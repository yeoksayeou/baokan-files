Xinhua News Agency, November 24th—In parts of North and Northwest China, wheat rust has occurred, and active prevention and control measures are currently underway, aiming for "early treatment and thorough eradication."

Since the beginning of autumn, these regions have experienced abundant rainfall, fog, and dew, with suitable temperatures and humidity. Coupled with early wheat sowing and a large number of volunteer wheat seedlings, there are many sources of the fungus. Therefore, wheat rust has occurred early in some areas. To prevent rust infection as early as possible, various localities are intensifying efforts to eliminate the sources of the fungus. In Binxian and Qianxian counties in Shaanxi Province, methods such as spraying salt water, ammonium sulfate solution, raw urine, and burying and cutting leaves are used to prevent and control stripe rust, concentrating efforts on treating disease centers, ensuring every plant is addressed and no plot is missed, with good results. In the Liaocheng area of Shandong, the whole area is checked for rust, and prevention and treatment follow. The People's Communes in Gaomi County have implemented the "five fixed" method, which includes assigning personnel, areas, time, results, and rewards, as well as a responsibility system that includes contracting for medicine and machinery and ensuring eradication, significantly improving the efficiency of rust prevention and control. Areas in Xinjiang where wheat rust has occurred have also deployed aircraft for spraying and prevention. All localities are prepared to seize the crucial period of the next twenty to thirty days to strengthen prevention and control work, striving to eliminate the source of the rust fungus before winter, creating favorable conditions for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

This year, various localities have focused on rust prevention as the first step in wheat planting. In many regions, the planting area of the "Bima No. 1" variety, which is susceptible to stripe rust, has been reduced and replaced by rust-resistant varieties such as "Nanda 2419" and "Baiyupi." In Henan Province alone, wheat fields that have changed varieties account for more than half of the original susceptible varieties. In Huazhou People's Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi, over 90% of all wheat fields have selected and replaced rust-resistant varieties for sowing.

According to Xinhua News Agency, in the rural areas of Anhui Province, where the "Three Autumns" work is basically completed, a large number of laborers are turning to wheat field management.

Based on the experience of wheat field management over the past few years, all localities have arranged more labor than in previous years as soon as autumn planting is completed, carrying out field management activities centered on ensuring complete and robust seedlings. In the Lu'an and Wuhu areas alone, more than 240,000 people have been mobilized to carry out meticulous and comprehensive management of wheat fields. They have inspected and ranked the wheat fields and adopted methods such as seedling cultivation and transplanting, transplanting dense seedlings to sparse areas, and accelerating germination for replanting to address the causes of seedling deficiency, primarily striving to ensure complete seedlings. In Tianchang County, Bengbu area, more than 4,000 people are dispatched every day to check and replant seedlings, and 2,800 acres of wheat fields with missing seedlings have been replanted. Guozhang Commune in this county conducted seedling checking and replanting plot by plot and ridge by ridge after the early-maturing wheat was planted. Wugou Commune in Suixi County also adopted methods such as spraying soil pesticides and applying "666" powder with water for irrigation, providing universal prevention and control for 1,600 acres of wheat fields affected by underground pests.

While checking and replanting seedlings, various localities also apply seedling fertilizer early, ensure rational irrigation and drainage, and carry out mid-tillage and weeding. In the Lu'an area, while replanting missing seedlings in wheat fields, fertilizer was applied and weeds were removed for more than 150,000 acres of wheat fields. Dangshan County in Huaibei generally irrigated 57,000 acres of wheat fields with a combination of applying quick-acting fertilizer. In order to increase production comprehensively, various localities have particularly strengthened the management of distant and poor fields. In Sanjian Commune, Dingyuan County, the wheat seedlings in more than 7,000 acres of distant and poor fields are being treated with a "biased feeding" approach. Seedling fertilizer has been applied to half of the wheat fields, and nearly 2,000 acres have been fertilized again for tillering after applying seedling fertilizer. Winter cultivation has also been carried out in some distant and poor fields.

According to Xinhua News Agency, winter sowing of spring wheat has begun in various parts of Qinghai Province. In some areas with earlier climates, winter sowing has already formed a high tide. Winter sowing in the deep mountain areas of Guide County has been basically completed.

Qinghai is a spring-sown crop region in our country. The main food crops here—spring wheat and highland barley, etc.—were originally sown in the spring. In recent years, various localities have actively experimented with and promoted winter sowing of spring wheat, which has not only obtained higher yields but also accumulated a set of relatively mature planting experiences. Experience has proven that as long as the sowing is timely, winter-sown spring wheat grows better than spring-sown wheat, has stronger disease resistance, cold resistance, and drought resistance, and has larger ears and fuller grains. Generally, it yields more than 10% higher than spring-sown spring wheat under the same management conditions. At the same time, winter sowing of some crops can alleviate the contradiction of having many and concentrated agricultural tasks in the spring and the difficulty in coordinating manpower, livestock power, and tools. It is of great significance for running agriculture on a large scale and increasing grain production. In order to make the winter sowing work timely and well done, all localities have strengthened leadership and immediately carried out various preparatory tasks for farming after the autumn harvest. All the fields planned for winter sowing throughout the province have been plowed at least once in the autumn, and some have been plowed two or three times. After plowing, they have been irrigated with autumn water and applied with base fertilizer, and have been harrowed and rolled to ensure that the land is flat, the soil is loose, and the moisture is sufficient. In the newly emerging state-owned farms in Yushu and Guoluo grasslands, leading cadres at the county and commune levels have gone deep into the fields during the preparatory work, focusing on plowing, accumulating fertilizer, selecting seeds, preparing agricultural tools, and imparting technology.

The Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Department of State Farms, the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and other units have dispatched a large number of technical personnel to form working teams, which are divided into groups to go to various prefectures and counties to contract for the technical guidance of winter sowing, assisting various localities to better realize the reform of the cropping system.

    华北、西北部分地区及时组织力量
    把麦锈病消灭在冬前
    安徽大力加强麦田管理　青海提高春麦冬播质量
    新华社24日讯　华北、西北部分地区发生小麦锈病，目前正在积极防治，以求“治早、治了”。
    入秋以来，这些地区多雨、多雾、多露，温度、湿度适宜，加上小麦播种早，自生麦苗数量大，菌源多，因此有些地方小麦锈病也发生得早。为了及早防止锈病感染，各地正加紧消灭菌源。陕西省邠县、乾县等地用喷洒食盐水、硫铵水、生尿水和埋土切叶等办法防治条锈病，集中力量治发病中心，株株俱到，块块不漏，效果良好。山东聊城专区结合查苗补苗工作，全面地检查麦苗锈病，随查随治。高密县各人民公社推行定人员、定地区、定时间、定效果、定报酬的“五定”办法，和包药械、包消灭的责任制度，显著提高了锈病防治效率。新疆发生麦锈病的地方，还出动飞机喷药防治。各地都准备抓紧最近二三十天的关键时期加强防治工作，力争把锈病菌源消灭在越冬以前，为明年小麦大丰收创造有利条件。
    今年各地在种麦时，就先抓了防治锈病这一环。不少地区对感染条锈病的“碧玛一号”品种的种植面积已缩小，代之以“南大二四一九”、“白玉皮”等抗锈耐锈品种。仅河南一省改换品种的麦田，就占原有感病品种的一半以上。陕西渭南县华州人民公社全部麦田90％以上都选换了抗锈耐锈品种来播种。
    据新华社讯　三秋工作基本结束的安徽农村，大批劳动力正转入小麦田间管理。
    各地根据几年来小麦田间管理的经验，在秋种一结束后就及早安排了比往年更多的劳力，开展以苗齐苗壮为中心的田间管理活动。仅六安、芜湖两个专区，就腾出了二十四万多人进行麦田的细管、全管工作。他们对麦田作了检查排队，针对缺苗原因，分别采取育苗移栽、移稠补稀和催芽补种等办法，首先争取苗齐。蚌埠专区天长县每天出动四千多人查苗补苗，已把二千八百亩的缺苗断垅麦田补齐。这个县的国章公社在早茬麦种完以后，就逐丘逐垅地进行了查苗补种。濉溪县五沟公社还采取土农药喷杀和“六六六”粉随水灌田等办法，把一千六百亩受地下虫害的麦田普遍防治了一遍。
    各地在查苗补苗的同时，还早施苗肥，合理排灌和中耕除草。六安专区在补齐了麦田缺苗的同时，为十五万多亩麦田追了肥、锄了草。淮北砀山县，在五万七千多亩麦田里，结合追施速效肥普遍浇了一次水。为了全面增产，各地特别加强了远田薄地的管理。定远县桑涧公社对七千多亩远田薄地的麦苗，采取“偏吃偏喝”的办法，已在半数的麦田里追施了出苗肥，并有近两千亩在追过出苗肥以后，又追了一次分蘖肥，并在部分远田薄地作了冬锄。
    据新华社讯　青海省各地春小麦的冬季播种工作已经开始。一些气候较早的地区，冬播工作已经形成高潮。贵德县深山区的冬播工作已经基本结束。
    青海是我国的春播作物区，这里的主要粮食作物——春小麦和青稞等原来都在春季播种。几年来，各地积极试验和推广春麦冬种，不仅获得了较高的产量，也积累了一套比较成熟的种植经验。经验证明，只要播种适时，冬播的春麦都比春播的长得好，抗病抗寒抗旱能力较强，穗大粒饱，一般比各项管理条件相同的春播春麦增产10％以上，同时，冬季播种一部分作物可以缓和春季农活多而集中和人力畜力工具不易调配的矛盾，对于大办农业、大办粮食有着十分重要的意义。为了使冬播工作做得及时，做得好，各地都加强了领导，在秋收以后就立即进行各项备耕工作。全省计划冬播的田地都至少秋翻了一遍，有的翻耕了两三遍，翻后都浇了秋水，施了基肥，经过耙耱镇压，做到地平土碎墒足。在新兴的农垦区玉树和果洛草原，县和公社各级领导干部在备耕中纷纷深入田间，狠抓翻地、积肥、选种、农具准备和技术传授等工作。
    青海省农林厅、农垦厅、农林科学院等单位抽调了大批技术人员，组成了工作队，分组到各州、县，分片包干冬播的技术指导工作，协助各地更好地实现耕作制度的改革。（附图片）
