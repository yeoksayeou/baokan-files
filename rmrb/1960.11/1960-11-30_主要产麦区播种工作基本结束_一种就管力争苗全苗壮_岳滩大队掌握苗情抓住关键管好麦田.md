Xinhua News Agency report: Major wheat-producing areas in our country have basically completed autumn sowing of wheat and have promptly shifted to seedling management. Currently, various regions are grasping measures such as winter irrigation to preserve soil moisture, inter-tillage, top dressing, and insect and rust prevention, laying the foundation for safe overwintering of wheat and a good return to green next year.

Adhering to the spirit of "one sowing, one management," all wheat-producing areas have been managing while sowing during the wheat sowing period. After sowing, seedling management work was carried out promptly. In some areas, to do a good job in field management, production teams of various communes made practical arrangements for the labor force for wheat field management. According to the foundation of wheat sowing and seedling emergence, different management methods were adopted in light of local conditions. Replanting was carried out in wheat fields that were sowed early for drought resistance or that had missing seedlings due to rough soil preparation; seedling fertilizer was applied to wheat fields with insufficient base fertilizer; irrigation was carried out early in areas with poor soil moisture during sowing to strengthen soil moisture preservation. Areas with more autumn rainfall also seized favorable opportunities to store water. Shanxi Province, in addition to timely checking and replanting seedlings, also top-dressed fertilizer and renovated the ridges, striving for full seedlings in every mu. Wheat-growing areas in Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi and other provinces paid close attention to insect and rust prevention, disseminating rust prevention knowledge and experience early in an effort to eliminate pests and diseases in the early stages of development.

This year's autumn wheat sowing work in various regions was carried out under the situation of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain. Cadres at all levels went deep into the front line of production, eating, living and laboring with the commune members, participating in production, and leading production, implementing various yield-increasing measures in a specific way according to local conditions. Therefore, under the circumstances that the area of late autumn crops was large and the stubble was relatively tight this year, some areas also expanded a part of the wheat sowing area, the sowing quality was also improved, and the seedling emergence was relatively good. In Hunan Province, where wheat was planted less in the past, cadres at all levels used methods such as planting experimental fields to play a good role in promoting the completion of the wheat sowing plan in the province.

This newspaper reported that Yuetan Brigade of Zhai Town People's Commune in Yanshi County, Henan Province, mobilized the masses to conduct comparative education, sum up yield-increasing experiences, implement management measures, and actively strengthen wheat field management to promote more tillering, strong tillering, and good root development of wheat before winter.

After the end of wheat sowing, a few party members, cadres, and some commune members in Yuetan Brigade had varying degrees of blindly optimistic sentiments in their thinking. This year's base fertilizer for wheat fields was indeed more sufficient and of better quality than last year, but compared with the requirements for a large increase in wheat production next year, it is far from being able to meet the needs. In particular, wheat fields have generally implemented intercropping and mixed cropping, which requires more fertilizer to supply the growth needs of wheat and vegetables. In particular, there are still a small number of wheat fields where the base fertilizer is not evenly applied, or no base fertilizer is applied at all. At the same time, there was drought in the early period of this year, and the base moisture was insufficient, requiring timely irrigation to consolidate the soil; the autumn harvest was later, and the sowing time was generally delayed by five or six days. In addition, the "Beginning of Spring" this year is within the year, and the wheat winter growing time is short, so management must not be relaxed. Therefore, the brigade party branch decided that it must carry out ideological mobilization, and on this basis strengthen winter wheat field management.

In order to improve the ideological understanding of cadres and commune members and clarify the current wheat seedling growth situation, the brigade party general branch carried out mobilization from top to bottom at all levels, and organized cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to go deep into the fields to conduct consultations and study winter wheat field management measures. During the consultation, the brigade party general branch used the field as a classroom and wheat seedlings as teaching materials, using the methods of on-site observation and practical comparison to educate everyone. Through example comparisons, everyone generally realized that if wheat seedlings are to be fertile and strong, water and fertilizer must keep up. The final conclusion reached by everyone was: It depends on human effort, and wheat depends on human management. If you want to obtain high yields, you must firmly grasp the key. The growth of wheat seedlings is currently in the "two roads" period. If managed well, wheat will have more heads within the year and fewer heads after the new year, in order to achieve the goal of low stalks, thick stalks, many heads, large ears, and full grains, and achieve high yields in every block; if managed poorly, the wheat seedlings will be yellow, thin, and weak, with fewer tillers within the year and more heads after the new year, affecting overall yield increase. Everyone unanimously stated: We must conscientiously manage the wheat fields well.

Combined with field consultations, each production team classified and ranked wheat seedlings by square, block, and piece, and explained the results of the ranking and the reasons for the formation of each type of wheat seedling to the masses truthfully. Of the 12,390 mu of wheat in the entire brigade, the first-class wheat with black, green, fertile and strong growth accounted for 36%; the second-class seedlings with tender green wheat seedlings due to excessive previous crops, thin soil, and lack of moisture accounted for 39%; and the third-class seedlings with yellow and thin wheat seedlings due to late sowing, lack of fertilizer, and lack of moisture accounted for 25%. Through ranking, the broad masses realized that the key to current wheat field management is to apply more fertilizer, apply good fertilizer, irrigate sufficiently, and eliminate third-class seedlings in advance. The brigade party general branch synthesized opinions from all parties and put forward different requirements for different wheat seedlings.

According to the requirements of the brigade, each production team further mobilized the masses and formulated specific measures for wheat field management, and carried out fertilizer accumulation and top dressing in a timely manner. At the same time, the brigade took out 13,000 yuan from the production investment contract fee as a reward fund for purchasing household fertilizer and accumulating fertilizer from commune members, pricing according to quality and paying in a timely manner. Each production team fixed about 60% of the labor force and vigorously engaged in fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production and top dressing. The fourteenth production team has a reasonable quota and an over-quota reward system for both collective fertilizer accumulation and individual fertilizer accumulation by commune members. Each group and household has set a plan, and the labor enthusiasm of the commune members is high. It has now accumulated hundreds of dan of human manure and several carts of high-quality fertilizer for each mu of wheat field. At present, the entire brigade has prepared a certain amount of fertilizer for each mu of wheat field. In addition to applying quick-acting nitrogen fertilizers such as human manure and strong soil to 420 mu of third-class seedlings in remote areas, thin land, and yellow wheat seedlings, about 30% of the wheat field fertilizer has been sent to the field. Combined with fertilizer accumulation and top dressing, field engineering renovation, machinery and tool matching, and tool reform were also carried out to prepare for winter irrigation.

    主要产麦区播种工作基本结束
    一种就管力争苗全苗壮
    岳滩大队掌握苗情抓住关键管好麦田
    据新华社讯　我国主要产麦区基本结束小麦秋种工作，及时转入苗期管理。目前各地正在抓冬灌保墒、中耕、追肥、防虫治锈等措施，为小麦安全越冬和明年过好返青关打下基础。
    各麦产区本着一种就管的精神，在麦播期间就边种边管，播种结束后，及时进行了苗期管理工作。有些地区为做好田间管理，由各公社的生产小队切实安排了麦田管理的劳力，根据麦播的基础和出苗情况，因地制宜地采取了不同的管理办法，对早期抗旱播种或因整地较粗糙而出现的缺苗断垅麦田进行了补种；对底肥不很充足的麦田追补了苗肥；对播种时墒情较差的提早灌溉，加强保墒工作。秋季雨水较多的地区，还抓住有利时机蓄水。山西省除及时地进行了查苗补苗外，还追肥和整修了畦田，力争亩亩全苗。河南、河北、陕西等省的种麦区十分注意防虫治锈工作，及早地传播防锈知识和经验，力争把虫、病消灭在初发阶段。
    今年各地的小麦秋播工作，是在大办农业，大办粮食的形势下进行的，各地各级干部都深入生产第一线，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，参加生产，领导生产，因地制宜地具体贯彻各项增产措施。因而，在今年晚秋作物面积大，茬口相接比较紧的情况下，有一些地区还扩大了一部分麦播面积，播种质量也有所改进，出苗情况比较良好。过去种麦较少的湖南省，今年各级干部用种试验田等办法，对推动全省完成小麦播种计划起了良好作用。
    本报讯　河南偃师县翟镇人民公社岳滩大队，发动群众进行对比教育，总结增产经验，落实管理措施，积极加强麦田管理，促使小麦冬前多分蘖、分壮蘖、盘好根。
    岳滩大队在小麦播种结束以后，有少数党员、干部和部分社员在思想上有程度不同的盲目乐观情绪。今年的麦田底肥的确比去年施得足、质量较好，但和明年小麦大增产的要求来比，则是远远不能满足的。尤其麦田普遍实行了复播套种，间作混作，这就要求有更多的肥料来供给小麦和蔬菜生长的需要，特别是还有少部分麦田底肥施的不匀，或根本未施底肥，同时，今年前期干旱，底墒不足，需要适时灌溉，塌实土壤；秋收腾茬较晚，播种时间一般推迟了五、六天，加上今年“立春”在年内，小麦冬季生长时间短，绝不能放松管理。因此，大队党支部决定，必须进行思想发动，在这个基础上加强冬季麦田管理。
    为了提高干部和社员的思想认识，澄清当前麦苗生长情况，大队党总支一面自上而下层层进行发动，一面组织干部、老农、技术员，深入田间，进行会诊，研究冬前麦田管理措施。在会诊中，大队党总支以田间为课堂，以麦苗为教材，现场观察，实地对比的方法，来教育大家。通过实例对比，使大家普遍认识到，要想麦苗肥壮，水肥必须跟上。最后大家得出的结论是：事在人为，麦在人管，要想获得高产，必须狠抓关键。现在麦苗生长正处在“两条路”的时期，管得好，小麦年内多盘头，过年少撇头，才能达到秆低、秆粗、头多、穗大、粒饱的目的，实现块块高产；管得不好，麦苗黄瘦细弱，年内发杈少，过了年撇头多，影响全面增产。大家一致表示：要切切实实地把麦田管理好。
    结合田间会诊，各生产队逐方逐块逐片对麦苗进行了分类站队，并把站队的结果和各类麦苗形成的原因，原原本本地向群众讲清楚。全大队一万二千三百九十亩小麦，生长黑绿肥壮的一类麦占36％；因前茬过重、地薄墒缺，麦苗嫩绿的二类苗占39％；播种较晚、缺肥欠墒，麦苗黄瘦的三类苗有25％。通过站队，广大群众认识到当前麦田管理的关键，是多追肥、追好肥、浇足水，提前消灭三类苗。大队党总支综合了各方面意见，对不同麦苗提出了不同要求。
    各生产队根据大队的要求，进一步发动了群众，制订了麦田管理的具体措施，及时进行了积肥、追肥。同时，大队从生产投资包干费中，拿出一万三千元的资金，作为收购社员家庭肥和积肥奖励基金，以质论价，及时兑现。各生产队都固定60％左右的劳动力，大搞积肥造肥和追肥。第十四生产队由于集体积肥和社员个人积肥都有合理的定额和超额奖励制度，组组、户户都订计划，社员劳动热情高涨，现在已为每亩麦田积攒好几百担人粪尿和几车优质肥料。目前，全大队已为每亩麦田准备了一定数量的肥料，除对远地、薄地、麦苗发黄的三类苗四百二十亩追施了人粪尿、壮土等速效性氮肥外，并有30％左右的麦田肥料已送到地头。结合积肥、追肥，还进行了整修田间工程、机具配套、改革工具等工作，为冬灌作好了准备。
