    Advancing Shoulder to Shoulder with Our Loved Ones
    Bai Sheng
    In the surging revolutionary tide of "Go to the agricultural front!", batches of revolutionary cadres, workers, and officers' families have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and rushed to the agricultural front with great enthusiasm. They are determined to make contributions to the country in the battle to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, in the glorious agricultural labor posts!
    Today, our newspaper introduces some vivid stories of cadres' families, workers' families, and officers' families participating in agricultural production: Here we have Wang Huazi, a cadre's family member who has persisted in labor for 21 consecutive years and has been awarded the title of labor model for 16 consecutive years; Yu Guilan, an officer's family member who responded to the Party's call and settled down in the countryside from the city; Zhu Linmei, a worker's family member who resolutely plunged into the front line of agricultural production, and others. Although these families are not exactly the same, they all, like their loved ones, resolutely listen to the Party and contribute all their strength to the places where the Party and the people need them most.
    The vast majority of family members are women. Their participation in labor not only plays a significant role in strengthening the agricultural front, but also has a positive impact on promoting new social customs. In the old society, family members generally had the idea of relying on their husbands. Although this idea has changed greatly now, its remnants still more or less affect some family members with relatively backward thinking. When Wang Huazi first participated in agricultural labor, didn't some women in the village with backward thinking try to persuade her not to participate in labor and rely on her husband for a living! But Wang Huazi did not listen to these words and has always insisted on participating in agricultural production. She said to others, "As cadres' family members, we should have higher awareness with the help of our spouses, and we should take the lead in labor and not have any special privileges." How ambitious she is! Wang Huazi's idea and style of taking pride in farming, enjoying farming, and loving agricultural labor embodies the heroic spirit of Chinese women under the education of the Party. Today, in the upsurge of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, batches of cadres have stepped onto the agricultural front line. What should the cadres' families do? They should, like Wang Huazi and others, resolutely plunge into agricultural production and into the cause of socialist construction, and advance shoulder to shoulder with their loved ones. As the cadres' family members of the Huopen Commune said, "If cadres are red, cadres' families are also red." These two sentences can be used as the action guideline for the grassroots cadres' families of the Huopen Commune, and also as the action guideline for all cadres' families.
    Chairman Mao said: "The countryside is a vast world where there is much to be done." If cadres' families want to be red, they should go to this vast world and become a fighting force in agricultural production. It cannot be said that moving from the small world of the family to the vast world of the countryside is a huge change, but this change is an important sign of keeping up with the times and the new revolutionary trend. This is a great time for ambitious cadres' families to establish great ambitions and show their talents. Families of all revolutionary workers, the motherland needs you to emit more light and more heat, and you must integrate your thoughts and actions with the revolutionary torrent of the motherland. You are all families of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary officers, and you must take the lead in standing on the front line of supporting agricultural production and make outstanding contributions to vigorously developing agriculture and grain production together with your loved ones.

    和亲人们齐步前进  
    柏生
    在“到农业战线去！”的汹涌澎湃的革命浪潮中，一批批革命干部、职工、军官的家属们，热烈地响应了党的号召，满怀热情地奔赴农业战线。她们决心在大办农业、大办粮食的战斗中，在光荣的农业劳动岗位上，为祖国立功！
    本报今天介绍了一些干部家属、职工家属、军官家属参加农业生产的生动事迹：这里有连续二十一年坚持劳动、连续十六年获得劳动模范称号的机关干部家属王花子，有响应党的号召，从城市中到农村安家落户的军官家属于桂兰，有坚决投入到农业生产第一线的职工家属朱林妹等。这些人的家庭虽然不尽相同，但她们都像她们的亲人一样，坚决听党的话，把自己的全部力量，贡献到党和人民最需要的地方去。
    家属中绝大多数是妇女。她们参加劳动，不仅对加强农业战线有重大作用，就是对发扬社会新风尚也会有良好影响。过去在旧社会里，家属中一般存在着依赖丈夫的思想。现在这种思想已经有极大改变，但它的残余也还或多或少的影响着某些思想比较落后的家属。王花子开始参加农业劳动时，村里个别思想落后的妇女，不就曾劝说她不必参加劳动，依赖丈夫生活吗！可是王花子没有听这些话，一直坚持参加农业生产。她对别人说：“咱们干部家属，按说有爱人帮助，觉悟高，更应带头劳动，不该有半点特殊。”看她这话说得多么有志气。王花子的这种以农为荣，以农为乐，热爱农业劳动的思想和风格，正表现了在党的教育下，我国妇女的英雄气概。今天，在大办农业、大办粮食的热潮中，干部一批批走上了农业第一线，干部的家属应当怎样呢？应当像王花子等一样，坚决投身到农业生产中去，投身到社会主义建设事业中去，和她们的亲人齐步前进。正如火盆公社干部家属所说的那样：“干部红，干部家属也红”。这两句话，可以做为火盆公社基层干部家属的行动指针，也可以做为一切干部家属的行动指针。
    毛主席说：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”。干部家属要红，就应当到这个广阔的天地里去，成为农业生产的一支战斗力量。从家庭的小天地走上广阔的农村大天地，不能不说是一个巨大的变化，但这个变化，正是跟上时代的步伐，跟上新的革命潮流的重要标志。这正是有志气的干部家属们大树雄心、大显身手的大好时候。一切革命工作人员的家属们，祖国需要你们发出更多的光，更多的热，你们必须把自己的思想、行动和祖国革命的洪流汇合在一起。你们都是革命干部、革命职工、革命军官的家属，一定要带头挺身站到支援农业生产的最前线去，和你们的亲人一起为大办农业、大办粮食做出出色的贡献来。
