Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: Today marks the sixth anniversary of the heroic Algerian people's nationwide armed uprising. People from all walks of life in the capital solemnly gathered to pay tribute to the valiant Algerian people and express that the 650 million Chinese people will forever and resolutely support them until they win the final victory.

Today's meeting was held in the auditorium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). This meeting was convened by various people's organizations in our country in response to the appeal of various people's organizations in Algeria and the call of the International Trade Union Support Algerian Workers and People's Committee meeting held recently in Cuba regarding "Support Algeria Day."

In the center of the rostrum today hung the national flags of China and Algeria. At 3:00 p.m., Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Li Jiebo, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity Liao Chengzhi, and others, along with Afar Abdul Madi, head of the Algerian Art Troupe, Malan Tanko Yakasai, national organizer of the Northern Elements Progressive Union of Nigeria, Alau Aka Bashioren, Nigerian trade union worker, Ahmed Mohammed Keir, Sudanese peace person, and others, stepped onto the rostrum. At this moment, thunderous applause erupted from the audience.

Bao Er-han, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity and Vice President of the Chinese- African Peoples's Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech, first expressing full support and high respect to the Algerian people who are carrying out a heroic armed struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for national independence.

Bao Er-han highly praised the victory of the Algerian people, pointing out that the struggle of the Algerian people has heavily hit French imperialism and the supporters of French imperialism, the most vicious enemy of the world's people—U.S. imperialism. It has greatly encouraged the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to strive for national independence, democratic freedom, and determination, and has also made significant contributions to the cause of defending world peace. He said that the great victory of the Algerian people eloquently proves that despite the barbaric armed suppression and cunning political deception adopted by imperialists and colonialists, they cannot defeat the awakened and united people, nor can they save their inevitable fate of collapse; at the same time, it also powerfully proves that the power of the people is infinite and invincible, while imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger that appears strong on the outside but is weak on the inside.

Bao Er-han said that our 650 million Chinese people resolutely and consistently support the just struggle of the Algerian people until they achieve the final victory of national liberation. The people of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world stand on the side of the Algerian people. Victory belongs to the glorious Algerian people.

Li Jiebo, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting, saying: The Chinese people care about the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation as much as they care about their own cause. Our interests are completely aligned. The 650 million Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Algerian people. On this solemn day of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian people's nationwide armed uprising, Li Jiebo, on behalf of the people of the capital, extended high respect to the Algerian people. He said that the great victory achieved by the Algerian people in the past six years "once again proves that imperialism, which represents the forces of decay, is actually weak despite its apparent strength. Their temporary arrogance is nothing but a death struggle, and what is truly powerful and invincible is by no means the decadent imperialism, but the awakened people who are united and persist in revolutionary struggle." He pointed out: "The Algerian people, who have been tempered by the flames of revolutionary war, will surely achieve the final victory." Li Jiebo said that the national liberation war waged by the Algerian people is a glorious example of the African national liberation movement.

He revealed that the more insidious and vicious U.S. imperialism, while helping the French colonialists massacre the Algerian people through various "aid" programs, is trying to infiltrate its own forces into Algeria and is trying to use the evil conspiracy of swallowing up the Congo under the banner of the United Nations to invade the entire Africa. Li Jiebo said that the Algerian people's struggle will be a long-term and arduous one. However, "the future of the Algerian people's struggle is infinitely bright, because the war they are waging is a just and progressive war."

He pointed out: "The main factor determining the outcome of a war is not weapons, but the support of the people."

He said: "As long as the strength of the broad masses of the Algerian people is fully mobilized, unity is strengthened, struggle is persisted in, the enemy is constantly attacked, and oneself is strengthened, one can grow from small to large, turn from weak to strong, transform inferiority into superiority, overcome all difficulties, persevere in the struggle to the end, drive out imperialism, and achieve thorough national independence."

Li Jiebo pointed out: "All people who dare to rise up to fight for independence and freedom, who dare to rise up to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and colonialism, are invincible."

Afar Abdul Madi, head of the Algerian Art Troupe, was invited to speak at the meeting. He said that they were glad and honored that the heroic Chinese people were commemorating their revolutionary day with them today. He said: "Thanks to the courage and selflessness of each of our patriots, and the firm determination of our urban and rural residents, our people will surely defeat imperialism and win national independence."

In his speech, Afar severely condemned the bloody crimes committed by French imperialism in Algeria. He pointed out: "France has received the support of imperialist countries headed by the United States. They have established a real alliance to deal with our country. This proves the weakness of the imperialist dinosaur. In the face of the courage and invincible power of the people of a small country who have stood up to fight for their rights, imperialism is just a 'clay giant,' that is, the 'paper tiger' that Chairman Mao Zedong said."

He emphasized: "The Algerian people are not isolated. Their friends are stronger than their enemies. The forces of imperialism are doomed to die because they are upholding dying principles."

Afar said that the war would be long-term, but the heroic Algerian people were prepared to overcome all difficulties until the war was won. Afar pointed out that many freedom-loving countries have recognized the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, and the Algerian people are proud that the People's Republic of China is among them. He said that the government of the People's Republic of China and the heroic Chinese people have taken advantage of many historically significant opportunities to announce the 650 million Chinese friends’ firm support and active assistance to the Algerian people who are fighting for liberation. He expressed his heartfelt and eternal gratitude for this, and expressed his firm determination to strive for the final victory.

Malan Tanko Yakasai, national organizer of the Northern Elements Progressive Union of Nigeria, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that November 1st is a great day for the Algerian people and all peoples of all countries who have suffered from imperialist intimidation, persecution and exploitation.

He said: "What is happening in Algeria today is exactly what happened in China before the liberation of the Chinese people. These two experiences tell us that once imperialist forces penetrate a country, they can only be driven out of that country through the armed struggle of the people."

Yakasai said that we should not mistakenly believe that the struggle of those countries that have achieved political independence is over when they gain independence. Political independence is one thing, and economic freedom is another. In the vast majority of these countries, the real struggle has just begun.

Yakasai said, I would like to appeal to all sincere people in the world to form a united front against French imperialism supported by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other imperialist countries, and to support the Algerian people politically, morally and in other ways.

Alau Aka Bashioren, a Nigerian trade union worker, said in his speech that when the Algerian people's struggle is victorious, imperialism and all reactionaries are continuing to be defeated and will only be crushed through armed struggle.

In his speech, Bashioren quoted Chairman Mao's words: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," and "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor." Bashioren said that as the facts show, imperialism, which has an overwhelming advantage in terms of the quality and quantity of manpower and weapons, has failed despite launching a devastating campaign against the Algerian people. All the military and financial resources of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, composed of world imperialist countries under the leadership of U.S. monopoly capital, have not made the Algerian people give up their firm belief in achieving self-determination through struggle.

Bashioren finally said excitedly: Let us declare to the world our unwavering determination to eliminate imperialism and colonialism from the earth so that the people of all countries can gain freedom and liberation and enjoy peace.

Ahmed Mohammed Keir, a Sudanese peace person, warmly praised the armed revolutionary struggle in Algeria in his speech, saying that the only language understood by bloodthirsty imperialists is the broad and organized struggle of the masses.

In his speech, Keir strongly condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in supporting French imperialism, and warmly praised the Chinese people's support for the Algerian people and the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian peoples. He said that this great friendship is like a javelin inserted into the heart of the U.S.-led imperialism. Developing this friendship is the sacred task of us Africans who strive to defeat imperialism and colonialism in Africa.

All the speeches at the meeting aroused bursts of warm applause. Then the meeting passed a telegram to the Algerian people, expressing firm support for the just struggle of the Algerian people.

The initiators of today's conference were: All-China Federation of Trade Unions, China Peace Committee, Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, Chinese-African Peoples's Friendship Association, All-China Women's Federation, All-China Youth Federation, and All-China Students' Federation. The heads of these people's organizations and people from all aspects of the capital and Beijing, Qu Wu, Yang Zhihua, Zhang Chao, Yang Shuo, Hu Qili, Wu Qing, Le Songsheng, Lao She, Peng Siming, Pu Jiexiu, Guan Shixiong, and Zeng Dian, attended the meeting.

Artists from the Algerian Art Troupe, which is visiting Beijing, and foreign guests from other African countries, attended today's meeting. After the meeting, literary and art workers in the capital and artists from the Algerian Art Troupe performed wonderful Chinese and Algerian song and dance programs. (Picture attached)

    首都各界隆重集会纪念阿尔及利亚全民武装起义六周年
    中国永远坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民正义斗争
    包尔汉、李颉伯表达了中国人民对阿人民的崇高敬意，深信觉醒了的人民只要坚持斗争必获最后胜利
    阿艺术团负责人和三位非洲外宾谴责帝国主义侵略非洲人民的罪行，表示埋葬殖民主义的坚强意志
    据新华社1日讯　今天是英雄的阿尔及利亚人民举行全民武装起义的六周年。首都各界人民隆重举行集会，向英勇战斗的阿尔及利亚人民致敬，并且表示六亿五千万中国人民永远地坚决地支持他们直到争取最后的胜利。
    今天大会在政协礼堂举行。这个大会是我国各人民团体为响应阿尔及利亚各人民团体的呼吁，响应最近在古巴举行的国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会会议关于“支援阿尔及利亚日”的号召而召开的。
    今天会场主席台正中高悬中国和阿尔及利亚两国的国旗。下午三时，陈毅副总理，中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志等，同阿尔及利亚艺术团负责人阿法·阿卜杜勒·玛蒂，尼日利亚北方进步分子联盟全国组织者马兰·坦科·亚卡赛，尼日利亚工会工作者阿劳·阿卡·巴肖伦，苏丹和平人士阿赫迈德·穆罕默德·凯尔等，一起走上主席台。这时，全场发出雷鸣般的掌声。
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席、中国非洲人民友好协会副会长包尔汉致开会词，他首先向为反对帝国主义和殖民主义，为争取民族独立而进行英勇的武装斗争的阿尔及利亚人民，表示全力的支持和崇高的敬意。
    包尔汉对阿尔及利亚人民的胜利给予了高度的评价，他指出，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争沉重地打击了法帝国主义和法帝国主义的支持者、世界人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义。大大地鼓舞了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲被压迫人民争取民族独立、民主自由的信心与决心，同时也为保卫世界和平的事业作出了重大的贡献。他说，阿尔及利亚人民的伟大胜利，雄辩地证明：尽管帝国主义者、殖民主义者采取了野蛮的武装镇压和狡猾的政治欺骗，都不能打败觉醒起来、团结起来的人民，挽回它们必然崩溃的命运；同时也有力地证明了人民的力量是无穷无尽的，是不可战胜的，而帝国主义只不过是外强中干的纸老虎。
    包尔汉说，我们六亿五千万中国人民，坚决地、一贯地支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，直到他们取得民族解放的最后胜利。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都站在阿尔及利亚人民这一边。胜利属于光荣的阿尔及利亚人民。
    中华全国总工会副主席李颉伯在会上讲话，他说：中国人民像关心着自己的事业一样，关心着阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放的斗争。我们的利益是完全一致的。六亿五千万中国人民始终是阿尔及利亚人民最可靠的朋友。在阿尔及利亚人民举行全民武装起义六周年这个庄严的日子里，李颉伯代表首都人民向阿尔及利亚人民致以崇高的敬意。他说，阿尔及利亚人民六年来所取得的伟大胜利，“又一次证明了代表腐朽势力的帝国主义虽然貌似强大，实际上是虚弱的。他们一时猖獗，不过是垂死的挣扎，真正有力量和不可战胜的绝不是腐朽的帝国主义，而是觉醒了的、团结起来坚持革命斗争的人民。”他指出：“久经革命战火锻炼的阿尔及利亚人民必将获得最后的胜利”。李颉伯说，阿尔及利亚人民所进行的民族解放战争，是非洲民族解放运动的一个光辉榜样。
    他揭露说，更加阴险、更加凶恶的美帝国主义，在通过种种“援助”，帮助法国殖民者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的同时，正在力图把自己的势力渗入阿尔及利亚，正在力图把打着联合国旗号鲸吞刚果的罪恶阴谋，用于对整个非洲的侵略。李颉伯说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争将是长期的、艰苦的。但是，“阿尔及利亚人民斗争的前途是无限光明的，因为他们所进行的战争是正义的、进步的战争。”
    他指出：“决定战争胜负的主要因素不是武器，而是人心的向背。”
    他说：“只要把阿尔及利亚广大人民的力量充分地动员起来，加强团结，坚持斗争，不断地打击敌人，壮大自己，就能够从小到大，由弱变强，从劣势转为优势，就能够排除万难，把斗争坚持到底，把帝国主义赶出去，实现彻底的民族独立。”
    李颉伯指出：“一切敢于起来争取独立自由，敢于起来同帝国主义、殖民主义进行坚决斗争的人民，都是不可战胜的。”
    阿尔及利亚艺术团负责人阿法·阿卜杜勒·玛蒂应邀在会上讲话，他说，他们感到高兴和荣幸的是，英雄的中国人民今天和他们一道纪念他们革命的日子。他说：“由于我们每一个爱国者勇敢和忘我的精神，由于我们城乡居民坚定的决心，我国人民定将战胜帝国主义并获得民族独立。”
    阿法在讲话中严厉谴责了法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚所制造的血腥罪行。他指出：“法国得到了以美国为首的帝国主义国家的支持，它们建立了真正的联盟来对付我们的国家，这证明了帝国主义这条恐龙的软弱，在一个已经站起来为自己的权利而斗争的小国人民的勇气和不可战胜的力量面前，帝国主义只不过是一个‘泥塑巨人’，也就是毛泽东主席所说的‘纸老虎’。”
    他强调说：“阿尔及利亚人民不是孤立的，他们的朋友比敌人更为强大。帝国主义势力是要死亡的，因为它们维护着垂死的原则。”
    阿法说，战争将是长期的，但是，英勇的阿尔及利亚人民准备克服一切困难直到战争胜利为止。阿法指出，许多爱好自由的国家都已承认了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府，阿尔及利亚人民感到骄傲的是其中包括中华人民共和国。他说，中华人民共和国政府和英雄的中国人民业已利用多次富有历史意义的机会宣布了六亿五千万中国朋友对为争取解放而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民的坚决支持和积极支援。对此他表示衷心的永远的感谢，并且表示了争取最后胜利的坚强决心。
    尼日利亚北方进步分子联盟全国组织者马兰·坦科·亚卡赛在会上讲话。他指出，11月1日对阿尔及利亚人民和一切遭受帝国主义威吓、迫害和剥削的各国人民说来，是一个伟大的日子。
    他说：“今天在阿尔及利亚发生的事情正是中国人民解放以前在中国发生的事情，这两个经验告诉我们，一旦帝国主义势力伸入某个国家，只有通过人民的武装斗争才能把它们从那个国家赶走”。
    亚卡赛说，我们不应该错误地认为，当获得独立后，那些取得政治独立的国家的斗争就算是过去了。政治独立是一回事，而经济自由是另一回事，在极大多数的这些国家中，真正的斗争还刚开始。
    亚卡赛说，我愿向全世界一切真诚的人民呼吁，要求他们结成一个反对北大西洋公约盟国和其它帝国主义国家所支持的法帝国主义的统一战线，从政治上、道义上和其他方面支持阿尔及利亚人民。
    尼日利亚工会工作者阿劳·阿卡·巴肖伦在讲话中谈到阿尔及利亚人民斗争胜利的时候，指出帝国主义和一切反动派正在继续被击败，并且只有通过武装斗争才会被粉碎。
    巴肖伦在讲话中引用毛主席的话说：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”，“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素”。巴肖伦说，正如事实所表明，在人力和武器的质与量方面均占压倒优势的帝国主义，尽管对阿尔及利亚人民发动了毁灭性的战役，然而它们失败了。在美国垄断资本领导下的、由世界帝国主义国家组成的北大西洋公约组织的全部军事和财政资源并没有使阿尔及利亚人民放弃他们以斗争实现自决的坚强信心。
    巴肖伦最后激昂地说道：让我们向世界宣布我们要把帝国主义和殖民主义从地球上消灭掉的不可动摇的决心，从而使各国人民都能获得自由与解放，享受和平。
    苏丹和平人士阿赫迈德·穆罕默德·凯尔在讲话中热情赞扬阿尔及利亚的武装革命斗争，他说，嗜血成性的帝国主义者所能理解的唯一语言就是群众的广泛和有组织的斗争。
    凯尔在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义和北大西洋公约组织国家支持法国帝国主义的罪行，并且热情地赞扬中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的支持和中、阿两国人民的友谊。他说，这种伟大友谊就像插在以美国为首的帝国主义心窝上的一支投枪。发展这一友谊是我们力求在非洲击败帝国主义和殖民主义的非洲人的神圣任务。
    大会上的所有讲话都激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。接着大会通过了向阿尔及利亚人民发出的通电，表示坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争。
    发起举行今天这个大会的是：全国总工会、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国亚非团结委员会、中国非洲人民友好协会、全国妇女联合会、全国青年联合会、全国学生联合会。这些人民团体的负责人、首都和北京市各方面的人士屈武、杨之华、张超、杨朔、胡启立、吴青、乐松生、老舍、彭思明、浦洁修、关世雄、曾典等，都参加了大会。
    正在北京访问的阿尔及利亚艺术团的艺术家们，和非洲其他国家的外宾，参加了今天的大会。大会以后，首都文艺工作者和阿尔及利亚艺术团的艺术家们，演出了中、阿两国精彩的歌舞节目。（附图片）
