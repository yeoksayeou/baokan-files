Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 24th: The Eighth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea successfully concluded today. The session put forward programmatic and specific measures to further promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. The 187 deputies attending the meeting also very satisfactorily discussed and adopted the "Resolution on the Implementation of the First Five-Year Plan (1957-1961) for the National Economy."

The meeting conducted the third and fourth items on the agenda this morning. At the meeting, the decrees issued by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly from the Seventh Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly to this session were unanimously approved, and it was unanimously agreed to remove the positions of the President of the Supreme People's Court, Ho Chong-suk (due to illness), and the Vice President, Kim Ha-un. Kim Ik-son was elected as the President of the Supreme People's Court, and Pang Hak-se and Li Tok-hyon as Vice Presidents.

The Eighth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea opened on the 19th. Premier Kim Il-sung, Chairman Choi Yong-kun, and Hong Myung-hee, Pak Chong-ae, Pak Kum-chol, and other Korean party and government leaders participated in the meeting from beginning to end.

Chairman Choi Yong-kun's report "On Further Promoting the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland" received great attention and full support from the participants. All the deputies present unanimously adopted the “Letter from the Supreme People’s Assembly of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, Political Parties, Social Organizations, and People of South Korea” and the “Opinion on Realizing Economic and Cultural Exchanges between North and South Korea and Seeking Independent Development of the South Korean National Economy.”

Vice Premier of the Cabinet of Korea, Li Jong-ok's report "On the Implementation of the First Five-Year Plan (1957-1961) for the National Economy" announced an inspiring news to the world. This is that Korea completed the gross industrial output value plan of the first five-year plan two and a half years ahead of schedule (that is, in June 1959). It is estimated that in the four years up to the end of this year, all sectors and indicators of the Korean national economy will comprehensively complete the five-year plan. According to preliminary statistics, Korea's gross industrial output value this year has increased by 2.5 times compared with 1956, and the gross agricultural output value has increased by 50%.

The meeting pointed out in the "Resolution on the Implementation of the First Five-Year Plan for the National Economy" that the great achievements made in the implementation of the first five-year plan are the result of the various correct policies adopted by the Republic Government to implement the economic policy of the Korean Workers' Party, and the result of the steel-like unity of all the working people around the Party and the government in the struggle to implement these policies, giving play to all creativity and selfless patriotism.

The resolution said that the political and economic strength established in the northern half of the Republic is a powerful inspiring force for mobilizing the South Korean people to fight for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and a solid guarantee that the destroyed South Korean economy can be restored in a short period of time after Korea is unified in the future. The resolution finally pointed out that in socialist construction, all the Korean people will continue to advance to higher heights with the spirit of Chollima.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 23rd: The Eighth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continued its plenary session today. More than a dozen speakers used vivid facts to tell about the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people under the wise leadership of the Workers' Party and Premier Kim Il-sung in successfully completing the first five-year plan (1957-1961).

Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Pak Kum-chol, said in his speech that the successful completion of the first five-year plan has great historical significance in Korea.

He said that the completion of the first five-year plan once again proved the correctness of the Party's policy, and that as long as the people are united and struggle, there is no task that cannot be completed. The seven-year plan, which will begin next year, will further strengthen our unity around the Party. With the ever-victorious Party, with strong heavy industry, with the experience of completing the first five-year plan, and with the Chollima movement, we will be able to achieve victory after victory.

Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Rim Kye-chol, said in his speech that the first five-year plan opened the Chollima era in Korea. The Korean people quickly built the foundation of the machinery industry with the spirit of saving every penny, and cultivated a large number of national cadres to manage more than 3,000 factories in a short period of time. The rapid growth of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the whole country can only be achieved in the era under the leadership of the Workers' Party.

After reporting the good situation of increased national income and reduced taxes, Minister of Finance Han Sang-du said that the Party has tried every means to increase production, conserve resources, tap potentials, and greatly improve the level of industrial and agricultural production. Responding to the call of the Party, the working people built more than 1,000 local industrial factories without national investment. However, we cannot be satisfied with the current level and must continue to successfully carry out the seven-year plan.

Vice Premier of the Cabinet Chung Il-ryong, Chairman of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Hyon Mu-kwang, Chairman of the South Pyongan Provincial Party Committee Pi Chang-nin, and Director of Hwanghae Iron Works Kim Hyong-sam, Director of Hungnam Fertilizer Plant Yang Tae-kun, etc., used specific figures to report on the achievements of Pyongyang, South Hamgyong Province, South Pyongan Province, and the above-mentioned factories in the implementation of the first five-year plan in industry, agriculture, culture, education, and construction, respectively. They pointed out that this is the victory of the Korean Workers' Party's economic policy and agricultural policy, and the victory over anti-Party sectarian elements and opposition to revisionism, conservatism, and dogmatism.

Minister of Higher Education, Kim Chong-heng, said when reporting on the development of higher education in Korea that Korea now has more than 8,400 schools at all levels, with more than 2.5 million students.

The speeches of Hong Won-gil, Director of Tokchon Automobile Factory, Kim Byong-su, Director of Kiyang Tractor Factory, Choi Sa-yon, Director of Chongjin Fisheries Enterprise, Pak Ki-sok, Chairman of Changdong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sukchon County, and construction worker Yun Byong-kwon, all received continuous applause from the audience. After reporting on the production achievements of their units and expressing their determination to continue to successfully implement the seven-year plan, they all expressed their willingness to use the cars produced by their factories to replace the broken ox carts in South Korea, use tractors to cultivate the barren land in South Korea, and use the grain they produce to provide relief to South Korean compatriots. Yun Byong-kwon said that if the South Korean authorities abandon their traitorous policy and accept our plan for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, our construction workers can immediately go to South Korea to help them build beautiful houses like the ones we live in.

    会议在今天上午进行了第三项和第四项议程，会上一致批准了最高人民会议常任委员会从第二届最高人民会议第七次会议到这次会议所发布的政令，一致同意免去最高人民裁判所所长许贞琡
  （因病）、副所长金夏云的职务，选举金翊善为最高人民裁判所所长，方学世、李德铉为副所长。
    朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第八次会议是在19日开幕的。金日成首相、崔庸健委员长和洪命熹、朴正爱、朴金喆等朝鲜党政领导人自始至终参加了这次会议。

    这次会议在“关于人民经济第一个五年计划执行情况的决议”中指出，在执行第一个五年计划中所取得的巨大成就，是共和国政府为执行朝鲜劳动党的经济政策而采取的各项正确政策的结果，是全体劳动人民为贯彻这些政策的斗争中钢铁般地团结在党和政府的周围，发挥了一切创造性和忘我的爱国主义精神的结果。

    他说，第一个五年计划的完成又一次证明党的政策的正确性，只要人民团结起来进行斗争就没有完成不了的任务。即将在明年开始的七年计划将进一步加强我们在党的周围的团结。有百战百胜的党，有强大的重工业，有完成第一个五年计划的经验，有了千里马运动，我们就能够胜利再胜利。
    国家计划委员会委员长林桂哲在发言中说，第一个五年计划在朝鲜打开了千里马时代。朝鲜人民用节约一分一文钱的精神迅速建起了机械工业基础，并且在短时间内培养出了大批民族干部管理三千多个工厂。全国工农业总产值的飞快增长，这只能在劳动党领导下的时代才能取得。
    财政相韩相斗在报告了国家收入增多、税收减少等良好情况后说，党千方百计地增产节约、挖掘潜力，大大提高了工农业生产水平。劳动人民响应党的号召，不用国家投资还建设了一千多个地方工业工厂。但是，我们不能满足现有的水平要继续胜利进行七年计划。
