Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 3rd: Cuban Minister of Public Works, Osmani Cienfuegos, was appointed today as Chairman of the National Urban Reform Supreme Council. This committee will be responsible for implementing the Urban Reform Law passed by the cabinet in mid-October.

    The Urban Reform Law stipulates that everyone has the right to housing. Renters become homeowners after paying off the house price in installments. The vast majority of cities across the country are currently implementing this law. In the capital, every window of the various offices of the Ministry of Public Works is crowded with people applying to purchase homes through installment payments. At the same time, from early morning every day, thousands of people go to the General Post Office Savings to pay what they used to pay monthly as rent, but now pay as installments on the house price. Renters who are about to become homeowners are happily painting and decorating their homes.

    The Urban Reform Law has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of working people who have suffered from landlord exploitation in the past. A clerk at a café on 23rd Street in Havana said that the eight clerks at the café are all renters and will become owners of their homes within five years. Santiago news vendor Torre Castillo said, "Now my wife, my five children, and I don't have to be afraid of being thrown out into the street one day."

    Approximately 60% of families in the capital rent houses from others. One big landlord, Sara, alone owns 12,000 rooms in apartments in Havana. Before the revolution, rent accounted for more than 30% of the income of ordinary workers. Although the government passed a law reducing rents by 50%, the big landlords who owned apartments continued to exploit the broad masses of working people and the middle class who did not own homes. Matanzas is a city with a population of 20,000 households. In the past, less than 4,000 households owned homes. The Urban Reform Law will make more than 15,000 households new homeowners.

    人人都享有住房的权利
    古巴实施城市改革法
    租房者分期偿付房价后即成为房屋主人
    新华社哈瓦那3日电　古巴政府公共工程部长奥斯马尼·西恩富戈斯今天被任命为全国城市改革最高委员会主席，这个委员会将负责执行内阁在10月中旬通过的城市改革法。
    城市改革法规定人人都有住房的权利。租房者在分期偿付房价后即成为房屋的主人。目前全国绝大多数城市已在实施这项法律。在首都，公共工程部各处办公室的每个窗口，挤满了申请以分期付款的方式购置房屋的人群。同时，每天从一清早起就有数以千计的人到邮政储蓄总所交纳他们过去每月作为房租、而现在作为房价分期付款的款项。将成为主人的租房者怀着欢乐的心情正在粉刷和装饰房屋。
    城市改革法受到过去遭受房东剥削的广大劳动人民的热烈欢迎。哈瓦那第二十三号街上的一个咖啡馆的店员说，这家咖啡馆的八个店员都是租房子住的，他们将在五年内成为他们住房的主人。圣地亚哥卖报人托雷·卡斯蒂略说，现在我和我的老婆以及五个孩子可以不用害怕有一天会把我们赶到街上了。
    首都约有60％的家庭租别人的房屋居住。仅仅一个大房东萨拉在哈瓦那拥有的公寓就有一万二千套房间。在革命胜利前，房租占一般劳动者收入的30％以上。虽然政府通过了降低房租50％的法律，但是拥有公寓的大房东仍然继续剥削没有房屋的广大劳动人民和中等阶层。马坦萨斯是一个拥有二万户人口的城市，过去居民拥有房屋的不到四千户，城市改革法将使一万五千多户成为新的房主。（附图片）
