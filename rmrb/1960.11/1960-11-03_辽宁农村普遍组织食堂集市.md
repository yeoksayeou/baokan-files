Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 2nd: Rural commercial departments in Liaoning Province are universally promoting the experience of Changtu County in organizing canteen markets.

The advantages are: First, on-the-spot organization of services saves agricultural labor; Second, it is beneficial for both production teams and commune members to better arrange production and life, and it can also improve the planning of purchasing and marketing work and expand purchasing and marketing business; Third, it facilitates strengthening market management and improving the level of commercial work; Fourth, it creates favorable conditions for establishing a new commodity distribution system.

Canteen market is a new type of rural market, which is that the supply and marketing cooperative adopts the method of fixed point, fixed time, and fixed personnel, and plans to go to the public canteen of the production team to carry out purchasing, marketing and various service activities on the spot during the rest time of the commune members after meals.

Since the realization of people's communes in rural areas, a new atmosphere has emerged of everyone being busy with production and every household having no idle people. In order to facilitate the masses, Liaoning commercial departments have taken measures such as delivering goods to the door, which has played a great role in supporting production. However, due to the uncertain time and the small variety of goods carried, the needs of commune members cannot be fully met, and sometimes commune members have to go to the market and enter the city to buy some small farm tools. In the aspect of purchasing agricultural and sideline products, due to the lack of fixed time and place, large transactions cannot be made. Changtu County's organization of canteen markets complements the shortcomings of agency purchase and sale and mobile services, and effectively solves this contradiction. Since the universal promotion of this kind of canteen market, it has gradually developed from purchasing and selling to comprehensive and diversified services through continuous enrichment. The canteen market held by Changxing Supply and Marketing Store in Beizhen County, in addition to doing a good job in supply and purchase, has successively added a variety of service projects such as repairing tools, repairing shoes, hairdressing, taking pictures, and acting as an agent for washing and dyeing, savings, and mailing, so that commune members can handle life matters without leaving the village and without taking up production time.

Through this stage of practice, the canteen market is very popular among production teams and commune members. Its advantages are: First, since production materials and living materials are delivered to the canteen regularly and at fixed points, and services are organized on the spot, it not only facilitates the masses, but also saves a lot of labor for agriculture. For example, Songzhangzi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Lingyuan County saved more than 200 working days for the production team in three times by organizing canteen markets. Second, the canteen market transforms some scattered transactions in rural areas into regular and centralized transactions, which not only facilitates production teams and commune members to better arrange production and life, but also improves the planning of purchasing and marketing work and expands purchasing and marketing business. For example, Changxing Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Beizhen County doubled the variety of purchases and sales within 20 days of starting to organize canteen markets. In the three months after Cilu Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Changtu County carried out the canteen market, it overfulfilled the purchase plan of local products and sideline products every month, and the purchase variety increased by 17 compared with the previous three months. Third, the canteen market allows state-owned commerce to meet directly with the vast number of commune members, which is convenient for strengthening market management, and also convenient for mass supervision and improving the level of commercial work. Fourth, through planned and organized supply arrangements, it not only has a significant effect on regulating supply and demand, but also creates favorable conditions for establishing a new commodity distribution system.

    辽宁农村普遍组织食堂集市
    它的好处是：一、就地组织服务，节省农业劳动力；二、既有利于生产队和社员更好的安排生产和生活，又可提高购销工作的计划性，扩大购销业务；三、便于加强市场管理，提高商业工作水平；四、为建立新的商品分配体系创造了有利条件
    新华社沈阳2日电　辽宁省各地农村商业部门，正在普遍推广昌图县组织食堂集市的经验。
    食堂集市是一种新型的农村集市，就是由供销社采取定点、定时、定人的办法，有计划地到生产小队公共食堂，利用社员饭后休息时间，就地开展购销和各项服务活动。
    农村实现人民公社化以来，出现了人人忙生产、户户无闲人的新气象。为了便利群众，辽宁商业部门曾采取送货到门等项措施，对支持生产起了很大作用。但是由于时间不定，携带货物品种较少，社员需要不能充分满足，有时社员要购一些小农具，还得赶集进城。在收购农副产品方面，也由于没有固定的时间和地点，不能大量成交。昌图县组织食堂集市，补充了代购代销和流动服务的不足，有效地解决了这个矛盾。这种食堂集市普遍推广以来，经过不断的充实，已由开始时只搞购销逐步发展为综合性的多种服务。北镇县常兴供销商店举办的食堂集市，除了做好供应和收购工作以外，还陆续增添了修工具、修鞋、理发、照像和代办洗染、储蓄、邮寄等多种服务项目，社员们不用出村，不用占生产时间，就能办好生活上的事情。
    通过这一阶段的实践，食堂集市很受生产队和社员的欢迎。它的好处是：第一，由于定期、定点将生产资料、生活资料送到食堂，就地组织服务，既便利了群众，又为农业节省了很多劳动力。如凌源县宋杖子供销社组织食堂集市，三次就使生产队节省二百多个劳动日。第二，食堂集市使农村一部分零星的分散的交易，转为定期的集中的交易，既有利于生产队和社员更好的安排生产和生活，又提高了购销工作的计划性，扩大了购销业务。如北镇县常兴供销社开始组织食堂集市的二十天内，就使购销品种扩大了一倍多。昌图县此路供销社开展食堂集市以后的三个月，月月都超额完成了土产品、副业产品收购计划，收购品种比前三个月增加了十七种。第三，食堂集市使国营商业与广大社员直接见面，便于加强市场管理，也便于群众监督，提高商业工作的水平。第四，通过有计划有组织的安排供应，不仅对调剂供求有着显著作用，还为建立新的商品分配体系创造了有利条件。
