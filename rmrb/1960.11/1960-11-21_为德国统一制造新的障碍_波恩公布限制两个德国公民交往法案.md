Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 19th. According to Tass, the West German government announced a new bill on the 17th, which would place contact between citizens of West Germany and the German Democratic Republic under police surveillance. This is another measure taken by the West German government, following its decision to halt inter-regional trade between West Germany and the German Democratic Republic, to restrict interactions between the two Germanys, thereby creating new obstacles to German reunification.

This bill has aroused dissatisfaction among the West German public. West German newspapers are buzzing today, pointing out that, according to this bill, the West German government even intends to prohibit hundreds of thousands of West German parents from sending their children to summer camps in the German Democratic Republic during the holidays.

The "Süddeutsche Zeitung" pointed out that this bill has already caused unease among some members of parliament. They pointed out that the bill violates the West German Basic Law.

The "Neue Rhein Zeitung" pointed out that the government's actions "are detrimental to the proposition of restoring unification."

The "Westfälische Rundschau" said that the government's bill may subject civil rights to "dangerous restrictions." The newspaper also warned that this is "a dangerous step towards a police state."

    为德国统一制造新的障碍
    波恩公布限制两个德国公民交往法案
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社波恩讯：西德政府17日公布了一项新法案，这个法案要把西德和德意志民主共和国的公民之间的接触置于警察监视之下。这是西德政府继停止西德同德意志民主共和国地区间贸易的决定之后采取的限制两个德国的交往从而为德国的统一制造新障碍的又一措施。
    这项法案激起了西德广大公众的不满。西德报纸今天议论纷纷，它们指出，根据这个法案，西德政府甚至打算禁止成千上万的西德家长在假期送自己的孩子到德意志民主共和国去进夏令营。
    “南德意志报”指出，这一法案已经引起一些议员的不安。他们指出，这个法案违背西德根本法。
    “新莱因报”指出，政府这种行动“有害于恢复统一的主张”。
  “威斯特伐利亚评论报”说，政府的法案可能使公民权受到“危险的限制”。报纸并且提出警告，认为这是“走向警察国家的危险的一步”。
