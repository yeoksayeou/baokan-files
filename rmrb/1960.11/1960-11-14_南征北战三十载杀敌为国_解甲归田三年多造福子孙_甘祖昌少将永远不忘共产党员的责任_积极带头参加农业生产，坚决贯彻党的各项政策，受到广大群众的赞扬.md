Having fought north and south for thirty years, killing enemies to serve the country, and retired to his hometown for more than three years to benefit his descendants, Major General Gan Zuchang never forgets the responsibilities of a Communist Party member. He actively takes the lead in participating in agricultural production, resolutely implements the Party's various policies, and is praised by the broad masses.

Communist Party member, veteran Red Army soldier, and Major General of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Gan Zuchang, fought north and south for the revolutionary cause of the Party and the people for thirty years. He suffered several head injuries and was ultimately unable to continue working due to severe brain damage. In 1957, he resolutely abandoned his convalescent life and returned to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

General Gan Zuchang was born in Qiaotou Village, Lianhua County, Jiangxi Province. He joined the Red Army in 1927 and served as the Director of the Logistics Department of the Xinjiang Military Region before returning to his hometown. Now, he has become a genuine farmer, living a very simple life.

Soon after joining the Red Army, Gan Zuchang set out with the troops to fight. Once, while fighting in You County, Hunan, he was wounded in the head. However, he bandaged it with herbal medicine for a few days and then threw himself back into battle. During the Long March, bullets were shot into the same wound on his forehead twice. He gritted his teeth, felt for the half of the bullet head that was exposed, and pulled it out. After throwing away the bullet head and bandaging the wound with cloth, he rushed forward again.

From that time on, he served as the Red Army's supply director. Often, when the troops stopped to rest, he would be busy with grain and grass. When the troops set off, he, as the person in charge of logistics, would be burdened with mules, horses, vehicles, grain, and fodder, carrying a heavy load and following the troops. Sometimes he couldn't even eat a meal all day, grabbing a few broad beans as a meal and still being able to run one hundred and twenty li.

In 1951, he suffered another serious head injury in a car accident, but he only rested for a few months before starting work again. However, because his brain had been severely damaged, he would faint after working for a few days. He would be sent to the hospital for recuperation, but after a few days, he would be carried back to the hospital. This continued for six or seven years. He often thought to himself, "The whole country is engaged in a vigorous construction effort. Should I just stay idle like this?" He was determined to participate in physical labor, which would both reduce the burden on the state and create wealth for society. Therefore, he submitted an application to the Party organization, requesting to return to the countryside to participate in physical labor. Considering his physical condition, the Party organization advised him to recuperate well. However, he repeatedly requested to return to the countryside to participate in labor, and finally in September 1957, the Party organization approved his return to his hometown for convalescence. From then on, he took his whole family back to his long-separated hometown – Qiaotou Village, Yanbei Brigade, Fanglou Commune, Lianhua County, Jiangxi Province.

As soon as Gan Zuchang set foot on the land of his hometown, he was determined, "As long as my heart can still beat, I will give my all to contribute to building a happy countryside." After arriving home, he personally cleaned the house and arranged the beds. Before dawn on the fourth day, he picked up a dustpan and picked up manure around the village. In these three months, he picked up more than 30,000 jin of manure and sent it all to the agricultural cooperative. He said, "My body is not good, I can't help the cooperative with anything, I'll pick up some manure to fulfill my obligations!"

After returning to his hometown, Gan Zuchang kept observing the surrounding red soil hills. These hills had been red for many years. A few years ago, some people had tried to develop these hills, but they had all failed. After a heavy rain, the mountain water would carry mud and sand down, washing everything away. When it was dry, the red soil would bake like a piece of copper, and it was impossible to dig. He thought: Times have changed, and these red soil hills should also be developed. Although there are many difficulties, if we work at it for a few years, there will always be benefits. So, he chose a graveyard behind his house and began experimenting with transforming the red soil.

This graveyard was full of old graves from hundreds of years ago, overgrown with thorns and weeds, with poisonous snakes inside. He believed that transforming red soil was like fighting a war, you had to take down the strongholds first to solve the overall problem smoothly. If this graveyard could be taken down, there would be a model for transforming other red soil hills. Could crops grow on red soil? Everyone in the village was worried. Some kind people came to advise him, "You're so old, why bother with this? Red soil can't grow anything." He did not waver. He firmly believed that the soil quality was not immutable. If you find a way to transform it, it will change. If you don't touch it, it will remain the same even after ten thousand years.

One day, he read an article in the newspaper by Liu Junxiu, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, about transforming red soil. He said repeatedly, "That's great, that's great, this is the basis." He carefully read the article five times. His idea was further confirmed: The main reason why red soil does not grow crops is that it lacks organic fertilizer. As long as enough organic fertilizer is applied, the soil quality will gradually change. In the past, although people had applied fertilizer, they lacked corresponding measures and did not achieve the desired results. For example, to prevent mountain water from washing away the sand and fertilizer, several drainage, water storage, and sand interception channels must be planned. To prevent drought, ditches should be dug deeper and plowing should be deeper, and so on. Therefore, on the one hand, he paid attention to deep plowing, and on the other hand, he dug more than a dozen crisscrossing drainage ditches, sand interception channels, and flood storage ditches. In addition to working himself, he also mobilized his children to help him cut grass for composting and apply large amounts of organic fertilizer to the land. After three years of hard work, he not only reclaimed more than four mu of land, but also planted fifteen kinds of fruit trees and various melons and vegetables on this land. Currently, the Shandong fruit trees have grown more than three chi tall, the grape vines have grown more than one zhang long, and pears, peaches, and citrus trees are growing very luxuriantly.

The success of Gan Zuchang's red soil transformation experiment encouraged the members of Yanbei Brigade. They said, "Comrade Gan's experimental field is a good example for us."

In these few years, Gan Zuchang insisted on participating in labor himself, living a simple life, and never forgetting the responsibilities of a Communist Party member. He is always concerned about the production of the commune. In 1958, when the Party proposed the call to transform low-yield fields, he actively responded. He said: I am a Communist Party member, without exception, I should become a pioneer in implementing the Party's policies. For this reason, he used the opportunity to pick up manure and cut cogon grass to walk all over the mountains and every field in the village, repeatedly observing and thinking carefully.

One day, he found the Party branch secretary, captain, and deputy captain of the brigade, and led them to a mountain in the northwest of the village, pointing to a piece of watery winter paddy field in front of the village and said: Look, this is our village's "heart disease." The Party calls on us to transform low-yield into high-yield. If we don't cure this large area of winter paddy field, it will be difficult to achieve.

Yanbei Brigade has nine teams and only more than 2,000 mu of land, of which winter paddy fields account for more than 600 mu. These fields are connected in front of the door, and the soil, sunshine, and water source conditions are very good. But it can only grow one season of late rice. Sometimes when the rain is heavy, the mud and sand from the mountains come down, and there are often poor harvests. He explained to the brigade cadres in detail his plan to transform the winter paddy fields. And he encouraged everyone: "Let's have a five-year plan, and these fields will be transformed." The leading comrades of the brigade agreed with his plan and said that they would start immediately. However, he said: "Now it is just a plan, and there is no practical experience as a basis. We must set an example." He asked the brigade to allocate him five mu of winter paddy fields for testing first, and then promote it when he was sure. The brigade Party branch fully agreed with his opinion and allocated him five mu of winter paddy fields for experimentation.

In the winter of 1958, he began to transform the winter paddy fields. These winter paddy fields, after harvesting one season of late rice every year, are filled with water and kept until the time of planting late rice in the second year. Because the fields are filled with water all year round, they are full of thin mud soup, and you can't reach the bottom when you step in. Some fields can't even be entered, and the masses call them "bottomless mud lakes." However, Gan Zuchang did not consider these. He led the masses, overcame various difficulties, and opened several new drainage ditches around the fields to release the water from the fields. After drying them in the sun, he sowed seeds. By the spring of 1959, the rapeseed grew more than one person tall, and both rapeseed and safflower had a bumper harvest. "Gan Zuchang's experiment was successful." The good news was passed on everywhere in the village. In the spring of 1959, he personally led the members of the seventh team to change sixty-four mu of winter paddy fields in a row. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the members to transform the winter paddy fields, he took out more than 1,000 yuan to buy more than 8,000 jin of fertilizer, and gave thirty jin to each mu of paddy field that had been transformed, providing support without compensation. Seeing that the seventh team had transformed the winter paddy fields, the eighth team also automatically changed more than 60 mu. This year, the 120 mu of winter paddy fields transformed by these two teams not only had a bumper harvest of overwintering crops, but also planted double-season rice, and the unit area yield generally increased by more than one time.

After returning to the countryside, Comrade Gan Zuchang worked with everyone to build his hometown in this way. Therefore, the masses love him, trust him, and regard him as their own relatives. Every year and festival, every household invites him to drink and eat, but he politely declines them one by one. He humbly said, "I haven't done anything for everyone, and I'm still far from the requirements of the Party."

    南征北战三十载杀敌为国　解甲归田三年多造福子孙
    甘祖昌少将永远不忘共产党员的责任
    积极带头参加农业生产，坚决贯彻党的各项政策，受到广大群众的赞扬
    共产党员、红军老战士、中国人民解放军少将甘祖昌，为党和人民的革命事业，南征北战三十年，头部数次负伤，终因脑子受到严重损害不能坚持工作。1957年，他毅然放弃了疗养生活，坚决地回到农村参加农业生产劳动。
    甘祖昌将军出生在江西省莲花县桥头村。1927年就参加了红军，回乡前担任新疆军区后勤部部长。现在，他成了道地的农民，过着十分俭朴的生活。
    甘祖昌参加红军不久，就随着队伍出发打仗。一次打湖南攸县，他头上负了伤，可是，他用草药包扎了几天又投入了战斗。在长征途中，两次在前额的同一伤口上被射进了子弹，他咬咬牙，摸了摸半截露在外面的子弹头，一下就拔出来。抛了弹头，用布包扎了一下伤口，又冲向前去。
    从那时起，他就担任了红军的供给主任。常常队伍驻下来休息了，他还是粮啦，草啦，忙个不停；队伍出发了，他这个管后勤工作的人，又是骡马车辆，又是粮食草料，担着沉重的担子跟着队伍跑。有时一天都吃不上饭，抓几粒蚕豆当一餐饭，还能跑一百二十里。
    1951年在一次汽车事故中，他的头部又一次受到了重伤，可是他只休养了几个月又开始工作了。但是，终因为脑子受到了严重损伤，干几天工作就昏厥过去。送进医院休养好了；过不了几天，又被抬进医院。就这样，持续了六、七年。他内心常这样想：“全国都在轰轰烈烈地建设，我就这样白白地呆着吗？”他下定决心，参加体力劳动，既可以减轻国家负担，又可以为社会创造财富。于是他向党组织提出了申请，要求回到农村参加体力劳动。党组织考虑到他的身体情况，劝他好好休养。但是，他再三地要求回到农村参加劳动，一直到1957年9月，党组织批准他回乡休养。从此，他带着全家老少回到久别的故乡——江西省莲花县坊楼公社沿背大队桥头村。
    甘祖昌一踏上故乡的土地，他就下定决心，“只要我的心脏还能跳动，我有一分热，发一分光，一定为建设一个幸福的农村贡献自己的力量。”到家后，他亲自动手打扫房屋，安置床铺。第四天天还没有亮，他就提起畚箕到村前村后拾粪。这一年的三个多月中，他拣了三万多斤粪，全部送给了农业社。他说，“我的身体不行，不能帮社里做什么事，拣点粪尽尽义务吧！”
    甘祖昌回家乡以后，就一直留心观察四周的红土山岗。这些山多年来都是红红的一片。几年前，也曾有人开发这些山岗，但是都失败了。一场大雨后，山水就夹着泥沙冲下来，什么都冲走了；天一旱，晒得红土像一块铜，刨都刨不动。他想：时代变了，这些红土山也应该出头露面了。虽说困难很多，但是干他个几年，总会有好处的。于是，他选了屋后一座乱坟山，搞起改造红壤土的试验来了。
    这座乱坟山上都是几百年以前的老坟堆，长满了荆棘、野草，草里边还有毒蛇。他认为，改造红壤土也像打仗一样，必得先攻掉堡垒，才能顺利地解决全局问题。如果能把这座乱坟山攻掉了，其它的红土山的改造也就有了一个样子。红壤土能不能长出庄稼来呢？全村的人都担心着。有些好心的人来劝他：“你这么大年纪了，何必费这个心思，操这个劳，红土上是长不出东西来的。”他没有动摇。他坚信：土质并不是一成不变的，你想办法改造它，它就会起变化；你不去动它，再过一万年，还是那个样子。
    一天，他从报纸上看到中共江西省委书记刘俊秀写的一篇关于改造红壤土的文章，他连连地说：“太好了，太好了，这就有根据了。”他仔细地把这篇文章看了五遍。他的想法得到了进一步的证实：红壤土不长庄稼的主要原因，是这种土质缺乏有机肥料，只要下足有机肥料，土质就会逐步发生变化。过去人们虽然下过肥，但缺乏相应的措施，没有收到应有效果。例如防止山水冲下流砂，冲走肥料，这就要有计划地开出几条排水、蓄水、拦砂的渠道；为了防旱，水沟要挖得深一点、要深耕等等。因此，他一方面注意深耕，同时又开出十几条纵横交错的排水沟、拦砂道、蓄洪沟。除了自己干以外，他还动员念书的几个孩子，帮着他割草沤肥，把大批的有机肥料下到地里。经过三年苦战，他不仅开出了四亩多地，还在这块地上种了十五种果树和各种瓜果蔬菜。目前，山东果树已长了三尺多高，葡萄树也发出了一丈多长的藤条，梨、桃、柑桔都长得十分茂盛。
    甘祖昌改造红壤土试验成功，鼓舞了沿背大队的社员们。他们说：“甘部长的试验田，就是我们的好榜样。”
    甘祖昌这几年自己坚持参加劳动，过着俭朴的生活，还一刻也没有忘记一个共产党员应尽的责任。他时刻关心着公社的生产。1958年，党提出改造低产田的号召，他就积极响应。他说：我是一个共产党员，毫无例外，应该成为贯彻党的政策的先锋。为此，他曾利用拣粪、割茅草的机会，走遍了村子的各个山头和每一块田垅，反复地仔细观察、思量。
    一天，他找到了大队的党支部书记、队长、副队长等领导干部，领着他们走到村子西北头一个山头上，指着村前那一片水汪汪的冬水田说：你们看，这就是咱村里的“心脏病”。党号召我们低产变高产，如果不治好这一大片冬水田，就很难实现。
    沿背大队有九个小队，不过二千多亩田，其中冬水田就占去了六百多亩。这些田都在门前连成一片，土质、阳光、水源条件都很好。但是只能种一季晚稻。有时雨水大了，山上的泥沙俱下，还常常歉收。他向大队的干部们详细地说明了自己改造冬水田的计划。并鼓励大家：“我们来它一个五年计划，这些田就改造过来了。”大队的领导同志都同意他的计划，表示立即就干起来。但是，他说：“现在只是一个计划，还没有实践的经验做依据，我们必须做出榜样来。”他要求大队划给他五亩冬水田，先来试验，有了把握再推广。大队党支部完全同意他的意见，给他划出五亩冬水田作试验。
    1958年冬，他就开始改造冬水田。这些冬水田，每年收了一季晚稻以后，就灌满水养起来，一直到第二年栽晚稻的时候才去动它。田里由于长年蓄水，尽是稀泥汤，踩进去够不着底，有些田连人都进不得，群众叫它是“无底的泥湖”。然而，甘祖昌却没有考虑这些。他带领群众，战胜了各种困难，沿着田的周围又新开了几条排水沟，把田里的水放出来，经过太阳晒干，然后撒种。到1959年春天，油菜长得一人多高，油菜、红花都获得了大丰收。“甘祖昌的试验成功了”。村子里到处传递着喜讯。1959年春天，他亲自带领第七小队的社员们，一连改了六十四亩冬水田。为了鼓励社员改造冬水田的积极性，他自己拿出了一千多元买了八千多斤肥田粉，凡是改了冬水田的水田，每亩发给三十斤，无代价的支援。第八小队看到第七小队改了冬水田，也自动地改了六十多亩。今年，这两个小队改造了的一百二十亩冬水田，不仅越冬作物获得丰收，并都种上了双季稻，单位面积产量普遍提高一倍以上。
    甘祖昌同志回到农村后，就是这样和大家一块建设自己的家乡。因此群众热爱他，相信他，把他当成自己的亲人。每逢年节，家家户户都请他吃酒吃饭，但他都一一谢绝了。他谦虚地说：“我没有为大家做什么，距离党的要求还很远。”
