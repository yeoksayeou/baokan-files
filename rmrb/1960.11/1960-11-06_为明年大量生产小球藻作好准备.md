    Prepare for Large-Scale Chlorella Production Next Year
    In recent months, thanks to the attention of Party and government organs at all levels, a mass movement to propagate chlorella has been widely launched, producing large quantities of chlorella to be used as a concentrated feed for pigs. According to incomplete statistics, Zhejiang Province alone has cultivated over 3,000 mu of cultivation area, producing over 60 million jin of concentrated chlorella liquid. More than 15,000 livestock farms across the province use chlorella to feed pigs, and some livestock farms have also dried and stored some chlorella powder. Various regions have also made new developments in chlorella cultivation methods and technical equipment. In addition to establishing cultivation ponds and using jars, basins, and urns for propagation, some places have also created experience in using natural ponds and fields for production. Hengxian County in Guangxi Province and other places use wild grass and leaves to ferment green manure, replacing human waste and urine as a culture solution; coastal areas have successfully experimented with replacing human waste and urine with 30% seawater as a culture solution. Some places use salt, sour vine, kapok bark, and other materials as flocculants instead of alum, and use plant ash to absorb moisture, shortening the drying process of the concentrated liquid. Some places have already explored a complete set of experience in the production and use of chlorella, greatly improving the yield and quality of chlorella.
    The development of chlorella production is quite rapid, and the achievements are significant. However, in a few places, the work is started and stopped intermittently. Why is this? Some people think of chlorella when feed is scarce; later, when they see that feed is not lacking, they forget about chlorella. In the editorials and articles on chlorella propagation published in June and July, we stated that the successful research and large-scale propagation of chlorella is a major event in further utilizing natural resources and extracting more wealth from nature. Chlorella production has the advantages of not competing with grain for land, high yield, rapid reproduction, low cost, good nutrition, convenient management, and labor saving, making it a good feed for livestock. Not only is large-scale production needed when feed is not sufficient, but even if there is more other feed in the future, chlorella production should not be ignored. Some places have begun to try using chlorella as food and medicine, indicating that the development prospects of chlorella are even broader.
    Now, as winter is approaching and the temperature is gradually decreasing, chlorella production is encountering new difficulties. Efforts should be made to ensure that chlorella safely survives the first winter after large-scale production and to gain experience in continuing chlorella production in winter. At the same time, chlorella has been produced on a large scale for more than half a year, and in order to carry out chlorella production on an even larger scale next year, it is necessary to seriously summarize the experience of the past six months. Therefore, the issue of finding ways to help chlorella survive the winter safely and the issue of summarizing the experience of chlorella production are two important issues for further developing chlorella production.
    According to analysis by scientific research institutions, the most suitable temperature for chlorella reproduction is 24 to 28 degrees Celsius. Reproduction stops above 35 degrees and below 10 degrees Celsius, leading to death. A few days ago, the temperature in the suburbs of Beijing dropped to around 12 degrees Celsius, and about half of the chlorella had stopped reproducing. The Sino-German Friendship Commune in the suburbs of Beijing has taken corresponding measures to actively overcome this difficulty. They adopted the method of greenhouse production, adding sheds to the chlorella cultivation ponds of eight pig farms, turning open-air production into indoor production; simple fire channels and fire walls were set up indoors to maintain the indoor temperature, and preparations were made to introduce the waste gas generated by the boiler of the pig farm's feed processing machine into the cultivation pond to maintain the water temperature; electric lights and calcium carbide lamps were also prepared to increase light and ensure the overwintering production of chlorella. Of course, this approach by the Sino-German Commune requires relatively good material conditions and cannot be done everywhere. The Sino-German Commune also feels that this approach is too costly, and they are preparing to use the vacant land and space in the greenhouse to set up hanging pots to plant vegetables and cultivate feed yeast, making fuller use of material resources and reducing the production cost of chlorella at the same time. However, as long as the masses are earnestly mobilized, relied upon, adapted to local conditions, and more methods are devised, many practical and effective measures can always be found. For example, Zhucheng County in Shandong Province adopts the method of sunning during the day and covering at night to maintain the water temperature. When the temperature drops to 2 degrees Celsius, chlorella can still be produced outdoors. They also tried using pots and jars for production, placing them indoors at night and in a sheltered and sunny place during the day, and the chlorella matured in ten days. Now, seven communes in the county have universally used large pots for production. Of course, this year is, after all, the first year of large-scale chlorella production. There is not much experience, and the preparation of material conditions is not sufficient. It is impossible to require all regions to maintain normal production in winter. Each region should make appropriate arrangements based on its specific circumstances. Regions with the conditions to continue production as usual should try their best to do so. Regions without the conditions or where the climate is too cold can have the county or commune set up greenhouses to maintain the algal species, so that large-scale production can be resumed immediately after the weather turns warmer.
    In the large-scale production of chlorella for more than half a year, many valuable experiences have been gained. All localities should seriously summarize them to facilitate the further development of this movement. What aspects should be paid attention to when summarizing experience? First of all, it is necessary to summarize the experience of relying on the masses, using indigenous methods, and combining scientific research institutions with mass movements. The activities of scientific research institutions are very important. Their activities, combined with the practice of thousands of masses, have created many indigenous methods suitable for different conditions in various places, which are good methods under the existing conditions. Without the active participation of the broad masses and without fully utilizing the wisdom and talents of the masses, this movement cannot be rapidly carried out. Secondly, it is necessary to summarize the experience of being consistent, overcoming difficulties, and persevering to the end. Large-scale propagation of chlorella is a new task, and it is impossible not to encounter various difficulties. Is it possible to advance through difficulties and achieve victory? Or will you retreat when encountering difficulties and give up halfway? What different results have been achieved with different attitudes? Reviewing the path taken will increase confidence and methods. For example, the experience of the Sandun Commune in the suburbs of Hangzhou, which explored the emphasis on water (water depth of 40 to 50 centimeters), seeds (using specially cultivated seeds and planting appropriately), fertilizer (applying fertilizer appropriately and rationally matching), and harvesting (timely harvesting), and simultaneously promoting ponds (building good cultivation ponds), protection (preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests), tools (tool reform), and management (production management), is very worthy of attention. Similar experiences may not be fully mature, but on this basis, constantly summarize, improve, and develop, and it will not take long to create mature and systematic experiences. All regions should prepare for larger-scale chlorella propagation next year on the basis of summarizing experience, including technical preparation and material preparation. At present, the first thing is to solve the problem of chlorella overwintering. Efforts should be made to continue production in areas that can continue to produce in winter. In areas where normal production cannot be achieved, simply preserving the algal species will prepare the most important conditions for large-scale propagation next year, so that the production of chlorella can be guaranteed to be more active on a larger scale when the spring flowers bloom next year.

### 为明年大量生产小球藻作好准备

    为明年大量生产小球藻作好准备
    在最近几个月中，由于各地党政机关的重视，群众性繁殖小球藻的运动已经普遍展开，生产了大量小球藻，作为猪的精饲料。据不完全的统计，浙江一省就开辟了三千多亩的培养面积，生产小球藻浓缩液六千多万斤。全省有一万五千多个畜牧场用小球藻喂猪，有些畜牧场还晒干储存了一部分小球藻粉。各个地区在小球藻的培养方法和技术设备方面，也有了新的发展。除了建立培养池并且利用缸盆瓮罐繁殖以外，有的地方还创造了利用天然池塘和大田生产的经验。广西横县等地用野草、树叶沤制绿肥，代替人粪尿做培养液；沿海地区试验以30％的海水代替人粪尿作培养液，都已成功。有些地方用食盐、酸果藤、木棉皮等做沉淀剂代替明矾，用草木灰吸收水分，缩短了浓缩液的晒干过程。有的地方已经摸索出了生产、使用小球藻的成套经验，大大提高了小球藻的产量和质量。
    小球藻生产的发展是相当快的，成绩是很大的。但是，也有少数地方，搞搞停停，断断续续。为什么呢？有些人在饲料缺乏的时候，想到小球藻；以后看到饲料不缺了，就把小球藻忘记了。我们在六、七月间发表的关于繁殖小球藻的社论和文章里说过：小球藻的研究成功和大量繁殖，是进一步利用自然资源、向大自然索取更多财富的一件大事。小球藻的生产具有不与粮食争地、产量高、繁殖快、成本低、营养好、管理方便、节省劳力等优点，是牲畜的好饲料。不仅在饲料不够充裕的时候需要大量生产，即使将来别的饲料多了，也不应当忽视小球藻的生产。有的地方开始试用小球藻作为食品和药物，说明小球藻的发展前途是更加远大了。
    现在，冬季即将到来，气温日渐下降，小球藻生产遇到了新的困难，应当设法保证小球藻安全地渡过大量生产后的第一个冬天，并且取得冬季继续生产小球藻的经验。同时，小球藻大规模生产已经半年多了，为了明年更大规模地开展小球藻的生产，必须认真地总结半年来的经验。因而想办法使小球藻安全过冬的问题和总结小球藻生产经验的问题，就是进一步发展小球藻生产的两个重要的问题。
    根据科学研究机关分析，小球藻繁殖的最适宜温度是摄氏二十四度到二十八度，三十五度以上和十度以下停止繁殖，以至死亡。前几天，北京郊区气温降到十二度左右，有一半左右的小球藻已停止繁殖。北京市郊中德友谊公社采取了相应的措施，积极克服这种困难。他们采用温室生产的办法，把八个猪场的小球藻培养池加上罩棚，变露天生产为室内生产；在室内设置简易火道和火墙，保持室温，还准备把猪场加工饲料的锅驼机产生的废气通入培养池，保持水温；还准备了电灯和电石灯，增加光照，保证小球藻的越冬生产。当然，中德公社这种做法，要有比较好的物质条件，不是任何地方都能办到的。中德公社也感到这种作法成本太高，他们准备利用温室中的空地和空间，设置吊盆，种植蔬菜，培养饲料酵母，更充分地利用物质资源，同时降低小球藻的生产成本。但是，只要认真发动群众，依靠群众，因地制宜，多想办法，总能够找到很多切实有效的措施。比如，山东诸城县采用白天晒、晚上盖的办法保持水温，在气温降到摄氏二度的时候，小球藻仍能在室外生产。他们又试用盆罐生产，晚上放在室内，白天放在背风朝阳的地方，小球藻十天就能成熟。现在全县已有七个公社普遍使用大盆生产。当然，今年毕竟是第一年大规模生产小球藻，经验不多，物质条件准备不够，不可能要求所有地区都在冬季继续保持正常的生产。各个地区应当根据具体情况，妥善地加以安排，有条件照常生产的地方尽量做到照常生产，条件不具备或者气候太冷的地方，可以由县或公社设置温棚，保持藻种，以便天气转暖以后，立即恢复大面积生产。
    半年多来在小球藻的大规模生产中，已经取得了很多宝贵的经验，各地应当认真加以总结，以利于这个运动的进一步开展。在总结经验的时候，应该注意哪些方面呢？首先要总结依靠群众、土法上马、科学研究机关和群众运动相结合的经验。科学研究机关的活动是很重要的，他们的活动跟千千万万群众的实践结合起来，创造了许多适合各地不同情况的土办法，也就是在现有条件下的好办法。如果没有广大群众的积极参加，不充分发挥群众的聪明才智，这个运动是不能迅速开展起来的。其次，要总结始终如一、克服困难、坚持到底的经验。大量繁殖小球藻，是一项新的工作，不可能不遇到各种各样的困难。是逆难而进取得胜利呢？还是遇难即退半途而废呢？不同的态度取得了什么不同的结果呢？把走过的道路加以回顾，是会增加信心和办法的。例如，杭州市郊三墩公社摸索出的以水（水深四十至五十厘米）、种（用专门培养的种子，并且适量下种）、肥（适量施肥，合理搭配）、采（适时采收）为重点，池（修好培养池）、保（防治病虫害）、工（工具改革）、管（生产管理）同时并举的经验，就很值得注意。类似的经验可能是不完全成熟的，但是在这个基础上不断加以总结、提高和发展，不要多久，总可以创造出成熟的系统的经验来。各个地区应该在总结经验的基础上，为明年更大规模繁殖小球藻作好准备，包括技术的准备和物质的准备。而在当前，首先要解决小球藻的过冬问题。在冬季能够继续生产的要努力坚持生产，不能正常生产的地区，只要把藻种保存起来，就为明年大规模繁殖准备了最重要的条件，到明年春暖花开时候，就能保证小球藻的生产能够更大规模立刻活跃起来。
