Xinhua News Agency report: The Nonghong Production Team of the Luo Hui Brigade in the Shuikou Commune of Longjin County, Guangxi, adopted measures such as assigning work according to individual abilities, working according to the time, combining specialized and concurrent tasks, setting reasonable quotas, and settling work points daily during the autumn harvest and winter planting. These measures fully utilized the strengths and labor potential of each laborer, accelerating the progress of the autumn harvest and winter planting.

The Nonghong team has more paddy fields and less dry land. Before the busy autumn harvest, it only completed about 10% of its winter planting plan. Most of the winter planting tasks had to wait until the land was cleared after the autumn harvest to be carried out vigorously. Thus, there were more than 630 mu of harvesting and planting tasks to be completed before the Minor Snow solar term, with each of the team's forty-two full and semi-laborers having to shoulder more than fifteen mu. Team leader Xie Guohua and the team cadres analyzed the current situation, believing that to complete the harvesting and planting tasks on time and according to quality in the shortest possible time, labor must be arranged scientifically. Therefore, they took stock of the team's labor force and organized discussions among the masses on how to arrange it most scientifically and reasonably. In the discussion, some young commune members advocated "soldier against soldier" and "general against general," separating the strong and weak labor forces into work groups. However, most commune members disagreed with this approach. Commune member Tang Zhengxin said, "The work in the same field has its lighter and heavier aspects. Young people have great strength, so plowing and carrying loads are certainly good, but doing work such as sowing and drying grain would be a waste of labor. It is better to combine the strong and the weak, which is more beneficial to production." Work group leader Tang Zhengming said, "When dividing work groups, the combination of strong and weak labor forces must be well-matched. We also need to assign work according to each person's technical expertise to truly give play to everyone's role." Through presenting the situation and democratic discussion, the production team decided to adopt the method of assigning work according to individual abilities to seize the harvest and planting opportunities. The team took stock of each of the forty-two laborers in the team, and found that twenty-seven were strong laborers who basically knew how to do all kinds of farm work, but comparatively speaking, there were still differences in technical level. Among the twenty-seven, nine were most skilled in the three major farm works of plowing, harrowing, and threshing; eight young commune members were physically strong, but not skilled enough in plowing and harrowing, so they were best at transporting grain and fertilizer; and ten women were very experienced in harvesting and sowing. In addition, based on the situation of fifteen weak, elderly, and other semi-laborers, two were harvesting veterans, one knew how to grow vegetables, and two elderly people knew how to weave baskets, manure baskets, and twist cow ropes. The remaining semi-laborers could do some labor within their capabilities, such as drying grain, cutting sweet potato seedlings, and accumulating fertilizer. After the labor force was ranked, the team formed four work groups for harvesting, threshing, plowing, harrowing, and sowing, based on the individual strengths, with two sets of people for harvesting and planting, carrying out both at the same time.

On the basis of assigning work according to individual abilities and reasonably arranging the labor force, this team also paid attention to seizing the opportune moment, working according to the time, and using labor at critical points. For example, during harvesting, when the dew was not yet dry in the morning, and it was not easy to thresh the grain, they launched a shock harvest. When the sun was hot at noon, and the grain was easy to thresh, they launched a shock threshing. In terms of plowing and harrowing fields, they plowed sandy soil fields while harvesting to avoid the time being too long, the soil drying out, the soil becoming hard, and it taking more effort to plow, slowing down progress. It was most labor-saving, time-saving, and effort-saving to wait one or two days after harvesting clay and muddy soil before plowing. Because of the careful arrangement of labor according to individual abilities and time, the progress of harvesting and planting was greatly accelerated.

During the autumn harvest and winter planting, there were many carrying tasks. In order to transport in a timely manner, this team organized specialized labor to transport, and also organized incidental transportation. For example, they incidentally carried fertilizer and grain when going to and from work, and they also incidentally carried when delivering meals to the fields. The team recorded work points for all incidental transportation according to labor. In this way, the efficiency of transportation was greatly improved. On the basis of incidental transportation, it further developed into incidental labor. For example, when rushing to plant sweet potatoes, the breeder arranged the time for cutting pig feed and incidentally cut sweet potato seedlings for planting. As a result, the seedlings needed for more than 70 mu were all contracted by two breeders.

After the labor force was rationally arranged, this team conscientiously promoted the system of labor quotas and small-scale contracting, further mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of the masses. According to the requirements of harvesting and planting, the team made a long-term plan every ten days and a short-term arrangement every five days, allocating tasks to the groups. The work points of commune members were recorded and cleared every day. (Attached picture)

### 发动社员共同安排劳力  弄哄生产小队因人排工因时干活收种进度加快

    发动社员共同安排劳力
    弄哄生产小队因人排工因时干活收种进度加快
    据新华社讯　广西龙津县水口公社罗回大队弄哄生产小队，在秋收冬种中，采取因人排工、因时干活、专兼结合、合理定额、工分每天清结等办法，充分发挥了每个劳动力的特长和劳动潜力，加快了秋收、冬种进度。
    弄哄小队水田多、旱地少，在秋收大忙前只完成了冬种计划10％左右，大部分冬种任务要等到秋收以后腾出土地才能大力进行。这样，在小雪以前要完成的收种任务就有六百三十多亩，全队四十二个全、半劳动力每人要担负十五亩多。小队长谢国华和小队干部对当前的情况进行了分析，认为要在最短时间内，按量按质完成收种任务，必须科学地安排劳力。于是，他们对全队劳动力进行了摸底，并且组织群众讨论，如何安排才算最科学最合理。在讨论中，有的青年社员主张“兵对兵”“将对将”，把劳动力强的和弱的分开编作业组。但大多数社员不同意这样做法。社员汤正新说：“同一块田里的工夫有轻有重，年青力气大，犁田、挑担固然好，但干撒种、晒谷等活就浪费了劳动力，不如强弱搭配，对生产才更有利。”作业组长汤正明说：“划分作业组，劳动力强弱固然要搭配好，还要根据各人的技术特长来分工，才能真正的发挥每个人的作用。”通过摆情况和民主讨论，生产队决定采取因人排工的办法进行抢收抢种。小队把全队四十二个劳力逐一摸底排队，发现二十七个强劳动力，各种农活基本上都会做，但比较起来，技术水平仍有高低差别。二十七人中，有九人对犁田、耙田、打谷三大农活最拿手；有八个年青社员体力较强，犁耙技术不够高，运谷、运肥最好；有十个妇女对收割、撒种很有经验。另外，根据十五个体弱、年老和其他半劳动力情况排队，有两人是收割老手，一人会种菜，两个老人会编箩筐、粪箕和搓牛绳。余下的半劳动力还可以做一些晒谷、切薯苗和积肥等力所能及的劳动。劳动力排队以后，小队就根据各人的特长，分别组成收打、犁耙、播种、运输等四个作业小组，分收、种两套人马，边收边种。
    在因人排工、合理安排劳动力的基础上，这个小队又注意抓住火候，因时干活，把工夫用在节骨眼上。如在收割中，早上露水未干，打谷不易脱粒，他们就突击抢割。中午太阳毒，打谷容易脱粒，他们就突击打谷。在犁耙田方面，对沙质土的田，就边收边犁，以免时间隔得久了，晒干了田土，土质坚硬犁起来花工多，进度慢。对粘土、烂泥土收后稍等一两天才犁最能省工省时省力。由于做好因人因时排工，收种的进度大大加快了。
    在秋收冬种期间，挑运的活路很多，这个小队为了及时挑运，除组织好专门劳动力挑运外，还组织捎带运输。例如出工收工就捎带挑运肥料、粮食，送饭到田头，回去时也捎带挑运。捎带挑运的，小队一律按劳记工分。这样，挑运的效率也大大提高了。在捎带运输的基础上，进一步发展为捎带劳动。如在抢种红薯时，饲养员安排好切猪菜时间，顺便切红薯苗种，结果七十多亩所需的薯苗种全部由两个饲养员包干完成。
    劳动力合理安排以后，这个小队又认真推行劳动定额和小包工的制度，进一步调动群众的劳动积极性。小队根据收种要求，每十天做一次长计划，五天作一次短安排，将任务分配到小组。社员劳动工分，每天一记，每天一清。（附图片）
