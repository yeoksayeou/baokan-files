    The crimes of the American aggressors are too numerous to record
    Another large number of corpses of people massacred by the U.S. military discovered in Linshan County, Korea
    Xinhua News Agency, Sariwon, 14th. According to the Korean Central News Agency, more than 550 corpses of people brutally murdered by the U.S. imperialist executioners have recently been discovered in Linshan County, North Hwanghae Province.
    These corpses were unearthed in Xiangyan Village, Lianfeng Village, Jichun Village, Pinghe Village and other villages in Linshan County. Earlier, many corpses of innocent people had been unearthed in this area. The bodies and belongings of these victims once again reveal the heinous crimes committed by the U.S. imperialists when they occupied northern Korea ten years ago.
    Many victims had their skulls smashed to pieces, their wrists were chained, and some had iron nails driven into their foreheads. Many of the victims were women, children, and the elderly.
    A funeral was held for these victims in Linshan County on the 13th.

    美国侵略者罪行罄竹难书
    朝鲜麟山郡又发现大批惨遭美军屠杀的尸体
    据新华社14日讯　据朝鲜中央通讯社沙里院讯：最近在黄海北道麟山郡又发现了惨遭美帝国主义刽子手杀害的五百五十余人的尸体。
    这些尸体是在麟山郡象岩里、连丰里、基春里、平和里和其它村庄里挖出来的。早些时候，在这个地区已经挖出过许多无辜人民的尸体。这些受害者的尸体和遗物再次揭露了十年前美帝国主义者侵占朝鲜北部时所犯下的令人发指的罪行。
    许多受害者的头盖被击成碎片，手腕上锁着链条，有些人的前额被钉入了铁钉。受害者中有很多是妇女、儿童和老人。
    13日在麟山郡为这些牺牲者举行了葬仪。
