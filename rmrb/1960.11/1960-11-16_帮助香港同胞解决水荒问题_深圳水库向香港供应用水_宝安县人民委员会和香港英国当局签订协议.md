Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, November 15th. The People's Committee of Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, and the British authorities in Hong Kong have reached an agreement on the issue of Shenzhen Reservoir supplying water to Hong Kong. A signing ceremony was held in Shenzhen on the morning of the 15th, where Cao Ruoming, representative of the Bao'an County People's Committee, and Mr. Barty, representative of the British authorities in Hong Kong, signed the agreement and joint communiqué of the talks, respectively. According to the agreement, Shenzhen Reservoir will supply approximately 5 billion gallons of water to Hong Kong annually. Shenzhen Reservoir was basically completed this spring and will begin supplying water as soon as the water transmission projects of both parties are completed.

Hong Kong has long suffered from a severe water shortage. Every dry season, water is only supplied for three to four hours a day, seriously affecting the normal life of local compatriots and residents. Out of concern for their Hong Kong compatriots, the people of Guangdong Province have decided that after the completion of the Shenzhen Reservoir, in addition to meeting the needs of flood control and power generation, water can be diverted to supply Hong Kong compatriots if needed, helping Hong Kong compatriots solve part of the water shortage problem.

After the signing ceremony, the representatives of both parties visited the Shenzhen Reservoir.

In the afternoon, the Bao'an County People's Committee hosted a banquet to entertain all the representatives of the British authorities in Hong Kong who attended the signing ceremony. Those invited to the banquet included Liang Weilin, Director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, Gao Zhuoxiong, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Chen Yaocai, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, He Xian, Chairman of the Macau Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and well-known figures from Hong Kong and Macau, including Chen Pishi, Ma Wanqi, Wu Dizhou, Fei Yimin, and Wu Chufan.
