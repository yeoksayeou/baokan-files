Everyone Pitches In to Transport and Store Autumn Vegetables
By Our Reporter

    The people of Beijing spent a fighting Sunday on the 6th!

    At the crack of dawn, the Communist Youth League shock brigade of the Jing Shan People's Commune in the city marched in formation towards the Tai Yang Gong brigade of the He Ping People's Commune in the northern suburbs to rush-harvest Chinese cabbage. Seventy-three of the seventy-five members of the shock brigade were former housewives. In their own words, this was a group of city dwellers who had only eaten Chinese cabbage, but had never planted or harvested it.

    In the fields, the entire team was divided into five groups, like a 10,000-meter race on the track. In a large field of green vegetables, everyone competed to see who could chop the best and harvest the cleanest. On the competition field, they chased each other, not giving way.

    In this way, the Communist Youth League shock brigade spent only one and a half hours harvesting eighteen mu of Chinese cabbage cleanly.

    On the 7th, on the road leading to the western suburbs, people transporting vegetables by bicycle formed groups, constantly traveling back and forth. They were not professional transport workers; they were employees of the Beijing Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau.

    On this day, more than a hundred staff members of this organization who could ride bicycles went to the Xia Cun vegetable fields in the western suburbs to rush-transport autumn vegetables. Deputy Director He Hong, who rarely used a bicycle to carry things, also participated in the bicycle transportation team today. The Xia Cun vegetable fields in the western suburbs were nearly thirty li from the Beijing Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau. At first, it took the employees half a day to transport a load, including loading and unloading. Later, they adopted a流水作业 (lit. 'flowing water operational method', a term for assembly line) method of loading, transporting, and unloading, and they could transport a load in two hours.

    On this day, more than one hundred staff members of the bureau transported back 20,000 jin of vegetables by bicycle.

    At a little after 11:00 a.m., two large trucks of Chinese cabbage suddenly arrived at the Gan Yu Hu Tong vegetable distribution station of the Jianguomen People's Commune. Yi Zeng, who was responsible for unloading and distributing the vegetables, and the store manager, immediately called the street service station for help unloading the trucks.

    In the blink of an eye, seventy or eighty people gathered at the vegetable distribution station, including officers, cadres, family members, and residents. Many "Young Pioneers" also came to participate in unloading the vegetables. Grandma Tang, who was seventy-six years old, while moving the vegetables, told everyone to handle them gently. In just over ten minutes, more than 10,000 jin of vegetables were unloaded.

    大家动手运贮秋菜
    本报记者
    六日，北京人民度过了一个战斗的星期天！
    天刚蒙蒙亮，城市的景山人民公社共青团突击队，列队向北郊和平人民公社太阳宫大队出发，去抢收白菜。七十五名突击队员中有七十三名是过去的家庭妇女。用她们自己的话来说，这是一群只吃过白菜，却没有种过白菜也没有收过白菜的城里人。
    在田头上，全队分成五个小组，像运动场上的万米竞赛那样，在一大片绿油油的菜田里，大家比赛谁砍得好，收得净。竞赛场上你追我赶，互不相让。
    就这样，这个共青团突击队只用了一个半小时，就把十八亩大白菜收得干干净净。
    七日，通往西郊的马路上，用自行车运菜的人，成群结队，往返不断。他们不是专业运输队员，他们是北京长途电讯局的职工。
    这天，这个机关一百多个会骑车的工作人员，用自行车到西郊下村菜田抢运秋菜。副局长何轰平常很少用自行车驮过东西，今天也参加了自行车运菜队。西郊下村菜田离北京长途电讯局近三十华里，开始，职工们连装带卸，半天才运一趟。后来采取装、运、卸流水作业法，两个小时就运一趟。
    这一天，这个局的一百多名工作人员用自行车运回了两万斤菜。
    上午十一点多钟，建国门人民公社干雨胡同分菜站，一下子来了两大汽车白菜。负责卸车分菜的义增和商店经理一看，急忙打电话给街道服务站求援卸车。
    转眼之间，分菜站聚集了七、八十人，其中有军官、干部、家属和居民，许多“红领巾”也赶来参加卸菜，七十六岁的唐大妈，一面搬菜，一面告诉大家轻搬轻放，十几分钟，一万多斤菜就卸完了。
