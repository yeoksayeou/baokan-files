Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 3rd: The Lao Fighting Forces Radio today broadcasted an interview with Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, by a reporter from the "Lao Patriotic Newspaper" regarding the situation in Laos. The full text is as follows:

    Question: Please tell us about the current situation regarding the US interventionist conspiracy and the conspiratorial activities of the Phoumi Nosavan group in our country.

    Answer: Since the coup led by Captain Kong Le in Vientiane on August 9th this year and the establishment of the Souvanna Phouma government, the struggle movement of our people for independence, peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and a unified country has greatly developed and achieved many victories. Compatriots of all ethnic groups across the country are forming a huge united force against the US imperialist policy of intervention and the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group. After declaring its adherence to a policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony, the Prince Phouma government is currently negotiating with the Lao Patriotic Front and has also established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The Phoumi Nosavan rebel group is increasingly isolated.

    However, is everything fine now? That is not the case. US imperialism, the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc, and the reactionary groups in Thailand and South Vietnam are currently seeking every means to continue their intervention in our country. They are intensifying their coercion of the Kingdom Government to abandon its policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony. In reality, the Kingdom Government has been forced to accept their blatant conditions for "aid." Currently, only a small portion of US "aid" is given to the Phouma government, while the majority of US "aid" in the form of dollars, guns, and planes is directly given to the Phoumi rebel group in Savannakhet, despite the fact that this rebel group is constantly clamoring against the government and is openly carrying out activities to split the country. Under the pressure of the United States, a section of reactionary military officers are conscripting troops and expanding their forces on a large scale, and are even allowing remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to enter the northern provinces, especially Phong Saly Province. Currently, they are conducting large-scale offensives and "sweeps" against the Lao Fighting Forces, persecuting the people, and are in fact stirring up civil war.

    US Assistant Secretary of State Parsons, formerly the US Ambassador to Laos, this extremely reactionary element once used the pressure of "aid" to overthrow the coalition government, support Phoumi to seize power, and create civil war among the Lao people. Currently, the US interventionists have again dispatched Parsons to realize their original conspiracy, using the name of "aiding" the Phouma government to undermine the policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony, and to overthrow the Phouma government when necessary. It would be truly naive if we did not see this clearly!

    All our compatriots must see through this vicious conspiracy. We must unite closely, expose the conspiracies of the United States and its lackeys, resolutely oppose them, and demand that the government more resolutely implement the declared genuine policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony, and smash the enemy's conspiracy to turn Laos into a new-style colony and military base of the United States.

    Question: Please tell us what genuine peaceful neutrality is.

    Answer: Genuine peaceful neutrality is to establish friendly relations with all countries that respect our sovereignty and independence on the principle of equality, regardless of their political and social systems, especially with neighboring countries.

    Genuine peaceful neutrality is to accept aid from countries in both camps that does not involve any military or political constraints, on the principle of safeguarding sovereignty and establishing an independent economy. Only by realizing such genuine peaceful neutrality can the independence and sovereignty of Laos be guaranteed. This is the realization of a foreign policy that conforms to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit.

    Currently, the Kingdom Government's declaration to follow the path of peaceful neutrality and its establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union are a step forward.

    However, has the policy of peaceful neutrality been fully realized? Obviously, it has not been fully realized.

    In reality, the Kingdom Government seems to only accept the "aid" of US imperialism, which comes with extremely dangerous conditions. The longer this situation lasts, the more conditions the pro-American reactionary groups will have to increase their anti-people forces, and the government will remain subordinate to the "checks" of the US State Department. How can this be called genuine peaceful neutrality?

    Currently, the Kingdom Government still maintains diplomatic relations with the South Vietnamese regime, while reactionary elements in South Vietnam continue to strengthen their aid to the Phoumi Nosavan group. However, it does not establish friendly relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is close to us and constantly expresses goodwill towards us. How can this be called genuine peaceful neutrality?

    Currently, the Kingdom Government still maintains diplomatic relations with the dictator Chiang Kai-shek, who was driven away by the Chinese people and is currently sending his remnants to the northern provinces of Laos to help the Phoumi Nosavan group. However, it does not establish friendly relations with the legitimate government of China, the People's Republic of China, which constantly expresses goodwill towards small and weak countries. How can this be called genuine peaceful neutrality?

    Recently, the Kingdom Government announced in principle its acceptance of Soviet aid, which is welcome, but the United States is currently using various pressures to obstruct it.

    We hope that the Prince Phouma government will emulate the genuine and resolute policy of peaceful neutrality implemented by India, Indonesia, Burma, and Cambodia, and free our country from its current subordination to US imperialism.

    Recently, some people have proposed a pro-Western policy of peaceful neutrality and opposed the Lao Fighting Forces, falsely accusing them of being pro-communist neutral. It is clear that so-called pro-Western is not peaceful neutrality. The so-called "neutral" arguments of people like Van Rathikone, who oppose the Lao Fighting Forces, are merely hiding the conspiracy to turn Laos into a US colony and military base and to stir up civil war under the guise of "neutrality." Our compatriots must not be deceived by them.

    Question: Please tell us about the purpose of the current negotiations between the Lao Patriotic Front and the Kingdom Government.

    Answer: The current urgent crisis facing our motherland and nation is that US imperialism is intensifying its intervention in Laos, instigating and supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group to split the country, expand the civil war, and exert pressure to force the Prince Phouma government to abandon its policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony. The primary task of our nation currently is to eliminate this crisis. Compatriots of all ethnic groups and all patriotic political parties should unite as a whole, strive hard, and demand that the government resolutely take the path of peaceful neutrality and national harmony, directing the spearhead of struggle at the common enemy of the nation. Therefore, the current negotiations between the Lao Patriotic Front and the Kingdom Government must seek all means to unite all forces that love the motherland and love peace, form a strong whole, and struggle for the Phouma government to implement a policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony, to unify the country, to oppose US imperialist intervention, and to defeat the forces of the Phoumi Nosavan group and any rebellious activities. It is precisely for this purpose that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, in its statement issued on October 17th this year, put forward a program including the following six points as the main content of the negotiations.

    The content of this six-point program is summarized as follows:

    1. Unite the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to oppose the intervention of the bellicose and aggressive forces of the United States and their lackeys, defend the motherland, religion, the king, and the constitution, and establish a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

    2. Establish a coalition government including representatives of all ethnic groups, all parties, and patriotic and peace-loving people, including representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Coup Committee, and the Committee for Supporting Peaceful Neutrality. Be lenient to those who have gone astray and have shown remorse, and give appropriate punishment to those who are stubborn.

    3. Implement genuine freedom and democratic rights for the people, release the cadres and soldiers of the Lao Patriotic Front and other patriotic people who have been illegally arrested, and then hold general elections based on the principles of free democracy, universal, direct, and secret ballot.

    4. Unify all patriotic armed forces on appropriate principles.

    5. Respect the Geneva Agreements, pursue a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality, and establish relations with all countries that respect Lao sovereignty on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit, first and foremost establishing friendly relations with neighboring countries. Accept aid from countries in both camps that are willing to help Laos and that does not involve any political or military constraints.

    6. Pay attention to developing the economy and culture, building transportation lines, developing education and health undertakings, encouraging and helping the people to increase production, and improving the material and spiritual life of the people of all ethnic groups.

    Only by realizing this program can we guarantee that the motherland will embark on the path of genuine peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and unification, and create conditions for establishing a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

    Question: Recently, foreign radio stations and Vientiane Radio have often talked about the issue of the Kingdom's regime in Sam Neua Province. What is your opinion on this issue?

    Answer: According to the Geneva Agreements, Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces are the assembly areas of the Lao Fighting Forces. In order to realize national harmony, national unity, and the implementation of the Vientiane Agreements, the Lao Fighting Forces have placed these two provinces under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom Government. But none of our people will forget that the lackeys of US imperialism at that time used the sincerity of the Lao Patriotic Front to overthrow the coalition government, support pro-American elements to come to power and usurp power, arrest the leaders and members of parliament of the Lao Patriotic Front, and implement a policy of terror and barbaric retaliation, launching a civil war in these two provinces and even throughout the country. After the Vientiane coup, in order to support the peaceful neutrality and national harmony policy of the Prince Phouma government, and with the help of Captain Kong Le, the people of Sam Neua Province, together with the armed forces of the Lao Patriotic Front, liberated Sam Neua Province from the rule of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group.

    However, US imperialism and the rebel group are still constantly hoping to reoccupy Sam Neua Province in order to strengthen their forces to oppose the government and undermine peaceful neutrality and national harmony.

    However, the Lao Patriotic Front and the people of Sam Neua Province have learned a painful lesson, and they will never allow that ugly drama of treachery under the guise of false harmony and unity to be repeated.

    Sam Neua Province is undoubtedly an inseparable part of the Kingdom's territory. The current regime in Sam Neua Province is a regime that conforms to the constitution, and it resolutely implements the Kingdom Government's policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony. Therefore, as long as the Kingdom Government has the sincerity to negotiate, gets rid of the pressure from US imperialism and its lackeys, establishes a broad coalition government, guarantees the people's freedom and democratic rights, the country embarks on the path of genuine peaceful neutrality, the forces of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group are smashed, and the US imperialist conspiracy of intervention is defeated, then national harmony and national unity will be realized.

    Question: Please tell us what the prospects are for the national situation.

    Answer: Looking back at the past period of time, the struggle of our people for peaceful neutrality and national harmony has achieved many victories. However, US imperialism and its lackeys are currently intensifying their intervention and sabotage. Due to their conspiracies and stubborn attitude, the struggle of our various ethnic groups for independence, peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and national unity will still encounter many difficulties.

    However, justice is entirely on our side. The united strength of our various ethnic groups is strengthening and moving towards victory. The patriotic tradition of our nation is being carried forward. The international situation is extremely favorable to the national liberation movements striving to break free from imperialist enslavement. Under these favorable basic conditions, the struggle of our nation and the policy of peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and national unity will surely achieve victory.

    Vientiane Radio recently reported that on October 31st, a "Committee for Striving for Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unity" including people from various ethnic groups, various strata, various parties, and patriotic people was established in the capital, and unanimously condemned the US imperialist policy of intervention and the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, unifying the current national salvation struggle line of our various ethnic groups. This is a new victory of great political significance.

    Taking this opportunity, I call on all parties, all groups, patriotic and peace-loving people, and compatriots of all ethnic groups and all strata throughout the country to unite closely, be vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies, and actively strive for the peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, unity, and prosperity of our motherland.

    I also hope that the Phouma government will recognize the conspiracy of the national enemy, fulfill the promises it has made to the people for the benefit of the motherland and the people, and thoroughly implement a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony in accordance with the wishes of the people of the whole country. On this just path, the Lao Patriotic Front will continue to sincerely provide support.

    苏发努冯就老挝局势答“老挝爱国报”记者问
    粉碎美帝国主义干涉阴谋是老挝民族首要任务
    实现爱国战线党六点纲领就能为建立和平中立独立民主统一繁荣的国家创造条件
    希望富马政府认清民族敌人阴谋按照人民愿望彻底执行和平中立和民族和睦政策
    新华社河内3日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播了老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯亲王就老挝局势答“老挝爱国报”记者问。全文如下：
    问：请您谈谈目前美国对我国的干涉阴谋和富米·诺萨万集团阴谋活动的情况。
    答：从今年8月9日以贡勒大尉为首在万象举行政变之后，梭发那·富马政府成立，我国人民争取独立、和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的斗争运动，有了很大的发展，并取得了许多胜利。全国各族同胞正在形成一个反对美帝国主义的干涉政策和富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的巨大团结力量。富马亲王政府在宣布遵循和平中立和民族和睦政策后，目前正在同老挝爱国战线党进行谈判，同时还同苏联建立了外交关系。富米·诺萨万叛乱集团日益被孤立。
    然而，目前一切事情是否都好了呢？不是这样。美帝国主义、东南亚军事侵略集团、泰国和越南南方的反动集团目前正在寻找一切办法，来继续干涉我国。它们正在加紧要挟王国政府放弃和平中立和民族和睦政策。实际上，王国政府已经被迫接受了它们的露骨的“援助”条件。目前，只有一小部分美国“援助”是交给富马政府，而大部分美国“援助”的美元、枪枝和飞机是直接交给沙湾拿吉的富米叛乱集团，尽管这个叛乱集团不断叫嚣反对政府，并且正在公然进行分裂国家的活动。一部分反动军官在美国的压力下，正在大肆抓兵，扩充部队，甚至正在让一些蒋介石集团残匪进入北方各省，尤其是丰沙里省。目前它们正在对寮国战斗部队进行大规模的进攻，“扫荡”，迫害人民，事实上它们正在掀起内战。
    美国助理国务卿帕森斯，以前是美国驻老挝的大使，这个反动透顶的分子曾经利用“援助”的压力，推翻了联合政府，扶持富米上台掌握政权，制造了老挝人之间的内战。目前，美国干涉者又派帕森斯来实现原来的阴谋，利用“援助”富马政府的名义来进行破坏和平中立和民族和睦政策，而一旦需要的话就推翻富马政府。这一点如果我们看不清楚，那才真正是天真呢！
    我们全国同胞都必须看清这一恶毒的阴谋。我们要紧紧地团结起来，揭穿美国及其走狗的阴谋，坚决反对它们，并要求政府更加坚决地执行所宣布的真正的和平中立和民族和睦政策，粉碎敌人企图把老挝变成美国的新式殖民地和军事基地的阴谋。
    问：请您谈谈真正的和平中立是怎样的？
    答：真正的和平中立是同一切按照平等原则尊重我们主权、独立的并不分政治和社会制度不同的国家，特别是各邻国，建立友好关系。
    真正的和平中立是在维护主权和建立自主的经济的原则下，接受两个阵营各国的、不附带任何军事和政治束缚条件的援助。只有实现这样的真正的和平中立，才能保障老挝的独立、主权。这就是实现一个符合于和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的外交政策。
    目前，王国政府宣布遵循和平中立道路，而且又同苏联建立了外交关系，这是一个进步。
    但是，和平中立政策是否已经充分地实现了呢？显然还没有充分实现。
    实际上，目前王国政府似乎只接受美帝国主义的带有极端危险条件的“援助”。这种情况延长一天，亲美的反动集团就还有条件来增加反人民的力量，政府就仍然附属于美国国务院的“支票”之下。这样怎能说是真正的和平中立呢？
    目前，在越南南方的反动分子不断对富米·诺萨万集团加强援助的情况下，王国政府仍保持同越南南方政权的外交关系，而对于接近我们的、不断对我们表示善意的越南民主共和国，却不建立友好关系，这怎能说是真正的和平中立呢？
    目前，王国政府仍同被中国人民赶跑的、而目前它们正派其残匪进入老挝北方几省帮助富米·诺萨万集团的独裁者蒋介石保持外交关系，而对不断对弱小国家表示善意的中国合法政府中华人民共和国，却不建立友好关系，这也怎能说是真正的和平中立呢？
    最近，王国政府宣布在原则上接受苏联的援助，这是值得欢迎的，但是目前美国正在使用各种压力加以阻挠。
    我们希望富马亲王政府要效法印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、柬埔寨各国所实现的真正的、坚决的和平中立政策，使我国摆脱目前附属于美帝国主义的状况。
    最近，有人提出了亲西方的和平中立政策，和反对寮国战斗部队、诬蔑寮国战斗部队是亲共的中立政策。很明显，所谓亲西方就不是什么和平中立。像万·拉迪功那样的所谓反对寮国战斗部队的“中立”论调，只不过是在“中立”两字的幌子下，隐藏着把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地、掀起内战的阴谋。我们同胞一定不要受他们的欺骗。
    问：请您谈一谈目前老挝爱国战线党同王国政府这次谈判的目的。
    答：我们祖国和民族当前的紧急危机是，美帝国主义正在加紧对老挝的干涉，并唆使和支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团分裂国家、扩大内战、施加压力，以迫使富马亲王政府放弃和平中立、民族和睦的政策。我们民族当前的首要任务就是消除这一危机。全国各族同胞、各爱国政党应团结成为一个整体，努力奋斗，要求政府坚决走和平中立和民族和睦的道路，把斗争的矛头指向民族的共同的敌人。所以，目前老挝爱国战线党同王国政府之间的谈判，必须寻求一切办法联合所有爱祖国、爱和平的力量，组成一个强固的整体，为要求富马政府执行和平中立、民族和睦的政策和统一国家，反对美帝国主义的干涉，击败富米·诺萨万集团的势力和任何叛乱活动而奋斗。正是为了这个目的，老挝爱国战线党中央在今年10月17日发表的声明中提出了包括下面六点的纲领作为谈判的主要内容。
    这个六点纲领的内容概括如下：
    一、团结全国各族人民，反对美国好战、侵略势力及其走狗的干涉，保卫祖国、宗教、国王和宪法，建立一个和平中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝。
    二、成立一个包括各民族、各党派和爱祖国、爱和平人士的代表参加的，其中有老挝爱国战线党、政变委员会、拥护和平中立政策委员会的代表参加的联合政府。对走上歧途而有所悔悟的人实行宽大，并对那些顽固分子给予适当的惩治。
    三、对人民实行真正的自由民主权利，释放被非法逮捕的老挝爱国战线党的干部和战士及其他爱国人士，进而根据自由民主、普遍、直接和秘密投票的原则举行普选。
    四、在适当的原则的基础上把所有的爱国武装力量统一起来。
    五、尊重日内瓦协议，奉行真正的和平中立政策，在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的基础上，同一切尊重老挝主权的国家建立关系，首先是同各邻国建立友好关系。接受两个阵营的愿意帮助老挝的各国的不附带任何政治和军事束缚条件的援助。
    六、注意发展经济和文化，修建交通运输线，发展教育和卫生事业，鼓励和帮助人民增加生产，改善各族人民的物质和精神生活。
    只有实现这个纲领，才能保证祖国走上真正的和平中立、民族和睦和统一的道路，为建立一个和平中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝创造条件。
    问：最近外国电台和万象电台时常谈到王国在桑怒省的政权问题，您对这一问题的意见怎样？
    答：根据日内瓦协议，桑怒和丰沙里两省是寮国战斗部队的集结地区。为了实现民族和睦、国家统一及执行万象协议，寮国战斗部队已把这两个省划归王国政府管辖。但我国人民谁也不会忘记，美帝国主义走狗在当时曾经利用老挝爱国战线党的诚意，推翻了联合政府，扶持亲美分子上台篡夺政权，逮捕老挝爱国战线党的领袖和议员，推行恐怖和野蛮报复的政策，在这两省以至全国发动内战。在万象政变之后，为了支持富马亲王政府的和平中立、民族和睦政策，并得到贡勒大尉的帮助，桑怒省人民已同老挝爱国战线党的武装力量一起把桑怒省从富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的统治下解放了出来。
    但是，美帝国主义和叛乱集团仍然时刻想望重新占领桑怒省，以加强力量来反对政府和破坏和平中立和民族和睦。
    然而，老挝爱国战线党和桑怒省人民已经吸取了沉痛的教训，他们决不让那种以虚假的和睦、统一为幌子的背信弃义的丑剧重演。
    桑怒省毫无疑问是王国领土不可分割的一部分。目前桑怒省的政权是符合宪法规定的政权，它坚决执行王国政府的和平中立、民族和睦政策。因此，只要王国政府有诚意进行谈判，摆脱美帝国主义及其走狗的压力，建立广泛的联合政府，保障人民的自由民主权利，国家走上真正和平中立的道路，富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的势力被粉碎，美帝国主义的干涉阴谋被击败，那么，民族和睦和国家的统一定将实现。
    问：请您谈谈国家局势的前景怎样？
    答：回顾过去一段时间，我国人民为和平中立和民族和睦而进行的斗争已经取得了许多胜利。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗目前正在加紧进行干涉和破坏，由于它们的阴谋和顽固态度，我国各民族为独立、和平中立、民族和睦、国家统一的斗争还将遇到许多困难。
    但是，正义完全在我们这一边。我国各民族的团结力量正在加强和走向胜利。我国民族的爱国传统日益发扬光大。国际形势对争取摆脱帝国主义的奴役的民族解放运动极其有利。在这种有利的基本条件下，我国民族的斗争和和平中立、民族和睦、统一国家的政策一定会取得胜利。
    万象电台最近报道，在10月31日，一个包括有各民族、各阶层、各政党和爱国人士参加的“争取和平中立民族和睦和统一国家委员会”已经在首都成立，并一致谴责美帝国主义的干涉政策和富米·诺萨万叛乱集团，统一了我国各民族目前的救国斗争路线，这是一个具有重大政治意义的新胜利。
    趁此机会，我呼吁全国各党派、各团体、爱祖国爱和平人士、各民族、各阶层同胞紧密地团结起来，对敌人的阴谋提高警惕，积极地为我们祖国的和平中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣而努力奋斗。
    我还希望富马政府认清民族敌人的阴谋，为了祖国和人民的利益，履行对人民所许下的诺言，按照全国人民的愿望，彻底地执行真正的和平中立和民族和睦政策。在这个正义的道路上，老挝爱国战线党不断地真诚地给予支持。
