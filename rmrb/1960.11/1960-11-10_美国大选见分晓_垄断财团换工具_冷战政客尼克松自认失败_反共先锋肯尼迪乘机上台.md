Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th November: The US election was held yesterday. According to preliminary results, Republican presidential candidate Nixon and vice-presidential candidate Lodge have definitively failed. Democratic candidates Kennedy and Johnson have been elected as the next US president and vice president, respectively, and will be inaugurated in January next year.

According to the preliminary results already released, Kennedy has secured 285 electoral votes, exceeding the 269 votes necessary for election by 16 votes (the total number of electoral votes is 537). Nixon has secured 170 electoral votes. This afternoon, Nixon issued a statement conceding defeat.

In the concurrent congressional elections, the Republican Party also suffered a defeat, and the Democratic Party will continue to hold the majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Preliminary results show that the Democratic Party has won 20 seats out of the 34 Senate seats up for re-election, and together with the Democratic seats not up for re-election, it now holds 63 seats, exceeding half of the total number of Senate seats (100). The Republican Party has won 13 new seats, bringing its total to 36 seats, including the 23 seats not up for re-election. Out of all 437 House of Representatives seats up for re-election, the Democratic Party is known to have won 249 seats, and the Republican Party has won 155 seats.

Nixon's and the Republican Party's defeat reflects the bankruptcy of the Eisenhower-Nixon government's foreign and domestic policies during its nearly eight years in power. In recent years, especially since 1957, when the international situation underwent a clear change with the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, the US government's aggressive and war-mongering policies have been constantly and severely frustrated and have been met with increasing opposition from the people of all countries. The events of sabotaging the summit conference, tearing off their mask of false peace, and being turned away by the Japanese people have brought the unpopularity of the Eisenhower-Nixon government to its peak. Domestically, with the approach of a new economic crisis, the rapid outflow of gold reserves, the increase in unemployment, and the decrease in farmers' income, the people's dissatisfaction has also been growing. A Reuters news item on the 9th stated that American voters "demanded a change."

Kennedy, who comes from the Kennedy family of Massachusetts, known as one of the twelve wealthiest families in the United States, has always been supported by the large monopoly conglomerates in the eastern United States. In his campaign, he vigorously used the failures of the Republican government's domestic and foreign policies to attack the Republican Party as a way to elevate himself. However, Kennedy's campaign platform shows that he not only has "no difference" from Nixon in the "purpose" of adhering to the US ruling clique's aggressive and reactionary policies, but also has very little "difference" in the methods of achieving this purpose. Kennedy particularly emphasized the need to take further tax increases and further inflation measures to greatly increase military spending and expand war preparations.

According to US news agencies, for candidates like Nixon and Kennedy, who are birds of a feather, American voters "were not enthusiastic about either of them" when voting, and "some voters said they chose Kennedy simply because 'I don't like Nixon.'" The British "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in Washington also reported on the 8th that "there is a general lack of enthusiasm for either candidate in many areas." Many voters wore badges with "Neither Supported" on their lapels.

Many American and British newspapers believe that Kennedy will face a difficult and tricky situation after taking office, and his days will not be easy. The British "Guardian" argued on the 8th that the newly elected US president will face "an unprecedented series of problems, in some respects, unlike any that any American president has ever encountered" in a century, including "Soviet satellites flying over the White House," the problem of "corporate decline" (referring to the economic crisis), "the threat of inflation," "the civil rights problem" (referring to the black people's struggle), "Castro shattered the American fantasy of (permanent rule in Latin America)," and so on.

An Associated Press reporter also mentioned in a news item on the 6th that he will face "divisions" within the Western camp and a situation of moving towards disintegration. "The Christian Science Monitor" exclaimed that the next US president is "facing the test of a world full of crises."

    美国大选见分晓　垄断财团换工具
    冷战政客尼克松自认失败　反共先锋肯尼迪乘机上台
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国大选昨天举行。根据初步结果，共和党总统候选人尼克松、副总统候选人洛奇已经肯定失败，民主党候选人肯尼迪和约翰逊分别当选为明年1月就职的美国下届总统和副总统。
    根据已经发表的初步结果，肯尼迪已获得二百八十五张选举人票，比当选所必需的二百六十九票多十六票（选举人票的总数是五百三十七）。尼克松获得一百七十张选举人票。在今天下午，尼克松已发表声明，承认失败。
    在同时举行的国会选举里，共和党也遭到失败，民主党将继续保持参众两院的多数。初步结果，民主党在改选的三十四个参议院席位中取得二十个席位，和不改选的民主党席位合计已占有六十三席，超过了参议院的全部席位（一百席）的一半。共和党已赢得十三个新席位，连同不改选的二十三席，一共三十六席。在全部改选的四百三十七个众议院席位中，已知民主党赢得二百四十九席，共和党赢得一百五十五席。
    尼克松和共和党的失败反映了执政近八年的艾森豪威尔—尼克松政府的外交和内政政策的破产。最近几年来，特别是1957年国际形势发生东风压倒西风的明显变化以来，美国政府坚持的侵略和战争政策不断遭到严重挫败，受到各国人民愈来愈强烈的反对。破坏最高级会议拆穿了自己的假和平面具以及吃了日本人民闭门羹等事件，更使艾森豪威尔—尼克松政府的不得人心达到了极点。在国内方面，随着新的经济危机的逼近，黄金储备的迅速外流，失业人数的增加和农民收入的降低，人民的不满也日益增长。路透社9日在一条消息上说，美国选民“要求来一个改变”。
    肯尼迪出身于马萨诸塞州被称为美国十二个最大的豪富家族之一的肯尼迪家族，一直得到美国东部大垄断财团的支持。他在竞选中竭力利用共和党政府内外政策的失败大肆攻击共和党，作为抬高自己的资本。但是肯尼迪的竞选纲领表明，他不仅对于坚持美国统治集团的侵略和反动政策的“目的”同尼克松并无“不同”，而且在实现这种目的的方法上也很少“差异”。肯尼迪特别强调要采取进一步增税和进一步通货膨胀的措施，以大量增加军费，扩大战争准备。
    据美国通讯社报道，对于尼克松和肯尼迪这样一丘之貉的候选人，美国选民在投票时“对任何一人都不顶热心”，“一些选民说，他们选择肯尼迪，只是因为‘我不欢喜尼克松’。”英国“每日电讯报”驻华盛顿记者8日也报道说，“许多地区对任何一个候选人都普遍缺乏热情”。许多选民在衣襟上配带了“两个都不支持”的徽章。
    美国和英国许多报纸纷纷认为，肯尼迪就任后势将面临一个困难棘手的局面，日子并不好过。英国的“卫报”8日认为，新当选的美国总统将面临百年来“在某些方面是任何一个美国总统从未遇到过的空前困难的一系列问题”，其中包括
  “苏联卫星飞在白宫顶上”，“企业衰退”（指经济危机）问题，“通货膨胀的威胁”，“民权问题”（指黑人斗争），“卡斯特罗粉碎了美国喜爱的（永久统治拉丁美洲的）幻想”等等。
    美联社记者6日在一条消息中也谈到他将面临西方阵营内部的“分歧”和走向分崩离析的局面。“基督教科学箴言报”惊呼下届美国总统正“面临危机重重的世界的考验”。
