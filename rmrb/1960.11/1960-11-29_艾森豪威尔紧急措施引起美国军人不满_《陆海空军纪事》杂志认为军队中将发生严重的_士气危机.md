    Eisenhower's Emergency Measures Arouse Dissatisfaction Among American Soldiers
    "Army, Navy, Air Force Journal" Believes a Serious "Morale Crisis" Will Occur in the Army

    (Dispatch from our newspaper) U.S. President Eisenhower's recent decision to reduce the number of dependents of U.S. troops stationed overseas in order to alleviate the international balance of payments deficit is arousing dissatisfaction and resistance among U.S. military personnel. These people are worried that this measure will affect the "morale" of U.S. troops stationed overseas.

    United Press International reporter Ferguson said in a report issued a few days ago that "American soldiers and their families" have "expressed fear, panic, anger and helplessness" at Eisenhower's "cost-saving approach."

    The report also revealed that some U.S. military personnel stationed overseas have expressed concern that the implementation of Eisenhower's instructions may foreshadow the "weakening of American military power" which constitutes the core of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, two aggressive blocs.

    According to Agence France-Presse's Washington report, the U.S. government's emergency measures have been openly criticized by Army Secretary Brucker. In a speech to the National Convention of the Retired Officers Association on the 18th, Brucker expressed his opposition to the decision to repatriate 284,000 U.S. military dependents. He believes that these people and overseas troops staying in various places are a symbol of the United States' support for its allies, indicating that the United States "is willing to risk the same dangers as them—that no matter what happens, we will be there and not leave." Brucker stated that the importance of allowing military dependents to live overseas "can never be overestimated."

    At the same time, the U.S. military leadership is also worried that Eisenhower's emergency measures will have a "bad" impact on American soldiers. According to the Associated Press, the U.S. "military internally conducted lengthy studies and debates on this plan to reduce the number of dependents stationed abroad, including the possible impact on army morale and combat effectiveness."

    Although the results of the discussion have not been formally disclosed, according to the estimate of "Army, Navy, Air Force Journal," an American military publication published on the 19th, the U.S. government's measure may cause a "worst morale crisis since the pay cuts in 1933." The magazine also issued a warning in a commentary, "Ignoring the serious consequences on morale is utter stupidity."

    艾森豪威尔紧急措施引起美国军人不满
    《陆海空军纪事》杂志认为军队中将发生严重的“士气危机”
    本报讯　美国总统艾森豪威尔最近下令减少美国海外驻军家属人数以缓和国际支付逆差的决定，正在引起美国军方人士的不满与抵触。这些人士担心，这个措施将影响到美国海外驻军的“士气”。
    合众国际社记者福格逊在前几天发出的一篇报道中说，“美国军人及其家属”对艾森豪威尔这种“节约开支的办法”，已“表示出害怕、慌张、愤怒和无可奈何的情绪。”
    报道还透露，某些驻在海外的美国军方人士已经表示担心，执行艾森豪威尔的这个指示，可能预示构成北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织这两个侵略集团核心的“美国军事力量将告削弱”。
    据法新社的华盛顿报道称，美国政府的这一紧急措施，已遭到陆军部长布鲁克的公开指责。布鲁克18日在向美国退役军官协会全国大会发表的演说中，表示反对遣返为数二十八万四千名美国军人家属的决定。他认为，这些人和海外驻军留在各地，是美国支持它的盟国的一种象征，表明美国“愿意甘冒与他们同样的危险——就是不管发生什么情况，我们都将在那里不走。”布鲁克表示，对于让军人家属住在海外的重要性“是怎么也不会估计过高的。”
    与此同时，美国的军事领导机关也担心艾森豪威尔的这个紧急措施会在美国军人中产生“不良”的影响。据美联社透露，美国“军方内部对这项削减驻留外国的家属人数的计划，包括对军队士气的可能的影响和战斗效率问题在内”，曾经“进行了长时间的研究和辩论”。
    虽然讨论的结果并未正式透露，但是据19日出版的一家美国军事刊物《陆海空军纪事》的估计，美国政府的这项措施，可能会引起一次“自1933年减饷以来最糟糕的士气危机”。这家杂志还在一社评论中发出了警告，“忽视在士气方面造成的严重后果，是十足愚蠢的。”
