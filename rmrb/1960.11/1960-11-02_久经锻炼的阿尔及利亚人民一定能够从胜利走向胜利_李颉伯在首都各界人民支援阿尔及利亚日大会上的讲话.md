Today is the sixth anniversary of the heroic Algerian people's armed uprising against the armed suppression of French colonialists. People from all walks of life in our capital are gathering here solemnly to pay high tribute to the heroic Algerian people who are fighting bravely and to express our firm support for the just struggle of the heroic Algerian people.

The heroic Algerian people, holding high the banner of national liberation war, have always stood firmly at the forefront of the African people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The national armed uprising launched by the Algerian people on November 1, 1954, against the French colonialists was an important turning point in the Algerian national liberation struggle. In these six years, the heroic Algerian people and the National Liberation Army have grown stronger as they fought, bravely resisting the 800,000 French colonial troops equipped with modern equipment, and have annihilated as many as 150,000 French colonial troops. The Algerian National Liberation Army, which has continuously grown stronger in the fighting, has now developed from the original 3,000 people into a powerful liberation army of 130,000 people, and has liberated large areas of land accounting for more than half of Algeria's population. The establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria marks a new stage in Algeria's national liberation movement. The great victories achieved by the Algerian people have once again proved that imperialism, which represents decadent forces, is actually weak despite its seeming strength. Their temporary arrogance is nothing but a dying struggle. The truly powerful and invincible are not the corrupt imperialists, but the awakened and united people who persist in revolutionary struggle. The Chinese people, who have been liberated after a long and arduous struggle, firmly believe that the Algerian people, who have been tempered by the long revolutionary war, will surely win the final victory.

The national liberation war waged by the Algerian people is a brilliant example of the African national liberation movement, and its significance and impact far exceed the scope of Algeria alone. The heroic resistance of the Algerian people has not only given great spiritual encouragement to the people of all African countries who are striving for national liberation, but also continuously consumed and contained the main force of the French colonial army supported by US imperialism, thereby directly and powerfully supporting the African people's struggle against imperialism and for national independence, disrupting the imperialists' plans to prepare for a new war, and making a significant contribution to defending world peace.

However, on the road to increasing victory, the Algerian people are not only facing the enemy of French colonialism, but also the more insidious and more ferocious enemy of US neo-colonialism. While helping the French colonialists to slaughter the Algerian people through various "aid" programs, US imperialism is trying to infiltrate its own forces into Algeria through its support for the French colonialists, in order to replace the French colonialists. Recently, US imperialism, under the banner of the United Nations, has armed intervention in the Congo, attempting to realize its sinister conspiracy to swallow the Congo. US imperialism also intends to use this sinister method for the aggression against the entire Africa. However, all these tactics of US imperialism have begun to be seen through by the Algerian people and more and more African people. Neither old colonialism nor neo-colonialism, none of their conspiracies can stop the Algerian people and the people of African countries from advancing along the road of national liberation.

The Chinese people deeply understand from their own experience of protracted struggle against imperialism that the national liberation war waged by the Algerian people is a long-term and arduous struggle. The enemy they face is still strong for the time being, and the Algerian people will still encounter many difficulties in their struggle. But we believe that the future of the Algerian people's struggle is infinitely bright, because the war they are waging is a just and progressive war, which is not only unanimously supported by the vast Algerian people, but also sympathized and supported by all just people in the world. The experience of the Chinese people and the people of the world in the anti-imperialist struggle has repeatedly proved that the main factor determining the outcome of a war is not weapons, but the will of the people. As long as the strength of the vast Algerian people is fully mobilized, unity is strengthened, struggle is persisted in, the enemy is continuously attacked, and oneself is strengthened, it is possible to grow from small to large, from weak to strong, to turn from inferiority to superiority, to overcome all difficulties, to persist in the struggle to the end, to drive out imperialism, and to realize complete national independence. All people who dare to rise up to fight for independence and freedom, and who dare to rise up to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and colonialism, are invincible. The heroic Algerian people and the people of all African countries will surely achieve the complete victory of the national liberation movement.

The Algerian people's struggle is by no means isolated. The African people, the Asian people, the Latin American people, the people of the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world firmly stand on the side of the Algerian people. The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and enthusiastically supported the Algerian people's national liberation struggle. Like the Algerian people, the Chinese people have suffered from long-term imperialist aggression and oppression, and still face the aggression and threat of US imperialism. In the struggle against imperialism, the Chinese people and the Algerian people share weal and woe, encourage each other, and support each other. Our interests are completely consistent. The Chinese people are as concerned about the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation as they are about their own cause. At the recent International Trade Union Committee for Support of Algerian Workers and People held in Havana, Cuba, the Chinese trade union delegation assured the Algerian people and the working classes of all countries that the Chinese workers will always be loyal to the liberation cause of the oppressed nations and oppressed peoples, and that the 650 million Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Algerian people.

At present, the East wind continues to prevail over the West wind, and the entire Africa and the world present an excellent situation. The raging waves of the national independence movement have swept across the entire African continent. The people's movement against imperialism and colonialism, for national independence and democratic freedom, and for striving for and safeguarding world peace is developing vigorously on a world-wide scale. The forces of socialism, the forces of national independence movements, the forces of people's revolutionary struggles, and all peace-loving forces are constantly strengthening and uniting to form an increasingly broad united front against imperialism. The development of the world situation is becoming more and more favorable to the people of all countries, and unfavorable to imperialism and its lackeys. Under this excellent situation, we believe that, with the support of the workers and people of the world, the heroic Algerian people will surely advance from victory to victory and make new contributions to combating imperialism and colonialism and defending world peace.

The Algerian people's cause of national liberation must achieve final victory, and the cause of liberation of all oppressed nations and peoples must achieve final victory! The cause of the people of the world for lasting peace and human progress must achieve final victory!

Long live the heroic Algerian people!
Long live the militant friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people!
Long live the great unity of the working class and people of the world!
Long live world peace!

    久经锻炼的阿尔及利亚人民一定能够从胜利走向胜利
    李颉伯在首都各界人民支援阿尔及利亚日大会上的讲话
    今天是英雄的阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民主义者的武装镇压，举行全民武装起义的六周年纪念日，我国首都各界人民在这里隆重集会，向正在英勇战斗的阿尔及利亚人民致以崇高的敬意，并对英勇的阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争表示坚决的支持。
    英雄的阿尔及利亚人民高举着民族解放战争的旗帜，一直坚定地站在非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的最前线。1954年11月1日，阿尔及利亚人民为反对法国殖民主义者所举行的全民武装起义，是阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争的一个重要转折点。在这六年中，英雄的阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放军越战越强，英勇地抗击着八十万具有现代化装备的法国殖民军，被歼灭的法国殖民军已达十五万人。在战斗中不断壮大起来的阿尔及利亚民族解放军，现在已由原来的三千人发展成为一支拥有十三万人的强大的解放军，并且解放了占阿尔及利亚人口半数以上的大片国土。阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的成立，标志着阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动已经进入了一个新的阶段。阿尔及利亚人民取得这些伟大胜利，又一次证明了代表腐朽势力的帝国主义虽然貌似强大，实际上是虚弱的。他们一时猖獗，不过是垂死的挣扎，真正有力量和不可战胜的绝不是腐朽的帝国主义，而是觉醒了的、团结起来坚持革命斗争的人民。经过长期艰苦斗争，获得解放的中国人民深信，久经革命战火锻炼的阿尔及利亚人民，必将获得最后的胜利。
    阿尔及利亚人民所进行的民族解放战争，是非洲民族解放运动的一个光辉榜样，它的意义和影响，远远地超越了阿尔及利亚一国的范围。阿尔及利亚人民的英勇抗战，不仅给予非洲正在争取民族解放的各国人民以极大的精神上的鼓舞，而且不断地消耗和牵制了在美帝国主义支持下的法国殖民军队的主力，从而直接有力地支持了非洲人民反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的斗争，打乱了帝国主义准备新战争的计划，为保卫世界和平作出了重大的贡献。
    但是在日益走向胜利的道路上，阿尔及利亚人民不仅面对着法国殖民主义这个敌人，而且还面对着美国新殖民主义这一更加阴险、更加凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义在通过种种“援助”，帮助法国殖民者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的同时，正在力图通过对法国殖民者的支持，把自己的势力渗入阿尔及利亚，以便取法国殖民者的地位而代之。最近，美帝国主义打着联合国的旗号，武装干涉刚果，企图实现其鲸吞刚果的罪恶阴谋。美帝国主义还打算把这一恶毒的手法，用于对整个非洲的侵略。但是美帝国主义的这一切手法，已经开始为阿尔及利亚人民和越来越多的非洲人民所识破，不管是老殖民主义，或是新殖民主义，他们的任何阴谋都阻挡不了阿尔及利亚人民和非洲各国人民沿着民族解放的大道前进。
    中国人民从自己同帝国主义进行长期斗争的经验中深深体会到：阿尔及利亚人民进行的民族解放战争是一场长期的、艰苦的斗争。他们所面对的敌人暂时还是强大的，阿尔及利亚人民还会在斗争中遇到不少困难。但是我们相信，阿尔及利亚人民斗争的前途是无限光明的，因为他们所进行的战争是正义的、进步的战争，不仅为阿尔及利亚广大人民所一致拥护，而且为全世界一切正义的人们所同情和支持。中国人民和世界人民反帝斗争的经验都一再证明：决定战争胜负的主要因素不是武器，而是人心的向背。只要把阿尔及利亚广大人民的力量充分地动员起来，加强团结，坚持斗争，不断地打击敌人，壮大自己，就能够从小到大，由弱变强，从劣势转为优势，就能够排除万难，把斗争坚持到底，把帝国主义赶出去，实现彻底的民族独立。一切敢于起来争取独立自由，敢于起来同帝国主义、殖民主义进行坚决斗争的人民，都是不可战胜的。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民和非洲各国人民一定会得到民族解放运动的彻底胜利。
    阿尔及利亚人民的斗争决不是孤立的。非洲人民、亚洲人民、拉丁美洲人民、整个以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的人民和全世界一切爱好和平、主持正义的人民，都坚决站在阿尔及利亚人民这一边。中国人民一向深切地同情和热烈地支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争。中国人民同阿尔及利亚人民一样，曾经遭受过帝国主义长期的侵略和压迫，直到目前还面临着美帝国主义的侵略和威胁。在反对帝国主义的斗争中，中国人民和阿尔及利亚人民休戚与共、互相鼓舞、互相支持。我们的利益是完全一致的。中国人民像关心着自己的事业一样，关心着阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放的斗争。最近在古巴哈瓦那召开的国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人和人民委员会会议上，中国工会代表团向阿尔及利亚人民和各国工人阶级保证，中国工人永远忠实于被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放事业，六亿五千万中国人民始终是阿尔及利亚人民的最可靠的朋友。
    目前，东风继续压倒西风，整个非洲和全世界呈现了一片大好形势。民族独立运动的怒涛，已经席卷了整个非洲大陆。反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取民族独立和民主自由、争取和维护世界和平的人民运动，正在世界范围内波澜壮阔地向前发展。社会主义力量、民族独立运动力量、人民革命斗争力量和一切爱好和平的力量正在不断增强，并且团结起来形成日益广泛的反对帝国主义的统一战线。世界局势的发展越来越有利于各国人民，而不利于帝国主义及其走狗。在这种大好形势下，我们相信，英雄的阿尔及利亚人民在全世界工人和人民的支持下，一定能够从胜利走向胜利，为打击帝国主义和殖民主义，保卫世界和平，作出新的贡献。
    阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放事业，一定要取得最后胜利，所有被压迫民族和人民的解放事业，一定要取得最后胜利！全世界人民争取持久和平和人类进步的事业一定要取得最后胜利！
    英雄的阿尔及利亚人民万岁！
    中国和阿尔及利亚人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    世界工人阶级和人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
