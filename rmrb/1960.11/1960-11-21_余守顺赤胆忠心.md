    Yu Shushun's Utter Loyalty
    Su Yi
    Today, this newspaper published the advanced deeds of Comrade Yu Shushun, the captain of the Third Production Team of the Third Management Area of the Huanglin Commune in Santai County, Sichuan Province. Reading it is exciting and leaves one unable to calm down...
    Comrade Yu Shushun has many noble qualities worthy of our learning. But his most prominent feature is his infinite loyalty to the Party and the revolutionary cause, and his infinite loyalty to the working people—his class brothers. Proceeding from this, he has a magnificent revolutionary spirit, determined to change the poor face of his hometown, unwavering and never shrinking in the face of any difficulties.
    Agricultural production has its arduous complexity. Dealing with nature, there are unpredictable events, and various floods and droughts are difficult for people to completely control; dealing with various organisms, the growth patterns of many crops cannot be mastered all at once; coupled with the barren land in his hometown, the production level has always been low, and the lives of the masses are relatively difficult; although the countryside has embarked on the road from mutual aid cooperation to the people's commune, these are still difficulties.
    Comrade Yu Shushun was not intimidated by these difficulties.
    Is the soil in his hometown barren? With the courage of the Foolish Old Man, he and many commune members carried mud and transported fertilizer to improve the soil. When drought struck and there was not enough food, he led the masses in a self-reliant struggle to extract grain from the land. In less than two years, the appearance of the poor and food-deficient hometown changed, and the masses were well-fed and clothed, and their mental outlook was also completely renewed.
    As a leader of the basic production unit in the countryside, Comrade Yu Shushun deeply understands the importance of his job and has established a high sense of responsibility to the Party and the people. He once expressed his thoughts on being a team leader this way: "The affairs of forty-odd households cannot be careless. Leading well, establishing a family and a career is in your hands; leading poorly, misfortune and failure are also in your hands." This is very true. The production team is the most basic organization of the people's commune's production activities. All production plans of the people's commune must be implemented in the production team, and the people's commune's arrangements for the lives of the masses must be implemented in the production team. Many policies regarding the people's commune must be specifically implemented among the masses through the production team. Whether a production team is led well or not directly affects the success or failure of dozens of households, and also affects the implementation of the Party's policies, affecting the speed of the Great Leap Forward and the consolidation and development of the people's commune. To be a good production team leader, one certainly needs wisdom and talent, but especially needs infinite loyalty to the Party and the people and a high sense of responsibility. Precisely because Comrade Yu Shushun possesses such excellent qualities, he can be selfless, rely on the masses, work hard, and achieve victory.
    Undoubtedly, all parts of the country have their own Yu Shushun-style "heads of households." Because they work hard with the masses, our agricultural production can advance so quickly by leaps and bounds. For a greater and better leap forward, we need more and more Yu Shushun-style advanced figures, who, like him, are utterly loyal and wholeheartedly serve the working people, and dare to despise difficulties, welcome difficulties, and overcome difficulties. In this way, we will continue to create miracles in thousands of production teams, win one victory after another, and completely change the economic face of our country's countryside!

    余守顺赤胆忠心
    苏宜
    本报今天发表了四川省三台县黄林公社第三管理区第三生产队队长余守顺同志的先进事迹，读了令人激动，不能平静……
    余守顺同志有许许多多高贵的品质，值得我们学习。而他的最突出之处，是对党和革命事业的无限忠诚，对劳动人民——阶级弟兄的无限忠诚。由此出发，他有了雄壮的革命气概，立志要改变家乡的贫困面貌，在任何艰难困苦面前，毫不动摇，从不畏缩。
    农业生产是有它的艰巨复杂性的。和自然打交道，天有不测风云，各种水旱灾害有些人力还难以完全控制；和各种生物打交道，许多农作物的生长规律也不能一下子就掌握；加上他的家乡土地贫瘠，生产水平一向不高，群众生活比较艰苦；农村中尽管已经走上从互助合作到人民公社的大道，但这些还都是困难。
    余守顺同志没有被这些困难所吓倒。
    家乡的土壤瘠薄吗？他以愚公般的勇气，和许多社员一道挑泥运肥，改良土壤。遭了旱灾，粮食不够吃，他领导群众开展了自力更生、向土要粮的斗争。不到两年，贫困缺粮的家乡面貌改变了，群众个个丰衣足食，思想面貌也焕然一新。
    作为农村基层生产单位的领导者，余守顺同志深深了解到他的工作岗位的重要，树立了对党对人民高度的责任感。他曾经这样表达过他当队长的心思：“四十几户人的事情，不可马虎，领导得好，成家立业在你手上；领导不好，背时倒灶也在你手上。”这话很对。生产小队是人民公社生产活动最基层的组织，人民公社的一切生产计划都要落脚到生产小队，人民公社对群众生活的安排要落实到生产小队，关于人民公社的一切政策，很多要通过生产小队具体贯彻到群众中去。一个生产小队，领导得好不好，不仅直接关系到几十户人家的兴衰成败，也关系着党的方针政策的贯彻，影响到大跃进的速度和人民公社的巩固和发展。而当好一个生产小队队长，固然需要有智慧和才干，尤其需要对党和人民的无限忠诚和高度的负责精神。余守顺同志正由于具备了这样的优秀品质，才能大公无私，依靠群众，艰苦奋斗，取得胜利。
    无疑地，全国各地都有自己的余守顺式的“当家人”，由于他们和群众一起埋头苦干，我们的农业生产才能这样快地大踏步前进。为了更大的更好的跃进，我们需要更多更多的余守顺式的先进人物，像他那样地赤胆忠心、全心全意为劳动人民服务，而又敢于蔑视困难，迎接困难，战胜困难。这样，我们就会在千千万万个生产队不断创造出奇迹，夺取一个又一个的胜利，彻底改变我国农村的经济面貌！
