Xinhua News Agency, London, November 22nd: Just as U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Under Secretary of State Dillon are in Bonn coercing West Germany to bear the maintenance costs of U.S. troops in order to alleviate the U.S.'s international payments crisis, Britain has also decided to follow the U.S.'s example and make the same demand of West Germany.

According to British newspapers on the 22nd, in view of the pressure the United States has exerted on Adenauer in this regard, the British government will also demand that West Germany provide more money to maintain British troops stationed in West Germany after the expiration of the British-West German financial agreement (which has four months remaining). The British "Daily Mail" wrote that the British "government is now asking for a uniform Anglo-American policy." The "Daily Express" said, "Whitehall's aim is to work with the Americans to establish a line that guarantees this country has a clear right, based on the same reasons that (West Germany) signed anything with the United States, to demand that the Germans (West Germany) continue to pay (maintenance fees)."

After this news was revealed, British authorities immediately came out to deny it. However, an Associated Press dispatch from London said that if Adenauer accepts the U.S. demand that West Germany bear a greater share of the $700 million in U.S. troop maintenance fees annually, then Britain will certainly make the same demand.

### 白宫有例在先　白厅起而效尤  英国将要求西德增加英驻军占领费

    白宫有例在先　白厅起而效尤
    英国将要求西德增加英驻军占领费
    据新华社伦敦22日电　正当美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙在波恩胁迫西德承担美国驻军的维持费来减轻美国的国际支付危机的时候，英国也决定效法美国，向西德提出同样的要求。
    据英国报纸22日报道，鉴于美国在这方面对阿登纳施加了压力，英国政府也将要求西德在英国西德财政协定期满（距今还有四个月）之后，拿出更多的钱来维持英国驻西德的军队。英国“每日邮报”写道，英国“政府现在要求一种英美一致的政策”。“每日快报”说，“白厅的目的是同美国人合力订出一条路线，以保证这个国家有明确的权利根据（西德）同美国签订的任何东西以相同的理由要求德国人（西德）继续支付（维持费）”。
    这个消息透露出来之后，英国权威人士便马上出来否认。但是，美联社从伦敦发出的一条电讯说，如果阿登纳接受美国要求西德在每年七亿美元的美军维持费中承担更大的分额的话，那么英国肯定也将会提出同样的要求。
