    Shanghai Rushes to Manufacture Steelmaking Equipment and Accessories
    (By Our Newspaper) Shanghai's machinery, electrical, instrumentation, and other ten bureaus, with their 203 subordinate factories, are concentrating their main efforts on rushing to manufacture various equipment and accessories for steel plants. By the end of October, they had completed over 97% of the plan, powerfully supporting steel production.
    In order to accelerate the completion of the manufacturing tasks of steelmaking equipment, the Party committee secretaries of the relevant factories personally took charge. Leading cadres at all levels went deep into the front lines, not only making specific arrangements for the plan, but also extensively mobilizing the masses to break through weak links. In order to ensure the timely delivery of various equipment with guaranteed quality and quantity, the Industrial Production Committee of the Municipal Party Committee organized more than eighty factories to carry out large-scale collaboration, concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles. Factories responsible for producing various mainframes used various forms of "three-way combination," vigorously promoted the spirit of collaboration, and greatly accelerated the production progress.
    Hunan Commercial Employees Serve Factories and Mines
    (Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 12th) Commercial department employees in Hunan Province are actively organizing the production and supply of materials for daily life to support steel production. In the past two months, they have transferred materials worth more than 8 million yuan, ensuring the needs of steel production and steelworkers.
    All units within the provincial commercial system have established offices to support steel production. The Provincial Department of Commerce has formed two working groups to go to key factories and mines to inspect and assist work. Commercial departments in Shaodong, Taojiang, Changning and other counties, as well as Shaoyang, Lengshuijiang and other cities, have sent people to factories and mines several times to hold employee forums, comprehensively understand production and life needs, and formulate support plans. While doing a good job in material supply, commercial departments at all levels have expanded supply and service outlets, strengthened repair services, and increased the supply of daily necessities. Shaodong County has added sales agencies in factories and mines with more than 500 people, and organized peddlers to facilitate workers' purchase of goods.
    Guangfu Road Store Organizes On-site Supply
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 12th) The Guangfu Road Store in Tianjin recently organized a joint on-site team, selecting the most outstanding salespersons to be stationed permanently at the No. 4 Steel Rolling Plant. Zhang Shizhen, the nationally renowned red flag bearer for organizing people's economic life, serves as the leader of this on-site team.
    After entering the factory, they started by investigating the workers' lives. Based on the actual needs and economic conditions of the workers, and in the spirit of seeking the best while being economical, they delivered what the workers thought of and truly needed to the workshops. Several squad leaders in the first workshop gave Zhang Shizhen a thumbs up, saying, "You are really great, you take care of our families, and we'll take care of production."
