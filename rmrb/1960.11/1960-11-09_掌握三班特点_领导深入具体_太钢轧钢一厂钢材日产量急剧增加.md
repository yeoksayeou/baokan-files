Grasping the Characteristics of Three Shifts, Leadership Goes Deep and Specific
Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's Rolling Mill No. 1 Steel Output Increases Sharply

(Our Newspaper Taiyuan, 8th) Leading cadres of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company's Rolling Mill No. 1 have gone deep into the front line of production, specifically analyzing the different characteristics of the three shifts, and adopting different leadership methods, so that since September, the entire plant has continuously seen new situations of bumper harvests in every shift and high yields every day. The average daily steel production level has risen from 800 tons to over 1,000 tons, becoming an advanced unit in the entire company.

Rolling Mill No. 1 is a multi-trade unit with continuous three-shift production, and each shift can reflect the production results. In order to achieve daily output by guaranteeing shift output, they grasped the production situation of each shift during the production process. On the one hand, they understood the strengths of each shift, and on the other hand, they figured out the problems and weak links in production. Then, they fully utilized the strengths of each shift, promptly solved the problems that occurred in the production of each shift, and overcame weak links. When they focused on the three shifts of the medium-sized rolling mill workshop, they found that the strength of Shift A was that it handled accidents quickly and production was balanced; the strength of Shift B was that it changed rolls quickly; and the strength of Shift C was that it created new high-yield records. At the same time, it was also discovered that during the night shift (zero to eight o'clock shift), workers were prone to drowsiness in the three hours before dawn, from three to five o'clock, and output was prone to decline; the second shift (eight to sixteen o'clock shift) was relatively relaxed in spirit during the three hours from eleven to thirteen o'clock, and output was also prone to decline, while the third shift (sixteen o'clock to twenty-four o'clock shift) generally had more normal and stable production. After carefully studying the above rules, they adopted two sets of methods: one set of methods was to give full play to the strengths of each shift. Since Shift B changes rolls quickly, they try to shift the task of changing rolls to Shift B as much as possible; Shift C is good at creating new records, and when organizing high-yield days, they try to let Shift C take the lead; the characteristic of Shift A is balanced production, and when other shifts have deficits in production, they try to organize Shift A to make up for it as much as possible. The other set of methods is to eliminate problems and weak links before they occur. According to past experience that there were more problems in the three hours of the night shift from three to five o'clock, and more problems in the three hours of the second shift from eleven to thirteen o'clock, they adopted the method of grasping the middle and leading the two ends to overcome weak links; the production of the third shift is relatively normal, so they adopted the method of grasping both ends and leading the middle, first achieving a "successful start" and finally a "victorious conclusion" to seize a higher shift output level.

On the basis of grasping production by shift, the factory Party committee further utilized the three-time matching shift handover system of "handing over key points during shift change, and accepting experience during shift handover" to understand at any time the output targets completed by the previous shift, advanced experience, advanced deeds, advanced operating methods, and the production key points of the shift. Each shift carefully communicated the production targets within eight hours to all workers in the shift. At the same time, technical demonstrations and other methods were adopted to focus on promoting advanced experience, so that the leader of one shift became the leader of three shifts. At present, the experience of Shift C in creating high-yield records and the experience of Shift B in quickly changing rolls have been promoted in other shifts.

### 掌握三班特点　领导深入具体  太钢轧钢一厂钢材日产量急剧增加

    掌握三班特点　领导深入具体
    太钢轧钢一厂钢材日产量急剧增加
    本报太原8日电　太原钢铁公司第一轧钢厂领导干部深入生产第一线，具体分析三个班的不同特点，采取不同的领导方法，使全厂从9月到现在，连续出现班班丰收，日日高产的新局面。钢材平均日产水平，由八百吨上升到一千吨以上，成为全公司的先进单位。
    第一轧钢厂是多工种、三班连续生产的单位，每个班都能反映出生产效果。为了实现以班产保日产，他们在生产过程中，摸清各班的生产情况，一方面了解各班的长处，一方面弄清各班的问题和生产薄弱环节。然后再充分利用各班的长处，及时解决各班在生产中发生的问题，克服薄弱环节。他们在抓中型轧钢车间的三班时，发现甲班的长处是处理事故快，生产均衡；乙班的长处是快速换轧辊；丙班的长处是创造高产新纪录。同时也发现了夜班（零点到八点班）在黎明前三、四、五点三个小时内，工人中容易出现困倦现象，产量容易下降；二班（八点到十六点班）在十一、十二、十三点三个小时内，精神比较松散，产量也容易下降，而三班（十六点到二十四点班）则生产一般比较正常、稳定。在认真研究了上述规律后，他们便采取两套办法：一套办法是充分发挥各班所长。乙班换轧辊快，他们就尽可能把换轧辊的任务移到乙班来完成；丙班善于创造新纪录，在组织高产日的时候，就尽量由丙班来打先锋；甲班的特点是生产均衡，在其他班亏产的时候，就尽可能组织甲班来弥补。另一套办法是把问题和薄弱环节消灭在发生之前。根据以往夜班三、四、五点三个小时之内问题多，二班十一、十二、十三点三个小时内问题多，他们就采取抓中间带两头的方法，克服薄弱环节；第三班的生产比较正常，他们就采取抓两头带中间的办法，先来一个“旗开得胜”，最后来一个“胜利收兵”夺取更高的班产水平。
    在分班抓的基础上，厂党委又进一步利用“交班交关键、接班接经验”的三次对口交接班制度，随时了解上一班完成的产量指标、先进经验、先进事迹、先进操作方法和本班的生产关键。各班都把八小时内的生产指标，向全班工人细致交底。同时，还采取技术表演等办法，重点推广先进经验，使一班之长变为三班之长。目前丙班创造高产纪录的经验，乙班快速换轧辊的经验，已在其他班推广。
