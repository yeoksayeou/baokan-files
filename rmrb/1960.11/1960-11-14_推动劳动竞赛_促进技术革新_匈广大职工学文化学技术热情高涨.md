Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 12th: With the development of labor emulation and the technological innovation movement, the broad masses of workers in Hungary are increasingly enthusiastic about studying culture and science and technology, and have launched a variety of learning movements.

In order to help workers learn culture and scientific knowledge, the Society for the Popularization of Social and Natural Sciences, with the assistance of the trade unions, has established "Workers' Colleges" in various places in the past year, which are very popular among workers. At present, in the capital Budapest alone, there are more than one hundred "Workers' Colleges," most of which are directly located in factories and enterprises.

The "Workers' College" holds lectures twice a week, with scientists and university teachers explaining various production technology issues and scientific knowledge.

One hundred and sixty labor teams (a total of more than 1,600 miners) from the three coal districts of Oroslany, Totobanya, and Dorog in Komárom County actively participated in the "Miners' College" organized by the joint enterprises of various mining areas in the socialist labor emulation. They will achieve a level of knowledge equivalent to that of graduates from secondary technical mining schools through learning.

The Budapest Rubber Factory, the Győr Flax Mill, and the "November 7th Power Plant" are known as "factories where everyone learns and everyone innovates." The engineers and technicians of these three factories have carried out extensive mutual assistance and mutual learning movements with the workers, greatly promoting production. For example, the Győr Flax Mill has increased labor productivity by 36% in the past three years without increasing the number of employees or existing equipment.

The number of young people participating in the "Young Technical Experts Movement" is also increasing day by day. Now, the young workers of the Chepel Iron and Steel Plant in Budapest have all participated in this movement and proposed to master a skill skillfully within half a year.

More than 100,000 young workers from various factories and enterprises have also participated in the "Reading Movement" organized by the Communist Youth League. They have actively and systematically read many science and technology and literature books, greatly improving their cultural level.

In addition to these learning organizations and movements, collectives striving for the title of "Socialist Labor Team" have also included improving cultural and technical levels as one of the conditions for competition. (Attached picture)

    推动劳动竞赛　促进技术革新
    匈广大职工学文化学技术热情高涨
    新华社布达佩斯12日电　随着劳动竞赛和技术革新运动的开展，匈牙利广大职工学习文化和科学技术的热情日益高涨，开展了多种多样的学习运动。
    为了帮助职工学习文化和科学知识，最近一年以来，社会与自然科学普及协会在工会的协助下在各地开办了“工人学院”，很受职工们的欢迎。目前仅在首都布达佩斯，就有一百多个“工人学院”，其中大部分都直接设在工厂企业里面。
  “工人学院”每周举办两次讲座，由科学工作者和大学教师讲解各种生产技术问题和科学知识。
    科马罗姆州的奥罗斯拉尼、托托巴尼奥和多洛格三个煤区的一百六十个劳动队（共一千六百多名矿工）在社会主义劳动竞赛中积极参加了各矿区联合企业举办的“矿工学院”，他们将通过学习达到相当于采矿中等技术专科学校毕业生的知识水平。
    布达佩斯橡胶厂、吉厄尔市纺麻厂和“11月7日发电厂”被称为“人人学习、人人革新的工厂”。这三个工厂的工程师和技术员同工人开展了广泛的互相帮助和互相学习运动，大大推动了生产。例如吉厄尔市纺麻厂在过去三年内没有增加职工人数和原有设备的条件下，把劳动生产率提高了36％。
    参加“青年技术能手运动”的青年也一天比一天多起来。现在布达佩斯切佩尔钢铁厂的青年职工都参加了这一运动，并提出在半年内要熟练地掌握一门技术。
    各工厂企业还有十万多青年职工参加了共青团组织的“读书运动”，他们积极地有计划阅读了很多科学技术和文艺书籍，大大提高了文化水平。
    除了这些学习组织和运动以外，争取“社会主义劳动队”称号的集体也都把提高文化技术水平列为竞赛的条件之一。（附图片）
