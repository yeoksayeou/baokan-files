An Important Guarantee for Doing a Good Job in Party Committee Leadership Work
——Experiences from Studying "Methods of Work of Party Committees"
Gui Linqi, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee

Party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Continuously strengthening Party building and strengthening the Party's leading role are the primary issues in the proletarian revolutionary cause. In the process of leading the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong devoted great energy to building a "nationwide, mass-based, ideologically, politically, and organizationally fully consolidated Bolshevik Chinese Communist Party." Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied Lenin's theory of Party building to the practice of the Chinese revolution, thus comprehensively developing and enriching Lenin's theory of Party building. "Methods of Work of Party Committees," proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in March 1949, is one of Comrade Mao Zedong's major contributions to our Party's building and the Marxist-Leninist theory of Party building.

Party committees at all levels are the leading core of the Party in various regions or departments, and are the unified and comprehensive general leading organs for various tasks in various regions or departments. The implementation of the Party Central Committee's lines, principles, and policies is primarily carried out through Party committees at all levels. The proposal and resolution of major and principled issues in various tasks of a region or department are decided by the Party committee of that region or department. Therefore, the working condition and level of Party committees at all levels have a decisive effect on the smooth development of the revolutionary cause. Comrade Mao Zedong consistently emphasized the work of Party committees in Party building. He said: "It is extremely important for Party committees at all levels to do their leadership work well." In the later period of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the People's Liberation Army advanced victoriously, many liberated areas were already connected, and many cities had been liberated or were about to be liberated. The whole Party faced a new situation. In 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong drafted documents for the Party Central Committee, such as "On Establishing a Reporting System," "Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948," "The CCP Central Committee's Notice on the September Meeting," and "On Improving the Party Committee System," and made many specific instructions and regulations on implementing democratic centralism, strengthening the collective leadership of Party committees, and improving leadership methods under the new conditions. On the eve of the imminent national victory of the revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, put forward various guidelines for promoting the rapid national victory of the revolution and organizing this victory, stipulated the Party's basic policies in politics, economy, and diplomacy after the victory of the revolution, and made plans for the transition from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution; at the same time, Comrade Mao Zedong formulated "Methods of Work of Party Committees," which armed Party committees at all levels. This played an important guaranteeing role for Party committees to do a good job in leadership and realize the Party's historical tasks in the new era.

Comrade Mao Zedong has always attached importance to the issue of working methods. In every period of the Chinese revolution, he not only formulated correct lines, principles, and policies for the Party, but also formulated correct working methods. In "Methods of Work of Party Committees," Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the rich experience accumulated in our Party's long-term work and concretized it into twelve articles on the working methods of Party committees in vivid language, and once again warned the whole Party that "If we have correct guidelines and policies but neglect our working methods, problems will still arise." These twelve articles are organically connected, and each article contains profound content that requires us to study in depth and carefully research. Based on my initial understanding from personal study, I believe that these twelve articles comprehensively and systematically solve five important issues in the leadership work of Party committees. These are:

First, the issue of correctly combining collective leadership and individual responsibility.

Collective leadership is a basic principle in our Party's life. One of the fundamental conditions for our Party's leadership to maintain correctness and exert great power is that it is a collective leadership that is linked to the masses. However, while emphasizing and strengthening collective leadership, our Party does not deny or diminish the role of individuals, but recognizes and values the role of individuals. Collective leadership must be combined with individual responsibility, and the role of individuals can only be correctly exerted through the collective. The decision "On Improving the Party Committee System" drafted by Comrade Mao Zedong for the Central Committee requires Party committees at all levels to ensure collective leadership and prevent individual monopoly, and at the same time, pay attention to "the two cannot be neglected: collective leadership and individual responsibility." "Methods of Work of Party Committees" concentrates our Party's experience in this regard. In the first article, "The Party Committee Secretary Must Be Good at Being a 'Squad Leader'," on the one hand, it points out that "If the Party committee is to fulfill its task of leadership, it must rely on the 'squad' of the Party committee and give full play to their role," affirming the decisive significance of collective leadership and requiring the Party committee to strictly abide by the principle of collective leadership; on the other hand, it points out that the secretary bears a major responsibility in the Party committee collective and requires the secretary to be good at being a "squad leader" and give full play to the core role. This is of great significance for implementing collective leadership and doing a good job in the leadership work of Party committees. In the Party committee, there are experienced comrades from various fields who maintain close contact with the masses and grasp the situations and problems in various fields. Only by relying on this "squad" and giving full play to collective wisdom can we ensure correct decisions and realize correct leadership. However, any organized collective must have a head and a core, otherwise it will be headless and unable to exert collective power. The secretary (the first secretary where a secretariat is established) is the head and core of the Party committee. The collective leadership of the Party committee is the collective leadership with the secretary as the core. Therefore, the members of the Party committee should maintain this core, give the secretary good support, cooperate with the secretary in action, and help the secretary be a good "squad leader." If the secretary is a good "squad leader" and plays the core role, he will be able to better concentrate the wisdom of the whole and exert collective power to correctly and effectively solve problems, and act in unison to "lead hundreds of millions of people to fight and build." How the Party committee holds meetings is a problem that cannot be ignored in implementing collective leadership. Comrade Mao Zedong made detailed instructions on holding good meetings in his works such as "On Improving the Party Committee System" and "Land Reform and Party Consolidation Work in 1948." The articles "‘Public Notice’" and "‘Streamlining Administration’" in "Methods of Work of Party Committees" are the crystallization of these instructions.

Second, the issue of strengthening unity and ensuring ideological and action consistency.

Unity and unification on the basis of Marxism-Leninism are the life of the Party and the source of its strength. With a high degree of unity, the Party committee can, within its leadership scope, unite the whole Party and the entire people well, and victoriously realize the Party Central Committee's lines, policies, and policies, and complete various work tasks. "Methods of Work of Party Committees" includes articles such as "Put the Problems on the Table," "‘Exchange Information’," and "Pay Attention to Unite with Comrades Who Have Different Opinions to Work Together," which are aimed at consolidating and strengthening the Party committee's Marxist-Leninist unity and unification. "Putting the problems on the table" is extremely important for maintaining and strengthening the Party's unity. All elements engaged in anti-Party activities and right-wing elements who are anti-Party and anti-socialist, hidden in the Party, inevitably violate this article in their actions, because their opinions, propositions, and purposes cannot be exposed to the sun. Once they are put on the table for debate, their true colors will be exposed. Therefore, they can only stir up evil winds and fires behind the scenes and engage in conspiracies. When we put their problems on the table for debate, everyone's eyes will be brightened, and they will reveal their true colors. Solving ordinary differences of opinion within the Party also requires putting the problems on the table. It should be said that it is normal for Party committee members to have different opinions on a specific policy or work method, work measure, etc., or to have certain opinions on mutual relations. The only correct way to resolve this contradiction is to openly raise the issue and conduct discussions and mutual criticism. Communists prioritize the interests of the revolution and obey the truth. On this basis, contradictions can always be resolved. If problems are kept in the stomach and not put on the table, contradictions cannot be resolved quickly, which is not conducive to unity; violating the Party's organizational principles and making random comments behind the scenes is even more harmful. In his article "Combat Liberalism" in 1937, Comrade Mao Zedong severely criticized bad tendencies such as "not speaking face-to-face, but speaking randomly behind the scenes; not speaking at meetings, but speaking randomly after meetings," pointing out that this is a corrosive agent that undermines unity (since this article came out, liberalism within the Party has gradually disappeared). Regarding the issue of "exchanging information," this is not only necessary for strengthening unity, but also can help each member understand the overall situation and better participate in collective leadership. This is because: Party committee members usually preside over various aspects of work. Only by regularly exchanging information can they enhance mutual understanding and achieve a common language. Comrade Mao Zedong said in 1958 when talking about working methods that we should find opportunities several times a year to let those who do not have much contact with the affairs of this industry contact the affairs of this industry and give them the original materials or semi-finished products needed. To have a common language, we must first have the necessary common information knowledge. It also means this. Paying attention to uniting those who have different opinions from oneself and comrades who have made mistakes to work together is also of great significance in the Party's life. Our Party has a lot of experience in this regard. During the period when right-leaning and "left-leaning" opportunism ruled, sectarian cadre policies were implemented. They tried their best to exclude and "ruthlessly attack" those who had different opinions and so-called comrades who had made mistakes. While leading the Party to correct the opportunistic political line, Comrade Mao Zedong also criticized and overcame the erroneous cadre policies of the opportunists. Comrade Mao Zedong summarized the experience of intra-Party struggles, adopted the policy of "unity-criticism-unity" and "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the disease to save the patient" for comrades who had made mistakes, which ensured the high degree of unity and unification of the whole Party, enabling us to unite the entire people and seize the great victory of the revolution and construction cause.

Third, the issue of mastering correct leadership methods.

The most fundamental leadership method of our Party is the mass line, that is, from the masses, to the masses. Our Party constantly opposes subjectivism, bureaucracy, and commandism in leadership work. In the article "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," Comrade Mao Zedong made a theoretical generalization and specific regulations on the leadership method of the mass line. Article 4 of "Methods of Work of Party Committees" requires Party committees at all levels to conscientiously implement this method in their leadership work. This article focuses on two issues: one is that when the Party committee handles problems, it should ask the lower levels about things it does not understand or know, and first solicit the opinions of the lower levels before making a decision; the other is that it should be good at listening to and analyzing the opinions of the cadres below, accepting the correct ones, and criticizing the incorrect ones. Only by doing these two points can we ensure correct leadership. Because the leading organ is like a processing factory, it does not produce raw materials itself. Its opinions, plans, and methods are all processed based on materials from below. The leadership's foresight also comes from the practical experience of the masses, seeing the development trend of the movement from the practice of the masses, and discovering the germination of new things. Therefore, the leading organ must often conduct investigations and research to understand the materials below, including positive and negative materials; listen to the opinions below, including correct and incorrect opinions. However, what comes from below are still raw materials, which must be processed, that is, sorted, analyzed, criticized, and summarized to remove the dross, take the essence, absorb the correct ones, and criticize the wrong ones, in order to form correct leadership opinions. In addition to implementing the mass line, it is also a key issue for the Party committee to distinguish between primary and secondary, make comprehensive arrangements for work, and first grasp the main work. "Learn to ‘Play the Piano’" and "Grasp Tightly" are to solve this kind of leadership art. A Party committee comprehensively leads the work of a region or department, managing many aspects. It must have correct arrangements to both grasp the key points and take care of the overall situation in order to do the work well. In "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," Comrade Mao Zedong has already instructed on this. He said: "Within any one region there cannot be many central tasks at the same time. At a given period there can be only one central task, supplemented by other tasks of secondary or tertiary importance. Consequently, a person in charge of a region must consider the history of the struggle there and the environment of the struggle, and should put the different tasks in their proper places." In "Methods of Work of Party Committees," because the Party was facing new and more complex tasks at that time, this issue was even more important. Comrade Mao Zedong used the vivid metaphor of "playing the piano" to vividly illustrate this leadership art, deepen the understanding of the whole Party, and help local Party committees learn this leadership art.

Fourth, how to correctly grasp the policy issue.

Conducting specific analysis of specific problems is the fundamental requirement of dialectical materialist epistemology. We must study and analyze objective things to understand problems, deal with problems, formulate policies, and implement policies. How to prevent errors and ensure correctness? "Methods of Work of Party Committees" stipulates the two most basic points for us: one is "Have a ‘Sense of Numbers’" to pay attention to the quantitative aspects of situations and problems, to have a basic quantitative analysis, and to pay attention to the quantitative boundaries that determine the quality of things; the other is "Draw a Clear Line between Two Kinds of Boundaries," first, revolution or counterrevolution, and second, within the revolutionary ranks, to draw a clear line between right and wrong, achievements and shortcomings, and to clarify what is primary and what is secondary among them. This is based on the principles of dialectical materialism and the actual work experience of our Party, and is an important development of Comrade Mao Zedong's writings on strengthening investigation and research and opposing subjectivism. These two provisions have profound significance. Because in our work, whether we are dealing with class struggle issues or production and construction issues, if we do not have a "sense of numbers" in our minds, we will inevitably "close our eyes and catch sparrows" and "a blind man feeling an elephant," committing subjectivist errors. Therefore, to do leadership work and solve any problem, we must do in-depth investigation and statistical work to grasp the basic situation of objective things in terms of quantity; we must do meticulous analysis and research to clarify the quantitative boundaries that determine the quality of things; we must distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, distinguish between right and wrong, and distinguish between the mainstream and the tributaries. Only by conscientiously abiding by this method can we deal with problems realistically and correctly and avoid making principled errors. Later, in his works such as "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and in the struggle against right-leaning opportunism in 1959, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly expounded and developed these ideas, repeatedly teaching us to draw a clear line between two types of contradictions, to distinguish between nine fingers and one finger, and to oppose the one-sided and metaphysical method of "attacking one point without considering the rest." These instructions further armed our entire Party ideologically.

Fifth, the issue of being modest and prudent and maintaining the style of hard work and close ties with the masses.

At a time when the revolution was about to win national victory, Comrade Mao Zedong's inclusion of "Combating Pride" in the working methods of the Party committee was of extremely far-reaching significance. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, "This is a matter of principle for leaders and also an important condition for maintaining unity." Pride is a reflection of the bourgeois worldview and a result of the erosion and development of bourgeois ideology. If Party cadres, especially leading cadres, develop pride, it will be very harmful to the revolutionary cause. Because with the growth of pride, they will be satisfied with the status quo and stop thinking about progress; they will relax their vigilance against class enemies and disarm themselves spiritually; they will be unwilling to stand among the masses and want to stand above the masses, unwilling to approach the masses and listen to their opinions, and prefer to sit in the office and issue orders; they will haggle over status and treatment, calculate the enjoyment of life, and cannot work hard and conscientiously for the Party; they will only be willing to listen to flattery and praise, and unwilling to accept criticism and supervision, and may even develop into individualist careerists who confront the Party and undermine the Party's unity. Comrade Mao Zedong often sounded the alarm to the whole Party on this issue.
In April 1944, when the Party achieved great victories in the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong used historical lessons to earnestly educate the whole Party in "Study and the Current Situation." He said,
"There have been several occasions in the history of our Party when we showed great pride, and we suffered losses. ... All comrades in the Party must take these several occasions of pride and several mistakes as lessons. ... Do not repeat the mistake of being proud in victory." In April 1945, on the eve of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong again called on the whole Party in "On Coalition Government"
"To learn from the experience of the three periods, adopt a humble attitude, prevent a proud attitude, and better unite with all comrades in the Party and better unite with the people of the whole country outside the Party." At the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, Comrade Mao Zedong once again emphasized the problem of preventing the growth of pride after victory, taking credit for achievements, not seeking progress, indulging in enjoyment, and preventing the erosion of bourgeois ideology. At the same time, he took "Combating Pride" as a canon in the work of the Party committee, explicitly stipulating that it is forbidden to celebrate the birthdays of Party leaders, to use the names of Party leaders as place names, street names, and enterprise names, and to stop the phenomenon of singing praises and virtues. This has profound significance in helping the whole Party, especially the leading cadres of the Party, prevent pride, resist the intrusion of bourgeois ideology, and maintain the revolutionary style of hard work and close ties with the masses under the conditions of victory, and played a guaranteeing role ideologically and organizationally.

Like "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," "Methods of Work of Party Committees" is an outstanding document of Marxism-Leninism on leadership methods and a major development of the Marxist-Leninist theory of Party building. Worldview and methodology are unified. When solving leadership methods and working methods, Comrade Mao Zedong also developed Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism. Based on the law of unity of opposites, these two works creatively handled the contradictory relationships between individual guidance and general mobilization, leading backbone and the broad masses, democracy and centralization, collective and individual, unity and struggle, central work and general work, quantity and quality, etc., and expounded that different qualities of contradictions should be handled with different methods. It contains rich philosophical content and is a model for solving problems using dialectical methods.

"Methods of Work of Party Committees" reflects the objective laws of the leadership work of the Party committee. Abiding by and applying these objective laws can ensure that the Party committee is well united and consistent, fully exerts collective wisdom, correctly conducts leadership, and maintains a strong revolutionary will to lead the masses, continuously make revolution, and move forward forever. After winning national power, our Party's organizations at all levels correctly implemented the central line and policies, and rapidly achieved great victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction, which is inseparable from the implementation of these twelve working methods. At present, we are in a new upsurge of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The continuous leap forward in socialist construction and the further implementation of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation make our leadership tasks more arduous and the requirements for our leadership even higher. Under this new situation, we must further study and implement "Methods of Work of Party Committees" and all of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on leadership methods, continuously improve leadership methods and leadership style, and improve the level of leadership. In the past, Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province followed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and victoriously completed arduous leadership tasks in various periods, achieving great achievements in work. However, our understanding of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on leadership methods, especially "Methods of Work of Party Committees," is still not deep enough, and our mastery and application are still not sufficient. Therefore, we must work hard to study and master the working methods of Party committees and do a good job in the current work.

The leadership organs at all levels in Anhui Province have generally implemented the "two, one, one system" proposed by the Provincial Party Committee, that is, two-fourths of the cadres go down to the grassroots to squat, one-fourth of the cadres conduct roving inspections, and one-fourth of the cadres remain in the organs, changing every season and rotating with each other. More than 50% of the cadres above the county level have been sent down to the front line of production, which is an effective system for further implementing Comrade Mao Zedong's mass line leadership method and overcoming bureaucracy. However, the key to truly implementing this system lies in the local Party committees doing a good job in leadership. First of all, the first secretary is required to be a better "squad leader" and be good at playing the role of collective leadership. Now most of the members of the Party committee are divided into activities on the front line of production. The work of the Party committee should adapt to this new situation. The first secretary should do a good job in publicity and organizational work to his "squad" to unify understanding and unify action; the Party committee should correspondingly improve the meeting system, and each meeting should be prepared and organized well to solve problems and save time. Secondly, each member is required to pay more attention to strengthening unity, supporting each other, and "exchanging information" to combine grasping the points and participating in comprehensive leadership. As a leading member of the Party committee, when squatting down, on the one hand, he should appear in the posture of an ordinary worker, achieving "four same," and on the other hand, he must not forget his leadership responsibility. He should be good at observing problems, studying problems, and be good at listening to and analyzing the opinions of the masses, playing the role of a leading member. He should not only grasp the work of the point, but also care about and consider the comprehensive work, not only grasp the central work, but also take care of the departmental work. He should actively provide the Party committee and other members with the information he knows and his own opinions. After the implementation of the "two, one, one system," some comrades have a shift-work mentality, thinking that they are only responsible for comprehensive work when they stay in the organs, and only manage the work of one point when they squat down. This understanding is not correct. It must be made clear that as a member of the Party committee, squatting is also for the sake of the surface, and only by understanding the situation of the surface and having a comprehensive view can we better do the work of the point.

Learning to master the art of leadership is even more important now. The content of the work of the Party committee in a place today is much more complicated than in any previous period. It is necessary to grasp ideology, production, and life; to grasp agriculture, industry, transportation, finance and trade, politics and law, culture and education, and other aspects of work. Agriculture includes agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery, and crops include grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruit, medicine, and miscellaneous twelve major items, etc.; industry, transportation, finance, politics, and culture are also the same. It is really a lot of things. Moreover, the national economy is developing in a planned way, and various tasks are closely related, so we must learn the leadership art of "playing the piano." The entire national economy is based on agriculture and led by industry. Agriculture takes grain as the key link, and industry takes steel as the key link. This is the key to the key. Only when the key link is grasped can everything else fall into place. We must concentrate our efforts to first grasp and do a good job. However, other aspects of work must also be comprehensively and reasonably arranged according to the different circumstances of each period. When it is time to point, it should be pointed, and when it is time to grab, it should be grabbed. We cannot grab agriculture and lose industry, or grab grain and lose diversified operations. Now most of the cadres of the organs have gone down to squat or turn around, and many of the original departmental work are also engaged in central work. Under such circumstances, how departmental work can serve the central work, and how to do a good job in various departments around the central work must also be well resolved. Only when the "piano" is played well, the key points are prominent, and the overall situation is taken care of, can the socialist construction cause be guaranteed to develop forward at a high speed and proportionally.

We must have a "sense of numbers" in everything we lead. On this point, many comrades still do not pay enough attention to it. They often cannot grasp the quantity of situations and problems, lack basic quantitative analysis, and do not understand the quantitative boundaries that determine the quality of things. For example, in the previous period, some places did not have a "sense of numbers" about the use of labor, so that the needs of agricultural production could not be guaranteed in the arrangements. We must pay attention to this issue at all times in the future, whether we are doing political work or economic work; whether we are engaged in production or distribution, we must have basic investigation and basic analysis. It is certain that there will be errors if we do not have a "sense of numbers" in our minds. For example, how can we do a good job in political work if we do not understand the basic quantity of active, intermediate, and backward people among the masses? How can we do a good job in distribution if we cannot grasp the grain output and do not understand the quantitative boundaries between the state, the collective, and the individual? The advancement and backwardness of work are also generally manifested in certain quantitative boundaries. If we want to strive for the upstream, we must have a "sense of numbers" about our existing level and the advanced level at home and abroad, in order to propose appropriate struggle indicators and measures and go all out to work hard. Today, we are still in an environment of class struggle. There is imperialism internationally, and classes have not yet been eliminated domestically. The influence of the bourgeoisie in politics and ideology still exists. Therefore, when dealing with problems, we must first draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves and between right and wrong. For contradictions within the people, it is also necessary to distinguish whether it is a problem of class struggle or a problem of contradiction between the advanced and the backward. Then make a correct decision based on the Party's policies. There are still a few backward areas in our province. The reasons for these areas being backward are very complicated. In addition to objective factors such as poor natural conditions and more difficulties, there are mainly two situations: one is that the cadres are incompetent or the work style is not good; one is that a few bad elements have usurped the leadership and class enemies are carrying out sabotage activities. On the issue of cadre work style, there are also different natures. Some are basically good in essence, but have serious problems in work style, cannot correctly implement the Party's policies, thus hindering the exertion of the enthusiasm of the masses; some have very serious capitalist ideas, have resistance to socialism, refuse to implement or distort the Party's policies, engage in corruption, suppress the masses; some have degenerated and deteriorated and become bad elements who violate laws and discipline and are enemies of the people. When transforming backward units, it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations, carefully analyze, draw a clear line, and treat them differently. It is necessary to prevent two kinds of deviations: we cannot treat bad elements and counter-revolutionaries as contradictions among the people, nor can we treat cadres with errors in their thinking and work style as contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. We must also distinguish between general errors and serious errors in cadre work style, and between those who are basically good in essence and those who are not good in essence. Only by handling it correctly in this way can we effectively help backward units transform. If we confuse the nature of the problem, we will not only fail to solve the problem, but also make right or "left" errors. We must also have a comprehensive understanding of the achievements and shortcomings of our work, grasping the mainstream and not neglecting the tributaries. Under the guidance of the Party's correct line, from a comprehensive perspective, the achievements in our work are always the main ones, and there will be no shortcomings and backwardness, but these shortcomings and backwardness are still a problem of one finger or less than one finger compared with the total achievements. Therefore, comrades who work in backward areas should not take the backward situation there as the overall situation, because this will obscure the mainstream in the work and there is a danger of losing direction; comrades who work in advanced areas should not regard their advanced situation as the overall situation and ignore the tributaries, because this will easily lead to blind complacency. In addition, some comrades often relax after solving a prominent problem in their work, and do not go to discover and solve new problems, as if everything is going well. This is also a one-sidedness that only sees one point and does not see the whole. We should learn to look at problems comprehensively and overcome and prevent one-sidedness.

Our work achievements are great, and the Party has unlimited prestige among the people, but we have no reason to be proud. We are continuous revolutionists, and the revolution is never-ending. In the past two or three years, our country and our province have undergone continuous great leaps forward. The speed of economic construction is astonishing and the achievements are great, but our situation of "poverty and blankness" has not been fundamentally changed. We still have many difficulties in front of us. U.S. imperialism is still invading us, and the reactionaries and modern revisionists of some countries want to isolate us. The enemy's goal will never be achieved, and the question is whether we ourselves do our job well. Every cadre of ours, especially the leading members of the Party committee, must firmly remember Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, resolutely guard against pride, carry forward the style of hard struggle, continue to hold high the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, work diligently and thriftily, bury ourselves in hard work, strive to become stronger, strive to complete the current production increase and thrift plan centered on grain and steel, strive to build a powerful socialist motherland with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and strive to realize our great ideal of communism.

    做好党委领导工作的重要保证
    ——学习《党委会的工作方法》的体会
    中共安徽省委书记处书记　桂林栖
    党的领导是无产阶级革命事业胜利的根本保证。不断加强党的建设，加强党的领导作用，是无产阶级革命事业中首要的问题。毛泽东同志在领导中国革命的过程中，为建设一个“全国范围的、广大群众性的、思想上政治上组织上完全巩固的布尔塞维克化的中国共产党”①，付出了极大的精力。毛泽东同志创造性地运用列宁的建党学说于中国革命的实际，从而全面发展和丰富了列宁的建党学说。毛泽东同志1949年3月在党的七届二中全会上提出的《党委会的工作方法》，就是毛泽东同志对我党建设和马克思列宁主义建党学说的重大贡献之一。
    党的各级委员会，是党在各个地区或各个部门的领导核心，是各个地区或各个部门各项工作的统一的、全面的总领导机关。党中央的路线、方针、政策的贯彻执行，首先通过党的各级委员会。一个地区、一个部门各项工作中重大的、原则性的问题的提出和解决，决定于这个地区、这个部门党的委员会。所以，党的各级委员会的工作状况、工作水平，对革命事业的顺利发展，有决定性的作用。毛泽东同志在党的建设中一贯重视党委会的工作，他说：“党的各级委员会把自己的领导工作做好，是极为重要的。”②在第三次国内革命战争后期，解放军胜利进军，许多解放区已经联成一片，许多城市已经解放或者即将解放，全党面临新的形势。1948年，毛泽东同志先后为党中央起草了《关于建立报告制度》、《一九四八年的土地改革工作和整党工作》、《中共中央关于九月会议的通知》、《关于健全党委制》等文件，对在新的条件下贯彻民主集中制，加强党委会的集体领导，改进领导方法，做了许多具体指示和规定。在革命即将取得全国胜利的前夜，毛泽东同志在党的七届二中全会上，提出了促进革命迅速取得全国胜利和组织这个胜利的各项方针，规定了革命胜利以后党在政治、经济、外交各方面的基本政策，作出了民主革命向社会主义革命转变的规划；与此同时，毛泽东同志又制定了《党委会的工作方法》，武装了党的各级委员会，这对党委会做好领导工作，实现党在新时期的历史任务起了重要的保证作用。
    毛泽东同志一贯重视工作方法问题。他在中国革命的各个时期，不仅为党制定了正确的路线、方针、政策，而且制定了正确的工作方法。在《党委会的工作方法》中，毛泽东同志概括了我们党长期工作中积累的丰富经验，用形象的、生动的语言，将它具体化为党委会工作方法十二条，并且再次告诫全党说，“有了正确的方针政策，如果在工作方法上疏忽了，还是要发生问题。”③这十二条工作方法是有机联系的，每一条都包含着深刻的内容，需要我们深入学习，细心钻研。根据个人学习的初步体会，我认为，这十二条全面地系统地解决了党委会领导工作中的五个重要问题。这就是：
    第一，集体领导与个人负责正确结合的问题
    集体领导是我们党的生活中的一个基本原则。我们党的领导所以能够保持正确，发挥伟大的力量，根本条件之一，就是在于它是联系群众的集体领导。但是，我们党在强调和加强集体领导的时候，并不否定和降低个人的作用，而是承认和重视个人的作用。集体领导必须同个人负责相结合，个人的作用只有通过集体才能得到正确的发挥。毛泽东同志为中央起草的《关于健全党委制》的决定，要求各级党委在保证集体领导、防止个人包办的同时，必须注意“集体领导和个人负责，二者不可偏废。”④《党委会的工作方法》集中了我们党在这方面的经验。在第一条《党委书记要善于当“班长”》中，一方面指出“党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这‘一班人’，充分发挥他们的作用”⑤，肯定了集体领导的决定性意义，要求党委会必须严格遵守集体领导的原则；另一方面，指出书记在党委会这个集体中负有重大的责任，要求书记必须善于当“班长”，充分发挥核心作用。这对贯彻集体领导，做好党委会的领导工作，具有非常重要的意义。在党的委员会中，拥有各方面的有经验的同志，这些同志与群众保持着密切的联系，掌握各方面的情况和问题，只有依靠这“一班人”，充分发挥集体智慧，才能保证作出正确的决定，实现正确的领导。但是任何一种有组织的集体都要有个头，有个核心，否则就会群龙无首，就不能发挥集体力量。书记（建立书记处的地方是第一书记）就是党委会的头和核心，党委会的集体领导就是以书记为核心的集体领导。所以，党委会的成员应该维护这个核心，给予书记以很好的支持，在行动上与书记合拍，帮助书记当好“班长”。书记当好了“班长”，发挥了核心作用，也就能够更好地集中全体的智慧，发挥集体的力量，正确而有效地解决问题，并动作整齐地“带领千百万人去作战，去建设”。党委会如何开会，是贯彻集体领导的一个不可忽视的问题，毛泽东同志在《关于健全党委制》、《一九四八年的土地改革工作和整党工作》等著作中，对开好会曾经做了详细的指示。《党委会的工作方法》中《“安民告示”》、《“精兵简政”》两条，就是这些指示的结晶。
    第二，加强团结，保证思想一致、行动一致的问题
    在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结和统一，是党的生命，是党的力量所在。党的委员会有了高度的团结，就能在它所领导的范围内，很好地团结全党，团结全体人民，胜利地实现党中央的路线和方针、政策，完成各项工作任务。《党委会的工作方法》中《要把问题摆到桌面上来》、《“互通情报”》、《注意团结那些和自己意见不同的同志一道工作》等条，就是为了巩固和加强党委会马克思列宁主义的团结和统一的。《把问题摆到桌面上来》，对维护和加强党的团结是极关重要的。一切进行反党活动的分子以及隐藏在党内的反党反社会主义的右派分子，在行动上都必然违反这一条，因为他们的意见、主张和目的都是见不得太阳的，摆到桌面上来就暴露了真面目，所以只能在背后暗地里刮阴风，吹阴火，搞阴谋活动。当我们把他们的问题摆到桌面上来一辩论，大家的眼睛就亮了，他们就现原形了。解决党内一般的意见分歧，也必须把问题摆到桌面上来。党委会成员间对某项具体的政策或者工作方法、工作措施等抱有不同意见，或者相互关系上有某些意见，这应该说是正常现象。解决这种矛盾的唯一正确的办法，就是开诚布公地提出问题，进行讨论和相互批评。共产党员是以革命利益为重的，是服从真理的，在这个基础上，矛盾总是可以解决的。把问题闷在肚子里，不摆到桌面上来，矛盾就不能很快地得到解决，就不利于团结；违背党的组织原则，背后乱议论，危害更大。毛泽东同志1937年在《反对自由主义》一文中，就严厉批评了“当面不说，背后乱说；开会不说，会后乱说”等恶劣倾向，指出这是破坏团结的一种腐蚀剂（自从这篇文章出来以后，党内的自由主义就逐步基本上消失了）。关于《互通情报》问题，这不仅对加强团结是必要的，而且可以帮助每一个委员了解全面情况，更好地参与集体领导。这是因为：党委会的成员日常都分工主持各方面的工作，只有经常互通情报，才能增进彼此间的了解，取得共同的语言。毛泽东同志在1958年谈到工作方法时，说一年要找几次机会，让那些不大接触本行事务的人们，接触本行事务，给以适合需要的原始材料或者半成品，要彼此有共同的语言，必须先有必要的共同的情报知识，也是这个意思。注意团结那些和自己意见不同的同志以及犯过错误的同志一道工作，在党的生活中也有重大意义，我们党在这方面是有很多经验的。在右倾和“左”倾机会主义统治时期，实行了宗派主义的干部政策，他们竭力排斥和“无情打击”与自己意见不同的以及所谓犯错误的同志。毛泽东同志在领导党纠正机会主义政治路线的时候，也批判克服了机会主义者错误的干部政策。毛泽东同志总结了党内斗争经验，对于犯错误的同志采取“团结——批评——团结”和“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，就保证了全党高度的团结和统一，使我们能够团结全体人民，夺取了革命和建设事业的伟大胜利。
    第三，掌握正确的领导方法问题
    我们党最根本的领导方法是群众路线，即从群众中来，到群众中去。我们党经常不断地反对领导工作中的主观主义、官僚主义和命令主义。在《关于领导方法的若干问题》一文中，毛泽东同志对群众路线的领导方法作了理论的概括和具体的规定。《党委会的工作方法》第四条，就是要求各级党委在领导工作中认真贯彻这个方法。在这一条里，着重指出了两个问题：一个问题是党委会处理问题的时候，不懂和不了解的东西要问下级，先征求下级意见，然后再做决定；一个问题是要善于倾听和分析下面干部的意见，接受正确的，批评不正确的。做到这两点，才能保证正确的领导。因为领导机关好似一个加工厂，自己并不生产原料，它的意见、计划、办法，都是根据来自下面的材料加工而成的。领导的预见性，也来源于群众的实践经验，从群众的实践中看出运动的发展趋向，发现新生事物的萌芽。所以领导机关必须经常调查研究，了解下面的材料，包括正面和反面的材料；倾听下面的意见，包括正确的与错误的意见。但是来自下面的还都是一些原料，必须经过加工，即整理、分析、批判和概括工作，去其糟粕，取其精华，吸收正确的，批判错误的，才能形成正确的领导意见。党委在领导工作中，除了贯彻群众路线以外，分清主次、全面安排好工作，并首先抓好主要工作，也是一个关键性的问题。《学会“弹钢琴”》和《要“抓紧”》，就是解决这种领导艺术问题的。一个党委会全面领导一个地区一个部门的工作，管的方面很多，必须要有正确的安排，既要抓住重点，又要照顾全面，才能把工作做好。在《关于领导方法的若干问题》中，毛泽东同志对此已经做了指示，他说：“在任何一个地区内，不能同时有许多中心工作，在一定时间内只能有一个中心工作，辅以别的第二位、第三位的工作。因此，一个地区的总负责人，必须考虑到该处的斗争历史和斗争环境，将各项工作摆在适当的地位。”⑥在《党委会的工作方法》中，由于当时党面临新的更为复杂的任务，这个问题更重要，毛泽东同志又用“弹钢琴”这个生动的比喻，形象地说明这种领导艺术，加深全党的认识，帮助各地党委学会这种领导艺术。
    第四，如何正确掌握政策的问题
    对具体问题进行具体分析，是辩证唯物主义认识论的根本要求。我们认识问题、处理问题，制定政策、执行政策，都必须对客观事物进行研究和分析。怎样防止错误，保证正确呢？《党委会的工作方法》为我们规定了最基本的两条：一条是《胸中有“数”》，对情况和问题一定要注意到它们的数量方面，要有基本的数量的分析，要注意决定事物质量的数量界限；一条是《划清两种界限》，首先是革命还是反革命，其次，在革命队伍中，要划清正确和错误、成绩和缺点的界限，还要弄清它们中间什么是主要的，什么是次要的。这是根据辩证唯物主义原理和我们党的实际工作经验提出的，是毛泽东同志关于加强调查研究反对主观主义的著作的重要发展。这两条规定具有深刻的意义。因为我们在工作中，无论是对待阶级斗争问题或是生产建设问题，如果胸中无“数”，就必然会“闭塞眼睛捉麻雀”、“瞎子摸鱼”，犯主观主义的错误；所以做领导工作，解决任何问题，必须做深入的调查统计工作，掌握客观事物在数量方面的基本情况；必须做细致的分析研究工作，弄清决定事物质量的数量界限；必须分清敌我，分清是非，分清主流和支流。只有认真地遵守这样的方法，才能够做到实事求是地正确处理问题，避免发生原则性错误。毛泽东同志以后在《关于农业合作化问题》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等著作中，以及在1959年反对右倾机会主义的斗争中，又多次阐述并发展了这些思想，反复教导我们要划清两类矛盾，区别九个指头和一个指头，反对“攻其一点，不及其余”的片面的形而上学的方法。这些指示从思想方法上进一步武装了我们全党。
    第五，谦虚谨慎，保持艰苦奋斗、联系群众的作风问题
    在革命即将获得全国胜利的时候，毛泽东同志把“力戒骄傲”列入党委会的工作方法中，其意义是极其深远的。正如毛泽东同志所说，“这对领导者是一个原则问题，也是保持团结的一个重要条件。”⑦骄傲情绪是资产阶级世界观的反映，是资产阶级思想侵蚀和发展的结果。党的干部，特别是领导干部，滋长了骄傲情绪，对革命事业是十分有害的。因为滋长了骄傲情绪，就会满足现状，不思前进；就会对阶级敌人放松警惕，解除精神武装；就会不愿站在群众之中，而想站在群众之上，不愿接近群众，听取群众意见，而宁愿坐在办公室里发号施令；就会斤斤计较地位、待遇，计较生活享受，而不能艰苦朴素、兢兢业业地为党工作；就会只愿听人奉承赞扬，不愿受人批评监督，甚至会发展成为与党对抗、破坏党的团结的个人主义野心家。毛泽东同志经常在这个问题上向全党敲警钟。
  1944年4月，当党在抗日战争中取得很大胜利的时候，毛泽东同志在《学习和时局》中，以历史教训谆谆教育全党，他说，
  “我党历史上曾经有过几次表现了大的骄傲，都是吃了亏的。……全党同志对于这几次骄傲，几次错误，都要引为鉴戒。……不要重犯胜利时骄傲的错误。”⑧1945年4月，在抗日战争胜利的前夜，毛泽东同志在《论联合政府》中，又号召全党
  “吸取三个时期的经验，采取谦虚态度，防止骄傲态度，在党内，和全体同志更好地团结起来，在党外，和全国人民更好地团结起来”。⑨在党的七届二中全会上，毛泽东同志再次着重提出了防止胜利后滋长骄傲情绪、以功臣自居、不求进步、贪图享乐，防止资产阶级思想腐蚀的问题，同时把“力戒骄傲”作为党委会工作中的一个律条，明确规定禁止给党的领导者祝寿，禁止用党的领导者的名字作地名、街名和企业的名字，制止歌功颂德现象。这对帮助全党，特别是党的领导干部，在胜利的条件下防止骄傲，抵制资产阶级思想的侵袭，保持艰苦奋斗、联系群众的革命作风，具有深刻的意义，在思想上、组织上起了保证作用。
    如同《关于领导方法的若干问题》一样，《党委会的工作方法》是马克思列宁主义关于领导方法的一篇杰出文件，是对马克思列宁主义建党学说的重大发展。世界观和方法论是统一的，毛泽东同志在解决领导方法、工作方法的时候，同时也就发展了马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物主义。这两篇著作根据对立统一的法则，创造性地处理了个别指导与一般号召，领导骨干与广大群众，民主与集中，集体与个人，团结与斗争，中心工作与一般工作，数量与质量等等矛盾关系，阐述了不同质的矛盾要用不同的方法处理，包含有丰富的哲学内容，是运用辩证方法解决问题的典范。
    《党委会的工作方法》反映了党委领导工作的客观规律，遵守和运用这些客观规律，就可以保证党委会很好地团结一致，充分发挥集体智慧，正确地进行领导，并且保持旺盛的革命意志，领导群众，不断革命，永远向前。我们党的各级组织，在取得全国政权以后，正确地执行了中央的路线和方针、政策，迅速取得社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，是和贯彻了这十二条工作方法分不开的。目前，我们正处在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新高潮中，社会主义建设事业的持续跃进，进一步贯彻以农业为基础的方针，使我们的领导任务更为繁重了，对我们领导的要求更加提高了。在这种新形势下，我们必须进一步学习和贯彻《党委会的工作方法》以及毛泽东同志关于领导方法的一切指示，不断改进领导方法、领导作风，提高领导水平。安徽省各级党的委员会，过去遵循毛泽东同志的指示，胜利地完成了各个时期艰巨的领导任务，在工作上取得巨大成绩。但是，我们对毛泽东同志关于领导方法的指示，特别是对《党委会的工作方法》领会还是不深的，掌握运用还是很不够的，因此我们必须努力学习，掌握好党委会的工作方法，做好当前的工作。
    安徽省的各级领导机关，已普遍实行省委提出的“二、一、一制”，即四分之二的干部下去蹲点，四分之一的干部巡回检查，四分之一的干部留在机关，一季一换，互相轮流的制度。县以上机关已有50％以上的干部下放到生产第一线，这是进一步贯彻毛泽东同志群众路线的领导方法，克服官僚主义的有效制度。但是，要真正贯彻好这个制度，关键在于各地党委做好领导工作。首先，要求第一书记更好地当“班长”，善于发挥集体领导作用。现在党委会的成员绝大部分都分工活动在生产第一线，党委会的工作应该适应这一新的情况，第一书记更要向自己的“一班人”做好宣传工作和组织工作，把“一班人”指挥好，以统一认识，统一行动；党委会要相应地改进会议制度，每次会议更要准备好组织好，做到既解决问题，又节约时间。其次，要求每一个委员更要注意加强团结，互相支持，更要“互通情报”，把抓点和参加全面领导结合起来。作为党委会的一个领导成员，在下去蹲点的时候，一方面要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现，做到“四同”，另一方面又不能忘记自己的领导责任。应该善于观察问题、研究问题，善于听取和分析群众意见，起到一个领导成员的作用。应该既抓好点的工作，又关心和考虑全面工作，既抓好中心工作，又照顾部门工作。应该积极地向党委和其他委员提供自己所了解的情况和自己的意见。实行“二、一、一制”以后，有的同志存在着一种轮班思想，认为留机关时才负责全面工作，蹲点时就只管一个点的工作，这种认识是不正确的。必须明确，作为党委会的一员，蹲点也是为了面，而且只有了解面的情况，有全面观点，才能更好地搞好点的工作。
    学会掌握领导艺术，现在更加重要了。一个地方的党委，今天的工作内容，比过去任何时期都复杂得多了，要抓思想、生产、生活；要抓农业、工业、交通、财贸、政法、文教等各方面工作。农业里面又有农、林、牧、副、渔，农作物里又有粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂十二大项，等等；工、交、财、政、文等方面也都是如此，真是千头万绪。而国民经济是有计划发展的，各项工作都有密切的联系，所以必须学会“弹钢琴”的领导艺术。整个国民经济以农业为基础，以工业为主导，农业以粮为纲，工业以钢为纲，这是重点的重点，纲举才能目张，我们必须集中力量首先抓紧抓好。但是其他各方面工作也必须根据每个时期的不同情况，做全面的合理安排，当点的时候就要点一下，当大抓的时候就要大抓一下，不能抓了农业丢掉了工业，抓了粮食丢掉了多种经营。现在机关干部大部分下去蹲点或转面了，许多原来分工做部门工作的，也搞中心工作了。在这样的情况下，部门工作如何为中心工作服务，如何围绕中心工作做好各部门的工作，也必须很好地解决。只有“钢琴”弹得好，重点突出，照顾全面，才能保证社会主义建设事业既高速度又按比例地向前发展。
    我们领导一切工作，都要做到胸中有“数”。这一方面，许多同志注意得还是不够的，对情况和问题常常摸不准数量，缺少基本的数量的分析，不懂得决定事物质量的数量界限。例如前一个时期，有些地方对劳动力使用情况就是胸中无“数”，以致在安排上不能保证农业生产的需要。我们今后必须时刻注意这个问题，不论是做政治工作，或是做经济工作；不论是搞生产，或是搞分配，都要有基本的调查，基本的分析。胸中无
  “数”，是一定要出错误的。例如，不懂群众中积极的、中间的、落后的基本数量情况，怎么能做好政治工作呢？摸不准粮食产量，不懂得国家、集体、个人之间的数量界限，怎么能搞好分配呢？工作的先进与落后，一般也表现于若干数量界限。我们要力争上游，就必须对自己的现有水平和省内外、国内外的先进水平胸中有“数”，才能提出适当的奋斗指标和措施，鼓足劲头去干。今天我们还处在阶级斗争的环境中，国际上有帝国主义，国内阶级也还没有消灭，资产阶级在政治上思想上的影响还存在。所以处理问题的时候，必须首先划清敌我、是非两种界限。属于人民内部的矛盾也要分清是阶级斗争性质的问题，还是先进与落后矛盾的问题。然后根据党的政策做正确的处理。我们省还有少数落后地区，这些地区所以落后，情况是很复杂的，除了自然条件差，困难比较多的客观因素外，主要是两种情况：一种是干部能力差或者作风不好；一种是少数坏分子篡夺了领导，阶级敌人进行破坏活动。在干部作风问题上，也有不同性质，有的是本质上基本是好的，但作风上有严重的毛病，不能正确贯彻党的政策，因而妨碍了群众积极性的发挥；有的是资本主义思想很严重，对社会主义有抵触情绪，拒不执行或者歪曲党的政策，营私舞弊，压制群众；有的是已经蜕化变质，成为违法乱纪与人民为敌的坏分子。在改造落后单位的时候，一定要深入调查，仔细分析，划清界限，区别对待。必须防止两种偏向：不能将坏分子和反革命分子当做人民内部矛盾处理，也不能将思想作风有错误的干部当做敌我矛盾处理。对于干部作风上的一般错误与严重错误，本质上基本好的与本质不好的，也要加以区别。只有这样正确处理，才可以有效地帮助落后单位转变过来。如果混淆了问题的性质，那么不但不能解决问题，而且要犯右或“左”的错误。我们对工作的成绩和缺点，也一定要有全面的认识，既抓住主流，又不忽视支流。在党的正确路线的指导下，就全面说，我们工作中的成绩总是主要的，缺点和落后面也不会没有，但这种缺点和落后面同总的成绩比较起来，仍是一个指头或者不到一个指头的问题。因此，那些在落后地方工作的同志，不要以那里的落后情况，当做全面情况，因为这样就会看不清工作中的主流，就有迷失方向的危险；那些在先进地方工作的同志，也不要把他们的先进情况当做全面情况，忽视了支流，因为这样就容易产生盲目自满的情绪。另外有的同志在解决了工作中一个突出的问题以后，往往就松懈起来，不去发现解决新的问题，似乎已经万事大吉了，这也是一种光看到一点不看全面的片面性。我们应该学会全面地看问题，克服和防止片面性。
    我们工作成绩是伟大的，党在人民中有无限的威信，但是我们没有任何理由可以骄傲。我们是不断革命论者，革命是永远没有止境的。我们国家和我省近两三年来，经过连续大跃进，经济建设的速度快得惊人，成绩很大，但是我们的“一穷二白”的境况都还没有根本改过来，我们面前还有很多困难，美帝国主义还在侵略我们，有些国家的反动派和现代修正主义者想孤立我们。敌人的目的是永远达不到的，问题在于我们自己要做好工作。我们每一个干部，特别是党委会的领导成员，一定要牢记住毛泽东同志的教导，力戒骄傲，发扬艰苦奋斗作风，继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，深入群众，深入实际，克勤克俭，埋头苦干，发愤图强，为完成当前的以粮、钢为中心的增产节约计划而努力，为建设强大的具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义祖国而努力，为实现我们伟大的理想共产主义而努力。
