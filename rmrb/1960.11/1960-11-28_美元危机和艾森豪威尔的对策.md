The serious US balance of payments deficit, which has resulted in a large outflow of gold, is not only continuing to develop, but is also intensifying. In July, the amount of foreign countries selling dollars to buy gold in the United States was $3.8 billion at an annual rate, which increased to $4.1 billion in August, $4.7 billion in September, and $5.9 billion in October. The wave of gold conversion is violently impacting the U.S. credit system. As of November 21, it had reduced the U.S. gold reserves to $17.99 billion. After deducting nearly $12 billion in reserves necessary to support domestic currency and deposits in the United States, only more than $6 billion are left to pay the $20.7 billion in short-term bonds currently held by foreign countries, which have the right to exchange for U.S. gold according to U.S. law. This greatly aggravated the dollar's credit crisis. The severity of the situation forced the U.S. President to issue an emergency instruction on the 16th of this month, requesting all U.S. foreign-related agencies: the State Department, the Department of Defense, foreign aid agencies, and the Department of Agriculture, to immediately take measures to fully rescue the precarious dollar.

The outbreak of this dollar credit crisis most clearly exposes the weakness of the American economy and finances, and shows that the dollar, which has always been called "in an unquestionably superior position" in the capitalist world, is nothing more than outwardly strong but inwardly weak. But the dollar crisis is not only a major exposure of the economic and financial weaknesses of the United States, but also an earthquake that has shaken the monetary and credit system of the capitalist world. Because almost all countries in the capitalist world, including important capitalist countries such as Britain, West Germany, and France, use the dollar as the basis for the value of their currencies. Therefore, once the dollar's credit is shaken, it may cause the monetary pyramid of the capitalist world to collapse, thereby causing great confusion.

The reasons for the outbreak of this dollar crisis are obviously related to the increasingly worsening U.S. economic crisis, the U.S.'s riddled fiscal budget, which is about to have a huge deficit, and the continued devaluation of the dollar, which has caused a large outflow of funds and evasion. But the most direct fuse is the ever-increasing U.S. balance of payments deficit.

Originally, the U.S. balance of payments deficit had already appeared since 1950. In the six years from 1951 to 1956, the deficit was about $6.6 billion, that is, an average annual deficit of $1.1 billion. The situation was already quite serious. But since 1958, that is, after the Soviet artificial satellite went into space, the United States experienced a serious economic crisis, and the international situation showed that the East wind was prevailing over the West wind, the deterioration of the U.S. balance of payments deficit worsened sharply. In less than three years, the deficit exceeded $10 billion. This caused great difficulties in international payments, and the outflow of gold exceeded $4.5 billion. If this trend continues, it will cause the depletion of American gold. The severity of the situation is self-evident. Why is the United States, which holds half of the gold in the capitalist world and is also the largest creditor nation, approaching bankruptcy in international payments? On the one hand, this is related to the fact that the economic strength of U.S. imperialism is no longer sufficient to maintain the official price of "$35 per ounce of gold," and on the other hand, it is also caused by the U.S. governments' reckless military and economic expansion at home and abroad, regardless of the financial strength of the United States.

As is well known, after the war, especially since 1950, the Washington authorities have spent 40 to 50 billion U.S. dollars in military spending every year, frantically expanding armaments and preparing for war, and using inflationary methods to plunder the people and stimulate the economy. The implementation of these policies has caused the purchasing power of the dollar in the country to fall to only one-third of the official price announced by U.S. President Roosevelt in 1934 that 35 U.S. dollars could purchase one ounce of gold. But despite the fact that the dollar has depreciated by more than half, Washington's successive ruling authorities have always insisted on this official price unchanged for twenty-six years in order to maintain the U.S.'s hegemonic position and control over the financial world of capitalism, making the dollar a unique international currency in the capitalist world, and obtaining tremendous economic and political benefits from it. However, as the devaluation of the dollar becomes more and more serious, the phenomenon of the disconnection between its domestic value and its external value has finally made the increasingly rising prices of American goods, when converted into foreign currency, more expensive in foreign markets than the goods of other capitalist countries, while the prices of foreign goods, when converted into U.S. dollars, are becoming cheaper than American goods in the U.S. domestic market. This situation is developing day by day, which has increasingly weakened the competitiveness of U.S. industrial products in domestic and foreign markets. For example, from 1946 to 1949, the U.S. foreign trade export surplus was more than $6 billion per year. In 1958, it was only $3.3 billion. In 1959, it only reached $1 billion. This greatly reduced its net income from international trade, and clearly reflects that the United States is increasingly unable to maintain the official price of 35 U.S. dollars per ounce of gold by force.

But if there were no U.S. imperialism's crazy foreign military and economic expansion, the dollar's weakness would not have been so thoroughly exposed. Because despite its inadequate strength, the United States is still a trade surplus country after all. It can obtain an income from foreign trade and foreign investment every year. Therefore, if it were not for its insatiable greed and insistence on carrying out aggressive activities in overseas military spending, capital export, and foreign "aid," it would not have exposed its paper tiger appearance so early. However, like all reactionaries in ancient and modern times, their insatiable greed and unwillingness to act according to their capabilities always lead to the opposite results. Due to the crazy overseas military expansion and the establishment of a large number of military bases, the United States' overseas military spending has been rising at an alarming rate. Before 1950, the average annual spending was 500 to 600 million U.S. dollars. In 1951, it doubled to 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. In 1953, it doubled again to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars. Recently, it has exceeded 3.4 billion U.S. dollars. This increasingly large overseas military spending obviously puts great pressure on the United States' increasingly decreasing trade income. However, in addition to military spending, the United States' predatory capital export to foreign countries is also increasing at an alarming rate every year. From 1946 to 1955, the average annual U.S. private capital export was 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, but after 1956, the average annual export reached nearly 4 billion U.S. dollars. This is an increase of nearly one and a half times. This has greatly increased the pressure on its balance of payments. Of course, the U.S.'s overseas investment income has now reached the level of 3 billion U.S. dollars. At the same time, its new investment in underdeveloped areas such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America is shrinking due to the unstable political situation in these areas and is lower than the profits it plunders from these areas. However, due to the increasing U.S. private direct investment in Western Europe, the vast majority of the profits earned are retained for reinvestment locally. This makes the U.S. private capital outflow figures far exceed the profit figures remitted back to the country, thereby increasing its difficulties in the balance of payments.

In addition to overseas military spending and private capital exports, the United States' annual enslaving "aid" expenditure of more than 5 billion U.S. dollars is also aggravating the deterioration of the U.S. balance of payments. Military "aid" for the purpose of expanding armaments and preparing for war is usually carried out in the form of "gifts," which itself accounts for more than half of the "aid" expenditure. In addition, a part of the economic "aid" that is intended to "lay a long line and catch a big fish" and carry out political control is also carried out in the form of "gifts." This further increases the U.S. balance of payments burden, making its expenditure on these three items exceed 12.5 billion U.S. dollars a year. Even if we remove the U.S.'s annual private capital overseas investment income of 3 billion U.S. dollars from it, there will still be a deficit of 8.5 billion U.S. dollars. And the U.S.'s net income from tangible and intangible trade was only 4 billion U.S. dollars last year. Even if, as Eisenhower said, the net income from trade can reach 6.5 billion U.S. dollars this year (this is actually impossible, because the U.S. President estimated it based on the unusual increase in U.S. exports to Western Europe in the first half of this year when the Western European economy was active, and this good situation has now completely disappeared. In September, U.S. export trade was already lower than last year's low level), there will still be a deficit of 2 billion U.S. dollars. In fact, due to the severity of the U.S. domestic economic crisis and the resulting distrust of the dollar and the intensification of the flight of U.S. funds (the current annual rate of short-term capital outflow is 2 billion U.S. dollars), it is estimated that the U.S. balance of payments this year will even exceed last year's deficit of nearly 4 billion U.S. dollars.

It can be seen that the factors leading to the dollar crisis are, on the one hand, that the U.S.'s economic strength is becoming weaker and weaker, and it is increasingly difficult to maintain the dollar by force; on the other hand, it is also the result of the U.S. monopoly capital's reckless foreign aggression and expansion, which has finally led to a serious balance of payments deficit. No wonder the British magazine "The Economist" recently said, "The current U.S. payment deficit is to a large extent caused by non-commercial special payments, so its future direction is unpredictable by any economist, no matter what foresight he has." The British "Times" on November 10 also said: "The weakness of the dollar is entirely caused by capital exports," "If Congress decides to reduce the aid program at any time, the U.S. payment deficit will disappear soon."

But will the U.S. ruling authorities really "retreat in the face of difficulties" and reduce its capital export and "aid" programs, or stop its overseas military spending, so that its balance of payments deficit will "disappear quickly"?

This is obviously impossible. Because this is equivalent to asking U.S. imperialism to violate its own nature and abandon its policy of foreign expansion. Therefore, although this is the simplest way to eliminate the U.S. balance of payments deficit, it does not conform to the intentions of the Washington authorities. The U.S. President made it very clear at the press conference on the 16th that he is not prepared to reduce the U.S. troops stationed abroad to the "extent that people feel that we have abandoned this area or that we have lowered our flag in this area," nor does he plan to stop or restrict the export of U.S. monopoly capital overseas, and even less is he prepared to "harm" the U.S.'s "international economic program" (i.e., U.S. "aid"), but to strengthen commodity exports, that is, to ask Western Europe and Japan and other "economically and financially strong countries to lower tariffs, relax (import) quotas," and "remove trade restrictions that hinder U.S. exports." In addition, he also wants to force Western Europe to act as a stepping stone for the United States, both to bear the costs of stationing troops for it and to provide it with sources of funds to control underdeveloped countries.

Of course, this series of wishful thinking of the U.S. President, which shifts blame to others and harms others for one's own benefit, will not have any other result than to aggravate the contradictions between U.S. imperialism and its Western European partners and further divide the imperialist camp. In the past few days, the demands made by Deputy Secretary of State Dillon and Treasury Secretary Anderson to Bonn, Paris, and London have been rejected one after another, which is proof. The U.S. government has been blaming each other for this "mission" that "obviously achieved little or no success from the beginning" and has been arguing with each other.

Of course, in order to alleviate the serious pressure of the balance of payments deficit, the U.S. ruling authorities are also trying to narrow the loophole by withdrawing some overseas military family members, reducing overseas military orders, increasing the number of U.S. goods purchased with U.S. "aid," and so on. But even Western newspapers believe that these measures can only save it 1 billion U.S. dollars in the final analysis, which is far from enough to reverse the increasingly deteriorating balance of payments deficit and gold outflow.

The Washington authorities are in a "dead end" in resolving the dollar crisis. The U.S. President's "emergency instruction" not only shows that the U.S. ruling group is determined to use the method of sacrificing its Western European partners to overcome the crisis, but it also shows that U.S. imperialism's perverse actions of digging its own grave are accelerating its doomsday.

    美元危机和艾森豪威尔的对策
    张振亚
    美国国际收支逆差的严重所造成的大量黄金外流不仅在继续发展，而且越演越烈。7月份外国在美国抛出美元购买黄金的数目按年率计是三十八亿美元，8月份增加到四十一亿美元，9月份再增加到四十七亿美元，10月份达到五十九亿美元。兑换黄金的浪潮猛烈地冲击着美国的信用制度。截至11月21日止，已使美国黄金储备下降到一百七十九亿九千万美元。其中除掉支持美国国内货币和存款所必须的近一百二十亿美元储备以外，只剩下六十多亿美元来支付目前外国拥有的、按美国法律可以有权利兑换美国黄金的短期债券二百零七亿美元。这就大大加重了美元的信用危机。情况的严重迫使美国总统于本月16日发出紧急指示，要求美国所有有关对外机构：国务院、国防部、援外机构、农业部立即采取措施，以全力来抢救岌岌可危的美元。
    这次美元信用危机的爆发，最明显不过地暴露了美国经济和财政上的虚弱，表明了一向在资本主义世界中被称为“居于不成问题的优越地位”的美元不过是外强中干，虚有其表。但是美元的危机还不仅是美国经济和财政弱点的大暴露，它也是震撼资本主义世界货币和信用体系的一次地震。因为资本主义世界的几乎所有国家，其中包括英国、西德、法国等重要资本主义国家，都是以美元作为它们货币价值的基础。所以美元信用一旦动摇，就可能使资本主义世界的货币金字塔垮台，从而引起极大的混乱。
    导致这次美元危机爆发的原因显然是同美国经济危机日益恶化，美国千疮百孔的财政预算又将出现巨额赤字，美元也跟着将继续贬值，从而引起大量资金外流和逃避有关。但是最直接的导火线则是美国国际收支逆差的越演越大。
    原来美国的国际收支逆差从1950年就已出现。在1951到1956年的六年中，逆差约六十六亿美元，也就是说平均每年有十一亿美元的逆差。情况已相当严重。但是从1958年起，也就是在苏联人造卫星上天，美国爆发严重经济危机，国际局势出现东风压倒西风的形势之后，美国的国际收支逆差恶化情况更急转直下，在不到三年的时间里，逆差超过了一百亿美元。造成了国际支付上的极大困难，外流黄金超过了四十五亿美元。这一趋势如果继续发展下去，势将造成美国黄金的涸竭。形势的险恶，是不言而喻的。握有资本主义世界一半黄金，而且也是最大债权国的美国，为什么会在国际支付上弄到接近破产的地步呢？这一方面是同美帝国主义的经济实力已不足以维持美元的每“三十五美元换一盎斯黄金”的官价有关，另一方面，也是美国历届政府不顾美国财政力量，在国内外疯狂进行军事和经济扩张造成的。
    如所周知，战后，特别是1950年以来华盛顿当局每年都要花费四、五百亿美元军费，疯狂扩军备战，并用通货膨胀手法来掠夺人民、刺激经济。这类政策的施行，使美元在国内的购买力已下跌到仅为美国总统罗斯福1934年宣布三十五美元可购买一盎斯黄金的官价的三分之一。但是尽管美元已贬值一半以上，华盛顿历届的统治当局为了保持美国独霸和控制资本主义世界金融的地位，二十六年来始终坚持这一官价不变，使美元成为资本主义世界独一无二的国际货币，并从中取得了莫大的经济和政治利益。可是随着美元贬值一天天严重，它的对内价值和对外价值脱节的现象终于使日益上涨的美国商品价格折合成外币在国外市场上的售价越来越高于其他资本主义国家商品，而外国商品价格折合成美元在美国国内市场上却越来越低廉于美国商品。这种情况一天天发展就使美国工业品在国内外市场的竞争能力日益削弱。譬如1946年到1949年美国对外贸易的出口顺差每年在六十亿美元以上。1958年只有三十三亿美元。1959年仅达十亿美元。这就大大缩减了它的国际贸易净收入，并明显地反映了美国要强行维持三十五美元一盎斯黄金的官价已是越来越力不胜任。
    但是如果没有美帝国主义疯狂的对外军事和经济扩张，美元的这种外强中干也许不会这样暴露得彻底。因为尽管实力不济，美国到底仍然是一个贸易出超国家。它每年都能从对外贸易和对外投资中获得一笔收入。所以如果它不是贪心不足，一味在海外军费开支、资本输出和对外“援助”等方面大量搞侵略活动，本来也不会这样过早的暴露自己的纸老虎相。可是，正像古今中外的一切反动派那样，它们的贪得无厌，不肯量力而行，总是导致反面结果。由于疯狂进行海外军事扩张，大量建立军事基地，美国的国外军费开支一直是惊人上升。1950年以前，平均每年为五、六亿美元。1951年增加了一倍，达到十三亿美元。1953年又增加了一倍，达到二十五亿美元。最近更超过三十四亿美元。这样日益加大的海外军事花费对于美国的日益减少的贸易收入，显然形成很大的压力。但是，除了军费开支以外，美国每年向国外进行的掠夺性资本输出也同样是在惊人上升。从1946年到1955年美国私人资本输出平均每年为十六亿美元，但在1956年以后，平均每年就达到近四十亿美元。计增加了近一倍半。这就大大加重了它的国际收支的压力。固然，美国海外投资收入目前已达到三十亿美元的水平，同时，它在亚、非和拉丁美洲等不发达地区的新投资因这些地区政治形势不稳已在缩减，并低于它从这些地区掠夺的利润，但是由于美国对西欧的私人直接投资越来越大，所获的利润绝大部分又都保留下来在当地进行再投资。这就使美国私人资本外流数字大大超过汇回本国的利润数字，从而加重了它在国际收支上的困难。
    除了海外军事开支、私人资本输出两项大宗支出以外，美国每年高达五十亿美元以上的奴役性“援”外费用也同样在加重着美国国际收支的恶化。以扩军备战为目的的军事“援助”照例是以“赠送”方式进行，它本身就占去了一半以上的“援”外支出。另外经济“援助”中以“放长线、钓大鱼”、进行政治控制为目的的一部分“援助”也是以“馈赠”方式进行。这就进一步加重了美国的国际收支负担，使它在这三项上的开支一年就超过一百二十五亿美元。即使从其中去掉美国每年的私人资本海外投资收入三十亿美元，也仍然出现八十五亿美元的亏空。而美国有形和无形的贸易净收入在去年只有四十亿美元，今年即使如艾森豪威尔所说，贸易净收入能达到六十五亿美元（这实际上是绝不会达到的。因为美国总统是按照今年上半年西欧经济活跃，美国对西欧出口不寻常的上升情况估计得出的，而这种好景现在已经完全消逝。9月份美国出口贸易已低于去年的低水平），也仍将出现二十亿美元的逆差。实际上，由于美国国内经济危机的严重和由之引起的人们对美元的不信任以及美国资金外逃的加剧（目前短期资金外流速度的年率达二十亿美元），已估计美国的国际收支今年甚至将超过去年的近四十亿美元的逆差。
    可见，导致美元危机的因素一方面是美国经济实力越来越虚弱，勉强维持美元已越来越力不从心；另一方面也是由于美国垄断资本不顾一切地向外疯狂侵略扩张，终于引起严重的国际收支逆差的结果。难怪英国《经济学家》杂志最近要说，“美国目前的支付亏空在极大程度上是由非商业性的特殊支付造成的，因此它的今后方向是任何经济学家无法预料的，不管他具有什么样的远见”。11月10日的英国《泰晤士报》也说：“美元的虚弱完完全全是资本输出造成的”，“如果国会随便在任何时候决定缩减援助计划，那么美国支付逆差不久就会消失”。
    但是美国统治当局真会“知难而退”，缩减它的资本输出和“援助”计划，或者停止它的海外军费开支，从而使它的国际收支逆差“迅速消失”吗？
    这显然是不可能的。因为这就等于是要美帝国主义违反自己的本性，放弃它的向外扩张政策。因此尽管这是消除美国国际收支逆差的最简捷的道路，可是它却同华盛顿当局的意图不相符合。美国总统在16日的记者招待会上已说得很清楚，他既不准备使美国驻国外的军队减少到“使人们感到我们已放弃这个地区或者我们已在这个地区降下我们的旗子的程度”，也不计划停止或限制美国垄断资本向海外的资本输出，更不准备“损害”美国的“国际经济计划”（即美“援”），而是要加强商品输出，即要西欧和日本等“经济和财政上强大的国家降低关税、放宽（入口）定额”，并“取消妨碍美国的出口的贸易限制”。另外他还要强迫西欧作美国的垫脚石，既为它负担驻军费用，又为它提供资金来源去控制不发达国家。
    当然，美国总统的这一系列嫁祸于人、损人利己的如意算盘，除了加剧美帝国主义同它的西欧伙伴之间的矛盾，使帝国主义阵营更加四分五裂以外，是不会有任何其他结果的。几天来，副国务卿狄龙和财政部长安德逊向波恩、巴黎和伦敦提出的要求先后碰壁，就是证明。美国政府内部已在为这个“从一开始起就显然很少或根本没有取得成功的”“出使”互相埋怨，吵成一团。
    当然，美国统治当局为了减缓国际收支逆差的严重压力，还力图通过撤退一部分海外军人家属，减少海外军事订货，增加美“援”买美国货的数量等等，来缩小漏洞。可是甚至连西方报刊也认为，这些措施归根到底也只能为它节约十亿美元，远不足以扭转越来越恶化的收支逆差和黄金流失。
    华盛顿当局在解决美元危机上已处于“黔驴技穷”的困境中。美国总统的“紧急指示”除了表明美国统治集团一心想用牺牲它的西欧伙伴的手法来度过危机以外，它也表明美帝国主义自掘坟墓的倒行逆施，正在加速它的末日的到来。
