Grasp the Main and Secondary Together, Saving Coke and Coal
Suzhou Launches Coal Conservation Competition in All Processes from Stations and Docks to Washing and Charging

Our newspaper Nanjing, November 19th dispatch: A "one-dragon" competition to save coal and coke is underway in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. From loading and unloading at stations and docks to washing and charging raw coal, employees in all processes and links from the stockyard to the furnace are making every effort to reduce coal and coke consumption and loss. Compared with September, the amount of coal charged per ton of coke decreased by 8.05%; the coke ratio per ton of iron charged decreased by 9.17%; and the city's average consumption of raw coal per ton of iron decreased by 16%.

The coal and coke saving competition started in September. At that time, the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party comprehensively inspected the loss of raw coal and coke. It was found that although the coke ratio of some blast furnaces had been reduced to below one, the raw coal consumed to produce one ton of iron was about four tons. After tracing the root cause, it turned out that there were many loopholes in the links of transportation, loading and unloading, storage, and crushing. According to measurements, the raw coal lost in the carriages, holds, and dockyards accounted for 1.2% of the coal transportation volume, and the crushing loss of coke was about 20%. Through comprehensive investigation and analysis, the Municipal Party Committee believed that there was great potential for reducing coal consumption in steel production. Then the Municipal Party Committee proposed to carry out a coal and coke saving competition movement of "two tons of coal to refine one ton of iron."

In order to solve many specific problems in "two to one refining," the Municipal Party Committee also transferred the Minister of Industry of the Municipal Party Committee, the Deputy Director of the Metallurgical Bureau, and the Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau to form a working group, which went deep into stations, docks, kiln sides, and furnace fronts to work alongside the workers and direct operations. After going deep into the front line, they created a set of systematic experiences in grasping ideology, organization, management, and accounting. After promoting this set of experiences, excellent results of refining one ton of iron with 1.927 tons of coal appeared. Then the Suzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting to promote the experience of the working group. Since then, the "two to one refining" competition movement quickly reached a climax. A "one-dragon" competition between factories, furnaces, kilns, docks, and upper and lower processes quickly unfolded throughout the city.

The vast number of workers at a railway station and four major docks in the city, responsible for transporting coal and coke, focused on the requirements of "coke is not broken, coal is not mixed, and not a piece or grain is lost," and fixed the freight locations and sites for storing coke and coal. They repaired vehicles and ships and established responsibility systems and new operating procedures such as gentle handling, flat loading, and stable dragging. The First Loading and Unloading Station is the first gateway for raw coal entering the city. Now, the workers at this station carry brooms with them, picking up coal when they see it and sweeping up coke when they see it. The nine coal transportation professional teams of this station, in order to achieve "no flying (coal ash) in the sky, no loss on the ground, and no dropping in the river," added covers to the "dragon mouth" of the conveyor, added pallets to the bottom, added baffles on both sides of the cabin, and took a day to rush to repair all the cracks and loopholes in the coal transportation carts, so as to ensure that no particles were leaked. From late September to mid-October, in twenty days, this station swept up more than seventy tons of coal and coke.

Using less coal to produce more coke and improving coke quality is the main link in saving coking coal. The coking workers of Suzhou Coking Plant calculated that in order to achieve two tons of coal refining one ton of iron, the recovery rate of refined coal and the coking rate of refined coal must reach 75%. Therefore, all types of work throughout the plant have formulated specific indicators and measures based on the requirements of "double 75," and carried out a vigorous red flag competition between shifts, kilns, and people. Since late September, the coking rate of refined coal throughout the plant has risen sharply and has now stabilized at around 78%, an increase of 5.8% compared to the average level in early September.

In the last process of the "one-dragon" competition, the steel workers vowed to reduce the original ironmaking coke ratio from above one to below 0.9, so as to ensure that two tons of coal refining one ton of iron is realized in their process. All steel plants have universally implemented technical measures such as increasing air temperature, increasing air volume, establishing a reasonable charging system, and improving crushing tools and crushing methods, and strive to make the overall coke ratio close to the level of two tons of coal refining one ton of iron.

### 主次一齐抓　省焦又省煤  苏州从车站码头到洗选入炉道道工序展开节约煤炭竞赛

    主次一齐抓　省焦又省煤
    苏州从车站码头到洗选入炉道道工序展开节约煤炭竞赛
    本报南京19日电　江苏省苏州市正在开展一个节约用煤用焦的
  “一条龙”竞赛。从车站、码头的装卸到原煤的洗选入窑，从料场到入炉各道工序各个环节的职工，都在千方百计努力降低煤焦消耗和损耗。10月与9月相比，每吨焦入窑煤量下降了8.05％；每吨铁入炉焦比下降9.17％；全市平均每吨铁消耗的原煤下降了16％。
    省煤省焦的竞赛活动是9月份开始的。当时，中共苏州市委曾全面检查了原煤和焦炭的损耗情况，发现有些高炉的入炉焦比虽然降低到一以下，而生产一吨铁所消耗的原煤却要合到四吨左右。寻根究底，原来在运输、装卸、保管、破碎等环节上都存在着不少漏洞。据测定，仅散失在车厢、舱底、码头场地的原煤就占运煤量的1.2％，焦炭的破碎损耗在20％左右。通过全面调查分析，市委认为在钢铁生产中降低煤耗的潜力很大。接着市委就提出了开展“两吨煤炼一吨铁”的节约煤焦竞赛运动。
    为了解决“两炼一”中的许多具体问题，市委还抽调了市委工业部长、冶金局副局长和交通局副局长组成工作组，深入到车站、码头、窑边、炉前，跟班劳动，坐镇指挥。他们深入现场后，创造了一套抓思想、抓组织、抓管理、抓核算的系统经验，在推广了这套经验后，出现了用一点九二七吨煤炼一吨铁的优异成绩。接着中共苏州市委召开了现场会议，推广了工作组的经验。此后，“两炼一”的竞赛运动很快就出现了高潮。一个厂与厂、炉与炉、窑与窑、码头与码头上下工序之间的一条龙竞赛便在全市迅速开展起来了。
    这个市负责运煤运焦的一个火车站和四个主要码头的广大职工，围绕“焦不碎，煤不杂，不丢一块一粒”的要求，固定了存放焦煤的货位和场地，修整了车辆、船只和轻拿轻放、装平拖稳等责任制度和新的操作规程。第一装卸站是原煤进市的第一道关口，现在，这个站的职工都带上了扫帚，见煤就拣，见焦就扫。这个站的九个运煤专业队，为了做到“天上不飞（煤灰），地上不失，河里不丢”，在运送机的“龙口”加上了套罩，在底部加上了托板，在船舱两侧加上了拦板，并用一天的时间突击把运煤小板车裂缝和漏洞全部修补好了，做到了颗粒不漏。这个站从9月下旬到10月中旬的二十天中，光是扫起来的煤焦就有七十多吨。
    少用煤多出焦，提高焦炭质量，是节约焦煤的主要环节。苏州焦化厂炼焦工人算了一笔账，要实现两吨煤炼一吨铁，必须使精煤回收率和精煤成焦率都要达到75％。于是全厂各个工种都根据“双七五”的要求，订出了具体的指标和措施，并开展了热火朝天的班与班、窑与窑、人与人的红旗竞赛。9月下旬以来，全厂的精煤成焦率直线上升，现在已经稳定在78％左右，比9月上旬的平均水平提高了5.8％。
    在“一条龙”竞赛中最后一道工序的钢铁工人们，立志要把原有的炼铁焦比从一以上降到零点九以下，以保证两吨煤炼一吨铁在自己的工序上实现。各钢铁厂普遍贯彻了提高风温，增大风量，建立合理的装料制度，以及改进破碎工具和破碎方法等技术措施，努力使全焦比接近两吨煤炼一吨铁的水平。
