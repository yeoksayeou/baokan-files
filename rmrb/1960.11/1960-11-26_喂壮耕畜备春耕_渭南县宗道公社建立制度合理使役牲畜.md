Feeding Strong Draught Animals to Prepare for Spring Plowing
Weinan County's Zongdao Commune Establishes a System for Rational Utilization of Livestock

Our newspaper, Xi'an, 25th – The nationally renowned model unit for large livestock production, the Zongdao People's Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, is taking practical measures to ensure the rational utilization of livestock, ensuring they are strong for the winter and ready for spring plowing.

Based on the characteristics of concentrated autumn and winter work and high demand for animal power, as well as the large number of livestock being bred and pregnant, the Zongdao Commune has formulated methods and systems for the rational utilization of livestock. Each team has classified and ranked livestock, and determined usage quotas. For example, during the autumn plowing campaign, it was stipulated that general livestock should plow 1.2 mu of land per day, while strong livestock should plow 1.5 mu per day. To avoid overworked draught animals, a livestock tagging system was established. Animals that have been used are tagged with a "used" tag, eliminating the phenomenon of draught animals being used continuously or grinding grain after plowing. The "three-month, three-stage" pregnancy protection system is strictly implemented for female animals (pregnant female animals in the first to third months of gestation have their workload reduced by 10% to 20%, those in the fourth to sixth months have their workload reduced by 20% to 30%, and those after six months have their workload reduced by 40%). It is also stipulated that pregnant female animals should not travel long distances, be assigned heavy work, or be whipped, to prevent miscarriage. For weak livestock, measures such as "one reduction" (reducing or stopping labor) and "three additions" (adding grass, adding feed, adding salt), as well as separate feeding, are implemented. Xinshi, Tianshi, and other management areas have suspended the use of 223 thin and weak livestock, increasing grass and feed, and providing special feeding. In less than a month, they have all regained their weight. The commune stipulates that feeders have "five rights" (the right to flexibly allocate livestock, the right to supervise users, the right to criticize those who do not cherish livestock, the right to stop overuse, and the right to refuse the selection of livestock), avoiding the phenomenon of fast animals working every day and slow animals staying in the pen every day. The system includes the stipulation that users have "three requirements" (must use livestock according to quotas, must allow livestock to rest regularly, must check livestock regularly) and "four prohibitions" (do not whip when full, do not rush when hungry, do not hit during work, do not ride on heavy carts). Through the above system, the commune thoroughly ensures that livestock have both work and rest.

While establishing the livestock utilization system, the commune also strengthened livestock feeding and management. Since the "Three Autumns" production, the whole commune has collected and stored a large amount of wild grass and corn stalks and leaves, with an average of more than 3,000 jin of grass stored per head of livestock. Sanitary systems have been widely implemented in all livestock pens.

In order to ensure that livestock have both work and rest, and to reduce the workload of livestock grinding grain, the commune installed small steel grinders on all 22 diesel engines and portable steam engines for drawing water in dry times and grinding flour in ordinary times. This can replace the labor of more than 200 livestock per day.

    喂壮耕畜备春耕
    渭南县宗道公社建立制度合理使役牲畜
    本报西安25日电　全国著名的大家畜生产模范单位——陕西省渭南县宗道人民公社，采取切实措施，确保牲畜合理使役，健壮过冬迎春耕。
    宗道公社根据今年秋冬活路集中，畜力用量大，牲畜配种和怀孕多的特点，制订了牲畜合理使役的办法和制度。各队把牲畜分类排队，分别确定了使用定额。例如在秋耕运动中，规定一般牲畜每天耕一亩二分地，健壮牲畜每天耕一亩半地；为避免耕畜过重服役，建立了牲畜挂牌制，凡用过的牲畜，挂上已用的牌子，消除了耕畜连续使役或耕完地又拉磨的现象。对母畜坚持实行“三月三段”保胎制（母畜怀胎一至三个月者，减轻使役10％至20％，四至六月者减轻使役20％至30％，六个月以后者减轻使役40％）。还规定母畜怀胎期间不走远路，不派重活，不鞭打，以防流产。对弱牲畜实行“一减”（减轻使役或停止使役）、“三加”（加草、加料、加盐），分槽喂养等办法。辛市、田市等管理区对二百二十三头瘦弱牲畜暂停使役，增草添料，偏吃偏喝，不到一月全部复膘。这个公社规定饲养员有“五权”（灵活支配牲畜权、对使役人员监督权、批评不爱惜牲畜权、有停止不按定额使役权、有拒绝挑拣牲畜权），避免了快畜日日出勤，慢畜日日守栏的现象。对使役人员规定“三要”（要按定额使役、要让牲畜定期定时休息、要定期检查牲畜）、“四不”（饱不加鞭、饥不赶路、使役中不打、重车不坐人）等。通过上述制度，彻底保证了牲畜的有劳有逸。
    这个公社在建立牲畜使役制度的同时，还加强了牲畜的饲养管理。从“三秋”生产以来，全社共采集、青贮了大批野草、玉米秆叶，平均每头牲畜贮草三千斤以上。各个畜圈普遍推行了卫生制度。
    这个公社为了确保牲畜有劳有逸，减轻牲畜拉磨的使役，把全社二十二台柴油机和锅驼机，都安装上小钢磨，旱时抽水，平时磨面。这样一天就可代替二百多头牲畜的劳役。
