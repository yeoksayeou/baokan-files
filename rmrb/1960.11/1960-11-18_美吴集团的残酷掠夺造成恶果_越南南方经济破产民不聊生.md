Recently, many foreign news agencies and newspapers have commented on the Saigon coup d'Ã©tat, which has already been declared a failure, and almost all agree that although the coup has passed, the reasons that caused the coup have not disappeared. Saigon's serious crisis still exists and is even deeper than before.

This conflict between two pro-American groups reflects the insurmountable predicament faced by the U.S.-Ngo clique in South Vietnam, one of the biggest difficulties being its irredeemably bankrupt economy.

Under the crazy plunder of U.S. imperialism and the cruel exploitation of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, South Vietnam has fallen into a state of economic bankruptcy and the people are living in misery. Factories are closing, fields are barren, unemployment is rampant, and beggars line the streets. This is the picture of South Vietnam today.

U.S. Goods Fill the Streets, National Industries Collapse

South Vietnam's already backward industry is now on its last legs. According to materials revealed by Saigon newspapers, South Vietnam now has no decent industry, only more than 2,700 small factories and handicraft workshops. Foreign capital accounts for 96% of these small industries. Because U.S. goods flood the market, national industrialists and businessmen are unable to compete, and many factories and workshops have closed down. Between 1955 and 1959, about 80% of the looms, 60% of the porcelain kilns, 90% of the sawmills and timber factories in South Vietnam were forced to close. In addition, some factories are in a state of semi-shutdown. The output of rubber products has decreased by 50%. South Vietnam used to be a major sugar-producing area, with 150,000 Vietnamese acres (each Vietnamese acre equals 5.5 Chinese mu) of sugarcane fields, and its sugar production capacity was 200,000 tons per year. However, in 1958, only 2,751 tons of sugar were supplied to the market. At present, the production of this industry is only equal to 11% of the French colonial rule period. More than 10,000 sugar factories have been forced to close.

Countless Fertile Fields are Abandoned, Former Granary Now Lacks Rice

In agriculture, due to constant conscription, forced labor, forced relocation, "sweeping operations," persecution, and the large-scale construction of strategic highways, military bases, and the establishment of so-called "agglomeration areas," countless fertile fields have been abandoned and agricultural products are decreasing day by day. According to statistics, about one-third of the rice fields in South Vietnam were abandoned last year. Although South Vietnam has always been known as the "granary" of Southeast Asia, it only harvested 2.94 million tons of rice in 1959, while the harvest in 1939 before the war was 4.3 million tons. As a result, even in some rice-producing areas, there is a severe shortage of rice. People in Saigon reflect that the price of rice is "as expensive as gold."

Large Amounts of Wealth are Plundered, Exchanged for Rags and Tattered Clothes

U.S. monopoly capitalists regard the economic bankruptcy of South Vietnam as a good opportunity to seek huge profits and are carrying out increasingly cruel economic plunder of South Vietnam. Taking rubber as an example, according to disclosures at the conference of industrialists and businessmen held in Saigon in August this year, 99% of the rubber produced in South Vietnam is plundered by the United States and its vassal states, and the selling price is reduced by two-thirds compared to the past. However, the rubber manufacturing industry in South Vietnam has to import rubber from abroad, and the price per kilogram is 13 to 16 yuan (South Vietnamese yuan) higher than in the past. At the same time, the United States uses "U.S. aid" as a name to dump a large number of surplus materials into South Vietnam. The so-called "U.S. aid," in addition to military weapons, mainly includes surplus agricultural products, daily necessities, and old clothes and rags. In the first five months of this year alone, the value of old clothes and rags imported by South Vietnam was more than four times the total value of its exports of coffee and tea (about 10 million yuan). Recently, in order to further devalue the South Vietnamese pseudo-currency, the United States decided to change the total exchange rate between the South Vietnamese yuan and the U.S. dollar from 35 to 1 to 74 to 1. As a result, the economy of South Vietnam has become even more chaotic. Due to the economic plunder of U.S. imperialism, South Vietnam's trade deficit has increased year by year, reaching 5.233 billion yuan in 1959, and now has reached 6 billion yuan, almost half of the annual budget. South Vietnam's exports have never reached a quarter of its imports.

Expanding Armaments and Preparing for War Siphons People's Wealth, Ngo Family Sucks Blood to Get Rich

At the same time, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in accordance with the instructions of their American masters, has consistently stepped up its efforts to expand armaments and prepare for war, build military airports, seaports, strategic highways, purchase military weapons, and suppress the people. Therefore, the military appropriations in the annual budget are increasing. According to Saigon newspapers, 90% of the South Vietnamese authorities' fiscal budget for 1961 will be used for expanding armaments, preparing for war, and suppressing the people. Some Vietnamese newspapers say that this budget is "full of gunpowder."

In the face of extreme financial difficulties, corruption and bribery are rampant among officials of all sizes in the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The Ngo Dinh Diem family is the most corrupt and bribes the most. In addition to squandering the people's blood and sweat in the country, they also secretly remit it to foreign banks in Switzerland and other countries or purchase real estate and plantations abroad in preparation for their future.

High Prices, High Unemployment, Old and Young Beggars Fill the Streets

Due to the above situation, prices are rising daily, the market is chaotic, unemployment is soaring, and the people are living in misery in South Vietnam. Since 1955, the prices of major daily necessities such as rice, meat, charcoal, tires, medicine, flour, and milk have generally increased by one-third to two or three times. According to recent reports in Saigon newspapers, the wholesale prices of goods in Saigon have increased by 40% in a short period of time. People's lives are becoming increasingly difficult, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people is increasing dramatically. In Saigon alone, a city with a population of about 1.6 million, there are more than 800,000 unemployed people. The "National Revolution Newspaper" in Saigon also admitted that the current phenomenon of begging in South Vietnam is more serious than in any colonial or capitalist country. In Saigon, there is no restaurant in front of which beggars do not stand, including not only helpless children and old people, but also some unemployed staff who speak French and English and beg foreigners.

Harsh Taxes and Levies are as Numerous as Hairs, People Can No Longer Endure

Not only that, but the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique, in order to barely maintain its precarious rule, has implemented the most brutal exploitation and extortion policy against the people. For example, in rural areas, in addition to expropriating farmers' land through the so-called "land reform" and purchasing agricultural products from farmers at low prices and selling them to urban residents at high prices through the so-called "cooperatives," they have also stipulated hundreds of various harsh taxes, levies, and fines. There are more than 20 kinds of formal agricultural taxes alone. The taxes paid by an average farmer's family each year amount to more than 2,000 yuan, which exceeds one-third of their annual income. In addition, fishing requires paying a "river section tax" of 200 yuan, bee-keeping tax of 50 yuan per hive, firewood tax of 5 to 10 yuan per load, sales of local products tax of 200 yuan per vehicle, tax of 150 yuan for selling a cow, tax of 5 yuan for selling a bamboo pole, and tax of 150 yuan for building a new house. Living near the forest also requires paying a tax of 70 yuan. There are even more various fines. According to the provisions of the so-called "Village Convention," a fine of 120 yuan will be imposed if cattle and sheep cross the road, a fine of 20 yuan will be imposed if a domestic dog walks out of the street during the festival, and villagers who have verbal disputes will also be fined 30 yuan on the charge of "disturbing public order." Farmers who rest after working and hang sweaty clothes on the fence will also be fined 30 yuan on the pretext of "violating sanitary regulations." Young people who go out without wearing the prescribed uniforms and applying greasepaint and powder will also be accused of "being pro-communist" and fined, and it is stipulated that repeat offenders will be punished more severely. The citizens and industrialists and businessmen in the cities also suffer the same exploitation and extortion. According to Saigon newspapers, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities' fiscal budget for 1961 totaled 14.985 billion yuan, of which tax revenue reached 9.182 billion yuan, accounting for 61% of the total fiscal budget, an increase of 400 million yuan compared to 1960 and four times that of 1955.

The lives of the people in South Vietnam have become so impoverished that they cannot bear it. Under the pressure of life, the phenomena of suicide, assault, robbery, and selling children and daughters are becoming increasingly serious in South Vietnam. Even Nguyen Ngoc Tho, the "Vice President" of South Vietnam, had to admit that the people's purchasing power has decreased by 70% compared to previous years.
