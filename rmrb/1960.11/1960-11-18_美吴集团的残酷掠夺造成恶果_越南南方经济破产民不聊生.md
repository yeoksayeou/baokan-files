Recently, many foreign news agencies and newspapers have commented on the Saigon coup d'état, which has already been declared a failure, and almost all agree that although the coup has passed, the reasons that caused the coup have not disappeared. Saigon's serious crisis still exists and is even deeper than before.

This conflict between two pro-American groups reflects the insurmountable predicament faced by the U.S.-Ngo clique in South Vietnam, one of the biggest difficulties being its irredeemably bankrupt economy.

Under the crazy plunder of U.S. imperialism and the cruel exploitation of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, South Vietnam has fallen into a state of economic bankruptcy and the people are living in misery. Factories are closing, fields are barren, unemployment is rampant, and beggars line the streets. This is the picture of South Vietnam today.

U.S. Goods Fill the Streets, National Industries Collapse

South Vietnam's already backward industry is now on its last legs. According to materials revealed by Saigon newspapers, South Vietnam now has no decent industry, only more than 2,700 small factories and handicraft workshops. Foreign capital accounts for 96% of these small industries. Because U.S. goods flood the market, national industrialists and businessmen are unable to compete, and many factories and workshops have closed down. Between 1955 and 1959, about 80% of the looms, 60% of the porcelain kilns, 90% of the sawmills and timber factories in South Vietnam were forced to close. In addition, some factories are in a state of semi-shutdown. The output of rubber products has decreased by 50%. South Vietnam used to be a major sugar-producing area, with 150,000 Vietnamese acres (each Vietnamese acre equals 5.5 Chinese mu) of sugarcane fields, and its sugar production capacity was 200,000 tons per year. However, in 1958, only 2,751 tons of sugar were supplied to the market. At present, the production of this industry is only equal to 11% of the French colonial rule period. More than 10,000 sugar factories have been forced to close.

Countless Fertile Fields are Abandoned, Former Granary Now Lacks Rice

In agriculture, due to constant conscription, forced labor, forced relocation, "sweeping operations," persecution, and the large-scale construction of strategic highways, military bases, and the establishment of so-called "agglomeration areas," countless fertile fields have been abandoned and agricultural products are decreasing day by day. According to statistics, about one-third of the rice fields in South Vietnam were abandoned last year. Although South Vietnam has always been known as the "granary" of Southeast Asia, it only harvested 2.94 million tons of rice in 1959, while the harvest in 1939 before the war was 4.3 million tons. As a result, even in some rice-producing areas, there is a severe shortage of rice. People in Saigon reflect that the price of rice is "as expensive as gold."

Large Amounts of Wealth are Plundered, Exchanged for Rags and Tattered Clothes

U.S. monopoly capitalists regard the economic bankruptcy of South Vietnam as a good opportunity to seek huge profits and are carrying out increasingly cruel economic plunder of South Vietnam. Taking rubber as an example, according to disclosures at the conference of industrialists and businessmen held in Saigon in August this year, 99% of the rubber produced in South Vietnam is plundered by the United States and its vassal states, and the selling price is reduced by two-thirds compared to the past. However, the rubber manufacturing industry in South Vietnam has to import rubber from abroad, and the price per kilogram is 13 to 16 yuan (South Vietnamese yuan) higher than in the past. At the same time, the United States uses "U.S. aid" as a name to dump a large number of surplus materials into South Vietnam. The so-called "U.S. aid," in addition to military weapons, mainly includes surplus agricultural products, daily necessities, and old clothes and rags. In the first five months of this year alone, the value of old clothes and rags imported by South Vietnam was more than four times the total value of its exports of coffee and tea (about 10 million yuan). Recently, in order to further devalue the South Vietnamese pseudo-currency, the United States decided to change the total exchange rate between the South Vietnamese yuan and the U.S. dollar from 35 to 1 to 74 to 1. As a result, the economy of South Vietnam has become even more chaotic. Due to the economic plunder of U.S. imperialism, South Vietnam's trade deficit has increased year by year, reaching 5.233 billion yuan in 1959, and now has reached 6 billion yuan, almost half of the annual budget. South Vietnam's exports have never reached a quarter of its imports.

Expanding Armaments and Preparing for War Siphons People's Wealth, Ngo Family Sucks Blood to Get Rich

At the same time, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in accordance with the instructions of their American masters, has consistently stepped up its efforts to expand armaments and prepare for war, build military airports, seaports, strategic highways, purchase military weapons, and suppress the people. Therefore, the military appropriations in the annual budget are increasing. According to Saigon newspapers, 90% of the South Vietnamese authorities' fiscal budget for 1961 will be used for expanding armaments, preparing for war, and suppressing the people. Some Vietnamese newspapers say that this budget is "full of gunpowder."

In the face of extreme financial difficulties, corruption and bribery are rampant among officials of all sizes in the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The Ngo Dinh Diem family is the most corrupt and bribes the most. In addition to squandering the people's blood and sweat in the country, they also secretly remit it to foreign banks in Switzerland and other countries or purchase real estate and plantations abroad in preparation for their future.

High Prices, High Unemployment, Old and Young Beggars Fill the Streets

Due to the above situation, prices are rising daily, the market is chaotic, unemployment is soaring, and the people are living in misery in South Vietnam. Since 1955, the prices of major daily necessities such as rice, meat, charcoal, tires, medicine, flour, and milk have generally increased by one-third to two or three times. According to recent reports in Saigon newspapers, the wholesale prices of goods in Saigon have increased by 40% in a short period of time. People's lives are becoming increasingly difficult, and the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people is increasing dramatically. In Saigon alone, a city with a population of about 1.6 million, there are more than 800,000 unemployed people. The "National Revolution Newspaper" in Saigon also admitted that the current phenomenon of begging in South Vietnam is more serious than in any colonial or capitalist country. In Saigon, there is no restaurant in front of which beggars do not stand, including not only helpless children and old people, but also some unemployed staff who speak French and English and beg foreigners.

Harsh Taxes and Levies are as Numerous as Hairs, People Can No Longer Endure

Not only that, but the Ngo Dinh Diem traitorous clique, in order to barely maintain its precarious rule, has implemented the most brutal exploitation and extortion policy against the people. For example, in rural areas, in addition to expropriating farmers' land through the so-called "land reform" and purchasing agricultural products from farmers at low prices and selling them to urban residents at high prices through the so-called "cooperatives," they have also stipulated hundreds of various harsh taxes, levies, and fines. There are more than 20 kinds of formal agricultural taxes alone. The taxes paid by an average farmer's family each year amount to more than 2,000 yuan, which exceeds one-third of their annual income. In addition, fishing requires paying a "river section tax" of 200 yuan, bee-keeping tax of 50 yuan per hive, firewood tax of 5 to 10 yuan per load, sales of local products tax of 200 yuan per vehicle, tax of 150 yuan for selling a cow, tax of 5 yuan for selling a bamboo pole, and tax of 150 yuan for building a new house. Living near the forest also requires paying a tax of 70 yuan. There are even more various fines. According to the provisions of the so-called "Village Convention," a fine of 120 yuan will be imposed if cattle and sheep cross the road, a fine of 20 yuan will be imposed if a domestic dog walks out of the street during the festival, and villagers who have verbal disputes will also be fined 30 yuan on the charge of "disturbing public order." Farmers who rest after working and hang sweaty clothes on the fence will also be fined 30 yuan on the pretext of "violating sanitary regulations." Young people who go out without wearing the prescribed uniforms and applying greasepaint and powder will also be accused of "being pro-communist" and fined, and it is stipulated that repeat offenders will be punished more severely. The citizens and industrialists and businessmen in the cities also suffer the same exploitation and extortion. According to Saigon newspapers, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities' fiscal budget for 1961 totaled 14.985 billion yuan, of which tax revenue reached 9.182 billion yuan, accounting for 61% of the total fiscal budget, an increase of 400 million yuan compared to 1960 and four times that of 1955.

The lives of the people in South Vietnam have become so impoverished that they cannot bear it. Under the pressure of life, the phenomena of suicide, assault, robbery, and selling children and daughters are becoming increasingly serious in South Vietnam. Even Nguyen Ngoc Tho, the "Vice President" of South Vietnam, had to admit that the people's purchasing power has decreased by 70% compared to previous years.

### 美吴集团的残酷掠夺造成恶果  越南南方经济破产民不聊生

    美吴集团的残酷掠夺造成恶果
    越南南方经济破产民不聊生
    最近许多外国通讯社和报刊纷纷对已经宣告破产的西贡政变发表评论，几乎一致认为，政变虽已过去，但造成政变的原因并未消失，西贡的严重危机仍然存在，而且比以前更加深了。
    这次两个亲美集团之间的冲突，反映了美吴集团在越南南方所面临的无法逾越的困境，其中最大的困难之一是它的已沦于不可收拾地步的经济破产。
    在美帝国主义的疯狂掠夺和吴庭艳集团的残酷榨取下，越南南方已陷入经济破产、民不聊生的境地。工厂倒闭、田园荒芜、失业成群、行乞满道。这就是今日越南南方的写照。
    美国商品满街是　民族工业纷倒闭
    本来就十分落后的越南南方工业，目前已处于奄奄一息的状态。据西贡报纸所透露的材料，越南南方现在没有像样的工业，它仅有二千七百多家小工厂和手工业作坊。而在这些小工业中的外国资本竟占96％。由于美国商品充斥市场，民族工商业者无力与之竞争，许多厂坊纷纷倒闭。在1955—1959年期间，越南南方约有80％的织布机、60％的瓷窑作坊、90％的锯木厂和木材厂坊被迫停业。另外还有一些厂坊处于半歇业状态。橡胶制品的产量降低了50％。南越原来是个产糖较多的地区，它有十五万越亩（每越亩等于五点五市亩）蔗田，按它的产糖能力每年可产糖二十万吨，但1958年提供给市场的糖只有二千七百五十一吨。目前这一行业的生产只等于法国殖民统治时期的11％。被迫倒闭的糖厂已达一万多家。
    无数良田都荒废　昔日粮仓今缺米
    在农业方面，由于经常不断的抓丁、拉夫、迫迁、
  “扫荡”、迫害，以及大肆修建战略公路、军事基地和建立所谓“稠密区”等等，已使无数良田荒芜，农产品日益减少。据统计，去年越南南方约有三分之一的稻田因此而荒废。虽然越南南方素有东南亚“粮仓”之称，但1959年只收了二百九十四万吨大米，而在战前的1939年的收获量是四百三十万吨。这样一来，甚至在一些盛产大米的地区也大米奇缺。西贡人反映：大米的价格“像黄金一样昂贵”。
    大批富源都掠走　换来破布烂衣裳
    美国垄断资本家把越南南方的经济破产当作他们谋取厚利的良机，对越南南方进行着愈来愈残酷的经济掠夺。仅以橡胶为例，据今年8月在西贡举行的工商业者大会上透露，越南南方所生产的橡胶每年有99％被美国及其仆从国家掠走，而且售价比过去压低了三分之二。但越南南方的橡胶品制造业却要从外国输入橡胶，价格每公斤比过去高十三至十六元（南越元——下同）。同时，美国又以“美援”为名大量向越南南方倾销剩余物资。所谓“美援”，除了军火武器以外，主要是一些剩余农产品、日用品以及旧衣物和破烂布之类。仅在今年头五个月中，越南南方输入的旧衣物和破烂布的价值，就为它输出的咖啡、茶叶的总价值（一千万元左右）的四倍多。最近，美国为使越南南方伪币进一步贬值，更决定把越南南方元和美元的总汇率由三十五比一改为七十四比一。这样一来，使越南南方的经济更加混乱。由于美帝国主义的经济掠夺，越南南方的贸易赤字逐年增加，1959年为五十二亿三千三百万元，现在已达到六十亿元，几乎占年度预算的一半。越南南方的输出从来没有达到过输入的四分之一。
    扩军备战刮民财　吴氏家族吸血肥
    与此同时，吴庭艳集团遵照他们美国主子的意旨，一贯加紧扩军备战，修建军用机场、海港、战略公路，购买军火和镇压人民，因此，每年预算中的军事拨款越来越多。据西贡报纸透露，越南南方当局1961年的财政预算中将有90％用于扩军备战和镇压人民。有些越南报纸说，这一预算“充满着火药味”。
    在财政极端困难的情况下，吴庭艳集团的大小官员贪污、受贿成风。而贪污受贿最多的是吴庭艳家族。他们除了在国内挥霍人民的血汗以外，还把它偷寄到瑞士等外国银行或在外国购置房产、庄园等，以准备后事。
    物价高涨失业多　老幼乞丐站满街
    由于上述情况，目前越南南方物价日涨、市场混乱、失业激增、民不聊生。自1955年以来，米、肉、炭、轮胎、医药、面粉和奶类等主要日用品的价格普遍上涨了三分之一至两倍、三倍。据西贡报纸最近报道，在过去一个不长的时期内，西贡货物的批发价格就上涨了40％。人民生活日益困苦，失业和半失业的人数大量增加。仅在西贡这个人口约一百六十万的城市，失业人数就达八十余万。西贡的“国家革命报”也曾承认，目前越南南方的行乞现象比任何殖民地和资本主义国家都更为严重。在西贡市，没有一个饮食店前不站满着乞丐，其中除了无依无靠的儿童和老人以外，还有一些操法语和英语向外国人行乞的失业职员。
    苛捐杂税多如毛　人民无法再忍受
    不仅如此，吴庭艳卖国集团为了勉强维持其风雨飘摇的统治，对人民实行了最残暴的剥削和搜刮政策。例如在农村，他们除了通过所谓“土改”剥夺农民的土地，通过所谓“合作社”以低价从农民手中收购农产品并以高价向市民出售以外，还规定了数以百计的各种苛捐杂税和罚款项目。仅正式的农业税就有二十多种，一般农民家庭每年所缴纳的赋税达二千多元，超过全年收入的三分之一以上。此外，捕鱼要缴“河段税”二百元，养蜂税每窝五十元，砍柴税每担五元至十元，销售土产品每车纳税二百元，卖一头牛纳税一百五十元，卖一枝竹竿纳税五元，搭起一间新房子缴税一百五十元，住在森林附近也要缴税七十元。各种罚款名目更是繁多，根据所谓“乡村公约”的规定，凡牛羊横越马路要罚款一百二十元，节日中家犬走出街道罚款二十元，村民发生口角也要被扣上“扰乱治安”的罪名罚款三十元，农民劳动后回家休息者把汗污的衣服晾在篱笆上，也以“违犯卫生守则”为借口被罚款三十元，青年人外出如果不穿规定的制服和涂脂抹粉，也被加以“亲共”的罪名而罚款，并且规定重犯者加倍处罚。城市的市民和工商业者也遭受着同样的剥削和勒索。据西贡报纸透露，吴庭艳当局1961年的财政预算共为一百四十九亿八千五百万元，其中税收达到九十一亿八千二百万元，占全部财政预算的61％，比1960年增加了四亿元，比1955年增加四倍。
    越南南方人民的生活已经贫困到无法忍受的地步。在生活的逼迫下，越南南方自杀、行凶、抢劫和卖儿卖女的现象日益严重。甚至越南南方“副总统”阮玉书也不得不供认：人民的购买力比前几年降低了70％。　（新华社河内16日电）（附图片）
