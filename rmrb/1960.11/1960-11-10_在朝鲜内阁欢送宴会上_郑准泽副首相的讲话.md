Xinhua News Agency, Chongjin, 9th - At the farewell banquet held in Chongjin tonight by the North Korean Cabinet for the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to North Korea, Vice Premier Zheng Junze of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Marshal He Long gave speeches. The full text is as follows:

Respectable Comrade He Long, Respectable Comrade Luo Ruiqing, Dear members of the Military Friendship Delegation from the People's Republic of China, Dear Comrades:

The visit of the Military Friendship Delegation from the People's Republic of China, headed by the respectable Comrade He Long, is coming to an end.

During your stay in our country, you have felt the profound friendship of our people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army towards you wherever you went.

This is a manifestation of the traditional friendship forged between our two peoples, and a demonstration of the love and respect of our people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army for the Chinese people and their army.

Your visit to our country has immensely encouraged our people in their sacred struggle for socialist construction and the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and has made a great contribution to further enhancing the militant friendship between the peoples and armies of our two countries.

Entrusted by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the comrades of the fraternal Military Friendship Delegation from the People's Republic of China, our closest comrades-in-arms who are as close as flesh and blood.

Under the banner of proletarian internationalism, the peoples and armies of Korea and China, who are closely united in the long and arduous struggle against imperialism, became an invincible force during the Fatherland Liberation War against our common enemy, the US imperialist aggressors.

Today, this traditional friendship and relationship of mutual cooperation are being further consolidated and developed in the common struggle to build socialism and safeguard peace in the Far East.

The peoples of Korea and China have both achieved brilliant successes in socialist construction.

Under the correct leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, our working people have healed the serious wounds of war in a relatively short period of time, achieved great victories in socialist construction, and are continuing to gallop forward with the spirit of Chollima towards even greater victories.

Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people are continuing the Great Leap Forward like giants and are transforming the country into a great socialist power.

The unprecedented growth of the political, economic, and military power of Korea and China, and the increasing friendship and unity between the peoples and armies of our two countries, are powerful forces in crushing the provocative activities of the US imperialist aggressors in the Far East, safeguarding peace, and striving for the great victory of socialism in our two countries.

No aggressive activities of the enemy can destroy the great strength of our friendship and unity, nor can they stop our solemn advance.

Our people, in the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will forever advance shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people.

We hope that after you return to China, you will convey the infinite love and deep friendship of the Korean people to the Chinese people.

Comrades, I wish the fraternal Chinese people and officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army greater achievements in the sacred struggle to build socialism and defend the motherland.

I propose a toast:

To the eternal friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China, to the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to the prosperity and strength of the fraternal Chinese people, to the health of the leading comrades of the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong,

To the health of Comrade He Long, Comrade Luo Ruiqing, and all the comrades of the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China,

To the health of all comrades present,

Cheers!

    新华社清津9日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相郑准泽和贺龙元帅，今晚在清津举行的朝鲜内阁欢送中国访朝军事友好代表团的宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的贺龙同志，尊敬的罗瑞卿同志，亲爱的中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团团员同志们，亲爱的同志们：
    以尊敬的贺龙同志为团长的中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团在我国的访问就要结束了。
    你们在逗留我国期间，每到一处都会感到我国人民及人民军官兵对你们的深厚的友好情谊。
    这正是我们两国人民之间所结成的传统友谊的表现，是我国人民和人民军官兵对中国人民及其军队的热爱和尊敬的表现。
    你们这次对我国的访问，无限地鼓舞了我国人民为建设社会主义和和平统一祖国而进行的神圣斗争，并且为进一步增强朝中两国人民及其军队之间的战斗友谊作出了巨大的贡献。
    我受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，谨向血肉相连的我们最亲密的战友——兄弟般的中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团各位同志致以深切的感谢。
    在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下，在反对帝国主义的长期的艰苦斗争中，紧紧团结在一起的朝中两国人民及其军队在反对共同敌人——美帝国主义侵略者——的我们祖国解放战争时期，更壮大成了战无不胜的力量。
    今天，这一传统友谊和互相合作的关系，在建设社会主义和维护远东和平的共同斗争中，正在得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    朝中两国人民都在社会主义建设中取得了光辉的成就。
    我国劳动人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的正确领导下，在较短的期间内医治了战争所带来的严重创伤，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的胜利，并且正以千里马的气势向更大的胜利继续奔驰前进。
    兄弟般的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，巨人般地继续着大跃进，正在把国家转变为伟大的社会主义强国。
    朝中两国的政治、经济、军事威力的空前壮大，以及我们两国人民和军队之间的友谊和团结的日益加强，是在远东粉碎美帝国主义侵略者的挑衅活动、维护和平和争取我们两国社会主义的伟大胜利的强大力量。
    敌人的任何侵略活动也决不能破坏我们的友谊和团结的伟大力量，更不能阻挡我们庄严地前进。
    我国人民在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中，将永远同兄弟般的中国人民并肩前进。
    我们希望你们回到中国以后，向中国人民转达朝鲜人民对中国人民的无限热爱和深厚的友情。
    同志们，我谨祝兄弟般的中国人民及中国人民解放军官兵们在建设社会主义和保卫祖国的神圣斗争中取得更大的成就。
    我提议：
    为朝中两国人民之间的永恒的友谊团结，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为兄弟般的中国人民的繁荣富强，为以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府各位领导同志的健康，
  为贺龙同志、罗瑞卿同志以及中华人民共和国访朝军事友好代表团各位同志的健康，
    为在座的各位同志的健康，
    干杯！
