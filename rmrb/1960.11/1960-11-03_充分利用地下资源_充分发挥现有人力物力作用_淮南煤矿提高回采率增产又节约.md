Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Electric Dispatch: Huainan Coal Mine workers in Anhui Province, while increasing the number of new coal mining work faces and increasing the cycle footage of existing work faces, are doing everything possible to increase the coal recovery rate of the work faces. According to statistics, the nine mines under the bureau, without increasing labor, equipment, and raw materials, simply by fully mining the top and bottom coal of the work faces and clearing up the loose coal, increased production by an average of 2,170 tons of coal per day in September compared to August, which is equivalent to adding a production mine with an annual output of nearly 800,000 tons of coal.

Since the launch of the production increase and economy campaign, Huainan Coal Mine has added 14 coal mining work faces and has generally increased the cycle footage of the work faces, so coal production has been rising steadily. In order to fully utilize national resources and give full play to the role of existing human and material resources, the mines are also doing everything possible to increase the coal recovery rate, which increases production and saves costs. In order to do this work well, under the leadership of the mine bureau party committee, the mines generally inspected the coal recovery situation and formulated plans to increase the recovery rate. The party committee secretaries of the mines took the lead personally, unified the leadership of geology, surveying, design, production, and other relevant departments, organized teams to increase the recovery rate, and tackled the technical and management keys related to increasing the recovery rate. The mines carried out group competitions in coal mining, tunneling, and other types of work groups, with the main content of increasing the recovery rate and increasing footage, to produce three more tons of coal per group per day. The mines also made supervising and inspecting coal recovery one of the tasks of underground safety inspectors, quota setters, business administrators, and coal inspectors, and established a mass coal loss inspection network.

In order to create more favorable conditions for workers to fully mine top and bottom coal, the coal mines have adopted many technical and management measures. Xin Zhuangzi Mine implemented a system of drilling exploration holes 25 meters deep along the strike and dip direction of the mining area every week, to effectively grasp the coal seam conditions in front of the recovery site. When encountering large changes in the coal seam, they promptly adopted coal mining methods suitable for the situation, so as to fully mine and transport all the top and bottom coal. Bijia Hill, Xie Yi, Xie San, and other hydraulic mining mines, according to mine pressure and coal quality hardness, stipulated the size of the recovery "docks" and arranged the interval between tunneling and recovery, to ensure that all coal is mined out and the roof rock does not collapse too early, affecting coal recovery. The mine bureau's hydraulic mining recovery improvement team went to Xie Yi, Xie San, and other mines to summarize the advanced technical experience of hydraulic mining water gun operators in increasing the recovery rate, formulated hydraulic mining coal cutting regulations suitable for the characteristics of each mine, and organized promotion in the mines. In the learn, compare, catch up, and help group competitions, the three shifts of workers mining coal on the same work face seriously urged the previous shift to mine and remove all the coal. After the workers of Yuan Qingshui Class of the first hydraulic mining area of Xie Yi Mine went to work, they found that the water gun operator Zheng Yushan of Liu Chuanwu's class had not mined some coal cleanly, so the workers of Yuan Qingshui Class took the initiative to mine the lost coal; at the same time, they sent a big-character poster to Liu Chuanwu's class after work. Since then, Zheng Yushan has always mined all the coal on the work face and moved the water gun position only when he saw rock on all three sides. The dry mining work faces also strictly adhered to project specifications and did not leave any coal behind. In terms of shoveling coal, in addition to the coal shovelers shoveling coal, the conveyor movers and prop removers also participated in the coal shoveling work while doing their own work, to achieve complete mining and shoveling. Transportation workers, ventilation workers, and maintenance workers scattered throughout the mine also carried shovels and shoveled coal when they saw it, joining in the upsurge of increasing coal recovery.

    充分利用地下资源  充分发挥现有人力物力作用
    淮南煤矿提高回采率增产又节约
    新华社合肥电　安徽淮南煤矿职工在增开新的采煤工作面、加大现有工作面循环进尺的同时，千方百计提高工作面的煤炭回收率。据统计，全局九个矿在不增加劳动力、设备、原材料的情况下，仅仅因为采尽了工作面的顶、底煤和攉清浮煤，9月份比8月份平均每天就多增产二千一百七十吨煤炭，等于增加了一个年产近八十万吨煤炭的生产矿井。
    从开展增产节约运动以来，淮南煤矿先后增加了十四个采煤工作面，普遍提高了工作面的循环进尺，因此煤产量节节上升。为了充分利用国家资源和充分发挥现有人力、物力的作用，各矿还千方百计提高煤炭的回收率，这样既增产又节约。为了做好这一工作，在矿务局党委的领导下，各矿普遍检查了煤炭的回收情况，制订了提高回收率的规划。各矿党委书记亲自挂帅，统一领导地质测量、设计、生产等有关部门，组织提高回采率小组，围攻有关提高回采率的技术和管理关键。各矿在采煤、掘进等工种小组中，开展了以提高回收率和加大进尺为主要内容的每组每天多产三吨煤的小组竞赛。各矿还把督促检查煤炭回收作为井下安全检查员、定额员、经营管理员、煤炭检查员等人的工作任务之一，建立了群众性的遗煤检查网。
    为了给工人们采尽顶、底煤创造更为有利的条件，各煤矿采取了许多技术和管理措施。新庄孜矿实行了每周在采区沿走向和倾斜方向打二十五米深的钻眼钻探一次的制度，切实掌握回采地点前面的煤层情况，遇到煤层变化较大时，就及时采用适合这种情况的采煤方法，以便把顶、底煤全部采运出来。毕家岗、谢一、谢三等水力采煤矿井，根据矿山压力和煤质硬度，规定了回采“垛子”的尺寸，安排了掘进和回采之间的间隔时间，做到既采出全部煤炭，又不使顶板岩石冒落过早而影响煤炭的回收。矿务局的提高水采回收小组，先后到谢一、谢三等矿总结了水力采煤水枪手提高回采率的先进技术经验，制定了适合各矿特点的水力采煤的落煤规程，在各矿组织推广。在学、比、赶、帮的小组竞赛中，在同一工作面采煤的三班工人，下一班都认真督促上一班采完出尽全部煤炭。谢一矿第一水采区沅清水班的工人上班后，发现刘传武班水枪手郑玉山有些煤炭没有采净，沅清水班的工人就主动地把遗煤采出；同时，在下班后给刘传武班送了一张大字报。从此以后，郑玉山总是把工作面的煤炭采完运尽，三面都见?石才移动水枪位置。各旱采工作面也都做到严格工程规格，不留煤炭。在攉煤方面，除攉煤工攉煤外，移溜子工和回柱工在做好本身工作的同时，也参加攉煤工作，做到采完攉尽。散布在井下各处的运输工、通风工、维修工，也都带着铁锹见煤就攉，卷入了提高煤炭回收率的热潮。
