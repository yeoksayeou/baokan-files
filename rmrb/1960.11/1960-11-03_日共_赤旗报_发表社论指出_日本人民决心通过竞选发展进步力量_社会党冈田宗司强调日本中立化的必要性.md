Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today, strongly condemning Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda's campaign speech on October 30th.

The "Akahata" editorial emphasized that Ikeda's blunt remarks exposed the true policies of the Ikeda Cabinet. Although the Ikeda Cabinet has repeatedly stated that it does not regard China and the Soviet Union as enemies of Japan, Ikeda admitted that his policy is a policy of hostility towards socialist countries.

"Akahata" emphasized that Ikeda admitted that his cabinet is implementing policies to revive Japanese militarism, implement a new "Security Treaty" that subordinates Japan to the United States, and regard China and the Soviet Union as potential enemies of Japan.

"Akahata" emphasized that the Japanese people should ensure that progressive forces win in the upcoming elections to deal a major blow to this dangerous conspiracy of the Ikeda Cabinet.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st, Tokyo Dispatch: According to today's "Akahata" report, the election countermeasures committee of the Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions, which has 110,000 members, met on October 28th and decided to support seven Communist Party candidates in the current election campaign.

The list of Communist candidates recommended by the steelworkers includes JCP Central Committee cadre Kasuga Shoichi, as well as JCP local organization leaders Nakanishi Isao and Tashiro Fumihisa. These candidates will be running in areas with a concentration of steelworkers.

The Federation also decided to support fifty-two Socialist Party candidates.

According to reports, the Kyoto branch of the All Monopoly Corporation Workers' Union decided to support Communist candidate Zentaro Taniguchi, a member of the JCP Kyoto Prefectural Committee. In several other places, local branches of the All Monopoly Corporation Workers' Union have also passed resolutions supporting Communist candidates.

Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd, Tokyo Dispatch: Former Director of the International Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party, Soji Okada, emphasized the necessity of neutralizing Japan at a three-party (Socialist Party, Democratic Socialist Party, and Liberal Democratic Party) policy discussion held by Tokyo Radio last night.

Okada pointed out that due to the conclusion of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Japan has assumed the obligation to fight alongside the United States. Therefore, the Liberal Democratic Party's claim that relying on the new "Security Treaty" can prevent war is a completely deceptive fallacy.

Okada pointed out that Japan can only ensure peace by severing its military relationship with the United States and implementing neutrality. Okada said that, like the Liberal Democratic Party, slandering neutrality as "fantasy" and continuing to follow the United States will turn Japan into an orphan of the world.

Okada strongly condemned the Liberal Democratic Party representative Tokutaro Kimura's slander of the Japanese people's demand for neutrality.

When the moderator of the discussion asked Kimura Tokutaro why he said that Japan does not have the objective conditions for neutrality, Kimura could not give a clear answer.

When the discussion turned to the China issue, Okada emphasized that only the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole government representing China.

Okada condemned calling the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is eking out a living in Taiwan with the support of the United States, a "government."

Okada condemned the Japanese government's shameful act of following the United States in opposing China's restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, October 28th, Tokyo Dispatch: Six thousand five hundred young people and students held a rally in Hibiya Park in Tokyo tonight, expressing their determination to fight for the victory of progressive forces in the upcoming elections.

The congress unanimously adopted resolutions and declarations, guaranteeing that the youth will use all their strength to vote out of politics in the general election politicians who support the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty". The declaration emphasized that Japanese youth will make great efforts to crush Japanese fascism.

Representatives from all walks of life in Japan spoke at the meeting. Japanese Communist Party representative Toji Kameda and "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty" representative Shigeru Oshiba unanimously called for a thorough struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese traitorous monopoly capitalist groups responsible for the assassination of Socialist Party Chairman Asanuma. Japanese Socialist Party representative Kanji Kato and General Council of Trade Unions of Japan representative Mankichi Kato pointed out that if workers closely unite with the people of other strata and wage a resolute and powerful struggle against fascism, fascism can certainly be stopped.

In Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture, more than 10,000 workers and citizens held a mass rally and demonstration tonight, expressing their support for progressive parties in the election.

    日共“赤旗报”发表社论指出
    日本人民决心通过竞选发展进步力量
    社会党冈田宗司强调日本中立化的必要性
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，强烈谴责日本首相池田勇人在10月30日发表的竞选演说。
      “赤旗报”的社论强调说，池田这一直言无讳的谈话暴露了池田内阁的真正的政策是什么。尽管池田内阁一再表明它并没有把中国和苏联视为日本的敌人，但是池田供认，他的政策是敌视社会主义国家的政策。
    “赤旗报”强调说，池田供认，他的内阁正在执行这样的政策：复活日本军国主义，执行使日本从属于美国的新“安全条约”，并把中国和苏联视为日本的潜在敌人。
    “赤旗报”强调说，日本人民应该使进步力量在即将举行的大选中获得胜利，来给池田内阁的这一危险阴谋以巨大的打击。
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，拥有十一万会员的日本钢铁产业工会联合会的选举对策委员会在10月28日开会，决定在目前的竞选运动中支持七名共产党候选人。
    钢铁工人推荐的共产党候选人名单中包括日共中央干部会委员春日正一以及日共地方组织领导人中西功和田代文久。这几位候选人将在钢铁工人集中的地区竞选。
    联合会还决定支持五十二名社会党候选人。
    据报道，全专卖工会京都分会决定支持共产党候选人、日共京都府委员会委员谷口善太郎。在其它几个地方，全专卖工会的地方分会也通过决议，支持共产党候选人。
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本社会党前国际局长冈田宗司在昨天晚间由东京广播电台举行的三党（社会党、民主社会党和自由民主党）政策讨论会上，强调指出日本中立化的必要性。
    冈田指出，由于缔结了新日美“安全条约”，日本承担了同美国共同作战的义务。因此，自由民主党说依靠新“安全条约”能够防止战争发生，这完全是欺骗性的谬论。
    冈田指出，日本只有割断同美国的军事关系，实行中立，才能确保和平。冈田说，像自由民主党那样诬蔑中立为“幻想”，继续追随美国，将会使日本变成世界的孤儿。
    冈田强烈谴责了自由民主党代表木村笃太郎对于日本人民要求实行中立所作的诬蔑。
    当讨论会的主持人追问木村笃太郎为什么说日本没有中立的客观条件的时候，木村不能作出明确的答复。
    当讨论会谈到中国问题时，冈田强调指出，只有中华人民共和国政府才是代表中国的唯一的政府。
    冈田谴责把在美国支撑下在台湾苟延残喘的蒋介石集团称作是“政府”。
    冈田谴责日本政府追随美国在联合国反对中国恢复其合法席位的可耻行为。
    据新华社28日讯　东京消息：六千五百名青年和学生今天晚上在东京日比谷公园举行大会，表示他们决心在即将举行的选举中为争取进步力量的胜利而斗争。
    大会一致通过决议和宣言，保证青年要以全力通过大选把赞成新日美“安全条约”的政客逐出政界。宣言强调说，日本青年将作出巨大的努力来粉碎日本的法西斯主义。
    日本各界代表在大会上讲话。日本共产党代表龟田东伍和“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”代表大柴滋夫一致号召同美帝国主义和应对刺杀社会党委员长浅沼负责的日本卖国垄断资本集团进行彻底的斗争。日本社会党代表加藤勘十和日本工会总评议会代表加藤万吉指出，如果工人同其他阶层的人民紧密团结，同法西斯主义进行坚决有力的斗争，法西斯主义是一定能够制止的。
    在神奈川县川崎市，一万多名工人和市民今天晚间举行群众大会和示威游行，表示要在选举中支持进步政党。
