Xinhua News Agency, November 24th, New York Dispatch: According to a report in the "New York Times" on the 23rd, the United States is dispatching a large number of ships to "visit" countries on the west coast of Africa in order to "display American naval power."

As is usually the case, the "New York Times" said in an imperialist tone that the United States wants to "establish friendly relations" with African countries through such a "show of strength."

The newspaper said that five destroyers, commanded by Rear Admiral Reid, commander of the U.S. Navy's South Atlantic Command, would "visit" the ports of all countries on the west coast of Africa. The newspaper said that approximately two thousand sailors would go ashore during the stopovers at African ports. According to the newspaper, two destroyers have already arrived in Freetown (Sierra Leone) and will remain there for six days.

The newspaper pointed out that some countries "have not yet permitted such visits." But the newspaper hinted that the fully armed "visitors" may go to ports in the Republic of the Congo.

    美国用武力恫吓西非国家
    派遣大批军舰进行“访问”
    新华社24日讯　纽约消息：据“纽约时报”23日报道，美国正派遣大批舰只到非洲西海岸国家“访问”，以“显示美国海军力量”。
    像通常的情况一样，“纽约时报”以帝国主义的口吻说，美国是要通过这样的“显示实力”来同非洲国家“建立友好关系”。
    这家报纸说，由美国海军南大西洋司令海军少将里德统率的五艘驱逐舰将要“访问”非洲西海岸的所有国家的港口。报纸说，在停留非洲港口期间，将有约两千名水手上岸。据报纸报道，两艘驱逐舰已经抵达佛利敦（塞拉勒窝内），将在那里停留六天。
    报纸指出，某些国家“还没有允许这种访问”。但是报纸暗示，全副武装的“访问者”可能将去刚果共和国的港口。
