Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok Dispatch: Under the instigation of the United States, the Thai Sarit government is stepping up the construction of airports throughout the country.

According to Thai newspapers, five strategic airports built in Chiang Mai, Ubon Ratchathani, Nakhon Ratchasima, Sa Kaeo, and Udon Thani provinces according to U.S. military plans have been completed and are already in use. Thai authorities have also decided to begin construction and expansion of three strategic airports in Phuket, Phitsanulok, and Songkhla provinces next year. In order to turn Thailand into its aggressive military base, the United States, under the pretext of "assisting Thailand in establishing a safe and effective air traffic system," is urging Thailand to build airports. It is reported that the U.S. "International Cooperation Administration" recently sent a group of aviation "experts" to Thailand to "assist" in improving Thailand's existing airports, including "assisting" Thailand in building runways, installing new equipment, and communications equipment for sixteen airports.

At the same time, the United States continues to "aid" Thailand in expanding Bangkok's Don Muang Airport.

    加强在东南亚的侵略军事基地
    督促泰国赶修战略机场
    新华社讯　曼谷消息：泰国乃沙立政府在美国指使下加紧修建全国飞机场。
    据泰国报纸报道，根据美国军事计划在泰国清迈、乌汶、呵叻、色欺和乌隆等府修建的五个战略飞机场已经完成，并已开始使用。泰国当局还决定在明年兴工修建和扩建普吉、彭世洛和宋卡等府的三个战略飞机场。美国为了把泰国变成它的侵略军事基地，以“协助泰国建立一个安全和有效的航空交通系统”为名义，督促泰国修建飞机场。据报道，美国“国际合作署”最近派遣了一批航空“专家”到泰国“协助”改进泰国现有飞机场。包括“协助”泰国修建十六个飞机场的跑道、装置新设备和通讯器材等。
    同时，美国还在继续“援助”泰国扩建曼谷的廊曼机场。
