    Xinhua News Agency, Washington dispatch: U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lemnitzer clamored in Washington on the 2nd that the United States should continue to pursue the "position of strength" policy that has long gone bankrupt.

    At the graduation ceremony of the special agent school run by the U.S. intelligence agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Lemnitzer shouted that in the face of the "communist threat," the United States and the "free world" must maintain a "position of strength."

    At the same time, the U.S. authorities are also increasing large amounts of funds to accelerate the arms expansion and war preparation activities. The U.S. Army recently revealed that the U.S. spending on the research, development, and testing of biological and chemical weapons will increase from 70 million U.S. dollars this year to 76 million U.S. dollars next year, and will increase to 200 million U.S. dollars annually in the next four to five years. The U.S. Department of Defense recently officially approved an additional 155 million U.S. dollars to accelerate the development of the U.S. "B-70" supersonic long-range bomber. In this way, the appropriation for the development of this aircraft has increased to 265 million U.S. dollars.

    军事头目叫嚣保持实力地位
    发展生物武器和远程轰炸机的拨款增加
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国参谋长联席会议主席兰尼兹尔2日在华盛顿鼓吹美国继续奉行早已破产了的“实力地位”政策。
    兰尼兹尔在美国特务机关联邦调查局办的特务学校的毕业典礼上大叫什么在“共产主义威胁”面前，美国和“自由世界”必须保持“实力地位”。
    在这同时，美国当局也正在增拨大笔款项来加速扩军备战活动。美国陆军方面最近透露，美国用于研究、发展和试验生物和化学武器的费用，将从今年的七千万美元增加到明年的七千六百万美元，并且在今后四、五年内增加到每年两亿美元。美国国防部最近也正式批准增拨一亿五千五百万美元来加速发展美国的“B—70”型超音速远程轰炸机。这样，用于发展这种飞机的拨款便增加到二亿六千五百万美元。
