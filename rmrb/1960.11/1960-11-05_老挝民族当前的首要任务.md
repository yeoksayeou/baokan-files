    The struggle of the Lao people for independence, peace, neutrality, and national harmony has greatly developed and achieved many victories. However, the situation in Laos still faces serious dangers. U.S. imperialism is stepping up its interference in Laos, instigating and supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group to split Laos, expand the civil war, and attempt to force the Phouma government to abandon its policies of peace, neutrality, and national harmony. At this time, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, once again clearly stated that the primary task of the Lao nation at present is to unite all patriotic forces to overcome the above-mentioned crisis. Prince Souphanouvong called on the Lao people of all ethnic groups and all patriotic parties to unite as one, work hard, demand that the government resolutely follow the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and direct the spearhead of struggle against the common enemy of the Lao nation—U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. This is very timely.
    The history since the restoration of peace in Indochina in 1954 has proved that the fundamental reason for the constant turbulence in the Lao situation is that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have tried every possible means to undermine the Geneva Accords and the Lao policies of peace, neutrality, and national harmony. Looking back at the many serious facts that have harmed the interests of the Lao people over the years: from openly renouncing the Geneva Accords to excluding the International Commission from Laos; from overthrowing the coalition government with the participation of the Lao Patriotic Front to supporting pro-American elements in Laos to usurp power; from arresting the leaders and members of the Lao Patriotic Front to widely implementing policies of terror and savage retaliation, cruelly suppressing the personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units and other patriotic forces, launching attacks on the former Lao Fighting Units, and even expanding the civil war to the entire country of Laos—none of these were not carried out under the instruction and planning of U.S. imperialism. And the ambition of the United States in doing so is nothing more than to turn Laos into a new type of colony and military base of the United States.
    For several years, a struggle between two paths has been going on in Laos. One is U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, who are bent on dragging Laos down the road of subservience to the United States, leading to the decline and demise of Laos; the other is the Lao patriotic forces and the broad masses of the Lao people, who are determined to take the road of domestic peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and peaceful neutrality, and to this end resolutely oppose the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, and demand that the pro-American rebel group stop any treasonous and harmful activities. The coup launched by soldiers and people in Vientiane led by Captain Kong Le on August 9 this year precisely reflects this strong demand of the Lao people.
    Now, after the plans of U.S. imperialism to use the Nosavan group to create rebellion and plot the restoration of reactionary forces have been repeatedly frustrated, it is seeking every means to step up its interference in Laos. The United States not only continues to provide the Nosavan rebel group with a large amount of money and weapons to support its activities to split the country, but also uses the name of aiding the Phouma government to try its best to obstruct the negotiations between the Phouma government and the Lao Patriotic Front, undermine the Lao government's policies of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and is prepared to overthrow the Phouma government when it needs to. The reactionary government of Sarit Thanarat in Thailand, as the vanguard of U.S. aggression and interference in Laos, has repeatedly issued calls for "taking action" against Laos, and has stepped up military deployments along the Thai-Lao border, even openly passing resolutions to directly interfere in Laos with further military action. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has decided to hold a special "discussion" on the issue of interfering in the Lao situation in mid-November, and will hold a large-scale military exercise in Thailand in February and March next year, threatening the Lao people and poisoning the atmosphere in Southeast Asia.
    Faced with the increasingly blatant aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, once again called on the Lao people to direct the spearhead of struggle against the common enemy of the Lao nation; emphasizing that the negotiations between the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao Royal Government must seek every means to unite all forces that love the motherland and peace, form a strong whole, and strive for the Phouma government to implement policies of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, to unify the country, to oppose U.S. imperialist interference, to defeat the forces of the Nosavan group, and to oppose any rebellion. The implementation and realization of this proposition will not only help eliminate the current emergency crisis of the Lao nation, but will also greatly benefit the development of the Lao people's cause of striving for peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, unity, and prosperity. The history of Laos since its independence has proved that U.S. imperialism is the most important and most dangerous enemy of the Lao country and nation. The Lao patriotic forces and the broad masses of the Lao people, in order to safeguard the national independence of Laos and defend the policies of peace, neutrality, and national harmony for which the Lao people have struggled for many years, can only unite and wage a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.
    These propositions of the Lao Patriotic Front, expressed by Prince Souphanouvong, are completely in line with the interests and aspirations of the Lao people, and have been warmly embraced by patriotic people from all walks of life in Laos. The recent establishment of the "Committee for Striving for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and National Unity" by representatives of various political parties and mass organizations in Laos, as well as non-partisan individuals, is proof of this. We believe that as long as the patriotic forces of Laos are united, they will be able to maintain peace and neutrality, achieve national harmony, and create conditions for the establishment of a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

    老挝民族当前的首要任务
    本报评论员
    老挝人民争取独立、和平、中立、民族和睦的斗争已经有了很大发展，并且取得许多胜利。但是，老挝的局势仍然存在严重的危险。美帝国主义加紧对老挝的干涉，唆使和支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团分裂老挝、扩大内战、亟图迫使富马政府放弃和平中立和民族和睦的政策。在这个时候，老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯亲王再一次明确提出，老挝民族当前的首要任务，是集合一切爱国力量来战胜上述危机。苏发努冯亲王号召老挝各族人民、各爱国政党团结成为一个整体，努力奋斗，要求政府坚决走和平中立和民族和睦的道路，把斗争的矛头指向老挝民族的共同的敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗。这是非常适时的。
    自从1954年印度支那和平恢复以来的历史已经证明，老挝局势经常动荡不安的根本原因，是由于美帝国主义及其走狗千方百计地破坏日内瓦协议，破坏老挝的和平中立和民族和睦政策。回顾这些年来发生的许多危害老挝人民利益的严重事实：从公开毁弃日内瓦协议到把国际委员会排斥出老挝；从推翻有老挝爱国战线党参加的联合政府到扶持老挝亲美分子篡夺政权；从逮捕老挝爱国战线党的领袖和议员到广泛推行恐怖和野蛮报复政策、残酷镇压前寮国战斗部队人员和其他爱国力量，对前寮国战斗部队发动进攻以至把内战扩大到老挝全国——所有这些，没有一件不是在美帝国主义的指使和策划下进行的。而美国这样做的野心，无非是为了把老挝变成美国的新型殖民地和军事基地。
    几年来，在老挝一直进行着两条道路的斗争。一条是美帝国主义及其走狗，一心把老挝拖向屈从美国、使老挝衰微和复亡的道路；另一条是老挝爱国力量以及老挝广大人民，坚决要走国内和平、民族独立、民主自由、和平中立的道路，并为此坚决反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的侵略和干涉、要求制止亲美叛乱集团任何卖国殃民的罪恶活动。今年8月9日以贡勒大尉为首的万象士兵和人民发动的政变，正是反映了老挝人民这一强烈的要求。
    现在，美帝国主义在利用诺萨万集团制造叛乱、策划反动势力复辟的计划不断遭受挫败以后，正在寻找一切办法加紧干涉老挝。美国不仅以大量金元和武器继续援助诺萨万叛乱集团、支持它分裂国家的活动，而且利用援助富马政府的名义极力阻挠富马政府正在同老挝爱国战线党进行的谈判，破坏老挝政府的和平中立和民族和睦政策，并准备在它需要的时候推翻富马政府。而泰国乃沙立反动政府，则作为美国侵略和干涉老挝的急先锋，一次又一次地发出了要对老挝“采取行动”的叫嚷，并且加紧了泰老边境的军事部署，甚至公然通过准备以进一步军事行动直接干涉老挝的决议。东南亚集团已决定在11月中旬专门就干涉老挝局势的问题进行“讨论”，并将于明年2、3月间在泰国举行一次大规模的军事演习，威胁老挝人民，毒化东南亚地区的气氛。
    面临着美帝国主义及其帮凶越来越明目张胆的侵略和干涉，老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯亲王再次呼吁老挝人民，把斗争的矛头指向老挝民族的共同敌人；强调老挝爱国战线党同老挝王国政府之间的谈判，必须寻求一切办法，联合所有爱祖国、爱和平的力量，组成一个强固的整体，为要求富马政府执行和平中立、民族和睦的政策和统一国家，反对美帝国主义干涉、击败诺萨万集团的势力和任何叛乱活动而奋斗。这一主张的贯彻和实现，将不仅有助于消除老挝民族当前的紧急危机，而且将大大有利于老挝人民争取和平中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的事业的发展。老挝独立以来的历史已经证明，美帝国主义是老挝国家和民族最主要最危险的敌人。老挝爱国力量和老挝广大人民，为要维护老挝的民族独立、保卫老挝人民多年来为之斗争的和平中立和民族和睦政策，只有团结一致地同美帝国主义及其走狗进行坚决的斗争。
    苏发努冯亲王表达的老挝爱国战线党的这些主张，完全符合于老挝人民的利益和愿望，已经获得老挝各阶层爱国人民的热烈拥护。老挝各政党、群众组织的代表和无党派人士最近成立了“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”，就是证明。我们相信，只要老挝的爱国力量团结一致，就一定能够维护和平中立，实现民族和睦，并为建立一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝创造条件。
