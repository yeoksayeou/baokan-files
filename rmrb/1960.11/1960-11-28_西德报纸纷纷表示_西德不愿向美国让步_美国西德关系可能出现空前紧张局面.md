West German Newspapers Express:
    West Germany Unwilling to Concede to the United States
    US-West German Relations May Face Unprecedented Tension

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) West German newspapers have published commentaries for days, attacking the United States for wanting West Germany to pay to help resolve the US balance of payments deficit crisis, and supporting the West German government's position of rejecting US demands in the two countries' financial talks.

    The "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" published an editorial on the 24th, saying that "the three days of financial discussions between Germany and the United States have ended without results." We regret this situation - poorly prepared talks that broke up without reaching an understanding. The newspaper said: "In terms of German-American relations, we always hope that there can be the greatest degree of understanding between each other, but naturally we cannot accept that the party in a politically weaker position must make concessions, regardless of how pressing the economic reasons may be."

    The "Süddeutsche Zeitung" stated that "the magnitude of the demands made by US Treasury Secretary Anderson has shocked the German (West German) side, which may cause the most serious tension in German-American relations since the establishment of the Federal Republic."

    This newspaper believes that demanding West Germany to share 250 million marks in US military stationing costs is "unacceptable" and even "non-negotiable."

    "The German Newspaper and Economic Newspaper" wrote: People have to admit that Anderson and Dillon came here to persuade the (West German) Federal Government to engage in financial adventures. Their unreasonable demands show how far removed they are from reality. They will also encounter this danger in Paris and London.

    西德报纸纷纷表示
    西德不愿向美国让步
    美国西德关系可能出现空前紧张局面
    本报讯　西德报纸连日发表评论，攻击美国要西德出钱帮助解救美国国际收支逆差的危机，并支持西德政府在两国财政会谈中拒绝美国要求的立场。
    24日的《法兰克福汇报》发表社论说，“德美之间三天的财政讨论已经无结果而散”。我们对这种情况——会谈准备很差，未达成谅解就散——感到遗憾。报纸说：“在德美关系方面，我们总是希望彼此能有最大程度的谅解，但是自然不能承认，在政治上处于较弱的地位的一方必须作让步，不管有着如何紧迫的经济理由。”
    《南德意志报》表示，“美国财政部长安德逊提出的要求之巨大，使德国（西德）方面感到震惊，这可能使德美关系出现自从联邦共和国成立以来最严重的紧张局面。”
    这家报纸认为，要求西德分担二亿五千万马克的美军驻扎费是“无法接受的”甚至是“无法讨论的。”
    《德意志报与经济报》写道：人们不得不承认，安德逊和狄龙此来是为了说服（西德）联邦政府去从事财政冒险。他们的无理要求表明，他们脱离现实多么远。他们在巴黎和伦敦也将遭到这种危险。
