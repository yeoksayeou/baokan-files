Xinhua News Agency, November 27th, Washington dispatch: U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Under Secretary of State Dillon, who traveled to Western Europe to beg for assistance to resolve the international payments crisis, hastily ended their lightning trip yesterday and returned to Washington empty-handed.

During their trip to Western Europe, Anderson and Dillon visited Bonn, Paris, and London, requesting that these major U.S. allies in Western Europe contribute money to help the U.S. resolve its international payments crisis. However, their negotiations in these three locations yielded no results. No communiqués were issued for their negotiations in Paris and London.

The British newspaper *The Times* reported on November 26th on the situation of their last stop in Western Europe—the London talks—stating that compared to the apparently very heated talks with Anderson in Bonn, the talks in London were slightly more intense. The newspaper urged the U.S. to exert more pressure on West Germany and to extract more money for the U.S., while at the same time pleading poverty for Britain. It stated that West Germany receives two billion dollars in gold and dollars annually, while the Americans have so far failed to obtain direct relief. The newspaper demanded that the Americans understand that "the pound sterling, which pays for nearly half of the world's foreign trade, cannot reasonably be asked to shoulder the burden that has already increased so much for the dollar."

The newspaper also said that there was in fact no reason to believe that after Anderson's failure in Bonn, he could come to London to squeeze the British.

Upon returning to Washington yesterday, Anderson and Dillon attempted to conceal the failure of their trip to Western Europe, particularly the trip to Bonn, claiming that the talks in Bonn "were conducted in a very friendly atmosphere." However, the United Press International reported from London on the same day that "the American appeal to save the dollar was rejected by West Germany and met with indifference from France," and that "it is believed that the talks in London did not seek or achieve any conclusive decisions."

A *Daily Telegraph* correspondent in New York wrote on November 25th in an article entitled "'Begging Trip' Angers America," "A wave of protest is sweeping across America today as the U.S. delegation's mission to make the Germans pay for help has failed miserably. Government officials are furious. Major newspapers are using words like 'clumsy' and 'tactless' to describe Anderson's handling of these delicate negotiations."

The article stated, "The U.S. delegation demanded that more than £200 million be paid annually to maintain U.S. troops stationed in West Germany. Adenauer's subordinates refused to pay a single penny."

### 西德激烈拒绝　法国无动于衷　英国婉言推辞  安德逊狄龙求援不成空手而归

    西德激烈拒绝　法国无动于衷　英国婉言推辞
    安德逊狄龙求援不成空手而归
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：为解救国际支付危机前往西欧乞求援助的美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙，昨天匆匆结束了他们的闪电旅行，两手空空地回到了华盛顿。
    安德逊和狄龙在他们的西欧之行中，访问了波恩、巴黎和伦敦，要求美国在西欧的这些主要盟国出钱帮助美国解救它的国际支付危机。但是，他们在这三个地方的谈判都没有取得什么结果。他们在巴黎和伦敦的谈判甚至连公报也没有发表。
    英国《泰晤士报》26日在报道他们西欧之行的最后一站——伦敦会谈的情况时说，同安德逊在波恩显然十分激烈的会谈比较起来，在伦敦的会谈可以说是稍微激烈一点。这家报纸一方面要美国多向西德施加压力，多为美国出钱，一方面又为英国叫穷。它说，西德每年收到的黄金和美元达二十亿美元，而美国人迄今却未能得到直接的解救。报纸要求美国人了解，“以之来支付将近一半的世界对外贸易的英镑，是不能够再被合理地要求来替美元担负已经增加了很多的负担”。
    这家报纸还说，事实上没有理由认为安德逊在波恩遭到失败之后，可以到伦敦来压榨英国人。
    安德逊和狄龙在昨天回到华盛顿时企图掩饰他们的西欧之行、特别是波恩之行的失败，他们说什么在波恩的会谈“是在十分友好的气氛中进行的”。但是，合众国际社同一天从伦敦发出的消息中说，“美国的拯救美元的呼吁遭到西德的拒绝，并且遭到法国的冷落”，而“人们认为在伦敦的会谈也没有谋求或取得结论性的决定”。
    英国《每日电讯报》驻纽约记者25日在一篇题为“‘乞求旅行’使美国感到愤怒”的文章里写道，“由于美国代表团要使德国人出钱帮助的使命遭到可悲的失败，今天美国各地掀起一阵抗议的浪潮。政府官员大发雷霆。主要报纸用‘笨拙’和‘没有手腕’这样的字样描绘安德逊对这种微妙的谈判的处理。”
    文章说，“美国代表团要求对维持驻西德美军费用每年支付二亿多英镑。阿登纳的手下则一分钱也不愿付。”
