(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th) In recent years, the Soviet Union's gas industry has developed rapidly. In 1955, the Soviet Union's gas extraction volume was 10.3 billion cubic meters. By 1959, it had already reached 37 billion cubic meters, an increase of 2.6 times. This year's gas extraction volume will reach 53 billion cubic meters. This development speed exceeds the development speed of any sector of the Soviet national economy.

The rapid development of the gas industry has made it possible to widely adopt gas in the national economy. Currently, Soviet industrial sectors such as electricity, cement, machinery manufacturing, metal processing, and chemicals have widely adopted gas as fuel or raw material. The metallurgy industry, which previously rarely used gas, has recently begun to increase its gas consumption and has achieved good economic results. For example, the thirteen open-hearth furnaces of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine can produce 110,000 tons more steel per year by switching to gas fuel. According to calculations, if all the open-hearth furnaces in the Urals switch to gas fuel, they can produce 800,000 tons more steel per year, which is equal to the amount of steel needed for the laying of gas and oil pipelines in the Soviet Union in 1960. The Soviet Union has also adopted natural gas on a large scale in blast furnace production, which no other country in the world has done. With the completion of the Seven-Year Plan, the metallurgy industry will become one of the largest consumers of gas. By 1965, the gas consumption in the metallurgy industry will reach 27 billion cubic meters, accounting for 21.5% of the total industrial gas consumption. This will be 70% more than the current gas consumption of the US metallurgy industry.

With the development of the gas industry, urban gasification is also being rapidly realized. Currently, eighty-nine cities and many workers' towns in the Russian Federation have been supplied with gas. By 1965, a quarter of the Soviet Union's population will be able to use gas.

The long-term plan for the Soviet Union to develop the gas industry is very ambitious. By 1965, the proportion of gas in the entire fuel structure will increase from 6.5% in 1958 to 21%, and the proportion together with oil will increase from 31% to 51%. The funds saved from this are equivalent to all the capital construction investment used to build power stations, power grids, and heating networks during this period. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the national gas extraction volume will reach 150 billion cubic meters. The thermal energy that these gases can produce is roughly equal to all the thermal energy produced by coal produced in 1958 from several important coal regions in the Soviet Union, such as Donbass, Pechora, and Moscow. According to the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government in 1958 on the development of the gas industry, within fifteen years, the Soviet Union's annual gas output will reach 270 billion to 320 billion cubic meters, an increase of eight to ten times compared to 1958. The gas industry will become one of the most important heavy industrial sectors in the Soviet Union.

The rapid development of the Soviet gas industry is based on abundant gas reserves. The proven gas reserves in the Soviet Union are 19 trillion to 20 trillion cubic meters, and the total gas reserves are estimated to be 55 trillion to 60 trillion cubic meters, which is more than twice that of the United States. Now, many new gas fields have been discovered in Kuban, Stavropol, the Urals, and other places. (Attached picture)

The continuous expansion of the Soviet gas pipeline network is one of the important conditions for ensuring the rapid development of the gas industry. During the Seven-Year Plan, 26,000 kilometers of gas pipelines will be laid, which will pass through fifteen republics and lay the foundation for the Soviet Union's unified gas pipeline network.

    苏联大力发展瓦斯工业
    今年瓦斯开采量将比1955年增加四倍
    许多工业部门应用瓦斯促进增产节约
    据新华社莫斯科14日电　最近几年来，苏联的瓦斯工业有了飞快的发展。1955年苏联瓦斯的开采量为一百零三亿立方米，1959年就已经达到三百七十亿立方米，即增加了二点六倍，今年瓦斯的开采量将达到五百三十亿立方米。这个发展速度超过了苏联任何国民经济部门的发展速度。
    瓦斯工业的迅速发展为在国民经济中广泛地采用瓦斯提供了可能。目前，苏联电力、水泥、机器制造、金属加工和化学等工业部门已广泛采用瓦斯作为燃料或原料；过去很少采用瓦斯的冶金业在最近以来也开始增加瓦斯的用量，并且取得了良好的经济效果。例如，马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合企业的十三座平炉由于改用瓦斯燃料，每年可以多生产十一万吨钢，据计算，如果乌拉尔所有的平炉都改用瓦斯燃料，每年就可以多生产八十万吨钢，即等于1960年苏联敷设瓦斯和石油管所需要的钢的数量。苏联在高炉生产中也已大规模采用天然瓦斯，世界上还没有哪一个国家做到了这一点。随着七年计划的完成，冶金业将成为瓦斯的最大消费者之一，到1965年，冶金业中的瓦斯用量，将达到二百七十亿立方米，占全部工业瓦斯用量的21.5％。这将比美国冶金业目前瓦斯用量多70％。
    随着瓦斯工业的发展，城市瓦斯化也在迅速实现。目前俄罗斯联邦已有八十九座城市和许多工人镇得到了瓦斯的供应。到1965年，苏联全国四分之一的居民都可以使用瓦斯。
    苏联发展瓦斯工业的远景计划是很宏伟的。到1965年，瓦斯在整个燃料中的比重将由1958年的6.5％增加到21％，而同石油一起所占的比重将由31％增加到51％，从中节约下来的资金相当于在这一时期中用来建设发电站、电力网和供热网的全部基本建设投资。到七年计划末，全国瓦斯的开采量将达到一千五百亿立方米，这些瓦斯所能产生的热能大约等于苏联几个重要煤区——顿巴斯、彼乔拉和莫斯科等煤区1958年出产的煤所产生的全部热能。根据苏共中央和苏联政府1958年关于发展瓦斯工业的决议，在十五年内苏联的瓦斯年产量将达二千七百到三千二百亿立方米，即比1958年增加八倍到十倍。瓦斯工业将成为苏联极重要的重工业部门之一。
    苏联瓦斯工业的飞速发展是有丰富的瓦斯储量为基础的。苏联已勘察到的瓦斯的储量为十九万亿到二十万亿立方米，瓦斯的总储量估计为五十五万亿到六十万亿立方米，比美国要多一倍。现在，库班、斯塔夫罗波尔、乌拉尔等地都发现了许多新的瓦斯矿。（附图片）
    苏联瓦斯管网的不断扩大，是保证瓦斯工业迅速发展的重要条件之一。在七年计划期间将敷设二万六千公里的瓦斯管，它们将穿过十五个加盟共和国，并将为苏联的统一瓦斯管网打下基础。图为正在敷设中的从克拉斯诺达尔边区到谢尔普霍夫的瓦斯管。　塔斯社稿（新华社发）
