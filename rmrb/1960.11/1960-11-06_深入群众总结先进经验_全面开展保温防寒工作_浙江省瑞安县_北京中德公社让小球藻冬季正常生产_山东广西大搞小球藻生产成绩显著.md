This newspaper reports from Hangzhou on the 5th: Rui'an County, Zhejiang Province, is carrying out a mass winter chlorella breeding campaign.

In order to maintain large-scale normal production of chlorella in winter, the Rui'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a working group, adopting a method combining leadership, technicians, and commune members, and summarized the experiences of the county-run livestock and poultry breeding farm and the Feiyunjiang Farm last winter in adopting indoor insulation, using fermented manure, heating with fire, and mixing with boiling water to ensure normal large-scale chlorella breeding in winter. These experiences are mainly: ① Increasing the depth of the algae pond water (the culture solution should be 35 to 40 centimeters deep in the pond) to make it difficult for heat to dissipate. ② Building windbreaks to prevent cold winds from directly blowing on the algae ponds and lowering the temperature. ③ Using unfermented organic fertilizer (manure) to adjust the culture solution, so that the manure ferments in the algae pond to generate heat. ④ Cultivating local algae strains with strong cold resistance, fast reproduction, and high yield. ⑤ Using natural spring water to culture chlorella. ⑥ Stirring more when the sun shines to increase its temperature, and stirring less on cloudy days and evenings to prevent heat dissipation. ⑦ Changing the harvesting method and retaining more algae seeds. Each time, when harvesting, leaving one-third of the growth solution as algae seeds to speed up reproduction. ⑧ Utilizing factory waste steam or warm water for heating. ⑨ Fully utilizing wooden barrels and tanks as culture ponds, moving them out to bask in the sun when the weather is good, and moving them indoors when the weather is cold.

On the basis of summarizing experience, the Rui'an County Party Committee convened a meeting of livestock secretaries from various communes, and deployed the comprehensive launch of insulation and cold protection work, vigorously promoting the winter chlorella breeding campaign. It is required that each pig can eat three to five catties of chlorella concentrate solution every day in winter.

This newspaper reports that the Zhongde (China-Germany) Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing is taking effective measures to solve the problem of winter chlorella production before the arrival of severe winter. According to the characteristic that chlorella growth stagnates when the temperature is below 10 degrees Celsius, the Commune Party Committee, after entering September, continuously deployed the winter production of chlorella, requiring all eight pig farms in the commune to take active measures to ensure that the chlorella culture ponds can often maintain 25 to 35 degrees Celsius to adapt to the normal growth of chlorella in winter. The measures currently taken by various pig farms are: adding simple sheds on some open-air culture ponds to change open-air production to indoor production; when the water temperature drops, preparing to use the waste steam generated by the pig farm's feed processing boiler to inject into the culture ponds to maintain the water temperature required for chlorella growth. In addition, in the case of shortening sunshine hours in winter, various pig farms have also prepared electric lights or calcium carbide lamps to increase light.

Now, a high tide of preparations for wintering chlorella has been set off in all livestock farms of the commune. Simple sheds for seven pig farms have been basically prepared. More than a dozen chlorella production technicians from the commune are also exploring technical problems in winter management.

This newspaper reports from Jinan on the 5th: Shandong has vigorously developed chlorella production and achieved remarkable results.

In June of this year, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial on-site meeting on chlorella in Zibo City, promoting the experience of leaders at all levels in the city personally taking action, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and relying on self-reliance to vigorously develop chlorella production, which enabled many areas in the province to quickly launch a mass chlorella production campaign. Penglai has established more than 600 chlorella production ponds in more than 500 units including communes, organs, and schools throughout the county, so that more than 30% of the pigs in the county often eat chlorella. Zibo Prefecture has more than 60,000 pigs and many poultry that often eat chlorella, saving a large amount of refined feed.

Another experience for the rapid and widespread promotion of chlorella production in Shandong is to use the feeding team as the backbone, the feeding farm as the position, build farms on the spot, mainly use indigenous methods, and mainly use small-scale methods to solve the shortage of raw materials for pond construction and chemical reagents for cultivating chlorella original solution. Wudi County did not have foreign ash in the construction of the pond, so it replaced it with furnace ash, lime, and clay "ternary soil." Changwei Prefecture has established 3,100 pig farms with chlorella production ponds, most of which are also built with "ternary soil." As the climate turns cold, many areas in Shandong are actively preparing greenhouses, and further mobilizing the masses to use all available containers such as basins, jars, and cans to ensure that chlorella can also be produced normally in winter.

This newspaper reports from Nanning on the 5th: Guangxi has taken various measures to vigorously propagate chlorella. From the prefecture committee to the commune party committee, the Baise area has generally established leading groups and offices, strengthening leadership at all levels. The secretaries of the party committees in many areas personally experimented with cultivation. In Quanzhou County alone, 18 commune party committee secretaries, 81 brigade party branch secretaries, and more than 200 brigade leaders took the lead in conducting experiments, which vigorously promoted chlorella production. In order to make chlorella production quickly form a mass movement, party committees at all levels also adopted methods such as running training classes, holding on-site meetings, and learning from other places to break through technical barriers. From April, Guilin Prefecture has trained more than 2,000 technicians through short-term training and other forms. (Attached picture)

    浙江省瑞安县  北京中德公社让小球藻冬季正常生产
    山东广西大搞小球藻生产成绩显著
    本报杭州5日电　浙江瑞安县开展群众性的冬季繁殖小球藻运动。
    为保持冬季小球藻大面积正常生产，中共瑞安县委组织了工作组，采取领导、技术员、社员三结合的方法，总结了县营畜禽良种场和飞云江农场去冬采取室内保温，利用栏肥发酵、烤火、开水冲拌等加温办法，保证冬季小球藻繁殖照常大面积生产的经验。这些经验主要是：①增加藻池水的深度（培养液在池内深处三十五至四十厘米为宜）使热量不易散发。②搭好防风屏障，防止冷风直吹藻池降低温度。③采用未腐熟的有机质肥料（栏肥）调剂培养液，使栏肥在藻池中发酵产生热量。④培养抗寒力强、繁殖快、产量高的本地藻种。⑤利用天然泉水培养小球藻。⑥太阳照射时多搅拌，以增加它的温度，阴天和傍晚少搅拌，以防止热量散发。⑦改变收获方法，多留藻种。每次采收时，留放三分之一生长液作为藻种，以加快繁殖力。⑧利用工厂废蒸气或温水加温。⑨充分利用木桶和缸作培养池，天气好时搬出晒太阳，天气冷时移进室内。
    在总结经验的基础上，瑞安县委召开了各公社畜牧书记会议，部署全面开展保温防寒工作，大搞冬季繁殖小球藻运动。要求每头生猪冬季每天都能吃到三至五斤小球藻浓缩液。
    本报讯　北京郊区中德友好人民公社在严冬到来之前，采取有效措施，解决小球藻越冬生产问题。根据小球藻在气温摄氏十度以下生长就要停滞的特点，公社党委进入9月以后，就连续布置了小球藻的越冬生产工作，要求全社八个猪场采取积极措施，使小球藻培养池能够经常保持摄氏二十五至三十五度，以适应小球藻在冬季正常生长。现在各个猪场采取的措施是：在一部分露天培养池上加盖简单的罩棚，变露天生产为室内生产；在水温下降时，准备利用猪场加工饲料的锅驼机产生的废汽，通入培养池中以保持小球藻生长所需要的水温。此外，在冬季光照时间缩短的情况下，各猪场还准备了电灯或电石灯以增加光照。
    现在，全公社各畜牧场，掀起了小球藻越冬准备工作的高潮。七个猪场的简易罩棚已经大体准备就绪。公社的十多名小球藻生产技术人员也正在探索冬季管理技术上的问题。
    本报济南5日电　山东各地大搞小球藻生产，取得了显著成绩。
    今年6月，中共山东省委在淄博市召开了全省小球藻现场会议，推广了这个市各级领导亲自动手，土洋并举，自力更生大搞小球藻生产的经验，使全省许多地区迅速开展起一个群众性的小球藻生产运动。蓬莱在全县各公社和机关、学校等五百多个单位中建立小球藻生产池六百多个，使全县30％以上的猪经常吃上小球藻。淄博专区已有六万多头猪和许多家禽经常吃上小球藻，节省了大批精饲料。
    山东各地小球藻生产获得迅速广泛推广的另一条经验，是以饲养队伍为骨干，饲养场为阵地，就地建场，土法为主，小型为主，解决建池原料和培殖小球藻原液化学药品的不足。无棣县在建池中没有洋灰，就用炉灰、石灰、粘土“三合土”代替。昌潍专区已有三千一百处养猪场建立小球藻生产池，其中大部分也是用“三合土”建成的。随着气候的转冷，山东许多地区正积极准备暖房、温室和进一步发动群众，利用一切可以利用的盆、缸、罐等容器，以保证在冬季小球藻也能正常进行生产。
    本报南宁5日电　广西各地采取各种办法大力繁殖小球藻。百色地区从地委直到公社党委，普遍成立了领导小组和办公室，层层加强领导。许多地区的党委书记动手试验培育。全州县就有十八个公社党委书记，八十一个大队党支部书记和二百多个大队长带头搞试验，有力地推动了小球藻生产。为了使小球藻生产迅速形成群众运动，各级党委还采取办训练班、开现场会，向外地学习等办法，突破技术关。桂林专区各县从4月开始，通过开训练班进行短期训练等形式，先后培训了两千多名技术员。（附图片）
