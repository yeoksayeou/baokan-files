Guilin City Seven Machinery Factories’ Leading Cadres and Technicians Go to the Countryside to Help County and Commune Factories Improve Production Capacity

(Our report) According to the Guangxi Daily news, more than 50 leading cadres and technical workers from seven machinery factories in Guilin City, Guangxi Province, visited the county and commune machinery factories (agricultural machinery factories) they were paired with from October 25 to early November. They assisted in solving key production problems, promoting the development of these county and commune factories, and better supporting agricultural production.

During these visits, the factory workers insisted on "four togethers" with the workers of the county and commune factories, and quickly helped the factories to overcome many key production issues. The deputy director of the Guilin Valve Factory led two technicians to the Longsheng Various Nationalities Autonomous County Machinery Factory to help the factory install a pig iron furnace and a blower. On October 31, they broke through the technical barrier of converting white cast iron to gray cast iron. This solved the key problem that the factory had long faced in being unable to sand cast many machine parts, ensuring the complete production of some agricultural machinery products. When Quanzhou County Machinery Factory was producing silk and slice cutting machines, the inability to convert white cast iron to gray cast iron made it impossible to process the sleeve on the silk cutting machine, affecting the complete production of the silk cutting machine. This time, the deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Guilin Machine Tool Factory, along with the head of the technology section and a veteran foundry worker, went deep into the site to guide the work, using local anthracite coal as fuel to melt the gray cast iron and complete the sand casting of the sleeve.

During this visit, the workers of various machinery factories in Guilin City also assisted the county and commune machinery factories (agricultural machinery factories) in solving technical difficulties in the repair and installation of mechanical equipment. Many factories had difficulties in repairing broken machine tools due to technical problems, and some machines could not be put into production after being transported to the factory because they did not know how to install them. The workers of the seven factories repaired and installed a total of 21 machine tools and power equipment for the county and commune machinery factories (agricultural machinery factories) this time.

In order to help county and commune machinery factories (agricultural machinery factories) improve their technical level and strengthen enterprise management, the workers of Guilin Machine Tool Factory taught advanced tool grinding methods, machine tool maintenance knowledge, and new casting modeling techniques to the machinery factories in Quanzhou and Yongfu counties respectively. The workers of Guilin Machinery Factory helped Guanyang County Machinery Factory design the process routes for the machine shop and forging shop, which can save a batch of labor.

    桂林市七个机械厂领导干部和技术人员下乡
    帮助县社工厂提高生产能力
    本报讯　据广西日报消息　广西省桂林市七个机械厂领导干部和技术工人共五十多人，于10月25日至11月初，分别到他们挂钩的县社机械厂（农械厂）访问，协助解决生产中的关键问题，促进了这些县社工厂生产的发展，更好地支援了农业生产。
    这些工厂的职工在下乡访问中，坚持与县社各厂的职工实行“四同”，因而很快就协助各厂攻破了许多生产关键。桂林阀门厂的副厂长带领二名技工到龙胜各族自治县机械厂，帮助这个厂安装好一座化铁炉和鼓风机，在10月31日突破了白口铁变灰口铁的技术关，解决了这个厂长期以来许多机器零件无法翻砂铸造的关键，保证了一些农业机械产品成套出厂。全州县机械厂在生产切丝切片机的时候，由于白口铁变灰口铁的技术关未过，致使切丝机上的套筒无法加工，影响到切丝机的成台出厂。这次桂林机床厂的党委副书记，带领了技术科长和铸工老师傅深入现场指导，采用当地的白煤作燃料，化出了灰口铁，完成了套筒的翻砂任务。
    在这次访问中，桂林市各机械厂职工还协助各县社机械厂（农械厂）解决在修理和安装机械设备中的技术困难。许多厂由于技术方面的困难，机床坏了不能修理，有些机器设备运到厂后不会安装，不能投入生产。七个厂的职工这次为各县社机械厂（农械厂）修理和安装好的机床及动力设备共达二十一台。
    为了帮助县、社机械厂（农械厂）提高技术水平和加强企业管理，桂林机床厂的职工分别在全州、永福两县的机械厂传授了先进刀具磨刀法、机床保养知识、铸工造型新工艺等技术经验。桂林机械厂的职工帮助灌阳县机械厂设计了机工和锻工车间的工艺路线，可以节约一批劳动力。
