    Commemorating the Great Proletarian Revolutionary Teacher Engels
    Li Wen

    November 28th of this year marks the 140th anniversary of the birth of Engels, one of the founders of scientific socialism, and a great proletarian fighter and teacher.

    Engels' immortal achievement lies in the fact that he, together with Marx, founded the scientific theory of socialism, thus opening a new era in the world's workers' movement.

    Lenin called Engels "the most outstanding scholar in the entire civilized world and the teacher of the modern proletariat" after Marx's death. Like Marx, Engels was a brilliant scientific giant with astonishingly broad knowledge, proficient in the history of the development of nature and human society; at the same time, he was a dauntless revolutionary fighter with the great revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit of the proletariat. Engels' life was a model of a proletarian revolutionary and thinker.

    Marxism is the revolutionary science of the proletariat because it correctly answers the questions raised by the proletarian revolution.

    The liberation of the working class can only rely on the struggle of the working class itself, and only by relying on the working class uniting with the laboring peasants and other laboring people, and uniting with other oppressed people, in different revolutionary periods to carry out a common struggle. Marx and Engels pointed out such a path for us. On this path for the proletariat to strive for its own liberation, it is necessary to overcome numerous obstacles and overcome opportunistic tendencies. Engels' life is a great example of adhering to principles and fighting against all kinds of opportunism.

    What is opportunism? Engels pointedly pointed out: "Forgetting fundamental long-term goals for the sake of temporary immediate interests, seeking only momentary achievements regardless of the consequences, and sacrificing the future of the movement for the present, this approach may be out of 'sincere' motives. But this is opportunism, always opportunism, and 'sincere' opportunism may be more dangerous than all other opportunism." As everyone knows, Bernstein had a notorious formula called "The movement is everything, the ultimate goal is nothing." Opportunists attempt to make the working class lose its direction of struggle and deviate from the revolutionary path in this way.

    To struggle against opportunist trends of thought, both large and small, has always been the task of Marxists, and the focus of this struggle is precisely on the fundamental issue of revolution, namely the issue of state power, and the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Engels' discussion of the draft program of the German Social Democratic Party in 1891 highlighted this point. In the preparatory materials for the book "State and Revolution," Lenin summarized the main content of Engels' criticism of the political requirements section of this draft program as follows: (1) He directly fought against opportunism, pointing out the growth of opportunism within the party, believing it to be "a forgetting of the huge, great, major (contrast) 'viewpoints'"; (2) He reiterated the definition of "dictatorship of the proletariat"; (3) He insisted on establishing a republic (as a "special form of the dictatorship of the proletariat"); (4) He insisted on abolishing all state-appointed officials in local autonomous bureaus; (5) He opposed the illusion of only taking the peaceful path and only taking the legal path.

    Among all the parties of the Second International, only the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party adopted a program in 1903 that explicitly proposed the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which should be attributed to the struggle of Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Lenin was the inheritor and developer of the teachings of Marx and Engels. The opportunists of the Second International tampered with the teachings of Marx and Engels, especially their teachings on the dictatorship of the proletariat, in order to castrate the revolutionary essence of Marxism. In his great work "State and Revolution," Lenin cited the analysis of the state issue in a series of Engels' works, exposing the truth of the Second International's opportunists distorting Marxism, and restoring the original revolutionary appearance of Marxism. Lenin called Engels' preface to the third edition of "The Civil War in France" "the highest achievement of Marxism on the state issue."

    Engels was a great internationalist. He stood on the position of the revolutionary interests of the world's proletariat and made many brilliant discussions on important issues in international life. He pointed out that socialist societies will never wage any aggressive wars, but when it is necessary to defend themselves with weapons, the members of this society "will definitely defend the true motherland, the true homeland," and they will "fight with vigor and bravery, causing modern armies trained in mechanization to retreat in panic." He called on socialists in all countries to fight to maintain peace. At the same time, he said: "Only when the people of all European countries become the true masters of their own countries will there be genuine international cooperation among the people of these countries."

    Engels was an extremely sincere friend of the Chinese people. He enthusiastically followed the changes in China and supported the struggle of the Chinese people. Engels and Marx both published current commentaries on Chinese issues in the "New York Daily Tribune." In the article "Persia and China" (1857), Engels pointed out the just nature of the Chinese people's war and denounced the piratical behavior and deceptive propaganda of British imperialism. He said: "We had better not propagate the terrible atrocities of the Chinese people like the chivalrous British newspapers, but admit that this is a war for their own survival, a people's war seeking to preserve the Chinese nation." The Chinese people's national liberation struggle shows that "the oldest empire in the world is struggling to its death, and at the same time it is the dawn of a new era in the whole of Asia."

    From the time he became a scientific communist until his death, Engels was always full of the proletarian revolutionary fighting will. Like Marx, he always combined a firm revolutionary spirit with a rigorous scientific spirit.

    When proletarian parties decide on their revolutionary strategy and tactics, they must take the dialectical materialist world view as a prerequisite and objectively consider the stage of social development and the various conditions such as the interrelationships of various classes. Engels was a great strategist of the proletariat. He always stood on a firm principled position in all struggles, and at the same time, showed great flexibility. Engels was not only dared to fight, but also good at fighting. He was proficient in proletarian revolutionary tactics. In this regard, he not only waged an irreconcilable struggle against right-wing opportunism, but also sharply criticized those "who treat revolution as a child's play," reject necessary legal struggles, and are obsessed with the "left"-leaning opportunistic views of revolutionary empty talk.

    The victory of Marx and Engels' revolutionary theory is irresistible. When Marx and Engels wrote the "Communist Manifesto," there were only two of them, and only a very few people accepted their teachings, but they were full of confidence in the victory of socialism throughout the world and showed a high degree of contempt for the old capitalist world. The "Communist Manifesto" ends with this heroic sentence filled with the spirit of revolutionary heroism: "Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose in this revolution but their chains. They have a world to win." In his later years, Engels once said to the cheering masses: "Even if I have made some contributions to the movement I participated in for fifty years, I do not want any reward. The best reward for me is you. My reward is the whole world! ... We people are a great power that shocks the whole world, a power that can determine everything more than other powers. This is what makes me proud!" Now, there are already tens of millions of communists in the world, the socialist countries in the world already occupy a quarter of the world's land and a third of the population, the strength of the socialist camp has surpassed the strength of the imperialist camp, the strength of national liberation has surpassed the strength of colonialism, the strength of the people has surpassed the strength of reaction, and the strength of peace has surpassed the strength of war: In a word, the East wind has prevailed over the West wind. How happy would Marx and Engels be if they could live to see all this today! Striving to study the theories of Marx and Engels, opposing all kinds of opportunism, and intensifying the struggle for world peace, national liberation, people's democracy, and socialism is the best reward we can give to our revolutionary teachers.

    纪念伟大的无产阶级革命导师恩格斯
    理文
    今年十一月二十八日是科学社会主义的创始人之一，伟大的无产阶级战士和导师恩格斯诞生一百四十周年的日子。
    恩格斯的不朽功绩，在于他和马克思一起创立了科学的社会主义理论，从而开辟了世界工人运动的新纪元。
    列宁把恩格斯称为在马克思逝世以后“整个文明世界最卓越的学者和现代无产阶级的导师”。同马克思一样，恩格斯是一个天才的科学巨匠，具有惊人的渊博学识，精通自然和人类社会发展的历史；同时，他又是一个大无畏的革命战士，具有伟大的无产阶级的革命气概和战斗精神。恩格斯的一生是一个无产阶级的革命家和思想家的典范。
    马克思主义是无产阶级的革命科学，因为它正确地回答了无产阶级革命所提出来的问题。
    工人阶级的解放，只有依靠工人阶级自己的斗争，只有依靠工人阶级在不同的革命时期联合劳动农民和其他劳动人民，联合其他被压迫的人民，进行共同的斗争。马克思和恩格斯正是给我们指明了这样一条道路。在无产阶级争取自己解放的这条道路上，必须克服重重的障碍，克服机会主义的倾向。恩格斯的一生，是坚持原则、同形形色色的机会主义作斗争的伟大榜样。
    什么是机会主义？恩格斯一针见血地指出：“为了眼前暂时的利益而忘记根本大计，只图一时的成就而不顾后果，为了目前而牺牲未来的运动，这种做法也许是出于‘真诚的’动机。但这是机会主义，始终是机会主义，而且‘真诚的’机会主义也许比其他一切机会主义更危险。”大家知道，伯恩斯坦有一个臭名昭著的公式，叫做“运动就是一切，最终目的是没有的”。机会主义者就是这样地企图使工人阶级迷失斗争的方向，脱离革命的轨道。
    同大大小小的机会主义思潮作斗争，一直是马克思主义者的任务，而这个斗争的焦点正是在革命的根本问题即国家政权问题上，在无产阶级专政的问题上。恩格斯在1891年对德国社会民主党的纲领草案的论述，曾经突出地说明了这一点。列宁在为《国家与革命》一书所做的准备材料中，把恩格斯对于这个纲领草案的政治要求部分的批判的主要内容概述如下：（一）直接和机会主义进行了斗争，指出机会主义在党内的增长，认为它是“对于巨大的、伟大的、主要的（对比关系）‘观点’的遗忘”；（二）再度叙述了“无产阶级专政”的定义；（三）坚持成立（作为“无产阶级专政的特殊形式”的）共和国；（四）坚持取消地方自治局中一切由国家任命的官吏；（五）反对只走和平道路、只走合法道路的幻想。
    在第二国际的所有政党中，只有俄国社会民主工党在1903年通过了明确提出无产阶级专政问题的纲领，这应该归功于列宁和布尔什维克的斗争。列宁是马克思和恩格斯的学说的继承者和发展者。第二国际的机会主义者篡改马克思、恩格斯的学说，特别是篡改他们关于无产阶级专政的学说，以便达到阉割马克思主义的革命实质的目的。列宁在《国家与革命》这部伟大的著作中，曾经引证了恩格斯一系列著作中关于国家问题的分析，揭穿了第二国际机会主义者歪曲马克思主义的真相，恢复了马克思主义的原来的革命面貌。列宁把恩格斯为《法兰西内战》第三版所写的序言，称之为“马克思主义在国家问题上的最高成就”。
    恩格斯是一个伟大的国际主义者，他站在世界无产阶级的革命利益的立场上，对于国际生活中的重要问题作了许多精辟的论述。他指出，社会主义社会决不会进行任何侵略性的战争，可是在需要用武器自卫的时候，这个社会的成员“一定会保卫真正的祖国、真正的家园”，他们将“精神焕发、坚毅勇敢地作战，使受过机械化训练的现代军队也要望风披靡”。他号召一切国家的社会主义者为维护和平而斗争。同时他说：“只有当欧洲各国人民都成为自己国家真正的主人时，在这些国家的人民之间才会出现真诚的国际合作。”
    恩格斯是中国人民的极其真挚的朋友。他热烈地关注着中国的变革，支持中国人民的斗争。恩格斯和马克思都曾在《纽约每日论坛报》上发表过有关中国问题的时评。在《波斯和中国》（1857年）一文中，恩格斯指出了中国人民的战争的正义性质，痛斥了英帝国主义的海盗行为和欺骗宣传。他说：“我们最好不要像豪侠的英国报纸那样去宣传什么中国人的可怕暴行，而要承认这是争取自己生存的战争，这是谋求保存中华民族的人民战争。”中国人民的民族解放斗争表明“世界上最古老的帝国在作垂死挣扎，同时也是整个亚洲新纪元的曙光”。
    恩格斯自从他成为一个科学的共产主义者起，一直到他逝世，总是充满无产阶级的革命的战斗意志。同马克思一样，他总是把坚定的革命精神同严格的科学精神结合在一起。
    无产阶级政党在决定自己的革命战略和策略的时候，都必须以辩证唯物主义的世界观为前提，客观地考虑社会发展的阶段和各个阶级的相互关系等各种条件。恩格斯是无产阶级的一个伟大战略家。他在一切斗争中总是站在坚定的原则立场上，同时，表现了极大的灵活性。恩格斯不但敢于斗争，而且善于斗争。他精通无产阶级的革命策略。在这个方面，他既和右的机会主义进行不调和的斗争，又尖锐地批评那些“把革命当儿戏”、拒绝必要的合法斗争、醉心于革命空谈的“左”倾机会主义的观点。
    马克思和恩格斯的革命学说的胜利是不可抵抗的。当马克思和恩格斯写作《共产党宣言》的时候，他们只有两个人，接受他们的学说的也只有很少数的人，但是他们充满了对社会主义在全世界的胜利的信心，对资本主义旧世界表现了高度的藐视。《共产党宣言》是以这种豪迈的、洋溢着革命英雄主义气概的句子结束的：“让那些统治阶级在共产主义革命面前颤抖吧。无产者在这个革命中失去的只是自己颈上的锁链，而他们所能获得的却是整个世界。”恩格斯在晚年曾有一次对向他欢呼的群众说：“即使五十年来，我对我参加的运动做出了某些贡献，那我也不希望任何报答。对我来说最好的报答就是你们。对我的报答是整个世界！……我们这些人就是一个使整个世界为之震惊的伟大强国，是一个比其他强国更能决定一切的强国。这就是使我感到骄傲的地方！”现在，世界上的共产党员已经有几千万，世界上的社会主义国家已经占世界四分之一土地，三分之一人口，社会主义阵营力量超过了帝国主义阵营力量，民族解放力量超过了殖民主义力量，人民力量超过了反动力量，和平力量超过了战争力量：一句话，东风压倒了西风。如果马克思和恩格斯能活到今天看到这一切，他们该会多么高兴啊！努力学习马克思和恩格斯的学说，反对形形色色的机会主义，加紧争取世界和平、民族解放、人民民主和社会主义的斗争，这就是我们给革命导师的最好报答。
