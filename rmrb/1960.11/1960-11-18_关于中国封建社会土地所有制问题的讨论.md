Discussion on Land Ownership in Chinese Feudal Society
    Du Wenkai, Ma Ruheng
    In recent years, the question of land ownership in Chinese feudal society has aroused research and discussion in Chinese historical circles. Feudal land ownership is the foundation of the feudal system. Therefore, research and discussion on it will help us to more deeply understand the feudal relations of production in our country.
    As of now, not many articles have been published, but the issues involved are quite extensive, and differences of opinion are obvious. According to published articles, the central issue of contention is: In Chinese feudal society, was land nationalization the dominant system, or was it private large land ownership, that is, landlord land ownership?
    Some comrades believe that since the Qin and Han dynasties, land nationalization has run through the entire feudal history. Throughout the country, "royal landlords" were the highest and main landowners, and the so-called land owned by the state was a royal monopoly. Royal landlords had the power to grant land to people, and peasants only had the right to use the land—"allotment land." The legal concept of private land ownership was relatively lacking. The emergence of this "royal land ownership" is inseparable from water conservancy projects and irrigation undertakings. Due to this "economic public duty," a "political right of dominion" over the land was bound to arise. In addition, the organization of rural communes was the material condition for land nationalization in feudal society, and the supreme owner, the monarch, was the great patriarch of the whole country, the head of the clan. This "royal land ownership" had different specific forms in various dynasties, such as military reclamation, land occupation, equal-field system, official land, imperial land, official estates, and imperial estates. Moreover, they believe that land nationalization was the economic foundation of the central autocracy since the Qin and Han dynasties, and at the same time, the true root of the power struggles in the past dynasties, and the root of the Chinese monarchs' direct use of religion without the separation of royal and religious power, can also be explained from this economic foundation.
    In addition to "royal land ownership," other possession rights existed, first of all, the so-called "possession rights" of powerful landlords, and secondly, the "right to use" the land by farmers as their own land, and even a certain right to buy and sell land. They believe that not only did powerful landlords not have private land ownership, but they were illegal possessors from the beginning, because they were in contradiction with the land ownership of the royal landlords, and when they threatened the royal regime, their property could be confiscated. On the other hand, the emperors adopted certain preferential measures for them as a link between imperial power and powerful families.
    Comrades who advocate "land nationalization" also have differences on individual issues. For example, some comrades disagree with calling "land nationalization" "royal land ownership." The reason is that the "royal family" as a group can include the "monarch," but cannot be equated with the "state," because the monarch also has the nature of a private owner, and state-owned land is not the emperor's personal property.
    Contrary to the claim of land nationalization, more comrades believe that the main form of land ownership in Chinese feudal society was landlord ownership. They point out that private land ownership has existed in our feudal society since the Warring States period. During the Shang Yang Reform, the well-field system was abolished and the boundaries between fields were opened up, and it was clearly stipulated that land "could be bought and sold by the people." The stipulation of free land trade is a sign of the establishment of private land ownership. The free trade of land was legally affirmed, and this was the inevitable result of the entire socio-economic development. "The rich have fields stretching for miles, while the poor do not have enough land to stand on"; farmers "either cultivate the fields of wealthy people and pay taxes of fifteen percent." The fact that landlords owned large amounts of land and levied rent from peasants is strong evidence of the existence of landlord land ownership. Moreover, the vast majority of the peasants' surplus products were seized by the landlord class as private rent, while the taxes occupied by the feudal state accounted for only a small part of the total surplus products of the peasants. Therefore, not only should the existence of landlord land ownership be affirmed, but it should also be affirmed that this kind of ownership occupied a dominant position in our feudal society, because the landlord class was the most important exploiter of the peasants' surplus products.
    Comrades who advocate the dominant position of landlord land ownership do not deny the existence of state-owned land in Chinese feudal society, but they believe that state-owned land of any form is only a supplementary form subordinate to landlord land ownership. Because from a historical point of view, the growth of state-owned land was only possible when peasant uprisings dealt a blow to the landlord class and landlord land ownership. At the same time, any form of state-owned land was ultimately bound to be encroached upon by the land annexation of the landlord class. Records of "rich and powerful families occupying official land" in past dynasties are a reflection of this situation.
    In the discussion, in addition to the above two major differences of opinion, some comrades also believe that land nationalization and private land ownership existed successively in different stages of development in our feudal society. They regard feudal land nationalization as a historical form, with its own process of emergence, development, and demise, rather than running through the entire feudal history. They believe that after the disintegration of feudal land nationalization, landlord land ownership developed and occupied a dominant position. Due to different views on the periodization of ancient history, there are also differences in their division of the period of feudal landlord land ownership.
    Comrades who advocate private land ownership focus on refuting the claim of land nationalization in our feudal society on the following specific issues.
    Regarding the nature of land trade in our feudal society. The free trade of land is an important symbol of the existence of private land ownership. From the history of our feudal society, there has been a large amount of land trade, which is a recognized fact. In this regard, comrades who advocate land nationalization believe that what existed in our feudal society was "land trade restricted by law," which is not enough to prove the existence of private land ownership. However, comrades who advocate private land ownership believe that, in fact, the legal guarantee that land could be traded was formally established from the Shang Yang Reform. Later, land transactions in various dynasties all had "deeds," "documents," etc., all of which were manifestations of the law's recognition of private land ownership. Precisely because "society gives legal provisions to actual possession, actual possession has the nature of legal possession, and has the nature of private property" (Marx: "Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right"). Comrades who advocate land nationalization also believe that land ownership in our feudal society cannot enter the commodity circulation process like in modern times, and therefore cannot form "free private land ownership." However, comrades who advocate private land ownership believe that this is obviously using the concept of capitalist "free private land ownership" to demand feudal land ownership, which in reality denies that feudal land ownership should have its own characteristics. Even if the feudal state has certain restrictions on land trade, it can only show that the degree of "freedom" is not enough compared to capitalism, but it cannot deny the existence of private land ownership.
    Regarding the relationship between rent and taxation. Comrades who advocate land nationalization believe that the unity of rent and taxation is a characteristic of feudal societies in Asian countries, and in this case, the landlord is also the state of the sovereign, so the land ownership of Chinese feudal society is state-owned. However, comrades who advocate private land ownership believe that in some Asian countries where land nationalization exists, rent and taxation are indeed unified; while in our feudal society, the separation of rent and taxation is the dominant phenomenon. In the Han Dynasty, there were records of "officials collecting one percent of the tax, and the people paying more than half of the rent. The benefits of the official family are better than the three dynasties, and the tyranny of the powerful is worse than the Qin Dynasty." Down to the Tang and Song Dynasties, "official land has rent, and private land has tax." The difference between "official tax" and "private rent" is very clear. Here, what the landlord class paid to the state was tax, not rent, although its essence was the redistribution of rent; what the peasants who cultivated the landlord's land paid to the landlord was rent, which was the exploitation of the peasants' surplus labor. Comrades who advocate private land ownership also said: In order to describe the land ownership of Chinese feudal society as state-owned, comrades who advocate state-owned land describe the tax paid by landlords to the feudal state as "rent" rather than "tax," which obliterates the difference between "official tax" and "private rent," thus drawing the erroneous conclusion that besides the feudal state, there is no longer any opposition between the exploiting and exploited classes in the vast social population.
    Regarding the relationship between political power and economic power. Comrades who advocate land nationalization believe that if there is a supreme power controlling the rights of private possession, use, control, including buying and selling, then this kind of property is not private property, but closer to state-owned property than private property. This supreme power of dominion is ownership itself, the highest stage of private property, that is, the state's supreme ownership. However, comrades who advocate private land ownership believe that this view lacks evidence. Because the so-called supreme political power of the state is ultimately determined by the economic base. On the surface, it seems that private ownership is dominated by state power, but in fact, state power is dominated by private ownership. In Chinese history, the reason why the feudal state gave private ownership a certain dominance was precisely to maintain the rule of the landlord class over the peasants and to maintain the land ownership of the landlords. Politics is the concentrated expression of economics. Therefore, it is not in line with the principles of Marxism-Leninism to juxtapose political power and ownership relations. Of course, in places based on state ownership, all land is concentrated as state-owned, and royal power is embodied as the state's supreme ownership of land. As for the opposite case, in places based on private ownership, although the state can be embodied as the supreme political power, it cannot be embodied as the state's supreme ownership of land.
    Regarding the relationship between feudal land ownership and class struggle. Comrades who advocate private land ownership believe that large-scale peasant uprisings and peasant wars in Chinese history broke out under the circumstances that the landlord class controlled a large amount of land and carried out cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of peasants who were too poor to have a place to stand. Therefore, it is impossible to correctly understand the peasant uprisings in Chinese history without breaking away from landlord land ownership. Only "landlord land ownership" can reveal the material basis for landlords to exploit peasants, and can be used as an important basis for dividing the classes of our feudal society. The claim of land nationalization cannot only fail to explain the antagonism between the landlord class and the peasant class, but also lead to the concealment of the essence of class antagonism and the blurring of class boundaries. Comrades who advocate private land ownership also demonstrate from the practice of the old democratic revolution and the new democratic revolution in modern China that the existence of private land ownership, and that it is the main form of land ownership in Chinese feudal society, therefore anti-feudalism is one of the main tasks of the democratic revolution.

    关于中国封建社会土地所有制问题的讨论
    杜文凯　马汝珩
    近几年来，关于中国封建社会土地所有制问题，在我国史学界中引起了研究和讨论。封建土地所有制是封建制度的基础，因此，对它的研究和讨论将有助于我们更深刻地对我国封建生产关系的理解。
    截至目前，发表的文章还不很多，但是涉及的问题相当广泛，意见的分歧也是明显的。根据已发表的文章，争论的中心问题是：在中国封建社会占支配地位的是土地国有制，还是私人大土地所有制，即地主土地所有制？
    一部分同志认为秦汉以来土地国有制贯串着全部封建史。在全国范围之内“皇族地主”是最高的主要的土地所有者，所谓土地为国家所有乃是皇族垄断。皇族地主有赐给人土地的权力，农民对于土地——“份地”只有使用权。土地私有权的法律观念是比较缺乏的。这种“皇族土地所有制”的产生，是和水利工程、灌溉事业分不开的。由于这种“经济的公共职务”，必然产生对土地的“政治支配权”。此外，农村公社的组织是封建社会的土地国有制的物质条件，最高所有者君主正是全国宗主的大宗主，大家长。这种“皇族土地所有制”在历代有屯田、占田、均田、官田、皇田、官庄和皇庄等不同的具体形式。并且，他们认为土地国有制是秦汉以来的中央专制的经济基础，同时历代党争的真实根源、中国历代君主之直接利用宗教而无皇权教权的分立的根源，也可以从这种经济基础上说明。
    除了“皇族土地所有权”以外，还有其他占有权的存在，首先是所谓豪强地主的“占有权”，其次是农民当作自己土地的“使用权”，甚至有一定的土地买卖权。他们认为豪强地主不仅没有土地私有权，而且从最初就是不合法的占有者，因为他们是和皇族地主的土地所有制相矛盾的，当他们威胁到皇族政权的时候，他们的财产就可能被没官。另一方面，皇帝对他们又采取一定的优遇办法，作为皇权与豪权的联系。
    主张“土地国有制”的同志在个别问题上也还存在着分歧。例如，有的同志不同意把
  “土地国有制”称之为“皇族土地所有制”。其理由是，“皇族”这个集团可以包括“君王”在内，但不能等于“国家”，因为君王也具有私有主的性质，而国有土地还不是皇帝个人的私产。
    和土地国有制的主张相反，更多的同志认为中国封建社会土地所有制的主要形式是地主所有制。他们指出，我国封建社会从战国以来就存在着土地私有制。商鞅变法时废井田开阡陌，明确规定土地“民得买卖”。土地自由买卖的规定，是土地私有制确立的标志。土地自由买卖在法律上得到了肯定，这是整个社会经济发展必然导致的结果。“富者田连阡陌，贫者无立锥之地”；农民“或耕豪民之田，见税十五”。地主拥有大量土地，对农民征取地租的事实，正是地主土地所有制存在的有力证明。并且，农民的剩余生产物是绝大部分当私租被地主阶级占有的，而封建国家所占有的赋税在农民全部剩余生产物中只占较少的部分。因此，不仅应当肯定地主土地所有权的存在，而且尤其应当肯定这种所有权在我国封建社会的支配地位，因为地主阶级是农民剩余生产物的最主要剥削者。
    主张地主土地所有制占支配地位的同志也不否认我国封建社会中国有土地的存在，但是他们认为不论那种形式的国有土地只是从属于地主土地所有制的一种补充形式。因为从历史上来看，国有土地的增长只有当农民起义对地主阶级及地主土地所有制有所打击的时候才有可能，同时，任何形式的国有土地最终也不免被地主阶级的土地兼并所蚕食。历代有关“富家豪室，多占取公田”的记载，正是这种情况的反映。
    在讨论中，除以上两种主要的不同意见以外，也还有部分同志认为在我国封建社会不同的发展阶段先后存在着土地国有制和土地私有制。他们把封建土地国有制看作是一个历史形态，有它的发生、发展和消亡的过程，而不是贯串着全部封建史。他们认为，在封建土地国有制解体之后，地主土地所有制日益发展，处于主导地位。由于对古代史分期的见解不同，他们对封建地主土地所有制时期的划分，也就存在着分歧。
    主张土地私有制的同志集中地在以下几个具体问题上反对我国封建社会土地国有制的主张。
    关于我国封建社会土地买卖的性质问题。土地的自由买卖是土地私有权存在的重要标志。从我国封建社会的历史来看，存在着大量的土地买卖，这是一个公认的事实。对此，主张土地国有制的同志认为，我国封建社会存在的是“被法律所限制的土地买卖”，这是不足以证明土地私有制的存在的。但是，主张土地私有制的同志认为，事实上从商鞅变法开始就正式确立了土地可以买卖的法律保障。以后历代土地买卖都有“文券”、“文牒”等等，这些都是法律承认土地私有制的表现。正因为“社会赋予实际占有以法律的规定，实际占有才具有合法占有的性质，才具有私有财产的性质”（马克思：《黑格尔法哲学批判》）。主张土地国有制的同志又认为，我国封建社会的土地所有权不能进入如近代的商品流通过程，因而不能形成“自由的土地私有权”。但是，主张土地私有制的同志认为，这显然是以资本主义的“自由的土地私有权”的概念来要求封建的土地所有权，实际上便是否定了封建土地所有权应该具有自己的特点。即使封建国家对土地买卖有某些限制，也只能说明比之资本主义“自由”的程度还不够，但不能否认土地私有制的存在。
    关于地租和课税的关系问题。主张土地国有制的同志认为，地租与课税的合一是亚洲各国封建社会的特点，而在这种情况下，地主同时又是主权者的国家，因此，中国封建社会的土地所有制是国有制。但是，主张土地私有制的同志认为，在亚洲某些存在土地国有制的国家，地租与课税确是合一的；而在我国封建社会，地租与课税的分离却是主导的现象。在汉代便有“官收百一之税，民输太半之赋。官家之惠优于三代，豪强之暴酷于亡秦”的记载，下至唐宋“官田有租，民田有税”，“官税”与“私租”的区别是很明确的。在这里，地主阶级向国家缴纳的是课税，而不是地租，虽然其本质上是地租的再分配；耕种地主土地的农民向地主缴纳的是地租，是对于农民剩余劳动的榨取。主张土地私有制的同志还说：为了要把中国封建社会的土地所有制说成国有制，主张土地国有的同志便把地主交纳给封建国家的课税说成是“地租”而不是“课税”，这就抹煞了“官税”与“私租”的区别，从而就会得出除了封建国家以外，在广大的社会人群当中，再没有什么剥削阶级和被剥削阶级的对立的错误结论。
    关于政治权力和经济权力的关系问题。主张土地国有制的同志认为，如果在私人占有、使用、支配、包括买卖等权力之上，还有一个最高权力支配的话，这种财产就不算私有财产，与其说近于私有，不如说近于国有。这种最高支配权力就是所有权本身，是最高阶段的私有财产，即国家最高所有权。但是，主张土地私有制的同志认为，这种见解是缺乏论据的。因为所谓国家最高政治权力，最终决定于经济基础。从表面上看，好像私有制受国家权力的支配，其实国家权力却受私有制的支配。在中国历史上，封建国家之所以给私有制以某种支配，也正是为了维护地主阶级对农民的统治，维护地主的土地所有制。政治是经济的集中表现，因此，把政治权力和所有制关系对立起来，是不符合马克思列宁主义原理的。当然，在以国家所有制为基础的地方，全部土地都集中为国家所有，王权是体现为国家对土地的最高所有权。至于在相反的情况下，在以私有制为基础的地方，国家虽然可以体现为最高政治权力，但是不能体现为国家对土地的最高所有权。
    关于封建土地所有制和阶级斗争的关系问题。主张土地私有制的同志认为，我国历史上大规模的农民起义和农民战争，是在地主阶级掌握大量土地，对贫无立锥之地的农民进行残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫的情况下爆发的。因此，脱离开地主土地所有制是无法正确地理解我国历史上的农民起义的。只有“地主土地所有制”，才能揭露地主剥削农民的物质基础，才能作为划分我国封建社会各阶级的重要依据。主张土地国有制不仅无法说明地主阶级与农民阶级的对抗，并将导致阶级对立实质的被掩盖和阶级界限的被模糊。主张土地私有制的同志还从中国近代旧民主主义革命和新民主主义革命的实践，论证了土地私有制的存在，并且是中国封建社会土地所有制的主要形式，因此反封建是民主主义革命的主要任务之一。
