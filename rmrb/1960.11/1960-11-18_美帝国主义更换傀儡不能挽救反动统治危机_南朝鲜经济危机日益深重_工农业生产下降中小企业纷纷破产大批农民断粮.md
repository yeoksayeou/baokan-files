Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 17th: A dispatch from our correspondent reports that since the U.S. imperialist's new puppet, Chang Myon, came to power, the economic crisis in South Korea has worsened, and the people's lives have become more difficult.

The "Industry and Economy News" published in Seoul recently carried a cartoon titled "Nothing More Than a String of Beautiful Words," depicting Chang Myon holding a painting of a house with the words "Economy First Doctrine" written on it, using this painting to comfort a poverty-stricken "Korean Economy" who is disheveled, barefoot, covered in straw mats, and suffering from illness. This cartoon illustrates that people, from the actual actions of Chang Myon in the months since he came to power, have seen through Chang Myon's so-called "Economy First Doctrine," which he shouts about every day, as nothing more than a pie in the sky.

After Chang Myon came to power, he clamored about "developing electricity resources" in the industrial sector, but according to the "Industry and Economy News," South Korea's electricity difficulties will reach their most serious point this winter. The newspaper said that South Korea needs a minimum of 420,000 kilowatts of electricity this winter, but the increasingly declining electricity industry can only supply 195,000 kilowatts. The newspaper said: "Due to electricity difficulties and lack of funds, industrial production in the second half of this year will inevitably decline sharply." As for residential lighting, which was originally only supplied for a few hours a day, it will now have to be supplied on a rotating basis. South Korean newspapers sarcastically said that South Korea will become a "dark world" this winter.

The recent further bankruptcy of small and medium-sized enterprises in South Korea also proves that Chang Myon's so-called "substantial development of small and medium-sized enterprises" is completely empty talk. "Industry and Economy News" said that due to insufficient supply of electricity and oil and lack of funds, and the "government" taking a bystander attitude, all small and medium-sized enterprises in Gyeonggi Province are facing bankruptcy. There are 697 small and medium-sized mines of various types in this province, of which 555 have been shut down.

In order to deceive the vast number of farmers who account for 70% of the South Korean population, Chang Myon claimed after taking office that he "will make the greatest efforts to revitalize rural and fishing villages." But in fact, the agricultural expenditure in the next year's fiscal budget recently proposed by the Chang Myon cabinet is 2.5 billion won less than the budget formulated by the already collapsed Syngman Rhee regime this year. South Korean agriculture suffered a severe crop failure this year. According to published materials, it is estimated that this year's autumn grain output will be reduced by 1.25 million "seok" (each "seok" is 150 kilograms) compared with previous years. According to South Korean newspapers, now that the autumn harvest has just passed, more than 35,000 farmers in Uiseong County, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea's grain-producing area, have run out of food. North and South Gyeongsang Provinces and North and South Jeolla Provinces, known as South Korea's "granary," currently have a large number of farmers running out of food. Many farmers sell their sons and daughters to survive, with a young woman selling for 20,000 won (which can buy about 60 kilograms of rice). "Industry and Economy News" said that this is "the most serious phenomenon in fifteen years."

Due to economic bankruptcy, people's lives have become more impoverished. "Industry and Economy News" said: "Now the people are living a more impoverished life than during the old regime (referring to the Syngman Rhee regime)."

### 美帝国主义更换傀儡不能挽救反动统治危机  南朝鲜经济危机日益深重  工农业生产下降中小企业纷纷破产大批农民断粮

    美帝国主义更换傀儡不能挽救反动统治危机
    南朝鲜经济危机日益深重
    工农业生产下降中小企业纷纷破产大批农民断粮
    新华社平壤17日电　本社记者报道，美帝国主义的新傀儡张勉上台以后，南朝鲜的经济危机更加严重，人民生活更加困苦。
    汉城出版的“产业经济新闻”最近刊载了一幅漫画，标题是“只不过是美丽词句的罗列”，上面画着张勉拿着一幅画，画上有一所房子，写着“经济第一主义”，他用这幅画来安慰一个蓬头赤足、身披草席、贫病交加的“韩国经济”。这幅画说明，人们从张勉上台以来几个月的实际行动中，已经看透了张勉天天叫嚷的所谓“经济第一主义”，只不过是画饼充饥的谎言。
    张勉上台后，在工业方面叫嚷什么“开发电力资源”，但据“产业经济新闻”报道，今冬南朝鲜的电力困难将达到最严重的地步。这家报纸说，南朝鲜今冬最低限度需要四十二万瓩电力，但是，日益衰败的电力工业今冬却只能供应十九万五千瓩电。这家报纸说：“由于电力困难和资金缺乏，今年下半年的工业生产将不可避免地急剧下降。”至于居民的照明用电，原来每天就只供应几小时，现在就只好改为轮流供应了。南朝鲜报纸讽刺说，今冬南朝鲜将成为“黑暗世界”。
    最近南朝鲜中小企业进一步破产的事实也证明了张勉的所谓“切实发展中小企业”完全是空谈。“产业经济新闻”说，由于电力、石油的供应不足和资金缺乏，而“政府”又采取旁观态度，京畿道内的全部中小企业正面临破产。这个道有各种中小矿山六百九十七个，其中已有五百五十五个陷于停工状态。
    张勉为了欺骗占南朝鲜人口70％的广大农民，在上台后曾声称，“将以最大的努力复兴农村、渔村”。但事实上，在张勉内阁最近提出的明年财政预算中的农业开支，比已经垮台的李承晚政权制订的今年的预算还减少了二十五亿圜。今年南朝鲜农业遭到了严重的歉收。据发表的材料，预计今年的秋季粮食产量将比往年减产一百二十五万石（每石一百五十公斤）。据南朝鲜报纸报道，现在秋收刚过，南朝鲜的产粮区庆尚北道义城郡就已经有三万五千多名农民断了粮。号称南朝鲜“谷仓”的庆尚南北道和全罗南北道目前有大批断粮农民。许多农民为了活命卖儿卖女，一个大姑娘卖二万圜（能买约六十公斤米）。“产业经济新闻”说，这是“十五年来最严重的现象”。
    由于经济破产，人民生活也更加贫困。“产业经济新闻”说：“现在国民过着比旧政权（指李承晚政权）时期更加贫困的生活”。
