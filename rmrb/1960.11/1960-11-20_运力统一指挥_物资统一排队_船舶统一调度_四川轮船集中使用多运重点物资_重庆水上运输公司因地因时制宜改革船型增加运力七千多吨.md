    Unified Command of Transport Capacity, Unified Queuing of Materials, Unified Scheduling of Ships
    Sichuan Steamships Concentrated for Transporting Key Materials
    Chongqing Water Transport Company Increased Transport Capacity by More Than 7,000 Tons Through Adapting Ship Types to Local Conditions and Time
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Sichuan Daily: Sichuan Province's steamship transport departments have further strengthened organizational leadership, implementing unified scheduling of steamships that were previously used in a decentralized manner. In October, the province's steamship transport of steel materials increased by more than 32% compared to September.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, Sichuan Province's steamship transport has greatly developed. However, because these ships were used in a decentralized manner by various localities, operating on one or two dozen routes on the Yangtze, Jialing, Minjiang, and Qujiang rivers, the distribution was wide, and the arrangement was not entirely appropriate, making it impossible to guarantee the timely transportation of key materials. The utilization rate of the ships was also not high enough, and many potentials were not fully realized. In order to improve the above situation, rationally use transport capacity, fully leverage the role of steamship transport, and better guarantee the transportation of key materials, the Provincial Transportation Command and the Provincial Department of Transportation organized these dispersed steamships in early October, implementing unified planning of transport capacity, unified queuing of materials, and unified scheduling of ships (the operation, economic accounting, mechanical maintenance, fuel, and material supply of the ships are still the responsibility of the original units). Starting from guaranteeing key materials, starting from the overall situation, breaking down the boundaries between regions and enterprises, the majority of steamship transport capacity was concentrated on the Yibin-Chongqing section of the Yangtze River and the Hechuan-Chongqing section of the Jialing River to undertake the transportation of key materials such as pig iron, coke, refractory materials, and grain. In order to strengthen the leadership of this work, a steamship scheduling office was established within the Provincial Transportation Command to specifically responsible for the organization, balancing, and arrangement of transport capacity, material queuing, and ship scheduling.
    As of now, a total of forty-nine steamships and two hundred thirty-five barges have been included in the unified scheduling. According to statistics from ships concentrated on the Jialing River, the horsepower utilization rate of steamships has increased by 30%, and the turnover rate of barges has increased by 40%. Due to the increase in transport capacity on key routes, the backlog of materials in ports has also greatly improved. At the beginning of October, the Hechuan port often had more than two to three thousand tons of materials waiting to be loaded and unloaded. After a concentrated effort over a short period of time, the backlog at the port was basically eliminated. Due to the increase in towed barges, the Provincial Steamship Company's cargo transportation volume in October increased by 11.77% compared to the previous month, with pig iron transport increasing by 26.44% and coke increasing by 124.6%. Due to participating in unified scheduling, the steamships in the Jiangjin Special District overcame the past phenomenon of steamship repairs while barges were idle, and barge repairs while steamships were idle, transporting more than two thousand tons of materials in the middle and late ten days of the month.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Chongqing Water Transport Company has vigorously reformed ship types. From January to the end of October this year, it has reformed six hundred ninety-one barges, with a net increase in transport capacity of more than seven thousand five hundred tons.
    The core of Chongqing Water Transport Company's technical revolution movement is the reform of ship types. According to the characteristics of Chongqing's wharves, the high frequency of ship towing, and large changes in water levels, the company has always adhered to the principle of "adapting to local conditions and adapting to the times." For example, during the flood season, the characteristics of the Jialing River are steep rises and falls, with large waves and ships easily taking on water. The Party committee, together with the workers, studied and vigorously carried out "hardening and squaring," increasing the height of the ships to both block floodwaters and increase the load capacity by 30%. When the dry season was approaching, the Party committee turned the focus of the technical revolution to breaking through the key to ships passing through shallow water, vigorously promoting "pontoonization." Due to the close integration of the technical revolution and the company's current production, production has rapidly increased. In the third quarter, the company's transport capacity surged by five thousand tons, more than doubling compared to the first quarter.

    运力统一指挥　物资统一排队　船舶统一调度
    四川轮船集中使用多运重点物资
    重庆水上运输公司因地因时制宜改革船型增加运力七千多吨
    本报讯　据四川日报消息：四川省轮船运输部门进一步加强组织领导工作，把原来分散使用的轮船实行统一调度，10月份全省轮船运输钢铁物资数量比9月提高32％以上。
    大跃进以来，四川省轮船运输有很大发展。但由于这批船只是各地分散使用的，行驶在长江、嘉陵江、岷江、渠江等几条河流的一二十条航线上，分布面广，摆布不完全适当，不能用来保证重点物资的及时运输；船只利用率也不够高，有许多潜力没有充分发挥出来。为了改善上述状况，合理使用运力，充分发挥轮船运输的作用，更好地保证重点物资的运输，省运输指挥部和省交通厅于10月上旬将这批分散的轮船组织起来，实行运力统一计划，物资统一排队，船舶统一调度（船只的经营，经济核算，机务检修，燃料、材料供应等，仍由原单位负责），从保证重点物资出发，从全局出发，打破地区和企业的界限，把大部分轮船运力集中在长江宜（宾）渝
  （重庆）段和嘉陵江合（川）渝段这两条航线上，担负生铁、煤焦、耐火材料和粮食等重点物资的运输。为了加强这一工作的领导，在省运输指挥部内成立了轮船调度办公室，具体负责运力的组织平衡安排、物资排队和船舶调度等工作。
    到目前为止，已纳入统一调度的轮船共四十九艘，驳船二百三十五只。据集中在嘉陵江船只的统计，轮船马力利用率提高了30％，驳船周转率提高了40％。由于重点航线运力增加，港口物资积压现象也大有好转。合川港10月初待装待卸物资经常在二、三千吨以上，经过集中力量短期突击，基本上消除了港口的积压。省轮船公司由于增加了被拖驳船，10月份完成货物运输量比上月增加11.77％，其中生铁运量增长26.44％，煤焦增长124.6％。江津专区轮船由于参加了统一调度，克服了过去轮船修理，驳船停起；驳船修理，轮船闲起的现象，中下旬即多运物资二千余吨。
    本报讯　重庆市水上运输公司大力改革船型，从今年1至10月底，已改革驳船六百九十一艘，净增运力七千五百多吨。
    重庆市水上运输公司技术革命运动的中心是改革船型。根据重庆码头的特点，船只拖带多、水位变化大的情况，公司始终坚持了“因地制宜、因时制宜”的原则。如在洪水时期，嘉陵江的特点是陡涨陡跌，水野浪大，船只易进水，党委便和工人们研究，大搞“硬方化”，增加船只高度，既拦野水，又可增加载量30％。当枯水位即将到来的时候，党委又将技术革命的矛头引向突破船只过浅水的关键，大搞“浮筒化”。由于技术革命和公司当前生产的紧密结合，促进了生产迅速上升，三季度全公司猛增运力五千吨，比一季度提高了一倍多。
