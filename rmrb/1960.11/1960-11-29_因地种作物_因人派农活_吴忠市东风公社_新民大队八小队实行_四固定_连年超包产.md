Planting Crops According to the Land, Assigning Farm Work According to the Person
    The Eighth Small Team of the Xinmin Brigade of the Dongfeng Commune in Wuzhong City Implements "Four Fixes," Surpassing Production Quotas for Consecutive Years
    (Our dispatch) The Eighth Small Team of the Xinmin Brigade of the Dongfeng Commune in Wuzhong City, Ningxia, under the leadership of the commune and brigade, has fully utilized the conditions of "four fixes" (land, labor, draught animals, and farm tools) for the past two years and comprehensively implemented the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, surpassing grain production quotas year after year.
    With fixed land, this small team can plan and utilize the land rationally. Their specific approach is to conduct surveys and rankings of each plot of the 469 mu of land, identify soil types, fertility, and classify them into different grades. Then, they convene a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" with experienced old farmers and, based on the production plans arranged by the brigade, make specific arrangements to ensure that various crops are planted on the most suitable land. For example, this small team plants wheat, vegetables, and hemp in high-lying, fertile soil; they plant coarse grains and beans in the poorer "second-exposed fields"; and in low-lying lake fields, they plant wheat in the more fertile soil and rice in the alkaline soil. Because various crops are planted in the most suitable land, the stable growth of crop yields is ensured. The fixed use of land by the small team enhances the responsibility of the commune members for land management. This year, the wheat work group planted 153 mu of wheat, and the commune members knew everything about the soil quality of each plot, the growth of each mu of wheat, the best fertilizer to apply, and the amount to use. At the same time, the commune members paid special attention to basic farmland construction and soil improvement. This small team originally had more than 90 mu of saline-alkali land. Due to poor drainage, seedlings could not be established, and yields were very low. Last year, the commune members actively proposed eliminating the team's third-class land, and they dug two drainage ditches to drain and leach alkali, lowering the groundwater level. This year, this low-yield field also achieved a bumper harvest.
    With fixed labor, the role of each laborer can be brought into play more rationally. This small team, according to production needs, formed three production work groups and one fertilizer accumulation group, established a production responsibility system, and under the demand of achieving the "Three Guarantees" targets, the work groups were specifically responsible for implementing yield-increasing technical measures. In addition to the fertilizer accumulation group which is fixed year-round to specialize in fertilizer accumulation, the other three groups have both a division of labor and mutual cooperation. During different growth periods of different crops, the production team leader makes unified arrangements according to the needs of farm work, ensuring that farm work in each period is carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and that all yield-increasing measures are implemented.
    After fixing draught animals, the commune members established a set of scientific management systems. Because the livestock are managed and used for specific purposes, well-fed, and carefully cared for by the commune members, all 15 large livestock in the team are strong and healthy, ensuring the needs of the team for cultivation and transportation.
    After fixing farm tools, each farm tool also has a designated person in charge of safekeeping and use, and procedures for borrowing and using them have been established. The custodian, Jin Zhanhai, is a carpenter by training. The farm tools under his care are always neat and tidy, not at all disorganized, and very convenient for the commune members to use. When he sees that farm tools are broken, he repairs them himself, saving a lot of replacement and repair costs.
    Recently, the Party branch of this small team summarized the following benefits of "four fixes":
    First, "four fixes" is an important guarantee for realizing the "Three Guarantees" contract. Because land, labor, draught animals, and farm tools are fixed for use by the small team, the small team can determine the planting area, planned output, and yield-increasing measures according to the specific conditions of the small team, economize on the use of labor, animal power, and tools, save expenses, and reduce costs. At the same time, after "four fixes," because measures are implemented in the fields, responsibility is assigned to individuals, and the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture is comprehensively and meticulously implemented in accordance with local conditions, increased grain production is guaranteed.
    Second, after "four fixes," it is more convenient to carry out the high-efficiency movement and implement the distribution system of work evaluation and recording points, and more pay for more work. After the small team implements yields according to crop area, they matched labor, animal power, and farm tools, and generally no longer change them. Labor quotas are set for each farm work, and work point standards are determined. After the commune members complete the quota, after acceptance, if the quality meets the standard, different work points are assessed and recorded according to the quantity and quality completed by each person. For example, deep plowing of seven points of land is specified as six work points. After the commune members complete it ahead of schedule, they can earn more work points if they do more, or rest earlier. In this way, not only is work efficiency improved, but the labor time is also shortened.
    Third, after "four fixes," the commune members care about the collective. For example, this year, the seedlings in a field of more than 30 mu grew yellow and thin. The commune members consciously analyzed the reasons and believed that the main reason was that not enough fertilizer had been applied and that more topdressing was needed. While other land was only topdressed two to three times, this land was topdressed four times, catching up with the first-class fields and achieving a bumper harvest.

    因地种作物　因人派农活
    吴忠市东风公社  新民大队八小队实行“四固定”连年超包产
    本报讯　宁夏吴忠市东风公社新民大队第八小队，两年来在公社、大队的领导下，充分运用土地、劳力、耕畜、农具“四固定”的条件，全面执行农业“八字宪法”，两年来，粮食年年超包产。
    土地固定了，这个小队就有计划合理利用土地。他们的具体做法是：把四百六十九亩土地，逐块进行勘察排队，查清土壤种类、土质的肥薄、分类分等，然后召集有经验的老农开
  “诸葛亮会”，根据大队布置的各项生产计划，具体安排，使各种作物种在最适宜生长的土地上。例如这个小队把高田、土质肥沃的田种植小麦、蔬菜和大麻；把土质较差的“二曝田”种杂粮和豆类；在低洼湖田中又把土质较肥的田种植小麦，带有碱性的地种植水稻。由于各种作物种在最适宜生长的地里，保证了作物产量的稳定增长。土地固定在小队使用，增强了社员对土地加工管理的责任心。今年，小麦作业组种植了一百五十三亩小麦，社员们对每块地的土质、每一亩小麦的生长情况、上什么肥最好、数量多少，都了如指掌。同时，社员们特别注意农田基本建设，改良土壤。这个小队原来有九十多亩盐碱地，因排水不利，捉不住苗，产量很低。去年社员积极提出消灭小队的三类田，开挖了两道排水沟，排水洗碱，降低了地下水位，今年这块低产田也获得丰收。
    劳力固定了，可以更合理地发挥每个劳动力的作用。这个小队按照生产需要，组成三个生产作业组和一个积肥专业组，建立了生产责任制，根据实现“三包”指标的要求，由作业组具体负责贯彻增产技术措施。除了积肥专业组常年固定专门积肥外，其他三个组既有一定分工，又有相互合作，在不同作物的不同生长期间，由生产小队长根据农活需要，进行统一调配，保证每一时期的农活有计划有步骤地进行，增产措施全部实现。
    耕畜固定以后，社员们建立了一套科学管理制度。由于牲口专管专用，饲养好，社员爱护，使役得当，全小队十五头大牲畜都膘满力壮，保证了小队耕作和运输的需要。
    农具固定以后，各种农具也都有专人保管、专人使用，并建立了取用手续。保管员金占海是木匠出身，他经手保管的农具经常整整齐齐，一点不乱，社员们使用起来非常方便。他看到农具坏了，就自己动手修理，节省了不少添置和修理费用。
    最近，这个小队党支部总结出“四固定”有以下几条好处：
    第一、“四固定”是实现“三包”合同的重要保证。由于土地、劳力、耕畜、农具固定在小队使用，小队就可以按照小队的具体情况确定播种面积、计划产量和增产措施，节约使用劳力、畜力和工具，节省开支，降低成本。同时，“四固定”后，由于措施落实到田、责任到人，全面地细致地因地制宜地贯彻农业“八字宪法”，保证了粮食增产。
    第二、“四固定”后，更便利开展高工效运动，贯彻评工记分、多劳多得的分配制度。这个小队按作物面积把产量落实以后，把劳力、畜力和农具搭配好，一般不再变动，对每项农活都制定了劳动定额，确定了工分标准。社员完成定额后，经过验收，质量达到标准的就按照各人完成的数量质量评记不同的工分。例如，深翻七分地规定六个工分，社员提前完成以后，多干再多得工分，或者早休息。这样，不但提高了工效，而且缩短了劳动时间。
    第三、“四固定”后，社员人人关心集体。例如今年有一块三十多亩大的田苗长得黄瘦，社员就自觉地分析原因，认为主要是肥料没有上足，需要多追肥。其他土地只追二至三次肥，而这块土地却追了四次，赶上一类田，获得了丰收。
