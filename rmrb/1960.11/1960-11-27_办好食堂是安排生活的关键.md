    Persist in Holding Members' Living Representative Meetings
    The Xiahe Production Team of the Shuiku People's Commune in Miyun County, Beijing, adheres to the member living representative meetings to ensure that the canteen is run better and better.
    The member living representative meeting is established under the leadership of the Party branch through democratic election of representatives, and is generally held once every half month. Before the meeting, the member representatives go deep into the masses to widely solicit members' opinions on life (mainly the canteen), and then submit them to the production team or canteen for resolution through representative discussions. In addition to supervising the canteen's grain arrangement, reviewing grain usage plans, and adjusting grain usage indicators at any time according to the agricultural season and the intensity of agricultural work, the living representative meeting also has the right to inspect the work of the catering management personnel, and discuss and decide on other important issues in life.
    Food Grain Arranged Once Until Next Summer
    The Zhenzhou Brigade of the Baimaqiao People's Commune in Ningxiang County, Hunan, mobilized the masses to verify production and arranged the food grain until the next early rice harvest at one time to the canteen (indicators determined to the household), and allocated the physical objects to the canteen as they were, to be jointly managed by the canteen and the production brigade.
    More than a month after the brigade arranged the grain, each canteen strictly implemented the use of grain according to quota, and no household exceeded the grain usage indicator. The entire team also saved more than 4,000 catties of grain.
    "Ten Months Ahead" Knowledge of Grain and Vegetable Consumption
    The canteens of the Pijiazhuang Production Team of the Hanjiawa People's Commune in Dingxian County, Hebei Province, promoted the "ten months ahead" knowledge of grain and vegetable consumption and the "ten-day food chart", which were widely welcomed by the masses.
    After the implementation of the above methods, there are mainly the following two benefits summarized: (1) The members and canteen management personnel have a clear understanding, so they can earnestly implement the planned use of grain and vegetables; (2) It promotes the democratic management of the canteen.
    Great Efforts to Grasp the "Five Things of the Canteen"
    In order to improve the lives of the masses, Pingliang City, Gansu Province, made great efforts to grasp the "five things of the canteen": changing small pots and small steamers to large pots and large steamers; promoting automatic blast stoves; changing flour processing from animal-powered dry grinding to water-powered power grinding and wind-powered "flywheel grinding"; organizing professional teams to pull coal for the canteen; and establishing vegetable bases.
    At present, 41% of the city's 1,890 canteens have achieved the requirements of the "five things," which effectively improved the operational management level of the canteens. At the same time, the city's canteens have reduced the number of cooks, administrators, and grain processors by about 2,000 people, and 1,200 livestock for processing grain.
    Implementing the "Help Cook" System
    The Gongqinghao Canteen of the Kai Tao People's Commune Shiqiao Management Area in Yuncheng, Shanxi, recently implemented the "help cook" system. This system stipulates that cadres who eat in the canteen should take turns to go to the kitchen to "help cook"; one representative should be selected from every ten members to take turns to "help cook." The canteen also organizes members to use their spare time to hold an "Love the Canteen Day" once every half month, mainly to help the canteen staff engage in family sideline production. Because "helping cook" has become a system, this canteen has streamlined some cooks and put them into agricultural production.
    Planning Grain Usage with Foresight
    Last year, the Baoxian Management Area of the Hulan People's Commune in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, suffered a reduction in production due to flooding. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the members looked ahead and behind, used grain carefully, and saved grain. This year, seven of the nine canteens in the area have a surplus of more than 6,000 catties of grain. Because the life is well arranged, the members overcame the drought this year on the basis of suffering from floods last year, and the total grain output of the area increased by 23.8% compared with last year.
    Storing Sufficient Fuel and Saving Fuel
    The Baxiasi Production Team of the Xindian People's Commune in Lintao County, Gansu Province, centered on the canteen, vigorously grasped fuel reserves on the one hand, and reformed old-style stoves to save fuel on the other hand. Now, the team has reserved ten months' worth of fuel for the canteen. In addition, it has also reserved a large amount of firewood and grass for members' families to keep warm in winter. Since August, the production team has mobilized the masses, combined with the autumn harvest and "small autumn harvest," and adopted the method of not going to the fields empty-handed and carrying a basket after work, cutting firewood and picking up grass more than 300,000 catties. The canteen of the first team has repaired tree branches and reserved more than 100,000 catties of firewood. The team has transformed the original one-stove-one-pot of the seven canteens into one-stove-multiple-pots, which can burn coal, firewood, and cogongrass.

    办好食堂是安排生活的关键
    坚持社员生活代表会
    北京密云县水库公社下河生产队坚持社员生活代表会，保证食堂越办越好。
    社员生活代表会是在党支部领导下，通过民主选举代表建立的，一般情况下每半月开一次会。开会前，由社员代表深入群众，广泛征求社员对生活（主要是食堂）的意见，然后通过代表讨论提交生产队或食堂解决。生活代表会除了监督食堂粮食安排、审查用粮计划和根据农事季节、农活轻重，随时调剂用粮指标外，还有权检查炊事管理人员的工作，以及讨论决定生活上其它重大问题。
    口粮一次安排到明夏
    湖南宁乡县白马桥公社珍洲大队，发动群众核实产量，把到明年早稻收获时为止的口粮一次安排到食堂（指标确定到户），并且把实物如数拨交食堂，由食堂和生产大队共同管理。
    这个大队安排好粮食的一个月多，各食堂严格执行了按定量用粮，没有一家一户超过用粮指标，全队还节约粮食四千多斤。
    用粮吃菜“十个月早知道”
    河北定县韩家洼公社皮家庄生产队各食堂，推行用粮吃菜“十个月早知道”和“十日饭食表”，受到群众普遍欢迎。
    实行上述办法后，归纳起来主要有以下两点好处：（一）社员和食堂管理人员心里有底，因此可以认真执行计划用粮吃菜；（二）促进了食堂的民主管理。
    大抓“食堂五件事”
    甘肃平凉市为了搞好群众生活，大抓“食堂五件事”：小锅小蒸笼改大锅大蒸笼；推广自动吹风炉灶；加工面粉改畜力旱磨为水力动力磨和风力“飞轮磨”；组织专业队为食堂拉煤炭；建立蔬菜基地。
    目前，全市一千八百九十个食堂，已有41％实现了“五件事”的要求，有效地提高了食堂的经营管理水平，同时全市各食堂一共减少了炊事员、管理员、粮食加工员大约二千人，加工粮食的牲畜一千二百头。
    推行“帮厨”制度
    山西运城开弢公社石桥管理区共青号食堂最近推行了“帮厨”制度。这个制度规定：在食堂吃饭的干部要轮流下伙房“帮厨”；每十个社员中选一名代表轮流“帮厨”。这个食堂还组织社员利用业余时间，每半月举行一次“爱堂日”，主要是帮助食堂人员搞家底生产。因为“帮厨”已形成制度，这个食堂已经精简了一些炊事人员投入农业生产。
    瞻前顾后计划用粮
    山西文水县胡兰公社保先管理区去年因水灾减产，社员们在党支部领导下，瞻前顾后，细水长流，计划用粮，节约用粮。今年，全区九个食堂已有七个食堂节余粮食共六千多斤。由于生活安排得好，社员们在去年遭受水灾的基础上，今年又战胜了干旱，全区粮食总产量比去年增长23.8％。
    储足燃料节约燃料
    甘肃临洮县辛甸人民公社巴下寺生产队以食堂为中心，一面大抓燃料储备，一面改革旧式炉灶，节约燃料。现在，全队已为食堂储备了十个月的燃料。另外，还为社员家庭过冬取暖储备了大批柴草。从8月份以来，这个生产队发动群众，结合大秋收和“小秋收”，采取上地不空手，下工背一篓的办法，割柴拾草三十多万斤。第一小队食堂经过整修树枝，储备烧柴十万多斤。全队已将七个食堂原来一炉一锅的改为一炉多锅，既能烧煤，又能烧柴，更能烧茅草。
