Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th - Henan Province is accelerating the progress of cotton picking, purchasing, and processing. The amount of cotton purchased is increasing every ten days. The second ten days of October saw an increase of 23% compared to the middle ten days of October, and the first ten days of November saw another increase of 38% compared to the last ten days of October. Since November, the average daily amount of ginned cotton processed has increased by about 60% compared to the average daily amount processed in October.

Recently, Party committees in cotton-producing areas have seized the favorable opportunity of the nearing end of the "Three Autumns" and further strengthened their leadership over cotton picking, purchasing, and processing. Nanyang, Xinxiang, Xinye and other major cotton-producing cities and counties have rationally stipulated quotas in cotton picking based on the principle of more work, more gain, implemented rewards for those who exceed the quotas, and adopted the methods of "four separations" (separate picking, separate drying, separate selling, separate ginning) and "three finding" (finding fallen cotton, finding stiff-petal cotton, finding "eyelashes") to achieve precise picking and fine sorting, and complete picking and cleaning. As a result of these measures, the cotton picking speed of many communes has doubled compared to before, and the quality of cotton has generally improved by one grade. The broad masses of commune members also actively brought drying tools to the fields, picking, drying, and selling cotton as they went, and collectives enthusiastically sold cotton to the state.

In purchasing, commercial departments, in addition to increasing the number of purchasing stations and improving purchasing methods, also conscientiously implemented democratic grading methods and implemented the policy of high-quality, high-price purchasing.

Various localities, with state-owned processing plants as the backbone, and with communes and production brigades (basic accounting units) establishing processing plants in a planned way, and with various indigenous and foreign processing machines working together, have greatly accelerated the progress of cotton processing. Since the beginning of November, more than 200 state-owned processing plants in the province have all started operation one after another, and the number of processing plants run by communes and teams has also increased by 31% compared to the end of October, with more than 6,200 folk ginning machines put into processing.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 20th - The masses in various parts of Sichuan have set off a wave of autumn blitzing, picking, and selling oilseeds. Wusheng, Yilong, Yibin and other counties have completed this year's peanut purchasing task ahead of schedule.

This year, Sichuan Province has conscientiously implemented various policies in the autumn oilseed purchasing work. For peanuts, the main oilseed in large quantities, from the beginning, the policy of taking into account the three aspects of the state, the collective, and the individual was implemented, the purchasing targets were implemented, and clear regulations were made for the peanuts retained for use and consumption. For example, Yilong County, due to the correct implementation of the Party's policies, not only fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the commune members to carefully dig and harvest, but also closely integrated the picking, selling, and distribution work. By October 13, the county had completed the peanut purchasing task.

For the purchase of wild oilseeds and minor oilseeds, various localities have also achieved remarkable results through publicizing policies, rationally distributing income, and making overall arrangements for labor. For example, Hongya County completed this year's Camellia oleifera seed purchasing plan ahead of schedule by the end of October, with the purchasing volume increasing by more than double compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 20th - While grasping cotton picking and purchasing, cotton-growing areas in Zhejiang Province are vigorously grasping cotton processing and transportation. As of November 15, the amount of ginned cotton processed in the province has accounted for more than 60% of the amount purchased, and 330,000 dan of ginned cotton have been transported to Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places to supply the needs of the textile industry.

This year, Zhejiang Province has fully utilized the processing equipment of the communes while fully utilizing the state-owned cotton processing plants, thus accelerating the progress of cotton processing. Linhai County organized commune-run industries to specialize in processing seed cotton, so as to gin and store by team, and select and retain excellent cotton seeds for next year's production.

Various localities have strived to reform processing machinery, so that cotton processing work can meet the requirements of high quality, high yield, low consumption, and safety. At present, many factories have realized automatic feeding of roller gins, automatic conveying of seed cotton, ginned cotton, and cottonseed, and basically eliminated the heavy labor of packing.

Party committees at all levels, according to the amount of purchase, warehouse capacity, transportation tasks, and vehicle and ship transportation conditions, organized various departments of industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation to carry out large-scale cooperation to quickly transport cotton to cotton textile factories in Hangzhou, Shanghai and other places, to produce various cotton textiles for the people.

    加快棉花油料采售加工进度
    河南贯彻优质优价政策群众踊跃售棉  四川掀起交售家生油料野生油料热潮
    浙江调运大批皮棉供应纺织工业需要
    据新华社郑州20日电河南省棉花采摘、收购、加工进度加快。棉花收购量逐旬上升，10月下旬比中旬上升23％，11月上旬又比10月下旬上升38％；11月份以来，平均每日加工的皮棉数量较10月份每日平均加工量上升60％左右。
    最近，各产棉地区党委都抓紧“三秋”基本结束的有利时机，进一步加强了对于棉花采摘、收购、加工工作的领导。主要产棉区南阳、新乡、新野等市、县，根据多劳多得的原则，在棉花采摘中合理规定定额，对超额者实行奖励兑现，并采取“四分”（分摘、分晒、分售、分轧），和“三找”（找落地棉、找僵瓣棉、找“眼睫毛”）的办法，达到精摘细分，摘光拣净的目的。由于采取这些办法，不少公社的摘棉速度较前加快一倍，棉花质量普遍提高一个等级。广大社员还主动把晾晒棉花的工具带到田间，随摘、随晒、随售，集体踊跃向国家交售棉花。
    商业部门在收购中除增设收购站和改进收购方法外，还认真实行了民主评级的办法，贯彻优质优价收购政策。
    各地以国家加工厂为骨干，公社、生产大队（基本核算单位）有计划地建立加工厂，各种土洋加工机具一齐上阵，促使棉花加工进度大大加快。进入11月份以来，全省二百多个国营加工厂，已先后全部开工，社队办的加工厂也比10月底增加了31％，投入加工的各种民间土轧车达六千二百多部。
    据新华社成都20日电　四川各地群众掀起了秋季突击采摘、交售油料的热潮。武胜、仪陇、宜宾等县已提前完成今年的花生收购任务。
    今年，四川省各地在秋季油料收购工作中，认真贯彻各项政策。对大宗的主要油料花生，从一开始，就贯彻了国家、集体、个人三方面兼顾的政策，落实收购指标，对于留用、留吃的花生也作了明确的规定。如仪陇县由于正确贯彻党的政策，不但充分调动了社员群众精挖细收的积极性，而且使采摘、交售、分配工作紧密结合起来。到10月13日，全县就完成了花生收购任务。
    对于野生油料和小宗油料的收购，各地也通过宣传政策，合理分配收益，统筹安排劳力，取得显著成绩。如洪雅县到10月底就提前完成了今年的油茶子的收购计划，收购量比去年增长一倍以上。
    据新华社杭州20日电　浙江省各棉区在抓紧棉花采摘、收购的同时，狠抓棉花加工、调运工作。到11月15日止，全省加工的籽棉已占收购量的60％以上，并已有三十三万担皮棉运往上海、杭州等地供应纺织工业的需要。
    浙江省今年在充分利用国营棉花加工厂加工的同时，还充分利用了公社的加工设备，因而加快了棉花加工的进度。临海县组织社办工业专门加工种籽棉，作到按队分轧、分存，为明年生产选留优良棉种。
    各地都努力改革加工机具，使棉花加工工作达到优质、高产、低耗、安全的要求。目前，不少厂已实现了皮辊机自动喂花，籽棉、皮棉、棉籽自动输送，基本上消灭了打包的笨重劳动。
    各级党委根据收购数量、仓库容量、调运任务和车船运输情况，组织工农商交各部门大搞协作，把棉花迅速运到杭州、上海等地的棉纺织厂，为人民生产各种棉纺织品。
