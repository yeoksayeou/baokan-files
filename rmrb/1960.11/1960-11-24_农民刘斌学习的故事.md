　　"Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is a compass,
　　Every sentence is accurate.
　　Thousands of words for the workers and peasants,
　　It is a beacon for the road.

　　These are the four sentences that old farmer Liu Bin wrote in his notebook, unable to contain the excitement in his heart after reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong".

　　Liu Bin is from Tangjian Village, Wuzhai County, Northwestern Shanxi. In Shanxi Province, everyone knows that he has persisted in studying theory for nine years, learning, applying, and propagating it simultaneously. He is a banner for workers and peasants studying Mao Zedong's works.

　　This farmer is over half a century old, but his spirit is still strong. He often says happily: "I'm not old yet, I'm no different from young people. Niu Buquan, the model student of theory in Xinding County, said it well, 'The setting sun shines on the gray-haired old man, Marxism-Leninism gives youth,' and I also feel that the more I study Chairman Mao's works, the younger I become."

　　Whether it is a spring dusk or a midnight in late autumn, whether it is a hot summer night or a snowy winter dawn, a dim light always shines through his window, reflecting his trembling figure. In the house, a small square table is placed on the warm kang, on which are classic works such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Collected Works of Stalin," "Collected Works of Lenin," and various theoretical books, newspapers, and propaganda pamphlets. He always sits upright on the side of the table with his legs crossed, reading attentively. Many of his books are old and worn, with various marks drawn in red and blue pens between the lines.

　　Every morning, he is the first to appear on the street, using a loudspeaker to publicize major domestic and foreign events and the Party's policies. During the day, he works in the fields, always working first and finishing last, and he is a labor model every year. In the evening, in the farmers' theoretical night school, he enthusiastically propagates Mao Zedong Thought to everyone...

　　In 1951, Liu Bin was elected as the cultural and educational committee member of his village, and the Party branch also absorbed him as a propagandist. Liu Bin's heart was warm when he became a propagandist. But what to propagate? How to propagate to the masses? He was stumped again. Once, District Committee Secretary Guo Lun said: "Party propagandists should not only read newspapers every day, but more importantly, they should often read Chairman Mao's articles." These two sentences greatly enlightened Liu Bin's thinking. A few days later, he ran to the Xinhua Bookstore in Shenchi Town, fifty miles away, in one breath.

　　Liu Bin pays close attention to rural issues when reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." In particular, he liked the "Fourteen Major Issues" in the article "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" in the first volume. First of all, he understood the meaning of "popularizing political propaganda," which is to universally publicize the Party's policies and guidelines and Chairman Mao's instructions to the masses. From then on, he gradually explored a way of propaganda, which is to closely combine the Chairman Mao's words he learned with the various policies currently implemented by the Party and the state in the countryside and vigorously publicize them.

　　In 1957, some primary school graduates in the village failed to enter middle school and were not at ease in rural labor production. At this time, Liu Bin saw the news in the newspaper that Li Shunda was running an amateur middle school in the countryside. He was so happy that he patted his thigh and ran to the Party branch with the newspaper.

　　"Look! Look, Li Shunda is running a rural amateur middle school, let's run one too! Chairman Mao said that it won't work if there are no cultural talents in the countryside!"

　　The Party branch agreed to his suggestion and strongly supported him in running it. After mobilizing the masses, everyone expressed their agreement at the meeting, but after the meeting, they were not so enthusiastic. Liu Bin was not discouraged at all, and propagated the significance of the cultural movement to everyone door-to-door. He said:

　　"Chairman Mao has long said: 'In the past, only landlords had culture in China, and peasants had no culture. However, the landlord's culture was created by the peasants, because the things that created the landlord's culture were none other than the blood and sweat plundered from the peasants. Ninety percent of the people in China have not received cultural education, and the vast majority of them are peasants.' Peasants are us. In the past, only the sons of four landlords in our village had culture, and we were all illiterate. Because we had no culture, we suffered so much injustice. Today, the Party and Chairman Mao asked us to run schools so that our children and grandchildren can become educated peasants. Shouldn't we hurry up and do it?"

　　After his propaganda, people felt bright in their hearts, and the amateur middle school class was indeed set up.

　　Liu Bin's family of five relies entirely on him alone to work and maintain a living, and the economy is not well-off. But in order to study theory, in recent years, he has tightened his belt, saving money on food and clothing, and bought more than 170 theoretical books.

　　Liu Bin not only studies by himself, but also tries to help others study. He often delivers "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and other theoretical books to the doorsteps of his fellow villagers.

　　"Old fellow, study Chairman Mao's works, this is 'Marxism-Leninism happiness scripture, the more peasants learn, the smarter they become.' Chairman Mao says what is in our hearts, and once you read it, you understand it, and the more you read it, the more you want to read it." So people took the book with a smile and started reading it. In the past few years, Liu Bin has helped and motivated cadres and peasants in his village to study theory, and by the end of 1959, it had developed to sixty-six people.

    农民刘斌学习的故事
    樊述贤　张敏
    《毛泽东选集》是指南针，
    句句话儿说得准。
    千言万语为工农，
    它是行路指明灯。
    这是老农民刘斌读了《毛泽东选集》按捺不住心头的激动，在笔记本上写下的四句话。
    刘斌是晋西北五寨县塘涧村人，在山西省谁都知道他九年坚持学理论，边学边用边宣传，是工农学习毛泽东著作的一面旗帜。
    这位农民年过半百了，然而精神却很旺盛。他常乐呵呵地说：“我还不老，和年青人没两样，忻定县学理论标兵牛补全老汉说得好，‘桑榆晚景白头翁，马列主义给青春’，我也觉着学毛主席的著作越学越年青了。”
    无论是春天的黄昏，还是深秋的子夜，也无论是酷热的夏夜，还是大雪纷飞寒冬的黎明，他的窗上老是透着微亮的灯光，映着他那颤巍巍的身影。屋里的暖炕上摆着一个小方桌，上面放着《毛泽东选集》、《斯大林全集》、《列宁文集》等经典著作和各类理论书籍、报纸杂志、宣传小册子。他老是端庄地盘腿坐在桌旁，全神贯注地阅读。他的好多书已经破旧了，字里行间用红笔和蓝笔画着各种记号。
    每天清晨，他就第一个出现在街上，用广播筒宣传国内外大事和党的方针政策。白天在地里干活，老是干在先收工在后，年年是劳动模范。晚上在农民理论夜校，他热情奔放地向大家宣传毛泽东思想……。
    1951年，刘斌被选为本村的文教委员，党支部又吸收他为宣传员。刘斌当了宣传员心里热乎乎的。可是宣传什么？怎样向群众宣传？又把他难住了。有一次区委书记郭纶说：“党的宣传员不仅每天要看报纸，而且更重要的是经常阅读毛主席的文章。”这两句话大大启发了刘斌的思想。过了几天，他就一口气跑到五十里以外的神池镇新华书店。
    刘斌阅读《毛泽东选集》十分留意有关农村的问题。特别是第一卷《湖南农民运动考察报告》一文中的“十四件”大事，他看了非常喜欢。首先领会了“普及政治宣传”的意义，就是向群众普遍宣传党的政策方针和毛主席的指示。从此，他逐步摸索到一条宣传门路，就是把学习到的毛主席的话，紧密结合当前党和国家在农村中实行的各项政策，大力宣传。
    1957年村里有一部分完小毕业生没有考上中学，不安心在农村劳动生产。这时，刘斌在报纸上看到李顺达在农村办业余中学的消息，高兴得他直拍大腿，忙拿着报纸一溜烟地跑到党支部。
    “看！看，李顺达办农村业余中学啦，咱们也办个吧！毛主席说农村没有文化人材不行啊！”
    党支部同意他的建议，并大力支持他办，经过动员群众，会上大家都表示同意，但会后就不那么热火了。刘斌一点儿也不泄气，沿门逐户向大家宣传文化运动的意义。他说：
    “毛主席早已说过：‘中国历来只有地主有文化，农民没有文化。可是地主的文化是由农民造成的，因为造成地主文化的东西，不是别的，正是从农民身上掠取的血汗。中国有百分之九十未受文化教育的人民，这个里面，最大多数是农民。’农民就是咱们，过去咱们村只有四家地主的儿子有文化，咱们都是睁眼瞎。因为没有文化，不知受了多少冤枉苦。今天党和毛主席叫咱办学校，使咱的儿孙后代都成为有文化的农民，这还不赶紧办？”
    经他这样宣传，人们就心里亮堂堂的了，业余中学班果然办起来了。
    刘斌全家五口人，全靠他一个人劳动维持生活，经济并不宽裕。但他为了学理论，最近几年来，节衣缩食，买了一百七十来本理论书籍。
    刘斌不仅自己学习，还想方设法帮助别人学习。常把《毛泽东选集》等理论书籍给乡亲们送上门去。
    “老伙计，学学毛主席著作吧，这是‘马列主义幸福经，农民越学越聪明’，毛主席尽说的咱心窝窝里的话，一看就懂，越看越想看。”于是人们笑嘻嘻地把书接过去看起来。几年来，刘斌帮助、带动本村的干部、农民学理论，到1959年底发展到六十六人。
