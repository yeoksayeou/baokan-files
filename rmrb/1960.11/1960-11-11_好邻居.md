    Good Neighbors
    Wang Weifu, a worker from the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Department, has been particularly busy these past few days. His wife is about to give birth, and after work each day, he has to do some housework. What particularly worries him is that he hasn't bought the coal for heating and the vegetables for winter storage. Also, when his wife gives birth, someone will need to call the doctor and take care of her during the postpartum period.
    The head of the residents' group, Hu Aixiang, found out about this. She thought, "The factory is very busy with production right now. If we take over Wang Weifu's household chores, he can devote all his energy to building more blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces for the country, and make more steel." With this in mind, Hu Aixiang immediately went to find Zhang Yan and Hu Xiuzhi. The three of them went to Wang Weifu's house and started working separately. One went to buy coal and vegetables, one went to fetch water and pickle vegetables, and one cleaned the house. Soon, everything was done. Coincidentally, just at that moment, Wang Weifu's wife was about to give birth. The three of them busied themselves calling the midwife, cooking food... After the child was born, they took turns taking care of the mother, wrapping the baby... They took care of everything perfectly.
    At eleven o'clock at night, Wang Weifu returned home. As soon as he entered, he understood everything. He said excitedly to Hu Aixiang and the others, "You are so good, you solved a big problem for me. I will definitely guarantee full attendance and answer you with a full red banner of success!" Hu Aixiang said modestly, "Doing this little thing is nothing, we are helping each other as neighbors, all to support steelmaking!" (Hu Zongkui) (Attached picture)

    好邻居
    鞍钢修建部工人王维复这几天特别忙。爱人快临产了，他每天下班以后，还得做些家务事，特别使他发愁的是，家里烧的煤和冬季储存菜还没有买，爱人生孩子总还得有人给请医生和侍候“月子”等等。
    这件事，被居民小组长胡爱香知道了。她想：“现在厂里生产很忙，如果我们把王维复的家务事给包下来，他就可以把全副精力都用来为国家多修建高炉、平炉，多炼钢铁。”想到这里，胡爱香马上去找张燕和胡秀芝，三个人来到王维复家里，就分头干起来了，一人去买煤、买菜，一人去挑水渍菜，一人搞室内卫生，很快就把一切都做好了。可巧，正在这个时候，王维复的爱人要生孩子。她们三个人又忙着请助产士、煮饭……。小孩生下来以后，她们又分头照顾产妇，包裹小孩，……一切事情都料理得妥妥贴贴。
    夜里十一点钟，王维复回到家里。进门一看，什么都明白了。他激动地对胡爱香她们说：“你们太好了，给我解决了心上的一个大难题。我一定保证出满勤，以满堂红的成绩来回答你们！”胡爱香却谦逊地说：“做这点事算得了什么，咱们邻里互助，都是为了支援炼钢啊！”　　　（胡宗魁）（附图片）
