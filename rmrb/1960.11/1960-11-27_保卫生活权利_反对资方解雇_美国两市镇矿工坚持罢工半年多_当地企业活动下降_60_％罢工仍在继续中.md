Xinhua News Agency, 26th: New York dispatch: According to the "New York Post," a miners' strike in northern Idaho has persisted for half a year.

In the towns of Wallace and Kellogg, Idaho, which rely on mining and smelting, approximately 2,600 workers' strike has paralyzed the mining and smelting businesses in these two towns for six months.

According to the report, the strikers are members of Local 18 of the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, who are demanding wage increases and opposing layoffs.

The strike has caused huge losses to the capitalists. The "New York Post" wrote that "business activity in the area is estimated to have declined by 60%. Merchants are distressed." The "New York Post" said that this strike is the longest in Idaho's history, and it seems that there will be no hope of a resolution in the coming weeks.

    美国两市镇矿工坚持罢工半年多
    当地企业活动下降60％罢工仍在继续中
    新华社26日讯　纽约消息：据《纽约邮报》报道，美国爱达荷州北部的一个地区，矿业和冶炼工人的罢工已坚持半年之久。
    在这个州的以开采和冶炼为业的华莱士和克洛格市镇，大约二千六百名工人的罢工已使这两个市镇的采矿和冶炼企业瘫痪了六个月。
    据报纸报道，举行罢工的是国际开采冶炼工人工会第十八地方分会的会员，他们要求增加工资和反对解雇。
    这次罢工使资本家遭到巨大损失。《纽约邮报》写道，这个地区的“企业活动估计下降了60％。商人们感到苦恼”。《纽约邮报》说，这次罢工是爱达荷州历史上为时最长的一次罢工，而且看来在今后许多星期中还不会有解决的希望。
