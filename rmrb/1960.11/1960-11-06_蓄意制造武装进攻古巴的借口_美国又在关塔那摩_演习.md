Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 5th: As the United States intensifies its plot for armed intervention in Cuba, the U.S. Marines once again held a large-scale, twenty-four-hour military "exercise" on November 4th at the Guantanamo Naval Base it occupies in Cuba.

This exercise, under the guise of "defense," cannot conceal its aggressive nature in the slightest. A United Press International dispatch on November 5th openly admitted that this was "an act of displaying military might."

Participating in this military "exercise" were three thousand Marines and three hundred and seven U.S. Navy officers from the United States. The dispatch stated that this "exercise" was conducted within the forty-five square miles of Guantanamo. After the U.S. Navy issued a three-minute "under bombardment" alert, the Marines rushed out from the base's airport, factories, and other locations, launching a "simulated" battle under the cover of tanks and jet fighters.

Prior to this military "exercise," Smith, commander of the U.S. Tenth Naval District in charge of the Guantanamo base, blatantly clamored that the U.S. Marines have been stepping up "defensive" preparations against Cuba.

    蓄意制造武装进攻古巴的借口
    美国又在关塔那摩“演习”
    新华社5日讯　哈瓦那消息：正当美国加紧阴谋武装干涉古巴的时候，美国海军陆战队4日再次在它霸占古巴的关塔那摩海军基地举行一次二十四小时的大规模军事“演习”。
    这次以“防御”为名的演习，丝毫也不能掩饰它的侵略性质。合众国际社5日消息明白承认，这是“一次显示武力的行动”。
    参加这次军事“演习”的有来自美国的三千名海军陆战队和三百零七名美国海军军官。消息说，这次“演习”是在关塔那摩四十五平方英里的地区内进行的。当美国海军发出三分钟的“遭到轰击”的警报以后，海军陆战队从基地的机场、厂房以及其他地方冲出，在坦克和喷气战斗机的掩护下发动了“假想的”战斗。
    在这次军事“演习”以前，负责关塔那摩基地的美国第十海军军区司令斯密斯公然叫嚣，美国海军陆战队一直在加紧对古巴的“防御”准备。
