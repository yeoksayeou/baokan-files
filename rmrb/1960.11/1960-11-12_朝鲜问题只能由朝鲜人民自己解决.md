The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a memorandum on the peaceful reunification of Korea on the 11th. With a large number of irrefutable facts, it exposed the deceptive nature of the tenth "annual report" and "supplementary report" submitted by the so-called "United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" to the current United Nations General Assembly; firmly demanded that the U.S. troops who are misusing the United Nations banner to forcibly occupy South Korea immediately withdraw from South Korea, and demanded the dissolution of the "United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," which is being used as a tool to implement the U.S. policy of aggression; and emphasized that the Korean question should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The Chinese people fully support the solemn position of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and support these just demands that fully conform to the interests of the Korean people and the interests of world peace.

The so-called "United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" is a tool for aggression against Korea manufactured by U.S. imperialism operating its voting machine at the United Nations General Assembly ten years ago. For the past ten years, the "annual reports" submitted by this commission have served the despicable conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to permanently divide Korea and turn South Korea into its colony and military base. This year's "annual report" as usual says that the "prospect of unification" of Korea "is remote," and reverses black and white by placing the responsibility on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, insisting that this is due to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's refusal to accept "United Nations resolutions." This "annual report" shamelessly glorifies the puppet "government" of South Korea and the status quo in South Korea, and continues to insist on absurd proposals such as Korean "elections under United Nations supervision." U.S. imperialism, using the review of this "annual report" as an excuse, once again forced the Fifteenth United Nations General Assembly to include the "Korean question" on the agenda.

For the past fifteen years, Korea has been artificially divided into two parts, north and south, entirely as a result of U.S. imperialism's forcible occupation of South Korea and its policy of division towards Korea. U.S. imperialism has come up with various excuses to cover up its crimes of aggression; however, these excuses are completely untenable. The United States insists on so-called "free elections" in Korea "under United Nations supervision." However, everyone knows that the war of aggression against Korea launched by the United States was carried out under the banner of the United Nations. The United Nations is a belligerent party in the Korean War, and it has no right to supervise elections in Korea. U.S. imperialists insist on this absurd proposal in order to impose the will of one belligerent party on the other, and to deliberately obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

At the same time, South Korea is still under the threat of the bayonets of the U.S. invading army, and there is no possibility of any free elections. The "freedom" of this kind of election, as revealed in the memorandum, is that the separate "election" in South Korea on May 10, 1948, "under United Nations supervision," was conducted under the murderous atmosphere of the total mobilization of the U.S. occupying forces and the Syngman Rhee terrorist organization. The French newspaper "Combat" said that Syngman Rhee was able to gain a majority in this election "with the help of American bayonets and tanks, and at the cost of sacrificing three hundred and twenty-three deaths, including thirty-two policemen, and one thousand wounded." However, the United Nations personnel who were in charge of "supervising" the "election" at the time said that the "election" was conducted in a "free atmosphere," guaranteeing the people's expression of "free will." It is not difficult to understand that the "freedom" in the mouths of United Nations personnel is not the freedom of the people, but the freedom of executioners to kill. And Syngman Rhee, the "president" who had been repeatedly elected in that so-called "free election," has been overthrown by the people who could no longer tolerate him; another ugly farce of a new "free election" is being directed by the United States, with another U.S. puppet, Chang Myon, replacing Syngman Rhee. The July 29 election, which the "United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" praised as a "free," "very satisfactory" election conducted "under United Nations supervision," was similarly conducted by means of suppression and deception. In this election, Chang Myon's "Democratic Party," in order to win votes, colluded with Huh Chung's "transitional government," used money to deceive, and adopted despicable means such as forging ballots, voting by proxy, exchanging ballots, fabricating ghost voter lists, casting large bundles of votes, and miscalculating votes during the vote count; according to the data shrunk and published by the South Korean police, from June 24 to August 3, more than 17,500 innocent people were arrested. Therefore, voters in various parts of South Korea have demanded the return of ballots, attacked polling places, burned ballot boxes, and declared the election invalid. The slogan "Chang Myon cabinet get down" resounded throughout southern Korea, while the U.S. State Department issued a statement on October 11, saying that it had "complete confidence" in the Chang Myon group and demanded that the South Korean people give the Chang Myon group "full support."

All these facts have repeatedly proved that the "election under United Nations supervision" that U.S. imperialism is vigorously promoting is to obstruct the real peaceful reunification of Korea, and to expand the criminal rule of the South Korean puppet government controlled by the United States to northern Korea, turning the entire Korea into its colony and military base.

This conspiracy of U.S. imperialism will never succeed. Because the broad masses of the Korean people, from their own experience, have fully realized that the deep disasters of the Korean nation do not come from elsewhere, but from U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea. As long as the U.S. aggressors do not leave South Korea and the U.S. interference in Korea does not stop, the flames of the Korean people's struggle will not be extinguished. In March and April of this year, the South Korean people, regardless of the bloody suppression by the U.S.-Rhee reactionaries, persevered in their struggle for dozens of days. The angry masses in Seoul stormed into the Syngman Rhee group's pseudo-government, burned down the headquarters of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party and other strongholds of counter-revolutionary forces, and smashed the bronze statue of MacArthur, the head of the U.S. invading forces in Korea. In an instant, an important base for U.S. aggression in Asia turned into a volcano. This struggle storm of the South Korean people against the U.S.-Rhee fascist rule began with the protest against the Syngman Rhee group's "presidential election." However, the "election" was only the fuse that ignited this struggle. This struggle is the general outbreak of the accumulated anger of the South Korean people who have been enslaved by U.S. aggressors for fifteen years. The fascist rule of the U.S.-Rhee group for more than ten years has turned South Korea into a living hell. South Korea's economy is bankrupt, and there are millions of unemployed and hungry people everywhere. Last year alone, as many as 270,000 people were imprisoned and massacred by the U.S.-Rhee group! To what extent has the South Korean people's anger at the fascist terror rule of the U.S.-Rhee group reached! Now, U.S. imperialism is using the "report" of the so-called "United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" to cover up its ugliness, which only proves once again that it still wants to赖下去 in South Korea unreasonably, continue to enslave the Korean people, and use South Korea as its base of aggression, threatening peace in Asia and the world.

In order to peacefully reunify Korea, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly proposed reasonable solutions, advocating that after all foreign troops have completely withdrawn from South Korea, free general elections should be held throughout Korea in accordance with the will of the Korean people without any external interference; and it has also suggested reducing the military forces of both North and South Korea, developing economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides; and representatives from North and South Korea should sit down to discuss the major plans for peaceful reunification. This is a truly practical way to peacefully resolve the Korean question. However, these suggestions have all been opposed by U.S. imperialism. At the celebration of the fifteenth anniversary of Korea's liberation this year, Premier Kim Il-sung, on behalf of the Korean government, also put forward a new plan for the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, advocating the implementation of the Korean federal system in northern Korea and southern Korea as a transitional measure to solve the problem of peaceful reunification of Korea. This plan has won the praise and support of the people all over the world, and has also been warmly supported by the people of North and South Korea. If the United States is really "willing" to realize the reunification of Korea, as it says it is, what reason is there to refuse the suggestions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea? U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to undermine Korea's realization of reunification and attempt to permanently occupy South Korea can never be covered up by any "report" that the "United Nations Commission on the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" it manipulates makes in the United Nations General Assembly to reverse black and white.

The Chinese people have always believed that the Korean question can only be resolved by the Korean people themselves. As a belligerent party, the United Nations' discussion of the "Korean question" under the manipulation of the United States and the exclusion of the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is completely illegal, and therefore any resolution it makes is invalid. For the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, the United States must stop using the name of the United Nations to interfere in Korea, and the U.S. invading army must immediately and completely withdraw from South Korea.

### 朝鲜问题只能由朝鲜人民自己解决

    朝鲜问题只能由朝鲜人民自己解决
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府11日发表关于朝鲜和平统一的备忘录。它以大量无可辩驳的事实，揭穿了所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”向本届联合国大会提出的第十次“年度报告”和“补充报告”的欺骗性质；坚决要求盗用联合国招牌强占南朝鲜的美国军队立即从南朝鲜撤走，要求解散被利用作执行美国侵略政策工具的“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”；并着重提出朝鲜问题应由朝鲜人民自己解决等主张。中国人民完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的严正立场，支持这些完全符合朝鲜人民利益和世界和平利益的正义要求。
    所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”，是十年前美帝国主义在联合国大会开动它的表决机器制造出来的侵略朝鲜的工具。十年来，这个委员会历次提出的“年度报告”，都是为美帝国主义的永远分裂朝鲜、把南朝鲜变成它的殖民地和军事基地的卑鄙阴谋服务。今年的“年度报告”照例说，朝鲜的
  “统一的展望是遥远的”，并且颠倒黑白地把责任推到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国身上，硬说这是由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国不接受“联合国的决议”所造成的。这个“年度报告”厚颜无耻地为南朝鲜的傀儡“政府”和南朝鲜的现状涂脂抹粉，并且继续坚持朝鲜“在联合国监督下的选举”等等荒谬主张。美帝国主义以审查这个“年度报告”作为借口，又一次强迫十五届联合国大会把
  “朝鲜问题”列入议程。
    十五年来，朝鲜被人为地分裂为南北两部分，完全是美帝国主义强占南朝鲜和它对朝鲜实行分裂政策的结果。美帝国主义为了掩盖它的侵略罪行，想出各种借口；但是，这些借口是完全站不住脚的。美国坚持朝鲜在“联合国监督下”实行所谓“自由选举”。但是，谁都知道，美国所发动的侵朝战争，是盗用联合国的名义进行的。联合国是朝鲜战争的交战一方，它根本无权监督朝鲜的选举。美帝国主义者坚持这种荒谬的主张，就是把交战一方的意志强加给另一方，就是蓄意阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    同时，目前南朝鲜还在美国侵略军的刺刀威胁下，也根本不可能有什么自由选举。这种选举的“自由”，正如备忘录中所揭露的，1948年5月10日在
  “联合国监督下”的南朝鲜单独“选举”，是在美国占领军和李承晚恐怖组织总动员的杀气腾腾的气氛下进行的。法国“战斗报”说：李承晚在这次选举中所以能够占多数，是“借助于美国刺刀和坦克取得的，是用牺牲包括三十二名警察的三百二十三名死亡者和一千名负伤者的代价取得的”。但是，当时担任“监督”“选举”工作的联合国人员却说，“选举”在“自由气氛”中进行，保障了人民表示“自由意志”。这就不难明白，联合国人员嘴里的“自由”，不是什么人民的自由，而是刽子手们杀人的自由。而曾经一再在那种所谓“自由选举”中当选的“总统”李承晚，已经被忍无可忍的人民推翻了；新的“自由选举”的丑剧又在美国导演下，以另一个美国傀儡张勉代替李承晚。“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”所称道的这一次“自由的”、“非常满意的”、在“联合国监视下”进行的7月29日的选举，同样是用镇压和欺骗手段进行的。在这次选举中，张勉的“民主党”为了夺取选票，和许政的“过渡政府”勾结，利用金钱进行欺骗，采取了伪造选票、代理投票、换票、捏造幽灵选举者名单、投大捆票、开票时错算选票等卑鄙手段；据南朝鲜警察缩小发表的资料，从6月24日到8月3日，还逮捕了一万七千五百多名无辜人民。因此，南朝鲜的各地选民，纷纷要求退回选票，袭击选举场所，烧掉投票箱，宣告选举无效。“张勉内阁滚下来”的口号响遍朝鲜南部，而美国国务院竟在10月11日发表声明，说什么对张勉集团“完全有信心”，并且要求南朝鲜人民给张勉集团“全力的支持”。
    所有这些事实，都一再证明，美帝国主义所极力宣扬的“在联合国监督下进行选举”，就是要阻挠朝鲜的真正和平统一，而把美国所控制的南朝鲜傀儡政府的罪恶统治，扩大到朝鲜北部，把整个朝鲜变为它的殖民地和军事基地。
    美帝国主义的这种阴谋诡计，是永远不可能得逞的。因为，广大的朝鲜人民，从他们的切身体验，已经完全清楚地认识到，朝鲜民族的深重灾难，不是来自别的地方，而是来自美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略。美国侵略者一天不离开南朝鲜，美国对朝鲜的干涉一天不停止，朝鲜人民的斗争烈火就一天不会熄灭。今年3、4月间，南朝鲜人民不顾美李反动派的血腥镇压，前仆后继，坚持斗争达几十天。汉城的愤怒群众冲进李承晚集团伪政府，烧毁了李承晚的自由党总部等反革命势力的大本营，砸毁侵朝美军头子麦克阿瑟的铜像。转瞬之间，美国侵略亚洲的一个重要基地变成了火山。南朝鲜人民的这场反对美李法西斯统治的斗争风暴，是从抗议李承晚集团的“总统选举”开始的。然而，“选举”不过是引起这场斗争的导火线。这场斗争是十五年来在美国侵略者奴役下的南朝鲜人民久已蕴积的怒火的总爆发。美李集团十几年的法西斯统治，使南朝鲜变成一座人间地狱。南朝鲜的经济破产，到处是千千万万失业和饥饿的人群。去年一年，被美李集团监禁和屠杀的人民就达二十七万人！南朝鲜人民对于美李集团法西斯恐怖统治的愤怒已经到了何种程度！现在，美帝国主义利用所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”的“报告”来遮丑，只不过再一次证明，它还要蛮横无理地在南朝鲜赖下去，继续奴役朝鲜人民，把南朝鲜作为它的侵略基地，威胁亚洲和世界和平。
    为了和平统一朝鲜，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾一再提出合理的方案，主张在一切外国军队全部撤出南朝鲜以后，在没有任何外力干涉的情况下，根据朝鲜人民的意志，进行全朝鲜的自由普选；并且还建议裁减南北朝鲜的军队，发展双方的经济文化交流；南北朝鲜的代表坐下来协商和平统一大计。这是和平解决朝鲜问题的真正切实可行的办法。但是这些建议竟都遭到美帝国主义的反对。在今年朝鲜解放十五周年纪念会上，金日成首相又代表朝鲜政府提出了关于和平解决朝鲜问题的新方案，主张实施朝鲜北部和朝鲜南部的朝鲜联邦制，作为解决朝鲜和平统一问题的过渡办法。这个方案获得了全世界人民的赞扬和支持，也获得南北朝鲜人民的热烈拥护。美国如果真正像它自己所说的那样，“愿意”实现朝鲜的统一，有什么理由拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的建议呢？美帝国主义破坏朝鲜实现统一，企图永远霸占南朝鲜的阴谋，绝不是它所操纵的“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”在联合国大会中颠倒黑白的什么“报告”所能掩盖得了的。
    中国人民一向认为，朝鲜问题只能由朝鲜人民自己解决。作为交战一方的联合国，在美国的操纵和排斥朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加的情况下讨论“朝鲜问题”，是完全非法的，因而它所作出的任何决议都是无效的。为了朝鲜问题的和平解决，美国必须停止利用联合国的名义对朝鲜进行干涉，美国侵略军必须立即全部从南朝鲜撤出去。
