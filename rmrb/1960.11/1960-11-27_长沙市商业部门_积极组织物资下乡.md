Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 26th: The commercial departments of Changsha City, Hunan Province, are actively organizing the supply of goods to rural areas to support agricultural production and meet the needs of commune members. Since the third quarter of this year, the total value of coal, diesel fuel, drill bits, sledgehammers, machine-made paper, light bulbs, rubber shoes, soap, thermos bottles, and other means of production and daily necessities transferred to rural areas has increased by 7.27% compared to the same period last year.

Since the beginning of this year, Changsha's commercial departments have sent more than 20 batches of cadres deep into rural areas to understand the needs. In arranging production, organizing processing, and transferring supplies, the commercial departments, adhering to the principle of prioritizing the needs of rural areas, promptly delivered goods to the countryside. The fourth quarter's soap distribution plan is currently 87% complete. Daily necessities needed by commune members, such as hairpins, bakelite buttons, snap fasteners, wooden combs, and steel needles, have also been promptly transferred to rural areas. The processing and purchasing departments of the Changsha Industrial Equipment Company, in addition to prioritizing the processing and production of crushers, fodder choppers, and grass cutters needed by rural people's communes, also guarantee priority transport. When their own vehicles are insufficient, they borrow from other units and use the gaps in car and boat schedules to bring goods to the countryside.

While supplying rural production materials, the commercial departments also adopt preferential measures of "guaranteed use, guaranteed teaching, and guaranteed repair," closely integrating supply, repair, and use. The daily-use industrial product repair workshop of the department store retail company dispatched a repair team, carrying tools and materials, to 19 production brigades in the Pingtang and Wangyue communes of Changsha County, providing mobile repair services for gas lamps, sprayers, rubber shoes, glasses, cultural and sports goods, etc., which were very popular among commune members.

    长沙市商业部门
    积极组织物资下乡
    新华社长沙二十六日电　湖南长沙市商业部门积极组织物资下乡，支援农业生产和供应社员生活需要。今年第三季度以来，先后调到农村的煤炭、柴油、炮钎、鎯头、机制纸、灯泡、胶鞋、肥皂、暖水瓶等生产资料和生活资料，总额比去年同期增长了百分之七点二七。
    今年以来，长沙市商业部门先后派出二十多批干部深入农村，了解需要。在安排生产、组织加工、调运供应等方面，商业部门本着优先满足农村需要的原则，及时把商品调到农村。第四季度的肥皂下放计划，目前已经完成百分之八十七。社员需要的发夹、胶木平扣、按扣、木梳、钢针等日用小商品，也及时调到农村。长沙工业器材公司的加工采购部门，除优先安排农村人民公社所需要的破碎机、饲料切碎机、切草机等机具的加工生产以外，还保证优先调运。自己的汽车不够用，就向其他单位借用，并利用车、船空隙，带货下乡。
    在供应农村生产资料同时，商业部门还采取包用、包教、包修的优待办法，使供应、修理、使用三者紧密结合起来。百货零售公司日用工业品修补车间派出了修补队，带着工具、材料，下到长沙县的坪塘、望岳等公社的十九个生产大队，巡回修理汽灯、喷雾器、胶鞋、眼镜、文娱体育用品等，很受社员欢迎。
