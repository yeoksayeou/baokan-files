Displaying the Perseverance to Cut Through Thorns and Thistles, Opening Up Large Tracts of Fertile Farmland
State-Owned Farm Workers Create Grain Base

(Reported by this newspaper) The employees of nineteen state-owned farms in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province have been cutting through thorns and thistles, fighting hard, and developing a rich, beautiful, and fertile land on the frontier. In the past few years, they have planted rice, corn, sweet potatoes, coffee, bananas, pineapples, and many tropical and subtropical cash crops on more than 280,000 mu of barren land. In production, the farm workers have formed a close friendship with farmers of various ethnic minorities and helped farmers of all ethnic groups promote advanced farming systems and production technologies.

Xishuangbanna is one of China's few tropical and subtropical regions. In order to accelerate the development of Xishuangbanna's abundant resources, the Party and the state decided to establish state-owned farms on a large scale here and develop grain crops and tropical and subtropical cash crops. In 1953, a group of farm workers came to Xishuangbanna and established the first state-owned farm—Liming Farm—in Mengzhe Dam, the largest dam in the entire state. Later, many young people who were determined to take root and bear fruit in the border areas came to Xishuangbanna one after another. Over the past seven years, nineteen state-owned farms have been established. These farm pioneers cut down thorny bushes, black heart trees, and large tropical bamboo clumps on the edge of the primitive forest and in the uninhabited wilderness, and then reclaimed the land with hoes, one after another. Because the land had been barren for a long time, the soil was very hard. Some employees of Guanglong Farm sharpened their hoes down to only a small piece after digging for a month. In the reclamation process, people overcame many difficulties, which accelerated the pace of reclamation year by year. This year, the area of ​​paddy fields on the farm has expanded more than two times compared with 1958, and the area of ​​dry land has increased two and a half times, of which the area of ​​cotton, sugar cane, and peanuts has expanded one to five times. At present, the farms in the state have reclaimed a total of more than 280,000 mu of land, which is equivalent to 40% of the land reclaimed by farmers of all ethnic groups in the state in the past ten years. At present, state-owned farms in the state have 230 standard units of tractors, which provides important material conditions for expanding the cultivated area in the future.

These wastelands were originally places where wild animals haunted. The employees of the state-owned farms had to cultivate these wastelands and fight wild animals at the same time, driving them away or eliminating them. People seized farmland from wild animals. The desolate mountains and plains where wild animals used to roam in groups are now covered with golden late rice and corn, and bunches of bananas are bending the branches. Now is the season for harvesting late rice, and news of bumper harvests is coming from everywhere. The area of ​​grain crops in Jinghong State-Owned Farm this year has increased twenty times compared with last year, and the total output has also increased significantly.

In the process of developing the border areas, the employees of the state-owned farms and the people of various ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna, such as Dai, Hani, and Bulang, have formed close comrades-in-arms, and they have helped the people of various ethnic groups promote advanced farming systems and production technologies. In the past, Dai farmers only planted one season of late rice and did not plant early rice. This year, agricultural production cooperatives in Mangguanglong, Manmai, Manjingdai, and Manguanghua in Jinghong County have decided to plant double-season rice. For this reason, the irrigation problem must be solved first. These agricultural cooperatives decided to jointly build a 9-kilometer-long canal to introduce the water from the Liusha River into the fields, but they lacked labor. After Guanglong Farm learned about this, it immediately sent 56 employees to dig and repair with the Dai commune members. It took more than a month to complete the canal, ensuring that more than 500 mu of land was changed from one season to two seasons, and the average yield per mu increased by 40% compared with last year. The new agricultural tools and agricultural machinery cultivation of the farm also left a deep impression on the ethnic minorities in the border areas. When the Jila State-Owned Farm used tractors to plow the fields for the Dai agricultural cooperatives, farmers of the nearby Dai, Yao, Bulang, and Hani ethnic groups all ran to watch. After watching, they were very moved and saw the bright future of the border area more clearly, which encouraged their enthusiasm for production. When the farm is in trouble, the ethnic minorities also come to support it. This year, Guanglong Farm transformed four mu of muddy land into paddy fields. Because the area was too small, the tractor could not turn around. The Manguanghua Agricultural Cooperative took the initiative to send seven people and seven cattle to support the farm in exchange for equal value, helping the farm cultivate this piece of land. People affectionately call this piece of land a friendship field.

    发挥披荆斩棘的毅力　开辟大片肥沃的良田
    国营农场职工创建粮食基地
    本报讯　云南省西双版纳傣族自治州十九个国营农场的职工披荆斩棘，艰苦奋战，在边疆开发出一片富饶、美丽、肥沃的土地。几年来，他们在二十八万多亩荒芜的田地里种出了水稻、玉米、红薯、咖啡、香蕉、菠萝和许多热带和亚热带的经济作物；生产中，农场的职工和少数民族农民结成了亲密的友谊，并帮助各族农民推广先进的耕作制度和生产技术。
    西双版纳是我国有数的热带和亚热带地区之一，为了加速开发西双版纳丰厚的资源，党和国家决定在这里大办国营农场，发展粮食作物和热带、亚热带的经济作物。1953年，一批农场职工来到了西双版纳，在全州最大的勐遮坝建立了第一个国营农场——黎明农场。以后，又有许多立志在边疆生根、结果的青年人陆续来到西双版纳。七年来，已经有十九个国营农场建立起来。这些农场的垦荒者在原始森林边缘和渺无人烟的荒原中，刈除刺蓬、黑心树和热带的大竹蓬，然后一锄一锄地垦荒。由于荒芜的年代长了，土质非常坚硬，广龙农场有的职工，一把锄头挖一个月就磨得只剩一小块了。开荒中，人们克服了许多困难，使开荒的速度一年比一年加快。今年，农场的水田面积比1958年扩大了两倍多，旱地的面积增加了两倍半，其中棉花、甘蔗、花生的面积都扩大了一至五倍。现在，全州农场一共开荒二十八万多亩，等于全州各族农民十年来开荒面积的40％，目前全州国营农场已拥有拖拉机二百三十个标准台，为今后扩大耕地面积提供了重要的物质条件。
    这些荒地原来都是野兽出没的地方，国营农场的职工一面要在这些荒地上耕作，一面还要和野兽搏斗，把它们赶走或者消灭掉。人们从野兽那里夺来了田地。往日野兽成群的荒凉的山峦和平原，眼下已铺满了金黄的晚稻和玉米，一串串的香蕉压弯了枝头。现在正是收割晚稻的季节，到处都在传来丰收的消息。国营景洪农场今年粮食作物面积比去年增加了二十倍，总产量也有大幅度的增长。
    在开发边疆的过程中，国营农场的职工和西双版纳的傣、哈尼、布朗等各族人民结成了亲密的战友，他们帮助各族人民推行先进的耕作制度和生产技术。傣族农民以往只种一季晚稻，不种早稻。今年，景洪县的曼广龙、曼卖、曼京傣、曼光化等农业生产合作社都决定种双季稻，为此，必须首先解决灌溉问题。这些农业社决定联合修建一条九公里长的水渠，把流沙河水引进田里，但是缺少劳动力。广龙农场知道后，立即派出了五十六个职工和傣族社员一起挖修，用一个多月时间便把水渠修成了，保证了五百多亩田由一季改成两季，平均单产比去年增加了40％。农场的新式农具和农业机械耕作也给边疆的少数民族留下了深刻的印象，国营季腊农场用拖拉机给傣族的农业社翻田时，附近的傣族、瑶族、布朗族和哈尼族农民都跑去看，看过后，非常感动，更清楚地看到了边疆的光明前途，鼓舞了生产积极性。当农场有困难的时候，少数民族也来支援。今年，广龙农场把四亩烂泥塘改造成水田，因为面积太少，拖拉机转不过来，曼光化农业社以等价交换的办法主动地派七个人七条牛来支援，帮助农场把这块田耕出来，人们亲密地把这片田称为友谊田。
