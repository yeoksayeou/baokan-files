Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 15th: The two nationally famous giant blast furnaces – Anshan Iron and Steel No. 10 Blast Furnace and Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace – recently sent representatives to the Anshan Iron and Steel Smelting Plant to sign a friendship competition contract. In the contract, the workers of the two blast furnaces unanimously stated that in the last month or so of this year, through mutual learning, mutual assistance, and learning from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses, they will push the production level of both sides to a new peak, so that various production indicators can be completed even more outstandingly.

The contract, in addition to specifically stipulating the leap forward indicators for blast furnace utilization coefficient, coke ratio, and pig iron qualified rate that both parties must achieve in November and December, also clearly stipulates: Exchange information every five days, exchange information on the realization of production indicators of both parties, and exchange newly emerging technical reforms and advanced operating experience at any time.

There is a special reason for these two blast furnaces to carry out a competition. Anshan Iron and Steel No. 10 Blast Furnace was built and put into production in November 1958, and Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace was built and put into production in July 1959. The volumes of the two blast furnaces are similar, and they are currently the largest blast furnaces in our country. Wang Hongshun, the furnace chief of Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace, and Jie Benhuan, the furnace chief of Anshan Iron and Steel No. 10 Blast Furnace, are old comrades-in-arms. Two years ago, both of them served as duty furnace chiefs in Anshan Iron and Steel No. 7 Blast Furnace, one in Class A and the other in Class B.

On the morning of November 9, Wang Hongshun, the furnace chief of Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace, led a group of four people to the Anshan Iron and Steel Smelting Plant and went straight to No. 10 Blast Furnace. When the workers of No. 10 Blast Furnace heard that Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace had sent representatives to sign a friendship competition contract with them, they posted large-character slogans such as "Warmly Welcome Representatives of Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace" and "Humbly Learn Advanced Experience from Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace" the night before. While signing the contract, both parties, in the spirit of mutual learning and mutual assistance, earnestly exchanged their respective situations and experiences. In addition to learning from No. 10 Blast Furnace's experience in increasing smelting intensity and producing more iron, Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace also learned advanced operating experience from No. 10 Blast Furnace in ensuring smooth furnace conditions. The representatives of Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace also unreservedly introduced to the workers of No. 10 Blast Furnace their successful experience in preventing air leakage, gas leakage, and water leakage in the blast furnace, and also introduced the advanced experience of replacing the "distributor seal" on the top of the furnace without stopping the blast. The representatives of No. 10 Blast Furnace stated that they would send people to Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace to study on the spot in the near future.

After signing the friendship competition contract with Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace, the workers of No. 10 Blast Furnace also held a rally of all the furnace workers, determined to realize the various competition conditions stipulated in the contract.

    两座“高炉王”开展友谊赛
    鞍钢十高炉和武钢二高炉互学互帮力争多产铁
    据新华社鞍山15日电　全国著名的两座巨型高炉——鞍钢十号高炉和武钢二号高炉，最近派代表在鞍钢炼铁厂签订了友谊竞赛合同。两座高炉的职工在合同中一致表示，在今年最后的一个多月中，通过互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短，把双方生产水平推向一个新的高峰，使各项生产指标完成得更加出色。
    合同中除了具体规定双方11月份和12月份要达到的高炉利用系数、焦比、生铁合格率等跃进指标以外，还明确地规定：每隔五天通一次情报，交换双方生产指标实现情况，并且随时交换新出现的技术改革和先进操作经验。
    这两座高炉开展对手赛，有着特殊的缘由。鞍钢十号高炉是1958年11月建成投入生产的，武钢二号高炉是1959年7月建成投入生产的，两座高炉的容积相仿，都是我国当前最大的高炉；武钢二号高炉炉长王洪顺和鞍钢十号高炉炉长解本环是老战友，两年以前两人都在鞍钢七号高炉担任值班炉长，一个在甲班，一个在乙班。
    11月9日清晨，武钢二号高炉炉长王洪顺带领的一行四人来到鞍钢炼铁厂之后，直奔十号高炉。十号高炉职工听说武钢二号高炉派代表来同他们签订友谊竞赛合同，头天晚上就贴出了“热烈欢迎武钢二号高炉代表”、“虚心向武钢二号高炉学习先进经验”的大字标语。在这次签订合同的同时，双方都本着互相学习互相帮助的精神，认真地交流了各自的情况和经验。武钢二号高炉除学习了十号高炉提高冶炼强度多炼铁的经验以外，还学到了十号高炉保证炉况顺利等方面的先进操作经验。武钢二号高炉代表也毫无保留地向十号高炉职工介绍了他们在高炉上防止漏风、漏煤气、漏水的成功经验，并且介绍了不休风更换炉顶“布料器密封”的先进经验。十号高炉代表表示要在不久派人到武钢二号高炉去实地学习。
    十号高炉职工在同武钢二号高炉签订开展友谊竞赛合同以后，还举行了全炉职工誓师大会，决心实现合同中规定的各种竞赛条件。
