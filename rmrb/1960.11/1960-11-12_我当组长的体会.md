    My Experiences as a Group Leader
    Sun Fagong, Leader of the Class A Group of the 0.5-Ton Converter Team, Qingdao Bicycle Factory

    I am the group leader of Class A of the 0.5-ton converter team at the Qingdao Bicycle Factory. Our group has a total of sixteen people, including two Party members and three Youth League members, all of whom are new workers who joined the factory in 1958. Over the past two years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, we have transformed from workers who did not understand steelmaking production into steelmaking workers with a certain level of technical skill. Since March of this year, we have overfulfilled the state plan every ten days and every month, with a qualification rate of 100%.

    I started serving as the group leader in June of this year. Now, I will share a few of my experiences as a group leader.

    To Do a Good Job in Group Production, We Must First Do a Good Job in Ideological Work

    The Party often teaches me that to do a good job in group production, we must first do a good job in ideological work, so that the entire group is of one mind and one heart. To do a good job in the ideological work of the entire group, I must first put politics in command myself in order to help others raise their awareness.

    Together with the Party and Youth League members and activists in the group, I often analyze the ideological situation of the entire group and resolve ideological problems. For example, in July of this year, production was not rising. We organized a special debate and had everyone discuss: "Why is our group's production not rising? Why is our production not as good as Class C's with the same raw materials?" After group discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that: due to the existence of complacency, not humbly learning from Class C, and not actively trying to overcome difficulties, production was not rising. Based on the unified understanding, the comrades unanimously expressed: "We must boost our energy, strive for advancement, and catch up with and surpass Class C in July, and vow to win the title of converter pacesetter team." As a result, this oath was realized, we caught up with Class C, and were rated as the converter's pacesetter team.

    For the ideological problems of individuals in the group, we adopt the method of "one key opens one lock," through individual talks, visits, casual chats, and making friends, to help solve ideological problems on the one hand, and to care for them in production and life on the other, to solve their specific difficulties and concentrate their energy on production. For example, recorder An Yuke is a high school graduate. In the past, he thought that "steelmaking has no future" and did not work hard. Originally, the recorder's job was very light, and in principle he should take time to help drag steel ingots. Once, I asked him to drag them, but he refused and complained to me: "Doing this temporary job, and still have to manage those things." I saw that it was dangerous for him to develop like this and that he had to be transformed. At that time, I thought of the scene where the branch secretary patiently educated me time and time again, and I was determined to help him as the Party helped me. I took the initiative to approach him, eat with him, play with him, and watch movies with him, slowly understanding his ideological situation, and using my own ideological transformation to enlighten him. When I first came to the factory in 1958, I also thought that I was a junior high school graduate and should find a "promising" job. Who knew that the leadership assigned me to steelmaking. At that time, I was very disappointed, and I didn't perform well at work, loafing around and not attending meetings. I once asked to change to a technical job. After the secretary knew what was on my mind, he patiently patted me on the shoulder and said: "Little Sun, any job will have a future as long as you do it well. The work that the Party needs is the most promising work. You are a young man, a successor to socialism, and you should look at the past. Our country had no steel, and we had to rely on foreign countries for everything, so we were always bullied by imperialism. To completely turn over and change the 'poor and blank' face, we must develop the steel industry." Then, the secretary enlightened me on the idea that I thought there was no technology to learn in steelmaking, saying: "You are a junior high school graduate, and you have learned a lot. Tell me, how do you look at the fire color when tapping the steel, and how do you know when the blowing is done?" At that time, I was really stumped. I really didn't know the answer to this question, so I slowly realized that: the little book knowledge I had learned was not enough, and the problems in steelmaking production had to be learned from scratch. The secretary also said: "Without advanced thinking, you can't learn technology. It is difficult to do a good job without loving it." The secretary's words hit the nail on the head, making me realize that a young person should correctly treat his personal future. The Party proposed: "Take steel as the key link and make an all-round leap forward." Since steel production is so important, why is it not promising? I secretly made up my mind: I must work on the steel front for the rest of my life. My ideological problem was solved, and I was energetic at work. An Yuke was greatly inspired after hearing about my transformation. He said to me: "Old Sun, you used to be a student, and so am I. If you can transform, so can I." An Yuke's ideological problem was solved, and he was full of energy at work. He dragged more steel ingots than anyone else in the group, and dragged them well. He often reflected the ideological situation of the comrades in the group to me, and he was also eager to make progress and strive to join the Youth League. In my daily work, I also paid attention to giving play to his enthusiasm. Because he did a very good job, the organization let him be the group's dispatcher and chairman of the trade union group. We cooperated very well in our work, and we discussed things together. Now An Yuke has become the most outstanding dispatcher in the four converter shifts.

    In addition to individually helping comrades, I also relied on Party members, Youth League members, and activists to do work. For the few young people in the class who were making slow progress, I divided the work and assigned responsibilities based on their individual characteristics and provided specific assistance.

    Only by Working Hard to Improve Technology Can We Do a Good Job in Production

    To do a good job in production, in addition to doing a good job in ideological work, we must also master technology. Without technology, we cannot discover problems in time and solve the key to production. To enable all comrades in the group to learn technology well, I must first learn technology well myself. In order to improve my technical level, I get up early and go to bed late every day, watching others operate in the workshop. In order to combine theoretical knowledge with practical operation, in addition to worshiping seven masters in the workshop and asking for advice at any time, I also used my spare time to study steelmaking theory books. Sometimes, in order to solve a specific problem, I read until late at night. At the same time, I also often went to fraternal units to learn advanced experience. For more than a year, I and my comrades have gone to six fraternal factories, including the Vehicle Factory, Sansteel, Ersteel, and State Cotton Factory No. 6, to learn experience more than 100 times, especially the Vehicle Factory, which I went to almost every day. Once, when I passed by the Vehicle Factory, I couldn't help but run in when I saw them blowing steel. I watched them make one furnace after another, watching several furnaces in a row. As a result, the movie tickets in my pocket also expired.

    While paying attention to learning technology and improving my skills, I patiently taught what I learned to others and helped all comrades in the group improve their technical level. Especially with the development of the steel industry, a large number of skilled steel workers were transferred to support newly built units. Our group originally had 26 people, but now there are only 16. Faced with the shortage of labor, we launched a multi-skilled activity starting in June of this year, requiring everyone to learn several technologies. The main method of learning is: under the condition of not affecting production, adopt methods such as rotation, exchange of processes, and technical performance competitions, and constantly improve in actual production. In just over three months, the workers in the group generally mastered more than two technologies, and some people were able to master more than ten technologies, and seven people reached "one top two and a half." This not only improved the technical level, but also solved the key to the shortage of labor.

    Strengthen Small Group Production Management

    While improving technology, we also paid attention to strengthening the management of the small group. According to the instructions of the Party branch, after implementing the four-eight cross-operation, we must strengthen the pre-shift and post-shift meetings to ensure that the production order is normal and orderly. In order to hold the pre-shift meeting well, I always arrive at the workshop in advance to understand the production situation of the previous shift, explain the production tasks of the current shift to the comrades, put forward specific keys and measures, and check the wearing of protective equipment to prevent accidents. The post-shift meeting mainly checks and discusses the production situation of the current shift, so that problems of the current shift are solved in the current shift, and experiences and lessons are summarized and exchanged in a timely manner. Good people and good deeds are evaluated and commended in the current shift, and shortcomings are helped by everyone. For example, once Sun Naiyi did not attend the pre-shift meeting. There was a small crack in the "tap hole" of the previous shift. Originally, plugging it with mud could have avoided the occurrence of an accident. As a result, he did not understand this situation, and 150 kilograms of molten steel ran off. We conducted a special study of this issue at the post-shift meeting and used it as a lesson. Since then, there has been no phenomenon of not attending the meeting.

    In addition to this, our group also closely focused on high-quality and high-yield to carry out production key ranking. We found ways to solve the keys that were ranked to ensure continuous improvement in production. A total of seventeen keys were identified in the third quarter, the most prominent of which was: the converter could not keep up with the production of the melting furnace, mainly because the crane could not keep up with the production needs of the two furnaces. We adopted the method of cross-operation of the crane in front of the furnace, and the problem was solved. In addition, converter blowing is also a key, which affects the quality of the steel. We went to the State Cotton Factory No. 6 to learn their full-course surface blowing method, which worked very well and ensured the blowing of high-quality steel.

    Since July, we have promoted the team economic accounting, so that everyone in the high-quality and high-yield competition not only pays attention to producing more high-quality steel, but also cares about how to reduce costs. Because each shift analyzes the production situation in a timely manner and announces the cost profit and loss of the group, the workers slowly learn to keep accounts, and they will calculate whether the shift has a surplus or a loss for how much high-quality steel is produced in each shift. In order to produce more high-quality steel, the comrades in the whole group tried every means to improve quality and save raw materials. Since July, our group has picked an average of 350 kilograms of scrap iron and scrap steel every day.

    Carry Forward the Communist Spirit of Cooperation

    The Party often teaches us that: the purpose of competition is to "help each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and improve together." Especially since our steelmaking production is a continuous operation, to maintain the converter's red flag, the production of each shift must be able to leap forward. In my daily work, I first use my personal actions to drive everyone, requiring all comrades in the group to "leave the difficulties to themselves and send the convenience to others." Our group put forward the slogan of action: "Competition is a race against time, and cooperation does not distinguish between you and me." In production, we conscientiously implemented the "six not go, three satisfaction" handover system. The six not go are: tools are not prepared, do not go; hygiene is not good, do not go; steel ingots are not stacked, do not go; ingot molds are not installed in two and a half sets, do not go; auxiliary materials are not enough for one shift, do not go; the receiving shift is not satisfied, do not go. Thus, to achieve three satisfaction, namely: the handover shift is satisfied, the receiving shift is satisfied, and everyone is satisfied.

    The achievements we have made should be attributed to the Party, and the work we have done is still far from the requirements of the Party. We are determined to continue to work hard, continue to improve, and continue to move forward.

    我当组长的体会
    青岛自行车厂零点五吨转炉组甲班组长　孙发功
    我是自行车厂零点五吨转炉组甲班组长。我们组共有十六人，其中党员二人，团员三人，全部是1958年进厂的新工人。两年来，在党的培养教育下，我们已由不懂炼钢生产变为具有一定技术水平的炼钢工人。今年3月以来，旬旬月月超额完成国家计划，合格率达到100％。
    我从今年6月份开始担任组长，现在谈谈我当组长的几点体会。
    要搞好小组生产，首先要做好思想工作
    党经常教导我，要搞好小组生产，首先要做好思想工作，使全组一条心，一股劲。要做好全组的思想工作，必须自己首先政治挂帅，才能帮助别人提高觉悟。
    我同组里的党、团员和积极分子，经常分析全组思想情况，解决思想问题。如今年7月份生产跃不上去，我们组织了专题辩论，让大家讨论：“为什么我们组的生产跃不上去？同样的原料为什么我们生产不如丙班？”经过小组讨论，大家一致认为：由于存在自满情绪，不虚心向丙班学习，不主动想办法克服困难，因而生产上不去。在统一思想的基础上，同志们一致表示：“要鼓干劲，争上游，在7月内一定要赶上丙班，超过丙班，誓夺转炉标兵班”。结果，这个誓言实现了，赶上了丙班，并被评为转炉的标兵班。
    对组里个别人的思想问题，我们采取“一把钥匙开一把锁”的办法，通过个别谈心、走访、啦家常、交朋友等办法，一面帮助解决思想问题，一面从生产上、生活上关心他们，为他们解决具体困难，使他们的精力集中到生产上来。如记录员安玉可是高中毕业生，过去，认为“炼钢没出息”，工作不起劲。本来记录员的活很轻，按理应该抽空帮助拖钢锭。有一次我叫他拖，他不拖，反向我发牢骚：“干这个临时工，还管那些事。”我看到他这样发展下去很危险，不转变不行。当时，我联想到支部书记三番五次耐心教育我的情形，就下决心要像党帮助我一样去帮助他。我主动地和他接近，和他在一块吃、一块玩、一块看电影，慢慢地了解他的思想情况，用我的思想转变来启发他。我在1958年刚来厂时，也认为自己是一个初中毕业生，应该找一个“有出息”的工作，谁知领导分配我炼钢。当时，我很失望，在工作中表现不好，干起活来游游逛逛，开会也不参加。我曾经要求换个有技术的活干。书记知道我的心事后，耐心地拍着我的肩膀说：“小孙，无论什么工作只要好好干就会有出息。党需要的工作就是最有出息的工作。你是个青年，是社会主义的接班人，应该看看过去，我们国家没有钢铁，什么都得靠着外国，因此总是受帝国主义的欺负；要彻底翻身改变‘一穷二白’的面貌，就得发展钢铁工业。”接着书记针对我认为炼钢没有技术可学的思想进行启发说：“你是一个初中毕业生，学的东西可不少，你说说，出钢时的火色怎么看法，怎么样算是吹炼好了？”当时可把我问住了，这个问题我真不知道，于是我慢慢地认识到：仅仅学到的一点书本知识是不够用的，炼钢生产中的问题还得从头学起。书记又说：“没有先进的思想，就学不会技术，不热爱工作就很难搞好工作。”书记的一字一句都打中了我的要害，使我认识到了一个青年人应该正确对待个人的前途。党提出：“以钢为纲，全面跃进”，既然钢铁生产这样重要，为什么还没出息？我便暗暗下定决心：一定要在钢铁战线上干一辈子。我的思想问题解决了，工作也有劲了。安玉可听了我的转变，受到很大启发。他对我说：“老孙，你过去也是学生，我也是学生，你能转变我也能转变。”安玉可的思想问题解决了，工作劲头也足了。组里拖钢锭数他拖得多拖得好。他经常向我反映组里同志们的思想情况，自己也迫切要求进步争取入团。在平日工作中，我也注意发挥他的积极性，由于他干得很好，组织上又让他当组里的调度员兼工会组长。在工作中我们俩配合很好，有事一块商量，现在安玉可已成为转炉四个班中最优秀的调度员了。
    我除了个别帮助同志以外，还依靠党团员和积极分子做工作，对班里几个进步慢的青年，针对各个人的特点，分工包干，进行具体帮助。
    只有努力提高技术，才能搞好生产
    要搞好生产，除了做好思想工作外，还必须掌握技术，没有技术就不能及时发现问题，解决生产关键。要使全组的同志都学好技术，首先必须自己学好技术。为了提高自己的技术水平，我每天都是早起晚睡，在车间观看别人操作。为了使理论知识和实际操作相结合，我除了在车间拜了七个师傅随时请教外，并利用业余时间学习炼钢理论书籍，有时为了解决一个具体问题，看书看到深夜。同时，我还经常到兄弟单位学习先进经验。一年多以来，我和同志们曾到车辆厂、三钢、二钢、国棉六厂等六个兄弟厂学习经验一百多次，特别是车辆厂几乎每天都去。有一次我路过车辆厂时，一看见他们正在吹炼，不由自主地就跑去了，看他们炼完一炉又一炉，一连看了好几炉。结果，口袋里装的电影票也过时间了。
    我一面自己注意学习技术，提高本领，一面把我学到的东西耐心地教给别人，帮助全组同志提高技术水平。特别是随着钢铁工业的发展，一些熟练的钢铁工人大批调出去支援新建单位，我们组原来二十六人，现在只有十六人了。面对着劳力不足的情况，我们从今年6月份起，开展了多面手活动，要求每一个人学会几项技术。学习的主要方法是：在不影响生产的情况下，采取轮流作业、互换工序和技术表演赛等方法，在实际生产中不断得到提高，仅三个多月的时间，全组工人普遍能掌握两种以上技术，有的人还能掌握十多种技术，并有七人达到“一顶两个半”。这样不仅提高了技术水平，同时解决了劳动力不足的关键。
    加强小组生产管理
    在提高技术的同时，我们还注意了加强小组的管理工作。根据党支部的指示，在实行四八交叉作业后，一定要加强班前班后会，保证生产秩序正常不紊。为了开好班前会，我都提前到车间，了解上班生产情况，向同志们交代当班生产任务，提出具体关键和措施，并检查防护用品穿戴情况，防止发生事故。班后会主要检查和讨论当班生产情况，使当班问题当班解决，有了经验教训，及时总结交流，发现了好人好事当班评比表扬，有缺点大家帮助。如有一次孙乃义没有开班前会，上一班的“铸口”有个小裂口，本来用泥塞住就能避免事故的发生，结果他不了解这一情况，跑了钢水一百五十多公斤。我们便在班后会上把这一问题作了专门研究，并以此作为教训。从此以后再也没有不参加会的现象了。
    除此以外，我们小组还紧紧围绕优质高产进行生产关键排队。排出关键就想法解决，保证生产不断提高。第三季度内共找出了十七项关键，其中最突出的关键问题是：转炉跟不上化铁炉的生产，主要是吊车跟不上两个炉生产的需要，我们便采取吊车炉前交叉作业的办法，问题就解决了。另外，转炉吹炼也是一个关键，影响炼好钢，我们就到国棉六厂去学习他们全程面吹的办法，效果很好，保证了吹炼优质钢。
    7月份以来，我们推广了班组经济核算，使每一个人在优质高产竞赛中，既注意多出优质钢，又能关心如何降低成本。由于每班及时分析生产情况和公布小组的成本盈亏情况，慢慢地工人都学会了算账，对每班生产了多少优质钢，自己就会算出当班有盈余，还是亏损。全组同志为了多出优质钢，千方百计想办法提高质量，节约原材料。自7月份以来，我们组每天平均拣废铁废钢三百五十公斤。
    发扬共产主义协作精神
    党经常教导我们：竞赛的目的是为了“互相帮助，互相学习，取长补短，共同提高”。特别是我们炼钢生产是连续作业，要保住转炉的红旗，必须要各个班的生产都能跃上去。在平日工作中，我首先以个人的行动来带动大家，要求全组同志“把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人”。我们组提出了：“竞赛分秒必争，协作不分你我”的行动口号。在生产中认真执行了“六不走、三满意”的交接班制度。六不走是：工具准备不齐不走；卫生清洁不好不走；钢锭不垛不走；锭模安不上两套半不走；辅助材料不够一班用的不走；接班的不满意不走。从而作到三满意，即：交班满意，接班满意，人人满意。
    我们所取得的成绩应该归功于党，我们所做的工作离党的要求还差的很远。我们决心继续努力，不断提高，不断前进。
