Xinhua News Agency report: The U.S. imperialists' escalating preparations for an armed invasion of Cuba have ignited a wave of support for the Cuban people in Latin America. Public opinion in many Latin American countries points out that aggression against Cuba is aggression against all of Latin America. They express their determination to stand with the Cuban people and fight to smash the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy of aggression.

Mexican People's Socialist Party General Secretary Lombardo Toledano spoke to the press about the U.S. imperialists' preparations to launch an armed attack on Cuba, saying that the U.S. plan to invade Cuba is ready. He emphasized that if an armed invasion of Cuba is launched, the people will attack the U.S. government's aggressive policy and condemn the Guatemalan government.

The well-known Mexican social activist and Vice-President of the World Peace Council, Heriberto Jara, said in an interview with TASS that any delay sought by the United States in the United Nations in discussing the Cuban issue represents not only a serious threat to this nation fighting to defend its independence, but also a serious threat to world peace.

Jara said that any attempt to invade the Republic of Cuba, to force imperialist demands on the country, and to restrict the freedom of its people, would be a dangerous precedent for all Latin American countries and all small countries fighting to free themselves from colonialism. Jara said that all freedom-loving people should therefore regard the cause of Cuba as their own and fight back against the imperialist plans.

The Chilean "National Movement for Support and Defense of the Cuban Revolution" issued a public statement on the evening of October 30, stating that "no matter what sudden events occur, Chile will once again affirm its support for Cuba."

The statement said that the Chilean people and democratic strata who have expressed enthusiastic support for the Cuban Revolution will reaffirm this support and resolutely oppose the provocations and aggression of U.S. imperialism, because the welfare won by the Cuban people with heroism and dignity represents the most ardent aspirations of the Chilean people.

In the most populous municipality of Santiago Province, Quinta Normal, a mass meeting was held on the 29th in the City Council Hall. The meeting decided to broadly support the Cuban Revolution. All city councilors of the city and the masses who attended the meeting decided to write a letter to the Cuban Ambassador to Chile, expressing the residents' support for the Cuban Revolution. Quinta Normal, with a population of 200,000, stated in the resolution of the meeting that if Cuba is subjected to armed aggression from imperialism, it will mobilize to support Cuba.

Brazilian workers and students held demonstrations and rallies in downtown Rio de Janeiro on the afternoon of the 4th to support the Cuban Revolution. The demonstrators held a rally. Speakers at the rally unanimously condemned U.S. imperialism and emphasized that the path of the Cuban Revolution is an example for the people of all Latin American countries. Students also performed a play about the Cuban Revolution written by a young Brazilian playwright, which exposed U.S. interference in Cuba and the conspiracy to further invade Cuba. The actors shouted in unison, "It is impossible to invade Cuba, because the people of all Latin American countries will defend the Cuban Revolution."

The National Student Union of Brazil announced that if the imperialists invade the Cuban people, it will recruit volunteers to go to Cuba to fight.

Brazilian Nationalist Parliamentary Front parliamentarian Coutinho Cavalcanti expressed support for the Cuban Revolution in a speech in the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, on the 1st. He said: Cuba's victory is also the victory of Brazil and all underdeveloped countries.

The Venezuelan Federation of University Students sent a telegram to Cuba on the 2nd, expressing firm support for Cuba's struggle against U.S. aggression.

The telegram said that in the name of Venezuelan students, we express our determination to fight against the imperialist aggression being prepared by the reactionary and bellicose ruling clique of the United States against the fraternal Cuban people. The Cuban Revolution will receive strong support from Venezuelan and Latin American students, and if Cuba resists, Latin America will be the second front against the imperialists.

The Bolivian "Fidel Castro Youth Committee" announced that its members have mobilized to defend the Cuban Revolution.

Groups of pickets from this organization distributed leaflets supporting the Cuban government and opposing U.S. imperialism to residents on the streets of the capital, La Paz, on October 31.

Ranivel Delgado Fiallo, president of the University Reform Front of Honduras, announced on October 31: "If Cuba is attacked by U.S. mercenaries, the Honduran people will oppose this aggression by taking actions against U.S. interests in Honduras." He pointed out that in the event of armed aggression, Honduran volunteers may be recruited to defend the Cuban Revolution. He said, "The Honduran people, like all Latin American people, sympathize with the Cuban Revolution, because Cuba hopes to become a country managed by itself."

The Nationalist Revolutionary Party and the Revolutionary Unity Party of Guatemala recently issued a joint statement condemning the Idígoras government, which is colluding with foreign countries and implementing anti-national and anti-democratic policies, for playing a despicable and shameless role in fabricating rumors that someone is preparing to invade Guatemala, in order to cover up its participation in the criminal preparations for the invasion of Cuba.
