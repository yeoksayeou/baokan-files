    Lost in Summer, Found in Autumn; Not Harvesting Wheat, Planting Rice
    Wangzhuangzi Production Team Increases Grain Production Through Perseverance

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Wangzhuangzi Production Team of Chengguan Commune, Jinghai County, Hebei Province, suffered two severe disasters last year, summer floods and autumn hail. However, under the leadership of the Party branch, all cadres and members, displaying the revolutionary spirit of hard work and practical effort, fought for a year and achieved a good harvest.

        Two Severe Disasters
    The Wangzhuangzi Production Team is a village of 245 households located at the southern end of Jia Kouwa, close to the west bank of the Heilonggang River. The terrain here is low-lying, prone to flooding nine years out of ten, and historically known as "Broken Wangzhuangzi." After liberation, through lowland transformation and water conservancy construction, grain production increased year by year, but it still did not completely escape the threat of natural disasters. Grain production was insufficient for self-sufficiency, and there were shortages every year.

    In the autumn of 1958, with the great leap forward in agricultural production and the birth of the People's Commune, the people of Wangzhuangzi were inspired with greater enthusiasm to overcome natural disasters. More than 2,600 mu of wheat sown in the autumn of that year were generally deep-plowed and sown in a timely manner. In the summer of 1959, the wheat seedlings grew chest-high. The members were all smiles when they saw the soon-to-be-harvested wheat. Just then—late at night on May 30th, an unfortunate event occurred. The northwest wind, carrying torrential rain, brought a fierce impact, and the surrounding embankment of Jia Kouwa breached. The raging flood engulfed the wheat fields, and even the 50 mu of rice seedling fields that had already been cultivated were destroyed.

    In the second half of that night, a Party branch meeting was held on the village's southern field yard, and a village-wide meeting of members was held again at dawn. After repeated discussions, everyone unanimously proposed: Do not succumb to difficulties, do not be intimidated by difficulties! Find in the east waht was lost in the west, find in the autumn what was lost in the summer, plant rice instead of wheat.

    It was already mid-May, and the early rice transplanting season had passed. The eastern lowlands were overgrown with weeds, waiting to be cultivated and prepared, and the seedlings had not yet been cultivated, and the fertilizer had not been prepared. But under the leadership of the Party branch, the farmers of Wangzhuangzi, regardless of gender, unafraid of wind and rain, moved from the western lowlands to the eastern lowlands, and finally rushed to transplant more than 1,200 mu of late rice. Although late rice is not as good as early rice, the rice still grew well due to the members' careful management. One night, the members were planning the harvesting of rice in the team department when suddenly a startling crash of thunder was heard, and torrential rain with hail poured down. By dawn the next day, the white hail all over the field had not yet melted, and little of the golden rice was left.

        Growing "Poor" Ambition
    A production team that was already very thin was hit by two devastating natural disasters in one year, with almost no harvest for the whole year. What a heavy blow! However, the disaster did not frighten them, but rather inspired them to work hard and completely change their poor face.

    Party Branch Secretary Tao Linghe said excitedly at a meeting of Party members and cadres after the disaster: "We must grow 'poor' ambitions, lead the masses to revolutionize 'poor' lives, and have a great harvest of grain next year to resolutely remove the poor hat." In order to strengthen everyone's confidence, the Party branch held a "United Hearts Meeting." At the meeting, the unanimous opinion of the people who had tasted the suffering of the old society was: Today, we have suffered a disaster, we have the leadership of the Party, we have the People's Commune as a backing, and we have the enthusiastic support of all walks of life. As long as everyone works together, we are fully confident of overcoming the famine and changing our face. How exactly do we change our face? The members discussed: "No one will steam馒头 for us or grind noodles for us. Running to the ends of the earth without working won't make us rich." "If we want to change from poor to rich, we have to grow crops well ourselves, there is no other way to go." The more they discussed, the clearer the direction, and the more they debated, the more motivated they became. The "United Hearts Meeting" made everyone united in heart. A high tide of salvaging the residual autumn, rushing to plant wheat, and carrying out production for self-relief quickly formed in the village.

    Uprooting the Roots of Poverty
    In February of this year, the county party committee held a four-level cadre meeting, which put forward the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link, both multiple planting and harvesting and high yield and multiple harvesting simultaneously, and also put forward the annual production increase target. The cadres of Wangzhuangzi actively responded to the call of the county party committee. They realized that in the current situation where natural disasters cannot be completely controlled, adhering to the principle of both multiple planting and harvesting and high yield and multiple harvesting simultaneously is the key to increasing grain production. They decided to expand the rice planting area, planting in the eastern lowlands and planting in the western lowlands, if the eastern lowlands do not harvest, the western lowlands will harvest, and a double lowland harvest will lead to great prosperity.

    After the meeting, they immediately returned to the village to convey this plan, and the vast number of cadres and masses actively supported and applauded it. However, some people with conservative ideas came out to speak: "Planting so much rice, not to mention transplanting, even cultivating seedlings will not be completed, it is better to plant less to ensure a harvest." Indeed, planting so much rice is really difficult. On average, each labor force in the village plants more than 30 mu of rice. At that time, large areas of rice fields did not have water conservancy projects, and the seedling ponds had not been prepared, and the time for cultivating seedlings and preparing the land was pressing. However, all of this did not shake their determination to expand the planting of rice in the slightest. On the one hand, the Party branch explained the favorable conditions to the vast number of cadres and masses, pointing out: In dry years, the water of Jia Kouwa can irrigate by gravity flow; in waterlogged years, there are drainage ditches and pumping stations that can drain water. On the other hand, they went deep into reality, summed up experience, and grasped planting reform. Deputy Secretary of the Branch Deng Liansui and Wang Bingyao, the captain of the Second Team, after surveying the terrain, found that the wheat fields that had been deep-plowed in 1958 all had a layer of mud after the water receded, and that direct sowing could produce good seedlings. They edged the ridges and sowed the seeds, greatly accelerating the speed of seedling cultivation. Originally, cultivating one point of seedlings took three workdays, but after the improvement, cultivating three points of seedlings only took one workday. For the main field project, they also adopted the method of following the high ground and following the low ground, building embankments and transplanting seedlings, and expanding the planting of marsh rice. This not only reduced the amount of work and saved labor, but also made the crops grow more adapted to the objective conditions.

        The Victory of the People
    In order to successfully overcome the rice transplanting hurdle, the Party branch made the following decision: Party members and cadres must stand at the forefront of production, and must use their hands and brains, and take the lead in everything. Party Branch Secretary Tao Linghe is a man in his fifties. When digging ditches, he always insisted on working and never took a break. When transplanting seedlings, he rushed to transport and transplant seedlings in the mud and water, inspecting and accepting. After work, when the members rested, he had to discuss work with the cadres and arrange production. The members said with concern: "Secretary! We'll do the work, you take a rest!" Production Team Leader Deng Changrun, while working in the Second Team, discovered that the transport of seedlings could not keep up with the transplanting because the pulling of seedlings did not have quotas and the work efficiency was low, so it could not keep up with the transport. After the universal implementation of labor quotas, the transplanting progress was greatly accelerated. In this battle, it was truly achieved: wherever there is a problem, there is a cadre; wherever there is a difficulty, there is a Party member taking the lead.

    The farmers of Wangzhuangzi boiled under the leadership of Party members and cadres. They concentrated all the labor that could be concentrated and determined to overcome the rice transplanting hurdle. At that time, the total number of labor and auxiliary labor mobilized in the village reached more than 410, accounting for 60% of the total population of the village. Auxiliary labor was responsible for pulling seedlings, strong labor was responsible for transporting seedlings, and general labor was responsible for transplanting seedlings. Adapting to the people and giving full play to their strengths; launching competitions to promote each other. The villagers fought for more than 50 days, rushing to plant more than 4,600 mu of rice, nearly three times the planting area in 1959.

    After the transplanting hurdle was overcome, the battle against waterlogging followed closely. Heavy rain submerged the rice seedlings in the low-lying areas, and the water of the Heilonggang River was also rising rapidly. How could the members not be anxious when they saw this scene! Under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, a battle to eliminate waterlogging began again. The rain was heavy and strong, and the water rose higher on the embankment. In two days, a new embankment was built. The accumulated water in the lowlands, after dredging the channels and stepping up pumping, was also quickly drained. The threat of waterlogging was once again conquered by the heroic people.

    The vast number of members are harvesting rice in a tense manner with joyful hearts. People holding high-stemmed, large-eared rice crops cannot help but say: "Vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production, listening to the Party is not wrong"!

### 夏季丢了秋季找　小麦不收种水稻  王庄子生产队百折不挠增产粮食

    夏季丢了秋季找　小麦不收种水稻
    王庄子生产队百折不挠增产粮食
    本报讯　河北静海县城关公社王庄子生产队，去年遭受了夏涝秋雹两次严重灾害，但是，在党支部的领导下，全体干部、社员发扬了苦干实干的革命精神，奋战一年，获得了很好的收成。
        两次严重灾害
    王庄子生产队，是位于贾口洼南端，紧靠黑龙港河西岸的一个二百四十五户的村庄。这里地势洼下，十年九涝，历史上被称为“破王庄子”。解放后，经过洼地改造，兴修水利，粮食产量虽然逐年增长，但是仍然没有完全摆脱自然灾害的威胁，产粮不足自给，年年缺粮。
    1958年秋，随着农业生产的大跃进和人民公社的诞生，鼓舞了王庄子人民战胜自然灾害的更大干劲。当年秋天播种的二千六百多亩小麦，普遍进行了深翻，种得适时。1959年夏季，麦苗长得齐胸深。社员们见到即将丰收的小麦，个个喜笑颜开。就在这时——5月30日深夜，不幸的事情发生了。西北风卷着暴雨，一阵猛烈的冲击，贾口洼的围埝决口了。凶猛的洪水，吞没了麦田，连已育好的五十亩水稻秧田也同归于尽。
    就是这天的后半夜，在村南场园上党支部大会召开了，天刚亮又召开了全村社员大会，经过反复讨论，大家一致提出：不向困难屈服，不让困难吓倒！西洼淹了东洼找，夏季丢了秋季找，丢了小麦抢种稻。
    时间已经是5月中旬，早稻插秧季节已过。东洼地里杂草丛生，待耕待整，秧苗还未培育，肥料也没备齐。但是在党支部的领导下，王庄子的农民不分男女，不怕风雨，由西洼转战到东洼，终于抢插了一千二百多亩晚稻。尽管晚稻不如早稻，但是由于社员们的精心管理，稻子还是生长得很好。一个夜晚，社员们正在队部里计划着收割稻谷的事情，突然传来了一阵惊人的霹雷声，大雨夹着冰雹倾盆而下。到第二天黎明，遍野白花花的冰雹还没有化尽，金黄色的稻谷所剩无几了。
        长“穷”志气
    一个本来家底就很薄的生产队，一年内遭受了两次毁灭性的自然灾害，全年几乎颗粒未收。这是多么沉重的打击啊！但是，灾害没有把他们吓倒，反而更激励了他们发愤图强、彻底改变贫困面貌的雄心大志。
    党支部书记陶令和在受灾后的党员干部大会上激动地说：“我们要长‘穷’志气，领导群众革‘穷’的命，今年收成不好，明年要来一个粮食大丰收，坚决摘掉穷帽子”。为了坚定大家的信心，党支部召开了一个“齐心会”。会上，饱尝旧社会痛苦的人们的一致意见是：今天受了灾，有党的领导，有人民公社这座靠山，有各行各业的热情支援，只要大家同心协力，完全有把握度过灾荒，改变面貌。究竟怎样改变面貌呢？社员们议论开了：“那儿也没有给咱蒸下馒头、磨下面。不干活跑到天边也不会富。”“要想由穷变富，就得自己动手种好庄稼，没有第二条道可走。”越讨论方向越明确，越争辩，干劲越足。“齐心会”开得大家齐了心。一个打捞残秋、抢种小麦、开展生产自救的高潮很快在全村形成了。
      拔　掉　穷　根
    今年2月，县委召开了四级干部会议，提出了以农业为基础、以粮为纲，多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，并且提出了全年增产指标。王庄子的干部们积极响应县委号召，他们认识到在当前还不能完全控制自然灾害的情况下，坚持多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针是增产粮食的关键，便决定扩大水稻种植面积，种了东洼种西洼，东洼不收西洼收，两洼丰收大富裕。
    会议结束后，他们立即回村传达了这个计划，广大干部、群众积极拥护，拍手赞成。但是，一些存有保守思想的人出来说话了：“种这么多水稻，别说插秧，就是育秧也完不成，不如少种保收好。”的确，种这么多水稻，也真是困难重重。全村每个劳力平均种稻三十多亩。当时，大片的稻田还没有水利工程，育秧池子也没有弄好，而育秧整地的时间又迫在眉睫。但是，所有这些，丝毫也没有动摇他们扩种水稻的决心。党支部一方面向广大干部群众讲解有利条件，指出：旱了，有贾口洼的水能自流灌溉；涝了，有排水沟、扬水站等可以排泄。另一方面深入实际，总结经验，大抓种植改革。支部副书记邓连绥、二小队队长王秉耀经过勘察地形，发现1958年深翻过的麦地上，退水后都有一层泥浆，就地撒种完全能够出好秧苗。他们边抹埂、边撒种，大大加快了育秧速度。原来育一分秧用三个工，改进后，育三分秧只用一个工。本田工程，他们也采取了随高就高，随洼就洼，打埝插秧，扩种淀稻的办法。这样不仅减少了工程量，节约了劳力，还使作物生长进一步适应了客观条件。
      人民的胜利
    为了胜利闯过水稻插秧关，党支部作出了这样一个决定：党员和干部必须站在生产最前线，要手脑并用，事事带头。党支部书记陶令和是个五十开外的人。挖渠时，他始终坚持劳动，没有歇过工，插秧时，泥里水里，抢着运秧插秧，检查验收。收工后，社员们歇了，他还要和干部们研究工作，安排生产。社员们心疼地说：“支书！干活有我们，你歇歇吧！”生产队长邓常润在二队劳动，发现了运秧供不上插秧，原因是拔秧的没有定额，工效低，供不上运。普遍推行劳动定额后，大大加快了插秧进度。在这一场战斗中，真正做到了：哪里有问题，哪里有干部的身影；哪里有困难，哪里有党员带头干。
    王庄子的农民在党员、干部的带动下沸腾起来了。他们集中一切可以集中的劳力，决心闯过水稻插秧关。当时，全村出动的劳力和辅助劳力达四百一十多人，占全村总人口数的60％。辅助劳力负责拔秧，壮劳力运秧，一般劳力插秧。因人制宜，发挥专长；展开竞赛，互相促进。全村农民奋战五十多天，抢种上水稻四千六百多亩，比1959年的种植面积增加了近三倍。
    插秧关闯过了，防涝的战斗紧接而来。滂沱大雨，淹没了洼下地区的稻苗，黑龙港河的水也在急速上涨着。社员们见到这种情景那能不着急呢！在公社党委统一领导下，一个排除沥涝的战斗又开始了。雨大劲足，水涨堤高，两天的时间，一条新的堤坝筑了起来。洼里的积水，经过疏通渠道，加紧扬水，也很快排出去了。沥涝的威胁，又被英雄的人们再一次征服了。
    广大社员怀着喜悦的心情正在紧张地收打稻谷。人们拿着株高穗大的稻禾情不自禁地说：“大办农业，大办粮食，听党的话没有错”！
