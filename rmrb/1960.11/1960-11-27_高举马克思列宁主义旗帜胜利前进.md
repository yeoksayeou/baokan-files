    Korean "Rodong Sinmun" Commemorates the Third Anniversary of the Moscow Declaration
    Advance Victoriously Under the Banner of Marxism-Leninism
    The Moscow Declaration summarized the experiences of the communist movement and socialist construction, and clarified the common tasks of struggle facing the communist parties and workers' parties of all countries. U.S. imperialism is constantly carrying out aggression around the world and frantically expanding its arms race. In order to strive for peace, it is necessary to strengthen the power and unity of the socialist camp, strengthen the unity of the people of all countries, and jointly conduct the anti-imperialist struggle. Revisionism is the main danger of the current international workers' movement, and it is necessary to resolutely oppose imperialism and revisionism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 25th: "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 23rd entitled "For the Victory of the Great Cause of Marxism-Leninism," commemorating the third anniversary of the Moscow Declaration.
    The editorial said that the meetings of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and representatives of communist and workers' parties of various countries held in Moscow were historical events signifying a new stage in the development of the international communist movement. The declaration adopted at this meeting summarized the experiences of the world communist and workers' movement and socialist construction, and clarified the common tasks of struggle facing the communist and workers' parties of all countries. The Moscow Declaration stipulated that the basic content of the development of our era is the transition from capitalism to socialism, which was started by the great October Socialist Revolution. The development of international relations, the victorious advance of the international communist movement, and the enormous growth of the workers' movement in recent years have realistically and clearly demonstrated the inevitable trend of current historical development.
    The editorial pointed out that on the international stage, the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has further decisively overwhelmed and surpassed the imperialist war forces in all aspects such as politics, economy, science, culture, and military affairs. Under the influence of the decisive strengthening and development of the power of the socialist camp, the anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist national liberation struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have developed to an unprecedented scale. The world capitalist system is undergoing an inevitable and increasingly deepening political and economic crisis and is declining and perishing. Within imperialist countries, the workers' movement and the broad democratic movement launched by the working people against the shackles of capital, against the imperialist war policies of various governments, and demanding democratic rights and improved living conditions are unprecedentedly high. On a global scale, the movement to defend peace is being carried out on an unprecedentedly organized scale.
    The editorial said that the international communist movement and the workers' movement have entered a new and great high tide period. The communist and workers' parties of various countries have undertaken the vanguard of this great work of transforming the world through revolution.
    The editorial said: The Korean Workers' Party has consistently been loyal to the principles pointed out in the Moscow Declaration since its creation. It said that the Korean Workers' Party has creatively applied the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to the specific historical conditions of Korea and has achieved great achievements in socialist transformation and socialist construction.
    The editorial said: We are constantly strengthening the unity and solidarity of our revolutionary headquarters—our Party—and its combat effectiveness, and achieving more brilliant achievements in the country's socialist construction, so as to firmly defend the eastern outpost of the socialist camp and make practical contributions to strengthening the power of the socialist camp.
    Our Party has gloriously fulfilled its responsibility to the international communist and workers' movement.
    The editorial pointed out that our Party has always been consistently loyal to proletarian internationalism and has made unremitting efforts to strengthen the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp.
    As the Moscow declaration points out, socialist countries base their mutual relations on the principles of complete equality, respect for the territorial integrity, respect for national independence and sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and especially comradely mutual assistance. The unshakable unity formed by the socialist camp according to these principles is unbreakable.
    The editorial said that the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp is the most important guarantee for bankrupting the imperialists' policies of aggression, striving for lasting world peace, and ensuring the victory of socialism. Precisely because of this, imperialists and their lackeys, the revisionists, are carrying out all kinds of malicious conspiracies in an attempt to undermine this unity and solidarity. However, all their conspiracies, as in the past, will inevitably be defeated in the future.
    The editorial said: For the victory of world peace and socialism, for the victory of our common cause, we must hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism in the future and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in every possible way. In particular, the firm unity with the people of our great neighbors, the Soviet Union and China, is an important guarantee for all the victories of our people. We cherish the friendship and solidarity with the people of these two countries at all times, and we are firmly united with all socialist countries.
    The editorial said that, as the Moscow Declaration pointed out, the invincible power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; the existence of peace-loving Asian and African countries that oppose imperialism and together with socialist countries constitute a vast peace zone; the decisive activities of the international working class and its vanguard, the communist parties, against war; the liberation movement of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries; and the enormous development of the mass movement of the people striving for peace—all these have created a realistic possibility of preventing war in the current period. However, as emphasized in the Moscow Declaration, as long as imperialism exists, there is soil for the outbreak of aggressive wars, and therefore the people of all countries must maintain the greatest vigilance against the danger of war caused by imperialism.
    The editorial condemned U.S. imperialism, as the chief culprit of international reaction, for constantly carrying out aggressive actions around the world, frantically intensifying the arms race, and exacerbating international tensions.
    The editorial emphasized that in order to stop the imperialists' aggressive war provocations and strive for lasting world peace, it is necessary to further strengthen the power and unity of the socialist camp, which is the fortress of world peace, strengthen the anti-imperialist national liberation struggle and the struggle of the people of capitalist countries. Only by strengthening the unity of all peace-loving people and carrying out a common struggle can peace be maintained.
    The editorial said that one of the last tricks the imperialists use to save themselves from defeat is to bring out their servants, the revisionists, to whitewash imperialism, in an attempt to paralyze the masses of the people's vigilance against imperialist aggression and create illusions about imperialism. The more severely imperialism fails, the more frantically it intensifies this ideological offensive. This proves that the Moscow Declaration correctly pointed out that revisionism is the main danger of the current international workers' movement. The existence of bourgeois influence is the domestic root of revisionism, and succumbing to the pressure of imperialism is the foreign root of revisionism. The editorial pointed out that we are building socialism today in a tense environment directly and sharply confronting the chief culprit of world reaction, U.S. imperialism, and our revolution continues to be arduous and long-term. This situation does not allow us to have any slackness. We must fight resolutely against imperialism and its servants, the revisionists, further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, repel any infringement by the enemy, and defend our socialist fruits. In addition, we must educate our working people with a revolutionary spirit and further firmly strengthen our ideological armament. In order to effectively carry out our revolutionary tasks, we must wage a tenacious struggle against dogmatism while opposing revisionism. People contaminated by dogmatism are lifeless and powerless to promote our revolution. The editorial concluded by saying that we will hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism in the future, be infinitely loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, unite more firmly around the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and effectively promote our country's revolutionary cause, so as to gloriously fulfill our obligations to the international communist movement.

    朝鲜《劳动新闻》纪念莫斯科宣言发表三周年
    高举马克思列宁主义旗帜胜利前进
    莫斯科宣言总结了共产主义运动和社会主义建设的经验，阐明了各国共产党和工人党面临的共同斗争任务。美帝国主义在世界各地不断进行侵略活动，疯狂扩军备战。为了争取和平，必须加强社会主义阵营的威力和团结，加强各国人民的团结，共同进行反帝斗争。修正主义是目前国际工人运动主要危险，必须坚决反对帝国主义和修正主义。
      新华社平壤25日电《劳动新闻》23日发表题为《为了马克思列宁主义伟大事业的胜利》的社论，纪念莫斯科宣言发表三周年。
    社论说，在莫斯科进行的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议以及世界各国共产党和工人党代表会议是意味着国际共产主义发展的新阶段的历史事件。这次会议通过的宣言总结了世界共产主义和工人运动以及社会主义建设的经验，并阐明了各国共产党和工人党面临的共同斗争任务。莫斯科宣言规定了我们时代发展的基本内容是由伟大的十月社会主义革命所开始的由资本主义向社会主义的过渡。近几年来的国际关系发展、国际共产主义运动胜利前进的进程和工人运动的巨大的成长，现实地进一步清楚地显示了当前历史发展的必然趋势。
    社论指出，在国际舞台上，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力在政治、经济、科学、文化、军事等一切方面进一步决定性地压倒和超过了帝国主义战争势力。在社会主义阵营威力的决定性的加强发展的影响下，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义、反殖民主义的民族解放斗争发展到了空前的规模。世界资本主义体系正经受着不可避免的日益深重的政治经济危机，正在衰退和没落着。在帝国主义国家内部，劳动人民展开的反对资本的枷锁、反对各国政府的帝国主义战争政策、要求民主权利和改善生活条件的工人运动和广泛的民主运动空前高涨。在全世界范围内，保卫和平的运动正以空前的有组织的规模开展着。
    社论说，国际共产主义运动和工人运动进入了新的巨大的高潮时期。各国共产党和工人党担当了这一用革命来改造世界的伟大工作的先锋。
    社论说：朝鲜劳动党从它创建之初就一贯忠实于莫斯科宣言指出的这一原则。它说，朝鲜劳动党把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理创造性地运用于朝鲜的具体的历史条件，取得了社会主义改造和社会主义建设的巨大成就。
    社论说：我们不断加强我们革命的参谋部——我们党的统一团结和它的战斗力，在国家的社会主义建设中取得更辉煌的成就，这样来牢固地保卫着社会主义阵营的东方前哨，为加强社会主义阵营的威力作出实际的贡献。
    我们党光荣地执行了它对国际共产主义和工人运动负有的责任。
    社论指出，我们党始终一贯地忠实于无产阶级国际主义，为加强社会主义阵营的团结一致进行了不懈的努力。
    正如莫斯科宣言所指出的，社会主义各国把相互关系建立在完全平等、尊重领土完整、尊重国家独立和主权，互不干涉内政、特别是同志的互相援助的原则上。社会主义阵营根据这些原则形成的不可动摇的团结一致是牢不可破的。
    社论说，社会主义阵营的团结一致是使帝国主义者的侵略政策破产、争取世界的持久和平、保证社会主义胜利的最重要的保证。正因为如此，帝国主义者及其走狗修正主义者进行种种的恶毒阴谋，企图破坏这种团结一致。但是，它们的一切阴谋活动，像过去一样，今后也不免要遭到失败。
    社论说：我们为了世界和平和社会主义胜利，为了我们共同事业的胜利，今后要高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，百般加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。特别是同我们伟大的邻邦——苏联和中国两国人民的牢固团结是我国人民一切胜利的重要保证。我们时刻珍视同这两个国家人民的友谊团结，并同所有社会主义国家牢固地团结在一起。
    社论说，正如莫斯科宣言所指出的，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可战胜的威力；反对帝国主义并同社会主义国家一起构成广大和平地区的亚非爱好和平国家的存在；国际工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党反对战争的决定性的活动；殖民地和半殖民地人民的解放运动；人民争取和平的群众运动的巨大发展——这一切造成了目前时期防止战争的现实的可能性。但是，如同莫斯科宣言所强调的，只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤，从而世界各国人民对于帝国主义所造成的战争危险必须保持最大的警惕。
    社论谴责美帝国主义作为国际反动的元凶在世界各地不断进行侵略行动，疯狂地加强军备竞赛，加剧国际紧张局势。
    社论强调说，为了制止帝国主义者的侵略战争挑衅，争取世界持久和平，要进一步加强世界和平的堡垒——社会主义阵营的威力和团结，加强反帝民族解放斗争和资本主义国家人民的斗争，只有加强一切爱好和平人民的团结，进行共同的斗争，才能维护住和平。
    社论说，帝国主义者为了挽回它们的失败，使出的最后手段之一就是搬出它的奴仆——修正主义者，来粉饰帝国主义，企图麻痹人民群众对帝国主义侵略的警惕性，制造对帝国主义的幻想。帝国主义失败得越利害就越疯狂地更加加强这种思想攻势。这证明了莫斯科宣言所正确地指出的：修正主义是目前国际工人运动的主要危险。资产阶级影响的存在，是修正主义的国内根源，屈服于帝国主义的压力，则是修正主义的国外根源。社论指出，我们今天在同世界反动的元凶——美帝国主义直接地、尖锐地相对峙的紧张的环境中建设社会主义，我们的革命继续带有艰苦性和长期性。这种情况不允许我们有任何的松懈，我们要为坚决反对帝国主义及其奴仆——修正主义而斗争，进一步加强无产阶级专政，击退敌人的任何侵害，保卫自己的社会主义果实。另外要以革命的精神教育我们的劳动人民，进一步牢固地加强思想武装。我们为了有成效地执行我们的革命任务，在反对修正主义的同时，也要为反对教条主义进行顽强的斗争。被教条主义污染的人毫无生气，在推行我们的革命中无能为力。社论最后说，我们今后将高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，无限地忠实于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义，更加牢固地团结在以金日成同志为首的党中央委员会的周围，有成效地推行我国的革命事业，以此来光荣地执行对国际共产主义运动承担的自己的义务。
