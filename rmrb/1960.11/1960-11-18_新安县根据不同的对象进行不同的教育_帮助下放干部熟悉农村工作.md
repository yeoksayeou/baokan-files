Xin'an County Implements Different Education Based on Different Objects
Help Cadres Sent Down to Familiarize Themselves with Rural Work

(Our report) The Xin'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province has adopted the method of "three educations" to quickly shorten the distance between the cadres recently sent down here, the local grassroots cadres, and the broad masses of commune members, which was caused by unfamiliarity with the situation and different work positions. This has enabled the three parties to quickly work together and devote themselves to the current "three autumns" production campaign and various rural tasks.

In enthusiastic response to the Party's call, leadership organs at all levels in Henan Province have recently sent down a large number of cadres to the front line of agricultural production to strengthen the leadership forces in counties, people's communes, and production brigades. To help these comrades quickly familiarize themselves with the situation and integrate with grassroots cadres and the broad masses of commune members, the Xin'an County Party Committee has conducted education with different content for three different objects: for the cadres sent down, the education focuses on correctly understanding the excellent rural situation and the original work foundation, fully relying on grassroots cadres and the broad masses of commune members to do a good job, and pointing out the advantages of grassroots cadres and the spirit of selfless labor of the masses. The cadres sent down are required to help grassroots cadres improve and help the masses summarize experiences, while also humbly learning from them; for grassroots cadres, the education focuses on warmly uniting and helping the cadres sent down to quickly familiarize themselves with the situation and play a greater role. They are also educated to humbly learn from the cadres sent down, because these cadres have a relatively high level of political theory and richer experience in struggle, which are valuable for actual production struggles; for commune members, they are told that this group of cadres sent down are taking on new jobs in the countryside in response to the Party Central Committee's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and to strengthen the agricultural production front. They will settle down in the countryside for a long time, and the commune members are asked to actively help them do their work and help their families quickly become familiar with production knowledge.

Before and after the arrival of the cadres sent down, Party committees at all levels in Xin'an County earnestly carried out the above three aspects of ideological education. As early as mid-September, Hao Xiqing, the first secretary of the county party committee, twice mobilized cadres throughout the county at the four-level cadres meeting and the general meeting of cadres directly under the county government, urging all cadres in the county to warmly welcome the cadres sent down who were about to embark on the agricultural front. Communes and production teams also conveyed to the broad masses of commune members the decision of the Provincial Party Committee to send down cadres to strengthen the grassroots leadership, which greatly encouraged the masses. After the arrival of the cadres sent down, they were warmly welcomed from the county to the production team. Responsible comrades of the county party committee and commune party committee personally introduced the situation to them, accompanied them to visit the local industrial and agricultural production development and the living conditions of the masses, and also used methods such as forums and interviews to enable this group of cadres to quickly familiarize themselves with the region's natural conditions and customs, organizational structure and personnel situation, work foundation and the living conditions of the masses, industrial development and long-term plans, as well as the current central work being carried out, and so on. Although the time has not been long since this group of cadres came to Xin'an County, due to the concrete nature of the above-mentioned measures, they have been able to immediately devote themselves to the current "three autumns" production campaign.

    新安县根据不同的对象进行不同的教育
    帮助下放干部熟悉农村工作
    本报讯　中共河南省新安县委会，采取“三教育”办法，使最近下放到这里的干部、本地基层干部和广大社员之间，很快缩短了由于情况生疏和工作岗位不同而造成的距离，使三者尽快的拧成一股绳，投入当前的“三秋”生产运动和农村的各项工作。
    河南省各级领导机关热烈的响应党的号召，最近下放了大批干部到农业生产第一线，加强县、人民公社和生产大队的领导力量。为帮助这些同志尽快熟悉情况并同基层干部、广大社员结合在一起，中共新安县委针对三种不同对象，分别进行不同内容的教育：对下放干部，是教育他们正确认识农村的大好形势和原来的工作基础，充分依靠基层干部和广大社员作好工作，并指出基层干部的优点和群众的忘我劳动精神，要求下放干部一方面要帮助基层干部提高，帮助群众总结经验，同时也要虚心向他们学习；对基层干部，教育他们要热情的团结和帮助好下放干部，使他们很快的熟悉情况，发挥更大的作用，同时也教育他们，要虚心向下放干部学习，因为这些干部的政治理论水平比较高，斗争经验也比较丰富，这些对实际生产斗争都是很宝贵的；对社员是向他们讲明这批下放干部是为了响应党中央大办农业大办粮食的号召，加强农业生产战线而走上新的工作岗位的，他们要在农村长期安家落户，要求社员积极帮助他们搞好工作，帮助他们的家属很快熟悉生产知识。
    在下放干部到达前后，新安县各级党委认真的进行了上述三方面的思想教育工作。还在9月中旬，县委第一书记郝喜庆同志就先后两次在全县四级干部会议上和县直属机关全体干部大会上，动员全县干部要热情的迎接即将走上农业战线的下放干部，公社和生产队还向广大社员传达了省委下放干部加强基层领导力量的决定，对群众鼓舞很大。下放干部到达以后，从县到生产队，均热情相待，县委和公社党委的负责同志亲自向他们介绍情况，陪同他们参观本地的工农业生产发展和群众生活情况，还用座谈访问等办法，使这批干部很快熟悉了这个地区的自然概况和风俗人情、组织机构和人事情况，工作基础和群众生活状况，工业发展和远景规划以及当前正在进行的中心工作等等。新来到新安县的这批干部，虽然时间不长，但由于上述措施具体，都能立即投入当前的“三秋”生产运动中。　（张胜彬）
