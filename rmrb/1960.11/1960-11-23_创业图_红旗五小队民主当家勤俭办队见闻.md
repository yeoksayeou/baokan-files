    Entrepreneurship Picture
    ——A Visit to the Red Flag Fifth Team's Democratic Management and Thrifty Team-Building
    An Haitian, First Secretary of the Suixian County Party Committee, CCP
    "The old saying goes: 'Outside there must be a rake, inside there must be a box. Don't worry about the rake having no teeth, just worry about the box having no bottom.' In the past, when families managed their own affairs, they looked for two good managers like a rake and a box. Now, a small team, a canteen, a home, needs several rakes and boxes to live well. Our team has several good rakes and boxes…"
    These words are the satisfied praise of the members of the Fifth Team of the Red Flag Production Team in the Zhaiwan Management Area of the Lishan Commune, Suixian County, for their team committee.
    In early October, I and several comrades stayed in the Fifth Team of the Red Flag Team for two days. Everyone introduced many methods of entrepreneurship, from which I learned a lot. Wang Honggui, the deputy captain of the team, said: "Two feet busy walking is for the body and mouth. Production! Originally, it was for eating and wearing, and the eating and wearing of more than one hundred people is a big problem, which cannot be borne by one or two people. A thousand catties of burden are carried by ten thousand people, and we rely on this one point—democratic management.”

Production Has Rakes, Management Has Boxes
    Let’s start with democratic management. The team committee of the Fifth Team of the Red Flag Team consists of ten people, including nine poor and lower-middle peasants and one middle peasant, truly making the poor and lower-middle peasants the masters. Six of these ten people are over forty years old. They worked as hired laborers and tenant farmers in the old society, experienced the bitterness and hardships of life, and have rich production experience. They are not only good at guiding production, seizing the seasons and grabbing time, but also good at managing and arranging household affairs and living frugally. They also actively shoulder the responsibility of cultivating and guiding the younger generation in the team committee, passing on their experience in managing production and life without reservation to the young people. Wang Honggui, who was born into a poor peasant family, is almost forty years old this year. In the old society, he worked as a long-term worker and tenant farmer. The hard life has tempered his family into frugal living people. He serves as the deputy captain of the team and is the second-in-command of the team. His daughter, Wang Xiuying, is fifteen years old this year. After graduating from elementary school, she took on the role of canteen administrator for the 169 people. She keeps the canteen accounts clear and manages the cooking utensils in an orderly manner. Wang Honggui grasps the overall arrangement of production on the one hand and manages life on the other. The team members praise him in unison: "He is both a production rake and a management box." Wang Zhengxue, who was born as a hired laborer, is forty-six years old this year. Since he started herding cattle for landlords, he has been dealing with cattle and farm implements all day long. He serves as the deputy captain of the team and is in charge of cattle and farm implements. The three team committee members and production team leaders, Wang Hongjin, Wang Hongsheng, and Wang Zhouyuan, are responsible for plowing and preparing the land, sowing, field management, water conservancy and irrigation, and harvesting. Their ages are all around forty or fifty, and they have rich production experience. There are three young successors in the team committee, the oldest being twenty-six years old and the youngest being seventeen years old. They come from poor peasant families and grew up in the new society. Under the dual education of the Party and their fathers and brothers, they have preliminary knowledge of politics, culture, and production to cope with real life, and a fiery heart to love and build the countryside. They listen to the Party, listen to the older generation, are enthusiastic and proactive in everything they encounter, and take the lead with vigor. Captain Luo Changcheng, a member of the Communist Youth League, is twenty-six years old this year. Don't look at his youth, he has been the head of this team for three years. In three years of being in charge, he has learned the ability to lead the overall work. He learned the frugal style from his father, learned production knowledge and common sense of household management from Wang Honggui and Wang Zhengxue, and learned to follow the mass line and talk about democracy in everything from Dai Chengcai, the deputy secretary of the Party branch (who is also a member of this team committee). The team committee meets once every three to five days to summarize and check the previous work and study and arrange the production tasks for the next stage. He models the implementation of the Party branch's resolutions, humbly listens to the suggestions of the older generation, and strictly requires each member of the team committee to complete the assigned tasks, while he himself takes the lead in production in a down-to-earth manner, doing more than 400 work points every month.晏Hongai, a young woman from a poor peasant family, is only twenty-two years old this year. She serves as the captain of the women's team. In addition to assisting the captain in arranging labor and leading thirty-two women in production, she is also responsible for solving the special problems of women and childcare. Wang Wenzhao, who was a primary school student two years ago, participated in production after graduating from primary school. He takes the lead in bearing hardships and production. He was elected by everyone as the deputy captain of the women's team.
    This team committee is composed of people with good composition, good history, proficient in production, frugal in managing the family, old and young, harmoniously united under the leadership of Captain Luo Changcheng. According to their respective specialties, they are responsible for labor arrangement, field management, cattle and farm implements, water conservancy and irrigation, living welfare, and other tasks. For three years, they have been completing the tasks assigned to them by the branch and the masses.
        Family Prosperity and Business Flourishing
    When the primary cooperative was established, this team only had ten cattle, and the combination of strong and weak was equivalent to four plows. In the past five years, only one cow died of old age, and it has developed to twenty-two cattle, equivalent to nine plows. It is not easy to develop so many cattle in the river fields where there is no pasture at all.
    The team has ten feeders, who are evaluated monthly and annually, and there are rules for rewards and punishments. The system has not been disrupted in the past five years, and the feeders have never been replaced randomly. They are all good middle and lower-middle peasant team members who love the community as their home and cherish cattle as their lives. Wang Zhenggu, a feeder who is sixty-five years old this year, is still reluctant to put down the cattle he has been feeding for five years. He said: "I understand the temper of the cattle, and the cattle are familiar with my temper. I am not at ease if I give it to someone else to feed." In his house, rows of nails are full of various ropes and halter heads for cattle. Even for such diligent feeders, Deputy Captain Wang Zhengxue has never missed a day to check the work of the feeders.
    In addition to managing cattle, Wang Zhengxue is also responsible for the management of farm implements for the entire team. This team did not use a penny of the production team's financial contract this year, but plows, harrows, ropes, rakes, and brooms are all complete. In 1958, the team only had eight plows, four harrows, and two cultivators, but now? There are seventeen plows, eight harrows, and four cultivators. There are two sets of ropes for plows, harrows, cultivators, and rollers, both single and double sets. There are also more than thirty sets of new ropes, and more than two hundred catties of stored hemp skin. Wang Zhengxue said: "People should have two sets of clothes to change, and plow and harrow ropes should also have two sets to change. In the busy farming season, grabbing fire, without two sets of tools, if one set is broken, it will affect production." Why does he think so carefully? How did he do so well? Their experience: first, production; second, cherish use. Just to solve the rope problem, the hemp planted in front of and behind the house this year yielded more than 360 catties. They distribute farm implements to users for safekeeping, give certain remuneration, and stipulate the limits of safekeeping and use, as well as the system of compensation for damage. The tools used for the rice field are handed over to the rice field keeper for management. In this way, more and more farm implements are added, and there has never been any loss.
        There are Experts on the Production Front
    "Those who can manage a family look at the edge of the shoes, those who can farm look at the edge of the field." An expert can tell at a glance that the work of this team is done well and meticulously. They plant well and manage well, which all depends on their two farming experts, one is Wang Hongjin, who is responsible for sowing, and the other is Wang Hongsheng, who is responsible for field management. These two team committee members serve as production team leaders respectively and directly lead the team members in production. First, let's talk about planting. This year, the team sowed more than 390 mu in autumn, and Wang Hongjin personally sowed more than 170 mu. After the team committee arranged the stubble according to local conditions, Wang Hongjin took on the responsibility of sowing quality and sowing time. He checked everything from land preparation to sowing. If the land was not leveled and finely prepared, the seeds were not treated well, and the fertilizer did not reach the field, he would not allow sowing. He insisted until the 390 mu were completed according to seasonal quality requirements. Let's talk about field management. Field management is a regular job. In addition to weeding, topdressing, and pest control, the biggest problem is water storage and water conservation, and clearing ditches and draining waterlogged areas. Wang Hongsheng, who is responsible for field management, recognized the problem accurately and grasped it tightly. He grasped clearing ditches and draining waterlogged areas for overwintering crops, and grasped water storage and water conservation for rice crops. This year, the team encountered a drought, and the rice area was planted with 170 mu, exceeding any year in history. As a result of the autumn harvest, the yield increased by 14.3% compared with the same period last year. Is the water conservancy condition good? No. The team only has four reservoirs, the source is short, and the water source is poor. If you don't grasp water storage, you can't plant seedlings. Under these conditions, in addition to Wang Hongsheng and the other three field managers being responsible for the water conservation and water use of the four reservoirs, he also arranged the team's sixteen strong laborers on the east, south, west, and north water source lines of each reservoir, responsible for opening ditches to divert water into the pond on rainy days. Whenever it rained, they went all out and went to each area to grab water. In this way, they resisted the drought and won a bumper harvest.
        Loyal Old Man
    As the saying goes: "Having an old man in the family is like having a treasure." There is such an old man in the team committee of the Fifth Team of the Red Flag Team. His name is Wang Longyuan, and he is more than fifty years old this year. He serves as an advisor in the team committee, and he personally leads vegetable production, ensuring that the team of more than one hundred people has more than enough vegetables for self-sufficiency. He led the team members to plant 45 mu of vegetable base and also intercropped 45 mu of vegetables. With more vegetable seeds, the old man built a shed in the vegetable garden and simply moved his quilt into the vegetable garden. In addition to the raid weeding and watering, which the team sent people to participate in, the old man managed his vegetable garden day and night. Under his careful cultivation, the fresh vegetables that could not be eaten were soaked in ten large jars in the canteen, and he also sold vegetables and vegetable seeds for more than 1,000 yuan. The team canteen used the money to add cooking utensils, build four new storage rooms, buy six piglets, and save more than 200 yuan in cash. The old man said excitedly in our conversation: "Come and see in a while, we will have dozens of jars of pickled vegetables in the canteen."
        An Excellent Fighting Team
    Usually, in general production teams, old women and children are not very noticeable; but in this team, they are a production fighting team. This is a group of people led by Wang Wenzhao, the young female captain. In addition to helping the canteen produce vegetables, they also collected more than 2,000 catties of cotton, more than 50 mu of sesame, soybeans, millet...etc., one grain, one leaf, one root, one flower at a time during the autumn harvest. All the odd jobs and light jobs in the team are all undertaken by them. As long as the team committee makes a decision and the task is assigned, Wang Wenzhao leads this team to do it separately, and each time they complete the task excellently and satisfactorily. The team members enthusiastically praised the young female commander of this team as a "capable girl."
        Thriving
    The democratic management and thrifty entrepreneurship of the team committee of the Fifth Team of the Red Flag Production Team has made this team a red flag in production and life. In 1958, the cultivated land area of this team was only 244 mu, but this year it has been expanded to 425 mu, and the annual grain output has increased a lot compared with 1958; the number of cattle and farm implements has increased; the canteen's family wealth has been thickened; as the living standard improves, people's mood has also changed. More than one hundred people live together in a harmonious socialist big family, striding forward on the broad road of socialism.

    创业图
    ——红旗五小队民主当家勤俭办队见闻
    中共随县县委第一书记　安海田
    “古话说：‘外头是个扒，屋里要个匣，不怕扒子没得齿，只怕匣儿没得底’。过去一家一户做人家，就看有没有这样一个扒、一个匣的两个好当家人；现在一个小队、一个食堂、一个家，就要多有几个扒、几个匣，日子才能过得好。我们这个小队就是有了几个好扒、好匣……。”
    这段话是随县厉山公社寨湾管理区红旗生产队五小队社员们对他们小队队委会的满意赞扬。
    10月初，我和几个同志到红旗队五小队住了两天。大家向我介绍了不少当家创业的方法，使我学了不少东西。小队副队长王洪贵说：“两脚忙忙走，为的身和口。生产嘛！本来就是为的吃、穿，一百多口人的吃穿是个大问题，不是一个人两个人就能担当得了的。千斤担子万人挑，我们就凭这一条——民主当家。”	      生产有扒　管家有匣
    就从民主当家说起吧，红旗队五小队的队委会由十人组成，其中有九个贫雇农，一个中农，真正是贫雇农当家作主。这十人中有六人的年龄在四十岁以上，他们在旧社会里当过雇工、佃户，经历了辛酸苦辣的生活，有丰富的生产经验，既善于指导生产，抓季节抢时间，又擅长料理安排家务，勤俭过日子。他们在队委会里还积极地肩负着培养辅导后一辈的责任，把管理生产、生活的经验毫无保留的传授给年轻人。贫农出身的王洪贵，今年四十挨边，在旧社会里当过长工、佃户，艰苦的生活，把他一家人都磨炼成勤俭过日子的人。他在小队里担任副队长，是小队的二把手。女儿王秀英，今年十五岁，小学毕业后，就担任这一百六十九人的食堂事务长，食堂的账目搞得清清楚楚，炊具用具料理得井井有条。王洪贵一手抓全面生产的安排布置，一手抓生活管理，小队的社员都异口同声的赞扬说：“他既是一个生产扒，又是一个管家匣。”雇工出身的王正学，今年四十六岁，从给地主放牛起就成天和耕牛农具打交道，他担任了小队副队长，专管耕牛农具。三个队委兼生产组长的王洪金、王洪升、王舟远，分工专管犁田整地、播种、田间管理、水利灌溉和收割打场，年龄都在四十挂零、五十挨边，生产经验丰富。队委会里边有三个年轻的接班人，年龄最大的二十六岁，最小的十七岁，他们出身贫农家庭，成长在新社会里，在党和他们父兄的双重教养下，有了应付现实生活的政治、文化、生产等方面的初步知识，有一付热爱农村建设农村的火热心肠，他们听党的话，听老一辈人的话，遇事积极热情，泼辣带头，生龙活虎。队长罗长成，共青团员，今年二十六岁，莫看他年轻，却已经是这个小队的三年的当家人了。三年的当家生活，他学会了领导全盘工作的本领。他从父亲那里学习了勤俭作风，从王洪贵、王正学那里学来了生产知识、管理家务的常识，从党支部副书记戴成才（也是这个小队的队委）那里学会了走群众路线、遇事讲民主。三、五天开一次队委会，总结检查上一段工作，研究布置下一段的生产任务。他模范地执行党支部的决议，虚心地听老一辈人的建议，严格地要求每个队委会的成员完成所分配的工作任务，而他自己则是扎扎实实地带头生产，每个月都做四百多工分。贫农出身的青年妇女晏红爱，今年才二十二岁，她担任了这个小队的妇女队长职务。她除了协助队长作好劳力安排、带领三十二个妇女生产以外，还负责解决妇女特殊问题及幼婴托育工作。两年前还是个小学生的王文照，小学毕业后，参加了生产，吃苦在前，生产带头，经大家选举担任了妇女副队长。
    这个队委会就是这样一伙成分好，历史好，生产内行，理家勤俭，老老小小、和和气气地团结在队长罗长成的领导下，按照各人的特长，分管劳力安排、田间管理、耕牛农具、水利灌溉、生活福利等各项工作，三年如一日，完成了支部和群众交给他们的任务。
          家兴业旺
    初级社成立时，这个小队仅仅只十头耕牛，强弱搭配折合四犋。五年来，只老死一头牛，发展到二十二头牛，折合成九犋牛。在这样根本就没有牧场的河畈地里，能发展到这么多牛。是件不容易的事。
    全队十个饲养员，月月评比，年年评比，奖惩都有规矩。五年来未打乱过制度，就是饲养员也从不乱更换。他们都是爱社如家，视牛如命的中贫农好社员。饲养员王正谷今年六十五岁，他还舍不得放下他喂了五年的一条耕牛。他说：“我摸住牛的脾气，牛也熟悉我的脾气，把它交给别人喂，我不放心。”在他的住房内，一排排的钉子上满满挂着耕牛的各种绳索扼头。即使是这样勤勤恳恳的饲养员，副队长王正学从没有放过一天不去检查饲养员的工作。
    王正学除了管耕牛以外，还负责全小队的农具管理。这个小队今年没有用生产队财务包干的一文钱，但是，犁耙绳索、杈扒扫帚，样样成双配套。1958年全队只八张犁、四张耙、两张耖子，而现在呢？却有十七张犁、八张耙、四张耖子，犁、耙、耖、碾磙上用的绳索单套双套都有两套，新的绳索还有三十多套，库存的麻皮还有二百多斤。王正学说：“人要有两套衣服换洗，犁耙绳索也得两套换洗，大农忙抢火色，没有两套工具，坏一套就要影响生产。”他为什么想得这样周到？搞得这样好？他们的经验：一是生产，二是惜用。光就解决绳索一项来说，今年在屋前屋后种的麻就收了三百六十多斤。他们把农具分到使用户保管，给予一定的报酬，规定保管使用的权限以及损坏赔偿制度。对于稻场用的工具就交给稻场保管员管理。这样一来，农具就越添越多，从没有出现过丢失现象。
        生产战线有能手
    “会做家的看鞋边，会种田的看田边。”这个队的活路，内行一看就会说干得好，做的细致。他们种得好也管得好，这就全靠他们有两个种田的行家，一个是负责播种的王洪金，另一个是负责田间管理的王洪升。这两个队委委员分别担任了生产组长，直接领导社员生产。先说种吧，今年这个队秋播三百九十多亩，王洪金个人亲手就播种一百七十多亩。队委会因地制宜、安排好茬口，王洪金就挑起播种质量和播种时间的担子。从整田到下种，样样他都检查到，田整的不平不细，种子处理得不好，肥料不到田，他不让下种，他一直坚持到三百九十亩按季节质量要求完成了任务。再说田间管理吧，田间管理是个经常性的活路，除了锄草、追肥、防虫害以外，最大的问题是蓄水保水，清沟排渍。负责田间管理的王洪升认识得很准，抓得很紧，越冬作物他抓清沟排渍，水稻作物他抓蓄水保水。今年这个小队遇了天旱，而水稻面积插了一百七十亩，超过历史上任何一年，秋收结果产量比去年同期增产14.3％。是水利条件好吗？不。全队只有四口堰塘，来路短，水源差，抓不住蓄水就插不上秧。在这种条件下，王洪升除了和其他三个田间管理员分管四口堰塘的保水、用水工作以外，他还把全队十六个强劳动力分别安排在每个堰塘的东南西北水源线上，负责雨天开沟引水入塘。每逢雨天，他们全力以赴，各到各片去抓水，就这样抗住了天旱，夺取了丰收。
        忠诚的老人
    常言说得好：“家里有个老，就是一个宝。”红旗五小队队委会委员里就有这样一个老人，他名叫王龙远，今年五十多岁了。他在队委会里担任了顾问，他并且亲自负责领导蔬菜生产，保证了全队一百多口人的蔬菜自给有余。他领导社员种了四十五亩蔬菜基地，还套种了四十五亩蔬菜，菜种多了，老人在菜园地里盖了一间草棚，干脆把被子搬到菜园里去住下来，除了突击性的除草、浇水队上派人参加以外，老人日日夜夜的经营他的菜园。在他的精心培育下，吃不了的鲜菜食堂里泡了十大缸，还卖菜、卖菜籽收入了一千多元钱。小队食堂用这笔钱添置了炊具，新盖了四间保管室，买了六头小猪，还存现金二百多元。这个老人在和我们谈话中兴奋地说：“过些时来看吧，我们食堂的腌菜，就是几十缸了。”
        一支出色的战斗队
    通常在一般生产队里，老婆婆、小孩子是不大引人注目的；而在这个小队里，他们却是一支生产战斗队。这就是年纪轻轻的女小队长王文照领导的一班子人。她们十个老婆婆、八个少年，除了帮助食堂生产蔬菜之外，秋收中两千多斤棉花、五十多亩芝麻、黄豆、粟谷……等，都是他们一粒粒、一叶叶、一根根、一朵朵收拣回家，队里所有零杂活、轻活，全部都是他们一手承担。只要队委会一决定，任务一分配下来，王文照就带领着这支队伍，分头去做，每次都是出色的令人满意的完成任务。社员们热情的赞扬这支队伍的年轻女指挥员是个“能干的女孩子”。
          欣欣向荣
    红旗生产队五小队队委会民主当家，勤俭创业的作风，使这个队成为生产、生活上的一面红旗。1958年这个队的耕地面积只有二百四十四亩，而今年就已经扩大到四百二十五亩，全年粮食产量比1958年增长很多；耕牛农具增加了；食堂家底搞厚了；随着生活的提高，人的心情也变化了。一百多口人聚住在一个和睦的社会主义大家庭里，在社会主义的康庄大道上迈步前进。
