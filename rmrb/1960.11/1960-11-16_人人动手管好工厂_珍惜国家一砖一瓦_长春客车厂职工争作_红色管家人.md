Changchun, November 15th (Report from our newspaper) – While strengthening ideological education on diligence and thrift among its workers, the Changchun Passenger Car Factory has launched a mass movement to create "Red Housekeepers." In the movement, a large number of activists who love the factory like their home and cherish every nail, iron piece, brick, and tile of the country have emerged; a new atmosphere of "everyone loves the factory, everyone is a housekeeper" is taking shape.

The name "Red Housekeeper" evolved from "Good Housekeeper." Originally, there was a group of veteran workers in this factory who loved the factory like their home, and the masses always called them "Good Housekeepers." Veteran worker and Communist Party member Wang Zhongshun, whom the masses called "his heart never leaves the Party, his body never leaves the factory," has managed over two thousand kinds of equipment, tools, and materials, and nothing has been lost in several years. Once, the workshop lost a steel cable. He searched inside and outside the factory for more than a week and finally found it. Whenever there were windy or rainy nights, this old man in his fifties would brave the wind and rain, travel several miles to the workshop to check the equipment and close the doors and windows; in the event of strong winds and heavy rain, he would squat alone in the huge factory building all night guarding it. In order to save the country every bit of capital, old welder Kang Decai used the small baking oven he built and the scrap steel he picked up to make pliers, wrenches, hand hammers, shovels, spades, and picks. Since the fourth quarter of last year, his team has not received any tools from the public. During the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the exemplary deeds of these veteran workers spread throughout the factory. Some workers said: "If every worker in the factory is like these old housekeepers, our factory will be run excellently!" In order to widely disseminate the advanced deeds of these veteran workers, the factory Party committee promptly made a decision to launch the "Red Housekeeper" movement.

Since the launch of the movement, Communist Youth League organizations at all levels have organized League members and young workers to visit the "Old Housekeepers." The older generation of workers told the young workers about the suffering they had endured in the old society. Through comparing the old and new societies, the broad masses of workers further realized that today's happiness did not come easily, thereby establishing correct viewpoints and resolving the problems of public versus private, individual versus the state, and the two kinds of thinking and styles of work regarding thrift and waste. All the factory's workers also widely read and discussed Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "A Letter to Comrade Xu Teli."

On the basis of extensive ideological education, an activity of setting up models and planting red flags was then launched, and more than 400 "Red Housekeepers" were selected successively. In order to utilize scrap material the size of copper coins, young worker Zhang Decai worked day and night, pouring over hundreds of craft files, searching for targets among more than a thousand kinds of parts, going through more than five hundred kinds before finally utilizing the scrap steel the size of copper coins. One Saturday afternoon, apprentice Zou Shuqin did not go to the workshop because of a meeting. That night, a wind suddenly blew, and she was worried that the doors and windows of the workshop had not been closed properly. She quickly got out of bed, ran several miles to the workshop, and closed the doors and windows.

Since the "Red Housekeeper" movement was launched, a new situation of "everything is taken care of by someone" has rapidly emerged in the factory. The production capacity of the equipment has been continuously increasing. According to statistics, the mechanical processing efficiency of the entire factory has increased by an average of 50% compared to before the movement, labor productivity has increased by 23%, and the cost of each passenger car has been reduced by 14.96%.

### 人人动手管好工厂  珍惜国家一砖一瓦  长春客车厂职工争作“红色管家人”

    人人动手管好工厂  珍惜国家一砖一瓦
    长春客车厂职工争作“红色管家人”
    本报长春15日电　长春客车厂在加强对职工进行勤俭节约思想教育的同时，开展了“红色管家人”的群众运动。运动中涌现出大批爱厂如家、珍惜国家一钉一铁、一砖一瓦的积极分子；“人人爱厂，个个管家”的新风气正在形成。
      “红色管家人”这个名字，是从“好管家”演变来的。原来，这个工厂有一批爱厂如家的老工人，群众一向称他们为
  “好管家”。被群众称为“心不离党，身不离厂”的老工人、共产党员王忠顺，他经手管理的二千多种设备、工具和材料，几年以来一直没有丢失过一件。有一次，车间丢了一股钢绳，他在厂内厂外找了一个多星期，终于找了回来。每当夜间刮风下雨，这个五十多岁的老人，都要迎风冒雨，从几里之外，赶到车间，检查设备，关闭门窗；遇到大风大雨，就一个人蹲在巨大的厂房里通宵守护。老焊工康德才为了给国家节省一点一滴的资财，他用自己砌的小烘炉，拣来的废钢铁，打造钳子、扳子、手锤、铲子、锹、镐。去年第四季度以来，他所在的小组没有向公家领过工具。在增产节约运动中，这些老工人的模范事迹传遍了全厂。有的工人说：“如果全厂每个工人都像这些老管家一样，我们的工厂就会办得呱呱叫！”为了广泛传播这些老工人的先进事迹，工厂党委及时作出了开展“红色管家人”运动的决定。
    运动开展以来，各级共青团组织，纷纷组织团员和青年工人去拜访“老管家”。老一代的工人向青年工人讲述了在旧社会受过的苦难，通过新旧社会的对比，使广大职工进一步认识到今天的幸福来之不易，从而树立正确的观点，解决公与私、个人与国家、节约与浪费两种思想两种作风的问题。全厂职工还普遍阅读和讨论了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《给徐特立同志的一封信》等文章。
    在广泛进行思想教育的基础上，接着掀起了大树标兵、大插红旗的活动，先后评选出四百多名“红色管家人”。青年工人张德才为了把铜钱那么大的边角余料利用起来，废寝忘食，翻阅了几百份工艺档案，在一千多种零件中查找对象，翻遍五百余种，终于把铜钱那么大的废钢材利用起来了。一个星期六的下午，徒工邹淑琴因开会没到车间去。夜间突然刮起风来，她担心车间的门窗没有关好，连忙从铺上爬起来，跑几里路赶到车间关好了门窗。
    “红色管家人”运动开展以后，全厂迅速出现了一个“事事有人管”的新局面。设备的生产能力不断增长。据统计，目前全厂机械加工效率比运动前平均增加50％，劳动生产率提高了23％，每辆客车的成本降低了14.96％。
