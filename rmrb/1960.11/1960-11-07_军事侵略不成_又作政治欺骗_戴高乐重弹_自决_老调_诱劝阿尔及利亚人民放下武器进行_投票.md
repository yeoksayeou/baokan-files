    Xinhua News Agency, November 5th, Paris Dispatch: Facing the failure of both military conquest and political inducement on the Algerian question, and with increasingly unstable domestic rule, French President De Gaulle delivered a televised speech last night.

    De Gaulle could not hide his anxiety and frustration in his speech. He described the strong support of the world's righteous people for the Algerian people's struggle for independence as a so-called "threat from totalitarians" and admitted that France "has encountered various serious problems in Africa."

    He focused on what he called the "serious Algerian problem." However, his speech showed no change in France's colonial policy towards Algeria. He still refused to negotiate with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria to guarantee the independence or self-determination of the Algerian people, insisting that the Algerian National Liberation Army first lay down its arms before discussing anything else. He refused to recognize the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria as representing the Algerian people and slandered the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria as "claiming to be the rulers of Algeria." He also said that Algeria "has never been a nation nor a country," and that the Republic of Algeria "has never existed." De Gaulle also refused to withdraw French troops from Algeria before the "vote" he promised regarding the future of Algeria.

    Nevertheless, De Gaulle still used a lot of space in this speech to peddle his so-called "self-determination" fraud for the Algerian people, using flowery language to entice the Algerian National Liberation Army to lay down their arms, trying to make them believe that as long as they accept France's preconditions, through "voting," the Algerian people can "freely choose" "an independent Algeria, in which Algerians themselves will decide their destiny," and that "France will not oppose any solution determined by voting," and so on. After several failed attempts to induce surrender, De Gaulle made this futile effort again, indicating that he could not find a way out of the dead end.

    军事侵略不成　又作政治欺骗
    戴高乐重弹“自决”老调
    诱劝阿尔及利亚人民放下武器进行“投票”
    新华社5日讯　巴黎消息：面临着在阿尔及利亚问题上军事征服和政治诱降两套手段都已经失败以及国内统治日益不稳的困境，法国总统戴高乐昨天晚上发表了一篇电视广播演说。
    戴高乐在演说中掩盖不住他内心的焦虑和沮丧。他把世界正义人民对阿尔及利亚人民独立斗争的有力支持说成是所谓“集权主义者的威胁”，并承认法国“在非洲遇到了摆在它面前的各种严重问题。”
    他着重谈了他称之为“严重的阿尔及利亚问题”。但是从他的演说中看不出法国对阿尔及利亚的殖民主义政策有什么改变。他仍然拒绝同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府谈判让阿尔及利亚人民独立或者自决的保证，坚持要阿尔及利亚民族解放军首先放下武器，再谈其他。他拒不承认阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府代表阿尔及利亚人民，并且诬蔑阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府“自命是阿尔及利亚的统治者”。他还说，阿尔及利亚“这个地方从来就既不是一个民族也不是一个国家”，阿尔及利亚共和国“还从来没有存在过”。戴高乐还拒绝在他所许诺的关于决定阿尔及利亚未来的公民“投票”举行之前把法国军队撤出阿尔及利亚。
    尽管如此，戴高乐在这次演说中仍然用了许多篇幅兜卖他的所谓让阿尔及利亚人民“自决”的骗局，花言巧语地诱劝阿尔及利亚民族解放军放下武器，企图使他们相信，只要接受法国的这种先决条件，通过“投票”，阿尔及利亚人民就可以“自由选择”“一个独立的阿尔及利亚，在这个阿尔及利亚里，阿尔及利亚人自己将决定他们的命运”，“法国将不反对通过投票所确定的任何解决办法”等等。戴高乐在几次诱降失败以后，又作出这种徒然的努力，表明他找不到走出死胡同的出路。
