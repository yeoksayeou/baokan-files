Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 9th -- Anshan Iron and Steel's workers have launched a vigorous rapid steelmaking movement and achieved significant results. In October, the average smelting time per furnace was reduced by thirty-seven minutes, and steel production achieved a large-scale bumper harvest.

Conducting a rapid steelmaking movement is a key measure for Anshan Iron and Steel to complete and overfulfill its annual steel production plan. Under the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in mid-October, each open hearth furnace proposed to shorten the smelting time of each furnace from about thirteen hours to eleven hours, based on consolidating increased loading and maintaining the furnace body well. At the end of September, the No. 4 open hearth furnace of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant was still a "slow furnace"; it took thirteen or fourteen hours to smelt a furnace of steel. At that time, some people complained that the furnace's overhaul quality was not good, and some said that it was delayed by waiting for large ladles and molds, emphasizing many objective conditions. However, under the leadership of the Party branch, the workers of this furnace focused on improving their own work and found the root cause of the long steelmaking time. All the workers in the furnace launched a rapid steelmaking performance competition focusing on the furnace head fire blocking and other key factors affecting the long steelmaking time, and strengthened cooperation to create favorable conditions for rapid steelmaking with each other. As a result, they took the lead in breaking through the eleven-hour mark for smelting a furnace of steel. From October 15th to 19th, more than half of the nine furnaces of steel smelted by this furnace had smelting times of less than eleven hours. The No. 4 open hearth furnace workers were determined to strengthen themselves, overcome difficulties, and their actions encouraged the workers of each open hearth furnace in Anshan Iron and Steel. Many open hearth furnaces also successively broke through the target of smelting a furnace of steel in eleven hours. In the past, the No. 7 open hearth furnace was called the "old cow furnace" because of its long steelmaking time. The workers of this open hearth furnace earnestly studied the advanced experience of the No. 4 open hearth furnace, caught up quickly, and continuously smelted six furnaces of rapid steel, with a smelting time of only seven or eight hours per furnace. Anshan Iron and Steel's open hearth furnace king -- the workers of the No. 24 open hearth furnace of the No. 3 Steelmaking Plant, brought into play even greater revolutionary vigor, earnestly implemented the open hearth furnace operation policy, and on the basis of maintaining the furnace body well and consolidating increased loading, they once produced two furnaces of steel per day for six consecutive days. On October 23rd, they smelted a furnace of steel in nine minutes and fifty seconds; then, on the 25th, they created the excellent achievement of producing three furnaces of steel per day. On this day alone, this open hearth furnace produced 765 tons of high-quality steel for the country.

The Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee promptly summarized the rapid steelmaking experience of the No. 4 open hearth furnace and other open hearth furnaces, and also inserted red flags in each steel plant and established five rapid steelmaking model furnaces. At the same time, a grassroots cadre conference was held to exchange and promote the experience of rapid steelmaking; advanced producers, rapid steelmaking experts, and furnace protection pacesetters from each steel plant were organized into rapid steelmaking performance teams, and they performed activities of increased loading, rapid smelting, and furnace body maintenance in three steel plants respectively, so that continuous rapid smelting and high yield in one furnace quickly developed into continuous rapid smelting and high yield in each open hearth furnace. On October 27th, seven open hearth furnaces in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant participated in production. On this day, 50% of the total number of furnaces produced by the plant were rapid steelmaking, and the average smelting time of the entire plant was shortened to ten hours and thirty-one minutes. The daily output reached a level never reached when seven open hearth furnaces were in production in the past. In the last ten days of October, the average smelting time per furnace in this plant was one hour and three minutes shorter than in the previous twenty days, and the hourly output increased by 2.87 tons.

The Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Committee promptly strengthened their leadership over this movement, and in response to the new contradictions that constantly emerged in the production movement, they mobilized the masses to effectively solve every specific problem in production. When the rapid steelmaking movement started, the Municipal Party Committee and the company Party Committee found that the furnace rear operation, transportation work, and production scheduling work could not keep up, so they concentrated all their efforts on solving these three outstanding contradictions, further promoting production.

In the rapid steelmaking movement, Anshan Iron and Steel's factories and mines fully developed the spirit of communist large-scale cooperation. All Anshan Iron and Steel's workers twisted together up, down, left, and right, and spared no effort to create conditions and pave the way for rapid steelmaking. Workers in iron smelting plants, scrap iron plants, and mines vigorously supported higher quality and larger quantities of molten iron, scrap steel, ore, and other raw materials, and never allowed steelmaking workers to delay a minute of steelmaking time by waiting for molten iron or ore. Workers in various auxiliary departments supported rapid steelmaking with sufficient electricity, water, gas, oxygen, and steam. Repair workers rushed to make various key spare parts and components for steelmaking on open hearth furnaces in a timely manner and delivered them to the door. Repair and demolding workers tried every possible means to ensure the timely supply of steel ladles, iron ladles, slag ladles, and ingot molds. Transportation workers organized shock teams around rapid steelmaking to carry out fast loading and unloading to ensure high output with high transportation. (Attached photo)

    上下左右拧成一股绳力争超额完成今年钢产计划
    鞍钢职工掀起快速炼钢运动
    十月份各平炉每炉冶炼时间平均缩短37分钟，钢产量大面积丰收
    新华社鞍山9日电　鞍钢职工开展声势浩大的快速炼钢运动取得显著成绩。10月份各座平炉平均每炉钢的熔炼时间缩短了三十七分钟，钢产量获得大面积丰收。
    开展快速炼钢运动，是鞍钢完成和超额完成全年钢产计划的关键措施。在中共鞍山市委的领导下，10月中旬，各座平炉提出在巩固多装、维护好炉体的基础上，每炉钢冶炼时间要由十三小时左右缩短到十一时。第一炼钢厂四号平炉在9月末还是一座“慢炉子”；每炼一炉钢要十三、四个小时。当时有人埋怨这个炉子检修质量不好，有人说是因为等大罐、等模子耽误的，强调客观条件多。但是，这个炉子的职工在党支部领导下，从改进自己的工作着眼，找出了炼钢时间长的根本原因。全炉职工围绕炉头挡火等影响炼钢长的时间关键，展开快速炼钢表演竞赛，并加强协作，互相创造快速炼钢的有利条件，结果，率先突破十一小时炼一炉钢的大关。这个炉从10月15日到19日炼出的九炉钢，熔炼时间在十一小时以下的占一半以上。四号平炉职工发愤图强，战胜困难的行动，鼓舞了鞍钢各座平炉职工，许多平炉也先后突破十一小时炼一炉钢的指标。七号平炉过去因为炼钢时间长，被称为“老牛炉”。这座平炉的职工，认真学习四号平炉的先进经验，急起直追，连续炼出六炉快速炼钢，每炉钢的熔炼时间都只有七、八个小时。鞍钢平炉王——第三炼钢厂二十四号平炉职工，发挥了更大的革命干劲，认真贯彻执行平炉操作方针，在维护好炉体、巩固多装的基础上，曾连续六天日产两炉钢，10月23日，用九点五十分钟炼出一炉钢；接着，在25日又创造出了日产三炉钢的优异成绩。仅这一天，这座平炉就为国家多生产七百六十五吨优质钢。
    中共鞍山市委、鞍钢党委，及时地总结四号平炉和其它平炉快速炼钢的经验，又在各钢厂大插红旗，树立了五座快速炼钢标兵炉。同时，又召开基层干部大会，交流推广快速炼钢的经验；把各钢厂的先进生产者、快速炼钢能手和护炉标兵，组成快速炼钢表演队，分别在三个炼钢厂进行多装、快炼和维护炉体的表演活动，从而使一个炉子的连续快炼高产，迅速发展到各座平炉连续快炼高产。第一炼钢厂在10月27日有七座平炉参加生产，这一天全厂出钢的总炉数有50％是快速炼钢，全厂平均熔炼时间缩短到十小时三十一分钟，日产量达到了过去七座平炉生产时从未达到过的水平。10月下旬，这个厂平均每炉钢的熔炼时间较前二十天缩短一小时零三分钟，小时产量提高二点八七吨。
    中共鞍山市委和鞍钢党委及时加强对这一运动的领导，针对生产运动中不断出现新的矛盾，发动群众，切实地解决生产中每一个具体问题。当快速炼钢运动起来后，市委和公司党委发现炉后操作、运输工作和生产调度工作跟不上，便集中全力解决这三个突出矛盾，进一步促进了生产。
    在快速炼钢运动中，鞍钢各厂矿充分发扬了共产主义大协作的精神，全鞍钢职工上下左右拧成一股绳，都不遗余力地为快速炼钢创造条件，铺平道路。炼铁厂、碎铁厂和矿山的工人，大力支援质量更好、数量更多的铁水，废钢、矿石等原料，决不使炼钢工人因等铁水，等矿石而耽误一分钟的炼钢时间。各辅助部门的工人，以足够的电、水、煤气、氧气、蒸气支援了快速炼钢。机修工人把平炉上炼钢用的各种关键备品配件及时赶制出来，送上门去。修里和脱模工人，千方百计地保证钢水罐、铁水罐、渣罐和钢锭模的及时供应。运输工人围绕快速炼钢，组织突击队进行快装，快卸，以高运保高产。（附图片）
