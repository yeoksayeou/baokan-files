Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th - Employees of the Gongxian Chemical Plant in Henan Province are using indigenous blast furnaces to produce calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer. By the end of October, they had produced 1,540 tons.

Calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer has a high fertilizer effect, comparable to superphosphate. However, the production process is simpler than that of superphosphate, and it can be produced without sulfuric acid, making it an important way to increase phosphate fertilizer production.

In order to ensure that the produced calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer can be used in farmland in a timely manner, the factory also sent seven technicians to rural people's communes and production teams to conduct publicity, supply, and impart fertilization techniques. After 90 mu of cotton fields in the Zhenxi Brigade of the Huiguozhen Commune applied calcium magnesium phosphate fertilizer, the original third-class cotton quickly turned into first-class cotton, with an average yield per unit area increasing by about 17% compared to cotton fields that had not been fertilized. Fertilization of two mu of cornfields in the Xiaonan Brigade of the Xiaoyi Commune resulted in an increase of 75 jin of grain per mu compared to unfertilized corn.

    钙镁磷肥制造容易肥效大
    新华社郑州20日电　河南省巩县化工厂职工用土高炉生产钙镁磷肥，到10月底已经生产出一千五百四十吨。
    钙镁磷肥肥效高，同过磷酸钙不相上下，但生产过程比过磷酸钙简易，而且可以不用硫酸，是增产磷肥的一个重要途径。
    为了使所产钙镁磷肥能及时用在农田上，这个厂还派出七名技术员到农村人民公社、生产队，边宣传、边供应、边传授施肥技术。回郭镇公社镇西大队九十亩棉田施用钙镁磷肥以后，原来的三类棉迅速变为一类棉，平均单位面积产量比未施的棉田增产17％左右。孝义镇公社孝南大队二亩玉米地施肥结果，比未施肥的玉米每亩多打粮食七十五斤。
