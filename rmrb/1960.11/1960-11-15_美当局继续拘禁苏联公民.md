Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: TASS, New York, November 10th, reports: The United States Federal Court yesterday heard the case regarding the transfer of Soviet citizen Melekh, who was illegally arrested by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, to Chicago. The US authorities are forcibly seeking an excuse for doing so, claiming that the "indictment" against Melekh was filed by the Chicago court. Melekh's defense lawyer, Koreinman, pointed out that not only is the transfer of Melekh to Chicago illegal, but his arrest is also illegal because Melekh enjoys diplomatic immunity.

    美当局继续拘禁苏联公民
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社纽约10日讯：美国联邦法院昨天审理了关于把美国联邦调查局非法逮捕的苏联公民梅列赫转移到芝加哥的问题。美国当局强为这样做找寻借口，说什么因为对梅列赫的“控诉”是由芝加哥法院提出的。梅列赫的辩护律师科列因曼指出，不仅把梅列赫转移到芝加哥是不合法的，而且逮捕他也是不合法的，因为梅列赫享有外交豁免权。
