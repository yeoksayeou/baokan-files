Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th -- The Lao Fighting Forces Radio Station today issued a commentary welcoming the Phouma government's statement that it would not execute any orders that the King might issue under pressure from the traitorous clique. The commentary said that this statement has won the sympathy of all patriotic and peace-loving Lao people and has been warmly welcomed by the Lao Patriotic Front.

The commentary pointed out that the traitorous officers in Luang Prabang, on the surface loyal to the Phouma government, are secretly carrying out the rebellion plotted by U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique.

The commentary pointed out that the purpose of the rebels is to surround and coerce the King in order to carry out their conspiracy, overthrow the legitimate government, and establish their dictatorial system.

The commentary said that the government's announcement of the above-mentioned statement is correct and necessary when the King (possibly) makes decisions that the King does not agree with under siege and coercion. This approach is to prevent the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique from using the King's name to realize their traitorous colonial conspiracy.

The commentary said that the Lao people hope that the government will stand firm, adhere to the above-mentioned firm attitude, and refuse to make concessions to the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique.

The commentary pointed out that historical experience proves that the only way to implement a policy of peace and neutrality is to unite all the forces of the nation and resolutely oppose the enemies of the nation – the traitorous clique.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th -- Washington Dispatch: The U.S. State Department yesterday openly interfered in Laotian internal affairs, putting pressure on Laotian Prime Minister Prince Phouma not to "use force" against the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group's rebellion in Luang Prabang.

State Department spokesman White supported this rebel group at a press conference, saying that if the Laotian government "openly uses force, it will further aggravate the situation and lead to further divisions." He also nonsensically claimed that this "may make it easier for the Communists to gain new ground."
