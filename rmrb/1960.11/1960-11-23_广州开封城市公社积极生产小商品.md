Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: The industry of the urban people's communes in Guangzhou is implementing the policy of commune-run industry serving the people's livelihood and vigorously developing the production of small commodities. At present, the small commodities produced by commune-run industries in the city have increased from more than 700 varieties last year to more than 1,200. From January to October this year, products that are living materials accounted for 60% of the total output value completed by commune-run industries, with small commodities accounting for the vast majority.

    The management departments of various urban people's communes in Guangzhou have made the development of small commodity production an important aspect of commune-run industry. Many people's communes also guarantee the completion of small commodity production plans by determining factories, varieties, and output. A considerable number of small commodities such as shoe nails, shoe sizes, buttons, wooden clothespins, mesh bags, hairbrushes, wooden clogs, and hairpins supplied in the Guangzhou market are produced by commune-run industries. From January to October this year, commune-run industries in the city supplied the market with more than 136,000 pairs of cloth shoes, more than 58,000 dozens of gloves, and more than 210,000 dozens of buttons.

    In developing the production of small commodities, Guangzhou's commune-run industries make full use of the scraps and waste materials from large factories and the waste and old materials from waste product recycling departments. The Qingping Commune Hardware Factory used the scraps from state-owned hardware factories to produce 1.57 million pairs of shoe sizes from January to October this year. The Wenchang Commune Rubber Factory uses waste car tires to process more than 6,000 pairs of rubber shoe soles and more than 12,000 pieces of clog skin every month.

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: Kaifeng City, Henan Province, has formed a small commodity production network with urban people's commune-run industries as its core. There are 430 factories producing small commodities in the city, and the variety of products has increased from 1,246 in the first quarter of this year to 2,194 in the third quarter. More than 100 new products were added in October. Now, the market presents a prosperous scene of brisk buying and selling and rich and colorful varieties.

    Some small commodity production in Kaifeng City has a long history and tradition. In order to maintain and develop the production of these products, the city's industrial and commercial departments cooperated closely and carried out a "passing on the torch" movement for small commodity production. In addition to the continued production of famous scissors, kitchen knives, veils, and Bian silk, the production of soap, perfumed soap, enamel products, and carbon paper has recently been developed. These products have novel designs, low costs, and good quality. The development of small commodity production has greatly changed the past situation where "major products relied on Tianjin and Shanghai, and small commodities relied on Suzhou and Hangzhou" for supply. At present, many small commodities produced in the city have more than enough to meet their own needs, and more than 400 kinds of products are also sold to Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Hebi and other places.

    广州开封城市公社积极生产小商品
    据新华社广州电　广州市各城市人民公社工业贯彻社办工业为人民生活服务的方针，大力发展小商品生产。现在全市社办工业生产的小商品，已由去年的七百多种增加到一千二百多种。今年1至10月份社办工业完成的总产值中，属于生活资料的产品占60％，其中又以小商品占绝大多数。
    广州各城市人民公社的管理部门，都把发展小商品生产作为社办工业的一个重要方面。不少人民公社还通过定厂、定品种、定产量的办法，保证小商品生产计划的完成。现在广州市场上供应的鞋钉、鞋码、钮扣、木衣夹、网袋、毛刷、木屐、发夹等小商品，有相当数量是由社办工业生产的。今年1至10月份，全市社办工业供应市场布鞋十三万六千多双，手套五万八千多打，钮扣二十一万多打。
    广州市社办工业在发展小商品生产中，充分利用大厂的边角碎料和废品回收部门的废旧料。清平公社五金厂今年1至10月就利用国营五金厂的边角碎料生产了一百五十七万双鞋码。文昌公社橡胶厂利用废旧车轮胎每月加工胶鞋底六千多双、屐皮一万二千多双。
    据新华社郑州电　河南省开封市已经组成以城市人民公社社办工业为核心的小商品生产网。全市生产小商品的工厂有四百三十家，产品品种由今年第一季度的一千二百四十六种发展到第三季度的二千一百九十四种。10月份又增加了一百多种新产品。现在，市场上呈现出一派购销两旺、花色品种丰富多采的繁荣景象。
    开封市的一些小商品生产，有悠久的历史传统。为保持和发展这些产品的生产，这个市的工商部门密切协作，开展了小商品生产的“传宗接代”运动。除著名的剪刀、菜刀、头纱、汴绸继续生产以外，新近又发展了肥皂、香皂、搪瓷产品和复写纸等的生产。这些产品花样新颖、成本低廉、质量很好。由于小商品生产的发展，已经使过去“大产品靠津沪、小商品靠苏杭”供应的局面起了很大变化。现在这个市生产的许多小商品，已经做到自给有余，有四百多种产品还销到郑州、洛阳、鹤壁等地。
