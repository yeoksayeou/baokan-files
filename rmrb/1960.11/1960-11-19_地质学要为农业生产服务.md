    Geology Should Serve Agricultural Production
    Shi Gong
    The role of geology in the development of industry is well known, and geological workers often proudly call themselves "vanguards of industrial construction." But what role does geology play in the development of agriculture? This is a new topic.
    Agricultural production is an important aspect of people transforming nature, especially transforming the Earth. To transform the Earth, one must of course deal with the land and encounter the laws of the Earth's development and changes. We are consciously or unconsciously using these laws to transform nature, otherwise we will make mistakes; and geology is precisely the study of these laws. Therefore, geology should have a great role to play in agricultural production. From the current situation, geology serves agricultural production mainly in the following aspects.
    Serving Water Conservancy and Irrigation
    Water is the lifeblood of crops, but many parts of China often suffer from water and drought imbalances. According to records, from 1766 BC to 1937 AD, there were a total of 2,132 floods and droughts. As Marx said: "Climatic and soil conditions... make the use of canals and irrigation works the basis of Oriental agriculture." ("British Rule in India," "Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol. 2, p. 324) This is also the case in our country, and water conservancy has become a major task of agriculture.
    To build water conservancy, there must be water. The reserves of groundwater are much richer than surface water, and it is continuous throughout the year and relatively reliable. According to archaeologists, the villages of the Stone Age in our country were mostly close to rivers, and it was not until more than 4,000 years ago that they spread to the plains and formed cities. The discovery of methods to use groundwater is an important reason for this change. Until now, groundwater is still an important source of water. To develop groundwater, it is necessary to understand the underground situation, and understand the distribution and activity laws of groundwater, which is precisely the task of geology.
    With water, it is necessary to store water for future use. In some parts of China, there are many mountains and steep slopes. If water is not stored, it is easy to flood when water comes, and easy to drought when water goes. Therefore, a large number of reservoirs and ponds need to be built. Water is stored on the ground. Where is the most suitable place to store it? This requires considering the geological situation. For example, does the rock that makes up the bottom of the reservoir leak water? Is the foundation of the dam strong? Only by finding out the details of these factors can we determine where the reservoir is better to build.
    With water, it must be distributed reasonably, which requires the construction of many water diversion projects. In water diversion projects, it is always necessary to break ground, chisel rocks, and open mountains, which requires understanding the geological conditions, choosing a relatively easy route for construction, and preventing accidents such as channel leakage and collapse.
    After the water reaches the fields, there are still geological problems in how to use the water. If too little water is poured, the crops will not grow well, and if too much water is poured, the groundwater level will rise. Due to the capillary action of soil pores, like a lamp wick absorbing oil, the groundwater source will be continuously sucked to the ground. If the ground climate is dry and evaporation is very severe, the water will continue to run away, and the salt dissolved in the water underground will remain, which will cause the soil to salinize. Such things have happened in some places during the process of reclamation. Therefore, we must also study geology and the groundwater situation when using water.
    In addition, how to improve drilling technology to make drilling faster and cheaper is also an issue that geological departments should pay attention to.
    Serving the Mineral Resources Needed for Agriculture
    There are many minerals that are directly related to agriculture, the most prominent of which are minerals for manufacturing fertilizers, such as phosphate rock, potash salt, peat, saltpeter, etc., which are important sources of fertilizer; sulfur, pyrite, etc. can be used to manufacture sulfuric acid, and sulfuric acid is also a raw material for chemical fertilizers.
    Limestone burned with limestone, as well as clay and sand, etc., are used to improve the soil, and these are all mineral resources.
    The manufacture of pesticides requires mineral raw materials such as chalcanthite and fluorite.
    There are many minerals that can be directly used in agricultural production. The role of many minerals in agricultural production remains to be discovered. After the establishment of commune-run industries, many small-scale mineral deposits have also become urgently needed; rural construction also requires mineral deposits as building materials. As for the power resources such as coal and natural gas that can be used locally, they are even more urgently needed by agriculture.
    It is the undeniable task of geology to find the above-mentioned minerals for agriculture.
    Serving to Improve the Natural Conditions for Agricultural Production
    The object of agricultural production is living organisms, which are greatly affected by various natural conditions. Therefore, for a long time, people have had to "rely on the sky for food" to a large extent. The attack of wind and sand, the erosion of floods, the overflow of rivers, etc., are collectively referred to as geological processes in geology, which cause changes in the earth. Obviously, various geological processes directly affect agricultural production.
    For example, soil erosion caused by geological processes such as wind and flowing water is a serious threat to agricultural production in our country. The fertilizer lost due to soil erosion every year is more than the chemical fertilizer applied in the country. In some places, gullies account for one-third of the total land area. The desert, mainly caused by wind geological processes, has an area in our country close to the total cultivated land, and before liberation it was still expanding. Many places were threatened by quicksand, and cultivated land and gardens were destroyed by it. After active management since liberation, the situation has changed greatly, but the struggle against the desert is still an important task facing these areas.
    The geological action of rivers and lakes also has a clear impact on agriculture. The Yellow River and the Huai River were both famous "harmful rivers" before liberation. We still have many swamps that need to be drained and many saline-alkali lands that need to be improved. There are many other tasks to transform nature, and geological laws need to be applied in these struggles. Here, geology has become an important weapon.
    In the past, there was a thought that the geological problems required to be solved in agricultural production are always very ordinary and common, and the scale of minerals required for agriculture is generally not large, so there is no need for profound geological science and technology. This idea is of course wrong. First of all, it is an extremely glorious task for geology to serve agriculture. At the same time, the geological problems in agricultural production are not easy to solve. Of course, for thousands of years in the past, no geological workers went to the countryside, and farmers still carried out production as usual, but this does not mean that geology is not important in agriculture. On the contrary, it is precisely because the masses of farmers have applied geological laws in many places that they have achieved success. Today, if we can sum up and improve the practical experience of the masses on the one hand, and arm the masses with advanced science and technology on the other hand, we can better promote the development of agricultural production.
    Take well drilling as an example. To make the well drilled in the right place and just right, there are many problems that need to be solved. If too few wells are drilled or the well diameter is too small, the water output will be small, but if too many or too large wells are drilled, the water output will also decrease. Some rock formations simply cannot have water. The search for minerals needed for agriculture is also not simple. The reason why it seemed simple in the past was because there was little research and we didn't go deep into it. There is salt in the salt lake, and it seems simpler than finding underground metal mines, but it is not easy to understand the distribution law of salt. Many small mineral deposits also have their own characteristics, and there are many laws that we need to understand.
    Many of the geological problems that need to be solved in agriculture are how to use geological laws to transform nature, which is precisely a particularly weak link in past geology. In the past geology, there was more description of geological processes and less explanation of how human beings can actively use them to transform the world. For example, in geology, when talking about weathering, only some genetic principles are mentioned. What can we use weathering to do? Nothing. After liberation, farmers in our country have done a lot of work in this regard. The success of afforestation on stone mountains in many places is precisely due to the use of this law. Winter irrigation can make the soil loose, which is also due to the effect of the law that the volume of water expands when it freezes into ice and can produce destructive power.
    For another example, in geology books, when talking about the scouring effect of flowing water, only its harm is mentioned, but the people of northern Shaanxi use this principle to divert water to attack sand, and use the scouring force of flowing water to open up canals, and transform nature with natural forces.
    Geology books also mention that landslides caused by earthquakes can block rivers and form lakes. What can we get from this? But it is not mentioned. Now people are considering in combination with water conservancy construction that since the natural collapsed and accumulated dams of sand and stone can last for a long time and create lakes, can we use similar methods to build reservoirs? This is a major scientific issue, and it is only a concept at present. If it is solved, it will play a major role in water conservancy.
    The accumulation of human's earliest geological knowledge was mainly obtained from agricultural activities and served agriculture. For example, the knowledge of soil, rock, and weathering was established in cultivation, the use of groundwater, and the excavation of canals. "Yu Gong" was written on the basis of the development of agricultural production. The discovery of paleontological fossils was also obtained in the excavation of canals. Even the initial purpose of mineral exploration was mainly for the manufacture of agricultural tools. Therefore, agricultural production is one of the foundations for the development of geological science, and under today's conditions, it will more powerfully promote the development of geology. The application of geological laws often requires a long time and a huge scale. Only under the socialist system, when the people are organized and formed into a whole to fight against nature, can geology be widely used. We must strengthen subjective efforts, arm the masses with geological science, continuously summarize and improve the experience of applying geology in agricultural production, combine geology with the vast majority of peasants in our country, show great talent in the vast world of agriculture, and greatly improve the level of geology.

    地质学要为农业生产服务
    石工
    地质学在发展工业中的作用是人所熟知的，地质工作者常以被称为“工业建设的尖兵”而自豪。但是地质学在发展农业中有什么作用呢？这是一个新的课题。
    农业生产活动是人们改造自然特别是改造地球的一个重要方面。要改造地球，当然得和大地打交道，当然要碰到地球发展变化的规律。我们正是自觉或不自觉地利用了这些规律才改造了自然，否则就会造成错误；而地质学正是研究这些规律的。因此，地质学在农业生产中应该是大有用武之地。从目前的情况来看，地质学为农业生产服务主要有以下几个方面。
    为兴修水利和灌溉服务
    水是庄稼的命根子，但是我国许多地方经常水旱失调。据记载，从公元前1766年至1937年，水旱灾共达二千一百三十二次。如马克思所说：“气候和土壤条件……使利用运河和水利工程进行了灌溉成了东方农业的基础。”（《不列颠在印度的统治》，《马克思恩格斯文选》两卷集324页）这在我国也是如此，兴修水利成为农业的要务。
    兴修水利就得有水。地下水的储量比地面水要丰富得多，而且经年不断，比较可靠。据考古学家查明，我国石器时代的村落多迫近江河，到四千多年前才散布平原形成都邑。人们发现了利用地下水的方法，是促成这种变化的重要原因。直到现在，地下水仍然是重要的水源。而要开发地下水，就得了解地下的情况，了解地下水分布、活动的规律，这正是地质学的任务。
    有了水，还得蓄水备用。我国有些地方山多地陡，如不蓄水，水来易涝，水去易旱，因此需要大量兴修水库堰塘。水蓄起来是蓄在地上的，什么地方蓄起来最合适，这就要考虑到地质情况。譬如组成水库底部的岩石漏不漏水？大坝的地基结实不结实？只有探明了这些因素的底细，方能确定水库修在什么地方更好。
    有了水，还得使它分配合理，这就要修许多引水工程。在引水工程中，总是要破土动工，凿石开山，这就需要了解地质情况，选择施工较易的路线，预防渠道漏水、塌方等事故。
    水到田头后，如何用水，仍然有地质问题。水浇少了庄稼生长不好，浇多了会使地下水位升高。由于土壤孔隙的毛细管作用，像灯草吸油一样，会将地下水源源不绝地吸到地面。如果地面气候干燥，蒸发很厉害，水分不断跑了，水在地下溶解的盐分都留了下来，便会使土壤盐碱化。有些地方在开荒过程中，就曾发生过这样的事情。因此用水也要研究地质，研究地下水的情况。
    此外，如何改造钻井技术，使钻井的速度更快，成本更低，也是地质部门应该注意的问题。
    为农业所需矿产资源服务
    有许多矿产是直接与农业有关的，其中最突出的是制造肥料的矿产，如磷矿、钾盐、泥炭、硝石等，都是重要的肥源；硫磺、黄铁矿等能制造硫酸，而硫酸也是化学肥料的原料。
    改良土壤时要用石灰岩烧制的石灰，以及粘土和砂等等，这些都是矿产资源。
    制造农药要用胆矾、萤石等矿物原料。
    可以直接用于农业生产的矿物很多。许多矿物在农业生产中的作用还有待我们去发现。在公社办工业以后，许多小型的矿藏也成为迫切需要的了；农村建筑也需要作为建筑材料的矿藏。至于可以就地利用的煤和天然气等动力资源，更是农业所急需的。
    为农业找寻上述种种矿产，是地质学无可推卸的任务。
    为改善农业生产的自然条件服务
    农业生产的对象是活的生物，受各种自然条件的影响极大，所以长期以来人们不得不在很大程度上“靠天吃饭”。风沙的袭击、洪水的冲刷、河流的泛滥等等，在地质学中把这些引起大地发生变化的作用统称为地质作用。很显然，各种地质作用直接影响着农业生产。
    例如由风、流水等地质作用造成的水土流失是对我国农业生产的严重威胁。每年因土壤流失而损失的肥分，比全国所施化学肥料还要多。有的地方沟壑占到土地总面积的三分之一。主要由风的地质作用造成的沙漠，在我国面积和全部耕地相近，而且解放前还在不断扩展，许多地方受到流沙的威胁，耕地田园被它破坏。解放后经过积极治理，情况已有很大改变，但同沙漠作斗争还是这些地区面临的重要任务。
    河流湖泊的地质作用对农业的影响也是很明显的。黄河、淮河在解放前都是著名的“害河”。我们还有不少沼泽地需要疏干，不少盐碱地需要改良。改造自然的任务在其他方面还有许多，在这些斗争中需要运用地质规律。在这里，地质学成了一项重要的武器。
    过去有一种思想，认为农业生产所要求解决的地质问题总是很普通很平常的，农业所需的矿产规模一般不大，用不着高深的地质科学技术。这种思想当然是错误的。首先，地质学为农业服务是极其光荣的任务。同时农业生产中的地质问题也并不是容易解决的。固然以往几千年中没有地质工作者下乡，农民照常进行了生产，但这并不表明地质学在农业中不重要。恰恰相反，正是由于农民群众在许多地方运用了地质规律，所以才取得了成绩。今天如能一方面将群众的实际经验总结提高，一方面用先进的科学与技术武装群众，就能更好地促进农业生产的发展。
    拿打井来说，要使井打得是地方，打得恰到好处，就有许多问题需要解决。井打少了，井的口径过小了，出水量会少，但井打得过多过大，出水量也会减少。有的岩层根本就不能有水。农业所需矿产的探寻也并不简单。过去所以觉得简单，是因为研究得少，没有钻进去。盐湖里有盐，看起来道理比找寻地下的金属矿简单，但要认识盐的分布规律，并不容易。许多小型矿藏也都各有特点，有许多规律要我们去认识。
    在农业中需要解决的地质问题，很多是如何利用地质规律来改造自然，这正是过去的地质学中特别薄弱的一环。过去的地质学，叙述地质作用多，阐明人类如何能动地用以改造世界少。譬如在地质学中讲风化作用，仅仅讲些成因原理，究竟我们能利用风化作用作点什么呢？没有。解放后我国农民却在这方面做了许多工作。许多地方石山造林成功，正是利用了这一规律，冬灌能使土质疏松，也正是利用了风化作用中水结成冰时体积膨胀能产生破坏力这一规律的作用。
    又如在地质学的书中讲到流水的冲刷作用，仅仅讲到它的害处，但陕北人民利用了这一原理，引水攻沙，利用流水的冲刷力来开辟运河，以自然力改造自然。
    在地质学的书中还讲到地震造成的山崩，可以堵塞河流形成湖泊。究竟我们从中能得到些什么呢？却没有讲。现在人们结合兴修水利考虑到，既然沙石天然崩塌堆积的堤坝可以经久不溃，造成湖泊，那么我们兴修水库是否可以采用类似的方法呢？这是一个重大的科学课题，在目前还只是一种设想，如果得到解决将对水利事业起着重大作用。
    人类最初的地质知识的积累，便是主要从农业活动中得到，并服务于农业的。如在耕种、利用地下水、开凿运河中建立了对土壤、岩石、风化作用等许多方面的认识的，《禹贡》就是在农业生产得以发展的基础上写出来的。古生物化石的发现，也都是在开凿运河中得到的。即使是找矿，最初也主要是为了制造农具。因此农业生产是地质科学发展的基础之一，在今天的条件下将更有力地推动地质学的发展。地质规律的运用，往往要求较长的时间、巨大的规模。只有在社会主义制度下，在人民组织起来结成整体向自然斗争的时候，地质学才有可能得到广泛运用。我们必须加强主观努力，使群众得到地质科学的武装，不断总结和提高在农业生产中运用地质学的经验，使地质学与我国人口中最大多数的农民群众结合起来，在农业的广阔天地中大显身手，并使地质学的水平大大提高。
