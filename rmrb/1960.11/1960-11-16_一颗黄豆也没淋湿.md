    In the Season of Procurement

    Not a Single Soybean Got Wet
    One evening in late October, members of the Zhangzhong Production Team of the Wanglou Brigade of the Fulili Commune in Su County, Anhui Province, were pulling 1,800 jin of soybeans to the grain station for sale.
    On the way, it suddenly started to rain. Communist Youth League Secretary Li Benchun thought, "We must not allow the state's grain to suffer any loss." He first took off his cotton-padded coat and covered the cart. Then, young women like Fang Tingying also took off their cotton clothes to cover the beans. By the time they arrived at their destination, although their clothes were all soaked, not a single of the 1,800 jin of soybeans had been rained on. Su Tong

    一颗黄豆也没淋湿
    10月底的一个傍晚，安徽宿县苻离公社王楼大队张中生产队的社员们拉着一千八百斤黄豆，送到粮站去交售。
    半路上，忽然下起雨来。团支书李本春想：不能让国家的粮食受到损失。他首先脱下自己的棉袄盖在车上，接着女青年芳廷英等也把自己的棉衣脱下来盖住豆子。当他们到达目的地的时候，虽然衣服都淋湿了，但是一千八百斤黄豆一颗也没有遭到雨淋。宿通
