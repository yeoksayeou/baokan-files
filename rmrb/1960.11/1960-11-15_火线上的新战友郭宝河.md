    New Comrade-in-Arms on the Front Lines
    Guo Baohe
    After transferring out of the Dabie Mountains, we fought many victorious battles, the liberated areas expanded, and the army was supplemented with many new soldiers.

    We were stationed in Ye County, Henan for rest and reorganization. One day, Instructor Li Jia'ao called me in and said, "Our company has established a new machine gun squad, and the leadership wants you to be the deputy squad leader."

    I was taken aback. I had only been in the army for a little over a year, and I hadn't been a machine gunner for long. Leading a machine gun might be okay, but leading a whole squad might be too much for me. Then the instructor continued:
   "The squad has five people including you, two newly enlisted soldiers, and two who were incorporated into the army during the Yangshan battle. Liu Bingguo is also in your squad, how about it?"

    What could I say? The organization was trusting me by putting me in charge. I said to the instructor, "Okay, I'll follow the organization's decision." But I really wasn't confident. Most of the squad were liberated soldiers and newly enlisted soldiers, how was I going to lead them?

    It was called a machine gun squad, but there wasn't even a shadow of a machine gun. On the day of departure after the troops' rest and reorganization, the company notified us that we would be issued a Maxim heavy machine gun and that we should go and carry it. I was overjoyed when I heard this. I pulled Liu Bingguo over there and took a look, and my heart sank again. What kind of gun was this! The barrel must have been hit by a shell, crooked and missing pieces. Carrying it was like having a "deaf man's ear"! Song Wenyi, who had just joined the army, didn't know the difference between a good gun and a bad gun. He stroked the barrel with both hands and said happily, "Our squad has a gun now, it won't be a problem to fight the 'doomed army' this time. Squad leader, don't you think so?"

    I was full of displeasure and ignored him, only saying to Liu Bingguo, "Let's go, carry the gun back!" I turned to find the instructor.

    The instructor was in the company headquarters, head down, writing something. I went in and said, "Instructor, I'm not doing it anymore!" He smiled and looked at me, asking, "What's wrong, who are you angry with now!"
      "The men are those kinds of men, the gun is a broken-down gun, I can't do it."
      "What kind of men are you talking about? New recruits, liberated soldiers, is that right?"

    He put down his pen, stood up, and walked up to me, asking, "Guo Baohe, I ask you, how did you grow up? Were you born a People's Liberation Army soldier? Were you born knowing revolutionary principles?"

    The words were short, but they left me speechless. Before joining the army, I only knew how to herd sheep and farm the land. It was after joining the army that the Party and comrades opened my eyes and made me realize the revolutionary future. Thinking of this, I felt I was too rash and rubbed my hands embarrassedly, saying, "I'll do it, but..."

    "But you want to change the gun, right?" The instructor's stern expression softened. Seeing a chance, I quickly said, "Of course, that gun is a first-class cripple, it's really useless."
      "Then it depends on your ability. The army is expanding every day, and we don't have a munitions factory, nor do we have that much money to buy guns. If you want to change guns, won't you go to find 'transportation captain' Chiang Kai-shek? You, you're still an old soldier!"

    My face flushed at the time, and I blamed myself for always reaching out to superiors. Once I understood the idea, I turned to leave, but the instructor stopped me again, saying, "Remember, you are a Communist Party member, you must trust everyone. Whether they are peasant soldiers who have just been liberated, or liberated soldiers, they are all our class brothers. As long as you unite them well and educate them, they will become good soldiers."

    The instructor's words left me speechless. A few days later, the troops were ordered to attack Sucheng. The platoon leader borrowed a gun barrel and replaced our crooked barrel. It worked fine after testing, but it couldn't fire in bursts.

    On the evening of November 13, the troops launched an attack, and we used that single-shot machine gun to cover the troops attacking the station. By dawn the next day, the west, south, and north gates of Sucheng had been captured. We occupied the station, leaving only the east gate in enemy hands.

    During the day, the enemy and we were at a standoff. At night, the battalion ordered us to move our position to cover the Fifth Company's movement towards the east gate through the blockade ditch. On the way, the battalion commander brought a person to me and said, "Guo Baohe, we're supplementing your squad with a new comrade, liberated yesterday."
    "Great, another liberated one." I thought to myself, and sized up the new comrade. He was of medium height, his face was bloodless, and his eyes were dazed as he stood there in a daze. He was already thin, and with his dirty and unsightly Kuomintang military uniform, he looked even more slovenly. I asked him, "What's your name?"
      "Song Jiurong." He lowered his head, avoiding my gaze, and replied timidly.

    The battle was about to begin again, and I didn't have time to talk to him much, so I pointed to Liu Bingguo and said, "Song Jiurong, this is your group leader, stay with him!" Liu Bingguo warmly pulled him to his side.

    The battle started, and everyone was busy loading bullets and getting water. Only Song Jiurong stood aside, preoccupied, moving slowly. Only when enemy shells came over did he calmly and nimbly dodge them.

    What was he thinking? We really had to pay attention, or he might "grease his soles" and slip away! I thought to myself.

    After fighting for a while, the troops advanced. When passing through the blockade ditch, the whole squad had passed, but Song Jiurong was nowhere to be seen. I quickly jumped back to take a look, and he was crawling in the ditch! It seemed that my worry just now was justified. I grabbed his arm and said gently, "Hurry up, the comrades in the squad are waiting for us."

    He reluctantly followed me. To be honest, I was a little resentful of the battalion commander for sending us a burden when the battle was so tense!

    The battle developed smoothly, and we occupied Xiaodongguan. After the enemy's several counterattacks were repelled, they became like deflated balls, half-dead and throwing random shots, as if ringing their own death knell. We took advantage of the break in the battle to rest against the wall facing the sun. Everyone was talking and laughing, discussing the battle just now. Song Jiurong, on the other hand, sat alone in a corner facing away from the sun, silently pondering something with a worried look on his face. Liu Bingguo asked him:
    "Song Jiurong, what's wrong with you? What's on your mind?"
    Song Jiurong looked up, but didn't say a word.
      "If you have difficulties, just say it, don't always be like this," other comrades in the squad said.

    He still didn't say anything, constantly rubbing his left foot with his hand. Only then did I notice that he wasn't wearing shoes. No wonder he fell behind! Look, what was I thinking just now! I was ashamed for a moment and asked:
    "Where are your shoes?"
      "Lost them."
    "Why didn't you say so earlier?" Liu Bingguo put down his gun, wiped his hands with oilcloth, opened his satchel, and took out a pair of new cloth shoes: "Quick, take them and put them on."
      "This..." Song Jiurong stared blankly, not daring to take the shoes.

    "Put them on, rely on your parents at home, rely on your comrades in the army. Your group leader is also careless, I didn't know you were barefoot, you must have frozen your feet, right?"

    Song Jiurong hesitated, took the shoes, and then looked at me again. I said, "Put them on, that's how our People's Liberation Army is, comrades are like brothers."

    Tears welled up in his eyes, and he said to Liu Bingguo:
  "Group leader, I will definitely live up to you."
    "Hey, where did that come from, revolutionary comrades, unity and mutual assistance! When I first came here, the old comrades treated me the same way!"
    "You also came from over there?"
    "Of course, I was liberated during the Yangshan campaign last year."
      "Unexpected... couldn't tell..." Song Jiurong stammered, unable to continue, just looking up and down at Liu Bingguo, then looking around at the comrades, the corners of his mouth twitched, as if he wanted to smile, but his eyes were filled with tears. He was no longer so worried, and began to talk about his family with the comrades. It turned out that his family were tenant farmers, and because they couldn't pay the landlord's rent, he became a soldier for the landlord's son. In the Kuomintang reactionary army, although he suffered hunger, cold, and humiliation, he didn't dare to desert. Because he saw with his own eyes one of his fellow villagers who deserted and was caught and shot. As he spoke, he was already sobbing, his thin shoulders twitching up and down.

    Some of the comrades in the squad were also liberated soldiers, and they all had a painful experience in the Kuomintang army. Song Jiurong's narration evoked past events, and everyone's eyes turned red.

    "Comrades, today we are all revolutionary soldiers, we must avenge the poor and fight for the world!" I told him what the instructor had told me when I first joined the army: "There are thousands upon thousands of suffering people like us across the country who are being oppressed and tortured by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and we must liberate them."

    Song Jiurong didn't say anything, but in his eyes, which were filled with radiance, a firm expression was revealed.

    It was dark again, the sound of gunfire was getting tighter and tighter, and friendly units had already broken into the city. We also opened a breakthrough, and rushed into the city one by one like little tigers. Song Jiurong carried more than seven hundred rounds of ammunition on his back, sweating all over, and followed closely behind Liu Bingguo without missing a step. When others wanted to replace him, he grabbed the ammunition box and wouldn't let go, fearing that it would be snatched away.

    Not far into the city, the battalion commander ordered us to stay and guard the motor pool, not to be paralyzed, and to be careful of fleeing enemies.

    I told Liu Bingguo to set up the gun at the gate, and the rest of the comrades went inside to count the things. Goodness, more than thirty trucks, fully loaded with military supplies. It seemed that the enemy had just loaded the trucks and hadn't had time to drive away when we intercepted them.

    We were busy when we suddenly heard the sound of machine guns "da da da" from the west, mixed with the dull sound of motorcycles. At this time, someone shouted, "Armored car!"

    I looked outside, and sure enough, one, two,... a whole seven! The black things were driving straight towards us. The motors shook the ground, and the machine guns on the cars spat out tongues of fire, scattering the dirt clods on the walls everywhere.

    I whispered to everyone, "Stay calm, let them get closer, and catch them off guard." To be honest, I had never seen this thing in the year or so since I joined the army. Especially with that machine gun that didn't fire in bursts, could we deal with it? I couldn't help but feel a little nervous. At this time, I saw Liu Bingguo holding the machine gun firmly, staring intently at the enemy. Seeing that the enemy was about to reach us, he calmly pressed the trigger. With a "puff" sound, the tire of the car in front was hit, the car tilted forward, and was paralyzed in place. Now the enemy directed all their firepower at us, and the flashing bullets flew over our heads, smashing the door frame to pieces. Liu Bingguo's machine gun was suppressed, and the situation was very critical, we had to counterattack immediately. Before I could issue an order, Song Jiurong swooshed out, throwing two grenades at random. Two balls of fire flashed in the car group. We also took the opportunity to pounce on them. Seeing that the situation was not good, the cars behind turned around and wanted to run, but with a loud bang, they tilted and fell into the ditch, unable to climb out. The comrades in the squad swarmed up, approaching the front of the cars, and the enemy's firepower lost its effect.

    At this time, the pursuing troops arrived, surrounded these "clumsy oxen," and shouted loudly, "Come out quickly! The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners of war leniently!" Song Jiurong jumped onto the car, banging the deck with a grenade: "Brothers, come out quickly, you'll be treated leniently!" There was a chattering discussion in the car, then the door slowly opened, and a white handkerchief was raised.
      "Ah! Should have done this a long time ago!" Song Jiurong said, jumping off the car.

    The enemy who came out with their hands up saw that Song Jiurong was wearing a Kuomintang military uniform and said, "Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding!" and wanted to put their hands down. Song Jiurong said, "No misunderstanding at all, we are the People's Liberation Army!"

    That guy stared blankly, stunned. Seeing Song Jiurong's energetic appearance, I was happy from the bottom of my heart. In just one day, he had changed so quickly!

    At this time, Song Wenyi carried a heavy machine gun out of the car, smiling and saying, "Squad leader, a gun, brand new!"

    In this battle, we captured seven heavy machine guns, more than 40,000 rounds of ammunition, and seven armored cars. Chiang Kai-shek, the "transportation captain," sent us a lot of equipment again.

    The troops went through another short period of rest and reorganization. One day, the instructor called me again and asked:
    "How is it?"
    "Everyone is great," I replied happily.
    "Now we want to transfer Liu Bingguo and Song Jiurong from your squad to other squads, do you have any objections?"
    "How can this be? We just got familiar, and they fight well too..."
    "Isn't it good for them to lead more new comrades?"
    "Then what about our squad?"
    "We'll supplement it with three new comrades, just liberated."
    Three more liberated ones! But this time I didn't hesitate at all, and answered loudly:
  "Instructor, I obey the organization's decision!"

    The instructor laughed heartily, patted me on the shoulder and said, "That's right. Remember that our army grew from nothing to something, from small to large!"

    Soon, I led another group of new comrades to participate in the Huaihai Campaign, which had already begun.

    火线上的新战友
    郭宝河
    由大别山转移出来，打了许多胜仗，解放区扩大了，部队补充了许多新战士。
    我们住在河南叶县休整。一天，指导员李家鳌同志把我找去，对我说：“咱连又成立了一个机枪班，领导上叫你去当副班长。”
    我听了心里一跳。参军才一年多，当机枪射手也没多久，叫我指挥一挺机枪也许还行，指挥一个班恐怕担不起。只听指导员接着说：
  “全班连你五个人，两个新参军的，两个是从羊山战斗时解放入伍的。刘炳国也在你们班，怎么样？”
    我说什么呢？组织叫我负责是对我的信任。我向指导员说：“行啊，我服从组织决定。”可是心里实在没底，班里大部分是解放战士和新参军的战士，怎么来领导他们呢？
    说是机枪班，可连个机枪影子都没有。部队休整后临出发那天，连里来通知，说发给我们一挺马克沁重机枪，要我们去扛。我一听，高兴极了，拉着刘炳国到那里一看，心又凉了半截，这叫啥枪啊！枪管准是吃过炮弹，歪脖缺嘴的。扛着它还不是“聋子的耳朵”！新参军的宋文义不懂得好枪孬枪，双手抚摸着枪管，欢天喜地地说：“我们班有枪了，这回打‘遭殃军’不成问题了。班长，你说是不是？”
    我满肚子不高兴，没理他，只对刘炳国说：“走，把枪扛回去！”转身去找指导员。
    指导员在连部里正低头写什么，我进门就说：“指导员，我不干了！”他笑着看看我问：“怎么的，又和谁憋气了！”
      “人是那号子人，枪是蹩脚枪，我干不了。”
      “你说的那号子人？新兵，解放战士，是吗？”
    他放下笔站起来走到我面前，问我：“郭宝河，我问你，你是怎么长大的？你生下来就是解放军战士吗？生下来就懂得革命道理吗？”
    话虽然短，可问得我张口结舌。我参军前只晓得放羊、种地，是参军后党和同志们擦亮了我的眼睛，使我认清了革命前途。想到这里，感到自己太莽撞了，不好意思地搓着手说：“干是干，不过……”
    “不过那枪要换换，对吗？”指导员严峻的神色缓和下来。我看有门儿，急忙说道：“可不，那枪是一等老残废，实在不中用。”
      “那就看你们的本事了。部队天天扩大，咱又没有兵工厂，也没这多钱买枪。要换枪，你不会去找
  ‘运输大队长’蒋介石？你呀，还是老兵呢！”
    我当时红了脸，埋怨自己老会向上级伸手。思想一通，转身要走，指导员又叫住我：“记住，你是一个共产党员，要相信大家，不论是刚翻身的农民战士，还是解放战士，都是我们的阶级兄弟，只要很好地团结他们，教育他们，会成为好战士的。”
    指导员的几句话说得我真是哑口无言了。不几天，部队奉命去打宿县城。排长借个枪管来，换下我们那个歪枪筒。试了试还行，就是不能打连发。
    11月13日晚上，部队发起进攻，我们就用那打单发的机枪，掩护部队攻打车站。次日天亮，宿县城西、南、北三关都被攻下来了，我们占领了车站，就剩下东关还在敌人手里。
    白天，敌我对峙。晚上，营里命令我们转移阵地，掩护五连通过封锁沟向东关移动。走在路上，营长带上一个人对我说：“郭宝河，给你们班补充一个新同志，昨晚解放过来的。”
    “得，又是解放的。”我心里想着，把新来的同志上下打量一番。他中等身材，脸无血色，两眼失神地站在那里发呆。他本来就瘦，加上一身肮脏不堪的国民党军衣，更显得邋邋遢遢。我问他：“你叫什么名字？”
      “宋九荣。”他搭拉着脑袋，回避着我的目光，怯生生地回答。
    战斗又要开始了，我没时间和他多谈，就指指刘炳国说：“宋九荣，这是你的组长，跟他在一起吧！”刘炳国亲热地把他拉到身边。
    战斗打响了，大伙在紧张地装子弹、打水。独有宋九荣站在一旁，心事重重，动作迟缓，只有敌人炮弹打过来的时候，他才不慌不忙，机灵地躲避一下。
    他想什么呢？真得注意点，要不，他可能“脚底抹油”溜掉呢！我心里想。
    打了一会，部队向前延伸，通过封锁沟的时候，全班都过去了，就是不见宋九荣。我赶忙跳回去一看，他正在沟里爬着呢！看来，我刚才耽心是有道理的。我挽住他的胳膊，温和地说：“快点，班里同志等着咱们呢。”
    他勉勉强强地跟我走着。说实话，我心里有点埋怨营长，战斗这样紧张，给我们送来个累赘！
    战斗发展得很顺利，我们占领了小东关。敌人几次反扑被打下去之后，就成了泄气的皮球，半死不活的东一下西一下乱打炮，像给自己敲丧钟。我们趁战斗空隙对着朝阳靠墙根休息，大家说说笑笑，谈论刚才的战斗。宋九荣呢，一个人坐在背阳的角落里一声不吭，愁眉苦脸不知在盘算什么。刘炳国问他：
    “宋九荣，你是咋搞的？有什么心事？”
    宋九荣抬头望望，没有吭声。
      “有困难就说嘛，别老这样。”班里别的同志也说。
    他还不言语，不时用手揉着左脚。这时我才发现，他脚上没穿鞋子，怪不得掉队呢！看，我刚才想哪去了！我一阵惭愧，问道：
    “你的鞋呢？”
      “丢了。”
    “那你不早说。”刘炳国放下枪，用油布擦擦手，解开挂包，掏出一双新布鞋：“快拿去穿上。”
      “这……”宋九荣不解地瞪着眼睛，不敢接鞋。
    “穿上吧，在家靠父母，到部队靠同志，我这个组长也粗心，不知道你打赤脚，把脚冻坏了吧？”
    宋九荣迟疑地接过鞋去，又转看看我。我说：“穿吧，咱人民解放军就是这样，同志就是亲兄弟。”
    他眼角流下泪水，对刘炳国说：
  “组长，我一定对得起你。”
    “哎，说到哪里去了，革命同志，团结互助嘛！我刚过来那阵，老同志也是这样待我的！”
    “你也是那边过来的？”
    “可不，我是去年羊山战役解放过来的。”
      “想不到……看不出来……”宋九荣结结巴巴说不下去了，只是上下打量着刘炳国，然后环视周围的同志，嘴角一动，像是要笑，但眼里含着泪花。他再不那么愁眉苦脸了，开始跟同志们谈起家常来。原来他家是佃户，因欠地主的租子没法还，便替地主儿子当了兵。在国民党反动派军队里，虽然受尽了饥寒和屈辱，却不敢开小差。因为他亲眼看到自己的一个同乡，开小差被抓回枪毙了。说着说着，他已泣不成声，精瘦的肩膀上下抽搐着。
    班里同志有的也是解放战士，在国民党军队里都有一段辛酸经历，宋九荣的叙述，勾起了往事，大家眼圈都红了。
    “同志们，今天咱们都是革命战士，要为穷苦人报仇，打天下！”我把刚参军时指导员对我说过的话告诉他：“全国还有千千万万我们这样的受苦人，在受国民党反动派的压迫折磨，我们要去解放他们。”
    宋九荣没有说什么，但从他那双充满了光辉的眼里，流露出坚毅的神情。
    天又黑了，枪声越来越紧，友邻部队已经突入城内。我们也打开了个突破口，一个个像小老虎似地往城里冲，宋九荣背着七百多发子弹，累得满身汗水，一步不拉地紧跟在刘炳国后面，别人要换他，他抓着子弹箱不放，唯恐被人抢去。
    进城不远，营长吩咐我们留下看守车场，不要麻痹，留心溃散的敌人。
    我叫刘炳国把枪架在门口，其余的同志到里面去清点东西。乖乖，三十多辆大卡车，满装军用物资，看来敌人刚装好车没来得及开走，就被我们截住了。
    我们正忙着，忽听西边响起“哒哒哒”的机枪声，还夹杂着沉闷的摩托声。这时有人喊道：“装甲车！”
    我向外一看，可不是，一辆、二辆、……整整七辆！黑家伙直向我们驶来。马达震得地皮直忽扇，车上机枪喷着火舌，打得墙上的土块，四处乱飞。
    我小声对大家说：“沉住气，放近点，打他个措手不及。”说实话，参军一年多，我还没见过这玩艺，特别是那挺不连发的机枪能对付得了吗？心里不免有点紧张。这时，只见刘炳国牢牢地拿着机枪，紧紧盯着敌人，眼看敌人要到跟前了，他不慌不忙压下扳机，只听“噗哧”一声，前面一辆车的轮胎被打坏了，车向前一倾，瘫痪在原地不动了。这下子敌人把所有火力向我们射击，闪光的子弹从头上飞过，把门框打得稀烂，刘炳国的机枪被压住了，情况很危急，必须立刻还击。没等我发出命令，宋九荣嗖的一下穿出去，随手甩出两颗手榴弹。车群里闪出两团火光。我们也趁势扑了上去，敌人见势不妙，后面的几辆车掉头想跑，轰隆一声，歪倒沟里爬不上来了。班里同志一拥而上，靠近车前，敌人的火力失去了作用。
    这时，追击的部队赶到，把这些“笨牛”团团围住，大声喊着：“快出来！解放军优待俘虏！”宋九荣纵身跳到车上，用手榴弹把甲板擂得当当直响：“兄弟们，快出来吧，出来宽待！”车里叽叽喳喳嘀咕一阵，接着车门慢慢打开，举出一条白手帕。
      “唉！早就该这样！”宋九荣说着从车上跳下来。
    举手出来的敌人，看宋九荣身上穿的是国民党军装，连说：“误会！误会！”要把手放下来。宋九荣说：“一点没误会，我们是人民解放军！”
    那家伙瞪着眼睛楞住了。瞧着宋九荣那生龙活虎的劲头，我从心里高兴。才一天工夫，他变得多快呀！
    这时宋文义从车里扛出一挺重机枪，笑容满面地说：“班长，枪，崭新的！”
    这一仗，我们缴获重机枪七挺，弹药四万余发，装甲车七辆，蒋介石这个“运输大队长”又给我们送来不少装备。
    部队又进行短期休整。有一天，指导员又把我叫去，问道：
    “怎么样？”
    “个个都是好样的。”我愉快地回答。
    “现在要把你们班的刘炳国、宋九荣调到其他班去，有意见吗？”
    “这怎么行？刚搞熟，打仗也不错……。”
    “他们去带更多的新同志，不好吗？”
    “那我们班呢？”
    “另补充三个新同志，才解放过来的。”
    又是三个解放过来的！但是这回我却没有丝毫犹豫，大声回答：
  “指导员，服从组织决定！”
    指导员爽朗地笑了，拍着我的肩膀说：“这就对了。要记住我们的部队就是这样从无到有，从小到大的啊！”
    不久，我又带领另一伙新战友，去参加已揭开序幕的淮海战役。
