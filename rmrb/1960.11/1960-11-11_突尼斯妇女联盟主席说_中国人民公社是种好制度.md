    Tunisian Women's League President Says
    People's Communes in China Are a Good System
    Mrs. Aradia Haddad,团长 of the Tunisian National Women's League and a member of the Tunisian New Constitution Party delegation that recently visited China, said on November 4th while meeting with the women members of the Chinese Exhibition Group participating in the 8th Tunisian International Fair: "What impressed me most was the Chinese people's self-confidence and confidence in the future." She said, "I am very satisfied with my visit to China, and I have beautiful memories of China. I know that China once suffered the same hardships as Tunisia, the Chinese people suffered, and millions of Chinese people died of hunger. But China has undergone fundamental changes today. Unemployment has been eliminated, and everyone is working. I saw with my own eyes in China: everyone is living well, full of energy, and healthy."
    Talking about people's communes, Mrs. Haddad said that based on her observations in China, she believes that people's communes are a good system. She said: "Some people say that this system breaks up families, which is not true. What I saw was that in China, families are not only not broken up, but are living well. People work during the day and reunite with their families in the evening. In the old China, due to poverty, fathers were forced to sell their sons and daughters, and even sell their wives, and families were broken up." Finally, she expressed her admiration for the Chinese people's diligent work.

    突尼斯妇女联盟主席说
    中国人民公社是种好制度
    最近访问中国归来的突尼斯新宪政党代表团团员、突尼斯全国妇女联盟主席阿拉迪阿·哈达德夫人，11月4日在接见参加第八届突尼斯国际博览会中国展览团的妇女团员们时说：“使我感受最深的，是中国人民的自信和对前途的信心。”她说：“我对我的访问中国之行感到非常满意，我对中国保持着美好的回忆。我知道，中国曾经遭受过和突尼斯一样的苦难，中国人民曾经受苦受难，数以百万计的中国人曾经因饥饿而死。但是，中国今天已经发生了根本的变化。失业消灭了，人人都在工作。我在中国亲眼看到：人人都生活得很好，精神饱满、身体健康。”
    谈到人民公社，哈达德夫人说：根据她在中国的观察，她认为人民公社是一种好制度。她说：“有人说什么这种制度拆散了家庭，这是不真实的。我所见到的是，在中国，家庭不仅没有拆散，而是生活得很好。人们白天劳动，晚上一家团聚。而在旧中国，由于贫困，父亲被迫卖儿鬻女，甚至出卖妻子，家庭被拆散。”最后她对中国人民的勤恳劳动表示钦佩。
