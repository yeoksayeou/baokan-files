    A Small Village by the Si River
    Liu Aidu
    After the train came to a stop at the Dongzhen Station in Wenxi, I jumped off first and headed towards Yangjiayuan Village, taking two steps at a time. Yangjiayuan is located west of the Si River and east of the Southern Mountains. It is a small village with only fifty or so households and a population of just over a hundred. I worked as a primary school teacher in this village for nearly three years, and I have deeply fallen in love with this place. The land in this village is a flat expanse of good soil, but almost all of it is dry land. The clear river water flows in a deep riverbed beside the village, but people can only dig a few "river-connecting wells" beside the river and use a windlass to irrigate a limited few acres of land. Once a drought occurs, the Si River dries up. People need to expend a great deal of effort to dig deep into the riverbed to find a pool of muddy water. Therefore, people also call the Si River the "Repair River." But what use are a few buckets of "repaired" muddy water? The land is still scorched dry by the scorching sun, with cracks as wide as four fingers. According to the elderly, in ordinary years before liberation, one mu of land would yield "at most one dou, at least three sheng" of wheat. Wei Xinfa, an elderly man nearing eighty, told me that in the third year of the Guangxu reign, there was a severe drought, and more than eighty of the village's one hundred or so people starved to death. More than thirty families were wiped out. In the cave dwelling of a family who had fled the famine and starved to death, seven sets of human bones were unearthed. At that time, the drought was so severe, and the floods were the same. After liberation, the ability to resist natural disasters has been greatly strengthened, but the situation of being affected by disasters has not been completely changed. Take the flood in 1958 as an example. After only one day of heavy rain, the flood rushed down from the upper reaches of the Si River like tens of thousands of fierce lions, with towering waves of muddy water also rolling with uprooted trees and millstones the size of grinding discs.... The flood overflowed the river channel, and half of Yangjiayuan Village was destroyed. If it hadn't been for the newly built dam of the Yangjiayuan Reservoir, the entire village would have been swept away by the flood. In that year, all the crops in the fields were washed away by the flood.
    Not long after the flood, I was transferred away from Yangjiayuan. To be honest, in the year or so since I left Yangjiayuan, I have thought about it almost every day. Especially in this year of rare drought, it made me worry about it even more: "How did the masses get through the severe flood in 1958 and this year's severe drought? What has Yangjiayuan become now?" As I thought about this, my heart was as anxious as if it were on fire, and I wished I had wings to fly to the village in an instant.
    I walked along the familiar field path. But the more I walked, the more I felt something was wrong. The corn on both sides of the road was so tall and dense. Looking inside, hey, many plants had three ears. I couldn't help but be drawn to it. Walking inside, I found that there were even plants with four ears! I stood on tiptoe and stretched out my arms to reach the third ear. "Where have I come to? Could such crops grow in the fields of Yangjiayuan?" I looked around blankly, feeling like I was lost in a big forest.
      "Who's in the cornfield?"
    Through the dense corn leaves, I saw a white-haired old man. He stood majestically on the roadside at the edge of the field, holding a basket in one hand and a crutch in the other. It was none other than old man Wei Xinfa. I hurried over and grabbed the old man's hand: "Uncle Wei, it's you!" He was stunned for a moment, then said, "Who did I think it was? I didn't expect it was you?"
    "This... is this Yangjiayuan's corn?" I asked hesitantly.
      "Yes. -- What, you don't quite believe it? I've lived for so many years, and I've never even heard of such good crops growing in such a dry year. Ah, this year, in the beginning, it scared me a lot..."
    Uncle Wei was a very talkative person. Without even asking if I was in a hurry, he stood at the edge of the field and talked to me in detail. He said that from the beginning of this year, seeing that the sky had not rained for many days, the sky was like fire, the ground was scorched dry, the Si River was at the bottom, and the well was also dry. The reservoir also had only a bottom of water left, and it could not flow out of the canal. The cadres worked hard day and night, leading the villagers to carry water to plant the corn, some of which did not sprout, and those that did sprouted quickly withered. He thought to himself, "We are going to suffer the same as in the third year of Guangxu!" Unexpectedly, at this critical moment, Commissioner Wang and County Magistrate Zheng came with the people from the commune. They worked together to deepen the old "June 1st Canal" and opened a new "June 1st Canal," diverting the water stored in the reservoir to the fields, and also transferred several water pumps and several thousand catties of chemical fertilizer. Commissioner Wang and County Magistrate Zheng personally led the villagers to water and fertilize. After working like this for several months, they finally saved the crops.
      "Ah! If it weren't for the construction of the reservoir, if it weren't for the strength of the People's Commune, if it weren't for Commissioner Wang and County Magistrate Zheng leading the hard work, where would we be today?" I let out a long sigh of relief after listening. Eager to see what the village had become now, I said goodbye to Uncle Wei.
    I walked along the field path for not too long before I climbed onto the dam of the Yangjiayuan Reservoir. The dam was higher, thicker, and more solid than the one built before the flood. The reservoir was full of blue water, rippling in the sunlight, like a reservoir of broken silver. Groups of fat ducks were playing on the water, and several small boats were gently rowing, with people on the boats casting fishing nets. Not far to the west of the reservoir, there were rows of new tile-roofed houses. All around the new tile-roofed houses was corn. Standing on the dam and looking out, the village was like a small island in a vast ocean.
      "Could this be the Yangjiayuan that I was worried about and thinking about all the time?" With a feeling of surprise and doubt, I walked towards the village. From the threshing ground at the entrance of the village came the joyful noise of celebration. The field was full of corn, and the villagers were either stripping corn husks or carefully stacking the husked corn ears. The golden and white corn piles shone brightly in the sunlight. Several elementary school students were the first to spot me and ran towards me with joyful shouts. The villagers also greeted me warmly. I immediately saw Aunt Xiuying in the crowd. She stood up, patted the dirt off her body, and said, "The cafeteria has already had lunch. Come on, let's go to my house and eat." I wanted to decline, but she didn't allow it and pulled me towards her house. At the entrance of the field, I ran into the production team leader, Old Four, who was driving a corn cart back. I shouted, "Brother Old Four, is the corn almost harvested?" He excitedly cracked his whip in the air and replied, "Only forty or so mu have been harvested, there are still more than two hundred mu to go!"
    Aunt Xiuying's house was also washed away by the flood in 1958. Now she lives in a newly built five-room tile-roofed house. In the middle of the courtyard, various chrysanthemums are planted. The house is also spacious, tidy, and bright. On the front wall of the door hangs a portrait of Chairman Mao. I didn't expect her house to become like this. I couldn't help but think of the flood in 1958 again, but before I could ask, she opened her mouth: "Thinking back to that time, it was really worrying. Everything was washed away. The houses that didn't collapse were also leaning to one side or the other. Many old people were preparing to go outside. Do you remember Aunt Gou Xiao? At that time, Uncle Gou Xiao was seriously ill, and Brother Gou Xiao was about to get married. Once the house collapsed, Brother Gou Xiao wouldn't be able to get married either..."
      "How is she now?" I asked eagerly.
      "Now? -- You should go and see her with your own eyes! She's living a very good life," Aunt Xiuying smiled and continued, "At that time, Secretary Zhang was really suffering. During the day, he dug things from under the collapsed houses with the villagers, sweating all over and covered in mud. In the evening, he called the masses together for meetings and went to each household to offer condolences. His eyes were red.
      "Did he live here for a long time?"
      "Of course, the day after you were transferred, he moved his bedding from the township. Since there were no houses to live in, he let the villagers squeeze into the houses that hadn't collapsed, and he set up a thatched shed at the entrance of the village to live in himself. He led everyone to put the soil from the collapsed houses into the fields and helped to prop up the fallen crops. He said, 'We must fight the heavens to the end. If the face of Yangjiayuan doesn't change, I will never leave my fellow villagers.' Secretary Zhang stabilized everyone's hearts, but the disaster was really too great. The damaged reservoir couldn't be repaired immediately, and there was no strength to build houses for a while. Secretary Zhang said, 'It would be easier if the commune was bigger!' Before long, the commune really became bigger, and several townships formed a people's commune. The commune immediately sent more than two thousand people, and the reservoir was repaired in less than a month. They also sent masons and transported bricks, tiles, and timber, and quickly built a large area of new tile-roofed houses. That autumn, it was precisely because Secretary Zhang led everyone to work hard that we were able to harvest grain! Everyone was overjoyed and said, 'Unexpectedly, after suffering a great disaster, we were able to live in new houses and harvest grain!' This exhausted Secretary Zhang and he fell ill. Later, he went to Taiyuan to see a doctor and was transferred away! My fellow villagers and I really miss him!"
    In the evening, I really came to Gou Xiao's house. Gou Xiao's house was no different from Aunt Xiuying's house. Except that the doors and windows were painted black, the windows were covered with snow-white paper, and a square piece of glass was inlaid, with red paper-cut flowers pasted on the glass, making the whole house look even better. Aunt Gou Xiao warmly invited me into the house, saying, "Good, good, everything is good! New tile-roofed house, newly married daughter-in-law... If it had been before, I, an old woman, would have been begging outside if I had encountered years of natural disasters!"
    As she spoke, several young people came in. Among them was a young girl I didn't recognize, who looked quite pretty. As soon as she entered the door, she shouted, "Mom, our shock brigade is going to have a meeting at our house tonight." Aunt Gou Xiao responded while proudly whispering to me, "This is my daughter-in-law..." The new daughter-in-law came over to shake my hand generously and said, "You are Teacher Liu, right? -- I've heard of you. You've been transferred to work in the county, so please give us more guidance in our work!" Her generous words and actions made me feel restrained.
    A burst of footsteps sounded outside the door, and the production team leader Old Four came with the shock brigade members. After a while, the door creaked open again. Old man Wei Xinfa came in, leaning on his crutch. He took out an envelope and several sheets of paper from his pocket, pointed to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall, and said, "Teacher Liu, please help me write a letter to him."
    "Write a letter to Chairman Mao?" The shock brigade members all ran over in surprise.
    I quickly took out a pen and said, "Okay, you tell me and I'll write."
    Uncle Wei stroked his beard and thought for a while, then pointed to the letter paper and said, "First write, 'Chairman Mao, you have led us well, the world is good now, the People's Commune is good, building the reservoir is good, and the cadres he sent are good!'"
      "Then write," Uncle Wei looked at everyone and continued, "Yangjiayuan Village has encountered major disasters every two or three years, but it still produces grain every year, and we have moved into new tile-roofed houses..."
      "And we have married new daughters-in-law! And..." Aunt Gou Xiao interjected seriously.

    洓水河旁一小庄
    刘爱都
    火车在闻喜东镇车站停稳以后，我便抢先跳了下来，三步并做两步地向杨家园村走去。杨家园西临洓水，东望南山，是个只有五十来户、一百多口人的小村庄。我在这村当了近三年小学教员，深深爱上了这个地方。这村的土地是一展平的好地，可是几乎全是旱地。清澈的河水在村旁很深的河槽里流着，人们却只能在河旁挖几眼“通河井”，用辘轳浇上有限的几亩地。一遇天旱，洓水河便干涸了。人们需要费上九牛二虎之力挖深河槽，才能有一潭泥水。因此人们又称洓水河是“修水河”。可是“修”出来的几桶泥水，顶啥用呢？地皮照样被烈日烤的焦干，裂开四指宽的缝。翻起的地净是像牛头那么大的硬土圪瘩。据老人们说，解放前在平常的年景里，一亩地收的麦子也是“多者一斗，少者三升”，年近八旬的卫新发老人告诉我：光绪三年遭了大旱，全村一百多口人就饿死了八十多口，有三十多家绝了户。在一家逃荒饿死在外的人家的炕洞内，就挖出了七架人骨头。那时天旱如此，雨涝也是同样。解放以后抗击自然灾害的能力大大加强了，但是还没有澈底改变受灾的情况。就拿1958年发洪水来说吧，仅仅下了一天暴雨，洪水便像万头凶猛的狮子似地从洓水河的上游奔腾呼啸而下，滔天的浊浪里还翻滚着连根拔起的大树和碾盘那么大的石头……。洪水溢出了河道，杨家园半个村子被冲毁了，要不是刚修成的杨家园水库大坝起了作用，整个村子就要全部被洪水卷走了。这一年地里的庄稼全部被洪水冲倒了。
    发洪水后不久，我便调离了杨家园。说心里话，在离别杨家园的一年多时间内，我几乎没有一天不思念它。特别是在今年这百年少有的大旱年内，更使我替它担心：“群众是怎样渡过1958年那严重水灾和今年这特大旱灾的？杨家园现在成了什么样子？”我这么想着，心里像着了火一样急，恨不得长对翅膀一下子飞到村里去。
    我顺着熟识的田间大道走着。可是越走越觉着不对劲，路两旁的玉茭竟这样高大稠密。往里一看，嗬，许多棵上长了三个穗子，我不由得被吸引了过去。走到里边，发现还有长四穗的呢！我踮起脚，伸直臂才能够着第三穗。“我这是到了什么地方？难道杨家园的地里能长出这样的庄稼来？”我茫然四顾，真像在大森林里迷失了方向。
      “谁在玉茭地里？”
    透过稠密的玉茭叶，我看见一个白发的老人，他一手提篮一手拄着拐杖，威严地站在地头路上。这正是卫新发老人。我急忙跑过去拉住老人的手：“卫大伯，是你啊！”他先是一怔，接着说：“我当是谁？想不到是你呀？”
    “这是咱杨家园的玉茭？”我迟疑地问。
      “嗯。——怎么，你有点不信吧？我活了这么些年，连听都没听说过，在这样干旱的年头能长出这样好的庄稼来。啊呀，今年这年头，开头可把我吓的不轻……”
    卫大伯是个十分健谈的人，他也不问我有没有急事，就站在地头上和我细谈起来，他说打从今年开春，眼看着老天多日不雨，天像着了火，地里焦巴干，洓水河见了底，井也浇干了。水库也只剩下一底水，从渠里流不出来。干部们起早熬夜，领导社员们担水点种的玉茭，有的没出苗，出苗的也很快就枯萎了。他心里想：“又要遭光绪三年那样的年景了！”没想到正在这节骨眼上，王专员、郑县长领着公社的人马来了，他们七手八脚地加深了旧
  “六一渠”，又开了条新“六一渠”，把水库里存的水引到田间，还调来了几台抽水机，几千斤化肥。王专员和郑县长亲自领导社员们浇水、施肥。就这么干了几个月，终于挽救了庄稼。
      “啊呀！要不是修了水库，要不是人民公社的力量，要不是有王专员、郑县长他们领头苦干，哪有今天这样子？”我听完轻松地出了口长气。为了急于要看看如今村里变成了什么样子，我告别了卫大伯。
    我顺着田间大道走了不多远，便登上了杨家园水库大坝，大坝比发洪水前修的更高、更厚、更结实了。满库碧水在阳光下泛着微波，像一库碎银。一群群肥鸭在水面上嬉戏，几只小船在轻轻地划着，船上的人正撒着鱼网。在水库西边不远处，座落着一排排新瓦房。新瓦房四周都是玉茭。站在堤坝上望去，村庄宛似汪洋大海中的一座小
  岛。
      “难道这就是我整天担心着、
  思念着的杨家园吗？”我带着惊疑的
  心情向村子里走去，村口场院里传
  出喜气洋洋的喧闹声。场里堆满了玉茭，社员们有的在扯玉茭皮，有的把扯光皮的玉茭穗精心地堆积起来，那黄灿灿、白生生的玉茭堆，在阳光下放着夺目的光彩。几个小学生先发现了我，欢叫着向我跑来。社员们也都热情地向我打招呼。我一眼就看见人群里的秀英妈，她站起来，拍了拍身上的土说：“食堂早吃过饭了，走，到我家吃吧。”我想推辞，她却不容，拉着我往她家里走。到场口正碰上生产队长老四赶着玉茭车回来了，我喊道：“老四哥，玉茭快收完了吧？”他兴奋地在空中抽了一鞭，答道：“才收了四十多亩，还有二百多亩呢！”
    秀英妈的家在1958年也被洪水冲了，现在住在新盖的五大间新瓦房里，院当中种着各色菊花，房内也宽敞、整洁、明亮。门正面挂着毛主席的像，没想到她家变成这个样子。我不由得又想起1958年的水灾来，但是还没等我问，她却开了口：“想起那时候，真是愁死人。东西被冲个精光，没倒的房子也是东倒西歪，好多老年人都准备往外面走了。你还记得狗小妈吧，那时狗小爹正害着重病，狗小哥又快要娶媳妇了。房子一塌，狗小哥也结不成婚了，……”
      “现在她怎么样了？”我急切地问。
      “现在？——你还是去亲眼看看她吧！日子过的可美气哩，”秀英妈笑了笑，接着说：“那时候张书记可真够苦了，白天和社员们一起挖压在房底下的东西，累的浑身是汗，滚的满身是泥。晚上召集群众开会，还挨家挨户慰问。他把眼都熬红了。
      “他在这住了很久吗？”
      “可不是，你调走的第二天，他就把铺盖卷从乡里搬来。没房子住，他让社员挤着住在没塌的房子里，自己在村口搭了个草棚住下来。一边领着大家把塌房的土往地里下，把冲倒的庄稼扶起来。他说
  ‘咱们要和老天斗到底，杨家园面貌不改变，我决不离开乡亲们。’张书记算安住了大家的心，可就是灾情实在太大了。冲坏的水库马上修不起，房子一时也没力量盖，社里别的队支援了咱村不少人和东西，可是还不能顶大事。张书记说，
  ‘要是社再大些就好办了！’没过多时，社果真变大了，好几个乡组成了一个人民公社。公社马上派来了二千多人，不到一月就把水库修好了。还派来了泥水匠，运来了砖瓦木料，七手八脚就盖起了一大片新瓦房。那年秋季正是由于张书记领着大家干，才收得了粮食呢！大家可高兴透啦，都说：‘想不到遭了大灾，反倒住上了新房子，收得了粮食！’这一来可把张书记给累的病倒了。后来他到太原看好了病就调走了！我和乡亲们真想他呀！”
    傍晚，我真的到狗小家来了。狗小家和秀英妈的家没有二样。只不过把门窗用黑漆漆了，窗上糊着雪白的纸，还嵌了一块四方玻璃，玻璃上贴着用红纸剪的花，使整个房子显得更好看了。狗小妈热情地把我让到屋里。满口说着：“好，好，啥都好！新瓦房、新娶的媳妇……要是在先前，我一个老婆子，碰上连年的天灾，不出外讨饭才怪呢！”
    说话间，进来几个年轻人。内中有个我不认识的长得挺秀气的姑娘，一进门就喊：“妈，我们突击队今晚要在咱家开会哩。”狗小妈一边应着，一边自豪地小声对我说：“这就是我儿媳妇……”那新媳妇很大方地过来和我握手，还说：“你就是刘老师吧？——听说过。调到县上工作了，对我们的工作可要多指导啊！”她那大方的言谈举动，倒使我拘束起来了。
    门外响起一阵脚步声，生产队长老四领着突击队员们来了。一会儿门吱地一声又响起来，是卫新发老汉拄着拐棍进来了。他从怀里掏出一个信封和几张信纸递给我，用手指了指墙上贴的毛主席像，说：“刘老师，帮我给他老人家写封信吧。”
    “给毛主席写信？”突击队员们都惊喜地跑过来。
    我连忙掏出笔来，说：“好，你说我写。”
    卫大伯捋着胡须，凝神地想了好一会，才用手指着信纸说：“先写上‘毛主席你老人家领导的好，如今的世道好，人民公社好，修水库好，还有，他派来的干部好！’
      “再写上，”卫大伯看了大家一眼，接着说：“杨家园村三年两头遇到大灾荒，还照样年年打下了粮食，还住上了新瓦房……”
      “还娶过了新媳妇！还……”狗小妈认真地插了一句。
