Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th: Workers in the Liuzhuang Mining Area of the Jiaozuo Mining Company in Henan Province, using the method of "three going up the mountain" for ore dressing, roasting, and crushing personnel, processed ore on-site to improve ore grade and promote a substantial increase in steel production.

The Jiaozuo Liuzhuang Mining Area, which has realized "three going up the mountain" for ore dressing, roasting, and crushing, now presents a thriving production scene. The mountain ridges where only a few miners were active in the past have now become places where thousands of mining warriors fight to obtain "high-grade ore." In front of roasting furnaces in the mining area, they carefully select ore for loading and transport down the mountain, while also throwing poor ore into the furnaces for roasting, or operating crushers to grind large pieces of ore into qualified ironmaking raw materials. They are happy that two months ago, a large part of the ore here had an iron content of only 34%, but after on-site ore dressing, on-site roasting, and on-site crushing, it has now increased to over 40%. The increase in the iron content of the ore has ensured that the blast furnaces in Jiaozuo city are well-fed and well-nourished. Since October, the daily output of pig iron has increased by about 40% compared with late September, and the quality of pig iron has also improved significantly.

In August of this year, under the guidance of the mining area party committee's instruction to "focus on the weak links in production and solve the key to current production," the workers of the Jiaozuo Liuzhuang Mining Area fully studied the significance and role of "three going up the mountain" for ore dressing, roasting, and crushing, based on the actual situation of the mining area. At that time, 40% of the ore mined here was poor ore. These ores, which did not meet the grade standards and contained many impurities, were transported down the mountain for ore dressing, crushing, and roasting by various steel plants, which not only consumed a lot of transportation capacity, but also affected the inability of some ironmaking blast furnaces to achieve high quality and high production. In order to fundamentally change this situation and ensure a greater increase in the city's steel production, the workers resolutely adopted the "three going up the mountain" measures. Following the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and focusing on the central goal of transforming poor ore into rich ore, they planned and acted simultaneously, vigorously carrying out basic construction on the mountain and launching a large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution. In a very short period of time, they dug more than 30 roasting kilns on the hillside using the natural terrain, and with the assistance of various steel plants and relevant units in the city, they quickly concentrated the crushers and roasting furnaces that were originally scattered in various plants on the mountain for use. This further exploited the potential of the equipment, achieved unified production planning, and ensured consistent action. The implementation of this measure not only enabled on-site processing of the mined ore, but also vigorously promoted the mechanization and semi-mechanization of production links such as ore mining, transportation, and hoisting. At present, the mining area has partially used advanced tools such as pneumatic picks and pneumatic drills for mining, which greatly improved the efficiency of stripping. In August and September, more than 130,000 cubic meters of ore were stripped and more than 10,000 tons of ore were mined. The stripping efficiency in September increased by more than 40% compared with August. In addition, the entire mining area has erected more than 26,000 meters (single line) of power supply lines, built more than 5,000 meters of small railways, and installed electric winches, air compressors, and other power equipment, and also converted the original wooden winches for hoisting and transporting ore into electric hoists that increased efficiency several times. In the process of vigorously developing mechanization and semi-mechanization, the workers of the mining area tried every means to overcome difficulties and ensure the normal production of various production links and the comprehensive leap forward in production. At present, the stripping efficiency of the entire mining area has increased by 46.2% compared with two months ago, and the ore output has doubled.

Now, the Liuzhuang Mining Area has promptly improved production management work and trained more than 200 technical workers based on the new situation after "three going up the mountain" for ore dressing, roasting, and crushing. The entire mining area has now established ore dressing, roasting, and crushing workshops, strengthened departments such as electromechanical maintenance and testing, and equipped each mining point and work section with strong leading cadres. They also adjusted the labor organization, achieved fixed staffing and quotas according to the different needs of ore dressing, crushing, and roasting tasks, and strengthened the leadership of daily production. The workers of the entire mining area are very enthusiastic and determined to produce more and better ore to support high quality and high production in blast furnaces.

    树立增产优质矿石的观念　采取雷厉风行的措施
    变贫矿为富矿让高炉多产好铁
    刘庄采区选矿、焙烧、粉碎人员上山就地加工矿石
    新华社郑州4日电　河南省焦作市采矿公司刘庄采区职工，采用选矿、焙烧、粉碎人员“三上山”的办法，就地选焙粉碎矿石，努力提高矿石品位，促进了钢铁产量大幅度增长。
    实现了选焙粉碎“三上山”的焦作刘庄采区，现在已经呈现出一片蓬勃的生产景象。过去仅有少数采矿人活动的山岗，如今已经成为千百个矿山战士为获取“高品位矿石”而战的场所。他们在采区内一座座焙烧炉前，一面精心选矿装车下山，一面将贫矿投进炉里焙烧，或者操纵着粉碎机把大块的矿石轧成粒度合格的炼铁原料。他们高兴的是：两个月前，这里的矿石有很大一部分含铁量仅有34％，可是经过他们就地选矿、就地焙烧、就地粉碎后，现在已经提高到40％以上了。由于矿石含铁量的提高，保证了焦作全市高炉吃饱吃好。10月份以来，生铁日产量比9月下旬提高40％左右，生铁质量也有显著提高。
    今年8月，焦作刘庄采区的职工，在采区党委“狠抓生产薄弱环节、解决当前生产关键”的指示下，从采区实际情况出发，充分研究了选矿、焙烧、粉碎“三上山”的意义和作用。当时，这儿开采出来的矿石，有40％是贫矿。这些品位标准不够、带有很多杂质的矿石运到山下，由各钢铁厂进行选矿、粉碎、焙烧加工，不仅耗用了很多运力，而且影响到部分炼铁高炉不能优质高产。职工们为了从根本上改变这种状况，确保全市钢铁生产的更大增产，坚决采取了“三上山”的措施。他们按照土洋并举的方针，围绕着使贫矿变富矿这一中心目标，一边规划、一边行动，大力进行山上基本建设和大闹技术革新、技术革命。在很短的时间内，他们就在山坡上利用自然地形挖筑了三十多座焙烧窑，同时又在各钢铁厂和市内有关单位的协助下，把原来分散在各厂的粉碎机、焙烧炉迅速集中到山上使用。从而进一步发挥了设备潜力，做到了生产计划的统一和行动步调一致。这一措施的实现，不仅做到了就地加工采出的矿石，而且有力地推动了矿石开采、运输、提升等生产环节的机械化半机械化运动。目前，这个采区已部分地使用风镐、风钻等先进工具采矿，大大提高了剥离工效。8、9两月共剥离矿石十三万多立方米，采出矿石万余吨；9月比8月剥离效率提高40％以上。此外，全采区还架设了供电线路二万六千多米（单线），修建了小铁路五千多米，安设了电绞车、空气压缩机等若干动力设备，把原有提运矿石的木制绞车，也改装成了工效增加数倍的电动卷扬机。采区职工在大搞机械化半机械化的过程中，千方百计地克服困难，保证了各个生产环节的正常生产与生产的全面跃进。目前全区的剥离效率已比两个月前提高了46.2％，矿石产量提高了一倍。
    现在，刘庄采区已经根据选矿、焙烧、破碎“三上山”后的新情况，及时改进了生产管理工作，培训了二百多名技术工人。全采区目前已经建立了选矿、焙烧、粉碎车间，加强了机电维修、化验等部门，并且为各个采点、工段配备了较强的领导干部。他们还调整了劳动组织，按选矿、粉碎、焙烧任务的不同需要，实现了定员、定额，加强了日常生产的领导。全采区职工热情很高，决心生产出更多更好的矿石，支援高炉优质高产。
