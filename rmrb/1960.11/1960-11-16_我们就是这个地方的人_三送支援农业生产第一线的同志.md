“We are the People of this Place”
——A Third Send-off to Comrades Supporting Agricultural Production First Line
Ge Song

On Jinggang Mountain, you can hear accents from all over the southeast, northwest, and you can meet transferred cadres from all directions. However, they all say the same thing, in unison: "We are Jinggang Mountain people!"

Here, the term "native place" has a new definition. People no longer regard their birthplace or their parents' hometown as their native place, but rather the place where they are working, fighting, and living. Can you say they are just joking? No, there is a very serious issue here.

True, they have come from afar. However, from the first day they came to the mountain, even from the first step they took from the starting point, they made up their minds to be Jinggang Mountain people for life. Although not born here, they will labor here, work here, and even grow old here. Not only do they think this way, but they also act this way. Many people move their families to the mountain, transfer their household registration to the mountain, truly settle down and become genuine Jinggang Mountain people. If we use a tree as a metaphor, its roots may have originally been planted in the yellow soil of the north or the water villages of the south, but due to need, it was transplanted to the mountain. After arriving on the mountain, is it better to take root or not? This is a matter of common sense. Taking root allows it to absorb abundant nutrients, enabling the tree to grow strong, blossom, and bear fruit, becoming a pillar of talent. What if it doesn't take root? Perhaps it can still be bright and beautiful for a few days, but in the end, it will only wither. The comrades engaged in production and construction on Jinggang Mountain have already proved this principle, and many comrades who have gone to the forefront of agricultural production have already, or are in the process of, providing more proof of this principle.

Fifteen years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "All comrades who go to the front should make mental preparations, prepare to take root, blossom, and bear fruit when they get there. We Communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. When we arrive in a place, we must unite with the people there and take root and blossom among the people."
(《Selected Works of Mao Zedong》, Volume 4, page 1161) At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong was speaking to comrades departing from Yan'an to the front lines and new areas. Today, we have another large group of comrades going to the forefront of socialist construction. Isn't it possible to gain infinite encouragement by reviewing the instructions of the great leader?

Comrades who go to the forefront of agricultural production always have their own lofty ambitions before departure, preparing to humbly learn and be students of the masses after arriving in the countryside, and at the same time, to be both red and expert, contributing their lifelong strength to the construction of the countryside. This lays a good foundation for the work of taking root. Let us plant our roots deeper and deeper, and proudly say like the comrades on Jinggang Mountain: "We are Jinggang Mountain people!" Let us also loudly say: "We are the people of this county, this commune!"

    “我们就是这个地方的人”
    ——三送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    在井冈山上，可以听到东南西北的口音，可以遇到来自四面八方的下放干部，然而他们众口一词，异口同声：“我们是井冈山人！”
    在这里，籍贯这个词有了新的定义。人们不再把自己诞生地或者父母亲的故乡、而是把正在劳动、战斗和生活的地方，作为自己的籍贯。你能说他们是说着玩的？不，这里面有个十分严肃的问题。
    不错，他们是不远千里而来的。但是，从上山的第一天起，甚至从出发点走开第一步的时候起，他们就立定志愿，终身做一个井冈山人。虽然不是生于斯，但是却要劳动于斯，工作于斯，以至终老于斯。不仅是这样想，而且也这样做，许多人把家搬上山，把户口迁上山，真正地安家落户，成了道道地地的井冈山人。如果拿一棵树来做比方吧，它的根原也许是栽在北方的黄土或是南方的水乡的，但是由于需要，把它移植到山上来了。到了山上以后，是生根好还是不生根好？这是常识性问题。生根，就能吸收丰富养料，使这棵树茁壮成长，开花结果，成了一棵栋梁之材。不生根呢？也许它还能明媚鲜妍过上几天，但终久只有枯萎的结局。在井冈山上生产建设的同志，已经为这个道理作了证明，许多到农业生产第一线去的同志，也已经或者正在为这个道理作更多的证明。
    十五年前，毛泽东同志就告诉我们：“所有到前方去的同志，都应当做好精神准备，准备到了那里，就要生根、开花、结果。我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。”
  （《毛泽东选集》第四卷1161页）那时候，毛泽东同志是对从延安出发到前方、到新区去的同志们说的。今天，我们又有大批同志去到社会主义建设的前线去了，重新温习一下伟大的领袖的指示，不是可以得到无穷的鼓舞力量吗？
    到农业生产第一线去的同志，在出发以前，总是有自己的壮志雄心，准备到农村以后，一面虚心学习，做群众的小学生；一面红透专深，为建设农村贡献自己终身的力量。这就为生根的工作打好了基础。把根扎得深一些、再深一些吧，像井冈山的同志们那样自豪地说：“我们是井冈山人！”让我们也响亮地说：“我们就是这个县这个公社的人！”
