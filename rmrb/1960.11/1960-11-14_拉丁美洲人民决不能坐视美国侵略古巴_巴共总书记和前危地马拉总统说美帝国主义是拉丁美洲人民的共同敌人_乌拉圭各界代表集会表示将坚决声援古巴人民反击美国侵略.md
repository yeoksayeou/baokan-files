Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 7th -- Brazilian Communist Party General Secretary Prestes, in a recent issue of the "New Direction" weekly, published an article titled "Defending Cuba is Our Patriotic Duty," writing: "For all patriots and democrats in Latin America, Cuba is an example, an inspiration."

Prestes said: The U.S. imperialism is launching an aggression against Cuba, which is actually an attack on the people of Latin American countries, in order to maintain Washington's interests throughout Latin America. Prestes pointed out: "Moreover, the U.S. imperialists know that the socialist camp, especially the powerful Soviet Union, stands on the side of the Cuban people."

Prestes added: "The robbers of the Washington ruling clique must understand: if they dare to touch Cuba, all Brazilian patriots and democrats will never sit idly by. They will rise up and unite to support the people of Cuba, the birthplace of Martí (Cuban national hero), and will take this opportunity to intensify their own struggle to win the complete liberation of Brazil and drive the American exploiters and oppressors out of Brazilian territory. The Brazilian people must be mobilized to unite around the historic Havana Declaration, which is the true program of the people of Latin American countries."

Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- Havana News: Former Guatemalan President Arbenz said in a television broadcast in Cuba on the 10th that those who truly want to fight against imperialism should first clear the dregs of "anti-communism" from their minds.

He said that the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is based on maintaining peace and maintaining mutually respectful relations with all countries. U.S. imperialism, on the other hand, pursues a policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and on the brink of war. Arbenz emphasized that U.S. imperialism is not only Cuba's enemy, but also the enemy of all Latin American people. He said that the people of Latin America are mobilizing and raising the banner of struggle for their rights. Inspired by the Cuban example, the people of Latin America have raised their awareness and believe that they can achieve final liberation by relying on their own strength.

Speaking of the U.S. elections, Arbenz pointed out that Kennedy, who was recently elected president, and Nixon, the defeated candidate, "represent the same forces," because the U.S. monopoly groups are in power in the United States. They not only install running dogs and puppets in semi-colonial countries, but also in their own homes.

The Mexican weekly "Permanent" recently published Arbenz's conversation with a special correspondent of the magazine. Arbenz said: A climax of the liberation struggle will appear in all Latin American countries. Imperialism can never stop the course of history. The Cuban revolution has set an example for all Latin American people and opened their eyes.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- Montevideo News: The Uruguayan Committee to Support the Cuban Revolution held a rally last night in support of Cuba. Representatives of the Uruguayan Workers' United Trade Union, the Student Federation, and organizations such as the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, as well as representatives of the city branches of the Committee to Support the Cuban Revolution, unanimously announced at the meeting that once imperialism invades Cuba, the Uruguayan people will take to the streets to defend Cuba. Speakers also pointed out that the only way to effectively deal with imperialism and domestic oligarchs is for the people of the whole country to unite and oppose the conspiracy of aggression against Cuba that attempts to cover up with "anti-communism."

At this meeting, a national signature campaign to support the Cuban revolution and the Havana Declaration was officially launched, so that on January 1 next year, a document with hundreds of thousands of signatures can be handed over to the Cuban people and government.

    拉丁美洲人民决不能坐视美国侵略古巴
    巴共总书记和前危地马拉总统说美帝国主义是拉丁美洲人民的共同敌人
    乌拉圭各界代表集会表示将坚决声援古巴人民反击美国侵略
    新华社里约热内卢7日电　巴西共产党总书记普列斯特斯在最近一期“新方针”周刊上以“保卫古巴是我们的爱国责任”为题发表的文章写道：“对拉丁美洲的所有爱国者和民主分子来说，古巴是榜样，是鼓舞”。
    普列斯特斯说：美国帝国主义要对古巴发动侵略，实际上就是对拉丁美洲各国人民的进攻，以保持华盛顿在整个拉丁美洲的利益。普列斯特斯指出：“此外，美国帝国主义者知道，站在古巴人民一边的有社会主义阵营，特别有强大的苏联。”
    普列斯特斯又说：“华盛顿统治集团的强盗们必须懂得：如果他们敢于碰古巴，巴西的所有爱国者和民主分子决不会坐视不顾，他们将奋起团结一致支援马蒂（古巴民族英雄）出生地古巴的人民，并将趁此机会加紧进行他们自己的斗争，来争取巴西的完全解放，把美国剥削者和压迫者赶出巴西国土。必须动员巴西人民团结在历史性的哈瓦那宣言周围，这个宣言是拉丁美洲各国人民的真正纲领。”
    新华社12日讯　哈瓦那消息：前危地马拉总统阿本斯10日在古巴发表电视广播说：那些真正愿为反对帝国主义而进行斗争的人，首先应该从他们头脑里清除“反共”的渣滓。
    他说，苏联和其它社会主义国家的外交政策是以维护和平和同所有的国家保持相互尊重的关系为基础的。而美帝国主义则与此相反，执行着干涉其他国家内政和战争边缘的政策。阿本斯强调说，美帝国主义不仅是古巴的敌人，同时也是所有拉丁美洲人民的敌人。他说，拉丁美洲人民正在动员起来和举起争取自己权利的旗帜在古巴范例的鼓舞下，拉丁美洲人民提高了觉悟，并相信依靠自己的力量可以取得最后的解放。
    在谈到美国选举的时候，阿本斯指出，最近当选为总统的肯尼迪和落选的候选人尼克松“代表着同样势力”，因为在美国掌权的是美国垄断集团，它们不但在半殖民地国家安插走狗和傀儡，在它们自己家里也是这样。
    墨西哥永久周刊在最近一期发表了阿本斯对这家杂志特派记者的谈话。阿本斯说：在所有拉丁美洲的国家中都将出现解放斗争的高潮。帝国主义决不能阻止历史的进程。古巴革命已为全体拉丁美洲人民树立了榜样，打开了他们的眼界。
    新华社12日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭支援古巴革命委员会昨晚举行了声援古巴大会，参加大会的乌拉圭工人统一工会、学生联合会和共产党、社会党等组织的代表以及支援古巴革命委员会各城市分会的代表在会上一致宣布，帝国主义一旦侵略古巴，乌拉圭人民将走上大街去保卫古巴。发言者还指出，有成效地对付帝国主义和本国寡头的唯一道路就是全国人民团结起来，反对那种企图用“反共”来掩饰的对古巴的侵略阴谋。
    在这次大会上正式开始了支持古巴革命和哈瓦那宣言的全国性签名运动，以便在明年1月1日，把一份有数十万签名的文件交给古巴人民和政府。
