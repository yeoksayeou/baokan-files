Deeply Publicize the Party's Policies, Guide the Masses to Develop Agricultural and Sideline Production in a Timely Manner
Caijia Production Team Expands Winter Planting and Raises More Pigs
    (Our report) According to Zhejiang Daily: How can we, through vigorously publicizing and implementing the Party's policies, guide the masses' soaring enthusiasm to focus on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and organize an even greater production upsurge? The Caijia Production Team of Qinghu Commune in Jiangshan County provides some experience.
    This team, through vigorously publicizing and implementing the Party's policies, has greatly improved the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses of its members. Many members have approached the cadres to discuss work, urgently demanding stronger leadership over current production. To meet the demands of the masses and further promote a production upsurge, the production team's Party branch convened a meeting of cadres. By discussing the situation, outlining tasks, and identifying the goals for next year's production and some problems existing in current production, everyone recognized that the current situation is extremely favorable, but leadership must be strengthened to quickly guide the masses' soaring enthusiasm to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and to create an even greater production upsurge, so that next year's summer harvest will be better than any previous year.
    After the cadres' thinking was unified, the Party branch immediately carried out ideological education among the masses on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. On the one hand, a mass summary and comparison was conducted throughout the team, two advanced teams and two hundred and thirty-five outstanding members were selected, and model figures such as elderly member Wang Chaojia, young member Cao Yuanming, and woman He Zhaoting were chosen to launch a mass labor emulation drive of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping. At the same time, each team was mobilized to conduct land surveys and tap potential, and to generally formulate plans for exceeding contracted output and exceeding planned production, as well as plans for autumn harvest and winter planting. This further clarified the direction and goals for the broad masses of members, better unleashing their production enthusiasm and initiative. Through land surveys, the Caijia Team found five mu of scattered land and ten mu of loess hills, all of which were planted with crops.
    The Party branch also mobilized members to discuss the relationship between collective production and members' household production. The members unanimously agreed that collective production should be done well first, and on this premise, members should also actively engage in household production, but household production should not hinder collective production. After the discussion, they proposed many methods in terms of working hours and work quotas to ensure collective production. For example, labor on members' private plots should be carried out during spare time in the morning and evening and on holidays. At the same time, the production team helped members solve specific problems in household production. To help members raise pigs, the production team solved the problem of piglets for members, and the team lent out some sweet potato vines as feed. The production team also exchanged some seeds for members and helped them expand the planting of "hundred-jin grain." A reasonable price was set for the fertilizer invested by members. After doing this, the members became more concerned about collective production. Recently, members invested one hundred and twenty dan of ash fertilizer and more than seven thousand jin of human manure in the team, providing more fertilizer for collective production.
    Now, an even greater production upsurge is emerging in the Caijia Production Team. The enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of members is soaring, and everyone is striving to exceed plans and exceed contracted output. Attendance and work efficiency have greatly improved. While doing a good job in collective production and ensuring the completion of contracted tasks, the broad masses of members are also doing everything possible to improve the team's expanded planting and members' household production. At present, the team has expanded the planting of grain and other crops by seventy-eight mu, and the team's seven teams have increased the raising of pigs by one hundred and thirty-nine, and members have also raised fifty-three.

    深入宣传党的政策及时引导群众发展农副业生产
    蔡家生产队扩大冬种多养生猪
    本报讯　据浙江日报消息：怎样通过大力宣传和贯彻执行党的政策，把广大社员高涨的热情引导到大办农业、大办粮食方面来，组织更大的生产高潮？江山县清湖公社蔡家生产队提供了一些经验。
    这个队通过大张旗鼓宣传和贯彻执行政策，广大社员的政治热情和生产积极性有了很大提高，不少社员纷纷找干部商量工作，迫切要求加强对当前生产的领导。为了适应群众的要求，进一步推动生产高潮，生产队的党支部召开了干部会议。通过谈形势，摆任务，摆出了明年生产的奋斗目标和当前生产中存在的一些问题，使大家认识到当前形势极为有利，但是必须加强领导，把群众高涨的热情迅速引导到大办农业、大办粮食上来，掀起更大的生产高潮，才能使明年的夏收比以往任何一年都好。
    干部的思想统一以后，党支部又立即向群众进行了大办农业、大办粮食的思想教育。一方面在全队进行了一次群众性的总结评比，评出两个先进小队、二百三十五个优秀社员，选出老年社员王朝家、青年社员曹元明、妇女何招亭等标兵人物，开展了群众性的比、学、赶、帮劳动竞赛运动。同时，发动各小队通过排土地、挖潜力，普遍制定了超包产超计划的规划和秋收冬种计划。这样就使广大社员进一步明确了前进的方向和奋斗的目标，更好地发挥了生产积极性和主动性。蔡家小队通过土地排队，社员找出五亩零星土地、十亩黄土丘都种上了作物。
    党支部还发动社员讨论了集体生产与社员家庭生产的关系。社员们一致认为，首先要搞好集体生产，在这个前提下，社员也应积极从事家庭生产，但家庭生产不能妨碍集体生产。讨论以后，他们在劳动时间、劳动定额等方面提出了许多办法来保证集体生产。如社员在自留地上的劳动，利用早晚工余时间和放假日进行。同时，生产队又帮助社员解决家庭生产中的具体问题。为了帮助社员养猪，生产队给社员解决仔猪问题，小队借出一部分番薯藤作饲料。生产队还调换给社员一些种子，帮助社员扩种“百斤粮”。对社员投资的肥料，确定了合理的价格。这样做了以后，社员对集体生产更加关心了，最近社员向小队投资灰肥一百二十担，人粪尿七千多斤，使集体生产有了更多的肥料。
    现在，蔡家生产队一个更大的生产高潮正在兴起，广大社员生产的积极性和创造性日益高涨，人人力争超规划、超包产。出勤率和工效大大提高。在搞好集体生产和保证完成包产任务的同时，广大社员还千方百计搞好小队扩种和社员家庭生产，目前，全队已经扩种了粮食等作物七十八亩，全队七个小队增养生猪一百三十九头，社员也养了五十三头。
