Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 12th – The staff and workers on the coal and transportation fronts in Jilin Province have demonstrated the spirit of putting others first and prioritizing external needs over internal ones, ensuring the completion of the external transfer plan while also taking measures to meet the needs of increased steel production within the province.

In October, the province exceeded its coal export plan, with the transfer volume increasing by 34.8% compared to September. From November 1st to 6th, there was a further increase compared to the same period in October. The supply of coking coal and raw coal to key steel enterprises in the province increased by 6.8% in October compared to September.

The Jilin Provincial Party Committee at all levels has always attached importance to coal export work. Zhao Lin, Second Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, personally oversees the coal export work, checking the implementation of the plan every day, and personally went to the two major mining bureaus in Tonghua and Liaoyuan within the province to organize high coal production and transportation, specifically assisting key stations and mines in arranging the overall transformation of transportation lines to ensure rapid coal exports. In areas with a large amount of coal exports, the coal, metallurgy, and transportation units have formed a joint office to specifically focus on coal export work. The Party committees and staff of the coal and transportation departments have all placed the task of coal export first. The Jilin Railway Bureau, from the Bureau Party Committee to each station, has made the first leader responsible for coal export. The Secretary of the Bureau Party Committee and the Director grasp the coal export work twice a day, giving priority to external transportation needs in terms of vehicle allocation, loading and unloading forces, and maintenance. They arrange "two lines of defense" for vehicles used for coal exports to ensure that no externally transferred coal is delayed by a single vehicle, a single ton, a single minute.

This year, the coking coal used for steel production in Jilin Province is basically sufficient. Due to the rapid increase in production of key steel enterprises nationwide, the task of coking coal exports continues to increase, resulting in a significant shortage of coking coal within Jilin Province. The Jilin Provincial Party Committee, adhering to the spirit of leaving the difficulties to itself and providing convenience to others, resolutely accepted the state's external transfer task and ensured that it would be completed without owing a single vehicle or ton. To address the shortage of coking coal within the province, great efforts have been made to tap internal potential. At the end of September, Wang Jiatong, Deputy Director of the Provincial Transportation Committee, personally organized more than 1,000 laborers to rush to repair the twenty-nine kilometers of earth railway on the Shensonggang Mine to Tie Road. Now, more than 100,000 tons of coking coal stored in the Shensonggang Coal Mine is being transported out urgently. Since September, the province has also used coal slime to produce more than 25,000 tons of coke. At the same time, steel workers across the province have also vigorously reduced the coke ratio and saved coking coal. Due to these measures, while giving priority to completing the task of exporting coal, the coal needs of key steel enterprises in the province have also been guaranteed.

### 吉林调煤　一吨不少

    吉林调煤　一吨不少
    据新华社长春12日电　吉林省煤炭、运输战线职工，发扬先人后己、先外后内的精神，既保证了外调计划的完成，又采取措施满足了省内钢铁增产的需要。
    10月份全省超额完成了煤炭外运计划，调运量比9月提高34.8％；11月1日到6日，比10月同期又有提高。供应省内重点钢铁企业的焦煤、原煤量10月比9月提高6.8％。
    中共吉林省各级党委一向重视煤炭外运工作。省委第二书记赵林亲自掌握煤炭外运工作，每天检查计划执行情况，并亲到省内通化、辽源两大矿务局组织煤炭高产高运，具体帮助重点站、矿安排运输线路的总体改造，来保证快速运出煤炭。煤炭外运较多的地区，还由煤炭、冶金、运输三个单位组成联合办公室，专门抓煤炭外运工作。各煤炭、运输部门党委和职工，都把煤炭外调任务摆在首位。吉林铁路局，从局党委到各车站，都以第一把手抓煤炭外运。局党委书记、局长一天抓两次煤炭外运工作，在调配车辆，装卸力量，检修等方面，首先保证外运需要。他们对外调煤炭用的车辆，以安排“两道防线”的办法，保证不使外调煤炭拖欠一车一吨，晚开一点一分。
    今年吉林省钢铁生产所用焦煤是基本够用的。由于全国重点钢铁企业增产速度很快，焦煤外调任务不断增加，因而吉林省内焦煤显著不足。中共吉林省委本着把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人的精神，坚决接受了国家外调任务，并保证车吨不欠的完成任务。省内焦煤不足，就大挖内部潜力，9月末，省运输委员会副主任王家桐亲自组织一千多名劳动力抢修了杉松岗矿通铁路线的二十九公里的土铁路，现在正在把杉松岗煤矿存的十万多吨焦煤赶运出来。9月以来，全省还用煤泥炼出二万五千多吨焦炭。同时，全省钢铁职工还大力降低焦比，节约焦煤。由于采取这些措施，在优先完成外调煤炭任务的情况下，也保证了本省重点钢铁企业的用煤。
