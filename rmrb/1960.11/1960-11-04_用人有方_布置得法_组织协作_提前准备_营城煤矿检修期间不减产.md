Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd: During a major overhaul in mid-October at the No. 8 shaft of the Yingcheng Coal Mine in Jilin Province, the Tongtian winch completed work that originally required eight hours in just four hours. Such an overhaul usually reduces the mine's coal output by more than 200 tons. However, for the three days before and after this overhaul, coal production not only did not decrease, but the daily coal output increased by 48 tons compared to before the overhaul. This situation of maintaining production during overhaul has become routine at the Yingcheng Coal Mine.

The coal mine's ability to maintain production during overhauls is primarily due to the mine's Party Committee fully mobilizing the masses, fostering mutual cooperation, formulating meticulous overhaul plans, preparing everything for the overhaul, and adopting the methods of assigning personnel, defining projects, setting time limits, and ensuring quality, thus implementing the overhaul plan item by item. During the overhaul, all trades race against time, thus achieving a fast and high-quality overhaul level. More than 20 days before the No. 8 shaft overhauled the Tongtian winch, technicians and veteran workers from the electromechanical department began preparing in terms of manpower, materials, and mechanical parts, assigning each component needing repair to a specific person. Before the overhaul, the Party Committee Secretary personally chaired a professional meeting and reviewed the preparatory work three times. Finding that the overhaul time for the winch shaft was insufficient, it was immediately decided to advance the processing. After the overhaul work began, the Party Committee Secretary, mine manager, and leaders at the shaft also went to the site to work with the overhaul workers to find solutions, trying every means to shorten the overhaul time and improve the overhaul quality, thus further stimulating the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm and ensuring the early completion of the overhaul task.

In order to ensure that both overhaul and production are not delayed, the mine carefully arranges production in advance for each overhaul. On the first day of the overhaul, they mobilize production workers to concentrate all their efforts on coal extraction, postponing production preparation work such as laying chutes, returning pit props, building sheds, and drilling holes to the overhaul time, so that there is sufficient time to catch up with output before the overhaul. On the day of the overhaul, the production workers also advance the preparatory work for striving for high yields after the overhaul. In this way, the time originally used for production preparation for the two days before and after the overhaul is turned into coal extraction time, so that the average output for the three days is not reduced. During this period, the entire mine also took the overhaul as a driving force, launching a mass movement of "you overhaul, I support; I overhaul, you support; vow to seize high production for the entire mine" at the shafts and working faces without overhaul tasks, to ensure that the entire mine's production is not reduced during the overhaul. For example, on May 20 this year, the No. 5 shaft overhauled the Tongtian winch and replaced railway sleepers, requiring 24 man-hours and reducing output by 720 tons. However, due to the above-mentioned methods, on the one hand, various shafts were mobilized to support the No. 5 shaft's overhaul, and on the other hand, production preparations were made in the No. 5 shaft. As a result, the daily output of this mine reached more than 1,600 tons in the three days before and after the overhaul, not only did production not decrease, but it also exceeded the original daily plan by more than 130 tons. At the same time, the entire mine's daily output also increased by 35% compared to the usual planned targets.

The practice of maintaining production during overhauls at the Yingcheng Coal Mine began in May this year. In May this year, Luo Tingfu, the Secretary of the Mine's Party Committee, proposed the suggestion of vigorously promoting collaboration, organizing high production, and achieving both overhaul and production without delay at a meeting. After discussion, everyone believed that as long as the work is done well and the initiative of the workers is fully utilized, even if this suggestion cannot be fully realized, the overhaul time can be greatly shortened. After the meeting, the Party Committee conveyed this idea to the grass-roots cadres and electromechanical workers, and immediately received their full support. Subsequently, a mass movement to strive for production without reduction during overhauls was quickly launched throughout the mine. In May, the entire mine underwent 142 hours of major overhauls. According to conventional practice, more than 3,500 tons of coal would be reduced, but due to the development of the overhaul-without-reduction movement, not only was production not reduced, but the coal output of the entire mine also increased by 28,000 tons compared to April. Since then, the contradiction between production and overhaul has found a correct solution.

### 用人有方　布置得法　组织协作　提前准备  营城煤矿检修期间不减产

    用人有方　布置得法　组织协作　提前准备
    营城煤矿检修期间不减产
    据新华社长春3日电　吉林省营城煤矿八井的通天绞车在10月中旬的一次大检修中，只用四小时完成了原需八小时的工作量；作这样一次检修，通常要使全井减产二百多吨煤炭，而这次检修前后的三天，煤产量不仅没有减少，反而比检修前的煤炭日产量增长四十八吨。像这种检修不减产的情况，在营城煤矿已经成为常规。
    这个煤矿能够做到检修不减产，首先是因为矿党委充分发动群众，互相协作，并制定严密的检修计划，做好检修的一切准备，并采取定人员、定项目、定时间和定质量的方法，把检修计划逐项落实。检修中，各工种之间，争分夺秒，因而能够达到速度快、质量高的检修水平。八井在检修通天绞车的前二十多天，机电部门的技术人员和老技工就着手从人力、物力、机械配件等方面作准备，把每一个需要检修的部件落实到每个人身上。检修以前党委书记又亲自主持召开专业会议，三次复查准备工作。检查中发现绞车轴检修时间不够用，立即决定提前加工。检修工作开始以后，党委书记、矿长和井口领导干部，又到现场和检修工人一起想办法，千方百计地缩短检修时间，提高检修质量，因此进一步激发了工人的革命干劲，保证了提前完成检修任务。
    为了做到检修、生产两不误，这个矿在每次检修中，都提前认真安排生产。他们在检修开始的头一天就发动生产职工，集中全力出煤，把当天的铺溜子、回坑木、棚棚子、打眼等生产准备工作，推迟到检修时间进行，使检修前有充分时间赶产量。检修当天，生产工人又把检修以后争取高产的准备工作提前做好。这样就使检修前后两天原来用作生产准备的时间，都变成出煤时间，做到三天平均产量不减产。在这期间，全矿还以检修为动力，在无检修任务的井口和掌子面上，发动“你检修我支援，我检修你支援，誓夺全矿高产”的群众运动，保证全矿检修不减产。例如，今年5月20日，五井检修通天绞车和更换铁道枕木，需要工时二十四个小时，减少产量七百二十吨。但是由于采取了上述办法，一方面发动各井支援五井检修，一方面又在五井作好了生产准备，结果这个矿井在检修前后三天日产量达到了一千六百多吨，不但没有减产，还超过原定日计划一百三十多吨。同时全矿日产量也比平时计划指标提高35％。
    营城煤矿这种检修不减产的做法，是从今年5月份开始的。今年5月，矿党委书记罗廷富在一次会议上提出大搞协作，组织高产，实现检修、生产两不误的建议。经过讨论以后，大家认为只要把工作做好，充分发挥职工的能动作用，即使不能完全实现这个建议，也可大大缩短检修时间。会后党委把这种想法，在基层干部和机电工人中进行酝酿，立即得到了他们的全力支持。接着一个群众性的争取检修不减产的运动，很快在全矿开展起来。5月份全矿进行了一百四十二小时的大检修。按常规要减少三千五百多吨煤，但是由于开展了检修不减产运动，不但没有减产，全矿煤炭产量还比4月份增长了二万八千吨。从此生产与检修之间的矛盾找到了正确的解决方法。
