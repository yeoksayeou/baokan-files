    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd – Approximately two thousand representatives of Korean residents living in Tokyo and neighboring prefectures held a rally in Tokyo today, unanimously expressing their warm support for the initiative of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea "on further promoting the peaceful reunification of the fatherland."

    Han Dok-su, chairman of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, read out the full text of the report by Choe Yong-gon, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, delivered at the eighth session of the Supreme People's Assembly held on the 19th. When Han Dok-su finished reading the report, thunderous and prolonged applause erupted throughout the venue.

    In his speech, Han Dok-su pointed out that this proposal is full of compassion for compatriots and is a just proposal. He believes that the people of South Korea will also express their support after learning of this proposal.

    Han Dok-su pointed out that we should find ways to convey the proposal to the South Korean compatriots, and at the same time, we should make the Japanese people aware of the proposal so that they can force the Japanese government to stop the talks with the South Korean puppet clique. Han Dok-su said that this is the glorious task of the Korean residents in Japan.

    The participants unanimously passed a letter to Premier Kim Il-sung, expressing their determination to unite and strive to realize this proposal.

    支持朝鲜和平统一倡议
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：旅居东京和邻近各县的朝侨代表约两千人今天在东京举行集会，一致表示热烈支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议“关于进一步促进祖国的和平统一”的倡议。
    旅日朝鲜人总联合会议长韩德铢在会上宣读了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健在19日召开的最高人民会议第八次会议上所作的有关报告全文。当韩德铢把报告读完时，全场响起了经久不息的热烈掌声。
    韩德铢在会上讲话时指出，这项建议充满热爱同胞的热情，是正义的建议。他相信，南朝鲜人民在得悉这个建议后也会表示支持。
    韩德铢指出，我们应该想办法把建议传达给南朝鲜同胞，而且应该同时使日本人民知道这项建议，以便他们迫使日本政府停止同南朝鲜傀儡集团的会谈。韩德铢说，这是旅日朝侨的光荣任务。
    与会者一致通过给金日成首相的信，表示他们将团结起来，为实现这项建议而奋斗。
