The Lishui County Party Committee Secretary Assists Grassroots Cadres in Resolutely Implementing Policies.

(Our dispatch) Zhejiang Lishui County’s Chengguan Commune Houpu Production Team cadres, with the help of responsible comrades from the County Party Committee, have enhanced their awareness of implementing the Party’s policies, adhered to the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, and greatly mobilized the masses’ enthusiasm for careful harvesting and threshing.

Before the autumn harvest began, Sui Rongqing, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, went to the Houpu Production Team to work. He discovered that there were two different views among the production team cadres on how to complete the autumn harvest task quickly and well. Some people believed that under the inspiration of the Party Central Committee’s great call for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, as long as an autumn harvest plan was drawn up, a set of technical regulations for careful harvesting and threshing were drafted, and then the tasks were assigned, the task could be completed. Others believed that this year's autumn harvest task was heavy and time was tight. Only by conscientiously implementing the Party’s policies, adhering to the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the commune members could the autumn harvest work be done well.

Summarize Experiences and Improve Understanding

In order to unify the cadres' thinking, Sui Rongqing first guided the cadres to summarize their experience in implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. This team performed well in implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system last year. The spring flowers and early rice grew very well. However, in the summer harvest and planting, because the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system was not strictly implemented, although a set of detailed harvesting and threshing operating procedures was discussed at the time, some commune members did not pay attention to it and did not implement it conscientiously, which affected the detailed harvesting and threshing work. This vivid fact profoundly educated the cadres, making everyone realize that to lead the autumn harvest well, they must conscientiously implement the Party’s policies, adhere to the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses.

Widely Solicit Commune Members' Opinions

After summarizing the experience in implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, Sui Rongqing guided the cadres to listen to the opinions of the commune members and see what the commune members actually thought of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. After in-depth understanding, they found that both teams with high and low production increases urgently demanded the resolute implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system. Commune members from teams with high production increases saw this year's bumper harvest and urgently wanted to know how much surplus grain they could get. Teams with low production increases also hoped that the trial calculation plan for the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" could be announced as soon as possible. They said: It's good to know whether it is a reward or a loss early on, and we can still get more from the fields now. In this way, the cadres saw even more that adhering to the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system was the urgent demand of the broad masses of commune members, and they improved their awareness of implementing policies.

Study and Revise the Trial Calculation Plan

After unifying the cadres' thinking, the Party branch, with the help of Sui Rongqing, elected the Party branch secretary He Lianwang, five team leaders, and three old farmers to form a "Three Guarantees and One Reward" handling committee through democratic elections. Through field estimation of production and verification of yields, they formulated a "Three Guarantees and One Reward" handling plan, and then submitted it to the masses for line-by-line discussion. The masses then proposed revision opinions, and the plan was finalized. For example, the second team had 28 mu of new variety experimental fields. Due to a lack of experience, the production target was not achieved. The "Three Guarantees and One Reward" handling committee suggested that the team should bear some responsibility. The commune members raised different views during the discussion. The "Three Guarantees and One Reward" handling committee discussed everyone's opinions and decided to modify the original handling method and revised the production target for these 28 mu of fields. Reasonable adjustments were also made to unreasonable production guarantees between crops. After repeated discussions and revisions by the masses, a trial calculation plan was finally compiled. The total grain output of the entire team is expected to increase by 17.5% compared with 1959, and most teams can receive surplus grain.

Everyone Cares About the Collective

After the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" trial calculation plan was announced, it greatly mobilized the production enthusiasm of the commune members. Commune members are more concerned about the collective and cherish the fruits of their labor. The first team with surplus production lacked more than 50 sweet potato mats. Deputy team leader Chen Mingchang immediately led the commune members to the mountains to cut bamboo. Thirty-six commune members worked in the fields during the day and repaired agricultural tools at night. Guan Youlin, the leader of the second team, which could not achieve surplus production in the trial calculation, convened a team meeting on the evening of the day the plan was announced. At the meeting, the commune members were determined to become stronger and resolved to strive for surplus production through careful harvesting and threshing. They studied measures to increase production and formulated technical operating procedures for careful harvesting and threshing of various crops, requiring 10 more jin of grain per mu of late rice, 80 more jin per mu of sweet potatoes, and 15 more jin per mu of soybeans. After inspection of the 86 mu of late rice and 40 mu of sweet potatoes that have already been harvested by the entire production team, the rice has basically achieved no ears left in the fields and no grains lost in the drying ground. The sweet potatoes have also basically achieved complete digging and picking: no piece is lost, and no piece is rotten.

After Sui Rongqing set an example, the County Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Houpu Team with the participation of commune agricultural secretaries and some brigade and production team cadres, and comprehensively promoted the experience of Houpu Team.

### 书记带头认真执行“三包一奖”  人人细收细打队队力争超产  丽水县委书记协助基层干部坚决执行政策

    书记带头认真执行“三包一奖”
    人人细收细打队队力争超产
    丽水县委书记协助基层干部坚决执行政策
    本报讯　浙江丽水县城关公社后铺生产队干部在县委负责同志的帮助下，提高了执行党的政策的自觉性，坚持执行“三包一奖”制度，大大调动了群众细收细打的积极性。
    秋收开始前，县委第一书记隋荣庆到后铺生产队工作，发现生产队干部中对如何又快又好地完成秋收任务有两种不同的看法，一部分人认为在党中央大办农业、大办粮食的伟大号召的鼓舞下，只要订个秋收计划，拟就一套精打细收的技术规程，然后把任务分配下去，就可以完成任务；另一种人认为，今年秋收的任务重、时间紧，只有认真执行党的政策，坚持“三包一奖”制度，充分调动社员的积极性，才能把秋收工作搞好。
    总结经验提高认识
    为了统一干部的思想认识，隋荣庆首先引导干部总结了执行“三包一奖”制度的经验。这个队去年对“三包一奖”制度执行得较好，今年春花、早稻都长得很好，但在夏收夏种中，由于没有严格执行“三包一奖”制度，虽然当时也曾讨论过一套细收细打的操作规程，有的社员却不重视，没有认真执行，使细收细打工作受到了影响。这个生动的事实深刻地教育了干部，使大家认识到要领导好秋收，就必须认真执行党的政策，坚持“三包一奖”制度，把群众的积极性充分调动起来。
      广泛听取社员意见
    在总结了执行“三包一奖”制度的经验以后，隋荣庆又引导干部去听取社员的意见，看看社员对于“三包一奖”制度究竟是怎样看法。经过深入了解，他们发现不论是增产多的队或增产不多的队，都迫切要求坚决执行“三包一奖”制度。增产多的队社员看到今年大丰收，迫切要求知道到底有多少超产粮可得；增产不多的队也希望早些公布“三包一奖”试算方案，他们说：是奖是赔早知道，现在还可再向田里要。这样，干部更看到了坚持“三包一奖”制度是广大社员的迫切要求，提高了执行政策的自觉性。
    研究修正试算方案
    在统一了干部的思想认识以后，党支部在隋荣庆的帮助下，经过民主选举，由党支部书记何连旺、五个小队长和三个老农民组成“三包一奖”处理委员会，通过田间估产，核定产量，制订“三包一奖”处理方案，然后交给群众逐条讨论，由群众提出修正意见，最后定案。如第二小队有二十八亩新品种试验田，因为缺乏经验，没有实现包产指标，“三包一奖”处理委员会意见是要小队负一部分责任，社员在讨论时提出了不同看法，“三包一奖”处理委员会讨论了大家的意见，决定修改原来的处理办法，修正了这二十八亩田的包产指标。对于作物与作物之间包产不合理的地方，也作了合理处理。这样经过群众反复讨论，再三修正，最后编造了试算方案，全队粮食总产量预计比1959年增产17.5％，多数小队可以分到超产粮。
    人人关心集体
    “三包一奖”试算方案公布后，大大调动了社员的生产积极性。社员更加关心集体，珍惜劳动果实。超产的第一小队缺少番薯帘五十多张，副小队长陈明昌立即带社员上山砍毛竹，三十六个社员白天田间劳动，晚上修制农具。在试算中不能超产的第二小队队长管友林，公布方案的当天晚上就召开小队会议，会上，社员们发愤图强，决心从精打细收中争取超产。他们研究了增产措施，制订了各项作物精收细打的技术操作规程，要求每亩晚稻多收十斤粮，每亩番薯多收八十斤，每亩黄豆多收十五斤。全生产队已收的八十六亩晚稻和四十亩番薯，经过检查，水稻基本上做到田里不留穗，晒场不丢粒，番薯也基本上做到掘光拾光：一块不丢、一块不烂。
    隋荣庆作出样子以后，县委就在后铺队召开了有公社农业书记和部分大队、生产队干部参加的现场会议，全面推广了后铺队的经验。
