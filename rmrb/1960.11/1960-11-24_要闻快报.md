Seventy Thousand Young Workers Advance into the "June 1st" Year

At the beginning of this year, the province of Hebei launched a campaign among young workers: "Support agriculture as vanguards, complete tasks with the strength of many, produce a wide variety of products in a Great Leap Forward, and everyone advance into the 'June 1st' year ahead of schedule." This competition has now ended. According to preliminary statistics from Tangshan, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Handan and other cities, more than 74,600 young people and 2,441 youth collectives have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their quotas. At the Yuehua Glass Factory in Qinhuangdao, more than 300 young workers have achieved productivity levels of one person doing the work of two to one and a half people.

Short-Distance Transportation Seeks Labor from Reformed Tools

The short-distance transportation departments in Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province, are vigorously building and reforming transportation tools, advancing towards the trainization of ox carts and horse carts. Since June this year, the prefecture has newly built more than 77,000 animal-powered vehicles, rubber-wheeled carts, and wooden boats, and has also modified and assembled a large number of animal-drawn trains, trailers, four-wheeled vehicles, and sailboat vehicles. The vigorous reform of transportation tools has greatly saved the labor force used for short-distance transportation in this prefecture. The number of people engaged in short-distance transportation in January was 69,000, which has now been reduced to 38,000. However, the actual freight volume has increased from 610,000 tons to more than 1.1 million tons.

Zhangdian Station Develops Piggyback Transportation

Zhangdian Railway Station on the Jiaoji Line is making every effort to use freight cars, cabooses, baggage cars, and empty cars to carry scattered materials. In order to accurately grasp the flow of vehicles and goods, they have adopted a three-way connection method: 1. Contact the dispatcher to understand the quantity and destination of trains arriving at the station; 2. Contact the conductor to understand the position of heavy cars staying at the station; 3. Contact the car number clerk to understand the loading situation of the trains. In the past ten months, the station has piggybacked more than 60,000 tons of materials, saving more than 2,000 railcars.

The Nanling First, Second, and Third Coal Mines under the Pingshi Mining Bureau in Guangdong Province have adopted revolutionary measures, redeploying cadres promoted from technical workers back to the forefront of production, effectively strengthening the leadership of the work groups. To date, the three coal mines have extracted 168 people to directly participate in production in the work groups, with most people serving as squad leaders and deputy squad leaders.

Old Cotton Clothes Dismantled, Washed, Dyed, and Sewn in One-Stop Service

The new service method is characterized by: customers' old cotton clothes are dismantled, washed, sewn, mended, dyed, carded, turned over, and altered by one shop in a one-stop service. In the past three months, they have dismantled, washed, and renovated more than 1,800 pieces of old cotton clothing for customers, bringing great convenience to the masses.
