    Artistic Originality and the Flourishing of Diverse Arts
    Xie Fan

    From the perspective of literary history, a good literary work always circulates for a very long time, possessing a strong artistic vitality, and its readers and admirers often extend beyond its own era. This is also the case with contemporary literary works. Good works always attract readers to revisit them time and again. There are, of course, many subjective and objective reasons for this phenomenon. If we analyze them simply, they mainly boil down to two aspects: Firstly, the content of the work has a profound educational significance and ideological value for the reader, which is the main aspect. Secondly, there is the artistic enjoyment of beauty. This aspect is of course closely related to the former and is subject to its constraints. One cannot evaluate the artistic enjoyment of beauty in isolation from the content of the work, otherwise, one will be deceived. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "Some things that are fundamentally reactionary in politics may also have some artistry. The more reactionary a work is in content, the more artistic it is, the more it can poison the people, and the more it should be rejected." However, for excellent literary works, these two aspects should achieve harmony and unity, or achieve harmony and unity at a certain height. That is to say, an excellent literary work should not only be profound in thought and reflect life with its unique depth, but also have a corresponding beautiful artistic form and independent creation in art, giving readers a fresh artistic enjoyment of beauty that is different from other works. Readers often praise writers and works that can meet these requirements for their artistic originality. I think that the reason why excellent works can have a long artistic vitality, besides their profound ideological content, is that this artistic originality is also the reason why people "never tire of reading" them. Comrade Zhou Yang said: "The life of the people is inherently rich and colorful, and the literature and art that reflect the life of the people should also be rich and colorful... Readers, audiences, and listeners of the new era love to read fiery works that reflect the lives and struggles of their contemporaries, and they also love to watch captivating historical and legendary stories on stage; they love to listen to stirring battle marches, and they also like beautiful and healthy lyrical music and lyrical dance. The new era needs more magnificent revolutionary historical paintings, revolutionary genre paintings, and figure paintings, but should new styles of landscape paintings and flower-and-bird paintings not also have their place in our art garden? People need invigoration and joy in their spiritual lives. As long as it does not violate the six political criteria stipulated by Comrade Mao Zedong in 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People,' the most important of which is that it does not violate the socialist road and the leadership of the Communist Party, artistic works of various forms, themes, and styles can be developed." ("The Road of Socialist Literature and Art in Our Country") This is the best explanation of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and is also the most enthusiastic encouragement for revolutionary literary and artistic workers to carry out creative artistic activities.
    The proposal of the Party's policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom is based on the requirements of the revolutionary era (this is the main aspect), and it is also a scientific generalization of the laws of literary and artistic development. As mentioned above, in literary history, whether the artistic vitality of a literary work is long-lasting, whether it has artistic originality, and whether it can give people new artistic enjoyment of beauty are also very important reasons. My deepest feeling in this regard comes from the circulation of classical Chinese novels. The legacy of long novels from the Yuan and Ming dynasties onwards, which constitute the mainstream of modern literary history, is vast, but strictly speaking, the number of works that can withstand the test of time and are still loved by the majority of readers today is not that large. In terms of first-class works, there are only a few works such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Journey to the West," "Dream of the Red Chamber," and "The Scholars."
    Why can these works have long artistic vitality? Of course, the most important reason is still their content, but do they also have their own different creations in art? I am afraid they do. With just a slight comparison, it can be found that they do have independent creations in art and enrich the treasury of our literary heritage with their respective artistic characteristics. "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is so good at depicting the changes in the complex political situation and at vividly portraying the influential figures on the feudal political stage in these changes. And "Water Margin" is so good at highlighting the character of its revolutionary peasant heroes in the sharp class struggle. Although "Journey to the West" is a novel of gods and demons with extremely rich fantasies, the images of its gods and demons heroes are entirely created using romantic techniques. However, from its realism, its world of gods and demons is clearly a transformation of real social relations and is full of strong realistic vitality. Moreover, in the creation of its gods and demons images, it is so good at accurately grasping their physiological characteristics to set off and highlight their personalities. "Dream of the Red Chamber" is a history of the rise and fall of a feudal family. It does not have the broad struggle background of the first three works, but it must be admitted that the development of classical long novels to "Dream of the Red Chamber" is its artistic peak. When people praised its successful creation of artistic images, they said that its characters of different personalities were like "carp crossing the river." "The Scholars" is a completely different work. Its pungent satire and profound and vivid comedy scenes are a huge contribution to China's traditional satirical literature.
    They are so different. Not only are the themes different, the styles are different, but even the language, structure, artistic descriptions, and expressive techniques of the characters have different characteristics and unique creations. With their various unmistakable and irreplaceable characteristics and creations, they stand on the milestone of the development of Chinese literary history, competing for beauty and never withering. These characteristics and creations are all significantly imprinted with the characteristics of the era in which the works were produced, the characteristics of the writer's personal thoughts, but they also clearly express the differences in the writer's artistic creation personality. Studying these differences and exploring their social, class, personal, and traditional inheritance factors and context will help us critically accept this heritage (unfortunately, there is too little research in this area).
    Of course, if this can also be regarded as a "hundred flowers blooming" in literary history, then this "hundred flowers blooming" is only the result of natural selection, and they are all products of the feudal era. Both ideologically and artistically, they have the limitations of that era and even backward and reactionary factors, and are not the same in nature as our hundred flowers blooming of literature and art, and cannot be compared in the same way. However, in terms of the longevity of their artistic vitality, they do have certain inspirations for us, that is to say, their long circulation shows that the works loved by the people are rich and colorful. People not only love and select excellent works from the ideological content of the works, but also from the artistic style and artistic charm of the works. Our writers and artists must strive to practice the Party's orientation of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom in order to meet the people's rich and colorful requirements for literature and art, greatly develop the ability of artistic originality, and make our socialist and communist literary and artistic garden bloom with more distinctive and splendid flowers. Naturally, the ability of artistic originality cannot be obtained by sitting in a room. Especially in the socialist and communist era, it requires rich literary and artistic cultivation, but it also requires rich life experiences. If we leave the fertile soil of the people and the fiery struggle, and leave the broadest and richest source of life, how can we open up distinctive and splendid flowers?

    艺术独创和百花齐放
    谢帆
    从文学史上来看，一部好的文学作品总是流传得很久很久，艺术生命力很强，阅读和欣赏它的人往往超出它的时代。就当代文学作品来看也是这样。凡是好的作品总是吸引读者一次再次地去看它。构成这种现象的主客观原因当然很多，如果简单分析起来，主要的也无非是两个方面：其一，是作品的内容对读者有深刻的教育意义和思想价值，这是主要的方面；其二，是艺术上的美的享受，这个方面当然和前者有密切的关联，而且是要受前者的制约。不能离开作品的内容孤立地评价它的艺术上的美的享受，否则就会上当。毛泽东同志曾经说过：“有些政治上根本反动的东西，也可能有某种艺术性。内容愈反动的作品又愈带艺术性，就愈能毒害人民，就愈应该排斥。”但是，对于优秀的文学作品来说，这两方面应该是取得谐和一致的，或者是在一定高度上取得谐和一致。也就是说，一部优秀的文学作品，不仅要思想深刻，反映生活有其独到的深度，而且要有相应的优美的艺术形式，在艺术上也有独立的创造，给读者以艺术上不同于其他作品的新鲜的美的享受。读者对于能满足这种要求的作家和作品，往往称赞他（它）们有艺术上的独创性。我想优秀的作品所以能有长久的艺术生命力，除去它的深刻的思想内容，这艺术上的独创性，也是使人“百看不厌”的原因。周扬同志说：“人民的生活本来是丰富多采的，反映人民生活的文学艺术也应该丰富多彩……新时代的读者、观众和听众爱读反映同时代人的生活和斗争的火辣辣的作品，也爱看舞台上演出的引人入胜的历史和传说的故事；爱听动人心弦的战斗进行曲，也喜欢优美而健康的抒情音乐和抒情舞蹈。新时代需要有更多壮美的革命历史画、革命风俗画和人物画，但是新风格的山水画和花鸟画，在我们的画苑中，难道不应当同样有它们的地位吗？人们在精神生活上需要振奋，也需要愉悦。只要不违背毛泽东同志在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中所规定的六项政治标准，最主要的就是只要不违反社会主义的道路和共产党的领导，各种形式、题材和风格的艺术作品都可以得到发展。”（《我国社会主义文学艺术的道路》）这是关于党的百花齐放政策的最好的说明，也是对革命文学艺术家进行创造性的艺术活动的最热情的鼓励。
    党的百花齐放的政策的提出，一方面是根据革命时代的要求（这是主要的），另方面也是对文学艺术发展规律的科学概括。正如上面所说，在文学史上，文学作品的艺术生命力的是否长久，艺术方面有无独创性，能否给人以新的美的享受，也是其中一个很重要的原因。我国古典长篇小说的流传，给我这方面的感受最深。元、明以来作为近古文学史主流的一脉的长篇小说的遗产是浩如烟海的，但是，能够经得起时间的考验流传下来直到今天还为广大读者所喜爱的，严格地说来，为数也不是那么多。以第一流的作品来看，也不过只有《三国演义》、《水浒》、《西游记》、《红楼梦》、《儒林外史》等几部作品。
    为什么这几部作品能够有长久的艺术生命力呢？当然最主要还在于它们的内容，但是，是不是在艺术上也有它们各自不同的创造呢？恐怕是有的。只要稍微比较一下，就会发现，它们在艺术上确实都有独立的创造，以各自不同的艺术特色丰富了我们的文学遗产的宝库。《三国演义》是那样善于描写复杂的政治风云的变幻，善于在这种政治风云变幻中，传神地描绘那些封建政治舞台上的风云人物。而《水浒》却是那样善于在尖锐的阶级斗争中突出它的革命农民英雄的性格。《西游记》虽然是一本神魔小说，有着极其丰富的幻想，它的神魔英雄的形象完全是用浪漫主义手法创作出来的，但是，从它的现实性来看，它的神魔世界分明是现实社会关系的幻化，富有强烈的现实生命力。而且在它的神魔形象的创造上，它又是那样善于真实地把握它们的生理特点，来烘托、突出它们的性格。《红楼梦》是一部封建家族的兴衰史，它没有前三部作品那样广阔的斗争背景，但是，又不能不承认，长篇古典小说发展到《红楼梦》，却是它的艺术上的高峰。人们在称赞它的艺术形象创造得成功的时候，曾说它的不同性格的人物如“过江之鲫”。《儒林外史》又完全是另外一种作品，它的辛辣的讽刺和深邃生动的喜剧画面，是对我国传统的讽刺文学的一个巨大贡献。
    它们是那样的不同。不仅题材不同，风格不同，甚至语言、结构、艺术描写和人物性格的表现手法，都有不同的特色，独到的创造，以它们的各种无法混淆和不可代替的特色和创造，屹立在我国文学史的发展里程上，争奇斗妍，永不雕谢。这种特色和创造，都显著地烙印着作品产生的时代的特点，作家个人的思想的特点，但也鲜明地表现了作家艺术创作个性的差异，研究这种差异，探索它们的社会的、阶级的、个人的以及对传统继承的各方面的原因和脉络，将会有助于我们批判地接受这份遗产（可惜这方面的研究太少了）。
    当然，如果说这也算是文学史上的“百花齐放”，那么，这种“百花齐放”只是一种自然淘汰的成果，而且它们都是封建时代的产物，无论思想上、艺术上都带有那个时代的局限、甚至落后反动的因素，和我们的百花齐放的文艺，不是同一性质，也不能作相同的比较。不过，就它们的艺术生命力的长久来说，它们对于我们却是有一定的启示的，那就是说，它们的长久流传，说明了人民所喜爱的作品，是丰富多采的。人民不仅从作品的思想内容上、也从作品的艺术风格、艺术魅力去喜爱和选择优秀的作品。我们的文学家、艺术家，要满足人民对于文学艺术的丰富多采的要求，就必须努力实践党的文艺的工农兵方向和百花齐放的方针，大大发挥艺术的独创能力，使我们的社会主义共产主义的文艺百花园，开放出更多富有特色的灿烂的花朵。自然，艺术的独创能力，并不是坐在屋子里就能取得的，特别是在社会主义、共产主义的时代，它需要丰富的文艺的修养，但也更需要丰富的生活体验，离开了人民群众和火热斗争的肥沃土壤，离开了最广大最丰富的生活源泉，又怎么能开放出富有特色的灿烂的花朵呢？
