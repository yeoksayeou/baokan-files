Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Washington dispatch: The US Treasury Department announced on the 2nd that in just one day last Friday, the value of US gold outflows reached over 45 million US dollars.

The situation shows that US gold outflows are becoming faster and more intense. According to the same announcement from the US Treasury Department, the total amount of US gold outflows from the beginning of this year to last Friday was 1,004 million US dollars, of which 905 million US dollars flowed out during the period from June 30th to last Friday.

Due to the large outflow of gold, the current US gold reserves have fallen to just over 18.4 billion US dollars. That is to say, if we deduct the 11.7 billion US dollars of "statutory gold" that the US government cannot use as currency collateral, the US currently has only 6.7 billion US dollars of "free gold" that it can dispose of. However, US Treasury Secretary Anderson said on the 1st that foreign short-term deposits in the United States currently amount to 17.5 billion US dollars. If these depositors withdraw half of their deposits and exchange them for gold, the US gold reserves will be insufficient to cope with the situation.

Although the gold rush in the capitalist world gold market is not as intense as it was a few days ago, it has not subsided. Although the price of gold per ounce has fallen back from its peak of 41 US dollars, it is still much higher than the price before the rush (a little over 35 US dollars). This situation is inseparable from the weak state of US gold reserves. According to Reuters on the 2nd, after a slight drop in the London market gold price on the 1st, it rose again to over 36 US dollars on the 2nd, reaching a maximum of 36.5 US dollars. The news said that the "market looked tight" on the 2nd... the demand for gold was quite large. The existing supply can only meet about half of the demand." The news also said that "some gold rush activities occurred again in the Paris gold market" on the 2nd.

The US government is currently very distressed and nervous about the continued development of the trend of selling US dollars and snapping up gold. In the past few days, Eisenhower, Treasury Secretary Anderson, and Commerce Secretary Mueller have come out one after another to claim that the US dollar will not depreciate. However, what is playing a role in the capitalist world market is not these empty words intended to reassure people, but the reality of the US financial crisis and the deterioration of the entire economy. After continuously putting pressure on Western European countries, US Treasury Secretary Anderson once again loudly appealed to them on the evening of the 1st to help the United States support the situation. Anderson is very worried that foreign creditors with deposits in the United States will further "become suspicious of the US dollar." He said, "They may withdraw gold or US dollars within a few days." Anderson anxiously brought out the big hat of the "interests of the free world" to pressure other Western countries. He said that the US dollar "is the pillar of the free world's financial system." If other capitalist countries withdraw their short-term deposits in the United States, the funds for everything that the entire "free world hopes to do will be reduced," and "our ability to maintain the defense capabilities of the free world here and abroad will be weakened."

    美国黄金外流速度越来越快
    西欧抢购黄金风潮继续发展
    美国政府忧心忡忡要求西欧国家帮忙撑持局面
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国财政部2日宣布，在上星期五一天里，美国外流的黄金价值就高达四千五百多万美元。
    情况表明，美国黄金外流正在越来越快，越来越激烈。根据美国财政部的同一公告，从今年年初到上星期五，美国黄金外流的总数是十亿零四千万美元，而其中九亿零五百万美元是在6月30日到上星期五的期间流出的。
    由于黄金大量外流，美国目前的黄金储备已下降到只有一百八十四亿美元多一点。这就是说，如果扣除美国政府作为通货保证金不能动用的一百十七亿美元的“法定黄金”以外，美国可以支配的“自由黄金”目前只有六十七亿多美元。而美国财政部长安德逊1日说，外国目前在美国拥有的短期存款一项即达一百七十五亿美元。如果这些存户提取了他们的存款的一半并兑换黄金，美国的黄金储备便将不足应付。
    目前资本主义世界黄金市场上的抢购风潮虽然没有前些日子那么剧烈，却始终没有平息。每盎斯黄金的价格虽然已从四十一美元的最高峰回降，却仍然比风潮前的价格（三十五美元多一点）高出不少。这种状况是同美国黄金储备的虚弱状况分不开的。据路透社2日报道，伦敦市场的黄金价格在1日稍为回落以后，2日又上升到三十六美元以上，最高达三十六点五美元。消息说，2日的“市场看来很紧……黄金的需求量相当大。现有的供应只能满足需求的一半左右。”消息还说，2日“巴黎黄金市场上又出现了一些抢购活动”。
    美国政府目前对抛出美元、抢购黄金的风潮继续发展，十分苦恼和紧张。这几天，艾森豪威尔、财政部长安德逊、商务部长米勒连接出来声称美元不会贬值，但是，在资本主义世界市场上起作用的，却不是这些企图安慰人心的空洞言词，而是美国财政金融危机和整个经济恶化的现实。在不断对西欧国家施加压力以后，美国财政部长安德逊1日晚上又再次大声呼吁要它们帮助美国撑持局面。安德逊十分担心在美国有存款的外国债权人会进一步“对美元产生怀疑”。他说，“他们很可能在几天之内提取黄金或美元”。安德逊情急地搬出了“自由世界的利益”的大帽子来压其他西方国家。他说，美元“是自由世界金融系统的支柱”，如果其他资本主义国家把它们在美国的短期存款提走，那么整个“自由世界希望做的一切事情的款项就将减少”，“我们在这里和国外维持自由世界的防御能力就将削弱”。
