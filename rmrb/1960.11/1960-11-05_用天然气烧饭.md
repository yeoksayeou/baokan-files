    Cooking with Natural Gas
    In our Yong'an Commune, there was a legend about "fire wells." The commune party committee interviewed some old commune members and confirmed that this legend had a basis in reality. They then organized a natural gas drilling team and began drilling in the area of the eighth production team of the Xinqiao Production Brigade. Now, a natural gas well has been drilled. This natural gas well is very useful. As long as a hose is inserted into the wellhead and the gas is piped to the canteen, it can be lit to cook food. The food for more than 130 people can be cooked in two hours. In addition, this natural gas can also be used for lighting. This production team has used this natural gas well for 160 days, saving 56,000 catties of firewood. Using natural gas for cooking is clean, hygienic, and fast, and it is welcomed by the commune members. Commune member Huang Wanrong said: "The People's Commune is truly good, thanks to the good leadership of the Party. Opening a well on the ground is very useful, lighting lamps and cooking food is great!"

    用天然气烧饭
    我们永安公社有过关于“火井”的传说，公社党委访问了一些老社员，证实这种传说是有根据的，就组织了一个天然气钻探队，在新乔生产大队第八生产小队的地区开始钻探，现在已钻探出一口天然气井。这口天然气井，用处很大。只要用皮管子插入井口，把气引到食堂，就可以点燃烧饭，一百三十多个人的饭两小时就烧好了。此外，还可以用这种天然气点灯照明。这个生产小队利用这口天然气井一百六十天，就节约了烧柴五万六千斤。利用天然气做饭，干净卫生，做饭快，受到社员的欢迎。社员黄万荣说：“人民公社真正好，感谢党的好领导，地面开井用处大，点灯烧饭呱呱叫。”
