Commune Members, Acting as Masters, Discuss Autumn Planting Plans
The ChunGuang Production Team's Autumn Planting is Solid, Fast, and Excellent

"One purlin cannot make a house; doing a good job in anything requires relying on the masses." These are the two favorite sayings of Comrade Ding KeFa, the Party Branch Secretary of the ChunGuang Production Team in Maozui Commune, Mianyang County, Hubei Province. He consults with the masses in everything he does, honestly learning from them, and takes the lead in working diligently. It is with these two approaches that he has made the team's autumn planting production movement vigorous, solid, fast in progress, and excellent in quality, making it a red banner for autumn planting production in the county.

Planting According to Local Conditions
In September of this year, after a commune member meeting on how to improve autumn planting, Lao Ding stayed behind to talk with his closest friend, Deng YouDian. Lao Deng said, "To do a good job in autumn planting, we need to rely on everyone for three things: first, the 'three guarantees' must be meticulously implemented; second, let us arrange crop rotations according to the soil quality of the fields; and third, let us arrange the labor force." Deng YouDian continued, "Like that piece of land in the Dengjia area, it's low-lying and sandy. Our ancestors have been planting barley there for generations. Last year, we planted wheat in order to have contiguous crops. If we switch back to barley this year, we can also catch up with early soybeans and interplant autumn millet, yielding more than 400 catties in three seasons, without a doubt." These words made Lao Ding both regretful and happy. Regretful because in the past, production leadership was too subjective; happy because Lao Deng spoke the minds of the commune members. So he mobilized all the team's cadres, on the one hand, humbly admitting past subjectivism to the commune members and listening to their criticisms; on the other hand, he let the commune members take charge of implementing the 'three guarantees.' Subsequently, the team held several more commune member meetings, democratically deciding on the 'three guarantees' grades for each small team and the total output of grain and rapeseed, meticulously guaranteeing them to the small team, and humbly listening to the commune members' opinions to arrange crop areas and rotations. When the commune members of the Eighth Team were discussing planting according to local conditions and arranging rotations, there was a twenty-mu piece of black sandy land that used to be planted with wheat. Poor peasant commune member Deng YouXiang said, "That piece of land is hardened and not suitable for wheat, only for broad beans." Some commune members said, "The terrain there is low, and broad beans are afraid of waterlogging." Lao Deng said, "Now that ditches have been dug, planting broad beans this season and early millet next season will provide a foundation for fertile fields in the future." In the end, everyone agreed to plant broad beans according to Lao Deng's suggestion. The commune members of each team, in this way, comprehensively considered how to plant more, achieve high yields, and consider issues such as soil quality, rotations, fertilizer, firewood, operational conflicts, and labor conditions when arranging planting areas. As a result of this arrangement, the entire team adjusted the planting of crops unsuitable for soil quality in twelve locations, totaling 432 mu of land.

Jointly Planning Major Affairs
When sowing began, the cadres of the ChunGuang Production Team engaged in a heated discussion. Some advocated for sowing as early as possible in the season, while others advocated for plowing after the frost, each with their own reasons. Comrade Ding KeFa said, "This is a matter of hundreds of thousands of catties of grain. We cannot be careless. It is best to consult with the commune members."

Lao Ding found old man Deng XueChun to ask about the sowing season. Old man Deng said, "Early White Dew, late Frost's Descent, the Autumn Equinox and Cold Dew are just right. Now that White Dew has just passed, and the Autumn Equinox is just a few days away, we can sow on the 17th or 18th (of September); this year, the 18th of the twelfth lunar month is the beginning of spring, so it's better to sow earlier." Lao Ding is a person who does things reliably. He brought together the trusted people that the cadres had found and held a meeting of advisors. After discussion, everyone agreed with old man Deng's opinion. Then Lao Ding took the old farmers' opinions to the commune members for separate discussions. More than 400 commune members participated in the discussion, analyzing more than 30 typical cases. Finally, they came to a conclusion: in the past, those who sowed during White Dew reduced their yields, and those who sowed after Frost's Descent also missed the season; only sowing during the Autumn Equinox and Cold Dew was the best, with stable yields.

On September 18th, the entire team mobilized more than 300 people to start interplanting broad beans in the cotton fields.

Speed First
Just as interplanting in the cotton fields began, Guan GuiYing, a female commune member of the First Team, said, "Using hoes to sow is too shallow and slow, and we can't sow even a third of a mu in a day." Lao Ding, who was sowing in the fields with the commune members, heard this and thought to himself that this was indeed a problem. He calculated that the entire team had only 300 laborers for autumn planting. At this rate, it would take three or forty days to finish sowing, which would miss the season. So, he found commune members Deng XueChun, Ding XingYuan, and team leader Qin XinPan to jointly study the sowing progress and quality. After everyone's repeated experiments, they jointly proposed a method of using cattle for rotary tillage in the cotton fields. First pick the cotton, then sow, plowing and sowing while dividing the rows. This way, the cotton is not damaged, and sowing is faster. In five hours, one cow and four people planted 4.1 mu of land, and the quality was also very good. This method was quickly promoted throughout the team, and in four days, 1,520 mu of broad beans were sown.

Lao Ding consults with the masses in everything he does, finds trusted people when encountering difficulties, and humbly asks for advice from everyone when he doesn't know something, always staying with the masses. During this autumn planting, he stayed in the Ninth Team for half a month, worked eight standard workdays, created three model fields, and made five trusted friends.

Under Lao Ding's influence, all the team's cadres have learned a set of mass line working methods and have their own trusted friends. From the beginning of autumn planting to the end of October, all twelve team leaders and seven team cadres each took charge of a work group, going to work before everyone else and leaving after everyone else, plowing the fields during the day and studying work at night. Each person averaged more than twenty standard workdays. The commune members' labor enthusiasm is very high, and they have taken the initiative in autumn harvesting and autumn planting everywhere.

    社员当家作主商定秋种计划
    春光生产队秋播扎扎实实又快又好
    “一根檩子搭不起一个屋，办好一件事，不依靠群众是不行的。”这是湖北沔阳县毛咀公社春光生产队党支部书记丁克发同志最喜欢说的两句话。他遇事跟群众商量，老老实实做群众的学生；扎扎实实地带头干。他就是凭这两手，使全队的秋播生产运动，轰轰烈烈、扎扎实实，进度快，质量好，成为全县秋播生产的红旗。
    因地种植
    今年9月，老丁在一次如何搞好秋播问题的社员大会之后，留下一个最知心的朋友邓有典谈心。老邓说：“要搞好秋播，要依大家三件事：第一，三包要搞的挨筋拌骨；第二，让我们按田的土质安排茬口；第三，要依我们安排劳力。”邓有典接着说：“像邓家片那方田，低洼又是灰沙地，我们几代都是种大麦，去年搞作物连片种上了小麦。今年要是改种大麦，还可以赶上早黄豆，套种秋粟子，三季收个四百多斤，是跑不掉的。”这一席话说得老丁又是痛心，又是欢喜。痛心的是过去领导生产太主观了；欢喜的是老邓说出了社员们的内心话。于是他发动全队所有干部，一方面虚心向社员检讨过去的主观主义，听取社员们的批评；一方面放手发动社员搞好三包。接着全队又接连召开了几次社员会，民主决定了各小队的三包等级和粮食、油菜的总产，挨筋拌骨地包到小队，虚心听取社员的意见来安排作物面积和茬口。八小队的社员在讨论因地种植、安排茬口的时候，有一块二十亩的黑沙片，过去是种小麦，贫农社员邓有香说：“那一块土板结，不适合种小麦，只能种蚕豆。”有的社员说：“那里地势低，蚕豆怕渍。”老邓说：“现在已经开了沟，这一季种蚕豆，下一季种早粟，以后就有肥田底子。”最后大家同意照老邓的意见种上了蚕豆。各队的社员们，就这样把如何多种高产多收与照顾土质、茬口、肥料、烧柴、操作矛盾、劳力情况等问题，在安排种植面积时，一起作了周密的安排。全队通过这样安排的结果，共调整了种植作物不合土质的地片十二处，共四百三十二亩田。
    共谋大计
    播种开始，春光生产队的干部开展了一场热烈的讨论。有的主张播种季节越早越好，有的主张霜降以后再动犁，各有各的道理。丁克发同志说：“这是几十万斤粮食的大事，我们不能马虎从事，最好去找社员们商量商量”。
    老丁找到了邓学纯老汉，请教播种季节的问题。邓老汉说：“白露早霜降迟、秋分寒露正当时。现在白露刚过，再过几天就是秋分了，十七、八号就可以播了（指九月）；今年腊月十八就开春，早点播种好些。”老丁是作牢靠事的人，又把干部们所找到的知心人，请在一起，开众师座谈会，经过商讨，大家都同意邓老汉的意见。接着老丁又把老农们的意见，拿到社员中分头讨论，参加讨论的四百多个社员，七嘴八舌，分析了三十多个典型材料，最后一碰头，得出一个结论：过去凡是白露播种的减了产，霜降以后播的也错过了季节，只有秋分、寒露播种最好，产量稳当。
    9月18日，全队就出动三百多人，开始了棉田套种蚕豆。
    速度第一
    棉田套种刚开始，一小队女社员关贵英说：“用锄头播，挖的浅，搞的慢，一天播不到三分田。”在田里和社员一起播种的老丁，听在耳里，心里想这的确是个问题。他谋算了一下：全队搞秋播的只有三百个劳力，按照这样的速度播下去，要三、四十天才能播完，这就误了季节。于是，他又找到社员邓学纯、丁兴元和小队长秦心盘，共同研究播种进度和质量。经过大家三番两次的试验，共同提出了棉田用牛套耕的办法。先拣花，后播种，边分行边耕边种，这样，既不坏棉花，又播得快。五个钟头，一头牛四个人种了四亩一分田，质量也很好。这个方法很快就在全队推广了，四天时间播完了一千五百二十亩蚕豆。
    老丁遇事和群众商量，碰到困难找知心人，不会就虚心向大家请教，时时刻刻都和群众在一起。这次秋播，他在九小队住了半个月，做了八个多标准工日，办了三种样板田，交了五个知心朋友。
    全队的干部，在老丁的影响下，都学会了一套群众路线的工作方法，都有自己的知心朋友。从秋播开始到10月下旬，全队十二个小队长和七个队干部，人人都包了一个作业组，上工在前，放工在后，白天耕田，夜晚研究工作，每人平均做了二十多个标准工日。社员的劳动热情非常高，处处取得了秋收秋播的主动权。　　　（群声）
