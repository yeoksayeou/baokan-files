    Why do school Party committee secretaries and committee members need to go deep into the front lines of teaching? And what should they do after going deep into the front lines? Reading the news from Northwest University, people can draw some beneficial experiences.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in the article "Methods of Work of Party Committees": "The Party committee must not only 'grasp' the main tasks, but also 'grasp tightly'," because "grasping without tightening is equivalent to not grasping," and the work still cannot be done well. The main task of the school Party committee is to strengthen political and ideological and teaching business leadership and do a good job in teaching. To "grasp tightly" the teaching work, one must go deep into the front line of teaching. This is the same principle as that factory and rural Party committee comrades must go deep into the front lines of production to "grasp tightly" production work.
    To "grasp tightly" the teaching work, it is necessary to deeply understand and grasp the various specific problems of the teaching work, and to explore and master the laws of the teaching work. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "No matter what you do, if you do not understand the situation, its nature, its relationship with things outside of it, you will not know the laws of that thing, you will not know how to do it, and you will not be able to do that thing well." The same is true for teaching work. Only by understanding and mastering the laws of teaching work can we "grasp tightly" and lead the teaching work well. To understand, first, you must go to the front line of teaching, and second, after arriving at the front line, you must study hard yourself, and also be "not ashamed to ask." Things that you do not understand and do not know about, you must be good at asking teachers, students, and grassroots cadres, first be a student, then be a teacher. Xiao Keping, a member of the Standing Committee of the Northwest University Party Committee, did just that, which enabled him to go from not understanding the teaching of "Mathematical Analysis" to understanding the teaching of this course, and further discover the problems existing in the teaching of "Mathematical Analysis." He helped teachers learn to use dialectical materialism to analyze some of the principles in the course, thereby improving the quality of teaching.
    Another point that needs to be emphasized in the experience of Northwest University is the need to go deep into a department, a teaching and research group, a class, a school-run factory (or farm), personally participate in the teaching activities of a course or the production labor process of a workshop, specifically "dissect the sparrow," and gain direct experience from practice, and promptly discover and effectively help teachers summarize advanced experiences in teaching. As a result of Northwest University's persistence in doing so for several years, it has compiled many important experiences into forty-seven special reports. This is a considerable wealth, which will be very beneficial for continuously enriching leadership experience and continuously improving the quality of teaching.
    In short, experience has repeatedly proven that only by going deep can we "grasp tightly." Only by going deep into the front line of teaching can we "grasp tightly" and lead the teaching work well, promote the improvement of teaching quality, and promote the better implementation of the Party's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." Therefore, we must, like Northwest University, adhere to the principle of going deep into the front line of teaching as an important working method of the school Party committee.

    深入才能“抓紧”
    柏生
    学校党委书记和党委委员为什么需要深入教学第一线？深入第一线后又应该怎样做工作？读了西北大学的新闻，人们可以汲取一些有益的经验。
    毛泽东同志在“党委会的工作方法”一文中说：“党委对主要工作不但一定要‘抓’，而且一定要‘抓紧’”，因为“抓而不紧，等于不抓”，工作还是不能做好。学校党委的主要工作，就是加强政治思想和教学业务的领导，搞好教学工作。要“抓紧”教学工作，就得深入教学第一线。这同工厂和农村党委的同志要“抓紧”生产工作就得深入到生产第一线的道理是一样的。
    “抓紧”教学工作，就要对教学工作的各个具体问题深知熟解，就得摸索和掌握教学工作的规律。毛泽东同志教导我们：“不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事”。对于教学工作来说也是一样，只有懂得和掌握了教学工作的规律，才能“抓紧”领导好教学工作。要懂，第一就得到教学第一线，第二就是到了第一线后，自己要艰苦学习，还要“不耻下问”，不懂得和不了解的东西，要善于向教师、学生、基层干部请教，先做学生，再做先生。西北大学党委常委萧克平就是这样做的，因而使他从不懂“数学分析”的教学到懂得这门课的教学，并且进而发现了“数学分析”这门课教学上存在的问题，帮助教师学习运用辩证唯物论去分析课程中的一些原理，从而提高了教学质量。
    西北大学的经验中还有一点需要着重提出的，这就是需要深入到一个系、一个教研组、一个班级、一个校办工厂（或农场）中去，亲身参加一门课程的教学活动或一个车间的生产劳动过程，具体地“解剖麻雀”，自己从实践中取得直接经验，并且及时地发现和切实地帮助教师总结教学中的先进经验。西北大学几年来坚持这样做的结果，已经把很多重要的经验编写成四十七篇专题报告。这是一笔不小的财富，它对于不断丰富领导工作经验，不断提高教学工作质量，将会很有益处。
    总之，经验一再证明：深入才能“抓紧”，深入教学第一线，才能“抓紧”领导好教学工作，促进教学质量的提高，促进党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针得到更好的贯彻。因此，就要像西北大学一样，坚持把深入教学第一线作为学校党委的一条重要的工作方法。
