    "Five Workers" All Pitch In
    In addition to launching a mass campaign to accumulate fertilizer, our commune also organized transport workers, herders, feeders, road maintenance workers, and manure managers to collect fertilizer conveniently. All 340 carts in the commune, while transporting autumn harvest crops, also hauled soil for bedding. Each pig-raising household received a cartload of soil, adding over 94,000 jin of fertilizer. Herders, while herding, also collected fertilizer, accumulating 2.2 million jin already. They also ensured that the sheep did not lie down indiscriminately, prioritizing slopes and terraced fields to ensure the fertilizer didn't wash downhill. Feeders cleaned the pens once a day and added soil once a day, ensuring no fertilizer was lost, already accumulating 12 million jin of pen manure. Road maintenance workers demarcated road sections and were responsible for collecting manure on the roads. Manure managers, determined to be the best among the "five workers," adopted a "five (parts) soil," "two (parts) water," and "three (parts) fertilizer" mixed rapid composting method, improving both the quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulated.

    “五员”齐动手
    我们公社除了开展群众性的突击积肥运动外，还组织了运输员、放牧员、饲养员、养路员、粪便管理员就便积肥。全公社的三百四十辆大车，边拉秋收作物，边拉垫脚土，给每个养猪户拉了一车土，多积肥料九万四千多斤。放牧员，边放牧、边积肥，已积肥二百二十万斤；他们还做到了羊群不乱卧，首先卧山坡地和梯田，保证了肥不下山。饲养员一天清一次圈棚，一天垫一次土，保证粪肥不流失，已积圈肥一千二百万斤。养路员划定了路段，负责在公路上拾粪。粪便管理员，决心在“五员”中争第一，采用了“五（成）土”、“二（成）水”、“三（成）肥”混合快速沤肥法，提高了积肥的数量和质量。
