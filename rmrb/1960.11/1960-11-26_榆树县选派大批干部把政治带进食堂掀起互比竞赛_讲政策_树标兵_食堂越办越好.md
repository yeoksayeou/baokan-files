Changchun, November 25th. The Yushu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jilin Province, after organizing 2,270 cadres from the county, communes, and management areas to go deep into the canteens and serve as deputy administrators, promptly launched a competition between canteens, administrators, and cooks, vigorously publicizing policies and implementing them, so that the canteens are getting better and better.

The content of the competition is: good publicity and implementation of the Party's principles and policies; good planned use of grain and saving grain; good democratic management; good food adjustment and good life for commune members; good grain and vegetable storage and winter preparation work; good learning and promotion of advanced experience; good canteen family production; good stove reform and use; good canteen cleanliness and hygiene; strong mass viewpoint and good service attitude. On the tenth day of launching the competition, the county conducted the first inspection and evaluation, and there were 319 red flag model canteens, 358 model canteen administrators, 839 model cooks, and 494 model grain administrators, and a large number of canteen activists and catering experts emerged.

The Yushu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in the spirit of grasping production with one hand and life with the other, insists on implementing the leadership method of "politics entering the canteen and cadres entering the kitchen." In October, it selected more than 2,000 cadres at all levels to go deep into the canteens and serve as deputy administrators. These cadres brought policies to the canteens, publicized policies, and implemented policies, quickly helping the canteens to establish and improve the democratic management system, helping to study and arrange specific methods for planned use of grain and saving grain, and helping each public canteen to initially establish family production, which greatly improved the work of the canteens, mobilized the enthusiasm of commune members for production, and promoted production. At the end of October, the county party committee summarized the experience of the Hongqi Canteen of the First Production Team of Yonghe Management Area of ​​Xinzhuang Commune in carrying out the competition, and immediately made a decision to call on all public canteens in the county to widely carry out competition between canteens, between administrators, and between cooks.

The most distinctive feature after the competition was launched is that policies are thoroughly publicized and well implemented. All public canteens in the county have universally achieved "quotas to households, grain to the hall, supply by ticket, savings for oneself, money given when needed, and grain given when needed," so that planned use of grain and saving grain have become the conscious actions of the masses, and a new atmosphere of everyone caring about the canteen and everyone running the canteen democratically has emerged. Chen Yonglu, the propaganda member of the Xinzhuang Commune Party Committee, served as the deputy administrator of the canteen of the Ninth Team of Yaoxin Management Area. He helped the commune members arrange plans for saving grain, and made it possible to announce the amount of grain saved by each commune member every day and to cash it out every three days. In this way, not only could the commune members use grain in a planned way, but they also paid attention to saving. This canteen, with a total of 306 people eating, saved more than 2,200 kilograms of grain in October alone. According to statistics from 1,120 canteens in the county, more than 600,000 kilograms of grain have been saved in October.

During the movement, all public canteens, with the canteen as the center, comprehensively arranged the lives of commune members in the cold season. In order to take care of the convenience of commune members for heating in winter and for the elderly and children to eat, methods were adopted that combined cooking and heating. The grain and vegetables for non-laborers who go home to eat are supplied by the canteen, and the grain is distributed according to the per capita quota standard, and the vegetables are priced and supplied according to the number of people.

In order to ensure that the canteens are getting better and better and that the living standards of commune members are continuously improved, all public canteens have also vigorously developed family production during the competition movement. The number of canteens raising pigs has increased from 1,360 to 1,950, and the number of pigs raised has increased by more than 40%. At the same time, all public canteens have also made specific arrangements for winter vegetables.

The better the canteens are run, the more powerfully production is promoted. At present, more than 300,000 commune members in the county are rushing to complete the autumn harvest and autumn plowing tasks ahead of schedule, while rushing to thresh and deliver grain, and accumulating and making fertilizer and carrying out winter sideline production, to make various preparations in advance for next year's great production.

    榆树县选派大批干部把政治带进食堂掀起互比竞赛
    讲政策  树标兵  食堂越办越好
    本报长春25日电　中共吉林省榆树县委继组织二千二百七十名县、公社、管理区的干部深入食堂、兼任副管理员以后，又及时发动了一个食堂与食堂、管理员与管理员、炊事员与炊事员之间的竞赛，大力宣传政策，贯彻政策，使食堂越办越好。
    竞赛的内容是：宣传贯彻执行党的方针政策好；计划用粮、节约用粮好；民主管理好；作好饭菜调剂社员生活好；粮菜保管和过冬工作做得好；学习推广先进经验好；食堂家底生产搞的好；炊具改革和使用的好；食堂清洁卫生好；群众观点强服务态度好。全县在发动竞赛的第十天进行了第一次检查评比，出现了红旗标兵食堂三百一十九个，标兵食堂管理员三百五十八名，标兵炊事员八百三十九名，标兵粮食管理员四百九十四名，并涌现出大批办食堂积极分子和办伙能手。
    中共榆树县委本着一手抓生产，一手抓生活的精神，坚持实行
  “政治进食堂，干部下厨房”的领导方法，在10月份选派了二千多名各级干部，深入食堂，兼任副管理员。这批干部把政策带到食堂，宣传政策，贯彻政策，迅速帮助食堂建立与健全了民主管理制度，帮助研究安排了计划用粮和节约用粮的具体方法，帮助各个公共食堂初步建立起了家底生产，使食堂工作有了很大提高，调动起社员生产积极性，促进了生产。10月底，县委在新庄公社总结了这个公社永合管理区第一生产队红旗食堂开展竞赛的经验，立即作出决定，号召全县各个公共食堂之间、管理员之间、炊事员之间广泛开展竞赛。
    竞赛开展起来后最鲜明的特点是政策宣传得透，贯彻得好。全县各个公共食堂普遍地作到了“指标到户、粮食到堂、凭票供应、节约归己、要钱给钱、要粮给粮”，从而使计划用粮、节约用粮变成了群众的自觉行动，出现了人人关心食堂，大家民主办食堂的新气象。新庄公社党委宣传委员陈永禄，兼任腰新管理区第九队食堂副管理员后，帮助社员安排节约用粮计划，作到了日日公布每个社员的节约粮数，三日一兑现。这样，不但使社员能够作到有计划地用粮，而且也注意节约。这个食堂共三百零六口人用饭，仅10月份就节约二千二百多斤粮。据全县一千一百二十个食堂的统计，在10月份已经节约粮食六十多万斤。
    在运动中，各个公共食堂做到以食堂为中心，全面安排好严寒季节中的社员生活。为了照顾社员过冬取暖和老年人和小孩的用饭方便，采取作饭与取暖相结合的方法。回家吃饭的非劳力的粮、菜由食堂负责供应，粮米按每人的定量标准发给，菜作价按人供应。
    为了保证食堂越办越好，使社员生活水平不断提高，各个公共食堂在竞赛运动中还大搞家底生产。养猪的食堂由一千三百六十个增加到一千九百五十个，养猪头数增加40％以上。与此同时，各个公共食堂对过冬的蔬菜也都作了具体安排。
    食堂越办越好，更有力地促进了生产。目前，全县三十多万名社员正在提前完成秋收、秋翻任务的基础上，一面突击打场、送粮，一面积肥、造肥和开展冬季副业生产，为明年大生产提前作好各项准备工作。（附图片）
