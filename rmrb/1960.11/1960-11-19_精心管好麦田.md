    Carefully Manage Wheat Fields
    “Three Guarantees” Implemented, Wheat Fields Upgraded
    How to manage wheat fields well? In addition to strengthening various management measures, our commune party committee also organized a work group to inspect the implementation of the "three guarantees and one reward" system.

    The work group's inspection of various production teams revealed that the "three guarantees" for wheat fields had been implemented in most teams. As a result, management measures were meticulous and timely, wheat seedlings grew well, and the masses were highly motivated. However, some problems were also found in the wheat field management work of individual production teams. For example, the Gu Tan Production Team could not effectively mobilize the production enthusiasm of its members because the contracted output was too low. In response to this situation, the work group, together with the team cadres, convened a forum of members' representatives and experienced farmers to fully mobilize the masses, discuss and formulate various specific measures for managing wheat fields well, and appropriately adjust the contracted output targets.

    Wherever this work group went, it helped to solve specific problems; at the same time, it fully publicized the party's various policies, eliminated some ideological concerns of the members, and further mobilized the members' enthusiasm for managing wheat fields well. For example, after the work group helped the Xidi Production Team formulate a reward and punishment system, many production teams inspected the wheat fields plot by plot, classified them, managed them carefully, and immediately fertilized and watered 100 mu of poorly growing wheat fields, upgrading these wheat fields. More than 1,800 mu of wheat fields have already been cultivated in the whole commune.

    Ensure Safe Wintering of Wheat in Saline-Alkali Land
    There is a lot of saline-alkali land in Yongledian Commune, Tongxian County, Beijing. Ensuring the safe wintering of wheat in saline-alkali land (saline-alkali land has high moisture content and high salt content, and wheat is easily frozen to death in winter) is a key factor for a bumper harvest next summer.

    The methods of Yongledian Commune to ensure the wintering of wheat in saline-alkali land are: 1. Spreading mulching manure to increase the ground temperature. Because organic fertilizer contains a large amount of organic acid, it can play a role in neutralizing acid and alkali and reduce the alkali content in the soil, which is beneficial to wheat wintering. 2. Watering well before freezing. Maintaining a certain amount of moisture in the soil can prevent the salt content in the ground from rising, so as to avoid the harm of the spring return period; 3. Cultivating frequently before freezing and loosening the topsoil can play a role in keeping warm. Due to the above measures, the wheat seedlings on the saline-alkali land in this commune are growing very well.

    Manage Late-Planted Wheat Well
    Our commune planted 31,000 mu of "Sanmai" (three kinds of wheat) this year, of which late-planted wheat accounts for about 70%. After the planting was completed, some cadres and members believed that "there is no big problem after the wheat is planted, and wheat field management is a 'soft' task, and it doesn't matter if it is a few days late." In response to these numb thoughts, the commune party committee explained the importance of managing late-planted wheat early this year to the members, and at the same time mobilized cadres and the masses to come up with ideas and ways to manage the wheat fields well.

    Through mass discussion, everyone realized that to call for a bumper harvest of "Sanmai", it is necessary to vigorously grasp late-planted wheat, and it is proposed that wheat seedlings must be transformed from thin to fertile and from weak to strong. The central issue in managing wheat fields is water and fertilizer. The commune helped each production team divide the "high-yield plots" of late-planted wheat, and implemented the system of "three guarantees" being implemented and responsibility to the individual. Now, in 2,100 mu of late-planted wheat fields in the whole commune, 1,750 ridges and ditches have been excavated and sorted out, the first topdressing of water and fertilizer for promoting seedlings has been applied, and manure ponds have been set up next to the "high-yield plots" to continuously fertilize and water to ensure that the late-planted wheat is uniform and strong before winter, catching up with the early-planted wheat.

    Emergency Prevention and Treatment of Wheat Rust
    Some of the wheat fields in our Baidaokou Commune have developed rust disease, among which more than 21,000 mu of early-planted wheat fields have more serious rust disease, and some wheat leaves have turned yellow and stopped tillering. The commune party committee, led by the first secretary Wang Taizhang, took emergency prevention and control measures, and vigorously prevented and controlled rust disease according to the method of commune contracting teams, team contracting groups, group contracting people, and people contracting plots.

    The prevention and control method is based on the principle of simplicity and thrift, and a large amount of salt water, human urine, and lime-sulfur mixture are used. After vigorous prevention and treatment, the diseased wheat leaves have turned from yellow to green, and the spread of rust disease has been basically controlled.

    精心管好麦田
    “三包”落实麦田升级
    怎样把麦田管好？我们公社除了加强各项管理措施外，公社党委还组织工作组检查了“三包一奖”制度贯彻执行的情况。
    工作组在各个生产队检查结果，发现大部分队的麦田三包已经落实，因此管理措施细致及时，麦苗生长得好，群众情绪很高。但也发现个别生产队在麦田管理工作中存在一些问题。例如古坛生产队因为包产偏低，不能很好地调动社员的生产积极性。针对这种情况，工作组协同队干部召开了社员代表和老农座谈会，充分发动群众，讨论制订了管好麦田的各种具体措施，并把包产指标作了适当调整。
    这个工作组走到哪里，就帮助哪里解决具体问题；同时充分宣传党的各项政策，消除社员的一些思想顾虑，进一步调动社员管好麦田的积极性。例如工作组在西堤生产队帮助制订奖罚制度后，很多生产小队逐块检查了麦田，做到了分类排队，精心管理，立即对一百亩生长较差的麦田加肥浇水，使这些麦田升了级。全社已经中耕的麦田有一千八百多亩。

    保碱地小麦安全过冬
    北京通县永乐店公社盐碱地较多，保证碱地小麦安全过冬（盐碱地水分大，含盐量高，小麦越冬容易冻死。）是明年夏季丰收的重要关键。
    永乐店公社保证盐碱地小麦过冬的办法是：一、铺施蒙头粪增高地温。因为有机肥料中含有大量的有机酸，可以起酸碱中和作用，减少土壤中的含碱量，这样就有利于小麦过冬。二、浇好冻水。土壤中保持一定的水分，能使地层中的盐分不上升，以避免春季返浆期的危害；三、封冻前勤中耕，疏松表土，可以起保温的作用。由于采取了以上措施，目前这个公社盐碱地上的麦苗生长得都很好。

    管好晚茬麦
    我们公社今年播种“三麦”三万一千亩，其中晚茬麦占70％左右。播种结束以后，有部分干部和社员认为“麦子种下去问题就不大了，麦田管理是个‘软’任务，迟几天不要紧。”公社党委针对这些麻痹思想，向社员说明了今年早管晚茬麦的重要性，同时发动干部和群众出主意想办法管好麦田。
    通过群众讨论，大家认识到要叫“三麦”丰收，必须大抓晚茬麦，并且提出一定要麦苗由瘦转肥，由弱变壮。管理麦田的中心问题是水和肥料，公社就帮助各生产队划分了晚茬麦“丰产片”，贯彻执行了“三包”落实、责任到人的制度。现在全社已在二千一百亩的晚茬麦田中，开挖和整理了畦田沟一千七百五十条，追施了第一遍促苗的水肥，并在“丰产片”旁设立了田头粪塘，不断地加肥加水，保证晚茬麦在越冬前苗齐苗壮，赶上早茬麦。

    紧急防治麦锈病
    我们白道口公社的一部分麦田发生了锈病，其中有二万一千多亩的早播麦田锈病比较严重，有些麦叶已经发黄，停止了分蘖。公社党委由第一书记王太章挂帅，采取了紧急防治措施，并按照社包队、队包组、组包人、人包地块的办法大力防治锈病。
    防治方法是本着因陋就简的原则，大量使用盐水、人尿水和石灰硫黄合剂。经过大力防治，发病的麦叶已由黄转绿，基本控制住了锈病的蔓延。
