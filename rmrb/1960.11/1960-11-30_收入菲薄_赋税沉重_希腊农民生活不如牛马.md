Xinhua News Agency, Athens Dispatch: The Greek newspaper *Dawn* stated in an editorial on the 22nd that the Karamanlis government "has imposed unbearable tax burdens on the shoulders of the people in urban and rural areas, making life impossible." *Dawn* said that in the past few days, the government has levied new taxes amounting to 3% of agricultural income on various agricultural products. In general, the new tax system will extract 2.5 billion drachmas from the meager income of the people during the period up to 1962.

The newspaper pointed out that the government is levying new and unbearable taxes under the pretext of needing money to pay farmers' annuities. However, the total amount of these annuities that the Greek government has promised to give to farmers does not exceed 230 million drachmas per year, while the remaining more than 2 billion drachmas are used to make up for the national budget deficit. The newspaper emphasized that 50% of the national budget is used for military purposes under pressure from the United States.

*Dawn* reported that housing for rural residents is extremely scarce. According to official reports, among one million rural families, 105,000 families, approximately 500,000 people, have no houses at all, and 109,000 families live in very unsanitary conditions. The newspaper said that rural residents' housing is extremely crowded. Even some families, old and young, male and female, live in one room together. Some farmers live in even worse conditions, living with livestock such as cattle, sheep, donkeys, and horses.

    收入菲薄　赋税沉重
    希腊农民生活不如牛马
    据新华社讯　雅典消息：希腊《黎明日报》22日的社论指出，卡拉曼利斯政府“把难以忍受的赋税负担加在城乡人民肩上，弄得民不聊生”。《黎明日报》说，政府在过去几天内对各种农产品征收占农业收入3％的新赋税。总的来说，新的赋税制度将使政府在到1962年为止的时期内从人民的菲薄的收入中榨取二十五亿德拉克马。
    这家报纸指出，政府借口需要钱来付给农民年金而开征新的难以忍受的赋税，但是，希腊政府答应给农民的这些年金的总数每年不超过二亿三千万德拉克马，而其余二十多亿德拉克马是用来弥补国家预算赤字。报纸着重指出，国家预算中的50％是在美国压力下被用于军事目的。
    《黎明日报》报道，乡村居民的住房极为缺乏。根据官方的报告，在一百万个乡村家庭中，有十万零五千个家庭，大约五十万人完全没有房子住，十万零九千个家庭在非常不卫生的条件下生活。报纸说，乡村居民的住房极为拥挤。甚至，有些家庭，一家老老小小、男男女女，同住在一间房间里。有些农民居住条件更坏，和牛、羊、驴、马等家畜住在一起。
