Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's people's communes are universally taking canteens as the center, properly arranging the winter lives of their members.

Recently, Party committees in various locations have strengthened their leadership over canteens. The Zhelimu League's finance and trade system has transferred ninety-eight cadres to rural public canteens to serve as administrators. Over 90% of these cadres are Party members and Communist Youth League members. In order to run the canteens well, various places have universally strengthened the leadership advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in the canteens, and further improved the grain usage and financial management systems of the canteens.

Arrangements have also been made in various places for the vegetables and other non-staple foods that members will eat during the winter. Currently, over 50,000 rural canteens across the region are harvesting autumn vegetables in their own vegetable plots. Many canteens are adopting various methods such as pickling, salting, sun-drying, freezing, pressing juice, and cellaring to process and store vegetables for the winter. The Ke'erqin Right Wing Middle Banner's Liu Hu People's Commune in Hulunbuir League harvested a total of 27.5 million catties of autumn vegetables, enough to feed the entire commune's population for several months, bridging the gap until fresh vegetables become available next year. In addition to collectively storing most of the winter vegetables in the canteen units, this commune, in order to solve the problem of a shortage of jars in the canteens, also mobilized members to pickle a jar of sauerkraut for the canteen in each household, with storage distributed among households but unified usage. Some canteens have also made plans for vegetable consumption, determining to eat scattered vegetables first, and choosing large quantities of good vegetables to store; this year mainly eating frozen, pickled, and salted vegetables, and saving the longer-lasting dried vegetables for next spring.

The Inner Mongolia region is relatively cold, and solving the winter heating problems of public canteens and commune member families is also an important task in preparing for the winter. Party committees of communes in various places have made unified arrangements for this task. Regions that have already completed or basically completed the autumn harvest have extracted a portion of the labor force to construct a batch of dining halls with fire walls and heated kang facilities, according to the habits of the masses. The canteens of the production teams of the Jishengtai Commune in Siziwang Banner, Ulanqab League, have universally built a type of "earthen heating," using adobe to build a Hui-shaped smokestack dining table and benches. Burning stubble and firewood are done outdoors, which can ensure the warmth of the canteen and also achieve cleanliness and hygiene.

In addition, various places have universally mobilized the masses to pick stubble, cut firewood, and trim tree branches, thinking of various ways to raise fuel for winter heating. Mountainous areas organize part of the labor force to go to the mountains to collect firewood. The Dataan Commune Head No. 1 Management Area of the Chahar Right Wing Middle Banner, combined with the grain storage work, transports grain when going and brings back coal when returning. It has now prepared fuel for winter heating for more than 80% of the commune members' homes.

This newspaper Taiyuan 4th Dispatch: The Kaizhang Commune Shiqiao Management Area Party branch in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, taking the canteen as the center, comprehensively arranges the winter life of commune members.

Recently, the management area Party branch secretary led production team leaders and canteen administrators to conduct a universal inspection of the kindergartens and public canteen kitchens, dining halls, and commune member families. The inspection found that some dining halls were too large and not easy to keep warm in winter; some doors and windows did not have curtains; there were too few stoves in the kitchen, and steamed buns and stir-fried dishes could not be rotated. In response to these problems, the Party branch promptly organized commune members to make temporary partition walls for large dining halls to reduce the size of the dining halls. The ceilings and windows were all re-papered, grass curtains were added to the doors and windows, and a stove was built in the dining hall to create "earthen heating." The canteen also added dining halls for the elderly and dining halls for mothers and children. In order to ensure that commune members had hot steamed buns and rice and hot soup and dishes at every meal, the canteen kitchen added stoves and equipped two sets of stoves for steaming buns and boiling soup. New insulated bun boxes and vegetable insulation cylinders were added to ensure that the food was not taken out of the steamer until people arrived, and the soup and dishes were not taken out of the pot, so that commune members could eat hot and warm. The management area also helped the canteen establish a non-staple food processing plant, organized six large carts to transport winter coal to the canteen and commune member families, and at the same time organized commune members to cut firewood for heating kangs in their homes.

While comprehensively considering the winter life of commune members, the canteen also paid special attention to the care of the elderly, the sick, postpartum women, and children. Waiters implemented serving meals to the table, allowing the elderly and sick to eat more easily digestible green vegetables, fresh vegetables, and flavorful soup meals; giving pregnant women and children more nutritious meals to ensure they eat warm and well.

In arranging the winter life of commune members, all canteens have paid attention to planned grain usage and vegetable harvesting, storage, and winter vegetable planting. All canteens have built vegetable cellars and prepared a large number of jars for pickling salted vegetables, fermenting sauerkraut, and soaking yellow vegetables. After mobilizing commune members to collect and store large quantities, the entire region has prepared 120,000 catties of pickled vegetables for the winter, more than 100,000 catties of dried vegetables, more than 200,000 catties of stored fresh vegetables, and 290,000 catties of fermented sauerkraut and soaked yellow vegetables. The management area also plans to intercrop spinach in wheat fields, and intercrop rapeseed and turnips in cotton fields, and plant spinach, lettuce, scallions, and garlic on vacant land in front of and behind houses, averaging one and a half fen of vegetable land per person. In order to make it convenient for commune member families to eat vegetables, the management area distributes some vegetables to commune members, allowing them to store, pickle, and eat them themselves.

    吃热住暖过寒冬　养精蓄锐迎春耕
    内蒙古各公社加强食堂领导提早贮柴草存冬菜
    山西运城开张公社石桥管理区全面检查食堂过冬准备
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区各地人民公社普遍以食堂为中心，妥善安排社员的冬季生活。
    最近，各地党委都加强了对食堂的领导。哲里木盟财贸系统抽调九十八名干部到各地农村公共食堂担任管理员，这些干部90％以上都是党员和团员。为了把食堂办好，各地普遍加强了贫农、下中农在食堂中的领导优势，进一步健全了食堂的用粮和财务管理等制度。
    各地对社员过冬吃的蔬菜及其他副食品，也都作了安排。目前，全区五万多个农村食堂正在自己的菜地上收获秋菜，许多食堂采用腌、渍、晒、冻、压汁、窖藏等多种办法，加工储藏过冬用菜。呼伦贝尔盟科尔沁右翼中旗六户人民公社共收获秋菜二千七百五十万斤，可供全社人口吃几个月，能接上明年鲜菜下来。这个公社除以食堂为单位集体储藏了大部分过冬用菜外，为了解决食堂缺缸的问题，还发动社员每户给食堂渍一缸酸菜，分户保管，统一使用。有些食堂在用菜方面也作了计划，确定先吃零星菜，选择大宗好菜贮存起来；今年主要吃冻、渍、腌的菜，把保存时间较长的干菜留到明年春天吃。
    内蒙古地区比较寒冷，解决公共食堂和社员家庭冬季取暖问题，也是做好过冬准备的一项重要工作。各地公社党委都就这项工作作了统一的安排。秋收已经结束和基本结束的地区，已抽调出一部分劳动力，根据群众习惯，修建一批有火墙、暖炕设备的饭厅。乌兰察布盟四子王旗吉生太公社各生产队的食堂，普遍修建一种“土暖气”，用土坯建成回字形通烟火的饭桌、坐凳，烧茬子烧柴都在室外，既能保证食堂的温暖，又可以做到清洁卫生。
    此外，各地普遍发动群众拣茬子、割柴禾和整修树枝，多方面想办法筹集冬季取暖用的燃料。靠山地区组织部分人力上山打柴。察哈尔右翼中旗大滩公社头号管理区结合粮食入库工作，去时拉粮，回来捎炭，现已给80％以上的社员家里准备好过冬取暖用的燃料。
    本报太原4日电　山西省运城县开张公社石桥管理区党支部，以食堂为中心，全面安排社员冬季生活。
    最近管理区党支部书记带领生产队长、食堂管理员对幼儿园和公共食堂的厨房、饭厅以及社员家庭，普遍进行了检查。检查中发现，有的饭厅过大，冬季不易保暖；有的门窗没有帘子；厨房锅灶少，蒸馍炒菜倒换不开。党支部针对这些问题，及时组织社员给大饭厅作临时隔墙，缩小饭厅，顶棚、窗户都重新用纸糊了一遍，给门窗添设上草帘，饭厅垒起火炉，建起了“土暖气”，食堂还增设了老人饭厅、母子饭厅。为了保证社员顿顿馍饭热，汤菜热，食堂厨房都增设了火炉，设备了蒸馍、烧汤两套炉具，新添了保温馍箱、保菜筒，作到开饭人不到堂，馍不出笼，汤、菜不出锅，让社员吃得热吃得暖。管理区还帮助食堂建立了副食加工厂，组织了六辆大车突击给食堂和社员家庭载运冬季用煤，同时组织社员给家庭割烧炕取暖用柴。
    食堂在全面考虑社员冬季生活的同时，还特别注意对老人、病人、产妇、小孩的照顾。服务员实行端饭送到桌，让老人、病人多吃易消化的青菜、鲜菜、适口味的汤饭；给孕妇、小孩多吃有营养的饭菜，保证他们吃暖吃好。
    各食堂在安排社员冬季生活中都注意到计划用粮和蔬菜收获、贮存、冬种菜。各食堂都修建了菜窖，准备了大量腌咸菜、沤酸菜、泡黄菜用的缸。经过发动社员大采、大贮，全区已给过冬腌菜十二万斤，晒干菜十万余斤，贮鲜菜二十余万斤，沤酸菜、泡黄菜二十九万斤。管理区还计划在小麦地套种菠菜，在棉花地套种油菜、蔓菁，房前屋后开荒地种菠菜、莴笋、葱蒜，平均每人有一分半菜地。为了照顾社员家庭吃菜方便，管理区分配部分蔬菜给社员，让社员们自贮、自腌，自己食用。（附图片）
