Xinjiang and Heilongjiang are seizing the opportunity to arrange for livestock to safely overwinter.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 5th – In the vast pastoral areas of northern and southern Tianshan in Xinjiang, leaders at all levels are going deep into the pastures, mobilizing people of all ethnic groups to launch livestock overwintering preparations centered on forage harvesting and storage, livestock shelter construction, and increased livestock fatness, earlier and better than any previous year.

This year, the forage harvesting work in various pastoral areas of Xinjiang started early, moved quickly, harvested more, and harvested well. According to incomplete statistics as of mid-October, the entire region has harvested more than 6 billion catties of forage. Among them, the ten counties and cities directly under the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture have harvested an average of more than 600 catties of forage for each head of livestock. Counties such as Zhaosu, Tekes, and Qitai have exceeded the plan of harvesting 1,500 catties of forage per head of large livestock and 500 catties per head of small livestock. The winter forage harvested and stored by various agricultural and pastoral farms of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to date has exceeded four times that of the same period last year. In the vigorous forage harvesting campaign, cadres at all levels in various pastoral areas generally went deep into the pastures and lived and ate on the grasslands with the broad masses of herdsmen, while harvesting forage while leading the work, greatly accelerating the progress of forage harvesting and improving the quality of forage harvesting. At present, all localities have broken the past practice of not continuing to harvest forage after frost and are organizing large numbers of laborers to continue harvesting and storing winter forage until the grassland is covered by heavy snow. While harvesting forage, various localities are also widely organizing the masses to collect grass seeds and tree leaves. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps alone has collected 5.09 million catties of grass seeds.

This year, all localities dispatched dedicated personnel to winter and spring pastures ahead of time to repair old livestock shelters and build new ones to ensure the safe overwintering of livestock. In addition to repairing a large number of existing livestock shelters, more than 9,000 new livestock shelters have been built in various localities. At present, all localities are taking advantage of the time before the severe cold arrives and the autumn sowing has ended to concentrate a large number of laborers to continue to repair and build livestock shelters. Many areas have also prepared livestock shelters for all female livestock, young livestock, and breeding males, and repaired and built complete winter and spring lambing, lamb protection, and lamb rearing houses.

Another important measure to ensure the safe overwintering and spring crossing of livestock is to focus on autumn fattening, so that every head of livestock is fat and strong, increasing their resistance to cold and disease. This year, Party committees at all levels have paid special attention to this work. According to recent general inspections in various localities, the vast majority of livestock are rated as first-class, with up to 90%, and the overall fatness of various livestock has also greatly exceeded that of last year.

At present, in addition to focusing on the above three tasks, various localities have also organized dedicated personnel to conduct advance surveys and劃分冬划分 winter pastures, survey the roads for various livestock to move from autumn pastures to winter pastures, designate dedicated personnel to set up a large number of transfer stations on the roads for livestock transfer, and begin to transport forage and solve water problems to ensure that all livestock safely reach the most suitable winter pastures.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Heilongjiang Province is actively preparing for the safe overwintering of livestock. At present, the province has repaired and newly built more than 330,000 horse and cattle sheds, including more than 86,000 warm sheds. People's communes have stored a large amount of feed, assigned special personnel to feed large livestock, and are doing a good job in protecting pregnancies and foals.

Heilongjiang Province has long winters and cold climate. In order to prevent livestock from suffering from cold and freezing in winter, people's communes in various localities have rationally arranged labor in conjunction with the autumn harvest to carry out crash repairs and new construction of livestock sheds. In conjunction with the autumn harvest, all that can be fed, such as grain stalks, rice straw, and millet straw, are stored.

People's communes in various localities also pay great attention to the utilization, feeding, and management of large livestock and have established a responsibility system for utilization and feeding. Many people's communes in areas such as Lindian, Mishan, Keshan, and Durbert Mongolian Autonomous County have also established old and weak horse rehabilitation yards and pregnant animal delivery wards by production team.

    抢在冬前多贮饲草搭好棚圈
    新疆黑龙江抓紧时机安排牲畜安全过冬
    本报乌鲁木齐5日电　新疆天山南北广大牧区各级领导干部深入牧场，发动各族牧民展开以打草贮草、搭盖棚圈、增加畜膘为中心的牲畜过冬准备工作，比已往任何一年都抓得早、抓得好。
    今年，新疆各牧区打草工作动手早、行动快、打得多、打得好，截至10月中旬的不完全统计，全疆已打草六十多亿斤。其中伊犁哈萨克自治州直属十个县、市，平均已为每头大小牲畜打草六百多斤。昭苏、特克斯、奇台等县已超额完成了每头大畜打草一千五百斤、小畜打草五百斤的计划。新疆生产建设兵团各农、牧场截至目前割储的冬草，已超过去年同期的四倍。在轰轰烈烈的打草运动中，各牧区各级干部普遍深入牧场和广大牧民住在草原、吃在草原、一边打草、一边领导这一工作，大大加快了打草进度，提高了打草质量。目前各地已打破了已往下霜后不继续打草的惯例，组织大批劳力继续割储冬草、直到大雪复盖了草原为止。各地在打草的同时，还广泛组织群众采集草籽、树叶。仅新疆生产建设兵团采集的草籽就达五百零九万斤。
    今年各地都提早抽调专人，分赴各冬、春牧场，整修旧棚圈、搭盖新棚圈，保证牲畜安全过冬。各地除整修好以往的大批棚圈外，已新盖好棚圈九千多所。目前各地正利用严寒尚未到来，秋种已经结束的这一时机，集中大批劳力，继续抢修和搭盖棚圈。不少地区也准备好了全部母畜、幼畜和种公畜的棚圈，修盖了完善的冬春产羔、保羔、育羔房舍。
    保证牲畜安全过冬越春的另一项重要措施，是抓好秋膘，使头头牲畜膘肥体壮，增加抗寒抗病的能力。今年各级党委都特别抓紧了这项工作。据各地最近普遍检查的结果：各类牲畜的一类膘大多达90％，而且各类牲畜的体膘也大大超过去年。
    目前，各地除大抓以上三项工作外，还组织专人提前勘察和划分冬季牧场，勘察各类牲畜由秋牧场转入冬牧场的道路，指定专人在牲畜转移的道路上设立大批的转移站，开始拉运草料和解决饮水问题，以保证全部牲畜安全到达最适合的冬季牧场。
    据新华社讯　黑龙江省积极进行牲畜安全过冬的准备工作。目前全省已整修和新建马棚、牛棚三十三万多间，其中暖棚八万六千多间。各人民公社已贮备了大量饲料，并确定专人喂养大牲畜，做好保胎保驹工作。
    黑龙江省冬季漫长，气候寒冷，为了不让牲畜在冬季挨冷受冻，各地人民公社都结合秋收，合理安排劳力，突击整修和新建畜舍。并且结合秋收，把谷草、稻草、糜秸等，凡是能喂的都贮存起来。
    各地人民公社还十分注意大牲畜的使役和饲养管理，建立了使役、饲养等责任制度。林甸、密山、克山、杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县等地的许多人民公社，还以生产队为单位建立了老、弱马复壮院和孕畜产院。
