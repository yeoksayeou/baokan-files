	Contemporary Heroes
	The Wang Yiyuan Converter Steelmaking Group is an ever-victorious team at the Tangshan Steel Plant in Hebei Province. For three years, Wang Yiyuan and the group's workers have worked hard and skillfully, diligently and thriftily, making many important contributions to converter steelmaking. In May of this year, after this group created the "contract system" for converter steelmaking, production rose linearly, consistently leading the entire plant, with pig iron consumption decreasing month by month. In September, they set a new record of consuming 1001 kg of pig iron per ton of steel, and the qualified rate of steel ingots has remained at an average of over 99.5%. In September, this group established a contract furnace team, giving the "contract system" experience a new development, and won the "championship" again in the plant's competition of various indicators. Now, young workers throughout the province are widely launching a movement to learn from and catch up with the Wang Yiyuan Steelmaking Group.

    当代英雄
    王益元转炉炼钢小组是河北省唐山钢厂一支常胜军。三年来王益元和小组工人们苦干巧干、克勤克俭，为转炉炼钢作出了许多重要贡献。今年5月，这个组创造了转炉炼钢“包炉制”以后，产量直线上升，一直在全厂领先，生铁消耗逐月下降，并在9月份创造了吨钢消耗生铁1001公斤的新纪录，钢锭合格率一直平均在99.5 ％以上。9月份，这个小组成立了包炉队，使“包炉制”经验有了新的发展，在全厂各项指标的竞赛中，又获得了“冠军”。现在全省青年职工广泛开展了学、赶王益元炼钢小组的运动。	本报记者　时盘棋摄
