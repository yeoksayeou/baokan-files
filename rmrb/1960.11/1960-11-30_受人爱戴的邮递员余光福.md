   The Well-Loved Postman, Yu Guangfu
   In the Malianqu People's Commune Post and Telecommunications Office in Wuzhong City, Ningxia, there is a well-loved good postman named Yu Guangfu. Since he became a postman this March, he has been very conscientious in his work, always thinking of the masses. Regardless of rain or wind, regardless of whether the bus arrives early or late, he always insists on delivering the mail as soon as it arrives. One day, it was already after six o'clock in the afternoon, and the bus had just arrived. It was raining, and everyone advised him to deliver it tomorrow. But he said, "The commune members are just free at this time, and we should quickly deliver the newspapers for them to read."
    The postal route that Yu Guangfu runs is seventy li round trip. When it rains, he can't ride his bicycle. He often leaves in the morning and doesn't return until late at night. But when he is out delivering mail, if he encounters commune members harvesting rice, digging potatoes, or threshing grain, he also picks up tools to work with them. He labors alongside the commune members while soliciting their opinions on the post office and his delivery work. After hearing their opinions, he always strives to improve his work. Several teachers at Banqiao Elementary School and Hejiaxiangdao Elementary School had not received their magazine subscriptions. After Yu Guangfu learned about this, he took the time to run to the county post office to check and made sure to replace the missing magazines. Yu Guangfu works and labors diligently like this, and is therefore loved by the broad masses.

   受人爱戴的邮递员余光福 
   宁夏吴忠市马莲渠公社邮电所里有一个受人爱戴的好邮递员，叫余光福。他今年3月担任邮递员以来，对工作十分认真，处处为群众着想，不管下雨刮风，不管班车早到迟到，他总是坚持邮件随到随投。一天，已经是下午六点多钟了，班车才到，天还下着雨，大家都劝他明天去投递。可是他说：“这会儿社员们刚好有空，应该赶紧把报纸送给他们看。”
    余光福所跑的邮路来回有七十里，一下雨就不能骑自行车了，他经常早晨出去，到深夜才能回来。但是他在外边投递邮件时，若遇上社员割稻子、挖洋芋、打场，他也拿起工具干，和社员一面劳动，一面征求社员对邮局和他的投递工作的意见。听了意见后，他总是努力改进工作。板桥完小和何家巷道完小有几个教师订的杂志没有收到，余光福知道后，就抽空跑到县邮局查对，把没收到的杂志给补上。余光福就是这样勤勤恳恳的工作、劳动着，因此受到了广大群众的爱戴。
