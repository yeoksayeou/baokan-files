Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka stated in today's "Akahata" that all party members should strengthen the struggle and crush the attacks of the US-Japan reactionaries on the JCP.

Nosaka pointed out: The upcoming election is a struggle between two roads: peace, independence, neutrality, and democracy versus war, subordination, military alliances, and fascism.

Nosaka said that Liberal Democratic Party President Hayato Ikeda recently dared to raise the issue of the new US-Japan "Security Treaty" and slander neutrality as an "illusion." This does not indicate their strength, but rather shows their fear of the broad masses of people raising their political awareness and strengthening their unity, revealing their anxiety. Nosaka pointed out that the Japanese people's support for the Communist Party is becoming wider and stronger. At the same time, the attacks of the US-Japan reactionaries are concentrated on the Communist Party.

Nosaka emphasized that it is precisely because the Communist Party is advancing that the enemy wants to attack the JCP. Therefore, all party members must strengthen their confidence, intensify their propaganda activities, crush the enemy's conspiracies, and strive to ensure the JCP's victory in the election.

The JCP Central Committee's official newspaper, "Akahata," published an editorial today calling on all party members to unite and crush the conspiracy of the US-Japan reactionaries to attack the JCP. The editorial said that seeing the development of the JCP, US imperialism and the traitorous Japanese reactionary forces are deeply alarmed. As the election struggle enters an important stage, they are using various despicable means to attack the JCP and disrupt the JCP's election activities.

"Akahata" called on all party members to exert initiative and creativity, strengthen unity with workers, peasants, and people from all walks of life, crush the attacks of the US-Japan reactionaries, and strive for the JCP's victory in the election.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 7th, advocating the abolition of foreign military bases in Japan, the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and the implementation of a policy of peaceful neutrality.

The statement emphasized that the active purpose of the neutrality policy the Socialist Party is striving for is to ease international tensions.

The Socialist Party issued this statement to refute a series of malicious slanders made by the Ikeda government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in recent election campaigns against the demand that Japan pursue a policy of neutrality. The Socialist Party recalled in the statement the dire consequences Japan suffered historically by relying on military alliances, and pointed out that neutrality is the way to achieve peace in Japan under the current conditions.

The statement strongly condemned Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda's remarks about Japan wanting to "counter the Soviet Union with the United States as its backing," and pointed out that this is a mistake that ignores historical facts.

The Socialist Party's statement also refuted the Liberal Democratic Party's policy of relying on a "balance of power" to ensure Japan's "security." The statement said that relying on a balance of military force is dangerous and could lead to war. The statement pointed out that neutrality is the safest road.

At the same time, Socialist Party candidates in their election speeches also strongly advocated the abolition of the US-Japan military alliance treaty and the pursuit of a path of peaceful neutrality.

Socialist Party advisor and former chairman Mosaburo Suzuki strongly condemned Ikeda's slander of the Japanese people's demand for neutrality as an "illusion" at an election rally in Tokyo on the 6th.

Suzuki emphasized that neutrality can not only guarantee Japan's security but also prevent the United States from turning Japan into an advance base for launching wars, and further contribute to the cause of world peace.

Socialist Party advisor Hyoe Oharu emphasized at an election rally that Japan must abandon the politics of relying on military force, abolish military alliances, disband the "Self-Defense Forces," and take the path of independence, peace, and neutrality, which is the path that conforms to the Japanese Constitution.

Daishiba Shigeo, the Socialist Party candidate running in the second district of Tokyo and the secretary of the "National Conference to Prevent Revision of the Security Treaty," firmly stated in a speech on the 4th that the Japanese people absolutely cannot recognize the new "Security Treaty" that was forcibly passed by introducing police into the Diet.

Daishiba called on the eight hundred attendees to fight for the establishment of a peaceful and neutral government.

Daishiba strongly criticized the Ikeda government for succumbing to the United States and adopting a policy of hostility towards China and the Soviet Union. He pointed out that Japan's pursuit of a policy of non-recognition of China, following the United States, has aggravated the tension in the Far East.

    野坂说日本大选是和平与战争两条道路的斗争
    号召加强斗争粉碎美日反动派进攻
    社会党发表声明要求取消外国军事基地实行和平中立
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三在今天的“赤旗报”上发表谈话，号召全体党员加强斗争，粉碎美日反动派对日共的攻击。
    野坂指出：即将举行的大选里，是和平、独立、中立、民主同战争、从属、军事同盟、法西斯化这两条道路的斗争。
    野坂说，自由民主党总裁池田勇人最近胆敢提起新日美“安全条约”问题，并诬蔑中立为“幻想”，这并不表明他们的强大，反而表明他们是这样的害怕广大人民提高政治觉悟和加强团结，表明他们的焦虑。野坂指出，日本人民对共产党的支持越来越广泛和加强。与此同时，美日反动派的攻击也集中到共产党身上。
    野坂强调指出，正是由于共产党在前进，敌人才要来攻击日共。因此，全体党员必须坚定信心，加强展开宣传活动，粉碎敌人的阴谋，为确保日共在大选中取得胜利而奋斗。
    日共中央机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召全体党员团结起来，粉碎美日反动派攻击日共的阴谋。社论说，看到日共的发展，美帝国主义和日本卖国反动势力感到严重恐慌。在竞选斗争进入重要阶段时，它们使用各种卑鄙手段，攻击日共，破坏日共的竞选活动。
    “赤旗报”号召全体党员发挥积极性和创造性，加强同工人、农民以及各阶层人民的团结，粉碎美日反动派的攻击，并为争取日共在大选中获胜而奋斗。
    新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本社会党7日发表声明，主张取消外国在日本的军事基地和恢复日中邦交，实行和平中立政策。
    声明强调指出，社会党正在努力争取的中立政策的积极目的是缓和国际紧张局势。
    社会党发表这个声明是为了驳斥池田政府和执政党自由民主党最近在竞选运动中对要求日本执行中立政策的主张发出的一系列恶毒诬蔑。社会党在声明中回述了日本在历史上依靠军事同盟所遭受的恶果，并且指出中立是在目前条件下实现日本和平的途径。
    声明强烈谴责日本首相池田勇人关于日本要“以美国为后盾同苏联对抗”的言论，并且指出，这是忽视历史事实的错误。
    社会党的声明还驳斥了自由民主党主张依靠“力量均衡”来保障日本“安全”的政策。声明说，依靠武力均衡反而是危险的，它会导致战争。声明指出：中立才是最安全的道路。
    与此同时，社会党候选人在竞选演说中也强烈主张废除日美军事同盟条约，走和平中立道路。
    社会党顾问、前委员长铃木茂三郎6日在东京举行的竞选演说会上强烈谴责池田诬蔑日本人民关于中立的要求是“幻想”。
    铃木强调指出，中立不仅能够保障日本的安全，而且能够拒绝美国把日本变成它发动战争的前哨基地，进一步对争取世界和平作出贡献。
    社会党顾问原彪在竞选演说会上强调指出，日本必须抛弃依靠武力的政治，废除军事同盟，解散“自卫队”，走独立、和平、中立的道路，这是合乎日本宪法的道路。
    在东京第二选区参加竞选的社会党候选人、“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”干事大柴滋夫4日发表演说时坚决表示，日本人民绝对不能承认把警察引进国会强行通过的新“安全条约”。 
    大柴号召八百名与会者为建立和平、中立的政府而奋斗。
    大柴强烈指责池田政府屈从美国，采取敌视中苏两国的政策。他指出，日本追随美国采取不承认中国的政策，加剧了远东的紧张局势。
