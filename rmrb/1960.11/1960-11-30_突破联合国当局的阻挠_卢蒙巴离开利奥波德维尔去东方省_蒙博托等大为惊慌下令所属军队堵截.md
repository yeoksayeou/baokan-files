Xinhua News Agency, November 28th, Leopoldville News: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba left Leopoldville on the 27th for his hometown, Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province. He enjoys widespread support there.

In a communique issued today, Lumumba explained that he was going to Stanleyville to bury his daughter, who had died not long ago. He said that he would return to Leopoldville soon and wait for the arrival of the United Nations "Mediation Committee" composed of Asian and African countries.

It is reported that Lumumba went to Stanleyville after the United Nations authorities refused to provide any transportation or security guarantees. For the past two months, the United Nations authorities have been holding Lumumba under house arrest in his residence under the pretext of "protection," while shielding and condoning the traitor Mobutu and his clique in their wanton sabotage of the unity and independence of the Congo.

According to Reuters, Kasavubu and Mobutu, who were in Brazzaville attending the independence celebrations of (formerly French) Congo Republic, were "very surprised" to hear that Lumumba had left Leopoldville. Mobutu immediately rushed back to Leopoldville. The report said that he had ordered the troops under his control in Leopoldville Province and Equateur Province to "detain and arrest Lumumba if possible."

It is also reported that Congolese President Kasavubu, with the support of the United States, forced his delegation into the United Nations and returned to Leopoldville on the 27th.

It is reported that the people of central Katanga continue to resist the interference and suppression of the "United Nations forces." Another "United Nations forces" officer was killed near Mitwaba town on the 25th.

Xinhua News Agency, November 29th, Elisabethville News: In Jadotville, an important city in western Katanga Province, Congo, demonstrations recently broke out against the reactionary rule of the Tshombe traitorous clique. The demonstrators bravely resisted the Tshombe police who suppressed them and burned a police car.

In Kabalo, in the northeastern part of Katanga Province, the local people launched a struggle against the Belgian colonialists while opposing the Tshombe clique.

According to a spokesman for the "United Nations authorities" on the 29th, the Baluba people are still persisting in their patriotic armed struggle in the northern part of Katanga Province.

In addition, according to news from Leopoldville, Congolese soldiers, dissatisfied with the United States' use of the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of the Congo, disarmed two members of the "United Nations forces" in Leopoldville. Incidents of local people opposing the United Nations intervention forces have also occurred in Kivu Province and Kasai Province.

    突破联合国当局的阻挠
    卢蒙巴离开利奥波德维尔去东方省
    蒙博托等大为惊慌下令所属军队堵截
    新华社28日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴于27日离开利奥波德维尔前往他的故乡、东方省省会斯坦利维尔。他在那里享有广泛的支持。
    在今天发表的一项公报中，卢蒙巴说明他到斯坦利维尔去是为了安葬他不久前死去的女儿。他说，他不久将回利奥波德维尔，等待由亚非国家组成的联合国“调解委员会”的到达。
    据报道，卢蒙巴是在联合国当局拒绝提供任何交通工具和安全保证的情况下前往斯坦利维尔的。在过去两个月中，联合国当局一直以“保护”为名把卢蒙巴软禁在他的住宅里，同时却包庇和纵容叛国分子蒙博托及其集团肆意破坏刚果的统一和独立。
    据路透社报道，正在布拉柴维尔参加（前法属）刚果共和国独立庆典的卡萨武布和蒙博托听到卢蒙巴离开利奥波德维尔的消息后“非常吃惊”，蒙博托立即赶回利奥波德维尔。报道说，他已下令利奥波德维尔省和赤道省的他所控制的军队，“如果可能的话，就扣留并逮捕卢蒙巴”。
    另据报道，刚果总统卡萨武布在美国的支持下把他的代表团硬拉进联合国以后，于27日回到利奥波德维尔。
    据报道，加丹加中部人民继续抗击“联合国军”的干涉和镇压，又一名“联合国军”军官25日在米特瓦巴镇附近被打死。
    新华社29日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：在刚果加丹加省西部重要城市贾多特维尔，最近爆发了人民反对冲伯卖国集团反动统治的示威，示威者英勇抗击镇压他们的冲伯警察，并烧毁了一辆警车。
    在加丹加省东北部的卡巴洛，当地人民在反对冲伯集团的同时，展开了反对比利时殖民者的斗争。
    据“联合国当局”发言人29日透露，在加丹加省北部地区，巴卢巴人仍在坚持爱国武装斗争。
    另据来自利奥波德维尔的消息说，对美国利用联合国干涉刚果内政表示不满的刚果士兵，在利奥波德维尔解除了两名“联合国军”的武装。在基伍省和开赛省也发生了当地人民反对联合国干涉军的事件。
