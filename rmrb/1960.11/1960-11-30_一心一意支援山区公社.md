    Hearts of Red Devotion for the Collective
    Wholeheartedly Supporting Mountainous Communes
    The workers of the Weinan General Machinery Factory in Shaanxi have established the idea of considering it an honor to support mountainous areas and a joy to support poor communes. Since August, they have helped the Chongning Commune establish a preliminary agricultural machinery factory, produced more than 3,000 pieces of farm tools for the commune, and trained thirteen technicians.
    Through organizing workers to visit rural areas for field visits, this machinery factory launched a mass upsurge of "everyone contributing ideas and everyone contributing efforts" in industry supporting agriculture among all employees. Many workers voluntarily went to the commune to help during holidays and rest times. During the tense "three autumns" season, when ploughshares were in short supply in the commune, Li Xinyi and six or seven other workers rode their bicycles to the commune on Sundays to help cast ploughshares. When the commune's agricultural machinery factory was installing machine tools, several workshop leaders brought fitters, electricians, and forgers, and worked in the factory during the day and rushed to the agricultural machinery factory at night to help with the installation. Various departments also actively carried out activities to support agriculture. The production section gave priority to products supporting agriculture and assigned the best technicians to help the commune build factories and train technical personnel. Each workshop also established a repair group, so that when the commune's farm tools were damaged, they were repaired as soon as they arrived.

    颗颗红心为集体
    一心一意支援山区公社
    陕西渭南通用机械厂的职工们，树立了以支援山区为荣、支援穷社为乐的思想。从8月份以来，他们帮助崇凝公社建立了初具规模的农械厂，为公社生产了三千多件农具，培训了十三名技工。
    这个机械厂通过组织职工到农村实地参观访问，在全体职工中，掀起了一个群众性的“人人献计、个个出力”的工业支援农业的高潮。不少工人利用假日和休息时间主动到公社去帮忙。“三秋”紧张的时候，公社犁铧不足，李新义等六、七个工人趁星期天骑上自行车到公社去帮助铸铧。公社农械厂安装机床时，几个车间的班长，带着钳工、电工、锻工，白天在厂生产，夜里赶到农械厂帮助安装。各科室也积极开展了支援农业的活动。生产科对支援农业的产品，尽先安排，并且抽出技术最好的工人，帮助公社建厂和培训技术人员。各车间还都建立了修配组，公社农具有了损坏，就随到随修。
