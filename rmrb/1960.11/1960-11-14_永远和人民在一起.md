    Forever With the People
    Li Dengshan

    After reading about Gan Zuchang's return to his hometown to participate in agricultural production, the glorious image of an old Communist Party member who always dedicates everything he has entirely to the cause of the Party and the people, forever maintains a style of hard struggle, completely integrates with the people, and leads the masses towards socialism, stands before us like a giant.

    Gan Zuchang was a senior general in the People's Liberation Army. He had fought resolutely against the enemy for the cause of the Party and the people and dedicated his most precious youth and prime of life to the revolution. When he was unable to continue working due to a head injury, he resolutely returned to the countryside and participated in agricultural production. Soon after returning to the countryside, he took deep root among the masses and completely integrated with them. He ate the same food as the peasants and lived just as frugally. He was not concerned with and pursuing personal comfort of some kind of "rural idyll." He was entirely concerned with and devoted to the production of the commune and the lives of the masses. In the eyes of the grassroots cadres and the masses, he was an ordinary worker, their elder and relative, and also an old Party member, an old cadre, their guide.

    Comrade Gan Zuchang's deeds show that anyone who wants to take deep root among the people must first completely give their heart to the masses, serve them wholeheartedly, without a trace of falsehood. Like Gan Zuchang: "As long as my heart is still beating, I will certainly build it into a happy new countryside." That is, to regard the wishes of the masses as one's own wishes, to regard the difficulties of the masses as one's own difficulties, and to regard the happiness of the masses as one's own happiness. Only in this way can one gain the trust of the masses and closely integrate with them. Whoever has boiling enthusiasm and boundless loyalty for the cause of the Party and the masses will have a forever young mind.

    Comrade Gan Zuchang worked with the masses to change the production landscape of his hometown by every possible means. This shows that cadres can only play a greater role if they are with the masses, firmly believe in the masses, and rely on the masses. Comrade Gan Zuchang believed in the inexhaustible creativity of the masses and drew strength from the masses, and his own thinking became brighter and brighter. Therefore, although he was in poor health, he made outstanding achievements. Let our broad masses of cadres be like Comrade Gan Zuchang, forever with the people, and contribute their wisdom and strength to building our beautiful socialist motherland.

    永远和人民在一起
    李登山
    读了甘祖昌回乡参加农业生产劳动的事迹，一个始终把自己的一切完全献给党和人民事业，永远保持艰苦奋斗的作风，同人民完全打成一片，带领群众奔向社会主义的老共产党员的光辉形象，像巨人一般站在我们的面前。
    甘祖昌是人民解放军的高级将领，他曾经为党和人民事业同敌人作过坚决斗争，把自己最宝贵的青年和壮年时代献给了革命。当他因头部受伤不能继续工作时，毅然回到农村，参加了农业生产劳动。他回到农村不久，便在群众中深深地扎了根，同群众完全打成一片。他吃的和农民一样，住的也很俭朴。他不是关心和追求着什么“田园之乐”的个人安逸，他所关心和致力的全是公社的生产和群众的生活。在基层干部和群众的眼睛里，他是一个普通劳动者，是他们的长辈和亲人，同时又是一个老党员，老干部，是他们的带路人。
    甘祖昌同志的事迹说明，任何人要想在人民群众中深深扎根，首先必须把自己的心完全交给群众，全心全意为他们，不掺一丝一毫假。像甘祖昌那样：“只要我的心脏还在跳动，我一定把它建设成一个幸福的新农村。”也就是要把群众的愿望看成是自己的愿望，把群众的困难看成是自己的困难，把群众的幸福看成是自己的幸福。这样，才能取得群众的信任，和群众密切结合在一起。谁对党和群众事业具有沸腾的热情和无限的忠诚，谁的思想就会永远年青。
    甘祖昌同志和群众一起，千方百计地改变了家乡的生产面貌。这就说明，干部只有和群众在一起，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，才能发挥更大的作用。甘祖昌同志相信群众的无穷无尽的创造力，从群众中汲取了力量，自己的思想就越来越亮。所以，他虽然身体不好，但做出了出色的成绩。让我们的广大干部都像甘祖昌同志一样，永远和人民在一起，为建设我们美好的社会主义祖国而贡献出自己的智慧和力量。
