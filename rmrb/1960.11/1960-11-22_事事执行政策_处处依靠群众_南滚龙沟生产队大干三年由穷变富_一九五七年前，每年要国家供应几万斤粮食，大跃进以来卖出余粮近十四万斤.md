This dispatch from Tianjin, November 21st, reports: The Party branch of the Nan Gunlonggou Production Team of the Sujiazhuang People's Commune in Pingshan County, Hebei Province, relying on the masses and conscientiously implementing the Party's various policies, has fully mobilized the production enthusiasm of the production teams and all commune members, transforming a "poor mountain village" into a "rich mountain village" in three years.

    Determined to Build the Mountain Area
    Nan Gunlonggou has seventy-two households, scattered in a deep mountain gully stretching over ten li. This area has late springs, cold soil, short daylight hours, and is frequently subjected to valley winds and mountain floods. Moreover, each person averages only nine fen and one li of thin terraced fields. After liberation, especially after agricultural cooperativization, under the correct leadership and strong support of the Party and the government, grain yields per mu increased year by year. However, because of the limited land and poor soil, the state still needed to supply a large amount of grain every year.
    After the establishment of the commune, the Party branch made leading the masses to change the grain shortage situation in the mountain area its top priority. Branch Secretary Li Quanshou always thought, "If we always rely on the state for grain, how can the state accelerate socialist construction? When will we be able to sell surplus grain to the state?" He often educated commune members, "We should have high aspirations and great ambitions, and produce more grain to support national construction."
    Grasping Multiple High-Yield Methods Simultaneously
    Why couldn't grain production in the mountain area be increased rapidly? The Party branch first mobilized commune members to start a discussion. After everyone's research and analysis, the following root causes were identified: First, there was little cultivated land and mostly dry land; second, the land utilization rate was low, with most land only planted with one crop of grain per year; third, there were many low-yield crops and few high-yield crops; fourth, there were few livestock, pigs, and sheep, resulting in insufficient fertilizer.
    How could this situation be changed quickly? At that time, there were two opinions: one opinion was: the mountain area has more people than land, and inconvenient transportation makes land reclamation difficult. The method of creating high-yield fields in the plains should be used to strive for high yields and abundant harvests; the other opinion: relying only on the existing land, no matter how high the yield, is not enough, so land should be vigorously reclaimed to expand the planting area. The Party branch integrated the opinions of the masses and studied the Party's policy of combining multiple planting for abundant harvests with high-yield for abundant harvests, determining to vigorously reform the cultivation system, actively reclaim land to expand the cultivated area, cultivate ordinary fields well, and vigorously develop high-yield flatlands, gullies, and slopes to achieve high yields.
    Clearly Defining the Scope of Operations
    With the production direction clarified, the commune members then raised the issue of the scope of operations. Should high-yield fields be managed uniformly by the production team or by the smaller teams? Who should organize land reclamation? How should the output be calculated? The Party branch believed that this was not only crucial to achieving multiple planting for abundant harvests and high-yield for abundant harvests, but also related to production and distribution policies. After careful consideration, mobilizing the masses for discussion, and requesting instructions from higher levels, the cadres and the masses unanimously agreed that the production team was the basic unit for organizing production in the people's commune and should fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the smaller teams. High-yield fields should be planned uniformly by the production team and managed by the smaller teams; land reclamation should also be organized by the smaller teams, with the team that reclaims the land cultivating it. Only income would be counted, not contract production targets, and procurement would not be counted for three years. At the same time, labor, land, livestock, and farm tools were rationally allocated and fixed for use by each production team. In this way, the smaller team cadres became active, their work became proactive, and the commune members became more and more energetic. Over the past two years, each smaller team has reclaimed more than eighty mu of wasteland and, in accordance with the production team's unified plan, has vigorously promoted intercropping and relay intercropping techniques, increasing the planting area of high-yield crops.
              Implementing Policies to Guarantee Increased Production
    In the process of leading production, the Party branch increasingly felt the great power of the Party's policies and the infinite wisdom of the masses. Therefore, all measures to ensure increased production were guaranteed by thoroughly implementing policies and fully mobilizing the masses. When encountering problems in their work, they first checked the implementation of policies and mobilized the masses to solve them.
    Drought is the biggest threat to production here. The Party branch vigorously led the commune members to develop water sources and transform dry land into paddy fields. In the process of water conservancy construction, it was found that some smaller teams only paid attention to their own land and did not care about the interests of the entire team; others were interested in projects with greater benefits but did not pay attention to transforming small dry fields, all of which affected the speed of water conservancy construction. The Party branch analyzed this situation and believed that this was not only a ideological issue but also related to policy issues. Therefore, first, the cadres and commune members were educated on the consistency of collective and individual interests, explaining that developing water sources to transform dry land into paddy fields was the most important thing in the team's production, and only by first completing projects that benefited the entire team could the entire production plan be guaranteed. At the same time, the policy issues were further resolved.
    With the vigorous development of water sources, more fertilizer was needed. For this issue, they also started by implementing policies, further implementing the policies of rewarding the development of livestock and rewarding the accumulation of fertilizer. It was stipulated that the team that accumulated fertilizer could use it, and the team could use the young animals bred by the team; a fertilizer accumulation reward system was also stipulated for herders; for the fertilizer accumulated by commune members, the method of pricing based on quality and recording work points for dividends was adhered to. All of these played a great role in promoting the development of livestock and the mass movement for accumulating fertilizer. When the commune was first established, the entire team had only two hundred pigs and sheep and forty-six cattle and donkeys. Now, the entire team has increased to one thousand two hundred and sixty-eight pigs and sheep, and the number of cattle and donkeys has increased to eighty-one. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased from several thousand jin in the past to more than ten thousand jin this year. The production team has consistently implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" policy for the smaller teams, and at the same time conducted uncompromising struggles against various violations of policies.
              Earth-shaking Changes
    The Party's policies are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, bringing infinite strength to the people here and causing earth-shaking changes in Nan Gunlonggou. The commune members worked hard for two winters and springs, cutting through mountains and bypassing ridges to build one hundred and nine large and small canals, turning more than 80% of the team's land into irrigated fields. Because there were many sheep, many pigs, and a lot of fertilizer, the originally barren mountain slopes were turned into fertile land. Last summer and autumn, the average grain yield per mu reached one thousand and twenty-seven jin. Although a severe drought was encountered this year, due to a series of disaster resistance and yield protection measures, the estimated grain yield is still not low. Grain production has increased year by year, transforming from a grain-deficient team to a surplus-grain team. Before 1957, this team needed the state to supply tens of thousands of jin of grain every year. In the three years since the Great Leap Forward, the entire team has sold a total of more than one hundred and thirty-nine thousand jin of surplus grain to the state. The living standards of the commune members are also improving day by day, with household incomes increasing year after year.

    事事执行政策　处处依靠群众
    南滚龙沟生产队大干三年由穷变富
    一九五七年前，每年要国家供应几万斤粮食，大跃进以来卖出余粮近十四万斤
    本报天津21日电　河北平山县苏家庄人民公社南滚龙沟生产队党支部，依靠群众，认真执行党的各项政策，充分发挥了生产小队和全体社员的生产积极性，三年时间把“穷山庄”变成了“富山村”。
    立志建设山区
    南滚龙沟有七十二户人家，散居在绵延十几里长的一条深山沟里。这地方春迟、地寒、日照短，还经常受谷风、山洪的侵袭，而且每人平均只有九分一厘薄梯田。解放后，特别在农业合作化以后，在党和政府的正确领导和大力支持下，粮食亩产量逐年增加，但因为地少土薄，每年仍然需要国家供应大批粮食。
    公社成立后，党支部就把领导群众改变山区的缺粮面貌，作为头等重要的任务。支部书记李全寿总这样想：“吃粮老靠国家帮助，国家怎么加快社会主义建设呢？我们几时能卖余粮给国家就好了。”他经常教育社员：“我们应该树雄心、立大志，多打粮食支援国家建设。”
  多种高产一齐抓
    山区的粮食产量为啥不能迅速提高？党支部首先发动社员展开了讨论。经过大家研究分析，找出了以下根源：第一，耕地少，旱地多；第二，土地利用率低，多数土地一年只种一季粮；第三，低产作物多，高产作物少；第四，牲口、猪、羊少，肥料不足。
    怎样才能很快改变这种情况呢？当时有两种意见：一种意见是：山区人多地少，交通不便，开荒困难，应该运用平原搞丰产田的办法，争取高产多收；另一种意见：只靠现有的土地，产量再高也不行，应该大力开荒，扩大种植面积。党支部综合了群众的意见，又学习了党关于多种多收和高产多收相结合的政策，确定要大力改革耕作制度，既要积极开荒，扩大耕地面积，种好一般田；又要大搞丰产川、沟、坡，夺取高额丰产。
  	  明确划分经营范围
    生产方向明确了，社员们又提出了经营范围的问题。丰产田由生产队统一经营还是由小队经营？开荒由谁组织？产量如何计算？党支部认为，这不仅是能否实现多种多收和高产多收的关键，也是关系到生产、分配政策的问题。党支部经过慎重考虑、发动群众讨论和请示上级之后，干部、群众一致认为生产小队是人民公社组织生产的基层单位，应该充分发挥小队的生产积极性。丰产田应该由生产队统一规划，让小队经营；开垦荒地也由小队组织，那队开了那队耕种，只计收入，不计包产指标，三年不计征购。同时又把劳力、土地、牲畜、农具进行了合理搭配，固定给各生产小队使用。这样，小队干部积极了，工作主动了，社员也越干越有劲。两年来，各小队已开垦荒地八十多亩，并根据生产队的统一规划，大力推广了复种、套种技术，增加了高产作物的种植面积。
              执行政策保证增产
    在领导生产的过程中，支部越来越感觉到党的政策的巨大威力，群众的智慧是无穷的。因此，对于保证增产的各项措施，都是通过深入贯彻政策，充分发动群众来保证实现。在工作上遇到问题，也首先从执行政策上进行检查，发动群众来解决。
    旱灾是这里生产最大的威胁。党支部大力领导社员开发水源，变旱地为水田。在水利建设的过程中，发现有的小队只注意本小队的土地，不关心全队的利益；也有的对受益大的工程感兴趣，不注意改造小块旱田，这些都影响着水利建设的速度。党支部分析了这种情况，认为这不仅是个思想问题，也关系到政策问题。于是，首先对干部、社员进行了集体利益和个人利益一致性的教育，说明开发水源变旱田为水田，是全队生产上头等重要的大事，只有首先把全队受益的工程搞好了，整个生产计划才有保证。同时，进一步解决了政策上的问题。
    随着水源的大力开发，要求更多的肥料。对于这个问题，也是首先从贯彻执行政策入手，进一步执行了奖励发展牲畜和奖励积肥的政策。规定那队积肥那队用，小队繁殖了幼畜由小队使用；对牧工也规定了积肥奖励制度；对社员积的肥料，坚持了以质论价和记工分红的办法。所有这些，对促进牲畜的发展和群众性的积肥运动，起了很大推动作用。刚建立公社的时候，全队只有二百只猪、羊和四十六头牛、驴。现在，全队猪、羊增加到一千二百六十八只，牛、驴增加到八十一头。每亩地的施肥量由过去的几千斤，今年增加到一万多斤。生产队对小队一直执行了“三包一奖”政策，同时对各种违犯政策的现象进行了不调和的斗争。
              翻天覆地的变化
    党的政策深入人心，给这里的人们带来了无限的力量，使南滚龙沟发生了翻天覆地的变化。社员们大干了两个冬春，就劈山绕岭，修了大小渠道一百零九条，使全队80％以上的土地变为水浇田。因为羊多、猪多、肥料多，把原来土质瘠薄的山坡地变成了肥沃的良田。去年夏秋两季粮食作物平均每亩就达到了一千零二十七斤。今年虽然遇到了严重旱灾，由于采取了一系列的抗灾保收措施，预计粮食产量仍然不低。粮食产量逐年增加，由缺粮队变成了余粮队。1957年以前，这队每年都要国家供应几万斤粮食，大跃进以来的三年，全队共卖给国家余粮十三万九千多斤。社员的生活水平也在日益提高，户户年年增加收入。
