    Albanian "People's Voice" Commemorates the Third Anniversary of the Publication of the Moscow Declaration
    The Moscow Declaration is the Fighting Program of the International Communist Movement
    Facts in the past three years have proven the correctness of the main points of the Moscow Declaration. The aggressive nature of imperialism has not changed. It is necessary to continuously strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, unite the anti-imperialist forces of all countries, and raise the revolutionary vigilance of the masses. New facts in the past three years have proven that revisionism is the main danger. The struggle for peace, socialism, and peaceful coexistence must be closely linked with the anti-imperialist struggle.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 25th - The Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 22nd entitled "A Historic Document of Marxism-Leninism" to commemorate the third anniversary of the publication of the Moscow Declaration.
    The editorial said that the declaration of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, published in Moscow three years ago, has become a fighting program of the international communist and workers' movement, a historic document of Marxism-Leninism.
    Life and the development of events in the recent three years have proven the correctness of the main points of the historic Moscow Declaration, which specifically embodies the consistency of views and actions of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries in assessing the relations between them, the practical issues of the international situation, and the struggle for peace and socialism.
    The editorial said that the Albanian Labor Party faithfully and consistently implements the valuable teachings of the historic Moscow Declaration. These teachings have helped our Party and people engage in socialist construction and resolutely defend peace and the victory of the people's revolution.
    The editorial pointed out that life fully proves the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist point of the Moscow Declaration that as long as imperialism exists, there is soil for aggressive wars. Starting from this point and taking into account the attitude of imperialism, our Party has emphasized that imperialism can never become a peace lover, just as a jackal cannot become a sheep. The aggressive, plundering, and bellicose nature of imperialism has not changed. Precisely starting from this historical truth, the Moscow Declaration powerfully exposed that world imperialism, headed by US imperialism, is the enemy of peace, socialism, and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries. US imperialism pursues the so-called "position of strength" policy, trying to establish its rule over the majority of countries in the world, and attempting to obstruct mankind from advancing according to the laws of social development. The Moscow Declaration points out that, under the banner of "anti-communism," US imperialists and their imperialist partners are trying to subjugate more and more countries to their rule, trying to eliminate democratic freedom, threatening the national independence of various countries, wanting to put new colonial shackles on the people of all countries in new forms, frantically opposing the anti-colonialist movement, and constantly carrying out hostile sabotage activities against socialist countries. As practice has proven, the policy of US imperialism has in the past and still tries to gather all the reactionary forces of the capitalist world around itself. Thus, US imperialism has become the center of reactionary forces throughout the world and a fierce enemy of the masses of the people. The Moscow Declaration emphasized that the policies pursued by these anti-people imperialist aggressive forces lead them to their own destruction, creating their own gravediggers.
    The editorial said that the people of all countries in the world clearly see how, after the Second World War, the imperialists such as the United States, Britain, and France, and their servants, have carried out or are still carrying out war planning, promoting conspiracies and aggressive activities in Indochina, Indonesia, Korea, Malaya, Kenya, Guatemala, Egypt, Algeria, Yemen, and the Congo, opposing the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries. At the same time, they stubbornly refuse to reduce armaments, refuse to ban the use and production of atomic and hydrogen weapons, refuse to reach an agreement on immediately stopping the testing of these weapons, oppose complete and thorough disarmament, continue to conduct the so-called "Cold War," carry out an arms race, constantly establish new military bases, implement an aggressive policy that undermines peace, and create the danger of a new war. This is a Marxist-Leninist assessment of the nature of imperialism and the current international situation which has deteriorated due to the aggressive policy pursued by imperialist forces headed by US imperialism. Starting from this, our Party often teaches us that in order to avoid war, to turn the possibility of avoiding war created by the changes in the balance of power into reality, to tie the hands of bellicose imperialists, and to make peaceful coexistence victorious, we must first continuously consolidate and strengthen the unity between the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. This unity is the decisive guarantee of world peace. At the same time, we must unite the struggles of the people of all countries against the danger of war and against the attempts of imperialism to prepare and launch wars; we must raise the revolutionary vigilance of the masses and constantly expose the imperialists, especially US imperialism. No matter what tactics the imperialists adopt, they have been, and still are, a real and serious danger of war breaking out. Life proves that the people of the world, united in their struggle against war and aggression, can restrain the aggressors. The people of all countries and their resolute actions can tie the hands of the imperialists. The recent international events have most clearly demonstrated that the imperialists, headed by the United States, are the enemies of peace, frantically preparing for war, and openly threatening the freedom and independence of the people of all countries.
    The editorial further pointed out that the powerful socialist camp is the main obstacle to imperialism's realization of its inhuman plans and aggressive goals. US imperialism and its loyal servant, the Yugoslav revisionists, are precisely opposing this obstacle, opposing the socialist camp and its unity. The Moscow Declaration emphasized, and the recent three years have again proven with new concrete facts, that revisionism is the main danger, which paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class and demands the maintenance and restoration of capitalism. As an agent of imperialism, modern revisionism plays the shameful role of a "Trojan horse" in the international communist and workers' movement. The Belgrade Tito group is holding up the tattered banner of modern revisionism.
    With their daily hostile activities against the socialist camp and peace, through counter-revolutionary conspiracies, with subversion and espionage, with rumors and intrigues, the Yugoslav revisionists wholeheartedly carry out the tasks assigned to them by their imperialist masters. Therefore, the exposure of US imperialism, the number one enemy of peace and the freedom of the people of all countries, the mad enemy of socialism and communism, is inseparable from the exposure of its loyal servant - the Yugoslav revisionist group. Our Party has in the past and still regards the principled struggle against imperialism and its agents - the Yugoslav revisionists - as its permanent, realistic, and internationalist task. Following the invincible immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism and the wise teachings of the Moscow Declaration, our Party has always closely linked its struggle for peace and socialism, its struggle for the victory of peaceful coexistence, with the struggle against the imperialists and their loyal servants - the Yugoslav revisionists.
    The Albanian Labor Party, its Leninist Central Committee headed by Comrade Hoxha, and all our people, have in the past and are now waging a resolute and unwavering struggle to implement the valuable and tested teachings of the historic Moscow Declaration, because these teachings are a powerful weapon in the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism, for maintaining peace, and for friendship between the people of all countries.

### 莫斯科宣言是国际共产主义运动的战斗纲领

    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”纪念莫斯科宣言发表三周年
    莫斯科宣言是国际共产主义运动的战斗纲领
    三年来事实证明莫斯科宣言主要论点的正确性。帝国主义侵略本性并未改变。必须不断加强社会主义阵营团结，联合各国反帝斗争力量，提高群众革命警惕性。三年来新的事实证明修正主义是主要危险。争取和平、社会主义和和平共处的斗争必须同反帝斗争紧密联在一起。
    新华社地拉那25日电  阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”22日以“马克思列宁主义的历史性文件”为题发表社论，纪念莫斯科宣言发表三周年。
    社论说，三年以前在莫斯科公布了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言，这一马克思列宁主义的历史性文件已成了国际共产主义和工人运动的战斗纲领。
    生活和最近三年来的事态发展证明了历史性的莫斯科宣言的主要论点的正确性，它具体表现了社会主义国家共产党和工人党在估价它们之间的关系、国际形势的实际问题以及争取和平和社会主义的斗争方面的观点和行动的一致性。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党忠诚和一贯地执行莫斯科宣言这一历史性文件的宝贵教诲。这些教诲帮助了我国党和人民从事社会主义建设，坚决保卫和平和人民革命的胜利。
  社论指出，生活充分地证明了莫斯科宣言关于只要帝国主义还存在就有发生侵略战争的土壤的马克思列宁主义论点的正确性。我党从这一论点出发并考虑到帝国主义的态度，曾强调指出，帝国主义绝不能变成和平爱好者，正如豺狼不能变成绵羊一样。帝国主义的侵略、掠夺和好战本性并没有改变。正是从这一历史真理出发，莫斯科宣言有力地揭露了以美帝国主义为首的世界帝国主义是和平、社会主义和各国人民友好合作的敌人。美帝国主义者奉行着所谓的“实力地位”政策，力图建立他们对世界大多数国家的统治，并企图阻挠人类按照社会发展规律前进。莫斯科宣言指出，美帝国主义者和他们的帝国主义伙伴打着“反共”的幌子，力图使越来越多的国家屈服于他们的统治，力图消灭民主自由，威胁各国的民族独立，想要以新的形式给各国人民套上殖民枷锁，疯狂地反对反殖民主义运动，并且不断对社会主义国家进行敌对破坏活动。正如实践所证明了的，美帝国主义的政策过去和现在都企图这样来把资本主义世界的一切反动势力集结在自己的周围。这样美帝国主义就成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众凶恶的敌人。莫斯科宣言强调指出，这些反人民的帝国主义侵略势力所实行的政策使它们自取灭亡，自己造成埋葬自己的掘墓人。
    社论说，世界各国人民清楚地看到，在第二次世界大战以后，美、英、法等帝国主义以及它们的仆从，如何在印度支那、印度尼西亚、朝鲜、马来亚、怯尼亚、危地马拉、埃及、阿尔及利亚、也门和刚果进行了或者还在进行着战争策划，推行阴谋和侵略活动，反对苏联、人民中国和其它社会主义国家。同时它们顽固地拒绝裁减军备，拒绝禁止使用和生产原子武器和氢武器，拒绝就立刻停止试验这些武器达成协议，反对全面彻底裁军，继续进行所谓“冷战”，进行军备竞赛，不断建立新军事基地，实行破坏和平的侵略政策，造成新战争的危险。这是对帝国主义本性和由于以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义势力所奉行的侵略政策而恶化的目前国际局势的马克思列宁主义的估价。我们党从此出发经常教导我们，要避免战争，要使由于力量对比的变化而造成的避免战争的可能变为现实，要束缚住好战的帝国主义者的手脚，要使和平共处取得胜利，首先必须不断巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国之间的团结。这一团结是世界和平的决定性的保证。与此同时，必须把各国人民反对战争危险、反对帝国主义准备和发动战争的企图的斗争联合起来；必须提高群众的革命警惕性，并且不断地揭露帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义。不管帝国主义者采用怎样的策略，它们曾经是，并且仍然是战争爆发的现实的严重危险。生活证明，世界人民联合起来进行反对战争和侵略的斗争，就能够约制住侵略者。各国人民和他们的坚决行动能够束缚住帝国主义者的手脚。最近时期的国际事件最清楚地证明了，以美国为首的帝国主义者是和平的敌人，它正在狂热地准备战争，并且公然威胁各国人民的自由和独立。
    社论又指出，强大的社会主义阵营是帝国主义实现惨无人道的计划和侵略目的的主要障碍。美帝国主义及其忠实奴仆南斯拉夫修正主义者，正是要反对这个障碍，反对社会主义阵营和它的团结。莫斯科宣言强调指出，而且最近三年来又以新的具体事实证明了，修正主义是主要危险，它麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要求保持和恢复资本主义。作为帝国主义的代理人的现代修正主义在国际共产主义和工人运动中扮演了“特洛伊木马”的可耻角色。贝尔格莱德铁托集团举着现代修正主义的破旗。
    南斯拉夫修正主义者以自己的每天对社会主义阵营和和平的敌对活动，通过反革命阴谋，用颠复和间谍活动，用造谣和阴谋诡计，全心全意执行他们的帝国主义主子所交给的任务。因此，对和平和各国人民自由的头号的敌人、社会主义和共产主义的疯狂敌人美帝国主义的揭露，同对它的忠实奴仆——南斯拉夫修正主义集团的揭露，是不能分割的。我们党过去和现在都把对帝国主义及其代理人——南斯拉夫修正主义者进行政治上和意识形态上的原则斗争看作是自己的永久的现实的国际主义任务。我们党遵循着战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的不朽原则和莫斯科宣言的英明教诲，从来就把自己争取和平和社会主义的斗争，把争取和平共处的胜利的斗争同反对帝国主义者和他们的忠实奴仆——南斯拉夫修正主义者的斗争紧密地联系在一起。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，它的以霍查同志为首的列宁主义的中央委员会，我国全体人民，过去和现在都为争取贯彻历史性的莫斯科宣言的可贵的并经考验过了的教诲而进行坚决的始终不渝的斗争，因为这些教诲是争取社会主义和共产主义胜利、争取维护和平和各国人民之间的友谊的斗争中的有力武器。
