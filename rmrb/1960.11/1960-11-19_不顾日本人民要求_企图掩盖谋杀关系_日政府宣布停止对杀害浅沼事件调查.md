Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th dispatch: Disregarding the demands of the Japanese people to thoroughly investigate the behind-the-scenes relationships in the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office issued separate statements on the 17th, announcing the end of all investigations related to the incident.

In their statements, they also described the political conspiracy in which Yaji Yamaguchi, a member of the fascist organization "Pan-Asian Anti-Communist Youth League," assassinated Asanuma under the instruction of the US-Japanese reactionaries, as a "solo act" by the perpetrator, stating that "there is no accomplice relationship in law."

The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office admitted in its statement that investigations had revealed that some funds from right-wing groups came from large monopoly capital corporations. However, it deliberately protected them, saying that it was "not appropriate to disclose this during the election period" and that it would be announced at the National Assembly meeting after the general election.

At the same time, on the 17th, the Japanese National Public Safety Commission announced the lightest "disciplinary warning" to Kanekichi Teramoto, the chief of the Marunouchi District Police Station of the Metropolitan Police Department, in an attempt to cover up the relationship between the police authorities and the Asanuma assassination and to perfunctorily address the people's demands to punish the police officers involved in the incident. Teramoto was directly responsible for the "vigilance" work at the three-party speech meeting where Asanuma was assassinated while giving a campaign speech.

    不顾日本人民要求　企图掩盖谋杀关系
    日政府宣布停止对杀害浅沼事件调查
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：东京警视厅和东京地方检察厅不顾日本人民关于彻底查明杀害浅沼稻次郎事件幕后关系的要求，于17日分别发表声明，宣布结束对这个事件的一切有关调查。
    它们还在声明中把法西斯组织
  “全亚洲反共青年联盟”成员山口二矢在美日反动派指使下杀害浅沼的政治阴谋事件说成是凶犯的“单独行凶”，“在法律上并无共犯关系”。
    东京地方检察厅在声明书中承认，通过调查业已判明，右翼团体的一部分资金来自垄断资本大公司。但是它又蓄意加以包庇，说什么现在“因为是竞选期间不宜公开”准备在大选结束后召开的国会会议上公布。
    与此同时，日本国家公安委员会17日宣布给予警视厅丸之内地区警察署长寺本兼吉最轻微的“训戒处分”，企图借此掩饰警察当局与谋杀浅沼事件的关系，并敷衍人民关于惩办这个事件有关警务人员的要求。寺本当时是直接负责浅沼被害时发表竞选演说的三党演说会场的“警戒”工作的。
