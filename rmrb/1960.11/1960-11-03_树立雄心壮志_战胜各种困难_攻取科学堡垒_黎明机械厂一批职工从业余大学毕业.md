Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch: Thirty workers from Liming Machinery Factory recently graduated from the Liming Amateur University of Engineering, held at the factory. At the same time, thirty-six technicians and staff members also graduated. At the graduation ceremony held in the factory on October 27th, the factory director personally presented each of them with a university diploma. Three worker-students were also awarded the title of engineer due to their excellent performance.

The Liming Machinery Factory Amateur University of Engineering was established during the Great Leap Forward in 1958. The first batch of amateur university graduates are all outstanding workers and technicians with three to ten years of work experience. In the past two years, they have studied while working, attacking the fortress of science along the path of being both Red and expert, and have achieved good results in political, cultural, and professional studies. According to statistics from the 66 students in the graduating class, a total of 62 have been awarded the titles of advanced producer and Red Banner bearer by the factory and higher-level units. Among these students, Party members and Youth League members account for 85%. They have a relatively high level of political consciousness, a firm stance, listen to the Party, and have a strong sense of dedication. Through years of study, especially the study of political courses, their level of Marxist-Leninist theory has been rapidly improved, and they can begin to use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and solve problems.

In terms of professional knowledge, they have completed seventeen courses in the mechanical manufacturing process of engineering universities, including advanced mathematics, engineering mechanics, electrical engineering, electrochemistry, mechanical design, and mechanical drawing. Among the 25 graduation designs, a considerable part has reached China's advanced level. The automatic optical grinder designed by graduate and worker Zheng Xixiang and the multi-axis automatic lathe designed by Shan Rongxiang are both quite important innovations. Other graduation designs are also aimed at the factory and workshop's important production key points. In the graduation exam, 86% of the graduation designs received excellent grades, and there were no failures. Before graduation, the higher-level Party committee organized a graduate quality survey team composed of teachers from universities and scientific and technical personnel from relevant departments to conduct a detailed review of the first batch of amateur university graduates from Liming Machinery Factory in all aspects, from the test questions and papers of each semester, the courses to the graduation designs. The survey team unanimously agreed that these students are no lower than the level of full-time university graduates in terms of professional knowledge.

The excellent academic achievements of the graduates of Liming Machinery Factory's Amateur University are inseparable from the strong leadership of the factory's Party committee. The factory's Party committee often conducts political and ideological education for the students, encourages them to break superstitions, emancipate their minds, and establish the ambition to climb the peak of science. The Party committee also transferred a group of engineering and technical personnel with high awareness and certain production experience to serve as full-time and part-time teachers.

The workers have shown unparalleled heroic spirit in the face of attacking the fortress of science. Zheng Xixiang, a seventh-grade worker with thirteen years of work experience, originally had a poor cultural foundation, but he tried his best to overcome difficulties. If others studied it once, he would study it three or five times, and constantly humbly learned other people's good study methods. In less than a year, he became one of the top students. Four students, including electroplating worker Gao Jianlong, studied a complex project in their graduation design. In the past, many university teachers and students had also come to the factory to study this project, but without results; however, Gao Jianlong and others made 456 experiments in more than a month and finally succeeded in the research, increasing efficiency by 170 times and saving 200 laborers.

### 树立雄心壮志　战胜各种困难　攻取科学堡垒  黎明机械厂一批职工从业余大学毕业

    树立雄心壮志　战胜各种困难　攻取科学堡垒
    黎明机械厂一批职工从业余大学毕业
  据新华社2日讯　黎明机械厂三十名工人最近在工厂举办的黎明业余大学工学院毕业。与此同时毕业的还有三十六名技术人员和职员。在10月27日厂内举行的毕业典礼上，厂长亲手发给他们每人一份大学毕业证书，有三名工人大学生由于成绩优异，还获得了工程师的称号。
    黎明机械厂业余大学工学院是在1958年大跃进中举办的。这次毕业的第一批业余大学生，都是具有三年到十多年工龄的优秀工人和技术人员。他们在两年中边劳动边学习，沿着红透专深的道路进攻科学堡垒，在政治、文化和业务学习等方面都取得了良好成绩。据毕业班六十六名学员的统计，获得工厂和上级单位先进生产者和红旗手称号的共有六十二人。这批学员中，党员、团员占85％。他们政治觉悟比较高，立场坚定，听党的话，事业心强。经过几年来的学习，特别是政治课学习，他们的马列主义理论水平提高得很快，能开始运用毛主席思想来观察问题，解决问题。
    在专业知识方面，他们已学完工科大学机械制造工艺专业的高等数学、工程力学、电工学、电化学、机械设计、机械制图等十七门课程。在二十五项毕业设计中，有相当一部分达到我国的先进水平。毕业生、工人郑锡祥等设计的自动光学磨床和单荣祥等设计的多轴自动车床，都是相当重要的革新创造。其它各项毕业设计也都是针对了工厂和车间的重要生产关键。毕业考试中，毕业设计获优良成绩的占总人数86％，没有不及格的。毕业前，上级党委组织了一个由高等院校的教师和有关部门的科学技术人员组成的毕业生质量调查组，对黎明机械厂第一批业余大学毕业生，从各学期的试题、试卷、课程到毕业设计等各方面进行了细致的考查。调查组一致认为，这些学员在专业知识方面不低于全日制大学毕业生的水平。
    黎明机械厂业余大学毕业生能获得优异的学习成绩，是和工厂党委的坚强领导分不开的。工厂党委经常对学员进行政治思想教育，鼓舞学员破除迷信，解放思想，树立攀登科学高峰的雄心大志。党委还抽调了一批觉悟较高、具有一定生产经验的工程技术人员担任专职和兼职教师。
    工人们在攻取科学堡垒面前，表现出了无比顽强的英雄气概。具有十三年工龄的七级工人郑锡祥，原来文化底子很差，但他千方百计地克服困难，人家学一遍他就学三遍五遍，不断虚心学习别人的良好学习方法，不到一年工夫就成为优等学生之一。电镀工高俭隆等四名学员，在毕业设计中，研究一个复杂的项目。这个项目，过去许多高等学校师生也曾来工厂研究过，都没有结果；但高俭隆等在一个多月时间里作了四百五十六次试验，终于研究成功，使效率提高一百七十倍，节约出了二百个劳动力。（附图片）
