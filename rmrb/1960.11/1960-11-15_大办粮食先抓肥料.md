    To Vigorously Develop Grain Production, First Focus on Fertilizer
    Base and Systematize Fertilizer Accumulation
    The Gao'er Brigade of the Sanjiangkou Commune in Tuchang County, Liaoning, has established a farm fertilizer base centered on pig raising and proper management of human and animal waste. The entire brigade built six field livestock sheds, renovated pigsties, and newly built and renovated a large number of toilets and ash storage facilities, realizing livestock pens near the fields, toilets in every courtyard, and ash storage facilities where cooking is done, scientifically managing high-efficiency farm fertilizer. In addition, field fertilizer accumulation bases and green manure bases were established.
    In order to strengthen the planned management of fertilizer accumulation and production, the entire brigade implemented a five-fixed responsibility system: fixed quantity, fixed specifications, fixed remuneration, fixed costs, and fixed rewards and punishments.
    Sheep Manure Down the Mountain, Sheep Flocks Into the Fields
    Zhongwei County, Ningxia, launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign of "sheep manure down the mountain to make contributions, sheep flocks into the fields to offer treasures." The five survey teams organized by the communes discovered several sheep manure fields with the largest reserves, and then mobilized troops and generals to promptly haul back 362.2 million catties of sheep manure, which, calculated at 3,000 catties per mu, can be used as base fertilizer for 120,000 mu of wheat fields. At the same time, more than 12,000 sheep grazing in the South and North Mountains were all driven down the mountain and penned in the fields to accumulate fertilizer on the spot.
    Establish Concentrated Fertilizer Bases
    Yuanjiang County, Hunan, widely mobilized the masses to universally establish "concentrated fertilizer bases" at the ends of fields, roadsides, and all possible places.
    In the movement to establish concentrated fertilizer bases, all localities first, based on the principle of adapting to people and places, fixed the management and collection of concentrated fertilizer to individuals, adopting methods of contracting for accumulation, contracting for production, contracting for management, and contracting for completion of tasks. For example, cattle manure was contracted to cattle herders, pig manure to pig raisers, green manure to field managers, and nitrogen extraction from chimneys and grass ash to cooks.
    Determine Fertilizer Based on Pigs, Assign Tasks to Pens
    The Jizhai Brigade of the Xiaotun Commune in Linru County, Hunan, signed contracts with various pig farms and production teams for exchanging pig fertilizer for roughage, effectively mobilizing the enthusiasm of the feeders for accumulating fertilizer.
    In order to exchange for enough fodder, each pig farm implemented the method of "determining fertilizer based on pigs, assigning tasks to pens, and rewarding for exceeding the quota" for the feeders. Now, the average monthly fertilizer accumulation per pig has increased from more than 1,000 catties in May to more than 2,000 catties.
    Cash Purchase of Members' Fertilizer
    While carrying out political and ideological work, Miaotiao Brigade of the Luoxi Commune in Yishan, Guangxi, implemented a method of cash purchase of fertilizer, which made the members more enthusiastic about accumulating fertilizer. Since spring of the whole year, no member of the entire brigade has failed to complete the task of delivering fertilizer on time, and the quality of the fertilizer is also very good.
    Due to sufficient fertilizer and good fertilizer quality, the brigade's grain production has increased year after year, and the income of the members has continued to increase.
    Reasonable Quotas, Rewards for Exceeding
    The Party Committee of the Li Cao Commune in Huofen County, Shanxi, adhered to the method of three fulfillments, effectively mobilizing the enthusiasm of communes, districts, teams, and individual members for accumulating and producing fertilizer.
    The so-called method of three fulfillments is: adhere to the fulfillment of reasonable quotas; adhere to the fulfillment of rewards for exceeding the target; adhere to the fulfillment of remuneration.
    At present, the fertilizer accumulation remuneration of all members of the commune has been cleared up, all work points obtained by members participating in collective fertilizer accumulation have been included in the distribution, and the cash that members had not received in time for individual fertilizer accumulation has recently been fully paid after a general inspection.
    Collect Manure Before Freezing
    The Cuijia Management Area of the Daling Commune in Huaide County, Jilin, has now accumulated 89.6% of the planned manure. If this manure is not collected and dumped before freezing, it will not only be labor-intensive to collect and deliver manure this winter and next spring, but also concentrate the work, affecting other production. All production teams have comprehensively arranged labor, adopting a method of combining the organization of professional teams and mobilizing the masses to launch a concentrated attack, actively collecting and dumping manure.

### 大办粮食先抓肥料

    大办粮食先抓肥料
    积肥基地化制度化
    辽宁图昌县三江口公社高尔大队，建立以养猪和管好人畜粪便为中心的农家肥料基地。全队建田间畜舍六处，改修了猪圈，新建和改建大批厕所、灰仓，实现畜圈到田，院院有厕所，烧火地方有灰仓，把肥效高的农家肥科学地管理起来。另外，建立了田间积肥基地和绿肥基地。
    为了加强积肥造肥的计划管理，全队实行了定数量、定规格、定报酬、定费用、定奖惩的五定责任制。
    羊粪下山　羊群进田
    宁夏中卫县掀起了一个“羊粪下山立功、羊群进田献宝”的积肥运动。各公社组织的五个勘查组，发现了几个藏量最大的羊粪场，然后调兵遣将，及时拉回羊粪三亿六千二百多万斤，以每亩施三千斤计算，可供十二万亩麦田作底肥用。同时，还把在南山和北山上放牧的一万二千多只羊，全部赶下山来，在田间设圈，就地积肥。
    建立精肥基地
    湖南沅江县广泛发动群众，在田头、路边及一切可能利用的地方，普遍建立“精肥基地”。
    在建立精肥基地运动中，各地首先本着因人因地制宜的原则，把精肥的管理收集工作固定到人，采取包积、包制、包管、包干完成任务的方法。如牛粪包给看牛员，猪粪包给养猪员，绿肥包给田间管理员，烟囱取氮和草木灰包给炊事员等。
    以猪定肥　任务到圈
    湖南临汝县小屯公社季寨大队各养猪场和生产队签订以猪肥换粗饲料的合同，有效地调动了饲养员积肥的积极性。
    各猪场为了换回足够的饲草，对饲养员实行了“以猪定肥，任务到圈，超额奖励”的办法。现在每头猪每月平均积肥量已由5月份的一千多斤提高到二千多斤。
    现金收买社员的肥料
    广西宜山洛西公社妙调大队在进行政治思想工作的同时，实行现金收买肥料的办法，使社员积肥的劲头更大。全年春天以来，全大队没有一个社员不按时完成交肥任务，而且肥料质量也都很好。
    由于肥料充足，肥质良好，这个大队粮食连年增产；社员收入不断增加。
    合理定额　超额奖励
    山西霍汾县李曹公社党委坚持三兑现的办法，有效地调动了社、区、队和社员个人的积肥、造肥积极性。
    所谓三兑现的办法，即：坚持合理定额兑现；坚持超成奖励兑现；坚持报酬兑现。
    目前，全社社员的积肥报酬已经全部清理了，社员参加集体积肥所得工分全部参加了分配，社员个人积肥没有及时得到的现金，经过普遍检查，最近也全部付清。
    抢在结冻前起粪
    吉林怀德县大岭公社崔家管理区，现在已积的粪肥，占整个积肥计划的89.6％。这些粪肥如果不在结冻前起出、倒好，今冬明春起粪送粪不但费工，而且使活计集中，影响其他生产。各生产队已全面安排了劳动力，采取组织专业队伍和发动群众突击相结合的办法，积极起粪和倒粪。
