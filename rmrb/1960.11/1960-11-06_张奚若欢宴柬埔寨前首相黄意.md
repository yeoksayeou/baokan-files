Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet tonight to warmly welcome former Cambodian Prime Minister Hoàng Ận to visit China.

Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Baorhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultive Conference attended the banquet.

President Zhang Xiruo spoke at the banquet. He first extended a warm welcome to Mr. Hoàng Ận. He said that China and Cambodia are friendly, kindred countries. Our ancestors had friendly exchanges as early as 1,700 years ago. Especially in recent years, after both our countries have used the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit to handle relations between the two countries, our friendship has been further developed on a new foundation.

Zhang Xiruo said that in the past, the people of our two countries conducted resolute struggles to get rid of imperialist rule, and today we are also conducting a common struggle to consolidate our respective national independence, oppose imperialist subversive conspiracies and interference activities, and defend Asian and world peace.

Zhang Xiruo said that today, the people of our two countries face the common task of building their own countries. The Chinese people are pleased to see the brilliant achievements made by the Cambodian people in building their own country. It is particularly encouraging that economic cooperation, cultural ties, and friendly exchanges between our two countries are constantly developing on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We believe that the visit of Mr. Hoàng Ận, who is deeply loved by the Cambodian people, will further enhance our friendly and cooperative relations.

Mr. Hoàng Ận expressed his heartfelt thanks for the warm hospitality of the Chinese people in his speech. He said that he greatly admired the speed of China's leap-forward development in construction.

Hoàng Ận emphasized that China's great achievements in construction are due to the wise leadership of the Chinese leaders and the unity of the Chinese people. The united Chinese people have shown great strength. We believe that China's rapid development in construction will soon build China into a prosperous and strong country. We are happy for these achievements in China. The faster China develops and the greater its achievements, the happier we are. We Cambodian people are proud to have such a strong, sincere, and reliable friend like China. Prince Sihanouk's efforts to further enhance the friendly relations between Cambodia and China are very good and very correct.

Hoàng Ận said that the people of Cambodia and China have a long and profound friendship, and the people of the two countries share joys and sorrows together. He emphasized that the friendly unity between the people of Cambodia and China is as solid as a rock and cannot be destroyed by any force.

Cambodian Ambassador to China, Lan Nete, and his wife were invited to attend the banquet tonight.

The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, Ambassador Lan Nete, and others repeatedly raised their glasses to the friendship and unity between the people of China and Cambodia, to the prosperity and strength of Cambodia and China, and to Asian and world peace.

Also present at the banquet tonight were Zhuang Mingli, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Wang Youping, Chinese Ambassador to the Kingdom of Cambodia, and his wife, as well as people from all walks of life in the capital: Le Songsheng, Chen Shuliang, Wu Maosun, Zhu Yi, and Wu Xiaoda, etc. (Attached picture)

    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉出席了宴会。
    张奚若会长在宴会上讲话。他首先对黄意先生表示热烈欢迎。他说，中柬两国是友好、亲戚之邦。我们祖先在一千七百年前就已经有了友好往来。特别是在近年来，我们两国都以和平共处五项原则和万隆精神来处理两国之间的关系后，我们的友谊又在新的基础上得到了进一步发展。
    张奚若说，过去我们两国人民都为摆脱帝国主义的统治进行了坚决的斗争，今天我们也正为巩固各自的民族独立、反对帝国主义的颠复阴谋和干涉活动、保卫亚洲和世界和平而进行着共同的斗争。
    张奚若说，今天我们两国人民面临着共同的任务是建设自己的国家。中国人民高兴的看到柬埔寨人民在建设自己的国家中所取得的辉煌成就。特别令人鼓舞的是我们两国之间的经济合作、文化联系和友好来往在和平共处五项原则的基础上，正在不断地发展。我们相信，深为柬埔寨人民所敬爱的黄意先生的来访必将进一步增进我们之间的友好合作关系。
