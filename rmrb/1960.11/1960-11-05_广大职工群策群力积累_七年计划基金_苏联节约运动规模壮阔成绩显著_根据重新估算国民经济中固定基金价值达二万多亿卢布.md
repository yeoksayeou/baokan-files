　　Soviet Economy Drive is Grand in Scale and Yields Remarkable Results
　　According to Re-evaluation, Value of Fixed Assets in National Economy Reaches Over Two Trillion Rubles
　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th - In recent years, the broad masses of workers in various production sectors of the Soviet Union have achieved great results in the large-scale campaign to practice strict economy. In the past year and nine months alone, the workers nationwide have accumulated an additional "Seven-Year Plan Fund" of 22 billion rubles for the state through economical means. In the first half of this year, the total amount of electricity saved by various sectors of the national economy was equivalent to the total electricity produced by the Byelorussian Republic last year.
　　Blagoveshchenskaya, Deputy Minister of the Labor and Wages Department of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, recently told our reporter that since the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) last year, the most widespread and in-depth economy drive has been the "Seven-Year Plan Fund" accumulation campaign initiated by the workers themselves. The goal of this campaign is to save the state 100 billion rubles through the creative inventions and rationalization proposals of the workers themselves within seven years. At present, almost every production enterprise in the country has set specific targets for accumulating the "Seven-Year Plan Fund." The "Seven-Year Plan Fund" accumulated by the workers nationwide in the past year and nine months has reached more than one-fifth of the total target. Judging from the progress of the campaign this year, the speed of "fund" accumulation will accelerate in the coming years due to the increasing number of people making creative inventions and rationalization proposals. Not long ago, the workers of Sverdlovsk Oblast re-estimated their potential and revised the original target for accumulating the "Seven-Year Plan Fund." Now, innovators in twenty-seven oblasts of the Russian Federation and four other Union Republics are adding to the original targets. For example, the workers in Moscow originally planned to save 5 billion rubles in seven years, but now they have increased it to 8 billion rubles. The workers of the Gorky Automobile Factory and the Moscow Brake Factory have decided to achieve the goal of accumulating the "Seven-Year Plan Fund" in six and four years, respectively. Many innovators in enterprises have set individual plans for accumulating the "fund," and many are striving to accumulate more than one million rubles through rationalization proposals.
　　Blagoveshchenskaya said that saving electricity has been a very important part of the national economy drive since this year. In the first half of this year alone, the various sectors of the national economy have saved more than 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. This electricity was mainly saved through mass rationalization proposals, improved production equipment and operating methods, and strict implementation of inspection and supervision systems. In more than a year of the electricity-saving campaign, the masses have created many methods for saving electricity. Now, various regions are promoting methods and experiences in saving electricity.
　　Blagoveshchenskaya also said that the metal-saving campaign that started last year has also developed further. Over the past year, in addition to generally collecting scrap metal and saving metal consumption, many factories have launched competitions to produce more machines and tools with the saved metal to support agriculture. As of October 20 this year, the Moscow Ilyich Electric Motor Factory had produced electric motors and other products needed for agricultural production worth more than 3.4 million rubles with the saved metal.
　　When talking about the savings achievements of the construction sector workers, Blagoveshchenskaya said that last year, the construction workers nationwide saved the state 10.02 billion rubles by saving materials and reducing costs. In the first half of this year, they have saved 6.4 billion rubles.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th - According to the Soviet "Economic News," as of January 1, 1960, the value of fixed assets in the Soviet national economy was 2,011 billion rubles. If the fixed assets of collective farms and the property owned by individual residents are added, the total is about 3 trillion rubles. This material is the result of the first comprehensive re-evaluation of the fixed assets of the entire national economy in the Soviet Union.
　　According to this evaluation, the distribution of fixed assets in various sectors of the national economy is as follows: fixed assets in the industrial sector account for 27% of all fixed assets in the national economy, housing - 31.8%, transportation - 12.4%, agriculture - 14.1%, construction - 1.8%, and commerce and public catering - 1.4%. Among all fixed assets, production funds account for 58.7%, and non-production funds account for 41.3%. The evaluation results show that between 1913 and 1959, the proportion of production funds in all fixed assets almost doubled.
　　The evaluation materials show that the largest part of the industrial fixed assets - 20.3% - is concentrated in the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries, followed by the fuel industry, accounting for 17%, and then power stations and ferrous metallurgy, accounting for 11.9% and 9.6% respectively, and the food industry accounting for 9.1%.
　　The evaluation materials also show that the current distribution of fixed assets in various regions has also undergone great changes compared with the pre-revolutionary period. Before the revolution, more than 90% of the fixed capital was concentrated in the current Russian Federation and Ukraine. Now, the fixed assets in these two regions account for only 64% of the national fixed assets. The fastest growing fixed assets are in the Kazakh, Byelorussian, and Uzbek Republics.
　　The Soviet Union's re-evaluation of fixed assets began in September last year. The evaluation object included all state-owned and cooperative enterprises and organizations that implemented depreciation, with a quantity of approximately 1.4 million. The purpose of the evaluation is to determine the current situation and value of the Soviet fixed assets, as well as the technical level, degree of wear and tear, and its distribution in various sectors of the national economy. The "Economic News" article pointed out that the materials obtained from the re-evaluation will help to calculate the balance of fixed assets more correctly, determine the quality status of labor materials and the indicators of workers' technical equipment more accurately, which will also help to improve the planning work of the entire process of socialist reproduction. The re-evaluation of collective farm fixed assets will be completed in 1962.

### 广大职工群策群力积累“七年计划基金”  苏联节约运动规模壮阔成绩显著  根据重新估算国民经济中固定基金价值达二万多亿卢布

    广大职工群策群力积累“七年计划基金”
    苏联节约运动规模壮阔成绩显著
    根据重新估算国民经济中固定基金价值达二万多亿卢布
    新华社莫斯科4日电　近年来苏联各生产部门的职工群众在大规模开展的厉行节约的运动中取得了很大的成绩。单是在过去一年零九个月中，全国职工用节约办法额外为国家积累的“七年计划基金”，就达到了二百二十亿卢布。今年上半年，国民经济各部门节约的电力总量，就相当于白俄罗斯共和国去年一年所生产的电力。
    全苏工会中央理事会劳动和工资部副部长勃拉戈维申斯卡娅最近对本社记者说，自从去年开始执行七年计划（1959—1965年）以来，开展得最广泛和深入的节约运动，就是由职工自己发起的积累“七年计划基金”的运动。这个运动的目标是：要在七年内用职工自己的创造发明和合理化建议，为国家节约一千亿卢布的资金。现在，全国几乎每个生产企业都订出了积累“七年计划基金”的具体指标。全国职工在过去的一年零九个月中所积累的“七年计划基金”，已达到了总指标的五分之一强。从今年运动开展的情况来看，由于提出创造发明和合理化建议的人越来越多，今后几年内“基金”积累的速度还会加快。不久前，斯维德洛夫斯克州的职工重新估计了自己的潜力，又修改了原订的积累“七年计划基金”的指标。现在，俄罗斯联邦的二十七个州以及其他四个加盟共和国的革新者，都在追加原定的指标。例如，莫斯科的职工原定七年内节约五十亿卢布，现在已提高到八十亿卢布。高尔基汽车工厂和莫斯科制动器制造厂的职工，分别决定在六年和四年内达到积累“七年计划基金”的目标。许多企业的每一个革新者都订出了个人的积累“基金”的计划，许多人都争取通过提出合理化建议来积累一百万卢布以上的基金。
    勃拉戈维申斯卡娅说，节约用电是今年以来全民节约运动中很重要的内容之一。单是今年上半年，国民经济各部门节约的电力就已超过三十亿度。这些电力主要是通过群众的合理化建议、改进生产设备和操作方法、严格执行检查督促制度等办法节省下来的。在一年多的节约电力运动中，群众创造了许多节约用电的方法。现在，各地都在推广节约电力的方法和经验。
    勃拉戈维申斯卡娅还说，去年开展起来的节约金属的运动，也有了进一步的发展。一年来，除了一般收集废金属和节约金属用量外，许多工厂都开展了用节约下来的金属多生产机器和工具以支援农业的竞赛。莫斯科伊里奇电机制造厂到今年10月20日为止，已经用节约下来的金属生产了价值三百四十多万卢布的电动机和其他为农业生产所需要的产品。
    勃拉戈维申斯卡娅在谈到建筑部门职工的节约成就时说，去年一年，全国建筑工人用节省材料和降低成本的方法，为国家节约了一百零二亿卢布，今年上半年，他们已节约了六十四亿卢布。
    新华社莫斯科4日电　据苏联“经济报”报道，到1960年1月1日为止，苏联国民经济中固定基金的价值是二万零十一亿卢布，如果加上集体农庄的固定基金和居民个人所有的财产，那么总数约为三万亿卢布。这个材料是苏联对整个国民经济的固定基金作有史以来第一次全面重新估算以后得出的。
    根据这次估算，国民经济各部门固定基金配置情况如下：工业部门的固定基金占国民经济全部固定基金的27％，住宅——31.8％，交通运输——12.4％，农业——14.1％，建筑业——1.8％，商业和公共饮食业——1.4％。在全部固定基金中生产基金占58.7％，非生产基金占41.3％。从估算结果可以看出，在1913年到1959年间，在全部固定基金中生产基金部分几乎增加了一倍。
    估算材料表明，工业固定基金中最大的一部分——20.3％集中在机器制造业和金属加工业，其次是燃料工业，占17％，再次是发电站和黑色冶金业，分别占11.9％和9.6％，食品工业占9.1％。
    估算材料还表明，目前固定基金在各地区的配置情况，同革命前相比也有了很大变化，革命前90％以上的固定资本集中在目前的俄罗斯联邦和乌克兰。而现在，这两个地区的固定基金只占全国固定基金的64％。固定基金增长最快的是哈萨克、白俄罗斯、乌兹别克等共和国。
    苏联这次重新估算固定基金是从去年9月份开始的，估算对象包括了全部国营和合作社企业以及实行折旧提成的组织，其数量约达一百四十万个。估算的目的是要确定苏联固定基金的现有情况和价值，以及固定基金的技术水平、耗损程度和它在国民经济各部门中的配置情况。“经济报”的文章指出，重新估算所得的材料有助于更正确地计算固定基金的平衡，更精确地确定劳动资料的质量状况和工人技术装备程度的指标，这也就有助于提高社会主义再生产整个过程的计划工作。集体农庄固定基金的重新估算将在1962年完成。
