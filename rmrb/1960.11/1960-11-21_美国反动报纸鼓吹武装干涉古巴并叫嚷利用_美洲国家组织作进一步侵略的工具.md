Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th -- As Eisenhower ordered the deployment of U.S. naval and air forces in the Caribbean, U.S. newspapers vigorously promoted an attack on Cuba and revealed preparations to use the Organization of American States as a tool to take further aggressive action against Cuba.

The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article on the 18th by its Washington correspondent, David Lawrence, entitled "U.S. Armed Action Against Castro is Inevitable." Lawrence's article indicated that the United States had delayed "taking military measures in Latin America" in order not to affect voter turnout in the U.S. presidential election. Lawrence then said, "But the period of voluntarily taking a cautious approach has now clearly passed."

Lawrence then shamelessly said, "The day may not be far off when the United States sends troops to reclaim American property in Cuba that has been seized by the Castro government." Lawrence continued, "If the Castro government insists on its confiscation policy, then it can be said with complete certainty that what will follow is a formal break in diplomatic relations. Subsequently, European and Latin American countries will similarly refuse to diplomatically recognize the Havana government."

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" published an editorial on the 18th entitled "Flexing Military Muscle in the Caribbean," expressing its approval of the U.S. using the same forceful means it used in the Lebanon incident. The newspaper also said that warships, including aircraft carriers, had been flexing their muscles in the Caribbean for several weeks. The newspaper considered the shortcoming to be that the U.S. intervention "has a unilateral character" and did not pull the Organization of American States into this action.

The "New York Times" published a report on the 19th by its Washington correspondent, writing that "informed diplomatic sources said today" that "Guatemala and Nicaragua are planning to invoke the Rio Treaty to deal with Cuba's threat to their security." The reporter also said that these sources indicated that the two countries "will make this request to the Organization of American States within days." This shows that the U.S. has specifically arranged for its puppets to prepare to quickly manipulate the Organization of American States to take further aggressive actions against Cuba. The report also stated, "If the Rio Treaty is invoked, it could lead to the following steps: severance of diplomatic relations, interruption of economic relations, or use of force." The newspaper also pointed out that Guatemalan President Idígoras Fuentes had "suggested" taking "police action against Cuba like the United Nations took in Korea." (The London "Daily Express" correspondent in Guatemala also confirmed this conspiracy of Idígoras Fuentes. The reporter said that he also announced that Guatemala would be ready at any time with the forces needed to deal with Cuba's political actions. The reporter said that the Guatemalan president requested a meeting of the Organization of American States to "legitimize" actions against Cuba.)

However, even some American newspapers have had to admit that the U.S. government has no evidence that Cuba has interfered in the internal affairs of Guatemala and Nicaragua. The "New York Times" reporter reported from Washington that State Department officials believe that the United States "has no significant evidence" that Cuba participated in the anti-government movements in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and on the Nicaraguan-Costa Rican border this week.

The "New York Post" said in an editorial, "We strongly doubt that Castro is planning to attack Latin America." When talking about the heads of the Guatemalan and Nicaraguan puppet regimes clamoring to declare war on Cuba, the newspaper said: "We are playing a dangerous game."

### 美国反动报纸鼓吹武装干涉古巴并叫嚷利用  美洲国家组织作进一步侵略的工具

    美国反动报纸鼓吹武装干涉古巴并叫嚷利用
    美洲国家组织作进一步侵略的工具
    新华社20日讯　纽约消息：在艾森豪威尔下令在加勒比海出动美国海空部队以后，美国报纸大事鼓吹进攻古巴，并且透露已准备使用美洲国家组织这一工具对古巴采取进一步侵略行动。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”18日以“美国对卡斯特罗的武装行动是不可避免的”为题，发表了这家报纸驻华盛顿记者戴维·劳伦斯的一篇文章。劳伦斯的文章表明，美国为了不影响美国总统选举中选民的投票，曾拖迟了“在拉丁美洲采取军事措施”。劳伦斯接着说，“但是，自愿采取慎重态度的时期现在显然已经过去了”。
    劳伦斯接着厚颜无耻地说：“美国可能派遣军队把在古巴被卡斯特罗政府夺去的美国财产夺回来，这样的日子已经不远了”。劳伦斯接着说，“如果卡斯特罗政府将坚持它的没收政策，那么，可以完全有把握地说，接着而来的是外交关系的正式破裂。随后，欧洲国家和拉丁美洲国家将同样地拒绝在外交上承认哈瓦那政府”。
    “华盛顿邮报与时代先驱报”18日以“在加勒比海炫耀武力”为题发表社论，表示赞成美国使用了它在黎巴嫩事件中使用的武力手段。报纸还说，几个星期来包括航空母舰在内的军舰一直在加勒比海炫耀武力。这家报纸认为，美中不足的是，美国的干涉“带有单方面性质”，而没有把美洲国家组织也拉进这一行动中去。
    “纽约时报”19日刊载它的华盛顿记者的一篇报道写道，“今天据消息灵通的外交人士说”，“危地马拉和尼加拉瓜正在计划引用里约热内卢公约来对付古巴对它们的安全的威胁”。这个记者还说，这些人士表明，它们两国“将在几天内”向美洲国家组织提出这一要求。这就表明，美国已经具体布置了它的傀儡准备很快操纵美洲国家组织来采取进一步侵略古巴的行动。报道还说，“如果里约热内卢公约被引用的话，可以导致下列步骤：断绝外交关系，中断经济关系或使用武力”。这家报纸还指出，危地马拉总统伊迪戈拉斯·富恩特斯已经“建议”对古巴采取“像联合国在朝鲜所采取的警察行动”。（伦敦“每日快报”驻危地马拉记者也证实了伊迪戈拉斯·富恩特斯这一阴谋。这个记者说，他还宣布危地马拉将随时准备好对付古巴的政治行动所需要的部队。记者说，这个危地马拉总统要求召开一次美洲国家组织会议使反对古巴的行动“合法化”。）
    但是，甚至某些美国报纸也不得不承认，美国政府没有任何证据证明古巴干涉危地马拉和尼加拉瓜内政。“纽约时报”记者自华盛顿报道说，国务院人士认为，美国“没有重要证据”证明古巴参加本星期在危地马拉、尼加拉瓜和尼加拉瓜同哥斯达黎加边境上的反政府运动。
    “纽约邮报”在编辑部文章中说，“我们十分怀疑，卡斯特罗是否在计划进攻拉丁美洲”。这家报纸在谈到危地马拉和尼加拉瓜傀儡政权头子叫喊要对古巴宣战一事时说：我们在作危险的游戏。
