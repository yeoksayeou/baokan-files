Concentrate Forces, Grasp the Principal Contradiction
Yang Peiran, Secretary of the Party Committee of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant

    In an industrial enterprise, leaders face numerous tasks and problems daily that require analysis, research, and resolution. If efforts are spread evenly across all tasks, the result is inevitable entanglement in chaotic affairs, leading to a failure to grasp or manage anything effectively. What is the solution? It is necessary to grasp the principal, decisive problems. Chairman Mao stated in "On Contradiction": "In studying any complex process in which there are two or more contradictions, we must devote every effort to finding its principal contradiction. Once this principal contradiction is grasped, all problems can be readily solved."

    To grasp the principal contradiction, it is essential to be accurate. Therefore, it is necessary to frequently delve into the front lines, conduct investigations and research, analyze problems, and understand the essence and developmental laws of things. To grasp accurately, it is also essential to focus on development, that is, to discover and seek out the principal contradiction under the premise of developing production in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way. Only by solving the principal contradiction in this way can we improve production and promote work. Taking our Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant as an example, after the continuous Great Leap Forward of the past two years, the production level of open-hearth steelmaking has significantly improved. However, the number of furnaces is limited, and the capacity of the furnaces is limited. Can the production level continue to be significantly improved without increasing steelmaking equipment? This was the main problem we encountered at the beginning of this year. Therefore, we focused our leadership work on solving this problem. We adopted methods of vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution, learning from advanced experiences in other places, and, through the efforts of all employees, achieved tapping steel from three spouts, which increased the output per furnace by more than one-third, creating conditions for achieving continuous leap forward this year.

    However, the principal contradiction is not fixed. As things change and work progresses, contradictions will constantly transform. Under certain conditions, the original secondary contradiction will rise to become the principal contradiction. If the leadership work does not keep up, it will lead to passivity. After our open-hearth output problem was solved, the processes indispensable to steelmaking production, such as pig iron smelting and steel casting, appeared to be unable to keep up with the needs of open-hearth furnaces and rose to become the principal contradiction. Therefore, we concentrated our efforts on solving these problems, technically transforming the pig iron furnaces, investing new measures in steel casting, and mobilizing workers to continue vigorously promoting technical innovation and launching competitions. As a result, the output of pig iron furnaces greatly increased, and the speed of steel casting greatly accelerated, adapting to the requirements of open-hearth furnaces.

    To prevent the development of production from stagnating, in the movement to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, we also proposed a new goal of increasing the daily output of each open-hearth furnace from two heats to three heats. At this time, strengthening the coordination of raw material supply, transportation, machine repair, and all aspects of steelmaking production to ensure the shortening of smelting time became the principal contradiction. Therefore, we established a "Five-Combination Steelmaking Meeting" that was held once a day to address these issues (chaired by the factory Party secretary and director, with the participation of heads of steelmaking, material supply, transportation, and machine repair departments, and worker representatives). Taking steelmaking as the center, we grasped preparation and production by day, shift, and furnace, comprehensively cut down procedures and systems that affected coordination, and established systems that were conducive to coordination. At the same time, we widely mobilized employees to conduct ideological education centered on "steelmaking," improving their awareness of "wholeheartedly for steel," making production links tight and implementation step-by-step. As a result, in September, we basically achieved a daily output of three heats per open-hearth furnace, creating the highest monthly output record since the factory was built.

    However, leadership work concentrating efforts on grasping the principal contradiction does not mean that secondary contradictions and other minor contradictions can be ignored. Especially in a steel plant, where there are many production links and strong continuity, small problems and minor links, if ignored, will become big problems and affect the entire production. Therefore, we must not only concentrate our efforts on grasping the main problems but also not ignore the small problems. Only in this way can the work be free of loopholes and truly advance steadily. The "Five-Combination Steelmaking Meeting" is a way to both concentrate efforts on steelmaking and make overall arrangements for other work, mobilizing the forces of all parties to ensure the rise in steel production.

    Since the beginning of this year, our work has seen some improvements and achieved some results, mainly under the leadership of the higher Party committee, implementing Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses." Our enterprise is an enterprise of the people, and every employee is the master of the enterprise. They have a high degree of political and ideological consciousness and rich practical experience in production. Therefore, we must rely on the masses everywhere, follow the mass line, to run the enterprise well. According to this principle, we have adopted methods of launching mass movements in various tasks such as improving leadership methods, improving enterprise management, vigorously promoting technical innovation and technical revolution, and determining and arranging production plans, grasping key and weak links, widely mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and achieved good results.

    "From the masses, to the masses" has two links. The first link is "from." How can we "from" well? The key lies in revealing the bottom line to the masses. Before carrying out a task or launching a movement, it is necessary to tell the masses in detail about the tasks, methods, key points, favorable and unfavorable conditions, so that every mass can know the overall task and the responsibilities they bear in the overall task, and know where they can exert their strength. Only in this way can we improve the consciousness and initiative of the masses, take the initiative to offer suggestions, and proactively think of ways to overcome some difficulties encountered in the advancement.

    The second link is "to." How can we "to" well? There are two processes here. The first is the process by which the leadership concentrates the opinions of the masses, analyzes, summarizes, and improves them, and turns them into guidelines, policies, or systems. The second is the process of implementing the guidelines, policies, or systems and turning them into the conscious actions of the masses. In this regard, our experience is that whether it is the process of the leadership concentrating, analyzing, summarizing, and improving the opinions of the masses, or the process of implementing the leadership's determination and turning it into the conscious action of the masses, we must fully mobilize and rely on the masses. After the opinions of the masses are put forward, the leadership must analyze and improve them together with the masses. After forming a decision, rely on the masses to implement it. Only in this way can we concentrate well and implement well.

    The "Five-Combination Steelmaking Meeting" of our factory embodies this spirit of "from the masses, to the masses." At this meeting, the opinions of various departments and various aspects are put forward, and the representatives of various departments and various aspects analyze, summarize, and improve them together under the leadership of the Party committee, and then mobilize the masses layer by layer, arrange layer by layer, and implement the tasks to work sections, furnace platforms, and groups. In this way, the leadership and the masses are closely combined, and the upper and lower levels are of one mind and one heart, moving towards one goal.

    However, the leadership's determination has been implemented, the tasks have been implemented, and the measures have been formulated, but the leadership work has not ended. If the leadership does not grasp tightly and firmly, solve the new problems that arise in the process of the masses carrying out the tasks, does not delve into the front lines to firmly grasp the weak links, discover and support new things, the plan still cannot be well realized, and "from the masses, to the masses" still cannot be well implemented in a circular and repetitive manner. Therefore, after each "Five-Combination Steelmaking Meeting," we delve down in a planned and purposeful manner, and together with the masses, grasp inspection, grasp key points, and grasp the promotion of advanced experiences, and grasp shifts by shifts, furnaces by furnaces, and grasp each link tightly to ensure the realization of the plan. The result of doing so is that the "to" process prepares the conditions for the "from" process, and the "from" process lays the foundation for the "to" process, with better "from" ensuring better "to," and with better "to" ensuring better "from." So that the work progresses step by step and improves step by step.

### 集中力量　抓主要矛盾

    集中力量　抓主要矛盾
    中共天津第一钢厂党委书记　杨沛然
    在一个工业企业里，每天都有许许多多的工作和各种各样的问题摆在领导者的面前，需要分析、研究、处理。如果平均使用力量去抓一切工作，结果必然会陷于忙乱的事务之中，而且顾此失彼，什么都抓不住、抓不好。怎么办呢？这就需要抓主要的、起决定作用的问题。毛主席在“矛盾论”中说：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”
    抓主要矛盾必须要抓准，因此，就需要经常深入第一线，调查研究，分析问题，掌握事物的本质和发展规律。要抓得准，还必须从发展的角度上着眼，也就是说，要在多快好省发展生产的前提下，去发现和寻找主要矛盾，这样解决主要矛盾才能起到提高生产和推动工作的作用。拿我们天钢一厂来说，经过去年和前年的连续大跃进，平炉炼钢的生产水平已经有了大幅度的提高，而炉子的数量有限，炉子的容量有限，在不增加炼钢设备的情况下，还能不能继续大幅度提高生产水平？这就是在今年年初我们遇到的主要问题。于是我们就把领导工作的重点放到解决这个问题上面来了。我们采取大闹技术革新和技术革命、学习外地先进经验的办法，经过全体职工的努力，实现了三槽出钢，使炉产量提高了三分之一以上，为实现今年的连续跃进创造了条件。
    但是，主要矛盾并不是固定不变的，随着事物的变化，工作的进展，矛盾会不断转化，在一定的条件下，原来的次要矛盾就上升为主要矛盾，如果领导工作跟不上去就会形成被动。我们的平炉产量问题解决了之后，炼钢生产过程中必不可少的工序如化铁炉、铸钢等等，就显得跟不上平炉的需要，上升为主要矛盾。于是我们又集中力量解决这些问题，对化铁炉进行了技术改造，在铸钢方面投入了新的措施，同时发动工人继续大闹技术革新，大搞竞赛，结果化铁炉产量大大提高，铸钢速度大大加快，适应了平炉的要求。
    为了使生产的发展不致于停顿下来，在以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动中，我们又提出了使每座平炉由经常日产两炉钢提高到经常日产三炉钢的新目标。这时候，加强原料材料供应、运输、机修以及炼钢生产的各个环节的衔接，以保证缩短熔炼时间，就成了主要矛盾。于是我们又针对这些问题建立了每天召开一次的“五结合炼钢会议”（由工厂党委书记和厂长主持，吸收炼钢、材料供应、运输、机修等部门的负责人和工人代表参加），以炼钢为中心，按日、按班、按炉，一揽子地抓准备、抓生产，砍掉了影响衔接的手续制度，建立了有利于衔接的制度；同时，广泛发动职工，对职工进行以“炼钢为中心”的思想教育，提高了职工“一心为钢”的自觉性，使生产环环扣紧，步步落实。结果在9月份基本上实现了每座平炉经常日产三炉钢，创造了建厂以来的最高月产纪录。
    但是，领导工作要集中力量抓主要矛盾，并不等于可以置次要矛盾和其他小矛盾于不顾。特别是在钢厂，生产环节多，连续性强，一些小问题、小的环节，如果置之不理，就会变成大问题，影响整个生产。因此，我们既要集中力量抓主要问题，又要不忽视小问题。这样才能使工作不出漏洞，真正扎扎实实地前进。“五结合炼钢会议”就是既集中力量炼钢，又对其他工作进行统筹安排，调动各方面的力量，保证钢产量的上升。
    今年以来我们的工作有了一些改进，取得了一些成绩，这主要是在上级党委的领导下，贯彻了毛主席教导我们的“从群众中来，到群众中去”的方针。我们的企业是人民群众的企业，每个职工都是企业的主人，他们有着高度的政治思想觉悟和丰富的生产实践经验。因此，必须处处依靠群众，走群众路线，才能把企业办好。根据这个方针，我们在改进领导方法、改进企业管理、大闹技术革新和技术革命，以及确定和安排生产计划，抓关键和薄弱环节等各项工作中，都采取了大搞群众运动的办法，广泛调动了群众的积极性和创造性，收到了良好的效果。
    “从群众中来，到群众中去”有两个环节，首先一环是“来”。如何才能“来”得好？关键在于向群众交底。在进行一项工作、开展一个运动之前，要把任务、方法、关键、有利和不利条件等详细地告诉群众，使每个群众都能知道总的任务和自己在总任务中所担负的责任，知道自己有劲向什么地方去使。这样才能提高群众的自觉性和自动性，主动献计献策，遇见一些前进中的困难，也能主动去想办法克服。
    其次一环是“去”。如何才能“去”得好？这里有两个过程，第一是领导方面集中群众意见，加以分析、归纳、提高，变成方针、政策或制度的过程；第二是把方针、政策或制度贯彻下去，变成群众自觉行动的过程。在这方面我们的体会是：无论领导方面集中、分析、归纳、提高群众意见的过程也好，把领导决心贯彻下去变成群众自觉行动的过程也好，都必须充分发动群众、依靠群众。群众的意见提出来了，领导上要和群众一起分析、提高，形成决定以后，再依靠群众贯彻执行。只有这样，才能集中得好，贯彻得好。
    我们厂的“五结合炼钢会议”，就体现了这种“从群众中来，到群众中去”的精神。在这个会议上，把各部门、各方面的意见摆出来，各部门、各方面的代表人物在党委领导下一起分析、归纳、提高，然后层层发动群众，层层安排，使任务落实到工段、炉台和小组。这样就使领导和群众密切结合起来，上下左右一条心、一股劲，向着一个目标前进。
    然而，领导上的决心贯彻下去了，任务落实了，措施制定了，领导工作并没有完结。如果领导上不抓紧、抓狠，解决群众在执行任务过程中出现的新问题，不深入第一线狠抓薄弱环节，发现和支持新事物，计划还是不能很好的实现，“从群众中来，到群众中去”还是不能很好地循环往复地贯彻执行。因此，我们在每次“五结合炼钢会议”之后，都有计划、有目的地深入下去，和群众一起，抓检查、抓关键、抓推广先进经验，并且班班抓、炉炉抓，环环抓紧，以保证计划的实现。这样做的结果，就使“去”的过程为“来”准备了条件，“来”的过程又为“去”打下了基础，以更好的“来”保证更好的“去”，以更好的“去”保证更好的“来”。使工作一步步前进，一步步提高。
