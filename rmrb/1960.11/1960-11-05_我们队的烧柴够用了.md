    Our Team Has Enough Firewood
    Our Sanzhangpo Production Brigade is an economic crop area abundant in peanuts, and in the past, firewood has always relied on supply from outside. During this year's autumn harvest, the brigade adopted six specific measures to overcome the difficulty of insufficient firewood. These six measures are: First, seize the favorable time of the autumn harvest, organize auxiliary labor to collect firewood, and clean up all the stalks, leaves, and stubble of various crops; at the same time, organize the cutting of thatch and raking of leaves, so that all straw and leaves are brought home; Second, vigorously make coal briquettes, using sludge, crushed grass, and coal powder mixed together to make coal briquettes, one hundred catties of coal can be used as two hundred catties; Third, improve firewood burning techniques, formulate firewood quotas, and change from burning large bundles coarsely to burning small bundles finely; Fourth, improve stoves, and fully promote the use of backdraft stoves, which can save about 50% of firewood; Fifth, encourage everyone to go to the fields with a rope and knife, and bring back ten catties of firewood, requiring commune members not to travel empty-handed; Sixth, formulate reasonable work point assessment methods to increase the enthusiasm of commune members for collecting firewood.
    After taking the above measures, the whole team collected more than 43,000 catties of firewood and made 3,200 catties of coal briquettes in October; combined with improving firewood burning techniques and reforming stoves, the firewood needed by the team's canteen is already sufficient.

    我们队的烧柴够用了
    我们三丈坡生产大队是个盛产花生的经济作物区，历年烧柴总靠外地供应。今年秋收中，大队采取了六项具体措施克服了烧柴不足的困难。这六条措施是：一、抓住秋收有利时机，组织辅助劳力拾柴，把各种作物的秆、叶、茬都拾净；同时，组织割茅草、耙树叶，做到秸秆草叶全归家；二、大搞煤坯，用污泥、碎草和煤面混合做煤坯，一百斤煤可顶二百斤用；三、提高烧火技术，制订烧柴定额，改大把粗烧为小把细烧；四、改良炉灶，全面推行了回风灶，可节约烧柴50％左右；五、提倡人人上地带绳刀，回来十斤柴，要求社员路不空行；六、制订合理的评工记分办法，提高社员拾柴的积极性。
    采取以上措施以后，全队10月份就拾柴四万三千多斤，做好煤坯三千二百斤；结合提高烧柴技术和改革炉灶，全队食堂需要的烧柴已经足够用了。
