Zhouqiaozi Production Team Emerges with a Large Number of Activists

    (Reported by our newspaper) The Party Branch of Zhouqiaozi Production Team in Xindianzi Commune, Zunhua County, Hebei Province, uses the "snowball" method of party members leading activists and activists leading the masses to cultivate and establish a backbone team of more than one hundred activists. These activists are distributed on various production and work fronts, giving full play to their bridging role, and leading all men, women, and children in the village to work hard and practically, overcoming the drought that had not been seen in decades and achieving a bumper harvest.
    Zhouqiaozi Village is next to Zuoyangzhuang in the north, separated by a canal. The soil quality is similar, and they use water from the same canal for irrigation. However, last year, Zuoyangzhuang's grain yield was about 400 jin per mu, while Zhouqiaozi's grain yield, although also increased, averaged only 250 jin per mu. The Party Branch of Zhouqiaozi Production Team analyzed that the fundamental reason for the poor production was that the subjective initiative of the people had not been fully utilized. Most commune members were active in labor and had a strong sense of responsibility, but due to insufficient ideological and political work, the efforts of the people could not be twisted into a single rope, and their enthusiasm was not fully utilized. After finding this fundamental reason, the Party Branch immediately studied and improved its work, fully mobilized the masses, and aimed to catch up with Zuoyangzhuang. Under the specific guidance of the higher-level Party committee, the Party Branch convened a branch meeting and decided that branch members and general party members must first be outstanding combatants in their respective production units or work fronts, and must take the lead and set an example for the masses; at the same time, they must do a good job in mass work, with each party member cultivating three to five activists in order to better unite and lead the masses in production. Their methods of cultivating activists can be summarized into four words: "study, talk, lead, and entrust." Study means absorbing mass activists to participate in political study with party members, attend general party meetings, and learn the party's policies and guidelines. Talk means that party members communicate with activists individually, talking about the past and looking forward to the future to enhance the class consciousness of the activists. Lead means setting an example for activists in work style and methods, helping them improve their work ability, and constantly improving their work methods. Entrust means entrusting work to activists, letting them do it freely, and training them in practical work.
    Through these methods, all branch members and party members have cultivated a group of activists in various labor units such as production teams, pig farms, canteens, and vegetable gardens, so that there are core forces on every front and in every aspect.
    In order to expand the influence of activists among the masses and guide the masses to learn from them, the Party Branch used various forms of publicity to commend the advanced deeds of activists, so that the advanced ideas and advanced deeds of activists were deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, forming a good atmosphere of "learning from activists" among the masses. Then, the Party Branch launched a "learn, compare, catch up, and help" competition among the masses, and at the same time mobilized activists to link up with the masses around them to drive and cultivate more activists, promoting a new trend of the whole village striving for advancement.
    Under the leadership of the Party Branch and the drive of all cadres, party members, and activists, the masses of the whole village launched a competition movement of learning from the advanced among teams, groups, households, and individuals.
    After several months of work, at an appraisal meeting in early August this year, 108 model figures were selected, and the prestige of the "108 Generals" spread from then on. Under the leadership of the Party Branch, these activists united the commune members of the whole village on various fronts such as production, life, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, and vegetable planting, and effectively promoted various productions and work. In this year's production, the village encountered a severe drought that had not been seen in decades, and later suffered varying degrees of insect, wind, and other disasters, but all of them were overcome. As the villagers said: "With the strong leadership of the Party Branch, with our '108 Generals,' and with the unity of the villagers, even if Ping Shan Fort (a mountain south of the village) fell, we could still lift it up."

    支部认真选拔　党员积极培养　不断帮助提高
    周桥子生产队涌现大批积极分子
    本报讯　河北遵化县新店子公社周桥子生产队党支部，采用党员带动积极分子、积极分子带动群众的“滚雪球”的方法，培养建立起一支拥有一百多名积极分子的骨干队伍。这些积极分子分布在各个生产工作战线，充分发挥了桥梁作用，带动全村男女老幼苦干实干，战胜了几十年来没有过的旱灾，获得了丰收。
    周桥子村北边紧挨着左阳庄，两村相隔一条渠，土质差不多，又用同一条渠的水浇地。可是，去年左阳庄粮食亩产四百斤左右，周桥子去年粮食产量虽然也增加了，但是每亩平均只打粮二百五十斤。周桥子生产队党支部分析生产没有搞好的根本原因，是在于人的主观能动性没能得到充分发挥。大多数社员劳动积极，责任心强，但由于政治思想工作做的不够，大伙的劲头没能拧成一股绳，积极性没有充分发挥。党支部找出这个根本原因后，即研究改进工作，充分发动群众，向左阳庄看齐。在上级党委的具体指导下，党支部召开了支部大会，决定支部委员和一般党员，在自己所负责的生产单位或工作战线上，都要首先当一个出色的战斗员，一定要干在群众前头，给群众作榜样；同时也必须做好群众工作，每个党员要培养三至五名积极分子，以便更好地团结带动群众搞好生产。他们培养积极分子的方法，归纳起来就是“学、谈、带、交”四个字。学，就是吸收群众积极分子与党员一起进行政治学习，参加党的一般会议，学习党的方针政策。谈，就是党员通过个别串联，与积极分子谈心，回忆过去，瞻望将来，提高积极分子的阶级觉悟。带，就是在工作作风、工作方法上给积极分子作榜样，帮助他们提高工作能力，不断改进工作方法。交，就是把工作交给积极分子，放手地叫他们去作，在实际工作中锻炼他们。
    全体支部委员和党员，通过这样的方法，在生产小队、猪场、食堂、菜园等各个劳动单位，培养出了一批积极分子，使各个战线、各个方面都有了骨干核心力量。
    党支部为了扩大积极分子在群众中的影响，引导群众向他们看齐，把积极分子的先进事迹，运用各种宣传形式进行表扬，使积极分子的先进思想、先进事迹深入人心，在群众中形成了“向积极分子学习”的良好空气。然后党支部在群众中发动了“学、比、赶、帮”的竞赛，同时发动积极分子与自己周围的群众挂钩，带动和培养更多的积极分子，促成全村群众齐争先进的新风尚。
    在党支部的领导下，和在全体干部、党员以及积极分子的带动下，全村群众展开了队与队、组与组、户与户、人与人的学先进的竞赛运动。
    经过几个月的工作，在今年8月初一次评比会上，评选出一百零八名模范人物，“一百单八将”的威名就此传开了。这些积极分子在党支部的领导下，在生产、生活、养猪积肥、种菜等各个战线上，团结全村社员有力推进了各项生产和工作。在今年生产中，这村遇到了几十年来未有的大旱，后来还发生了程度不同的虫、风等灾害，但都被战胜。正像这村社员们所说的：“有支部的坚强领导，有我们这‘一百单八将’，有全村社员的一条心，平山堡（这村南面的一座山）倒了，我们也能把它扶起来。”
