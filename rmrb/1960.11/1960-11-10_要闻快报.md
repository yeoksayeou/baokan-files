Ningxia Winter Wheat Sowing Completed
This year, the winter wheat area in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has expanded by nearly 70% compared to last year. Irrigated areas along the Yellow River such as Zhongwei, Zhongning, and Lingwu, as well as arid mountainous areas such as Xiji, Haiyuan, Tongxin, and Yanchi, where winter wheat was rarely grown in the past, have all significantly increased their winter wheat planting areas this year compared to last year. The fields planted with winter wheat were generally plowed and harrowed two or three times, and basal fertilizer was applied, resulting in better sowing quality than in previous years.

Livestock from Pastoral Areas Winter in Agricultural Areas
More than 500,000 head of livestock from pastoral areas in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, have been transferred to agricultural areas for the winter.

Since the communization, Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture has transferred a large number of livestock from pastoral areas to agricultural areas for the winter every year. This makes it possible to utilize agricultural and sideline products locally and accumulate fertilizer locally, which closely integrates the mutually dependent and mutually promoting relationship between agriculture and animal husbandry. It has played a very good role in ensuring the continuous and comprehensive leap forward of agriculture and animal husbandry.

Guangxi Vigorously Plants Winter Tobacco
Guangxi has broken with convention this year and vigorously promoted the planting of winter tobacco. At present, more than 12,000 mu of seedlings have been cultivated throughout the region, and more than 4,100 mu have been transplanted.

In the past, Guangxi did not have the habit of planting tobacco in winter. It was not until last year that some areas began to try planting it. This year, the Autonomous Region has summarized last year's planting experience and decided that all localities should not only make full use of winter idle paddy fields for planting, but also expand the planting area by reclaiming wasteland, intercropping with sweet potatoes and vegetables, and utilizing scattered land in front of and behind houses.

Beijing Winter Vegetable Area Nearly Doubles
While focusing on the storage of autumn vegetables, Beijing is also focusing on the production of winter vegetables. As of October 28, the city had planted more than 80,000 mu of overwintering root vegetables and dozens of vegetables such as rapeseed, celery, cucumber, and kidney beans in greenhouses and sun-facing seedbeds. The planting area has nearly doubled compared to last winter.

While focusing on collective vegetable cultivation, many members of the communes have also planted winter vegetables on small plots of private land.

Hulunbuir League Launches Forest Protection and Fire Prevention Campaign
The Hulunbuir League in Inner Mongolia has launched a forest protection and fire prevention campaign.

While vigorously publicizing forest fire prevention work, all localities have rectified and improved fire prevention organizations, restored the joint defense system and mountain patrol activities, and many places have also organized training exercises. Under the guidance of the principle of centering on agriculture and comprehensively arranging work, a batch of manpower and materials has also been transferred. Using a combination of machinery, animal power, and burning, various firebreaks have been opened on both sides of the railway along the forest area and in the joint defense areas.

Timely Handling of Wet Grain to Prevent Mold and Rot
In the rush to harvest late rice, the communes in Anren County, Hunan Province, have adopted methods such as screening, carting, drying, baking, and stacking to timely handle the wet grain harvested in the rain, effectively preventing germination and mold.

In order to ensure the timely handling of wet grain, a deputy secretary of a general branch or team leader is specifically responsible for strengthening leadership in each brigade. At present, 2,085 earth-warmed grain baking rooms have been built in the county. It is ensured that 8.1 million jin of wet grain and some germinated grain have been properly handled in a timely manner.

Intercropping Grain in "Three Gardens"
Shucha Commune in Shucheng, Anhui Province, heavily plants summer-harvested crops in tea gardens, orchards, and other economic forests, especially in young forests. As of October 29, more than 7,600 mu of summer-harvested crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and peas had been intercropped in the forests.

Shucha Commune is a semi-mountainous and semi-hilly area with more than 30,000 mu of tea gardens, orchards, and economic forests.

Thoroughly Collect, Manage and Economize on Firewood
The Shengli Production Team of the Chengxi People's Commune in Jiading County, Shanghai, has tightly grasped the three links of collecting, managing, and using firewood in its "Three Autumns" work, so as to achieve thorough collection, good management, and economical use of firewood.

In order to collect more firewood, the Party branch has educated members to actively collect firewood while vigorously harvesting grain and cotton; selected experienced members to stack haystacks, ensuring ventilation and keeping them dry; and promoted fuel-efficient small-mouth backdraft heat-insulating stoves.

Accelerate the Development of Woody Oil Crops
Lushi County in the Funiu Mountains of Henan Province is vigorously developing woody oil crops. The county has more than 310,000 mu of walnut forests, initially forming a woody oil production base. At present, all people's communes are taking advantage of the walnut harvest season to carry out a mass movement to directly sow green-skinned walnuts, planting more than 86,000 mu in three days.
