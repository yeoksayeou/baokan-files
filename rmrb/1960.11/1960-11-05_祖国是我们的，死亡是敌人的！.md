    "The Motherland is Ours, Death to the Enemy!"

    These past few days, people all over the world have been watching as American imperialism intensifies its aggression against Cuba with swords drawn and bows bent. The American troops at Guantanamo Naval Base are restless and preparing for battle. American military camps in Guatemala and Honduras are also stepping up deployments, and transporting large numbers of special agents and counter-revolutionaries to land. In addition to military action, the United States is also creating an aggressive threat to Cuba by organizing economic blockades, fabricating political conspiracies, and recalling its ambassador to Cuba for a long period. It seems that the United States is determined to put this young country to death.

    Now, the heroic Cuban people have powerfully answered their enemy.

    On October 30th, the streets of Cuba's capital, Havana, and other towns across the country were again filled with the ranks of workers, farmers, government employees, professionals, and student militia. This was the general mobilization of the Cuban militia in the face of the imminent threat of armed aggression by American imperialism. Revolutionary flags were flying everywhere, and battle songs were soaring everywhere. People held weapons in their hands, full of fighting enthusiasm, ready to strike back against the enemy at any time. The Cuban people have shown the world their unwavering revolutionary style of being loyal to the revolution and daring to resist the "paper tiger" of the United States.

    American imperialists have blatantly expressed their ambition to invade Cuba. Eisenhower never forgets how to eliminate this country. A few days ago, he clamored again to occupy Guantanamo for a long time as a bridgehead for armed aggression against Cuba. Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy recently proposed a "five-point plan" for aggression and subversion against Cuba, to make Cuba "die prematurely."

    In fact, since the birth of the Cuban revolutionary government, the United States has never stopped its hostility and aggression towards Cuba, and the heroic Cuban people have also waged a series of tit-for-tat struggles against American imperialism.

    Not long ago, the United States organized and equipped armed bandits in the Escambray Mountains. Cuba's rebel army and workers and peasants immediately united to wipe them out, and executed the three captured Americans who had invaded Oriente Province.

    The United States unreasonably made things difficult for Cuban Prime Minister Castro when he attended the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The Cuban government immediately restricted the American ambassador in Havana from leaving designated areas during Castro's stay in the United States. The United States carried out economic sabotage against Cuba, and Cuba requisitioned American banks and took over oil companies. The United States reduced the import of Cuban sugar, and Cuba passed a law confiscating American property. Castro said it well: The United States reduces the import of Cuban sugar pound by pound, and Cuba will deprive American investment cent by cent, and not only that, he also said that for every conspiracy the enemy engages in, Cuba will do ten things. Recently, in order to counter the American economic blockade, Cuba announced the confiscation of all American enterprises, realizing the nationalization of all American enterprises. Faced with the imminent American aggression against Cuba, Cuba is "stepping up the organization of battalion after battalion of militia." Here, the contradictions and struggles between revolution and counter-revolution, and between national liberation movements and imperialism, are clearly placed before our eyes. This is a struggle of irreconcilable enmity; this struggle can be armed, or it can be non-violent, but no matter which one it is, it can only be resolved through struggle, and is irreconcilable.

    American imperialists hate the Cuban people who have stood up to the bone. Nixon gnashed his teeth and called Cuba an "intolerable malignant tumor in the Western Hemisphere." This just shows that the Cuban people are doing the right thing. Every revolutionary measure in Cuba has hit the United States imperialism where it hurts.

    "The principle of the reactionaries towards the democratic forces of the people is to eliminate those that can be eliminated, and to prepare to eliminate those that cannot be eliminated temporarily in the future" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume IV, page 1181). Under such circumstances, the revolutionary people have no other way to go but to struggle resolutely. In this regard, Cuba is a good example. It makes all the people of Latin America see that what the Cuban people can do, we can certainly do.

    The United States vainly attempts to conquer this country with its planes and cannons, but the flames of revolution can never be extinguished. Bombs can only make the armed Cuban people's will to resist aggression even firmer. They shout: "Every furrow will become a trench, every tractor will become a tank, every sugar mill will become a fortress, and every house will become a fortification...." This is the oath of a heroic people. It represents the voice of all Cuban people defending their sovereignty and expelling the invaders. The result will surely be like what the female student Nacha Santiago, who demonstrated on the streets of Havana, said:

    "The Motherland is ours, death to the enemy, we will win!"

    “祖国是我们的，死亡是敌人的！”
    江地民
    这几天，全世界人民都注视着美帝国主义剑拔弩张地加紧侵略古巴的行动。在关塔那摩海军基地的美国军队正蠢蠢欲动，进行着战斗准备。危地马拉和洪都拉斯的美军军事营地也正加紧部署，和运送大批特务和反革命分子登陆。除了军事行动以外，美国还以组织经济包围，制造政治阴谋和长期召回驻古巴的大使等，来造成对古巴的侵略威胁。看来，美国一心要把这个年青的国家置于死地。
    现在，英雄的古巴人民有力地回答了他的敌人。
    10月30日这一天，古巴首都哈瓦那和国内各城镇的街道上，又挤满了工人、农民、政府工作人员、自由职业者和学生民兵的队伍，这是古巴民兵在祖国面临迫在眉睫的美帝国主义武装侵略威胁下的战斗总动员。革命的旗帜到处招展，战斗的歌声到处飞扬，人们手执武器，满怀战斗热情地准备随时反击敌人。古巴人民向全世界显示了他们忠实于革命，敢于反抗美国这个“泥塑的巨人”的坚定的革命风格。
    美帝国主义者露骨地表白了他们侵略古巴的野心，艾森豪威尔时时不忘怎么消灭这个国家。前两天他又叫嚣长期霸占关塔那摩，作为武装侵略古巴的桥头堡。民主党的总统候选人肯尼迪最近还提出一个侵略和颠复古巴的“五点计划”，要使古巴“就地夭折”。
    事实上，自从古巴革命政府诞生之后，美国就从来没有停止过对于古巴的仇视和侵略，英勇的古巴人民也和美帝国主义进行了一系列针锋相对的斗争。
    前不久，美国组织和装备了埃斯坎布拉伊山区的武装叛匪，古巴的起义军和工农群众马上联合起来把它们清剿了。并且把捕获的三个在奥连特省入侵的美国人也执行了枪决。
    美国曾无理刁难在纽约出席联合国大会的古巴总理卡斯特罗，古巴政府紧跟着就限制在哈瓦那的美国大使在卡斯特罗留美期间，不得离开指定地区寸步。美国对古巴实行经济破坏，古巴就征用美国银行，接收石油公司；美国削减古巴糖的进口，古巴就通过征用美国人财产的法律，卡斯特罗说得好：美国一磅磅地削减古巴糖的进口，古巴定要一分分地剥夺美国人的投资，而且不仅如此，他还说，敌人每搞一个阴谋，古巴就要做十件事。最近，为了反击美国经济封锁，古巴就宣布征收美国所有的企业，实现了全部美国企业的国有化。面对着迫在眉睫的美国对古巴的侵略，古巴就“加紧组织一营又一营的民兵”。在这里，革命与反革命，民族解放运动与帝国主义之间的矛盾和斗争，鲜明地摆在我们的眼前。这是一场不共戴天、势不两立的斗争；这种斗争可以是武力的，也可以是非武力的，但，无论是哪一种，都只有靠斗争来解决，都是不可调和的。
    美帝国主义者对站立起来的古巴人民，恨之入骨，尼克松咬牙切齿地把古巴称作“西半球的一个不可容忍的毒瘤”，这正好说明古巴人民做得对，古巴每一个革命措施，都击中了美帝国主义的痛处。
    “反动势力对于人民的民主势力的原则，是能够消灭者一定消灭之，暂时不能消灭者准备将来消灭之”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷第1181页）。在这种情况下，革命的人民，除开坚决斗争，是没有其他的路可走的，这方面，古巴是个好榜样。它使所有拉丁美洲的人民看到：古巴人民能够做到的，我们也一定能做到。
    美国妄想用它的飞机、大炮来征服这个国家，但是革命的火焰是永远也扑不灭的。炸弹只能使武装起来的古巴人民反抗侵略的意志更加坚定，他们高呼：要让“每一条田畦将变成战壕，每架拖拉机将变成坦克，每一个糖厂将变成要塞，每一幢房子将变成防御工事……。”这是英雄人民的誓言，它代表了所有古巴人民捍卫主权和驱逐侵略者的心声，其结果一定会像那个在哈瓦那大街上示威的女学生纳查·圣地亚哥所说的：
    “祖国是我们的，死亡是敌人的，我们必胜！”
