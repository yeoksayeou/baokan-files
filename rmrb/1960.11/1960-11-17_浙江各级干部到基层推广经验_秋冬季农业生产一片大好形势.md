Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 16th - Party committee secretaries at all levels in Zhejiang Province led a large number of cadres to people's communes and production teams in various places. Together with local cadres, they publicized and implemented the Party's various policies, greatly improving the progress and quality of autumn harvest and winter planting. According to statistics from November 8th, the province had harvested over 15 million mu of late rice, sweet potatoes, and corn, and sown over 7 million mu of barley, wheat, broad beans, peas, and rape, and over 7 million mu of green manure.

When publicizing policies, leaders in various places paid attention to promoting the experience of carrying out "three guarantees and one reward" work and work-point recording, and also helped various production teams carry out labor competitions exceeding quotas, comparing quality, and carefully harvesting, so that the harvesting of late rice basically achieved no remaining ears in the fields and no remaining grains in the grass. More than 20 counties including Huangyan, Qingtian, and Yiwu not only harvested the sweet potatoes cleanly, but also harvested all the vines and leaves. In the production competition, various places also actively tapped the potential of the land to increase the planting of grain crops. In the Wenzhou area, in addition to striving to expand the winter planting area, the experience of high wheat yield in the Shixi Production Team of Qingtian County was also promoted. In addition, commune members also used spare time to plant grain and vegetable crops wherever possible, and many commune members also raised more piglets, chicks, and ducklings.

When publicizing various policies, leaders at all levels further promoted the fine style of eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses. Sun Zhaolong, secretary of the Qiantang Commune Party Committee in Hangzhou City, and Zheng Weikun, deputy director, lived in the homes of commune members from poor peasant backgrounds when mobilizing commune members in the Shizi Production Team to do a good job in autumn harvest and winter planting. During the day, they participated in labor, talking with commune members while working, soliciting their opinions, and publicizing the Party's various policies to commune members in the evening. They also discussed relevant policy issues with cadres and commune members, acting as advisors to the masses and enabling the Party's policies to penetrate the hearts of the people. Zhang Bangjun, secretary of the Tangcun Commune Party Committee in Chun'an County, insisted on discussing everything with the masses when working in the Tangcun Production Team, so that the spring flower three-guarantee targets were set actively and reliably, and the enthusiasm of the commune members for production was unprecedentedly high. Because leaders at all levels adhered to the "four togethers" (eating, living, working, and consulting together) and earnestly handled affairs in accordance with the Party's policies, they set a very good example for cadres at the production team and production brigade levels, so that they also attached importance to discussing matters with the masses, strengthened their policy viewpoints, improved their work style, and the relationship between cadres and the masses was close. The broad masses actively offered ideas and suggestions to cadres, helping cadres lead production well. For example, commune members of the Zhenglin Production Team of the Meijiang Commune in Lanxi County saw that there were still grains in the rice straw that had been threshed, and immediately suggested that the cadres organize re-threshing. In three days, they re-threshed more than 100 mu of late rice and harvested a lot of extra grain. Commune members of the No. 1 team of the Xiaya Production Team of the Yangcunqiao Commune in Jiande County actively requested to exceed the contracted output and expand the winter planting area, but the cadres could not think of a way to expand the winter planting area and were prepared to plow the grass seeds to plant wheat. When commune member Shao Biqi learned of this, he immediately consulted with the team leader and proposed to intercrop wheat in radish fields. As a result, the grass seeds were not plowed, and the wheat planting area was expanded from the original plan of 91 mu to more than 100 mu.

At present, with the in-depth publicity of the Party's policies in various parts of Zhejiang, the enthusiasm of the broad masses has been more fully mobilized, and a new upsurge of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain is rapidly sweeping across the province.

    浙江各级干部到基层推广经验
    秋冬季农业生产一片大好形势
    新华社杭州16日电　浙江省各级党委书记带领大批干部到各地的人民公社和生产队，和当地的干部一起，宣传和贯彻执行党的各项政策，大大提高了秋收冬种进度和质量。据11月8日的统计，全省已收晚稻、番薯、玉米一千五百多万亩，播种大麦小麦、蚕豆豌豆和油菜等春花作物七百多万亩，绿肥七百多万亩。
    各地领导干部在宣传政策的时候，注意推广开展“三包一奖”工作和评工记分的经验，并且帮助各个生产队开展了劳动超定额、比质量和精收细打竞赛，使收割晚稻基本上做到了田无遗穗、草无遗谷。黄岩、青田、义乌等二十多个县在收获甘薯时，不仅薯块收得很干净，同时还将薯藤、薯叶全部收割回来。各地在生产竞赛中，还积极挖掘土地潜力，增种粮食作物。温州地区在竞赛中除了努力扩大冬种面积外，还推广了青田县石溪生产队小麦高产的经验。另外，社员们还利用空隙时间，见缝插针，大种粮食和蔬菜作物，很多社员还增养小猪小鸡小鸭。
    各级领导干部在宣传各项政策的时候，都进一步发扬了和群众同吃同住同劳动同商量的优良作风。杭州市钱塘公社党委书记孙兆隆和副主任郑维坤，在狮子生产队发动社员搞好秋收冬种的时候，住在贫农出身的社员家里，白天参加劳动，边劳动、边和社员谈心，征求社员意见，晚上向社员宣传党的各项政策，并且和干部、社员一起商量解决有关政策问题，给群众当参谋，使党的政策深入人心。淳安县唐村公社党委书记张邦君在唐村生产队工作的时候，坚持事事和群众商量，使春花三包指标订得积极可靠，社员生产情绪空前高涨。由于各级领导干部坚持“四同”，认真按照党的政策办事，给生产队和生产小队一级的干部作出很好的榜样，使他们也重视和群众商量办事，加强了政策观点，改进了作风，干部和群众的关系密切，广大群众积极为干部出主意，想办法，帮助干部领导好生产。例如，兰溪县梅江公社政林生产队社员看到已打过的稻草中还有谷粒，立即建议干部组织复打，三天中复打了晚稻一百多亩，多收了不少粮食。建德县杨村桥公社下涯生产队一小队社员积极要求超包产，扩大冬种面积，但是干部却想不出扩大冬种面积的办法，准备把草子耕掉种小麦，社员邵毕其知道了这件事，立即找小队长研究，提议利用萝卜田套种小麦，结果草子没有耕掉，小麦种植面积从原计划的九十一亩扩大到一百多亩。
    目前浙江各地随着深入宣传党的政策，广大群众的积极性更充分地调动起来，一个更大的大办农业、大办粮食的新高潮，正在全省范围内迅速掀起。
