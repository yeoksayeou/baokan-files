Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, November 27th: Yi Bozhong's Red Flag Bricklaying Team of the First Construction Engineering Company of Guizhou Province has persisted in carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution. This year, with a one-third reduction in personnel, they have completed three years' worth of work. 95% of the projects are of excellent quality, and no safety accidents have occurred.

　　A distinct feature of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement of Yi Bozhong's bricklaying team is to focus on technical innovation based on whatever work they are doing, and to innovate wherever they go. Whenever they accept a new task, the team organizes workers to discuss innovation projects. Every time they arrive at a new construction site, they send people to survey the site, understand the situation, and formulate an innovation plan. In April of this year, after accepting the task of supporting the construction of an employee dormitory, they learned that the plastering task there was relatively large, so they rushed to produce ash washing machines and plastering machines, which increased efficiency by about thirty times, ensuring the early completion of this task. In mid-September, Guiyang City concentrated its efforts to tackle the finishing work of a batch of key projects. Yi Bozhong's bricklaying team was assigned the task of earthwork construction at one construction site. After receiving the task, the team sent technical instructors to the construction site twice to understand the situation. Based on the site conditions, they formulated an innovation plan to use trackless electric flatcars to transport earth and earth derricks to lift and unload, realizing the mechanized and coordinated production of digging, loading, transporting, and unloading, thereby improving construction efficiency.

　　In the technical innovation and technical revolution, Yi Bozhong's bricklaying team often pays attention to humbly learning from the advanced experience of fraternal units in other places and locally, and never becomes arrogant or complacent. From June of last year to the present, they have successively learned and promoted more than ten new operating methods and new machines, such as the "six-zero" bricklaying method, the "four-four" bricklaying method, universal workbench, and combined mortar spreader. These advanced machines and operating methods have played a great role in improving work efficiency.

    走到哪里就在哪里搞技术革新
    易伯仲泥工队完成三年工作量
    据新华社贵阳27日电　贵州省第一建筑工程公司易伯仲红旗泥工队，坚持开展技术革新和技术革命，今年在人员减少三分之一的情况下，已干了三年的工作量。工程质量95％达到优等，没有发生安全事故。
    搞什么活路就以什么为技术革新的主攻方向，走到哪里革到哪里，是易伯仲泥工队技术革新、技术革命运动的一个鲜明特点。每逢接受一项新任务后，队里都要组织工人讨论革新项目；每到一个新工地，都要派人查勘现场，了解情况，制定出革新方案。今年4月，他们接受支援修建一幢职工宿舍的任务后，了解到那里粉墙任务较大，便赶制了洗灰机、粉墙机，使工效提高三十倍左右，保证了这一任务提前完成。9月中旬，贵阳市集中力量突击一批重点项目的收尾工程。由易伯仲泥工队担任一个工地的土方施工任务。队里接到任务后，曾两次派技术指导员到施工现场了解，根据现场情况，制定了用无轨电动平车运土、土吊杆起吊装卸等革新计划，实现了挖、装、运、卸“一条龙”土机械化联动生产，提高了施工效率。
    易伯仲泥工队在技术革新技术革命中，经常注意虚心学习外地和本地兄弟单位的先进经验，从不骄傲自满。从去年6月到现在，他们已先后学习和推广了外地的“六零”砌砖法、“四四”砌砖法、万能工作台、联合铺灰器等新操作法、新机具共十多种。这些先进的机具和操作方法，对提高工作效率都起了很大作用。
