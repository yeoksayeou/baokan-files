　　Kunming Tractor Factory Fixes Equipment and Workers to Increase Parts Production

　　(Our dispatch) Kunming Tractor Factory in Yunnan Province has established the idea of proactively acting as a "supporting role," listing agricultural machinery parts as key products for production. This has resulted in an actual supply of agricultural machinery parts in the third quarter that is 83.5% higher than in the second quarter.

　　Since the beginning of this year, with the increase in agricultural machinery in rural areas, the demand for parts has also greatly increased, making batch production of agricultural machinery parts an urgent task. To adapt to the requirements of this new situation, the factory decided to shift the focus of the factory's main product production from the past emphasis on trial-manufacturing tractors and manufacturing gas generators to a three-pronged approach of trial-manufacturing, manufacturing, and parts production. Parts production was incorporated into the production plan, and two parts workshops were established, equipped with necessary machine tools and a certain number of personnel, specifically for manufacturing various parts needed both inside and outside the factory. At the same time, a batch of molds and fixtures were urgently produced to increase the output and quality of parts.

　　After the factory began batch production of parts, the prominent problem encountered was that the materials required for manufacturing parts had many specifications and high quality, which could not be met for a time. The Party General Branch promptly seized this weak link, strengthened laboratory work, implemented strict material allocation, and assigned an experienced veteran worker to be specifically responsible for material allocation. At that time, timely solving the technical problem of using white cast iron to manufacture piston rings was the key to ensuring an immediate increase in the production of piston rings. Therefore, leading cadres went deep into the workshops and conducted experiments on desulfurization and dephosphorization of white cast iron with the workers. After several experiments, piston rings were finally made of white cast iron, greatly increasing the output of piston rings.

　　The staff and workers carried out technical innovations in the manufacturing of parts, using idle and waste materials to make equipment themselves to meet the needs of batch production of parts. Due to the lack of high-frequency electric furnaces for heat treatment, the heat treatment workers built gas carburizing furnaces themselves to replace high-frequency electric furnaces. This not only met the needs of parts quenching, but also increased efficiency several times compared to high-frequency electric furnaces.

　　In order to increase the output of parts, the workers of Workshop No. 1 also manufactured their own steel sleeve furnaces, which increased production efficiency five times.

### 把农业机械配件列为重点产品  昆明拖拉机厂固定设备固定工人增产配件

    把农业机械配件列为重点产品
    昆明拖拉机厂固定设备固定工人增产配件
    本报讯　云南省昆明拖拉机厂树立主动当“配角”的思想，把农业机械配件列为重点产品进行生产，使三季度的农业机械配件的实际供应量，比二季度增长83.5％。
    今年以来，由于农村农业机械的增加，配件需要量也大大增加，成批生产农业机械配件就成为一项迫切任务。为了适应这一新形势的要求，这个厂确定把全厂主要产品的生产，由过去的以试制拖拉机、制造煤气机为主，改为试制、制造和生产配件三项任务并举，并把配件生产纳入生产计划，成立了两个配件工段，配备了必需的机床和一定数量的人力，专门制造厂内、厂外需要的各种配件。同时，赶制了一批工模夹具，以提高配件的产量和质量。
    这个厂开始成批生产配件以后，遇到的突出问题是制造配件的材料要求规格多，质量高，一时不能满足需要。党总支及时抓住这个薄弱环节，加强了化验工作，实行严格配料，并指派一名有经验的老工人，专门负责配料。当时，及时解决用白口铁制造活塞环的技术问题，是保证立即增产活塞环的关键，于是领导干部深入车间，和工人一道进行白口铁脱硫、脱磷的试验。经过数次试验，终于用白口铁造出了活塞环，大大增加了活塞环的产量。
    职工群众在制造配件中，大搞技术革新，利用闲置和废旧材料，自制设备，适应成批生产配件的需要。热处理缺乏高频电炉，热处理工们就自己动手，砌筑了气体掺炭炉，代替高频电炉。不但满足了配件淬火的需要，而且效率比高频电炉高几倍。
    为了提高配件产量，一车间职工还自己制造了钢套炉，使生产效率提高了五倍。
