This newspaper's Ningbo, 21st dispatch. The Three-Mountain Brigade (basic accounting unit) of the Three-Mountain Commune in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, established operational groups (i.e., work groups) under the team, which fully utilized the production enthusiasm of the commune members.

Zheng Mingyuan, the secretary of the Three-Mountain Commune Party Committee, discovered while participating in field production in the First Team that, of the twenty-nine women participating in the harvest, thirteen had switched seven different farm jobs in three days, affecting their labor efficiency. He found a similar situation in the Sixth and Seventh Teams.

Comrade Zheng Mingyuan decided to help the production team rectify its labor organization. First, all seventy-two male and female laborers were incorporated into operational groups and fixed in place. At the same time, short-term production plans were drawn up for a period of seven days. Based on the production tasks, the masses were mobilized to discuss and the farm work was assigned to the operational groups. Labor was rationally divided according to the strength of the labor force and the difficulty and size of the farm work, making use of each person's talents. Generally, an operational group has four to seven full laborers, supplemented by two to three semi-laborers.

After the implementation of the short-term plan arrangement, the team's plan was specifically arranged to the operational groups, the operational group leader was able to lead production in an organized manner, and the commune members were more confident and motivated to complete the plan.

In order to give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the operational groups, Zheng Mingyuan and the team cadres studied and believed that, under the unified leadership of the team, the operational groups should be given the following powers: according to the team's plan, the group has the right to arrange and schedule the labor force within the group, formulate the group's production plan, and implement inspection and evaluation systems. This not only reduced the burden on the team cadres, allowing them more time to participate in production and focus on overall work, but also clarified the division of labor. The captain and the group leader each had their responsibilities and cooperated with each other, making the team's production vibrant and greatly accelerating the progress of the autumn harvest and winter planting.

    发挥作业组战斗作用
    三山大队秋收冬种有声有色进度大大加快
    本报宁波21日电　浙江宁波市三山公社三山大队（基本核算单位）在小队下面建立操作小组（即作业组），充分发挥了社员的生产积极性。
    三山公社党委书记郑明元深入第一小队，参加田间生产时发现，第一小队参加收割的二十九个妇女，有十三个在三天中调换了七种农活，影响她们的劳动工效。他到第六、第七小队也发现类似情况。
    郑明元同志决定帮助生产队整顿劳动组织。首先把七十二个男女劳力全部编入操作组，固定下来；同时订出了七天为一期的小段生产计划，根据生产任务，发动群众讨论，采取农活派到操作组，并按照劳力强弱、农活大小难易，合理分工，因才使用。一般操作小组有四至七个整劳力，再搭配二到三个半劳力。
    推行了小段安排计划后，由于将小队计划一段段具体安排到操作组，操作组长领导生产有条有理，社员们对完成计划心里有了底，信心更足，干劲更大。
    为了充分发挥操作小组的积极性和主动性，郑明元又和小队干部研究，认为在小队统一领导下，应给操作组以下职权：根据小队计划有权安排调度本小组内的劳力，制订本小组的生产计划以及检查、评比制度。这样不仅减轻了小队干部的负担，使小队干部有更多时间参加生产，抓好全面工作，由于分工明确，队长、组长各有其责，各司其职，分工合作，上下一条心，使这个队的生产搞得有声有色，秋收冬种进度大大加快。
