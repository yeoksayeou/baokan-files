		News in Brief

	Organize Production Team Cadres to Study Policies
	The Qingcheng People's Commune Party Committee in Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, has adopted the method of going deep into the grassroots and implementing a "three-seven system" on a rotational basis to vigorously organize team cadres to study the Party's policies, improve their policy understanding, and improve their leadership methods. This has made team work more detailed, down-to-earth, and in-depth, effectively promoting the development of various tasks.
	In order to ensure that cadres can both study and produce without hindrance, they have adopted a rotational learning method, studying in two batches each time. The first batch thoroughly learns the policies, clarifies their thinking, and reaches a consensus before returning to the team to lead production. The second batch then continues to study. In this way, not only is it ensured that every team cadre has the opportunity to study the policies, but it also ensures that the learned policies are promptly conveyed to the masses and quickly transformed into the masses' actual actions.

	Guarantee a Strong and Robust Agricultural Labor Force
	In order to ensure a strong and robust labor force on the agricultural front, the health and pharmaceutical departments directly under the Hebei Provincial government have selected more than 220 cadres and technicians to form disease prevention and health care teams to carry out health and disease prevention activities in rural areas. This disease prevention and health care team is divided into eight brigades and one group, led by Han Qimin, Director of the Hebei Provincial Health Department, and Chang Cheng, Deputy Director, who departed on the 17th and 18th respectively to conduct inspections and supervision in various places and promote and assist in carrying out disease prevention and health care activities.

	Strengthen Political Work and Comprehensively Implement Policies
	The Party General Branch of the H湾 (He Wan) Brigade of the Majie Commune in Pingdingshan City, Henan Province, attaches importance to thoroughly and meticulously implementing the Party's various policies in rural areas in all its work, using policies to mobilize the production enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and commune members.
	In order to improve the policy understanding of all Party members and cadres and enhance their awareness of implementing policies, the branch has adopted four methods: "learning, discussing, recalling, and helping," which have achieved remarkable results. In order to organize Party members and cadres to regularly study the Party's guidelines and policies, the brigade general branch established a system of centralized learning once every seven days this spring. According to the principle of "learning what is needed for the job," each time it stipulates relevant policies and documents and purposefully raises several key questions for everyone to focus on thinking and in-depth discussion.
	Due to the thorough and correct implementation of the Party's various policies, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and commune members has been greatly mobilized, enabling agricultural production to achieve high-speed development.

	Hand Over Plans and Measures to the Masses
	In leading production, the Party General Branch of the Guangxing Brigade of the Guangxingzhou Commune in Yueyang, Hunan Province, insists on handing over production plans and technical measures to the masses for joint study, joint decision-making, and joint implementation, mobilizing the enthusiasm and initiative of the vast number of people and ensuring the smooth realization of various production plans and measures. This brigade is rich in grain and cotton. Although it has suffered six cold snaps and more than 70 days of drought this year, the sowing plans for various crops have been completed very well, greatly exceeding last year. The grain area alone has expanded by 40% compared to last year.

	Go Deep into Classes and Do Extensive Political Work
	The Party Branch of Xuzhou No. 4 Middle School has further strengthened political and ideological education, improved the political awareness of teachers and students, and achieved remarkable results in various tasks such as teaching, production, and labor. Over the past year, 482 outstanding students have been successively named "Three Good" and "Five Good" students, and 13 teachers have been named outstanding teachers at the provincial and municipal levels. The quality of teaching has also jumped to the ranks of advanced schools in the city.
	In order to infiltrate political and ideological work into teaching and business, the school leaders often go deep into the classroom to listen to lectures, participate in lesson preparation and business meetings, and help teachers transform their positions and viewpoints, improve their political and ideological level, and improve teaching. The leading comrades of the Party branch also frequently go deep into the front line, focusing on backward classes, to promote the more in-depth and meticulous development of political and ideological work in the entire school.
