(Report compiled by our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: Some Latin American friends currently visiting China recently met with Xinhua News Agency reporters and gave talks on the situation in Latin America, condemning US imperialist interference and provocations against Cuba and economic aggression against Latin American countries.

Dr. Vicentina Antuña Daviu, head of the Cuban Cultural Delegation, said: Prime Minister Castro's announcement that Cuba would nationalize all US monopoly enterprises has been warmly welcomed by the Cuban people. This is a just measure and a measure to safeguard national dignity. She said: "This is the happiest thing in my life." She firmly believes that with the support of the people of the world, the Cuban people will be able to defeat the conspiracies of US imperialism.

Jesús Antonio Valedón and Ramón Canales, representatives of the Communist Youth League of Venezuela, severely condemned the US imperialist economic blockade and military provocations against Cuba. They said that the people of Latin America have become more aware that it is necessary to stop the aggressive activities of US imperialism and defeat all US conspiracies.

Valedón pointed out that the Cuban revolution is also an example for other Latin American countries. The victory of the Cuban Revolution has inspired the Venezuelan people's struggle against US imperialism. He also pointed out that the Venezuelan people oppose the large estate system and the deep oppression of US imperialism.

Abelardo Villalpando, head of the Bolivian Cultural Delegation and president of the Bolivian Tomás Frías University, said: The revolutionary experiences of China and Cuba point out that if colonial and semi-colonial countries want to achieve complete and genuine national independence, they must persevere in a life-and-death struggle against imperialism and carry this struggle through to the end.

Villalpando said: "The Bolivian people resolutely support the Cuban people's armed struggle against US imperialism and the Algerian people's armed struggle against colonialism. Their struggle is a just struggle. The broad masses of peace-loving people around the world warmly support their struggle."

Head of Delegation Villalpando strongly condemned US imperialism for carrying out economic aggression against Bolivia and other Latin American countries under the guise of "aid."

He said: "Whoever believes that national industrialization can be achieved with the 'aid' of US imperialism is the biggest fool in the world."

Head of Delegation Villalpando said that the Bolivian people, like the people of other Latin American countries, resolutely stand at the forefront of the struggle against US imperialism. They are waging a resolute struggle for the nationalization of mineral and oil enterprises and against the International Monetary Fund plan that puts the Bolivian people in a state of hunger.

Nicolás Buenaventura, head of the Colombian Friendship Delegation, said that the Cuban revolution has set an example for the Colombian people's struggle. The victory of the Cuban people proves that it is not only possible to fight against US imperialism, but also to defeat it.

He said that the Colombian people have been unyieldingly carrying out the struggle against imperialism. Urban and rural workers are uniting to form the basic force of the struggle. He pointed out that the Colombian people are using all means to carry out the struggle, and they never neglect to use the people's armed forces to oppose the armed forces of the reactionaries.

Ofelia Uribe de Acuesta, chairman of the Colombia-China Friendship Association, also pointed out that the storm of revolution has come to Colombia from Cuba.

Isidro López, head of the Argentine Cultural Delegation, said, "Due to the intrusion of imperialist economic forces, the Argentine people's anti-imperialist sentiment is growing stronger."

He said: "In Argentina, the mass struggle to defend national interests and oppose imperialism is in full swing." He pointed out: "The victory of this struggle can only be achieved when workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and people of all strata who oppose imperialism form a united front under the leadership of the working class and its political party."

López pointed out: "Argentina's anti-imperialist national struggle must be combined with the struggle of all the people of Latin America. The Argentine people's struggle is completely consistent with the Cuban people's struggle, and the Argentine people fully support the Cuban people's struggle."

López said, "The prospect of the Argentine people's struggle can only be the victory of the Argentine people and the defeat of imperialism."

    古巴革命胜利证明美国侵略可以击败
    拉丁美洲各国人民正在团结起来加紧反对美帝国主义
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：正在我国访问的一部分拉丁美洲友人，于最近分别接见了新华社记者，就拉丁美洲局势发表谈话，谴责美帝国主义对古巴的干涉挑衅和对拉丁美洲国家的经济侵略。
    古巴文化代表团团长维森蒂娜·安图尼亚·达维奥博士说：卡斯特罗总理宣布古巴将所有美国垄断企业收归国有，受到了古巴人民的热烈欢迎。这是正义的措施，是维护民族尊严的措施。她说：“这是我生活中最愉快的事情。”她深信古巴人民在全世界人民支持下，一定能击败美帝国主义的阴谋。
    委内瑞拉共产主义青年联盟代表赫苏斯·安东尼奥·瓦来顿和拉蒙·坎拉来斯严厉谴责美帝国主义对古巴的经济封锁和军事挑衅行动。他们说：拉丁美洲人民已经更加认识到必须制止美帝国主义的侵略活动，击败美国的一切阴谋。
    瓦来顿指出，古巴革命对其他拉丁美洲国家来说也是一个范例。古巴革命的胜利，鼓舞了委内瑞拉人民反对美帝国主义的斗争。他还指出，委内瑞拉人民反对大庄园制度和美帝国主义深重的压迫。
    玻利维亚文化代表团团长、玻利维亚托马斯·弗利亚斯大学校长阿贝拉尔多·维约尔邦多说：中国和古巴的革命经验指出，殖民地和半殖民地国家要获得完全的真正的民族独立，必须坚持不懈地与帝国主义进行你死我活的斗争，并且把这一斗争进行到底。
    维约尔邦多说：“玻利维亚人民坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义和阿尔及利亚人民反对殖民主义的武装斗争，他们的斗争是正义的斗争。全世界广大爱好和平的人民都热烈支持他们的斗争。”
    维约尔邦多团长强烈谴责美帝国主义在“援助”的幌子下对玻利维亚以及其它拉丁美洲国家进行经济侵略。
    他说：“谁要是相信在美帝国主义的‘援助’下能够实现国家工业化，谁就是世界上最大的笨蛋。
    维约尔邦多团长说，玻利维亚人民和其他拉丁美洲国家的人民一样，坚决站在反对美帝国主义斗争的最前线。他们正在为矿产和石油企业的国有化，为反对把玻利维亚人民置于饥饿的国际货币基金计划下进行坚决的斗争。
    哥伦比亚友好代表团团长尼古拉斯·布埃纳万徒拉说，古巴革命给哥伦比亚人民的斗争树立了榜样。古巴人民的胜利证明：不但可以对美帝国主义进行斗争，而且可以击败美帝国主义。
    他说，哥伦比亚人民一直在不屈不挠地进行反对帝国主义的斗争。城乡劳动者正在团结起来，形成斗争的基本力量。他指出，哥伦比亚人民正在利用一切方式进行斗争，他们从不忽视以人民的武装反对反动派的武装。
    哥伦比亚中国友好协会主席奥费利阿·乌里培德·阿格斯塔也指出，革命的风暴已从古巴来到哥伦比亚。
    阿根廷文化代表团团长伊西特罗·洛佩斯说，“由于帝国主义经济势力的侵入，阿根廷人民反对帝国主义的情绪正在日益加强。”
    他说：“在阿根廷，保卫民族利益、反对帝国主义的群众斗争正方兴未艾”。他指出：“这一斗争的胜利只有在工人、农民、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级，以及反对帝国主义的各阶层人民结成统一战线，在劳动阶级及其政党的领导下才能取得。”
    洛佩斯指出：“阿根廷的反帝国主义民族斗争必须与全拉丁美洲人民的斗争结合起来。阿根廷人民的斗争与古巴人民的斗争完全一致，阿根廷人民完全支持古巴人民的斗争”。
    洛佩斯说，“阿根廷人民斗争的前景只能是阿根廷人民的胜利，帝国主义的失败。”
