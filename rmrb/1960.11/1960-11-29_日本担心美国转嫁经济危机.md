    Japan Worried About US Shifting Economic Crisis
    (Reported by this newspaper) The emergency measures taken by the US government to alleviate the dollar crisis by harming its neighbors have caused strong unease in Japan.
    Kyodo News Agency said in a news item on the 26th: "Many people believe that based on President Eisenhower's instructions aimed at reducing US foreign expenditure, the United States may soon exert pressure on Japan." The news agency said in another news item on the 27th: Japanese banks and financial circles believe that "the result of the United States further reducing dollar spending overseas will have an adverse impact on Japan's international balance of payments."
    Kyodo News Agency's report also showed that Japan will resist US pressure. Fearing that the United States will demand that Japan bear the costs of stationing troops, Kyodo News Agency wrote in the news, in a tone warning the United States: "Restoring the defense burden-sharing fee will not only lose the great significance of revising the Security Treaty, but will also, like the situation in West Germany, cause intense nationalistic resentment."
    Regarding the US attempt to dump large quantities of "surplus" agricultural products on Japan, Kyodo News Agency wrote: "It is a fact that the United States has expressed its hope to sell surplus agricultural products to Japan in activities such as the visit of US Secretary of Agriculture Benson to Japan. However, because Canadian wheat is of excellent quality, there is a problem with the United States selling wheat." As for agricultural products such as corn and sorghum, Kyodo News Agency simply stated: "In any case, there is currently no possibility of Japan accepting these agricultural products."

    日本担心美国转嫁经济危机
    本报讯　美国政府为了解救美元危机而采取的以邻为壑的紧急措施，在日本引起了强烈的不安。
    共同社在26日的一条新闻里说：“很多人根据美国艾森豪威尔总统发表的目的在于减少美国对外支出的指示，认为美国不久可能对日本施加压力。”这家通讯社在27日的一条新闻里又说：日本银行、金融界认为，“美国进一步节约美元的海外支出的结果，将会给日本的国际收支状况带来不利的影响”。
    共同社的报道还表明，日本将对美国的压力采取抗拒的态度。由于担心美国将要求日本负担驻军开支，共同社在新闻中用对美国提出警告的口吻写道：“恢复防御分担费，不仅会丧失改订安全条约的巨大意义，而且会和西德的情况一样，引起民族主义的激烈反感。”
    对于美国企图向日本大量倾销“剩余”农产品的问题，共同社写道：“在美国农业部长本逊的访日等活动中，美国曾经表示希望把剩余农产品卖给日本，这是事实。可是，因为加拿大小麦质量优良，所以美国出售小麦有问题。”至于玉米、高粱之类的农产品，共同社干脆地表示：“不管怎样，目前日本接受这些农产品的可能性是没有的。”
