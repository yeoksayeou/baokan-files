Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, November 14th. The Executive Committee meeting of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization successfully concluded here on the 13th. Committee members from twenty-three countries and sixty representatives participated in the meeting. The meeting was conducted throughout in a high-spirited anti-imperialist atmosphere. The representatives adopted several resolutions on further strengthening the unity among the peoples of Asia and Africa, and on strengthening the struggle against imperialism and colonialism to achieve complete independence.

The general resolution adopted by the meeting emphasized the thorough implementation of the resolutions of the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry in April this year, and exposed the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as enemies suppressing national liberation movements. The general resolution also advocated the immediate establishment of an anti-imperialist united front with the people of Latin America.

The general resolution called on world public opinion to pay attention to the imperialists' attempts to strangle the struggle of the peoples of all countries for independence. It condemned the imperialists for instigating the assassination of the prominent African political leader Félix Moumié. The general resolution also called on the peoples of all countries to seriously expose the various conspiracies carried out by imperialism under new disguises.

In a resolution adopted by the meeting calling for paving the way for genuine peaceful coexistence, it called on all independent countries in the world to cooperate in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It pointed out that peaceful coexistence between the colonial peoples and the anti-imperialist peoples on one side and the imperialist and colonialist systems on the other is impossible. Therefore, the Afro-Asian peoples will continue to struggle against the imperialist and colonialist rule, whether it is political, economic, or military; at the same time, they will continue to struggle for the abolition of military bases and military treaties.

The meeting enthusiastically adopted a resolution on the United Nations. This resolution exposed and condemned the United States for using the United Nations to infringe upon the interests of the peoples of all countries.

The resolution said: "As long as the United Nations is still under imperialist control and disregards the legitimate rights of the peoples of all countries, the Charter of the United Nations will never be respected by the United Nations, and this organization will never maintain its prestige and never satisfy the hopes placed in it by the peoples of all countries. The trust of the peoples of all countries in the United Nations will still be reserved, and the peoples of all countries will inevitably have to rely on their own efforts and unity to strive for their own independence through struggle."

The meeting also adopted a series of resolutions, resolutely supporting the struggle of the peoples of Asian and African countries against imperialism and for complete national independence.

In the resolution supporting the heroic Algerian people, the meeting particularly condemned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, headed by the United States, for participating in the war to massacre the Algerian people.

The resolution on the Congo firmly supported the legitimate government of Lumumba.

The resolution on Japan firmly supported the Japanese people's struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," striving to abolish U.S. military bases, and freeing Japan from U.S. imperialism.

The meeting adopted a resolution reiterating the demand for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, condemning the United States for obstructing the restoration of China's seat, and demanding the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's so-called representatives in the United Nations.

The meeting also adopted a special resolution supporting the just demands of the Cuban people and their heroic struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The suggestions adopted by the meeting regarding the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization affirmed the achievements of the Secretariat's past activities, fully clarified the Secretariat's task of opposing imperialism and the spirit of collective responsibility, and expressed approval of the Secretariat's new charter. At the same time, some other decisions were also made.

These suggestions will further promote the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Movement.

The meeting also decided to establish the Afro-Asian Solidarity Anti-Imperialist Foundation composed of China, Kenya, Indonesia, Cameroon, Morocco, the United Arab Republic, and the Soviet Union. The first meeting of the Foundation Committee will be held in Conakry.

At the invitation of the Indonesian Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, the Executive Committee of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization decided to hold the next meeting of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization in Bandung in April or May 1961.
