Along with the capital, Moscow, major cities and rural areas throughout the Soviet Union held parades and other celebrations.

    In the heroic city of Leningrad, a grand parade was held on the 7th. The people of Leningrad greeted this joyous holiday with outstanding production achievements. In the first ten months of this year, the city's enterprises manufactured approximately 700 new types of machines, instruments, and various mechanical devices. Preliminary designs were completed here for an extremely powerful 750,000 kW steam turbine generator and a 1,000,000 kW turbine.

    In the heroic city of Stalingrad, one of the largest contingents of marchers was the construction workers. In nearly seventeen years, approximately four million square meters of residential space have been built in Stalingrad, which is almost more than double the total residential space built in the entire three hundred and fifty years that the city existed previously.

    In the evening, from Kaliningrad in the west to Vladivostok in the east, and from Murmansk in the north to Yerevan in the south – all Soviet cities, villages, and workers' residential areas held their annual holiday garden parties.

    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联各地人民7日隆重而热烈地庆祝了自己的节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年。和首都莫斯科一起，苏联的广大城市和乡村都举行了游行和其它庆祝活动。
    在英雄的城市列宁格勒，7日举行了盛大的游行。列宁格勒人以出色的生产成绩迎接了这个美好的节日，在今年头十个月中，这个城市的企业制造了约七百种新式机器、仪器和各种机械装置。这里初步设计了七十五万瓩的极强大的汽轮发电机和一百万瓩的涡轮机。
    在乌克兰首都基辅，游行者高举着带有“M”（俄文地下铁道简称）字样的标语牌：他们在庆祝今年的十月革命节的同时，庆祝自己城市的第一条地下铁道线通车。

    在英雄的斯大林格勒市，游行者的最大的队伍之一是建筑工人队伍。近十七年来，在斯大林格勒建筑了约四百万平方米的住宅面积，这几乎比以前这个城市存在的整个三百五十年中所建筑的住宅面积总数还多一倍。
    晚上，西起加里宁格勒到东方的海参崴，从北方的摩尔曼斯克到南方的埃里温——所有苏联的城市、乡村和工人住宅区都举行了一年一度的节日游园会。在各个游艺场所，职业演员和业余文艺爱好者演出了精彩的节目。晚上八点钟，在莫斯科、各加盟共和国的首都和英雄城列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、敖德萨和塞瓦斯托波尔鸣放了礼炮，并放了鲜艳夺目的焰火。
