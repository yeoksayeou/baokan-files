Reading Notes
Starting with "Hui Hu Xing"
A Ying

When imperialism invaded China, in addition to using cannons and fleets, it also used cunning tricks through religious, "charitable," and cultural activities to understand the situation in China, find internal agents, and cultivate "lackeys who serve imperialism," "compradors and lackeys who are familiar with Western habits" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume IV, "The Bankruptcy of the Idealist Conception of History"), in order to strengthen the plunder of China, enslave the Chinese people, turn China into a semi-colony and colony, and even further, to achieve the conspiratorial goal of dividing China. American imperialism was even more so. As Chairman Mao pointed out in the article "'Friendship,' or Aggression?" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume IV): "Compared with other imperialist countries, American imperialism has, for a very long period, paid more attention to activities of spiritual aggression, extending from religious undertakings to 'charitable' undertakings and cultural undertakings."

In modern poetry collections, there are many poems that specifically target these situations, arousing people's vigilance. For example, Xie Weifan's "Xueqing Pavilion Poetry Collection" (also seen in "Nanyue Caotang Draft") Volume 3, "Hui Hu Xing" (written around 1865), is one of them. The poem says:

Last year the tiger entered my wall, this year the tiger shakes my bed.
Those sleeping soundly on the bed avoid speaking of the tiger, saying the tiger only eats pigs and sheep.
The tiger's intentions are cunning like a rat, enticing people to be its accomplice.
Alas, the villages are turned into tiger dens, who can stop the tiger coming and going?
Strong men press their swords and weep daily, vowing to eat tiger meat and exterminate the tiger clan.

The content of this poem reflects the development of imperialist countries' aggression against China around 1865. Imperialist countries entered China during the Opium War period and quickly ascended to the hall and entered the room, attempting to destroy our souls and change our spiritual outlook. At that time, some people failed to raise their vigilance, sleeping with the tiger, thinking they would not harm China, and even avoided calling them tigers. Imperialist countries, as cunning as rats, hid under the false pretenses of so-called religion, "charity," culture, etc., deceiving and enticing Chinese people to be their lackeys – "chang" (tiger's accomplice). Li Xing's "Tiger Accomplice Song" says: "The ghost of the accomplice is enslaved by the tiger, the tiger squats in the mountains, the accomplice spies on the road," which describes it even more clearly, that is, becoming the pawns of imperialism and internal traitors of China. As a result of this, in just over twenty years, churches and schools were established everywhere, even reaching remote villages, turning the villages into "tiger dens," tigers came and went, charging straight ahead, and no one dared to stop or question them. Only the patriotic Chinese people, witnessing this, were heartbroken, pressed their swords and wept, vowing to cleanse the imperialist forces from China and completely eliminate imperialism. This is also the result of imperialist countries hiding their ferocious faces and bestowing small favors in China (which is what the poem calls "milk." Chu Weikai's "Spreading Western Religion" says: "Joining the church brings joy of getting money," which is one example).

However, "tigers and wolves surround the sea borders," and the Qing government was also a traitorous government, so this wish was impossible to realize at that time. The terrible situation continued to develop. Zheng Guanying's "Luofu Daihe Shanfang Poetry Collection" (the 1909 edition is the most complete) reflects the most specific situation after this. He pointed out that these tigers and accomplices were all: "Traveling as detectives, spreading religion with many disagreements" ("After the Sino-Japanese War, Events Became Increasingly Urgent, Concerned About the Current Situation, Therefore Composed a Long Song"), that is, imperialists used the guise of traveling, preaching religion, etc., to plunder and conduct espionage activities. He recorded that "fifty years of trade," due to the rampant lawlessness of imperialist countries in China, religious cases occurred continuously: "People and religion often cause disputes, the situation is like ice and charcoal. Officials fear more trouble, dare not handle according to the law. Hasty attempts to settle, often fulfilling their wishes. At every turn, they肆意挟制, the national system is often轻嫚. Grievances cannot be redressed, and the people's hearts gradually dissipate" ("The Current Situation is Extremely Urgent, Especially Concerned and Thinking of Ways to Contribute"). The article "Discussing Current Affairs with Gentleman Pan Lanshi" is even more specific:

Westerners flaunt their strength and violence, while the Chinese people love simplicity and honesty. Honesty is killed by violence, and no grievance can be redressed. Some say there is no evidence, some say the evidence is not true. Some say they died of illness, and no scars were found during the examination. Some say it was accidental injury, and a fine of hundreds of silver is paid as compensation. The person is allowed to be visited and arrested, but no one knows where they have fled. They are treated as dead cattle and horses, which is unfair and inhumane. ... In short, by this time, imperialist countries were already "tiger tracks running rampant across half the globe" (Zeng Guangjun's "Recent Events Miscellaneous Feelings"), but in China, they plundered even more cruelly. As a result of the development of the situation, not only did "tigers and wolves think of satisfying their hunger," but even "dogs and sheep also flaunted their ferocity," and the vast majority of China's sovereignty was almost entirely in the hands of imperialist countries. Occupying borders, forcibly demanding concessions, and also "using the excuse of protecting and interfering in internal affairs," the so-called "or borrowing ports to berth ships, or renting land to build houses. Or managing the customs, or代邮传驿. Or planning to open mines, or training soldiers. Railways or承包工, national debt or borrowing撥款. Measures are摩不周, and陰謀多詭譎" ("Talking about Current Affairs with Westerners and Recording Feelings"), had already reached the point of "the country will not be a country."

The reason why the power of imperialist countries developed so quickly, so widely, and so deeply in China is precisely the result of them strengthening "activities of spiritual aggression," as Chairman Mao said. This is where American imperialism is more ferocious and cunning than other imperialisms, and the image becomes clearer later on. This is using the poems of the old democratic period to serve as an example to illustrate, and what is said is only one side of the image of the imperialist tiger. But such a ferocious tiger will not exist for long, "although the tiger is fierce, it cannot withstand many fists" (Zheng Cong's "Hui Proverbs"), and it will eventually turn into a street rat, a paper tiger, and be beaten to death.

    读书札记
    从《讳虎行》说起
    阿英
    帝国主义在侵略中国时，除了使用大炮、舰队外，还曾诡计多端的通过宗教、“慈善”、文化一些侵略活动，在中国了解情况、寻找内线、培养“为帝国主义服务的奴才”、“买办和熟习西方习惯的奴才”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷《唯心历史观的破产》），以达到加强掠夺中国，奴化中国人，变中国为半殖民地以及殖民地，甚至进而瓜分中国的阴谋目的。而美帝国主义更是如此，正如毛主席在《“友谊”，还是侵略？》（《毛泽东选集》第四卷）篇里指出的：“美帝国主义比较其他帝国主义国家，在很长的时期内，更加注重精神侵略方面的活动，由宗教事业而推广到‘慈善’事业和文化事业”。
    在近代诗集里，有不少诗，正是针对着这样一些情况，唤起人民警觉。如谢维藩《雪青阁诗集》（《南岳草堂稿》并见）卷三《讳虎行》（写作时期约在1865年），就是其间的一篇。诗云：
    去年虎入我墙，今年虎撼我床。
    床上鼾睡讳说虎，谓虎只食彘与羊。
    虎意黠如鼠，诱人作伥为人乳。
    可怜村坞化虎穴，虎来虎去谁能阻？
    壮士按剑日痛哭，终食虎肉赤虎族。
    这首诗的内容，反映了帝国主义国家，在1865年前后侵略中国的发展情况。帝国主义国家自鸦片战争时期打进了中国，很快的就升堂入室，企图摧毁我们的灵魂，改变我们的精神面貌。当时有一些人未能提高警惕，和老虎一道睡觉，以为他们不会伤害中国，还讳言他们是老虎。帝国主义国家，又狡猾得像老鼠一样，就掩藏在所谓宗教、“慈善”、文化等等虚伪的幌子下，骗诱中国人做他们的奴才——“伥”。李惺《虎伥行》云：“伥之鬼兮虎所奴，虎蹲于山，伥詗于涂”，这形容得更明白，就是成为帝国主义的爪牙和中国的内奸。这样进行的结果，在短短二十几年间，便弄得教堂、学校遍立，一直达到穷乡僻壤，使村坞都化成了“虎穴”，虎来虎往，横撞直冲，无人敢阻拦过问。只有爱国的中国人民，目击心伤，按剑痛哭，矢志把帝国主义势力从中国清洗出去，并彻底消灭帝国主义。这也就是帝国主义国家，掩藏起狰狞面目，在中国施舍小恩小惠（就是诗里所说的
  “乳”。褚维垲《传西教》篇所说：“入教喜得分金钱”，即其一例）所造成的结果。
    但“环伺海疆尽虎狼”，清朝的政府又是卖国的政府，这样的愿望，在当时是不可能实现的。恶劣的局势就继续的发展下去。郑官应《罗浮待鹤山房诗集》（1909年刊本是最足本），反映这以后的具体情况最多。他指出这些虎和伥都是：“游历任侦探，传教多龃龉”（《甲午以后事变日亟关心时局因赋长歌》），就是说，帝国主义者假游历、传教等名义，进行掠夺，进行间谍活动。他记录着“通商五十年”，由于帝国主义国家在中国的横行不法，教案不断发生：“民教常构衅，其势若冰炭。有司畏多事，不敢照律办。草草求了结，往往遂彼愿。动辄肆挟制，国体多轻嫚。冤屈不能伸，民心渐涣散”（《时事孔亟殊抱杞忧妄陈管见以备采择》）。《与潘兰史征君论时事》篇说的尤其具体：
        西客逞强暴，华人爱朴淳。淳为暴者杀，无一冤可伸。或云无证据，或云证不真。或云因病死，所验无伤痕。或云系误伤，罚补费百银，其人容访缉，不知何所奔。视同牛马毙，不公亦不仁。……总之，到了这个时期，帝国主义国家已经是“虎迹纵横走半球”（曾广钧《近事杂感》），在中国却掠夺得更加残酷。局势发展的结果，不但“虎狼思饱噬”，甚至“犬羊亦逞凶”，中国绝大部分的主权，差不多全掌握在帝国主义国家手里。侵占边疆，强索租借地，还“借词保护干内政”，所谓“或借港泊船，或租地筑室。或司总税务，或代邮传驿。或为开矿谋，或为训士卒。铁路或包工，国债或借拨。措施摩不周，阴谋多诡谲”（《与西客谈时事志感》），已经到达了“国将不国”的程度。
    帝国主义国家势力，在中国所以发展得这样快，这样广和深，正是毛主席所说，他们加强进行“精神侵略方面的活动”所赢得的结果。这是美帝国主义较之其他帝国主义更凶恶、更狡猾的地方，愈到后来形象就愈清晰。这是以旧民主主义时期的诗歌，来作为说明的例子，所说也只是帝国主义老虎形象的一个侧面。但这样凶恶的虎，是不会存在得长久的，“老虎虽猛，不敌拳多”（郑琮《荟谚》），终于是要变为过街鼠、纸老虎，被打死的。
