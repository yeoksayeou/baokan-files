Truly Handing Over the Party's Policies to the Masses
Ke Qin

Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Being good at transforming the Party's policies into the actions of the masses, being good at ensuring that every movement, every struggle of ours, is not only understood by the leading cadres, but also understood and grasped by the broad masses – this is a Marxist-Leninist leadership art." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, p. 1318). The Party Committee of Longfang Commune in Huangling County, Shaanxi Province, understands the importance of this leadership art. They always strive to truly hand over the Party's policies to the masses.

How can the Party's policies be truly handed over to the masses? Longfang Commune provides an experience, which is to convey the policies to the masses without any discount, mobilize the masses to conduct full discussions, understand the concerns of the masses, and do a good job of ideological education. Only by doing a good job of ideological work and truly implementing the Party's policies in the hearts of the masses can we truly hand over the policies to the masses. Any policy of our Party is a concentrated reflection of the people's will and wisdom and represents the interests of 650 million people. However, not everyone can immediately and thoroughly understand every specific policy put forward by the Party. This requires us to do work, explain the policies to the masses, understand the specific views of the masses, and conduct in-depth ideological education. How meticulous and specific is the ideological work of Longfang Commune! When they began to implement the Party's policies, they always conducted specific educational work from top to bottom, from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, layer by layer, according to the different characteristics of various people. In this way, the Party's policies are truly implemented in everyone's heart, forming a "one heart, one mind" spirit, a style of "doing what we say, working hard, working early and fast, and doing well."

But this is not enough. Ideological work should be continuously carried out with the in-depth implementation of policies. Because in the process of implementing policies, people's thinking will change with the development of the situation, so it is necessary to carry it through to the end, promptly understand the various specific ideological situations that constantly occur among the masses in the process of implementing policies, and continuously carry out ideological work. When the Longfang Commune achieved some success in implementing the Party's instructions to expand the autumn planting area, some commune members developed a blind sense of complacency. The commune Party committee promptly eliminated this mood, which ensured that the policy of expanding the autumn planting area was fully implemented. In this way, ideological work is implemented to the end, and the Party's policies will also be implemented to the end. In this way, we can truly hand over the Party's policies to the heart of every member of the masses completely and thoroughly and transform them into the actions of the masses.

According to the experience of the Party Committee of Longfang Commune, in order for the Party's policies to be truly handed over to the masses, cadres must first have a conscious and firm awareness of strictly implementing the policies. We must understand that policy is the life of the Party, and resolutely implementing policy is the most fundamental guarantee for doing all work well. The comrades of the Longfang Commune Party Committee understand this truth, so no matter how tight the work tasks are, they insist on policy first; as soon as the Party's policies come down, they immediately study them and quickly implement them among the masses. This is the seriousness that our Party's cadres should have towards the Party's policies. This is, in fact, the Party spirit that the Party's cadres should have. All comrades of grassroots Party organizations should have this seriousness and this Party spirit.

    把党的政策真正交给群众
    克勤
    毛泽东同志说：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。”（毛泽东选集第四卷1318页）陕西省黄陵县隆坊公社党委会懂得了这种领导艺术的重要，他们总是努力把党的政策真正交给了群众。
    党的政策怎样才能真正交给群众？隆坊公社提供了一条经验，这就是要把政策不折不扣地向群众传达，发动群众进行充分地讨论，并且要懂得群众的心事，做好思想教育工作。只有做好思想工作，党的政策真正落实到群众心上，才算把政策真正交给了群众。我们党的任何一项政策，都是人民意志和智慧的集中反映，代表了六亿五千万人民的利益。但是，党提出的每项具体政策，并不是每个人都能立即透彻地了解的。这就需要我们做工作，向群众讲明政策，并且了解群众的具体看法，深入地进行思想教育工作。隆坊公社的思想工作做得多么细致，多么具体。他们在开始贯彻党的政策时，总是从上到下，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，一层不漏地根据各种人的不同特点，具体进行教育工作。这样，就使得党的政策真正落实到每个人的心上，形成“一条心，一股劲”，“说干就干，埋头苦干，早干快干，干就干好”的风气。
    但只是这样还不够，应当随着政策的深入贯彻，不断地进行思想工作。因为在执行政策的过程中，人们的思想会随着形势的发展发生变化，所以一定要善始善终，及时摸清群众在执行政策过程中不断发生的各种具体思想情况，不断地进行思想工作。隆坊公社在执行党的扩大秋播面积的指示有了一些成绩的时候，部分社员产生了盲目自满情绪，公社党委及时扫除了这种情绪，才保证了扩大秋播面积的政策得到了完全的贯彻。这样，思想工作落实到底，党的政策也才会落实到底。这样，才能真正把党的政策原原本本、彻彻底底交到每一个群众的心上，变为群众的行动。
    根据隆坊公社党委会的经验，党的政策要能真正交给群众，干部首先要有严肃执行政策的自觉性和坚定性。必须懂得政策是党的生命，坚决执行政策是做好一切工作的最根本的保证。隆坊公社党委会的同志正是懂得了这个道理，因而不管工作任务多么紧，都要坚持政策先行；只要党的政策一下来，他们就立即研究，并且迅速地贯彻到群众中去。这就是我们党的干部对待党的政策应有的严肃性。这实际上也就是党的干部应有的党性。所有基层党组织的同志，都应该有这种严肃性，有这种党性。
