    Strengthening Collective Leadership, Implementing Policies, and Promoting Production
    Xiangxiang County Universally Establishes Core Groups in Rural Commune Work Groups

    (Our Dispatch) Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, has universally established core groups in the most basic production units of the people's communes – the work groups. Currently, more than six thousand one hundred and ninety of the county's eight thousand one hundred and five work groups have established core groups. The work groups that have established core groups have shown a vigorous new atmosphere in production, life, and ideology.

    Among the eight thousand one hundred and five work groups in Xiangxiang County, 80% of the work groups have achieved good results in production and life, and the broad masses of cadres and the masses have great enthusiasm for production. However, some work groups have fewer Party members and Youth League members, and the work group leaders lack work experience and have few methods, and they have not united the active elements around them, so the work is often passive. In order to reverse the backward situation of these work groups, the people's communes have adopted the method of selecting a few poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants who are active elements in the work groups, uniting them around the work group leader, and forming a leadership core. As a result, the Party's instructions and policies were implemented and production was promoted in a timely manner. Before the spring of this year, the Diaolouzi work group of the sixth production team of the Luohong Brigade in Yutang Commune was a relatively backward work group in the entire brigade. Although the group leader, Chen Guisheng (a Party member), was enthusiastic and dedicated to his work, he wanted to do a good job wholeheartedly, but because he did not unite the active elements around him, his work was not good enough. Since April of this year, a core group has been established in the group, uniting six poor peasant households and an active old lower-middle peasant around the work group leader, forming a strong leadership core and leading the masses to engage in production. After only half a year of hard work, a vigorous atmosphere has emerged in production, life, and ideology. Because production and life are well managed, the brigade Party branch has held three on-site meetings in this work group since April, and inserted a red flag.

    Due to the establishment of core groups in the work groups, the collective leadership and the backbone role of the core group members have been brought into play, and the political and ideological consciousness of the commune members has been generally improved. For example, the core group members of the first work group of the sixth production team of the Chongshan Brigade in Gushui Commune, after studying Chairman Mao's works in their work, adopted the method of "relying on the advanced, improving the backward, and driving the middle" to unite the masses. First, they inserted red flags among the masses and set up advanced models, and then organized the masses to study and discuss, and evaluated "five-good commune members" every ten days. This rapidly expanded the ranks of active elements in the work group, and the ideological awareness of other commune members also greatly improved. Throughout the county, through strengthening political and ideological education, the awareness level of commune members has also greatly improved, and active elements among poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants have continued to emerge. In this way, whenever various movements come, after the core group makes a decision, the active elements immediately take the lead in responding, and specific difficulties in work can be easily solved.

    In order to strengthen the leadership of the core groups, the Party committees of the communes have focused on helping to solve specific problems and further improving the leadership ability of the core groups. Yuan Qiuyun, the first secretary of the Qizi Commune Party Committee, went deep into the second work group of the first production team of the Meiping Brigade to help the group leader, Li Xiaping, solve the leadership method of how to rely on poor peasants and unite middle peasants. This work group quickly became the red flag of the 195 core groups in the entire commune, and the commune Party committee also organized the group leaders of various work groups to visit and study here.

    At present, the people's communes in the county are further adopting measures. On the one hand, they continue to quickly establish core groups in work groups that have not yet established core groups. On the other hand, they have decided to use the brigades and production teams as units to run training classes with the participation of core group members in the evenings to exchange work experience, so as to run each core group better.

    加强集体领导贯彻政策推动生产
    湘乡县在农村公社作业组普遍建立核心小组
    本报讯　湖南省湘乡县在各人民公社最基层的生产单位——作业组里，普遍建立核心小组。目前，全县八千一百零五个作业组，已有六千一百九十多个建立了核心小组。建立核心小组的作业组，在生产、生活、思想三方面都出现了一片旺盛的新气象。
    湘乡县八千一百零五个作业组中，有80％的作业组生产、生活都搞得很好，广大干部群众的生产劲头很大。但是，也有一部分作业组因为党员、团员少，加以作业组长缺乏工作经验，办法不多，也没有把周围的积极分子结合起来，工作就常常被动。为了扭转这一部分作业组的后进局面，各人民公社就采取了在作业组里挑选几名贫农和新、老下中农的积极分子，团结在作业组长的周围，使之形成一个领导核心。结果，及时贯彻执行党的各项指示、政策，推动了生产。于塘公社罗宏大队第六生产队吊楼子作业组，在今年春季以前还是全大队一个比较后进的作业组，组长陈桂生（党员）虽然工作积极热情，全心全意想把工作搞好，但由于没有把周围的积极分子团结起来，因此，工作做得不够好。今年4月份以来，组内建立了核心小组，把六户贫农和一个老下中农积极分子团结在作业组长的周围，形成了一个坚强的领导核心，带领群众大闹生产，只经过半年的努力，生产、生活、思想三方面就出现了一片旺盛的气象。由于生产生活搞得好，大队党总支从4月份起在这个作业组开了三次现场会，插上了红旗。
    由于在作业组建立起核心小组，发挥了集体领导和核心小组成员的骨干作用，社员政治思想觉悟普遍提高。如谷水公社崇山大队第六生产队第一作业组的核心小组成员，在工作中通过学习毛主席的著作后，对团结群众采取了“依靠先进，提高后进，带动中间”的方法，首先在群众中插红旗，树立先进的榜样，然后组织群众学习讨论，十天评一次“五好社员”。使这个作业组积极分子的队伍迅速扩大，其他社员的思想觉悟也有很大的提高。全县其它各地通过加强政治思想教育，社员的觉悟水平也有很大的提高，贫农和新老下中农中的积极分子不断出现。这样，每当各项运动一来，核心小组作出决定后，积极分子立即带头响应，工作上的具体困难都能迎刃而解。
    为了加强对核心小组的领导，各公社党委都搞了重点，帮助解决具体问题，进一步提高核心小组的领导能力。棋梓公社党委第一书记袁秋云深入到枚坪大队第一生产队第二作业组，帮助组长李霞平解决了如何依靠贫农、团结中农的领导方法，这个作业组很快成为全公社一百九十五个核心小组的红旗，公社党委还组织各个作业组组长在这里进行了参观、学习。
    目前，全县各人民公社正在进一步采取措施，一方面继续在没有建立核心小组的作业组中迅速建立核心小组，另一方面决定以大队和生产队为单位，利用晚间开办有各核心小组成员参加的训练班，交流工作经验，以便把各个核心小组办得更好。
