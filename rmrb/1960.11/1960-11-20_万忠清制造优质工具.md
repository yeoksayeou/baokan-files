Wan Zhongqing Makes High-Quality Tools
A Shashi Daily Reporter

Coming from afar
One afternoon, Ding Jiaoyan, an accountant at the Xuguang Machinery Repair Factory in Shashi, was attending to several customers from the countryside when a postman delivered a letter from Yunnan. Ding Jiaoyan opened the envelope and read: "The purchasing agent from the Shashi Toothbrush Factory brought a few burnishing knives with an '8' mark on them. We heard they were made by your factory. Please help us order a batch..."

In September of this year, one noon, Ding Jiaoyan was calculating accounts at the counter when suddenly a surprised and delighted voice came from outside the counter: "Accountant Ding, you've moved here! We've been looking for two days and finally found you!" Ding Jiaoyan looked up and saw two carpenters from Jingmen, holding a letter of introduction from the county committee, here to buy Shun "8" brand axes and planes.

Recently, orders for Shun "8" brand tools arrive almost daily. This is not only the case for the woodworking and bamboo weaving industries in the city but also in various counties of the Jingzhou Special District. Even some places outside the province, such as Hunan, Henan, Sichuan, and Yunnan, have come to order Shun "8" brand tools. Why do these Shun "8" brand tools have such a high reputation?

The Origin of Shun "8" Brand Tools
Shun "8" brand tools are the products of Wan Zhongqing, a blacksmith at the Xuguang Machinery Repair Factory. In the spring of 1954, several ironware groups in Shashi had just merged to form a handicraft cooperative. At this time, Master Wan Zhongqing carefully manufactured various tools and agricultural implements on a furnace in the cooperative, experimenting with steel tempering and studying styles. Farmers stood by the furnace giving ideas, and he improved the tools according to the farmers' suggestions. In this way, he always did more work than others every day. Master Wan has his own reasoning for meticulous forging: "We artisans support national construction by producing more good products. The tools we make are for workers and peasants to use. If people travel a long way to buy tools that cannot be used, it is a waste of money, a waste of raw materials, and a delay in their work, which affects national construction—that is a big deal."

From this time on, Master Wan added a Shun "8" mark to his products. Every time he produces something, he is meticulous and strictly checks the quality. If there is even a slight problem, he will not release it. After three or four months, Shun "8" brand tools became famous far and wide.

Creating with Users
For several years, veteran blacksmith Wan Zhongqing has consistently worked with old technicians and users in the woodworking, bamboo weaving, and rattan industries to jointly research, design, and improve products. He often interacts with carpenters from the Shashi Furniture Factory, Prefabricated Parts Factory, Machinery Factory No. 1, General Machinery Factory, Bamboo and Rattan Cooperative, and Jingzhou Jiangling Iron and Wood Agricultural Tool Factory to jointly study the production methods of various woodworking and bamboo weaving tools. Master Wan Zhongqing has consistently cooperated with users for a long time. He carefully investigates the preferences and characteristics of users in various regions. He has a clear understanding of the styles, steel tempering, and performance of tools used by woodworkers and bamboo weavers in Shashi, the mountainous areas of Jingzhou, the lake areas, the Jiangnan region, the Jiangbei region, or Mianyang, Yiyang, and Sichuan.

In 1956, his old friend Wang Xiangzhen was working at the Jianli County Shipyard when he encountered a large tree that two people could barely embrace, and he could not saw it open. He rushed to Shashi and went to Wan Zhongqing's home to study how to make a new type of saw blade. The two of them studied from home to the cooperative. For a whole day, Wang Xiangzhen squatted by the furnace giving ideas, and Master Wan modified the tool according to his suggestions, carefully forging a large frame saw. Early in the morning of the third day, Wang Xiangzhen rushed back to the factory and cut open the tree at once.

In September of this year, Wang Xiangzhen and three carpentry masters from the factory went to the mountains of Jingmen to saw lumber, taking along the saw that had already been worn down to only two-tenths of an inch wide. Woodworkers from Jingmen Nanqiao, Tianmen, Mianyang, Qianjiang, and Shishou counties were also sawing lumber there. Compared with the woodworkers from various counties, the saw that Wang Xiangzhen used, even though it was only two-tenths of an inch wide, was extremely sharp, sawing with a "whoosh" sound, sawing quickly, with a clear kerf, high efficiency, and ease, and the sawn lumber was flat. The woodworkers from various counties in Jingzhou watched and praised it, asking Wang Xiangzhen to write a letter of introduction to order tools from Master Wan Zhongqing. (Attached picture)

    万忠清制造优质工具
    沙市日报记者
    不远千里而来
    一天下午，湖北沙市旭光机械修配厂会计丁家燕正在招呼几个从农村来的顾客，这时邮递员送来一封云南来的信。丁会计打开信封一看，信上写道：“沙市牙刷厂采购员带来几把绷刀，上面有个‘8’字记号，听说是你厂出品，请你们一定帮我们打一批……”
    今年9月间，又是一个中午，丁家燕正在柜台里算账，忽然从柜台外面传来一阵又惊又喜的声音：“丁会计，你们搬到这里来了呀！我们找了两天，总算把你们找到了！”丁家燕抬头一看，原来是荆门来的两个木工，手里拿着县委写的介绍信，是来买顺“8”号斧头、刨刀的。
    最近，要顺“8”号工具的订货单，几乎天天都有。不仅市内的木、篾行业如此，在荆州专区各县也是一样。就连省外的湖南、河南、四川、云南一些地方，也有找上门来订购顺“8”号工具的。为什么这顺“8”号工具有这么高的信誉呢？
    顺“8”号工具的来历
    顺“8”号工具是旭光机械修配厂锻工万忠清的产品。1954年春天，沙市几个铁器组刚刚合并起来，组成了一个手工业合作社。这时，万忠清师傅就在合作社的一盘炉子上精心制造各种工具、农具，试验钢火、研究式样。农民守在炉子旁边出主意，他就照着农民的意见改进。这样，他每天总要比别人干的活路多。万师傅精心锻造自有一番道理：“我们做手艺的人支援国家建设，就是要多生产一点好产品。我们打的工具是要工人、农民拿去用的，人家老远的跑来买回去的工具不能用，又浪费钱，又浪费了原材料，又误了人家的工，影响了国家建设是大事。”
    从这个时候起，万师傅又在自己的产品上，编了一个顺“8”字记号。每次生产时，细心入微，严格检查质量，有一点毛病就不出手。三四个月后，顺“8”号工具就在远近出了名。
    和用户一道创造
    数年来，老锻工万忠清都一直坚持和木器、竹器、藤器行业的老技工、老用户结合起来，一道研究设计改进产品。他和沙市家具厂、预制厂、机械一厂、通用机械厂、竹藤器社以及荆州江陵铁木农具厂的一些木工经常来往，一块研究各种木工篾工工具的制作方法。万忠清师傅就这样长期坚持和用户合作。他细心调查各地用户的喜好和特点，对沙市的、荆州山区的、湖区的、江南的、江北的，或是沔阳、益阳、四川的木工篾工用的工具式样、钢火、性能，都摸得一清二楚。
    1956年，他的老朋友王祥珍在监利县造船厂工作，遇到了一棵两人合抱的大树，锯不开。他便急忙赶到沙市，跑到万忠清家里研究打一把新式锯条，两个人从家里又研究到社里。整整一天，王祥珍蹲在炉子旁边出主意，万师傅就照着他的意见改，精心打了一把大盖锯，第三天王祥珍一大清早就赶回工厂，一下子就把那棵大树裁开了。
    今年9月，王祥珍和厂里的三个木匠师傅，在荆门山里锯木料，把已经用得只剩下两分宽的锯子也带去了。来自荆门南桥、天门、沔阳、潜江、石首等县的木工也在那里锯木料。各县木工一比，王祥珍用的那把只剩下两分宽的锯条锋利无比，拉得哗哗响，锯得快，有锯路，工效高，人轻松，锯的木料又平整。荆州各县的木工看了，个个叫好，纷纷要求王祥珍打个介绍信，找万忠清师傅订货。（附图片）
