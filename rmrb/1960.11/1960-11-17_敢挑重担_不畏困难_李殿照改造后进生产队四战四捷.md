    Daring to Take on Heavy Responsibilities, Not Afraid of Difficulties
    ——Li Dianzhao Transforms Backward Production Teams, Winning Four Battles and Four Victories
    Shanxi Daily Reporter Ren Zhihao

    In the late autumn season, I came to the Wang Yazhuang Management Area of the Jiacun People's Commune in Wanrong County to visit Li Dianzhao, the leader of the Third Production Team and head of the Party Group.

    Li Dianzhao is the kind of person who dares to take on heavy burdens, is not afraid of great difficulties, thinks before acting, and plans his steps carefully. He always "creates brand names" in his work, always taking the lead. Over the years, he has served as the leader of four backward production teams, and in each team, production increased that year, the income of the members increased, and he quickly turned the backward team into an advanced team. The members praised him as a "victorious cadre" and a "brand-creating leader." Last year, in the Wanrong County grand evaluation, the County People's Committee awarded him the title of "Heroic Figure."

    A Thousand Goods, Ten Thousand Goods, "Doing" is the Best
    In the winter of 1954, as soon as the primary cooperative was established, Li Dianzhao became the production team leader. When the cooperative allocated land, farm tools, and other means of production, two well-off middle peasant team leaders took the lead in being picky: they wanted the strong livestock and the fertile land. The team leaders wouldn't give in, and they argued for two or three nights without resolving the issue. Li Dianzhao couldn't stand it anymore, so he said, "You pick all the good stuff, I'll take what's left!" In this way, Li Dianzhao's team started with a backward foundation.

    Back in the team, the members complained: one said he was a "gourd," another said he was "easily manipulated." Li Dianzhao didn't mind at all. He said, "Yellow earth doesn't deceive farmers; there's no such thing as bad crops on bad land. As long as we work hard, we'll produce more grain; it's only real skill if bad land surpasses good land!"

    Originally, the characteristic of the hillside land was that it was mostly bordered by the embankment root on one side and the embankment edge on the other. The embankment root sloped, taking up land, and the embankment edge was overgrown with weeds. In this way, the embankment root and embankment edge "squeezed" the land, and only eight-tenths of a mu could be planted per mu. In addition, the land sloped uphill, making it difficult to transport manure, and some land was not well cultivated, which naturally couldn't produce much grain. But what if we turned it around? Li Dianzhao's idea at the time was to use the collective strength of the agricultural cooperative and adopt the method of "cutting the embankment root and digging weeds on the embankment edge" to both expand the cultivated area and use the old soil and rotten grass as fertilizer, which would definitely produce more grain.

    As soon as he said this, the members' enthusiasm was high, and they all said, "A thousand goods, ten thousand goods, 'doing' is the best, let's do it!" Their entire team consisted of twelve households, seven of which were poor peasants and two were lower-middle peasants. They were all experienced farmers, and when they said they would do it, they did it with great effort. By the spring of 1955, they had changed the appearance of three hundred mu of land: the edge of the land was no longer covered with grass, and high ridges were built; the slope at the embankment root was gone, and thick old soil was cut off; the cultivated area was expanded by sixteen mu, and a large amount of fertilizer was fermented with rotten grass. That year, the fields were carefully managed, without any gaps, and all work was done ahead of schedule. As a result, the bad land yielded a good harvest, winning the production championship in the entire cooperative. The average yield of wheat per mu was eight jin more than other teams, the average yield of cotton per mu was three jin more, and the autumn crops also averaged six jin more. According to the contracted production targets, they exceeded the target by more than 20%, turning the backward team into an advanced team.

    Advanced Takes Command, the Able Become Teachers
    In January 1956, a high tide of advanced cooperativization, everyone joined the cooperative. Cooperative director Zhang Jinxue again asked Li Dianzhao to serve as the leader of the Fourth Team. He said, "The Fourth Team has bad land, few old cooperative members, and many difficulties in the work. We think it would be best for you to be the team leader." Li Dianzhao readily agreed: "I'll go where there are difficulties. How can a Party member be afraid of difficulties?"

    However, changing the backward appearance of the Fourth Team was not easy. Poor natural conditions were one problem, and the manpower was also too poor: some well-off middle peasant members were slow to work but quick to calculate, only wanting to take advantage; there were two old members with backward thinking who did not work hard. Li Dianzhao thought about it over and over again and felt that the problem was very big. At this time, it was the dead of winter, there was little work in the fields, and the members were all staying at home. Li Dianzhao visited all the members of the team door-to-door. He found that some new members were very active and determined to move forward in production. He thought: we should unite this group of activists to transform the backward appearance of the Fourth Team. He immediately decided: "The clumsy bird flies first, let's start early."

    But with the snow blocking the mountain gate, where should we start? Just as Li Dianzhao was undecided, Old Man Changsheng came to his door. He was an old member of the production team where Li Dianzhao had originally been, and he wasn't very active at first. Once, he came up with an idea in production, which Li Dianzhao adopted and encouraged him. He was so happy that he proposed two or three more suggestions in a row, became an activist, and had a good relationship with Li Dianzhao. These days, seeing that Li Dianzhao was encountering difficulties in his work and was busy going in and out of homes, he wanted to help him come up with an idea. As soon as Li Dianzhao saw him, he said, "The team is organized, but where should we start the battle?" Old Man Li Changsheng said directly, "It's easy to handle. There's a ditch on the east side. Cut down the soil from the small mountains on both sides to block the mouth, and when the flood silts up, it won't that turn into a 'granary'!" Li Dianzhao also had such a plan. The two of them hit it off, and all four hands drummed on the same drum. Li Dianzhao was happy and thought of the process of Li Changsheng becoming an activist, which further reminded him that the Party educates Party members to trust the masses and discuss things with the masses. Facts prove that once you trust and discuss, the enthusiasm of the masses will be mobilized. With the support of the masses, what difficulties are there to fear? After clarifying this principle, he always pondered how to mobilize the masses.

    Trusting the masses and relying on the masses - this method really worked. At the team meeting, when discussing the production plan to start early, Zhang Xueren proposed the suggestion of repairing the East Ditch land, and Li Dianzhao asked him to lead the work and become the group leader. Seeing that the leadership trusted him, Zhang Xueren became even more motivated. Before dawn, he called people to the fields, and when he arrived, he organized everyone to carry out a competition. Because the ground was frozen and difficult to dig, Zhang Youwa created the "root-searching soil-collecting method," which improved labor efficiency. Li Dianzhao asked him to be a technical teacher to impart his experience. With this, Zhang Youwa's enthusiasm became even greater, and he continued to use his brain to come up with the method of "watching the soil line to wedge and reveal the frozen soil." When people's enthusiasm was brought into play, the work that was originally planned to take one hundred and twenty workdays to complete was completed successfully in only eighty workdays. These thirteen mu of land can produce an average of five or six hundred catties of grain per mu every year, which is really like a "granary" that has been built.

    In this year, Li Dianzhao used this leadership method of "advanced takes command, the able become teachers" to mobilize the enthusiasm of every member and overcome the negative tendencies of individual members' passive work. Therefore, the team's work was done quickly and well, and they won the grain and cotton production championship in the entire cooperative. At the production summary meeting, the Party branch secretary said that the Fourth Team could be considered a production team with "new people and a rich year." However, at this time, Li Dianzhao was no longer the leader of this team. He accepted the Party's assignment and became the leader of another backward production team.

    Find the Root Cause, Reverse Backwardness
    The matter was as follows:

    In the summer of 1956, the wheat here grew particularly well. But the weather was bad, and it rained for forty days in a row during the wheat harvest season. Because the Third Production Team had not planned carefully in advance, they failed to rush the harvest, resulting in most of the wheat being soaked in the rain and sprouting. Summer passed and autumn came, and it was time to plant the wheat for the next year, but they had not repaired the wheat fields, and the manure had not been delivered; the autumn crops had to be harvested, the cotton had to be picked, and all kinds of agricultural work piled up like a tower. The cooperative cadres felt that something was wrong and said to Li Dianzhao, "We're sorry to trouble you to go to a backward team again to rectify the Third Team." Li Dianzhao went without saying a word. He inspected the fields and felt that the Third Team had a really big hole in its production; although this "disease" had been contracted slowly, it had to be treated quickly and not miss the wheat sowing season.

    The more he thought about it, the more he felt the heavy responsibility. That night, he convened a meeting of the members and said to everyone, "Whoever is sick has to sweat, and we have to do the agricultural work that we've piled up. This year, the wheat sprouted, and it's sticky to eat. Everyone has suffered. If we don't work hard now and can't plant wheat, we won't even have bad wheat next year. Time is pressing, what do you think we should do!" Women's team leader Gao Lianlian said first, "Whether it's busy in the summer or busy in the autumn, the embroideresses get out of bed. We women will never fall behind the men." When the young lads heard this, they were really unconvinced and said, "Is Mu Guiying so powerful! Can the Seven Langs and Eight Tigers not fight on the battlefield? Come on! Let's slap hands and compete." Seeing that everyone was getting enthusiastic, Li Dianzhao said loudly, "Immediately rectify the team and start working immediately." The tense blitz began like this. Eating at home wasted time, so they lit a fire in the field, and people and livestock went to the field together. Under Li Dianzhao's constant encouragement, the members were full of energy, and labor efficiency increased day by day. By the time the sun set on the eleventh day, shouts of victory were heard from the crowd, and the preparation of the six hundred mu of wheat fields and the delivery of manure were all completed. They rested on the twelfth day, and the thirteenth day was exactly the "Autumn Equinox" season, which was neither too early nor too late for planting wheat.

    Li Dianzhao is never satisfied with existing achievements in his work. On the contrary, he always "gains an inch and wants a foot," "having gained Long, he looks to Shu." After achieving one victory, he welcomes another greater victory. At this time, in order to plant wheat well and win a bumper harvest in the coming year, he was really thinking while walking, dreaming while sleeping, and asking the old farmers when he met them. After discussing with the masses, in addition to planting wheat well, he planted black beans on the field embankments to suit the habit of black beans liking raw soil. From this item alone, 2,700 catties were harvested in 1957 and 6,000 catties in 1958. Under the leadership of Li Dianzhao, the Third Team achieved bumper harvests year after year and won championships year after year.

    Skillfully Make Tools, Improve Work Efficiency
    In the late autumn and early winter of 1958, Li Dianzhao served as the leader of the backward production team for the fourth time. At that time, it was the early stage of the people's commune, but the Third Production Team Leader Zhang Guibao's work style was not down-to-earth. He said a lot but did little. After the commune Party committee discovered these problems, it suggested that the management committee dismiss Zhang Guibao and send Li Dianzhao to take over as the leader. Considering Li Dianzhao's difficulties, the management area Party branch secretary Zhang Yingrong said, "You go first, and then we will transfer livestock to support you!" Li Dianzhao said, "No need, all the teams are short of livestock, let's find a way to solve it!"

    Li Dianzhao was worried about the livestock and rushed to the feeding room. At this time, night had already fallen, and the cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules were all tied to the troughs, looking thin and lacking energy. He grabbed a handful of grass and saw that it was more than three inches long. Now he understood that the livestock was weak because of poor feeding. He then appointed Shi Linsheng, who was active and responsible and had experience in feeding livestock, as the feeding team leader. Shi Linsheng, with his fiery personality, heard that he was asked to feed the livestock and immediately came to the feeding room with his bedding. They studied the method of "feeding in separate troughs" and determined the policy of "focusing on gaining weight first and then on breeding." Then they turned to agricultural production.

    Shi Linsheng first raised a question, he said, "The autumn fields are easy to handle, if it doesn't work this year, we'll look at next year. The difficulty is the wheat fields. The seeds have already entered the soil, so we can't deep plow, and we can't add base fertilizer. What should we do?" For Li Dianzhao, this was indeed a new problem. He had transformed three backward teams in the past, but he had taken over empty land, and he could use his strength. Now, with the seedlings in the ground, there was no way to use force. Moreover, in southern Shanxi, if you don't grasp the wheat fields, you'll lose 70 to 80 percent of the harvest. How can you change the backward appearance of the Third Team? He was worried for a while and forgot to eat dinner and forgot to sleep. It wasn't until the rooster crowed and the east turned white that he came up with the method of universally irrigating the wheat seedlings with liquid fertilizer. But as soon as he said it, Shi Linsheng shook his head and said, "Liquid fertilizer has to be carried to the ground one load at a time, and then poured in one scoop at a time. You calculate how many workdays nine hundred mu of wheat would take!" Li Dianzhao estimated that it would be difficult, so he thought about it again and again and finally came up with a way to innovate tools.

    From that day on, Li Dianzhao stayed in the feeding room every night, helping Shi Linsheng feed the livestock; Shi Linsheng accompanied Li Dianzhao, making new tools. Soon they jointly manufactured a new tool. This tool looks very simple, but it is very convenient to use. It has a pole and two buckets. The liquid fertilizer is placed in the buckets, and two people lift it up one in front of the other. When the switch is turned on, the fertilizer flows down the wheat ridges. One person can do the work of at least two people, and it is also very even. The members love to use it. However, it is easy to splatter and dirty clothes, and it has not overcome the difficulty of slow manual carrying. Li Dianzhao and Shi Linsheng used their brains again and created a straw irrigation vehicle that was similar to a water sprinkler in the city. It can topdress and spread evenly, increasing work efficiency by eleven times compared to manual carrying and pouring. The members were energetic when using it, and the nine hundred mu of wheat fields were universally irrigated twice in a row, which not only made up for the shortcomings of poor sowing but also strengthened field management. Therefore, in 1959, the Third Team led by Li Dianzhao harvested an average of one hundred and ninety-two catties of wheat per mu, which was a new record for large-scale high-yield production in the dryland highlands of Wanrong County.

    When I met Li Dianzhao, he and the members were working shirtless. He rarely spoke, but only asked people to point out his shortcomings. I thought: An excellent person who is also so modest will definitely move forward forever!

    敢挑重担　不畏困难
    ——李殿照改造后进生产队四战四捷
    山西日报记者　任志浩
    深秋的季节，我来到万荣县贾村人民公社王亚庄管理区，访问了第三生产队队长、党小组长李殿照。
    李殿照这个人，重担子敢挑，大困难不怕，遇事想，走路谋，样样工作“创牌子”，样样工作走在先。几年来，他当过四个后进生产队的队长，每到一队都是当年产量提高，社员收入增加，把后进队很快变成先进队。社员们夸他为“常胜干部”、“创牌队长”。去年万荣县大评比，县人民委员会授予他“英雄豪杰”的称号。
    千好万好　干字最好
    1954年冬天，初级社一成立，李殿照就担任了生产队长。在社里分拨土地、农具等生产资料的时候，有两个富裕中农队长带头挑肥拣瘦：牲口挑壮的，土地要肥的。队长们不让，争吵了两三个夜晚，也分拨不开。李殿照看不顺眼，就说：“好东西尽你们挑，丢下赖的我来拾底！”这样，李殿照这个队一开头就坐了个落后的家底子。
    回到队里，社员们埋怨：这个说他是“葫芦”，那个说他是“任人作弄”。李殿照全不计较，他说：“黄土不昧庄稼人，有烂地没有烂庄稼。只要拧着胳膊干，不少打粮食，烂地超过好地才算本事哩！” 
    原来山坡土地的特点，大都是一头靠堰根，一头临堰边。堰根溜坡占地，堰边又杂草丛生，这样堰根、堰边“两头挤”，一亩只能种八分。再加上土地爬坡，送粪艰难，有些地种得很不好，这当然不能多打粮食。可是如果把它翻个个呢？李殿照当时的主意，就是想利用农业社的集体力量，采用“堰根切边，堰边刨草”的办法，既扩大耕地面积，同时利用陈土烂草作肥料，一定能够多打粮食。
    他这样一说，社员们积极性高了，都说：“千好万好，干字最好，咱们干吧！”他们全队共十二户人家，有七户贫农，两户下中农，种地都是老手，说声干就大干起来了。到1955年春天，他们就把三百亩土地改变了模样：地边没了草，培起高高的地埂；堰根下去了溜坡，切下厚厚的陈土；扩大耕地十六亩，又用烂草沤了大量肥料。这一年，田禾管理得精细，辙辙不漏，样样工作都赶在前头。结果赖地收了好庄稼，在全社夺得了丰产冠军。小麦每亩平均产量比其他队多收八斤，棉花每亩平均多收三斤，秋作物也平均多收六斤。按包产指标来计算，超产了20％还多，把落后队变成了先进队。
    先进挂帅　能者为师
    1956年1月，高级合作化高潮，全民入社。社主任张进学，又叫李殿照到第四队担任队长。他说：“四队土地坏，老社员少，工作中有不少困难，我们觉得你去当队长最好。”李殿照一口答应：“有困难我就去，党员嘛！怎能怕困难。”
    可是要改变四队的落后面貌，也并不容易，自然条件不好是一个问题，而且人手又太差：有的富裕中农社员是干活靠后，算账靠前，光想沾便宜；有两户老社员，思想过于落后，不好好劳动。李殿照前后想了想，也觉得问题很大。这时，正值十冬腊月，地里活少，社员们都呆在家里，李殿照挨门逐户，访问了全队的社员。他发现有些新社员非常积极，决心要在生产上赶前一步。他想：应当团结这批积极分子，来改造四队的落后面貌。当即决定：“笨鸟先飞，及早动手。”
    但是雪闭山门，先从哪里下手呢？李殿照正拿不定主意的时候，长盛老汉找上门来了。他是原先李殿照在的那个生产队的老社员，起先也不算积极。有一回，他在生产上出了个主意，李殿照采纳了，并鼓励了他。他一高兴，就一连提出两三个建议来，变成了积极分子，同李殿照的关系很好。这几天，他见李殿照工作上遇到困难，东家进西家出的忙个不停，便想来帮他拿个主意。李殿照一见他来，就说：“队伍组织好了，可是兴兵打仗，先从哪里开刀？”李长盛老汉直截了当地说：“这好办，东门上有条沟，把两边小山上的土斩下来堵上口，洪水一淤，还不顶个‘粮囤’！”李殿照也有这样的打算，两人不谋而合，四只手打在一面鼓上。李殿照心里高兴，就想起了李长盛成为积极分子的过程，从而进一步又想到：党教育党员要相信群众，有事同群众商量，事实证明，一相信，一商量，群众的积极性就调动起来了，有了群众的支持，还怕什么困难。弄清了这个道理以后，他就处处思谋着如何发动群众。
    相信群众、依靠群众——这办法真灵。在队员会上，讨论及早动手的生产计划时，张学仁提出修东沟地的建议，李殿照就叫他领工、当组长。张学仁见领导上信任他，积极性更大了，天不明，就喊人上地，到地里，就组织大家开展竞赛。由于地冻难刨，张有娃制造了“搜根取土法”，提高了劳动效率，李殿照就叫他当技术老师，传授经验。这一下，张有娃的心劲更大了，继续开动脑筋，想出了“看土线下楔揭冻土”的方法。人的积极性发挥了，原计划得一百二十个工才能干完的活，只用了八十个工就胜利完成。这十三亩土地，每年每亩平均能打五、六百斤粮食，真是扎了一个“粮囤”。
    在这一年中，李殿照就运用这种“先进挂帅，能者为师”的领导方法，调动了每个社员的积极性，克服了个别社员消极怠工等不良倾向。因此，全队的活计做得又快又好，在全社夺得了粮、棉生产冠军。党支部书记在生产总结大会上，说第四队这一年可算是“人新年丰”的生产队。不过这时，李殿照已不是这个队的队长了，他接受党的分配，又担任了另一个后进生产队的队长。
    找到病根　扭转落后
    事情是这样的：
    1956年的夏天，这里的小麦长得特别好。可是天不作美，正值麦收季节，一连下了四十天雨。第三生产队因为事先计划不周，未能抢收回来，结果把大部小麦淋在雨里出了芽。夏去秋来，下一年的小麦该要种了，但他们麦地没整修，粪还没送；秋禾要收，棉花要摘，各种农活积得成堆似塔。社干部觉得不妙，就对李殿照说：“难为你，再下一回落后队，去整顿整顿第三队。”李殿照二话没说，就去了。他漫地里查验了一回，觉得第三队在生产上场的窟窿实在大；这场“病”虽是慢慢染成的，可是还得慢病快治，不能错过小麦播种的节令。
    他越想越觉得责任重大，当天黑夜就召开社员会，对大家说：“谁得病谁出汗，咱们堆下的农活还得咱们干。今年小麦出芽，吃起来沾牙，大家受屈。现下不好好劳动，种不上小麦，明年连坏麦子也没有。节令逼人，大家说怎么办吧！”妇女队长高莲莲首先说：“夏忙秋忙，绣女下床。我们妇女总不落男人的后。”年轻小伙子们一听，真不服气，说：“穆桂英这样厉害！难道七郎八虎能不战斗疆场，来！击掌竞赛。”李殿照看见大家的热劲来了，高声说：“马上整顿队伍，立即动手。”紧张的突击战，就这样开始了。家里吃饭悞工夫，他们就在地头起火，人和牲口一齐下地。在李殿照的不断鼓励下，社员们一个个浑身是劲，劳动效率日日增高。到第十一天太阳落山时，人群里就发出了胜利的欢笑，六百亩麦田的整地和送粪工作都一齐完成了。第十二日歇了一天，第十三日就正是种麦不迟不早的“秋分”节令。
    李殿照在工作上，从不满足已有的成绩，相反的总是“得寸进尺”、“得陇望蜀”，取得一个胜利，就迎接另一个更大的胜利。这时，他为种好小麦、夺取来年的丰收，真是走路在想，睡觉在梦，碰到老农就问。经过他和群众商量，除种好小麦外，适应黑豆喜欢生土的习性，在地堰上点种了黑豆。光这项，1957年收了两千七百斤，1958年收了六千斤。在李殿照的领导下，第三队在这两年，连年获得丰收，连年获得冠军。
    巧制工具　提高工效
    1958年秋末冬初，李殿照又第四次担任了后进生产队的队长。当时，正值人民公社化的初期，但第三生产队长张贵保作风不踏实，说得多，做得少。公社党委发现这些问题后，建议管委会撤销了张贵保的职务，派李殿照去接任了队长。管理区党支部书记张应荣考虑到李殿照的困难，就说：“你先去，随后就调牲口支援你！”李殿照说：“不用了，各队牲口都紧，我们想办法解决吧！”
    李殿照心上记挂着牲口，急忙跑到饲养室来。这时，夜幕已经降临了，牛马驴骡都拴在槽上，看见又瘦又没精神。他顺手抓起一把草，见足有三寸多长。这下明白了，牲口瘦弱是因为饲养不善，就派工作积极负责、喂养牲口有经验的史林生当了饲养组组长。史林生火暴的性格，听说叫他喂牲口，马上带着铺盖来到饲养室。他们研究了“分槽喂养”的方法，确定了“先抓膘后抓繁殖”的方针，然后就扯到农田生产上来。
    史林生先提出一个问题，他说：“秋田好办，今年不行看明年。困难的是麦田，种籽已经入土了，想深翻不能，加底肥也不能，到底该怎办呢？”这对李殿照来说，的确是个新问题。他过去改造了三个后进队，但接手的都是空地，有劲能使出来；现在青苗在地，想使力也没有法子。而且，在晋南来说，抓不住麦田就把七、八成的收成丢了，怎能改变三队的后进面貌呢？他一时发愁，忘了吃晚饭，也忘了睡觉。直到鸡啼报晓，东方发白，才想出了用液体肥料普灌麦苗的方法。可是他一说，史林生就摇着头说：“液体肥料上地，得一担一担担，又得一杓一杓往里灌，你算算九百亩麦子得多少工啊！”李殿照一估算，也觉得有困难，想来想去，终于想出了革新工具的办法来。
    从这天起，晚晚不空，李殿照住在饲养室，帮助史林生喂牲口；史林生陪着李殿照，制造新工具。不久他们合伙制造成了一种新工具。这种工具看来很简单，用起来却很方便，一根杆子两个桶，液体肥料放在桶内，两人一前一后的抬起，开关一打，肥料就顺着麦垅流了下去。一个人至少可干两个人的活，还追得很匀，社员们很爱用。但是，它容易溅脏衣服，又没有克服人力担运慢的困难。李殿照和史林生又动脑子，创造了大致同城市里的洒水车相像的茅灌车，能追肥，能洒匀，比人担手泼提高工效十一倍。社员们用着得劲，情绪高，九百亩麦田连着普灌了两遍，既弥补了下种不好的缺欠，又加强了田间管理。因此，在1959年李殿照领导的第三队，平均每亩小麦收了一百九十二斤，是万荣县高塬旱地大面积丰产的新纪录。
    当我见到李殿照的时候，他正和社员们光着膀子干活。他很少说话，只是叫人们给他提缺点。我想：一个优秀人物，又这样谦虚，一定会永远前进！
