    Meeting the Needs of the Masses and Promoting Social Material Conservation:
    Tianjin Increases the Number of Repair Service Stations
    Mobile Services Provided Door-to-Door, Striving to Shorten Turnaround Times, Sixty-Nine New Repair Services Added, Prices Reduced for Over Six Hundred Services
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 23rd) Tianjin's repair service, tailoring, laundry, and dyeing industry workers are carrying out a "five comparisons" competition campaign centered on improving service quality, and the service outlook has changed significantly.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, especially since the establishment of urban people's communes, the number of people participating in production and the volume of commodity sales have increased significantly, which has increased the task of repair services. In order to make repair service work better adapt to the new situation, Tianjin's financial and trade leadership departments first focused on the political and ideological work of the repair personnel, further strengthening the sense of responsibility of the repair personnel to serve the people wholeheartedly, and further recognizing the important position of the repair service industry in people's lives. All employees enthusiastically launched a "five comparisons" competition comparing quality, turnaround speed, service attitude, conservation and substitution of raw materials, and implementation of price policies. Through the competition, the repair industry added sixty-nine new projects such as new uppers on old shoe soles, oiling wooden basins, and repairing zippers and small wallets, as well as more than two thousand new measures to facilitate the masses. More than two hundred single-service stations and points have been transformed into multi-service, all-round, or comprehensive repair service stations, ensuring that no job is refused and everything is repaired. Many outlets in the laundry and dyeing industry have developed from simple laundry and dyeing to laundry, mending, dismantling and washing, and full-service tailoring. All sewing shops and most clothing stores also undertake dismantling and refurbishment work. This has greatly facilitated the masses and promoted social conservation. In the "five comparisons" competition, repair and service personnel also broke the passive situation of "sitting in the store and waiting for customers" in the past, and mobile service teams and cart teams went from street to street, handling collection and delivery. Many mobile service teams also combined repair and purchasing businesses, adopting the method of repairing if possible and purchasing if not.
    In order to make it easier for the masses to find places to repair things nearby, in addition to expanding the original service stations and service points, Tianjin's repair service industry has also newly established seven hundred and forty-seven service stations and more than forty comprehensive "repair service streets" in areas where residents are concentrated and on bustling streets. Service industry workers have also adopted staggered work shifts to extend business hours and carry out activities to develop multiple skills in one person, striving to shorten turnaround times. Basically, large jobs are shortened from about ten days in the past to two or three days, small jobs are completed on the same day, and special emergencies are repaired immediately, which is welcomed by the masses.
    Tianjin's repair service industry attaches importance to implementing the principle of "service first, convenience to the masses, and promotion of social conservation," and has reasonably adjusted repair prices. Among the one thousand and sixty service items in fourteen repair industries such as leather shoes, casual shoes, bicycles, sewing utensils, etc., six hundred and ten items have had their prices reduced by an average of 12.58%.
    In order to better serve residents, Tianjin's service industry has also made efforts to improve service quality and improve service methods in many ways. The service industry near the Dongxing Market recently joined forces with local department stores, non-staple food stores, and other industries to form a winter heating service team. Starting from investigation and research, they went deep into residents' homes, visiting door-to-door to help residents install and repair chimneys and stoves. They also adopted the method of "teaching one household and spreading it to the whole courtyard," so that the heating stoves of more than 2,500 households in the vicinity were transformed into new stove types that save coal and burn well. They found that some households needed to replace glass or wallpaper for doors and windows, and some households had not yet dismantled and washed their cotton clothes, so they took the initiative to help solve these problems.
    In addition, the employees of the vast commercial retail departments in Tianjin have also warmly responded to the call to vigorously develop repair services, and many outlets have launched the business of "selling what you repair." More than forty salespersons at the New China Stationery Store in Tianjin Quanye Field both sell goods and repair them, and everyone can repair several kinds of stationery.

    满足群众生活需要　促进社会物资节约
    天津增设大批修理服务站
    走街串巷主动服务上门  千方百计缩短交活时间  修配业务新添六十九种  六百多项服务价格降低
    本报天津23日电　天津市修理服务、缝纫洗染行业职工，开展以提高服务质量为中心的“五比”竞赛运动，服务面貌显著改变。
    大跃进以来，特别是城市人民公社建立以来，参加生产的人数和商品销售量增加很多，这就加大了修理服务的任务。天津市财贸领导部门为了使修理服务工作更好地适应新形势，首先抓紧了修配人员中的政治思想工作，使修理人员进一步加强了全心全意为人民服务的责任感，进一步认识到修理服务行业在人民生活中的重要地位，全体职工热烈地掀起了比质量、比交活速度、比服务态度、比节约代用原材料、比执行价格政策的“五比”竞赛。通过竞赛，修配行业增加了旧鞋底上新帮、木盆上油、修理拉链小皮夹等六十九个新项目和二千多项便利群众的新措施。二百多个单项服务的站和点变成了多项、全能或综合性的修配服务站，作到了来活不拒，无所不修。洗染行业的许多门市部已经由单纯洗染发展为洗染、缝补、拆洗、承作，一包到底。所有的缝纫店和大部分服装店都兼作拆旧翻新工作。这都大大便利了群众，推动了社会节约。在“五比”竞赛中，修配服务人员还打破了过去“坐地开店、等客上门”的被动局面，流动服务队和小车队串街走巷，管收管送。许多流动服务队还把修配和收购业务结合起来，采取能修就修、不能修就收购的办法。
    为了使群众可以就近找到地方修理东西，天津市修理服务行业除了扩大原有的服务站和服务点之外，还在居民居住集中的区域和繁华的街道上，新设立了七百四十七个服务站和四十多个综合性的“修配服务一条街”，服务性行业的工作人员还采取了交叉上班以延长营业时间和开展一人多艺的活动，千方百计地缩短交活时间，基本上做到了大活由过去的十天左右缩短到二、三天交活，小活当天交活，特殊紧急的随到随修，受到群众欢迎。
    天津市修理服务行业重视贯彻“服务为主、便利群众、促进社会节约”的原则，合理调整了修配价格，在皮鞋、便鞋、自行车、缝纫炊具等十四个修配行业的一千零六十项服务项目中，已有六百一十项平均降低价格12.58％。
    为了更好地为居民服务，天津市的服务行业还多方面地想方寻法提高服务质量，改进服务方法。东兴市场附近的服务行业，最近同当地百货、副食等行业的商店联合组成了冬季保暖服务组，从调查研究入手，深入到居民家里，挨门挨户地进行访问，帮助居民安装修理烟筒、炉子。他们还采取“教会一户，传授全院”的办法，让附近二千五百多户居民的取暖炉子都改成了既省煤又好烧的新炉型。他们发现有些户的门窗需要更换玻璃或裱糊，有些户的棉衣还没有拆洗，就主动上门帮助解决。
    此外，天津市广大商业零售部门的职工，也热烈响应了大搞修配服务的号召，许多门市部开展了“卖什么、修什么”的业务。天津劝业场新中国文具店的四十多个售货员，既售货，又修配，人人都能修理好几种文具用品。
