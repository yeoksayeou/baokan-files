Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: Since September, the iron smelting workers in Jinan City, Shandong Province, have been carrying out a campaign to learn from and catch up with the Red Flag Blast Furnace of the smelting workshop of Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory. The production level of thirty-three blast furnaces in the city has been significantly improved, and eighteen of them have initially reached the standard of "Red Flag Furnace."

All iron smelting units first studied the experience of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory's smelting workshop in political and ideological work. They further mobilized the workers to make political, economic, potential, and time calculations, thereby enhancing the political consciousness of the workers and boosting their enthusiasm. Leading cadres of all iron smelting units compared their thinking, style, political work, and management work with those of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory's leading cadres. Workers compared their enthusiasm, work attitude, and sense of responsibility with those of the Jinan Printing and Dyeing Factory's workers. Units such as the First Smelting Workshop of Jinan Weaving Factory learned from the experience of the printing and dyeing factory and created a new situation in which the whole Party engaged in ideological work, vigorously promoting advanced thinking and rapidly overcoming backward thinking, effectively boosting the increase in pig iron production.

All iron smelting units enthusiastically carried out mass-based competition activities, promoting the Red Flag Furnace movement to deepen step by step. City-wide iron smelting front has peer-to-peer competitions, opponent-to-opponent competitions, "one-dragon" collaboration competitions between upstream and downstream processes, and individual pacesetter competitions, with everyone chasing each other in full swing. In the inter-district competition between Tianqiao District and Lixia District, they exchanged information with each other every day. Since September, Tianqiao District had been surpassed by Lixia District three times. Tianqiao District promptly summarized its experience and lessons, with the secretary taking the lead and cadres taking responsibility for the furnaces, vigorously engaging in mass movements and creating a new record for the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in the entire district, finally surpassing Lixia District. The Red Flag Furnace of the Printing and Dyeing Factory and the small blast furnace of the First Smelting Workshop of Jinan Weaving Factory, their old competitor, have always been competing and helping each other. From the furnace workers to the raw material workers, the First Smelting Workshop of the Weaving Factory often went to the Printing and Dyeing Factory for advice after work. The two blast furnaces chased each other and maintained excellent results in high yield, high quality, and low consumption for a long time, and both have completed their annual iron production plans ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th: The Red Flag Group of Tianjin Steel Front – the Yang Desheng Converter Steelmaking Group of Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant – continued to forge ahead after achieving continuous "thousand furnaces without rejects." As of November 9, they had continuously produced another 280 furnaces of steel, all of which were qualified.

Now, the advanced thinking and advanced experience of the Yang Desheng Group have been spread to all steel plants in Tianjin, and a competition to learn from and catch up with the Yang Desheng Group has been launched among the workers of each steel plant.

The Yang Desheng Group has further formulated a continuous leap forward plan to achieve "no rejects throughout the year" and the second "thousand furnaces without rejects," and regards humbly learning the advanced experience of fraternal groups as the main measure to achieve the plan. After learning about the experience of the Wang Yiyuan Group of Tangshan Steel Plant in consuming a large amount of scrap steel and reducing the consumption of pig iron, they immediately creatively applied it in combination with the specific characteristics of their group, so that the pig iron consumption per ton of steel quickly dropped by more than 20 kilograms. They also went to Tianjin No. 2 Steel Plant twice to learn from the advanced experience of the Sun Jinqi Group in "single slag operation" and shortening smelting time, shortening the blowing time of each furnace of steel by more than ten minutes.

    把先进水平变成普遍水平
    济南炼铁单位学赶红旗炉生产水平显著提高
    天津展开学赶杨德生炼钢红旗小组竞赛
    据新华社济南电　山东省济南市炼铁职工开展学赶济南印染厂冶炼车间红旗高炉的运动。9月份以来，全市有三十三座高炉的生产水平已显著提高，其中有十八座高炉初步达到了“红旗炉”的标准。
    各炼铁单位都首先学习济南印染厂冶炼车间政治思想工作经验，进一步通过讲形势，摆任务，发动职工大算政治、经济、潜力、时间四笔账，使广大职工提高了政治觉悟，鼓起了更大的干劲。各炼铁单位的领导干部都同印染厂的领导干部比思想，比作风，比政治工作，比管理工作；职工群众同印染厂的职工比干劲，比劳动态度，比工作责任心。济南织布厂第一冶炼车间等单位学习印染厂的经验，出现了全党做思想工作的新局面，使先进思想不断发扬，落后思想迅速克服，有力地促进了生铁产量的增长。
    各炼铁单位热烈开展了群众性的竞赛活动，推动红旗炉运动步步深入。全市炼铁战线的对口赛、对手赛，上下工序之间的“一条龙”协作赛和个人标兵赛，你追我赶，热火朝天。天桥区和历下区在区际竞赛中，每天互通情报，9月以来天桥区曾先后三次被历下区超过。天桥区及时总结经验教训，书记上阵，干部包炉，大搞群众运动，创造了全区高炉平均利用系数的新纪录，终于超过了历下区。印染厂红旗炉和他们的老竞赛对手济南织布厂第一冶炼车间的小高炉，一直是又赛又帮。织布厂第一冶炼车间从炉前工到原料工，经常下了班就跑到印染厂去请教。两座高炉你追我赶，长时间来共同保持了高产、优质、低耗的优异成绩，并且都已提前完成了全年的产铁计划。
    据新华社天津12日电　天津市钢铁战线红旗小组——天津第二钢厂杨德生转炉炼钢小组，在实现连续
  “千炉无废品”以后，继续奋勇前进。截至11月9日，又连续炼出了二百八十炉钢，炉炉合格。
    现在，杨德生小组的先进思想和先进经验已经传播到天津全市各炼钢厂，并且在各钢厂职工中展开了学、赶杨德生小组的竞赛活动。
    杨德生小组现在进一步订出了实现“全年无废品”和第二个“千炉无废品的”继续跃进计划，并且把虚心学习兄弟小组的先进经验作为实现计划的主要措施。他们在知道了唐山钢厂王益元小组创造的大吃废钢、降低生铁消耗的经验以后，就马上结合本组的具体特点创造性地加以运用，使每吨钢的生铁消耗很快降低了二十多公斤。他们还两次到天津第二钢厂学习孙金琦小组的“单渣操作”、缩短熔炼时间的先进经验，使每炉钢的吹炼时间缩短了十多分钟。（附图片）
