　　Determined to Take Root in the Countryside with Redness and Expertise
　　Hu Wenlan, Head of the Youth Pig Farm of Luli Brigade, Hancun Commune, Qingfeng, Henan

　　What are the lofty ideals of young people? How can one avoid wasting one's youth? Under the cultivation and education of the Party, I have correctly understood this question over the past three years.

　　In the summer of 1957, I graduated from the First Middle School of Hua County, Henan. When I happily reported the good news to my mother with my graduation certificate, she said with tears of excitement, "Wenlan, don't forget that this is thanks to Chairman Mao!" I said, "Don't worry, I will listen to the Party and am determined to join production in the Fifteenth Production Team of the Minta Second Advanced Cooperative. I will definitely make a name for myself there."

　　Some people asked me, "Your family lives in the city, and your brother and your spouse work in the city. Why do you insist on going to the countryside to participate in labor?"

　　My ancestors lived in the countryside and suffered from hunger and starvation for many years. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao rescued our entire family from misery. This deeply engraved a class imprint on my young heart, making me love labor and love the countryside.

　　After I arrived at the Fifteenth Production Team of the Minta Second Advanced Cooperative, the Party branch welcomed me very much and asked me to serve as the captain of the Youth Shock Team. At that time, I was both happy and worried. As a recent graduate who hadn't yet achieved anything, the leadership valued me so much. I was determined to work hard. At that time, we were fighting drought, and our thirty-six young people were taking on the difficulties, digging wells to draw water to the highlands. On the first day of labor, I didn't feel too tired, but on the second day, my back and legs started to ache a little. By the third and fourth days, five blisters had formed on both of my hands, and every step I took with my legs was difficult. Watching my companions carrying water and digging ditches with so much energy, I felt like a bound-foot woman hobbling along. In the evening, everyone slept soundly, but I couldn't fall asleep for a long time. Could I keep going? My thoughts were very turbulent. At this moment, I seemed to hear the speech of the Party branch secretary of my alma mater at our graduation ceremony: "Socialism is not something that comes by sitting and waiting. Without hard labor, you cannot exchange for a happy life. A Communist Youth League member must withstand the tests of training and life. To realize our great ideals, we must not fear difficulties, but must have strong perseverance and an indomitable spirit to fight against difficulties. Only in this way can we win." I also thought of Sister Liu Hulan, and the story of the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March. My face felt like it was burning, as if I had a fever.

　　With the help of my companions, I regained my strength. I gritted my teeth and endured the pain. Even though blisters appeared on my hands, feet, and shoulders, I always rushed to take on the heavy work first. In just half a month, my physical strength greatly increased, and I didn't feel tired when working. My legs were as fast as flying. I completed the wheat planting task in a timely manner, and also achieved certain results in cultural studies. That year, I was selected as a county labor model and literacy model.

　　Later, the leadership transferred me to work as a teacher at the Chengguan Elementary School in Hua County. Although I didn't say anything, I couldn't let go of my desire to participate in agricultural labor. For some reason, while at school, I kept thinking about the five hundred acres of wheat in the team, which needed fertilization, watering, and middle-tillage management... At night, I seemed to see a boundless field, green wheat seedlings, countless piles of manure, and companions working there enthusiastically, singing with joy, carrying fertilizer, and engaging in friendly labor competitions in full swing. How much I loved the countryside, how much I envied the life of the working people! I repeatedly applied to return to the production team to work, but I didn't get the approval of the leadership for a while.

　　During the summer vacation, I followed my spouse, Shao Fengxue (who works at the Hua County Cadre School), back to Luli Brigade in Qingfeng to visit my parents-in-law. In the Luli Village area, some corn and cotton were growing very well, but some were growing very poorly. At that time, I felt strange. Fengxue told me that this was because the area had a lot of sandy soil and alkali. Everything grew well where the terrain was high, but it was difficult to grow seedlings where the terrain was low. "Can't we change it?" I asked. "We have to change it. We will change it this winter, and next year we will make it a big change. When you come again then, you won't see this phenomenon," a kind middle-aged man walked out of the cotton field and answered firmly. He was Comrade Zhao Shukuo, the Party branch secretary of our Luli Brigade.

　　On the way back to Hua County, I told Fengxue that I wanted to return to Luli Village to participate in agricultural production. He gently advised me, "Education work is also very important. Wouldn't it be good for us to serve the construction of socialism in educational work positions?" In order to stabilize my thoughts, after returning to Hua County, he deliberately took me to stroll around the streets, look at the buildings, and go to the department store to see the colorful brocades and the dazzling merchandise. The streets were wide and flat, and the crowds were constantly flowing. All of this made me feel infinitely excited. However, my determination to go to the countryside to participate in labor was not shaken in the slightest; on the contrary, it made me more deeply realize that how can we not do a good job in agriculture and produce more grain?

　　On July 28, 1958 (lunar calendar), I bid farewell to my mother and Fengxue and arrived at Luli Brigade. Secretary Zhao warmly received me. He said, "Building a new countryside is indeed a very glorious and great cause, but we will also encounter many difficulties. Have you thought about it?" I stood in front of this fatherly secretary and said firmly, "I am a Communist Youth League member, and I came here because I listen to the Party. I have made up my mind that I will not leave the agricultural front until I change the face of my hometown. Wherever there are difficulties, assign me to go there!" "Good!" Secretary Zhao replied, "We'll send you to the most backward Seventh Team to lead the members to change the face of this backward team with the speed of the Great Leap Forward!"

　　The Seventh Team had a total of 450 mu of land, of which 320 mu were sandy, alkaline, and low-lying. It was prone to flooding in rainy weather and drought in dry weather. Crop yields were low, and the production enthusiasm of the members was low. Under the guidance of the Party, we first read to the members the news of how the members of Yingju Commune in Fengqiu County, Henan, worked hard for two years to change their poor face. After repeated study and discussion, everyone summed up the experience of "getting rich depends entirely on hard work" and issued the oath of "rather work hard than endure hardship." Then a high tide of deep plowing, fertilizer accumulation, fertilization, and water conservancy construction was launched. In 1959, this sandy, alkaline, and low-lying land, which had only produced a hundred jin in previous years, achieved an average yield of 250 jin of wheat per mu. In addition to setting aside enough autumn seeds and food for the members, they also sold surplus grain to the state.

　　In the autumn of 1959, the Party branch decided to appoint me as the head of the Luli Brigade Youth Pig Farm. Our twelve breeders studied diligently and worked enthusiastically. In the past year or so, the output of live pigs has rapidly multiplied from 380 to 6,753, and 1.32 million jin of granular fertilizer has been produced from pig manure. It was rated as a red flag pig farm in the county.

　　The Party calls on us to be red in the countryside and expert in the countryside. I have only taken the first step, and the road ahead is very long!

### 决心在农村，扎下红专根

    决心在农村，扎下红专根
    河南清丰韩村公社卢里大队青年养猪场场长　胡文兰
    什么是青年人的远大理想？怎样才能不虚度自己的青春？在党的培养和教育下，三年多来，使我正确地懂得了这个问题。
    1957年夏天，我在河南滑县第一中学毕业了。当我拿着毕业证书高兴地向妈妈报喜的时候，她激动地流着眼泪说：“文兰，不要忘记这是毛主席的恩德呀！”我说：“您放心，我听党的话，决心到明塔第二高级社第十五生产队参加生产了。一定在那里搞出个名堂来。”
    有人问我：“你家住在城里，哥哥和爱人又在城里工作，你为啥偏要到农村去参加劳动呢？”
    我祖辈住在农村，忍饥挨饿多少年，共产党毛主席把我们全家从水深火热中解救出来，在我幼小心灵上，深深地刻下了阶级烙印，使我热爱劳动，热爱农村。
    我到了明塔第二高级社第十五生产队后，党支部非常欢迎我，叫我担任青年突击队队长。当时我又高兴又耽心，一个刚毕业的学生，还没做出一点成绩，领导上就这样看重我，下决心，一定努力干。那时候正在抗旱，我们三十六个青年包打困难，挖土井引水上岗。劳动的头一天还不感觉怎样累，第二天腰腿就有点酸疼，到第三天第四天，我两只手上起了五个血泡，两条腿走一步都很吃力，眼看着同伴们担水、挖沟多有劲，自己确像个小脚妇女扭呀扭的。到了晚上大家都睡的香甜，我又久久不能入眠，能不能支持下去呢？我思想上动荡的很厉害。这时候仿佛听到了母校党支部书记在我们毕业典礼大会上的讲话：“社会主义不是坐着等来的，没有艰苦的劳动，就换不来幸福的生活，一个共青团员要经得起锻炼和生活的考验，要实现我们伟大的理想，就不能怕困难，要有坚强的毅力和百折不挠的精神向困难作斗争，只有这样才能胜利。”我又想到刘胡兰姐姐，想到红军两万五千里长征的故事，脸像被火烤了一样，发起烧来。
    在同伴们的帮助下，我重新鼓起了干劲，我咬紧牙关，忍着疼，尽管手上脚上肩上都起了泡，把重活总是先抢到手，就这样不过半月的时间，我的体力大大增强，做活不觉累，两腿快如飞。适时地完成了种麦任务，并在文化学习上，也取得了一定成绩，就在这年我被选为县劳动模范和扫盲模范。
    后来，领导上调我到滑县城关小学担任教员，当时我嘴里虽没说出什么，但始终丢不下参加农业劳动的志愿，不知是怎么回事，在校里老想着队里那五百多亩麦子，正需要加肥加水，中耕管理……晚上睡觉又仿佛看到一望无际的田野，绿油油的麦苗，数不清的粪堆，伙伴们在那里热情的劳动，喜笑颜开的歌唱、运肥，在你追我赶，友谊的劳动竞赛热火朝天。我多么热爱农村，多么羡慕劳动人民的生活啊！我多次申请回生产队劳动，一时没有得到领导上的批准。
    暑假期间，我跟着我的爱人邵凤学（他在滑县干部学校工作）回到清丰卢里大队探望公婆，卢里村一带，玉米棉花有的长的很好，可是有的长的很差，当时我感到奇怪。凤学告诉我这是因为这一带沙碱性很大，凡是地势高的都长的很好，地势洼的地，就不好长苗。“那不能改变它吗？”我问。“要改变。我们今年冬天就要改，明年就叫它大变，那时候你们再来了，就不会看到这种现象了。”一位和蔼可亲的中年人从棉田走出来，坚定地回答着。他就是我们卢里大队党支部书记赵树科同志。
    在回滑县的路上，我告诉凤学想回卢里村参加农业生产。他温和地劝我说：“教育工作也很重要，我们都在教育工作岗位上，为建设社会主义服务不好吗？”他为了安定我的思想，到滑县后，有意带我逛大街，看大楼，到百货公司看五颜六色的锦缎和那耀眼争光的商品，街道宽广平坦，人群川流不息，所有这些，都使我感到无限的兴奋。然而，我去农村参加劳动的决心，丝毫没有动摇；相反使我更深刻地体会到：要不搞好农业，多打粮食怎么能行呢？
    1958年旧历7月28日，我辞别了妈妈和凤学到了卢里大队。赵书记热情地招待我，他说：“建设新农村确实是很光荣很伟大的事业，但也会遇到很多困难，你想到了吗？”我站在这位慈父般的书记面前，斩钉截铁地说：“我是个共青团员，是听党的话才来的，我下定了决心，不改变家乡面貌，决不离开农业战线，哪里有困难，分配我到哪里去吧！”“好！” 赵书记回答说：“派你到最落后的第七队去，带领社员用大跃进的速度来改变这个落后队的面貌吧！”
    第七队共有土地四百五十亩，光沙碱低洼地就有三百二十亩，下雨涝，久晴旱，庄稼收成低，社员生产情绪低落。我们在党的教导下，首先把河南封丘县应举公社社员苦干两年改变贫困面貌的一篇消息读给社员听。大家经过反复学习讨论，总结出“穷变富全靠干劲”的经验，并发出“宁愿苦战，不愿苦熬”的誓言。接着掀起了深翻土地、积肥、施肥、搞水利高潮。1959年这块历年只产百把斤的沙碱低洼地，达到平均亩产小麦二百五十斤。除留足秋种子和社员口粮外，还卖余粮给国家。
    1959年秋季党支部确定叫我担任卢里大队青年养猪场场长，我们十二个饲养员虚心学习、热心工作，一年多来生猪产量由三百八十头迅速繁殖到六千七百五十三头，用猪粪制颗粒肥料达一百三十二万斤，被评为全县红旗养猪场。
    党号召我们要红在农村，专在农村，我才走了第一步，以后的路长得很哩！
