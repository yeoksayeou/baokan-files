Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: Premier Zhou Enlai's speech at the Soviet Ambassador's reception celebrating the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution:

Dear Ambassador Comrade, Comrades, Friends:

Today is the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, a grand festival for the Soviet people, and a common festival for the proletariat, working people, and all progressive mankind around the world. On behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government, I extend the warmest and most sincere congratulations to the glorious Soviet people, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Soviet government.

Forty-three years ago today, the Russian proletariat and all working people, under the leadership of the great revolutionary teacher Lenin and the Bolshevik Party, launched an armed uprising, overthrew the reactionary rule of the landlords and bourgeoisie, and established the world's first socialist state. The great October Socialist Revolution broke through the chains of imperialism on one-sixth of the earth's landmass and opened a new era in human history, transitioning from capitalism to socialism and communism. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The October Revolution opened up vast possibilities and a realistic path for the liberation cause of the world's people. The October Revolution established a new revolutionary front against world imperialism, extending from the Western proletariat through the Russian Revolution to the oppressed nations of the East."

For forty-three years, the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the glorious Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, have fought arduously, sacrificed blood, and overcome numerous difficulties, finally transforming an economically backward and devastated old Russia into a socialist power with a high level of development in economy, culture, science, and technology. Today, the Soviet Union has entered a historical period of comprehensively building communism. The Soviet people are victoriously realizing the magnificent Seven-Year Plan with high political enthusiasm and selfless labor. There is no doubt that, in a short period of time, the Soviet people will catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist country, the United States, in terms of total industrial and agricultural output and per capita output. Even now, in cutting-edge science and technology, especially in conquering outer space, the Soviet Union has left the United States far behind. In international affairs, the Soviet government and the Soviet people have made unremitting efforts to strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, to safeguard world peace, and to ease international tensions. All these achievements of the Soviet people have greatly enhanced the power and influence of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and strengthened the courage and confidence of the world's people in striving for peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism. The Chinese people regard the achievements of the fraternal Soviet people as their own. The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the Soviet people on their new and greater achievements in the cause of building Communism and safeguarding world peace and security.

The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the October Revolution.  The Chinese people are victoriously advancing along the road of the October Socialist Revolution. Since 1958, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, holding high the three red banners of the General Line for Socialist Construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have continuously achieved new victories on all fronts of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and have realized the sustained leap forward of the national economy. The Soviet people and the Soviet government have given the Chinese people tremendous assistance in the cause of socialist construction in China.  For this, the Chinese people and the Chinese government express their heartfelt gratitude.

China, like all socialist countries, has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy, and has always supported the Soviet Union's initiatives and efforts to oppose imperialist aggression, safeguard world peace, and ease international tensions. The Chinese people and the Chinese government have always advocated the realization of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems on the basis of the Five Principles. This year alone, our government has successively signed treaties of friendship and non-aggression or treaties of peace and friendship with the governments of some Asian and African countries; not long ago, it also signed the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty with the government of the Union of Burma. In the future, we will continue to make unremitting efforts to oppose imperialist aggression and safeguard the world peace.

Comrades, friends! The friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, have undergone long-term tests in the years of revolution and war, and in the years of peaceful construction. Our two peoples are clearly aware of the great significance of the great friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples for maintaining world peace and striving for the common cause of human progress. The Chinese people, in the past, present, and future, will always advance bravely alongside the great Soviet people and the peoples of other socialist countries for our common cause.

Now, I propose a toast:

    For the great October Socialist Revolution,
    For the great victory of Marxism-Leninism,
    For the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples,
    For the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    For the friendship of the people of all countries in the world,
    For world peace,
    To the health of the leading comrades of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government headed by Comrade Khrushchev,
    To the health of Comrade Brezhnev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union!

    沿着十月革命道路胜利前进
    周恩来总理在苏联大使庆祝十月革命节招待会上的讲话
    新华社7日讯　周总理在苏联驻华大使庆祝十月社会主义革命四十三周年招待会上的讲话亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天是伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年，是苏联人民的盛大的节日，也是全世界无产阶级、劳动人民和全体进步人类的共同节日。我谨代表中国人民、中国共产党和中国政府向光荣的苏联人民、苏联共产党和苏联政府致以最热烈、最诚挚的祝贺。
    四十三年前的今天，俄国无产阶级和全体劳动人民，在伟大的革命导师列宁和布尔什维克党的领导下，举行了武装起义，推翻了地主和资产阶级的反动统治，建立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。伟大的十月社会主义革命，在地球六分之一的土地上冲破了帝国主义的锁链，开辟了人类历史从资本主义过渡到社会主义、共产主义的新纪元。正如毛泽东同志所说：“十月革命给世界人民解放事业开辟了广大的可能性和现实的道路。十月革命建立了一条从西方无产者经过俄国革命到东方被压迫民族的新的反对世界帝国主义的革命战线。”
    四十三年来，伟大的苏联人民在光荣的苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，经过艰苦奋斗、流血牺牲，战胜重重困难，终于把一个经济落后、满目疮痍的旧俄国建设成为一个在经济、文化、科学技术上都具有高度发展水平的社会主义强国。今天，苏联已经进入全面展开建设共产主义的历史时期。苏联人民正以高度的政治热情和忘我的劳动，胜利地实现着宏伟的七年计划。毫无疑问，用不着很长的时间，苏联人民将在工农业总产量和按人口平均计算的产量方面，赶上和超过资本主义生产最发达的美国。就是在现在，在尖端科学技术方面，特别是在征服宇宙空间方面，苏联已经把美国远远地抛在后面。在国际事务方面，苏联政府和苏联人民为争取不同社会制度国家和平共处，为维护世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势做了不懈的努力。所有苏联人民的这些成就，都大大增强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力和影响，加强了世界人民争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的勇气和信心。中国人民把兄弟的苏联人民的成就，看成是自己的成就。中国人民衷心地祝贺苏联人民在建设共产主义和维护世界和平和安全的事业中，取得新的更大的成就。
    中国革命是十月革命的继续。中国人民正在沿着十月社会主义革命的道路胜利前进。自1958年以来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，高举社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个战线上，都不断地取得了新的胜利，实现了国民经济的持续跃进。苏联人民和苏联政府，在中国的社会主义建设事业中，给予了中国人民以巨大的援助。对此，中国人民和中国政府表示衷心的感谢。
    中国像所有社会主义国家一样，一贯奉行和平的外交政策，一贯支持苏联关于反对帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势的倡议和努力。中国人民和中国政府一向主张在五项原则的基础上，实现不同社会制度国家的和平共处。今年以来，我国政府同一些亚非国家的政府先后签订了友好和互不侵犯条约或者和平友好条约；不久以前，还同缅甸联邦政府签订了中缅两国边界条约。今后，我们仍将为反对帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平作出坚持不懈的努力。
    同志们，朋友们！建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的中苏两国人民的友谊和团结，在革命和战争的年代里，在和平建设的岁月中，经历了长期的考验。我们两国人民都清楚地知道，中苏两国人民的伟大友谊和团结对于维护世界和平、争取人类进步的共同事业有着多么重大的意义。中国人民过去、现在和将来，都永远同伟大的苏联人民和其他社会主义国家的人民一道，为我们的共同事业而奋勇前进。
    现在，我提议：
    为伟大的十月社会主义革命，
    为马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利，
    为中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚强的团结，
    为世界各国人民的友好，
    为世界和平，
    为以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的领导同志们的健康，
    为苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席勃列日涅夫同志的健康，
    干杯！
