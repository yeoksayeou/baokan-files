    A Genius of Russian and World Literature
    —In Commemoration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of Leo Tolstoy's Death
    [Soviet Union] I. Vostrikov

    Gorky once said, recalling Lenin, how Lenin spoke of Leo Tolstoy with such pride and admiration: "What a giant, oh! What a great figure! This is a true artist... Who in Europe can compare with him?... No one."

    Tolstoy's artistic legacy is immense. It illuminates almost an entire century, especially the second half of the 19th century, of Russian life. With astonishing realism and insurmountable skill, he depicted pre-revolutionary Russia: the feudal serf system, the plundering of landlord capitalists, the extravagance of the propertied classes, and the poverty and powerlessness of the working people. He portrayed all the contradictions and difficulties of Russian life through its most essential characteristics. In Lenin's words, "L. Tolstoy was able to raise so many significant questions in his works, able to achieve such great artistic power, that his works occupy a prominent place in world literature." (Lenin, "Collected Works," Vol. 16, Chinese Edition, p. 321)

    Tolstoy's most brilliant work is the novel "War and Peace," written in the 1860s. It is a grand panorama depicting Russian social life in the early 19th century. Here, Tolstoy places the heroic Russian people first and foremost. During the Patriotic War of 1812, the Russian people defended their homeland with their own bodies, saving it from foreign invasion. The author showcases the imposing and indomitable power of the Russian army, a force that routed Napoleon's troops. With affection, the author depicts unforgettable figures: the great Russian commander Kutuzov, the resolute and composed General Bagration, the courageous and steadfast partisan leader Denisov, and many other heroes of the Patriotic War. The novel also reveals the power of the patriotism of the masses in opposition to the false "patriotism" of the Tsarist court and the aristocratic "upper class." The reader sees representatives of this "upper class," such as Prince Vasily, Anna Scherer, Boris Drubetskoy, and other aristocratic social figures, who are indifferent to the fate of their country and people. Following the truth of life, Tolstoy depicts with sympathetic strokes the unforgettable images of outstanding representatives of the aristocratic intelligentsia, such as Andrei Bolkonsky and Pierre Bezukhov, who sympathize with the oppressed people and strive to improve the conditions of the serf peasants.

    In the novel "War and Peace," there are more than five hundred characters, each with a unique personality, each with an inner life that attracts and moves the reader.

    The work could not help but reflect the contradictions in Tolstoy's worldview. While depicting the selfless struggle of the Russian people against Napoleon's invasion, Tolstoy also created the false image of Platon Karataev, whose servile obedience and religiously forgiving nature are portrayed as if they were characteristics of the Russian peasantry. Of course, this image cannot represent the Russian peasants, who produced warriors like Pugachev, Razin, and Bolotnikov. Nor can it represent the masses who, in 1812, took up arms based on ardent patriotism and rose up in unison against Napoleon's army, defeating the invaders.

    Violating his own erroneous philosophical premises, Tolstoy powerfully and movingly expressed the people's anger, their love for their country, their initiative, and their determination, making "War and Peace" a true epic of the Russian nation and a masterpiece of world literature.

    In the 1870s, Tolstoy wrote the novel "Anna Karenina" based on contemporary real life. This novel reflects the disintegration of the feudal serf system and the growth of capitalist social relations. In this work, the author exposes the aristocratic bourgeois society, the idle "upper class," where people live according to hypocritical and inhuman moral concepts, where egoism, shamelessness, and hypocrisy reach their peak. The author depicts how a young woman with a pure and bright heart, like Anna Karenina, is crushed in this cannibalistic society.

    Like "War and Peace," Tolstoy created a series of immortal artistic images in "Anna Karenina," living characters with passion and anxiety. There is Anna's husband, Karenin, a cold and ruthless bureaucrat who hides his cruelty behind the "upper class's" facade of propriety and Christian piety. There is Vronsky, a playboy whom Anna loves and who awakens his deep affection. However, Vronsky cannot break with the aristocratic society that condemns Anna Karenina and personally pushes his beloved woman to destruction. There is the educated aristocratic landowner Levin, who tries to help the peasants under his rule, trying to live with them "according to truth" and "according to conscience," but due to capitalist social relations, he remains an exploiter after all. With delicate and exquisite artistic skill, the author created these and many other characters in the novel, and very deeply revealed their inner worlds. Therefore, "Anna Karenina" deserves to be listed as one of the great works of world literature.

    However, the novel "Anna Karenina" reflects the contradictions and limitations of Tolstoy's worldview. While denying the bourgeois system, the author criticizes this system from the standpoint of "eternal" principles of morality and justice. He sympathizes with the landowner Levin, whose spiritual exploration culminates in the recognition of religion. Tolstoy condemns Anna Karenina from the point of view of Christian morality, saying that she destroyed the family, although the author also defends her and exposes all the hypocrisy and shamelessness of the aristocratic bourgeois family.

    From 1889 to 1899, Tolstoy was engaged in writing the novel "Resurrection." During these ten years, he created this amazing work, which is also the peak of Tolstoy's realism. In this novel, he exposes the class contradictions of aristocratic bourgeois society with the power of extraordinary artistic truth. In "Resurrection," the author rebels against the fundamental system of autocracy, attacks the upper echelons of the Tsarist bureaucracy, exposes the comedy of the Tsarist court, reveals the hypocrisy of the church as an accomplice in the state's enslavement of the people, and tears off all the masks of the landlord capitalist system.

    The author depicts the life tragedy of Katyusha Maslova, a woman from the folk, who is sentenced to penal servitude on trumped-up charges. This tragedy unfolds against the backdrop of the tragic lives of all the oppressed and powerless people.

    Tolstoy wrote about how the Tsar's high-ranking officials, ministers, governors, judges, prison guards, and police, these packs of foxes and dogs who protect the interests of the ruling class, ride roughshod over millions of ordinary workers like Katyusha Maslova. Tolstoy portrays the images of figures from the people with sincere and fervent sympathy. He sympathizes with peasants, workers, carpenters, shoemakers, and others engaged in heavy labor and suffering under the oppression of the autocratic police system. The author points out that the moral qualities of these people are much higher than those of the so-called gentlemen.

    So, how should one fight against the social evils so vividly depicted in the novel "Resurrection"? Tolstoy did not understand the great historical role played by the proletariat in the struggle for the liberation of the working people. He answered the question based on his advocacy of so-called "moral self-improvement." The writer tried to prove that the way to eradicate the decadent socio-political system seemed to lie in Christian love and forgiveness.

    Despite advocating "moral self-improvement," the novel "Resurrection," with its profound realism and artistic images of real life, nevertheless opposed unjust social relations and the dark and evil forces that protect inhuman social systems.

    Tolstoy's great contribution to Russian and world literature is inestimable. Even his novellas and short stories, such as "The Cossacks," "Two Hussars," "A Landlord's Morning," "Polikushka," "Kholstomer," and many other works, are enough to win the great writer world renown.

    Tolstoy was one of Lenin's favorite writers. Lenin attached great importance to Tolstoy's activities and the struggles of various socio-political currents surrounding him. Lenin wrote a series of articles about this great Russian writer between 1908 and 1911: "Leo Tolstoy as a Mirror of the Russian Revolution," "L.N. Tolstoy," etc. In these articles, Tolstoy's creation received its due evaluation for the first time. Lenin's articles on Tolstoy are a model of profound Marxist analysis of the writer's artistic creation.

    Lenin pointed out that Tolstoy reflected in his works the most essential content of Russian life, the most prominent features, strengths, and weaknesses of the First Russian Revolution. Lenin pointed out the direct connection between Tolstoy's creation, his entire viewpoint, and the ideological system of the old Russian patriarchal peasantry. Lenin pointed out that Tolstoy's doctrine combines the protests and hopes of millions of peasants. In Tolstoy's creation, two aspects are intertwined: on the one hand, the most sober realism, the relentless criticism of all state, church, social, and economic systems based on the enslavement of the masses, the passionate protest against social evils, and the opposition to social hypocrisy; on the other hand, the fanatical advocacy of "non-violent resistance to evil," the call for "moral self-cultivation," and the cultivation of a most ingenious and therefore particularly vicious clericalism. Lenin exposed the reactionary content of Tolstoyism and attacked those bourgeois liberals who beautified Tolstoyism, defended it, and thus were used by the reactionaries.

    Tolstoy, as an artist, played an outstanding role in the development of his country's literature. Chekhov and Gorky were deeply influenced by him. Soviet writers Sholokhov, Fadeyev, Fedin, and others have learned from Tolstoy the art of delving into the essence of life processes and creating realistic, flesh-and-blood characters. Tolstoy's artistic legacy also has great world significance. Progressive Western writers (Romain Rolland, John Galsworthy, Theodore Dreiser, etc.) admired the enormous power of Tolstoy's artistic genius and used the rich experience of this Russian writer in their own creations.

    In Tsarist Russia, the vast majority of the people were illiterate, and only a few people knew Tolstoy at that time. Lenin wrote: "In order to make his great works truly accessible to all the people, it is necessary to struggle, to struggle against the social system that keeps millions of people in ignorance, degradation, servitude, and poverty, it is necessary to carry out a socialist revolution." (Lenin, "Collected Works," Vol. 16, Chinese Edition, p. 321)

    The Great October Socialist Revolution opened up broad avenues for the people of the Soviet state to develop science, culture, and art. Tolstoy's richest literary legacy has become truly national property in the Soviet era. In the Soviet Union, the works of this genius Russian writer are printed in millions of copies in many national languages.

    Tolstoy's artistic creation is a pearl of Russian culture. The novels, novellas, and short stories of this greatest language artist are proof that the Russian language has world significance. Millions upon millions of people in countries around the world are learning Russian in order to read the original works of Lenin, Tolstoy, and Gorky. Tolstoy's literary legacy has great significance. Gorky wrote of Tolstoy: "The Russian life he described to us is almost as much as all the other literary works in our country combined... Without familiarity with Tolstoy's works, one cannot consider oneself knowledgeable about one's own country, nor can one consider oneself a cultured person."

    Tolstoy's works, which combine profound ideological content with perfect artistic form, give readers aesthetic enjoyment and develop their artistic interests. The brilliant creation of the genius language artist Tolstoy belongs not only to the past, but also to the present and the future.

    俄国和世界文学的天才
    ——为纪念列甫·托尔斯泰逝世五十周年而作
    〔苏联〕伊·沃斯提舍夫
    高尔基在回忆列宁的时候曾经说，列宁怀着多么自豪和赞叹的心情谈到列甫·托尔斯泰：“怎样一个巨人啊，噢！一位多伟大的人物！这才是艺术家呢……在欧洲有谁能和他媲美呢？……一个也没有。”
    托尔斯泰的艺术遗产是巨大的。它照亮了几乎整整一百年的、特别是十九世纪下半期的俄罗斯的生活。他以惊人的真实性和不可逾越的技巧，描绘了革命前的俄国：封建农奴制度、地主资本家的掠夺、有产者们的骄奢淫逸以及劳动人民的贫困和无权。他通过俄罗斯生活的最本质的特征刻划了它的一切矛盾和困难。用列宁的话来说，“列·托尔斯泰在自己的作品里能以提出这么多重大的问题，能以达到这样大的艺术力量，使他的作品在世界文学中占了第一流的位子。”（《列宁全集》第十六卷，中文版，第321页）
    托尔斯泰的最辉煌的作品，是他在六十年代写成的长篇小说《战争与和平》。这是一幅描绘十九世纪初期俄国社会生活的巨画。在这里，托尔斯泰把英雄的俄国人民摆在首位。俄国人民在1812年卫国战争中，以自己的胸膛捍卫了祖国的土地，使它免受异族的蹂躏。作者展示了俄罗斯军队的威严的百折不挠的威力。这种力量使拿破仑的军队狼狈不堪。作者怀着热爱的心情描绘了令人难忘的形象：伟大的俄国统帅库图左夫、刚毅沉着的巴格拉齐昂将军、英勇坚贞的游击队首领邓尼索夫以及其他好多卫国战争的英雄。这部小说里也显示了人民群众的爱国主义对抗沙皇宫廷、贵族“上流社会”的虚伪的“爱国主义”的力量。读者看到这个“上流社会”的代表，就是伐西里王爵、安娜·舍雷尔、包力斯·德鲁别兹加亚，以及其他贵族社交界人物，他们对于祖国和人民的命运无动于衷。托尔斯泰遵循生活的真实，以同情的笔触描写了贵族知识界优秀代表人物的令人难忘的形象。例如，安德烈·鲍尔康斯基、皮耶尔·白祖霍夫。他们同情被压迫人民，力图改善农奴制农民的境遇。
    在《战争与和平》这部长篇小说中出现的人物达五百多个，每一个人物都有其独特的性格，每一个人物都有其足以吸引和激动读者的内心生活。
    这部作品不能不反映托尔斯泰世界观的矛盾。托尔斯泰在描写俄国人民反对拿破仑入侵的忘我斗争时，还创造了普拉顿·卡拉塔耶夫这样一个虚伪的形象。他身上的那种奴性的顺从和宗教式的宽恕一切的性格，被写成仿佛是俄国农民性格的特征。当然，这个形象不能体现俄国的农民，俄国农民曾经产生了布加乔夫、拉辛、鲍洛特尼科夫这样一些战士。这个形象也不能体现这样的人民群众，他们在1812年基于火热的爱国主义，拿起武器，同仇敌忾地奋起反抗拿破仑的大军，并且打垮了侵略者。
    托尔斯泰违背了自己的错误的哲学前提，有力和激动人心地表达了人民的愤怒、他们对祖国的热爱、他们的主动精神和决心，使《战争与和平》这部小说真正成为俄国民族的英雄史诗，成为世界文学的杰作。
    在七十年代，托尔斯泰根据当代的现实生活，写了长篇小说《安娜·卡列尼娜》。这部小说反映了封建农奴制度的分崩离析和资本主义社会关系的成长。在这部作品里，作者揭露了贵族资产阶级社会、游手好闲的“上流社会”。在这里，人们按照虚伪的毫无人性的道德观念生活；在这里，利己主义、寡廉鲜耻和假仁假义到了登峰造极的地步。作者描写了像安娜·卡列尼娜这样一个心地纯洁明朗的青年妇女，在这种人吃人的社会里怎样受到摧残。
    正如《战争与和平》一样，托尔斯泰在《安娜·卡列尼娜》一书中，创造了一批不朽的艺术形象，那是些有热情，有焦虑的活的人物。这里有安娜的丈夫卡列宁，一个冷酷无情的官僚，他在那“上流社会”的品行端方和基督教的虔诚的幌子下，掩饰了自己的残酷。这里有渥伦斯基，一个花花公子，安娜爱他，并且唤起了他的深挚的爱情。但是，渥伦斯基却不能同那谴责安娜·卡列尼娜的贵族社会决裂，而亲手把心爱的女人推上了毁灭的道路。这里有那个有教养的贵族地主列文，他企图帮助他统治下的农民，极力要“凭真理”、“凭良心”和他们在一起生活，但是由于资本主义的社会关系，他毕竟仍旧是一个剥削者。作者以纤细精湛的艺术技巧，创造了小说中的这些以及其他许多人物，并且非常深刻地揭示了他们的内心世界。因此，《安娜·卡列尼娜》无愧于列为世界文学的伟大作品之一。
    但是，《安娜·卡列尼娜》这部小说里，反映了托尔斯泰世界观的矛盾及其局限性。作者一面否认资产阶级制度，一面又基于道德和正义的“永恒”原理的立场来批判这种制度。他同情地主列文，而列文的精神上的探索是以承认宗教为归宿的。托尔斯泰从基督教道德的观点出发谴责安娜·卡列尼娜，说她破坏了家庭，虽然作者同时也为她辩护，并且揭穿了贵族资产阶级社会家庭的全部虚伪和寡廉鲜耻的面目。
    从1889年到1899年，托尔斯泰从事长篇小说《复活》的写作。在这十年内，他创作了这一部惊人的作品。它同时也是托尔斯泰现实主义的顶峰。在这部小说里，他以非凡的艺术真实的力量，揭发了贵族资产阶级社会的阶级矛盾。在《复活》一书中，作者反抗专制的根本制度，抨击上层的沙皇官僚，暴露沙皇法庭的喜剧，揭穿教会作为国家奴役人民的帮凶的伪善面目，他撕下了地主资本家制度的一切假面具。
    作者描绘了卡丘霞·玛斯洛娃这个民间妇女的生活悲剧。她被以莫须有的罪名判处苦役徒刑。这个悲剧是以全体被压迫的无权无势的人民的悲剧生活为背景而展开的。
    托尔斯泰写出了，沙皇的大官僚、大臣、省长、法官、狱吏、警察，这些保护统治阶级利益的狐群狗党，如何骑在像卡丘霞·玛斯洛娃这样的千百万普通劳动者头上作威作福。托尔斯泰以真挚火热的同情心描绘了来自人民的人物形象。他同情农民、工人、木匠、鞋匠及其他从事繁重劳动、遭受专制警察制度压迫的人们。作者指出，这些人的道德品质比所谓老爷们要高尚得多。
    那末，怎样同小说《复活》中如此鲜明描绘的社会罪恶进行斗争呢？托尔斯泰没有理解无产阶级在争取劳动人民解放的斗争中所起的伟大历史作用。他根据自己宣扬的所谓“道德上的自我修养”，回答了所提出的问题。作家力图证明，铲除没落的社会政治制度的道路，仿佛在于基督教的爱和宽恕一切。
    尽管宣扬“道德上的自我修养”，小说《复活》毕竟以其深刻的现实主义、生活真实的艺术形象，反对了不公正的社会关系，反对了那些保护毫无人性的社会制度的黑暗邪恶的势力。
    托尔斯泰对于俄国和世界文学的伟大贡献，是无可估量的。甚至他的那些中篇和短篇小说，如《哥萨克》、《两个骠骑兵》、《一个地主的早晨》、《波里库希卡》、《霍尔司多麦尔》以及其它好多作品，也都足使这位伟大的作家获得世界的荣誉。
    托尔斯泰是列宁最喜爱的作家之一。列宁极为重视托尔斯泰的活动以及各种社会政治流派围绕着他而进行的斗争。列宁在1908—1911年间曾写过一系列关于这位伟大俄国作家的文章：《列甫·托尔斯泰是俄国革命的镜子》、《列·尼·托尔斯泰》等等。在这些文章中，托尔斯泰的创作第一次得到了应有的评价。列宁关于托尔斯泰的文章，是对作家的艺术创作进行深刻的马克思主义分析的典范。
    列宁指出，托尔斯泰在他的作品中反映了俄罗斯生活的最本质的内容、第一次俄国革命的最显著的特征、力量和弱点。列宁指出了托尔斯泰的创作、全部观点和旧的俄国宗法制农民的思想体系之间的直接联系。列宁指出，在托尔斯泰的学说中，溶合着千百万农民的抗议同他们的希望。在托尔斯泰的创作中，交织着两方面的因素：一方面是最清醒的现实主义、对以奴役群众为基础的所有国家的、教会的、社会的、经济的制度进行无情的批判，热情地抗议社会罪恶，反对社会上的虚伪；另一方面是狂信地鼓吹“不用暴力抵抗邪恶”，呼吁“道德上的自我修身”，培养一种最精巧的因而是特别恶劣的僧侣主义。列宁揭发了托尔斯泰主义的反动内容，抨击了那些他们美化托尔斯泰主义，替它辩护，从而为反动派所利用的资产阶级自由主义分子。
    托尔斯泰作为艺术家，在发展祖国的文学中起了杰出的作用。契呵夫和高尔基，曾受到他的深厚影响。苏联的作家萧洛霍夫、法捷耶夫、费定及其他等人，从托尔斯泰那里学到了深入生活过程实质的艺术，以及创造真实的充满血肉的人物性格的本领。托尔斯泰的艺术遗产也具有巨大的世界意义。西方进步的大作家（罗曼·罗兰、德·高尔斯华绥、德莱塞等）钦佩托尔斯泰艺术天才的巨大威力，并且在自己的创作中运用了这位俄国作家的丰富经验。
    在沙皇俄国时代，绝大多数人民是文盲，那时只有很少的人知道托尔斯泰。列宁写道：“为了使他的伟大作品真正为全体人民所共有，必须进行斗争，为反对那使千百万人陷于愚昧、卑贱、苦役和贫穷境地的社会制度进行斗争，必须进行社会主义革命。”（《列宁全集》第十六卷，中文版，第321页）
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，为苏维埃国家的人民群众开辟了发展科学、文化、艺术的广阔道路。托尔斯泰的最丰富的文学遗产，在苏维埃时代成了真正全民的财产。在苏联，以许多种民族文字，成千百万册地刊印这位天才的俄国作家的作品。
    托尔斯泰的艺术创作，是俄罗斯文化的珍珠。这位最伟大的语言艺术家的长篇、中篇和短篇，是俄罗斯语言具有世界意义的明证。世界各国千千万万的人为了阅读列宁、托尔斯泰、高尔基的原作而学习俄文。托尔斯泰的文学遗产，具有巨大的意义。高尔基关于托尔斯泰写了这样的话：“他向我们描述的俄罗斯生活，几乎和其他我国所有文学作品所写的一样多……不熟悉托尔斯泰的作品，就不能认为自己通晓自己的祖国，不能认为自己是个有文化的人。”
    深刻思想内容同完美艺术形式相结合的托尔斯泰的作品，使读者得到美的享受，发展他们的艺术兴趣。天才的语言艺术家托尔斯泰的辉煌创作，不仅属于过去，而且属于现在和将来。
