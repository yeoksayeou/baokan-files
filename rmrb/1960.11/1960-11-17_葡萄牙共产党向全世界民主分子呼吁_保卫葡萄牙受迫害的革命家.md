    Portuguese Communist Party Appeals to Democrats Worldwide
    Defend Persecuted Revolutionaries in Portugal
    Xinhua News Agency, Rome: According to a "Unidade" Lisbon dispatch, the Portuguese Communist Party has appealed to democrats worldwide to defend political prisoners in Portugal.

    The appeal lists the facts of the brutal persecution of democrats by Salazar's secret service. For example, Fogas, a member of the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, has already been forced to serve more than ten years of fascist hard labor, but he was recently arrested again. Another member of the Central Committee, Miguel, is also imprisoned in Salazar's torture chambers and is even forbidden from receiving things passed on to him. The famous Portuguese social activist, Ventura, has been persecuted for seventeen years. She is now seriously ill, but the authorities still forbid her relatives from visiting her in prison.

    葡萄牙共产党向全世界民主分子呼吁
    保卫葡萄牙受迫害的革命家
    新华社讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：“团结报”里斯本通讯报道，葡萄牙共产党向全世界民主分子呼吁保卫葡萄牙的政治犯。
    呼吁书列举了萨拉查特务机关残暴地迫害民主分子的事实。例如，葡萄牙共产党中央委员会委员福加斯已经被迫服了十多年的法西斯苦役，但不久前他又再次被捕。另一位中央委员会委员米盖尔也被监禁在萨拉查的拷问室里，甚至禁止他接受转交给他的东西。著名的葡萄牙社会活动家凡土拉受迫害已经有十七年了。现在她身患重病，但是当局还是禁止她的亲人前来监狱探望。
