The Qingcheng People's Commune Party Committee in Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, since July, has adopted the method of going deep into the grassroots and using the "three-seven system" to vigorously organize production team cadres to deeply study the Party's guidelines and policies, improve the policy level of team cadres, and improve leadership methods.  This has made team work more meticulous, down-to-earth, and in-depth, effectively promoting the development of various tasks.

The Qingcheng People's Commune has twenty-five production teams and one hundred and seventy-five small teams, with many mountains and few rivers, and a vast area. Therefore, strengthening the leadership of small teams is even more important in this commune. With the rapid development of agricultural production, the small team cadres deeply feel that they must earnestly study the Party's guidelines and policies and arm their minds with policies in order to do a good job in production. Faced with this situation, the commune Party committee, after repeated discussions and research, adopted a method of directly reaching the bottom line, allowing the Party's guidelines and policies to directly meet with the small team cadres and quickly be implemented among the broad masses.

Their method of organizing small team cadres to study policies is mainly to closely integrate policy study with the production movement. At the beginning of the study, the commune Party committee clearly put forward to the small team cadres the purpose of the study and the principle of closely integrating policy study with the current production movement. For example, in September of this year, during the tense stage of the "three autumns" work, the commune Party committee found that some small team cadres had developed feelings of fear of difficulty and slackening due to the inability to allocate labor. Therefore, the commune Party committee organized small team cadres to repeatedly study and discuss the central government's instructions on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and the experience of various places in mobilizing labor to strengthen the agricultural front line, so that the labor force invested in the agricultural production front line increased from the original 6,350 people to 7,569 people. In addition, 760 auxiliary laborers were mobilized to participate in agricultural production. At the same time, labor was rationally allocated and used in accordance with local conditions, timing, and people, greatly accelerating the progress of the three autumns and significantly improving the quality of agricultural work.

In terms of learning methods, they divided the production brigades into four areas, with work groups sent by the county and commune cadres taking charge of each area, dividing the work and being responsible for organizing the study. In order to ensure that study and production are not delayed and that learning and work are carried out simultaneously, a rotational learning method is adopted. Small team cadres are divided into two groups each time to study. The first group learns the policies thoroughly, clarifies their thinking, and reaches a consensus before returning to the team to lead production. The second group then continues to study. In this way, not only is it ensured that every small team cadre has the opportunity to study policies, but it also achieves "hot steaming and immediate selling," promptly implementing the learned policies among the masses, quickly turning them into the actual actions of the masses, and effectively promoting the sustained leap forward in production.

In order to ensure regular study, improve study quality and learning effectiveness, they stipulated that each production team Party branch should specifically study the learning problems of small team cadres once every ten days, and check the learning results regularly or irregularly. At the same time, in order to encourage small team cadres to study policies well and implement policies well, a learning evaluation and reward system was also stipulated, with great emphasis on model setting and planting red flags, creating a new atmosphere for small team cadres to earnestly study policies and actively implement policies. Zhou Kegui, the captain of the third team of the Chonglan Production Team, not only seriously studied policies, but also was able to apply policies in light of the actual situation of his team, which greatly changed the production of the entire team. During the evaluation, Zhou Kegui was selected as a model cadre for studying and applying policies, and the commune Party committee called on all small team cadres to learn from Zhou Kegui. Up to now, 210 Zhou Kegui-style small team cadres have emerged, greatly improving the confidence and determination of small team cadres to study and apply policies.

After nearly four months of practice, the cadres of the Qingcheng Commune believe that: organizing small team cadres to study the Party's guidelines and policies through the "three-seven system" has many benefits. The main thing is that it can often study and discuss the Party's various policies, clarify the thinking of small team cadres, make them clear-headed, know what they are doing in everything, and be clear about the central tasks of each period, thereby effectively improving the policy level of small team cadres, and creating a "three fast" style of fast implementation of the Party's policies, fast problem solving, and fast production progress.

    青城公社党委帮助小队干部学习政策
    出现了执行政策快、解决问题快、生产进度快的新气象
    本报讯　甘肃榆中县青城人民公社党委从7月份以来，采取深入基层，运用“三七制”的方法，大力组织生产小队干部深入地学习党的方针政策，提高小队干部的政策水平和改进领导方法，使小队工作更加细致、踏实和深入，有效地推动了各项工作的发展。
    青城人民公社共有二十五个生产队，一百七十五个小队，山多川少，地区辽阔。因此，加强小队领导，在这个公社显得更为重要。随着农业生产的迅速发展，小队干部深深地感到，必须认真学习党的方针政策，用政策武装自己的思想，才能搞好生产。面对着这种情况，公社党委经过反复讨论研究，采取了一竿子插到底的办法，使党的各项方针政策直接和小队干部见面，并迅速地贯彻到广大群众中去。
    他们组织小队干部学习政策的办法，主要是把学习政策和生产运动紧密结合。学习一开始，公社党委就明确的向小队干部提出学习的目的和把学习政策同当前的生产运动紧密结合的原则。如今年9月间，正在“三秋”工作的紧张阶段，公社党委发现部分小队干部，因劳力调配不过来，产生了畏难和松劲情绪。于是，公社党委组织小队干部，反复学习和讨论了中央关于大办农业、大办粮食的指示，和各地调动劳力增强农业第一线的经验，使投入农业生产第一线的劳动力由原来的六千三百五十人增加到七千五百六十九人。此外，还动员了七百六十个辅助劳力参加了农业生产。与此同时，因地、因时、因人制宜地合理调配和使用劳动力，使三秋进度大大加快，农活质量显著提高。
    在学习方法上，他们以生产大队为单位，划成四个片，由县上派去的工作组和公社干部分片包干，分工负责，组织学习。为了做到学习、生产两不误，边学边干，采取轮流学习的办法，小队干部每次分开两批学习，第一批把政策学通，思想明确，认识一致后回到队里领导生产，第二批又接着学习。这样，既保证了每个小队干部都有学习政策的机会，又做到了“热蒸现卖”，把学得的政策及时地贯彻到群众中去，迅速变成群众的实际行动，有效地促进生产持续跃进。
    为了保证经常学习，提高学习质量和学习效果，他们规定各生产队党支部十天要专门研究一次小队干部的学习问题，定期或不定期的检查学习效果。同时，为了鼓励小队干部学好政策、执行好政策，还规定了学习评比奖励制度，大树标兵，大插红旗，使小队干部形成一种认真学习政策、积极执行政策的新风气。崇兰生产队第三小队队长周可贵不仅认真地学习政策，并且还能结合本队的实际情况应用政策，使全小队的生产有很大转变。评比时周可贵被评选为学习和应用政策的模范干部，公社党委号召各小队干部向周可贵学习。到目前为止，涌现出周可贵式的小队干部二百一十人，大大提高了小队干部学习政策、应用政策的信心和决心。
    经过近四个月的实践，青城公社的干部们认为：通过“三七制”的形式，组织小队干部学习党的各项方针政策有很多好处。主要是能够经常研究、讨论党的各项政策，使小队干部思想明确，头脑清醒，做任何事情都心中有数，对每一个时期的中心任务都一清二楚，从而有效地提高了小队干部的政策水平，出现了执行党的政策快，解决问题快，生产进度快的“三快”作风。
