	Steel Concerto
	Yong Kang, Zou Zheng, Shao Yan, Yi Zhen
	Since the beginning of this year, the steel production front in Shanghai has witnessed wave after wave of production upsurges. While steelworkers are racing against time to fight for steel, people have also seen another moving scene: the forces of all aspects of the city are concentrated around the goal of increasing steel production, forming a huge driving force. In recent months, hundreds of machinery and electrical factories in Shanghai have fully collaborated to rush-produce various metallurgical equipment for steel plants, which have been sent to the steel mills batch after batch. Transportation lines on both land and water have been carrying more and more pig iron, ore, and coal from all directions, day and night, to the front of the steel furnaces; commercial personnel scattered throughout the city have also stepped out of their counters, gone deep into the steel mills to understand the needs, and promptly supplied millions of tools, spare parts, and protective equipment.
	All walks of life support the steel industry, responding to the call with immediate action, providing people when needed, and materials when needed.
	In these days of striving for the continuous and stable rise of steel production, there are countless vivid stories of concentrated efforts to support the steel industry on all fronts in Shanghai. The seventy-five-ton overhead crane, which was recently rushed to manufacture through the joint efforts of more than twenty machinery factories and many units, is one of them.
	The origin of this large crane is as follows: The No. 1 Steel Plant's newly built No. 3 converter workshop had good equipment conditions, but the only shortcoming was the lack of a seventy-five-ton overhead crane.
	Immediately after the National Day, the No. 1 Steel Plant submitted this request to the Municipal Metallurgical Industry Bureau, which in turn reported it to the Steelmaking Headquarters directly under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee on the 5th. The Steelmaking Headquarters made a decision on the 6th, agreeing to the request of the No. 1 Steel Plant.
	The headquarters agreed to the addition of a large crane, but a serious problem arose: Shanghai had never built a crane of this style before.
	Could this crane play a role in completing the city's steelmaking plan this year? The cadres of the Steelmaking Headquarters discussed it, and there was only one solution: concentrate the forces of all aspects to fight a battle of annihilation, and strive to complete everything within a month and a half. Thus, a battle to rush-manufacture a seventy-five-ton crane for the No. 1 Steel Plant began.
	Whether the crane is large or small, the first thing needed is blueprints. Many professors and engineers from Jiaotong University, the Shanghai Black Metallurgy Design Institute, and the Design No. 9 Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building rushed to the headquarters upon hearing the news. They discussed it for a day on the 7th, and on the morning of the 8th, they put forward a design plan and established three design teams to search for information everywhere. At this time, the design personnel of the trolley group were the most difficult. They searched the Shanghai Hoisting and Transportation Machinery Factory for a whole afternoon, but the blueprints were still incomplete. Some people advocated taking a plane to the Dalian Crane Factory to find a solution, but a round trip would take too much time. Someone then thought of the Jiangnan Shipyard, which is a large factory and had built a fifty-ton crane in the past, so they might have blueprints for a seventy-five-ton crane. Li Weiming, an engineer from the Black Metallurgy Design Institute, immediately rushed to "Jiangnan." "Jiangnan" did have a set of such blueprints, and they agreed without hesitation when they heard that the steel mill needed it, and took out all the blueprints for the trolley and the large crane.
	As soon as the blueprints were gathered, seven wooden mold factories held a collaboration meeting, processed them overnight according to the blueprints, and within three days, the Shanghai Hoisting and Transportation Machinery Factory received the wooden mold for the trolley. The materials allocated by the higher authorities had not yet been transported, so they immediately took out the pig iron in the warehouse for use first. By the time the materials from the headquarters were transported, the frame of the trolley was almost completed. The workers seized the time for the trolley and turned around to concentrate their efforts to attack the large crane. Because of the materials, the parts for the large crane were delayed by three days compared to the original plan, but the workers concentrated their attack and regained all the three days. More than 130 bearings were needed for the entire crane, and many of them were of special specifications, and there were no goods on the market. The Municipal Materials Bureau, the Metallurgical Bureau, the Agricultural Machinery Company, the Shanghai Bearing Store, the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical First-Level Station, the Rolling Bearing Factory, and the Textile Industry Bureau Bearing Factory concentrated their efforts at this critical point. Everyone held a meeting, and whoever had it would take it out. One collection solved 109 of them. The other twenty or so were later solved through coordination from all sides. When everyone had no way to get the last bearing, the Shanghai Rolling Bearing Factory took it without hesitation, returned to its own factory, and immediately mobilized the masses to deliver the product as scheduled.
	Wherever the manufacturing task of the seventy-five-ton crane went, there was a tense battle scene. After the joint siege by dozens of units, it has now been completed.
	The seventy-five-ton crane is a large and complex product, but in order to create various conditions for increasing production in steel mills, even something as simple as oxygen has sparked a battle.
	The incident happened at the Shanghai Pengpu Machinery Factory. They heard that the demand for oxygen in the steel mills had greatly increased, but a set of oxygen production equipment in the factory had not yet been installed, and everyone wanted it to serve the steel industry as soon as possible. But after an inspection, it was found that many parts were missing. So, the factory's party committee secretary personally took charge and mobilized the masses to carry out a surprise attack. To build a water tower, there were no construction workers, so the workers of the 103rd Engineering Zone of the construction company came to help; without carpenters, all the wood mold workers in the factory were mobilized to participate in the emergency construction. The Hezhong Refrigeration Machinery Factory, which manufactures this kind of equipment, rushed to manufacture the oxygen compressor on the oxygen generator. After all the equipment was installed, no oxygen was produced. The China Gas Refining Factory and the Chemical Research Institute also sent people to assist, and the Hangzhou Oxygen Production Factory also immediately sent experienced workers and technicians after receiving a long-distance call from Shanghai. Later, experienced workers and technicians from many oxygen production units in Shanghai were also invited to disassemble the machine completely, and comprehensively inspect the more than 7,000 pipes inside. Finally, oxygen was finally tamed under the collective strength.
	From the seventy-five-ton crane spanning the entire steelmaking workshop to the oxygen cylinder only as tall as a person, it illustrates the same problem: concentrating forces and fighting a battle of annihilation is the most effective method. It can achieve the effect of complete annihilation and rapid resolution in the shortest possible time. It also shows that as long as we concentrate our strength and use it on the most important aspects, even if we encounter difficulties on our way forward, we can conquer them.
	Concentrating forces to fight a battle of annihilation is not only a matter of force organization, but more importantly, it is built on the conscious foundation of the broad masses. Concentration is not a simple patchwork, not an accumulation of numbers, but through concentration, the wisdom and creativity of people are fully utilized, and many things that people previously thought were impossible are accomplished. The story of the two large valves at the No. 3 Steel Plant is a powerful illustration of this point.
	The No. 3 Steel Plant recently added a twenty-five-ton pig iron furnace. This pig iron furnace is combined with the rolling mill workshop, and there is a water pipe project. By September 6, all the materials had been prepared, but only eight large-sized sleeve-type valves were missing. Purchasing agent Xiao Cao had been running around for half a month and still had made no progress. On this day, he stepped into the door of the Shanghai Building Hardware Wholesale Department, and after talking with the salesperson at the "Support Grain and Steel Special Counter," the problem of six smaller valves was not big, but the two 20-inch large-diameter ones were difficult to solve. The salesperson thought: if the steel mill wants something that we have, we should give it to them, what does it matter; now the steel mill wants something that we don't have, we should find a way to help them solve it, this can be said to be fulfilling the responsibility of our commercial personnel. He immediately reported the requirements of the No. 3 Steel Plant to the leadership, and the party branch secretary decided to concentrate manpower to fight this battle well. That night, more than ten key members held a meeting, and the meeting finally determined four plans: First, send a telegram to the Industrial Equipment Purchasing and Supply Station in Shenyang, because the weather in the north is colder and the water pipes are buried underground, so there may be this kind of sleeve-type large valve; at the same time, call Suzhou, because the Shanghai Water Company had made a batch of large valves there in the past; second, go to various factories in Shanghai that manufacture and use valves to contact them separately; third, go deep into the construction site to see if other types of valves can be used instead; fourth, if the above methods do not work, use other valves for modification and replacement on the premise of ensuring the quality of the project. After the meeting, those who were drafting telegrams drafted telegrams, and those who were making phone calls made phone calls. The next morning, it rained heavily, and except for a few people who maintained the retail business, the wholesale department dispatched twenty-six cadres, braving the rain to inquire in all directions. The deputy manager personally answered the phone in the office. By ten o'clock, the phone calls came back one by one, all saying that there was no progress. He stood up and left, ferrying across the Huangpu River to the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, and found the workers installing water pipes on the construction site. The worker was very excited when he heard that the wholesale department comrades were working hard for their project and that the manager had personally gone to the factory to help. The deputy manager of the wholesale department looked carefully at the construction site and saw that the steel mill's transportation vehicles were coming and going very frequently and the ground was vibrating very strongly. He thought: other valves besides the sleeve-type valves would not be able to withstand the vibration, but he wondered if the wholesale department's existing flange valves could be modified. He returned to the wholesale department and held another meeting in the evening to study the issue. Finally, everyone came up with a solution: add a steel plate welded sleeve outside the flange valve. After the meeting, they also imitated the small-sized sleeve-type valve and drew a sketch. The next day, they took it to the No. 3 Steel Plant and discussed it with the workers. As a result, the No. 3 Steel Plant used steel plates to make two sleeves by themselves according to their sketch, which ensured that the water pipe installation project was completed on schedule.
	Concentrating manpower and material resources from all aspects to fight a battle of annihilation not only guarantees the key points, but also brings some new problems and new imbalances to other aspects after the forces are concentrated, thereby further stimulating the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and further tapping the potential for production. Therefore, concentrating forces to fight a war is not to overwhelm others, but on the contrary, it better drives others. The workers and staff of the Shanghai Machinery Manufacturing Factory have a very deep understanding of this principle. This factory is a machinery factory that manufactures a large number of small mining trains. After accepting the task, the factory arranged and arranged, and the working hours were only 350,000, which was two-thirds short. And in the first seven months of this year, only one-third of the total task was completed. In other words, it is necessary to complete twice as much work in the last four months as in the previous seven months. This seems like an unimaginable thing. What to do? In the face of this serious task, the cadres and workers first inspected the work in the first half of the year and found that the main products in the first half of the year were not completed well enough. The problem was that the forces were scattered, the battle line was too long, a lot of materials were put in, and very few finished products were produced. After discussion, they resolutely adopted a new combat method: concentrate forces and eliminate the "enemy" one by one. In this way, the production potential was fully realized. The products are concentrated, the key points are highlighted, the management is convenient, the task is large but not chaotic, the key problems are clear, and everyone knows what to do. As a result, 32 units were completed in August alone, and 63 units were completed in September. Passive has become active, and the workers are now considering how to strive to complete the plan ahead of schedule.
	It is precisely because people consciously realize that concentrating all their efforts can win greater victories, forces from all directions are pouring into steel mills and pouring into steelmaking furnaces. On the transportation lines in the steel mills, there are many female workers with children. In order to allow them to concentrate on production, the Municipal Women's Federation organized a group of excellent nursery workers to take care of the children for the female workers; the hairdressing industry saw that the cadres and workers of the steel mills were often too busy to remember to get haircuts and shaves, so they sent people to the steel mills to provide services for everyone; the service counters of the post office and the bank were also moved to the gate of the steelmaking workshop, and the workers could mail letters, remit money, and mail packages nearby... All of this constitutes a picture of communist collaboration. As the steelworkers described it: In every furnace of molten steel, there are the labor and wisdom of countless people.

    钢铁协奏曲
    永康　邹峥　绍言　毅臻
    今年以来，上海钢铁战线上，生产高潮一浪高过一浪。就在钢铁工人争分夺秒为钢而战的时候，人们还看到了另一番动人的情景：全市各个方面的力量，都围绕着增产钢铁这个目标集中起来，汇成了一股巨大的促进力量。最近几个月，上海几百家机械、电机工厂全面大协作，为钢铁厂突击赶制的各种冶金设备，一批接一批地送进了钢厂的大门；水陆两路的各条运输线，把成千上万吨、越来越多的生铁、矿石、煤炭，从四面八方，车载船运，日夜兼程地运到了炼钢炉前；分散在全市各处的商业人员，也纷纷走出柜台，深入钢厂，了解需要，及时供应了数以百万计的工具、零部件和保护用品。
    各行各业支援钢铁，真是一呼百应，要人有人，要物有物。
    在这为钢铁生产持续稳定上升而奋斗的日子里，上海各条战线上出现的集中力量支援钢铁的生动故事，多得不胜枚举。最近二十多家机械厂和许多单位通力协作突击赶制的一台吊重七十五吨大行车，就是其中的一个。
    这台大行车的来历是这样的：上钢一厂去年新建的第三转炉车间，虽然设备条件较好，可是美中不足的是缺少一台七十五吨大行车。
    国庆节一过，上钢一厂就把这个要求提给了市冶金工业局，冶金局在5日又向市委直接领导的炼钢指挥部作了报告。炼钢指挥部6日就作出决定，同意了上钢一厂这个要求。
    增加一台大行车这件事情，指挥部是同意了，可是发生了一个严重问题：这种式样的行车上海过去从未造过。
    能不能叫这台行车在完成今年全市炼钢计划中就发挥作用？炼钢指挥部的干部一商量，办法只有一个：集中各方面的力量，打一个歼灭战，并且争取在一个半月内全部完工。于是，一场为上钢一厂赶制七十五吨行车的战斗开始了。
    行车不论大小，第一要有图纸。交通大学、上海黑色冶金设计院、第一机械工业部设计九院等单位的许多教授、工程师，听到这个消息，纷纷赶到指挥部。7日讨论了一天，8日上午就提出了设计方案，并且成立了三个设计小组，到处搜集资料。这时候，小车组的设计人员最困难了，他们在上海起重运输机械厂找了整整一个下午，图纸还是不全。有人主张乘飞机到大连起重机厂去想办法，可是一去一返，太费时间。有人又想起江南造船厂是个大厂，而且过去造过五十吨行车，说不定也有七十五吨行车的图纸。黑色冶金设计院的工程师李蔚明马上赶到“江南”，“江南”果然有一套这样的图纸，他们听说是钢厂需要，一口答应，把小车连大车的图纸，全部拿了出来。
    图纸赶齐，七个木模厂开了个协作会，按照图纸连夜加工，在三天之内，上海起重运输机械厂拿到了小车的木模，上级调拨的材料还未运到，马上把仓库里的生铁拿出来先用，等到指挥部材料运到，小车的架子差不多快要完工了。工人抢得了小车的时间，回转身来又集中力量猛攻大车。大车部件因为材料关系，比原计划迟了三天，工人们这样集中一攻，就把三天的时间全部夺回来了。整台行车上还要用一百三十多只轴承，有许多规格很特殊，市上无货。市物资局、冶金局、农业机械公司、上海轴承商店、上海机电一级站、滚动轴承厂、纺织工业局轴承厂等单位，在这个关键上集中起来了。大家开了个会，谁有就拿出来，一凑就解决了一百零九个。另外二十多只后来又通过各方面的调剂，获得了解决。最后一个轴承，大家都没有办法，上海滚动轴承厂毫不犹豫地接了下来，回到自己厂里，马上发动群众，如期交出了这个产品。
    七十五吨行车的制造任务到那里，那里就出现紧张的战斗场面。经过几十个单位的合力围攻，现在已经完工了。
    七十五吨行车是一件庞大复杂的产品，可是为了钢厂创造各种增产的条件，即使像氧气这种看来比较简单的东西，也掀起了一场战斗。
    事情发生在上海彭浦机器厂。他们听说钢厂氧气的需要量大大增加，而厂里有一套生产氧气的设备还没有安装好，大家都想早一点叫它为钢效劳。谁知一检查，缺了很多部件。于是，厂里党委书记亲自挂帅，发动群众进行突击。造水塔，没有建筑工人，建筑公司一○三工区的工人就赶来帮忙；没有木工，动员全厂木模工参加抢建。制氧机上没有氧压机，制造这种设备的合众冷气机械厂赶制。设备全部装好，还是不出氧气，中国炼气厂、化工研究院也派人前来协助，杭州制氧气厂接到上海的长途电话也马上派来了老师傅和技术人员。后来又把上海许多制氧单位的老工人和技术人员都请了来，把机器全部拆开，里面的七千多根管子，进行全面检查，最后氧气终于在集体的力量下驯服了。
    大到横跨整个炼钢车间的七十五吨大行车，小到只有一个人高的氧气瓶，但说明的却是同一个问题：集中力量，打歼灭战，这是最有效的一种方法，它可以在最短的时间内，收到全歼速决的效果。也同时说明，只要我们把力量集中起来，使用到最主要的方面去，在我们前进的道路上，即使碰到了困难，也是可以征服的。
    集中力量打歼灭战，这不仅是一个力量组织的问题，更重要的是它是建筑在广大群众自觉的基础之上。集中不是简单的凑合，不是数字的累积，而是通过集中，充分发挥出人的智慧和创造，办到了许多原先被人们认为办不到的事情。这一点，上钢三厂两个大阀门的故事，是一个有力的说明。
    上钢三厂最近增加了一座二十五吨化铁炉，这个化铁炉和轧钢车间合在一起，有一项水管工程。到9月6日这一天，各项材料都已备齐，独有八个大尺寸的套筒式阀门没有着落。采购员小曹跑了半个月还是一无进展。这一天，他跨进了上海建筑五金批发部的大门，和“支援粮钢专柜”上的销货员一谈，六个较小的阀门问题不大，就是两个二十吋大口径的不好解决。这个销货员一想：钢铁厂要的东西，我们有，给他们，这算得了什么；现在钢厂要的，我们没有，想办法帮助他们解决，这才可以说是尽到我们商业人员的责任。他把三厂的要求马上向领导作了汇报，党支部书记决定集中人力打好这一仗。当晚，十多个骨干开会，会上最后确定了四个方案：一、打电报给沈阳的工业器材采购供应站，因为北方天气较冷，水管都埋在地下，可能有这种套筒式的大阀门；同时打电话到苏州，因为上海自来水公司过去曾经在那里做过一批大阀门；二、分头到上海各个制造阀门和使用阀门的工厂去联系；三、深入工地，看看用其他式样的阀门能不能代替；四、如果以上办法都不行，在保证工程质量的前提下，用别的阀门加以改装代用。会议结束，拟电报的拟电报，打电话的打电话。第二天一清早，大雨倾盆，批发部除了维持门市营业的几个人以外，出动了二十六个干部，冒雨四出打听。副经理亲自在办公室接电话。到十点多钟，电话一个个打回来了，都说没有着落。他立起身来就走，摆渡过黄浦江赶到上海三厂，在工地上找到了安装水管的工人。那个工人听到批发部同志正在为他们的工程辛苦奔波，经理还亲自下厂帮助时，都很激动。批发部的副经理在工地上仔细看了一下，看到钢厂运输汽车来往非常频繁，地面震动得很厉害，心想：除了套筒式的阀门以外，用别的阀门，会受不住震动，但是不知能否把批发部现有的法兰阀门改装一下呢？他回到批发部，晚上再开会研究，最后大家想了个办法：在法兰阀门外面加装一个钢板焊制的套筒。会后，他们还模仿了小规格的套筒式阀门，画了一个草图。第二天拿到三厂和工人一起商量，结果三厂根据他们的草图，用钢板自制了两只套筒，保证了水管安装工程如期完工。
    把各方面的人力物力集中起来打歼灭战，不仅保证了重点，而且在力量集中以后，会给其他方面带来一些新的问题，出现一些新的不平衡，从而更激发群众的革命热情，进一步挖掘生产的潜力。因此，集中兵力打仗不是压倒其他，相反的是更好地带动了其他。上海机械制造厂的职工们，对这一个道理，体会非常深切。这个厂是一家大量制造矿山小火车的机械厂。接受任务以后，厂里排来排去，工时只有三十五万个，缺了三分之二。而今年头七个月只完成全部任务的三分之一。换句话说，要在最后四个多月内，完成比前七个多月还要多一倍的任务。看来这是件不可想像的事情。怎么办？干部和工人在这严重的任务面前，先检查了上半年的工作，找到上半年主要产品完成情况不够好，毛病就在于力量分散，战线太长，投料很多，成品很少。经过讨论，坚决采取新的作战方法：集中兵力，各个歼灭“敌人”。这样一来，生产潜力充分发挥出来了。产品集中，重点突出，管理方便了，任务大而不乱，关键问题，一清二楚，大家心里都有数。结果，8月份一个月就完成了三十二台，9月份又完成了六十三台。被动变成了主动，工人们现在正在考虑怎样争取提前完成计划了。
    正由于人们自觉地认识到集中全力，才能赢得更大的胜利，四面八方的力量都涌向钢铁厂，涌向炼钢炉。钢铁厂里运输线上，有许多是有孩子的女工，为了让她们集中心思搞好生产，市妇联组织了一批优秀的保育员，为女工们带孩子；理发业看到钢厂的干部和工人，常常忙得忘记了理发刮胡子，他们就派人到钢厂为大家服务；邮局、银行的服务台也搬到炼钢车间的大门口，工人们寄信、汇款、寄包裹，都近在眼前……。这一切，构成了一幅共产主义大协作的图画。正如钢铁工人所描写的那样：在每一炉钢水里，都包含着无数人的劳动和智慧。
