Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 12th -- In recent years, the Zhonglou Commune in Ju County, Shandong Province, has earnestly implemented the systems of "Three Guarantees and One Reward" (guarantee of output, workdays, and costs, with reward for overproduction) and "Four Fixes" (fixing of labor, land, draught animals, and farm tools), which have mobilized the production enthusiasm of production teams and commune members and promoted great development of production throughout the commune.

When formulating annual production plans, production brigades and production teams of the Zhonglou Commune base them on the actual output of previous years, adhering to the principle of being both active and reliable, and ensuring that the contracted production teams have a surplus to exceed. The production targets are set, and responsibilities are assigned to work groups. During implementation, settlements are made each season, so that summer distribution promotes autumn production and guarantees the realization of the annual production plan. For example, during the summer distribution this year, 155 out of the 252 contracted production teams in the commune received rewards for overproduction, effectively promoting the autumn overproduction campaign and the rapid progress of the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing) work. The rewarded teams have even greater enthusiasm, and the non-rewarded teams are also striving to catch up. For example, the Banlou and Heyu teams in the Hegu Brigade, the cadres and commune members are determined to strengthen the management of autumn crops, with millet and sorghum cultivated and weeded seven or eight times. Each team took funds from sideline income to purchase large quantities of fertilizer, increasing topdressing, so that the yields of early autumn and most late autumn crops exceeded the contracted targets. During the autumn harvest, each production team rationally arranged labor and animal power, carefully harvesting, threshing, re-harvesting, and re-threshing. Early autumn crops such as sorghum, millet, and spring soybeans were generally threshed four or five times, one or two more times than in previous years, achieving three cleanlinesses: clean stalks, clean threshing grounds, and clean field edges. Late autumn crops such as sweet potatoes and peanuts were harvested even more carefully.

After communization, the production brigades of this commune fixed land, labor, draught animals, and farm tools to be managed and used by the production teams. The production teams are allowed to dispose of the production management expenses saved under the condition of fulfilling their contracted production plans. As a result, the enthusiasm of the teams to strengthen land basic construction and protect draught animals and farm tools has been greatly mobilized. Throughout the commune, whether in mountainous thin land or plains and low-lying land, the fields are square and the field boundaries are neat as lines. In addition to stipulating that each team has the right to arrange land planting, the commune also helps each team formulate planting plans according to the soil properties to grasp key production increases and ensure the realization of the contracted production plans. The commune also fixed barren mountains and ridges to the teams for management by dividing them into sections. In the past three years, the commune has reclaimed more than 11,000 mu of new wasteland. After the draught animals were fixed to the production teams, the calves bred by the teams were not only kept by the teams for long-term feeding and use, but the brigade also rewarded the teams with a certain percentage of cash, encouraging the teams' enthusiasm for protecting and breeding young animals. At present, the number of large livestock in the commune has increased from 1,651 head in the early days of communization to 2,276 head this autumn, an increase of 37.8%, and each head is plump and strong.

The production teams of Zhonglou Commune also implement the method of basic work points plus rewards, strictly implement the work evaluation and scorekeeping system, mobilize the production enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, and the vast number of commune members are striving to work more and do more work. Commune members bring a load of manure to work and carry a basket of grass when leaving work, and the production mood is very high. The "Three Autumns" work this year is progressing quickly and well, and the autumn sowing has been expanded by 4,000 mu compared with last year. The yields of early autumn and late autumn crops that have already been harvested this year have exceeded last year's levels.

    中楼公社几年来认真执行三包一奖和四固定制度
    生产小队和社员积极性大大发扬
    促进全社生产大发展，三年新开荒地达一万多亩
    新华社济南12日电　山东莒县中楼公社几年来认真贯彻执行“三包一奖”和“劳力、土地、耕畜、农具四固定”的制度，调动了生产小队和社员的生产积极性，促进了全社生产大发展。
    中楼公社各生产大队和生产小队制订每年包产计划时，都是以常年实际产量为基础，本着既积极可靠、又使包产小队有产可超的原则，订出包产指标，并把责任落实到作业组。在执行中一季一兑现，因而形成夏季分配促进秋季生产，保证全年包产计划的实现。如今年在夏季分配时，全社二百五十二个包产小队，有一百五十五个超产受奖，有效地促进秋季超产运动和三秋工作的迅速进展。受奖的小队生产干劲更大，没有受奖的小队也奋起直追，如河谷大队的板楼、河峪等四个小队，干部和社员都决心对秋季作物加劲管理，谷子、高粱中耕锄草达七、八遍，各小队从副业收入中拿出款来购买大批肥料，增加追肥，因而使早秋和绝大部分晚秋作物的产量都超过了包产指标。在秋收中，各生产小队都合理安排劳力、畜力，精收、细打、复收、复打，高粱、谷子、春大豆等早秋作物，一般打轧四、五遍，比往年多打轧一至二遍，达到秸干、场间、场边三净，甘薯、花生等晚秋作物收得更加细致。
    公社化后，这个社的各生产大队，都把土地、劳力、耕畜、农具固定到生产小队管理使用，生产小队在完成包产计划的条件下，所节约的生产管理费用都归本小队支配，因而，大大调动了小队加强土地基本建设和保护耕畜、农具的积极性。全社无论是山岭薄地还是平原、涝洼地，都是方方块块，地头、地边整齐如线。公社除了规定各小队有安排土地种植权以外，还根据土壤性质帮助各小队因地制宜订种植计划，抓增产关键，保证实现包产计划。公社还把荒山荒岭固定给小队划片分段管理，三年来全社新开荒地达到一万一千多亩。耕畜固定到生产小队后，小队繁殖的幼畜，不仅归本小队长期喂养使用，而且大队还奖给小队一定比例的现金，鼓舞了小队保护和繁殖幼畜的积极性。目前全社大家畜由公社化初期的一千六百五十一头发展到今秋二千二百七十六头，增加37.8％，而且头头膘肥体壮。
    中楼公社各生产队还实行基本工日加奖励的办法，严格执行评工记分制度，调动了广大社员的生产积极性，广大社员都争取多出工、多做工，社员出工带一担粪，收工捎筐草，生产情绪非常高涨。今年三秋工作进行既快又好，秋种比去年扩大四千亩。今年已收获的早秋和晚秋作物产量都又超过去年的水平。
