    Reading Notes
    Zeng Guofan's Obsequiousness to Foreigners
    A Ying
    "The Complete Account of the Tianjin Case" not only exposes the ferocious nature of imperialism through the actions of figures like the French Consul Fontanier, but also confirms the truth of Chairman Mao's statement in "The Bankruptcy of the Idealist Conception of History": "The Xinhai Revolution was a revolution against imperialism. The reason why the Chinese people wanted to revolt against the Qing Dynasty was because the Qing Dynasty was a running dog of imperialism," through the shameless image of the traitorous executioner Zeng Guofan's obsequiousness to foreigners.
    What role did Zeng Guofan, then serving as the Governor-General of Zhili, play in the Tianjin Massacre? None of the books about the case provide a clear explanation. The fact is that if we remove the parts of his memorials about this case that are disguised and used to whitewash himself, and highlight the essential and dominant parts, it becomes very easy to see that he evolved from a "traitorous executioner" to a "slave of imperialism" and an "executioner of imperialism."
    First, Zeng Guofan completely stood on the side of imperialism, whitewashing its crimes and acting as its spokesperson. Zeng Guofan promoted imperialism as civilized and benevolent, denied any persecution suffered by the people at the hands of imperialism, and affirmed that "England and France would never engage in such cruel acts?" and "Judging reasonably, there is no such thing." He said that after "verifying the facts," the events opposed and exposed by the people were "all false accusations" and "all rumors, with no basis in fact." He also said that the reason for these "rumors" was that the people of Tianjin had "accumulated suspicion in their hearts and harbored resentment." Everything was a false accusation against the foreigners. The memorial even revealed the idea that Fontanier's shooting and killing and other illegal acts were provoked by the false accusations of the people: "He is known for benevolence, but he suffered cruel slander, so it is right for the foreigners to be indignant." In Zeng Guofan's view, all responsibility should be borne by the people of Tianjin. He cried out for the wronged foreigners, explained the misunderstandings, and also called on the court to "issue a clear edict, announcing it to the world, so that all may hear it," in order to "clear the foreigners' name" and "clarify justice."
    Second, for the sake of imperialist interests, Zeng Guofan cruelly suppressed the patriotic movement of the people of Tianjin, acting as an executioner for imperialism. Zeng Guofan's attitude towards the people was completely opposite to his attitude towards imperialism. He feared the people, denouncing the people's resistance to imperialist atrocities as "rebellious conduct," believing that this kind of "rebellious conduct should not be tolerated," that it was "frivolous," and that "its frivolity is certainly hateful, but its accumulated suspicion is not the result of a single day." He advocated "arresting and severely punishing them, in order to deter others in the future." His reasoning was: "In China, killing an official should be punished by death, let alone harming many foreign lives, which could lead to war?" But regarding the imperialists' attempts to shoot and kill the Chinese Minister of Trade, attempting to kill the magistrate of Tianjin, and killing the Tianjin magistrate's attendants, he not only did not mention "punishment by death," but did not even utter a "mild criticism." In Zeng Guofan's mind, "foreigners" were untouchable, and "foreign lives" were especially precious. Therefore, he was indignant and cruelly helped imperialism suppress the patriotic people of Tianjin, sentencing twenty-five people, sentencing sixteen to death (one account says: fifteen people were killed, four were exiled to the army, and seventeen were sentenced to imprisonment), and exiling Zhang Guangzao, the Tianjin prefect who had a relatively strong sense of justice, and Liu Jie, the Tianjin magistrate, to Heilongjiang. As Zeng Guofan said in his memorial: "Whatever the French minister requests, if it can be complied with, I will agree," that is to say, he was willing to be an executioner for imperialism.
    Third, Zeng Guofan's shameless and obsequious crimes aroused public outrage among the broad masses of people, forcing him to admit that he felt "internal guilt before the gods, and external shame before public opinion," and that he was "unfit to be a human being." Woren's "secret memorial" defended Zhang Guangzao, exposing Zeng Guofan's denunciation and dismissal of Zhang Guangzao and others for allegedly instigating the Tianjin Massacre at the instigation of the French, which caused a great reaction, saying that "public opinion at home and abroad rose up to criticize him." Zhu Kongzhang's "Separate Biography of Zeng Wenzheng" (Volume 1 of "Biographies of Restored Generals"), although trying its best to defend him, could not erase this event, and had to point out that "the people of Tianjin resented the Duke." Even the novel "Xiaoxian Yanyi," which praised Zeng Guofan, had to write that the people of Tianjin actually "created a great disturbance" because of this, all scolding Zeng Guofan for "sucking up to foreign devils" and "fawning on foreigners," and that his "reputation was greatly damaged." These things forced Zeng Guofan to admit that his actions were "casting a mistake," so-called "internal guilt before the gods, and external shame before public opinion," that is, he did not dare to fully implement the wishes of imperialism, in order to alleviate the people's anger towards him. As for writing poems to discuss this case and criticize Zeng Guofan, there are many examples. The most widely circulated is Wu Dating's "Tianjin Records Poetry" ("Small Chief's Lodge Poetry Collection" Third Series, Volume Down), he opposed forbearance and humiliation, saying "Is there no Han (Shizhong) Yue (Fei) in the world, what about forbearance?" He pointed out the greedy and cunning nature of imperialism: "Other ethnic groups are accustomed to coercion," "Foreign affairs are prone to reversal." But the most expressive of the people's emotions is Xie Xiangbo's "Gengwu Sentiments" in "Nanyue Caotang Drafts"
  (Not included in "Xueqing Pavilion Poetry Collection"):
          It may not start a border war, but seeking peace kills commoners
          Willing to emulate Wei Jiang, offering heads to thank the Xiongnu
          One throw of a desperate gamble, the Central Plains loses its grand plan
          Alas, the tomb of the five martyrs, crows cry every night
    This poem opposes opening the door to invite robbers, opposes humiliating peace, opposes repaying lives and apologizing, opposes killing innocents, praises the murdered as righteous men, and points the finger directly at "Wei Jiang" - the traitorous executioner Zeng Guofan, the traitor Li Hongzhang, and others.

    读书札记
    曾国藩的媚外
    阿英
    《津案始末》不但通过法国领事丰大业这样人物的行动，揭露了帝国主义凶恶的本质，同时也通过像曾国藩这样汉奸刽子手的无耻媚外形象，证实了毛主席在《唯心历史观的破产》里所说的：“辛亥革命是革帝国主义的命。中国人所以要革清朝的命，是因为清朝是帝国主义的走狗”的真理。
    当时身任直隶总督的曾国藩，在天津教案中当了怎样的脚色呢？在有关教案的书里，都没有比较明晰的交代。事实是，如果把他关于此案奏疏中伪装和替自己搽粉的部分去掉，突出本质的、主导的部分，那就很易于看出，他是从“汉奸刽子手”进一步做了“帝国主义的奴才”、“帝国主义的刽子手”。
    第一，曾国藩完全站在帝国主义的立场，替帝国主义洗刷罪恶，做帝国主义的代言人。曾国藩宣扬帝国主义是文明的、仁慈的，否认人民所遭受的帝国主义任何迫害，肯定“英、法各国，岂肯为此残忍之行？”“以理决之，必无其事”。说“确查虚实”的结果，人民所反对、所揭露的事件，“尽属虚诬”、“全系谣传，毫无实据”。并说所以产生这类“谣言”，是由于天津人民“积疑于衷，心怀恚恨”。一切都是冤枉洋人。奏疏里甚至透露着这样的意思，就是说丰大业打枪杀人种种不法行为，也都是受了老百姓的冤枉所激成，“彼以仁慈为名，而反受残酷之谤，宜洋人之忿不平也”。一切责任，在曾国藩看来，全都应该由天津人民负责。他为帝国主义叫苦喊冤，解释误会，还呼吁朝廷，“明降谕旨，布告天下，咸使闻之”，以“雪洋人之冤”，而“昭明公道”。
    第二，曾国藩为着帝国主义的利益，残酷的镇压天津人民的爱国运动，做帝国主义的刽子手。曾国藩对人民的态度，和对帝国主义，是完全相反的。他害怕人民，诋毁人民对帝国主义暴行的反抗是“刁风”，认为这种“刁风尤不可长”，是“浮嚣”，“其浮嚣固属可恶，而其积疑则非一朝一夕之故矣”。主张“捕拿严惩，以儆将来”。理由是：“在中国，戕官毙命，尚当按名拟抵，况伤害外国多命，几开边衅？”而对帝国主义者开枪企图打死中国通商大臣，企图打死天津县，打死了天津县的随从，却不但不谈“拟抵”（就是“偿命”），甚至连“微词”也没有。在曾国藩心目中，“外国人”是碰不得的，“外国命”是特别宝贵的。所以他愤愤不平，就残酷的帮帝国主义镇压天津爱国人民，竟判了二十五个人的罪，处死刑的十六名（一说：杀了十五个人，军流四个人，徒刑十七人），并把比较有正义感的天津府张光藻，天津县刘杰，充戍到黑龙江。真如曾国藩在奏疏里说的：“凡法国使臣所请，苟可依从，臣皆应允”，就是说，当帝国主义的刽子手，他也是心甘情愿的。
    第三，曾国藩这样无耻媚外的罪恶行为，激起了广大人民的公愤，迫使他不能不供认“内疚神明，外惭清议”，“不可为人”。倭仁的“密疏”替张光藻打抱不平，就揭露了曾国藩因法国诬指张光藻等指使教案，将他们奏参革职，交部治罪，引起很大反响，说“中外公论，群起而非之”。朱孔彰《曾文正公别传》（《中兴将帅别传》卷一）虽竭力回护也无法把这一事件抹煞，只得指出“津民怨公”。就是为曾国藩捧场的小说《消闲演义》，也不得不写出天津人民竟因此“大哗”，都骂曾国藩“巴结洋鬼子”，“献媚洋人”“名誉大损”。这些，就迫使曾国藩不能不供认自己的行为是在“铸错”，所谓“内疚神明，外惭清议”，也即不敢完全按照帝国主义的意旨执行，以缓和人民对他的愤怒。至于写作诗歌论述这一回教案，对曾国藩进行指摘的，所见亦不少。流传最广的，有吴大廷《津门纪事诗》（《小酋膄山馆诗钞》三编卷下），他反对隐忍屈辱，说“世岂无韩（世忠）岳（飞），其如隐忍何？”指出帝国主义的贪婪狡狯本性：“他族惯要挟”，“夷情工反复”。但最表现了人民情绪的，却要推谢麘伯《南岳草堂稿》中的《庚午有感》
  （《雪青阁诗集》不载）：
          未必开边衅　求和杀匹夫
          甘心效魏绛　传首谢单于
          一掷愁孤注　中原失壮图
          伤哉五人墓　夜夜有啼乌
    这首诗反对开门揖盗，反对屈辱求和，反对偿命谢罪，反对杀害无辜，歌颂被杀害者为义士，矛头直指“魏绛”——汉奸刽子手曾国藩，卖国贼李鸿章等。
