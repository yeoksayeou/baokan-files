Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Albanian Ambassador to China, Parifti, held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight to warmly celebrate the glorious festival of the Albanian people – the 16th anniversary of the liberation of Albania.

Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Mao Zedong, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Premier of the State Council, Zhou Enlai, and Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhu De, attended the reception.

At six o'clock, Chairman Mao and other party and state leaders arrived at the reception hall, which was decorated with the national flags of China and Albania, and shook hands cordially with Ambassador Parifti, who was waiting at the entrance of the hall. At this moment, the band played the music of "The East is Red," and the Chinese and foreign guests attending the reception applauded warmly for a long time, and the hall suddenly presented a scene of jubilation and enthusiasm.

Ambassador Parifti and Premier Zhou Enlai delivered enthusiastic speeches at tonight's reception, in which they praised each other for the great achievements made by the people of China and Albania in socialist construction. Ambassador Parifti expressed heartfelt congratulations for the great, strong, and eternal friendship between the people of Albania and China, which has grown and developed on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Premier Zhou Enlai said at the reception that under any circumstances, the people of China and Albania will always hold high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism, support each other, encourage each other, learn from each other, and help each other.

Ambassador Parifti spoke first at the reception. He said that the Albanian people attach particular importance to celebrating their festival this year, because this year is the last year of our country's second five-year plan, and it is also the year when the Fourth Congress of the Party will be held.

The Ambassador said that under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have achieved great and brilliant results in peaceful and constructive labor. He said that in these sixteen years, Albania has changed from a backward agricultural country to an agricultural-industrial country. The new five-year plan to be adopted at the Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party to be held in December will be an important step in transforming our country into an industrial-agricultural country and strengthening the material and technical foundation of our socialism.

Speaking on international issues, Ambassador Parifti said that Albania has always pursued a consistent foreign policy of peace. The Ambassador said that at the same time, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian people will never weaken their revolutionary vigilance, but will instead double their vigilance. Because the enemies of the freedom and peace of all peoples, first and foremost the US imperialism, the number one enemy of all peoples today, and its tools in the Balkans, have not abandoned their bellicose and aggressive plans.

He emphasized: "The Albanian people will never be deceived by the sweet words and deceptive propaganda that imperialism sometimes uses because it is forced by the pressure of the people." He said, "'The wolf may change its fur, but not its nature.' This saying is completely consistent with imperialism and its nature."

Ambassador Parifti said that the Albanian Labor Party will always be loyal to Marxism-Leninism and will resolutely oppose all non-Marxist-Leninist tendencies, especially modern revisionism, and will regard this struggle as a primary internationalist task.

He also said that the Albanian people will always uphold and consolidate the friendship and unity of the fraternal peoples of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in the future, based on the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

When talking about the achievements of China's socialist construction, Ambassador Parifti pointed out that the achievements of the Chinese people are the fruits of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes of the Chinese Communist Party. He said enthusiastically that a great, strong, and unbreakable friendship links the Albanian people with the fraternal Chinese people, and this friendship is built on the basis of Marxist-Leninst thought and proletarian internationalism. The Albanian people are happy and proud to have such a great and faithful friend as the Chinese people.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the reception, and on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government, he extended the warmest heartfelt congratulations to the heroic Albanian people, the glorious Albanian Labor Party, and the government of the People's Republic of Albania.

He said that the Albanian people after liberation have waged a tenacious struggle for the prosperity of their motherland. Although Albania is surrounded by capitalist countries, and imperialism and the Yugoslavian Tito clique have never stopped their subversion and sabotage activities against Albania, the Albanian people have never succumbed to any pressure, nor have they bowed their heads to any difficulties. They have always been closely united around the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, adhered to the socialist revolution, and victoriously carried out socialist construction. Premier Zhou said, "The revolutionary heroic spirit of the Albanian people, who are not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of violence, firm and unyielding, and bravely advancing, is praised and admired by the Chinese people and progressive mankind all over the world."

Premier Zhou enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements made by the Albanian people in socialist construction under extremely difficult conditions. He said that all of this "not only eloquently proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, but also vividly demonstrates to the people of the world the truth that as long as there is correct leadership from a Marxist-Leninist party, as long as the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people is fully developed, and as long as the whole party and the whole people are of one heart and one mind and work hard, they will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and turn the great ideal of building socialism into a living reality."

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Albanian government and people have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and have always stood firmly at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace, making outstanding contributions to the cause of defending world peace and promoting human progress.

He said: "The glorious Albanian Labor Party is a fighting Marxist-Leninist party tempered in the heat of revolutionary struggle, a party that has flesh-and-blood ties with the masses of the people, and a strong force in the international communist movement. It has always been loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, adhered to the position of the Moscow Declaration, carried out an irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique, and made significant contributions to safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism and to strengthening the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the international communist moment. The Chinese Communists deeply admire the Albanian Labor Party's high degree of principled spirit of Marxism-Leninism and its tenacious fighting spirit, and the Chinese Communist Party is proud to have such a strong comrade-in-arms as the Albanian Labor Party."

When talking about the friendship between the people of China and Albania, Premier Zhou emphasized: "The Chinese people have always received strong support from the Albanian people, whether in socialist construction, in the struggle against US imperialist aggression and in defense of sovereignty and territorial integrity, or in the struggle to restore China's legitimate rights in the United Nations."

Premier Zhou pointed out: "When US imperialism and its followers launched a campaign to slander and isolate China all over the world for ulterior motives, the Albanian people stepped forward, ruthlessly exposed the enemy's shameful conspiracy, and powerfully shattered the enemy's slander and attacks." He said that the Chinese people express their heartfelt thanks for the Albanian people's great proletarian internationalist spirit and their wholehearted support for the just position of the Chinese people.

Premier Zhou finally said that there are inevitably some difficulties and twists and turns on our road forward, but we believe that under any circumstances, the people of our two countries will always hold high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism, support each other, encourage each other, learn from each other, and help each other, and struggle to the end to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp and to win the final victory of our common cause.

After Ambassador Parifti and Premier Zhou Enlai spoke, the band played the solemn national anthems of China and Albania respectively. Their friendly speeches aroused bursts of warm applause in the hall.

Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast at the reception. He proposed a toast to the heroic Albanian people for achieving even more brilliant achievements in socialist construction, and to the health of Ambassador Parifti.

Today's reception was filled with a very warm and brotherly atmosphere. Hundreds of guests frequently raised their glasses to congratulate the Albanian people on their brilliant achievements, to congratulate the development of the close fraternal friendship between the people of China and Albania, and to congratulate the strengthening of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Other party and state leaders who attended the reception included members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee Chen Boda, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, and Lin Feng, and Vice-Premiers of the State Council Luo Ruiqing and Xi Zhongxun.

    毛泽东主席等党和国家领导人出席阿尔巴尼亚使馆国庆招待会
    帕里夫蒂大使说，阿劳动党永远忠于马克思列宁主义，坚决反对现代修正主义
    周总理说，中阿两国人民将永远高举革命的红旗，互相支持互相学习互相帮助
    新华社29日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使帕里夫蒂今晚在北京饭店举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民的光荣节日——阿尔巴尼亚解放十六周年。
    中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东，中国共产党中央委员会副主席、国务院总理周恩来，中国共产党中央委员会副主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德出席了招待会。
    六时，毛主席等党和国家领导人来到悬挂着中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国国旗的招待会大厅，和迎候在大厅门口的帕里夫蒂大使亲切握手。这时，乐队高奏“东方红”乐曲，出席招待会的中外人士长时间地热烈鼓掌，大厅里顿时呈现出一片欢腾和热烈的气氛。
    帕里夫蒂大使和周恩来总理在今晚的招待会上，发表了热情的讲话，他们互相赞扬了中阿两国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就。帕里夫蒂大使为在马列主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上成长和发展起来的阿中两国人民之间的伟大的、坚强的、永恒的友谊，表示衷心的祝贺。周恩来总理在招待会上说，在任何情况下，中阿两国人民都将永远高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，互相支持，互相鼓舞，互相学习，互相帮助。
    帕里夫蒂大使在招待会上首先讲话。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民今年特别重视庆祝自己的节日，因为今年是我国第二个五年计划的最后一年，也是党的第四次代表大会将要召开的一年。
    大使说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在和平和建设性的劳动中获得了伟大而光辉的成果。他说，在这十六年内，阿尔巴尼亚已从一个落后的农业国变成了一个农业—工业国。将在12月召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会上通过的新五年计划，将是把我国变成一个工业—农业国以及加强我国社会主义物质技术基础中的一个重要步骤。
    在谈到国际问题时，帕里夫蒂大使说，阿尔巴尼亚始终不渝地奉行和平外交政策。大使说，与此同时，阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，决不削弱革命的警惕性，相反要加倍地警惕。因为各国人民自由与和平的敌人，首先是当前各国人民头号敌人的美帝国主义及其在巴尔干的工具，并未放弃他们的好战和侵略的计划。
    他强调指出：“阿尔巴尼亚人民决不为帝国主义由于在人民的压力下有时被迫而使用的花言巧语和欺骗宣传所迷惑。”他说，“‘狼毛可换，狼皮不变’。这句话完全符合帝国主义和它的本性。”
    帕里夫蒂大使说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党要永远忠于马克思列宁主义，并将坚决反对一切非马克思列宁主义的倾向，特别是反对现代修正主义，并把这一斗争看成是一项首要的国际主义的任务。
    他还说，阿尔巴尼亚人民将永远依据马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的不朽原则，在今后要进一步维护和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营兄弟人民的友谊和团结。
    帕里夫蒂大使谈到中国社会主义建设的成就时指出，中国人民的成就是中国共产党总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的果实。他热情地说，伟大的、坚强的、牢不可破的友谊把阿尔巴尼亚人民和兄弟的中国人民联系在一起，这一友谊是建筑在马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义基础之上的。阿尔巴尼亚人民为有中国人民这样一个伟大的忠诚的朋友而高兴和自豪。
    周恩来总理在招待会上讲话，他代表中国人民、中国共产党和中国政府，向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民、光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，致以最热烈的衷心的祝贺。
    他说，解放以后的阿尔巴尼亚人民，为祖国的繁荣和富强进行了顽强的斗争。尽管阿尔巴尼亚处在资本主义国家的包围之中，帝国主义和南斯拉夫铁托集团一天也没有停止过对阿尔巴尼亚的颠复和破坏活动，但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民决不在任何压力面前屈服，决不对任何困难低头，他们始终紧密地团结在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志的周围，坚持了社会主义革命，胜利地进行着社会主义建设。周总理说，“阿尔巴尼亚人民这种不怕困难、不畏强暴、坚贞不屈、奋勇前进的革命英雄气概，受到中国人民和全世界进步人类的赞扬和敬佩。”
    周总理热情地赞扬了阿尔巴尼亚人民在极端困难的条件下，在社会主义建设方面所取得的光辉成就。他说，这一切“不仅雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性，而且生动地向全世界人民说明了这样一个真理：只要有了马克思列宁主义政党的正确领导，只要充分地发扬广大人民群众的革命干劲，只要全党全民，同心同德，艰苦奋斗，那么，就一定能够战胜一切困难，把建设社会主义的伟大理想变成活生生的现实。”
    周恩来总理说，阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民一贯奉行和平外交政策，始终坚定地站在反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的斗争的最前线，对保卫世界和平、促进人类进步的事业作出了卓越的贡献。
    他说：“光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，是在火热的革命斗争中锻炼出来的战斗的马克思列宁主义的党，是同人民群众有血肉联系的党，是国际共产主义运动中的一支坚强力量。它一贯忠实于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则，坚持莫斯科宣言的立场，同以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义进行着毫不调和的斗争，对保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，对加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的伟大团结作出了重大的贡献。中国共产党人十分敬佩阿尔巴尼亚劳动党这种马克思列宁主义的高度原则精神和顽强的战斗精神，中国共产党为有阿尔巴尼亚劳动党这样一个坚强的战友而感到自豪。”
    周总理在谈到中阿两国人民的友谊时强调说：“中国人民不论是在社会主义建设中，在反对美帝国主义侵略、维护主权和领土完整的斗争中，在恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的斗争中，都一向得到阿尔巴尼亚人民的有力支持。”
    周总理指出：“当美帝国主义和它的追随者为了不可告人的目的，在全世界掀起了诽谤和孤立中国的运动的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民挺身而出，无情地戳穿了敌人的可耻阴谋，有力地击破了敌人的造谣中伤。”他说，中国人民对于阿尔巴尼亚人民这种伟大的无产阶级国际主义精神和对中国人民正义立场的全心全意的支持，表示衷心的感谢。
    周总理最后说，在我们前进的道路上不可避免地还存在着一些困难和曲折，但是我们相信，在任何情况下，我们两国人民都将永远高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，互相支持，互相鼓舞，互相学习，互相帮助，为加强社会主义阵营的团结、为争取我们共同事业的最后胜利而奋斗到底。
    帕里夫蒂大使和周恩来总理讲话以后，乐队分别奏起庄严的中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国的国歌。他们的充满友情的讲话，在会场上激起一阵又一阵热烈的鼓掌声。
    陈毅副总理在招待会上祝酒。他提议为英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义建设中取得更加辉煌的成就，为帕里夫蒂大使的健康，干杯。
