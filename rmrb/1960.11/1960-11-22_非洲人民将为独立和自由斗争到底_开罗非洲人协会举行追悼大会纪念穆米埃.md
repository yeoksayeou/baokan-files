    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 19th—The African Association in Cairo held a memorial service here tonight for Félix Moumié, the Cameroonian nationalist leader who was recently poisoned by imperialists in Geneva. Attendees unanimously condemned the shameless means of imperialism and expressed their determination to strengthen their struggle for freedom and independence.
    The representative of the Cameroonian Office in Cairo said that imperialism believes that killing Moumié will extinguish the torch of freedom; however, this will never happen.
    The representative of the Ugandan Office in Cairo said at the meeting that Moumié was poisoned to death by imperialism, and he worked day and night for the freedom and independence of Africa during his lifetime. He added: "We must never abandon the principles of freedom and independence, and nothing can stop our mighty struggle."
    Representatives of West African students here condemned imperialism for using vile and shameless means to continue clinging to Africa, and said that imperialists plunder Africa's resources and practice colonial rule over the peoples of African countries.
    The representative of the Southern Rhodesian Office in Cairo said that we should join hands and unite to drive imperialism out of Africa. The representative of Northern Rhodesia in Cairo said that the United Nations' current actions in the Congo, like its past actions in Cameroon, aim to prevent the people from enjoying their rights.

    非洲人民将为独立和自由斗争到底
    开罗非洲人协会举行追悼大会纪念穆米埃
    新华社开罗19日电　开罗的非洲人协会19日晚上在这里为最近在日内瓦被帝国主义者毒害的喀麦隆民族主义领袖费利克斯·穆米埃举行追悼大会，与会者一致谴责帝国主义的无耻手段，并且表示将加强他们为争取自由和独立的斗争。
    喀麦隆驻开罗办事处代表说，帝国主义认为，杀害了穆米埃将会熄灭自由的火炬；但是，决不会发生这样的事情。
    乌干达驻开罗办事处代表在会上讲话说，穆米埃是被帝国主义毒害死的，他生前夜以继日地为非洲的自由和独立而斗争。他又说：“我们决不能放弃自由和独立的原则，任何东西都阻挡不了我们的声势浩大的斗争。”
    这里的西非学生代表谴责帝国主义为了继续盘踞在非洲而使用卑鄙无耻的手段，并且说，帝国主义者掠夺非洲的资源并对非洲各国人民实行殖民统治。
    南罗得西亚驻开罗办事处代表说，我们应该携手团结起来把帝国主义赶出非洲。北罗得西亚驻开罗代表说，联合国目前在刚果的行动就像过去在喀麦隆的行动一样，其目的在于不让人民享有自己的权利。
