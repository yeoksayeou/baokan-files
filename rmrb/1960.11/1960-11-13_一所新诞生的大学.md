新疆通讯：A Newly Born University
By Our Correspondent Tan Feng

    A new and vast complex of buildings has appeared at the foot of the Carp Mountain in the western suburbs of Urumqi. Groups of young men and women in colorful national costumes are living happy student lives here. This is Xinjiang University, Xinjiang's first comprehensive university. More than a thousand students of various ethnic minorities such as Uyghur, Kazakh, Kirgiz, Tatar, and Han from all over the Tianshan Mountains, have gathered together, and under the sunshine of the Party's ethnic policies, they have begun a happy learning life.

    Farm Girl Becomes a University Student

    Before liberation, the farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang lived in hunger and cold under the oppression of reactionary rule, and were completely deprived of the right to education. After liberation, with the Party's close care, minority education was vigorously developed, and schools at all levels were established in agricultural and pastoral areas. The emancipated farmers and herdsmen happily sent their children to school to study. Most of the ethnic minority students studying at Xinjiang University are children of poor farmers and herdsmen from the past. Twenty-two-year-old Uyghur girl Patigulu is the daughter of a farm laborer from the Ili River. Before liberation, her father worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord. After a year of hard work, the family barely had enough to eat, let alone money to send their children to school. Little Patigulu was very envious when she saw the children of wealthy people going to school. Later, her family sent her to school, but she was only able to study until the third grade, and was forced to drop out due to not being able to pay the tuition. In 1949, she was liberated, her family was allocated land, and she no longer had to worry about food and clothing. Patigulu was able to resume her studies. After graduating from high school, because of her excellent grades, she was recommended to study at Xinjiang College, and her food and clothing were subsidized by the state. Now, Patigulu is a third-year student in the Mathematics Department. She is diligent in her studies and gets mostly fours and fives in all her subjects, and has honorably joined the Party. Kazakh youth Tasiken is the son of a shepherd from Habahan County in the Altai Mountains. As a child, he followed his parents to herd sheep for the landlord, running around in the mountains with the livestock all year round. He spent his days with lambs and foals, and didn't even know what "school" meant. The Communist Party brought a happy life to the remote grasslands. Tasiken went from primary school to middle school, and is now an excellent student in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at Xinjiang University. He excitedly said: "In the past, it was not easy to find a primary school student in my hometown, but now there are about twenty Kazakh youths from Habahan County alone studying in various subjects at Xinjiang University. It's a truly earth-shattering change!"

    Growth of Ethnic Minority Teachers

    In the fifteen majors at Xinjiang University, every course is taught by ethnic minority teachers. Of the more than 290 teaching staff in the university, teachers from seven ethnic minorities, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Kirgiz, and Tatar, account for more than half. Their average age is only in their twenties, and they are all the first generation of higher education teachers in Xinjiang, who have grown up under the Party's cultivation after liberation. Haziken, deputy director of the Department of History and Geography at Xinjiang University, who studied at the former Xinjiang College, said: "Only the great Communist Party came and enabled us to turn over culturally. The Kuomintang reactionaries destroyed ethnic cultural and educational undertakings. Although Xinjiang College has a history of twenty-six years, there was not a single ethnic minority teacher before liberation. Now Xinjiang University has so many ethnic minority teachers, and every ethnic minority teacher embodies the Party's concern for education in ethnic minority areas.

    Ethnic minority teachers of the Department of Mathematics and Physics, Mutagofu and Amir, etc., graduated from Xinjiang College only in 1955 and 1956. At that time, they were only at the level of junior college graduates, and when they first came to the Department of Mathematics and Physics as teachers, they had many difficulties. They had not even studied some of the courses themselves. Chen Dehuang, director of the Mathematics Analysis Teaching and Research Section, and other veteran Han teachers enthusiastically came to help them. When classes started, the Han teachers treated the ethnic minority teachers' courses as their own. From compiling textbooks, finding materials, to writing lectures, they taught them hand in hand. At that time, there were no Uyghur textbooks, so Chen Dehuang helped them compile the textbooks. When the ethnic minority teachers couldn't understand the Chinese text, he sacrificed his rest time to help them translate it into Uyghur. Where they couldn't understand something, he helped them explain it through gestures and objects. With the hard work of Chen Dehuang and other Han teachers, these ethnic minority teachers were soon able to take the stage and lecture. Atjeuv, 28, was just an ordinary middle school student at the beginning of liberation, and is now an excellent Uzbek teacher at Xinjiang University, serving as the deputy director of the Department of Biochemistry. Whenever he talks about his extraordinary learning process, Atjeuv is always filled with emotion: "Everything I have is given by the Party, and every bit of progress is inseparable from the help of Han comrades." After graduating from Xinjiang College in 1953, in order to train him, the Party sent him and seven other ethnic minority comrades to Beijing Normal University to study. Atjeuv was both excited and worried. He was excited to have the opportunity to study at a nationally renowned university, but worried that his Chinese proficiency was low and he couldn't understand the lectures. When they arrived at the Normal University, in order to enable them to master Chinese as soon as possible, the university party committee specially designated teachers to give them after-school tutoring, and selected excellent Han students to attend classes with them, live in the same dormitory, and help them anytime and anywhere. Weng Kemin, a Han student who was inseparable from Atjeuv, became his most unforgettable friend. Atjeuv learned the Chinese words "sugar", "lie down", and "soup" for a long time, but could never distinguish them. Weng Kemin used objects and image explanation methods to help Atjeuv understand the meaning of the words. With the help of Han teachers and Weng Kemin, Atjeuv successfully completed his studies.

    A Family of Ethnic Friendship

    Walking into the gate of Xinjiang University, one can see moving scenes of unity and friendship between students and teachers of all ethnic groups. When groups of students simultaneously speaking Uyghur, Kazakh, and Chinese pass by me, it is almost impossible to distinguish who is Uyghur and who is Han. Teachers and students of all ethnic groups respect and love each other, are as close as brothers and sisters, and live in a united and harmonious big family. The Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic minority students in the fourth grade of the Department of Mathematics and Physics and the Han students in the teacher training class are well-known models of good unity throughout the university, and people call them the "brother class." In January of this year, in order to strengthen each other's ties and learn each other's languages, the students of the two classes automatically broke the boundaries between classes. Ethnic minority students and Han students lived together in the same dormitory, spending time together day and night, and enhancing friendship. Han students Yuan Yongde and Ma Baogeng lived with Kazakh students Nurburak and Ahedera. Yuan Yongde is from Hutubi County in Xinjiang, and Ma Baogeng is from Jiangnan. The two Kazakh students had never left the Altai grasslands before. Their living habits were different and their languages were not mutually intelligible. At first, everyone was very restrained, but after a few days, they became as close as family members, giving each other stationery and helping each other with homework. In order to help Nurburak and Ahedera learn Chinese, Yuan Yongde and Ma Baogeng posted strips of paper written in Chinese on the walls, tables, chair backs, and mirrors, and taught the ethnic minority students to pronounce them every night. They also learned Uyghur, and quickly eliminated the language barriers between them.

    Today, this newly born Xinjiang University, under the leadership of the Party, is striding forward, cultivating a group of outstanding ethnic minority children for the motherland. (Attached Picture)

    一所新诞生的大学
    本报记者　谈风
    在乌鲁木齐市西郊鲤鱼山下，出现了一座新的巨大建筑群。一群群穿着各色民族服装的青年男女，在这里过着愉快的学习生活。这就是刚诞生的新疆第一所综合大学——新疆大学。来自天山南北的一千多名维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、塔塔尔等各少数民族和祖国各地的汉族学生，齐聚一堂，在党的民族政策的阳光照耀下，开始了幸福的学习生活。
    农家姑娘成了大学生
    解放前，新疆各族农牧民在反动统治压榨下，过着饥寒交迫的生活，根本被剥夺了受教育的权利。解放后，在党的亲切关怀下，大力发展少数民族教育事业，在农牧区兴办各级学校。翻了身的农牧民，兴高采烈地把孩子送进学校学习。在新疆大学学习的各民族学生，大部分是过去贫苦农牧民的子女。二十二岁的维吾尔族姑娘帕提古鲁，是伊犁河畔一个雇农的女儿。解放前，父亲给地主当长工，辛苦一年，一家人还糊不上口，那里有钱供孩子上学。小帕提古鲁看到有钱人的孩子上学非常羡慕。后来，家里送她上学，勉强读到三年级，终因交不上学费被停了学。1949年解放了，她家分了土地，再不为吃穿发愁了，帕提古鲁才复了学。高中毕业后，由于她成绩优异，被保送到新疆学院学习，衣食都由国家补助。现在，帕提古鲁已经是数学系三年级的学生。她勤奋好学，各门功课都是四分、五分，并且光荣地参加了党。哈萨克族青年塔西肯是阿尔泰山区哈巴河县一个牧羊人的儿子，小时候就跟着父母给地主放羊，终年随着牲畜奔走在山区，整天和羊羔、马驹在一起，连什么叫“学校”都不知道。共产党给偏远的草原带来了幸福的生活，塔西肯从小学念到中学，现在成了新疆大学数理系的优秀学生。他兴奋地说：“过去在家乡找个小学生都不容易，现在光在新疆大学就有二十名左右哈巴河县的哈萨克族青年在各科学习，真是翻天复地的大变化！”
    少数民族教师的成长
    在新疆大学的十五个专业中，每一门课程都有少数民族教师任教。全校二百九十余名教学人员中，维吾尔、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、塔塔尔等七个少数民族的教师就占到了一半多，他们的平均年龄不过二十几岁，都是解放后在党的培养下成长起来的，是新疆第一代高等学校的教师。曾在原新疆学院读过书的新疆大学史地系副主任哈孜肯说：“只有伟大的共产党来了，才使我们在文化上翻了身。国民党反动派摧残民族文化教育事业，新疆学院虽有二十六年的历史，但解放前连一个民族教师都没有。现在新疆大学有这么多的民族教师，每一个民族教师身上都凝结着党对民族地区教育的关怀。
    数理系民族教师木他果甫、阿米尔等都是1955年和1956年才从新疆学院毕业的。当时他们只有专科学校毕业的水平，初到数理系担任教师时困难很多，有些课程他们自己也没学过。数学分析教研室主任陈德璜和其他汉族老教师热情地来帮助他们。开课时，汉族教师把民族教师的课程当作自己的课程，从编教材、找资料到写讲稿，都执手相教。当时没有维文教材，陈德璜便帮他们编好教材，民族教师看不懂汉文，他便牺牲休息时间帮助他们翻译成维文。说不通的地方，通过用手势、实物来帮助说明。在陈德璜等汉族教师的辛勤帮助下，这些民族教师很快就能登台讲课了。二十八岁的阿捷尤夫解放初还是一个普通中学生，现在成了新疆大学优秀的乌孜别克族教师，担任着生化系的副主任。一谈起他这段不平凡的学习过程，阿捷尤夫总是充满深情地说：“我的一切都是党给的，每一点进步都离不开汉族同志的帮助。”1953年，他在新疆学院毕业后，党为了培养他，送他和另外七个民族同志到北京师范大学学习。阿捷尤夫又是兴奋，又是耽心，兴奋的是有机会到全国有名的大学学习，耽心的是自己汉文水平低，听不懂课。当他们到了师大之后，学校党委为了使他们尽快掌握汉语，专门指定教师给他们做业余辅导，挑选了优秀的汉族同学，和他们同桌听课，同舍住宿，随时随地帮助他们。和阿捷尤夫行坐不离的汉族学生翁克敏成了他最难忘的朋友。阿捷尤夫对汉语中的“糖”、“躺”、“汤”学了很久，总是分不清楚，翁克敏就采用实物、形象讲解法，帮助阿捷尤夫理解字意。阿捷尤夫在汉族老师和翁克敏的帮助下，胜利完成了学习任务。
    民族友爱的家庭
    走进新疆大学的校门，到处可以看到各民族学生之间和教师之间团结友爱的动人景象，当一群群同时用维吾尔语、哈萨克语和汉族语互相交谈的学生，从我身边走过时，简直分不清谁是维吾尔族，谁是汉族。各民族师生互敬互爱，亲如手足，生活在一个团结和睦的大家庭里。数理系四年级的维、哈等民族学生和师资训练班的汉族学生，是全校有名的团结好的模范，人们称他们为“兄弟班”。今年1月间，为了加强彼此的联系，互相学习语言，两班的学生自动打破了班界，民族学生与汉族学生混住宿舍，朝夕相处，增进友谊。汉族学生袁永德、马宝更和哈萨克族的努尔布拉克、阿合德拉住在一起。袁永德是新疆呼图壁县人，马宝更来自江南，两个哈萨克同学过去没离开过阿勒泰草原，生活习惯不同，语言不通，开头大家很拘束，但是没过几天之后他们就亲热的像一家人了，互相赠送文具、帮助温课。为了帮助努尔布拉克和阿合德拉学汉语，袁永德和马宝更在墙上、桌边、椅背以及镜子上都贴上了用汉文写的纸条，每天晚上教民族同学读音，自己也学会了维语，很快就扫除了彼此语言上的障碍。
    今天，这所新诞生的新疆大学，在党的领导下，正阔步向前迈进，为祖国培育着一批优秀的民族儿女。（附图片）
