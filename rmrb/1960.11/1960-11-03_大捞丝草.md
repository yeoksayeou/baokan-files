    Mass Collection of Pondweed

    Pondweed is a good fertilizer and one of the main sources of fertilizer in lake areas. Our Ya Zi Gang Commune's Quan Hu Brigade has seven large and small lakes rich in pondweed. This year, the brigade's Party General Branch summarized the experience of Dong Hong Production Team last year, which achieved increased production by covering winter wheat with pondweed after sowing. It mobilized commune members to collect pondweed to make fertilizer. It is estimated that the entire team can collect 500,000 dan of pondweed. In addition to ensuring that each mu of the 5,450 mu of winter crops can be fertilized with 50 dan, it can also store 220,000 dan of fertilizer for next year's "Three Early" crops. In order to seize the current favorable opportunity, the brigade organized a professional pondweed collection and fertilizer accumulation team. Under the leadership of the Party General Branch Secretary, 103 boats were dispatched to collect pondweed in a large scale by dividing the lakes and sections. A responsibility system was also established that fixed work efficiency, quality, time, and work points, and a fertilizer accumulation competition was launched.
    This production team has now accumulated 326 piles of mixed fertilizer.

    大捞丝草
    丝草是一种好肥料，是湖区肥料主要来源之一。我们鸭子港公社全护大队有盛产丝草的大小湖面七处。今年大队党总支总结了去年东红生产队在冬小麦播种后复盖丝草获得增产的经验，发动社员大捞丝草制肥，预计全队可捞丝草五十万担，除了保证五千四百五十亩冬种作物每亩可施肥五十担以外，还可以为明年“三早”作物贮备肥料二十二万担。为了抓住当前有利时机，大队组织了捞丝草积肥专业队，在党总支书记领导下，出动了一百零三只船，采取分湖、分段的办法大捞丝草，还制订了定工效、定质量、定时间、定工分的责任制，开展了积肥竞赛。
    这个生产队现已堆制了三百二十六堆混合肥。
