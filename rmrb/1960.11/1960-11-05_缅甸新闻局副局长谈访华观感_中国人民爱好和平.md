Deputy Director of the Burmese News Bureau Discusses Impressions of Visiting China
The Chinese People Love Peace

Wu Kin, Deputy Director of the Burmese News Bureau and head of the Burmese News Delegation, who recently returned from a visit to China, said, "The Chinese people are the most hardworking, brave, and peace-loving people in the world."

Wu Kin made these remarks during an exclusive interview with a Xinhua News Agency reporter. He said: All the people in China, from top to bottom, are working hard for the peaceful construction and prosperity of their motherland. Wu Kin also said: There is no war-mongering atmosphere in China.

Wu Kin said that today, China has made tremendous achievements in socialist construction. China has not only achieved unprecedented development in industrial and agricultural production, but also made great progress in culture based on the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new."

Wu Kin said that the news delegation visited the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project. There, they saw the Chinese people fighting against natural disasters. He believes that after the completion of this project, the historically harmful Yellow River will become a green river, a river that benefits the people. He said that this is a historical miracle.

Wu Kin said that they were very interested in the people's communes in urban and rural areas during their stay in China. He emphasized that they saw the great achievements made by the people's communes in production. Every person and every family is living a happy life with ample food and clothing. There is no such thing as "forced labor" and "family separation" in China at all.

Wu Kin continued: Facts have proven that the people's commune is a progressive organization, and it fully demonstrates its power in developing production and improving society.

    各国舆论赞扬我国人民热爱和平
    缅甸新闻局副局长谈访华观感
    中国人民爱好和平
    最近从中国访问回国的缅甸新闻局副局长、缅甸新闻代表团团长吴钦说：“中国人民是世界上最勤劳勇敢和爱好和平的人民”。
    吴钦是在单独接见新华社记者时说这番话的。他说：全中国的人民自上至下都在为自己祖国的和平建设和繁荣而努力。吴钦又说：在中国没有好战气氛。
    吴钦说，今天，中国已经在社会主义建设方面取得了巨大的成就。中国不仅在工农业生产方面有了史无前例的发展，而且根据“百花齐放，推陈出新”的政策在文化方面也取得了巨大的进步。
    吴钦说，新闻代表团参观了三门峡水利工程。他们在那里看到中国人民同自然灾害作斗争的情景。他认为，在这个工程建成之后，历史上为害的黄河将变成绿河，变成造福之河。他说，这是历史上的奇迹。
    吴钦说，他们在中国逗留期间对城乡人民公社极感兴趣。他强调说，他们看到人民公社在生产方面取得了巨大的成就。每个人和每个家庭都过着丰衣足食的幸福生活。在中国根本没有“强迫劳动”和“家庭分离”的事情。
    吴钦接着说：事实证明人民公社是一种进步的组织，它在发展生产和改进社会方面充分显示出它的威力。
