	Laboring and Creating in "Beidahuang"
	Zhang Zuoliang
	It is a great honor for all the art workers in the reclamation area to be able to exhibit some of our works created during the arduous reclamation labor over the past two years in Beijing. We are art workers fighting on the agricultural front of "Beidahuang".
	Our most important experience in participating in labor and creation is this: First, listen to the Party. Wherever the Party wants us to fight in the construction of the reclamation area, we will go there to fight; whatever the Party wants us to paint, we will paint. In early 1958, when our army art workers were transferred to Beidahuang, everyone was assigned to newly built farms, ranches, and forest farms. At that time, it was the sowing season when "every moment of spring sowing is worth a thousand gold pieces." We built *ma jia* (i.e., grass sheds) to settle down, and immediately threw ourselves into the battle of rush-planting soybeans. Under the organization of the farm Party committee, several of us art workers participated in labor while carrying our painting tools to the production points with the most arduous battles to do political propaganda. We used all forms of art propaganda in a simple way, such as painting field propaganda boards, hoe poems and paintings, comic strips, organizing art galleries, making slides, pulling foreign films..., publicizing good people and good deeds, and publicizing the arduous struggle spirit of Nanniwan reclamation. At that time, as long as there was an art gallery in the "open-air club" in the field, it would be crowded with people during rest. Through a series of propaganda activities, we gloriously completed the propaganda tasks assigned to us by the Party, and at the same time, we laid the foundation for future creation in the tense labor and art activities, feeling very at ease in our hearts. The reason is that we have clarified the Party's requirements for us, familiarized ourselves with the new environment, and familiarized ourselves with the masses and the common cause we are engaged in. At this time, some woodcuts with themes such as settling down, developing production, and learning agricultural knowledge appeared in the creation, such as "Going to Beidahuang" (Chao Mei, Zuoliang), "Settling Down in Beidahuang" (Xu Leng), "Rush Planting", and "The First Footprint" (Chao Mei). Once these works were published and posted, they played a great role in encouraging the transferred soldiers and consolidating their confidence in the construction of the reclamation area. Take my production team as an example. Through a series of propaganda activities, the daily manual planting of soybeans increased from 2 mu to 3 mu, 5 mu, and even 14 or 15 mu. The entire farm overfulfilled the first spring sowing task 15 days ahead of schedule.
	The second reason for achieving success is to go deep into life. It is not enough to settle down among the masses, but also to constantly transform one's own thinking in the struggle of labor so that it is consistent with the thoughts and feelings of the masses. Only in this way can we reflect the fiery struggle life, the aspirations and interests of the masses. In the winter of 1958, in order to meet the needs of the country's high-speed construction and the continuous leap forward of agriculture in the reclamation area in 1959, all the transferred soldiers in the reclamation area were divided into two groups to go up the mountains to cut trees and go down to the fields to drain water. In the severe winter with three feet of ice, we art workers carried saws, axes, hoes, and painting tools, shuttling back and forth in the primeval forests and grasslands to labor, sketching in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. Our hands were so frozen that we couldn't hold the pen, but we still gritted our teeth and painted. At night, we carved woodcuts and painted propaganda paintings under the dim candlelight. The art workers of Beidahuang studied the tenacious spirit of the heroes in this way and carried out art propaganda activities. At that time, in the Wandashan Mountains stretching for hundreds of miles, or on the vast grasslands, as long as there was a battle, there were the woodcuts we carved or the large-scale oil paintings and propaganda paintings we painted, standing in the construction site against the biting cold wind, adding color to the white grassland. If someone asks us: Why do we have such enthusiasm? To be honest, heroic figures and moving deeds constantly emerge in life, filling our eyes. This gives us a strong desire to create and makes us feel that we must express them. Sometimes we are so excited by the lively scenes of labor during the day that we can't sleep. For example, the color woodcuts such as "Morning in Wandashan" (Chao Mei), "Transporting Wood Out of the Mountains" (Liu Luosheng), and "Light Cavalry in the Forest" (Xu Leng) are expressions of the battle life at minus 30 degrees Celsius. The art workers of Beidahuang not only won the praise of their comrades with their works but also with their tenacious labor. They are very willing to ask us to compile and draw what they have seen, such as the comic strips "Hero Dian" and "Yanwo Island" (Zuoliang), which were drawn under such circumstances. Many other works were created under bonfires in the wild, with the initial drafts being criticized by the comrades. It vividly embodies the spirit of collectivism. Sometimes the production tasks are heavy, and we don't have time to paint. The workers take the initiative to take over our production tasks so that we can concentrate on creating.
	In the past two years of labor and creation, we have deeply felt that if an art worker can breathe and work together with the masses in the fiery struggle, our brushes will never run out of ink. This fully proves the brilliance of Chairman Mao's instruction that art workers should wholeheartedly go deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers and transform their thinking; at the same time, it more forcefully refutes the slander that "letting art workers go to the countryside to work and train is a waste of talent." If we, all the art workers, did not have the guidance of the Party and Mao Zedong's literary and art direction, and without the long-term class education and art education in the army, we would not be able to complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party. In the future, we must live steadfastly on the front lines of the agricultural battle, listen to the Party, follow the art path pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao, and be a veritable worker and a veritable art worker.

    在“北大荒”劳动和创作
    张作良
    我们——战斗在“北大荒”农业战线上的美术工作者，今天能将两年来在艰苦的垦荒劳动中创作出来的一些作品，拿到北京展出，实在是垦区全体美术工作者的光荣。
    我们在参加劳动和创作中所得到的一点成绩的体会，最重要的还在于：第一，听党的话。在垦区的建设里，党要我们到哪里去战斗，就到哪里去战斗；党要我们画什么，就画什么。1958年初，当我们部队美术工作者转业到北大荒后，大家都被分配在各初建的农场、牧场、林场里。当时正是“春播一刻值千金”的播种期。我们搭了马架
  （即草棚）安下家，立即投入抢播大豆的战斗。我们几个美术工作者在场党委组织下，一边参加劳动，一边背了画具到战斗最艰苦的生产点作政治宣传工作。我们因陋就简地利用一切美术宣传形式，如画地头宣传牌，锄头诗画，连环画，组织画廊，编幻灯，拉洋片……，宣传好人好事，宣传南泥湾屯垦的苦战精神。那时只要地头“露天俱乐部”里有画廊，一到休息就门庭若市挤满了人，通过一系列的宣传活动，我们光荣地完成了党交给的宣传任务，同时也在紧张的劳动和美术活动中为今后创作打下了基础，感到心里很踏实。原因是我们已明确了党对我们的要求，熟悉了新的环境，熟悉了群众和我们所从事的共同事业。这时在创作中就出现了一些属于安营扎寨，开荒生产，学习农业知识等题材的木刻，例如《到北大荒去》（晁楣、作良），《在北大荒安家》（徐楞），《抢播》、《第一道脚印》（晁楣）。这些作品一经出版张贴，对转业军人起到了极大的鼓舞作用，巩固了他们对垦区建设事业的信心。就拿我所在的生产队说，通过一系列宣传活动，使得人工点播大豆由日点二亩上升到三亩、五亩一直到十四、五亩，全场提前十五天超额完成第一次春播任务。
    取得成绩的第二个原因是深入生活。光在群众中落户还不够，还要在劳动斗争中时刻改造自己的思想，使它和群众的思想感情相一致。只有这样，才能把火热的斗争生活、群众的愿望、志趣，反映出来。1958年冬天，为了国家高速度的建设需要和1959年垦区农业持续跃进，垦区全体转业军人兵分二路上山伐木，下地排水。在冰封三尺的严冬里，我们美术工作者背着锯斧镐锹，刀笔画具，辗转在原始森林和草原上劳动，冒着零下三十度严寒写生，手冻得失去知觉握不住笔还是咬着牙画，晚上就在微弱的烛光下刻木刻画宣传画。北大荒的美术工作者就是这样学习着英雄们的顽强精神进行美术宣传活动。那时，在连绵数百里的完达山，或者在茫茫无际的草原，只要有战斗，就有我们刻的木刻或画的巨幅油画、宣传画，顶着凛冽寒风屹立在工地上，为白皑皑的草原增添色彩。如果有人问我们：为什么有这样的干劲？说真的，生活里英雄人物、动人的事迹时刻涌现，充塞眼帘。使我们产生强烈的创作欲望，觉得我们非去表现他们不可。有时给白天劳动欢跃的场面激动得睡不着觉，例如《完达山的早晨》（晁楣），《运木出山》（刘洛生），《林海轻骑》（徐楞）等套色木刻，就是表现零下三十度的战斗生活的。北大荒的美术工作者不仅以自己的作品，而且以自己的顽强的劳动获得了战友们的赞扬。他们很愿意把自己所见到的事情找我们编出来、画出来，《英雄甸》《雁窝岛》（作良）等连环画就是在这种情况下画出来的。还有很多作品都是在野外篝火下，初稿经过了战友们的批评而创造的，它生动地体现了集体主义的精神。有时生产任务重，我们没有时间画画，职工们就主动把我们的生产任务顶下来，让我们安心创作。
    在这两年多来的劳动和创作中，我们深深地感到：一个美术工作者如果能在火热的斗争中和群众同呼吸共劳动，那我们的画笔将永远挥毫不尽，这充分证实了毛主席要艺术工作者们全心全意深入工农兵群众，改造思想这一指示的英明；同时，更有力地打击了“要艺术工作者下放劳动锻炼，是糟塌人材”的谰言。我们全体美术工作者如果没有党和毛泽东文艺方向的指导，没有在部队长时期来的阶级教育、艺术教育，是不能完成党所交给我们的任务的，今后一定踏踏实实地生活在农业战斗的最前线，听党的话，走党和毛主席指出的艺术道路，做一个名副其实的劳动者，也做一个名副其实的艺术工作者。
