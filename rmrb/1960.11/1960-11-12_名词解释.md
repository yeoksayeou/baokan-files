Glossary of Terms

	Coking Coal: The coke needed by the iron and steel industry cannot be produced from just any type of coal. Coking coal is always bituminous coal with a certain degree of cohesiveness. There are several types of bituminous coal that can be used for coking, including gas coal, fat coal, lean coal, and coking coal. Among these coking coals, coking coal is of the best quality. Coking coal alone produces coke with large block sizes, few cracks, high wear resistance, and high compressive strength. Because of the good quality of coking coal, it is usually mixed with other coking coals in a certain proportion, according to the requirements of the coke, to produce good coke. Therefore, coking coal is also called prime coking coal.

	Gas Coal: This is a type of bituminous coal with strong volatility. It contains some tar gas and carbon dioxide and other substances that are easily volatilized when heated. It has the effect of increasing the shrinkage of coke raw materials, making it easier for coke to be removed from the furnace.

	Fat Coal: This is a bituminous coal with high adhesion and good coking properties and is an important raw material for coking. However, when used alone to make coke, it produces many cracks and is easily broken, so it is generally mixed with other coking coals for smelting. Coke made from it has large block sizes and strong wear resistance.

	Lean Coal: This is a coking coal with weak adhesion. Coke made from it alone generally has more coke powder and is not wear-resistant. However, when it is mixed with other coking coals for coking, it can increase the block size of the coke and reduce cracks in the coke. Therefore, it is still an indispensable type of coal in coking coal.

    名词解释
    焦煤  钢铁工业需要的焦炭，并不是什么煤炭都可以炼成的。炼焦煤都是具有一定粘结性的烟煤。可以炼焦的烟煤有几种，它们是气煤、肥煤、瘦煤和焦煤等等。在这些炼焦煤中，以焦煤的质地为最好。单独用焦煤炼焦，结的焦炭块度大，裂纹少，耐磨，抗压强度高。由于焦煤质量好，通常是根据对焦炭的要求，按照一定的比例把焦煤与其它炼焦煤配合起来炼成好焦炭。所以人们又管焦煤叫主焦煤。
    气煤  这是一种挥发性较强的烟煤。它含有一些受热后容易挥发的焦油气和二氧化碳等物质。它有增加焦炭原料的收缩度的作用，使焦炭容易出炉。
    肥煤  是一种粘结力大，结焦性较好的烟煤，是炼焦的重要原料。但是，单独用来炼成焦炭裂纹多，容易碎，所以一般都是与其它的炼焦煤配合冶炼。用它炼焦，结成的焦炭块度大，耐磨性强。
    瘦煤  这是一种粘结性弱的炼焦煤。单独用它炼的焦炭一般焦粉较多，不耐磨。但是用它和其它炼焦煤配合炼焦，就可以提高焦炭的块度，减少焦炭的裂纹，因此，它仍然是炼焦煤中不可缺少的一个煤种。
