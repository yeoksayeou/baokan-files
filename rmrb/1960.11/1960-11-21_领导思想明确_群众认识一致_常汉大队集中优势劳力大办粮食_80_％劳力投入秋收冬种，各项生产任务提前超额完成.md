With Clear Leadership Ideology and Unified Mass Understanding,
    Changhan Brigade Concentrates Superior Labor Force to Vigorously Develop Grain Production
    80% of Labor Force Invested in Autumn Harvest and Winter Planting, Various Production Tasks Completed Ahead of Schedule and Above Quota

    (Our dispatch) The Changhan Brigade (basic accounting unit) of the Shiniu Commune in Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province, summarized and applied its successful experience in concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles during each busy farming season. In the autumn harvest and winter planting campaign, it concentrated 82.5% of its labor force into field production. By November 10, the entire brigade had completed the late rice harvesting task three days ahead of the original plan, and exceeded the plan by 19% in completing the winter planting tasks of wheat, vegetables, and other crops.

    The key to concentrating labor on the agricultural front lies in the clear thinking of leading cadres and the establishment of a grain-oriented ideology in everyone. At various times, the brigade's Party general branch has attached great importance to organizing cadres and the masses to study the documents and instructions of higher-level Party committees, so that the masses understand the principle that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and grain is the foundation of the foundation. When the reasoning is clear, the policy of "taking grain as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward" can be well implemented. For example, the brigade's joint factory and lime factory usually provide production tools and fertilizers for grain production; during busy farming seasons, they actively transfer manpower to participate in field labor. The brigade also clearly stipulates that the spring harvest and spring planting, the harvesting of early rice and the transplanting of late rice, and the autumn harvest and winter planting are the three major busy farming seasons. Other work and production are carried out according to the principle of "doing more when farming is slack, doing less when farming is busy, and doing nothing when farming is extremely busy" to ensure that agricultural production is not delayed. Based on the principle of long-term thinking and starting from the present, this brigade also stipulates that all capital construction must be carried out on the premise of ensuring the completion of current grain production. In order to ensure the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, the brigade Party branch actively conducted education for the members on the prospects of accelerating the socialist construction of the countryside, and conducted positive education for the members who were not at ease with agricultural production by commending good people and good deeds.

    On the basis of raising the ideological awareness of the members, in order to ensure the implementation of the policy of taking grain as the key link, the brigade formulated five principles for arranging labor: 1. The labor force participating in grain production should guarantee more than 80% during busy farming seasons and no less than 60% at ordinary times; 2. The diversified operations and sideline production organized by the brigade and production teams must not affect grain production, and manpower must be concentrated to support the front line during busy periods; 3. Canteen cooks, vegetable growers, and breeders should try to arrange auxiliary labor and semi-labor to do the work, so as to free up strong labor to participate in agricultural production; 4. Cadres participate in production and lead production; cadres' families work the same as members; 5. The labor force participating in the fields is fixed for use in basic production units; organizational collaboration must follow the principle of equivalent exchange. After the implementation of these five principles, the labor force participating in field production all year round accounted for 76% of the total rated labor force, reaching an average of one full male laborer and one more than half laborer for every nine mu of land; during busy farming seasons, more than 80% of the labor force can be concentrated to participate in field production. This not only guarantees the production needs based on agriculture and taking grain as the key link, but also promotes the comprehensive leap forward of other undertakings.

    In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the members, this brigade, while strengthening political and ideological work, also adhered to the principle of quota work points and distribution according to labor. The brigade and production teams have specifically strengthened their leadership over this work and actively trained work point recorders. Persisting in recording work points daily and pre-paying wages regularly, prompted each member to care about the fruits of labor from their own interests. In various production movements, the masses were mobilized to consciously formulate and abide by labor discipline, and labor competitions were widely organized between teams and groups, promoting opponent competitions of soldier against soldier and general against general, timely summarizing and comparing, inserting red flags, establishing pacesetters, promoting you to chase after me, and greatly improving labor efficiency.

    Improving the leadership style of cadres is also an important part of doing a good job in production. All five county-level working group cadres, twelve brigade cadres, and thirty-two production team cadres were fixed to work in work groups, living in the homes of poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, and combined with experienced farmers and technicians to cultivate a high-yield ridge and promote a working area. Cadres also determined the basic work points, implemented quota assistance and assessed and recorded points. In August and September, the team's forty-nine cadres completed more than 1,800 workdays, an average of twenty days per person per month, more than double the previous amount.

    To do a good job in production, we must do a good job in life. The small family production of the team's twenty-two canteens has developed rapidly, preparing the material basis for running the canteens well. In terms of combining work and rest, this team strictly implemented working hours, making cadres and members more and more enthusiastic and production better and better. (Attached picture)

### 领导思想明确　群众认识一致  常汉大队集中优势劳力大办粮食  80％劳力投入秋收冬种，各项生产任务提前超额完成

    领导思想明确　群众认识一致
    常汉大队集中优势劳力大办粮食
    80％劳力投入秋收冬种，各项生产任务提前超额完成
    本报讯　湖南双峰县石牛公社常汉大队（基本核算单位），总结运用各个大忙季节集中优势兵力打歼灭战的成功经验，在秋收冬播战斗中集中82.5％的劳力投入田间生产。到11月10日止，全大队按原计划提前三天完成了晚稻收割任务，超过计划19％完成了小麦、蔬菜等冬播任务。
    集中劳力主攻农业第一线的关键，在于领导干部思想明确，人人树立以粮为纲的思想。大队党总支在各个时期，都很重视组织干部和群众学习上级党委的文件和指示，使群众懂得农业是国民经济的基础、粮食是基础的基础的道理。道理清楚了，“以粮为纲、全面跃进”的方针就能够很好的贯彻执行。如大队的联合工厂和石灰厂，平时为粮食生产提供生产工具和肥料；在大忙季节，就主动地调出人力，参加田间劳动。大队还明确规定春收春种、收早稻插晚稻、秋收冬播为三大农忙季节，其他工作和生产都按照“农闲多干、农忙少干、大忙不干”的原则，保证不误农业生产。这个大队还本着从长远着想、从目前着手的原则，规定一切基本建设都必须在保证完成当前粮食生产的前提下去干。为了保证农业生产不断跃进，大队党支部积极对社员进行了加速农村社会主义建设的前景教育，对不安心农业生产的社员，通过表扬好人好事，进行正面教育。
    在提高社员思想认识的基础上，为了保证以粮为纲的方针的贯彻，大队制定了五项原则安排劳力：一、参加粮食生产的劳力，大忙季节保证80％以上，平时不少于60％；二、大队、生产队举办多种经营和副业生产，不得影响粮食生产，大忙时要集中劳力支援第一线；三、食堂炊事员、种菜员、饲养员，尽量安排辅助劳力和半劳力去干，腾出强劳力参加农业生产；四、干部参加生产，领导生产；干部家属和社员一样干活；五、参加田间的劳力，固定到基层生产单位使用；组织协作必须按照等价交换的原则。这五项原则实行后，常年参加田间生产的劳力占评级劳力总数的76％，达到了平均每九亩田土有一个男全劳力和一个多半劳力；大忙季节，可以集中80％以上劳力参加田间生产。这样既保证了以农业为基础、以粮为纲的生产需要，又促进了其他事业全面跃进。
    为了充分调动社员群众的劳动积极性，这个大队在加强政治思想工作的同时，还坚持了定额记工和按劳分配的原则。大队和生产队都具体加强了对这项工作的领导，积极培训了记工员。坚持按日记工、定期预支工资，促使每个社员从切身利益上去关心劳动成果。在各个生产运动中，发动群众自觉地制定和遵守劳动纪律，并广泛组织队与队、组与组之间开展劳动竞赛，推行兵对兵、将对将的对手赛、及时总结评比，大插红旗，大树标兵，促进你追我赶，大大提高了劳动效率。
    干部改进领导作风，也是搞好生产的重要一环。全队五个县级工作组干部、十二个大队干部、三十二个生产队干部，都分别固定到作业组，住在贫农和新老下中农家里，并和老农、技术员相结合，搞一条丰产垅，推动一个工作片。干部同样确定劳动底分，实行定额辅助和评工记分。8、9两个月，全队四十九个干部共做工日一千八百多个，平均每人每月做了二十个，超过以前一倍多。
    要搞好生产，必须搞好生活。全队二十二个食堂小家底生产发展很快，为办好食堂准备了物质基础。在劳逸结合上，这个队严格执行了作息时间，使干部、社员干劲越来越足，生产越搞越好。（附图片）
