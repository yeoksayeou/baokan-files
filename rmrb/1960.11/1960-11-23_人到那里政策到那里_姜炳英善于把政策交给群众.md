Wherever People Go, the Policies Follow
Jiang Bingying is good at conveying policies to the masses

Jiang Bingying is the Party Branch Secretary of the Xiaoyuzhuang Production Team in Lianzhen Commune, Jiahe County, Hebei Province. She is usually good at listening to the opinions of the masses and patiently explaining the policies to them. The commune members praised Jiang Bingying as: "Wherever people go, the policies follow!" Bingying usually works with the commune members. During breaks, she chats with them to publicize and explain the Party's policies. This year, when harvesting sweet potatoes, she chatted with the commune members: "Although this year's sweet potatoes have suffered from both drought and flood, they are still better than in previous years, right?" This sentence attracted the attention of the commune members. Some said: "This year's sweet potatoes are difficult to harvest, and it is not easy to harvest them cleanly." Some said: "If we don't harvest them quickly, they will freeze in the ground, and the loss will be great." Jiang Bingying patiently listened to people and gradually understood their thoughts, and then led them to the topic, publicizing the benefits of careful harvesting to the country, the collective, and the individual. The commune Party committee's call and the branch's requirements were all absorbed by the commune members, who exclaimed: The higher authorities' call is correct. This year's sweet potatoes are hard-won, and it would be a pity to throw away even one piece. When people realized the importance of careful harvesting, ideas also came up. Some proposed to establish groups, divide responsibilities, contract fixed plots, three people in a group, one person plowing, two people picking, setting quotas for work points, and giving rewards for exceeding the quotas. Jiang Bingying immediately helped the team leader divide the groups, and the work was very effective. She brought this method to the branch committee for discussion, and the branch believed it was a good method and promoted it widely in each team.

Jiang Bingying also talked to Wang Guitian, who was working at the threshing ground, about this method. After listening, Wang Guitian thought for a while and said: "This method works for harvesting sweet potatoes, but it has to be changed for other things." Jiang Bingying asked how to change it. Wang Guitian said: "Take harvesting millet as an example. After the harvest, many small ears grow out. The Second Team cultivated the land for planting wheat and harvested these small ears, which increased the harvest by more than 300 catties. The First Team did not harvest them and threw them on the ground. Isn't this a waste of public property?" Jiang Bingying said: "According to you, what should we do?" Wang Guitian said: "The Second Team should be rewarded, and the First Team should be criticized." After Jiang Bingying submitted this matter to the branch committee for research, they rewarded the Second Team and listed careful harvesting as one of the criteria for evaluating Five-Good Commune Members.

    人到那里政策到那里
    姜炳英善于把政策交给群众
    姜炳英是河北省交河县连镇公社小于庄生产队的党支部书记，她平时善于倾听群众的意见，耐心地向群众交代政策。社员们夸奖姜炳英是：“人走到哪里，政策走到那里！”炳英平常总是和社员一起干活，休息的时候，就和社员们拉家常，宣传解释党的政策。今年收甘薯的时候，她和社员们拉家常：“今年的甘薯虽然又旱又涝，可是比往年总还不错吧？”一句话把社员们的心思都引起来了。有的说：“今年的甘薯难收，不好收净。”有的说：“要不快点收，冻在地里，损失可就大了。”姜炳英耐心地听着人们说下去，渐渐地摸到社员的思想，然后引到正题上来，宣传精收细打对国家、集体和个人的好处，公社党委的号召，支部的要求，社员们都听得入了神，嚷嚷起来：上级号召的对，今年的甘薯得来不易，扔一块也可惜。当人们认识到精收的重要性后，办法也来了，有人提出建立小组，分工包干，固定地块，三人一组，一人耕，两人拾，定量定工分，超额给奖励的办法。姜炳英立时帮助这个小队干部分了组，干起活来效果很好。她把这个办法提到支委会讨论，支部认为是个好办法，在各小队普遍推广了。
    姜炳英又跟轧场的王桂田谈起这个办法。王桂田听完想了想说：“这个办法用在收甘薯上行，用在别处还得变。”姜炳英问怎个变法，王桂田说：“你就说收黍子吧，收完了，又长出不少小穗，二小队种麦整地，把这些小穗也收回来，又多收了三百多斤，一小队就未收，扔在地里了，这不是浪费公共财产吗？”姜炳英说：“依你说，怎么办好呢？”王桂田说：“二小队该奖励，一小队该批评。”姜炳英把这件事提交支委会研究以后，奖励了二小队，并把精收细打列为评比五好社员的内容之一。
