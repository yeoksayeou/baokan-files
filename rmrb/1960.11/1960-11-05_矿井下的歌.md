    Songs from the Mine
    (A Set of Poems)
    Hé Bō
    Heading Worker
    Oh, heroic heading worker, your spirit is like a rainbow spanning the sky;
    With the force to move mountains and overturn seas, it's as if you want to tunnel through the earth.
    The wind drill roars in your hands,
    Crushing the hard rock into dust;
    The electric drill sings before your chest,
    The coal seam is startled and trembles.
    In this deep mine,
    In this vast coal sea,
    To capture the black dragon,
    Heading workers are the vanguard of coal extraction.

    Blasting
    The miner's will is as strong as steel,
    Never afraid of difficulties and hardships;
    Day and night in the mine,
    Unfolding a solemn struggle.
    Stubborn rocks,
    Thick coal seams,
    Block our path,
    Preventing the advance of the coal-winning army.
    We gently place the powerful explosives,
    Into the rocks and coal seams;
    Followed by an earth-shattering roar,
    We victoriously advance again.

      Support Worker
    Oh, rocks, how heavy,
    Who can measure their weight in tens of millions of catties?
    It is they who imprison
    The coal marshal in the depths of the earth's crust.
    Brave support workers,
    Are the underground vanguard led by the Party;
    Possessing boundless wisdom,
    And filled with exuberant enthusiasm.
    For the safety of the mine,
    For the early completion of socialism;
    To make the coal marshal contribute to the motherland,
    Hold up a forest of props to welcome him.

    Coal Cutter
    The mine is as deep as the sea,
    The bottom leads to the earth's core;
    Endless black gold and ink jade,
    Buried deep beneath the earth.
    Bold coal-cutting experts,
    Descend into the abyss;
    Driving the combine harvester,
    To carry out a fierce struggle.
    Regardless of day or night,
    Rushing ahead of time;
    To bring forth the spring from underground,
    So that the ground is warmer and brighter.

    矿井下的歌
    （组诗）
    禾波
    掘进工英雄的掘进工啊，豪气似跨天的长虹；以移山倒海的气魄，仿佛要把地球凿通。风锤在手中怒吼，将坚硬的岩石粉碎；电钻在胸前歌唱，煤层也惊得抖动。在这深邃的井下，在这巨大的煤海，为了擒获黑色蛟龙，掘进工是夺煤先锋。
    爆　破矿工的意志似钢坚韧，从不怕困难与艰辛；朝夕在矿井底下，展开庄严的斗争。顽固的岩石，深厚的煤层，阻挡住我们的道路，不让夺煤大军前进。我们把猛烈的炸药，轻放进岩石和煤层；紧跟着惊天动地的轰鸣，我们又胜利进军。
      支柱工岩石啊，多么沉重，谁能衡量它有几千万斤？是它把煤炭元帅，幽禁在地壳底层。勇敢的支柱工人啊，是党领导的地下尖兵；有着无穷的智慧，和满怀奔放的热情。为了井下的安全，为了社会主义早日建成；要煤炭元帅向祖国作出贡献，撑起如林的支柱夹道欢迎。
    割　煤矿井深沉如海，井底通向地心；无尽的乌金墨玉，深埋在大地底层。胆大的割煤能手，下到万丈深坑；驾驶着康拜因，进行激烈的斗争。不论白天黑夜，抢行在时间前面；要托出地下的春天，使地上更温暖光明。
