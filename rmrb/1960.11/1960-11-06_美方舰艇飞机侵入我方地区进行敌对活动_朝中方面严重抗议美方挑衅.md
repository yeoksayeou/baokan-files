Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 4th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong, the 220th meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Korean Military Armistice Commission was held today at the suggestion of the U.S. side. The Secretary of the Korean and Chinese side severely condemned the U.S. attempt to cover up the criminal act of sending armed vessels to intrude into the coastal areas of the Korean and Chinese side for hostile activities, and lodged a serious protest against the U.S. side for sending vessels and aircraft to intrude into the coastal and air space of the Korean and Chinese side.

The Secretary of the Korean and Chinese side pointed out that at about 18:00 on October 30th, a U.S. tank landing craft intruded into a place about 4.5 kilometers southwest of Wolnae-do in the area of the Korean and Chinese side, and carried out blatant hostile activities. Korean coast guards took self-defense measures, and the landing craft fled in panic after being hit. On October 31st, a U.S. aircraft flew from the South Sea and intruded into the airspace over Feiya Island and Qilin Island in the West Sea of the Korean and Chinese side. On November 2nd, two U.S. F-86 jet aircraft again intruded into the airspace over Dade Mountain, Rune Mountain, and Lingjing-ri near Kaesong in the area of the Korean and Chinese side.

At the same time, the Secretary of the Korean and Chinese side demanded that the U.S. side severely punish all U.S. personnel involved in the aforementioned violations in accordance with the armistice agreement, and take measures to prevent such incidents from happening again.

    美方舰艇飞机侵入我方地区进行敌对活动
    朝中方面严重抗议美方挑衅
    新华社平壤4日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议根据美方建议今天举行第二百二十次会议。朝中方面秘书长在会上严厉谴责了美方企图掩盖它派遣武装舰艇侵入朝中方面地区沿海进行敌对活动的犯罪行为的阴谋，并对美方又派遣舰艇和飞机侵入朝中方面地区的沿海和上空的行为提出严重抗议。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，10月30日十八时左右，美方坦克登陆艇一艘侵入朝中方面地区月内岛西南方向约四点五公里的地方，进行露骨的敌对行为，朝鲜海岸警备队员采取了自卫措施，这一登陆艇受到打击后仓惶逃走。10月31日，美方飞机一架从南海飞来侵入了朝中方面地区西海飞鸦岛和麒麟岛的上空。11月2日，美方F—86型喷气式飞机二架又侵入朝中方面地区内开城附近的大德山、如尼山、领井里等地上空。
    朝中方面秘书长指出，美方不顾朝中方面的一再抗议和警告，继续破坏停战协定。他强调说，由此招致的一切后果全部要由美方负责。
    同时，朝中方面秘书长要求美方根据停战协定严惩同这次提出的侵犯事件有关的所有美方人员，并采取措施使此类事件不再发生。
