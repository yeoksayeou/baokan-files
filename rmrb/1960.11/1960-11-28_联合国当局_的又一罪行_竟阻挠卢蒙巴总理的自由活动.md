Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Leopoldville Dispatch: The American-controlled "United Nations Authorities" on the 25th actually obstructed Congolese Premier Lumumba from going to Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, which is the main base of the Congolese National Movement party he leads. This is part of the US imperialism's conspiracy to actively foster puppets in the Congo, attack the legitimate government of the Congo, and restrict Lumumba's freedom of movement.

The news said that on the 25th, Lumumba requested the "United Nations Authorities" to provide him with an airplane so that he could, according to custom, send the body of his recently deceased child to Stanleyville for burial. The "United Nations Authorities" refused to provide any means of transportation and threatened not to provide "protection," obstructing him from going to Stanleyville. For two months, the "United Nations Authorities" have been holding Lumumba under house arrest in his residence in Leopoldville in the name of "protection."

At the same time, the Mobutu rebel group, supported by the United States, has intensified its armed blockade around Lumumba's residence, with three or five sentries guarding each passage. Every nearby intersection has been blocked off and marked with arrows to indicate that vehicles must bypass the area.

Meanwhile, under the instigation of imperialism, the Tshombe traitorous clique in Katanga Province and the Ileo (head of an illegal government in the Congo) clique have intensified their collusion, plotting further conspiracies to undermine Congolese independence. According to Reuters, an "delegation" of three from Ileo held a two-hour "meeting" with the Tshombe clique in Elisabethville on the 25th. The communique issued after the meeting did not even mention the name of the Republic of the Congo, but said that "complete consensus" had been reached on actions concerning the internal affairs of "the former Belgian Congo," and planned to hold a "round table conference" in Elisabethville in December this year to discuss the so-called "political structure" of the future of the Congo.

    “联合国当局”的又一罪行
    竟阻挠卢蒙巴总理的自由活动
    新华社26日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：美国操纵的“联合国当局”25日竟阻挠刚果总理卢蒙巴去他领导的刚果民族运动党的主要根据地——东方省省会斯坦利维尔。这是美帝国主义在刚果积极扶植傀儡、打击刚果合法政府和限制卢蒙巴自由活动的阴谋的一部分。
    消息说，25日，卢蒙巴曾要求“联合国当局”为他提供一架飞机，让他按照习俗把他刚死去的孩子的尸体送往斯坦利维尔安葬，“联合国当局”拒绝提供任何交通工具，并且以不提供“保护”相威胁，阻挠他去斯坦利维尔。两个月来，“联合国当局”一直以“保护”为名把卢蒙巴软禁在利奥波德维尔他的住宅内。
    同时，美国支持下的蒙博托叛乱集团在卢蒙巴住宅的周围加紧武装封锁，每条通道都有三个或五个哨兵把守。邻近的每个交叉路口都被封锁，并画有箭头标明车辆要绕过这一地区。
    同时，在帝国主义撮合下，加丹加省冲伯卖国集团同伊利奥
  （刚果的一个非法政府首脑）集团之间加紧进行勾结，策划进一步破坏刚果独立的阴谋。据路透社报道，伊利奥的一个三人“代表团”25日在伊利沙伯维尔同冲伯集团举行了两小时的“会谈”。会谈后发表的公报甚至不提刚果共和国这个名称，而说“前比属刚果”内政方面的行动取得了“完全一致的看法”，并计划今年12月在伊利沙伯维尔召开“圆桌会议”讨论所谓刚果未来的“政治结构”问题。
