Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 2nd. According to the agreement signed in Paris last month on the 25th between the de Gaulle government and the West German government, the first batch of over two thousand West German "Federal Defence Forces" troops heading to French territory for training and exercises have all departed from their bases in West Germany for France today.

The agreement stipulates that West German troops will establish "logistical bases" and conduct training on French territory. The first batch of West German troops to go to France for a three-week training and exercise period totals two thousand five hundred people. Their advance detachment of two hundred people entered France on October 26th. Today, the 251st and 261st Parachute Battalions stationed in Württemberg and the 51st and 53rd Armored Infantry Battalions stationed in North Hesse also set off for France. These West German troops will conduct military exercises in Mourmelon and Sissonne in France.

The French public is extremely indignant that the German militarist army, which occupied France twice since the First World War and massacred the French people, is appearing on French territory again. In Mourmelon, where the advance detachment of West German troops is stationed, French residents who encounter West German soldiers on the road quickly run to the other side of the road to avoid walking with them. "France-Soir" reported on the "cold meeting" in a Mourmelon cafe between French soldiers and West German soldiers on a holiday. For three hours, these French soldiers did not say a word to or look at the West German soldiers.

A statement issued by the Peace Committee of Ain Province pointed out that the entry of West German troops into France is an insult to the French people and to the memory of the soldiers who sacrificed themselves in the anti-fascist struggle. The statement called on the residents of Ain Province to mark the day of the large-scale entry of West German troops into France as a day of grief to express their condemnation of "such an action that violates French interests and endangers peace."

The National Congress of the Former French Resistance Fighters Association, held recently in Nice, unanimously passed a resolution condemning the establishment of West German military bases on French territory. The Association of Former Prisoners of the Nazi Mauthausen Death Camp also issued a statement opposing "lending bases on French territory to German (West German) troops."

The Moselle Provincial Branch of the National Federation of Deported and Detained Resistance Fighters called on patriots throughout the province to hold a large-scale demonstration on the 13th in front of the Oradour-sur-Glane memorial to protest the entry of West German troops into France. Oradour-sur-Glane, in the Haute-Vienne department of France, was razed to the ground by the Hitler gang in 1944, and all its residents were brutally murdered. In a call to action, this patriotic organization emphasized: "The victims of Oradour and the (Nazi) concentration camps should never be forgotten."

    永远不会忘记死难同胞和纳粹集中营
    法国人民反对西德军队开进法国
    首批二千多名西德军队前往法国进行训练和演习
    新华社巴黎2日电　根据戴高乐政府同西德政府上月25日在巴黎签订的协定，到法国领土上进行训练和演习的第一批西德“联邦国防军”两千多人，今天全部由他们在西德的基地开来法国。
    这一协定规定，西德军队在法国领土上建立“后勤基地”和进行训练。第一批到法国进行为期三周的训练和演习的西德军队总共二千五百人。他们的先遣部队二百人10月26日就开进了法国。今天，驻在符腾堡的西德第二五一和二六一伞兵营和驻在北黑森的第五十一和五十三装甲步兵营又动身前来法国。这批西德军队将在法国的摩默隆和西桑纳两地进行军事演习。
    法国公众对于第一次世界大战以来两次占领法国、屠杀法国人民的德国军国主义军队又在法国领土上出现，极为愤慨。在西德先遣部队驻扎的摩默隆，凡是在路上碰见西德军人的法国居民都迅速跑到马路的另一边，不与他们同行。“法兰西晚报”报道了假日里法国士兵同西德军人在摩默隆一家咖啡馆中的“冰冷的会面”。在三个小时中，这些法国士兵没有向西德士兵说过一句话、看过他们一眼。
    法国安省和平委员会发表的声明指出，西德军队的进入法国是对法国人民和对在反法西斯斗争中牺牲的战士的记忆的侮辱。声明号召安省的居民把大批西德军队进入法国的日子作为一个沉痛的日子，以表示他们谴责“这样一个违背法国利益，并且危害和平的行动”。
    不久前在尼斯召开的前法国抵抗运动战士全国协会的代表大会一致通过了决议，谴责在法国领土上建立西德军事基地。前纳粹毛特豪森死亡营被囚者协会也发表了声明，反对“把在法国领土上的基地借给德国（西德）军队”。
    被驱逐和被拘留的抵抗战士全国联合会摩泽尔省分会号召全省爱国者13日到奥拉多尔死难者纪念碑前举行大规模示威，抗议西德军队进入法国。奥拉多尔在法国上维也纳省格朗河畔，1944年被希特勒匪帮夷为平地，全体居民惨被屠杀。这个爱国组织在一份号召书中强调说：“永远不应当忘记奥拉多尔的死难者和（纳粹）集中营”。
