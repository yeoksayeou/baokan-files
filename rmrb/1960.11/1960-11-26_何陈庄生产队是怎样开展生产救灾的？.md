How Did the He Chenzhuang Production Team Carry Out Production for Disaster Relief?
The Production Office of the Cang County Committee of the Communist Party of China

The He Chenzhuang Production Team of Da Zhu Village Commune in Cang County, Hebei, correctly implemented the policy of production for disaster relief and vigorously developed sideline production. Now, every team has small handicraft processing factories, every household engages in family sideline occupations, and there is income every day. Although agricultural production suffered from disasters this year, resulting in significant losses, thanks to the good development of sideline production, they not only managed to pay wages on time every month, but also added a batch of production and living materials.

How did they carry out winter sideline production?

Using Local Materials, Production is Limitless

This year, the He Chenzhuang Production Team suffered from drought and flood disasters. Out of the team's 3,629 mu of land, the actual harvested area was only 880 mu. However, under the leadership of the Party, they were not intimidated by the disaster situation. Instead, relying on the superiority of the People's Commune, the team branch united all cadres and the masses to launch a production for disaster relief campaign.

In order to implement the guideline of sideline production "serving agricultural production, serving people's lives, and serving the expansion of reproduction next year," they first mobilized cadres and the masses to conduct four investigations (investigating farm tools, investigating livelihood, investigating canteens, investigating warehouses) and five calculations (calculating the investment for next year's production and how much grain to produce, calculating how many commodities can be produced from the raw materials for developing sideline production, calculating how many people use how much labor, calculating food for people and fodder for horses, and calculating income and expenditure). After calculating food, clothing, supplies, money, production, income, and considering both this year and next year, the team needed 12,000 yuan for living expenses and more than 10,500 yuan for production (agriculture and sideline occupations) investment by the end of June next year. Where could this money be found? Could developing sideline production solve the problem? Where would the raw materials for production come from? Initially, some team cadres and members did not have a clear understanding of this issue, lacked confidence, and had few ideas. The Party branch promptly proposed: developing sideline production must adhere to the principles of serving agricultural production and serving the lives of the members, and can only start from production and cannot engage in commercial activities; at the same time, it convened a symposium of sideline production experts, summarized the experience of past sideline production, and identified six types of production raw materials and avenues: (1) Vigorously promote the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products. For example, corn husks can be used to make starch and artificial fiber for spinning and weaving. (2) Organize manpower to collect grass and firewood. The team has thirteen large donkeys and more than one hundred small donkeys. Collecting grass and firewood can not only solve the problem of fuel for heating and feed for livestock, but also increase income. (3) Utilize existing raw materials in the team to develop processing industries. For example, wool can be spun into yarn to knit sweaters and socks, wheat stalks can be woven into straw hat braids, sorghum ears can be used to bind brooms, sorghum stalks can be used to nail pot lids, and reeds can be woven into mats. (4) In addition, wild rabbits, wild susliks running on the ground, wild geese and wild ducks flying in the sky, and fish and shrimp swimming in the water can all be captured. (5) Willow, mulberry, and vitex growing on the edge of villages, slopes, ditches, and fields can be used. Thicker ones can be woven into baskets, and thinner ones can be woven into ladles and animal muzzles. (6) Dried pear and jujube trees that are dug up can be used by carpenters to make large and small farm tools to support next year's large-scale production. The team branch adopted their suggestions and decided: produce whatever raw materials are available and never compete with large industries for raw materials; produce whatever the country needs. The result of doing so is: using local materials, production avenues are limitless, and income is unlimited.

Reasonable Arrangement of Labor, Members Have Both Work and Rest

Although it is not the busiest time for agricultural production now, the team still has more than 300 mu of land uncultivated, winter irrigation is underway for wheat, there is still some threshing to be done, livestock grass still needs to be chopped, and sideline production also needs to be carried out. There are still many things to do. The team branch believes that the key to doing a good job in production for disaster relief lies first in the reasonable arrangement of labor. Based on the size of various production and livelihood tasks, they adopted the method of allocating labor proportionally, achieving both work and rest, and comprehensive arrangement. The allocation ratio of labor is: 35% of the labor is engaged in agriculture, 45% of the labor is engaged in sideline and handicraft production, and 20% of the labor is engaged in the processing, collection, and storage of living materials. Appropriate work was also arranged for auxiliary labor such as elderly women and old men. This has made a reasonable arrangement for production and livelihood, agriculture and sideline production.

Secondly, the production team further clarified the scope of sideline operations in various aspects: ① Those that are difficult for a small team to organize are organized by the production team; ② Small-scale production suitable for small team operation is assigned to small teams according to the "three guarantees and one reward" method; ③ In addition to collective and individual breeding of pigs and chickens, canteens are encouraged to raise more. ④ Scattered production such as weaving straw hat braids and cattail baskets are operated by the members themselves. At the same time, the issue of income distribution was reasonably resolved: for those operated by the production team, the small team contributes manpower and livestock labor, and the production team gives work points to the small team; for the production assigned by the production team to the small team, the excess part is divided in a three-seven split, 30% goes to the production team, and 70% goes to the small team; the income from the small team's own operations is controlled by the small team; and the income from the members' operations belongs to themselves.

Thirdly, adhere to putting politics in command and implement the principle of distribution according to work. The masses have high enthusiasm for production, labor quotas are constantly being broken, and each team has completed the production tasks assigned by the brigade. However, the income gap between small teams is still large: the number of production people and the items produced in Team One and Team Two are the same, but in October, each work point in Team One was worth 1.13 yuan, and each work point in Team Two was 0.99 yuan higher than that in Team One. The reason is that Team Two adhered to putting politics in command and overfulfilled the production tasks. This fact powerfully educated the cadres of Team One, and they decided to strengthen political and ideological work in future work.

After the launch of production for disaster relief, the members have high production enthusiasm. From October 1st to now, 160 people in the team have been投入 into sideline production. The income from sideline production has strongly supported the current production, supported the people's lives, and supported next year's agricultural production. In October, the sideline income of the entire brigade, in addition to paying more than 400 yuan in wages to the members and buying eight tons of coal, also bought a batch of production materials, including three double-铧 plows, more than 230 small farm tools, and large carts. Currently, the sideline production of this team is still actively developing.

    何陈庄生产队是怎样开展生产救灾的？
    中共沧县县委生产办公室
    河北沧县大猪村公社何陈庄生产队，正确贯彻生产救灾的方针，大搞副业生产。现在是队队有小手工业加工厂，户户有家庭副业，天天有收入。虽然今年农业生产受了灾，损失很大，但是，由于副业生产搞得好，不仅做到了按月发工资，还添置了一批生产、生活资料。
    他们是怎样开展冬季副业生产的呢？
    就地取材　生产无边
    何陈庄生产队今年遭受了旱、涝灾害，全队三千六百二十九亩地，实收面积只有八百八十亩。但是，他们在党的领导下，没有被灾情所吓倒，而是依靠着人民公社的优越性，队支部团结全体干部、群众，展开了生产救灾运动。
    他们为了贯彻副业生产“为农业生产服务、为人民生活服务、为明年扩大再生产服务”的方针，首先发动干部、群众，从生产、生活入手，进行了四查（查农具、查生活、查食堂、查仓库）、五算（算明年生产投资和打多少粮食、算开展副业生产的原料能生产多少商品、算有多少人用多少工、算人吃和马喂、算收入和支出）。经过算吃、算穿，算物、算钱，算生产、算收入，算今年、也算了明年，全队到明年6月底，生活需要一万二千元，生产（农、副业）投资需要一万零五百多元。这些钱从哪里找？搞副业生产能解决吗？生产原料从哪里来？开始有的队干部和社员对这个问题认识不明确，信心不足，办法不多。党支部及时提出：搞副业生产必须本着为农业生产服务、为社员生活服务的原则，只能从生产入手、不能有商业行为；同时召开了副业生产能手座谈会，总结了往年进行副业生产的经验，找出了六种生产原料和生产门路：（一）大搞农副产品的综合利用。例如玉米包皮能制淀粉，也能制成人造纤维纺纱织布。（二）组织人力搂草拾柴。全队有十三张大?一百多张小?，搂草拾柴不仅能解决取暖的燃料和牲畜的饲料，还能增加收入。（三）利用本队既有原料，发展加工工业。如：羊毛可以纺毛线、织毛衣、毛袜，麦秆可编草帽辫，高粱穗可缚扫帚，高粱秆可钉锅盖，苇子可织席。（四）还有地上跑的野兔、野黄鼠狼，天上飞的野雁、野鸭，水里游的鱼虾，都可以捕捉。（五）村边、堤坡、沟沿、场边长的柳、桑、荆条，粗些的可编筐，细条可编笊篱、牲口龙嘴。（六）干枯的梨、枣树刨下来能供木匠制造大小农具，支持明年大生产。队支部采纳了他们的意见，决定：有什么原料，就搞什么生产，绝不与大工业争原料；国家需要什么，就生产什么。这样做的结果是：就地取材，生产门路无边，收入无限。
    合理安排劳力　社员有劳有逸
    现在农业生产虽然不是大忙的时候，可是全队有三百多亩地没有耕，小麦正在冬灌，打场还有个尾巴，牲口草还需铡，副业生产也要进行，要做的事情还很多。队支部认为，搞好生产救灾工作的关键，首先在于合理安排劳力。他们根据各项生产、生活任务的大小，采取按比例支配劳动力的办法，做到了有劳有逸，全面安排。劳动力的分配比例是：35％的劳力搞农业，45％的劳力搞副业、手工业生产，20％的劳力搞生活资料的加工、采集、储藏。对老婆、老头等辅助劳力，也安排了适当的活。这就使生产和生活、农业和副业都有了合理的安排。
    其次，生产队还进一步划清了各方面的经营副业的范围：①凡是一个小队很难举办的，就由生产队组织生产；②适合小队经营的小型生产，就分别制定定额，按“三包一奖”的办法包给小队经营；③养猪、鸡等，除集体和社员个人饲养外，鼓励食堂多养。④零星生产如编草帽辫、蒲囤等归社员经营。同时合理解决了收益分配问题：生产队经营的，小队出了人畜工，由生产队给小队工分；生产队包给小队的生产，超额部分按三七开，30％归生产队，70％归小队；小队自己经营收入，归小队支配；社员经营的收入归本人。
    第三、坚持政治挂帅，贯彻按劳分配的原则。群众生产积极性高，劳动定额不断被突破，队队完成了大队分配的生产任务。但是，小队与小队之间的收入差别还很大：一小队和二小队生产人数相等项目相同，可是一小队10月份每个工值一元三角，二小队每个工值比一小队高九毛九分钱。原因是二小队坚持了政治挂帅，超额完成了生产任务。这个事实有力地教育了一小队的干部，他们决定在今后工作中切实加强政治思想工作。
    开展生产救灾之后，社员生产情绪很高。从10月1日起到现在，全队有一百六十人投入副业生产，副业生产的收入有力地支持了当前生产，支持了人民生活，支持了明年的农业生产。全大队10月份的副业收入除发给社员工资四百多元，买煤八吨，还买了一批生产资料，其中有双铧犁三张，小农具二百三十多件以及大车等。现在这个队的副业生产仍在积极地发展中。
