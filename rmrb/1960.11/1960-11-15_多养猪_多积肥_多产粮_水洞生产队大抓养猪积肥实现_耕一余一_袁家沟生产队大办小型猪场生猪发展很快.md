Raise More Pigs, Accumulate More Manure, Produce More Grain
    Shuidong Production Team Focuses on Pig Raising and Manure Accumulation to Achieve "One Year's Surplus After Cultivation"
    Yuanjiagou Production Team Runs Small-Scale Pig Farms, and Hog Production Develops Rapidly

    Xining, November 14th (Reported by this newspaper) - The Shuidong Production Team of Heerchuan Commune in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, actively raises pigs and accumulates manure, truly achieving more pigs, more manure, and more grain. The team currently has 873 pigs in stock, averaging five pigs per household; after deducting grain purchases, rations, seeds, and feed from the total annual grain output, there is still a year's worth of grain reserves, achieving the goal of "one year's surplus after cultivation."

    Shuidong is a mountainous production team with historically extensive farming practices, a small amount of base fertilizer, and very low yields. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Tibetan and Han members of the team conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and resolved to focus on fertilizer, the key to increasing production in mountainous areas, and began to develop pig raising.

    This production team has always closely linked pig raising with manure accumulation. They implemented a "quantity-based, excess-reward" manure accumulation system for the collective pig farm's feeders; for the manure from household pig raising by members, they implemented a "quality-based pricing, cash purchase" method. Last year, the team paid 9,000 yuan in cash for manure purchases. This pig manure has played a significant role in increasing grain production over the past two years.

    In the process of developing pig raising, the Shuidong Production Team has consistently adhered to the principle of "collective raising as the main, private raising as supplementary, combining public and private." Currently, the team has one production team pig farm and five small team pig farms. To facilitate pig raising by members, they adopted the method of "collective grazing, proportional profit sharing," that is, taking the small team as a unit to concentrate the privately raised pigs of the members, and the small team draws labor to carry out collective grazing during the day, and the members manage them individually at night; the grazers are uniformly recorded work points by the production team, and the members pay a certain percentage of the number of piglets bred to the production team twice a year as remuneration for the grazers.

    Lanzhou, November 14th (Reported by this newspaper) - The Yuanjiagou Production Team of Kangning People's Commune in Wudu County, Gansu Province, implements the "small groups, many points" approach of running small-scale pig farms mainly by production teams, relying on the masses to broadly open up feed sources, enabling the pig-raising industry to achieve a sustained Great Leap Forward. The team currently has 59.74% more pigs in stock than at the end of last year.

    In 1959, under the slogan of "pigs as the head, livestock prospers," a pig breeding management committee was established, headed by the secretary of the production team's Party branch. The method of collective breeding as the main, private breeding as supplementary, small groups, many points, and large-scale small pig farms was adopted, with everyone taking action to develop sow groups and implement self-breeding.

    The great development of pig production in the team has brought many new changes to production and the lives of members. First, it provided a large amount of high-quality fertilizer for agriculture, promoting increased agricultural production. In 1958, the team set up a pig farm, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land increased by an average of one time, and the grain output increased by 46%; after achieving one pig per mu last year, the average fertilizer application per mu was more than 4,000 jin, and the average yield per mu of summer and autumn crops increased by nearly 19% on the basis of 1958. Second, with more pigs and more income, the living standards of the members have also been improved.

    The high-speed development of pig production in the Yuanjiagou Production Team is mainly due to the implementation of the principle of public raising as the main, private raising as supplementary, combining public and private raising, and public raising mainly by small teams, running more small-scale pig farms. The team implements a "three guarantees and one reward" system for the publicly raised part. The production team guarantees fertilizer, guarantees breeding, guarantees fatness, and rewards the excess, and the pigs raised belong to the production team. At present, publicly raised pigs account for 79.9% of the total, and privately raised pigs account for 20.1%. Practice has proved that it is beneficial to focus on pig raising by small teams and to run small-scale pig farms on a large scale: equipment and labor problems are easy to solve; investment is small, and farms can be run diligently and frugally; feed can be collected and processed locally; farms can be built according to local conditions, saving labor for transporting fertilizer; and it is easy to strengthen feeding management.

### 多养猪　多积肥　多产粮  水洞生产队大抓养猪积肥实现“耕一余一”  袁家沟生产队大办小型猪场生猪发展很快

    多养猪　多积肥　多产粮
    水洞生产队大抓养猪积肥实现“耕一余一”
    袁家沟生产队大办小型猪场生猪发展很快
    本报西宁14日电　青海省互助土族自治县贺尔川公社水洞生产队，积极养猪积肥，真正做到了猪多、肥多、粮多。全队现有存栏猪八百七十三头，平均每户养猪五头；全年粮食总产量扣除征购粮、口粮、种子、饲料外，还有一年的储备粮，实现了“耕一余一”的目标。
    水洞是一个山区生产队，历史上耕作粗放，基肥数量少，产量很低。在1958年的大跃进中，这个队的藏族、汉族社员认真贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，决心狠抓肥料这一山区增产的关键，开始发展养猪事业。
    这个生产队一向把养猪和积肥紧密结合起来。他们对集体养猪场的饲养员，实行“以畜定量，超额奖励”的积肥制度；对社员家庭养猪的粪便，实行“以质定价，现金收买”的办法。去年全队支付收买肥料的现金达九千元。这些猪粪，对于两年来粮食的增产起了很大作用。
    在发展养猪事业的过程中，水洞生产队始终坚持执行了“公养为主，私养为辅，公私并举”的方针。现在全队有一个生产队养猪场和五个小队养猪场。为了便利社员养猪，他们采取了“集体放牧，比例提成”的办法，即以小队为单位把社员的私养猪集中起来，由小队抽劳动力进行日间集体放牧，晚上由社员个人管理；放牧员由生产队统一记工分，社员则按仔猪繁殖数的一定比例，每年分两次提成交给生产队作为放牧员的报酬。
    本报兰州14日电　甘肃武都县康宁人民公社袁家沟生产队，实行以生产小队为主大办小型养猪场的“小群多点”方针，依靠群众广开饲料来源，使养猪事业获得了持续大跃进。全队目前实有存栏猪，比去年年终净增59.74％。
    1959年在“以猪为首，六畜兴旺”的行动口号下，由生产队党支部书记挂帅，成立了生猪饲养管理委员会，采用以集体饲养为主，私人饲养为辅，小群多点，大办小型养猪场的办法，全民动手，大搞母猪群，实行自繁自养。
    全队生猪大发展，给生产和社员生活带来了许多新的变化。首先，是给农业提供了大批优质肥料，促进了农业的增产。1958年全队办起养猪场，每亩土地施肥量平均增加一倍，粮食产量就增产了46％；去年实现一亩地一猪后，每亩平均施肥四千斤以上，夏秋作物平均亩产又在1958年的基础上增长了近19％。其次，猪多收入多，社员生活水平也得到提高。
    袁家沟生产队生猪获得高速度发展，主要是执行了公养为主、私养为辅、公养私养并举和公养部分以小队为主，多办小型养猪场的方针。全队公养部分实行“三包一奖”制，由生产小队包肥料、包繁殖、包膘分，超额部分进行奖励，所饲生猪归生产队所有。现在，全队公养猪占总数的79.9％，私养占20.1％。实践证明，大抓小队养猪，大办小型猪场有许多好处：设备、劳力问题容易解决；投资少，可以勤俭办场；饲料可以就地采集，就地加工；因地建场，节省运肥劳力；便于加强饲养管理。（附图片）
