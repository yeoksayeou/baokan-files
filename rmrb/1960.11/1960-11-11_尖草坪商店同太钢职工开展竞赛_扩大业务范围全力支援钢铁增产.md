Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 10th: Workers at the Jiancaoping Store in Taiyuan City have launched a store-factory competition with workers from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), combining the mass movement within the store with the mass movement in the steel company. They are working together to strive for high steel production, which has powerfully promoted rapid production growth.

The Jiancaoping Store is a large comprehensive store primarily serving TISCO and is a model unit on the financial and trade front in Shanxi Province. This year, the store has learned from and promoted the advanced experience of the Tongjialiang Store, moving the original production materials supply station and daily necessities supply station near TISCO, and newly built a non-staple food processing station and a privately-run commission sales management station. To ensure delivery to the doorstep, the number of fixed stores and commission sales points located at construction sites and near furnaces has increased from twenty-one to fifty-four. In addition, a mobile service supply team of more than one hundred and twenty people has been formed to regularly sell goods at construction sites and workshops.

In the production increase and economizing campaign centered on grain and steel, TISCO workers launched a mass campaign focused on the three key areas of raw materials, transportation, and equipment maintenance. The quantity and variety of production materials needed increased dramatically, and the required supply time became even more urgent. While vigorously grasping production, the company's Party committee also comprehensively arranged for the workers' livelihood. After analyzing this situation, the Jiancaoping Commune and the store's Party committee believed that to serve steel production more promptly and effectively, it was necessary to treat the production key points of TISCO as their own key points to solve and to arrange the lives of factory workers as their own lives. To this end, they closely cooperated with the work arrangements of the TISCO Party committee, mobilized, and organized store employees to launch a heated competition with TISCO workers. They proposed three guarantees: (1) The three types of materials urgently needed for production, except for local building materials, including hardware, electrical materials, pipe fittings, and protective equipment, will all be contracted to be supplied, striving to guarantee supply in every possible way; (2) Vigorously support the TISCO workers' collective canteen with manpower and material resources to ensure that workers eat well, economically, and hygienically, so that workers can always maintain sufficient energy; (3) Vigorously grasp livelihood service work to ensure that workers can concentrate on production without worries. This proposal immediately received an enthusiastic response from TISCO workers. The workers of the First and Second Steelmaking Plants proposed: guarantee high quality, high output, safety, and high attendance. The workers of the Transportation Department proposed: guarantee to achieve more transportation and faster speed, providing sufficient raw materials for the blast furnace. To ensure the realization of the competition conditions, under the leadership of the TISCO and Jiancaoping Store Party committees, a joint competition committee was established to organize competitions and evaluations in a timely manner. Thus, the competition between stores and factories, groups, and furnaces was launched enthusiastically.

To achieve the competition conditions, the Jiancaoping Store tried every means to move the supply work ahead of production and life needs. They transferred more than 300 employees to form a professional steel support supply team and a professional team for workers' economic life, going to the front line of production and workers' dormitory areas to inquire about production and life, and proposed their new tasks in coordination with each key task activity. In TISCO equipment maintenance, they ascertained the repair time and the quantity and variety of materials needed for large equipment in blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and coke ovens. In addition to raising materials in their own store, they also adopted the method of "linking up all parties and jointly supporting steel," taking the initiative to contact 28 units, including the Taiyuan Department Store, to jointly reserve spare parts for TISCO. Now, under the unified planning of the Jiancaoping Store, these units also actively send goods to the site. While organizing the supply of production materials, store employees also regarded vigorously grasping the collective canteen for steel workers as an important task. They conducted a comprehensive survey of TISCO's seventy-eight employee canteens, and successively transferred forty-one excellent chefs to go deep into backward canteens to impart skills and help improve management. With the help of store employees, these backward canteens generally achieved democratic management, planned use of grain, sufficient portions of food and vegetables, and hygiene, which was praised by the workers.

During the competition, the Jiancaoping Store employees saw the selfless labor enthusiasm of the steel workers at the front line of production, prompting them to be more actively concerned about the workers' lives and expand the scope of service. They put forward the slogan of action: not only be a good salesperson but also a good "housekeeper" for the workers and a good propagandist and mobilizer. In the activity of TISCO workers concentrating their efforts to support the Second Steelmaking Plant in seizing high output, the Jinfengying mobile sales team here launched a furnace-group competition with the workers of the No. 7 furnace. They reasonably supplied goods according to the needs of the workers, and sold books, newspapers, and magazines, delivered letters, sent parcels, and remitted money at the front line of production, achieving "supplying goods beside the furnace every day and serving the steel workers wholeheartedly," helping the No. 7 furnace workers maintain the glorious title of "Red Flag Furnace." The economic life professional team employees active in the workers' dormitory area went deep into the family dormitories and, in cooperation with the family committee, generally rectified the family commission sales points, helping to improve the procedures and management, which greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the commission sales personnel. At the same time, the production service organizations such as family dismantling, washing, and mending were also rectified and consolidated.

Due to the competition, the Jiancaoping Store employees more actively improved their service attitude and expanded their sources of goods. Now, in terms of production materials supply, they have undertaken all the supply tasks of hardware, electrical materials, protective equipment, medical and health supplies, and groceries, and have a certain amount of reserves. This not only saved TISCO more than two hundred purchasing agents to directly support the front line of production, but also shortened the overhaul time of open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces due to the relatively sufficient spare parts. In assisting TISCO in arranging the lives of employees, all eighty-eight employee canteens in the company, except for grain, are supplied with vegetables, non-staple foods, and groceries by the Jiancaoping Store on a contracted basis. Therefore, they are called the "good logistics" of production and the "good housekeeper" of life by TISCO workers. Whenever TISCO holds an evaluation and award ceremony, it invites store employees to participate, and the units that win the Red Flag must report the good news to the store. All the store's commodity transportation is undertaken by TISCO.

    尖草坪商店同太钢职工开展竞赛
    扩大业务范围全力支援钢铁增产
    据新华社太原10日电　太原市尖草坪商店职工同太原钢铁公司职工开展店厂竞赛，把商店内部的群众运动和钢铁公司的群众运动结合起来，同心协力争取钢铁高产，有力地促进了生产的迅速增长。
    尖草坪商店是一个主要为太钢服务的大型综合商店，是山西省财贸战线上的标兵单位。今年以来，这个商店学习、推广了同家梁商店的先进经验，把原有的生产资料供应站、生活资料供应站搬到太钢附近，又新建了副食品加工站和民办代销业务管理站。为了做到送货上门，设在工地、炉旁的固定门市部和代销点，由二十一个增加到五十四个。另外还组成一百二十多人的流动服务供应队伍，经常在工地、车间流动售货。
    在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，太钢职工围绕原料、运输、设备维修三大关键展开了群众性的攻关活动，需要的生产资料的数量、品种急剧增长，需要供应的时间也更加急迫。公司党委在大抓生产的同时，又全面安排职工生活。尖草坪公社和商店党委分析了这种形势以后，认为要更及时、更有效地为钢铁生产服务，必须把太钢的生产关键当成自己的关键去解决；把工厂职工的生活当成自己的生活去安排。为此，紧密配合太钢党委的工作部署，发动和组织商店职工同太钢职工展开了热烈的竞赛。他们提出三项保证条件：（1）生产上急需的三类物资，除地方建筑材料外，五金电料、管道零件、防护用品全部包下来，千方百计保证供应；（2）从人力、物力上大力支援太钢职工集体食堂，保证工人吃好、吃省、吃得卫生，让工人经常保持充沛的干劲；（3）大抓生活服务工作，保证工人无牵无挂安心生产。这一倡议立即得到太钢职工的热烈响应。第一、二炼钢厂职工提出：保证优质、高产、安全、出勤高。运输部职工提出：保证实现多拉、快跑，给高炉供应足够的原料。为了保证竞赛条件的实现，在太钢、尖草坪商店党委领导下，成立了共同的竞赛委员会，及时组织竞赛和评比。于是店对厂、组对炉的竞赛热烈展开。
    尖草坪商店为实现竞赛条件，千方百计把供应工作赶到生产、生活需要的前边。他们抽调了三百多名职工组成了援钢供应专业队和职工经济生活专业队，分赴生产第一线和职工宿舍区，通过访生产、问生活，配合每次攻关活动提出自己的新任务。在太钢设备维修中，他们摸清了高炉、平炉、焦炉大型设备的检修时间和需要的材料数量、品种，除在本店筹集物资以外，还采取了“串连各方、共同援钢”的办法，主动同太原市百货公司等二十八个单位取得联系，共同为太钢储备备品备件。现在，这些单位在尖草坪商店的统一规划下，也都主动把商品送到现场。在组织生产资料供应的同时，商店职工还把大抓钢铁工人集体食堂，作为一项重要任务。他们对太钢七十八个职工食堂作了全面摸底，先后抽调优秀厨师四十一人，深入后进食堂，传授技术，帮助改进管理。在商店职工的帮助下，这批后进食堂一般都做到管理民主化，用粮有计划，饭、菜分量足，讲卫生，受到职工的赞扬。
    竞赛中，尖草坪商店职工在生产第一线看到钢铁工人忘我的劳动热忱，促使他们更加积极地关心职工生活，扩大服务范围。他们提出了既要当好售货员，又要当工人的“好管家”还要当好宣传鼓动员的行动口号。在太钢职工集中力量支援第二炼钢厂夺取高产的活动中，在这里流动售货的金风英小组和七号炉工人展开了炉、组竞赛。她们按工人的需要，合理供应商品，并在生产第一线代售书报杂志，代送信件，代寄包裹，代汇钱，做到了“天天到炉旁供应，一心为钢铁工人服务”，帮助七号炉工人保持了“红旗炉”的光荣称号。活跃在职工宿舍区的经济生活专业队职工，深入家属宿舍，配合家属委员会对家属代销点普遍进行了整顿，帮助健全了手续制度，改进了经营管理，大大地促进了代销人员的积极性。同时，对家属拆洗、缝补等生产服务组织，也进行了整顿巩固工作。
    由于开展竞赛，尖草坪商店职工更加主动、积极地改进服务态度，扩大货源，现在，在生产资料供应方面，他们已把五金电料、防护用品、医药卫生、杂品的供应任务全部承担起来，并且有一定数量的储备。这不仅使太钢节省出二百多个采购员，直接支援生产第一线，而且由于备品备件比较充足，缩短了平炉、高炉的大修时间。在协助太钢安排职工生活方面，全公司八十八个职工食堂，除粮食以外，蔬菜和副食品、杂货都由尖草坪商店包干供应。因此，他们被太钢职工称为生产的“好后勤”和生活的“好管家”。太钢职工在每次召开评比发奖大会的时候，都请商店职工参加，获得红旗的单位都要向商店报喜。商店的商品调运全部由太钢担当起来。
