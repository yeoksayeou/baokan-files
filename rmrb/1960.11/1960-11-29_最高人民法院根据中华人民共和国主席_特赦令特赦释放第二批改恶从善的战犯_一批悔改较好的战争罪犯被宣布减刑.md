Xinhua News Agency, November 28th. The Supreme People's Court, in accordance with the Special Pardon Order of the President of the People's Republic of China promulgated on November 19, 1960, today pardoned and released the second group of war criminals who had genuinely turned over a new leaf.

The second group of war criminals who were pardoned and released totaled fifty, including forty-five war criminals formerly belonging to the Chiang Kai-shek Group, four war criminals from the puppet Manchuria, and one war criminal from the puppet Mengjiang Autonomous Government.

The first special pardon order issued by the President of the People's Republic of China was on September 17, 1959. The Supreme People's Court implemented this order and pardoned and released the first group of thirty-three war criminals last December. The promulgation and execution of the first special pardon order demonstrated the prosperity and strength of the motherland, the unprecedented consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, and the victory of the policy of combining punishment with leniency and combining labor reform with ideological education implemented by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. It played a great encouraging role for the war criminals still in custody and further promoted their continued acceleration of reform. In the past year, some of the war criminals in custody have indeed shown signs of turning over a new leaf. Based on the recently promulgated second Special Pardon Order of the President of the People's Republic of China, the war criminal management organs of the People's Government conducted a comprehensive review of the war criminals in custody. After approval by the Supreme People's Court, it was decided to pardon and release another fifty war criminals.

The forty-five war criminals formerly belonging to the Chiang Kai-shek Group who were pardoned and released include: Li Xianzhou, Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the Second Pacification Zone of the Kuomintang; Fan Hanjie, Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Northeast "剿总" (剿匪总司令部, Bandit Suppression Headquarters) and Director of the Jinzhou Command Post; Luo Lirong, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Kuomintang Third Army; Hu Lincong, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Kuomintang Forty-First Army; Chen Jincheng, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Kuomintang Reorganized Ninety-Sixth Army; Li Yikuang, Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Fifth Army and Commander of the Independent Fiftieth Division; Song Ruike, Lieutenant General and Commander of the Kuomintang Reorganized Sixty-Sixth Division; Pang Jingtang, Member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Party Department; Shen Zui, Major General and Station Chief of the Kuomintang Secret Service Confidential Bureau Yunnan Station; Xu Changlin, Major General and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Seventy-Seventh Army; Yang Tuanyi, Major General and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Reorganized Eighty-Fourth Division; Ouyang Wu, Major General and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Sixtieth Army Provisional Fifty-Second Division; Du Yongxin, Major General and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Seventy-Second Army Two Hundred and Thirty-Third Division; Xu Wenqing, Major General and Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang Fifty-Fifth Army Forty-Fourth Division; Dong Yisan, Major General and Chief of the Second Division of the Kuomintang Fifteenth Pacification Zone Headquarters; Xia Jianji, Colonel and Commander of the Kuomintang One Hundred and Fourteenth Division; Chen Fangzhi, Colonel and Acting Commander of the Kuomintang One Hundred and Fifth Army One Hundred and Eightieth Division; Chen Qingbin, Colonel and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang Sixty-Fourth Army One Hundred and Fifty-Sixth Division; as well as other Kuomintang army officers at the rank of colonel and Kuomintang party and government personnel: Wang Youzhi, Zhang Pulin, Yang Litian, Gao Guangrong, Feng Guodian, Pang Zheng, Cong Qianzi, Li Shaotang, Li Qingyuan, Dai Lin, Feng Zhixiu, He Qingyuan, Yuan Zheng, Zhang Jingshan, Ying Ang, Xu Yupu, Sheng Zhenglin, Zhang Yingzhong, Liao Guangwu, Liu Bohua, Zou Deyu, Jiang Shixing, Liu Guansheng, Jiang Zhiwu, Ma Baomin, Wang Lunxuan, and Han Guangqi.

The four war criminals formerly belonging to the puppet Manchuria who were pardoned and released are: Jin Mingshi, Minister of the Ministry of Welfare of the puppet Manchuria; Wang Ziheng, Governor of Binjiang Province of the puppet Manchuria; Aisin-Gioro Pujie, Adjutant Military Officer of the Palace of the puppet Manchuria; and Zhengzhuerzhabu, Major General and Chief of Staff of the Tenth Military District of the puppet Manchuria.

The one war criminal formerly belonging to the puppet Mengjiang Autonomous Government who was pardoned and released is: Chen Shaowu, Major General Extra Commissioner of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense of the puppet Mengjiang Autonomous Government.

These fifty war criminals who were pardoned and released had committed serious crimes against the people in the past. During the War of Liberation, they were captured by the People's Liberation Army and have been in custody for more than ten years. During their detention, the People's Government, with a revolutionary humanitarian spirit, carried out patient education and reform work on the war criminals. Today, these war criminals who have committed serious crimes can bow their heads and admit their guilt and turn over a new leaf, once again proving the greatness and correctness of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's policy of reforming criminals.

On November 28th, the Supreme People's Court and the Higher People's Courts of relevant regions convened special pardon and release conferences in various war criminal management centers, attended by all war criminals in custody. At the conferences, the list of war criminals who were pardoned and released was announced, and they were issued special pardon notices. The war criminals who were pardoned were extremely grateful. Many expressed at the meetings that they would follow the Communist Party and continue to reform their thinking and stance, and contribute to building a socialist motherland. Some family members of war criminals were invited to attend and spoke, expressing their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for transforming their loved ones into useful people, and encouraging their loved ones to continue to strengthen their reform and serve the country.

At the special pardon and release conferences in various regions, the Supreme People's Court and the Higher People's Courts also simultaneously announced a list of war criminals who had shown better repentance and had their sentences commuted. This group of war criminals who had their sentences commuted totaled twenty-one.

    新华社28日讯　最高人民法院根据1960年11月19日公布的中华人民共和国主席特赦令，今天特赦释放了第二批确实改恶从善的战争罪犯。
    第二批被特赦释放的战争罪犯共有五十名，其中包括原属于蒋介石集团的战争罪犯四十五名，伪满洲国的战争罪犯四名，伪蒙疆自治政府的战争罪犯一名。
    中华人民共和国主席第一次发布特赦令是在1959年9月17日，最高人民法院执行了这个命令，在去年12月特赦释放了首批三十三名战争罪犯。第一次特赦令的公布和执行，显示了祖国的繁荣和强大，显示了人民民主专政的政权的空前巩固，显示了中国共产党和人民政府实行的惩办与宽大相结合、劳动改造与思想教育相结合的政策的胜利；对于尚被关押的战争罪犯起了很大的鼓励作用，进一步推动了他们继续加速改造。近一年来，在押的战争罪犯中，又有一些人确实有了改恶从善的表现。人民政府战犯管理机关根据最近第二次发布的中华人民共和国主席特赦令，对在押的战争罪犯进行了全面的审查，经过最高人民法院批准，决定再一次特赦释放五十名战争罪犯。
    被特赦释放的四十五名原属于蒋介石集团的战争罪犯，其中有：国民党第二绥靖区中将副司令官李仙洲，国民党东北“剿总”中将副司令兼锦州指挥所主任范汉杰，国民党第三军中将军长罗历戎，国民党第四十一军中将军长胡临聪，国民党整编九十六军中将军长陈金城，国民党第五军中将副军长兼独立五十师师长李以劻，国民党整编六十六师中将师长宋瑞珂，国民党中央执行委员兼山东省党部主任委员庞镜塘，国民党特务机关保密局云南站少将站长沈醉，国民党七十七军少将副军长许长林，国民党整编八十四师少将副师长杨团一，国民党六十军暂编五十二师少将副师长欧阳午，国民党七十二军二百三十三师少将副师长杜永鑫，国民党五十五军四十四师少将参谋长许文庆，国民党十五绥靖区司令部二处少将处长董益三，国民党一百一十四师上校师长夏建绩，国民党一百零五军一百八十师上校代师长陈芳芝，国民党六十四军一百五十六师上校副师长陈庆斌，以及国民党军队其他校级军官和国民党党政人员：王友直、张普霖、阳丽天、高广荣、冯国典、庞铮、丛潜滋、李绍汤、李清源、戴霖、冯志修、贺清源、袁政、张静山、应昂、徐玉璞、盛正林、张应中、廖光武、刘伯华、邹德裕、姜士行、刘冠生、蒋植五、马保民、王抡楦、韩光琦。

    被特赦释放的原属于伪蒙疆自治政府战争罪犯一名：伪蒙疆自治政府国防部二厅少将额外专员陈绍武。
    这五十名被特赦释放的战争罪犯，过去都对人民犯下了严重的罪行，在解放战争中，他们被人民解放军俘虏，关押已满十年以上。关押期间，人民政府以革命的人道主义精神，对战犯进行了耐心的教育和改造工作。今天，这些犯有严重罪行的战争罪犯能够低头认罪，改恶从善，再一次证明了中国共产党和人民政府改造罪犯政策的伟大和正确。
    11月28日，最高人民法院和有关地区的高级人民法院，分别在各战犯管理所召开了有全体在押的战争罪犯参加的特赦释放大会，会上宣布了特赦释放的战争罪犯名单，发给他们特赦通知书。被特赦的战争罪犯无不感激备至，许多人在会上表示要跟着共产党走，继续改造思想，改造立场，为建设社会主义的祖国贡献力量。有些战犯家属应邀到会并讲了话，他们衷心感激中国共产党和人民政府把他们的亲人改造成有用之人，并且勉励自己的亲人继续加强改造，报效国家。
    在各地的特赦释放大会上，最高人民法院和高级人民法院还同时宣布了一批悔改较好的被减刑的战争罪犯名单，这批被减刑的战争罪犯共有二十一名。
