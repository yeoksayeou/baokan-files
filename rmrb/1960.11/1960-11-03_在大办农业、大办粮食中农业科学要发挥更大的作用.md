After the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the instruction that the development of the national economy should be based on agriculture, a new upsurge of the whole party and the whole people engaging in agriculture and grain production is rising across the country. Under such a great situation, agricultural science workers, whose task is to develop agricultural production, should be particularly excited and inspired, and devote themselves wholeheartedly to this great struggle to develop agriculture faster and increase grain production more.

In order to highly exert their role in this struggle, agricultural science workers first need to further arm themselves ideologically, correctly understand the importance of basing the development of the national economy on agriculture and of engaging in agriculture and grain production, and correctly understand the relationship between agricultural science and agricultural production.

Agricultural science *MUST SERVE THE BASE*.  Our party's policy that agricultural science serves production profoundly points out the close relationship between agricultural science and agricultural production. Agricultural science originates from agricultural production practice and grows with the development of agricultural production. Agricultural production has always been the basic driving force for the development of agricultural science. The development of agricultural science, in turn, will promote the further development of agricultural production. The process of agricultural science development in our country fully proves this point. 1958 and 1959 were two years of great leap forward in agricultural production in our country, and also two years of great development in agricultural science. In these two years, agricultural scientific research work, centering on the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, closely cooperated with production and achieved brilliant results. The density of planting for major crops has already yielded a roughly reasonable plan. According to this plan, under the current cultivation conditions, rice should be transplanted with 20,000 to 30,000 holes per mu, wheat should be sown with 20 to 30 jin per mu, and cotton should be planted with 4,500 to 6,000 plants per mu. Two years of research have also yielded the conclusion that the general deep plowing range for large fields and that one deep plowing can be effective for about three years. In 1959, more than 1,270 varieties of improved crop seeds were selected and bred nationwide, exceeding the total number of varieties selected and bred in the more than 20 years before liberation by more than four times. Rice transplanters were developed successfully during this stage and were promoted and applied. During these two years, more than 280 kinds of agricultural science and technology books and nine substantial theoretical works such as rice, wheat, cotton, fruit tree, mulberry tree cultivation, agricultural soil, fertilizer, plant protection, and infectious animal diseases were compiled. These works summarize the advanced experience of agriculture in our country for thousands of years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, as well as the outstanding achievements in scientific research. Without the great leap forward in agricultural production, it would not have been possible for agricultural scientific research to present such an unprecedentedly prosperous scene.

Production needs also strongly influence the scale and speed of scientific development. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, the broad masses of peasants and scientific and technical personnel have formed a soil survey army of more than 7 million people. In a short period of two years, they have used both indigenous and foreign methods to preliminarily complete the soil survey and identification of 1.6 billion mu of cultivated land nationwide, laying a scientific foundation for people's communes to plant according to soil, rotate crops rationally, and improve soil. Because the great development of production requires scientific and technological support, the agricultural science and technology team has also developed rapidly. Research institutions have been established from people's communes all the way to counties, special districts, provinces, and the central government, and the number of scientific researchers has increased by four or five times compared with the early days of liberation. A national agricultural scientific research network based on people's communes has basically taken shape.

The great practice of the great leap forward in agricultural production has also put forward many new topics and new research directions for scientific research. In the process of solving the problem of close planting, the relationship between the individual and the group emerged, and the problem of plant population physiology was raised, opening up a new field for the research of plant physiology science. In the in-depth study of field management, the law of actively promoting and appropriately controlling was discovered, thus opening up the road for the development of field management as a comprehensive science. Agricultural soil science, which mainly studies cultivated soil, was also formed during the soil survey and identification process. Because the theory of promoting and controlling the directional development of soil through human labor was established, soil science in our country has greatly advanced.

The development process of agricultural science in our country clearly shows that once agricultural science is divorced from production and the broad masses engaged in production, it will lose its vitality, become listless, and deserted. Once it is combined with production and the masses, it will be full of vitality and flourish. Resolutely implementing the policy of agricultural science serving production and combining theory with practice is the only way out for the development of agricultural science.

  Starting from the Current Local Production
Agricultural science must better serve the base, must deeply understand the characteristics of agricultural production, master the laws of agricultural production, and do everything possible to solve the scientific and technological problems in production starting from the current local production.

(1) Go deep into the front line of production and strengthen technical support

Using science and technology to support the current local production is the main method for agricultural science to serve the base, and it is also the primary task of agricultural science. Because agricultural production has strong regional and seasonal characteristics, and the production objects are constantly changing with the changes in environmental factors, this determines that agricultural science must be closely combined with field production. Agricultural science workers must frequently go deep into the front line of production, discover problems in a timely manner, solve problems, and promote the development of current production. In this year's drought resistance struggle, Shaanxi Province organized 55 scientific workers to support the drought resistance struggle, which not only made many contributions to the victory of the drought resistance struggle and solved 47 outstanding technical problems, but also achieved a great harvest of science and technology. They preliminarily mastered the systematic experience of maintaining a good harvest without rain, found some cultivation techniques for drought resistance and moisture preservation, and discovered 69 scientific topics worthy of further exploration. The example of Shaanxi Province shows that agricultural science workers must go deep into the countryside, go deep into the front line of production, and closely link with production and the masses. Only in this way can they discover problems and solve problems in production; can they apply advanced experience and scientific achievements to production, and continuously improve and enhance them. Only in this way can we solve production problems and develop science itself; solve current problems and open up the road for long-term development.

Currently, it is an important season for autumn harvesting and autumn planting. The quality of autumn work has an important impact on agricultural production. Therefore, agricultural science workers should fully recognize this urgent opportunity, and under the unified leadership of the local party committee, go deep into the front line of production, grasp every link of the current central work, and strengthen technical support, such as fertilization, irrigation, pest control, disease treatment, weed removal, and frost prevention for autumn grain and autumn vegetables; seed retention, seed selection, land preparation, fertilizer accumulation, fertilization, moisture preservation, and seedling protection in autumn harvesting and autumn planting; and the storage of livestock feed and safe wintering, etc. Provide technical measures, and assist the local party committee to study field planting and experimental planning schemes, and participate in on-site technical guidance. In technical guidance, it is necessary to go deep into the production teams or groups of the people's commune, eat, live, and work with them, and work together with the members to solve the urgent problems existing in production. The technical problems to be solved must be current, urgently needed, and conditions permitted. For example, treat the pig's coarse feed to make it clean, fine and soft, so that the pig likes to eat and is easy to digest. We should promote the good experience already available to the masses, start with indigenous methods, and never put forward some methods that currently lack conditions, or adopt some foreign methods that can only be implemented in small quantities. Even the prevention and control of livestock epidemics and crop diseases and insect pests should be taught to the people as much as possible from cleaning and hygiene, epidemic prevention and isolation, the use of local soil medicines, and many preventive measures, and the principles should be repeatedly explained clearly. As for some that must use foreign methods, it can be suggested that the higher-level party and government organs pay attention to solving them; if there is no way to solve them, bring them back for practical research. In all processes, we must grasp the spirit of seeking truth from facts.

(2) Summarize experience in a timely manner and actively complete this year's research tasks

This year's agricultural scientific research tasks in various places are formulated to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link in agriculture and pigs as the head in animal husbandry, and to address the key problems existing in production. Therefore, completing this year's research tasks is of extremely important significance for supporting current and next year's production. There are still two months until the end of the year, and this period is a decisive stage for completing this year's planned tasks. Seizing the opportunity, grasping the key points, and grasping the main attack direction are the important keys to ensuring the quality and quantity and completing the planned tasks on schedule. First of all, for the work of bases outside the institute, we must focus on summarizing the experience of high yield. This year, thousands of rural research bases have been established across the country. Most of these bases are located in representative areas and are closely combined with the local high-yield methods and high-yield areas. Summarizing the high-yield experience of the bases can provide a scientific basis for guiding the current and next year's production. When summarizing, we should not only pay attention to the high-yield experience of high-yield areas, but also pay attention to the yield increase experience of general areas and low-yield areas; we should not only summarize the general laws of the "Eight-Point Charter", but also summarize the special laws; we should not only understand the current year's situation, but also collect historical materials. The experience summarized in this way is the most practical and has the most universal guiding significance.

Indoor and experimental farms are the main places for conducting detailed theoretical research and exploratory experiments, and completing the tasks in this area is also of great significance for agricultural production. Manpower should be uniformly arranged to ensure that key tasks are completed on schedule.

While completing research tasks, summarizing and evaluating research results in a timely manner is also an important task. Evaluating research results is a link in the entire process of scientific research. It is a continuation of research and a beginning of promotion. A scientific research result must be tested and verified by production before its promotion value can be determined, and the evaluation process can improve the scientific research result a step further. This is especially true for agricultural scientific research. The experimental results of indoor and experimental farms are often relatively one-sided and must be tested by large fields to draw correct conclusions for promotion and application. Conducting a review, evaluation, and promotion of existing agricultural scientific achievements and the achievements of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement is a practical action for agricultural science to support agricultural production at present.

 (3) Run technical training courses on a large scale and deliver technology to the door

Handing over technology to the masses, arming the masses with technology, and relying on the masses themselves to solve the various problems that constantly arise in production is a mass line of the party leading agricultural science. When the masses master advanced agricultural production technology, they will greatly promote production. Handan Special District in Hebei Province has adopted the method of short-term training at the county and commune levels. From last autumn to now, more than 2.4 million people have directly and indirectly participated in technical training, thereby widely establishing grassroots research organizations in the entire region, preliminarily mastering the law of wheat irrigation, proposing yield increase measures for planting wheat in alkaline land, selecting new varieties of double-cropping corn, and solving many technical problems in production, which has strongly supported the current production. Therefore, running technical training courses on a large scale and handing over technology to the masses is an important task for agricultural science to support the current production, and it is also a fundamental measure for building agricultural science in our country. Experience in various places has proved that short-term technical training is the best way to deliver technology to the door. Its main advantages are: short time, does not delay farming time, does not affect production; teaches what is needed, easy to learn and understand; learn and use, immediate results. As long as the teaching work is done well, agricultural science can be universally rooted among the masses and bloom and bear fruit in production.
Grasp the Key Scientific and Technological Points for Increasing Production with the "Eight-Point Charter" as the Guideline

In supporting production, agricultural science should not only actively solve current problems, but also consider the needs of further development, grasp the major scientific and technological key issues with increasing grain production as the center and the "Eight-Point Charter" as the guideline, concentrate efforts, and focus on key points to prepare technically for the great development of agriculture.

  (1) Transform low-yield fields, turn low-yield into high-yield, and promote balanced yield increase

In agricultural production, turning low-yield into high-yield and achieving balanced yield increase between fields and regions is of great significance for comprehensively improving total output. There are about 460 million mu of low-yield fields with poor soil quality across the country. Two hundred million mu have been improved to varying degrees, and another 260 million mu have not been improved. Output is unstable in many disaster-prone areas, and the increase in production in many backward and poor teams is not much. The potential for increasing production in these low-yield fields and low-yield areas is very large. From 1956 to 1958, six provinces and regions, including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan, transformed more than 32 million mu of low-yield fields, and the output generally increased by three or four times. The 100,000 mu of low-yield fields transformed in Cenxi County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, had a minimum yield of 550 jin per mu and a maximum of 1,000 jin. The improvement of low-yield fields involves a series of complex technical problems, requiring support from agricultural science institutions. Experience has proved that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it and implements the "Eight-Point Charter", the output will definitely change from low to high. Farmers in our country have rich experience in transforming low-yield fields, which should be summarized, improved, and promoted. The transformation of low-yield fields will inevitably greatly increase production and develop agricultural soil science in our country, and will drive the development of related disciplines. In addition to setting up base research to summarize large-scale high-yield and high-yield production, scientific research institutions should organize forces, go deep into low-yield areas, go deep into communes and teams, set up fixed points, delve into research, find the key, and turn low-yield into high-yield, and turn poor teams into rich teams. This is a major scientific research task, especially a major political and economic task.

   (2) Expand fertilizer sources and improve fertilizer efficiency

Fertilizer is the food of grain. With fertilizer, there is a basis for increasing grain production. In order to fundamentally solve the fertilizer problem, it is necessary to implement the policy of simultaneously developing organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer, strengthen the research on the source and efficiency of organic fertilizer, and rapidly develop chemical fertilizer. Human and animal manure, mainly pig manure and urine, is the main source of organic fertilizer in our country, accounting for a large proportion of the entire farm fertilizer; however, due to improper fertilizer accumulation and preservation, the fertilizer efficiency is generally lost by more than half. Studying and improving fertilizer accumulation and preservation methods to keep the fertilizer efficiency above 70% can make the same amount of fertilizer play a multiple role. In terms of planting green manure, farmers in our country have rich experience. Systematically summarizing the experience of high-yield green manure and expanding green manure varieties is also an important aspect of increasing organic fertilizer. Bacterial and algal fertilizers have great development prospects and should also be actively explored, tested and promoted. In terms of chemical fertilizers, we should study the production methods of chemical fertilizers mainly based on nitrogen fertilizer, use various domestic resources, adopt multiple paths and methods, explore simple and small-scale synthesis technologies, and expand nitrogen fertilizer production.

  (3) Summarize intercropping and relay cropping experience, expand the multiple cropping index, and strive for multiple harvests a year

Expanding the multiple cropping index, implementing intercropping and relay cropping, and striving for multiple harvests a year are of great significance for increasing grain production. In terms of sown area, this is an expansion of area; in terms of unit area, it is an increase in unit yield. This is an important method to exert the role of "good timing" and "favorable location." The agricultural geographical conditions in our country are quite superior. In the northern regions with a frost-free period of about five months a year, many places use intercropping and relay cropping methods to change from one crop a year to two crops a year, or even five crops in two years; in the southern regions with a frost-free period of more than seven or eight months, three crops a year is even more common, and some have even more. Last year, Bobai County, Guangxi, changed from two crops a year to three crops, and the multiple cropping index of paddy fields reached 257.3%, with an average yield exceeding 800 jin per mu. Intercropping and relay cropping can not only increase the multiple cropping index, but also make full use of light energy and cultivate soil fertility. According to the intercropping experiment of soybeans and corn in Taikang People's Commune, Duerbert Mongolian Autonomous County, Heilongjiang, the yield per mu of single-cropping corn was only 241 jin, and the yield of intercropping garlic soybeans was 584 jin for corn alone. The main reason is that soybeans added nitrogen fertilizer to the soil. Relay cropping experience is even more diverse in various places, such as millet relay cropping in wheat fields in the north, cotton relay cropping in wheat fields in the Yangtze River Basin, and vetch relay cropping in rice fields in the south, etc. Both crops have achieved increased production and income. Scientific research departments should, on the basis of quickly summarizing the experience of the masses, conduct in-depth research on the methods and theories of expanding the multiple cropping index, master the laws of the inherent relationships between tall crops and short crops, leguminous crops and gramineous crops, food crops and vegetable crops, and crops with long growth periods and crops with short growth periods in each growth stage, and propose methods and systems for local areas to increase the multiple cropping index, strive for multiple harvests a year, continuously improve the yield per unit area, and promote the development of cropping science in our country.

 (4) Grasp feed production, find substitutes for concentrated feed, and turn coarse feed into concentrated feed

Feed is the foundation for the development of animal husbandry and the hub of agricultural and animal husbandry integration. The quantity and quality of feed determine the speed of animal husbandry development. In grasping feed production, in addition to actively researching and cultivating local high-yield feed crops, how to find substitutes for concentrated feed and turn coarse feed into concentrated feed, and turn unusable things into usable feed, is an important task placed in front of agricultural scientific research departments. Concentrated feed is related to grain. For example, if a pig retains 100 jin of feed grain per year, then based on the number of 180 million heads at the end of 1959, the whole country would need to retain 18 billion jin of feed grain. According to the analysis of the nutritional components of chlorella, yeast, and chain spores by various places, it is possible to use them to replace concentrated feed. Scientific research departments should comprehensively study the technology of using these algae, bacteria, and other feeds in combination, and large-scale and simple production methods. The solution to this problem will not only have a significant effect on saving concentrated feed at present, but also have a significant impact on the development of animal husbandry. Our country is rich in feed resources, and the masses in various places have gained rich experience in using wild vegetables, weeds, leaves, rice husks, corn cobs, and other wild plants and agricultural and sideline products as feed, as well as processing and preparing coarse feed into concentrated feed. Research departments should further summarize the experience of the masses on this basis, improve and enhance it, expand feed sources, and improve the nutritional value of feed, which is also of great economic significance for accelerating the development of animal husbandry in our country.

  (5) Develop agricultural resources and expand the production field

Reclaiming land is an important way to expand the output of grain and cotton, and there are also many scientific and technological problems to be solved here. Generally speaking, the agricultural climate, soil characteristics, and suitable crops in the reclaimed areas are not very clear; for the unreclaimed areas, it is even more necessary to do a good job of technical and resource surveys in advance. Scientific research institutions should, according to the needs of the local reclamation tasks, and under the unified leadership of the local party committee, organize scientific and technological forces, go deep into the reclamation areas, carry out research, so as to stabilize and improve the output of the newly reclaimed areas, and preliminarily find out the details of the unreclaimed areas in advance. While researching and cultivating existing crops, we must also continue to explore new production resources and open up new production fields. Like the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products, edible fungi, algae, etc., have great potential and should be actively researched. Many areas have achieved great results in the utilization of wild fibers and wild oilseeds, and have discovered many economically valuable species, such as luobuma, stinging nettle, wild hemp, and bamaocao, etc. Scientific research institutions should further study those wild fibers and wild oilseeds that have development prospects in the local area, cultivate and domesticate them, orient them for cultivation, and expand the sources of fibers and oilseeds.

Agricultural science is facing a glorious and arduous task. Adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, resolutely implementing the policy of "walking on two legs" and launching mass movements on a large scale, and combining professional research with the scientific and technological activities of the broad masses, and combining the work of laboratories with rural research bases, is the key to ensuring the completion of the task. Under the current situation, it is necessary to carefully organize forces, rationally arrange manpower, and continuously improve work methods, so that current needs and long-term needs, the research of general topics and the exploration of cutting-edge technologies are organically combined, and the research of long-term problems and the exploration of cutting-edge technologies are driven by the solution of current problems. In recent years, scientific research institutions at all levels have accumulated a lot of experience in this area, which should be summarized to guide the current work. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, we must continue to hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, work diligently and steadily, advance victoriously, and give full play to the great role of agricultural science in the movement of the whole party and the whole people engaging in agriculture and grain production.

    在大办农业、大办粮食中农业科学要发挥更大的作用
    林山
    在党中央和毛主席提出国民经济的发展要以农业为基础的指示以后，一个全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的新高潮正在全国各地兴起。在这样的大好形势下，以发展农业生产为自己任务的农业科学工作者，应该格外欢欣鼓舞，全力投入这一场更快地发展农业，更多地增产粮食的伟大斗争。
    为了在这场斗争中高度地发挥自己的作用，农业科学工作者首先有必要进一步地从思想上武装起来，正确地认识国民经济的发展要以农业为基础、大办农业、大办粮食的重要意义，正确地认识农业科学和农业生产的关系。
    农业科学必须为基础服务。党的农业科学为生产服务的方针，深刻地指出了农业科学和农业生产的密切关系。农业科学产生于农业生产实践，并随着农业生产的发展而成长起来。农业生产始终是农业科学发展的基本推动力量。农业科学发展了，反过来又会促进农业生产的进一步发展。我国农业科学发展的过程充分证明了这一点。1958年和1959年是我国农业生产大跃进的两年，也是农业科学大发展的两年。在这两年中，农业科学研究工作围绕“八字宪法”，紧密配合生产，取得了辉煌的成果。主要作物的密植幅度，已经得出大体合理的方案。根据这个方案，在目前的耕作条件下，水稻每亩插秧二至三万穴，小麦每亩播种二十至三十斤，棉花每亩种植四千五百株到六千株。两年的研究又得出了一般大田的深耕范围和深耕一次可以有效三年左右的结论。1959年全国选育出农作物良种一千二百七十多种，超过解放前二十多年选育种总和的四倍多。水稻插秧机就是在这个阶段研究成功的，并且得到了推广和应用。在这两年中还编写了二百八十多种农业科学技术书籍和水稻、小麦、棉花、果树、桑树栽培学、农业土壤、肥料、植物保护、家畜传染病等九本有份量的理论著作。这些著作总结了我国几千年来，特别是大跃进以来农业的先进经验及科学研究方面的优秀成果。如果没有农业生产的大跃进，农业科学研究出现这种空前繁荣的景象是不可能的。
    生产需要还对科学发展的规模和速度给以强烈的影响。大跃进以来，在各级党委的领导下，广大农民和科学技术人员，组成七百余万人的土壤普查大军，在短短的两年内，用土洋并举的方法，初步完成了全国十六亿亩耕地的土壤普查鉴定工作，为人民公社因土种植、合理轮作、改良土壤，奠定了科学基础。由于生产的大发展要求科学技术支援，农业科学技术队伍也已有了迅速的发展。研究机构从人民公社一直到县、专区、省和中央已普遍建立起来，科学研究人员比解放初期增加了四、五倍，一个以人民公社为基础的全国农业科学研究网已经基本形成。
    农业生产大跃进的伟大实践，又为科学研究提出了许多新的课题，提出了新的研究方向。在密植问题解决的过程中，出现了个体与群体的关系，提出了植物群体生理学的问题，为植物生理科学的研究，开辟了一个新的领域。在对田间管理的深入研究中，发现了积极促进和适当控制的规律，从而为田间管理这一综合性科学的发展，开辟了道路。以耕作土壤为主要研究对象的农业土壤学，也正是在土壤普查鉴定过程中形成起来。由于确立了通过人的劳动促进和控制土壤定向发展的理论，我国土壤科学便大大地向前迈进了一步。
    我国农业科学发展过程清楚地表明：农业科学一旦脱离了生产，脱离了从事生产的广大群众，就会失去其生命力，萎靡不振，冷冷清清；一经同生产同群众结合，就会生气勃勃，万紫千红。坚决贯彻执行农业科学为生产服务、理论联系实际的方针，是发展农业科学的唯一出路。
          从当地当前的生产出发
    农业科学要更好地为基础服务，必须深刻认识农业生产的特点，掌握农业生产的规律，从当地当前的生产出发，千方百计地解决生产中的科学技术问题。
        （一）深入生产第一线，加强技术支援
    用科学技术支援当地当前生产，是农业科学为基础服务的主要方法，也是农业科学的首要任务。由于农业生产具有强烈的地域性和季节性，生产对象随着环境因素的变化而不断变化着，这就决定了农业科学必须和大田生产紧密结合起来。农业科学工作者必须经常地深入生产第一线，及时发现问题，解决问题，促进当前生产的发展。在今年抗旱斗争中，陕西省组织了五十五个科学工作者，支援抗旱斗争，不但为抗旱斗争胜利作出了许多贡献，解决了四十七个突出的技术问题，而且又获得科学技术的大丰收。他们初步掌握了无雨保丰收的系统经验，找出了一些抗旱保墒的耕作技术，发现了六十九个值得进一步探索的科学课题。陕西省的例子说明了农业科学工作者必须深入农村，深入生产第一线，密切联系生产、联系群众。这样才能在生产中发现问题，解决问题；才能把先进经验、科学成就运用到生产中去，并使之不断改进和提高。这样才能既解决了生产问题，又发展了科学本身；既解决了当前问题，又为长远发展开辟了道路。
    目前，正是秋收、秋种的重要季节。秋季工作的好坏对农业生产有着重要的影响，因此，农业科学工作者应当充分认识这一紧急时机，在当地党委统一领导下，深入生产第一线，抓住当前每项中心工作的各个环节，加强技术支援，如对秋粮、秋菜的施肥、灌溉、灭虫、治病、除草、防霜，秋收、秋种中的留种、选种、整地、积肥、施肥、保墒、保苗，家畜饲料的贮备和安全越冬等等，提出技术措施，并协助当地党委研究田间种植和试验规划方案，参加现场技术指导。在技术指导中，必须深入人民公社的生产队或小组，与他们同吃、同住、同劳动，就生产上存在的迫切问题，与社员一道协力解决。要解决的技术问题，必须是当前的、迫切需要的、条件许可的。例如处理猪的粗饲料，使之清洁、细软，使猪爱吃易消化。应当推广群众已有的好经验，以土法上马，而决不可以提出一些当前缺乏条件的办法，或采用一些只能少量施行的洋办法。即使家畜疫病、作物病虫害的防治，也要尽量从清洁卫生、防疫隔离、使用当地土药以及许多预防办法教给人民群众，并反复讲清道理。至于有些非用洋法不可的，可以建议上级党、政机关注意解决；尚无办法的，带回切实研究。在一切过程中，都要掌握实事求是的精神。
    （二）及时总结经验，积极完成今年研究任务
    今年各地农业科学研究任务，是贯彻执行农业以粮为纲、畜牧业以猪为首的方针，针对生产上存在的关键问题来制定的。因此，完成今年的各项研究任务，对支援当前和明年的生产有极其重要意义。目前到年底还有两个月时间，这段时间是完成今年计划任务的一个决定性阶段。抓紧时机，抓住重点，抓住主攻方向，是保质、保量如期完成计划任务的重要关键。首先，对所外基点工作，要抓好丰产经验的总结。今年全国各地建立了成千的农村研究基点，这些基点大都设立在有代表性的地区，都是和当地丰产方、丰产片紧密结合的。总结好基点的丰产经验，就可以为指导当前和明年生产提供科学依据。在总结时既要注意丰产区的高产经验，又要注意一般地区和低产区的增产经验；既要总结“八字宪法”的一般规律，又要总结特殊规律；既要了解当年情况，又要收集历史材料。这样总结出来的经验才最切合实际、最具有普遍的指导意义。
    室内和试验场是进行细致的理论研究和探索性试验的主要场所，完成这方面的任务对农业生产同样具有重要意义。应当统一安排人力，保证重点任务按期完成。
    在完成研究任务的同时，及时总结鉴定研究成果也是一项重要工作。鉴定研究成果是科学研究整个过程中的一个环节。它是研究的继续，又是推广的开始。一项科学研究成果，必须经过生产鉴定和考验，才能确定其推广价值，而鉴定过程又能把科学研究成果提高一步。农业科学研究尤其如此。室内和试验场的试验结果往往比较片面，必须经过大田来考验，才能得出正确结论，以便推广应用。对已有的农业科学成果及技术革新和技术革命运动取得的成就，进行一次整理、鉴定、推广，是当前农业科学支援农业生产的一个实际行动。
          （三）大办技术训练，送技术上门
    把技术交给群众，用技术武装群众，依靠群众自己解决生产中不断出现的各种问题，这是党领导农业科学的一条群众路线。群众掌握了先进的农业生产技术，就会把生产大大地推进一步。河北邯郸专区采取县、社层层短期训练的办法，从去秋到现在，直接、间接参加技术训练的就达二百四十多万人次，从而在全区内广泛建立了基层研究组织，初步掌握了小麦灌水规律，提出碱地种麦的增产措施，选出双季玉米新品种，并解决了生产中许多技术问题，有力地支援了当前生产。因此，大办技术训练，把技术交给群众，是农业科学支援当前生产的重要任务，也是建设我国农业科学的根本措施。各地经验证明，短期技术训练，是把技术送上门的最好形式。它的主要优点是：时间短，不误农时，不影响生产；要什么，教什么，易学易懂；学了就用，立竿见影。只要把传授工作做好，就可以使农业科学在群众中普遍扎根，在生产上开花结果。以“八字宪法”为纲抓增产的科学技术关键
    农业科学在支援生产中不但要积极解决当前问题，还要考虑进一步发展的需要，抓住以增产粮食为中心、以“八字宪法”为纲的重大科学技术关键问题，集中力量，围攻重点，为农业大发展做好技术准备。
  （一）改造低产田，变低产为高产，促进均衡增产
    在农业生产中，变低产为高产，实现田与田、地区与地区的均衡增产，对全面提高总产量具有重要意义。全国土质不良的低产田约有四亿六千多万亩，经过不同程度改良的有两亿亩，还有二亿六千多万亩未经改良，许多灾害常发区产量不稳定，不少生产落后的穷队增产不多，这些低产田和低产地区增产潜力是很大的。浙江、江西、福建、广东、广西、湖南等六省区，自1956年到1958年，改造了低产田三千二百多万亩，产量一般都增长三、四倍。广西僮族自治区岑溪县改造的十万亩低产田，最低亩产五百五十斤，最高达一千斤。低产田的改良存在着一系列复杂的技术问题，要求农业科学机关给以支援。经验证明，只要领导重视，贯彻执行“八字宪法”，产量肯定可以由低变高。我国农民有丰富的改造低产田的经验，应加以总结提高和推广。改造了低产田，也必然会大大丰产和发展我国农业土壤学，并带动有关学科的发展。科学研究机关除设立基点研究总结大面积丰产和高额丰产外，今后更应组织力量，深入低产区，深入社队，固定设点，深入钻研，找出关键，变低产为高产，变穷队为富队。这是一个重大的科学研究任务，尤其是一个重大的政治经济任务。
            （二）扩大肥源，提高肥效
    肥料是粮食的粮食。有了肥料，粮食的增产就有了基础。为了从根本上解决肥料问题，必须贯彻执行有机肥料和无机肥料同时并举的方针，既要加强有机肥料的肥源和肥效的研究，也要迅速发展化学肥料。以猪粪尿为主的人畜粪便是我国主要的有机肥源，在整个农家肥料中占很大比重；但由于积肥、保肥不当，肥效一般损失一半以上。研究改进积肥、保肥方法，把肥效保持在70％以上，就可以使同等数量的肥料发挥成倍的作用。在种植绿肥方面，我国农民具有丰富的经验。系统总结绿肥丰产经验，扩大绿肥品种，也是增加有机肥料的一个重要方面。菌藻肥料有很大发展前途，也应积极探索、试验和推广。在化学肥料方面，应当研究以氮肥为主的化肥生产方法，利用各种国产资源，采取多种道路、多种方法，探索简易的小型合成技术，扩大氮肥生产。
      （三）总结间作套种经验，扩大复种指数，
                争取一年多熟
    扩大复种指数，实行间作套种，争取一年多熟，对增产粮食具有重大意义。就播种面积来说，这是面积的扩大；按单位面积来说，又是单位产量的提高。这是一个发挥“天时”、“地利”作用的重要方法。我国农业地理条件相当优越，在一年无霜期五个月左右的北方地区，很多地方采用间作套种方法，变一年一熟为一年二熟，甚至二年五熟；无霜期在七、八个月以上的南方地区，一年三熟更是常见，有的还更多。广西博白县去年变一年两熟为三熟，水田复种指数达到257.3％，平均亩产超过八百斤。间作套种不仅可以提高复种指数，而且可以充分利用光能，培养地力。根据黑龙江杜尔伯特蒙古族自治县太康人民公社的大豆和玉米间作试验，单种玉米的亩产只二百四十一斤，间作的大蒜大豆，光是玉米每亩就收五百八十四斤，主要原因是由于大豆给土壤增加了氮肥。套种经验，各地更加丰富多采，如北方麦田套种谷子，长江流域麦田套种棉花，南方稻田套种苕子等等，两种作物都获得增产增收。科学研究部门应在迅速总结群众经验的基础上，深入研究扩大复种指数的方法和理论，掌握高秆作物和低秆作物、豆科作物和禾本科作物、粮食作物和蔬菜作物、生长期长的作物和生长期短的作物在各个生育阶段相互间内在关系的规律，提出当地提高复种指数的方法和制度，争取一年多熟，不断提高单位面积产量，并促进我国耕作学的发展。
  （四）大抓饲料，寻找精料代用品，变粗料为精料
    饲料是发展畜牧业的基础，也是农牧结合的枢纽。饲料的多寡和质量的好坏，决定着畜牧业发展的速度。在大抓饲料中，除积极研究和培育当地高产饲料作物外，如何寻找精料代用品，变粗料为精料，把不可利用的东西变为可利用的饲料，这是摆在农业科学研究部门面前的一个重要任务。精料是同粮食关联着的，如一头猪一年留一百斤饲料用粮，则全国按1959年底存栏头数一亿八千万头计算，就要留饲料用粮一百八十亿斤。根据各地对小球藻、酵母菌和链胞霉等营养成分的分析，用它们来代替精料是有可能的。科学研究部门应综合研究这些藻、菌类和其他饲料搭配使用的技术和大规模简便的生产方法。这个问题的解决，不只对当前节省精料将有重大作用，对畜牧业的发展也将起重大影响。我国饲料资源丰富，各地群众在利用野菜、野草、树叶、稻壳、玉米轴等野生植物和农副产品作饲料，以及把粗料加工调制成精料等方面，均取得了丰富的经验。研究部门在这个基础上进一步总结群众经验，加以改进提高，扩大饲料来源，提高饲料营养价值，这对加速发展我国畜牧业也有着重大的经济意义。
        （五）开辟农业资源，扩大生产领域
    开垦土地是扩大粮食和棉花产量的一个重要途径，这里面也存在着许多待解决的科学技术问题。一般来说，对于开垦地区的农业气候、土壤特性、适种作物，都还不十分清楚；对于未垦区，更需要预先做好技术和资源调查工作。科学研究机关应根据当地垦殖任务的需要，在当地党委统一领导下，组织科学技术力量，深入垦区，开展研究，以便稳定提高新垦区的产量，并预先摸清未垦区的底细。在研究培育现有农作物的同时，还要不断探索新的生产资源，开辟新的生产领域。像农副产品的综合利用，食用菌藻类等，很有潜力，应当积极研究。许多地区野生纤维和野生油料的利用方面，取得了很大成绩，从中发现了许多有经济价值的种类，如罗布麻、螫麻、野生麻和巴茅草等等。科学研究机关应当进一步研究那些对当地具有发展前途的野生纤维和野生油料，加以栽培驯化，定向培育，扩大纤维和油料来源。
    农业科学正面临着一个光荣而艰巨的任务。坚持政治挂帅，坚决贯彻执行“两条腿走路”、大搞群众运动的方针，实行专业研究和广大群众科学技术活动相结合，实验室的工作和农村研究基点相结合，是保证完成任务的关键。在当前形势下，必须周密组织力量，合理安排人力，不断改进工作方法，使当前需要和长远需要，一般课题的研究和尖端技术的探索有机结合起来，通过当前问题的解决，带动长远问题的研究和尖端技术的探索。几年来，各级科学研究机关在这方面积累了许多经验，应加以总结，指导当前工作。我们要在党和毛泽东同志领导下，继续高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，勤勤恳恳，踏踏实实，乘胜前进，在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的运动中，发挥农业科学的巨大作用。
