In celebrating the eleventh anniversary of our country, the Chinese Science and Technology Cooperation Delegation visited heroic Albania to participate in the Fifth Meeting of the Sino-Albanian Technical Cooperation Joint Committee. As soon as we set foot on the land of the heroic people, we were deeply moved by the sincere brotherly affection. The Albanian Labor Party's organizations at all levels, the government, and the people warmly welcomed the delegation as if they were receiving their own relatives. Everywhere was filled with love for the new China and deep friendship for the Chinese people. During the visit, Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, and Comrade Spiro Koleka, Acting Chairman of the Council of Ministers, received the delegation and held cordial talks.

On the evening of September 30th, the delegation attended the National Day reception held by Ambassador Luo Shigao, where they met Comrade Enver Hoxha and other leaders of the Albanian Labor Party. Comrade Hoxha spoke at the reception. He warmly praised China's socialist construction achievements, praised the great contributions made by the new China in the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace, and praised the correct, principled, and unwavering struggle waged by the Chinese Communist Party to defend the purity of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and to oppose modern revisionism. His speech was filled with a strong fighting spirit against imperialism and modern revisionism, filled with deep friendship for the Chinese people, and filled with enthusiastic and resolute support for the new China.

The Working Class's High Labor Enthusiasm

The delegation's visit to Albania covered the entire country, from the Durrës region on the western Adriatic coast to the Peshkopi region on the eastern frontier, from the famous Shkodër region in the north to the Sarandë region in the south. Throughout the thirteen regions, we visited many agricultural production cooperatives, state farms, hydroelectric power stations, factories, mines, schools, and hospitals. We witnessed with our own eyes the fundamental changes in Albania's backwardness left over from the old society, and a new type of advanced agricultural-industrial country is advancing at a flying speed. The tremendous achievements of the Albanian people in building socialism under the correct leadership of the Labor Party left us with a deep and unforgettable impression.

Before liberation, Albania's total industrial output value in 1938 accounted for only 9.8% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. After liberation, modern factories, power stations, and mines were established one after another. The total industrial output value in 1959 increased by 21.8 times compared with 1938. The total industrial output value is almost half of the country's total output value. The industrial output value of fifteen days is now equivalent to the entire year of 1938. The amount of construction in nine days, the amount of road transportation in twelve days, and the amount of maritime transportation in two days are all equal to the total amount for the entire year of 1938. We visited the Stalin Oil United Factory and the Karl Marx Hydropower Station. The power generated by this power station in just a few days is more than the total power generated in the entire country in 1944. In another place, the Albanian government is building a second large hydroelectric power station, which is planned to be completed in two years. We also visited the Pishkash iron-nickel mine, the cigarette factory in the Shkodër region, the knitting factory in the Korçë region, as well as canning factories, wineries, and other modern enterprises. Everywhere we went, we saw the diligent, brave, and intelligent Albanian working class building its own glorious future with high labor enthusiasm.

The Great Superiority of Agricultural Cooperativization

The delegation focused on visiting agricultural production cooperatives and state farms. Comrade Iljas Reka, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of Albania, and Comrade Jorka, Director of the Propaganda Department, introduced the agricultural situation to us in detail.

Before liberation, feudal landlords, rich peasants, capitalists, and religious communities occupied the vast majority of the land in Albania. There were only thirty-five fifteen-horsepower tractors in the country. The country's most fertile basins were full of swamps. There were basically no water conservancy projects, and they were often subjected to droughts and floods. Crop yields were very low, and the people lived a poor, hungry, and miserable life. After liberation, the Labor Party led the peasants in land reform, and 70,000 peasant households were distributed 170,000 hectares of land, 470,000 olive trees, and more than 5,900 heads of livestock. Subsequently, under the leadership of the Labor Party, they embarked on the road of cooperativization. By 1959, cooperativization was completed one year ahead of schedule, and the cultivated land owned by socialist agriculture accounted for more than 85% of the country's cultivated land. Now the number of tractors has increased to 4,280 standard units, and 70% of agricultural operations and 45% of cultivated land have been mechanized. The number of tractors per thousand hectares of cultivated land is more than that of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey. The cultivated area has increased by 57% compared with 1938. During the Second Five-Year Plan alone, more than 70,000 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed. Great importance is attached to small-scale water conservancy and organic fertilizers. We saw many manure storage pools and wells, some of which were being used for irrigation. In 1938, the national irrigation area was only 29,000 hectares, but in 1959 it reached 135,000 hectares, accounting for 27% of the cultivated land. The state has undertaken eight large-scale soil improvement projects, investing billions of lek and transforming tens of thousands of hectares of swamps into fertile fields. Many large-scale mechanized state farms with high commodity rates have been established on those former swamps. The Maliq and Urg State Farms we visited were both established on former swamps. The Maliq Farm has 4,600 hectares of cultivated land. In 1959, wheat yielded 2.6 tons per hectare and sugar beets yielded 32 tons per hectare. The entire farm made a profit of 92 million lek. A modern sugar factory and a beautiful workers' city have also been built near the farm. The citrus branch of the Urg Farm planted citrus fruits introduced from Jinjiang, Fujian and Jiangjin, Sichuan, China. The Jinjiang citrus fruits began to bear 50 to 60 fruits per plant two years after planting.

Due to the great superiority of agricultural cooperativization, due to a series of correct policies and technical measures adopted by the Albanian Labor Party and the government, Albania's agricultural production has greatly increased. Compared with 1959 and 1938, the total agricultural output value has increased by nearly 100%, and the growth rate has greatly exceeded that of Italy, Greece, and Yugoslavia. Grain increased by 72.6%, cotton increased by 140 times, tobacco increased by nearly 6 times, and meat increased by nearly 50%. The number of various livestock generally exceeded the 1938 level. The production of olive, grape, apple, citrus and other fruit trees and vegetables has also made great progress. From 1956 to 1960, during the Second Five-Year Plan, although natural disasters were encountered continuously, especially this year's drought, it did not rain for four months from May to September, the losses from natural disasters were greatly reduced due to the great efforts of the vast number of cooperative members under the leadership of the Labor Party. The total output value during the Second Five-Year Plan still increased by 28.7% compared with the First Five-Year Plan. In southern Italy's arid regions, which have similar natural conditions and roughly the same disaster situation, most wheat fields have no harvest this year.

During our visit, we saw everywhere the creative labor carried out by the vast number of Albanian peasants to consolidate the cooperative system and develop agricultural production. Now, a mass movement to strive for 300 workdays per person has been launched throughout the Albanian countryside. The Albanian-Chinese Friendship Cooperative in the Berat region has 620 laborers, and by mid-October, 400 people had completed the plan of 300 workdays ahead of schedule. In order to further consolidate and improve the agricultural production cooperatives, a movement to merge small cooperatives into large cooperatives is now being actively and steadily carried out in the Albanian countryside. Among the existing 1,620 agricultural production cooperatives, 270 large cooperatives have been formed by merging more than 600 small cooperatives, each large cooperative has more than 500 hectares of cultivated land, and the largest cooperative in the country has 2,000 hectares of cultivated land. The Party has sent a large number of strong cadres to strengthen the leadership of the large cooperatives. Many district committee secretaries have become directors of the large cooperatives, and the Deputy Director of the Tractor Station Administration Bureau of the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture has also been sent to become the director of a large cooperative in Himara. The large cooperatives have played a greater superiority in production, and several large cooperatives have established public bakeries, kindergartens, and nurseries during busy farming seasons, and also issued pensions to elderly cooperative members.

The agricultural cooperative system has brought a happy life to the cooperative members. The Albanian-Chinese Friendship Cooperative in the Shkodër region that we visited paid 45 lek and 2.2 kilograms of grain per workday last year. This year it can be increased to 60 lek and 3 kilograms of grain. The Spark Cooperative in the Elbasan region, which mainly grows tobacco, pays 190 lek per workday this year (including 2 kilograms of grain). The average income per cooperative member is 20,000 lek. Since 1956, 85 new houses have been built by the 247 cooperative member households. Cooperative members own 72 radios. The Red Star Cooperative in the Korçë region has built more than 100 new houses. Almost all the houses in one village are newly built.

Albania has adopted many effective measures to lead agricultural production. Each of the central responsible comrades is directly in charge of a region, contracting by region. Leading cadres at all levels plant experimental fields, and leading production with production has become a system. Comrade Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, participated in a month of physical labor at the Solux Farm near Tirana last year, driving a tractor with the farm workers, helping the farm leaders to study and improve their work in labor, and completely integrating with the workers in life. His 7-hectare experimental cornfield yielded 8.6 tons per hectare, which gave great inspiration and encouragement to the vast number of peasants and cadres across the country. Wherever we went, whether it was a district, a farm, or a cooperative, there were high-yield experimental fields. The yield of the experimental fields was generally one to several times higher than that of ordinary large fields. The masses praised planting experimental fields as "opening their eyes," "believing in the potential for increased production," and "finding the key to increased production."

Brilliant Achievements in Culture and Education

Albania has also made brilliant achievements in culture and education. Compared with 1938, the number of schools has increased by 2.3 times, and the number of students has increased by 3.2 times. The number of teachers has increased fourfold. Primary compulsory education has been implemented throughout the country, and every village has a seven-year school. Illiteracy among people under the age of 40 has been eliminated. One in every six people in the country is studying in a regular school. The number of students per thousand residents is more than that of Greece, Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. The country trains an average of 350 cadres with higher education degrees every year, which is equal to the total number of people who received higher education during the entire reign of the Zog regime (Albania's feudal king from 1924 to 1939). The Tirana Agricultural College that we visited has trained 267 agronomists, 135 animal husbandry technicians, and 113 veterinarians for the country. The school attaches great importance to the combination of education and productive labor. Among the students enrolled in the Agricultural College, 70% have participated in three years of productive labor after graduating from middle school.

During our visit, the people in Albania's urban and rural areas were enthusiastically discussing the Labor Party's draft instructions on the Third Five-Year Plan. This magnificent program further mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. The people are welcoming their 16th National Day and the Party's Fourth Congress with a boiling labor competition.

Opposing Imperialism and Modern Revisionism

The speed of development and brilliant achievements of Albania's socialist construction have left the surrounding capitalist countries and Yugoslavia under the rule of the Tito traitor clique far behind. Albania, surrounded by capitalist countries, has proved the incomparable superiority of the socialist system with irrefutable facts. Albania is located on the southwestern outpost against imperialism and modern revisionism, and has carried out a strong and unyielding struggle against the enemy. The glorious achievements of the Albanian people have aroused the hatred of imperialism and modern revisionism. They regard Albania as a thorn in their side, and try their best to sabotage it, using methods such as sending special agents and spies, organizing counter-revolutionary activities, spreading rumors and slanders, and openly provoking, in an attempt to subvert the Albanian people's regime. However, all of this cannot frighten the heroic Albanian people under the leadership of the glorious Albanian Labor Party. They stand strong in the encirclement of the enemy, and under the teaching of Comrade Hoxha to "hold a pick in one hand and a gun in the other," the entire people are armed, building while fighting. The person in charge of the Pogradec District Committee said that in their district, as long as three hand grenades are fired, 3,000 people can be gathered immediately. The saying "Water can sleep, but the enemy will not sleep" is circulating everywhere among the people, which shows how vigilantly the Albanian people are guarding their motherland. The special agents and spies sent by the enemy are mostly captured by the militia. In 1953, 120 armed subversion groups sent by the Tito traitor clique were cracked, and in 1955, hundreds of bandits sent by the Tito traitor clique were cracked again. A few days before the delegation's arrival, a car driver cleverly captured two special agents sent by the Yugoslav Tito traitor clique. When the delegation visited the Peshkopi region on the northeastern border of Albania, they asked a child how far Yugoslavia was from here. The child replied without hesitation: "Beyond the mountain is revisionism, and the top of the mountain is the boundary between us and revisionism." The issue is very clear. In the face of the heroic Albanian Labor Party and people, all the despicable conspiracies and sabotage activities of imperialism and modern revisionism are bound to be shamefully defeated.

The Albanian Labor Party and people have always resolutely opposed the aggressive and war policies of imperialism headed by the United States, and have always adhered to the principle of proletarian internationalism. In order to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, they have waged a tenacious and irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionists represented by the Yugoslav Tito traitor clique. In these struggles, the Albanian Labor Party and people have shown the fearless heroic spirit of not being afraid of violence, not being afraid of difficulties, and forging ahead bravely, which has left us with a very deep impression. In the contacts between the delegation and the Albanian leading comrades and the masses, they all talked about: "The nature of imperialism will not change," "Wolf fur is easy to change, but the wolf's nature is difficult to change," "Jackals will not become sheep," "The closer the enemy is to death, the more we must be vigilant and strengthen the struggle," "Revisionism is a product of imperialism and the bourgeoisie, and its only task is to oppose socialism and communism in every possible way," "Our people know what revisionism is because they have personally tried it," "It is now more necessary than ever to oppose revisionism." Comrade Koleka said when receiving the delegation: "Peace cannot be begged for, we must stand up, straighten our backs, and fight," "If imperialism dares to launch a war, we will eliminate it." Chairman Lleshi said when receiving the delegation: "In order to oppose imperialism, oppose modern revisionism, and all those who want to destroy the cause of communism, our Party and our people will not hesitate to sacrifice everything." "No matter what the difficult circumstances, we must hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and move forward." "No force, no reason, can make us deviate from this path." "We stand firmly in the encirclement of the enemy because we have mastered the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism can enable us to overcome all difficulties." Under the teachings of the Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, the Albanian people deeply understand that the struggle against imperialism and its lackeys, modern revisionism, is closely linked to the struggle for peace, the construction of socialism, the defense of the motherland's freedom and independence, and the consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp. The Albanian Labor Party is a fighting Marxist-Leninist party that has been tempered in the heat of struggle and has close ties with the people. The Albanian people love the Labor Party and love the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Hoxha.

Brotherly Friendship Between the Chinese and Albanian People

The deep friendship shown by the Albanian leaders at all levels and the broad masses of the people towards the Chinese people when receiving the delegation is unforgettable for a lifetime. Every one of our comrades also felt honored and happy to be able to spend twenty days of fighting alongside the Albanian brothers. The Albanian Labor Party and people's high evaluation of our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, of the achievements of the Chinese people, and their warm support for the three red flags of our Party's General Line, Great Leap Forward, and People's Commune, have given us great encouragement. We deeply feel that common ideals, common goals, and a common cause have closely linked the people of China and Albania in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. This friendship cannot be destroyed by any enemy. When we visited the Peshkopi region on the northeastern border of Albania, which borders Yugoslavia, the local people lined the streets to welcome the delegation. The District Committee invited us and Chairman Lleshi to participate in the naming ceremony of the agricultural production cooperative named after Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of all ethnic groups in China. The chairman of the cooperative, following the Albanian national tradition, welcomed the delegation with bread and salt, accompanied by a band composed of cooperative members. The chairman, on behalf of all cooperative members, expressed that they "feel infinitely happy to be named after the great Marxist-Leninist and the genius of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong." Chairman Lleshi warmly praised the achievements of the new China and instructed the cooperative to strive for greater achievements and live up to this great name. When visiting the New China Cooperative in the Tirana region, the cooperative held a mass meeting to welcome the delegation and performed national songs and dances for us. In the Berat region near Mount Tomorr, the delegation visited the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Cooperative. The cooperative members wore festive national costumes and welcomed the delegation by playing musical instruments, and performed rich and colorful cultural programs for the delegation. On the way from the Pogradec region to the Elbasan region, we passed through the Librazhd region. It was not arranged to visit the region, but the Second Secretary of the District Committee and the responsible comrades of the District People's Committee chased the delegation in a jeep and warmly invited us to visit their region. After the delegation accepted the invitation and visited, when we bid farewell, the leaders of the District Committee and the District People's Committee accompanied us to the boundary of the region before bidding farewell reluctantly. On the way from Comrade Hoxha's hometown, Gjirokastër, to Berat, there was an agricultural cooperative called Holta. Hearing that the delegation was going to pass by the road near their cooperative, although it was already past 9 p.m. and the night had enveloped the mountains, the chairman of the cooperative and a dozen cooperative members waited by the roadside with various wines and fresh grapes, walnut kernels, and other foods, in order to express their best wishes to the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the members of the People's Commune on behalf of all cooperative members. All of these are just a small part of the countless moving and friendly events we encountered during our visit. Just this small part of the facts is enough to show how much the Albanian people love the new China, love the Chinese Communist Party, and love the Chinese people. As the Chairman of the People's Committee of the Berat region said: "We are close friends, comrades, and brothers. We have inseparable ties of flesh and blood. Marxism-Leninism has closely united us together, united like one person. Our friendship is as solid as Mount Tomorr (the most majestic and magnificent mountain in Albania, which symbolizes the Albanian people's staunch struggle against foreign aggression), and no force can shake it."

Today, on the glorious day of the 16th anniversary of Albania's founding, we are even more reminded of the deep brotherly friendship during our visit to Albania. We congratulate the Albanian people on the great achievements they have made in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, wish Albania's socialist construction to develop further, and wish the friendship between the people of China and Albania to last forever.

    在阿尔巴尼亚的日子
    刘瑞龙
    在我国欢庆建国十一周年的时候，中国科学技术合作代表团，曾到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，参加中阿技术合作联合委员会第五次会议。当我们一踏上英雄人民国土的时候，就被真诚的兄弟情谊所深深感动。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党各级组织、政府和人民群众，像接待亲人一样热情地欢迎代表团。到处洋溢着对新中国的热爱和对中国人民的深厚友情。在访问期间，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希同志和部长会议代理主席科列加同志都接见了代表团并进行了亲切的谈话。
    9月30日晚，代表团参加了罗士高大使举行的我国国庆招待会，会上见到了霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的其他领导同志。霍查同志在招待会上讲了话。他热情地赞扬我国社会主义建设成就，赞扬新中国在反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的斗争中所作的巨大贡献，赞扬中国共产党为保卫马克思列宁主义原则的纯洁性，为反对现代修正主义而进行的正确的有原则的毫不动摇的斗争。他的讲话，充满了反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的坚强战斗精神，充满了对于中国人民的深厚友情，充满了对新中国热情而坚决有力的支持。
  工人阶级的高度劳动热情
    代表团在阿尔巴尼亚的访问，遍及全国各地，从西部亚得里亚海滨都拉斯区到东部边疆的佩什科比区，从北部闻名的斯库台区到南方的萨兰达区。在纵横十三个地区内，我们参观了许多农业生产合作社、国营农场、水电站、工厂、矿山、学校和医院。我们亲眼看到在阿尔巴尼亚旧社会遗留下来的落后面貌被根本改变了，一个新型的先进的农业—工业国，以飞跃的速度前进着。阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党正确领导下建设社会主义的巨大成就，给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。
    阿尔巴尼亚在解放前，1938年的工业总产值仅占工农业总产值的9.8％。解放后，现代化的工厂、电站和矿山一个个相继建立起来。1959年的工业总产值就比1938年增加了二十一点八倍。工业总产值几乎达到全国总产值的一半。现在十五天的工业产值就相当于1938年全年的产值。九天的建筑量，十二天的公路运输量，二天的海上运输量都等于1938年全年的总量。我们参观了斯大林石油联合工厂，也参观了卡尔·马克思水电站，单是这个发电站几天的发电量就比1944年全国发电总量还要多。在另一个地方，阿尔巴尼亚政府又在兴建第二个大水电站，计划两年完工。我们还参观了皮什卡什铁镍矿、斯库台区的卷烟厂、科尔察区的针织厂，以及罐头厂、葡萄酒厂等现代化企业，每到一地，都看到了勤劳、勇敢、智慧的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级以高度的劳动热情建设着自己的光辉未来。
    农业合作化的巨大优越性
    代表团着重访问了农业生产合作社和国营农场。阿尔巴尼亚农业部副部长伊利亚斯·雷卡同志和宣传司长约尔卡同志向我们详细介绍了农业情况。
    阿尔巴尼亚在解放前，封建地主、富农、资本家、宗教社团占有全国绝大部分土地，全国只有三十五台十五马力拖拉机，国家最肥沃的盆地布满了沼泽，基本上没有水利工程，经常遭受旱涝灾害，农作物产量很低，人民过着贫困、饥饿、悲惨的生活。解放后，劳动党领导农民进行了土地改革，七万农户分得了十七万公顷土地，四十七万株橄榄树，五千九百多头牲口。随后又在劳动党领导下，走上合作化的道路。到1959年提前一年完成了合作化，社会主义农业拥有的耕地占全国耕地85％以上。现在拖拉机已增加到四千二百八十个标准台，70％的农事作业和45％的耕地已经实现机械化。按每千公顷耕地所拥有的拖拉机台数计算，比南斯拉夫、希腊、土耳其都要多。耕地面积比1938年增加了57％，仅在第二个五年计划期间，就开荒七万多公顷。对小型水利、有机肥料很重视，我们看到了许多蓄粪池和水井，有的正在车水灌溉。1938年全国灌溉面积只有二万九千公顷，1959年已达到十三万五千公顷，占耕地的27％。国家举办了八个大的土壤改良工程，投资几十亿里克，成千成万公顷的沼泽地变成了良田，在那些过去的沼泽地上，建立了许多大型的机械化和商品率都很高的国营农场。我们参观的马里奇和乌尔古国营农场，都是在过去沼泽地上建立起来的。马里奇农场有四千六百公顷耕地，1959年小麦每公顷产二十六公担，甜菜每公顷产三百二十公担，全场赢利九千二百万里克。在农场附近还建立了一个现代化糖厂和一座美丽的工人城。乌尔古农场的柑桔分场种上了从中国福建晋江和四川江津引进的柑桔。晋江柑桔定植二年每株就结果五六十个。
    由于农业合作化的巨大优越性，由于阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府采取的一系列正确政策和技术措施，阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产有了巨大增长。1959年和1938年相比，农业总产值增长了将近一倍，增长速度大大超过意大利、希腊和南斯拉夫。粮食增长了72.6％，棉花增长了一百四十倍，烟叶增长了将近六倍，肉类增长将近半倍。各种牲畜头数普遍超过1938年水平。橄榄、葡萄、苹果、柑桔等果树和蔬菜生产也有了巨大的发展。从1956年到1960年第二个五年计划期间，虽然连续遇到了自然灾害，尤其是今年的旱灾，从5月到9月四个月没有下过雨，但是由于广大社员在劳动党领导下发挥了冲天干劲，大大减轻了自然灾害的损失。第二个五年计划期间的总产值仍比第一个五年计划期间增长28.7％。而自然条件相似，灾害情况也大体相同的意大利南部干旱地区，今年大部分麦田没有收成。
    我们在访问中，到处都看到阿尔巴尼亚广大农民为了巩固合作社制度，为了发展农业生产所进行的创造性劳动。现在，全阿尔巴尼亚农村中普遍展开了每人争取作三百个劳动日的群众运动。培拉特区阿中友好社有六百二十个劳动力，到10月中旬已经有四百人提前完成了三百个劳动日的计划。为了使农业生产合作社进一步巩固和提高，现在，阿尔巴尼亚农村中正在积极而又稳步开展着小社并大社的运动，现有一千六百二十个农业生产合作社中，已经有二百七十个大社，是由六百多个小社并成的，每个大社有五百多公顷耕地，全国最大的社有二千公顷耕地。党派了大批坚强的干部去加强大社领导，许多区委书记到大社当社长，阿尔巴尼亚农业部拖拉机站管理局副局长也被派到赫马拉一个大社当社长。大社在生产上发挥了更大的优越性，并有若干大社举办了公共面包房、幼儿园、农忙托儿所，还给老年社员发了养老金。
    农业合作社制度给社员带来了幸福的生活。我们访问的斯库台区阿中友好社，去年每个劳动日报酬是四十五个里克、二点二公斤粮食，今年可增加到六十个里克、三公斤粮食。爱尔巴桑区火花社，以种烟叶为主，今年每个劳动日报酬是一百九十里克（包括二公斤粮食），社员每人平均收入二万里克，从1956年到现在，全社二百四十七户社员盖起了八十五幢新房，社员有七十二架收音机。科尔察区红星社，社员建新房一百多幢，有一个村的房子，几乎都是新盖的。
    阿尔巴尼亚对农业生产领导采取了许多行之有效的措施。中央负责同志每人直接领导一个区，分区包干。各级领导干部都种试验田，以生产领导生产，成为一种制度。部长会议主席谢胡同志，去年曾在地拉那附近的索鲁克斯农场，参加一个月的体力劳动，和农场工人一块开拖拉机，在劳动中帮助农场领导研究改进工作，生活上和工人完全打成一片。他所负责的七公顷玉米试验田，每公顷产量八十六公担，给全国广大农民和干部极大的启发和鼓舞。我们所到的地方，不论是区、场、社都有高产试验田，试验田的产量一般要比普通大田的产量高一倍到几倍。广大群众夸奖种试验田是“打开了眼界”，“相信了增产潜力”，“找到了增产的钥匙”。
    文化教育的辉煌成就
    阿尔巴尼亚在文化教育方面也取得了辉煌成就。现在和1938年相比，学校增加了二点三倍，学生人数增加了三点二倍。教员人数增加了四倍。全国实行了初级义务教育，每个乡村都有七年制学校，四十岁以下的文盲已经扫除。全国每六个人中就有一个人在正规学校中学习。按每一千个居民中的学生数量来说，比希腊、意大利、土耳其、南斯拉夫都要多。全国每年平均培养三百五十名具有高等教育程度的干部，等于索古（1924年至1939年阿尔巴尼亚的封建国王）制度整个统治时期受过高等教育人数的总和。我们参观的地拉那农学院，已为国家培养了二百六十七名农学家，一百三十五名畜牧技师，一百一十三名兽医。学校很重视教育和生产劳动相结合，农学院所招收的学生中，70％是中学毕业后参加过三年生产劳动的。
    在我们访问期间，阿尔巴尼亚城乡人民都在热烈讨论劳动党的关于第三个五年计划的指示草案，这个宏伟的纲领，把广大人民的积极性进一步调动起来，人民以沸腾的劳动竞赛来迎接自己的国庆十六周年和党的第四次代表大会。反对帝国主义和现代修正主义
    阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设发展速度和光辉成就，把周围的资本主义国家以及铁托叛徒集团统治下的南斯拉夫，远远地抛在后边。在资本主义国家包围中的阿尔巴尼亚用无可辩驳的事实，证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。阿尔巴尼亚处在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的西南前哨，对敌人进行了坚强的不屈不挠的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民的光辉成就引起了帝国主义和现代修正主义的仇恨，他们把阿尔巴尼亚看做眼中钉，千方百计地进行破坏，采用派遣特务间谍、组织反革命活动、造谣、诽谤和公开挑衅等办法，企图颠复阿尔巴尼亚人民政权。但是，所有这一切，都吓不倒在光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民。他们在敌人包围中坚强地屹立着，在霍查同志“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的教导下，全国人民都武装起来，一边建设，一边战斗。波格拉迪茨的区委负责同志说，在他们区里，只要打三颗手榴弹，马上就可以集合起三千人。全国民间到处流传着“水可以睡觉，敌人不会睡觉”的话，由此可见阿尔巴尼亚人民是怎样警惕地保卫着祖国。敌人派遣的特务间谍，大都被民兵捕获。1953年破获了铁托叛徒集团派来的一百二十个武装颠复小组，1955年又破获了铁托叛徒集团派来的几百名匪徒。在代表团抵达的前几天，曾经有一个汽车司机机智地活捉了两名南斯拉夫铁托叛徒集团派遣的特务。代表团访问阿尔巴尼亚东北边境佩什科比区时，问一个小孩，南斯拉夫离这里多远？小孩毫不迟疑地回答说：“过了山就是修正主义，山顶上就是我们和修正主义的分界线”。问题十分明显，在英雄的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民面前，帝国主义和现代修正主义的一切卑鄙阴谋和破坏活动，都必定遭到最可耻的失败。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民，一贯坚决地反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，一贯坚持无产阶级的国际主义原则，为了捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，同以南斯拉夫铁托叛徒集团为代表的现代修正主义者进行了顽强的毫不调和的斗争。在这些斗争中，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民表现了不畏强暴，不怕困难，勇往直前的大无畏的英雄气概，给我们留下了极深刻的印象。代表团和阿尔巴尼亚领导同志以及人民群众接触中，他们都谈到：“帝国主义本性是不会变的”，“狼毛易变，狼性难改”，“豺狼不会变成绵羊”，“敌人越是接近死亡，我们越要提高警惕，加强斗争”，“修正主义是帝国主义和资产阶级的产物，它的任务只有一个，就是千方百计来反对社会主义和共产主义”，“我国人民知道什么叫修正主义，因为亲身尝试过了”，“现在比任何时候都更加需要反对修正主义”。科列加同志在接见代表团时说：“和平不能乞求，要站着，挺着腰，要进行斗争”，“如果帝国主义胆敢发动战争，我们就消灭它”。列希主席在接见代表团时说：“为了反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义和一切想破坏共产主义事业的人，我们党和我国人民是不惜牺牲一切的”。“不论在任何困难情况下，都要高举马克思列宁主义旗帜前进”。“没有任何力量，任何理由，能使我们离开这条道路”。“我们在敌人包围中毫不动摇地屹立着，因为我们掌握了马克思列宁主义原则，马克思列宁主义能使我们战胜一切困难”。阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党和霍查同志教导下，深刻了解，反对帝国主义及其走狗现代修正主义的斗争是和争取和平，建设社会主义，保卫祖国的自由和独立以及巩固社会主义阵营的团结的斗争密切联系在一起的。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是在火热的斗争中锻炼出来的战斗的马克思列宁主义的和人民有密切联系的党。阿尔巴尼亚人民热爱劳动党，热爱以霍查同志为首的党的中央委员会。
    中阿人民兄弟般的情谊
    阿尔巴尼亚各级领导同志和广大人民在接待代表团时所表现出的对于中国人民的深厚情谊，使人终生难忘。我们每个同志也都以能和阿尔巴尼亚的兄弟共度战斗的二十天感到光荣和幸福。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民对我党中央和毛主席，对中国人民的成就的崇高评价，对我们党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的热烈支持，使我们感到极大的鼓舞。我们深深感到，共同的理想，共同的目标，共同的事业，已经把中、阿两国人民在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中紧紧地联系在一起，这种友谊是任何敌人破坏不了的。当我们访问阿尔巴尼亚东北边境和南斯拉夫接壤的佩什科比区时，当地人民夹道欢迎代表团，区委请我们和列希主席一起参加了以我国各族人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的名字命名的农业生产合作社的命名典礼。社主席按照阿尔巴尼亚的民族传统，在由社员组成的乐队伴奏下，用面包和盐欢迎代表团。社长代表全体社员表示“以伟大的马克思列宁主义者、马克思列宁主义的天才毛泽东的名字命名，感到无限幸福”。列希主席热情地赞扬了新中国的成就，并嘱合作社争取更大的成就，不辜负这个伟大的名字。在阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那区访问新中国社时，社里开群众大会欢迎代表团，为我们表演了民族歌舞。在多莫里山附近的培拉特区，代表团访问了阿中友好社，社员们穿着节日的民族服装，吹打着乐器欢迎代表团，并为代表团表演了丰富多采的文娱节目。代表团从波格拉迪茨区去爱尔巴桑区途中经过里不拉日区，日程没有安排到该区参观，但该区区委第二书记和区人委负责同志坐吉普车追赶代表团，盛情地邀请我们到他们区里作客。代表团应邀访问后，离别时，区委和区人委领导同志一直陪同到该区的边界，才依依不舍地告别。在从霍查同志的故乡——纪诺卡斯特赴培拉特的途中，曾有一个叫霍列瓦的农业社，听说代表团要从他们社附近的公路上过，虽然已是晚上九点多钟，夜幕已笼罩了山区的大地，但社长和十来个社员带着各种酒和新鲜葡萄、核桃仁等食物等在路旁，为的是代表全体社员向中国人民、中国共产党和人民公社社员们表达自己的良好祝愿。所有这些，只是我们参观过程中所遇到的无数动人友好事例中的一小部分。就是这一小部分事实，也足以说明阿尔巴尼亚人民是如何的热爱新中国，热爱中国共产党和中国人民。正如培拉特区人民委员会主席说的那样：“我们是亲密的朋友、同志和兄弟，我们有血肉不可分割的关系，马克思列宁主义把我们紧紧地团结在一起，团结得像一个人一样。我们的友谊像多莫里山（是阿尔巴尼亚最雄伟、壮丽的山，它象征着阿尔巴尼亚人民反抗外族侵略的坚强斗争）一样牢固，是任何力量也动摇不了的。”
    今天，在阿尔巴尼亚建国十六周年的光荣的日子里，使我们更加想起了在阿尔巴尼亚访问时的深厚的兄弟友谊。我们祝贺阿尔巴尼亚人民在反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义斗争中所取得的伟大成就，祝阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设更进一步地发展，祝中阿两国人民友谊万古长青。
