Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 22nd: The Party Committee of Wandezhuang Urban People's Commune in Tianjin has universally implemented a "dual-role" leadership method, further improving leadership work.

In April of this year, the Party Committee of Wandezhuang People's Commune experimented with a "one-two-three system" leadership method—one day for study, two days for handling daily work, and three days for going deep into the grassroots—to improve leadership style and adapt to the needs of the rapid development of commune-run industry and collective welfare undertakings. In July, the Commune Party Committee decided that Party Committee secretaries, commune directors, and leaders at the department level and above, in addition to their original duties, would be assigned by the Commune Party Committee to serve as deputy positions in branch communes and commune-run factories, canteens, nurseries, and service stations, to further strengthen leadership over grassroots units. For example, the Medical Equipment Factory and the Hardware Factory were units with large output value, many workers, and relatively weak leadership in the entire commune. Wang Yipeng, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, and Liu Wu, the Secretary in charge of industry, respectively took on the posts of Deputy Factory Director in these two factories.

After Wandezhuang People's Commune implemented the "dual-role" leadership method, leading cadres not only brought various principles and policies directly to the grassroots and implemented them concretely with grassroots cadres, but also could discover and solve problems that arose during implementation at any time. After Wang Yipeng, First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, and Secretary Liu Wu took on deputy positions in the factories, they discovered that when the commune issued production tasks, it only emphasized output value and not the variety and quality requirements. As a result, some factories produced more products with high output value, high profits, and simple processes, thus omitting a batch of small commodities urgently needed by the market.

The Commune Party Committee repeatedly announced to all production units the production policy of commune-run industry serving the people's livelihood, and organized production personnel to hold forums with commercial cadres to understand market needs. They re-arranged the production of small commodities in a meticulous manner, resulting in an increase of more than double in the production of small commodities in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Leading cadres also became more concerned about the central tasks of the entire commune and the key issues in the grassroots units. In September, when the District Committee assigned various communes to collect scrap steel, the cadres serving as deputy positions in the grassroots units personally helped the grassroots units to study and deploy the central task together, enabling the task to be completed one month ahead of schedule. They also helped some grassroots units summarize thirteen experiences such as mobilizing the masses to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, and held seven on-site meetings and experience exchange meetings in the grassroots units.

At present, under the specific help of these leading cadres, grassroots units such as branch communes, factories, and livelihood services have universally established systems for collective leadership, financial approval, competition and evaluation, team accounting, and current affairs theory study, arranging all tasks in an orderly manner and cultivating a large number of leading backbones.

### 适应社办工业和集体福利事业发展的需要  天津万德庄公社推行双任制领导

    适应社办工业和集体福利事业发展的需要
    天津万德庄公社推行双任制领导
    新华社天津22日电　天津市万德庄城市人民公社党委普遍推行“双任制”的领导方法，进一步改进了领导工作。
    万德庄人民公社党委今年4月曾试行一天学习、两天处理日常工作、三天深入基层的“一二三制”领导方法，以改进领导作风，适应社办工业和集体福利事业迅速发展的需要。7月份，公社党委又决定党委书记、社长和部长以上的领导干部，除担负原有工作外，由公社党委统一安排到分社和社办的工厂、食堂、托儿所、服务站去担任副职，进一步加强对基层单位的领导。例如医疗器械厂和五金厂是全社产值大、工人多、领导又较弱的单位，公社党委第一书记王翊鹏和工业书记刘武就分别到这两个厂兼任副厂长。
    万德庄人民公社推行“双任制”领导方法后，领导干部不仅把各项方针、政策直接带到基层，与基层干部一起具体贯彻执行，而且可以随时发现和解决执行中出现的问题。公社党委第一书记王翊鹏、书记刘武到工厂担任副职后，发现公社下达生产任务时只讲产值，不讲品种和质量要求，有些工厂就多生产产值大、利润高、工序简易的产品，因而漏掉了一批市场急需的小商品。
    公社党委就向各生产单位反复宣布了社办工业为人民生活服务的生产方针，并且组织生产人员与商业干部举行座谈会，了解市场需要，重新细致地安排了小商品生产，结果第三季度全社小商品生产比第二季度增加了一倍以上。领导干部对全社的各项中心工作和各基层单位中的关键问题也更加关心了。今年9月区委布置各个公社收拣废钢铁，在基层单位担任副职的干部都亲自帮助基层单位一起研究部署中心工作，使这项任务提前一个月完成。他们还帮助一些基层单位总结了发动群众开展技术革新、技术革命运动等十三项经验，并在基层单位召开了七次现场会和经验交流会。
    目前，各分社、工厂、生活服务等基层单位，在这些领导干部的具体帮助下，已经普遍建立了集体领导、财务审批、竞赛评比、班组核算、时事理论学习等制度，把各项工作安排得井井有条，并培养出了大批领导骨干。
