    Cannot Focus on One Aspect
    Yu Dong
    The news about the Hei Jia Zhuang Production Team of the Liaohe Commune implementing the policy of distribution according to work and the work-point recording system powerfully illustrates that only by combining political leadership with material guarantees can we promote the development of production. Emphasizing one aspect and neglecting another, wanting only one aspect and not the other, will cause losses in production.
    To educate every working person to engage in production with a communist spirit of labor is the main aspect of labor education. However, in addition to ideological education, establishing a complete set of labor systems to examine each person's labor achievements, encourage members' enthusiasm for mutual competition, and care for the individual interests of farmers are also indispensable measures for developing production. Work-point recording is a very good system that is effective in rural areas of our country.
    The work-point recording system seems very simple, but in practice, and to truly do it well, it is not so easy. On the one hand, this is because it is related to the vital interests of each member; on the other hand, it is also necessary to continuously adjust the quotas for various farm tasks reasonably according to changes in production conditions during the implementation process. The experience of the Hei Jia Zhuang Production Team cadres personally participating in the trial implementation of labor quotas and correcting quotas is an important guarantee that this system can be better implemented and carried out.
    When the Hei Jia Zhuang Production Team initially implemented the work-point recording system, a few cadres once regarded the work-point recording as a "panacea" for promoting production. When encountering arduous production tasks or rush farming work, they did not conduct in-depth political and ideological work, but blindly increased work-point rewards, thereby fostering a focus on quantity over quality. This lesson proves from another perspective that material guarantees must have political leadership.

    不能只顾一面
    豫东
    潦河公社黑家庄生产队贯彻执行按劳分配政策和评工记分制度的新闻，有力地说明了必须把政治挂帅和物质保证结合起来，才能促进生产的发展。强调一面、忽视一面，只要一面、不要另一面，都会引起生产上的损失。
    教育每一个劳动人民以共产主义的劳动精神从事生产，这是劳动教育的主要方面。但是除了思想教育而外，规定出一整套劳动制度，用以检验每个人的劳动成就，鼓舞社员互相竞赛的热情，关怀农民的个人利益，这也是为了发展生产不可缺少的措施。评工记分就是一个在我国农村行之有效的很好的制度。
    评工记分制度看来很简单，实际执行起来，并且把它真正作好，却并不是那么容易。一方面因为这是关系每个社员的切身利益；另方面又需要在执行过程中，不断地根据生产条件的变化，对各种农活的定额进行合理的调整。黑家庄生产队干部亲自参加劳动定额的试行和改正定额，这是保证这个制度能以较好地实行和贯彻的重要经验。
    黑家庄生产队在开始实行评工记分的时候，有少数干部曾经把评工记分看成推动生产的“万能灵药”，遇到艰巨的生产任务或突击性农活时，不进行深入的政治思想工作，而是盲目地提高工分报酬，从而助长了只重数量不管质量。这个教训，从另一面证明了物质保证必须有政治挂帅。
