Supporting agriculture is the glorious task of the education front
Liu Yangqiao, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Since the Party Central Committee issued the great call to launch a campaign of increasing production and practicing economy centered on grain and steel, and for the whole party and the entire people to engage in agriculture and grain production, it has been warmly received by the entire people. Now, the mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production in Hubei Province has been launched vigorously and is developing more deeply and steadily. In this great mass movement, the education front should take supporting agricultural production as its most glorious political task. The great practice of socialist construction has given people on the education front an extremely profound education. People have gradually realized that the policy proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong of combining agriculture as the foundation, industry as the leading factor, and the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture is the fundamental policy for our country's socialist construction, thereby gradually recognizing the far-reaching significance of strengthening agriculture. Schools should not only treat supporting agriculture as a serious political issue but also as a fundamental issue in further implementing the Party's education policy.
    We are excited to see that since the educational revolution was launched in 1958, profound changes have been constantly taking place in schools of all levels and types. Now, the idea that education must serve proletarian politics, that education must be combined with productive labor, and that education must be led by the Party has been grasped by the masses and has formed a powerful material force. Since the educational revolution, schools of all levels and types have been increasingly aware of the need to support agriculture and have done a lot of work in directly engaging in agricultural production and vigorously developing science, technology, and culture; they have played a certain role in accelerating the development of agricultural production, promoting the technological transformation of agriculture, raising the cultural and technical level of the peasant masses, and gradually realizing the intellectualization of workers and peasants. Conversely, through supporting agriculture, not only have the political and ideological conditions of schools undergone drastic changes, but also the improvement of educational quality has been greatly affected. The constant and profound changes in schools are inseparable from the fact that the broad masses of teachers and students, with the continuous deepening of the education revolution, according to the needs of socialist construction and the principle of combining education with productive labor, have planned and continuously invested in the industrial and agricultural fronts, directly engaged in industrial and agricultural labor, and carried out various tasks of agricultural production services. The broad masses of teachers and students have, to varying degrees, realized from the socialist revolution in political ideology and the revolutionary practice of socialist construction that the issue of worldview is the most fundamental issue. Without solving the issue of worldview, the implementation of the communist education principle of combining education with productive labor and linking theory with practice is out of the question. Of course, the people cultivated in schools cannot truly become conscious and cultured laborers. Participating in agricultural production labor is one of the most effective measures to raise communist consciousness and establish a Marxist-Leninist worldview, and it is also an effective measure to overcome the serious "three separations" phenomenon in schools in the past and improve teaching quality, thereby comprehensively regarding supporting agriculture as one of the glorious responsibilities of the education front. Therefore, after the Party Central Committee issued the call for the whole party and the entire people to engage in agriculture and grain production, a new upsurge of the education front supporting agriculture has emerged, and new problems have been raised that require us to further solve them, otherwise, we will not be able to adapt to the current and long-term requirements of agricultural production, and further improvement of educational quality will also be affected. This new upsurge is manifested in all aspects. First of all, we see that the graduates of agricultural middle schools, with high revolutionary enthusiasm and lofty ideals, have embarked on the first line of agricultural production, where they want to show their talents in this vast world. Although the number is not large, they represent a new force that will be very promising; some graduates of full-time primary and secondary schools in rural areas have also responded to the Party's call to stay in the countryside, dedicate their youth to the glorious agricultural front, and take the construction of rural people's communes as their lofty ideal; some urban educated youth also want to join this glorious ranks. These energetic young people, who have embarked on the first line of agricultural production, will undoubtedly play an active role in strengthening the agricultural production front and raising the cultural and technical level of the commune members in rural areas. This is not only of great significance for solving the current labor shortage on the agricultural production front but also of great significance for gradually eliminating the three major differences and transitioning to communism in the future.
    Secondly, we can see that full-time primary and secondary schools in rural areas adapt to the agricultural production season, and teachers and students go to the first line of agricultural production together to participate in agricultural production labor. Full-time primary and secondary schools in cities have also begun to actively invest in the agricultural production movement in the suburbs during the busy farming season. In universities, teachers and students are organized more systematically to participate in agricultural production labor. In addition to directly participating in agricultural production labor on the first line, they have also further expanded their support for the agricultural front in all aspects, striving to make more contributions to the rapid development of agricultural production. For example, in accordance with the requirements of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, they have carried out scientific research in a comprehensive and focused manner, summarized the production experience of the masses, explored the laws of agricultural production, provided resource information and technical information for further development of agricultural production, and adopted various forms to train agricultural technical cadres and popularize scientific and technological knowledge, all of which have presented a new situation. This is of great significance for promoting agricultural production and promoting the continuous deepening of the education revolution. It is also wrong to underestimate this significance.
    Thirdly, we have also seen that in addition to directly supporting agriculture in all aspects, schools at all levels and types generally take the large-scale planting of vegetables and non-staple food production as an important aspect of regular participation in labor, in accordance with the principle of combining education with productive labor and the spirit of "one major, two auxiliary, and three combinations" in the comprehensive arrangement of productive labor, which is also very meaningful for reducing the supply of non-staple food to schools, improving school life, and developing the labor habits of teachers and students.
    Finally, we have also seen that some schools are building schools in rural areas in accordance with the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. This is a far-reaching strategic deployment, which needs to be recognized from the height of rapidly building socialism and transitioning to communism as a principle. Practice will prove its far-reaching significance.
    The above situation shows that the principle of combining education with productive labor has been further implemented, especially the combination of education and agricultural production labor has made new progress. This is a major event that is worth rejoicing. It should be said that it is a new victory achieved under the brilliant illumination of the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. In order to consolidate this victory and further expand this victory, it is still necessary to earnestly solve the new problems raised in this new upsurge, especially the following problems, which I think need to be solved in a concentrated manner:
    The first is to further strengthen the education based on agriculture. It is necessary to explain both theoretically and practically that "putting agriculture in the primary position and mobilizing the whole party and the entire people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production is not an expedient measure but a strategic policy for a considerably long period in our country's socialist construction." It "correctly reflects the objective laws and requirements of economic development." It makes people realize that implementing this policy is the political task of the whole party and the entire people. It makes them realize that "developing agriculture is a glorious cause, and agricultural labor is glorious labor. Agricultural labor is not only a major cause of building rural people's communes, but also an extremely important part of the entire socialist construction cause." Therefore, those of us who are engaged in education must treat this issue from the height of communist principles. In order to carry out the education revolution to the end, we must strengthen political and ideological work in all aspects, educate people to love labor, love the countryside, love the peasants, love agricultural labor, better implement the policy of education serving proletarian politics and education combined with productive labor, and further solve the contradiction between mental labor and physical labor ideologically, and strive to promote the laborization of intellectuals and the intellectualization of workers and peasants. Establish the materialist view that physical labor is the first need of all kinds of social life, and clarify that agricultural labor is the source of food and clothing at all times, and criticize the anti-Marxist-Leninist erroneous view that physical labor will disappear in communist society. Establish the materialist view that physical labor and agricultural labor cannot be eliminated. We must understand that without physical labor, there is not only no creation of material wealth, but also no culture. Physical labor will always be the first need of human society, and physical labor is the most glorious thing. The view of despising physical labor is the view of the exploiting class. In the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, this view is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology. This shows that before the completion of communism, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in terms of ideology is still a sharp struggle. If we let it go unchecked and do not carry out the socialist ideological revolution to the end, we cannot guarantee the smooth progress of socialist construction. In the mass movement of the whole party and the entire people to engage in agriculture and grain production, a small number of young people are unwilling to stay in the countryside and have thoughts of despising agriculture and agricultural labor, which need to be corrected. Labor education must carry out long-term and arduous work targeting the three major differences. In this way, strengthening ideological education based on agriculture has a more far-reaching significance. It will have a huge effect whether it is viewed from the perspective of eliminating the difference between mental labor and physical labor or from the perspective of eliminating the difference between urban and rural areas and the difference between workers and peasants.
    Secondly, according to the Party's policies and guidelines and the needs of today and tomorrow, we must further comprehensively solve a series of specific problems raised in the good situation in terms of development speed, school layout, school system, and other aspects. It should be seen that before the modernization of agriculture is realized, the phenomenon of labor shortage on the agricultural front cannot be ultimately solved; conversely, to realize the modernization of agriculture, science, technology, and culture are urgently needed. Without a considerable number of young people with culture and technology, the modernization of agriculture cannot be realized. The two are complementary and mutually reinforcing. Here, it is proposed that, on the one hand, we should try our best to tap the potential of labor and strengthen the first line of agricultural production, and on the other hand, we should consider how to take into account the characteristics of education and the long-term needs of socialist construction and make comprehensive arrangements. This is necessary from the perspective of strengthening agricultural production and promoting the laborization of intellectuals and the intellectualization of workers and peasants and gradually eliminating the three major differences. Therefore, students who voluntarily participate in agricultural production labor after graduation should be encouraged and supported; for primary and secondary school graduates in rural areas who cannot go on to higher education after graduation, they should be educated to stay in the countryside to engage in agricultural production, so that they realize that they can make a big difference in the vast world of the countryside and that knowledge and youth are needed to show their talents, and they should be told that the fundamental purpose of proletarian education is to promote the continuous development of social production and improve social labor productivity, and that going to school to further improve political and cultural levels is also to better participate in productive labor and build socialism, so it is a glorious thing to go to the first line of agricultural production if they cannot go to higher education. Young people in the Mao Zedong era should only fully combine their future with the urgent needs of socialist construction and go to the forefront of construction and to the first line of agricultural production, so that they will not tarnish the glorious title of young people in the Mao Zedong era. Graduates of agricultural middle schools should basically all stay in the countryside to participate in agricultural production, and agricultural middle schools should regard labor education as an important part of the fundamental content of communist education, so that students are not only educated in classroom teaching, but also deeply educated in terms of thoughts, feelings, skills, and habits in various labor activities, and truly train students to become a new generation of laborers who transform the world and build a new countryside. The above is one aspect. On the other hand, in order to meet the requirements of national construction, the existing full-time primary and secondary schools should in principle maintain full-time education, and concentrate efforts to run a number of key schools well. Therefore, the cultural and educational front should classify and rank schools according to the strength of the Party's leadership in each school and the different political ideology, culture, and professional level of teachers, and further study and promote the specific steps of teaching reform. All types of schools must resolutely and comprehensively implement the Party's education policy and the principle of combining work and rest, and strive to improve the quality of teaching.
    Thirdly, in addition to continuing to vigorously support agriculture in terms of labor force, science, technology, and culture, universities should also systematically transfer a group of cadres to help the work in rural areas in accordance with the instructions of the provincial Party committee, in order to further implement the Party's education policy, better solve the principle of linking theory with practice, and promote the education revolution in universities, and earnestly study the new problems in socialist construction. In schools, we must further strengthen Marxist-Leninist education and labor education, improve the communist consciousness of teachers and students, and make the broad masses of teachers and students realize that in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, if we do not transform our thinking, abandon outdated things, do not study new problems, and accept new things, we will be divorced from the masses and will be left behind by the times. We must clearly recognize that if we want to climb the peak of science, we must strengthen labor education without exception, and systematically arrange for them to participate in agricultural labor, so that they are not completely standing outside the all-party and all-people effort to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production.
    Fourthly, we must also see that after strengthening the first line of agricultural production, the Party's policies and guidelines are grasped by the masses, the awareness of cadres and the masses is further improved, and with the development of agricultural production, with the rational arrangement of production and life, and the further implementation of the issue of combining work and rest, the masses will further urgently demand to learn science, technology, and culture. In this way, the issue of how to further implement the policy of "walking on two legs" and run amateur education well will inevitably become prominent. Especially after a large number of educated youth are invested in the first line of agricultural production, on the one hand, they will strengthen the first line of agricultural production and bring culture to the countryside, and on the other hand, after participating in production, they will inevitably feel more and more that improving their cultural, scientific, and technological level is necessary for building rural people's communes, and they will demand to continue to improve their cultural, scientific, and technological level. The demands of the masses and their demands are reasonable, and we should reasonably solve the problems they raise. Now, when strengthening the agricultural front and saving labor to enrich the first line of production, we must comprehensively arrange amateur education. Therefore, we must resolutely and comprehensively implement the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" and strengthen the leadership of amateur education.
    Finally, it must also be pointed out that to solve these problems well, of course, depends on the comprehensive arrangement and unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, but the key problem lies in the strengthening of the school Party organizations. Without a strong core of Party leadership in the school, everything is out of the question. Therefore, when solving these problems in a concentrated manner, we must earnestly rectify the school's organization, strengthen the leadership of the school Party organizations, and strengthen the Party's construction work with the continuous deepening of the education revolution. Under the leadership of the Party, we must also strengthen the training of teachers and improve the political, cultural, and professional level of teachers to meet the new requirements under the excellent situation of socialist construction.

    支援农业是教育战线的光荣任务
    中共湖北省委书记处书记　刘仰峤
    在党中央发出开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动和全党动手，全民动手，大办农业，大办粮食的伟大号召以后，立即得到全民的热烈响应。现在湖北省大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动，已经轰轰烈烈地展开，正在更深入更踏实地向前发展。在这个伟大的群众运动中，教育战线应当把支援农业生产作为自己最光荣的政治任务。社会主义建设的伟大实践，使教育战线的人们受到了极其深刻的教育。人们逐渐认识到毛泽东同志提出的以农业为基础，以工业为主导，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业互相结合的方针，是我国进行社会主义建设的根本方针，从而逐渐认识了加强农业的深远意义。学校不仅要把支援农业作为一个严肃的政治问题来对待，而且要把它作为进一步贯彻党的教育方针的一个根本问题来对待。
    我们兴奋地看到，从1958年教育革命展开以来，各级各类学校都不断地发生着深刻的变化。现在，教育必须为无产阶级政治服务，教育必须结合生产劳动，教育必须由党来领导，这个思想已为群众所掌握，形成了强大的物质力量。各级各类学校从教育革命以来，对支援农业的自觉性在日益提高，在直接从事农业生产和大办科学技术文化等各方面都作了不少的工作；对加速发展农业生产，促进农业技术改造，提高农民群众文化技术水平，逐步实现工农群众知识化等方面都发挥了一定的作用。反过来，通过对农业的支援，不仅使学校的政治思想情况发生了激剧的变化，而且对教育质量的提高也发生了重大的作用。学校不断地发生着深刻的变化，是和广大师生随着教育革命不断深入，根据社会主义建设的需要和教育结合生产劳动的原则，有计划地不断地投入工农业战线直接从事工农业劳动和开展农业生产服务的各项工作分不开的，广大的师生从政治思想上的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的革命实践中已经不同程度地体会到世界观的问题是一个最根本的问题，世界观的问题不解决，教育结合生产劳动，理论联系实际的共产主义教育原则的贯彻是谈不上的，当然在学校中培养出来的人也就不能真正成为有觉悟有文化的劳动者。参加农业生产劳动对提高共产主义觉悟，树立马克思列宁主义世界观则是最有效的措施之一，也是克服过去学校中严重的“三脱离”现象和提高教学质量的有效措施，从而也就从各方面把支援农业作为教育战线的光荣职责之一。所以在党中央发出全党动手、全民动手、大办农业、大办粮食的号召以后，教育战线支援农业就出现了新的高潮，也提出了新的问题，要我们进一步加以解决，否则就不能适应农业生产当前的和长远的要求，也会使进一步提高教育质量受到影响。这种新的高潮表现在各个方面。首先看到的是，农业中学的毕业同学，以高度的革命热情，抱着远大的理想走上了农业生产第一线，他们要在这个广阔的天地大显身手，虽然数量不大，但他们代表的是一支新生的力量，是会大有作为的；还有农村中全日制中小学毕业的一部分毕业同学，他们也响应党的号召，留在农村，要把自己的青春献给光荣的农业战线，要把建设农村人民公社作为自己的崇高理想；还有一些城市的知识青年也要投身于这个光荣的行列。这些朝气蓬勃的青年，走上农业生产第一线，对于加强农业生产战线，对于提高农村公社社员的文化技术水平，无疑地会发挥其积极的作用。这不仅对解决当前农业生产战线上劳动力紧张的问题有重大的意义，而且对逐渐消灭三个差别，将来向共产主义过渡也有极重大的意义。
    其次可以看到的是，农村中的全日制中小学适应农业生产季节，师生一起奔向农业生产第一线，参加农业生产劳动。城市中的全日制中小学也开始在农忙的时候积极投入近郊区的农业生产运动。在高等学校中，也更有计划地组织师生参加农业生产劳动。除直接投入农业生产第一线参加生产劳动外，并且从各方面进一步展开了对农业战线的支援，力求对迅速发展农业生产做出更多的贡献。如根据大办农业、大办粮食的要求，全面而又有重点地开展科学研究，总结群众的生产经验，探索农业生产的规律；为进一步发展农业生产提供资源资料和技术资料；采取多种多样的形式，培养农业技术干部，普及科学技术知识等等方面都呈现出新的局面。这对促进农业生产，促进教育革命不断深入也都是有重大意义的。低估这个意义也是不对的。
    再其次，我们还看到各级各类学校除直接从各方面支援农业外，一般都根据教育结合生产劳动的原则和“一主二辅三结合”的精神，在全面安排生产劳动时，把大种蔬菜、副食品的生产作为经常参加劳动的一个重要方面，这对减少对学校的副食品供应、搞好学校生活、养成师生的劳动习惯也都是很有意义的。
    最后，我们还看到部分学校正根据党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针到农村建校。这是一个远大的战略部署，更是需要提到高速度地建设社会主义并向共产主义过渡的高度原则来认识的。实践将会证明它的深远意义。
    上述情况表明，教育与生产劳动相结合的原则进一步的得到贯彻，特别是教育与农业生产劳动的结合有了新的发展。这是值得我们欢欣鼓舞的大事。应该说是在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉照耀下取得的新胜利。为了巩固这个胜利，并进而扩大这个胜利，就还必须认真地解决在这个新高潮中提出的新问题，特别是以下几个问题，我认为有集中解决的必要：
    第一是进一步加强农业为基础的教育问题。要从理论上实践上说明“把农业放在首要地位，动员全党全民大办农业、大办粮食，不是什么权宜之计，而是我国社会主义建设过程中一个相当长的时期内的战略方针”。是“正确地反映了经济发展的客观规律和要求”。使人们认识到贯彻执行这个方针是全党全民的政治任务。认识到“发展农业是光荣的事业，农业劳动是光荣的劳动。农业劳动不但是建设农村人民公社的重大事业，而且是整个社会主义建设事业的极其重要的部分”。所以我们做教育工作的必须把这个问题提到共产主义的原则高度来对待。为把教育革命进行到底，必须从各方面加强政治思想工作，教育人们热爱劳动，热爱农村，热爱农民，热爱农业劳动，更好地贯彻教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育结合生产劳动的方针，进一步地从思想上解决脑力劳动和体力劳动的矛盾，努力促进知识分子劳动化，工农群众知识化。确立体力劳动是人类各种社会生活第一需要的唯物主义观点，明确农业劳动在什么时候都是衣食之源，批判那种认为到共产主义社会就会消灭体力劳动的反马克思列宁主义的错误观点。树立体力劳动和农业劳动是消灭不了的唯物主义观点。要懂得没有体力劳动，不仅谈不上物质财富的创造，而且也就不会有文化。体力劳动永远是人类社会的第一需要，体力劳动是最光荣的事情，轻视体力劳动的观点是剥削阶级的观点，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的时期，这种观点是资产阶级思想的表现。这就说明在共产主义建成以前，无产阶级和资产阶级意识形态方面谁战胜谁的斗争，仍然是尖锐的斗争，如果任其自流，不把社会主义的思想革命进行到底，就不能保证社会主义建设的顺利进行。在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的群众运动中，有少数青年不愿留在农村，轻视农业、轻视农业劳动的思想，需要加以纠正。劳动教育要针对三个差别，进行长期的艰巨的工作。这样加强以农业为基础的思想教育就有了更深远的意义。不论从消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别来看，也不论从消灭城乡差别和工农差别来看，都会发生巨大的作用。
    其次，要根据党的方针路线，今天和明天的需要，就发展速度、学校布局、学校制度等各方面，来进一步全面解决在大好形势下提出的一系列的具体问题。应当看到，在农业的现代化没有实现以前，农业战线上劳动力紧张的现象是不能够最终解决的；反过来要实现农业的现代化，又迫切地需要科学技术文化，没有相当数量的有文化有技术的青年，也是不能实现农业的现代化的。两者是相辅相成互相促进的。这里就提出一方面要尽量挖掘劳动潜力加强农业生产第一线的问题，另一方面也就提出了如何兼顾到教育事业的特点和社会主义建设的长远需要，全面安排的问题。这从加强农业生产上来看和促进知识分子劳动化、工农群众知识化，逐步消灭三个差别上看，都是必要的。所以，对于毕业后自愿参加农业生产劳动的学生，应该给予鼓励和支持；对于农村中毕业后不能升学的中小学毕业生，要教育他们留在农村中从事农业生产，使他们认识在农村的广阔天地里是大有作为，需要知识青年大显身手的，向他们说明无产阶级教育的根本目的就在于促进社会生产的不断发展，提高社会的劳动生产率，升学读书进一步提高政治、文化水平也是为了更好地参加生产劳动建设社会主义，所以不能升学而奔向农业生产第一线是光荣的事情。毛泽东时代的青年，只有把自己的前途和社会主义建设的迫切需要完全结合起来，到建设的最前线去，到农业生产第一线去，这样才不至于辱没毛泽东时代的青年的光荣称号。农业中学的毕业生基本上要全部留在农村参加农业生产，农业中学更要把劳动教育作为共产主义教育的根本内容的一个重要部分，使学生不仅在课堂讲授中受到教育，而且使学生在各种劳动中从思想感情技能习惯方面都受到深刻的教育，真正把学生培养成为改造世界建设新农村的一代新的劳动者。以上所述是一个方面。另一方面，为适应国家建设的要求，现有的全日制中小学原则上还是要保持全日制，而且要集中力量办好一批重点学校。所以文教战线要根据各个学校党的领导强弱和教师的政治思想、文化、业务水平的不同情况，分类排队，进一步研究推行教学改革的具体步骤。各类学校都必须坚决、全面执行党的教育方针和劳逸结合的原则，努力提高教学质量。
    第三，高等学校除继续在劳动力、科学技术文化等方面大力支援农业外，为了进一步地贯彻党的教育方针，更好地解决理论联系实际的方针，促进高等学校的教育革命，还应当有计划地抽调一批干部，根据省委指示去帮助农村的工作，认真地研究社会主义建设中的新问题。在学校中也要进一步加强马克思列宁主义教育和劳动教育，提高师生的共产主义觉悟，使广大师生认识到在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，如果不改造思想，抛弃过时的东西，不研究新的问题，接受新的事物，就会脱离群众，就会被时代甩在后面。必须明确认识，我们要攀登科学高峰，必须无例外的加强劳动教育，有计划地要他们参加农业劳动，不让他们完全站在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的外边。
    第四，还要看到加强农业生产第一线以后，党的政策方针为群众所掌握，干部、群众的觉悟进一步提高，随着农业生产的发展，随着生产生活合理的安排，劳逸结合的问题得到进一步贯彻解决，群众就会进一步地迫切要求学习科学技术文化。这样，如何进一步贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，办好业余教育的问题就必然要突出起来。特别是在大量知识青年投入农业生产第一线以后，一方面他们将会在加强农业生产第一线的同时，将文化输送到农村，另一方面，他们在参加生产后，也必然更感到提高文化科学技术水平对建设农村人民公社的必要性而提出继续提高文化科学技术水平的要求。群众和他们的要求，都是合理的，我们应该合理解决他们提出的问题。现在当加强农业战线、节省劳动力充实生产第一线的时候，更要全面安排业余教育。所以必须坚决地全面地贯彻党的“两条腿走路”的方针，加强业余教育的领导。
    最后，还必须提出的是，要很好地解决这些问题，当然有赖于各级党委的全面安排，统一领导，但关键问题还在于学校党组织的加强，学校没有坚强的党的领导核心，一切都是谈不上的。所以在集中解决这些问题的时候，就要认真地整顿学校的组织，加强学校党组织的领导，随着教育革命的不断深入加强党的建设工作。在党的领导下，还要加强教师的培养，提高教师的政治文化业务水平，以适应社会主义建设大好形势下的新要求。
