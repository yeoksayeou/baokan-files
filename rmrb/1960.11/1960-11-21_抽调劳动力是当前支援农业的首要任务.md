The staff and workers on the capital construction front in Harbin have been vigorously promoting "four modernizations" upgrades in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. They have created more than 4,800 sets of indigenous and foreign-made machinery, over 1,000 automated single machines, and more than 5,470 various advanced tools. After five rounds of sorting, appraisal, finalization, and matching, the city's capital construction front now has more than 370 automated production lines and linked lines, greatly improving construction efficiency. To date, more than 26,800 laborers have been saved, enriching the front line of agricultural production and other production and construction posts.

  Hualing Coal Mine Innovates Technology
  Production Increases, Manpower Decreases

  (Reported by this newspaper) In late October, the Hualing Coal Mine in Guangdong Province transferred 250 laborers to support agricultural production. However, the average daily output in early November increased by 36.6% compared to October, and the average work efficiency increased by 31.45% compared to October, achieving manpower reduction and increased production, and sustained leap forward.

  In order to achieve manpower reduction and increased production, the Hualing Coal Mine Party Committee mobilized the masses to vigorously consolidate, improve, and promote "four modernizations" projects; implemented fixed staffing and quotas, and further improved labor organization. During this period, the mine implemented 31 innovation projects, mechanizing or semi-mechanizing many manual operations, greatly increasing labor productivity. For example, No. 16 small coal kiln installed an electric winch, increasing labor productivity five times compared to manual carrying; the use of iron rails instead of wooden rails for roadway transportation in small coal kilns saved more than 20 laborers.

  Nanjing Construction Departments Widely Apply Innovation Achievements
  Transfer Nearly 10,000 Laborers to Strengthen the Agricultural Front

  (Reported by this newspaper) Since the beginning of this year, the capital construction departments in Nanjing City have transferred more than 9,800 people to the front line of agricultural production. During this period, the city's completed capital construction investment increased by 25.9% compared to the same period last year, with the construction and installation workload increasing by 29.3% compared to the same period last year. Labor productivity (overall) increased by 66% compared to the same period last year. The completed engineering projects and the area completed also showed significant growth compared to the same period last year.

  In order to achieve the requirements of increasing production without increasing manpower, and increasing production while reducing manpower, the staff and workers of the Nanjing City capital construction departments launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations" in the first half of this year. In this movement, the vast number of staff and workers created and successfully trial-produced thousands of advanced construction machines and tools. In 13 major types of work, more than 380 construction "dragons" were matched, and more than 60 automated and semi-automated production linked lines and more than 360 production assembly lines were built. More than 400 single machines in 10 production groups were automated, and all external scaffolding was eliminated, greatly improving the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization. For example, all bricklayers launched a movement to "lay 10,000 bricks per person per day," creating many advanced bricklaying machines such as electric mortar spreaders and electric mortar spreading bricklaying machines, increasing bricklaying efficiency by more than double, and up to more than ten times. More than 100 bricklayers broke the target of laying 10,000 bricks per day. In a short period of time, the vast number of earthwork workers created 29 types of earthwork construction machinery and matched them into "dragons," increasing the average daily construction efficiency per person from 2 cubic meters to over 35 cubic meters. These two types of work alone saved more than 1,800 laborers to support agricultural production.

  In order to achieve the requirement of increasing production while reducing manpower, they generally changed the three-level management system to a two-level management system of company and construction site, with the construction site as the basic construction unit, and established professional work teams mainly composed of bricklayers, carpenters, concrete workers, and plasterers. According to the construction needs of new machines, new processes, and new production assembly lines, the professional teams implemented group organization according to "dragons," fixing machines, people, and efficiency. This not only reduced the levels and strengthened the leadership at the grassroots level, but also greatly streamlined auxiliary workers and non-production personnel.

  Yifeng Vigorously Develops Ox-Drawn Carts
  Manpower Reduced, Transportation Efficiency Increased

  Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 20th - Yifeng County, Jiangxi Province, has vigorously developed ox-drawn cart transportation according to the characteristics of the mountainous area, which has improved transportation efficiency. The county has saved more than 15,000 laborers from short-distance transportation to strengthen the agricultural front line, and completed the annual short-distance transportation plan three months ahead of schedule.

  Yifeng County originally did not have ox-drawn carts, and historically relied on human carrying for transportation. Now, all communes and brigades in the county have ox-drawn cart transportation teams, and most factories and enterprises also widely use ox-drawn carts.

  Due to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the laborers originally engaged in short-distance transportation in Yifeng County accounted for almost one-third of the total rural labor force, and many materials were backlogged for a long time awaiting transportation. The Yifeng County Party Committee believes that the backwardness of short-distance transportation tools is an important reason for the tight rural labor force. Without quickly solving this problem, neither transportation tasks can be well completed nor more labor can be concentrated on agricultural production. Therefore, since last year, the County Party Committee has been determined to vigorously develop ox-drawn cart transportation to improve transportation capacity.

  Ox-drawn or horse-drawn carts have long been the main tools for daily transportation in the northern and central regions of China, but they are still a new thing in some mountainous areas in the south. Yifeng County has done a lot of detailed organizational work in promoting ox-drawn carts. Fei Qingzhang, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, personally used the first ox-drawn cart in Tangpu Commune as a pilot project, with good results. Then, the Party Committees of the communes also conducted use trials and organized visits and comparisons for full promotion. After continuous reform, the carrying capacity of an ox-drawn cart in Yifeng County is now equal to the carrying capacity of 15 laborers. The daily distance has increased from more than 30 li to 50 or 60 li.

  Suining Industrial Departments Expand Innovation Achievements
  More than 400 Laborers Head to the Agricultural Front Line

  (Reported by this newspaper) In the production increase and conservation movement, factories and enterprises in the urban area of Suining County, Sichuan Province, actively consolidated, promoted, and improved innovation achievements. In September and October, 480 laborers were saved and put into the agricultural front line. In October, more than 1,500 people were also sent to participate in the battle to support "four autumns", but the total industrial output value from the 1st to the 25th still increased by 16.84% compared to the same period in September. Nineteen factories in the district have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule, and the production, quality, variety and other indicators of 22 factories have achieved a comprehensive and sustained leap forward, winning the "manpower reduction and increased production" award from the County and District Party Committees.

  In order to improve labor productivity and save manpower to support the agricultural front line, the County and District Party Committees decided to further carry out the technical innovation movement. For innovation projects that need to be consolidated, promoted, and improved, they were organized separately according to the degree of importance and urgency, with special forces, and the method of on-site "consultation" was adopted to solve them within a time limit. For example, the printing and dyeing workshop of the knitting industry originally used a wooden frame disc hand-cranked yarn dyeing machine, which was laborious, inefficient, and dyed yarn in monotonous colors, so workers were unwilling to use it. In mid-October, the Party branch organized veteran workers and technicians to review and sort it out, and made accessories by themselves, and it only took three days to transform it into a foot-operated automatic yarn dyeing machine. Compared with the original wooden frame disc hand-cranked yarn dyeing machine, it saved one person, and the work efficiency was increased by more than 50%. The dyed yarns of various colors were bright and uniform, and the variety of patterns also increased.

  In the in-depth development of the technical innovation movement, many leading cadres personally went to workshops and groups to focus on key points. The County Party Committee's industrial secretary learned that the cotton textile industry lacked carpenters and iron parts in the manufacture of rapid loom frames, so he organized workers from the farm tool factory, hardware factory, and machinery factory to support them. After a half-month of concentrated effort, 12 rapid looms were installed. Eight of them are now officially in production, and the daily output of each machine has increased by 20%-30%. With the strong support of the leadership, in the past two months, the factories have promoted and improved 867 new tools, greatly improving labor productivity.

  Haiyuan Adjusts and Merges Commune-Run Factories
  Frees Up a Large Number of People to Strengthen Agriculture

  (Reported by this newspaper) The thirteen people's communes in Haiyuan County, Ningxia Autonomous Region, originally had 27 factories. In the production increase and conservation movement, the Haiyuan County Party Committee and the Party Committees of the Haiyuan County communes merged the 27 commune-run factories into 13 joint factories according to different natures, giving full play to the potential of manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and realizing one factory for multiple purposes, one machine for multiple purposes, one object for multiple purposes, and one person for multiple skills. In this way, the commune-run industries of the thirteen communes freed up 180 laborers, accounting for 35.16% of the original number, to directly participate in agricultural production. The number of people has decreased, but the production efficiency has been greatly improved. The commune-run industry in the county has completed the annual production plan three months ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 26%, achieving increased production with reduced manpower.

  Wan Yuqin, a seventh-grade technician and Communist Party member of the Wuxi Machine Tool Factory, actively supports the construction of the Anzheng Commune Farm Machinery Factory. After arriving at the metalworking workshop, he enthusiastically trains apprentices. In more than four months, each apprentice can operate independently, and most apprentices have reached the second-grade technician level.

    抽调劳动力是当前支援农业的首要任务
    哈尔滨基建职工大搞“四化”升级  节约二万多劳动力支援工农业生产
    本报讯　哈尔滨市基本建设战线广大职工，在以“四化”为中心的技术革新、技术革命运动中，大搞“四化”升级，配套成龙，现在已经创制出土洋机械四千八百多台，自动化单机一千多台，各种先进工具五千四百七十多件。经过五次整理、鉴定、定型和配套，全市基本建设战线，已拥有三百七十多条自动化生产线和联动线，大大提高了施工效率，到目前为止，已节约出二万六千八百多个劳动力，充实了农业生产第一线和其它生产建设岗位。华岭煤矿革新技术
  生产增加人力减少
    本报讯　广东省华岭煤矿10月下旬抽调了二百五十个劳动力支援农业生产，但11月上旬的平均日产量却比10月份增加36.6％，平均工效比10月份增加31.45％，实现了减人增产，持续跃进。
    为了做到减人增产，华岭煤矿党委发动群众大搞“四化”项目的巩固、提高、推广；实行定员、定额，进一步改善了劳动组织。在这期间，全矿共实现了三十一项革新项目，使很多人工操作实现了机械化、半机械化，大大提高了劳动生产率。例如，第十六号小煤窑安装了电动绞车，劳动生产率比人力肩挑提高五倍；小煤窑的巷道运输，用铁轨代替木轨，节省劳动力二十多人。
    南京基建部门广泛运用革新成果  抽调近万个劳动力加强农业战线
    本报讯　今年以来，南京市基本建设部门已抽调九千八百多人到农业生产第一线。在这期间，全市完成的基本建设投资额比去年同期增长了25.9％，其中建筑安装工作量比去年同期增长了29.3％，劳动生产率（全员）比去年同期提高66％，建成的工程项目和竣工的面积比去年同期也都有显著增长。
    南京市基本建设部门职工为了实现增产不增人，增产又减人的要求，今年上半年，开展了一个以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动。在这个运动中，广大职工创造和试制成功了成千上万件先进施工机具。在十三个主要工种中，配套成三百八十多条施工龙，建成了六十多条自动化和半自动化的生产联动线以及三百六十多条生产流水线。有十个生产小组四百多台单机实现了自动化，全部取消了外脚手架，使机械化半机械化水平有了很大的提高。如全体瓦工开展了“每人每日砌万块砖”的运动，创造出了电动铺灰器、电动铺灰砌砖机等许多先进砌砖机具，使砌砖效率提高一倍多，最高提高到十多倍。有一百多名瓦工突破了日砌万块砖的指标。广大土方工人在短短时间内创造了二十九种土方施工机械，并搭配成龙，平均每人每日的施工效率由两立方米提高到三十五立方米以上。仅这两个工种，就节约出一千八百多劳力支援了农业生产。
    为了实现增产又减人的要求，他们普遍将三级管理制改为公司、工地两级管理制，以工地为基层施工单位，成立以瓦工、木工、混凝土工、抹灰工等为主体的专业工作队。专业队根据新机具、新工艺和新生产流水线的施工需要，实行按龙编组，定机、定人、定效率。这样不仅减少了层次，加强了基层的领导，而且大大精简了附属工和非生产人员。
    宜丰大办牛拉板车  人力减少运效提高
    新华社南昌20日电　江西宜丰县根据山区特点大办牛拉板车运输，提高了运输效率。全县已从短途运输中节约出一万五千多个劳动力加强了农业第一线，并提前三个月完成了全年的短途运输计划。
    宜丰县原来没有牛拉板车，历史上一向靠人挑人背运输。现在，全县各公社、大队都有了牛拉板车运输队，大部分工厂、企业也广泛地使用了牛拉板车。
    由于工农业生产大跃进，宜丰县原来从事短途运输的劳动力几乎占了农村总劳动力的三分之一，还有不少物资长期积压待运。中共宜丰县委认为，短途运输工具落后，是农村劳力紧张的一个重要原因，不迅速解决这个问题，既不能很好完成运输任务，又不能集中更多劳动力用于农业生产。因此，从去年以来，县委决心大办牛拉板车运输，提高运输能力。
    牛拉或马拉板车，在我国北部和中部地区早已是民间日常运输的主要工具，但在南方的一些山区还是一项新东西。宜丰县在推广牛拉板车过程中，曾做了许多细致的组织工作。县委第一书记费庆章亲自在堂浦公社使用了第一辆牛拉板车做试点，效果很好。接着，各公社党委也进行了使用试验，又组织了参观、评比，全面推广。经过不断改革，现在宜丰县的一辆牛拉板车的载重量等于十五个劳动力的运量。日行由三十多华里增加到了五、六十华里。
    遂宁工业部门扩大革新成果四百多劳力奔赴农业第一线
    本报讯　四川省遂宁县城区工厂企业在增产节约运动中，积极巩固、推广和提高革新成果，9、10两月节约出四百八十个劳动力投入农业第一线。10月份还派出一千五百多人参加支援“四秋”战斗，但1至25日的工业总产值仍比9月同期上升了16.84％。全区有十九个厂已经提前超额完成了全年生产计划，二十二个厂的产量、质量、品种等各项指标实现了全面持续跃进，荣获县、区党委“减人增产”的奖状。
    为了提高劳动生产率，节约人力支援农业第一线，县、区党委决定进一步开展技术革新运动。对需要巩固、推广和提高的革新项目，分别轻重缓急，组织专门力量，采取现场“会诊”的办法，限期解决。如针织行业印染车间，原来使用的木架圆盘手摇染纱机，用起来费力大，工效低，染的纱颜色单调，工人都不愿意使用。10月中旬，党支部组织老工人、技术员进行复查、整理，自己动手制造配件，只花了三天时间就改制成了一台脚踏自动染纱机，与原来木架圆盘手摇染纱机比较，节约了一个人，工效还提高50％以上，染出的各色纱支颜色鲜艳均匀，花色品种也增多了。
    在深入开展技术革新运动中，许多领导干部都亲自到车间、小组、大抓关键。县委工业书记了解到棉纺业在制造快速织布机机架中，缺乏木工和铁件，便组织农具厂、五金厂、机械厂的职工支援。经半月突击，就安装好了快速织布机十二台。目前已正式投入生产的八台，每台日产量提高20％—30％。在领导的大力支持下，两个月来，各厂共推广和改良新工具八百六十七件，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    海原调整合并社办工厂  腾出大批人手加强农业
    本报讯　宁夏自治区海原县十三个人民公社，原有二十七个工厂。在增产节约运动中，中共海原县委和海原县各公社党委，将二十七个社办工厂，按不同性质合并为十三个联合工厂，充分发挥了人力、财力、物力的潜力，实现了一厂多用、一机多用、一物多用、一人多能。这样，十三个公社的社办工业共腾出占原有人数35.16％的一百八十个劳动力直接参加了农业生产。人员减少了，生产效率却大大提高了，全县社办工业已提前三个月超额26％完成了全年生产计划，实现了增产又减人。（附图片）
    辽宁省本溪市许多工厂积极挖掘生产潜力，为明年农业增产提供机具。这是本溪市电机制造厂党总支书记邢杰（中）深入车间，和职工一起用普通铸铁片代替矽钢片，制造农村用的“土电动机”。　新华社记者　贾承滨摄
