    An Important Policy
    Zhang Ke
    Correctly handling the dialectical relationship between production relations and productive forces is an extremely important Marxist-Leninist principle for promoting production development.
    The establishment of people's communes and the emergence of commune ownership in our country are a great contribution to improving rural production relations and promoting the great development of agricultural productive forces. However, the realization of complete commune ownership must have a development process. This requires the commune to have a stronger economic strength, and requires the economic development level of each production team to be roughly balanced. It takes a lot of time to complete this process, and it won't work if you are in a hurry.
    Adhering to the Party's policy and implementing the small-scale ownership of the production team in the people's commune is an important policy for running the people's commune well at present. This policy correctly reflects the current situation of production relations and productive forces in our rural areas. Once the masses understand and master the Party's policy, their enthusiasm will be unleashed uncontrollably, creating one victory after another.
    The change in the Zhixi Production Team of the Chuanliao Commune in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province is a good illustration. Because this team adhered to the correct policy of small-scale ownership of the production team, all aspects of production have been rapidly developed. Last year, they had to supply more than 20,000 catties of grain to the state, but this year they have become a team with a surplus of 30,000 catties of grain. All four production teams in the team exceeded production, and after overfulfilling the contracted production tasks, they also operated more than 30 sideline productions. By the end of October, the average income per household was more than 30 yuan.
    The central link in implementing the small-scale ownership of the production team is to implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system on the basis of adhering to the "four fixings." The reason why the Zhixi Production Team's production is so good is because they insist on implementing the system of guaranteed output, guaranteed work, guaranteed cost and overproduction reward for each production team. Under the condition that each team guarantees the completion of the contracted production task, they do not interfere with the team's planting plan, farm work arrangement and technical measures casually, and do not add arbitrary commands; they also leave room when formulating the contracted production target, so that the contracted production team has output to exceed and rewards to be obtained, and guarantee the reward is fulfilled. Because the "three guarantees and one reward" is based on the "four fixings," the production team does not casually transfer the labor force, land, draught animals, and farm tools of the production team, so that the team can take the initiative to arrange the labor force, use the land reasonably, and strive to exceed production; it enables the team to plan to raise, use and breed draught animals, carefully keep, repair and use farm tools; save the use of investment, reduce financial expenditure; and explore the potential of land and labor in many ways, develop various productions beyond the contracted production tasks, and increase income.
    Will the small team's partial ownership affect the production team's basic ownership, and will it make the commune members "stand on two boats, and people are not determined," as some people say? Facts have proved that the small team's partial ownership does not hinder the production team's basic ownership in the slightest. On the contrary, if the small team does not have this little flexible right, and everything, big or small, is uniformly managed by the production team, it will be unfavorable to the development of production. Under the premise of ensuring the completion of the production team's contracted production task, the small team has a small part of ownership, which can give play to the labor potential of the commune members, make full use of the resources and conditions of each team, develop production, and increase income.
    The combination of large collective and small freedom makes people determined. The small team's partial ownership is an organic component of the three-level ownership system of the people's commune, and is an important issue for mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the small team and the commune members. All localities should resolutely implement and earnestly implement it like the Zhixi Production Team.

    一个重要的政策
    张克
    正确处理生产关系和生产力的辩证联系，是一条促进生产发展的极其重要的马克思列宁主义的原则。
    我国人民公社的成立和公社所有制的出现，是改进农村生产关系、促进农业生产力大发展的一个伟大的贡献。但是，实现完全的公社所有制，必须有一个发展的过程。这就需要公社有更强大的经济力量，需要各生产队的经济发展水平大体趋于平衡。完成这个过程需要很多时间，急了是不行的。
    坚持党的方针，贯彻人民公社的小队的小部分所有制，是当前办好人民公社的一项重要的政策。这个政策正确地反映了我国农村生产关系和生产力的现状。当群众一旦了解并掌握了党的政策，他们的积极性就会不可抑制地发挥出来，创造出一个又一个的胜利。
  浙江青田县船寮公社芝溪生产队的变化就是一个很好的说明。这个队由于坚持了生产小队小部分所有制这条正确的政策，各项生产都获得迅速的发展。去年他们还要国家供应两万多斤粮食，今年就变成了有三万斤余粮的队。全队四个生产小队，队队超产，并在超额完成包产任务以后，又经营了三十多项副业生产，到10月底止，平均每户已有三十多元的收入。
    贯彻小队小部分所有制的中心环节是在坚持“四固定”基础上，实行“三包一奖”制度。芝溪生产队的生产所以搞得好，就是因为他们对各个生产小队坚持实行包产、包工、包成本和超产奖励的制度，在各小队保证完成包产任务的条件下，对小队的种植计划、农活安排和技术措施不随便干涉，不乱加指挥；他们在制定包产指标时也留有余地，让包产小队有产可超，有奖可得，并保证奖励兑现。因为“三包一奖”是建立在“四固定”的基础上，生产队对生产小队的劳力、土地、耕畜、农具不随便调动，就使小队有可能主动安排劳力、合理使用土地，努力争取超产；就使小队可以有计划地饲养、使用和繁殖耕畜，精心地保管、修补和使用农具；节约使用投资，减少财政开支；并多方挖掘土地和劳动潜力，发展包产任务以外的各项生产，增加收入。
    小队有了小部分所有权会不会影响生产队的基本所有权，会不会像有些人说的会使社员“脚踏两只船，人定心不定”呢？事实证明，小队小部分所有权丝毫不妨碍生产队的基本所有权。相反，如果小队没有这点灵活权利，事无大小，一切都由生产队统一管理，对发展生产反而会不利的。在保证完成生产队包产任务的前提下，小队有了小部分所有权，就可以发挥社员劳动潜力，充分利用各小队的资源和条件，发展生产，增加收入。
    大集体和小自由互相结合，人定心也定。小队小部分所有权是人民公社三级所有制的有机组成部分，是调动小队和社员生产积极性的重要问题，各地都应该像芝溪生产队这样，坚决执行，认真贯彻。
