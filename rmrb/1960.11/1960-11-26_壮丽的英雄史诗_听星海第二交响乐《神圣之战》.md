Magnificent Heroic Epic
    ——Listening to Xian Xinghai's Second Symphony "Sacred War"
    Zhao Feng
    Xian Xinghai's "Second Symphony – Sacred War" was performed for the first time during the solemn national commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the passing of this people's musician. This is a major event in China's musical life. This work, which was the subject of some debate in the past, has been correctly interpreted through the efforts of the Central Conservatory of Music's student orchestra, under the direction of Comrade Huang Feili. This allows us to recognize the symphony for what it is: a work that highly summarizes the victorious development of the Soviet people's Great Patriotic War, profoundly embodies the Soviet people's indomitable fighting spirit and heroic spirit, and concretely expresses the glorious revolutionary idea that a just revolutionary war is bound to ultimately defeat an unjust counter-revolutionary war. In this work, Xinghai embodies the spirit of a revolutionary, that is, the spirit of revolutionary optimism that always overflows even in the most difficult years of the revolution.

    Xinghai wrote this symphony while studying in the Soviet Union, during the most intense and difficult years of the Soviet Patriotic War. At that time, the enemy was temporarily in a superior position on some battlefields, and life in the rear was very difficult. However, Xinghai, the revolutionary, was not daunted by these temporary difficulties. On the contrary, he held a firm belief in the inevitable victory of the revolutionary war, even when it was temporarily at a disadvantage. To understand this symphony, we must first start from this point.

    "Sacred War" is a single-movement symphony. The contradictory development of two musical images constitutes this epic work. The leading musical image is the powerful, rallying melody of "The Internationale" ("L'Internationale"), representing the image of the Soviet people. The other musical image represents German fascism, consisting of two characteristic rhythmic patterns and a series of chaotic sixteenth notes, which vividly remind us of the German fascists' "goose step" and tanks and airplanes. The music begins with a variation of "The Internationale" theme, symbolizing the peaceful labor and life of the Soviet people. Suddenly, the strong, jarring motif representing fascism appears, representing Germany's perfidious attack on the Soviet Union. The "Internationale" theme appears in the lower instruments, representing the Soviet people rising up to resist and the heavy disaster inflicted upon the Soviet people by the German invaders, while in this mournful music we can hear the tremendous power of the Soviet people. The reappearance of "The Internationale" theme shows the Soviet people who have been mobilized and launched a heroic resistance against the German invaders. The two musical themes unfold in a strong, complex, contradictory conflict... The music transitions into a slow movement, a completely new musical material – a majestic, profound passion and a melody filled with infinite longing – appears in the string instruments. This is the Soviet people's love for their motherland, the Soviet people's mourning for the heroic martyrs, and also the Soviet people's infinite confidence in the future!

    The "Internationale" theme becomes louder and louder. At the end of the music, this loud, firm, rallying, and inspiring melody of "International Soviet" turns into a hymn of victory and enthusiastic cheers, symbolizing that the Soviet people will eventually achieve final victory – that a just revolutionary war will ultimately triumph over an unjust counter-revolutionary war.

    Anyone who has heard a performance of this symphony will be moved by this heroic epic movement. This is primarily because the work is permeated from beginning to end with an emotion of infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause and a belief in inevitable victory. We should not forget that when Xinghai was writing this work, many people had lost confidence in the revolutionary cause, seeing the temporary setbacks in the early stages of the Soviet Patriotic War and pessimistically believing that history would regress for several years. However, Xinghai, the revolutionary, drew the opposite conclusion from this to those insignificant people who history has proven wrong. When we hear this symphony played today, the optimistic, generous image of Xinghai is again presented before us: on the snowy Russian land, a tireless person walks with his head held high through the wind and snow, and even when he is seriously ill, he is always as energetic as usual... When we listen to the slow movement of this symphony, we hear not only the voice of the entire Soviet people, but also the indignation of the working class around the world at the crimes of the enemy and their infinite longing for the future. Deep lyricism adds infinite infectious power to this epic work, pouring out a sacred passion that seems to overwhelm everything.

    After listening to the performance of this symphony, we can proudly say that this slow movement is an important chapter in the symphonic literature. The content of this theme played by the string instruments has been expressed vividly by the Central Conservatory of Music's student orchestra – in the depths of solemn mourning is a sincere love for the motherland and the socialist cause, and in the sad and indignant emotions is an infinite longing for the future. Revolutionaries are fearless people, and revolutionary art is forever insulated from the feelings of depression and disappointment! Even when Xinghai uses the technique of leitmotif, he starts from the expression of thoughts and feelings and the creation of musical images. We only need to cite a few examples to illustrate everything. The first variation of "The Internationale" theme depicts the peaceful labor and life of the Soviet people, which is a new pastoral melody. When this theme reappears after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the rapid syllables and the use of dotted notes make this theme express the irrepressible power in indignation. The immediately following variation is a fast phrase after a syncopation, vividly expressing the Soviet people's rising up to resist and their heroic struggle. Finally, the "Internationale" theme rises and falls like a tide, sounding like the horns of march and charge... Here, the realistic approach based on imagery and the principle of the title can justifiably be called a model! We believe that if there is anything lacking in this symphony, it is that before and after the appearance of the slow movement, the structure is slightly loose, and it cannot more highly concentrate and generalize the heroic image of the Soviet people becoming stronger and stronger in battle. And this is something we have an obligation to make some necessary and serious corrections to, and through continuous performances, re-create it based on the feedback from the masses – the interpretation and handling of the performance. This symphony will surely be an important treasure in the treasury of China's symphonic literature!

    壮丽的英雄史诗
    ——听星海第二交响乐《神圣之战》
    赵沨
    冼星海的《第二交响乐——神圣之战》，在全国人民隆重纪念这位人民音乐家逝世十五周年的时候首次演出了，这是我国音乐生活中的一个重大事件。这个过去有争论的作品，经过中央音乐学院学生管弦乐队的努力，在黄飞立同志指挥下，得到正确的解释，使我们能够认识到这部交响乐的本来面目——高度地概括了苏联人民伟大的卫国战争的胜利发展，深刻地体现了苏联人民坚强不屈的斗争精神和豪迈气概，具体地表现了正义的革命战争必定要最终战胜非正义的反革命战争这一光辉的革命思想的作品。星海在这个作品中，体现了一个革命者的气概，那就是在革命的最艰苦的年代，也总是洋溢着革命的乐观主义精神的那种气概。
    星海在苏联学习时期写作这部交响乐的时候，正是苏联卫国战争最激烈、最艰苦的年代。那时，在有些战场敌人暂时还处于优势，后方生活很是艰难。但是，革命者的星海，没有为这暂时的困难吓倒，相反，他对于暂时处于劣势的革命战争抱着坚定的必胜信念。我们要想理解这部交响乐，首先要从这一点开始。
    《神圣之战》是一首单乐章的交响乐，两个音乐形象的矛盾发展，构成了这部史诗的作品。作为主导音乐形象的是《国际歌》中“英特那雄那尔”这一个有力、号召的音调，代表苏联人民的形象。另一个音乐形象代表德国法西斯，是两个有特性的节奏音型和一串骚乱的六连音，这使我们很形象地联想到德国法西斯的“鹅步”和坦克、飞机。音乐开始于《国际歌》主题的变形，象征着苏联人民的和平劳动生活。突然间，代表法西斯的那个强烈刺耳的音型出现了，这是德国法西斯对苏联的背信弃义的进攻。《国际歌》主题在低音乐器出现，这表现了苏联人民奋起应战和德寇加之于苏联人民头上的沉重的灾难，而在这悲愤的音乐中我们可以听到蕴藏着苏联人民的巨大的力量。《国际歌》主题的再次出现，已经动员起来的苏联人民对德寇展开了英勇的抵抗。两个音乐主题展开了强烈、复杂的矛盾冲突……音乐转入一个慢板，一个全新的音乐材料——雄浑、深沉的热情和带着无限向往之情的曲调在弦乐器上出现。这是苏联人民对祖国的热爱，这是苏联人民对英勇的烈士们的哀悼，这也是苏联人民对未来的无限信心！
    《国际歌》主题越来越响亮了，音乐结尾的时候，这个“国际苏维埃”的响亮、刚毅、号召和鼓舞的音调变成了胜利的颂歌和热烈的欢呼，象征着苏联人民终必获得最后的胜利——正义的革命战争必将最后战胜非正义的反革命战争。
    任何一个听过这部交响乐演出的人都会为这部英雄的史诗的乐章所感动，这首先是因为这部作品自始至终贯串着对革命事业的无限忠诚的情感和必将胜利的信念。我们不应健忘，就在星海写作这部作品的时候，不少人对革命事业丧失了信心，看到苏联卫国战争初期的暂时失利而认为历史将要倒退若干年而悲观失望。但是，革命者的星海，却从这里得到和那些历史证明是微不足道的人们的相反的结论。当我们在今天听到这部交响乐演奏时，我们眼前又展现了星海的那种乐观、豪爽的形象：在白雪皑皑的俄罗斯的大地上，昂首阔步地冒着风雪行走着一个不知疲倦的人，即是当他重病缠身时也从来像平时那样精力盛旺。……当我们倾听这部交响乐的慢板段落时，我们听到的不仅是整个苏联人民的声音，这里可以听到全世界工人阶级的对敌人的罪行的愤慨和对未来的无限向往之情。深刻的抒情性使这部史诗性的作品增加了无限的感染力量，倾吐了像是压倒一切的神圣的热情。
    当我们听了这部交响乐的演出之后，我们可以自豪地说，这个慢板段落是交响乐文献中的重要篇章。这个由弦乐器奏出的主题的内容，中央音乐学院学生管弦乐队淋漓尽致地表现出来了——在肃穆的悼念的深处是对祖国对社会主义事业的诚挚的热爱，在悲愤的情感中包含着对未来的无限向往。革命者是无畏的人，革命艺术是永远和颓丧失望的情感绝缘的！即是当星海使用主导动机的手法时，也是从思想感情的表达、音乐形象的创造出发的，我们只要随手举出几个例证便足以说明一切。《国际歌》主题最初的一个变形是描写苏联人民的和平劳动生活的，这是一个新的牧歌风的音调。这个主题在德寇入侵苏联后再次出现时，急促的音节和附点的使用使这个主题表现了愤慨中的不可抑制的力量。紧接着的变形是一个切分音后的快速的句子，形象地表现了苏联人民的奋起应战和英勇斗争。终于，《国际歌》主题像潮水一般地此起彼伏，一声声地像进军和冲锋的号角……这里，基础于形象性的现实主义手法和标题原则可以当之无愧地被称为典范！我们认为，如果说这部交响乐还有不足之处，是在慢板段落出现的前后，在结构上稍嫌松懈，不能更高度地集中概括表现苏联人民愈战愈强的英雄形象。而这一点，我们是有义务来进行一些必要的、严肃认真的订正工作，通过不断的演出，根据群众的反映加以再创造——演出的解释和处理，这部交响乐必将是我国交响乐文献宝库中的一个重要珍藏！
