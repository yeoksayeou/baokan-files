Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th: The broad masses of steel rolling workers on Shanghai's iron and steel front are producing steel products needed for national construction in accordance with quality, quantity, and variety.

Since the third quarter, the city's output of finished steel products has increased month by month. In October, the pass rate of steel products reached 99.56%, of which the first-class product rate reached 97.7%. In the past ten months, the city has successfully trial-produced 109 new varieties of steel. Among them are seamless steel pipes to support fertilizer equipment, deformed ribbed steel to support the manufacture of combine harvesters, support steel for underground tunneling in coal mines, as well as medium and light rails, ship plates, etc.

In order to roll steel products of large quantity, good quality and many varieties, Shanghai's steel rolling workers have launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Many steel rolling sections and workshops have realized mechanization, semi-mechanization, automated mechanization and automation, which greatly reduces the labor intensity of workers and improves the efficiency of steel rolling production. After the Xinhu Iron and Steel Plant realized 111 innovation projects this year, the number of production workers was reduced from 117 to 71, and the hourly output was increased from more than 20 tons to more than 40 tons. The thin plate workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 has more than doubled its production capacity than the designed level due to the realization of mechanized feeding and multi-layer rolling on most rolling mills, and the quality of the products has also been improved compared with the past, and large-size thin steel plates can be rolled. In early October, after receiving a large number of orders for agricultural machinery steel from Hunan, Anhui and other places, Shanghai Cold Rolling Strip Steel Plant immediately launched a daily red competition to compare quality, compare output, and compare safe production, and the plant completed the rolling task of this batch of agricultural machinery steel five days ahead of schedule. The ribbed steel for combine harvesters rolled by the first branch of Xinhu Iron and Steel Plant is prone to winding accidents during rolling. The workers of this factory overcame the difficulties encountered in rolling this kind of steel and rolled out this kind of steel.

    在增加产量的同时努力增加品种
    上海制成百余种新钢材
    据新华社上海19日电　上海钢铁战线上的广大轧钢工人，按质、按量、按品种生产国家建设需用钢材。
    三季度以来，全市成品钢材产量一月高过一月。10月份钢材的合格率达到99.56％，其中一级品率达到97.7％。十个月来，全市试制成功钢材新品种有一百零九种。其中，有支援化肥设备的无缝钢管，支援制造联合收割机用的异形肋骨钢，支援煤矿井下掘进用的支撑钢以及中型和轻型钢轨，船用钢板等。
    上海的轧钢工人，为了轧制数量大、质量好、品种多的钢材，开展了技术革新和技术革命运动。很多轧钢工段、车间实现了机械化、半机械化和自动化半自动化，大大地减轻了工人的劳动强度，提高了轧钢生产效率。新沪钢铁厂今年实现了一百十一个革新项目后，生产工人由原来一百一十七人减少到七十一人，小时产量由二十多吨提高到四十多吨。上钢三厂薄板车间由于在大部分轧机上实现机械化上料和多层轧制，生产能力超过设计水平一倍以上，产品的质量也比过去有所提高，并且可以轧制大规格的薄钢板。10月上旬，上海冷轧带钢厂接到来自湖南、安徽等地的大批农业机械钢材的订货任务后，立即掀起了比质量、比产量、比安全生产的日日红竞赛，全厂提前五天完成了这批农机钢材的轧制任务。新沪钢铁厂第一分厂轧制的联合收割机用的肋骨钢，轧制起来容易发生绕辊事故。这个厂的工人，克服了轧制这种钢材中遇到的困难，轧出了这种钢材。
