Xinhua News Agency, London, 28th -- In the major British commercial port of Liverpool, there are over 80,000 houses utterly unfit for habitation, where living conditions are extremely poor.

    A reporter for the British newspaper *The Observer* recently described the scene in one such slum dwelling: "In a dark little room on the ground floor, the only light came from a small stove on which something was cooking. A large bed without bedding took up most of the room." Sleeping on this bed were seventy-two-year-old Carolina Sales, her thirty-two-year-old daughter, and four grandchildren: eight years old, four years old, two years old, and eleven months old.

    The daughter, Margaret Rowan, told the reporter, "We have no gas, no electricity, only cold water in the basement. We use oil lamps, and to go to the toilet, we have to cross the street to my aunt's house."

    The reporter said that on the third floor of this slum lived a blind old man and his wife. "To get to his room, you have to walk up a ladder that looks about to collapse, and buckets are hung at the top because it leaks when it rains."

    A mother who is about to have her fifth child told the reporter about the rampant rats in the slum. She said they even come out during the day. Once, a rat crawled into her child's bed.

    The reporter also pointed out that although the slums lack the most basic sanitation, the rent is very high.

    英利物浦贫民窟一片惨状
    八万多所房屋根本不堪居住
    六口之家无铺无盖同睡一床
    新华社伦敦28日电　在英国大商埠利物浦市有八万多所根本不适于居住的房屋，那里的生活条件极端恶劣。
    英国《观察家报》记者最近描写贫民窟中一所房屋的景象说：“在房屋底层的一间漆黑的小屋子里，唯一的一点光亮是从煮着什么食物的小火炉里发出的火光。一张没有铺盖的大床占去了屋子的一大半地方”。在这张床上睡着七十二岁的卡罗利娜·赛尔斯，她的三十二岁的女儿和四个外孙：八岁的、四岁的、两岁的和十一个月的。
    这个女儿马加雷特·罗文对记者说，“我们没有煤气，没有电，只有地下室里有冷水。我们使用的是油灯，上厕所得穿过大街到姨母家去”。
    记者说，在这个贫民窟的第三层上住着一个瞎眼老头和他的妻子。“要到他的房间去必须走过一个眼看要倒塌的梯子，在梯口上吊着水桶，因为下雨时这里漏水”。
    一个即将生第五个孩子的母亲对记者讲了贫民窟老鼠猖獗的情况。她说，它们甚至白天出动。有一次，一只老鼠钻到她孩子的被窝里去了。
    记者还指出，虽然贫民窟没有最起码的卫生条件，但是房租却很高。
