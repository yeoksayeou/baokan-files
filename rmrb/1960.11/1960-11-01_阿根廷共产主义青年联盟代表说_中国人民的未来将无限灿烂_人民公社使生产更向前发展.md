Latin American Friends Highly Praise the Great Achievements of China's Three Red Banners
    Argentine Communist Youth League Representative Says:
    The Future of the Chinese People Will Be Infinitely Bright
    People's Communes Promote Greater Development of Production

    Luis Osvaldo Naglestai, Provincial Secretary of the Argentine Communist Youth League, who is currently visiting China, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that through this visit, he has seen that the Chinese people live a happy life under the leadership of the Communist Party, and their future will be even more infinitely bright. Chinese youth receive meticulous care from the government and are able to fully develop their talents.

    Salomon Waltner, Head of Ideological Education Work of the Buenos Aires Municipal Committee of the Argentine Communist Youth League, said that this visit allows him to draw the conclusion that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system, which is the message we want to bring back to Argentine youth. He said that he greatly admires China's achievements in the steel, coal and machinery industries and believes that the Chinese people will definitely catch up with Britain ahead of schedule.

    Both Argentine representatives mentioned that through this visit, they saw that the people's communes provide conditions for greater development of production. Women have been completely liberated, and contrary to what the imperialists say, the communes have not only not broken up families, but have made families more harmonious.

    They pointed out that only the capitalist system breaks up families. In capitalist society, unemployment is severe, forcing people to travel to other places and migrate everywhere, resulting in the separation of wives and children.

    They also pointed out that in capitalist countries, many old people beg from door to door. In socialist China, homes for the elderly have been established, where they spend their happy later years.

    They also mentioned that in the rural people's communes of Guangzhou and Tianjin, they saw male and female farmers happily working in the fields, using various methods to increase production. They pointed out: The imperialists' slander that the Chinese people's communes practice forced labor is completely a lie.

    拉丁美洲友人盛赞我国三面红旗的伟大成就
    阿根廷共产主义青年联盟代表说
    中国人民的未来将无限灿烂
    人民公社使生产更向前发展
    正在我国访问的阿根廷共产主义青年联盟省委书记路易斯·奥斯加尔·纳格莱戴向新华社记者说，通过这次访问，他看到中国人民在共产党领导下过着幸福的生活，他们的未来将更是无限灿烂。中国青年得到政府无微不至的关怀，能够充分发挥他们的才能。
    阿根廷共产主义青年联盟布宜诺斯市委思想教育工作负责人萨罗蒙·华特纳说，这次访问可以得出这样的结论：社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越，这是我们要带回给阿根廷青年的信息。他说，他非常钦佩地看到中国在钢铁、煤和机械业方面的成就，并相信中国人民一定能提前赶上英国。
    这两位阿根廷代表都谈到，通过这次访问看到人民公社提供了使生产更向前发展的条件。妇女得到彻底解放，与帝国主义所说相反，公社不但没有拆散家庭，而且使家庭更为和睦。
    他们指出，只有资本主义制度才是拆散家庭。在资本主义社会中，失业情况严重，迫使人们奔走他乡，到处移民，妻离子散。
    他们还指出，在资本主义国家中，许多老人沿门求乞。而在社会主义中国，为老人们建立了敬老院，在那里他们度着幸福的晚年。
    他们还谈到在广州、天津农村人民公社里，看到男女农民兴高彩烈地在田里劳动，用各种办法增加生产。他们指出：帝国主义者污蔑中国人民公社实行强迫劳动完全是谎言。
