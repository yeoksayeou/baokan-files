    Lü Genze Youth Shock Brigade Increases Enthusiasm

    (Our dispatch) Lü Genze, a model agricultural worker of Jilin Province and a knowledge youth, and the members of the youth production team he leads (namely, the Hailan Production Team) have been competing with the nationally famous Xing Yanzi and the Yanzi Production Shock Brigade to contribute to the great development of agriculture and grain production. After the competition, their enthusiasm has greatly increased. The autumn harvest production has been successfully completed, not only completing the threshing and grain separation and autumn plowing tasks, but also accumulating a large amount of high-quality fertilizer, actively creating conditions for winning another bumper harvest next year.

    After in-depth study and discussion of editorials on the great development of agriculture and grain production and Xing Yanzi's exemplary deeds, the Lü Genze Youth Production Team further strengthened its determination to be red and expert in the countryside. All team members have formulated personal red and expert plans and launched a competition to "learn from Xing Yanzi and strive to be production experts." One day, Lü Genze found that the team did not have enough rope, so he used his rest time to twist rope, twisting more than one hundred ropes in a row. His hands cracked, but he insisted on twisting. Team members Pu Songhao, Pu Zaifan, Sun Chengyu and others overcame various difficulties in harvesting rice and achieved rapid rice harvesting, each creating records of harvesting five mu, four mu, and three and a half mu of rice per day. Jin Chunhua, a girl who just turned eighteen this year, was originally working in the cafeteria. When the captain asked her to bundle rice, she went to the field before dawn. The rice was covered with frost, and her hands were very cold, but she thought of Sister Yanzi digging ice holes to fish in the cold winter. Immediately, she was full of energy, and she bundled more than 4,500 bundles of rice on the first day, and maintained high yields every day thereafter. The entire team originally planned to complete the harvesting and bundling of more than ten hectares of rice in seven days, but it was completed in only four days. In order to complete the threshing and grain separation tasks as soon as possible, they launched a high-yield grain separation movement, achieving an average of more than 9,000 bundles of grain separation per person, increasing efficiency by 50% compared to previous years. Under the call of the commune party committee to "cut, pull, thresh cleanly, and cherish every grain of grain," all the team members ensured that no grain was lost, there were no ears of grain in the bundles, no grain was left on the ground, and the threshing was meticulous, increasing grain production a lot.

    In order to win another bumper harvest next year, the Lü Genze Youth Production Team has summarized this year's production experience and formulated a production plan for 1961.

    吕根泽青年突击队干劲倍增
    本报讯　吉林省农业劳动模范、知识青年吕根泽和他领导的青年生产队（即海兰生产队）队员在和全国著名的邢燕子及燕子生产突击队队员开展了为大办农业、大办粮食立功的革命竞赛以后，干劲倍增，秋收生产告捷，不仅完成打场脱谷和秋翻地任务，而且积攒了大量的优质肥料，为再夺明年丰收积极创造条件。
    吕根泽青年生产队队员通过深入学习和讨论了有关大办农业、大办粮食等社论和邢燕子的模范事迹后，进一步坚定了红在农村、专在农村的决心，全队队员都制定了个人的红专规划，并开展了“学、赶邢燕子，争做生产能手”的竞赛。有一天，吕根泽发现队里绳子不够用，即利用休息时间搓绳，一连搓了一百多根，手搓裂了口，还坚持搓。队员朴松好、朴在范、孙成郁等在割稻时排除种种困难，做到快速割稻，各创造了日割稻五亩、四亩、三亩半的纪录。今年刚满十八岁的姑娘金春华，本来在食堂劳动，当队长让她去捆稻子时，她天不亮就下地去了，水稻上落满霜花，非常冻手，但她想到燕子姐在数九寒天，还挖冰窟窿打鱼的事迹。马上全身有了劲，第一天就捆了四千五百多捆水稻，以后天天保持高产。全队原计划七天完成割完捆完十公顷多地的水稻，结果只用了四天就完成了。为了早日完成打场脱谷任务，他们开展了脱谷高产运动，做到每人平均脱谷九千多捆，比往年提高效率50％。全体队员在公社党委“割拉打净，珍惜每一粒粮”的号召下，做到了颗粒不掉，捆里没穗，拉地不落，脱谷细致，增产了很多粮食。
    为了再夺明年丰收，吕根泽青年生产队已经总结了今年的生产经验，并制定出1961年的生产计划。
