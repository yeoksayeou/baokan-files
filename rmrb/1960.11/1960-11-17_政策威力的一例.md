    An Example of the Power of Policy
    Bai Sheng
    Yang Shengxuan, the Party Branch Secretary of the Xihu Brigade of the Xigang Commune in Helan County, said: "Once the masses grasp the Party's policies, they will turn into a tremendous material force." Yang Shengxuan made this statement after the Xihu Brigade conscientiously implemented the Party's policies, overcame natural disasters, and achieved continuous leaps in production. It is a profound understanding derived from practice and has solid factual basis.
    More than a decade ago, Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Talks to the Editorial Staff of the Jin Sui Daily": "Our policies should not only be known to the leaders and cadres but also to the broad masses. ... When the masses know the truth and have a common goal, they will work together wholeheartedly.... When the masses are united, everything becomes easier." In the past, during the revolutionary war, millions of examples proved the correctness of this statement. Now, in the cause of socialist construction, millions more examples prove the correctness of this statement. The achievements of the Xihu Brigade are one such example. Under normal circumstances, after a disaster, there will be some losses. However, as long as the masses are organized and everyone strives "wholeheartedly" in every possible way for a "common goal," then the result will change to a certain extent. Either the losses brought about by natural disasters are reduced, turning severe disasters into minor ones, or minor disasters into no disasters; or, even better, like the Xihu Brigade, increased production can be achieved in a year of disaster. Of course, due to the different severity of natural disasters, the results of disaster resistance in various regions cannot be exactly the same. But the key is whether the broad masses are wholeheartedly involved in the struggle against the disaster.
    However, how can we unite the masses? Only under the guidance of the Party's policies can the masses be united. Because only the Party's policies can correctly point out the "common goal" for the masses, as well as the path to reach the "common goal" and the methods to be adopted. The experience of the Xihu Brigade is like this. Initially, the cadres and the masses had different understandings of overcoming natural disasters, with various different ideas, and their hearts were not united. But once the masses were fully mobilized to discuss the Party's relevant policies, the situation immediately changed. Everyone understood the Party's policies, knew the truth, and their hearts were united, making it easier to resist the disaster. This is true for disaster resistance, and it is also true for other work. The power of the Party's policies lies here. It is precisely because of this that we repeatedly emphasize that all cadres must establish a strong policy concept in their minds and truly implement it in their actual work. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Policy and tactics are the life of the Party; leading comrades at all levels must pay full attention to them and must not be careless." These words are so earnest and have great guiding significance for all our work forever. We must always remember them and never forget them.

    政策威力的一例
    柏生
    贺兰县习岗公社西湖大队党支部书记杨生选说：“党的政策一旦被群众掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。”杨生选的这句话，是在西湖大队认真贯彻党的政策，战胜了自然灾害，生产持续跃进以后说的。它是从实践中得来的深刻体会，有着确凿的事实根据。
    十几年前，毛泽东同志在“对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话”中说过这样的话：“我们的政策，不光要使领导者知道，干部知道，还要使广大的群众知道。……群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做……。群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。”过去，在革命战争中，有千百万件事例证明了这段话的正确。现在，在社会主义建设事业中，又有千百万件事例证明了这段话的正确。西湖大队的事迹就是一例。在一般情况下，受灾之后，将会受到一定的损失。但是只要把群众组织起来，使大家为着“共同的目的”千方百计地“齐心”奋斗，那么，结果就会发生一定的变化。或者减轻了自然灾害所带来的损失，使重灾变成轻灾，使轻灾变成无灾；更好的像西湖大队那样，还能在灾年获得增产。当然由于自然灾害的严重程度不同，各地抗灾的结果不可能完全一样。但决定的关键，就在于是否使广大群众齐心地投入到抗灾斗争中去。
    可是，怎样才能够使群众齐心呢？只有在党的政策的指引下，群众才能齐心。因为只有党的政策才能为群众正确地指明“共同的目的”和到达“共同的目的”所要走的道路，所要采取的办法。西湖大队的经验就是这样。开初，干部和群众对于战胜自然灾害的认识不统一，有着各种不同的想法，心是不齐的。但一经充分发动群众讨论了党的各项有关政策，情况就立即改变，大家知道了党的政策，知道了真理，心就齐了，抗灾的事情也就好办了。抗灾如此，其它工作也是如此。党的政策的威力正在这里，正是因为这样，我们才一再强调所有的干部都必须在思想上树立起坚强的政策观念，并将它真正贯彻到实际工作中去。毛泽东同志说：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”这段话是如何的语重心长，对于我们做一切工作永远有巨大的指导意义。我们一定要永远记住，不可忘记。
