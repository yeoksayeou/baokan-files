    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 10th. Workers in the German Democratic Republic are responding to West Germany's provocative act of unilaterally terminating the trade agreement between the two Germanys with soaring production enthusiasm and new production achievements. Steelworkers overfulfilled the state's steel rolling production plan for October by 26,000 tons.

    The news that West Germany unilaterally announced the termination of the trade agreement between the two Germanys at the end of September aroused immense indignation among workers throughout the German Democratic Republic, who expressed their determination to respond to West Germany's provocation with practical actions. Steelworkers expressed their determination to further develop the "Produce More Steel for the Republic" competition. A member of the "Tenth Anniversary" production team of the No. 6 Martin furnace at the Gröditz Steel Plant told reporters: We will never yield to West Germany's provocative actions. The steel casters at this steel plant have not produced a single defective product since the competition began. At the initiative of the "Makarenko" production team at the Freital Steel Plant in the Dresden District, all workers in the plant increased the original plan to overproduce 6,400 tons of rolled steel by the end of this year to overproduce 7,000 tons. Now all the workers in the plant are planning to increase production by another 1,000 tons of rolled steel. Charts showing the progress of the competition between production teams, workshops, and plants have been erected everywhere inside and outside the plant's workshops. Each production team holds daily meetings to study measures to shorten production time, reduce losses, and improve operating methods. The nationwide labor competition among major steel plants to overproduce 64,000 tons of rolled steel from the beginning of September to the end of this year has achieved preliminary results. After two months of hard work in September and October, workers at these factories had completed more than 34,500 tons by the end of October.

    The output of pig iron also increased in October. In the first twenty days of October, the national pig iron output exceeded the state plan by more than 3,000 tons. Workers at the Stalin Iron and Steel United Enterprise in Stalin City carried out socialist mutual assistance in the competition. In October, they created a new record of producing more than 110,000 tons of pig iron, exceeding the state plan by 735 tons.

    The good news from the steel front has driven the production of electricity, lignite, and other departments, presenting a new atmosphere on the industrial front of the German Democratic Republic. Under the slogan of "Supporting Steel Workers with More Power," seven power plants across the country participated in the competition in October. The Hirsfeld Power Plant guaranteed to increase its power generation by 10,000 kilowatt-hours in the fourth quarter. Workers at the Tratendorf Power Plant proposed to supply maximum power even during peak load hours. The third plant of this factory guaranteed to supply 156,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity during peak load hours.

    Lignite workers in the Cottbus, Halle, Leipzig, Karl-Marx-Stadt and other districts also threw themselves into the competition under the encouragement of the slogan of supporting steel production. In the first half of October, the Senftenberg lignite enterprise produced 76,000 tons more lignite, most of which was supplied to steel mills. Workers at the "Franz Mehring" lignite plant guaranteed to produce more than 14,000 tons of lignite briquettes and 396,000 tons of raw coal by the end of the year. Coal miners in the Zwickau and Bitterfeld mining areas greatly increased their daily coal output in the competition.

    以实际行动回击西德的挑衅
    德工人超额完成上月轧钢计划
    钢铁战线上的捷报使工业战线出现一片新气象
    新华社柏林10日电　德意志民主共和国工人正以高涨的生产热情和新的生产成就，来回击西德片面宣布中断两个德国间的贸易协定的挑衅行动。钢铁工人们在10月份超额二万六千吨完成了国家轧钢生产计划。
    西德在9月底片面宣布中断两个德国间的贸易协定的消息，激起了德意志民主共和国各地工人的无比愤慨，他们纷纷表示要以实际行动回答西德的挑衅。钢铁工人们表示要进一步展开“为共和国生产更多的钢”的竞赛。格勒迪茨钢铁厂六号马丁炉“十周年”生产队的一个队员对记者说：我们绝不会向西德的挑衅行动屈服。这个钢铁厂的铸钢工人在竞赛开始后，一直没有出过废品。德累斯顿专区弗赖塔耳钢铁厂在“马卡连柯”生产队的倡议下，全厂工人把原定到今年年底超额生产六千四百吨轧钢的计划，提高为超额生产七千吨。现在全厂工人又酝酿再增产一千吨轧钢。这个钢厂的车间内外到处树立起绘有各生产队、车间和厂际间的竞赛进度的图表。各生产队每天开会研究缩短生产时间、减少损耗、改进操作方法等措施。从9月初开始到今年年底，超额生产六万四千吨轧钢的全国各大钢铁厂的劳动竞赛已经获得初步成果。经过9、10两个月的奋战，到10月底，这些工厂的工人已完成三万四千五百多吨。
    10月份生铁的产量也有了增长。在10月份的头二十天里，全国生铁产量超额三千多吨完成国家计划。斯大林城的斯大林钢铁联合企业的工人们，在竞赛中进行社会主义互助，10月份他们创造了生产十一万多吨生铁的新成绩，超额七百三十五吨完成国家计划。
    钢铁战线上的捷报，带动了电力、褐煤等部门的生产，使德意志民主共和国工业战线上展现一片新气象。在“以更多的动力支援钢铁工人”的口号下，10月里全国先后有七个发电厂参加了竞赛。希尔斯费尔德发电厂保证要在第四季度把发电量提高一万度。特腊滕多夫发电厂工人倡议在高负荷时间，也要最大限度地供应电力。这个厂的第三厂保证在高负荷时间能供应十五万六千度电力。
    科特布斯、哈雷、来比锡、卡尔·马克思斯塔特等专区的褐煤工人也在支援钢铁增产的口号的鼓舞下投入竞赛。在10月的上半月，森夫滕堡褐煤企业多生产了七万六千吨褐煤，其中绝大部分是供应炼钢厂的。“弗朗茨·美赫林”褐煤厂工人保证到年底多生产一万四千多吨褐煤砖和三十九万六千吨原煤。兹维考和比特菲尔德矿区煤矿工人在竞赛中大大提高了每天采煤量。
