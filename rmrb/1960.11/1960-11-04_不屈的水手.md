    The Indomitable Sailor
    Cheng Guangrui
    ——To the crew of the Albanian "Ali Kelmendi" ship
    On October 17th, the Albanian steamship "Ali Kelmendi" was attacked by a storm while sailing in the Adriatic Sea and faced the danger of sinking, and was forced to enter the port of Gruž in Yugoslavia to take shelter from the wind. The Yugoslav authorities insisted that they remove an article exposing Yugoslav modern revisionism from the wall of the steamship. The steamship party organization meeting decided to reject this provocative demand. The Yugoslav authorities violated international maritime law and refused to allow the steamship to take shelter from the wind. The crew resolutely sailed away from the port into international waters, braving the stormy waves and overcoming numerous difficulties, and finally safely returned to the port of Durrës, Albania, on the 18th. In this late autumn when chrysanthemums are in full bloom, my heart flies to the port of Durrës. Let me offer a bouquet of chrysanthemums from Beijing. Dear brothers, please accept my greetings! I seem to see a jubilation in the port, with flowers, flags, and a sea of
  people welcoming the victorious return of the indomitable heroes, welcoming the glorious sailors of the "Land of Eagles." I seem to walk to the sun-drenched deck,
  listening to you tell about the battle on the Adriatic Sea, my heart flying with your spirit, sinking and floating with this steamship in the stormy waves. In that stormy sea, where is the lighthouse?——Marxism-Leninism is the lighthouse! In that vast darkness, where is the starlight?——The Party's line is the bright North Star! How can you retreat in the face of raging waves? How can you bow your heads in front of revisionism? You bravely move forward, tearing through the darkness, smashing the treacherous countercurrent! When dawn rises from the sea, the wind calms, a flock of seagulls flies in the blue sky,
  you carry a ship full of colorful clouds and songs, and finally victoriously return to the port of your motherland. This extraordinary feat is exciting and encourages people to fight bravely for the truth. The waves of the Adriatic Sea are like a hymn, forever praising you, the indomitable sailors!

    ——给阿尔巴尼亚“阿里·卡尔门迪号”船员
    10月17日，阿尔巴尼亚“阿里·卡尔门迪号”汽船在亚德里亚海上航行时遭到暴风雨的袭击，面临沉没的危险，曾被迫开进南斯拉夫的格鲁日港口避风。南斯拉夫当局硬要他们拿掉汽船墙上的一篇揭露南斯拉夫现代修正主义的文章，汽船党组织会议决定拒绝这种挑衅的要求。南斯拉夫当局竟违反国际航海公法，拒绝让这艘汽船避风。船员们毅然驾船离港驶向公海，冒着惊涛骇浪，突破重重困难，终于在18日安全地返回阿尔巴尼亚都拉斯港。在这菊花盛开的深秋，我的心飞向都拉斯港口，让我献上一束北京的菊花，亲爱的兄弟，请接受我的问候！我仿佛看到港口上一片欢腾，到处是鲜花、旗帜、海潮般的
  人流，欢迎不屈的英雄们胜利归来，欢迎“鹰之国”光荣的水手。我仿佛走到阳光灿烂的甲板
  上，听你们讲述亚德里亚海上的战
  斗，我的心和你们的神采一起飞
  扬，和这汽船在惊涛骇浪中一起沉
  浮。在那暴风雨的海上，哪里是灯
  塔？——马克思列宁主义就是灯
  塔！在那茫茫的黑夜里，哪里有星
  光？——党的路线就是明亮的北
  斗！你们怎能在狂风巨浪面前退
  后？你们怎能在修正主义面前低
  头？你们披风斩浪骄傲地前进，撕裂黑夜，撞碎险恶的逆流！当黎明从海上升起，风平浪静，碧海蓝天上飞舞着一群群海
  鸥，你们载着满船彩霞，一片歌声，终于胜利地返回祖国的港口。这不平凡的事迹激动人心，鼓舞人们为真理英勇地战斗。亚德里亚海的波涛像一曲赞
  歌，永远歌颂你们，不屈的水手！
