Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 17th: The Soviet Union has made remarkable achievements in basic construction since 1959, when it began implementing the Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. According to the latest data, a total of more than two thousand industrial enterprises equipped with modern technology have been built and put into production or are about to be completed in the Soviet Union in 1959 and 1960. This means that an average of three new industrial enterprises are completed every day. In addition, many workshops have been renovated and expanded in existing enterprises.

In the past two years, the progress of basic construction in the Soviet Union has been very rapid. The control figures of the Seven-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy stipulate that the total basic investment in construction and installation projects nationwide in 1959 and 1960 should be 288.8 billion rubles, but in fact, 300 billion rubles will be completed. During 1959 and 1960, the growth rate of construction and installation work averaged 12% per year, while the original plan stipulated 10%. In the first half of this year alone, the amount of construction work completed in various parts of the Soviet Union was more than twice the total amount of construction work completed during the entire First Five-Year Plan period (1928-1932).

Large-scale basic construction work has been carried out in some major sectors of the national economy. In the iron and steel industry, a total of seven blast furnaces have been built and put into production in the Soviet Union from 1959 to the present. It is estimated that by the end of 1960, the Soviet Union will have one or two new blast furnaces completed, one of which, built in Krivoy Rog, has a volume of 2,000 cubic meters and will be the largest blast furnace in the world. In steelmaking, the Soviet Union will build a total of ten large open-hearth furnaces this year, which are distributed in steel plants in Cherepovets, Orsk-Khalilovo, and Nizhny Tagil. Three large electric furnaces have now been completed. An electric furnace that was recently put into production at the Chelyabinsk Steel Plant produces tens of thousands of tons of high-quality alloy steel annually. In terms of rolling steel, the Soviet Union has built four new large rolling mills this year, including two large steel plate rolling mills, each of which can produce 3.8 million tons of steel plate annually. Two more large rolling mills will be completed by the end of the year. Due to the acceleration of basic construction work, the production capacity of the iron and steel industry is rapidly increasing. The equipment put into production this year alone can produce 4.8 million tons of iron, 4.3 million tons of steel, and 5 million tons of steel products annually.

As one of the key industrial sectors developed by the Soviet Union, the chemical industry has also undergone large-scale basic construction. Since the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan, the Ryazan and Engels artificial and synthetic fiber plants, the Baku and Krasnoyarsk tire plants, the Sumgait synthetic rubber plant, and many other enterprises have been built and put into production. In 1960, the Soviet Union's investment in the construction and expansion of chemical industrial enterprises increased by 2.4 times compared with 1957. The amount of construction work carried out in the chemical industry in 1960 alone was equal to the total amount of construction work completed in the four years before the start of the Seven-Year Plan. In order to concentrate the use of financial, material, and human resources, the Soviet Union stipulated fifty chemical industrial construction projects of great significance to the national economy this year, including artificial and synthetic fiber plants, artificial rubber plants, plastics plants, and synthetic ethanol plants.

1960 is a year of great significance for the basic construction of the Soviet electric power industry. This year, the Soviet Union will put more than 6 million kilowatts of new generating capacity into production, which is an increase of about 1 million kilowatts over the average annual generating capacity put into production in the past. This year, the Soviet Union is building a total of forty large thermal power stations and twenty-five hydroelectric power stations, some of which have been completed and put into production.

The rapid growth in the production of building materials is an important factor in the Soviet Union's significant achievements in basic construction. Compared with 1953, the Soviet Union used almost twice as much cement this year, and almost thirteen times as many reinforced concrete components. Since the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan, Soviet cement production has increased by an average of 5.5 million tons per year. In this way, the production volume in 1962 can reach 56 million to 57 million tons, which exceeds the current production level of the United States—54 million tons. In the past seven years, the production of reinforced concrete components in the Soviet Union has increased tenfold. This year's production will reach 29 million cubic meters. In the production of reinforced concrete components, the Soviet Union has far surpassed all capitalist countries and ranks first in the world.

    苏联两年来基本建设进展迅速
    两千多座新的现代化工业企业已经投入生产或即将建成
    新华社莫斯科17日电　苏联自从1959年执行发展国民经济七年计划的两年以来，在基本建设方面已经取得了显著的成就。根据最新材料，1959年和1960年苏联总共有两千多座用现代技术装备起来的工业企业已经建成并投入生产或即将建成，这就是说，平均每天有三座新的工业企业建成。此外，在原有的企业中还改建和扩建了许多车间。
    最近两年来，苏联的基本建设工作进展十分迅速。发展国民经济七年计划的控制数字规定，1959年和1960年全国建筑和安装工程的基本投资应为二千八百八十八亿卢布，而实际上将可以完成三千亿卢布。在1959年和1960年期间，建筑和安装工程量的增长速度平均每年为12％，而原计划的规定是10％。仅今年上半年，苏联各地完成的建筑工程量就比整个第一个五年计划期间（1928—1932年）完成的全部建筑工程量还多一倍。
    国民经济的一些主要部门都进行了规模宏伟的基本建设工作。在钢铁工业方面，从1959年起到目前为止，在苏联一共有七座高炉建成并投入生产，据估计，到1960年年底，苏联还将有一座到两座新高炉建成，其中在克里沃罗格建设的一座高炉的容积达二千立方米，它将是目前世界上最大的高炉。在炼钢方面今年苏联将总共建成十座大型平炉，它们分布在切列波维次，奥尔斯克—哈里洛夫斯克和下塔吉尔等地的钢铁厂中。现在已经建成了三座大型电炉。不久前在车里雅宾斯克钢铁厂投入生产的一座电炉，每年生产数以万吨计的优质合金钢。在轧钢方面，苏联今年已经建成了四台新的大型轧钢机，其中包括两台大型轧钢板机，每台每年可以生产钢板三百八十万吨。到年底以前还将有两台大型轧钢机建成。由于加速了基本建设工作，钢铁工业的生产能力在迅速增加，仅在今年投入生产的设备，每年就可以生产四百八十万吨铁、四百三十万吨钢，五百万吨钢材。
    作为苏联重点发展的工业部门之一的化学工业，也进行了大规模的基本建设。自从执行七年计划以来，建成并投入生产的有梁赞和恩格斯城的人造和合成纤维厂、巴库和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克的轮胎厂、苏姆加伊特城的合成橡胶厂以及其它许多企业。1960年苏联用于新建和扩建化学工业企业的投资比1957年增加了二点四倍。1960年一年在化学工业方面进行的建设工程量就等于七年计划开始以前的四年中所完成的建设工程量的总和。为了集中使用财力、物力和人力，苏联今年规定了五十项对国民经济具有重大意义的化学工业建设工程，其中包括人造和合成纤维厂，人造橡胶厂，塑料厂和合成乙醇厂等。
    1960年是对苏联电力工业基本建设具有重要意义的一年。这一年苏联将使六百多万瓩的新的发电能力投入生产，即比以往平均每年投入生产的发电能力增加约一百万瓩。今年苏联总共建设四十座大型火电站和二十五座水电站，其中已有一些电力站建成并投入生产。
    建筑材料生产的迅速增长，是苏联在基本建设方面取得显著成就的重要因素之一。同1953年比较，苏联今年使用的水泥几乎增加了两倍，钢筋混凝土构件几乎增加了十三倍。七年计划执行以来，苏联水泥生产平均每年增加五百五十万吨，这样，1962年的生产量就可以达到五千六百万到五千七百万吨，即超过美国目前的生产水平——五千四百万吨。在过去的七年中，苏联钢筋混凝土构件的生产增长了十倍。今年的生产量将达到二千九百万立方米。在钢筋混凝土构件的生产方面，苏联已经远远超过了所有资本主义国家而占世界第一位。
