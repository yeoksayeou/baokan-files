The letter pointed out that taking the welcome step of establishing diplomatic and trade relations with all countries in the world is the most effective response to imperialist pressure and interference.

The letter said that the WFTU guarantees its full support to Cuba as the Cuban Workers' Confederation and the Cuban people face the US government's economic blockade and the preparation for a military aggression against Cuba's freedom and independence. The WFTU concluded by requesting the world's working class and trade unions to pay attention to the seriousness of the threat against Cuba and calling on them to express resolute support for the Cuban people.

    据新华社布拉格4日电　世界工会联合会3日在写给古巴工人联合会的一封信中说：世界工会联合会热烈地欢迎古巴把美国垄断资本和银行以及国内的大垄断资本完全收归国有。
    这封信说，世界工会联合会庆贺古巴工人联合会和全体工人阶级的巨大的责任感，以及他们在解决由于国内新的经济情况而产生的困难问题上所表现出的能力。这封信指出，采取同世界一切国家建立外交和贸易关系这种受人欢迎的措施，是对帝国主义压力和干涉的最有效的回答。
    这封信说，在古巴工人联合会和古巴人民面临美国政府的经济封锁，以及正在准备对古巴的自由和独立进行军事侵略的情况下，世界工会联合会保证全力支持古巴。世界工会联合会最后要求全世界的工人阶级和工会注意对古巴的威胁的严重性，并号召他们对古巴人民表示坚决的支持。
