    Deep into the Furnace, Careful Analysis, Find the Gaps, Take Countermeasures
    Changchun Stokers Vigorously Catch Up with Provincial Coal-Saving Pace-Setters
    (Our newspaper, Changchun, 19th) The stokers of industrial enterprises in Changchun City are launching a coal-saving competition campaign. This competition started in the light industry system and has rapidly expanded to metallurgy, machinery, chemical industry, capital construction, food service and other industries, as well as government agencies, schools, hospitals, residents and other civilian heating units. The competition has achieved significant results, and coal consumption in various industries has decreased significantly. According to statistics, the average coal consumption per ton of coke refined in the city has decreased by 19.4% compared to before the competition, the coal consumption per ton of molten glass has decreased by 24%, and the coal consumption per 10,000 bricks burned has decreased by 30%.
    This coal-saving competition began with the activity of "detailed accounting and gap analysis." After mutual visits among stokers in various industries throughout the city, it was found that coal consumption varied greatly under the same conditions. For example, for the same Red Flag No. 2 coke oven, the coal consumption per ton of coke refined was 1.53 tons in some cases and 1.67 tons in others; the gap in the glass industry was nearly half a ton; and the gap in the brick-making industry reached as high as 1.1 tons per 10,000 bricks burned.
    In response to this situation of widely varying coal consumption, the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Changchun Federation of Trade Unions organized workers of the same trade to go deep into the furnace and explore the reasons and experiences for the high and low coal consumption. On this basis, the city established a group of coal-saving pace-setters in the metallurgy, machinery, light industry, capital construction, and civilian heating systems. At the same time, taking the promotion of advanced experience as the main link, a competition to learn from and catch up with the pace-setters was launched, as well as a counterpart competition between furnaces, kilns, shifts, and groups, striving to transform the advanced level of coal-saving pace-setters into the general level of stokers throughout the city. After the Changchun No. 1 Machinery Brick Factory created a new record of burning 10,000 bricks with 1.1 tons of coal, brick factories throughout the city sent people to learn from their experience and signed competition contracts. Within a week of the competition, most of the large kilns in brick factories throughout the city caught up with and surpassed the level of this workshop.
    The coal-saving competition among stokers in Changchun City has been closely integrated with the technical innovation movement from beginning to end, promoting each other. In order to find more ways to save coal, workers vigorously carried out equipment transformation and operational method innovation. The Changchun Asbestos Factory changed from burning coal inside the furnace to building the furnace outside to burn coal, which doubled the boiler steam output and saved 15% of coal per day. At the same time, water-cooled walls were added inside the furnace, so that the boiler heating area reached 100%, and the furnace outlet temperature increased from 1,030 degrees to 1,070 degrees. According to the past situation of low efficiency and high coal consumption of the whole plant's inverted kilns, the Changchun Thermal Insulation Material Factory completely transformed all the inverted kilns in the plant into high-temperature tunnel kilns, and installed pipelines to fully recover and utilize the waste heat. The plant's coal consumption was reduced by 86.34% compared with before the reform. (Attached picture)

### 深入炉旁　仔细分析　寻找差距　采取对策  长春司炉工人猛赶省煤标兵

    深入炉旁　仔细分析　寻找差距　采取对策
    长春司炉工人猛赶省煤标兵
    本报长春19日电　长春市工业企业的司炉工人，正在开展一个节约煤炭的竞赛运动。这次竞赛首先从轻工业系统开始，迅速地扩展到冶金、机械、化工、基本建设、饮食服务等行业以及机关、学校、医院、居民等民用取暖单位。竞赛运动已经取得显著的成效，各行各业的耗煤量显著下降。据统计，目前全市平均每炼一吨焦炭的耗煤量比竞赛前降低19.4％，每熔化一吨玻璃液的耗煤量降低24％，每烧一万块砖的耗煤量降低30％。
    这次节约煤炭的竞赛是从“算细账、找差距”的活动开始的。在全市各行各业司炉工人互相参观访问后，发现在同样条件下，耗煤量相差悬殊。例如同样的红旗二号焦炉，每炼一吨焦耗煤量有的为一点五三吨，有的是一点六七吨；玻璃行业的差距将近半吨；制砖工业每烧一万块砖的差距竟高达一点一吨。
    针对这种耗煤量相差悬殊的情况，中共长春市委和长春市总工会，组织同工种的工人深入炉旁多方探讨，寻找用煤量高低的原因和经验。在这个基础上，全市又在冶金、机械、轻工、基建和民用取暖等系统分别树立了一批节约用煤的标兵。同时，以推广先进经验为主要环节，掀起了学标兵、赶标兵的竞赛和炉与炉、窑与窑、班与班、组与组的对口竞赛，力求把节煤标兵的先进水平变成全市司炉工种的普遍水平。长春市第一机械制砖厂创造了用一点一吨煤烧一万块砖的新纪录后，全市各砖厂即派人来取经，并签订了竞赛合同。在竞赛一周内，全市制砖厂的大部分大窑赶上和超过了这个车间的水平。
    长春市司炉工人的节煤竞赛自始至终与技术革新运动紧密结合，互相促进。为了寻找更多的节煤途径，工人们大力进行设备改造和操作方法的革新。长春市石绵厂把过去在炉膛内烧煤改为外砌炉膛烧煤，使锅炉蒸汽量增加一倍，每天可省煤15％。同时在炉膛内增设水冷壁，使锅炉受热面积达到100％，使炉口温度由一千零三十度提高到一千零七十度。长春市保温材料厂根据过去全厂倒陷窑效率低、耗煤量大的情况，把全厂的倒陷窑全部改为高温隧道窑，同时安装管道，充分回收余热，加以利用，全厂的耗煤量比改革前降低了86.34％。（附图片）
