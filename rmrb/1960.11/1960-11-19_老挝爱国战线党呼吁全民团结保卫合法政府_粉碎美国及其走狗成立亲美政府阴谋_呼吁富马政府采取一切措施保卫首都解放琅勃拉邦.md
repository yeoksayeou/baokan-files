Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th -- According to a broadcast today by the Lao Fighting Forces Radio, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a letter to the entire nation on November 17th, calling on all the people to unite closely and smash the conspiracy of US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique to overthrow the Phouma government.

The letter to the nation pointed out that Laos is facing an unprecedentedly serious threat. US imperialism is once again concentrating its forces and intensifying its intervention in Laos, supporting the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique. Recently, it even instigated the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique to use their running dogs - some reactionary military officers - to stage a rebellion in Luang Prabang, using force to trample on the King's authority and forcing and coercing the King to obey their will. Obviously, US imperialism and its running dogs are stepping up their efforts to realize their conspiracy to overthrow the legitimate Phouma government and establish a pro-American puppet government. Their aim is to turn Laos into a military base and colony of US imperialism.

The letter to the nation said, "All ethnic groups, political parties, religions, cities and villages, regardless of men, women, old or young, must unite more widely and closely around the 'Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unified Country' to form a strong force."

The letter to the nation called on officers and soldiers of the Royal Army, cadres and fighters of the People's Armed Forces, and all Lao patriots "to unite as one, resolutely smash all the conspiracies of US imperialism and the traitorous clique, to save our country, defend the legitimate government, rescue the King from the encirclement and kidnapping of the traitorous clique, and enable the independence of the country, national harmony and the policy of peaceful neutrality to be realized."

The letter to the nation also said, "We call on the government to take all resolute measures to defend the capital Vientiane and liberate Luang Prabang. We call on the government to resolutely demand that US imperialism immediately stop using dollars and weapons to help the traitorous clique. We call on the government to resolutely implement a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality, accept unconditional assistance from all countries, in order to get rid of the state of being bound by the United States."

    老挝爱国战线党呼吁全民团结保卫合法政府
    粉碎美国及其走狗成立亲美政府阴谋
    呼吁富马政府采取一切措施保卫首都解放琅勃拉邦
    新华社河内18日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会11月17日发表告全民书，号召全体人民紧密团结，粉碎美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团推翻富马政府的阴谋。
    告全民书指出，老挝正在受到空前严重的威胁。美帝国主义再次集中力量，变本加厉地干涉老挝，支持富米·诺萨万叛国集团。最近它竟唆使富米·诺萨万叛国集团利用它们的走狗——一些反动军官，在琅勃拉邦市举行叛乱，用武力蹂躏了国王的权力，强迫、要挟国王服从它们的意旨。显然，美帝国主义及其走狗正在加紧实现推翻富马合法政府，成立亲美的傀儡政府的阴谋。它们的目的是把老挝变成美帝国主义的军事基地和殖民地。
    告全民书说，“所有各族人民、各政党、宗教、城市和乡村，无论男女老少，必须更加广泛和紧密地团结在‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’的周围，结成坚强的力量。”
    告全民书号召王国军队的军官和士兵、人民武装力量的干部和战士和老挝一切爱国者“要团结一致，坚决粉碎美帝国主义和叛国集团的一切阴谋，来挽救我们的国家，保卫合法政府，把国王从叛国集团的包围和劫持下解救出来，使国家的独立、民族和睦和和平中立政策获得实现”。
    告全民书还说，“我们呼吁政府要采取一切坚决措施保卫首都万象和解放琅勃拉邦，我们呼吁政府要坚决要求美帝国主义立即停止用美元和武器帮助叛国集团，我们呼吁政府要坚决实现真正的和平中立政策，接受所有国家的无条件援助，以摆脱受到美国束缚的状态。”
