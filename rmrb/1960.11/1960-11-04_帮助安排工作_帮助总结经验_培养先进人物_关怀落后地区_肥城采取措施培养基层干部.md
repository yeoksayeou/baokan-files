Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 3rd. How to strengthen the leadership and training of cadres on the front line of agricultural production so that they can adapt to the needs of running agriculture on a large scale? The Feicheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has gained some experience. Over the past two years, the county has adopted various methods to train a large number of cadres who are closely linked to the masses and familiar with production knowledge, and they have become a strong grassroots leadership force on the agricultural front.

After the communization in 1958, the Feicheng County Committee of the CPC regarded the training of front-line cadres as an important task of the Party and formulated a plan for training cadres. In the spring of this year, it was decided to promote the "three guarantees" (guarantee production, guarantee business, guarantee cadre training) system at each level, that is, the county party committee guarantees the commune party committee secretary, the commune party committee guarantees the brigade branch secretary and the brigade leader, and so on, guaranteeing level by level, layer by layer, and specifically to individuals. County and commune leading cadres regularly assess the policy thinking, theoretical culture, and production knowledge of grassroots cadres, so as to know them well and be aware of the situation, and then provide specific assistance according to the specific situation. Wang Yaoting, secretary of the County Party Committee Secretariat, found that some cadres of communes and production teams had rich production experience but were not good at formulating production plans, so he specifically helped them analyze the situation and helped them formulate practical production plans from all aspects. Li Maolin, secretary of the Taoyuan Commune Party Committee, found that some commune and team cadres lacked the ability of operation and management, so he immediately set up small economic accounting training classes in the production teams and personally helped the brigade party branch secretaries learn the knowledge of operation and management.

Regularly absorbing advanced commune and team cadres to participate in the enlarged meetings of the county party committee is an important method for Feicheng County to train grassroots leading cadres. Every time the county party committee holds an enlarged meeting, it absorbs key commune and team cadres to participate, including commune heads, production brigade leaders, small team branch secretaries, small team leaders, and labor models; there are advanced units and backward units. The leading cadres of the county party committee hold discussions with them at the meeting on policy issues, discuss major production plans together, carry out policy and ideological education to them, help them correctly understand the Party's guidelines and intentions, and improve their political consciousness. Because they go deep into reality and have close ties with the masses and rich production experience, they are also the best consultants to the county party committee.

Going deep into reality to conduct investigation and research and helping the lower levels to summarize and promote experience is another important method for the county to train cadres. The Feicheng County Committee often sends working groups to conduct investigation and research in depth, specifically helping commune and team cadres to summarize experience, so as to continuously improve the working ability and ideological level of grassroots cadres. This year, the county has successively organized nine large-scale working groups with seven hundred people participating, going deep into fourteen communes and two hundred and fifteen production teams to conduct investigation and research, helping grassroots cadres solve some important problems in their work, and summarizing many successful experiences. Cadres generally reflected that this practice was the most practical and useful for them, and the improvement was also the fastest.

The county and commune party committees also prominently used the method of grasping both ends to train and improve cadres. One end is to focus on cultivating advanced model cadres, planting red flags in a big way, setting up pacesetters, and carrying out appraisals and competitions. In the work of widely establishing pacesetters, the county and commune party committees adopted the methods of "selection," "training," and "management." "Selection" is to select those who have good backgrounds, clear histories, upright styles, and outstanding achievements in their work from the masses in various tasks; "Training" is to help these advanced figures summarize experience, vigorously publicize their exemplary deeds, and establish prestige among the masses; "Management" is to care for and cherish them politically, educate them to learn from the masses with humility, prevent complacency, and forge ahead bravely. The other end is to strengthen the training of cadres in backward units. The county party committee sends strong leading cadres to work in backward areas, specifically helping the cadres there analyze the reasons for backwardness, tap favorable factors, summarize experience, and establish cadres' confidence. As a result, forty of the original forty-four third-category teams in the county have risen to the first and second categories.

The county and commune party committees have also created conditions for cadres to study in all aspects, and have held various spare-time red and expert schools and short-term training courses in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, art, tractors, water conservancy projects, etc. These schools and training courses mostly take the production site as the base, combining production and study, so that the teaching content is closely related to reality. Most of the more than 300 Party schools in the county also take classes to the countryside and conduct mobile teaching, so that grassroots cadres also have the opportunity to study in their busy schedules. At present, among the more than 5,100 production brigade leaders and above in the county, about half have been upgraded from the past junior primary school education level to above senior primary school or junior high school education level, and many have become both red and expert local experts.

Due to the county party committee's planned strengthening of training and practical work exercises, a large number of grassroots leading cadres have become outstanding leading backbones. The grassroots leading backbones in the county have not only greatly improved in quality, but also increased in quantity by nearly three times compared with the early days of the people's commune.

    肥城采取措施培养基层干部
    新华社济南3日电　怎样加强对农业生产第一线干部的领导和培养，使他们能够适应大办农业的需要？中共山东肥城县委取得了一些经验。这个县两年来采取各种方法，培养出了大批密切联系群众、熟悉生产知识的干部，已经成为农业战线上一支坚强的基层领导力量。
    中共肥城县委在1958年公社化后，就把培养第一线干部作为党的重要任务，订出了培养干部的规划。今年春季，又决定逐级推行“三包”（包生产，包业务，包培训干部）制度，即是县委包公社党委书记，公社党委包大队支部书记、大队长，这样逐级包、层层包、具体包到人。县、社的领导干部对基层干部的政策思想、理论文化、生产知识等情况经常进行排队，作到知名知情，然后根据具体情况给以具体帮助。县委书记处书记汪耀庭发现公社、生产队有的干部有丰富的生产经验，但不善于制订生产计划，便具体帮助他们分析情况，从各方面帮助他们订出切合实际的生产计划。桃园公社党委书记李茂林发现有的社、队干部缺乏经营管理的能力，便立即在各生产队办起小型的经济核算训练班，亲自帮助大队党支书学习经营管理的知识。
    经常吸收先进社、队干部参加县委扩大会议，是肥城县培养基层领导干部的一个重要方法。县委每次举行扩大会议，都要吸收重点社、队干部参加，其中有社长、生产大队长、小队支部书记、小队长和劳动模范；有先进单位的，也有后进单位的。县委领导干部在会上和他们共同座谈政策性问题，共商生产大计，向他们进行政策思想教育，帮助他们正确领会党的方针意图，提高他们的政治觉悟。由于他们最深入实际，与群众有密切联系，生产经验丰富，因此又是县委最好的参谋。
    深入实际调查研究，帮助下面总结推广经验，是这个县培养干部的另一个重要方法。肥城县委经常派工作组深入一点进行调查研究，具体帮助社、队干部总结经验，来不断地提高基层干部的工作能力和思想水平。今年全县先后组织了九次有七百人参加的大型工作组，深入到十四个公社、二百一十五个生产队进行调查研究，帮助基层干部解决了工作中一些重要的问题，总结出许多成功的经验。干部普遍反映，这种做法对他们的帮助最实际、最有用，提高也最快。
    县、社党委还突出地运用抓两头的方法来培养提高干部。一头是抓培养先进模范干部，大插红旗、广树标兵，开展评比竞赛。在广树标兵工作中，县、社党委采取了“选”、“培”、“管”的办法，“选”是在各项工作中将那些成分好、历史清楚、作风正派、工作有突出成绩的人，从群众中选拔上来；
  “培”是帮助这些先进人物总结经验、大力宣传他们的模范事迹，在群众中树立威信；“管”是从政治上关心、爱护他们，教育他们虚心向群众学习，防止骄傲自满，勇往直前。一头是加强对落后单位的干部的培养。县委抽派强有力的领导干部下放到后进地区，具体帮助那里的干部分析落后原因，发掘有利因素，总结经验，树立干部信心。这样作的结果，全县原来的四十四个三类队已有四十个上升为一、二类队。
    县、社党委还从各方面为干部学习创造条件，举办了各种农、林、牧、艺、拖拉机、水利工程等业余红专学校和短期训练班，这些学校和训练班大都采取以生产场所为基地，边生产边学习，使教学内容密切联系实际。全县三百多处党校，也大都带课下乡，流动授课，使基层干部在百忙中也有学习的机会。目前全县五千一百多名生产大队长以上的干部，约有一半已由过去初小文化程度上升为高小以上或初中文化程度，有不少人还成为又红又专的土专家。
    由于县委有计划地加强培养和实际工作的锻炼，已有大批基层领导干部成为出色的领导骨干。全县基层领导骨干不但在质量上有了极大提高，而且在数量上比人民公社初期增加了近三倍。
