Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 15th: Recently, a large number of new industrial enterprises in Poland have been completed and put into production. Due to the concentrated use of investment, a total of 720 large and medium-sized industrial projects have been completed and put into production this year.

    The Lenin Iron and Steel Works in Poland has undergone a large-scale expansion this year, and recently completed the No. 9 open-hearth furnace and a steel pipe workshop. Funds used to expand this integrated enterprise reached 740 million zlotys. The Warsaw Quality Steel Plant, currently under construction, recently completed two more electric furnaces. The Skawina Aluminum Plant completed the second phase of construction five months ahead of schedule at the end of October, taking only two years, which gave new impetus to the development of Poland's non-ferrous metals industry. This aluminum plant can produce 2,500 tons of aluminum over its planned target this year.

    A series of newly built chemical industry projects have recently been completed, including the Kędzierzyn phthalic anhydride plant and the Toruń superphosphate plant. The famous Oświęcim Chemical Combine has built a number of satellite factories, bringing the total number of factories included in the Oświęcim Chemical Combine to 50. The sulfur ore dressing plant in the Tarnobrzeg sulfur mining area has also been put into production.

    Across the country, a number of new turbines in thermal and hydroelectric power stations have recently begun generating electricity.

    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 14th: Romania is currently building and renovating many chemical enterprises, and this year the chemical industry's production will increase tenfold compared to 1938.

    The Borzești Petrochemical Combine is one of the large-scale chemical enterprises that Romania began building last year. The combine's soda ash manufacturing plant was put into production in August of this year. Another large petrochemical combine has begun construction in Craiova. Fertilizer plants are under construction in Roznov and Făgăraș, and the annual fertilizer production of these two plants will total 310,000 tons. A soda ash plant with an annual output of 150,000 tons is under construction in Govora.

    During the Six-Year Plan period (1960-1965), the average annual growth rate of Romania's chemical industry will increase from 17.5% during the 1956-1960 period to 22.5%. Although Romania's chemical industry only truly began to develop after liberation, its chemical industry production will reach the production level of France and West Germany in 1957-1958 by 1965.

    During the Six-Year Plan period, Romania will build 22 chemical combines and chemical factories; add 21 workshops to existing chemical enterprises, and add 28 sets of equipment. These newly built enterprises and workshops will be mechanized and automated, and labor productivity will be more than doubled compared to existing similar enterprises or workshops, while costs will be reduced by 25%. By 1965, Romania's fertilizer production will reach 2 million tons, an increase of 8.6 times compared to 1959, the output of plastics and synthetic resins will increase thirteenfold, and the output of synthetic yarn will increase 42 times compared to 1959.

    波兰罗马尼亚建成一批新企业
    波兰今年建成并投入生产的大、中型工业项目达七百二十项
    罗马尼亚化学工业迅速发展今年产量将比1938年增长十倍
    新华社华沙15日电　最近以来，波兰又有一大批新的工业企业建成并投入生产。由于集中使用投资，今年建成并投入生产的大中型工业项目共有七百二十项。
    波兰列宁冶金联合企业今年进行了大规模的扩建，最近已建成了九号平炉和一座钢管车间。用于扩建这个联合企业的资金达到七亿四千万兹罗提。正在建设中的华沙优质钢厂最近又建成了两座电炉。斯卡维纳制铝厂在10月底提前五个月、以两年的时间完成了第二阶段建设工程，使波兰的有色金属工业得到了新的发展。这个铝厂今年可超计划生产二千五百吨铝。
    一系列新建的化学工业项目最近已经完工，其中有肯杰仁的磷苯二甲酸厂，托伦的过磷酸钙厂等。著名的奥斯威辛化学联合企业又建成了一些卫星厂，这样，奥斯威辛化学联合企业所包括的工厂已达到五十个。塔尔诺布热格硫磺矿区的硫磺选矿厂也已投入生产。
    全国各地还有一批热电站和水电站的新涡轮机最近开始发电。
    新华社布加勒斯特14日电　罗马尼亚目前正在兴建和改建许多化学企业，今年化学工业的生产将比1938年增长十倍。
    博尔泽斯蒂石油化学联合企业是罗马尼亚从去年开始修建的大型化学企业之一，这个企业的纯碱制造厂已在今年8月份投入生产。另一个大型石油化学联合企业已开始在克拉约发兴建。在罗兹诺夫和弗各拉什都在建设化肥厂，这两个厂的化肥年产量将共达三十一万吨。一座年产十五万吨产品的制碱厂正在果沃拉兴建。
    在六年计划期间（1960—1965），罗马尼亚化学工业平均每年的增长速度将由1956—1960年期间的17.5％提高到22.5％。虽然罗马尼亚的化学工业在解放后才开始真正兴办，但是它的化学工业的生产到1965年就将达到法国和西德在1957—1958年的生产水平。
    在六年计划期间，罗马尼亚将兴建二十二座化学联合企业和化学工厂；在现有化学企业中增建二十一个车间，还将增加二十八套设备。这些新建的企业和车间都将是机械化和自动化的，劳动生产率将比现有同类企业或车间提高一倍多，而成本却降低25％。到1965年，罗马尼亚的化肥产量将达到二百万吨，即比1959年增长八点六倍，塑料和合成树脂产量将增长十三倍，合成纱产量将比1959年增长四十二倍。（附图片）
