    Tian Ma Poem

    News report: On October 27th, while U.S. Vice President Nixon was campaigning for the next presidential election in Michigan, he was "welcomed" by eggs and tomatoes thrown at him. … Tomatoes and eggs, with whom I have a feud, I go there, and they follow. They are good things in themselves, with great nutritional value, but for me, Nixon, they are not to my taste. That year touring South America, I will always remember it, the hosts were too "enthusiastic," the gifts too "generous"! Shouting slogans while throwing them hard: Tomatoes and eggs, rolling embroidered balls all over the sky! Tomatoes were smashed, egg yolk flowed all over, the hosts' "enthusiasm" was high, and they even said the gifts were not enough! … Since then, I've lost my appetite, I shudder at the sight of them! Who knew this would happen at home too! I implore my fellow countrymen, I dare not accept such generous gifts! (Attached picture)

    报载：美国副总统尼克松十月二十七日在密执安州作竞选下届总统旅行的时候，受到了迎面而来的鸡蛋和番茄的“欢迎”。……番茄和鸡蛋，与我结冤仇，我到那里去，它跟那里走。本是好东西，营养大大有，对我尼克松，却不合胃口。那年游南美，永远记心头，主人太“殷勤”，赠礼太“丰厚”！一面呼口号，一面狠狠投：番茄和鸡蛋，满天滚绣球！番茄被撞破，蛋汁满身流，主人“热情”高，还说礼不够！……自从那以后，我就败胃口，见了它们俩，心里就发抖！那知在国内，也来这一手！恳告众同胞，厚礼不敢收！（附图片）
