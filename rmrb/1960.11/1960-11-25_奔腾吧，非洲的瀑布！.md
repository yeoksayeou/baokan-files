    Roar, African Waterfalls!
    Liu Feng

    Africa, a fascinating continent! Among its magnificent natural landscapes, the majestic and diverse waterfalls are particularly eye-catching.

    Here, at the western border junction of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, on the Zambezi River, the waterfall cascades down from a height of over one hundred meters, spanning one thousand seven to eight hundred meters in width. It surges and roars, its sound carrying far and wide, the water mist is pervasive, and rainbows frequently appear, often leaving travelers in awe. The local people aptly call this waterfall "Mosi-oa-Tunya," meaning the smoke that thunders. Later, the colonialists disgracefully added the name of the British Queen Victoria to it, calling it Victoria Falls.

    Waterfalls of this size are not uncommon in Africa. The Congo River, the Nile River, and the Orange River all have them, and there are even more smaller waterfalls. There are a total of seventy-two waterfalls on the Zambezi River, and there are also many waterfalls on the Congo River.

    Why are African waterfalls so large and numerous?

    To have large waterfalls, you must have a large volume of water. "Mosi-oa-Tunya" pours out an average of 3.56 million liters of water per second. If it were to pour like this continuously, it would only take a few hours to drain the filled Ming Tombs Reservoir. The water volume of the Congo River is even greater than that of the Zambezi River, second only to the Amazon River in South America in the world. Why is the water volume so large? This is due to the heavy rainfall. Of course, many places in Africa are very arid, but the area near the equator in central Africa has particularly heavy rainfall, and many famous rivers originate here, with the Congo River traversing this region.

    With abundant water volume, there must also be drastic changes in the terrain's elevation, causing the water flow to suddenly drop, and this will create many huge waterfalls. The characteristic of African terrain, generally speaking, is that it is a plateau continent. There are some lowlands along the coast, and some basins are scattered in the plateau. Africa, in the historical development process of the earth, is a relatively stable and hard ancient land. Here, the earth's crust rarely undergoes drastic and complex bending and folding into mountains, and it slowly rises or sinks, sometimes producing faults. In areas where the continent approaches the coast, there are often elevated highlands, forming a barrier between the interior of the continent and the coastal lowlands. When rivers cut through the highlands and turn to lower ground, they naturally drop sharply, forming waterfalls; when the rocks in the area through which the river flows are soft and hard, the softer ones are destroyed and lowered by the flowing water, and the harder ones are preserved relatively higher, which is also where waterfalls appear; sometimes, due to the partial collapse of the earth's crust, the terrain drops sharply, also forming waterfalls.

    So many huge waterfalls are an infinite source of power. Large water volume and fast water flow can create a large hydraulic force, and the place where the terrain suddenly becomes lower to form a waterfall has an especially fast water flow. Therefore, waterfalls are an important water resource.

    Africa's hydropower resources are extraordinarily abundant. Many people have made different estimates. Some estimate that these hydropower resources account for more than one-fifth of the world's hydropower resources. If all of them were used for power generation, it would save billions of tons of coal each year. The electricity that can be generated by "Mosi-oa-Tunya" alone can meet the needs of a large area south of equatorial Africa. However, under imperialist rule, the waterfalls—these pearls of the African people—have also become dim. According to statistics in 1954, only eight ten-thousandths of Africa's hydropower resources were utilized.

    The waterfalls are roaring, time is advancing, and the power of the people is as turbulent and unstoppable as the waterfalls. The imperialist colonial rule in Africa is disintegrating. The African waterfalls will surely wash away the humiliation imposed by the imperialists, and with the force of a thunderbolt, carve out a happy tomorrow for the African continent.

    奔腾吧，非洲的瀑布！
    柳风
    非洲，令人神往的大陆；在她的壮丽的自然景色中，雄伟多采的瀑布特别引人注目。
    这是南、北罗得西亚西部边界连接处，在三比西河上，瀑布从一百多米的高处倾泻下来，宽达一千七、八百米，奔腾澎湃，声震远近，水雾迷漫，彩虹时现，常使旅行者叹为观止。当地人民恰如其分地将这个瀑布叫做“毛西奥东亚”，意思是声似雷鸣的雨雾。后来被殖民主义者给它屈辱地加上了英国女王维多利亚的名字，称为维多利亚大瀑布。
    像这样大的瀑布在非洲并不少见，刚果河、尼罗河、橘河上都有，较小的瀑布更多，在三比西河上共有瀑布达七十二道，刚果河上的瀑布也很多。
    非洲的瀑布为什么既大且多呢？
    瀑布大，必须水量大，“毛西奥东亚”平均每秒要倾泻三百五十六万升流水，照这样倾泻下去，用不了几小时就可把灌满了水的十三陵水库流干。刚果河的水量比三比西河的水量还要大，在世界上仅次于南美洲的亚马孙河。为什么水量大？这是由于雨多。当然，非洲有不少地方是很干旱的，但是非洲中部赤道附近一带，雨却特别多，著名的大河多发源于此，刚果河更横贯这个地区。
    有了丰富的水量，还得地形高低起伏骤变，使水流突然跌落，这才会出现众多巨大的瀑布。非洲地形的特点，总的说来这是块高原大陆，在沿海略有些低地，高原中则散布着一些盆地。非洲在地球的历史发展过程中是块比较稳定的坚硬的古陆，在这里地壳很少发生剧烈的复杂的弯曲而皱起成山，而且缓慢地隆起或下陷，有时产生了断裂，在大陆迫近沿海一带常有隆起的高地，形成大陆内部与沿海低地间的障壁。当河流切割高地转入低处时，自然要急转直下，形成瀑布；河流流经地区岩石有软有硬，软者被流水破坏变低，硬者保存相对变高，也是瀑布出现的地方；有时由于地壳部分陷落，地势陡降，也形成瀑布。
    如此众多巨大的瀑布，是无穷的动力。水量大和水流快才能使水力大，而地势突然变低形成瀑布的地方，水流特快，因此瀑布是重要的水力资源。
    非洲的水力资源是异常丰富的，许多人作了不同的估计，有的人估计这些水力资源约占世界水力资源的五分之一以上，如果全部用来发电，每年要节省数十亿吨煤炭。仅“毛西奥东亚”所能发出的电力，就可供赤道非洲以南大片地区的需要。但是在帝国主义统治之下，瀑布——这些非洲人民的珍珠，也变得暗淡无光，据1954年统计，非洲水力资源仅有万分之八被利用。
    瀑布在奔腾，时间在前进，人民的力量正像瀑布一样汹涌澎湃，势不可当。帝国主义在非洲的殖民统治正在瓦解，非洲的瀑布一定能冲掉帝国主义者所施加的屈辱，而以雷霆万钧之力，为非洲大陆冲出幸福的明天。
