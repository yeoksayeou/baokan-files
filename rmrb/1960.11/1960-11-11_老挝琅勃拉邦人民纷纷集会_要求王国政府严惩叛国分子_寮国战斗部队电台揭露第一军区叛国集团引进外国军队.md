Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th - The Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces broadcast today: Nearly one thousand residents of Phonteou locality, Luang Prabang Province, Laos, held rallies on November 5th in three areas and respectively passed proposals to Prime Minister Phouma of the Lao Royal Government. These proposals opposed Phoumi Nosavan and Khamphan Panya, etc., for luring some officers in Luang Prabang, betraying the motherland, betraying the people, and betraying the Royal Government; demanded the cessation of all treasonous plots in Luang Prabang; and appealed to the Phouma government to severely punish the officers who were determined to betray the nation.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th - According to a broadcast today by the Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces, the people of fifty-six villages in Phonteou County, Pakse Province, Laos, held a rally on November 2nd, protesting against the conspiracy of certain officers in the First Military Region to use Luang Prabang Province as a base for treasonous activities and forcing young people to enlist in the army to attack the Lao Fighting Forces.

The broadcast said that 1,300 residents of Baphi and Muang Phun in Phongsaly Province also held rallies, severely condemning the Phongsaly provincial traitorous group for carrying out "sweeps" and looting against the people, and opposing the forced conscription of young people to fight in the civil war.

According to another broadcast by the Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces today, the commander of the unit designated "C.V. 147," acting on the orders of the U.S. imperialists and the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, commanded his troops at the end of October to carry out "sweeps" in the Muang Bo and Na Vi areas of Phongsaly Province, plundering the local people's cattle, livestock, grain, cloth, etc. Twenty-five soldiers who participated in the "sweep," witnessing the people being cruelly plundered, were unwilling to collude with the traitorous group and have surrendered to the people's side.

Another unit designated "I.B." robbed the people of horses and cattle in the Jiang Nu area during a "sweep" and burned down a village.

The broadcast said that the above-mentioned crimes have aroused unparalleled anger among the local people. Residents of more than ten townships in Phongsaly Province have fled into the forests and are fighting against the "sweeps" together with the people's armed forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th - In a broadcast today, the Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces revealed that the First Military Region traitorous group had illegally introduced foreign troops into Lao territory, seriously undermining national sovereignty.

The radio said that the People's Armed Forces obtained at the end of October a secret order No. 623-LH dated October 19, 1960, signed by the commander of the First Military Region. This order, issued to the commanders stationed in the Nale District, Bung Neua Township, Muang Khoua County, Oudomxay (County), Oudom Neua (County) and Liwei (Township) of Phongsaly Province, ordered them to receive the "Eighth Commando Volunteer Army" sent by a foreign country.

The radio pointed out that the above-mentioned order revealed that half of these foreign troops had already arrived at the military region headquarters and would be sent to various companies. The other half of the foreign troops would be airdropped on October 25 to the following garrisons: thirty-five men to each company stationed in Nale; thirty-five men to each company stationed in Bung Neua; twenty-five men to each company stationed in Muang Khoua County; fifteen men to each company stationed in Oudomxay and Oudom Neua; thirty men to each company stationed in Phongsaly County and Phaya Songxouf Township.

The radio pointed out that the order also specifically instructed local commanders to absolutely prevent anyone from telling the people that "there are foreign troops in our unit."

The Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces emphasized that the above-mentioned actions fully proved that the rebel group in the First Military Region, especially the reactionary group in Phongsaly, had secretly colluded with foreign invading forces and were cooperating with these invading forces to conduct "sweeps" in Phongsaly Province.

The radio pointed out that the actions of the First Military Region traitorous group seriously violated the national laws and the Phouma government's policy of peace and neutrality, national harmony, and a unified country, and at the same time, seriously undermined the peaceful life of the people.

The radio concluded by saying that, regarding the above-mentioned actions of the traitorous group, the people of Phongsaly Province and the people throughout the country who love their country and love peace demand that the Phouma government take measures to stop them and punish those officers who collude with foreign invading groups.

    寮国战斗部队电台揭露第一军区叛国集团引进外国军队
    新华社河内10日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：琅勃拉邦省丰通地方居民近一千人，11月5日在三个地区举行集会，分别通过了给老挝王国政府富马首相的建议书。这些建议书反对富米·诺萨万和坎番·班雅等拉拢琅勃拉邦的一些军官，背叛祖国、背叛人民和王国政府；要求制止一切叛国分子在琅勃拉邦的阴谋行动；呼吁富马政府严惩死心塌地背叛民族的军官。
    据新华社河内8日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝巴色省丰通县五十六个村的人民11月2日举行集会，抗议第一军区某些军官阴谋利用琅勃拉邦省作为进行叛国勾当的基地以及强迫青年当兵，进攻寮国战斗部队。
    广播说，丰沙里省巴非、芒奔等地居民一千三百人也举行集会，严厉谴责丰沙里省叛国集团对人民进行“扫荡”和劫掠的行为，反对强迫青年打内战。
    据寮国战斗部队电台在今天的另一项广播中揭露，番号为“C·V·一四七”的部队的指挥官，接受美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的命令，在10月底指挥部队在丰沙里省芒波、那维一带进行“扫荡”，掠夺当地人民的耕牛、家畜、粮食、布匹等。参加“扫荡”的二十五个士兵目睹人民惨遭洗劫，不愿同叛国集团同流合污，已向人民方面投诚。
    另一个番号叫“I·B·”的单位在进行“扫荡”时，在江怒地方抢走人民的马匹、耕牛，并烧毁了一个村的房子。
    广播说，上述罪行引起了当地人民的无比愤怒，丰沙里省十多个乡的居民已经跑进森林里，并和人民武装力量一起进行反“扫荡”的斗争。
    新华社河内9日电　寮国战斗部队电台在今天广播的消息中揭露了第一军区叛国集团曾非法把外国军队引进老挝境内，严重地破坏了国家主权的罪行。
    电台说，人民武装力量在今年10月底曾获得一份第一军区指挥官签署的1960年10月19日第六二三——ＬＨ号密令。这项发给驻在丰沙里省的那勒区、崩能乡、芒科县、乌代（县）、乌怒（县）和里威（乡）等地区指挥官的密令，命令他们接收外国派来的
  “第八号突击队志愿军”。
    电台指出，上述密令透露：这批外国军队的半数已经到达军区指挥部，他们将被派到各个连队。其他一半外国军队将于10月25日分别空降到以下驻地：驻在那勒的每一个连队有三十五人；驻在崩能的每一个连队有三十五人；驻在芒科县的每一个连队有二十五人；驻在乌代和乌怒的每一个连队有十五人；驻在丰沙里县和发雅松夫乡的每一个连队有三十人。
    电台指出，这项密令还特别指示各地指挥官绝对制止任何人告诉人民说“我们部队里有外国军队”。
    寮国战斗部队电台强调指出，上述行为充分证明了第一军区的叛乱集团，特别是丰沙里的反动集团已经同外国侵略军队秘密勾结，并同这些侵略军队配合，在丰沙里省进行“扫荡”。
    电台指出，第一军区叛国集团的行动，严重地违反了国家法律和富马政府的和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的政策，同时，严重地破坏了人民的安宁生活。
    电台最后说，对于叛国集团的上述行动，丰沙里省人民和全国爱祖国、爱和平的人民要求富马政府采取措施予以制止，并惩治那些同外国侵略集团勾结的军官。
