Xinhua News Agency, 8th of November: The more than 7,800 cadres from central government agencies who were sent to work in rural areas in the spring of 1960 have achieved great gains in ideological remolding and strengthening the construction of people's communes after nearly a year of labor training.

This year is the third year that cadres across the country have implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of sending cadres to lower levels for labor training. Actual circumstances have proven that this policy has achieved tremendous success in cultivating and improving cadres and strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, and has therefore been embraced by the vast number of cadres and the masses. More than 80% of the cadres sent down by central government agencies at the beginning of this year were sent to rural people's communes, distributed across 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions throughout the country. Among these cadres, in addition to more than 600 leading cadres at the division (bureau), section, and subsection levels, the majority were young cadres from intellectual backgrounds. During their nearly one year of working at lower levels, they resolutely implemented the training policy of "taking physical labor as the primary task and ideological remolding as the guiding principle," actively and enthusiastically participating in major agricultural labor, and joining the vast number of commune members in waging heroic and tenacious struggles against severe natural disasters. Many cadres sent to lower levels also participated in agricultural technical transformation activities and consolidated and improved various grassroots tasks of the people's communes. In these activities of production practice and social practice, the vast majority of cadres were able to persist in eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, thereby making considerable progress in strengthening their class viewpoint, labor viewpoint, and mass viewpoint, and in remolding their world outlook of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology."

Before being sent to lower levels, some cadres believed that after the rural people's communes were established, there was no need to analyze problems from a class viewpoint, believing that class struggle no longer existed. After arriving in the countryside this time, they personally experienced that the process of consolidating and developing the people's communes was always permeated with the struggle between two roads and two lines, believing that this was a good place to train their class stance. A young Communist Party member from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who had gone from kindergarten to elementary school, middle school, and university, and then studied abroad, before entering a scientific research institution after returning to China, concluded during this labor training in the countryside: "I deeply feel that the countryside is a good place for intellectuals to train, a good place for Party spirit training, and a base for me to take root." In the past, many people acknowledged the glory and greatness of labor in theory and in words, but in reality, they had varying degrees of ideas that looked down on physical labor and the working people. Some people recalled that in the past, they yearned for the countryside to admire "bean trellises and melon racks, small bridges and flowing water," or "red flowers and green willows, white snow and red plums." Now their feelings have changed. Everyone is often concerned about the impact of wind, clouds, rain, and dew on agricultural production. They hope for rain during drought and hope for sunshine during excessive rain. When they encounter rain after a long drought, they are happy even if their clothes get wet. A female cadre from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs felt extremely dirty when she stepped on cow dung when she first arrived in the countryside and hurried back to wash it. Later, she gradually realized that manure is a treasure for crops. When planting corn, she was responsible for applying manure. At this time, she deeply felt: "Without the stench of manure, where would there be the fragrance of rice?" Liu Jianbang, a cadre from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who was sent to lower levels, actively participated in a series of farm work from planting to harvesting. He worked more than 140 workdays in half a year. After being rated as a Red Flag member, he summarized his thoughts and said: "Now, I have truly experienced the sweetness and bitterness of labor and the difficulty of creating material wealth, and I have realized that the working people are truly respectable." He said that he now feels that physical labor has become a part of his life needs. If he does not work for a slightly longer period of time, he feels uncomfortable as if something is missing. Because the cadres sent to lower levels persisted in implementing the "Four Togethers," they established a close relationship with the masses like family members. When the cadres from the Ministry of Coal Industry who were sent to a small team in the Changxing People's Commune in Beizhen County, Liaoning, were transferred away from the team, the commune members held a meeting overnight, requesting that the cadres sent to lower levels remain in their team.

While the cadres sent to lower levels reaped a bumper harvest in ideological remolding, they made considerable contributions to the construction of rural people's communes and to vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. First of all, in the struggle against natural disasters, they carried forward the revolutionary spirit of heroism, tenacity, and hard work, and were praised and loved by the vast number of commune members. The cadres from the Central Broadcasting Administration who were sent to the Jianming People's Commune in Zunhua County, Hebei, carried water together with the commune members to overcome drought during the spring, crossing mountains and ridges to rush to plant crops. Many intellectual cadres who in the past "could not carry burdens on their shoulders" still worked even with swollen shoulders. In small teams where labor was scarce, the cadres sent to lower levels undertook all the wheat watering tasks, completing the five-day task in three days. Some cadres helped the production team install water pumps and diverted water to the mountains, ensuring that the hillside fields were planted on time. The masses praised them, saying: "The cadres sent to lower levels have held up half the sky in the fight against drought." The cadres from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications who were sent to Changsha County, Hunan, persisted in working alongside the commune members before and after the "double rush" (rush harvesting and rush planting), and in six cold waves and one gale of level nine, they worked early and returned late, and did not stop until the task was completed, receiving praise from Party committees at all levels and from the masses. When a cold wave struck, the cadres from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who were sent to Yiyang County, Hunan, resolutely responded to the Party committee's call to "protect seedlings as if protecting lives," and were not afraid of wind, rain, darkness, or slippery roads, and covered seedlings and smoked them with the commune members late into the night. Some cadres even took their own raincoats and bed sheets to cover the seedlings. This action greatly inspired the masses.

The cadres sent to various places also actively participated in the agricultural technical transformation movement under the leadership and encouragement of the Party committees. Some of the cadres sent down by the Ministry of Agriculture helped the people's communes repair and install boiler-powered machines and water pumps, surveyed canals, and assisted in the establishment of small hydropower stations; some helped commune members summarize their experience in high wheat yields. Engineering and technical cadres from the First Ministry of Machine Building who were sent to Tonggu County, Jiangxi, worked with the workers of the county's agricultural machinery factory to make and improve more than a dozen types of agricultural machinery, such as potato slicers, threshers, and wheat seeders. They also helped manufacture small generators and small iron smelting furnaces, and repaired and manufactured three simple machine tools, which greatly promoted the technical innovation movement in this remote mountainous area, changing the factory's original situation of relying almost entirely on manual labor.

Many cadres sent to lower levels have been wholeheartedly loved by the commune members for helping production teams run public canteens well and carrying out amateur political and cultural education activities. After cadres from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications were sent to some production teams in the Fulong People's Commune in Changsha County, Hunan, out of the twenty-three canteens there, seven were first-class and sixteen were third-class. After the commune Party committee mobilized the cadres sent to lower levels to participate in the management of the canteens, the number of first-class canteens quickly increased to seventeen, and the remaining six were also upgraded to second-class canteens. The commune members praised the cadres sent to lower levels. A cadre group from the First Ministry of Machine Building who were sent to the Xinan Zhuang team of the Chengan People's Commune in Cixian County, Hebei, sent the deputy group leader, Qin Rongguo, to be the canteen manager with the support of the Party branch and at the request of the commune members. The whole group acted as advisors, rectified the canteen management, improved the processing of rice and flour and the canteen vegetable garden, and made local tap water and vegetable cutting machines. The food was well-prepared. The commune members said: "Old Qin runs the canteen, the steamed buns are big, the rice is thick, there is dry and thin food, the food is good and saves grain. It would be great if the cadres sent to lower levels could stay in our village for a longer time."

    干部下放劳动政策成就辉煌
    中央国家机关今年下放干部坚持“四同”发扬革命传统
    思想改造获得丰收，为建设农村人民公社作出不少贡献
    新华社8日讯　中央国家机关1960年春天下放到农村的七千八百多名干部，经过将近一年的劳动锻炼，在思想改造和加强人民公社建设方面，取得了很大的收获。
    今年是全国干部执行党中央关于下放干部劳动锻炼政策的第三年，实际情况证明，这个政策在培养提高干部、加强党同群众的联系等方面，获得了巨大的成功，因而得到了广大干部和群众的拥护。中央国家机关各单位在今年年初下放的干部，80％以上下放到农村人民公社，他们分布在全国二十六个省、市、自治区。这批干部，除六百多名司（局）、处、科级领导干部外，其余大部分是知识分子出身的青年干部。他们在下放近一年的时间里，坚决执行了“以体力劳动为主、以思想改造为纲”的锻炼方针，积极热情地参加了农业主要劳动，和广大社员一起，向严重的自然灾害进行了英勇顽强的斗争，许多下放干部还参加了农业技术改造活动和巩固提高人民公社的各项基层工作。在这些生产实践和社会实践的活动中，绝大多数干部都能坚持和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，因而使他们在加强阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点方面，在“兴无灭资”的世界观的改造方面，都有了长足的进步。
    在下放之前，有些干部认为农村人民公社化以后，就不需要用阶级观点分析问题了，认为阶级斗争已经不存在了，这次到了农村以后，亲身体会到人民公社在巩固、发展的过程中，始终贯穿着两条道路和两条路线的斗争，认为这是锻炼阶级立场的好场所。中国科学院一个从幼儿园到小学、中学、大学，然后出国留学，回国后就进入了科学研究机关的青年共产党员，这次在农村参加劳动锻炼中，得出结论说：“我深深感到，农村是知识分子锻炼的好地方，是党性锻炼的好场所，是自己生根落脚的据点。”许多人过去在理论上和口头上承认劳动光荣、伟大，实际上却程度不同的存在着轻视体力劳动、轻视劳动人民的思想。有的人回忆说，过去向往农村，是为了欣赏“豆棚瓜架，小桥流水”，或“花红柳绿，白雪红梅”。而现在他们的感情起变化了，大家经常关心的是风云雨露对农业生产的影响，天旱盼雨，多雨盼晴，久旱遇雨，淋湿了衣服也欢欢喜喜。外交部一位女干部刚到农村时，踏了一脚牛粪，觉得脏得不得了，赶紧回去刷洗，后来逐渐体会到粪是庄稼宝，点种玉米时她负责施粪，这时她深深地感到：“没有粪臭，哪有米香？”中国科学院下放干部刘建邦，在积极参加了从种到收一系列的农活，半年作了一百四十多个劳动日，被评为红旗队员以后，总结思想说：现在，我确实体会到了劳动的甘苦，创造物质财富之不易，认识到劳动人民是真正令人尊敬的。他说，他现在感到体力劳动已成为生活需要的一部分，稍长时间不劳动，就像缺了什么似的不舒服。由于下放干部坚持实行“四同”，他们同群众建立了亲如家人的关系。煤炭工业部下放到辽宁北镇县长兴人民公社一个小队的干部，当被调动离开这个小队时，社员们连夜开会，要求下放干部留在他们小队。
    下放干部在思想改造获得丰收的同时，为建设农村人民公社，为大办农业、大办粮食，作出了不少贡献。首先是在向自然灾害作斗争中，他们发扬了英勇顽强和艰苦奋斗的革命精神，受到了广大社员的赞扬和爱戴。中央广播事业局下放到河北遵化县建明人民公社的干部，在春季抗旱运动中，和这个公社社员一起，翻山越岭，担水抢种，许多过去“肩不能担担”的知识分子干部，压肿了肩膀照样干。在劳动力较缺的小队里，下放干部承担了全部小麦浇灌任务，五天任务三天完成。有的干部帮助生产队安装了抽水机，引水上山，保证了山坡田按时下种，群众赞扬说：“下放干部顶住了抗旱半边天”。邮电部下放到湖南长沙县的干部，在双抢前后，在六次寒潮和一次九级大风中，始终和社员一道坚持劳动，做到了早出工、晚收工、不完成任务不收兵，受到了各级党委的表扬和群众的称赞。中国科学院下放到湖南益阳县的干部，当寒潮袭来时，坚决响应党委提出的“保苗如保命”的号召，不怕风雨、天黑、路滑，和社员一道深夜复盖秧苗、熏烟，有的干部把自己的雨衣、被单也拿来盖在秧苗上，这种行动大大地激励了群众。
    下放到各地的干部，还在党委的领导和鼓励下，积极参加了农业技术改造运动。农业部的下放干部，有的帮助人民公社修理安装了锅驼机、抽水机，勘测了渠道，协助建立了小型水电站；有的帮助公社社员总结了小麦丰产经验。第一机械工业部下放到江西铜鼓县的工程技术干部，和这个县农业机械厂的职工一起制成和改进了切薯机、打谷机、小麦播种机等十多种农业机械，还帮助制造了小型发电机、小型炼铁炉，修理和制造了三台简易机床，使这个工厂改变了原来几乎全部靠手工操作的状况，大大促进了这个偏僻山区的技术革新运动。
    许多下放干部由于帮助生产队办好了公共食堂，开展了业余政治、文化教育活动，得到了社员的衷心爱戴。邮电部干部下放到湖南长沙县福临人民公社一部分生产队，那里二十三个食堂，一类的七个，三类的十六个，公社党委动员下放干部参加管理食堂以后，一类食堂很快增加到十七个，下余六个也升为二类食堂，社员们对下放干部交口称赞。第一机械工业部下放到河北磁县成安人民公社西南庄小队的一个干部小组，在党支部支持和社员要求下，派副组长秦荣国当食堂管理员，全组作参谋，整顿了食堂管理工作，改进了米面加工和食堂菜园，制成了土自来水和切菜机，伙食办得很好，社员们说：“老秦办食堂，馍大饭稠，有干有稀，吃得又好又省粮，下放干部多在俺村呆些时候就好了。”
