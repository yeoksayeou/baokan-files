    Arrange Labor with Grain as the Key Link; Manage with the Team as the Base and Four Sectors Operating
    Bancheng Commune Develops Diversified Economy to Support Agriculture
    This Year's Income from Diversified Economy Exceeds One Million Yuan, an Increase of Eighty Percent Compared with the Same Period Last Year
    (Our dispatch) The Bancheng Commune in Qinglong County, Hebei Province, has achieved a total income of 1.4 million yuan from diversified economy this year (net income of 840,000 yuan), an increase of 88.7% compared with the same period last year. The development of diversified economy has strongly supported agricultural production. The funds drawn from diversified economy this year were used to purchase a large number of power machinery and new-style agricultural tools, which played an important role in this year's agricultural production increase.
    Bancheng Commune is located in the deep mountains, with dense forests, a wide variety of wild animals and plants, and abundant resources. In order to promote the development of grain production, the Commune Party Committee decided to make full use of these favorable conditions to develop diversified economy. The commune, from top to bottom, established a strong leadership front.

    Cleverly Arrange Labor, Rationally Deploy the Battlefield
    Agricultural production is highly seasonal, and some diversified economic productions are also highly seasonal. According to the situation of Bancheng Commune, the beginning of spring plowing is the peak season for digging medicinal materials; during the tense summer hoeing stage, a large number of mountain apricots should be collected; the busy autumn harvest coincides with the harvest season of more than ten kinds of wild plants such as wild grapes, wild dates, mushrooms, and acorns. Therefore, rationally and scientifically arranging and using labor force, and making full use of all available time, is an important link to ensure the overall development with grain as the key link.
    Bancheng Commune divides the whole agricultural production process into three periods: busy, medium busy, and less busy. Busy: three stages of spring plowing, summer hoeing, and three autumn harvests. During this stage, 80% of the labor force must be guaranteed to be invested in the front line of field production. In order not to delay the opportunity to collect all the highly seasonal "treasures", diversified economic production adopts the method of "giving way without dismounting and seizing every opportunity" to carry out a blitz. Medium busy: between spring plowing preparation and the end of spring plowing, between the end of summer hoeing and autumn harvest, and the final stage of the three autumn harvests. In this stage, agricultural work is slightly eased, and the labor force participating in diversified economy accounts for 10%-15% of the total labor force. Temporary operation groups are formed mainly by production teams, and the role of auxiliary labor is fully utilized to carry out blitz. The focus of operation is mainly on cutting strips, harvesting mountain grass, collecting firewood, and collecting small oilseeds, etc., to prepare raw materials for weaving and solve the problems of livestock feed, regulating people's lives, and winter heating. Less busy: the three winter months (November, December, and January). The labor force engaged in diversified economy accounts for 30%-40% of the total labor force, or even more. Operation groups are organized in small teams to carry out a mass "search for treasures" movement. In short, the development of diversified economy in this commune, under the premise of ensuring agriculture, has adopted the twenty-character measures of "work hard when less busy, work less hard when medium busy, do incidental work when busy, seize every opportunity, and squeeze time for blitz". In this way, both the completion of agricultural production tasks and the development of diversified economy are guaranteed.

    Divide the Scope of Operation and Rationally Distribute Income
    This commune, based on the principles of unified operation, classified management, and taking into account both the collective and the individual, and according to the principles of being conducive to the development of production, and facilitating the unified leadership of the commune and mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties, determined to take the brigade (basic accounting unit) as the main operation, and implemented "three-level management" (commune, brigade, team) and "four-sector operation" (brigade, team, canteen, individual). All those that require a lot of people, have large incomes, and are highly technical are contracted to the team by the brigade for unified operation; all those that are small-scale and seasonal, require a lot of labor but have popular production technology, are divided into each team for operation; all those that do not occupy collective labor time, are not convenient for collective action, and are suitable for sporadic picking are allowed to be operated by individuals; the production of non-staple foods such as chickens, ducks, pigs, and vegetables are managed by the canteen as household production (members can also engage in it).

    After clarifying the scope of operation, rationally distributing income, implementing distribution according to work, and implementing more pay for more work are important guarantees for mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties and accelerating the development of diversified economy. This brigade adopted the method of "allocating tasks according to labor and rationally sharing profits" to the team, and the team implemented "fixed quota production and over-quota rewards" to the members. The distribution ratio is handled in the spirit of the brigade getting more, and the team and individuals getting less. In this way, the brigade's income is guaranteed and wages can be issued in a timely manner; the team also has a certain amount of public accumulation, which is convenient for purchasing some small production tools; and the income of individual members is also increased.
    In the development of diversified economic production, Bancheng Commune has always followed the spirit of "combining immediate interests with long-term interests, and combining the development of mountainous areas with the construction of mountainous areas". In 1959, it formulated a plan for the comprehensive development and construction of mountainous areas. It stipulates that the exploitation of mountain products should be combined with harvesting and cultivation; cattle and sheep should be raised in grassland areas; ducks should be raised in places with many rivers; silkworms and bees should be raised in places with lush flowers and plants; and medicines should be planted in places with a foundation for planting medicines. In the past year or so, the commune's diversified economy has developed greatly. Each household has an average of 3.5 pigs; each person has an average of one head of large livestock, one sheep, two chickens, twenty fruit trees, and two hundred mulberry trees.

    以粮为纲安排劳力　以队为主四家经营
    板城公社发展多种经营支援农业
    今年多种经营收入一百多万元，比去年同期增长十分之八
    本报讯　河北青龙县板城公社，今年多种经营的总收入已达一百四十万元（纯收入为八十四万元），比去年同时期增长88.7％。多种经济的发展，有力地支援了农业生产。今年从多种经营收入中抽出的资金，购回大批动力机械和新式农具，对今年农业增产起了重要作用。
    板城公社地处深山，森林茂密，野生动植物种类繁多，资源丰富。公社党委为了促进粮食生产的发展，决定充分利用这一有利条件，发展多种经济。公社从上到下，建立了坚强的领导战线。
    劳力巧安排合理布战局
    农业生产季节性很强，多种经营生产有的季节性也很强。根据板城公社情况，春耕开始，正是大挖药材盛期；紧张的夏锄阶段，大批的山杏应该采集；繁忙的秋收正和山葡萄、山枣、蘑菇、橡籽等十多种野生植物的收获季节相遇。因此，合理地、科学地安排、使用劳动力，充分利用一切可以利用的时间，是保证以粮为纲全面发展的一个重要环节。
    板城公社在整个农业生产过程中，把全年划分为：大忙、中忙、小忙三个时期。大忙：春耕、夏锄、三秋生产三个阶段。在这阶段必须保证80％的劳动力，投入田间生产第一线。为了不悞时机的把一切季节性强的“百宝”收回来，多种经济生产采取“让路不下马和见缝插针”的办法突击。中忙：春耕准备、春耕结束到夏锄之间、夏锄完了到秋收之间和三秋扫尾阶段。这阶段，农活稍为缓和，参加多种经营的劳力占总劳力的10％—15％，以生产小队为主，组成临时作业组，并充分发挥辅助劳力的作用，开展突击。经营重点，主要是割条子、打山草、打烧柴、采集小油料等，为编织准备原料和解决牲畜饲料、调剂人民生活和过冬取暖等问题。小忙：冬三月（十一、十二、一月），搞多种经营的劳力占总劳力的30％—40％，或更多一些，以小队为单位组织作业组，开展群众性的“索取百宝”运动。总之，这个社多种经营的开展，在保证农业的前提下，采取了“小忙大干，中忙小干，大忙附带，见缝插针，挤空突击”二十个字的措施。这样，既保证了农业生产任务的完成，也保证了多种经营的发展。
    划分经营范围　合理分配收益
    这个公社根据统一经营，分级管理，集体和个人兼顾的原则，根据既有利于发展生产，又便于公社统一领导和调动各方面积极性的原则，确定以大队（基本核算单位）经营为主，实行了“三级管理”（公社、大队、小队）、“四家经营”（大队、小队、食堂、个人）。凡是用人多、收入大、技术性较强的，都由大队统一包给小队经营；凡是小型的、季节性的，用工虽多但生产技术普及的，分别划给各小队经营；凡不占用集体劳动时间，不便于集体行动，宜于零星采摘的，允许个人经营；鸡、鸭、猪、蔬菜等副食品生产归食堂经营，作为家底生产（社员也可搞）。
    明确了经营范围后，合理分配收益，贯彻按劳分配，执行多劳多得，是调动各方面积极性，加速发展多种经济的重要保证。这个大队采取了向小队“按劳力分配任务、合理分成”，小队向社员实行“定额生产、超额奖励”的办法。分配比例本着大队要多，小队和个人要少的精神来处理。这样，大队收入有保证，能及时发出工资；小队也有一定的公共积累，便于购置一些小型生产用具；社员个人也增加了收入。
    板城公社在开展多种经济生产中一贯遵循“眼前利益与长远利益相结合，开发山区与建设山区相结合”的精神，在1959年就制订了全面开发山区和建设山区的规划。规定对山货开采实行采伐与抚育相结合的办法；在草原地带发展养牛、羊；河川多的地方养鸭；花草旺的地方养蚕、蜂；有种药基础的地方种药。一年多来，全社多种经营大发展，每户平均有猪三点五口；每人平均有大牲畜一头、羊一只、鸡二只、果树二十棵、桑树二百株。
