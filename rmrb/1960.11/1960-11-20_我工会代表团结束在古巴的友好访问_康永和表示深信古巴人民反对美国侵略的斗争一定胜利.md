　　Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 17th. The Chinese Trade Union Delegation, headed by Kang Yonghe, concluded its friendly visit to Cuba and departed for home today.

　　Among those seeing the delegation off at the airport were Odon Alvarez de la Campa, Secretary for Foreign Relations of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, other staff members of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, the wife of Cuban National Bank President Guevara, and other leaders of the Cuban Women's Federation.

　　The delegation arrived here in mid-October at the invitation of the Cuban Workers' Confederation. They attended the International Trade Union Committee for Support of Algerian Workers and People. They visited various parts of Cuba, including factories, repair shops, refineries, stations, banks, agricultural cooperatives, and the school city in the Sierra Maestra, and received a warm welcome from Cuban workers, trade union leaders, and the broad masses of the people. The Chinese guests participated in approximately twenty workers' gatherings, large and small, where workers expressed their determination to thwart American aggression and blockade. Li Shuying, a female member of the delegation, visited the Cuban Women's Federation and was invited to attend a special meeting of the Women's Federation. She was warmly welcomed by Cuban sisters everywhere.

　　During their stay in Cuba, the delegation was also received by Cuban Prime Minister Castro. They presented souvenirs to the Prime Minister.

　　On the evening of the 16th, the Cuban Bank Employees' Trade Union Federation held a farewell banquet for the Chinese representatives. Odon, Secretary for Foreign Relations of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, said that under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, holding high the banners of the General Line, the People's Communes, and the Great Leap Forward, are victoriously marching towards their great goals. He said that Cuban workers thank the Chinese workers and people for their support of the Cuban people. When Odon announced that Chinese rice had arrived in Havana, a storm of applause erupted in the hall. He pointed out that the arrival of the rice demonstrated that the Cuban people are not isolated in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, and they have the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the people of the world. Odon said that the United States occupies China's territory of Taiwan, just as they occupy Cuba's Guantanamo. He emphasized, however, that "the Chinese people will liberate Taiwan, just as Cuba will recover Guantanamo."

　　Kang Yonghe highly praised the efforts of Cuban workers to increase production, practice thrift, and overcome difficulties in order to break the U.S. embargo. He said that the Chinese representatives witnessed firsthand the deep friendship of the Cuban people towards the Chinese people. What deeply impressed the Chinese representatives was the high morale of the Cuban people in resisting American aggression, and the fact that the Cuban people are both taking up arms to defend their motherland and enthusiastically engaging in economic construction. Kang Yonghe expressed his belief that under the leadership of the revolutionary government headed by Castro, the Cuban people, who have already won the victory of the national democratic revolution, will once again triumph in the struggle against American aggression and blockade.

　　Jesus Soto, Organizing Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, emphasized the importance of the solidarity between the two peoples, saying that in any difficult situation, the Cuban working class will always stand with the Chinese working class in the common struggle against U.S. imperialism. Soto asked the Chinese representatives to convey the friendship and respect of the Cuban workers and people to the Chinese workers and people.

    我工会代表团结束在古巴的友好访问
    康永和表示深信古巴人民反对美国侵略的斗争一定胜利
    新华社哈瓦那17日电　以康永和为首的中国工会代表团结束了在古巴的友好访问，今天动身回国。
    到机场送行的有古巴工人联合会对外关系书记奥东·阿耳瓦雷斯·德拉坎帕，古巴工人联合会的其它工作人员，古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉的夫人和古巴妇女联合会的其它领袖。
    代表团是在10月中旬应古巴工人联合会的邀请来到这里的。他们出席了国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会会议。他们访问了古巴各地，包括工厂、修理厂、炼油厂、车站、银行、农业合作社和马埃斯特腊山的学校城，并受到古巴工人、工会领袖和广大人民群众的热烈欢迎。中国客人们在各地参加了大约二十次工人的大小集会，工人们在会上表示了挫败美国的侵略和封锁的决心。代表团的女团员李淑英访问了古巴妇女联合会，并且应邀出席了妇女联合会的特别会议。她到处受到古巴姐妹们的热烈欢迎。
    代表团在古巴停留期间还受到古巴总理卡斯特罗的接见。他们向总理赠送了纪念品。
    16日晚上，古巴银行职员工会联合会为中国代表们饯行。古巴工人联合会对外关系书记奥东说，中国人民在毛泽东的领导下，高举总路线、人民公社和大跃进的旗帜，胜利地走向他们的伟大的目标。他说，古巴工人感谢中国工人和人民对古巴人民的支持。当奥东宣布中国大米已经运到哈瓦那时，大厅里响起了暴风雨般的掌声。他指出，大米的到达表明，古巴人民在反对美帝国主义的斗争中不是孤立的，他们有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和世界人民的支持。奥东说，美国霸占着中国的领土台湾，就像他们侵占古巴的关塔那摩一样。他强调说，但是，“中国人民将解放台湾，就像古巴将收复关塔那摩一样”。
    康永和盛赞古巴工人为增加生产、厉行节约和克服困难来打破美国的禁运所作的努力。他说，中国代表们亲眼看到，古巴人民对中国人民有着深厚的友谊。使中国代表们获有深刻印象的是古巴人民反对美国侵略的高昂士气，以及古巴人民一方面拿起武器保卫祖国另一方面又热情充沛地从事经济建设的这一事实。康永和表示相信，在以卡斯特罗为首的革命政府的领导下，曾经获得了民族民主革命胜利的古巴人民在反对美国侵略和封锁的斗争中将会再次获胜。
  古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托在强调指出两国人民团结的重要性时说，在任何困难情况下，古巴工人阶级将永远同中国工人阶级站在一起进行反对美帝国主义的共同斗争。索托要求中国代表们向中国工人和人民转达古巴工人和人民的友谊和敬意。
