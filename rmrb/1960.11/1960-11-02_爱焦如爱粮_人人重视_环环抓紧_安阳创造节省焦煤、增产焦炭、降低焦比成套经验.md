According to the Henan Daily, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, in order to promote a substantial increase in steel production, Anyang City, Henan Province, recently summarized a set of experiences in saving fuel and ensuring steel overproduction. After the promotion of this set of experiences in various steel plants in the city, good results have been achieved. The average daily output of pig iron in the city for the first twenty days of October exceeded the plan by 17.44%. Compared with September, the blast furnace utilization coefficient increased by 21.5%, while the total coke ratio decreased by 170 kilograms, the charge coke ratio decreased by 9.9%, and the qualified rate of pig iron increased by 5.6%.

　　Calculate Three Detailed Accounts to Lay
  The Ideological Foundation for Saving Fuel
　　The Anyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to saving coal and coke in the steel overproduction movement. It launched the masses to calculate three detailed accounts for saving fuel and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements centered on "using less coal to produce more coke; using inferior coal to produce good coke; using less coke to produce more iron; using inferior coke to produce good iron." The first account is for increasing steel production. Taking the first ten days of October as an example, due to the decrease in coke ratio by 0.13, the coke saved in the city can increase pig iron production by 8.2%; the second account is for improving quality. About 80% of the sulfur content in pig iron is brought in by coke; the third account is for reducing costs. Coke is an important factor in the cost of pig iron. A decrease in coke ratio of 0.2 can reduce the cost of each ton of iron by about 5%. The above three accounts made the workers and masses realize the close relationship between saving coke and realizing a comprehensive leap forward in high yield, high quality, and low cost in steel, laying an ideological foundation for vigorously promoting combustion technology revolution.

　　Broaden the Source of Coking Coal, Reduce Coking Coal Consumption, and Increase Coke Yield
　　The first problem solved by Anyang City in saving ironmaking fuel was to broaden the source of coking coal, reduce coking coal consumption, and increase coke yield and coke quality. The workers and masses of the coking plant proposed and realized more than 5,600 innovation projects around the above four aspects. While ensuring the outward transfer of coking coal, they not only produced good coke with a single blend of coal, but also used 80% of the blended coal mixed with 20% of coal slime or coke powder to make coke, giving new life to the long-term accumulation of 10,000 tons of coal slime. Fireman Li Shouzhu, using coal slime instead of coking coal to burn small fires, after several tests, was able to increase the furnace temperature by 75 degrees, saving more than 14,000 tons of coking coal for the country throughout the year. Under the condition that the demand for coke greatly increased due to the large overproduction of steel, the plant encountered a contradiction that manual coal washing could not adapt to the increase in coke production, and some people had the idea of ​​increasing production by reducing quality. They advocated "radishes can be quick without washing the mud." The workers and masses criticized this view and put forward the suggestion of "wash the mud quickly when the radishes are quick." They adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to manufacture two combined coal washing machines, realizing the mechanization and continuousization of the four processes of raw coal screening, crushing, lifting, and flushing, increasing work efficiency by six times, and ensuring that raw coal does not enter the furnace without washing. They also changed the circulating water to direct current water, and the water volume increased from three to one to five to one, which reduced the ash content of coke by 4.6%, and the charge coke ratio of the ironmaking unit was correspondingly reduced by 7.7%; the coke strength also increased by 20 kilograms, and the coke powder rate decreased by 33.3%.

　　The second problem solved in saving ironmaking fuel is to vigorously promote comprehensive substitution and broaden the source of fuel. The long-term accumulated coke powder and coke slag are now used by the forging equipment plant's steel workshop to mix a certain proportion of coke powder and lime powder to form coke powder balls, and to make coke slag into bricks as fuel for the furnace, in addition to the coking plant using coke powder to produce high-quality coke. All steel production units in the city have promoted their experience. According to incomplete statistics from seven units, the existing coke powder can now be made into more than 17,000 tons of coke powder balls, which can produce more than 10,000 tons of pig iron. In the mass movement to vigorously promote various combustion and fuel technology revolutions, Sang Peirong, the party secretary of the Third Steel Plant, together with the masses, after 65 days of experimentation and more than 50 improvements, finally successfully used white coal lumps to make iron, and the coal lumps in the furnace accounted for more than 80% of the fuel in the furnace. Sang Peirong's coal lump ironmaking experimental furnace, during the 65-day experimental process, had a utilization coefficient of 1.3 and a pig iron qualification rate of more than 80%.

　　Innovate Loading, Unloading and Crushing Tools to
  Reduce Coke Consumption Before Entering the Furnace
　　In order to save ironmaking fuel, all steel production units in Anyang City have minimized the consumption of coke before it enters the furnace. According to statistics, the coke consumption before entering the furnace in various steel production units in the city was about 30% in the past. In response to this situation, the Anyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized that fuel consumption should first be reduced before entering the furnace. All steel production units have innovated the methods and tools for transportation, loading and unloading, crushing, and storage around this link. In terms of coke crushing, the city has widely promoted flat and pointed hammers, adopting the method of heavy hitting with flat hammers for hard coke and light hitting with pointed hammers for soft coke. The flour mill's ironmaking workshop also changed the flat teeth of the crusher to roller-type wolf teeth, so that the consumption of crushed coke was reduced from 25% to 12%. Many experiences in reducing coke consumption have been compiled into easy-to-remember rhymes. Such as loading - quick loading and slow release, placing each piece steadily; unloading - large pieces are moved by hand, small pieces are picked up and cleaned; transportation - speed should be fast, walking should be smooth; material room management - feet do not step on coke, classify and store. The loss rate of coke before entering the furnace in the city has now generally been reduced from about 30% to about 15%.

　　Reduce the Coke Ratio in the Furnace by Controlling Three Barriers and Six Openings
　　While reducing the coke ratio, the steel production front in Anyang City generally adopted measures such as improving ore grade and increasing coke load; increasing blast furnace air temperature and increasing smelting intensity, and tried every means to reduce the charge coke ratio. All steel production units generally established professional ore roasting teams, which not only eliminated the phenomenon of blast furnaces eating raw materials, but also allowed most blast furnaces to eat ore that had been roasted twice, and the iron content of the ore was above 40%. The flour mill's ironmaking workshop mixed a certain proportion of ore powder, coke powder, and lime powder and sintered it into artificial rich ore, which not only reached an iron content of more than 40%, but also made comprehensive use of ore powder and coke powder. The coke load of the plant has increased from 1.71 to 2. All ironmaking units also tightly grasped the operational essentials of "controlling three barriers" (air temperature, furnace temperature, water source) and "controlling six openings" (iron tap, slag tap, four air inlets). When the blast furnace air temperature increased from 500 degrees to 550 to 600 degrees, the coke ratio relatively decreased by 5%. (Attached picture)
　　
　　The national red flag unit for coal preparation - Fushun Laohutai Mine Coal Preparation Plant, vigorously carries out extracorporal concentrate recovery. They set up six recovery stations at the places where the coal washing water flows out. In the past nine months, they have recovered more than 15,000 tons of concentrate from waste water and coal slime. This is a worker recovering concentrate from coal slime.

    爱焦如爱粮　人人重视　环环抓紧
    安阳创造节省焦煤、增产焦炭、降低焦比成套经验
    据河南日报消息　在增产节约运动中，为了促进钢铁大幅度增产，河南省安阳市最近总结了一套节约燃料，确保钢铁超产的经验。这套经验在全市各钢铁厂推行以后，收到了良好的效果。全市10月前二十天生铁平均日产量超过计划17.44％。与9月相比，高炉利用系数提高21.5％，而全焦比却减少了一百七十公斤，入炉焦比下降9.9％，生铁合格率提高5.6％。
    算三笔细账，打下
  节约燃料的思想基础
    中共安阳市委在钢铁大超产运动中，对节约煤、焦十分重视，曾发动群众通过算节约燃料的三笔细账，大闹以“少用煤，多炼焦；用次煤，炼好焦；少用焦，多炼铁；用次焦，炼好铁”为中心内容的技术革新和技术革命运动。三笔细账的头一笔是增产钢铁账。仅以10月上旬为例，由于焦比下降零点一三，全市节约的焦炭，便可提高生铁产量8.2％；第二笔是提高质量账。生铁所含硫分，80％左右是由焦炭带来的；第三笔是降低成本账。焦炭是构成生铁成本的一个重要因素，焦比降低零点二，现有每吨铁的成本便可降低5％左右。上述三笔账，使职工群众认识到节约焦炭对实现钢铁高产、优质、低成本全面跃进的密切关系，为大搞燃烧技术革命打下了思想基础。
    广辟焦煤来源，降低焦煤消耗，提高出焦率
    安阳市在节约炼铁燃料上所解决的头一个问题，是广开炼焦煤源，降低焦煤消耗，提高出焦率和焦炭质量。炼焦厂职工群众围绕以上四个方面，提出并实现革新项目五千六百多项。在保证焦煤外调的情况下，他们不仅用单一的配煤炼出了好焦，而且用80％的配煤掺和20％的煤泥或焦粉炼焦，使长期积存的一万吨煤泥，获得了新的生命。烧火工人李守志，用煤泥代替焦煤烧小火，经过多次试验，能使炉温增加七十五度，全年可为国家节约焦煤一万四千多吨。在钢铁大超产对焦炭需要量大大增加的情况下，该厂出现了人工洗煤不能适应焦炭增产的矛盾，有人产生了以降低质量的方法来提高产量的念头，他们主张“萝卜快了不洗泥。”职工群众批判了这种观点，提出了“萝卜快了快洗泥”的建议。他们采取土洋结合的方法，制造了两架联合洗煤机，实现了原煤过筛、粉碎、提升、冲洗四道工序的机械化、连续化，提高工效六倍，做到了原煤不洗不入炉。他们还把循环水改为直流水，水量由三比一增加到五比一，使焦炭灰分减少了4.6％，炼铁单位的入炉焦比便相应下降了7.7％；焦炭强度也增加了二十公斤，焦粉率相对减少了33.3％。
    在节约炼铁燃料上解决的第二个问题，是大搞综合代用，广开燃料来源。长期堆积起来的焦粉、焦渣，现在除炼焦厂利用焦粉炼出优质焦炭外，锻压设备厂钢铁车间还用一定比例的焦粉和石灰粉相掺合，打结成焦粉球，并将焦渣打结成砖，作为入炉燃料。全市各钢铁生产单位已经推广了他们的经验，据七个单位的不完全统计，现在存有的焦粉就可打制一万七千多吨焦粉球，能炼一万多吨生铁。在大搞多种燃烧和燃料技术革命的群众运动中，第三钢铁厂党委书记桑培荣与群众一起，经过六十五天的试验和五十多次的改进，终于用白煤块炼铁成功，入炉煤块占入炉燃料的80％以上。桑培荣的煤块炼铁试验炉，在六十五天的试验过程中，利用系数达到一点三，生铁合格率在80％以上。
    革新装卸、破碎工具
  减少入炉前的焦炭消耗
    为节约炼铁燃料，安阳市各个钢铁生产单位都最大限度地减少焦炭入炉前的消耗。据统计，全市各钢铁生产单位，入炉前的焦炭消耗过去在30％左右。针对这一情况，中共安阳市委十分强调把燃料消耗首先减少在入炉之前。各钢铁生产单位都围绕这一环节，革新运输、装卸、破碎、保管的方法和工具。在焦炭破碎方面，全市已普遍推广了平、尖两头锤，采用硬焦平锤重打，软焦尖锤轻打的方法。面粉厂炼铁车间还把破碎机的平齿改为磨辊式狼牙齿，使破碎焦炭的消耗由25％减少到12％。降低焦炭消耗的许多经验，已被编成了易于记忆的口诀。如装车——快装慢放，块块放稳；卸车——大块手搬，小块拾净；运输——速度要快，走路要平；料房管理——脚不踏焦，分类保存。全市焦炭入炉前的损耗率，现在已普遍由30％减少到15％左右。
    把三关卡六口降低
  入炉焦比
    在降低焦比的同时，安阳市钢铁生产战线普遍采取了提高矿石品位，增加焦炭负荷；提高高炉风温，增加冶炼强度等措施，千方百计降低入炉焦比，各钢铁生产单位普遍建立了矿石焙烧专业队，不仅消灭了高炉吃生料现象，而且大部分高炉可以吃到经过两次焙烧的矿石，矿石含铁量都在40％以上。面粉厂炼铁车间用一定比例的矿粉、焦粉和石灰粉相掺合，烧结为人造富矿，不仅含铁量达到40％以上，而且使矿粉、焦粉得到了综合利用。该厂焦炭负荷已由一点七一提高到二。各炼铁单位还紧紧抓住了“把三关”（风温、炉温、水源）“卡六口”（铁口、渣口、四个进风口）的操作要领，高炉风温由五百度提高到五百五十到六百度，焦比便相对下降了5％。（附图片）
