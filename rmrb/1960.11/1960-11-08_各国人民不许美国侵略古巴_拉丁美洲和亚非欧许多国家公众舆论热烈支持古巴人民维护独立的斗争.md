(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Public figures and public opinion from various countries are widely condemning the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Cuba and the planned armed invasion, and are warmly supporting the Cuban people's heroic struggle to resist U.S. aggression and defend national independence and sovereignty.

Former Mexican President and prominent political activist Lázaro Cárdenas issued a statement to the press, condemning the U.S. imperialist bloc for exerting pressure on Cuba and attempting to attack Cuba in order to overthrow the revolutionary government headed by Fidel Castro.

Cárdenas pointed out that "the movement against Cuba is intensifying," and he emphasized that no one should be allowed to "use the just actions of the Cuban revolutionary government as a pretext for attacking Cuba." Cárdenas said that the blind attacks on the Cuban revolutionary government would surprise us if we did not know what kind of political and social revolution the Cuban revolution was, and what sacrifices Cuba had made to consolidate this revolution.

Cárdenas pointed out that only the Cuban people themselves can decide what kind of system they need. He finally emphasized: "In any case, no other country, whether large or small, should be allowed to violate Cuban sovereignty."

The Guatemalan University Students Association recently issued a statement regarding Guatemala's use as a base for invading Cuba, demanding that the government pay attention to the dangers that a belligerent and interventionist attitude towards another Latin American country brings to Guatemala. The statement believes that military bases located on Guatemalan territory will threaten the territorial integrity of all Guatemalans. The statement demanded that the government not allow foreign troops to be stationed within Guatemalan territory.

The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League and the Korean Student Committee issued a statement on the 3rd, resolutely condemning the U.S. imperialists' vicious interference in and aggression against Cuba. The statement said that this behavior of the U.S. imperialists is not only an act of aggression against the Cuban people and youth, but also a criminal act against peace-loving people and youth around the world.

The statement said that Korean youth and students welcome with great joy all the achievements made by the Cuban people and youth under the leadership of the Cuban revolutionary government in the struggle to consolidate and develop the victory of the Cuban revolution, and once again express their firm sympathy and support to the heroic Cuban people and youth. The statement finally expressed its conviction that the Cuban people and youth will resolutely smash any aggressive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and achieve final victory.

The Burmese National United Front issued a statement on the 6th, strongly condemning the aggressive activities carried out by U.S. imperialists against Cuba.

The statement pointed out that while Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro was attending the United Nations General Assembly, some American bandits were sent to Cuba to launch a rebellion; however, the Cuban armed forces and people put down these bandits' conspiracy. The statement also condemned the United States for recently dispatching a large number of American troops to the West Indies region and the U.S. for occupying the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in an attempt to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs.

The Iraqi newspaper "Al-Khabar" published a commentary condemning U.S. imperialism for aggression against Cuba.

The commentary said that the U.S. government's attempt to suppress national movements through armed intervention and to rely on military aggression to overthrow independent governments that enjoy broad popular support shows that the U.S. government is still dreaming of the colonial era.

The commentary said that U.S. troops are moving back and forth along the Caribbean coast, landing at the Guantanamo base in Cuba, and U.S. leaders are recklessly issuing "warnings," all of which are aimed at conspiring to overthrow the current Cuban government and replace it with a government that is subservient to foreigners.

The commentary emphasized that the Castro government represents the will of the Cuban people, which is to strive for freedom, independence, and progress. The U.S. fleet and air force cannot suppress the will of the Cuban people, and the final victory will inevitably be the will of the Cuban people.

The commentary pointed out that the Cuban government is full of confidence in victory because it relies on the people who cannot be defeated by any other force.

The Lebanese Peace Committee recently issued a statement supporting the Cuban people's struggle to defend their motherland and protesting against the conspiracy of U.S. aggressors to undermine Cuban independence and endanger world peace.

The statement pointed out that the already independent Republic of Cuba is facing foreign aggression or subversion by domestic reactionaries, both of which are orchestrated by the United States.

Workers and citizens in Bamako, the capital of the Republic of Mali, held a rally on the 6th under the auspices of the Mali Trade Union Federation to support the Algerian people's struggle for independence and the Cuban people's struggle to defend their independence.

Keita Nama, secretary of the Mali Trade Union Federation, who recently visited Cuba, gave a report to the assembled masses on the international trade union's support for the heroic struggle of Algerian workers and the Cuban people against U.S. imperialism. He said that all indications show that the imperialist conspiracy against Cuba has entered the stage of implementation. Armed forces ready to launch an invasion have already been concentrated in Guatemala. Between the Panama Canal Zone and Guatemala, U.S. planes are flying back and forth frequently, transporting weapons, war materials, and ammunition to the imperialist mercenaries who intend to strangle the Cuban revolution.

He said that world public opinion will never sit idly by in the face of the above-mentioned facts, which clearly prove that the imperialists intend to launch an aggression against Cuba. The people of all Latin American countries, as well as the people of other continents, have expressed their solidarity with the Cuban people in struggle.

Italian youth demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy in Rome on the 3rd to show their support for the Cuban people's struggle and their opposition to the U.S.'s preparations to invade Cuba.

Dozens of young people, mostly students, marched back and forth in front of the U.S. Embassy. They held signs that read: "Hands off Cuba!" "No Fascism in Cuba!" "Yankees Go Home!" "Cuba neither surrenders nor sells out!"

The police forcibly intervened in the demonstration and arrested twenty young people, nine of whom have been imprisoned.

    各国人民不许美国侵略古巴
    拉丁美洲和亚非欧许多国家公众舆论热烈支持古巴人民维护独立的斗争
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：世界各国的公众和舆论纷纷谴责美帝国主义对古巴的侵略和正在策划中的武装进攻，并热烈支持古巴人民反击美国侵略、保卫民族独立主权的英勇斗争。
    墨西哥前总统、著名政治活动家拉萨罗·卡德纳斯对报界发表声明，谴责美国帝国主义集团对古巴施加压力和企图进攻古巴，以便推翻以菲德尔·卡斯特罗为首的革命政府。
    卡德纳斯指出，“反对古巴的运动正在日益加强”，他着重指出，不允许任何人“利用古巴革命政府的正义行动来作为进攻古巴的借口”。卡德纳斯说，对古巴革命政府的盲目攻击会使我们感到惊讶，如果我们不知道古巴的革命是什么样的政治和社会革命，以及古巴为巩固这一革命而作了怎样的牺牲。
    卡德纳斯指出，只有古巴人民自己能决定自己需要什么样的制度。他最后着重指出：“无论如何，不能容许其他国家，不管是大国或小国来侵犯古巴主权。”
    危地马拉大学生协会最近就危地马拉被利用来作为侵略古巴的基地发表声明，要求政府注意对另一个拉丁美洲国家采取好战和干涉主义的态度给危地马拉所带来的危险。声明认为，设在危地马拉领土上的军事基地将会威胁所有危地马拉人的领土完整。声明要求政府不允许外国军队驻在危地马拉国境内。
    朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会和朝鲜学生委员会3日发表声明表示，坚决谴责美帝国主义对古巴的恶毒的干涉和侵略罪行。声明说，美帝国主义的这种行为不仅是反对古巴人民和青年学生的侵略行为，而且是对全世界爱好和平人民和青年学生的犯罪行为。
    声明说，朝鲜青年学生以巨大的喜悦欢迎古巴人民和青年在古巴革命政府的领导下为巩固和发展古巴革命胜利的斗争中取得的一切成就，并向英雄的古巴人民和青年再一次表示坚决的同情和支持。声明最后表示确信，古巴人民和青年必将坚决粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋，获得最后胜利。
    缅甸民族团结阵线6日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义者对古巴进行的侵略活动。
    声明指出，在古巴总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗出席联合国大会会议期间，一些美国匪徒被派到古巴去发动叛乱；但是古巴的武装部队和人民把这些匪徒的阴谋扑灭了。声明还谴责美国最近把大批美国军队派往西印度群岛地区和美国在古巴的关塔那摩湾霸占的海军基地，企图干涉古巴内政。
    伊拉克“消息报”发表评论，谴责美帝国主义对古巴进行侵略。
    评论说，美国政府企图通过武装干涉镇压民族运动，并倚靠军事侵略推翻得到人民广泛支持的独立政府，这表明美国政府仍然在做着殖民时代的日梦。
    评论说，美国军队来往于加勒比海沿岸，在古巴基地关塔那摩登陆，美国的领导人放肆发出“警告”，所有这一切的目的不外是阴谋推翻古巴现政府而代之以屈从外国人的政府。
    评论强调说，卡斯特罗政府代表古巴人民的意志，那就是争取自由、独立、进步。美国的舰队和空军不能压制古巴人民的意志，最后胜利的必然是古巴人民的意志。
    评论指出，古巴政府对胜利满怀信心，因为它倚靠着不会被任何其他力量战败的人民。
    黎巴嫩和平委员会最近发表声明，支持古巴人民保卫祖国的斗争，并抗议美国侵略者破坏古巴独立、危害世界和平的阴谋。
    声明指出，已经取得独立的古巴共和国面临着外国的侵略或国内反动派的颠复，这两者都是美国策划出来的。
    马里共和国首都巴马科的工人和市民6日在马里工会联合会的主持下举行集会，支持阿尔及利亚人民为争取独立而进行的斗争、支持古巴人民为保卫独立而进行的斗争。
    最近访问古巴归来的马里工会联合会书记凯塔·纳马向到会的群众作了关于国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人和古巴人民英勇反对美帝国主义的斗争的报告。他说，一切迹象表明，帝国主义针对古巴的阴谋已进入实行的阶段。在危地马拉已经集中了准备发动侵略的武装部队。在巴拿马运河区和危地马拉之间，美国飞机往返频繁，把武器、战争物资和弹药输送给打算用来扼杀古巴革命的帝国主义雇佣军。
    他说，世界舆论绝不会对上述的种种事实坐视不顾，这些事实显然证明，帝国主义者打算对古巴发动侵略。所有拉丁美洲国家的人民以及其他各洲的人民，都表示声援在斗争中的古巴人民。
    意大利青年3日在罗马美国驻意大利大使馆前游行示威，以示支持古巴人民的斗争，反对美国准备侵略古巴。
    数十名青年，在美国大使馆前面列队来回游行。他们大都是学生。他们举着标语牌，牌上写道：“不准干涉古巴！”“法西斯主义不许回到古巴！”“美国滚回去！”“古巴既不投降也不出卖自己！”
    警察用武力干涉了这次游行，并且逮捕了二十个青年人，其中九人已经被投入监牢中。
