    Seriously Implement the Party's Policies Based on Reality
    Xingfu Brigade Leads Production According to Local Conditions and Time
    Grain Sales This Year Increased by 10.7% Compared to Last Year; The Canteen is Well-Run, and Wages are Paid Monthly

    (Our report) The cadres of the Xingfu Brigade in Shaquan Commune, Hengshan, Hunan, have adhered to the mass line and the Party's policies in all their work, and have rapidly changed the brigade's poverty-stricken situation.

    This year, the Xingfu Brigade's grain sales to the state increased by 10.7% compared to last year. All twenty-five canteens in the brigade are well-run. From January to October this year, wages were paid monthly, and the brigade's Party general branch has become a red banner among rural Party grassroots organizations in the county.

    The key to the success of this brigade's work is adhering to the Party's policies, but also proceeding from reality and acting according to specific times, locations, and conditions. For example, when implementing the Party's policy of "diversifying crops for high yield and increased harvest," last winter the brigade Party general branch, based on the commune Party committee's production plan for 1960, planned to plant all early rice this year. However, this spring, due to repeated cold waves, some seedlings were damaged by frost, and some seedlings rotted, delaying the season and creating a labor shortage. At that time, the commune Party committee demanded that all brigades must re-examine their plans according to local conditions. The Xingfu Brigade Party general branch launched a major discussion among the masses. At that time, there were three ideological situations among cadres and the masses: one was to advocate adjusting the planting plan according to local conditions, rationally arranging the planting plan, striving for multiple plantings and more harvests, and resolutely ensuring the realization of the 1960 grain production leap forward plan; the second was to advocate "go with the flow," planting as much as possible; and the third was to advocate planting all late rice and propose converting some fields to cash crops. The brigade Party general branch conducted serious analysis and research, supported the opinions of the first group, helped improve the views of the second group, and thoroughly criticized the erroneous proposals of the third group. Furthermore, adopting the working method of the mass line, they organized cadres and commune members to conduct field appraisals to determine the planting plan. Of the brigade's 2,570 mu of paddy fields, it was decided to change the 1,500 mu of mountain and rain-fed and cold-soaked fields from the original plan of planting double-season late rice to planting single-season late rice, and to change the varieties originally arranged for planting Hongjiao Early and Nantao No. 1 to planting Zaodongnian. This was practical and implemented the Party's policy of diversifying crops for high yield and increased harvest, so everyone unanimously agreed. As a result, this 1,500 mu of single-season late rice achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest, realizing the grain production leap forward plan. In order to achieve diversified crops and more harvests, the brigade Party general branch also tried every means to expand the cultivated area. This year, they converted more than 80 mu of dry land that had been dry for decades into rice paddies, and planted more than 90 mu of barren open space that had been barren for decades with miscellaneous grain crops. These two items alone increased grain production by more than 60,000 jin.

    Educating Party members, cadres, and commune members to frequently and conscientiously study the Party's policies and resolutely act in accordance with the policies is an important method for the Xingfu Brigade Party general branch to implement the Party's various policies and measures. For the instructions and policies of the higher-level Party committee, the brigade Party general branch always first organizes Party members and cadres to conscientiously study and unify their thinking. After the cadres improved their thinking, they immediately launched a propaganda and education campaign among the masses to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Through propaganda and education, the current production was effectively promoted. After the Provincial People's Committee issued the "Proclamation on Running Rural Public Canteens Well," the brigade Party general branch immediately organized cadres to study and discuss it item by item. At that time, a few cadres did not fully understand the purpose and significance of establishing canteen family affairs and had some concerns, fearing that canteen family affairs production would conflict with large collective production for fertilizer, land, and labor. The brigade Party general branch comprehensively summarized the experience of the Second Canteen of the Shizhang Production Team and the Third Canteen of the Tuzi'ao Team in establishing canteen family affairs, explaining that as long as they acted in accordance with the Party's policies, canteen family affairs production would not only not affect collective production, but also promote the development of collective production. After the cadres' thinking was clarified, they immediately organized commune members to study and discuss it item by item, and in accordance with the spirit of the proclamation of the Provincial People's Committee, comprehensively planned the establishment of canteen small family affairs in the entire brigade and reasonably stipulated the handling methods for various specific problems. Now all the canteens in the brigade are well-run. In implementing various policies, the brigade Party general branch has always paid attention to mobilizing the masses, patiently conducting propaganda and explanation to the masses, and turning the Party's policies into the conscious action of the masses.

    Educating cadres, strengthening the mass viewpoint, going deep into the grassroots, taking the lead in everything, is also an important method for the Xingfu Brigade to comprehensively implement the Party's various policies. Since this year, the seven general branch committee members have been assigned responsibilities, the secretary has been in charge of a area, and the general branch committee members have been in charge of a team. Everyone has gone deep into a team, gone to a work group to focus on key tasks, worked diligently, set an example, and guided the overall situation. During spring plowing and production this year, Wang Leming, secretary of the brigade Party general branch, went deep into the third work group of the Dafa Production Team. In his work, he found that this work group had more than 20 mu of mountain paddy fields, which had previously had very low yields due to mountain floods. He conducted many studies with the cadres and old farmers in the group, and led more than 20 commune members to fight for two days, opening a new small ditch to avoid mountain floods. This year, this piece of land has achieved high yields. The hard-working and in-depth style of the brigade cadres has set an example for the small team cadres, who are all like the brigade cadres, going deep into the masses, going deep into the fields, participating in production, and leading production.

    从实际出发认真执行党的政策
    幸福大队因地因时制宜领导生产
    今年交售粮食比去年增长百分之十点七，食堂办得好，按月发工资
    本报讯　湖南衡山沙泉公社幸福大队干部在各项工作中，坚持群众路线和党的方针政策，迅速改变了本队的贫穷面貌。
    今年，幸福大队交售给国家的粮食比去年增长10.7％，全大队二十五个食堂都办得很好，今年从1月到10月，月月发了工资，大队党总支也成了全县农村党的基层组织的一面红旗。
    这个大队各项工作搞得好的经验，主要是坚持党的方针政策，但又从实际出发，按照具体时间、地点、条件办事。例如贯彻党的“多种高产多收”的方针时，去年冬天大队党总支根据公社党委制订的1960年生产规划，计划今年全部种植早稻。到今年春季，由于多次寒潮的侵袭，冻坏了一些禾苗，烂了一些秧，季节推迟了，劳力也出现了紧张现象。当时公社党委提出要求各大队必须因地制宜，重新考虑计划，幸福大队党总支在群众中开展了一场大讨论。当时在干部与群众中存在有三种思想情况：一种是主张因地制宜，合理安排种植计划，力争多种多收，坚决保证实现1960年粮食生产跃进计划；第二种是主张“就汤下面”，种多少算多少；第三种是主张全部插迟稻，并提出把一部分田改种经济作物。大队党总支进行了认真的分析研究，支持了第一种人的意见，帮助提高第二种人的看法，彻底批判了第三种人的错误主张。并且采取群众路线的工作方法，组织干部与社员，临田鉴定，确定种植计划。全大队二千五百七十亩水田，决定把其中的一千五百亩山冲天水田、冷浸田，由原计划插双季晚稻改为插一季晚稻，把原来安排插红脚早和南特号的品种改为插早冬粘，这样做切合实际，也执行了党的多种高产多收的政策，因此大家一致赞成。结果，这一千五百亩一季晚稻获得了全面大丰收，实现了粮食生产跃进计划。为了实现多种多收，大队党总支还千方百计扩大耕地面积，今年来他们把几十年的旱土八十多亩改为水稻田，把几十年来的荒坪空地九十多亩种上了杂粮作物，光是这两项耕地就增产粮食六万多斤。
    教育党员、干部和社员，经常认真地学习党的方针政策，坚决按政策办事，这是幸福大队党总支贯彻执行党的各项政策措施的一个重要方法。对上级党委的指示、政策，大队党总支总是首先组织党员、干部认真学习，统一思想认识。干部提高思想后，立即在群众中掀起了一个大办农业、大办粮食的宣传教育运动。通过宣传教育，有力地推动了当前生产。省人民委员会颁发了“关于办好农村公共食堂的布告”后，大队党总支就立即组织干部逐条的进行了学习和讨论，当时，少数干部对建立食堂家务的目的和意义认识不足，存在一些顾虑，怕食堂家务生产同大集体生产发生争肥料争土地争劳力的矛盾。大队党总支就全面总结了石樟生产队第二食堂和兔子垇队第三食堂建立食堂家务的经验，说明只要按照党的政策办事，食堂家务生产不但不会影响集体生产，而且还能促进集体生产的发展。干部思想弄通后，立即组织社员群众逐条的进行了学习讨论，并根据省人民委员会的布告精神，对全大队建立食堂小家务全面作了规划，合理地规定了各项具体问题的处理办法。现在全大队的食堂都办得很好。在贯彻各项政策时，大队党总支始终注意发动群众，耐心向群众进行宣传解释，使党的方针政策变为群众的自觉行动。
    教育干部，加强群众观点，艰苦深入，事事带头，也是幸福大队在全面贯彻执行党的各项方针政策中的一项重要方法。今年以来，七个总支委员分工负责，书记包片，总支委员包队，每个人都深入一个队，到一个作业组搞重点，扎实地工作，做出榜样，指导全面。今年春耕生产时，大队党总支书记王乐明深入到大发生产队三作业组，在劳动中他发现这个作业组有二十多亩山冲田，过去由于山洪冲洗，产量很低，他与组里的干部、老农一起进行多次研究，带领二十多个社员，奋战两天，另外新开了一条小港子，避免了山洪冲洗。今年来，这片田获得高产。大队干部的这种艰苦深入作风，给小队干部树立了榜样，都和大队干部一个样，深入群众、深入田间，参加生产，领导生产。
