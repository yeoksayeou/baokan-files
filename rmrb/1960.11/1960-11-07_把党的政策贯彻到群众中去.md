Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts:

    To implement the Party's policies, we must first raise the cadres' awareness of implementing the policies. And this awareness is mainly based on the cadres' profound understanding of the Party's policies. In every revolutionary stage, the Party has stipulated a general line and specific policies. These lines and policies are formulated based on the objective situation of a certain period, the level of awareness of the masses, and the long-term and current interests of the people. For example, from the current system of unified leadership and decentralized management implemented by the people's communes in Hunan Province, the three-level ownership system based on the brigade is suitable for the current needs of productive forces development. At present, it is necessary to earnestly implement the policies of equivalent exchange, distribution according to work, "three guarantees" and rewards, and the combination of work and rest. Because only in this way can we develop production and better mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, creating more wealth for socialist construction.
    To implement the Party's policies, we must also fully follow the mass line, hand over the policies to the masses, mobilize the masses, and work together to implement the policies. Chairman Mao taught us: "Our policies should not only be known to the leaders and cadres, but also to the broad masses."
  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume IV, page 1317) Because if the Party's policies are not handed over to the masses and understood by the masses, the policies are not easy to implement, and the enthusiasm of the masses is difficult to mobilize. It must be recognized that our policies are truth, come from the masses, and return to the masses, and are in line with the long-term and current interests of the broad masses. If we do not hand over the policies to the masses, and do not let everyone know what to do and how to do it, how can everyone be mobilized and how can things be done well?
    The purpose of implementing the Party's policies is to develop production. Therefore, to implement the policies of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production among the masses, we must closely integrate it with the current autumn harvest, winter planting, and other production work. (Summary of "New Hunan Daily" editorial) × × ×
    In the autumn harvest distribution, implementing the principle of deducting less and distributing more, and implementing monthly pre-payment of wages, is an important measure to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, promote production development, and consolidate and improve the development of people's communes.
    To adhere to deducting less and distributing more, we must correctly understand the relationship between production and distribution. In terms of the relationship between production and distribution, under normal conditions, production determines distribution. Only by first doing a good job in production can we talk about doing a good job in distribution and improving the lives of commune members. Under certain conditions, distribution also plays a decisive role in production. In the case of Hebei Province suffering from serious disasters this year, it is a very important task to implement the principle of deducting less and distributing more, adhere to putting politics in command, and do a good job in distribution so that the income of commune members increases. By doing so, the production enthusiasm of commune members will be greatly improved, so that commune members will fully recognize the superiority of the people's communes, further enhance the sense of collectivism, and care more about production.
    The fundamental key to adhering to deducting less and distributing more is to mobilize the masses, hand over the policies to the masses, and mobilize the masses to come up with ways to increase income and save expenses. The Party's distribution policy reflects the actual interests of the masses. When the masses know the distribution policy, they will find many ways to both increase the income of commune members and support production development. Experience has proven that only by earnestly mobilizing the masses can various work tasks be completed. Therefore, in the distribution work, we should adhere to the mass line, adopt the method of combining bottom-up and top-down, and mobilize the masses to discuss repeatedly.
    At present, the "Three Autumns" work is still continuing, and the winter production upsurge is about to begin. All localities should do a good job in distribution according to the spirit of deducting less and distributing more, so as to further mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. (Summary of "Hebei Daily" editorial)
    What do we rely on to formulate advanced production plans and realize advanced production plans? We must rely on the enthusiasm of the masses. What do we rely on to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses? First of all, we must rely on the correct implementation of the Party's policies, that is, the correct handling of the relationship between the three aspects of national interests, collective interests, and individual interests. Contracted production targets and production planning targets are closely related, but they are not the same thing. Contracted production is first of all a policy issue, because it is related to the distribution of the production team and the income of the squad and commune members. With the contracted production targets implemented and the reward and compensation system clarified, as long as the production squad works hard, there will be production to exceed and rewards to be obtained, and naturally there will be enthusiasm for exceeding production.
    Agricultural production is greatly affected by natural conditions, and the natural conditions of different squads and different cultivated lands are quite different. Any technical reform measure is correct and effective only under certain conditions, and is not unconditionally and absolutely good. Through efforts, conditions can be changed, but it takes time and steps, not overnight. It can be implemented after the conditions have changed; it cannot be implemented before the conditions have changed. Therefore, the rational arrangement of crops and area must combine adherence to reform with planting according to local conditions. The living soul of Marxism is a concrete analysis of concrete situations. From the perspective of crop arrangement, it is even more necessary to use this method to specifically analyze the specific situation of the cultivated land of each squad, and arrange it plot by plot. And to achieve the rational arrangement of crops plot by plot, it is fundamentally impossible to do without the production squad and the masses of commune members.
    To implement the "Three Guarantees" policy, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and truly trust the masses in our thinking. Naturally, we can let go in action. How can we truly achieve trust and letting go? The best way is to let them go to the production team and production squad, have a heart-to-heart talk with the squad cadres and commune members in a symposium, adopt the method of letting go and mobilizing the masses, personally do a pilot project, and then compare the opinions of the masses with their own opinions, and compare the two approaches and the two results, and they will suddenly realize.
    Letting go and mobilizing the masses and strengthening the Party's leadership have always been unified. Letting go and mobilizing the masses in the "Three Guarantees" work removes the various subjectivism and commandism "frameworks" that bind the masses, and at the same time liberates the leadership from tedious accounting work, and can correctly strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership. That is to say, leading cadres must earnestly do the following: First, master the Party's policies and production guidelines, and through in-depth publicity and education, make the Party's policies and production guidelines mastered by the masses, and check their implementation; second, lead the representative meetings of the production team well. Every major issue in the "Three Guarantees" work should be democratically discussed and approved by the representative meeting to implement the collective leadership of the production team and fully promote democracy; third, go deep into the production squad to do ideological work, and at the same time help the squad solve specific problems.

### 把党的政策贯彻到群众中去

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    把党的政策贯彻到群众中去
    要贯彻党的政策，必须首先提高干部对于贯彻党的政策的自觉性。而这种自觉性，又主要是建立在干部对党的政策的深刻理解上。党在每一个革命阶段，都规定有总路线和各项具体政策。这些路线和政策，都是根据一定时期的客观情况，群众的觉悟程度，根据人民群众的长远利益和目前利益制定出来的。比如从当前湖南省人民公社所实行的统一领导、分级管理的制度来看，以大队为基础的三级所有制是适合当前生产力发展需要的。在目前，必须认真贯彻执行等价交换、按劳分配、“三包”奖励，以及劳逸结合等政策。因为只有这样做，才有利于发展生产，才能更好地调动广大群众的积极性，为社会主义建设事业创造更多的财富。
    要贯彻执行党的政策，还要充分走群众路线，把政策交给群众，把群众发动起来，一齐动手执行政策。毛主席教导我们：“我们的政策，不光要使领导者知道，干部知道，还要使广大的群众知道。”
  （“毛泽东选集”第四卷一三一七页）因为如果不把党的政策交给群众，为群众所了解，政策是不易贯彻的，群众的积极性也是很难调动起来的。必须认识，我们的政策是真理，是从群众中来又回到群众中去的，是符合广大群众的长远利益和目前利益的。不把政策交给群众，不让大家知道要做的是怎样一回事，应当怎样做法，大家怎么能动起来，事情怎么能办好呢？
    贯彻执行党的政策，目的是为了发展生产。因此，把大办农业、大办粮食的政策贯彻到群众中去，必须密切结合当前的秋收、冬播和其他生产工作。　（新湖南报社论摘要）×　×　×
    在秋收分配中，贯彻执行少扣多分的原则，实行按月预发工资，是当前调动广大社员积极性，促进生产发展，巩固和健全发展人民公社的一项重要措施。
    要坚持少扣多分，必须正确地认识生产和分配的关系。就生产和分配的关系来说，在一般条件下，生产决定分配。只有首先把生产搞好，才能谈到搞好分配，改善社员生活。在一定的条件下，分配对生产也起决定性的作用。在今年河北省受到严重灾害的情况下，贯彻执行少扣多分的原则，坚持政治挂帅，作好分配工作，使社员的收入有所增加，就成为一项十分重要的工作。这样做了，就会大大提高社员的生产积极性，从而使社员充分认识到人民公社的优越性，进一步增强集体观念，更加关心生产。
    坚持少扣多分的根本关键是发动群众，把政策交给群众，发动群众想出增加收入、节约开支的办法。党的分配政策，反映了群众的实际利益，群众知道了分配政策，就会找到既使社员收入增加，又支持生产发展的许多办法。经验证明，只有认真发动群众，才可以完成各项工作任务。因此，在分配工作中，应坚持走群众路线，采用自下而上、自上而下相结合的办法，发动群众反复地讨论。
    目前，三秋工作还在继续进行，冬季生产高潮即将开始。各地应当根据少扣多分的精神，把分配工作做好，进一步调动广大社员的积极性。　（河北日报社论摘要）
    制订先进的生产规划和实现先进的生产规划，靠什么？要靠群众的积极性。调动群众的积极性又靠什么？首先要靠正确地执行党的政策，也就是正确地处理国家利益、集体利益和个人利益三个方面的关系。包产指标和生产规划指标有很密切的关系，但并不是一回事。包产首先是个政策问题，因为它关系到生产队的分配和小队、社员的收入。包产指标落实，奖赔制度明确，生产小队只要自己努力，就有产可超，有奖可得，自然就有超产的积极性。
    农业生产在很大程度上要受自然条件的影响，而不同小队、不同耕地的自然条件，又是千差万别的。任何一项技术改革措施，都要在一定的条件之下才是正确有效的，并不是无条件地、绝对地好。经过努力，条件可以改变，但要有时间和步骤，不是一朝一夕之功。条件改变过来了，可以实行；没有改变过来以前，还是不能实行。因此，合理安排作物和面积，必须把坚持改革和因地种植结合起来。马克思主义的活的灵魂，是对具体情况作具体的分析。从农作物安排来说，更加需要运用这个方法具体地分析每一个小队的耕地的具体情况，逐丘逐块地进行安排。而要做到逐丘逐块地合理安排作物，离开了生产小队和社员群众是根本不可能的。
    贯彻执行“三包”政策，必须相信群众、依靠群众，思想上真正对群众放心，行动上自然就能够放手。怎样真正地做到放心又放手？最好的办法是让他们到生产队和生产小队去，同小队干部和社员群众开个座谈会谈谈心，采取放手发动群众的方法，亲自动手搞一个试点，再把群众的意见和自己的意见比较一下，把两种做法和两种结果比较一下，就会恍然大悟的。
    放手发动群众和加强党的领导，从来是统一的。在“三包”工作中放手发动群众，去掉了束缚群众手脚的各种主观主义和命令主义的“框框”，同时也就把领导上从繁琐的算账工作中解放出来了，能够正确地去加强党的政治思想领导了。这就是，领导干部必须认真做到以下几点：第一，掌握党的政策和生产方针，通过深入的宣传教育，使党的政策和生产方针为群众所掌握，并且检查其执行情况；第二，领导好生产队的代表会议，“三包”工作中的每一个重大问题都经过代表会议民主讨论通过，实行生产队的集体领导和充分发扬民主；第三，深入到生产小队去做思想工作，同时帮助小队解决具体问题。　（湖北日报社论摘要）
