    Persist in Struggle, Transform Nature, Increase Grain Production
    Hong Guanying Youth Work Hard for a Year, Alkali Land Turns into Fertile Land
    (Our Dispatch) Under the leadership of the Party, two hundred young people from the Hong Guanying Brigade of the Laoguanzhai Commune in Linqing City, Shandong Province, worked hard for a year, sowing seeds six times in one go, transforming 1,500 mu of alkali land where not a blade of grass grew. This turned a poor rural area, where "even immortals would struggle to ensure 20% seedling survival," into a prosperous place in a year, shedding its label of poverty.
    The Hong Guanying Brigade has a total of 16,000 mu of land, of which 12,000 mu are alkali land, including 2,000 mu of severe white alkali land where no grass grows and no trees live. Therefore, some people once ridiculed Hong Guanying as a "poor team that will never get back on its feet in a hundred years."
    In March of this year, the brigade's Party General Branch decided to first march on the 1,500 mu of white alkali land where no grass grows. Two hundred young people from the entire brigade accepted this glorious and arduous task. Under the leadership of Hei Yunliang, the secretary of the brigade's Party General Branch, they formed a youth alkali land transformation team and started a battle against nature on the alkali fields.
    The first battle was to irrigate and suppress the alkali. Two hundred young people irrigated the land along a 30-li circular ditch, watching over it in shifts day and night. One night, a section of a branch canal suddenly burst, the water flowing torrentially and widening the breach. Regardless of the water's depth and coldness, the young people jumped into the water, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, forming two "human dikes." The young people above transported soil and grass, finally blocking the breach and allowing the water to flow into each alkali square, carrying the salt content into the alkali drainage ditch. In this way, 1,500 mu of alkali land were thoroughly irrigated, and the first round of the alkali land transformation battle was victoriously concluded.
    The 1,500 mu of alkali land, after being irrigated to suppress the alkali, deeply plowed, and ridged, were leveled, completely changing the original barren appearance of vast white alkali land, high and low. In April, when sowing, the young people worked early and late, seizing the time to sow multi-eared sorghum on this virgin land. Not understanding the technology, they humbly learned from the old farmers. As a result, they completed the sowing task on 1,500 mu of land in just five days.
    Seven days after sowing, the first generation of seedlings emerged from this white alkali land where no crops had ever grown before. However, the seedlings did not live long. By the tenth day, more than half of them had died, and the rest were yellow and thin, on the verge of death. The young people did not lose heart. They said, "Even if this is the first step of the Long March, we must continue to move forward." They then carried out second and third sowings in succession. As a result, after a light rain, the sun shone, and the alkalinity quickly rose to the surface, and the seedlings died in patches. At this critical moment, Zhang Zengli, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, Hei Yunliang, the secretary of the brigade's Party General Branch, and others came to give the young people encouragement in many ways and brainstorm solutions with them. They found that there were the most seedlings next to the ditches and discovered the principle that sufficient water means complete seedlings. Finally, they decided to sow first and then water to suppress the alkali; dig bowl shapes around the seedlings so that even a small rain can accumulate water to suppress the alkali and save the seedlings; dig large nests, bring more original soil, and heavily apply organic fertilizer to transplant the seedlings; and use a combination of manual capture and pesticide to eliminate pests. As a result of the fourth sowing using these measures, although more seedlings emerged than in the previous three times, it was still not a 100% seedling survival rate. By this time, it was too late to sow multi-eared sorghum, so they carried out the fifth and sixth sowings separately, supplementing with soybeans and millet, and then planted vegetables wherever there was space, finally achieving no idle land and full and thriving seedlings. Not long ago, it was still a patch of white alkali land, but now it has put on a green shirt for the first time in history.
    The young people of Hong Guanying worked hard for a year with determination and finally achieved a result, allowing their production team to shed the "poor hat" and catch up with the rich teams. However, they are not satisfied with their existing achievements. They have now taken over more than 500 mu of semi-alkali land from the production team, and have established a pig farm, raising more than 300 pigs. They have also established an alkali transformation technology research group, determined to transform all the alkali land and increase grain production even more. (Attached picture)

    坚持斗争　改造自然　增产粮食
    洪官营青年苦干一年碱地变良田
    本报讯　山东省临清市老官寨公社洪官营大队二百名青年在党的领导下，苦战一年，一鼓作气连续六次播种，改造了一千五百亩寸草不长的碱地，使“神仙来种地，难保二成苗”的穷乡僻壤，一年变富，摘掉了贫困帽子。
    洪官营大队共有一万六千亩土地，而碱地占一万二千亩，其中最严重的有二千亩白碱地，寸草不长，树木不生。因此有人曾讥笑洪官营是“百年也爬不起来的穷棒子队”。
    今年3月，大队党总支决定先向一千五百亩寸草不长的白碱地进军，全队二百名青年接受了这个光荣而艰巨的任务。他们在大队总支书记黑云亮的领导下，成立了青年改造碱地队，在碱场开始了一场向大自然的战斗。
    第一个战役是灌水压碱。二百名青年在长达三十里的循环沟上灌水，昼夜轮班地看守。一个晚上，有一段支渠突然开了口子，水流汹涌，越冲越宽。青年们不顾水深水冷，跳进水里，手挽手，肩并肩，组成两道“人堤”，上边的青年运土、运草，终于堵住了口子，使水流入一畦一畦的碱方里，又带着盐分沉入了排碱沟。就这样，一千五百亩碱地普灌了一遍水，改造碱地战斗的第一个回合胜利结束了。
    一千五百亩碱地，经过灌溉压碱、深翻、整畦，弄得平平整整，彻底改变了原来白碱茫茫、高低不平的荒凉模样。4月，播种时，青年们为了在这块处女地上播种多穗高粱，抢时间，起早贪黑地干。不懂技术，就向老农虚心学，结果仅用五天时间，就完成了一千五百亩土地的播种任务。
    播种后第七天，这块从未长过庄稼的白碱地上生出了第一代幼苗。可是幼苗寿命不长，到第十天就死了一大半，剩下的也又黄又瘦，危在旦夕。青年们没有灰心，他们说：“就算这是万里长征的头一步，我们还要继续往前走。”他们又连续进行了第二次、第三次的播种。结果，小雨一下，太阳一晒，碱性很快反上了地面，小苗还是一片一片地死去。正在这个节骨眼上，公社党委第一书记张增立、大队总支书记黑云亮等都来了，给了青年们多方面的鼓励，并和他们一起想办法。他们发现水渠旁边苗最多，找出了水足苗全的道理。最后确定先播种再浇水压碱；在幼苗周围挖成碗形，下小雨也能积水压碱，保住苗；挖大窝，多带原土，狠上有机肥，进行移苗；采用人工捕和药杀相结合的办法除治害虫。采用这些措施进行第四次播种的结果，出苗虽比前三次多了一大半，但仍然不是十成苗，这时再播种多穗高粱已经太晚了，于是他们又分别进行了第五次、第六次播种，补种上了大豆和黍稷，以后又见缝插针地种上了蔬菜，终于达到了寸土不闲，苗全苗旺。不久前还是一片一片白碱地，现在有史以来第一次穿上了绿衣衫。
    洪官营青年发愤图强，苦干一年，终于干出了一个样子来，使自己所在的生产队摘掉了“穷帽子”，迎头赶上了富队。但他们并不满足于现有成绩，现在又从生产队接管过来五百多亩半碱地，并且建立了养猪场，养了三百多头猪，还成立了改碱技术研究组，决心要把碱地都改造过来，增产更多的粮食。（附图片）
