Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 25th: Shanghai's railway, maritime, and other transportation departments, along with steel production departments and materials supply departments, have established a regular "one-stop joint office" system. This system strengthens the connection and cooperation between steel production and raw material transportation, and between Shanghai and other regions, integrating production and transportation into a responsive and flexibly dispatched whole. Various raw materials are quickly and promptly transported from all directions to the front of the steelmaking furnaces, thereby ensuring a continuous and substantial increase in the city's steel production.

The "one-stop joint office" was established in August of this year by seven relevant departments, including Shanghai Railway, Port Authority, Yangtze River Shipping, Maritime Transportation, Municipal Transportation, Metallurgical Industry, and Materials Supply. Prior to this, these units had already established a collective office (meeting) system every few days to collaboratively resolve raw material dispatch matters. Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement, Shanghai's steel production has increased month by month, requiring raw materials to be transported more, faster, and more timely. The supply and transportation of various raw materials also need to solve more problems regularly. Therefore, relevant units transferred full-time cadres to work together in a centralized location to jointly understand and grasp the transportation situation of raw materials needed for steel production, strengthen connections with other provinces and cities, mines, ironmaking bases, railway stations, and port terminals. At the beginning of the month, they learn about the planned progress of steel production and arrange for the supply and transportation of raw materials as early as possible; in the middle of the month, they understand the task completion of various cooperating units; every day, they learn about the material issuing, transporting, and storage situations in relevant mines and ironmaking bases outside the city, as well as on trains, ships, station terminals, and steel plant warehouses, and solve problems in a timely manner. In this way, the work from mines and ironmaking bases in various places to Shanghai's steel plants has formed a unified whole. Now, whenever raw materials are about to be transported to Shanghai from other places, the joint office notifies relevant departments to prepare in advance. Once the materials arrive, barges, wooden boats, small trains, automobiles, and flatbed trucks are dispatched together to quickly unload and transport the raw materials. At noon on October 15th, the joint office learned that steel plants were going to organize high production and needed more raw materials. They immediately contacted mines and ironmaking bases in various places by telephone. Workers at an ironmaking enterprise in Jiangsu prepared one thousand tons of pig iron at the station in a very short period of time after learning the information. The joint office requested the railway bureau to send vehicles for collaborative transportation. The next day, one thousand tons of pig iron were promptly transported to Shanghai, catching up with the needs of high production.

Shanghai's transportation, metallurgical industry, and materials supply departments also uniformly arrange some basic construction for the transportation routes of steel raw materials within the city, jointly carry out the technical revolution of loading and unloading tools, and actively overcome the weak links in the one-stop transportation line. Since September, they have contributed manpower, materials, and technology, and have built a total of eight new sets of loading and unloading tools and equipment, such as loading and unloading machines, belt conveyors, and coal storage warehouses, at some stations and docks with relatively weak loading and unloading capacities in the city. These new tools and equipment are suitable for loading and unloading trains, ships, automobiles, and other vehicles, which greatly improves transportation capacity. In October, the materials sent to Shanghai for steelmaking from mines and ironmaking bases in various places accounted for 97% of the total shipments within the month, basically achieving no backlog at stations and docks. The transfer time has also been greatly shortened.

### 上海交通、冶金、物资供应部门实行“一条龙联合办公”  加强统一调度　钢厂产量大增

    上海交通、冶金、物资供应部门实行“一条龙联合办公”
    加强统一调度　钢厂产量大增
    新华社上海25日电　上海铁路、海运等交通运输部门和钢铁生产部门、物资供应部门，建立了经常性的“一条龙联合办公”制度。这个制度加强了钢铁生产与原料材料运输之间、上海与外地之间的联系和合作，使生产和运输结合成为一个反应迅速、调度灵活的整体。各种原料材料迅速及时从四面八方运来炼钢炉前，从而保证了全市钢产量连续大幅度上升。
    “一条龙联合办公”是上海铁路、港务、长江航运、海运、市内交通和冶金工业、物资供应等七个有关部门，于今年8月份建立起来的。在此以前，这些单位已经建立了每隔几天一次的集体办公（碰头会议）制度，协作解决原料材料的调度事宜。自从开展增产节约运动以来，上海的钢产量月月提高，要求原料运得更多、更快、更及时，各种原料材料的供应和运输上需要经常解决的问题也更多，因此，有关单位就调出专职干部，集中在一起办公，共同了解和掌握钢铁生产所需原料材料的调运情况，加强和其他的省市、矿山、炼铁基地、铁路车站和港口码头的联系。他们月初了解钢铁生产的计划进度，及早安排原料材料的供应、调运工作；月中了解各协作单位完成任务的情况；每天，了解外地有关的矿山、炼铁基地以及车上、船上、车站码头上、钢铁厂仓库里的发料、运料和存料情况，发现问题，及时解决。这样，就使从各地矿山、炼铁基地直到上海各钢铁厂的工作，形成了一个行动一致的整体。现在，每当原料材料从外地快要运到上海时，联合办公室就早已通知各有关部门做好准备。物资一到，驳船、木船、小火车、汽车、平板车一齐出动，很快就把原料材料卸光运完。10月15日的中午，联合办公室知道各钢铁厂要组织高产，需要更多的原料材料，他们马上用电话和各地矿山、炼铁基地联系。江苏一个炼铁企业的工人知道后，在很短的时间内就准备了一千吨生铁放在车站上。联合办公室就请铁路局派车协运。第二天，一千吨生铁就及时运到上海，赶上了高产的需要。
    上海交通运输、冶金工业和物资供应等部门，还统一安排市内有关钢铁原料材料运输路线的一些基本建设，共同大搞装卸工具的技术革命，积极克服一条龙运输线上的薄弱环节。9月份以来，他们有人出人，有料出料，有技术出技术，在市内一部分装卸能力比较薄弱的车站、码头，总共搞成了装卸机、皮带运输机、储煤仓等八套新的装卸工具和设备。这些新工具和设备既适用于火车、船舶、又适用于汽车和其它车辆的装卸，大大提高了运输能力。10月份，各地矿山和炼铁基地发运给上海炼钢的物资，在月内运到的就占发货总量97％，基本上做到车站码头不积压。调运的时间也大大缩短。
