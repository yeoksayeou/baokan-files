Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 2nd: News: As the Ikeda government intensifies its military expansion in accordance with the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, the Japanese Emperor's reception of high-ranking military officers today is seen as an action by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to expand the Emperor's influence and strengthen militaristic ideology within the Japanese army.
    According to Japanese radio broadcasts, the Emperor received the commanders of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force at the Imperial Palace this afternoon. This is the first time since the war that the Japanese Emperor has received military officers. Before the war, Japanese militarists frequently drove Japanese soldiers to shed blood for their aggressive policies in the name of "loyalty to the Emperor." It is revealed that Emperor Hirohito of Japan openly demanded the three service chiefs to "work hard" to strengthen the Japanese army during the reception today.

    加强军队的军国主义思想
    日本天皇接见三军将领
    据新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本天皇今天接见军队高级将领。在池田政府根据日美军事同盟条约加紧扩军时举行的这次接见，被认为是美日反动派为了扩大天皇的影响，并在日本军队中加强军国主义思想的一个行动。
    据日本电台广播，天皇2日下午在皇宫接见了日本陆、海、空三军的指挥官。日本天皇接见军官，这在日本战后还是第一次。战前，日本军国主义者经常以“效忠天皇”的名义驱使日本军队的士兵为其侵略政策流血。据透露，日本天皇裕仁今天在接见时公然要求三军首脑们“好好地干”，来加强日本军队。
