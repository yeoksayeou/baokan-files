    Let Production Teams Formulate Short-Term Plans Freely
    According to the experiences of various places in the Suzhou Special Zone, the primary key to successfully implementing short-term plans for production teams lies in the correct role of the commune and brigade in leveraging the production team. This means strengthening leadership without excessive interference or rigid prescriptions. This is because the production plans of the commune and brigade are based on the "Three Guarantees" system of the production team, and the team is the unit responsible for guaranteeing production. Allowing the production team to flexibly arrange its short-term plans according to its own circumstances enables it to organize and arrange production in a targeted and practical manner, take measures to strive for overproduction, and achieve greater and better harvests. Since the beginning of the autumn harvest this year, many production teams in the Suzhou Special Zone have organized veteran farmers and technicians to conduct field inspections, based on the principle of harvesting each plot as it ripens. They have formulated short-term autumn harvest plans, determining the order in which each plot of land is to be harvested, arranging manpower, and organizing action. As a result, the harvest has been timely and of good quality, and the phenomenon of incomplete threshing has been greatly reduced.
    The well-formulated short-term plans of the production team, and the active and flexible arrangement of its agricultural tasks, are important conditions for successful production. When harvesting late rice, the 13th Brigade of the Xietang Commune in Wu County stipulated that the harvest should generally begin on October 17th. After an on-site survey by veteran farmers, technicians, and cadres, the 5th Team believed that some rice could be harvested one day earlier, without mechanically adhering to the specific date stipulated for the start of the harvest. As a result, the harvest was timely, and the stubble was cleared in time, facilitating the autumn planting work. This example powerfully illustrates the complexity and meticulousness of agricultural production. Measures must be taken according to local conditions and time to ensure targeted and foolproof results; and in fact, only by allowing the team to formulate its short-term plan can the spirit of adapting to local conditions and time be truly implemented. Of course, allowing the team to flexibly and proactively arrange its short-term plans does not mean that leadership can be relaxed.
    Implement the Mass Line
    Upholding and implementing the mass line and the class line is an important condition for formulating and adhering to short-term plans. To formulate a good short-term plan, appropriate arrangements must be made according to the urgency and importance of agricultural tasks, and manpower must be rationally deployed according to the strength and technical level of the labor force, with the necessary farm tools, draught cattle, and other measures provided. This requires adhering to the working method of the mass line. Only by fully mobilizing the masses, allowing everyone to express their opinions, and then concentrating and summarizing them, can the plan be guaranteed to be practical and feasible. Only when every commune member knows what they should do and how to do it can the plan be guaranteed not to fail. Some masses have spoken deeply on this issue: "To be Zhuge Liang before the event, you must consult more 'shoemakers.' One tree does not make a forest, and a thousand-pound burden must be shared by everyone." Guizhuang Commune in Taicang County is a grain and cotton intercropping area. When formulating short-term plans, many teams mobilized the masses to discuss the contradictions between grain and cotton crops in terms of labor arrangement and season during the autumn harvest and planting. As a result, the work of harvesting and planting grain was done well, and the progress of cotton picking and sales was also very fast. In Qiandun Commune, Kunshan County, the autumn planting specifications and requirements of each team were discussed by the masses, short-term plans were formulated, and autumn harvest and planting covenants were established. Operating procedures were adhered to, and a continuous acceptance system was implemented. Therefore, the efficiency and quality of autumn harvest and planting were high. The above examples all illustrate that the formulation of short-term plans must adhere to the working method of "from the masses, to the masses."
    Relying on the masses, especially on the active elements among the poor and lower-middle peasants, is the only way to ensure the implementation of the Party's policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and various specific policies. What class says what, and what kind of people will make what kind of plans and do what kind of things. When organizing the work of threshing, weighing, and storing grain, some people in the 1st Team of the Xihu Brigade of the Yuecheng Commune in Jiangyin County believed that since the grain had already been brought to the threshing ground, threshing, weighing, and storing could be done slowly. This opinion was opposed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. Poor peasant Chen Jinmei said: "We must grasp grain production from beginning to end, planting well, managing well, harvesting well, and ensuring that every grain is stored in the warehouse." Poor peasant Gu Jinxiang also said: "Now the grain in the warehouse also has my share, and only by quickly transporting the grain into the warehouse can I feel at ease." The "slowly" argument was refuted, and threshing, weighing, and storing was finally listed as an important part of the short-term plan. As a result, the state grain purchase task was completed ahead of schedule, and food rations and seeds were transported to special warehouses separately. Everyone was satisfied and at ease. After the grain yield and distribution were finalized, the field management of autumn-sown crops was also vigorously promoted.
    Formulate Labor Quotas and Persist in Work Evaluation and Point Recording
    Reasonably formulating labor quotas and adhering to work evaluation and point recording are important guarantees for implementing short-term plans. Formulating reasonable labor quotas can encourage the masses' enthusiasm for labor, enhance commune members' sense of responsibility for production, and ensure the implementation of the plan. Work evaluation and point recording, which implements the socialist principle of distribution according to labor, can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and vigorously promote the advance of the production movement. In the later stage of late rice harvesting, some production teams failed to revise the labor quotas for harvesting and planting in a timely manner as conditions such as drought changed when formulating short-term plans. As a result, some commune members had opinions and this affected the harvesting and planting work. The Xiajieduan Production Team of the Sufeng Brigade of the Ouqu Commune in Changshu County paid attention to this issue and made timely and reasonable adjustments, grasping harvesting on the one hand and planting on the other, and completed autumn planting ahead of schedule. When formulating labor quotas, the cadres of the 5th Team of the Hengjing Brigade of the Chengbei Commune in Kunshan County also took the initiative to determine the advanced quota level and implemented standards that ordinary commune members could reach through active labor. As a result, the attendance of the masses was sufficient, and everyone reached the quota standard. On the basis of reasonable quotas, adhering to work evaluation and point recording, and more pay for more work, vigorously promoted production.
    Material guarantees must be combined with political command. Politics is the soul, and only when politics takes command first can the direction be correct and the labor quota problem can be better handled.
    Cadres Lead the Masses to Implement Short-Term Plans
    The continuous improvement and enhancement of cadres' work style is also an important key to adhering to short-term plans. Cadres are the locomotives, and they must lead the masses forward. The quality of cadres' work style has a great impact on the implementation of short-term plans. When implementing short-term plans in various places in the Suzhou Special Zone, cadres were particularly required to further improve their work style. First, participate in labor and take the lead in implementing short-term plans. Zhao Zhixiang, the captain of the 1st Team of the 6th Brigade of the Leyu Commune in Changshu County, not only participated in production after improving his work style, but also joined the labor group, worked with the commune members, and was evaluated and recorded points in the same way, which was well received by the commune members. Second, be selfless and impartial. When arranging manpower, cadres' family members are subject to allocation like commune members, and they never pick and choose. Third, be meticulous and thorough. The 4th Team of the Jinxing Brigade of the Xizhang Commune in Changshu County had more late-maturing varieties. It was originally planned to start harvesting on October 25th, but the team leader led technicians and veteran farmers to inspect the fields again on the 22nd and found that 32 mu of late rice had ripened due to fine processing. He arranged manpower in advance and rushed to harvest all the ripened late rice in two days. Fourth, while grasping production, take care of life, run the canteen well, so that commune members have both work and rest, and are energetic to better complete short-term plans and overfulfill the tasks they should do.

    因人因地制宜组织生产
    ——苏州专区生产小队制订小段计划的经验	中共苏州地委通讯组	  放手让小队制订小段计划
    根据苏州专区各地的经验，要搞好生产小队的小段计划，首要的关键在于公社、大队正确地发挥生产小队的作用，既加强领导，又不干涉过多，规定过死。因为公社、大队的生产计划是建立在小队的“三包”基础上的，而小队正是“三包”的包产单位。让小队根据自己的情况灵活地安排自己的小段计划，就能针对实际、有的放矢地组织与安排生产，采取措施，力争超产，取得更大更好的收成。今年秋收开始，苏州专区许多生产小队都组织了老农、技术员采取田头踏看的办法，根据熟一块收一块的要求，制订了秋收的小段计划，决定了每块田收割的先后次序，安排力量，组织行动，结果收得既适时，质量也很好，脱粒不净的现象大大减少了。
    生产小队的小段计划制订得好，主动灵活地妥善安排自己的农活，是搞好生产的重要条件。吴县斜塘公社第十三大队在晚稻收割时，规定一般都应在10月17日开镰。第五小队经过老农、技术员和干部的实地勘察，认为有些稻子可以提前一天收割，不必机械执行开镰的具体日期的规定，结果收得既适时，又及时腾出茬口，搞好了秋种工作。这个事例有力地说明了农业生产的复杂性和细致性，必须因地因时制宜地采取措施，才能有的放矢、百无一失；而事实上只有让小队订好小段计划，才能真正贯彻因地因时制宜的精神。当然，让小队灵活主动地安排自己的小段计划，也绝不是意味着可以放松领导。
    贯彻执行群众路线
    坚持贯彻群众路线和阶级路线，是订好小段计划、坚持执行小段计划的重要条件。要订好小段计划，必须根据农活的轻重缓急作出妥善安排，根据劳力的强弱和技术水平的高低合理用兵，搭配必要的农具、耕牛和各项措施。这就非要坚持贯彻群众路线的工作方法不可。只有放手发动群众，各抒己见，然后经过集中归纳，才能保证计划的切合实际，确实可行；只有使每一个社员都知道了应该做些什么，怎样做的道理以后，才能保证计划不会落空。有些群众对这个问题说得很深刻：“要做事前诸葛亮，就要多请教几个‘臭皮匠’，独木不成桥，千斤担子要交众人挑。”太仓县归庄公社是个粮棉夹种地区，许多小队在制订小段计划的时候，发动群众讨论了秋收秋种中粮、棉作物在劳力安排和季节上的矛盾，结果既做好了粮食的收种工作，棉花采摘交售进度也很快。昆山县茜墩公社各个小队的秋种规格和要求，都是经过群众讨论，制定了小段计划，并且订立了秋收秋种公约，坚持操作规程，实行连环验收制度，因而秋收秋种工效高、质量好。以上事例，都说明了制订小段计划必须坚持从群众中来，到群众中去的工作方法。
    依靠群众，首先依靠贫农、下中农中的积极分子，才能保证贯彻执行党的“多快好省”的方针和各项具体政策。什么阶级说什么话，什么样人就会订什么样的计划，做出什么样的事来。江阴县月城公社西湖大队第一小队在组织粮食脱粒过秤入仓的工作中，制订小段计划的时候，有些人认为粮食已经登场，脱粒过秤入仓可以慢慢来。这种意见遭到了贫农、下中农的反对。贫农陈金美说：“大办粮食要自始至终抓紧，种好、管好、收好，还要保证颗颗粮食都入仓。”贫农顾金相还说：“如今仓库的粮食也有我的一份，只有赶紧把粮食运进仓库才能定心。”把“慢慢来”的论调驳倒了，终于把脱粒过秤入仓列为小段计划的重要一部分。结果，提前完成了国家粮食征购任务，口粮、种子，也都分别运入专仓，人人满意，个个定心。粮食产量和分配落实后，又有力地促进了秋播作物的田间管理工作。	制订劳动定额坚持评工记分
    合理制订劳动定额，坚持评工记分，是贯彻执行小段计划的重要保证。制订合理的劳动定额，就可以鼓舞群众劳动热情，增强社员的生产责任心，保证计划的实施。评工记分，贯彻了社会主义按劳分配的原则，可以充分调动群众的积极性，有力地推动生产运动的前进。晚稻收刈后期，有的生产小队在制订小段计划的时候，没有及时将收、种的劳动定额随着天气干旱等条件的变化及时修订，部分社员因而有意见，并且影响了收种工作。常熟县藕渠公社苏锋大队下界段生产小队注意了这个问题，及时作了合理调整，一手抓收，一手抓种，就提前完成了秋种。昆山县城北公社横泾大队第五小队制订劳动定额时，干部还亲自动手，摸出先进的定额水平，并落实在一般社员经过积极劳动就可能达到的标准上，因而群众出勤既足，又个个达到了定额标准。在定额合理的基础上，坚持评工记分，多劳多得，有力地推动了生产。
    物质保证必须和政治挂帅相结合。政治是灵魂，只有政治先挂帅，方向才对头，才能更好地处理劳动定额问题。	干部带动群众执行小段计划
    干部作风不断的改进和提高，对于坚持执行小段计划也是个重要的关键问题。干部是火车头，要带动群众前进。干部作风的好坏，对于执行小段计划的影响很大。苏州专区在各地执行小段计划时，都特别要求干部进一步改进作风。一是参加劳动，带头执行小段计划。常熟县乐余公社第六大队第一小队队长赵志祥，改进作风后，不仅自己参加生产，而且也编入了劳动小组，与社员一起劳动，一样评工记分，社员反映很好。二是大公无私。在安排劳力时，干部家属和社员一样，服从调配，决不拣精挑肥。三是细致深入。常熟县西张公社金星大队四小队晚熟的品种较多，本来准备在10月25日开镰收割，但小队长在22日带领技术员、老农又踏田检查了一遍，发现有三十二亩晚稻由于加工精细已经黄熟，他就提前安排劳力，在两天内把已成熟的晚稻全部抢收上场。四是在抓生产的同时抓好生活，办好食堂，使社员有劳有逸，精力充沛，更好地完成小段计划和超额完成应做的任务。
