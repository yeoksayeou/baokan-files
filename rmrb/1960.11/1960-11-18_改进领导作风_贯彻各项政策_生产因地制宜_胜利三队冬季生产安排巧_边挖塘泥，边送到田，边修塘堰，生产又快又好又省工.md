Improve Leadership Style, Implement Various Policies, and Adapt Production to Local Conditions
Victory Team Three's Winter Production Arrangement is Ingenious
Digging Pond Mud, Delivering it to the Fields, and Repairing Pond Embankments Simultaneously, Making Production Fast, Good, Efficient, and Labor-Saving

(Reported by our newspaper) The Third Production Team of the Victory Management Area of the Luoyang People's Commune in Suixian County, Hubei Province, has achieved new successes in winter production and successfully completed the autumn planting because it implemented policies this year. Various tasks are well-organized, down-to-earth, and the enthusiasm of the commune members is high.

This year, this production team laid a solid foundation for winter production by carrying out autumn planting quickly and well. To capitalize on this victory, the production team made reasonable divisions of labor, from leadership to labor allocation, for livelihood issues, diversified operations, fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy construction, and field management. It ensured that every task had a dedicated team and that everything was taken care of. In view of the large autumn planting area and the large demand for fertilizer this year, as well as the large-scale construction of small ponds and embankments, they adopted a method of combining fertilizer accumulation, field management, and water conservancy construction, digging pond mud, delivering it to the fields, and repairing pond embankments simultaneously. The commune members generally reflected that the three-combination method achieved three goals at once, and it was fast, good, efficient, and labor-saving.

Resolutely implementing policies and giving full play to the production enthusiasm of production teams and commune members is the driving force for doing a good job in winter production. This year, this team has achieved three implementations and three fulfillments, namely: three guarantees implemented, rewards and punishments fulfilled; output implemented, rations fulfilled; income implemented, wages fulfilled. Before formulating the 1961 three-guarantee plan, they first checked the implementation of the 1960 three-guarantee plan and rewarded the first and second production teams, which exceeded production in summer and autumn, with more than 300 yuan. On this basis, they mobilized the masses to formulate next year's summer grain production "three guarantees" in a realistic manner based on the actual output of grain production this year and with reference to the normal output. There was room for exceeding production and rewards to be earned, so they were very motivated. In order to ensure that output was implemented and rations fulfilled, the team calculated the three accounts of output, grain retention, and state purchase during the autumn harvest distribution, and organized cadres, accountants, and commune member representatives to conduct inventory and handover, and implement rations to the canteen, and handed over the family property to the masses. Implement planned grain use, set quotas according to the number of people, save for oneself, and fulfill every five days. At the same time, special arrangements were made for the wages of commune members, and the money for paying wages from now until May next year was deposited in the credit cooperative for special use to ensure that commune members received their wages every month. In addition, this team implemented a system of small-section contracting and quota setting in production, with a reward and punishment system, and the commune members were highly motivated, and the team's attendance rate was often maintained above 90%.

The commune members generally reflected that the team also arranged the lives of the commune members well, so that everyone could work in peace without any worries. In addition to implementing rations to the canteen, setting quotas for each person, notifying each household, and paying wages every month, the canteen's housekeeping production was also good. The vegetables in the vegetable base were well grown, and rapeseed was intercropped in more than 400 mu of wheat fields. Together with the commune members' private vegetable plots, the commune members had enough vegetables to eat. The canteen was also well-managed, and accounts were announced every month. While leading production well, they also paid attention to ensuring the rest of the commune members and adhered to the holiday system. On holidays, some commune members engaged in private sideline occupations, some planted private plots, and some went to the streets to buy things or visited relatives during the holidays. Before the arrival of the cold winter, the team arranged for manpower to repair the dilapidated houses of the commune members, and recently took out some public welfare funds for a one-time subsidy to individual households with large families and difficulties.

"The cadres discuss everything with us, the production is very much to our liking, everyone is very united, and we work fast and well." This is the evaluation of the old commune member Chen Datong of the Third Production Team on the cadres' adherence to the mass line. This team has hilly land, valley fields, and alluvial fields, as well as yellow soil fields and white sandy soil fields. There are differences in seasons and technical operations. On this issue, the cadres of this team fully mobilized the masses, and production was adapted to local conditions. As long as it met the requirements of increasing grain production and increasing income, the team tried its best to let the small team cadres and the commune members be the masters. During the autumn planting, the management area arranged for sowing five days before the frost. The old commune member Hong Chuanxi of the Fourth Production Team said: "The arrangement of the higher authorities is for the entire management area. Our team's fields are mostly near the mountains, with winding depressions, and not very sunny. If we plant them late, they will not grow well. It is more appropriate to plant them a few days after the Cold Dew." As a result, the small team advanced the sowing according to his opinion, and now the wheat seedlings are growing very well. The cadres of the production team have initially explored some methods of increasing production in a balanced manner by adapting to local conditions due to their in-depth leadership in production. For example, planting should start from the valleys, and management should start from the valleys. This is because the valley fields should be started early in the season, and at the same time, these fields are far from the village and do not attract much attention. From the beginning of autumn planting, they paid attention to grasping the valley fields, tapping the potential of these fields, and striving for balanced production increases.

Because the cadres of this production team have further changed their style of work, resolutely implemented policies, and arranged their lives well, they have greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the commune members, and winter production is solid and reliable. In the inspection and evaluation of the entire management area on November 2, it was rated as a first-class team.

    改进领导作风　贯彻各项政策　生产因地制宜
    胜利三队冬季生产安排巧
    边挖塘泥，边送到田，边修塘堰，生产又快又好又省工
    本报讯　湖北省随县洛阳人民公社胜利管理区第三生产队由于今年贯彻执行政策，不仅胜利完成秋种，冬季生产也出现了新气象，各项活路有条不紊，扎扎实实，社员情绪高涨。
    今年这个生产队由于秋种搞得又快又好，给冬季生产打下了良好的基础。为了乘胜前进，生产队对于生活问题、多种经营、积肥、兴修水利、田间管理等，从领导到劳力安排进行合理分工。作到了行行有专班，事事有人管。他们针对今年秋种面积大需肥多和大量兴修小塘堰的特点，采取了积肥、田间管理、兴修水利三结合的办法，边挖塘泥，边送到田，边修塘堰。社员们普遍反映三结合的办法是一举三得，又快又好又省工。
    坚决贯彻政策，充分发挥生产小队和社员的生产积极性，是搞好冬季生产的动力。今年这个队做到了三落实三兑现，即：三包落实，奖惩兑现；产量落实，口粮兑现；收入落实，工资兑现。在制订1961年三包方案以前，首先检查了1960年三包方案的执行情况，对夏秋两季超产的一、二两个小队奖励了三百多元。在这个基础上，又发动群众，根据今年粮食生产的实际产量，参照常年的产量，由小队实事求是地制定了明年夏粮生产的“三包”，并且有产可超，有奖可得，干劲很足。为了做到产量落实，口粮兑现，在秋收分配时，全队算了产量、留粮和征购的三笔账，组织干部、会计、社员代表进行清仓盘点，把口粮落实到食堂，把家底交给群众。实行计划用粮，依人定量，节约归己，五天一兑现。与此同时，对社员的工资专门作了安排，把从现在到明年5月发工资的钱存入信用部，专款专用，保证社员按月得到工资。此外，这个队在生产中实行小段包工定额的制度，有奖惩制度，社员的生产积极性很高，全队出勤率经常保持在90％以上。
    社员普遍反映，队里对社员的生活也安排得好，使大家安心生产，别无挂牵。这个队除了口粮落实到食堂，指标到人，通知到户，月月发工资外，食堂家底生产也不错。蔬菜基地的菜种得好，还在四百多亩麦地里套种了油菜，加上社员私人菜地，社员有足够的菜吃。食堂办得也好，月月公布账目。在领导好生产的同时，还注意保证社员的休息，坚持实行休假制度。一到假日，有的社员搞点私人的副业活路，有的种自留地，也有的上街买点东西或趁假日走走亲戚。在寒冬到来之前，对社员年久失修的房屋，队里安排了力量进行修理，对个别家大口阔的困难户，最近拿出部分公益金进行了一次补助。
    “干部有说有商量，生产很合我们的味道，大家很齐心，干得又快又好。”这是三小队老社员陈大统对干部走群众路线的评语。这个队有丘陵地、有山凹田、也有冲田，有黄土田、也有白沙土田，不论在季节上或技术操作上，都有所不同。在这个问题上，这个队的干部充分发动群众，生产做到因地制宜，只要是符合增产粮食增加收入的要求，尽量让小队干部和让社员当家作主。秋种时，管理区布置在霜降前五天播种。四小队老社员洪川喜说：“上级布置是全管理区的，我们这个队的田靠山边多，弯弯凹凹，不大向阳，种迟了就长不好，要提早在寒露后几天种完合适些。”结果小队根据他的意见提早播种，现在麦苗长得很好。生产队的干部由于深入领导生产，已初步摸索出一些因地制宜均衡增产的办法，比如：种要从山凹种出来，管要从山凹管出来。这是因为山凹田在季节上宜早动手，同时这些田离村子较远不大引人注意。从秋种开始，他们就注意了抓山凹田，挖掘这些田的潜力，力争均衡增产。
    这个生产队由于干部进一步转变作风，坚决贯彻政策，生活安排得好，大大地鼓舞了社员的生产积极性，冬季生产扎扎实实，在11月2日全管理区的检查评比中，被评为一类队。
