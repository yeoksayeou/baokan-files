    A Good Way to Achieve High Quality and High Output
    Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3 Holds Quality Analysis Meetings Well
    (Our Dispatch) Qingdao State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 3 has adopted the form of quality analysis meetings to mobilize the masses to improve product quality. The first-class product rate of "Sanba" fine cloth rose rapidly from 59.83% in September to 85% in October, and the production efficiency of looms in October increased by 28.4% compared with September.
    There are roughly two types of quality analysis meetings. One is a quality analysis meeting combining leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers. The participants include the Party Committee Secretary, the Factory Director, the heads of various workshops, relevant engineering and technical personnel, and some production team leaders and workers, generally held two to three times a week. The other is a quality analysis meeting based on production teams. After work every day, the production team leader announces the quality situation at the meeting, and everyone analyzes the causes of good and bad results. The former type of meeting analyzes the overall situation, such as which aspects of quality are poor, whether it is caused by the spinning department or the weaving department, whether there is a problem with the machinery or a defect in the worker's operation. The latter type analyzes the specific causes of defective products for each machine and each person, and makes corresponding resolutions for the analyzed problems, assigning responsibilities and setting deadlines for breakthroughs.
    Quality analysis meetings are also appraisal meetings and experience exchange meetings. The quality of the products of a unit or an individual reflects the quality of their work and the level of their technical skills. Under clear comparison, mutual promotion and mutual learning can be achieved. Therefore, through quality analysis meetings, first of all, employees have further established a quality perspective, checking and analyzing every day, strengthening their sense of responsibility. In their work, they not only try every means to improve their skills and improve their operations, so that their operational skills meet the requirements of improving product quality, but also actively seek solutions to problems affecting quality, such as machinery and process design. Secondly, through quality analysis meetings, key points are identified at each level, so that everyone can concentrate their efforts on solving them. For example, within the entire factory, eight key factors affecting the quality of cloth have been identified. The reasons for these "eight harms" are poor mechanical condition, non-strict operation, and imperfect management. Each workshop, each work section, and even each machine and each person identify the key factors affecting quality. Therefore, the Party Committee promptly put forward the requirements of eliminating the "eight harms" and breaking through the "three barriers," so that the main attack direction of the entire factory became clear, the goals were concentrated, and the actions were unified, achieving obvious results. In the post-spinning workshop alone, in eliminating the "eight harms" and breaking through the "three barriers," 540,000 oil stain defects were caught in one month, reducing the number of defects per hundred pieces of cloth from 1,900 in September to the current 600. Through quality analysis meetings, the mass movement of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping, centered on operation drills, has also been promoted. Since September, more than 50 operation performances have been held throughout the factory, with more than 310,000 participants observing and learning, and more than 1,500 people have reached the level of operation experts. Furthermore, quality analysis meetings have exposed weaknesses in management work, and a mass movement to greatly improve enterprise management has been launched throughout the factory to address these problems, establishing and improving various systems, making production order increasingly perfect. In addition, quality analysis meetings have strengthened the work of groups and trained the ability of groups to operate independently. In order to hold quality analysis meetings well, Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League group leaders have more timely grasped the ideological and production situation of each person in the group, inspiring, guiding, and helping individuals at the group meetings, thereby improving the leadership ability of the group leaders. At the same time, with activities based on groups, there are fewer people and concentrated energy, and everyone has the opportunity to express their opinions, which can fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Employees said, "Who wouldn't be happy to participate in a meeting that solves problems like this?"

    优质高产的一个好办法
    青岛国棉三厂开好质量分析会
    本报讯　青岛国棉三厂采取质量分析会议的形式，发动群众提高产品质量，10月份的三八细布正品率由9月份的59.83％迅速上升到85％，布机生产效率10月份比9月份提高了28.4％。
    质量分析会议大体上有两种，一种是领导干部、工程技术人员和工人三结合的质量分析会议，参加的人员有党委书记、厂长、各车间主任、有关工程技术人员和部分生产组长与工人，一般每周两次到三次；另一种是以生产小组为单位的质量分析会议，每天下班后利用短时间由生产组长把质量情况在会上公布，大家分析好坏的原因。前一种会议分析出总的情况，如质量不好是那几方面的问题，是纺部造成的还是织部造成的？是机械有毛病还是工人操作有缺点？后一种就分析每台机器、每个人造成次品的具体原因，针对分析出的问题做出相应的决议，分工负责限期突破。
    质量分析会议也是评比会，又是经验交流会，那个单位、那个人的产品质量好坏，就反映出他的工作好坏和技术水平的高低，在鲜明的对比下，可以互相促进互相学习。因此，通过质量分析会议，首先使职工进一步树立了质量观点，天天检查、天天分析，加强了责任感，在工作中不仅千方百计提高技术，改进操作，使操作技术适应提高产品质量要求，而且寻找机械、工艺设计等影响质量的问题，积极解决。其次，通过质量分析会议层层排出了关键，使大家能够集中力量解决。如在全厂范围内排出影响布的质量的关键有八个，造成这“八害”的原因是机械状态不良，操作不严格，管理不完善。各车间、各工段以至每台机器、每个人都找出影响质量的关键。于是，党委及时提出了除“八害”、破“三关”的要求，使全厂的主攻方向明确了，目标集中了，行动一致了，取得了明显效果。仅后纺车间在除“八害”、破“三关”中，一个月就抓油污疵点五十四万个，使布面每百匹的疵点由9月份的一千九百个降低到现在的六百个。通过质量分析会议，还推动了以操作练兵为中心的学、比、赶、帮的群众运动。全厂从9月份以来就举行过操作表演五十多次，参加观摩学习的达三十一万多人次，有一千五百多人达到了操作能手的水平。再是，通过质量分析会议揭露出管理工作上的薄弱环节，针对这些问题在全厂范围内掀起了大搞企业管理的群众运动，建立健全了各种制度，使生产秩序日趋完善。此外，通过质量分析会议还加强了小组工作，锻炼了小组单独活动的能力。党、政、工、团小组长为了开好小组质量分析会议，就更及时地去掌握组内每人的思想情况和生产情况，在小组会上启发、诱导、个别帮助，从而提高了小组长的领导能力。同时以小组为单位活动，人员少，精力集中，每人都有发表意见的机会，能够充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，可以做到集思广益，职工们说：“这样解决问题的会议，谁不乐意参加呢？”
