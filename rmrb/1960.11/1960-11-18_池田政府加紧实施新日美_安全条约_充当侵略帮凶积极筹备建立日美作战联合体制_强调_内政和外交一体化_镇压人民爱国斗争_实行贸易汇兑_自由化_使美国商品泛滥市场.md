Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: This reporter reports: The Japanese Ikeda government, in its "new policies," explicitly declares that it will "maintain the Japan-U.S. security (treaty) system." In recent campaign speeches, Ikeda spared no effort in attacking the progressive parties'主張about Japan pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality, and reiterated that his government would "adhere to the security (treaty) system." Ikeda Hayato's words and deeds in the four months since he came to power are enough to show that the main task assigned to him by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries is to inherit the work that Kishi Nobusuke failed to complete due to the heavy blows suffered by the people—to faithfully implement the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." For Ikeda Hayato, this election is merely a means for him to carry out this task.

In order to implement the clauses of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty that stipulate Japan as an accomplice in U.S. aggression, the Ikeda cabinet is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations and is actively preparing to establish a joint Japan-U.S. war system.

Japanese "Defense Agency" Director-General Ezaki Masumi instructed at a secret meeting of "Self-Defense Forces" officers on September 28 that "in order to cope with local wars in the Far East," "Japan needs to quickly prepare its defense capabilities in accordance with the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty." He also said that this is an "urgent task at present." The Japanese "Defense Agency's" "business plan" for the next fiscal year also clearly stipulates that it will "establish a joint Japan-U.S. war headquarters" in order to "unify the command of the Japanese army, navy, and air force in accordance with the U.S. Far East strategy."

The "Defense Agency" has also decided to establish a "Destroyer" anti-submarine force in order to "cooperate with" the U.S. Seventh Fleet to "ensure the sea lanes of the Western Pacific connecting Saipan, the Philippines, and Japan, and to undertake joint anti-submarine operations."

The Ikeda cabinet is not only tying Japan more tightly to the U.S. war chariot but is also actively preparing to establish a Northeast Asian military alliance including Japan, South Korea, and the Chiang Kai-shek group, based on the so-called "collective self-defense rights" stipulated in the new "Security Treaty." To this end, the Ikeda government sent Foreign Minister Kosaka to the United States and South Korea and sent Senate Speaker Matsuno Tsuruhei to Taiwan to discuss the establishment of this aggressive group.

A domestic political system adapted to the U.S.-Japan military alliance is being established. The Ikeda cabinet emphasizes the need to "integrate internal affairs and diplomacy." As soon as it came to power, it severely punished and suppressed people who participated in the just struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" on a large scale. When this fascist suppression failed to stop the people's struggle, the Ikeda cabinet did not hesitate to resort to terror, condoning fascist thugs to assassinate Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma. Taking advantage of this assassination, the Ikeda cabinet manipulated the Diet to pass a so-called "exclusion of violence" resolution, putting a "legal" cloak on the fascist activities of suppressing people's demonstrations and gatherings. Its "Defense Agency" also distributed "Public Security Action Manuals" to various units, stipulating that the Japanese army should "brutally suppress the people's just struggles in accordance with general combat operations." The Ikeda cabinet not only newly established a "Ministry of Autonomy" after coming to power but also prepared to establish a "Minister of Intelligence" to strengthen the secret service activities of persecuting the people, turning Japan into a police state.

According to the requirements of U.S. imperialism, the Ikeda cabinet is conspiring to establish an education system to serve the policies of aggression and war. It reappointed Araki Mansuo, the wartime Minister of Education, and openly declared that it would revise the "Basic Law on Education" in order to instill militarist ideas and deprive teaching staff of freedom of political thought. With the approval of the Ikeda cabinet, some films praising Japan's war of aggression are being shown in various parts of Japan; Japanese militarists have also openly established "monuments" for war criminals such as Hideki Tojo, who launched the Pacific War.

The Ikeda government is also actively implementing the provisions of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty on strengthening Japan-U.S. "economic cooperation." It implements a trade and exchange "liberalization" policy, allowing American goods and surplus agricultural products to flood the Japanese domestic market freely. According to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the implementation of this policy will result in 1.37 million people in Japan becoming unemployed within three years, and countless farmers will be hit and bankrupted. In order to establish an industrial system that can provide modern equipment for aggression and war, the Ikeda government is stepping up the promotion of "enterprise rationalization" in various industrial sectors, laying off large numbers of workers. In rural areas, a "Basic Agricultural Law" has also been formulated, preparing to drive 60% of the farmers out of the countryside and deprive them of their land in order to serve as cheap labor and sources of soldiers for arms expansion.

During the election campaign, the Ikeda government tried its best to carry out deceptive propaganda such as "doubling national income" and tried to avoid the issue of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." However, the Japanese people have already personally experienced in their lives that the Ikeda government's policy of actively implementing the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty, which endangers peace in the Far East, is further trampling on Japan's national sovereignty, depriving democratic freedoms, and bringing more and more pain and disaster to the people. They are determined to fight to the end to abolish the "Security Treaty" and resolutely take the path of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality.

    池田政府加紧实施新日美“安全条约”
    充当侵略帮凶积极筹备建立日美作战联合体制
    强调“内政和外交一体化”镇压人民爱国斗争
    实行贸易汇兑“自由化”使美国商品泛滥市场
    新华社17日讯　本社记者报道：日本池田政府在它的“新政策”中开宗明义地宣布，它将“保持日美安全（条约）体制”。在最近的竞选演说中，池田不遗余力地攻击进步党派关于日本执行和平中立政策的主张，并且重申他的政府要“坚持安全（条约）体制”。池田勇人上台四个月来的言行已经足够说明，美日反动派交给他的主要任务就是继承岸信介由于遭到人民的沉重打击而未能完成的工作——忠实地执行新日美“安全条约”。对池田勇人来说，这次大选只不过是他执行这项任务的一种手段。
    为了实施日美军事同盟条约中规定日本充当美国侵略帮凶的条款，池田内阁正在加紧扩军备战，并积极筹备建立日美联合作战体制。
    日本“防卫厅”长官江崎真澄9月28日在“自卫队”军官秘密会议上指示说：“为了应付在远东发生的局部战争”，“日本需要根据日美安全条约，赶紧准备防御力量”。他并说：这是“当前的紧急任务”。日本“防卫厅”的明年度“业务计划”还明确规定要“设立日美联合作战总部”，以便“按照美国的远东战略”统一指挥日本陆海空军。
  “防卫厅”并决定建立“歼灭者”反潜艇部队以便同美国第七舰队
  “共同协作”，来“确保连接塞班岛、菲律宾和日本的西太平洋海上交通线和担当反潜艇共同作战任务”。
    池田内阁不仅正在把日本更紧地捆在美国战车上，而且还在根据新“安全条约”规定的所谓“集体自卫权”，积极筹备建立包括日本、南朝鲜和蒋介石集团在内的东北亚军事联盟。为此，池田政府曾经派遣外务相小坂到美国和南朝鲜，派参议院议长松野鹤平到台湾，会谈了建立这个侵略集团的问题。
    适应日美军事同盟的国内政治体制正在建立中。池田内阁强调要使“内政和外交一体化”。它一上台首先大批地处分和镇压了参加反对日美“安全条约”正义斗争的人们。当这种法西斯镇压未能阻止人民的斗争时，池田内阁不惜采取了恐怖手段，纵容法西斯暴徒杀害了社会党委员长浅沼稻次郎。利用这个刺杀事件，池田内阁又操纵国会通过了所谓“排除暴力”决议，为镇压人民示威、集会的法西斯活动披上“合法”外衣。它的“防卫厅”还向各部队分发了“治安行动教范”，规定日本军队要“按照一般作战行动”来残酷镇压人民的正义斗争。池田内阁不仅上台后新设了“自治省”，而且还准备设立“情报相”，加强迫害人民的特务活动，把日本变成警察国家。
    根据美帝国主义的要求，池田内阁正在阴谋建立为侵略和战争政策服务的教育制度。它起用了战时的文部大臣荒木万寿夫，并且公开宣称要修改“教育基本法”，以便灌输军国主义思想和剥夺教职员的政治思想自由。在池田内阁的赞许下，日本各地正在放映一些颂扬日本侵略战争的电影；日本军国主义分子还公然给发动太平洋战争的大战犯东条英机等建立了“纪念碑”。
    池田政府也在积极执行日美军事同盟条约中关于加强日美“经济合作”的规定。它实行贸易、汇兑
  “自由化”政策，让美国商品和剩余农产品自由泛滥于日本国内市场。仅仅据通商产业省宣布，由于实行这个政策，日本在三年内将有一百三十七万人失业，而遭受打击和破产的农民则不计其数。为了建立能够为侵略和战争提供现代装备的工业体制，在各个工业部门池田政府加紧推行大批解雇工人的“企业合理化”。在农村还制订了“农业基本法”，准备把60％的农民赶出农村，并剥夺他们的土地，以便充作廉价劳动力和扩军的兵源。
    池田政府在竞选活动中竭力进行要使“国民收入增加一倍”之类的欺骗宣传，并且尽量回避新日美
  “安全条约”问题。但是，日本人民已经在生活中亲身体会到，池田政府积极实行危害远东和平的日美军事同盟条约的政策，正进一步蹂躏日本民族主权，剥夺民主自由，给人民带来越来越多的痛苦和灾难。他们决心为废除“安全条约”斗争到底，坚决要走独立、民主、和平、中立的道路。
