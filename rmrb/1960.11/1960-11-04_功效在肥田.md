　　The Western capitalist world is on a downhill path in politics, economics, and culture. Culture is the vanguard, running especially fast. It's like throwing a stone down from the top of a mountain, rolling down and down, and no force can stop it.

　　Let's look at an admirable piece of strange writing:

　　"According to a report in the American magazine *Time* on October 10th, the American composer John Cage, who calls himself a non-expressionist, caused a storm at the recent Venice International Festival of Contemporary Music.

　　…In the third piece, when Cage was hammering the piano stool with a stone, the impatient audience began to laugh. By the fourth piece, Cage was pressing chords on the piano with his elbows, while violently hitting the piano's insides with knives and tin strips. The audience laughed even louder. In the sixth piece, Cage was hitting the piano lid with an iron pipe and throwing glass bottles on the floor. After this piece was finished, an elderly music lover walked onto the stage and vigorously hit Cage's piano with his cane, then walked out of the theater shouting, "Now I am a musician too!"...By the time the last piece was performed, fights had broken out everywhere in the theater...Cage roared at the audience, and the audience roared at Cage..."

　　Really, if knives, tin strips, iron pipes...hitting a piano is called music, then everyone is a musician.

　　Pornographic and murderous "movies" on the screen, fist-fighting and foot-kicking "art" on canvas, and violently hammering "music" on the piano, all reflect the class emotions of the Western decadent bourgeoisie. A decadent class, the closer it gets to death, the more it feels spiritual annoyance, distress, and emptiness. Everything that can be slightly called culture has no effect on their sensory nerves. The only thing they need is: all kinds of strange and bizarre stimulation.

　　The need for stimulation, stimulation, and more stimulation in "culture" is directly proportional to the pursuit of profit, profit, and even greater profit, and it is advancing and developing at the same speed.

　　A pile of rotten apples, the most common of which are two types: one has some rotten spots on the surface, and if you dig out these spots, you can still eat it; the other rots from the center, and when you cut it with a knife, it is moldy and black. The decadent "culture" that reflects and satisfies the spiritual state and needs of the Western decadent bourgeoisie is like a rotten apple rotting from the center. If these so-called "cultures" have any effect on us, it is to collect them as fertilizer.

　　　　Apples rot from the heart,
　　　　This is no ordinary part.
　　　　Moldy and black indeed,
　　　　Efficacy lies in fertilizing the field. (Includes picture)

    功效在肥田
    马铁丁文  华君武画
    西方资本主义世界，政治、经济、文化一齐走下坡路。文化是急先锋，跑得特别快。简直是高山之巅往下抛石头，骨碌碌地往下滚，什么力量也挡不住。
    且看一节可供欣赏的奇文：
    “美时代周刊10月10日消息，最近在威尼斯国际现代音乐节上，自称为非表现派的美国作曲家约翰·凯奇举行了一次演出，引起一场风暴。
    ……第三个节目，当凯奇正在用一块石头捶打着钢琴坐凳时，烦躁的听众开始嘲笑了。到第四个节目时，凯奇用手肘在钢琴上压出和弦，同时用刀子和锡条猛烈敲打钢琴的内脏，观众的嘲笑声更响了。在第六个节目中，凯奇用一条铁管猛打钢琴盖，并把玻璃瓶往地上扔。这个节目完毕后，一位老年音乐爱好者走上舞台，使劲用手杖捶击凯奇的钢琴，然后走出戏院喊道：“我现在也是音乐家了！”……到表演最后一个节目时，戏院到处都已打起架来。……凯奇对听众怒吼，听众也对凯奇怒吼……”
    真的，如果刀子、锡条、铁管……打在钢琴上都叫音乐，那么，谁都是音乐家了。
    在银幕上色情仇杀的“电影”，在画布上拳打足踢的“美术”，和在钢琴上穷捶狂击的“音乐”，却好反映了西方没落资产阶级的阶级情绪。一个没落的阶级，越在其接近死亡的时候，也就越感到精神的烦恼、苦闷和空虚，一切可以稍微称得起文化的文化，对它们的感应神经已经不起什么作用，它们唯一需要的是：各色各样，奇奇怪怪的刺激。
    刺激、刺激、再刺激的“文化”需要，与利润、利润、更大利润的私欲追求，适成正比例，而且是等速度地前进与发展。
    一堆烂苹果，其中最常见的有两种：一种是上面有一些腐烂的斑痕，把这斑痕挖掉，还是可以吃的；另一种是从中心烂起，一刀子切下去，发霉、发黑。反映和满足西方没落资产阶级精神状态及其需要的腐朽“文化”，正像从中心烂起的烂苹果一样。这些所谓“文化”，对我们来说，如果还有若干效用的话，那就是收集起来当肥料。
        苹果从心烂，
        这可不一般。
        发霉又发黑，
        功效在肥田。（附图片）
