Xinhua News Agency, 21st: In the rural areas of Sichuan, an agricultural science sowing team composed of teachers and students from Southwest Agricultural College is active. For more than a year, they have often carried instruments, books, and baggage, traversing mountains and ridges, their footprints covering 59 counties and cities in the province. Wherever they go, they diligently sow the seeds of agricultural science.

This sowing team disseminated a new silkworm breeding method to the silkworm farmers in Changshou County. After arriving in Changshou County this spring, they participated in labor with the silkworm farmers in the silkworm rearing houses. At that time, the silkworm farmers used old methods to raise silkworms, and the yield was not high. The teachers and students were determined to teach them the new silkworm rearing method that had been successfully tested at the school. They repeatedly experimented and researched to adapt the new silkworm rearing method successfully tested at the school to the specific local conditions, and absorbed the opinions of local farmers to improve the method of releasing silkworm leaves and reduce withered leaves. As a result, the number of silkworm feedings was reduced from twelve times a day and night to six times, the silkworms ate quickly and well, and labor was also saved. Due to the promotion of new silkworm rearing methods, the cocooning rate of silkworms was greatly accelerated, and the yield was doubled compared to the original. After the news spread, nearby silkworm farmers came to learn from them. With the support of the county party committee, the teachers and students immediately set up technical training classes to quickly promote the new silkworm rearing method throughout the county.

Santai County has always had rich experience in making indigenous pesticides, but pests and diseases have not been completely eradicated, and the members are troubled by this problem. After the teachers and students of Southwest Agricultural College came to Santai County, they were determined to help the members solve this problem. The teachers and students, together with local technicians and experienced farmers, formed a research team to collect specimens of indigenous pesticides everywhere, and carried out biological assays, refining, purification, and compound simplification work one by one. Once, in order to summarize the correct formula of pesticides used locally to prevent cotton wilt, they visited more than a dozen experienced farmers successively, moved the experimental instruments to the fields, and identified the experience of the experienced farmers one by one. The teachers and students explored arduously in this way, humbly learned from the peasants, and in a few months, they summarized more than 390 kinds of indigenous pesticide cultivation experiences, compiled a set of pesticide specimen records, and identified the best preparation methods for various indigenous pesticides, so that the efficacy of the drugs generally reached about 98%.

    让农业科学种子遍地开花
    西南农学院组成农业科学播种队  沈阳农学院支援农业配套成龙
    据新华社21日讯　在四川农村中，活跃着一支由西南农学院师生组成的农业科学播种队。一年多来，他们经常扛着仪器，带着书本，背着行囊，翻山越岭，足迹遍及省内五十九个县、市。他们走到哪里，就在哪里勤勤恳恳地撒播着农业科学的种子。
    这个播种队给长寿县的蚕农们传播了一套新育蚕法。他们今年春天来到长寿县后，在蚕房里和蚕农一起参加劳动。当时，蚕农们用老办法养蚕，产量不高，师生们决心把学校试验成功的新养蚕法传授给他们。他们反复地试验研究使学校里试验成功的新养蚕法适应当地的具体情况，并且吸取当地农民的意见改进了放蚕叶的方法，减少了枯叶。结果，喂蚕次数由原来一昼夜十二次减少到六次，蚕儿食得又快又好，还节省了劳力。由于推广新的养蚕方法，蚕儿出茧率大大加快，产量比原来提高一倍。消息传出去后，附近的蚕农纷纷前来取经要宝。师生们在县委支持下，立刻开办技术训练班，使新的养蚕方法很快在全县推广开来。
    三台县向来有着丰富的土农药制作经验，但病虫害仍然没有完全根绝，社员们都为这个问题苦恼。西南农学院师生来到三台县后，决心帮助社员们解除这个心上的疙瘩。师生们同当地的技术员、老农一起组成研究小组，到处收集土农药标本，一项项的进行生物测定、精炼提纯和复方简化工作。有一次，他们为了总结当地防治棉花枯萎病所用农药的正确配方，曾先后访问了十几个老农，把实验仪器般到田里，一项项地鉴定老农的经验。师生们就这样艰苦地探索着，虚心向农民请教，几个月时间就总结出三百九十多种土农药栽培经验，编出了一套农药标本志，鉴定出各种土农药最好的配制方法，使药效普遍达到98％左右。（附图片）
    沈阳农学院师生试制成功一套蔬菜生产机械，这套机械包括整地、播种栽苗到收获等十种工具。这是蔬菜秧苗种植机，把分好的秧苗连同营养钵一起栽到地里。
