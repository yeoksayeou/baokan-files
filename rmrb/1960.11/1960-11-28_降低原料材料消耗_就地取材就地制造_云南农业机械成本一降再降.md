Reducing Raw Material Consumption, Utilizing Local Materials for Local Manufacturing
Yunnan Agricultural Machinery Costs Drop Again and Again

Kunming, November 27th (People's Daily) – Agricultural machinery manufacturing departments in Yunnan Province are making every effort to reduce the cost of agricultural machinery. From January to October this year, the average cost of agricultural machinery in the province has decreased by more than 30% compared to the same period last year.

In order to reduce the cost of agricultural machinery products, Yunnan has first further established the ideology of "taking agriculture as the foundation" and "serving agricultural production" among cadres at all levels and the vast number of workers in the agricultural machinery sector. This year, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee repeatedly conducted this kind of education to cadres at all levels at the two provincial agricultural machinery conferences jointly convened. Under the guidance of the ideology of serving agricultural production, the agricultural machinery department of Lijiang Prefecture selected twenty representative products and repeatedly conducted cost accounting. After accounting, the cost of these agricultural machinery items was reduced by an average of 49.8%.

Fully tapping the internal production potential of enterprises and continuously improving labor productivity are the main ways for Yunnan to reduce the cost of agricultural machinery products. Since the beginning of this year, agricultural machinery manufacturing plants throughout Yunnan Province have focused on key and weak links in production, and carried out mass technical innovation and technical revolution movements in terms of product design, technology, equipment, and production organization. This has significantly improved the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization, and labor productivity compared to the beginning of the year, and greatly reduced the consumption quota of raw materials. The Kunming Tractor Factory's original Model 2160 thirty-five horsepower gas engine weighed 1,300 kilograms. Later, a series of technical innovations were carried out on the product, and the Model 4115 gas engine was manufactured, with horsepower increased to sixty, while the weight was reduced to 800 kilograms, saving more than 38% of raw materials, and reducing production costs by 1,600 yuan compared to the Model 2160 gas engine. Although the Chengjiang County Agricultural Machinery Factory transferred a large number of workers back to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, due to the factory's vigorous technical innovation and improvement of labor organization and enterprise management, the factory's daily output of threshers has increased by more than double compared to before the transfer of labor; due to the improvement of labor productivity, the cost of each thresher has also been reduced from 125.8 yuan to 57 yuan.

Yunnan's rural areas are mostly mountainous, with inconvenient transportation, and the province's natural conditions vary greatly, so the requirements for the specifications and varieties of agricultural machinery are also diverse. According to these characteristics, agricultural machinery factories at all levels in the province have carried out a reasonable division of labor. In addition to the fact that some mechanized and semi-mechanized products with higher technical requirements are manufactured separately by agricultural machinery factories belonging to the province, prefectures (autonomous prefectures), and counties, general semi-mechanized and improved agricultural tools are released to commune farm tool factories for production as much as possible. This can not only adapt agricultural machinery to local natural conditions, but also utilize local materials, greatly saving raw materials, fuel, and product transportation costs, thereby reducing the cost of agricultural machinery. According to surveys, the cost of products such as carts, wooden water turbines, and threshers has generally decreased by one-third to one-half after being released to commune factories for production.

### 降低原料材料消耗　就地取材就地制造  云南农业机械成本一降再降

    降低原料材料消耗　就地取材就地制造
    云南农业机械成本一降再降
    本报昆明27日电　云南省农业机械制造部门千方百计地降低农业机械的成本。今年1至10月，全省农业机械的成本平均比去年同期降低了30％以上。
    云南各地为降低农业机械产品成本，首先在农业机械部门的各级干部和广大职工中进一步树立
  “以农业为基础”、“为农业生产服务”的思想。今年中共云南省委和人委在联合召开的两次全省农业机械会议上，都反复地向各级干部进行了这种教育。丽江专区农业机械部门在为农业生产服务思想的指导下，挑选了二十种有代表性的产品，反复进行成本核算。经过核算以后，这些农业机械的成本平均降低了49.8％。
    充分挖掘企业内部的生产潜力，不断提高劳动生产率，是云南各地降低农业机械产品成本的主要途径。今年以来，云南省各农业机械制造厂都围绕着生产中的关键和薄弱环节，从产品设计、工艺、设备、生产组织等方面，开展了群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，使机械化半机械化程度和劳动生产率比年初有了显著的提高，原料材料的消耗定额大大降低。昆明拖拉机厂原来制造的二一六○型三十五马力的煤气机重量达一千三百公斤。后来对产品进行了一系列的技术革新，制造出四一一五型煤气机，马力增加为六十匹，而重量减少到八百公斤，节约原料材料38％以上，生产成本比二一六○型煤气机减少了一千六百元。澄江县农业机械厂虽然抽调了大批的职工回到农村参加农业生产，但由于厂里大搞技术革新、改善劳动组织和企业管理，这个厂打谷机的日产量比抽调劳动力以前还提高了一倍以上；由于劳动生产率的提高，每台打谷机的成本也由一百二十五元八角降低到五十七元。
    云南农村多山，交通运输不便，而且全省自然条件差异很大，对农业机械的规格品种要求也多种多样。根据这些特点，全省各级农业机械工厂进行了合理分工，除一些技术条件要求较高的机械化和半机械化产品分别由省、专区（自治州）和县属农业机械厂分工制造以外，凡是一般的半机械化和改良农具都尽量下放给公社农具厂生产。这样既可以因地制宜，使农业机具适应当地自然条件，又可就地取材，大大节约原料、材料、燃料和产品运转费用，从而降低农业机械的成本。据调查，大车、木制水轮机和打谷机等产品下放给公社工厂生产后，成本一般下降三分之一至一半。
