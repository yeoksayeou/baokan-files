    Hero Wang Yiyuan Attacks Key Problems
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Zhengjie

    On the red honor roll in the Tangshan Steel Plant, one name always ranks at the top. This is Wang Yiyuan, the well-known hero who attacks key problems, and his converter steelmaking team. By October of this year, Wang Yiyuan and his team had exceeded their plan for two years and one month consecutively, maintaining the champion position in quality, high yield, and low consumption.

    Speaking of Wang Yiyuan, workers familiar with him know the story of his "contracted steelmaking furnace." This happened in April of this year. Due to the increased sulfur content of the molten iron and insufficient blowing equipment, a "roadblock" suddenly appeared in production—short-lived converters. Each converter could only smelt an average of thirteen or fourteen heats, and sometimes it had to be shut down for repair after only five or six heats. The workers discussed it a lot. Wang Yiyuan, who had just returned from participating in a national converter technology tour, was also taken aback when he found out. He thought, there is an idiom in converter steelmaking: "High yield must have a long life." If this hurdle cannot be overcome, how can output be greatly increased? At this critical moment, he went to the party branch secretary and said, "Let us take on the task of breaking through the converter life barrier!" From then on, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to attacking this key point. Many people said that there were problems with the quality of the bricks and the construction. So he ran to the furnace repair team and carefully observed the process of boiling oil, bricklaying, and construction. What he saw was meticulous craftsmanship, without any flaws. He also drilled into the bad furnaces full of black smoke and checked the quality of the furnace bricks one by one, which were also impeccable. He thought, "I can't keep going down the same road. Could it be that the operation of the steelworkers has no impact on the life of the furnace lining?" He made up his mind to carefully observe the operations of the steelworkers in each team.

    "Little Xu, is our operation the same as other teams?" Wang Yiyuan suddenly asked his assistant Xu Yinsheng.

    "Each has his own unique method."

    As soon as Little Xu finished speaking, Wang Yiyuan immediately responded, "That's right, that's where the problem lies."

    After work, Wang Yiyuan proposed at the team meeting: "Each of our steelmaking teams has indicators for output, quality, and consumption, but there is no indicator for furnace lining life. Therefore, everyone doesn't think much about this. In addition, each team uses a furnace in rotation, and the operations are inconsistent. How can this not affect the furnace lining life?" Everyone felt it made sense. Wang Yiyuan suggested, "Our team should be divided into three shifts, day and night, to contract a furnace, operate continuously, and smelt to the end to see how many heats of steel can be smelted." His suggestion was unanimously supported by everyone.

    On May 6th, the "contracted furnace steelmaking" experiment began. As soon as the molten iron was loaded into the furnace and an assistant connected the wind gate to blow air, black and red flames burst out of the furnace mouth, constantly splashing iron particles. Based on experience, Wang Yiyuan knew that this was caused by overloading the molten iron and causing indigestion. He decisively transferred a ladle of molten iron and poured out more than six hundred catties of excess molten iron, and explained to the workers:
  "If too much molten iron is loaded, the blowing angle will be large, the wind eye will be corroded quickly, and the life of the furnace lining will be shortened. We should insist on loading the right amount of molten iron and use small-angle, surface-blowing methods to extend the life of the furnace lining."

    Unfortunately, good things rarely go smoothly. After slagging and taking a sample for analysis, the sulfur content of the molten iron exceeded the regulations by more than double. At this time, everyone couldn't hold their breath, and their eyes focused on Wang Yiyuan. What is most needed now is confidence and perseverance. Wang Yiyuan thought of this and immediately shouted: "Increase the air volume and slag off once more, and cure the disease of high sulfur first." After the second slagging, everyone continued to adhere to the small-angle, surface-blowing operation method. The flame gradually became brighter, and the steel sample test was completely qualified. The bell rang for tapping the steel. The first heat of steel was smelted in thirty-four minutes. When smelting the second heat of steel, Wang Yiyuan assigned three assistants to specialize in external desulfurization, and as a result, it only took thirty minutes to smelt it. Then the third heat, the fourth heat... thirty heats in one go, and the life of the furnace lining was more than doubled. Later, in cooperation with other teams, they also created a record of smelting one hundred and twenty-seven heats in a row.

    The entire plant was a sensation, and Wang Yiyuan could not hide his inner joy: he finally turned the converter from "short-lived" to "long-lived"!

    But for Wang Yiyuan, creation is endless. At a meeting to summarize the experience of "contracted furnace steelmaking," Party Secretary Li Dapu proposed: Now that the life of the furnace lining has been improved, shortening the smelting time has become a new key to increasing production. The words of the Party Secretary were exactly what Wang Yiyuan had in mind. Early the next morning, he asked the team workers to study and brainstorm ideas. But after much calculation, everyone's suggestions could not shorten the smelting time by much.

    "Can we add less lime and reduce its usage by half?" Wang Yiyuan's bold proposal made everyone stunned. In the past, people have always believed that in converter steelmaking, more lime must be added. The higher the sulfur content of the pig iron, the more lime is added. Adding lime has become an old rule for desulfurization. Wang Yiyuan's idea was obviously different from this convention. Based on his usual observations and experience, he explained to everyone: "Lime needs to absorb a lot of heat in the furnace to melt. The more lime added, the lower the furnace temperature, and the longer the smelting time. If we add less lime, can't the smelting time be shortened?" The team workers agreed with his opinion and carefully studied the technical measures for adding less lime. The Party Committee knew about it and immediately supported their experiment.

    During the experiment, Wang Yiyuan first did a good job of external desulfurization. After opening the furnace, according to the sulfur content of the molten iron, he only added ten kilograms of lime in the first batch, which was more than half less than usual. Sure enough, the furnace temperature rose quickly, and the flame was red and white. When the last slag was removed and steel was about to be tapped, the test results showed that the desulfurization effect was very good, but the sulfur content was still slightly high. "Tap the steel!" Wang Yiyuan shouted and quickly picked up an iron shovel and added two shovels of iron oxide scale to the pouring steel to reduce the sulfur content of the steel, so that the quality of the heat of steel reached the prescribed standard, and the smelting time was shortened to twenty-six minutes, and the lime consumption was reduced from 160 kilograms to 80 kilograms in the past.

    Wang Yiyuan was not satisfied with this result. When smelting the second heat of steel, he adopted the method of retaining slag and adding the second and third batches of materials into the hearth at one time. As a result, not only was the lime consumption reduced by another forty kilograms, but also only twenty minutes were used to smelt a heat of qualified steel.

    The temperament of the furnace became more and more transparent, and the smelting time was shortened heat by heat. His team finally created a new record of smelting a heat of steel in twelve minutes.

    Wang Yiyuan's advanced steelmaking experience quickly blossomed and bore fruit in various brother teams. As a result, the average life of converters in the entire plant was extended by more than double, the smelting time was greatly shortened, the lime consumption was generally reduced by half, and the unit output of steel was increased by more than 40%.

    攻关英雄王益元
    新华社记者　李正杰
    在唐山钢厂里的红色光荣榜上，有个名字老是排在最前头，这就是全厂闻名的攻关英雄王益元和他领导的转炉炼钢小组。到今年10月，王益元和他的小组已连续两年零一个月超额完成计划，保持着优质、高产和低耗的冠军。
    提起王益元，熟悉他的工人都知道他“包炉炼钢”的故事。那还是今年4月的事。由于铁水含硫量增高，鼓风设备不足，生产上突然出现了“拦路虎”——转炉短命，每座转炉平均只能炼十三、四炉，有时炼五、六炉就要停下来修炉。工人们一时议论纷纷。刚从全国各地参加转炉技术巡回表演回来的王益元知道了也大吃一惊。他想，转炉炼钢有句成语：“高产必须高寿。”这一关不破，怎么能大幅度提高产量？就在这个紧要当口，他找到党总支书记说：“把突破转炉寿命关的任务交给我们吧！”从此，他就一心一意地来攻打这个关键。不少人说打砖和修砌的质量有问题，他就跑到修炉组，仔细地观察了熬油、打砖和修砌的情况，看到的都是精雕细琢，没有半点毛病。他又钻到满是黑烟子的坏炉子里，挨个检查了炉砖的质量，也是无可指责。他想：“不能一条道跑到黑，难道炼钢工人的操作对炉衬寿命就无影响吗？”他打定了主意，就认真观察各小组炼钢工人的操作。
    “小许，咱们和别的小组在操作上一样吗？”王益元突然向助手许银生发问。
    “八仙过海，各有一套。”
    小许的话音刚落，王益元立即应了声：“对，问题就在这里。”
    下班后，王益元在小组会上提出：“咱们各个炼钢小组，产量、质量、消耗都有指标，就是炉衬寿命没有指标，所以大家在这上头就不大动脑筋，加上各组轮班混用一座炉子，操作不一致，怎么会不影响炉衬寿命呢？”大家一听都觉得有道理。王益元建议“咱们小组分为日夜三班，包一个炉，连班操作，一炼到底，看看究竟能炼多少炉钢。”他的建议得到了大家一致的支持。
    5月6日，“包炉炼钢”的试验开始了。铁水装进炉里，一助手刚一接风闸鼓风，炉口就冒出黑红色的火焰，不断喷溅着铁粒。凭经验，王益元知道这是装多了铁水而造成的消化不良。他当机立断，立刻调来铁水包倒出了六百多斤过盛的铁水，并且向工人们解释说：
  “铁水装得过多，吹炼角度大，风眼很快被腐蚀，炉衬寿命就短了。咱们应该坚持铁水装得合适，用小角度、面吹的方法操作，来延长炉衬寿命。”
    偏偏好事多磨，扒碴后起样一分析，铁水含硫量超过规定一倍多。这时大家沉不住气了，目光都集中到王益元身上。现在最需要的是信心和毅力。王益元想到这里马上喊道：“加大风量，多扒一次碴，先治好高硫的病。”二次扒碴后，大家继续坚持小角度、面吹的操作方法，火焰逐渐白亮起来，钢样化验完全合格。出钢的钟声响了，三十四分钟炼出了第一炉钢。炼第二炉钢的时候，王益元指派三个助手专门担任炉外脱硫，结果只用三十分钟就炼成了。接着第三炉、第四炉……一气炼了三十炉，炉衬寿命提高了一倍多。后来他们与别的组协作，还创造了一连炼一百二十七炉的最高纪录。
    全厂轰动了，王益元也掩饰不住内心的高兴：到底使转炉由“短命”变成了“长寿”！
    但是创造对王益元说来是无止境的。在一次总结“包炉炼钢”的经验交流会上，党委书记李大朴提出：现在炉衬寿命提高了，缩短冶炼时间就成了当前增产的一个新关键。党委书记的话正说在王益元的心坎上。第二天一大早，他就找小组工人研究，大家认真出点子，找措施。但是算来算去，大家的建议还不能使冶炼时间缩短很多。
    “咱们少加石灰，减掉它一半的用量行不行？”王益元这个大胆的提法使大家一楞。过去人们一直认为转炉炼钢，必须多加石灰，生铁含硫量越高，所加的石灰就越多，加石灰已经成了脱硫的老规矩。王益元这个想法显然和这个常规不同。他根据平时的观察和体会，向大家解释说：“石灰在炉里要吸收大量的热才能熔化，石灰加得越多，炉温就越低，冶炼时间也就越长；要是少加石灰，冶炼时间不就能缩短吗？小组工人同意他的意见，细心研究出了少加石灰的技术措施。党委知道了，也立即支持他们试验。
    试验的时候，王益元首先作好了炉外脱硫。开炉以后，他根据铁水含硫情况，头批料只加了十公斤石灰，比往常少了一半以上，果然炉温很快上升，火焰红中透白。等到扒完最后一次碴，准备出钢的时候，钢样化验结果：脱硫效果很好，但是，含硫量还稍高。“出钢！”王益元边喊边抄起铁锨迅速往倾泻的钢水里加了两锨氧化铁皮，降低了钢水含硫量，使这炉钢的质量达到了规定标准，而冶炼时间缩短到了二十六分钟，石灰用量由过去一百六十公斤减少到八十公斤。
    王益元对这个成绩并不满意。当炼第二炉钢的时候，他又采用了留碴法和二、三批料匀在一起一次加入炉膛的办法，结果不仅石灰用量再减少了四十公斤，而且只用了二十分钟就炼出了一炉合格钢。
    炉子脾气越摸越透，紧跟着冶炼时间也一炉比一炉缩短，他们小组最后创造了十二分钟炼一炉钢的新纪录。
    王益元的炼钢先进经验，很快就在各兄弟小组中开花结果。因此，全厂的转炉寿命平均延长了一倍多，冶炼时间大大缩短，石灰用量普遍降低一半，钢的单位产量提高了40％以上。
