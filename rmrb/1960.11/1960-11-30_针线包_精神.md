    The "Needle and Thread Kit" Spirit
    Lei Shenghong

    "New for three years, old for three years, patching and mending for another three years." This is a proverb circulating among the people. In reality, a piece of clothing is often worn by the father and then given to the son, and then passed on to the grandson; the eldest wears it and then gives it to the second child, and it's more than just nine years.

    We have an instructor who bought a shirt in 1952. The long sleeves were worn out and altered into short sleeves, and when the short sleeves wore out, they were altered into a vest, which he still wears today. In the past, the old Red Army and the Eighth Route Army each had a needle and thread kit. When a wife sent her husband to join the army, she gave him a needle and thread kit, and relatives also made needle and thread kits to comfort the soldiers. During the most difficult times of the revolution, they made their own clothes and wore them, and when they were torn, they sewed them up and wore them like new. We carried needle and thread kits and welcomed the victory of the national liberation.

    Today, we need this spirit of thrift through patching and mending even more for construction. In the past, we carried "needle and thread kits" to make revolution. If today the people of the whole country engage in construction with the spirit of carrying needle and thread kits, wouldn't communism come even faster?

### “针线包”精神

    “针线包”精神
    雷声洪
    “新三年，旧三年，缝缝补补又三年。”这是流传在人民口头的一句谚语。实际上一件衣服，往往父亲穿了给儿子穿，儿子穿了再给孙子穿；老大穿了给老二穿，又何止穿九年呢。
    我们有一位指导员，1952年买的一件衬衣，长袖穿坏了改成短袖穿，短袖穿坏了又改成背心穿，一直穿到现在。过去的老红军，八路军一人都有一个针线包，妻子送丈夫参军时送一个针线包，亲人慰问战士时也做一个针线包。在革命最艰苦的时候自己做衣服自己穿，破了自己缝一缝又当新的穿。我们带着针线包，迎接了全国解放的胜利。
    今天我们搞建设就更需要这种缝缝补补的节约精神。过去我们带着“针线包”搞革命，今天要是全国人民都以带着针线包的精神搞建设，共产主义不是会来得更快吗？
