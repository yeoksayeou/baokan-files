Xinhua News Agency dispatches: US imperialists’ activities of provocation against socialist countries, aggression and expansion everywhere in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and intensifying tensions have been sternly condemned by public opinion in various countries.

    Soviet "Red Star" published a commentary
    Condemning the U.S. Navy for Provocations Against the Soviet Union
The Soviet "Red Star" published a long article by a commentator, commenting on the provocative activities of the U.S. Navy against the Soviet Union. The author wrote that the facts show that the U.S. ruling groups have not only not abandoned their aggressive actions against the Soviet Union, but are also preparing new provocations against the Soviet Union. The author pointed out that the U.S. command’s decision to recently dispatch the "George Washington" nuclear submarine with rocket devices to areas near the northern coast of the Soviet Union for activities is actually dangerous playing with fire.
The commentator wrote that in the vital areas leading to southern Soviet Union, in the Black Sea bay area and the eastern Mediterranean region, U.S. imperialism has not ceased its war threats. In recent months, these areas have frequently conducted military demonstrations in the form of exercises or "courtesy visits." The commentator wrote that due to the U.S.’s open military demonstrations on the southern border of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's national defense is in a state of military alert. The adventurers in the Pentagon have been warned that if they carry out aggressive activities, they will be resolutely repelled. However, the U.S. generals are unwilling to heed the warnings and are openly creating tensions. In the second half of October, large-scale NATO naval exercises were conducted in the Aegean Sea, with warships from the United States, Greece, and Italy participating in the exercises.
The commentator finally emphasized that those who conduct military demonstrations and wave weapons on the Soviet border should have known long ago that the Soviet Union is not afraid of any threats. Our armed forces are equipped with all modern weapons and are ready to give the aggressors a devastating counterattack at any time.

    Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary
    Condemning the United States for openly supporting the Lao traitorous group
The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 5th, condemning the U.S. imperialists' aggressive conspiracy against Laos.
The commentary pointed out that recently, under the pretext of continuing to provide "aid" to Laos, the United States has directly handed over a large amount of weapons and money to the Phoumi Nosavan group, which is splitting Laos and preparing to attack Vientiane. Obviously, the purpose of U.S. "aid" to Laos is to help those reactionaries who attack the Lao people, attack the Lao patriotic forces, and oppose the legal government of Laos. The commentary also exposed the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to carry out military aggression against Laos.
The commentary said that recently U.S. imperialism has also stepped up its sabotage activities in Laos, alienating the Lao patriotic forces, putting pressure on the Lao government, forcing the Lao government to compromise with the Phoumi Nosavan group, and creating difficulties for the Lao government in negotiating with the Lao Patriotic Front.

    Indian "Blitz" Weekly carries an article exposing
    The United States is Intensifying Trouble-Making in Indochina
A recent issue of the Indian "Blitz" Weekly published a dispatch from its correspondent in Saigon, saying that the United States is stepping up measures to bind South Vietnam to the chariot of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in order to stir up trouble in Indochina.
According to the statistics of this weekly's correspondent, from the signing of the Geneva Accords to June of this year, 634 batches of U.S. weapons and ammunition were shipped to South Vietnam; so far, the United States has established 56 military airports in this small area. The news also emphasized that the United States often transports war materials from these airports in order to provoke incidents against the neutralist government of Cambodia, and also provides weapons to Lao traitors, who mainly rely on Thailand externally, while the military base in South Vietnam is connected to Thailand, which is the nerve center of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military alliance.

    Indonesian "News" editorial pointed out
    The United States Intensifies Tensions in Asia and Promotes Colonialism Everywhere
The Indonesian "News" has recently published a series of editorials exposing the U.S. conspiracy to expand its aggressive bloc in Asia, intensify tensions in Asia, and condemn the United States for implementing colonial rule throughout the world, demanding the elimination of all colonial systems in Asia and the world.
In its editorial on the 3rd, "News" said that the "Southeast Asia League" jointly proposed by the Philippines and the Federation of Malaya is no different from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc. The editorial believes that the activities of this planned alliance cannot be limited to economic, technical, and cultural affairs, as it is said. The editorial reminded people that the Philippines, as one of the initiating countries, is a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and Thailand, the active supporter of this plan, is also a member of that group.
"News" published an editorial on the 5th, condemning the United States for implementing colonial rule throughout the world, and demanding the elimination of all colonial systems in Asia and the world.
In its editorial on the 5th, "News" pointed out that the United States has consistently supported other colonial countries with colonies in Asia. For example, on the Goa issue, it supported Portugal against India, and on the West Irian issue, it supported the Netherlands against Indonesia.

    Damascus "Al-Alam" carries an article exposing
    U.S. Spy Planes Collecting Intelligence Over the Middle East
The Damascus "Al-Alam" published an article saying that the U.S. military bases established in Turkey, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and other countries are used by the United States to conduct reconnaissance and collect intelligence in Middle Eastern countries. The newspaper pointed out that according to existing materials, U.S. aircraft stationed in Libyan territory are systematically collecting intelligence about surrounding Arab countries. The U.S. "U-2" aircraft stationed at the (Libyan) Wheelus Air Base are used for aerial photography.
"Al-Alam" then wrote that U.S. bombers carrying atomic bombs are stationed at this base, and these bombers regularly fly over the skies of Eastern countries with atomic bombs. The various reconnaissance flights conducted by U.S. aircraft over surrounding Arab countries and countries of the socialist camp are carried out under the instructions of U.S. intelligence agencies.

    Head of the Algerian Delegation Visiting Latin America
    Condemns the United States for Supporting the French War of Aggression Against Algeria
The head of the Algerian government delegation, Ben Youcef Ben Khedda, who is visiting Latin America, spoke to reporters at the Brazilian Press Association on the 4th about the situation of the Algerian people's struggle, and condemned the United States and NATO for supporting the French colonial war in Algeria.
Ben Khedda said that the West encouraged De Gaulle to continue the Algerian war, and NATO supplied him with weapons to fight against the Algerian people, while giving France diplomatic support and financial assistance. He pointed out, "The United States is particularly generous in this financial support."
Ben Khedda pointed out that after World War II, the French army opposed the liberation of the people of Asian and African countries, and attempted to achieve in Algeria the victory it had failed to achieve in Indochina. He emphasized that without U.S. support, France would not be able to continue the Algerian colonial war.

    Guatemalan Labor Party issued a statement
    Calling on the people to oppose U.S. aggressive policies
The Guatemalan Labor Party recently issued a statement calling on the people to launch a struggle against U.S. imperialism’s enslavement and plunder of Guatemala and turning the country into a base for aggression against Cuba, and to stop the dictatorial rule in Guatemala.
The statement said that Guatemala's sovereignty is being violated by foreign troops stationed on its territory, and its territory is rapidly being turned into a U.S. base, a fulcrum of the U.S. military system, a base for anti-Cuban activities, and a camp for training mercenaries and Batista elements. At the same time, the country's economy is being undermined, and its finances are being jeopardized by the heinous loans obtained by the government. The statement emphasized that all of this must be changed.
The statement condemned the current regime for declaring a state of emergency in Guatemala in order to promote dictatorial rule. The statement pointed out that the decree of the state of emergency was announced in the context of intensifying the implementation of the anti-Cuban aggression plan; the promulgation of this decree also reflects the government's fear of the people's opposition to the policy of repression and plunder. The statement called on the workers, peasants, students, industrialists, and people of other strata in Guatemala to launch a struggle to safeguard national dignity and prevent Guatemala from becoming a vassal of the U.S. military.

    美帝国主义是世界和平的头号敌人
    各国舆论严正谴责美国到处进行挑衅侵略加剧紧张局势
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美帝国主义者向社会主义国家进行挑衅，在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各地到处侵略扩张、加剧紧张局势的活动，遭到了世界各国公众舆论的严正谴责。
    苏联“红星报”发表评论
    谴责美国海军对苏联进行挑衅
    苏联“红星报”发表了署名“评论员”的长篇文章，评论美国海军对苏联的挑衅活动。作者写道，事实说明，美国统治集团不仅没有放弃对苏联的侵略行动，而且正在准备对苏联进行新的挑衅。作者指出，美国司令部决定在最近派遣“乔治·华盛顿号”有火箭装置的原子潜水艇到靠近苏联北部海岸的地区进行活动，这实际上是危险的玩火。
    “评论员”写道，在通往苏联南部的要冲、在黑海海湾地区和地中海东部地区，美帝国主义没有停止它的战争威胁。近几个月来，这些地区常常在演习或“礼节性访问”的形式下进行军事示威。“评论员”写道，由于美国在苏联南部边界的公开的军事示威，使得苏联国防处于军事戒备状态。已经警告了五角大楼的冒险家，如果他们进行侵略活动，他们将遭到坚决的回击。但是，美国将军们不愿意听取警告，公然制造紧张局势。10月下半月又在爱琴海进行了大规模的北大西洋公约组织的海军演习，美国、希腊、意大利的军舰参加了这次演习。
    “评论员”最后强调指出，那些在苏联边境进行军事示威和挥舞武器的人早就应该知道，苏联是不怕任何威胁的。我国的武装部队配备着一切现代化的武器，随时准备给侵略者以毁灭性的回击。
    越南“人民报”发表评论
    谴责美国公开支持老挝叛国集团
    越南“人民报”5日发表评论，谴责美帝国主义对老挝的侵略阴谋。
    评论指出，最近，美国借口继续给予老挝“援助”，把大量武器和金钱直接交给正在分裂老挝、准备进攻万象的富米·诺萨万集团。很明显，美国“援助”老挝的目的，是帮助那些进攻老挝人民、进攻老挝爱国力量和反对老挝合法政府的反动分子。评论还揭露了美帝国主义企图对老挝进行军事侵略的阴谋。
    评论说，最近美帝国主义还在老挝加强了破坏活动，离间老挝的爱国力量，向老挝政府施加压力，逼迫老挝政府同富米·诺萨万集团妥协，并且为老挝政府同老挝爱国战线党谈判制造困难。
    印度“闪电”周报载文揭露
    美国在印度支那加紧兴风作浪
    最近一期的印度“闪电”周报登载该报记者发自西贡的消息说，美国正在加紧采取措施，把越南南方绑在东南亚条约组织的战车上，以便在印度支那兴风作浪。
    根据这家周报记者的统计，从签订日内瓦协议到今年6月为止，有六百三十四批美国武器和弹药运到越南南方；到目前为止，美国在这块小地方建立了五十六个军用机场。消息还强调说，美国经常从这些机场运出战争物资以便挑起事端来反对柬埔寨的中立主义政府，并且还向老挝叛国分子提供武器，这些叛国分子在外部主要依靠是泰国，而越南南方的军事基地是同作为东南亚条约组织军事同盟神经中枢所在的泰国相联系的。
    印度尼西亚“新闻报”社论指出
    美国加剧亚洲紧张局势到处推行殖民主义
    印度尼西亚“新闻报”最近连续发表社论，揭发美国阴谋在亚洲扩大其侵略集团，加剧亚洲的紧张局势，并谴责美国在全世界实行殖民统治，要求在亚洲和全世界消灭一切殖民主义制度。
    “新闻报”在3日的社论中说，菲律宾和马来亚联合邦共同建议的“东南亚联盟”同东南亚条约组织军事集团毫无不同之处。社论认为，计划中的这个联盟的活动不可能像所说的那样，只限于经济、技术和文化事务。社论提醒人们注意，作为发起国之一的菲律宾是东南亚条约组织成员国，这个计划的积极支持者泰国也是那个集团的成员国。
    “新闻报”5日发表社论，谴责美国在全世界实行殖民主义统治，要求在亚洲和全世界消灭一切殖民主义制度。
    在5日的社论里，“新闻报”指出，美国一贯支持在亚洲有殖民地的其它殖民国家。例如，在果阿问题上，它支持葡萄牙反对印度，在西伊里安问题上，它支持荷兰反对印度尼西亚。
    大马士革“旗帜报”载文揭露
    美国间谍飞机在中东上空搜集情报
    大马士革“旗帜报”发表文章说，美国在土耳其、伊朗、利比亚、沙特阿拉伯等国建立的军事基地，是美国用来在中东国家进行侦察和搜集情报工作的。报纸指出：根据现有材料证明，驻扎在利比亚领土上的美国飞机正在有系统地搜集关于周围阿拉伯国家的情报。驻扎在（利比亚）惠勒斯空军基地的美国“U—2型”飞机是用来进行空中摄影的。
    “旗帜报”接着写道，在这个基地上驻扎着带有原子弹的美国轰炸机，这些轰炸机带着原子弹定期地在东方国家的上空飞行。美国飞机在周围的阿拉伯国家以及社会主义阵营国家上空所进行的各种侦察飞行，都是根据美国情报机构的指示进行的。
    访问拉丁美洲的阿尔及利亚代表团团长
    谴责美国支持法国侵阿战争
    正在拉丁美洲访问的阿尔及利亚政府代表团团长本·优素福·本赫达4日在巴西新闻协会会见记者时谈到阿尔及利亚人民斗争的情况，并谴责美国和北大西洋公约组织支持法国在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争。
    本赫达说，西方鼓励戴高乐继续进行阿尔及利亚战争，北大西洋公约组织供给他武器来同阿尔及利亚人民作战，同时给予法国以外交上的支持和财政上的资助。他指出，“在这种财政支持方面，美国特别大方。”
    本赫达指出，第二次世界大战之后，法国军队反对亚非国家人民的解放，妄图在阿尔及利亚取得它在印度支那没有能取得的胜利。他强调指出，如果没有美国支持，法国就不可能继续进行阿尔及利亚殖民战争。
    危地马拉劳动党发表声明
    号召人民反对美国侵略政策
    危地马拉劳动党最近发表声明，号召人民展开斗争，反对美帝国主义奴役、掠夺危地马拉和把这个国家变成侵略古巴的基地，并且制止危地马拉的独裁统治。
    声明说，危地马拉的主权受到驻扎在它的领土上的外国军队的侵犯，它的领土正在迅速变为美国的一个基地、美国军事体系的一个支点、一个反古巴活动的基地和训练雇佣兵以及巴蒂斯塔分子的营地。同时，这个国家的经济正在遭到破坏，它的财政受到政府取得的性质凶恶的贷款的危害。声明强调指出，必须改变所有这一切。
    声明谴责现政权为推行独裁统治而宣布危地马拉处于紧急状态。声明指出，紧急状态的法令是在加紧执行反古巴的侵略计划的情况下宣布的；这项法令的颁布同时反映了政府害怕人民对镇压和掠夺政策的反对。声明号召危地马拉的工人、农民、学生、工业家以及其它各阶层人民展开斗争，以维护民族尊严，不使危地马拉变成美国军人的附庸。
