Xinhua News Agency, 5th of November: According to TASS, New York, 4th of November: For provocative purposes, the US authorities have illegally arrested Melekh, a Soviet citizen working for a UN agency, and have already imprisoned him for a week. The clamor whipped up by the American yellow press shows that the purpose of this barbaric act by the US authorities is to create a Cold War atmosphere and stir up an anti-communist hysteria. Even American newspapers have had to admit that the "espionage" charges made by the Chicago court against Melekh in the indictment are unfounded.

The US judicial authorities are making every effort to obstruct the release on bail of the illegally arrested Soviet citizen, and their efforts have even developed into an ugly farce.

According to US law, the defendant can be released on bail. The bail set by the US judicial authorities for Melekh was $50,000.

On November 2nd, when officials from the Soviet Embassy went to court to pay the bail, court officials initially refused to see them, and later refused to accept the bail from the Soviet Embassy officials for various reasons.

On November 3rd, the court again refused to accept bail from Melekh's wife. She immediately protested this decision by the court officials. Prosecutor Gillespie tried every possible means to obstruct Melekh's release on bail. He said at one point that it was not allowed at all, and at another point demanded that the bail be increased to $100,000. Even Judge Winefield had to admit that the prosecutor's actions were illegal. He promised that if a person without diplomatic immunity paid $50,000 bail, Melekh could be released.

However, Melekh is still in custody because the hearing of the case did not end until late in the evening, and the official handling bail was no longer in court.

On November 9th, the Federal Court will hear another issue related to the provocative arrest of Melekh raised by the US authorities -- the forced transfer of Melekh from New York to Chicago.

    制造冷战气氛并掀起反共歇斯底里
    美当局非法逮捕苏联公民
    竟监禁在联合国工作的苏联人梅列赫并阻挠交保释放
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日讯：美国当局为了挑衅目的非法逮捕了联合国机构工作人员苏联公民梅列赫，并且已经把他监禁了一星期。美国黄色报纸掀起的叫嚣表明，美国当局这种野蛮行动目的是要制造冷战情绪和掀起一场反共歇斯底里。甚至美国报纸也不得不说，芝加哥法院在起诉书中对梅列赫提出的“间谍”罪名是毫无根据的。
    美国司法机关竭力阻挠被非法逮捕的苏联公民交保获释，他们的这种努力甚至发展成了一出丑恶的滑稽剧。
    根据美国的法律，被告可以交保获释。美国司法当局对梅列赫规定的保金是五万美元。
    11月2日苏联大使馆官员到法院交保金时，法院官员起初是拒而不见，后来又以各种理由拒绝接受苏联大使馆官员的保金。
    11月3日，法院再次拒绝接受梅列赫妻子的保金。她当即对法院官员的这一决定提出了抗议。检察官吉利斯皮千方百计阻挠梅列赫交保释放。他一会说这是根本不允许的，一会又要求把保金增加到十万美元。就连法官沃因菲尔德也不得不承认，检察官的做法是不合法的。他答应如果由一名没有外交豁免权的人交付五万美元保金，梅列赫可以得到释放。
    但是梅列赫仍然在押，因为案件审理到晚间才结束，当时办理保金的官员已不在法院。
    11月9日联邦法院将审理美国当局提出的与挑衅性地逮捕梅列赫有关的另一个问题——把梅列赫由纽约强制转移到芝加哥的问题。
