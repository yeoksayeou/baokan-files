    The Secretary Goes to the Mess Hall
    The Food is Hot and the Dishes are Fragrant
    I was originally the Party Branch Secretary of the production team, and recently I was transferred to the mess hall as an administrator. The long-standing problems in this mess hall were: the cooks couldn't accurately estimate the amount of food to prepare, sometimes too much, sometimes too little; the serving time was inconsistent, sometimes early, sometimes late; and the variety of dishes was limited. What to do? So, I started to focus on these four areas: First, I focused on planned grain usage and economical grain consumption. Every meal's grain usage is weighed to ensure each meal is accounted for, cleared daily, and settled every ten days. Second, I focused on the variety of dishes. I encouraged everyone to come up with ideas to change the dishes and rotate them while saving grain. Third, I focused on the mess hall's own production. Fourth, I strengthened the political and ideological education of the cooks.
    After taking the above measures, we saved two hundred and fifteen jin of grain in five days. The commune members were satisfied. They said, "Our mess hall has changed. The food we eat is hot and the dishes are fragrant."

    书记下食堂
    饭热菜又香
    我原来是生产队的党支部书记，最近下放到食堂里当管理员。这个食堂长期没有解决的问题是：做饭掌握不住数量，忽多忽少；开饭的时间忽早忽晚；饭菜花样单一。怎么办呢？我就开始抓这样四个环节：第一，抓计划用粮和节约用粮。每顿饭用粮过秤，做到一顿一算，一天一清，十天一结；第二，抓饭菜花样品种。发动大家出主意，在节约粮食的前提下，变换花样，调换着吃；第三，抓食堂家底生产；第四，加强对炊事人员的政治思想教育。
    采取了上面的措施以后，五天就节约了粮食二百一十五斤。社员满意了，他们说：“我们食堂变了样，吃得饭热菜又香。”
