Revisiting Beijing
By Pei Gongcheng, Head of the Vietnamese Science and Technology Delegation

	Ten years of pioneering, new people grow daily.
	Last year I bid farewell to Beijing, this year I revisit it.
	The trees on the boulevard are taller, the roads even wider.
	Vegetables are green beside the road, a lush, verdant sight.
	New buildings are just topping out, their towering shadows long.
	Autumn colors have not yet faded, evoking many thoughts.
	Children greet me with smiling faces, their gazes shining brightly.
	The future is like brocade, life infinitely beautiful.
	The clear sky stretches ten thousand miles, boundless and limitless.
	I am delighted to see the red sunset, its glow reflecting on their cheeks.
	Where is Papa? Working in the factory.
	Where is Mama? Busy teaching at school.
	The children's eyes are bright, my heart even happier,
	From your eyes, the future is limitless.
	Though our ages differ, young and old share the same feeling,
	Hand in hand, embracing each other, the sky is clear for ten thousand miles,
	I love these children, their eyes sparkling with light.

    重访北京
    越南科技代表团团长　裴公澄十载辟天地，新人日日长。去年别北京，今年又重访。林荫树更高，大路益宽广。路旁菜蔬绿，满目郁苍苍。新楼初复顶，巍然投影长。秋色未阑珊，引人多怀想。儿童笑脸迎，凝眸闪华光。前程似锦绣，生活美无量。长空碧万里，辽阔无止境。喜看晚霞红，双颊相辉映。爸爸在何方？劳动在工厂；妈妈在哪里？学校教书忙。儿童双眼亮，我心更欢畅，从你双眼中，未来正无量。年龄虽相殊，长幼一般情，携手复拥抱，长空万里晴，我爱此儿童，双眼闪光明。〔罗尔庄译〕
