Romita, chairman of the Printing Workers' Union, said: The whole of Latin America opposes US aid to Cuban counter-revolutionaries.

    Guanas, chairman of the National Student Union, said: No one is surprised by the unilateral measures taken by the United States to deal with Cuba, because this is the US government's consistent practice towards Latin America.

    Aguiluz said, "The Cuban Revolution is the greatest revolution in the history of our continent and the awakening of Latin America, and we must defend it even if we have to sacrifice our lives." He pointed out that imperialism is attacking the Cuban Revolution because it can no longer plunder Cuba's wealth.

    全国学生联合会主席古安纳斯说：没有人对美国为对付古巴而采取的单方面措施感到奇怪，因为这是美国政府对拉丁美洲的一贯的做法。他说：古巴革命依靠古巴人民，同时得到拉丁美洲各国人民的支持。他同时强烈抗议美国在关塔那摩基地进行军事演习。他最后说：“古巴有权在自由中生活”。
