Xinhua News Agency, Accra, November 24th: According to a report in yesterday's Ghanaian "Evening News," Ghanaian Chargé d'Affaires to the Congo, Welbeck, told reporters from the newspaper last night during a private meeting here: "The United States, France, and Britain, in collusion with Belgium, are actively supporting Congolese rebels through various means."
  Welbeck pointed out that the imperialists are seriously hindering the realization of peace in the Congo.
    According to reports, due to the instigation of U.S. imperialism, Welbeck was illegally declared "persona non grata" by the Congolese Mobutu rebel group and was forced to return to Ghana from Leopoldville on the afternoon of the 22nd. He already left Accra by plane yesterday morning to go to Bamako, the capital of the Republic of Mali, to report to Ghanaian President Nkrumah, who is conducting a state visit there.

    加纳驻刚果代办韦尔贝克
    指责美国破坏刚果和平
    新华社阿克拉24日电　据加纳“新闻晚报”昨天报道，加纳驻刚果大使馆代办韦尔贝克昨晚在这里单独接见这家报纸的记者时说：“美国、法国和英国同比利时勾结在一起，正在通过各种办法积极支持刚果叛乱分子。”
  韦尔贝克指出，帝国主义分子严重阻挠刚果实现和平。
    据报道，由于美帝国主义的策动，韦尔贝克被刚果蒙博托叛乱集团非法地宣布为“不受欢迎的人”，并被迫在22日下午从利奥波德维尔回到加纳。他已在昨天上午乘飞机离开阿克拉前往马里共和国首都巴马科，向正在那里进行国事访问的加纳总统恩克鲁玛汇报。
