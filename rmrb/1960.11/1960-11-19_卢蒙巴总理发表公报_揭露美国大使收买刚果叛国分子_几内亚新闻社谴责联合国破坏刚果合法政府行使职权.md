Xinhua News Agency, 18th - Leopoldville dispatch: Congolese Premier Lumumba issued a communiqué on the 17th, exposing the US Ambassador to the Congo’s despicable plot to bribe Congolese parliamentarians to subvert the legitimate Congolese government and split the Congo.

Lumumba stated that in August of this year, the US Ambassador to Leopoldville sent Gilbert Fataki, a member of parliament from the Eastern Province belonging to the Congolese National Movement, to the United States. After Fataki returned from the US, he, accompanied by other accomplices, returned to Stanleyville, the capital of Eastern Province. When they got off the plane, the local government found 30 million francs and some documents on them. Among these documents was a list of the secessionist "government" they intended to establish after launching a coup with the assistance of Colonel Lokosa (a reactionary military officer executing Mobutu's instructions in Stanleyville, now arrested).

Premier Lumumba further stated that among the confiscated documents was a telegram sent from New York to Fataki, instructing him to collect money from the Bank of Brazzaville in the (formerly French) Congo.

In the communiqué, Lumumba pointed out that the confiscated 30 million francs were actually given by the Americans.

At the same time, to demonstrate their "strength" and intimidate the Congolese people, the Mobutu rebel group, supported by the imperialists, held a military parade in Leopoldville on the 17th. According to reports, UN Acting Special Representative Likiye and "UN Force" Commander Van Horn actually led a group of UN officials and stood on the reviewing stand with Mobutu to review the reactionary troops controlled by Mobutu.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, 15th - The Guinean Press Agency published an editorial on the 12th condemning the imperialist conspiracy to invade the Congo, calling on the people of African countries to be vigilant and continue the struggle to smash the imperialist conspiracy to further undermine Congolese independence.

The editorial, entitled "New Attempts in the Congo," stated, "After exhausting all means in an attempt to turn the Congo back into a colony, Western imperialists this week tried to have Kasavubu reappear, not in the Congo, but in the highest UN body. Kasavubu dared to presumptuously claim to be the trustee of the wishes and will of the Congolese people at the UN. This confirms that the planners of the Congo affair—whether UN personnel stationed in the Congo or UN personnel stationed in New York—are acting according to a meticulously planned plan. What indicates this first is Hammarskjöld's report to the UN member states on the current situation in the Congo."

The editorial stated that the situation in the Congo has not improved but has worsened. Hammarskjöld insisted in his report that "in the current chaotic situation in [the Congo], the two institutions that still have a basis are the office of the head of state and the parliament." The editorial stated, "To put it clearly, this implicitly means that there is no government in the Congo. People have the right to ask Hammarskjöld, what about the government of Leopoldville?" The editorial solemnly pointed out that before the UN delegation arrived in the Congo, there was a government in the Congo, that is, the legally established government headed by Premier Lumumba. The editorial said that, in fact, the UN authorities were ordered to make it impossible for this government to exercise its functions throughout the country.

The editorial also pointed out that it is noteworthy that the US representative, following the consistently unchanging policy since the Congo incident, has exhausted all means to undermine the united front formed by all Asian and African countries to block the path of deception.

    卢蒙巴总理发表公报
    揭露美国大使收买刚果叛国分子
    几内亚新闻社谴责联合国破坏刚果合法政府行使职权
    新华社18日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴17日发表公报，揭露美国驻刚果大使从事收买刚果议员阴谋颠覆刚果合法政府和分裂刚果的卑鄙勾当。
    卢蒙巴说，今年8月，美国驻利奥波德维尔大使把东方省刚果民族运动党议员吉耳培·法塔基送往美国。法塔基从美国回来后，在其他一些同谋者的陪同下，回到东方省省会斯坦利维尔。在他们下飞机的时候，当地政府在他们身上查出了三千万法郎和一些文件。在这些文件中，有他们企图在洛科沙上校（在斯坦利维尔执行蒙博托指示的反动军官，现在已被逮捕）的协助下发动政变后建立的分裂“政府”的名单。
    卢蒙巴总理又说，在查获的这些文件中，有一份从纽约发给法塔基的电报，叫他到刚果（前法属）布拉柴维尔银行取钱。
    卢蒙巴在公报中指出，查出的三千万法郎实际上是由美国人给的。
    在这同时，帝国主义者支持下的蒙博托叛乱集团为了显示“力量”，恫吓刚果人民，17日在利奥波德维尔举行了军事检阅。消息说，联合国代理特派代表里克耶和“联合国军”司令范霍恩竟率领一批联合国官员和蒙博托一起站在检阅台上检阅蒙博托控制的反动军队。
    据新华社科纳克里15日电　几内亚新闻社12日发表社论谴责帝国主义侵略刚果的阴谋，号召非洲各国人民提高警惕，继续进行斗争来粉碎帝国主义进一步破坏刚果独立的阴谋。
    这篇题为“在刚果的新尝试”的社论说，
  “在想尽办法企图把刚果重新变成殖民地之后，西方帝国主义者本周试图叫卡萨武布重新粉墨登场，不是在刚果，而是在联合国最高机构中。卡萨武布竟然妄自在联合国以刚果人民的愿望和意愿的受托者自居。这就证实了：刚果事件的策划人——不论是派驻刚果的联合国人士还是常驻纽约的联合国人士，都是按照一项事先周密部署好的计划行事的。首先表明这一点的是哈马舍尔德亲自向联合国会员国提出的关于刚果目前局势的报告”。
    社论说，刚果局势非但没有改善，反而恶化了。哈马舍尔德在他的报告中硬说：“在目前存在于（刚果）的混乱局势中，其基础还存在着的两个机构是国家元首职务和议会”。社论说，“说得清楚一些，这是不言而喻地意味着在刚果没有政府存在。人们有权请问哈马舍尔德，利奥波德维尔政府怎么样了呢？”社论严正指出，在联合国的代表团到达刚果之前，刚果是存在着政府的，那就是依法建立起来的以卢蒙巴总理为首的政府。社论说，然而，在事实上，联合国当局奉命使这个政府不可能行使全国范围的职能。
    社论还指出，值得注意的是，美国代表遵循自从刚果发生事件以来一贯不变的方针，想尽一切办法来破坏全体亚非国家为了堵塞欺骗的道路而结成的统一阵线。
