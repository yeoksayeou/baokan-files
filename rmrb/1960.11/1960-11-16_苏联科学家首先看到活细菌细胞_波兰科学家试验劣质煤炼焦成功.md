    Soviet Scientists First to See Living Bacterial Cells
    Polish Scientists Successfully Experiment with Coking Inferior Coal
    Soviet scientists have built a gas microscope chamber. They used this device in conjunction with an electron microscope to see living bacterial cells for the first time.
    In the past, the scientific community has used electron microscopes to observe bacterial cells. However, during the preparation of specimens and under the effect of the electron beam in the rarefied air of the electron microscope, all organisms die, so only dead bacterial cells can be seen. In the gas microscope chamber, normal atmospheric pressure is maintained, and the electron beam does not have a fatal effect on the microorganisms inside.
    Currently, they have observed the growth of bacterial cells, their interactions, and the formation of bacterial aggregates. They also discovered that certain particles appear in these aggregates, and these particles can also turn into bacterial cells.
    This device can also be used to observe many kinds of chemical reactions between solids and gases, which was previously impossible.
    The Polish Coal Processing Chemical Research Institute has successfully experimented with using inferior coal to produce coke.
    Coke is essential for blast furnace ironmaking and is generally produced from specialized coking coal. Although Poland has a high coal output, it has long relied on expensive imported coke for ironmaking due to a lack of this high-quality coal. The success of this research makes it possible for Poland to stop importing coke.
    The results of the institute's experiments show that any type of coal can be used for coking by adopting various different technological methods. Poland has now begun large-scale production of coke using secondary coal. The cost of producing coke blocks using this method is lower than that of coke produced by general methods.

    苏联科学家首先看到活细菌细胞
    波兰科学家试验劣质煤炼焦成功
    苏联科学家建造了气体显微室，他们用这种装置同电子显微镜配合使用，第一次看到了活的细菌细胞。
    过去科学界一直是利用电子显微镜来观察细菌细胞的。但在制剂制作过程中以及在电子显微镜空气稀薄空间中电子束的作用下，一切生物都会死掉，因此只能看到死的细菌细胞。而在气体显微室中保持着正常的大气压，电子束对其中的微生物不致有致命的影响。
    目前他们已经看到了细菌细胞的生长、相互影响以及细菌积聚的形成。他们还发现，在这些积聚中出现某些微粒，这些微粒也会变成细菌细胞。
    利用这种装置还可以看到固体同气体间的许多种化学反应情况，而这也是早先做不到的。
    波兰煤炭加工化学研究所试验利用劣质煤制取焦炭已经获得成功。
    焦炭是高炉炼铁所必需的，一般要用专门的炼焦用煤来炼制。波兰煤的产量虽然很高，但由于缺少这种优质煤，长期以来一直要依靠昂贵的进口焦炭来炼铁。这项研究获得成功就使得波兰有可能停止焦炭进口。
    这个研究所进行试验的结果表明，采用各种不同的工艺方法，任何一种煤都可以用来炼焦。目前波兰已经开始大规模利用次级煤生产焦炭。利用这种方法生产焦炭块的成本，比用一般方法生产的焦炭还要低。
