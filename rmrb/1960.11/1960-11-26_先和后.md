    First and Then
    Xue Wen
    Wan Xianqun, a cadre from Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, who was sent to work at the grassroots level, insisted on learning from grassroots cadres and commune members in everything and at all times. This vigorously promoted production and was warmly praised by the masses.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Only by being students of the masses can we be teachers of the masses." Wan Xianqun initially acted as a teacher of the masses and almost ruined things. Later, he changed and became a student first. As a result, things were done very well. This shows that "first" and "then" are not a matter of procedure, but a matter of substance. It seems that there is only a one-word difference between "first" and "then", but in reality, the difference is significant. The masses are the real heroes, while individual wisdom is limited. Wan Xianqun's handling of the more than thirty mu of land in the team that suffered from severe drought is a case in point. He thought that the method he proposed would be better than that of the masses. As a result, to his surprise, the masses put forward a very practical solution. In particular, he greatly underestimated the soaring enthusiasm of the masses. This was also a great education for him. Therefore, those who truly have the spirit of being students of the masses must resolutely and thoroughly believe in the collective wisdom of the masses and rely on the strength of the masses. When this is achieved, one will surely be a good teacher of the masses. Why? Because you have already learned from the masses, and what you teach the masses is a process of "from the masses, to the masses." This is the true teacher of the masses.
    Some people say: Lower-level cadres are not familiar with the situation at the beginning, so they need to be students first. When they are familiar with the situation, they can be teachers first and students later. But this is not the case. If you don't be a student first, the familiarity will slowly become unfamiliarity, and understanding will become ignorance. The practical struggle of the masses is constantly developing. Today, the cadres learn from the masses, and tomorrow, the masses will gain new knowledge and experience in new practices. Any cadre who learns the best from the masses, as long as he is satisfied with this step and stops, will not be able to keep up with the new situation. Especially in the current nationwide upsurge of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, a large number of new things, new experiences, new creations and new problems are being generated every day in the forefront of agriculture. Every lower-level cadre should closely integrate with reality, first learn from the masses, and continue to learn from the masses. Wan Xianqun's approach of asking "three olds" (old cadres, old farmers, old commune members) for advice, holding regular old farmers' meetings, frequently visiting commune members, and making one or two close friends in the team to establish a system of learning from the masses first when encountering problems, is a valuable experience. From being a student to being a teacher, from being a student again to being a teacher again, this is a law. Only by mastering this law can a lower-level cadre always stand in front of the masses and lead the masses forward.
    At present, lower-level cadres in various places attach great importance to learning from grassroots cadres and commune members, but how to truly learn well can be inspired by Wan Xianqun's deeds.

    先和后
    学文
    江西南昌县下放干部万贤群，坚持事事、时时先向基层干部和社员群众学习，有力地推动了生产，受到广大群众的热烈赞扬。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”。万贤群开始先当了群众的先生，差一点把事情办坏了。以后他改变了，先当学生，结果，事情办得十分出色。由此可见，先和后，不是一个程序问题，而是一个实质问题。看起来，先和后只有一字之差，实际上，差别很大。群众是真正的英雄，而个人智慧是有限的。万贤群对待队里三十多亩发生了严重旱象的田，就是一例。他以为他提出的办法会比群众的高明。结果，出乎他的意料之外，群众提出了非常切合实际的办法。特别是对群众的冲天干劲，他估计很不够。这对他实际上也是一个很大的教育。所以，真正具有先做群众学生精神的人，必须坚决彻底地相信群众的集体智慧，依靠群众的力量。做到了这一步，再去当群众的先生，一定能当得好。为什么呢？因为你已经向群众学到了东西，你教给群众的东西，是经过“从群众中来，到群众中去”的过程。这才是群众的真正先生。
    有人说：下放干部刚开始情况不熟，需要先当学生，等到熟悉了情况，就可以先当先生、后当学生了。其实不然，如果不先当学生，慢慢地熟悉的变成了不熟悉，懂得的变成不懂了。群众的实践斗争，是不断发展的，干部今天向群众学到了东西，明天，群众在新的实践中又获得新的知识和经验。任何一个向群众学得最好的干部，只要他在这一步上感到满足，停住了脚，都不能跟上新的形势。特别是在当前全国大办农业、大办粮食的运动热潮中，在农业第一线，每天每时都在产生大量的新事物、新经验、新创造和新问题，每个下放干部更应密切结合实际，先向群众学习，并且不断向群众学习。万贤群，所采取的请教“三老”（老干部、老农、老社员），定期召开老农会，经常访问社员和在小队交一二知心朋友等一套办法，把遇事先向群众学习制度化，是一个宝贵的经验。由做学生到做先生，由再做学生到再做先生，这是一个规律，一个下放干部，只有掌握住这个规律，才能永远站在群众的前面领导群众前进。
    目前，各地下放干部都很重视向基层干部和社员群众学习，但是如何真正学得好，从万贤群的事迹中可以得到宝贵的启示。
