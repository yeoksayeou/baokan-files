    Weapons Made of Railroad Tracks
    During the Anti-Japanese War, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which persisted in resisting Japan, grew stronger in frequent battles against the enemy. Relying solely on weapons and ammunition seized from the enemy was far from enough, and just like solving the problem of food and clothing, we had to build our own ordnance factories and repair shops in the enemy's rear rural areas to solve the problem of supplying weapons and equipment and ammunition. But manufacturing weapons was not a simple matter; at that time, we didn't even have a pair of pliers. But we relied on our own two hands, starting from scratch, establishing simple ordnance factories, overcoming numerous difficulties, and finally made our own weapons and ammunition.
    The "79" rifle, made by our army during the Anti-Japanese War and displayed in the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, was made by the border region ordnance factory from enemy railroad tracks that had been seized.
    This self-made weapon played a great role in our persistence in the Anti-Japanese War behind enemy lines, and ultimate victory.

    铁轨做的武器
    在抗日战争时期，坚持抗战的八路军和新四军在频繁的对敌作战中，日益成长壮大。仅仅依靠从敌人手中夺来的武器和弹药已经远远不够需要，这也得和解决衣食问题一样，要自己动手在敌后农村建立自己的兵工厂和修械所，只有这样才能解决武器装备与弹药的供应问题。但是制造武器并不是一件简单的事，当时连一把老虎钳子都没有。可是我们就凭两只手，白手起家，建立起简陋的兵工厂，克服了重重困难，终于自己造出了武器弹药。
    陈列在中国人民革命军事博物馆的抗日战争时期我军自己制造的“七九”步枪，就是边区兵工厂用缴获敌人的铁轨制成的。
    这种自制的武器，对我坚持敌后抗日战争取得最后胜利起了很大的作用。
