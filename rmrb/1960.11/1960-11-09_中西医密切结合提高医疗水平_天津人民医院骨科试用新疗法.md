Close Combination of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine to Improve Medical Standards
Tianjin People's Hospital Tries New Therapies

(Our report) Tianjin People's Hospital's Western medicine practitioners earnestly learn from traditional Chinese medicine, using modern medical scientific knowledge to comprehensively analyze and improve the medical expertise of the hospital's internal and external traditional Chinese medicine orthopedists, laying a good foundation for creating new orthopedic therapies.

This hospital focuses on orthopedics, and it has concentrated experienced Western medicine orthopedists from the city. Since 1958, the hospital's traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners have closely cooperated to research the experience of traditional Chinese medicine massage in treating lumbar disc herniation and local bandaging and fixation in treating wrist fractures and humeral shaft fractures, and have made achievements in clinical treatment. Since this spring, in order to make up for the shortcomings of learning traditional Chinese medicine, which was originally limited to one teacher and one apprentice, one prescription and one dose, the hospital's Western medicine practitioners have broken out of the circle of only learning from the hospital's traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. They actively consulted experienced old traditional Chinese medicine orthopedists from various hospitals and clinics in Tianjin, learning their specialties in bone setting, massage, and bandaging fixation, and invited these old traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to give clinical demonstrations. Some experienced Western medicine practitioners also took these old traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as their teachers, following them to learn. Tao Fu, deputy director of orthopedics with more than 20 years of medical experience, established a teacher-student relationship with Ye Xixian, director of orthopedics at the Tianjin College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital, teaching and learning from each other. Western medicine practitioners from the People's Hospital also visited wise men and sought teachers in other places, learning more broadly from the rich experience of old traditional Chinese medicine practitioners.

The hospital's Western medicine practitioners, mainly directors and attending physicians, established three special topic groups: trauma, comprehensive therapy, and experimentation. Under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine, they specialized in sorting out and improving the clinical experience of various old traditional Chinese medicine orthopedists. Associate Chief Physician Li Ruizong, Attending Physician Zhang Keqin, Lan Wenzheng, and others, based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and the results of meridian detection of one hundred and seventy-eight cases of simple fracture patients, preliminarily affirmed the role of the liver and kidney in fracture repair. Medical personnel also measured the firmness of Chinese medicine and external application medicine on orthopedic healing through X-ray examination, animal specimen tensile testing, and other methods. At the same time, according to the anatomical principles of modern medicine, they analyzed the massage techniques and locations of traditional Chinese medicine. The research results of the special topic groups provided convenient conditions for the hospital's orthopedic Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to develop new types of therapies. In the past, the curative effect of traditional Chinese and Western medicine in treating ankle fractures was not high. This time, Shang Tianyu, deputy director of orthopedics, absorbed the experience of the old traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Zhang Xiaoqian in using wooden board fixation and the old traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Feng Xianchi from Cangxian in using bamboo skin fixation to treat lower limb fractures, changing the original method of using only straight splints for fixation in traditional Chinese medicine to using specially made splints to fix the fracture site according to the type of fracture. In this way, not only is the fracture well aligned and healed quickly, but the joints can also move as usual, and the entire course of treatment is shortened from an average of eight weeks in the past to four weeks.

The medical personnel of the People's Hospital also actively strive for external help and widely solicit opinions from patients in order to gather wisdom and jointly improve the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. They invited students from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class and students from the Tianjin College of Traditional Chinese Medicine to work in the hospital for a short period of time to help them analyze the clinical efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine using the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. At the same time, they also continuously solicited patients' opinions on the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine through seminars, individual conversations, and other methods.

    中西医密切结合提高医疗水平
    天津人民医院骨科试用新疗法
    本报讯　天津市人民医院西医认真向中医学习，用现代医学科学知识综合分析提高院内、外骨科中医的医疗特长，为创造骨科新疗法奠定了良好基础。
    这所医院以骨科为主，院内集中了全市有经验的骨科西医。1958年以来，这个医院的中西医就密切合作，对中医按摩治疗腰椎间盘突出症、局部包扎固定治疗手腕骨折和肱骨干骨折的经验进行了研究，并在临床治疗方面作出了成绩。今春以来，这个医院的西医为了弥补原来学习中医仅限于一师一徒、一方一剂的不足，跳出了只向本院中医学习的圈子，积极向天津市各医院、门诊部的骨科老中医请教，学习他们在整复、按摩、包扎固定等方面的特长，并请这些老中医做临床示范。一些有经验的西医还拜这些老中医为师，跟班学习。有二十多年医疗经验的骨科副主任陶甫就和天津中医学院附属医院骨科主任叶希贤建立了师徒关系，互教互学。人民医院的西医还到外地访贤求师，更广泛地学习老中医的丰富经验。
    这个医院的西医以主任、主治医师为主，建立了创伤、综合疗法、实验三个专题小组，在中医指导下，专门整理提高各骨科老中医的临床经验。副主任医师李瑞宗、主治医师张克勤、兰文正等人，根据祖国医学理论，和对一百七十八例单纯骨折病人经络探测的结果，初步肯定了肝、肾对骨折修复的作用。医务人员还通过Ｘ光检查、动物标本拉力试验等方法，测定中药和外敷药对骨科愈合的坚强度，同时根据现代医学的解剖原理，对中医的按摩手法、部位进行了分析。专题小组的研究结果，为全院骨科中、西医开展新型疗法，提供了便利条件。过去中西医治疗脚腕部骨折的疗效不高，这次，骨科副主任尚天裕吸取了老中医张筱谦用木板固定方法和沧县老中医冯咸池用竹皮固定方法医治下肢骨折的经验，将原来中医只用直型夹板固定的方法，改为针对骨折类型，用特制的夹板固定骨折部位，这样，不但骨折对位好，愈合快，而且关节还能照常活动，全部疗程平均由过去八周缩短为四周。
    人民医院的医务人员还积极争取外界帮助，广泛征求病人意见，以做到集思广益，共同提高祖国医学遗产。他们请中医研究班的学员和天津中医学院的学生到医院短期工作，帮助他们用祖国医学理论分析中医临床疗效。同时，还通过座谈会、个别交谈等方式，不断征求病人对中西医结合疗法的意见。　（虞锡銈）
