    Lights of Ciping
    Yuan Ying
    After dusk, as the last glimmer of the setting sun fades behind the peaks, the electric lights of Ciping shine together.

    Whenever the people of Jinggangshan speak of the new look of this mountain town surrounded by mountains, they always do so with special excitement and in a particularly enthusiastic tone. People compare it to the brightest star in the sky, the most splendid flower among myriad colors. Such comparisons are not at all excessive, and perhaps it feels especially intimate and deeply felt at night.

    At this moment, we stand before a small hill. Facing us is a patch of dark sky, and the surrounding peaks of Ciping are not even visible in outline. However, the electric lights, one after another, patch after patch, form a brilliant ring of light, making the stars in the sky pale in comparison. This is Ciping. Don't say you can't see anything in the dark; just with these patches of light, can't we vaguely discern where they come from?

    There is the office building of the Party Committee and the Administrative Bureau. Perhaps the leaders and cadres of Jinggangshan are discussing the arrangements for autumn harvest and winter planting, perhaps they are formulating plans for winter bamboo and timber felling, or perhaps they are engrossed in studying Volume IV of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The long-distance bus station and the post and telecommunications bureau are neighbors. The night shift workers are busy connecting Jinggangshan with all directions. Drivers are checking vehicles, and postal workers are bundling newly received newspapers, magazines, and letters from afar, preparing to send them to the reclamation farms, branches, and communes early tomorrow morning. The lights at the Jinggangshan Mansion and the department store construction site are on all night. People brave the autumn wind and rain, adding stacks of bricks and tiles, and pieces of lumber, upwards. The "old revolutionaries" in the nursing home are perhaps again telling stories under the lamp about how Chairman Mao led the troops down the mountain to carry grain in those years. In the classrooms of Jinggangshan Elementary School, the children who come to school for evening self-study are concentrating on reviewing their lessons. In the hospital, nurses may be smiling and giving a warm bath to another newly born descendant of Jinggangshan, happily praising in a low voice, "Look how chubby he is!" Every room in the guesthouse is full of people. Some have come from thousands of miles away to seek experience and treasure in this world-famous mountain, some have brought machines, parts, and the enthusiasm of people from afar to support the construction of the mountainous area, and some have brought new experiences and achievements to participate in meetings...

    Bright, brilliant lights of Ciping, is each of your lights the beating, hot heart of the people of Jinggangshan? When people are working, laboring, studying, resting, and staring intently at the electric lights in front of them, what are you thinking about? The old folks and veteran cadres of the old revolutionary base area will recall the long, long nights when there were never any electric lights on Jinggangshan. For generations, people burned bamboo strips for lighting, and at best, it was a tea oil lamp. The cadres who were sent to work here, the demobilized soldiers, and the young people from other places will remember Ciping when they first came to the mountains three years ago, recall the snowy nights when they went deep into the mountains to cut thatch bamboo to build houses to live in, and recall the intense battle to build the Shishikou Hydropower Station. Yes, it is the people of Jinggangshan who, under the guidance of the Party, used their own hands to generate electricity with water, to bring electricity to the mountains; it is they themselves who laid the granite from Jinggangshan, cut down the thatch bamboo and fir trees from Jinggangshan, and built factories and new buildings, making Ciping more radiant, magnificent, and moving day by day.

    The bright, brilliant lights of Ciping remind me of a story a general once told: Thirty years ago, when Comrade Mao Zedong led the troops to Jinggangshan, because lamp oil was very scarce, he personally stipulated that only one lamp with three wicks was allowed to be lit during office hours, and when not working, the lamp had to be extinguished. Each company headquarters kept one lamp on for duty and sentries, but only one wick could be used.

    Ah, we seem to see those oil lamps. The thatched huts cannot withstand the wind and rain, and the faint flame on the wick is flickering. Under an oil lamp, Red Army commanders are deploying new battles and studying newly delivered intelligence about the activities of the White bandits; under an oil lamp, Red Army soldiers are holding accusation meetings, and a captured soldier is accusing the landlords and despots of how they ruined his family; under an oil lamp, the quartermaster is calculating the five cents of oil, salt, and vegetable money per person per day, figuring out how to get some salt; under an oil lamp, the leader of the Red Guards is patrolling the rugged mountain paths to check the sentries... Isn't the site of the former Suichuan County Soviet Government precisely on this small hill where we are standing now? Wasn't it also under an oil lamp that the members of the County Soviet Government were enthusiastically studying the work of distributing land and fighting local tyrants?

    Comrades who fought, worked, and studied under the oil lamps of Jinggangshan, do you still remember what Ciping looked like back then? When you gathered around an oil lamp and talked about the future, did you perhaps talk about the day when the lights of Ciping would shine as bright as day? Thirty years of wind and rain have passed, thirty years of swords and shadows have passed, and in the place where Comrade Mao Zedong once lived, in the place where you once shed blood and sweat, your next generation is realizing your ideals of those years. In the place where one wick was lit, tens of thousands of electric lights have been lit.

    It is said that on the day the hydropower station generated electricity last year on National Day, the old people in the nursing home stood excitedly in front of the electric lights, gazing at them, discussing them, and tears could not help but well up in their eyes. One old man said: In the past, when the Red Army was in Jinggangshan, they promoted that the future society would be Soviet power plus electrification. At that time, I didn't understand it yet, but now, I understand it a little.

    Old people, the electrification of Jinggangshan has not yet been fully realized. The people of Jinggangshan are carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of lighting one wick thirty years ago, and are building diligently. They want to make the water of Jinggangshan generate more electricity, to make electricity drive more machines, and to illuminate more homes.

    In the large ring of lights in Ciping, the brightest are two strings of pearl-like light chains hanging down from the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Tower. The memorial tower stands on the top of the mountain, and these two strings of light chains can be seen from all over Ciping. People say they are like the eyes of the revolutionary martyrs, watching Jinggangshan day and night. What a good metaphor! Now, they are as clear and bright as the eyes of the revolutionary martyrs, piercing and spirited, gazing deeply at this large expanse of Ciping lights, guarding the bustling night of Jinggangshan.

    茨坪灯火
    袁鹰
    黄昏过后，当夕阳的一点余辉在山峰后隐隐消逝的时候，茨坪的电灯便一齐亮了。
    井冈山人每次在说到这座群山环抱中的山城新貌的时候，总是怀着特别激动的心情，用着特别兴奋的语调。人们把它比作满天繁星中最明亮的一颗，万紫千红中最绚丽的一朵。这样的比拟，一点也不过分，也许在夜晚会感觉它分外亲切，体会也分外深刻些。
    此刻，我们站在一座小山坡前。面前的一片黑黝黝的天空，茨坪周围的峰峦，连轮廓也看不清。但是，电灯光却是一个接一个、一片连一片，结成了一圈灿烂的大灯环，使天上星斗也黯然失色。这就是茨坪。你别说黑夜里瞧不到什么，光凭这一片片灯火，我们不是可以依稀辨认出它们是从哪里发出来的么？
    那里是党委会和管理局的办公大楼，井冈山的领导者们和干部们也许正在讨论秋收冬种的安排，也许正在制订冬季砍伐竹木的计划，也许正在全神贯注地学习《毛泽东选集》第四卷。长途汽车站和邮电局是邻居，夜班职工们正忙着把井冈山同四面八方联结起来，司机在检查车辆，邮务员把新收到的报纸杂志和远方来信捆在包里，准备明天一早送到垦殖场分场和公社去。井冈山大厦和百货大楼工地的灯光，彻夜不熄，人们冒着秋夜的风雨，把一叠叠砖瓦，一根根木料，往上加添。敬老院的“老革命”们，也许又在灯下为后辈们讲述毛委员当年怎样带着队伍下山挑粮的故事。井冈山小学的教室里，到学校来上夜自修的孩子们，正在专心一意地温习功课。医院里，护士们也许正在微笑地为又一个刚出世的井冈山后代洗温水澡，高兴地小声赞赏：“瞧，他有多胖！”招待所的每一间屋子都住满了人，他们有的不远千里而来，到这天下名山来求经取宝，有的带着机器、零件、带着远方人的一片热情来支援山区建设，有的带着新的经验和成就来参加会议……
    明亮的、灿烂的茨坪灯火，你的每一盏灯光，就是井冈山人的一颗跳动的、灼热的心吧？当人们在劳动、工作和学习、休憩的时间，对着面前的电灯凝神的时候，你们想到什么呢？老俵们、老苏区干部们会想起那漫漫的长夜，井冈山上从来没有过电灯，世世代代都是烧一根竹片来照明，最好的时候也是一盏茶油灯。下放干部、转业军人和外地青年们，会想起三年前刚上山时候的茨坪，想起到深山里砍茅竹来盖房子住的风雪夜，想起石狮口修水电站的紧张的战斗。是的，正是井冈山人，按着党的指引，用自己的双手叫水发电，叫电上山的；正是他们自己砌上井冈山的花岗石，砍下井冈山的茅竹和杉树，盖起一座座工厂和新楼，使茨坪一天天更加光耀夺目，雄伟动人。
    明亮的、灿烂的茨坪灯火，使我想起一位将军说过的一件往事：三十年前，毛泽东同志带着部队上井冈山的时候，由于灯油十分艰难，曾经亲自规定过：办公时只准点一盏灯，三根灯芯，不办公时，灯就得熄掉，每个连部留一盏灯带班查哨，但是只能用一根灯芯。
    啊，我们仿佛看到那一盏盏油灯了。茅草屋挡不住风雨，灯芯上微弱的火焰在抖动着。在一盏油灯下，红军指挥员们正在部署新的战役，研究刚送来的有关白匪军活动的情报；在一盏油灯下，红军战士们正在开控诉会，一个俘虏兵正在控诉地主恶霸怎样搞得他家破人亡；在一盏油灯下，司务长正在结算每人每天五分钱的油盐菜金，在划算着怎么去搞点盐；在一盏油灯下，赤卫队长踏着崎岖的山径去查哨；……就在我们现在站立的这座小山坡上，不正是当年遂川县苏维埃政府的旧址么？不也正是在一盏油灯下，县苏维埃政府的委员们在热烈地研究分田地、打土豪的工作么？
    在井冈山的油灯下战斗过、工作过、学习过的同志们，你们还记得当年茨坪是个什么样子吗？当你们围着一盏油灯畅谈未来的时候，也许谈到过一定有那么一天，茨坪的灯火会照耀得如同白昼吗？风风雨雨的三十年过去了，刀光血影的三十年过去了，就在毛泽东同志当年住过的地方，就在你们当年流过血汗的地方，你们的下一代，正在实现着你们当年的理想。就在点一根灯芯的地方，亮起了千万盏电灯。
    听说去年国庆节水电站发电的那天，敬老院的老人们都兴奋地伫立在电灯前，凝视着，议论着，眼睛里不禁浮起了泪花。有一位老人说：当年红军在井冈山时，就宣传过将来的社会就是苏维埃政权加电气化。那时候还不懂哩，现在，可有点明白了。
    老年人啊，井冈山的电气化还没有完全实现哩。井冈山人正在发扬三十年前点一根灯芯的革命传统，勤勤恳恳地建设。要叫井冈山的水发出更多的电，要叫电推动更多的机器，照亮更多的人家。
    在茨坪的大灯环中，最亮的是两串珍珠似的灯链，从井冈山革命烈士纪念塔上垂下来。纪念塔矗立在山顶上，这两串灯链，全茨坪都能看得到。人们说它们像革命烈士们的眼睛，日日夜夜在看着井冈山。这是多么好的比喻啊！现在，它们正像革命烈士们的眼睛一样地清澈明亮，炯炯有神，深情地注视着这一大片茨坪灯火，守卫着井冈山的喧腾的夜晚。
