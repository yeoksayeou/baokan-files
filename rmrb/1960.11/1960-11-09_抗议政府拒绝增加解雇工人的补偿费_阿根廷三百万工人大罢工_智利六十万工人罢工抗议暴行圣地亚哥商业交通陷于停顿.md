Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, November 7th: More than three million Argentine workers belonging to over seventy trade unions staged a twenty-four-hour general strike today to protest the government's veto of a law passed by parliament regarding increasing compensation fees for dismissed workers. This strike has virtually paralyzed Argentina. Mass layoffs are a major component of the "economic stabilization plan" formulated by the International Monetary Fund, which is being implemented by the Argentine government.

In this massive strike, almost 100% of industrial and commercial workers participated, including small business owners.

Transportation was brought to a standstill: trains stopped running, ports were paralyzed, and foreign airlines were also forced to suspend operations. Newspapers ceased publication, and radio and television programs were either stopped or reduced.

Banks, telegraph offices, cinemas, and theaters also ceased operations. Schools at all levels also suspended activities.

Argentina's three major trade unions – the "62" Union, the "32" Union, and the "Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement" – all participated in the general strike.

Government authorities dispatched large numbers of soldiers and police to strengthen security. In the city of Cordoba, troops patrolled the streets. The government attempted to transport state organ personnel to work in trucks, but almost all state organ departments were also on strike.

Many union figures pointed out that, although the dismissal law was the basic cause of the strike, people were also supporting the strike to express their protest against the arrest of union figures and repressive measures.

This general strike was supported by many parties and the Argentine University Federation. The Argentine newspaper "Critica" published statements from the main opposition party, the People's Radical Civic Union, and the Socialist Party supporting the workers' strike. The People's Radical Civic Union's statement said that the strike was a "reasonable reflection of the government's unjust and unreasonable attitude."

Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, November 7th: Six hundred thousand Chilean workers staged a twenty-four-hour general strike today as planned, angrily protesting the police's flagrant shooting and killing of workers who were gathering in Santiago to demand wage increases. In this act of repression against workers, which occurred on the evening of the 3rd, two people died and thirty-five were injured.

Today, transportation and commercial activities in Santiago have come to a standstill. The people of the capital held a funeral for the workers who were shot. In the suburbs of Santiago, gatherings were also held to protest police atrocities.

The strike was initiated by the United Workers' Confederation of Chile. The strike has received widespread support from the Chilean people. In the past two days, thousands of people have continuously visited the headquarters of the United Workers' Confederation of Chile to mourn the murdered workers. University students in Santiago held a strike and demonstration on the 5th to protest police atrocities. Many Chilean parties – including the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the National Democratic Party – have issued protest statements.

On the 5th, the Chilean People's Action Front filed a criminal lawsuit with the Santiago Military Prosecutor's Office against the police authorities who opened fire to suppress the masses.

However, after the start of the general strike, the Chilean authorities took further anti-democratic measures.

The government declared a state of military emergency in Santiago Province and declared the strike illegal. The Chilean Ministry of Education has ordered all schools to close.

The police conducted new repression against the demonstrators. Police carrying tear gas were sent to the sites of mass gatherings, and some more protesters were injured.

    抗议政府拒绝增加解雇工人的补偿费
    阿根廷三百万工人大罢工
    智利六十万工人罢工抗议暴行圣地亚哥商业交通陷于停顿
    据新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯7日电　属于七十多个工会的三百多万阿根廷工人今天举行二十四小时大罢工，抗议政府否决议会通过的关于增加解雇工人补偿费的法律。这次罢工使阿根廷全国实际上陷于瘫痪。大批解雇职工是阿根廷政府执行的由国际货币基金组织制定的“稳定经济计划”的主要内容之一。
    在这次声势浩大的罢工中，工业和商业职工几乎百分之百罢了工，其中包括小商人。
    交通运输陷于停顿：火车停驶、港口瘫痪、外国航空公司也被迫停止了营业。报纸停止出版，广播和电视节目也分别停止和削减。
    银行、电报局、电影院和剧院也都停止营业。各级学校也停止了活动。
    阿根廷的三个主要工会——“六十二”工会、“三十二”工会和“工会团结合作运动”都参加了这次大罢工。
    政府当局出动大批军警加强警戒。在科尔多瓦城，军队在大街上巡逻。政府曾经企图用卡车载运国家机关人员去上班，但是国家机关部门几乎也都全部罢了工。
    许多工会人士指出，虽然解雇法是引起罢工的基本原因，但是人们支持罢工也是为了表示对逮捕工会人士和镇压措施的抗议。
    这次大罢工得到许多党派和阿根廷大学生联合会的支持。阿根廷“评论报”刊载了主要反对党人民激进公民联盟以及社会党支持工人罢工的声明。人民激进公民联盟的声明说，这一罢工是“对政府不公正和不合理的态度的合理反映”。
    新华社圣地亚哥7日电　智利六十万工人今天按计划举行二十四小时总罢工，愤怒抗议警察在圣地亚哥大街上悍然开枪打死为要求增加工资而举行集会的职工。在3日晚间发生的这次镇压工人的暴行中，有二人死亡，三十五人受伤。
    今天，圣地亚哥的交通和商业活动都陷于停顿。首都人民为遭受枪杀的工人举行了葬礼。在圣地亚哥近郊，人们也举行了抗议警察暴行的集会。
    这次罢工是由智利工人统一工会发起的。罢工得到智利人民的广泛支持。在过去两天中，成千的人络绎不绝地到智利工人统一工会总办事处去吊念被害的工人。圣地亚哥的大学生5日举行了抗议警察暴行的罢课和示威游行。智利的许多党派——包括共产党、社会党、基督教民主党和国家民主党——都纷纷发表了抗议声明。
    智利人民行动阵线5日向圣地亚哥军事检察院对开枪镇压群众的警察当局提出刑事诉讼。
    但是，在总罢工开始以后，智利当局又进一步采取了反民主措施。
    政府宣布圣地亚哥省处于军事戒严状态，并且宣布罢工为非法。智利教育部已命令所有的学校停课。
    警察对示威群众进行了新的镇压。携带催泪弹的警察被派到群众集会的地点，又有一些游行者受伤。
