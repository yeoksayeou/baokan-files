    Latin American People Resolutely Oppose Subservience to American Rule
    Brazilian "Weekly" Demands the Return of Fernando de Noronha Island, Where the United States Has Built a Missile Observation Station
    Puerto Rican United Patriotic Action Party Exposes American Plan to Establish Missile Base in Paraguay
    Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 18th: The Brazilian "Weekly" published an article today demanding the return of Fernando de Noronha Island, where the United States has built a missile observation station. The article stated that the island has become an American base of aggression against Brazil.
    The article said that the American monopoly capitalist ruling group has established a powerful base in the Paraguay and Brazil border area, with the aim of conquering the entirety of South America. American military personnel, under the pretext of "defending the South Atlantic," occupy and control this base. The article pointed out that Brazil is facing the danger of being attacked from two sides: the largest base of aggression in South America in Paraguay, and another equally powerful base located approximately 400 kilometers from Natal in northeastern Brazil, on Fernando de Noronha Island, which covers an area of 19 square kilometers.
    The article quoted the observations of Brazilian Judge Jofrili, who recently visited Fernando de Noronha Island, stating that the entire island is under American occupation and control. In addition to the watchtowers that have already been built, a large amount of heavy materials and equipment have been shipped to the island, in such quantities that it is difficult to believe that these materials and equipment are only for radio control services.
    The "Weekly" also pointed out that the airport runway on the island has been reinforced to allow aircraft carrying heavy military materials and fully armed troops to land. This was funded and constructed by "General Electric Company of America" and "Pan American Airlines."
    Xinhua News Agency, November 18th: According to a report from the Latin American News Agency from San Juan, the Puerto Rican United Patriotic Action Party condemned on the 16th the American attempt to establish a missile base in Paraguay and to use South America as a target for atomic attacks.
    The Puerto Rican United Patriotic Action Party revealed that the base the United States is attempting to establish in Paraguay will not only have missile launching equipment, but will also be used as a rocket launching observation station. The party pointed out that although the American plan is secret, it is already known that the American Air Force has conducted aerial inspections of the Paraguayan Chaco region near the base in order to create photographic maps. The United Patriotic Action Party also said that a highway is being built in this area to connect it with Asuncion, and the highway will also pass through Brazilian territory and connect with the highway to the Atlantic. It said that a special runway has been built at the Asuncion airport for American military aircraft transporting equipment for the construction of this base. "Thor," "Redstone," and possibly "Pershing" missile launch pads will also be built at this base.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 18th: La Paz dispatch: Citizens of La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, threw stones at the American ambassador, Karl Strom, on the evening of the 15th, protesting the imperialist policies of Wall Street. It is reported that Karl Strom went to the University of Cochabamba that evening to deliver a speech. The audience booed him during his speech, and after he finished speaking, a group of demonstrators threw stones at him at the entrance of the school. According to the Latin American News Agency, the demonstrators were mainly workers and students who were extremely resentful of American officials.
    The news agency also said that the American officials accompanying the ambassador intended to call a taxi to take the ambassador away, but the taxi drivers received the slogan "Do not rent taxis to them," and the Americans were simply unable to rent a car.

    拉丁美洲人民坚决反对屈从美国统治
    巴西“周报”要求收回美国建有导弹观察站的斐南多诺隆耶岛
    波多黎各联合爱国行动党揭露美国要在巴拉圭设立导弹基地
    据新华社里约热内卢18日电　巴西“周报”今天发表文章，要求收复美国建有导弹观察站的斐南多诺隆耶岛。文章说，这个岛已成为美国对付巴西的侵略基地。
    文章说，美国垄断资本统治集团在巴拉圭和巴西边界地区建立了目的在于征服全部南美洲的强大基地。美国军事人员在“保卫南大西洋”的借口下，占领和控制着这个基地。文章指出，巴西正面临两大火力夹攻的危险：在巴拉圭的南美最大的侵略基地和另一个同样强大的设在距巴西东北纳塔尔城约四百公里、面积为十九平方公里的斐南多诺隆耶岛上的基地。
    文章引述了最近访问过斐南多诺隆耶岛的巴西法官若菲利的考察观感说，整个岛都在美国占领控制之下。除了已经建立的了望塔之外，大量的重型物资和装备运到了该岛，其数量之多，难以使人相信这些物资和装备只是为无线电操纵服务的。
      “周报”还指出，这个岛上的机场跑道已被加强，以便使载运重型军事物资和全副武装的军队的飞机能够着陆。这是由“美国通用电气公司”和“泛美航空公司”出资兴建的。
    新华社18日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社自圣胡安报道，波多黎各联合爱国行动党16日谴责美国企图在巴拉圭建立导弹基地并把南美作为原子攻击的目标。
    波多黎各联合爱国行动党揭露说，美国企图在巴拉圭建立的基地将不仅有导弹发射设备，而且还将用来做火箭发射观察站。这个党指出，虽然美国的计划是秘密的，但已经知道美国空军对基地附近的巴拉圭查科地区进行了空中视察，以便绘制摄影地图。联合爱国行动党还说，在这个地区正建筑一条公路和亚松森联结起来，公路还将通过巴西领土和通大西洋的公路联接。它说，亚松森飞机场已为运送建筑这个基地设备的美国军用飞机修建了一条特殊跑道。在这个基地上，还将建筑“雷神”式、“红石”式、可能还有“潘兴”式的导弹发射台。
    新华社18日讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚首都拉巴斯市民15日晚上向美国大使卡尔·斯特罗姆投掷石头，抗议华尔街的帝国主义政策。据报道，卡尔·斯特罗姆在这天晚上到哥恰邦巴大学去发表了一次演讲。听讲的人在他讲话时用嘘声轰他，讲完后，一群示威者在学校门口用石头投他。据拉丁美洲通讯社报道，示威者主要是对美国官员憎恨已极的工人和学生。
    这家通讯社还说，伴随这位大使的美国官员打算叫一辆出租汽车把大使送走，但是出租汽车司机们都得到了“不向他们出租汽车”的口号，美国佬根本租不到一辆汽车。
