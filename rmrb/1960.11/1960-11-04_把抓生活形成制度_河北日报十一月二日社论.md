In the production increase and frugality campaign centered on grain and steel, Party organizations at all levels in our province have attached great importance to arranging the lives of the masses and have created many good experiences. The experience of the Changli County Guoxiang People's Commune Party Committee in establishing a "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" system, which is introduced in this newspaper today, is one of these experiences. Implementing this system can regularize and institutionalize the work of the whole Party and the whole people in grasping livelihood.

The emergence of the "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" system is not accidental. On the one hand, with the continuous consolidation and improvement of the collective living system, the masses of commune members demand that the canteens be run better and that collective living be improved. On the other hand, from the leadership's point of view, since the beginning of this year, various localities have generally implemented the "two-five system" to improve leadership methods, and there is also a requirement for a certain system on the livelihood front to consolidate and improve the results of leadership style. The emergence of the "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" can further deepen and refine the grasp of the masses' lives, thereby promoting faster development of production.

The reason why the "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" system is a good system lies in: First, with this system, the Party Committee can regularly and systematically go deep into the front line of life, and jointly study the problems in life with the masses, canteen managers and cooks, so that the Party's leadership over the masses' life work is regularized. Second, with this system, the Party Committee can better combine the two aspects of grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other. On the one hand, through production activities, it can understand the living conditions of the masses and their opinions and requirements for life; on the other hand, it can also promote the development of production by meeting the needs of the masses through grasping life. Third, with this system, the Party Committee will grasp life more solidly, more deeply, and more specifically, so as to better implement the Party's policies, discover and solve problems more timely, and vigorously promote the in-depth development of the production increase and frugality campaign centered on grain and steel. Fourth, with such a system, the Party Committee can continuously learn from typical examples, guide the general through typical examples, and continuously improve the ability to grasp life. In general, with this system, it has far-reaching significance for better running public canteens, improving the lives of the masses, and consolidating the people's commune system.

The "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" system is a good system, but it must be developed, and its content must be continuously enriched. Therefore, the implementation of this system should adopt different forms according to different specific circumstances, and constantly enrich new content. For example, the amount of time for the "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" should vary depending on the situation. It should also be known that the implementation of any system is not a direct purpose in itself, and the most fundamental purpose is to do our work better and implement the Party's policies better. Therefore, it is necessary to actively promote and develop this system for the purpose of running the canteen well and improving the lives of the masses. In the process of implementation, two points must be noted: First, the implementation of the "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" system must combine "points" and "surface", that is, it must guide the improvement of the "surface" through the in-depth investigation of "points"; second, it must combine grasping the canteen and grasping life in an all-round way, that is, grasping the canteen work is the main thing, but other aspects should not be ignored, such as the combination of work and rest, disease prevention and control, and the supply of daily necessities, which must also be given great attention. Only in this way can we better arrange the lives of the masses in the implementation of the "Secretary's Livelihood Work Day" system, so as to successfully complete various production tasks.

    把抓生活形成制度
    河北日报十一月二日社论
    在以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动中，我省各级党的组织十分重视安排群众生活，并且创造了许多好经验。今天本报介绍的昌黎县果乡人民公社党委建立“书记生活工作日”制度的经验，就是这些经验中的一项。推行这一制度，就可使全党全民大抓生活的工作经常化、制度化。
      “书记生活工作日”制度的出现不是偶然的。一方面，随着集体生活制度的不断巩固提高，社员群众要求把食堂办得更好，把集体生活搞得更好。另一方面，从领导上说，今年以来，各地普遍推行了“二五制”，改进了领导方法，在生活战线上也要求有一定的制度来巩固改善领导作风的成果。“书记生活工作日”的出现，就可以进一步把群众生活抓深、抓细，从而促进生产的更快发展。
      “书记生活工作日”制度所以是一项良好的制度，就在于；第一，有了这项制度，党委就可以经常地有计划地深入生活第一线，同群众、同食堂管理人员和炊事人员，共同研究生活当中的问题，使党对群众生活工作的领导经常化起来。第二，有了这项制度，党委就可以把一手抓生产、一手抓生活两个方面的工作更好地结合起来，一方面，通过生产活动，了解群众生活情况，了解群众对于生活的意见和要求；另一方面，又通过抓生活满足群众的要求，来促进生产的发展。第三，有了这项制度，党委抓生活就会更扎实、更深入、更具体，从而更好地贯彻党的政策，更及时地发现问题、解决问题，有力地推动以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动深入发展。第四，有了这样一种制度，党委就可以不断地从典型中吸取经验，通过典型指导一般，不断提高抓生活的工作本领。总起来说，有了这项制度，对于更好地办好公共食堂、搞好群众生活，巩固人民公社制度有着深远的意义。
    “书记生活工作日”制度是一项良好的制度，但是它还必须发展，它的内容还必须不断充实。因此，推行这一制度，应根据不同的具体情况采取不同的形式，并且不断地充实新的内容。例如“书记生活工作日”的时间多少，应当根据情况有所变化。还应该知道，任何一项制度的推行，本身都不是直接目的，最根本的目的是要把我们的工作做得更好，把党的政策贯彻得更好。因此，必须以办好食堂、搞好群众生活为目的，积极地推行和发展这一制度。在推行中，有两点必须引起注意：第一，推行“书记生活工作日”制度，必须把“点”和“面”结合起来，也就是说，必须通过“点”的深入，去指导“面”的提高；第二，必须把抓食堂和全面抓生活结合起来，也就是说，抓好食堂工作是主要的，但是对其他方面也不能忽视，诸如劳逸结合、防治疾病、生活必需品的供应等等，也必须给予极大的重视。只有这样，才能在推行“书记生活工作日”制度中，把群众生活安排得更好，从而胜利地完成各项生产任务。
