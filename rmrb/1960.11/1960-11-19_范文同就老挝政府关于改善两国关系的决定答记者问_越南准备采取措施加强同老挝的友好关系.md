Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 18th. Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today answered questions from a Vietnam News Agency reporter regarding the decision of the Kingdom of Laos government to improve relations between the Kingdom of Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Premier Pham Van Dong's reply is as follows:

The consistent policy of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been to establish good relations with the Kingdom of Laos in all aspects, based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. A delegation from the Kingdom of Laos government, led by Prince Souvanna Phouma, visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and signed the Vietnam-Laos Joint Communiqué on August 29, 1956. Subsequently, postal and telecommunications relations were established between the two countries, and there was contact on border issues. During this period, all issues that arose between the two countries were resolved through consultation in a spirit of mutual understanding, cooperation, and mutual assistance.

However, the American interventionists and their lackeys in Laos overthrew the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma and pursued domestic and foreign policies that contradicted Prince Phouma's policies. After the coup of August 9, 1960, the Souvanna Phouma government was formed again, and this government continued to implement policies of peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and good neighborly relations. Recently, the Kingdom government decided to take measures to restore relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people warmly welcome this positive measure by the Kingdom of Laos government, as this measure is extremely in line with the interests and aspirations of the people of both countries and in line with the interests of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Premier Pham Van Dong said that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is prepared to implement all measures aimed at strengthening friendly and good neighborly relations between the two countries, and to contribute to safeguarding peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords.

    范文同就老挝政府关于改善两国关系的决定答记者问
    越南准备采取措施加强同老挝的友好关系
    新华社河内18日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同今天就老挝王国政府关于改善老挝王国和越南民主共和国之间关系的决定，回答了越南通讯社记者的问题。范文同总理的回答如下：
    越南民主共和国政府一贯遵循的政策是：在和平共处的原则的基础上和万隆会议精神基础上，同老挝王国建立各方面的良好关系。以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府代表团曾访问过越南民主共和国，并于1956年8月29日签订了越南老挝联合公报，此后，两国之间开始建立了邮电关系，在边界问题上也有了接触。在这期间，两国所发生的各项问题都以相互谅解、合作和互助的精神，通过协商获得解决。
    但是，美国干涉者和它在老挝的走狗推翻了梭发那·富马亲王的政府，并奉行与富马亲王的政策相违背的内外政策。1960年8月9日政变后，又成立了梭发那·富马政府，这个政府又继续执行和平中立和民族和睦以及睦邻关系的政策。最近，王国政府决定采取同越南民主共和国恢复关系的措施。越南民主共和国政府和越南人民热烈欢迎老挝王国政府的这一积极措施，因为这一措施极其符合两国人民的利益和愿望，符合印度支那和东南亚的和平利益。
    范文同总理说，越南民主共和国政府准备执行一切旨在加强两国之间友好和睦邻关系的措施，为正确按照日内瓦协议精神，维护印度支那和东南亚和平作出贡献。
