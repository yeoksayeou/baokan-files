Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 12th. In their performance activities, all thirty-six drama theaters in Romania are implementing the policy of serving the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    In the past theatrical season (each year from September to the following June is considered a theatrical season), many theaters in Romania have attached great importance to performing for the masses of workers and peasants. For example, since the beginning of the year, the Ploieşti National Theatre has performed over 500 plays, musicals, and puppet shows, more than half of which were performed in clubs in factories and farms, and in rural cultural centers. A total of over 200,000 workers and peasants watched their performances. Since the beginning of this year's theatrical season, Romanian theaters have continued to promote this spirit of serving the masses. The national theaters in places like Bacău and Bucecea started their first performances not in central cities but in workers' districts. In the five weeks since the beginning of the new theatrical season, over 20,000 workers in the Stalin City Theater Center and other small cities have watched their touring performances.

    This year, in addition to continuing to stage popular dramas reflecting contemporary life from last year, theaters across Romania have also rehearsed many new plays.

    贯彻面向工农群众方针
    罗许多剧院到工厂农村演出
    新华社布加勒斯特12日电  罗马尼亚全国三十六个话剧院在演出活动中贯彻面向群众的方针。
    在过去的一个戏剧季中（每年9月至次年6月为戏剧季），罗马尼亚的许多剧院都很重视到工农群众中去演出。如普罗什蒂市国家剧院从年初以来所演出的五百多场话剧、音乐和木偶戏中，有一半以上是在各地的工厂或农场的俱乐部和农村的文化馆中演出的。共有二十多万工农群众看了他们的演出。在今年的戏剧季开始以来，罗马尼亚戏院继续发扬这种面向群众的精神。巴科和布切契亚等地的国家剧院都不是在中心城市，而是在工人区开始第一场演出。斯大林市话剧院在新戏剧季开始以来的五个多星期中，就有两万多名工人中心和其它小城市中的观众看了他们的巡回演出。
    今年罗马尼亚各地的剧院除了继续上演去年受到欢迎的反映当代生活的戏剧外，还排演了许多新的话剧。
