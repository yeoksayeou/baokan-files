Cheer the New Scientific and Technological Achievements of the Soviet Union
Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology

　　The greatest festival in human history, the anniversary of the October Revolution, the birth of the world's first socialist country, is now in its forty-third year; this is a glorious festival of jubilation throughout the universe and celebration by all. We, the Chinese people, on this day express our warmest heartfelt congratulations with the same feelings of excitement as the Soviet people.

　　Our National Day is also a joyous festival in the Soviet Union. During our National Day this year, the Soviet people held celebrations, exhibitions, reports, and other activities in many places to express their brotherly friendship towards the Chinese people. At the same time, they specially invited the China-Soviet Friendship Association to send a delegation to the Soviet Union to participate in the celebrations. As a member of the delegation, I once again personally witnessed how the Soviet people were delighted and encouraged by all the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and once again felt the deep friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people.

　　Our delegation participated in city-wide mass rallies celebrating our National Day in four locations in the Soviet Union: Moscow, Minsk, Riga, and Irkutsk, and the venues were filled with jubilation. We also visited some local factories, farms, universities, exhibitions, and museums. Although our stay was only two weeks, the richness of our gains surpassed any previous visit. We saw the efforts made by the Soviet people to strive for the overfulfillment of the Seven-Year Plan and the astonishing and great achievements that had already been made. We saw the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

　　The great new scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union made a particularly deep impression on us. This was concentratedly displayed at the Exhibition of Achievements of the Soviet National Economy in Moscow. The Soviet Union's scientific achievements in outer space have reached the highest peak in the world. In just three years since the first artificial satellite was launched into space in 1957, the Soviet Union's space rockets have been able to accurately reach the moon and photograph its far side. And this year, the Soviet Union launched a spacecraft carrying animals that not only reached the predetermined altitude but also accurately and safely returned to Earth. This has opened up new prospects for astrophysics and biology, and has also created conditions for mankind to enter and conquer outer space. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Soviet scientists have also made world-shaking creations in cutting-edge sciences such as atomic energy and electronics. Nuclear-powered atomic icebreakers have already been launched, and electronic computers have also been widely used. In addition, Soviet science is also creating outstanding achievements for production automation. Now many Soviet factories have realized automated production, freeing workers from heavy physical labor. When we were in Irkutsk, we visited the completed hydropower station on the Angara River. The power generation is 660,000 kilowatts, which is not extremely large, but the entire station is managed by only four workers. Engineers control everything in the control room, relying entirely on television to observe the instruments on each floor and in each machine.

　　The advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union is a model for us to learn from. Our country's science and technology undertakings have received much help from Soviet scientists, for which we are deeply grateful. Soviet science and technology has made extremely important contributions to the entire cause of defending world peace. Tracing back to its source, this is all due to the fact that the great October Revolution forty-three years ago opened up the most glorious path in history for mankind.

　　Let us cheer for the new scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union, for the great victory of Soviet communist construction, for the unbreakable and strong unity between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and for the eternal and immortal Marxism-Leninism!

### 欢呼苏联的科学技术新成就

    欢呼苏联的科学技术新成就
    中国科学技术协会副主席　茅以升
    人类历史上最伟大的节日，世界上第一个社会主义国家的诞生的十月革命节，今天已是四十三周年了；这是个欢腾宇内、普天同庆的光辉节日。我们中国人民在这一天怀抱着和苏联人民一样的感奋心情表示最热烈的衷心祝贺。
    我们的国庆节在苏联也是个欢乐的节日。今年在我国国庆期间，苏联人民在很多地方举行了庆祝会，展览会，报告会等等活动，表示了对我国人民的兄弟般的友谊。同时还特别邀请我国中苏友好协会派遣代表团前往苏联参加庆祝活动。作为代表团的团员，我就再一次地亲眼看到苏联人民对我国人民在党和毛主席领导下所取得的一切辉煌成就是如何地欢欣鼓舞，再一次感到苏联人民对我国人民的深厚情谊。
    我们代表团在苏联莫斯科、明斯克、里加和伊尔库次克四个地方都参加了全市性的庆祝我国国庆的群众大会，会场上一派欢腾景象。我们还参观了当地的一些工厂、农庄、大学和展览会、博物馆等。我们停留的时间虽然不过两星期，但收获之丰富，却胜过以前任何一次的访问。我们看到苏联人民为争取超额完成七年计划所作的努力，已经取得惊人的巨大成就。我们看到社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    苏联伟大的科学技术新成就给了我们特别深刻的印象。这在莫斯科的苏联国民经济成就展览会上集中地显示了出来。苏联在宇宙空间方面的科学成就达到了世界的最高峰。从1957年第一颗人造卫星上天以来仅仅三年的时间，苏联的宇宙火箭已经能准确地到达月球，并拍摄了月球背面的照片。而今年苏联发射的载有动物的宇宙飞船不仅达到了预定的高空，而且能准确安全地返回地球。这为天体物理学和生物学打开了新的前景，同时也为人类进入宇宙空间、征服宇宙空间创造了条件。苏联科学家们在苏联共产党领导下，在原子能、电子学等尖端科学上也有了震惊世界的创造。以核燃料为动力的原子破冰船已经下水，电子计算机也被广泛应用。此外，苏联科学也正在为生产自动化开创了出色的成绩。现在许多苏联工厂都实现了自动化的生产，使工人摆脱了繁重的体力劳动。我们在伊尔库次克时，参观了安哥拉河上已经完成的水电站。发电功率六十六万瓩，虽不算极大，但整个只有四个工人管理。工程师在控制间调动一切，完全依靠电视来察看各层楼各机器的仪表。
    苏联的先进科学技术，是我们学习的榜样。我国的科学技术事业得到了苏联科学家们许多帮助，这是我们深深感谢的。苏联科学技术对于保卫世界和平的整个事业作出了极其重大的贡献。追本溯源，这都是由于四十三年前的伟大的十月革命为人类开辟了一条历史上最光辉的道路的结果。
    让我们为苏联的科学技术新成就，为苏联共产主义建设的巨大胜利，为中苏两国人民牢不可破的坚强团结，为不朽的马克思列宁主义的万古长青而欢呼！
