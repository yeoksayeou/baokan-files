Vietnam's "Study Magazine" Praises China's Peaceful Foreign Policy
China Stands at the Forefront of the Struggle to Safeguard Peace

The recently published tenth issue of the Vietnamese Labor Party's political theory journal "Study Magazine" (monthly) contains an article entitled "The Constantly Growing People's Republic of China," warmly praising the great achievements China has made in all aspects of the Great Leap Forward and China's peaceful foreign policy.

The article states: Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories in the cause of national construction, making tremendous contributions to the development of the invincible strength of socialism. Despite the fact that the imperialist bloc headed by U.S. imperialism stubbornly refuses to recognize China, and tries every possible means to hinder the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and intensifies its provocations and slanders against China, the People's Republic of China still exists and continues to grow stronger. China's position and prestige are rising day by day in Asia and the world.

The article points out, "The Chinese government and people have consistently supported the national liberation movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in the past and present. China has stood with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries at the forefront of the struggle against the imperialist bloc headed by the United States and in defense of world peace." After recalling the Chinese government's great contributions to the restoration of peace in Indochina in 1954, its contributions to strengthening friendly relations with Asian and African countries at the Bandung Conference in 1955, and the recent proposal by Premier Zhou Enlai aimed at preventing war and safeguarding world peace by establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Pacific, the article states that the people of Asian countries warmly welcome the Chinese government's peaceful initiatives, viewing this as a great contribution to peace in Asia and the world.

The article says, when talking about China’s support for the world's national independence movements, that the Chinese government and people not only support Asian, African, and Latin American countries spiritually, but also help these countries develop their own independent economies. This kind of economic relationship completely and correctly follows the spirit of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation in consolidating national independence and safeguarding world peace.

The article points out that the imperialist bloc and its reactionary running dogs are trying every possible means to continue to undermine the friendly relations between China and various peaceful and neutral countries in Asia. However, the Chinese government has recently resolved the border issue with the Burmese government well and is in the process of doing so with the Nepalese government, while also signing treaties of friendship and non-aggression. China has also strived to find all appropriate methods to concretely resolve the Sino-Indian border issue and the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The Chinese government's initiative in resolving the above-mentioned issues with neighboring countries on the basis of peaceful consultation is a shining example of the Chinese government and people's policy of peaceful coexistence, and it is also a blow to the dark schemes of the imperialist bloc and its reactionary running dogs to split and undermine the friendly relations between China and peaceful and neutral countries.

The article states that China's correct peaceful foreign policy and powerful strength in all aspects have been and are increasingly enhancing the role and position of the People's Republic of China, and are playing a huge role in the entire political life of the people of Asia and the world and in the cause of maintaining lasting peace.

    越南“学习杂志”赞扬我国和平外交政策
    中国站在维护和平斗争最前列
    新近出版的越南劳动党政治理论刊物“学习杂志”（月刊）第十期刊载了一篇题为“不断壮大的中华人民共和国”的文章，热烈赞扬中国在大跃进中各方面取得的巨大成就和中国的和平外交政策。
    文章中说：中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，在建设国家事业中已经取得了辉煌的胜利，为发展社会主义无敌的力量作出了巨大贡献。尽管以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团顽固地不肯承认中国，并想尽种种办法来阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国中取得合法地位，并且加紧对中国进行挑衅和诬蔑，中华人民共和国仍然存在和不断壮大。在亚洲和世界上，中国的地位和威信日益提高。
    文章指出，“中国政府和人民过去和现在一贯支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的民族解放运动。中国已经同苏联和社会主义阵营各国站在反对以美国为首的帝国主义集团和维护世界和平事业的斗争的最前列。”文章在追述了中国政府1954年为恢复印度支那和平所作的巨大贡献，1955年在万隆会议上为加强同亚非各国之间的友好关系所作出的贡献，以及最近周恩来总理提出的旨在防止战争、保卫世界和平的在太平洋建立无原子武器区域的建议之后说，亚洲各国人民都热烈欢迎中国政府的和平倡议，把这看作是对亚洲和世界和平的巨大贡献。
    文章在谈到中国对世界民族独立运动的支持时说，中国政府和人民不仅在精神方面支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国，而且还帮助这些国家发展本国的独立经济。这种经济关系完全正确地遵循巩固各国的民族独立、保卫世界和平的平等互利的合作精神。
    文章指出，帝国主义集团及其反动走狗正在想尽一切办法继续破坏中国同亚洲各和平中立国家之间的友好关系。但是，最近中国政府已经同缅甸政府并正在同尼泊尔政府良好地解决边界问题，同时还签订了友好和互不侵犯条约。中国也曾经努力想出一切适当办法，来具体解决中印边界问题和印度尼西亚华侨问题。中国政府同各邻国在和平协商的基础上，主动解决上述问题，是中国政府和人民的和平共处政策的光辉榜样，同时也是给帝国主义集团及其反动走狗企图分裂和破坏中国同和平中立各国之间的友好关系的黑暗阴谋的一个打击。
    文章说，中国的正确的和平外交政策和各方面的强大力量已经和正在使中华人民共和国的作用和地位日益提高，并且对亚洲和全世界人民的全部政治生活和维护持久和平事业起着巨大作用。
