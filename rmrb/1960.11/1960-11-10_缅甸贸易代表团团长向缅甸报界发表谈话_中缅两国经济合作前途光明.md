Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, November 9th: U Myo, member of the House of Representatives of Burma and head of the Burmese trade delegation, gave a talk to the Burmese press on November 8th, warmly praising China's economic construction achievements and expressing the hope for further development of trade between China and Burma.

U Myo returned on the afternoon of the 8th after visiting China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

U Myo said that China's economic construction is progressing rapidly. After the Great Leap Forward in the past two years, China has produced many products that it could not produce in the past. He said that at this rate, China will certainly be able to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products within ten years.

The Burmese entrepreneur visited Western countries before 1957. He said that he was most interested in China's construction, because compared with Western countries, China's construction is much faster and better. China was originally very poor, and it is not easy to change from a poor country to a wealthy country.

Speaking of China's people's communes, U Myo said that people's communes are really good. He pointed out that the so-called "breaking up families" and "famine" are completely rumors. On the contrary, with the people's communes, people can devote themselves wholeheartedly to work, making China's economic construction progress faster.

U Myo said that during his visit to China, he was most interested in paper mills, cement plants, textile mills, sugar refineries, and iron and steel plants, especially those factories that combine indigenous and foreign methods. He believes that Burma can also

    缅甸贸易代表团团长向缅甸报界发表谈话
    中缅两国经济合作前途光明
    新华社仰光9日电　缅甸国会代表院议员、缅甸贸易代表团团长吴妙8日向缅甸报界发表谈话，热烈赞扬中国经济建设的成就，并且希望进一步发展中缅两国的贸易。
    吴妙是在访问了中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国后于8日下午回国的。
    吴妙说，中国的经济建设进展很快。在最近两年的大跃进以后，中国生产了许多过去不能生产的产品。他说，中国以这样的速度肯定能够在十年内，在主要工业品的产量方面赶上英国。
    这位缅甸企业家在1957年以前访问过西方国家。他说，他对于中国的建设最感兴趣，因为同西方国家比较，中国的建设是快得多和好得多。中国原先很穷，从一个贫穷的国家改变成为一个富裕的国家不是一件容易的事。
    吴妙在谈到中国的人民公社时说，人民公社实在好。他指出，所谓“拆散家庭”和“饥饿”的说法完全是谣言，相反，有了人民公社，人们可以全心全意地致力于工作，使中国的经济建设进展得更快。
    吴妙说，他在这次访问中国期间最感兴趣的是造纸厂、水泥厂、纺织厂、制糖厂和炼铁厂，特别是那些土洋结合的工厂。他认为，缅甸也可以开办这样的工厂。
    吴妙在谈到中缅两国的经济合作和贸易关系时说，两国的贸易关系非常好，特别是自从签订中缅友好和互不侵犯条约、中缅边界条约以后，两国的经济合作和贸易关系有了更光明和广泛的前途。
    据新华社仰光8日电　由缅甸联邦国会议员吴妙率领的缅甸贸易代表团在访问中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以后，今天下午乘飞机回到仰光。
