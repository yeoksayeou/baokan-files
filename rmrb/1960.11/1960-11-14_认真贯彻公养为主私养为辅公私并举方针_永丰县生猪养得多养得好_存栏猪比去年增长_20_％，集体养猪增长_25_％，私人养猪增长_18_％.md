This newspaper’s Nanchang, 13th dispatch: Yongfeng County, Jiangxi Province, persists in implementing the policy of public raising as the mainstay, private raising as a supplement, and combining public and private efforts, and the number of pigs raised continues to rise. Since the beginning of this year, in addition to the pigs the state has transferred and sold domestically according to plan, the actual number of pigs in stock now is 20% higher than last year. Among them, collective pig raising has increased by 25% compared to last year, and private pig raising has increased by 18%. Every household of commune members raises one or two pigs.

The large-scale development of pig production has enabled every commune in the county not only to complete the state's transfer plan on time and ensure the local meat supply, but also to greatly increase the income of the communes and members, and effectively solve the fertilizer needed for the development of agricultural production.

Wherever the policy of "public raising as the mainstay, private raising as a supplement, and combining public and private efforts" is resolutely implemented, the pig industry can develop rapidly. The experience of Yongfeng County once again proves this point. In collective pig raising, Yongfeng County, in addition to actively developing collectively-run pig farms run by communes and brigades, also vigorously develops small-scale pig farms run by production teams and canteens, fully tapping the potential of production teams and canteens for pig raising. At the same time, in accordance with the "principle of self-breeding and self-raising," it is determined that collectively-run pig farms run by communes and brigades should focus on raising breeding pigs, sows, and meat pigs, vigorously breed piglets, enrich themselves, and support production teams, canteens, and members with pig sources. Now, every commune has established a larger collective pig farm; all two hundred and sixty-seven brigades have also established pig farms; small-scale pig farms run by production teams and canteens have been universally developed.

In private pig raising, in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of commune members in raising pigs, they repeatedly publicized the pig-raising policy of "walking on two legs." Each commune, brigade, and production team has a deputy cadre mainly in charge of private pig raising. The communes also generally implement "six provisions" for pig-raising households: giving time, giving feed land, giving feed grain, giving pig sources, providing loans, and giving meat coupons. Due to the fulfillment of the "six provisions," every household has raised pigs.

    认真贯彻公养为主私养为辅公私并举方针
    永丰县生猪养得多养得好
    存栏猪比去年增长20％，集体养猪增长25％，私人养猪增长18％
    本报南昌13日电　江西永丰县坚持贯彻公养为主、私养为辅、公养私养并举的方针，养猪数量持续上升。今年以来，全县除按国家计划外调、内销生猪以外，现在实有存栏猪比去年增长20％。其中集体养猪比去年增长25％，私人养猪比去年增长18％，社员家家户户都养了一头到两头猪。
    生猪生产大发展，全县每个公社不仅按时完成了国家上调计划，保证了当地肉食供应，同时还大大增加了公社和社员收入，有力地解决了发展农业生产需要的肥料。
    哪里坚定不移地贯彻“公养为主、私养为辅、公养私养并举”的方针，哪里养猪业就能迅速大发展。永丰县的经验再一次证明了这一点。永丰县在集体养猪方面，除积极发展社办、大队办的集体养猪场外，还大力发展小队、食堂小型养猪场，充分挖掘小队和食堂的养猪潜力；同时按照“自繁自养的原则”，确定社办和大队办的集体养猪场以养种猪、母猪和肉猪并重，大力繁殖仔猪，充实自己，并支援小队、食堂和社员猪源。现在每个公社都办起了一个较大的集体养猪场；二百六十七个大队，也队队办了养猪场；小队和食堂的小型养猪场更得到了普遍发展。
    在私人养猪方面，为了调动社员养猪的积极性，反复宣传“两条腿走路”的养猪方针，公社、大队、小队有一名副职主要干部管私人养猪。各公社对养猪户还普遍实行了“六给”：给时间、给饲料地、给饲料粮、给猪源、贷给资金、给肉票。由于“六给”兑现，家家户户都养起猪来。
