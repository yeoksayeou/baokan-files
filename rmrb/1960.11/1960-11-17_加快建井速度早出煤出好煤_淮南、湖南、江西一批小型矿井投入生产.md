Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 14th: While focusing on the production of large mines, the Huainan Coal Mine is also focusing on the production and construction of small and medium-sized mines. Of the thirteen small mines and one medium-sized mine newly built or under continued construction this year, ten have been put into production successively in September and October, playing an active role in increasing coal production.

In accelerating the construction of small and medium-sized mines, the Huainan Coal Mine creatively reformed the construction methods, thereby ensuring that the mines were put into production ahead of schedule. Workers at the Lizuzi Mine creatively promoted the use of wind drill supports in tunnel excavation. The cumbersome wind drill, which was originally operated by carrying it on the body, was changed to being operated on a large frame. One drilling worker now handles the work of the original three drilling workers. They also promoted a filling method, reducing the time to load one cart of waste rock from seven minutes to two minutes. In terms of lining with masonry, they also adopted a multi-work face construction method, arranging eight work faces to work simultaneously in one roadway, resulting in the mine being completed two months and nineteen days ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 14th: Jiangxi Province is vigorously transforming small coal mines with coking coal resources to develop coking coal production. By the end of October, more than 400 pairs of small coal mines had been transformed throughout the province, and coking coal production had greatly increased compared with the end of last year, powerfully promoting the development of steel production.

All localities first concentrated manpower and equipment to strengthen mining and tunneling forces. The provincial industrial departments allocated more than 200 tons of hoisting, transportation, and other equipment, nearly 1,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment, and hundreds of tons of steel to support the transformation of these mines.

Small coal mines in various localities also demonstrated a spirit of cooperation, building coke ovens locally to produce coke. Small coal mines in various localities have newly built more than 200 coke ovens, converting half of their own coking coal into coke locally, and then transporting it to steel plants. This not only reduced the amount of transportation between mines and factories, but also greatly facilitated the production of iron plants.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 14th: While focusing on current production, the coal industry departments of Hunan Province, with the mine projects transferred this year as the key point, concentrated forces to accelerate infrastructure construction and the technological transformation of small coal kilns. From January to September, eleven pairs of mines were completed and handed over for production, expanding production capacity by more than 2.38 million tons; forty-one pairs of small coal kilns completed transformation projects. These transformed small coal kilns generally increased their production capacity by one to two times compared to their original capacity.

    加快建井速度早出煤出好煤
    淮南、湖南、江西一批小型矿井投入生产
    据新华社合肥14日电　淮南煤矿在抓紧大井生产的同时，又抓中小矿井的生产和建设。今年新建、续建的十三对小井和一对中型矿井，已有十对于9、10月份先后投入生产，在增产煤炭中发挥了积极作用。
    淮南煤矿在加紧中小井的建设中，创造性的改革了施工方法，从而保证了矿井提前投入生产。李咀孜矿建井职工在巷道掘进方面推广风锤支架，使笨重的风锤由扛在身上操作，改为架设在大架上操作，一个打眼工人担负了原来三个打眼工人的工作。他们还推行了装?方法，每装一车?石由七分钟缩短到二分钟。砌?方面，他们也采用了多工作面施工方法，在一个巷道里安排八个工作面同时作业，结果使矿井提前两个月零十九天建成。
    据新华社南昌14日电　江西省大力改造有焦煤资源的小型煤矿，发展焦煤生产。到10月底止，全省已改造四百多对小型煤井，焦煤产量比去年年底大大增加，有力地促进了钢铁生产的发展。
    各地首先集中人力和设备，加强采掘力量。省工业部门调拨出二百多吨提升、运输等设备，近千瓩的发电设备和数百吨钢材，支援这些矿井改造。
    各地小型煤矿还发挥协作精神，就地建窑炼焦。各地小煤矿已新建起炼焦窑炉二百多座，把自产的一半焦煤就地炼成焦炭，再运到钢铁厂去。这样，既减少了矿厂之间的运量，又大大便利了铁厂生产。
    据新华社长沙14日电　湖南省煤炭工业部门，在抓好当前生产的同时，以今年移交矿井工程为重点，集中力量，加快基建进度和小煤窑的技术改造，1至9月份建成移交生产的矿井有十一对，扩大生产能力二百三十八万多吨；有四十一对小煤窑完成了改造工程。这些经过改造的小煤窑，一般比原来生产能力提高一至二倍。
