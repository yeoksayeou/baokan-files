Life Calls
—Remembering Félix-Roland Moumié
Yang Shuo

Opening the newspaper, I immediately saw the news of Moumié's death, and my heart sank. I stood by the desk for a long time, unable to move. This strong Cameroonian fighter had actually died, killed by the despicable hands of the enemy. During his life, his life burned like a flame, destroying the bloody rule of imperialism in Cameroon and on the African continent. The enemy then used the most shameful assassination methods to extinguish his life. He is dead, but his life has become a flash of lightning, piercing the enemy's ferocious face and illuminating the path of African people's liberation. Now, he is using his entire life to call on the African people, saying: "Be vigilant, imperialism is insidious. True independence can only be achieved through resolute struggle."

These are the words Moumié said during his lifetime. I seem to hear his impassioned tone again, and see his enthusiastic and forceful gestures. I first met him in the summer of 1958. That evening, the Cairo office of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon held a reception to commemorate the founding of the Union. Moumié, wearing a flowered hat and a wide flowered robe, spoke to the guests about their struggle for national independence and freedom. He was only in his thirties, not tall, with a kind face, and his large eyes appeared passionate and clever. His behavior was steady and his voice was deep, but it revealed a confident strength everywhere. After he finished speaking, a Cameroonian friend named Aoussou Essomba introduced me to him.

Moumié, with his large, enthusiastic eyes, shook my hand and said, "I am very happy to meet you. You know, you are the first Chinese friend I have ever met in person." I asked with a smile, "Have there been abstract contacts before?"

Moumié smiled softly and said, "It should be said that spiritual and ideological contact has existed for a long time. You are a writer, if you are willing, please come to my house when you have time and also come into contact with how my soul is?"

I naturally gladly accepted his invitation. So, on a warm African summer night, I arrived at his residence by the Nile. The furnishings in the living room were very simple, reflecting the life of a revolutionary exiled in a foreign land. His wife brought out a plate of refreshments to serve the guests.

I asked with a smile, "Do you have Cameroonian snacks?"

Moumié said, "Would you like to taste the food of our hometown? Someday I'll treat you to 'Kossam,' it tastes very good. Today, let's talk."

During the conversation, I ventured to ask him to talk about his own history. Moumié said, "There is nothing new, it's just the history of ordinary black people, full of suffering, but also full of resistance."

Suffering had plagued him since the day he was born, but it was not until he grew up, went to a school to study medicine, and had more contact with the outside world that he understood that all the suffering of black people stemmed from the evil system of colonialism. It was then that he began to resist. People like Moumié belonged to the first generation of revolutionary intellectuals on the African continent. At that time, they organized various political parties and social groups to fight for national independence. Moumié and others founded the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, and he was later elected chairman, engaging in a struggle with the French colonialists. The French rulers panicked and declared the People's Union illegal. Moumié was exiled to Sudan and eventually came to Cairo, without a penny in his pocket. African revolutionaries came to his aid. Finally, he gathered a group of union members and set up an office in Cairo, re-launching activities. He also contacted the domestic organization, where, under the command of the Union's Secretary-General, Ndioumi Njoké, a strong guerrilla force was formed, operating in the deep mountains and dense forests of Cameroon, conducting armed struggle against the colonialists.

At this time, Aoussou Essomba said from the side: "Ndioumi Njoké's guerrilla tactics are very outstanding, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, making the enemy sleepless at night. Do you know where he learned guerrilla warfare? He learned it from Mao Zedong. Whether it is marching or fighting, Ndioumi Njoké often carries Mao Zedong's works in his arms, and he can recite entire passages."

I couldn't help but sigh and say, "Is that so?"

Moumié laughed heartily: "That's how it is. If you don't believe it, I'll treat you to 'Kossam' another day, and there's something else to show you."

Eating Kossam was at Aoussou Essomba's house. Before eating, Moumié waved and led me into Aoussou Essomba's study, opening the doors of two bookcases. Suddenly, I heard a high-pitched voice from the ground shouting: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!"

This was Aoussou Essomba's little boy, only two or three years old, with a head of jet-black curly hair, smiling with his little face lifted up, revealing a mouthful of beautiful little white teeth. I didn't understand the child's meaning. Moumié pinched the child's face, affectionately saying, "Yes, yes, let us meet Mao Zedong." Then he pointed to the bookcase and said to me, "Look, what is that?"

The cabinet contained several volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," in both English and French, the pages of which had turned black, I don't know how many hands had thumbed through them.

Moumié said with a twinkle in his eye, "So I said, although you are the first Chinese friend I have met, we had already deeply contacted a great Chinese mind long before you."

I then said, "You are too enthusiastic about China, you should go to China to see for yourself."

Moumié shook his head and said, "I'm sorry, I don't want to go for the time being. If I go, others will attack me, and I won't be able to operate in Africa and Europe."

His character was bright and his words were so straightforward. Before long, we started eating "Kossam." It seems to be made of glutinous rice flour, similar to our New Year cake, sticky and soft, and you have to pour a strange spicy red sauce on it when you eat it, which is completely in the style of Black Africa.

Aoussou Essomba asked me, "Do you still like to eat it?"

I said, "I like it very much."

Moumié said in a low voice, "You have to go to Cameroon, that's where it's really delicious." After saying that, he suddenly became silent, his eyes seemed deep and distant, and he also had a bit of a melancholy expression. I thought, maybe he was thinking of his homeland in the Gulf of Guinea, of the suffering people of his homeland, and of the flesh and blood relatives he had to leave behind?

He remained silent throughout this meal. After the meal, everyone sat in the living room drinking coffee. Moumié stood up and said, "Forgive me, I have many things to do tonight, so I must say goodbye first." He turned to me and said, "Goodbye, maybe we will be separated for several months."

I asked, "Are you going on a long trip?"

Moumié said, "Yes, first to Europe, and then to the United States to attend the United Nations meeting. We must ask the United Nations to discuss the Cameroon issue and immediately give Cameroon independence."

I couldn't help but say to myself, "Friend, what miracles can you expect the United Nations, manipulated by the United States, to perform?"

It is not true to say that the United States did not care about the Cameroon issue. There was such a bizarre episode.

In the autumn of 1958, Ndioumi Njoké, Secretary-General of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, was assassinated by French colonial troops in the forests of the Sanaga coast and sacrificed. One morning, Aoussou Essomba received a call from the American Embassy in Cairo. A person used a sorrowful tone to first express their extreme sympathy, and then said, "Mr. Ndioumi Njoké is dead, who are you going to send to replace him? If there is no one, we are willing to help you find a Secretary-General."

Aoussou Essomba was so angry that he said loudly, "I'm sorry, Mr. American Imperialist, you should be more concerned about your own bad luck. Our affairs, we don't need you to worry about."

At the United Nations meeting, what kind of kindness would the United States pretend to show to Cameroon? This is worth pondering. Unfortunately, during the meeting, I couldn't find any news in the newspaper. It wasn't until Moumié returned to Cairo and I went to see him that I heard him say in a very激烈的 tone: "The United Nations specializes in covering up sins and does not uphold justice at all. We demanded independence, but the United States openly supported France and launched a counterattack. Now I have seen the essence of imperialism from skin to bone. If you don't eradicate it from the root, it will eat you. Only by relying on resolute struggle can we achieve true independence."

This Black African revolutionary fighter had undergone another fire, another tempering. I felt that he had changed a bit, becoming more mature and more decisive than before. At that time, I was suffering from encephalitis and was preparing to return to China for recuperation, so I said goodbye to him. He shook my hand tightly and said, "Okay, let's meet in China."

I looked at him and asked, "What? Have you decided to go to China?"

Moumié laughed heartily: "I can't stand still, I have to take a step forward."

In October 1959, Moumié did visit China. In April of this year, I went to Guinea to attend the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, and I met him again. At the meeting, he delivered an encouraging speech like a tiger, condemning the French colonialists for, under the unyielding struggle of the Cameroonian people, finally having to pretend to recognize Cameroon's independence, but still using American-equipped weapons to massacre the Cameroonian people in large numbers every day. The United States is the leader of neo-colonialism and the deadly enemy of the people of Africa and the whole world. From his words, I felt that he had fully grown up.

Before leaving Guinea, Moumié invited me to his house in Conakry for dinner. The furnishings in the living room were as simple as the residence in Cairo, but there was an additional decoration on the table: a ferocious dried crocodile.

Moumié smiled and said, "In China, don't you often educate soldiers to kill the enemy like tigers and love the people like sheep? Africa doesn't have tigers, but it has crocodiles. We must treat imperialism like a crocodile, mercilessly."

That night there was a crescent moon, and the sky was as blue as the calm Atlantic Ocean. The fragrance of tropical flowers was as strong as wine, rushing in through the window, intoxicating. After dinner, we talked freely: talking about the history of mankind in the past, talking about today, and even more about the very distant future of mankind, until the moon set and the stars sank, I reluctantly got up to say goodbye. Moumié, wearing a snow-white turn-down collar shirt, sent me to the door, watched me get in the car, waved his hand and said loudly, "See you in Cameroon in the future."

His voice still echoes in my ears, but he is no longer there. A glass of poisonous wine from imperialism murdered his life, but it could never murder his revolutionary faith and will. Doesn't his death encourage the Cameroonian people to move forward! Encourage the Cameroonian guerrillas to move forward! Encourage the people of all Africa to move forward! I firmly believe that one day, I will be able to go to Moumié's truly independent homeland of Cameroon. I will face the mountains of Cameroon, the waters of Cameroon, and shout Moumié's name loudly. He dedicated himself to his country, and his name will forever coexist with the mountains and rivers of his country.

    生命在号召
    ——记费利克斯·穆米埃
    杨朔
    翻开报纸，一眼看见穆米埃逝世的消息，我的心往下一沉，立在桌子边上久久不动。这位坚强的喀麦隆战士竟而死了，死在敌人卑鄙的毒手里。生前，他的生命像火焰一般地烧毁着帝国主义在喀麦隆和非洲大陆上的血腥统治，敌人便使用了最可耻的暗杀手段来扑灭他的生命。他死了，他的生命却变成一道电光，划破敌人凶狠的嘴脸，照亮非洲人民解放的道路。现在，他是在用整个生命向非洲人民号召说：“警惕啊，帝国主义是阴险的。真正的独立只有从坚决的斗争中才能取得。”
    这是穆米埃生前说过的话，我仿佛又听见他那激昂慷慨的音调，又看见他那热烈有力的手势。我初次认识他是在1958年夏天。那晚上，喀麦隆人民联盟开罗办事处举行招待会，纪念联盟的创立。穆米埃戴着顶花帽子，穿着件宽大的花袍子，对客人们谈着他们争取祖国独立自由的斗争。他只有三十几岁，身材不高，面貌和善，两只大眼显得热情而又机灵。他的举动稳重，嗓音浑厚，却又处处透着自信的力量。赶他讲完话，一位叫奥山地的喀麦隆朋友把我介绍给他。
    穆米埃闪着热情的大眼，握着我的手说：“很高兴认识你。你知道，你还是我从实体上接触的头一个中国朋友呢。”我笑着问：“抽象的接触从前有过么？”
    穆米埃挺柔和地笑着说：“应该说灵魂思想上的接触早就有了。你是个作家，如果愿意的话，有空请到我家来，也来接触接触我的灵魂怎样？”
    我自然乐意接受他的邀请。于是在一个温暖的非洲夏夜里，我到了尼罗河边上他的住宅里。客厅的布置十分简单，是一个流亡在异国他乡的革命者的生活。他的妻子捧出一盘点心来敬客。
    我笑着问：“可有喀麦隆点心？”
    穆米埃说：“你想尝尝我们家乡的饮食么？等几时请你吃‘餶酥餶酥’，味道好得很。今天先谈心。”
    谈心当中，我冒昧地请他谈谈自己的历史。穆米埃说：“没有什么新鲜的，无非是一般黑人的历史，有的是苦难，也有的是反抗。”
    苦难从他降生那一天起便缠着他，可是直到他长大了，进了一所学校去学医，跟外界接触的多，他才懂得黑人的一切苦难都来源于殖民主义的罪恶制度，这才开始反抗。像穆米埃这一辈人，属于非洲大陆上第一代的革命知识分子，当时纷纷组织各种政党和社会团体，争取民族独立。穆米埃和人一起创建了喀麦隆人民联盟，后来又被选为主席，跟法国殖民主义者展开了搏斗。法国统治者慌了，宣布人民联盟不合法。穆米埃被流放到苏丹，辗转来到开罗，腰里一文钱都没有。非洲的革命者都来援助他。终于他又集合一批盟员，在开罗设立办事处，重新展开活动。跟国内的组织也联络上了，那里正在联盟总书记尼奥比的指挥下，组成一支强悍的游击队，活动在喀麦隆的深山密林里，对殖民主义者进行着武装斗争。
    这时奥山地从一旁说：“尼奥比的游击战术十分出色，神出鬼没，打得敌人夜不安眠。你知道他从哪儿学来的游击战？是从毛泽东学来的。无论是行军作战，尼奥比怀里经常揣着毛泽东的著作，他能整段整段地背诵出来呢。”
    我不禁叹息说：“是这样么？”
    穆米埃爽朗地笑起来：“就是这样嘛。不信改一天请你吃‘餶酥餶酥’，还有东西给你看。”
    吃餶酥餶酥是在奥山地家里。吃饭以前，穆米埃招一招手，领我走进奥山地的书房里，打开两扇书橱门。忽然听见地面上有一个尖细的声音喊：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”
    这是奥山地的小男孩，才三两岁，生着一头漆黑的鬈发，正仰着小脸笑得露出一口漂亮的小白牙。我不明白小孩的意思。穆米埃捏一捏小孩的脸蛋，怪亲昵地说：“对，对，让我们会一会毛泽东。”便指着书橱对我说：“你看，那是什么？”
    橱里藏着好几卷《毛泽东选集》，有英文本，也有法文本，书页都变黑了，不知经过多少人手的翻弄。
    穆米埃闪动着大眼笑道：“所以我说，你虽然是我接触的头一个中国朋友，可是在你之前，我们早就深深地接触了一个伟大的中国心灵。”
    我便说道：“你对中国太热情了，应该亲自到中国去看看啊。”
    穆米埃摇摇头说：“对不起，我暂时还不想去。如果去了，别人该攻击我，我就无法在非洲和欧洲活动了。”
    他的性格明朗，说话也是这样直爽。不一会，我们开始吃“餶酥餶酥”。这好像是用糯米粉做成的，类似我们的年糕，又粘又软，吃的时候要浇上一种怪辣的红汁，倒是十足的黑非洲风味。
    奥山地问我道：“还喜欢吃么？”
    我说：“很喜欢。”
    穆米埃哑声说：“你要到喀麦隆去，那才真正好吃呢。”说完他忽然变得沉默起来，眼神显得又深又远，还带着点忧郁的表情。我想，也许他是想起自己远在几内亚湾的祖国，想起自己正在受难的祖国人民，也想起自己不得不抛离的骨肉亲朋吧？
    这一餐饭，他一直沉默着。饭后，大家坐在客厅里喝咖啡，穆米埃站起来说：“原谅我，我还有许多事情今天晚上得赶着做完，必须先告辞了。”又转过脸对我说：“再见吧，也许我们要有好几个月的分别呢。”
    我问道：“要出远门么？”
    穆米埃说：“是的，先到欧洲，然后再到美国去参加联合国会议。我们必须要求联合国讨论喀麦隆问题，立刻给喀麦隆独立。”
    我不禁在心里暗暗说：“朋友，你能期望美国操纵的联合国做出什么奇迹来呢？”
    说美国不关心喀麦隆问题，也不是事实。就有这样一段古怪的插曲。
    1958年秋天，喀麦隆人民联盟总书记尼奥比在沙纳加海滨的森林里遭到法国殖民军的暗算，牺牲了。有一天早晨，奥山地接到开罗美国大使馆的电话，一个人用悲哀的调子先表示了他们极端的同情，然后说：“尼奥比先生死了，你们准备派谁代替他呢？如果没有人，我们愿意帮你们物色个总书记。”
    气的奥山地大声说：“对不起，美帝国主义先生，你还是多关心一下自己的倒霉命运吧。我们的事，不劳你费心。”
    在联合国会议上，美国对喀麦隆又会装出一副怎样的好心肠，这是值得玩味的。可惜会议期间，我在报上见不到什么消息。直到穆米埃回到开罗，我去看他，才听见他用十分激烈的口气说：“联合国专门包庇罪恶，不主持一点公道。我们要求独立，美国却公开支持法国，进行反扑。现在我算从皮到骨头看清帝国主义的本质。你不连根消灭它，它就要吃你。只有依靠坚决的斗争，才能取得真正的独立。”
    这位黑非洲的革命斗士这次算又经历一次火烧，一次锤炼。我觉得他有点变了，变得比先前更加纯熟，更加果决。当时我因正害脑病，准备回国休养，就向他告别。他紧紧握着我的手说：“好，咱们中国见。”
    我望着他问道：“怎么？你决定到中国去了么？”
    穆米埃爽爽朗朗笑起来道：“我不能老站在原地方，得跨前一步啊。”
    1959年10月，穆米埃果然访问了中国。今年4月，我到几内亚去参加第二届亚非人民团结大会，跟他又会了面。在会上，他曾经像生龙活虎似的，发表一篇富有鼓动力量的讲话，谴责法国殖民者在喀麦隆人民百折不挠的斗争之下，最后不得不假装承认喀麦隆独立，却又天天用美国配备的武器大量屠杀喀麦隆人民。美国正是新殖民主义的头子，是非洲和全世界人民的死敌。从他的话里，我觉得他已经完全成长起来了。
    临离开几内亚以前，穆米埃又请我到他科纳克里的家里去吃晚饭。客厅的布置像开罗的住宅一样朴素，只是桌子上多了件陈设：一只勇猛的干鳄鱼。
    穆米埃笑道：“在中国，你们不是常教育战士要杀敌如虎、爱民如羊么？非洲没有虎，可有鳄鱼。我们对待帝国主义，就要像鳄鱼一样猛，毫不容情。”
    这晚间有弯弯的新月，天空蓝得像平静的大西洋。热带的花香浓得像酒，扑进窗来，叫人心醉。晚饭后，我们无拘无束地谈着：谈到人类以往的历史，谈到今天，更谈到人类很远很远的将来，直谈到月落星沉，我才依依不舍地起身告别。穆米埃穿着雪白的翻领衬衫，送我到门口，看着我上了车，扬一扬手高声说：“将来在喀麦隆见。”
    他的声音还荡漾在我耳边，他人却不在了。帝国主义的一杯毒酒谋杀了他的生命，却怎么也谋杀不了他那种革命的信仰和意志。他的死不正激励着喀麦隆人民在前进！激励着喀麦隆游击队在前进！激励着全非洲的人民在前进！我深信有一天，我一定能到穆米埃真正独立了的祖国喀麦隆去。我将对着喀麦隆的山，喀麦隆的水，高声唤着穆米埃的名字。他为自己的祖国而献身，他的名字将永久与他祖国的山水而共存。
