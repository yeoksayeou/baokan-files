    The New Party Secretary Opened the Lock
    Xie Honglin, a comrade from our commune's Party Committee, was sent down to the Youji Production Team to serve as the Party Branch Secretary. Upon arrival, he immediately plunged into the "three autumn harvests." While working in the fields, he learned that the commune members had grievances about the production team's work point recording method. He visited the commune members during lunchtime. The commune members said, "The production team stipulates that regardless of whether one comes to work early or late, how much one works, or the quality of the work, as long as one comes to work, one gets eight points. This is unreasonable." Based on the opinions of the commune members, Xie Honglin convened a meeting of the team leaders, workgroup leaders, and Party and League members that evening to study and establish the following system: setting reasonable labor quotas based on different farm work; adhering to the production responsibility system of assigning tasks, setting time limits, ensuring quality, determining remuneration, assigning leadership, and rewarding for exceeding quotas; strictly implementing the principles of work evaluation and point recording, more work more pay, and distribution according to labor, evaluating work on the spot, recording points in the evening, publishing them monthly, and issuing wages monthly based on work points. After this method was submitted to the commune members for discussion, it was enthusiastically welcomed. The commune members' enthusiasm increased even more. Within two days, all 186 laborers in the team harvested more than 70 mu of millet, dug up 376 mu of corn, and planted 97 mu of wheat, greatly improving production efficiency.

    新来的支书开开了锁
    我们公社党委会的谢洪林同志，下放到尤集生产队当党支部书记，他一来到，就下田忙“三秋”。在劳动中，他了解到社员对生产队出勤记分办法有意见，就在吃中午饭的时间访问了社员。社员说：“生产队规定不管出工早晚、干活多少、质量好坏，只要出来干活，就是记八分，这样不合理。”谢洪林根据社员的意见，当天的晚上召开了小队长、作业组长和党团员会议，研究并建立以下制度：根据不同农活规定合理劳动定额；坚持定任务、定时间、定质量、定报酬、定领导和超额奖励的生产责任制；严格实行评工记分、多劳多得、按劳分配的原则，就地评工，晚上记分，一月一公布，按劳动工分月发工资。这个办法交给社员讨论以后，得到了社员的热烈欢迎。社员的干劲更大了。两天内，全队一百八十六名劳动力，割谷子七十多亩、刨玉米三百七十六亩、种小麦九十七亩，生产效率大大提高。
