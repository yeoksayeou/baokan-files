Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 26th: The one hundred and forty-five state-run forest farms in Guizhou Province are actively expanding the planting of grain crops.

Based on the characteristics of the forest areas, the forest farms are opening up some new land as grain bases while actively expanding the area of intercropping between forests and grain. By early November, more than thirty state-run forest farms in Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Anshun Special District, and Guiyang City alone had sown more than 10,000 mu of crops such as wheat, peas, broad beans, and rapeseed.

In recent years, all state-run forest farms in Guizhou Province have carried out meticulous overall land preparation and strip land preparation during afforestation, providing favorable conditions for intercropping forests and grain in forest areas. This spring, state-run forest farms throughout the province intercropped more than 30,000 mu of grain crops in young forest land. More than twenty forest farms, such as the Xibo Forest Farm in Weng'an County and the San Sui Forest Farm in Zhenyuan County, which planted both extensively and well, have harvested enough grain from intercropping to feed all the employees of the farm for a year, after retaining enough seeds and fodder. The San Sui Forest Farm also sold more than 10,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    开垦荒地林粮间作并举
    贵州各国营林场扩种粮食
    新华社贵阳26日电　贵州省一百四十五个国营林场积极扩种粮食作物。
    各林场根据林区特点，一面新开部分田土，作为粮食基地；一面积极扩大林粮间作面积。到11月上旬，仅黔南布依族苗族自治州、安顺专区和贵阳市等地三十多个国营林场，就已播种小麦、豌豆、胡豆、油菜等作物一万多亩。
    几年来，贵州各个国营林场在造林时都进行了细致的全面整地和带状整地，为林区林粮间作提供了有利条件。今年春天，全省国营林场在幼林地里间种了粮食作物三万多亩。种得又多又好的瓮安县西波林场、镇远县三穗林场等二十多个林场，林粮间作收获的粮食除留足种子和饲料外，够全场职工吃上一年；三穗林场还卖出一万多斤余粮给国家。
