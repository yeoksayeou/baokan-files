    Sending cadres to lower levels is a glorious task
    Qiao Huairen
    Whether a policy can be correctly implemented depends crucially on the cadres. If cadres lack understanding of the Party's policies, even the best policies cannot take root among the masses and be transformed into material strength. Grassroots cadres in rural areas are the commanders on the front lines of agricultural production, and all of the Party's rural policies must be implemented through them. In this situation, continuously helping grassroots cadres improve their understanding of policies is of utmost importance. Therefore, the practice of comrade Zhang Junxian, a cadre sent to lower levels, in helping grassroots cadres study policies is worthy of great promotion.
    In helping grassroots cadres study the Party's policies, the most important step is to help them understand the spirit and essence of the Party's policies, and truly understand what should be done and what should not be done. The formulation of any of the Party's policies has its objective basis, taking into account both the objective conditions at the time and the level of awareness of the masses; considering both the collective and long-term interests, as well as the individual and immediate interests. For example, a series of policies concerning the three-level ownership with the production team as the basic accounting unit in the people's commune and distribution according to work are all adapted to the current objective situation. Correctly implementing these policies will promote the continuous development of production; failure to conscientiously implement these policies will affect the development of production. When helping grassroots cadres study the Party's policies, they should be consciously guided to understand why these policies are needed at present? What is the difference and connection between these policies and the Party's ultimate goal? Only by truly understanding these principles will they not lose their way or waver when encountering various specific problems.
    In order to help grassroots cadres understand the spirit and essence of the Party's policies, study must also be combined with the specific situation of the local area. It should be understood that the Party's various policies are a high-level generalization of the practical experience of the masses, and grassroots cadres directly participate in this practice and have the deepest understanding. Therefore, in study, we should earnestly summarize experience from specific examples in order to understand the Party's policies more deeply and thoroughly. Zhang Junxian is such an example. In helping grassroots cadres study policies, he always paid attention to combining theory with practice, so that grassroots cadres not only understood the spirit of the policies, but also learned how to apply them in specific situations. Of course, to achieve this, it is also necessary to improve the style of work like Comrade Zhang Junxian, and eat, live, work, and discuss with the masses. Only by being integrated with the masses in production and life can we discover and summarize the experiences in the implementation of the Party's policies at any time, better combine theory with practice, and achieve the goal of promoting production through the implementation of policies.
    At present, a large number of cadres have gone deep into the grassroots; and many more cadres are ready to go to the front lines of agricultural production. These comrades should all be like Comrade Zhang Junxian, helping grassroots cadres study the Party's policies, further improving their policy level, and making the rural people's communes even better!

    下放干部的一项光荣任务
    乔怀仁
    政策能否正确贯彻执行，决定的关键在于干部。干部若对党的政策缺乏了解，再好的政策，也不能在群众中开花结果，化为物质力量。农村基层干部，是农业生产第一线的指挥员，党的农村各项政策，都要通过他们去贯彻。在这种情况下，不断帮助基层干部提高政策水平，有着极其重大的意义。因此，下放干部张俊宪同志帮助基层干部学习政策的作法，值得大大提倡。
    在帮助基层干部学习党的政策时，首要的一环，在于帮助他们领会党的政策的精神实质，真正弄清楚应该做什么，不应该做什么。党的任何政策的制订，都有其客观依据，既考虑到当时的客观条件，也估计到群众的觉悟程度；既考虑到集体的、长远的利益，也照顾到个人的、当前的利益。比如有关人民公社的队为基础的三级所有制和按劳分配等一系列政策，都是和当前的客观形势相适应的。正确地执行这些政策，就能促使生产不断发展；没有认真执行这些政策，就会使生产的发展受到影响。在帮助基层干部学习党的政策时，应当有意识地引导他们弄清楚为什么这些政策是当前所需要的？它和党的最终目的有什么区别，又有什么联系？只有真正懂得了这些道理，在碰到各项具体问题时，才不会迷失方向，左右摇摆。
    为了帮助基层干部了解党的政策的精神实质，在学习时，还必须和当地的具体情况结合起来。要知道，党的各项政策，都是群众实践经验的高度概括，而基层干部又直接参与这一实践，体会也最深。因此在学习时，应从具体事例中来认真地总结经验，才能对党的政策理解得更深、更透。张俊宪就是这样。他在帮助基层干部学习政策时，始终注意理论和实际相结合，使基层干部既领会了政策的精神，又学会了具体的运用。当然，要做到这一点，还必须像张俊宪同志那样，改进工作作风，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。只有在生产和生活上与群众打成一片，才能随时发现和总结党的政策在贯彻执行中的经验，更好地使理论和实际结合起来，达到贯彻政策推动生产的目的。
    目前，已有大批干部深入基层；还有许多干部整装待发，准备奔赴农业生产第一线。这些同志都应当像张俊宪同志那样，帮助基层干部学习党的政策，进一步提高他们的政策水平，把农村人民公社办得更好！
