Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: News from Tokyo: The results of the Japanese House of Representatives election held on the 20th were fully revealed tonight. The Japanese Socialist Party and the Communist Party, which resolutely demand the abolition of the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and strive for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality, have significantly increased their seats, thwarting the Liberal Democratic Party's attempt to seize more than two-thirds of the seats to amend the constitution that prohibits Japan from participating in war, a plan that would have seen them succumb to the United States and adhere to the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

According to statistics announced tonight, out of the total 467 seats in the House of Representatives, the Socialist Party won 145 seats, an increase of 23 seats compared to the original 122 seats. The Socialist Party shattered the conspiracy of Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda, who publicly declared that he wanted to "suppress the Socialist Party to below 100 (members of the House of Representatives)."

The Japanese Communist Party increased from the original one seat to three seats, with a total of 1.14 million votes. The elected JCP candidates are: Shiga Yoshio, member of the JCP Central Committee's Presidium and former member of the House of Representatives; Kawakami Kanichi, member of the JCP Central Committee and former member of the House of Representatives; and Taniguchi Zentarō, member of the JCP Osaka Prefectural Committee and writer.

The seats of the right-wing Democratic Socialist Party, which split from the Socialist Party, plummeted from the original 40 seats to 17 seats.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, relying on "money and power" for the election, won 296 seats. Although this is an increase of 13 seats compared to the original number, it did not reach the 320 seats that Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda repeatedly boasted he would "definitely" obtain. The Ikeda group fantasized that this would give them the necessary statutory number of seats to amend the current constitution, which stipulates that Japan renounce war, in order to freely implement the aggressive Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty.

In addition, one candidate from a small party and five independent candidates were elected.

United Press International commented on the Japanese general election, saying: "This election is widely regarded as a test of whether the Ikeda government's strong pro-American policy is popular. If the ruling party cannot obtain at least 300 seats, it will be considered a defeat."

UPI also had to admit: "Even before the final statistics appeared, the Socialist Party, which fiercely opposed the ruling party's pro-American policy, had already achieved a moral victory."

A spokesman for the Japanese Socialist Party said today: "This election unmistakably proves that more and more people refuse to accept the current U.S.-Japan military ties." He believes that the Socialist Party's victory in the election is mainly because the Japanese people support a neutral policy.

The progress of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party in the election was achieved under very difficult conditions. The Ikeda government and the Liberal Democratic Party used their ruling position to suppress progressive forces, restrict and sabotage the election activities of progressive parties, and launched bourgeois propaganda machines to vigorously promote the Ikeda cabinet's so-called "doubling national income" and "building a welfare state" and other false policies to swindle votes. Japanese monopoly capitalists provided twice as much campaign funding for the Liberal Democratic Party to bribe voters this time compared to the last election, and U.S. imperialists also openly came forward to slander the JCP and the Socialist Party during the election, supporting the Liberal Democratic Party. Under these circumstances, the manipulation of the election was extremely serious. Even Kyodo News today said: This election was a "money and power election that seriously undermined fair elections."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzō Nosaka commented on the results of the Japanese general election, pointing out that although the U.S.-Japan reactionaries used various despicable means to suppress and sabotage the JCP's election activities, the JCP's seats still increased from one to three, and the number of votes for JCP candidates also increased, which means that the JCP has made valuable progress.

Nosaka pointed out the characteristics of this general election. He said that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which carried out a joint struggle in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," made significant progress; in contrast, the Democratic Socialist Party, which opposed neutrality and in fact adopted a position of supporting the "Security Treaty," suffered a disastrous defeat.

Nosaka said that the JCP will continue to fight for Japan's independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality.

Nosaka made these remarks at a press conference held by JCP General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto.

Miyamoto Kenji pointed out at the meeting that the increase in the seats of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party shows the Japanese people's will to oppose the "Security Treaty." He said that the JCP's progress this time was based on doubling the number of party members, recognizing the enemy, and carrying out an uncompromising struggle against the enemy.

Miyamoto said that the JCP will continue to strengthen the party's forces with firm confidence in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement tonight on the results of the general election, stating that it will devote all its efforts to safeguarding the constitution and striving to realize a democratic and neutral Japan in the future.

The statement said that the democratic forces have obtained the seats needed to prevent the Liberal Democratic Party from amending the constitution, which we are pleased about. The statement pointed out that the democratic forces thwarted the Liberal Democratic Party's ambition to exceed 300 seats.

The statement said that the progress of the Socialist Party is the result of the Socialist Party uniting with the Japanese people in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," especially the result of the democratic forces led by the working class rising up to launch a struggle.

The statement emphasized that the progress of the Socialist Party marks the increasing support of the Japanese people for a neutral policy, and it will definitely be further strengthened in the future.

The elected members of the Japanese Socialist Party have issued statements expressing their determination to fight for Japan's independence, democracy, and neutrality. Akira Kazami, chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations, said that he will strive to realize the long-cherished wish of the Japanese people to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations as soon as possible in the future. Tadashi Yaoita, chairman of the Socialist Party's election countermeasures committee, said that the Socialist Party will work with the Japanese people to break away from the military alliance and strive for neutralization.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: Kozo Minaguchi, Secretary-General of the Japanese "National Conference to Stop Revision of the Security Treaty," made a statement this afternoon on the progress made by the Socialist Party and the Communist Party in the election, saying, "We will move our struggle forward with greater confidence."

He said: The election results reflect the strong struggle of all the democratic forces united around the "National Conference to Stop Revision of the Security Treaty" for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty.

He also said: "The election results prove that our movement is a just cause."

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan issued a statement today on the results of the general election, stating that it will unite all workers to fight against the Japanese government's policies of maintaining the interests of monopoly capital and exploiting workers. The statement pointed out that the results of this election prove that the Japanese working class's struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the struggle to improve people's living standards are correct.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 19th: Two thousand union members in Kyoto held a rally last night, demanding the abolition of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty."

About five hundred students in Tokyo held a rally on the afternoon of the 17th, opposing the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty and demanding the overthrow of the Ikeda government.

The resolution passed at the meeting also called for the establishment of a neutral government, demanded an end to the policy of hostility towards China, and opposed the government's revision of the Basic Law on Education to revive militaristic education. After the meeting, the students held a demonstration in the downtown area. Another group of about two hundred students also held a similar meeting. After the meeting, they held a demonstration near the Diet and the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence, shouting the slogan "Down with the Ikeda Cabinet."

In Hokkaido, the northernmost part of Japan, about fifty students held a demonstration in Sapporo City on the afternoon of the 18th to protest against the police's suppression of students participating in the patriotic struggle against the "Security Treaty."

In Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan, 15,000 teachers and staff held a general mobilization rally to defend education and democracy in Ōmuta City on the 13th, opposing the Ikeda government's revival of militaristic education.

    日本大选表明广大人民坚决要求和平中立
    日共和社会党议席增加，自由民主党攫取三分之二以上议席计划失败
    日共主席和社会党号召继续奋斗争取日本的独立、民主、中立
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：20日举行的日本众议院选举结果今天晚间已经全部揭晓。坚决要求废除日美军事同盟条约、争取独立、和平、民主、中立的日本社会党和共产党的议席获得显著增加，挫败了屈从美国、坚持侵略性日美军事同盟条约的自由民主党企图攫取三分之二以上议席来修改禁止日本参战的宪法的计划。
    根据今天晚间宣布的统计，在众议院全部四百六十七个议席中，社会党获得一百四十五席，比原有的一百二十二席增加了二十三席。社会党粉碎了日本首相池田勇人公开宣称要“把社会党压在一百人（众议员）以下”的阴谋。
    日本共产党从原来的一席增加为三席，得票总数达一百一十四万张。当选的日共候选人是：日共中央委员会干部会委员、前众议员志贺义雄，日共中央委员会委员、前众议员川上贯一，日共大阪府委员会委员、作家谷口善太郎。
    从社会党分裂出去的右翼的民主社会党的议席从原来的四十席猛跌为十七席。
    依靠“金钱和权力”竞选的执政的自由民主党获得二百九十六席，虽然比原有席位增加十三席，但是并没有达到日本首相池田勇人所一再公开夸口的“肯定”会得到的三百二十席。池田集团妄想这样就可以得到必要的法定议席数目来修改规定日本弃绝战争的现行宪法，以便放手实行侵略性日美军事同盟条约。
    此外，小党派有一名和无党派有五名候选人当选。
    美国合众国际社在评论这次日本大选时说：“这次大选广泛地被认为是对池田政府强烈的亲美政策是否得人心的考验，如果执政党不能获得至少三百席，那么人们就会认为这是一次挫败”。
    合众国际社还不得不承认：“甚至在最后的统计数字出现以前，猛烈反对执政党的亲美政策的社会党已经取得了一场道义上的胜利”。
    日本社会党发言人今天说：“这次选举确定不移地证明越来越多的人拒绝接受目前的日美军事联系”。他认为，这次社会党在选举中的胜利，主要是因为日本人民拥护中立政策。
    日本共产党和社会党在选举中的进展是在十分困难的条件下取得的。池田政府和自由民主党利用它们的执政地位，镇压进步力量，限制和破坏进步政党的竞选活动，并且发动资产阶级宣传机器大肆宣传池田内阁的所谓使“国民收入增加一倍”、“建设福利国家”等虚伪政策，来骗取选票。日本垄断资本家这次拿出了比上次选举多一倍的竞选资金供自由民主党贿选，美帝国主义者在竞选期间也公开出面诬蔑日共和社会党，为自由民主党撑腰。在这种情况下，操纵选举的情况极其严重，甚至日本共同社今天也说：这次选举是“严重地破坏公正选举的金钱和权力选举”。
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本共产党主席野坂参三评论日本大选结果时指出，虽然美日反动派使用种种卑鄙手段压迫和破坏日共的竞选活动，日共的议席仍然从一席增加到三席，投日共候选人的票也增加了，这意味着日共取得了可贵的前进。
    野坂指出了这次大选的特点。他说，在反对日美“安全条约”斗争中进行共同斗争的共产党和社会党取得了显著进展；与此相反，反对中立而事实上采取支持“安全条约”立场的民主社会党遭到惨败。
    野坂表示，日共将继续为争取日本的独立、和平、民主和中立而奋斗。
    野坂是在由日共总书记宫本显治举行的记者招待会上发表这些谈话的。
    宫本显治在会上指出，共产党和社会党议席的增加表明日本人民反对“安全条约”的意志。他说，日共这次前进是以党员增加一倍、认清敌人，同敌人进行不妥协的斗争为基础而取得的。
    宫本表示，日共今后将坚定信心，为进一步加强党的力量而奋斗。
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天晚间就大选结果发表声明，表示今后要全力为维护宪法和争取实现民主、中立的日本而奋斗。
    声明说，民主力量得到能够阻止自由民主党修改宪法所需要的议席，这是我们感到高兴的。声明指出，民主力量挫败了自由民主党想要超过三百个议席的野心。
    声明说，社会党的进展是社会党团结起来同日本人民在一起进行了反对日美“安全条约”斗争的结果，尤其是以工人阶级为首的民主力量奋起展开斗争的结果。
    声明强调指出，社会党的进展标志着日本人民对中立政策的支持日益加强，并且今后一定会进一步加强。
    日本社会党的当选者纷纷发表谈话，表示要为日本的独立、民主、中立而斗争。恢复日中邦交国民会议理事长风见章表示，他今后将为尽速实现日本人民多年来的迫切愿望——恢复日中邦交而奋斗。社会党选举对策委员长八百板正表示，社会党将同日本人民在一起，为摆脱军事同盟、为实现中立化而努力。
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”事务局长水口宏三今天下午就社会党和共产党在选举中所获得的进展发表谈话说，“我们将以更大的信心来把我们的斗争推向前进。”
    他说：选举结果反映了团结在“阻止修改安全条约国民会议”周围的一切民主力量为废除日美军事同盟条约而进行的强大斗争。
    他并且说：“选举结果证明我们的运动是正义的事业”。
    日本工会总评议会今天就大选结果发表声明，表示将团结全体工人同日本政府维护垄断资本利益和剥削工人的政策进行斗争。声明指出，这次选举结果证明，日本工人阶级所展开的反对日美“安全条约”斗争和为争取提高人民生活水平的斗争是正确的。
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：京都的两千名工会会员昨天晚上举行大会，要求废除新日美“安全条约”。
    东京的大约五百名学生在17日下午举行大会，反对日美军事同盟条约，要求打倒池田政府。
    大会通过的决议还要求成立中立政府，要求停止敌视中国政策，并且反对政府修改教育基本法来复活军国主义教育。会后，学生们在市内闹区举行了示威。另外一批学生约二百人也举行了类似的大会。会后，他们到国会和日本首相官邸附近举行示威，高呼“打倒池田内阁”的口号。
    在日本最北部的北海道，约有五十名学生18日下午在札幌市举行了示威游行，抗议警察镇压参加反对“安全条约”爱国斗争的学生。
    在日本南部的福冈县，一万五千名教职员曾经于13日在大牟田市举行保卫教育和民主总奋起大会，反对池田政府复活军国主义教育。
