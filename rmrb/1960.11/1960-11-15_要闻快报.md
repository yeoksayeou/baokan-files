    **Changdu Area Implements the “Two-Five System” Leadership Method**

    The Changdu Special District and the various county and district organs in Tibet, in light of the specific conditions of the region, are implementing the "Two-Five System" leadership method. Currently, the county Party committee offices in Changdu, Basu, Zuogong, Ningjing, Luolong, and other counties have all moved to the countryside to work. 80% of the cadres from county and district-level organs have gone deep into the front lines of production to carry out specific leadership of production work.

    After implementing the "Two-Five System" leadership method, cadres at all levels have more thoroughly implemented the instructions on "Four Togethernesses" (eat, live, work, and consult with the masses). While specifically leading production work, they are also able to participate in labor production for more time.

    **Dingxi Area Strengthens Production Team Work in Communes**

    The Dingxi Special District in Gansu Province is helping production team cadres solve problems in leadership methods and business management, so that the work of the teams has made significant progress in a short period.

    The Dingxi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China strengthened the work of the teams by adopting seven measures: First, all cadres sent to the front lines must live in the production teams and act as "advisors" to the team leaders; Second, help the teams establish leadership cores; Third, help the teams establish production work groups and production responsibility systems; Fourth, grasp the "four fixings" small-scale contracting system of fixed tasks, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed work points to ensure that all kinds of farm work are completed on time and with quality and quantity; Fifth, organize temporary collaboration groups to rush to complete production tasks; Sixth, establish a production organization and labor management system that combines the long-term plans and short-term arrangements of the production teams; Seventh, establish labor manuals and strictly evaluate work and record points.

    **Ma Guanzhuang Party Branch Adheres to Consulting with the Masses on Issues**

    The Party Branch of Ma Guanzhuang Management Area of Wang Guanzhuang People's Commune in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, attaches particular importance to the role of experienced farmers in leading agricultural production. The branch secretary, Cheng Youxing, and other five party cadres, respectively, invited twenty experienced old farmers from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds to be their consultants. The branch always consults with these old farmers on major production issues and relies on them to implement them among the masses. As a result, the production of this management area has been very successful, and grain production has increased year by year.

    **PLA Construction Unit Strengthens Political and Ideological Work**

    Under the encouragement of leading cadres going deep into the construction site to vigorously promote political and ideological work, a PLA unit undertaking construction tasks has consistently maintained high revolutionary drive. Now, they have overfulfilled the annual construction task by 51.5%.

    Since the start of construction, leading cadres at all levels have set an example by going deep into the ranks of soldiers and masses to do political and ideological work. Regimental Commander Sang Jinqiu, Deputy Political Commissar Ren Ruzhen, and other comrades often go to "squat" in the backward companies with the longest journeys and the most arduous tasks. They spend two-thirds of their time living on the construction site, earnestly helping the companies solve various practical problems, and promoting the continuous leap forward in construction.

Various medical and health units have established specialized institutions, sent medical and technical forces deep into various people's communes and areas, closely cooperated with street service stations, health workers, and courtyard health officers, and linked up with nurseries and kindergartens to publicize winter disease prevention knowledge to parents; and assist communes in improving disease prevention organizations.
