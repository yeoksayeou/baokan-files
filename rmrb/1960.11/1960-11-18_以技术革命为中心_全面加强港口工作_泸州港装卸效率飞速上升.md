    Focusing on Technological Revolution, Comprehensively Strengthening Port Work
    Luzhou Port's Loading and Unloading Efficiency Soars
    The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization reaches 92%. From January to October, the comprehensive efficiency of loading and unloading operations increased by 1.98 times compared to the same period last year.
    The port's cargo throughput has increased exponentially, while the required labor force has decreased. The time ships spend in port has been reduced from three days to no more than one day.
    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, November 17th) Luzhou Port in Sichuan Province, focusing on vigorously carrying out a technological revolution to improve loading and unloading efficiency, comprehensively strengthening port work, and greatly accelerating port ship turnaround. In the third quarter of this year, the comprehensive efficiency of loading and unloading operations increased by 1.2 times compared to the first quarter, and in October, it increased by another 36.8% compared to the third quarter. From January to October of this year, the comprehensive efficiency of loading and unloading operations increased by 1.98 times compared to the same period last year, and the time ships spent in port was reduced from three days to no more than one day. Based solely on the calculation of wooden boat transport capacity transiting through Luzhou Port from places like Fushun, Luxian, Naxi, and Neijiang, the transportation efficiency from January to October increased by 213% compared to the same period last year, equivalent to an increase of 15,011 tons of transport capacity, which means an additional 1,080,000 tons of materials can be transported annually.

    Luzhou Port is one of the main hubs of inland river transportation in Sichuan Province and also a transit port for the collection and distribution of large quantities of materials from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, with an annual throughput of over two million tons. With the new high tide of the national economy this year, import and export materials have increased exponentially. In order to accelerate port ship turnaround and ensure that grain, steel, and industrial and agricultural production materials are transported as soon as they arrive, the Luzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization of port loading and unloading last year, continued to deeply mobilize the masses to further develop, consolidate, and improve the already innovated loading and unloading machinery. The broad masses of workers, carrying forward the spirit of continuous revolution, adhered to the principle of focusing on local methods and combining local and foreign methods, and, based on the characteristics of the terrain and the direction of material flow, created loading and unloading tools such as iron chutes, bamboo and wooden chutes, and rope traction machines, and combined chutes, frame-type wheelbarrows, and other equipment into linked lines, greatly improving loading and unloading efficiency. For example, the use of rope traction machines for uphill materials has generally increased efficiency by more than five times. Currently, the port has built sixteen loading and unloading operation linked lines, and most materials are now handled without touching the ground, eliminating intermediate transfer links. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of port loading and unloading has increased from 68.5% in the first quarter to the current 92%. Because the innovated machinery has exerted tremendous power, this port has not only ensured that key materials are transported as soon as they arrive but has also changed the original plan to increase the labor force by 1,900 this year. From January to October of this year, it has also saved 578 laborers.

    In order to accelerate ship turnaround, Luzhou Port, while carrying out a technological innovation movement for loading and unloading, also strengthened port construction based on the original foundation, adapting to local conditions and using local materials, and further improved organization and management. This year, the port has renovated nine key docks and built and expanded six freight yards and a batch of warehouses, which alone has increased cargo capacity by about 24,000 tons. In terms of organization and management, command structures have been set up separately in key areas such as Lantian and Xiaoshi, and goods receiving registration has been established in larger freight yards. Loading and unloading points are planned uniformly according to the type of materials and the direction of flow, and corresponding responsibility systems are established. The average time for truck loading and unloading at the port has been reduced to no more than one minute per ton of cargo; wooden boat loading and unloading has achieved "boats don't wait overnight."

    In order to do a good job in port work and accelerate ship turnaround, Luzhou Port has also strengthened cooperation with relevant materials units and transportation departments under the special district and the city, and has established a system in which relevant departments forecast transport capacity and material conditions two days in advance. Transport capacity is balanced every day, and loading and unloading forces are arranged. Before this, the cooperation between various units was not close enough, and often 800 to 1,000 tons of wooden boat transport capacity could not be dispatched in a timely manner. After strengthening cooperation, since the third quarter, although the cargo throughput has increased month by month, the port has seen a new atmosphere of "boats don't travel empty, goods are not backlogged, no one waits for the other, quick loading and quick unloading."

### 以技术革命为中心  全面加强港口工作  泸州港装卸效率飞速上升

    以技术革命为中心  全面加强港口工作
    泸州港装卸效率飞速上升
    机械化半机械化程度达百分之九十二。一至十月装卸作业综合效率比去年同期提高一点九八倍。
    港口的货物吞吐量成倍增加，需用的劳动力反而减少。船舶停港时间由三天缩短到不超过一天。
    本报成都17日电　四川省泸州港以大搞技术革命提高装卸效率为中心，全面加强港口工作，大大加速了港口船舶周转。今年第三季度装卸作业的综合效率比第一季度提高一点二倍，10月份又比第三季度提高了36.8％。今年1至10月份的装卸作业综合效率比去年同期提高了一点九八倍，船舶在港作业时间由三天缩短为不超过一天。仅据富顺、泸县、纳溪、内江等地在泸州港中转的木船运力计算，1月至10月份运输效率就比去年同期提高了213％，相当于增加了一万五千零一十一吨运力，一年可多运物资一百零八万吨。
    泸州港是四川内河运输的主要枢纽之一，也是四川、云南、贵州三省大量物资集散的中转港，年吞吐量在二百万吨以上。随着今年国民经济的新高涨，进出口物资成倍增加。为了加快港口船舶周转，保证粮食、钢铁及工农业生产资料随到随运，中共泸州市委在去年大搞港口装卸机械化半机械化的基础上，继续深入发动群众，把已经革新的装卸机具再发展、再巩固、再提高。广大职工发扬了不断革命精神，坚持以土为主，土洋结合的方针，根据地形特点和物资流转方向，创造了铁梭槽、竹木梭槽、绳索牵引机等装卸工具，并把梭槽、架车式独轮车等组成联动线，大大提高了装卸效率。如上坡物资使用了绳索牵引机，一般都提高工效五倍以上。现在，全港已建成十六条装卸作业联动线，大部分物资已做到货不落地，消灭了中转环节。港口装卸机械化半机械化程度由第一季度的68.5％提高到目前的92％。由于革新机具发挥了巨大威力，这个港口不仅保证了重点物资随到随运，并且改变了今年原来准备增加一千九百名劳力的计划，今年1至10月还节约了五百七十八名劳动力。
    泸州港为了加速船舶周转，在开展装卸技术革新运动的同时，还因地制宜，就地取材，在原有基础上加强港口建设，并且进一步改进组织管理。今年全港已整修了九个重点码头，新建、扩建了六个货场和一批仓库，其中仅货物容量就增加了二万四千吨左右。在组织管理方面，对蓝田、小市等重点地区，分设了指挥机构，较大货场建立了收货登记，按照物资种类和流转方向，统一规划装卸点，建立相应的责任制度。全港汽车装卸时间已实现平均每吨货物不超过一分钟；木船装卸实现了船不过天。
    为了做好港口工作，加速船舶周转，泸州港还加强了同有关物资单位、专区和市属运输部门的协作，建立了由有关部门提前两天预报运力和物资情况的制度。每天平衡运力，安排装卸力量。在这以前，各单位配合不够密切，经常有八百吨到一千吨木船运力不能及时出港，加强协作以后，从第三季度以来，虽然物资吞吐量逐月增加，港口却出现了船不空行、货无积压、互不等待、快装快卸的新气象。（附图片）
