Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 1st: The Zhao Gezhuang Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine, a major supplier of coking coal to steel plants, organized over 1,200 pace-setters from across the mine to go to backward groups to provide extensive assistance. In just over a month, 60% of the backward groups in the mine caught up with the production levels of the advanced groups. The average daily output of raw coal in the entire mine increased by 6.4% in September compared to August, and from October 1st to 25th, it further increased by 9.5% compared to the same period in September.

    Organized, Planned, and Led
    Help the Backward, Learn from the Advanced, Catch Up with the Advanced

During the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, the CCP Kailuan Zhao Gezhuang Mine Committee paid close attention to group work. The political awareness and technical skills of most group workers were rapidly improved, and they reached advanced levels in production. However, there were still 10% of the groups whose production levels lagged significantly behind those of the advanced groups. Helping the backward catch up with the advanced could raise raw coal production to a new level. In response to this situation, the Party Committee decided to widely mobilize advanced pace-setters to carry out activities to help the backward groups improve their production levels. This measure was enthusiastically supported by pace-setters and the broad masses of workers, and a new upsurge in learning from and catching up with the advanced and extensively helping the backward quickly emerged.

In order to strengthen leadership over this work, the Secretary of the Mine Party Committee concurrently served as the Political Commissar of the "Thousand Pace-Setter Corps," and the Mine Director and Chairman of the Trade Union served as the Corps Leaders. Based on the special skills of the pace-setters in various types of work, forces were organized in a planned, led, and methodical manner to tackle key problems and promote advanced experiences. Before these pace-setters went to the backward groups, they understood and analyzed the ideological, technical, and key production issues of the backward groups. Then, a combination of voluntary application by the pace-setters and assignment by the leadership was adopted to allocate the pace-setters to various backward groups. Groups with weak political and ideological work were assigned pace-setters with high ideological levels to help them strengthen political and ideological work. Backward groups with low technical levels were assigned pace-setters with high technical skills to help them improve their operating methods. For groups undertaking critical tasks, a group of pace-setters with specialized technical skills was organized to help them complete their tasks. The pace-setters adopted the "five-package" method of being responsible for ideology, tasks, management, innovation, and life, to comprehensively improve the backward groups.
        
        Ideological Work Paves the Way
        Technical Measures Follow Up

After the pace-setter teams arrived in the backward groups, they strengthened the group's leadership and political and ideological work. They worked, consulted, and set examples alongside the workers in the backward groups, and made friends with the masses during the labor process. They used all available time, such as before and after shifts, to chat with the workers about their families, production, the situation, and tasks. They were widely welcomed by the masses. Gao Fengli, a pace-setter in the No. 73 Coal Mining Area, actively helped the group leader to do a good job in political and ideological work after arriving at the Hou Duanyang group. He often talked with the workers and visited the homes of veteran workers, enabling the workers in the entire group to recognize the current situation and understand the importance of increasing coal production to support steel production. This greatly stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for labor, actively learning and promoting advanced experiences, and the production outlook quickly changed. Since September, they have overfulfilled the production plan every day, and the average daily output of raw coal in the entire group has increased from more than 500 tons in August to more than 800 tons, winning the Red Banner for six consecutive ten-day periods. Lu Lianyou, a pace-setter and Communist Party member in the No. 41 Coal Mining Area, found that some workers believed that their group had low technical levels and poor production conditions after arriving at the Huihe Coal Mining Group, and they lacked confidence in striving for advancement and being the first. Based on this situation, Lu Lianyou, in addition to helping the group leader hold good group meetings and conduct "virtual" discussions, also adopted the method of "one key opens one lock" to address the different ideological problems existing among the new and old workers in the group, and organized the workers to vigorously innovate and solve the key problem of low coal mining recovery rate, quickly reversing the situation of not being able to complete the plan. Since mid-September, the average daily coal production has increased by more than 200 tons compared to the past.

    First Be a Student, Then Be a Teacher
    Listen, Observe, Research, and Help

After arriving in the backward groups, the pace-setters also adhered to the spirit of first being a student and then being a teacher. Based on the different key problems existing in the production of the backward groups, they spread their experiences and improved their operating techniques, which not only enabled many advanced experiences to be promoted quickly and well, but also made them sustainable. The main methods they adopted were "listen, observe, research, and help." "Listen" meant that after the pace-setters arrived in the backward groups, they first listened to the workers' opinions, understood the basic situation of the group, and discovered problems from it. "Observe" meant finding key production issues together with the workers during labor. "Research" meant analyzing and studying the problems and causes found, proposing improvement methods, and reaching a consensus. "Help" meant that the pace-setters helped the backward groups formulate measures and jointly tackle key production problems. For example, after Yang Fenglin, a pace-setter from the mining area, arrived at the No. 7132 Coal Mining Work Surface, he spread the experience of rapid prop installation, which increased the average prop installation efficiency of each person by two times, in response to the problem of low prop efficiency. On this basis, he also worked with veteran workers to study and boldly innovate the coal mining method, changing the longwall mining method to sectional mining, with nine tasks such as drilling, prop installation, and coal shoveling being carried out simultaneously, which not only fully utilized space and time and improved production efficiency, but also made production very safe. Since mid-October, the daily output of raw coal in this work surface has increased from more than 400 tons to more than 600 tons, despite a reduction of nearly half of the personnel. To date, 49 effective new technologies and advanced experiences have been widely promoted throughout the mine, and most groups have mastered one to nine advanced experiences, greatly improving production efficiency.

    Helping the Backward Changes Customs
    New Pace-Setters Constantly Emerge

These pace-setters also helped the backward groups improve their group management work, thereby fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of each worker. Huang Youhe, the leader of the tunneling group, had shortcomings in his working methods. After Kong Qinghong, the pace-setter group leader, came to this group, he helped him establish the idea of relying on the masses in everything. All the workers in the group worked together and quickly solved problems such as low tunneling efficiency and poor production preparation. Since September, the tunneling plan has been completed very well.

Through the mass campaign of advanced helping the backward, the number of backward groups in the entire mine has been reduced from the original 49 to 19, and more than 1,000 new pace-setters have emerged. The proportion of Red Banner groups has risen from the original 43.2% to 58.1%, and 80% of the groups complete or over fulfill the production plan every day.

    赵各庄煤矿千余标兵帮后进
    增产焦煤的四十九种新技术迅速推广　60％的后进组赶上先进
    据新华社天津1日电　大量供应钢厂焦煤的开滦煤矿赵各庄矿组织全矿一千二百多名标兵到后进小组去，大帮后进，短短一个多月，全矿60％的后进组赶上了先进组的生产水平。全矿的原煤平均日产量9月份比8月份提高6.4％，10月1日至25日又比9月同期提高9.5％。
    有组织有计划有领导
    帮后进学先进赶先进
    在增产节约运动中，中共开滦赵各庄矿委员会十分注意抓小组工作，绝大部分小组工人的政治思想觉悟和技术水平有了迅速提高，生产上达到了先进水平，但还有10％的小组与先进小组的生产水平悬殊较大。帮助后进赶上先进，就可以使原煤生产提高到一个新的水平。针对这种情况，党委决定广泛发动先进标兵开展帮助后进的活动，从全矿各个工种抽出一千二百多名标兵，组成标兵团到后进组去，帮助后进组提高生产水平。这一措施，得到全矿标兵和广大职工群众的热烈拥护，很快出现了一个学赶先进、大帮后进的竞赛新高潮。
    为了加强对这一工作的领导，由矿党委书记兼任“千人标兵团”政委，矿长、工会主席担任团长。根据各工种标兵的特长，有计划、有领导、有步骤地组织力量大攻关键，推广先进经验。这些标兵到后进组以前，对后进组的思想、技术和生产关键等情况都进行了了解和分析，然后采取标兵自愿报名和领导分配相结合的办法，把标兵分配到各个后进组。对政治思想工作薄弱的后进组，就配备了思想水平高的标兵，帮助他们加强政治思想工作。对技术水平低的后进组，就调配了技术水平高的标兵，帮助他们改进操作方法。对担负有关键任务的小组，就组织一批有技术专长的标兵，帮助他们完成任务。标兵到后进组，采取了包思想、包任务、包管理、包革新、包生活等“五包”办法，帮助后进小组全面提高。
        思想工作开路
        技术措施跟上
    标兵队伍到后进组以后，加强了小组领导力量和政治思想工作。他们同后进组工人同劳动，同商量，处处起模范、带头作用，并且在劳动过程中，广泛跟群众交知心朋友，利用班前、班后等一切可以利用的时间，跟工人一起叙家常，谈生产，讲形势，讲任务，受到群众的普遍欢迎。七三采煤区标兵高凤礼到侯端阳小组以后，积极帮助小组长作好政治思想工作，经常同工人谈心，到老工人家里访问，使全组工人认清当前形势，了解增产煤炭支援钢铁生产的重要意义，大大激发了工人的劳动热情，积极学习和推广先进经验，生产面貌迅速改观。9月份以来，天天超额完成生产计划，全组原煤平均日产量由8月份的五百多吨提高到八百多吨，并连续六旬获得红旗。四一采煤区标兵、共产党员鲁连友到惠合采煤小组以后，发现部分工人认为自己小组技术水平低、生产条件差，对于争先进、争第一的信心不足。根据这个情况，鲁连友除了帮助组长开好小组会议，进行“务虚”以外，并针对组内新老工人存在的不同思想问题，采取“一把钥匙开一把锁”的方法，进行个别谈心，同时组织工人大闹革新，解决采煤回收率低的关键问题，很快扭转了完不成计划的局面。9月中旬以来，平均每天产煤量比过去增加二百多吨。
    先当学生　后当先生
    一听二看　三研四帮
    标兵来到后进组以后，还本着先当学生，后当先生的精神，根据后进组生产上存在的不同关键问题来传播经验，改进操作技术，不仅使许多先进经验推广得又快又好，而且能够巩固。他们采取的主要办法是“一听、二看、三研、四帮”。“听”是标兵到后进组以后，首先听取工人意见，了解小组基本情况，从中发现问题。“看”是在劳动中，同工人一起找生产上的关键。“研”是把找出来的问题和原因，加以分析、研究，提出改进办法，取得一致意见。“帮”是标兵帮助后进组制定措施，围攻生产关键。例如矿区标兵杨凤林到七一三二采煤工作面以后，针对支柱效率低的问题，传播了快速支柱经验，平均每个人的支柱效率提高了二倍。在这个基础上，又同老工人一起研究，大胆革新采煤方法，把长壁式采煤法改为分段采煤法，打眼、支柱、攉煤等九种活儿一齐干，不但充分利用了空间和时间，提高了生产效率，而且生产也很安全。10月中旬以来，这个工作面在人员减少近一半的情况下，原煤日产量却由过去的四百多吨增加到六百多吨。到目前，全矿普遍推行了四十九种行之有效的新技术和先进经验，大部分小组掌握了一至九项先进经验，生产效率大大提高。
      帮后进移风易俗
      新标兵不断涌现
    这些标兵还帮助后进组改进了小组管理工作，从而充分调动了每个工人的积极性。掘进小组长黄有合工作方法有缺点，标兵组长孔庆红来到这个小组以后，帮助他树立了事事依靠群众的思想，全组工人同心协力，很快解决了掘进效率低、生产准备不好等问题，9月份以来，掘进计划完成得很好。
    通过开展先进帮后进的群众性活动，目前，全矿后进组由原来的四十九个减少到十九个，并涌现出一千多名新标兵。红旗组由原来的43.2％，上升到58.1％，有80％的小组天天完成或超额完成生产计划。
