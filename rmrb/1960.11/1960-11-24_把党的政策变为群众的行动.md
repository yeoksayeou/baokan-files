    Turning the Party's Policies into the Actions of the Masses
    Yang Shi
    Recently, all parts of the country have been further implementing the Party Central Committee's guiding principle of "Greatly developing agriculture, greatly developing grain production" and a series of policies. Although this action has only been underway for two or three months, the situation in the rural areas has immediately undergone great changes. Tens of millions of laborers have returned to the agricultural production front, and hundreds of thousands of cadres have gone to the countryside to strengthen the leadership of the people's communes, production brigades, production teams, and public canteens. The arrival of cadres in the countryside and the return of laborers to the countryside have brought the Party's guidelines and policies to the rural areas, which have been wholeheartedly supported by the vast number of rural grassroots cadres and people's commune members. They said, "The Party's guidelines are good guidelines, the policies are good policies," "Every article is agreeable, every sentence is pleasing." Some areas, despite encountering severe attacks from natural disasters this year, have seen the Party's guidelines and policies acting as a fiercely burning torch, illuminating people's path forward and allowing them to see a bright future. At present, the broad masses are throwing themselves into production with soaring enthusiasm, striving to win the victory of winter production this year, and especially for the victory of production throughout next year.
    To further develop the current excellent situation, to more fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, and to make it consolidate and continue to surge forward, much more work needs to be done. The most important link is to thoroughly implement the policies, to hand over the policies to the masses, and to truly make them the conscious actions of the broad masses.
    Policies must reach the bottom. Where is this bottom? Some say, "The bottom is in the people's commune, because the commune is the basic unit that combines government and society, a unified whole." Others say, "The bottom is in the production brigade (production team), because the brigade (team) is the basic accounting unit of the commune, and the commune's three-level ownership system is currently based on the brigade (team)." That's not right. The bottom should be in the production team, among the broad masses. Although the production team is not the basic accounting unit, it is the most basic unit that specifically organizes the masses for production because it is the unit responsible for contracted output; and because the canteens are mostly established according to the scope of the team, it is also the most basic unit that specifically organizes people's lives. If the Party's policies are not carried out directly to the team, do not directly meet with the masses, and are not specifically reflected in the team's production, management, and life, then it cannot be said that the policies have reached the bottom. And if the policies do not reach the bottom and cannot be transformed into the actions of the masses, then even the best policies are just empty words and will not be of any use.
    Is it enough for only the cadres to understand the Party's policies, without the need for the broad masses to grasp them? Of course not. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Policy and tactics are the life of the Party,"① "Policy is the starting point of all actual actions of a revolutionary party, and is manifested in the process and end of action."② Our Party's policies are the action guide for the Party to lead the people in carrying out class struggle and production struggle. Whether policies reach the bottom and whether they are transformed into the actions of the masses is a Marxist-Leninist art of leadership, the dividing line between whether our work commits errors or not. If we examine our work, we can find that any achievements we have made are the result of correctly implementing the Party's policies and turning them into the actions of the masses; conversely, some of the shortcomings and even errors that have occurred in our work are often directly related to not paying attention to policies or even violating them.
    How can policies be thoroughly implemented? This requires cadres to do a series of meticulous and arduous tasks. Cadres are the link and bridge between the Party and the masses; the Party's policies rely on cadres to implement them, and the opinions of the masses rely on cadres to reflect them. The formulation and implementation of our Party's policies is a process of "from the masses, to the masses," and this process is realized through the hard work of cadres. The wishes of millions of people are reflected to the Party through cadres, forming the Party's policies; the Party's policies are then implemented to the masses through cadres, becoming the actions of the masses. Therefore, it is of great significance to ensure that cadres have a high degree of policy awareness and can treat the Party's policies with a serious attitude for doing good work and ensuring the smooth development of the revolution and construction.
    Whether to treat the Party's policies seriously or not mainly depends on whether to implement the Party's policies completely and without discount, and whether to resolutely and thoroughly implement the policies into practical work. To achieve this, it is necessary to oppose two phenomena: one phenomenon is to regard policies as "expedient measures" to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, believing that as long as the policies are publicized among the masses and the masses are mobilized, the goal is achieved, and it is not necessary to act 100% in accordance with the policies. This kind of thinking and practice is of course extremely wrong. Our Party's policies are the guide for the actions of the broad masses. The masses welcome and support the Party's policies not because they are good-looking or good-sounding, but because they are useful and are the blueprint for the masses to create their own beautiful lives. Sticking to verbally implementing policies without translating them into action will seriously dampen the enthusiasm of the masses and is extremely detrimental to the current movement, and therefore must be resolutely opposed. Another phenomenon is to take policies out of context in the process of implementing the Party's policies, arbitrarily interpret policies, and select policies according to one's own needs or even according to personal interests, implementing those that are pleasing and not implementing those that are not pleasing. This kind of randomness and lack of organization and discipline in dealing with policies is even more very wrong. Our Party's policies represent the interests of the people and reflect the demands and wishes of the people, and therefore have a high degree of seriousness. If the Party's policies are not correctly publicized and implemented, it is actually implementing another incorrect policy, which will undermine the Party's unified will and unified action. The losses caused by this practice in work are unimaginable. Therefore, seriously and conscientiously treating the Party's policies and faithfully implementing the Party's policies are the greatest Party spirit and revolutionary spirit of Communist Party members and all revolutionary cadres. Even before the national liberation, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly taught us to fight against this phenomenon. He said, "It is necessary to resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchy that exists in many places, that is, to arbitrarily revise the policies and tactics of the Central Committee or the higher party committee, and to implement extremely harmful policies and tactics that they think are in line with their own ideas and violate the unified will and unified discipline; under the pretext of being busy with work, adopt the wrong attitude of not asking for instructions beforehand and not reporting afterwards, and regard the places they manage as if they were an independent country. This state of affairs is extremely harmful to the interests of the revolution."③ If, at that time, on the eve of our Party's seizure of national power, the success or failure of the Party's policies was directly related to whether the revolution could rapidly achieve victory on a national scale, and therefore had extremely important significance; then today, when our Party has become the ruling party nationwide, our Party's policies are related to the development of socialist construction, and in terms of the Party's current rural policies, related to the consolidation of rural people's communes and related to the production and life of millions of people, this significance is even more prominent, and requires us to seriously and conscientiously act in accordance with the Party's policies.
    In the process of implementing policies, many arduous and meticulous tasks must be done. The practice of only reading the superior's policy regulations verbatim and then not following up on how to specifically implement them in one's own commune, brigade, or team is undesirable and is an irresponsible behavior towards the cause of the Party and the people. Implementing policies in this way will inevitably cause the policies to fall through. Since policies are the guide for the actions of the masses, they must enable the masses to do things one by one according to them. And the situations in various places cannot be exactly the same, so when policies reach the commune, especially the brigade and team, they should not simply copy the general regulations of the superior, but should combine them with the current local situation to turn them into specific measures. For example, the policies of "three guarantees" and "four fixings" must have specific plans in the brigade and team. How to clean up the remaining problems of the "three guarantees" if they have not been cleaned up? Which teams should be rewarded? Which teams should be punished? How to implement them if they have not been implemented? How many indicators should be stipulated to be both active and reliable? On the basis of implementing the "three guarantees," how should the movement to exceed area, exceed output, and save investment be carried out? And so on, all must be resolved item by item. The same is true for "four fixings." The brigade should fix the labor force, cultivated land, cattle, and farm tools of the team, and the team should strengthen the work organization and improve the production responsibility system through the consolidation of labor organizations. Which field belongs to which team to plant, which group to manage? Which cow belongs to which group to use, which group to raise? There must be clear regulations. Only in this way can we achieve dedicated management of fields, dedicated responsibility of people, dedicated raising of cattle, and dedicated use of farm tools, with clear tasks and clear responsibilities. This cannot be solved by swallowing dates whole and imitating without understanding, but must rely closely on the masses and carry out many practical and meticulous tasks.
    It can be seen that implementing the Party's policies is a struggle between two ideologies and two work styles for cadres. The ideology and work style of cadres is the key to the success or failure of policy implementation. Is it really doing what is said, acting vigorously and swiftly implementing the Party's policies, or is it only talking without doing, procrastinating, making policies only become words on the lips? Is it really correctly, comprehensively, and without discount implementing the Party's policies, or is it implementing the Party's policies conditionally and with reservations? Is it really relying on the masses to implement policies, or is it relying on the issuance of orders by individuals to implement policies? The ideology and work style of each cadre will be strictly tested here. And the responsibility of leaders at all levels lies in helping cadres earnestly study policies, draw clear lines, arm their minds, and rectify their work styles with the greatest enthusiasm and care, and through the implementation of policies, greatly improve the ideological understanding, work style, and work methods of all cadres.
    It is certainly very important to carry out policies to the very end, so that the masses all know and understand them, but it is only the first step. Then it is necessary to make the policies come true. Only when the policies are fulfilled can we win the trust of the people and truly mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. Because our society is in a constant state of change, in the short eleven years since liberation, it has gone through several stages, and it is inevitable that some policies will continue to develop with the changes in the situation, so some of the masses do not fully understand certain policies of the Party at this stage. This requires us not only to emphasize publicizing the Party's policies, but also to emphasize fulfilling the policies. Fulfilling policies is the best publicity. Some policies should be publicized while taking action. Some can be done after speaking, and some policy legacy issues should even be done before speaking. The purpose is to reflect the policy spirit and more fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. For example, strengthening the agricultural production front line, fixing the rural labor force; clearing up the rewards and punishments for the implementation of the "three guarantees"; acknowledging differences, strictly implementing the distribution system combining the supply system and the wage system based on distribution according to work, etc., are all good policies that reflect the current and long-term interests of the masses and are warmly supported by the masses; and when the masses hear the thunder and see the rain, see the determination of the leadership, and see the bright future, they will exert even greater power to push our construction cause to a new climax.

    把党的政策变为群众的行动
    杨石
    最近全国各地都在进一步贯彻执行党中央提出的“大办农业、大办粮食”的方针和一系列的政策。这一行动虽然还只进行了两三个月，但是农村形势立即起了很大的变化。数以千万计的劳动力回到了农业生产战线，数以百万计的干部下到农村，加强了人民公社、生产大队、生产小队和公共食堂的领导。干部来到农村，劳动力回到农村，也就把党的方针政策带到了农村，得到广大农村基层干部和人民公社社员的衷心拥护。他们说：“党的方针是好方针，政策是好政策”，“条条合意，句句顺心”。一些地区尽管今年遭遇到自然灾害的严重袭击，但是党的方针政策是烈焰熊熊的火炬，照亮了人们前进的道路，使人们看到一派光明的前景。目前广大群众正以高涨的热情投入生产，为夺取今年冬季生产、特别是为夺取明年全年生产的胜利而斗争。
    要进一步发展当前的大好形势，更充分地调动起群众的积极性，并且使之巩固地、持续地高涨下去，还要做许多工作。其中最重要的一环，就是要把政策贯彻到底，把政策交给群众，使之真正成为广大群众的自觉行动。
    政策必须到底。这个底在哪里？有人说，“这个底在人民公社，因为公社是政社合一的基层单位，是个统一体。”也有人说，“这个底在生产大队（生产队），因为大队（队）是公社的基本核算单位，目前公社的三级所有制是以大队（队）为基础的。”不对。这个底应当在生产小队，在广大的群众之中。生产小队虽然不是基本核算单位；但由于它是包产单位，因而是具体组织群众进行生产的最基层单位；又由于食堂多数按照小队的范围建立，因而它又是具体组织人民生活的最基层单位。如果党的政策不一竿子插到小队，不同群众直接见面，不具体体现在小队的生产、管理和生活之中，就不能说政策已经到底。而政策如果不到底，不能变成群众的行动，那末即使是再好不过的政策，也只是一纸具文，不会有什么用处。
    党的政策是否只要干部懂得而不必为广大群众所掌握就可以呢？当然不行。毛泽东同志说：“政策和策略是党的生命”①，“政策是革命政党一切实际行动的出发点，并且表现于行动的过程和归宿”②。我们党的政策是党领导人民群众进行阶级斗争和生产斗争的行动指南。政策是否到底，是否变为群众的行动，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术，是我们的工作犯不犯错误的界限所在。如果检查一下我们的工作，就可以发现，我们取得的任何成绩，都是正确地贯彻执行了党的政策，把政策变成群众行动的结果；反之，我们在工作中所发生的一些缺点以至错误，往往都同不讲究政策以至违反政策是有直接的关系。
    怎样才能使政策贯彻到底呢？这就需要干部做一系列细致的艰苦的工作。干部是党和群众之间的纽带和桥梁，党的政策要依靠干部去贯彻，群众的意见要依靠干部来反映。我们党的政策的制定和执行，是一个由群众中来、到群众中去的过程，这个过程是由干部的辛勤工作来实现的。千百万群众的愿望通过干部反映到党内来，形成了党的政策；党的政策又通过干部贯彻到群众中去，变成群众的行动。因此，使干部都具有高度的政策观点，都能用严肃的态度对待党的政策，对于做好工作，对于保证革命和建设事业的顺利发展，就具有十分重要的意义。
    是不是严肃地对待党的政策，最主要的就是要看是不是全部地、不折不扣地执行党的政策，是不是坚决彻底地把政策贯彻到实际工作中去。为了做到这一点，就必须反对两种现象：一种现象是把政策当作调动群众积极性的“权宜之计”，认为只要在群众中宣传了政策，把群众发动起来，目的就算达到了，不一定要百分之百地按照政策办事。这种想法和做法当然是极其错误的。我们党的政策是广大群众行动的指南。群众欢迎党的政策，拥护党的政策，绝不是因为它好看、好听，而是因为它有用，是群众据以创造自己的美好生活的蓝图。把政策的贯彻执行停留在口头上而不见诸行动，将会严重地挫伤群众的积极性，对当前运动是极其不利的，因而必须坚决反对。另一种现象是在贯彻执行党的政策的过程中断章取义，任意解释政策，根据自己的需要甚至根据个人的利益去选择政策，拣合心意的贯彻，不合心意的就不贯彻。这种对待政策的随意性和无组织无纪律的态度，更是非常错误的。我们党的政策代表着人民的利益，反映着人民的要求和愿望，因而有着高度的严肃性。如果不是正确地宣传、贯彻党的政策，就是在实际上执行着另一种不正确的政策，就会破坏党的统一意志和统一行动。这种作法在工作中造成的损失是难以设想的。因此，严肃认真地对待党的政策，忠实地执行党的政策，这是共产党员以及一切革命干部的最大的党性和革命性。还在全国解放之前，毛泽东同志就一再教导我们要同这种现象作斗争。他说“必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态，即擅自修改中央的或上级党委的政策和策略，执行他们自以为是的违背统一意志和统一纪律的极端有害的政策和策略；在工作繁忙的借口之下，采取事前不请示事后不报告的错误态度，将自己管理的地方，看成好像一个独立国。这种状态，给予革命利益的损害，极为巨大”。③毛泽东同志的这一段话，如果说在当时，在我党取得全国政权的前夜，由于党的政策贯彻得好与不好，直接关系着革命是否能够迅速取得全国规模的胜利，因而具有极端重要的意义；那么在今天，当我们党已经成为全国范围的执政党，我们党的政策就关系着社会主义建设的发展，就党在目前的农村政策来说，关系着农村人民公社的巩固和，关系着千百万人民群众的生产和生活的情况下，这个意义就更加突出，更加要求我们严肃认真地按照党的政策办事。
    在贯彻执行政策过程中，必须做许多艰苦细致的工作。那种只把上级的政策规定照本宣读一遍，至于自己这个公社、大队或小队如何具体贯彻执行却没有下文的做法，是要不得的，是对党和人民的事业不负责任的行为。这样贯彻政策，必然要使政策落空。政策既然是群众的行动指南，就必须使群众能够一件件照着做。而各个地方的情况又不可能完全一样，因此，政策到了公社、特别是到了大队和小队，就不能照搬上级的一般规定，应当结合当时当地的情况，使它变为一项项具体措施。比如，“三包”和“四固定”的政策，在大队和小队就必须有具体规划。“三包”遗留的问题，没有清理的如何清理？哪些队该奖？哪些队该罚？没有落实的如何落实？指标该规定多少才算既积极又可靠？在落实“三包”的基础上，应当怎样开展超面积、超产量、节约投资的运动？等等，都必须逐项解决。“四固定”也是如此。大队应当把小队的劳动力、耕地、耕牛、农具固定下来，小队内部应当通过劳动组织的整顿，健全作业小组，健全生产责任制。哪块田归哪一队种、哪一组管？哪头牛归哪一组使、哪一组养？都必须有明确规定。只有这样才能做到田有专管，人有专责，牛有专养，农具有专用，任务明确，责任分明。这就不是囫囵吞枣、依葫芦画瓢所能解决的，而必须紧紧地依靠群众，进行许多切实细致的工作。
    由此可见，贯彻执行党的政策对干部说来是一场两种思想、两种作风的斗争。干部的思想作风，是政策贯彻执行得好坏的关键。究竟是说了就做，雷厉风行，迅速执行党的政策，还是光说不做，拖拖拉拉，使政策只成为挂在嘴上的条文？究竟是正确地、全面地、不折不扣地贯彻执行党的政策，还是有条件、有保留地执行党的政策？究竟是依靠群众来贯彻执行政策，还是依靠个人的发号施令来执行政策？每个干部的思想作风，都将在这里受到严格的检验。而各级领导的责任就在于用最大的热情和关心，帮助干部认真学习政策，划清界限，武装思想，整顿作风，通过政策的贯彻，把全体干部的思想认识、工作作风和工作方法大大提高一步。
    把政策一竿子插到底，使群众都知道，都懂得，这固然十分重要，但还只是走了第一步，紧接着就要使政策兑现。只有政策兑现了，才能取信于民，真正把群众的积极性调动起来。由于我们的社会处在不断的变革之中，在解放以来的短短十一年中，就经历了好几个阶段，一部分政策随着形势的变化必然不断发展，因而一些群众对现阶段党的某些政策不十分了解，这是难以避免的。这就要求我们不只要强调宣传党的政策，而且要强调兑现政策。兑现政策是最好的宣传。有些政策，应该是一边宣传，一边行动。有些可以先讲后做，有些政策遗留问题甚至要先做后讲，其目的都是为了体现政策精神，更充分地调动群众的积极性。例如，加强农业生产第一线，固定农村劳动力；清理“三包”执行赏罚；承认差别，严格执行以按劳分配为基础的供给制与工资制相结合的分配制度，等等，都是体现了群众的当前利益和长远利益而为群众所热烈拥护的好政策；而当群众听到行雷，又看到下雨，看到领导的决心，看到光明的前景时，他们就会发挥出更加伟大的力量，把我们的建设事业推上一个新的高潮。
