Xinhua News Agency, Managua, 16th: News from Managua, the capital of Nicaragua: Recently, another armed action against the Somoza dictatorship has erupted in Nicaragua. On the 11th, a group of anti-dictatorial armed personnel launched a surprise attack and occupied the city of Jinotepe, 40 kilometers south of Managua, and the neighboring city of Diriamba (both in the province of Carazo). At the same time, a group of Nicaraguan armed personnel opposing Somoza, operating on the border between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, also began attacking the Nicaraguan hinterland.

According to a Latin American News Agency report from San José on the 14th, hundreds of anti-dictatorial armed personnel had occupied the Colegio in Diriamba. This armed force also captured the commander of the National Guard in the Carazo region and two other Somoza officers.

The dictator Somoza hurriedly declared a state of martial law throughout the country on the evening of the 11th, and ordered the Nicaraguan National Guard to blockade all roads leading to Managua, and dispatched troops equipped with tanks to rush to the aid of Carazo Province. Anastasio Somoza, the dictator's brother and commander of the armed forces, who was visiting the United States, rushed back to the country to suppress the anti-dictatorial military action.

After the outbreak of this incident, the Somoza regime falsely accused the Cuban government of participating in this anti-dictatorial armed action by Nicaraguans, and the American news agencies also took the opportunity to publicize it, attempting to create an excuse for the US's long-planned conspiracy to interfere in Cuba.

It can be seen from various reports that the pro-American dictatorial regime in Nicaragua is becoming increasingly unstable, and the people's resistance is rising. The worker and mass movements are developing. Recently, many mass organizations have been established, and their goal is to fight to change the status quo, to eliminate the forces of US imperialism, and to realize democratic reforms. One of the largest organizations is the "Patriotic Youth" organization, which has several thousand college students, young workers, peasants, and petty-bourgeois youths.

    尼加拉瓜反独裁武装进行突袭
    占领城镇数座俘掳克拉索地区国民警卫队司令
    索摩查政权宣布全国戒严加派援军前往镇压
    新华社16日讯　尼加拉瓜首都马那瓜消息：最近，尼加拉瓜又爆发了一次反对索摩查独裁统治的武装行动。一部分反独裁的武装人员在11日发动了突然袭击，占领了马那瓜以南四十公里的希诺特佩城和邻近的迪里亚姆巴城（都在克拉索省）。与此同时，在尼加拉瓜和哥斯达黎加边境活动的一批反对索摩查的尼加拉瓜武装人员也开始向尼加拉瓜内地进行袭击。
    据拉丁美洲通讯社圣约瑟14日消息说，数百名反独裁武装人员曾经占据迪里亚姆巴的克莱希奥。这批武装力量还俘掳了克拉索地区国民警卫队司令和另外两名索摩查的军官。
    独裁者索摩查在11日当晚急忙宣布全国处于戒严状态，同时下令尼加拉瓜国民警卫队封锁所有通往马那瓜的道路，并派遣配备有坦克的部队驰援克拉索省。正在访问美国的独裁者的兄弟、武装部队司令安纳斯塔西奥·索摩查，为了镇压反独裁的军事行动，急忙赶回国内。
    在这次事件爆发后，索摩查政权诬赖古巴政府参与这次尼加拉瓜人的反独裁武装行动，美国通讯社也趁机大肆宣传，企图为美国一直在策划的干涉古巴阴谋制造借口。
    从各方面的报道中可以看出，尼加拉瓜亲美独裁政权日益不稳，国内人民的反抗情绪正在高涨。工人和群众运动都在发展。最近成立了许多群众性组织，它们的目标是为改变现状、为消灭美帝国主义的势力和实现民主改革而斗争。其中一个最大的组织是“爱国青年”组织，加入这个组织的有好几千名大学生、青年工人、农民和小资产阶级青年。
