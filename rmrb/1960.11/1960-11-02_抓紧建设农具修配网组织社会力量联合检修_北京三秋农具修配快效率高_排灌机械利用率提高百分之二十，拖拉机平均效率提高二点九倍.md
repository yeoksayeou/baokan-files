    (本报讯) Beijing Municipality, while strengthening agricultural technical equipment, is vigorously grasping the repair and fitting of agricultural machinery to enable agricultural machinery to play a better role in production. Since the beginning of the "Three Autumns" season, the city has repaired more than 1,300 units of "Three Autumns" farm implements such as tractor-drawn weeding harrows, animal-drawn weeding harrows, wheat sowing machines, power threshers, and tractors, and has quickly transported them to the countryside.

    In order to lay a good foundation for repair and fitting work, Beijing Municipality has vigorously grasped the construction of agricultural machinery repair and fitting networks in carrying out the repair and fitting campaign. Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and after more than half a year of efforts, the suburban areas of the city have built a preliminary agricultural machinery repair and fitting system: of the sixty-seven people's communes in the suburban areas of the city, fifty-one communes have repair and fitting factories, each management area has repair and fitting stations and workshops, and each production team has repair and fitting groups. Most of these repair and fitting factories, stations, and groups can repair transportation machinery and irrigation and drainage machinery as soon as they arrive, and repair them locally. The repair and fitting factories of the eight people's communes in Tongxian County and the ten people's communes of Chaoyang, Heping, Shahe, and Hongxing in the vicinity of Beijing can already repair large equipment such as tractors and diesel engines without leaving the people's commune. Due to timely repair and fitting, the effectiveness of various agricultural machines put into production has been significantly improved. According to statistics, the utilization rate of irrigation and drainage machinery in the suburbs has increased from about 50% to about 70%, and the highest has reached more than 90%. Because tractors in the suburbs have been strengthened in repair, the average efficiency of each tractor in the first half of this year increased by 2.9 times compared with the same period last year. The same number of sowing machines as last year, simply because of strengthened repairs, sowed more than 370,000 mu in the first half of this year, equivalent to 2.5 times the sowing area last year.

    In addition to giving full play to internal potential to ensure regular repair and fitting, agricultural machinery repair and fitting units also organize joint overhauls in a planned way before the arrival of the sowing and harvesting seasons, according to the characteristics of agricultural production. The organization of joint repair and fitting, under the unified leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, organizes agricultural machinery repair and fitting factories and communes to carry out factory-commune hook-ups, comprehensively considers the city's agricultural machinery repair and fitting tasks, and uniformly arranges forces. Before the autumn overhaul, there were 448 kinds of spare parts and 220,000 pieces lacking for repairing tractors in the suburbs, and many parts could not be manufactured by agricultural machinery repair and fitting factories. Due to the above-mentioned methods, the city not only quickly trial-produced new products such as track plates and pistons, but also made more than 200 kinds of spare parts, more than 100,000 pieces, that had not been made before. At the same time, it also mobilized and organized all social forces to support agricultural implement repair and fitting. A group of staff from the financial and trade system formed procurement and supply parts groups to support the repair and fitting of the communes for a long time. Various universities and colleges also sent a large number of students to the communes to support agricultural machinery repair and fitting. In the first eight months of this year, the students repaired 2,109 units of transportation machinery, irrigation and drainage machinery, and large agricultural machinery, and more than 47,000 pieces of various small farm implements for the communes. Students from Tsinghua University helped Yongfeng Commune in Haidian build a repair and fitting factory with the capacity to repair 100 tractors a year, and more than 1,000 students from Beijing Mining College were sent to the communes to teach repair and fitting techniques. These supports have powerfully promoted agricultural machinery repair and fitting work.

    抓紧建设农具修配网组织社会力量联合检修
    北京三秋农具修配快效率高
    排灌机械利用率提高百分之二十，拖拉机平均效率提高二点九倍
    本报讯　北京市在加强农业技术装备的同时，狠抓农业机械修配工作，使农业机械在生产中更好地发挥作用。在三秋开始后，全市已修好“三秋”农具机引丁齿、畜力丁齿、小麦播种机、动力打谷机、拖拉机等一千三百多部，并迅速运往农村。
    为了使修配工作打下良好的基础，北京市在开展修配运动中狠抓农机修配网的建设。在中共北京市委的领导下，经过半年多的努力，全市郊区已经建成了一个初具规模的农业机械修配体系：全市郊区六十七个人民公社，有五十一个公社有了修配厂，每个管理区有修配站、车间，每个生产队都有修配小组。这些修配厂、站和小组，大部分做到了运输机械、排灌机械随到随修，就地修理，北京近郊区通县的八个人民公社和朝阳、和平、沙河、红星等十个人民公社的修配厂，已经做到拖拉机、柴油机等大型设备的修理不出人民公社。由于修配及时，投入生产的各种农业机械的效用，都显著提高。据统计，全郊区排灌机械的利用率，已由50％左右提高到70％左右，最高的已达到90％以上。全郊区的拖拉机因为加强了修理，今年上半年，平均每台效率，比去年同期提高了二点九倍。和去年同样数量的播种机，仅仅因为加强了修理，在今年上半年播种了三十七万多亩。相当于去年播种面积的二点五倍。
    农业机械修配各单位，除了充分发挥内部潜力，保证经常性的修配外，并根据农业生产的特点，在播种和收割季节到来之前，有计划地组织联合检修。组织联合修配，是在中共北京市委的统一领导下，组织农业机械修配各厂和公社进行厂社挂钩的各厂，通盘考虑全市农业机械修配任务，统一安排力量。在秋前大检修时，全郊区缺少修拖拉机的配件有四百四十八种，二十二万件，很多部件，农业机械修配厂无法制造。由于采取了上述办法，全市不但很快试制出练轨板、活塞等新产品，而且制做了没有制做过的配件二百多种、十万多件。在这同时，还动员和组织一切社会力量支援农具修配。财贸系统一批职工组成采购供应配件小组，长期支援公社的修配。各高等学校也派出大批学生到公社支援农业机械修配，今年前八个月中，学生们为公社修复了运输机械、排灌机械和大型农业机械二千一百零九台，各种小农具四万七千多件。清华大学的学生帮助海淀永丰公社建设了一座年修一百台拖拉机能力的修配厂，北京矿业学院派出一千多学生到公社传授修配技术。这些支援，都有力地推动了农业机械修配工作。
