    Adenauer's Probe
    (Reported by this newspaper) West German political circles have recently been buzzing with rumors of possible talks between West Germany and the Soviet Union. According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur report on the 12th, Adenauer said when meeting with reporters from Essen's "Neue Ruhr Zeitung" on the 12th, "I have been to Moscow, now it is time for Khrushchev to consider coming to Bonn." Adenauer also said, "I believe talks with Khrushchev are possible."
    On the 15th, West German government spokesman Eckardt issued a statement to the press, further pointing out that the invitation to visit extended to Khrushchev by Adenauer during his visit to Moscow in 1955 "remains valid." He also said, "Bonn would be an appropriate place for the Soviet Union to return the visit."
    The West German "Frankfurter Neue Presse" commented on Adenauer's remarks on the 14th, considering it a "trial balloon" to the Soviet Union. A Reuters report from Bonn on the 12th pointed out that Adenauer's "markedly changed tone" on relations with the Soviet Union was hoping to "gain capital" in talks with Khrushchev before the West German elections next summer.

    阿登纳的试探
    本报讯　西德政界最近传闻着西德可能和苏联举行会谈的消息。据德意志新闻社12日报道，阿登纳在12日接见埃森“新鲁尔报”记者时说，“我已经到过莫斯科，现在该是赫鲁晓夫考虑到波恩来的时候了。”阿登纳并且说，“我相信同赫鲁晓夫会谈是有可能的。”
    15日，西德政府发言人埃卡特对报界发表声明，进一步指出，阿登纳在1955年访问莫斯科时向赫鲁晓夫发出的访问邀请“仍然有效”。他还说，“波恩将是苏联作回访的适当地方。”
    西德“法兰克福新报”14日在评论阿登纳的谈话时认为，这是他对苏联的一个“试探气球”。路透社12日从波恩发出的报道指出，阿登纳在对苏联关系上的“语调明显改变”，是希望在明年夏天西德选举之前，在同赫鲁晓夫的会谈中“捞取资本”。
