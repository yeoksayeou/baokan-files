Relying on the Masses to Manufacture Locally; Plan Early and Purchase in a Timely Manner
Datuan Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative Basically Prepares Spring Farming Production Materials

(Our newspaper, Shanghai, 13th dispatch) The Datuan Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Nanhui County, Shanghai, is preparing early for the production materials needed for this winter and next spring, achieving "before the troops move, the supplies go first," ensuring that the supply of materials precedes the agricultural season. At present, this supply and marketing cooperative has basically prepared all kinds of materials needed for the entire commune's winter production this year and spring plowing and sowing next year, such as agricultural tools, hardware equipment, and machinery parts.

As soon as the "Three Autumns" began, this supply and marketing cooperative, under the leadership of the commune Party committee, investigated and studied the needs of agricultural production this winter and next spring; then, it began to organize sources of goods.

When preparing production materials for this winter and next spring, the Datuan Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative first adhered to the spirit of self-reliance and relied on the commune members to manufacture locally. For general agricultural tools, fertilizers, and pesticides, they cooperated with the production teams and adopted six methods of "local," "substitute," "recycle," "repair," "modify," and "adjust" to solve the problems. "Local" means local production using indigenous methods, using local resources instead of foreign ones. For example, manufacturing local fertilizer and local pesticides. "Substitute" means obtaining materials locally and using substitutes. For example, using rice straw, thorny tree bark, and yellow vine instead of bamboo to make baskets. "Recycle" means recovering and utilizing waste materials. "Repair" means repairing damaged equipment.
  "Modify" means changing large to small, long to short, and thick to thin, converting non-standard items into usable ones. "Adjust" means organizing production teams to adjust to each other according to the principle of equal value exchange and to share what they have. Commercial personnel acted as advisors, offering ideas, and actively participating in manufacturing and repair activities. They helped the production teams arrange their "Three Autumns" labor force and transferred some bamboo craftsmen and carpenters to establish repair stations in the teams, forming a repair network with the supply and marketing cooperative's repair shops and the commune's agricultural tool factory; the supply and marketing cooperative also sent people to the countryside for mobile repairs. In just one month, they recovered, modified, and repaired more than ten kinds of agricultural tools needed for this winter and next spring, such as baskets, triangular plows, wooden plows, hoes, and waterwheels, totaling more than 4,400 pieces. The supply and marketing cooperative also did its best to help the commune's hardware machinery factory to process and manufacture agricultural machinery accessories and parts by themselves. Now, they have successfully manufactured seven kinds of special specifications accessories such as Hailituo pistons and cylinder screws, and prepared enough accessories for the commune's five models of rare diesel engines.

At the same time, the supply and marketing cooperative also promptly organized the purchase of goods from relevant parties. Salesmen worked with agricultural machinery users to carefully plan and formulate purchase plans, ensuring that the types, specifications, and quantities of purchased accessories met actual needs. At present, they have purchased more than 8,000 yuan worth of accessories and parts for agricultural machinery such as tractors, water pumps, and internal combustion engines, more than 40,000 pieces of items such as bamboo poles and carrying poles, and some bamboo and wood materials, lead wire, and round nails for repairing and manufacturing agricultural tools, basically stocking up on production materials that the commune cannot solve on its own.

At present, the Datuan Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative is continuing to organize sources of goods while allocating some bamboo and wood agricultural tools to the production teams in advance.

    依靠群众就地制造　早定计划及时进货
    大团公社供销部基本备好春耕生产资料
    本报上海13日电　上海市南汇县大团公社供销部及早准备今冬明春需要的生产资料，做到“兵马未动，粮草先行”，物资供应赶在农时前面。目前，这个供销部已经基本上备好了全公社今年冬季生产和明年春耕春播需要的农具、五金器材、机械配件等各种物资。
    “三秋”刚刚开始，这个供销部就在公社党委的领导下调查研究了今冬明春农业生产的需要；接着，就动手组织货源。
    大团公社供销部在准备今冬明春生产资料时，首先本着自力更生的精神，依靠社员就地制造。一般农具、肥料、农药，他们都和生产队协作，采取“土”、“代”、“回”、“修”、“改”、“调”等六种办法解决。“土”是土法生产，以土代洋。例如制造土化肥、土农药。“代”是就地取材，采用代用品。如以稻草、荆树皮、黄生藤代替竹子做畚箕等。“回”是回收利用废旧物资。“修”是修补残旧器材。
  “改”是大改小、长改短、粗改细，把不合规格的东西改制成合用的。“调”是组织生产队按照等价交换的原则互相调剂，互通有无。商业人员一面当参谋，出主意，一面积极投入制造、修配活动。他们帮助生产队安排好“三秋”劳力，抽调出一些竹匠、木工在队里建立修配站，同供销部的修配门市部、公社农具厂组成了一个修配网；供销部还派人下乡流动修配。短短一个月内，他们就回收改制和修理好了今冬明春生产所需要的畚箕、三角犁、木犁、洋镐、水车等十多种农具，共四千四百多件。农业机械的配件、零件，供销部也尽力帮助公社五金机械厂自行加工制造。现在，已经制造成功海立脱活塞、气缸螺丝等七种特殊规格的配件，为公社五台机型稀有的柴油机备好了足够的配件。
    与此同时，供销部也及时向有关各方面组织进货。营业员同农业机械使用人员一起精打细算，拟订进货计划，使采购的配件品种、规格、数量都切合实际需要。目前，他们已经购进价值八千多元的拖拉机、抽水机、内燃机等农业机械的配件、零件，四万多件竹杠、扁担等物品和一部分修造农具用的竹料、木料、铅丝、元钉等，基本上备齐了公社不能自行解决的生产资料。
    目前，大团公社供销部正一面继续组织货源，一面把一部分竹木农具提前拨到生产队。
