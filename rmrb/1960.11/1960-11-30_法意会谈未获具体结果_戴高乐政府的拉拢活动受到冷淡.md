Xinhua News Agency, Rome, November 27th: The talks between the leaders of the French and Italian governments in Rome ended on the 26th without achieving any concrete results.

    French Prime Minister Debré and Foreign Minister Couve de Murville arrived in Rome on the 25th. According to reports, during the two days of talks with Italian Prime Minister Fanfani and others, their main goal was to win Italian support for De Gaulle's proposal to establish a political secretariat for the six-nation "Common Market," so that France could further utilize the "Common Market" group to contend with the United States and Britain. France also demanded Italian support for France's policy of aggression against Algeria.

    The communique issued after the Franco-Italian talks only vaguely mentioned the "need to strengthen political understanding among members of the European Economic Community (Common Market)." Agence France-Presse reporter Forte commented on this point, noting that the talks "clearly failed to make a decision on what measures to take to strengthen cooperation (among Common Market members)." Forte said that measures in this regard would be left to the summit meeting of the six "Common Market" countries to be held in Paris in early December for discussion.

    Roman newspapers pointed out that France had asked Italy to support France in the United Nations General Assembly debate on the Algerian issue, but Fanfani was unwilling to make any concrete promises. The final communique of the talks did not mention the Algerian issue.

    法意会谈未获具体结果
    戴高乐政府的拉拢活动受到冷淡
    据新华社27日讯　罗马消息：在罗马举行的法国意大利两国政府领导人的会谈在26日结束，没有获得具体结果。
    法国总理德勃雷和外交部长德姆维尔是在25日到达罗马的。据报道，他们在这次同意大利总理范范尼等人的两天会谈中，主要想拉拢意大利支持戴高乐提出的建立六国“共同市场”政治秘书处的计划，以便法国能够进一步利用“共同市场”集团来同美国和英国抗衡。法国还要求意大利支持法国的侵略阿尔及利亚的政策。
    法意会谈结束后发表的公报里只空泛地谈到加强“欧洲经济集团（共同市场）成员国间的政治谅解的需要”。法新社记者福特在评论这一点时指出，会谈“明显地没有就究竟采取什么措施来加强（共同市场成员国的）合作的问题作出决定”。福特说，这方面的措施要留待12月初在巴黎举行的“共同市场”六国首脑会议上去讨论。
    罗马报纸指出，法国要求意大利在联合国大会辩论阿尔及利亚问题时支持法国，但是范范尼也不肯作出具体允诺。双方会谈公报中结果没有提到阿尔及利亚问题。
