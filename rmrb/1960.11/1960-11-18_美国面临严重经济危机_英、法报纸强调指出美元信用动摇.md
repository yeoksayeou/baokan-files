    US Faces Severe Economic Crisis
    British and French Newspapers Emphasize Dollar Credit Shake-Up

    America's Dollar Reserves Have Dropped to a Dangerous Level

    Other countries have, for a long time, been watching with great interest the American response to the declining trend of its gold reserves. For almost all of these countries, the implications of the dollar's future activity are very important. Unless the situation changes quickly, America's reserves will soon fall into the $18 billion mark, which is considered a particularly important threshold in the struggle to maintain the current price of the dollar against gold.

    If the current trend continues, it will fall below this number within a few weeks. Monetary expert Dr. Pick has declared, "A limit of $18 billion must be set, within which the United States can maintain the dollar's position as a world currency without further significant loss of its function."

    It must be admitted that the fact that reserves have reached what is generally considered a dangerous level may itself help explain what the dollar will encounter in the coming period—certainly not a beneficial encounter. Therefore, the next month or two will always be a decisive period for the dollar.　——Summary of an article in the British "Financial Times" on November 8

    US Government Finds it Difficult to Cope with Economic Crisis

    The view of official economists is that a particularly arduous task awaits the new American president, who will have to solve the serious problems posed by the fight against recession, payment deficits, and gold outflows.

    It is first emphasized that using old methods to combat recession—loosening monetary policy, increasing federal spending, or reducing taxes—will certainly result in increased payment deficits.

    It is pointed out that loosening monetary policy due to interest rates may cause capital flight and non-dollar investments. Economists also say that a large deficit in the US budget for just one year, caused by the fight against recession, may also shake the long-term credit of the dollar among foreign financiers.

    On the other hand, serious agricultural problems face the new president. Efforts have been made to reduce surplus agricultural products, but so far, the proposed agricultural plans have not significantly reduced production. This means that the government will have to pay large subsidies for agricultural surpluses in order to maintain farmers' incomes.

    The accelerated outflow of American gold in the past few weeks, especially the outflow of more than 400 million US dollars worth of gold in the recent three weeks, is an urgent problem facing the new government.

    The Three Major Problems Currently Facing the US Government

    Regardless of who is elected today, it will take great mental courage to resist the threat of inflation and maintain world confidence in the dollar. There are three issues that urgently need to be addressed. One is to tighten budget control so that there is a real surplus in prosperous times and to prevent huge deficits in times of recession. Second, the sharp increase in short-term treasury debt has given the American public a huge potential purchasing power, which may become active at the most inconvenient time. Third, the effectiveness of financial policy has been weakened, partly due to the increase in short-term treasury debt and partly due to the increasing speed of money circulation.

    Whatever kind of American government emerges in the coming years, it will not be allowed to ignore these problems, because its handling of these problems will be watched by people outside the United States holding approximately 20 billion US dollars, who will watch America's financial practices as closely as they watch the management of their own banks. If they see standards being further relaxed, they will become increasingly doubtful about whether the money they are now depositing is safe. Maintaining the discipline of a huge international debt will seriously affect the scale of Washington's plans and policies.

### 美国面临严重经济危机  英、法报纸强调指出美元信用动摇

    美国面临严重经济危机
    英、法报纸强调指出美元信用动摇
    美国的美元储备已下降到危险境地
    其他国家在过去长时期以来就以极大的兴趣注意美国对于本国黄金储备下降趋势的反应，对于几乎所有这些国家来说，美元未来活动的含义是非常重要的。除非情况迅速转变，美国的储备不久将跌进一百八十亿美元的大关，这是人们认为在维持美元对黄金的目前价格的斗争中具有特殊重要意义的大关。
    如果目前的趋势继续下去，它将在几个星期之内跌进这个数字。货币专家老皮克博士曾经宣称，“必须规定一百八十亿美元是一种限额，美国在这种限额之内才能维持作为世界货币的美元的地位而不致进一步重大丧失它的作用。”
    必须承认，储备已达到大家认为是危险境地的这一事实，本身就可以有助于说明美元在今后一段时期内会有什么遭遇——自然不是一种有所裨益的遭遇。因此，今后一两个月对于美元来说总会是一段决定性的时期。　——英国“金融时报”11月8日文章摘要
    美国政府难于应付经济危机
    官方经济学家的看法是：一个特别艰苦的任务等待着美国新总统，他将必须解决反对衰退斗争、支付赤字和黄金外流所提出的严重问题。
    人们首先强调指出，使用老办法来反对衰退——放松银根、增加联邦开支或缩减税收——，将肯定地产生增加支付赤字的结果。
    有人指出：由于尽利率而引起的放松银根，可能引起资金逃散，而不以美元进行投资。经济学家还说，为了反对衰退而引起的美国预算仅仅一年的大量赤字，也可能在外国金融界人士中动摇美元的长期信用。
    另一方面，严重的农业问题摆在新总统面前。已经尽力来减少剩余农产品，但是直到目前，所主张的农业计划仍未大大减少生产。这意味着政府将不得不为农产品过剩支付大量的补助金，以便维持农民的收入。
    美国黄金在过去几周内加速外流，特别是最近三周内外流价值四亿多美元的黄金，这是新政府面临的一个紧急问题。
                         ——法国“新闻报”11月10日评论摘要
    美国政府当前的三大难题
    不管今天谁当选，都需要有极大的精神上的勇气来挡住通货膨胀的威胁，保持世界对美元的信任。有三个问题亟需加以解决。一个是，加紧控制预算，使其在兴旺时期有真正的盈余，防止在衰退时期出现巨额亏空。第二，国库短期债务大大增加，使得美国公众拥有巨大的潜在的购买力，而这种购买力可能在最不便当的时候变得活跃起来。第三，金融政策的效能已被削弱，这部分是由于国库短期债务增加、部分是由于钱款流转速度日益加快造成的。
    今后数年不论出现什么样的美国政府，都不允许忽视这些问题，因为它对这些问题的处理将受到美国以外持有约二百亿美元的人们的注视，他们要像注视他们自己的银行管理情况那样地注视美国在财政上的作法，如果他们看到标准进一步放松的话，他们就会越来越怀疑，他们现在存放的钱是否保险。保持一宗巨额国际债款的纪律将严重地对华盛顿的计划和政策的规模起作用。
