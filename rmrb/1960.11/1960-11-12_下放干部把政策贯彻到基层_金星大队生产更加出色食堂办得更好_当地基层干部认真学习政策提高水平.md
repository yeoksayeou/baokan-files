Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, November 11th. Cadres sent down from the CCP Gannan District Committee and the CCP Ruijin County Committee to the Jinxing Brigade of the Shazhouba Commune in Ruijin County actively helped local grassroots cadres earnestly study policies, and extensively and deeply publicized the policies to commune members and inspected the implementation of policies, so that the Party's various policies were further implemented, and all tasks were done even more outstandingly than in the past.

The three cadres sent down to this brigade by the Gannan District Party Committee and the Ruijin County Committee, Yu Haiqing, Wang Chenquan, and Zheng Kebiao, were stationed in three small teams respectively. In eating, living, and working with the commune members, they found that the commune members were very concerned about the Party's various policies and raised many policy questions related to their own vital interests, asking the cadres to answer them. After understanding this, the dispatched cadres, under the leadership of the brigade Party branch, first organized the brigade and small team cadres to study the Party's policies, giving lectures to study documents, and combining this with summing up and inspecting work, so that the grassroots cadres realized that the Party's policies represented the interests of the masses, and seriously and conscientiously implementing the Party's policies was the key to doing all tasks well. In the past two months, they have organized twenty-five study sessions among the masses. The dispatched cadres and local cadres have also used various opportunities to specifically explain the Party's various policies to the masses, and in conjunction with current work, further implemented the various policies. The masses were concerned about the issue of eating vegetables in the canteen, so while expanding the canteen's collective vegetable planting, they mobilized the commune members to plant vegetables in their private plots and strictly implemented the policy of self-planting and self-harvesting. As a result, the seventeen canteens of the whole team generally established relatively solid foundations, with an average of 0.17 mu of vegetables planted per person, and also raised 150 pigs and 7,700 chickens and ducks. The canteen was more than self-sufficient in vegetables and could also supply the market.

After extensively publicizing to the masses and further implementing the Party's various policies, a new atmosphere has emerged in the production of this production team. According to the Party's policy of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," the production team comprehensively and rationally arranged the labor force, organizing eighty-five people to find sideline opportunities in the gaps of agricultural production to increase the income of commune members. On this basis, a system of paying wages on a monthly basis was established. In the autumn harvest and winter planting, the "three guarantees and one reward" system was further implemented, the "three guarantees" targets were adjusted, and reasonable labor quota schemes were formulated. Of the seventeen contracted units in the entire brigade, except for three contracted units that could not exceed production due to drought, the remaining fourteen small teams exceeded production and received rewards. The enthusiasm of the commune members for production was greatly developed. More than 60% of the commune members exceeded the labor quotas, and 129 people were rated as "five-good" commune members. The autumn harvest and autumn planting generally achieved fast harvesting, clean threshing, more planting, and better planting. All the idle autumn fields in the entire brigade have been planted with wheat and winter beans this year.

    下放干部把政策贯彻到基层
    金星大队生产更加出色食堂办得更好
    当地基层干部认真学习政策提高水平
    新华社南昌11日电　中共赣南区委和中共瑞金县委下放在瑞金县沙洲坝公社金星大队的干部，积极帮助当地基层干部认真学习政策，并且广泛深入地向社员宣传政策和检查政策执行情况，使党的各项方针政策进一步得到贯彻，各项工作也做得比过去更加出色。
    赣南区党委和瑞金县委下放到这个大队的有余海清、王臣泉、郑克标三个干部，分别驻在三个小队。他们在与社员同吃、同住、同劳动中，发现社员对党的各项政策非常关心，提出了许多有关自己切身利益的政策问题，请干部解答。下放干部了解后，就在大队党支部的领导下，首先组织大队、小队干部学习党的政策，一面讲课学文件，一面结合总结和检查工作，使基层干部认识到，党的方针、政策代表了群众的利益，严肃认真地贯彻执行党的政策，是做好各项工作的关键。最近两个多月来，他们在群众中组织了二十五次学习，下放干部和当地干部还利用各种机会向群众具体讲解党的各项政策，并结合当前工作，把各项政策进一步贯彻下去。群众关心食堂吃菜的问题，他们便在扩大食堂集体种菜的同时，发动社员在自留地里大种蔬菜，并严格执行自种自收的政策。结果，全队十七个食堂普遍建立了比较雄厚的家底，每人平均种了一分七厘田蔬菜，还养了一百五十头猪，七千七百多只鸡鸭。食堂的蔬菜自给有余，还能供应市场。
    向群众广泛宣传并进一步贯彻执行党的各项方针政策后，这个生产队在生产上也出现了新的气象。生产队根据党的“以粮为纲、全面跃进”的方针，全面合理地安排劳动力，组织八十五人在农业生产的空隙寻找副业门路，增加社员收入。在此基础上，建立了按月发放工资的制度。在秋收冬种中进一步贯彻了三包一奖制度，调整了“三包”指标，合理制定了劳动定额方案。全大队十七个包产单位，除三个包产单位因受旱不能超产外，其余十四个小队都超产得奖。社员的生产积极性大大发扬，有60％以上的社员突破劳动定额，一百二十九人评上了“五好”社员，秋收秋种普遍做到了收得快、打得净、种得多、种得好。全大队的全部秋闲田今年都种上了小麦、冬豆。
