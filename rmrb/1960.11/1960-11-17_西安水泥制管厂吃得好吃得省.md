    (Our dispatch) The Xi'an Cement Pipe Factory's employee cafeteria has meticulous management and careful planning. The meals are varied, ensuring that employees eat their fill, eat well, eat economically, and are convenient and satisfied.
    The factory, through "politics entering the cafeteria and the Party secretary going to the kitchen," conducted detailed ideological education work for employees and cooks, making everyone aware of the importance of planned grain use and saving grain. At the same time, they improved cooking techniques. In addition to rice and steamed buns, the staple food includes steamed cake, vegetable buns, vegetable rolls, and various noodles.

    Planned grain use is the key to running a good cafeteria. The factory's employee cafeteria has strengthened planned management in all aspects and earnestly achieves planned grain use and grain saving. In addition to establishing a food committee and relying on the masses to run the cafeteria well, they have also established grain storekeepers, inspectors, and planned allocation officers among the cooks, so that the cooks also participate in management work. Grain and grain coupons are managed by designated personnel, recorded in special accounts, and regularly announced to the masses to ensure that grain is used strictly in accordance with the plan. The cafeteria has internal regulations requiring the administrator to inform the cooks of the number of people eating, the monthly grain supply, and the grain quota for each meal each day, so that every cook has a clear understanding, everyone participates in accounting, implements measuring rice before cooking, and accounts after meals, achieving "do not eat noon grain for breakfast, and do not eat noon rice for dinner."
    This year, in accordance with the spirit of "self-reliance and ample food and clothing," they used their spare time to grow vegetables on more than 90 mu of scattered land, and have now harvested more than 50,000 jin of various vegetables. Vegetable self-sufficiency has increased from 40% to 80%.
    In the first three quarters of this year, the factory was rated as a red flag unit in the city, the city's building materials industry bureau system, and Weiyang District, respectively. The employees and the masses composed a quick-paced ballad to praise their cafeteria, saying:
      Our factory cafeteria is extraordinary,
      Saving grain is done well,
      We eat our fill and eat deliciously,
      We have enough energy for good production.

    西安水泥制管厂吃得好吃得省
    本报讯　西安水泥制管厂职工食堂管理细致，计划周到，饭菜花样多，保证了职工吃饱、吃好、吃省和方便、满意。
    这个厂通过“政治进食堂，书记下伙房”，对职工和炊事人员进行了细致的思想教育工作，使人人了解计划用粮和节约用粮的重要意义，同时，改进了做饭技术，主食除米饭、馍以外，还有虚糕、菜馍、菜卷和各种面条；副食每天保持有几个花样。不仅保证职工吃得满意，9、10月份还节余了二千六百多斤粮食。
    计划用粮，是办好食堂的关键。这个厂的职工食堂从各方面加强了计划管理，认真做到计划用粮和节约用粮。他们除健全了伙食委员会，依靠群众办好食堂外，还在炊事员中设立了粮库员、验收员、计划调剂员等，使炊事员也参加管理工作。粮食和粮票都设专人管理，专账记载，定期向群众公布，保证粮食严格按照计划使用。食堂内部规定了管理员向炊事人员交代上伙人数、交代每月粮食供应量和每天每顿饭的用粮定额的制度，使炊事员人人心中有数，个个参加核算，实行称米下锅，饭后算账，做到“早餐不吃中午粮，晚饭不吃午间米”。
    今年，他们根据“自己动手，丰衣足食”的精神，利用业余时间，在零星土地上种菜九十多亩，现在已收各种蔬菜五万多斤。蔬菜自给由40％达到80％。
    今年前三个季度，这个厂分别被评为全市、市建筑材料工业局系统和未央区的红旗单位。职工群众编了快板称赞他们的食堂说：
      我厂食堂非等闲，节约粮食搞得好，
      吃得饱来吃得香，干劲足来生产好。
