    Red Family Lovers
    The Changchun Passenger Car Factory enthusiastically launched the "Red Housekeeper Movement," centered on putting politics in command, running the factory diligently and thriftily, and deeply developing technical innovation and technical revolution. This greatly stimulated the workers' sense of ownership in taking the factory as their home, running the factory diligently and thriftily, taking waste as a shame, and taking frugality as an honor. A vivid situation emerged in the factory where one red flag was erected and thousands of red flags fluttered, and the production appearance was completely renewed. From the third quarter to the present, more than 450 workers have won the glorious title of "Red Housekeeper"; there have appeared more than 11 multi-treasure work sections, 66 multi-treasure groups, and more than 310 multi-treasure equipment; more than 560 sets of multi-treasure technology have been compiled, and the production technology of more than 600 kinds of parts has been refreshed. The efficiency of machining has increased by 50% compared with the second quarter, labor productivity has increased by 23.9%, the cost of passenger cars has decreased by 14.96%, and each car can save two tons of steel.
    ?　The workers skillfully used raw materials, greatly improving the utilization rate of raw materials, and making many waste materials reused in production. Now the utilization rate of steel in the whole factory has increased to more than 95%. In the past two months, more than 140 tons of steel have been saved, more than 120 cubic meters of old wood have been saved and utilized, and more than 150 tons of coal have been saved. This is the shearing group of the stamping workshop studying how to cleverly cut steel plates.
    ?　Zou Shuqin (left) and other seven apprentices in the foundry workshop picked up 109 tons of scrap iron during their rest time, solving the material problem for the castings of more than 30 passenger cars. They were gloriously named the factory's "Red Detachment of Women," and Zou Shuqin was praised as a "Red Housekeeper."
    ?　Apprentice pacesetter Wang Wenqin, a car electrician in the final assembly workshop, used broken felt pieces to assemble a passenger car, setting an example for the whole factory to carry out savings. Recently, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. This is him installing an oscillating fan.
    ?　In the "Red Housekeeper" movement, the workers centralized all kinds of tools in the workshop and had them managed by one worker, which not only avoided backlog and waste, but also improved work efficiency.

    红色爱家人
    长春客车厂热烈开展了以政治挂帅、勤俭办厂、深入开展技术革新和技术革命为中心内容的“红色管家人运动”。大大激发了职工们以厂为家、勤俭办厂，以浪费为耻，以节约为荣的主人翁思想，全厂出现了一面红旗树起、千面红旗飘扬的生动局面，生产面貌焕然一新。从第三季度开始到目前为止，已有四百五十多名职工获得了“红色管家人”的光荣称号；出现了十一个多宝工段、六十六个多宝小组、三百一十多台多宝设备；编出了五百六十多套多宝工艺，刷新了六百多种零件的生产工艺。机械加工效率比第二季度提高了50％，劳动生产率提高了23.9％，客车成本降低了14.96％，每节车还能节省两吨钢材。
    ?　职工们巧用原材料，大大提高了原材料的利用率，并使许多废旧物资重新用于生产。现在全厂钢材利用率已提高到95％以上，两个月来共节约钢材一百四十余吨，节约和利用旧木材一百二十余立方米，节约煤炭一百五十余吨。这是冲压车间剪切小组在研究巧裁钢板。
    ?　铸工车间邹淑琴（左）等七名徒工，利用休息时间拣了一百零九吨废铁，解决了三十多辆客车铸件的材料，光荣地被命名为这个厂的“红色支队”，邹淑琴被誉为“红色管家人”。
    ?　徒工标兵、总装车间车电工王文琴，用碎毛毡块对在一起，装了一辆客车，为全厂开展节约树立了榜样。最近，光荣地参加了中国共产党。这是他在安装摇头风扇。
    ?　在“红色管家人”运动中，工人们把车间的各种刀具都集中起来，由一名工人兼管，不仅避免了积压和浪费现象，而且提高了工作效率。
