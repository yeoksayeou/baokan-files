Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, November 7th: The issue of recognizing the People's Republic of China has recently become a focus of attention in the Lebanese parliament and public opinion. This is due to the fact that the delegation led by Lebanese Prime Minister Salam voted against discussing the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations General Assembly. This action immediately aroused opposition from many political figures and public opinion in Lebanon, all of whom demanded recognition of China. The Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee also strongly demanded that Salam attend its meeting to answer questions on this issue. At the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on the 3rd, Salam refused to answer questions on this issue. The Foreign Affairs Committee said that if Salam insisted on not accepting their request, they would resign en masse. Salam later agreed on the 4th to issue a statement on this issue at a Foreign Affairs Committee meeting, which is scheduled to be held on the 8th.

Lebanese Speaker of Parliament Sabri Hamad recently issued a statement saying, "I have already requested recognition of China in Parliament, and I still maintain my opinion." He said, "I am surprised how we can ignore a country with 650 million people." Hamad pointed out that the Lebanese delegation to the United Nations "should not have voted in favor" of rejecting the proposal to discuss China's representation.

According to the Lebanese News Agency, former Deputy Speaker Fadel, and parliamentarians Akim, Saad, and Qadri, have all told the press that they support the proposal for Lebanon to recognize the People's Republic of China. Sidon District Parliamentarian Saad said that on the issue of China's representation, the Lebanese delegation to the United Nations "should be consistent with the fraternal Arab countries, because it is unreasonable for us to take a hostile attitude towards a country like China with 650 million people."

The Lebanese Progressive Socialist Party recently issued a statement demanding that the government recognize China and establish diplomatic relations between the two countries. The statement said that on this issue, a consistent attitude should be adopted with other liberated Arab and Asian-African countries.

Lebanese newspapers have also recently published numerous commentaries calling for recognition of China, pointing out that opposing discussion of the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations is incompatible with a neutral policy. "Al-Haya" said in an editorial: "People's China is a socialist country that exposes the schemes of colonialists and struggles for peace. Therefore, the United States, proceeding from its imperialist interests, advocates that such a large country should not be allowed to enter the United Nations, lest another strong voice tearing apart the masks of colonialists resound within this organization." It said, "The United States is trying to use its various tools and agents to cover the eyes of people all over the world, so that they cannot see the existence of 650 million people represented by a large country like the sun, which Eisenhower's fingers cannot cover." The newspaper said, "Let Lebanon recognize this country from now on, recognize this reality. It is shameful that our policy in this regard should even be the tail of American policy."

"Beirut Evening News" said that the demand for recognition of China is "reasonable and just."

    黎巴嫩公众要求政府承认我国
    哈马德议长指责出席联大的黎代表团阻挠讨论中国代表权问题
    “呼声报”说黎巴嫩在承认中国问题上作美国政策尾巴是可耻的
    新华社7日讯　贝鲁特消息：要求承认中华人民共和国问题最近成为黎巴嫩议会和舆论界的一个注意中心。这是由于黎巴嫩总理萨拉姆率领的代表团在联合国大会会议上投票反对讨论恢复中国在联合国的合法席位问题所引起的。这个行动立即激起黎巴嫩许多政界人士和舆论的反对，他们都要求承认中国。议会外交委员会并且坚决要求萨拉姆出席它的会议对这个问题答复质询。在议会外交委员会3日的会议上，萨拉姆曾拒绝就这个问题答复质询。外交委员会说，如果萨拉姆坚持不接受他们的要求，他们将全体辞职。萨拉姆后来在4日同意在外交委员会会议上就这个问题发表声明，这个会议预定8日举行。
    黎巴嫩议长萨布里·哈马德最近发表声明说，“我已经在议会里要求承认中国，我仍然坚持我的意见。”他说，“我奇怪，我们怎么能够忽视一个拥有六亿五千万人口的国家。”哈马德指出，黎巴嫩出席联大的代表团对于拒绝讨论中国代表权的建议，“不该投赞成票”。
    据黎巴嫩通讯社报道，前副议长法德尔、议员阿基姆、萨德和卡德里等，都向报界表示，支持黎巴嫩承认中华人民共和国的主张。西顿区议员萨德说，在中国代表权问题上，黎巴嫩代表团在联合国中“应当同阿拉伯姐妹国家一致，因为我们对于像中国这样一个拥有六亿五千万人口的国家采取敌对态度是不合理的。”
    黎巴嫩社会进步党最近发表声明，要求政府承认中国并建立两国的外交关系。声明说，在这个问题上，应当同其他获得自由的阿拉伯和亚非国家采取一致的态度。
    黎巴嫩报纸最近也纷纷发表评论，要求承认中国，指出反对讨论恢复中国在联合国的合法席位问题是同中立政策不相容的。“呼声报”在社论中说：“人民中国是一个社会主义国家，它揭露殖民主义者的策划，为争取和平而斗争。因此，美国从它的帝国主义利益出发就主张不能让这样一个大国进入联合国，以免这个组织之内再响起另一个撕破殖民主义者假面具的强音。”它说，“美国企图利用它的各种工具和代理人来遮住全世界人民的眼睛，使他们看不到艾森豪威尔的指头遮不住的像太阳一样的一个大国所代表的六亿五千万人口的存在。”报纸说，“让黎巴嫩从现在起就承认这个国家，承认这个现实吧。我们的政策在这方面甚至也要作美国政策的尾巴，这是可耻的。”
    “贝鲁特晚报”说，要求承认中国的主张是“合理的和正义的”。
