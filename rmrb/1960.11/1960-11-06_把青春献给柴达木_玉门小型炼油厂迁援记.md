	Dedicating Youth to Qaidam
	——A Record of the Yumen Small Refinery's Relocation and Support
	Liu Yu, Tian Zuwei
	Yuan Shengping, the section chief of the refining section, walked out of the factory director's office and looked at the refinery, with its forest of oil derricks, and the vibrant petroleum city on the Gobi Desert, for the first time with a gaze of fascination. This old refining worker, who had lived in the Yumen Oil Mine for eighteen years, suddenly felt a complex mix of emotions.

	The factory director had just informed him: to support the development of crude oil refining in Qaidam, the small refinery and its entire team would be transferred to Qaidam under his leadership. This small refinery was the pride and joy of the Yumen refining workers; it was built by the refining workers during the Great Leap Forward in 1958, using their daring spirit and available scrap materials, in a hard-fought twenty-seven days. Now, the oil mine organization had decided to contribute it entirely to Qaidam. The factory director's words echoed in his ears: "Wherever there is oil, there are Yumen people! Using the best materials and the best equipment to support where it is needed, that is the Yumen style. You must successfully complete this glorious mission."

	With an excited heart, Yuan Shengping walked into the duty room of the small refinery. The young men, who had somehow already heard the news, immediately gathered around him, asking all at once, "Section Chief, when are we leaving?" Old Yuan looked at the excited faces with joy and said with a smile, "As soon as the order comes, we'll dismantle the factory; as soon as the equipment is transported, we'll set off."

	Early in the morning, while the petroleum city was still ablaze with lights, the team led by Yuan Shengping was already busy at the small refinery. The entire refinery staff was supporting the dismantling and relocation project, just like when the factory was built, the construction site was buzzing with voices and the clanging of tools day and night. The tall oil derricks were already lying on the ground, rows of furnace tubes were neatly bundled together like bamboo rafts about to go into the water, and the cooling coils in the water pools had also been removed.

	After fifteen days of work, all the factory equipment was dismantled, filling a full twenty-four large trucks. As the long motorcade drove away, the future Qaidam refining workers could not contain their joy, their hearts already flying with the motorcade towards the Qaidam Basin.

	In the evening, the factory Party committee secretary and the factory director invited everyone to a tea party in the Party committee meeting room. The Party committee secretary said: "The place you are going is the glorious front line of our country's petroleum industry. I hope you will maintain the glorious traditions of Yumen, overcome all difficulties, and create great achievements in Qaidam. We will be listening for your good news!"

	Yuan Shengping, on behalf of everyone, replied firmly: "We will never let down the Party's teachings and cultivation, nor will we let down the expectations of all the comrades in the mine. We guarantee to the Party: we will dedicate all our energy and our entire youth to the rich Qaidam Basin of our motherland!"

	The westward expedition crossed the verdant Wuhua Mountains, crossed the blue Shule River, passed the threshold of Qinghai, and headed straight for the destination of the small refinery's relocation and support.

	Qaidam treated the twenty-five Yumen people like distinguished guests. A middle-aged, burly man, like a receptionist, constantly brought them tea and water, asking about their well-being. He told them to rest for a few days; this was actually Lei Zhengjiang, the director of the Qaidam Refinery.

	The young men surrounded him and said, "No, Director Lei. We are not tired at all, let us go to the factory tomorrow!"

	"Go to the factory?" The director laughed. "Where is the factory? The equipment has not been installed yet!"

	"Then let us at least see the place!"

	The young men insisted on starting work immediately. The director had no choice but to take them to the construction area the next day. There were only two tents rustling in the wind and sand, and a construction team from the Northeast was only just laying the foundation for the oil derrick.

	The entire team immediately set to work building their own "home." Several new canvas tents were erected on the Gobi Desert, and the young men sat on the swaying canvas cots, laughing and joking: "Ha, this is softer than a wire bed!" The night of the basin arrived. It was as if thousands of troops and horses were galloping on the Gobi Desert, and sand and stones hit the tents, making a rustling sound. However, everyone felt happy in their hearts, a new life had begun!

	The next day at dawn, they came to the construction site, raised their picks and worked alongside the construction team. Large chunks of salt on the ground caused a lot of trouble for the construction, this salt was as hard as thick ice in the dead of winter, and the pickaxe hit it, causing the fingers to go numb. However, these young men from Yumen and those young men from the Northeast secretly started a competition. Everyone worked like a fierce tiger, from seven in the morning until eleven at night, rain or shine, day after day. Two distillation towers stood like green pines in the wind and sand of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

	Suddenly, Xu Xinghai, the old refinery worker in charge of engineering acceptance, hurriedly came to find Yuan Shengping. He discovered that there was no high-voltage lightning protection equipment on the towers and furnaces, and there were no wind tunnels or fire holes on the furnaces. It turned out that the terrain here was different from Yumen, and the equipment layout was different, so there were missing parts and pipelines. Where could they find this equipment in this vast Gobi Desert? Director Lei Zhengjiang also became anxious.

	Yuan Shengping remembered the process of building the small refinery in Yumen and got excited, and quickly asked Lei Zhengjiang: "Are there any old scrap materials here?"

	"Scrap materials? There has never been a refinery here before, where would scrap materials come from?" The director pondered with difficulty. Suddenly, he asked: "Can the old scrap materials from the drilling be used?" Yuan Shengping and Xu Xinghai were not familiar with the equipment used in drilling, but they thought: as long as there is something, we can always find a way to substitute it!

	So, they took a group of people and ran around the drilling site picking up scraps, lifting heavy steel pipes, switches, and other waste materials, and laboriously crossing the desert to modify them. The factory construction work continued at a high speed. During the two months of factory construction, they worked hard day and night, sometimes not even getting a drink of water, but still battling the raging wind and sand and the scorching sun. The people of Qinghai-Tibet's expectation for the refining industry, and the lofty sense of honor of winning glory for the people of Yumen, encouraged them to overcome all difficulties.

	On the eve of the completion of the refinery's construction, the Yumen Oil Mine once again sent a test plant group with great care. Leading this five-person team was Gong Dehai, deputy section chief of the motor section and engineer of the Yumen Refinery. Later, in formal production, clear and bright gasoline, kerosene, and golden diesel fuel filled the tank cars, speeding past Gas Lake, speeding past the Altun Mountains, and speeding across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

    把青春献给柴达木
    ——玉门小型炼油厂迁援记
    刘玉  田祖玮
    炼油工段工段长袁生平，从厂长办公室走出来，第一次用迷恋的眼光望着油塔成林的炼油厂，望着这生气勃勃的戈壁滩上的石油城。这个在玉门油矿生活了十八年的老炼油工，心里顿时泛起一阵复杂的感情。
    厂长刚才通知他：为支援柴达木开创炼制原油的事业，要把小型炼油厂和全套人马，由他率领，全部调往柴达木。这个小型炼厂，是玉门炼油工人的宠儿；是在1958年大跃进中，炼油工人们以敢想敢干的英雄气概，利用旧废料，苦战二十七天建成的。现在，油矿组织上决定要将它全盘贡献给柴达木。厂长的话，在他耳畔响着：“哪里有石油，哪里就有玉门人！拿最好的材料，最好的设备，支援必需的地方，这是玉门的风格。你们要很好地完成这个光荣任务。”
    袁生平怀着激动的心情，走进小炼油厂值班室。不知从那里已听到消息的小伙子们，一下子就围拢上来，七嘴八舌地问：“段长，什么时候走呵？”老袁欣喜地看着一张张兴奋的脸，笑着说：“命令一来，咱们就拆厂子；设备一运走，咱们就动身。”
    清晨，石油城还是一片辉煌的灯火，袁生平领的一班人马已经在小炼油厂忙起来了。整个炼油厂职工都在支援拆迁工程，像以前建厂时一样，工地上日夜不息地沸腾着人声和工具的叮当声。高高的油塔已躺在地上，一排排的炉管像将要下水的竹筏一样，整齐地绑扎着，水池里的冷却管盘也已卸下来了。
    经过十五天的工作，全部工厂设备才拆卸完毕，整整装满了二十四部大卡车。当长长的汽车队开走的时候，未来的柴达木炼油工人们按不住心头的喜悦，他们的心已随着车队飞向了柴达木盆地。
    晚上，厂党委书记和厂长把大家请到党委会议室开茶话会。党委书记说：“你们前去的地方是我国石油工业的光荣前线，希望你们保持在玉门的光荣传统，战胜一切困难，在柴达木创建丰功伟绩。我们听着你们的好消息！”
    袁生平代表大伙，坚定地回答：“我们绝不辜负党的教导和培养，也绝不辜负全矿同志对我们的期望。我们向党保证：把全副精力和整个青春献给祖国富饶的柴达木盆地！”
    西征的行列越过青翠的五华山，跨过蓝色的疏勒河，过青海的门槛，直向小炼油厂迁援的目的地奔去。
    柴达木像对待贵宾般接待了二十五个玉门人。有一个中年魁梧健壮的人，像招待员一样不断给他们端茶送水，问寒问暖。他让他们休息几天，原来这就是柴达木炼油厂的厂长雷正江。
    小伙子们围着他说：“不行，雷厂长。我们一点也不累，明天就让我们到厂里去吧！”
    “厂里去？”厂长笑起来。“厂在哪里？设备还没安装起来哩！”
    “那叫我们看看地方也好！”
    小伙子们嚷着非马上工作不可。厂长没有办法，第二天，只得领他们来到建厂区。这里只有两顶在风沙中作响的帐篷，从东北来的一支装建队才在打油塔的地基。
    全体人员立即动手建立自己的“家”。几座新帆布帐篷在戈壁上竖立起来，小伙子们坐在晃动的帆布行军床上，嘻嘻哈哈地打闹：“哈，这比钢丝床还软和！”盆地的夜来了。戈壁上像有千军万马在奔驰，沙石打在帐篷上，发出刷刷的响声。但是，每个人心里却喜孜孜的，新的生活开始了啊！
    次日黎明，他们来到工地，举起镐头和装建队一同干起来。地上大块大块的盐给施工带来不少麻烦，这些盐硬得像十冬腊月的厚冰，镐头刨下去，震得手指发麻。可是，这些玉门来的小伙子和那些东北来的小伙子，暗暗地开展了竞赛。个个干活像猛虎，从早上七点一直干到晚上十一点，不论刮风下雨，天天如此。两座蒸馏塔在青藏高原的风沙中，像青松般地屹立起来。
    忽然，担任工程验收员的老炼油工徐兴海，急急忙忙来找袁生平。他发现塔和炉上没有高压防空设备，炉上也没有风洞和火洞。原来，这里的地形和玉门不一样，设备平面布置不同，因此，缺少了配件和管线。在这茫茫的戈壁滩上，哪里去找这些设备？厂长雷正江也着急起来了。
    袁生平想起在玉门建造小炼厂的过程，就来了劲头，连忙问雷正江：“这里有没有旧废料？”
    “废料？这里从来没有过炼油厂，哪来的废料？”厂长为难地思索着。忽然，他问：钻井上的旧废料能用吗？袁生平和徐兴海都不熟悉钻井上的设备，可是，他们想：只要有东西，总能想法代用上去！
    于是，他们带上一批人，到钻井场上东奔西跑取破烂，把笨重的钢管、开关等废料抬起来，吃力地越过沙漠去改制。建厂工作仍然高速度地进行着。在建厂期间的两个月，他们日夜苦干，有时候喝不上水，可是，仍顶着狂暴的风沙和烈日继续奋战。青藏人民对炼油工业的期望，为玉门人争光的崇高荣誉感，鼓舞他们战胜了一切困难。
    炼油厂建厂竣工前夕，玉门油矿又关怀备至地派来试厂小组。率领这个五人小组的是玉门炼油厂机动科副科长、工程师龚德海。以后，正式生产了，清得透亮的汽油、煤油和金黄色的柴油，装满辆辆的油罐车飞驰过尕斯湖，飞驰过阿尔金山，飞驰在青藏高原上。
