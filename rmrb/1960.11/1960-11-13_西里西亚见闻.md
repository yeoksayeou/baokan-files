Observations in Silesia
Ding Jicang

In the coolness after the rain and the fragrance of plants and trees, we arrived in Katowice, the coal mining and industrial center of Poland. Katowice Province is the heart of Silesian industry. Centered on Katowice, it includes more than a dozen cities such as Sosnowiec, Chorzów, Bytom, and Gliwice. It is the smallest and most densely populated province in Poland. However, this area, which accounts for only one-thirty-third of the country's area, accounts for almost one-third of the country's industrial production.

The coal reserves here are extremely rich, accounting for almost 80% of the country's currently discovered coal reserves. If 100 million tons are mined annually, it will take 700 years to exhaust them. The largest of these, the Dąbrowa coalfield, is known as the Donbas of Poland. Under the rule of the Hitler fascists, the annual output was 20 to 30 million tons, most of which was transported to western Germany. After liberation, under the direct leadership of the Central Coal Industry Department in Katowice, seven mines have been expanded and newly built, 90% of coal mining is mechanized, and conveyor belts are used for transportation. The annual output has reached 60 million tons.

After liberation, the degree of mechanization of coal mining has gradually increased, and there is now a new industry here that manufactures a series of machines for mining and transporting coal. There are not only coal industry schools here, but also modern coal industry research institutes. This research institute has achieved remarkable achievements in underground mining, the use of new technologies, especially the use of hydraulic mining, and new methods of coking. The achievements of the Katowice Province mining area have strengthened Poland's coal industry, and it has won the national highest award, the "Building People's Poland" medal.

On the second day of our arrival in Katowice, we visited the Czeladz Mine. Accompanied by veteran workers, we went down to the 800-meter-deep Michałczuk face. The Taetwus production team, which had won the national first prize in the labor competition two years ago and the second prize in the entire mining area in the second quarter of this year, was mining coal. When we arrived, the young miners surrounded us and answered our questions. The production team leader told us that a general production team produces 16 tons of coal per working day, but by using new technologies and giving full play to the enthusiasm of the youth, they can mine 21 tons of coal per working day. In the roadway, the goaf after mining was filled with sand. The old foreman pointed to the giant iron pipe and said: This is used to blow sand. Mining coal under the city, uses sand filling to prevent collapse. Coal miners understand the meaning of using every minute to produce more tons of coal. Now, a competition to produce more coal is being launched throughout the mining area. Strokowski, the initiator of Poland's famous socialist labor competition, is a worker in this mining area.

We stepped out of the mine and got into the car. Driving on the road in the mining area, we saw newly built houses standing among clusters of lush trees. Roads and reservoirs along the road cut through them. The cool breeze and fresh air made us forget that we were in the mining area. The host told us that the appearance here has greatly changed compared with before liberation. A large cultural park and a stadium with a capacity of 100,000 people have been built between Katowice and Chorzów. Twenty kilometers north of the city, in the embrace of the forest, a new city of Nowa Huta that can accommodate 130,000 steel and coal mining worker families has been built. More than 50,000 households have moved into new homes. Forty kilometers southwest of the city, near the mountains, a large reservoir with a capacity of 5 million cubic meters has been built, which can store a large amount of mountain water, supply water to the mining area and the city, and regulate the climate of the mining area. A new type of coal capital, a socialist industrial city, stands proudly on the land once ravaged by the Hitler fascists, and its speed can be compared with the "Warsaw speed."

We took a train through Opole Province to Upper Silesia, also the second city of Silesia, Wrocław. The day after arriving in this city, it was Sunday, we came to the Sudeten Mountains near the Czechoslovak border, which is a famous tourist and summer resort. Facing the refreshing morning breeze and through the lush forest, what was displayed in front of us were clear green mountains and emerald green rivers. At this time and place, with beautiful scenery, we enjoyed the scenery of the southern mountains and rivers of Silesia. The car sped along the highway, and clusters of forests and rows of high-voltage lines flashed outside the car window. Every 20 to 30 kilometers, a town centered on a factory appeared. Opening the map of Poland, you can see at a glance the upper and lower Silesia regions in the southwest corner. Railways and roads are as dense as spider webs, and dozens of towns, large and small, are dotted along the transportation lines. This is the base of hardware, machinery, chemical, and paper industries. Most of this base was newly built after liberation, and some was rebuilt after the war.

The next day, we visited the largest factory in Wrocław, the National Car Manufacturing Plant. When the Hitler fascist army retreated, all the machines in this factory were moved away and destroyed. Over the past fifteen years, after expansion and new construction, the equipment has been renewed, and 100,000 carriages have been manufactured for domestic and foreign countries. Now, an average of 24 carriages are produced every day, and the production of new electric locomotives has begun. The manager of the factory told us that the biggest feature of the factory's development in recent years is to greatly tap labor potential, reduce costs, and increase output without increasing workers. Last winter, the factory organized an investigation to study the work efficiency of each worker, and found that workers only used 64% of the eight-hour working time. This year, workers were mobilized to put forward more than 1,000 proposals, revised technical quotas, and improved labor organization. The utilization rate of working time has increased to 75%. In addition to other measures, the production efficiency in the first half of this year has increased by 40% compared with the same period last year. This made the workers realize the benefits of using every minute of time. Now the factory is conducting an investigation to further study how workers use working time and how to improve labor organization. They believe that they can further tap labor potential. This powerful potential comes from the leadership of the Party. This factory is an example of implementing the instructions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, and it has pointed out a way to tap potential for Poland's machinery manufacturing industry, and even all industries.

The Polish people are using their hardworking hands to build Silesia even better. In October 1957, the Polish Party and government decided to build a magnificent mining and power joint center in the Turów area on the Nysa River in the southwest corner of Silesia. Now, more than 60,000 workers are engaged in construction and production here. An open-pit coal mine with an annual output of 6 million tons is still being expanded, and a huge power station with a power generation capacity of 1.2 million kilowatts has also begun construction. A new type of socialist industrial city will stand on the border of Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia, providing more fuel and power for the socialist construction of the three countries.

While building Silesia, the Polish working class is also constantly vigilant and defending their homeland. I remember when we were guests at the home of a steel worker's family in Katowice, the host recounted the experience of being enslaved by the Hitler fascists. When talking about the beautiful life in front of us, this simple and strong worker couldn't help but raise his muscular arms and said: "In order to build a better life, we must produce more high-quality steel. When imperialism dares to invade, we will use steel weapons to smash its head severely." He pointed to his three sons beside the table and told us: "The eldest son's ambition is to become an engineer, the middle one wants to be a navy, and the youngest doesn't have any specific ideas yet." The memory of the past hard life and the yearning for the beautiful life in front of us deeply inspire the Polish working class's determination to build and defend socialism. (Attached picture)

    西里西亚见闻
    丁济沧
    在雨后的凉爽和草木的清香中，我们来到了波兰煤矿和工业中心卡托维茨城。卡托维茨省是西里西亚工业的心脏。以卡托维茨市为中心，包括索斯诺维赤、霍苏夫、贝土姆、格维赤等十几个城市。这是波兰面积最小、人口最密的省份。但是在这只占全国面积三十三分之一的地区内，工业生产却几乎占全国的三分之一。
    这里煤藏极为丰富，几占全国现已发现的储煤量的80％。如以每年挖一亿吨计算，七百年还挖不完。其中最大的董勃罗夫煤区，被称为波兰的顿巴斯。希特勒法西斯统治时，这里年产煤二、三千万吨，大部被运往德国西部地区。解放后，在设在卡托维茨市的中央煤炭工业部的直接领导下，现已扩建和新建七个矿井、90％采用电力采煤和运送带输送，年产量已达六千万吨。
    解放后，采煤机械化程度逐步提高，这里已有一系列制造采掘和运输煤炭的机器的新型工业。这里不仅设有煤炭工业学校，而且还有近代化的煤炭工业研究所。这个研究所对城下采煤、采用新技术特别是利用水力采煤和新法炼焦等方面，取得了显著的成就。卡托维茨省矿区的成就壮大了波兰的煤炭工业，因而获得了国家最高奖“建设人民波兰”奖章。
    来到卡托维茨城的第二天，我们访问了捷真维特矿井。在老工长的陪同下，我们下到城下八百米的木哈尔茨克掌面，在二年前劳动竞赛中曾获得全国工业一等奖、今年第二季度在全矿区获得二等奖的太特务斯生产队的矿工正在采煤。当我们来到时，青年矿工们紧紧地把我们围起来，回答我们提出的问题。生产队长告诉我们：一般生产队一个劳动日产煤十六吨，他们由于采用新技术和发挥青年的干劲，每一个劳动日可采煤二十一吨。在巷道里，只见挖过煤的掌子里填满着砂子。老工长指着巨型铁管说：这是用来吹砂的。在城市底下挖煤，用填砂来防止塌陷。煤矿工人们懂得利用每一分钟、多产一吨煤的意义。现在，多产煤的竞赛运动正在全矿区掀起。而波兰著名的社会主义劳动竞赛的发起者斯特洛夫斯基，就是这个矿区的工人。
    我们登上地面步出矿场，汽车行驶在矿区的公路上，只见一丛丛浓郁的树林之间，矗立着一幢幢新建的住宅，公路和路旁的水库横贯其间，凉风拂面，空气清爽，使我们忘记了置身在矿区。主人告诉我们：这里的面貌比解放前大大改观了。在卡托维茨市和霍夫城中间，建立了一座很大的文化公园和一座可容十万人的体育场。城北二十公里处，在森林怀抱中，兴建起一座可容十三万钢铁和煤矿工人家庭的诺伏赫特新城，现在已有五万多户搬入新居。城西南四十公里靠近山下，建起了一座可容五百万立方米的大水库，可大量蓄积山水，供应矿区和城市用水，并调节矿区的气候。一座新型的煤都，社会主义的工业城市，在过去被希特勒法西斯蹂躏的土地上昂然矗立起来了，而且其速度之快，真可以与“华沙速度”媲美。
    我们乘火车，途经奥波列省，到了上西里西亚、也是西里西亚的第二个城市伏罗茨瓦夫。到达这个城市的第二天，正是星期日，我们来到靠近捷克斯洛伐克边界的苏台德山区，这里是闻名的游览和避暑胜地。迎着清爽的晨风，透过浓郁的森林，展示在眼前的是清翠的高山、碧绿的河水。斯时斯地，良辰美景，我们饱尝了西里西亚南部山河的景色。汽车沿着公路疾驶前进，车窗外掠过一丛丛的森林，一架架的高压线，每相隔二、三十公里，就出现一座座以工厂为中心的城镇。翻开波兰地图，一眼可以看到西南角上下西里西亚地区，铁路公路密如蛛网，大大小小的几十个城镇，星罗棋布地缀满在交通线上。这里就是五金、机械、化学、造纸工业的基地，这基地大部分是解放后新建的，一部分是在战后重建的。
    第二日，我们参观了伏罗茨瓦夫城最大的工厂——国家车厢制造厂。希特勒法西斯军队溃退时，这工厂的机器全被运走和毁坏了。十五年来，经过扩建和新建，设备一新，给本国和外国制造了十万个车厢，现在每天平均出产二十四个车厢，并开始生产新型的电气机车。工厂的经理告诉我们：近年来工厂发展的最大特点，是在不增加工人的情况下，大大挖掘劳动潜力，降低成本，提高产量。去冬，工厂组织了一次调查，研究了每个工人的工作效率，发现工人只利用了八小时劳动时间的64％。今年发动工人提了一千多条倡议，修改了技术定额，改进了劳动组织，劳动时间的利用率已提高到75％，再加上其他措施，今年上半年比去年同期生产效率提高了40％。这使工人认识到利用每一分钟时间所带来的利益。现在工厂又在进行调查，进一步研究工人怎样利用劳动时间，怎样改进劳动组织。他们相信还可以进一步挖掘劳动潜力。这个强大的潜力，来源于党的领导。这个工厂是贯彻执行波兰统一工人党五中全会指示的一个范例，它给波兰的机器制造业、甚至是所有工业指出了一条挖掘潜力的道路。
    波兰人民用勤劳的双手，正在把西里西亚建设得更加美好。1957年10月，波兰党和政府决定在西里西亚西南角尼斯河畔的图鲁夫地区，兴建一个宏伟的采矿和动力联合中心。现在，这里有六万多工人从事建筑和生产，一个年产六百万吨的露天煤矿还在扩建，一个发电能力一百二十万瓩的巨大发电站，也开始兴建。一座新型的社会主义工业城市，将矗立在波兰、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯伐洛克的三国边界上，为三个国家的社会主义建设提供更多的燃料和动力。
    波兰的工人阶级在建设西里西亚时，也时刻警惕着、保卫着自己的家园。记得我们在卡托维茨一个世代钢铁工人家里作客时，主人在叙述了遭受希特勒法西斯奴役的遭遇，谈到眼前的美好生活时，这位纯朴的壮年工人情不自禁地举起筋肉条条的手臂说：“为了建设美好生活，我们要多产优质钢，帝国主义胆敢侵犯时，我们要用钢铁的武器，狠狠地打碎它的脑袋。”他指着桌旁他的三个儿子告诉我们：“大儿子的志愿是当工程师，中间一个想当海军，小的还没有具体的想法。”对过去辛酸生活的回忆，对眼前美好生活的向往，深深地激励着波兰工人阶级建设和保卫社会主义的决心。（附图片）
