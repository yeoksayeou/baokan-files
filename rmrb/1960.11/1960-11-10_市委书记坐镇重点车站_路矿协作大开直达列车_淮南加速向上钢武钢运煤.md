    From our Hefei dispatch on the 9th: Under the leadership of the Huainan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, coal miners and railway workers in Huainan, Anhui Province, unified their thinking and actions, cooperated closely, and launched a mass movement of "transporting coal quickly, transporting more coal, and ensuring increased steel production," which has led to a continuous increase in the amount of coal transported out of the area. The average daily transport volume in September fulfilled 104.8% of the state plan, an increase of 8.4% compared with August; the average daily transport volume in October increased again compared with September, and the outward transport plan was overfulfilled ahead of schedule.
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, Huainan Coal Mine has seen a substantial increase in coal production. In order to better implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and transport coal to Shanghai, Wuhan Steel, and other regions as soon as possible to ensure a substantial increase in steel production, the Huainan Municipal Party Committee has made coal outward transport one of the city's important transportation tasks. It further mobilized railway and mining workers to accelerate coal transport. Since September, the Municipal Party Committee has held four cooperation meetings attended by railway, mining, and various other responsible persons to specifically help the railway and coal mine rationally arrange coal outward transport plans and loading and unloading forces, and to promptly solve specific problems in coal outward transport. Li Zhenyou, the Secretary of the Huainan Municipal Party Committee in charge of transportation, personally went to the front line of coal transportation, overseeing the Wangfenggang Station, which accounts for more than one-third of the city's coal outward transport volume. He oversaw dispatching, planned work, organized sources of goods and vehicle flow, and frequently went deep into coal yards, mine entrances, and various loading and unloading points to understand the situation, direct operations, and solve problems in a timely manner. In the past, this station generally loaded only about 500 vehicles. Since the Municipal Party Committee further strengthened its leadership, the daily loading volume has rapidly increased and has recently exceeded 620 vehicles. Leading personnel at all levels of the railway and coal mine have also gone deep into stations and freight yards to fight alongside the masses and promote the speed of coal transport.
    In the work of transporting coal outwards, the coal mine and railway departments have demonstrated a good spirit of cooperation. The coal mine actively informs the station of coal production and outward transport, submits vehicle loading plans to the station on time, and makes preparations for loading according to the vehicle arrival plan. The railway department promptly grasps the coal production situation, strengthens dispatching work according to coal production, vehicle flow, and loading and unloading conditions, and ensures that how much is produced, how much is transported. Since September, the railway department has organized 436 fast red flag direct trains (accounting for one-third of the outward coal transport vehicles). These trains achieve fast loading and unloading, fast operation, heavy loads for each vehicle, direct access for each trip, and 100% punctuality, greatly accelerating vehicle turnover.
    In order to transport the coal stored in large mines and the coal from small mines that had not been loaded in the past in a timely manner to support steel production, Huainan City has also vigorously engaged in short-distance coal transportation and made a concentrated effort to clear the coal lying on the ground. In the first and middle ten days of October alone, more than 136,500 tons of stored coal were rushed to transport.

### 市委书记坐镇重点车站　路矿协作大开直达列车  淮南加速向上钢武钢运煤

    市委书记坐镇重点车站　路矿协作大开直达列车
    淮南加速向上钢武钢运煤
    本报合肥9日电　安徽省淮南煤矿和铁路职工在中共淮南市委的领导下，统一思想，统一行动，紧密协作，掀起了一个“快运煤，多运煤，保证钢铁增产”的群众运动，使煤炭外调量不断增加。9月份平均日运量完成国家计划104.8％，比8月份增加8.4％；10月份平均日运量又比9月份增加，提前超额完成了外调计划。
    淮南煤矿在增产节约运动中，煤炭产量大幅度上升。为了更好地贯彻“全国一盘棋”的方针，尽快地把煤炭运往上海、武钢和其他地区，保证钢铁生产大幅度增长，中共淮南市委把煤炭外运作为全市重要运输任务之一，进一步动员路矿职工加速运煤。9月份以来，市委连续召开了四次路矿和各方面负责人参加的协作会议，具体帮助铁路和煤矿合理安排了煤炭外运计划和装卸力量，及时解决了煤炭外运中的具体问题。中共淮南市委分管运输的书记李振友亲临煤炭运输第一线，坐镇占全市煤炭外运量三分之一以上的望峰岗车站，抓调度，抓计划，抓货源和车流的组织工作，并经常深入煤场、井口和各装卸点了解情况，指挥作战，及时解决问题。这个车站过去一般装车仅五百辆左右，自市委进一步加强领导以后，日装车量迅速提高，最近已突破六百二十车。铁路和煤矿的各级领导人员也都深入车站、货场，和群众一起作战，推动加快运煤速度。
    在外运煤炭的工作中，煤矿和铁路部门很好地发挥了协作精神。煤矿主动将煤炭生产和外调情况告诉车站，按时向车站提装车计划，并且根据来车计划作好装车的准备工作。铁路部门则及时掌握煤炭生产情况，根据煤炭生产和车流、装卸情况，加强调度工作，作到产多少、运多少。9月份以来，铁路部门组织了四百三十六列快速红旗直达列车（占外运煤车的三分之一）。这些列车做到了装卸快，运行快，车车重载，趟趟直达，百分之百地正点，大大加速了车辆的周转。
    为了把过去大井未装车的存煤和小井煤都及时运出去，支援钢铁生产，淮南市还大搞煤炭短途运输，突击扫清落地煤。仅10月上中旬就抢运存煤十三万六千五百多吨。
