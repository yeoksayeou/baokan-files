    “Faster!”
    By Ye. Drabkina (Soviet Union)

    It was a Saturday near dusk, a week before the October Revolution holiday. I can't recall why I was running to the Kremlin, when I suddenly saw Vladimir Ilyich and Nadezhda Konstantinovna. They were walking hand in hand, chatting and laughing, looking at the crimson sky at sunset.
      "Come to our place for tea!" Nadezhda Konstantinovna called out to me.
    "And honey," Vladimir Ilyich added, "We're union members, so we got honey!"
    On the way back, they invited several other comrades, and everyone happily headed to "Ilyich's house."
    They drank tea in the kitchen, just like they used to in their apartment on Marie-Rose Street in Paris. The table was still set with mismatched tea sets, and covered with the same oilcloth, full of cracks and chips.
    Vladimir Ilyich had rarely gone out since his injury, and was therefore eager to hear about everything that was happening in various places. And there was so much for everyone to talk about! There was the first conference of the world's first socialist Academy of Social Sciences, the first National Congress of the Communist Youth League, and... so much more—all "firsts"!
    Vladimir Ilyich listened, asked questions, and exchanged happy glances with Nadezhda Konstantinovna. What particularly interested him were the conversations about the masses—for example, a worker from Prokhorovka said: "When the Soviet regime was first established, there was only an empty purse, and barely more than two taels of bread①, but now it allows us to eat until the new grain comes in." A representative from the first congress of female workers said, speaking of herself: "I'm not sewing buttons anymore, I'm going to dedicate myself to organizational work."
    "Going to do organizational work, is that what she said?" Vladimir Ilyich asked again.
    "Interesting, isn't it, Nadya②? So, what kind of woman is she—young? Old?"
    "About twenty-five years old. She has three children, she says she only sees them for two or three hours a month at most, but they're used to it and have been taking care of themselves since they were little."
    Nadezhda Konstantinovna began pouring second cups of tea for everyone. Just then, there was a knock on the door. Nikolai Petrovich Gorbunov, the secretary of the Council of People's Commissars, arrived. He was holding a package wrapped in black silk.
      "Look, Vladimir Ilyich, a comrade from America brought this for you," he said.
    Vladimir Ilyich cut the silk with a knife, opened the envelope, and took out a letter written on thin paper. Everyone continued to sit around the table talking.
    Suddenly, Nadezhda Konstantinovna jumped up from her seat.
      "Volodya, what's wrong?"
    Vladimir's face had turned pale, even his lips were white. Everyone involuntarily looked at his left shoulder, because he still had a bullet from the Socialist-Revolutionary assassination attempt in his shoulder. But he shook his head.
    "No, no, it's nothing,... here, listen to this!" Then he began to read in a low voice:
    San Francisco (California),
    July 4, 1918, in prison.
    To all my comrades and worker brothers in Russia.
    Congratulations, comrades, on your victory in your unremitting efforts and great struggle!
    Eternal respect to you, Russian workers, no matter your misfortune, suffering, or sorrow.
    I want to tell you: I support you with all my heart; although my personal strength is insignificant, I faithfully support you and fervently believe in your great cause.
    Not a day goes by that I don't think about being with you. Your immense strength, your tireless efforts, fill me with heartfelt longing for you.
    All your sincere efforts are for the sake of allowing the suffering, great nation to obtain true freedom.
    For three hundred years, you and your ancestors have suffered under the oppression of barbaric tyrants.
    That alone is enough to inspire you, to drive you toward your goal, to drink from your own fountain of freedom.
    I believe in you, and I am doing my best to follow you forever under the conditions of my current life, but these conditions (which are as they are) do not allow me to do as I wish.
    I grieve for your sorrows, I suffer from your temporary setbacks, and I rejoice when you achieve victory.
    My personal situation is very serious, but that is only a question of how I save myself. I am more concerned that the Russian working class has saved everything in their struggle. They have gained liberation from heavy oppression, freedom from past enslavement, and are now so brilliantly building a free new world.
    I sincerely yearn for you, yearn for your great work, noble actions.
    All your righteous intentions and noble actions are filled with astonishing revolutionary spirit, and I hope that this spirit becomes more powerful and stronger.
    The greatest misfortune of my life is not being able to join you in your glorious work.
    A Russian comrade is returning home to join his country's soldiers in the great work, and I am now entrusting him with this letter.
    I personally handed this letter to him from the "Bastille of San Francisco"③, hoping that you will receive it.
    I hope, and I believe, that you will ultimately achieve a brilliant victory in this undertaking of transforming the new economy.
    From here, from my place of imprisonment, I wholeheartedly extend my brotherly congratulations to you.
    In the cause of liberation from capitalist enslavement, sincerely and like a brother,
    Yours, Tom Mooney
    Vladimir Ilyich finished reading the letter. For a long time, everyone was too moved to speak.
    "When is the execution?" Nadezhda Konstantinovna asked in a hoarse voice.
    "December 12th," Gorbunov replied.
    Tom Mooney, an American socialist, used to be a foundry worker. He was framed and sentenced to death for opposing the war. The authorities insisted that he and his friend Billings had thrown a bomb during a parade in San Francisco in July 1916. For more than two years, workers around the world (including Russian workers) had been demanding the cancellation of the sentence and the release of Mooney.
    "Do you remember, Nadya, when I and Tom Mooney rowed a boat all night in a narrow bay when the Second International Congress was held in Copenhagen?" Vladimir Ilyich asked. "Tom sang American workers' songs, and later we taught him to sing 'The Stevedores' Song'."
    Vladimir Ilyich stood up, walked to the window, looked at the hazy twilight, then turned around.
    "Faster!" he said loudly, agitated. "It seems to me that I would rather sacrifice myself a thousand times, just hoping it would be faster!"
    Everyone understood what he was thinking: he was thinking of the victory of the world proletarian revolution.
    He sat down at the table, picked up his cup, held it in his hand for a while, then put it down, without taking a sip of tea.
    "I'm going to work for an hour or two," he said, standing up.
    Nadezhda Konstantinovna looked at him.
    "Go ahead," she said gently, "I have something to take care of as well."
    She took me and walked to the Rukavishnikov orphanage in the Khamovniki district. Until very late at night, she was still dealing with all sorts of troublesome problems—poor food, tattered bedding, lots of fleas, no firewood or textbooks...

    ① The original text is "a quarter of a pound of bread."
      Each Russian pound is approximately 0.41 kilograms.
    ② Affectionate name for Nadezhda.
    ③ Bastille, a prison in Paris that
      imprisoned revolutionary people before
      the French Revolution in 1789.

### “快一些！”

    “快一些！”
    苏联  叶·德拉伯金娜
    这是十月革命节前的一个星期六，将近傍晚的时候。我已不记得为了什么事，向克里姆林宫里跑过去，却突然看见了弗拉基米尔·伊里奇和娜捷日达·康斯坦丁诺夫娜。他们手搀着手走，一面谈笑，一面看日落时淡红的天空。
      “上我们那儿喝茶去吧！”娜捷日达·康斯坦丁诺夫娜向我大声说。
    “还有蜂蜜，”弗拉基米尔·伊里奇接着说，“我们是工会会员，所以领到了蜂蜜！”
    在归途中，他们又邀了几位同志，大伙儿都高高兴兴地往“伊里奇家”走去。
    他们在厨房里喝茶，完全像从前在巴黎的玛丽—罗斯街的寓所里一样。桌上摆的仍旧是那些七拼八凑的茶具，铺的仍旧是那块满是裂缝和缺口的漆布。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇自从受伤以后，很少出外，因此急切地询问各地发生的一切事情。而大伙儿要说的事也真多！有全世界第一个社会主义社会科学院召开的第一次大会，有第一届青年团代表大会，还有……多着啦——都是“第一的”！
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇一面听，一面提出问题，很高兴地和娜捷日达·康斯坦丁诺夫娜互使眼色。特别使他感到兴趣的，是有关群众的一些谈话——比如，普罗霍夫卡的一个工人说：“苏维埃政权刚成立的时候，只有一只空钱袋，甚至只有二两多面包①，但是，现在它使我们能够一直吃到新谷登场了。”女工第一届代表大会的一位代表，谈到她自己的时候说：“我不再缝钮子了，要全心全意地去搞组织工作。”
    “去搞组织工作，她是这样说的吗？”弗拉基米尔·伊里奇反问了一句。
    “真有趣，你说是吗，娜佳②？那末，这个妇女是个什么样的人——年纪还轻吗？年纪老了吗？”
    “二十五岁左右。有三个孩子，她说，一个月里最多看见他们两三小时，但是他们已经习惯了，从小起就会照管自己。”
    娜捷日达·康斯坦丁诺夫娜开始为每个人斟上第二杯茶。这时传来了叩门声。人民委员会书记尼古拉伊·彼特罗维奇·戈尔巴诺夫来了。他手里拿着一个黑绸子缝的包裹。
      “瞧，弗拉基米尔·伊里奇，这是一位从美国来的同志带给您的，”他说。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇用小刀割破了绸子，拆开了信封，取出了一封薄纸写的信。大伙儿仍旧坐在桌子旁边谈话。
    突然，娜捷日达·康斯坦丁诺夫娜从位子上跳了起来。
      “沃洛佳，你怎么啦？”
    弗拉基米尔的面色变得苍白，连嘴唇都白了。大伙儿都不由自主地去看他的左肩，因为他肩膀还留着社会革命党人射击的那一粒子弹。但是他摇了摇头。
    “不，不，没有关系，……喏，你们听听！”于是他开始压低了声音念道：
    旧金山（加利福尼亚州），
    1918年7月4日在监狱里。
    给我所有在俄国的同志们和工人兄弟们。
    祝贺你们，同志们，在你们不懈的努力和伟大的斗争中获得了胜利！
    永远向你们致敬，俄国工人们，不论你们在灾祸里，在苦难里，在悲哀里。
    我要向你们说：我全心全意地支持你们；虽然我个人的力量是微不足道的，但是，我忠诚地拥护你们，热烈地相信你们的伟大的事业。
    我没有一天不想到我是和你们在一起的。你们巨大的力量，你们的不懈的努力，使我衷心向往着你们。
    你们的一切真诚的努力，为的是要让受苦难的伟大的民族获得真正的自由。
    三百年来，你们和你们的祖先在野蛮的暴君的压迫下受苦。
    仅仅这一点，已经足够激发你们，使你们走向自己的目标，去喝自己的自由泉源中的水。
    我信仰你们，我在目前的生活条件许可下，竭力要永远跟着你们走，可是，这些条件（它们就是这样）却不允许我照着自己的意思去做。
    我为你们的悲哀感到悲哀，为你们暂时的挫折感到痛苦，也在你们获得胜利的时候欢欣鼓舞。
    我个人的情况是非常严重的，但这只是我怎样拯救自己的问题。我更关心的是：俄国的工人阶级在他们的斗争中拯救了一切。他们从沉重的压迫下获得解放，从过去的奴役中获得自由，现在正是那么光辉灿烂地建设一个自由的新世界。
    我衷心向往着你们，向往着你们伟大的工作，高尚的行动。
    你们一切正直的意图和高尚的行动，都充满了惊人的革命精神，我希望这种精神变得更加有力，更加坚强。
    我一生中最大的不幸，就是不能够和你们在一起参加你们光荣的工作。
    一位俄国同志回国，去和他本国的战士们一起参加伟大的工作，我现在托他带上这一封信。
    我亲自把这封信从“旧金山的巴士底”③交给他，希望你们能够收到它。
    我希望，并且相信，你们在改造新的经济这一事业中，最后将获得辉煌的胜利。
    我从这里，从我监禁的地方，衷心地向你们致兄弟般的祝贺。
    在摆脱资本主义奴役的解放事
    业中，诚心诚意地、像兄弟般
    属于你们的　汤姆·穆尼
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇念完了信。大伙儿半天激动得说不出话来。
    “什么时候执行死刑？”娜捷日达·康斯坦丁诺夫娜沙哑着嗓子问。
    “12月12日，”戈尔巴诺夫回答。
    美国社会党人汤姆·穆尼，过去是一个铸工。他由于反对战争，受到陷害，被判死刑。当局硬说：1916年7月，在旧金山举行阅兵的时候，他和他的朋友比林斯一起投了一颗炸弹。经过了两年多的时间，全世界工人（包括俄国工人）都要求取消这一判决，释放穆尼。
    “你可记得，娜佳，在哥本哈根召开第二国际大会的时候，我和汤姆·穆尼在狭窄的海湾里整整划了一夜的船吗？”弗拉基米尔·伊里奇问，“汤姆唱美国工人唱的歌，后来我们教他唱《船夫卸货歌》。”
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇站起来，走到窗口，看了看朦胧的暮色，接着转过身来。
    “快一些吧！”他激动地大声说，“这样看来，我宁可牺牲一千次，只希望它快一些！”
    大伙儿都明白他所想到的是什么：他想到的是全世界无产阶级革命的胜利。
    他坐在桌子旁边，拿起杯子，在手里端了一会儿，又放下，一口茶也没有喝。
    “我去工作一两小时，”他说，一面站起身来。
    娜捷日达·康斯坦丁诺夫娜望着他。
    “你去吧，”她温和地说，“我也有一件事要去办。”
    她带着我，步行到哈莫夫尼基区鲁卡维什尼科夫孤儿院去。一直到晚上很迟的时候，她还在那里处理种种伤脑筋的问题——粗劣的饮食，破烂的被褥，跳蚤很多，没有柴火和课本……
    ①原文是“四分之一斤面包。”
      每俄斤约合零点四一公斤。
    ②娜捷日达的爱称。
    ③巴士底，1789年法国革命前，
      巴黎的一所囚禁革命人民的
      监狱。
