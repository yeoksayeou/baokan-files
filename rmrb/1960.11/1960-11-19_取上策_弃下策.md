Regarding equipment maintenance and repair, there are various approaches. One approach is to understand the patterns of equipment ailments and prevent problems before they occur. Like the workers of the Jinzhou Railway Bureau, they "delve into the heart and dissect the abdomen" before the illness manifests, checking for hidden dangers and preventing diseases. This is the best strategy. The second approach is to promptly discover and treat ailments when they occur, preventing minor problems from becoming major ones. This is a moderate strategy. The third approach is to ignore ailments after they occur, allowing equipment to operate while sick, and not treating it until absolutely necessary. This results in minor problems becoming major ones, and treatable conditions becoming incurable ones. This is the worst strategy. The best and moderate strategies involve consciously solving problems, thus being proactive. The worst strategy involves being forced to solve problems only after they accumulate, thus being passive. Being proactive in everything leads to victory. One of the most important measures to ensure that enterprises consistently have high-quality equipment and that production proceeds smoothly is to frequently and proactively inspect and maintain equipment.

    取上策
    弃下策
    对待设备维护检修，有各种各样的做法。一种是掌握设备病患的规律，防患于未然。就像锦州铁路局职工那样，在病患未发作之前，就“钻心剖腹”，查隐患，防疾病。这是上策。第二种是病患发生了，及时发现，及时治疗，不使小病变成大病。这是中策。第三种是病患发生后，置若罔闻，让设备带病工作，不到万不得已不治疗，结果小病变成大病，可治之症变成不治之症。这是下策。上策和中策，是自觉地解决问题，故主动；下策是问题成堆才被迫解决，故被动。凡事主动，便能胜利。要使企业经常拥有质量良好的设备，保证生产经常顺利地进行，最重要的措施之一就是经常主动地检修保养设备。
