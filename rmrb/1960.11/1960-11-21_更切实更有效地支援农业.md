    Supporting Agriculture More Practically and Effectively
    Yang Yilin, Secretary of the CPC Yangzhou Prefectural Committee Secretariat
    Since the Central Committee of the Party issued the call to accelerate agricultural technological transformation last year, the mass movement of urban support for rural areas and industrial support for agriculture in our Yangzhou Prefecture has developed in scale, form, and content more than in any previous year. As the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation has taken root, the consciousness and initiative of the vast number of cadres and the masses in supporting agriculture have been greatly enhanced. Not only have the units directly serving agricultural production taken active action, but also those units that originally thought that "supporting agriculture has little to do with them" have also participated in the movement. All walks of life have tried their best to contribute to the large-scale development of agriculture and grain production, setting off a competition craze of "comparing who contributes the most to supporting agriculture."
    The vast number of workers and staff on the industrial front, closely focused on improving agricultural labor productivity and increasing grain production, have practically supported agricultural technological transformation in the repair and manufacture of small and medium-sized farm tools, agricultural machinery, and the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In the past ten months, 6.41 million new farm tools of various types have been manufactured, and 2.5 million farm tools of various types have been repaired, an increase of about 30% compared to last year. More than 300,000 pieces of more than 20 types of new farm tools have been trial-produced and promoted, making the labor-intensive rice threshing basically semi-mechanized. At the same time, the task of repairing water pumps was completed a quarter ahead of schedule, more than 6,000 horsepower of new power equipment was manufactured, and the farmland electrical irrigation network was expanded, making nearly 60% of the region's rice fields achieve mechanized and electrical irrigation. Especially since the beginning of this year, factories and enterprises, through technological revolution, have transferred a large number of cadres, workers, technical forces, machinery and equipment to the countryside, and basically established a farm tool and agricultural machinery repair and assembly network in various counties and communes throughout the region.
    All of this has provided favorable material and technical conditions for saving labor, overcoming natural disasters, and increasing grain production. Under this new situation, practical work has raised a new problem that urgently needs to be solved, that is, how to make full use of these favorable conditions and more practically and effectively play the important role of industrial support for agriculture, so that industrial support can achieve greater practical results in the development of agricultural production. Recently, in summarizing the work of supporting agriculture over the past year and formulating plans for this winter and next spring, we have conducted some investigations and research on this issue, focusing on the production of agricultural machinery and tools. Based on the practice of various regions, we have the following points of experience:
    Concentrate Efforts to First Grasp the Key
    To give full play to the role of industrial support for agriculture, it is necessary to proceed from the characteristics of the region, according to needs and possibilities, adapting to local conditions and adapting to the times. This includes two aspects: first, in the steps of promoting agricultural mechanization, we must first concentrate our efforts on solving the key problems that have the greatest impact on agricultural production and grain production, and that require the most labor; second, when manufacturing and promoting new agricultural machinery and tools, we must pay attention to the characteristics of the region's natural conditions, crop varieties, cultivation systems, and mass habits. If these two problems are solved well, significant results can be achieved.
    Taking our prefecture's solution to the problem of farmland drainage and irrigation as an example of the steps in promoting agricultural mechanization. The main crops in our prefecture are wheat and rice. In terms of natural conditions, there are hilly and mountainous areas, miscellaneous grain plains, and water network areas. No matter which area it is, the first key to increasing grain production is "water." The Lixiahe area is low-lying and often suffers from waterlogging; the Yiyang Mountain area is high and suffers from drought every year; the miscellaneous grain area needs to prevent both drought and waterlogging. Since liberation, with the strong support of the state, although the drainage and irrigation machinery and equipment in the region have increased year by year, they are still far from meeting the needs of agricultural production. Therefore, the first thing our industry supports agriculture in is to help agriculture solve the problem of drainage and irrigation. From last year to this year, we concentrated our efforts to build a power plant with two 12,000-kilowatt generators, manufactured a large number of electromechanical drainage and irrigation equipment, and universally reformed human, animal, and wind-powered waterwheels. As a result, the power of drainage and irrigation machinery this year reached about 70,000 horsepower, and the area of electromechanical irrigation accounted for about 60% of the area of rice fields. Coupled with wind power and gravity irrigation, about 80% of wheat and rice fields have been freed from manual labor in terms of drainage and irrigation, saving more than 100,000 laborers and ensuring timely sowing and normal drainage and irrigation of wheat and rice, which has been widely praised by the broad masses of peasants. The peasants praised: "Without electromechanical irrigation, rice and wheat depend on the sky; with electromechanical irrigation, we don't have to worry about drought or flood. Industry supports agriculture with many good things, and this one counts as the first."
    In the manufacturing and promotion of new agricultural tools, taking drainage and irrigation machinery as an example, we also paid attention to the characteristics of the natural conditions of each region according to the principle of adapting to local conditions. In the Lixiahe area, because the river network is crisscrossed, the banks are narrow, and the cultivated land is formed into embankments and piles, if large-scale stationary machines are used, it is inconvenient to install, inconvenient to move, and cannot fully exert the efficiency of the machines. We promoted pumping boats and small 10-horsepower drainage and irrigation machinery, which can flow along the river bank into the harbor for drainage and irrigation on the water, and can be dragged by two people on the shore, which is convenient for movement and fully exerts the efficiency of the machines. In the plains and mountainous areas, because the land is high and the water is low, and the cultivated land is in large tracts, we promoted large-scale pumping machines of 30 to 50 horsepower or more, and established pumping stations, so that drainage and irrigation machinery can supply the needs of large-area drainage and irrigation, and can draw low river water to high fields. This ensures the needs of different regions. In the promotion of other new agricultural tools, we also adhered to the principle of adapting to local conditions, and produced various specifications and models of tools for paddy fields, mountainous areas, and plains. There are more than 30 different specifications of ploughshares in the whole region.
    Meet Current Rural Needs and Possibilities
    Another important symbol for measuring the practical effect of industrial support for agriculture is to see whether the tools and equipment supported by industry truly meet the current rural conditions and the needs of agricultural production. This requires conscientiously implementing the policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining professional teams and mass movements, and combining large, medium and small, and opposing all one-sided ideas and practices. Although the industrial production in our prefecture has made great progress in the past few years, the industrial foundation is still relatively weak; although the newly built agricultural machinery and farm tool factories have manufactured a large number of agricultural machinery and tools, they have not yet been fully equipped; the agricultural machinery and tools currently produced, both in terms of quantity, variety, and specifications, are far from meeting the needs of agricultural technological transformation. At the same time, accelerating the realization of agricultural technological transformation and agricultural mechanization is bound to have a process from low to high, which cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, only by implementing "three combinations" and taking the mass line can we effectively promote the development of current agricultural production and gradually accelerate the process of agricultural mechanization.
    Conscientiously implementing the policy of "from indigenous to foreign, combining indigenous and foreign" is an important issue for supporting agricultural technological transformation in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. We advocate using indigenous methods where possible, using foreign methods where possible, mobilizing the masses, using local materials, and vigorously developing various indigenous machinery, from indigenous to foreign. As a result, many problems that industrial departments cannot solve or cannot solve for the time being have been solved. For example, when we vigorously developed mechanical threshing tools, the first problem we encountered was the power of the machinery, which could not all be powered by electricity and machinery. According to local conditions, we used electricity where there was electricity, machinery where there was machinery, and wind power, water power, and animal power where there was no machinery and electricity, so that the region basically realized the semi-mechanization and mechanization of threshing tools under the condition of insufficient mechanical and electrical power. Taizhou County used a total of 3,706 threshing machines in the autumn harvest threshing this year, and more than 80% of the rice threshing was semi-mechanized and mechanized. Among these 3,706 threshing machines, 2,560 were foot-operated, 533 were wind-powered, 495 were developed from foot-operated to motorized, and 118 were developed to electric. All kinds of threshing machines have improved work efficiency. Foot-operated improved work efficiency by one time, bull-drawn improved work efficiency by one and a half times, motorized improved work efficiency by three times, and electric improved work efficiency by five times, which not only saved 940,000 workdays, but also advanced the progress of autumn harvest and autumn planting by ten days respectively, which fully demonstrated the power of from indigenous to foreign, and combining indigenous and foreign.
    On the issue of combining professional teams and mass movements, we mainly focus on two points: one is that the factories themselves first take the new agricultural tools they manufacture and imitate from other places to the masses for testing, improve them according to the opinions of the masses, and then test them again, improve them again, until the masses approve them before promoting them. The other point is to summarize the sprouts of mass inventions and creations in a timely manner, and help improve, promote, and promote them. Wherever this is done, the improvement of agricultural tools is done very well because it relies on the wisdom and strength of the masses, and agricultural machinery with less material, high work efficiency, and simple construction is created. Since the beginning of this year, Jiangdu County has combined workers and peasants to invent and create more than 20 kinds of tools, and 19 kinds have been promoted and used. The paddy field tractor that is being manufactured and promoted is the result of a clever farmer and workers from the county's General Machinery Factory in Xiaoji Commune working together to trial-produce. This paddy field tractor, which was originally manufactured by farmers, was originally foot-operated and not flexible enough. After the workers of the County General Machinery Factory and Farm Tool Factory discovered this sprout, they immediately took the initiative to study with the peasants, repeatedly experimented, and worked for more than 100 days, experimented more than 80 times, first solved the technical problems of the tractor's forward, backward, and turning, and further changed from manual foot-operated to machine-powered, so that the tractor not only has the characteristics of being light, flexible, simple in structure, and easy to manufacture, but also its daily cultivation efficiency is more than 20 times higher than that of manual labor, freeing farmers from the pain of wading in water for winter plowing and ice-cold pricking for thousands of years, and creating a good start for the realization of agricultural tillage mechanization in paddy fields.
    The process of agricultural production is complex, the projects are diversified, and the regional conditions are different. It not only needs large-scale agricultural tools, but also needs a large number of medium and small agricultural tools. Therefore, the repair and production of medium and small agricultural tools cannot be relaxed. Since the beginning of this year, according to the principle of combining large, medium and small and combining new and old, we have determined that commune industries mainly produce and repair medium and small agricultural tools and original agricultural tools, and municipal and county agricultural machinery factories mainly produce large-scale agricultural tools and large and medium-sized agricultural machinery. According to the needs of the season, we make overall plans and unified arrangements. While producing a large number of new agricultural tools and large-scale agricultural tools, we produce enough medium and small agricultural tools, which basically meet the requirements of the agricultural season. In particular, iron small agricultural tools such as sickles and hoes and wooden small agricultural tools such as waterwheel sweeps are supplied in a timely manner and have a certain amount of stock, ensuring the most common needs of agricultural production.
          Responsible to the End
    Further strengthening the industrial departments' point of view of being responsible to the end is the key to continuously improving the effect of supporting agriculture and continuously improving the efficiency of agricultural machinery and tools, and it is also an important symbol for measuring the degree of consciousness of industrial departments in supporting agriculture. The so-called being responsible to the end means grasping the repair, manufacture, use, and management in an all-round way. Industrial departments are not only responsible for production, but also actively responsible for repair, imparting technology, ensuring normal use, and helping to establish a management system. This is a higher requirement put forward to industrial departments to support agriculture more effectively under the new situation. First of all, in terms of repair, in the past two years, the agricultural tools and machinery produced have increased year by year. Due to the continuous improvement of the degree of intensive farming, the utilization rate of agricultural machinery has also greatly increased, and the corresponding loss rate has also increased accordingly. Timely repairs can greatly save manpower, materials, and financial resources, and make a large number of agricultural machinery and tools give full play to their effectiveness. Secondly, in terms of use and management, especially new agricultural tools and agricultural machinery, it is necessary to master certain technologies, and industrial departments must manage both manufacturing and use, and provide all-inclusive teaching and learning. Not only must farmers understand how to use them, but also understand how to repair and maintain them, so as to prolong the life of agricultural machinery and tools and improve efficiency. These tasks are put forward under the new situation of the continuous improvement of the degree of agricultural mechanization and the large-scale collective and large-scale production in rural areas. However, some units believe that "the task of industrial departments is to manufacture. Promotion, use, and management are the business of agricultural departments." Some seem to have quite reasonable proposals such as "If industrial departments grasp the use and management again, it will disperse their forces and affect the completion of the production plan." In response to these situations, we repeatedly clarified the truth by accounting and comparing; on the one hand, we strengthened enterprise management in factories, established and improved the economic accounting system, reduced costs, and firmly grasped specifications and quality. Inferior specifications and quality are resolutely not allowed to leave the factory, so that workers are satisfied, factories are satisfied, and farmers are satisfied. In order to strengthen the repair and assembly work of agricultural machinery and tools, industrial departments often organize technical forces to go to the countryside, go deep into the fields and fields, help inspect and repair agricultural machinery and tools, and help establish maintenance and management systems, so that the damage rate is reduced and the utilization rate is improved. We also transferred more than 1,900 technical workers and more than 1,500 sets of machinery and equipment to arm county and commune industries technically and equipment-wise, and helped rural areas establish agricultural machinery and tool repair and assembly networks.
    After summarizing the work of the past year, we have a deeper understanding that the fundamental key to industrial departments supporting agriculture still lies in continuously improving consciousness and continuously strengthening the production point of view and strengthening the mass point of view. Everything starts from agricultural production and starts from the needs and possibilities of the masses. Support that meets the requirements of production and the needs of the masses is the most practical and effective support. On this issue, there will still be a relatively long-term and complex ideological struggle, and we are determined to resolutely implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and continue to improve the work of supporting agriculture.

    更切实更有效地支援农业
    中共扬州地委书记处书记　杨易林
    自从去年党中央发出了加速农业技术改造的号召以后，一年来，我们扬州专区城市支援农村，工业支援农业的群众运动，无论在规模上、形式上、内容上都比以往任何一年有了发展。随着以农业为基础的思想深入人心，广大干部和群众支援农业的自觉性、主动性大大提高了，不仅直接为农业生产服务的单位积极行动起来，那些本来认为“支援农业与自己关系不大的”单位也参加了运动，各行各业千方百计地为大办农业、大办粮食出力，掀起了一个“比谁支援农业贡献大”的竞赛热潮。
    工业战线上的广大职工，紧紧围绕提高农业劳动生产率和增产粮食，在修配制造中小农具、农业机械和生产化肥农药等方面，切实支援了农业技术改造。十个月来，新制了各种农具六百四十一万件，整修了各种农具二百五十万件，比去年增加了30％左右；试制推广了新式农具二十多种三十多万件，使花费劳力较多的水稻脱粒基本上实现了半机械化。同时，提前一个季度完成了抽水机的修理任务，新制了动力设备六千多马力，扩建了农田电灌网，使全区近60％的水稻田实现了机电灌溉。特别是今年以来工厂企业通过技术革命，抽调了大批的干部、工人、技术力量、机器设备送往农村，在全区各县各公社基本上建成了农具农机修配网。
    所有这一切，都为节约劳动力，战胜自然灾害，增产粮食，提供了有利的物质技术条件。在这个新形势下，实际工作又向我们提出了一个急待解决的新问题，这就是如何充分利用这些有利条件，更切实、更有效地发挥工业支援农业的重要作用，使工业的支援能够在发展农业生产上取得更大的实际效果。最近我们在总结一年支援农业工作，制订今冬明春规划的过程中，以生产农机农具为中心，就这个问题作了一些调查研究，根据各地的实践，有如下几点体会：
    集中力量先抓关键
    要充分发挥工业支援农业的作用，必须根据本地区的特点，根据需要和可能，因地制宜，因时制宜。这包括两个方面：其一是在推进农业机械化的步骤上，首先要集中力量解决对农业增产作用最大，而花费劳力最多的关键问题；其二是在制造和推广新农业机具时，必须注意本地区的自然条件、作物品种、耕作制度、群众习惯等特点。这两个问题如果解决得好，就能取得显著效果。
    在推进农业机械步骤上，以我们专区解决农田排灌的问题为例。我们专区的农作物主要是三麦和水稻。在自然条件上，有丘陵山区、有杂谷平原、有水网地区，不论是那一种地区，增产粮食的第一个关键都是“水”。里下河地区地势低洼，经常受水多成涝的影响；仪扬山区地势高，年年受无水干旱的威胁；杂谷地区既要防旱又要防涝。解放几年来，在国家大力支持下，虽然全区排灌机械设备逐年增加，但还远远不能适应农业生产的需要。因此，我们工业在支援农业方面，首先就是支援农业解决排灌问题。从去年到今年，我们集中力量，兴建了一座两台一点二万瓩电机的电厂，制造了大批的机电排灌设备，普遍改革了人、畜、风力水车。使今年的排灌机械动力达到七万多马力左右，机电灌面积占到水稻田面积的60％左右。加上风车和自流灌溉，有80％左右的三麦、水稻田，在排灌方面摆脱了手工劳动，节约了十多万个劳动力，保证了三麦、水稻播种及时，排灌正常，得到了广大农民的普遍赞扬。农民歌颂说：“没有机电灌，稻麦望天收，有了机电灌，水旱都不愁，工业支农好事多，这件事要算头一个。”
    在制造和推广新式农具上，以排灌机械为例，我们也根据因地制宜的原则，注意各个地区自然条件的特点。在里下河地区，由于河网纵横，岸埂狭窄，耕地成圩成垛，若用大型座机，则不便安装、不便移动、不能充分发挥机器的效率。我们就推广了抽水机船和小型的十马力的排灌机械，在水上能沿河岸入港口流动排灌，在岸上能两个人拖了就跑，便于移动，充分发挥了机器效率。在平原和山区，由于地高水低，耕地成片，我们就推广了三十到五十马力以上的大型抽水机，建立了抽水机站，使排灌机械能供应大面积排灌需要，能吸低下的河水引到高田来。这样就保证了不同地区的需要。在其他新农具的推广方面，我们也坚持了因地制宜的原则，分水田、山区、平原，生产了各种不同规格型号的工具，单犁头全区就有三十多种不同的规格。
    切合当前农村需要与可能
    衡量工业支援农业实际效果的另一个重要标志，就是看工业所支援的工具设备，是否真正切合当前农村条件的可能和农业生产的需要。这就必须认真地贯彻两条腿走路的方针，实行土洋结合、专业队伍和群众运动相结合，大中小结合，反对一切片面的思想和作法。几年来，我们专区工业生产虽然有了很大的发展，但是工业基础还是比较薄弱的；新建的农业机械和农具工厂虽然制造了大批的农业机具，但还没有配套成龙；现在生产的农业机具，不论在数量上、品种上、规格上都还远远不能满足农业技术改造的需要。同时，加速实现农业技术改造，实现农业机械化，必然还有一个由低到高的过程，不是一朝一夕所能实现的。因此只有实行“三个结合”，大走群众路线，才能一方面切实有效地促进当前农业生产的发展，又能逐步加快农业机械化的过程。
    认真贯彻“由土到洋，土洋并举”的方针，是多快好省地支援农业技术改造的一个重要问题。我们提倡能土则土，能洋则洋，发动群众，就地取材，大搞各种土机械，由土到洋。这样做的结果，使许多工业部门不能解决的或者一时解决不了的问题解决了。例如我们大搞机械脱粒工具时，首先碰到是机具的动力问题，不可能全部都用电力和机械。我们根据各地条件，有电力的就用电，有机器的用机器，没有机器和电的就用风力、水力和畜力，因而使全区在机电动力不足的情况下，基本上实现了脱粒工具半机械化和机械化。太州县今年秋收脱粒中，共使用了三千七百零六部脱粒机，80％以上的水稻脱粒都半机械化和机械化了。在这三千七百零六部脱粒机当中，脚踏的二千五百六十部，风力的五百三十三部，由脚踏发展为机动的四百九十五部，发展为电动的一百一十八部，无论那种脱粒机都提高了工效。脚踏提高工效一倍，牛拉提高工效一倍半，机动提高工效三倍，电动提高工效五倍，不仅节约了九十四万个劳动日，而且使秋收秋播进度分别提前十天，这就充分地显示了由土到洋，土洋结合的威力。
    在专业队伍和群众运动相结合的问题上，我们主要是抓住两点：一是工厂本身把自己制造的和仿制外地的新式农具，首先拿到群众中去进行试验，根据群众的意见进行改进，改进后再试验，再改进，直到群众鉴定合格才推广。另一点是，及时总结群众发明创造的萌芽，帮助改进、提高和推广。凡是这样做的地区，由于依靠了群众的智慧和力量，改良农具就搞得很好，创造了用材少、工效高、构制简易的农业机械。江都县今年来由工人和农民结合，发明创造的工具就有二十多种，推广使用的有十九种。正在制造推广的水田拖拉机，就是这个县小纪公社一个巧农民和县通用机械厂工人一起试制成功的。这部开始由农民制造的水田拖拉机，原来是用脚踏，不够灵活。县通用机械厂和农具厂工人发现这个萌芽之后，随即主动和农民一道研究，反复试验，搞了一百多天，试验八十多次，先解决了拖拉机的前进、后退、转弯等技术问题，又进一步由人工脚踏改为机器做动力，使拖拉机不仅具有轻便灵活、结构简单、容易制造等特点，而且日耕效率比人工提高二十多倍，解除了几千年来农民涉水冬耕、冰寒刺骨的痛苦，并为水田实现农业耕作机械化创造了良好的开端。
    农业生产的过程复杂，项目多样化，地区条件不同，不仅需要大型农具，更需要大量的中小农具，因此对中小农具的修配生产不能放松。今年以来，我们根据大中小并举和新旧并举的原则，确定公社工业主要生产和修配中小农具和原有农具，市和县的农业机械厂主要生产大型农具和大中型农业机械。根据季节的需要，统筹规划，统一安排，在生产大批新农具和大型农具的同时，生产了足够的中小农具，基本上满足了农时季节的要求，特别是镰刀、锄头等铁制小农具和水车用的拂榷等木制小农具，做到了供应及时，有一定备货，保证了农业生产上最普遍的需要。
          负责到底
    进一步加强工业部门负责到底的观点，是不断提高支援农业的效果，不断提高农机具使用效率的关键，同时也是衡量工业部门支援农业自觉性程度的一个重要标志。所谓负责到底，就是修、制、用、管全面抓起来，工业部门不单是负责生产，还要积极负责修理、传授技术，保证正常使用，帮助建立保管制度。这是在新的情况下，对工业部门更有效地支援农业提出的更高的要求。首先在修的方面，近两年来，生产的农具机械逐年有所增加，由于农业精耕细作程度不断提高，农业机械利用率也大大提高，随之而来的损耗率也相应加大。及时进行修理，就可以大大节约人力、物力、财力，使大批的农业机具充分发挥效用。其次，在使用和管理方面，特别是新式农具和农业机械都需要掌握一定的技术，工业部门就必须管造又管用，包教包学。不仅使农民懂得使用，而且懂得维修和保管，这样才能延长农机农具寿命，提高效率。这些任务，都是在农业机械化程度不断提高，农村的大集体、大生产的新形势下提出来的。但是有些单位却认为“工业部门任务就是制造。推广、使用、保管，是农业部门的事”。有些似乎还颇有道理的提出“工业部门再抓使用、保管，就会分散力量，影响生产计划的完成。”针对这些情况，我们一面通过算账、对比，反复讲清道理；一方面在工厂中加强企业管理，建立和健全经济核算制度，降低成本，狠抓规格质量，不合规格质量的坚决不准出厂，做到工人满意，工厂满意，农民满意。为了加强农机具的修配工作，工业部门经常组织技术力量下乡，深入田头、场头，帮助检修农机具，帮助建立维修管理制度，使损坏率减少，使用率提高。我们还抽调了一千九百余名技术工人，一千五百多台机器设备，从技术上、设备上武装了县社工业，帮助农村建立了农机机具修配网。
    经过对一年来工作的总结，我们更深刻地体会到，工业部门支援农业的根本关键，仍在于不断提高自觉性，不断地加强生产观点，加强群众观点。一切从农业生产出发，从群众的需要与可能出发。符合生产要求和群众需要的支援，就是最切实、最有效的支援。在这个问题上，仍将是一场比较长期的复杂的思想斗争，我们决心坚决贯彻以农业为基础的方针，把支援农业的工作继续提高一步。
