Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 2nd. More than 800 people from Pyongyang press circles held a gathering at the Moranbong Theater on the evening of November 1st to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of "Rodong Sinmun," the central organ of the Workers' Party of Korea.

Kim Chang-man, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Hong Myong-hui and Ri Joo-yeon, Director of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party Kim Do-man, and heads of various news agencies in Korea attended the conference.

Heo Seok-seon, Editor-in-Chief of "Rodong Sinmun," delivered a report at the meeting. He said that "Rodong Sinmun" has always held high the banner of the Party, educating all Party members and the masses with the great thought of the Party, and uniting them firmly around the Party Central Committee, playing and continuing to play a huge organizing and educating role in the struggle to defend and implement policies and lines.

He said that boundless loyalty to the Party's policies, and the tenacity and determination to struggle to implement the Party's intentions, are the source of the noble political ideology and combat effectiveness of our Party's newspapers and periodicals. Our reporters, together with all the people, maintain a high degree of vigilance, consistently pay attention to the enemy's every move, concentrate their efforts to expose the nature of the U.S. imperialist aggressors, and organize and mobilize the people to fight against U.S. imperialism and strive for the reunification of the motherland.

He said that our Party's newspapers and periodicals have progressively exposed and shattered the ugly nature of the international revisionists headed by the Yugoslav Tito clique, defended the principles of Marxism-Leninism, held high the banner of proletarian internationalism, and actively defended the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

On the same day, "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial entitled "A Powerful Ideological Weapon of the Party" to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of "Rodong Sinmun."
