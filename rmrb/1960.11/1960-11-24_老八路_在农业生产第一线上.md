"Old Eighth Route Army" on the Front Line of Agricultural Production

    The Old Banner Bearer on Dabie Mountain

    Guo Jibao, an old Red Army soldier from Guojiahe, Xin County, Henan, transferred from the army to the agricultural production front. For more than ten years, he has been named a model worker seventy-two times and is known as the old banner bearer on Dabie Mountain. Although he is over sixty years old, the old general is as brave as he was in his youth, always leading the way for others.

    In one drought resistance effort, he carted water to irrigate the land from morning till night, just like the young people. As the drought became more and more severe, the river dried up, and the ponds were also empty. No usable water could be found on the ground. At this time, there were still over a hundred mu of land that had not been irrigated. Just as branch secretary Guo Jibao and the commune members were worried, the county party committee issued instructions to dig mountain springs. However, the young people here had never dug springs, and the older people were not very confident in digging springs. Guo Jibao went to the old Red Guards of that year and said, "Old comrades, it's time for us to take the lead again!" Old Red Guard Hu Mingtang said, "Okay! There are ancient wells on Daoren Mountain, maybe there are springs there." That night, the four old Red Guards, carrying hoes, dry rations, and lanterns, went up Daoren Mountain.

    This Daoren Mountain is located in the southwest of Guojiahe Village, with steep slopes and grotesque rocks. They followed the mountain gully, climbed the stone cracks, and slowly climbed up, when suddenly they found a place where the grass was lush and the soil was moist. Guo Jibao said, "I remember water splashing out here before. When I was grazing cattle, I also drank water here. Let's try here first." The four of them started digging. When they dug to the depth of a person, a clear spring of water suddenly gushed out with water splashes. Guo Jibao was so happy that he ran back to report the news to everyone before dawn, and the entire brigade quickly launched a spring-finding competition. Guo Jibao returned and said to his three old partners, "Old comrades, the party branch calls on every party member to find three springs. Our old Red Guards must overfulfill the task." So, they lived on the mountain for five days and dug a total of thirty-two springs, and also built a small canal to converge the spring water into a stream, flowing to the dry rice fields.

    High Mountains Cannot Block the Path of Revolutionary Fighters

    Zhou Yongxiang, a disabled revolutionary soldier from Dongdadi Village, Jiutai County, Jilin Province, went to the village party branch to request work as soon as he returned to his hometown. He said, "Secretary, we were together when we were still naked kids, and we worked for the landlords when we were teenagers; this time we are back to build a new countryside, can the party branch assign me some work?"

    "There is plenty of work in the village, and there is a need for people everywhere, and a need for communists everywhere. Old Zhou, a communist's hands cannot be idle," said party branch secretary Ye Mingzhen.

    Later, Zhou Yongxiang was very happy when he heard that the branch had decided to appoint him as the village's entertainment and health committee member, while also taking care of preferential treatment work. Since then, he has been going to various villages with crutches every day to carry out his work. He always felt that he was not doing enough, especially because he was disabled and could not participate in labor. He believed that if this continued, he would become detached from the masses.

    "Can I be frightened by difficulties? No, no difficulties can stop a communist! I must learn to walk without crutches and participate in labor..."

    Every morning, before the sun showed its face, Zhou Yongxiang went to the river to practice walking.

    One hundred and seventy-five, one hundred and seventy-six... two hundred and one, two hundred and two... He counted the numbers and walked, sweat streaming down Zhou Yongxiang's face, and he continued to practice. High mountains cannot block the way, and difficulties cannot hinder communists. It was precisely the busy farming season in June, and the seedlings in the fields were growing uniformly. Zhou Yongxiang threw away his crutches and walked into the fields with his disabled feet.

    The villagers advised him, some saying: "You have made contributions to the people, you can eat even if you don't work!"

    "That won't do, I'm back to build a new countryside, how can communism come if I don't step up labor?"

    The next day Zhou Yongxiang went to the fields very early again. For eight years, he has persisted in labor with his disabled hands and feet, and is praised by the masses as "the outstanding son and daughter of the party." The Jiutai County Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision, calling on cadres and communists throughout the county to learn from Zhou Yongxiang's noble qualities.

    Red in the Countryside, Specialized in the Countryside

    Miao Shitong, a demobilized soldier of the People's Liberation Army, returned to his hometown in Gansu Province to participate in agricultural production. One day, he went to water wheat with his father. As soon as they finished watering, they encountered a windstorm. The father and son went to the field and saw that the wheat was all lodged on the ground. The father said sadly to him, "It's over! It's over! A year's hard work has been blown away by the wind." At this time, the old man recalled the past and sighed, "When you were nine years old, our family planted three mu of wheat, and it grew very well, but it was lodged by a wind, and we only harvested a little bit, and the family's life was very hard." His father's words touched Miao Shitong's heart, and he said firmly, "We must find a way to prevent the wheat from lodging!" As he spoke, he stood on the edge of the field, carefully looking at the wheat, and pondered the reason for the lodging. Miao Shitong reached out and pulled out a wheat plant. The awns on the wheat culm were smooth and shiny, and the dewdrops on the awns dripped on the back of his hand. He returned to the village to get a scale and a pair of scissors, first cut a wheat ear and weighed it, then cut off the awns and weighed them, and after calculating, he could not help but say to himself, "No wonder it's going to lodge, the awns plus the dew are heavier than the wheat ear, the top is heavy and the bottom is light, and the culm is soft, what else can you expect but lodging!" From that day on, Miao Shitong's mind often pondered a question: "How can we make the white wheat grown in our hometown not grow awns and not lodge?" He often went in and out of the wheat fields, carefully observing the changes in wheat, and talking with old farmers. Before long, he learned that the local Qitou White Wheat had tall culms, large ears, and long awns. If it didn't lodge, the yield would be high, but if it did lodge, the yield would be reduced. The Yupimai wheat promoted from other places had short culms, small ears, and no awns. It was not easy to lodge, but the yield could not keep up with the Qitou White Wheat. Miao Shitong studied the characteristics of the two kinds of wheat and decided to use the hybridization method to improve the wheat varieties. But what exactly is the shape of the pistil and stamen? How to distinguish between pistils and stamens? This series of questions were placed in front of Miao Shitong. In order to learn to identify pistils and stamens, he would pull out the wildflowers when they bloomed to take a look; when the fruit trees bloomed, he would climb onto the branches to see.

    When the wheat was heading, Miao Shitong made the first wheat cross. In order to grasp the time when the wheat bloomed, he watched over the field at noon, even forgetting to eat. At this time, his lung disease had not yet healed. In the hot sun, he squatted in the ridges all day, removing stamens and pollinating. His parents were afraid that their son's condition would worsen, so they prevented him from going to the fields to do experiments. He patiently explained, "If this wheat variety can be improved, how much more grain can be produced in a year!"

    Miao Shitong insisted on studying for seven years of hybridization experiments, and cultivated four excellent wheat varieties that are not prone to lodging, such as Yuqi No. 1, Jiuqi No. 4, Jiuqi No. 8, and Yufangleng Wheat.

    “老八路”在农业生产第一线上
    大别山上的老旗手
    河南新县郭家河的老红军战士郭继保，从部队中转到农业生产战线。十多年来，被评过七十二次模范，被人称为是大别山上的老旗手。他虽然已年过六十，老将不减当年勇，总是带领人们打头阵。
    在一次抗旱中，他每天从早到晚，和青年们一样车水浇地。干旱越来越严重，河枯了，塘也干了，地面上再也找不到可用的水。这时候，还有一百来亩田没有浇灌。支部书记郭继保和社员们正着急的时候，县委发出了大挖山泉的指示。可是，他们这里的年轻人没挖过泉，老年人对挖泉又信心不大。郭继保便去找当年的老赤卫队员说：“老伙计们，现在又该咱们打头阵啦！”老赤卫队员胡明堂说：“好哇！道人山上有古井，那里或许有泉眼。”当夜，他们四个老赤卫队员，扛着镢头，背着干粮，提着灯笼上了道人山。
    这道人山座落在郭家河村西南，山高坡陡，怪石林立。他们顺着山沟，攀着石缝，慢慢向上爬，忽然发现一片青草茂盛、土地湿润的地方。郭继保说：“我记得从前这里溅出过水。我放牛的时候，还在这里饮过牛，咱们先在这里试试。”四个人便动手挖起来。他们挖到一人来深，一股清澈的泉水，忽然冒着水花流了出来。郭继保高兴得没等天明，就跑回去向大家报信，全大队迅速展开了找泉竞赛。郭继保回来对他的三个老伙伴说：“老伙计们，党支部号召每个党员要找三眼泉，咱们老赤卫队员要超额完成任务。”于是，他们在山上住了五天，一共挖了三十二眼泉，还修了一条小渠，使泉水汇成一条溪流，流向干旱的稻田。
    高山挡不住革命战士的去路
    吉林九台县东大地村的革命残废军人周永祥，从部队一回到家乡，就到村里党支部请求工作。他说：“支书，咱们还是光腚娃娃的时候就在一起，十几岁就给地主扛活；这次回来又是为建设新农村来的，支部分配些什么工作给我干干啊？”
      “村子里的工作多着呢，那儿都需要人，那里都需要共产党员。老周，共产党员的手闲不着的。”党支部书记叶明真这样说。
    后来，周永祥听说支部决定叫他担任村的文娱卫生委员，兼顾优抚工作时，高兴极了。从此，他每天拄着双拐到各屯进行工作。他总觉得自己做的还是太少，特别是因为自己是残废，不能参加劳动，他认为这样下去会脱离群众。
    “难道会被困难吓住吗？不能，什么困难也不能挡住共产党员！一定要学会扔掉双拐走路，参加劳动……。”
    每天早晨，太阳没露出脸，周永祥就到河边练习走路。
    一百七十五、一百七十六……二百零一，二百零二……他数着数，走着步，汗水顺着周永祥的脸上流下来，他继续练习着。高山挡不住去路，困难阻碍不了共产党员。正是6月里农忙季节，地里草苗齐长，周永祥扔掉双拐，用残废了的双脚走进田地。
    乡亲们对他一番劝告，有的说：“你为人民立下功劳，不干活也有你吃的呀！”
    “那还行，我是回来建设新农村的，不加紧劳动共产主义能来吗？”
    第二天周永祥又很早就下了地。八年来，他就这样带着残废的手和脚，始终坚持劳动，被群众誉为“党的优秀儿女”。中共九台县委作出决定，号召全县干部和共产党员，学习周永祥的高贵品质。
    红在农村，专在农村
    解放军复员军人苗世统，从部队回到家乡甘肃参加了农业生产，有一天，跟父亲去浇小麦，刚浇完就遭上一场风，爷儿俩到地里一看，满地的麦子都倒伏下去，父亲难过地对他说：“完了！完了！一年的辛苦叫风吹了。”这时老人回忆起过去慨叹地说：“你九岁那年，咱家种了三亩麦子，长得可好，可是遇到一场风，麦子倒伏了，只收下一点点，一家人的生活好苦。”爹的话句句打动了苗世统的心，他坚决地说：“咱一定要想办法，叫麦子不倒伏！”说着便在地埂上，仔细望着麦子，琢磨倒伏的原因。苗世统伸手拔了一株麦子，麦秆子上软溜溜地一闪，麦芒上的露水珠儿便滴落在手背上。他回村去拿来一杆秤和一把剪子，先剪了一个麦穗称了称，又把麦芒剪下来称了称，算了算账，禁不住地自语道：“怪不得要倒伏，麦芒加露水，比麦穗还重，头重脚轻，麦秆又软，不倒有啥说的！”从这天起，苗世统脑子里经常琢磨着一个问题：“怎样叫家乡种的大白麦不长芒，不倒伏？”他经常出入在麦地里，细心观察小麦的变化，跟老农交谈。时间不长，他就了解到：当地播种的齐头白麦，秆高、穗大、芒长，不倒伏产量高，一倒伏就减产，外地推广来的玉皮麦，秆矮、穗小、不长芒，不容易倒伏，但是产量赶不上齐头白麦。苗世统研究了两种小麦的特性，决心用杂交的方法改良小麦品种。但花蕊到底是什么形状？雌蕊雄蕊怎样辨别？这一连串的问题，都摆在苗世统面前，为了学会识别雌蕊雄蕊，野花开花了，他拔下来看看；果树开花了，他爬上枝头瞧瞧。
    麦子扬花了，苗世统第一次作小麦杂交。为了掌握小麦开花的时间，他中午看守在地头，连饭也顾不得吃。这时节，他的肺病还没有好。在火热的太阳底下，他整天蹲在地垅里，取蕊、授粉。他父亲母亲生怕儿子病情加重，便阻挡他下地作试验。他耐心地解释说：“要能把这小麦品种改良好了，一年要多增产多少粮食啊！”
    苗世统坚持研究了七年的杂交试验，培育出了玉齐一号、九齐四号、九齐八号和玉方楞麦等四种不容易倒伏的优良小麦品种。
