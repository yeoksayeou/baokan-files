Fertile Land, Leaping Decade
　　中共思茅地委通讯组
　　Xishuangbanna, like a green jewel, shines on the border of Yunnan, our motherland. Magnificent mountains are covered with primitive and dense forests, with green pines and bamboos, and a hundred flowers blooming, forming a beautiful natural picture. Surrounded by mountains, there are vast plains, the land is fertile, and the fields are connected. Deep in the banana, coconut, palm, and purple bamboo forests, the villages of various ethnic groups are shaded.
　　On this beautiful and fertile land live 320,000 hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups, mainly Dai, and also Hani, Bulang, Lahu, Yao, Miao, Hui, Han, Kawa, and Jingpo and more than ten other ethnic groups.
　　Xishuangbanna is located in the tropical and subtropical zones, with a total area of more than 25,000 square kilometers, bordering Myanmar and Laos to the southwest. Scientists describe the climate here as: "Having the advantages of an oceanic climate, without the disadvantages of an oceanic climate, and having the advantages of a continental climate, without the disadvantages of a continental climate." The annual rainfall is about 1,400 millimeters, and the average temperature is above 18 degrees Celsius. Most areas are frost-free all year round. Due to the warm climate, the plains are very suitable for planting double-season rice, and cotton can be sown in spring and winter. It is rich in a wide variety of tropical and subtropical cash crops. The more valuable ones include Rauvolfia, which can cure hypertension, Cinchona, which makes quinine, sisal hemp, which has high-grade fiber, oil dregs and oil palm, which have the highest oil content, and fragrant roots, geraniums and fragrant grasses that extract spices, as well as coconuts, bananas, pineapples, mangoes and other tropical fruits, which are available all year round, and exotic flowers and plants bloom all year round, forming a natural "botanical garden" of colorful flowers.
　　In areas above 1,000 meters above sea level, a large amount of tea is produced. There are more than 50 tea mountains in the state, and tea trees are mixed with camphor trees to form forests. The famous "Pu'er tea" is produced here. The primitive forests on the mountains breed rare wild elephant groups, as well as rhinos, wild cattle, flying dragons, flying tigers, peacocks, swans, hornbills and many other exotic birds and animals. This is also a natural "zoo".
　　However, before liberation, this lovely place in Xishuangbanna was called the "area of miasma," and people were a little "scared" when they mentioned Xishuangbanna. Miasma is actually malaria. Due to the cruel exploitation of the ruling classes of the past dynasties, the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna were extremely poor, and various diseases were prevalent, especially malignant malaria, which caused a large number of deaths. The ruling class created the smoke screen of the so-called "area of miasma" in order to cover up its crimes.
　　In February 1950, the five-star red flag was raised in the blue sky of Xishuangbanna. Since then, the Party has led the 320,000 people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna to gradually move towards socialism in accordance with the characteristics of the ethnic groups and class relations in the border areas. In the early days of liberation, the historical ethnic divisions were relatively deep, and there were still remnants of enemies carrying out sabotage. After analyzing the situation at that time, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the principle of "prudence and steadiness" determined by the Party Central Committee in its work with ethnic minorities in the border areas, vigorously carried out economic, cultural, educational, and health work with production as the center, straightened out ethnic relations, relied on the masses, eliminated bandits and special agents, and cultivated a large number of local ethnic minority cadres in various tasks.
　　With the enhancement of ethnic unity, the improvement of the awareness of the masses of all ethnic groups, and the large-scale growth of ethnic minority cadres, in order to enable the people of all ethnic groups to exercise their right to be masters of their own affairs and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, the Party officially established the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in January 1953. After the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy, the working people of all ethnic groups urgently demanded the abolition of the feudal lord system and the rapid construction of socialism. In accordance with the demands of the people, the Party analyzed the socio-economic development level and the very uneven development characteristics of the ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna, and decided to adopt different forms and policies to implement democratic reforms. Then, in accordance with the demands of the peasants, the Party led the peasants of all ethnic groups to start organizing mutual aid teams in 1956, and on the basis of mutual aid teams, trial cooperatives were established. At that time, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for only 7% of the total number of peasant households. After the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the cooperatives developed to account for 90% of the total number of peasant households, and collectivization was basically realized in the whole state, and people's communes were established in some areas.
　　After the realization of democratic reform and socialist transformation, Xishuangbanna unprecedentedly strengthened the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and greatly liberated the productive forces. In addition, the state has issued a large amount of agricultural production funds, various relief funds, and tea investment funds over the past ten years, and has also established 19 state-owned farms in the border areas as demonstrations, providing the best conditions for the people of all ethnic groups to develop production. In particular, since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the speed of development has been even faster. In this year alone, more than 6,000 large and small water conservancy projects were completed, and half of the rice fields in the state have been basically irrigated, and the cultivated land area has been expanded by 300,000 mu compared with before liberation. The people of all ethnic groups have also used the superior natural conditions here to reform the farming system, changing rice, corn, potatoes, peanuts, soybeans, cotton and other crops from one crop a year to two crops. This year, the double-season rice in the state has developed to 65,000 mu. In terms of cultivation technology, "slash-and-burn cultivation" has been changed to intensive cultivation; no fertilization has been changed to fertilization; plowing the land only when planting seedlings has been changed to winter plowing and sun exposure; and planting without management has been changed to persisting in weeding, pest control, and topdressing; at the same time, various new agricultural tools and improved varieties have been promoted. Therefore, the output of food and cash crops in the state has increased rapidly. Animal husbandry and sideline occupations have also made an all-round leap forward, and the total output value of agricultural and sideline occupations in the state has increased by two times in ten years.
　　While vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the state's industry, commerce, transportation, and cultural and health undertakings have also developed by leaps and bounds. Before liberation, Xishuangbanna was a blank sheet of paper in industry. Now, a number of local state-owned factories and mines have been established in the state. Before liberation, there were no highways in Xishuangbanna. It took a month to walk from Kunming to here. Now it only takes three or four days by car. More than 1,000 kilometers of highways have been built in the state, running through the main towns in the territory. With the construction of highways, a large number of industrial products from the mainland have been transported to the border areas, and the tea and other local specialties here have also been transported to all parts of the country. Some ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna were still in the era of recording events by carving wood and tying ropes before liberation. Now they have created their own writing. Among the young and middle-aged Dai people, 70% have been lifted out of illiteracy. The state has established five secondary schools and vocational schools and 250 primary schools, with more than 20,000 students, of whom 80% are ethnic minority students. The state has also established many scientific research institutions in the border areas and cultivated a large number of scientific talents from ethnic minorities.
　　Due to the development of production, the improvement of people's living standards, and the development of health care, the malignant malaria that once prevailed in history has been basically controlled. For example, in Menghai Dam, where malaria was highly prevalent in the past, the incidence of malaria has dropped from 50% to 0.038%. The smoke screen of the so-called "area of miasma" has been completely dispelled, and a new atmosphere of prosperity and national prosperity has emerged in the state. The poverty and backwardness of the past have disappeared like the Lancang River, and the green jewel state has become more beautiful and attractive under the hard work of the people of all ethnic groups!
　　The brilliant achievements made by the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the past ten years are a great victory for the ethnic policy formulated in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for the three red flags of the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune in the border areas. As a Dai poet sang in a song:
　　Our laughter and happiness,
　　Are not gifts from gods and ghosts,
　　Nor the coming of a Living Buddha.
　　Only because our Xishuangbanna,
　　On one day in February 1950,
　　A new sun appeared.
　　The sun is Mao Zedong,
　　The sun is the Communist Party.

    富饶的土地  飞跃的十年
    中共思茅地委通讯组
    西双版纳，像一颗绿色宝珠，闪耀在祖国的云南边疆。雄伟的群山，披复着原始茂密的森林，苍松翠竹，百花竞开，构成美丽的自然图画。丛山环绕中，是一片一片广阔的平坝，土地肥沃，田连阡陌，在香蕉林、椰子林、棕榈林和紫竹林的深处，荫蔽着各个民族的村落。
    在这块美丽富饶的土地上，居住着三十二万勤劳勇敢的各族人民，以傣族为主，并有哈尼、布朗、拉祜、瑶、苗、回、汉、佧佤和景颇等十多种民族。
    西双版纳地处热带、亚热带，全州面积二万五千多平方公里，西南面与缅甸和老挝相连。科学家们形容这里的气候是：“具有海洋性气候的优点，无海洋性气候的缺点，有大陆性气候的优点，无大陆性气候的缺点。”每年降雨量在一千四百毫米左右，平均温度在摄氏十八度以上，大部地区终年无霜。由于气候温暖，坝区里很适于栽双季稻谷，棉花春冬都可播种，这里盛产种类繁多的热带和亚热带经济作物，比较名贵的有可治高血压症的萝芙木，制奎宁的金鸡纳树，有高级纤维的剑麻，有含油量最高的植物油渣果和油棕，提取香料的香根、天竺葵和满山遍野的芳香草，至于椰子、香蕉、菠萝、芒果等热带水果，更是四季不断，奇花异草终年盛开，构成一座万紫千红的天然“植物园”。
    在拔海一千米以上的地区，大量产茶，全州有茶山五十余处，茶树与樟脑树混合成林，中外驰名的“普洱茶”就出产在这里。山上的原始森林，繁殖着目前世界上稀有的野象群，以及犀牛、野牛、飞龙、飞虎、孔雀、天鹅、犀鸟等许多奇禽异兽。这里也是一个天然的“动物园”。
    可是，在解放以前，西双版纳这块可爱的地方却被人称为“瘴气之区”，人们一提到西双版纳，就有点“谈虎色变”。瘴气，实际是疟疾。由于历代统治阶级的残酷剥削，使西双版纳各族人民极端贫困，各种疾病流行，特别是恶性疟疾，造成人民大量死亡。统治阶级为了掩饰其罪恶，制造出所谓“瘴气之区”的烟幕。
    1950年2月，在西双版纳蔚蓝色的天空，升起了五星红旗。从这时起，党就根据边疆各民族和阶级关系的特点，领导西双版纳三十二万各族人民，逐步走向社会主义。在解放初期，历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂比较深，还有残余敌人进行破坏。中共云南省委分析了当时的情况后，根据党中央确定的在边疆民族工作中必须“慎重稳进”的方针，大力开展了以生产为中心的经济、文教、卫生各项工作，疏通民族关系，依靠群众，肃清匪特，并在各项工作中培养出了大批本地民族干部。
    随着民族团结的增强、各族群众觉悟的提高以及民族干部的大量成长，党为了使各族人民行使当家作主的权利，巩固人民民主专政，于1953年1月正式成立了西双版纳傣族自治州。在民族区域自治实施以后，各族劳动人民又迫切要求废除封建领主制度，迅速建设社会主义。党根据人民的要求，分析了西双版纳地区各民族的社会经济发展水平和发展很不平衡的特点，决定采取不同的形式和政策，实行了民主改革。接着，党又根据农民的要求，领导各族农民在1956年开始组织互助组，在互助组的基础上，试办了合作社，当时入社农户只占总农户的7％，经过1958年的大跃进，合作社发展到占总农户的90％，在全州基本上实现了合作化，并有个别地区成立了人民公社。
    西双版纳在实现了民主改革和社会主义改造以后，空前地加强了各族人民的团结，大大解放了生产力。加以国家十年来发放了大量的农业生产费、各种救济款和茶叶投资款，同时在边疆兴办了十九个国营农场，作为示范，为各族人民发展生产提供了最良好的条件。特别是1958年大跃进以来，发展的速度更快。这一年就修成大小水利工程六千余处，全州稻田有一半已基本水利化，耕地面积比解放前扩大了三十万亩。各族人民又利用这里优厚的自然条件，改革耕作制度，把水稻、玉米、薯类、花生、大豆、棉花等作物由一年一熟改为两熟，到今年全州双季稻已发展到六万五千亩。在耕作技术上，改“刀耕火种”为精耕细作；改不施肥为施肥；改栽秧才犁田为冬耕晒垡；改只栽不管为坚持除草、防虫、追肥；同时推广了各种新式农具和良种。因此，全州的粮食和经济作物产量都迅速上升。畜牧业和副业也全面跃进，全州的农副业总产值在十年内增长了两倍。
    在大办农业、大办粮食的同时，全州工业、商业、交通运输和文教卫生事业相应地有了飞跃发展。解放前西双版纳在工业上是一张白纸，现在全州已建立了一批地方国营厂矿。解放前西双版纳没有公路，从昆明到这里要走一个月，现在坐汽车只需三、四天可达，全州已修建公路一千多公里，贯穿境内的主要城镇。随着公路的修通，祖国内地的工业品大量运到边疆，这里的茶叶和其它土特产品也运到全国各地。西双版纳有的民族在解放前还处于刻木结绳记事的时代，现在已创立了自己的文字。在傣族的青壮年中，已有70％脱离了文盲状态。全州已设立五所中等学校和专业学校以及二百五十所小学，学生二万余人，其中少数民族学生占80％。国家还在边疆举办了不少科学研究机构，大量培养少数民族的科学人材。
    由于生产的发展，人民生活的改善和保健事业的发展、历史上曾经猖獗流行的恶性疟疾已基本被制止，如过去疟疾高度流行的勐海坝，疟疾发病率已由50％降低到0.038％。所谓“瘴气之区”的烟幕已被完全驱散，全州出现了人丁兴旺、民族繁荣的新气象。过去那种贫困和落后的面貌，已像澜沧江水，一去不返，绿色的宝州在各族人民的辛勤耕耘下，变得更加美丽、更加引人入胜了！
    十年来，西双版纳傣族自治州所取得的光辉成就，是根据毛泽东思想制订的民族政策的伟大胜利，是党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗在边疆的伟大胜利。正如一位傣族诗人在一首歌中所唱的：
  我们的欢笑与幸福，
    不是神鬼的恩赐，
    不是活佛降临。
    只因为我们的西双版纳，
    在1950年2月的一天，
    出现了新的太阳。
    太阳是毛泽东，
    太阳是共产党。
