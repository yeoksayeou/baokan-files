    The Method of Helping
    Wu Lü
    The advanced help the less advanced. But there are some subtleties in how to help.

    Organizing advanced experience promotion teams is one way to help; holding technical demonstrations is also a way to help; today's *People's Daily* article on the Kailuan Coal Mine's Zhaogezhuang Mine organizing advanced pacesetters to help backward groups introduces another way to help. In this mine, 1,200 advanced pacesetters helped backward groups on a large scale, and in just over a month, 60% of the backward groups caught up with the advanced. The speed and breadth of this flowering prove that this method of helping is very effective.

    The advanced pacesetters going to the backward groups to help embodies the dialectical materialist view that external causes work through internal causes.

    The emergence of advanced pacesetters sets an example for the backward; the promotion of advanced experience opens up a path for the backward to catch up with the advanced. However, for the backward to develop towards the advanced, these are only external causes, merely creating favorable conditions for the backward to develop into the advanced. Whether the backward can develop into the advanced, and when they will become advanced, mainly depends on internal causes, on whether the backward have used these favorable conditions to solve the ideological, organizational, and technical problems that caused them to fall behind. If these problems are not solved, then no matter how many advanced pacesetters there are, like forests and seas, no matter how colorful the advanced experiences are, the backward will still be backward and will not automatically transform into the advanced.

    This point is very important. Understanding this point allows us to understand how to help. Helping means applying external causes to internal causes. The best method of helping is to delve into the backward units and use advanced external causes to promote changes in the internal causes of the backward that are conducive to developing towards the advanced. If we do not understand the reasons why the backward are lagging behind, and do not exert the role of external causes through changes in internal causes, it will be difficult to achieve the desired effect of helping. Why is it that some units have also established pacesetters, planted red flags, and introduced many advanced experiences, but still do not see many backward units catching up and becoming advanced? One important reason is that the leadership only focused on the advanced, set examples for the backward, and introduced experiences, creating external favorable conditions for the backward to catch up with the advanced, but did not simultaneously focus on the backward, study the internal causes of the backward, and promote changes in internal causes. The benefit of the Zhaogezhuang Mine's method of organizing advanced pacesetters to help backward groups lies in the fact that it is not simply calling on advanced pacesetters to help the backward, not just giving a hand from the outside, talking about experience, or doing a few performances and then being done with it; but rather, it allows advanced pacesetters to live in backward units, become one with the workers of the backward units, and make close friends. First, do a good job of ideological work, and then work with everyone to find the key to production, analyze the reasons, and formulate measures. In this way, the role of the internal causes of the backward units is stimulated, and the backward are helped to catch up with the advanced through changes in internal causes.

    帮的方法
    吴滤
    先进帮后进。怎样帮，很有些讲究。
    组织先进经验推广队，是一种帮的方法；举行技术表演，也是一种帮的方法；今天本报发表的开滦煤矿赵各庄矿组织先进标兵到后进小组帮助后进的新闻，又介绍了另一种帮的方法。这个矿的一千二百名先进标兵到后进小组大帮后进，只一个多月的时间，全矿60％的后进组就赶上了先进，开花之快，结果之广，证明了这种帮的方法是很有效果的。
    先进标兵到后进小组去帮助后进，这种帮的方法，体现了外因通过内因起作用的辩证唯物观点。
    先进标兵的出现，为后进的树立了榜样；先进经验的推广，为后进的开辟了赶上先进的道路；但是，对于后进朝先进发展说来，这些都只是外因，只是为后进发展为先进创造了有利的条件。后进的能不能发展为先进，什么时候成为先进，主要的还决定于内因，决定于后进的是不是利用了这些有利条件，解决了所以造成后进的思想上的、组织上的、技术上的种种问题。如果没有解决这些问题，那么，尽管先进标兵如林似海，尽管先进经验万紫千红，后进的还是后进，并不会因此就自动转化为先进。
    这一点，很重要。明白了这一点，才懂得应该怎样去帮。帮，就是把外因作用于内因。帮的方法，最上乘的，就是深入到后进单位，用先进的外因促进后进的内因发生有利于朝先进发展的变化。如果并不了解后进落在后面的原因，不是通过内因的变化来发挥外因的作用，就很难收到帮的效果。为什么有的单位也树了标兵，插了红旗，介绍了许多先进经验，仍不见有许多后进的赶上来变成先进呢？重要原因之一，就是领导上只抓了先进，为后进的树了榜样，介绍了经验，创造了后进赶上先进的外在的有利条件，而没有同时去抓后进，研究后进的内因，促进内因的变化。赵各庄矿组织先进标兵到后进小组去帮助后进，这种方法的好处，就在于它不是一般地号召先进标兵帮助后进，不是从外部帮一手，谈一谈经验，做几次表演就算完了的；而是让先进标兵生活在后进单位，同后进单位的工人打成一片，交知心朋友。首先作好思想工作，然后同大家一起找生产上的关键，分析原因，制定措施，这样，就激发了后进单位的内因的作用，通过内因的变化来帮助后进赶上先进。
