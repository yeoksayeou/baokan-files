The Greatest Happiness and Joy
Zhu Yuqi, Captain of the Rocket Youth Shock Brigade, Wangjiaqiao Production Team, Zhangqiao Commune, Pudong County, Shanghai

In 1958 and 1960, I went to Beijing twice to attend the National Congress of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction and the National Militia Congress. On both occasions, I met our beloved leader Chairman Mao and the central leaders. Chairman Mao also had cordial talks with us and took pictures with us. The leader's teachings gave me immense encouragement and strength, and I deeply felt how glorious and happy it is to be a farmer in New China. Therefore, I am even more determined to love the countryside and agricultural labor. Because this is the glorious task assigned to us youth by the Party and Chairman Mao, I am determined to devote my life to building rural people's communes.

Our country is "poor and blank," and rural life and agricultural labor are still relatively hard, but compared to the painful lives of exploitation and oppression suffered by us poor and lower-middle peasants before liberation, we are enjoying great blessings. Of course, to live a truly happy and prosperous life, we must be determined to work hard and do a good job in agricultural production. Once, a relative wanted to introduce me to a factory, and I said that agricultural production needs me, and field production is very tight. How can I leave agricultural production to go to the factory based on my own interests? So, I insisted on staying on the front line of agricultural production.

In production, we have encountered many difficulties. In our shock brigade's 35 mu of high-yield cotton fields, four mu were piles of sand and gravel, overgrown with weeds, and no crops had been planted for decades. This spring, we proposed that the land is dead, but people are alive. It is not heroic to win high yields on good land; it is heroic to win high yields on wasteland. The team members were very enthusiastic after hearing this, and immediately devoted themselves to transforming this land, moving bricks, digging stones, leveling the land, and applying base fertilizer. After a hard battle, this land changed its appearance, and transplanted cotton was planted, growing strong and luxuriant, with white flowers all over the plants. Every time the team members passed the field, they happily said, "We really brought the dead land back to life, crops grew on stones, and cotton grew on brick land." At this time, we felt the greatest happiness and joy after hard work.

I am young, have a low level of education, and lack production experience and agricultural scientific knowledge. But I often think that the land is dead, and the thousands of catties of grain and cotton are all planted by people. We must master the laws of high yield so that all the land can be cultivated. I don't understand a lot of things, so I often think, often ask, learn from old farmers, and learn from technicians, and I write down what I have learned. I also often summarize the experiences and lessons of my high-yield fields. I think that young people are physically strong and have soaring enthusiasm, coupled with rich production knowledge and experience, then we will certainly be able to make greater contributions to running agriculture in a big way.

    最大的幸福和乐趣
    上海市浦东县张桥公社王家桥生产队火箭青年突击队队长　朱玉琪
    1958年和1960年我先后两次去北京，出席了全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议和全国民兵代表大会。两次见到了敬爱的领袖毛主席和中央各位首长。主席还和我们作了亲切谈话，并且一起拍了照片。领袖的教导给了我无比巨大的鼓舞和力量，深深感到作一个新中国的农民，是多么光荣和幸福。于是，我更坚决地热爱农村和农业劳动。因为这是党和毛主席交给我们青年的光荣任务，我立志要为建设农村人民公社大搞一辈子。
    我国是“一穷二白”的国家，农村的生活和农业劳动现在还比较苦，可是比起解放前我们贫雇农那种被剥削被压迫的痛苦生活来，是享了大福了。当然要过上真正幸福富裕的生活还必须下定决心埋头苦干，把农业生产搞好。有一次一个亲戚要介绍我进工厂，我说农业生产需要我，田里生产很紧张，我怎么可以凭自己兴趣，离开农业生产到工厂去呢？就这样，我坚持在农业生产第一线。
    在生产中，我们曾经遇到过不少困难。在我们突击队的三十五亩棉花丰产田里，有四亩是砂石成堆，杂草丛生的地，几十年也没有人种过庄稼。今年春天，我们提出地是死的，人是活的，好田夺高产，不算英雄；荒地上夺高产，才算好汉。队员们听了这话情绪高涨，立即投入了改造这块地的战斗，搬砖头，挖石头，平土地，上基肥，一场苦战，这块地变样了，种上了移植棉，长得健壮茂密，白花满株。队员每次走过田头，都开心地说：“我们真的把死地种活了，石头上长出了庄稼，砖地上生出棉花了。”这时我们就感到了艰苦劳动后的最大的幸福和乐趣。
    我年轻，文化低，生产经验和农业科学知识很差。但我常想，田是死的，千斤粮，千斤棉都是人种出来的。我们一定要掌握住高产的规律，使所有的田都能种植。而自己不懂的东西很多，于是我就经常想，经常问，向老农民学，向技术员学，学到了一点就记下来。我也常常总结自己丰产田里的经验教训。我想，青年人体力健壮，又有冲天的干劲，再加上有丰富的生产知识和经验，那我们一定能为大办农业作出更大的贡献。
