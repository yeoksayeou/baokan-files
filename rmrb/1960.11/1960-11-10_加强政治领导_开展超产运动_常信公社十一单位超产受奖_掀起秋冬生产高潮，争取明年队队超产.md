Strengthen Political Leadership, Launch an Overproduction Campaign
Changxin Commune Awards Eleven Units for Overproduction
Sparking an Autumn and Winter Production Upsurge, Striving for Overproduction in Every Team Next Year

(Our report) Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region—The Changxin Commune in Helan County recently held an "Overproduction Award" conference, awarding bonuses to eleven units that exceeded their summer crop quotas, thereby sparking an upsurge in autumn and winter production.

This summer, the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system in Changxin Commune was implemented based on a thorough verification of yields. Among the 55 contracted units in the commune, 30 exceeded their production quotas, with 11 units exceeding production by more than 5%, receiving rewards totaling 2,753 yuan in cash, in addition to some grain. According to regulations, 20% was turned over to the brigade, and 80% was retained by the team. The team then distributed 60% of all cash and grain rewards to the members, fully embodying the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work.

This year, the Commune Party Committee held four or five meetings to review the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system in the past and conduct repeated discussions. On the basis of raising ideological understanding, the members were mobilized to recalculate last year's "Three Guarantees and One Reward" contracts, and 17 overproducing units were rewarded. Subsequently, the Commune Party Committee adopted a series of measures: First, it adhered to the principle of putting politics in command, with Party organizations at all levels from the commune to the production team conscientiously grasping the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system; second, it ensured that contracted units had sufficient labor and strengthened crop management to achieve overproduction. To ensure that the "Three Guarantees" targets were implemented, the Commune Party Committee organized cadres at the commune, brigade, and team levels, as well as members, to participate in a general review of the implementation of the "Three Guarantees" in April this year, and promptly corrected individual instances of excessively high or low production targets. On the basis of implementing the production targets, contracts were signed, and the secretary of the Commune Party Committee also signed and sealed the contracts to supervise their implementation.

After the "Three Guarantees" were implemented, everyone shouldered the heavy burden together, and the members' enthusiasm for production was greatly enhanced, and the sense of responsibility was greatly strengthened, and the overproduction movement surged. When the Hongxi Third Production Team was formulating this year's wheat yield increase targets, it did not analyze the land plot by plot or formulate separate targets. The members immediately raised objections. The Party branch accepted this suggestion and organized the members to formulate yield increase measures for each of the team's 330 mu of wheat land, carrying out different processing. The Xinmin Second Production Team, which had been overproducing and receiving awards for years, originally planned to apply only 200 jin of indigenous fertilizer per mu in the wheat yield increase measures, but after the wheat broke ground, the first inspection revealed that 97 mu were third-class seedlings. The members suggested that third-class seedlings should not be allowed to pass the second irrigation, and they proactively applied 500 jin of indigenous fertilizer per mu to the third-class seedling fields. After the second irrigation, all the third-class seedlings were upgraded, and some even jumped to first-class.

This overproduction reward conference greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members for production and set off a new upsurge in autumn and winter production. The members are determined to do a good job in all preparations for next year's spring plowing and strive for overproduction again next year. In order to strengthen leadership, 31 of the commune's cadres, except for 12 who remained, were all transferred to lower levels; 45% of the brigade cadres were transferred to lower levels to participate in production. The commune's enterprises and institutions saved more than half of their personnel to supplement the front line of agricultural production. Currently, all members are concentrating their efforts on winter production, striving for overproduction in every team next year.

    加强政治领导　开展超产运动
    常信公社十一单位超产受奖
    掀起秋冬生产高潮，争取明年队队超产
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区贺兰县常信公社最近召开了“超产奖励”大会，对夏田超包产的十一个单位颁发了奖金，从而掀起了秋冬季生产高潮。
    常信公社今年夏季的“三包一奖”的执行是在反复核实产量的基础上进行的。全社五十五个承包单位中，有三十个超了产，其中十一个单位超产在5％以上，受到了奖励，除部分粮食外，共得到现金二千七百五十三元。按规定除把20％上缴大队外，80％归小队所有；小队又从全部所得奖金和粮食中，抽出60％分给社员，充分体现了按劳分配、多劳多得的原则。
    今年，公社党委先后召开了四、五次会议，对过去执行“三包一奖”制的情况作了检查，进行了反复讨论。在提高思想认识的基础上，发动社员追算了去年的“三包一奖”合同，奖励了十七个超产单位。接着公社党委又采取了一系列的措施：首先坚持政治挂帅，从公社到生产小队各级党组织认真抓“三包一奖”制度；其次，保证包产单位有足够劳力，加强作物的管理，实现超产。为了使“三包”指标落实，公社党委在今年4月间又组织公社、大队、小队三级干部和社员参加，普遍进行了“三包”落实复查，及时纠正了个别包产指标偏高偏低现象。在包产指标落实的基础上，签订了合同，公社党委书记也在合同中签名盖章，监督执行。
    “三包”落实以后，千斤担子众人担，社员的生产积极性极为高涨，责任心大为加强，超包产运动风起云涌。洪西第三生产队在制定今年小麦增产指标时，对土地没有逐块分析，分别制订指标，社员马上提出了意见。党支部接受了这一意见，组织社员把全队三百三十亩小麦田都逐块制订了增产措施，进行了不同的加工。连年超产受奖的新民第二生产队，在小麦增产措施中，原计划每亩只追土化肥二百斤，但当小麦破土出苗后，经过第一次排队，有九十七亩三类苗。社员们纷纷提出，不让三类苗混过二水关，他们主动地在三类苗田里每亩追了五百斤土化肥。二水过后，三类苗全部升了级，有些并跃升到一类。
    通过这次超产奖励大会，大大鼓舞了广大社员的生产积极性，掀起了秋冬生产新高潮。社员们决心作好明年春耕生产的一切准备工作，力争明年再超产。为了加强领导，公社的三十一名干部中，除留十二名外，其余全部下放；大队干部45％下放参加生产。公社企业、事业单位节省出一半以上的人员，充实了农业生产第一线。目前，全体社员正在集中精力大搞冬季生产，争取明年队队超产。
