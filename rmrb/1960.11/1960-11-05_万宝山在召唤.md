    Wanbao Mountain is Calling
    Lü Jiang
    Jinggang Mountain! You are not only a glorious revolutionary mountain, but also a rich and beautiful treasure mountain!
    Look! The mountains are covered with dense forests and bamboos. The trees include precious sandalwood, camphor, eucalyptus, and oak, all in various shapes and forms. Most abundant are pines and firs, all growing tall and beautiful, exceptionally high, as if trying to pierce the clouds. The bamboos include rare and famous species such as square bamboo, black bamboo, Buddha's belly bamboo, Guanyin bamboo, and solid bamboo; the most common is thatch bamboo, thick and sturdy. These are all excellent materials for building houses, scaffolding, and making furniture and musical instruments. There are also abundant wild fruit forests and economic forests such as waxberry, peach, pear, litsea cubeba, oil-tea camellia, and acorn, laden with fruit, which can be used for winemaking and oil extraction. The mountains are covered with cogon grass, nodding vigorously to passersby in the mountain breeze, a good raw material for papermaking. The ground is covered with green grass, interspersed with precious Chinese medicinal herbs such as Coptis chinensis, Magnolia officinalis, and Ligusticum chuanxiong. There is also a type of tea called "Gou Gu Nao," with a refreshing fragrance, which still tastes strong even after six or seven infusions. ... Throughout the four seasons, the mountains are a uniform dark green, occasionally inlaid with colors of red, white, yellow, and purple, stretching endlessly for dozens or hundreds of miles.
    Welcoming the refreshing mountain breeze, bathing in the fresh fragrance of flowers, and walking through the misty mountains in a sea of trees, suddenly there is a rustle overhead, and a quail flies past. Behind you, there is another swish, and a deer runs away. These deep mountains and dense forests hide many swans, eagles, wild boars, wild cattle, rabbits, tigers, leopards, muntjacs, monkeys, and other birds and beasts for hunting! In the babbling streams, sometimes an unusual fish swims by, with four legs and a unique shape, which also makes a sound like a baby crying. The local people call it "dog fish," and it tastes fresh and delicious. There is a true story about it in the mountainous areas: In the old days, the locals caught two of them and specially sent them to Chairman Mao to taste. Because it grows fat by eating small fish and shrimp, Chairman Mao used it as an analogy, saying that it was a bully among fish, just like the local tyrants and evil gentry among humans, and that they should all be eliminated! The locals were greatly inspired and encouraged, and said in unison: "Dog fish must be eaten, and local tyrants and evil gentry must be overthrown!"...
    On Jinggang Mountain, everything you see and touch is treasure and wealth! They have been dormant for thousands of years, growing and dying on their own; it was not until recently that they were gradually awakened and sent to various places needed for the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Why wasn't it developed earlier? If you follow the narrow paths that Chairman Mao and the Red Army once walked (every inch of this path is left with their footprints and sweat!), crossing mountains and ridges, you will find the answer: Jinggang Mountain has overlapping peaks, high mountains and dangerous roads, closed transportation, and few people. Developing it and transporting resources out is not a simple matter. Moreover, at that time, our revolutionary regime had just been established, and there were frequent battles. Where was the strength to march towards nature?
    In the winter of 1957, more than 700 transferred cadres, demobilized soldiers, and Shanghai youth came to Jinggang Mountain, and together with the local old revolutionaries and locals, made a grand wish and oath: "Be red in Jinggang Mountain, be specialized in Jinggang Mountain, and build Jinggang Mountain for a lifetime; develop Jinggang Mountain and support the country's various constructions!" Since then, Jinggang Mountain has been rumbling day and night, clanging, plus the sound of work chants and songs, forming a magnificent symphony of mountain construction. The face of Jinggang Mountain has changed greatly, and it has become even more prosperous and beautiful in the hands of the second generation of revolutionaries.
    Roads have been built. What kind of roads are these! Just to say from the center of the Jinggang Mountain area—Ciping to Longshi, where Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu met in those days, the road is fifty kilometers long, crossing Huangyangjie, one of the five major natural barriers, with winding and circuitous turns, and nine folds back and forth. An engineer who had worked on the Kangzang Highway said that the difficulty of the Huangyangjie Highway is not necessarily better than the Kangzang Highway. Four such roads have already been built, and plans for the fifth, sixth, and seventh... are gradually taking shape in the minds of the Jinggang Mountain builders. Beside the road, the remains of the narrow paths of the past are still there. From the rugged and steep paths to the flat and wide roads, people can imagine how difficult and arduous the road that our Chinese revolution once traveled was, and how the great leader Chairman Mao carried hundreds of pounds of grain on his shoulders... No, carrying the heavy burden of the Chinese revolution on his shoulders, he traveled over mountains and ridges on the arduous path. Now, the revolution has finally won and embarked on a broad road. The roads have transported the rich resources of Wanbao Mountain in large quantities to the construction of Inner Mongolia, Harbin, and Shanghai, and also transported large quantities of materials from all over the country that are not available here to the mountains.
    Hydropower stations have also been built. They were built using the rushing streams of Tongmu Ridge. People raced against time in one winter, finally catching up with the arrival of the flood, so that the power station began to supply electricity during the tenth anniversary of the National Day. This hydropower station has basically electrified the towns, villages, and factories within dozens of miles around. At night, at the touch of a button, Ciping, Baiyin Lake, Shishikou, Da Xiaowujing, were suddenly as bright as day, like thousands of bright pearls, dotted on the mountains and under the mountains, Jinggang Mountain has become a mountain area that never sleeps.
    At the same time as the construction of roads and power stations, more than 20 machinery factories, chemical factories, fiberboard factories, wineries, perfume factories, and bamboo carving art factories have been completed and put into production, the scale is small and medium-sized, and the method is a combination of local and foreign methods. What is particularly worth mentioning is the result of comprehensive utilization, which amazes people at the wisdom of the Jinggang Mountain people. For example, the comprehensive utilization of pine trees can produce dozens of products such as rosin, resin, pine soot, pine tar, turpentine, pine needle oil, pine root oil, and pine root kerosene. Every plant and tree on Jinggang Mountain, in the eyes of the Jinggang Mountain people, has its use, and every one of them is priceless treasure.
    The Jinggang Mountain people also built terraces from the foot of the mountain to the top in the mountainous areas with high mountains, cold water, strong winds, and heavy fog. They want these terraces to yield abundant grain that is more than enough for their own consumption. Now, the trial planting of double-cropping rice has been successful, and the highest yield per mu has reached a thousand catties. The grain in the mountainous area is already more than self-sufficient.
    Jinggang Mountain, Wanbao Mountain! You have contributed so much to the revolution in the past and now for construction! The revolutionary people grow in your arms generation after generation, and in turn promote you to emit more heat and light. Now, you are calling again, calling people to quickly develop your inexhaustible treasures, so that you can contribute more and more to the revolution and the socialist construction cause of the motherland. Revolutionary sons and daughters are rushing from all directions, from Nanchang, from the entire Jiangxi Province, from many cities and villages across the country, to your side, following the path that Chairman Mao and the old Red Army walked, working day and night, to make your treasures contribute more, and make your face change faster and better!

    万宝山在召唤
    吕江
    井冈山啊！你不仅是一座光荣的革命山，而且是一座富饶、美丽的万宝山！
    看！漫山遍野，密密层层地布满茂林修竹。林木有珍贵的檀、樟、桉、栎，多姿多态；最多的是松杉，都长得挺拔秀丽，又高得出奇，似乎一根根都要戳破云霄。竹子有方竹、黑竹、罗汉竹、观音竹、实心竹等稀罕的名竹；最普遍的是茅竹，粗壮结实。这全是建筑房屋用的栋梁、脚手架以及制作家具、乐器的好材料；也还有杨梅、桃、梨、山苍子、油茶子、橡子等丰富的野生果林和经济林，果实累累，可以酿酒、熬油。满山的芭茅草，顺着山风一个劲向行人点头，那是造纸的好原料。遍地的青草，里头夹着黄连、原朴、川芎等名贵的中药材；还有一种茶叶，名叫“狗古脑”，清香扑鼻，泡到六七次，味道仍浓。……一年四季，山上黛绿一色，间或镶嵌着红、白、黄、紫几色，绵延起伏，几十里几百里不断。
    迎着爽快的山风，沐着清鲜的花香，穿过弥漫的山雾，走在林海之中，忽然头上扑的一声，原来是一只鹌鹑飞过去了；身后又唰的一响，一头山鹿跑远了。这深山密林里藏着多少天鹅、山鹰、野猪、野牛、山兔、虎、豹、麂、猴等等飞禽走兽，可供狩猎啊！在那潺潺的溪水中，有时会游过一种不平常的鱼，有四只脚，形状别致，还会发出像婴儿啼哭的叫声，当地老俵称它为“狗鱼”，味道鲜嫩可口。关于它，山区传说着一件真实的故事：当年老俵曾捕捉到两条，特地送给毛主席尝尝。因为它是吃小鱼小虾长胖的，毛主席就拿它作比方，说它是鱼类中的恶霸，就像人类中的土豪劣绅一样，应该把它们和他们统统消灭掉！老俵们受到很大的启发和鼓舞，异口同声说：“狗鱼要吃掉，豪绅要打倒！”……
    井冈山上，举目所瞩，手脚所触，都是珍宝财富啊！它们沉睡了千年万年，自生自灭；直到最近这几年，才陆续被人唤醒，被人送到祖国社会主义建设所需要的各个地方去。
    为什么不早早开发呢？要是沿着当年毛主席和红军走过的羊肠小道（这道上每一寸都留下过他们的脚印和血汗啊！）翻山越岭走一遭，就会找到答案：井冈山峰峦重叠，山高路险，交通闭塞，人烟又少，开发它，并把资源往外运，可不是简单的事。何况，当时我们革命政权刚刚立足，打仗频繁，哪有力量向自然进军呢？
    1957年冬，七百多位下放干部、转业军人、上海青年走上了井冈山，和当地老革命、老俵们一起，立下宏愿、发出誓言：“红在井冈山，专在井冈山，一辈子建设井冈山；开发井冈山，支援全国各项建设！”自此以后，井冈山上日日夜夜轰隆隆，叮叮当，加上号子声，歌声，响成一片，组成了一支雄伟的建设山区的交响乐。井冈山面貌大变了，在第二代革命者的手里变得越发富饶、美丽了。
    公路修起来了。这都是些什么样的公路啊！单说从井冈山区中心——茨坪到当年毛主席朱总司令会师的砻市，公路全长五十公里，翻过五大天险之一的黄洋界，峰回路转，盘旋曲折，来回九叠。一位曾经修过康藏公路的工程师说，黄洋界公路的艰巨，未必比康藏公路好些。这样的公路，已经修起了四条，第五条、第六条、第七条……的计划，也在井冈山建设者们的脑子里逐渐形成了。公路之旁，当年的羊肠小道遗迹犹在，从崎岖陡险的羊肠小道，到平坦宽阔的公路，人们可以遥想我们中国革命曾经走过怎样艰难困苦的道路，伟大的领袖毛主席当年怎样肩挑背负着成百斤重的粮食……不，肩挑背负着中国革命的万斤重担，在艰巨的小路上翻山越岭，跋涉奔波；如今，革命终于胜利了，走上了康庄大道。公路把万宝山的丰富资源，大批大批投向了内蒙古、哈尔滨、上海的建设中去，也把各地所有、此地所无的物资，大批大批运上了山来。
    水力发电站也建设起来了。那是利用急湍奔腾的桐木岭的溪水建设起来的。人们在一个冬天里，同时间赛跑，终于赶过了洪水来到的时刻，使发电站在十周年国庆时开始供电了。这座水电站使得周围几十里的城镇、农村、工厂基本上电气化了。入夜，电钮一按，茨坪、白银湖、石狮口、大小五井，顿时光明如昼，好像万颗明珠，点缀在山上山下，井冈山成了不夜的山区。
    与公路、电站修筑同时，二十多座机械厂、化工厂、纤维板厂、酒厂、香水厂、竹雕艺术厂，纷纷落成，投进生产，规模是中小型的，办法是土洋结合的。特别值得一提的是综合利用的成果，使人惊叹井冈山人的智慧。如松树的综合利用，可以制造出松香、松脂、松烟、松焦油、松节油、松针油、松根油、松根煤油等几十种产品来。井冈山上的一草一木，在井冈山人面前，没有一样没有用处，没有一样不是无价之宝。
    井冈山人也在山高水冷、风大雾多的山区，从山脚到山顶筑起层层梯田，他们要叫这些梯田交出自吃有余的丰足粮食。如今，试种双季稻已经成功，亩产量最高的达到千斤。山区的粮食已经自给有余了。
    井冈山啊，万宝山！你从前为革命现在为建设，贡献出了多少东西！革命的人民在你的怀抱里一代一代生长，反过来又促进你发出更多的热和光。如今，你又在召唤，召唤人们把你的取之不尽、用之不竭的宝藏赶快开发出来，使你为革命、为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献更多更多的东西。革命的儿女们，正在从四面八方奔来，从南昌、从全江西省、从全国的许多城市和农村，来到你的身边，踏着毛主席和老红军们走过的道路，日夜劳动，使你的宝藏贡献得更多，使你的面貌变得更快更好！
