    The Commune Really Thinks of Everything for Us
    ·Our Reporter·
    Just after the Frost's Descent solar term, the canteens of the Zhongxing People's Commune in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, were equipped with heating devices, tidied up warmly, and prepared for the winter.
    We walked into each canteen, and they were all warm. Looking closely, the walls of the canteens were plastered with smooth yellow mud, some doors and windows had glass installed, and some were pasted with window paper, and the window cracks were also sealed with paper. Each canteen used the cooking fire to connect to warm brick beds and fire walls, which saved firewood and was warm. The administrator said: Even on the coldest days, the canteen will not be cold.
    What the commune members are most satisfied with is the commune party committee's concern for the members. A few days ago, Cui Guangfa, the first secretary of the commune party committee, personally went to the Yongyue Management District and worked with the members to successfully study the use of cooking fire to build underground stoves. This kind of stove has a wider heating surface than a heated brick bed and can heat from the feet up, making people feel warm as soon as they enter the house.
    Firewood and vegetables are important materials for the canteen to get through the winter. How are these things prepared? The person accompanying us on the visit said: There is plenty of firewood. Winter vegetables are also ready. He said: Each canteen has dug three to five vegetable cellars, storing a lot of fresh vegetables, and also storing a large amount of sauerkraut, pickles, dried vegetables, and frozen vegetables. We visited the vegetable cellars of several public canteens in the Satellite Management District, which contained Chinese cabbage, radishes, potatoes, etc. Director Wei of the commune, who accompanied us on the visit, looked at these abundant vegetables and added: "Each commune member who eats in the canteen throughout the commune can have an average of more than 500 catties of vegetables, enough to eat until next spring."
    During the short visit, we not only saw the winter preparations of several canteens in the Zhongxing Commune, but also heard the commune members unanimously praise: "The commune really thinks of everything for us."

    公社替我们想的真周到
    ·本报记者·
    霜降刚过，黑龙江拜泉县中兴人民公社的食堂就装上了取暖设备，拾掇的暖暖和和的，准备过冬了。
    我们走进每一个食堂，都热烘烘的。仔细瞧瞧，食堂四面的墙都用黄泥抹的溜光，门窗有的装了玻璃，有的糊了窗纸，窗缝也都用纸糊严了。个个食堂都利用做饭的火通了暖炕和火墙，既省柴，又暖和。管理员说：就是最冷的天，食堂里也不会冷。
    社员最满意的是公社党委对社员的关心。前几天，公社党委第一书记崔广发亲自到踊跃管理区，和社员一起，研究成功了利用做饭的火修建地下炉子。这种炉子比火炕发热的面更宽，能从脚底下热起，一进屋就叫人感到暖和。
    柴、菜是食堂过冬的重要物资，这些东西准备得怎样了？陪同我们参观的人说：烧柴很充足。过冬蔬菜也备齐了。他说：每个食堂都挖了三个到五个菜窖，贮藏了很多鲜菜，还储备了大量酸菜、咸菜、干菜和冻菜、我们参观了卫星管理区几个公共食堂的菜窖，里边有白菜、萝卜、土豆等。陪我们参观的公社魏主任看着这些丰盛的蔬菜，补充说：“全公社每个在食堂吃饭的社员，平均能有五百多斤菜，足够吃到明年开春。”
    在短短的参观中，我们不仅看到了中兴公社几个食堂的过冬准备工作，而且听到社员们异口同声地歌颂：“公社替我们想的真周到。”
