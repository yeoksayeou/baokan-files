    Bonn Dispatch: A previously unpublished work by the former fascist German dictator Adolf Hitler has recently been published in West Germany. The title is: "Hitler's Second Book."
    This book, promoting Nazi aggression and expansionist "foreign policy," is Hitler's second fascist work after "Mein Kampf." The book was completed in 1928. It is said that after writing the book, Hitler decided not to publish it for some reason and hid it in the Nazi publishing house in Munich. When fascist Germany was defeated in May 1945, the manuscript was confiscated by an American officer and taken to Washington, where it was stored in the U.S. National Archives.
    Now, when militarism has been revived in West Germany and Nazi fascist thugs are becoming increasingly rampant, some people in the United States feel that the work of the Nazi ancestor Hitler should no longer be buried. So the manuscript was brought back to West Germany by the Americans. The Bonn authorities treated it as a treasure and immediately published it, and exhibited it at a recent book exhibition to strengthen fascist militarist education among West German residents.

### 法西斯军国主义阴魂复活  西德出版“希特勒的第二本书”

    法西斯军国主义阴魂复活
    西德出版“希特勒的第二本书”
    本报讯　波恩消息：前法西斯德国的独裁者阿道尔夫·希特勒的一本未发表过的著作，最近已在西德出版。书名是：“希特勒的第二本书。”
    这本宣扬纳粹侵略扩张的“外交政策”的书，是希特勒继“我的奋斗”之后的第二部法西斯著作。此书完成于1928年。据说希特勒当时写成这书后，由于某种原因，决定暂不发表，藏于慕尼黑的纳粹出版社，1945年5月法西斯德国战败时，手稿被美国军官没收，带往华盛顿，收藏在美国国家档案处。
    现在，当军国主义已在西德复活，纳粹法西斯党徒日益嚣张之际，美国某些人感到，纳粹鼻祖希特勒的这部遗作，再也不应被埋没了，于是手稿便被美国人带回西德。波恩当局如获至宝，立即将它出版，并在最近举办的书刊展览会上展出，对西德居民加强法西斯军国主义教育。
