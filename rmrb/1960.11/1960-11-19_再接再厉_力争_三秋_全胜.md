　　Make Further Efforts and Strive for a Complete Victory in the "Three Autumns"
　　Anhui rushes to plant late wheat, Xinjiang expands the area for spring wheat winter sowing, and Shanxi seizes the time before freezing to launch a shock campaign of autumn plowing.
　　Jilin's autumn plowing is fast and good, Hebei strives for a good start and a good finish in the autumn harvest, and Sichuan wants to harvest all sweet potato products and by-products.
　　Hefei, November 18 (reported by this newspaper) – After basically completing the sowing of early and mid-season wheat, various regions in Anhui Province are now concentrating their efforts on rushing to plant late wheat.
　　This year, in Anhui Province, due to the large planting of late autumn crops and autumn vegetables, late wheat accounts for about 40% of the planned autumn sowing area. Therefore, quickly sowing enough late wheat has become the key to completing the autumn sowing plan. In order to rush to plant late wheat fields, various regions are prioritizing labor for autumn sowing from various aspects. Currently, the province has投入 more than 4.5 million laborers into autumn sowing.
　　When rushing to plant late wheat, leaders in various regions have been focusing on weak links. The Communist Party Committee of Bo County organized a large number of cadres to establish field headquarters in poor teams, backward teams, and areas with heavy late wheat sowing tasks to strengthen leadership, which effectively promoted the sowing of late wheat.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, November 18 – After overfulfilling the winter wheat sowing task, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is expanding the planting of "bao dan" wheat. By the beginning of November, the area sown with "bao dan" wheat in the region had reached 1.8 million mu, which is three times the total area of "bao dan" wheat last year. Currently, various regions are still increasing efforts to continue expanding planting.
　　Planting more and better "bao dan" wheat is an important measure for the Autonomous Region to strive for a large increase in grain production next year. "Bao dan" wheat is spring wheat sown in winter. This type of wheat should be sown before freezing, allowing the seeds to overwinter in the soil in a state of germination, and then emerge and grow after thawing the following year. Practice in recent years has proved that most areas of the Autonomous Region are suitable for planting "bao dan" wheat, and the yield is generally 10% to 30% higher than that of spring wheat. It can also reasonably adjust the sowing period of wheat crops, alleviate the tension of labor, livestock, machinery, and water during spring sowing, promote early maturity of spring wheat, reduce pests and diseases, extend the wheat harvest time, and reduce losses and waste. The southern Xinjiang region, which did not have the habit of planting "bao dan" wheat in the past, is also actively expanding the trial planting area this year.
　　Taiyuan, November 18 (reported by this newspaper) – Various regions in Shanxi are concentrating their efforts to seize the time before the ground freezes to launch a shock campaign of autumn plowing. As of the 10th, the province had plowed more than 24.7 million mu of land, accounting for 60.5% of the province's arable land. Plowing in the northern region is nearing completion, while the central and southern regions are entering a climax.
　　This year, Shanxi Province has a large replanting area, and the maturity period of some late autumn crops has been postponed. In addition, the late period has been rainy, which has brought many difficulties to the autumn plowing work. In order to ensure that universal plowing and deep plowing are achieved, party secretaries at all levels of counties, cities, communes, districts, and production teams are specifically leading the work, and each level is contracted. At the same time, reasonable arrangements have been made for labor, livestock, farming tools, and plots, and measures such as setting tasks, setting time, setting remuneration, and rewarding overproduction have been adopted for autumn harvesting, stubble removal, and autumn plowing.
　　In autumn plowing, various regions have also carried out autumn plowing on cotton stubble, waterlogged land, naked oat land, and remote land, which did not have the habit of autumn plowing in the past, eliminating the phenomenon of bare stubble land overwintering. The Dongzhen Commune in Wenxi County not only deeply plowed the land but also applied thousands of catties of base fertilizer per mu of land. In hilly areas, embankment scraping was carried out, and in sloping areas, field ridges were cultivated to ensure quality.
　　This newspaper reports that according to statistics from Jilin Province on November 10, the area of autumn plowing in the province has reached more than 1.2 million hectares, accounting for 26.3% of the total arable land area. The areas with faster progress, such as Jilin and Changchun, and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, have plowed more than 30% of the arable land area, and have basically completed the plowing task. The production center in these areas has shifted to threshing and sending grain for state purchase.
　　The quality of autumn plowing in the province this year is generally better. Of the area that has already been plowed, more than 384,000 hectares have a depth of about seven inches, accounting for 32% of the total plowed area, and the rest have also reached a depth of four or five inches. Many places have also paid attention to treating roots and stubble before plowing.
　　In the autumn plowing campaign, various regions have given full play to the role of machines, horses, cattle, and various tools.
　　While vigorously carrying out the autumn plowing campaign, the policy of both multiple planting and multiple harvests and high yields and multiple harvests has been further implemented, and great efforts have been made to autumn reclamation. According to statistics on November 10, the province has reclaimed more than 78,000 hectares.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 18 – The autumn harvest work in Hebei Province has entered the final stage. Various regions are launching a shock campaign to finish the autumn harvest, carrying out threshing and storage, re-harvesting and re-threshing, and striving for a good start and a good finish in the autumn harvest.
　　This year, due to the strengthening of leadership by party committees at all levels and the serious implementation of the Party's policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the autumn harvest work in Hebei Province has been early in action, fast in progress, careful in harvesting, and clean in threshing. According to statistics on November 8, the province has harvested grain and dug up all sweet potatoes, and 70% of the grain has been threshed. At present, various regions are launching a shock campaign to finish the autumn harvest, threshing and storing, and organizing forces to carry out re-harvesting and re-threshing, so as to achieve a good start and a good finish in the autumn harvest. Fengning County, in accordance with the spirit of overall planning and comprehensive arrangements, uses 30% of the labor force for autumn plowing, 30% for small autumn harvest, and 40% for shock threshing. Communes throughout the county have also universally promoted the method of organizing groups by threshing ground, contracting quotas, and rewarding overproduction to speed up the progress of threshing.
　　While launching a shock campaign of threshing and storage, various regions have universally carried out a campaign of careful harvesting and fine threshing, re-harvesting and re-threshing, striving to bring every grain into the granary.
　　Chengdu, November 18 (reported by this newspaper) – Rural areas in Sichuan are comprehensively harvesting sweet potato products and by-products. While carefully storing and processing sweet potato blocks, various regions are also collecting and storing all by-products such as sweet potato stems, vines, and leaves, and processing them in a timely manner, striving to make multiple uses of one item. The Xichong County Party Committee conducted a typical investigation to ensure that sweet potato products and by-products are grasped together: if all by-products are comprehensively collected and stored well, and rationally utilized, one mu of land can be equivalent to two mu of harvest. The county's 260,000 mu of sweet potatoes can harvest 200 million catties of by-products, which will play a great role in increasing grain and vegetables for people and increasing feed for pigs.
　　Party committees in various regions have also adopted methods such as organizing visits or holding on-site meetings and symposiums to widely exchange experiences in comprehensively collecting and processing sweet potato products and by-products in various regions, and promptly summarize and promote them. Ren Zongsen, reporter from Xinhua News Agency, took a picture of the members of Wangmei Production Brigade of Gaocun Commune in Wendeng County, Shandong, applying fertilizer in the high-yield wheat field to promote early rooting of wheat seedlings.

    再接再厉　力争“三秋”全胜
    安徽抢种晚茬麦　新疆扩大春麦冬种面积　山西赶在封冻前突击秋耕
    吉林秋耕快又好　河北力争秋收善始善终　四川要收净甘薯正副产物
    本报合肥18日电　安徽省各地在基本种完早茬、中茬麦后，正集中力量突击抢种晚茬麦。
    今年，安徽省由于晚秋作物和秋菜种得多，晚茬麦约占秋播计划面积的40％左右。因此，快种、种足晚茬麦，就成为完成秋播计划的关键。为了抢种晚茬地，各地从多方面优先满足秋播所需劳力。现在全省投入秋播的劳力已达四百五十多万人。
    在抢种晚茬麦时，各地领导都狠抓薄弱环节。中共亳县县委组织大批干部在穷队、后进队和晚茬麦播种任务大的地方，建立田头指挥部，加强领导，有力地推动了晚茬麦的播种工作。
    新华社乌鲁木齐18日电　新疆维吾尔自治区继超额完成冬麦播种任务后，正扩大种植包蛋麦。到11月初，全区播下的包蛋麦已达一百八十万亩，等于去年全部包蛋麦面积的三倍。现在，各地还在增加力量，继续扩种。
    多种、种好包蛋麦，是自治区力争明年粮食大增产的一项重要措施。包蛋麦即冬季播种的春麦，这种包蛋麦要在结冻前播下，让种子以萌芽状态在土壤里越冬，次年解冻后出苗生长。几年来的实践证明自治区大部分地区适于种植包蛋麦，产量一般比春麦高10％到30％，并可以合理调整麦类作物的播种期，减轻春播时劳畜力、机具和用水的紧张，促进春麦早熟，减轻病虫害，延续麦收时间，减少损失和浪费。过去没有种植包蛋麦习惯的南疆地区，今年也在积极扩大试种面积。
    本报太原18日电　山西各地正集中力量，乘地未结冻前突击秋耕，到10日止，全省已耕地二千四百七十多万亩，占全省应耕地面积的60.5％，北部地区翻耕将近结束，中部、南部正进入高潮。
    山西省今年复种面积大，部分晚秋作物成熟期推迟，加上后期多雨，给秋耕工作带来了不少困难。为了保证达到普耕、深耕，各县、市、社、区、生产队层层都有书记专门领导，层层包干，同时对劳力、畜力、耕具、地块等作了合理安排，采取定任务、定时间、定报酬和超额奖励的办法边秋收、边刨茬、边秋耕。
    各地在秋耕中，对过去没有秋耕习惯的棉花茬、下湿地、莜麦地、边远地等也都进行了秋耕，消灭白茬地过冬的现象。闻喜县东镇公社不仅深耕、耕过的土地每亩都施了几千斤底肥，丘陵地还进行了刮堰，坡地培地埂，保证了质量。
    本报讯　吉林省据11月10日统计，全省秋翻地面积已达一百二十多万公顷，占总耕地面积26.3％。进度快的吉林、长春地区和延边朝鲜族自治州翻地面积已达耕地面积的30％以上，基本完成了翻地任务。这些地区生产中心已转向打场、送征购粮。
    今年全省秋翻地质量一般都比较好。现在已经翻过的土地面积中，深度达七寸左右的有三十八万四千多公顷，占总翻地面积的32％，其余的也都达到四、五寸深。许多地方在翻地之前还注意处理了根槎。
    各地在秋翻地运动中，充分发挥了机、马、牛和各种工具的作用。
    在大力开展秋翻地运动的同时，进一步贯彻执行了多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，大抓秋季开荒，据11月10日统计，全省已经开荒七万八千多公顷。
    据新华社天津18日电　河北省秋收工作已进入最后阶段。各地正突击秋收的扫尾工作，进行打场入库、复收复打，力争秋收善始善终。
    今年，河北省的秋收工作，由于各级党委加强了领导，认真贯彻了党的大办农业、大办粮食的方针，行动早、进度快，收得细、打得净。到11月8日统计，全省谷物已收割，甘薯已收刨完毕，70％的谷物已脱粒。目前，各地一面突击秋收扫尾、打场入库，一面组织力量进行复收复打，做到秋收善始善终。丰宁县根据统筹兼顾、全面安排的精神，以30％的劳动力搞秋耕，30％的劳力搞小秋收，40％的劳力突击打场，全县各公社还普遍推行了按场编组、包工定额、超额奖励的办法，加快了打场进度。
    各地在突击打场入库的同时，普遍开展了精收细打、复收复打运动，力争颗粒归仓。
    本报成都18日电　四川农村全面收获甘薯正副产物。各地一面精细收藏处理薯块，一面把薯柄、薯藤、薯叶等副产物也都收净藏好，并及时分别加工，力争一物多用。西充县委为了保证甘薯正副产物一齐抓，进行了典型调查：如果各项副产物全面收净藏好，合理利用，一亩地可以顶两亩收成。全县二十六万亩甘薯可收获副产物二亿斤，这对于人增粮菜，猪增饲料都会起很大作用。
    各地党委还采取组织参观或召开现场会、座谈会等办法，广泛交流各地全面收藏处理甘薯正副产物的经验，并及时加以总结和推广。山东文登县高村公社望梅生产大队的社员，正在小麦丰产方里施肥，促使麦苗早盘根新华社记者　任宗森摄
