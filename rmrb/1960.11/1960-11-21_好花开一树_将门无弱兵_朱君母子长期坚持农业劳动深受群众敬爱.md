Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 20th: Zhu Jun, the deputy leader of Yangma Brigade in Guoshu Commune, Funing County, Jiangsu Province, persists in working and living in the countryside, wholeheartedly building a socialist countryside together with the masses, and is deeply respected by the local people.

Zhu Jun is the wife of Yan Youqing, the secretary of the Funing County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and has made contributions to the revolution. When Yan Youqing was the deputy secretary of the district committee and led the joint defense team to fight guerrilla warfare, she delivered intelligence to the joint defense team anytime and anywhere. During the period of socialist construction, she was equally loyal and worked for the Party and the people. She once took the lead in organizing mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives, actively participated in the people's commune movement, and led the masses to resolutely take the socialist road.

When Yan Youqing served as township head and district committee secretary in his hometown, he often stopped by to visit his family. After being transferred to the director of the county supply and marketing cooperative in 1950, he had less time to go home. Some kind neighbors said to Zhu Jun: "Secretary Yan has entered the city, your family should move to the city to live too, so you don't have to farm!" Zhu Jun smiled and said: "Before liberation, the whole family drank thin porridge and ate wild vegetables. Today we are liberated, and both he and I are Party cadres, working actively to accelerate socialist construction. He entered the city, so am I supposed to rely on him for a living and not work for socialism?" She also said: "If everyone runs to the city, who will farm the land? Where will the grain come from? Only when we all work together can we build our hometown even better." Her words were admired by everyone from the bottom of their hearts.

Zhu Jun has always maintained the hardworking style of enduring hardship before enjoying comfort in the countryside. In addition to completing her own work tasks, she participates in production, leads production, and does the equivalent of the labor days done by female commune members.

Under Zhu Jun's influence, her children have also developed a love for labor since they were young. The eldest son, Yan Yurong, is now a senior in high school. When he was nine years old, he followed his mother to weed and cut wheat. After entering middle school, he actively participated in agricultural production every time he came home for vacation. During this summer vacation, he did everything from carrying manure, weeding, and cutting grass. In addition to studying in the evenings, he worked like the commune members during work hours and after work hours. He worked for thirty-one days during the summer vacation, doing thirty-three work days, equivalent to the labor volume of a strong male laborer in a month. He was the best laborer among the ten middle school students in the entire brigade and was rewarded by the brigade Party branch. The second son, Yuhua, the third son, Yulou, and the fourth son, Yutai, also often participate in labor such as cutting grass and repairing roads. The commune members all say that Zhu Jun's family is a hardworking family where "good flowers bloom on one tree, and a general's family has no weak soldiers."

    好花开一树　将门无弱兵
    朱君母子长期坚持农业劳动深受群众敬爱
    据新华社南京20日电　江苏阜宁县郭墅公社杨马大队副队长朱君，坚持在农村劳动和工作，一心一意与群众一道建设社会主义的农村，受到当地群众的敬爱。
    朱君是中共阜宁县委书记严友庆同志的爱人，对革命有过贡献。在严友庆任区委副书记领导联防队打游击时，她曾随时随地给联防队送情报；在社会主义建设时期，同样忠心耿耿、为党为人民工作。她曾经带头组织互助组、农业社，积极参加人民公社化运动，领导群众坚决走社会主义道路。
    严友庆在家乡担任乡长、区委书记时，常顺便回家望望，1950年调任县供销合作总社主任后，回家的时间就少了。有些好心的邻居对朱君说：“严书记进了城，你家还是搬到城里去住，可以不用种田啦！”朱君却笑着说：“解放前全家喝一锅薄粥，吃野菜，今天解放了，我和他都是党的干部，都为了加速社会主义建设积极工作。他进了城，难道我就要靠他生活，不要干社会主义了吗？”她还说：“如果大家都往城里跑，田给哪个种？粮食从哪里来？只有我们大伙儿齐心干，才能把家乡建设得更美好。”她的话，说得大家从心眼里佩服。
    朱君在农村一直保持着吃苦在前、享受在后的艰苦奋斗的作风。她除了完成自己的工作任务以外，参加生产、领导生产，做的劳动日相当于同等女社员所做的劳动日。
    在朱君的影响下，她的几个孩子也都从小就养成爱劳动的习惯。大儿子严余荣，现在是高中三年级学生，他九岁时就跟母亲除草割麦。进中学后，每次放假回家都积极参加农业生产。今年暑假期间，他挑粪、除草、割草样样都干，除了利用晚上的时间学习以外，平时上工、下工和社员一样，一个暑假就劳动了三十一天，做了三十三个劳动日，相当于一个月内男强劳力的劳动量，是全大队十多个中学生中劳动最好的一个，受到大队党支部的奖励。二儿子余华、三儿子余楼、四儿子余台，也经常参加割草、修路等劳动，社员们都说朱君家是“好花开一树，将门无弱兵”的勤劳家庭。
