Lyric of the Ussuri River

The blue Ussuri River, quietly flows to the north.
Let me give all my deep affection, to your gentle waves.
Ah, you are a river of friendship,
The fishing songs of the two countries resound on the river;
Ah, you are a river of peace,
The river is filled with the starlight of the two countries.

I remember the snowy night when we first came,
We lit a bonfire on the riverbank,
And that sea of lights across the river,
Was also warming our hearts.
We drank the sweet river water,
And told the legends of the "August 15th" Red Army.
From that forest of rustling red-leaved oak trees,
We seem to still hear the war songs of that year.
We took the sweet river water as fine wine,
Raising our glasses to bless the brothers across the river.
Then, by the red light of the bonfire,
We designed the blueprint for our farm.

Today, the lights on both sides reflect each other,
Ah, the Ussuri River has become a golden river.
Life is just like the surging river water,
Flowing rapidly towards happiness.

    乌苏里江抒情
    萧英俊蓝色的乌苏里江，静静地流向北方。让我把全部深情，付予你轻柔的波浪。你啊，是一条友谊的江，江上两国的渔歌交响；你啊，是一条和平的江，江上盛满了两国的星光。记得初来时风雪的夜晚，我们在江畔烧起篝火，而那隔江的一片灯海，也在温暖着我们的心窝。我们饮着清甜的江水，讲述着“八一五”红军的传说。从那红叶萧萧的柞树林里，仿佛还听得见当年的战歌。我们把清甜的江水当做美酒，举杯为隔江的兄弟祝福。然后借着篝火的红光，设计着我们农场的蓝图。今天，两岸的灯光交映一片，乌苏里江啊成了金色的河。生活正像那奔腾不息的江水，高速地向着幸福的方向流着。
