    Strengthen Political and Ideological Work and Implement the Party's Policies
    Give Top Priority to Political and Ideological Work
    Any work is done by people, and people's actions are governed by their ideology. Without correct political views, it is like losing the soul. If politics does not take command, that is, if proletarian ideology does not take command, one will lose direction. At any time, in any work, we must adhere to putting politics in command, give top priority to political and ideological work, and do it thoroughly so that the completion of the task is guaranteed. Conversely, if politics does not take command, and political and ideological work is neglected or relaxed, not only will the task not be completed, but mistakes will also be made.
    Our Party has always attached importance to political and ideological work. However, can it be said that all comrades correctly understand the important significance of political and ideological work? Not necessarily. Some comrades are busy with affairs all day long, and do not seriously study the Party's principles and policies; some comrades regard political and ideological work as opposed to professional work, emphasizing the urgency of tasks and claiming there is no time for political and ideological work. Some comrades excessively emphasize the role of discipline and rules and regulations, and rely solely on administrative orders to do things. Some comrades seem to have grasped political and ideological work, but they cannot combine it with the central tasks, nor with the ideological situation of cadres and the masses, and there is a tendency towards superficiality and detachment from reality.
    Why does the phenomenon of neglecting politics and relaxing ideological work occur in some units and among some comrades? First, some comrades have insufficient understanding of the importance of the Party's political and ideological work, or have not yet learned how to do political and ideological work. Second, some comrades have ideological and work style problems, and their work methods are not correct. Proletarian ideology has not taken command well in their own persons, thus hindering the strengthening of political and ideological work. Third, there are erroneous understandings of some specific issues related to political and ideological work. For example, comrades who use administrative orders to replace political and ideological work mainly separate administrative orders from political and ideological work, and regard administrative discipline and rules and regulations as omnipotent. They do not understand that political and ideological work and administrative orders, discipline, and rules and regulations are complementary. Administrative orders, discipline, and rules and regulations can only fully play their role when accompanied by strong political and ideological work and under the premise of putting politics in command. Fourth, class viewpoints are blurred, and the understanding of the class struggle situation during the transition period is insufficient, and the long-term and complex nature of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front cannot be seen. This is the fundamental reason for neglecting or relaxing political and ideological work. A very important issue in strengthening political and ideological work is to strengthen the study of political theory. Leading cadres should set an example and lead the broad masses of cadres and people to study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's principles and policies, and frequently conduct socialist and communist education, and promptly criticize bourgeois ideology and the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the well-to-do middle peasants, so as to continuously improve the ideological consciousness of cadres and the masses.
    Political and ideological work paves the way for production and construction. Putting political and ideological work in the first place and strengthening socialist and communist education will inevitably greatly improve people's ideological awareness, more fully give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and the people, and ensure better, more comprehensive, and sustained leaps forward in production and construction. (Excerpt from the tenth issue of Guizhou's "Solidarity" monthly, author Huang Xuejing)
    How to Strengthen the Party's Ideological Work
    Strengthening the Party's ideological work is the central link in all work. This requires us to do ideological work more deeply, thoroughly, and meticulously. We must never assume that as long as we are doing good things, the masses will definitely support them, and that it doesn't matter whether we do ideological work or not. The fact is not like this at all. Without ideological work, good things are not understood and accepted by cadres and the masses, or, lacking correct work methods, often turn into bad things. Failure to do ideological work or doing ideological work very poorly will lead to two situations in the execution of tasks: one is commandism, and the other is laissez-faire. Commandism means forcing the masses to do things regardless of their level of awareness and the actual situation at the time and place. This is actually impossible to complete the task and will arouse the masses' resentment and alienate us from the masses. Laissez-faire, of course, cannot do the job well.
    How can ideological work be strengthened and done more deeply, thoroughly, and meticulously? We believe that the most important thing is to fully implement the Party's basic policies and various policies. At present, special attention should be paid to implementing the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation for developing the national economy. To this end, cadres should study the policies in depth, master them, and hand over all the policies to the masses so that they can understand and master them. This is an important link in implementing the policies. The initial summary of the work of some people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing recently shows that those communes that resolutely implement the Party's policy—the three-level ownership system based on the team—have made significant achievements in agricultural production and other aspects, and have fully demonstrated the superiority of the communes. It can be seen that whether cadres or the masses, only by understanding the policies and fully implementing them can they complete their glorious tasks and make outstanding achievements. The policies of the Party Central Committee are formulated based on Marxism and the actual situation of the Chinese revolution and construction, and the policies of the Central Committee have been proven to be completely correct by the practice of the revolutionary struggle of the masses. The task of our party organizations at all levels, the task of all party members and cadres is to meticulously and unreservedly implement the policies of the Central Committee in their entirety. This is the Party's fundamental requirement for organizations, members and cadres at all levels, and it is also the discipline and seriousness that every party member should have. This is the standard for identifying whether party organizations, members and cadres at all levels are correct and pure.
    To do ideological work well, we must follow the mass line and fully achieve communication between the top and bottom. With the development of the situation, what the masses are thinking in their hearts and what new trends they have in their thinking should be understood by the leadership in a timely and comprehensive manner so that these ideological problems can be fully analyzed and specifically solved. Similarly, the leadership's ideas, especially the requirements for implementing policies, must also be delivered to the masses in a timely manner, the reasons must be explained clearly to the masses, good people and good deeds in the implementation of policies must be widely disseminated, and various methods such as comparing the old and new societies must be adopted to educate the masses in response to different ideological trends.
    Our ideological work should always pay attention to starting from the overall situation. A comprehensive analysis should be made of the ideological trends of cadres and the masses, and the propaganda of various tasks should not be one-sided. The requirements for ideological work should not only pay attention to the seriousness of ideological principles, but also to the liveliness and vividness of the working methods. On the one hand, our ideological work must not be ambiguous about the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the boundaries of the Party's policies, and on the other hand, in carrying out the propaganda and education of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies, it must be combined with the actual situation at the time and place, and specific methods suitable for this situation and timing must be adopted. That is to say, in order to realize the principle, necessary flexibility should be allowed. However, this flexibility should have a certain limit and should not deviate from the Party's policy.
    In order to do the Party's ideological work more deeply, thoroughly, and meticulously, we must closely combine it with the arrangement of the masses' lives and the arrangement of work and rest, and practically care about and solve problems related to the interests of the masses in conjunction with the work of organizing production, strengthen various daily organizational work, and take practical and effective measures to further carry out ideological education work. (Excerpt from the editorial of the twenty-second issue of Beijing's "Frontline" magazine, "Doing the Party's Ideological Work More Deeply, Thoroughly, and Meticulously")
    Conduct Political and Ideological Work in a Thorough and Detailed Manner
    To carry out thorough and detailed political and ideological work, we must first deeply understand the ideological conditions of the masses so that political and ideological work is truly targeted and addresses the root cause. The thinking of the masses, like other things, is complex and diverse. Within a certain unit and within a certain period, there may be one or several common and universal ideological problems. This is the commonality and universality of the ideological situation. If we cannot see the commonality of the ideological situation and cannot grasp the main ideological problems that are universal among the masses, it will be impossible for political and ideological work to play a broad mobilizing role and to promote the smooth resolution of other ideological problems through the resolution of the main ideological problems. However, we must not ignore the individuality of the ideological situation. If we do not pay attention to studying the special ideological problems of different units and different people, it will be impossible to thoroughly solve the main ideological problems that are universal. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If a Communist Party member really wants to do propaganda, he must look at the target... It is absolutely impossible for someone who does propaganda work to not investigate, research, or analyze his propaganda target and just talk nonsense." We should seriously investigate, research, and analyze our propaganda objects, and earnestly correct and prevent the phenomenon of generalizing political and ideological work without investigation and research analysis.
    Secondly, we must guide political and ideological work with the thinking of continuous revolution, so that ideological education work is interlinked, step by step, and continuously improves the ideological awareness of the masses. In the ideological field, when old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions will arise; when new contradictions are resolved, newer contradictions will appear; and even the contradictions that have been resolved may reappear in front of us under new conditions. We must never be satisfied with the results that political and ideological work has already achieved, but after completing each political and ideological work task, we must immediately propose new tasks and conduct more in-depth and meticulous work based on the new situation.
    Third, we must closely combine solving ideological problems with solving practical problems, and promote the smooth resolution of practical problems by solving ideological problems, and make ideological problems more thoroughly solved by solving practical problems. In actual life, the situation is often like this: there are ideological problems in practical problems, and the reason why ideological problems arise is directly related to the existing practical problems. If only practical problems are solved and not ideological problems, practical problems will be difficult to solve smoothly; if only ideological problems are solved and not practical problems, ideological problems will be difficult to solve thoroughly.
    To do political and ideological work thoroughly and meticulously, it is necessary to make efforts in many aspects and solve problems in many aspects. At present, it is very necessary to pay attention to solving the following problems.
    First, the issue of understanding. At present, some units have truly recognized the urgent significance of carrying out thorough and meticulous political and ideological work, and have made achievements in this regard. However, some people still do not have sufficient understanding of the significance of doing so. Some people say: "Now the work is busy and the tasks are tight, and there is no time to carry out thorough and meticulous ideological work." However, precisely because we are in this situation, we need to carry out thorough and meticulous political and ideological work even more. Thorough and meticulous ideological work can mobilize people's enthusiasm, and once people's enthusiasm is fully exerted, our struggle will be invincible. In the current situation of busy work and tight tasks, as long as we truly carry out thorough and meticulous political and ideological work and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, the work tasks will definitely be completed more successfully.
    Second, the issue of work style. Whether political and ideological work can be done thoroughly and meticulously is extremely closely related to the work style of Party members and cadres. When Party members and cadres often eat, live, work, and discuss with the masses, they will quickly establish a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses that is as close as family. The masses are willing to tell Party members and cadres about their concerns, and Party members and cadres can also understand the ideological trends of the masses in a timely and specific manner. Effectively improving work style and earnestly adhering to the "four togethers" is an important issue related to whether political and ideological work can be done thoroughly and meticulously.
    Third, the issue of the team. Political and ideological work cannot be done well by relying on a few people alone. We should trust the masses and rely on the masses, earnestly implement the mass line in political and ideological work, and mobilize the broad masses to do ideological work. At present, some units not only mobilize all cadres to universally do political and ideological work, but also mobilize all Party members to do ideological work. Each Party member also contacts several activists, and each activist then connects several people, so that ideological work penetrates into every corner, everyone, and everything. With such a team, political and ideological work is guaranteed organizationally.
    Fourth, the issue of form. Appropriate broadcasts and persuasive mass rallies are forms that can be adopted. However, if we only rely on this form and do not adopt flexible and diverse forms that are popular with the masses, political and ideological work cannot be done thoroughly and meticulously. In this regard, there have been many successful experiences, such as: combining the thinking of the masses to calculate detailed accounts and specifically solving the ideological problems of the masses; mobilizing the masses to run their own exhibitions and on-site visits to educate the masses with facts; guiding the masses to recall and compare, and educating themselves with their own personal experiences; advanced figures sharing their own experiences and setting up living examples for the masses; frequently visiting and talking to people, and meticulously solving the ideological problems and practical problems of the masses, etc., these are all ideological work methods that can be widely adopted and have good results.

### 加强政治思想工作　贯彻执行党的政策

    加强政治思想工作　贯彻执行党的政策
    把政治思想工作摆到首位
    任何工作都是要人去做的，人的行动是由思想意识支配的。没有正确的政治观点，就等于失掉了灵魂。政治不挂帅，即无产阶级思想不挂帅，就会迷失方向。任何时候，任何工作，都必须坚持政治挂帅，把政治思想工作摆到第一位，并且做深做透，完成任务才有保证。反之，如果政治不挂帅，忽略或者放松政治思想工作，不仅完不成任务，还会犯错误。
    我们党是一贯重视政治思想工作的。但是，是否所有的同志都正确理解了政治思想工作的重要意义呢？还不能这样说。某些同志整天忙于事务，不认真学习党的方针政策，有的同志，把政治思想工作与业务工作对立起来，强调任务急，没有工夫做政治思想工作。有的同志过分强调纪律和规章制度的作用，单纯依靠行政命令办事。有的同志似乎是抓了政治思想工作，但是不能结合中心任务，不能结合干部和群众的思想情况，存在着表面化和脱离实际的倾向。
    为什么会在某些单位和某些同志中产生忽视政治、放松思想工作的现象呢？第一，有些同志对党的政治思想工作的重要性认识不足，或者还没有学会做政治思想工作。第二，有的同志思想作风有毛病，工作方法不对头，在他们自己的身上，无产阶级思想没有很好地挂帅，因而妨碍了政治思想工作的加强。第三，对一些有关政治思想工作的具体问题的认识有错误。比如用行政命令代替政治思想工作的同志，主要是把行政命令与政治思想工作截然分开了，把行政纪律和规章制度看作万能的东西。他们不了解政治思想工作与行政命令、规章制度是相辅相成的，行政命令、纪律、规章制度只有伴随之以强有力的政治思想工作，在政治挂帅的前提下，才能充分发挥它们的作用。第四，阶级观点模糊，对过渡时期的阶级斗争形势认识不足，看不到政治思想战线上社会主义革命的长期性和复杂性，这是忽视或者放松政治思想工作的根本原因。在加强政治思想工作中的一个十分重要的问题，是加强政治理论的学习。领导干部应当以身作则，带领广大干部和群众学习毛主席著作和党的方针政策，经常进行社会主义、共产主义教育，及时批判资产阶级思想、富裕中农的资本主义自发倾向，以不断提高干部和群众的思想觉悟。
    政治思想工作是为生产建设开路的。把政治思想工作摆到首位，加强社会主义、共产主义教育，必然会大大提高人们的思想觉悟，更加充分地发挥广大干部和人民群众的积极性和创造性，保证生产建设更好更全面的持续跃进。（摘自贵州《团结》月刊第十期，作者黄学经）
    如何加强党的思想工作
    加强党的思想工作，是一切工作的中心环节。这就要求我们把思想工作做得更深更透更细。我们决不能以为只要办的是好事，群众就都一定拥护，做不做思想工作都无关紧要。事实完全不是这么一回事。离开了思想工作，好事不为干部和群众了解和接受，或者缺乏正确的工作方法，往往就会变成坏事。不作思想工作或者思想工作做得很差，在执行任务时就会出现两种情况，一种是命令主义，一种是放任自流。命令主义就是不顾群众觉悟程度，不顾当时当地的实际情况，强迫群众去做。这样实际上是不可能完成任务的，而且会引起群众的反感，使我们脱离群众。放任自流当然也不可能把工作做好。
    思想工作如何加强，如何做得更深更透更细呢？我们认为最重要的是把党的基本政策和各项政策全部地贯彻下去。在当前特别要注意贯彻党的以农业为发展国民经济的基础的政策。这样，干部就应当深入地学习政策，掌握政策，并且把全部政策交给群众，让群众懂得它和掌握它，这是贯彻政策的重要环节。最近北京郊区有些人民公社工作初步总结的情况表明：凡是坚决执行党的政策——以队为基础的三级所有制的公社，都在农业生产及其他各方面有了重大的成就，充分发挥了公社的优越性。可见无论是干部或群众只有懂得政策，把政策全部地贯彻执行，才有可能完成自己的光荣任务，做出卓越的成绩。党中央的政策是根据马克思主义和中国革命和建设的实际制定的，中央的政策又是经过群众的革命斗争的实践所证明是完全正确的。我们各级党组织的任务，所有党员和干部的任务就是一丝不苟地，不折不扣地把中央的政策全部认真贯彻执行。这是党对于各级组织、党员和干部的根本要求，也是每个党员干部应有的纪律性和严肃性，这是鉴定各级党组织、党员和干部是否正确，是否纯洁的标准。
    要做好思想工作必须走群众路线，必须完全做到上下通气。随着形势的发展，群众的心里想些什么，他们在思想上有什么新的动态，领导上应当及时地全面地了解，以便于针对这些思想问题进行全面分析并予以具体解决。同样，领导方面的想法，特别是有关贯彻执行政策方面的要求，也必须及时地交给群众，把道理向群众讲清楚，把执行政策中的好人好事广为传播，针对群众中不同的思想动态，采取新旧社会对比等各种方法进行教育。
    我们的思想工作在任何时候都应该注意从全局出发。对干部和群众的思想动态要作全面分析，对各项工作的宣传不能带有片面性。对思想工作的要求既要注意思想原则上的严肃性，又要注意在工作方式上的生动活泼。我们的思想工作，一方面对马克思列宁主义基本原理和党的政策界限，不得含糊，而另一方面在进行马克思列宁主义基本原理和党的政策的宣传教育的时候，又必须结合当时当地的实际情况，采用适合这种情况和时机的具体办法。这也就是说，为了实现原则性，应该允许必要的灵活性。但是这种灵活性又应该有一定的限度，不能脱离党的政策。
    为了把党的思想工作做得更深更透更细，我们要密切地结合着对群众的生活安排和劳逸安排，结合着组织生产的工作切实关心并且解决与群众利益有关的问题，加强日常的各项组织工作，采取实际有效的措施，进一步开展思想教育工作。（摘自北京《前线》杂志第二十二期社论《把党的思想工作做得更深更透更细》）
    深入细致地进行政治思想工作
    要深入细致地进行政治思想工作，首先必须对群众的思想状况深知深解，使政治思想工作真正有的放矢，对症下药。群众思想也和其他事物一样，是复杂多样的。在一定的单位之中，在一定的时期，可能存在着一个或几个共同的、带有普遍性的思想问题。这是思想状况上的共性和普遍性。看不到思想状况的共性，抓不住群众中具有普遍性的主要思想问题，就不可能使政治思想工作发挥广泛的动员作用，通过主要思想问题的解决带动其他思想问题的顺利解决。但是，也不能忽视思想状况上的个性，如果不注意研究不同单位不同人物的带有特殊性的思想问题，也就不可能彻底地解决带有普遍性的主要的思想问题。毛泽东同志说：“共产党员如果真想做宣传，就要看对象，……做宣传工作的人，对于自己的宣传对象没有调查，没有研究，没有分析，乱讲一顿，是万万不行的。”我们应当认真对自己的宣传对象做调查、做研究、做分析，切实纠正和防止不做调查研究分析而使政治思想工作陷于一般化的现象。
    其次，必须以不断革命的思想指导政治思想工作，使思想教育工作环环相扣、步步深入，不断地提高群众的思想觉悟。在思想领域中，旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾就会随之产生；新的矛盾解决了，又会出现更新的矛盾；而且，就是已经解决了的矛盾，在新的条件下，也可能再次出现在我们面前。我们绝不能满足于政治思想工作已经收到的成效，而要在完成了每一项政治思想工作的任务之后，立即根据新的情况，提出新的任务，进行更深入更细致的工作。
    第三，必须把解决思想问题和解决一个个的实际问题紧密地结合起来，通过解决思想问题，促进实际问题的顺利解决，通过解决实际问题，使思想问题解决得更加深透。在实际生活中，情况常常是这样的：实际问题中有思想问题，而思想问题所以产生，又和存在着的实际问题有直接的关系。只解决实际问题，而不解决思想问题，实际问题就难以顺利解决；只解决思想问题，而不解决实际问题，思想问题也很难解决得深透。
    要把政治思想工作做得深入细致，需要进行多方面的努力，解决多方面的问题。目前，注意解决以下几个问题，很有必要。
    第一，认识问题。目前，有一些单位真正认识了深入细致地进行政治思想工作的迫切意义，在这方面做出了成绩。但也有些人至今对这样做的意义还认识不足。有人说：“现在工作忙、任务紧，没有时间进行深入细致的思想工作。”但是，正因为我们处于这种情况，我们就更需要进行深入细致的政治思想工作。深入细致的思想工作，可以调动人的积极性，而人的积极性一旦得到充分的发挥，我们的斗争就会无往不胜。在当前工作忙、任务紧的情况下，只要真正深入细致地进行政治思想工作，把广大群众的积极性充分调动起来，工作任务必定会完成得更加出色。
    第二，作风问题。政治思想工作能不能作得深入细致，与党员、干部的工作作风有着极为密切的关系。党员、干部经常与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，就会很快地和群众建立起血肉相联、亲如家人的关系，群众有什么心事都愿意向党员、干部说，党员、干部也可以及时具体地了解群众的思想动向。切实改进作风，认真坚持“四同”，是关系到政治思想工作能否做得深入细致的一个重要问题。
    第三，队伍问题。单靠少数人做政治思想工作，政治思想工作是做不好的。我们应当相信群众、依靠群众，在政治思想工作中切实贯彻群众路线，发动广大群众做思想工作。目前，有些单位不仅发动所有的干部普遍做政治思想工作，而且发动全体党员做思想工作，每个党员又都联系几个积极分子，每个积极分子再串连几个人，把思想工作渗透到每个角落，每个人身上，每件事当中。有了这样一支队伍，就使政治思想工作在组织上得到了保证。
    第四，形式问题。适当的广播和有说服力的大会动员，是可以采用的形式。但是，如果只靠这种形式，而不采用群众喜闻乐见的灵活多样的形式，政治思想工作就不可能做得深入细致。在这方面，已有许多成功的经验，比如：结合群众思想算细账，具体解决群众的思想问题；发动群众自办展览、现场参观，用事实教育群众；引导群众回忆对比，用自己的亲身经验教育自己；先进人物现身说法，为群众树立活的榜样；经常走访谈心，细致地解决群众的思想问题和实际问题，等等，这都是可以广泛采用、效果很好的思想工作方法。
