Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: The China-Albania Friendship Association held a reception tonight to warmly celebrate the 16th anniversary of Albania's liberation.

Albanian Ambassador to China, Palifti, and his wife, along with diplomatic officials from the embassy, Albanian foreign guests in Beijing, and students, were all invited to attend the reception.

Jiang Nanxiang, President of the China-Albania Friendship Association, spoke at the reception, which was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere. He warmly congratulated the Albanian people on their glorious festival, congratulated them on the great achievements they have made in socialist construction under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and wished them even more brilliant victories during the Third Five-Year Plan.

Jiang Nanxiang said: The Albanian people stand firmly at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and against modern revisionism. Our heroic and strong Albanian brothers, both in construction and in struggle, are worthy of being a strong member of the socialist camp and are fearless Marxist-Leninist fighters. In their actions, they have always demonstrated a strong fighting will and a high degree of revolutionary principles.

Jiang Nanxiang said that it is precisely because we have the common ideal of struggling for communism and the common struggle against the enemy that the fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries is developing and strengthening day by day. Our friendship has been tested and will continue to stand the test. The foundation and guiding ideology of our friendship—Marxism-Leninism—is a reliable guarantee of our eternal friendship, which will lead us from victory to victory.

Ambassador Palifti enthusiastically praised the fraternal friendship between the people of Albania and China in his speech. He said that we are celebrating the Albanian people's National Day here, just like we are at home.

The Ambassador spoke about his recent visit to Henan and his participation in the activities of people from all walks of life in Beijing celebrating Albania's National Day. He said that wherever we went, we became the target of the Chinese people pouring out their friendly feelings towards the Albanian people. At this moment, we can still hear the cheers of the Chinese people praising the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people.

The Ambassador said that when we are with Chinese comrades, we deeply feel that under the leadership of our two parties, the people of our two countries are holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and advancing together on the road of socialism and communism. There is nothing greater than this.

The Ambassador said that although our two countries are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts and minds are very close, and we can hear each other's heartbeats. Ambassador Palifti said that the greatest victory of the people of our two countries is to look at everything from a Marxist-Leninist point of view under the leadership of the Party. The people of our two countries will fight to the end to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, to oppose all non-Marxist-Leninist tendencies, and to hold the banner of Marxism-Leninism even higher.

Loud applause erupted in the hall when Jiang Nanxiang and Ambassador Palifti spoke.

Leading figures from various circles in the capital attended tonight's reception. Among them were Li Dequan, Luo Guibo, Xiao Hua, Zhang Zhixiang, Xia Yan, Qu Wu, Lu Xuzhang, Sa Kongliao, Huang Zhong, Feng Jiping, Lu Ping, Liu Baiyu, as well as Zhang Zongxun, Liu Ruilong, Yang Shuo, Yan Wenjing, Guo Xiaochuan, and others who had visited Albania.

    蒋南翔说：阿尔巴尼亚人民坚强地站在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义斗争的前线。我们英勇坚强的阿尔巴尼亚兄弟无论在建设中和斗争中，都无愧为社会主义阵营的坚强的一员，是马克思列宁主义的无畏战士；在他们的行动中始终表现了坚强的战斗意志和高度的革命原则。
    蒋南翔说，正是由于我们有着为共产主义奋斗的共同理想、对于敌人的共同斗争，我们两国人民的兄弟友谊正在日益发展、日益巩固。我们的友谊是经过了考验并且将继续经得起考验。我们友谊的基础和指导思想——马克思列宁主义，是我们永恒友谊的可靠保证，它将把我们从胜利引向胜利。

    大使说，当我们和中国同志在一起时，我们深深感到，我们两国人民在我们两国党的领导下，高举着马克思列宁主义的旗帜，在社会主义和共产主义大道上一起前进，没有什么再比这更伟大的了。
    大使说，我们两国相距万水千山，然而我们的心和思想都靠得十分近，我们互相可以听到心的跳动。帕里夫蒂大使说，我们两国人民最大的胜利，就是在党的领导下用马克思列宁主义观点来看一切事物。我们两国人民将为保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，反对一切非马克思列宁主义的倾向，为把马克思列宁主义旗帜举得更高而斗争到底。
