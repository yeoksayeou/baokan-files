    Ode to the New Era
    —Reading Kang Langshuai's "Song of the Dai People"
    Tao Yang
    "I want to sing of our nation, how it crossed from hell into heaven."
    "Song of the Dai People," by the Dai folk poet Kang Langshuai, is a beautiful long lyric narrative poem composed of seven odes. In this poem, through the rebirth of his nation and the earth-shaking changes in Xishuangbanna, the poet sings of the glorious achievements of the motherland over the past ten years and praises the great achievements of the Party and Chairman Mao.
    This ode to the new socialist era is extremely educational and of great aesthetic value. The poet has deeply rooted his poetry in the soil of his own nation, making vivid and profound depictions of the life of the Dai people over the past decade, and extraordinarily expressing the great spirit of the times and the new national spirit. The poet stands at the forefront of the times, singing on behalf of his nation with a strong sense of liberation and national pride. Because the poet reveals the beauty in life, and sings of his nation's boundless gratitude towards the Party and Chairman Mao, this ode is full of life and poetry in its thought and art. There is no doubt that this distinctive ode is a new development in China's odes. It is a flower of the Dai people's spiritual life, and a rising star in China's literary scene.
    In the prologue of the first song, the poet uses high artistic generalization to narrate the thousands of years of history from the beginning of the Dai people's pioneering work to their liberation. The ancestors of the Dai people hunted in the forests, cultivated land by slash-and-burn methods by the Lancang River, and thrived and lived in peace in the rich Xishuangbanna. But ever since the exploiting classes appeared on the earth, the leaders fought for the throne, the chieftains plundered the property of the people, and the sound of crying was heard at any time in the forest. When it came to the era of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the disaster became even more profound: "In the dark forest, you can't see the blue sky, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits are rampant in the forest like tigers and leopards, the feudal system is entrenched here like a poisonous snake, and the earth is covered with bloodstains." This sinful old world is what the poet calls "hell." However, the poet changes his tone: "Listen, brothers, the night will always pass, please do not be sad, my song will sing to the dawn of the forest." This glorious dawn refers to the new society after the founding of the People's Republic of China, to the free and happy new socialist era, which is what the poet calls "heaven." The poet's intention is obvious: only by starting from a clear contrast between the past and the present can the theme of how the Dai people "crossed from hell into heaven" be better expressed, and the ode be more persuasive. The ode begins here, and the poet's odes, one after another, are like the mighty river, "singing of the awakened nation and the awakened land together." What an amazing, awakened nation! They have leapt from slaves to become masters of the country and "masters of heaven and earth." The joyful era has made them so heroic and bold all at once: "Now the land is ours, the river must obey our orders, the sky is ours, if it doesn't rain, we will squeeze water out of the stones." And how rich and beautiful this awakened land is: "Jinghong's pineapples are sweeter than honey, Menghai's coconut groves are connected to the clouds," "Grain is paved into a golden carpet, and cotton fields are like distant cloud mountains."
    Each song is unique, but the most striking and exciting are the songs praising the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. The success of this ode lies in the poet's ability to select characteristic historical events, to grasp the beauty in life, and thus to express the high-spirited spirit of the times and the boiling reality of life.
    The poet uses lofty metaphors and poetic language to praise the General Line as the "lighthouse" that illuminates the happy heaven, to praise the Great Leap Forward as the "first spring of the Dai people," and to praise the People's Commune as the "gem on the Lancang River." Under the illumination of these three red flags, the Dai people, with the daring communist style of thinking and acting, and at a speed of "one day equals twenty years," created mythical miracles in Xishuangbanna. Look: "Large and small factories are like hens with chicks," "Countless chimneys are more beautiful than coconut groves," "The waterfall of the Liusha River Hydropower Station is like ten thousand galloping horses," "The steelmaking furnaces in the forest are shining like stars," the Manfeilong Reservoir is "like a golden lake in a myth," "The inexhaustible grain bends the newly built bamboo buildings, and songs of joy are boiling in every village." The poet uses colorful brushstrokes, thick and light, to depict a picture of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, fully expressing the unprecedented prosperity brought to Xishuangbanna by the "first spring," which is why the poet, on the holy bank of the Lancang River, praises the great envoys of this spring, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the most sincere and enthusiastic feelings.
    The poet especially loves life and is familiar with life, and observes life with his own national temperament and eyes. Therefore, the picture of the Great Leap Forward that he depicts is extremely vivid and expressive. When these pictures are presented to us, they are almost visible and tangible. This is also an important reason why this ode has a distinct national style and a strong atmosphere of life. There are many wonderful chapters that are charming. For example:
        Listen! Dai people!
        Last night, why was there golden light flashing in the forest,
        And the earth was shocked and shaking,
        And the Lancang River water splashed on both banks,
        It turned out that in the Dai people's villages,
        The first furnace of steel was smelted. If these verses are regarded as independent short poems, they can also be called a poem with a relatively perfect conception and a very novel artistic conception. This first furnace of steel is of great historical significance! In the Dai people's legends, it is believed that iron is a fallen star, but now the Party says: steelmaking, although the stars have not fallen, there is iron and steel, which is refined by "thousands of people mining ore and thousands of people pulling bellows." The poet can't help but cheer for this historical miracle: "Let people all over the world see, the first furnace of steel smelted by the Dai people, it is more precious than gold, it is brighter than silver. Since we have smelted the first furnace of steel, our forest! It will soon become heaven." True poetic art must contain profound thoughts. The poet so enthusiastically announces his nation's first furnace of steel to the world, which shows how strong the poet's feeling of pride for the motherland is.
    The poet's description of the girls in the commune's sewing factory is extremely romantic. The poet often combines myths, legends, or beautiful imaginations with reality, thereby strengthening the poem's appeal and beauty. Look! In order to dress up the girls in every village like Nannuona, the most beautiful princess in legends, they actually "pick the stars in the blue sky and sew them on the velvet skirts. Cut off the colorful clouds on the horizon and make shawls for the girls." Even the peacocks dare not display their feathers when they see them, and the bees fly to gather flowers. In these descriptions, the poet praises the revolutionary enthusiasm and beautiful ideals of these ingenious girls, and also praises the happy life of the People's Commune.
    In the section of the poem praising the commune's nursery, the new female figure of Aunt Yu Kan sculpted by the poet is exceptionally moving. Aunt Yu Kan is an amiable, diligent, and collectivistic new person. Although her only daughter starved to death in the famine before liberation, the forty children around her fill her heart with hope and happiness. Therefore, she raises every child as her own flesh and blood, feeding them milk during the day and borrowing starlight to wash their clothes at night. And when it is windy and rainy, she takes off her own cotton coat to cover the children. The poet uses a beautiful lyrical style to delicately portray the character and lofty spiritual world of this new figure. The poet sings: "Aunt Yu Kan, your hard work alone makes the mothers of forty children, and one day you dig a mountain flat. Although you didn't plant a banana tree on the high mountain, every banana leaf is putting its palms together for you, and the children will sing about you in the banana forest when they grow up."
    Kang Langshuai can be called an excellent national poet because he excellently expresses the great spirit of the times and the ideological outlook of the nation:
    We must write in our scriptures,
    Changes that have not occurred for thousands of years.
    Respected benefactor Chairman Mao and the Communist Party,
    Under the illumination of the General Line lighthouse,
    We Dai people do not offer sacrifices to Buddha or drip water,
    Everyone can step into heaven.
    History proves: The three red flags are a huge revolutionary force for promoting social development. They are the magic weapon for rapidly transforming the objective world, and also the magic weapon for rapidly changing and improving national ideological consciousness. A nation that believes in religion, believes that "not offering sacrifices to Buddha or dripping water" and "everyone can step into heaven," fully illustrates the change in a nation's belief and the remarkable revolution in a nation's ideological consciousness. As everyone knows, religion is a product of people's powerlessness against natural forces and social oppression. Lenin said when elaborating on the social roots of religion: "The exploited class, because it does not have the power to fight against the exploiters, will inevitably produce the vision of a happy life after death." (Lenin, "Socialism and Religion") The exploiting class uses religion as a tool to oppress laborers, and does everything possible to spread this consciousness, which is an important reason for maintaining religious beliefs from history. But today, when national oppression and class exploitation are eliminated, when natural forces can be overcome, the Dai people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious illumination of the three red flags, see the real heaven from real life and the communist vision. Due to the improvement of the Dai people's ideological awareness and the rapid development of social productive forces, the beliefs of the entire nation have undergone major changes and revolutions. The national belief is no longer in gods, Buddhas, and doctrines, but in the savior of mankind, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and in the beautiful socialism and communism. "Heaven" is not in the ethereal sky or the vague afterlife, but in real society, in the world, and must be created by one's own strength on one's own land. The poet expresses this new ideological outlook of his nation. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the illumination of the three red flags, the development of society and the development of national consciousness can cross several centuries in a short period of time.
    The poet sings of the rebirth of his nation and the brilliant achievements of the motherland over the past ten years. However, the poet deeply understands that these great achievements should be attributed to the glorious Communist Party and the leader Chairman Mao. Therefore, in the last song, the poet pours all his emotions into the poem, asking the peacocks to wash their gorgeous feathers in the Lancang River, and take the hearts of 250,000 Dai people to Beijing to bless:
        Flying bird! Fly! Fly!
        Take our double-season rice of harvest,
        Take the most fragrant Nuo Jinhua of Xishuangbanna,
        Take the first furnace of steel of the Dai people,
        Take the coconut fruit that is tied to the blue sky,
        Take the big pineapple dyed with the colors of twilight,
        Fly! Fly!
        Fly over thousands of miles of rice paddies,
        Fly over the high mountains and great rivers of the motherland,
        Fly over the ancient cities with brilliant lights,
        Fly to the place where 600 million hearts are beating,
        —Beijing!
        Tell our blessings from the Dai people,
        Tell our beloved Party,
        Tell our beloved benefactor.
    The Party and Chairman Mao are the guarantee and source of happiness for all ethnic groups. It is precisely because of the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao that every ethnic group in the great family of the motherland has been reborn, and the broad masses of people have unleashed infinite wisdom and creativity, creating miracles in the land of the motherland that have never been seen in human history. In today's excellent domestic and international situation, reading this inspiring ode to the joy of the motherland, we will feel incomparable pride. We have the wise leadership of such a great and glorious party and leader, and we will be more confident and leap forward towards the paradise of communism. No matter what difficulties in the world, no matter what reactionary forces in the world, can stop us.
    The reason why this ode is written relatively successfully is first determined by the poet's advanced world outlook and positive attitude towards life. Thanks to the Party's cultivation and support, the poet has become a person who cares about the interests of the country and the nation, a person who actively participates in battle and life. Therefore, he truly expresses the newborn and beautiful things in life in his works, and truly reflects the spirit of the times and the ideological outlook of the nation. It can be seen that only a person with advanced ideas and a full of emotion can write poems that are new and beautiful.
    At the same time, the long-term influence of traditional national folk literature on the poet's art is an important factor in making the ideological content and artistic form of this ode more perfectly combined. It can be seen that it is worthwhile to vigorously advocate that poets use national art forms to express the socialist ideological content. Developing socialist and communist poetry on the basis of the excellent traditions of national poetry is a correct path.

    新时代的颂诗
    ——读傣族诗人康朗甩的《傣家人之歌》
    陶阳
    “我要歌唱我们的民族，怎样从地狱跨进天堂”
    傣族民间诗人康朗甩的《傣家人之歌》，是由七支颂歌组成的一部优美的长篇抒情叙事诗。在这部诗里，诗人通过自己民族的新生和西双版纳翻天复地的变化，歌颂了祖国十年来的光辉成就，歌颂了党和毛主席的丰功伟绩。
    这部社会主义新时代的颂诗，极富有教育意义和美学价值。诗人使他的诗深深植根于自己民族的土壤里，对于傣家人十年来的生活图景，作了鲜明、深刻的描绘，异常生动地表现了伟大的时代精神和新的民族思想面貌。诗人是站在时代的前列，以强烈的翻身感和民族自豪感，代表自己的民族歌唱的。由于诗人揭示了生活中的美，唱出了自己民族对于党和毛主席的无限感激之情，因而，使这部颂诗在思想上和艺术上充满了生命和诗意。毫无疑问，这部富有特点的颂诗是我国颂诗的新发展。它是傣族的民族精神生活的花朵，也是我国诗坛上出现的一颗新星。
    诗人在第一支歌的序歌里，以很高的艺术概括叙述了傣家人的祖先从开始创业到傣家人翻身解放的几千年的历史，傣家人的祖先在森林里狩猎，在澜沧江边刀耕火种，在富饶的西双版纳蕃衍子孙，安居乐业。可是自从大地上出现了剥削阶级，领主互争王位，头人掠夺百姓的财产，森林里随时都听到哭声。到了国民党反动统治的时代，灾难就更加深重了：“漆黑的森林看不见青天，蒋匪像虎豹在森林里横行，封建制度像毒蛇盘踞在这里，大地上血迹斑斑一片腥膻。”这个罪恶滔天的旧世界也就是诗人所说的“地狱”。然而，诗人的笔锋一转：“请听吧，兄弟们，黑夜总会过去，请你不要伤心，我的歌啊，就要唱到森林的黎明。”这个光辉的黎明，是指中华人民共和国成立后的新社会，是指自由幸福的社会主义新时代，也就是诗人所说的“天堂”。诗人的意图是显而易见的，只有从今昔的鲜明对比开始，才能更好地表现傣族“怎样从地狱跨进天堂”这个主题，才能够使颂歌更富有说服力。颂歌就从此开始了，诗人一支又一支的颂歌，像滔滔的江水一样，“把醒来的民族和醒来的土地一齐歌唱。”这个新生的、觉醒的民族，是多么了不起啊！他们从奴隶一跃而成为国家的主人和“天地的主宰”，欢乐的时代使他们一下子变得如此英武豪迈：“如今大地是我们的，河水得遵从我们的命令，天空是我们的，天不下雨就把石头捏出水来。”这醒来的土地又是多么富饶美丽：“景洪的菠萝比蜜还甜，勐海的椰子林连着云天”，“谷子铺成黄金的地毯，棉田像远远的云山。”
    每支歌都是有特色的，但是最惹人注目、激动人心的是歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的歌。这部颂诗的成功之处，就在于诗人善于选择富有特征的历史事件，善于把握生活中的美，从而表现了斗志昂扬的时代精神和沸腾的现实生活。
    诗人用崇高的比喻和富于诗意的语言，称颂总路线是照亮幸福天堂的“灯塔”，称颂大跃进是“傣家人的第一个春天”，称颂人民公社是“澜沧江上的宝石”。在这三面红旗的照耀下，傣家人以敢想敢干的共产主义风格，以“一天等于二十年”的速度，在西双版纳创造出了神话般的奇迹。看吧：“大大小小的工厂，像带儿的母鸡一样”，“数不清的烟囱比椰子林还好看”，“流沙河水电站的瀑布，像万匹骏马在奔腾”，“森林里的炼钢炉呵，像繁星一样闪闪发光”，曼菲龙水库，“像神话中的金湖”，“吃不完的粮食把新盖的竹楼也压弯了，村村寨寨沸腾着欢乐的歌声”。诗人用五彩缤纷的笔触，浓涂淡抹，描绘了一幅幅工农业生产大跃进的图画，在这些美丽的图画里，充分表现了“第一个春天”给西双版纳带来的史无前例的繁荣景象，这就是为什么诗人在圣洁的澜沧江畔，以最真挚最热烈的感情颂扬这个春天的伟大使者共产党和毛主席的原因。
    诗人特别热爱生活和熟悉生活，而且是以自己民族的气质、以自己民族的眼睛洞察生活的，因而，他描绘的大跃进的生活图画是极其形象、极其传神的，当这些图画呈现在我们的面前时，几乎是可见的和可触摸的。这也是使这部颂诗富有鲜明的民族风格和浓厚的生活气息的重要原因。有许多精采的章节，具有迷人的美。比如：
        听呀！傣家人呀！
        昨夜，森林里为什么闪着金光，
        大地也震惊得摇晃，
        澜沧江水泼出两岸，
        原来是傣家人的村寨里，
        炼出了第一炉钢。如果把这些诗句当作独立的短诗来看，也称得起是一首构思比较完美、意境也很新颖的诗。这第一炉钢，是具有很大的历史意义的！在傣家人的传说里，认为铁是跌落的星星，可是如今党一句话：大炼钢铁，星星虽然没有跌落，却有了铁和钢，那就是“千百人打矿石，千百人拉风箱”炼出来的。诗人对这个历史的奇迹，情不自禁地欢呼道：“让全世界的人都看一看，傣家人炼出的第一炉钢，它比黄金更可贵，它比白银更光亮。自从我们炼出了第一炉钢，我们的森林啊！马上要变成天堂。”真正的诗歌艺术，必然包含着深刻的思想，诗人把自己民族的第一炉钢如此热情地向全世界宣布，就说明了诗人为祖国而骄傲的感情是多么强烈。
    诗人对公社缝衣厂的姑娘们的描写是极富浪漫色彩的，诗人常常把神话、传说或美丽的想像和现实结合起来，从而加强了诗的感染力和美感。请看！这些姑娘们为了要把每个村子里的姑娘打扮得像传说中最美丽的公主婻婼娜一样，她们居然“摘下蓝天里的星星，缝在丝绒的统裙上。剪下天边的彩霞，做成姑娘们的披毯。”甚至于要让孔雀见了不敢开屏，蜜蜂见了飞来采花。诗人在这些描写里，赞美了这些心灵手巧的姑娘们的革命干劲和美好的理想，也赞美了人民公社的幸福生活。
    在歌颂公社托儿所的一节诗里，诗人所塑造的玉坎大妈这个新的妇女典型是异常动人的。玉坎大妈是一个和蔼、勤恳和具有集体主义思想的新人物，虽然她唯一的女儿，在解放前的荒年饿死了，可是四十个幼儿在她的身旁，使她的心里充满了希望和幸福感，因而，她把每一个孩子都当自己的骨肉抚养，白天喂奶，黑夜还借星光洗衣裳。而刮风下雨的时候，她还脱下自己的棉袄给孩子盖上。诗人用优美的抒情笔调，细腻地刻划了这个新人物的性格和崇高的精神世界。诗人唱道：“玉坎大妈呀，你一个人的辛劳，使四十个孩子的母亲，一天挖平了一座山。虽然你没去高山上种一棵芭蕉，但每一片芭蕉都在向你合掌，孩子们长大也会在芭蕉林里把你歌唱。”
    康朗甩堪称为一位优秀的民族诗人，因为他出色地表现了伟大的时代精神和民族的思想面貌：
    要在我们的经书上写下，
    千年万年未有的变化。
    敬爱的恩人毛主席共产党，
    我们傣家人在总路线灯塔照耀下，
    不赕佛不滴水，
    人人都可以跨上天堂。
    历史证明：三面红旗是多么巨大的促进社会发展的革命力量，它是迅速改造客观世界的法宝，同时也是迅速改变和提高民族思想意识的法宝。一个信仰宗教的民族，认为“不赕佛不滴水”，“人人都可以跨上天堂”，就充分说明了一个民族信仰的改变，一个民族思想意识上的了不起的革命。大家都知道，宗教是人们对于自然势力以及对于社会压迫的无能为力的产物，列宁在阐述宗教产生的社会根源时说过：“被剥削阶级由于没有力量同剥削者进行斗争，必然会产生对死后的幸福生活的憧憬。”（列宁《社会主义与宗教》）而剥削阶级利用宗教作为压迫劳动者的工具，千方百计地传播这种意识，则是使宗教信仰从历史上保持下来的一个重要原因。可是在今天，当消除了民族压迫和阶级剥削的时候，当能够战胜自然势力的时候，傣族人民在党和毛主席的领导之下，在三面红旗的光辉照耀之下，从现实生活里和共产主义的远景里，看见了真正的天堂。由于傣族人民思想觉悟的提高和社会生产力的迅速发展，使整个民族的信仰起了重大的变化和革命，这个民族信仰的不再是什么神灵、佛爷和教义，而是“信仰”的人类的救星共产党和毛主席，“信仰”的美好的社会主义和共产主义。“天堂”也不是在虚无飘渺的天上或渺茫的来世，而是在现实社会中、在人间，并且要靠自己的力量在自己的土地上进行创造。诗人表现了自己民族的这种崭新的思想面貌。在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在三面红旗的照耀下，社会的发展和民族意识的发展，可以在一个短短的时期内跨过几个世纪。
    诗人歌颂了自己民族的新生和祖国十年来的辉煌成就，可是，诗人深深理会这一点，这些伟大的功绩，应该归于光荣的共产党和领袖毛主席。因此，在最后一支歌里，诗人把全部的感情灌注在诗篇里，请开屏的孔雀在澜沧江里洗净绚烂的羽毛，带着二十五万颗傣家人的心，飞向北京去祝福：
        飞雀呀！飞吧！飞吧！
        带着我们丰收的双季稻，
        带着西双版纳的最香的糯金花，
        带着傣家人的第一炉钢，
        带着结在蓝天的椰子果，
        带着彩霞染过的大菠萝，
        飞呀！飞呀！
        飞过万里迢迢的稻田，
        飞过祖国的高山大河，
        飞过一座座灯光辉煌的古城，
        飞到那跳动着六亿颗心的地方，
        ——北京！
        把我们傣家人的祝福，
        告诉我们敬爱的党，
        告诉我们敬爱的恩人。
    党和毛主席是各族人民的幸福的保证和源泉，正是由于党和毛主席的英明领导，祖国大家庭里的每个民族，才获得了新生，广大的人民群众才发挥出了无穷的智慧和创造力，在祖国的土地上创造出了人类历史上从未有过的奇迹。处在国内外大好形势的今天，读一读这部鼓舞人心的祖国的欢乐颂，我们就会感到无比的骄傲，我们有这样伟大、光荣的党和领袖的英明领导，我们就会更加信心百倍地向着共产主义的极乐世界奔腾跃进，世界上无论什么困难，世界上无论什么反动势力，都是阻挡不住的。
    这部颂诗，所以写得比较成功，首先是由诗人的先进的世界观和积极的生活态度决定的，由于党的培养和扶植，诗人成了一个关心国家和民族利益的人，一个积极投入战斗和生活的人，因而，在自己的作品中真正表现了生活中新生的、美的事物，真正反映了时代精神和民族的思想面貌。由此可见，首先是一个思想先进的人，感情充沛的人，才能写出又新又美的诗。
    同时，由于诗人在艺术上受过传统的民族民间文学的长期熏淘，是使这部颂诗的思想内容和艺术形式得到比较完美结合的重要因素。由此可见，诗人用民族的艺术形式，表现社会主义的思想内容，是应该大加提倡的。在民族诗歌优良传统的基础上发展社会主义和共产主义的诗歌，是一条正确的道路。
