    Earnestly Strengthen Political and Production Education for Transferred Personnel
    The Guwu Team's New Commune Members Aspire to Vigorously Develop Agriculture
    Resolve to Settle Down in the Countryside for the Long Term, and Strive to Learn Technology and Improve Production
    (Our dispatch) The Party Branch of the Guwu Production Team of Xiaomiao Brigade, Chengguan Commune, Fengtai County, Anhui, has strengthened ideological education for new commune members, enabling them to establish the idea of settling down in the countryside for the long term.
    In the upsurge of all sectors of society vigorously supporting agricultural production, this team received sixty-three new commune members transferred from cadres, workers, family members, and urban residents. These new laborers account for more than 40% of the team's semi-able-bodied labor force. In order to help these new commune members enhance their understanding and give full play to their enthusiasm for production, the production team's Party branch has taken effective measures to carry out ideological education work among these new members, focusing on agriculture as the foundation and the idea of settling down to agricultural production with peace of mind. First, responsible comrades from the county Party committee and the commune were invited to give reports, explaining the importance of doing a good job in agricultural production. The new commune members were also organized to study the People's Daily editorial "The Whole Party Gets Involved, The Whole People Get Involved, Vigorously Develop Agriculture, Vigorously Develop Grain" and other relevant documents, studying and discussing while combining theory with practice, linking with their own thoughts, and fully expressing everyone's understanding of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain. At the same time, the production team also held a small exhibition, displaying the facts of the bumper harvests of sweet potatoes, rice, and cotton in the team and the promotion of other production development, illustrating that agriculture is the foundation for developing all undertakings. Through study, discussion, and visits, the idea that agriculture is the foundation, and grain is the foundation of the foundation, has taken root in people's hearts. Now the new commune members generally realize that eating and clothing depend on agriculture, and all sectors of society are rooted in agriculture. If agricultural production is not done well, other production will not be able to develop. More than thirty new personnel transferred from Chengguan Street have written letters of determination; more than a dozen workers from textile factories and gunny sack factories have also formulated production plans.
    While strengthening the ideological education of new commune members, this production team, in terms of production, also takes into account their previous lack of participation in agricultural production, their lack of understanding of production technology, and the different strengths of each individual, adheres to the principle of adapting to people and making reasonable use of them, and properly carries out division of labor and arrangements. When they first arrived, they were all assigned to do some light and simple work, and the working hours were also slightly shorter than those of the old commune members. When they gradually adapted to rural labor, they were gradually increased from light to heavy, from simple to complex, slowly increasing the amount of labor and gradually improving labor efficiency. For women laborers, they are generally assigned more light work, such as weeding, thinning, topdressing, and harvesting; young lads are assigned to do some heavy work, such as transporting manure and plowing; auxiliary laborers are led by special personnel to engage in re-harvesting. These farm works are adapted to each person's situation, and thus their role has been fully brought into play. For example, some family members and citizens, although they have not engaged in agricultural production in the past, have relied on themselves to collect all the burning grass for their families in the past, and they can use scythes. It is relatively skilled to assign them to cut rice and soybeans. Others have built vegetable gardens in the suburbs in the past, and they are assigned to manage the vegetable gardens.
    In order to enable new commune members to quickly improve their operating skills and be able to discover and solve key problems in production in a timely manner, this production team is equipped with cadres and experienced old commune members for each farm work to provide technical guidance. New and old commune members have also signed contracts for guaranteed teaching and guaranteed learning, teaching and learning while doing. For example, among the women assigned to manage carrots, some people cannot thin seedlings or are reluctant to thin seedlings. After Sun Fengyi, the deputy secretary of the commune Party committee who participated in production in this team, and Zhang Shiping and other old commune members who served as technical instructors discovered this, in addition to patiently teaching them the method of thinning seedlings, they also repeatedly explained the importance of thinning seedlings, thereby improving the efficiency and technology of thinning seedlings. For example, when cutting rice, some new commune members used too much force like cutting grass, scattering a lot of grain; and some could not hold the rice stalks well, cut less, and the efficiency was very low. Old commune member Wu Peiying and others immediately divided the process for demonstration performances, the first time to teach how to hold rice stalks, the second time to teach how to use a knife, and the third time to teach how to put down rice mats. Due to repeated demonstration performances and patient help and guidance, the operating skills of the new commune members were quickly improved. Zhang Jilan, who had never cut rice before, mastered the rice cutting technology skillfully after only two days of study, and could cut one and a half mu per day, doubling the efficiency and improving the quality. In order to teach the new laborers the technology of using rubber-wheeled vehicles, the old commune members also adopted the method of one old leading one new, and on winding and uneven roads, the old commune members pushed and the new commune members supported, watching the old commune members' movements and listening to the old commune members explaining the key points such as keeping the center of gravity steady when pushing the car; on flat roads, the new commune members were allowed to experiment, and the old commune members guided. In this way, some new commune members who were assigned to transportation could quickly push the car alone. Through the activity of guaranteeing teaching and guaranteeing learning, not only did these new commune members quickly master the agricultural skills of plowing, pushing carts, cutting rice, and threshing, but also the relationship between the new and old commune members was also close. They established a deep friendship in production practice, which enhanced the confidence of the new commune members in doing a good job in agricultural production and the determination to build a new countryside together with the old commune members, and they were more at ease with agricultural production.
    In order to make new commune members settle down to agricultural production, the Party branch paid great attention to the living arrangements of the new commune members. When this group of new commune members first arrived, they were warmly received by the broad masses of cadres and people. The old commune members vacated more than 20 houses and a large number of beds, tables, chairs, benches and other furniture for them, and also helped them reclaim some scattered land in front of and behind their houses and plant vegetables in time. Before the vegetables grew, the old commune members also took the initiative to send some vegetables to them to adjust their lives. The canteen managers and cooks often solicited their opinions, and among the new commune members, they selected some representatives to participate in the work of the canteen management committee, so that they quickly eliminated the idea of being "guests." If individual new commune members became ill, the cadres and commune members were even more caring. Zhang Shaoying's child fell ill, and old commune member Wu Peiying ran four or five miles at night to ask a doctor. Duan Maoying, the secretary of the Party branch, poured tea and water and was busy all night. Zhang Shaoying said with gratitude: "The cadres and commune members care about me so much, I guarantee to work hard to do a good job in production in the future." Recently, the weather has gradually become cold, and the Party branch found that some of the new commune members had not brought cotton clothes, so they sent the production captain to lead three commune members to rush to the county seat overnight to take cotton clothes for them door to door. Overnight, they traveled more than 50 miles back and forth and brought back all the missing cotton clothes. Some new commune members said with emotion: "This place is better than my own home, and we never want to leave!"
    At present, the Party branch of this production team is further promoting the idea of being red in the countryside, specializing in the countryside, and aspiring to build a new socialist countryside among these new commune members by inserting red flags and establishing pace-setters. Communist Youth League member Xie Jihua said: We must settle down in the countryside for the long term. In more than a month, she has learned various complex farm works such as plowing, harrowing, and sowing.

    切实加强对下放人员的政治教育和生产教育
    鼓武队新社员立志大办农业
    决心长期在农村安家落户，努力学习技术搞好生产
    本报讯　安徽凤台县城关公社肖庙大队鼓武生产队党支部，加强对新来社员的思想教育，使他们确立了长期在农村安家落户的思想。
    在各行各业大力支持农业生产的高潮中，这个队接收了从干部、职工、家属和城镇居民中下放来的六十三个新社员，这批新来劳力占全队整半劳力的40％以上。为了帮助这些新来社员提高认识，充分发挥生产积极性，生产队党支部采取了有效措施，在这些新来的社员中进行了以农业为基础和安心农业生产的思想教育工作。先是请一些县委下放来的和公社的负责同志作了报告，说明搞好农业生产的重要意义。并组织新来社员学习了人民日报“全党动手、全民动手，大办农业、大办粮食”的社论和其他有关文件，边学习边讨论，结合实际，联系思想，充分发表每个人对大办农业、大办粮食的认识。同时，生产队还举行了小型展览会，展出了本队山芋、水稻、棉花丰收和促进其他生产发展的事实，说明农业是发展一切事业的基础。通过学习、讨论、参观，使农业是基础、粮食是基础的基础的思想深入人心。现在新社员普遍认识到吃饭穿衣都靠农业，各行各业都打农业扎根，农业生产搞不好，其他生产也发展不起来的道理。城关街道下放的三十多名新来人员，都写了决心书；纺织厂、麻袋厂的十几个职工，还制订了生产计划。
    这个生产队在加强新社员思想教育的同时，在生产上还根据他们以往参加农业生产时间少，不懂生产技术和每个人各有所长等特点，本着因人制宜、合理使用的原则，妥善地进行分工和安排。初来时，一律分配作些轻活、简单活，劳动时间也比老社员稍微短些，等他们逐渐适应农村劳动了，再由轻到重，由简单到复杂，慢慢增加劳动量和逐步提高劳动效率。对于妇女劳力，一般多分一些轻活，如除草、间苗、追肥和收割等；年轻小伙子就分配干些重活，如运粪、耕地等；辅助劳力则由专人领导搞复收。这些农活都适应每个人的情况，因而也就充分发挥了他们的作用。例如有些家属和市民，过去虽没搞过农业生产，但以往家庭的烧草全靠自己采集，她们都会使用镰刀，分配她们割稻、割黄豆，就比较熟练。另有一些人过去在城郊兴过菜园，就分配她们管理菜园。
    这个生产队为了使新来社员迅速提高操作技术，能及时发现并解决生产中的关键问题，每项农活都配有干部和有经验的老社员进行技术指导，新老社员之间还订立了包教保学的合同，边干边教边学。例如分配管理胡萝卜的妇女中，有一些人不会间苗和舍不得间苗，在这个队参加生产的公社党委副书记孙凤仪和担任技术指导的老社员张士平等发现后，除耐心教会她们间苗的方法外，还反复说明间苗的重要性，从而提高了间苗工效和技术。又如割稻时，有些新社员像砍草一样，用力过猛，撒粒很多；还有的握不好稻把子，割得少，工效很低。老社员吴佩英等立即分工序进行示范表演，第一次教握稻把子，第二次教用刀，第三次教放稻铺子。由于反复进行示范表演，耐心帮助指导，很快提高了新来社员的操作技术。原来没有割过稻的张吉兰，仅经两天学习，就熟练地掌握了割稻技术，每天能割一亩半，工效提高一倍，质量也很好。为了教会新来劳力使用胶轮车的技术，老社员们还采取一老带一新的办法，在转弯抹角和高低不平的路上，由老社员推，新来社员扶，边看老社员的动作，边听老社员讲解推车要把稳重心等要点；在平坦的路上，就让新来社员试验，老社员指导。这样就使一些分工搞运输的新社员很快能够单独推车。通过包教保学活动，不仅使这些新来社员很快掌握了犁地、推车、割稻、打场等农活技术，也密切了新老社员之间的关系，他们在生产实践中建立了深厚的友谊，这样就增强了新来社员搞好农业生产的信心和与老社员一起建设新农村的决心，更加安心农业生产了。
    为了使新社员安心农业生产，党支部极其注意对新来社员的生活安排。这批新社员刚到时，就受到广大干部和群众的热情接待，老社员为他们腾出二十多间房屋和大批床、桌、椅、板凳等家具，还帮助他们在家前屋后开垦了一些零星土地，及时种上蔬菜。在蔬菜还没有长起来以前，老社员还主动地送一些蔬菜给他们调剂生活。食堂管理人员和炊事人员经常征求他们的意见，并且在新来社员中，由他们选派一部分代表参加食堂管理委员会的工作，使他们很快消除了作“客”思想。个别新来社员生了病，干部和社员更是关怀备至。张少英的孩子害了病，老社员吴佩英连夜跑了四五里路去请医生，党支部书记段茂英端茶送水整整忙了一夜。张少英感激万分地说：“干部、社员对俺这样关心，我今后保证努力搞好生产。”最近天气逐渐寒冷，党支部发现新来社员中间还有一些人棉衣没有带来，于是就派生产队长亲自带领三个社员连夜赶到县城挨门逐户给他们取棉衣，一夜之间，往返五十多里，把所缺棉衣全都拿来了。有的新社员感动地说：“这里比自己家里还好，我们啥时候也不想走啦！”
    目前，这个生产队党支部进一步在这些新来社员中通过插红旗、树标兵的方法，大大发扬了红在农村，专在农村，立志建设社会主义新农村的思想。共青团员谢纪华表示：一定要在农村长期安家落户。一个多月来，她就学会了犁地、耙地、耩地等各种比较复杂的农活。
