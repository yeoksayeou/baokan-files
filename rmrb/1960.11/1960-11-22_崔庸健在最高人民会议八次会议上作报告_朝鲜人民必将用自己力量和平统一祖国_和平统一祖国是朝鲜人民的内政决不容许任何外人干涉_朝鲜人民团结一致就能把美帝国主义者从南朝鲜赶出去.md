Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 20th: Choe Yong-gon, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, delivered a report on "Further Promoting the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland" at the Second Session of the Eighth Supreme People's Assembly of Korea on the afternoon of the 19th.

The report first pointed out that the realization of the peaceful reunification of the fatherland is the greatest desire of the Korean people at present and the supreme task of the nation.

The report said that in his report at the rally celebrating the 15th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on August 15, Premier Kim Il-sung once again clarified the firm position of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the issue of national reunification and the basic principles on peaceful reunification, and put forward a new plan. This once again proves the sincere efforts of the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which have consistently struggled for the peaceful reunification of the country. Premier Kim Il-sung's plan is an extremely realistic and reasonable path based on a correct analysis of the current domestic and international situation. This plan has aroused great reaction at home and abroad, and has been absolutely supported and agreed to, and has also widely resonated among the people of all classes in South Korea. Among the South Korean people, the call for the issue of reunification to be resolved by the Korean people with their own subjective strength is getting higher and higher.

At present, the enthusiasm of the South Korean people to realize reunification is unprecedentedly high, and they have shown a high degree of initiative to realize this great cause with their own strength.

The report then pointed out that it is by no means accidental that the South Korean people have launched such an active struggle. The serious consequences caused by the division of the country are becoming more and more obvious in the entire socio-economic life of South Korea. The South Korean people are no longer willing to live in the current environment, and at the same time, they absolutely cannot live like this anymore. The national economy of South Korea has been comprehensively bankrupt and declining. The national industry, which should be the leading sector in economic life, was originally very weak, and is now even more declining. In the South Korean countryside, feudal exploitation relations continue, the peasant economy is becoming more and more impoverished, and agricultural production is further reduced. In the South Korean economy, the organic link between industrial sectors and between industry and agriculture has been cut off, and the colonial deformity has deepened, making it impossible to imagine the independent development of the economy. Today, the economic situation in South Korea has fallen into a more cruel colonial situation than the dark rule of Japanese imperialism. The South Korean people can no longer endure all the social evils and extremely difficult lives caused by fifteen years of colonial rule, and finally rose up in April this year to launch a heroic struggle against the oppressors.

The report pointed out that today, half a year after the traitor Syngman Rhee was driven out, the situation has not changed at all, but has been deteriorating. Although the current "government" of South Korea has put forward various false slogans in view of the revolutionary momentum of the people, the lives of the people are becoming more and more mired in misery.

The report emphasized that facts have proved that the current regime in South Korea is essentially no different from the Syngman Rhee "government." People from all walks of life in South Korea have learned lessons through their own actual lives and have embarked on a new path of struggle more widely.

The report then pointed out that today, the only way to eliminate the devastating crisis formed in South Korea and save the lives of the people who are in misery is to realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and rely on the strong economic strength of the northern half. This is a realistic and urgent requirement and a lofty national obligation that can no longer be delayed. The report said that the reunification of the country has not yet been realized due to the interference of the American aggressive forces occupying South Korea and the stubborn obstruction of its loyal servants. The history of the fifteen years since liberation is full of sharp struggles between these two opposing lines on the issue of unifying Korea. The report then convincingly illustrated this with a wealth of historical facts.

The report pointed out that for more than ten years, the South Korean authorities have only done one thing. That is, they repeatedly shouted "northward unification" like a dream. This has been unanimously opposed by the Korean people and severely condemned by world public opinion. The report said that facts clearly show that the Korean issue can never be resolved by war, it must be resolved peacefully and autonomously by the Korean people themselves.

The report emphasized that the issue of the reunification of the fatherland is, in the final analysis, an internal issue of Korea. Therefore, solving this problem is the inherent right of the Korean people, which cannot be entrusted to others, nor can it be interfered with by anyone. The report said that the assertion that still opposes the autonomous position and subjective role of the Korean people in resolving the issue of Korean reunification is an intolerable national insult to the Korean people.

The report pointed out that as long as the Korean people firmly grasp their own destiny, jointly discuss and unify national opinion, and unite as one, no aggressor can obstruct this struggle to the end, and our fatherland will surely be unified.

However, the current rulers in South Korea are still clamoring for "north-south elections under the supervision of the United Nations." They even blatantly clamored that the South Korean system should be unilaterally expanded to North Korea. There is essentially no difference between this argument and the notorious "northward unification theory." The report revealed that this assertion is nothing but an attempt to forcibly pursue a result that is completely different from the true will of the Korean people by relying on external interference. For more than ten years, the United Nations has actually played this shameful role in South Korea. In Korea, the United Nations has always been used as a convenient tool to cover up the aggressive actions of American imperialism, and has become a belligerent party in the criminal war of aggression against the Korean people. The Korean people all clearly know how the will of the people is distorted in the "elections under the supervision of the United Nations."

The report exposed the American imperialists' misuse of the "United Nations" signboard in South Korea, and reported that the so-called "United Nations Korean Unification and Rehabilitation Commission" is just a puppet created by the American imperialists, and its purpose is to serve the American imperialist aggression policy and conceal its aggressive actions in front of the people of the world. The American imperialist tool—the "United Nations Korean Unification and Rehabilitation Commission"—must be abolished immediately, and must get out of South Korea immediately along with the American imperialist aggressive troops.

The report reiterated that our line on the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, that is, the reunification of the fatherland, must be realized by the Korean people themselves in a peaceful way on a democratic basis.

The unified government of Korea must be established through free elections throughout Korea based on democratic principles without any external interference. This is our firm and unwavering basic principle for solving the Korean issue.

The report emphasized that in order to achieve autonomous and peaceful reunification, all foreign troops must first withdraw from Korea. The American troops' occupation of South Korea is the biggest obstacle in the way of unifying the fatherland and the root cause of the serious disasters suffered by the South Korean people. The American imperialist aggressive troops must immediately withdraw from South Korea.

If all foreign troops withdraw from South Korea, then the Korean people will solve the problem of unifying the fatherland well with their own strength without delay. To this end, the freedom of all political activities must first be thoroughly guaranteed throughout the entire region of North and South Korea. Needless to say, freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association must be guaranteed. All political parties and social groups, no matter what class interests they represent or what political views they hold, must be given complete freedom of political activity. And they can freely carry out activities in any region, whether north or south. Only in this way can all the people of North and South Korea realize what kind of political beliefs and policies are in line with their interests, and freely choose the most superior social system for the happiness and development of the fatherland and the nation.

Therefore, we will guarantee conditions for political parties, social groups, and individual social activists in South Korea so that they can freely conduct political activities in any region of North Korea. Regardless of what political views they are propagating.

In order to fully reflect the practical will of the people of all strata in the upcoming North-South Korean general elections, it is also necessary to ensure that all citizens can fully exercise their democratic rights and not be infringed upon. The North-South general elections must be universal, equal, and genuinely democratic elections. All bad behaviors that endanger fair elections must be thoroughly opposed, and secret voting must be strictly guaranteed. Only through elections held under these conditions can the Korean people fully express their true will, and the all-Korean unified government established in this way can become the most thorough embodiment of the aspirations and national interests of all the Korean people.

The report said that today, the northern half of our country is showing a thriving new life under the banner of communism. The people of the northern half have long accepted communist ideas from their hearts. If they ignore this solemn reality and continue to adhere to anti-communism, then who are they going to solve the national reunification issue with?

The report further stated that if the South Korean authorities are still unable to agree to holding free North-South general elections because of fear, then even transitional measures should be taken to solve the most urgent national tasks at present. Even if complete national reunification cannot be realized, all efforts should be made to maintain and strengthen the national ties and connections between the divided North and South. This is our lofty obligation.

The report pointed out that, as Premier Kim Il-sung has already proposed, we propose implementing a federal system between North and South Korea. The federal system we propose should be implemented in this way: temporarily maintain the existing political systems in North and South Korea as they are, and maintain the independent activities of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the same time, the Highest National Committee, composed of representatives of the two governments, will be primarily responsible for uniformly adjusting the economic and cultural development of North and South Korea.

The Highest National Committee should be composed of an equal number of representatives appointed by the two governments, and representatives from both sides will have equal powers. This will be: a reasonable measure to solve the problem without causing any loss to either party under the conditions that North and South Korea maintain different political systems and continue the independent activities of the two governments. As for what tasks the federal system will bear and what role it will play, it must of course be specifically stipulated by both parties through agreement.

We believe that the implementation of the federal system will mainly be to uniformly adjust and develop the economic and cultural life of North and South Korea. The Highest National Committee can represent the entire Korea and carry out foreign activities; it can also take common measures to unite the strength of all the people of North and South Korea, oppose foreign aggression, and defend the security of the fatherland and the nation. As long as the North and South work together, these suggestions of ours can be realized.

The report said that we will carefully consider any constructive opinions put forward regarding the implementation of the federal system, no matter what they are. Our suggestion to implement a federal system is based on a full assessment of the objective reality formed in the country and starts from the sincere desire to break the existing stalemate between the North and South.

The report pointed out that if the South Korean authorities cannot even accept the implementation of a federal system, we once again suggest that a purely economic committee should be organized by representatives of the business circles of North and South Korea, without involving political issues, so that even if it is only a matter of economic cooperation and exchanges, it should be resolved quickly.

The report said that after liberation, our people, following the path pointed out by the Korean Workers' Party, not only established the most advanced society without oppression and exploitation in the northern half, but also established a powerful heavy industrial base with their selfless labor and laid the foundation for an independent national economy.

Due to the priority development of heavy industry, we have established a light industry base in a short period of time, set off a great upsurge in agricultural production, and raised the living standards of all working people to the level they are today.

Because we have an independent national economic foundation, as long as we are determined, we can build any large-scale factory at any time, establish new departments at any time, and have the prospect of realizing that the northern half will be built into a paradise of happiness for the people in the near future.

However, we are not only building a socialist foundation in the northern half for the people of the northern half to eat well, dress well, and live a happy life.

The more the people in the northern half feel that their lives are becoming happier and richer, the more actively they will play a highly creative enthusiasm in production and construction to save the compatriots in the southern half who are in misery, and they warmly hope that the brothers and sisters in the southern half can also share the fruits of their labor.

The report said that this shows how necessary and urgent the mature requirements for economic and cultural cooperation and exchanges between the North and South are.

The establishment of the Highest National Committee based on the implementation of the federal system, or the establishment of an economic committee composed of representatives of the business circles of North and South Korea, will pave the way for such economic cooperation and exchanges.

The report pointed out that today, the issue of reducing the military strength of North and South Korea to a minimum is of particularly important significance in restoring normal relations between the North and South. The military strength of North and South Korea is enough to perform the task of defending the nation. Now, South Korea has more than 600,000 troops. This can only lead to excessive military expenses burdening the masses of the people. Therefore, we continue to advocate that the military strength of North and South Korea should be reduced to 100,000 or less respectively. If the US military is withdrawn and the armies of North and South Korea are reduced in this way, then the tense situation in Korea will be significantly eased, and a big step forward will be made in consolidating peace.

The report said that in order to solve the urgent national tasks, we once again suggest to the South Korean authorities, all political parties, social organizations, people from all walks of life, and all the people of South Korea, to quickly convene a consultative meeting between North and South Korea in Panmunjom, Pyongyang, or Seoul. The Korean people will surely realize the peaceful reunification of their fatherland with their own strength.

The report finally said that we are convinced that the peace-loving people of the world will resolutely support this legitimate demand of the Korean people and will fight with us for its realization.

The report firmly believes that the day will surely come when foreign imperialist aggressors are driven out of our beloved homeland, and a prosperous and free paradise for the people is established on the beautiful three thousand ri of picturesque rivers and mountains passed down by our ancestors, and thirty million compatriots live a happy and harmonious life like a family.

    崔庸健在最高人民会议八次会议上作报告
    朝鲜人民必将用自己力量和平统一祖国
    和平统一祖国是朝鲜人民的内政决不容许任何外人干涉  朝鲜人民团结一致就能把美帝国主义者从南朝鲜赶出去
    新华社平壤20日电　朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长崔庸健19日下午在朝鲜最高人民会议第二届第八次会议上作了“关于进一步促进祖国的和平统一”的报告。
    报告首先指出，实现祖国的和平统一，这是目前朝鲜人民最大的愿望，是民族的至高无上的任务。
    报告说，金日成首相在八·一五朝鲜解放十五周年庆祝大会上的报告中，再度阐明朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对国家统一问题的坚定立场和关于和平统一的基本原则，并提出了新的方案。这再一次证实了，始终不懈地为国家的和平统一而斗争的朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的真诚努力。金日成首相的这一方案是以对目前国内外形势的正确分析为基础的、极其现实而合理的途径。这一方案在国内国外引起了巨大的反应，受到绝对的支持和赞同，在南朝鲜各阶级人民也广泛地引起了共鸣。在南朝鲜人民中主张统一问题必须由朝鲜人民用自己的主观力量来解决的呼声越来越高。
    目前，南朝鲜人民要实现统一的热情空前高涨，他们表现出要用自己的力量来实现这一伟大事业的高度的积极性。
    报告接着指出，南朝鲜人民展开这样积极的斗争，绝不是偶然的。国土的分裂所造成的严重后果，正在越来越明显地表现在南朝鲜整个社会经济生活中。南朝鲜人民再也不愿生活在目前这样的环境里，同时也绝不能这样活下去。南朝鲜的民族经济已经全面破产和没落。在经济生活中理应成为主导部门的民族产业，原来就很薄弱，现在更加衰退。南朝鲜农村仍然持续着封建剥削关系，农民经济更加赤贫化，农业生产更加降低了。在南朝鲜经济中，工业各部门之间和工农业之间的有机联系已被截断，殖民地畸形状态更加加深，使人们无法设想经济的自主发展。今天南朝鲜的经济情况已经陷入比日本帝国主义的黑暗统治时期更加惨酷的殖民地景况。南朝鲜人民再也不能忍受十五年来的殖民统治所招致的这一切社会罪恶和极度苦难的生活，今年4月终于奋起展开了反对压迫者的英雄的斗争。
    报告指出，在李承晚逆贼被驱逐后已经过了半年的今天，事态丝毫没有改变，反而一直在恶化。尽管南朝鲜现“政府”鉴于人民的革命气势而提出种种虚伪的口号，人民的生活是越来越深陷于水深火热之中了。
    报告强调说，事实证明，南朝鲜现在的政权本质上同李承晚“政府”没有任何区别，南朝鲜各界人民通过自己的实际生活吸取了教训，并且更加广泛地走上了新的斗争道路。
    报告接着指出，今天，消除在南朝鲜形成的毁灭性危机和拯救处于水深火热之中的人民生活的唯一出路，就是实现祖国的和平统一，依靠北半部强大的经济力量。这是现实的迫切要求，是再也不可拖延的崇高的民族义务。报告说，由于霸占着南朝鲜的美国侵略势力的干涉和它的忠实奴仆的顽固阻挠，国家的统一还没有实现。解放后十五年的历史，充满着在统一朝鲜的问题上这两条相反的路线的尖锐斗争。报告接着以大量的历史事实令人信服地说明了这一点。
    报告指出，十多年来，南朝鲜当局所做的事，只有一个。那就是他们像梦呓般地反复叫喊“北进统一”。这受到了朝鲜人民的一致反对和世界舆论的严厉谴责。报告说，事实清楚地表明，朝鲜问题用战争的方法是决不能解决的，它必须以和平的方法，并且由朝鲜人民自己自主地解决。
    报告强调说，祖国的统一问题，归根到底是朝鲜的内部问题。因此，解决这个问题，是朝鲜人民固有的权利，不能委托给别人，也决不能受到任何人的干涉。报告说，仍然在解决朝鲜统一问题方面反对朝鲜人民自主的立场和主观作用的那种主张，是对朝鲜人民的不可容忍的民族侮辱。
    报告指出，只要是朝鲜人民自己紧紧地掌握自己的命运，共同商讨，统一国论，并且团结一致，那么任何侵略者也不可能把这种斗争阻挠到底，而我们祖国是一定会得到统一的。
    但是，南朝鲜的目前执政者们，现在也仍然叫嚷“联合国监督下的南北选举”。他们甚至公然叫嚣应把南朝鲜的制度片面地扩张到北朝鲜。这种论调和臭名远扬的“北进统一论”，本质上根本没有什么差异。报告揭露说，这种主张并不是别的，只是要依靠外部势力的干涉来强行追求与朝鲜人民真正的意志截然不同的结果的企图。过去十多年来，联合国在南朝鲜实际上起了这种可耻的作用。在朝鲜，联合国一向被利用为掩盖美帝国主义侵略行为的便利的工具，并且成了为反对朝鲜人民而进行的罪恶的侵略战争的交战一方。朝鲜人民都清楚地知道，在“联合国监督下的选举”中，人民的意志是怎样被歪曲的。
    报告揭露了美帝国主义者在南朝鲜盗用“联合国”的招牌，报告说，所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”只不过是美帝国主义者一手制造的傀儡，它的目的便是为美帝国主义侵略政策服务，并且在全世界人民面前掩蔽它的侵略行为。美帝国主义的侵略工具——“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”，必须立即撤销，必须同美帝国主义侵略军队一起，立刻滚出南朝鲜去。
    报告再次表示，我们关于和平统一祖国的路线，即祖国的统一，必须由朝鲜人民自己在民主基础上以和平的方法实现。
    朝鲜的统一政府必须在不受任何外部干涉的条件下通过以民主原则为基础的全朝鲜的自由选举建立起来，这是我们为解决朝鲜问题而采取的坚定不移的基本原则。
    报告强调说，为了自主的和平统一，首先要使一切外国军队撤出朝鲜。美国军队的强占南朝鲜，是横在统一祖国的途径上的最大的障碍，是使南朝鲜人民遭受严重灾难的祸根。美帝国主义侵略军必须立即撤出南朝鲜。
    如果一切外国军队从南朝鲜撤走，那么朝鲜人民将毫不迟延地以自己力量很好地解决统一祖国的问题。为此，首先要在南北朝鲜的整个地区内彻底保障一切政治活动的自由。不用说，言论、出版、集会及结社的自由必须得到保障，所有政党、社会团体不管它是代表什么阶层的利益，抱有什么政治见解，都必须得到政治活动的完全自由。并且无论在南北任何地区都能自由进行活动。只有这样做，南北朝鲜的全体人民才能认识到什么样的政治信念和政策符合自己的利益，才能自由地选择为祖国和民族的幸福和发展的最优越的社会制度。
    因此，我们将为南朝鲜的政党、社会团体和个别的社会活动家保证条件，使他们能够在北朝鲜任何地区自由地进行政治活动。不管他们是宣传什么样的政治见解。
    为了使各阶层人民的切实的意志在今后举行的南北朝鲜总选举中充分得到反映，还要保证全体公民能够完全行使民主权利，不让它受到侵犯。南北总选举必须是普遍的、平等的真正的民主选举。必须彻底反对危害公正选举的一切不良的行为，严格保证秘密投票。朝鲜人民只有通过在这种条件下举行的选举，才能完全表示自己的真正意志，这样所建立的全朝鲜统一政府才能成为最彻底的体现了全体朝鲜人民的志向和民族利益的民主政府。
    报告说，今天我国北半部在共产主义旗帜下，展现出欣欣向荣的新生活。北半部人民早已从自己的心里接受了共产主义思想。如果忽视这一严正现实，继续坚持反共，那么他们到底是要跟谁解决国家的统一问题呢。
    报告进一步说，南朝鲜当局如果因为畏惧而尚不能同意举行自由的南北总选举，那么也应该采取那怕是过渡性的措施，以解决当前最迫切的民族任务。即使不能实现完全的国家统一，也应该尽一切力量维持和加强分裂的南北之间的民族纽带和联系。这是我们崇高的义务。
    报告指出，正如金日成首相已经提出的，我们建议实行南北朝鲜的联邦制。我们所建议的联邦制，要用这种方法来实行：暂时照旧保持南北朝鲜的现有政治制度，并且保持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和大韩民国政府的独自活动，同时，由两个政府的代表组成最高民族委员会，主要的统一调节南北朝鲜的经济文化的发展。
    最高民族委员会要由两个政府的任命同样名额的代表构成，双方代表将有同等权限。这将成为：在南北朝鲜保持不同政治制度，持续两个政府的独自活动的条件下，不使任何一方遭到任何损失而能解决问题的合理措施。至于联邦制将负有什么样的任务，起什么样的作用问题，当然要双方协议具体地加以规定。
    我们认为联邦制的实行，将主要地是统一调整和发展南北朝鲜的经济及文化生活。最高民族委员会可以代表全朝鲜，进行对外活动；也可以采取共同的措施，把南北朝鲜全体人民的力量联合起来，反对外来侵略，保卫祖国和民族的安全。只要是南北共同努力，我们的这些建议都是可以实现的。
    报告说，只要是有关于联邦制的实行所提出的建设性意见，不管是什么样的，我们都将慎重考虑。我们要实行联邦制的建议，是充分估计到国家所形成的客观现实，从要打开现有南北僵局的真诚愿望出发的。
    报告指出，假如南朝鲜当局如果连联邦制的实行还不能接受的话，我们再次建议：要由南北朝鲜实业界代表组织纯粹的经济委员会，不牵涉政治问题，那管只是经济合作和交流问题，也要急速解决。
    报告说，解放后，我们人民沿着朝鲜劳动党指出的道路，在北半部不仅建立了没有压迫和剥削的最先进的社会，而且以自己的忘我劳动建立了强大的重工业基地，奠定了自主的民族经济基础。
    由于优先发展了重工业，我们在短时期内建立了轻工业基地，掀起了农业生产的大高潮，并且把全体劳动人民的生活水平提高到像今天这样的水平。
    由于我们有了自主的民族经济基础，只要我们下决心就随时可以建设任何大规模的工厂，随时可以建立新的部门、并且有了可以实现的前景：在最近将来把北半部建设成为人民的幸福乐园。
    但是我们并不是只为了北半部人民吃好、穿好、过好美满生活而在北半部建立社会主义基础的。
    北半部人民越感到自己的生活日益幸福和富裕，他们也就越积极地为拯救处于水深火热中的南半部同胞，而在生产和建设中发挥高度的创造热情，并热烈希望南半部兄弟姐妹们也能够分享他们的劳动果实。
    报告说，这说明：实现南北之间的经济文化合作和交流是多么必要的和刻不容缓的成熟的要求。
    根据联邦制的实行成立最高民族委员会，或由南北朝鲜实业界代表组成经济委员会，将为这种经济合作和交流开辟道路。
    报告指出，今天，把南北朝鲜的兵力裁减到最低限度的问题，在恢复南北之间的正常关系方面具有特别重要的意义。南北朝鲜的兵力，能够执行保卫民族的任务就够了。现在，南朝鲜拥有六十多万的兵力。这只能招致使人民群众负担过重的军费。因此，我们继续主张：南北朝鲜的兵力应该分别裁减到十万或十万以下。如果使美军撤走，并且这样裁减南北朝鲜的军队，那末朝鲜的紧张局势就会有显著的缓和，在巩固和平方面也就大大前进了一步。
    报告说，为了解决紧急的民族任务，我们向南朝鲜当局、各政党、社会团体，各界人士及全体南朝鲜人民再次建议，在板门店、平壤或汉城迅速召开南北朝鲜之间的协商会议。朝鲜人民必将用自己的力量来实现自己祖国的和平统一。
    报告最后说，我们确信：全世界爱好和平人民一定会坚决支持朝鲜人民的这一正当要求，并将和我们一道为它的实现而斗争。
    报告坚信，这样的日子是一定会到来的：把外来帝国主义侵略者从我们可爱的祖国疆土赶出去，在祖先传留给我们的美丽的三千里锦绣江山上，建立起富强自由的人民乐园，三千万同胞像一家人一样欢度和睦生活。
