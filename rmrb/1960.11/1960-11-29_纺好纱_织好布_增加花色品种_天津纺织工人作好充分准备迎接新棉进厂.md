Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 28th: Tianjin's eight major cotton textile factories are seizing the excellent opportunity of the new cotton entering the factory to strive to increase the production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth and improve the quality of yarn and cloth. Since October, the city's output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has increased week by week, and the quality has also improved significantly. In the first half of November, the first-grade rate of high-quality cotton yarn increased from 95.6% in October to 97.27%; the first-grade rate of cotton cloth entering the warehouse increased from 94.47% to 97.63%.

Recently, a large batch of new cotton is being successively transported to Tianjin from various places. This new cotton is white in color and has long fibers, which creates conditions for various textile factories to increase varieties and improve quality. At present, while the output and quality of various cotton textile factories are improving, the variety of products has also greatly increased. There are as many as forty-two kinds of cotton yarn produced by various factories. Among them, there is yarn for making velvet clothes, yarn for weaving high-grade fabrics such as corduroy and gabardine, and eighty-count plied yarn for the production of high-grade poplin. In addition, in order to meet the requirements of building rubber-wheeled handcarts for agricultural use, they have also produced a large number of cotton yarns for weaving rubber tire fabrics. In addition to popular commodities such as gabardine and woolen cloth, the cotton cloth produced by various factories also includes some high-grade poplin and rayon. In order to meet the increasing demand of consumers for corduroy, the No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory has decided to convert some of its looms into looms specifically for weaving corduroy in the fourth quarter.

The production tasks of Tianjin's cotton textile factories in the fourth quarter are very heavy. In order to spin the new cotton transported from various places into more and better cotton yarn and cotton cloth, as early as the end of the third quarter, the workers of each factory planned to address the problems of insufficient equipment and manpower for increasing yarn and cloth production in their factories and launched a vigorous "one person doing the work of several" campaign. The maintenance workers in the roving workshop of the No. 4 State-owned Cotton Factory formed a high-speed commando team and adopted twenty-five technical measures on more than one hundred roving frames to ensure increased machine speed without producing waste, which generally increased the speed of the roving frames by 10% to 20%. The doffers, maintenance workers, and technicians of the spinning mill of the No. 5 State-owned Cotton Factory jointly improved the equipment, which significantly reduced yarn breakage during doffing and greatly shortened the doffing time. In order to overcome the problem of insufficient labor, the workers of each factory are vying to expand the number of machines they watch over. The roving frame operators of the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Factory have generally achieved three people doing the work of four or four people doing the work of five. The famous "Clever Weaver" Sun Guizhen has increased from watching ten looms to fourteen looms and has created advanced operating methods of finding the broken ends and piecing them together in one go, further shortening the piecing time.

### 纺好纱　织好布　增加花色品种  天津纺织工人作好充分准备迎接新棉进厂

    纺好纱　织好布　增加花色品种
    天津纺织工人作好充分准备迎接新棉进厂
    新华社天津28日电　天津市八大棉纺织厂职工乘新棉进厂的大好时机，努力增产棉纱棉布，提高纱布的质量。10月份以来，全市棉纱和棉布产量逐旬上升，质量也有显著提高。11月上中旬的上等棉纱的一级品率已由10月份的95.6％提高到97.27％；棉布入库的一等品率由94.47％提高到97.63％。
    最近各地正将大批新棉陆续运往天津。这些新棉色泽白纤维长，为各纺织厂增加品种、提高质量创造了条件。目前，各棉纺织厂在产量质量提高的同时，产品的品种也大大增加。各厂生产的棉纱共有四十二种之多。其中有做绒衣用的纱，有织灯芯绒、华达呢等高档布用的纱，有供生产高级府绸用的八十支合股纱。此外，为适应大造农业用胶轮手推车的要求，他们还生产了大批织胶轮帘子布用的棉纱。各厂生产的棉布除华达呢、线呢等当令商品外，还生产出一些高级府绸和人造棉绸等。为了适应广大消费者对灯芯绒的需要量日益增多的情况，国棉一厂已决定在第四季度内把一部分布机改装成专门织灯芯绒的布机。
    天津市各棉纺织厂第四季度的生产任务很大。为了把各地运来的新棉纺织成又多又好的棉纱棉布，早在第三季度末，各厂职工就计划对本厂增产纱和布存在的设备、人力等不足问题，大闹“一顶几”运动。国棉四厂细纱车间的保全工人组成了高速突击队，在一百多台细纱机上采取了二十五项保证提高机器转数不出废花的技术措施，使细纱机车速普遍提高了10％到20％。国棉五厂纺纱厂的落纱工、保全工和技术人员共同改进设备，使落纱断头显著减少，落纱时间大大缩短。为了克服劳动力不足的问题，各厂工人争先扩大看机台数。国棉三厂的细纱挡车工已经普遍做到三人顶四人或四人顶五人。著名的“巧织女”孙桂珍，已由看十台织布机增加到十四台，并创造了一次找头、一次掏头的先进操作法，进一步缩短了掏头时间。（附图片）
