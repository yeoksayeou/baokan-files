    Supporting Agricultural Production at the Grassroots Level; Organizing Mass Life Among the Masses
    Finance and Trade Cadres of Matou Commune Implement a Stationing System
    Grain Production is Promoted, Canteen Work is Improved, and Finance and Trade Tasks are also Successfully Completed
    (Our Tianjin Dispatch, November 2nd) In Matou Commune, Wuqing County, Hebei Province, the finance and trade departments have implemented a system of stationing cadres in production teams. 51% of the total number of finance and trade cadres in the commune have been sent to settle in production teams. They participate in production to support it, assist in organizing the economic life of the masses, and complete finance and trade work tasks simultaneously.
    After the finance and trade cadres are stationed in the teams, they are led by both the finance and trade departments and the local Party organizations. They eat, live, work, and consult with the masses, and promote grain production in the following ways:
    1.  Delve into the realities of production, understand production, grasp the laws of production, and better serve production. The stationed cadres participate in production labor, participate in production planning and daily production management, and regularly grasp the production situation and the production team's needs for production materials. They then make supply plans, ensuring timely and accurate supply to meet the needs of agricultural production. Since the beginning of this year, the commune leadership has led commune members to carry out ten major production campaigns such as drought resistance and rush planting. Before each campaign began, the stationed cadres reported to the shops in advance to organize various forces to support them in a timely manner.
    2.  Help production teams to vigorously carry out tool reforms, tap the potential of labor, and strengthen the front line of production. After the stationed cadres discovered, from participating in production practice, that non-field operations occupied too much labor, they concentrated a large amount of effort to help production teams vigorously carry out reforms in rice and flour feed processing, field tools, and cooking tools. As a result, the commune freed up more than 13,000 people from the original 17,700+ logistics personnel to participate in grain production. At the same time, the stationed cadres also tried to participate in field labor as much as possible. According to statistics, in four months, they have done more than 15,000 workdays for the production teams.
    3.  Go deep into the fields, help production teams sum up and promote advanced experiences, and find ways to increase grain production. In the past, the commune members of this commune were not accustomed to intercropping beans in sweet potato ridges. This year, the stationed cadres helped all production teams in the commune to universally promote the experience of intercropping early-maturing mung beans and red beans in sweet potato ridges, with a total of more than 10,000 mu of intercropping.
    4.  Help production teams vigorously develop pig raising. At present, the number of pigs raised in the commune has increased by more than 30% compared with last year, which has increased the source of fertilizer for agriculture and opened up a commodity base for the finance and trade departments.
    While fully supporting production, the finance and trade cadres stationed in the teams in Matou Commune have not relaxed their finance and trade work. For example, during the preparation for summer vegetable sowing, the stationed cadres learned in their labor that some commune members had vegetable seeds, but some teams lacked vegetable seeds and could not complete the task of growing vegetables. After timely organization of purchases, more than 7,000 jin were transferred successively, enabling the whole commune to grow more than 5,000 mu of vegetables. In order to better complete the task of purchasing various agricultural and sideline products, with the support of the commune Party committee, the finance and trade cadres promoted "Patriotic Sales Days" throughout the commune, that is, every ten days or so, the commune members would gather the fat pigs, fresh eggs and other agricultural and sideline products to be sold and hand them over to the finance and trade departments (they can also be sold on weekdays). This not only meets the selling requirements of the masses, but also greatly improves the efficiency of the purchasing work.
    After the finance and trade cadres were stationed in the teams, they assisted in arranging the lives of the commune members, focusing on grain and canteens. They helped the canteens arrange their grain usage plans and improved the grain management system. Fifty-six stationed cadres also went to these canteens to be managers, helping these canteens increase the variety of food, improve the quality of service and management level. Recently, the stationed cadres have also helped the canteens use idle land to grow vegetables, raise pigs, and raise chickens to further improve the lives of the commune members.

    到基层中支援农业生产　到群众中组织群众生活
    码头公社财贸干部实行驻队制
    促进了粮食增产，改进了食堂工作，财贸任务也完成得好
    本报天津2日电　河北省武清县码头公社财贸部门推行干部驻队制度，已经派出占全社财贸干部总数51％的人到生产队安家落户，一面参加生产支持生产，一面协助组织群众经济生活，同时完成财贸工作任务。
    财贸干部驻队后，既受财贸部门领导，又受当地党组织领导。他们和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，并且从以下几方面促进粮食增产：
    一、深入生产实际，了解生产，掌握生产规律，更好地为生产服务。驻队干部参加生产劳动，参与生产规划和日常生产管理工作，经常掌握生产情况和生产队对生产资料的需要情况，然后作出供应计划，做到供应及时、准确，紧紧跟上农业生产的需要。今年以来，公社领导社员开展抗旱、抢种等十大生产运动，每次运动开始以前，驻队干部都事先向商店汇报，及时组织各方面的力量支援。
    二、帮助生产队大搞工具改革，挖掘劳动力潜力，加强生产第一线。驻队干部从参加生产实践中发现生产队非田间作业占用劳力过多的问题以后，就集中较大力量帮助生产队大搞米面饲料加工、田间工具和炊事工具改革，结果，使公社从原有一万七千七百多名后勤人员中，腾出一万三千多人，参加了粮食生产。在这同时，驻队干部还尽量参加田间劳动。据统计，四个月当中，他们共为生产队做了一万五千多个劳动日。
    三、深入田间，帮助生产队总结和推广先进经验，寻找增产粮食的门路。这个公社的社员过去不习惯在红薯垅里间种豆类，今年驻队干部帮助全社各生产队普遍推广了红薯垅里间种早熟绿豆、红小豆的增产经验，总共间种了一万多亩。
    四、帮助生产队大力发展养猪事业。到目前，公社养猪头数已比去年增加30％以上，既为农业增加了肥料来源，又为财贸部门开辟了商品基地。
    码头公社财贸干部驻队干部在全力支持生产的同时，也没有放松财贸工作。例如，在夏菜播种准备期间，驻队干部在劳动中了解到有的社员存有菜籽，但有的队因缺乏菜籽，完不成种菜任务，经过及时组织收购，先后调剂了七千多斤，使全社多种蔬菜五千多亩。为了更好地完成各项农副产品收购任务，在公社党委的支持下，财贸干部在全社推行了“爱国交售日”，就是每过十天左右，由社员把交售的肥猪、鲜蛋等各种农副产品集中起来，交售给财贸部门（平日也可以交售）。这样做不仅符合群众的出售要求，而且也大大提高了收购工作效率。
    财贸干部驻队以后，以粮食为中心，以食堂为重点，协助安排好社员生活。他们帮助各食堂安排好用粮计划，健全了粮食管理制度。有五十六名驻队干部还到这些食堂去当管理员，帮助这些食堂增加饭菜花样，提高服务质量和经营管理水平。最近驻队干部又帮助食堂利用闲散土地种菜、养猪、养鸡，进一步改善社员生活。
