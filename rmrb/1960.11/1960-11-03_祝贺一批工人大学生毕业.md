    Congratulations to a Batch of Worker-University Graduates
    Sun Bai
    The first batch of worker-university students from Liming Machinery Factory recently graduated from the factory-run spare-time university through the channels of part-work and part-study and spare-time learning. A batch of workers from factories in various regions will also successively graduate from spare-time universities. This is a newly emerging fighting force in the ranks of China's working-class intellectuals. This is a remarkable and good thing. It deserves our warm congratulations!
    Rapidly cultivating our own working-class intellectuals is an important guarantee for us to build socialism. The workers deeply realize that learning is the Party's further cultivation of them, and learning is the political task the Party gives them. They link participating in spare-time university studies, mastering more and better cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge with the great ambition to carry out socialist construction better and faster. With this correct ideological foundation, with this lofty learning goal, coupled with their rich practical experience in production, they are filled with courage. In the face of conquering scientific fortresses, just like overcoming key problems in production, they show unparalleled tenacious heroic spirit and firm confidence in victory. Zheng Xixiang, an old worker with thirteen years of seniority, originally only studied for five years. When he first entered the university classroom and listened to the teacher talking about chemical terms and advanced mathematics formulas, he would always learn this and forget that. However, because he understood that "learning is for the entire cause of the working class," he did not bow his head in the face of difficulties. He was determined to improve himself through hard work. If others learned something once, he would learn it three or five times, trying every possible means to overcome the difficulties in learning. In this way, he became an excellent university student. Zheng Xixiang's spirit of learning and academic achievements demonstrate the excellent qualities and intelligence of our working class.
    The fact that this batch of worker-university graduates from Liming Machinery Factory, who have rich production experience and a high degree of class consciousness, have indomitably conquered the fortresses of culture and science, not only fills us with greater confidence in the intellectualization of workers and peasants but also makes us see more clearly that once the workers and peasants break down superstitions and master cultural and scientific knowledge, they will indeed be like骏马添了双翼 [a steed given wings], and they can more fully exert their rich production experience and creativity to promote the rapid advancement of socialist construction. After they have learned cultural and scientific knowledge, the fearless spirit of the working class is also further developed. The role of this fearless spirit can be vividly seen in their graduation designs this time. They chose some more complex design tasks. Some people called this move "daring," saying "don't think too high!" However, this batch of worker-university students who have added wings in culture and science dare to "包天 [envelop the heavens]" and dare to "想得高 [think high]," completing the design tasks very well. A considerable part of the designs have reached the advanced level in our country, and they have created many technical innovation projects.
    The example of Liming Machinery Factory cultivating the first batch of worker-university graduates will surely encourage workers in various regions to strive for the first place on the road to marching towards culture and science, to study harder for the cause of the working class, and to move towards the goal of intellectualizing workers and peasants!

    祝贺一批工人大学生毕业
    孙柏
    黎明机械厂第一批工人大学生，通过半工半读和业余学习的途径，最近从厂办业余大学毕业了。各地工厂也将有一批工人陆续从业余大学毕业。这是我国工人阶级知识分子队伍中一支新生的战斗力量。这是一件了不起的好事。值得我们热烈的祝贺！
    高速度地培养工人阶级自己的知识分子，是我们建设社会主义的重要保证。工人们深深地认识到学习是党对他们进一步的培养，学习是党给他们的政治任务。他们把参加业余大学学习，更多更好地掌握文化科学技术知识，与更好更快地进行社会主义建设的雄心大志联结在一起了。有了这种正确的思想基础，有了这种崇高的学习目的，再加上他们有丰富的生产实际经验，就使他们勇气百倍，在攻取科学堡垒面前，同在攻克生产上的关键一样，表现出无比顽强的英雄气概，和坚定的胜利信心。具有十三年工龄的老工人郑锡祥原来只念过五年书，他刚走进大学课堂，听老师讲化学名词和高等数学公式，总是学这个，忘那个，但是，因为他懂得：“学习是为着工人阶级的整个事业”。因此他在困难面前，毫不低头；自己发愤图强，刻苦学习，别人一遍学会的，他就学习三遍、五遍，千方百计地克服学习中的困难，就这样，他成为一名优秀的大学生。郑锡祥的这种学习精神和学习成绩，显示了我们工人阶级的优良品质和聪明才干。
    黎明机械厂这批具有丰富生产经验和高度阶级觉悟的工人大学毕业生，百折不挠地攻取文化科学堡垒的事实，使我们不仅对工农群众知识化更加充满了胜利的信心，也使我们更加清楚地看到了工农群众一旦破除了迷信，掌握了文化科学知识，在生产中的确就如骏马添了双翼，能够更充分地发挥他们丰富的生产经验和创造能力，推动社会主义建设事业的飞速前进。他们在学得了文化科学知识以后，工人阶级大无畏的精神，也更加发扬起来了。从他们这次的毕业设计中，就可以生动地看出这种大无畏精神所起的作用。他们选择了一些比较复杂的设计任务。有人称这个举动是“胆大包天”，说是“不要想得太高吧！”但是，这批在文化科学上添了双翼的工人大学生，却敢于“包天”，敢于“想得高”，把设计任务完成得很好，有相当一部分设计达到我国的先进水平，并且创造出不少技术革新的项目。
    黎明机械厂培养第一批工人大学毕业生的榜样，必将鼓舞各地工人在向文化科学进军的道路上奋勇争先，为工人阶级的事业而更加奋发学习，向着工农群众知识化的目标迈进！
