Title: Korean Government Issues Memorandum Condemning the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea's" Clamor; American Imperialism is the Culprit Obstructing Korean Unification; UN General Assembly's Unilateral Discussion of the Korean Issue is a Gross Violation of the Korean People's Right to Self-Determination; Resolving the Korean Issue Requires Forcing the American Aggressor Troops Misusing the UN Banner to Withdraw from South Korea

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 11th: The Korean Central News Agency reported on the 11th that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a memorandum on the peaceful unification of Korea on the 11th, refuting the tenth "annual report" and its "supplementary report" submitted to the 15th UN General Assembly by the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea."

The memorandum pointed out that these documents of the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," like its past "reports," aim to conceal the American policy of aggression towards Korea, to suit the American demands for obstructing the peaceful unification of Korea, to distort the grave reality created in Korea, and to deceive just public opinion.

The memorandum stated that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea considers it necessary to clearly state the actual situation in Korea and to reiterate the reasonable path to resolving the Korean issue.

The memorandum first refuted the absurd claim of the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" that the fact that Korea has not yet been unified is due to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's refusal to accept "United Nations resolutions." The memorandum stated that all historical facts prove that the reason why Korea cannot be unified lies in the American troops' occupation of South Korea and the American policy of aggression towards Korea.

The memorandum then exposed the consistent American policy of turning Korea into its colony and a military base for its aggression against the Asian continent. The memorandum said that under American coercion, the Korean issue is placed on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly every year, and it is unilaterally discussed without the participation of its party concerned—the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The mechanical passage of "resolutions" prefabricated by the United States, which completely violate the interests of the Korean people, is a gross violation of the Korean people's right to self-determination.

The memorandum described the consistent and sincere efforts made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to achieve the peaceful unification of the country as soon as possible. The memorandum pointed out that on February 5, 1958, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue by the Korean people themselves. By October 1958, the Chinese People's Volunteers had completely and voluntarily withdrawn from Korea. However, the American troops of aggression in Korea have not yet withdrawn from South Korea. The United States and the South Korean ruling clique have not only rejected all reasonable proposals put forward by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful unification of Korea, but have also further strengthened the conspiracy to prepare for war in South Korea.

The memorandum pointed out that, contrary to the "Committee's" "report," the United States has consistently and rudely trampled on the Korean Armistice Agreement. It unilaterally abolished the most important clause "Mao" in Article 13, which prohibits the reinforcement of combat materials, illegally transported various new types of weapons, such as atomic weapons and rocket weapons, into South Korea, and expanded the South Korean army to twice its size at the time of the armistice. Recently, while equipping these troops with atomic weapons, it has also continuously conducted various military provocations, such as atomic warfare exercises, on the military demarcation line. From the armistice in 1953 to the end of September this year, the number of incidents in which the United States violated the Armistice Agreement, which were formally brought up for discussion alone, reached 915. The memorandum emphasized that the fact is that, despite the consistent efforts made by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful unification of Korea, Korea has not yet been unified, which is entirely due to the American policy of aggression towards Korea and the American troops' occupation of South Korea.

The memorandum pointed out that the "Committee's" "report" insisted that everything in South Korea has become increasingly satisfactory since the downfall of the Syngman Rhee regime, and that the South Korean economy has entered a "stage of development and growth." While exposing this utter lie, the memorandum stated that the Chang Myon cabinet is merely a replica of the Syngman Rhee government. Like Syngman Rhee, Chang Myon followed the American policy of aggression, rejected the people's democratic demands, and rejected the Korean people's unanimous desire for the peaceful unification of the fatherland. At present, South Korea's national economy has completely collapsed, the number of factories has been reduced by half compared to the period of Japanese imperialist rule, and closed and semi-closed factories account for 75% of all factories; the sown area of farmland has been reduced by 600,000 chongbo, turning South Korea, which exported millions of seok (one seok equals 150 kilograms) of grain every year before liberation, into a chronically hungry zone that has to import millions of seok of foreign grain every year. Due to economic collapse and intensified plunder, the vast people of South Korea are groaning in extremely miserable lives.

The memorandum exposed the hypocrisy of the clichés of "elections under United Nations supervision" that the "Committee's" report has once again advocated. The memorandum pointed out that the so-called "elections under United Nations supervision" are merely a means of creating and maintaining American colonial rule institutions and interfering in Korean internal affairs. In particular, the United Nations is, in fact, a belligerent party on the Korean battlefield, and the Korean people can never accept "elections under United Nations supervision."

The memorandum then stated that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea advocates that the issue of the peaceful unification of Korea must be resolved in an autonomous manner, without any foreign interference, on a democratic basis, by implementing free North-South general elections. This is the only reasonable and realistic solution that can peacefully unify Korea. The United States and the South Korean ruling clique refuse this plan and continue to clamor for "anti-communist unification," which is for the permanent division of Korea.

The memorandum reiterated the new plan for the peaceful unification of Korea proposed by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the eve of the 15th anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation: As a transitional measure, implement a North-South Korean federal system; if the South Korean authorities cannot immediately accept the federal system, then a purely economic committee composed of representatives of the business community from North and South Korea can also be organized to carry out material trade between the North and South, and to assist and cooperate in economic construction; at the same time, widely implement exchanges in science, culture, art, and sports, and implement free exchanges between people, and first implement letter exchanges.

The memorandum also mentioned that the new plan includes the continued advocacy by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of forcing the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and reducing the troops of North and South Korea to 100,000 or less; in order to solve the above-mentioned urgent problems, representatives from North and South Korea should conduct consultations in Pyongyang, Seoul, or Panmunjom.

The memorandum emphasized that the Korean issue can only be resolved by the Korean people themselves, and that the United Nations or any other organization or country should not hinder the resolution of this issue.

The memorandum concluded by saying that the culprit that hinders the Korean people's national desire for the peaceful unification of Korea and plunges South Korea into such a bankrupt situation as it is today is the American imperialists who occupy South Korea. For the resolution of the Korean issue and the peaceful unification of Korea, the American imperialists must withdraw from South Korea. The United Nations should take swift measures to force the American troops misusing the UN banner and occupying South Korea to withdraw immediately, and the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," which is being used by the United States as a tool to implement the American policy of aggression, must be dissolved.

    朝鲜政府发表备忘录斥“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”的叫嚣
    美帝国主义是阻挠朝鲜统一的祸首
    联合国大会单方面讨论朝鲜问题是对朝鲜人民自主权利的粗暴侵犯
    解决朝鲜问题必须迫使盗用联合国招牌的美国侵略军撤出朝鲜南部
    新华社平壤11日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社11日讯，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府11日发表关于朝鲜和平统一的备忘录，驳斥“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”向第十五届联大提交的第十次“年度报告”及其
  “补充报告”。
    备忘录指出，“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”的这些文件，同它过去的“报告”一样，其目的在于隐蔽美国对朝鲜的侵略政策，适应美国阻挠朝鲜和平统一的要求，歪曲在朝鲜造成的严重现实，欺骗公正的社会舆论。
    备忘录说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，有必要明确说明朝鲜的实际情况，再次阐明朝鲜问题的合理解决的途径。
    备忘录首先驳斥了“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”企图把朝鲜至今尚未统一说成是由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国不接受“联合国的决议”的荒唐无稽之谈。备忘录说，一切历史事实证明，朝鲜还不能统一的原因正在于美国军队强占南朝鲜，以及美国对朝鲜的侵略政策。
    备忘录接着揭露了美国一贯实行使朝鲜变为它的殖民地，变为它侵略亚洲大陆的军事基地的政策。备忘录说，在美国的强制下，朝鲜问题每年都列入联合国大会议程，在没有它的当事人——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表的参加下，单方面进行讨论，机械地通过美国预先制造的完全违背朝鲜人民利益的
  “决议案”，这是对朝鲜人民自主权利的粗暴的侵犯。
    备忘录叙述了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国为尽快实现国家的和平统一所作的始终一贯的具有诚意的努力。备忘录指出，1958年2月5日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府发表了关于撤出一切外国军队、朝鲜问题由朝鲜人民自己和平解决的声明。截至1958年10月，中国人民志愿军已经全部主动撤离朝鲜。但是，美国的侵朝军队至今还没有从朝鲜南部撤走。美国和南朝鲜统治集团对于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为和平统一朝鲜而提出的一切合理建议，不仅全部加以拒绝，而且还在朝鲜南部进一步加强准备战争的阴谋。
    备忘录指出，同“委员会”的
  “报告”完全相反，美国一贯粗暴地蹂躏了朝鲜停战协定。它单方面废除了禁止增援作战物资的最重要的第十三款“卯”项的规定，非法地把原子武器和火箭武器等各种新型武器运进朝鲜南部，把南朝鲜军队扩大为停战时的二倍。近来，它一面用原子武器装备这些军队，一面又不断地在军事分界线进行原子战争演习等各种军事挑衅活动。从1953年停战后到今年9月底止，仅正式被提出讨论的美国方面违反停战协定的事件，就达九百一十五起。备忘录着重指出，事实是，尽管朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府为朝鲜的和平统一作了一贯的努力，但是，朝鲜还没有统一，这完全是由于美国对朝鲜的侵略政策和美国军队霸占朝鲜南部的结果。
    备忘录指出，“委员会”的“报告”硬说什么在李承晚政权被打倒以后，朝鲜南部的一切都日益使人满意，朝鲜南部的经济进入了“发展和增长阶段”。备忘录在揭露这一彻头彻尾的谎言时说，张勉内阁不过是李承晚政府的翻版。张勉和李承晚一样，追随美国的侵略政策，拒绝人民的民主要求，拒绝朝鲜人民对和平统一祖国的一致愿望。目前，朝鲜南部的民族经济全面遭到破产，工厂数目比日本帝国主义统治时期减少了一半，倒闭和半倒闭工厂占全部工厂的75％；农田播种面积减少了六十万町步，使在解放前每年输出数百万石（一石合一百五十公斤）粮食的朝鲜南部，如今变成了每年不得不输入数百万石外国粮食的慢性饥饿地带。由于经济的破产和掠夺的加强，朝鲜南部广大人民呻吟在极端苦难的生活中。
    备忘录揭穿了“委员会”的报告，所再次鼓吹的“联合国监督下的选举”的陈词滥调的虚伪性。备忘录指出，所谓的“联合国监督下的选举”，只不过是制造和维持美国殖民地统治机构、并干涉朝鲜内政的手段而已。尤其是联合国在事实上是朝鲜战场上的交战一方，在联合国“监督下的选举”，朝鲜人民是绝不能接受的。
    备忘录接着说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府主张朝鲜的和平统一问题必须在自主的、没有任何外国干涉的情况下，在民主的基础上，以实施自由的南北总选举的方法来解决。这是能够和平统一朝鲜的唯一合理的现实方案。美国和南朝鲜统治集团拒绝这一方案，继续叫嚣“反共统一”，这是为了永久分裂朝鲜。
    备忘录重申朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在“八·一五”解放十五周年前夕所提出的和平统一朝鲜的新方案：作为过渡措施，实施南北朝鲜联邦制；如果南朝鲜当局不能立即接受联邦制，那么也可以组织由朝鲜南北部实业界代表组成的纯粹的经济委员会，进行南北间的物资交易，在经济建设中互助合作；与此同时，广泛地实施在科学、文化、艺术和体育等各方面的交流，实施人民之间的自由来往，首先实施书信来往。
    备忘录还提到，新方案中包括朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府继续主张的迫使美军撤出朝鲜南部，把南北朝鲜的军队各裁减到十万或十万以下；为了解决上述迫切问题，由南北朝鲜的代表在平壤、汉城或板门店进行协商。
    备忘录强调指出，朝鲜问题只能由朝鲜人民自己解决，联合国或其他任何机关和任何国家都不应当妨碍这一问题的解决。
    备忘录最后说，阻碍朝鲜人民要求朝鲜和平统一的民族愿望和使朝鲜南部沦于像今天这样破产局面的祸首，就是强占朝鲜南部的美帝国主义者。为了朝鲜问题的解决和朝鲜的和平统一，美帝国主义者必须从朝鲜南部撤走。联合国应当迅速采取措施，迫使盗用联合国招牌、强占朝鲜南部的美军立即撤走，必须解散被美国利用为执行美国侵略政策的工具的“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”。
