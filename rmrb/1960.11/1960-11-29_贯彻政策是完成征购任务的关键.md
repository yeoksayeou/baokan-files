Implementing Policies is Key to Completing Procurement Tasks
Li Ping, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shucheng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China

The broad masses of commune members in Shucheng County, Anhui Province, with their spirit of hard work and solid effort, achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture in 1960. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members in delivering grain to support national construction is very high. In just twenty-five days, the Longhekou and Zhangmuqiao communes completed their annual grain procurement tasks ahead of schedule. The Longgu Brigade of the Hepeng Commune, a large mountainous area that has always been short of grain, used to rely on the state for more than 400,000 jin of grain each year. This year, grain production increased greatly, transforming from a grain-deficient area to a surplus area, selling more than 300,000 jin of surplus grain. The commune members are in high spirits, full of joy, climbing mountains and crossing ridges to transport grain. Thanks to the active delivery of grain by the broad masses of commune members, the county had successfully completed its annual grain procurement task by November 13. At the same time, the lives of the people in both urban and rural areas of the county have been arranged and implemented; the seeds needed for next year have all been carefully selected and stored in warehouses.

The most fundamental reason why Shucheng County was able to complete its annual grain procurement task quickly and well is that it has unswervingly implemented the Party's grain procurement policies, and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and commune members. According to our experience, it is very important to focus on the following aspects:

Carefully verifying grain yields is an important basis for correctly implementing the Party's grain policies. Only by verifying yields can procurement work be established on an active and reliable foundation. In order to effectively verify yields and prepare grain distribution plans, we established grain yield estimation and evaluation committees (groups) at all levels of communes, production brigades, and production teams before the grain harvest. The Party secretaries at all levels served as directors, and cadres, Party members, League members, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants participated. We adopted the method of combining large-area observation with key investigations, combining visual estimation with calculation, and combining estimation with actual measurement and threshing to go deep into the fields, verify the area, clarify the variety, and check the crop growth. Then, we selected three types—upper, middle, and lower—to classify and predict the yield. In this way, we gained a relatively accurate understanding of grain yields. On this basis, we formulated a grain distribution plan based on the retention standards for rations, seeds, and feed. Through democratic evaluation and repeated comparison, reviewed level by level, and finally approved by the county Party committee, a preliminary decision was made. During the harvest, the county organized nearly 40,000 people into specialized harvesting teams to verify yields on-site and mobilized and organized more than 100,000 people from towns, villages, organs, schools, and factories to rush to harvest, accelerate threshing, and ensure that as soon as an area was ripe, it was harvested, threshed, and cleaned, all weighed, and sent to the state, commune, and brigade warehouses respectively, so that procurement, rations, and seeds were "three implemented."

In the procurement work, we realized the consistency between implementing policies and completing tasks. In the grain procurement tasks that were pre-estimated and allocated, the actual yield and the estimated yield cannot be completely accurate during weighing and storage. Therefore, on the premise of ensuring the completion of the procurement task, according to the principle of seasonal procurement and phased delivery, 30% was sold first when each section of crop was harvested, 40% was sold after harvesting and cleaning, and 30% was sold after the final clearing of the field. When about 70% of the task was completed, the grain yield was roughly determined, and a second review was conducted, and the final decision was made. Appropriate adjustments were made to some communes and teams whose actual yield differed greatly from the estimated yield. In the late autumn procurement alone, we made two adjustments, appropriately increasing the target for Shucha and other three communes where the actual grain harvest was higher than the estimated yield, and appropriately decreasing the target for Chunqiu and other two communes where the actual harvest was lower than the estimated yield. In this way, the policies were correctly implemented, and the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members to deliver grain was fully mobilized.

Grasping grain procurement on one hand and arranging for livelihoods on the other, so that grain procurement, distribution, and livelihood arrangements are closely integrated, is an important measure to correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the commune members, and to fully mobilize the commune members' enthusiasm for selling grain. Based on the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement, we reasonably determined the proportion of grain to be delivered in sections and the standard of grain retention according to the early, middle, and late autumn planting areas and different yields in different regions. For example, in mountainous areas where the area of early rice is small, the allocated proportion of early rice to be delivered is also small; in polder areas where the area of early rice is large, the allocated delivery proportion is also large. In this way, there is grain to be delivered to the state in each section, as well as rations and seeds for the masses. This ensures the unity of procurement and retention, and the close integration of procurement, distribution, and livelihood arrangements. In order to ensure that the livelihood arrangements of commune members are fully implemented, cadres at all levels go deep into communes, teams, and canteens to publicize the procurement tasks, rations, seeds, feed, and other grain retention standards to the masses, so that everyone understands them clearly. In the spirit of the grain management methods stipulated by the province and county and with foresight and leaving room for maneuver, we formulate grain consumption plans and properly arrange grain consumption. Combining procurement with inspection, we mobilize canteens to vigorously engage in vegetable production, plant melons and vegetables extensively, vigorously raise pigs and poultry, pickle and dry various vegetables, and store enough firewood. The rations for the 1,200 canteens in the county have been arranged until the new grain comes on the market next year, and 90,000 mu of vegetables and radishes have been planted, and firewood, salt, and oil have also been prepared separately. The lives of the commune members have all been arranged and implemented, which has further stimulated their enthusiasm for selling grain.

Strengthening political and ideological education is a guarantee for correctly implementing policies and smoothly completing procurement tasks. From the beginning of the procurement work to the completion of the task, we have always grasped ideological education. For example, in the process of selling grain, some comrades believed that the production tasks were tight, and they had to transport, thresh, and deliver grain to the warehouse in a timely manner, and they did not have enough labor, so they wanted to wait until the end of the three autumns before organizing grain delivery. In the later stage of grain sales, some cadres developed complacency. We conducted education based on different ideas at different periods. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, we adopted various methods throughout the county to inspire the masses to recall the fact that when they were affected by disasters in 1954, grain was transferred from other places to support them, explaining that this year the whole county won a bumper harvest, and we should, in the spirit of using abundance to make up for deficiencies, looking ahead and behind, and making long-term plans, retain enough rations and seeds, and actively sell the surplus grain to the state to support socialist construction. Then, through the county Party committee's four-level cadre meeting and the commune and team cadre meetings, policy education was repeatedly conducted to guide them to analyze and discuss, and to realize that as long as labor is reasonably arranged, the task of grain storage can be completed at the same time as the production task is completed. After improving the ideological understanding of the cadres, they used the production team as a unit and used the accounting method to make the commune members understand that early delivery of grain can better support national construction; the brigade can get cash in time to purchase production materials to expand production; it is convenient to do a good job in autumn distribution and arrange for a good life; selling grain as it is harvested can save the grain warehouses of the brigade and production team. After the broad masses of cadres and commune members understood these principles, their enthusiasm for delivering grain greatly increased, and their actions became more active. The Qianrenqiao Commune originally had a slow progress due to unreasonable labor arrangements. After solving ideological problems, it appropriately arranged a part of the labor to specialize in threshing and selling, and the daily progress increased from 180,000 jin to more than 700,000 jin.

Strengthening organizational leadership to ensure the completion of the procurement task from beginning to end. From the beginning to the end of the procurement, the Party committees at all levels have included the procurement work on the agenda of the Party committee. The secretaries of the county Party committee and the commune and brigade levels personally took charge and strengthened leadership. All members of the county Party committee were responsible for communes; in addition to one secretary in each commune who was specially responsible for grain, the remaining secretaries and members were responsible for brigades. Ideological mobilization was carried out level by level, covering grain harvesting, threshing, transportation, storage, livelihood arrangements, quality inspection, and acceptance, and one package to the end. The secretaries and members of Party organizations at all levels went deep into brigades, production teams, field bases, and warehouses to participate in harvesting, threshing, picking, and transporting, and carefully inspected grain quality and the implementation of the policy of pricing according to quality. The county and commune Party committees also conscientiously established and improved grain management institutions, equipped with 904 full-time grain administrators with Party members, League members, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants as the backbone, to ensure the inspection and safe storage of grain entering the warehouse. We also paid attention to grasping the later work of procurement to ensure the completion of the procurement work in one go. During the late autumn harvest, the county Party committee convened a grain work meeting of commune Party committee secretaries and finance and trade ministers to further implement policies, deploy the final procurement work, and propose measures to comprehensively complete this year's procurement task, and continue to boost their efforts. After the meeting, the communes convened meetings of cadres and commune members at all levels to further arrange labor and organize shock work. In early November, a high tide of grain delivery was launched, with fixed tasks and times for communes, brigades, and production teams, arranged daily, and completed the annual procurement task in one go.

    贯彻政策是完成征购任务的关键
    中共舒城县委书记处书记　李屏
    安徽省舒城县广大社员以苦干实干的精神，夺得了1960年的农业丰收。广大社员交售粮食支援国家建设的热情很高涨。龙河口、张母桥两公社只二十五天时间，就提前完成了全年粮食征购任务。一向缺粮的大山区河棚公社龙骨大队，每年要国家供应四十多万斤粮食，今年粮食大增产，由缺粮变余粮，出售余粮三十多万斤。社员们心情舒畅，喜气洋洋，爬山过岭，运送粮食。由于广大社员积极交售，全县到11月13日止，已胜利完成全年粮食征购任务。与此同时，全县城乡人民生活，也安排落实；明年所需种子都经过精选全部进了仓库。
    舒城县所以能够又快又好地完成全年粮食征购任务，最基本的一条是始终不渝地贯彻执行了党的粮食征购政策，充分调动了广大干部、社员的积极性。根据我们的体会，抓住以下几个方面是十分重要的。
    细致核实粮食产量，是正确执行党的粮食政策的重要依据，只有核实产量，才能使征购工作建立在积极可靠的基础上。为了切实核实产量，做好粮食分配计划，我们在粮食收获前，各公社、生产大队、生产队层层建立了粮食估产评议委员会（小组）。党的各级书记担任主任，吸收干部、党团员、贫农下中农参加。采取大面积观察与重点调查结合，目测与推算结合，估算与实测实打结合的办法，分头深入田间，查实面积，查清品种，查看作物生长情况。然后，选择上、中、下三种类型分类预测估产。这样，比较准确地掌握了粮食产量。在此基础上，根据口粮、种子、饲料的留量标准，制定粮食的分配方案。通过民主评议反复比较，逐级审查，最后经县委批准初步定案。在收获时，全县组织了近四万人的收打专业队，现场核实产量，并从城镇、农村、机关、学校、工厂发动和组织了十万多人突击抢收，加快脱粒，做到熟一块、收一块、打一块、清一块，全部过秤，分别送入国家、公社、大队仓库，使征购、口粮、种子“三落实”。
    在征购工作中，我们认识到贯彻政策与完成任务的一致性，对预先估产分配的粮食征购任务，在过秤入库中，实产与估产不可能完全精确，因此在保证完成征购任务的前提下，根据分季征购、分段交售的原则，每段作物收获时，先卖30％，收割清卖40％，最后清场再卖30％。当完成任务70％左右的时候，粮食产量大体定局，又进行一次复核，最后定案。对某些实产与估产有悬殊的社、队，适当调整。仅在晚秋征购中，我们就进行了二次调整，将实收粮食高于估产的舒茶等三个公社，适当调高；将低于估产的春秋等二个公社适当降低。这样，既正确贯彻了政策，又充分调动了干部、社员的交售积极性。
    一手抓粮食征购，一手抓生活安排，使粮食征购、分配、生活安排三者紧密结合，是正确处理国家、集体、社员三者关系，充分调动社员售粮积极性的重要措施。我们根据统筹兼顾、全面安排的原则，按照不同地区早、中、晚秋种植面积和不同的产量，合理确定粮食分段交售比例和留粮标准。如山区早稻面积小，分配的早稻交售比例就小；圩畈地区早稻面积大，分配的交售比例也大。这样，每段有交售国家的粮食，也有群众的口粮、种子。作到了购留统一，使征购、分配、生活安排三者密切结合。为了使社员生活安排全部落实，各级干部深入社、队和食堂，把征购任务、口粮、种子、饲料等留粮标准，向群众公布，使人人心里明白。本着省、县规定的粮食管理办法和瞻前顾后、留有余地的精神，制订用粮计划，妥善安排粮食消费。结合征购进行检查，发动食堂大搞蔬菜生产，大种瓜菜，大力养猪、养家禽，腌、晒各种蔬菜，贮足柴草。全县一千二百个食堂的口粮已经安排到明年新粮登场，并且种菜、萝卜九万亩，柴草和油盐也分别作了准备，社员生活全部安排落实，更加激发了社员售粮的积极性。
    加强政治思想教育，是正确贯彻政策，顺利完成征购任务的保证。从征购工作开始到完成任务的整个过程中，我们一直抓紧了思想教育。如在售粮当中，有的同志认为生产任务紧张，又要及时运打、脱粒、送粮入库，劳力忙不开，想等三秋结束后，再组织送粮。在售粮后期，又有些干部产生自满情绪。我们根据不同时期的不同思想进行教育，秋收开始时，在全县范围内，采取多种多样的办法，启发群众回忆1954　年受灾时，外地调粮来支援的事实，说明今年全县赢得大丰收，应当根据以丰补歉、瞻前顾后、细水长流的精神，留足口粮、种子，积极把余粮卖给国家，支援社会主义建设。接着，通过县委四级干部大会，社、队干部会议，反复进行了政策教育，引导他们分析讨论，认识到只要合理安排劳力，完全可以在完成生产任务的同时，完成粮食入库任务，在提高干部思想认识以后，又以生产队为单位，通过算账办法，使社员了解到，早交售粮食可以更好地支援国家建设；大队可以及时得到现款购买生产资料扩大生产；便于搞好秋季分配，安排好生活；随收随交售，可以节省大队、生产队的粮食仓库。广大干部、社员认清了这些道理以后，交售粮食的热情大为提高，行动也更加积极。千人桥公社原来由于劳力安排不合理，进度慢，在解决思想问题后，适当安排了一部分劳力专门脱粒出售，日进度由十八万斤增加到七十多万斤。
    加强组织领导，保证善始善终完成征购任务。从征购开始到结束，各级党委都把征购工作列入党委的议事日程。县委和公社、大队各级书记都亲自挂帅，加强领导。所有的县委委员分别包社；各公社除有一个书记专门抓粮食外，其余书记和委员包大队。层层进行思想发动，包粮食收、打、运，包入库，包安排生活，包检查验收质量，一包到底。各级党组织的书记和委员，都深入大队、生产队、场基、仓库，参加收、打、挑、运，认真检查粮食质量和执行按质论价政策。县、社党委还认真地建立和健全粮食管理机构，配备了九百零四名以党团员、贫农下中农为骨干的专职粮食管理员，保证了粮食入库的检查和储藏安全，我们还注意了抓紧征购的后期工作，保证征购工作一气呵成。晚秋收获期间，县委召开了公社党委书记、财贸部长粮食工作会议，进一步贯彻了政策，部署了征购扫尾工作，提出了全面完成今年征购任务的措施，继续鼓足了干劲。会后，各公社层层召开了干部、社员会，进一步安排劳力，组织突击。在11月初，发动群众掀起了送粮高潮，公社、大队、生产队固定任务、时间，逐日安排，一鼓作气，完成了全年征购任务。
