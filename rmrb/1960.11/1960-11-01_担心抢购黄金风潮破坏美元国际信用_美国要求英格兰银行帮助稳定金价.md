Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 29th: The United States Treasury Department issued a communique on the 28th, hoping that the Bank of England would sell gold to alleviate the recent gold rush. The communique stated that if the Bank of England decides to intervene to stabilize the currently volatile gold market, the United States is prepared to support the Bank of England.

Agence France-Presse believes that the US Treasury Department's release of such a communique indicates concern here (in the United States) that the increasingly rising gold prices may damage the international credit of the dollar.

The situation this week shows that US gold reserves continue to decline. According to US bank business figures, the outflow of gold from the United States reached $98 million in the first three days of this week. In the seven days up to the 26th, foreign countries withdrew $108 million in gold from the $295 million earned from the US Federal Reserve System. In the first half of this year, the average weekly withdrawal of gold by foreign countries was only $5 million.

The US "Business Week" wrote on the 28th, "The wave of gold buying reflects a definite decline in confidence in the strength of the dollar... There is now widespread concern that the 1960-1961 (US) budget will show a deficit due to the economic recession."

    担心抢购黄金风潮破坏美元国际信用
    美国要求英格兰银行帮助稳定金价
    据新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国财政部28日发表了一份公报，希望英格兰银行抛售黄金来缓和最近的抢购黄金风潮。公报说，如果英格兰银行决定进行干预来稳定目前波动中的黄金市场的话，美国准备支持英格兰银行。
    据法新社认为，美国财政部发表这样一种公报，表明这里（美国）有这样的忧虑，即越来越上涨的黄金价格可能破坏美元的国际信用。
    这一周来的情况说明，美国的黄金储备继续降低。据美国银行的营业数字表明，在这个星期的头三天，美国外流的黄金就达到九千八百万美元。到26日为止的七天内，外国在从美国联邦储备系统赚得的二亿九千五百万美元中就提取了一亿零八百万美元的黄金。而在今年上半年，外国每周所提取的黄金平均只有五百万美元。
    美国“商业周刊”在28日写道，“抢购黄金的浪潮反映了对美元实力的信心肯定下降了……现在人们普遍担心，由于经济衰退，1960—1961年（美国）预算将出现赤字。”
