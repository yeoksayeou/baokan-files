Lianhuanhua, due to its combination of pictures and text, being easy to understand, having low cost, and being easy to widely circulate and read, is an extremely powerful weapon for conducting ideological education among workers, peasants, soldiers, and children. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Party and the government, lianhuanhua workers have undergone education and transformation, and publishing has undergone vigorous rectification and construction, so new lianhuanhua have grown and expanded rapidly. New lianhuanhua with positive and healthy ideological content quickly replaced the reactionary, pornographic, and absurd old lianhuanhua left over from the past.

The number of lianhuanhua has greatly developed in recent years. In 1952, the number of published titles nationwide was 1,378, with a print run of 21,700,800 copies. By 1958, after the Great Leap Forward, the number of published titles nationwide surged to 2,999, more than double that of 1952, and the print run was 122,650,000 copies, more than five times that of 1952. In the past ten years, the country has published nearly 20,000 titles, with a total print run of about 600 million copies. If we say that each lianhuanhua has at least ten readers (generally, a lianhuanhua has more than ten readers, often dozens or hundreds), then in the past ten years, there have been at least six billion readers. This shows how extensive the connection between lianhuanhua and the vast readership is.

The themes of lianhuanhua are becoming increasingly rich and novel, and the ideological and artistic quality is constantly improving. Themes that depict revolutionary struggles and revolutionary history, and praise revolutionary heroes, have increased significantly in recent years and have become the main varieties of lianhuanhua, playing a significant role in conducting proletarian revolutionary ideological education. Among the excellent works, such as "Chicken Feather Letter," "Child Labor," and "I Want to Study," "Reconnaissance Across the River," "Ten Thousand Waters and a Thousand Mountains," "Railway Guerrilla," and works adapted from Soviet literature such as "The Young Guard" and "How Steel Was Tempered," are all loved by the masses for their educational ideological content and beautiful artistic images. The glorious deeds of revolutionary heroes and martyrs such as Liu Hulan, Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, Yang Gensi, Luo Shengjiao, Wang Xiaohe, Xiang Xiuli, An Yemin, and Liu Xuebao have also been adapted into lianhuanhua one after another, which have been widely circulated among the masses and have produced great educational effects. Lianhuanhua has also shown its characteristics of timely propaganda and extensive education in reflecting current real struggles and cooperating with various political movements, especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Lianhuanhua, in coordination with the great movement of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, has conducted socialist and communist ideological education for the broad masses, further playing the combat role of revolutionary literary and artistic reading materials. Lianhuanhua authors from all over the country went deep into the worker-peasant masses and threw themselves into the real struggle, greatly tempered and transformed themselves, and created some excellent works that shone with the light of communist thought and possessed the ideological feelings of the new era, such as "For Sixty-One Class Brothers," which praised communist style and great class feelings, "Great Changes in Changshi" and "Wang Guofan and Jianming Cooperative," which praised the spirit of hard struggle of the poor stick to overcome poverty and build a new socialist countryside, "Carpenter's Wedding" and "A Serious Moment," which described the ideological character and heroic behavior of new era figures, and "Treading Down Shuangfeng Mountain," "The Biography of Li Shuangshuang," and "Red Flag Commune, Red Flag Flying," which reflected the development and great victory of the mass movement of the people's communes in urban and rural areas. Although these works have varying degrees of shortcomings in artistic expression, they all show a new prosperous scene of lianhuanhua creation with their brand-new content, brand-new characters, and rich and diverse, easy-to-understand expression techniques.

Although the achievements of lianhuanhua are so great, with the high-speed development of socialist construction in our country and the victorious advance of the cultural revolution, the task of conducting communist ideological education for the broad masses of the people is even more important. In particular, the rapid improvement of cultural life of hundreds of millions of peasants on the basis of the consolidation and development of the people's communes, as well as the strengthening of the education of 140 million children, make the task of lianhuanhua increasingly arduous. From the perspective of development needs, the ideological content of some of our lianhuanhua cannot well meet the needs of the new era. We know that our country has entered a new stage of socialist construction, and the revolutionary situation and the people's mental outlook have undergone tremendous changes. However, the theme thought of some lianhuanhua does not conform to the spirit of the times, and some shortcomings and errors often appear. Some works even distort reality, violate the Party's policies, and promote bourgeois ideology. For example, there are such works: depicting the protagonist undergoing several hardships and finally achieving success for personal gain. It seems to educate readers to have the spirit of courageous struggle, but in essence, it spreads the individualistic thought of personal struggle. Some works promote the thought of class reconciliation, regarding humiliation and forbearance in class struggle as virtues; works adapted from some foreign masterpieces also have the phenomenon of not analyzing and criticizing, blurring class viewpoints. Some works express the idea of ​​cause and effect, good and evil having their reward, as if as long as you have a kind heart, you can realize your beautiful wishes without hard struggle and subjective effort, which gives readers extremely harmful ideological influence. Although the above-mentioned works are only individual phenomena in the entire lianhuanhua, as a weapon of ideological education, these individual phenomena cannot be ignored.

The main reason why the creation of lianhuanhua lags behind the needs of the times is that the thinking of some lianhuanhua authors and editors lags behind the pace of the times, and their worldview and literary and artistic outlook have not been well transformed. Because they are separated from the worker-peasant masses and separated from the vigorous and great real struggle, it is naturally difficult for them to keep up with the needs of the times and the needs of the masses.

Conducting communist ideological education for readers through lianhuanhua should be the most important task of lianhuanhua publishing work. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously create and publish works that reflect the current great real struggle and praise new people and new things with the light of communist thought, as well as works that reflect the history of revolutionary struggle led by the Party. At the same time, we must also pay attention to meeting the diverse needs of the masses and strive to make the content rich in ideological education and diverse.

In order to strengthen the ideological education function of lianhuanhua, it is necessary to greatly improve the quality of lianhuanhua. We require that lianhuanhua must first have a strong political and ideological nature, and at the same time, it should have a beautiful artistic form accordingly. The fine arts creation of lianhuanhua should deeply portray the spirit and qualities of the figures of the new era, shape the ideological outlook of those earth-shattering communist heroes, and make the works full of the feelings of the era and strongly shine with the light of the era. This requires us to repeatedly and deeply understand and understand the new protagonists under our pen, not only to understand their clear and typical character and main characteristics, but also to carefully familiarize ourselves with their specific expressions and detailed activities, so that the creation can achieve vividness, richness, authenticity, and movingness. If the content and characters are only stopped at a superficial understanding, or erroneous assumptions and subjective guesses, it is of course impossible to carry out the creation correctly. We have seen that some authors start from the form alone, or only pursue skills, or blindly inherit the styles and techniques of others, thus producing false or rigid images, and even seriously harming the theme. In fine arts creation, we must also adhere to the national style that is loved by the worker-peasant masses. Only by improving along this direction can we guarantee the flourishing of lianhuanhua and powerfully publicize communist thought.

The lianhuanhua script not only determines the theme thought of a lianhuanhua, but also relates to the plot of the entire work and the ideological outlook of the characters, playing a decisive role in the political and artistic quality of the entire work. Therefore, strengthening the writing of lianhuanhua scripts (whether adapted or original) is the primary task of improving lianhuanhua. In addition to the content and ideological problems mentioned above, there are also some problems in the artistic processing of lianhuanhua scripts. Some scripts only have rough skeletons and no full flesh and blood, especially in reflecting the current great real life. Many works have monotonous content, poor stories, and lack in-depth descriptions of ideological feelings, which is extremely inconsistent with the rich and colorful real life. Some scripts also ignore continuity, with many clues and a chaotic structure, and some cram several details into one frame. The language of lianhuanhua scripts also needs to be improved. Some works have lengthy and rambling language, making them difficult to read and understand. Regarding the writing of lianhuanhua, we should also adopt the principle of "walking on two legs," combining professional and amateur. Conscientiously write more and better new scripts for the worker-peasant-soldier masses and for the children, especially scripts that reflect the great theme of current socialist construction. This is an ordinary yet glorious task.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Party, many young and excellent lianhuanhua workers have grown up, but it is still necessary to strengthen their study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong's works, establish a communist worldview and literary and artistic outlook, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the influence of old ideas and old feelings. Moreover, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses, go to the fiery real struggle, so that we can truly be tempered, transformed, and closely related to the great era and integrated with the broad masses. In this way, can we hold high the banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and advance victoriously with the era.

    连环画应加强传播共产主义思想
    姜维朴
    连环画由于图文结合，通俗易懂，成本较低，便于广泛流传和阅读，因而是向工农兵群众、向少年儿童进行思想教育的极其有力的武器。建国以来，在党和政府的领导下，连环画工作者经过了教育和改造，在出版方面也经过大力整顿和建设，所以新的连环画很快地成长壮大起来。具有积极、健康的思想内容的新连环画，很快代替了过去遗留下来的反动、黄色、荒诞的旧连环画。
    连环画的数量几年来已有很大发展。1952年全国出版种数为一千三百七十八种，印数为二千一百七十万零八千册。而到1958年大跃进以后，全国出版种数激增至二千九百九十九种，为1952年的两倍多，印数为一亿二千二百六十五万册，为1952年的五倍还多。十年来全国共出版种数将近二万种，总印数约达六亿册左右。如果说，每册连环画的读者至少为十人（一般情况一本连环画的读者不止十人，而往往几十人到几百人），那么十年来就至少有六十亿人次的读者。由此可见连环画与广大读者是有着多么广泛的联系。
    连环画的题材日益丰富新颖，思想质量和艺术质量也在不断提高。表现革命斗争和革命历史、歌颂革命英雄人物的题材，近几年来显著增加，而且已成为连环画主要的品种，在进行无产阶级革命思想教育方面，发挥了很大的作用。其中优秀作品如《鸡毛信》、《童工》和《我要读书》、《渡江侦察记》、《万水千山》、《铁道游击队》及根据苏联文学作品编绘的《青年近卫军》、《钢铁是怎样炼成的》等作品，都以其富有教育意义的思想内容和优美的艺术形象，受到群众喜爱。革命英雄烈士如刘胡兰、董存瑞、黄继光、杨根思、罗盛教、王孝和、向秀丽、安业民、刘文学等人物的光辉事迹，也都先后编绘成连环画，在群众中广为流传，产生了极大的教育作用。连环画在反映当前现实斗争、配合历次政治运动方面，也显示出它宣传及时、教育广泛的特点，尤其1958年大跃进以来，连环画配合总路线、大跃进、人民公社的伟大运动，对广大群众进行了社会主义和共产主义思想教育，进一步发挥了革命文艺读物的战斗作用。各地连环画作者深入工农群众，投身现实斗争，大大锻炼改造了自己，创作了一些闪耀着共产主义思想光辉的、具有新时代思想感情的优秀作品，如歌颂共产主义风格和伟大的阶级感情的《为了六十一个阶级弟兄》，歌颂以艰苦奋斗的穷棒子精神战胜贫困而建设起社会主义新农村的《长石巨变》和《王国藩和建明社》，描写新时代人物思想品德和英雄行为的《木匠迎亲》和《严重的时刻》，反映城乡人民公社群众运动的开展和伟大胜利的《踏平双峰山》、《李双双小传》、《红旗公社红旗飘》等。这些作品在艺术表现上虽有不同程度的缺点，但都以其崭新的内容、崭新的人物和丰富多样、通俗易懂的表现手法，显示出连环画创作的新的繁荣景象。
    连环画的成就虽然如此巨大，但是，随着我国社会主义建设高速度的发展和文化革命的胜利前进，向广大人民群众进行共产主义思想教育的任务更加重要，尤其亿万农民在人民公社巩固发展的基础上文化生活飞快提高，以及对一亿四千万少年儿童培养教育工作的加强，都使连环画的任务越来越为繁重。从发展的需要来看，我们有些连环画的思想内容还不能很好地切合新时代的需要。我们知道，我们的国家已进入社会主义建设的新阶段，革命的形势和人民的思想面貌都发生了巨大的变化。但是，有的连环画的主题思想却不符合时代的精神，常常出现一些缺点和错误。有的作品甚至歪曲现实，违背了党的方针政策，宣扬了资产阶级的思想意识。例如就有这样的作品：表现主人公为了个人的利益，经历了若干艰难困苦，终于成功名就。看来似乎是教育读者要有勇敢斗争的精神，但实质上是传播个人奋斗的个人主义思想。有的作品，宣扬了阶级调和的思想，把阶级斗争中的屈辱忍让作为美德；从外国的一些名著编绘的作品，也有不加分析批判，模糊阶级观点的现象。有的作品则表现了善恶到头总有报的因果报应思想，似乎只要有善良的心肠，不用通过艰苦斗争，不用主观的努力，就可以实现美好的愿望，这就给读者以极有害的思想影响。上述的作品，虽则在整个连环画中还只是个别的现象，但作为一种思想教育武器，这些个别现象也是不容忽视的。
    连环画创作所以存在跟不上时代需要的现象，主要原因是有些连环画作者和编辑的思想落后于时代的脚步，世界观和文艺观还未很好改造。他们由于脱离工农群众，脱离轰轰烈烈的伟大现实斗争，自然很难跟上时代的需要和群众的需要。
    通过连环画向读者进行共产主义思想教育，应该是连环画出版工作的最重要任务，因此就需要大力创作、出版反映当前伟大现实斗争的和歌颂具有共产主义思想光辉的新人新事的作品，以及反映党所领导的革命斗争历史的作品。同时，我们也要注意满足群众多方面的需要，要力争题材内容既富有思想教育，又能丰富多样。
    为了加强连环画的思想教育作用，必须大力提高连环画的质量。我们要求连环画首先要具有强烈的政治思想性，同时，相应地要具有优美的艺术形式。连环画的美术创作，应该深入刻划新时代人物的精神、品质，塑造那些惊天动地的共产主义英雄们的思想面貌，使作品充满着时代的感情，强烈地闪耀着时代的光辉。这样，就要求我们反复地、深入地体会和理解我们笔下新的主人公，不仅理解他们的鲜明典型性格，主要特征，而且还要细致地把熟悉他们的具体表现和细节活动，以便使创作能够达到生动丰富、真实动人。如果对内容人物只是停止在一知半解的了解，或是错误的设想和主观的猜测，当然不可能正确地进行创作。我们看到有的作者单从形式出发，或只是追求技巧，或盲目因袭别人的风格手法，因而产生虚伪的、或是呆板僵化的形象，甚至严重地伤害了主题。在美术创作上，还必须坚持为工农群众喜爱的民族风格，只有沿着这样的方向来提高，才能保证连环画的百花盛开，有力地宣传共产主义思想。
    连环画脚本，不仅决定一本连环画的主题思想，而且关系整个作品的故事情节、人物思想面貌，对整个作品的政治质量和艺术质量都起着决定性作用。因此，加强连环画脚本编写（不论是改编和创作）是提高连环画的首要工作。连环画脚本除了存在前面所谈到的内容思想的问题外，在艺术加工上，也存在一些问题，有些脚本只有粗略的骨骼，没有丰满的血肉，尤其在反映当前伟大现实生活方面，不少作品内容单调，故事贫乏，缺乏思想感情的深入描写，与丰富多彩的现实生活极不相称。也有些脚本忽视了连续性，头绪纷纭，结构杂乱，有的一幅中就挤进几个细节。连环画脚本的语言也需要改进。有些作品语言冗长拉杂，阅读起来吃力费解。关于连环画的编写工作，也应该采取“两条腿走路”的方针，专业和业余相结合。认真地为工农兵群众、为孩子们编写更多更新的好脚本，尤其是反映当前社会主义建设这一伟大题材的脚本。这是一项平凡而又光荣的任务。
    建国以来，在党的领导下，许多年青、优秀的连环画工作者成长起来了，但是还必须加强他们对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东著作的学习，树立共产主义世界观和文艺观，坚决地彻底地破除旧思想旧感情的影响。而且必须遵从毛主席的指示，到工农兵群众中、到火热的现实斗争中，使自己真正地受到锻炼，得到改造，与伟大时代息息相关，与广大群众融为一体。这样，才能高举起毛主席文艺思想旗帜，和时代一同胜利前进。
