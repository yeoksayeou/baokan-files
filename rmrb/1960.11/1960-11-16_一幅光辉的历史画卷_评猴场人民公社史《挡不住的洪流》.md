    ——Review of the History of the Monkey Field People's Commune, "Irresistible Torrent"
    Ma Wenbing
    People all have this experience: every time they read an excellent work, it always deepens their understanding of life, adds new elements to their thinking, and their excited mood cannot calm down for a long time. The Monkey Field People's Commune History "Irresistible Torrent," compiled by the Guizhou Provincial Literary Editing Training Class and published by the Writers Publishing House, is such a work. This work has unique achievements in both thought and art, and is a new and important gain in mass creation.

    The Monkey Field People's Commune is located in Wangmo County, Guizhou Province, where several ethnic groups, including Miao, Buyi, and Han, reside. Over the past thirty years, this remote mountainous area with multiple ethnic groups, like other parts of the country, has undergone tremendous and profound changes. This commune history records in detail the life and struggles of the Monkey Field people over the past thirty years, and especially vividly depicts the era since the Great Leap Forward. It is the most authentic portrayal of history and the most enthusiastic ode to the Party and the people.

    I
    Literary works are all reflections of a certain social life; therefore, the depth and breadth of reflecting life become important principles for measuring a work. Commune history has its own characteristics in reflecting reality, but in this respect, it is consistent with the requirements of other literary styles. The most important achievement of "Irresistible Torrent" lies in its profound and broad reflection of reality. It takes people as the center (mainly advanced figures among the working masses), selects typical and important events, and vividly depicts the spiritual outlook and contradictory struggles of different classes in various stages of historical development.

    Opening the book, it is the 1930s, which is a dark night, but there are also sparks of wildfire. In the dark night, this wildfire is the people's light and the people's hope.

    The feudal reactionary forces in this area cruelly exploited and oppressed the people. Xiao Luoshan, known as the "Miao King," is the representative figure. He independently levied donations, raised soldiers, made laws, and set up execution grounds. He extracted every drop of marrow, acted recklessly, and if extorting money was not satisfactory, he would kill people or throw them alive into his "Dragon Cave." In this man-eating Dragon Cave alone, "more than two hundred lives were swallowed in just twenty years, with piles of white bones at the bottom of the cave, and the yellow soil around the cave stained black by years of blood." He "divided the land to cover the sky, dominating one side," seemingly a "local emperor," but in reality colluding with the Kuomintang reactionaries. Moreover, the reactionary government gave him many grand titles. Therefore, Xiao Luoshan is not only a representative of feudal despots, but his rule is also the foundation of the Kuomintang reactionary government's enslavement of the people; he embodies the common characteristics of the man-eating reactionary rule.

    Living in such a dark reality, how should people live? Should they endure or resist? The laboring people, who have long been immersed in seas of blood and hatred, gradually realized that only struggle can ensure their survival. What they uttered was not a humble lament, but a magnificent roar. "Kase's Roar," like the best tape recorder, accurately recorded the angry roar of the Kase people. Although the roar we hear is broadcast through a "tape recorder," it still has a powerful force that shakes the soul. Xiao Luoshan is a ferocious demon king, with hundreds of "henchmen who eat people without spitting out bones" under his command, as well as various killing weapons and the support of the reactionary government; while the people are unarmed, which determines that this struggle is fierce and cruel. However, the heroic images of the people stand up one by one in such a heroic struggle. Wang Laohuai, who is loyal, enthusiastic, far-sighted, Wang Laolu, who charges ahead and retreats behind, Zhou the blacksmith, who risks bringing salt for the masses, and Luo Meimei, who goes to battle with a big belly, are all radiant. Although many people sacrificed in the struggle, and there was a shortage of food and salt, so they could only eat grass roots and bark, they still maintained high morale and persisted in the struggle, fully reflecting the revolutionary spirit of the laboring people to dare to struggle and their indomitable perseverance.

    Naturally, there are also a few people whose bones have been softened by life. Wei Yabie is an example. He "is a good old man who doesn't say two words in three days," and "spends all day working and smoking leaf tobacco, never daring to get involved in any trouble." Even so, reality does not allow him to live in peace, and disasters fall on his head one after another. He is beaten, pays compensation, loses his big ox, and almost loses his life. His weak and submissive character is in stark contrast to the daring-to-struggle people like Wang Laohuai. Two kinds of characters, two kinds of destinies, reveal to us this truth: to compromise, to submit, to let the enemy choke your neck and dare not fight back, hoping that the enemy will show kindness without struggle, is a dead end; on the contrary, to stand tall and resist bravely, not to beg the enemy in a low voice, but to fight back with an iron fist, is the only way to live.

    "Kase's Roar" is only the beginning of the struggle. Although it did not achieve a complete victory, it made people clear about the way to survive. Later, the revolutionary fire burned more fiercely. Thanks to the leadership of the Party, the masses' struggle changed from spontaneous to conscious, from not finding a way out to successive victories. The unyielding people of Monkey Field finally saw "The End of the Little 'Dynasty'." The dark night has passed, and the dawn of a new era has shone here.

    The wheels of the times continue to roll, and the revolution continues to develop. In the new historical period, a new struggle has begun, which is the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. This struggle is sharp and complex. It is profoundly reflected in "Irresistible Torrent." After land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and other movements, the despotic landlords were eliminated. However, the remaining landlord and rich peasant elements were always engaged in sabotage activities in secret. Like Xie Shaoqing, this bad guy who had been a puppet head of Jia, a company commander, and punished by the people's court, his reactionary heart never died. He incited backward commune members to make trouble, wooed muddle-headed and wavering cadres, framed strong leading backbone members, provoked relations between middle and poor peasants, and organized bandits to attack the people's government with arms. His sinful activities, although they caused a brief storm, were easily defeated and quelled. In a sense, the struggle against the spontaneous forces of capitalism, represented by a small number of well-to-do middle peasants, is a more serious and arduous task than the struggle against a small number of bad elements on the two roads. The valuable thing about "Irresistible Torrent" is that it does not stop at the general reflection of the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, but digs deep and refines a series of artistic images from life to comprehensively express the face of class struggle in this period. There is the struggle against poor peasants who are seriously influenced by capitalist ideology, the struggle against cadres who have committed right-leaning errors, and, more importantly, the struggle against representatives of various spontaneous forces taking the capitalist road. The book has written down more than a dozen such character images, each with its own characteristics, but in their characteristics, the common class essence is infiltrated. Wang Shaohua in "Grass and Seedling Competition" is a speculative, opportunistic, and capable person who wants to make a fortune by doing business wholeheartedly; Luo Huaming in "The 'Omnipotent Man' Joins the Society," known as the "omnipotent man," has a lot of skills, not only is he good at farming, but also "learned many crafts when he was young, he is both a carpenter, a blacksmith, and a stonemason." At the same time, his son, daughter-in-law, and daughter are all strong and capable; while the old wizard in "The Old Wizard Changes His Profession" has a different face, he can exchange food and drink by asking gods and sending ghosts, he is lazy and does not work hard, and all the farm work is done by women. The personalities and ideological faces of these three people are very different, but what is consistent is that they are unwilling to take the road of collectivization, and use their own characteristics as a shield to resist socialist transformation. There are also people who do not stubbornly insist on taking the capitalist road, and even follow the trend into the society, but they always waver, and once they have the opportunity, they follow the rich peasants to make waves. Wu Zhaoming in "The Storm of Cattle Joining the Society" is like this. Di Guanfu and Di Guangyao in "Storm" are another situation. Di Guanfu had been bullied by puppet township and Bao chiefs, so he was very active in clearing bandits and opposing bullies and landlords, and became the chairman of the farmers' association and a township cadre. But slowly, his revolutionary enthusiasm was not as high as before. In addition, his respected position as the head of the clan developed a bad habit of being the only one who is right, self-righteous, loving flattery, and hating criticism, so he gradually left politics, left the Party, and was almost dragged into the mud by bad elements. Di Guangyao was also very active in the revolution at the beginning, and was the village chief during the land reform. Because the land reform did not bring him much benefit, he perfunctorily did his work, abandoned the revolution to seek the way to get rich, and as a result, he was pulled to reaction by counter-revolutionary elements... We should not only see the meaning of these character images as existing alone, but should regard them as a whole, understand them from the overall perspective, and then we can understand how complex and arduous the class struggle in the countryside is. It is very valuable to be able to reflect the spiritual outlook of the representatives of spontaneous forces so truthfully and deeply in a commune history.

    II
    "Irresistible Torrent" not only vividly depicts the representatives of all kinds of capitalist spontaneous forces, but also portrays many socialist revolutionary vanguards and pioneers with distinct personalities. Li Heqing, Wu Shibao, Xie Lao Si, etc. are all representative figures. Wu Ping'an in "Torrent" and Xie Shunzhou in "Storm" are both written vividly, prominently showing their excellent and noble ideological qualities. All this powerfully shows the decisive significance of the Party's leadership for the socialist revolution, and shows the strength of the socialist forces. Therefore, despite the serious struggle, the people of Monkey Field quickly embarked on the road of rural socialist revolution from mutual aid teams.

    In 1958, the Chinese people obtained the three magic weapons for building socialism, and reality became extraordinarily brilliant. This commune history used colorful strokes to depict the picture of the Great Leap Forward, expressing the people's high communist enthusiasm, and praising the great victory of the three red flags.

    During the Great Leap Forward, like the whole of China, the Monkey Field People's Commune underwent earth-shaking changes. Here, it used to be cloudy, with beacons all over the mountains, but now it is shining with silver light, with roaring furnaces; People who "never knew whether pig iron grew on trees or in the soil" have now built their own blast furnaces, and have been using crude sickles and hoes for farming for generations, and now they are making their own seeders and rice transplanters, ...

    Reality is changed by people, and people are also transforming themselves in the process of transforming reality. Therefore, the deepening of the revolution is most profoundly reflected in the changes in the spiritual outlook of people. "Irresistible Torrent" vividly reflects this change. Wei Changlu, the son of Wei Yabie, did not inherit his father's cowardly character, but became a capable cadre of the Party. The huge difference in the spiritual outlook of the father and son reflects two different eras. The broad masses are no longer so restrained and conservative, but are carrying forward their revolutionary enthusiasm, working and creating with high spirits. Many of the images portrayed in this commune history are vivid, lifelike, respectable and lovable. Like Luo Xiaosan in "Furnace Fire Red Heart," his chest is really beating with a red heart. He works selflessly, dares to think and act, and is trained from a novice in ironmaking to a furnace master who constantly innovates and creates, and grows from an ordinary peasant to an outstanding director of an ironmaking plant. What is particularly exciting is that women who have just been freed from shackles are shining brightly in every ordinary post. Like Wei Jinmei in "Between Sisters-in-Law," she is humble, sincere, and generous, and her soaring labor enthusiasm and tenacious willpower are even more touching. She goes to the ground to cut rice seedlings before the moon sets, and when she sees that there is a shortage of people to plow the fields, she automatically learns to plow the fields. Plowing is not only heavy labor, but there is also a superstitious concept that "girls plowing the fields will cause drought for three years." She is not afraid of hardship or bound by old traditions, and is determined to learn to plow the fields. The deeds of Luo Meimei in "Mother Wei" are also very touching. She is a nursery worker in the commune's nursery, but people respectfully call her Mother Wei. She patiently and diligently does the work of holding children, washing feces and urine, and loves other people's children more than her own. When she is busy, she would rather let her own child cry than take care of other people's children well. When the number of children in the nursery increases and there are not enough quilts, she takes the good cotton quilt that she has been divided into during the "land reform" and has never been willing to use. From these actions, we can see that what is bursting out of her is the spark of new ideas. The advanced figures mentioned here are just examples. In the magnificent revolutionary movement, there are not just one or two advanced figures, but thousands of them. This commune history strives to express the glorious group portrait of the working people. The younger generation described in "Concerto" and "Red Flag Children" are all full of vigor, full of revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism. This series of glorious images of the working people clearly tells us who are the heroes of our time.

    The relationship between people, especially between ethnic groups, has also undergone fundamental changes. Before liberation, due to the oppression, discrimination, and sowing discord by the ruling class, suspicion and hatred were created among various ethnic groups; after liberation, under the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, people truly understood that the evil old social system was the root cause of ethnic contradictions and disputes. On the basis of communist ideology, the people of all ethnic groups have established a new and friendly relationship. This work, "Relatives," through the description of Zheng Zhihua and Ban Liumei, two working women, from strangers to understanding each other, to the development of mother-daughter-like feelings in cooperative labor, vividly expresses the changes in the relationship between the Han and Miao peoples. This change in ethnic relations is the result of the socialist revolution and the victory of the Party's great ethnic policy.

    "Irresistible Torrent" is a glorious historical scroll. It depicts the life, struggle, and multifaceted changes of the Monkey Field people over the past thirty years. From this scroll, we can see that under the leadership of the Party, the Monkey Field people have worked hard, struggled continuously, and changed from slaves to masters, from hell to heaven, from backward to advanced, and continue to leap forward. Therefore, we say that "Irresistible Torrent" is the history of the Monkey Field people's struggle, growth, entrepreneurship, and leap forward.

    Although "Irresistible Torrent" is the history of the Monkey Field People's Commune, in some respects, it is also the common history of many people's communes in our country and the epitome of the history of the struggle of our country's peasants. It demonstrates with vivid historical facts the truth that the vast number of peasants in our country have experienced together: only by relying on the leadership of the Party and only by continuous struggle can we achieve victory; the three red flags are the flags of victory and the flags of happiness; and it also irrefutably shows that the working people are the creators of history and the masters of history. There is no doubt that this commune history is a very good life textbook for each of us.

    Our enemies and right-leaning opportunists have done everything they can to slander and denigrate the three red flags. This commune history provides a powerful criticism. The iron history is the most authoritative spokesperson. It tells us how eagerly the working people yearn to change the face of "poverty and blankness," and how long and arduous a road they have traveled to step on the "golden bridge" of the people's commune. They are leaping toward the ideal paradise through this "golden bridge," which no one can stop. Under the leadership of the Party, the torrent formed by the determination of the 600 million people to take the socialist road is an unstoppable torrent. It constantly breaks through all obstacles and forever roars on the broad socialist riverbed of our country...

    III

    What should be mainly written in the commune history? Some people used to be unclear. Some commune histories either list numbers or express the suffering before liberation and the happiness after liberation from the phenomena of life, which is necessary, but it is not enough if it is limited to this. This can only show some signs of the changes of the times, but cannot reveal how history changes and develops. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "Class struggle, some classes have won, and some classes have been eliminated. This is history, this is thousands of years of civilization history." ① Commune history is the history of class struggle, so the main thing in commune history is to write about class struggle. It reflects the main contradictions of a certain era and reveals the essence of the contradictions and the future of the development of the struggle. To reflect correctly and deeply, we must stand on the proletarian position, be full of revolutionary ideals, fully understand the important position of the working people in the struggle, praise advanced figures and advanced ideas, and criticize the reactionary class and reactionary ideas. "Irresistible Torrent" is precisely the product of following Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and practicing them, so it has achieved great achievements and profoundly reproduced the essential face of historical development.

    Related to the content is how should the commune history be written? That is, mainly write about people or events? "Irresistible Torrent" provides good artistic experience in this regard. It is centered on characters, organically weaving together the characterization of characters and the narration of historical events. It does not let historical facts drown out character personalities, nor does it fabricate plots like novels to express the spiritual outlook of characters from multiple perspectives. Instead, it lets the characters appear in sharp contradictions and conflicts to show their thoughts and personalities, and supplements them with necessary generalized introductions and detailed descriptions. Writing characters and creating typical images of advanced figures is the main means for literature to play its role, and therefore it is an important task of literary creation. Commune history should and can fully undertake this task. As a literary style, commune history is different from general historical works. It mainly relies not on numbers or abstract reasoning, but on real historical pictures and vivid character images to infect and educate people. Therefore, I think it is correct and a good method to put people - mainly advanced figures among the working people - in the central position to write in the commune history, and it is worth advocating. It is a bit one-sided to think that writing about people hinders writing about history. People and history cannot be separated. Since history is the class struggle between people, then people must be expressed in history, and writing history must write about people's activities. Only by grasping the typical life events in class struggle can we powerfully express the characters; and only by drawing vivid characters can we write history more truly and deeply. The achievements of this book fully prove this point.

    In art, this book shows its own characteristics in many aspects. There are various techniques for characterization: some express personality through the description of character actions, some focus on the revelation of the inner world; some are completely white painting techniques, and some borrow from the rendering of the environment and atmosphere; some are placed at the forefront of the contradiction with a big axe, and some are carefully crafted through daily life events. For a character, sometimes one technique is used, and more often multiple techniques are used in combination. Zeng Zhengpin in "Red Flag Children" showed his personality characteristics in sharp contradictions and conflicts. He used a waterwheel by himself and spun it for half a day without turning red or panting; the team's tall and strong fierce horse had sores on its belly and needed to be medicated. It kicked and jumped and could not be approached, but Zeng Zhengpin took the opportunity to pounce and hug its two hind legs, and then applied the medicine; another time, a mountain flood broke out, and the roaring yellow waves several feet high suddenly washed away the waterwheel. Zeng Zhengpin immediately jumped into the water. The waves submerged him, and people were worried about his safety, but he hugged the waterwheel and showed his head. With just these few plots, the image of this strong, brave, fearless, and enthusiastic young peasant stood up. In "Torrent," however, great attention is paid to the revelation of the inner activities of the president, Wu Ping'an. Relying on this diversified description technique, the characterization of characters is rich and colorful: some are bold and vigorous, and some are gentle and graceful, thereby increasing the artistic appeal.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction to create works with a Chinese style and Chinese spirit that the masses love to hear and see has been the goal of the compilers of this book from the beginning. In practice, they have also implemented the principle of combining with the masses, and have therefore achieved remarkable results. This is most prominently manifested in the language. Literature is the art of language. Some successful works must have accurate, vivid, and lively language. But where does this language come from? Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: There are infinitely rich literary treasures among the people. All excellent works are the result of hard digging into the life of the masses. Of course, language is no exception. It is understood that in the writing process of "Irresistible Torrent," a movement against the "intellectual tone" was launched, advocating learning lively and beautiful language from the masses. In order to ensure the colloquial nature of the work, they generally adopted the first-person writing method. After sorting out the works, they read them to the masses, repeatedly revised them, and stopped only after reaching the point where the masses loved to hear and see them. It is precisely through this arduous effort that the language of this people's commune history has the characteristics of simplicity, vividness, and liveliness, revealing the fragrance of the soil. Colloquial but not clumsy, simple but not vulgar, often a vivid and figurative language vividly portrays a character's personality; often a clever metaphor pinpoints the character's face. Just as the author of this book said in "The Writing Process": "We can't think of the language of the masses and the description of characters and events by sitting in the room for a lifetime." This is a truth realized from practice. Of course, art is not equal to life, and spoken language is not entirely pure and beautiful literary language. It must also be processed and refined to remove dust and make the language shine. I think the language achievement of "Irresistible Torrent" lies in the fact that it not only retains the characteristics of the language of the masses, but is also processed, both pure and unspotted, and reads easily and smoothly, vividly. The dialogue of the characters is very important in the work. To write it with a unique personality, one must pay hard work. This book is also relatively successful in this regard. The language of most characters shows the personality of the characters, and it is written very concisely. This successful language has played an active role in the ideological and characterization of the work. "Irresistible Torrent" vividly tells me that accurate, vivid, and lively language is in the people. The people are the real masters of language. We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and always learn from the people!

    I also think that the local characteristics of the commune history are one of the issues that should be paid special attention to in writing. "Irresistible Torrent" has more prominent achievements in this regard than other published commune histories. In addition, the structure is relatively strict and complete, taking the historical development of class struggle as the red line, and connecting the separate chapters that express multifaceted life well. The major revolutionary events in this area since 1930 have been reflected. In each period, attention is also paid to depicting the whole picture. For example, when writing about the period after the establishment of the People's Commune, around the establishment of the commune, the development of production, the changes in the spiritual outlook, the changes in old customs, the improvement of living welfare, etc. are described. The paintings on different sides jointly form a complete and magnificent picture of the era of the Great Leap Forward. In this way, the "line" and the "surface" are well combined. We can see the context of historical development, and also understand the various aspects of a period.

    These successful artistic experiences of "Irresistible Torrent" deserve attention, because it is of great significance to the development and improvement of the commune history.

    From the above analysis, we can know that the magnificent "Irresistible Torrent" is rich and profound in content, and also has unique achievements in art. We are pleased to see that in a short period of two years, the new seedling of commune history has flourished with lush foliage and full of fruit, and it can be asserted that it will grow more vigorously in the future, and will increasingly show its strong vitality and the value of independent existence. When it is completely written by the working people themselves, it will be more profound, more perfect, more touching, and more glorious historical scrolls will emerge.

    "Irresistible Torrent" is a true mass creation, with more than a thousand people participating in the creation. This shows that "China's literature and art have become a mass undertaking of the working people." ② Most of the recorders and organizers are people with a middle school education. Their cultural level is not high, and their creative experience is limited, but because they have adhered to the leadership of the Party, implemented the principle of combining with the working masses, vigorously carried out mass movements, and gave full play to collective wisdom, after unremitting efforts, they have finally written this excellent work. This is another victory for the Party's literary and artistic line and another great victory for Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

    一幅光辉的历史画卷
    ——评猴场人民公社史《挡不住的洪流》
    马文兵
    人们都有这样的体验，每读过一部优秀的作品，总是加深了对生活的理解，思想中增添了新的因素，激动的心情久久不能平静下来。贵州省文艺编辑训练班整理、作家出版社出版的猴场人民公社史《挡不住的洪流》就是这样的作品。这部作品，在思想上艺术上都有独特的成就，是群众创作中一个新的重要的收获。
    猴场人民公社，在贵州省望谟县，这里居住着苗、布依、汉等几个民族。三十年来，这个多民族的偏远的山区，和祖国其他地方一样，发生了巨大而深刻的变化。这部公社史，详实地记录了猴场人民三十年来的生活和斗争，而特别色彩浓重地描绘了大跃进以来的时代面貌。它是历史的最真实的写照，又是对党对人民最热情的赞歌。
    一
    文学作品都是一定社会生活的反映，因而反映生活的深度和广度就成为衡量一部作品的重要原则。公社史在反映现实上有自己的特点，但在这点上和文学的其他样式的要求是一致的。《挡不住的洪流》的最重要的成就，就在于它反映现实的深刻和广阔。它以人物为中心（主要是劳动群众中的先进人物），选取典型的重要的事件，鲜明地描写了历史发展各个阶段中不同阶级的精神面貌和矛盾斗争。
    掀开书，是三十年代，这正是漆漆的黑夜，却也有星星的野火。在黑夜中，这野火是人们的光明，是人们的希望。
    这个地区的封建反动势力，残酷地剥削压迫人民。号称“苗王”的小罗山就是代表人物。他自派捐款，自养兵丁，自制法律，自设刑场。敲骨吸髓，胡作非为，敲诈钱财一不顺心，就把人砍死或活生生地丢入他的“龙洞”。仅是这个吃人的龙洞，短短二十年间，“就吞下了两百多条性命，洞底白骨山积，洞边的黄土已被历年的血污浸成了黑色。”他“划地遮天，独霸一方”，看来是个“土皇帝”，实际是和国民党反动派勾结在一起的。而且反动政府给他戴上许多堂皇的冠冕。因而小罗山不仅是封建恶霸的一个代表，他的统治也正是国民党反动政府奴役人民的基础，他体现的是吃人的反动统治的共同特色。
    处身在这样的黑暗现实里，人们该怎样生活呢？是忍受还是反抗？长期浸泡在血泊恨海里的劳动人民，逐渐认识到只有斗争才能生活下去。他们发出的不是低微的悲叹，而是雄壮的吼声。《卡塞的怒吼》，像最好的录音机一样，准确地录下了卡塞人民愤怒的吼声。我们听到的吼声尽管是通过“录音机”播送的，然而它仍具有震撼心灵的强大力量。小罗山是狰狞的魔王，他手下又有几百“吃人不吐骨头”的爪牙，他还有各种各样杀人的武器和反动政府的支持；而人民是手无寸铁，这就决定了这场斗争是激烈、残酷的。然而人民的英雄形象，正是在这样壮烈的斗争中，一个个站立起来了。那忠厚热情、深谋远虑的王老怀，那冲锋在前退却在后的王老禄，那自动为群众冒险弄盐的周铁匠，那挺着大肚子上阵的罗么妹，都光采照人。尽管在斗争中不少人牺牲了，同时缺粮又少盐，只能吃草根树皮，但他们仍情绪高昂地坚持斗争，充分地反映了劳动人民敢于斗争的革命精神和坚韧不拔的毅力。
    自然，也有少数被生活压软了骨头的人。韦鸦别就是例子。他“是个三天不说两句话的老好人”，“成天除了做活路就是抽叶子烟，从不敢沾惹一点是非。”即使这样，现实也不允许他苟安，灾难一件件降落在头上。挨打、赔钱、损了大牯牛，差些连性命也丢了。他的软弱屈从的性格和王老怀等敢于斗争的人们正好是鲜明的对照。两种性格、两种命运，向我们揭示了这样的真理：委曲求全、逆来顺受，让敌人掐住脖子而不敢还手，希望敌人发善心而不斗争，是死路一条；反之昂首挺胸、勇敢反抗，不是低声下气地向敌人乞怜，而是用铁拳回击，才是活路。
    《卡塞的怒吼》只是斗争的开始，虽未取得彻底的胜利，却使人们明确了生存的路。后来革命的烈火更熊熊地燃烧起来，由于取得党的领导，使群众的斗争由自发到自觉，由找不到出路到节节胜利。不屈的猴场的人民，终于看到了《小“王朝”的末日》。黑夜过去了，新时代的曙光照射到了这里。
    时代的车轮继续滚动着，革命不断向前发展。在新的历史时期里，又开始了一场新的斗争，这就是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。这斗争是尖锐的，复杂的。它在《挡不住的洪流》里得到了深刻的反映。经过土地改革、镇压反革命等运动，恶霸地主被消灭了。但残存的地主富农分子总在暗地里进行破坏活动。像谢少清，这个当过伪甲长、连长、受过人民法院制裁的坏家伙，反动的心就一直没死。他煽动落后的社员闹事，拉拢糊涂动摇的干部，诬害坚强的领导骨干，挑拨中农贫农的关系，并且组织匪徒武装向人民政府进攻。他的罪恶活动，虽然也引起了一阵风波，但那是容易被打垮和平息的。从某种意义上说，在两条道路上，对以少数富裕中农为代表的资本主义自发势力的斗争，较之对少数坏分子的斗争，是更为严重和艰巨的任务。《挡不住的洪流》的可贵之处，正是没有停留在一般的敌我矛盾的反映上，而是深入挖掘，从生活中提炼了一系列的艺术形象，全面地表现了这一时期阶级斗争的面貌。有对受了资本主义思想严重影响的贫农的斗争，有对犯右倾错误的干部的斗争，更主要的是对各种各样的走资本主义道路的自发势力代表人物的斗争。书中写下了十几个这样的人物形象，他们各有特点，但在其特征里无不渗透着共同的阶级本质。《草苗争长》中的王绍华，是个投机取巧、精明能干的人，他一心想做生意发财；
  《“万能人”入社》中的罗华明，号称“万能人”，有一身的本事，不光种庄稼是把好手，而且
  “年轻时学得许多手艺，既是木匠，又是铁匠、石匠”。同时儿子、媳妇、姑娘、也都精壮能干；而《老魔公改行》中的老魔公，又是一副面貌，他靠求神送鬼就能换得吃喝，好吃懒做，庄稼活都叫女人干。这三个人的性格和思想面貌很不相同，但一致的是都不愿意走合作化的道路，以自己的特点作为抗拒社会主义改造的盾牌。也有这样的人，并不是顽固地坚持走资本主义道路，甚至随大流入了社，但总是动动摇摇，一遇机会还跟着富农兴风作浪，《耕牛入社的风波》中的吴照明就是这样。《风浪》中的狄官福、狄光耀，则又是一种情况。狄官福曾受过伪乡、保长的欺压，因而清匪反霸、斗争地主他很积极，当了农会主席、乡干部。但慢慢地革命热情不如先前高涨了。加之身为族长的受人尊重的地位，养成了唯我独尊，自以为是，爱人奉承，厌恶批评的坏作风，于是渐渐地离开了政治，离开了党，而差点被坏分子拉下泥坑。狄光耀，开初革命也很积极，是土地改革时的村长。因为土地改革给他带来的利益不大，工作就敷敷衍衍了，抛开革命寻求发家致富之道，结果被反革命分子拉向反动……对这些人物形象，我们不应该只看到一个个单独存在的意义，而应该把他们看做一个整体，从总体上认识它，才能理解农村的阶级斗争是何等的复杂艰巨。在一部公社史里能够如此真实而深刻地反映自发势力代表人物的精神面貌，是非常可贵的。
    二
    《挡不住的洪流》不仅对形形色色的资本主义自发势力代表人物进行了生动的艺术描绘，更主要的是刻划了许多性格鲜明的社会主义革命的猛士、闯将，李和清、伍石宝、谢老四等等都是代表人物。《激流》中的伍平安，《风浪》中的谢顺舟都写得栩栩如生，突出地表现了他们优秀崇高的思想品质。这一切，有力地表明了党的领导对社会主义革命的决定意义，显示了社会主义力量的强大。因此尽管经过严重的斗争，猴场人民还是很快地由互助组走上了农村社会主义革命的大道。
    1958年，我国人民获得了建设社会主义的三大法宝，现实变的格外光辉灿烂。这部公社史以彩笔描绘了大跃进的图景，表现了人民群众高涨的共产主义热情，歌颂了三面红旗的伟大胜利。
    在大跃进中间，像全中国一样，猴场人民公社发生了翻天复地的变化。这儿过去是阴云密布、烽火满山，现在银光辉映，炉火熊熊；
  “从来不知道毛铁是树上长的呢，还是土里生的”人，现在修起了自己的高炉，世世代代刀耕火种用着粗钝的镰刀锄头，现在自己制造起播种机、插秧机来了，……
    现实是人改变的，人在改造现实的过程中也改造着自己。因而革命的深入，最深刻地体现在人物精神面貌的变化上。《挡不住的洪流》生动地反映了这种变化。韦鸦别的儿子韦昌禄没有继承父亲的懦弱性格，而成为党的精明能干的干部，父子俩相差悬殊的精神面貌，反映着不同的两个时代。广大群众不再是那样拘谨保守，而是高扬着革命的热情，意气风发地劳动着创造着。这部公社史刻划的许多形象都是活灵活现可敬可爱的。像《炉火红心》中的罗小三，胸膛里真是跳动着一颗红通通的心。他忘我劳动，敢想敢干，由一个炼铁门外汉锻炼成不断
  革新创造的炉师，由一个普通的农民成长为出
  色的炼铁厂厂长。特别令人兴奋的是，刚解除束缚的妇女，在各个平凡的岗位上，都闪耀出照人的光辉。像《姑嫂之间》里的韦金妹，谦虚恳直又宽厚，她那高涨的劳动热情和顽强的
  毅力更是感人。月亮没落就下地割秧青，看到犁田缺人就自动学犁田。犁田不仅是沉重的劳动，而且当地还有着“姑娘犁田，天旱三年”的迷信观念。她既不怕艰苦，也不受旧传统的束缚，决心学会犁田。《韦妈妈》中的罗么妹的事迹也很动人。她是公社托儿所的保育员，人们却尊称为韦妈妈。她耐心地勤恳地做着盘儿抱女、洗屎洗尿的工作，爱别人的孩子胜过爱自己的，工作忙的时候宁肯让自己的孩子哭也要把别人的孩子照顾得好好的。托儿所孩子增加了，被子不够盖，她主动地把自己“土改”分到的一直没舍得盖的好棉被拿来了。从这些行动上，我们看到她身上迸放的正是金灿灿的新思想的火花。这儿谈到的先进人物，只是例子而已。在波澜壮阔的革命运动中，先进人物并不止一个两个，而是成千上万。这部公社史努力表现的正是劳动者的光辉群像。《协作曲》
  《红旗儿女》中描述的青年一代，全都是朝气蓬勃，充满革命的英雄主义和革命的乐观主义精神。这一系列光辉的劳动人民形象，明确地告诉了我们，谁是我们时代的英雄。
    人与人之间，特别是民族之间的关系也发生了根本的变化。解放前，由于统治阶级的压迫歧视和挑拨离间，造成了各民族间的猜疑和仇恨；解放后，在党和毛主席的教导下，人们真正懂得了万恶的旧社会制度是造成民族矛盾纠纷的根本原因。在共产主义思想的基础上，各族人民建立起崭新的友好关系。《亲人》这篇作品，通过郑志华和班六妹这两个劳动妇女在协作劳动中由陌生到了解、到产生母女般感情的描述，生动地表现了汉、苗两族人民关系的变化。这种民族关系的变化，是社会主义革命的成果，是党的伟大民族政策的胜利。
    《挡不住的洪流》是一幅光辉的历史画卷，它描绘了猴场人民三十年的生活斗争和多方面的变化。从这幅画卷里，我们看到猴场人民在党的领导下艰苦奋斗、不断革命，由奴隶变成主人，由地狱走上天堂，由落后跃为先进，而且继续不断地跃进，因而我们说，《挡不住的洪流》是猴场人民的斗争史、成长史、创业史、跃进史。
    《挡不住的洪流》虽然是猴场人民公社史，但从某些方面说，它又是我国许多人民公社的共同历史，是我国农民斗争历史的缩影。它以活生生的史实展示了我国广大农民共同体验到的真理：只有依靠党的领导，只有不断斗争，才能获取胜利；三面红旗，是胜利的旗帜、幸福的旗帜；还无可辩驳的表明劳动人民是历史的创造者，是历史的主人。毫无疑问，这部公社史对我们每个人都是很好的生活教科书。
    我们的敌人和右倾机会主义分子，对三面红旗极尽诬蔑毁谤之能事。这部公社史给予了有力的批驳。铁的历史是最有权威的发言人，它告诉我们劳动人民多么急切地渴望改变“一穷二白”的面貌，走过了多长艰险崎岖的路才踏上人民公社这个“金桥”。他们正通过这个“金桥”向理想的天堂跃进，那是谁也阻挡不住的。在党的领导下，六亿人民走社会主义道路的决心所汇成的洪流，是挡不住的洪流，它不断冲决一切障碍，在我国广阔的社会主义的河床上，永远滚滚奔腾……
    三
    公社史应该主要写些什么？曾经有些人不太清楚。有些公社史或罗列数字或从生活现象上表现解放前的苦难和解放后的幸福，这是必要的，但仅限于此，就很不够了。这只能表明时代变化的某些表征，而不能揭示历史是如何变化和发展的。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”①公社史就是阶级斗争史，所以公社史主要的是写阶级斗争。反映一定时代的主要矛盾，揭示矛盾的实质和斗争发展的前途。要反映得正确深刻，必须站在无产阶级立场上，必须富有革命的理想，充分认识劳动人民在斗争中所占的重要地位，歌颂先进人物、先进思想，批判反动阶级、反动思想。《挡不住的洪流》正是遵循着毛泽东同志的教导而实践的产物，因而获得很大成就，深刻地再现了历史发展的本质面貌。
    与内容有关的是公社史应该如何写？即主要的是写人还是写事？《挡不住的洪流》在这点上提供了很好的艺术经验。它是以人物为中心，将人物的刻划和历史事件的叙述有机地交织在一起。没有让史实淹没人物性格，也不像小说似地虚构情节从多方面表现人物精神面貌，它是让人物置身在尖锐的矛盾冲突中显现他的思想性格，并辅之以必要的概括介绍和细节描写。写人物，创造先进人物的典型形象，是文学发挥作用的主要手段，因而是文学创作的重要任务。公社史应该也完全能够担负起这个任务。作为一种文学样式的公社史和一般的历史著作是不同的。它主要的不是靠数字靠抽象说理，而是靠真实的历史图景、活生生的人物形象去感染人教育人。因此，我认为，公社史把人物——主要是劳动人民中的先进人物，放在中心位置写是正确的，是值得提倡的好方法。以为写人就妨碍写史的看法未免片面。人和史不能分开，史既然是人和人的阶级斗争，那么人就要在史中来表现，写史就要写人的活动。只有抓住阶级斗争中的典型生活事件，才能有力地表现人物；也只有画出了活的人物，才能更真实更深刻地写出历史。这本书所取得的成就，充分地证明了这一点。
    在艺术上，这本书许多方面都显示了自己的特色。刻划人物的手法多种多样：有的通过人物行动的描写表现性格，有的着重内心的揭示；有的完全是白描手法，有的又借用环境气氛的烘托；有的放置在矛盾的尖端大斧砍削，有的通过日常生活事件精雕细琢。对于一个人物，有时用一种手法，更多的是多种结合使用。《红旗儿女》中的曾正品就是在尖锐的矛盾冲突中显示了自己的性格特征的。他一个人一架水车，一口气车了半天，面不红气不喘；队里又高又大的烈性马肚皮生了疮，需要上药，它又踢又跳没法接近，可是曾正品瞅机会扑过去一抱抱住了它的两只后腿，这才上了药；又一次山洪暴发，几尺高的咆哮翻腾的黄浪一下子把水车冲走了，曾正品立即跳下水里，浪头淹没了他，人们正为他的安全担心，他却抱着水车露出了水面。只这几个情节，就使这位身强力壮、勇猛无畏、积极热情的青年农民的形象站立了起来。而在《激流》里，对社长伍平安则很注重内心活动的揭示。依靠这多样化的描写手法，使人物的刻划丰富多采：有的粗犷遒劲，有的委婉多姿，从而增加了艺术的感人力量。
    创造群众喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派的作品，毛泽东同志这一指示，本书编写者开始就作为努力的目标。在实践中又贯彻了和群众相结合的原则，因而取得了显著的成绩。这最突出地表现在语言上。文学是语言的艺术，一些成功的作品，都必须具有准确、鲜明、生动的语言。但是，这种语言从何而来呢？毛泽东同志教导我们：人民群众中有无限丰富的文学矿藏，一切优秀的作品，都是对群众生活作了艰苦挖掘的结果，当然语言也不能例外。据了解，在《挡不住的洪流》的写作过程中，曾经开展了反对“知识分子腔”运动，提倡向群众学习生动、优美的语言。他们为了保证作品的口语化，一般是多采用第一人称的写法。在整理出作品后，又念给群众听，反复修改，直至达到群众喜闻乐见而后止。正是经过了这种艰苦努力，才使这部人民公社史的语言具有了朴实、鲜明、生动的特点，透出了泥土的清香。通俗而不拙劣，朴实而不粗俗，往往是一句生动形象的语言，活画出人物的一种性格；常常是一个巧妙的比喻，清点出人物的面貌。恰如本书作者在《编写经过》中说的：“群众的语言和对人物、事件的描绘，我们坐在屋子里一辈子也想不出。”这真是从实践中体会到的真理。当然，艺术不等于生活，口头语言也不尽是纯洁优美的文学语言，还必须经过加工提炼，去掉灰尘，使语言闪出光彩来。我认为，《挡不住的洪流》的语言成就，在于既保持了群众语言的特色，又是加工过的，既纯朴又不斑驳，读起来轻松晓畅，有声有色。人物的对话，在作品中是十分重要的，要写得独具个性，必须付出艰苦的劳动，本书在这方面也是较成功的，绝大部人物的语言，显示了人物的个性，而且写得又极简洁。这种成功的语言，对作品的思想性以及人物的刻划，都发挥了积极的作用。《挡不住的洪流》生动地告诉我，准确、鲜明、生动的语言在人民群众中，人民群众是真正的语言大师，应该遵照毛主席的教导，永远向人民群众学习！
    我又认为，公社史的地方特色，是写作中应该特别注意的问题之一。《挡不住的洪流》较其他已出版的公社史，在这方面有更突出的成就。另外，结构比较严密完整，以阶级斗争的历史发展为红线，很好地把表现多方面生活的单独篇章贯穿起来。从1930年以来，这个地区的重大革命事件都得到了反映。各个时期，又注意描绘全貌。比如写人民公社成立以后这个时期，围绕着公社的成立，描写了生产的发展，精神面貌的变化，旧习俗的改变，生活福利的改善等等。不同侧面的画幅共同组成了完整的大跃进时代的壮丽图景。这样，把“线”和
  “面”很好地结合了起来。使我们既看到了历史发展的脉络，也了解到一个时期的各个方面。
    《挡不住的洪流》这些成功的艺术经验，值得重视，因为它对公社史的发展和提高有很大意义。
    从以上的分析可以知道，规模宏伟的《挡不住的洪流》，内容丰富深刻，艺术上也有独特的成就。我们高兴地看到，短短的两年时间，公社史这棵新苗已经叶繁花茂、果满枝头，可以断言，今后会更茁壮地成长，越来越明显地显示出它的强大的生命力和独立存在的价值。到完全由劳动人民自己来写的时候，它会更深刻、更完美、更动人，会涌现出更多的光辉壮丽的历史画卷。
    《挡不住的洪流》是一部真正的群众创作，参加创作的有一千多人。这说明“我国的文学艺术，已经成为劳动人民的群众性的事业”。②记录整理者大都是中学程度的人，文化水平不高，创作经验也少，但由于坚持了党的领导，贯彻和劳动群众相结合的原则，大搞群众运动，发挥集体智慧，经过不倦的努力，终于写出了这部优秀的作品。这是党的文艺路线的又一次胜利，是毛泽东文艺思想的又一次伟大的胜利。
