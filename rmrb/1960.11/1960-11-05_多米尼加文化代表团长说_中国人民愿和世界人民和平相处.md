    多米尼加文化代表团长说
    中国人民愿和世界人民和平相处
    参加中华人民共和国建国十一周年庆祝活动的多米尼加文化代表团团长胡安·杜古德雷在离开北京前接见新华社记者的时候说，中国人民建设社会主义的热情给他深刻的印象。
    胡安·杜古德雷说：中国人民在短短时间内已取得了工业、农业、文化教育以及卫生等方面的巨大成绩。在中国已没有失业的现象。人民的文化生活丰富多采，人们不会找到一个要拿别人的劳动果实为自己发财致富的人。中国人民是完全自由的。只有剥削劳动人民的自由是被禁止的。
    他认为，中国人民是愿意和全世界人民和平相处的。他说，他这个信念是建筑在中国人民为保卫世界和平所作出的一系列重大贡献的基础上的。
