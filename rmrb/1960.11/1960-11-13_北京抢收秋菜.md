Xinhua News Agency report: Beijing is currently in the autumn vegetable harvest season, and the people of Beijing are actively rushing to harvest, transport, and store autumn vegetables. In recent days, trucks, horse-drawn carts, flatbed carts, bicycles, and tricycles loaded with autumn vegetables have been streaming from the suburbs to the city. The vegetable distribution stations throughout the city are quickly distributing the transported cabbage and radishes to each household and unit, and residents are busy storing, pickling, or drying them.

In order to harvest and store a large number of autumn vegetables before the frost, the people's communes, production brigades, and production teams in the suburbs have established autumn vegetable harvesting and transportation headquarters at all levels. Government offices, military units, schools, factories, enterprises, and urban people's communes have also organized forces to help with harvesting and transporting in the countryside. Since November 5th, 100,000 people have been participating in vegetable harvesting and transportation work every day. The Beijing Railway Bureau has freed up baggage cars to form four vegetable-carrying trains, supporting vegetable transportation day and night. The 117 autumn vegetable purchase collection points in the remote suburbs, the 18 railway collection and transportation stations, and the 700 unloading points in the city are working together to implement relay transportation, so that long-distance and short-distance, loading and unloading, and transportation are closely linked, thus reducing the time for loading a truckload of cabbage from three hours to one hour.

This year's autumn vegetables, in addition to being stored by the suburban people's communes and commercial departments, are also being stored in a decentralized manner and managed by the masses. Citizens have come up with various ways to store autumn vegetables. Many residents with spare land have dug vegetable cellars. Collective units such as government offices, enterprises, military units, and schools have also built simple vegetable cellars. The tens of millions of catties of cabbage and radishes transported into the city every day are basically distributed and stored as soon as they arrive.

People cherish autumn vegetables very much. Every link of cutting, transporting, and distributing vegetables tries its best not to lose a single leaf. The vegetable cutting team cuts and places vegetables gently, preventing the cabbage leaves from falling off. The loading workers adopted the pagoda-style loading method, so that the cabbage loaded on the truck was neat and solid, and would not fall off even when bumping. Some autumn vegetables that are not easy to store are being pickled and dried in a timely manner.

    北京抢收秋菜
    据新华社讯  目前正是秋菜收获季节，北京市人民正在积极抢收、抢运、抢贮秋菜。几天来，从郊区开向市内的装满秋菜的汽车、马车、小平车、自行车、三轮车等，川流不息。遍布全市的街道分菜站，把运来的白菜、萝卜迅速地分送给各户各单位，居民们正忙着贮存或腌制晾晒。
    为了把大量秋菜赶在霜冻以前收好贮好，市郊各公社、生产大队和生产小队层层成立了秋菜抢收抢运指挥部。机关、部队、学校、厂矿企业和城市人民公社也分别组织力量到农村帮助抢收抢运。从11月5日起，每天都有十万人参加收菜和运菜工作。北京铁路局腾出了行李车厢，组成四列装菜列车，日夜不停地支援运菜。远郊各县的一百一十七个秋菜收购集中点、十八个火车集运站和市内的七百处卸车处，通力协作，实行接力运输，使长途和短途、装卸和运输紧密衔接，因而使每装一汽车白菜的时间由三小时缩短到一小时。
    今年的秋菜除郊区人民公社和商业部门贮存外，还实行了分散贮存、群众保管的办法。市民们想出了各种各样的办法来贮存秋菜。许多有空闲土地的居民都挖了菜窖。各机关、企业、部队、学校等集体单位，也因陋就简地构筑了菜窖。每天运进城的几千万斤白菜、萝卜，基本上已作到随到随分配随贮存。
    人们十分珍惜秋菜。砍菜、运菜和分菜等各个环节都想尽办法不丢一帮一叶。砍菜队轻砍轻放，不让白菜帮叶掉落。装车职工采用了宝塔式装车法，装上车的白菜又整齐又落实，即使颠簸也丢不下来。一些不易保存的秋菜正在及时腌制和晾晒。
