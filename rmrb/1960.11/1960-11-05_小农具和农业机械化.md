Small Farm Tools and Agricultural Mechanization
Yang Shoulin, Worker at Suzhou Yixin Daily Use Hardware Factory

The relationship between the current and the long-term, the relationship between possibility and reality, although inseparable, cannot be confused. For example, raw rice has the possibility of being cooked into rice, but it is not the same as cooked rice; to make it into cooked rice, it needs to go through a certain production process. The same principle applies to big things. It is entirely possible to realize agricultural mechanization in our country, and it is being gradually realized, but achieving complete agricultural mechanization is not something that can be done overnight. Some comrades are not very clear about this issue. They always think that agriculture is about to be mechanized, and there is no "future" in producing small farm tools. They do not realize that to achieve long-term goals, one must grasp the present and move forward step by step in a down-to-earth manner; to talk about lofty goals without grasping the present is just empty talk. Of course, grasping the present must also have lofty goals, otherwise one will become a mediocre bureaucrat.

Realizing agricultural mechanization in our country is a fundamental measure to change the backwardness of our economy. Precisely because of this, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have always attached great importance to solving this problem, and put forward the specific requirements of "small-scale solutions in four years, solutions in seven years, and large-scale solutions in ten years, counting from 1959" for realizing agricultural mechanization. Therefore, any ideas and practices that ignore agricultural mechanization are wrong. However, it must be seen that the realization of agricultural mechanization cannot be achieved all at once, and there needs to be a process to gradually achieve the goal. To achieve this goal, the most important thing is to do a good job in current production to enhance material strength. Before agricultural mechanization is realized, the tools for doing a good job in current production mainly rely on small farm tools and improved farm tools. Therefore, before agricultural mechanization is realized, small farm tools still play a significant role in agricultural production. Those who say that small farm tools are not needed seem very enthusiastic about realizing agricultural mechanization on the surface, but in essence, they are relaxing their down-to-earth efforts and passively waiting for mechanization to arrive. Moreover, even if agricultural mechanization is realized, it does not mean that small farm tools are completely unnecessary.

Our factory's main task is to produce small farm tools. Through going to the countryside to support agriculture, I have learned that manufacturing small farm tools is not without a future, but a major event in supporting agriculture currently. For example, when I went to Taicang County to support rural water conservancy construction, I personally saw that most of the tools used on the construction site were small farm tools such as iron rakes and hoes. There are agricultural machines, and the number is constantly increasing, but before industry can mass-produce agricultural machines to supply the countryside, if we do not produce small farm tools and wait for tractors, then what tools will we use for digging soil for water conservancy projects and plowing fields for planting? The last time I went to the countryside to help repair farm tools, on the first day the stove was lit, many farmers brought a lot of small farm tools to repair, and they wanted them to be repaired as soon as possible because they were urgently needed. These situations show that the idea that small farm tools are not needed and that producing small farm tools has no future is fundamentally untenable. The needs of more than 500 million farmers cannot be ignored by anyone. Producing good small farm tools and repairing good small farm tools is a strong support for agriculture and prepares material conditions for actively realizing agricultural mechanization. We should produce whatever agricultural production needs and actively promote the development of agricultural production. With the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, the material foundation will become more and more solid, so that agricultural mechanization can arrive faster.

    小农具和农业机械化
    苏州市益新日用五金厂工人　杨寿林
    一件事情的当前和长远之间的关系，可能性和现实性之间的关系，尽管不能分割，但也不能混为一谈。譬如生米，它有煮成熟饭的可能，但不等于就是熟饭；要使它成为熟饭，还需要经过一定的制作过程。大的事情也是同样道理。实现我国的农业机械化是完全可能的，而且正在逐步实现，但要实现完全的农业机械化又不是眼前一朝一夕的事情。而对这个问题，有些同志的认识还不是很清楚的。他们总认为农业快要机械化了，生产小农具没有什么“出息”。他们不认识，凡事要达到长远的目的，必须抓住当前，踏踏实实地一步一步地前进；离开了抓当前，谈什么远大目标，就只是一种空谈。当然，抓住当前，还必须有远大的目标，否则就要变成庸庸碌碌的事务主义者。
    实现我国农业机械化，是改变我国经济落后面貌的一个根本措施。正因为如此，党中央和毛主席从来就很重视这个问题的解决，并为实现农业机械化提出了“从1959年算起，四年小解决，七年中解决，十年大解决”的具体要求。因此，任何忽视农业机械化的想法和做法都是不对的。但是必须看到，实现农业机械化，并不是一下子就能办到的，需要有一个过程，要逐步地达到目的。为要达到这个目的，最主要的是必须把当前生产搞好，以增强物质力量。而在农业机械化没有实现以前，搞好当前生产的工具，主要还是依靠小农具和改良农具。因此，在实现农业机械化之前，小农具对农业生产仍然起着很大的作用。那种说小农具不需要了的人，表面上看来似乎很热心于实现农业机械化，实质上却是放松了脚踏实地地努力，消极等待机械化的到来。何况，即使实现了农业机械化，也并不是完全不用小农具。
    我们厂的主要任务是生产小农具。我通过下乡支援农业，了解到制造小农具并不是没有出息，而是当前支援农业的大事情。例如，我到太仓县去支援农村水利建设时，就亲眼看到工地上用的工具大部分还是铁耙、锄头一类的小农具。农业机器是有的，而且数量在不断增加，但在工业还不能大量生产农业机器供给农村之前，如果就不生产小农具，等待拖拉机，那么水利工程要挖土，种田要翻地，用什么工具呢？前次我到农村去帮助修理农具时，第一天炉灶刚生火，就有许多农民拿了不少小农具来修理，而且要求越快越好，因为急等着要用。这些情况说明，认为小农具不需要了，生产小农具没有出息等等，都是根本站不住脚的。五亿多农民的需要，是谁也不能忽视的。我们生产好小农具、修理好小农具，就是对农业的有力的支援，正是为积极实现农业机械化准备物质条件。我们应当做到农业生产需要什么就生产什么，积极促进农业生产的发展。随着农业生产的持续跃进，物质基础就越来越雄厚，这样才能使农业机械化加快到来。
