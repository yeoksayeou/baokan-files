Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 15th: Farmers in Hunan Province are enthusiastically selling grain to the state. According to recent statistics, fifteen counties (cities) in the province, including Shaoyang, Shuangfeng, Dongkou, Longhui, Ningyuan, and Changning, have already completed this year's grain purchase plan ahead of schedule.

The characteristics of this year's grain purchase work in Hunan Province are overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, weighing and warehousing, and dedicated storage, grasping both the state's grain purchase work and earnestly helping the people's communes' production brigades (basic accounting units) to do a good job in grain storage and safekeeping. On the basis of carefully verifying output and reasonably stipulating grain retention standards, the food grain, seeds, and fodder grain are uniformly arranged and distributed at one time. In order to do a good job in grain storage, Party committees at all levels mobilized the masses to build and expand a number of granaries simply and practically before storage. Each production brigade generally has three to six warehouses. At the same time, a large number of weighing and acceptance personnel and grain keepers have been trained. Therefore, this year the "weighing and warehousing, dedicated storage, dedicated personnel responsible, and separate (use) accounting" method has been generally implemented for grain entering storage, basically achieving clear records of entry and exit, clear inventory, clear assets, and planned grain use.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th: The autumn grain purchase and storage movement in rural Jiangsu Province is in full swing. Now, more than ten counties in the province, including Taicang, Haimen, and Suining, have completed the early and mid-autumn grain purchase tasks, and some communes have completed the annual grain purchase tasks.

In the grain purchase movement, all localities have tightly grasped the link of weighing and warehousing, and after the harvested grain is accepted, weighed, and registered, it is sent to the state granaries and the production brigade's warehouses for storing grain, seeds, and fodder, and a "three-way combination" system of brigades, teams, and commune members is established for keeping grain, seeds, and fodder, and stored separately according to variety. Through grain weighing and warehousing, the interests of the state, the collective, and individuals are further rationally arranged, the distribution policy is better implemented, and the commune members' living arrangements are more practical, which is warmly supported by the majority of commune members.

In the process of weighing and warehousing grain, all localities have established a strict system of responsibility for weighing and acceptance, and elected cadres from the production brigades and teams, as well as representatives of commune members, to be present at the head of the field to jointly be responsible for recording, marking, acceptance, and weighing, so as to ensure that the accounts are clear and accurate.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 15th: While harvesting, threshing, and arranging living arrangements, the people's communes in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are enthusiastically selling grain to the state. In this year's grain purchase work, all localities have combined purchase and distribution, and generally achieved weighing and warehousing. Not only is the grain sold to the state weighed before entering storage throughout the region, but also the grain retained by the communes' production brigades (including food grain, fodder, seeds, and reserve grain) is all weighed before entering storage, and a grain warehouse storage, management, and withdrawal system is established to better arrange the lives of commune members.

In order to ensure the quality of the grain sold, the communes in various localities ensure that it is winnowed, screened, and dried to meet the state's purchase specifications. More than 90% of the sorghum and corn purchased and stored by the Tongliao City Grain Warehouse in Jerim League are first and second-class grain. Now, eight banners and counties and eighty-five communes in the region have completed their sales tasks.

Grain purchase stations in various localities have simplified purchase procedures, reformed tools for weighing and unloading grain, and shortened the waiting time for commune members to deliver grain. Many grain depot purchase stations have established temporary canteens, tea reception stations, and medical stations to ensure that commune members who come to sell grain have food, drink, and are not exposed to cold.

    征购分配全面安排过秤入仓斤斤落实
    湖南、江苏、内蒙古一批县市完成粮食征购任务
    据新华社长沙15日电　湖南省农民踊跃向国家交售粮食，据最近统计，全省已有邵阳、双峰、洞口、隆回、宁远、常宁等十五个县（市）提前完成了今年粮食收购计划。
    今年湖南省粮食收购工作的特点是统筹兼顾，全面安排，过秤入库，专仓保管，既抓国家粮食收购工作，也认真帮助各人民公社生产大队（基本核算单位）做好粮食入库保管工作。各地在认真核实产量和合理规定留粮标准的基础上，将口粮、种子、饲料粮统一布置，一次安排下去。为做好粮食入库工作，在入库前各级党委发动群众因陋就简地新建和扩建了一批粮仓，每个生产大队一般都有三到六处仓库。同时，各地还训练出大批过秤验收人员和粮食保管员。因此今年入库粮食普遍推行了“过秤入库、专仓保管、专人负责、分别（用途）立账”的办法，基本上做到出入有据、存粮有数、家底清楚、用粮有计划。
    据新华社南京15日电　江苏省农村的秋粮收购和入库运动正在全面展开。现在全省已有太仓、海门、睢宁等十多个县完成了早、中秋粮食征购任务，并有部分公社完成了全年粮食征购任务。
    在粮食征购运动中，各地都紧紧抓住了过秤入仓这一环节，把收获起来的粮食，验收、过秤、登记以后，分别送入国家粮仓和生产大队储存粮食、种子和饲料的仓库，建立了由大队、小队和社员“三结合”的保管粮食、种子和饲料的制度，按品种分仓保管。通过粮食过秤入仓，进一步合理地安排了国家、集体、个人的利益，更好地贯彻了分配政策，社员生活安排更加落实，得到广大社员的热烈拥护。
    在粮食过秤入仓过程中，各地都建立了严格的过秤验收责任制度，并推选出生产大队和小队干部以及社员代表到场头共同负责记账划码，验收过秤，做到账目清楚，一笔不错。
    据新华社呼和浩特15日电　内蒙古自治区各地人民公社，在秋收中边拉、边打、边安排生活的同时，向国家踊跃交售粮食。各地在今年的粮食征购工作中，都把征购和分配结合进行，同时普遍做到过秤入仓。全区不仅是交售给国家的入库粮都经过过秤，各地公社生产大队的自留粮（其中包括口粮、饲料、种子和储备粮），在入仓以前也全都过了秤，并且建立了粮食仓库保管、支取制度，把社员生活安排得更好。
    为保证交售粮食的质量，各地公社都做到扬净、筛净、晒干，符合国家收购规格。哲里木盟通辽市粮食仓库收购入库的高粱、玉米90％以上都是一、二等粮。现在全区已有八个旗县、八十五个公社完成了交售任务。
    各地粮食收购站都简化了收购手续，改革过秤、装卸粮食工具，缩短社员送粮等候时间。许多粮库收购站建立了临时食堂，茶水接待站，医疗站，以保证来交售粮食的社员有吃、有喝、不受冷冻。
