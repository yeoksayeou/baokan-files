Xinhua News Agency, Paris. The automobile manufacturing industry, one of France's most important industrial sectors, saw its production decrease by 10% in the month of October.

According to figures released by the French Automobile Manufacturers Committee on the 18th, the total output of all types of automobiles in France in October was 112,856 vehicles, a decrease of nearly 15,000 vehicles compared to September. Among these, the reduction in the production of small cars, which form the mainstay of French automobile production, reached over 12,000 vehicles.

The reason for the decline in French automobile production is mainly due to the shrinking of exports. The main market for French automobiles is abroad, but since March of this year, French automobile exports have been in the doldrums. This is mainly because of fierce competition in the United States, the main market for French small cars. In the past, small cars produced by France and other Western European countries were popular with American consumers due to their small size and fuel efficiency. This attracted the attention of American monopoly capital. Since the beginning of this year, they have strengthened their competition with Western European automakers in this area, resulting in a narrowing of the sales of small cars from France and other Western European countries in the United States. There are reports that some French small cars shipped to the United States for sale have even had to be shipped back due to lack of sales.

    法国汽车工业10月份减产百分之十
    据新华社巴黎电　法国重要的工业部门之一汽车制造工业的产量在10月份一个月中减少了10％。
    据法国汽车工业联合会18日公布的数字，10月份法国各种汽车的总产量是十一万二千八百五十六辆，比9月份减少了将近一万五千辆。其中作为法国汽车生产的主体的小汽车减产达一万二千辆以上。
    法国汽车之所以减产，主要是由于出口萎缩。法国汽车的主要销路是国外市场，但是从今年3月以来，法国汽车出口就一蹶不振。这主要是因为在法国小汽车的主要市场——美国遭到猛烈的竞争。过去法国和西欧其他国家生产的小汽车由于体型较小、省油，深得美国消费者欢迎。这就引起了美国垄断资本的注意。今年以来，它们在这方面加强了同西欧汽车商的竞争，从而使法国及西欧其他国家的小汽车在美国销路日窄。有消息说，运往美国销售的一些法国小汽车由于没有销路甚至不得不原船运回。
