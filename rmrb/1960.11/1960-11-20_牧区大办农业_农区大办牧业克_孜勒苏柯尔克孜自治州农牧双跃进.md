    Pastoral Areas Vigorously Develop Agriculture, Agricultural Areas Vigorously Develop Animal Husbandry
    Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture Achieves Double Leap Forward in Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
    (Reported by our newspaper) Under the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation and developing both agriculture and animal husbandry simultaneously, the Kizilsu Kirgiz Autonomous Prefecture in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has fully utilized the enormous superiority of the people's communes, with communes and production teams in pastoral areas vigorously developing agriculture, and each commune in agricultural areas establishing livestock farms, resulting in a double leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production across the autonomous prefecture. This year, all eleven people's communes in pastoral areas have achieved self-sufficiency in grain, and seven people's communes in agricultural areas have witnessed a significant increase in animal husbandry production. This marks the end of the historically backward agricultural situation in pastoral areas and the slow development of animal husbandry production in agricultural areas, ushering in a new chapter in the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in the autonomous prefecture.
    After the people's communes were established throughout the prefecture in 1958, the people's commune system fundamentally changed the past scattered and single-operated animal husbandry production, opening up broad avenues for the autonomous prefecture to accelerate the development of agriculture and animal husbandry through the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry. In 1959, after communization, all eleven pastoral communes in the prefecture, while developing animal husbandry, transferred about 50% of their labor force to form specialized agricultural production teams, vigorously reclaiming wasteland and cultivating land. The sown area increased from more than 70,000 mu in 1958 to more than 100,000 mu. This year, on the basis of consolidating livestock herds and rationally arranging grasslands, pastoral communes generally established year-round canteens with livestock groups, further saving a large amount of labor from animal husbandry and投入（投入：put into） into agricultural production, setting off a high tide of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. Aheqi County (pastoral area) newly built and renovated more than 300 large and small channels, increasing the irrigated area by more than 46,000 mu, expanding the sown area by more than 40% this year. In Wuqia County on the Pamir Plateau, the area of grain crops increased from more than 28,000 mu last year to more than 62,000 mu this year, more than doubling. The total output of wheat and highland barley has greatly increased compared with last year, enabling the sowing area of pastoral communes to reach an average of more than five mu per person, exceeding the level of agricultural areas, and achieving self-sufficiency in grain for each commune for the first time in history. Tuoyun Commune, located in a high and cold mountainous area, sold more than 30,000 jin of surplus grain after retaining enough rations and some feed for its more than 2,800 people.
    The rapid development of agricultural production has enabled the broad masses of people's communes in pastoral areas to embark on a new stage of integrating agriculture and animal husbandry and achieving an all-round leap forward. Since the pastoral areas have achieved self-sufficiency in grain, the past situation of relying on selling a large number of livestock to exchange for grain and slaughtering a large number of livestock for consumption every year has been fundamentally changed (according to the statistics of Aheqi County, the number of livestock sold and slaughtered in the county before communization accounted for 20.39% of the total number of livestock, while it only accounted for 2.13% in 1959), thus ensuring the rapid development of animal husbandry. In the past two years since communization, the total number of livestock in the eleven pastoral communes in the prefecture has increased from less than 300,000 heads at the end of 1958 to more than 470,000 heads, an average annual increase of more than 25%, which is about twice the average annual growth rate before communization. With the great development of grain production, Wuqia County increased the amount of feed left for livestock this year from more than 200,000 jin in the past to more than 500,000 jin. The harvest of highland barley grass and wheat straw alone reached 15 million jin. Because the farmland in pastoral areas is generally developed in river valleys with warmer climates and lower terrain, settled villages have now formed on the grasslands of pastoral areas with production teams as units. Around the villages and farmland, farmers have built tens of thousands of sheds and pens for livestock and stored a large amount of feed and fodder, which not only provides good places for livestock to spend the winter, fundamentally changing the past situation where most livestock had to be grazed in mountainous areas far away from agricultural areas in winter and spring, and often suffered heavy losses due to the inability to rescue them in time in the event of severe wind and snow, but also accumulated a large amount of high-quality fertilizer for agriculture on the spot. At present, in Wuqia and Aheqi, the two main pastoral counties of the autonomous prefecture, livestock overwintering near farmland generally account for more than 70%, providing about 300 million jin of fertilizer for agriculture, an average of more than 2,000 jin per mu, strongly supporting agricultural production.
    Each commune in the agricultural area of the autonomous prefecture has established livestock farms or established specialized livestock production teams. Each agricultural commune has fixed leaders, established a leading group for animal husbandry, and established a set of specialized animal husbandry institutions, reversing the phenomenon that only agriculture was taken care of in the past, but not animal husbandry. This year, the agricultural communes have also generally implemented the "three guarantees" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing production, and guaranteeing finance), the "seven determinations" (determining mating, determining pregnancy protection, determining the survival rate of young livestock, determining the mortality rate of adult livestock, determining physical fitness, determining the quantity of animal products, and determining the number of improved breeds), and a reward responsibility system in the operation of animal husbandry production, thus fundamentally changing the slow development of livestock in agricultural areas. This year, animal husbandry production in agricultural communes has shown a new atmosphere of "three highs" (high mating and conception rate, high pregnancy protection and lambing rate, and high survival rate of young livestock) and "three lows" (low abortion, low mortality, and low damage and loss).
    Now, the eighteen people's communes in the prefecture are seizing the work of winter wheat field management and ensuring the safe overwintering of livestock to realize the continued double leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production next year.

    牧区大办农业　农区大办牧业
    克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州农牧双跃进
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州，在以农业为基础，发展农业和发展牧业同时并举的方针下，充分发挥人民公社的巨大优越性，牧区公社社社队队大办农业，农区公社个个办牧场，自治州农牧业生产双双跃进。全州十一个牧区人民公社今年做到了社社粮食自给自足，七个农区公社畜牧业生产出现了大幅度增长的新局面。从此结束了历史上牧区农业落后、农区牧业生产发展缓慢的状况，揭开了自治州农牧业发展史上新的一页。
    1958年全州人民公社化以后，人民公社制度根本改变了过去分散的、单一经营的畜牧业生产状况，为自治州加速发展农牧业生产实行农牧结合开辟了广阔的道路。公社化后的1959年，全州十一个牧区公社在发展畜牧业的同时，就抽调了50％左右的劳力成立了农业生产专业队，大力开荒造田，播种面积由1958年的七万多亩增加到十万多亩。今年牧区各公社又在整顿畜群合理安排草场的基础上，一般都以畜牧小组成立了常年食堂，从牧业上又节省出大批劳力投入农业生产，掀起了大办农业大办粮食的高潮。阿合奇县
  （牧业区）新修整的大小渠道三百多条，增加灌溉面积四万六千多亩，使今年播种面积扩大了40％以上。帕米尔高原上的乌恰县，今年粮食作物面积就由去年的二万八千多亩增加到六万二千多亩，扩大了一倍多，小麦和青稞的总产量比去年有很大增长，从而使牧区公社的播种面积按人口平均达到了五亩多，超过了农业区的水平，在历史上第一次实现了社社粮食自给自足。地处高寒山区的托云公社，全社两千八百多人除留够口粮和一部分饲料外，还出卖了三万斤余粮。
    农业生产的迅速发展，使广大牧区的人民公社走上了农牧结合、全面跃进的新阶段。由于牧区粮食作到了自给，根本上改变了牧区过去年年要靠大量出卖牲畜换取粮食和大量宰杀牲畜食用的状况（根据阿合奇县的统计，公社化前全县出卖宰杀的牲畜占总头数的20.39％，1959年只占2.13％），因而保证了畜牧业的迅速发展。全州十一个牧区公社，自公社化后两年来，牲畜总头数已由1958年底的不到三十万头增加到四十七万多头，平均每年增长25％以上，比公社化前平均每年递增速度提高一倍左右。乌恰县随着粮食生产大发展，今年留给牲畜的饲料，由过去的二十多万斤增加到五十多万斤，单是可以用作饲草的青稞草和麦草就收获了一千五百万斤。因为牧区农田一般都是在气候较暖地势较低的河谷地带发展，现在牧区草原上已经形成了以生产大队为单位的定居村落，在村落农田周围，农民们为畜群搭起了成千上万的棚圈，储备了大量饲料饲草，不但为牲畜过冬提供了良好的场所，基本上改变了过去大部分牲畜冬春两季要在远离农区的山区牧放，常常由于遭遇大风雪不能及时抢救而造成大批死亡的状况，并且还就地为农业积攒大量的优质肥料。目前自治州主要牧区乌恰和阿合奇两县，冬季在农田附近过冬的牲畜一般都占到70％以上，为农业提供的肥料约三亿斤左右，平均每亩在两千斤以上，有力地支援了农业生产。
    自治州农业区各公社个个办牧场或建立了畜牧专业队。各农区公社都固定了领导，成立了畜牧业领导小组，建立起一套畜牧专业机构，扭转了过去顾了农业顾不了牧业的现象。今年农区公社在经营畜牧业生产上，还普遍实行了“三包”（即包工、包产、包财务）、“七定”（即定配种、定保胎、定幼畜成活率、定成畜死亡率、定体质膘度、定畜产品数量、定改良品种头数）、一奖的责任制度，因而基本上改变了农区牲畜发展缓慢的状况。农区公社今年畜牧业生产出现了配种受胎率高、保胎产羔率高、幼畜成活率高和流产少、死亡少、破坏丢失少的“三高”、“三少”新气象。
    现在全州十八个人民公社为实现明年农牧业生产继续双双跃进，正狠抓冬麦田间管理和保证牲畜的安全过冬的准备工作。
