Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 31st. A grand militia rally was held in Havana, the Cuban capital, and in towns across the country on October 30th. This marks the general mobilization of the Cuban militia in the face of the imminent threat of armed aggression by US imperialism.

From dawn, tens of thousands of workers, farmers, government employees, self-employed individuals, and student militia in Havana began to converge on designated locations. Meanwhile, a contingent of female militia members replaced them in guarding workplaces, offices, and all locations requiring protection.

In Havana, the militia assembled at the university sports field and at the bases of some military units. Cuban Prime Minister Castro inspected these camps, offering encouragement and issuing directives to the militia.

During the mobilization rally, trained militia battalions organized themselves into combat camps and received their issued weapons. They received instructions to take up combat positions to counter any invaders who dared to land on Cuban soil.

Armed and filled with combat enthusiasm, the militia members unanimously expressed their determination to oppose armed aggression by US imperialism and counter-revolutionaries. Gerardo Manzanet, a worker-militia member and leader of a militia combat battalion, told reporters, "We are determined to give our lives for the freedom of Cuba. Cuba is a small country, but it has already resisted a clay giant on its own territory." Raul Curbelo Morales, the Minister of Transportation, who was wearing a militia uniform and participating in training alongside the militia, said, "We should always be prepared for battle until imperialism is eliminated." Female student Natacha Santiago said, "We women have the same mental preparedness and will as men. The motherland is ours, death is for the enemy, and we will be victorious." (Attached picture)
