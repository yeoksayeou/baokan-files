Fixed Factories, Fixed Personnel, Fixed Tasks, Fixed Equipment, Fixed Supply and Sales Relationships
Nanjing and Hangzhou's Small Commodity Production Moves Towards Specialization

(Reported by this newspaper) Nanjing's small commodity production is gradually moving towards specialization by implementing fixed factories, fixed personnel, fixed tasks, fixed equipment, and fixed supply and sales relationships.

In order to stabilize the types of small commodities and the production units to a large extent, and to continuously expand the variety of designs and colors, increase output and quality, and reduce costs to better meet market needs, the Municipal Daily Industrial Products Office began in June to organize forces to conduct thorough investigations in factories and markets. They fixed the existing two hundred and fifty factories undertaking small commodity production as a specialized team for producing small commodities, and classified and arranged product plans for seasonal goods, scarce goods, and famous brand goods. The production tasks were implemented at all levels down to the factory, workshop, group, and even each worker. This not only gradually incorporated small commodity production into the plan, promoted the specialization of small commodity production, but also strengthened the responsibility system at all levels, mobilized the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers, and promoted the rapid development of small commodity production.

The implementation of "five fixings" is also conducive to adjusting the industrial layout and rationally arranging labor. For example, after the "five fixings," the Qin淮, 建邺 (Jianye), and 鼓楼 (Gulou) People's Communes organized factories with the same industry and similar products to establish specialized production bases for small commodities, small hardware, and daily miscellaneous goods. They carried out product matching and job adjustment and mergers, which not only improved production but also reduced management costs.

(Reported by this newspaper) Hangzhou has mobilized all positive factors to increase the production of small commodities. Since the third quarter, the quality, variety, and output of small commodities have increased significantly. Among them, the variety of designs and colors has increased by six hundred compared to last year; the output of one hundred and seven comparable products has increased by 68% compared to the same period last year.

Since the third quarter, the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has held several meetings on the production of small commodities. Starting from summarizing the experience of the previous stage of small commodity production, it further implemented the policy of local industry serving agriculture, serving large industry, serving the people's lives, and serving exports, so that the units producing small commodities further clarified their business direction. The urban People's Communes quickly arranged the production forces for small commodities and improved and established specialized teams. In arranging daily small commodities and repair services, the 上城 (Shangcheng) Commune made appropriate adjustments and division of labor, and implemented the "five fixings" method of fixed locations, fixed personnel, fixed equipment, fixed tasks, and fixed supply and sales relationships, so that the production tasks of small commodities were quickly implemented in the workshops and groups of one hundred and three factories. After implementing the "five fixings," the 小营巷 (Xiaoyingxiang) Hardware Factory tried every means to open up sources of raw materials and tap the potential of equipment, increasing the production of small commodities such as small springs, hidden box buckles, and key rings.

In developing small commodity production, factories in Hangzhou actively practiced increasing income and reducing expenditure and actively carried out comprehensive utilization, so as to produce more small commodities with the least amount of raw materials. According to the product structure and use, the bamboo industry arranged materials in different grades, so that the utilization rate of mao bamboo reached 96%. The employees of the Hangzhou 工农 (Gongnong) Wood Factory picked up more than 5,000 jin of scrap wood in three months and produced various small furniture.

    南京杭州小商品生产走向专业化
    本报讯　南京市小商品生产，实行定厂、定人员、定任务、定设备、定供销关系，逐步向专业化生产方向发展。
    为了使小商品生产从品种，生产单位大体上稳定下来，并且不断扩大花色品种、提高产量、质量、降低成本，更好地适应市场的需要，从6月开始，市委日用工业品办公室就组织了力量，深入到工厂、市场调查摸底，将目前已经承担小商品生产的二百五十多个工厂固定下来作为生产小商品的专业队伍，并分门别类地安排了当令货，缺门货，名牌货等产品的品种计划，把生产任务层层落实到厂、车间、小组以至每个工人。这样，不仅使小商品生产逐步纳入了计划，促进了小商品生产的专业化，并且加强了各级领导责任制，调动了广大职工的积极性，促进了小商品生产的迅速发展。
    实行“五定”生产，还有利于调整工业布局，合理安排劳力。如秦淮、建邺、鼓楼等人民公社在“五定”以后，将行业相同、产品相近的工厂组织起来，建立小百货、小五金、日用杂品等专业性的生产基地，进行了产品配套，工种调整合并，既提高了生产，又降低了管理费用。
    本报讯　杭州市调动各方面的积极因素，增加小商品生产。第三季度以来，小商品的质量、品种和产量都有了大幅度的增长。其中花色品种比去年增加了六百种；一百零七种可比产品的产量比去年同期增长了68％。
    第三季度以来，中共杭州市委多次召开小商品生产会议，从总结前一阶段小商品生产的经验入手，进一步贯彻地方工业为农业服务、为大工业服务、为人民生活服务和为出口服务的方针，使生产小商品的单位进一步明确了经营方向。各城市人民公社迅速安排了小商品生产力量，健全和建立专业队伍。上城公社在安排日用小商品和修理服务业务中进行适当调整和分工，实行了定点、定人员、定设备、定任务和定供销关系的“五定”办法，使小商品的生产任务迅速落实到一百零三个工厂的车间和小组。小营巷五金厂在实行“五定”后，千方百计开辟原料来源，挖掘设备潜力，增加了小弹簧、暗箱扣和匙圈等小商品的生产。
    杭州市各厂在发展小商品生产中，开源节流，积极开展综合利用，做到用最少的原料生产更多的小商品。竹器业根据产品结构和用途，分档安排用料，使毛竹的利用率达到96％。杭州工农木器厂职工三个月拣了五千多斤零料木材，生产了各种小家具。
