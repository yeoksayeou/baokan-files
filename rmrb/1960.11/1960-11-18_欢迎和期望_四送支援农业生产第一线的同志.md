Welcome and Expectations
    -- Sending Off Comrades to the Forefront of Agricultural Production
    Ge Song
    Recently, in many cities, one can often see teams sending off comrades who are being transferred to lower levels, and often hear the sound of gongs and drums. People are pinning big red flowers on the comrades who are going to support the forefront of agricultural production. This scene cannot help but remind people of the scenes of sending off loved ones to join the army in those years.
    These comrades being sent off, as soon as they arrive in the countryside, are immediately greeted with even more enthusiastic welcome and meticulous care by the Party and the people. That moving scene is even more impressive than in the cities, moving the welcomed comrades deeply.
    Look, this is Songjia Village in Jinxi County, Jiangxi Province, where people are welcoming Song Ximing, a high school graduate who has returned to his hometown for production. Song Shusheng, an old man in his sixties with graying temples, held Song Ximing's hand and said, "Child, you did the right thing, you are promising. Studying without forgetting your roots is the mark of a good student of Chairman Mao." Another young student, Qiao Jiguang, returned to the countryside to settle down after graduating from junior high school this summer vacation. Production team leader Zhang Choumao warmly said: "Jiguang, you made a good decision. Our team is good in every way, except that there are few people with culture. With you back, production will be even better!" Some older people also discussed: "Young people nowadays are different. They have studied for so many years and are still happy to come back to work!"
    Many communes and brigades across the country are as enthusiastically welcoming educated youth to return to their hometowns to work as Songjia Village. This shows that the Party's call is also the need of the people. People's words of welcome are addressed to specific young people who return to their hometowns, but isn't this also what the broad masses of the people are saying to every cadre sent to lower levels and every young intellectual in the country? Which young person who goes to the countryside will not hear words like "You did the right thing," "You made a good decision," "It's really good that you came back," or similar words in the countryside they arrive in? National public opinion welcomes comrades who come to the forefront of agricultural production, enthusiastically approves of their practical actions, and praises them as good sons and daughters of the Party.
    The fact that farmers welcome comrades who go to the countryside is by no means accidental. This precisely shows how much our countryside needs people, and needs young people with culture and knowledge. Farmers painstakingly raise their children to attend elementary school in their hometowns, and then send them to middle school in the county, and even to university in the province. Of course, they hope that they will not forget their roots after studying, and that they will return to contribute more and greater strength to the countryside, to agriculture, and to grain in the future.
    What do the comrades who go to the countryside think? Before going to the countryside, they have already vowed to charge forward and make great contributions to the large-scale development of agriculture and grain, and to strive to build rural people's communes. Everyone deeply recognizes that if everyone only studies and does not farm, or does not farm after studying, where will there be food to eat? Where will there be clothes to wear? Where will industrial raw materials come from? Everyone also knows that if farmers do not study or learn technology, how can agricultural production be developed? It is true that agricultural labor is still relatively arduous at present, however, advanced young people fully realize that conquering backwardness and transforming the world is the most promising thing to do; evading labor and only wanting to eat ready-made meals is the least promising thing to do. Chen Zhilun, a young farmer in Sichuan, said it well: "Although the countryside is a bit difficult now, it is precisely because of this that we revolutionaries need to bravely rush up and change it with our own hands!"
    Agricultural production is not only about dealing with soil clods, there is a lot of knowledge and creation in it. Agricultural labor is not a simple matter, because the things that people serve are all living plants, and there can be no carelessness at all. It is truly possible to learn as long as you live. As long as we love agricultural labor and have feelings for labor, we will discover many mysteries from the land, learn a lot of production knowledge, and learn a lot of knowledge that is not in books. Relatives in the countryside are expecting you, this new force, to show your skills, to combine the knowledge you have learned from books with production, to greatly promote and enrich and improve it, so that our vast and expansive homeland can change its appearance in a short period of time and say goodbye to poverty forever and finally!

    欢迎和期望
    ——四送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    最近，在许多城市里，经常可以见到欢送下放同志的队伍，经常可以听到敲锣打鼓的声音。人们给支援农业生产第一线的同志们戴上大红花，此情此景，不禁使人想起当年送亲人参军入伍的场面。
    这些被欢送的同志，一到了农村，马上又受到党和人民更热烈的欢迎和关怀备至的接待。那种动人的场面，比起城市，真是有过之无不及，使得被欢迎的同志感动不已。
    请看，这是江西省金溪县宋家村，人们在欢迎高中毕业回乡来生产的青年宋喜明。六十多岁鬓发花白的宋树生老大爷，拉着宋喜明的手说：“孩子，你做得对，有出息，读书不忘本，是毛主席的好学生。”另一个青年学生乔继光，在今年暑假初中毕业后，就背上行李，回农村安家落户。生产队长张丑卯热乎乎地说：“继光，你可打了个好主意。咱这队，什么都好，就是有文化的人少，你回来，生产就能搞得更好啦；”有些上了年岁的人，也议论说：“这会子的年轻人就不一样，念了那么多年书还乐乐和和回来劳动！”
    全国许多公社，许多大队，都像宋家村这样热烈地欢迎知识青年回乡劳动。这说明了党的号召也正是人民的需要。人们欢迎的言词是对一个个回乡的具体青年讲的，但这又何尝不是广大人民对全国每一个下放干部、每一个青年知识分子说的呢？哪一个到农村去的青年到了哪个农村，又会听不到
  “你做得对”，“你可打了个好主意”，“你回来可真好”这样的或类似的话语呢？全国的舆论都是对到农业生产第一线来的同志表示欢迎，热烈地赞成他们的实际行动，称颂他们是党的好儿女。
    农民这样欢迎到农村去的同志，这决不是什么偶然的事。这正表明了我们的农村是多末需要人，需要有文化、有知识的青年。农民千辛万苦抚养子弟在本乡上小学，又送他们到县里念中学，甚至到省里读大学，当然很希望他们读书不忘本，将来学成归来为农村、为农业、为粮食贡献出更多、更大的力量。
    到农村去的同志们怎样想呢？他们在下乡以前，已经发誓为大办农业、大办粮食打冲锋、立大功，努力建设农村人民公社。大家深深认识到，要是人人都是只读书不耕田，或读了书就不耕田，哪里有吃的呢？哪里有穿的呢？工业原料又从哪里来？大家同时也知道，要是种田人不读书、不学技术，又怎能发展农业生产？不错，农业劳动在目前还是比较艰苦的，然而，先进的青年完全认识到：战胜落后，改造世界是最有出息的；逃避劳动，专想吃现成饭是最没出息的。四川的青年农民陈志伦说得对：“现在农村虽然苦些，但正因为这样，就需要我们革命者勇敢地冲上去，动手去改变它！”
    农业生产不仅是和土坷垃打交道，这里面大有学问，大有创造。农业劳动不是简单的事，因为人们所侍候的都是有生命的植物，一点也马虎不得，真是可以做到老学到老。只要我们爱上农业劳动，对劳动有了感情，就会从土地里发现许多奥秘，学到许多生产知识，学到许多书本上没有的知识。农村的亲人们正是在期望着你们这批生力军去大显身手，使你们从书本上所学到的知识，同生产结合，大大地发扬光大，大大地丰富和提高，使我们广大辽阔的乡土，在短期内改变面貌，永远地、最后地跟贫困告别！
