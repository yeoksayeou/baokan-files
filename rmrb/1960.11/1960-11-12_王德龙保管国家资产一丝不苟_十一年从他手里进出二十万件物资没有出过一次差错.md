    Wang Delong Meticulously Guards State Assets
    Over Eleven Years, Twenty Thousand Items Passed Through His Hands Without a Single Mistake
    (Our Shanghai dispatch, November 11) Wang Delong, a fifty-eight-year-old warehouseman and Communist Party member at the Guangfu Road Warehouse First Sub-depot of the state-owned Shanghai Commercial Storage and Transportation Company, has handled the entry and exit of over two hundred thousand items in the past eleven years without a single incident of damage or spoilage, and without any errors. Wang Delong's noble character of carefully cherishing state property and his meticulous working style have become a red banner among warehousemen in Shanghai.
    Wang Delong manages two ground-floor warehouses with a total area of 1,100 square meters, which are often stacked with hundreds of tons and thousands of items. The variety and properties of the goods are complex. Taking knitted goods and stationery as examples, there are more than a thousand types. Furthermore, the "character" of each commodity is different, some are afraid of cold, some are afraid of heat, some need ventilation, and some cannot be touched. In addition, the warehouse is located on the bank of the Suzhou River, in a low-lying area prone to dampness, making it even more difficult to maintain the goods.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, the storage and transportation business of this warehouse has increased by nearly one time. However, despite the increase in tasks, the materials managed by Wang Delong have not experienced a single accident. The fundamental reason why he has been able to achieve such results is that he has a high sense of responsibility for protecting state property. He said: "The problem is not whether the work is busy or not, but whether the state's materials are seen as important or not, and whether the work is diligent or not. As long as you concentrate and are not sloppy at all, the work can be done flawlessly."
    Indeed, this is the case. Once, Wang Delong was simultaneously accepting several batches of goods. After all the goods were put into the warehouse, he discovered that a batch of underwear sent by a knitting factory only matched the item numbers and quantities, but had not verified the specifications. He immediately ran into the warehouse and carefully checked each item again, and as a result, he found an item of underwear with the same item number but different specifications, and eliminated the error in time. In mid-September this year, an electrical porcelain factory sent a batch of fuses. From the outside, the wooden boxes packaging the goods were intact and dry. According to general receiving requirements, they could be put into the warehouse without question. However, Wang Delong not only looked at the outside, but also checked every seam and every corner of the box. Sure enough, he found water marks on the seams of the wooden box. When he pried open the box, he found that the lining paper of more than four hundred items was wet, so he took appropriate measures in time. Usually, when goods arrive at the warehouse, Wang Delong must carefully check and verify the name and specifications of each item. When goods leave the warehouse, he also classifies and stacks them and counts them one by one in front of the recipient. For eleven years, he has been meticulous, strictly implementing the entry and exit warehouse system, and never allowing any goods that have not been carefully checked and inspected to slip into the warehouse or be handed over to the receiving unit.
    Wang Delong usually goes to the warehouse first thing after starting work to prepare storage space for the goods to be put in. He also finds the goods according to the outgoing orders item by item, checks the vouchers, and puts the small items in order so as not to be in a hurry at the last minute. In the evening, he re-checks the accounts and goods of the day, tidies up the goods neatly, sweeps the aisles clean, and then goes home with peace of mind. He often says: "A warehouseman who is not familiar with the warehouse situation is like a blind man touching an elephant, and cannot manage the goods well." Because of this, he knows the situation in every corner of the 1,100 square meter warehouse like the back of his hand. He knows which way the wind is blowing when it rains, which row of windows should be covered with sacks, and how big a tide will cause water to seep into that part of the floor. In order to master the performance of the goods and study maintenance work, he also asks people for advice everywhere. When workers from the ink factory send ink to the warehouse, he asks: "At what temperature below zero will the ink bottles crack?" When he encounters deliverymen from chemical factories and stencil paper factories, he asks: "Why are stencil paper and carbon paper afraid of sunlight?" "What is the reason why soap and soap powder cannot be piled together?" Sometimes, if the workers and deliverymen cannot answer, he takes the time to consult the technicians of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, which is located upstairs in the warehouse. He also insists on attending the amateur cultural classes organized by the warehouse to study culture. Because of his persistence in learning and constant research, his knowledge and experience have become richer and richer, and his work has become better and better.

### 王德龙保管国家资产一丝不苟  十一年从他手里进出二十万件物资没有出过一次差错

    王德龙保管国家资产一丝不苟
    十一年从他手里进出二十万件物资没有出过一次差错
    本报上海11日电　国营上海商业储运公司光复路仓库第一分库五十八岁的老保管员、共产党员王德龙，十一年来，他经手进出的二十多万件物资，从没有发生过一次损坏、变质事故，也没有出过差错。王德龙这种精心爱护国家财产的高贵品质和一丝不苟的工作作风，已经成为上海仓库保管员中的一面红旗。
    王德龙管理的两个底层仓库，总面积达一千一百平方米，这里经常堆放着几百吨、数千件货物。商品的品种和性能更是复杂。拿针织品、文教用品来说就有一千多种。而且商品“性格”，各有不同，有的怕冷，有的怕热，有的需要通风，有的碰不得，加上仓库在苏州河边，地势较低，易于受潮，要保管好就更不容易了。
    大跃进以来，这个仓库的储运业务增加将近一倍。可是尽管任务在增加，王德龙经管的物资，照样没有出过一次事故。他所以能够做出这样的成绩，根本原因是他具有爱护国家财产的高度责任心。他说：“问题不在于工作忙不忙，而在于把国家物资看得重要不重要。工作做得勤不勤。只要专心一志，一点不马虎，工作就可以做得万无一失。”
    事实也确是这样。有一次，王德龙同时验收几笔商品，货物全部进仓以后，发现针织厂送来的一批内衣有几件只对了货号、数目，没有核对规格。他立即跑进仓间，再逐项仔细核对，结果查出了一件货号相同、规格不符的内衣，及时消灭了差错。今年9月中旬，有一家电瓷厂送来一批熔断器，从外表看来，包装商品的木箱件件完整，只只干燥，按一般收货要求，完全可以进仓；但王德龙不单看外表，还要查看箱子的每条缝，每只角，果然在木箱拼缝处发现了水迹，撬开箱子一查，有四百多件商品的衬纸是湿的，于是及时作了妥善处理。平时，商品到库，王德龙一定要将品名、规格，细致逐项核对清楚。商品出仓，他也要分类、分堆逐件向取货人当面点清。十一年来，他就是这样一丝不苟，严格执行进出仓制度，从不肯让一件没有经过仔细核对、查验的商品，从他手里溜进仓库或交给取货单位。
    王德龙平时一上班，先到仓间，为进仓的商品准备好仓位，又根据出仓单逐项找到商品，对好凭证，并把小件货物理好、放好，免得临时手忙脚乱。晚上，他又把当天的账、货复核清楚，把商品整理得齐齐整整，走道打扫得清清爽爽，然后才放心回家。他常说：“保管员不熟悉仓间情况，就像瞎子摸象，决不能管好商品。”正因为这样，他对一千一百平方米大的仓间，各个角落的情况都摸得一清二楚。下雨时风向是那一面，那排窗子要遮上麻袋；多大的潮汛，那块地坪会渗水，他都了如指掌。为了掌握商品性能，钻研保养业务，他还到处向人请教。墨水厂工人送墨水入库，他就问：“墨水瓶到零下几度要冻裂？”碰到化工厂、蜡纸厂的送货员，他又问：“蜡纸、复写纸为什么怕见阳光？”“肥皂和肥皂粉不能堆在一起是啥道理？”有时工人、送货员答不上来，他便抽空去请教设在仓库楼上的商品检验局的技术员。他还坚持参加仓库举办的业余文化班学习文化。由于坚持学习，不断钻研，他的知识、经验就越来越丰富，工作就越做越好。
