    Realizing the Continuous Leap Forward in Pastoral Agricultural Production
    Zhao Zihe, First Secretary of the CPC Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture Committee
    The Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is located on the westernmost edge of our motherland, on the Pamir Plateau. The area is vast, the land is fertile, the pastures are wide, and the products are abundant, with enormous potential and broad prospects for developing agricultural and pastoral production. Since liberation, under the glorious illumination of the Party's ethnic policies, the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture have been working diligently to develop their economic and cultural undertakings, thereby rapidly transforming the face of the region and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups.
    After the establishment of the autonomous prefecture, the people of eleven ethnic groups, mainly the Kirghiz nationality, realized their rights to autonomy, became masters of their own affairs, and fully demonstrated their enthusiasm for carrying out socialist revolution and building a socialist motherland. In recent years, under the leadership of the autonomous prefecture Party committee, they have actively developed the cooperative movement. By 1956, all primary cooperatives had fully realized advanced cooperativization, enabling agriculture to achieve socialist transformation first. The socialist transformation of animal husbandry was carried out in conjunction with the democratic revolution. While agricultural and animal husbandry cooperativization was underway, the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce was also completed, thereby achieving victory in the socialist revolution on the economic front throughout the prefecture. Encouraged by the Party's general line for building socialism and the great leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production, the people of the prefecture quickly realized the people's commune movement in accordance with the spirit of the Party Central Committee's resolution on establishing people's communes. The establishment of this new socialist production relationship further liberated the productive forces, brought its enormous advantages into play, and, with the help of the state in various aspects such as agricultural tools, technology, and capital, promoted an even greater leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production. This year, the sown area increased by 80% compared to 1954. Since 1958, the autonomous prefecture has basically achieved self-sufficiency in grain, and is now moving towards the goal of grain surplus. In terms of animal husbandry, the net increase in livestock this year is 77.5% compared to 1954, with an average of five head of livestock per person. The fact that the construction of the autonomous prefecture has developed by leaps and bounds proves that the policy put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao of taking agriculture as the foundation, grain as the key link, and mobilizing the whole Party and all the people to engage in agriculture and grain production on a large scale is completely correct.
    To develop animal husbandry at a high speed, it is necessary to have a high-speed development of agriculture as a foundation; at the same time, the high-speed development of animal husbandry also promotes the high-speed development of agriculture. In the great leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry, we have gained a deeper understanding of this point. For example, Akqi County achieved tremendous success in agricultural and animal husbandry production in 1958 and 1959, realizing self-sufficiency in grain and feed, which enabled animal husbandry to achieve a great leap forward in these two years. The net increase rate of livestock in the county reached 28.85% in 1958; by 1959, it had surged to 43.93%. The average number of livestock per person in the county increased from three and a half in 1954 to ten and a half in 1959. In agricultural areas, large-scale development of animal husbandry can solve the problem of livestock fodder with agricultural by-products, and at the same time, high-quality fertilizer from livestock can solve the fertilizer problem in agriculture. These facts show that agriculture and animal husbandry can completely support each other and leap forward together.
    With the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production, cultural education and health undertakings have also achieved a leap forward. Before liberation, culture was backward here, and there were many illiterate people. Now there are ten middle schools, sixty-three primary schools, Party schools, scientific research institutes and technical schools, and newspapers are also published. In order to adapt to the characteristics of grazing livestock in pastoral areas, tent schools have also been established so that children of school age in the most remote areas of pastoral areas can also attend school. Eleven agricultural middle schools and red and expert schools have also been established in agricultural and pastoral areas, and amateur schools have been established universally, which has greatly improved the cultural level of cadres and the masses. 60% of the people have removed the label of illiteracy and continue to learn and improve in amateur schools. Now the autonomous prefecture not only has middle school students, but also university students, and the number of students accounts for 12.46% of the total population. Hospitals and medical stations have been established in prefectures, counties, and communes, and a large number of medical personnel have been trained. At the same time, due to the widespread establishment of canteens, the broad masses can eat well and have good nutrition, are strong, have fewer diseases, reduced mortality, and increased fertility, and the population has grown significantly. A new atmosphere of prosperity for both people and wealth, and prosperity for both people and livestock, has truly emerged.
    Since the establishment of the autonomous prefecture, we have achieved tremendous success in all aspects of our work, which has fundamentally changed the face of the autonomous prefecture, transformed the backward Kirghiz nationality into an advanced socialist nationality, and transformed the economically backward region into a prosperous socialist region. At present, our central task is to better respond to the Party's call to engage in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, to work hard in agricultural and animal husbandry production on the basis of the achievements we have made in the past, to complete the tasks of agricultural and animal husbandry production, and to strive for a continued great leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production. At the same time, we must also do a good job in industry, finance and trade, culture, education, health and other aspects of work accordingly, so that these works can better serve agricultural and animal husbandry production. In order to complete the above tasks, according to the situation of the autonomous prefecture, and based on past experience, we must earnestly do the following work:
    First, we must fully implement the policy of engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale. Engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale is the central task of the autonomous prefecture at present and in the future, and all other work must serve agricultural and animal husbandry production. Through propaganda, we must make the broad masses of cadres and the people understand that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, grain is the foundation of the foundation, and the important significance of engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, so that the broad masses of cadres can work in agricultural and pastoral areas with peace of mind, and the masses in agricultural and pastoral areas can engage in agricultural and animal husbandry production with peace of mind. To develop agricultural production, we must resolutely implement the policy of both expanding the cultivated area and increasing the yield per unit area. The cultivated area of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture is still small, and we must try every means to expand the cultivated area and strive to reach more than six mu of cultivated area per person. While expanding the cultivated area, we should attach importance to increasing the yield per unit area. Some people oppose increasing the yield per unit area to expanding the cultivated area. This view and practice are wrong. To carry out agricultural production, we must resolutely implement the policy of combining agriculture and animal husbandry. Agricultural and animal husbandry production support and promote each other. According to the situation of the autonomous prefecture, agricultural areas have good conditions for raising livestock on a large scale, and pastoral areas also have good conditions for engaging in agriculture on a large scale. Agricultural areas should raise livestock on a large scale, and pastoral areas should engage in agriculture on a large scale. Only in this way can agricultural and animal husbandry production in the autonomous prefecture support each other and leap forward together. All aspects and units should fully support agricultural and animal husbandry production. We must try every means to strengthen the labor force for agricultural and animal husbandry production, carry out a movement to save labor, and give full play to the role of the existing labor force. We must comprehensively implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, especially to build water conservancy and improve the soil. If these tasks are done well, we can promote the continued leap forward in agricultural and animal husbandry production.
    Second, strengthen national unity and give full play to the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in socialist construction. The autonomous prefecture has eleven ethnic groups, and only by establishing a new relationship of unity, friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation can we give full play to their enthusiasm for building socialism. Therefore, we must continue to publicize the Party's ethnic policies, check the implementation of ethnic policies, continue to oppose great Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and attach importance to developing Party members and establishing Party organizations among the masses of all ethnic groups, so that they can become the core of leading the masses in their struggles. In particular, we must attach importance to cultivating ethnic minority cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This is an important guarantee for strengthening national unity, establishing new ethnic relations, and enabling the masses of all ethnic groups to advance towards socialism and communism.
    Third, rely on the masses and launch mass movements. All of our work is the work of the masses, is for the benefit of the masses, and is warmly supported and actively participated in by the masses. Relying on the power of the masses, any work can be done well and any difficulties can be overcome.
    Fourth, earnestly improve the leadership style and working methods of cadres. To give full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, we must improve the leadership style and working methods of cadres. Leading cadres at the prefecture, county, and commune levels have lived, eaten, worked, and consulted with the masses in agricultural and pastoral areas for a long time, which is a great encouragement to grassroots cadres and the masses. The broad masses of grassroots cadres also consciously eat, live, work, and consult with the masses, the phenomenon of coercion and command by cadres has been overcome, and the production enthusiasm of the masses has become even higher. Leading cadres at the prefecture, county, and commune levels settle down in production brigades, take responsibility for specific areas, work for a long time, and are responsible to the end, which plays a great role in doing a good job at the grassroots level. The leadership methods of "two-five system," "three-seven system," and "fourteen-one system" that have been widely promoted throughout the prefecture have achieved good results. These good leadership styles and working methods should continue to be promoted.
    In order to ensure that the above points are achieved, one of the most fundamental issues is to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the red banners of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, and conscientiously implement the Party's various policies. Our past experience has proven that whenever we have armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and correctly used the three magic weapons of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's commune, we have been able to give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of cadres and the masses, overcome difficulties, and complete tasks.

    实现牧区农业生产的不断跃进
    中共克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州委员会第一书记　赵子和
    新疆维吾尔自治区克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州，位于祖国的最西边，在帕米尔高原之上，地区辽阔，土地肥沃，牧场宽广，物产丰富，有着发展农牧业生产的巨大潜力和广阔前途。自解放以来，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，全州各族人民，以自己辛勤的劳动，全力发展经济和文化事业，从而使这一地区的面貌和各族人民的生活迅速发生了巨大的变化。
    自治州成立以后，全州以柯尔克孜民族为主的十一个民族的人民群众，实现了自治权利，当家作主，充分发挥了他们进行社会主义革命和建设社会主义祖国的积极性。几年来，他们在自治州党委的领导下，积极发展了合作化事业。到1956年，所有初级合作社全面实现了高级合作化，使农业首先实现了社会主义改造。畜牧业的社会主义改造是和民主革命结合进行的。而在农牧业合作化的同时，也完成了手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。从而在全州取得了经济战线上的社会主义革命的胜利。由于党的建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞和农牧业生产的大跃进，全州人民根据党中央关于建立人民公社的决议的精神，迅速地实现了人民公社化。这一新的社会主义生产关系的建立，进一步解放了生产力，发挥了它巨大的优越性，又获得国家在农具、技术和资金等各方面的扶助，就促进了农牧业生产更大的跃进。到今年，播种面积比1954年增加了80％。从1958年起，自治州已经基本上实现了粮食的自给自足，现在正向着粮食有余的目标前进。在畜牧业方面，今年比1954年牲畜净增77.5％，每人平均有牲畜五头。自治州建设飞跃发展的事实证明，党中央、毛主席提出的以农业为基础，以粮为纲，全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的方针是完全正确的。
    要高速度的发展畜牧业，必须有高速度发展的农业作基础；同时，畜牧业的高速度发展，也促进了农业的高速度发展。在农牧业大跃进中，我们对这一点有了更深刻的体会。例如阿合奇县，1958年和1959年农牧业生产获得了巨大的成就，实现了粮食和饲料的自给自足，就使这两年的畜牧业实现了大跃进。该县1958年牲畜净增率达到28.85％；到1959年又剧增到43.93％。该县每人平均的牲畜由1954年的三头半，提高到1959年的十头半。在农业区，大量的发展畜牧业，可以用农业的副产品解决牲畜的饲草问题，同时，又可以用牲畜的优质肥料解决农业的肥料问题。这些事实说明，农牧业完全能够互相支援，共同跃进。
    随着农牧业生产的发展，文化教育、卫生事业也得到了飞跃的发展。解放前，这里文化落后，文盲众多，现在已有十所中学，六十三所小学，有党校，有科学研究所和技术学校，还出版了报纸。为了适应牧区牧放牲畜的特点，还建立了帐篷小学，使牧区极偏僻地区的适龄儿童，也能够入学。农牧区还建立了十一所农业中学和红专学校，普遍建立了业余学校，使干部、群众的文化水平大大提高。60％的人民已摘掉了文盲帽子，在业余学校里继续学习提高。现在自治州不但有了中学生，而且还有大学生，学生人数占到总人口的12.46％。州、县和公社，都建立了医院、医疗站，培养训练了大批医务人员。同时，由于普遍建立了食堂，广大群众能够吃饱吃好，身体强壮，疾病减少，死亡减少，生育增加，人口有了很大的增长，真正出现了人财两旺、人畜两旺的新气象。
    自治州成立以来，我们各方面的工作，都取得了巨大的成就，使自治州的面貌发生了根本的变化，使落后的柯尔克孜民族变成为社会主义的先进的民族，使生产落后的地区变成为社会主义的繁荣的地区。目前，我们的中心任务，就是要更好地响应党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召，在过去已取得的成就的基础上，全力作好农牧业生产工作，完成农牧业生产任务，争取农牧业生产继续大跃进。同时，还要相应的做好工业、财贸、文教、卫生等各方面的工作，使这些工作更好地为农牧业生产服务。为了完成以上的任务，按照自治州的情况，根据过去的经验，必须切实做好以下的工作：
    首先，全力贯彻执行大办农业、大办粮食的方针。大办农业、大办粮食是自治州当前和今后的中心任务，其他任何工作都要为农牧业生产服务。要通过宣传，使广大干部和群众都明白农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础，和大办农业、大办粮食的重要意义，使广大干部安心农牧区工作，使农牧区群众安心农牧业生产。发展农业生产，必须坚决执行扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量并举的方针。克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州耕地面积还小，一定要想尽一切办法扩大耕地面积，争取达到每人占有耕地面积六亩以上。在扩大耕地面积的同时，应该重视提高单位面积产量，有的人将提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积对立起来，这种看法和做法是不对的。进行农业生产，必须坚决执行农牧结合的方针。农牧业生产是互相支援互相促进的。按照自治州的情况，农业区有大养牲畜的良好条件，牧区也有大办农业的良好条件，农业区要大养牲畜，牧区要大办农业。只有如此，才能使自治州农牧业生产互相支援，共同跃进。各方面、各单位都要全力支援农牧业生产。要想尽一切办法，加强农牧业生产的劳动力，并开展节约劳动力的运动，充分发挥现有劳动力的作用。要全面贯彻执行农业八字宪法，尤其要兴办水利，改良土壤。这些工作做好了，就能促进农牧业生产继续跃进。
    其次，加强民族团结，充分发挥各族人民在社会主义建设中的积极性。自治州有十一个民族，只有建立起团结友爱、互助合作的新关系，才能充分发挥他们建设社会主义的积极性。因此，必须继续宣传党的民族政策，检查民族政策执行的情况；继续反对大民族主义和地方民族主义；重视在各族群众中发展党员和建立党的组织，使其成为领导群众斗争的核心。特别要重视培养以毛泽东思想武装起来的民族干部，这是加强民族团结，建立民族新关系，使各族群众向社会主义和共产主义前进的重要保证。
    第三，依靠群众，开展群众运动。我们的一切工作，都是群众的工作，都是为群众谋利益的，都得到群众的热烈拥护和积极参加。依靠群众的力量，任何工作都能做好，任何困难都能克服。
    第四，切实改进干部的领导作风和工作方法。要把群众的革命干劲充分地发挥出来，一定要改进干部的领导作风和工作方法。州、县、公社领导干部，长期在农牧区和群众一起同吃同住同劳动同商量，这对基层干部和群众鼓舞很大。广大基层干部也自觉地和群众一起同吃同住同劳动同商量，干部的强迫命令现象克服了，群众的生产积极性更加高涨。州、县、公社领导干部到生产大队安家落户，分片包干，长期工作，负责到底，对做好基层工作作用很大。全州普遍推行的“二五制”“三七制”“十四一制”的领导方法，已收到了良好的效果。这些好的领导作风和工作方法，还应继续予以发扬。
    为了保证做到以上各点，一个最根本的问题，就是要高举毛泽东思想的红旗，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，认真地贯彻执行党的各项政策。我们过去的经验证明：凡是用毛泽东思想武装了群众和正确地运用了总路线、大跃进和人民公社这三个法宝的，就能够充分地发挥干部、群众的积极性和主动性，克服困难，完成任务。
