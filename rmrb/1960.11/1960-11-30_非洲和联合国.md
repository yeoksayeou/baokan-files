Africa and the United Nations
By Ahmed Mohamed Kheir, Sudan

The national independence movements in African countries are flourishing. The people of Latin America, facing the severe threat of aggression from the American imperialists, are uniting to defend the Republic of Cuba and their own independence. In Asia, the people of various countries, regardless of the brutal suppression by the imperialist running dogs, are strengthening their struggles and unity.

The people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, through their resolute struggle against imperialism, have proven that only the people can decide their own destiny; only through the broad unity and unremitting struggle of the people of all countries can the irreconcilable contradictions between the people of all countries and imperialism be resolved.

In the current situation where the strength of the socialist camp exceeds that of the imperialist camp and the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism is unprecedentedly high, the imperialists, headed by the United States, are intensifying their aggression against Africa under the cover of the United Nations. Eisenhower's so-called "five-point plan" in his speech to the current UN General Assembly is nothing but an open call to make African countries helpless in the face of imperialist aggression, and to intensify the exploitation of Africa by the United States and other imperialist countries through long-term programs of the United Nations organization.

In fact, Eisenhower and his imperialist colleagues, under the guise of the United Nations, had already begun their aggressive activities against Africa long ago.

The Economic Commission for Africa, affiliated with the United Nations, was established only two years ago. At its first meeting in April this year, it began by accepting the recommendations made by representatives of the United States and other countries, advocating encouraging foreign capital and removing all obstacles to private investment in Africa. In September of this year, a delegation from this commission conducted activities in West Africa, including the Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, Dahomey, Niger, and Cameroon for several weeks. The delegation's mission was to find ways, under the guise of providing "economic assistance to establish development plans," to tie the newly independent countries in this region to the wheels of American and other countries' monopoly capital through the United Nations. Another United Nations economic agency, called the World Development Fund, was established in September this year with the approval of the World Bank, which is controlled by the United States. It is claimed that this organization has a wider range of economic activities than the World Bank in "assisting underdeveloped countries." The members of this organization include the United States, West Germany, Britain, and Italy, as well as some Asian countries that follow the United States and Britain, and some African countries.

The Economic Commission for Africa also convened a conference of economics teachers from universities across Africa in Khartoum, the capital of the Republic of Sudan, to study "the best methods and ways to utilize the United Nations organization and its affiliated agencies to economically develop Africa." What kind of "methods and ways" are these? We can draw conclusions from the activities of other organizations. For example, the World Bank, controlled by the United States, also uses the loans it provides to African countries as a means to force them to adopt policies that are beneficial to the United States. The president of the bank said at a press conference in Khartoum in May this year: "Whenever the bank feels that the government accepting the loan will lead the country to economic collapse as a result of implementing its policies, it will no longer continue to provide assistance."

UNESCO, in places where it provides so-called "assistance"—such as in some African countries—is reorganizing the local education system according to Western models. The United Nations' International Labor Organization is establishing so-called "training" centers for workers, with the aim of changing the nature of the trade union movement and turning the African trade union movement into a lifeless movement that only focuses on arbitration. Other United Nations agencies are also carrying out similar activities.

Under the cover of the United Nations, so-called experts and technicians are infiltrating African countries, occupying high-level positions, exerting harmful influence on these African countries, and collecting information and confidential intelligence about African countries' resources and other aspects, as well as information on the political activities of various social and political groups and parties, etc., in order to carry out sabotage activities by imperialist countries.

Through more than a century of practical experience, the people of African countries have deeply understood that huge foreign investments protected by force have been and are solely aimed at plundering African wealth, resulting in unimaginable suffering and the lowest living standards in the world. Today, no one who is clear-headed and honest would say that the nature of imperialism and monopoly capital has changed overnight, and that its purpose in establishing these institutions and utilizing the United Nations is truly to "assist" or "help" underdeveloped African countries.

The attitude of the people of African countries towards African economic issues and foreign aid has been clearly demonstrated at the various conferences and meetings of the Asian Solidarity Movement, as well as in other occasions. The All-African People's Conference, held in Tunis from January 25 to 30 this year, pointed out in its economic and social resolutions that "independence is a prerequisite for all economic development." The conference declared: "The people of African countries are determined to strive for the economic development and liberation of Africa for the benefit of the masses and under the supervision of the masses."

The ambitions that imperialists want to achieve in Africa through the United Nations can be summarized as follows:

First, to make the development of African countries dependent on Western monopoly capital led by the United States as much as possible, thereby blocking the path of these countries' independent economic development. There are two purposes in doing so: one is to use this dependence as a weapon of threat, so as to create economic difficulties for these countries whenever African countries adopt policies against imperialism and colonialism. The second purpose is to continue to make Africa a continent for the production of raw materials and a dumping market for Western goods.

Second, to weaken the Afro-Asian Solidarity Movement, whose goal is to unite all Afro-Asian forces to fight against imperialism and colonialism and to strive for the political and economic independence of the entire Africa and Asia.

Third, after subordinating the African economy to the European economy, to stifle African national culture in the way of "Western civilization."

However, facing the unity of the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, who are together with all democratic forces in the world and supported by the powerful socialist camp, facing the unremitting struggle of the people of all countries, all imperialist conspiracies are doomed to complete failure. The people of African countries, who have suffered under imperialist rule for hundreds of years, harbor immense hatred for imperialism, which has killed millions of Africans, enslaved the majority of them, and wantonly plundered and exploited their wealth and resources. The independence that the people of many African countries have won today is the result of a long struggle full of hardship and sacrifice. They have their own understanding and understanding of the independence they have achieved at such a great cost. They want their wealth to belong to themselves and not to foreigners under any disguise. They want to work, to be fed, to be clothed, and to have decent housing. They want their children to be educated, and they want to exercise their rights as free people in a free land. Honest ordinary Africans have no doubt that these noble and perfectly legitimate aspirations can never be realized by imperialists and their followers. This understanding, developed by the African people from long-term struggles, is the cornerstone of the continuing revolution in Africa against imperialism and neocolonialism led by the United States today.

Now, more and more people and governments in African countries have realized the new conspiracies of the imperialists through the United Nations. They vehemently condemned the United Nations for helping Belgian colonialists restore their hateful rule in the Congo, supporting imperialist agents in splitting the unity of the country, and attempting to place the Congo under US trusteeship. The governments of Guinea, Ghana, Mali, the United Arab Republic, and many people's organizations throughout Africa have exposed the vicious conspiracy of US imperialism to undermine the sovereignty, independence, and unity of the Congo under the banner of the United Nations. Similarly, on the issue of restoring China's rightful seat in the United Nations, the vast majority of African countries did not support the United States, but preferred to abstain from voting. However, the refusal to discuss China's seat in the United Nations has not diminished China's prestige in the hearts of the African people. The African people have supported and will continue to support the Chinese people and their just demands, namely: not only to occupy their legitimate position in the United Nations, but also to liberate Taiwan, Quemoy, and Matsu, parts of China's own territory. Today, the name of China is as loud as the African drums throughout Africa, filling the African people with warmth and courage.

The people of the Congo, in a very short period of time, exposed the true face of the United Nations; more and more people are quickly learning how to distinguish between true enemies and true friends. As long as US imperialism continues to manipulate the United Nations as its tool, the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, as well as the people of other countries, will continue to expose the ugly face of the United Nations against the people, and will do everything in their power to oppose its imperialist and colonialist conspiracies. The people are invincible. As long as they strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, they will surely win the victory in the struggle against all reactionary forces and aggressive forces.

    非洲和联合国
    苏丹  阿赫迈德·穆罕默德·凯尔
    非洲各国的民族独立运动正方兴未艾。拉丁美洲的各国人民正在美帝国主义者严重的侵略威胁面前，为了保卫古巴共和国，也为了他们自己的独立，而团结起来。在亚洲，各国人民不顾帝国主义走狗的一切残暴镇压，正在加强他们的斗争和团结。
    非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民，以自己同帝国主义的坚决斗争，证明了只有人民才能决定他们自己的命运；只有通过世界各国人民的广泛联合和坚持不懈的斗争，才能解决各国人民同帝国主义之间不可调和的矛盾。
    在目前社会主义阵营的力量超过帝国主义阵营力量和全世界人民反对帝国主义的斗争空前高涨的形势下，以美国为首的帝国主义者，正在联合国的掩护下，加紧它们对非洲的侵略。艾森豪威尔在他对本届联大发表的演说中建议的所谓“五点计划”，无非是一个公开的号召，要使非洲国家在帝国主义侵略的面前束手待缚，并且通过联合国组织的长期规划来加紧美国及其他帝国主义国家对于非洲的剥削。
    事实上，艾森豪威尔和他的帝国主义同事们在联合国外皮的掩护下，早就开始了他们对非洲的侵略活动。
    隶属于联合国组织的非洲经济委员会，成立不过两年。而在今年4月间的第一次会议上，它开头就接受了美国及其他国家的代表提出的建议，主张鼓励外国资本、消除在非洲进行私人投资的一切障碍。今年9月，这个委员会的一个代表团到西非的象牙海岸、上沃尔特、达荷美、尼日尔和喀麦隆进行了几个星期的活动，代表团的使命是在提供“经济援助以建立发展计划”等的幌子下，寻找办法，以通过联合国把这个地区新独立的国家系在美国及其他国家垄断资本的车轮上。另一个联合国的经济机构，叫做世界发展基金的组织，成立于今年9月，是在美国控制的世界银行的赞许下建立起来的。据称这个组织在“援助不发达国家”方面较世界银行有着更广泛的经济活动。这个组织的成员包括美国、西德、英国和意大利和一些追随美国和英国的亚洲国家，以及一些非洲国家。
    非洲经济委员会还在苏丹共和国的首都喀土穆召开了全非洲大学里的经济教师的会议，以研究“利用联合国组织及其所属机构在经济上发展非洲的最好的方法和方式”。这是什么样的“方法和方式”呢？我们从其他一些组织的活动中可以得出结论。例如美国控制下的世界银行，也利用它所提供非洲国家的贷款作为手段来强使它们采取有利于美国的政策。这个银行的行长今年5月在喀土穆举行的一次记者招待会上说：“每当银行感到接受贷款的政府由于推行它的政策的结果将把国家导致经济垮台的时候，它即不再继续给予援助。”
    联合国教科文组织，在接受它的所谓“援助”的地方——如在某些非洲国家，按照西方的方式重新规划当地的教育制度。而联合国的国际劳工机构正在建立所谓“培养”工人的中心，其目的是要改变工会运动的性质，使非洲工会运动变成只以仲裁为内容的一个死气沉沉的运动。其他联合国机构也都进行着类似的活动。
    在联合国的招牌掩护之下的所谓专家与技术人员，纷纷渗入非洲国家，占据高级职位，对这些非洲国家施加有害的影响，并搜集有关非洲国家的资源及其它方面的资料和机密情报，搜集各社会、政治团体与党派的政治活动情况，等等，以便帝国主义国家进行破坏活动。
    通过一个多世纪的实际经验，非洲各国人民已深深地懂得受到武力保护的巨大的外国投资，过去和现在都是以掠夺非洲财富为唯一目的，结果给非洲带来了难以想像的苦痛和世界上最低的生活水平。今天，任何头脑清醒和正直的人都不会说帝国主义和垄断资本的本性已在一夜之间发生变化，说它建立上述这些机构和利用联合国的目的，是真正为了“援助”或者“帮助”非洲不发达的国家。
    非洲各国人民对非洲经济问题和外援问题的态度，在亚洲团结运动的历次大会和会议上，以及其它一些场合早已清楚地表明了。今年1月25日至30日在突尼斯召开的全非人民大会曾在它的经济和社会决议中指出，“独立是一切经济发展的先决条件”。大会宣布：“非洲各国人民决心努力为了群众的利益并在群众的监督之下，争取非洲的经济发展和非洲的解放。”
    帝国主义者想通过联合国在非洲实现的野心可综述如下：
    一，尽可能地使非洲国家的发展依赖于以美国为首的西方垄断资本，借此堵死这些国家在经济上独立发展的道路。这样做有两个目的：其一是利用这种依赖关系作为进行威胁的武器，以便在每当非洲国家采取反对帝国主义和殖民主义的政策的时候，就造成这些国家的经济困难。第二个目的是使非洲继续成为原料生产的大陆和西方货物的倾销市场。
    二，削弱亚非团结运动，这个运动的目标是团结所有亚非力量为反对帝国主义和殖民主义，争取整个非洲和亚洲的政治和经济独立而斗争。
    三，在使非洲经济从属于欧洲经济之后，用“西方文明”的方式，来扼杀非洲的民族文化。
    但是，面对着和世界上一切民主力量在一起，并且得到强大的社会主义阵营支持的非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的人民的团结，面对着各国人民的坚持不懈的斗争，一切帝国主义的阴谋诡计是注定要完全失败的。几百年来在帝国主义统治下受苦受难的非洲各国人民，对屠杀了成百万非洲人，奴役他们中间的大多数，并且肆意掠夺和剥削他们的财富资源的帝国主义，怀有无比的仇恨。非洲许多国家的人民赢得今天的独立地位，是充满了艰苦和牺牲的长期斗争的结果。对于他们付出了如此重大的代价而取得的独立，他们是有他们自己的认识和理解的。他们要使他们的财富属于自己而不是在任何伪装下属于外国人。他们要工作，要吃饱，要衣穿，要有像样的住所。他们要使他们的孩子受教育，要作为自由的人民在自由的国土上行使他们的权利。诚实的普通非洲人毫无疑问地知道，他们的这些崇高和完全正当的愿望，是绝不能通过帝国主义者及其追随者来实现的。非洲人民从长期斗争中发展起来的这种认识，是今天非洲继续进行反对帝国主义和以美国为首的新殖民主义的革命的奠基石。
    现在，越来越多的非洲国家的人民和政府认识到了帝国主义者通过联合国进行的新的阴谋。他们激烈地谴责联合国帮助比利时殖民主义者在刚果恢复可恨的统治，支持帝国主义的代理人分裂这个国家的统一，并企图把刚果置于美国的托管之下。几内亚、加纳、马里、阿联等国政府和非洲各地的许多人民团体已经揭露了美帝国主义打着联合国的旗号，破坏刚果的主权、独立与统一的恶毒阴谋。同样，在恢复中国在联合国的应有地位问题上，绝大多数非洲国家都不支持美国，而宁愿在表决时弃权。然而，拒绝讨论中国在联合国的席位问题并没有在非洲人民的心目中降低中国的威望，非洲人民过去支持，并将继续支持中国人民和他们的正当要求，即：不仅占有自己在联合国的合法地位，并且解放台湾、金门和马祖等中国自己的一部分领土。今天，中国这个名字，在整个非洲如同非洲的鼓声一般响亮，使非洲人民听了就充满温暖和勇气。
    刚果人民在很短期间内，就揭穿了联合国的真实面目；越来越多的人迅速地学会了如何分清真正的敌人与真正的朋友。只要美帝国主义继续操纵联合国作为它的一个工具，非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲各国人民以及其他国家的人民就将继续揭穿联合国的反人民的丑恶面目，并将尽一切力量反对它的帝国主义和殖民主义的阴谋。人民是不可战胜的，只要他们加强团结和坚持斗争，他们定将取得反对一切反动力量和侵略势力的斗争的胜利。
