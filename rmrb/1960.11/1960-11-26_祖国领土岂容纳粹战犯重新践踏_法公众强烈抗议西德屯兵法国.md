Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 24th: The establishment of West German military bases in France has aroused increasingly strong protests from the French public. In Strasbourg, a mass rally was held on the evening of the 23rd to protest against the stationing of West German troops in France. Participants marched silently through the streets and laid wreaths at the monument to victims of German militarism.

The special congress of former Buchenwald concentration camp prisoners and their families, currently being held in Paris, issued an open letter to the French people, calling on them to actively fight against the establishment of West German military bases in France. It stated: "Our reason for unease and indignation is that the majority of the leaders of the (West German) new Bundeswehr were former officers of Hitler, some of whom have been convicted as war criminals. Those heinous officers still shamelessly wear the badges that Hitler awarded them for their crimes."

The weekly "New France" recently published an article condemning the stationing of West German troops in France. The weekly said, "Twenty-two years after the Munich Agreement, German troops are once again occupying our territory."

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, November 24th: French Defense Minister Messmer arrived in Bonn on the 24th for talks with West German Defense Minister Strauss.

A communiqué issued after the meeting stated that the two sides discussed "ways to further cooperate in armaments between the two countries." The communiqué also stated that during the talks, Strauss expressed his gratitude to the French government for "receiving" the West German troops sent to France for exercises.

It is reported that Messmer's visit to West Germany was to "exchange views" with the West German Defense Minister before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting next month.

    祖国领土岂容纳粹战犯重新践踏
    法公众强烈抗议西德屯兵法国
    据新华社巴黎24日电　西德在法国设立军事基地这件事激起法国公众日益强烈的抗议。在斯特拉斯堡，23日晚上举行了群众大会，抗议西德军队驻扎法国。与会者默默地走过大街，在受德国军国主义之害者纪念碑前献了花圈。
    正在巴黎举行的前布痕瓦尔德集中营的被囚者和他们的家属特别代表大会，发表了告法国人书，呼吁他们积极斗争，反对西德在法国设立军事基地。它说：“我们不安和愤慨的理由是，（西德的）新国防军的大多数头目过去都是希特勒的军官，其中有些人已被判决为战犯。那些罪恶多端的军官如今仍然厚颜无耻地佩戴着希特勒奖励他们犯罪的徽章。”
    “新法兰西”周刊最近发表文章，谴责西德驻兵法国。这家周刊说，“在慕尼黑事件二十二年以后的今天，德国军队又占领了我们的领土”。
    新华社波恩24日电　法国国防部长梅斯梅尔24日到波恩同西德国防部长施特劳斯进行了会谈。
    会谈结束后发表的公报说，双方讨论了“两国进一步在军备方面进行合作的办法”。公报还说，在会谈中，施特劳斯还对法国政府“接待”了派去法国举行演习的西德军队表示感谢。
    据报道，梅斯梅尔这次来西德的目的是为了在北大西洋集团理事会下月举行会议之前，同西德国防部长“交换意见”。
