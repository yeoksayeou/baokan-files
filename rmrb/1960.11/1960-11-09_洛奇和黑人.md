Lodge and the Black People

On October 12th, U.S. Republican vice-presidential candidate Lodge delivered a campaign speech at 116th Street East, Lexington Avenue, East Harlem, New York City. He swore, "If (the Republicans) are elected, we will act according to the following points: First, there should be a black person in the cabinet. Second, in foreign affairs, from the ambassadorial level upwards, a larger number of black people should be employed." Following this, he made a series of promises such as "ending racial discrimination" and "fair employment."

Lodge is by no means an advocate of racial equality. It suffices to mention the fact that he has never felt any unease about the discrimination and humiliation suffered by the representatives of African countries attending the UN General Assembly in New York. So why is he suddenly so concerned about the political rights of black Americans?

"New York Times" reporter Brooks' report explained what Lodge was selling in his gourd. It turns out that 116th Street East is an area "predominantly populated by Puerto Ricans," and "the vast majority of the audience speaks Spanish." When Lodge gave his campaign speech there, making grand promises on civil rights was clearly just to win over voters.

However, the outcome of the matter may have been unexpected for Lodge; his campaign tactic actually caused him a considerable setback. The next day, he went to North Carolina and Virginia to campaign as scheduled. According to Brooks, "The (North Carolina) state leaders welcoming Lodge were privately angry and uneasy about the Harlem statement (Lodge's campaign speech in the Harlem district on the 12th)." "A senior Virginia Republican told one of Mr. Lodge's advisers: 'The person who made the Harlem statement should be thrown from an airplane 25,000 feet high.'" Not only that, Nixon, the main figure in Lodge's Republican campaign team, also severely reprimanded Lodge for fear of offending racists.

Thus, when Lodge gave campaign speeches in Virginia and North Carolina the next day, he immediately changed his tune on the black issue, saying, "I cannot guarantee anything."

Issuing empty checks and then immediately announcing the next day that they cannot be cashed seems like an embarrassing thing. However, in the American election campaign, it has become a common practice for candidates to make a lot of beautiful promises and then completely deny them afterwards. Therefore, it is not surprising that Lodge is at ease with this practice of reneging on promises.

    洛奇和黑人
    10月12日，美国共和党副总统候选人洛奇在纽约市东哈姆莱区利辛顿道东一百一十六号街发表了一篇竞选演说。他赌咒发誓地说：“如果（共和党）当选的话，我们将依下列各点行事：一，内阁里应该有一个黑人。二，在外事方面，从大使级起，应该更大量地录用黑人。”接着，他还许下了“结束种族歧视”、“公平就业”等等一连串诺言。
    洛奇决不是一个主张种族平等的人。只要举出这件事实就行了：他对于出席联大的非洲国家代表在纽约所遭受到的歧视、凌辱，就从来不曾感到有什么不安。那末，为什么他突然会对美国黑人的政治权利这样关心呢？
    “纽约时报”记者布克斯关于洛奇的报道说明了洛奇在葫芦里卖的什么药。原来，东一百一十六号街是一个“波多黎各人占多数的地区”，听众中“绝大部分是讲西班牙话的”。洛奇在那里作竞选演说时在民权问题上大开支票，显然不过是为了拉拢选民而已。
    但是，可能事情的结果对洛奇来说也是出乎意外的，他所要的这个竞选手法居然使自己碰了不小的钉子。第二天，他按照预定日程到北卡洛林那州和弗吉尼亚州作竞选演说。据布克斯报道：“欢迎洛奇的（北卡洛林那）州领袖们私下里对哈姆莱声明（洛奇12日在哈姆莱区的竞选演说）感到生气和不安。”“一个高级的弗吉尼亚州共和党人对洛奇先生的一位顾问说：“提出哈姆莱声明的人应该从一架二万五千呎高的飞机上扔出去。”不但如此，洛奇所属的共和党竞选班子的主角尼克松也因为怕得罪了种族主义分子而对洛奇严加申斥。
    于是，当洛奇第二天在弗吉尼亚州和北卡洛林那州作竞选演说时，对黑人问题就马上改口说：“我不能保证什么。”
    开了空头支票了，而第二天就马上宣布不能兑现，似乎是件尴尬的事情。但是，在美国竞选运动中，候选人大说一通漂亮话而过后完全不认账，已经成了惯例。因此，洛奇对他这种推翻诺言的做法安之若素，也就不令人奇怪了。
