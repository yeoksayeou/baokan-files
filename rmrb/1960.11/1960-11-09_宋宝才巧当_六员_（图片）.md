Song Baocai Skillfully Serves as "Six Personnel"
Liu Zhen, Yu Hua (Illustrations)

    I. Song Baocai, the Party General Branch Secretary of Chenzhuang Management Area, Xin Dian Commune, Jiaohe, Tianjin, works in a thorough and down-to-earth manner, mingling with the masses. The masses praise him for skillfully serving as "six personnel": theory instructor, administrator, technician, repairman, sanitation worker, and propagandist.
    II. Comrade Song Baocai attaches great importance to theoretical study. No matter what the situation, he persists in studying theory. Once, when the general branch secretaries of various management areas participated in the collective study of the commune Party committee, he had an eye ailment, but he still took the material transport vehicle on time to participate.
    III. During the drought resistance campaign, some people lacked confidence in digging deep for underground water sources. He seized this contradiction and organized cadres to study "On Contradiction," establishing the idea of "sustained drought resistance, man will conquer nature" among the cadres. They actively searched for water sources and installed water dragons, saving 1,500 mu of dry land in the whole team.
    IV. Every time Song Baocai goes to a production team to guide work, he always goes to the canteen first, using the time before and after meals to hold informal heart-to-heart talks with the members, soliciting their opinions on the canteen. In order to improve the members' food, Song Baocai also conducted a pilot project in the Junzhang Canteen to set an example.
    V. He personally serves as the administrator, announcing the accounts to everyone every month. The members understand the canteen's financial situation and automatically save food.
    VI. In the drought resistance efforts, Song Baocai took the experienced mechanic Xu Yongchi as his teacher to learn how to repair irrigation and drainage machinery.
    VII. Song Baocai also uses his spare time to learn general medical techniques from doctors. One day, a member named Zhang Youlin suffered from gastroenteritis, and Song Baocai personally cured Zhang Youlin's illness.
    VIII. Song Baocai also often promotes the importance of hygiene to the members. He brings newspapers and political propaganda publications to the fields, reading the news and current affairs to the members during breaks.

    宋宝才巧当“六员”
    刘震　于化画
    一、天津交河西辛店公社陈庄管理区党总支书记宋宝才，工作深入踏实，和群众打成一片，群众赞扬他是巧当“六员”：理论教员、管理员、技术员、修配员、卫生员和宣传员。
    二、宋宝才同志十分重视理论学习，不论在什么情况下，他都坚持理论学习。有一次，各管理区总支书记参加公社党委集体学习，他正闹眼，但他仍按时乘拉料的大车赶来参加。
    三、在抗旱运动中，有些人对大挖地下水源信心不足，他抓住这个矛盾，组织干部学习了“矛盾论”，在干部中树立了“持久抗旱，人定胜天”的思想。他们积极寻找水源，安装了水龙，保住了全队一千五百亩旱田。
    四、宋宝才每到一个生产队指导工作，他总先到食堂里去看看，利用饭前饭后的时间同社员们开饭桌谈心会，征求社员们对食堂的意见。为了改善社员们的伙食，宋宝才还在军张食堂搞试点，做出样子。
    五、他亲自当管理员，每月向大家公布账目。社员摸清食堂的家底，都自动节约用粮。
    六、在抗旱中，宋宝才拜老机手许永池为师，学习修理排灌机器。
    七、宋宝才还利用空隙时间向医生学习一般治疗医术。一天，社员张有林闹肠胃炎，宋宝才就亲自把张有林的病治好了。
    八、宋宝才还经常向社员们宣传讲卫生的道理。他把报纸和政治宣传刊物带到田头，在休息时给社员们读报，讲时事。
