Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 18th. West German Chancellor Adenauer, in announcing his party's "program" for the coming years today, once again clamored to rely on the United States and utilize the North Atlantic Group to step up the arming of the West German "Bundeswehr" with nuclear weapons.

Adenauer delivered a speech at a joint meeting of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary faction and executive committee. In this speech, which kicked off West Germany's 1961 general election campaign, he strongly demanded that the West German army be given nuclear weapons. He reiterated that the West German army, as an "important component" of the North Atlantic Group, should be armed with "equal armament" as the forces of other member states. He expressed support for the U.S. plan to transform the North Atlantic Group into a "fourth nuclear strike force," because this plan contains a starting point for satisfying "German (West German) wishes." He also advocated for "reforming" the institutions of the North Atlantic Group to carry out nuclear armament.

Adenauer stated that he would make "strenuous efforts" to "cherish" West Germany's relations with the United States and the North Atlantic Group. He clamored that West Germany, as a "loyal partner" in the North Atlantic Group, will "fulfill its responsibilities to the end."

While clamoring for stepped-up nuclear armament, Adenauer also expressed his ambition to subvert the German Democratic Republic.

He said that recent speculation that he might be changing his strategy in dealing with Moscow are "fabrications and wishful thinking."

In discussing West Germany's relations with its Western European allies, Adenauer vigorously emphasized the recent "good relations" between West Germany and Britain. He announced that, according to the agreement between the two heads of government on "discussing the overall political situation from time to time," he will go to London in mid-December to meet with British Prime Minister Macmillan. Adenauer reiterated that West Germany advocates for "further integration" of the armies of the North Atlantic Group member states, and opposes France's claim to independently control its army. He expressed "regret" that he did not reach an agreement with French Prime Minister Debré on this issue during his visit to Bonn last month. However, he also said that the differences between West Germany and France on this issue have not affected their "friendship."

    阿登纳叫嚣加紧核武装
    鼓吹西德同侵略集团各成员国应有同等军备说推测他改变对苏联的战略是“想入非非”
    新华社波恩18日电　西德总理阿登纳今天在宣布他的党今后几年的“政纲”时，又一次叫嚷要依靠美国和利用北大西洋集团来用核武器加紧武装西德“国防军”。
    阿登纳在基督教民主联盟议会党团和执行委员会的联席会议上发表演说。他在揭开西德1961年大选竞选运动序幕的这篇演说中强烈要求给予西德军队以核武器，他重申作为北大西洋集团的“重要组成部分”的西德军队，应当同其他成员国的部队以“同等的军备”武装起来。他表示赞成美国的关于变北大西洋集团为“第四核打击力量”的计划，因为这个计划包含着满足“德国（西德）愿望”的出发点。他还主张“改革”北大西洋集团的机构，以便进行核武装。
    阿登纳表示要为“爱惜”西德同美国和北大西洋集团的关系而“紧张地进行一切努力”。他叫嚷说，西德作为北大西洋集团中的一个“忠实伙伴”，将把它的“责任完成到底”。
    在叫嚷要加紧进行核武装的同时，阿登纳还表示了妄图颠复德意志民主共和国的野心。
    他说，最近人们纷纷推测他可能在对付莫斯科方面改变战略，这些推测是“瞎编和想入非非”。
    在谈到西德同它的西欧盟国的关系时，阿登纳竭力强调最近西德和英国的“良好关系”。他宣布，根据两国政府首脑关于“不时讨论整个政治形势”的协议，他将在12月中旬去伦敦同英国首相麦克米伦会谈。阿登纳重申，西德主张北大西洋集团成员国的军队“进一步一体化”，而反对法国要自行控制军队的主张。他对上月法国总理德勃雷访问波恩时没有同他就这个问题达成协议表示“遗憾”。但是他又说，在这个问题上，西德和法国的分歧并没有影响彼此的“友谊”。
