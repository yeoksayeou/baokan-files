A Short Note on Nan San Island
Chen Canyun

Going to Nan San Island outside Guangzhou Bay, one feels open-minded and refreshed. This flat island without mountain peaks is like a green oasis on the sea, a stretch of emerald green. The sea breeze blows across the green fields, the sun shines on the green fields, and seagulls fly over the green fields, creating a beautiful and poetic painting. But looking at the island from afar, one worries: if a twelve-grade typhoon comes, would the astonishing waves completely submerge it? This worry is justified. The Nan San Islands have a countless tragic history of being bullied by typhoons and waves.

I remember that in the past, this series of islands were all sandbars, and almost not even a single wild tree grew. On sunny days, the sun baked on the sand, and the sand was as hot as if it had been burned. When it rained, the rainwater would quickly drain away, unable to be retained. Thus, even living people had difficulty finding water to drink, let alone crops or even weeds and trees. More seriously, the sand often buried land and villages. People fought with the sand for land, and there was a saying, "Three feet of sand without wind, sand like mountains when the wind rises." This is an exaggeration of reality.

Living in this extremely harsh environment, people starved every year and fled from famine every year. Men wanted to run away; women were reluctant to marry in. In the dark old society, peasants, whether adults or children, male or female, were all ragged and emaciated. Truly, if they closed their eyes, they wouldn't know if they were dead or alive. It is said that in the early Qing Dynasty, there were well-meaning officials who wanted to solve the problem by immigration, but it didn't work, so they gave up. How could the hungry and suffering people expect such virtuous policies from these lords? Besides, riding on their heads were also skinning and bone-scraping landlords, and raping and plundering pirates. People lived through those disastrous days like years.

But what about now? The Nan San Islands have become an oasis linking ten islands, a mythical and beautiful world. A fifty-li long and four or five-li wide windbreak forest stands curvedly on the coast, like a green Great Wall, protecting half of the island. The sand can no longer bury villages and fields, and it is retreating year by year, the area of the island gradually expanding. All the wasteland on the island has been planted with green trees, and crops are also growing well. Fishery and salt industry have also been greatly developed.

The entire island, the natural environment is becoming more and more lovely and beautiful, and at the same time, a prosperous scene has emerged. In terms of food, after liberation, the government always had to provide relief. When the People's Commune was first established in 1958, it was necessary to transfer in four million catties of rice and five million catties of sweet potatoes. This year, it can basically be self-sufficient. On the basis of the existing arable land area of more than 40,000 mu, it is also planned to expand the planting of rice and miscellaneous grains by tens of thousands of mu. This year, fish and salt can also be harvested, and more than 7,000 pigs and a large number of chickens have been raised. The air on the island is fresh and the shade is everywhere, which is more conducive to the development of livestock and poultry. Even the newly planted trees are a great wealth. In two or three years, a large number of seeds can be harvested and a large amount of timber can be cut. This beautiful island is truly full of treasures everywhere. Who would believe that this was the famine-famous barren island many years ago?

Along with the mythical changes in the natural environment, people have also undergone major changes. First of all, the population growth rate is very fast, with more births and fewer deaths. In addition, the return of those who fled from famine and those who drifted away has increased the population by nearly 10,000 in the past ten years, totaling more than 40,000. Secondly, people's physiques are no longer emaciated, but healthy and beautiful. They are full of love for the Party, and they can't finish talking about the benefits of the Party day and night. They praise the People's Commune to the skies. They are full of ideals and optimism about their new hometown and future prospects.

People's ideals and optimism seem to be concentrated in one person, and that person is Zhou Jianli, the first secretary of the commune's Party committee. He is a man in his thirties, tall and burly, with a forthright, cheerful, and optimistic attitude. He is a Lu Zhishen-type of good man with a strong heroic character. He has worked hard with the masses on Nan San Island for ten years. The harsh natural environment cannot scare him, and extraordinary difficulties cannot defeat him. He has always appeared at the forefront of labor with a heroic attitude and vigor.

People know that fighting against nature bare-handed is not an easy task, and it is not simple to fundamentally change the face of a small island with a very harsh and backward environment. For example, connecting the ten small islands into one, the sea blocking project is extremely difficult. Without a strong revolutionary will and perseverance, and without paying a huge labor cost, it is impossible to complete. For example, carrying out large-scale greening on sand dunes also requires a serious struggle. If planting trees doesn't survive in the first year, and doesn't survive after replanting, the masses become discouraged. In this case, should they stop or continue to move forward? Will continuing to move forward "waste money and resources and outweigh the benefits?" What if they don't move forward? These are all tests for the leaders. And the Party leaders there, together with Zhou Jianli, made up their minds to continue moving forward! They finally found a tree suitable for growing on sandy soil, "Mu Ma Huang," which survived. So, they immediately launched a large-scale mass tree-planting movement. After eight years of hard work, especially after the Great Leap Forward, everything was successful, and the face of the entire Nan San Island underwent a fundamental change.

From then on, the words "barren" and "poor" were permanently eliminated from Nan San Island, and the saying "Girls don't marry Nan San Island" also disappeared forever. The new terms that replaced them are "beautiful" and "prosperous." Isn't it? Just as Zhou Jianli and the people on the island wished, in three years, new brick-built villages will appear all over the island. They already have increasingly abundant material conditions. If they continue to struggle in the next three years, realizing a new type of socialist island is by no means a dream.

In this light, it is superfluous for anyone to worry again that Nan San Island will be submerged by astonishing waves. Today's Nan San Island has enough strength to resist any violent storms and waves, allowing people to live a happy life without disturbance. Moreover, it is like a young sentinel on the sea full of vitality, proudly overlooking the turbulent ocean. And it is like a pearl outside Guangzhou Bay, shining in the sunshine.

    南三岛小记
    陈残云
    到广州湾外的南三岛去，心胸开朗，精神舒畅。这个没有山头的平平坦坦的海岛，就像海上的绿洲，一片翠绿。海风吹在绿野上，太阳照在绿野上，海鸥飞在绿野上，构成一幅充满诗意的美丽的画景。但是从远处向岛上了望，却使人担心，如果来一场十二级的台风，惊人的海浪，是否会把它全部淹没？这种担心是有理由的，南三群岛有过数不清的被台风和海浪欺凌的悲惨历史。
    记得从前，这一列群岛全是沙洲，几乎连一株野树也不长。晴天，太阳晒在沙土上，沙土像火烧过一样，烫得厉害，下一场雨，雨水一下子就溜光了，留也留不住。这样，连活着的人们也不容易找到水喝，庄稼作物甚至连野草杂树，也就更不容易生长了。更严重的是，沙土经常埋没土地和村庄，人与沙土争地，人们有一句话，叫“无风三尺沙，风起沙如山”，这是一点也不夸张的现实写照。
    生活在这异常恶劣的环境里的人们年年挨饿，年年逃荒，男人都想往外面跑；女人不肯嫁进去。而在乌天黑地的旧社会里，农民们无论大人小孩，男或女，都是衣衫褴褛，皮黄骨瘦，真是闭上眼睛就不知是死是活。据说清朝初年，有过好心的官吏，曾经想用移民的办法来解决困难，但行不通，也就罢了，饥饿痛苦的人们，哪能盼得到这些大老爷的德政？此外，骑在他们头上的，还有剥皮削骨的地主，和奸淫虏掠的海盗。人们在那灾难的日子里，度日如年。
    但现在呢，南三群岛却变成一个十岛相联的绿洲，一个神话般的美好世界。五十里长四五里宽的防风林，弯弯曲曲地屹立在海岸上，像一条碧绿的长城，卫护着半边海岛，沙土不但不能再淹没村舍和田园，而且年年往后撤退，岛上的面积逐渐扩大。全岛的所有荒地，都种上了绿树，庄稼同时也长得很好，又大大发展了渔业和盐业。
    整个海岛，自然环境变得越来越可爱，越来越美丽，同时也出现了富裕的景象。粮食方面，解放以后还是一直要政府救济，1958年人民公社刚成立时，也要调入四百万斤大米，五百万斤番薯，今年却大致可以自给了。在现有耕地面积四万多亩的基础上，还准备扩种水稻和杂粮共几万亩。今年还可收获鱼和盐，还养了七千多头猪和大批鸡。岛上空气新清，绿荫处处，发展家畜家禽更为有利。就是新植的树木，也是一笔很大的财富，两三年以后，就可采摘大量的种子，砍伐大量的木材。这美丽的小岛，真是处处都是财宝，谁还相信这就是若干年以前，以饥荒著名的荒岛呵。
    随着自然环境的神话式的变化，人也起了重大的变化。首先是人口增长的速度很快，生育得多，死亡得少，加以过去的逃荒者、外流者的陆续归来，这十年中就增加近一万人，合起来超过了四万。其次，人们的体质已不再是皮黄骨瘦，而是又健又美了。他们对党充满了热爱，党的好处日日夜夜都讲不完。他们对人民公社赞不绝口。他们对自己的新的家乡，和未来的前途，充满了理想和乐观。
    人们的理想和乐观，好像集中在一个人身上了，这个人就是公社党委第一书记周健理。他是一位三十多岁的人，身材魁伟，态度豪爽，愉快，乐观，是有着坚强的英雄性格的鲁智深型的好汉。他在南三岛与群众一起，苦干了十年，恶劣的自然环境，吓不倒他，超乎寻常的困难，难不倒他，他一直以英雄的姿态，朝气勃勃地出现在劳动的最前线。
    人们知道，赤手空拳地和自然斗争，并不是一件轻松的事情，要把一个环境十分恶劣和落后的小岛，从根本上改变它的面貌，是很不简单的。比如把十个小岛联成一块，堵海工程就异常艰巨，没有坚强的革命意志和毅力，不付出巨大的劳动代价，就不可能完成。比如在沙丘上进行大规模的绿化，同样是要经过严重的斗争的，第一年种树种不活，再种也种不活，群众灰心了，在这种情况下，应该罢手还是继续前进？继续前进会不会“劳民伤财，得不偿失？”不前进又怎么办？这都是对领导者的考验。而那里的党的领导者和周健理一起下定决心，要继续前进！他们终于找到了一种适宜于沙土上生长的树木“木马黄”，种活了，于是立刻开展了大规模的群众性的种树运动。经过八年的艰苦劳动，特别是大跃进以后，全部成功了，整个南三岛的面貌，也就起了根本的变化。
    从此，荒凉，贫瘠的字眼，就在南三岛上永远消灭了，“有女不嫁南三岛”的话，也永远消失了，代替它们的新名词是“美丽”和“富裕”。可不是么？正如周健理和岛上的人们所抱的愿望那样，三年后，全岛都将出现砖砌的全新的新村。他们已具备了日益充裕的物质条件，在今后的三年中继续奋斗下去，实现一个新型的社会主义小岛，决不是梦想。
    这样看来，有人再担心南三岛会给惊人的海浪淹没，就是多余的了。今天的南三岛，有足够的力量，可以抵御任何狂风巨浪的袭击，使人过着不受惊扰的幸福生活。而且，它像一个充满生命力的海上的年青哨兵，傲视着波浪翻滚的海洋，而且它又像一颗广州湾外的珍珠，在阳光普照中发亮。
