Taking the Canteen as the Center, Grasping Collective Welfare and Individual Life, Promoting a Frugal and Simple Style:
Xinjiang Comprehensively Arranges Winter Life for All Ethnic Groups

Urumqi, November 16th (by our newspaper) – Party organizations at all levels in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, while focusing on production, are also grasping the comprehensive arrangement of winter life for all ethnic groups. They are not only arranging collective life for commune members with the canteen as the center but also paying attention to arranging individual winter clothing, housing, and firewood for commune members.

Most areas of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, located in the northwest of China, have long and harsh winters. Arranging a good winter life for all ethnic groups is not only related to improving the lives of the masses and enhancing people's physical fitness but also directly related to the sustained leap forward in various productions. Starting in October, party organizations at all levels have been specifically studying and arranging winter life for all ethnic groups. Each commune and production team has a commune party secretary, director, team leader, or party branch secretary specifically in charge of life arrangements. Six thousand cadres from communes, management areas, and production teams throughout the autonomous region, under the slogan of "Politics to the canteen, cadres down to the kitchen," not only insist on eating at the same table with commune members but also comprehensively help the canteen improve its management. Focusing on planned grain use, they have arranged the supply of grain and firewood for the winter, the storage of vegetables, and the repair of dining halls. Each county in the Tacheng area has transferred dozens of commune deputy secretaries or cadres above the deputy director level to go deep into canteens with relatively backward work and a weak foundation to serve as administrators, strengthening the leadership of the winter canteen work. Most canteens have formulated winter plans for grain use based on the busy and slack seasons of farm work, the abundance of melons and vegetables, and the cold and warm climate, implementing a system of rationing grain per person, eating with tickets, and returning savings to individuals. They also ensure a combination of coarse and fine grains, dry and thin foods, and the availability of melons and vegetables, ensuring that commune members eat their fill, eat well, eat hot food, and eat frugally. The pumpkins, fresh vegetables, pickles, and pickled vegetables stored in counties such as Yining can already ensure that each commune member can eat an average of about one catty per day before the spring vegetables grow next year. In the Hetian area at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, the seven rural people's communes in Luopu County, in addition to storing a large number of vegetables for the winter, also milled 150,000 catties of flour and prepared more than one million catties of firewood, laying a certain material foundation for doing a good job in winter life.

Party organizations at all levels in the autonomous region, while arranging winter life for commune members of all ethnic groups, also paid attention to solving the problems of individual winter clothing, housing, and heating for commune members. The commune party committees and production team party branches, in cooperation with commercial departments, promptly investigated the winter clothing, firewood, coal, and housing repairs needed by commune members of all ethnic groups through methods such as investigations, visits, and symposiums, so that the leaders had a clear understanding of the situation and then specifically helped commune members make arrangements one by one. The main points are: (1) In conjunction with the distribution of wages, do a good job in the supply of various winter supplies. The Altay area, where the weather is severely cold, supplied each Kazakh commune member who grazed livestock with a new pair of felt boots not long after the beginning of winter. (2) During breaks in production, holidays, or through other methods, spare commune members a certain amount of time to repair their homes, collect firewood, or harvest and process melons, vegetables, and other crops on their private plots to prepare for the winter. (3) Production teams and production brigades organized specialized teams and groups for house repairs, firewood collection, and sewing, while commune sewing factories and shoe groups organized mobile groups, taking sewing machines and toolboxes to the production brigades to help commune members solve winter problems.

In the specific arrangement of winter life for commune members, grassroots party organizations paid special attention to helping the elderly, orphans, and new commune members overcome some of the difficulties in winter life. The Luopu County Fenghuo Commune Party Committee specifically studied the winter issues of nursing homes and nurseries in September. Each production team promptly withdrew funds from the public welfare fund to purchase cotton clothes, cotton trousers, shirts, and boots to distribute to the elderly, orphans, and individual commune members with difficulties.

In arranging the winter life of the people, party organizations at all levels, through in-depth propaganda and education and careful organizational leadership, enabled commune members of all ethnic groups to further promote the fine tradition of frugality and simplicity of the working people. Communes universally organized tailors and shoemakers to set up stalls in the fields, on the land, or in canteens to carry out renovation and repair businesses. In the more than 310,000 winter clothes, quilts, boots, shoes, and other winter clothing items that Yutian County's people's communes have already solved for commune members, most of them were renovated or repaired, or solved by changing large sizes to small sizes, so as to both ensure needs and practice strict economy.

    以食堂为中心　抓好集体福利和个人生活　发扬节俭朴素作风
    新疆全面安排各族人民冬季生活
    本报乌鲁木齐16日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各级党组织在抓紧生产的同时，也抓紧全面安排各族人民过冬生活。既以食堂为中心安排社员集体生活，也注意安排社员个人冬衣、住宅、烧火等问题。
    地处我国西北部的新疆维吾尔自治区的大部分地区，冬季漫长酷寒，安排好各族人民过冬生活，不但关系着改善群众生活、增强人民体质，而且也直接关系着各项生产的持续跃进。从10月份开始，各级党组织就专门研究和着手安排各族人民过冬生活。各公社、生产队都有一名公社党委书记、社长或队长、党支部书记专门抓生活。全自治区六万名公社、管理区、生产队干部，在“政治到食堂，干部下伙房”的口号下，既坚持和社员同桌吃饭，又全面帮助食堂改进管理，以计划用粮为中心安排了冬季粮食、柴火的供应、蔬菜的储备和饭厅的修缮等。塔城专区每个县都抽调了几十名公社副书记或副社长以上干部深入到工作比较落后、基础较差的食堂去担任管理员，加强对冬季食堂工作的领导。大部分食堂都根据农活忙闲、瓜菜多寡、气候冷暖等情况，分别订出冬季计划用粮办法，贯彻实行粮食以人定量、凭票吃饭、节约归己的制度，并且做到粗细搭配、干稀搭配和有瓜有菜，保证社员吃饱、吃好、吃热、吃得节省。伊宁等县储存的南瓜、鲜菜、腌菜、泡菜等，已经能够保证在明年春菜长成以前每个社员平均每天可吃到一斤左右。昆仑山下和田专区的洛浦县七个农村人民公社除了储备了大批过冬蔬菜以外，每个公社还磨好了十五万斤面粉，打好了一百多万斤柴火，为搞好冬季生活打好了一定的物质基础。
    自治区各级党组织在安排各族社员过冬生活中，也注意了社员个人冬衣、住宅、取暖等问题的解决。各公社党委、生产队党支部协同商业部门及时通过调查、访问、召开座谈会等方法，对各族社员过冬需要的衣物、柴煤以及需要修缮的房舍进行了调查，做到领导心中有数，然后具体帮助社员逐一安排。主要有：（一）结合发放工资，做好各种过冬物资的供应，天气严寒的阿勒泰专区在刚入冬季不久就给全部放牧牲畜的哈萨克族社员，每人供应了一双新毡靴。（二）在生产间隙、假日或通过其它办法，给社员腾出一定的时间修缮住宅、打柴火或收获和处理自留地上的瓜、菜等作物，为过冬作准备。（三）生产队和生产小队分别组织房屋修理、打柴、缝纫等专业队、组，公社缝纫厂、靴鞋组等也组织流动组，带了缝纫机、工具箱深入生产小队，帮助社员解决过冬问题。
    在具体安排社员过冬生活中，各基层党组织还特别注意帮助老人、孤儿以及新社员等克服过冬生活中的一些困难。洛浦县烽火公社党委在9月份就专门研究了敬老院、托儿所的过冬问题。各生产队都由公益金中抽款及时购置一些棉衣、棉裤、衬衣、靴子发给老年人、孤儿和个别有困难的社员。
    各级党组织在安排人民过冬生活中，通过深入的宣传教育和细致的组织领导，使各族社员进一步发扬了劳动人民节俭、朴素的优良作风。各公社普遍组织了裁缝、靴匠在田间、地头或食堂设点搭棚，开展翻新补旧业务。于田县各人民公社已经为社员解决的三十一万多件棉衣、棉被、靴鞋等冬装中，大部分都是翻新补旧或以大改小解决的，做到既保证需要，又厉行节约。
