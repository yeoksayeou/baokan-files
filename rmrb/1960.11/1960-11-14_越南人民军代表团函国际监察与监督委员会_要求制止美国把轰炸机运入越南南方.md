Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 11th: The Vietnam News Agency reported today that the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam on November 7th, requesting it to take appropriate measures to oppose the action of the US Navy in transporting six fighter-bombers into South Vietnam on September 22nd.

The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army pointed out in the letter that on September 27th this year, the head of the delegation wrote to the Chairman of the International Commission, Gopala Menon, asking him to request the South Vietnamese authorities to transport the aforementioned US fighter-bombers out of South Vietnam, and to record this matter as a violation of the Geneva Accords. However, "two months have passed, and the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army has not received any notification from the International Commission regarding its views on this issue."

The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army urged the International Commission to pay attention to the following facts: In addition to transporting this batch of fighter-bombers to South Vietnam, the United States has also openly clamored to hand over a batch of the latest fighter jets to the South Vietnamese Air Force. For example, General Palmer, head of the "US Military Assistance Program," said in Saigon on September 27th that the United States would also transport jet aircraft into South Vietnam to strengthen the air force there. The Vietnam People's Army delegation believes that if the International Commission does not resolutely oppose the illegal transportation of six US fighter-bombers into South Vietnam, the United States will probably transport more military aircraft into South Vietnam soon. The letter pointed out:
  "If the United States is allowed to continue transporting war materials into South Vietnam and the International Commission does not take strong measures, this will further complicate the situation in South Vietnam and add difficulties to the implementation of the Geneva Accords."

The letter requested the International Commission to notify the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army of the results of its investigation into this matter as soon as possible.

    越南人民军代表团函国际监察与监督委员会
    要求制止美国把轰炸机运入越南南方
    新华社河内11日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团，11月7日写信给越南国际监察与监督委员会，要求它采取适当的措施，反对美国海军在9月22日把六架战斗轰炸机运入越南南方的行为。
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在信中指出，今年9月27日，代表团团长曾写信给国际委员会主席戈帕拉·梅农，请他要求越南南方当局把上述美国战斗轰炸机运出越南南方，并请他把这件事作为违反日内瓦协议的事件载入记录。然而，“已经过了两个月，越南人民军联络代表团一直没有得到国际委员会关于对这个问题的看法的通知。”
    越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在信中促请国际委员会注意以下事实：美国除了把这批战斗轰炸机运到越南南方外，还公然扬言要把一批最新式的战斗机交给越南南方的空军。例如，“美国军事援助计划”负责人帕麦尔将军9月27日在西贡就曾经说，美国还将把喷气式飞机运入越南南方，以加强那里的空军。越南人民军代表团认为，国际委员会如果不坚决反对美国非法把六架战斗轰炸机运入越南南方的行为，美国大概不久还会把更多的军用飞机运入越南南方。信中指出：
  “如果让美国继续把战争物资运入越南南方而国际委员会又不采取有力的措施，这将使越南南方的局势更加复杂化，并给日内瓦协议的执行增加困难。”
    信中要求国际委员会把它对这件事情的调查结果早日通知越南人民军联络代表团。
