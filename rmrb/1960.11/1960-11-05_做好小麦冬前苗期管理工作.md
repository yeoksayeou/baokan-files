Do a Good Job in Winter Wheat Seedling Management
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

The wheat sowing situation this year is excellent. Leaders at all levels are paying close attention, the masses are highly motivated, and widespread three-way combination discussions have been held to summarize local high-yield experiences and further implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. In addition, the main wheat-producing areas have generally experienced welcome rains during the sowing period (the eighth month of the lunar calendar). As the saying goes, "Rain in the eighth, tenth, and third months for wheat harvest" which is very beneficial for sowing and emergence. With such a good foundation for sowing, we must immediately focus on wheat seedling management to further guarantee a bumper harvest next summer.

From now until the winter management of wheat seedlings, the following four aspects should be addressed:

I. Immediately focus on ensuring full emergence. Wheat grains can emerge about a week after being sown. Due to missed sowing, clogged seed drills, clods, pests, and other reasons, there will be varying degrees of missing seedlings and broken rows after emergence. The missing seedlings and broken rows generally account for about 10%, but can reach more than 20% in areas with poor land preparation, which greatly affects the number of ears in the future. In addition, in order to fully utilize the land, personnel should be assigned to inspect and replant fields in parcels where the spacing between two drills or two sowing machines is too wide, and along field edges, corners, ditch banks, and埂 sides that could be planted but were not. For sporadic missing seedlings, denser wheat seedlings can be dug up nearby for even planting. The method of even planting is to dig a trench about two inches deep at the missing seedling location, loosen the soil of the transplanted seedlings, gently lift the seedlings, and plant them with their roots in the trench. When covering with soil, make sure that the heart is not pressed down and the base is not exposed (i.e., the stem that was originally in the soil is white). After planting, compact the soil with your feet. If there is insufficient moisture, water and fertilize appropriately to facilitate recovery and growth. The soil where the seedlings were originally dug up should also be leveled and compacted. If it is not possible to do a meticulous transplanting job at present, it can be done after the seedlings have tillered and grown strong. Broken rows longer than one chi can be replanted by opening a ditch. To ensure that the replanted seeds germinate as soon as possible, the seeds can be soaked for a day and night to allow them to expand and germinate before planting. If the soil moisture is insufficient during planting, the bottom of the ditch must be thoroughly watered after opening the ditch, and then the seeds are sown, and the surface can be covered with some wet manure to facilitate rapid growth. For row replanting, a single-foot drill, a three-foot drill, or ditch sowing can be used depending on the location. If using soaked seeds, the seeds can be mixed with fine soil and wood ash to facilitate sowing.

When underground pests occur in the wheat field, 666 bait or arsenic can be applied for control. To save grain, millet can be replaced as bait with crushed cake fertilizer or other substitutes mixed with the pesticide.

II. Build ridges and level furrows to improve field management. In the northern wheat-growing areas, water fields should have their ridges constructed after full emergence, and the ridges should be compacted to ensure that the ridges are straight as a line. Irrigation and drainage canal projects should be cleaned, repaired, and strengthened. In the southern wheat-growing areas, drainage ditches should be constructed. The ridges should be further leveled, and residual crop stubble should be removed. When the soil is moderately dry or wet, a stone roller can be used to roll the fields to crush soil clods. Saline-alkali land and very wet soil should not be rolled to avoid compacting the soil or causing salt to rise. All of these steps prepare for future management.

III. Cultivate strong seedlings. High-yield wheat must be cultivated into strong seedlings before winter. Strong seedlings have green leaves, an appropriate number of strong tillers, and well-developed roots. Weak seedlings are not strong, generally having yellow leaves, slender stems and leaves, insufficient tillering, and poorly developed or absent secondary roots.

With active management and application of seedling fertilizer, this type of weak seedling can completely eliminate the weak seedling phenomenon early on, turning from weak to strong before winter and laying the foundation for a bumper harvest.

Seedling fertilizer is also called tillering fertilizer or full-month fertilizer. It can be applied when the seedlings are not growing vigorously after the three-leaf stage. Generally, fast-acting nitrogen fertilizers are used, such as human manure, pig manure water, or ammonium sulfate. For application, human manure or pig manure water can be diluted two to five times with water and applied at a rate of ten to twenty dan per mu, which can quickly turn the wheat seedlings from yellow to green and significantly increase the tillering rate. Applying ten to twenty jin of ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrate per mu when the soil moisture is good has the same effect.

In areas with high salt content that is harmful to wheat seedling growth, iron harrows can be used to cultivate the land or hoeing can be performed, followed by covering with straw and manure to prevent salt from rising, and then human manure can be applied to promote seedling growth. In areas with high groundwater levels, ditches should be dug to drain water and lower the groundwater level.

Some wheat seedlings are prone to excessive growth due to early sowing, excessive sowing rates, and fertile soil. They have wide, dark green leaves, early lodging, and overcrowded plants. Spring wheat may even joint before winter. These wheat seedlings appear to be growing vigorously, but the stems are actually weak. These seedlings are considered excessively vigorous. The saying goes, "Wheat cannot be vigorous twice," which refers to not allowing excessively vigorous seedlings to form before winter, as excessively vigorous seedlings are a primary cause of winter freeze damage and early lodging in the coming year. When this situation occurs, control measures must be taken immediately, such as stopping the application of fertilizer and water and performing continuous rolling to inhibit growth. Overly dense seedlings can be thinned out with a harrow to achieve moderate density. If controlled well, a good harvest can still be obtained due to the original good soil fertility.

According to the experience summarized last year, high-yield wheat must eliminate weak seedlings before winter and be strong but not excessively vigorous. Generally, there should be two to five strong tillers before winter. For high-yield fields, the total number of tillers per mu should be 900,000 to 1,100,000 in the northern winter wheat area, 800,000 to 1,000,000 in the central winter wheat area, and 700,000 to 900,000 in the southern winter wheat area. Northern wheat seedlings should be prostrate on the ground, and southern wheat seedlings should not joint. If this standard can be maintained entering the cold winter season, and management measures are followed closely next spring, there is hope for a bumper harvest.

IV. Prepare for safe overwintering. After the wheat has reached the strong seedling standard through the above management, the weather gradually turns cold. The wheat undergoes pre-winter hardening, the sugar content accumulated in the stems and leaves increases, and it possesses a certain degree of cold resistance, entering the overwintering stage. To enable the wheat to better survive the winter, the following insulation and auxiliary measures can be applied to promote growth in the coming year.

1. Apply winter fertilizer. In the northern winter wheat area, there is a measure of applying winter manure. Winter manure is mainly farm manure, generally applied at a rate of about 3,000 to 6,000 jin per mu, spread over the wheat seedlings. According to a 1959 survey in Anguo, Hebei, the ground temperature can be increased by more than 2 degrees Celsius after applying winter manure. According to a survey in the Hongqi Commune of Pizhou County, Jiangsu, applying 6,000 jin of winter manure resulted in greening ten days earlier and an increase of 22% compared to not applying it. If the manure is hoed and harrowed immediately after application to integrate the manure and soil, the fertilizer effect will be even better. In addition, promoting the method of pouring urine in winter, collecting and pouring as needed, can reduce fertilizer loss and have a good effect. Pouring 1,000 jin of human urine per mu can increase wheat production by more than 50 jin.

Southern winter fertilizer mainly consists of river mud and pond mud, also mixed with pig manure and human manure, generally applied at a rate of about 100 dan per mu, with both cold protection and topdressing effects. Because southern wheat seedlings still grow slowly in winter, and spring varieties gradually enter the jointing and young ear differentiation stages during this period, the nutrient requirements are urgent. Therefore, applying winter fertilizer generally increases production by more than 20% compared to not applying it. Applying mud fertilizer can also suppress some ineffective tillers to promote the growth of effective tillers.

2. Irrigate with freezing water. Irrigating with freezing water is a cold protection and moisture conservation measure in the northern winter wheat area. Irrigating with freezing water can stabilize the ground temperature and increase soil moisture, thereby reducing cold damage and supplying the needs of seedlings for greening and growth during the dry early spring. Winter irrigation should be timely. Too early will not have a frost protection effect, and too late will cause the water to freeze on the ground, suffocating the wheat seedlings in the ice. Generally, winter irrigation should be carried out when the average daily temperature drops to 3-4 degrees Celsius. At this time, the water can quickly penetrate the soil after watering during the day and will freeze at night. In the Beijing area, this is around November 15th, in the Shijiazhuang area, around November 20th, and in southern Hebei Province, around November 25th. The land should be hoed once after irrigation to fill the cracks. In areas with sufficient rainfall and moist soil where the water content exceeds 18%, the effect of freezing water is not significant, and winter irrigation may not be necessary.

    做好小麦冬前苗期管理工作
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    今年小麦播种形势非常好。各地领导抓得紧，群众干劲足，普遍进行了三结合的讨论，总结了当地的丰产经验，进一步贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，再加上主要麦区在播种期间（阴历的八月）普降喜雨，农谚说“麦收八、十、三月雨”，对播种出苗就非常有利。有这样好的播种基础，就要立刻抓起麦苗管理工作，为明夏丰收取得进一步的保证。
    从现在起一直到麦苗入冬的管理工作，应当抓下列四方面：
    一、立刻抓全苗工作。麦粒入土一周左右就能出苗。由于漏播，下籽眼堵塞以及坷垃、虫害等原因，在出苗之后就会有不同程度的缺苗断垅。缺苗断垅一般能在10％左右，整地质量较差的可达20％以上，影响将来的成穗数很大。此外，为了充分发挥土地利用率，两耧或两播种机之间如果相隔太宽，以及田边、地角、渠旁、埂侧凡是可以种而没有种到的，都要立刻派定人员逐田包块进行检查补种。凡是零星缺苗的，可以就近挖取较为密集的麦苗进行匀种。匀种的方法可以将缺苗处挖深约二寸的沟，再将移植苗的土壤挖松，轻轻将苗提出，连根种在沟内，复土时做到上不压心，下不露白（就是原来在土中的茎呈白色）。种后用脚踩实一下，如果水分不足，可以适当浇水、施肥，以利恢复生长。原来起苗处的土壤也要平好踩实。如果目前无法做好细致的移苗工作，可俟幼苗分蘖、生长健壮以后再行移补。断垅在一尺以上的就可以开沟重新播种。为了使补种的能及早发芽，可将种子浸泡一昼夜，使种子膨胀萌动后再种。种时如果土壤水分不足，开沟后必须浇透沟底，然后将种子播入，上面可复盖些湿粪，以利迅速生长。成行补种的就可以看地点用独脚耧、三脚耧或开沟撒种。如果用浸过种的种子，可用细土及草木灰将种子拌一下，便于播种。
    当麦地发生地下害虫时，要撒施六六六毒饵或信石防治。为了节约粮食，可以不用谷子作饵，用饼肥或其他代用品磨碎拌药应用。
    二、筑畦平垅，做好园田化工作。在北方麦区，水浇地在全苗后要做好畦埂，将埂身拍实，做到埂直如线。灌排渠道工程应加以清理修整加固。在南方麦区，要做好排水沟。畦内要进一步平整，捡除残余庄稼茬子，在土壤干湿适度时，可用石磙压一遍，将土块压碎，盐碱地与土壤很湿时则不宜进行，以免将土压实，或引起盐分上升。这些都为以后管理做好准备。
    三、培育壮苗。丰产麦必须在冬前便培育成壮苗。壮苗是叶色葱绿，有适当数量的健壮分蘖，根部生长良好。苗不壮的是弱苗，一般苗色发黄，茎叶细小，分蘖不足，不长次生根或生长不好。
    这类弱苗如果积极管理，施用苗肥，完全可以早期消灭弱苗现象，使在冬前转弱为强，打下丰收基础。
    苗肥又叫分蘖肥或满月肥，幼苗在三叶期后生长不够健壮时即可施用。一般应用速效氮肥，如人粪尿、猪粪水或硫酸铵等。用法可以人粪尿或猪粪水冲水二到五倍，每亩施十到二十担，可使麦苗迅速由黄转绿，分蘖率显著上升。在墒好时每亩施用硫酸铵或硝酸铵十到二十斤，也有同样效果。
    在盐分较高有害麦苗生长的地可采用铁耙耧地或进行锄地，再铺盖以草厩粪，使盐分不能上升，再施用人粪尿催苗生长。地下水位较高的地就要挖渠排水，降低地下水位。
    有些麦苗由于播种过早或播种量过大，再加上地力肥沃，就容易形成徒长，叶片宽大浓绿，早期披伏，植株过于拥挤，春性强的麦子甚至在冬前拔节。这类麦苗，看起来生长茂盛，实际上茎秆柔弱。这种麦苗属于过旺苗。农谚说“麦无二旺”，就是指冬前不能形成过旺苗，过旺苗是造成冬季冻害和来年早期倒伏的基本原因。当发生这种情况后，要立刻应用控制措施，停止施用肥水，进行连续碾压，以抑制其生长。过密苗可用耙耙去部分麦苗，使稀密适度。如果控制得好，由于原来地力好，仍可获得丰产。
    根据去年经验总结，丰产小麦必须在冬前消灭弱苗，要壮而不过旺。越冬前一般应有粗壮分蘖二到五个。丰产田北方冬麦区每亩总分蘖数以九十万到一百一十万，中部冬麦区以八十万到一百万，南方冬麦区以七十万到九十万个较为合适。北方麦苗应匐伏地面，南方麦苗不能拔节，如能保持这个标准进入冬寒季节，明春管理措施再紧跟上去，就有希望获得丰产。
    四、做好安全越冬准备。当小麦经过上述管理达到壮苗标准后，天气渐寒，小麦经过冬前锻炼，茎叶积累的糖分增多，具备一定的抗寒能力，即进入越冬阶段。为了使小麦能更好地越过寒冬，可以应用下列保温辅助措施，并促进来年生长。
    1、追施腊肥。北方冬麦区有在冬季施用蒙头粪的措施。蒙头粪以厩肥为主，一般用量每亩约三千斤到六千斤，铺施麦苗之上。据1959年在河北安国调查，施用蒙头粪后地表可提高地温摄氏二度以上。又根据在江苏邳县红旗公社调查结果，施用蒙头粪六千斤的比不施的提早返青十天，增产22％。蒙头粪施用后如能随即锄耙，使粪土溶合，更能发挥肥效。此外冬季推行浇尿方法，随积随浇，可以减少肥分损失，效果很好，每亩浇人尿一千斤，可增产小麦五十斤以上。
    南方腊肥以河泥塘泥为主，也应用猪粪人粪尿掺和，一般每亩施用一百担上下，有防寒和追肥双重作用。由于南方麦苗冬季还缓慢生长，春性品种在此期间已逐渐进入拔节及幼穗分化阶段，养分需要殷切，所以施用腊肥的一般较不施用的增产20％以上。施用泥肥时并能压去一部分无效分蘖，以促进有效分蘖的生长。
    2、浇灌冻水。浇灌冻水是北方冬麦区的防寒保墒措施。灌冻水后可以稳定地温，增加土壤水分，因之可以减轻寒害，供应早春干旱时期幼苗返青生长时的需要。冬灌要适时，过早起不到防冻作用，过迟水在地面结冻，会使麦苗在冰凌中窒息而死。一般以日平均气温下降到摄氏3—4度时进行冬灌为宜。这时在日间浇水后，水分能迅速渗入土壤，到晚间即行结冻。北京地区约在11月15日左右，石家庄地区约在11月20日左右，河北省南部约在11月25日左右。灌后应锄地一次，以弥补裂缝。在雨水充足，土壤水分较湿，含水量超过18％时，冻水作用不大，可以不进行冬灌。
