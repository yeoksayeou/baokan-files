    Kunming Dispatch from this newspaper on the 19th: The Pingpo Management Area of Pingpo Commune in Dali City, Yunnan Province, is further strengthening its leadership over public canteens. By mobilizing the masses, calculating accounts team by team and canteen by canteen, they are clarifying their resources, practicing careful calculation, and establishing and improving the grain use system, strictly implementing planned grain use.

    After the harvest of the spring crops, the Pingpo Management Area mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of planned grain use in the past year. In the past year, thanks to the Management Area's early efforts in grasping planned grain use and economical grain use, the annual ration was sufficient for twelve and a half months, and more than 5,000 jin were saved. This year, all seven production teams in the entire Management Area not only retained their rations according to standards, but also had surplus reward grain. The masses unanimously believe that grain use must implement planned grain use, and we must calculate carefully and use it sparingly. Therefore, the Party branch adopted the measures of "two lineups" (lining up canteens, lining up grain resources), "three calculations" (calculating grain accounts, calculating vegetable accounts, calculating oil and meat accounts), and "three assistances" (assisting canteens in establishing systems, assisting in implementing grain policies, assisting in developing household production) to effectively strengthen the leadership of canteens.

    Zeng, the deputy secretary of the Management Area in charge of livelihood, successively convened three meetings of livelihood team leaders, stewards, vegetable professional team leaders, and cooks to clarify the situation. The result of lining up the nine canteens in the entire Management Area one by one was: the five canteens of the first, second, third, and seventh teams have experience in planned grain use. They have implemented the system of planned grain use since the spring distribution last year, and have grain savings and grow a lot of vegetables; the two canteens of the fourth and fifth teams are generally managed. Although there is a system for grain use and some savings, fewer vegetables are grown; the two canteens of the sixth team are poorly managed, leaders lack experience, grain use is unplanned, and not many vegetables are grown.

    In order to help each canteen make good living arrangements, the Party branch mobilized the canteen management personnel to calculate three accounts: first, calculate the grain consumption account, how much ration has been eaten according to the standard now, and how much is left; second, calculate the vegetable consumption account; third, calculate the oil and meat consumption account.

    Through lining up and calculating accounts, the Party branch first helped each canteen to arrange planned grain use and improve the grain use system. Based on the principles of eating more during busy farming seasons, eating less during slack farming seasons, and combining coarse and fine grains, the arrangement results in: each canteen can not only guarantee grain consumption, but also have ration savings. For example, the canteen of the fourth team with 204 people eating, according to their planned arrangement, can save 2,356 jin by the time of receiving new grain next year. The second is to help each team use the surplus reward grain well. After discussion by the masses, each team generally reserves half, and the remaining half is used as seeds to expand the planting area, increase feed, and subsidize grain during busy farming seasons.

    In order to ensure the implementation of the grain use plan, grain management and processing systems have been established from the Management Area to the production team. The regulations stipulate: first, special personnel and special warehouses should properly store grain. Second, strictly follow the grain requisition procedures, collect grain every ten days, and settle accounts once a month, ensuring that entry and exit are documented and usage is approved. Third, the Management Area processing plant uses machines for unified processing, which saves labor and improves rice and flour yield.

    With the help of the Party branch, each production team convened a meeting of commune members to implement the policy of "quantitative determination by person, quota to household, collective custody, eating by ticket, saving for oneself," and mobilized the masses to formulate grain use plans household by household. Li Fashun's family of five in the fifth team eats, and in the 40 days after making the plan, they not only ensured they were full, but also saved 9 jin and 3 liang.

    The Party branch also specifically helped each canteen arrange household production, allocated basic vegetable plots according to regulations, and seized the opportunity to organize commune members to rush to plant more than 20 mu of high-yield vegetables such as winter radishes, green vegetables, and cabbage, and planted more than 1,200 ponds of loofah. Each team also stored a large amount of pumpkin and dried vegetables.

    Due to the strengthening of the leadership of the canteen in the Pingpo Management Area, from the time of eating new grain on September 21 to the end of October, each canteen followed the planned grain use for every meal, and many commune members had savings. According to the opinions of the commune members, the fourth production team collects the meal tickets for the second meal after the first meal, and the cooks weigh the rice and cook it according to the needs, saving a total of 180 jin of grain in the past 40 days.

    平坡管理区深入发动群众细算账巧安排
    个个食堂严格实行计划用粮
    专人专仓管好粮食　严格建立领粮手续　户户制订用粮计划
    本报昆明19日电　云南大理市平坡公社平坡管理区进一步加强对公共食堂的领导，通过发动群众，逐个生产队逐个食堂排队算账，摸清家底，精打细算，建立和健全了用粮制度，严格实行计划用粮。
    平坡管理区在大春作物收打结束后，就发动群众总结了过去一年计划用粮的经验。过去的一年中，由于管理区及早抓了计划用粮和节约用粮，全年口粮够十二个半月吃，并节约了五千多斤，今年全管理区七个生产队不仅都按标准留了口粮，而且队队都有超产奖励粮。群众一致认为，用粮必须实行计划用粮，要精打细算，细水长流。于是，党支部采取了“二排队”（排食堂、排粮食底子），“三算账”（算粮食账，算吃菜账，算吃油吃肉账）、“三帮助”（帮助食堂建立制度，帮助贯彻粮食政策，帮助发展家底生产）的措施，切实加强对食堂的领导。
    管理区负责生活的副书记曾先后召开过三次生活队长、事务长、蔬菜专业组长会和炊事员会，摸清底子。全管理区九个食堂，逐个排队的结果是：第一、二、三、七队的五个食堂计划用粮有经验，从去年大春分配以来都执行计划用粮的制度，粮食有节余，菜也种得多；第四、五队的两个食堂办得一般，用粮虽有制度，并有部分节余，但是菜种得少；第六队两个食堂办得差，领导缺乏经验，用粮无计划，蔬菜种得也不多。
    为了帮助各个食堂作好生活安排，党支部发动食堂管理人员算了三笔账：一是算吃粮账，口粮按标准现在吃了多少，还剩多少；二是算吃菜账；三是算吃油吃肉账。
    通过排队算账，党支部首先帮助各食堂安排计划用粮，健全用粮制度。各食堂本着农忙多吃、农闲少吃和粗细搭配的原则，安排的结果是：各食堂不仅能做到吃粮有保证，而且口粮有节余。如第四队食堂二百零四人吃饭，他们按计划安排，到明年接新粮时能结余二千三百五十六斤。其次是帮助各队用好超产奖励粮。经过群众讨论，各队一般是储备一半，其余的一半用作扩大播种面积的籽种、增加饲料和农忙补助粮。
    为了保证用粮计划的执行，从管理区到生产队都建立了粮食管理和加工制度。规定：第一，专人专仓保管好粮食。第二，严格领粮手续，十天领一次，一月结一回账，做到出入有凭据，动用经审批。第三，由管理区加工厂用机器统一加工，既省劳动力，又提高出米率、出面率。
    各生产队在党支部帮助下，都召开了社员会，贯彻“以人定量、指标到户、集体保管、凭票吃饭、节约归己”的政策，发动群众逐户订出用粮计划。第五队社员李发顺家五口人吃饭，订计划以后的四十天中，不但保证了吃饱，而且节约了九斤三两。
    党支部还具体帮助各食堂安排家底生产，按规定拨了基本菜地，并抓紧时机组织社员抢种了冬萝卜、青菜、白菜等高产菜二十多亩，种下洋丝瓜一千二百多塘。各队还储存了大量南瓜、干菜。
    平坡管理区由于加强了对食堂的领导，从9月21日吃新粮到10月底，各食堂顿顿按计划用粮，不少社员还有节余。第四生产队按照社员的意见，头顿收好第二顿的饭票，炊事员按照需要量称米下锅，四十天来共节约了粮食一百八十斤。
