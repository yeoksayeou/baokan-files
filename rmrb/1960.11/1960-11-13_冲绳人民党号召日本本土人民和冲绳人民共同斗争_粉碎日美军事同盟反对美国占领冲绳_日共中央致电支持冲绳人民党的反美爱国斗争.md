Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 12th: On the eve of the Okinawa Legislative Assembly elections, the Okinawa People's Party issued an appeal, calling on the people of mainland Japan to launch a joint struggle with the people of Okinawa Island to smash the US-Japan military alliance treaty and strive for independence and peace.

    The Japanese "Akahata" published this appeal today.

    The appeal pointed out that due to the conclusion of the new "Security Treaty" by the reactionary governments of the United States and Japan, Okinawa's nuclear weapons bases have been strengthened. This not only forces the people of Okinawa to live a more painful life, but also poses a serious threat to peace in Asia.

    The appeal said that the Okinawa Legislative Assembly elections to be held on the 13th under this situation will be a very important election.

    The appeal said that the people of Okinawa have always believed that the struggle of the people of Okinawa against the United States turning Okinawa into a nuclear weapons base, against turning Okinawa into a US colony, and striving to return Okinawa to Japan is part of the struggle of the Japanese people for peace and independence, and called on workers and farmers and people of all walks of life in the motherland to launch a joint struggle with the people of Okinawa.

    The appeal stated that the people of Okinawa are combining the Okinawa election struggle with the mainland Japanese election struggle, and resolutely advancing the struggle to overthrow US imperialism and the reactionary forces of mainland Japan and Okinawa.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 12th: According to today's "Akahata" report, the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan have despicably distributed a large number of documents on Okinawa Island, spreading rumors and slandering the Okinawa People's Party, and plotting to sabotage the united front between the Okinawa People's Party and the Socialist Party, so that the Okinawa democratic forces candidates will lose in the Okinawa Legislative Assembly elections. The Okinawa Legislative Assembly election will be voted on November 13th.

    "Akahata" pointed out that these documents impersonated the name of the Japanese Communist Party and stated in the title "Copy of the 31st Directive from the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party to the Okinawa Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party." But in fact, there is no such organization as the "Okinawa Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party." The document spread rumors that "We are considering when to turn the Okinawa People's Party into a subordinate organization of the Japanese Communist Party."

    In order to alienate the cooperative relationship between the Okinawa People's Party and the Socialist Party, the document fabricated a JCP instruction to the Okinawa People's Party saying: "At present, we cannot fully trust the Okinawa Socialist Party and the Social Mass Party, but in order to use them as much as possible, we should establish a cooperative system with them on the surface." The document also spread rumors that "the JCP has sent funds to Okinawa through that secret route."

    "Akahata" pointed out that the wording used in the document does not sound like Japanese. Therefore, it can be concluded that it is either Japanese translated from a foreign language (English) or Japanese written by foreigners. The newspaper said that it is estimated that the central source of this conspiracy is the US intelligence agency stationed in Japan.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 10th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party sent a telegram to the Okinawa People's Party and all its candidates on the 9th, supporting them in their struggle to win the Okinawa Island Legislative Assembly elections to be held on the 13th.

    In the telegram, the JCP expressed its belief that the Okinawa People's Party, standing at the forefront of the Okinawa people's struggle and launching a struggle for Japan's independence and peace, against the United States' nuclear arming of Okinawa, and striving to return Okinawa to Japan, will achieve a great victory in this election.

    Currently, Okinawa Island's political parties have nominated eighty candidates to compete for the twenty-nine seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Okinawa People's Party and the "Okinawa Democracy Defense League" have nominated and recommended fifteen candidates to participate in the election, and have established close cooperative relations with the Socialist Party to carry out a joint struggle.

    In this election, the Okinawa People's Party announced fourteen anti-American and patriotic election platforms. The Okinawa People's Party advocates maintaining peace, striving for Japan's complete independence and neutrality, opposing the United States turning Okinawa into its colony, and opposing nuclear arming Okinawa. The Okinawa People's Party calls on all the people of Okinawa to do their utmost to strive to force the United States to return Okinawa to Japan.

    冲绳人民党号召日本本土人民和冲绳人民共同斗争
    粉碎日美军事同盟反对美国占领冲绳
    日共中央致电支持冲绳人民党的反美爱国斗争
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本冲绳人民党在冲绳立法院选举前夕发表呼吁书，号召日本本土人民同冲绳岛人民展开共同斗争，粉碎日美军事同盟条约，争取独立与和平。
    日本“赤旗报”今天刊登了这项呼吁书。
    呼吁书指出，由于美日反动政府缔结新“安全条约”，冲绳的核武器基地已被加强。这不仅迫使冲绳人民过着更加痛苦的生活，而且对亚洲和平造成了严重威胁。
    呼吁书说，在这种形势下将于13日举行的冲绳立法院议员选举，将是一次十分重要的选举。
    呼吁书说，冲绳人民一贯认为冲绳人民反对美国把冲绳变成核武器基地、反对把冲绳变成美国殖民地和争取让冲绳归还日本的斗争是日本人民争取和平与独立的斗争的一部分，并呼吁祖国的工人和农民以及广泛阶层的人民同冲绳人民展开共同斗争。
    呼吁书表示，冲绳人民正在把冲绳的竞选斗争和日本本土的竞选斗争结合起来，坚决推进为打倒美帝国主义、日本本土和冲绳反动势力的斗争。
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，美日反动派竟然卑鄙地在冲绳岛散发大批文件，造谣诬蔑冲绳人民党，阴谋破坏冲绳人民党同社会党的统一战线，使冲绳民主力量候选人在冲绳立法院选举中失利。冲绳立法院选举即将于11月13日进行投票。
    “赤旗报”指出，这些文件冒充日本共产党名义，在标题上注明
  “日共中委会书记局给日共冲绳县委员会的第三十一号指令抄本”。但事实上，根本就没有“日共冲绳县委员会”这样一个组织。文件造谣说：“我们正在考虑什么时候把冲绳人民党变成日本共产党的下属组织”。
    为了离间冲绳人民党和社会党的合作关系，文件捏造日共指示冲绳人民党说：“在目前不能全面相信冲绳社会党和社会大众党，但是为了尽可能地利用它们，应该在表面上同它们建立合作体制”。文件还造谣说，“日共已经通过那条秘密途径把资金送到冲绳”。
      “赤旗报”指出文件所用的词句不像日文。因此可以断定，它不是从外国文（英文）翻译的日文，就是外国人所写的日文。报纸说，估计这种阴谋的中心策源地是美国驻在日本的间谍机关。
    据新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会9日致电冲绳人民党和它的全体候选人，支持他们为争取在13日举行的冲绳岛立法院选举中取得胜利而奋斗。
    日共在电报中表示相信，站在冲绳人民斗争前列而展开为争取日本独立与和平、反对美国核武装冲绳、争取把冲绳归还日本而斗争的冲绳人民党，在这次选举中将取得巨大胜利。
    目前，冲绳岛各政党提出八十名候选人竞选立法院的二十九个议席。冲绳人民党和“冲绳民主主义拥护联盟”提名和推荐十五名候选人参加了竞选，并同社会党建立了紧密的合作关系，进行共同斗争。
    冲绳人民党在这次选举中公布了十四项反美爱国的选举纲领。冲绳人民党主张维护和平、争取日本的完全独立和中立，反对美国把冲绳变成它的殖民地，反对核武装冲绳。冲绳人民党呼吁冲绳全体人民全力为争取迫使美国把冲绳归还日本而斗争。
