    Korean, Albanian and Czech Peoples Warmly Celebrate the 43rd Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Korea
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 7th. More than 2,000 people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a grand meeting at the Grand Theater on the 6th to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.
    Among those attending the meeting were leaders of the Korean Party and government such as Hong Myung-hee, Park Kim-cheol, Jung Il-ryong, Nam Il, Kim Kwang-hyup, Rim Hae, Han Sang-du, Ha Ang-cheon, and Kim Ik-sun, as well as Foreign Minister Park Sung-cheol, Chairman of the Korea-Soviet Friendship Association Lee Ki-young, and others. Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Korea also attended the meeting.
    Jung Il-ryong, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and Vice Premier of the Cabinet, delivered a report at the meeting. Soviet Ambassador to Korea Puzanov also spoke at the meeting.
    In his report, Jung Il-ryong elaborated on the great significance of the great October Revolution, and pointed out that the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet people in communist construction infinitely inspire the people of all countries in the world who are fighting for peace, independence, democracy, and socialism. He also said that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, after achieving the great victory of the socialist revolution, hold high the banner of the General Line and continue the Great Leap Forward on all fronts of socialist construction, giving a huge impact to the liberation struggle of the oppressed people of the East.
    Jung Il-ryong said that imperialism has been isolated among the broad masses of the people, and its foundation of rule is collapsing day by day. No force can stop the process of the disintegration of imperialism that began with the October Revolution.
    When talking about preventing world war and defending peace, Jung Il-ryong said that as long as the forces that firmly demand peace unite, thoroughly isolate imperialism, and wage a resolute struggle against imperialism, it is possible to prevent world war and defend peace. However, the nature of imperialism will not change, and as long as imperialism still exists on the earth, the root cause of war will still exist, and the danger of war cannot be eliminated.
    Jung Il-ryong said that in order to defend peace, it is necessary to maintain the greatest vigilance, expose and smash the aggressive conspiracies of the imperialists headed by US imperialism, and unite all peace-loving forces to launch a resolute struggle against imperialism and the forces of war. If the imperialists dare to act rashly and launch a new world war, then the people will rise up and bury forever the imperialism that brought them terrible war disasters.
    He said that the firm and unwavering unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the struggle to maintain and consolidate peace. Imperialism and its running dogs are carrying out frenzied activities to weaken and destroy the unity of the world's peace fortress—the socialist camp, but this is in vain. No force can undermine the unity of the socialist camp, nor can it stop its growing power. Constantly crushing the enemy's sabotage activities and continuously strengthening the unity of the socialist camp is the sacred internationalist obligation of all socialist countries.
    Jung Il-ryong talked in detail about the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people in all aspects of socialist construction under the leadership of the Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung. He also talked about the heroic struggle of the people in southern Korea against US imperialism and its puppet Chang Myon clique, and the demand for the immediate withdrawal of US invading troops and the realization of peaceful reunification.
    In his report, Jung Il-ryong condemned modern revisionism. He said that it is necessary to oppose modern revisionism, which is a reflection of bourgeois ideology in the workers' movement and a manifestation of succumbing to the pressure of imperialism. He said that modern revisionism is the main danger in the international workers' movement, and it is important to continue to wage a resolute struggle against it.
    He said that imperialism and its servants, the modern revisionists, have launched a frenzied anti-communist movement to undermine the unity of the socialist camp, attempting to defeat the socialist countries one by one. He also said that the modern revisionists who faithfully serve imperialism cover up the aggressive nature of imperialism, beautify imperialism, deny the universal laws of socialist revolution, and carry out frenzied conspiracies to disarm the working class and its parties.
    Jung Il-ryong pointed out that we must be highly vigilant against the emergence of revisionist tendencies that spread illusions about imperialism and attempt to weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat and the leading role of the Party, and we should wage an uncompromising struggle against even the slightest manifestation of it.
    Albania
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 7th. The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the National Committee of the Democratic Front, and the Tirana Municipal Committee of the Albanian Labor Party held a grand gathering at the Tirana Opera and Ballet Theater on the evening of the 6th to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.
    Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, and Party and government leaders such as Politburo members of the Albanian Labor Party, Beqir Balluku, Gogo Nushi, Rita Marko, and Spiro Koleka attended the celebration meeting.
    Charge d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in Albania, Novikov, and other ambassadors of fraternal countries stationed in Albania were also invited to attend the celebration.
    P. Piristeri, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Albanian Labor Party, elaborated in his speech at the meeting the international significance of the great October Socialist Revolution and the changes in the world in favor of socialism over the past forty-three years. He particularly introduced the victory of the Soviet Union and Chinese revolutions and the great achievements made by the socialist camp countries in the economic, scientific, technological, and cultural fields.
    He said that forty-three years is a very short period in world history, but during these years, many amazing changes have taken place in the world. Socialism has become a world system and is advancing victoriously. The profound revolutionary changes of this period clearly prove the vitality of the Marxist-Leninist theory and the great October Socialist Revolution, and prove the superiority of the thriving socialist system over the dying capitalist system.
    Piristeri exposed the bellicose nature of imperialism and the conspiracies of arms expansion and war preparation, and exposed the fallacies of the modern revisionists, tools of imperialism, who deny the proletarian revolution, deny the dictatorship of the proletariat, say that Marxism-Leninism is outdated, and that the nature of imperialism has changed. He said that the purpose of the revisionists' propaganda in this regard is only to paralyze the revolutionary vigilance of the proletariat, castrate its revolutionary spirit, and let the bourgeoisie, armed to the teeth, disarm the proletariat at the decisive moment, and let the bourgeoisie do whatever it wants to turn the long-term struggle of the proletariat and the working masses into nothing when it decides to seize and defend power.
    Piristeri said that the foundation of the Albanian Labor Party's foreign policy, which is forever loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is our country's friendship and unbreakable unity with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Our party has systematically struggled for this since its establishment, and will continue to fight for further consolidating and strengthening the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the international communist and workers' movement, and regard this struggle as a matter closely related to the fate of socialism, opposing any conspiracy by modern revisionism to weaken this unity even a little bit.
    The meeting adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.
    Bulgaria
    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 7. The Sofia Municipal Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Sofia Municipal Committee of the Fatherland Front, the Sofia Municipal People's Congress, and the National Committee of the Bulgarian-Soviet Friendship Association jointly held a grand rally in Sofia on the evening of the 6th to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.
    Bulgarian Party and state leaders Boyan Balgaranov, Ivan Mikhailov, Raiko Damyanov, Encho Staikov, Georgi Traykov, and others attended the celebration. Some foreign envoys stationed in Bulgaria were also invited to attend the meeting.
    Todor Prahov, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "The Idea of ​​the Great October - The Victorious Banner of the Struggle of the Peoples of All Countries for Peace, Democracy, and Socialism."
    Todor Prahov said that after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the development of world history has been different from all past periods in human history. This is the irresistible history of the transition from capitalism to socialism, the history of the collapse of imperialism and the formation, consolidation, and victory of the world socialist system.
    He said that the many achievements of socialist society, born forty-three years ago, have actually proved the superiority of the socialist system over capitalism, strengthened the desire of the people of all countries to demand liberation, and consolidated their confidence in victory.
    He said that the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are a strong and united family of peoples of all countries inspired by common interests and common great goals.
    He pointed out that any conspiracy by US imperialism and any other imperialist elements to alienate the relations between socialist countries will be shattered.
    In his report, Todor Prahov expressed support for the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and he condemned the United States for still obstructing the six hundred and fifty million liberated and sovereign people of China from occupying their legitimate seat in the United Nations.
    A grand mass parade was held in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, on the morning of the 7th at "September 9th" Square to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. The leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party and government reviewed the parade on the rostrum.
    Czechoslovakia
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 7th. A grand rally attended by tens of thousands of working people of Prague was held here this afternoon to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.
    Attending the meeting were Czechoslovakian Party and state leaders such as Fierlinger, Siroky, and Simunek, as well as members of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Diplomatic envoys from various countries stationed in Prague also attended the meeting.
    Zdenek Fierlinger, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Chairman of the National Assembly, spoke at the meeting. Fierlinger pointed out the significance of the great October Socialist Revolution, and reviewed the long struggle of the Czechoslovak people inspired by the October Revolution and the fraternal friendship with the Soviet people. He said that we will do everything possible to consolidate the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp, and we are always ready to do everything in our power to defend this unity.
    Fierlinger said that in the past fifteen years, amazing changes have taken place in international life. The fundamental change is the birth of a powerful world socialist system. He pointed out that during the fifteen years, the entire colonial system is collapsing, because in addition to the majority of the past colonial countries having gained independence, other colonial countries are launching a resolute struggle for freedom and independence.
    Fierlinger said that, however, these major changes that determine the development of world history towards the happy future of all mankind should not make us ignore the fact that those dark forces that launched the Second World War are once again starting to mobilize throughout the world, and those forces that hate all progressive things do not hesitate to revive the militarist forces and chauvinist spirit of West Germany under the occupation of imperialist countries. The leader of these forces is the United States, which has become a country with the largest militarized economy. US imperialism uses its economic and financial power to try to make other countries fully accept its influence.
    Fierlinger said that the rapidly growing advantages of socialist countries and the peace-loving stance of many other countries are victoriously defeating the imperialist plots of threat.
    At the end of the meeting, the Friendship and Peace Relay, carrying the congratulatory letter from the Czechoslovak people to the Soviet people, began to advance towards the Soviet border.

    朝阿保捷人民热烈庆祝十月革命四十三周年
    朝鲜
    新华社平壤7日电　平壤市各界二千多人6日在大剧场举行大会，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年。
    参加大会的有洪命熹、朴金哲、郑一龙、南日、金光侠、林海、韩相斗、河仰天、金翊善等朝鲜党和政府的领导人，外务相朴成哲，朝苏友好协会委员长李箕永等人。各国驻朝鲜外交使节也参加了大会。
    朝鲜劳动党中央常务委员、内阁副首相郑一龙在会上作了报告。苏联驻朝鲜大使普扎诺夫也在会上讲了话。
    郑一龙在报告中阐述了伟大的十月革命的巨大意义，并指出苏联人民在共产主义建设方面取得灿烂成就，无限地鼓舞着为和平、独立、民主和社会主义而斗争的世界各国人民。他还说，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，在取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利以后，高举总路线的旗帜，在社会主义建设各个战线上继续大跃进，给东方被压迫人民的解放斗争以巨大的影响。
    郑一龙说，帝国主义在广大的人民中间已经孤立起来，它的统治基础正在日益崩溃。任何力量也阻挡不住从十月革命所开始的帝国主义的瓦解过程。
    郑一龙谈到防止世界战争，保卫和平时说，只要坚决要求和平的力量团结起来，彻底地孤立帝国主义，进行坚决的反对帝国主义的斗争，就有可能防止世界战争，保卫住和平。但是，帝国主义的本性是不会改变的，只要帝国主义还在地球上存在，战争的根源就依然存在，战争的危险也就不能消除。
    郑一龙说，为了保卫和平，必须保持最大的警惕性，揭露和粉碎以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者的侵略阴谋，团结一切爱好和平的力量来展开反对帝国主义和战争势力的坚决斗争。如果帝国主义者胆敢轻举妄动，发动新的世界战争，那么，人民就会起来永远地埋葬掉给他们带来可怕的战争灾难的帝国主义。
    他说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的坚定不移的一致和团结，是维护和巩固和平的斗争取得胜利的最可靠的保证。帝国主义及其走狗为了削弱和破坏世界和平的堡垒——社会主义阵营的一致和团结，进行着疯狂的活动，但这是徒劳的。任何力量都不能破坏社会主义阵营的一致和团结，也不能阻挡其威力的增长。不断粉碎敌人的破坏活动，不断地加强社会主义阵营的一致和团结，是所有社会主义国家的神圣的国际主义义务。
    郑一龙详细地谈到了朝鲜人民在劳动党和金日成同志领导下，在社会主义建设各方面所取得的光辉成就。他还谈到了朝鲜南部人民反对美帝国主义及其傀儡张勉集团的英勇斗争和要求立即撤退美国侵略军队，实现和平统一等问题。
    郑一龙在报告中谴责了现代修正主义。他说，必须反对在工人运动中的资产阶级思想的反映、屈服于帝国主义压力的表现——现代修正主义。他说，现代修正主义是国际工人运动的主要危险，继续同它进行坚决的斗争是重要的。
    他说，帝国主义及其奴仆——现代修正主义者为破坏社会主义阵营的团结而掀起了疯狂的反对共产主义的运动，企图各个击破社会主义国家。他还说，忠实地服务于帝国主义的现代修正主义者掩盖帝国主义的侵略本性，美化帝国主义，否认社会主义革命的普遍规律，为解除工人阶级及其政党的武装而进行着疯狂的阴谋活动。
    郑一龙指出，我们对为帝国主义散布幻想、企图削弱无产阶级专政和党的领导作用的修正主义倾向的出现，必须提高警惕，对它的那怕是微小的表现也应该进行不妥协的斗争。
    阿尔巴尼亚
    据新华社地拉那7日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、民主阵线全国委员会和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党地拉那市委员会6日晚在地拉那歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院隆重集会，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党政治局委员巴卢库、努什、马尔科、科列加等党政领导人都出席了庆祝大会。
    苏联驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆临时代办诺维科夫和其他各兄弟国家驻阿尔巴尼亚大使也应邀出席了庆祝会。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党政治局候补委员皮·皮里斯特里在大会上的讲话中阐述了伟大的十月社会主义革命的国际意义和四十三年来世界上所发生的有利于社会主义的变化。他特别介绍了苏联、中国革命的胜利以及社会主义阵营各国在经济、科学、技术和文化方面所取得的巨大成就。
    他说，四十三年在世界历史上是一个非常短暂的时期，但是，在这些年代中，世界上发生了许多惊人的变化。社会主义已经变成了世界体系，并且正在迈着胜利的步伐向前挺进。这一时期的深刻的革命变化，清楚地证明了马克思列宁主义理论和伟大十月社会主义革命思想的生命力，证明了蒸蒸日上的社会主义制度对穷途末日的资本主义制度的优越性。
    皮里斯特里揭露了帝国主义的好战本性和扩军备战的阴谋勾当，并且揭露了作为帝国主义工具的现代修正主义者否认无产阶级革命、否认无产阶级专政、说什么马列主义已经过时、帝国主义的本性已经改变等谬论。他说，修正主义者在这一方面的宣传目的，只不过是为了麻痹无产阶级的革命警惕性，阉割它的革命精神，在决定性的时刻里让无产阶级在武装到牙齿的资产阶级面前解除武装，在决定夺取和保卫政权的时候，让资产阶级能够为所欲为地把无产阶级和劳动群众的多年奋斗成果化为乌有。
    皮里斯特里说，永远忠实于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的对外政策的基础，是我国同苏联和其他社会主义国家的友谊和牢不可破的团结。我们党从建立之初就曾为此有步骤地进行过斗争，现在和今后仍将为进一步巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和国际共产主义和工人运动的团结而斗争，并把这一斗争看成是同社会主义的命运休戚相关的问题，反对现代修正主义企图那怕是一点点地削弱这一团结的任何阴谋。
    大会通过了致苏共中央和苏联部长会议的贺电。
    保加利亚
    据新华社索非亚7日电　保加利亚共产党索非亚市委员会、祖国阵线索非亚市委员会、索非亚市人民会议和保苏友好协会全国委员会6日晚在索非亚联合举行盛大集会，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年。
    保加利亚党和国家领导人博扬·布尔加拉诺夫、伊凡·米哈伊洛夫、拉伊科·达米扬诺夫、恩乔·斯塔伊科夫、格奥尔基·特莱科夫等出席了庆祝会。一些驻保加利亚的外国使节也应邀出席了大会。
    保加利亚共产党中央政治局候补委员托多尔·普拉霍夫在会上作了题为“伟大十月的思想——各国人民争取和平、民主和社会主义斗争的胜利旗帜”的报告。
    托多尔·普拉霍夫说，十月社会主义革命胜利后，世界历史发展已经不同于人类历史中的过去所有时期。这是不可抗拒的从资本主义向社会主义过渡的历史，帝国主义崩溃和世界社会主义体系形成、巩固和胜利的历史。
    他说，四十三年前诞生的社会主义社会的许多成就实际上证明了社会主义制度对资本主义的优越性，增强了各国人民要求解放的愿望，巩固了他们对胜利的信心。
    他说，以苏联为首的社会主义国家是为共同利益和共同伟大目标鼓舞的各国人民的坚强团结一致的大家庭。
    他指出，美帝国主义与任何别的帝国主义分子离间社会主义国家间关系的任何阴谋都将遭到粉碎。
    托多尔·普拉霍夫在报告中表示支持恢复中国在联合国的合法席位，他谴责美国现在仍然阻挠六亿五千万解放了的和主权的人民中国占居自己在联合国的合法席位。
    保加利亚首都索非亚7日上午在“九九”广场举行了盛大的群众游行，庆祝十月社会主义革命四十三周年。保加利亚共产党和政府领导人在主席台上检阅了游行队伍。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    据新华社布拉格7日电　今天下午在这里举行了有数万名布拉格劳动人民参加的盛大集会，庆祝十月社会主义革命四十三周年。
    出席大会的有费林格、西罗基、西穆?克等捷克斯洛伐克党和国家领导人，以及捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会委员们。各国驻布拉格的外交使节也出席了大会。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局委员、国民议会主席费林格在会上讲话。费林格指出了伟大的十月社会主义革命的意义，并追述了捷克斯洛伐克人民在十月革命鼓舞下所进行的长期斗争以及同苏联人民的兄弟友谊。他说，我们将尽一切努力来巩固社会主义阵营的磐石般的团结，我们随时准备尽一切力量来保卫这种团结。
    费林格说，在过去十五年中，国际生活中发生了惊人的变化。根本的变化是强大的世界社会主义体系的诞生。他指出，十五年过程中，整个殖民主义制度正在崩溃，因为除了大多数过去的殖民地国家已获得独立外，其它殖民地国家正在开展争取自由和独立的坚决斗争。
    费林格说，但是，决定世界历史向全人类幸福未来发展的这些重大变化不应使我们忽视这些事实：从前发动第二次世界大战的那些黑暗势力再次着手在全世界动员起来，那些仇恨一切进步事物的势力毫不犹豫地复活在帝国主义国家占领下的西德的军国主义势力和沙文主义精神。这些势力的魁首是美国，它已经成为拥有最庞大的军事化经济的国家。美帝国主义用它的经济和财政力量企图使其它国家完全接受它的影响。
    费林格说，社会主义国家迅速增长的优势和其他许多国家的爱好和平的立场正在胜利地击败帝国主义的威胁图谋。
    在大会结束时，携带捷克斯洛伐克人民致苏联人民的贺信的友谊与和平接力，开始向苏联边境进发。
