    Rectifying Labor Bases to Serve Teaching Work
    Harbin Institute of Technology Leverages School-Run Factories

    (Our dispatch) The leading cadres of Harbin Institute of Technology, in going deep into the front lines, helped various departments and school-run factories solve existing problems in production labor bases and scientific research, making the development direction of the school-run factories clearer. They also enabled some departments to begin to grasp the development patterns of their respective disciplines, starting with fundamental research.

    Since the beginning of July, the school's Party committee and responsible cadres of various departments have been spending two days each week delving into departments, specialties, and offices to investigate, research, handle problems, and promote work. They spend one day at school-run factories, basic construction sites, farms, and ranches to labor, work alongside workers, hold joint discussions, and conscientiously analyze and effectively solve existing problems. Li Chang, the school's Party Committee First Secretary and President, after participating in labor at the Metal Factory, held discussions with the staff and workers. Based on the new situation that lower-grade students can also engage in scientific research on a large scale and can achieve "one specialty with multiple skills" in labor skills in the department's factory, he helped this factory, which is responsible for training all first and second-year students in operational skills, to specifically link up with one department, combine with specialties, fix products, and serve the cultivation of high-quality talents and scientific research. After the merger of the Metal Factory and the Power Machinery Plant of the Department of Power Machinery into the "Red and Expert Power Machinery Plant," the staff and workers displayed unprecedented enthusiasm and creativity. In just twenty days, they cooperated with the school's Agricultural Modernization Research Institute to design and manufacture a new type of simple tractor with a simple structure and multiple uses.

    After school leaders delved into the Electrical Engineering General Factory, which is under the leadership of the Department of Electrical Engineering, they learned that although this factory could produce various types of motors and electrical appliances, the new products designed by the relevant specialties of the Department of Electrical Engineering had to be manufactured in factories outside the school. Although this factory could accommodate many people to work, students were temporarily assigned only after they arrived at the factory because the participation of students in factory labor had not been included in the production operation plan in the past. In response to these problems, a reasonable solution was carried out. Now, this Electrical Engineering General Factory has established corresponding "counterpart work sections" according to different specialties such as motors and electrical appliances in the Department of Electrical Engineering, to produce new products. It has also formulated a plan to accept 150 students to participate in production labor in the factory each month.

    Currently, the Party Committee of Harbin Institute of Technology is promoting the experience of units such as the Machine Tool Specialty in using dialectics to analyze the laws of science and technology themselves to various specialties, creating a new situation in scientific research work throughout the school.

    整顿劳动基地为教学工作服务
    哈尔滨工大发挥校办工厂作用
    本报讯　哈尔滨工业大学领导干部在深入第一线中，帮助各专业和校办工厂解决生产劳动基地和科学研究中存在的问题，使校办工厂更加明确了发展方向；使一些专业开始摸到了本门学科的发展规律，从根本上着手来进行科学研究。
    从7月初以来，这个学校的党委和各部门负责干部，每周用两天的时间分别深入到系、专业、科室等单位，调查研究，处理问题，推动工作；用一天时间到校办工厂、基本建设工地、农牧场等处劳动，和工人一起干活，共同座谈，认真分析并切实解决存在的问题。这个学校的党委第一书记、校长李昌在参加金工厂劳动后，和职工一起座谈讨论，根据低年级学生同样可以大搞科学研究，在劳动技能上能在本系工厂中达到“一专多能”的新情况，帮助这个担负训练全校一、二年级学生操作技能的金工厂，专门与一个系挂钩，结合专业，固定产品，为培养高质量的人才和科学研究服务。金工厂与动力机械系的动力机械厂合并为“红专动力机械厂”后，职工们发挥了空前的积极性和创造性，仅用了二十天的时间，就与学校的农业现代化研究所合作，设计、制造出了结构简单、一机多用的新型简易拖拉机。
    学校领导干部在深入属于电机系领导的电工总厂以后，了解到这个工厂虽然能生产多种类型的电机、电器，但是电机系有关专业设计出的新型产品，却要拿到校外的工厂去制造；这个厂本来可以容纳许多人劳动，但由于过去没有把学生到工厂劳动列入生产作业计划，学生到厂后才临时分配。针对这些问题，进行了合理的解决。现在，这个电工总厂已按照电机系电机、电器等不同专业，建立起了相应的“对口工段”，生产新产品；并且制定了每月接纳一百五十名学生到工厂参加生产劳动的计划。
    现在，哈尔滨工大党委，正在把机床专业等单位运用辩证法分析科学技术本身规律的经验推广到各个专业，使全校科学研究工作出现了新局面。（宋振绥）（附图片）
