Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 17th: The Korean Central News Agency today published a communique on agricultural production in 1960, stating: North Korea has achieved a historically rare bumper harvest this year. According to preliminary statistics from the Central Bureau of Statistics of the State Planning Commission of Korea, this year's grain output in Korea is expected to reach 3,803,000 tons, an increase of 40% compared to the highest annual output before liberation and more than double the grain output in 1946 after liberation. In other words, this year's grain production exceeded the planned output for 1961 as stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan.

The communique said: Great achievements have also been made in vegetables, animal husbandry, cash crops, fruits, and silkworm breeding.

The communique pointed out that this brilliant achievement made by all agricultural cooperative members this year under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and with the strong support of the heavy industry sector, once again proves the correctness of the agricultural policy of the Workers' Party of Korea, especially the great achievements brought about by the "Chongsan-ri" method formed under the direct leadership of Comrade Kim Il-sung.

The communique said that in order to implement the resolution of the enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in December 1959, Premier Kim Il-sung, while inspecting the work of Chongsan-ri in Kangso County, South Pyongan Province, and the Kangso County Party organization, made instructions to improve the management and leadership of the socialist economy and to improve the working methods and style of the Party, which illuminated the path forward for agricultural cooperative members and leading cadres in the agricultural sector nationwide. According to the instructions of Premier Kim Il-sung, cadres of Party and government organs went deep into the countryside, eating, living, and working with the cooperative members, publicizing the Party's policies, and patiently educating the masses with good deeds. As a result, a new relationship of revolutionary comradeship, mutual learning, concentration of strength and wisdom, and wholehearted implementation of the Party's policies has been further firmly established between leaders and the masses. In this way, the Party's intentions have penetrated into the masses, and the Party's policies have played a greater role in actual life.

The communique said that according to Comrade Kim Il-sung's instructions on conducting in-depth investigation and research and scientific calculation, distinguishing the priorities of work and concentrating forces on the central links, agricultural cooperatives in various places concentrated 87% of their labor force on agriculture centered on grain production. The leading role of the management committee of agricultural cooperatives has also been improved, planning work has been improved, intra-cooperative democracy has been highly promoted, labor days have been evaluated in a timely manner according to the quality and quantity of labor, and the principle of socialist distribution has been established.

The communique said: This year, the entire Party has supported agriculture. The strong socialist industrial sector supplied the agricultural sector with 2,000 tractors, more than 200 trucks, more than 5,600 trailers, and more than 120,000 units of agricultural machinery such as seeders, weeding machines, harvesters, threshers, electric motors, and crushers from January to September this year. In addition, a large amount of chemical fertilizer and pesticides were supplied. Thus, on the vast fields of North Korea, there are 10,050 standard tractors cultivating, an increase of 50% compared to the same period last year. The workload of agricultural machinery stations in the first ten months of this year increased by 70% compared to the entire year last year. As of September this year, the area of land cultivated by tractors and small and medium-sized machinery in North Korea has accounted for 94.7%.

The communique said: In addition, 3,186 technicians responded to the Party's call and went to the countryside. All this has further strengthened the worker-peasant alliance.

The communique said that the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee's policy of placing the establishment of a comprehensive irrigation system and mountain and river management work in the primary position of the agricultural technology revolution has enabled a bumper harvest this year even under unfavorable climatic conditions.

The communique said: This year, North Korea expanded its cultivated area by more than 103,000 chongbo (one chongbo is equal to 14.87 Chinese mu). The cultivated area of paddy fields and dry land increased by about 4% and 12% respectively compared with last year. In addition, the area of double cropping and intercropping was expanded, so that the grain sown area increased by 650,000 chongbo compared with last year. Agricultural cooperative members also accumulated a large amount of fertilizer and carried out soil improvement work; completed rice transplanting more than 20 days earlier than in previous years; and carried out weeding five to six times in all paddy and dry fields. In addition, advanced agricultural technologies were widely adopted. Thus, the yield per unit area of major crops has been significantly improved this year. Compared with last year, the average yield of rice per chongbo increased by 10.9%, corn increased by 17.2%, and soybeans increased by 15.2%.

The communique said: This year, the living standards of agricultural cooperative members have rapidly improved. It is estimated that the average agricultural cooperative household nationwide will receive 2.1 tons of grain and 300 won (Korean currency) in cash this year.

The communique said that agricultural cooperative members in various places are currently working hard to accumulate fertilizer, improve the soil, and prepare for a greater harvest next year.

    党的政策结出丰硕果实　工业支援发生巨大作用
    朝鲜农业生产获得历史上罕见大丰收
    今年粮食产量将比解放前最高年产量增加40％比1946年增加一倍以上
    新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜中央通讯社今天发表的关于1960年农业生产的公报中说：朝鲜北部今年获得历史上罕见的大丰收。根据朝鲜国家计划委员会中央统计局的初步统计材料，预计今年朝鲜的粮食产量将达到三百八十万三千吨，这比解放前的最高年产量增加40％，比解放后1946年的粮食产量增加一倍以上。也就是说，今年超额完成了第一个五年计划所规定的1961年的粮食计划产量。
    公报说：蔬菜、畜产、经济作物、水果和养蚕等也都取得了巨大成就。
    公报指出，在朝鲜劳动党中央的英明领导和重工业部门的强有力的支援下，全体农业社社员今年取得的这一灿烂成就，又一次证明了朝鲜劳动党农业政策的正确性，这特别是在金日成同志直接领导下形成的“青山里”方法所带来的伟大成就。
    公报说，金日成首相为了贯彻朝鲜劳动党中央委员会1959年12月扩大全会的决议，在视察平安南道江西郡青山里和江西郡党组织的工作时，为了改善社会主义经济的管理和领导，为了改善党的工作方法和作风而作的指示，照亮了全国农业社社员和农业部门领导干部的前进道路。根据金日成首相的指示，党和政府机关的干部深入农村，和社员们同吃同住同劳动，宣传党的政策，用好人好事耐心地教育群众。从而，领导和群众之间进一步牢固地结成了作为革命同志，互相学习、集中力量和智慧全心全意地贯彻党的政策的新的关系。这样，就使得党的意图一直渗透到群众中去，党的政策在实际生活中发挥出更大的力量。
    公报说，根据金日成同志关于深入调查研究和科学的计算、分清工作的轻重缓急把力量集中于中心环节的指示，各地农业社把劳动力的87％集中用于以粮食生产为中心的农业上。农业社的管理委员会的领导作用也提高了，改善了计划工作，高度发扬了社内的民主，及时地根据劳动的质和量评定劳动日，确立了社会主义分配原则。
    公报说：今年以全党的力量支援了农业。强有力的社会主义工业部门从今年1月到9月供应给农业部门以两千台拖拉机、二百多台载重汽车、五千六百多台拖车和十二万多台播种机、锄草机、收割机、脱谷机、电动机、粉碎机等农业机械。另外还供应了大量的化肥和农药。这样，在朝鲜北部广大的田野上，有一万零五百标准台的拖拉机在耕作，比去年同期增加了50％。农业机械作业所今年头十个月的工作量比去年全年还增加了70％。到今年9月为止，朝鲜北部用拖拉机和中小型机械耕作的田地面积已占94.7％。
    公报说：另外，有三千一百八十六名技术人员响应党的号召，到了农村。这些都进一步加强了工农联盟。
    公报说，朝鲜劳动党中央把建立全面的灌溉体系和治山治水工作置于农业技术革命的首要地位的政策，使今年在不利的气候的条件下，也获得了大丰收。
    公报说：今年朝鲜北部扩大了十万三千多町步（一町步等于十四点八七市亩）的耕地面积。水田和旱田的耕地面积分别比去年扩大约4％和12％。另外，扩大了双季和间作的面积，使谷物播种面积比去年增加了六十五万町步。农业社社员们还积了大量的肥料，进行了改良土壤的工作；及时地比往年提前二十多天完成了插秧；在所有的水旱田中进行了五次到六次的锄草。此外，还广泛地采用了先进的农业技术。这样，今年主要农作物的单位面积产量有了显著的提高。同去年相比，水稻每町步的平均产量增长了10.9％，玉米增长了17.2％，大豆增长了15.2％。
    公报说：今年农业社社员们的生活水平迅速提高，预计今年全国农业社平均每户能分到二点一吨粮食和三百元（朝币）现款。
    公报说，各地农业社社员目前正在努力积肥、改良土壤，为争取明年更大的丰收进行准备。
