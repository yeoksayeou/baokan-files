Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Electric Dispatch: The Hedong West Brigade of Pinggang Commune in Liangyang County, Guangdong Province, earnestly implements the policy of "public raising as the mainstay, with both public and private raising," vigorously helping small teams and canteens develop pig raising while consolidating and developing the brigade's pig raising industry. They are gradually achieving a situation where small teams and canteens mainly raise pigs, while also encouraging commune members to raise pigs, promoting the development of pig raising throughout the brigade. According to statistics as of October 20, the total number of pigs in stock in the brigade was 1,311, an increase of 1.9 times compared to the end of last year; of which 604 were in the brigade pig farm, accounting for 46% of the total; 573 were raised by canteens, accounting for 43.5%; and 134 were raised by commune members, accounting for 10.2%.

The Hedong West Brigade has always done a relatively good job in pig raising, and the pig raising industry has seen greater development this year. However, in the past, small teams, canteens, and commune members raised relatively few pigs. In order to develop the pig raising industry better and faster, in May of this year, the brigade party branch resolutely implemented the policy of "public raising as the mainstay, with both public and private raising," deciding to actively help small teams, canteens, and commune members develop pig raising while consolidating and improving the brigade's pig raising industry. It was stipulated that the brigade mainly raises sows, vigorously breeding piglets; canteens fatten pigs; and commune members fatten medium-sized pigs. Specific help was also given to canteens to overcome specific difficulties such as seedlings, feed, and pig pens. The seedlings needed for pig raising by canteens and commune members are currently supplied uniformly by the brigade; each canteen also raises two or three sows so that they can gradually achieve self-breeding and self-raising in the future. In terms of feed, it is stipulated that the rice bran and rice crumbs processed from grain eaten by the canteen are entirely controlled and used by the canteen; the brigade allocates a portion of land to the canteen to grow feed; the canteen's daily rice washing water and vegetable scraps are entirely used by the canteen for pig raising. The feed for commune members' families raising pigs is solved by commune members' production on their private plots; commune members can also bring home potato peels and potato ends left over from eating in the canteen to feed pigs; in addition, the canteen also supplies a small amount of rice bran to commune members to raise piglets. For pig pens, in addition to mobilizing commune members to build them using old houses and old materials, the brigade also provided 3,200 jin of lime and more than 7,000 substandard bricks to help canteens build pig pens. Now, each canteen has built a small pig farm, ensuring that every pig has a pig pen.

In order to help canteens raise pigs well, the brigade party branch designated the brigade's animal husbandry team leader and the team leader in charge of daily life to take charge of animal husbandry production; each small team designated a deputy team leader to be in charge of canteen pig raising; and each canteen also has a fixed person to take charge of pig raising work. The brigade also established a veterinary station, visiting each canteen pig farm every three days to check the health of the pigs, giving priority to prevention and providing timely treatment for diseases. The entire brigade conducts evaluations and inspections of canteen pig raising work twice a month in order to promptly identify and solve problems.

After taking these measures and strengthening leadership, the enthusiasm of canteens and commune members for raising pigs has greatly increased. For example, the Xinjiu District small team canteen used to raise only 60 pigs, but after the brigade's help, it quickly increased to 80 pigs, achieving the requirement of one pig per household. With more pigs raised by the canteens, in addition to commune members eating meat, they can also sell pigs to the state. In this way, the canteen not only has funds, but also has a batch of high-quality fertilizer to develop household production, making the canteen more and more consolidated, and the commune members' enthusiasm for production is getting higher and higher.

    河东西大队养猪公私两旺
    公养户养存栏猪十个月增长近二倍，个个食堂都有养猪场
    新华社广州电　广东两阳县平岗公社河东西大队认真贯彻公养为主、公养私养并举的方针，在巩固和发展大队养猪业的同时，大力帮助小队和食堂发展养猪；逐步做到小队和食堂养猪为主，同时鼓励社员养猪，推动了全队养猪业的发展。到10月20日止的统计，全队存栏猪共有一千三百一十一头，比去年年底增长一点九倍；其中大队猪场六百零四头，占总存栏数46％；食堂养猪五百七十三头，占总存栏数43.5％；社员养猪一百三十四头，占总存栏数10.2％。
    河东西大队的养猪工作一直抓得比较好，今年以来养猪业又有较大的发展。但是过去小队食堂和社员养得还是比较少。为了更好更快地发展养猪业，今年5月间，大队党支部坚决贯彻了公养为主、公养私养并举的方针，决定在巩固提高大队养猪业的同时，积极帮助小队食堂和社员发展养猪。规定大队主要饲养母猪，大力繁殖小猪；食堂育肥猪；社员育中猪。并且具体帮助食堂克服种苗、饲料和猪舍等具体困难。食堂和社员养猪所需的种苗，目前统一由大队供给；每个食堂也养两三头母猪，以便今后逐步做到自繁自养。饲料方面，规定食堂用自食粮食加工的米糠、米碎，全归食堂掌握自用；大队划出一部分土地给食堂种饲料；食堂每天的洗米水和菜头菜尾，全归食堂自用养猪。社员家庭养猪的饲料，由社员在自留地生产解决；社员在食堂吃剩的薯皮、薯尾也可带回家喂猪；另外，食堂还供应少量米糠给社员养小猪。对于猪舍，除发动社员利用旧屋和旧料修建外，大队还拿出三千二百斤石灰、七千多块次砖，帮助食堂建猪舍。现在，每个食堂都建有一个小型猪场，做到头头猪有猪舍。
    为了帮助食堂养好猪，大队党支部指定大队畜牧队长和抓生活的队长抓好畜牧业生产；各小队指定一个副队长专管食堂养猪；每个食堂也都有固定的人抓养猪工作。大队还建立了一个兽医站，每三天到各食堂猪场检查一次猪的健康情况，做到预防为主，有病及时治疗。全大队每月进行两次食堂养猪工作的评比检查，以便及时发现问题及时解决。
    采取这些措施和加强领导以后，食堂和社员养猪的积极性大大提高。例如新旧区小队食堂过去只养猪六十头，经过大队的帮助以后，迅速增养到八十头，实现了一户一头猪的要求。食堂养猪多了，除社员吃肉外，还可出售猪给国家。这样，食堂不但有资金，而且还有一批优质肥料，发展家底生产，使食堂越办越巩固，社员的生产干劲越来越高。（附图片）
