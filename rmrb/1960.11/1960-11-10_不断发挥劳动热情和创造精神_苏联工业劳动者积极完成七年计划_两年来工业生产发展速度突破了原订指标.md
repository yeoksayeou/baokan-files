(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow) Soviet industrial workers are triumphantly and gloriously implementing the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) for building communism. The situation in the past two years shows that the development of Soviet industrial production has accelerated beyond the original pace. In the past year and the first three quarters of this year, the total industrial output value of the country increased by more than 11% and 10% respectively, breaking through the original targets for these two years (7.7% and 8.1%).

At the same time, in these two years, the growth rate of many important industrial sectors and most important industrial products in the Soviet Union has been higher than the original annual targets and higher than the average annual growth rate originally set in the Seven-Year Plan. For example, in the past year and the first three quarters of this year, the production speed of the machine manufacturing industry accelerated by 50% compared with the original plan; the growth rate of pig iron and steel accelerated by approximately 50% compared with the average annual speed between 1955 and 1958. The growth rates of other products such as iron ore, chemical fertilizers, man-made fibers, and synthetic fibers also doubled in the first nine months of this year compared to the same period last year. Thus, from the beginning of last year to the end of June this year, Soviet workers overfulfilled the plan by producing 3.4 million tons of steel, 2.6 million tons of steel products, more than 4 million tons of iron ore, 5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, more than 600 million meters of textiles, and many other products for the country.

In terms of capital construction, from the beginning of 1959 to September this year, the Soviet Union has built more than 1,500 industrial enterprises equipped with new equipment; an average of five industrial enterprises have been completed and put into production every twenty days. Among them, many enterprises were completed and put into production several months or even more than a year ahead of schedule.

All these achievements on the Soviet industrial front are the result of the continuous labor enthusiasm and creative spirit of the vast number of employees.

Since the beginning of last year, industrial workers across the Soviet Union have enthusiastically launched socialist competitions to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The competition movement has deepened, and the forms and content of the competition have become increasingly rich. In the movement, many new people and new things full of communist spirit have emerged continuously. Two years ago, the "Communist Labor Brigade" movement initiated at the Moscow-Ryazan Railway transfer station has now spread throughout the country, and "Work, work, and study in a communist way!" has become the common action slogan of more than 7 million employees. Following this movement, the Soviet Union has introduced the "Advanced Help Backward" movement initiated by the famous textile worker Gaganova. To date, more than 40,000 people across the country have responded to Gaganova's initiative. They do not care about personal gains or losses, and voluntarily help other work teams, labor collectives, or individuals reach advanced levels. Since the beginning of this year, a wave of competition between economic regions and republics has been set off across the Soviet Union. Many companies have established close relationships of mutual support and common improvement. Because the vast number of employees continuously explored production potential, cooperated with each other, and helped each other in these movements and competitions, many factories and enterprises have continuously completed production tasks ahead of schedule in the past two years, and have repeatedly proposed higher production targets. For example, in the Tatar oil fields, all work teams of the Aznakayev Drilling Bureau overfulfilled the production plan for the first two years of the Seven-Year Plan before August this year. They further proposed to strive to complete the entire Seven-Year Plan in three years, instead of the original five years.

For nearly two years, the vast number of Soviet employees have more actively participated in improving production and improving technology. To date, more than 2.8 million employees across the Soviet Union have joined the ranks of inventors and rationalization proposers. From the time the Seven-Year Plan began to be implemented to the end of September this year, they have put forward a total of more than 6 million suggestions for improving production. These suggestions have promoted the progress of industrial production technology and the improvement of comprehensive mechanization and automation. In the past two years, thousands of automated, semi-automated production lines and assembly lines have been put into production in industrial enterprises across the Soviet Union. This year, the production of highly precision machine tools, automated and semi-automated production lines, control instruments and calculating machines in various places has increased by more than one-third compared with last year.

Under the conditions of continuously accelerating the speed of development and overfulfilling the plan, many workers, workshops, and factories, as well as many regions, have now reached the production levels or other indicators originally scheduled for several years later in the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. For example, by the beginning of October this year, 65 factories in the Sverdlovsk economic region had reached the 1962 production level ahead of schedule, 7 factories had reached the 1964 level, and 23 factories had reached the 1965 level. On the eve of the October Revolution, the Kirov Economic Zone also sent the good news that the industrial labor productivity of the entire region had reached the 1962 level ahead of schedule.

According to Soviet press reports, based on the situation in the past two years, the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union by the end of this year will increase by nearly 23% compared with 1958, instead of the 17% originally planned in the Seven-Year Plan. In this way, the production task of increasing 80% of production stipulated by the Seven-Year Plan for industry will likely be achieved within six years. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the total industrial output value of the country can be increased by about one time.

    不断发挥劳动热情和创造精神
    苏联工业劳动者积极完成七年计划
    两年来工业生产发展速度突破了原订指标
    据新华社莫斯科讯　苏联工业劳动者高奏凯歌，光荣地执行着建设共产主义的七年计划（1959——1965年）。近两年来的情况表明，苏联工业生产的发展比原定的速度加快了。在去年一年和今年头三季内，全国工业总产值就分别提高了11％以上和10％，突破了这两年原定的指标（7.7％和8.1％）。
    和这同时，在这两年内，苏联许多重要工业部门和大多数重要工业产品生产的增长速度，既高于各年原定年度指标，也高于七年计划原定的每年平均增长速度。例如，在去年和今年头三季，机器制造工业的生产速度比原计划加快了50％；生铁和钢的增长速度比1955至1958年几年间的每年平均速度加快了大约50％。其他如铁矿砂、化学肥料、人造纤维和合成纤维的增长速度，在今年头九个月内也比去年同期加快了一倍。这样，从去年年初到今年6月底，苏联工人就超计划为国家多生产了三百四十万吨钢、二百六十万吨钢材、四百多万吨铁矿砂、五十亿度电力、六亿多米纺织品，以及其他许多产品。
    在基本建设方面，从1959年年初到今年9月，苏联共建成了一千五百多个拥有新式装备的工业企业；平均每二十天就有五个工业企业落成和投入生产。其中，有不少企业是提前几个月甚至提前一年以上建成并投入生产的。
    苏联工业战线上的所有这些成就，是广大职工不断发挥劳动热情和创造精神的结果。
    从去年年初以来，苏联各地的工业劳动者就热烈地展开了社会主义竞赛，争取提前完成七年计划。竞赛运动日益深入，竞赛形式和内容越来越丰富。在运动中不断出现了不少充满共产主义精神的新人新事。两年前，在莫斯科—梁赞铁路调车站发起的“共产主义劳动队”运动，目前已经遍及全国，“按共产主义方式劳动、工作和学习！”已经成为七百多万职工的共同行动口号。继这个运动之后，苏联又出现了由著名纺织女工加干诺娃发起的“先进帮落后”运动。到目前为止，全国已有四万多人响应了加干诺娃的倡议，他们不计较个人得失，自愿帮助别的工作队、劳动集体或个人达到先进水平。今年以来，苏联各地又掀起了经济区对经济区、共和国对共和国的竞赛热潮。许多企业都建立了相互支援、共同提高的紧密关系。由于广大职工在这些运动和竞赛中不断发掘生产潜力、彼此协作和互相帮助，许多工厂企业近两年来不断提前完成生产任务，一次又一次地提出更高的生产指标。例如，在鞑靼油田，阿兹纳卡耶夫钻探局的所有的工作队在今年8月以前就超额完成了七年计划头两年的生产计划。他们进一步提出，要力争在三年内，而不是过去原定的五年内提前完成整个七年计划。
    将近两年来，苏联广大职工更加积极地参加了改进生产和提高技术的工作。到目前为止，全苏联已有二百八十多万职工参加了发明家和合理化建议者的行列。他们从七年计划开始执行的时候到今年9月底，总共提出了六百多万项改进生产的建议。这些建议促进了工业生产技术的进步和全面机械化和自动化水平的提高。两年来，苏联各地工业企业已经有几千条自动化、半自动化作业线和流水作业线投入生产。今年，各地生产的高度精密机床、自动化和半自动化作业线、控制仪器和计算机器比去年增加三分之一以上。
    在不断加快发展速度和超额完成计划的情况下，现在，苏联各地有许多工人、车间和工厂以及不少地区，已经提前达到了七年计划原定几年后的生产水平或其他指标。例如，到今年10月初，斯维德洛夫斯克经济区已经有六十五个工厂提前达到了1962年的生产水平，七个工厂达到了1964年的水平，二十三个工厂达到了1965年的水平。基洛夫经济区在十月革命节前夕，也传来了全区的工业劳动生产率提前达到1962年的水平的喜讯。
    据苏联报刊报道，根据将近两年来的情况，到今年年底苏联工业总产值差不多将比1958年增加23％，而不是七年计划原定的17％。这样一来，七年计划为工业规定的增长80％的生产任务，将有可能在六年内实现。到七年计划结束时，全国工业总产值将可以提高一倍左右。
