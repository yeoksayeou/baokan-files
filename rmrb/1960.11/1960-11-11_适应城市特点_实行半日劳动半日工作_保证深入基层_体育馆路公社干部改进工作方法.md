    Adapting to Urban Characteristics, Implementing Half-Day Labor and Half-Day Work to Ensure Deep Immersion in Grassroots:
    Tiyuguan Road Commune Cadres Improve Working Methods
    (Our Dispatch) The Party Committee of the Tiyuguan Road People's Commune in Chongwen District, Beijing, in light of the characteristics of the city, is promoting the method of half-day labor and half-day work. A large number of commune cadres are going deep into commune-run factories, canteens, childcare organizations, and service stations, powerfully promoting the development of various undertakings of the commune.
    In order to change the working methods of some cadres who were accustomed to working in street offices before the establishment of the commune, such as holding meetings at every turn and being tied up in routine work all day long, the Party Committee of the Tiyuguan Road People's Commune, based on the spirit of the "two-five system" and combined with the relatively concentrated production and collective living service units and convenient transportation in urban communes, formulated a new set of working methods. In one week, in addition to one day for study, two days for meetings, and handling daily work, commune leading cadres ensure four half-days to go deep into the grassroots, focusing on leading production, assigning responsibility for staying at selected points, and grasping key issues to find experience. General commune cadres, in addition to study time, all implement a system of half-day labor and half-day work. In order to go deep into the grassroots, all cadres go to the street residents' canteens and commune-run factory canteens to eat with the members at the same table.
    After the commune improved its working methods and leadership style, it realized "three grasps and one deep immersion." From the commune party secretary to the general cadres, all can grasp ideology, production, and life, deeply immersed in the front line of production and life service units, making the leadership work more accurate and deeper, effectively solving problems, and continuously promoting the leap forward of various tasks of the commune. Party Secretary Liu Mai stayed at the commune hat factory, and when she couldn't get factory management personnel to talk about the problems, she immediately ran to the workshop to participate in production. During labor, she saw that two production personnel were doing rework all day long and were too busy to handle it, so she further inspected and found that the quality of the hats did not meet the standards. She immediately found experienced workers and inspectors sent by large factories to jointly study and formulate measures to improve product quality. Since then, in addition to announcing the quality of the day's products to the production personnel every morning and afternoon, each workshop has also established quality inspectors, conservation supervisors, and output measurers who do not leave production, strengthening the supervision and inspection of product quality, so that the pass rate of the main product, the leather portable hat, increased from about 80% in the past to more than 95%. Liu Mai then seized this typical example to conduct ideological education in the factory, correcting the mood of some management personnel who were satisfied with the status quo in production. After Deputy Party Secretary Zhao Shu went deep into the canteens and service stations, he grasped the situation more timely and specifically, and discovered some problems that he had not heard when sitting in the office listening to reports, so that the leadership work was well-informed. When he went to the Sixth Management District, he found that two service stations were busy and idle, so he immediately held discussions with the service personnel. It turned out that the two service stations were too close to each other, and there was insufficient source of work. After research, it was determined that the two service stations should be merged, the number of service personnel reduced by half, and the work efficiency increased by more than double, so that the masses could get better and faster disassembly, washing, sewing, and other services.
    Because the commune's leading cadres took the lead and set an example in improving working methods and leadership style, they also greatly promoted the management personnel of commune-run factories and collective living service units to strengthen management work in a thorough and meticulous manner, and further promoted the in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement. The party branch secretary and factory director of the commune goggle factory both participated in labor in the workshop and solved problems on the spot when they encountered them. When factory director Jia Xinchou was working in the yarn bucket workshop, he found that the production personnel's experimental improvement of the operating technology for making goggle edges was very good, and he immediately adopted and promoted it. As a result, two processes were saved, and the number of production personnel in each shift was reduced from 23 in the past to one, and 100 kilograms of flour were saved every month. Because the commune-run factories were scattered and the factory headquarters and workshops were far apart, they are now moved together. The branch secretary and factory director are assigned to different workshops, eat and work with the production personnel, and rush to do dirty and hard work, which greatly encourages the masses. Due to the strengthening of production management, the factory's production of 11 kinds of small commodities such as belt oil and laundry detergent has exceeded the production plan every month in the past two months.
    After the commune's cadres went down to lead production in a down-to-earth manner and arranged the masses' lives in a thorough and meticulous manner, a new atmosphere of "two more and two less" appeared in the entire commune. There are more commune leading cadres going deep into the front line and fewer squatting in the office; there is more on-site investigation and research and fewer office report meetings. In the current movement to increase production and practice economy, the commune's production has also shown a good situation, and the output, quality, variety and specifications of products have also been improved.

    适应城市特点　实行半日劳动半日工作　保证深入基层
    体育馆路公社干部改进工作方法
    本报讯　北京市崇文区体育馆路人民公社党委结合城市的特点，推行半日劳动半日工作的方法，大批公社干部深入社办工厂、食堂、托儿组织和服务站，有力地促进公社各项事业的发展。
    体育馆路人民公社党委为了改变部分干部习惯公社成立前在街道办事处的工作方法，遇事就开会，整天忙于事务工作脱不开身等情况，根据“二五制”的精神，结合城市公社生产和集体生活服务单位比较集中和交通方便等特点，制定出一套新的工作方法。公社领导干部在一周内，除一天学习、两天开会和处理日常工作外，保证有四个半天深入基层，以领导生产为中心，分工蹲点，抓关键找经验。公社一般干部在学习时间外都实行半日劳动半日工作的制度。为了深入基层，全体干部分别到街道居民食堂和社办工厂食堂入伙，和社员们一桌吃饭。
    这个公社改进了工作方法和领导作风以后，实现了“三抓一深入”，从公社党委书记到一般干部都能做到抓思想抓生产又抓生活，深入生产和生活服务单位第一线，使领导工作愈抓愈准，愈抓愈深，切实解决问题，推动公社各项工作不断跃进。党委书记刘迈到公社制帽厂蹲点，找工厂管理人员谈不出问题，一下子就跑到车间里参加生产。她在劳动中看见有两个生产人员整天做返修活都忙不过来，就进一步检查，发现了制帽质量没有达到指标，当场就找老师傅和大厂派来的检查员共同研究，订出改进产品质量的措施。从此，各车间除每天上下午向生产人员公布当天产品质量情况外，还建立不脱离生产的质量检查员、节约监督员和计产员等，加强了产品质量的督促检查，使这个厂的主要产品皮便式帽的合格率由过去的80％左右提高到95％以上。刘迈又抓住这个典型事例，在工厂进行思想教育，纠正一些管理人员对待生产满足现状的情绪。党委副书记赵书深入食堂和服务站以后，掌握情况更及时更具体，发现一些过去坐在办公室听汇报时没听到的问题，使领导工作做到心中有数。他到第六管理区发现两个服务站一忙一闲，立即找服务员座谈。原来是由于两个服务站距离较近，活源不足。经过研究后，确定两个服务站合并，服务人员减少一半，工作效率提高了一倍以上，为群众拆洗缝补和其他服务工作做得更好更快了。
    由于公社领导干部以身作则，在改进工作方法和领导作风方面作出了榜样，也大大促进了社办工厂和集体生活服务单位的管理人员深入细致地加强管理工作，进一步推动增产节约运动深入展开。公社风镜厂的党支部书记和厂长都到车间参加劳动，遇到问题就当场解决。厂长贾辛丑在纱斗车间劳动时，发现生产人员试验改进做风镜边的操作技术很好，马上采纳推广，结果省去两道工序，每班生产人员由过去二十三人减少到一人操作，每月还节约一百斤面粉。公社所办工厂因厂房分散，厂部和车间距离较远，现在也搬到一起。支部书记和厂长分工包片下车间，和生产人员同吃同劳动，遇到脏活累活都抢着干，给群众很大的鼓舞。这个厂由于加强生产管理，生产的皮带油、洗衣粉等十一种小商品，近两个月都月月超额完成生产计划。
    这个公社的干部踏踏实实地下去领导生产，深入细致地安排群众生活后，全公社出现了“两多两少”的新气象。公社领导干部深入第一线多了，蹲在办公室少了；现场调查研究多了，机关汇报会议少了。在当前的增产节约运动中，公社生产又出现了一派大好形势，产品的产量、质量和品种规格也都有了提高。（附图片）
