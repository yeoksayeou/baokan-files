    Jiangxi Provincial Library's Practice is Good
    Qin Li

    The publication of Volume Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is a major event in the political life of the people of the whole country. People are eagerly and eagerly reading and studying Chairman Mao's works, but due to printing and distribution reasons, it is not possible to have a copy for everyone for the time being.
    The Jiangxi Provincial Library in Nanchang City has a good practice that is supported and praised by the masses. In the public reading room, ten copies of Volume Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" are prepared for the masses to read in the reading room. Studying the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" by only borrowing and reading in the library's reading room is naturally far from enough. However, this can first meet the urgent needs of the masses who have not yet bought the book and those who are out and about without the book, and it can also make full use of these ten books, providing them for more people to read. We have personally seen that in this reading room, these ten books are almost constantly being borrowed and read by readers in turn. And everyone reads so carefully and conscientiously, loathe to put them down, until it is time to go to work or stop reading, when they reluctantly return them.
    Preparing ten books for readers is no small matter. From this, we can see that the comrades of the Jiangxi Provincial Library conscientiously regard studying and disseminating Mao Zedong Thought as their glorious duty. They think of the masses in everything and regard satisfying the greatest desires and urgent needs of the masses as their own work criteria and as their own happiness.

    江西省图书馆的做法好
    秦犁
    《毛泽东选集》第四卷的出版，是全国人民政治生活中的一件大事。人们如饥似渴、争先恐后地阅读和学习毛主席的著作，但是，由于印刷、发行的关系，一时还不能做到人手一册。
    南昌市的江西省图书馆有个受到群众拥护和赞扬的好做法。在公共阅览室里准备了十本《毛泽东选集》第四卷，借给群众在阅览室阅读。学习《毛泽东选集》，仅靠在图书馆的阅览室里借阅，自然是很不够的。但是，这样做，可以先满足一时还没有买到这本书的和出门在外没有这本书的群众的迫切要求，又可以使这十本书得到充分的利用，供给更多的人阅读。我们就亲眼看到，在这个阅览室里，这十册书几乎轮流不息地被读者借阅着。而且每个人又都是读得那么仔细认真，手不释卷，直到要去上班或者停止阅览的时候，才依依不舍地归还。
    为读者准备十本书，这不是一件小事。从这里可以看到，江西省图书馆的工作同志认真地把学习、传播毛泽东思想作为自己的光荣职责，他们处处为群众着想，把满足群众的最大愿望和迫切需要，当作自己的工作准则，当作自己的幸福。
