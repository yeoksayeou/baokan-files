Adapting to the Leap Forward Requires Continuously Improving the Level of Basic-Level Cadres

Xing Guangxin, Secretary of the Yutianpu Coal Mine Committee of the Communist Party of China in Chongqing

Constantly paying attention to improving the political and ideological level and professional work ability of basic-level cadres is an extremely important political and organizational task of our Party. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "To guide a great revolution, there must be a great party and many of the best cadres," "Therefore, the planned training of a large number of new cadres is our fighting task."

Strive to form a basic-level cadre team that is ideologically advanced, full of drive, and closely connected with the masses

This year, the entire national economy is in a state of continuous leap forward, and the tasks of socialist construction and industrial production place higher and higher demands on cadres, and the required number is also increasing; especially the Party's basic-level cadres, not only are large in number and widely distributed, but also live and produce together with the masses. They are the link between the Party and the masses, the bridge between conveying directives from above and reporting situations from below. They are both the implementers of the Party's line, principles, and policies, and the direct leaders and organizers of the production, life, and education of the workers and masses. Therefore, the level of the political and ideological quality of basic-level cadres and the strength of their professional work ability play a decisive role in the success or failure of production work.

In order to adapt to the needs of production development, we have used various methods to cultivate and improve the political ideology, cultural and technical level, and leadership ability of basic-level cadres. At the same time, through the continuous leap forward of production and the exercise of various central movements, we have carefully selected a group of basic-level leading backbones from the ranks of workers. The number of cadres at all levels and of all types above the rank of squad and team leader promoted from workers in the entire mine accounted for 71% of the total number of cadres in the mine. They are distributed in various aspects such as the Party, the Trade Union, the Communist Youth League, administration, and technology. The vast majority of these cadres from worker backgrounds are ideologically advanced, full of drive, firm in their stance, selfless, and closely connected with the masses. They have revolutionary ambitions and a down-to-earth work style; they set an example in production and work, and they are not afraid of difficulties. Wherever the Party points, they rush there, thus effectively promoting the continuous high yield of coal and coke in our mine this year.

The grassroots and grassroots cadres are important links in implementing the Party's policies. Strengthening the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job at the grassroots level.

Where do we start with vigorously cultivating and improving basic-level cadres? We believe that there are many ways, but the central link is to start with production teams and improve the leadership level of team cadres.

The production team is not only the foothold for industrial and mining enterprises to do all their work in a solid manner, but also a primary school for cultivating and training cadres. It is often said: a thousand threads from above, a needle below. The needle: is the team. Going straight to the end, the end is the team, and more specifically, it is the branch secretary, team leader and squad leader of the team. Here, they have to manage production, grasp ideological work, safety, life, and cultural learning. They have to manage everything and manage it well. This is the characteristic of team work, a favorable place for cultivating and training basic-level cadres, and also a good place to comprehensively improve the leadership level of basic-level cadres.

The most important thing in grasping team work is to establish and improve the Party's leadership core in the team. The organizational form of our mine's Party branch used to be one Party branch leading several teams (a production team is a working face, generally with about one hundred people, divided into three shifts for production). In this way, it is difficult to give full play to the role of the Party branch as a fighting fortress. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over production, we established Party branches by production team and Party groups by shift. In shifts where Party groups could not be established temporarily, we also generally established a leading core for the shift with Party members as the main body. In this way, each production team and shift has a strong leadership core, which effectively guarantees production, and also plays a great role in solving the living problems of workers and uniting and educating the broad masses of workers.

Whether the Party's core leadership is strong and whether the leadership of production teams and shifts is in the hands of advanced elements is very important. In the past, some people neglected politics and focused on technology when selecting cadres. In some shifts and teams, the ideology of the masses was confused and discipline was lax because the leaders did not put politics in command, and the team work was listless and often failed to complete the plan. In view of this situation, in the process of establishing the leading core of the team and group, we adjusted those who did not put politics in command and lacked drive according to their respective circumstances. For example, the original eleventh coal mining team of our mine's third well had a team leader and a squad leader who were both so-called technically skilled cadres, but they did not put politics in command. When the team work achieved results, they said it was because they were "technically good," and when production was not doing well, they said it was because "the masses did not listen." Such teams and shifts failed to complete the plan month after month. Later, we went deep into this team to work, and according to the demands of the masses, we replaced these two "experts" and selected a group of cadres with both ability and political integrity to establish and improve the leading core of the team and shift. They were full of drive and vigor, relied on the masses everywhere, and quickly became advanced teams and shifts. Under the same production conditions, production rose sharply, and they overfulfilled the plan month after month and won the red flag for large-area bumper harvest. At any time, selecting cadres without looking at political and ideological conditions and simply looking at "skills" does not conform to the Party's cadre conditions. Cadres with poor quality and style are placed in the team and group, which not only block the Party's path to the masses, but also block the masses' path to the Party, blocking our vision and hearing. We must always remember the principle of "appointing people on their merits."

Learning while doing and doing while learning, and cultivating and training in actual work are effective methods to improve basic-level cadres

After having a group of basic-level cadres, "our responsibility lies in organizing them, training them, caring for them, and being good at using them" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Vol. 2, p. 514). There are also two kinds of thinking and two kinds of methods here. Some people use cadres only to let them "know what it is," but do not pay attention to letting them "know why it is." In this way, cadres cannot improve their ideological level for a long time. Some people cultivate cadres, but are only satisfied with talking on paper, and do not cultivate, train, and examine them through actual production work. In this way, even cadres who originally had relatively rich practical work experience will inevitably be contaminated with the problem of "being top-heavy" and become people who are divorced from reality and do not understand business. Both of these biases must be prevented. We have personally experienced from actual work that the correct approach is: learning while doing and doing while learning. Just as Comrade Mao Zedong taught us, "Learning warfare through warfare—this is our main method."

Supplementing what is lacking and comprehensively improving political ideology, cultural and technical level, and leadership ability

In view of the characteristics of basic-level cadres who have practical work experience and are familiar with production business, but have a low level of political theory and culture, we adopted the method of supplementing what is lacking to vigorously improve their political ideology, cultural and technical level, and leadership ability.

First, universally organize cadres and workers to study Chairman Mao's works. Cadres throughout the mine insist on studying for seven hours a week, and set up worker red and expert study rooms centered on workshops and dormitories, and organized more than 100 theoretical study groups on Chairman Mao's works, adopting the method of studying what is done to make cadres' political theory study serve the needs of the Party's central tasks and production work. For example: In the technical revolution movement, we organized cadres and workers to study Chairman Mao's expositions on the technical revolution and documents such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains"; in the rectification movement, we organized workers to study "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Contradiction," "On Practice," "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Working Methods," and "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" and other works. At the same time, we also closely combined the study of the instructions of the higher-level Party committees on various tasks and the approved documents of the higher-level Party committees on our mine's summary of work experience at various times. These are concrete applications of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Studying these instructions can most effectively improve the ideological and political level of cadres. At the same time, the theories of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works are the guiding ideology for our Party to formulate all policies and principles. Studying the theory can help cadres understand the Party's policies and principles more deeply, and they will be more clear-minded and know why when they do their work. Through learning while doing, our cadres at all levels have gradually recognized and mastered the objective laws of coal mine production, and have a relatively deep understanding of the inherent connection and proportional relationship between the various links of coal mine production, such as mining, tunneling, transportation, washing, refining, and safety. Because the various production links have the characteristics of mutual promotion and mutual restriction, it is necessary to organize high yields of tunneling and transportation when organizing high yields of coal mining, and safety production can be achieved in all links of mining, tunneling, and transportation, so as to ensure the continuous high yield of recovery with tunneling, transportation, and safety. After recognizing and mastering these objective laws, cadres at all levels can consciously implement the Party's policy of walking on two legs and the principle of simultaneous mining, tunneling, transportation, and safety in their work, fully exert people's subjective initiative, rationally deploy forces, break through weak links, and master the initiative of production.

Second, enliven the Party's democratic life and give full play to the enthusiasm of Party members and cadres. "The creation of a large number of capable talents is also possible only in democratic life" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Vol. 2, p. 517). When we implement the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, we must expand all meetings that should be expanded and call as many basic-level cadres as possible to participate, going straight to the end. When discussing work at the meeting, we combine the virtual and the real and explain the Party's policies and principles in depth and thoroughly. We have learned that in the use of basic-level cadres, on the one hand, we must grasp tightly in terms of policies and principles, which is convenient for unifying thinking, unifying actions, and ensuring the implementation of the Party's instructions and resolutions. On the other hand, we must boldly let them do it in actual work, so that they dare to be responsible, can actively combine the Party's policies and principles with specific actual conditions, give play to their initiative and creativity, make the work lively and vigorous, and cultivate and improve independent work ability.

Third, according to the method of supplementing what is lacking, run various training classes to quickly improve the cultural and technical level and political level of basic-level cadres. We ran year-round amateur education around the central work of production, and initially formed an amateur education network from elementary school to university. Amateur schools are an important form of organizing the vast number of workers to learn politics, culture, and science and technology. In addition, we also ran various professional training classes, technical schools, Party schools, Youth League schools, and red and expert universities at various times according to the different characteristics of basic-level cadres, and trained a large number of cadres and technical workers. Among the students who graduated this year alone, 78 reached the university level, 338 reached the secondary vocational school level, 708 reached the junior technical school level, and 3,966 reached the junior high school level, and the illiteracy among young and middle-aged workers has been basically eliminated. Through various training classes and amateur education, many basic-level cadres and old workers have not only greatly improved their cultural and technical level, but also improved their leadership ability.

Fourth, constantly sum up experience and constantly improve leadership level. This year, we have insisted that every task has arrangements, inspections, and summaries, and improved the level of basic-level cadres by summarizing and inspecting work. The specific method is: to carry out the "five-good" evaluation competition among basic-level cadres (that is, good political command, good implementation of the Party's policies and principles, good completion of tasks, good labor, good contact with the masses, good study), implement squad-by-squad inspection and evaluation, summarize experience in one battle and one small summary, one month and one summary of experience exchange, insert red flags, and set up pacesetters. At the same time, we also hold symposiums for basic-level cadres from time to time to ask them to talk about their experiences and lessons learned, summarize and inspect work, or the Party committee personally organizes forces to various workshops to summarize the political and ideological work and management work experience of basic-level cadres. Concentrating the bits and pieces of experience in practice, matching them into sets, and then persisting in them, through the method of practice-summing up improvement-practice, we have gradually formed a complete set of management systems for our mine's cadres, such as "four togethers", office work in the mine, political work "three downs" (down to the mine, down to the workshop, down to the kitchen), team covenants, and cadre production command responsibility system. This is the product of the mass line, and it is also the collective creation of cadres at all levels in our mine. At the same time, this also marks the further improvement of the leadership level of basic-level cadres in our mine.

In order to do a better job in cultivating basic-level cadres, we are currently further studying Chairman Mao's works. We will firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching to us: "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is more important learning" ("Strategic Issues in China's Revolutionary War"), adhere to the principle of unity of learning and application, and make our production and work better and more outstanding.

    适应跃进需要不断提高基层干部水平
    中共重庆市鱼田堡煤矿委员会书记　邢广信
    经常注意提高基层干部的政治思想水平和业务工作能力，是我们党的一项极为重要的政治任务和组织任务。毛泽东同志教导我们：“指导伟大的革命，要有伟大的党，要有许多最好的干部”，“因此，有计划的培养大批新干部，就是我们的战斗任务”。
    为形成一支思想先进、干劲十足、和群众有着密切联系的基层干部队伍而努力
    今年，整个国民经济正在持续跃进，社会主义建设和工业生产的任务，对干部的要求越来越高，需要的数量也越来越大；尤其是党的基层干部，不仅数量大，分布面广，而且同群众生产、生活在一起，他们是党同群众联系的纽带，是上情下达、下情上达的桥梁，既是党的路线、方针、政策的执行者，又是职工群众生产、生活、教育的直接领导者和组织者。因此，基层干部政策思想水平的高低，业务工作能力的强弱，对于生产工作的好坏起着决定性的作用。
    为了适应生产发展的需要，我们运用了各种方法，培养提高基层干部的政治思想、文化技术水平与领导工作能力。同时通过生产的持续跃进和各项中心运动的锻炼，我们又从工人队伍中认真挑选了一批基层领导骨干，全矿从工人中培养提拔起来的班、组长以上的各级各类干部占全矿干部总数的71％。他们分布在党、工会、共青团、行政、技术等各个方面。这些工人出身的干部，绝大部分是思想先进，干劲十足，立场坚定，大公无私，和群众有着密切联系，具有革命的雄心大志和踏实苦干的工作作风的；他们在生产上在工作中，处处以身作则，起模范带头作用，不畏艰难，党指向那里就奔向那里，因而有力地促进了我矿今年煤焦的持续高产。
    基层和基层干部是贯彻党的方针政策的重要环节。加强党的领导，是做好基层工作的根本保证
    大力培养提高基层干部从什么地方着手呢？我们认为办法是多种多样的，但是中心环节是从生产小组着手，从提高小组干部领导水平着手。
    生产小组，不但是工矿企业扎扎实实做好一切工作的落脚点，同时也是培养锻炼干部的初级学校。常说：上面千条线，下面一根针。针：就是小组。一竿子到底，底就是小组，再具体些，就是小组的支部书记、小组长和班长。在这里，他们要管生产，要抓思想工作，安全、生活、文化学习，他们都得管，都得管好。这是小组工作的特点，是培养锻炼基层干部有利的地方，也是全面提高基层干部领导水平的好场所。
    抓小组工作，最重要的一条是建立健全小组党的领导核心。我矿党支部的组织形式，原来是一个党支部领导几个小组（一个生产小组就是一个工作面，一般有一百人左右，分三班进行生产）。这样就很难充分发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用。为了加强党对生产的领导，我们以生产小组为单位建立党支部，按班建立党小组，在暂时还不能建立党小组的班里，也普遍以党员为主建立班的领导核心，这样就使每个生产小组和班都有了坚强的领导核心，有力地保证了生产，同时在解决职工生活问题，团结教育广大职工群众也起了很大的作用。
    党的核心领导是否坚强，生产小组和班的领导权是否掌握在先进分子手里很关紧要。过去有些人选拔干部忽视政治，偏重技术，有些班、组由于领导人政治没有挂帅，群众思想混乱，纪律松弛，小组工作暮气沉沉，经常完不成计划。根据这种情况，我们在建立班组领导核心过程中，对那些政治不挂帅，干劲不足的人，都分别情况进行了调整。如我矿三井采煤十一组原有一个组长和一个班长，都是所谓技术很高的干部，但是他们政治不挂帅，小组工作有了成绩，就说是因为他们“技术好”，生产搞得不好就说是“群众不听话”。这样的组、班月月完不成计划。后来我们就深入到这个小组去做工作，根据群众要求，撤换了这两个“专家”，另挑选了一批德才兼备的干部，建立健全了组、班的领导核心以后，他们干劲十足，朝气蓬勃，处处依靠群众，迅速成为先进组、班。在同样的生产条件下，生产直线上升，月月超额完成计划，连续获得大面积丰产红旗。任何时候挑选干部不看政治思想条件，单纯看
  “本事”是不符合党的干部条件的。品质作风不好的干部摆在班、组里面，既挡着党通往群众的路，又挡着群众通往党的路，闭塞了我们的视听。“任人唯贤”这一条我们要永远牢记。
    边干边学，边学边干，在实际工作中培养锻炼，是提高基层干部的有效方法
    有了一批基层干部以后，“我们的责任，就在于组织他们，培养他们，爱护他们，并善于使用他们”（《毛泽东选集》二卷514页）。这里也存在两种思想两种方法的斗争。有些人使用干部，只让干部“知其然”，而不注意让干部“知其所以然”。这样，干部长期提不高思想水平。有些人培养干部，又只满足于纸上谈兵，不通过生产工作实际去培养锻炼他们、考察他们。这样，纵然是原来实际工作经验比较丰富的干部，最终也不免沾染上“头重脚轻”的毛病，落为脱离实际，不懂业务的人。这两种偏向都必须防止。我们从实际工作中亲身体会到，正确的作法是：边干边学，边学边干。也正如毛泽东同志教导我们的“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法”。
    缺什么补什么，政治思想、文化、技术水平和领导能力全面提高
    我们针对基层干部有实际工作经验，熟悉生产业务，但政治理论水平和文化水平不高的特点，采取缺啥补啥的办法，大力提高他们的政治思想、文化、技术水平和领导工作能力。
    第一、普遍组织干部和工人开展学习毛主席著作。全矿干部每周坚持学习七小时，并以工房宿舍为中心设立职工红专学习室，组织了百多个毛主席著作的理论学习小组，采取做什么学什么，使干部的政治理论学习为党的中心任务和生产工作的需要服务。比如：我们在技术革命运动中，就组织干部、工人学习毛主席论述技术革命和《愚公移山》等文件；在整风运动中，就组织职工学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《矛盾论》《实践论》《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》《关于领导方法的若干问题》等著作。与此同时，我们还紧密结合各个时期学习上级党对各项工作的指示和上级党批转我矿各项工作经验总结的批示文件，这些是马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的具体运用，有虚有实，学习这些指示，就能最有效地提高干部思想政治水平。同时，马克思列宁主义的理论和毛主席的著作，又是我党制订一切方针政策的指导思想，学习了理论就能帮助干部更深刻地领会党的方针政策，做起工作来心中就更加亮堂，知其所以然。通过边学边干，使我们各级干部逐步认识和掌握了煤矿生产的客观规律，对煤矿生产内部的采、掘、运、洗、炼、安全等各个环节之间的内在联系和比例关系，有了较为深刻的认识。由于各个生产环节之间有着互相促进，互相制约的特点，因此在组织采煤高产的时候，必须组织掘进、运输的高产，而且在采、掘、运各个环节上都能做到安全生产，以掘进、运输和安全来保证回采的持续高产。认识和掌握到这些客观规律以后，各级干部在工作中都能自觉地贯彻执行党的两条腿走路和采、掘、运、安全同时并举的方针，充分发挥人的主观能动性，合理部署力量，攻破薄弱环节，掌握生产主动权。
    第二、活跃党的民主生活，充分发挥党员和干部的积极性。“大批能干人材的创造，也只有在民主生活中才有可能”（《毛泽东选集》二卷517页）。我们在贯彻上级党委指示的时候，凡是应该扩大的会议，一定扩大，尽可能多地叫基层干部参加，一竿子到底。在开会研究工作的时候，虚实结合，把党的方针政策讲深讲透。我们体会到，对基层干部的使用，一方面要在政策原则上抓得紧，便于统一思想，统一行动，保证党的指示、决议的贯彻执行。另一方面，在实际工作中大胆放手让他们去做，使他们敢于负责，能够主动地把党的政策、方针与具体实际情况结合起来，发挥他们的积极性、创造性，把工作做得生动活泼，培养提高独立工作能力。
    第三、根据缺啥补啥的办法，开办各种训练班，迅速提高基层干部的文化技术水平和政治水平。我们围绕生产中心工作大办常年的业余教育，初步形成了从小学直到大学的业余教育网。业余学校是组织广大职工学习政治、文化和科学技术的重要形式。此外，我们还针对基层干部的不同特点，在各个时期开办了各种专业训练班，技术学校、党校、团校和红专大学等，培训了大量的干部和技术工人，仅今年毕业的学员中，达到大学水平的有七十八个，达到中等专业学校水平的有三百三十八人，达到初级技术学校水平的有七百零八人，达到初中水平的有三千九百六十六人，并已基本扫除了青壮年职工中的文盲。通过各种训练班和业余教育，许多基层干部和老工人不仅大大提高了文化、技术水平，而且还提高了领导工作能力。
    第四、不断总结经验，不断提高领导水平。今年来，我们坚持了每项工作都有布置、有检查、有总结，通过总结检查工作来提高基层干部的水平。具体作法是：在基层干部中开展
  “五好”评比竞赛（即政治挂帅、贯彻执行党的方针政策好，完成任务好，劳动好，联系群众好，学习好），实行班班检查评比，一战役一小结，一月一总结交流经验，插红旗，树标兵。与此同时，我们还不定期地召开基层干部座谈会，叫他们谈心得体会，总结检查工作，或者由党委亲自组织力量去各车间总结基层干部的政治思想工作和管理工作经验。把实践中的点滴经验集中起来，配成套，再坚持下去，通过实践——总结提高——实践的办法，逐步形成了我矿干部“四同”、井下办公、政治工作
  “三下”（下矿井、下工房、下厨房）、小组公约、干部生产指挥责任制等一整套管理制度，这是群众路线的产物，也是我矿各级干部的集体创造，同时这也标志着我矿基层干部领导水平的进一步提高。
    为了把培养基层干部的工作做得更好，目前我们正进一步学习毛主席的著作。我们将牢牢地记住毛主席教导我们的：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习”（《中国革命战争的战略问题》），坚持学用一致的原则，把我们的生产、工作搞得更好更出色。
