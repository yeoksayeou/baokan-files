    Supporting Angang – A Supremely Glorious Task
    Over 700 Large and Small Enterprises and Transportation Departments Nationwide Strive to Ensure the Steel City Produces More Steel
    (Reported by the Anshan Daily) The broad masses of people across the country are enthusiastically concerned about steel production in the steel capital and are doing everything possible to support Angang in producing more steel. Currently, nearly 80,000 tons of over 10,000 types of raw materials, fuels, refractory materials, chemical materials, and mechanical equipment are continuously transported to Anshan from all corners of the country by more than 1,800 freight cars every day.
    From Guangdong in the southernmost part of the country to Heilongjiang in the northernmost part, from Jiangsu on the coast of the East China Sea to Baotou in Inner Mongolia, more than 700 large and small enterprises in 15 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are supporting Angang's production. The workers of these enterprises regard supporting Angang as a supremely glorious task. They would rather keep the difficulties for themselves and provide convenience for Angang. The workers of the Liguo Iron Mine in Jiangsu Province launched a competition to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and help each other. They overcame the difficulties of the rainy season and completed the production task of open-hearth ore for supporting Angang five days ahead of schedule in October. After receiving the task of supporting Angang with 10,000 tons of open-hearth ore in October, the Lingxiang Iron Mine in Hubei Province postponed other tasks and concentrated its efforts on producing high-quality open-hearth ore for Angang. The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant regarded the processing of demolding cranes for Angang as the most important task. Many workers ate and slept in the factory. After the processing task was completed, they also sent technicians to Anshan to help with installation.
    In order to support Angang, the relevant enterprises not only vigorously increased production but also strived to improve quality. In order to improve the quality of open-hearth ore, the miners of the Lingxiang Iron Mine in Hubei Province recently took resolute measures to strictly control three checkpoints: controlling the particle size of the ore, controlling loading, and controlling transportation, so that the quality of open-hearth ore was improved by 2.6% compared with the plan.
    Under the slogan of "Transport as much as there is, transport as soon as it is produced, and transport as soon as it arrives," the relevant transportation departments across the country mobilized a large number of trains, ships, trucks, horse-drawn carts, and handcarts to transport materials for Angang, and sometimes even dispatched airplanes. Dalian Port improved transportation methods, so that materials transported to Dalian by ships were directly loaded onto trains and transported to Anshan in a timely manner; if there were insufficient vehicles, priority was given to supplying Angang. The workers of the Fuxin Railway and Mining Bureau launched a vigorous campaign to implement dragon-networked transportation, compiling coal cars bound for Angang into "steel dragons," which were directly driven from Fuxin to Anshan, greatly shortening the travel time. Recently, Angang launched a campaign to excavate scrap steel and urgently needed some trucks to transport scrap steel. Upon hearing the news, the Liaoning Provincial Department of Transportation sent 20 trucks to support.
    The strong support of the people across the country has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of Angang's workers and created favorable conditions for Angang's production. In order to thank the people across the country for their support with practical actions, Angang's workers are exerting even greater efforts and striving to win the final victory in this year's steel production with the most outstanding achievements.

    支援鞍钢——头等光荣的任务
    全国七百多个大小企业和运输部门力保钢都多炼钢
    本报讯　据鞍山日报消息：全国各地广大人民热情关心钢都生产，千方百计支援鞍钢多产钢铁。现在，每天有近八万吨万余种原料、燃料、耐火材料、化工材料和机械设备，由一千八百多辆货车从祖国的四面八方源源运来鞍山。
    从祖国最南端的广东，到祖国最北部的黑龙江，从东海之滨的江苏到内蒙古的包头，全国有十五个省、市、区的七百多个大小企业支援鞍钢的生产。这些企业的职工们把支援鞍钢看成是头等光荣的任务，他们宁肯把困难留给自己也要把方便让给鞍钢。江苏省利国铁矿职工开展学比赶帮竞赛，战胜雨季困难，10月份提前五天完成了支援鞍钢的平炉矿生产任务。湖北省灵乡铁矿10月份接到支援鞍钢一万吨平炉矿的任务以后，推迟了其他任务，集中力量为鞍钢生产了优质的平炉矿。太原重型机械厂把为鞍钢加工脱模吊车当做最重要的任务，许多职工在厂里吃、在厂里睡；加工任务完成后，还派技术人员到鞍钢帮助安装。
    为了支援鞍钢，各有关企业不仅大力提高产量，还努力提高质量。为了提高平炉矿的质量，湖北省灵乡铁矿的矿工们最近采取坚决措施，严格控制三道关口：控制矿石粒度，控制装车，控制运输，使平炉矿的质量比计划提高了2.6％。
    全国各有关运输部门在“有多少运多少，随产随运，随到随运”的口号下，调动了大量的火车、船舶、汽车、马车、手推车为鞍钢运输物资，有时还出动了飞机。大连港改进运输方法，使经过船舶运到大连的物资直接装上火车及时运到鞍山；如果车辆不足，则优先供应鞍钢。阜新路矿职工大闹龙网化运输，把运往鞍钢的煤车编成“钢龙”，由阜新直接开往鞍山，大大缩短了运行时间。最近，鞍钢开展挖掘废钢铁运动，迫切需要一部分汽车运输废钢铁，辽宁省交通厅闻讯派出二十辆汽车支援。
    全国人民的大力支援，大大鼓舞了鞍钢职工的生产热情，为鞍钢的生产创造了有利条件。为了以实际行动感谢全国人民的支援，鞍钢职工正鼓足更大干劲，力争以最出色的成就，夺取今年钢铁生产的最后胜利。
