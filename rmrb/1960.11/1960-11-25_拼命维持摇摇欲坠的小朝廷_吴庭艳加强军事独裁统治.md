Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 24th: Saigon dispatch: The Ngo Dinh Diem clique, becoming even more panicked and frantic after the Saigon coup, in order to desperately maintain its crumbling and corrupt rule, issued an order on the 22nd, deciding to recall reserve officers to active duty and to place 50,000 "Civil Guard" members under the control of the "Ministry of National Defense."

According to a report by United Press International, the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet authorities' order announced that the "Ministry of National Defense" will manage the reorganization, training, and equipping of the "Civil Guard," which is used to carry out rural police tasks.

The reactionary local armed force "Civil Guard" of South Vietnam was originally commanded by the "Ministry of Interior" and trained and equipped by the "Public Security Department" of the American "Military Assistance Advisory Group." Since the Saigon coup, Ngo Dinh Diem has been worried that his American masters would replace him, this old horse, who has become extremely unpopular.

At the same time, the pseudo "Deputy Minister of National Defense" Nguyen Dinh Thuan said that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique might declare a state of emergency in South Vietnam.

    拼命维持摇摇欲坠的小朝廷
    吴庭艳加强军事独裁统治
    新华社河内24日电　西贡消息：在西贡政变以后变得更加恐慌和疯狂的吴庭艳集团，为了拼命维持其摇摇欲坠的腐朽统治，22日又发布命令，决定征召后备役军官重新服现役，并且把五万名“民卫队”置于“国防部”的控制之下。
    据合众国际社报道，吴庭艳傀儡当局的命令宣布，“国防部”将管理被用来执行农村警察任务的“民卫队”的改组、训练和装备问题。
    南越的反动地方武装“民卫队”原来由“内政部”指挥，由美国“军事援助顾问团”的“公共安全部”训练和装备。西贡政变发生以后，吴庭艳一直担心他的美国主子要把他这匹已经十分不得人心的老马换掉。
    同时，伪“国防部”副部长阮廷淳说，吴庭艳集团可能宣布南越处于紧急状态。
