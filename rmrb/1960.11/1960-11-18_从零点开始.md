    Starting from Zero O'Clock
    Grasp tightly from zero o'clock all the way to twenty-four o'clock
    —Excerpts from the "Metallurgical News" Editorial
    Metallurgical News Reporter
    During the Great Leap Forward, a very important leadership experience we gained was to grasp things tightly from the beginning and maintain that grip throughout. Embodied in the production leadership of each day, the "beginning" is zero o'clock, and the "end" is twenty-four o'clock. We must grasp things tightly from zero o'clock and continue until twenty-four o'clock, ensuring shift output with furnace output, daily output with shift output, and monthly output with daily output. Wherever this is done, production is invariably good. However, some enterprises do not do this. In their case, the first shift's output is the lowest, the second shift's output is slightly higher, and the third shift's output is the highest, often equaling the combined output of the first two shifts. Why is there such a vast difference in output despite the same eight hours? Aside from the fact that darkness during the first shift makes operations less convenient than during the day, causing some difficulties, the most important reason is the relatively weak leadership and the lack of a tight grip. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain why the third shift, which also produces for a significant portion of the night, can achieve such high output.
    Seizing the production of the first shift essentially means taking the initiative in production and avoiding passivity. It allows for the early arrangement of production tasks for all three shifts of the day, striving to complete more during the first and second shifts, so that the third shift can free up time to prepare for the next day's production. Moreover, should an accident occur, it can be handled promptly, turning major problems into minor ones and unfavorable situations into favorable ones, preventing small delays from becoming large ones and small accidents from becoming large ones due to unresolved issues, and preventing small impacts from becoming large impacts. This guarantees the production of the current shift and creates conditions for the next shift's production. It should be recognized that the production of an iron and steel complex is continuous and intricate, with numerous changes. We cannot yet fully and accurately grasp its laws all at once, and therefore cannot make completely correct and accurate operational plans and dispatch schedules in advance. Leading cadres being on duty during the first shift allows them to maintain control when certain expected changes occur and to strive for the initiative when unexpected changes occur. The facts listed in the communication "Starting from Zero O'Clock" published in this newspaper today vividly illustrate this point. If leading cadres only inquire about production after arriving at work at eight o'clock in the morning, a third of the day has already passed, and the outcome, good or bad, is already a fact. They would have to passively address the various problems left over from the first shift and passively revise plans. Matters that could have been resolved in minutes with little cost may now require hours or even greater expense, creating a passive and unfavorable situation for the entire day's production. Time is steel; losing the initiative is, in effect, losing steel!
    Being on duty during the first shift also represents a deeper determination on the part of leading cadres to go to the front lines of production. Since the first shift's production has problems, difficulties, and is a weak link, it is even more necessary for leading cadres to go to the first shift, share the hardships with the workers, work alongside them, and consult with them to overcome the weak link and transform low output into high output. We hope that the leading cadres of all enterprises can adhere to this system, strengthen the leadership of the first shift, take turns being on duty during the first shift, and turn it into a fixed system.
    "Morning" is usually understood as the time around sunrise, but for steelworkers who produce continuously in three shifts day and night, "morning" begins at midnight, zero o'clock, because they begin their day's production from zero o'clock. "The whole day's work depends on a good start in the morning." Since October 11th, Anshan Iron and Steel has improved and strengthened its night shift leadership, focusing on the first shift's production and giving each day's production a good start.
    On October 13th, we conducted an all-night interview and wrote down several fragments of Anshan Iron and Steel's night battle.
    In the "Headquarters"
    That day, it rained torrentially, and the temperature plummeted below zero. At eleven o'clock at night, we braved the cold rain and headed for Anshan Iron and Steel's production headquarters—the Great White Building. Usually, at this time, the Great White Building would have long been asleep, with only the lights of the production control room remaining. Tonight, the Great White Building in the rain and fog was brightly lit, with people coming and going, full of vitality. It turned out that the heads and section chiefs of the production department, technology department, mining department, transportation department... all those directly related to production, had begun their night shifts.
    At precisely one o'clock in the morning, the company held its first dispatch meeting (previously held only once a day at eight o'clock in the morning, now held three times a day, with another at one o'clock in the afternoon). The meeting was presided over by Comrade Fan Shulin, a member of the company's Party Committee Standing Committee and Secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission, who was the general duty officer for the night shift. The phone calls were clearer in the deep night, and the general duty officer listened very carefully to the work deployment for the first shift and the urgent problems to be solved in production.
    The report was over. As usual, those on night duty could go home to sleep, but now, the battle had just begun.
    A Tense Battle
    In the open-hearth furnace workshop of the First Steelmaking Plant, Secretary Fan was talking with the night shift labor union secretary.
    "How many heats of steel are you planning to produce this shift?"
    "Six heats."
    Secretary Fan said, "Good, it's time for the night shift to turn things around (in the past, the night shift only produced three or four heats of steel)."
    Secretary Fan looked at each furnace one by one and asked questions. The workers were encouraged to see the secretary coming to the front line in the middle of the night in the rain.
    Just as we were about to leave the open-hearth furnace workshop, the labor union secretary suddenly came to find Secretary Fan. He said that the train carrying steel materials from the north was unable to get through due to a blockage on the line. The plant's stock of steel materials was running low, which would affect production. Secretary Fan immediately made a phone call to the general dispatch room and the transportation department to organize personnel for emergency rescue. He then convened an emergency meeting in front of the furnace for the cadres on night duty in the First Steelmaking Plant.
    No one knew when the steel materials could be delivered. Could they just leave the furnaces empty and wait? No, after discussing it, someone said, "There are still a lot of steel materials scattered on the ground in the raw material yard. We should immediately clean up these remnants to meet the urgent need." Everyone said this was a good emergency solution. They acted immediately. The director of the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee on night duty immediately ran to the raw material yard to organize workers to collect steel materials. Before long, one trough after another of steel materials was placed in front of the furnace. A charging machine operator said, "If this had happened in the past, you couldn't find anyone by calling everywhere, and even if you could find someone, an hour or two would be wasted."
    We turned around to the ingot casting and raw material areas, and just as we were thinking about going to the location where the train accident occurred, the blocked train had already entered the steelmaking plant. "So fast!" we greeted. "How could it not be fast?" A person who jumped off the train, soaked to the bone by the rain, took over and said, "In the past, it would have to wait until sunrise. Now, so many leading cadres from the company, the transportation department, and the transportation office are working in the rain, of course, problems can be solved quickly."
    Steel is Tapped
    It was past three o'clock, and rain mixed with snowflakes was falling continuously. We rode our bicycles to the Second Steelmaking Plant, unexpectedly, Secretary Fan had already arrived before us, surrounded by a group of people. It turned out that the No. 13 open-hearth furnace here had already passed the tapping time, but it could not tap the steel because there were no ingot molds. People were very anxious. The general person in charge of the night shift at the plant had gone to the mold stripping yard to urge them to send the molds.
    Secretary Fan asked the ingot mold factory if they could rush to get the steel out. The other party said, "There is a set of ready-made molds, but they are prepared for the Third Steelmaking Plant. They also have a heat of steel that is about to be refined. If we give them to the Second Steelmaking Plant first, we are afraid that the Third Steelmaking Plant will have objections." Secretary Fan thought about it and also ran to the mold stripping yard.
    The labor union secretary and the shift leader led a group of workers, dividing their forces to watch and maintain the furnace, and all the preparations for tapping the steel were in order. Before long, people suddenly shouted in surprise: "The molds are here! The molds are here!" At this time, the No. 13 furnace slowly tilted, and a lightning-like red light split through the air. The red light reddened the workers' faces and warmed our hearts. The cold we brought on the road had long since disappeared.
    As soon as this heat of steel was tapped, gongs and drums were played, and the whole plant immediately became lively. The charging machines rotated in pairs, and the hundred-ton cranes moved forward side by side. Those who blew the furnace top and those who patched the furnace walls were all in high spirits. A dispatcher with a smile on his face said to me that yesterday, their first shift fired a cannon, producing seven heats of steel. This had never happened before. According to him, in the past, everyone desperately grabbed "twenty-four o'clock," only caring about the day's output, and did not create conditions for the night shift. As soon as the night shift took over, the previous shift would either leave a batch of "big-tailed steel" (all squeezed to tap the steel before zero o'clock, the conditions were not met, and the tapping time was prolonged), or many furnaces would not have molten iron added, and the site was not clean. A large pile of tricky problems was left over in the raw materials and equipment. The workers said: "The head shift is a broken mess. You don't get a share of the charge, you lead in cleaning up the battlefield." After cleaning up this mess, it was almost time to get off work. If something happened to the night shift, it was not easy to find someone, and problems that could have been solved in time were pushed to the next shift. When the first shift's production didn't go up, the second shift wasn't in a hurry, and the third shift had to rush desperately, resulting in a lot of difficulties for the second night shift. In this way, the night shift became the low-production shift among the four shifts.
    I asked him: "How is the night shift production today?" He said: "Six heats of steel is no problem. The molds were delayed, otherwise, we could have produced one more heat of steel. However, if Secretary Fan hadn't made a decisive decision here, it would have been difficult to say."
    Wherever There is Trouble, Go There
    It was already past five o'clock, and the rain had stopped imperceptibly. The east was already lighting up, but it was still foggy outside. On the way back, I passed the ironmaking plant, and the lights upstairs were still brightly lit. The person on duty for the night shift was Deputy Director Zhan. I wanted to talk to him, but he said he had gone to the No. 9 blast furnace. I ran to the No. 9 blast furnace, and then he said he had gone to the No. 10 blast furnace. I couldn't find him at the No. 10 blast furnace either.
    More than a dozen blast furnaces are scattered like stars, and it is four or five li long to walk around. It's really not easy to find someone. I flipped through their night shift records. Secretary Zhang of the Party Committee, Director Fan, Secretary Shi, and Furnace Chief Wang, the main leading cadres, up and down, were all on the night shift.
    Back at the Great White Building, the day shift workers came to work one after another, and everyone was busy making handovers. The second shift, a new battle, then began...

    从零点开始
    从零点一直抓到二十四点
    ——“冶金报”社论摘要
    冶金报记者
    大跃进中我们很重要的一条领导经验是，开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧。体现在每一天的生产领导上，这个“始”就是零点，这个“终”就是二十四点，要从零点就抓紧，一直抓到二十四点，以炉产量保班产量，以班产量保日产量，以日产量保月产量。凡是这样做的，生产没有不好的。但是也有一些企业不是这样，在他们那里，第一班的产量最低，第二班的产量稍高，第三班的产量最高，这一班的产量往往等于前两班产量之总和。为什么同样是八小时，产量会相差这么多？这除了是由于第一班天黑，操作不如白天方便，给生产带来了一定的困难以外，最重要的原因是领导力量比较薄弱，抓得不紧，否则就不可能解释为什么第三班也有一大部分时间是在黑夜生产，而却能高产。
    抓紧第一班的生产，实质上就是争取生产上的主动，力避被动。能够及早地安排全天三个班的生产任务，力争在第一班与第二班多完成一些，以便在第三班能够腾出时间为第二天的生产作好准备工作；而一旦发生事故，又能及早处理，化大为小，化不利为有利，不致于因为问题无人解决而使小耽误变成大耽误，小事故变成大事故，小影响变成大影响，既保证了当班的生产，又为下一班的生产创造了条件。应该认识到钢铁联合企业的生产是连续性的，是错综复杂、变化多端的，我们还不可能一下子就全部正确无误地掌握住它的规律，因而也不可能在事先作出完全正确无误的作业计划与调度计划。领导干部在第一班值班，正是为了在发生某些意料之中的变化情况时，可以稳操主动权，在发生某些意料不到的变化情况时，也能力争主动。今天本报发表的通讯“从零点开始”一文中所列举的事实，就生动地说明了这个问题。如果不是这样，领导干部到早上八点上班才过问生产情况，一天已经过去了三分之一，是好是坏已成事实，就不得不被动地来解决第一班所遗留下来的各种问题，被动地修改计划，本来几分钟、花很少代价就可以办好的事情，现在也许要花上个把小时，几个小时，甚至于更大的代价才能解决，给全天的生产造成被动的、不利的局面。而时间就是钢，丧失了主动，实际上就是丧失了钢铁！
    在第一班值班，对于领导干部来讲，也是一个下更大决心深入生产第一线的问题。既然第一班生产有问题，有困难，是薄弱环节，才更需要领导干部深入到第一班，与广大职工群众共甘苦，同劳动，同商量，共同来克服薄弱环节，把低产变成高产。我们希望各企业的领导干部能坚持这个制度，加强第一班的领导，轮流在第一班值班，并把它变成制度，固定下来。
    “早晨”，人们通常理解为日出前后这一段时间，但对昼夜三班连续生产的钢铁工人来说，从子夜的零点起，就是“早晨”了，因为他们从零点起，就开始了一天的生产。“一日之计在于晨”，鞍钢从10月11日起改进与加强了夜班领导，狠抓第一班生产，使每一天的生产，有了一个良好的开端。
    10月13日，我们做了一次通宵采访，写下鞍钢夜战的几个片段。
    在“大本营”里
    这一天，夜雨滂沱，气温激降到零度以下。夜十一点钟，我们冒着冷雨奔向鞍钢的生产大本营——大白楼。往常，在这个时候，大白楼早已沉沉入睡，只剩下生产总调度室的灯火；今晚，雨雾中的大白楼，灯火辉煌，人来人往，生气勃勃。原来是生产处、技术处、矿山处、运输处……凡是与生产直接有关的处长、科长和主要的管理人员，都开始上夜班了。
    凌晨一点整，公司召开第一次调度会议（过去只在每天早上八时开一次，现在每天召开三次，另一次在午后一时）。主持会议的是今天夜班总值班人、公司党委常委、监委书记范树林同志。深夜里的电话更清晰，总值班人十分注意地听取今天第一班的工作部署和生产中急待解决的问题。
    汇报结束了。照往常，值夜班的可以回家睡觉了，但现在，刚刚是战斗的开始。
    一场紧张的战斗
    在第一炼钢厂的平炉车间，范书记正和这里的夜班工委书记谈话。
    “你们这一班，计划出几炉钢？”
    “六炉。”
    范书记说：“好啊，夜班到了翻身的时候了
  （过去夜班只产三、四炉钢）。”
    范书记挨个炉子都看一看，问了问。工人们见书记深夜冒雨亲临前线，都受到了鼓舞。
    当我们正要离开平炉车间的时候，工委书记突然来找范书记。说是从北部开来的装钢铁料的火车，因线路堵塞开不过来，厂存的钢铁料已不多，就要影响生产。范书记马上挂电话，要总调度室、运输部门组织人员抢救，随后又召集第一炼钢厂值夜班的干部在炉前开了一个紧急会议。
    钢铁料甚么时候能送到，大家心里都没底，难道就这样空着炉子等着吗？不行，大家一商量，有人说：“原料场地下散落的钢铁料还有不少，应该马上清理这些底子应付急用。”大家都说这倒是个救急的办法。说干就干，值夜班的党委宣传部长立刻跑到原料场，组织工人搜集钢铁料，不一会儿，一槽槽的钢铁料就摆到了炉前。一个装料机手说：“这要是在过去，发生这样的事，到处挂电话也找不到人，就算找得到人，一两个小时也就白白过去了。”
    我们到铸锭、原料各处转了转，刚想到火车出事的地点去看看，没想到被堵住的那列料车已经开进了炼钢厂。“好快呀！”我们迎上去说。“怎能不快呢？”从车上跳下来一个浑身被雨浇透的人接过来说：“照往常，总得日出东方再说了。现在，公司的，运输部、运输处的，那么多领导干部都顶着雨干，解决问题当然就快了”。
    出钢了
    三点多钟了，雨里夹着雪花，下个不停。我们骑着车子跑到了第二炼钢厂，想不到范书记又赶在我们的前面了，一群人正围着他。原来这里的第十三号平炉早已过了出钢的时间，只是因为没有钢锭模不能出钢，人们很焦急。厂里的夜班总负责人已到脱模场催模子去了。
    范书记问了问钢锭模厂，能不能抢出这炉钢，对方说：“有一套现成的模子，不过是给第三炼钢厂预备的，他们有一炉钢也快要炼好，如果先给第二炼钢厂用，怕第三炼钢厂有意见。”范书记想了想，也奔向脱模场。
    工委书记、值班长领着一群工人，分兵把口，注视着、维护着这座炉子，出钢的准备工作一切就绪。不一会儿，忽听人们惊喜地喊道：“模子来了！模子来了！” 这时，只见十三号炉缓缓倾斜，一道闪电似的红光劈空而下。红光映红了工人们的脸，也暖热了我们的心。路上带来的寒冷早已消失。
    这一炉钢一出，锣鼓喧天，全厂立刻活跃起来。装料机双双旋转，百吨吊车并肩而行，吹炉顶的，贴炉墙的，人人精神抖擞。满脸笑容的调度员跟我说，昨天，他们第一班打了个响炮，出了七炉钢。这是过去从来没有过的。据他说，过去由于大家拼命抢“二十四点”，只顾当天产量，不给夜班创造条件，夜班一接班，前班不是留下一批“大尾巴钢”（都挤在零点以前出钢，条件不具备，拖长了出钢时间），就是好多炉子没兑铁水，现场也不清洁，原料、设备上遗留下一大堆缠手的问题，工人们都说：“大头班，破烂摊，冲锋陷阵没你的份，打扫战场你领先。”等收拾完这个残局，也就到下班的时候了。如果夜班再出点事，找人也不好找，本来可以及时解决的问题，也就推到下一班去了。第一班生产没上去，第二班也不着急，第三班又得拼命赶，结果又给第二个夜班带来很多困难。这样，夜班就成了四班中的低产班。
    我问他：“今天的夜班生产怎么样？”他说：“六炉钢没问题，模子耽误了一些，不然还能多产一炉钢。不过，若不是范书记在这里当机立断，那就很难说了。”
    哪里有事到哪里
    已经五点多钟了，雨在不知不觉中停了下来，东方已经发亮，但外面还是雾腾腾的。回来路过炼铁厂，楼上灯光仍然亮堂堂的，值夜班的是詹副厂长。我想找他谈谈，说是到九高炉了，我跑到九高炉，又说到十高炉了，在十高炉也没找到他。
    十几座高炉星罗棋布，走起来四、五里地长。找人真不容易。我翻了翻他们的夜班记录，党委张书记、范厂长、石支书、王炉长，上上下下值夜班的都是主要领导干部。
    回到大白楼，白班的职工陆陆续续地上班了，大家都在忙着办交代。第二班，一场新的战斗，紧接着又开始了。……
