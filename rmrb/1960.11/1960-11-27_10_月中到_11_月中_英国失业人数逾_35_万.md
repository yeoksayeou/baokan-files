At the same time, the British Ford Company, recently acquired by the American Ford Company, announced that approximately 18,000 workers belonging to Ford factories will have their working hours reduced starting next week. This means that the workers will have a bleaker Christmas. Consequently, some people who have signed installment purchase contracts will have to return their goods because they cannot continue to make payments.

    10月中到11月中
    英国失业人数逾35万
    新华社伦敦25日电　劳工部24日宣布，在到11月14日为止的一个月中，英国的失业人数增加了二万三千五百四十人，失业总数达到三十五万二千零四十三人。
    同时，刚被美国福特公司收买的英国福特公司的资方宣布，福特工厂所属的约一万八千名工人从下周起将缩短工时。这意味着工人们将过一个更加暗淡的圣诞节。因此有些签订分期购货合同的人，将因不能继续付款而不得不把货物交回去。
