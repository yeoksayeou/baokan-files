    Caihuaping Commune Persists in Unified Leadership, Tiered Management, and Adherence to Three-Level Ownership with the Production Team as the Foundation
    Team-Owned and Commune-Owned Economies Develop Simultaneously
    Overcome Natural Disasters for Two Consecutive Years, Increase Grain Production, Raise Income of Commune Members, and Gradually Bring Nine Poor Teams Up to the Level of Average Teams
    (Report from this newspaper) Since its establishment, Caihuaping People's Commune in You County, Hunan Province, has rapidly and comprehensively developed its economy by leveraging the unified leadership and the role of the commune-owned economy, adhering to the three-level ownership system with the team as the foundation, and vigorously supporting the development of the team-owned economy.
    For more than two years since the establishment of the Caihuaping Commune, while gradually developing the commune-owned economy, it has consistently focused on developing the brigade (i.e., the basic accounting unit of the commune, same below) economy. The vast majority of commune cadres have gone deep into the brigades to work, strengthening their leadership. In order to fully harness the enthusiasm and initiative of the brigades in developing production, the commune has delegated the main powers of production management to the brigades. Under the unified leadership of the commune, the brigades have the right to formulate production plans, organize production, and control distribution. Of the brigade's public accumulation fund, 30% is turned over to the commune, and 70% is retained by the brigade; brigades with less accumulation pay less than this proportion, and individual poor teams temporarily do not submit any public accumulation fund to the commune for several years.
    The commune actively supports production brigades in developing diversified operations. For industrial and sideline businesses that require large investments, generate little income in the short term, or are beyond the capacity of the brigade to operate, the commune manages them based on available conditions. For example, the production of plowshares, pots, and large-scale transportation tools are difficult for the brigades to produce, so the commune's farm implement factory manages them. The production of general small-scale farm implements is managed by the brigades themselves. This not only reduces the brigade's large investments but also generates more income and faster turnover.
    The commune-run economy provides multifaceted support for the brigades, especially the poor teams, to develop their economies. Specific methods include: First, providing strong assistance to address the key to increasing production in the brigades. Fifteen of the commune's twenty-two brigades have very poor water conservancy conditions, so the commune took the initiative to invest 100,000 yuan to purchase water pumps for use by these brigades. Over the past two years, the commune has organized cooperation based on the principle of equivalent exchange, building a number of small and medium-sized reservoirs to solve the water conservancy problems in severely drought-stricken areas. For example, Pingtang Brigade, after building the Hongmaochong Reservoir, irrigated most of its paddy fields, increasing production for two consecutive years and transforming from a grain-deficient team to a grain-surplus team. Second, grasping the weak links in the brigade's production development and providing multifaceted assistance. Commune-run enterprises adhere to the policy of serving agriculture and supporting the development of the brigade economy. For example, in the past, all teams generally lacked lime and often had to purchase it from Hengshan and other places. In order to support the brigades in breaking through this weak link, the commune invested 20,000 yuan to establish a lime factory, which has produced 360,000 dan of lime in the past two years, ensuring the needs of agriculture. In addition, the commune also helps solve the problem of insufficient means of production such as oxen and pig sources based on the different situations of each team. Third, making every effort to help brigades activate funds, the nine commune-run factories have taken out 120,000 yuan from their production surplus in the past two years to help brigades, especially poor teams, develop their economies.
    While vigorously developing the brigade economy, the Caihuaping Commune has also strengthened its commune-run economy. Last year, the commune-owned economy reached more than 300,000 yuan, and it is expected to be even higher this year. These economic sources, in addition to the 30% of public accumulation withdrawn from the brigade's public accumulation fund each year, mainly rely on commune enterprises to accumulate through production. In order not to hinder the development of the team-owned economy, they have adopted the policy of self-reliance in developing the commune-owned economy, engaging in businesses that require few laborers and avoiding those that require many. When it is necessary to mobilize labor, it is handled according to the principle of equivalent exchange, and consultations are held with the brigades to avoid affecting the brigade's need to develop production. The commune has established a total of seven production units, including a grass mat factory, a farm implement factory, a pig farm, and a forest farm, with annual income reaching 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, using only 1.35% of the total labor force. Second, they engage in businesses that are beneficial to the brigade's production, otherwise they do not, such as the commune's lime factory, farm implement factory, forest farm, and fish farm, which can provide means of production and seedlings, all serving the brigade's production. In establishing these businesses, they also pay special attention to minimizing the occupation of land, housing, and other means of production. For example, the fish pond of the commune's fish farm is a large wasteland that does not occupy a mu of farmland. The 500 pigs raised by the commune's pig farm are all developed through self-breeding, without transferring a single pig from the brigades. Therefore, the development of the commune-owned economy in this commune not only does not affect the development of the brigade economy but also strongly supports the development of the team-owned economy, especially the poor team economy.
    The result of Caihuaping People's Commune's adherence to the three-level ownership system with the brigade as the foundation for more than two years is that the entire commune economy has achieved comprehensive upswing. Although it suffered a severe drought for more than 120 days in 1959, the total grain output of the entire commune still increased by 11% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958; this year, it suffered even more severe natural disasters, but after efforts to fight the disaster, the total grain output is still comparable to last year. The income of commune members has increased, and the production and living standards of the original nine poor teams are also gradually catching up with the average brigades.

    菜花坪公社坚持统一领导分级管理坚持三级所有队为基础
    队有经济和社有经济同时发展
    连续两年战胜自然灾害，粮食增产，社员收入增加，九个穷队逐渐赶上一般队
    本报讯　湖南攸县菜花坪人民公社建社以来，由于发挥了公社统一领导和社有经济的作用，坚持执行以队为基础的三级所有制，大力扶助队有经济的发展，使整个公社经济获得迅速全面发展。
    菜花坪公社办社两年多来，在逐步发展社有经济的同时，一直把工作重点放在发展大队（即公社的基本核算单位，下同）经济上。公社绝大多数干部都深入到大队工作，加强对大队的领导。为了充分发挥大队发展生产的积极性和主动性，公社将生产经营管理的主要权力划归大队，在公社统一领导下，大队有权制订生产计划、组织生产、掌握分配。大队公积金除上缴公社30％外，70％归大队所有；积累少的大队还少于这个比例，个别穷队几年之内暂时不向公社提交公积金。
    公社积极支持生产大队发展多种经营。凡投资大、目前收入少或者大队经营不起的工业、副业，由公社根据可能条件进行经营，譬如犁头、制锅、大型运输工具等，大队难于生产，便由公社农具厂经营。一般小型农具的生产则由大队自己经营。这样不仅使大队减少大笔投资，而且收入多、周转快。
    社办经济多方支持大队特别是穷队发展经济。具体作法有以下几点：第一，针对大队增产关键，给予大力援助。全社二十二个大队中有十五个大队水利条件很差，公社主动投资十万元购买抽水机，供这些大队使用。两年多来，公社根据需要，按等价交换原则组织协作，兴建了一批中小型水库，使严重干旱地区解决了水利问题。洴塘大队就因为修了一座红毛冲水库，稻田大部得到灌溉，连续两年增产，已由缺粮队变成余粮队。第二，抓住大队发展生产上的薄弱环节，多方扶助。社办企业坚持为农业服务的方针，支持大队发展经济。譬如过去各队普遍缺乏石灰，往往要到衡山等地购买，公社为了支持大队突破这一薄弱环节，投资两万元兴办了一个石灰厂，两年来烧了三十六万担石灰，保证了农业需要。此外，公社还针对各队不同的情况，帮助解决耕牛、猪源等生产资料不足的问题。第三，千方百计帮助大队活跃资金，社办九个工厂，两年来从生产盈余中拿出十二万元，帮助大队特别是穷队发展经济。
    菜花坪公社在大力发展大队经济的同时，社办经济力量也壮大了。去年社有经济达到了三十多万元，今年预计可能更高一些。这些经济的来源，除每年从大队公积金提存30％的公共积累外，主要依靠公社企业进行生产积累。为了不妨碍队有经济的发展，他们在发展社有经济时，采取了自力更生的方针，凡用工少的就办，用工多的就不办。必须调用劳力时，按等价交换原则处理，并且同大队商量，不影响大队发展生产的需要。全社共办了草席厂、农具厂、养猪场、林场等七个生产单位，年收入达四十至五十万元，所用劳力仅占总劳力的1.35％。其次，凡有利于大队生产的就办，否则不办，如公社石灰厂、农具厂、林场、养鱼场等，能提供生产资料和种苗，都是为大队生产服务的。在兴办这些业务时，也特别注意尽量少占土地、房屋和其他生产资料。像公社鱼场的养鱼池，就是一块大荒地，没有占用一亩田地。公社养猪场养的五百头猪，全部是自养自繁发展起来的，没有从大队调一头猪。因此，这个公社发展社有经济，不仅不影响大队经济发展，而且有力地支持了队有经济，特别是穷队经济的发展。
    菜花坪人民公社两年多来坚持以大队为基础的三级所有制的结果，使整个公社经济获得全面高涨。1959年虽然遭受了一百二十多天严重旱灾，全社粮食总产量仍然比大跃进的1958年增长11％；今年又遭受了更加严重的自然灾害，经过努力抗灾，粮食总产量仍可相当于去年。公社社员收入增加，原来的九个穷队的生产生活水平，也在逐渐赶上一般大队。
