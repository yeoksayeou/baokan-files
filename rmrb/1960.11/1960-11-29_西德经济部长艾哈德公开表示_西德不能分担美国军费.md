West German Economics Minister Erhard Publicly States: West Germany Cannot Share U.S. Military Expenses

    (Reported by this newspaper) West German Economics Minister Erhard said on the 25th that West Germany is not prepared to financially bear the expenses of U.S. troops stationed in West Germany.

    According to an Associated Press report, Erhard made this statement at a press conference. He stated that "although West Germany is extremely concerned about maintaining the stability of the dollar's position," it cannot share the maintenance costs of the U.S. troops stationed in West Germany.

    The day before, Erhard also said at a West German employers' meeting held in Bad Godesberg near Bonn that he did not want countries with payment imbalances to suddenly change to adopting protectionist policies, but advocated "formulating an effective market policy at the international level."

    This is considered an implication by the West German government, requesting that the United States not adopt trade barrier policies in order to stop the international balance of payments deficit crisis and retaliate against Western Europe.

    西德经济部长艾哈德公开表示  西德不能分担美国军费
    本报讯　西德经济部长艾哈德25日说，西德不准备在财政上担负美国驻军的费用。
    据美联社报道，艾哈德是在记者招待会上这样说的。他表示，“虽然西德对保持美元地位的稳定是极其关切的”，但不能分担美国驻在西德的军队的维持费。
    在这前一天，艾哈德还在波恩附近巴特格德斯堡举行的一次西德雇主会议上说，他不希望支付不平衡的国家会突然改变到采取保护主义者的政策，而主张“在国际一级上制定一项有效的市场政策”。
    这被认为是西德政府的一种暗示，要求美国不要为了制止国际支付逆差危机和对西欧实行报复而采取贸易壁垒的政策。
