Big Mounds of Earth, Big Mounds of Grass, Big Mounds of Manure
Chengxiang Commune Launches "Three Big Mounds" Manure Accumulation Campaign
Yaotou Commune Implements Responsibility System to Ensure Early Implementation of Fertilizer Needed for Spring Planting

(Our newspaper's Jinan dispatch of the 27th) After the basic completion of the autumn harvest work, the Chengxiang People's Commune in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, immediately organized more than 10,000 people to carry out the work of accumulating and creating fertilizer with "three big mounds" of grass, earth, and manure.

The "three big mounds" movement of this commune was launched on the basis of thoroughly implementing the central government's instructions on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. In order to strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production next year, the commune party committee, in the spirit of starting early to gain the initiative, held a meeting of commune and team cadres and carefully studied the "three big mounds"—a family heirloom for increasing agricultural production. The so-called "three big mounds" are: mounds of grass, mounds of earth, and mounds of manure. With mounds of grass, winter heating can be guaranteed, and burning them turns them into good dry ash fertilizer; with mounds of earth, high-quality and large quantities of pen manure can be accumulated; with mounds of manure, grain production can be guaranteed. The commune party committee believes that vigorously developing the "three big mounds" is the way to run the commune diligently and thriftily, and the key to increasing grain production. The commune members said it well: "Without 'three big mounds' in front of the door, it's just bragging to say you'll grow good crops." The call of the commune party committee was warmly supported by the masses. The members of the Lijiaguang Production Brigade summarized the benefits of vigorously developing the "three big mounds" in the two winters of the year before last and last year. This team, located in the hills, accumulated high-quality and large quantities of pen manure by vigorously developing the "three big mounds" in the winter of 1958, which reduced the supply of commercial fertilizer the following year and lowered production costs. Production costs accounted for only 16% of the total annual income, while the portion distributed to the commune members accounted for more than 80% of the total income. Last winter, this team also insisted on carrying out the activity of "three big mounds," and this year, more than 1,200 mu of grain fields were fertilized with more than 5,000 jin per mu, and the yield per mu increased again. In contrast, the members of the Dongzhaotuan Production Brigade deeply summarized the lessons learned from not grasping the "three big mounds" activity in the past two years. Last year, due to the lack of sufficient soil fertilizer, more than 19,000 jin of various chemical fertilizers were applied, which increased production costs and reduced the income of commune members. The results of the final distribution after the autumn harvest showed that production costs accounted for 33.9% of the total income. There was a similar situation last year. The commune members reflected: "We suffered losses by not developing 'three big mounds' for two years." Through top-down discussions and bottom-up planning throughout the commune, the commune required this winter: every team, every household, every pen (livestock pen), and every field (pig farm) must store enough soil for bedding pens this winter and next year; teams and households should have enough grass for cooking and firewood for heating; and every team and household should have "three big mounds."

After the "three big mounds" activity began, the production teams of this commune further publicized and implemented the policies. All production teams have checked and publicized the fertilizer investments owed to commune members in the past, household by household, and cashed them in batches and phases, and paid them off in full by the end of the year. Regarding the specific policies related to picking up grass, cutting firewood, and moving mud to accumulate fertilizer, the production teams, after consulting with the commune members, formulated four measures: First, the mountain pastureland owned collectively by the production team will be uniformly organized by the production team and contracted to the production teams in designated areas for harvesting. The harvested firewood and grass will be divided between the commune members and the production team according to a certain ratio. All firewood and grass belonging to the production team will be handed over to the canteen as fuel; second, in their spare time, commune members can pick up grass and manure on their own, and whoever picks it up gets it; third, purchase manure from commune members' homes and price it according to quality; fourth, move soil by taking two approaches: one is to organize labor collectively by the team to transport it, and the other is to give reasonable remuneration to the soil moved by commune members on the premise of not affecting collective production.

Because the party committees at all levels of this commune strengthened specific leadership, the "three big mounds" activity was carried out in a solid and effective manner.

(Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 27th) The Yaotou People's Commune Party Committee in Wan'an County, Jiangxi Province, actively publicized and implemented the party's relevant principles and policies in the winter manure accumulation, which mobilized the enthusiasm of the commune members for manure accumulation and set off a manure accumulation upsurge. Their practices are: through summarizing the experience of increasing production, publicizing the correctness of the practices of simultaneously using organic and inorganic fertilizers, combining regular manure accumulation with concentrated manure accumulation, and using farm manure as the main component and chemical fertilizer as a supplement to solve the fertilizer problem, and publicizing the role of vigorously grasping fertilizer in vigorously developing grain, so as to improve the understanding of cadres and commune members on the significance of vigorously grasping fertilizer. At the same time, in the autumn harvest distribution, production teams that achieved excess production due to actively increasing fertilizer application, and those that saved fertilizer investment and ensured the completion of the contracted production plan by relying on large-scale accumulation of household manure and natural fertilizer, were given rewards according to the "three guarantees and one reward" policy. Reasonable remuneration was given to household manure accumulated by commune members, and model manure accumulators were rewarded.

In the current manure accumulation movement, the Yaotou Commune has also universally implemented the responsibility system, contracted large areas of green manure crops, and implemented the fertilizer needed for spring planting next year to the contracted units as early as possible, and the enthusiasm of the production teams for manure accumulation has been universally improved. More than 20 experienced old farmers from each team of the Yaotou Production Brigade have been braving the rain to go to the fields to drain the green manure fields in order to manage more than 20,000 mu of green manure crops, ensuring that the fields are dry after the rain, so that the green manure seedlings are strong and complete. The Pingtou and other production teams put forward the slogan of "Digging pond mud to add more and better fertilizer to green manure." Eighteen teams dried up more than 20 ponds and dug more than 8,000 dan of pond mud in one day.

Due to the implementation of the policy of pricing household manure accumulated by commune members according to quality and paying remuneration, it has also played a certain role in encouraging commune members to increase household manure accumulation. Commune members of the Pingtou Production Team recently built more than 60 new toilets; some commune members also diligently bedded pig pens to increase fertilizer sources. (Attached picture)

    土堆大　草堆大　粪堆就大
    城厢公社开展“三大堆”积肥运动
    窑头公社实行责任制春播需肥及早落实
    本报济南27日电　山东莱阳县城厢人民公社在三秋工作基本结束之后，立即组织了一万多人，开展了草、土、粪“三大堆”积肥造肥工作。
    这个公社的“三大堆”运动，是在深入贯彻中央大办农业、大办粮食指示的基础上开展起来的。为了争取明年农业生产大丰收，公社党委本着早动手争主动的精神，召开了社、队干部会议，对历来农业增产的传家宝——“三大堆”作了细致研究。所谓“三大堆”即：草堆，土堆，粪堆。有了草堆就能保证冬季取暖，燃烧后又变成了干灰良肥；有了土堆就能够积下质高量多的圈肥；有了粪堆就能够保证粮食增产。公社党委认为：大搞“三大堆”，是勤俭办社之道，增产粮食的关键。社员们说得好：“门前没有‘三大堆’，种好庄稼是胡吹。”公社党委的号召，受到群众的热烈拥护。李家广生产大队的社员，总结了前年和去年两个冬季大搞“三大堆”的好处。这个队，地处山丘，由于1958年冬季大搞“三大堆”积下了质高量多的圈粪，第二年减少了商品肥料的供应，降低了生产成本，生产费用只占全年总收入的16％，而社员分配部分则占总收入的80％以上；去冬这个队又坚持了搞“三大堆”的活动，今年一千二百多亩粮田，每亩上粪五千多斤，亩产量又有增加。与此相反，东赵疃生产大队的社员，深刻地总结了二年来没有抓紧“三大堆”活动的教训。去年，由于没有积下足够的土肥，施用了各种化学肥料一万九千多斤，提高了生产成本，减少了社员的收入。秋后决分的结果，生产费用竟占总收入的33.9％。去年也有类似情况。社员们反映说：“二年没搞‘三大堆’，咱们吃了亏。”全社通过自上而下的讨论，自下而上的作出了计划，全社今年冬季要求：队队、户户和栏栏（畜栏）、场场（猪场）都要储足今冬和明年垫圈用土；队和各户备足食用烧草和取暖柴草；作到队队、户户都有“三大堆”。
    “三大堆”的活动开始之后，这个社的各生产队又进一步宣传和贯彻了政策。各个生产队都把以往欠社员的肥料投资，逐户查清张榜公布，并分批分期兑现，年底全部还清。对拾草砍柴、搬泥积肥的有关具体政策，各生产队与社员商量以后定出四项办法：第一、对归生产队集体所有的山岚草场，由生产队统一组织劳力，按生产小队划片包干进行收获，收获的柴草社员和生产队按比例分成；属生产队的全部交食堂作为燃料；第二、工余时间，由社员自行拾草、拣粪，谁拾归谁；第三、收购社员家肥，按质论价；第四、搬土采取两条腿走路的办法，一是由小队组织劳力集体搬运，二是在不影响集体生产的原则下，社员搬的土小队给予合理报酬。
    这个社由于各级党委加强了具体领导，大搞“三大堆”活动进行得扎扎实实。
    据新华社南昌27日电　江西省万安县窑头人民公社党委在冬季积肥中积极宣传和贯彻党的有关方针政策，调动了社员的积肥积极性，掀起了积肥热潮。他们的做法是：通过总结增产经验，宣传实行有机肥料和无机肥料同时并举、经常积肥和突击积肥相结合、农家肥料为主化学肥料为辅等解决肥料问题的做法的正确性，宣传大抓肥料对于大办粮食的作用，提高干部和社员对大抓肥料意义的认识。同时在秋收分配中对因为积极增施肥料获得超产，和依靠大积家肥、自然肥而节约了肥料投资，又保证完成包产计划的生产小队，都按“三包一奖”政策给予奖励。对社员积的家肥都给予合理报酬，并对积肥模范人物给予奖励。
    在当前积肥运动中，窑头公社又普遍推行了责任制，对大面积绿肥作物实行了包产，并把明年春播需要的肥料及早落实到包产单位，各生产小队积肥的积极性普遍提高。窑头生产队各小队二十多名管理绿肥有经验的老农，为了管好两万多亩绿肥作物，最近冒雨下田，为绿肥田开沟排水，保证了雨过田干，使丘丘绿肥苗旺苗全。坪头等生产队提出了“大挖塘泥，为绿肥多追肥追好肥”的口号，十八个小队一天就车干了二十多口水塘，挖了八千多担塘泥。
    由于贯彻了对社员个人积肥按质论价、付给报酬的政策，对鼓励社员增积家肥也起了一定的作用。坪头生产队的社员最近新建了六十多个厕所；有的社员还勤垫猪圈，以增加肥源。（附图片）
