    "Eulogy to Poison Literature"
    Tian Ma　Poetry, Fang Cheng　Drawing
    Reported: A kind of "literature" praising drugs has appeared in the United States, regarding drugs as a "source of inspiration."

    Where do "writers" seek inspiration?
    Heroin, opium, and heroin!
    An inexhaustible source,
    "Works" emerge from drugs!
    Fantastic and "clever,"
    The boss is overjoyed at first sight:
    Just worried about having no clever plan to fool the people,
    Sending treasure is better than gold!
    Coming in clouds and going in fog,
    He's relieved if people enjoy it.
    Massive sale of drug "works,"
    A double dose of poison, a deep effort!
    Who is "civilized" under the heavens?
    America is the champion!
    Drugs, drug addicts, and poison gas,
    Hard to part with!

    “颂毒文学”
    天马　诗  方成　画
    报载：在美国出现了一种颂扬毒品的“文学”，把毒品看作是“灵感的源泉”。
    “作家”灵感何处寻？
    白面、鸦片、海洛因！
    源源不绝取不尽，
    毒品之中出“作品”！
    异想天开好“聪明”，
    老板一见喜盈盈：
    正愁愚民无妙计，
    送来宝贝胜黄金！
    云里来呀雾里去，
    人若乐此他放心。
    毒品“作品”大拍卖，
    双毒齐下功夫深！
    普天之下谁“文明”？
    要数美国是冠军！
    毒品毒虫和毒气，
    跟它难舍又难分！
