Short Commentary

    The excellent situation of the entire Party and all the people engaging in agriculture and grain production inspires thousands of rural cadres and commune members. As can be seen from the news items published in today's newspaper, people are taking advantage of this excellent situation, striving for the initiative, and making early preparations for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year. Look! Some places are selecting and retaining excellent seeds for next year; some are expanding the planting of green manure for increased early rice production; some are using the favorable conditions of autumn to transform low-yielding fields... The prelude to the great battle to win even greater victories in agricultural production next year has been gradually unveiled in various places!
    Taking this step and considering the next; grasping the present with one hand and the coming year with the other; preparing early and striving for the initiative. On the agricultural front, people are increasingly consciously learning and applying Chairman Mao's strategic thinking. In the struggle with nature, they are increasingly deeply grasping the laws of agricultural production, better utilizing various favorable factors, overcoming various unfavorable factors, and creating conditions for winning greater victories.
    What exactly should be grasped early, and how should it be grasped? This requires earnestly summarizing this year's and past years' agricultural production experience, analyzing the situation of next year's leap forward, and determining appropriate countermeasures based on objective conditions and subjective requirements. For example, Jiangxi Province, based on local conditions, decided to further expand the planting area of early rice next year. To plant more early rice, more fertilizer is needed. Therefore, they immediately took action and mobilized farmers throughout the province to plant green manure on a large scale. The Hekou Commune in Shimen County, Hunan, conducted a comprehensive analysis of the commune's production situation this year and found that the main reason for the small increase in production was that low-yielding fields were holding them back. They are determined to transform the commune's more than 2,000 mu of low-yielding fields this autumn to lay a favorable foundation for a significant increase in production next year.
    Agricultural production particularly requires early action and early preparation. First, it has a strong seasonality. There are certain favorable opportunities for when to cultivate and when to plant. By taking action early and preparing all kinds of work well, when the opportunity comes, a quick battle can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Second, agricultural production is fighting against nature. With earlier preparation, there is more room for maneuver. When encountering unexpected changes in natural conditions, one can deal with them calmly without being at a loss.
    We must fully utilize the current excellent situation to lay a favorable foundation for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year.

    步步争先
    全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的大好形势鼓舞着千千万万农村干部和公社社员。从本报今天刊登的几条新闻可以看出，人们正利用这个大好形势，力争主动，为明年农业生产继续跃进早作准备。你看！有的地方在选留明年用的优良种籽；有的为早稻增产扩种绿肥；有的利用秋季的优越条件，改造低产田……。夺取明年农业生产更大胜利的伟大战斗的序幕，在各地陆续揭开了！
    走着这一步，考虑下一步；一手抓当前，一手抓来年；及早准备，争取主动。在农业战线上，人们越来越自觉地学习和运用毛主席的战略思想。在同大自然的斗争中，越来越深入地掌握农业生产的规律，更好地发挥各种有利因素，克服各种不利因素，为夺取更大的胜利创造条件。
    早抓，到底抓什么？怎样抓？这就要认真总结今年和往年的农业生产经验，分析明年跃进的形势，根据客观的条件和主观的要求，确定适当的对策。例如，江西省根据当地的情况，决定明年进一步扩大早稻种植面积。多种早稻，就要多备肥料。他们于是立即动手，发动全省农民大种绿肥。湖南石门县河口公社，对全社今年的生产情况作了全面的摸底分析，发现增产幅度不大的主要原因是低产田拖住了后腿。他们下决心在今年秋季把全社的二千多亩低产田改造好，为明年的大幅度增产打下有利基础。
    农业生产特别需要早动手，早准备。首先，因为它有强烈的季节性。什么时候该耕，什么时候该种，都有一定的有利时机。及早动手，把各种准备工作做好了，时机一到，速战速决，可收事半功倍之效。其次，农业生产是跟大自然作战，准备早些，回旋余地也就大些，遇到意料不到的自然情况的变化，就可以从容应付，而不致手足无措。
    我们要充分利用当前的大好形势，为明年农业生产继续跃进打下有利的基础。
