Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 21st - The Party Committee of Jiangxi Fengcheng Steel Plant consults with the masses on everything and follows the mass line, which has enabled the plant's pig iron production and average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces to double since the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee held an on-site conference to promote this plant's experience in launching mass movements to steel enterprises throughout the province.

The plant's leading cadres have repeatedly experienced that whenever a new difficulty cannot be solved, as long as it is handed over to the masses and truly discussed with the masses, many ingenious solutions can be found. Once, the entire plant was short of two days' worth of ore raw materials, and the mine's production could not keep up for a while. After the Party Committee handed over this practical difficulty to the masses, the worker in charge of raw materials proposed an unexpected solution. It turned out that during the long-term process of ore loading and unloading, many small pieces of good ore had rolled down beside the railway base, stretching for two *li*, which had been covered by soil over time and no one had noticed. The Party Committee immediately organized manpower for a concentrated effort and dug up more than 530 tons of good ore, meeting the urgent needs of the blast furnace. As production rose steadily, the problem of insufficient raw material and fuel transportation capacity in the entire plant became increasingly prominent. According to the original situation, it would be necessary to add 900 laborers, 20 automobiles, and 70 large flatbed carts to adapt. The Party Committee told the workers in the transportation workshop about this situation and inspired them to come up with solutions. At this time, Chen Jinshui, the leader of the transportation team, suggested changing the system of working one shift throughout the day to three shifts of day and night transportation, with people taking turns and machines not stopping. The result of the implementation was that not only was there no need to increase manpower and vehicles, but the average working time of the workers was also shortened, and the daily transportation volume increased from 150 tons to 250 tons.

The plant's leading cadres often go deep into the most difficult and challenging places in production, see with their own eyes, do it themselves, consult with the masses, and mobilize the masses to smoothly solve key problems. In September, the flatbed cart transportation workers implemented a three-shift day and night transportation system, greatly improving transportation capacity. However, the night shift workers were very tired, and the work efficiency was not as high as the day shift, so everyone was a little anxious. At this time, Du Jiahui, the deputy director of the plant in charge of transportation, personally participated in the night shift transportation and found that there was a long section of road that was narrow, uneven, winding, and dark, making it very slow to push the cart at night, taking each step cautiously. He consulted with the workers to solve this problem. The workers were very moved after hearing this. The next day, more than 40 workers, led by Du Jiahui, spent half a day leveling the road and installing seven electric lights at the bends. The work efficiency of the night shift transportation workers quickly doubled that day. The more enthusiastic the masses were, the more concerned the Party Committee became about the workers. In the process of implementing the technical operation policy of high wind, high temperature, and refined materials in each blast furnace, many furnace workers, in order to avoid changes in furnace conditions caused by pulling wind and blocking the taphole, often risked the fire to force full wind tapping, which was both unsafe and difficult to ensure the taphole was blocked. Zhu Chengcai, the deputy director of the plant who often operated with the workers in front of the furnace, then concentrated his efforts on breaking through the key to full wind tapping. After many experiments and innovations, he finally created a simple taphole blocking machine with the workers, which was both powerful and very safe to use.

The Party Committee organized a labor competition centered on blast furnaces and crisscrossing and closely cooperating throughout the plant. Leading cadres at all levels went to various types of work to grasp the most important and weakest points, and carried out political and ideological mobilization work. For example, as the output of blast furnaces rose steadily, coking became a weak link for a time. The deputy director of the plant in charge of coking went to the coking furnace in the coking workshop, talked about the situation, laid out the facts, and mobilized the workers to carry out a competition to produce more coke and better coke. Liu Fubao, a Communist Party member, based on the principle of Yingtan Iron and Steel Plant using low-quality coal to make good coke, creatively tried to build a "Fengcheng Coking Furnace" with ventilation and fire on all sides, with a coking rate of up to 76% and a coking time shortened from more than ten hours to one and a half hours. After the successful trial of the new type of coking furnace, the workers in the coking workshop immediately launched a competition to build "Fengcheng Coking Furnaces" on a large scale, and built 14 coking furnaces within a week. Thus, all the low-quality coal was used to replace the main coking coal, and the coke was supplied continuously, ensuring the needs of blast furnace production increase.

    丰城钢铁厂党委善于走群众路线
    江西省委向全省钢铁企业推广这个厂大搞群众运动的经验
    据新华社南昌21日电　江西丰城钢铁厂党委遇事和群众商量，走群众路线，使这个厂的生铁产量和高炉平均利用系数，从增产节约运动以来都提高了一倍。中共江西省委特召开现场会议，向全省钢铁企业推广这个厂大搞群众运动的经验。
    这个厂的领导干部多次体验到：每当一个新的困难解决不了的时候，只要把它交给群众，切切实实同群众商量，就会找到许多妙计良方。有一次，全厂缺两天矿石原料，矿山生产一时跟不上，党委把这个实际困难交给群众以后，管原料的工人提出了一条意想不到的办法。原来，在长期的矿石装卸过程中，有许多小块的好矿石滚落在铁路基两旁，足有两华里长，日子久了被泥土掩盖，没人注意它。党委马上组织人力突击，挖到了五百三十多吨好矿石，供应了高炉的急需。随着生产节节上升，全厂原料燃料运输力量不足的问题越来越突出，按照原来的状况，需要新增九百个劳动力、二十部汽车、七十部大板车才能适应。党委把这个情况告诉了运输车间的工人，并启发工人想办法。这时运输队小队长陈金水建议把白天一班运到底的制度改为三班日夜运输，人停车不停。实行结果，不仅人力、车辆不需要增加，而且工人的平均劳动时间还缩短了，日运量由一百五十吨增加到二百五十吨。
    这个厂的领导干部经常深入到生产中最艰苦、最困难的地方去，亲眼看，亲手干，与群众同商量，发动群众顺利地解决关键问题。9月间，大板车运输工人实行三班日夜运输，运力大大提高。但是，夜班工人很辛苦，工效又不如白班的高，大家都有些发急。这时候，管运输的副厂长杜家穗就亲自参加夜班运输，发现有一大段路面狭窄，高低不平，拐弯抹角，黑夜推车，一步一探，十分缓慢。他就和工人商量解决这个问题。工人听了十分感动。第二天，四十多名工人在杜家穗率领下，用半天时间就平整了路面，并在拐弯处安了七盏电灯。当天夜班运输工人的工效就迅速提高一倍。群众干劲越大，党委就越加关心工人。各高炉在贯彻执行大风、高温、精料的技术操作方针中，许多炉前工为了避免拉风堵口引起炉况变化不定，往往冒着炉火强行全风堵口，既不安全又难有把握堵住铁口。经常和工人一起在炉前操作的副厂长朱成材，这时便把精力集中到突破全风堵口这个关键上来。经过多次试验和革新，他终于和工人一起创造了一种简便的堵口机，用它来堵口，动力既大，又十分安全。
    党委在全厂职工中组织了一个以高炉为中心的纵横交错、密切配合的劳动竞赛。各级领导干部都分头深入到各工种中去，抓住最重要又最薄弱的一点，进行政治思想发动工作。例如，高炉产量节节上升，炼焦一度成为薄弱环节，管焦化的副厂长就到焦化车间炼焦炉边，讲形势，摆情况，发动工人开展多炼焦、炼好焦的竞赛。共产党员刘福保根据应潭钢铁厂用低质煤炼成好焦的原理，创造性地试建了一座四面八方通风进火的“丰城炼焦炉”，结焦率高达76％，结焦时间由十多个小时缩短到一个半小时。新型焦炉试验成功以后，焦化车间的工人立即掀起大建“丰城炼焦炉”的竞赛，一周内就建起了十四座炼焦炉。从而做到了全部以低质煤代主焦煤，焦炭源源供应，保证了高炉增产的需要。
