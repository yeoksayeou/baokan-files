    “Overproduction Captain”
    ——Ru Xiaolin Leads Production Team to Years of Overproduction
    Wanrong County Central Communications Group, Ying Nan, Our Correspondent, Sha Yin
    In Sunji Commune, Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, in the Xili Management Area (that is, the production team, which is the basic accounting unit of the people's commune, same below), there is a Communist Party member named Ru Xiaolin. For four consecutive years, he served as the captain of three production teams, leading small teams of dozens of households to overproduce, and leading large teams of over a hundred households to also overproduce. He also led losing teams to overproduce; overproducing in good years, and still overproducing in disaster years. The reputation of "Overproduction Captain" has spread around.

    Turning Defeat into Victory in the First Year
    To know the origin of the Overproduction Captain, we must first talk about the Loss-Making Captain.

    In 1956, Ru Xiaolin was the captain of the Twelfth Production Team. Because he was often sick, the work of the production team relied on three deputy captains. Unexpectedly, after the autumn accounting, the contracted production plan was not completed, and they lost more than 1,700 yuan. Immediately, the team cadres and members were stunned and blamed each other. Three households said they would not stay in the Twelfth Team and transferred to other teams. Three of the four captains were discouraged.

    Ru Xiaolin was anxious and angry, unable to eat or sleep for several days, constantly muttering in his heart: What is the reason for this? But he couldn't figure it out. Just when he couldn't move forward or retreat, the Party Branch Secretary Ru Zuoyin came and said, "Xiaolin, this mood is not right! You have to look ahead. If you didn't do well this year, listen to the opinions of the members and think of ways." These words made Xiaolin suddenly understand. Xiaolin found the three deputy captains and discussed a major plan, determined to learn from failure, find lessons, and work hard next year.

    They held a meeting of the members to find the reasons for the losses. Some said it was because people were lazy, and others said it was because the land was poor. In short, they blamed the poor conditions. Xiaolin listened here and there, and the more he listened, the more he felt something was wrong. He said to everyone, "If you say the land is poor, the land is cultivated by people. Can't it be improved? If you say people are lazy, our team has the most poor and lower-middle peasants. Which one of them didn't grow up drinking bitter water? In my opinion, it's because the cadres didn't do a good job!" This opened the lid, and opinions flowed like a river bursting its banks. Some said that the problem lay in the unclear foundation: they were with the members all day long, but they didn't understand them; they were busy with production all day long, but they didn't know what problems there were in production. The cadres also "took off their pants and jumped into the water," thoroughly washing themselves in a "bath," and making a thorough examination of their leadership thinking and leadership methods.

    With the problems clarified, the solutions were found. Everyone agreed to strengthen the team's leadership, established a team committee, not only with the participation of the captains, but also absorbing several experienced old farmers as members. The team cadres also had a clear division of labor, with special personnel in charge of production and ideological work. In order to raise the awareness of the members, questions were often raised for everyone to discuss, such as: What is the iron rice bowl of farmers? The members shouted and their minds were clear. They all said: "People should join the commune with their hearts, and it is safest to eat by labor." Many people made plans for full attendance and completion of labor days throughout the year.

    At the beginning of the spring plowing in 1957, 86% of the labor force in the team went to the fields. This year, they invested more than 8,000 workdays into the land, and the work was done early, carefully, and well. At the end of the year, everything exceeded production, and the overproduction bonus alone was more than 1,900 yuan. The loss-making team was replaced with an overproduction sign. In the winter, the three households that had left the team saw that the Twelfth Team had turned itself around in a year, and they returned after much pleading.

    The Overproduction Sign Cannot Fall
    Production was good in 1957, and in 1958, with more experience and greater enthusiasm, they steadily achieved another big overproduction. The members were planning how to do the work in 1959, when the production team expanded again. At that time, the people's communes had just been established, and there was no experience in whether it was better for the production team to be large or small. The management area decided to try the large team first, combining the three teams into one, with Ru Xiaolin still as the captain.

    Leading a production team of over a hundred households, Ru Xiaolin also had no experience at the beginning, and could not grasp all aspects, and production fell into chaos. Of the team's 197 laborers, the team cadres didn't know who was attending work and who wasn't; regardless of how much or how little work was done, work points were recorded uniformly per day. When labor arrangements fell into disarray, the farm work couldn't keep up, and the planting was not very good. Faced with this situation, Ru Xiaolin came up with a solution in a timely manner. Years of experience told him that to do a good job, the fundamental principle was to listen to the Party and rely on the masses. So he accepted instructions from the Party branch on the one hand, and learned methods from the masses on the other. Finally, it was decided to implement group operations, dividing the labor force into three groups, and selecting male and female team leaders and deputy leaders, and then assigning the team cadres to take responsibility for the groups, going straight to the bottom. In terms of labor remuneration, the method of evaluating work and recording points was consistently implemented. As a result, labor attendance reached more than 90%. With more labor in the fields, Xiaolin seized the first stage of spring plowing and launched a major offensive: for the first time, the team eliminated sowing on uncultivated land. The first shot of spring plowing production was fired, and the morale of the members was boosted, and public opinion greatly changed. The old team members said: "Hey! With our Xiaolin, we are not afraid of which team joins us."

    Spring plowing production began, and Xiaolin insisted on working in the fields with the members every day. As time went on, new problems were discovered. In the first cotton cultivation, the first and second work groups completed the task in five days, and the work was done well; the third work group hoed for six and a half days, and the weeds were not completely removed. This matter tied a knot in Ru Xiaolin's heart: "Where is the problem?" He went to discuss it with Wang Chuangcai and other members of the third group, and they said: "Why doesn't the team committee stipulate the completion time for each type of farm work?" This hit the nail on the head, and Ru Xiaolin discussed it with the team cadres, adding a small piecework system to the group operation, stipulating the completion time, work quality, and remuneration for various farm tasks, and contracting them to the work groups. As a result, the team's various farm tasks progressed step by step. This year, wheat, autumn grain, and cotton all exceeded production, and the management area awarded them an overproduction bonus of 3,063 yuan.

    Hard Grass Knows Strong Wind
    After a year of testing the organizational scale of the production team, it was easier to lead when it was smaller, and the management area reduced the size of the large team, and Ru Xiaolin became the captain of the Eighth Team again. The foundation of the Eighth Team was the old Twelfth Team, which was truly strong and well-equipped.

    With the captain arranging well and the members in high spirits, in theory, overproduction should not be a problem. Unexpectedly, the weather was bad. From the time the autumn crops were planted last year to the wheat harvest, there was not a single heavy rain. Despite rushing and rushing, the summer harvest revealed that wheat production had still decreased. Some cadres and members were a little discouraged again, and they said: "The sign of the overproduction team will be blown away this year!" Ru Xiaolin also felt very uncomfortable, but he thought: Now we can't discourage the members. As long as everyone works hard, what is lost in the wheat field can be recovered in the autumn field. So he said to everyone: "As long as everyone is willing to work hard, there is no Flaming Mountain that cannot be crossed. We, the people's communes, must fight against the hateful heaven!" After the summer harvest, the team committee made a "make up for the losses" plan, and put forward a resounding slogan: "Find the sheep lost in the flock, and recover the grain lost in the grain field!" The team members worked hard and replanted a total of 350 mu of late autumn crops, which was one-third more than in previous years. As soon as the replanting was finished, the team held an "economic activity analysis meeting" to allow all the members to come up with ideas again. This method was indeed effective. The members chattered and came up with three ideas: planting small plots of land, intercropping and interplanting in autumn fields, and replanting autumn crops in cotton field gaps. Ru Xiaolin also came up with two ideas, one was to interplant corn in watermelon fields, and the other was to sow double rows of corn.

    "When three people are of one mind, yellow soil can be turned into gold." With everyone's understanding unified, everything was done smoothly. In a few days, 84 mu of autumn fields were intercropped; corn was interplanted in 8 mu of watermelon fields and 4 mu of hemp fields; the production team and the canteen opened more than 230 mu of small plots of land in ditches and slopes, planting grains and vegetables; corn was replanted in places where there were missing seedlings in the cotton fields; and turnips were replanted in places where the corn did not come up. Although these "odds and ends" were not eye-catching, when the autumn harvest was calculated, 28,240 jin of grain were harvested additionally. The summer harvest lost a total of only 2,064 jin, and this grain made up for the loss and left more than 26,000 jin. Because of the early start, the cotton was cultivated and moisture was conserved seven times in the severe drought, and it also exceeded production. When the autumn harvest distribution budget came down, they were again an overproduction team. This made the members very happy, saying: "Hard grass knows strong wind. With Xiaolin, our overproduction team is an iron flagpole that cannot be blown down, broken, or dried up!"

    Where is the Key?
    Ru Xiaolin has been in charge of three teams for four years, overproducing every year and in every team. The achievements are really not bad. When we asked him what his leadership experience was, he couldn't say what it was. Later, we had to find Ru Zuoyin, the secretary of the management area's Party branch. Zuoyin said: "Other people's experience as team leaders is three or five points, but Xiaolin's experience as a team leader is only one point: being familiar with people, familiar with heaven, and familiar with the land. This is simple to say, but difficult to do. Without following the mass line, you can't be familiar with people; without participating in labor, you can't be familiar with the land; without learning new scientific and technological knowledge, you can't be familiar with heaven. In a word, if you don't listen to the Party, you can't be familiar with anything."

    “超产队长”
    ——茹小林领导生产队连年超产
    万荣县中心通讯组　应南　本报记者　莎荫
    山西省万荣县孙吉公社的西里管理区（即生产队，是人民公社的基本核算单位。下同），有个共产党员叫茹小林。他一连四年当了三个生产队的队长，领导几十户的小队超了产，领导百十户的大队同样超产，接过来赔产队也超了产；丰年超产，灾年还是超产。“超产队长”的名声，也就在周围传开了。
    转败为胜第一年
    要知道超产队长的来历，先得从赔产队长说起。
    1956年，茹小林是第十二生产队的队长。他因为经常闹病，生产队的工作就靠给三个副队长。不想秋后决算一揭底，包产计划没有完成，还赔了一千七百多元。这一下，队干部和社员大瞪了眼，互相埋怨。有三户社员说什么也不在十二队，转了队。四个队长中有三个泄了气。
    茹小林又急又气，一连好几天吃不下饭，睡不着觉，心眼里老是嘀咕着：这倒底是因为啥？可是总也摸不出个头绪来。正在他前进不得，后退不行的时候，党支部书记茹作印来了，作印说：“小林，这情绪可是不对劲啊！眼得往前头看哩，今年没搞好，去听听社员的意见，想想办法。”话不说不明，这一说，小林一下悟过来了。小林就把三个副队长找到一起，共商大计，下决心从失败中学经验，找教训，来年大干。
    他们召开了社员会，寻找赔产原因。有人说是人懒，也有人说是地烂。总起来一句话：怪条件不好。小林这头听了那头听，越听越不对味，就向大家说：“要说地烂，地是人种的，难道就不能变好？要说人懒，咱队贫农、下中农最多，那一个不是喝苦水熬大的？叫我说，就是干部没当好！”这一下揭开了盖子，意见像决了堤的河水。有的说，毛病就出在底子不清上：整天和社员打交道，就不了解社员；整天闹生产，就不知道生产上有啥问题。干部们也就“脱裤子下水”，痛痛快快洗了个“澡”，从领导思想到领导方法作了彻底检查。
    问题摆明了，办法也就找出来了。大家都同意加强队的领导，成立了队委会，不光队长们参加，还吸收了几个有经验的老农当委员。队干部中也来了个明确分工，生产、思想工作都有了专人管。为了提高社员的觉悟，经常提出问题让大家讨论，如：啥是庄稼人的铁饭碗？社员们一嚷嚷心眼亮了，都说：“人入社心也要入社，靠劳动吃饭最保险。”许多人订出了全年出勤和完成劳动日的计划。
    1957年春耕一开始，全队86％的劳力下了地。这一年，他们给地里投了八千多个工，活儿做得又早、又细、又好，到年终样样超产，光超产奖励金就得了一千九百多元。赔产队从此换上了超产牌子。到冬天，离了队的三户社员见十二队一年翻了身，又说好说歹地回来了。
    超产牌子倒不了
    1957年生产搞得好，1958年经验也有了，干劲更大，又稳扎稳打地拿了个大超产。社员们正盘算1959年的活儿怎么干，生产队又扩大了。当时人民公社刚成立，究竟生产队大点好，小点好？都没有经验。管理区决定先搞大队试一试，就把三个队合成一个队，茹小林还当队长。
    领导一百几十户的生产队，茹小林开头也没有经验，各方面掌握不住，生产就乱了套。全队一百九十七个劳力，每天谁出勤谁没出勤，队干部心里没有数；活儿做多做少，一律按晌记工分。劳动安排一乱套，农活就赶不上趟，种的就不甚好。面对这种情况，茹小林就及时想办法。多年的经验告诉他，要把工作作好，根本的一条是：听党的话，依靠群众。于是他就一面从党支部接受指示，一面向群众学办法。最后决定实行小组作业，把劳力分成三个小组，又选了男女正副组长，然后让队干部分组包干，一竿子插到底。在劳动计酬方面，坚持实行了评工记分的办法。这么一来，劳力出勤达到了90％以上。地里的劳力多了，小林就抓住春耕生产第一关，发动了一个大攻势：全队头一次消灭了白茬下种。春耕生产头一炮打响了，社员们的劲也鼓了起来，舆论大变。老队员说：“嘿！有咱小林，合进来那个队也不怕。”
    春耕生产开始了，小林坚持和社员天天一起下田劳动。日子一久，又发现了新问题。第一次棉花中耕，第一、二两个作业组五天完成了任务，活儿做得挺好；第三作业组，锄了六天半，草还没锄净。这事儿在茹小林的心上挽起一个大疙瘩：“船在那里湾着呢？”他去找三组社员王创才他们商量，他们说：“队委会为啥不规定每样农活的完工时间？”这一锤子敲亮了心，茹小林就和队干部们商量，在小组作业上加了个小段包工，把各种农活的完工时间、工作质量、工作报酬规定出来，包给作业小组。结果全队各项农活步步赶前。这一年小麦、秋粮、棉花都超产，管理区奖给了他们超产金三千零六十三元。
    疾风知劲草
    生产队的组织规模，经过一年试验，还是小一些便于领导，管理区就把大队划小，茹小林又当了第八队队长。第八队的底班是老十二队，真是兵强马壮。
    队长会安排，社员的情绪高，按理说，超产没问题。不想，天时不好，从去年种上秋禾，到麦收还没见一场透雨。紧赶慢赶，夏收一澄底，小麦还是减了产。有的干部和社员就又有些泄气了，他们说：“超产队的牌子今年算吹了！”茹小林心里也挺不好受，可是他想：现在可不能泄社员的气，只要大家加劲干，麦地里丢了的，秋地还能找回来。于是就给大家说：“只要大家肯干，就没有过不去的火焰山。就凭咱人民公社也得斗一斗可恶的老天！”夏收以后，队委会作了个“补窟窿”的计划，提了个响亮的口号：“羊群里丢了羊群里找，粮田里丢了粮田里捞！”全队社员一鼓劲干，一共复播了三百五十亩晚秋作物，面积要比往年多三分之一。复播刚收了耧，队里又接着开了个“经济活动分析会”，让全队社员再出主意。这办法果然灵验，社员们七嘴八舌一嚷嚷，就嚷出了三条计：种小块地，在秋田套种、间作，在棉田空隙补种秋禾。茹小林也出了两个主意，一个是西瓜地套种玉茭，一个是播种双行玉茭。
    “三人一条心，黄土变成金。”大家认识一致了，干起啥来也挺俐落。没几天，就把八十四亩秋田进行了间作；八亩西瓜地、四亩大麻地里套种上了玉茭；生产队、食堂又在沟沟坡坡里开了二百三十来亩小块地，种了粮食和蔬菜；棉花地里缺苗的地方，补种了玉茭；玉茭没上来的地方，又补种了蔓菁。别看这些“零零碎碎”不打眼，秋收下来一算账，就多收了二万八千二百四十斤粮食。夏收满共才亏产二千零六十四斤，这粮食补起亏产，还余下两万六千多斤。棉花因为下手早，在大旱头，光中耕保墒就过了七道手，也超了产。秋收分配预算下来，他们又是个超产队。这一下，把社员们高兴坏了，说：“疾风知劲草，有了小林这个人，咱这超产队是铁旗杆，吹不倒，打不烂，旱不死！”
    关键何在？
    茹小林四年经了三个队，年年超产，队队超产，成绩实在不赖。我们问他的领导经验是什么，他怎么也说不出个名堂来。后来只好找到管理区党支部书记茹作印，作印这么说：“别人当队长的经验有三条、五条，小林当队长就只有一条：对人熟、对天熟、对地熟。这说来简单，做起来不易。不走群众路线，人熟不了；不参加劳动，地熟不了；不学新的科学技术知识，天熟不了。归根一句话，要不听党的话，就什么也熟不了。”
