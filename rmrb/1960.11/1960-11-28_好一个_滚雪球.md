    What a Great "Snowball Effect"!
    In winter, after a heavy snow, the earth is covered in white. It's loose when you step on it, and light when you hold it in your hand. But rolling a snowball is different – the more you roll it, the bigger it gets, and the more solid it becomes.
    The Zhouqiaozi Production Brigade's Party branch adopted a "snowball" method, with Party members leading activists, and activists leading the masses. One leads one, one strings along another, one connects to another, with countless threads, connecting more and more. The branch's role, through these invisible lines, is like the radiation of the sun, shining everywhere, shining into everyone's heart.
    Using the "snowball" method to cultivate activists has the advantage that: with the branch as the core, with Party members as the backbone, from near to far, from few to many, attracting the masses to a central point – implementing the Party's policies. Originally one person used their brain, now many people use their brains; originally one person took action, now many people take action; originally one person did the work, now many people do it, how can the work not be done well? How can things not be accomplished?
    The masses' comment on this "snowball" method: "With the Party branch's strong leadership, with our '108 heroes,' and with the whole village commune members' single-mindedness, even if Ping Mountain Fortress (a mountain south of the village) collapses, we can prop it up." This comment gets right to the heart of the matter: as long as we adopt the snowball method, expand the ranks of activists, unite the broad masses, from cadres to commune members, from Party members to the masses, everyone is of one mind, united as one, inseparable. In this way, if we carry out political and ideological work thoroughly, deeply, and meticulously, everything can be done well.

### 好一个“滚雪球”

    好一个“滚雪球”
    冬天，一场大雪之后，大地上白茫茫一片。脚踩在上面稀松，托在手上轻飘飘。滚雪球就不一样，越滚越大，越滚越结实。
    周桥子生产队党支部采用“滚雪球”的方法，党员带积极分子，积极分子带群众。一个带一个，一个串一个，一个连一个，千丝万缕，越连越多。支部的作用，通过这些无形的线，就像太阳的辐射一样，照遍四方，照到每个人的心上。
    采用“滚雪球”的方法来培养积极分子，好处在于：以支部为核心，以党员为骨干，由近及远，由少到多，把群众吸引到一个中心点上——贯彻党的政策。本来一个人动脑筋，现在许多人动脑筋；本来一个人动手，现在许多人动手；本来一个人做工作，现在许多人做，何愁工作做不好？何愁事情办不成？
    对这种“滚雪球”的办法，群众的评语：“有支部的坚强领导，有我们这‘一百单八将’，有全村社员的一条心，平山堡（这村南面的一座山）倒了，我们也能把它扶起来。”这个评语正说到了节骨眼上：只要采取滚雪球的方法，扩大积极分子队伍，团结广大群众，从干部到社员，从党员到群众，大家一个心，抱成一个团，分也分不开。这样，把政治思想工作做透、做深、做细，一切事情都能办好。
