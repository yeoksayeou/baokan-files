Wuhan Boiler Factory Transfers Excellent Cadres to the Cafeteria

(Our dispatch) The Party Secretary of the Wuhan Boiler Factory personally went into the kitchen and carried out political and ideological work in the cafeteria, greatly improving the cafeteria's work.

After Song Xiaonan, the Deputy Party Secretary of the factory's Party Committee, went into the kitchen, he conducted education among the cooks and workers about the glory of all labor. At the same time, he resolutely transferred fourteen excellent cadres and workers from various workshops and offices to work in the cafeteria, significantly changing the political and ideological state of the cafeteria staff. After Huang Wencai, a Communist Party member and demobilized soldier, and Zhang Lizhen, a Communist Youth League member and second-grade fitter, came to work in the cafeteria, they were full of enthusiasm and worked hard, which greatly moved everyone. Chef Cheng Shelin used to want to learn technology in the workshop. Seeing that the skilled workers were very happy to work in the cafeteria, he felt that he should do a better job and became more active in his work.

To run the cafeteria well, the first thing is to improve the food so that the workers are satisfied. At that time, some workers complained that the amount of food was small. Secretary Song weighed the food once while selling it and found that the quantity was low. So he found the cooks and relevant people to study together, asking how much rice could be cooked from one jin of rice? Some people said it could make three and a half jin of rice, and some said it could make at least three jin and four liang. This question awakened everyone, and they all said that no one had calculated this account in the past. After finding the problem, the Party Committee instructed the Democratic Management Committee of the cafeteria to specifically help the cafeteria experiment with how much rice could be produced from one jin of rice, and how much water should be added to different types of rice. After repeated experiments, the cafeteria staff knew exactly how to cook and serve rice, ensuring that the quantity was sufficient.

The factory is large and there are many people. Several thousand people eat each meal, and queuing is a big problem. In the past, the cafeteria managers thought that this problem could not be solved, and that to solve it, the large cafeteria would have to be divided into small cafeterias. The Party Committee mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and ideas. After discussion and research from top to bottom, the three types of tickets for grain, oil, and money were combined into one ticket. Workers could buy a meal with just this one ticket, and there was no need to give change, greatly reducing the time for buying meals, which was welcomed by all the workers in the factory.

### 武汉锅炉厂抽调优秀干部下食堂

    武汉锅炉厂抽调优秀干部下食堂
    本报讯　武汉锅炉厂党委书记亲自下厨房，把政治思想工作作到食堂去，使食堂工作大大改善。
    这个工厂的党委副书记宋笑南下厨房以后，一面在炊事员和职工中进行一切劳动都光荣的教育，一面坚决从各车间科室抽调了十四名优秀干部和工人到食堂去工作，使食堂工作人员的政治思想状况发生显著变化。共产党员、转业军人黄文才、共青团员、二级钳工张立针到食堂工作后，情绪饱满，埋头苦干，使大家很受感动。炒菜师傅程社林过去想到车间学技术，看到技术工人到食堂工作都非常愉快，觉得自己更应该好好干，工作也积极起来。
    要把食堂办好，首先是把饭菜搞好，使职工吃了满意。当时有职工反映饭的数量少。宋书记有次在卖饭时称了一下，发现数量偏低，于是他就找做饭的师傅及有关的人一起研究，问一斤米究竟能做多少饭？有人说能做三斤半饭，有人说至少能做三斤四两。这一问大家清醒了，都说过去谁也没有算这个账。找出问题以后，党委责成食堂民主管理委员会具体帮助食堂试验一斤米出多少饭，什么样的米应该下多少水。经过反复试验，食堂工作人员对于做饭打饭做到心中有数，数量给足。
    厂大人多，一餐几千人吃饭，排队是个大问题。过去，食堂管理人员认为这个问题无法解决，要解决就得把大食堂分为小食堂。党委发动群众献策献计，经过上下研究讨论，把粮、油、钱三种票合为一种票，职工只凭这一种票就能买到一份饭菜，而且不需要找零，大大压缩了买饭的时间，受到了全厂职工的欢迎。
