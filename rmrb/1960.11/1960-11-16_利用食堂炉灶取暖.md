    Using Canteen Stoves for Heating
    The Qianjin People's Commune in Heping District, Shenyang City, recently successfully developed a kind of fire wall that does not require burning coal. The structure of this fire wall is the same as a general fire wall, except that there is no stove opening. It uses the smoke and fire from the canteen's stove chamber to generate heat. The smoke and fire are first led into the fire wall and then discharged from the chimney. This way, the fire wall is heated.
    Using this kind of fire wall for heating can not only save coal and heating equipment such as stoves, but also makes the indoor temperature even, hygienic, and the insulation time is also long.

    利用食堂炉灶取暖
    沈阳市和平区前进人民公社最近研究成功一种不用烧火的火墙。这种火墙的构造和一般火墙相同，只是没有炉口。它利用食堂炉膛里的烟火来发热。烟火先被引到火墙里，然后再从烟囱排出去。这样，火墙就烧热了。
    用这种火墙取暖，不但可以节省煤炭和火炉等取暖设备，而且室内温度均匀、卫生，保温时间也长。
