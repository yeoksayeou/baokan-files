In Our Commune

    The Gao Sheng Production Brigade of the Tie Men Commune in Xin’an County, Henan Province, faces a shortage of vegetables every spring. This year, Meng Zhongwen, the Party Branch Secretary of the brigade, in order to completely solve this problem and ensure that the members have vegetables to eat year-round, visited experienced old farmers and the West Yao Production Team, which had grown winter vegetables relatively well last year. He learned that as long as winter-sown vegetables safely survive the winter cold, they can mature early and increase production. Based on this experience, Meng Zhongwen first interplanted spinach in twenty mu of garlic fields, interplanted Chinese cabbage in forty mu of Chinese cabbage fields, and interplanted rapeseed and spinach in wheat fields in the canteen vegetable garden of the West Yao Team. Then, he organized all the brigade cadres and some members to visit and discuss the methods. The cadres and members all agreed with this method. All seven hundred and ninety-five mu of vegetable fields of the fourteen canteens in the team were quickly planted with winter vegetables, and the teams also interplanted vegetables in more than seven hundred and eighty mu of wheat fields. In order to ensure that the winter vegetables safely overwinter, the brigade organized a winter vegetable production management technical team and decided to apply “compacting fertilizer” universally to the vegetable seedlings with horse manure before the severe cold to enclose the small seedlings and promote the development and strengthening of the roots. By the "Beginning of Spring" next year, the vegetable seedlings will grow vigorously and mature in thirty days.

    春菜冬种早熟增产
    河南新安县铁门公社高省生产大队，每年春天都缺菜吃。今年，大队党支部书记孟忠文为了彻底解决这个问题，保证社员常年有菜吃，他走访了有种菜经验的老农和去年种植冬菜比较好的西瑶生产队，了解到只要使冬播蔬菜安全度过冬寒关，就能早熟和增产。孟忠文根据这个经验，自己先在西瑶小队食堂的菜地里的二十亩蒜地上套种上菠菜，四十亩白菜地里套种上大青菜和在麦地里套种上油菜、菠菜等，然后组织全大队干部和部分社员边参观边讨论。干部和社员都同意这个办法。全队十四个食堂的七百九十五亩菜地很快地全部种上了冬季蔬菜，各小队也在七百八十多亩麦地里套种上了蔬菜。为了保证冬菜安全越冬，大队组织了冬菜生产管理技术小组，决定在严寒以前用马粪普遍给菜苗施一次“压封肥”，封闭小苗，促使根部发育壮大，到明年“立春”，菜苗就能旺盛地生长，有三十天的时间菜就成熟了。
