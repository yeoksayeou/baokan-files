    Communication Between Higher and Lower Levels
    Geng Qiao

    Combining leadership with the masses and ensuring communication between higher and lower levels is our Party's consistent approach, and we have many good methods in this regard. Now, a large number of cadres are going deep into the front lines of production, not only living, eating, working, and consulting with the broad masses, but also communicating the Party's policies downwards and the masses' opinions upwards. This is a new and good method. This means that cadres must not only "four together" (同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量 - eat, live, work and consult together) but also "one communicate" (一通).

    This word "communicate" (通) is very important. We must communicate the Party's policies downwards. Now, we want to vigorously develop agriculture, better leverage the superiority of the people's communes, and further develop productive forces so that agriculture truly plays its role as the foundation of the national economy. To achieve this, we must better implement policies. Comrade Mao Zedong once said, "Policy is the starting point of all actual actions of a revolutionary party, and it manifests itself in the process and outcome of the actions. Any action of a revolutionary party is the implementation of policy." All the actions of cadres who go deep into the front lines of production, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, are to implement the Party's policies. They must pay attention to communicating policies to production teams and to the masses, explaining policies item by item, clause by clause, sentence by sentence, in their original form, without any discount, and tightly linking each step without any slackening. Policies must be truly communicated downwards, all the way to the bottom, not just partially, but completely. Once policies are rooted in the hearts of the masses, their enthusiasm will be added to their hands. If one only focuses on technical matters in production and pays little or no attention to policies, the result will be that policies are not implemented, leaving blank spots. Is it necessary to care about production technology, even a specific detail? Absolutely. However, we cannot be satisfied with just that. We must see that policy is a central link; once this link moves, it will drive the entire chain.

   “One branch moves, a hundred branches sway.” Our Party's policies are in line with the fundamental interests of the masses. When policies are communicated downwards, they will be welcomed by the masses, mobilizing the enthusiasm of every production team, every household, and even every individual. When the enthusiasm of the masses is mobilized, everything in production becomes easier to handle. A commune's Party secretary said, "Our work is like a train moving forward, and the Party's policies are like the tracks it runs on. Following the tracks, we can travel a thousand miles a day; leaving the tracks, we cannot move an inch." Therefore, the focus of work should first be on grasping policy, communicating it to the masses, and making it meet with the masses. Cadres handing over policies to the masses also makes it easier for the masses to supervise their conscientious and unreserved implementation of policies. Cadres eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses is to better play a cadre's role, that is, to do a good job and implement policies. Implementing the "four together" is intended for "one communicate," that is, to communicate policies to the masses.

    Is communicating the Party's policies downwards enough? No, we must also communicate the opinions of the masses upwards. What problems did they encounter in production teams while implementing policies? Reflecting the real situation there to the higher-level leading organs, making it clear and complete rather than vague, can serve as a basis for enriching and developing the Party's policies. How to obtain these reflections? We must rely on truly communicating the Party's policies to the bottom, to the masses, consulting with the masses seriously, carefully conducting class analysis, and truly getting to the essence of the problems. Otherwise, we can only scratch the surface, fail to reflect depth, or provide an incorrect reflection. Therefore, communicating downwards and communicating upwards are mutually influential. Only by communicating downwards well can we communicate upwards well. And communicating upwards prepares new conditions for better communication downwards. The more accurate and profound the situation is reflected, the more it will help the leading organs make new decisions and lead the masses to continue moving forward. In the process of communicating downwards and upwards, cadres will also be tempered and improve more quickly. In communicating downwards, cadres must strive to master policies and learn to control policies. In communicating upwards, cadres must learn to conduct investigations and research and develop analytical habits. Through such training, cadres will mature faster and their leadership abilities will be stronger.

    Both communicating upwards and communicating downwards, ensuring communication between higher and lower levels. When communication is established between higher and lower levels in one place, it will inevitably promote communication before and after, left and right, and in all directions. Every production team and every commune member can understand the Party's policies. Every task and every corner can be permeated with the spirit of the Party's policies. When everyone has a clear direction, higher morale, greater enthusiasm, and more methods, then a combat team of thousands of well-aligned troops will be formed, and there will definitely be hope to build the rural people's communes more perfectly.

    上下相通
    耿桥
    把领导与群众结合起来，上下相通。我们党一向是如此的，在这个方面有许多好办法。现在，大批干部深入生产第一线，除了同广大群众一起，同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量以外，还把党的政策通下去，把群众的意见通上来。这就是一个新的好办法。这就是干部既要“四同”，还要“一通”。
    这个“通”字很重要，必须把党的政策通下去。现在，我们要大办农业，更好地发挥人民公社的优越性，进一步发展生产力，使农业真正发挥其为国民经济基础的作用，这就必须更好地执行政策。毛泽东同志曾说，“政策是革命政党一切实际行动的出发点，并且表现于行动的过程和归宿。一个革命政党的任何行动都是实行政策。”深入生产第一线的干部的一切行动，也正如毛泽东同志指出的，是为了实行党的政策的，他们必须注意把政策通到生产小队，通到群众中去，逐项、逐条、逐句讲解政策，源源本本，不折不扣，环环套紧，一环不松。把政策真正通下去，通到底，不能半通不通，一定要全通。政策一落到群众心里，干劲就添到群众手上。如果只埋头生产技术上的事，不过问或少过问政策，结果政策不落实，留下空白点。关心生产技术，甚至于某一个细节，要不要呢？完全需要。但是，不能只满足于这个。要看到，政策是一个中心环节，这个环节动了，就会把全部的链条带动起来。
  “一枝动，百枝摇。”我们党的政策是符合群众的根本利益的。政策通了下去，就会为群众所欢迎，把每一个生产小队，每一个家庭，以至每一个人的积极性调动起来。群众积极性调动起来，生产中的一切事务，就都好办了。一个公社的党委书记说，“我们的工作，好比前进的列车，党的政策，好比运行的轨道。按轨道走，一日千里；离开轨道，寸步难行。”所以，工作的重点，应当首先是抓政策，把政策通到群众中去，使它与群众见面。干部把政策交给群众，也就更便于让群众来监督自身认真地、不折不扣地执行政策，干部与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，是为了更好地去发挥一个干部的作用，也就是说，要做好工作，要执行政策。实行“四同”，意在“一通”，就是把政策通到群众中去。
    把党的政策通下去，是不是就完了呢？不，还要把群众的意见通上来。他们在生产小队里，执行政策中碰到了什么问题？把那里的真实情况反映给上级领导机关，使它灿然毕陈，而不是若明若暗，就可以作为丰富和发展党的政策的依据。如何得到这些反映？又必须依靠把党的政策真正通到底、通到群众中去，同群众认真商量，仔细作了阶级分析，真正接触到问题的本质，不然，也只能浮光掠影，反映不出深度，或者提供一片不正确的折光。所以，通下去和通上来，是互相起作用的。只有很好地通下去，才能很好地通上来。而通上来又为更好地通下去准备了新的条件。情况愈是反映得正确和深刻，就愈有助于领导机关作出新的决定，领导群众继续前进。干部在通下去和通上来的过程中，也将得到锻炼，更快的提高。通下去，干部要努力精通政策，学会掌握政策；通上来，干部要学会调查研究，养成分析习惯。经过这样的锻炼，干部的成熟就会更快，领导能力就会更强。
    既通上，又通下，上下相通。一处上下相通，必然促进前后左右、四面八方相通。每一个生产小队，每一个社员，都能了解党的政策。每一项工作，每一个角落，都能贯穿党的政策精神。人人方向明确，情绪更高，干劲更足，办法更多，那就形成了千万支步伐整齐的战斗队，就一定有希望把农村人民公社建设得更加美满。
