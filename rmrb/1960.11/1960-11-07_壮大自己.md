　　Strengthen Ourselves

　　The needs of agricultural production are multifaceted: it requires not only relatively large modern agricultural machines such as tractors and irrigation and drainage power equipment, but also various semi-mechanized, small and medium-sized improved farm implements and processing machines. A large part of the manufacturing tasks for these machines must be undertaken by local county and commune industries.

　　If county and commune industries are to undertake this glorious task and contribute more and greater efforts to supporting agricultural technological transformation, they must constantly strengthen their own strength. Vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, through reforming existing machinery and equipment and building various indigenous machines to replace manual operations. Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, relying on its own efforts to manufacture more than 100,000 pieces of improved tools, is a very good example.

　　In the process of county and commune industries strengthening their technical strength and equipment strength, it is necessary to strive for the support of urban industry; it is also an unshirkable obligation of urban industrial departments in various places to make every effort to give strong support to counties and communes in terms of equipment and technical strength.

    壮大自己
    农业生产的需要是多方面的：既需要拖拉机、排灌动力设备等比较大型的现代农业机具，更需要各种半机械化的、中小型的各种改良农具和加工机具。这些机具的制造任务有很大部分要靠各地县社工业承担起来。
    县社工业要承担起这个光荣任务，为支援农业技术改造贡献更多更大的力量，就必须不断地壮大本身的力量。大搞技术革新和技术革命，通过改革原有的机器设备和大造各种土机器代替手工操作。江苏无锡县依靠自己的努力制造十万多件改良工具，就是很好的例证。
    县社工业在壮大技术力量和设备力量中，争取城市工业的支援，是必要的；尽一切努力从设备、技术力量上给县社以大力的支援，这也是各地城市工业部门义不容辞的义务。
