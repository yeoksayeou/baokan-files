    Shangjia Village Brigade Transforms Severe Disaster into Light Disaster
    The entire team’s production reduction is reduced from 60% to 20%, and winter production and disaster relief work has been fully arranged

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Shangjia Village Brigade of Liangtai Commune in Anqiu County, Shandong Province, suffered the worst flood in decades this year. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the masses were fully mobilized and worked hard for more than two months, reducing the production reduction of the entire team from 60% to 20%.
    Resolutely Fight
    The Difficulties
    In mid-August, the Shangjia Production Brigade suffered a severe rainstorm, which flooded most of the crops, resulting in a loss of more than 60% of production. After the disaster, the morale of some cadres and members was once very low. They said: Anyway, the higher authorities will not let people starve to death, so we'll just take things as they come.

    "We must not be intimidated by the disaster, but resolutely lead the masses to fight against the difficulties!" The commune party committee held an emergency meeting and promptly pointed out the direction of mobilizing the masses for production and disaster relief. Zhang Qifu, the secretary of the general party branch of the brigade, carefully pondered a few sentences in the resolution of the commune party committee: The key to fighting the disaster is to break the negative and fearful emotions and fully mobilize the masses; the main way to overcome the negative and fearful emotions is to find out the disaster situation, find countermeasures, and establish the idea that man can conquer nature.... The more he thought about it, the clearer he became, and the more he felt that there were solutions.

    At the enlarged meeting of the general party branch of the brigade, Zhang Qifu first led everyone to specifically analyze the disaster situation and the favorable conditions for overcoming the disaster. One of the reasons why some cadres had fearful emotions was that they were frightened by the temporary flood. After a comprehensive analysis of the situation, a ranking of each piece of land and each crop, everyone gradually found ways to fight the disaster: First, the early autumn crops were basically ripe and could be harvested quickly; second, the late autumn crops could be managed and processed to reduce losses; third, on some land where crops were completely destroyed, vegetables could be replanted to increase harvests. The conclusion of the meeting was that we should advance in the face of difficulties and never be intimidated by them.

    Then, a meeting of commune members was held to improve the masses' confidence in fighting the disaster by explaining the disaster situation, the favorable conditions, and the methods to overcome the difficulties. Li Congde, a seventy-year-old commune member, recalled the flood situation in 1914 (the third year of the Republic of China) and said: "If you haven't tasted the bitterness of the past, you won't know the sweetness of the present; there was a big flood in the third year of the Republic of China, not to mention eating wild vegetables and tree bark, even the grass on the eaves was eaten. Even so, the old government still wanted food and money, regardless of the life and death of the masses. That year, more than 90 households in our village fled the famine, and more than a dozen people starved to death. Now that we have suffered a flood, the Party and the government have not only sent food and money, but also sent cadres to visit and help with drainage; brother communes and teams have also come to help. If it were not for the new society, who knows how many people would have starved to death in this flood?" Before he finished speaking, the meeting place became active: "Yes! In the new society, with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the people's communes, if everyone works together, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome." Everyone spoke one after another, some expressing their determination, some suggesting solutions. The commune members put forward more than a dozen disaster relief methods.

    After the meeting, more than 1,000 laborers in the whole team immediately plunged into the struggle of production and disaster relief.
        Implement the Policies to Promote Disaster Relief
    When the masses are mobilized, difficulties are easily solved. Things that were originally thought to be impossible are now possible. For example, in order to save the soybeans that were silted up by mud and water, Communist Youth League member Xu Benlan led the commune members to wash the soybean leaves one by one. The actions of this team influenced the entire team, and after seven or eight days of hard work, they washed the mud from each of the 300 mu of soybeans with heavier silt. At the same time, the 320 mu of early autumn land in the whole team was basically harvested; the more than 1,400 mu of sweet potato land that had been flooded was mostly ridged, the vines were turned over, and fertilizer was applied; the 700 mu of soybeans that were lightly flooded were also generally picked once; and more than 200 mu of autumn vegetables were replanted. The late autumn crops that had been rescued began to grow again.

    At this time, as the autumn harvest distribution approached, a new concern arose among some commune members about whether to continue to implement the "three guarantees and one reward" policy after the disaster. The general party branch discovered this problem and solved it in a timely manner. It was clearly announced that the "three guarantees and one reward" system would be resolutely implemented, and the method was to revise the "three guarantees" indicators according to the disaster situation. In order to solve this problem in a practical and realistic manner, the general party branch organized cadres from each team and veteran commune members to go deep into the fields to check the disaster situation of various crops and study the revision methods. The production team cadres and commune members were generally satisfied. The first team had 20 mu of sweet potatoes that were severely affected by the disaster. They originally did not want to manage and process them. After revising the "three guarantees" indicators, they immediately organized 17 laborers to ridge them once and apply fertilizer once.
    Take Back What Was Lost
    "We must take back the losses caused by the disaster" this battle cry has become a unanimous action of the broad masses of commune members. After rescuing the late autumn crops, the next step was the autumn harvest, autumn plowing and autumn sowing. Under the conditions of the disaster, it was a very arduous task to ensure that enough wheat was planted well and on time. However, people knew that this was a fundamental measure to overcome the disaster, and it had to be completed. Everyone worked together, and the entire team's wheat sowing plan was completed three days before the Cold Dew, exceeding the quota by 200 mu, and the quality also exceeded that of previous years. The autumn harvest was even more refined. The commune members were determined to harvest everything that could be harvested. At present, 70% of the sweet potato land in the entire team has been re-harvested three times, and more than 40,000 jin of sweet potatoes have been re-harvested. In addition, more than 160,000 jin of sweet potato vines, leaves, and cabbage heads have been harvested.

    Strive for a Summer
    Harvest Next Year
    Now, when you walk into the Shangjia Village Brigade, it is a completely different scene. Every day at dawn, groups of commune members carry furniture and hum tunes, heading to the fields and gardens, each full of energy. In the fields, the wheat seedlings, which stretched as far as the eye could see, were green and had left the ground. The piles of dried melon, piles of seedlings and piles of bean stalks in the yards were all arranged so neatly and magnificently. The autumn harvest of the entire team has been finalized. According to the production verification, after more than two months of struggle, the disaster situation has been greatly reduced. The entire team's production reduction has been reduced from 60% to 20%. Four of the five teams have overfulfilled the revised production target.

    The great achievements in production and disaster relief have further established the confidence of the commune members in completely overcoming the disaster. At present, the entire team has arranged winter production and disaster relief work, and decided to strengthen the management of wheat fields and overwintering vegetables with 200 laborers, and carry out manure accumulation and fertilizer production with 110 laborers, and strive to exceed the summer harvest next year; at the same time, it will also carry out nine kinds of sideline production with 200 laborers to increase income; and properly arrange the lives of commune members and do a good job in combining work and rest.

    分析困难　找出办法　发动群众　生产救灾
    尚家庄大队重灾变轻灾
    全队由减产六成降为二成，冬季生产救灾工作已全面安排
    本报讯　山东安丘县凉台公社尚家庄大队，今年遭受了几十年来未有的水灾。在党组织的领导下，充分发动群众，艰苦奋斗两个多月，使全队由减产六成降为减产两成。
    坚决向
    困难斗争
    尚家庄生产大队在8月中旬，由于大雨成灾，淹没了大部分庄稼，造成减产约60％以上的损失。受灾后，部分干部和社员的情绪一度十分消沉。他们说：反正上级不能叫饿死人，到哪山砍哪山的柴。
      “决不能为灾荒吓倒，要坚决领导群众，向困难作斗争！”公社党委召开紧急会议，及时指出了发动群众生产救灾的方向。大队党总支书记张启福同志细细琢磨了公社党委决议中的几句话：当前抗灾的关键是打破消极畏难情绪，充分发动群众；克服消极畏难情绪的主要办法，在于摸清灾情，找出对策，树立人定胜天的思想……。他越想，心里越透亮，越透亮，越觉得有办法。
    在大队党总支扩大会议上，张启福首先领导大家具体分析了受灾情况和战胜灾荒的有利条件。一些干部所以产生畏难情绪，原因之一就是被一时的水灾吓住了。经过全面分析情况，一块土地、一项作物的排队，大家就一步步找到了抗灾的门路：一是早秋作物基本上成熟了，可以抢收；二是晚秋作物可以加工管理，减少损失；三是部分绝产土地，可以补种蔬菜，增加收成。会议的结论是，要知难而进，决不能叫困难吓倒。
    接着便召开了社员大会，通过摆灾情、摆有利条件、摆克服困难的办法，提高了群众抗灾的信心。七十多岁的社员李从德回忆了1914年（民国三年）的水灾情况说：“没吃过过去的苦，就不知现在的甜；民国三年遭了大水，吃野菜、树皮不用说，连屋檐草也吃上了。这样，旧政府仍然要粮、要款，不问群众死活，那年咱村就有九十多户出外逃荒，十几个人活活饿死。如今受了水灾，党和政府不光送来了粮和钱，还派来干部登门慰问，帮助排水；兄弟社、队也来支援。要不是新社会，这场水灾还不知饿死多少人呢？”他的话音未落，会场便活跃起来：“对呀！在新社会，有党和毛主席领导，有人民公社，大家再齐心起来干，就没有克服不了的困难。”你一言，我一语，有的表决心，有的提办法。社员们共提出各种救灾办法十多条。
    会后，全队一千多名劳动大军，立即投入了生产救灾的斗争。
          贯彻政策推动救灾
    群众动起来，困难迎刃解。本来认为没法办到的事，现在也办到了。比如为了救活被泥水淤没的大豆，共青团员徐本兰领着社员一叶一叶地把大豆叶洗干净。这个小队的行动影响了全队，经七、八天的奋战，便把淤泥较重的三百亩大豆，逐棵洗了泥。同时，全队三百二十亩早秋地也基本收完；一千四百多亩过水的地瓜大部进行了耠沟、翻蔓和追肥；七百亩水淹较轻的大豆还普遍挑了一遍秧；并且补种了二百多亩秋菜。经过抢救的晚秋作物，又开始生长起来。
    这时随着秋收分配的临近，灾后是否还坚持执行“三包一奖”政策的问题，在一些社员中又产生了新的顾虑。党总支发现这一问题，及时加以解决。明确宣布坚决执行“三包一奖”制度，办法是：根据灾情修订“三包”指标。为了实事求是地解决这一问题，党总支组织各小队干部和老社员深入田间，逐块检查了各种作物的受灾情况，并研究了修订办法。生产小队干部和社员普遍满意。第一小队有二十亩受灾较重的地瓜，原来不想加工管理了，修订“三包”指标后，又马上组织了十七名劳力，耠了一遍沟，追了一次肥。
    把失去的夺回来
    “一定要把灾害损失夺回来”这一战斗口号，成为广大社员的一致行动。在抢救晚秋作物之后，接着就是秋收秋耕秋种。在受灾的情况下，保证适时种足种好小麦，任务是十分艰巨的。但是，人们知道这是战胜灾荒的根本措施，必须完成。大家齐心协力地干，全队小麦播种计划于寒露前三天超额二百亩完成，质量也超过往年。秋收更是精益求精，社员们决心把一切可以收获的东西都收起来，目前全队70％的地瓜地已复收了三遍，复收地瓜达四万多斤。此外，并收获了地瓜蔓、叶，白菜头等十六万多斤。
    争取明年
    夏季丰收
    现在走进尚家庄大队，完全是另外的一种景象了。每天天亮，便有一帮一帮的社员扛着家具，哼着小调，走向田间、场园，个个干劲十足。地里，一眼望不到边的麦苗，绿油油的已离开了地皮。场园上的瓜干囤、秧蔓垛、豆秸垛，都收拾得那样整齐壮观。全队秋收已成定局，据产量核实，经过两个多月的斗争，灾情大大减轻了，全队由减产六成降为两成，五个小队中有四个队超额完成了修订后的包产指标。
    生产救灾的巨大成绩，使社员们进一步树立了彻底战胜灾荒的信心。现在，全队已经安排了冬季生产救灾工作，决定以二百名劳力加强麦田和越冬菜的管理，以一百一十名劳力开展积肥造肥，力争明年夏季收成超过往年；同时，还以二百名劳力开展九种副业生产，增加收入；并妥善安排了社员生活，搞好劳逸结合。
