Don't Believe Adenauer Government's "Nice Words"
	Xi Linsheng
	These days, a grand so-called "Africa Week" is being held in Bonn and other cities in West Germany. This "Africa Week" is indeed unprecedented in scale: it lasts from October 21st to November 5th; and the activities are also varied, including celebrations, reports, exhibitions, film festivals, meetings with African people, and so on, totaling more than fifty items. West German President Lübke serves as the "host" of this event, and the small and large meetings are attended by prominent figures from the West German government.

	In the heavily promoted "Africa Week," West German power figures are dressing up as sympathizers of the oppressed people of Africa, pretending to be "friends" of the African people who have consistently been exploited and enslaved by imperialists. Look how touching the opening speech of the speaker of the West German Federal Assembly, the chairman of the "West German-African Association," Gerstenmaier, is: Germany's early loss of African colonies is "a historical blessing," and this "blessing" makes the German people "have a brotherly feeling" towards the African people. And Vice-Chancellor Erhard even talked about West Germany's "aid to Africa's development," he even forced kinship saying that in many ways, "West Germany is also an underdeveloped country."

	It is said that the West German rulers are spending so much effort to hold a celebration week for the African people, who they used to regard as "inferior races" and trample upon, in order to express "goodwill" to the newly independent African countries and to show West Germany's "friendly desire" to "help developing countries." In this regard, Gerstenmaier also professed that the Germans are not pursuing any colonial or sub-colonial purposes in Africa, in order to show that there is no silver buried here. But despite the West German Adenauer government's painstaking efforts to make the "Africa Week" appear so "kind and friendly" to the African people, this lively show still revealed flaws: at the opening ceremony, Mecklenburg, the colonial governor of Togo under the former "German Empire," sat in a prominent seat as a "distinguished guest." On the one hand, they expressed "brotherly feelings" towards the African people; on the other hand, they respected the executioner who plundered and massacred the people of the African colonies as an honored guest. Where does the so-called "brotherly love" of the West German government come from?

	In fact, whether they have "kind and friendly intentions" towards the African people, and whether they "have brotherly feelings," there is no need to talk any nonsense. Just look at the Adenauer government's attitude towards the Algerian issue. West Germany absolutely refuses to recognize the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria; and Algerians who have been persecuted by French colonialists and fled to West Germany are extradited to France. And the Adenauer government supports the colonial war launched by French imperialism with manpower and material resources. West German Defense Minister Strauss himself admitted that West Germany gave France more than 1 billion marks in just January to April 1958, of which more than 600 million marks were directly used for the Algerian War. In the French colonial army, there are also tens of thousands of mercenaries recruited from West Germany helping French imperialism to massacre the Algerian people. And these mercenaries, according to the decision of the West German Federal Assembly in May this year, have been regarded as serving regular military service in the West German army. Let's take a look at the achievements of these "warriors."

	A report in the West German "Labor World" newspaper once said: "In Algeria, there are actually 35,000 to 40,000 soldiers of German descent. You can meet them everywhere... About half of them are old mercenaries, many are former Nazi members, they are assault teams in the army, and they participate in operations wherever particularly bloody and cruel methods are needed." It is absolutely true that the Adenauer government has "brotherly feelings" not with the African people, but with colonialism. Isn't it more frank and more accurate to say this?

	Nowadays, the Adenauer government has a golden signboard when dealing with African countries: West Germany has no colonies and no colonial interests, so it is "unrelated" to colonialism. It seems that the "historical blessing" has really made this old imperialist country "lay down its butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." West German bourgeois people also greatly publicize this point as West Germany's "good reputation." During this "Africa Week," many people also advocated that West Germany should greatly utilize this "good reputation."

	West Germany has no colonies, this is not because the West German monopoly capital has a particularly kind heart, but because after Germany's defeat in the First World War, its colonies were all snatched away by British and French imperialism. The West German rulers have always been unwilling to accept this. West German Chancellor Adenauer said a long time ago that Germany "must unreservedly devote itself to seizing colonies." Former war criminal and current Adenauer government's financial expert Schacht also said: "It is impossible to prevent Germany from controlling those colonies that belonged to it in the past." And the above-mentioned Gerstenmaier also shouted a few years ago: "The development of Africa in the next twenty years is not only related to the British, Belgians, French, and Portuguese, in short, to the colonial countries to date, but also absolutely certainly...related to us Germans." After talking so much, West Germany is not "unrelated" to colonialism, but greatly related.

	Isn't this the case in reality? For example, the Adenauer government, which claims to be "unrelated" to colonialism, is closely colluding with some old-brand colonialist countries to invest in Africa and other underdeveloped countries. At present, West Germany has issued as much as 3.4 billion marks of capital through the "World Bank" and the "International Development Association" which are tools for international imperialism to jointly exploit newly independent countries. In the "Overseas Countries and Territories Development Fund Organization" of the West European "Common Market," West Germany also has an investment of 200 million marks. In addition, West German monopoly capital has joined forces with British and French monopoly capital to form companies to explore African oil, plunder African minerals, and control African industrial bases. Birds of a feather flock together, knowing their affiliation by choosing friends. Who exactly does the West German government stand with? Isn't it clear whether the Adenauer government is "related" or "unrelated" to colonialism?

	From West Germany's own perspective, it is also actively exporting goods and capital to Africa. From 1951 to the present, West Germany's commodity exports to Africa have increased from 600 million marks to 2.1 billion marks. Private direct investment also reached 150 million marks. Are these investments for "aiding Africa's development"? But according to the "World Report," a mouthpiece of a powerful West German monopoly capital, "the decisive factor for West German investment is profitability." It also said: "Africa needs a large amount of private capital, and this capital will only be invested in Africa when it can be expected to obtain corresponding profits." The so-called "aid, aid" that is shouted loudly is only treating African countries and people as a source of squeezing profits, and objects of exploitation and plunder.

	Of course, at present, the West German government is doing all these dirty tricks with a different set of methods. For example, the bloody military suppression and bloody rule used in the past have now been transformed into golden "aid"; the murderous look has been changed into a sweet smile. The West German "Economist" weekly once added a footnote to this change. It said: "The national liberation movement has ended the colonial era, creating completely new political conditions for development work." Therefore, West Germany "must find new ways and new methods to export capital to developing countries." The West German rulers are worthy of being "outstanding people who know the times," and seeing the wind and water changing, the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, their faces have also changed. In fact, these so-called "new ways and methods" are to make African countries become West Germany's sales market and "a reliable grain and raw material base and reserve" (West German "Military Science Review") through commodity and capital exports. This is exactly as the West German monopoly capital's "Industrial Express Mail" said: In African countries, "whoever has an economic advantage will also have a political advantage." In a word, the truth is revealed: West Germany's ambition for Africa is really not small. And when realizing this ambition, it is also necessary to engage in some tricks similar to "Africa Week." However, the current situation is that the African people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle is constantly rising, and the African people's awareness is constantly increasing. As long as the African people are fully vigilant, then no matter whether it is West Germany's "Africa Week" or "Africa Month," it will not be of much help to Adenauer, this wolf in grandma's clothing.

    莫信阿登纳政府的“好话” 
    席林生
    这几天在西德的波恩和其他城市正举办一个规模宏大的所谓“非洲周”。这个“非洲周”办的确是盛况空前：时间从10月21日到11月5日；活动内容也是花色繁多，有庆祝会、报告会、展览会、电影节、同非洲人士会见会等等五十几项之多。西德总统吕布克担任这次活动的“主持者”，而参加大会小会的也不乏西德政府的显赫人物。
    在大吹大擂的“非洲周”上，西德的当权人物一个个打扮成非洲被压迫人民的同情者，装作一贯受帝国主义者剥削和奴役的非洲人民的“朋友”。看，西德联邦议会议长、“西德—非洲协会”主席格斯登美尔的开幕词讲得多么动听啊：德国很早失去非洲殖民地是“一个历史的恩泽”，这个“恩泽”使德国人对非洲人民“怀有一种兄弟的感情”。而副总理艾哈德更大谈其西德“援助非洲的发展”，他甚至硬攀亲戚说：在许多方面，“西德也是一个不发达国家”。
    据说，西德统治者如此不惜工本为过去被他们视为“劣等民族”而加以践踏的非洲人民举办庆祝周，是为了向新独立的非洲国家表示“亲善之意”，显示西德
  “帮助发展中的国家”的“友好愿望”。对此，格斯登美尔还表白一句：并非德国人在非洲追求任何殖民或次殖民的目的，以示此地无银三百两。但是尽管西德阿登纳政府煞费苦心地把“非洲周”布置得看来对非洲人民如此“亲善和友好”，这出热闹的戏还是漏出了破绽：在开幕式上前“德意志帝国”统治多哥的殖民总督梅克伦堡俨然以“贵宾”身份而高居要座。一面表示对非洲人民“怀有兄弟感情”；却同时又把过去掠夺和屠杀非洲殖民地人民的刽子手敬为上宾，西德政府的所谓“兄弟之情”究竟从何说起？
    其实对非洲人民有没有“亲善友好之意”，是不是“怀有兄弟的感情”，毋需多讲什么废话，只要看看阿登纳政府对阿尔及利亚问题的态度就可以明白。西德对于阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府是绝不承认的；对受法国殖民者迫害而逃到西德的阿尔及利亚人则向法国引渡。而对法帝国主义发动的殖民战争，阿登纳政府却以人力物力加以支援。西德国防部长施特劳斯自己承认：仅在1958年1月到4月西德就给了法国十亿以上马克的巨款，其中有六亿多马克被直接用于阿尔及利亚战争。在法国的殖民军队中也有上万从西德招募去的雇佣兵帮着法帝国主义残杀阿尔及利亚人民。而这些雇佣兵据今年5月西德联邦议会的决定，已被视为在西德陆军中服正规军役。不妨看一看这些“勇士”的业绩吧。
    西德“劳动世界”报的一则报道曾说：“在阿尔及利亚实际上有三万五千到四万名德国血统的士兵。你到处都可以碰到他们。……其中一半左右是老的雇佣兵，许多是前国社党分子，他们是军队中的突击队，凡是需要特别血腥的和残酷的手段地方，他们就参与行动。”千真万确的是：阿登纳政府不是同非洲人民、而是同殖民主义有着“兄弟之情”。这样说难道不是更坦率一些、更准确一些吗？
    当今阿登纳政府对待非洲国家有块金字招牌：西德没有殖民地、没有殖民利益，因此它与殖民主义“无关”。好像“历史的恩泽”真的使这个旧日的帝国主义国家“放下屠刀、立地成佛”了。西德的资产阶级人士还把这点大事宣扬为西德的“好名声”。此次“非洲周”中不少人还鼓吹西德要大大利用这个“好名声”。
    西德没有殖民地，这不是西德垄断资本的心肠特别慈悲，而是因为第一次大战德国失败后它的殖民地都给英法帝国主义抢光了。对于这一点，西德统治者一直是不甘心的。西德总理阿登纳很早以前就说过：德意志“必须无保留地致力于夺取殖民地”。前战犯、现阿登纳政府的财政专家沙赫特也说过：“妨碍德国控制过去属于它的那些殖民地是不可能的”。而上面提到的那个格斯登美尔几年前也叫嚷过：“非洲今后二十年的发展，不仅同英国人、比利时人、法国人和葡萄牙人，简而言之同迄今的殖民国家有关，而且完全肯定地……也同我们德国人有关”。讲来讲去，西德同殖民主义不是“无关”，却是大大有关的。
    事实又何尝不是如此。譬如这个口口声声自称同殖民主义“无关”的阿登纳政府，却偏偏又同一些老牌殖民主义国家密切地勾结一起向非洲和其他不发达国家投资。目前，西德通过国际帝国主义共同剥削新独立国家的工具——“世界银行”和成立中的“国际开发协会”发放的资本就达三十四亿马克。在西欧“共同市场”的“海外国家和领地开发基金组织”中，西德投资也有二亿马克。此外，西德垄断资本又同英国法国的垄断资本合股组成公司勘探非洲石油、掠夺非洲矿藏、控制非洲的工业基地。物以类聚、择友知其属。西德政府到底同谁站在一起？阿登纳政府同殖民主义“有关”还是“无关”不也就一清二楚了吗。
    从西德本身来说，它也正在积极向非洲输出商品和资本。从1951年到现在，西德对非洲的商品输出已从六亿马克增加到二十一亿马克。私人直接投资也达一亿五千万马克。这些投资是为了“援助非洲发展”吗？可是据一家有势力的西德垄断资本的喉舌“世界报”说：“西德投资的决定性因素是有利可图”。它还说：“非洲需要大量的私人资本，而这种资本只有在能指望得到相应利润的时候，才被投入非洲”。叫得震天价响的所谓“援助、援助”，原只是把非洲国家和人民当作压榨利润的源泉、剥削和掠夺的对象。
    当然，目前西德政府在干这一切勾当时是换了一套手法。例如过去用的血淋淋的武力镇压和血腥统治，而现今变换成了黄灿灿的金元“援助”；杀气腾腾的凶相改成了甜迷迷的笑脸。对这种改变，西德“经济学家”周刊曾下过注脚。它说：“民族解放运动结束了殖民主义时代，为开发工作造成了完全新的政治条件”。因此西德“必须寻找新的途径和新的方式来向正在发展中的国家输出资本。”西德统治者不愧为“识时务者为俊杰”，眼看风水转变、东风压倒西风，面孔也随之变了一副。其实这所谓“新的途径和方式”也者，就是通过商品和资本输出，使非洲国家成为西德的销售市场和“一个可靠的粮食和原料基地和备用地”（西德“军事科学评论”）。这正像西德垄断资本的“工业快邮报”说的：在非洲国家中“谁在经济方面占优势，那末它在政治方面也将占优势。”一语道破，真相大白：西德对非洲的野心实在是不小的。而在实现这一野心的时候，搞些类似“非洲周”这一类的名堂，也是必要的。但是，当前的形势是，非洲人民反帝反殖民主义的斗争正在不断高涨，非洲人民的觉悟正在不断提高。只要非洲人民充分警惕，那么不管西德的“非洲周”也罢，“非洲月”也罢，都不会对阿登纳这个狼外婆有太大的帮助。
