    The Yan'an Spirit Inspires People to Move Forward

    "Promoting the Yan'an Spirit" is a resounding call recently made by the Shaanxi Daily over the past three months. The newspaper has continuously published editorials, elaborating on the great significance of promoting the Yan'an Spirit. It has commended outstanding cadres who have maintained the traditions of the Yan'an era, consistently practicing hard work and plain living, and maintaining close ties with the masses. It has also conducted vivid and specific revolutionary tradition education in the form of memoirs and factory histories. This publicity, closely integrated with the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, the whole Party and all the people engaging in agriculture and grain production on a large scale, and improving leadership style, has inspired and educated the vast number of cadres and the masses. Some readers wrote to the editorial department saying that they were deeply inspired by reading these articles and expressed their intention to learn from those comrades who have maintained the glorious traditions of the Yan'an era. Cadres in many places, under the leadership of the Party committee, have conducted studies of "Promoting the Yan'an Spirit." This publicity has played a positive role in promoting current practical work.

    What is the "Yan'an Spirit"? The Shaanxi Daily made an in-depth discussion in its first editorial "Promoting the Yan'an Spirit" published on August 4th. The newspaper pointed out that the "Yan'an Spirit" is the Party's style, and the revolutionary tradition of Yan'an is the Party's tradition, calling on cadres and people throughout the province to further inherit and carry forward this spirit. At the same time, it reported the heroic deeds of Communist Party member Xie Shaowang in leading the masses to transform mountainous areas. Later, it successively introduced the deeds of Comrade Liu Shijie, a cadre of the Zhidan County Party Committee, who voluntarily applied to go to difficult areas, shared weal and woe with the masses, and helped backward teams catch up with wealthy teams; the model deeds of Comrade Zheng Shengyin, the Party Branch Secretary of the Chenqiao Management District of the Zhengzhuang Commune in Yan'an County, who maintained the fine traditions of the People's Army and was originally a veteran Red Army soldier; and the model deeds of Comrade Liu Fenggong, the First Secretary of the Yan'an County Party Committee, who went deep into reality and maintained close ties with the masses. People have specifically understood the meaning of the "Yan'an Spirit" from these advanced figures and found their role models to learn from.

    Closely integrating with current tasks to continuously deepen the "Yan'an Spirit" in people's hearts is a prominent feature of this publicity by the Shaanxi Daily. On September 7th, the newspaper published an editorial entitled "Striving for Strength and Vigorously Developing Grain Production," once again discussing the promotion of the Yan'an Spirit. On October 1st, it also published an editorial entitled "Promote the Yan'an Spirit, Fight Hard in the Fourth Quarter, and Strive for a Double Harvest of Grain and Steel." The newspaper emphasized that promoting the Yan'an Spirit requires doing agriculture on a large scale by ourselves, practicing diligence and thrift in all undertakings, and establishing a good style of diligence and simplicity. It also pointed out that as long as we let go and mobilize the masses and deeply publicize the Party's line, principles, and policies to the masses, the broad masses can overcome any difficulties and complete the great task of socialist construction under the leadership of the Party. This links the publicity of the "Yan'an Spirit" with the current situation, inspiring people to bravely advance towards the realization of current tasks. In coordination with the commentary, the newspaper successively reported that cadres of the Dali County organs carried forward the revolutionary tradition of hard work and plain living, vigorously developed grain production, cultivated autumn fields, and planted more than 3,000 mu of autumn fields; and that the Yan'an Fengzu Footwear Factory adhered to the revolutionary entrepreneurial spirit and maintained close ties with the masses. Many newsletters and news reports have also been published to conduct ideological education for the younger generation on being red in the countryside, specializing in the countryside, working hard, and building a beautiful and happy rural people's commune.

    In order to better conduct revolutionary tradition education for the vast number of readers, the Shaanxi Daily adopted various lively forms. The newspaper opened a "Yan'an Memoirs" column and published many short and excellent articles recalling life in Yan'an. It also published Chairman Mao's inscription "Self-Reliance and Abundant Food and Clothing," and photos of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army engaged in labor production. Later, it opened the "Yan'an Revolutionary Cultural Relics" column, using revolutionary historical facts and objects to educate cadres and the masses. It also introduced in a special page the ten-year development process of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, which has strived for strength, continuously changed its backward appearance, and developed from small to large, as well as the glorious history of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory, a red factory with a long history, from the Jiangxi Revolutionary Base to Yan'an, from an arsenal to an agricultural machinery factory, creating a great cause from scratch. These reports focused on publicizing the fine style of hard work of the People's Army and the working class, fully embodying the inheritance and promotion of the Yan'an Spirit. Through these typical reports, education on striving for strength and building the country with diligence and thrift was conducted for the vast number of readers.

    This publicity of the "Yan'an Spirit" by the Shaanxi Daily has applied and developed the newspaper's original experience in the mass line. For example, the several typical figures they publicized in August were determined in consultation with the Yan'an Prefectural Party Committee. The special page of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory was compiled by the factory itself. Because of the close reliance on the Party committee and the masses, the content of this publicity is relatively rich and profound, and good publicity results have been achieved.

    延安作风鼓舞着人们前进
    “发扬延安作风”，这是最近三个多月来陕西日报响亮地提出的号召。报纸连续发表社论，阐明发扬延安作风的重大意义。表彰了保持延安时代的传统，一贯艰苦朴素、密切联系群众的优秀干部。并以回忆录、工厂史等形式，生动具体地进行了革命传统教育。这一宣传紧密结合增产节约、全党全民大办农业大办粮食和改进领导作风的群众运动，鼓舞和教育了广大干部群众。有的读者给编辑部写信说，读了这些文章，受到深刻的启发，表示要向那些保持延安时代光荣传统的同志学习。不少地方的干部在党委领导下，进行了“发扬延安作风”的学习。这一宣传对当前实际工作起了积极的推动作用。
    什么是“延安作风”？陕西日报在8月4日发表的第一篇社论“发扬延安作风”中作了深入的论述，报纸指出，“延安作风”就是党的作风，延安的革命传统就是党的传统，号召全省干部和人民更进一步继承和发扬光大这种作风。同时报道了共产党员谢绍旺领导群众改造山区的英雄事迹。以后陆续介绍了自动申请到困难地区、与群众同甘共苦、帮助后进队赶富队的志丹县委干部刘士杰同志的事迹；介绍了保持人民军队的优良传统的、原来的红军老战士、现在是延安县郑庄公社陈桥管理区党总支书记郑生银同志的模范事迹；介绍了深入实际、密切联系群众的中共延安县委第一书记刘丰功同志的模范事迹。人们从这些先进人物的身上具体地领会了“延安作风”的含义，找到了自己的学习榜样。
    紧密结合当前任务，使“延安作风”不断深入人心，是陕西日报这项宣传的一个显著特点。9月7日，报纸以“发愤图强大办粮食”为题，发表社论再次论述发扬延安作风。10月1日又发表了“发扬延安作风，奋战四季度，力争粮钢双丰收”的社论。报纸强调发扬延安作风必须自己动手大办农业，必须勤俭办一切事业，树立勤俭朴素的良好作风。并且指出，只要放手发动群众，深入地向群众宣传党的路线方针和政策，广大群众就能在党的领导下，克服任何困难，完成社会主义建设的伟大任务。这就把“延安作风”的宣传和当前的形势联系在一起，鼓舞着人们为实现当前任务而奋勇前进。配合评论，报纸陆续报道了大荔机关干部发扬艰苦朴素的革命传统，大办粮食，务秋开荒，种秋田三千多亩；延安丰足火柴厂坚持革命创业精神，保持与群众的密切联系等事例。又发表了不少通讯、新闻，向青年一代进行红在农村、专在农村、艰苦奋斗、建设美好幸福的农村人民公社的思想教育。
    为了更好地向广大读者进行革命传统的教育，陕西日报采用了各种生动活泼的形式。报纸辟了“延安回忆录”专栏，发表了许多短小精采的回忆延安生活的文章。还发表了毛主席的题字“自己动手，丰衣足食”，和八路军、新四军劳动生产的照片等。以后又开辟了“延安革命文物”这个专栏，用革命的史实和实物教育干部和群众。还以专页形式，介绍了西安人民搪瓷厂十年来发愤图强、不断改变落后面貌，由小到大的发展过程，以及西安农业机械厂这个历史悠久的红色工厂，从江西革命根据地到延安，由兵工厂到农械厂，白手创大业的光辉历程。这些报道集中突出地宣传了人民军队、工人阶级艰苦奋斗的优良作风，充分地体现了延安作风的继承和发扬光大。通过这些典型报道，向广大读者进行了发愤图强，勤俭建国的教育。
    陕西日报这次对于“延安作风”的宣传，运用和发展了这个报纸原有的群众路线经验。如8月份他们宣传的几个典型人物，就是同中共延安地委共同研究确定的。西安农业机械厂的专页，是由这个厂自己动手编的。由于紧密依靠党委、依靠群众，使这一宣传的内容比较丰富、深刻，收到了好的宣传效果。
