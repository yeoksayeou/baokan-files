The newspaper "El Moudjahid" published on the 1st an interview with Abbas, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, by a reporter from the newspaper. Abbas said, "It is an undeniable fact that my trip to People's China has been very instructive. We did not have time to view all the achievements of People's China very carefully and comprehensively. However, the achievements seen in Beijing alone have deeply impressed visitors."

He said, "New China is engaged in construction. I can say that it is already a success. New China displays a kind of serene and immense strength, which deeply impresses visitors. What impressed me most was the self-confidence, the willing conviction, and the constructive discipline that one sees in China. In my opinion, this experience is beneficial even for non-Marxist countries. I am convinced that if our young people were to take a trip to China, they would learn a lot, and they would definitely find many things that could be applied in Algeria. Of course, China's problems clearly have their own characteristics, and Algeria's problems will also have their own characteristics tomorrow. But I believe that some methods that are useful for China are equally useful for Algeria."

He said, "I believe that for the people of a country like ours and underdeveloped countries, to catch up with the West and Europe, there is no other way than to emulate certain methods of the new China, the Soviet Union, and other countries."

In response to a question from a reporter from "El Moudjahid," Abbas said, "Based on the battles we have fought, the external world treats us as two camps, namely the Western camp, which is fighting against us and helping French imperialism to fight against us, and the socialist camp, which is helping our people to wage their own war of liberation. As long as we examine this issue from this perspective, there is no hesitation in estimating the value of the two camps."

    阿巴斯总理谈访华观感
    新中国显示了巨大的力量
    中国建设经验中有许多对阿尔及利亚有益的东西
    “圣战者报”1日登载了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯接见这家报纸记者的谈话。阿巴斯说：“这是一个确定无疑的事实：人民中国之行使我得到许多教益。我们来不及非常仔细和全面地观看人民中国的各项成就。但是，仅仅在北京看到的成就已经使访问者得到深刻的感受。”
    他说：“新中国正在从事建设。我可以说，它已经是一个成功。新中国显示出一种安详的巨大力量，这使访问者得到深刻的印象。使我感受最深的，是那种自信，是人们在中国看到的那种心悦诚服和建设性的纪律。在我看来，这种经验即使对非马克思主义国家来说也是有益的。我确信，如果我们的青年们去一趟中国的话，他们会学到很多东西，他们一定会发现许多可以在阿尔及利亚应用的东西。当然，中国的问题显然有它自己的特点，阿尔及利亚的问题明天也将具有自己的特点。但是我认为，某些方法对中国有用，对阿尔及利亚也同样有用。”
    他说，“我认为对我们这样一个国家的人民和不发达国家，要赶上西方和欧洲，除了仿法新中国、苏联和其他国家的某些办法之外，没有其他办法。”
    阿巴斯在回答“圣战者报”记者的问题时说，“根据我们所进行的战斗来看，外部世界对待我们分成两个阵营，即同我们作战并帮助法帝国主义同我们作战的西方阵营，以及帮助我国人民进行自己的解放战争的社会主义阵营。只要从这个角度来审查这个问题，对两个阵营的价值的估计，就没有犹豫的余地”。
