Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 21st. Albanian newspapers "People's Voice" and "Solidarity" recently published commentaries on the U.S. election, pointing out that the new Democratic government in the United States will definitely not make any changes to its aggressive policies.

The "People's Voice" commentary said that one cannot expect the new government, which will take office next January, to learn from the failures of Eisenhower and Nixon's adventurous policies. One cannot expect it to consider the demands of millions of Americans and thereby pursue realistic policies that take into account the current balance of world power. The commentary pointed out that this is because: "First, the Democratic Party also represents the aggressive plans and enslavement policies of the large monopoly groups. It was during the rule of former Democratic President Truman that the American war of aggression was launched and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization aggressive bloc was established. Second, the party's current election platform and Kennedy's campaign speeches, while emphasizing the great decline in America's international prestige, call for continued arms race as a way out."

The "Solidarity" newspaper, in a commentary titled "Presidential Election Brings No Change to America's Aggressive Policy," said: "In fact, the election platforms of the two parties and the countless remarks made by Kennedy and Nixon during the election campaign are only different in form, while their content is completely the same, namely, a policy of aggression, war, and suppression." The commentary went on to say that one cannot expect them to be different, because whether it is Kennedy and Nixon or their parties, they are only representatives and protectors of the monopoly groups, trusts, and banks of American financial capital; even Kennedy himself is a member of an American billionaire family.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸评美国总统选举结果
    美国新政府不会改变侵略政策
    新华社地拉那21日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”和“团结报”最近分别就美国大选发表评论，指出美国民主党新政府决不会使侵略政策有任何改变。
    “人民之声报”评论中说，不能期望明年1月上台的新政府会从艾森豪威尔和尼克松的冒险政策的失败中吸取教训，不能期望它会考虑千百万美国人的要求，从而奉行考虑到当前世界力量的对比的现实政策。评论指出，这是因为：“第一，民主党代表也是大垄断集团的侵略计划和奴役政策的执行人。正是前民主党总统杜鲁门统治期间发动了美国侵略战争，建立了北大西洋公约组织侵略集团。第二，现在这个党的竞选纲领和肯尼迪的竞选讲话在强调美国的国际威信大大下降的同时，要求以继续军备竞赛来作为出路。”
    “团结报”在题为“总统选举没有给美国的侵略政策带来任何改变”的评论中说：“事实上两党的竞选纲领和肯尼迪、尼克松在竞选活动中发表的无数言论，只有形式上的不同，而内容完全是一样的，即侵略、战争和镇压的政策。”评论接着说，也不能期望它们有所不同，因为不论是肯尼迪和尼克松或是他们的党，都只不过是美国大金融资本的垄断集团托辣斯和银行的代表和保护者，甚至肯尼迪自己就是美国亿万富翁家族的成员。
