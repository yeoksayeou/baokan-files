Not Discouraged by Disaster, Not Daunted by Difficulty
    Liujiashan Management District Fights Disaster Seven Times to Seize Grain from the Heavens
    Party Branch Fully Plays a Fighting Role, Ensuring Smooth Production Amidst Major Disaster
    (By Our Newspaper) The Liujiashan Management District (i.e., production team, the basic accounting unit of the commune) of Cheng Gui Commune in Lin County, Shanxi Province, suffered extremely severe natural disasters this year, the severity of which exceeded the largest disaster in recent decades, the third year of the Guangxu reign. However, thanks to the strong leadership of the Management District Party Branch, and the unparalleled superiority of the people's commune, the cadres and masses were not intimidated by the disaster but, filled with revolutionary optimism, launched a vigorous mass campaign to fight the disaster and achieved great victory.
    The Liujiashan Management District is a hilly area, with more than 90% of the land being slopes and terraces. The entire management district has 404 households, with 1,207 people. This year, the more than 8,100 mu of grain and 500 mu of cash crops they planted suffered rare droughts, winds, hail, frost and other natural disasters, resulting in a grain yield reduction of more than 60%.
    In order to seize grain from the heavens, and in order to reduce the state's grain supply needs, the members of this management district, under the strong leadership of the Party branch, launched a serious struggle against natural disasters. They repeatedly replanted on the sloping fields seven times: If they couldn't grow wheat, they grew beans; if they couldn't grow beans, they grew millet; if they still couldn't grow millet, they grew broomcorn millet; if the broomcorn millet didn't sprout, they changed to buckwheat; seeing that they couldn't grow grain, they seized the opportunity to grow vegetables. In the process of growing melons and vegetables in a big way, there were also many difficulties. They planted them continuously six times, but they couldn't catch the seedlings due to drought and wild animal damage. The seventh time, they carried water to water them one by one, and sent people to guard them for nine days and nine nights before the seedlings were preserved. In the case of extreme water shortage, all the members turned out and carried more than 53,000 dan of water in total, watering them piece by piece and plant by plant seven times, in order to ensure the growth of melons and vegetables. The entire management district planted more than 660 mu of pumpkins, turnips, radishes, and other crops, and has harvested more than 320,000 jin of various vegetables, with another 110,000 jin about to be harvested.
    At the same time, the Party branch also organized members to engage in sideline production such as burning lime, weaving baskets, and raising chickens. Therefore, in the case of severe disasters, the income of the members did not decrease much.
    The Management District Party Branch also vigorously ran public canteens, based on the principle of grasping production with one hand and grasping life with the other. The seven canteens in the entire management district have always adhered to the system of rationing grain according to the number of people, assigning quotas to households, eating with tickets, and returning surpluses to individuals, encouraging members to save grain. In order to overcome the disaster, each canteen has properly arranged a grain consumption plan from now until the summer harvest next year, and earnestly achieves eating grain on a monthly and quarterly basis, which can not only ensure the physical health of the members, but also ensure the smooth progress of production.
    The reason why the Liujiashan Management District was able to forge ahead and overcome the disaster bravely and solidly arrange people's lives in the case of severe disasters is that it has the Party's strong leadership, puts politics in command in everything, and conscientiously implements the Party's policies of production and disaster relief. Secondly, the 31 Party members, 16 League members, and 50% of the poor and lower-middle peasants of the total number of farmers in the management district are the basic forces to overcome the disaster. Among the nine members of the Party branch committee, seven of them are in charge of leading and taking the lead in production in each production team. Party Branch Secretary Feng Xiujun adopted a combination of staying at selected spots and running around to guide the overall work, and actively participated in labor with a clean and self-disciplined style, leading and driving all cadres and the masses. The deputy secretary not only grasped production, but also grasped life. The Management District Party and League branches gave full play to the enthusiasm of all Party and League members. Each Party member or League member contracted a piece of land, and was able to understand the thoughts and opinions of the members in a timely manner, and unite all the members closely around the Party.
    In the face of the disaster, some people had a fear of difficulty, and the Party branch promptly carried out in-depth political and ideological education on preventing discouragement in the face of disaster, preventing timidity in the face of difficulties, and preventing ideological confusion in the face of hard times, establishing a strong confidence in overcoming the disaster among the members, and thus achieved great success, ensuring that production can proceed smoothly in the face of a major disaster.

    面对灾害不气馁　面对困难不胆怯
    刘家山管理区七次抗灾播种向天夺粮
    党支部充分发挥战斗作用，在大灾中保证生产顺利进行
    本报讯　山西临县城桂公社刘家山管理区，（即生产队，是公社基本核算单位）今年遭受了极为严重的自然灾害，灾害程度超过了近几十年来最大灾害的光绪三年。但由于管理区党支部的坚强领导，又有无比优越的人民公社的伟大力量，干部和群众没有被灾荒所吓倒，而是充满革命的乐观主义，干劲十足地展开了轰轰烈烈的群众性的抗灾斗争，并且取得巨大胜利。
    刘家山管理区是个丘陵地区，90％以上的土地是坡地和梯田。全管理区四百零四户，一千二百零七口人，今年播种的八千一百多亩粮食和五百亩经济作物，由于遭受少有的旱、风、雹、冻等自然灾害，粮食减产六成以上。
    为了向天夺粮，为了少要国家供应粮食，这个管理区的社员在党支部的坚强领导下，同自然灾害展开了严重的斗争。他们曾在坡田上反复抢种过七次：种麦子不成，种豆子；种豆子不成，种谷子；种谷还不成，再种糜子；糜子种下不出苗，改种荞麦；眼看种粮食不成了，就抓时机种菜。在大种瓜菜的过程中，也是困难重重，前后连续种过六次，都因旱灾和野兽为害，捉不住苗。第七次是担水点浇，出土后派人看管了九天九夜，才保住了苗。在水源奇缺的情况下，全体社员一齐出动，共担了五万三千多担水，逐片逐株浇了七遍，才保证了瓜菜的成长。全管理区共种下南瓜、蔓菁、萝卜等六百六十多亩，已收获各种菜蔬三十二万多斤，即将收获的还有十一万多斤。
    同时，党支部还组织社员大搞烧石灰、编筐、养鸡等副业生产。因此，在严重灾害的情况下，社员的收入并不减少很多。
    管理区党支部还根据一手抓生产，一手抓生活的原则，大力办好公共食堂。全管理区七个食堂，始终坚持吃粮以人定量，指标到户，凭票吃饭，节余归己的制度，鼓励社员节约粮食。为了战胜灾荒，各个食堂已妥善安排了从现在到明年夏收这一段的用粮计划，切实做到按月、按季吃粮，这样既能保证社员的身体健康，又能保证生产的顺利进行。
    刘家山管理区在严重灾害的情况下，所以能勇往直前地战胜灾害，扎扎实实地安排人民生活，关键在于有党的坚强领导，事事政治挂帅，认真贯彻执行了党的生产救灾的政策。其次管理区的三十一名党员、十六名团员，还有占总农户50％的贫农和下中农，他们战胜灾害的斗志，是克服困难的基本力量。党支部的九个委员中，有七个委员分别在各生产队领导生产带头生产。党支书冯秀俊采取蹲点和跑面相结合的办法，指挥全面工作，并以廉洁克己的作风积极参加劳动，领导和带动全体干部和群众。副支书既抓生产，又抓生活。管理区党、团支部充分发挥了全体党团员的积极作用。每个党员或团员都分片包干，及时了解社员的思想情况和意见，把全体社员紧紧地团结在党的周围。
    在大灾面前，有的人有畏难情绪，党支部就及时进行面对灾害防气馁、面对困难防胆怯、面对艰苦岁月防思想混乱等深入的政治思想教育，在社员中树立了坚强的战胜灾害的信心，因此取得巨大成绩，保证在大灾荒面前生产能够顺利进行。（附图片）
