Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 7th: Guided by the idea of "rushing ahead, not lagging behind," the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Steel Plant is vigorously strengthening leadership over the first shift's production, promoting a substantial and continuous leap forward in steel production. Now, starting at zero o'clock every day, from the plant level down to the workshops and work sections, leading cadres personally grasp the production of the first shift in order to create a favorable situation in the first shift's production and encourage workers in the second and third shifts to better complete their plans. According to incomplete statistics from the most recent twenty-odd days, the first shift each day can produce one more furnace of high-quality steel than in the past; the average daily production level of the entire plant from October 1st to 23rd increased by 28.1% compared to the same period in September.

With the deepening development of the increased production and conservation movement, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Steel Plant Party Committee gradually realized that the quality of the first shift's (zero o'clock to eight o'clock) production each day is a crucial key to determining the successful completion of the daily plan. As the saying goes, "The day's plan lies in the morning," if the first shift gets off to a flying start, it will greatly boost the morale of the other two shifts of workers and lay the foundation for a production leap forward in the other two shifts.

Based on this understanding, the plant Party committee appointed Deputy Secretary Guo Baozhu of the Party Committee to be responsible for leading the production of the first shift; the Party branch secretaries or workshop directors of each workshop, and the Party branch secretaries and chief furnace operators of each open-hearth furnace, also take turns specifically grasping the production of the first shift. These leading cadres responsible for leading the production of the first shift arrive at work early before taking over each day, deeply understand the situation of the previous shift, and then hold a pre-shift meeting to clarify the production key for that shift and arrange the shift's combat plan. At the mid-shift inspection meeting, the leading cadres also promptly summarize the work of the first four hours, point out the combat goals for the next four hours, and deploy efforts to seize the final victory. Functional departments such as the production department and supply department also dispatched fifteen section chiefs and general cadres to serve as advisors at the furnace during the first shift, assisting in resolving problems that arise temporarily. Service units such as the canteen and health center also vigorously support the production of the first shift. The cooks prepare the meals on time, ensuring that the first shift workers eat on time and eat well.

After the measures of vigorously strengthening leadership over the production of the first shift and mobilizing the entire plant to support the production of the first shift were implemented, the morale of the first shift workers was greatly boosted. Workers universally launched a competition to do a good job in the production of the first shift. They treat the deep night as daytime, vowing to seize a good start and strive to be role models. The workers of the first shift of the No. 4 open-hearth furnace, who are at the forefront of this competition, launched an opponent race and cross race between assistants and assistants, assistants and furnace operators, and assistants and workers as soon as the first battle on October 14th began. Scrap steel, ore, white ash and other raw materials and materials filled the charging platform, and the charging machine sent batch after batch of raw materials into the open-hearth furnace's molten pool. From repairing the furnace, adding materials, heating, to adding molten iron, the first four processes took only two hours, shortening the time by one hour compared to the past. Then, all the workers in the furnace continuously broke through four key problems such as the small cross-section of the water jacket and the fire blocking at the furnace head during the refining period, and finally completed a furnace of rapid steelmaking in ten hours and fifteen minutes. The achievements of the No. 4 open-hearth furnace encouraged the first shift workers of each furnace. They quickly caught up and learned from the advanced experience of the No. 4 open-hearth furnace of "rushing ahead step by step," and soon created new achievements.

The workers participating in the first shift steelmaking not only pay attention to making more steel themselves, but also pay attention to preparing for the production of the next two shifts, so as to achieve ring-to-ring connection and shift-to-shift promotion, so that steelmaking production is successful every day. Now, a new atmosphere of communist collaboration to ensure daily success has appeared everywhere on the open-hearth furnace platform of this plant. Zhang Decai, the furnace operator of the first shift of the No. 7 open-hearth furnace, led the workers to complete a furnace of rapid steelmaking in seven hours and fifty minutes in the production of the first shift on October 20th. However, they were not satisfied with the achievements they had already made. In order to strive for complete furnace success, all the workers in the shift prepared various raw materials such as ore and scrap steel needed for the next shift while striving for their own high output. In order to let the second shift catch up with their shift quickly, Zhang Decai also took the initiative to stay and make steel with Deng Baiyan, the furnace operator of the second shift, operating while demonstrating and imparting experience. With the help of Zhang Decai's shift, the second shift completed a furnace of rapid steelmaking in eight hours and fifty minutes. Starting from Zhang Decai's shift, the No. 7 open-hearth furnace has continuously produced five furnaces of rapid steelmaking and won the red flag for rapid steelmaking.

Under the impetus and encouragement of the first shift, the workers of the second and third shifts throughout the plant are also stepping forward with high morale. They go to the furnace early every day to first understand the situation and learn from experience. After production begins, they compete with each other between furnaces and between groups, fiercely attacking key problems, so that one production key after another is overcome, and good news of shift-by-shift success is continuously reported. In late October, the average time for the entire plant to produce a furnace of steel was shortened by thirty minutes compared to the first ten days of the month.

    书记到第一线加强具体领导　科室干部到炉前充当参谋
    鞍钢第一钢厂狠抓头一班确保日日红
    据新华社鞍山7日电　鞍山钢铁公司第一炼钢厂在赶前不赶后的思想指导下，大力加强第一班生产的领导，推动了炼钢生产大幅度持续跃进。现在，每天凌晨零点开始，从厂到各车间和工段，都有领导干部亲自抓第一班生产，以便在第一班生产中创造出有利形势，鼓舞第二班和第三班职工更好地完成计划。据最近二十几天的不完全统计，每天头一班可比过去多出一炉优质钢；全厂从10月1日到23日的平均日产水平，比9月同期增长了28.1％。
    随着增产节约运动的深入发展，鞍钢第一炼钢厂党委逐渐认识到：每天第一班（零点到八点）生产好坏，是决定日计划完成好坏的重要关键。俗语说得好，“一日之计在于晨”，如果第一班旗开得胜，就会大大鼓舞其它两班职工的士气，并为其它两班生产跃进打下基础。
    基于这一认识，厂党委抽出党委副书记郭宝珠，负责领导第一班的生产；各车间的党总支书记或车间主任，各平炉的党支部书记和总炉长，也都轮班具体地抓第一班生产。这些负责领导第一班生产的领导干部，每天接班之前就提前上班，深入了解上一班情况，然后召开班前会，明确本班的生产关键，安排一班的战斗计划。在班中检查会上，领导干部又及时地总结前四小时工作，指出后四小时的战斗目标，部署夺取最后的胜利。生产科和供应科等职能科室，也抽出十五名科长和一般干部，在第一班上炉当参谋，协助解决临时发生的问题。食堂和保健所等服务单位，也都大力支援第一班生产。炊事员们按时把饭菜做好，让第一班工人吃得及时吃得好。
    大力加强对第一班生产的领导、发动全厂支援第一班生产的措施实行以后，大大鼓舞了第一班职工的士气。职工们普遍开展了搞好第一班生产的竞赛。他们把深夜当白天，誓夺开门红，力争做榜样。走在这场竞赛前面的四号平炉第一班职工，在10月14日首班战斗一揭开，就展开了助手与助手、助手与炉长、助手与工人之间的对手赛和交叉赛。废钢、矿石、白灰等原料和材料布满了料台，装料机把一槽槽原料送进平炉熔池。从补炉、加料、加热到兑铁水，前四道工序仅用了两小时，比以前缩短一小时。接着全炉职工又在精炼期内，连续攻破了水套断面小、炉头挡火等四项关键，终于用十点十五分钟完成了一炉快速炼钢。四号平炉的成就鼓舞了各个炉子的第一班职工。他们急起直追，学习四号平炉“步步赶前”的先进经验，很快也都创造出了新的成绩。
    参加第一班炼钢的职工，不仅注意自己多炼钢，而且注意为后两班生产做准备，做到环环衔接，班班促进，使炼钢生产日日红。现在这个厂的平炉台上，到处都出现了保证全日红的共产主义大协作的新气象。七号平炉甲班炉长张德才在10月20日第一班生产中，领导职工用七点五十分钟完成了一炉快速炼钢。但是他们没有满足于自己已经取得的成就。为了争取全炉满堂红，全班职工在力争自己高产的同时，就将下班需要的矿石、废钢等各种原料相继准备好。为了让第二班迅速赶上自己班，张德才还主动留下来同第二班炉长邓百岩炼钢，一边操作，一边表演传授经验。第二班在张德才班的帮助下，用八点五十分钟完成了一炉快速炼钢。七号平炉从张德才班开始，曾接连炼出五炉快速炼钢，获得了快速炼钢红旗。
    在第一班的推动和鼓舞下，全厂做第二班和第三班的职工，也都斗志昂扬地步步赶前。他们每天提前上炉先摸情况学经验，生产开始后就炉与炉、组与组之间相互比武，猛攻关键，使生产关键一个一个被攻克，接连不断传出班班红的捷报。10月下旬，全厂每炼一炉钢的时间，平均比上旬缩短了三十分钟。
