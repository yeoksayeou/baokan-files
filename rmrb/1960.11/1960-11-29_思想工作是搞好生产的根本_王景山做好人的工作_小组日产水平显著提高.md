Ideological Work Is the Foundation of Good Production
Wang Jingshan Does a Good Job of Working with People, and the Team's Daily Output Level Increases Significantly

    (Our report) According to the Lüda Daily: Wang Jingshan, the Party Group Leader of the Underframe Welding Team in the Metal Structure Workshop of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, under the leadership of the Party Branch, conscientiously focuses on ideological work, continuously improves the political and ideological level of the team's workers, and ensures the implementation of the Party's principles and policies, thereby continuously improving the team's production. Currently, the team's daily output has increased by 1.2 times compared to the beginning of the year, maintaining the glorious title of high-yield, high-quality, accident-free red flag team for eighteen months.

    Advanced Thinking Creates Advanced Production Results

    Wang Jingshan, after more than five years of working as a Party Group Leader, deeply understands that the Party Group is the core of the production team, and the Party Group Leader is the leader of the Party Group. Therefore, the Party Group Leader must comprehensively grasp all tasks of the production team. To grasp and improve these tasks, the Party Group Leader must earnestly do the work of working with people.

    When Wang Jingshan first started working as a Party Group Leader, because he was not clear enough about the tasks he was responsible for, he would address whatever problems came up, rarely conducting persuasive education for the masses. Therefore, at that time, the Party's principles, policies, resolutions, and instructions were not well implemented in the team, work always lagged behind other teams, workers had many ideological problems, and output and quality were not high. The Party General Branch Secretary and Branch Secretary spoke to Wang Jingshan one after another, telling him that he must do a good job in ideological work in order to do a good job in production, and that ideological work is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in production. Wang Jingshan returned to the team and talked with the workers, soliciting their opinions. In the conversation, he found that everyone was unsure about the team's capabilities, and therefore dared not do it. So he organized everyone to calculate: as long as everyone is punctual and everyone guarantees quality, output can be increased. This gave Wang Jingshan a great education, making him deeply feel the importance of grasping ideology. From then on, he began to pay attention to grasping ideological work.

      Using a Variety of Methods to Solve Ideological Problems

    To solve ideological problems, there must be good methods. In his daily work, Wang Jingshan paid special attention to grasping ideology in the following aspects: one is to grasp ideology in the process of movements, ensuring the implementation of the Party's principles and policies. Whenever a central task is assigned, Wang Jingshan first organizes all team workers to study documents, conduct theoretical discussions, and clarify their understanding; during the movement, he constantly pays attention to discovering and solving the workers' ideological problems, ensuring the healthy development of the movement. For example, this spring, the Municipal Party Committee and the Factory Party Committee issued a call to vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution. Although the team workers studied the documents, clarified their understanding, and formulated a plan to develop a production linkage line to get rid of heavy physical labor, when the design of the linkage line and tire turner came out, they encountered difficulties such as lack of materials, inability to process, and some technical difficulties. At this time, some people developed slackness and fear of difficulties. Wang Jingshan talked with each worker, on the one hand persuading everyone to use the "pauper spirit" to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and materials, and on the other hand mobilizing everyone to find materials and think of ways to process them. He also used the fact that riveter Zhang Xinguang and others in his workshop had worked hard for three days and nights, failing fifty times, to create an electric material handling cart to educate everyone, strengthening the team workers' confidence and determination, and finally completing the project that was planned to be completed in half a year in two months, doubling the daily output and saving 20% of manpower. In addition, in order to learn more about the team workers' thoughts and living conditions, Wang Jingshan not only grasped ideology during the production process and amateur activities in the factory, but also went to the workers' homes to conduct ideological work. He visited forty of the team's forty-nine workers. Through family visits, he further familiarized himself with the workers' ideological situation. Young worker Qu Yong'ao once showed a lack of enthusiasm in his work. Wang Jingshan talked to him three or four times, but it didn't seem to have much effect. Wang Jingshan visited Qu Yong'ao's home on Sunday and discovered that Qu Yong'ao had some difficulties in his life. After helping him, Qu Yong'ao's work was more active than before. Wang Jingshan not only pays attention to grasping ideology himself, but is also good at relying on activists to grasp ideology and help the masses progress. Wang Jingshan usually unites the production, trade union, and Communist Youth League team leaders, all Party members in the team, advanced producers, red flag bearers, and veteran workers around him, and through them, he understands and helps the masses solve various problems. Each of them has someone to help, and Wang Jingshan convenes them every week to report on the ideological situation and explain work methods. Apprentice Zheng Min used to be very active in his work, but suddenly missed work on a windy day. It was learned from the report of Communist Youth League member Li Guiying that Zheng Min missed work because his family had not mailed his cotton clothes. Later, Wang Jingshan helped Zheng Min solve the problem of winter clothes, and Zheng Min was as active as ever.

    Wang Jingshan used these methods to comprehensively and meticulously grasp and solve the ideological problems of each person and each period, so that the team's forty-odd workers were closely united, making him the confidant of the masses.

    Strengthen Policy Learning, Care About the Progress of the Entire Team

    The reason why Wang Jingshan can lead the team is that he constantly pays attention to learning and strictly demands himself. He often takes the initiative to obtain the leadership and assistance of the Party branch. In addition to reporting to the branch once a week as a fixed schedule, he also makes plans with a beginning and an end whenever he does a job, and conducts it after the branch has reviewed and approved it, which avoids many detours. For example, at the beginning of this year when mechanization was vigorously promoted, he promptly sent the plan for developing the linkage line to the Party branch for review, and according to the branch's instructions, he supplemented the completion date and measures for each task, which made the plan more specific and achieved the expected results.

    Secondly, he can also consistently and unremittingly take the study of Chairman Mao's works and the Party's principles and policies as the fundamental guarantee for raising his awareness and doing a good job. He has successively studied more than a dozen works of Chairman Mao, such as "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Work Methods," in light of the actual work situation. For example, after studying the article "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Work Methods," he further realized the principle that only by caring about the well-being of the masses can we do a good job. Therefore, in his work, he is more concerned about the political and ideological progress of the team's workers, the production and life of the team's workers, and the masses say that he is the "key to happiness."

### 思想工作是搞好生产的根本  王景山做好人的工作  小组日产水平显著提高

    思想工作是搞好生产的根本
    王景山做好人的工作  小组日产水平显著提高
    本报讯　据旅大日报消息：大连机车车辆厂金属结构车间底架电焊小组党小组长王景山，在党支部的领导下，认真抓思想工作，不断提高小组工人的政治思想水平，保证了党的方针、政策的贯彻执行，使小组生产不断提高。目前，这个小组的日产量比年初提高了一点二倍，保持了十八个月的高产、优质、无事故红旗小组的光荣称号。
    先进的思想才能创造出先进的生产成绩
    王景山经过五年多的党小组长工作，深深地体会到：党小组是生产小组的核心，而党的小组长又是党小组的领导人。因此，党的小组长对生产小组的各项工作必须全面地抓好。党小组长要把这些工作抓起来、抓好，必须切切实实做人的工作。
    王景山在开始做党小组长工作时，由于对自己所担当的任务不够明确，工作是碰到什么抓什么，很少向群众进行说服教育。因此，那时党的方针、政策、决议、指示等在小组里不能很好地贯彻执行，工作总是落在别的小组后面，小组工人思想问题多，产量质量也不高。党总支书记、支部书记先后找王景山谈话，告诉他要做好思想工作，才能搞好生产，思想工作是搞好生产的根本保证。王景山回到小组就找工人交谈，征求大家的意见。在谈话中，他发现大家对小组有多大能力心中没有底，因而不敢干。于是就组织大家算了一笔账：只要人人不欠勤，人人保证质量，就可以使产量增加。这一次给王景山很大的教育，使他深深感到抓思想的重要性。从这以后，他就开始注意了抓思想工作。
      运用多种多样的方法解决思想问题
    解决思想问题，必须有好的方法。王景山在日常工作中特别注意从下列几个方面抓思想：一个是在运动过程中抓思想，保证党的方针政策的贯彻执行。在每一项中心工作分配下来的时候，王景山都首先组织全组工人学习文件，进行务虚，明确认识；在运动进行中，更是不断注意发现与解决工人的思想问题，保证运动的健康发展。如今年春天市委和工厂党委发出了大搞技术革新和技术革命的号召，小组工人虽然经过学习文件、明确认识，制订了规划，决定搞生产联动线，摆脱笨重的体力劳动。但是，当联动线和转胎的设计搞出后，遇到了没有材料、无法加工以及技术上的一些困难，这时，有一部分人产生了松劲畏难情绪。王景山和每个工人进行交谈，一方面说服大家要用“穷棒子精神”克服原料材料不足的困难，一方面发动大家去找材料，想办法加工。他并且以本车间铆工张心光等人经过三昼夜的奋战，五十次的失败，搞成电动化运料小车的事实来教育大家，使小组工人坚定了信心和决心，终于使计划半年内完成的项目，用两个月的时间就完成了，使日产量翻了一番，还节约人力20％。另外，王景山为了更多地了解小组工人的思想和生活情况，不仅在厂内的生产过程中和业余活动中抓思想，而且还到工人家里进行思想工作。小组四十九名工人，他就走访了四十家。通过家庭走访，他进一步地熟悉了工人的思想情况。青年工人曲永翱曾一度表现工作不够积极，王景山和他谈过三四次话也不见有多大效果。王景山星期天就到曲永翱家访问，这才发现曲永翱生活上有些困难；经过帮助以后，曲永翱的工作比以前积极了。王景山不仅自己注意抓思想，而且善于依靠积极分子抓思想，帮助群众进步。王景山日常把生产、工会、共青团的小组长和小组的全体党员、小组内的先进生产者、红旗手、老工人都团结在自己的周围，通过他们了解和帮助群众解决各种问题。他们每人都有一个帮助的对象，王景山每周都召集他们汇报一次思想情况，交代工作方法。徒工郑敏往常工作很积极，有一个刮风天却突然欠了勤。从共青团员李桂英汇报中知道郑敏是因为家中没有把棉衣邮来。后来王景山帮助郑敏把冬衣问题解决了，郑敏照旧很积极。
    王景山就通过这些办法，全面地、细致地掌握和解决了每个人、每个时期的思想问题，使小组四十余名工人都紧密地团结在一起，使自己成为群众的知心人。
    加强政策学习，关心全组的进步
    王景山所以能把小组领导起来，是他时时刻刻注意学习与严格要求自己的结果。他经常主动地取得党支部的领导与帮助。除每星期固定一次向支部请示汇报工作外，每逢做一项工作，也都是有头有尾地作出计划，待支部审查批准后再进行，这就使工作少走许多弯路。如在今年年初大搞机械化时，他及时将搞联动线的规划送到党支部审查，根据支部的指示，补充了每项工作的完成日期和措施，结果使规划更加具体了，收到了预期的效果。
    其次，他还能始终如一，坚持不懈地把学习毛主席的著作和党的方针、政策，作为提高觉悟、做好工作的根本保证。他结合实际工作情况，先后学习了毛主席的《矛盾论》、《实践论》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》等十余篇著作。如他在学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文后，进一步认识到：只有关心群众生活，才能做好工作的道理。所以在工作中他更加关心小组工人的政治思想进步、小组工人生产和生活，群众都说他是“开心的钥匙”。
