Editor's Note: Winter irrigation is an important measure to prevent spring drought, strive for high wheat yields, and ensure timely sowing of spring crops. This year, our country has again experienced a severe drought, with some areas not receiving substantial rainfall for one to two hundred days, severely affecting the growth of wheat, cotton, and other crops. Will a similar drought occur next year? To prevent such occurrences, vigorously promoting winter irrigation this winter to increase soil moisture content is a crucial measure. Striving to eliminate spring drought this winter is an important aspect of gaining the initiative in agricultural production.

Winter irrigation is water storage irrigation carried out on overwintering crops and white land intended for spring sowing before and after winter freezing. It is an important measure for securing high yields of summer-harvested crops, especially winter wheat, and for timely sowing of cotton, as well as an effective method for preventing and combating spring drought. From the perspective of China's climate characteristics, except for a few areas with abundant spring rainfall, most areas experience little rain in winter and spring, especially in North and Northwest China, where the average annual rainfall is only 300 to 600 millimeters, and winter-spring rainfall accounts for only about 10%. However, the water demand of winter wheat during this period generally exceeds the rainfall by several times. Therefore, spring drought seriously threatens wheat growth and the timely sowing of spring crops. Production practices have proven that large-scale winter irrigation can greatly overcome the threat of spring drought. Farmers in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi and other provinces call winter irrigation of wheat "root consolidating water", meaning that winter irrigation can promote root development and tillering; some also say, "Cotton requires full stands, winter irrigation is essential," which means that winter irrigation of cotton fields is a crucial key to ensuring full and even emergence.

The yield-increasing effect of winter irrigation is very significant. According to surveys in typical areas of the North, under the same other conditions, winter-irrigated wheat generally yields 5% to 10% more than non-irrigated wheat, with the highest increases reaching over 20% to 30%; cotton yields increase by 3% to 15%.

Winter Irrigation's Several Effects

Based on investigations and experimental observations on winter irrigation in various places, the following effects can be summarized:

1. Storing Water and Conserving Moisture, Preventing Spring Drought. Land that has been winter-irrigated, after implementing moisture-conserving measures such as harrowing, loosening the soil, and rolling, has a soil moisture content that is 5% to 8% higher than that of land without winter irrigation in the following spring. According to experimental observations in the Shijin Canal irrigation area of Hebei Province from 1953 to 1957, winter irrigation of wheat was carried out in mid-November, combined with the application of farmyard manure once during irrigation. The surface soil was loosened and rolled seven to eight days after irrigation, and "topsoil" harrowing was carried out before and after thawing in the coming year. The soil moisture content at the time of wheat green-up was maintained at over 20% to 26%, which could basically meet the water demand for green-up. Wheat land without winter irrigation, even with the same moisture-conserving measures, had soil moisture below 14%, and wheat growth was inhibited to a certain extent due to insufficient water. According to a survey of water storage irrigation in cotton fields in Gaotang County, Shandong Province, in 1958, after winter irrigation was carried out in early and mid-December, two to three harrowings were performed in winter to conserve moisture. By the time of sowing in early April of the following year, the soil moisture content reached 15.25%, while land without winter irrigation only had 7.9%, which was lower than the suitable moisture content for cotton sowing (12% to 15%). Therefore, winter irrigation not only ensures the water demand of overwintering crops such as wheat in winter and early spring, achieving safe overwintering and early green-up, but also provides cotton fields with suitable moisture, facilitating timely sowing and emergence.

2. Regulating Soil Temperature, Preventing Frost Damage, and Loosening the Soil. Winter irrigation and non-winter irrigation have very different soil temperature variations due to the different soil moisture levels, as the heat capacity of water is greater than that of soil. The soil temperature of soils with more moisture is higher than that of soils with less moisture throughout the winter, and the daily variation range is also more stable. According to experimental observations by the Hebei Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences in the Shijin Canal irrigation area in 1955, from November 1954 to February 1955, the soil temperature in winter-irrigated wheat fields was on average 0.2 to 1.7 degrees Celsius higher than that in non-winter-irrigated fields. The daily variation range was also smaller. On January 15, from 7:00 to 21:00, the soil temperature change at a depth of 10 centimeters in the surface layer was -7.7 to 5.5 degrees Celsius for non-winter-irrigated land and -6.4 to 4.4 degrees Celsius for winter-irrigated land; the daily variation range was smaller for winter-irrigated land than for non-winter-irrigated land. Because the soil temperature of winter-irrigated land is higher, it can protect wheat from safe overwintering and prevent early spring late frost attacks. According to a survey in the People's Victory Canal irrigation area of Henan Province in 1955, the overwintering mortality rate of winter-irrigated wheat was 3.4%, while that of non-winter-irrigated wheat was 8.8%. In February 1955, the Han-Hui Canal irrigation area in Shaanxi Province was hit by a cold wave, and the frost damage rate of winter-irrigated wheat seedlings was 4.7%, while that of non-winter-irrigated wheat seedlings was 31.7%. Farmers in Hebei Province also have a saying, "Wet land doesn't freeze, dry land freezes to death." This fully demonstrates the significant effect of winter irrigation in preventing frost damage.

The soil temperature of cotton fields with winter irrigation is also higher than that of spring-irrigated fields, so spring sowing can be advanced, cotton seeds take root quickly, emerge early, and promote full and strong seedlings. According to observations in the Shijin Canal irrigation area of Hebei Province in 1956, the average soil temperature in the ten days before sowing on April 10 was 11 degrees Celsius for winter-irrigated land; for land irrigated in early spring on March 13, it was 10.5 degrees Celsius, which was 0.5 degrees Celsius lower than that of winter-irrigated land. According to a survey in the Lvcun Commune of Anyang City, Henan Province, on April 1, 1959, the soil temperature before sowing on winter-irrigated land was 11.1 degrees Celsius, which was 1.3 degrees Celsius higher than the soil temperature of land spring-irrigated in mid-March. Sowing was done on the same day, April 6th. The cotton emerged completely on the winter irrigated land by April 28th, and the spring irrigated land by May 3rd, a five day delay. The rate of missing plants was 4.3% in the winter irrigated land, which was 2.5% less than the spring irrigated land. The budding period was also three days earlier on the winter irrigated land, and the yield increased by 10%.

In addition, after winter irrigation, the freezing and thawing action changes the physical properties of the soil, promotes fertilizer decomposition, loosens the soil, increases soil aeration and aggregate structure, and improves soil fertility, which is beneficial to crop growth and development.

3. Reducing Pests and Diseases. After winter irrigation, the soil temperature increases, and the freezing effect is not conducive to the growth of certain pests. Wheat aphids and red spiders are major pests of wheat, and they are much less common or even absent in winter-irrigated land than in non-winter-irrigated land. At the same time, irrigation promotes wheat growth and development, enhancing resistance to diseases. According to a survey by the Weihui Canal Irrigation Experiment Station in Shaanxi Province in 1954, the incidence of wheat culm black powder disease in winter-irrigated wheat was 14.6%, while that in non-irrigated wheat was 18.54%.

4. Combining Winter Irrigation to Wash Away Saline-Alkali Soil and Improve the Soil. In saline-alkali areas, taking advantage of the low groundwater level and small evaporation rate in winter, combining winter irrigation with a larger amount of water can wash away the salt, allowing the salt in the topsoil to seep downward, which is beneficial to sowing in the coming spring.

In areas with strong winds and sand, the topsoil is easily blown away after autumn plowing due to strong winds. After winter irrigation, the topsoil freezes, which can prevent sand from being blown away by the wind.

5. Fully Utilizing Winter Water Volume, Easing the Contradiction of Insufficient Spring Irrigation Water Volume and Labor. If winter irrigation of wheat and cotton fields increases the moisture content by an average of 5% to 10% in the 0.5-meter-deep cultivated layer, each mu can store an additional 20 to 40 cubic meters of water; winter irrigation nationwide can store 5 billion to 10 billion cubic meters of water. In this way, winter irrigation can alleviate the tension of spring irrigation water to a certain extent, achieving the effect of expanding the irrigated area.

Technical Issues to Note in Winter Irrigation

Farmers in vast areas of North and Northwest China have traditionally had the habit of winter irrigation. Since the Great Leap Forward, with the development of water conservancy construction, the area of winter irrigation has greatly increased, winter irrigation areas have expanded from the north to the south, and winter irrigation objects have developed from wheat and white land to other crops, and irrigation technology has also greatly improved. The technical experience of winter irrigation in various places is summarized as follows: I. Winter Wheat Winter
Irrigation Techniques
Winter irrigation of wheat is carried out when the wheat seedlings are young and the weather is cold. When irrigating, attention should be paid to mastering the following aspects:

1. Irrigation Time. The time of winter irrigation of wheat depends on the climate, soil moisture, and wheat seedling growth. Generally, it starts in late October and stops after freezing makes it impossible to draw water, irrigating once or twice. The first irrigation is called "root consolidating water," and it is carried out around "Start of Winter," mainly to make up for the lack of soil moisture at the time of sowing; it can also compact the soil for deeply plowed land and prevent the phenomenon of "burning seedlings" for high-yield wheat fields with a large amount of fertilizer applied. The second irrigation is called "freezing water," and it is carried out around "Heavy Snow," and it is most suitable when the water can seep into the soil and freeze at night and thaw during the day. This winter irrigation should not be later than before the hard freeze, otherwise the water cannot seep into the soil after irrigation, which can easily cause the phenomenon of "ice heave" and root breakage, damaging wheat seedlings and causing yield reduction.

2. Irrigation Volume. The soil moisture content for wintering wheat growth should generally not be lower than 17%. Even if the soil moisture content is above 17%, winter irrigation still has a significant yield-increasing effect. The amount of winter irrigation water is determined by the soil texture, soil moisture content, and the depth of the groundwater level. The amount of irrigation can be smaller when the groundwater level is high and the underlying moisture is sufficient, otherwise, the amount of irrigation can be appropriately increased; sandy soil with weak water retention capacity should be irrigated more, while clay soil with strong water retention capacity can be irrigated less. The general irrigation quota is 50 to 70 cubic meters per mu, with a minimum of 30 to 40 cubic meters.

3. Irrigation Technique. With the full implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" of agriculture and the realization of high-yield plots and garden-like fields, small-furrow irrigation should be vigorously promoted. Before planting wheat, combine with land preparation to repair field projects and auxiliary buildings, and build furrows before and after planting wheat. The specifications of furrow fields are determined according to soil texture and ground slope; furrows should be long when the slope is large and the soil permeability is weak, and vice versa.

Reasonably controlling the flow into the furrow is an important aspect of improving irrigation technology. The single-width flow (flow entering per meter of furrow width) flowing into the furrow field should generally be controlled between 2-5 liters per second. It can be larger if the slope is gentle, the permeability is strong, and the furrow field is long, and vice versa. If the single-width flow is too large, it will scour the ground surface and damage wheat seedlings.

4. Cultivation Techniques Should Be Combined with Winter Irrigation. For wheat to undergo winter irrigation, other agricultural technical measures must be closely integrated with it to fully exert the effect of winter irrigation. If there is insufficient fertilizer, wheat seedlings will turn yellow after winter irrigation; it is best to topdress with farmyard manure once before or after irrigation. In order to prevent cracking and preserve soil moisture, if it has not frozen after irrigation, winter cultivation should be carried out once or twice, or harrowing and rolling.

II. Irrigation Techniques for Winter Irrigation of White Land

The main functions of winter irrigation in cotton fields and other white land for spring sowing are to store water and keep warm to ensure timely sowing in the coming spring. The time for winter irrigation of white land can be carried out after the previous crop is harvested until irrigation stops after freezing makes it impossible to draw water. The period when the water dissipates during the day and freezes at night after irrigation is the most suitable time for winter irrigation, which is conducive to preserving soil moisture. However, this period is not long, and there is a contradiction with the water used for winter irrigation of wheat. In order to strive to irrigate more land, winter irrigation of white land can be carried out earlier.

The amount of water for winter irrigation of white land should be larger, generally about 60 to 100 cubic meters per mu. The quota can be appropriately reduced for clay land with strong water retention capacity, high groundwater level, and high soil moisture. For saline-alkali land, in order to suppress alkali and wash salt, the quota can be greater than 100 cubic meters, but attention must be paid to drainage outlets to avoid causing a sharp rise in groundwater. The furrow irrigation method can be used for the irrigation method, and small furrow irrigation can also be used in well irrigation areas.

The close combination of winter irrigation of white land and agricultural cultivation techniques is a very important issue. For white land that is winter-irrigated early, it should be harrowed immediately after irrigation to preserve soil moisture; for white land that is winter-irrigated late, it is necessary to seize favorable opportunities in the coming spring and carry out "topsoil" harrowing after thawing about one Chinese inch to prevent moisture from dissipating.

For winter irrigation of white land, it is best to apply base fertilizer first, carry out winter plowing, and then irrigate.

    把春旱消灭在冬天
    胡梅生　邹广荣
    编者按：冬灌是预防春旱，争取小麦丰产和春播作物适时播种的一项重要措施。今年我国又发生了严重的旱情，不少地区一、二百天未下透雨，小麦、棉花和其它作物生长受到很大影响。明年是否还会发生类似旱象？为了防患于未然，今冬大力推行冬灌，提高土壤的含水率，是十分重要的措施。力争把春旱消灭在今冬，这是我们在农业生产上争取主动权的重要方面。
    冬灌，是在冬季结冻前后对越冬作物和春播白地进行的储水灌溉。它是争取夏收作物特别是冬小麦丰产和棉花适时播种的重要措施，也是预防春旱、战胜春旱的有效方法。从我国气候特点来看，除个别地区春季多雨外，大部地区都是冬春少雨，特别是华北和西北地区，平均年降雨量仅三百到六百毫米，冬春降雨只约占10％左右。但是，冬小麦这时期的需水量，一般超过降雨量数倍。所以，春季干旱严重威胁着小麦生长和春播作物的适时播种。生产实践证明，大搞冬灌，就可以在很大程度上战胜春旱威胁。河北、河南、山东、陕西等省农民，把小麦冬灌称作“盘根水”，意思就是小麦冬灌，可以促进根系的发育和分蘖；有的还说，“棉花要全苗，冬灌不可少”，这也是说棉田冬灌，是保证苗全苗齐的重要关键。
    冬灌对增产的效果非常显著。据北方典型地区调查，在其他条件相同的情况下，冬灌过的小麦比不冬灌的一般增产5％到10％，最高有达20％到30％以上；棉花增产3％到15％。
      冬灌的几种作用
    根据各地对冬灌的调查和试验观测，归纳起来，冬灌有以下几个作用：
    1、储水保墒，预防春旱。冬灌过的土地，经耙耱、松土、镇压等保墒措施，到来春，土壤含水率较不冬灌的高5％到8％。据河北省石津渠灌区1953年至1957年的试验观测，小麦于11月中旬进行冬灌，灌前结合灌水施厩肥一次，灌后七至八天进行疏松表土镇压，来年解冻前后进行“顶凌”耙耱，小麦返青时的土壤水分，均保持在20％到26％以上，基本上可以满足返青用水。不冬灌的麦地，虽然采取同样保墒措施，土壤水分低于14％，小麦生长因水分不足受到一定抑制。又据山东高唐县1958年棉田进行储水灌溉的调查，12月上中旬进行冬灌后，在冬季进行二到三次耙耱保墒，至次年4月上旬播种时，土壤水分达15.25％，未冬灌的地只有7.9％，低于棉花播种适宜的含水率
  （12％到15％）。所以，冬灌不仅保证了越冬作物小麦等冬季和早春的需水，做到安全越冬和提早返青；也使棉田能有适宜的水分，便于适时下种和出苗。
    2、调节土壤温度，防止冻害，疏松土壤。冬灌与不冬灌，由于土壤水分的不同，水的容热量大于土的容热量，致使土壤温度的变化，产生很大差异。水分多的土壤温度，在整个冬季，都较水分少的土壤为高，日变化幅度也较为平稳。据河北省农业科学院1955年在石津渠灌区的试验观测，在1954年11月至1955年2月期间，冬灌的麦田土壤温度较不冬灌的平均高摄氏零点二度到一点七度。日变化幅度也较小，1月15日七至二十一时，表层十厘米深度的土壤温度变化，不冬灌的为零下七点七度到五点五度，冬灌的则为零下六点四度到四点四度；日变化幅度冬灌的比不冬灌的较小。由于冬灌过的土地地温较高，故能保护小麦安全越冬和防止早春晚霜侵袭。据河南人民胜利渠灌区1955年调查，冬灌的小麦越冬死亡率为3.4％，不冬灌的为8.8％。陕西汉惠渠灌区1955年2月受到一次寒流侵袭，冬灌的麦苗受冻率为4.7％，未冬灌的为31.7％。河北省农民也流传着“湿不冻，干冻死”的农谚。这都充分说明了冬灌对防止冻害有显著作用。
    棉田冬灌较春灌的地温也高，因而可以提早春播，棉籽扎根快，出苗早，并能促使苗全苗壮。据河北石津渠灌区1956年观测，4月10日播前十天内土壤温度，冬灌的平均为十一度；3月13日进行早春灌的则为十度半，较冬灌的低零点五度。又据河南安阳市吕村公社1959年4月1日调查，冬灌地播前地温为十一点一度，比在3月中旬进行春灌的地温高一点三度。同在4月6日播种，冬灌地4月28日齐苗，春灌地在5月3日齐苗，推迟五天。冬灌地缺苗率占4.3％，比春灌地缺苗率少2.5％；现蕾期也比春灌地早三天，增产10％。
    此外，冬灌后经过冻消作用，改变了土壤的物理性，促使肥料分解、土壤疏松，增加土壤的通气和团粒结构，提高土壤的肥力，有利于作物的生长发育。
    3、减轻病虫害。冬灌后，土壤温度增长，加上冰冻影响，不利于某些害虫的生长。麦蚜虫和红蜘蛛，是为害小麦很大的害虫，冬灌地比不冬灌的就少得多，甚至没有。同时，由于灌溉促进小麦的生长发育，增强对病害的抵抗力。根据陕西渭惠渠灌溉试验站1954年的调查，冬灌的小麦秆，黑粉病发病率为14.6％，未灌的为18.54％。
    4、结合冬灌，冲洗盐碱土，改良土壤。在盐碱地区，利用冬季地下水位低、蒸发量小的有利条件，结合冬灌，采用较大定额的灌水，可以冲洗压盐，使表土盐分下渗，有利于来春播种。
    风沙多的地区，在秋耕后，因风力大，容易吹走表土。冬灌以后，表土冻结，可防止沙土被风吹走。
    5、充分利用冬季水量，缓和春灌水量和劳力不足的矛盾。冬灌麦田和棉田，按零点五米深耕作层，平均增加水分5％到10％计算，每亩可增储水量二十到四十立方米；全国冬灌储水，就可达到五十亿至一百亿立方米。这样，冬灌在一定程度上可以缓和春灌用水紧张局面，达到扩大灌溉面积的作用。
  冬灌应注意的技术问题
    我国华北、西北等广大地区的农民，历来就有冬灌习惯。大跃进以来，随着水利建设事业的发展，冬灌面积大大增加，冬灌地区由北方发展到南方，冬灌对象由小麦、白地发展到其它作物，灌水技术也有很大提高。现将各地冬灌技术经验，归纳如下：一、冬小麦冬
    灌的灌水技术
    小麦冬灌，是在麦苗幼小、天气寒冷的情况下进行的。灌溉时，应注意掌握以下环节：
    1、灌水时间。小麦冬灌时间，取决于气候、土壤水分和麦苗生长情况，一般是10月下旬开始，至封冻后无法引水时停止，灌溉一至二次。第一次称为“盘根水”，在“立冬”前后进行，灌这一水，主要是弥补播种时土壤水分不足；对深翻的土地还可使土壤塌实，对于大量施用肥料的丰产麦田可以防止“烧苗”现象发生。第二次称为“封冻水”，在“大雪”前后进行，以灌后水能渗入土中，日消夜冻最为适宜。这次冬灌，最迟不宜超过上大冻以前，否则灌后水不能渗入土中，容易产生“凌抬”断根现象，伤害麦苗，造成减产。
    2、灌水量。小麦越冬生长，土壤含水率一般不宜低于17％。即使土壤含水率在17％以上，进行冬灌，仍有显著增产作用。冬灌水量大小，根据土质、土壤含水率、地下水位深浅等情况决定。地下水位高、底墒足的，灌水量可以小些，反之，灌水量可以适当加大；砂性土质、保水能力弱的多灌些，粘性土、保水能力强的则可少灌些。一般灌水定额每亩五十至七十立方米，少的三十至四十立方米。
    3、灌水技术。随着农业“八字宪法”的全面贯彻，丰产方、园田化的实现，要大力推行小畦灌溉。在种麦之前，结合整地，把田间工程及附属建筑物修好，种麦前后，把畦子打好。畦田规格，根据土质、地面坡度而定，坡度大、土壤透水性弱的，畦田宜长，反之，畦田宜短。
    合理掌握入畦流量，是提高灌水技术的重要环节。流入畦田的单宽流量（每米畦宽进入的流量）一般掌握在二——五每秒升之间为宜，坡度平缓、透水性强、畦田长的，可以大些，反之则宜小些。单宽流量如过大，会冲刷地表，伤毁麦苗。
    4、耕作技术要和冬灌相结合。小麦进行冬灌，其它农业技术措施必须和它紧密结合，才能充分发挥冬灌作用。如果肥料不足，冬灌后会产生麦苗发黄现象；灌水前或灌水后，最好能追施一次厩肥。为了防止龟裂，保住地墒，如灌后尚未上冻，应进行一到二次冬锄，或耙耱、镇压。
    二、白地冬灌的灌水技术
    棉田和其它春播白地，冬灌作用主要是储水保温，保证来春及时播种。白地冬灌时间，在前作收获以后，即可进行，直至封冻后不能引水时停止。灌后日消夜冻的时期是冬灌最为适宜的时候，这时期灌水利于保墒。但这段时间不长，又和小麦冬灌用水有矛盾，为了争取多浇一些地，白地冬灌可以提前进行。
    白地冬灌的水量要大些，一般约每亩六十到一百立方米。粘土地，保水能力强，地下水位高，土壤湿度大的，定额可以适当减少。盐碱地为了压碱洗盐，定额可大于一百立方米，但须注意排水出路，以免引起地下水剧烈上升。灌水方法可采用畦灌法，井灌区还可采用小畦灌。
    白地冬灌和农业耕作技术密切结合，是一个十分重要的问题。早冬灌的白地，灌后要立即耙耱保墒；晚冬灌的，次年开春后要抓住有利时机，在开冻后约一市寸左右、进行“顶凌”耙耱，防止水分散发。
    白地冬灌，最好先施上底肥，进行冬耕，然后灌水。
