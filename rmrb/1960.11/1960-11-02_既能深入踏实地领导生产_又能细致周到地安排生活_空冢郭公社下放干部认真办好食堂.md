    Not only Deeply and Practically Leading Production, but also Meticulously and Thoughtfully Arranging Life
    Cadres Transferred to Kongzhongguo Commune Diligently Manage Canteens
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Cadres transferred from Luohe City, Henan Province, to the Kongzhongguo People's Commune, due to their arduous efforts, leading by example, and providing meticulous care for the lives of commune members, have helped commune members run canteens well according to the needs of the masses. This has greatly changed the living conditions of the commune members, stimulated their enthusiasm for labor and drive, and also greatly tempered themselves.
    A prominent problem existing in some production teams in the Kongzhongguo People's Commune was the need to strengthen canteen work. Starting in February of this year, the Municipal Party Committee has successively transferred seventy-three cadres here, including three department heads and four-fifths Party members, most of whom are excellent cadres capable of independent work. Based on the specific situation of the Kongzhongguo People's Commune and the demands of the masses, the Municipal Party Committee instructed this group of cadres to start by focusing on improving the lives of commune members and running the canteens well, thereby driving production.
    Chen Xiude, member of the Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee and Minister of the Organization Department, and Zhang Sutang, Minister of the Rural Work Department (serving as the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee), first led the Commune Party Committee to convene five meetings to specifically study the living problems of the masses. Combining the instructions and documents of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on caring for the lives of the masses, they further clarified the relationship between life and production, and educated all Party members and cadres in the commune on the necessity of earnestly organizing the lives of the masses. Then, they organized a commune member life investigation team of more than 100 people, including the transferred cadres, to conduct detailed and thorough investigations into all aspects of the lives of the commune members, so that the transferred cadres had a clear understanding of the urgent demands of the commune members regarding their lives and their opinions on the canteens. They also organized publicity efforts to educate the commune members on thrift and economy, planned use of grain, and long-term management. During the wheat harvest, commune members across the commune changed their past practice of not holding back and eating everything after the harvest, so that each production team saved tens of thousands of catties of wheat from their rations to improve their lives and for the next summer harvest. As soon as the weather turned cold, Chen Xiude, Zhang Sutang, and others immediately organized forces to specifically help major brigades solve the problems of cotton clothes, cotton shoes, heating fuel, and canteen heating equipment for the commune members as early as possible. Recently, the Commune Party Committee accepted the opinions of the transferred cadres in the production teams and organized commune members to visit and inspect the canteen "warehouses" to understand the grain, coal, oil, salt, dried vegetables, and winter equipment stored in the canteens. The results of the visit and inspection showed that in more than 60% of the canteens in the commune, in addition to the rations reserved by the state according to the standard, coal, salt, vegetables, etc. were all stored and arranged until the next wheat harvest, and the remaining canteens had also been arranged until spring. This made the commune members very relieved and satisfied during the tense three autumn harvests.
    Because the cadres cared for the lives of the masses meticulously, the commune members trusted the cadres very much. The Communist Party members transferred to the command post brigade to manage food, stipulated in seven canteens: even if the commune members have only a few steamed buns left over from the previous meal, they must be counted accurately, put in the pot for the next meal, and let the commune members eat them equally. Although this was a small matter, it moved the commune members to say: "Now we can rest assured that we will eat exactly as much as the country leaves for us." Cai Songlin, from the Municipal Party Committee Office, who was transferred to the No. 2 production team of the Wangguan Brigade as deputy secretary, used all his spare time to personally lead the commune members to sweep leaves and broken firewood, so that each household stored fifty to eighty catties of dry firewood for heating in winter, and thus promoted the entire brigade to arrange the commune members' winter preparations earlier. The commune members said that the branch cares for the commune members especially thoughtfully this year.
    Dozens of cadres transferred to the Kongzhongguo People's Commune were extremely considerate to the lives and sufferings of the commune members and established close ties with the masses. In many cases, the homes of the transferred cadres gathered some commune members every night to talk about their daily lives and reflect various problems, so that the cadres could understand the commune members' opinions on the canteens in a timely manner and solve many of their living problems.
    This group of cadres transferred to the Kongzhongguo People's Commune, with their exemplary behavior and meticulous care for the commune members, influenced the grassroots cadres below and also moved the broad masses of commune members. Many grassroots cadres proposed to learn from them. In the past, because some brigade cadres did not realize the importance of canteen work, they arranged people with poor performance to work in the canteens, which affected the lives of the commune members. Now, they have selected people who are of good background, work well, and are recognized by the commune members as selfless to be the "housekeepers" of the canteens.

    既能深入踏实地领导生产  又能细致周到地安排生活
    空冢郭公社下放干部认真办好食堂
    本报讯　河南省漯河市下放到空冢郭人民公社的干部，由于艰苦深入，以身作则，无微不至地关怀社员生活，根据群众需要，帮助社员办好食堂，使社员的生活面貌有了极大的改变，既激发了社员的劳动热情和干劲，也很好地锻炼了自己。
    空冢郭人民公社一部分生产队原来存在的一个突出问题是食堂工作需要加强。市委从今年2月开始，即已陆续下放到这里七十三名干部，其中三位部长，五分之四的党员，大都是能独立工作的优秀干部。市委根据空冢郭人民公社的具体情况和群众的要求，指示这批干部首先从抓好社员生活，办好食堂入手，带动生产。
    下放到这里的市委常委、组织部部长陈秀德、农村工作部部长张素堂（担任公社党委第一书记）等，首先领导公社党委召开了五次会议，专门研究群众的生活问题，他们结合党中央、毛主席关于关心群众生活的一些指示、文件，进一步明确了生活和生产的关系，向全社共产党员和干部进行了必须认真组织好群众生活的教育，然后，组织了包括下放干部在内的一百多人的社员生活调查团深入生产小队和住户，对社员生活的各方面进行细致周密的调查，使下放干部对社员生活的迫切要求，对食堂的意见等了如指掌。并组织了宣传力量，在社员中进行勤俭节约、计划用粮、细水长流的教育。麦收期间，全社社员改变了过去不留后手，打完吃光的做法，使每个生产队都从口粮中节余几万斤小麦，以备改善生活和明年夏忙之用。天刚冷时，陈秀德、张素堂等立即组织力量，具体帮助各大队提早解决社员的棉衣、棉鞋、烤火燃料及食堂保暖设备等问题。最近，公社党委接受生产队下放干部的意见，组织社员参观和检查食堂“仓库”，了解食堂储存的粮、煤、油、盐、干菜和过冬设备等。参观检查结果，全社60％以上的食堂，除国家按标准留够的口粮外，煤、盐、菜等都储存安排到明年麦收，其余的食堂也已安排到春天。这使社员在紧张的三秋生产中，十分放心、满意。
    由于干部无微不至地关心群众生活，社员对干部十分信任。下放到指挥砦大队管伙食的共产党员们，在七个食堂规定：社员们上顿吃剩下的那怕是几个馍，也要如数数好，下顿放在锅里，让社员均吃，这虽是小事，却使社员感动地说：“这下子放心了，国家留给咱多少，就不折不扣的吃足多少”。下放到王官大队第二生产小队任副支书的市委办公室的蔡松林，利用一切空闲时间，亲自带领社员扫树叶，扫碎柴，使每家都储存五十斤到八十斤干柴，以备冬天烤火，并因此推动了整个大队提早安排社员的过冬准备，社员们都说今年支部关心社员特别周到。
    下放到空冢郭人民公社的几十名干部，对社员的生活和疾苦体贴备至，和群众建立了密切的联系。有不少下放干部的住屋，每天晚上聚拢一些社员谈家常，反映各种问题，使干部及时了解社员对食堂的意见，解决了许多社员的生活问题。
    下放到空冢郭人民公社的这批干部，以自己的模范行为和对社员的百般体贴，影响了下边的基层干部，也感动了广大社员，不少基层干部提出向他们学习。过去，由于一些大队干部，没有认识到食堂工作的重要，把表现不好的人安排到食堂做工作，影响了社员的生活。现在，都把成份好、劳动好、社员公认为大公无私的人，选到食堂“管家”。
