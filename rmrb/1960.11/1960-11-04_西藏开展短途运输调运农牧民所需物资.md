Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Electric Dispatch: Tibet is vigorously organizing civilian animal power and various means of transportation to rapidly transfer the means of production and livelihood materials needed by farmers and herdsmen after the bumper harvest to various places.

In the past three months, approximately 200,000 livestock have been put into transportation between prefectures and counties/districts in Tibet. Horse carts, handcarts, and yak skin boats have also been organized to participate in transportation, enabling the timely exchange of animal products and salt produced in large quantities in the northern pastoral areas, and the grain harvested in the southern agricultural areas. Various industrial products have also been quickly allocated to rural areas and pastures. In September alone, the Naqu Prefecture and Dangxiong County and other pastoral areas transported three million catties of salt and a large number of animal products to Lhasa and nearby agricultural areas, and transported back large quantities of grain and daily necessities. In the third quarter, the state-owned Lhasa City Trading Company transferred materials to Mozhugongka, Qushui, Linzhou, Dangxiong and other counties, with the transfer volume increasing seven times compared with the same period last year. At the same time, it also transported a large number of local animal products to Lhasa. Among them, Dangxiong County alone transported back more than 40 kinds of local specialties such as medicinal materials and leather, worth more than 100,000 yuan.

This year, Tibet's agriculture, animal husbandry and special local product production have all achieved bumper harvests, and the income of the Tibetan people has generally increased. Their purchasing power exceeds any previous year, and the industrial products prepared by the state-owned trade departments for them are about four times that of last year. Due to the sufficient preparation and timely transfer of materials, the state-owned trade departments in various parts of Tibet have now basically prepared the materials needed by farmers and herdsmen after autumn. Jiali County, a pastoral area surrounded by high mountains, has very inconvenient transportation. In the past, herdsmen often could not buy things due to snow blocking the mountains. Now, due to the vigorous development of animal power transportation, it has now stocked up on the materials needed by the people of the county for this winter and next spring.

    西藏开展短途运输调运农牧民所需物资
    新华社拉萨电  西藏各地大力组织民间畜力和各种运输工具，把农牧民在丰收后所需要的生产资料和生活资料迅速调运到各地。
    近三个月来，西藏各专区与县、区之间，投入运输的牲畜约有二十万头，马车、手推车和牛皮船也已组织起来参加运输，使北部牧区大量出产的畜产品和食盐，南部农业区丰收的粮食，及时得到了交换；各种工业品也迅速调拨到了农村、牧场。在9月份中，仅那曲专区和当雄县等牧区就运送了三百万斤食盐与大量畜产品到拉萨和附近的农区，并运回了大批粮食和日用品。国营拉萨市贸易公司在第三季度里，向墨竹工卡、曲水、林周、当雄等县调运的物资，比去年同期的调运量增加了七倍，同时还把大量土畜产品运到了拉萨。其中仅当雄县运回的药材、皮张等土特产品就有四十多种，价值十万多元。
    今年西藏农牧业和土特产生产都获得丰收，藏族人民的收入普遍增加，购买力超过以往任何一年，国营贸易部门为他们准备的工业品约相当于去年的四倍。由于物资准备充分和调运及时，目前西藏各地国营贸易部门都已基本上备齐了农牧民在秋后所需要的物资。被高山环抱的牧区嘉黎县，交通十分不便，过去牧民常常因为雪封山而买不到东西，现在由于大搞畜力运输，目前已备足了全县人民今冬明春所需要的物资。
