Xinhua News Agency, 24th: From the 21st to the 24th, snowfall was widespread in areas north of the Yellow River basin, and rainfall was widespread in areas south of the Yellow River basin and north of the Nanling Mountains. Currently, rain or snow continues to fall in areas south of the Yellow River basin and north of the Yangtze River basin.

According to a reporter's understanding from the Central Meteorological Bureau, this rainfall and snowfall is beneficial to agricultural production in various regions. The Minor Snow solar term has passed, and it is a great time for winter irrigation in North China. This snowfall is equivalent to a widespread winter irrigation for these areas, preparing sufficient soil moisture for wheat to overwinter. The rainfall in areas south of the Yellow River is also conducive to wheat tillering, and is beneficial to the sowing and emergence of winter wheat in the Yangtze River basin, as well as the transplanting of rapeseed and the growth and development of green manure crops.

The Central Meteorological Bureau said that after the rain and snow stop, all regions should pay attention to storing water and preserving soil moisture; especially the provinces in North China, which should take active measures to prevent spring drought next year. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River may experience excessive rainfall, and attention should be paid to digging ditches for drainage.

    黄河南北普遍降雨降雪
    据新华社24日讯　从21日到24日，黄河流域以北地区普遍降雪，黄河流域以南、南岭山地以北广大地区普遍降雨。目前，黄河流域以南、长江流域以北地区仍在继续下雨或下雪。
    据记者从中央气象局了解，这次降雨、降雪对各地农业生产都有好处。目前小雪已过，正是华北地区冬灌的大好时机，这次降雪等于为这些地区普遍进行了一次冬灌，为小麦越冬准备了底墒。黄河以南地区的降雨，也有利于小麦分蘖生长，对长江流域冬小麦播种、出苗，油菜移栽和绿肥作物生长发育也有好处。
    中央气象局说，雨雪停止以后，各地要注意蓄水保墒；尤其是华北各省，更应采取积极措施，以防明年春旱。长江中、下游地区可能雨水过多，应注意开沟排水。
