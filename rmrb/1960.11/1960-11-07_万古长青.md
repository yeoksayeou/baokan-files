    If someone asked me what the most profound impression I gained during my travels in the Soviet Union was, I would not hesitate to answer: friendship. – The friendship between Chinese and Soviet people, and between Soviet and Chinese people. This friendship not only connects the past, but also extends to the future. Many workers, students, collective farm members, and other ordinary Soviet people have said to me more than once: "Dear Chinese comrades, we have similar struggles and consistent goals. We work together to deal with imperialism. The unity of China and the Soviet Union is a bastion of world peace."
    Without any need for explanation, I completely share the same feelings as my Soviet comrades.
    I remember a small story.
    One Sunday in May, I came out of the Central Lenin Museum and walked slowly towards Red Square. In my mind, new displays began to appear: the leaflets drafted by Lenin, the first issue of *Iskra*, the underground printing house in Baku, the guardhouse in Siberia, and especially the friendship that this proletarian revolutionary teacher and his comrades continuously sowed and cultivated during those difficult years, one after another triggering my deep thoughts. The sunlight shone on me, the coldness of Moscow had subsided, and the entire city was covered with a transparent color. People walked busily, occasionally giving me kind smiles. This intimate feeling fermented in my blood. I didn't know any of the passersby, yet every one of them seemed familiar. I understood them. Back in the early 1930s, when Lenin's works were being introduced to China more extensively, through these works, I learned what kind of education the Soviet people had received and what kind of training they had undergone. I also further encountered the lives of Soviet people and glimpsed the activities of their inner world from the works of Gorky, Fadeyev, and Ostrovsky. Understanding is the fertile soil for cultivating friendship. In the past, writers could only depict the friendship between individuals: David and Jonathan, Hercules and Iolaus; or, like Bacon, write a special essay: "A man that hath no friend, and that upon this severance, doth make his resorts to others, is a mere straw." (Bacon, *Of Friendship*). No! According to our point of view, if a person has only one true friend, then the world for him will still be a desert island.
    We don't want desert islands, we have true friends everywhere.
    This is how I understand the Soviet people I met. When the Soviet comrades gave me kind smiles, weren't they treating me as the Chinese people in their minds, according to their own understanding?
    – This is the starting point of our friendship, we have a common ideological foundation.
    As I thought, I sat down on a step at the entrance of Red Square. From here, I could see the silhouette of the Lenin Stalin Mausoleum. Behind the mausoleum, under a batch of lush trees, their comrades lay quietly, just as I had seen in the museum, those heroes who had always been with the masses, bravely and wisely writing the history of the Soviets with their lives: Sverdlov, Dzerzhinsky, Ordzhonikidze, Frunze, Kirov, and Zhdanov.
    I gazed and continued my deep contemplation.
    Since the salvo of the October Revolution, history has put our two countries on the same track, and every victory of the Soviet Union is a support for China. The actions of these heroes have moved us. When our comrades were suffering torture in dark prisons, fighting in damp mountain gullies, or sacrificing their lives at the last moment on the execution ground, they couldn't help but think of Lenin, of the cause Lenin had created with his own hands. They drew encouragement from this friendship and saw their own strength.
    Like the huge and rapid screech of brakes often heard during a car accident, I was startled awake. A car stopped beside me. The driver was a tall young man, he quickly opened the car door and pounced on me like a tiger. He asked in fluent Chinese:
    "Are you Chinese?"
    I stood up in fear, inwardly shouting that this time I had disgraced the Chinese. As I nodded, and was about to apologize to him according to my guess, blaming myself for sitting here and possibly hindering his driving, the young man held me down, sat next to my shoulder, and held my hand affectionately, saying:
    "That's right, you are a Chinese comrade. I've been to Dalian, I stayed there for three years. I like China, I like the Chinese. I just received a letter from Little Wu three days ago, do you know Little Wu? A great welder. I have to reply to him immediately. I have many friends there, many Chinese friends."
    I stared at him, his light blue eyes also had a hint of kind smile, looking no more than twenty-four or five years old. Incommensurate with his tall stature, his rosy face still retained a bit of childishness. I dared not tell him that I had never been to Dalian, I said Dalian was a good place.
    "A good place." The young man fell into memories, and said in a low voice filled with dreamy expressions: "Too beautiful! If it weren't for the job transfer, I wouldn't want to come back?"
    "Are you also a welder?"
    "No! I'm a fitter. My whole family does this. My dad's craftsmanship is excellent. He's old now, so he stays in Tbilisi to train apprentices. He personally taught me and my two older brothers, who are all seventh-grade workers. Hmm, you don't blame me for being too rash just now? I go crazy when I see Chinese people! This is also what my dad taught me. I learned to love the Chinese since I was a child. My dad always praised you, saying the Chinese are brave, hardworking, and intelligent... Of course, I've been to China, so there's my own judgment in it."
    Speaking of the last sentence, the young fitter glanced at me, and laughed with a slight shyness.
    "Your dad hasn't been to China?"
    "No." The fitter comrade said regretfully, "I brought him Chinese shoes from Dalian, hand-knitted sweaters, portraits of Chinese leaders and construction pictures. He cherishes the sweaters and shoes and keeps them for festivals, only the portraits of leaders and construction pictures are hung on the wall, covering the whole room with colorful images."
    I listened absentmindedly, and a question came to my mind.
    "Do you think this is news? No!" The young fitter said decisively, "There is an old history here, my dad has reason to love the Chinese. After the October Revolution, almost all the Chinese workers who were originally in the Caucasus joined the Red Guards. When the August Incident occurred, the White bandits occupied Vladikavkaz, and the Cossacks burned down our village in one fell swoop. The Red Guard team that came to meet us was a platoon, and more than forty of the sixty-odd people in the entire platoon were Chinese. My dad joined the Red Guards from that time on. The Chinese comrades helped us in the revolution, fought with us, and shed blood together. They were very brave in battle. My dad said that the enemies would kill the Chinese comrades as soon as they caught them, but in the entire Caucasus, no Chinese comrade was ever heard to have surrendered to the White bandits. They showed infinite loyalty to the revolution."
    The young man spoke so seriously that he completely changed his original appearance. I interjected during the interval:
    "This is still news to me, a very important news."
    "My dad has been with the Chinese comrades in the Red Guards. The Chinese comrades have a high class consciousness and are very alert, so the Red Army commanders often transferred them to guard duties. Lenin had Chinese guards." The young man looked towards Red Square, and continued, "From that time on, my dad loved the Chinese from the bottom of his heart. He taught us three brothers this way: Never forget that for the revolution, the Chinese shed blood with your dad."
    The fitter comrade looked at his watch, stood up and said: "I have to go. Believe me, I love the Chinese more than my dad. We fought together, and we will continue to fight together. Please convey my greetings to all the Chinese comrades, and if possible, also to Little Wu. I have already told him: No force can destroy our friendship, this is revolutionary friendship!"
    He got into the car, waved his hand, and sped away like a gust of wind.
    "Yes, this is revolutionary friendship." I murmured to myself.
    The chimes of the Kremlin rang. People getting off work flocked to the streets, and Red Square was noisy, with countless kind smiles directed at me. Now I understand even more: why the eighty-year-old Armenian poet insisted on receiving us while ill, toasting with us, dancing with us, and not leaving until two o'clock late at night; why the workers of the Leningrad Bread Factory arranged the most lively scene to welcome us, and asked us to try every product in the factory; why the elementary school students in Stalingrad came to see us at the hotel every day after school, and gave us all their personal collections – photos, stamps, badges – when we parted, what a solemn and precious gift this should be in their young hearts! Is this merely an ordinary friendship?
    No! This is revolutionary friendship! Our friendship is rooted in a common ideological foundation, and no one can destroy such friendship. May revolutionary friendship last forever!

    如果有人问我在苏联旅行的日子里我所得到的最深刻的印象是什么，我将毫不迟疑地回答：友谊。——中国人和苏联人之间、苏联人和中国人之间的友谊。这种友谊不仅联系着过去，同时也伸展到未来。许多工人、学生、集体农庄庄员和别的普通苏联人，他们不止一次地向我说过：“亲爱的中国同志，我们有相似的斗争经历，我们有一致的追求目标，我们齐心协力地对付帝国主义，中苏两国的团结是世界和平的堡垒。”
    不需要任何说明，我完全怀着和苏联同志们同样的感情。
    我记起了一件小小的故事。
    5月的一个星期天，我从中央列宁博物馆出来，缓步地走向红场。脑海里开始了新的陈列：列宁起草的传单，《火星报》第一期，巴库的地下印刷所，西伯利亚的戍屋，特别是这位无产阶级革命导师和他的战友们在艰苦的年月里不断地播种开来的友谊，一件接着一件地引起我的深思。阳光照到身上，莫斯科的寒意已经消退了，整个城市蒙上一层透明的色彩。人们忙忙碌碌地走着，不时投给我以善意的微笑。这种亲切的感情在我的血液里发酵，我并不认识任何一个行路人，然而任何一个行路人看来似乎都很熟悉，我了解他们。远在三十年代初期，当列宁的著作较多地被介绍到中国的时候，通过这些著作，我知道苏联人接受了什么样的教育，经历过哪一类的锻炼。我还从高尔基、法捷耶夫、奥斯特洛夫斯基的作品里，进一步接触到苏联人的生活，窥见了他们内心世界的活动。了解是培育友谊的沃土。往昔的文人们只能渲染个人之间的友情：大卫与约纳丹，海格列斯与依奥伦斯；或者如培根那样写成专文：“一个人如果没有一个真实的朋友，世界对于他将是一个荒岛。”（培根：《论友谊》）不！根据我们的观点，如果一个人只有一个真实的朋友，那末，世界对于他仍然将是一个荒岛。
    我们不要荒岛，到处有我们真实的朋友。
    我这样来理解我所遇见的苏联人。当苏联同志们投给我以善意的微笑的时候，难道不是按照自己的理解，把我作为他们心目中的中国人来看待吗？
    ——这就是我们友谊的出发点，我们有一个共同的思想基础。
    我一面想，一面在红场入口处的一个台阶上坐下来。从这里，望得见列宁斯大林陵墓的侧影，陵墓后面，一批葱绿的树荫下，静静地躺着他们的战友，正如刚才在博物馆里看到的，那些始终和群众一起，以自己的生命勇敢而又智慧地写出了苏维埃历史的英雄：斯维德洛夫、捷尔任斯基、奥尔忠尼启则、伏龙芝、基洛夫和日丹诺夫。
    我眺望着，继续着我的沉思默想。
    自从十月革命一声炮响，历史把我们两国纳入一条轨道，苏联的每一个胜利都是对中国的支持。这些英雄们的行为感动过我们。当我们的同志在阴暗的监狱里熬受苦刑，在潮湿的山沟里进行搏斗，或者在刑场上最后牺牲生命的一刹那间，他们会情不自禁地想起列宁，想起列宁亲手缔造的事业。他们从这里吸取友谊的鼓舞，看到了自己的力量。
    像车祸发生时经常可以听到的一个巨大而急促的煞车声把我惊醒，一辆汽车在我身旁停下。司机是一个个儿高大的小伙子，他迅速地打开车门，像猛虎一样扑向我。用流利的中国话问：
    “你是中国人吗？”
    我惶恐地站起身，心里直叫糟糕，这回可给中国人丢了脸。当我一面点头，一面正要按照猜测向他道歉，责备自己不该坐到这儿，以致可能妨碍他的行车的时候，小伙子一把按定我，挨着我的肩膀坐下，亲密地拉住手说：
    “一点不错，你是中国同志。我到过大连，在那儿耽了三年。我喜欢中国，我喜欢中国人。三天前刚接到小吴来信，你认识小吴吗？一个挺棒的电焊工人。我得马上给他回信。我在那儿有许多朋友，许多中国朋友。”
    我望定他，他的浅蓝色的眼睛里同样有一丝善意的微笑，看上去顶多不过二十四五岁。和他高大的个儿不相称，红润的脸上还留着一点稚气。我不敢告诉他我没到过大连，我说大连是个好地方。
    “好地方。”小伙子落入了回忆，充满着梦幻的神情低低地说：“太美了！要不是调动工作，我还不想回来呢？”
    “你也是电焊工吗？”
    “不！我是个钳工。我们一家都干这个。我爹的手艺才出色哩，如今年岁高了，留在梯弗里斯带徒弟，他亲自教我和两个哥哥，他们都是七级工。嗯，你不怪我刚才太莽撞吗？一见到中国人我就疯啦！这也是我爹教的。我从小就学会爱中国人，我爹总是啧啧地称道你们，说中国人勇敢，刻苦，聪明……当然，我到过中国，这里面还有我自己的判断。”
    说到最后一句，年轻的钳工瞟了我一眼，带着一点轻微的羞涩笑了起来。
      “你爹没到过中国吗？”
      “没有。”钳工同志抱憾地说，
  “我从大连给他捎来了中国鞋，手工打的毛衣，中国的领袖像和建设图片，他把毛衣和鞋宝贝似的收藏起来，不到节日不穿上身，只有领袖像和建设图片挂在墙上，花花绿绿的贴满一屋子。”
    我出神地听着，心里想起了一个问题。
    “你觉得这是一个新闻吗？不！”年轻的钳工斩钉截铁地说，“这里有一段古老的历史，我爹有理由爱中国人。十月革命后，原来在高加索的中国工人几乎全部投入了赤卫队。八月事件发生时，白匪占领了符拉基卡夫卡兹，哥萨克一把火烧掉了我们的村子，来接应的赤卫队是一个排，全排六十几个人里倒有四十几个是中国人，我爹从那时候起就加入了赤卫队。中国同志们帮助我们革命，和我们一起作战，一起流血。他们打起仗来可勇敢哩。我爹说，敌人一抓到中国同志就杀，可是在整个高加索，没听说一个中国同志投降过白匪。他们对革命表示了无限的忠诚。”
    小伙子讲得那么严肃，以至完全改变了原来的样子。我乘间插了一句：
    “这对我还是一个新闻，一个非常重要的新闻。”
    “我爹在赤卫队里一直和中国同志们在一起，中国同志们阶级觉悟高，人又机警，红军指挥员常常调他们去担任警卫工作。列宁就有过中国警卫员。”小伙子向红场那边望了一下，继续说，“打那时起，我爹就从心底里爱中国人，他这样教导我们弟兄三个：永远不要忘记，为了革命，中国人是和你爹在一起流过血的。”
    钳工同志看了下手表，站起来说：“我必须走了。相信我，我比我爹更爱中国人，我们是一起战斗过来的，我们还要一起战斗下去。请向所有的中国同志致意，如果可能，也请向小吴致意，我已经告诉他：任何力量都不能破坏我们的友谊，这是革命的友谊！”
    他坐上车，挥了挥手，一阵风似地疾驰而去。
    “是的，这是革命的友谊。”我喃喃自语。
    克里姆林的钟声响了。下班的人们拥向街头，红场上闹盈盈地，投向我的是数不尽的善意的微笑。现在我更加明白：为什么八十岁的亚美尼亚老诗人要抱病接待我们，和我们一起干杯，一起跳舞，直到深夜后两点钟才肯离席；为什么列宁格勒面包厂的工人们要安排最热闹的场面来迎接我们，要我们尝试厂里的每一件出品；为什么斯大林格勒的小学生每天放学后要到旅馆里来看我们，临别的时候把她们全部个人收藏——照片、邮票、纪念章赠送我们，这在幼小的心灵里又该是多么隆重和珍贵的礼物！难道这仅仅是一种普通的友谊吗？
    不！这是革命的友谊！我们的友谊是植根在共同的思想基础上，这样的友谊是谁也破坏不了的。愿革命的友谊万古长青！
