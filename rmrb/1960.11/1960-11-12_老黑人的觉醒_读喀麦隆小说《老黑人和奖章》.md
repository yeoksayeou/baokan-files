    The Awakening of the Old Black Man
     ——Reading the Cameroon Novel "The Old Black Man and the Medal"
    Yan Shaoduan
    "The Old Black Man and the Medal" is an excellent novella written by Cameroon's young author, Ferdinand Oyono. The author chose Mekka, an honest, kind, devout Christian, and trusting old black man who believed in the "friendship" of the French colonialists, as the protagonist of the story. With delicate and pungent strokes, he wrote about Mekka's awakening process, deeply and incisively exposing the true face of the French colonialists.
    In recent years, the great storm of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America has accelerated the collapse of the imperialist colonial system. Now the struggle is continuing to deepen, and more and more oppressed people are joining the torrent of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. Even some people who previously held illusions about the colonialists have awakened and joined the struggle. This is a sign that the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle is becoming increasingly popular, and it is proof that imperialism's lifespan is not long. The most important significance of the artistic image of the old black man Mekka in "The Old Black Man and the Medal" lies in its convincing revelation of this truth.
    The entire story revolves closely around a medal "bestowed" upon Mekka by the French colonialists. Why did Mekka receive a medal? Because his two sons served as cannon fodder for the French colonialists in World War II, and his land was swindled away by the Catholic Church to build a church. The colonialists hoped that more Mekkas would appear among the ordinary farmers of Cameroon, so they decided to commend his "merit," award him a medal, and try to make him a role model for others to emulate. In the first part of the novel, the author tries to highlight the atmosphere before Mekka received the medal. Those farmers who, like Mekka, lived in dark huts far away from the white residential areas, were excited about Mekka's "glory." Mekka's relative, Angomba, specially drove an old ram from a distant village through the forest and across the river overnight to congratulate Mekka. The second part describes Mekka receiving the award. That "glory" of receiving the award turned out to be a great humiliation: Mekka had to stand in a small circle drawn with chalk under the scorching tropical sun, waiting for the "White Great Chief" to arrive. The third part is the climax of the book, describing Mekka getting lost in a storm on the night he received the award, accidentally entering the white residential area and being arrested. The colonialists' extravagant talk of the "close friendship" between whites and blacks was still ringing in his ears, but he had already tasted the whip of the colonialists. The humiliation that followed the award made him wake up as if from a dream, and he understood that there could be no friendship between the oppressors and the oppressed, between the colonialists and the people of the colonies. "I am tired, so tired that I don't know what to say to Bird Neck (the local white police chief). Let them do whatever they want with me... Since he asks who I am, tell him that I am the last fool, who yesterday still believed in the friendship of the white man." It is easy for us to understand Mekka's grief and indignation when he said these words to the translator while being imprisoned in the police station.
    What kind of "friendship" was the "friendship" of the colonialist whites that Mekka once believed in? The colonialists lavishly said that whites were closer to blacks than brothers, but when blacks spoke to the French colonial high commissioner, it was like a defendant speaking to a judge; the hospitals run by whites always let people in alive and come out dead; poor blacks lived in dark huts, eating bananas to survive, while whites lived leisurely and comfortably in magnificent houses; after Mekka was arrested, they wouldn't even let him live in the newly painted prison cell,嫌 he was dirty... As one character in the book said: "They robbed Mekka of everything, land... sons... They took everything... everything...." Another character said: "What is left in this place of ours? Nothing is left! Nothing is left! We don't even have the freedom to refuse their rewards." All the "friendship" of the whites seemed to be only expressed in this celebration banquet for the award. Although a few blacks "appreciated" by the colonialists were invited to this banquet, the whites only toasted with whites when drinking. Mekka had been deceived for decades, and once he woke up, he would naturally be even more pained. He used to be a very devout Catholic, but now he doesn't want to hear people mention God in front of him.
      "I am the last fool," this is really the right thing to say. Mekka is not the only one who has become the "last fool," and Mekka is not the only one who has awakened from the oppression and humiliation of the colonialists.
    "Will we still have people walking into the white man's trap with their eyes open?" one character in the book asked.
    "We are not porcupines!" everyone answered in unison.
    Mekka's ancestors were once known as "lions among men," "incarnations of thunder," and "masters of the sky." They were truly strong and brave men, "who dominated the sky and land of this entire region." Mekka vaguely remembered how, in his childhood, his ancestors sharpened spears and machetes, carved wooden javelins, soaked arrowheads in poison, and went to fight the invading colonialists. A German was taken prisoner by them, and the German's head belonged to his grandfather. When he had the ability to personally kill his first leopard, the German's head was passed down from his grandfather to him, and thrown into the river on the day he became a Catholic and was baptized. From that day on, Mekka began his tragic fate, "yesterday's master became today's slave"!
    This is not just Mekka's fate, not just the fate of Mekka's clan, but the fate of all the people of Cameroon. We know that the people of Cameroon have spent long, dark years under colonial rule. They have been enslaved by the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Germans, the British, the French, and the Americans, who came the latest and were the most vicious.
    "We should be good at standing on our land," Mekka couldn't help but sigh when meditating on the glory of his ancestors resisting the invaders.
    However, Mekka did not stand up after awakening. The image of Mekka represents a part of the colonial people whose resistance is not resolute and thorough enough, because this part of the people is most deeply poisoned by the colonialists in their ideology. It is not easy for them to wake up, and it takes a process to take action after awakening. On the one hand, the humiliation he experienced aroused Mekka's deep hatred for the colonialists. He dared to curse the police, kick the door of the prison cell, kick the priests out of his home, and dare to shout loudly, "I am not afraid of the white man!" On the other hand, this deep hatred melted into a long sigh that burst out from his chest, and he said self-pityingly: "We are pitiful people!" He still cannot abandon his illusions and prepare for struggle. He pins his hopes on the future: "Perhaps, one day in the future..."
    Today's Cameroon is no longer the Cameroon of the time when the author wrote "The Old Black Man and the Medal." Today's Cameroon has declared independence, and the people of Cameroon have understood from the actions of the French colonialists that they have always used a double-dealing tactic of brutal suppression and deception towards the people of the colonies. People will not forget that in the large-scale strike and demonstration against the French colonialists in May 1955, more than 5,000 Cameroonians were killed and more than 10,000 were arrested, creating the shocking "May Massacre." It was after the "May Massacre" that they took up arms and launched a difficult armed struggle against the colonialists. And in their armed struggle, they saw with their own eyes how the American neo-colonialists used weapons to assist the French colonial army in massacring their compatriots, so they and all Africans raised their arms and shouted: "Old and new colonialists get out of Africa!"
    Now, the people of Cameroon are continuing the struggle to drive the colonialists out of Cameroon. The day that Mekka hopes for will surely come.

    老黑人的觉醒
     ——读喀麦隆小说《老黑人和奖章》
    严绍端
    《老黑人和奖章》是喀麦隆青年作家裴迪南·奥约诺写的一部优秀的中篇小说。作者选择了一个纯朴、善良、虔诚信奉基督教、信赖法国殖民者“友谊”的老黑人麦卡来作故事的主角，用细腻而辛辣的笔触抒写了麦卡的觉醒过程，深刻入微地揭露了法国殖民者的本来面目。
    近年来，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动的巨大风暴，使帝国主义殖民体系正在加速崩溃。现在斗争正在继续深入发展，愈来愈多的被压迫人民投入到反帝国主义反殖民主义的巨流里来，甚至有些过去对殖民者存有幻想的人，也觉醒过来参加了斗争。这是反帝国主义反殖民主义斗争日益深入人心的标志，是帝国主义寿命不长的证明。《老黑人和奖章》中老黑人麦卡这个艺术形象的最重要的意义，就在于它令人信服地揭示了这一个真理。
    整个故事自始至终都是紧紧围绕着法国殖民者“赏赐”给麦卡的一枚奖章来展开的。麦卡为什么会得到一枚奖章？因为他的两个儿子在第二次世界大战中为法国殖民者作了炮灰，他的土地又被天主教会骗去盖了教堂。殖民者希望在喀麦隆的普通农民中出现更多的麦卡，才决定表彰他的“功绩”，奖给他一枚奖章，想把他当做别人模仿的榜样。在小说的第一部，作者极力烘托麦卡得到奖章以前的气氛。那些和麦卡一样生活在远离白人住宅区的阴暗茅屋里的农民们，都为麦卡的这一“光荣”感到兴奋，麦卡的亲戚安冈巴特意从遥远的乡村里星夜赶着一头老公羊，穿过森林与大河来向麦卡祝贺。第二部描写麦卡受奖的情况。那受奖的“光荣”原来是一场莫大的屈辱：麦卡不得不在毒辣的热带太阳底下，站在用粉笔画成的一个小圈圈里等待着“白人大酋长”到来。第三部是全书的高潮，写麦卡受奖的那天夜里，在暴风雨中迷失方向，误入白人住宅区而被捕。他的耳际还萦绕着殖民者侈谈白人与黑人“亲密友谊”的话语，他的身上却已饱尝殖民者的皮鞭的滋味。紧接着受奖而来的屈辱，使他如梦初醒，明白了压迫者和被压迫者、殖民者和殖民地人民之间不会有什么友谊的。“我很疲倦，疲倦得不知道应该对鸟脖子（当地的白人警察局长）说些什么话。他们爱把我怎么办就怎么办吧……既然他问我是谁，你就说我是最后一个傻瓜，昨天我还相信白人的友谊。”麦卡被囚禁在警察局对翻译员说这几句话时的悲愤的心情，我们是很容易领会的。
    麦卡曾经相信过的殖民者白人的“友谊”到底是什么样的“友谊”呢？殖民者天花乱坠地说什么白人对黑人比兄弟还亲，可是，黑人和法国殖民地高级专员说话，就像被告和法官说话；白人办的医院，老是让人活的进去死的出来；穷苦的黑人住在阴暗茅屋里吃香蕉度日，白人却在富丽堂皇的高房大屋里过着悠闲舒适的生活；麦卡被捕以后，连刚刚粉刷过的牢房都不让他住，嫌他肮脏……。正如书中一个人物所说：“他们把麦卡抢光了，土地……儿子……他们把一切都拿走了……一切……。”另一个人物说：“我们这个地方还剩下什么？什么也不剩！什么也不剩！就连拒绝他们的赏赐的自由都没有。”白人的全部“友谊”似乎就只表现在这次庆祝授奖的宴会上。这次宴会虽然有少数为殖民者“赏识”的黑人被邀参加，但在喝酒的时候，白人也只和白人碰杯。麦卡被骗了几十年，一旦醒悟，自然会倍加沉痛。他原是一个十分虔诚的天主教徒，现在却不愿意再听到人们在他面前提起上帝。
      “我是最后一个傻瓜，”这话真是说得对极了。做了“最后一个傻瓜”的并不只麦卡一人，在殖民者的欺凌与屈辱中觉醒过来的也不只麦卡一人。
    “我们还会有人睁着眼睛上白人的圈套吗？”书中一个人物这样问道。
    “我们不是豪猪！”众人齐声回答。
    麦卡的祖先曾经被誉为“人中狮子”、“雷电化身”、“天空主宰”，他们是真正刚强勇敢的人，是“支配这儿整个地区的天空和土地的人”。麦卡依稀记得，在自己的童年时代，他的祖辈们怎样磨快长矛和弯刀，怎样用木头削成投枪，把箭簇浸透毒药，前去和入侵的殖民者作战，一个德国人作了他们的俘虏，这个德国人的脑壳归他的祖父所有。当他有本领亲自打死第一只豹时，这个德国人的脑壳由他的祖父传到他手里，在他成为天主教徒受洗的那天扔到河里去了。从那一天起，麦卡开始了悲惨的命运，“昨天的主人变成了今天的奴隶”！
    这不是麦卡一个人的命运，不是麦卡一族人的命运，而是喀麦隆全体人民的命运。我们知道，喀麦隆人民曾经在殖民统治下度过了漫长的、暗无天日的岁月。先后奴役过他们的有葡萄牙人、荷兰人、德国人、英国人、法国人，还有那来得最晚、也是最穷凶极恶的美国人。
    “应当善于站立在我们的土地上”，麦卡在瞑想祖辈反抗入侵者的光荣时，不禁这样慨叹起来。
    然而，麦卡在觉醒之后并没有挺身站立起来。麦卡这个形象代表了殖民地人民中一部分人的反抗还是不够坚决彻底的，因为这一部分人在思想意识上受殖民者的毒害最深。他们觉醒过来已不容易，觉醒之后要采取行动更需要一个过程。一方面，亲身经历的屈辱激起了麦卡对殖民者的刻骨仇恨，他敢于大骂警察，猛踢囚室的门，把教士从他的家里喝出去，敢于大声喊出“我不怕白人！”另一方面，这种刻骨仇恨又溶化在从胸中迸出的一阵长叹里，自怨自艾地说：“我们是可怜的人！”他还不能丢掉幻想就准备斗争。他把希望寄托在未来：“也许，将来有一天……”
    今天的喀麦隆已经不是作者写《老黑人和奖章》时代的喀麦隆了。今天的喀麦隆已经宣布了独立，喀麦隆人民已经从法国殖民者的行径里懂得了他们对殖民地人民一贯施展着残酷镇压与欺骗怀柔的双重伎俩。人们不会忘记，在1955年5月那次反对法国殖民者的大规模罢工和示威游行中，喀麦隆人民被杀害的有五千多人，被捕一万多人，造成了骇人听闻的“五月惨案”。正是从“五月惨案”后，他们拿起了武器，向殖民主义者展开了艰苦的武装斗争。而在他们的武装斗争中，他们亲眼看见美国新殖民主义者如何以武器援助法国殖民军屠杀自己的同胞，因此他们和全体非洲人一起振臂高呼：“新老殖民主义者滚出非洲去！”
    现在，喀麦隆人民正在继续进行着把殖民主义者赶出喀麦隆的斗争。麦卡所希望的那一天，一定会到来。
