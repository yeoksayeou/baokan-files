    Crossing the "Mountain Ridge"
    ——Remembering the Battle of Shajiadian
    Luo Yuanfa
    I.

    After the active withdrawal from Yulin, the main force of my Northwest Field Army secretly assembled in the northwest area of ​​Shajiadian. Here, the west and north sides are vast deserts, the east side is the rolling Yellow River, the area is narrow, and there is little room for maneuver. At present, Zhong Song, the commander of the enemy's 36th Division, led two and a half brigades to Zhenchuanbao; while Liu Kan led the First Army and the Twenty-ninth Army, with eight and a half brigades, also advanced to Suide. The two enemy forces were getting closer and closer, and their claws were about to reach us. There was a lot of discussion in the troops, clamoring about what the next move should be.

    One day, I went to the Field Army Headquarters to attend a combat meeting. When I got there, the leaders of each column had arrived. Everyone was crammed into a cave, chatting about how to fight this battle. Suddenly, someone whispered, "Chairman Mao is here!"

    Hearing that Chairman Mao was here, everyone was very excited. Since the enemy's attack on Yan'an, the Kuomintang's propaganda organs have repeatedly speculated in newspapers and periodicals: Where is Mao Zedong? Our beloved leader, Chairman Mao, is in northern Shaanxi. Chairman Mao had long seen through the enemy's conspiracy: their attack on Yan'an "was also aimed at first solving the Northwest problem, cutting off our Party's right arm, and driving our Party Central Committee and the People's Liberation Army Headquarters out of the Northwest, and then mobilizing troops to attack North China, in order to achieve their goal of destroying us one by one." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, page 1219) Therefore, from the beginning of the Yan'an Defense War, Chairman Mao has always been with us, not only commanding the national battlefield, but also directly commanding the Northwest battlefield. Chairman Mao believed: "This area has dangerous terrain, good mass conditions, a large maneuver area, and is completely guaranteed in terms of safety." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, page 1219) Today, Chairman Mao has come to personally participate in our meeting, how can we not be excited?

    At the meeting, everyone presented the situation and talked about the combat plan. Chairman Mao listened carefully to each comrade's speech, constantly examining the military map in front of him. Seeing that everyone had spoken almost enough, Chairman Mao coughed slightly and said with a kind smile:

  "Comrades, you have worked hard these days."

    In fact, we all know that in these days, Chairman Mao not only climbed mountains and ridges like us, traveled long distances, did not eat well, and did not sleep well, but also had to consider many major issues. If we talk about hard work, no one is more hardworking than Chairman Mao.

    After Chairman Mao thoroughly analyzed the current national war situation, he pointed out: The current situation in northern Shaanxi is that the enemy is large and we are small, and there are indeed some difficulties, but the enemy has more and greater difficulties than us. We have the support of the people in the border area; we have the cooperation of various strategic areas across the country, and we will definitely defeat the enemy and win victory. Although Yulin has not been captured, it has mobilized the main force of Hu Zongnan's army to go north. The purpose of attacking Yulin was to coordinate the Chen Geng and Xie Fuzhi Corps in crossing the Yellow River to the south, which the enemy cannot understand, and some of our comrades are also unclear about. In a few days, when Chen and Xie act, Hu Zongnan will realize that he has made another wrong decision. Judging from the situation in northern Shaanxi, we seem to be somewhat passive, but from the overall situation, we are very active. Speaking of this, Chairman Mao made an analogy. He said: The current situation in northern Shaanxi is like what we often say about crossing a mountain ridge. When we are about to climb to the top of the ridge, we must not relax. We must grit our teeth and climb up in one go, and the road ahead will be easier to walk.

    After listening to Chairman Mao's words, I suddenly became enlightened. We cooperate with the actions of Chen and Xie's army, as long as we get rid of a group of enemies here and hold Hu Zongnan back, so that Chen and Xie's army can safely cross to the south, and in turn they will give us strong cooperation. By then, the war situation in the Northwest and the whole country will be greatly changed, and the enemy can only go downhill day by day.

    II.

    On August 18, 1947, the troops marched towards Changgaoshan. According to Chairman Mao's intention, the Field Army Headquarters decided to annihilate the enemy's 36th Division on its way forward with the First and Second Columns, and to contain Liu Kan with the Third Column, preventing him from reinforcing the 36th Division. Our Teaching Brigade was under the command of Wang Zhen, commander of the Second Column, and together with the First and Second Columns, we encircled and annihilated the enemy's 36th Division. At this time, after Liu Kan's troops occupied Suide and Mizhi, they were advancing towards Jiaxian, while Zhong Song also followed closely behind, advancing eastward in a hurry, and that day advanced to the Shajiadian area, desperately rushing towards the Yellow River.

    It turned out that a few days ago, some of our rear organs crossed the river from Heiyukou, north of Jiaxian, to the Jin-Sui liberated area, which was observed by enemy planes in the air. Hu Zongnan mistakenly estimated that our army intended to cross the river. Until today, the enemy has not discovered the movement of our army, which cannot but be grateful to the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, who have strictly blockaded the news; thoroughly carried out the policy of emptying the houses and clearing the fields, so that the enemy could not eat and could not get information, just like blind people groping for fish. In order to eliminate the enemy, the villagers gave the troops their only pumpkins and yams to eat, and organized stretcher teams and transport teams day and night to support the troops. The militiamen laid mines everywhere to attack the enemy, prevent the enemy from advancing, and cooperate with our army in combat. As soon as the enemy moved, they would run to report to us, so that our army knew everything about the enemy's actions.

    That afternoon, as we were marching, the First and Second Columns had already engaged the enemy's 36th Division on Changgaoshan. I ordered the troops to advance quickly. When entering a narrow mountain gully, the sky was suddenly covered with dark clouds, and a torrential rain poured down in an instant. The soldiers stumbled and stumbled, advancing in the rain like twisting yangko. At this time, I was worried that if the troops did not arrive on time, they would not be able to complete the encirclement of the enemy, and if the enemy realized our intention, things would be difficult. The troops continued to move forward, and they had to cross a mountain slope ahead. It was dark and the road was slippery, and nothing could be seen. In order to avoid losing contact and falling, the soldiers came up with a good idea. Everyone took off their leggings and twisted them into a thick rope, grabbed the rope and walked, and some walked with sticks. They proceeded with such difficulty. At dawn the next day, the troops arrived in the northwest area of ​​Changgaoshan. I was about to ask about the situation ahead when the reconnaissance section chief ran over and reported: "After a brief contact between the First and Second Columns and the enemy's 36th Division on Changgaoshan, the enemy shrank to the Shajiadian and Nigouze area." I thought to myself: If Liu Kan turned his head west and the two enemy forces stuck together, then we would not be able to gnaw on them easily.

    On the 19th, I received a telegram from my superiors, clarifying that the enemy had not approached, and that a part of Liu Kan's main force had advanced to the Jiaxian and Shenquanbao line on the Yellow River; while the arrogant Zhong Song dared to divide his troops into two groups to race with Liu Kan. His advance echelon, the 123rd Brigade and the attached 493rd Regiment, had stretched to the area north of Wulongpu yesterday, while the rear echelon led by Zhong Song himself—the 36th Division Headquarters and the 165th Brigade—was left alone behind. It seems that the torrential rain last night did not cool down the enemy's feverish heads. They still dreamed of forcing our army to cross the Yellow River to the east and reaping the "effect of attacking them halfway." Therefore, the higher authorities insisted that the established determination to eliminate the enemy's 36th Division remained unchanged, and ordered the New Fourth Brigade to resist the 123rd Brigade on Changgaoshan, resolutely tearing Zhong Song's troops into two halves and not allowing them to approach.

    That afternoon, the First and Second Columns launched an attack on the enemy's 36th Division's main force in Shajiadian from the east and west. This fierce blow awakened Zhong Song: It turned out that the main force of the "Communist Army" had not crossed the river, but was right under his nose. So he hurriedly telegraphed the 123rd Brigade, ordering them to approach him overnight. The commander of the enemy's 123rd Brigade, Liu Ziqi, had already sensed something at this time. Seeing that the situation was not good, the connection between him and Liu Kan had been cut off by our army's Third Column. If he turned back to approach Shajiadian, he would inevitably fall into a predicament with blocking forces in front and pursuing troops behind. So he stayed put. Despite Zhong Song's repeated orders and threats of beheading, Liu Ziqi used the excuse that it was difficult to walk in the dark and turned his head west until the next morning. But our New Fourth Brigade was deployed in the Changgaoshan area that night, just waiting for his arrival.

    III.

    On the 20th, our Teaching Brigade received orders to advance in the direction of Shajiadian. After climbing to the top of the mountain, I discussed with several leaders of the brigade and decided that our brigade would insert itself from the west of Changgaoshan, between the New Fourth Brigade and the Second Column, to cooperate with the Second Column in eliminating the enemy's 36th Division's main force. Then, we found the cadres of each regiment and clearly explained the specific tasks, and the troops began to move. At this time, enemy planes were circling and strafing at low altitude, and the ground artillery fire was also fiercely bombarding us, attempting to stop our army from advancing. The troops braved the hail of bullets and continued to move in the predetermined direction.

    Arriving near Changgaoshan, we saw that the battle on the New Fourth Brigade's position in the east was very fierce. The enemy was concentrating its forces and firepower in an attempt to seize the broken temple on the top of the mountain—the commanding height of Changgaoshan. Resisting the enemy there was a battalion of the 771st Regiment of the New Fourth Brigade, directly commanded by their deputy regiment commander. They stubbornly resisted the enemy, repelling the enemy's attacks several times in a row. When I looked further west, I saw that this mountain top was very close to the Second Column's position. If the Changgaoshan position was lost, it would seriously threaten the flanks of the Second Column. Seeing this situation, we unanimously believed that Changgaoshan could not be lost no matter what. We decided to transfer the Second Regiment to reinforce the Changgaoshan position, while the First Regiment would continue to carry out its original mission.

    In order to facilitate observation and command, we came to the Changgaoshan position. I said to the deputy regiment commander of the 771st Regiment: "Hold on firmly, our Second Regiment will arrive soon." Then, he gave me a detailed introduction to the specific positions of the enemy and us. At present, the position of the New Fourth Brigade was semi-circular, and the enemy's 123rd Brigade was desperately trying to drill inside in order to quickly approach its main force. A thought flashed into my mind: If our Teaching Brigade inserted itself from the right wing of the New Fourth Brigade and sandwiched them from both sides, wouldn't we be encircling the enemy in the middle? This is exactly the time when we need to implement correct maneuver. Although this would relatively weaken the attacking force against Zhong Song, and the Second Column would have a heavier burden, as long as we resolutely eliminated the enemy's 123rd Brigade, we would guarantee the safety of the main force's flanks. Didn't Chairman Mao teach us? We must cross the mountain ridge in one go. While reporting to our superiors, we sent someone to order the First Regiment to change its original plan and turn around to encircle and annihilate the enemy's 123rd Brigade.

    The higher authorities quickly approved our action. At this time, the comrades from the political department immediately went to each regiment to do political mobilization work. The political department issued the resounding political slogans: "Defend the Party Central Committee! Defend Chairman Mao!" "Resolutely eliminate the 123rd Brigade and capture Liu Ziqi alive!" Regardless of how fierce the enemy's artillery fire was or how rampant the enemy planes were, all the commanders and fighters continued to advance. Everyone had only one belief: resolutely eliminate the enemy!

    As soon as the Second Regiment entered the battle, it strengthened the Changgaoshan position, weakened the enemy's attack, and the First Regiment also quickly detoured to the right wing of Changgaoshan; at the same time, the New Fourth Brigade also quickly thrust towards the left wing, and the encirclement was getting smaller and smaller. It looked like the encirclement was about to close. At this time, on the junction between our New Fourth Brigade and Teaching Brigade in the east, there was a unit of the Third Column. They were originally following the enemy's 123rd Brigade to support the New Fourth Brigade's resistance. At this critical moment, they did not understand our intention and contracted their troops to the east, preparing to resist Liu Kan's reinforcement troops. Their departure would inevitably leave a gap, allowing the enemy to break through. Seeing this situation, the brigade commander immediately ordered a reconnaissance staff officer to contact them. After receiving the order, the staff officer climbed several mountain tops in one breath before catching up with the rearguard troops there. At this time, only one company was left that had not yet withdrawn. The staff officer found the instructor of the company and said breathlessly: "The New and Teaching Brigades...are going to eat up the enemy's 123rd Brigade..., the brigade commander asks you to stay...and block...," After this excellent Communist Party member conveyed the order, he fainted to the ground. After learning about this situation, they stayed and blocked the gap. At this point, our army cut the enemy's 36th Division into two pieces on the Shajiadian and Changgaoshan line and encircled them.

    IV.

    Zhong Song's situation was like ants on a hot pot. He pinned his only hope on Liu Kan, waiting for him to relieve the danger of the overthrown nest. Little did he know that Liu Kan was scolded by Hu Zongnan for "ineffective assistance to Yulin," and he was already full of anger at Zhong Song. This time, he had worked so hard to get to the Yellow River, but he had not found the main force of the "Communist Army." So after receiving Hu Zongnan's telegram ordering him to "reinforce Zhong Song," he felt even more angry, so he hesitated to move forward. He led four brigades of troops, and it was not until the afternoon of the 20th that he arrived south of Wulongpu, where he was met with a head-on blow from our Third Column and the Fourth and Sixth Regiments of the Jin-Sui Military Region. Even his guards were dispersed, and many people were taken prisoner. Liu Kan was firmly blocked by our army and could not move forward. Although he was only thirty miles away from Zhong Song, he was "helpless."

    With Liu Kan blocked, we were completely relieved of our concerns about enemy reinforcements. After our brigade's Second Regiment captured Changxinzhuang, it took advantage of the victory to capture several mountain tops. The First Regiment cooperated with the Second Regiment to carry out encirclement. At this time, the New Fourth Brigade was also rapidly approaching from the left wing, and the two pincers were firmly stuck. Before dusk, the enemy's 123rd Brigade was completely wiped out, and Liu Ziqi himself was taken prisoner.

    That Zhong Song, who had "rendered meritorious service in assisting Yulin," was calling to heaven and earth without response near dusk. Just as he was jumping with rage, the general attack of our First and Second Columns began. Seeing that the general trend was over, Zhong Song changed into civilian clothes with Li Riji, the brigade commander of the 165th Brigade, and slipped away. Because the hope for reinforcements was lost and the commander-in-chief fled, the enemy's morale was even more shaken. Under the fierce attack of the First and Second Columns, the enemy's 36th Division Headquarters and the 165th Brigade were also completely annihilated by us.

    The victory of the Shajiadian battle was achieved under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao; it was the victory of Chairman Mao's military thought; it was the victory of Chairman Mao's military principles of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one" and "attacking the scattered and isolated enemy first, and then attacking the concentrated and strong enemy"; it was the victory of Chairman Mao's "mushroom tactics." On the Northwest battlefield, thanks to the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and the strong support of the people in the border area, we shifted from defense to offense after annihilating a large number of enemies. The Shajiadian battle was the turning point from defense to offense on the Northwest battlefield.

    On the third day after the end of the Shajiadian battle, our Chen and Xie Corps crossed the Yellow River east of Tongguan with the force of thunder, cutting off the Longhai Railway. With Tongguan in urgent need of relief and Xi'an under pressure, Hu Zongnan hurriedly ordered Liu Kan to abandon Jiaxian, Mizhi, and Suide, which he had just acquired, and mobilized eight brigades of his troops to flee south in a panic, and our army took advantage of the victory to pursue.

    The counterattack of our Northwest battlefield began.

    Standing on the loess plateau of northern Shaanxi, watching the enemy fleeing in embarrassment, Chairman Mao's brilliant prediction of crossing the "mountain ridge" once again emerged in my mind. The fate of the "Chiang family dynasty" is like the water of the Yellow River, which is about to collapse and flow eastward for thousands of miles!

    过“山坳”
    ——忆沙家店战役
    罗元发
    一
    从榆林主动撤下来以后，我西北野战军主力隐蔽地集结在沙家店西北地区。这里，西、北两面是浩瀚的沙漠，东面是滚滚的黄河，地区狭窄，回旋余地很小。眼前，敌三十六师师长钟松率领两个半旅，到了镇川堡；而刘戡率领第一军，二十九军八个半旅的兵力亦进至绥德。两路敌人，越靠越近，魔爪眼看就要伸到我们面前，部队里议论纷纷，嚷嚷着下步棋该怎么走。
    一天，我到野战军司令部去开作战会议，到了那里，各纵队的领导同志都来了，大家挤在一孔窑洞里闲扯着这一仗如何打法，忽然有人小声说：“毛主席来了！”
    听说主席来了，大家非常兴奋。自从敌人进攻延安，国民党的宣传机关曾多次在报刊上猜测：毛泽东在何处？我们敬爱的领袖毛主席就在陕北。主席早就识透了敌人的阴谋诡计：他们进攻延安，“还为着妄图首先解决西北问题，割断我党右臂，并且驱逐我党中央和人民解放军总部出西北，然后调动兵力进攻华北，达到其各个击破的目的。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1219页）因此，从延安保卫战开始，主席始终和我们在一起，不仅指挥着全国战场，而且直接指挥着西北战场。主席认为：“此区地形险要，群众条件好，回旋地区大，安全方面完全有保障。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1219页）今天，毛主席又来亲自参加我们的会议，怎能不叫人兴奋呢？
    会议上，大家都摆了情况，谈了打法。主席仔细地听着每个同志的发言，不时查看着面前的军用地图。看到大家讲的差不多了，主席轻微地咳嗽了一声，笑容可掬地说：
  “这些天来，同志们很辛苦。”
    其实，我们都知道，在这些日子里，主席不仅和我们一样地翻山越岭，长途跋涉，吃不好，睡不好，而且还要考虑许多重大问题，要说辛苦，再没有比主席更辛苦的了。
    主席详尽地分析了当前全国的战局以后指出：目前陕北的情况是敌大我小，确实有些困难，但是敌人比我们的困难更多，更大。我们有边区人民的支援；有全国各战略区的配合，我们一定能打败敌人，取得胜利。榆林虽未攻下，但却调动了胡宗南军主力北上。打榆林是为了策应陈赓、谢富治兵团南渡黄河，这一点敌人是不能理解的，我们有些同志也闹不清楚。再过几天，陈、谢一行动，胡宗南就会觉察他又错打了主意。从陕北的情况看起来，我们好像有些被动，从全局来看，我们是非常主动的。讲到这里，主席打了个比喻，他说：眼前陕北的处境，就像我们常说的过山坳一样，快爬到山坳坳上时，千万不敢松劲，要咬紧牙关一鼓作气地爬上去，往后的路子就好走了。
    听了主席的话，我豁然开朗。我们配合陈、谢大军的行动，只要在这儿搞掉敌人一股，拖住胡宗南，使陈、谢大军安全南渡，翻过来他们又给我们以有力的配合，到那时，西北战局和全国一样，就要大大改观，而敌人就只能一天天地走下坡路了。
    二
    1947年8月18日，部队向常高山进发。根据毛主席的意图，野战军司令部决定以一、二纵队在敌前进途中歼灭敌三十六师，以三纵箝制刘戡，阻止其增援三十六师。我们教导旅归二纵队王震司令员指挥，和一、二纵一起围歼敌三十六师。这时，刘戡所部占领绥德、米脂以后，正向葭县进发，而钟松也尾随其后向东急进，当天进至沙家店地区，他们拚命地向黄河边上赶。
    原来，前些日子，我们有些后方机关，从葭县以北的黑峪口渡河到晋绥解放区去，被敌机在空中观察到了，胡宗南错误地估计我军有渡河的意图。直到今天，敌人还没有发觉我军的动向，这不能不感激陕甘宁边区的人民，他们严密地封锁了消息；彻底地进行了空舍清野，使敌人吃不上，也得不到情报，真像瞎子摸鱼一样。为了消灭敌人，老乡们将自己仅有的南瓜、山药蛋送给部队吃，日夜组织担架队、运输队支援部队。民兵们到处埋设地雷打击敌人，阻止敌人前进，配合我军作战。敌人一有动静，他们便跑来向我们报告，使我军对敌人的一行一动都了如指掌。
    当天下午我们正行进中，一、二纵队与敌三十六师已在常高山上接火了，我命令部队迅速前进。当进入一条狭窄的山沟时，天空突然黑云密布，霎时大雨倾盆而下，战士们跌跌撞撞，像扭秧歌一样冒雨前进。这时候，我耽心部队如不按时到达，就不能完成对敌包围，敌人觉察了我们的意图，事情就不好办了。部队继续向前运动，前面要翻过一个山坡，天黑路滑，啥也看不清。为了避免失掉联络和摔跌，战士们想出一个好法子，大家拿下绑带，拧成一根粗绳，抓住绳子走，有的拄着棍子走。就这样困难地行进。第二天拂晓，部队来到了常高山西北地区。我正要问前面的情况，侦察科长跑来报告说：“一、二纵队在常高山和敌三十六师稍事接触之后，敌人就龟缩至沙家店、泥沟则一带。”我心想：要是刘戡调头西进，两股敌人粘在一起，那我们就不容易啃了。
    19日，接到上级电报，查明敌人并没有靠拢，刘戡主力一部已进至黄河边葭县、神泉堡一线；而那个狂妄的钟松竟敢分兵两股与刘戡赛跑，他的前梯队一百二十三旅及配属的四百九十三团，昨日已伸至乌龙铺以北地区，而由钟松自己带领的后梯队——三十六师师部及一百六十五旅，却孤零零地掉在后边。看来昨夜一场瓢泼大雨，并没有把敌人发热的头脑浇醒，他们仍然梦想着逼我军东渡黄河，收其“半渡而击之效”。因此，上级坚持消灭敌三十六师的既定决心不变，并命令新四旅在常高山抗击一百二十三旅，坚决地把钟松的兵马撕成两半，不准他们靠拢。
    这天下午，一、二纵队由东西两面向沙家店之敌三十六师主力发起了进攻，这狠狠的一棒，才把钟松捶醒：原来“共军”主力并未渡河，就在他的眼皮底下。于是急忙电令一百二十三旅，星夜向他靠拢。而敌一百二十三旅旅长刘子奇这时已嗅出一点味道来了，他看到情况不妙，他与刘戡之间的联系已被我军三纵队割断，如果回头向沙家店靠拢，势必陷于前有堵击后有追兵的困境，于是来了个按兵不动。尽管钟松三令五申，以杀头相威胁，而刘子奇则以天黑难走为借口，迟至第二天早晨才调头西进。但我新四旅当晚就布置在常高山一带，单等他的到来。
    三
    20日，我教导旅接到命令，向沙家店方向前进。登上山顶，我和旅里几个领导同志商议了一下，决定我旅从常高山以西，新四旅与二纵队中间插过去，配合二纵队消灭敌三十六师主力。接着，我们将各团的干部找来，明确交代了具体的任务，部队就开始运动了。这时，敌机在低空盘旋扫射，地面的炮火也向我猛烈地轰击，企图阻拦我军前进。部队冒着枪林弹雨，不停地向预定方向运动。
    到达常高山附近，只见东边新四旅阵地上的战斗非常激烈，敌人正集中兵力与火力企图夺取山顶的破庙——这是常高山的制高点。在那里抗击敌人的是新四旅七七一团的一个营，由他们副团长直接指挥。他们顽强地阻击着敌人，连续击退了敌人好几次冲击。我再往西一看，见这个山头距二纵队的阵地很近，假若常高山阵地丢失，就会严重地威胁到二纵的侧背。看到这种情况，我们一致认为：常高山无论如何不能丢。我们决定调二团来加强常高山阵地，一团仍执行原任务。
    为了便于观察和指挥，我们来到了常高山阵地。我对七七一团副团长说：“坚决抗住，我们二团很快就会赶到。”接着，他将敌我双方的具体位置向我作了详细的介绍。眼前新四旅的阵地形成了半圆形，敌一百二十三旅为了迅速和其主力靠拢，拚命地向里面钻。我脑子里顿时闪出了个念头，要是我们教导旅从新四旅的右翼插过去，两面一夹，岂不是把敌人包在中间了吗？眼前正是需要我们实行正确机动的时候。虽然这样一来，对钟松的攻击力量会相对地减弱，二纵队的担子更重了一点，但是只要我们坚决消灭了敌一百二十三旅，就保证了主力侧翼的安全。主席不是教导过我们吗？过山坳必须一鼓作气。我们一面报告上级，一面派人命令一团改变原来计划，调头向东围歼敌一百二十三旅。
    上级很快就批准了我们这一行动。这时，政治部的同志立刻分头到各团去做政治动员工作。政治部发出了响亮的政治口号：“保卫党中央！保卫毛主席！”“坚决消灭一百二十三旅，活捉刘子奇！”全体指战员不管敌人的炮火多么猛烈，敌机如何猖狂，仍不断地前进着，大家只有一个信念：坚决消灭敌人！
    二团一投入战斗，加强了常高山阵地，敌人的进攻削弱了，一团也迅速向常高山右翼迂回过去；与此同时，新四旅也迅速向左翼猛插，包围圈越缩越小。眼看包围圈就要合拢。这时候，在我们新四旅、教导旅东面的接合部位上，有三纵的一个部队，他们原来尾随敌一百二十三旅，策应新四旅抗击，正在这节骨眼上，他们不了解我们的意图，把部队向东收缩了一下，准备去抗击刘戡的增援部队。他们一走，势必丢下一个口子，使敌人有突围的可能。旅长看到这个情况，即令一个侦察参谋前去联系。那个参谋同志接受命令后，一气爬了几个山头，才追上那里的后卫部队。这时候他们只剩下一个连尚未撤走，参谋找到该连的指导员，气喘吁吁地说：“新、教两旅……要吃掉敌人一百二十三旅……，旅长请你们留下……堵住，……”这个优秀的共产党员传达完命令之后，便昏厥在地。他们得知这个情况后就留下来，堵住了这个口子。至此，我军在沙家店、常高山一线将敌三十六师切成两块，分割包围起来。
    四
    钟松的处境，犹如热锅上的蚂蚁，他将唯一的希望寄托在刘戡身上，等他来解复巢之危。殊不知刘戡因“援榆不力”挨了胡宗南一顿大骂，本来对钟松就有一肚子的气，这次，辛辛苦苦赶到黄河之滨，又没有发现“共军”主力。所以接到胡宗南“增援钟松”的电令以后，心里更是窝火，故而迟迟不前。他率四个旅之众，直到20日下午才到了乌龙铺以南，遭到我三纵及晋绥分区的四、六团的迎头痛击，连他的警卫队也给冲散了，不少人当了俘虏。刘戡被我军死死阻住，不能前进一步，虽然距钟松只有三十余里，却是“爱莫能助”。
    刘戡被阻，我们完全解除了对敌增援的顾虑。我旅二团攻下常辛庄以后，乘胜拿下几个山头，一团协同二团对敌实施迂回包围，这时，新四旅也从左翼节节逼近，两把钳子死死卡住，在黄昏以前，将敌一百二十三旅干干净净消灭了，刘子奇本人也当了俘虏。
    那位“援榆有功”的钟松，快到黄昏时分，叫天天不应，叫地地不灵，正在暴跳如雷，我一、二纵队的总攻开始了。钟松见大势已去，于是和一百六十五旅旅长李日基换上便衣溜之大吉。敌人因援兵无望，主帅逃跑，军心更加动摇，在一、二纵队的猛烈攻击下，敌三十六师师部与一百六十五旅也被我全部歼灭。
    沙家店战役的胜利，是在毛主席直接领导之下取得的；是毛主席军事思想的胜利；是毛主席“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”、“先打分散和孤立之敌，后打集中和强大之敌”的军事原则的胜利；是毛主席“蘑菇战术”的胜利。在西北战场上，由于有毛主席的直接领导，由于边区人民的大力支援，我们在大量歼灭敌人之后，由防御转入了进攻，沙家店战役就是西北战场上由防御转为进攻的转折点。
    沙家店战役结束后的第三天，我陈、谢兵团以雷霆万钧之势，从潼关以东跨过黄河，切断了陇海铁路。潼关告急，西安吃紧，胡宗南连忙叫刘戡放弃刚刚拿到手的葭县、米脂、绥德，调集其八个旅的兵力仓惶南逃，我军乘胜追击。
    我西北战场的反攻开始了。
    我们站在陕北的黄土高原上，望着敌人狼狈逃窜的情景，毛主席过“山坳”的英明预断又在我的脑海中涌现出来，“蒋家王朝”的命运，犹如黄河之水，即将一溃千里，付诸东流！
