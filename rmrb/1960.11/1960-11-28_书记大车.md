Secretary Driver
Hangzhou Railway Bureau, An Niu

The scorching sun tormented people like a ball of fire. There wasn't a trace of wind. The few birch trees in front of the car depot were baked with wrinkled leaves. Everyone was taking a midday rest, and the surroundings were quiet. Only the locomotives, moving in and out, were as vigorous as ever, making roaring sounds. The locomotive dispatch room was also at its most leisurely at this time. The daily operating plan had been arranged, and they were just waiting for the crews to come to work on time. Dispatcher Xiao Wang was sitting under the electric fan, enjoying this precious moment to the fullest. Suddenly, ding-a-ling-a-ling! The telephone rang, breaking the tranquility of the room. Xiao Wang picked up the headset, and before he could speak, an urgent voice immediately entered his ear: "Hello, hello! I am the fireman of train 1835 from the station. Our Chief Qian (a respectful term for the driver) is sick. He is dizzy and vomiting, probably suffering from heatstroke and unable to continue working. Please send a driver to replace him immediately. Hurry! The train is only thirty minutes away from departure time, otherwise the train will be delayed!" "What! Chief Qian is sick, immediately send a driver to replace him." This matter left Xiao Wang, who had only been doing locomotive dispatch work for a short time, at a loss with the headset in his hand. Where could he find someone to replace him at this time? The crew members had all gone home to rest. The drivers here were all in fixed positions, and they were all about to go to work. The time was so tight, and if he called someone in temporarily, it would take at least an hour. Xiao Wang looked at the neat rows of dispatch lists in a daze, and said to himself: "It looks like I have to ask the dispatch office to delay the departure." Just as he was about to pick up the dispatch phone to report the difficulties, a powerful hand suddenly pinched Xiao Wang's headset: "No, no! It can't be delayed. Don't you know this train is a coal train sent to the steel mill? We must resolutely ensure the timely transportation of steel and grain, not even a minute late!" Party Secretary Yuan, who didn't know when he had stood behind Xiao Wang, said decisively.

"But there is really no one!" Xiao Wang said to Secretary Yuan with embarrassment. "There is, I'll find a way for you! Solve the problem in five minutes. You quickly call and tell the engine crew to make all preparations. The driver will arrive immediately and ensure a punctual departure." After Secretary Yuan finished speaking, he left the locomotive dispatch room in three steps. Xiao Wang watched Secretary Yuan's back disappear, still half believing and half doubting in his heart.

Before a pipe of tobacco's time had passed, Secretary Yuan had appeared in front of Xiao Wang fully "armed," like a warrior about to go on an expedition waiting for the commander's departure order, pointing to himself cheerfully and saying: "The person, isn't he here?" Xiao Wang looked at Secretary Yuan's outfit: a set of half-new and not-so-old work clothes, with two large patches on them, holding an inspection hammer in his hand, and wearing a pair of black leather shoes with soles at least two inches thick, and then he suddenly realized, and said in surprise: "Secretary Yuan: It's you..." "What! Is it not suitable?" Secretary Yuan saw Xiao Wang's hesitant face and said: "Oh! Are you saying that I can't guarantee safe operation? Please rest assured, I guarantee safety and punctuality, and deliver the coal truck without a minute's delay, not letting our steel furnace wait for grain." "No, no!" Xiao Wang looked at the scorching sun outside the window and then at the energetic Secretary Yuan, and said hesitantly: "I mean, we can't be without you here, and besides... it's so hot..." "Ha, ha! According to you, our trains should stop in the summer! We are crew members, what do these things matter? There are still Secretary Chen and Secretary Ding here, if anything happens, look for them." Secretary Yuan's words made Xiao Wang blush. "Don't hesitate, quickly hand over the driver's report form to me." Xiao Wang pulled open the desk drawer and handed him the report form. At this time, Secretary Yuan saluted Dispatcher Xiao Wang solemnly, just like other drivers going to work, straddled his bicycle and flew straight to the station! Xiao Wang stood at the door watching Secretary Yuan's back until it disappeared, and a warm current rose in his heart. He said to himself: "No wonder he has been the secretary for so many years, and everyone hasn't forgotten his driver's name, always calling him Secretary Driver!"

    书记大车
    杭州铁路局　安牛
    烈日像一团火那样地折磨着人，没有一点风的影子，车房前几棵大桦树被烤得皱了叶子，人们都午休了，周围是静悄悄的，只有进进出出的火车头还和往常一样矫健，发出隆隆的吼叫。机调室里这时也最安闲，日班运行计划都已安排好了，只要等着一班班的乘务员来按时上班就行了。派班员小王正坐在电风扇下，在尽情享受着这可贵的时刻。忽然，滴铃铃铃！电话铃声打破了室内的安宁。小王拿起耳机还没开口，一个急骤的声气立即传入他的耳中：“喂喂！我是车站1835次列车司炉，我们钱大车（司机的尊称）病了，头晕、吐，大概是中暑不能继续工作，请立即派一位大车来替班，要快，列车离出发时间只有三十分钟，否则列车就要晚点了！”“什么！钱大车病了，立即派一位大车替班。”这件事，弄得刚做机调工作不久的小王拿着耳机束手无策，这时候哪里去找人替班呢？乘务员们都回家休息了，在这里的大车都是一个萝卜一个坑，都是马上就要上班的，时间又这么紧，临时叫班吧，最快也得一小时。小王看着一排排整齐的派班名单发楞，自言自语说：“看样子只好请求调度所晚开了。”他刚要拿起调度电话汇报困难情况时，突然一只有力的大手捏住了小王的耳机：“不，不！不能晚开，您不知道这趟车是送到钢厂的一列车煤吗？我们要坚决保证按时运送钢铁粮食，一分钟也不能晚点！”党委袁书记不知什么时候站在小王后面斩钉截铁地说。
  “可实在没有人啊！”小王看着袁书记为难地说。“有人，我给您想办法！五分钟解决问题，你赶快打电话告诉机班，叫他们做好一切准备工作，大车立即就到，保证正点开出。”袁书记说完，三脚两步离开了机调室。小王直看到袁书记的背影消失了，心里还是半信半疑。
    没等一袋烟工夫，袁书记已全部“武装”出现在小王面前，像一个刚要出征的战士在等待着首长的出发命令，爽朗地指了指自己说：“人，这不是就来了吗？”小王看着袁书记这一身装束：一套半新不旧的工作服，上面还有两个大补绽，手拿着检车子锤，穿着一双足有二寸厚的汽车底黑皮鞋，这才恍然大悟，惊奇地说：“袁书记：是您……”“怎么！不合适吗？”袁书记看到小王犹豫的脸，就说：“噢！您是说我不能保证运行安全吗？请放心，保证安全正点，一分钟也不差地把煤车运到，不叫咱炼钢炉子等着粮食。”“不，不！”小王看了看窗外的烈日又看了看精神奕奕的袁书记，吞吞吐吐说：“我是说这里不能少你，况且……天又这样热……”“哈，哈！照您这样说，夏天我们火车就该停起来！我们是乘务员嘛，这些又算得了什么呢？这里还有陈书记、丁书记，有事找他们好了。”袁书记的几句话说得小王脸红了。“不要踌躇了，快把司机报单交给我。”小王抽开办公桌抽屉，把报单交了给他，这时袁书记像和其它司机上班一样，严肃地向派班员小王敬了个礼，跨上了他的自行车直向车站飞去！小王站在门口目送着袁书记的背影，直到消失为止，心里升起了一阵热哄哄的暖流，心里说：“怪不得他当书记这多年，大家还没把他的大车名字忘记，始终叫他书记大车哩！”
