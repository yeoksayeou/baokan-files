Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 26th Dispatch: Six thousand electrical workers in Milan, Italy, held a large-scale mass demonstration on the 24th, demanding wage increases.

To achieve their demands, these electrical workers have been on an indefinite half-day strike every day since the 22nd.

Starting at 1:00 PM on the 24th, these workers marched from Milan's industrial district to a square in the city center, where they held a mass rally.

The demonstrators called on residents of other social strata in Milan to support their struggle.

Strikes have also broken out among other industries in Italy. The 50,000 confectionery workers, who had just held a nationwide strike a few days ago, went on strike again on the 25th to realize their demand for wage increases.
