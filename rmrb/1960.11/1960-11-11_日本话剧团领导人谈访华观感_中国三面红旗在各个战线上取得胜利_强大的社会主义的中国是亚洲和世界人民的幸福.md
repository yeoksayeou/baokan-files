Japanese theater troupe leader, deputy leader, and other leaders of the troupe, spoke freely to reporters in Guangzhou on the 7th about their impressions of China's various construction endeavors, and also discussed further consolidating and developing the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, as well as striving for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

The head of the theater troupe, Tomoyoshi Murayama, said that what moved us most during this visit to China was that the Chinese Communist Party and the government correctly applied Marxism-Leninism and creatively built their country in combination with China's specific conditions. The most prominent manifestation of this is the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. We have seen in various places the victories achieved by the three red banners on various fronts. He said that imperialists spread rumors that the Chinese people were subjected to forced labor. However, the actual situation we saw was not like that. We saw that the Chinese people are striving to carry out socialist construction. When talking about China's Great Leap Forward, Murayama said that what surprised us the most was the speed of your leap forward. This speed is unprecedented.

Deputy head Haruko Sugimura said that the Chinese people truly need a peaceful environment to build socialism. There was an ancient Japanese warrior named Taira no Kiyomori, who, in order to show his power, called back the setting sun. The Chinese people are like Taira no Kiyomori, wanting to call back the sun so that they can have more time for construction. China becoming a powerful socialist country is the happiness of all the people of Asia and the world.

When talking about their impressions of the development of Chinese literature and art, deputy heads Koreya Senda, Yasue Yamamoto, and Haruko Sugimura believed that they were surprised by the progress and achievements of Chinese culture and art, and that there were many things worth learning. They believed that the Chinese leaders are very concerned about and attach great importance to literary and artistic work, which is an important reason for the significant development of literary and artistic work. Koreya Senda said that reactionaries say that socialist countries have no individual development and no freedom of creation. However, the Chinese drama they saw carries out collective creation under the premise of serving the people, thus using various themes and artistic forms, so that many major events in real life can be reflected on the stage in a timely manner. All of this can only be realized in a socialist country.

Playwright and director Junji Kinoshita especially praised China's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy for literature and art, because it correctly inherits and develops national traditions while reflecting real life. He said that through this visit, he felt that his understanding of China was too superficial. One of our young actors said, "We need to use a large crane to move all the Japanese people to China to let them see." There is no such a huge crane, but we want to play the role of this crane. After returning to Japan, we must tell the Japanese people what we have seen in China so that they can have a clearer understanding of today's China. When talking about the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, deputy head Osamu Takizawa and other leaders of the theater troupe expressed their gratitude for the Chinese people's support for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. They said that cultural exchanges between China and Japan have a long history. However, this cultural exchange and the friendship between the two peoples have been undermined by the anti-China and pro-U.S. reactionaries, and in the future, we must continue to fight against the forces that undermine the development of friendship between the two peoples. They believed that the development of cultural exchanges and the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people must be based on the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. In order to develop the friendship between the two peoples and restore diplomatic relations between the two countries, we must act in accordance with the three political principles put forward by Premier Zhou Enlai.

    日本话剧团领导人谈访华观感
    中国三面红旗在各个战线上取得胜利
    强大的社会主义的中国是亚洲和世界人民的幸福
    日本话剧团团长、副团长和剧团的其他领导人，7日在广州向新闻记者畅谈了对中国各项建设事业的印象，并且谈到了进一步巩固和发展中日两国人民的友谊及争取早日恢复中日两国邦交等问题。
    话剧团团长村山知义说，我们这次访问中国，最使我们感动的，是中国共产党和政府正确地运用马克思列宁主义，结合中国的具体情况，创造性地建设自己的国家。最突出的表现，就是总路线、大跃进和人民公社的三面红旗。我们在各地已经看到了三面红旗在各个不同战线上取得的胜利。他说，帝国主义者散布谣言说中国人民被强制劳动。在我们看到的实际情况却不是这样。我们看到中国人民正在奋发有为地进行社会主义建设。在谈到中国的大跃进时，村山知义说，最使我们感到惊奇的，是你们的跃进的速度。这种速度是史无前例的。
    副团长杉村春子说，中国人民为了建设社会主义，是真正需要和平的环境。日本古代有一个武将叫平清盛，他为了显示自己的威力，把将要落山的太阳叫回来。中国人民正像平清盛一样，要把太阳唤回来，以便有更多的时间进行建设。中国变为强大的社会主义国家，是全亚洲和世界人民的幸福。
    在谈到对中国文艺事业发展的印象时，副团长千田是也、山本安英、杉村春子认为，中国的文化艺术的进步成就，使他们吃惊，有很多东西值得学习。他们认为，中国的领导人非常关心和重视文艺工作，是文艺工作获得显著发展的重要原因。千田是也说，反动派说社会主义国家没有个性发展，没有创作自由。但是他们所看到的中国的话剧，在为人民服务前提下进行集体创作，因而把各种题材各种艺术形式都运用起来，这样，就使许多现实生活中的重大事件，能够及时地反映到舞台上去。而这一切，都只有在社会主义国家里才有实现的可能。
    话剧团编导木下顺二特别赞扬中国的“百花齐放”的文艺方针，因为它既正确地继承和发扬民族的传统，又反映了现实生活。他说，通过这次访问，感到自己对中国的认识太肤浅了。我们当中有一个年青演员说，“要用一个很大的起重机，把全日本人民都搬到中国来，让他们看一看。”这种巨大的起重机是没有的，但我们要起这种起重机的作用。回到日本以后，要把在中国看到的东西转告给日本人民，让他们对今天的中国有更清楚的了解。在谈到中日两国人民的友谊时，副团长泷泽修和话剧团其他领导人都表示感谢中国人民对日本人民反美爱国斗争的支持。他们说，中国和日本的文化交流有着悠久的历史。但是这种文化交流和两国人民的友谊，受到日美反动派的破坏，今后必须继续同破坏两国人民友谊发展的势力进行斗争。他们认为，中日两国文化交流和两国人民友谊的发展，必须建立在恢复中日两国邦交的基础上。为了发展两国人民的友谊和恢复两国的邦交，必须根据周恩来总理提出的政治三原则办事。
