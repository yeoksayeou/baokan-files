Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, November 23rd: The West German "General-Anzeiger" yesterday retorted to the American demand that West Germany contribute more money to solve the American international payment crisis.

    The newspaper sarcastically said, "Today the dollar is no longer as hard as the Mark," and "this is not our fault."

    The "General-Anzeiger" complained that the United States has "some wrong ideas" about West Germany's "financial strength." It played poor, saying, "Although we (West Germany) have a payment surplus and so many gold and foreign exchange reserves, we are far from being a rich country." The newspaper said that West Germany "is still a very poor country compared to France and Britain, not to mention Switzerland and the United States." It said, "Excessive bloodletting will make our economic and monetary future bleak."

    The "General-Anzeiger" even took advantage of this opportunity for the United States to seek assistance from West Germany to openly demand that the United States return German property confiscated by the United States during the Hitler era to West Germany. It said, "Compared to the past, especially compared to our free world partners, we have only just regained some less foreign property. Therefore, it is precisely that the United States has so far not returned the majority of this property, which is inconsistent with the atmosphere of the Bonn talks."

    美元不如马克  马克不愿“放血”
    西德报刊对美国要求反唇相讥
    据新华社波恩23日电　西德“总汇报”昨天对美国要西德多出钱来解救美国国际支付危机的要求反唇相讥。
    这家报纸讽刺地说，“今天美元不再像马克那么硬”，“这并不是我们的过错”。
    “总汇报”埋怨美国对西德的“财政力量”“抱有一些错误看法”。它叫穷说，“虽然我们（西德）有支付顺差和这么多的黄金外汇储备，但我们还远远不是一个富裕的国家”。报纸说，西德“同法国和英国相比还是一个十分穷的国家，更不用说同瑞士和美国比”。它说，“过多的放血要使得我们的经济和货币前途暗淡”。
    “总汇报”甚至借这次美国来求助西德的机会，公开要求美国把希特勒时期被美国没收的德国财产交给西德。它说，“同从前比较，首先是同我们自由世界伙伴比较，我们也不过是刚刚又有了些较少的国外财产。因此，恰好是美国至今还没收着这笔财产的大部分，这是同波恩会谈的气氛不协调的”。
