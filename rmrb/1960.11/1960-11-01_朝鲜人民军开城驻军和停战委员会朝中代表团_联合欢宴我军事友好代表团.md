Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 30th. The Korean People's Army garrison in Kaesong and the Korean-Chinese side delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission jointly held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome their close comrades-in-arms, the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea.

Attending the banquet were Deputy Head of the Delegation General Luo Ruiqing and all members of the delegation.

Also attending the banquet were Vice Minister of National Defense of Korea General Choi Yong-jin, Commander of the Korean People's Army Garrison in Kaesong General Chuan Wenxie, Deputy Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army Major General Li Changshou, Chairman of the Kaesong Regional Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Wu Jailong, Chairman of the People's Committee Jin Minghao, and other party and government leaders. Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission Major General Zhu Changjun, Members Major General Ren Rong (Chinese People's Volunteer Army), Senior Colonel Li Zhenfan, Secretary-General Senior Colonel Lin Jiji, as well as Volunteer Army Mother Liu Mei, officers of the Korean People's Army garrison in Kaesong, and Heroes of the Republic also attended the banquet.

Also invited to the banquet were Major General Kunizki of the Polish delegation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and Major General Shile of the Czechoslovak delegation.

General Chuan Wenxie delivered a speech first, welcoming the distinguished Chinese guests. He said that the people and armies of Korea and China have formed the closest relationship of comrades-in-arms through a long and arduous struggle against common enemies. This traditional friendship and unity between our two peoples and armies was further consolidated and developed during the Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of US imperialism and its lackeys. He said that the Chinese people's movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea is a manifestation of the brotherly Chinese people's love for our people and an example of proletarian internationalism. Our People's Army officers and soldiers and the brave warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers once shared life and death in the same trench, sharing weal and woe, and fighting the enemy with one heart and one mind. Because of the great strength of our unity, the US imperialist aggressors suffered a shameful and disastrous defeat in their history, and they had to sign the armistice agreement in Kaesong, the place where they launched their war of aggression.

He said that the closely united people of Korea and China have achieved great successes in socialist revolution and socialist construction with mutual assistance. Standing on the eastern outpost of the socialist camp to defend this achievement, the armies of our two countries have grown into invincible modern revolutionary armed forces. He said that our People's Army officers and soldiers are happy to see the brilliant achievements made by the brotherly Chinese people and the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the struggle to build and defend socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, and regard them as their own achievements.

Quan Wenxie condemned the US imperialist aggressors for not learning the lessons of their disastrous defeat in the Korean War, still occupying southern Korea and Taiwan, and frantically carrying out war conspiracies. He said that in the common struggle to thoroughly defeat the US imperialist aggressors, defend peace in the Far East and the world, and strive for the victory of socialism, we will always stand together with the Chinese people and the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He emphasized that the traditional friendship and the strength of unity between the people and armies of Korea and China cannot be defeated by any enemy. The great Korean-Chinese friendship will last forever!

General Luo Ruiqing then delivered a speech at the banquet. He first expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the hosts for their welcome and hospitality, and extended his lofty respect and cordial greetings to the heroic Korean people and the People's Army units guarding the eastern outpost of socialism, and to all the comrades of the Korean-Chinese side delegation who are working hard to resolutely maintain the Korean Armistice Agreement. He said: "Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army have waged a resolute struggle against the US imperialist aggression, and together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, jointly crushed the US imperialist aggression, forcing it to sign the armistice agreement in Panmunjom. This heroic action and great victory of the Korean people not only defended the freedom and independence of Korea, but also provided great support for our socialist construction, and was a great encouragement to all oppressed people around the world who are fighting against imperialist aggression and striving for national liberation and independence. The Korean War and the Korean armistice negotiations exposed the paper tiger face of US imperialism and showed the people of the world a truth: only by recognizing the aggressive nature of US imperialism and launching a resolute struggle against it can peace be achieved and effectively defended."

General Luo Ruiqing said: "The people of China and Korea have not only jointly defeated the armed aggression of US imperialism, but also, in the seven years since the armistice, have always cooperated closely and powerfully exposed and attacked various conspiracies of US imperialism to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and endanger peace in the Far East and the world, seriously frustrating the new war provocations of US imperialism."

General Luo Ruiqing praised the great achievements made by the Korean people in socialist construction and the glorious victories won by the Korean People's Army in the cause of army building and defending the motherland.

General Luo Ruiqing then condemned US imperialism for still occupying southern Korea, turning southern Korea into a dark hell on earth, and talked about the powerful anti-US struggle storm that broke out among the people of southern Korea this spring. He said that now, the Korean Workers' Party's great call for the peaceful reunification of the motherland has become increasingly popular, and all the Korean people are increasingly strongly demanding that US imperialism immediately get out of southern Korea. We firmly believe that the just struggle of the Korean people will surely achieve final victory, and the three thousand li of beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea will surely be reunified.

General Luo Ruiqing finally said: The people of China and Korea are close and friendly neighbors and brothers as close as limbs in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. In the struggle against the common enemy imperialism, we have forged a fighting friendship with blood, and in the cause of socialist construction and defending peace, we have always sympathized with and supported each other. We believe that this friendship of ours, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, will continue to be consolidated and expanded, and will be passed down from generation to generation and will last forever.

Tonight, the banquet hall was brightly lit, and large banners reading "Long live the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung!" and "Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!" were hung high on the front of the venue. During the banquet, the guests and hosts frequently toasted the fighting friendship forged with blood between the people and armies of China and Korea, and the invincible great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. General Luo Ruiqing also toasted "Volunteer Army Mother" Liu Mei on behalf of all members of the delegation, and through her, toasted all the mothers of Korea.

Before the banquet, the Korean People's Army Kaesong Garrison Ensemble performed wonderful programs for the delegation, including many Chinese and Korean music and dance programs. After the performance, General Luo Ruiqing and all members of the delegation went on stage, presented flower baskets to the performers, and shook hands with them one by one.

    朝鲜人民军开城驻军和停战委员会朝中代表团
    联合欢宴我军事友好代表团
    全文燮中将说朝中两国人民在共同的斗争中将永远站在一起
    罗瑞卿大将说朝鲜人民的英勇斗争是对中国建设的巨大支援
    新华社开城30日电　朝鲜人民军开城地区驻军和朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团今晚联合举行宴会，热烈欢迎亲密的战友——中国访朝军事友好代表团。
    参加宴会的有代表团副团长罗瑞卿大将和全体团员。
    朝鲜民族保卫省副相崔勇进上将、朝鲜人民军开城地区驻军首长全文燮中将、朝鲜人民军总政治局副局长李长秀少将、朝鲜劳动党开城地区委员会委员长吴济龙、人民委员会委员长金明浩等党政领导人参加了宴会。朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将、委员任荣少将（中国人民志愿军）、李贞范大校、秘书长林箕济上校，以及志愿军妈妈柳梅、朝鲜人民军开城地区驻军军官、共和国英雄等也参加了宴会。
    中立国监察委员会波兰委员库尼兹基少将、捷克斯洛伐克委员席列少将也应邀出席了宴会。
    全文燮中将首先致词，欢迎中国贵宾。他说，朝中两国人民和军队通过反对共同敌人的长期艰苦斗争，结成了最亲密的战友关系。我们两国人民和军队之间的这种传统友谊和团结，在反对美帝国主义及其仆从武装进攻的祖国解放战争时期更加巩固和发展了。他说，中国人民的抗美援朝运动，是兄弟般的中国人民热爱我国人民的表现，是无产阶级国际主义的榜样。我们人民军官兵和志愿军勇士们曾经在一个战壕里同生死，共患难，同心同德地对敌人作战。由于我们团结起来的伟大力量，美帝国主义侵略者在他们的历史上遭到了可耻的惨败，他们不得不在自己发动侵略战争的这个地方——开城，在停战协定上签字。
    他说，紧紧团结起来的朝中两国人民在互相协助下，在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设中都获得了巨大的成就。为了保卫这个成就而站在社会主义阵营东方前哨的我们两国的军队，已壮大成为战无不胜的现代化革命武装力量。他说，我们人民军官兵把兄弟般的中国人民和中国人民解放军官兵们在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下建设和保卫社会主义斗争中所取得的辉煌成就，看成是自己的成就，而感到高兴。
    全文燮谴责了美帝国主义侵略者并未记取在朝鲜战争中遭到惨败的教训，仍然强占朝鲜南部和台湾，疯狂地进行战争阴谋活动。他说，我们在彻底打败美帝国主义侵略者、保卫远东和世界和平、争取社会主义胜利的共同斗争中，将永远同中国人民和中国人民解放军官兵们站在一起。他强调说，朝中两国人民和军队的传统友谊和团结的力量，是任何敌人都战胜不了的。伟大的朝中友谊将万古长青！
    罗瑞卿大将在宴会上接着致词。他首先对主人的欢迎和招待表示衷心的感谢，并向守卫在社会主义东方前哨的英雄的朝鲜人民和人民军部队，向为坚决维护朝鲜停战协定而艰苦工作的朝中方面代表团全体同志致以崇高的敬意和亲切的问候。他说：“英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，同美帝国主义的侵略罪行进行了坚决的斗争，并同中国人民志愿军一起，共同粉碎了美帝国主义的侵略，迫使它在板门店签订了停战协定。朝鲜人民的这一英勇行动和伟大胜利，不仅保卫了朝鲜的自由独立，同时对于我国社会主义建设事业也是一个巨大的支援，对于全世界一切反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族解放和独立的被压迫人民，是一个莫大的鼓舞。朝鲜战争和朝鲜停战谈判，戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎的面目，向全世界人民说明了一个真理：只有认清美帝国主义的侵略本质，并向它展开坚决的斗争，才能获得和平和有效地保卫和平。”
    罗瑞卿大将说：“中朝两国人民不仅共同打败了美帝国主义的武装侵略，而且在停战以后的七年来，也始终紧密配合，有力地揭露和打击了美帝国主义破坏朝鲜停战协定、危害远东和世界和平的各种阴谋，严重地挫败了美帝国主义的新战争挑衅。”
    罗瑞卿大将赞扬了朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就和朝鲜人民军在军队建设和保卫祖国的事业中获得的光辉胜利。
    罗瑞卿大将接着谴责美帝国主义仍然霸占着朝鲜南部，使朝鲜南部变成一座黑暗的人间地狱，并且谈到了今年春天朝鲜南部人民所掀起的强大的反美斗争风暴。他说，现在，朝鲜劳动党关于和平统一祖国的伟大号召已经日益深入人心，全体朝鲜人民都在日益强烈地要求美帝国主义立即从朝鲜南部滚出去。我们坚信，朝鲜人民的正义斗争是一定会取得最后胜利的，朝鲜的三千里锦绣江山是一定会重新得到统一的。
    罗瑞卿大将最后说：中朝两国人民是亲密友好的邻邦，是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中情如手足的兄弟。在反对共同敌人帝国主义的斗争中，曾经用鲜血凝成了战斗友谊，在社会主义建设和保卫和平的事业中，我们也一贯互相同情、互相支援。我们相信，我们这种建立在马克思列宁主义原则上的友谊，将不断地得到巩固和扩大，并将世世代代流传下去，与世永存。
    今晚，宴会厅灯火辉煌，会场正面高悬着“以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府万岁！”“以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府万岁！”的大幅标语。席间，宾主频频为中朝两国人民和军队之间以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊、为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的不可战胜的伟大团结而干杯。罗瑞卿大将还代表代表团全体成员向“志愿军妈妈”柳梅，并通过她向朝鲜所有的妈妈祝酒。
    宴会前，朝鲜人民军开城驻军协奏团为代表团演出了精彩节目，其中有不少是中朝两国的音乐舞蹈节目。演出后，罗瑞卿大将和代表团全体团员登台，向演员赠送花篮，并同演员一一握手。
