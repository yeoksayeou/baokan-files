    Hubei Avoids Autumn Drought by Expanding Summer Grain Planting for High Yields and Increased Harvests
    Shaanxi Improves Autumn Planting Quality Striving for Balanced Production Increase

    This newspaper, Wuhan, 3rd: Hubei Province is conscientiously summarizing past agricultural production experiences, further grasping natural laws, and adjusting and deploying crops for each season of next year in accordance with local conditions and timing. At present, a production campaign centered on autumn planting, unprecedented in scale and momentum, has been launched in Hubei Province.
    More rain in spring and summer, and frequent drought in autumn are the climatic patterns of Hubei Province. Due to continuous autumn droughts lasting for dozens of days, the harvest of late autumn crops is very unreliable; while summer harvested crops and early rice, due to their early season and avoidance of autumn drought, have relatively stable yields; middle-season rice and early autumn grains such as spring sweet potatoes, spring corn, and spring soybeans are also less threatened by autumn drought. In recent years, the main reason for the annual increase in grain production in the Xiangyang Special District, where natural conditions are not very good, is that they have planted as many summer harvested crops and early autumn crops as possible based on the above patterns. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee comprehensively analyzed the province's natural conditions and crop growth patterns, and based on the experience of increasing production in the Xiangyang area, determined that the province should adopt the policy of expanding acreage and increasing yield, combining summer harvested crops and autumn harvested crops, and combining staple grains and miscellaneous grains (including both paddy and dryland crops) in grain production. It also called on all localities to conscientiously summarize local production experiences in implementing the "three combinations," arrange production in accordance with local conditions, and strive to get about 80% of the year's grain in hand before the end of August to avoid autumn drought and ensure a bumper harvest.
    The Provincial Party Committee's call immediately turned into action throughout the province. Starting from the various natural disasters and unfavorable factors that may occur, and based on local natural characteristics and crop growth patterns, various effective measures were taken to arrange production for this autumn and next year. The first is to vigorously expand the area of autumn planting. As early as July, while strengthening field management of late autumn crops, all localities vigorously reclaimed wasteland. In addition, the areas along the river and lake broke the planting habits of previous years and vigorously engaged in the cultivation of summer harvested crops in paddy fields; the mountainous areas adopted methods such as intercropping, interplanting, and mixed planting to strive for an additional season of grain. Therefore, the area of autumn planting in Hubei Province this year is larger than in any previous year. Jingzhou, Wuhan, Huanggang and other regions, where the area of autumn planting has always been small, have also significantly expanded the area of autumn planting this year compared to previous years. Secondly, while autumn planting is underway, crop stubble is being arranged to appropriately expand the planting area of early autumn crops. The characteristics of these crops are: early planting season, short maturity period, autumn drought has less threat to them, the yield is relatively stable, and at the same time, they can vacate stubble early for the next season's crops. Third, in response to the frequent autumn droughts, there are plans to plant more late autumn drought-resistant crops next year.
    In order to effectively guarantee a bumper harvest in every season next year, all localities are conducting in-depth investigations and research among the masses during the autumn planting work, comprehensively considering local seasonal, climatic, soil, water conservancy and other natural conditions according to different types of regions, and summarizing and promoting local effective advanced experiences. For example, Zhuxi County, located in the mountains of northwestern Hubei, in order to further grasp natural laws, conscientiously summarized the experience of Liaoyeh Lake Production Team of Fengxi Commune in harvesting an additional season of summer harvested crops. This team lives in high mountains with an altitude of more than 2,000 meters. Because they have understood the natural characteristics of high mountains, cold weather, and a short frost-free period, they boldly reformed the cultivation system and adopted the method of "digging two seasons with one hoe," that is, planting two or three kinds of summer harvested crops with different maturity periods at one time, or interplanting the next season's crops when hoeing the previous season's crops (corn) two or three times, expanding the multiple cropping area, and changing from one harvest a year to two harvests a year. The County Party Committee comprehensively promoted their experience. According to incomplete statistics, this county has 400,000 mu of autumn harvested crops in autumn planting, and intercropped and interplanted rapeseed, oats and other summer harvested crops. Jingzhou area, Wuhan, Huanggang and other areas, most of which are located in the Jianghan Plain, have found the key to accelerating agricultural production development by deeply mobilizing the masses, summarizing years of agricultural production and disaster resistance experience, and analyzing natural conditions and crop growth patterns.
    In order to make next year's production arrangements more realistic and to do a good job in the current autumn planting work, recently, party organizations at all levels have transferred tens of thousands of cadres to the production teams and production brigades to discuss with the masses and plant according to the team and the brigade, making overall arrangements. While looking forward and backward, and arranging stubble according to local conditions, all localities are also vigorously promoting the working style of the mass line, adhering to the implementation of policies, and doing a good job of "three guarantees" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing production, and guaranteeing investment) in this year's autumn planting in a pragmatic manner. Some counties in the Jingzhou area, relying on the masses and doing a good job of "three guarantees," have mobilized the enthusiasm of the brigades and members, further formulated overproduction plans, and are determined to win a greater victory in autumn planting, fire the first shot of continued leap forward next year, and lay a solid foundation for a full year of agricultural harvest.

    This newspaper, Xi'an, 3rd: In the wheat sowing movement, the people's communes in Shaanxi Province have grasped both the plains and the mountains; both the regular stubble and the replanted stubble; both the high-yield fields and the large fields, so that they promote each other, comprehensively improve the sowing quality, and accelerate the sowing progress.
    This year, the wheat sowing area in Shaanxi Province is the largest in history. The mountain plateau areas and replanted wheat have the largest increase in sowing area. In the past, the general situation of autumn sowing in Shaanxi was that wheat in the plains was planted better than in the mountains, and regular stubble was better than replanted stubble. This year, due to the early season and more late autumn, how to ensure the sowing quality of wheat in mountains and plains, replanted and regular stubble, high-yield fields and large fields has become a key issue in autumn sowing. Under the leadership of the Party, the people's communes in various places have determined the principle of planting mountains before plains, regular stubble before replanted stubble, dry land before paddy fields, and high-yield fields before large fields, and have properly arranged labor and animal power. Shangluo Special District in southern Shaanxi, Yan'an and Yulin Special Districts in northern Shaanxi, and Lantian, Lintong, and Sanyuan counties in Guanzhong have also widely organized cooperation and support between production teams and production brigades in mountainous and plain areas, and paddy and dry land, to complete the sowing task ahead of schedule and improve the sowing quality.
    In the past, the sowing time of replanted wheat in Shaanxi Province has been relatively long, and it is difficult to guarantee the sowing quality of late planting. This year, in order to improve the sowing quality of replanted wheat, the people's communes in various places in Shaanxi first concentrated their efforts to plant regular stubble wheat, and then concentrated their efforts to plant replanted stubble wheat. For example, Yanliang Commune in Lintong County plans to sow more than 100,000 mu of wheat this year, of which more than 80,000 mu is replanted stubble. The commune first organized the labor and animal power of the production teams with less regular stubble wheat to support the production teams with more regular stubble wheat. As a result, it took only two days to sow more than 20,000 mu of regular stubble wheat.
    This year, all parts of Shaanxi have focused on wheat high-yield fields in autumn sowing. High-yield fields account for more than 40% of the sowing area in the province. Each commune, production team and production brigade has high-yield fields. All localities have grasped the sowing quality of high-yield fields to make a model for large-field sowing and improve the sowing quality of large fields.
    At present, Shaanxi Province has completed about 65% of the planned area for wheat sowing. According to the recent results of inspections in various places on mountains and plains, high-yield and large fields, and regular stubble and replanted stubble, the wheat sowing quality has been comprehensively improved this year.

    湖北避开秋旱扩种夏粮高产多收
    陕西提高秋种质量力争均衡增产
    本报武汉3日电　湖北各地认真总结历年农业生产经验，进一步掌握自然规律，因地因时制宜地调整和部署明年各季作物。目前，湖北省规模空前、声势浩大的以秋种为中心的生产运动已经开展起来。
    春夏雨水较多、秋季多旱是湖北省的气候规律。由于秋旱连续几十天，使晚秋作物的收成很不可靠；而夏收作物和早稻则由于季节早、躲开了秋旱，产量就比较稳定；中稻和早秋杂粮如春甘薯、春苞谷、春黄豆等，受到秋旱的威胁也较小。最近几年，自然条件并不算好的襄阳专区，粮食生产逐年增长的主要原因，就在于他们根据上述规律尽可能多种夏收作物和早秋作物。湖北省委全面分析了全省自然条件和作物生长规律，根据襄阳地区的增产经验，确定全省在粮食生产上采取扩大面积与提高单产并举，夏收作物与秋收作物并举，主粮与杂粮并举（包括水、旱作物并举）的方针。并号召各地在贯彻“三个并举”中，认真总结当地的生产经验，因地制宜地安排生产，力争在8月底以前把约占全年80％左右的粮食拿到手，以躲开秋旱，确保丰收。
    省委的号召立即在全省变成了行动。各地从可能发生的各种自然灾害和不利因素出发，根据当地自然特点和作物生长规律，采取各种有效措施，安排好今秋和明年的生产。首先是狠抓扩大秋种面积的工作。早在7月间，各地即在加强晚秋作物田间管理的同时大力开荒。除此以外，沿江滨湖地区打破了历年种植习惯，大搞水田种夏收作物；高山地区则采取套种、间作、混种等方法，力争多收一季粮食。因此，今年湖北省秋种面积大于任何一年。历来秋种面积较小的荆州、武汉、黄冈等地区，今年的秋种面积也都较往年显著扩大。其次是在秋种的同时，安排好作物茬口，适当扩大早秋作物的种植面积。这些作物的特点是：播种季节早，成熟期短，秋旱对它们的威胁较小，产量比较稳定，同时又可为下季作物及早腾出茬口。第三，针对秋旱频繁的特点，计划在明年多种晚秋耐旱作物。
    为了切实保证明年季季丰收，各地在秋种工作中，深入群众调查研究，根据各类不同地区，全面考虑当地的季节、气候、土质、水利等自然条件，总结和推广当地行之有效的先进经验。例如，地处鄂西北大山区的竹溪县，为了进一步掌握自然规律，认真总结了丰溪公社辽叶湖生产队多收一季夏收作物的经验。这个队住在海拔二千多米的高山上，由于他们摸清了山高气寒、无霜期短的自然特点，大胆改革耕作制度，采取“一锄头挖两季”的办法，即一次种上两、三种成熟期不同的夏收作物，或者在前一季作物（苞谷）锄二、三道草的时候间种下一季作物，扩大了复种面积，变一年一收为一年两收。县委全面地推广了他们的经验。据不完全统计，这个县在秋种中已有四十万亩秋收作物，套、间种了油菜、燕麦等夏收作物。大部分地区处于江汉平原的荆州地区和武汉、黄冈等地区，通过深入发动群众，总结了多年农业生产和抗灾经验，分析了自然条件和作物生长规律，从而找到了加快农业生产发展的关键。
    为了使明年生产安排更加切合实际，并抓好当前秋种工作，最近，各级党组织共抽调了数万干部深入到生产队和生产小队，跟群众一道商量，按队和小队因地种植，全面安排。在瞻前顾后、因地制宜地安排茬口的同时，各地还大兴群众路线的工作作风，坚持贯彻政策，实事求是地搞好今年秋种的“三包”（包工、包产、包投资）工作。荆州地区有的县由于依靠群众，搞好“三包”，调动了小队和社员的积极性，进一步制定了超产计划，决心夺取秋种的更大胜利，打响明年继续跃进的第一炮，为全年农业丰收打下雄厚基础。
    本报西安3日电　陕西省各人民公社在小麦播种运动中，既抓平川，又抓山区；既抓正茬，又抓回茬；既抓丰产田，又抓大田，使其相互促进，全面提高了播种质量，加快了播种进度。
    今年，陕西省小麦播种面积是历史上最多的一年。扩大播种面积最多的是山塬地区和回茬麦。陕西往年秋播的大体情况，是平川小麦种得比山区好，正茬比回茬好。而今年又由于节令早，晚秋多，因此如何保证山区平川、回茬正茬、丰产田和大田小麦的播种质量，就成为秋播中的一个关键。各地人民公社在党的领导下，确定了先山区后平川、先正茬后回茬、先旱地后水地、先丰产田后大田的原则，妥善安排了劳力和畜力。陕南商雒专区、陕北的延安、榆林专区和关中的蓝田、临潼、三原等县，还广泛地组织了山区和平川，水地和旱地的生产队、生产小队之间的协作支援，提前完成播种任务，提高播种质量。
    历年来陕西省回茬小麦的播种时间都较长，而且种得迟的，播种质量难以保证。今年，陕西各地人民公社为了提高回茬小麦播种质量，先集中力量种正茬麦，再集中力量种回茬麦。如临潼县阎良公社今年计划播种小麦十万多亩，其中八万多亩是回茬麦。公社首先组织正茬麦少的生产队的劳力和畜力，支援正茬麦多的生产队，结果只用了两天时间，就把二万多亩正茬麦播种完毕。
    陕西各地今年在秋播中，大抓小麦丰产田，全省小麦丰产田占播种面积的40％以上，每个公社、生产队和小队都有丰产田。各地都抓紧了丰产田的播种质量，为大田播种做出样子，提高大田的播种质量。
    目前，陕西省小麦播种已完成计划面积的65％左右。根据最近各地对山区和平川、丰产和大田、正茬和回茬检查的结果，今年小麦播种质量获得了全面提高。
