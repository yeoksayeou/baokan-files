    Go to the Most Difficult Place
    Zeng Xiang, Zheng Fu, Li Gangsheng

    More than a hundred *li* from the center of the capital, a motorcade travels day and night. Their task is to transport materials for the capital's industry. The story I am about to tell takes place in this transportation team. The protagonists are Communist Party members Wang Yunshan, Song Ruchun, and a group of young drivers.

    Not long ago, one evening, the Second Squad of the Changxindian Motor Vehicle Depot of the Beijing Transportation Company held a cadre meeting. At the meeting, the Party Branch Secretary mentioned that the First Squad had not been completing its tasks well recently, and hoped that everyone would discuss and come up with solutions to help the squad catch up with the advanced level. At the time, Wang Yunshan, the captain of the Youth Red Flag Squad who was present at the meeting, began to think it over repeatedly.

    The First Squad was only established in April of this year and consisted entirely of new drivers with only 3 or 4 months of training. Since its establishment, the squad has consistently failed to meet its planned targets. In order to help the squad change its backward appearance as soon as possible, the organization had sent Wang Yunshan to them three times to hold meetings and discuss ways to improve their work. Meetings were held, but the results were not significant. After being reminded by the Party Branch Secretary, Wang Yunshan felt that he had not completed the task assigned to him by the Party. He secretly asked himself, "Does admitting that I didn't handle this matter well mean that's the end of it? No, I can't do that. I'll ask the organization to transfer me there and try again!" As the meeting was about to end, he shared his thoughts with everyone.

    The meeting adjourned. Although the matter had not yet been finalized, Wang Yunshan had made up his mind. After returning home, he told his wife, "I've requested a job transfer again." His wife said, "Aren't you doing well in the Youth Squad?" "Yes!" Wang Yunshan said, "The Youth Squad is a Red Flag Squad. People are familiar, and the vehicles are in good condition, making it easier to work. But if you only work where it's easy and easy to achieve results, what kind of Communist Party member are you?"

    Soon, Wang Yunshan's request was approved. Along with him to the First Squad was Song Ruchun, an advanced producer and deputy captain of the Fourth Squad. They took on the roles of captain and deputy captain, respectively. Their shared desire was: how to change the face of this squad more quickly.

    In the beginning, Wang Yunshan and Song Ruchun were busy from morning till night, talking to one person and helping another repair their vehicles. However, problems still arose every day. Some vehicles could not be dispatched on time, some vehicles only made one trip overnight, and a few individuals did not return from their days off on time.

    At night, some people were out driving, while others were asleep. Wang Yunshan and Song Ruchun were sitting in the courtyard talking, as usual. Song Ruchun said, "What can we do to make our squad improve faster?" Wang Yunshan said, "We can't rush this! You see, many of the drivers used to be rickshaw workers or cart pullers, and they've only recently transferred to state-owned enterprises. I think the important thing is to follow the instructions the Party branch gave us before we came: after arriving, we must rely on the masses, especially the advanced elements." After some consideration, they realized that Ren Changde, the driver of vehicle number 69, was quite good. Although he was a new driver like everyone else, he often completed his tasks. However, his fuel-saving targets were not very good. Therefore, they decided to immediately focus on helping Ren Changde and use him to motivate the others.

    The next day, Wang Yunshan and Song Ruchun spoke with Ren Changde separately and helped him summarize his experiences and inspect his vehicle. With their help, Ren Changde and his co-driver, Hou En, became increasingly motivated. Not only did they complete their transportation tasks well, but they also became the "top performers" in the squad in terms of fuel saving. Wang Yunshan and Song Ruchun immediately published his achievements in a big-character poster. This big-character poster caused a great stir in the squad. Then, they had Ren Changde introduce his experiences at the squad meeting, launching a debate on whether new drivers could complete their tasks.

    Ren Changde's experience can be summarized as follows: first, check diligently, repair small problems with the vehicle early to prevent big problems; second, drivers on different shifts should cooperate well; and third, seize the time to drive. These were not things that new drivers could not do at all. After listening to his explanation, everyone became motivated and said, "Whether the plan is completed well or not is not entirely a technical issue, it mainly depends on whether we make every effort to overcome difficulties." "If people are diligent and the vehicle is not lazy, as long as we do as Ren Changde does, new drivers can still complete their tasks." As a result, everyone's enthusiasm increased, and new atmospheres emerged one after another. Now, people are striving to dispatch vehicles even if it means repairing them until midnight. Once, a part on the vehicle driven by Wang Chunlai broke down and he couldn't drive it. He wanted to replace it, but the team didn't have one. Undeterred, he was determined to dispatch the vehicle and eventually rode his bicycle more than forty *li* to borrow the part and replace it, enabling the vehicle to return to the front line.

    Wang Yunshan and Song Ruchun also kept in mind another instruction from the Party: they must set an example in everything. Since arriving at the First Squad, the two of them had divided into day and night shifts, not only driving like the other drivers, but also helping everyone troubleshoot. Sooner or later, people could always see them lying under the vehicle or squatting beside it, helping everyone inspect and repair the vehicles. They would never dispatch their vehicles or return to the dormitory to rest until all the squad's vehicles were dispatched.

    One night at two o'clock, Wang Yunshan was sleeping when a driver called from eighteen *li* away, saying that his vehicle had a problem and couldn't be started. He had tried to repair it himself for a long time but couldn't fix it. Wang Yunshan rushed to the scene and saw that the vehicle didn't have a major problem. It was just that the position of a wire end had shifted slightly. With a slight movement of a screwdriver, the problem was solved. Through this incident, Wang Yunshan realized that in order to completely change the face of the squad, he also needed to help everyone improve their skills. They turned the dormitory and parking lot into classrooms, using the evenings to give everyone technical lessons. If someone's vehicle had a problem, they would teach and repair it on the spot. A wave of enthusiasm for learning technology quickly emerged throughout the team. If they didn't understand, they asked; if they didn't know how, they learned; if they didn't do it right, they started over. The technical level of the entire team quickly improved significantly. Subsequently, the two of them also guided everyone to develop the habit of maintaining vehicles as they went along, making frequent inspection, maintenance, and cleaning a system. Because the number of cases where vehicles couldn't be dispatched due to minor problems decreased, the entire squad had a more reliable guarantee for completing the production plan.

    Two months have passed, and the production of the First Squad is flourishing. The high production record from two months ago is now the general level; many people have caught up with the level of the "model workers" in the entire depot. In September, they overfulfilled the monthly plan by 17%, reduced fuel consumption by more than 30% compared to the quota, eliminated accidents, and won the championship in the league of more than a dozen squads.

    到最困难的地方去
    增祥  郑福　李刚生
    在离首都市中心百里以外的地方，有一支汽车队日日夜夜奔驰着。他们担负的任务是为首都工业运送材料。这里所讲的故事，就发生在这支运输队里。主人公是共产党员王云山、宋汝纯和一群年轻的司机。
    不久以前的一个晚上，北京市运输公司长辛店汽车场所属二中队开了一次干部会。在这个会上，党总支书记提到一件事：一小队最近任务又完成得不好，希望大家研究研究，想什么办法使这个队赶上先进水平。当时，到会的青年红旗小队队长王云山听了以后，便反复地考虑开了。
    一小队是今年4月才成立的，全是只经过3、4个月训练的新司机。小队成立以后，计划一直完成得不好。为了帮助这个队早日改变落后面貌，组织上曾三次派王云山去他们那儿，召开会议，研究改进工作的办法。会是开了，可是效果却不大。经党总支书记这么一提，王云山感到自己没有完成党交给的任务。他暗暗地问自己：“难道承认自己没把这件事办好就算完了吗？不，不能这样，还是请求组织上调我到那儿去，再试一试吧！”快散会的时候，他把自己的想法向大伙谈了出来。
    会散了。当时虽然事情还没有最后确定，可是，王云山的主意拿定了。回家以后，就对他妻子说：“我又要求调工作了。”他妻子说，“你在青年小队不是挺好吗？”“是啊！”王云山说，“青年小队是红旗小队，人熟，车子条件也好，工作起来是方便。可是，如果看哪儿工作好搞，容易搞出成绩来，就在哪儿工作，还算什么共产党员呢？”
    不久，王云山的请求被批准了。和他一同到一小队的还有先进生产者、第四小队副队长宋汝纯。他们分别担任了正、副小队长。两人心里的愿望是一个：怎么能更快地把这个小队的面貌改变过来。
    一开始的时候，王云山和宋汝纯一天忙到晚，不是跟这个谈话，就是帮那个人修车，可是，天天总会出一些问题。有的车不能按时出场，有的车虽然开出去了，一夜工夫才拉一趟，个别人公休不按时归队。
    晚上，别人有的出车，有的睡了。王云山和宋汝纯又像往常一样，坐在院子里谈上了。宋汝纯说：“想什么法子，能让咱们小队进步得快点呢？”王云山说：“这也不能着急呀！你想，司机里边不少人是三轮工人、大车工人，刚转到国营企业来不久，我看要紧的还是按照临来前党支部给咱们的指示：去了之后，一定要依靠群众，特别是先进分子。”经过他们俩一琢磨，就发现六十九号车的司机任长德很不错，虽然他跟大伙一样是新司机，但经常能完成任务。只是节油指标完成得不太好。于是，他们商定，立即下力量帮助任长德，通过他来带动其他人。
    第二天，王云山和宋汝纯分别跟任长德谈了话，并且帮助他总结了自己的经验和检查了车辆。经他们这一帮助，任长德和同车司机侯恩劲头就越来越足了。不仅运量任务完成得好，在节油方面也成了小队“拔尖”的。王云山和宋汝纯立即用大字报把他的成绩公布出去。这张大字报在小队里引起了很大的震动。接着，他们就让任长德在小队会上介绍经验，发动大伙辩论新司机能不能完成任务？
    任长德的经验概括起来不外这样几点：一是勤检查，车辆有小毛病早点修，防止大毛病；二是上下班司机协作好；三是抓紧时间行车。这些，并不是新司机完全作不到的事情。听他这一讲，大伙劲头来了，人们说：“完成计划好不好，不全是技术问题，主要看是不是千方百计克服困难。”“人勤车不懒，只要照任长德这样干，新司机照样可以完成任务。”这一来，大伙干劲倍增，新气象接连出现。现在修到半夜也要争取出车。一次，司机王春来开的车坏了一个零件不能开了，想换一个队里又没有。他不灰心，一定要出车，最后骑自行车跑到四十里以外，借来零件换上，使车子重返前线。
    王云山和宋汝纯还牢记着党的另一个指示：必须处处以身作则。从到一小队不久，两个人就分成日夜班，不仅和司机一样去开车，还帮助大伙排除故障。早早晚晚，人们总可以看见他们躺在车下，或蹲在车旁，帮助大家检修车辆。小队的车子不出齐，他们绝不出车或回宿舍休息。
    一天夜里两点，王云山正在睡觉，一个司机从十八里路以外打来电话，说车子出了毛病，发动不着了，他自己修了半天修不好。王云山急忙赶到现场一看，车子没大毛病，只是一个线头的位置有点移动，用改锥稍微一动，问题就解决了。通过这件事，王云山想到要彻底改变小队的面貌，还需要帮助大家提高技术。他们就把宿舍、停车场变成课堂，利用晚上的时间给大家讲技术课。赶上谁的车出了毛病，他们就在现场边教学，边修理。全队迅速出现了人人学技术的热潮，不懂就问，不会就学，作得不对再从头来。全队的技术水平很快地提高了一大步。随后他们俩又引导大家养成随手保修车辆的习惯，使勤检查、勤保养、勤清洗形成制度。因为小毛病不能出车的情况减少了，全小队完成生产计划有了更可靠的保证。
    两个月过去了，一小队的生产蒸蒸日上。两个月前的高产纪录，现在成了一般的水平；许多人赶上了全车场“标兵”的水平。9月份，他们超额17％完成了月计划，耗油量比定额降低30％以上，消灭了事故，在十几个小队的联赛中获得了优胜。
