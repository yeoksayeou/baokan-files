Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 24th: The Central Committee of the Australian Communist Party issued a statement on the 21st, opposing the economic measures taken by the Menzies government last week to serve the monopoly capitalists.

It is reported that Australia is currently facing a severe economic crisis. The Menzies government's gold and pound reserves are declining sharply, with foreign exchange falling by £107.7 million since May this year.

Foreign trade has been greatly affected by the deterioration of the raw material market situation in the capitalist world. In order to maintain the high profits of monopoly capital and shift the burden of the crisis and military expenditure onto the workers, the Menzies government has decided to take measures such as tightening bank credit, raising overdraft interest rates, and increasing sales taxes on various vehicles.

The statement said that these measures represent the interests of the monopoly capital groups. These measures will lower the people's living standards and create unemployment.

The statement pointed out that along with these economic measures, political repression measures have also been taken. The Menzies government anticipated that with the deterioration of the economic situation, class struggle would intensify and sharpen, and therefore proposed the "Criminal Law Amendment Bill."

The statement called on the Australian people to continue the struggle against the "Criminal Law Amendment Bill" and similar anti-democratic measures, and to combine these struggles with economic struggles. It called on workers to strongly oppose the economic measures taken by the Menzies government, and to unite to fight for the following demands: reduce, restrict, and strictly control the profits of monopoly capital companies and the income of the wealthy; nationalize monopoly capital enterprises; reduce taxes on people with little or no income; abolish sales taxes and other forms of indirect taxes on necessities; raise wages and shorten the weekly working hours, etc.

The statement pointed out that the economic measures recently taken by the Menzies government cannot stop inflation or stabilize prices, but will only increase the economic burden on workers, farmers, and small business owners, and give monopoly capital more opportunities to brutally plunder the people.

The statement said that what exists in Australia today is the rule of monopoly capitalism, and all the measures taken by the Menzies government are to strengthen this rule.

The statement pointed out that the main factor that is driving up costs and prices in Australia today is the artificial price increases by monopoly capitalists to increase their profits.

The statement pointed out that while the government is suppressing wages and living standards, increasing the profits of monopoly capitalists, and accelerating the development of monopoly capital, it is also increasingly restricting the people's purchasing power. This policy can only promote the final outbreak of an economic crisis of overproduction.

The statement said, "The Menzies government has proven that it cannot solve Australia's economic problems. In fact, no government in a capitalist country can solve these problems, which arise from the private ownership of the means of production and the capitalist system of exploiting the working class. In the final analysis, only socialism can solve these problems. The rapid development of production and the rising living standards in socialist countries without crises prove this point."

### 反对政府将经济危机困难转嫁于劳动人民  澳共号召工人粉碎垄断资本的进攻

    反对政府将经济危机困难转嫁于劳动人民
    澳共号召工人粉碎垄断资本的进攻
    新华社24日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党中央委员会21日发表声明，反对孟席斯政府在上星期采取的为垄断资本家效劳的经济措施。
    据报道，澳大利亚目前正面临严重的经济危机，孟席斯政府的黄金和英镑储备正急剧下降，外汇从今年5月开始已下降了一亿零七百七十万镑。
    对外贸易由于资本主义世界原料市场状况的恶化而受到很大影响。孟席斯政府为了维持垄断资本的高额利润并把危机和军事费用的负担加在工人身上，决定采取紧缩银行信贷、提高透支利率，提高各种车辆的销售税等措施。
    声明说，这些措施是代表垄断资本集团利益的措施。这些措施将使人民生活水平下降，并造成失业。
    声明指出，在采取这些经济措施的同时，还采取了政治镇压措施。孟席斯政府预料到，随着经济局势的恶化，阶级斗争将要加剧和尖锐化，因此提出了“刑法修正案”。
    声明号召澳大利亚人民继续进行反对“刑法修正案”以及类似的反民主措施的斗争，并把这些斗争同经济斗争结合起来。它号召工人有力地反对孟席斯政府所采取的经济措施，并且联合起来为争取实现下列要求而斗争：削减、限制和严格控制垄断资本公司的利润和富人的收入；把垄断资本企业收归国有；削减对收入较少或很少的人们的捐税；废除销售税和必需品的其他形式的间接税；提高工资和缩短每周工作时数等。
    声明指出，孟席斯政府最近采取的经济措施不能制止通货膨胀或稳定物价，而只会增加工人、农民和小工商业者的经济负担，并使垄断资本获得残酷掠夺人民的更多的机会。
    声明说，我们澳大利亚今天存在的是垄断资本主义的统治，孟席斯政府所采取的一切措施都是为了加强这种统治。
    声明指出，使澳大利亚今天费用和价格上涨的主要因素就是垄断资本家人为地提高价格以增加他们的利润。
    声明指出，政府一方面压低工资和生活水平，增加垄断资本家的利润，加速垄断资本的发展，另方面却愈来愈限制人民购买力，这种政策只能促进生产过剩的经济危机的最后爆发。
    声明说，“孟席斯政府已经证明它无法解决澳大利亚的经济问题。事实上，没有一个资本主义国家的政府能够解决生产手段私有制和对工人阶级进行剥削的资本主义制度本身所产生的这些问题。归根到底，只有社会主义才能解决这些问题。社会主义国家在没有危机的情况下的生产飞速发展以及生活水平的蒸蒸日上证明了这一点”。
