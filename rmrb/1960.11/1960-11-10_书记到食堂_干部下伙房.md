    “Sharing a table for drinks, sleeping with feet touching,” these two phrases are used to describe the intimate and deep friendship between two people.
    We have always valued contact with the masses, but implementing "the secretary goes to the canteen, cadres go to the kitchen" has brought us a step closer to the masses, with our hearts even closer.
    The past "sharing a table for drinks" referred to the private friendship between two people. Now, "the secretary goes to the canteen, cadres go to the kitchen" refers to the deep friendship and love within our great collective.
    Individual life based on the family unit, the quality of food, and the quality of life arrangements directly involve the issues of each family. Now, dozens or hundreds of people share one stove. The quality of the food and the quality of life arrangements directly involve a collective. This requires us to put in more effort and hard work in this area.
    It is very different to care about the lives of the masses from outside the masses' lives and to care about the lives of the masses while living in the masses' lives.
    Caring about the lives of the masses from outside the masses' lives, no matter how strong your subjective wishes are, it is inevitable that you will not feel deeply or understand thoroughly. Living in the lives of the masses is another matter entirely: you know all the sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, and salty. When the food is good, you share the joy with the masses; when the food is bad, you feel it deeply. In short, you achieve a harmonious, closely related emotion with the masses.
    It is also very different to improve the lives of the masses from outside the masses' lives and to improve the lives of the masses while living in the masses' lives.
    Caring to improve the lives of the masses from outside the masses' lives, no matter how carefully you think or how clever the method, it is inevitable that to a certain extent, or to a great extent, it will be subjective, and to a certain extent, or to a great extent, it will miss the point. Living in the lives of the masses is another matter entirely. Your plans, facilities, and methods can be more specific, practical, and feasible. If you want to change a pear, you have to taste the pear. If you want to effectively improve the lives of the masses, you have to experience it firsthand.
    The act of the secretary going to the canteen and the cadres going to the kitchen itself is an encouragement and a driving force for the masses.
    "Someone said: 'The new cook is the county party secretary.' Aunt Wang said, 'No way, would the county party secretary touch the edge of the pot for the farmers?' Communist Youth League member Ma Jixiu refuted Aunt Wang's old view:
  'How can the Communist Party cadres be compared to the past? Good leadership, strong labor, digging fields, accumulating fertilizer, cooking, all-rounders in both literary and military skills. Speaking of labor, hey! Aunt Wang, they are no worse than us.'" (November 2nd People's Daily)
    This vivid description, jumping off the page, illustrates a problem: the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the masses are like a pile of dry firewood. When the secretary or cadre strikes a match, it immediately bursts into flames.
    When everyone eats well and sleeps well, their energy is greater and their enthusiasm is higher. This is equivalent to providing the most reliable guarantee for the accumulation and enrichment of social wealth.
    We are closely united with the masses, overcoming countless difficulties and hardships, and winning one victory after another. We will further unite closely with the masses and will surely be able to accelerate forward in the direction of socialism and strive for the early arrival of communism.

    书记到食堂　干部下伙房
    骥解
    “同桌而饮，抵足而眠”，这两句话是用来形容两个人融洽无间，友情深厚的关系的。
    我们从来就是重视联系群众的，但是，实行了“书记到食堂，干部下伙房”这一条，使我们与群众的相处，百尺竿头，进了一层，心与心贴得更紧了。
    过去的“同桌而饮”，指的是两个人的私谊，现在的“书记到食堂，干部下伙房”，指的是在我们伟大集体之间的深交与友爱。
    以家庭为单位的个体生活，伙食的好坏，生活安排的好坏，其直接涉及的，毕竟是一家一户的问题。现在是几十人、几百人共一个灶头，伙食的好坏，生活安排的好坏，其直接涉及的，就是一个集体了。这就更需要我们在这方面付出力量和辛劳。
    站在群众生活之外去关心群众生活，同生活在群众生活之中去关心群众生活，大不相同。
    站在群众生活之外去关心群众生活，无论你主观愿望多么强烈，总难免是感受不深，体会不透。生活在群众生活之中，那就另一回事了：酸、甜、苦、辣、咸，你全都知道。伙食好了，你同群众同享欢乐；伙食坏了，你有切肤之痛。总之，取得了与群众合拍和谐，息息相关的感情。
    站在群众生活之外去改善群众生活，同生活在群众生活之中去改善群众生活，又是大不相同。
    站在群众生活之外去改善群众生活，无论你想得多么周密，办法多么巧妙，总难免在一定程度上，或很大程度上带有主观成分，总难免在一定程度上，或很大程度上隔靴搔痒，搔不着痒处。生活在群众生活之中，那就另一回事了。你的计划、设施、办法就比较能够具体、切实、可行。你要变革梨子，就得尝尝梨子的味道；你要有成效地改善群众生活，就得身历其境。
    书记到食堂，干部下伙房，这件事的本身，对群众就是一个鼓舞，一个推动的力量。
    “有人讲：‘新来的炊事员是县委书记’。王大妈说：‘那里，县委书记还会替农民摸锅边’，共青团员马吉秀，反驳了王大妈的旧观点：
  ‘共产党的干部哪能与过去相比，领导好，劳动强，挖田、积肥、做饭、文武全才，说起劳动，嘿！王大妈，人家不比咱差半点’”书记下了食堂，社员都说：“书记都和我们同甘共苦，我们干活，越干、越想、心越甜。”（11月2日人民日报）
    这节声音笑貌，跃然纸上的描写，说明了一个问题：群众的政治热忱、劳动热忱仿佛是一堆干柴，书记、干部在上面擦一根火，就立刻熊熊地燃烧起来。
    大家吃好了，睡好了，干劲也就大了，积极性也就高了。这就无异对积累与丰富社会财富，提供了一条最最可靠的保证。
    我们与群众紧紧在一起，历尽无数艰难困苦，赢得了一个胜利又一个胜利；我们进一步与群众紧紧在一起，也就一定能够沿着社会主义的方向加速前进，争取共产主义的早日到来。
