How to Prevent Wheat Rust?

Rust is a dangerous disease in the growth process of wheat. It can take away nutrients and moisture from wheat leaves, destroy leaf tissue, and in severe cases, cause premature leaf death, resulting in significant losses. Taking active measures to eliminate rust before winter is an important task in current wheat production.

Rust Disease Occurrence Pattern

There are three types of rust that harm wheat: stripe rust, stem rust, and leaf rust. The symptoms and occurrence patterns of these three types of rust are different. The spore clusters of stripe rust are the smallest, arranged in longitudinal rows, with the lightest color, appearing bright yellow; the spore clusters of stem rust are the largest, irregularly scattered, with the deepest color, appearing reddish-brown; the spore clusters of leaf rust are between stripe rust and stem rust in size, also irregularly scattered, and the color is between the two, appearing orange-red to brownish-red.

In China's main winter wheat producing areas, stripe rust is the most harmful. The occurrence of stripe rust requires a lower temperature, generally occurring most easily between 9 and 16 degrees Celsius. Because it is not resistant to high temperatures, most of the bacteria die in the plains after winter wheat harvest, and a small number of bacteria are blown by the wind to northern and alpine regions to harm spring wheat, or overwinter on self-sown wheat seedlings in these areas. In autumn, stripe rust bacteria are blown by the wind to the winter wheat areas in the plains, harming wheat fields. After entering winter, the bacteria lie dormant in the wheat leaf tissue, and continue to harm the wheat after it turns green the following spring. Therefore, areas where autumn seedlings frequently get sick, winters are warmer, and spring rainfall is abundant have a higher survival rate of rust bacteria, and the disease occurs earlier and spreads faster in spring. These areas are the focus of prevention and control and should be given special attention.

Stem rust can also be a devastating disease in years of large outbreaks. It prefers higher temperatures, developing fastest at temperatures between 18 and 25 degrees Celsius. In South China, due to the high winter temperatures, stem rust occurs in early-sown wheat fields as early as November and December, and enters a period of widespread occurrence in January and February. After the bacteria reproduce in these areas, they gradually spread northward with the wind. In winter, South China must first focus on prevention and control, which can not only ensure the safe growth of local wheat, but also greatly reduce the number of bacteria and reduce the impact on northern regions.

The temperature suitable for leaf rust development is between stripe rust and stem rust, at 15-22 degrees Celsius. Except for areas with excessively low winter temperatures and relatively dry springs, leaf rust bacteria can overwinter in most parts of China, and local overwintering sources become an important source of leaf rust in the coming year.

According to the above-mentioned rust occurrence patterns, and the large-scale prevention and control practices in various places in the past two years, taking various effective measures to eliminate rust before winter is the best strategy for rust prevention and control. This is especially a crucial measure for the most harmful stripe rust. This is because: First, a large number of investigations and observations have proved that the prevalence of stripe rust in China is closely related to the presence and severity of autumn seedling disease and the amount of overwintering bacterial sources. Second, after wheat seedlings develop rust, their tillering ability and root development are adversely affected. This will reduce wheat production next year. Third, rust on autumn seedlings is concentrated in early-sown wheat fields. Prevention and control before winter when wheat plants are short is more labor-saving, medicine-saving, and easier to operate than prevention and control after wheat plants grow taller. Therefore, we must seize the favorable opportunity of pre-winter rust eradication and vigorously prevent and control it.

Careful Inspection, Ruthless Treatment, and Good Pre-Winter Management

The key to pre-winter rust eradication lies in accurate inspection, early prevention, and thorough treatment. In recent years, Shaanxi Province has created a set of prevention and control methods mainly based on "soil burying and leaf cutting" for stripe rust, which has achieved remarkable results in production. The basis of this method is that the stripe rust bacteria on autumn seedlings are initially blown from distant summering areas, with a small density, and only a few wheat seedlings are infected, i.e., the "single diseased leaf" stage. The bacteria spores grown from single diseased leaves spread to nearby wheat seedlings, forming nests of diseased wheat seedlings in the field, called "disease transmission centers." After a few weeks, the disease transmission center continues to spread around, causing rust to occur in the entire wheat field. Therefore, we must start early, and when rust has just begun to occur, and there are only a few single diseased leaves in the field that have not yet formed disease transmission centers, or have just begun to form very few disease transmission centers, prevention and control should be carried out.

Currently, rust has already occurred, and the masses must be immediately organized to conduct a comprehensive survey according to the local wheat varieties and the timing of sowing. Classify and rank the wheat fields, insert markers, and quickly eliminate them. Pay special attention to checking areas with a history of disease, planting susceptible varieties, early sowing, and leeward and sunny low-lying areas.

For single diseased leaves or disease transmission centers of stripe rust, the method of artificial "soil burying and leaf cutting" can be used to eliminate them. If a single diseased leaf appears in the field, some wet soil should be shoveled on the spot and covered on the diseased leaf, patted firmly, and then cut off from the wheat leaf stem with a small shovel, which can prevent the bacteria from continuing to spread; then remove the wheat leaves within one foot of the diseased leaf to eliminate the bacterial source hidden in the wheat leaf tissue that has not yet grown disease spots. If a disease transmission center is found in the field, the area of removing surrounding wheat leaves should be expanded to three feet after burying and cutting the diseased leaves. In order to make the wheat grow well within the buried and cut area, more fertilizer can be applied. If prevention and control is carried out too late, the disease transmission center is large, and there are too many diseased leaves, making it inconvenient to bury and cut, drug prevention and control can be used. There are many drugs for prevention and control, such as sodium fluoride or sodium fluorosilicate aqueous solution, ammonium sulfate water, ammonium nitrate water, and salt water, which are all killers of rust. In addition, lime sulfur mixture, ferrous sulfate lime water, barium polysulfide, colloidal sulfur, para-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, as well as local and foreign medicines such as tea cake, lycoris radiata, and plant ash can also be used for prevention and control. Currently, the most abundant source of medicine in various places is sulfur. The method of mixing one part of 0.5-degree lime sulfur mixture with one part of local pesticide, or increasing the concentration of lime sulfur mixture to 0.8 degrees can be used to improve its disease prevention efficiency.

Stem rust and leaf rust should also be checked early and prevented and controlled in a timely manner. For the prevention and control of stem rust, according to the wheat growth and the development of the disease, pesticides can be used to first prevent and control early-sown wheat fields that have begun to have sporadic disease. For leaf rust, because the occurrence is very scattered, prevention and control can be carried out according to different situations; if it has occurred and may spread throughout the field before winter, causing harm to wheat seedling growth, immediate prevention and control is needed; if it has occurred, but the density is extremely small, and it is estimated that it will not be widespread before winter, prevention and control may not be carried out; for plots where the entire field has already been affected and caused harm, it is too late to carry out drug prevention and control, and no significant effect will be achieved. Attention should be paid to strengthening cultivation management to promote the growth and development of wheat plants to compensate for its nutrient consumption. (Xinhua News Agency)

    怎样防治小麦锈病？
    锈病是小麦生长过程中的一种危险的病害。它能夺取麦叶内的养分和水分，破坏麦叶组织，严重时，使麦叶提早枯死，造成重大损失。积极采取措施把锈病消灭在冬前，是当前小麦生产上的一个重要任务。
            锈病发生规律
    为害小麦的锈病有条锈、秆锈和叶锈三种。这三种锈病的病征和发生规律都不一样。条锈病的孢子堆最小，排成纵行，颜色最浅，呈鲜黄色；秆锈病的孢子堆最大，不规则的散生，颜色最深，呈红褐色；叶锈病的孢子堆大小介于条锈和秆锈之间，也是不规则的散生，颜色居于二者之间，呈桔红至棕红色。
    在我国冬麦主要产区，以条锈病的为害最严重。条锈病的发生需要较低的温度，一般在摄氏九—十六度最易发生。由于它不耐高温，在平原地带不能越过夏季，大部分病菌在冬小麦收获前后死去，少部分病菌随风吹到北方地区和高寒地区为害春小麦，或在这些地区的冬小麦的自生麦苗上越过夏天。到了秋季，条锈病菌又随风吹到平原地带的冬小麦区，为害麦田。入冬以后，病菌潜伏在麦叶组织内过冬，到明春小麦返青后，又继续为害。因此，凡是秋苗经常发病，冬季较暖，春季雨水较多的地区，锈菌的越冬存活率就高，春季发病早，蔓延快。这些地区就成为防治的重点，应当特别注意。
    秆锈病在大发生的年份，也往往是毁灭性的病害。它喜欢较高的温度，在摄氏十八—二十五度的气温下发展最快。华南地区由于冬季气温高，秆锈病在11月至12月间即在早播麦田发生，1、2月间进入普遍发生时期。病菌在这些地区发生繁殖后，随风逐步向北传播蔓延。冬季，华南地区要首先抓紧防治，这样不仅可以保障当地小麦的安全生长，也可以大大压低菌源数量，减少对北部地区的影响。
    适合叶锈病发展的温度，介于条锈与秆锈之间，为摄氏十五—二十二度。除冬季气温过低、春季又较干旱的地区外，我国大部地区叶锈菌都可越冬，当地越冬菌源成为明年发生叶锈病的重要来源。
    根据上述锈病发生规律，和近两年来各地大面积的防治实践证明，采取各种有效办法，把锈病消灭在冬前，乃是防治锈病的上策。特别对于为害最严重的条锈病，更是一项带有关键性的措施。这是因为：第一，大量的调查观察证明，在我国条锈病是否流行，与当地秋苗发病的有无和轻重、越冬菌源的多少，密切有关。第二，麦苗发生锈病后，分蘖能力和根系的发育都受到不良影响。这样就会使明年小麦减产。第三，秋苗的锈病都集中在早播的麦田，在冬前麦株矮小的时候防治比麦株长大后防治省工、省药、操作方便。所以，我们必须抓住冬前灭锈的有利时机大力防治。
          细查，狠治，把好冬前关
    冬前灭锈的关键，在于查得明，防得早，治得彻底。几年来，陕西省针对条锈病已经创造了一套以“埋土切叶”为主的防治方法，在生产上取得显著成效。这个方法的根据是，秋苗上的条锈病菌最初是由遥远的越夏地区吹来的，密度小，只有极个别的麦苗受到浸染，即“单片病叶”阶段。由单片病叶长出来的病菌孢子向附近的麦苗传播为害，在田里形成一窝一窝的病麦苗，叫做“传病中心”。再经过几个星期，传病中心继续向四周蔓延，会使整片麦田发生锈病。所以我们必须及早动手，在锈病刚刚开始发生，田间只有极少数单片的病叶尚未形成传病中心，或刚开始形成很少的传病中心时，就进行防治。
    目前，锈病已经发生，必须立即组织群众，根据当地种植小麦的品种、播种迟早等情况，全面进行普查。把麦田分类排队，插上标记，迅速扑灭。特别要注意检查历年发病，种植感病品种，早播，背风向阳的低洼地。
    对条锈病的单片病叶或传病中心，可采用人工“埋土切叶”的办法来消灭它。如果田间出现了单片病叶，应当就地铲些湿土盖在病叶上，拍实后，再用小铲从麦叶茎部把它切断，这样便能防止病菌继续扩散传播；然后把病叶附近一尺内的麦叶摘掉，把潜藏在麦叶组织里未长出病斑的菌源也一道消灭掉。如果田间发现是传病中心，在埋切病叶后，摘除周围麦叶的面积要扩大到三尺。为了使埋切范围内的小麦生长好，可以多施一些肥料。如果因防治较晚，传病中心较大，病叶数量太多，不便埋切，可以喷药防治。防治的药剂很多，例如氟化钠或氟矽酸钠的水溶液、硫铵水、硝铵水、食盐水等，都是对锈病的杀伤剂。另外也可以使用石灰硫磺合剂、硫酸亚铁石灰水、多硫化钡、胶体硫、对氨基苯磺酸，以及茶饼、石蒜、草木灰等土洋药剂进行防治。目前各地药源最多的是硫磺，可以采用零点五度石灰硫磺合剂一份加土农药一份混用，或把石灰硫磺合剂的浓度提高到零点八度等办法，来提高它的防病效率。
    对秆锈病和叶锈病也要及早检查，及时防治。对秆锈病的防治可以根据小麦生长情况和病情发展，用药剂先防治早播的已开始零星发病的麦田。对叶锈病，因发生很分散，可以根据不同情况进行防治；目前已发病，冬前可能蔓延全田，对麦苗生长造成危害的，需要立即防治，目前已发生，但密度极小，估计冬前已不可能普遍发生的，可以不进行防治，对于目前已经全田发病造成危害的地块，进行药剂防治为时已晚，收不到显著效果，应当注意加强栽培管理，促进麦株的生长发育，以弥补其养分的消耗。　（新华社）
