    Linter and Its Uses
    Cotton seeds have fibers of varying lengths. Most of the fibers are long and uniform. After being ginned by machines, they become cotton fibers for spinning, commonly known as lint. There is also a portion of short fibers, thicker at the base, sharper at the tip, lacking crimp, and darker in color (grayish-white to yellowish-brown). Their length is only about one-third of the long fibers. These fibers are called linter.
    Linter is an extremely useful treasure. It can be spun into coarse yarn, woven into flannelette, made into knitwear, used as wadding for clothing and bedding, medical cotton, and made into ropes and lamp wicks. Linter cellulose, after chemical treatment, can be used to manufacture rayon, artificial wool, tire cord fabric for car tires, film, celluloid, plastics, nylon, artificial glass, and high-grade paper. Therefore, it is an important raw material for the textile, chemical, and paper industries. Linter is also one of China's important export commodities.
    Using delinted cotton seeds to extract oil can increase the oil yield and reduce the impurity rate because the reduction of fuzz reduces the absorption of oil. After proper delinting, seed cotton is easier to identify good seeds from diseased, insect-infested, and infertile seeds, making seed selection easier and saving labor. Delinting cotton seeds removes insect eggs hidden in the fibers, making insecticide application more effective. At the same time, delinted cotton seeds are easier to enter the soil and take root after sowing, facilitating water absorption, cracking of the seed coat, and germination. Generally, they can germinate three to five days earlier than non-delinted cotton seeds.
    Currently, the main cotton varieties in China, such as Sizi cotton and Daizi cotton, contain about 15 jin of linter per 100 jin of cotton seeds. When seed cotton is ginned, a small portion of the linter is already mixed into the lint, but the vast majority remains on the cotton seeds. Using a conventional saw gin, three passes of delinting can yield 7 to 8 jin of linter per 100 jin of cotton seeds; four passes can yield about 10 jin; and five or six passes can yield 13 to 14 jin. For seed cotton, the number of delinting passes should be less than for cotton seeds used for oil extraction. If one pass is used, an average of 2 jin of linter can be obtained per 100 jin of cotton seeds. However, delinting seed cotton must be carried out under conditions that ensure the technology is appropriate, the cotton seeds are not damaged, and the germination of the cotton seeds is promoted.

### 短绒及其用途

    短绒及其用途
    棉籽上长着长短不同的纤维，大部分长而整齐，经过机器轧剥，这就是供纺纱用的棉纤维，通常叫做皮棉。还有一部分短纤维，基部较粗，末稍光锐，缺少拈曲，色泽也较深
  （灰白色到黄褐色），长度只有长纤维的三分之一左右，这种纤维称为短绒。
    短绒是一种极为有用的财宝。它可以纺粗纱，织绒布，制针织品，作衣被棉絮、医药用棉，制绳索、灯芯；经过化学处理的短绒纤维素，可以制造人造丝、人造毛、汽车胎的帘子布、胶卷、赛璐珞、塑料、尼龙、人造玻璃以及高级纸张。因此它是纺织、化工、造纸等工业的一种重要原料。短绒又是我国重要的出口物资之一。
    用剥过绒的棉籽榨油，因为减少了绒毛吸收油分，可以提高出油率，降低含杂率。留种棉籽适当剥绒后，容易识辨好籽和病虫籽，不孕籽，选种方便，节省劳力。棉籽剥了绒，清除了隐藏在纤维内的虫卵，用药物拌种后，杀虫效率更高。同时，剥掉短绒的棉籽，播种后容易入土扎根，便于吸水裂壳生芽，一般能够比不剥短绒的棉籽提早三、五天发芽。
    目前我国主要棉花品种如斯字棉和岱字棉，每百斤棉籽约含短绒十五斤左右。籽棉轧花时，少部分短绒已经混入皮棉中，绝大多数还留在棉籽上。用通常的锯齿剥绒机脱剥三道，每一百斤棉籽可取得短绒七、八斤，剥四道可得十斤左右，剥五、六道，可达十三、四斤。对留种棉籽，剥绒道数要比榨油棉籽少一些，如果剥一道，每百斤棉籽平均可得二斤短绒，但是留种棉籽剥绒一定要在有技术条件、不伤损棉籽、有利于棉籽发芽的前提下进行。
