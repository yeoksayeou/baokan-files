Xinhua News Agency, 29th. Lagos Dispatch: According to Western news agencies, more than three thousand Nigerian university students demonstrated in Lagos, the capital of Nigeria, on the 28th, shouting slogans such as "No British military bases in Nigeria!" to protest against the "Defense Agreement" signed between Britain and Nigeria.

    Students holding placards with slogans like "Down with the Defense Agreement!" and "Demand the implementation of a completely neutral foreign policy!" broke through police barriers and crowded into the Federal Parliament. When the police drove the students out of the parliament, the demonstrating students marched to the government offices to express their protest. The students participating in this demonstration came from the University of Ibadan, ninety miles away.

    The report said that the police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators and arrested some students.

    The so-called "Defense Agreement" between Britain and Nigeria was negotiated in London in May this year before Nigeria's independence and has recently been passed by the Nigerian Federal Parliament. This agreement, which Britain uses to control Nigeria militarily, stipulates that the British government will provide personnel to "assist" the staffing, administration, and training of the Nigerian armed forces. At the same time, British military aircraft have the right to use Nigerian civilian airports, etc.

    A spokesman for the Nigerian Student Union pointed out that Britain is trying to use this agreement to establish military bases in Nigeria.

    反对英国在尼日利亚设立军事基地
    尼日利亚三千大学生愤怒示威
    新华社29日讯　拉各斯消息：据西方通讯社报道，尼日利亚三千多名大学生28日在尼日利亚首都拉各斯举行示威，高呼“不许英国在尼日利亚设立军事基地！”的口号，反对英国同尼日利亚签订的“防务协定”。
    学生们拿着“打倒防务协定！”“要求执行完全中立的外交政策！”等标语牌，冲破警察设置的障碍，拥进联邦议会。当警察把学生们赶出议会时，示威的学生又走向政府的办公室去表示抗议。参加这一示威的学生，是从九十英里以外的伊巴丹大学赶来的。
    消息说，警察使用了催泪弹来驱散示威者，并且逮捕了一些学生。
    英国—尼日利亚间所谓“防务协定”是今年5月间尼日利亚独立前在伦敦开始谈判的，已在最近为尼日利亚联邦议会所通过。这个英国用来在军事上控制尼日利亚的协定规定，英国政府将提供人员“协助”尼日利亚武装部队的参谋、行政和训练工作，同时，英国军用飞机有权使用尼日利亚的民用机场等等。
    尼日利亚学生联盟的发言人指出，英国企图利用这个协定在尼日利亚设立军事基地。
