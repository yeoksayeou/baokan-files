(Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin) The Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, implemented the mass line, further deepened and meticulously carried out political and ideological work to everyone, and fully mobilized and utilized the enthusiasm and consciousness of the workers and masses. The entire plant, united as one, worked hard to strengthen itself. Since August, steel production has increased significantly month by month. The main technical and economic indicators of converter steelmaking have jumped to the forefront of the country. From August to October, the average daily steel production level increased by 56%; the first ten days of November increased by 82% compared to August; the number of new steel varieties trial-produced and produced in the first ten months of this year was thirteen times more than the total for the entire year of last year. At the same time, a lively situation emerged throughout the plant, from the Party committee to various departments and organizations at all levels, grasping ideology at every level, and everyone talking about politics. Therefore, this plant has become a red flag of comprehensive leap forward of Tianjin's steel front that achieves more, faster, better, and more economically.

Party organization secretaries taking the lead, leading cadres at all levels personally taking action, explaining the situation and assigning tasks to workers, and extensively talking to and making friends with workers, is an important experience for this plant to carry out deep and thorough political and ideological work. The Party committee has stipulated two systems: first, Party committee members should regularly hold forums with workers and talk to them; second, whenever the plant conducts any work or launches any movement, it must explain everything to the workers, that is, explain the situation, assign tasks, explain key points, explain difficulties, and explain methods. Since August, the entire plant has held more than ten general meetings of all employees, where the Party committee secretary explained everything to the employees and implemented the Party's instructions; leading cadres held even more forums to talk with workers. In this way, the workers and masses felt that the leaders trusted them, that they, like the leading cadres, were masters of the country and the enterprise, and that they were shouldering major responsibilities. They also understood the current situation, tasks, key points, difficulties, and methods, and had a clear understanding of what was happening. When the plant was doing well in completing production tasks, the Party committee educated employees to prevent complacency and relaxation, and when certain temporary difficulties arose in production, it promptly prevented the rise of fear of difficulties, nipping all kinds of incorrect ideas in the bud and greatly boosting the morale of employees. For example, some workers in the municipal-level model group, the Dai Guangyuan converter group, once developed a sense of pride, and signs of disunity appeared within the group. Party committee secretary Zhang Kuiyuan participated in three group meetings in this group, had heart-to-heart talks with the workers, and patiently enlightened them. The workers received a great education, strengthened their unity, and became more motivated. Since then, all their work has been at the forefront. Usually, the plant's leading cadres spend most of their time going deep into workshops, groups, and furnace platforms, participating in labor, talking with workers, understanding the situation, solving problems, and directing production. They have established deep feelings with the workers during labor. Therefore, they can deeply understand the ideological situation of the masses and help the masses solve problems.

Fully utilizing the organizational role of Party and League branches and the exemplary and backbone role of Party and League members, so that political and ideological work takes root in production groups, is also an important aspect of this plant's deep and meticulous political and ideological work. For example, the Party branch of the smelting workshop often analyzes the political, ideological, and production situation of each group, grasping both advanced groups and backward groups, and assigning key leading cadres to provide assistance. The Han Jiapeng converter group had long been unproductive in the past, mainly because the group workers felt that their technology was poor and lacked confidence in striving for the upstream. The Party branch secretary of the workshop went deep into this group, first helping the group leader establish the idea that even with low technology, one can strive for the upstream. He also participated in several group meetings to educate the workers to establish lofty ambitions. All the workers in the group set out a plan to learn from the Dai Guangyuan and Sun Jinqi groups, the benchmarks of the plant. Later, they went to the No. 2 Steel Plant to learn from the advanced experience of the Yang Desheng group, the city-wide benchmark for "no defective products from a thousand furnaces." After two months of hard work, their technical level was generally improved. They continuously overfulfilled the production plan and achieved excellent results of continuous steelmaking with no defective products from a thousand furnaces, and were rated as an advanced group on the city's steel front. Now, 98% of the groups in the plant have established Party group leaders as the core backbone force. Everyone cares for and helps each other politically and in life. The backbone of the groups – Party and League members – not only influence the masses with their exemplary actions, but also often come early and leave late, talk to the workers, and visit the homes of employees, both publicizing the Party's policies to the masses and reflecting the masses' wishes and requirements to the Party, becoming the confidants of the masses.

Caring for and cultivating veteran workers, and relying on veteran workers to educate new workers and young workers, is also an aspect of this plant's good political and ideological work. The No. 3 Steel Plant is one of the earliest converter steel plants in Tianjin, with a relatively large number of veteran workers. They have a relatively high class consciousness and resolutely implement the Party's policies and tasks. They are the backbone force in the factory and have a relatively high prestige among young workers. The plant's Party committee pays special attention to their progress politically, pays attention to cultivating them, and constantly improves their ideological awareness, while relying on veteran workers to educate and help young workers. Many veteran workers have been hired to give political lessons to new workers, using their own personal feelings to educate new workers. For example, when veteran worker Zhu Fengming of the electromechanical workshop gave political lessons to apprentices, he used concrete facts to compare the old and new societies, talked about his painful experiences as an apprentice in the old society, and educated new workers to love the Party and love socialism. The effect was very good.

    党团员个个都做党的政策传播人
    天钢三厂政治工作上炉前，调动了各方积极性，生产不断提高
    据新华社天津电　中共天津第三钢厂委员会在增产节约运动中，贯彻群众路线，进一步深入细致地把政治思想工作做到每一个人，充分调动和发挥了职工群众的积极性和自觉性。全厂上下团结一致，发愤图强，从8月份以来，钢产量逐旬逐月大幅度上升，转炉炼钢各项主要技术经济指标都跃居全国先进行列。从8月到10月三个月中，钢的平均日产水平增长了56％，11月上旬比8月份增长82％；每吨钢的生铁消耗从一千四百零四公斤降低到一千一百十六公斤；今年头十个月试制和生产的新品种钢，比去年全年的总和还多十三倍。同时，全厂还出现了一个从党委到各个部门、各级组织，层层抓思想，人人谈政治的生动局面。因此，这个厂成为了天津钢铁战线上一面多快好省全面跃进的红旗。
    党组织书记带头，各级领导干部亲自动手，向工人讲形势，交任务，广泛和工人谈心、交朋友，是这个厂把政治思想工作做得深透的重要经验。党委会规定了两条制度：一是党委委员要经常召开工人座谈会，和工人谈心；二是厂里无论进行任何工作，开展任何运动，都要向工人交底，即交形势、交任务、交关键、交困难、交办法。从8月份以来，全厂先后召开了十多次全体职工大会，由党委书记向职工交底，贯彻党的指示；领导干部和工人谈心的座谈会开得更多。这样，职工群众感到领导相信自己，感到自己和领导干部一样，都是国家和企业的主人，都担负着重大的责任，也明白了当前的形势、任务、关键、困难和办法，心中有数。这个厂在生产任务完成好的时候，党委教育职工防止自满松劲情绪，而在生产上出现某些暂时困难的时候，又及时防止畏难情绪的抬头，把各种不正确的思想消灭在萌芽状态，极大地鼓舞了职工的斗志。如市级模范小组、转炉戴光元小组的一部分工人一度滋长了骄傲情绪，组内出现了不团结的苗头。党委书记张魁元就在这个小组参加了三次小组会，和工人们促膝谈心，耐心启发，工人们受到很大教育，加强了团结，干劲更足，在这以后，各项工作都走在前面。平时，工厂领导干部用大部分时间深入车间、小组和炉台，一边参加劳动，一边和工人交谈，了解情况，解决问题，指挥生产，在劳动中和工人建立了深厚的感情。因此能够深入了解群众思想情况，帮助群众解决问题。
    充分发挥党团支部的组织作用和党团员的模范、骨干作用，使政治思想工作在生产小组扎根，也是这个厂深入细致地进行政治思想工作的重要方面。如冶炼车间党支部经常分析每个小组的政治思想和生产情况，既抓先进小组，又抓后进小组，并由主要领导干部分工进行重点帮助。转炉韩家朋小组过去生产上长期没有起色，主要是小组工人认为自己技术差，对争上游缺乏信心。车间支部书记就深入到这个小组，首先帮助小组长树立技术低也能争上游的思想，他又几次参加小组会，教育工人们树立雄心大志。全组工人订出了学赶本厂标兵戴光元、孙金琦小组的规划，以后，他们又到第二钢厂学习“千炉无废品”的全市标兵杨德生小组的先进经验。经过两个月的刻苦努力，技术水平普遍提高，连续超额完成了生产计划，并且取得了连续炼钢千炉无废品的优异成绩，被评为全市钢铁战线上的先进小组。现在，全厂有98％的小组建立了以党小组长为核心骨干力量，大家从政治上、生活上互相关怀、互相帮助。小组的骨干——党团员不仅以自己的模范行动影响群众，而且经常早来晚走，和工人们谈心，到职工家中访问，既向群众宣传党的政策，又向党反映群众的愿望和要求，成为了群众的知心朋友。
    关心和培养老工人，依靠老工人教育新工人和青年工人，也是这个厂做好政治思想工作的一个方面。第三钢厂是天津市最早的一个转炉炼钢厂，老工人比较多。他们阶级觉悟比较高，执行党的政策和任务坚决，他们是工厂中的骨干力量，在青年工人中也有相当高的威信。工厂党委就特别在政治上关心他们的进步，注意培养他们，不断提高他们的思想觉悟，同时依靠老工人来教育帮助青年工人。很多老工人被聘请给新工人讲政治课，用自己的亲身感受教育新工人。如机电车间老工人朱凤鸣在给徒工讲政治课时，用具体事实讲新旧社会对比，讲他自己在旧社会学徒时的痛苦经历，教育新工人热爱党、热爱社会主义，效果非常好。
