Getting to the Bottom of Situations, Implementing Policies Thoroughly
Qinghai Provincial Party Committee Convenes Production Team Branch Secretary Symposiums in Batches to Listen to Opinions, Explain Policies, and Assign Work

    Xining, November 11th (People's Daily) – Recently, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has convened symposiums in batches for Party branch secretaries of production teams to understand the situation, explain policies, and help production teams arrange production and life, getting to the bottom of situations firsthand, implementing the Party's policies directly, and directly assigning work.

    Since August, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee has convened symposiums in batches for Party branch secretaries of some production teams in agricultural areas, some production teams in pastoral areas, and some production teams in disaster-stricken areas. It has also convened symposiums for heads of youth reclamation farms and state-owned farms. After a period following these symposiums, the Provincial Party Committee directly convened some production team branch secretaries to report on their work and check on the implementation of various policies in the production teams. These meetings were all presided over by the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, with secretaries of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, relevant ministers and bureau chiefs of the Provincial People's Committee, and Party secretaries of relevant cities, counties, and communes also participating. At these symposiums, the focus was on studying the issue of the three-level ownership system based on production teams within the people's communes, the issue of leadership methods, and the issue of cadres participating in labor, and production and life were arranged team by team.

    The method used in these meetings was generally to have the branch secretaries report on the situation and raise existing problems or difficulties in their work. Then, leading cadres of the Provincial Party Committee would explain the policies and assign working methods. Leading cadres and branch secretaries would jointly analyze and study, frankly exchanging information, so that the Party's policies could be directly implemented at the grassroots level, and the grassroots situation could be directly reflected to the Provincial Party Committee. At the same time, because the leading cadres of relevant cities, counties, and communes also participated in the meetings, the spirit of the Party's policies could be consistently communicated from top to bottom. The branch secretaries were extremely satisfied with this kind of symposium, generally reflecting that it was a meeting combining "explaining policies" and "listening to policies," a meeting combining "assigning tasks" and "assigning methods." While accepting tasks, they learned policies and working methods, felt at ease, and had great confidence. This kind of meeting was, in effect, also an investigation and research meeting. During the meeting, the Provincial Party Committee drew a group of cadres from various units to form a meeting working group, assigning one or two dedicated personnel to each production team to conduct investigation and research, calculate detailed accounts of grain, production, and life. As soon as problems were discovered in the accounting process, solutions were immediately studied. All production teams further understood their own assets through accounting, and also exchanged experiences with each other. At the meeting, leading cadres and general staff fully respected the opinions of the branch secretaries. Consequently, the branch secretaries were able to speak freely, provide accurate information, and make practical and feasible measures and decisions. The meeting also wrote documents while conducting symposiums and research. After the meeting, the branch secretaries took the documents back to promptly communicate and implement them. Through this series of symposiums, each production team participating in the meeting wrote a relatively detailed investigation and research material, the main content of which included this year's grain output and distribution, and specific arrangements and plans for production and life this autumn and winter and next year. These materials were very helpful for the provincial leading organs to grasp the actual situation and guide grassroots work.

    The Provincial Party Committee's leadership method of directly grasping production teams has also led various counties and communes to attach greater importance to the leadership of production teams. Recently, leading cadres from Hualong, Huangyuan, Ledu and other counties have convened production team symposiums in batches to practically arrange work team by team and solve specific problems one by one.

    Because leadership over production teams has been strengthened from the province to the communes, it has helped production team cadres improve their policy level and improve their working methods. Many of the Party's policies have also been relatively quickly conveyed to the masses through grassroots cadres, turning them into the actions of the masses, and creating a new atmosphere in grassroots work throughout the province. According to the situation reported by a group of production team branch secretaries recently convened by the Provincial Party Committee, these teams have all implemented the spirit of the symposium.

    情况一摸到底　政策一通到底
    青海省委分批召开生产队支部书记座谈会倾听意见讲明政策交代工作
    本报西宁11日电　中共青海省委最近一个时期分批召集了生产队党支部书记座谈会，了解情况，交代政策，帮助生产队安排生产和生活，把情况一手摸到底，党的政策一竿子插到底，工作直接布置到底。
    8月份以来，中共青海省委分批召开了农业区部分生产队、牧业区部分生产队、部分受灾地区生产队党支部书记的座谈会，还召集了青年垦荒农场、国营农场负责人等座谈会。在座谈以后经过一段时间，省委又直接召集一些生产队的支部书记汇报工作，检查各项政策在生产队贯彻执行的情况。这些会议，都由省委第一书记主持，省委书记处的书记和有关部长，省人民委员会的有关厅长、局长和有关市、县、公社党委书记也都参加。在这些座谈会上，着重研究了人民公社以生产队为基础的三级所有制的问题，领导方法的问题和干部参加劳动的问题，并且逐队安排了生产和生活。
    这些会议的开法，一般都是先由支部书记汇报情况，提出工作中存在的问题或困难，然后省委领导干部讲解政策，交代工作方法。领导干部和支部书记共同分析研究，上下互相交底，使党的政策直接贯彻到基层，基层的情况也直接反映到省委。同时，因为有关的市、县、公社的领导干部也参加了会议，党的政策精神能够上下一气贯通。支部书记对这种座谈会极为满意，普遍反映这是“讲政策”与“听政策”结合的会，“交任务”与“交方法”结合的会，他们在接受任务的同时，学到了政策和工作方法，感到心里踏实，信心很足。这种会议实际上又是调查研究会，会议中省委从各单位抽调了一批干部，组成会议工作组，给每个生产队配备了一至两个专人，分队作调查研究，算粮食、生产和生活细账，在算账中一发现问题，就立即研究解决办法。各生产队都通过算账进一步了解了自己的家底，也互相交流了经验。会上不论领导干部和一般工作人员都充分尊重支部书记意见，因而支部书记都能畅所欲言，提供的情况准确，作出的措施和决定切实可行。会议还边座谈、边研究、边写文件，会议结束，支部书记便把文件带回去及时传达和贯彻执行。通过这样一系列的座谈会，参加会议的每个生产队都写出了一份比较详细的调查研究材料，主要内容包括今年的粮食产量、分配情况，今年秋冬和明年生产、生活的具体安排计划。这些材料，对省领导机关掌握实际情况，指导基层工作很有帮助。
    省委直接抓生产队的领导方法，也带动了各县、各公社更加重视对生产队的领导。最近，化隆、湟源、乐都等县领导干部都分期分批地召开了生产队座谈会，切实地逐队安排工作，解决了一个一个的具体问题。
    由于从省到公社都加强了对生产队的领导，就帮助生产队干部提高了政策水平和改进了工作方法，党的许多政策也比较迅速地通过基层干部交给了群众，变为群众的行动，使全省基层工作出现了一派新气象。据省委最近召集一部分生产队支部书记汇报的情况，这些队都贯彻执行了座谈会的精神。
