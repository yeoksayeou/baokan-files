A Bloody History of Yerba Mate Workers
——Reading the Argentine Novel "Dark River"
Yang Feng

    In the mid-South American region, upstream of the Paraná River, where Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil meet, dense primeval forests abound. Within these boundless forests grow many wild yerba mate groves. The leaves of the yerba mate tree can be made into yerba mate tea (locally called mate tea or Paraguayan tea), a refreshing beverage consumed daily by the people of South American countries. Due to the large demand, yerba mate has gained significant economic value. Consequently, this plant, like "green gold," has become an object of intense plunder by colonialists.
    Argentine modern writer Alfredo Varela's novel "Dark River" depicts the true situation in the 1930s where colonialists plundered yerba mate forests, exploited the sweat and blood of laborers, and sought exorbitant profits. In a section titled "Invasion," the author portrays the scene of colonialist intrusion: "They (referring to the invaders) neither cultivate nor sow; they establish no new life. They merely wander, destroy, harm, and kill. Their mission is called atrocity." Wherever they passed, "the land was scorched, the rivers dried up, even the fish died." "Their sole purpose is plunder, their only law is greed." "They leave treading on the dead, leaving behind a desolate scene: felled trees, parched soil, a miserable, ravaged land… Wherever they go, they bring death."
    This is a true depiction of the tragic scene caused by the invaders upstream of the Paraná River. The work profoundly and vividly exposes the towering crimes of the colonialists here. Equipped with modern weapons, they used flowery words to deceive local people into signing large numbers of labor contracts. Once these laborers signed contracts with them, they became slaves for life, unable to redeem themselves. Batch after batch of laborers were driven alive into the primeval forests, but few were able to return alive. Thirty years of exploitation by the colonialists eliminated the youth in some areas; the population in some areas decreased by seven-eighths; almost all the workers laboring in the Upper Paraná region died; of the three hundred people recruited for yerba mate in Villarica in 1900, only twenty returned alive; some yerba mate producing areas became graveyards. The bodies of unnamed laborers often floated downstream on the Paraná River. A wide river became a dark and terrifying river.
    The novel unfolds the creation of artistic images based on such authentic historical material.
    The novel, with the young contract laborer Ramón as the protagonist, narrates Ramón's experiences of escaping twice, unable to endure the cruel torment of the colonialists. Since childhood, Ramón had worked for business owners on farms, enduring hunger and danger, but life had never been good. However, he was still young and had courage. His brother, Adolfo, was tired of the endless wandering life and hoped for stable work. They both hoped to establish a warm home. They signed a contract with labor recruiters with this goal in mind, only to fall into a trap. Contract laborers were sent to the primeval forests upstream of the Paraná River to cut through thorns and brambles, opening up paths leading deep into the primeval forests. Here, they engaged in arduous labor. The business owners' profits increased, but the laborers' bodies became increasingly exhausted. The heavy labor, poor diet, and beatings by overseers increased the laborers' dissatisfaction. In order to prevent the laborers from slowing down, resisting, and escaping, the business owners not only used whips and beatings to supervise the laborers' work, but also prohibited them from carrying any weapons except the machetes for cutting trees, not even weapons for defending against wild animals. The laborers worked like cattle, and the meager wages they earned were forcibly taken away by the business owners under various pretexts. Before they even officially started work, the managers added an inexplicable debt, making it impossible for them to ever pay it off. Originally, Ramón's contract book registered an advance of nine hundred pesos, but later the manager insisted it was three thousand pesos, so Ramón had to work for the business owner for the rest of his life. The business owners also opened stores and canteens to extort money. The laborers' wages thus fell into the business owners' inescapable net.
    The more work done, the longer the hours, the more debt owed—this was the business owners' vicious method of treating contract laborers. Many laborers worked like livestock, lived in sheds that did not shelter them from wind and rain, and ate small amounts of rotten food, yet they remained heavily in debt. Many laborers were worn out by life before their time, and many laborers' children were as thin as dry firewood from hunger. However, that small group of vampires lived a life of extravagance. The yerba mate forest manager, Hager, lived in a villa built for them by the laborers in this remote primeval forest, where there was an inexhaustible supply of fine champagne and imported delicacies. When he was happy, he forced some laborers to drink to the point of intoxication with a pistol to entertain himself.
    The laborers could no longer endure the dark, barbaric, and cruel life. Xinfuriano, tormented to premature aging; Galalcha, tormented to death by tuberculosis; Ayala, whose wife was raped by the overseer and who was beaten; Lorenzo and Adolfo, who wanted to escape and were killed… Some died, some fell ill, some families were destroyed, and some escapees were abandoned in the wilderness. However, cruel exploitation, a painful life, and the threat of death did not scare the laborers, but rather nurtured their will and strength to resist. Under the enlightenment of some revolutionaries, Ramón yearned for a new life of struggle. With unparalleled courage, he broke through the attacks of the Paraná River's raging waves and finally escaped from this green hell on earth.
    The novel tells us with vivid descriptions that colonialists are a pack of man-eating jackals, a group of adventurers and cunning modern slave owners. Some of them were distant relatives of the president, good friends of the governor, and descendants of the so-called "heroes of the wilderness" notorious for massacring Native Americans. Some were business owners who occupied forests, managers who enjoyed abusing laborers, labor recruiters who trafficked laborers, and overseers who made a living from brutality. These people could see nothing but plunder. An engineer in the book, with good intentions, doubted whether the rumors of the abuse and killing of contract laborers were true. When he was traveling upstream on the Paraná River, an overseer named Miles "decently" confirmed these facts, he was stunned. He originally thought that such things would not happen in Argentina, but the facts finally shattered his naive illusion.
    The novel tells people through descriptions that one cannot have any illusions about colonialists, and that they must be treated like the song sung by a laborer in the novel: "Dog skin is the hardest to wash, no amount of soap can make it clean; it can only be shaved with a sharp sword, or blasted with gunpowder."
    This novel was published by the author in 1943. The scene it presents is breathtaking. The complete text of the book, including the prologue and epilogue, consists of approximately sixty sections, with historical materials of the story depicted by the author inserted into more than half of the chapters. The historical materials collected by the author are abundant, including police reports, testimonies, records, diaries, travel notes, adventure stories, and academic works. The authors of these materials include police officers, court judges, explorers, and scientists. This leaves us with a deep and vivid impression after reading. Another feature of this novel is that in about one-third of the chapters, the author constantly uses titles such as "Invasion" and "In the Trap" to mark the extracted materials, clearly expressing the author's anti-colonial stance.

    冬青茶工人的血泪史
    ——读阿根廷小说《阴暗的河流》
    杨风
    在南美洲中部、巴拉那河的上游，阿根廷、巴拉圭、巴西三国接壤的地方，密布着原始森林。在无边无际的森林中，生长着许多野生的冬青林。冬青树的叶子可以制成冬青茶（当地叫马黛茶或巴拉圭茶），这是南美洲各国人民日常饮用的清凉饮料。由于大量的需要，冬青茶便获得了很高的经济价值。因此，这种像“绿色的金子”一样的植物，便成为殖民主义者竞相掠夺的对象。
    阿根廷现代著名作家阿尔弗雷陀·伐莱拉的小说《阴暗的河流》，描写了二十世纪三十年代殖民主义者在这里掠夺冬青林、榨取劳工血汗、谋取暴利的真实情景。作者在一节《侵略》中这样描绘了殖民者入侵的景象：“他们（指侵略者）不耕不种，他们不建立任何新生活。他们一味流浪、破坏、伤害和杀戮。他们的使命叫作暴行。”凡是他们经过的地方，“土焦河涸，连鱼都死掉”。“他们的唯一目的就是掠夺，他们的唯一法律就是贪欲。”“他们踏着死人离开，留下一片荒凉：砍倒的树木，干枯的土壤，悲惨的、被蹂躏的土地。……他们走到哪里就把死亡带到哪里。”
    这是入侵者在巴拉那河上游所造成的悲惨景象的真实写照。作品深刻、生动地揭露了殖民主义者在这里的滔天罪行。他们装备着新式武器，用花言巧语在当地骗取大量契约劳工，这些劳工一经和他们签订合同，便变成终生不能赎身的奴隶。一批一批的劳工们被活着赶进原始森林，但能活着回来的却寥寥无几。殖民主义者在这里三十年的剥削，把某些地区的青年都消灭了；有些地区的人口减少了八分之七；在上巴拉那地区劳动的工人几乎全死光了；1900年在微拉里科为冬青林征募的三百个人，活着回来的不过二十人；一些生产冬青茶的地区变成了坟墓。巴拉那河的水面上，经常从上游漂来不知姓名的劳工尸体。一条宽阔的河，变成了一条阴暗可怕的河。
    小说就是在这样真实历史资料的基础上，展开艺术形象创造的。
    小说以年青的契约劳工拉蒙为主角，叙述了拉蒙不堪忍受殖民主义者的残酷折磨两次逃亡的经历。拉蒙从小就在农场给企业主干活，挨饿、冒险，但生活从没有好过过。可是他还年轻，还有一股勇气。他哥哥阿多尔福对没有尽头的流浪生活已经厌倦了，希望有个安定的工作。他们都希望建立一个温暖的家。他们抱着这个目的和招工人签订了合同，谁知从此便堕入陷阱。契约劳工们被送到巴拉那河上游的原始森林中，披荆斩棘，开辟一条条通往原始森林深处的小道。在这里，他们进行沉重的劳动。企业主的利润增长了，劳工们的身体却愈来愈衰竭了。沉重的劳动，恶劣的饮食，监工人的打骂，使劳工们的不满情绪日益增长。企业主为了防止劳工们怠工、反抗和逃跑，不但用皮鞭、毒打监视劳工们劳动，而且除砍树的弯刀外，不准携带任何武器，那怕是防御野兽侵袭的武器。劳工们像牛马一样干活，所得的微薄工资也被企业主用各种各样的名目强夺了去。他们还未正式上工，经理人就给加上一笔不知由来的欠款，使他们终身还不清。本来拉蒙的契约簿上登记的是预支九百比索，但后来经理人硬说是三千比索，这样拉蒙就得为企业主干一辈子。企业主们还开设商店、食堂等，进行敲诈勒索。劳工们的工资就这样落到企业主的天罗地网里去了。
    干得活愈多，干得时间愈长，欠得债愈多，这是企业主对待契约劳工的毒辣手段。多少劳工像牲口一样干活，住不避风雨的棚子，吃少量的腐臭食物，但他们仍债台高筑。多少劳工被生活折磨得未老先衰，多少劳工的孩子饿得像一把枯柴。可是那一小撮吸血鬼们却过着花天酒地的生活。冬青林的经理哈格，在这偏僻的原始森林里住着劳工们给他们建造的别墅，这里有取之不尽的上等香槟酒，舶来的珍馐。他高兴的时候用手枪强迫一些劳工喝得酩酊大醉以取乐。
    劳工们在黑暗、野蛮、残酷的生活里实在熬不下去了。被折磨得未老先衰的辛福里阿诺，被折磨得痨瘵而死的加拉尔察，被监工强奸妻子并遭毒打的阿亚拉，想逃亡而被杀的洛伦佐、阿多尔福……，死的死了，病的病了，有家的家破人亡，逃亡的弃尸荒野。可是残酷的剥削，痛苦的生活，死亡的威胁，吓不倒劳工们，却孕育着劳工们反抗的意志和力量。拉蒙就在一些革命者的启发下，向往着新的斗争生活。他以无比的勇气，冲破了巴拉那河惊涛骇浪的袭击，终于逃出了这座绿色的人间地狱。
    小说以生动的描写告诉我们殖民主义者是一群吃人的豺狼，一群冒险家、狡猾的现代奴隶主。他们当中有的是总统的远亲，总督的好友，屠杀印第安人而臭名昭著的所谓“荒野英雄”的后代。有的是霸占森林的企业主，虐待劳工取乐的经理，贩运劳工的招工人和以残暴为业的监工人。这些人除了掠夺，别的他们什么也看不见。书中有一位工程师抱着善良的愿望怀疑虐杀契约劳工的传闻是否属实，当他在巴拉那河上游旅行时，一位监工人米雷斯很“体面”地证实了这些事实后，他惊呆了。他原以为阿根廷不会有这种事，但事实终于使他天真的幻想破灭了。
    小说通过描写告诉人们，对待殖民主义者不能存任何幻想，对待他们要像小说里一位劳工唱的歌那样：“狗皮最难洗，肥皂再搓也不净；对它只能利剑削，再不就用火药崩。”
    这部小说是作者1943年发表的。它展示的场面是惊心动魄的。全书正文加上序幕和尾声共约六十来节，在半数以上的章节中插进作者所描绘的故事的历史资料。作者搜集到的历史资料是丰富的，包括警察报告、证词、记录、日记、游记、历险记和学术著作。这些资料的作者包括警察、法院推事、探险家和科学家。这就使我们读后留下深刻、鲜明的印象。这部小说的另一个特点是作者在约三分之一的章节中不断以《侵略》《在陷阱中》为题标放在所摘录的资料上，鲜明地表现了作者的反对殖民主义的立场。
