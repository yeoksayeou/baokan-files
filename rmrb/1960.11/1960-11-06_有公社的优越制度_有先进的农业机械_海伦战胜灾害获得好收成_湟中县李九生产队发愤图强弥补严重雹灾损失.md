Harbin Dispatch, November 5th: Hailun County in Heilongjiang Province overcame severe flooding, enabling this year's crops to still achieve a good harvest.

Hailun County has vast land, flat terrain, and fertile soil, suitable for planting various crops. Last year, the total grain output reached more than 1,120 million jin, which means that each agricultural laborer produced 15,214 jin of grain in a year. The amount of marketable grain sold to the state last year reached more than 676 million jin, which is more than the total grain output in 1957, with a commodity rate of 60.4%. This year, from spring plowing to autumn harvest, it has been continuously rainy, with rainfall from January to September reaching 632 millimeters, exceeding any year in history, and the temperature was low, with little sunshine. Some areas were also affected by wind and hail. However, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the county, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, overcame the severe natural disasters and won a good harvest comparable to last year.

In this year's production, Hailun County conscientiously implemented the policy of combining multiple planting for more yield with high yield for more yield, laying a reliable foundation for this year's production. During spring plowing and sowing, on the one hand, they carried out large-scale land reclamation, expanding the cultivated land by more than 375,000 mu. When spring plowing was basically over, a small spring plowing campaign was launched, and all idle fields and gaps in front of and behind houses, beside villages and roads, and on the edges of fields were planted with sunflowers, hemp seeds, feed, etc. On the other hand, narrow ridges and increased rows were universally promoted. Wheat and some soybeans were planted flat, and intercropping, mixed cropping, and strip cropping were also implemented. Corn was generally mixed with soybeans in soybean fields, and soybeans or kidney beans were generally mixed with corn in cornfields. Due to rational close planting, increasing the number of plants, and expanding the green area, more than 135,000 mu was added.

Hailun County has a frost-free period of only 120 days, and each agricultural laborer is responsible for 57.3 mu of cultivated land. Now, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the county has reached about 70%. This year alone, between spring plowing and summer hoeing, more than 580,000 labor days and more than 760,000 horse labor days were saved, greatly accelerating the progress of cultivation.

The People's Commune has demonstrated its great superiority in the struggle against natural disasters. In the past, 900,000 mu of land here often suffered from waterlogging, seriously affecting grain production. After the people's communes were established in 1958, 134 large and medium-sized reservoirs and other water conservancy projects were built. These water conservancy projects, after being reinforced and repaired this year, withstood the test of floods and played a huge role in the struggle against extraordinary rain, greatly reducing the area of cultivated land affected by waterlogging this year.

Xining Dispatch, November 5th: After suffering severe hail damage, the Lijiu Production Team of the Lushaer Commune in Huangzhong County, Qinghai, launched a production and disaster relief campaign with the revolutionary spirit of soaring aspirations. At present, the team has swept up more than 7,000 jin of grain knocked down by hail, harvested more than 200,000 jin of non-staple foods and vegetables, collected more than 50,000 jin of wild starch plant seeds, collected more than 30,000 jin of fodder, and caught more than 20,000 jin of fish. Income from sideline occupations has exceeded 30,000 yuan, minimizing disaster losses and basically achieving self-sufficiency in rations and feed.

This year, when crops were ripening, the Lijiu Production Team was hit by three hailstorms unseen in a century, causing more than 90% of the crops to suffer damage. The Party branch promptly put forward the slogan "Recover the losses from summer and autumn fields in the 'small autumn harvest'; make up for the loss of grain with vegetables; make up for the loss of agriculture with sideline occupations," and submitted the production and disaster relief plan and specific measures to the masses for discussion. A production and disaster relief campaign quickly unfolded: sweeping up the green barley ears and broad bean pods knocked down by the hail; loosening the soil, weeding, topdressing, and watering the affected potato and vegetable fields in an effort to harvest more; replanting cabbage in the severely affected land that could not be salvaged, and replanting seedlings in the missing seedling land; organizing commune members to go on a distant expedition for a "small autumn harvest": digging fern tubers, cutting fodder grass, catching Huang fish, hunting wild animals, digging medicinal materials, opening up various avenues, tapping resources in every possible way, and recovering losses in every possible way. In the spirit of "taking the next step based on the current step," labor, livestock, and vehicles were properly arranged to seize the time for autumn plowing and accumulating and delivering fertilizer to prepare for next year's production.

The vast number of commune members showed a heroic spirit of not fearing difficulties and revolutionary optimism in production for self-salvation. A group of young men from the fertilizer delivery team were inspired by the hail disaster to work even harder. They said:
"What we lose this year, we will take back next year. We will quickly deliver good fertilizer to the ground early so that we can have a great harvest next year." Guo Rongling, a 59-year-old commune member, witnessed the tragic scene of people selling their children and fleeing famine after the disaster in 1929. He said: "This year's disaster is the most serious, but the Party is leading us to carry out production and disaster relief, and we are getting more and more things back, so we are not worried anymore. We just have to work hard to grow the crops well!" Under the leadership of the Party, the cadres and commune members of the whole team, with one heart and one mind, are now turning over the entire cultivated land for the first time in order to win a bumper harvest next year, and are determined to turn over all the paddy fields two to three times before freezing. At present, 69 mu of winter wheat has been sown, and it is planned to sow 1,200 mu of spring wheat near winter to shorten the period of food shortage. (Attached picture)

The power of the People's Commune is really great!" (Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Wu Hua)

    海伦战胜灾害获得好收成
    湟中县李九生产队发愤图强弥补严重雹灾损失
    本报哈尔滨5日电　黑龙江省海伦县战胜了严重的水灾，使今年的庄稼仍然获得很好的收成。
    海伦县土地广阔，地势平坦，土质肥沃，适于种植各种庄稼。去年粮食总产量达到十一亿二千多万斤，也就是说每个农业劳动力一年生产一万五千二百十四斤粮食。去年出售给国家的商品粮达六亿七千六百多万斤，比1957年粮食总产量还多，商品率达到60.4％。今年这里从春耕到秋收，一直是阴雨连绵，1至9月的降雨量达六百三十二毫米，超过历史上任何一年，而且气温低，日照少，有的地方还受到风灾雹灾。但是全县人民，在党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，战胜了严重自然灾害，赢得了和去年不相上下的好年成。
    海伦县在今年的生产中，认真贯彻了多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，为今年生产打下可靠的基础。春耕播种时，他们一方面进行大面积开荒，扩大了三十七万五千多亩耕地。在春耕基本结束的时候，开展了小春耕运动，把房前房后，屯旁路旁，地头地边的闲田隙地全部种上了向日葵、麻籽、饲料等。一方面普遍推行了缩垅增行。小麦和一部分大豆进行了平播，还实行了间种、混种、套种，大豆地里普遍混种了苞米，苞米地里普遍混种了大豆或芸豆。由于合理密植，增加株数，扩大了绿色面积十三万五千多亩。
    海伦县无霜期只有一百二十几天，每个农业劳动力负担五十七点三亩耕地。现在全县机械化、半机械化程度已达到70％左右。仅今年春耕和夏锄中间，就节省了五十八万多个劳动日，七十六万多个马工，大大加快了耕作进度。
    人民公社在和自然灾害作斗争中，显示了巨大优越性。在过去这里经常有九十来万亩地遭受内涝，严重影响粮食增产。1958年人民公社化后，兴修了一百三十四座大、中型水库等水利工程，这些水利工程，经过今年加固维修，经受了洪水的考验，在和特大雨水作斗争中，发挥了巨大作用，使今年耕地受涝面积大大缩小。
    本报西宁5日电　青海湟中县鲁沙尔公社李九生产队遭受严重雹灾后，以壮志凌云的革命气概，开展了生产救灾运动。目前，全队已扫拾回来被雹雨打掉的粮食七千多斤，收获副食品及蔬菜二十多万斤，采集野生淀粉植物子实五万多斤，采回饲料饲草三万多斤，捕鱼二万多斤，副业方面已收入三万多元。使灾害损失缩减到最小限度，基本上达到了口粮和饲料自给。
    今年庄稼成熟时节，李九生产队连降三次百年不遇的冰雹，使90％以上的庄稼遭受灾害。党支部及时提出了“夏秋田损失的，‘小秋收’夺回来；粮食丢了，蔬菜补；农业丢了，副业补”的口号，并将生产救灾计划和具体措施交群众讨论。于是一个生产救灾的运动迅速开展起来：扫拾被冰雹打落的青稞穗和蚕豆角；对受灾的洋芋及蔬菜田，普遍进行了松土、除草、追肥、浇水，力争多收；在受灾严重无法挽救的地里，及时抢种了白菜，缺苗地里也进行了补种；组织社员远征大搞“小秋收”：挖蕨麻，割饲草，捕湟鱼，打野兽，挖药材，广开门路，大挖资源，千方百计，挽回损失。并本着“走上步看下步”的精神，妥善安排劳畜力和车辆，抓紧秋翻、积送肥等明年生产的准备工作。
    广大社员在生产自救中表现了不怕困难的英雄气概和革命乐观精神。送肥专业队一群小伙子，被雹灾激起了更大的干劲，他们说：
  “今年损失的，明年拿回来。我们快把好肥料早送下地，叫明年来个大丰收。”五十九岁的社员郭荣令，亲眼看到1929年受灾后人们卖儿卖女逃荒的悲惨情景，他说：“今年受灾最重，可是党领导我们开展生产救灾，搞回来的东西越来越多，我们也不耽心了，只有鼓劲把庄稼种好！”全队的干部、社员在党的领导下，一条心，一股劲，为夺取明年丰收，现已将全部耕地翻完了头遍，并决心在结冻前将所有水地翻二至三遍。目前已播种冬麦六十九亩，计划临冬播种春麦一千二百亩，以缩短青黄不接时期。（附图片）
