Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 18th: The Korean People's Army Ensemble arrived in Hangzhou this morning from Fuzhou by special train. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed at the station by officers and soldiers of the Hangzhou garrison and people from all walks of life in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City.

Ren Yili, Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province, Major General Guo Zhuoxin, head of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang, and Zhou Fengming, Vice Mayor of Hangzhou, welcomed the distinguished guests at the station. Representatives of combat heroes and meritorious servicemen of the former Chinese People's Volunteers also went to the station to welcome their Korean comrades. Today, the welcoming crowds at Hangzhou Station held flowers and colorful flags, waiting for the arrival of the distinguished guests. When the ensemble's leader, Major General Zhang Ruihuan, and others got off the train and passed through the station hall, a group of singing and dancing girls scattered colorful confetti over the distinguished guests. In the station square, representatives of literary and art groups performed the Zhejiang folk dance "Tea-Picking Dance" for the distinguished guests. At this time, gongs and drums resounded through the square, firecrackers crackled, applause thundered, and people enthusiastically cheered, welcoming the envoys of the heroic Korean people.

In the afternoon, the distinguished Korean guests, accompanied by Major General Wei Chuantong, representative of our Ministry of National Defense, and Major General Guo Zhuoxin, head of the Zhejiang garrison, boated on West Lake, admired the scenery of the lake and mountains, and visited the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and the Flower Harbor Viewing Fish Park.

In the evening, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee and the Zhejiang Military Region hosted a banquet to welcome the Korean People's Army Ensemble. Ren Yili, Vice Governor of Zhejiang Province, said at the banquet that there is a deep, militant friendship between the people of China and Korea, and this friendship is forged in blood. It will be evergreen like the pines and cypresses of Changbai Mountain and flow endlessly like the Yalu River. Major General Guo Zhuoxin said that we fully support our government's statement in support of the memorandum of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the issue of the peaceful reunification of Korea, and we resolutely support the Korean people's just struggle to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves. The American aggressors must immediately withdraw completely from South Korea, and the United States must stop using the name of the United Nations or any other means to interfere in Korea.

Zhang Ruihuan said at the banquet that today American imperialism still occupies the southern half of our motherland and China's territory of Taiwan, and is preparing new wars of aggression all over the world. But any aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism will be completely shattered. The Korean people will surely be able to force the American imperialist aggressors to get out of South Korea and peacefully reunify the motherland, and China's territory of Taiwan will surely be able to return to the embrace of the Chinese people.

After the banquet, the distinguished guests watched a local opera performed by the Zhejiang Shaoxing Opera Troupe.

    新华社杭州18日电　朝鲜人民军协奏团今天上午从福州乘专车到达杭州。贵宾们在车站上受到了杭州驻军官兵和浙江省、杭州市各界人民的热烈欢迎。
    浙江省副省长任一力，中国人民解放军驻浙江部队首长郭卓辛少将，杭州市副市长周凤鸣到车站欢迎了贵宾。前中国人民志愿军战斗英雄和功臣代表也到车站欢迎朝鲜战友。今天，杭州车站上欢迎的群众手执鲜花、彩旗，迎候着贵宾们的到来。当协奏团团长张瑞焕少将等下车后通过车站大厅时，一群载歌载舞的姑娘，向贵宾们撒去五彩缤纷的彩纸。在车站广场上，文艺团体的代表为贵宾们表演了浙江民间舞蹈“采茶舞”。这时，广场上锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，掌声雷动，人们热烈欢呼，欢迎英雄的朝鲜人民的使者。
