Joyful Reunion (Lyrics)
From Lan Jiantang of Xin Dian People's Commune, Nanyang, Henan

It is dawn, and the morning stars are few. Commune members rise early to deliver manure to the fields. They compete and rush, full of energy, with songs and laughter shaking the earth. At this moment, a man walks out from the village, appearing to be about forty-seven years old. He has a ruddy complexion, a high nose, and a tall, sturdy build. He wears a faded but clean cloth jacket, and carries a worn straw hat in his hand. He greets the commune members at the edge of the field:

(Aside) You all came early, I was a bit slow to start work!

After speaking, he quickly picks up a manure basket, and strides forward with long steps. This man’s words are not important, but they cause the girls spreading manure to giggle. Yulan says: Old accountant, so old-fashioned! Jinfeng says: Why don’t you consider your words! Who is that comrade called? Is he an accountant based on what?

(Aside) I heard the voice sounds very similar, but you mistakenly placed Henan in Great Shaanxi.

(Aside) Then who do you say he is? Even I don't recognize him. Anyway, you're listening to everything, mistakenly thinking eighteen is seventeen. Let's not talk about everyone's wild guesses, and bring up that comrade again. He carries load after load, the manure baskets full. Look how fast he runs, carrying the pole as if he's on an airplane! Hey! I think I've seen this person before, but I can't remember for a moment. Recently, a large number of cadres have come down to engage in agriculture, he must be from there. The girls are guessing back and forth, and suddenly a large group of people delivering manure rush over. Dozens of carrying poles surge forward, each faster than the last. A person is running in front of the team, it is the captain, Zhang Huaqi. Captain Zhang is running forward, oh, suddenly he jumps a mile high. He opens his throat and shouts loudly, happy as if he's eaten honey.

(Aside) Ah, Secretary Li, I saw you from afar and thought it was you. When did you come to our village?

Everyone hears it's Secretary Li, and they are stunned and amazed. They all say that the secretary came to deliver manure for us, otherwise, we wouldn't recognize him. The commune members are talking back and forth, but Secretary Li replies humorously:

"It's rare that we meet, hence why you don't recognize me. I should be reversing my own bureaucracy."

Captain Zhang laughs heartily beside him, and calls out something softly for you to listen carefully: Secretary Li lived in our village for three or four years, back when you were still young. Secretary Li led the land reform and struggled against the landlords, and we poor people were given houses and land. Today, he's come back to our village, how can everyone not be happy!

Everyone is talking, when Old Man Wang Laoqi squeezes through the crowd, steps forward, grabs the secretary's hand, and is so excited that tears fill his eyes: Since you left our home that year, your aunt and I often mention you. We often look for you outside the door, and see you in our dreams at night. I dream of you carrying water in the heavy snow, dreaming of you returning to the village to work in the mud. It's been ten whole years since I saw you, and you look like you're in good spirits! When your aunt sees you today, she'll definitely slaughter a big hen for you.

(Aside) Hey, Lao Li, are you leaving this time or not? Are you staying for three days and leaving early? Let's say it's okay if you stay often, but if you leave, I won't allow it!

The Secretary says (Aside) I'm not leaving, Uncle! This time I'm settling down in our village, for three or five years, or even longer. We must work together to develop agriculture, and raise the grain yield. From now on, we must all discuss more and come up with more ideas for increasing production. However, I know little about agricultural technology, and I still need to learn from everyone. Please rest assured, Uncle Wang, and tell Aunt not to slaughter the big hen.

Before Secretary Li's words have even finished, the commune members are overjoyed. Secretary Li spoke with determination, and it adds a thousand pounds of strength to our bodies. Now we must seize the time to transport more fertilizer, and first win the first place for next year's wheat. After speaking, the battle of delivering manure begins again, and everyone's enthusiasm is high. Secretary Li takes the lead and runs ahead, and the commune members behind him follow closely, determined to catch up with the secretary, with thousands of commune members learning together.

    喜相逢（唱词）
    河南南阳新店公社　兰建堂说的是东方发白晨星稀，社员们起早送粪到地里。你追我赶劲头大，歌声笑声震天地。这时候村内走出一个人，年纪约有四十七。红红的脸膛高高的鼻，大个子显得挺有力。穿一件褪色的布褂倒干净，有一顶半旧草帽手中提。到地头先和社员打招呼：
  （夹白）你们都来得早，上工晚我可有点不积极！说罢话他把粪筐忙担起，迈开大步走得疾。这人说话不打紧，只惹得撒粪的姑娘笑嘻嘻。玉兰说：老会计，老暮气，金凤说：你说话怎么不考虑！那位同志他叫啥：是会计你有啥根据？
  （夹白）我听声音非常像，偏偏你河南错到大陕西。
  （夹白）那你说他是谁呀？他是谁连我也是认不得。反正你东西耳朵南北听，错把十八当十七。咱且不说众人乱猜想，再把那位同志提。他担了一趟又一趟，粪筐装得满满的。你瞧他跑得有多快，担挑子像是坐飞机。哎！我看这人好像见过面，一时咋也想不起。这几天大批干部下来搞农业，准是那里下来的。姑娘们你言我语正猜疑，一霎时拥过来送粪的人儿一大
  批。十百副挑子往前闯，一个更比一个疾。队前边跑着人一个，他就是队长张华岐。张队长正在往前跑，哟，忽然一蹦二丈一。拉开嗓子高声叫，喜欢得好像吃了蜜。
  （白）唉、李书记，我老远看着就像你。啥时来到咱村里？众人一听李书记，目瞪口呆齐惊奇。都说是书记给咱来送粪，要不说咱还认不得。众社员你言我语且不表，李书记回答有风趣：
  “不认识是咱见面稀，应该反一反我这官僚主义。”张队长一旁哈哈笑，叫声小有你听仔细：李书记在咱村住过三四年，那时你还小着的。李书记领导土改斗地主，咱穷人才分了房子和土地。今天他又来咱村，大家怎么不欢喜！大家伙正在讲话，人群中挤过来老汉王老七，走上前一把抓着书记的手，激动得两眼热泪滴：自从你那年离咱家，你大娘俺俩常把你来提。时常想你门外望，夜晚做梦常见你。梦见你冒着大雪去担水，梦见你回村工作踏着泥。整整十年没见你，看起来你的精神好着哩！今日你大娘见了你，准给你杀个大母鸡。
  （白）嗨：老李呀，这回你还走不走？是不是住那三天两早起？咱先说要是常住还则罢，要是走了我不依！书记说（白）不走了，大伯！我这次要在咱村安家落户，三年五年可不定期。咱们要同心协力办农业，要叫那粮食产量往上提。从今后咱们大家要多商量，多为增产出主意。不过农业技术我懂的少，还需要向大家多学习。请你王大伯多放心，叫大娘也莫要去杀大母鸡。李书记的话音未落地，众社员高兴得了不得，李书记说出了决心话，给咱们浑身又添了千斤力。现在要抓紧时间多运肥，先夺个明年小麦占第一。说罢话送粪的战斗又开始，人人的干劲都不低。李书记一马当先头前跑，身后边社员个个跟得急，决心要把书记赶，千百个社员齐学习。
