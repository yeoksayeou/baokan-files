    Developing More Repair Service Points
    The Dongsi People's Market in Beijing was known in the past for its wide variety and comprehensive range of goods, both large and small. Now, this comprehensive shopping center is also gaining praise from the masses for its extensive repair services. They offer as many as 335 types of repair services, and seven of the market's nine sales departments now offer repair services for the products they sell. Clothes can be altered from large to small, from men's to women's, and old clothes can be renewed; knitted underwear can be mended if torn, and cuffs and collars can be replaced. People affectionately call the Dongsi People's Market a "Commodity Hospital."
    Such "Commodity Hospitals" also exist in other cities across the country, and their services are as developed as those of the Dongsi People's Market. This shows that repair services are generally welcomed by the masses. Every household, men and women alike, which household or person doesn't have many daily necessities that need repair? Clothes need to be mended when torn, cotton needs to be fluffed when old, pots, kettles, jars, tables, chairs, benches, watches, fountain pens, and even bicycles and radios need to be repaired if slightly damaged. The breadth of contact and the variety of items involved in repair services are self-evident. Some people once thought that with the improvement of people's purchasing power, repair services would not be as important as before. But this is not the case. As people's purchasing power increases, the number of items needing repair does not decrease, but increases; the importance of repair services does not diminish, but increases. Just imagine: before liberation, most people had only one piece of clothing and one pair of pants. How many things needed repairing then? Now that people have more clothes, the number of items needing repair naturally increases. Not to mention more expensive goods such as bicycles and radios, which few people had in the past but many people have now, so the need for repair naturally increases. Especially since the communization of the people, the vast number of rural women and urban housewives have joined social labor, and many things that could be repaired by themselves in the past now require more reliance on social forces to solve. Thus, developing repair services in all trades and industries has become an urgent requirement of the broad masses.
    In 1934, Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work": "All practical problems in the lives of the masses are problems we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and meet the needs of the masses, we will truly become organizers of the lives of the masses, and the masses will truly rally around us and warmly support us." Since developing repair services is a "practical problem in the lives of the masses," we should pay attention to these problems, solve these problems, and meet the needs of the masses for developing repair services. Recently, many places have already taken the widespread development of repair services as an important part of organizing people's economic life. However, the current development of repair services still cannot meet the needs. Some places are doing better, while others are doing worse. The current problem is that there are still not enough repair service points. In some places, people have to travel long distances and spend a lot of time to repair a pair of leather shoes or alter a piece of clothing. Further developing repair services and improving the quality of service is a great thing that can both meet the needs of the masses and save material wealth for the country.
    To develop repair services, the central issue is to do everything possible to provide convenience to the masses. The masses' requirements for the repair industry can be summarized in four points: First, they can find a place to repair nearby; second, the repairs can be done quickly; third, the quality of the repairs is good; and fourth, the price is cheap. When these four points are achieved, the masses will feel convenient and satisfied. Of course, for the repair service industry, it is not easy to achieve these four points. The repair business is complicated and time-consuming, and there will indeed be many difficulties that outsiders cannot imagine. However, employees engaged in the repair business should have the courage to take on all the difficulties themselves and bring convenience to the masses. This is the mass viewpoint that repair department employees should have. Now some cities have concentrated the repair service points that were originally scattered in the streets to open larger comprehensive repair department stores, which naturally has many advantages, such as being easy to manage and easy to innovate technology; but if only one form of concentrated large repair service points is developed, and the method of decentralized small repair service points is relaxed, it will instead increase many inconveniences for the masses. In short, in developing repair services, we must always consider the convenience of the masses. Those suitable for centralized management should be managed centrally; those suitable for decentralized activities should be decentralized; those suitable for setting up shops and stalls should set up shops and stalls; and those that are more convenient for the masses to go from street to street and provide mobile repairs should go from street to street and provide mobile repairs. Business hours should also be convenient for customers, the delivery time should be shortened as much as possible, the quality of repairs should be guaranteed, and the price should be more fair and reasonable.
    To further develop repair services, achieve convenience for the masses, and make the best use of everything, it is necessary to solve the problems of people and materials. With so many repair service names and such a large volume of business, it is impossible without corresponding repair power. To solve this problem, on the one hand, we must improve business management, improve the political and ideological awareness of existing employees, educate them to love their work, give full play to their potential, and continuously improve work efficiency. On the other hand, we must appropriately supplement strength according to needs and possibilities. The factories of urban people's communes should regard repair business as one of their main businesses. The salespeople of commercial departments should learn repair technology and achieve both operation and repair, selling what to repair. Repair workers who can return to the team should be mobilized to return to the team, and repair workers who have left production should also be mobilized to rejoin production. Repair workers in all trades and industries should innovate technology by themselves and continuously improve repair efficiency. With people, there must also be materials. Although repairing and mending does not require as many materials as manufacturing new products, it still requires a part of the materials after all, and the varieties and specifications are also very complicated. To solve this problem, we must also start from two aspects: on the one hand, relevant departments in various places should pay attention to appropriately arranging the materials needed by the repair service industry when arranging production; on the other hand, the repair industry should also actively think of more ways to link up with factories, waste product recycling departments, etc., and make full use of their side materials, scraps, waste materials, and so on.
    Repair is a career that is always young. Ten thousand years later, there will still be a repair industry. It is inconceivable that social products are extremely rich, clothes do not need to be dismantled, washed, sewn and altered, and watches can be repaired when broken. Many people in the repair industry recognize the significance of their labor and love their labor. Regardless of the cold in winter and the heat in summer, they push their carts, carry their burdens, walk through the streets, and pass through the alleys, using their skills to restore the life of various old materials, so that the results of people's hard work can be given the fullest effect. Their labor is respected by the broad masses. We hope that the employees of the repair industry and the employees of all trades and industries who can also engage in the repair industry will work together to develop more repair service points and bring more convenience to the lives of the masses!

### 发展更多的修理服务点

    发展更多的修理服务点
    北京的东四人民市场，过去是以品种繁多、大小商品一应俱全出名的，现在这个综合商场又以广设修理业务得到群众的好评。他们经营的修理项目多达三百三十五种，全市场九个售货部已有七个做到卖什么修什么。衣服可以大改小、男改女、旧翻新；针织内衣破了可以补，袖口、领口破了可以换，人们亲切地称呼东四人民市场是“商品医院”。
    这样的“商品医院”，全国其他城市也有，并且业务都像东四人民市场一样的发达。这说明修理业务是普遍受到群众欢迎的业务。家家户户、男男女女，哪一户、哪一个人没有许多日常生活用品需要修理？衣服破了要补，棉花旧了要弹，锅壶坛罐、桌椅板凳、手表金笔，以至自行车、收音机等等，稍有损坏都要修理。修理业务联系群众之广，接触的项目之多，是不言而喻的。有些人曾经认为，随着人民购买能力的提高，修理业务不像以前那么重要了。其实不然。人民的购买力提高了，需要修理的东西恰恰不是少了，而是多了；修理业务恰恰不是不重要了，而是更重要了。试想：解放以前，多数的人衣不过一件，裤不过一条，能有多少需要修理的东西呢？现在衣服多了，需要修补的自然也多了。更不用说自行车、收音机等比较贵重的商品，过去有的人很少，现在有的人很多，需要修理的自然也多起来。特别是人民公社化以后，广大的农村妇女和城市家庭妇女参加了社会劳动，许多过去可以自己修修补补的东西，现在需要更多地依靠社会力量来解决。这样，发展各行各业的修理业务，就更加成为广大群众的迫切要求。
    1934年，毛泽东同志在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文中就曾说过：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众生活的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”发展修理业务，既然是“群众的实际生活问题”，我们就应当注意这些问题，解决这些问题，满足群众对于发展修理业务的需要。最近一段时间，许多地方已经把广泛开展修理服务工作作为组织人民经济生活的重要内容之一。但是，目前修理业务的发展情况仍然还不能适应需要。有的地方搞得好一些，有的地方就搞得差一些。当前的问题是修理服务点还嫌不足，有些地方人们为了修一双皮鞋、改一件衣服要跑很远的路，花费很多时间。进一步发展修理业务，提高服务质量，是一件既能满足群众的需要，又能为国家节约物质财富的大好事情。
    发展修理业务，中心问题是要千方百计地给群众以方便。群众对修理行业的要求，可以概括为四点：一是能就近找到地方修；二是能很快修好；三是修理的质量好；四是价钱便宜。这四点做到了，群众就感到方便、满意。当然，对于修理服务行业说来，要做到这四点并不容易。修理业务项目繁杂，费工费事，确实会有很多局外人难以设想的困难。但是，从事修理业务的职工应该有这样的气魄：把一切困难由自己包下来，把方便带给群众。这是修理部门职工应该具有的群众观点。现在有些城市把原来分散在街道的从事修理业务的点，集中起来，开设规模较大的综合修理门市部，这自然有很多好处，例如便于管理，便于革新技术等等；但是如果只发展集中的大修理服务点一种形式，放松了分散的小修理服务点的办法，就会反而给群众增加许多不便。总之，发展修理业务，一定要处处考虑群众的方便，适于集中经营的就集中经营；适于分散活动的就分散活动；适于设店、设摊的，就设店、设摊；走街串巷，流动修理更能便利群众的，就串街走巷，流动修理。营业时间也要便利顾客，交货的时间要尽可能地缩短，修理的质量要有保证，价钱也要更加公平合理。
    进一步发展修理业务，做到方便群众，物尽其用，要解决人的问题和料的问题。修理业务名目这样多，业务量这样大，没有相应的修理力量是不行的。解决这个问题，一方面要改善经营管理，提高现有从业人员的政治思想觉悟，教育他们热爱自己的工作，发挥潜力，不断地提高工作效率。另一方面要根据需要和可能，适当地充实力量。城市人民公社的工厂应当把修理业务当作自己的主要业务之一。商业部门的营业员应当学习修理技术，做到兼营兼修，卖什么修什么。能够归队的修理业的人员，应当动员他们归队，脱离了生产的修理业的职工，也应当动员他们重新参加生产。各行各业的修理工人，应当自己动手革新技术，不断提高修理效率。有了人，还要有料。修修补补虽然不像制造新产品那样需要很多的材料，但是毕竟还是需要一部分材料的，而且品种规格还很繁杂。解决这个问题，也要从两方面着手：一方面各地有关部门在安排生产时要注意适当安排修理服务业需要的材料；另一方面修理行业也要主动多想办法，如同工厂、废品收购部门等挂钩，充分利用他们的边材、下脚、废料等等。
    修理，是一项青春常在的事业。一万年之后，也要有修理这一行。不能设想，社会产品极大地丰富了，衣服就不需要拆洗缝改，手表坏了就可以不修。修理这一行里有许多人是认识到自己劳动的意义、热爱自己的劳动的。他们不管冬寒夏暑，推着车子，挑着担子，走过大街，穿过小巷，用自己的手艺恢复种种残旧物资的生命，使人们辛勤劳动的成果能够最充分地发挥效能。他们的劳动得到广大群众的尊敬。我们希望修理行业的职工和一切能够兼营修理行业的各行各业的职工共同努力，发展更多的修理服务点，给群众生活带来更多的方便！
