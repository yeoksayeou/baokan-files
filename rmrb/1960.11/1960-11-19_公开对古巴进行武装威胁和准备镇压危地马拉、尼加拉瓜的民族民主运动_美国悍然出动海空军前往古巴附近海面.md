Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower ordered the U.S. Navy on the 17th to dispatch maritime and air forces to the Caribbean Sea and its airspace near Cuba. This is another step by the United States in openly making armed provocations against Cuba and supporting the shaky American puppet regimes in Guatemala and Nicaragua.

The order, announced by White House Press Secretary Hagerty, was issued by Eisenhower yesterday after consultations with Secretary of State Herter. In order to conceal the blatant armed interference by the United States in the Caribbean situation and the intensified actions to launch armed attacks on Cuba, Hagerty said that the purpose of the American troops sent to the Caribbean was to so-called "identify and prevent communist-led elements from abroad...interfering in the internal affairs of Guatemala and Nicaragua." When reporters asked whether the so-called "abroad" mentioned by the U.S. government referred to Cuba, Hagerty blatantly said it "referred to Cuba."

Hagerty also said that the U.S. government's decision was made at the "request of Guatemala and Nicaragua," which was received on Wednesday. But he then contradicted himself, saying that the troops sent to the Caribbean had been on "standby" "for several days."

Shortly after Hagerty made his statement, a Navy spokesman in Washington said that five destroyers and an aircraft carrier had been dispatched to patrol the Caribbean Sea. Navy sources said that four destroyers were patrolling "waters not far from Cuba," and another was refueling in Panama and would then sail along the eastern coast of Central America near Nicaragua and Guatemala. The offensive aircraft carrier "Shangri-La" is supporting these destroyers in the region. The spokesman also said that in addition to ships at sea, naval aircraft will also patrol at sea.

While sending troops to the vicinity of Cuba, the U.S. government is stepping up preparations to further interfere in Cuba under the banner of the "Organization of American States." Hagerty said with ulterior motives that he had learned that Guatemala and Nicaragua would "accuse" Cuba of "participating" in the anti-government incidents that had occurred in the two countries in the past week to the Organization of American States. The U.S. State Department also said that the United States is "prepared to provide other member governments of the Organization of American States with information on possible actions (the United States) may take." The State Department also said: "Any assistance given in accordance with the President's statement will be given at the request of the governments concerned." These words indicate that the U.S. government is preparing to invoke the infamous precedent of armed intervention in the Middle East and carry out armed intervention in Cuba under the guise of a "request" from the so-called "relevant government."

Some American newspapers have also vigorously advocated the idea of further American intervention in the Caribbean situation in the past two days. These American newspapers are even impatient to spread rumors that Guatemala and Nicaragua will "declare war" on Cuba.

Guatemala and Nicaragua are both bases from which the United States is actively preparing to launch an armed attack on Cuba. The Director of the Information Bureau of the Guatemalan Presidential Palace, Mulet, once admitted that many private estates in Guatemala are currently training "mobile military units" to be used to attack Cuba. In addition, the United States is also gathering a large number of armed interventionists in Nicaragua, who are ready to attack Cuba as soon as they receive orders.

### 公开对古巴进行武装威胁和准备镇压危地马拉、尼加拉瓜的民族民主运动  美国悍然出动海空军前往古巴附近海面

    公开对古巴进行武装威胁和准备镇压危地马拉、尼加拉瓜的民族民主运动
    美国悍然出动海空军前往古巴附近海面
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔17日命令美国海军出动海上和空中部队，前往古巴附近的加勒比海海面及其上空。这是美国公开对古巴进行武装挑衅以及支持摇摇欲坠的危地马拉和尼加拉瓜的美国傀儡政权的又一步骤。
    由白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂宣布的这个命令，是艾森豪威尔在昨天同国务卿赫脱商谈后颁布的。为了掩盖美国对加勒比地区的局势明目张胆地进行武装干涉和加紧采取武装进攻古巴的行动，哈格蒂说什么派往加勒比海的美国部队的目的是所谓“查明并防止受共产党领导的分子从国外……对危地马拉和尼加拉瓜的内政进行干涉”。新闻记者问，美国政府所提到的所谓“国外”是否指古巴，这时，哈格蒂竟然露骨地说，是“指古巴”。
    哈格蒂还说什么美国政府的决定是“美国政府应危地马拉和尼加拉瓜的要求”而作出的，这个请求是在星期三收到的。但是他接着又自相矛盾地说，派往加勒比海的部队“在几天以前”就已经处于“戒备状态”。
    在哈格蒂发表声明以后不久，海军发言人在华盛顿说，已派出五艘驱逐舰和一艘航空母舰到加勒比海巡逻。海军人士说，四艘驱逐舰正在“离古巴不远的海面”巡逻，另外一艘正在巴拿马加燃料，随后将开往沿着尼加拉瓜和危地马拉的中美东部海岸附近海面巡逻，进攻性航空母舰“香格里拉号”在这个地区支援这几艘驱逐舰。这个发言人还说，除了海面的舰只以外，海军的飞机也将在海上巡逻。
    在派部队前往古巴附近的同时，美国政府正加紧准备打着“美洲国家组织”的招牌来进一步干涉古巴。哈格蒂居心叵测地说，他已获悉危地马拉和尼加拉瓜将向美洲国家组织“控诉”古巴“参与”在过去一星期在这两个国家发生的反政府事件。美国国务院也说，美国“准备向美洲国家组织其他成员国政府提供有关（美国）可能采取的行动的情报”。国务院还说：“按照总统声明给予的任何援助，将应有关政府的请求而给予。”这些话表明，美国政府正在准备援用武装干涉中东的臭名远扬的先例，在所谓“有关政府”提出“请求”的幌子下对古巴进行武装干涉。
    一些美国报刊最近两天也大肆鼓吹美国进一步干涉加勒比海局势的主张。这些美国报刊甚至迫不及待地散布这样的说法：危地马拉和尼加拉瓜将向古巴“宣战”的传闻。
    危地马拉和尼加拉瓜都是美国积极准备对古巴发动武装进攻的基地。危地马拉总统府新闻局局长穆莱特曾经承认，在危地马拉的许多私人庄园目前正在训练准备用来进攻古巴的“机动军事部队”。此外，美国还在尼加拉瓜纠集大批武装干涉者，这些人准备一接到命令就向古巴进攻。
