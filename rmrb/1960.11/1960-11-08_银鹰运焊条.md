　　Silver Eagles Transport Welding Rods
　　Wang Guifu, a resident factory representative of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's hardware company, heard that Anshan Iron and Steel's blast furnace was undergoing a major overhaul and required ten tons of high-quality welding rods. He felt somewhat troubled. The locally produced welding rods had a tensile strength of only 25 to 32, but the water jacket for the blast furnace required a tensile strength of 50, which could only be met by the "Atlantic" brand from Shanghai. After Wang Guifu reported to the company leaders, they immediately sent a telegram to the resident representatives in Shanghai, asking them to find a solution.
　　Qian Guozhu, from the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's resident station in Shanghai, contacted the Shanghai Hardware Station immediately upon receiving the telegram. Ten tons of "Atlantic" welding rods were found.
　　Now that the welding rods were found, transportation became the problem. The home unit required the goods to be delivered within ten days, and three or four days had already passed. If sent by express train immediately, it would take at least half a month to reach Anshan; if transported by water, it would take a month. What to do?
　　Air transport! They finally thought of this solution. Therefore, they immediately contacted the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Civil Aviation Administration.
　　The leaders of the Civil Aviation Administration said after reading their letter: "Since Anshan Iron and Steel needs it urgently for production, it is our duty to provide strong support." They immediately decided to send three planes to help with the transportation.
　　At noon, three silver eagles appeared at Anshan Airport. In the blink of an eye, the three planes, carrying the desired high-quality welding rods, slid rapidly along the runway. The staff from the Anshan Iron and Steel Supply Department's Metal Section and other units, who had arrived at the airport an hour earlier, cheered and ran to the planes, repeatedly thanking the pilots who had come from afar.
　　The Shanghai welding rods, through the hands of Anshan steelworkers, welded the blast furnace water jacket firmly. The blast furnace overhaul task was completed on time. A waterfall of molten iron surged into the iron tanks and was sent to the open-hearth furnace.

    银鹰运焊条
    鞍山市五金公司驻厂员王贵福听说鞍钢高炉大修，需要十吨优质焊条。心里感到有些为难。当地生产的焊条是二十五到三十二拉力的，焊高炉水套却需要五十拉力的，非上海产的大西洋牌的不可。王贵福向公司领导报告以后，他们马上给上海的驻站代表发电报，让他们给想办法。
    鞍山市五金公司驻上海站的钱国柱，收到电报马上同上海五金站联系。十吨大西洋电焊条找到了。
    电焊条找到了，运输还是问题。家里要求十天内把货发到，现在已经过去三、四天了。如果马上用火车发快件，到鞍山起码还得半个月；由水上运输，则要一个月才能到货。怎么办呢？
    空运吧！他们终于想到了这条办法。于是，马上同冶金部上海办事处和民航局联系。
    民航局的领导同志看到他们的信以后说：“既然是鞍钢生产急用，我们义不容辞地要大力支援。”当即决定：派三架飞机帮助运输。
    中午，三架银鹰出现在鞍山机场。转眼间，载着人们渴望的优质焊条的三架飞机顺着跑道急速地滑了过来。早在一个小时前就来到机场的鞍钢供应处金属科等单位的职工，都欢呼着跑到飞机前，连声向远道而来的驾驶员们致谢。
    上海的焊条，通过鞍钢工人的手，把高炉水套焊接得牢牢实实。高炉抢修任务按时完成了。瀑布似的铁水汹涌地流进铁罐，送往平炉。
