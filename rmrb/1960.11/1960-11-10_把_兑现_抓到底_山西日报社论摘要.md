    Grasp "Fulfillment" to the End
    —Abstract of Shanxi Daily Editorial
    Any policy of the Party should be resolutely implemented and fulfilled without any discount. Only when policies are fulfilled can they truly exert their power, mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and promote the smooth progress of various tasks. At present, rural people's communes should, on the basis of the imminent completion of the "Three Autumns" work, vigorously grasp the work of income distribution, so as to fulfill the Party's distribution policy, that is, to adhere to the three-level ownership system and ensure more pay for more work. Each management area should, like the Jicun management area, launch a movement of exceeding production quotas by teams and exceeding norms by individuals, and early fulfillment of distribution, grasping distribution to promote production, guaranteeing distribution with production, combining and promoting each other, and grasping to the end.
    Meals should be eaten one bite at a time, battles should be fought one at a time, and work should be deepened step by step. The Jicun management area Party branch is very good at grasping the main contradictions in progress according to the changes in the situation in the process of income distribution, and promoting the continuous development of the movement. Over the past forty days, under the ideological guidance of adhering to putting politics in command and conscientiously implementing policies, they have continuously grasped three aspects. The first aspect was to grasp the implementation of the "three guarantees and one reward" trial calculation and fulfillment at the team level; the second aspect was to grasp the trial calculation and distribution of distribution fulfillment at the household level; the third aspect was the fulfillment movement of exceeding production by teams and increasing income by households. These three aspects were grasped more deeply and meticulously than the previous one, making income distribution fulfilled step by step, thus making the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members of each team for "Three Autumns" production higher day by day. When the autumn harvest began, whether the "three guarantees and one reward" were implemented was a matter of great concern to the cadres and commune members of each team. They promptly grasped the "three guarantees and one reward" fulfillment and implementation at the team level, giving everyone a "reassurance," and greatly improving their enthusiasm for production, promoting careful harvesting. Then, the trial calculation and distribution of the annual income distribution was implemented at the household level, which further dispelled the commune members' doubts about how much they were earning, and they worked even harder, advancing all aspects of the Three Autumns work. Resolutely implement policies, arm the masses with policies, and let policies be fulfilled, thereby powerfully promoting production, which is a successful experience of the Jicun Party branch.
    Combining distribution and production very cleverly, grasping distribution to promote production and guaranteeing distribution with production is another successful experience of the Jicun Party branch. Grasping policies and fulfilling them; starting with distribution issues is the most effective way to attract, educate, and improve the masses. Because distribution issues are the issues that the masses are most concerned about at present. However, when grasping distribution, we must also pay attention to grasping production at the same time, so that distribution and production are intertwined and promote each other. Jicun's experience proves that grasping distribution in isolation without grasping production at the same time cannot guarantee the fulfillment of distribution. Because what the masses demand for fulfillment is not only to immediately receive a portion of the money, but also to fully realize the fulfillment of distribution in accordance with the income increase plan.
    The fulfillment movement is actually a movement to persist in implementing the Party's distribution policy by solving distribution issues. Therefore, in this movement, we must not only carefully calculate accounts and cleverly arrange things, but also further strengthen political and ideological work and do a good job in publicity and education, fulfilling while publicizing, and through fulfillment, making the Party's policies more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

### 把“兑现”抓到底——山西日报社论摘要

    把“兑现”抓到底
    ——山西日报社论摘要
    党的任何一项政策，都应当坚决贯彻执行，使之不折不扣地兑现。只有政策兑现，才能真正发挥政策的威力，调动广大群众的积极性，推动各项工作顺利进行。在目前，农村人民公社应当在“三秋”工作即将结束的基础上，大抓收益分配工作，从而使党的分配政策兑现，即既要坚持三级所有制，又要保证多劳多得。每个管理区应当像冀村管理区那样，掀起一个队队超包产、个个超定额、分配早兑现运动，抓分配促生产，以生产保分配，互相结合，互相促进，一抓到底。
    饭要一口一口吃，仗要一个一个打，做工作要一步一步深入。冀村管理区党支部在进行收益分配工作中，很善于根据情况的变化，抓前进中的主要矛盾，推动运动不断向前发展。四十天来，他们在坚持政治挂帅、认真贯彻执行政策的思想指导下，连续抓了三手。头一手，是抓了“三包一奖”试算兑现落实到队；第二手，抓了分配试算试分落实到户；第三手，就是队队超产、户户增收的兑现运动。这三手一手比一手抓得深入细致，使收益分配一步步兑现，因而使各队干部和社员的“三秋”生产积极性一天比一天高涨。当秋收开始的时候，“三包一奖”是否执行，是各队干部和社员十分关心的问题。他们及时抓了“三包一奖”兑现落实到队，让大家吃了“定心丸”，生产积极性大大提高，促进了细收细打。接着，全年收益分配试算试分落实到户，又解除了社员闹不清自己收入多少的疑虑，干劲更大了，三秋工作项项赶前。坚决贯彻政策，用政策武装群众，让政策兑现，从而有力地推动了生产，这是冀村党支部的一条成功经验。
    把分配与生产很巧妙的结合起来，抓分配促生产、以生产保分配，这是冀村党支部的另一条成功经验。抓政策，搞兑现；先从分配问题着手，这是最能吸引群众、教育群众、提高群众的有效方法。因为分配问题是目前群众最关心的问题。但是，抓分配的时候，必须同时注意抓生产，使分配与生产扭在一起，互相促进。冀村的经验证明，孤立地抓分配，不同时抓生产，是不能保证分配兑现的。因为群众要求的兑现，不仅是要立即分到一部分钱，而是要求按照增收计划，全部实现分配兑现。
    兑现运动，实际上是通过解决分配问题，坚持贯彻执行党的分配政策的运动。因此，在这一运动中，不仅要细算账、巧安排，而且要进一步加强政治思想工作和做好宣传教育工作，边兑现，边宣传，通过兑现，使党的政策更加深入人心。
