    A Skilled Cook Arrives at the Canteen
    Grandpa Wang from the Beidui Vegetable Garden Team of the Yongchang Brigade of the Dengchuan Commune in Jianchuan County, Yunnan Province, has been beaming with joy these past few days. It turns out that Grandpa Wang was determined to solve a mystery, so he secretly asked the clerk, "The meals have been different every day these past few days, and they smell so good. What seasoning are you adding?" "Okay, Grandpa Wang, I've answered this question for many commune members. The vegetables and rice are the same as usual, but we have a more skilled cook."
    Someone said, "The new cook is the County Party Secretary." Aunt Wang said, "No way, would the County Party Secretary help the farmers at the stove?" Communist Youth League member Ma Jixiu refuted Aunt Wang's old-fashioned view: "How can the Communist Party cadres be compared to those of the past? Good leadership, strong labor, digging fields, accumulating fertilizer, cooking, all-rounders in both literary and military skills. Speaking of labor, hey! Aunt Wang, they are no worse than us."
    Indeed, Secretary Jin, since becoming a cook in Beidui, although it's only been a few days, there have been great changes in production and life.
    Originally, this canteen ate two *jin* of vegetables per person every day: tomatoes, pumpkins, green beans, and cabbage… As for grain consumption, everyone had plenty every day, but there was a lack of planning. As soon as Secretary Jin arrived at the canteen, he humbly listened to opinions, relied on the masses, and made clever arrangements, producing nine different dishes in three days.
    Secretary Jin's arrival at the Beidui canteen improved the quality of life and promoted production. The commune members all said, "The Secretary shares weal and woe with us, and the more we work, the more we think, the sweeter our hearts become."

    食堂来了个手巧炊事员
    云南剑川县邓川公社永昌大队北队菜园组有位王大爷，这两天喜笑颜开。原来，王大爷有心要猜破一个谜，悄悄地去问事务员：“这两天顿顿饭菜都不一样，喷香喷香的，究竟有什么作料加在里面？”“好！王大爷，你问的事我已答复了好多社员，这两天菜、饭都和往常一样，就是多了个手巧的炊事员。”
    有人讲：“新来的炊事员是县委书记。”王大妈说：“那里，县委书记还会替农民摸锅边。”共青团员马吉秀，反驳了王大妈的旧观点：“共产党的干部哪能和过去相比，领导好，劳动强，挖田，积肥，做饭，文武全才，说起劳动，嘿！王大妈，人家不比咱差半点。”
    真的，靳书记到北队当了炊事员，虽说只有几天，但生产、生活都有了大改变。
    原来这个食堂每天每人吃菜有两斤，蕃茄、南瓜、豆角，还有包包白……。说到吃粮，每人每天都不少，就缺少个计划安排。靳书记一下食堂就虚心倾听意见，依靠群众，巧作安排，三天做出了九样菜。
    靳书记下了北队食堂，生活搞好了，促进了生产。社员都说：“书记都和我们同甘共苦，我们干活，越干、越想、心越甜。”
