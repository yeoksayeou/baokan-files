    Soviet-Made "Talking" Machine Helps the Blind
    Blind People Use Machine to Hear Sounds and Understand Newspaper and Magazine Content
    Engineers in Sverdlovsk, Soviet Union, have created a "talking" machine for the blind that can read ordinary newspapers and magazines.

    The working principle of this machine is to convert the light shining on the text into an electric current, and then convert the current into sound. Blind people can understand the content of books and newspapers by hearing the sound. When in use, as long as the book or newspaper is placed into the machine's "mouth", an optical system with a tiny motor will move line by line along the text on the book or newspaper. When the image of a letter enters the optical system, it will form various different sounds, which are amplified and emitted through a loudspeaker. The machine can read three to four hundred syllables per minute.

    The Biological Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences has isolated a substance that can promote the use of mold to produce citric acid, solving a problem that the scientific community has been working hard to solve for decades.

    Until now, the large-scale production of citric acid has relied on natural production. The achievement of Czechoslovak biologists makes it possible for the first time to control this process artificially.

    This substance can also stimulate the growth of mold and neutralize the effects of certain antibiotics such as streptomycin. This is the first substance discovered that has this effect. The mechanism of action of streptomycin and other drugs is still completely unknown. The scientific community has been seeking ways to solve this problem, and this new discovery makes it possible to study this problem.

    苏联制成“会说话”的机器帮助盲人
    盲人靠机器听到声音了解书报内容
    苏联斯维德洛夫斯克工程师们制造了一种供盲人使用的、可以阅读普通书报的“会说话”的机器。
    这种机器的工作原理是把照在文字上的光线变换成电流，再把电流变成声音，盲人听到声音就可以了解到书报的内容了。在使用时只要把书报放到机器口里，一个带有极微小的马达的光学系统就会沿着书报上的文字一行一行地移动。字母的形象进入光学系统就会形成各种不同的声音，经过加强，通过扬声器发出来。机器每分钟可阅读三、四百个音节。
    捷克斯洛伐克科学院生物研究所分离出了一种可以促成利用霉菌来生产柠檬酸的物质，解决了科学界最近几十年来一直在努力解决的这个问题。
    到目前为止，柠檬酸的大规模生产一直依靠天然生产，捷克斯洛伐克生物学家的这一成就，第一次使这一过程能够用人工加以掌握。
    这种物质同时还可以刺激霉菌的生长，中和某些抗菌素如链霉素的作用。这是第一次发现的具有这种作用的物质。链霉素等的作用机制到目前为止还完全不知道，科学界一直在寻求解决这一问题的方法，这一新发现使得对这一问题的研究成为可能。
