    Implementing Policies and Arranging Winter Production
    Baodi County Communes Make Various Preparations for Continued Great Leap Forward Next Year
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Baodi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in the spirit of "looking at the next step while taking the current step, grasping the present with one hand and the future with the other," is leading the people's communes to conscientiously implement the Party's policies and start early in arranging various winter production tasks and the masses' livelihood. Now, in order to seize a continued leap forward in agricultural production in 1961, commune members have launched new production activities.
    Baodi County's "three autumns" work this year was carried out quickly and well. The wheat planting plan has been completed ahead of schedule, and the autumn harvest has also been basically completed. By mid-October, the county had also completed 150,000 mu of autumn plowing in conjunction with the autumn harvest. In order to seize a bumper harvest next year, the County Committee organized Party committees at all levels to discuss the current new situation in rural areas, and clearly put forward three tasks for winter production: First, to do everything possible to manage winter wheat well and fire the first shot in next year's great agricultural harvest; second, to prepare sufficient fertilizer for wheat and spring-sown crops; and third, to develop diversified operations to accumulate funds for large-scale agriculture and increase commune members' income. When arranging winter production in detail, the County Committee and Party organizations at all levels handed over various relevant policies, such as "three guarantees and one reward," to the masses, mobilized teams and commune members to discuss them, and implemented production tasks based on the policies. More than 1,000 cadres, led by the secretaries of the county, communes, management districts, and production teams, went deep into the teams level by level to check the implementation of policies in the winter production arrangements. Sun Rong, the First Secretary of the Zhao Ge Zhuang Commune Party Committee, while going deep into the Gou Tou Production Team to help study wheat management measures, found that the production quotas of some teams were too high, so he helped the production team and team cadres mobilize the masses to discuss and revise them. After the policies and tasks were implemented one by one, the production enthusiasm of the masses was further mobilized. The cadres and masses of twelve teams started by summarizing the experience of this year's wheat bumper harvest, formulated management measures, and held a mobilization meeting to compete for exceeding the production quota. A high tide of winter wheat management, centered on hoeing, rolling, and pest control, was launched.
    In order to accumulate more and better fertilizer, the County Committee summarized and promoted the fertilizer accumulation experience of some teams. Now, all 600+ production teams in the county's communes have distributed fertilizer accumulation tasks according to teams, according to breeding units, and according to people, and reasonably stipulated the team's fertilizer accumulation remuneration and the method of pricing commune members' fertilizer accumulation according to quality. After the Qu Kou Commune promoted the experience of the Bei Qu Kou Production Team in adhering to the fertilizer accumulation policy for the past two years, more than 7,000 commune member households in the commune put all 11 million jin of fertilizer into the production team, and took the initiative to formulate a winter individual fertilizer accumulation plan, immediately creating a mass fertilizer accumulation upsurge in the commune. The avenues for winter diversified operations have also been expanded due to the reasonable division of business scope, and the sideline production activities of the communes have already begun.
    While vigorously grasping production, the County Committee also made specific arrangements for the people's livelihood. The first is that the secretaries at all levels vigorously grasp the canteens, and through team-by-team inspections and arrangements, ensure that commune members eat their fill, eat well, and eat warmly. At the same time, the County Committee also paid attention to arranging the combination of work and rest for commune members in winter. The general slogan put forward by the County Committee for winter work is good production, good life, and good rest. Production activities are arranged, and rest time is also arranged. Thanks to the Party Committee's concern for the broad masses, the commune members' labor enthusiasm for winter production is getting higher and higher.

    贯彻政策安排冬季生产
    宝坻县各公社为明年继续跃进作各种准备
    据新华社讯　中共河北省宝坻县委，本着“走上步看下步，一手抓当前，一手抓明年”的精神，领导各人民公社，认真贯彻党的政策，及早动手安排冬季各项生产和群众生活。现在各公社社员为了夺取1961年农业生产继续跃进，已经展开了新的生产活动。
    宝坻县今年“三秋”工作进行得又快又好，小麦种植计划已经提前超额完成，秋收也已基本结束，到10月中旬全县还结合秋收完成秋耕十五万亩。为夺取明年大丰收，县委组织各级党委讨论当前农村的新形势，并明确地提出了今冬生产的三项任务：一是要千方百计搞好小麦越冬管理，打响明年农业大丰收的第一炮；二是给小麦和春播作物准备下充足肥料；三是开展多种经营，为大办农业积累资金和增加社员收入。县委和各级党组织在具体安排冬季生产时，都把“三包一奖”等各项有关政策交给群众，发动小队和社员进行讨论，根据政策，落实生产任务。以县、公社、管理区、生产队等四级书记为首的一千多名干部，还层层深入小队，对冬季生产安排中执行政策的情况做了检查。赵各庄公社党委第一书记孙荣，在深入到沟头生产队帮助研究小麦管理措施中，当他发现有的小队包产指标偏高，就帮助生产队和小队干部发动群众讨论，作了修改。政策任务件件落实后，进一步调动了群众生产积极性。十二个小队的干部和群众，还从总结今年小麦丰收经验入手，制订了管理措施，举行了争超包产的誓师大会。掀起了以锄、轧、除虫为中心的小麦越冬管理高潮。
    为了多积肥积好肥，县委总结、推广了一些小队的积肥经验。现在全县各公社六百多个生产队，都按小队、按饲养单位、按人分配了积肥任务，合理规定了小队积肥计酬和社员积肥以质论价的方法。渠口公社在推广了北渠口生产队两年来坚持贯彻积肥政策的经验以后，全社就有七千多户社员，把一千一百万斤肥料全部投入到生产队，并主动地制订了冬季个人积肥计划，立即在全社出现了群众性的积肥热潮。冬季多种经营的门路，也因为合理划分了经营范围，有了扩大，现在各公社的副业生产活动已经开始。
    县委在大抓生产的同时，还对群众生活问题，作了具体安排。首先是各级书记大抓食堂，通过逐队检查，逐队安排，保证社员吃饱、吃好、吃暖。同时，县委还注意了安排社员冬季劳逸结合的问题。县委对冬季工作提出的总的口号是生产好、生活好、休息好。安排生产活动，同时也安排休息时间。由于党委对广大群众的关怀，社员们冬季生产的劳动情绪越来越高。
