Xinhua News Agency, 17th. According to Western news agencies reporting from Vientiane, Laotian Prime Minister Prince Phouma condemned the United States on the 16th at a press conference for supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group.

Phouma said that the United States has been unconditionally supporting the rebellion of Phoumi Nosavan and has been doing so since the rebellion began. He also said, "The United States has established a close alliance with Savannakhet (the rebel group)," and this "is certainly illegal."

Phouma said that he had repeatedly asked the U.S. Embassy in Laos to support the Royal Government, but his views had no effect. He added that due to the United States' support for the Savannakhet rebels, Phoumi Nosavan has become even more unwilling to compromise with the legitimate Lao government.

Phouma stated that if Phoumi Nosavan continues to refuse to negotiate, "then there must be fighting. The strongest will win."

When asked by a reporter about the situation in Luang Prabang since the outbreak of the rebellion there, Phouma replied, "You must ask the Americans, because they have a radio station in Luang Prabang." He also said, "The Americans have direct contact with Luang Prabang."

According to the Associated Press, an official from the United States Information Service and other American "representatives" are now in Luang Prabang. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Laos said that the embassy has regular contact with them."

According to the Associated Press from Washington, U.S. State Department officials on the 16th refused to make a formal response to Prime Minister Phouma's condemnation of U.S. support for the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group. However, U.S. State Department officials argued that if the U.S. "aid" to the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group is "suddenly considered illegal, then our (U.S.) view is to the contrary." These officials even shamelessly said that the United States sees nothing illegal in its military support for the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th. Laotian Combat Forces Radio published a commentary on the 16th, calling on all Lao people to continue to strengthen unity and struggle to crush the new offensive conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique.

The commentary also hoped that the Phouma government would, together with the people, resolutely direct the spearhead of struggle at the running dog of U.S. imperialism, the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, resolutely implement the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and smash all the enemy's conspiracies.

The commentary pointed out that in many places, the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group is stepping up "sweeps" and persecuting the people, forcing people to join the army. They are also mobilizing troops to Pakading, preparing to launch a large-scale new offensive. At the same time, the rebel group is also directing its running dogs to step up divisive activities, attempting to create chaos among the patriotic forces.

The commentary said that the recent riots in Luang Prabang further prove that no concessions should be made to the traitorous clique. Hesitation and lack of vigilance in the face of their vicious activities will cause disaster to the Lao nation and people. The correct attitude is to regard them as traitors and resolutely oppose them.

    富马首相在记者招待会上发表谈话
    谴责美国支持诺萨万叛乱集团
    寮国战斗部队电台号召人民坚决制止美国干涉
    新华社17日讯　据西方通讯社自万象报道，老挝首相富马亲王16日在一次记者招待会上谴责美国一直在支持富米
  ·诺萨万叛乱集团。
    富马说，美国无条件地支持富米·诺萨万的叛乱活动，而且自从这个叛乱开始以来，美国一直这样做。他还说，“美国同沙湾拿吉（的叛乱集团）建立了密切的联盟”，而这“肯定是非法的”。
    富马说，他曾经数度要求美国驻老挝大使馆支持王国政府，但是他的意见没有发生作用。他又说，由于美国对沙湾拿吉叛乱分子的支持，富米·诺萨万变得更加不肯同合法的老挝政府妥协了。
    富马表示，如果富米·诺萨万继续拒绝谈判，“那就必须作战。力量最强的将会获胜。”
    有记者问到琅勃拉邦的叛乱发生以来那里的局势时，富马回答说，“你必须去问美国人，因为他们在琅勃拉邦有广播电台。”他还说，“美国人同琅勃拉邦有直接的联系。”
    据美联社报道，美国新闻处的一位官员和其他美国“代表”现在琅勃拉邦。美国驻老挝大使馆的发言人说，大使馆同他们有定期的联系。”
    另据美联社自华盛顿报道，美国国务院官员在16日拒绝对富马首相谴责美国支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的谈话作出正式的答复。但是，美国国务院的官员狡辩说，如果美国“援助”富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的行为被“突然认为是非法的，那么我们（美国）的看法却与此相反。”这些官员甚至厚颜无耻地说，美国看不出在它给予富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的军事支持方面有什么不合法的地方。
    据新华社河内17日电　寮国战斗部队电台在16日发表评论，号召全体老挝人民继续加强团结和斗争，粉碎美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团新的进攻阴谋。
    评论还希望富马政府同人民一道，坚决把斗争的矛头指向美帝国主义的走狗富米·诺萨万叛国集团，坚决实现和平中立和民族和睦的政策，粉碎敌人的一切阴谋。
    评论指出，目前在许多地方，富米·诺萨万叛乱集团正在加紧“扫荡”和迫害人民，强迫人民当兵。他们还调动军队到巴加丁，准备发动大规模的新的攻势。与此同时，叛乱集团还指使它的走狗加紧离间活动，企图制造各爱国力量之间的混乱。
    评论说，最近在琅勃拉邦发生的暴乱事件，进一步证明了对叛国集团是不应该采取任何让步的态度的。在对待他们的恶毒活动时犹豫不决和缺乏警惕，都会造成老挝民族和人民的灾祸。正确的态度是，把他们看做叛国分子，必须坚决反对他们。
