If You're Going to Grasp It, Grasp It Tightly

"Grasping tightly" is an important working method for Party committees. The Party committee must not only grasp major tasks, but also grasp them tightly. It is not acceptable not to grasp, nor is it acceptable to grasp without tightening.

The coordination of various links in industrial enterprises is an important task in current production. The Party committee must grasp this task, but the question of how to grasp it and to what extent should be noted. Some may remain at the level of general appeals, while others may grasp but not tightly. Like the Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3, it first implemented the "contracting-by-furnace system," fixing the three-shift collaboration in the system; further, it implemented the "one-dragon" regional management system; improved the administrative management work, and fixed the collaborative relationship between the upper, lower, left, and right processes in the production organization and management. This tightly grasped the problem of collaboration in all links and solved it well. It has also had an immediate and positive effect on production.

The news from Tianjin Steel Plant No. 3 introduces a good experience for ensuring the increased production of the steel plant. The reason why this experience is good is not only because it effectively solved a major problem in the steel plant's production, but also because it embodies a good leadership method instructed by Chairman Mao. That is: major tasks must be grasped to the end and grasped very tightly.

### 要抓就抓紧

    要抓就抓紧
    “抓紧”，是党委会的一项重要工作方法。党委对主要工作不但一定要抓，而且一定要抓紧。不抓不行，抓而不紧也不行。
    工业企业各个环节的协作，是当前生产中的一项重要工作。党委会要抓这项工作，但如何抓法，抓到什么程度，就是应当注意的问题。有的可能停留于一般号召，有的可能是抓而不紧。像津钢三厂那样，先是实行了“包炉制”，把三班协作从体制上固定起来；进一步又实行了“一条龙”区域性管理体制；改进了行政管理工作，把上下左右各工序之间的协作关系也在生产组织管理上固定下来。这就把各个环节的协作问题紧紧地抓起来了，并且很好地解决了。在生产上也就立竿见影，产生了良好的效果。
    津钢三厂的消息介绍了保证钢厂增产的一条好经验。这条经验所以好，不仅因为它有效地解决了钢厂生产中的一个重大问题，而且因为它体现了毛主席指示的一个好领导方法。这就是：对主要工作要一抓到底，抓得很紧。
