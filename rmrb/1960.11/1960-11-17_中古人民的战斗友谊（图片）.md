More than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Cuba and overseas Chinese held a meeting in the Chinese residential area of Havana on October 2 to celebrate China's National Day. This is the rostrum of the conference, built in the form of Tiananmen Square.

The Chinese Film Festival, which began in Havana on October 15, has been warmly welcomed by Cuban audiences. This is a huge advertisement decorated in front of the cinema, with the words "People's China" written on it.
