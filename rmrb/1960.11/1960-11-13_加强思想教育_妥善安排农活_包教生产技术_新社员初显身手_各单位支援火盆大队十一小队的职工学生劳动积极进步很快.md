    Strengthen Ideological Education, Properly Arrange Farm Work, Teach Production Techniques
    New Commune Members Initially Show Their Skills
    Workers and Students Supporting the Huopen Brigade's Eleventh Team are Making Rapid Progress in Labor and Activeness

    (Reported by our newspaper) The Eleventh Production Team of the Huopen Brigade of the Huopen People's Commune in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, has earnestly strengthened ideological education and promptly and properly arranged work for the commune members who were recently transferred from factories, schools, and state organs to support the front line of agricultural production, enabling them to play an active role in agricultural production. In the past month or so, they have each worked more than twenty workdays, and some have even been rated as "Five-Good" commune members and received commendations and awards.
    This team recently added sixteen new commune members. The team held a welcoming meeting to warmly welcome them back to participate in agricultural production. They also expressed their determination to settle down in agricultural production and contribute their strength to developing agriculture and grain production on a large scale. In order to strengthen their political and ideological education, the production team's Party group led them in forming study groups to organize them to study Chairman Mao's works, the Party's guidelines and policies, and agricultural science knowledge during their spare time. They also used concrete facts, combined with the team's situation, to explain to them the important significance of supporting agricultural production. Although commune members Duan Antian and Quan Zaiqing originally knew that there was a shortage of rural labor, they lacked a real sense of it and did not have a deep understanding. After returning to the team, they saw that the crops in the fields were growing so well, and the cotton king cultivated by the commune members had more than 1,200 bolls on one plant. They deeply felt that the potential for agricultural production was endless and that the amount of rural labor needed to be greatly increased. Both of them promised to settle down in agricultural production and launched a competition with each other, catching up with each other and quickly learning the techniques of managing cotton and sweet potatoes.
    The production team also properly arranged farm work according to the characteristics of each individual. These commune members are younger, have a certain level of education, and are quick to accept new things. The team assigned them to high-yield groups, and under the leadership of veteran commune members, they cultivated large areas of high-yield fields and various crop kings. They did not understand production techniques, so the Party group appointed production experts Wang Chengmin, Li Yunfang, Ding Jixian, and others to teach them the techniques. In the specific arrangement of farm work, they were used according to their abilities and arranged for each person to do what they could.
    In addition, attention was also paid to solving their specific difficulties in production. For example, if they did not have farm tools, the commune members would lend them their good farm tools for use. The team also promptly purchased a hoe for each of them and added other small farm tools according to different needs.
    Under the kind care of the Party and Youth League organizations and the team cadres, the newly returned commune members were deeply moved, and everyone worked actively and strived to make contributions. When they returned to the countryside, they encountered rainy weather, and they had to get their clothes wet when they went into the cotton fields to remove old leaves and accumulate green manure. The cadres advised them not to go, but they all said, "The more it rains, the faster the old leaves of cotton should be removed, otherwise the cotton bolls will rot, affecting cotton production and fertilizer for the spring crops." They insisted on removing the old leaves from more than 20 mu of cotton and accumulated more than 50,000 jin of green manure. September was the busiest time for farm work in the entire team. At that time, the team still lacked more than 750 workdays for field management, harvesting cotton, and plowing the land. This group of new commune members immediately participated in fertilization, picking cotton, weeding, and autumn vegetable management, so that the team could free up more labor for other farm work. As a result, they not only completed the tasks of sweet potato topdressing, cotton harvesting, and autumn vegetable management on time, in good quality, and in sufficient quantity, but also prepared 420,000 jin of green manure for the spring crops.
    The addition of this force to the team not only eased the contradiction of insufficient labor in the team, but also contributed their cultural and scientific knowledge to the countryside, promoting rural cultural activities. At the same time, their active labor and practical actions in caring about production also encouraged the commune members who had originally persisted in the front line of agricultural production to devote themselves to autumn production centered on autumn planting with even greater labor enthusiasm.

### 加强思想教育　妥善安排农活　包教生产技术  新社员初显身手  各单位支援火盆大队十一小队的职工学生劳动积极进步很快

    加强思想教育　妥善安排农活　包教生产技术
    新社员初显身手
    各单位支援火盆大队十一小队的职工学生劳动积极进步很快
    本报讯　四川省简阳县火盆人民公社火盆大队第十一生产小队，对刚从工厂、学校以及国家机关抽调来支援农业生产第一线的社员，切实加强思想教育，及时妥善安排工作，使他们在农业生产上发挥积极作用。近一个多月来，他们每人已做了二十多个劳动日，有的还被评为“五好”社员，受到表扬奖励。
    这个小队不久前增加了十六个新社员，队上举行了欢迎大会，热烈欢迎他们回来参加农业生产。他们也纷纷表示要安心农业生产，在大办农业、大办粮食中贡献自己的力量。为了加强对他们的政治思想教育工作，生产队党小组领导他们编了学习小组，组织他们利用工余时间学习毛主席著作、党的方针、政策以及农业科学知识。还结合本队的情况，用具体事实，向他们讲解支援农业生产的重要意义。社员段安田和全在清原来虽然知道农村劳动力不足，但是缺乏实感，体会不够深刻；他回队后，看到地里庄稼长得那样好，社员培植的棉花王一株结桃一千二百多个，深深感到农业生产潜力无穷，农村劳动量需要大大增加，两个人都保证安心农业生产，并互相展开竞赛，你追我赶，很快就学会了管理棉花和红苕的技术。
    生产队还根据他们每个人的特点，妥善安排农活。这些社员较年轻，有一定的文化水平，接受新事物快。小队便把他们分配到高产小组，在老社员的带动下，培植大面积高产田和各种作物王。他们不懂生产技术，党小组就指定生产能手王成民、李云芳、丁继先等向他们传授技术。在具体安排农活时，量材使用，给每个人安排了力所能及的活路。
    此外，还注意解决他们生产中的具体困难。如他们没有农具，社员就把自己的好农具借给他们使用，小队还及时给他们每人购买了一把锄头，并分别不同需要，添置了其他小农具。
    在党团组织和小队干部的亲切关怀下，新回来的社员深受感动，人人积极劳动，个个争取立功。他们回农村的时候，正碰到阴雨天气，走进棉田打老叶、积青肥就要打湿衣服。干部劝他们不要去，他们都说：“天越是下雨，棉花老叶越要快打，要不就会把棉桃沤烂，影响棉花产量和小春用肥。”他们坚持打了二十多亩棉花的老叶，积了青肥五万多斤。9月份正是全队农活最繁忙的时候，当时全队田间管理，收获棉花和翻犁板田等农活，尚缺少七百五十多个工。这批新社员立即参加施肥、收花、扯草和秋菜管理，使队上能腾出更多的劳动力作其他的农活。结果，不仅按时、按质、按量的完成了红苕追肥、棉花收获、秋菜管理任务，而且还为小春准备了四十二万斤青肥。
    小队增加了这批力量，不仅缓和了本队劳动力不足的矛盾，而且还把他们的文化科学知识贡献于农村，推动了农村的文化活动。同时，他们积极劳动，关心生产的实际行动，也鼓舞了原来坚持农业生产第一线的社员，以更加饱满的劳动热情投入以秋种为中心的秋季生产。（附图片）
