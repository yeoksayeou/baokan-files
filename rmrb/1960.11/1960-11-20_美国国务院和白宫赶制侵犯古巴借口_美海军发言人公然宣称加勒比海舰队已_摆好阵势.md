Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: While the U.S. government is actively preparing for an armed invasion of Cuba by dispatching naval and air forces to the Caribbean, it is striving to create pretexts and prepare public opinion politically for such action.

On the 18th, the U.S. State Department issued a statement, shamelessly accusing the Cuban government of pursuing "aggressive policies" and slandering socialist countries for "obviously hoping to intensify tensions in the Caribbean," the "reason" being that the Cuban government supposedly purchased some weapons from socialist countries. The U.S. State Department's statement clearly believes that a person threatened by heavily armed thugs has no right to acquire weapons for self-defense and should be at their mercy. The United States, which has always been frantically expanding its arms and shipping its munitions to all corners of the world, is now shouting and yelling with this kind of gangster logic, with the aim of deceiving public opinion in order to create a pretext for open U.S. armed aggression against Cuba.

White House Press Secretary Hagerty also spoke to reporters on the same day. He turned around and attacked the condemnation by Cuba and the Soviet Union of this U.S. military provocation, calling these condemnations a "typical communist reaction," and even said that the "wording used" in the condemnations by Cuba and the Soviet Union was "almost identical." But when reporters asked him what he thought of Cuba's accusation that the U.S. action endangered world peace, Hagerty, feeling guilty, dared not answer.

A U.S. Navy spokesman said aggressively on the 18th that the U.S. Navy's fleet in the Caribbean is currently "ready." He indicated that if the puppet regimes of Guatemala and Nicaragua make "explicit requests," the U.S. Navy will further "take action." He also indicated that when the dictatorial regimes of Guatemala and Nicaragua make "requests," the U.S. Navy will have the "rights and privileges" to enter and conduct activities in the territorial waters of Guatemala and Nicaragua in order to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries. It can also be seen from the attitude adopted by Secretary of State Herter on the same day that the U.S. air and naval forces will maintain a tense situation and preparations for offensive in the Caribbean for a long period of time.

    美国国务院和白宫赶制侵犯古巴借口
    美海军发言人公然宣称加勒比海舰队已“摆好阵势”
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府在出动海、空军前往加勒比海地区积极准备武装进攻古巴的同时，正努力为这种行动在政治上制造借口和进行舆论准备。
    18日，美国国务院发表一项声明，竟然反噬古巴政府推行“侵略政策”，并且诽谤社会主义国家“显然希望加剧加勒比的紧张局势”，“理由”是据说古巴政府向社会主义国家购买了一些武器。美国国务院的声明显然认为，一个受到武装到牙齿的强盗们的威胁的人无权置备武器自卫，而应该听任他们摆布。一贯疯狂地扩军备战并把它的军火运到世界各个角落去的美国，现在用这种强盗逻辑大喊大叫，目的无非是想蒙蔽舆论，以便为美国公开武装侵略古巴制造借口。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂同一天也对新闻记者发表谈话。他倒过头来攻击古巴和苏联方面对美国这一军事挑衅行动的谴责，把这些谴责叫做“典型的共产党反应”，还说什么古巴和苏联的谴责“所用的字句差不多相同”。但当新闻记者问到他对古巴指责美国的行动危害世界和平有什么看法时，作贼心虚的哈格蒂却不敢回答。
    美国海军部发言人18日气势汹汹地说，美国海军在加勒比海的舰队目前已经“摆好了阵势”。他表明，如果危地马拉和尼加拉瓜的傀儡政权提出“明确要求”，美国海军将进一步“采取行动”。他还表明，在危地马拉和尼加拉瓜独裁政权提出“要求”时，美国海军将有在危地马拉和尼加拉瓜领海出入和进行活动的“权利和特权”，以干涉这些国家的内政。从国务卿赫脱同一天所采取的态度中也可以看出，美国的海空部队将要长时期地在加勒比海保持紧张局势和进攻准备。
