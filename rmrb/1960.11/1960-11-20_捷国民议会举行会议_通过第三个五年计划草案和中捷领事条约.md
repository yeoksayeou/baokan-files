Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 18th: The fourth session of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic began here on the 16th.

    State Planning Commission Chairman Šimůnek delivered a report on the government's draft law concerning the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) for the development of the Czechoslovak national economy. After discussion, the session unanimously approved the draft on the 17th.

    The meeting also approved the final accounts of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic for 1959 and the government's draft law on changing the national emblem.

    At the meeting on the 17th, the Sino-Czech Consular Treaty was approved. Anna Karlovská, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, delivered a report to all the delegates on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee regarding this consular treaty. She said, "We are pleased with the important achievements made by the People's Republic of China in developing its economy and the increasingly important role it plays in world politics. The People's Republic of China is an important force in the struggle against imperialist aggression and in safeguarding world peace. The relationship between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the People's Republic of China is based on the spirit of proletarian internationalism, built on the foundation of fraternal cooperation and mutual assistance, which was solidified by the Sino-Czech Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed in Beijing in 1957."

    The report went on to say that the Sino-Czech Consular Treaty will stipulate the existing broad consular exchanges between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the People's Republic of China in an agreement, which is the basis for further developing relations between the two countries. This treaty and the consular treaties signed by Czechoslovakia with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries originate from the same principles.

    After outlining the content of some important provisions, the report said: "The signing of a consular treaty with the People's Republic of China is another step in expanding the agreement system between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the People's Republic of China. It promotes the consolidation and development of friendly relations and comprehensive cooperation between the two countries."

    捷国民议会举行会议
    通过第三个五年计划草案和中捷领事条约
    新华社布拉格18日电　捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国国民议会第四次会议16日开始在这里举行会议。
    国家计划委员会主席西穆涅克就政府关于发展捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）法案草案作了报告。经过讨论，会议于17日一致通过了这个草案。
    会议还批准了捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国1959年的年终结算，和关于改换国徽的政府法案草案。
    在17日的会议上通过了中捷领事条约。国民议会外交委员会委员安娜·卡尔洛夫斯卡代表外交委员会向全体代表作了关于这一领事条约的报告。她说：“我们为中华人民共和国在发展自己的经济中所获得的重要成就和它在世界政治中起着愈来愈大的作用而感到高兴。中华人民共和国是在反对帝国主义侵略和维护世界和平的斗争中的一支重要力量。捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国和中华人民共和国之间的关系是根据无产阶级国际主义精神，建立在兄弟般的合作和相互帮助的基础之上的，1957年在北京签订的中捷友好合作条约为此打下了巩固的基础。”
    报告接着说，中捷领事条约将捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国和中华人民共和国之间现有的广泛领事往来用协议规定下来，它是进一步发展两国之间的关系的基础。这一条约和捷克斯洛伐克同苏联和其它社会主义阵营国家间所签订的领事条约出自于同一原则。
    报告在概述了一些重要条款的内容后说：“同中华人民共和国签订领事条约是扩大捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国和中华人民共和国之间的协议体系的又一步骤。它促进两国间友好关系和全面合作的巩固和发展。”
