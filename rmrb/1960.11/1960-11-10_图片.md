    The Yang Desheng converter steelmaking team of the Second Branch of the Tianjin Second Steel Plant, which has consistently produced flawless steel for a thousand heats, has continued to scale new heights and achieved new victories in the fourth quarter. By November 8th, they had continuously smelted one thousand two hundred and seventy-nine heats of steel, and every heat was up to standard. The consumption of pig iron per ton of steel has also decreased compared to October.
