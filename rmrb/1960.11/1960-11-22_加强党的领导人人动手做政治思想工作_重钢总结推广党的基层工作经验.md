    Strengthen Party Leadership, Everyone Do Political and Ideological Work
    Chongqing Iron and Steel Summarizes and Promotes the Party's Grassroots Work Experience
    (Our report) Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, in the midst of a vigorous mass movement, has earnestly strengthened Party work, giving full play to the fighting bastion role of Party branches and the core role of Party groups, ensuring the sustained rise in production. In order to better exert the role of grassroots Party organizations, the Chongqing Iron and Steel Party Committee recently convened a conference of advanced branch secretaries and Party group leaders to analyze and summarize the work experience of grassroots Party organizations. On this basis, a branch work conference was also convened to introduce these advanced experiences, launching a vigorous upsurge of learning and promoting these advanced experiences in all branches and Party groups throughout the company, in order to further improve the level of the entire branch work and lay a solid foundation for ensuring the completion of this year's production plan and preparing for next year's production.
      Carry Out Political and Ideological Work Throughout the Entire Production Process
    An important experience of advanced branches and groups is to vigorously strengthen the Party's political and ideological work, especially according to the characteristics of steelmaking production and the requirement to seize every second, not only strengthening political and ideological work before and after shifts, but also paying special attention to strengthening political and ideological work during shifts, and carrying out political and ideological work throughout every furnace of steel and every production process, greatly exerting the combat power of the Party's political and ideological work. For example, the Party Committee of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, in view of the characteristics of strong continuity and short cycle of converter production, and the extremely tense production, put forward the slogan "One furnace of steel is a battle, one shift is a campaign." For each furnace of steel made, each ladle of molten iron poured, and each ingot mold cast, they grasped it tightly from the beginning to the end, and according to the problems that arose in production and the ideological situation of the workers, they convened Party group meetings by the furnace at any time, first unifying thinking within the Party, and then mobilizing the masses separately, making political and ideological work lively, full of combat effectiveness (problems grasped accurately and solved in a timely manner), foresight (doing ideological work before problems occur) and mass character (cadres, Party members and all workers, everyone doing ideological work, everywhere doing ideological work). The smelting section branch of the No. 1 Open Hearth Plant, according to the characteristics of open hearth production, also put forward the slogan "One furnace of steel is a campaign, one process is a battle." In the process of producing a furnace of steel, in addition to regularly holding three Party group meetings, the Party group also frequently understood the ideological trends of the masses and conducted in-depth and meticulous ideological work in links that were prone to causing ideological fluctuations among the masses. For example, when the sulfur content was high, there was generally a tendency to develop a fear of difficulty. They promptly convened furnace-side meetings, proposing: "The more sulfur, the greater the effort, the devil is one foot tall, the Dao is ten feet tall," and striving for victory even under difficult conditions. When the sulfur content was low, there was generally a tendency to become complacent and slack. They educated the masses to "treat a dead tiger as a live tiger," making full use of favorable conditions to win greater victories. In this way, every worker was able to carry out intense production with high morale under any circumstances.
    Give Full Play to the Role of Advanced Fighters of Party Members and Strive to Be Intimate Friends of the Masses
    Another important experience of advanced branches and groups is to give full play to the role of advanced fighters of every Party member and adopt the method of the mass line, with everyone doing political and ideological work. In order to better exert the exemplary leading role of Party members, they strengthened the education of Party members, strictly observed Party organizational life, and educated every Party member to set an example in everything and closely connect with the masses, leading the broad masses to advance together. The Party branch of No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Plant created the experience of "Three Guarantees, Four Leading Roles" (Three Guarantees are: guaranteeing the implementation of the Party's instructions and decisions, guaranteeing the completion of production tasks, and guaranteeing safe production; Four Leading Roles are: taking the lead in doing political and ideological work, taking the lead in tackling key problems, taking the lead in learning advanced experiences, and taking the lead in vigorously carrying out technical revolution), setting an example in everything and taking the lead in charging forward, which greatly encouraged the masses. In order to institutionalize the work of contacting the masses, they also mobilized each Party member to adopt the method of contracting for the masses around them, comprehensively caring for and helping the masses from ideology to production, life, and study. According to the work posts and living and daily life, Party members of the third shift Party group of the shaped steel section of the Large Rolling Mill were assigned responsibilities, each making three intimate friends, frequently explaining the situation to the masses, publicizing the Party's policies, using before and after shifts, before and after meals, individual heart-to-heart talks to help the masses solve ideological problems, and soliciting the opinions of the masses, and taking the unity and leadership of the masses as an important condition for Party member competition and evaluation. The No. 1 Blast Furnace branch of the Ironmaking Plant implemented the method of "Four Contracting," that is, Party group contracts the production team, Party member contracts the masses, veteran worker contracts the new worker, and League member contracts the young worker, which has formed a lively situation of mutual concern, mutual assistance, mutual learning, and common improvement, and political life and technical learning are very active.
    Many branches and groups also regard caring for the lives of the masses and helping the masses solve life difficulties as an important part of political and ideological work. The smelting section branch of the No. 1 Open Hearth Plant proposed that Party members should achieve "Four Arrivals" (to the dormitory, to the canteen and tea garden, to the classroom, to the hospital) "Four Concerns" (concern for the masses' grain consumption, concern for the masses' rest, concern for the masses' illnesses, concern for the masses' family harmony). The No. 1 Blast Furnace branch of the Ironmaking Plant established a "Five Downs" system for political and ideological work among cadres and Party members (down to the production front line, down to the classroom, down to the dormitory, down to the canteen, down to the hospital), deepening political and ideological work into every corner, and strengthening the connection with the masses from all aspects.
    Comprehensively Strengthen Party Leadership and Comprehensively Strengthen Political and Ideological Work from Vertical and Horizontal Aspects
    The continuity and connection of steelmaking production not only requires strengthening horizontal leadership and doing a good job in the close connection between various sections, but also requires doing a good job in the close cooperation between the early, middle, and late shifts and strengthening vertical leadership. In order to adapt to this characteristic, the Party Committee of the No. 1 Converter Plant established Party branches according to vertical sections and promoted the "two-level, three-set, three-shift" work method, that is, the plant level and the section level are equipped with three sets of cadres, divided into three shifts in turn, which not only strengthened the vertical leadership between shifts, but also strengthened the horizontal leadership between various types of work in each shift, so that political and ideological work could be carried out uninterruptedly in every link. The No. 1 Open Hearth Plant also changed the original organizational form of the rotating shift branch, established branches according to sections, and equipped them with three sets of cadres, so that every major shift had a branch secretary and section chief working on the shift, strengthening the leadership of political and ideological and production work. In addition, the Party Committee assigned Party Committee members and deputy plant directors to rotate on duty to provide unified leadership and command to various sections, thus forming a situation of strengthening Party leadership vertically and horizontally, strengthening political and ideological work vertically and horizontally, and strengthening management work vertically and horizontally, effectively promoting the growth of production.
    The Great Leap Forward in Branch Work Guarantees the Great Leap Forward in Production and All Work
    The Great Leap Forward in branch work has promoted the Great Leap Forward in thinking, and the Great Leap Forward in thinking has promoted the Great Leap Forward in production. It is precisely because these units have strengthened the work of Party branches and groups, given full play to the vanguard role of Party members, and mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses, that many things that were previously considered impossible have been done, and difficulties that were previously considered insurmountable have been overcome, and significant achievements have been made in production and all work. For example, the No. 1 Blast Furnace of the Ironmaking Plant, due to the strengthening of Party branch work, has been the company's safety and high-yield red flag for several years, overfulfilling the state plan every year, and production has been rising linearly. In 1958, it completed 114% of the state plan, in 1959, it overfulfilled the plan thirty-two days ahead of schedule, and this year, after completing the state plan eighty-two days ahead of schedule, it again overfulfilled the monthly plan five days ahead of schedule in October, and was included in the company's list of fifteen red flags. Since the No. 1 Converter Plant strengthened the work of Party branches in October, production has risen rapidly and substantially and continuously. Calculated by the average daily production level of steel output, October increased by 28.35% compared with September, mid-October increased by 27.94% compared with early October, late October increased by 17.65% compared with mid-October; and early November increased by 1.83% compared with late October. Many advanced Party groups, due to the deep and thorough political and ideological work and the extensive mobilization of the masses, have achieved a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in more, faster, better, and more economical ways. The second major shift of the coking section of the coking plant, under the strong leadership of the Party group, achieved a "quality, quantity, saving, safety" four-fold leap forward, and was named "High-Yield, High-Quality, Saving, Safe Red Flag Class" by the company. Under the leadership of the Party group, the lime kiln section of the No. 1 Open Hearth Plant not only achieved "halving the personnel and tripling the output," ensuring the needs of open hearth steelmaking, but also achieved good saving and good cooperation and support, and always took out about ten people every day to support the production of other sections.
    The emergence of these advanced branches and groups has set an example for other branches and groups, and is a great encouragement to all Party members and workers. Now, the various branches and groups of Chongqing Iron and Steel are combining their specific circumstances and humbly learning from these advanced experiences, determined to catch up with these advanced branches and advanced groups, and be like the advanced branches and advanced groups, greatly improving the level of branch work, resolutely ensuring the completion of this year's production plan, and laying the foundation for a sustained leap forward next year.

    加强党的领导人人动手做政治思想工作
    重钢总结推广党的基层工作经验
    本报讯　重庆钢铁公司在大搞群众运动中，切实加强党的工作，充分发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用和党小组的核心作用，保证了生产的持续上升。为了更好地发挥基层党组织的作用，最近重钢党委召开了先进支部的支部书记和党小组长会议，对基层党组织的工作经验进行了分析和总结。在此基础上，又召开了支部工作会议，介绍了这些先进经验，在全公司各个支部和党小组中大张旗鼓地掀起了学习和推广这些先进经验的热潮，以进一步提高整个支部工作的水平，为保证完成今年的生产计划和作好明年的生产准备打下坚实的基础。
      在全部生产过程中贯串政治思想工作
    先进支部和小组的一条重要经验是大力加强党的政治思想工作，特别是根据炼钢生产的特点和争分抢秒的要求，不仅加强了班前班后的政治思想工作，特别注意加强了班中的政治思想工作，把政治思想工作贯穿到每一炉钢、每一道生产工序的过程中去，大大发挥了党的政治思想工作的战斗威力。如转炉一厂党委针对转炉生产连续性强、周期性短，生产十分紧张的特点，提出了“一炉钢是一个战斗，一个班是一个战役”的口号，对每炼一炉钢，每出一包铁水，每浇一板模子，都是一开头就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧，针对生产中出现的问题和职工的思想情况，随时召开炉边党小组会，先在党内统一思想，然后分别发动群众，使政治思想工作搞得生动活泼，充满了战斗性（问题抓得准确，解决及时）、预见性（把思想工作作到问题发生之前）和群众性（干部、党员和全体职工，人人作思想工作，处处作思想工作）。平炉一厂冶炼工段支部根据平炉生产的特点，也提出了“一炉钢是一个战役，一个工序是一个战斗”的口号。他们在一炉钢生产过程中除了固定开好三次党小组会以外，党小组还经常在容易引起群众思想波动的环节上了解群众思想动态，进行深入细致的思想工作。如硫高的时候，一般容易产生畏难情绪，他们就及时召开炉边会，提出：“硫磺越多、干劲越大，魔高一尺、道高一丈”，在困难条件下也要夺取胜利；在硫低的时候，一般又容易麻痹松劲，他们就教育群众“死老虎当活老虎打”，充分利用有利条件，夺取更大胜利。这样，就使每个职工群众，在任何情况下都能够斗志昂扬地进行紧张的生产。
    充分发挥党员的先进战士作用争作群众的知心朋友
    先进支部和小组的另一条经验是充分发挥每个党员的先进战士的作用，采取群众路线的方法，人人作政治思想工作。为了更好地发挥党员的模范带头作用，他们加强了对党员的教育，严格党的组织生活，教育每个党员都要处处以身作则，并且密切联系群众，带领广大群众一道前进。炼铁厂一号高炉党支部的党员创造了“三保证、四带头”的经验（三保证是：保证党的指示、决定的贯彻，保证生产任务的完成和保证安全生产；四带头是：带头作政治思想工作，带头攻打关键、带头学习先进经验和带头大闹技术革命），处处以身作则，带头冲锋陷阵，对群众的鼓舞很大。为了把联系群众的工作制度化，还发动每个党员对周围的群众采取包干的办法，从思想到生产、生活、学习，全面地关心和帮助群众。大轧厂型钢工段三班党小组根据工作岗位和居住、日常生活等情况，党员分工负责，每人交三名知心朋友，经常向群众讲解形势，宣传党的方针政策，利用班前、班后、饭前、饭后，个别谈心，帮助群众解决思想问题，和征求群众的意见，并把团结和带领群众作为党员竞赛评比的重要条件。炼铁厂一号高炉支部实行“四包”的办法，即党小组包生产小组、党员包群众、老工人包新工人、团员包青年工人，更形成了互相关心，互相帮助，互相学习，共同提高的生动局面，政治生活和技术学习都很活跃。
    很多支部和小组还把关心群众的生活，帮助群众解决生活困难作为政治思想工作的一项重要内容。平炉一厂冶炼工段支部提出了党员要做到“四到”（到宿舍、到食堂和茶园、到课堂、到医院）“四关心”（关心群众用粮、关心群众休息、关心群众疾病、关心群众家庭和睦）。炼铁厂一号高炉支部在干部和党员中建立了政治思想工作的“五下”制度（下生产第一线、下课堂、下宿舍、下食堂、下医院），把政治思想工作深入到了各个角落，从各方面加强了对于群众的联系。
    从纵的方面和横的方面全面加强党的领导，全面加强政治思想工作
    炼钢生产的连续性、联系性不仅要求加强横的领导，搞好各个工段之间的紧密衔接，还要求搞好早、中、晚三个班之间的紧密配合协作、加强纵的领导。为了适应这一特点，转炉一厂党委按纵的工段成立了党的支部，同时又推行了“两级、三套、三班制”的工作方法，即厂一级和工段一级都配备三套干部，分成三班轮流值班，这样既加强了上下班之间的纵的领导，又在各班之中加强了各个工种之间的横的领导，使政治思想工作在各个环节都能不间断地进行。平炉一厂也改变了原来轮班支部的组织形式，按工段建立了支部，配备了三套干部，使每一个大班都有支部书记和工段长跟班劳动，加强了政治思想和生产工作的领导。加上党委在轮班配备了党委委员和副厂长轮流值班，对各工段进行统一的领导和指挥，这样就形成了纵横加强党的领导，纵横加强政治思想工作，纵横加强管理工作，有力地促进了生产的增长。
    支部工作的大跃进保证了生产和各项工作的大跃进
    支部工作的大跃进，促进了思想大跃进，思想大跃进又促进了生产大跃进。正是由于这些单位加强了党的支部和小组工作，充分发挥了党员的先锋战士作用，调动了广大群众的积极性，很多过去认为办不到的事情办到了，过去认为不可战胜的困难战胜了，生产和各项工作都作出了显著的成绩。如炼铁厂一号高炉由于加强了党的支部工作，几年来一直是公司的安全高产红旗，年年超额完成国家计划，生产直线上升。1958年完成国家计划的114％，1959年提前三十二天超额完成计划，今年提前八十二天完成国家计划后，10月份又再次提前五天超额完成了月计划，列入了公司十五面红旗的行列。转炉一厂自10月份加强党的支部工作以来，生产迅速大幅度持续上升，以钢产量的平均日产水平计算，10月份比9月份提高28.35％，10月中旬比上旬提高27.94％，下旬比中旬提高17.65％；11月上旬又比10月下旬提高1.83％。许多先进的党小组由于政治思想工作作得深透，广泛发动了群众，更实现了多快好省地全面大跃进。焦化厂炼焦工段二大班在党小组的坚强领导下，实现了“质量、产量、节约、安全”四跃进，被公司命名为“高产、优质、节约、安全红旗班”。平炉一厂石灰窑工段在党小组的领导下，不仅实现了“人员减一半，产量增三倍”，保证了平炉炼钢的需要，还作到了节约好、协作支援好，每天总要抽出十人左右支援其他工段的生产。
    这些先进支部和小组的出现，为其他支部和小组树立了榜样，对全体党员和职工群众都是巨大的鼓舞。现在，重钢各个支部和党的小组正在结合本身的具体情况，虚心学习这些先进经验，决心赶上这些先进支部和先进小组，和先进支部、先进小组一个样，把支部工作水平大大提高一步，坚决保证完成今年的生产计划，并打下明年持续跃进的基础。
