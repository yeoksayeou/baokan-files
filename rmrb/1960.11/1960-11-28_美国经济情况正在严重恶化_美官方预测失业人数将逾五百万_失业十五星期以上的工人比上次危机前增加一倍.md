Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The November 20th issue of the American *Worker's Weekly* published an article by George Morris pointing out that the US government estimates that the number of unemployed nationwide will reach five million after Christmas, and will reach five million three hundred thousand by February next year.

The article said that the Labor Department's report showed that the number of unemployed in October increased by nearly 200,000, reaching 3,579,000, although the number of unemployed in this month should have a seasonal decline of 200,000.

The report also revealed that the Labor Department predicts that if the current trend continues, the unemployment figures will reach:

	November: 4.1 million, December: 4.2 million, January: 5.2 million, February: 5.3 million.

The article pointed out, "Even more ominous than the rise in unemployment is what the report reveals": the number of workers unemployed for more than fifteen weeks has surged to 999,000. This is almost double the number of workers unemployed for more than fifteen weeks in October 1957, when the last crisis was about to begin.

The article said, "More bad news has come from other fronts of the economic front. United States Steel Corporation and the other eight major steel companies will reduce the supplementary unemployment benefits to workers by 25% by Christmas. By February next year, seventeen of the eighteen steel companies employing almost all steelworkers will reduce benefits." The article quoted Tomac, head of the insurance section of the United Steelworkers of America, as saying, "The situation in the steel industry is becoming as bad as the worst months of the 1958 recession (referring to the crisis)."

Steelworkers Union President McDonald recently emphasized that 150,000 people are unemployed in the steel industry, and the number of people working only part-time is twice that number.

Steel industry spokesmen also predicted that in the remaining days of November, the operating rate will fall to even below 50%. There will be no increase after November. New steel orders only require a 40% operating rate.

The automotive industry and other steel-consuming industries have reported declines. It is said that the automotive industry is already laying off workers, even though the season for manufacturing 1961 models has just begun.

The article said that Chrysler intends to close three of its seven car assembly plants and its truck plant in Detroit. The Plymouth plant is now working four days a week. Ford is also laying off workers, with hundreds laid off from the engine plant in Cleveland and 560 from the Rocky River stamping plant.

The aluminum industry has also felt the impact. Alcoa Aluminum International has closed a plant in Alcoa, Tennessee. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation has closed more of its plants in Louisiana.

    美国经济情况正在严重恶化
    美官方预测失业人数将逾五百万
    失业十五星期以上的工人比上次危机前增加一倍
    新华社26日讯　11月20日的美国《工人周报》刊载了乔治·摩里斯的一篇文章指出，美国政府估计全国失业人数在圣诞节以后将达到五百万，到明年2月份将达到五百三十万人。
    文章说，劳工部的报告表明，10月份的失业人数增加了将近二十万人，达到了三百五十七万九千人，虽然这个月份的失业人数本应有二十万的季节性下降。
    报告还透露，劳工部预测，如果目前趋势继续下去，失业人口数字将达到：
    11月：四百一十万，12月：四百二十万，1月：五百二十万，2月：五百三十万。
    文章指出，“比失业人数上升甚至更为不祥的是报告中所透露的这一点”：失业十五星期以上的工人已经猛增到了九十九万九千人。几乎比上次危机快要开始时的1957年10月失业十五周以上的工人人数增加一倍。
    文章说，“从经济阵线的其他方面传来了更多不好的消息。美国钢铁公司和其他八大钢铁公司到圣诞节时将把给工人的补充失业补助金减少25％。到明年2月，雇用着几乎全部钢铁工人的十八家钢铁公司中将有十七家减少补助金。”文章引用美国联合钢铁工人工会保险科科长托马科的话说，“钢铁工业情况正在变得像1958年衰退（指危机）中最糟糕的月份那样糟糕。”
    钢铁工人工会主席麦克唐纳最近着重指出，在钢铁工业中有十五万人失业，只有部分时间有工作的人数为此数的两倍。
    钢铁工业发言人也预言在11月的其余日子里，开工率将下降到甚至低于50％。11月以后也不会上升。新的钢铁定货只需要40％的开工率。
    汽车工业和其他以钢为原料的工业纷纷报告下降情况。据说汽车工业中已经在解雇工人，虽然制造1961年式汽车的季节还刚刚开始。
    文章说，克莱勒汽车公司打算把它的七个汽车装配工厂中的三个以及它在底特律的卡车工厂关掉。现在普利茅斯工厂一周工作四天。福特汽车公司也在解雇工人，克利夫兰的引擎工厂已解雇几百人，罗基河的捣压工厂已解雇了五百六十人。
    铝工业也感到了影响。阿尔考铝业国际公司已关闭了它在田纳西州阿尔考的一个工厂。凯塞铝与化学公司已经关闭了它在路易斯安那的更多的工厂。
