According to the 18th issue of "Zhongzhou Review," some philosophy workers in Henan Province held discussions on the issue of the driving force of things' development from the end of August to the beginning of September. Summarized, there are the following two opinions:

One opinion is that not only the struggle of contradictions is the driving force of things' development, but also the unity of contradictions is the driving force. Their reasons are: (1) Contradiction is the driving force of things' development, and the unity and struggle of contradictions are two attributes of contradiction. Therefore, the struggle of contradiction can promote the development of things, and the unity of contradiction can also promote the development of things. For example, the unity of the whole party and the unity of the people of the whole country are the guarantee of our victory. For another example, our emphasis on the combination of politics and profession, the combination of work and rest, and the combination of red and expert are all about the promoting effect of the unity of contradictions on the development of things. (2) The process of the development of things is a cycle of fitting - unfitting - re-fitting - re-unfitting, and in this process, the fastest development is in the fitting stage, which is the effect of the unity of contradictions. For example, when the relations of production are suitable for the nature of the productive forces, they can quickly promote the development of production. (3) The struggle and unity of contradictions are a unity of opposites, and their positions are mutually transformed. Sometimes the struggle of contradictions plays a decisive role in the development of things, and sometimes the unity of contradictions plays a decisive role. (4) It is believed that the relationship between the unity and struggle of contradictions is like the relationship between social existence and social consciousness, and the relationship between form and content. Social existence determines social consciousness, but social consciousness has a reaction on social existence; content determines form, and form also has a reaction on content. The struggle of contradiction has an effect on unity, and unity also has a reaction on struggle.

Most people disagree with the above point of view, believing that the driving force of things' development is not the unity of the two sides of the contradiction, but the struggle of the two sides of the contradiction. Their main arguments are:

(1) The development of things is a process of continuous struggle between the new and the old aspects, and the content of development is the unity of opposites. When we say that development is the unity of opposites, we are talking about a unity full of struggle; when we say that development is the struggle of opposites, it is also the struggle in unity. However, the question of the driving force of things' development and the content of the law of unity of opposites are two questions that are both related and different, and should not be confused. (2) The driving force of things' development is the struggle between the two sides of the contradiction. The development of all things can only rely on struggle, not on reconciliation. Any victory of new things over old things is the result of the struggle of contradictions, not the result of the unity of contradictions. Of course, affirming that the struggle of contradictions is the driving force of things' development does not mean abandoning the unity of contradictions and emphasizing struggle in isolation, because struggle is inherent in unity, and the struggle we are talking about is precisely the struggle in unity. Struggle destroys the old unity and establishes a new unity. The alternation of the new and old of unity, and the mutual transformation of the leading and non-leading aspects of the contradiction are all the results of the struggle of contradictions. The suitability of the relations of production to the productive forces is only relative; there is unsuitability in suitability, and the formation and development of suitability are the results of the struggle of contradictions. Therefore, the driving force of things' development can only be the struggle of the contradictory sides.

    河南哲学工作者讨论事物发展的动力问题
    据《中州评论》第十八期报道：河南省的一些哲学工作者于8月底到9月初，对事物发展的动力问题展开了讨论。综合起来，有如下两种意见。
    一种意见是，不但矛盾斗争是事物发展的动力，矛盾的统一性也是事物发展的动力。他们的理由是：（1）矛盾是事物发展的动力，矛盾统一性与斗争性是矛盾的两种属性，因而矛盾的斗争能够推动事物的发展，矛盾的统一也能够推动事物的发展。比如全党的团结、全国人民的团结就是我们胜利的保证。又如我们强调政治与业务结合、劳逸结合、红专结合等，都是讲的矛盾统一性对事物发展起的促进作用。（2）事物发展的过程是适合—不适合—再适合—再不适合的循环往复的发展过程，在这个过程中，发展最快的是适合阶段，也就是矛盾统一性的作用。例如生产关系适合生产力性质时，就能很快地促进生产的发展。（3）矛盾斗争性与矛盾统一性是对立的统一，它们的地位是互相转化的，有时候矛盾的斗争对事物发展起决定作用，有时候矛盾的统一对事物发展起决定作用。（4）认为矛盾的统一性和斗争性的关系像社会存在和社会意识、形式和内容的关系一样，社会存在决定社会意识，但社会意识对社会存在有反作用；内容决定形式，而形式对内容也有反作用。矛盾的斗争性对统一性有作用，统一性对斗争性也有反作用。
    多数人不同意上述论点，认为事物发展的动力不是矛盾双方的统一性，而是矛盾双方的斗争性。其主要论点是：
  （1）事物的发展是新旧两方面不断斗争的过程，发展的内容则是对立的统一。当说发展是对立统一的时候，说的是充满斗争的统一；当说发展是对立面的斗争的时候，也是统一性中的斗争性。但是，事物发展的动力问题，与对立统一规律的内容是既有联系又有区别的两个问题，不能混为一谈。（2）事物发展的动力是矛盾双方的斗争。一切事物的发展都只能依靠斗争，不能依靠调和。任何新事物战胜旧事物都是矛盾斗争的结果，不是矛盾统一的结果。当然肯定矛盾斗争是事物发展的动力，并不等于抛开了矛盾统一性而孤立地强调斗争性，因为斗争性寓于统一性之中，我们讲的斗争性也正是统一性中的斗争性。斗争性破坏旧统一，建立新统一，统一的新、旧交替，矛盾的主导方面与非主导方面的互相转化，都是矛盾斗争的结果。生产关系适合生产力，也只是相对的，适合之中就有不适合，适合的形成与发展都是矛盾斗争的结果。所以，事物发展的动力只能是矛盾着的双方的斗争。
