    Promote the Communist Spirit of Collaboration to Guarantee Increased Production in Key Steel Plants
    Wuhan Factories Prioritize the Production of Equipment Spare Parts for Wuhan Iron and Steel
    Benxi Steel Adds Two Additional Tasks to Support Ansteel with Concentrated Ore Powder
    (Our newspaper reports) More than eighty large, medium, and small factories in Wuhan City, in the spirit of "proactive, positive, and prioritizing," are enthusiastically producing equipment and spare parts for Wuhan Iron and Steel (WISCO), supporting WISCO's production and construction. Since the beginning of this year, they have produced more than 1,800 tons of equipment and spare parts for WISCO.
    The responsible comrades of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China have convened meetings of responsible persons from relevant units many times to arrange tasks for producing equipment and spare parts for WISCO, focusing on planning, measures, and resolving various specific issues. Relevant departments and factories all regard supporting WISCO as a top priority. Although the production tasks of the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant are very heavy, whenever they receive tasks to support WISCO, they immediately adjust their production plans, allocating equipment and manpower to specialize in the production of spare parts for WISCO. The workers who are specifically responsible for production launched enthusiastic labor competitions, quickly producing large gears and central injection pipes, etc., for WISCO's use. After accepting the task of producing blast furnace iron runners for WISCO, the Wuhan Foundry immediately convened Party committee meetings, workshop meetings, and team meetings, in the spirit of prioritizing arrangement and production, designating the First Workshop to specifically produce equipment for WISCO. They also comprehensively promoted advanced experiences such as mud molding, greatly improving work efficiency and product qualification rates. This batch of tasks was completed eight days ahead of schedule.
    In supporting WISCO, dozens of medium and small factories also actively tried to overcome the difficulties of poor production conditions to produce large-scale equipment for WISCO. Wuchang Machine Factory and Changhong Machine Factory undertook the casting task of WISCO's blast furnace iron runners. Each of these iron runners weighed two to three tons, which they had never done before, and many conditions were not suitable. Initially, they could only make one piece a day, and the work efficiency was very low. With the help of the leading comrades of the Wuchang District Mechanical and Electrical Bureau, they improved the coordination and collaboration between various processes, implemented cross-operation, and also tried to solve the problem of lifting and transporting large pieces, which enabled the casting efficiency to rapidly increase by more than two and a half times, completing the task with quality, quantity, and on time. A group of district-owned small factories also organized themselves, producing various parts of a single product according to the drawings sent by WISCO, and then assembling them to complete the task together.
    (Our newspaper reports) According to the Liaoning Daily: As of November 9, Benxi Iron and Steel Company has supplied Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) with 300,1356 tons of high-quality concentrated ore powder this year, completing the task assigned by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to support Ansteel ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota. At present, Benxi Steel has added a second additional task, preparing to continue allocating 30,000 tons of concentrated ore powder to Ansteel.
    The Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant of Benxi Steel has continuously innovated technology, and the output and quality of concentrated ore powder have increased year by year, ensuring that Benxi Steel has more than enough for its own needs. In February of this year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry decided that Benxi Steel would allocate 200,000 tons of concentrated ore powder to support Ansteel's increased production needs. In order to complete this task, the Benxi Steel Party Committee appointed full-time cadres to be responsible for the allocation work, and the Party Committee also frequently supervised and inspected, completing 100,700 tons by the end of July. After the Liaoning flood in early August, the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant quickly resumed production, while some of Ansteel's ore dressing plants had not yet fully reached pre-disaster levels. After hearing the news, the Benxi Steel Party Committee, in addition to immediately taking out a large amount of its inventory of concentrated ore powder and transporting it to Ansteel, also proactively proposed to allocate an additional 100,000 tons of concentrated ore powder to support Ansteel. After this request was approved by the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Benxi Steel Party Committee decided to use a portion of the inventory of concentrated ore powder on the one hand, and launch a deep-going increase production and conservation campaign among the ore dressing plant workers on the other hand. In the twenty days or so after the flood in August, it supplied Ansteel with more than 100,700 tons of concentrated ore powder.

    发扬共产主义协作精神保证重点钢厂大增产
    武汉各厂尽先为武钢生产设备备件
    本钢两次追加支援鞍钢精矿粉的任务
    本报讯　武汉市八十多个大、中、小工厂，本着“主动积极、尽先办理”的精神，热情地为武钢制作设备和备品备件，支援武钢的生产和建设。今年以来，他们已为武钢制成设备和备品备件一千八百多吨。
    中共武汉市委负责同志曾多次召集有关单位负责人开会，安排为武钢生产设备和备品备件的任务，抓计划，抓措施，并解决各项具体问题。各有关部门和工厂都把支援武钢当作头等重要的任务。武汉重型机床厂的生产任务虽然十分繁重，但每逢接到支援武钢的任务，他们都马上调整生产作业计划，抽出设备、人力专门为武钢制作备件。具体担负生产任务的工人展开热烈的劳动竞赛，迅速制成大型齿轮和中注管等，交武钢使用。武汉铸造厂在接受了制作武钢高炉铁水槽的任务以后，马上召开党委会、车间会、班组会，按照优先安排，优先生产的精神，指定第一车间专门为武钢生产设备。他们还全面推广了泥型铸造等先进经验，大大提高了工效和产品合格率。这批任务比原计划提前八天完成。
    在支援武钢中，数十个中、小工厂也积极设法克服生产条件差的困难，为武钢制作大型设备。武昌机器厂和长虹机器厂承担了武钢高炉铁水槽的铸造任务。这些铁水槽每件都有二、三吨重，他们从来没有做过，许多条件不能适应，最初一天只能做一件，工效很低。在武昌区机电局领导同志的帮助下，他们改进了各个工序之间的配合协作，实行交叉作业，同时设法解决了大件的吊运问题，使铸造工效迅速提高二倍半以上，按质、按量、按期完成了任务。有一批区属小厂还组织起来，按照武钢送来的图纸，分别生产一个品种的各个部件，然后进行总装，共同完成任务。
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：到11月9日止，本溪钢铁公司今年已向鞍钢供应了三十万零一千三百五十六吨优质精矿粉，提前超额完成了冶金工业部规定的支援鞍钢的任务。目前，本钢又第二次追加任务，准备继续拨给鞍钢三万吨精矿粉。
    本钢南芬选矿厂由于不断革新技术，精矿粉产量、质量逐年提高。保证了本钢自给有余。今年2月份，冶金部决定由本钢调拨二十万吨精矿粉支援鞍钢增产需要。本钢党委为了完成这一任务，指派专职干部负责调拨工作，党委也经常督促检查，到7月末就完成了十万零七千吨。8月初辽宁水灾过后，南芬选矿厂迅速恢复了生产，而当时鞍钢部分选矿厂还没有完全达到灾前水平。本钢党委闻讯后，除立即拿出大量库存的精矿粉运往鞍钢外，还主动提出要多调拨十万吨精矿粉支援鞍钢。这个请求得到中共辽宁省委和冶金部同意后，本钢党委便决定一方面动用一部分库存精矿粉，一方面发动选矿厂职工深入开展增产节约竞赛。8月水灾后的二十多天，就供应了鞍钢十万零七千多吨精矿粉。
