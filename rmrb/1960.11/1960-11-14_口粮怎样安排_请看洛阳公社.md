Distribute policies, verify production, and allocate food rations to canteens in one go until the summer harvest of next year; each canteen mobilizes the masses to calculate monthly grain consumption plans based on the busy or slack season of farm work, with quotas assigned to individuals and notified to households, and savings kept by themselves; everyone calculates carefully, every household plans grain consumption, and a trend of thriftiness is greatly promoted.

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch from the 13th) The Luoyang Commune in Suixian County, Hubei Province, mobilized the masses to ascertain grain income, verify production, and take inventory of the warehouse. After arranging for the purchase of grain, they allocated food rations in one go until the wheat harvest next year, and the production team allocated food rations to the canteen in one go, which vigorously promoted production.

The basis for the planned arrangement of commune members' food rations lies in verifying production and ascertaining the existing grain; and the key to ascertaining the existing grain lies in implementing policies, mobilizing the masses, and taking inventory of the warehouse. When the distribution began, each production team first handed over the policies to the masses, told the commune members the purpose of ascertaining the existing grain and planning life in a planned way, announced the total output and yield per unit area of each team to the commune members, and handed over the bottom line to the masses, so that the inventory and verification of output became a conscious action of the masses. After the Yintan Third Team announced the output reported by each team, Feng Guanghua, a member of the Seventh Team, said after hearing this: The grain of our team is no worse than that of other teams, why is the output so low? He mobilized the commune members to help the team leader check and weigh. As a result of the inventory, there were 10,315 jin more of grain, so that the compensation of 2,964 yuan became a reward of 39 yuan. In the process of inventorying the warehouse, each production team not only checked the output, but also implemented the policies, and resolutely returned the grain that should belong to the team and the commune members to the team and the commune members. Through the implementation of the policy, the enthusiasm of the team and the commune members was further brought into play, and the existing grain was quickly weighed and stored separately for purchase grain, seeds, rations, and feed.

On this basis, each production team allocated food rations to the next wheat harvest in one go. For grain-deficient teams, the state allocated the supply quota in one go, and supplied it whenever there was a shortage of grain. Then, the production team allocated the food rations to the canteen in one go. Many production teams also signed agreements on arranging life with the canteen: how many people are in each canteen, how many rations are allocated each month, and when they are issued are all stipulated. At that time, the production team issued a three-part allocation form, and the canteen went to the processing plant to exchange for grain. After the Guanzhuang First Team and Seventh Team allocated food rations to the canteen, they also organized representatives of commune members to inspect and accept the goods, and reported to the commune members: how many food ration warehouses are in the whole team, how much grain is in each warehouse, how much is in the field, and a total of how many food rations, and how much will each person have on average per month by the next wheat harvest. After each canteen allocated the rations in one go, they mobilized the commune members to discuss: how much to eat in the slack season, and how much to eat in the busy season. After the discussion and determination, the amount was calculated on a monthly basis, and the amount was fixed according to the person, and the household was notified, and the savings were kept by themselves. Some canteens, such as the canteens of the Oriental Seventh Team, after making a good amount of food according to the person, the canteen issued each household a grain consumption manual, indicating the amount of food for each person and each household every day and the amount of food for each month. Commune members arrange their own lives according to the manual. After this arrangement, the grain saved by the commune members will be cashed by the canteen every ten days.

After each production team allocated and implemented the food rations in one go, the responsibility of managing life fell on the shoulders of the team, the canteen, and the vast number of commune members. In the past, the canteen accountant of the Third Team Canteen of the Red Star Fifth Team did not manage the grain consumption, and there was no plan for eating grain. After implementation, canteen accountant Ren Deyong said: If we don't have a plan like that again, the commune members will not agree. The team leader also often asked about the canteen, strengthening the leadership of the canteen accountant. Everyone has a plan for eating grain, every household has an arrangement, and a trend of careful calculation and saving grain is greatly promoted. Recently, on the first, eleventh, and twenty-first of each month, many commune members go to the canteen to exchange for their saved grain, or exchange the saved grain for money.

Because the commune carefully arranged the lives of the masses and further implemented the policies, it brought into play the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members and vigorously promoted winter production. Now, the autumn sowing of the entire commune has basically ended, and field management centered on accumulating fertilizer has begun, and thirty small ponds and weirs have been repaired in conjunction with digging ponds.

    口粮怎样安排　请看洛阳公社
    贯彻政策，核实产量，一次把明年夏收以前的口粮落实到食堂；各食堂发动群众，根据农活忙闲，分月算出用粮计划，指标到人，通知到户，节约归己；人人精打细算，户户计划用粮，节约之风大兴。
    本报武汉13日电　湖北随县洛阳公社发动群众查明粮食收入，核实产量，清仓盘点以后，在安排征购粮食的同时，一次把口粮安排到明年麦收；生产队一次把口粮安排到食堂，有力地促进了生产。
    有计划地安排社员口粮的基础，在于核实产量，查清现有粮食；而清查现有粮食的关键，又在于贯彻政策，发动群众，清仓盘点。这个公社各生产队在分配开始时，首先把政策交给群众，把查清现有粮食、有计划安排生活的目的告诉社员，把各小队的总产、单产向社员宣布，把底交给群众，使清仓核实产量变成群众自觉的行动。溳潭三队宣布各小队报的产量以后，七小队的社员冯光华听了以后说：我们小队的谷长的也不比别队差，为啥只那么点产量？他发动社员帮助小队长清查过秤。清仓盘点的结果，多了一万零三百一十五斤粮食，这样就由赔产二千九百六十四元，变成了受奖三十九元。各生产队在清仓盘点中，一边清查产量，一边贯彻政策，应归小队和社员的粮食，坚决归小队和社员所有。通过政策兑现，又进一步发挥了小队和社员的积极性，很快就把现存粮食过了秤，分别把征购粮、种籽、口粮、饲料专仓保管起来。
    各生产队在这个基础上，一次把口粮安排到明年麦收。缺粮队，国家一次把供应指标拨足，什么时候缺粮，什么时候供应。然后，生产队一次把口粮安排到食堂。有很多生产队还和食堂签订了安排生活的协议：哪个食堂好多人，每月好多口粮，什么时候发，都规定好。到时生产队发给三联调拨单，由食堂到加工厂去兑粮。贯庄一队、七队，在口粮落实到食堂以后，还组织了社员代表去检查验收，回去向社员交代：全队一共几个口粮仓库，哪个仓里有好多粮，场里、地里还有好多，共计好多口粮，到明年麦收每人每月平均多少。各个食堂在口粮一次落实以后，又发动社员讨论：闲月吃好多，忙月吃好多。讨论确定以后，分月算出，依人定量，通知到户，节约归己。有些食堂，比如东方七队各食堂，作好依人定量以后，食堂发给每户一个用粮手册，写明每个人、每户每天的定量和各月的定量。社员按手册安排自己的生活。这样安排好以后，社员节约的粮食，由食堂每十天兑现一次。
    各生产队一次把口粮安排落实以后，管好生活的担子，落到小队、食堂和广大社员的肩上来了。红星五队第三小队食堂，以往食堂会计不管用粮，吃粮没有计划。落实以后，食堂会计任德永说：再像那样没有计划，社员就不答应了。小队长也经常问食堂的事，加强了对食堂会计的领导。社员吃粮人人有了计划，户户都有安排，大兴精打细算，节约粮食之风。最近，每逢初一、十一、二十一，各食堂都有很多社员到食堂去兑取自己节约的粮食，或将节约的粮食折价领钱。
    这个公社由于认真安排群众生活，进一步贯彻执行了政策，更加发挥了广大社员的积极性，有力地推动了冬季生产。现在全公社秋播已基本结束，以积肥为中心的田间管理已经开始，结合挑塘已修补小型塘堰三十处。
