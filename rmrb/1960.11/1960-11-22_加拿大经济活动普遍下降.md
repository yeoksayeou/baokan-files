Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa dispatch: Canada's economic situation, which is dependent on the United States, is deteriorating as the American economic crisis deepens.

    By the middle of this year, fourteen out of twenty-one business activity indicators in Canada (from residential construction to the stock market) showed a decline.

    The most recent issue of the research bulletin published by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America listed the facts of the decline in various major business activities in Canada, stating that housing construction in August fell 26% compared to the same period last year, while the number of new housing starts in the first eight months of this year fell 32% compared to last year. Other construction also declined in August, with newly signed construction contracts down 29% from August last year.

    While automobile production has declined, inventories have greatly increased.

    The bulletin believes that although the steel industry is still maintaining a relatively high operating rate, the situation in the Canadian steel industry is expected to deteriorate soon due to the decline in the operating rate of the American steel industry.

    加拿大经济活动普遍下降
    据新华社讯　渥太华消息：依附于美国的加拿大的经济情况，在美国经济危机步步加深的情况下正日益恶化。
    到今年年中为止，在加拿大二十一项企业活动指标中，有十四项指标（由住宅建筑到股票市场）都呈现下降。
    美国联合电气、无线电和机器工人工会出版的最近一期研究公报，列举加拿大各项主要企业活动下降的事实说，8月份房屋建筑比去年同期下降26％，而今年头八个月新房屋开工数则比去年下降32％。其他建筑在8月份也下降了，新签订的建筑合同比去年8月下降了29％。
    汽车工业在产量下降的同时，存货却大大增加。
    这一公报认为，炼钢工业虽然还保持比较高的开工率，但是，由于美国钢铁工业开工率下降，预料加拿大的钢铁工业情况也即将恶化。
