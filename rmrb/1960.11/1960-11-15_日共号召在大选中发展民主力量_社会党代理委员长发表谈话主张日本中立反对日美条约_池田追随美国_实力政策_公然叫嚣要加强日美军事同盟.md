Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 14th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal on the 14th, calling on all Japanese workers to strive for the victory of the JCP in the general election and for the development of patriotic and democratic forces.

The appeal stated that the focus of this general election is the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the issue of neutrality. Japanese Prime Minister Ikeda initially attempted to evade this issue by talking glibly about the so-called new economic policies, attempting to deceive the Japanese people; but after this plot failed, he instead provoked the democratic forces, while focusing the spearhead of splitting the democratic forces on the JCP.

The appeal pointed out that a major development of the JCP in this general election is of great significance for crushing the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionary forces, and at the same time, it is an important key to the progress of the democratic forces in Japan.

The appeal emphasized that the unity of the democratic forces in Japan in building a strong fortress in the general election, and conducting a resolute struggle against the two enemies—U.S. imperialism and the lackey of Japanese monopoly capital, the Ikeda government—is of decisive importance for the Japanese people to win victory.

The appeal pointed out that the strength of the JCP has doubled, and more and more advanced workers are supporting the JCP in participating in the election. No one can stop this torrent.

The JCP Central Committee called on workers to strive for the establishment of a democratic coalition government that opposes the "Security Treaty."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 13th: The acting chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Saburo Eda, expressed his opposition to the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and advocated Japan's implementation of a policy of neutrality at a televised debate last night.

This televised debate focused on Japan's neutral foreign policy. This is part of the ongoing intense election campaign in Japan. In addition to the Socialist Party, the leaders of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party participated in this debate.

Eda said: The neutral policy advocated by the Socialist Party is "not to conclude a military alliance with any one side, but to maintain friendly relations with all parties."

Eda said that the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" "actually has hypothetical enemies." He believes that "from the spirit of the United Nations, this is a heresy and will not work." He said that the Japanese Socialist Party has stated, "We hope to abolish the current Security Treaty."

Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda reiterated his position of following the U.S. "position of strength" policy at the meeting. He said something about "striving to maintain the balance of power (between East and West) to avoid war," and that Japan "would disrupt the balance of power in the world if it advocated neutrality." He clamored to "strengthen" the U.S.-Japan military alliance "this system."

Eda refuted Ikeda's excuse for expanding arms and preparing for war. He said: "Balance of power" will lead to competition for arms expansion and war preparation with huge expenses, and will eventually lead to war. He said that the government should consider these consequences, earnestly implement disarmament, and actively pursue a policy of neutrality.

Eda said, "We believe that a collective security guarantee (treaty) should be concluded in Asia by China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, or plus two or three other countries."

The debate held last night did not invite the Japanese Communist Party to participate. In response, Kozo Kameyama, director of the Japanese Communist Party's Election Struggle Headquarters, pointed out at a press conference that excluding the JCP and holding a three-party representative discussion is extremely unfair and unreasonable.

Kameyama emphasized that the JCP has long pointed out that the focus of this general election struggle is the "Security Treaty" issue. The JCP has always maintained that neutrality is the path that the Japanese people who strive for peace and independence should take.

    日共号召在大选中发展民主力量
    社会党代理委员长发表谈话主张日本中立反对日美条约
    池田追随美国“实力政策”公然叫嚣要加强日美军事同盟
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会14日发表呼吁书，号召全体日本工人为争取日共在大选中取得胜利，争取爱国民主力量的发展而奋斗。
    呼吁书说，这次大选的焦点是日美“安全条约”和中立问题。日本首相池田最初企图回避这个问题而侈谈所谓经济新政策，企图欺骗日本人民；但在这种阴谋遭到失败后，竟然对民主力量进行挑衅，同时把分裂民主力量的矛头着重指向日共。
    呼吁书指出，在这次大选中使日共大发展，对于粉碎美日反动势力的阴谋具有重大意义，同时是使日本民主力量取得进展的重要关键。
    呼吁书强调指出，日本民主力量在大选中团结起来筑成强大堡垒，并同两个敌人——美帝国主义和日本垄断资本的仆从池田政府进行坚决的斗争，这对于日本人民争取胜利具有决定性的作用。
    呼吁书指出，日共力量已经增加了一倍，越来越多的先进工人在支援日共参加竞选，任何人都不能阻挡这支巨流。
    日共中央号召工人为争取建立反对“安全条约”的民主联合政府而奋斗。
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本社会党代理委员长江田三郎在昨天晚间举行的电视广播辩论会上，表示反对日美“安全条约”，主张日本实行中立政策。
    这次电视广播辩论会是以日本中立外交政策为主要的辩论题目的。这是目前正在日本激烈进行的竞选活动的一部分。除了社会党外，民主社会党和自由民主党的首脑参加了这次辩论会。
    江田说：社会党主张的中立政策是“不要只同任何一方缔结军事同盟，而同任何一方都保持友好关系”。
    江田说，新日美“安全条约”“实际上是有假想敌国的”。他认为，“从联合国的精神来说，这是一种邪道，是不行的”。他说，日本社会党已经表示，“我们希望废除现行的安全条约”。
    日本首相池田勇人在会上重申他追随美国“实力地位”政策的立场。他说什么“要努力保持（东西方的）力量均衡以避免战争”，日本“如果主张中立就要破坏世界上的力量均衡”。他叫嚣要“加强”日美军事同盟“这个体制”。
    江田驳斥了池田这种扩军备战的借口。他说：“力量均衡”将造成以庞大的经费进行扩军备战的竞争，到最后会导致战争。他说，政府应该考虑这种后果，认真地实行裁军，积极地奉行中立政策。
    江田说，“我们认为应该在亚洲由中、苏、美、日或者再加上两、三个国家来缔结集体安全保障（条约）”。
    昨天晚上举行的辩论会没有邀请日本共产党参加。对此，日本共产党选举斗争本部事务局长龟山幸三曾经在记者招待会上指出，排除日共，举行三党代表讨论会，这样的做法是极为不公正的，是不合理的。
    龟山强调指出，日共早已指明，这次大选斗争的焦点是“安全条约”问题。日共一贯主张中立是争取和平和独立的日本人民应走的道路。
