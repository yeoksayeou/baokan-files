Xinhua News Agency, 7th November: Ambassador Chervonenko of the Soviet Union to China's speech at the reception celebrating the 43rd Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution: Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, dear Comrades, friends, ladies and gentlemen:

For forty-three years, the red flag of socialism, first raised in world history by the Russian proletariat, under the leadership of the Communist Party, which carried out the Great October Socialist Revolution, has been flying victoriously. The October Revolution announced to the world the beginning of a new era: the collapse of dying capitalism and the victory of socialism.

Please allow me to express my heartfelt welcome to all the representatives of the brotherly Chinese people present here, and to all the respected guests, who have graced our embassy today to solemnly celebrate the glorious and joyous festival of the Soviet Union.

Dear Comrades, friends!

Today, while celebrating the Great October Revolution, we note with pleasure that throughout these forty-three years, the Soviet people, both in the past and now, have steadfastly held high the ever-victorious banner of Marxism-Leninism. Our domestic affairs are progressing very well. The Soviet people are closely united around the beloved Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Communist Party headed by Comrade Khrushchev. The Soviet people are loyal to Marxism-Leninism, combining internationalist and national tasks and obligations, and are victoriously realizing the magnificent plan of building communism with intense labor. After the realization of this plan, our country will be able, in the near future, not only in terms of strength or power, but also in terms of per capita production, to become the world's first strong nation. The Soviet people are persistently pursuing a foreign policy of peace, the main content of which is peaceful coexistence and friendship between all nations.

Dear Comrades, friends!

Lenin said that we can be proud and deeply fortunate that we were the first to overthrow the beast of capitalism in one corner of the earth. It stained the earth with blood, and it led mankind to starvation and degradation. No matter how fiercely and brutally it struggles in its dying moments, it will inevitably perish soon.

Now, the unfading banner of the October Revolution has become a symbol of freedom, peace, and happiness. Under its light, more and more millions of people are united under the single, unstoppable desire to strive for the bright future of mankind - communism. Following the Russian people, the people of great China and a series of other countries have also embarked on the road of the October Revolution. They have firmly embarked on the road of building socialism. The victory of the Chinese revolution is an extremely great historical event. It is a new and devastating blow to imperialism.

The battle-tested Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, applied the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism to the specific realities of its own country, successfully led its people onto the road of building socialism, and achieved great victories, building its country into an advanced industrial power with a strong socialist economy, modern science and technology, and a high level of culture.

The formation of the world socialist system, the historical achievements of the socialist camp countries (by 1965, the socialist camp will produce more than half of the world's products) are the decisive factors in the entire life of the present era. Socialism has already achieved a complete and irreversible victory on a global scale.

All of this fundamentally changed the balance of world forces, which is favorable to socialism. Imperialism has forever lost the era of hegemony. The various colonial empires have collapsed, and the ideas of liberation ignited by the October Revolution have spread throughout the world. In the forty-three years since, especially recently, after the Second World War, more than forty countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have broken free from the shackles of hateful colonialism one after another. The activities of the Soviet delegation headed by Khrushchev and the delegations of other socialist countries and peace-loving countries at the 15th UN General Assembly have further strengthened the confidence in the victory of the noble cause of striving for freedom and independence. At the 15th UN General Assembly, a most humane demand of all mankind was grandly announced: the complete and thorough elimination of the shameful colonial system of imperialism.

However, all those who cherish peace and freedom should not forget that as long as imperialism exists, it will bring many disasters to the people. Therefore, it is necessary to relentlessly heighten vigilance and expose the conspiracies of the imperialists and their running dogs. Truth is on the side of the people. As long as the people of all countries unite, they can block the road to war. The decisive force in this regard is the Soviet Union and all the countries of the socialist camp, which consistently and resolutely advocate complete and thorough disarmament. However, the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, are unwilling to implement complete and thorough disarmament, but are intensifying the arms race and establishing military bases that threaten peace. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union will, together with all socialist countries, consolidate its national defense and master all necessary modern means of defense in order to gloriously and solemnly defend the achievements of the Great October Revolution.

The ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the October Revolution have won victories in the unbreakable unity and powerful strength of the socialist camp, in the national liberation movements of all peoples, and in the struggle for world peace.

The People's Republic of China pursues the principle of peaceful coexistence and makes great contributions to the great and noble cause of peace. The Soviet people firmly advocate the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and have always supported, and will forever support, the just actions of the Chinese people against US imperialism, and the firm confidence of the Chinese people in liberating their territory - Taiwan.

The friendship between the two great countries, the Soviet Union and China, has historical significance. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The people of the great China and the great Soviet Union are the closest brothers and the most reliable comrades-in-arms... No force in the world can separate us. The friendship of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union is an eternal and unbreakable friendship." These words express the feelings of the great Chinese people, and the Soviet people feel the same.

The visit of the high-level Chinese party and government delegation headed by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, to Moscow to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the October Revolution will undoubtedly play a huge role in further consolidating and developing the cause of Soviet-Chinese friendship.

Today, on the glorious festival of the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Revolution, the Soviet people wholeheartedly congratulate their brothers - the great Chinese people, and wish them new achievements and brilliant victories on the glorious road of building socialism.

Long live the great banner of the October Revolution, which illuminates the way for all peoples in the struggle for the bright future of mankind and communism!

Dear Comrades and friends!

Please allow me to propose:

For the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution,
For the socialist system, the indestructible fortress of peace and security for all nations,
For the prosperity of the great family of socialist camp countries,
For the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the great Chinese people and the great Soviet people,
For the great Chinese people, for the Communist Party of China and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong,
For the government of the People's Republic of China, for the health of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai,
For the unity of the people of all countries in the struggle against war and colonialism,
For the friendship of the people of all countries, for world peace,
Cheers!

    中苏两国人民是最亲密的兄弟
    契尔沃年科大使在庆祝十月革命节招待会上的讲话
    新华社7日讯　苏联驻中国大使契尔沃年科在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年招待会上的讲话亲爱的毛泽东同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们，女士们和先生们：
    在共产党的领导下实行了伟大的十月社会主义革命的俄罗斯无产阶级在世界历史上首次举起的社会主义红旗已经胜利地飘扬了四十三年。十月革命向全世界宣告了垂死资本主义的崩溃和社会主义的胜利这一新时代的开始。
    请允许我衷心地欢迎在座的兄弟的中国人民的各位代表和所有的尊敬的客人，他们今天光临我们大使馆，前来隆重地庆祝苏联的光辉和欢乐的节日。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    今天，在庆祝伟大的十月革命节的时候，我们怀着愉快的心情指出，在这所有四十三年的过程中苏联人民不论过去和现在都坚定不移地高举起马列主义的百战百胜的旗帜。我们国内的事业进行得非常好。苏联人民紧密地团结在亲爱的共产党和以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的共产党中央委员会周围，苏联人民忠实于马列主义，把国际主义的和本国的任务和义务结合起来并正在以紧张的劳动胜利地实现着建设共产主义的宏伟计划。这个计划实现以后，我们国家将有可能就在最近期间不但在力量或威力方面，而且也在按人口平均计算的生产量方面成为世界上第一个强国。苏联人民坚持不懈地执行着和平的外交政策，这一政策的主要内容就是和平共处和各国人民之间的友谊。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    列宁说过，我们可以自豪，并且深以为幸的，就是我们最先在地球的一角打倒了资本主义这只野兽，它使地球沾满了血污，它把人类引到了饥饿和退化的地步，现在不论它临死时挣扎得怎样凶狠残暴，但是必然会很快地灭亡的。
    现在，十月革命的永不褪色的旗帜成了自由、和平和幸福的象征，在它的照耀下越来越多的千百万人民团结在争取人类光明的未来——共产主义这个统一的不可抑止的愿望之下。随着俄国人民之后，伟大的中国和一系列其他国家的人民也走上了十月革命的道路。它们已经坚定地走上了建设社会主义的道路。中国革命的胜利是极其巨大的历史事件。它是对帝国主义的一次新的毁灭性的打击。
    以毛泽东同志为首的经过战斗考验的中国共产党创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马列主义的普遍真理运用到本国的具体实际中去，顺利地把本国人民引上建设社会主义的道路并且取得了伟大的胜利，把自己的国家建设成为一个具有强大社会主义经济、现代科学和技术和高度文化的先进的工业强国。
    世界社会主义体系的形成，社会主义阵营各国的历史成就（到1965年社会主义阵营将生产世界半数以上的产品）是现时代全部生活中的决定因素。社会主义已经在世界范围内取得了彻底的和不可改变的胜利。
    所有这一切从根本上改变了世界力量的对比，这是有利于社会主义的。帝国主义永远地丧失了称王称霸的时代，各个殖民帝国崩溃了，在全世界都传播着十月革命所燃起的解放思想。四十三年来，特别是最近，第二次世界大战以后，亚、非、拉丁美洲四十多个国家一个接着一个地挣脱了可恨的殖民主义的枷锁。以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联代表团和其他社会主义国家以及爱好和平国家的代表团在十五届联合国大会上的活动更加强了对争取自由和独立这个崇高事业的胜利的信心。在十五届联合国大会上雄伟地宣布了一项全人类最人道的要求：完全和彻底消灭帝国主义的可耻的殖民制度。
    但是，所有珍视和平和自由的人们不应该忘记，只要帝国主义还存在，它就会给人民带来许多灾难。因此，必须不放松地提高警惕，揭露帝国主义者和他们走狗的阴谋。真理在人民这一面。各国人民只要团结起来，就能够堵塞战争的道路。在这方面的决定力量是一贯坚决主张彻底全面裁军的苏联和所有社会主义阵营的国家。但是，以美国为首的帝国主义国家不愿意彻底全面裁军，而是加紧军备竞赛，建立威胁和平的军事基地，在这种情况下，苏联将同所有社会主义国家一道巩固国防和掌握一切必要的现代防御手段，以便光荣地庄严地捍卫伟大十月革命的成果。
    马克思列宁主义和十月革命的思想在社会主义阵营的牢不可破的团结和强大的力量方面，在各族人民的民族解放运动中以及在争取世界和平的斗争中获得了胜利。
    中华人民共和国奉行和平共处的原则，对伟大的崇高的和平事业作出巨大的贡献。苏联人民坚决主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，过去，现在和将来永远支持中国人民反对美帝国主义的正义行为，支持中国人民解放自己的领土——台湾的坚定信心。
    苏中两个伟大国家的友谊具有历史的意义。毛泽东同志说：“伟大的中苏两国人民是最亲密的兄弟和最可靠的战友。……世界上没有任何力量能够把我们分开。中苏八亿人民的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的友谊。”这些话表达了伟大中国人民的感情，苏联人对此具有同感。
    以中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志为首的中国高级党政代表团前往莫斯科庆祝十月革命四十三周年，对进一步巩固和发展苏中友谊的事业，无疑将起巨大的作用。
    今天，在伟大的十月革命四十三周年的光荣节日里，苏联人民衷心地祝贺自己的兄弟——伟大的中国人民并在建设社会主义的光荣的道路上取得新的成就和辉煌的胜利。
    在争取人类光明的未来和共产主义的斗争中为各国人民照亮道路的伟大的十月革命旗帜万岁！
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    请允许我提议：
    为伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年，
    为各国人民的和平和安全的不可摧毁的堡垒——社会主义体系，
    为社会主义阵营各国伟大的大家庭的繁荣，
    为伟大的中国人民同伟大的苏联人民之间的永恒的和不可摧毁的友谊，
    为伟大的中国人民，为中国共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会，
    为中华人民共和国政府，为刘少奇同志，朱德同志，周恩来同志的健康，
    为各国人民在反对战争和殖民主义的斗争中的团结一致，
    为世界各国人民的友谊，为全世界的和平，
    干杯！
