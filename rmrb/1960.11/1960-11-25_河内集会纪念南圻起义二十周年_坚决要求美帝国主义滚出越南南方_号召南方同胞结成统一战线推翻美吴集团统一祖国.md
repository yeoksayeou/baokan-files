Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 24th: Over 7,000 people from all walks of life in Hanoi solemnly held a rally at the People's Theater on the evening of the 23rd to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Nam Kỳ Uprising, a large-scale uprising that broke out in southern Vietnam on November 23, 1940, against the colonial rule of French imperialism and for national independence. Amidst rousing slogans, the assembly unanimously passed a resolution fully supporting the struggle of the South Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialist aggression and to overthrow the dictatorial rule of the U.S. imperialist puppet Ngô Đình Diệm clique, in order to establish a broad-based national democratic coalition government in South Vietnam. The resolution firmly demanded that U.S. imperialism get out of South Vietnam.

　　Tôn Thất Tùng, member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and member the Presidum of the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front, spoke at the meeting. He said that today, with great excitement and strong confidence, we are actively promoting the indomitable spirit of the Nam Kỳ Uprising; warmly welcoming the unyielding and resolute struggle of our southern compatriots to overthrow the U.S.-Ngô rule, liberate South Vietnam, and reunify the country.

　　Tôn Thất Tùng said that for six years, the U.S.-Ngô clique has frantically persecuted and suppressed the South Vietnamese people, and tried its best to eliminate dissidents, but all this still cannot save its declining power.

　　Tôn Thất Tùng pointed out that the more the U.S.-Ngô clique is in a passive position and the more it is weakened, the more frantically it will struggle. The South Vietnamese people must vigorously strengthen the broad national united front, realize the unity of workers, peasants, and soldiers, actively promote the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggressors and war provocateurs, and overthrow the dictatorial rule of the Ngô Đình Diệm clique, which acts as a U.S. imperialist puppet, in order to establish a broad national democratic regime, realize national independence and various democratic freedoms and rights, improve the people's livelihood, and then reunify the country and strive for the glorious victory of the people and the motherland.

　　Tôn Thất Tùng said that now is the time for every person in our southern country to more clearly recognize their responsibility in the cause of national salvation, participate in the struggle in appropriate forms according to the environment, and strive to strengthen and expand the national solidarity front against the U.S.-Ngô clique. He said that no matter who it is, even those who followed the U.S.-Ngô clique yesterday, if they come to the side of the people today, our people will always extend their hands to welcome them. Anyone who wants to oppose Ngô Đình Diệm must oppose U.S. imperialism, must be with the people, rely on the people, and unite and act together with the people, so that they can succeed.

　　Tôn Thất Tùng said that the officers and soldiers of the southern army should now see more clearly than ever that the only way to get rid of the vicious clutches of the U.S.-Ngô clique is to resolutely unite with the people and fight to overthrow the U.S.-Ngô rule.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 23rd: Today is the 20th anniversary of the Nam Kỳ Uprising in Vietnam. Newspapers in Hanoi published editorials, articles, memoirs, and photos of historical relics of the Nam Kỳ Uprising to commemorate this important historical event.

　　On November 23, 1940, the South Vietnamese people launched a large-scale Nam Kỳ Uprising throughout the south to oppose the rule of French imperialism and strive for national independence. The uprising was not successful.

　　The "People's Daily" published an editorial entitled "Actively Promoting the Heroic Solidarity and Struggle Spirit of the Nam Kỳ Uprising," saying that the great contribution of the Nam Kỳ Uprising still plays an active role in Vietnam's entire revolutionary cause today.

　　The editorial emphasized that people of all strata in the south should unite into a broad front, concentrate their efforts to launch a struggle, overthrow the ruling system of the U.S.-Ngô clique, and establish a genuine national and democratic regime.

　　The editorial also said that with the north as a solid backing, the close unity of the patriotic forces of the southern people against the U.S.-Ngô clique will surely be able to overthrow the U.S.-Ngô clique, liberate the South Vietnamese people, and build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam together with the North Vietnamese people.

    河内集会纪念南圻起义二十周年
    坚决要求美帝国主义滚出越南南方
    号召南方同胞结成统一战线推翻美吴集团统一祖国
    新华社河内24日电　河内各界人士七千多人23日晚上在人民剧场隆重举行集会，纪念越南南方人民在1940年11月23日为反对法帝国主义的殖民统治、争取民族独立而在南部爆发的大规模南圻起义二十周年。大会在激昂的口号声中一致通过决议，完全支持越南南方人民反对美帝国主义侵略、打倒美帝国主义走狗吴庭艳独裁统治集团的斗争，以便在越南南方成立一个广泛的民族民主的联合政府。决议坚决要求美帝国主义滚出越南南方。
    越南劳动党中央委员、祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员雍文谦在会上讲话。他说，今天，我们以莫大的兴奋和强烈的信心，积极发扬南圻起义的不屈不挠的斗争精神；热烈欢迎南方同胞为推翻美吴统治、解放越南南方、统一国家而进行的不屈不挠的坚决的斗争。
    雍文谦说，六年来，美吴集团对越南南方人民疯狂地进行迫害、扫荡，极力排除异己，但这一切仍然不能挽回它的走向没落的权势。
    雍文谦指出，目前，美吴集团愈是处于被动地位和愈被削弱，它们就会愈加疯狂挣扎。越南南方人民必须大力加强广泛的民族团结阵线，实现工农兵联合，积极推进反对美帝国主义侵略者和战争挑拨者、推翻充当美帝国主义走狗的吴庭艳集团独裁统治的斗争，以便成立广泛民族民主政权，实现民族独立和各种民主自由权利，改善人民生活，进而统一国家，争取人民和祖国的辉煌胜利。
    雍文谦说，现在已经是我国南方每一个人愈加清楚地认识到自己在救国事业中的责任、根据环境以适当形式参加斗争、极力加强和扩大反美吴集团的全民团结阵线的时候了。他说，不论是谁，即使是昨天还跟随着美吴集团的人，要是今天走向人民方面来，我国人民都将随时伸出手来迎接他们。任何人要反对吴庭艳，就要反对美帝国主义，就要同人民在一起，依靠人民，同人民一起联合行动，这样才能够获得成功。
    雍文谦说，南方军队官兵们，现在比任何时候都应更加清楚地看到，摆脱美吴集团的凶恶魔掌的唯一道路是，坚决同人民联合，为推翻美吴统治而斗争。
    新华社河内23日电　今天是越南南圻起义二十周年，河内各报发表社论、文章、回忆录和南圻起义的历史文物的照片等，纪念这一重要的历史事件。
    1940年11月23日越南南方人民为反对法帝国主义统治和争取民族独立爆发了遍及南方各地的大规模的南圻起义。起义结果没有获得成功。
    “人民报”发表题为“积极发扬南圻起义的英勇团结斗争精神”的社论说，南圻起义的巨大贡献，直到今天仍然对越南的整个革命事业起着积极的作用。
    社论强调指出，南方各阶层人民应团结成为一个广泛的战线，集中力量展开斗争，推翻美吴集团的统治制度，建立真正的民族、民主政权。
    社论还说，以北方作为稳固的后盾，南方人民反美吴集团的爱国力量的紧密团结，一定能够推翻美吴集团，解放越南南方人民，同越南北方人民一起建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主、富强的越南。
