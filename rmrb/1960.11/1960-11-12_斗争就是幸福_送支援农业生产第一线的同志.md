	Struggle is Happiness
	—Sending Comrades to the Forefront of Supporting Agricultural Production
	Ge Song
	These days, whenever I see the words "forefront of agricultural production," I can't help but think of the commune where I once lived and worked, and of the many comrades working in the countryside. Among the many faces, the most unforgettable is the image of a young man at work. He was a sturdy young fellow, swinging a pickaxe, digging a fertilizer pit. He made short, sharp sounds: "Hai!" With each swing, he could dig out a large chunk of earth. Whenever he dug out a large chunk of earth, he would cheerfully joke, "I've chopped off the head of a reactionary!" "Hai, another one!" The more he dug, the more energetic he became. After digging the last piece, he straightened up, one hand on the pickaxe handle, the other raised to wipe the sweat from his brow, looking at the rectangular fertilizer pit he had dug, his dark and healthy face beaming with happiness. It's a pity I'm not a painter, but if I could paint that expression of his, I think I could call the painting "Happiness." Yes, only the word "happiness" can accurately describe his mood and form at that moment. "To struggle with the heavens is endless joy! To struggle with the earth is endless joy! To struggle with people is endless joy!" In their struggle with the heavens, the earth, and people, the laboring people always show this endless joy and heroic spirit towards struggle.
	What is the greatest happiness? Someone asked Marx about his understanding of happiness, and Marx replied, "Struggle." Struggle is the greatest happiness, this is the view of happiness held by Marx and all communists.
	Everything in the world has contradictions, and where there are contradictions, there is struggle. The exploiting classes struggle to gain promotion and fortune, their struggle is to harm others and benefit themselves, and to suppress the resistance of the laboring people. This kind of struggle, in our view, is reactionary, barbaric, and shameful. The revolutionary working class, on the other hand, struggles to create a new world, and to struggle against heaven, against the earth, and against people – the dregs and parasites of humanity. This struggle is just and noble; to engage in such a struggle is the greatest happiness. Is there anything more happiness than this in the world? No, there is not.
	Struggle is happiness. Because happiness is obtained through struggle. Without the arduous revolutionary struggle of the past, there would be no happiness today. Our revolutionary predecessors, when climbing snow-covered mountains and crossing grasslands, thought that their struggle would create happiness for tomorrow and for future generations. Therefore, no matter how arduous and tortuous the struggle was, they never thought it was bitter, but rather regarded it as a happiness to be able to engage in such a noble struggle. Now that we are enjoying the fruits of the happiness of the struggle of the previous generation of revolutionaries, how should we struggle for greater happiness today and in the future!
	However, happiness is not only in the moment of victory in struggle, but even more so in the midst of struggle. Countless revolutionary martyrs, although they did not enjoy the fruits of victory, were so firm in their struggle, even sacrificing their lives; and at the moment of sacrificing their lives, they were so full of revolutionary optimism, and regarded dying for the revolutionary struggle as their glory and happiness. Why were they unable to enjoy the fruits of victory, but were able to regard the arduous struggle and dying for the revolution as happiness? Because they were convinced that their cause was just and that the struggle would surely be victorious; because they had broken away from all petty bourgeois individualism and truly reached a selfless state. Breaking away from petty bourgeois individualism means liberating oneself from the shackles of all selfish desires and becoming a truly free person. In their view, the important thing in engaging in struggle is not whether they can enjoy the fruits of the struggle, but whether their struggle contributes to the advancement and development of human society; in their view, laying a brick or piece of wood in the future magnificent communist edifice is their duty and their glorious right.
	Of course, socialist construction is different from the military struggle period before the people seized power, but establishing a worldview that struggle is happiness still has great significance for us. Only in this way will we not be afraid of struggle because of the arduousness of the new struggle; and we will not be greedy for comfort and stop moving forward because of the victory of the revolution. Our revolutionary predecessors had great revolutionary ambitions and courage, dared to struggle, and were happy to struggle. Their hard work and cultivation finally blossomed into bright flowers and bore abundant fruit. We, the successors of socialism and communism – the younger generation – now also embrace lofty revolutionary aspirations, dare to struggle, and are happy to struggle. Wang Peizhen, a young farmer in Hebei, said: "I live in this collective, and lofty communist ideals inspire me. Although I am covered in sweat and mud after a day of work, I feel that I am the happiest person in the world." Xiao Shulin, a young farmer in Hubei, said: "Mountains change, waters change, and they must be changed by people! The roots of poverty will not rot by themselves, and rich seedlings must be planted by people. If you don't work hard, where will happiness come from?" With advanced figures like Wang Peizhen, Xiao Shulin, Xing Yanzi, and Lü Genze in the countryside who take struggle as happiness and seek happiness from struggle, the magnificent edifice of socialism and communism will surely stand tall in that vast world!

### 斗争就是幸福——送支援农业生产第一线的同志

    斗争就是幸福
    ——送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    这几天，当我一见到农业生产第一线这几个字的时候，我总是禁不住想起我曾经生活过、劳动过的公社，想起许多在农村工作的同志们。在许多人的面影中，最难忘的是一个青年在劳动时的形象。那是个结实的小伙子，挥舞着镐头，正在挖个积肥坑。他口中发出短促的声音：“嗨！”一家伙挖下去，就能挖出一大块土。每逢挖出一大块土时，他就快活地打趣说：“我砍掉一个反动派的脑袋！”“嗨，又是一个！”他越挖劲头越足，挖完最后一块，便直起腰来，一只手扶着镐头柄，另一只手臂举起来抹抹额上的汗水，看着自己挖成了的长方形的积肥坑，黝黑健康的脸上，幸福地笑了。可惜我不是画家，如果能把他那副神态绘成画，这幅画我以为可以名之为“幸福”。是的，只有“幸福”两字，才最能恰切地形容他当时的心境和形态。“与天奋斗，其乐无穷！与地奋斗，其乐无穷！与人奋斗，其乐无穷！”劳动人民在同天、地、人的奋斗中，总是表现出这种对斗争的无穷乐趣和豪迈气概。
    什么是最大的幸福？有人问马克思对幸福的理解，马克思回答说：“斗争。”斗争就是最大的幸福，这是马克思和一切共产主义者的幸福观。
    天下事物都有矛盾，有矛盾就有斗争。剥削阶级为升官发财而斗争，他们的斗争是损人利己、镇压劳动人民反抗。这种斗争，在我们看来，是反动、野蛮、可耻的。革命的工人阶级，则为创造一个新世界，而与天、与地、与人——人类的渣滓和寄生虫进行斗争，这种斗争是正义的高尚的；从事这样的斗争，就是最大的幸福。天下还有什么比这更幸福的吗？没有了。
    斗争就是幸福。因为幸福，是通过斗争得来的。没有过去艰苦的革命斗争，就没有今天的幸福。我们的革命前辈们，在爬雪山、过草地时，想到他们的斗争，会给明天、会给子孙万代缔造幸福，因此尽管斗争多么艰苦曲折，也从不以为苦，反而以能从事那样崇高的斗争为幸福。如今我们享受到了前一代革命者斗争的幸福的果实，该如何为今天和未来的更大幸福而斗争啊！
    然而，幸福也还不仅在于斗争获得胜利的时候，幸福，更在于斗争之中。无数革命先烈，虽然没有享受到胜利的果实，但在斗争中是如此坚定，甚至献出生命；而在献出生命时，又是如此充满革命的乐观精神，并把为革命斗争而死，视为自己的光荣和幸福。为什么他们享受不到胜利的果实，却能把艰苦的斗争和为革命而死引为幸福？因为他们确信，他们的事业是正义的，斗争一定会胜利；因为他们已经摆脱了一切个人主义的低级趣味，真正达到了忘我的境界。摆脱了个人主义的低级趣味，也就是说，从一切私欲的锁链中解放出来，成为一个真正的自由的人。在他们看来，从事斗争，重要的不是自己能否享受到斗争的果实，而是通过自己的斗争，对推动人类社会的前进与发展有没有贡献；在他们看来，在未来的宏伟的共产主义大厦里，砌上一砖一木，是自己的义务，也是自己光荣的权利。
    当然，社会主义建设和人民还没有取得政权以前的军事斗争时期不同，但树立斗争就是幸福这样的世界观，对我们仍然有着巨大的意义。只有这样，我们才会不因新的斗争的艰巨，而害怕斗争；不因革命的胜利，而贪图安逸，停止前进。我们革命的先辈，有着革命的大志大勇，敢于斗争，乐于斗争，他们的辛勤的播种和耕耘，终于开出了鲜艳的花，结出了丰硕的果。我们社会主义、共产主义的接班人——年青的一代如今也怀抱革命的凌云壮志，敢于斗争，乐于斗争。河北的青年农民王培珍说：“我生活在这个集体中，崇高的共产主义理想鼓舞着我。虽然一天劳动之后，全身淌汗，沾满了泥巴，但是我觉得，我是世界上最幸福的人。”湖北的青年农民萧树林说：“山变、水变，都得靠人去变！穷根自己烂不掉，富苗更得靠人栽，不往苦里干，哪有幸福来？”农村里有了王培珍、萧树林、邢燕子、吕根泽等等这样以斗争为幸福、从斗争中求幸福的先进人物，社会主义——共产主义的宏伟大厦，将一定在那广阔的天地里高高矗起！
