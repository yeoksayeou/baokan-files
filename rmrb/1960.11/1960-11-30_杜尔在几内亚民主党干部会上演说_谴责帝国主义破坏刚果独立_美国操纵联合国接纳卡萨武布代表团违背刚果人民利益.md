Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, November 24th: President of Guinea and Secretary-General of the Guinean Democratic Party, Sékou Touré, strongly condemned imperialist aggression and oppression in Africa. He pointed out that neo-colonialism, disguised imperialism, is the primary danger at present.

Sékou Touré made these remarks in his closing address at the Second National Cadre Conference of the Guinean Democratic Party held in Kankan. The four-day conference closed on the 24th. The conference adopted resolutions on political and economic issues.

In his closing address, Sékou Touré condemned the French imperialist colonial war of suppression in Algeria and Cameroon; he stressed that there was no room for a middle ground between the policies of French imperialism and the independence of the Algerian people.

Speaking on the situation in the Congo, Touré condemned the imperialist conspiracy aimed at dividing the Congo and undermining Congolese independence.

Touré said that Guinea has decided to withdraw its representative from the United Nations Conciliation Commission to the Congo because the United States forced the United Nations to pass its proposal to accept the representatives of Kasavubu to occupy seats in the United Nations, which runs counter to the true interests of the Congolese people.

Touré said: Guinea is determined to maintain trusting and friendly relations with the people of all countries who are struggling for genuine democracy and genuine freedom. He called on the people of Asian and African countries to actively unite and support each other, and called on all peace and progressive forces to unite and eradicate imperialism.

He finally called on all levels of the Guinean Democratic Party organizations and all party members to redouble their efforts to realize Guinea's first three-year economic construction plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, November 27th: The Guinean Press Agency published a commentary on the 27th, condemning the United States for manipulating the United Nations to pass a resolution to accept the Kasavubu delegation to attend the United Nations General Assembly. The commentary pointed out: "This vote, made after unprecedented conspiracies and pressures in the history of the United Nations General Assembly, is the result of the policy pursued by the United States and its Western allies."

The commentary said, "This act, which blatantly violates the fundamental law of the Congo, is a serious precedent that will have a great impact on the Congo and internationally. In fact, immediately following this vote, the Republic of Guinea and the Republic of Mali withdrew from the Conciliation Commission, because the United Nations has already effectively recognized the dictatorial power of Kasavubu and Mobutu, and (sending) this Conciliation Commission has become meaningless."

The commentary emphasized, "We have said it before, and we want to say it again now, the United States government bears a serious responsibility for the development of the situation in the Congo."

    谴责帝国主义破坏刚果独立
    美国操纵联合国接纳卡萨武布代表团违背刚果人民利益
    新华社基西杜古24日电　几内亚总统、几内亚民主党总书记塞古·杜尔强烈谴责帝国主义对非洲的侵略和压迫。他指出，伪装起来的帝国主义的新殖民主义是当前的主要危险。
    塞古·杜尔是在基西杜古举行的几内亚民主党第二届全国干部大会上致闭幕词时说这番话的。这个历时四天的大会在24日闭幕。大会通过了关于政治和经济问题的决议。
    塞古·杜尔在闭幕词中谴责法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆所进行的殖民镇压战争；他强调指出，在法帝国主义者的政策和阿尔及利亚人民的独立之间，没有采取中间立场的余地。
    在谈到刚果局势时，杜尔谴责帝国主义旨在分裂刚果和破坏刚果独立的阴谋。
    杜尔说，几内亚已决定让几内亚代表退出联合国派往刚果的调解委员会，这是因为美国强使联合国通过它提出的主张接纳卡萨武布的代表在联合国占据席位的动议，而这是同刚果人民的真正利益背道而驰的。
    杜尔说：几内亚坚决要同为争取真正民主和真正自由而斗争的各国人民保持信任和友好的关系。他呼吁亚非各国人民积极团结、相互支持，呼吁一切和平和进步力量团结一致来根除帝国主义。
    他最后号召几内亚民主党各级组织和全体党员为实现几内亚第一个三年经济建设计划而加倍努力。
    新华社科纳克里27日电　几内亚新闻社27日发表评论，谴责美国操纵联合国通过接纳卡萨武布的代表团出席联合国大会的决议。评论指出：“这次经过在联合国大会的历史上前所未闻的阴谋诡计和压力而作出的表决，是美国及其西方盟国所奉行的政策的结果。”
    评论说，“这个公然违背刚果的根本法的行动，是一个严重的先例，将在刚果和国际上产生很大的影响。事实上，紧接着这次表决，几内亚共和国和马里共和国就退出调解委员会，因为联合国已经在实际上承认了卡萨武布和蒙博托的独裁权力，（派出）这个调解委员会已经成为毫无意义。”
    评论强调指出，“我们已经说过，现在我们要再说一遍，美国政府对刚果的事态发展负有严重的责任。”
