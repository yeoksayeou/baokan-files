The Executive Committee pays tribute to the struggle of the Afro-Asian people who are pushing the liberation movement towards victory. The Committee emphasizes its desire to implement the Conakry Resolutions. The Committee also notes that the basic tendency of imperialism is to maintain their economic and strategic interests by handing over power to a bunch of agents. Imperialism seeks to strengthen the position of these agents and force them to participate in the exploitation of their own people. The Executive Committee believes that the acts of the United States, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries, and the Central Treaty Organization countries to suppress the liberation movement through intervention—as clearly demonstrated in the Algerian War, the Congo, Laos, and Indochina events—show that the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are consistent in achieving the goals of imperialism. The difference between them lies only in plotting more effective ways to bring colonial countries into the overall scope of imperialism. The Committee draws the attention of organizations participating in liberation movements around the world to the fact that the economic and strategic importance of colonial and semi-colonial countries is always extremely important to imperialism, because imperialism relies on these countries to obtain raw materials, sell its industrial products, and make investments.

The Executive Committee calls on the Secretariat to take the following steps: first, to observe the situation in Asia and Africa, especially in places with European immigrants (Kenya, Rhodesia, South Africa) and places of great importance to imperialism with abundant raw materials and strategic positions (Congo, Bahrain Islands, Oman, Occupied South Yemen), places where military bases have been established, where nuclear weapons have been stored and are about to be stored (North Africa, Bizerte, Morocco, Japan, Turkey), and divided countries (such as Korea, Vietnam, and Somalia). It is very clear that the struggles in these regions are taking a more acute form, as evidenced by the situations in Algeria, Kenya, and Cameroon. Secondly, constantly remind world public opinion of the conspiracies plotted by imperialists to suppress the people's struggle for independence, and vigorously expose imperialist conspiracies disguised in new forms, such as the imperialist assassination conspiracy to murder Dr. Moumié.

The Executive Committee believes that it is urgent to implement the Conakry Conference's resolution on funds to aid and strengthen organizations and groups that are making every effort to assume leadership responsibilities.

The Executive Committee requests the Secretariat to immediately contact the liberation movements in Latin America in order to establish a united anti-imperialist front.

The Executive Committee reiterates its belief that the struggle of all nations against colonialism and its remnants is one of the main factors in establishing the principles of independence and lasting peace.

Therefore, the Executive Committee calls on all Afro-Asian countries to reaffirm their determination, concentrate their forces and strengthen cooperation to immediately eliminate all forms of colonialism.

    亚非人民团结组织执行委要员会会议通过总决议
    号召亚非国家全力合作消灭殖民主义
    斥美国和北大西洋集团策划新阴谋镇压民族独立运动
    本报讯　亚非人民团结组织执行委员会最近在贝鲁特举行的会议上通过了一项总决议，全文如下：
    执行委员会向亚非人民正在把解放运动推向胜利的斗争致敬。委员会强调它执行科纳克里决议的愿望。委员会还注意到，帝国主义的基本倾向是通过把权力交给一帮代理人的办法来维护他们的经济和战略利益，帝国主义设法加强这些代理人的地位并迫使他们参加对本国人民的剥削。执行委员会认为，美国、北大西洋公约组织国家、东南亚条约组织国家和中央条约组织国家通过干涉来镇压解放运动的行为——这清楚地表现于阿尔及利亚战争、刚果、老挝和印度支那的事件中——表明，美国和北大西洋公约组织对于实现帝国主义的目标，是一致的。它们之间的不同只在于策划更有效的办法来把殖民地国家纳入帝国主义的总范围之中。委员会提请参加全世界各国解放运动的组织注意这样一个事实：殖民地和半殖民地国家的经济和战略重要性，对于帝国主义是始终极端重要的，因为帝国主义依靠这些国家获得原料，出售它的工业品和进行投资。
    执行委员会号召书记处采取下列步骤：首先是观察亚非的局势，特别是有欧洲移民的地方（怯尼亚、罗得西亚、南非）和对帝国主义具有重要意义的拥有丰富原料和战略地位的地方（刚果，巴林群岛，阿曼，被占领的南也门），建立了军事基地，已经存放核武器和即将存放核武器的地方（北非、比塞大、摩洛哥、日本、土耳其），以及被分裂的国家（如朝鲜，越南和索马里）。十分明显，这些地区的斗争正在采取更加尖锐的形式，阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚和喀麦隆的情况证明了这一点。其次是不断提醒世界舆论注意帝国主义者为了镇压人民争取独立的斗争而策划的阴谋，大力揭露以新形式伪装的帝国主义阴谋，例如杀害穆米埃博士的帝国主义的暗杀阴谋。
    执行委员会认为，迫切需要执行科纳克里会议关于用来援助和加强尽力承担领导责任的组织和团体的款项的决议。
    执行委员会要求书记处立即同拉丁美洲的解放运动取得联系，以便建立反帝统一战线。
    执行委员会重申它的信念：各国人民反对殖民主义及其残余的斗争，是确立独立和持久和平的原则的主要因素之一。
    因此，执行委员会号召所有亚非国家重申它们的决心，集中力量和加强合作来立即消灭各种形式的殖民主义。
