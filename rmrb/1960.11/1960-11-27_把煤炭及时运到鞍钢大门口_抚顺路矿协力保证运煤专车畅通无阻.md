Delivering Coal to Angang's Doorstep in a Timely Manner
Fushun Railway and Mining Cooperate to Ensure Smooth Flow of Coal Transport Trains
    
    (Our report) According to the Liaoning Daily: Fushun Daguantun Station and the Fushun Mining Bureau closely cooperated to organize "Five-Fixed" coal transport trains between Daguantun Station and Lingshan Station, delivering large quantities of coal to Angang's doorstep in a timely manner to support the sustained high production of steel. After implementing the "Five-Fixed" system, the time for each coal train run was shortened by an average of 1.6 hours compared to the past. Due to the accelerated turnaround of vehicles, from October 8th to November 15th, an average of 101 more coal cars were transported each day.

    The "Five-Fixed" coal trains were developed on the basis of the previous one-stop transportation system. The "Five-Fixed" refers to: fixed locomotives for coal transport trains, fixed train drivers, fixed coal car marshaling personnel, fixed departure and arrival times, and fixed operating routes, thereby ensuring that coal cars run at high speed on time and on designated routes. Before the implementation of the "Five-Fixed" system, coal trains departing from Fushun to Lingshan were pulled by whichever locomotive was available, and the timely departure of coal trains was often affected by waiting for locomotives; sometimes the departure and running lines were occupied by other trains, preventing the coal trains from running on time. Now, locomotives and departure lines are fixed specifically for coal trains, so coal trains can depart on time once they are marshaled. After fixing coal car marshaling personnel, special personnel are assigned to marshal the loaded cars sent to the station by each mine in a timely manner; fixing train drivers facilitates familiarity with the route and accelerates running speed.

    In the operation of the "Five-Fixed" coal trains, the relevant railway departments and the railway and mining enterprises closely cooperated with each other, working together to ensure that each link was tightly connected. The Lingshan Locomotive Depot selected excellent drivers and four high-quality locomotives to serve as the "leading force". Stations along the line strengthened transportation organization plans, mastered the passing times of coal trains, and ensured the smooth flow of coal trains. In addition to ensuring that vehicles are unloaded and loaded as soon as they arrive, the staff of each coal mine station of the Fushun Mining Bureau also broke the conventional practice of sending coal cars to the handover line and waiting for railway locomotives to pick them up. They assembled the loaded coal cars into trains and promptly used mine shunting engines to directly send them to Daguantun Station, where station marshaling personnel jointly assembled them into coal transport trains, reducing the waiting time for each other and accelerating vehicle turnaround. The staff of Daguantun Station also frequently went deep into the mines to understand the production situation in the next three to five days in order to allocate sufficient empty cars. On November 11th and 12th, the mines had high production, and all spare empty cars were used up. Thanks to the railway staff's prior understanding of the production situation, they transferred empty cars from nearby lines to load coal that night, transporting as much as was produced. A total of 23 coal trains were dispatched in two days, all on time.

### 把煤炭及时运到鞍钢大门口  抚顺路矿协力保证运煤专车畅通无阻

    把煤炭及时运到鞍钢大门口
    抚顺路矿协力保证运煤专车畅通无阻
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：抚顺大官屯车站和抚顺矿务局密切协作，在大官屯车站和灵山车站间组织开行“五定”运煤专车，把大量煤炭及时送到鞍钢大门口，支援钢铁持续高产。实行“五定”以后，煤车运行一次的时间平均比过去缩短一点六小时。由于加快了车辆周转，从10月8日到11月15日，每天平均多运出一百零一车煤。
    “五定”煤车是在过去一条龙运输的基础上发展起来的。“五定”是：固定运煤列车的火车头、固定火车司机、固定煤车编组人员、固定发车、到达时间和固定运行线路，从而保证煤车按点、按线高速运行。没有实行“五定”以前，从抚顺发往灵山的煤车，是哪个机车赶上就由哪个机车拉，经常因为等待机车影响煤车正点出发；有时因发车线和运行线被别的车占着，使煤车不能正点运行。现在专为煤车固定了火车头和发车线，煤车编组好了就可以正点出发。固定煤车编组人员以后，各矿送到站内来的重车有专人及时给编组好；固定了火车司机便于熟悉路段加快运行速度。
    在开行“五定”煤车中，铁路各有关部门和路矿之间互相密切配合，齐心协力，一环紧扣一环。灵山机务段选出优秀司机和四台质量良好的火车头担任“龙头”。沿线各站加强了运输组织计划，掌握煤炭专车通过时间，保证煤炭专车畅通无阻。抚顺矿务局各煤矿站职工，除了做到车辆随到随卸随装外，并打破过去把煤车送到交接线等待铁路机车来取的常规，把装好后的煤车组成列车，及时用矿内调车机直接送到大官屯车站，由车站编组人员合编成运煤列车，压缩了互相等接的时间，加快了车辆周转。大官屯车站职工也经常深入矿内了解三、五天内的生产情况，以便配备足够的空车。11月11日和12日矿内大高产，备用空车全部用完，由于铁路职工事先了解生产情况，当夜把附近沿线空车都调去装煤，产多少运多少，两天共开出煤车二十三列全部正点。
