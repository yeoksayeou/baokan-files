    "Not Ashamed to Ask Those Below"
    --Six Farewells to Comrades Supporting Agricultural Production at the Front Lines
    Ge Song
    Agricultural production is a field of knowledge, and to understand and master this field, one must put in a lot of hard work. As the saying goes: learning, learning, requires "learning" and "asking." The word "ask" is particularly important.

    Many of the comrades who have gone to the front lines of agricultural production have lived in cities and worked in offices for a long time in the past, and they do not understand or are not familiar with the situation of rural production and work. Some comrades have worked and lived in the countryside in the past, but if you ask them about the appearance of rural construction today, they are not very clear. Our socialist new countryside is changing rapidly, with rural areas changing every day. The work and problems facing everyone are also very new, which also requires understanding and familiarity. How to understand, how to become familiar? This cannot be separated from the word "ask." Even if the situation is gradually understood and familiar in the future, in order to do a good job in running agriculture in a big way and running grain in a big way, constantly revolutionizing and moving forward forever, this word "ask" can never be separated. We must ask at all times, learn at all times, and solve the new contradictions and new problems that arise in our work at all times. "Asking" is a lifelong matter.

    Ask whom? Ask grassroots cadres, ask old peasants, ask all laborers, in a word: ask the masses. "Of all the principles, the Party's leadership is the first; of all the plans, the mass line is the first." This is absolutely true. When we ask the masses, we are learning from the masses, which is to follow the mass line. As long as we have this spirit of "not being ashamed to ask those below" and learning from the masses, we can overcome difficulties, shoulder heavy burdens, and shoulder them well.

    The example of Lu Genze, a famous labor model in Jilin Province, is worth learning for everyone. Since Lu Genze participated in agricultural production in 1948, he has mastered rich agricultural scientific knowledge and become an agricultural expert through the continuous cultivation of the Party and his own hard work over the past ten years. His trick is mainly the four big words of "being fond of asking and studying hard." In the past two years alone, last year and this year, he has consulted Jin Runzhi, a teacher at Yanbian Agricultural College, on more than 100 difficult problems, greatly enriching his agricultural scientific knowledge. From the old peasants, he also learned a whole set of rice production experience. This spirit of "being fond of asking and studying hard" will always be an example for us to learn from.

    Taking "asking those below" as an honor and not as a "shame" is not an easy task. This requires, first of all, correcting our position, putting down our airs, and having the spirit of being a humble pupil. If you pretend to understand when you don't, and pretend to know when you don't, then you won't learn anything. Whether or not one is willing to "not be ashamed to ask those below" and is willing to learn from the masses is, in the final analysis, a matter of world outlook. In the old society, people with a bourgeois world outlook always thought that they were great, while the masses were just "rabble," stupid, not worth "asking," and even considered "asking those below" as a "shame." We are Marxists, we believe in historical materialism, the people are the creators of history, the people have endless wisdom, the laborers are the smartest, and all undertakings will accomplish nothing without the broad masses. Therefore, we are brave in "asking those below" and take "asking those below" as an honor, precisely because we believe in the masses and rely on the strength of the masses, we can be invincible and win every battle.

    Ask well, learn well! Ask until old age, learn until old age!

    “不耻下问”
    ——六送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    农业生产是一门学问，要懂得和精通这一门学问，须得下一番苦功夫。俗话说：学问学问，要“学”要“问”。这个“问”字特别重要。
    走上农业生产第一线的同志，其中有许多人过去长期住在城市里，在办公室里工作，对农村的生产、工作的情况是不了解和不熟悉的。有的同志过去虽然也在农村工作过和生活过，但是若问他今天农村建设的面貌，他也并不十分清楚。我们社会主义的新农村是日新月异，千变万化的，农村面貌一天一个样子。摆在大家面前的工作和问题，也是非常新鲜的，这同样需要去了解，去熟悉。如何了解，如何熟悉？这就离不了一个“问”字。即使将来情况逐渐了解了，熟悉了，而为了做好大办农业，大办粮食的工作，不断革命，永远前进，这个问字也是始终离不了的。必须时时刻刻地问，时时刻刻地学，时时刻刻去解决工作中出现的新的矛盾，新的问题。“问”是一辈子的事情。
    向谁问？向基层干部问，向老农民问，向一切劳动者问，一句话：向群众问。“千条万条，党的领导第一条，千计万计，群众路线第一计”，这是千真万确的。我们向群众问，就是向群众学习，也就是走群众路线。只要有了这种“不耻下问”地向群众学习的精神，我们就能克服困难，把重担子挑起来，而且挑得好。
    吉林省著名劳动模范吕根泽的榜样值得大家学习。吕根泽从1948年参加农业生产到现在，十多年中，经过党的不断培养和自己的刻苦钻研，掌握了丰富的农业科学知识，成为农业专家。他的窍门，主要就是“好问苦学”四个大字。单是去年和今年两年，他就向延边农学院教员金润植请教了一百多个疑难问题，大大丰富了农业科学知识。从老农民那里，他又学到了一整套水稻生产经验。这种“好问苦学”的精神，永远是我们大家学习的榜样。
    以“下问”为荣，而不以为“耻”，这不是一件轻而易举的事。这首先要端正立场，放下架子，有虚心当小学生的精神。如果不懂装懂，强不知以为知，那就什么也学不到。肯不肯“不耻下问”，愿不愿向群众学习，归根到底是一个世界观问题。在旧社会里，有资产阶级世界观的人，总是认为自己很了不起，而群众不过是“群氓”，是愚蠢的，不值得一“问”，而且以“下问”为“耻”。我们是马克思主义者，我们信仰历史唯物主义，人民群众是历史的创造者，人民群众具有无穷无尽的智慧，劳动者最聪明，一切事业离开广大群众，就一事无成。因此，我们勇于“下问”，以“下问”为荣，正因为我们相信群众，依靠群众的力量，我们就能无坚不摧，战无不胜。
    问得好，学得好！问到老，学到老！
