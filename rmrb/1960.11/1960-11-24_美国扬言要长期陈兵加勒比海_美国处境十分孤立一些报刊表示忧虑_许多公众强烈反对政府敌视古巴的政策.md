Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch from Washington:  U.S. State Department spokesman White, speaking to reporters on the 22nd, brazenly clamored that the U.S. armed forces sent to the Caribbean region would remain there "indefinitely." He said, "There are no plans to withdraw these troops at present.  These troops will continue to remain there as long as it is deemed necessary."

Yesterday, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp" left Boston to join the U.S. naval and air forces dispatched to the Caribbean on the 17th.

At the same time, some reactionary U.S. newspapers continue to cooperate with the U.S. government's actions, clamoring for further measures to invade Cuba. Hearst Jr., in the "New York American," blatantly advocated a military blockade of Cuba. He wrote, "Cuba must be blockaded with the navy."  Baldwin, the military commentator for the "New York Times," also put forward the same opinion, advocating that the United States blockade Cuba "without declaring war."

However, some American newspapers simultaneously expressed concern about the fact that the United States' blatant pursuit of the "big stick policy" in the Caribbean has not been supported by other countries, including some Latin American governments, making the United States' situation very isolated and embarrassing.  The "New York Times" correspondent in Rio de Janeiro reported that "Brazil hopes that the United States will consult with Latin American governments, or at least notify them in advance of the dispatch of warships."

"I.F. Stone's Weekly," in a commentary, pointed out that "the wave of revolution sweeping through Central America" is the United States "reaping what it sowed." The commentary cited facts regarding the U.S. monopoly capital's frantic plunder of Central American countries and its support for the local dictatorial regimes. The commentary said, "Is it any wonder that Castro is a hero in Latin America, while we appear to be the main obstacle to the desire of the southern neighbors of the United States to live a better life?" The commentary said, "To our shame, American imperialism in Central America is not a propaganda slogan, it is a reality."

Many in the American public also strongly oppose the U.S. policy of antagonism towards Cuba.  A "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" was recently established in the United States, with more than 5,000 people participating, including legal professionals, scientists, journalists, and representatives of youth students. According to the committee's spokesperson, the U.S. police authorities are persecuting the organizers and members of the committee.  However, the committee has launched active struggles throughout the country.

    美国扬言要长期陈兵加勒比海
    美国处境十分孤立一些报刊表示忧虑
    许多公众强烈反对政府敌视古巴的政策
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人怀特22日对新闻记者发表谈话，公然叫嚣美国出动到加勒比海地区的武装部队将“无限期地”留在那里。他说，“目前并没有撤回这些部队的打算。只要认为需要，这些部队将继续留在那里。”
    昨天，美国航空母舰“黄蜂号”已经离开波士顿前往加勒比海，加入美国17日派往那里的海空部队。
    同时，美国一些反动报刊继续配合美国政府的行动，叫嚷采取进一步的措施来侵略古巴。小赫斯特在“纽约美国人报”上发表文章，露骨地主张对古巴进行军事封锁。他写道，“必须用海军来封锁古巴”。“纽约时报”的军事评论员鲍德温也提出同样的意见，他主张美国“不宣战”就封锁古巴。
    但是一些美国报纸同时流露了对这样的事实的忧虑：美国明目张胆地在加勒比海推行“大棒政策”得不到其他国家、包括一些拉丁美洲国家政府的支持，这使美国的处境十分孤立和难堪，“纽约时报”驻里约热内卢记者报道说，“巴西希望美国同拉丁美洲国家政府磋商，或者至少事先把派遣军舰一事通知它们。”
    “斯通周刊”在一篇评论中指出，“革命的浪潮正在席卷中美洲”是美国“自食苦果”。评论列举事实谈到美国垄断资本对中美洲国家的疯狂掠夺和对当地的独裁政权的支持。评论说，“难道这有什么奇怪吗：卡斯特罗是拉丁美洲的英雄，而我们却表现为美国南部邻国要过较好的生活的愿望的主要障碍？”评论说，“使我们羞愧的是，美国帝国主义在中美洲不是一句宣传口号，它是一个现实。”
    美国国内许多公众也强烈反对美国敌视古巴的政策。在美国不久前成立了一个“争取对古巴公正关系的斗争委员会”，参加这个委员会的已有五千多人，其中包括法律工作者、科学家、记者、青年学生代表。据委员会的发言人说，美国警察当局正在迫害这个委员会的组织者和委员会的成员。但是委员会仍在全国各地展开了积极的斗争。
