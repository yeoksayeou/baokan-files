    Drawing
    (Nursery rhyme)
    Song Tao

    The bright light dazzles,
    Xiao Ke learns to draw under the lamp,
    A stroke, a wipe,
    He draws an old mother.
    Grandma squints and smiles,
    Asking him, "What is this drawing,
    The eyes look like pea pods,
    But the mouth is as big as a bowl?"
    Before grandma could finish speaking,
    Xiao Ke rushed to answer,
    "It's drawing Wang Dama next door,
    Free from a big pile of housework,
    Participating in the neighborhood sewing group,
    So happy that her heart is blossoming;
    Her name is on the honor roll,
    Wearing a big red flower on her chest,
    Her mouth is smiling non-stop,
    Tears are falling from her eyes."

    画画
    （儿歌）
    宋涛雪亮的灯光耀眼花，小克在灯下学画画，划一划、擦一擦，画出了一个老妈妈。奶奶看了眯眼笑，问他“这是画的啥，眼睛好像豌豆角，嘴巴倒有碗口大？”奶奶的话还没说完，小克就抢着把话答：“画的是隔壁王大妈，摆脱了家务一大把，参加了里弄缝纫组，心里乐得开了花；名字登上了光荣榜，胸前戴上了大红花，嘴巴笑得合不拢，眼里落下了泪花花。”
