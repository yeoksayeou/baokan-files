Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 8th: The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Party committees at all levels continuously strengthen their leadership over urban people's communes, ensuring the further development and continuous consolidation and improvement of the communes.

Chongqing currently has thirty-nine urban people's communes. Since the establishment of these communes, various undertakings have developed rapidly. Therefore, strengthening Party leadership has become the key to consolidating and developing urban communes. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC and various district committees, from the very beginning, regarded establishing and improving Party organizations and cultivating leading cadres and backbone forces as the main links in the work of urban people's communes. On the one hand, the Municipal Committee summarized and promoted the experience of Qixinggang People's Commune, the earliest established in the city, and Shangxinjie People's Commune, which had relatively advanced work, in developing Party organizations, selecting cadres, and improving the organizational structure of the commune. On the other hand, it sent cadres deep into Daxigou, Mitingzi, Shapingba, and other people's communes, and organized Party member cadres from agencies, factories, mines, and schools to go to various communes to specifically help the communes establish Party organizations in a planned way. Now, each commune has established a Party committee, and 129 sub-communes have established Party branches. Many key production and living departments have gradually established separate or joint Party groups, and the strength of the Party has been greatly strengthened. Many outstanding Party members have taken on leading and key positions in various departments of the commune. They quickly established the Party's leadership core in their respective work positions, uniting the activists among the surrounding working people, forming a backbone team, and promoting the continuous leap forward of various tasks.

While strengthening the Party's leadership force, Party committees at all levels also selected a group of advanced figures and activists with advanced thinking, high enthusiasm, and good work style from municipal and district factories, mines, enterprises, agencies, and urban working people to enrich the organizational structure of various communes and sub-communes. At present, urban people's communes and sub-communes throughout the city have selected and equipped more than 4,000 full-time and part-time cadres, factory directors of commune-run factories, directors of nurseries, heads of canteens, heads of service stations, and transport team leaders. The Municipal Committee also used various districts as units to run various specialized and spare-time Party schools and training classes to help these new cadres quickly improve their policy and ideological level and business management capabilities. With the help of the Municipal Party School, ten urban people's communes in the urban area have universally established spare-time Party schools, and more than 1,000 cadres and activists have participated in the study in batches.

Strengthening the political and ideological work of urban people's commune members is another important task of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC and the various district committees. Since March, the Municipal Committee and the various district committees have closely combined the Party's current central tasks and the commune's current central tasks to publicize the Party's guidelines, policies, and the current excellent domestic and international situation to the commune members. The district committees and Party committees of various communes were all headed by secretaries, and more than 1,200 instructors and reporters were selected to give multiple reports to the vast number of commune members. The commune members also had high learning enthusiasm. They successively held many discussion meetings and symposiums to enthusiastically discuss the Party's guidelines, policies, and the benefits that collectivization has brought to the working people. Some communes and commune-run factories also held various exhibitions to educate the commune members on running the commune diligently and thriftily through vivid and specific facts. Now, commune cadres and members are actively participating in various political and cultural studies, and the political consciousness and cultural level of the vast number of commune members have been improved compared to the past.

Fully utilizing the various favorable conditions of large cities and incorporating commune-run enterprises into the national plan through Party leadership and the huge influence of the state-owned economy is the third major measure taken by Party committees at all levels in Chongqing to strengthen leadership over communes. The industry, farms, and collective living welfare undertakings run by the people's communes are developing rapidly. The Party must guide and support these commune-run enterprises and undertakings according to the principles of socialist enterprise management so that they can adapt to the needs of national construction. While vigorously leading the communes to develop production, the Municipal Committee adopted the method of linking and cooperating state-owned factories and mines and state-owned commerce with urban communes, and gradually incorporated the production of commune-run industries into the national plan. At present, 70% to 80% of the commune-run factories in urban communes throughout the city have established close cooperative relationships with nearby large state-owned factories and enterprises. Many large factory and mine Party committees have also sent a group of veteran workers to serve as instructors in various communes. They not only teach technology to the vast number of commune members but also use the excellent qualities of the working class to influence the vast number of commune members. After the commune-run industries are gradually incorporated into the national plan, they avoid localism, decentralism, and capitalist business styles, and establish the idea of serving politics, production, and the people's lives. Nanan District has always relied on external support for small commodities. This year, with the support of state-owned factories and commercial departments, the urban people's communes here have made use of the waste materials, waste products, and wild plants of large factories to actively develop the production of small commodities in a planned way. They have successively established three small commodity production streets and seventy-one factories, producing more than 160 kinds of small commodities and small hardware in batches, giving full play to the role of commune-run industries in serving the people's lives.

    健全党的组织　选派有力干部　培训各种人材
    重庆加强党对城市公社的领导
    保证公社不断巩固发展，促进各项生产持续跃进
    新华社重庆8日电　中共重庆市委和各级党委不断加强对城市人民公社的领导，保证了公社的进一步发展和不断巩固、提高。
    重庆市现在有三十九个城市人民公社，这些公社建立以后，各项事业发展很快，因此，加强党的领导，就成为巩固和发展城市公社的关键。中共重庆市委和各区委一开头就把建立和健全党的组织、培养领导干部和骨干力量，作为城市人民公社工作中的主要环节。市委一面总结、推广全市最早成立的七星岗人民公社和工作较先进的上新街人民公社发展党组织、选拔干部、健全公社组织机构的经验；一面又派干部深入大溪沟、米亭子、沙坪坝等人民公社，并且组织机关、厂矿、学校的党员干部到各公社，具体帮助公社有计划地建立党的组织。现在各公社都建立了党委，一百二十九个分社都建立了党的支部，许多主要的生产和生活部门都逐步建立了单独的或联合的党小组，党的力量已经大大加强。许多优秀的党员担任了公社各个部门的领导职务和主要职务，他们在各工作岗位上很快建立起党的领导核心，团结周围劳动人民中的积极分子，形成了一支骨干队伍，推动各项工作不断跃进。
    在加强党的领导力量的同时，各级党委又从市、区厂矿企业、机关和城市劳动人民中选拔了一批思想先进、干劲足、作风好的先进人物和积极分子充实各公社、分社的组织机构。目前全市各城市人民公社、分社已选拔、配备了脱产和半脱产干部、社属工厂厂长、托儿所长、伙食团长、服务站站长、运输队长共四千多人。市委又以各区为单位，开办了各类专门的和业余的党校、训练班，帮助这些新干部迅速提高政策思想水平和业务管理能力。城区十个城市人民公社在市委党校的帮助下，普遍开办了业余党校，已有一千多名干部和积极分子分批参加了学习。
    加强对城市人民公社社员的政治思想工作，是中共重庆市委和各区区委的另一项重要工作。市委和各区区委从3月份以来，就紧密结合全党当前的中心工作以及公社当前的中心工作，向社员群众宣传党的方针、政策和当前国内、国际的大好形势。各区委和各个公社党委都由书记挂帅，选拔了一千二百多名传授员、报告员，分头向广大社员作了多次报告；社员群众的学习情绪也很高涨，他们先后举行了很多次讨论会、座谈会，热烈讨论党的方针、政策和公社化给劳动人民带来的好处。有些公社和社办工厂还举办各种展览会，通过生动具体的事实向社员进行勤俭办社的教育。现在公社干部和社员都积极参加各种政治和文化学习，广大社员的政治觉悟和文化水平都比过去有了提高。
    充分运用大城市的各种有利条件，通过党的领导和国营经济的巨大影响，把社办企业逐步纳入国家计划，是重庆市各级党委加强对公社领导的第三项重大措施。各人民公社办的工业、农场和集体生活福利事业发展都很快，党对这些社办企业和事业必须按社会主义企业管理原则加以指导和扶持，使它们适应国家建设的需要。市委在大力领导公社发展生产的同时，采取通过国营厂矿企业、国营商业与城市公社挂钩协作的方法，把社办工业的生产逐步纳入了国家计划。现在全市城市公社已有70％到80％的社办工厂与附近的国营大厂企业建立了密切的协作关系。许多大型厂矿党委还派出一批老工人到各公社担任指导员，他们不仅把技术教给公社的广大社员，而且用工人阶级的优秀品质来影响广大社员。社办工业逐步纳入国家计划后，就避免了本位主义、分散主义和资本主义的经营作风，树立起为政治、为生产和为人民生活服务的思想。南岸区需要的小商品一向依靠外地支援，今年这里的各城市人民公社在国营工厂和商业部门支持下，利用大厂的边角废料、废品、野生植物等，有计划地积极发展小商品生产，先后建立了三条小商品生产街、七十一个工厂，成批生产的小商品、小五金达一百六十多种，充分发挥了社办工业为人民生活服务的作用。（附图片）
