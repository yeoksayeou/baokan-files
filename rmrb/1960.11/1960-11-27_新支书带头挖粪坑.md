    New Party Secretary Takes the Lead in Digging a Manure Pit
    The members of the Shiligang Brigade of the Gegang Commune in Yu County, Henan Province, call the new Party Branch Secretary, Wang Jianlun, an "old hand at physical labor," and enthusiastically say, "With the new Party Secretary here, our brigade's production will be new in every way from now on." Wang Jianlun was originally the director of the Yu County Grain Bureau office. He grew up in a poor peasant family, worked as a hired hand for landlords for six years, and has been working in rural areas since liberation, making him an expert in agricultural production. This time, when the Party Committee called for "vigorously developing agriculture and grain production," he actively requested to be transferred downwards and was approved to be the First Secretary of the Party Branch in the Shiligang Brigade. As soon as he arrived in Shiligang, he enthusiastically threw himself into the battle of production.
    Recently, the entire brigade launched a vigorous manure accumulation campaign. The manure pit south of the village had very deep accumulated water due to several heavy rains. The twenty members of the manure accumulation team circled the pit, unable to find a way to get the manure out. At this moment, Wang Jianlun arrived. Without a word, he took off his shoes and socks, rolled up his trousers above his knees, jumped into the manure pit, and shoveled out the black and smelly manure, forkful by forkful. When Communist Youth League member Huang Zhenxiu saw the Party Branch Secretary taking the lead in jumping into the water, she followed him, and as a result, fifteen of the twenty people got into the water. They worked like this for an afternoon and an evening, until late at night, and dug out more than 300 cartloads of good fertilizer from this pit. Secretary Wang's action quickly spread throughout the entire brigade, and under his leadership, the manure accumulation campaign in the entire brigade has seen a new upsurge.

    新支书带头挖粪坑
    河南省?县葛岗公社十里岗大队的社员称新来的党支部书记王建伦是“老领活”，并且热情地说：“新支书一来，咱队的生产今后要样样新了。”王建伦原是?县粮食局办公室主任，从小生长在贫苦的农民家庭里，给地主扛了六年长工，解放后一直在农村工作，对农业生产是老行手。这次党委号召“大办农业、大办粮食”，他就积极要求下放，被批准下放到十里岗大队当党支部第一书记。他一到十里岗就热情地投入了生产战斗。
    最近，全大队开展了轰轰烈烈的积肥运动。村南粪坑因几次大雨，积水很深。积肥专业队的二十个人，围着坑边转圈圈，找不到出粪的办法。这时王建伦来了，他二话没说，就把鞋袜脱掉，裤腿卷过膝盖，跳下粪坑，把又黑又臭的粪肥一杈杈地挖了出来。共青团员黄珍秀见到党支部书记带头跳下水去，也跟着跳了下去，结果二十个人有十五人都下了水。这样干了一下午一晚上，直到深夜，从这个坑里共挖出了三百多车好肥料。王支书的这一行动很快传遍了全大队，在他的带动下，全大队的积肥运动，出现了新的高潮。
