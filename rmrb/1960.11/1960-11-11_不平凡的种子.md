    In Liucun, Bijiang County, nestled between the Gaoligong and Biluo Snow Mountains in northwestern Yunnan, the Lisu brothers speak of PLA soldier Yang Caixue as their good "Ayibah" (older brother). This PLA soldier lived alongside the Lisu brothers for five years, helping them change their "slash-and-burn" farming methods, leading to significant improvements in their impoverished and backward lives.

    Yang Caixue is an assistant at the Bijiang County Military Service Bureau. When he arrived in the border region with his unit five years ago, he saw the Lisu brothers living an impoverished and backward tribal life and became determined to help them change their backwardness. At that time, the military was implementing the conscription system, and some soldiers were beginning to demobilize. He repeatedly pleaded with his superiors: "Let me stay here, I am willing to live with the Lisu brothers for the rest of my life and enter communism with them." Yang Caixue was approved. As soon as he arrived at the Bijiang County Armed Forces Department, he was assigned to Liucun to help the masses develop production.

    Liucun consists of eleven natural villages in a remote area. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, production had greatly developed, but because the original production was backward, life was still very hard. People wore hemp clothing all year round, went barefoot, and the annual harvest was only enough for half the year, relying on hunting and gathering wild vegetables and fruits to survive. When Yang Caixue arrived here, he found it difficult to start work due to language barriers and unfamiliar customs. At this time, he remembered the instructions of his superior: "Work in mountainous areas, especially in ethnic minority areas, is arduous and difficult, but difficulties cannot scare us communists. As long as we can integrate with the masses, we can overcome any difficulty, no matter how great." At the same time, he took out Chairman Mao's article "Serve the People," reading it again and again, each time feeling an increase in boundless courage and confidence.

    The next morning, he put on hemp clothes, shaved his head, and went barefoot to the fields. When he saw people chopping wood on the mountain, he helped them. When he saw people digging the ground, he helped them. After a few days, he simply moved his luggage to the homes of the masses to eat, live, and work with them. At that time, it was the spring ploughing season, and many people did not have enough grain to eat, so he shared his rations with everyone. When the grain ran out, he ate wild vegetables and fruits with the masses. Soon, he became familiar with the masses and learned the Lisu language. People would also take the initiative to consult with him. In this way, he was with everyone all day long, going to the fields and mountains. During rest, he would publicize the Party's policies to the masses and call on them to carry out agricultural technology reforms. The Lisu people did not have the habit of fertilizing the land. When he mobilized the masses to accumulate fertilizer, they expressed doubt, and some people even said, "Eating crops fertilized with manure will cause stomach pain." What to do? He asked his superiors for instructions, and they said, "Show them!" So, he planted six fen of experimental fields and applied thousands of catties of base fertilizer. After the crops grew, he applied two more top dressings. Yang Caixue's crops formed a sharp contrast with the masses' "slash-and-burn" cultivation. At harvest time, he organized the masses to visit and taste the new crops. When the masses saw that some people who ate the fertilized grain did not have stomach pain, their ideological concerns were eliminated, and they began to accumulate fertilizer. Due to the large amount of fertilizer applied, Liucun's spring crops in 1957 achieved a bumper harvest, with yields more than doubling compared to 1956.

    In the spring of 1958, the drums of the Great Leap Forward shook this remote border mountain area. In order to lead the masses in producing more grain, Yang Caixue was determined to build water conservancy projects. But where to find water in this high mountain area of two to three thousand meters above sea level? To find a water source, he carried a bag of dry food and led a few activists, running around in the deep mountain canyons of the Biluo Snow Mountain. When they were hungry, they ate some dry food, and when they were thirsty, they ate a handful of snow. In this way, they finally found a water source. However, this water source was far from the village. In order to bring the water to the village as soon as possible, Yang Caixue climbed the high mountain again to find a shortcut for opening a ditch. To ensure that this project could be completed before transplanting rice seedlings, he returned to the village, arranged the work of converting dry land to paddy fields, and then led a water conservancy team to dig the canal. After more than two months of hard work, the fifteen-li-long ditch was finally dug. Since then, more than 700 mu of paddy fields have appeared in this mountainous area of Liucun.

    The Lisu brothers did not understand the technology of growing rice. After the paddy fields were opened, Yang Caixue taught the masses how to sow and transplant rice seedlings. Just as the seedlings in the rice fields were growing vigorously, unfortunately, a section of the ditch was washed away by melting snow from the mountain. At this time, the weather was very hot, and the seedlings were turned from green to yellow by the scorching sun. Yang Caixue, who was running a high fever, couldn't stay in bed any longer when he heard the news. He got up, organized the masses to carry water for irrigation, and organized the masses to repair the washed-out ditch. After three days of hard work, the ditch was repaired, and water flowed along the ditch into the dry rice fields, saving 700 mu of rice.

    In August, the rice turned yellow. While harvesting in the golden fields, the Lisu people sang: "The snow mountain is high, but not higher than the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; the Nu River is deep, but not deeper than the friendship of the People's Liberation Army." Liucun had a bumper harvest, and the Lisu brothers had enough food. Many Lisu brothers who had never eaten rice before always filled a bowl of white rice before eating and placed it in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, pointing to Chairman Mao and saying to their children: "This rice was given to us by Chairman Mao. We must always remember Chairman Mao's kindness and always follow the Communist Party."

    After more than five years of living together, Yang Caixue has formed a deep relationship with the local Lisu and other ethnic groups. Now, whenever Yang Caixue has to go to the county or other places for meetings or studies, the Lisu brothers always see him off for one stretch of the road after another, affectionately saying to him: "Ayibah (older brother), come back soon."

    Chairman Mao once said: "We communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. When we arrive in a place, we must integrate with the people there, take root and blossom among the people." Yang Caixue is such an extraordinary seed. He sowed all his enthusiasm on the plateau of northwestern Yunnan, planted it in the hearts of the Lisu brothers, took root, blossomed, and bore fruit. (Attached picture)

    不平凡的种子
    新华社记者　段文慧
    在滇西北高黎贡山和碧罗雪山之间的碧江县六村，傈僳族兄弟一提起解放军战士杨才学，都说：他是我们的好“阿益扒”（阿哥）。这个解放军战士和傈僳族兄弟共同生活了五年，帮助他们改变了“刀耕火种”的耕作方法，使他们贫困落后的生活面貌发生了巨大变化。
    杨才学是碧江县兵役局的助理员。当他五年前随部队到边疆时，看到傈僳族兄弟过着贫困落后的原始部落生活，就一心想着帮助兄弟民族改变落后面貌。这时候，部队实行义务兵役制，一部分战士开始复员，他再三请求上级：“把我留在这里吧，我愿意同傈僳兄弟生活一辈子，同他们一齐进入共产主义。”杨才学被批准了，一到碧江县武装部，就被分配到六村帮助群众发展生产。
    六村由十一个自然村组成，地区偏僻。解放后在党的领导下，生产虽然有很大发展，但是因为原来的生产落后，生活仍然很苦，人们终年穿麻布，赤双脚，一年收获只够半年的，其余靠打猎和采集野菜、野果来维持。杨才学一到这里，语言不通，风俗不懂，工作很难着手。这时候，他想起了首长的指示：“山区，特别是兄弟民族区的工作是艰苦的，困难的，但是困难并不能吓倒我们共产党人，只要我们能和群众打成一片，天大的困难我们也能克服。”同时，他拿出毛主席写的“为人民服务”的文章，读了又读，每读一遍都觉得增添了无限的勇气和信心。
    第二天清早，他穿起了麻布衣，光着头、赤着脚下地了。他见人在山上砍柴就去帮着砍柴，见人挖地就去帮着挖地。过了几天，他索性把行李搬到群众家里同吃、同住、同劳动。当时是春耕时期，许多群众没粮吃，他就把自己的口粮分给大家，粮吃完了他就同群众一起吃野菜、野果。不久，他就和群众混熟了，也学会了傈僳话，群众有事也都主动来找他商量。这样，他整天和大家在一起，下田上山，休息时便向群众宣传党的政策，号召群众进行农业技术改革。傈僳人种地没有施肥的习惯，他动员群众积肥时，群众表示怀疑，有的人还说“吃了上粪的庄稼会肚子痛”。怎么办？他请示上级，上级说“做给群众看！”于是，他便种了六分试验田，上了几千斤底肥，庄稼长出来以后他又追了两道肥，杨才学种的庄稼与群众的“刀耕火种”形成了鲜明的对照。收割时，他组织群众来参观、尝新，群众见一些人吃了上过粪的粮食肚子没痛，思想顾虑解除了，开始动手积肥。由于大量施肥，1957年六村的小春作物获得了丰收，产量比1956年翻了一番还多。
    1958年的春天，大跃进的战鼓震动了这个偏僻的边疆山区。杨才学为了领导群众搞好生产多打粮食，决心兴修水利。可是在这拔海两、三千米的高山上，那里找水呢？为了找水源，他背起了干粮袋，领了几个积极分子，在碧罗雪山的深山峡谷里到处奔波，饿了他们吃一点干粮，渴了他们就吃一把雪。这样他们终于找到了一条水源。但是这条水源离村很远，杨才学为了把这股水尽快的引往村里，他又登上高山，找出一条开沟的捷径。为了保证这一工程能在栽秧前完成，他回到村里，把旱地改水田的工作安置好以后，便带了一支水利队伍来开渠。经过两个多月的艰苦劳动，长达十五里的水沟终于挖通了。从此，六村这个山区出现了七百多亩水田。
    傈僳族兄弟不懂种水稻的技术。水田开出来以后，杨才学又教群众如何撒秧，如何栽秧。正当稻田里的禾苗茁壮成长时，不幸水沟有一处被山上的融雪冲垮了。这时，天气很热，禾苗被火红的太阳晒得由青转黄。杨才学正在发高烧，听到这个消息，再也在床上耽不住了，他爬起来一面组织群众背水灌溉，一面组织群众抢修被水冲垮的水沟，经过三天的苦战，水沟修通了，水沿着水沟流进干裂的稻田，七百亩稻子得救了。
    8月，稻子黄了。傈僳人一边在金黄的谷田里收割，一边唱着：“雪山高，高不过共产党、毛主席的恩德；怒江深，深不过人民解放军的情谊。”六村丰收了，傈僳兄弟有了足够食粮。许多从来没有吃过大米饭的傈僳兄弟，吃饭前总是先满满地盛上一碗白米饭，放在毛主席像前，指着毛主席对孩子们说：“这大米饭是毛主席给我们的，我们要永远记住毛主席的恩德，永远跟着共产党走。”
    经过这五年多来的共同生活，杨才学已和当地傈僳等族人民结下了深厚的感情。现在，每当杨才学要到县里或其它地方开会、学习，傈僳兄弟总是送一程又一程，亲切地对他说：“阿益扒（阿哥），早点回来。”
    毛主席曾说过：“我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。”杨才学就是这样一粒不平凡的种子，他把他的全部热情播在滇西北高原上，播种在傈僳兄弟们的心中，生下了根，开了花，结下果。（附图片）
