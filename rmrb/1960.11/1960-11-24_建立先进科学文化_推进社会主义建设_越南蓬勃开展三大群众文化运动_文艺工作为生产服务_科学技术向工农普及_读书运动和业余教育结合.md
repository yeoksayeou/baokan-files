Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi News: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is currently vigorously carrying out reading, popularizing scientific and technological knowledge, and developing literary and artistic movements. These three major mass cultural movements are launched in accordance with the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government's policy of establishing advanced science, culture, and technology to more effectively promote socialist construction.

According to statistics from sixteen provinces, in the first half of this year, more than 3,000 amateur art groups from factories, mines, and agricultural production cooperatives performed for 6 million audiences. Within these six months, cultural institutions in fourteen provinces received 48,430 poems and scripts created by workers and peasants. These works describe the new atmosphere emerging during the socialist transition period, especially the new people and new things emerging from agricultural cooperativization.

A large number of literary and artistic workers responded to the Party's call by going to factories, construction sites, and agricultural production cooperatives to create works reflecting the new life and new figures, or to perform for the broad masses of workers and peasants.

More than fifty writers and poets lived with workers in Haiphong, Nam Dinh, and the Thai Nguyen steel center, with some joining the agricultural cooperativization movement in Ha Dong, Bac Ninh, Quang Binh, and other provinces. Many writers went to the Northwest mountainous areas to understand the changes that the cooperativization movement and democratic reforms brought to ethnic minorities.

This year, twelve central cultural troupes, twenty-four local cultural troupes, and private drama troupes have successively performed in rural areas, mountainous areas, and industrial zones. The Thai Nguyen Provincial Cultural Troupe recently performed for people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous area for four consecutive months, sometimes giving three or four performances a day. Literary and artistic groups in provinces, counties, and townships also created and performed small-scale programs combining current production, which are very popular among the broad masses of audiences.

The work of popularizing science and technology has also achieved great success. Factories and agricultural production cooperatives regularly hold reports and exhibitions on new agricultural technologies and new farming methods. For example, Thai Binh province organized 485 such events in six months, attracting 440,000 people. Yi'an Province, which received a certificate of merit from the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, established scientific and technological research groups in many factories to promote the development of the technological innovation movement. In order to help rural areas expand winter and spring irrigation and water storage work, special training on water conservancy construction was also organized for water conservancy workers and members of agricultural production cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, more than 7,700 people received training in October alone.

The reading movement is being carried out in close combination with spare-time education. Now, there are newspapers and books even in the most remote mountainous areas. People-organized book stations have sprung up everywhere. Thai Binh province had only 465 libraries last year, but this year it has reached 1,245. Sailors also have their own libraries. The fleet of the Haiphong Cement Plant, composed of 700 workers, owns nearly 3,000 books. People in various provinces are now working hard to complete the annual plan for spare-time education. Hung Yen Province plans to have approximately 12,000 students pass the final exams by the end of the year.

    建立先进科学文化　推进社会主义建设
    越南蓬勃开展三大群众文化运动
    文艺工作为生产服务　科学技术向工农普及　读书运动和业余教育结合
    据新华社讯　据越南通讯社河内讯：越南民主共和国目前正蓬勃开展着读书、普及科学技术知识和发展文学艺术运动。这三大群众文化运动是根据越南劳动党和政府关于建立先进的科学、文化、技术，更有效地推进社会主义建设的方针开展起来的。
    据十六个省的统计，今年上半年有三千多个工厂、矿井和农业生产合作社的业余艺术团体为六百万观众作了演出。在这六个月内，十四个省的文化机构收到了工农创作的四万八千四百三十首诗和剧本。这些作品描写社会主义过渡时期出现的新气象，特别是农业合作化中涌现出的新人新事。
    大批的文学艺术工作者响应党的号召，下工厂、去工地，深入农业生产合作社创作反映新的生活和新人物的作品，或者为广大工农演出。
    五十多位作家和诗人同海防、南定和钢铁中心太原的工人们生活在一起，有的投入到河东、北宁、广平和其它省的农业合作化运动。许多作家到达西北山区，了解合作化运动和民主改革给少数民族带来的变化。
    今年已有十二个中央文工团、二十四个地方文工团和民营戏剧团先后到各地农村、山区、工业区演出，太原省文工团最近连续四个月在山区为各族人民演出，有时一天演三、四场。各省、县、乡的文艺团体还自编自演结合当前生产的小型节目，深受广大观众的欢迎。
    普及科学技术的工作也获得了很大的成绩。工厂和农业生产合作社经常举行有关新的农业技术和新的耕作法的报告会和展览会。例如太平省六个月来就组织了四百八十五次，吸引了四十四万人。获得了越南祖国战线中央委员会奖状的宜安省在许多工厂建立了科学技术研究小组，来促进技术革新运动的开展。为了帮助农村扩大冬、春季的灌溉、储水工作，还组织了水利工人和农业生产合作社的社员，进行有关水利建设的专门训练，据不完全统计，仅在10月份内，接受训练的就有七千七百多人。
    读书运动和业余教育紧密结合地在开展着。现在，在最偏僻的山区都有书报。各地人民自己组成的图书站纷纷涌现，太平省去年只有四百六十五个图书馆，今年就达到了一千二百四十五个。船员们也有着自己的图书馆。由七百名工人组成的海防水泥厂的船队就拥有将近三千册图书。各省人民现正努力完成业余教育的年度计划。兴安省计划到年底约有一万二千名学生通过期终考试。
