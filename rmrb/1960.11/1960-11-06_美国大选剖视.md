An Analysis of the American Election
Ping Xi

I.

	The American presidential election campaign has now entered its final stage. The Republican and Democratic candidates, Nixon and Kennedy, are traveling all over the country, delivering speech after speech, attacking each other. The focus of their campaigns is, firstly, in foreign policy, who can more resolutely implement a policy of hostility toward the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, promote a "policy of strength," and intensify international tensions; and secondly, in domestic policy, who is prepared to spend more money and step up arms expansion and war preparations.

	The American election is being held under the following circumstances: the United States is facing its fourth economic crisis since the war; and the U-2 aircraft incident and the sabotage of the Four Power Summit have declared the bankruptcy of the sham peace conspiracy played by American imperialism. The continuous growth of peace forces and the vigorous development of national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have repeatedly frustrated America's war and aggression plans. Within the capitalist world, the trend of disintegration is continuing to develop, and America's prestige is declining, shaking its leading position in the imperialist camp. This situation has become an issue that the next presidential candidate cannot fail to consider first, and a decisive factor in who can win greater favor from the monopoly capitalist groups.

II.

	As everyone remembers, in 1952 and 1956, Eisenhower was elected twice under the banner of "peace and prosperity." Nixon had planned that if the Four Power Summit concluded "amicably," he would participate in the election as a representative of "peace." Kennedy also made early plans, publishing "The Strategy of Peace" in early 1960 as a campaign asset. However, due to the serious threat of economic crisis, the American monopoly capitalist groups are trying to stimulate the American economy by stepping up arms expansion and war preparations. Therefore, neither the Republican Party nor the Democratic Party used the deceptive slogans repeatedly used by Eisenhower in this election, but directly advocated anti-Soviet and anti-communist, arms expansion and war preparations, and the promotion of a "policy of strength." The explicitness of this war clamor has been unprecedented in several election campaigns in the post-war era.

	1. On the point of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, and hostility towards the socialist camp, the Republican and Democratic candidates are almost in unison.

	Nixon said that "containing or stopping the Communists" is "not enough," and America's "goal must be the triumph of freedom throughout the world." He also clamored that in any war against the Soviet Union, the use of nuclear weapons would be "inevitable."

	Kennedy said that communism is "totalitarianism," the socialist countries of Eastern Europe are "enslaved nations," "never recognize the situation behind the Iron Curtain as permanent," and to "deal with" communism, an offensive must be adopted, and efforts must be made to "nurture the seeds of freedom that appear in any cracks in the Iron Curtain."

	2. Nixon and Kennedy are both believers in the bankrupt "policy of strength" and are pioneers in arms expansion and war preparations.

	Nixon began his campaign by advocating a "policy of strength." He declared that if he were elected President of the United States, he would guarantee "the implementation and reliance on this policy." He said: There "cannot be a price limit" in expanding military equipment. He also openly advocated the development of germ warfare and chemical warfare, saying that this is "essential" for the United States.

	Kennedy also clamored that the United States must restore its "strength" and negotiate with the Soviet Union from a "position of strength." Kennedy advocated that the United States must have an "unbreakable" atomic attack force and "effective" conventional military equipment. He demanded that the United States' military appropriations be increased by another 2.5 to 3 billion US dollars.

	3. On the issue of African countries, Nixon and Kennedy both exposed their greedy neo-colonialist true colors.

	Nixon clamored that the situation in the Congo provided the United States with an excellent "opportunity" to infiltrate Africa. "The events that are happening in the heart of Africa, which are simply shocking the world, just provide us with such an opportunity--as long as we dare to think and act to seize this opportunity."

	Kennedy proposed a six-point plan to control Africa through the United Nations, and to carry out economic infiltration by providing "surplus food" and "opening up capital."

	4. Regarding Cuba, the two presidential candidates are equally vicious. Nixon bluntly stated that the US government should use the methods of "overthrowing former Guatemalan President Arbenz."

	Kennedy clamored that the US "trade embargo" against Cuba is "not enough." The United States should strive for "the support of the United States' embargo against Cuba from other countries in the Western Hemisphere and European allies." The United States should confiscate Cuban assets in the United States and "strengthen" the so-called "Cuban counter-revolutionary forces that are expected to overthrow the Castro regime."

	5. On the China issue, Nixon and Kennedy have both tried their best to express that they will continue to pursue a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, oppose the recognition of China, obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, and openly use the issue of China's territory Taiwan, Jinmen, and Mazu as a means of their election campaign. Kennedy rehashed Dulles' plan of "trading Jinmen and Mazu for Taiwan and Penghu," which he put forward after the failure of the brinkmanship policy, and blatantly promoted the conspiracy of "two Chinas"; while Nixon clamored that the United States should directly occupy Jinmen and Mazu by force. However, no matter who it is, it is the same for the permanent occupation of China's territory Taiwan.

	From the speeches of the two parties' candidates and from the campaign programs published by the two parties, people can clearly see that there is no difference between the US Republican Party and the Democratic Party in promoting aggression and war policies, in hostility towards the Soviet Union, China, and the socialist camp, and in promoting neo-colonialism. They are all trying to intensify international tensions.

III.

	On domestic issues, after barely surviving the economic crisis of 1957-1958, the shadow of a new economic crisis has enveloped the entire United States. The three important pillars of the US economy—steel, automobiles, and construction—have been declining continuously since the third quarter of this year. The US government recently announced that the US industrial production index for September has fallen to the lowest point this year—107 (with the average for 1957 as 100). In agriculture, "surplus agricultural products" are unsalable, agricultural product prices are falling, farmers' incomes are decreasing, and large numbers of farmers are flowing into cities. The United States has maintained a huge unemployed workforce, with more than four million unemployed. This is a phenomenon that has not occurred since the end of the economic crisis of 1957-1958. When it rains, it pours. Recently, there has been a rush to buy gold on the capitalist world market, which has sharpened and surfaced the dollar crisis. Faced with this situation, economic issues have naturally become an important issue in this presidential election.

	Kennedy used his advantageous position as the opposition party to fiercely attack the Republican government's economic policies. In his speech on October 27, he said that the United States was clearly entering "the third recession in six years." He said, "We can't afford another recession." He pointed out that in the first nine months of this year, the US economy had declined, and "more than any (Western) major country." He also accused the Republican Party of only accounting for 54% of the steel industry's productivity after eight years in power, and said, "It's time to admit that there is a steel crisis in the United States." He also criticized Nixon for neglecting that the United States "has five million unemployed and three million partially unemployed." While Nixon had to admit that the United States was encountering "certain difficulties," he was still pretending to be fat, boasting that the United States was the "richest" country. Nixon pushed the responsibility for the rush to buy gold in the capitalist world market onto Kennedy, saying that the "main factor" in the formation of this trend was Kennedy's "inadequate suggestions on American fiscal and monetary policy, which caused widespread concern." He believed that Kennedy's plan to increase the federal budget by 15 billion US dollars in one year would have disastrous consequences for the US economy.

	As for how to find a way out? Kennedy had proposed as early as July 10 to allocate another 2.5 to 3 billion US dollars to avoid a possible economic recession this winter. Kennedy emphasized the need to "maintain" the value of the dollar, "restore the balance of payments," and asked the United States' "allies" to "share" the "economic burden" of the United States' military aggression and economic expansion in the world. Nixon then assured voters that their dollars were "insured," and that if he became president, he would "guarantee" the value of the dollar. On agricultural policy, Kennedy proposed a so-called "active policy in supply management" to increase product prices and farmers' incomes. On the other hand, Nixon stated that he had nothing to do with the agricultural policy of the Eisenhower government, and on the other hand, he proposed a plan to expand the use of agricultural products and prevent the accumulation of "surplus agricultural products." Kennedy also offered a blank check, saying that if he were elected president, he would devote himself to achieving "82 million jobs" and increasing the minimum wage from one dollar per hour to 1.25 dollars. Nixon, not wanting to be left behind, proposed an increase of 1.15 dollars per hour.

	Nixon and Kennedy did issue a lot of blank checks, just to win votes. However, they could not come up with any effective measures for the deteriorating US economic situation, and in fact, they all bet their bets on maintaining the "Cold War" and stepping up arms expansion and war preparations. However, even American bourgeois newspapers and economists cannot but admit that no matter what measures the US policy takes, it cannot escape a new "serious economic recession." "The next president - whether Republican or Democrat - will inherit a serious recession."

IV.

	American monopoly organizations have always regarded the "throne" of the American president as one of their main tools. Therefore, no matter who it is, without monopoly capital as the backstage boss, it is impossible to ascend to the "throne" of the White House. Therefore, each presidential candidate is determined behind the scenes by monopoly capitalists and their agents. In this presidential election, it is worth noting that the representatives of the monopoly capital groups are no longer satisfied with the position behind the scenes, and want to directly control the state machine. Democratic candidate Kennedy himself is the son of a Boston financial tycoon. His father has connections with many powerful financial groups. In 1952, Kennedy was elected as a senator. After this election, the Boston "Post," which vigorously promoted Kennedy, received a loan of 500,000 US dollars from old Kennedy. The current Republican presidential candidate, Nixon, was initially placed in politics by the Bank of America in California. In 1952, he was elected as vice president with the support of the California consortium and Wall Street financial tycoons. Now, the Morgan Group has become Nixon's main backstage boss.

	The American monopoly capital group has already arranged everything for the American presidential election, and now it is only waiting for the voters to "choose." And this "right" of "choice" is of course not something that all eligible American citizens can "enjoy." Agence France-Presse said: There are 10 million black people in the United States who are of voting age, but at most only three or four million people can exercise their rights. The reason is that the "hostile attitude" of white people in the southern states will cause many black people to "abstain." Millions of workers who migrate frequently to make a living and cannot settle down in a city will also be deprived of the right to vote. The American people are not at all interested in the presidential election. By the end of October, Nixon and Kennedy's quarrels had already reached a fever pitch, but according to an Associated Press report on October 25: American voters "greatly lack enthusiasm for either candidate." This is not surprising, because the American people know that whether the Democratic Party wins and Kennedy is elected, or the Republican Party continues to govern and Nixon is elected, they are all birds of a feather. They will all continue to implement the policy of aggression and the policy of war, which is the current policy of the Eisenhower government. On this point, even the candidates of the two parties frankly admit it. Nixon said: "...If there are two fundamentally different political parties, it is very dangerous, because in this way, the transfer of power from one party to another means that fundamental changes will occur." Kennedy said: When dealing with the Soviet Union, "there is no Democratic way or Republican way." Democratic vice-presidential candidate Johnson also claimed: "It must be made clear that the United States has no differences in dealing with communism."

	This is the true essence of the American two-party system.

    美国大选剖视
    平晰
    一
    美国总统的竞选运动，现在已进入最后阶段。共和党和民主党的候选人，尼克松和肯尼迪走遍全国各地，发表一篇又一篇的演说，互相攻击。他们竞选的重点，一个是在外交政策上，谁能更加坚决地执行对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的敌视政策，推行“实力政策”，加剧国际紧张局势；一个是在内政上，谁准备花更多的钱，加紧扩军备战。
    美国的这次大选是在这样的情况下举行的：美国已面临战后第四次的经济危机；而U—2飞机事件和四国首脑会议的被破坏，已使美帝国主义玩弄的假和平阴谋宣告破产。和平力量的不断壮大，亚、非、拉丁美洲的民族独立运动的蓬勃发展，已使美国的战争计划和侵略计划一再地遭受挫败。在资本主义世界内部，分崩离析的趋势正在继续发展，美国威信日益下降，动摇了它在帝国主义阵营中的领导地位。这种形势，就成为下届总统候选人所不能不首先考虑的问题，并且成为那一个能够博得垄断资本集团更大欢心的决定性因素。
    二
     大家记得，在1952年和1956年，艾森豪威尔是打着“和平和繁荣”这样的旗帜而两度获选的。尼克松曾经这样计划：如果四国首脑会议“和蔼地”结束，他就以“和平的代表”这种姿态来参加竞选。肯尼迪也曾早作打算，在1960年初就出版了“和平的战略”一书，作为竞选中的一项资本。但是，由于经济危机的严重威胁，美国垄断资本集团力图以加紧扩军备战来刺激美国经济。因之，不论共和党也好、民主党也好，在这次竞选中都不再使用艾森豪威尔一再使用过的骗人口号，而是直截了当地鼓吹反苏反共、扩军备战、推行“实力政策”。这种战争叫嚣的露骨程度，是在战后年代的几次竞选中没有过的。
    一、在反苏反共、敌视社会主义阵营这一点上，共和党和民主党的候选人，几乎是腔调一致的。
    尼克松说：“箝制或制止共产党”还是“不够的”，美国的“目的，必须是自由在全世界取得胜利。他还叫嚣在对苏联进行的任何战争中，“不可避免地会使用”核武器。
    肯尼迪说：共产主义是“极权主义”，东欧的社会主义国家是“被奴役国家”，“决不承认铁幕背后的局势是永久的”，“对付”共产主义要采取攻势，要设法“滋养在铁幕上出现的任何裂缝中的自由的种子。”
    二、尼克松和肯尼迪都是破了产的“实力政策”的信徒，都是扩军备战的急先锋。
    尼克松是以鼓吹“实力政策”开始他的竞选活动的。他声言，如果他当选为美国总统，保证“执行和依靠这种政策”。他说：在扩充军备方面“决不能有价格的限额”。他还公开鼓吹发展细菌战和化学战，说这对美国是“必不可少的”。
    肯尼迪也同样叫嚷必须恢复美国的“实力”，在和苏联谈判时必须从“实力地位出发”。肯尼迪主张美国必须有“牢不可破”的原子攻击力量和“有效的”常规军备。他要求把美国的军事拨款再增加二十五亿到三十亿美元。
    三、在对待非洲国家的问题上，尼克松和肯尼迪都暴露了他们那副贪婪的新殖民主义者的本来面目。
    尼克松叫嚷刚果局势给美国提供了渗入非洲的大好“机会”，“目前在非洲的心脏发生的那些简直是震撼世界的事件，恰恰向我们提供了这样一个机会——只要我们敢想敢做地抓住这个机会。”
    肯尼迪提出了通过联合国控制非洲的六点计划，以提供“剩余粮食”和“开放资本”来进行经济渗透。
    四、对于古巴，这两个总统候选人同样是穷凶极恶的。尼克松露骨地说，美国政府要用“推翻前危地马拉总统阿斯本”的手法。
    肯尼迪叫嚷，美国对古巴实行“贸易禁运”还是“不够”的，美国要争取“西半球的其他国家和欧洲盟国支持美国对古巴的禁运”，美国要没收古巴在美国的资产，并且“加强”所谓“有希望推翻卡斯特罗政权”的古巴反革命势力。
    五、在对中国问题上，尼克松和肯尼迪都竭力表白，将继续奉行敌视中国人民的政策，反对承认中国，阻挠在联合国内恢复我国合法席位，并且公然以中国的领土台湾、金门、马祖问题，作为他们竞选的手段。肯尼迪曾重弹杜勒斯玩弄战争边缘政策失败以后提出过的，“以金马换台澎”的计划，明目张胆地推行“两个中国”的阴谋；而尼克松则露骨地叫嚣美国要直接以武力侵占金门马祖。但是，不管是谁，都同样地为的永久霸占我国领土台湾。
    从两党候选人的这些言论中，以及从两党发表的竞选纲领中，人们可以很清楚的看出，在推行侵略政策和战争政策方面，在敌视苏联、中国和社会主义阵营方面，在推行新的殖民主义方面，美国共和党和民主党没有任何区别，他们都同样力图加剧国际紧张局势。
    三
      在国内问题上，美国在勉强挨过了1957年—1958年的经济危机以后不久，新的经济危机的阴影又笼罩着整个美国。美国经济的三个重要支柱——钢铁、汽车和建筑工业，自从今年第三季度以来生产不断下降。不久前美国政府公布的9月份美国工业生产指数已下降到今年以来的最低点——一○七（以1957年平均数为一百）。在农业方面，“剩余农产品”滞销、农产品价格下降，农民收入减少，大批农民流入城市。美国一直保持着一支庞大的失业队伍，失业人数达四百万人之多。这是1957—1958年经济危机结束以来未曾有过的现象。屋漏偏碰连阴雨，最近在资本主义世界市场上又发生了抢购黄金的风潮，使得美元危机尖锐化和表面化了。面对这种形势，在这次总统竞选中，经济问题自然而然地成为一个重要问题。
    肯尼迪利用他在野党的有利地位，猛烈攻击共和党政府的经济政策。他在10月27日发表的演讲里说，美国显然正在进入“六年来的第三次衰退”。他说，“我们是经不起另一次衰退的”。他指出，今年头九个月，美国经济下降了，而且“比任何（西方）大国都下降得多”。他还指责在共和党执政八年后，钢铁开工率只占生产力的54％，他说“已经到了承认美国目前存在钢铁危机的时候了。”他还抨击尼克松忽视美国
  “有五百万人失业，三百万人半失业。”尼克松在不得不承认美国遇到“某些困难”的同时，却还在打肿脸充胖子，吹嘘什么美国是“最富饶”的国家。尼克松把资本主义世界市场上抢购黄金的责任，推在肯尼迪身上，说形成这一风潮的“主要因素”是肯尼迪对美国“财政和货币政策作了不周的建议，因而引起普遍的耽心”。他认为肯尼迪宣布要将联邦预算在一年中增加一百五十亿美元的计划，对美国经济将带来灾难性的后果。
    至于怎样才能找到出路呢？肯尼迪早在7月10日就提出，增拨二十五亿到三十亿美元，避免今冬可能发生的经济衰退。肯尼迪强调要“保持”美元价值，“恢复支付平衡”，并要求美国“盟国”“分担”美国在世界实行军事侵略和经济扩张的“经济负担”。尼克松则向选民们保证，他们的美元是“保险”的，如果他当了总统，将“保障”美元的价值。在农业政策上，肯尼迪提出一项所谓“在供应管理方面积极的政策”，以提高产品价格和农民收入。尼克松则一方面表示他同艾森豪威尔政府的农业政策无关，另方面提出了扩大农产品用途、防止“剩余农产品”堆积的计划。肯尼迪还开出一张空头支票，他说，如果他当选为总统，将致力实现“八千二百万人就业”，并把最低工资从每小时一美元增加到一点二五美元。尼克松不甘落后，就提出每小时增加一点一五美元。
    尼克松和肯尼迪的确开了一大堆空头支票，只不过是为了骗取选票。但是他们对美国经济情况的日益恶化，却提不出什么有效措施，实际上都把他们的赌注押在保持“冷战”、加紧扩军备战上面。但是，连美国资产阶级报纸和经济学家也不能不承认，不论美国政策采取什么措施，都无法逃脱一场新的“严重的经济衰退”。“下届总统——不论共和党人或民主党人——都将继承一个严重的衰退。”
    四
    美国垄断组织从来把美国总统这个“宝座”看成自己的一个主要工具。因此，不管什么人，没有垄断资本作为后台老板，休想登上白宫的“宝座”。所以，每一届总统候选人，都是由垄断资本家及其代理人在幕后决定的。而在这一届总统的竞选中，值得注意的是，垄断资本集团的代表人物，已经不安于幕后的地位，要直接出面来控制国家机器。民主党的候选人肯尼迪本人就是波士顿的金融豪富的子弟。他的父亲和许多强有力的财团有着联系。1952年，肯尼迪当选为参议员。在这次选举后，大力吹捧肯尼迪的波士顿“邮报”从老肯尼迪那里获得了五十万美元的贷款。而现在的共和党总统候选人尼克松，最初就是由加利福尼亚州美洲银行安插到政界去的。1952年，他又在加利福尼亚财团和华尔街财阀的扶植下，当选为副总统。现在，摩根集团又成了尼克松的主要后台老板。
    对于美国总统的选举，美国垄断资本集团早已一切都安排好了，现在就只待选民去“选择”。而这种“选择”的“权利”，当然不是所有适龄的美国公民都可以“享受”的。法新社说：美国有一千万黑人适合投票年龄，但最多只能有三四百万人运用他们的权利。原因是，南部各州白种人的“敌对态度”，将使许多黑人“弃权”。几百万工人由于谋生而经常迁移，不能在一个城市固定居住下来，因而也将被剥夺选举权。美国人民对于总统选举是一点不感到兴趣的。到了10月下旬，尼克松和肯尼迪的争吵早已白热化了，但据美联社10月25日报道：美国选民“对任何一个候选人都大大缺乏热心”。这是无足为怪的，因为，美国人民知道，不管是民主党胜利、肯尼迪当选，还是共和党继续执政、尼克松当选，都是一丘之貉。他们都将继续执行侵略政策和战争政策，也就是艾森豪威尔政府的现行政策。关于这一点，甚至两党的候选人都坦率承认。尼克松说：“……如果有两个原则完全不同的政党存在，那是非常危险的，因为这样一来政权由一党手中转入另一党手中，就意味着会发生根本的变化。”肯尼迪则说：在同苏联打交道时，“并没有什么民主党的办法或共和党的办法”。 民主党副总统候选人约翰逊也声称：“必须清楚表明，美国在对付共产主义时并无分歧”。
    这就是美国两党制的真谛。（附图片）
