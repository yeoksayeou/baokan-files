Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th: Kennedy, newly elected as the next President of the United States, has immediately begun implementing his plan for further military expansion and war preparations even before taking office.

    Yesterday, he met with former Air Force Secretary Symington, a fervent advocate of military expansion and war preparations, at Palm Beach, Florida, to discuss US military issues. According to Symington's subsequent disclosure, the focus of the meeting was on "reorganizing" the US Department of Defense to make the Pentagon more suitable for the needs of atomic warfare. He said he hoped to prepare a report on this issue for Kennedy's consideration within the month.

    The day before, Kennedy appointed Paul Nitze as his liaison to Paul-Henri Spaak, Secretary-General of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Nitze is scheduled to meet with Spaak in Washington on the 22nd to discuss how to implement the US government's "Ten-Year (Military Expansion) Plan" for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, proposed last December. Nitze, former head of policy formulation at the State Department in the Truman administration, like Symington, has been a fervent advocate of the "Cold War" and "Hot War" and is also a military advisor to Kennedy.

    Kennedy published an article in the American magazine "Missiles and Rockets" last month, discussing some of his plans to intensify military expansion and war preparations after taking office. In this article, Kennedy openly clamored that in January of next year, he would submit the following specific requests to Congress: "Accelerate our 'Polaris,' 'Minuteman,' and other strategic missile programs"; "Expand and modernize our conventional forces, giving them the capabilities and mobility they need"; "Harden and disperse bases, use airborne alert, and improve our air defense systems" to further strengthen "retaliatory power"; and update so-called "defense" facilities to adapt to the needs of warfare in the nuclear-space age. He also said that the United States "must make a greater effort in anti-submarine warfare," "must develop space warning systems and anti-missile weapon systems," and "must encourage and develop basic (military) research on the basis of long-term budget plans."

    In discussing the issue of "reorganizing" the Department of Defense, Kennedy pointed out that he had appointed an advisory committee headed by Symington to study whether the following points were feasible: establishing a "Strategic Command" with "the strength and flexibility to conduct major wars"; a "Tactical Command" with "the strength and mobility to rapidly conduct small-scale wars"; a "Continental Defense Command"; a "Materiel Command"; and a "Development Work Command." He stated that the United States must have "modernized" military facilities "to cope with the atomic age."

    In order to realize his plan to intensify military expansion and war preparations, Kennedy advocated greatly increasing military spending. He emphasized that US military spending must be based on the so-called "national security needs" rather than on a pre-determined budget.

    Kennedy also vigorously advocated intensifying the "strategic space race" with the Soviet Union. He indicated that this was to realize America's ambition to dominate the world. He said, "We cannot be second in this important race," and "must be first." He admitted that "the United States has been failing in the strategic space race with Russia."

    肯尼迪加紧准备推行扩军备战计划
    鼓吹不以预算为根据大大增加军事开支
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：肯尼迪刚当选美国下届总统还没有上台，就立即着手推行他的进一步扩军备战的计划。
    他昨天在佛罗里达州的棕榈海滩会见了扩军备战的狂热鼓吹者、前空军部长薛明顿，同他讨论了美国的军事问题。据薛明顿在事后透露，这次会谈的重点是关于“改组”美国国防部的问题，目的为了使五角大楼更适于进行原子战争的需要。他说，他希望在本月内就这个问题拟好一份报告，供肯尼迪考虑。
    在前一天，肯尼迪任命了保罗·尼采为他同侵略性的北大西洋公约集团的秘书长斯巴克的联络员。尼采即将在22日同斯巴克在华盛顿举行会谈，讨论如何贯彻美国政府在去年12月提出的北大西洋公约集团的“十年（扩军）计划”。尼采是前杜鲁门政府的国务院制订政策的负责人，他同薛明顿一样，一直是“冷战”和“热战”的狂热鼓吹者，也是肯尼迪的军事问题顾问。
    肯尼迪在上月份曾经在美国的“导弹和火箭”杂志上发表了一篇文章，谈到了他在上台后加紧扩军备战的一些做法。肯尼迪在这篇文章中公然叫嚷在明年1月份，他将向国会提出如下的具体要求：“加速我们的‘北极星’式、‘民兵’式和其他战略导弹计划”；“扩充我们的常规部队并使之现代化，使他们得到他们所需要的各种能力和机动性”；“加固基地和分散基地、使用空中警戒和改进我们的防空系统”，以进一步加强“报复力量”；刷新所谓“防务”设施，以便适应核空间时代进行战争的需要。他还说，另外美国“必须在反潜艇战方面作更大努力”，“必须发展空间警报系统和反导弹武器系统”，“必须在长期预算计划的基础上鼓励和发展基本（军事）研究”。
    在谈到“改组”国防部的问题时，肯尼迪指出，他已经任命一个以薛明顿为首的谘询委员会来研究下面各点是否切实可行，即建立一个具有进行“大战的力量和灵活性”的“战略司令部”；一个具有能够迅速进行“小规模战争的力量和机动性的战术司令部”；一个“大陆防御司令部”；一个“物资司令部”；一个“发展工作司令部”。他表示美国必须有“现代化的”军事设施“来应付原子时代”。
    为了实现他的加紧扩军备战计划，肯尼迪鼓吹大大增加军事开支。他强调说，美国的军事开支必须以所谓“国家的安全需要”而不是以事先限定的预算为根据。
    肯尼迪还大力鼓吹要加紧同苏联进行“战略性的空间竞赛”。他表明，这是为了要实现美国称霸世界的野心。他说，“在这场重要的竞赛中，我们不能跑第二”，而“必须跑第一”。他承认，“在同俄国进行战略性空间竞赛方面美国一直在遭到失败”。
