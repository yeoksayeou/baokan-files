Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 10th: The work of harvesting sugar beets and potatoes in Czechoslovakia's rural areas is nearing completion, and autumn ploughing and sowing are now in full swing.

Currently, 97% of sugar beets and over 94% of potatoes have been harvested throughout Czechoslovakia. According to local newspapers, this year's sugar beet harvest has greatly exceeded the original planned output, reaching 307.9 quintals per hectare.

During the sugar beet and potato harvest, urban residents throughout Czechoslovakia enthusiastically supported the rural areas, helping to solve the labor shortage in harvesting. During the peak of the autumn harvest, approximately 200,000 to 300,000 urban residents nationwide went to the countryside to participate in the harvesting work. Local armies and factories also dispatched thousands of trucks to help with transportation.

Autumn ploughing and sowing are also proceeding rapidly. To date, over 60% of the autumn ploughed fields nationwide have been cultivated, and it is expected that the national autumn ploughing work will be completed by the end of November.

This year, autumn ploughing is being carried out in two shifts, day and night, throughout Czechoslovakia. The Ministry of Agriculture organized a socialist competition in autumn ploughing, calling on agricultural laborers to cultivate 180 hectares of land with each tractor in forty days. Socialist Labor Hero, legless tractor driver Skhenir and his companion Laupa cultivated 120 hectares of land in seven days and nights.

This year, Czechoslovakia plans to sow 720,000 hectares of wheat, 500,000 hectares of rye, 150,000 hectares of fodder, and 70,000 hectares of barley. Currently, the sowing of rye has been completed in various regions, and the wheat sowing plan has been completed by 86.4%.

In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest next year, in addition to timely autumn sowing this year, high-yielding wheat varieties cultivated in the country have been used in large wheat fields, which are expected to increase production by five quintals per hectare. At the same time, fertilizer has been applied to the land for crops such as corn, sugar beets, and potatoes, accumulating 10 million tons of fertilizer, and preparations have been made to use chemical drugs to remove weeds on 500,000 hectares of land. The agricultural machinery needed next year is also being manufactured at an accelerated pace. Among them, there are about 17,000 tractors, 24,000 trailers, 2,100 grain harvesting combines, and 1,400 sugar beet harvesting combines.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 11th: Czechoslovak medical circles have recently created a large number of new instruments and equipment, many of which are of world-class level, and some are the best in the world. These devices have played a significant role in Czechoslovakia's medical undertakings.

Czechoslovakia is currently able to produce 1,600 kinds of high-standard medical devices and approximately 2,300 kinds of medical instruments. Before the war, domestically produced medical devices and instruments could only meet 10% of the country's needs, but now it has increased to 90%.

Czechoslovakia produces about twenty kinds of world-class X-ray equipment.

The "artificial heart" produced in Czechoslovakia is already being used in the eleven Czechoslovak hospitals that can perform heart surgery. Czechoslovakia has also trial-manufactured a new device—a cardiac defibrillator. It can use high voltage to restore the function of the heart when it stops working due to fibrillation, and restore blood circulation. Using this device within eight minutes of a patient's heart stopping can save the patient's life. (Attached picture)

    捷克斯洛伐克全面展开秋耕秋播
    甜菜收成超过原订计划　城市居民参加收获工作
    新华社布拉格10日电　捷克斯洛伐克全国农村收获甜菜、马铃薯的工作即将完成，秋耕、秋播工作正在全面展开。
    目前，全捷克斯洛伐克已经收获了97％的甜菜和94％以上的马铃薯。据此间报纸报道，今年甜菜的收成大大超过了原定产量，达到每公顷三百零七点九公担。
    在收获甜菜和马铃薯期间，捷克斯洛伐克各地城市居民热情地支援了农村，帮助农村解决收获中劳动力不足的问题。在秋收高潮期间，全国各地大约有二十万到三十万城市居民下乡参加收获工作。各地军队和工厂企业还派了数千辆卡车，下乡帮助运输。
    秋耕秋播工作也在迅速进行中。到目前为止，全国60％以上的秋耕田已经耕作完毕，预计到11月底全国就可以完成秋耕工作。
    今年，捷克斯洛伐克各地的秋耕工作是分两班日夜进行的。政府农业部在秋耕工作中组织了社会主义竞赛，号召农业劳动者用每台拖拉机在四十天内耕地一百八十公顷。社会主义劳动英雄、无脚拖拉机手斯赫尼尔和他的同伴劳帕在七天的日夜班内，就耕作了一百二十公顷的土地。
    今年，捷克斯洛伐克计划播种七十二万公顷小麦，五十万公顷黑麦，十五万公顷饲料，七万公顷大麦。目前，各地已完成了黑麦的播种工作，小麦的播种计划已经完成了86.4％。
    为了争取明年农业丰收，今年，除了及时进行秋播外，各地还在大片小麦田里采用了本国培育的高产小麦品种，每公顷预计可增产五公担。同时，在种植玉蜀黍、甜菜、马铃薯等作物的土地上施了一次肥，积肥一千万吨，并为在五十万公顷，土地上用化学药品除杂草作了准备。明年所需要的农业机械，也在加紧制造中。其中，有拖拉机一万七千台左右，拖车二万四千辆，谷物收割联合机二千一百台，甜菜收割联合机一千四百台。
    据新华社布拉格11日电　捷克斯洛伐克医学界最近大量创制了各种新的器械和仪器，其中有不少是具有世界水平的，有一些是世界上最好的。这些器械在捷克斯洛伐克医疗事业中起了很大的作用。
    捷克斯洛伐克目前已能生产一千六百种高标准的医学器械和大约两千三百种医疗仪器。本国生产的医疗器械和仪器在战前只能满足本国需要的10％，而现在已增加到90％。
    捷克斯洛伐克生产约二十种达到世界水平的X光设备。
    捷克斯洛伐克本国生产的“人工心脏”，已经在可以施行心脏手术的十一所捷克斯洛伐克医院中使用。捷克斯洛伐克还试制成了一种最新器械——心脏除颤器。它可以在心脏由于颤动而停止起作用时利用高电压来恢复心脏的机能，重新恢复血液循环。在病人心脏停止作用的八分钟内使用这种器械，可以挽回病人的生命。（附图片）
