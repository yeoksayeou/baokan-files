    Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company's Red Flag Competition Concentrates Efforts to Tackle Key Points to Ensure High Yield.
    Production Continues to Rise Steadily and Comprehensively, Steel Output Increases, Iron Consumption and Coke Ratio Decrease
    *Editor's Note:* Closely integrating with current production and continuously developing in depth are two important hallmarks of a well-conducted socialist labor competition. Only by achieving these two points can we better achieve the goal of promoting production development. The Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company's Party Committee regards the scientific analysis of production as the soul of the competition movement, frequently organizing the masses to analyze current production, constantly exploring new critical production problems, and then organizing the masses to carry out key problem tackling and flag-grabbing competitions around these critical production problems. In this way, the competition is always closely integrated with current production, and it constantly has fresh and specific content, deepening and improving step by step, promoting the continuous and comprehensive leap forward in steel production. This experience is worth promoting widely.

    This newspaper reports A vigorous Red Flag competition movement is being carried out in depth at the Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company. Its characteristic is: organizing competition based on the needs of production development and on the basis of mass scientific analysis of production; wherever a critical production point appears, the spearhead of the Red Flag competition points there, and technological innovation and technological revolution follow. Therefore, this kind of competition always has fresh and specific content, inspiring the broad masses of workers to continuously engage in revolution, and promoting the continuous and steady comprehensive rise in production. Since the comprehensive launch of this competition movement in August, the company's steel and iron output has been rising steadily. In October, compared with September, steel output increased by 14%, and iron increased by 2.3%; iron consumption per ton of steel decreased by 2.14%, and the coke ratio for ironmaking decreased by 2.49%. The qualified rates for both steel and iron are above 99%.

    In the past it was comparing dead data, now it is
  "Living Competition"

    The Red Flag competition movement at Shijingshan Iron & Steel Company developed on the basis of mass key problem tackling battles. The first to launch this competition was the converter steelmaking experimental plant.

    Since the beginning of this year, the steel output of the steelmaking experimental plant has continuously reached new peaks. However, in the previous stage, output often fluctuated, unable to rise steadily. Why? Under the leadership of the plant's Party Committee, the workers specifically analyzed the reasons for the high and low yields of several furnaces of steel, and found that in the process of high-speed growth of steel output, the various production conditions changed extremely rapidly. Whether they could promptly grasp the key problems in the process of changing production conditions and solve them in a timely manner was the decisive factor in each formation of high or low yield. Therefore, they carefully analyzed the various specific factors affecting the stable rise in steel output, and found a total of ninety-six critical problems, listing them as competition projects and organizing workers to carry out a "key problem tackling competition"; whoever tackled one of these key problems would have a red flag drawn for him on the competition board. They gave this competition a name, calling it the "Hundred Red Flags Competition."

    This competition method greatly pleased the masses. First, these ninety-six problems involved the work of all the plant's workers, and everyone could participate. Second, it was different from past competition methods. In the past, it was just indicators plus measures, competing on a few fixed data. As production developed and contradictions transformed, competing on these few data was not enough. Now it was a "living competition," competing on solving the new problems that constantly arose in production's leap forward. It was specific and practical. As soon as this competition unfolded, a vibrant scene appeared throughout the plant, and the mass movement to encircle and attack key problems reached an unprecedented climax. In just half a month, more than ninety key problems were basically solved, and steel output increased sharply by 17% compared with the first half of the month.

    One flag is raised high, and ten thousand flags flutter. The experience of the experimental plant was quickly promoted throughout the company. From production departments to auxiliary departments, from various functional management sections to hospitals and cafeterias, each unit and each worker, based on the needs of production and work development, and in response to the critical problems that urgently needed to be solved, set out the goals of striving for flags and tackling key problems. As long as people made certain efforts, they could get a red flag. The competition was boiling in every corner of the company, and almost everyone was swept into the tide of competition. Many people became "key problem tackling fanatics" and "innovation fanatics."

    To hit the key point in the competition, it is necessary to
  conduct scientific analysis of production

    In the heated competition, a noteworthy problem appeared in the No. 3 blast furnace: more than thirty red flags were densely posted on the competition board, but the production level had not increased much. What was going on? In order to find out the truth, the Party Secretary of the ironmaking plant took cadres and technicians to the No. 3 blast furnace to find the reason with the Party小组. They found in laboring with the workers that the operation of the third shift was not uniform; analyzing from the statistical data, the No. 3 blast furnace had been losing the stockline — the furnace was short of material, and the blast furnace could not be filled, of course, it could not produce more iron. They turned around and talked with the workers. The workers all said: "If the workers of our third shift do not unify the operation, the problem of losing the stockline will never be solved." Before this, people took it for granted that the slow increase in production level was due to too much coke fines, the large size of the sintered ore ... Because there was no specific analysis, although a lot of effort was spent, the problem could not be solved. This time, after analysis, the key was found, and everyone worked together to improve the operation, and "planted" the competition red flag on improving the operation. In less than a week, the problem of losing the stockline was solved. The blast furnace production level rose steadily, and the average daily output in the last ten days increased by 22% compared with the first ten days.

    The experience of No. 3 blast furnace gave people an important inspiration: Where the flag of the Red Flag competition is planted is the core issue of the competition. It embodies the Party's centralized leadership over the competition movement. The key to solving this problem lies in conducting scientific analysis of production. Without a specific analysis of the production situation, the red flag cannot be planted on the key problems that can best mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and promote production, and the competition may not hit the key point. Although it is also lively, it is like the jade apple in the antique shop, which looks good but cannot be eaten.

    From then on, a new rule was established for the Red Flag competition movement: competition projects set casually do not count, and the red flag must be planted on the critical production problems after analysis. In this way, the work of conscientiously conducting scientific analysis of production became the soul of the competition movement. Before each production organization determined the Red Flag competition project, some organized workers to speak freely, widely exposing the contradictions in production; some organized workers to compare with the advanced indicators of others, studying their own weak links; some cadres "dissected sparrows" and conducted typical investigations; some cadres and workers and technicians were "three combinations" and observed and experimented on the spot ... On the basis of conducting scientific analysis of production, all armies attacked key problems and grabbed flags, production potential was continuously explored, and the competition movement went a step further.

    Concentrate on attacking targets, small red flags
  ensure big red flags

    The movement is developing, and all departments are leaping forward. However, for a period of time, the leap forward of each department was not fully reflected in the most important indicator — the high yield of steel. Someone said: It's better to stretch out your fingers and squeeze them into a fist! How much the workers hoped that the output of steel could quickly and comprehensively reflect the results of their hard work. At this time, the company's Party Committee, based on a comprehensive analysis of the current production situation, issued the leap forward indicators of daily steel and iron output to all workers. It also stipulates that units that achieve these two indicators and related measures within a week can get a "big red flag."

    The two major indicators are like two bright lights, hanging high in the hearts of the workers. Everyone linked their own battle goals with the company's production tasks, and everyone used "small red flags" to ensure "big red flags," concentrating their soaring efforts on the goal of high steel output. Each blast furnace, each work section and team, equipment maintenance workers, cleaning workers, and laboratory staff of the ironmaking plant, around the general goal of high pig iron output, set out the specific indicators and measures of their unit as the "small red flag" of their unit to ensure the "big red flag." In order to ensure the high output of the blast furnace, the maintenance workshop regarded the absence of any equipment accidents within a week as the red flag of the workshop, and the elimination of a equipment defect as a red flag of the team. The workers were like alert sentries, holding tools and flashlights, climbing up and down, inspecting the equipment day and night, not letting go of a screw or a switch. The charging workers of No. 3 blast furnace regarded ensuring that the blast furnace was full and not losing the stockline as their competition red flag. In order to ensure sufficient raw material supply, each class, according to the situation that many bin eyes of the material warehouse were blocked, regarded opening a bin eye as a team red flag. Ignoring the flying dust and the high heat emitted by the sintered ore, the workers of Team B seized every gap in loading and charging to open six bin eyes with large iron rods, and got six red flags. The workers of Team C vigorously pursued as soon as they went to work, and as a result, opened fourteen bin eyes and got fourteen red flags. The twenty bin eyes that had been blocked for a long time were all opened in just one day in such a hot competition.

    In this way, the whole company ensured one level after another, concentrating its firepower and fiercely attacking the general goal of high steel and iron output. On the third day, the daily steel output exceeded the "big red flag" indicator, and the qualified rate reached 99%; on the fourth day, the daily iron output also exceeded the "big red flag" indicator, and the qualified rate reached 100%.

    Continuously advance to new weak links, continue to climb to peaks steadily

    The production level of steel and iron has risen, and the output of coke, sintered ore and limestone, which are closely related to it, has a gap with the peak of steel and iron output. The old balance was broken, and the "front, back, left and right" of steel and iron production became weak links. In order to stabilize and improve the high output level of steel and iron, the "big red flag" was "planted" in all the logistics departments around steel and iron production.

    The workers in the logistics departments rushed towards the peak of steel production. Sintering workers adopted new technologies, so that the sintering machine cart utilization coefficient quickly increased to more than 2.6, reaching the national advanced level, and the proportion of sintered ore used in blast furnace increased from 74% to 77%; coking workers fiercely attacked the mud and coal flotation checkpoint, improved the recovery rate of refined coal, and coke output increased by 10.9%; transport workers carried out technological revolution around the mechanization of loading and unloading, shortened the time railway vehicles stayed in the factory by 13%, creating good conditions for the timely supply of materials needed for high steel output.

    While maintaining and continuing to improve the high output level of steel and iron, the steelmaking and ironmaking workers also conscientiously compared and analyzed various indicators, and launched a powerful offensive to the weak links in the comprehensive leap forward. Blast furnace workers planted the red flag on reducing the coke ratio, striving to improve wind temperature and improve the utilization of blast furnace gas; converter workers adopted new technologies to reduce spatter loss and compete for the red flag to reduce iron consumption ....

    The Red Flag competition movement of this company is developing continuously and deeply, and the company's production is constantly climbing to new peaks of high yield, high quality and low consumption.

    哪里出现生产关键问题　竞赛的矛头就指向哪里　技术革命就跟到哪里
    石钢红旗竞赛集中力量攻要害保高产
    生产持续稳定地全面上升，钢铁产量增长铁耗焦比下降
    编者按：紧密结合当前生产，持续深入发展，是社会主义劳动竞赛开展得好的两个重要标志。作到了这两条，才能更好地达到促进生产发展的目的。石钢党委把对生产的科学分析作为竞赛运动的灵魂，经常组织群众分析当前生产，不断发掘新的生产关键问题，然后组织群众围绕生产关键问题开展攻关夺旗竞赛。这样就使竞赛始终同当前生产结合得很紧密，而且经常具有新鲜具体的内容，步步深入，步步提高，促进了钢铁生产持续全面跃进。这一经验值得广泛推广。
    本报讯　一个朝气勃勃的红旗竞赛运动，正在石景山钢铁公司深入开展。它的特点是：在群众性的对生产进行科学分析的基础上，根据生产发展的需要组织竞赛；哪里出现生产关键，红旗竞赛的矛头就指向哪里，技术革新和技术革命也就跟踪到哪里。因此，这种竞赛永远具有新鲜具体的内容，激励着广大职工不断革命，促使生产持续稳定地全面上升。自从8月份全面开展这一竞赛运动以来，全公司钢、铁的产量节节上升。10月份同9月份比较，钢产量提高了14％，铁提高2.3％；每吨钢的铁耗降低2.14％，炼铁焦比降低2.49％。钢和铁的合格率都在99％以上。
    过去是比死数据，现在是
  “活竞赛”
    石钢的红旗竞赛运动是在群众性攻关战役的基础上发展起来的。首先开展这一竞赛的是转炉炼钢试验厂。
    今年以来，炼钢试验厂的钢产量不断出现新的高峰。但是前一阶段产量常忽上忽下，不能稳定地上升。为什么呢？在工厂党委会的领导下，职工们具体分析了若干炉钢的高产和低产的原因，发现在钢产量高速度增长的过程中，生产的各种条件变化极快，能否及时抓住生产条件变化过程中的关键问题，并及时解决，是每次形成高产或低产的决定性因素。于是，他们周密分析了影响钢产量稳定上升的各种具体因素，一共找出了九十六个关键问题，把它们列为竞赛项目，组织职工开展“攻关赛”；谁攻下其中一个关键，就在竞赛牌上给他画一面红旗。他们给这种竞赛起了个名字，叫做“百面红旗竞赛”。
    这个赛法很合群众的“胃口”。第一、这九十六个问题，涉及全厂所有职工的工作，人人都可以参加。第二，它和过去的赛法不同，过去只是指标加措施，赛的是几条固定的数据，生产发展了，矛盾转化了，比这几条数据就不够了；现在是“活竞赛”，赛的是解决生产跃进中不断出现的新问题，它赛的具体，赛的实在。这个竞赛一展开，全厂就出现了生气蓬勃的景象，围攻关键的群众运动达到了前所未有的高潮。仅仅半个月时间，九十多个关键问题都基本上解决了，钢产量较前半个月猛增17％。
    一旗高举万旗飘。试验厂的经验迅速在全公司推广开来，从生产部门到辅助部门，从各个职能管理科室到医院、食堂，每个单位，每个职工，都根据生产和工作发展的需要，针对当前急待解决的关键问题，订出了夺旗攻关的奋战目标。人们只要经过一定的努力，都可以得到红旗。竞赛在全公司各个角落沸腾着，几乎所有的人都卷入了竞赛的热潮。许多人成了“攻关迷” ，“革新迷”。
      竞赛要打中要害，就要
  对生产进行科学分析
    在火热的竞赛中，三高炉出现了一个引人注意的问题：竞赛牌上的红旗密密麻麻地贴了三十多面，但是生产水平并没有上去很多。这是怎么回事呢？为了弄清真相，炼铁厂党委书记带着干部和技术人员到三高炉去，和党小组一起找原因。他们在同工人一起劳动中，发现三班的操作不统一；再从统计资料中分析，三高炉一直亏料线——炉子缺料，高炉填不饱肚子，当然不能多产生铁。他们又回过头来同工人一起座谈。工人们都说：“咱们三班工人不把操作统一了，亏料线的问题一辈子也解决不了。”在这以前，人们却想当然地认为，生产水平上去的不快，是焦炭末子多，烧结矿块度大……。由于没有进行具体的分析，虽然花了很大力气，还是解决不了问题。这回经过分析，关键找出来了，大家合力改进操作，把竞赛红旗“插”在改进操作上，不到一星期，就把亏料线的问题解决了。高炉生产水平稳定上升，后十天的平均日产量比前十天提高了22％。
    三高炉的经验给人们一个重要的启示：红旗竞赛的旗究竟插在什么地方，是竞赛的核心问题。它体现着党对竞赛运动的集中领导。解决这个问题的关键，在于对生产进行科学分析。没有对生产情况的具体分析，红旗就不能插在最能调动群众积极性和促进生产的关键问题上，竞赛就可能打不中要害，虽然也热热闹闹，可就像古玩店里的翡翠苹果一样，好看不能吃。
    从此，红旗竞赛运动立了一个新规矩：随随便便订的竞赛项目不算数，红旗必须插在经过分析的生产关键问题上。这样，认真对生产进行科学分析的工作，成了竞赛运动的灵魂。各级生产组织每次确定红旗竞赛项目以前，有的组织职工大鸣大放，广泛揭露生产中的矛盾；有的组织职工对照别人的先进指标，研究自己的薄弱环节；有的干部“解剖麻雀”，进行典型调查；有的干部和工人、技术人员“三结合”，在现场观测、试验……。在对生产进行科学分析的基础上，各路大军攻关夺旗，生产潜力不断被发掘出来，竞赛运动深入了一步。
      集中攻击目标，小红旗
  保大红旗
    运动在发展着，各个部门都在跃进。可是，有一段时间，各部门的跃进并没有完全体现在最主要的指标——钢铁的高产上面。有人说：手指伸开了，捏成拳头才好哩！工人们多么希望钢铁的产量能够迅速地全面反映出他们奋战的成果啊。正在这个时候，公司党委根据对当前生产情况的综合分析，向全体职工下达了钢、铁日产量的跃进指标。并且规定凡在一周内实现了这两项指标和有关措施的单位，都可以得到“大红旗”。
    两大指标像两盏明灯，高悬在职工们的心头。每个人都把自己的奋战目标，和全公司的生产任务联系了起来，大家纷纷用“小红旗”保“大红旗”，把冲天的干劲都集中到钢铁高产的目标上。炼铁厂的每座高炉，每个工段、小组，设备维修工人，清扫工人，化验室的工作人员，围绕着生铁高产的总目标，都订出了本单位的具体指标和措施，作为本单位保“大红旗”的“小红旗”。维修车间为了保证高炉高产，把一周内设备不出任何事故作为车间红旗，把消灭一个设备缺陷作为小组的一面红旗。工人们像机警的哨兵一样，拿着工具和手电筒，登上爬下，日夜巡视检查设备，一个螺丝，一个开关也不放过。三高炉的上料工人把保证高炉吃饱不亏料作为自己的竞赛红旗。各个班为了保证原料供应充足，根据料仓许多仓眼被堵塞的情况，把每通开一个仓眼，算一面小组红旗。乙班工人不顾飞扬的灰尘和烧结矿发出的高热，抓紧每一次装车上料的空隙时间，用大铁棍通开了六个仓眼，得了六面红旗。丙班工人一上班就猛力追赶，结果通开了十四个仓眼，得了十四面红旗。长期被堵塞的二十个仓眼，在这样热火朝天的竞赛中，仅一天时间就全部通开了。
    全公司就这样一层保一层，集中火力，猛攻钢、铁高产的总目标。第三天，钢的日产量就超过了“大红旗”指标，合格率达到99％；第四天，铁的日产量也超过了“大红旗”指标，合格率达到100％。
      不断向新的薄弱环节进
  军，持续稳定地攀登高峰
    钢铁的生产水平上升了，与它密切相联的焦炭、烧结矿和石灰石等的产量，同钢铁产量的高峰有了距离。旧的平衡被打破，钢、铁生产的“前后左右”成了薄弱环节。为了稳定和提高钢铁的高产水平，“大红旗”又“插”到围绕钢、铁生产的各个后勤部门。
    后勤部门的职工一齐朝着钢铁生产的高峰猛赶。烧结工人采用新技术，使烧结机台车利用系数迅速提高到二点六以上，达到全国先进水平，高炉配用烧结矿的比例由74％上升到77％；炼焦工人猛攻泥煤浮选关，提高精煤回收率，焦炭产量提高了10.9％；运输工人围绕装卸机械化开展技术革命，使铁路车辆在厂停留时间缩短13％，为及时供应钢铁高产所需物资创造了良好的条件。
    炼钢、炼铁工人在保持和继续提高钢铁高产水平的同时，也认真对比分析各项指标，向全面跃进中的薄弱环节展开了强大的攻势。高炉工人把红旗插在降低焦比上，努力提高风温，改善高炉煤气的利用；转炉工人采用新技术，减少喷溅损失，争夺降低铁耗的红旗……。
    这个公司的红旗竞赛运动持续深入地向前发展着，全公司的生产不断地攀上高产、优质、低耗的新高峰。
