Whatever Steel Enterprises Need is Given Production Priority
Changchun Machinery Workers Rush to Produce Spare Parts and Accessories

    (Our report) According to the Jilin Daily: Over twenty machinery factories in Changchun City are actively rushing to produce equipment and spare parts for steel production. To date, they have produced 95 electric arc steelmaking furnaces, 4,041 pieces of various spare parts needed for steel production (1,089 tons), and 100,295 KVA of electrical equipment. This equipment and spare parts have been successively transported to Anshan Iron and Steel, Baotou Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel and other key steel enterprises across the country and within the province, strongly supporting steel production and the construction of the steel industry.
    Since the launch of the increased production and economy movement centered on grain and steel, the machinery factories in Changchun City immediately launched a production competition focused on guaranteeing key products to support agriculture and steel. The broad masses of workers put forward the slogan "Whatever steel production needs, we will give priority to producing it," and placed the production tasks of steel equipment and spare parts in the most important position. In order to produce the water pumps needed for steel production as soon as possible, the Pumping Factory took the initiative to replace materials with those from their inventory before the materials allocated by the state arrived, and rushed to produce 204 water pumps, ensuring the needs of national construction. In the production of electric arc steelmaking furnaces, the Electric Furnace Factory focused on product matching. Departments, processes, shifts, and individuals throughout the factory launched a "Thousand Minutes per Day" movement centered on guaranteeing key products, rapidly increasing production capacity. Not only did they meet the needs of electric furnace matching, but ten individuals and one group had already stepped into 1961 three months ahead of schedule. From January to October, this factory produced 95 electric furnaces for the state, exceeding the annual state plan by 33.3%, and the total output of electric furnaces increased by 51% compared with the whole year of 1959.
    In the rush to produce steel equipment and spare parts, some medium and small-sized machinery factories are also actively rushing to produce large-scale smelting equipment for the steel industry. The 17 types of industrial pumps produced by the Pumping Factory for steel enterprises include five new products. When trial-producing acid-resistant pumps, they lacked acid-resistant alloys. The factory leaders mobilized the workers to vigorously engage in technical innovation and technical revolution. Through the three-in-one combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers, they manufactured an acid-resistant alloy smelting furnace and self-made acid-resistant alloys.
    In order to complete the production tasks of steel equipment and spare parts as soon as possible, the factories undertaking the manufacturing tasks have actively carried out hook-up cooperation between factories according to their own production capacity, and actively guaranteed the production of key products. In order to complete the manufacturing tasks of the 350 rolling mill and 42-hole coking equipment with good quality and quantity on schedule, the Xingdong Machinery Factory actively cooperated with fraternal factories. They asked the Municipal Machinery Factory to cast steel castings for rolling mills, and asked the Automobile Factory to help with mechanical processing. Some nodular cast iron parts were also successfully resolved with the cooperation of the Instrument Factory, ensuring the completion of key products on schedule and ahead of schedule.

    钢铁企业需要什么就优先生产什么
    长春机械职工赶制备品配件
    本报讯　据吉林日报消息：长春市二十多个机械工厂，积极为钢铁生产赶制设备和备品配件。到目前为止，已经生产出电弧炼钢炉九十五台、钢铁生产所需要的各种备品配件四千零四十一台件（一千零八十九吨），电器设备十万零二千九百五十千伏安。这些设备和备品配件已经陆续运给鞍钢、包钢、武钢等全国和省内的重点钢铁企业，有力地支援了钢铁生产和钢铁工业的建设。
    以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动开展以后，长春市各机械工厂立即掀起了一个以保证重点产品支援农业，支援钢铁的生产竞赛。广大职工提出“钢铁生产需要什么，我们就优先生产什么”的口号，都把钢铁设备和备品配件的生产任务排在首要地位。制泵厂为了尽快地把钢铁生产所需要的水泵生产出来，在国家调拨材料还没有进厂前，就主动地用库存的材料代替，优先赶制了二百零四台水泵，保证了国家建设的需要。电炉厂在制造电弧炼钢炉生产中，大抓产品配套，全厂部门与部门、工序与工序、班与班、个人与个人之间开展了以保证重点产品为中心的“日产千分钟”运动，迅速提高了生产能力，不但满足了电炉配套的需要，并且有十个人和一个小组已经提前三个月跨进了1961年。这个厂1至10月已经为国家生产了九十五台电炉，超额33.3％完成了全年国家计划，比1959年全年电炉总产量增长了51％。
    在赶制钢铁设备和备品配件中，一些中、小型机械工厂也都积极为钢铁工业赶制大型冶炼设备。制泵厂为钢铁企业生产的十七种工业泵，其中有五种是新产品。他们在试制耐酸泵时没有耐酸合金，厂领导发动职工大闹技术革新和技术革命，通过领导干部、技术人员和工人三结合的办法，制造了一台耐酸合金冶炼炉，自制耐酸合金。
    为了尽快地完成钢铁设备和备品配件的生产任务，承担制造任务的各厂都根据本厂的生产能力，主动地开展了厂与厂之间的挂钩协作，积极保证重点产品生产。兴东机械厂为了如质如量如期完成三五○轧钢机和四十二孔焦化设备的制造任务，积极和各兄弟厂协作，请市机械厂给浇注轧钢机的铸钢件，请汽车厂帮助搞机械加工，一些球墨铸铁的部件，由于得到仪器厂的协作，也都顺利地得到了解决，保证了重点产品按期和提前完成。
