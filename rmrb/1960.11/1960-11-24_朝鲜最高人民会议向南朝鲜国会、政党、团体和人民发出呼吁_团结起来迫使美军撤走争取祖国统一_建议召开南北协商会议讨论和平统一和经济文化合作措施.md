Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 22nd: To realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued "Letter from the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the National Assembly, Political Parties, Social Organizations, and People of the Republic of Korea" to South Korea. Attached to the letter is an "Opinion on Realizing Economic and Cultural Exchanges Between North and South Korea and Seeking the Autonomous Development of South Korean National Economy."

The letter states that the division of the fatherland into North and South has lasted for fifteen years. During these long years, flesh-and-blood relatives between our North and South cannot meet, and any economic and cultural exchanges have been cut off. For our nation, which has always shared joys and sorrows and experienced internal and external troubles together throughout its long history, this is indeed an unbearable and heavy pain. Especially the bleak situation formed in South Korea today makes the issue of a unified country an urgent and pressing requirement.

The letter says that you, unable to endure the long-accumulated anger and extremely miserable life under unprecedented tyranny and poverty, finally rose up to launch a heroic struggle and drove away the traitor Syngman Rhee. Your struggle is a just and patriotic struggle, but all that you have gained from the precious blood you shed is just a change of government, and the situation has not changed in any way. On the contrary, the unmanageable political chaos, financial and economic crisis, and social unrest are intensifying day by day.

The broad masses of workers, farmers, youth, and students can no longer endure this increasingly dark and suffocating reality. They hold demonstrations, strikes, and class boycotts, and continue to carry out fierce struggles. But the current South Korean rulers describe the just struggles of the people as "disturbances" and painstakingly seek excuses for suppression. They put aside the people's livelihood problems and only fight for power and profit for their own selfish desires.

The letter emphasizes that no matter who is in power, as long as the US military continues to occupy South Korea and Korea remains divided, it is absolutely impossible to remedy the current situation in South Korea. There is only one way out, and that is: to realize the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and unite the forces of the North and South to revitalize and develop the South Korean economy. However, the current rulers of South Korea only beg for US "aid" and try to deceive the people. The lessons of our history undeniably prove that relying on external forces is the road to national subjugation, and US "aid" has only brought slavery, poverty, and economic bankruptcy to South Korea. Foreign capital invades like a flood, monopolizing the South Korean market, and the national industry and commerce have fallen into the abyss of decline. South Korea, known as the "granary," has even become a chronic famine area, a hell on earth of hunger and poverty, which is precisely the consequence of US "aid."

The letter states that there is only one way to guarantee the country's rejuvenation and national interests, and that is to take control of one's own destiny. Without the autonomy of the national economy, complete political independence cannot be guaranteed; without complete independence, there can be no prosperity for the country and the nation. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has long laid a solid foundation for the national economy in North Korea along the road of autonomous development. We already have enough strength to strengthen and develop the country's economy more rapidly, and if necessary, we can build any economic sector. We earnestly hope that our own precious fruits of labor can be used for the development of the South Korean economy and the improvement of people's lives, and believe that this is the greatest joy and the national obligation that we should fulfill.

The letter emphasizes that the peaceful reunification of the fatherland must be realized autonomously, without any foreign interference, and on a democratic basis through the method of holding free general elections in the North and South. To this end, the US military must first immediately withdraw from South Korea. The general election must be held in an atmosphere of complete freedom that guarantees that the people can freely express their will. Freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association is a matter of course and must be guaranteed. All political parties and social organizations, regardless of their political views, should have complete freedom to publicize their political programs and carry out political activities in any place in North and South Korea. The general election must be a universal, equal, and thoroughly guaranteed secret ballot democratic election. Only in this way can the Korean people have a unified, all-Korean democratic government that represents their true will.

The letter says that the so-called "elections under the supervision of the United Nations" are an intolerable insult to the Korean people's autonomy and national pride. The United Nations has no right or qualification, nor any moral authority, to interfere in the resolution of the Korean issue. The so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" is only a tool to cover up the US imperialist policy of enslavement and division in South Korea, so this organization must be disbanded immediately.

The letter says that if the South Korean authorities still cannot accept free North-South general elections, then even transitional measures should be taken to restore the severed ties between the same nation and unite the divided national forces to open up a path toward final unification. We propose the implementation of a North-South Korean federation as such a measure. Temporarily retain the existing political systems of North and South Korea as they are, and maintain the independent activities of the two governments, while a supreme national committee is composed of representatives of the two governments.

The letter further says that if the South Korean authorities cannot even accept the implementation of a federation, we once again suggest that representatives of the business community in North and South Korea establish even a purely economic committee, without involving political issues, to realize economic cooperation and exchange.

The letter says that if economic and cultural cooperation and exchange between the North and South are realized, with the support of the powerful economic strength of North Korea, the South Korean economy, which is in a state of bankruptcy, will be rapidly restored and developed, and the lives of the South Korean people will also be significantly improved in a short period of time.

The letter says that measures should be taken to build schools extensively with state funds, so that all children who have not been able to attend school can enroll, all the homeless orphans in South Korea should be taken in and raised by the state; measures should be taken to protect the lives and property of residents; chronic diseases should be eradicated so that civilians can receive free treatment; the state should invest in large-scale housing construction so that extremely poor residents can rent housing at low prices, and urban construction projects should be promoted; postal services and exchanges between the North and South should be realized, reporters should be sent to each other to conduct free reporting activities; national freight and passenger transport measures should be taken, and all seaports should be opened.

The letter says that in order to solve these urgent problems facing the fatherland and the nation, representatives from North and South Korea should gather together and conduct sincere consultations. A North-South consultation conference should be held rapidly in Panmunjom, Pyongyang, or Seoul.

The letter says, let us unite under the banner of the whole nation's struggle to vigorously eliminate the barriers between the North and South! We must resolutely fight against the US imperialists' tyrannical interference in our internal affairs, their contempt, mistreatment, and humiliation of our nation, and demand the immediate withdrawal of US troops!

The letter concludes by expressing the hope that the members of the South Korean National Assembly and the South Korean authorities will carefully study this proposal and take the necessary measures to implement it quickly.

Attached to the letter is the "Opinion on Realizing Economic and Cultural Exchanges Between North and South Korea and Seeking the Autonomous Development of South Korean National Economy," which is divided into five parts: "On Revitalizing and Developing South Korean Agriculture and Stabilizing the Lives of Farmers," "On Developing South Korean Fisheries and Stabilizing the Lives of Fishermen," "On Developing South Korean National Industry and Vigorously Carrying Out Housing Construction," "On Realizing Economic Cooperation and Trade Between North and South," and "On Realizing Exchanges and Cooperation in Science, Culture, Education, and Health Sectors."

It elaborates in detail on the opinions on restoring and developing the South Korean economy, improving the people's living conditions, and realizing economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea.

    朝鲜最高人民会议向南朝鲜国会、政党、团体和人民发出呼吁
    团结起来迫使美军撤走争取祖国统一
    建议召开南北协商会议讨论和平统一和经济文化合作措施
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议为实现祖国的和平统一，今天向南朝鲜发出了“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议给大韩民国国会、南朝鲜各政党、社会团体和人民的信”。随信并附有一份“关于实现南北朝鲜之间的经济文化交流和谋求南朝鲜民族经济自主发展的意见书”。
    信中说，祖国国土被分割成南北两段已经十五年了。在这漫长的年月里，我国南北之间骨肉之亲不能会面，经济文化等任何交流都被断绝。这对于在整个悠久历史过程中一向同生死共甘苦，共同经历了内忧外患的我们民族来说，的确是无可容忍的沉重痛苦。特别是今天在南朝鲜形成的惨淡局面，使统一国家的问题成了刻不容缓的迫切要求。
    信中说，你们在旷古未闻的暴政和穷困中无法忍耐蓄积已久的愤怒和极度的苦难生活，终于奋起展开英勇的抗争，赶走了卖国贼李承晚。你们的斗争是正义的爱国斗争，但是，你们流下的宝贵鲜血所得到的只是政府的更换而已，情况并没有任何改变。相反的，无法收拾的政治混乱、财政经济危机和社会不安，却日益加剧。
    工人、农民、青年、学生等广大群众，再也不能忍受这种越发黑暗越发窒息的现实，他们举行示威、罢工、罢课，继续进行着激烈的斗争。但是现在的南朝鲜执政者们却把人民群众的正义斗争说成是“骚扰”，苦心寻找镇压的借口。他们把人民的生活问题抛在一边，只为自己的私欲争权夺利。
    信中强调说，不管是谁掌握政权，只要美国军队继续霸占南朝鲜、朝鲜仍然处于分裂状态的话，收拾目前的南朝鲜局面，是绝对不可能的。出路只有一条，那就是：实现祖国的和平统一，联合南北的力量复兴和发展南朝鲜的经济。但是南朝鲜的目前执政者们却只乞求美国的“援助”，力图欺骗人民群众，我国历史的教训不容争辩地证明：依靠外部势力就是亡国的道路，美国的“援助”给南朝鲜带来的只是奴役、贫穷和经济破产。外国资本像洪水一样地侵袭进来，垄断南朝鲜的市场，民族工商业陷进了没落的深渊里；以“谷仓”闻名的南朝鲜甚至变成了慢性的饥馑区，变成了饥饿贫穷的人间地狱，这正是美国“援助”的后果。
    信中说，保障国家的复兴和民族利益的道路只有一条，那就是自己掌握自己的命运。没有民族经济的自主，就不能保证完全的政治独立；没有完全的独立，就不能有国家和民族的繁荣。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，早已沿着自主发展的道路，在北朝鲜打下了民族经济的牢固基础。我们已经有了足够的力量，能够更加迅速地加强和发展国家的经济，必要时也可以新建任何经济部门。我们热烈期望，我们自己的珍贵的劳动结晶能利用于南朝鲜经济的发展和人民生活的改善，并认为这是最大的喜悦和应尽的民族义务。
    信中着重指出，祖国的和平统一，必须自主地、在没有任何外国干涉的情况下，在民主基础上用实行南北自由总选举的方法来实现。为了这样，首先必须使美军立即撤出南朝鲜。总选举必须在保证人民群众能够自由表示自己意志的完全自由的气氛中举行。言论、出版、集会、结社的自由是当然的，必须得到保证。所有政党、社会团体，不管它们的政治见解如何，在南北朝鲜任何一个地方应有宣传自己的政纲、进行政治活动的完全自由。总选举必须是普遍的、平等的、彻底保证秘密投票的民主选举。只有这样，朝鲜人民才能具有代表自己真正意志的、统一的、全朝鲜的民主政府。
    信中说所谓“在联合国监督下的选举”，是对朝鲜人民的自主性和民族自豪感的不可容忍的侮辱。联合国没有任何权利或资格、也没有任何道义上的权威来干预朝鲜问题的解决。所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”只不过是掩盖美帝国主义在南朝鲜的奴役政策和分裂政策的工具，所以必须立即解散这个机构。
    信中说，假如南朝鲜当局还不能接受自由的南北总选举的话，也要采取那怕是过渡性的措施来恢复被断绝了的同一民族之间的联系，联合被分裂的民族力量来开辟走向最后统一的道路。我们建议实行南北朝鲜的联邦制，作为这种措施。暂时照旧保留南北朝鲜的现有政治制度，并保持两个政府的独自活动，同时由两个政府的代表组成最高民族委员会。
    信中进一步说，如果南朝鲜当局连联邦制的实行也不能接受的话，我们再次建议，由南北朝鲜实业界代表成立那怕是纯粹的经济委员会，不牵涉政治问题，以实现经济合作和交流。
    信中说，如果南北之间的经济文化合作和交流得到实现的话，在北朝鲜强大的经济力量的支援下，陷于破产局面的南朝鲜经济将得到迅速的恢复和发展，南朝鲜人民的生活也将在短时间内得到显著的改善。
    信中说，应该采取措施，用国家的资金广泛建设学校，使没有能上学的儿童全部就学，要把南朝鲜的流浪孤儿全部收容起来，由国家抚养；要采取措施，保护居民的生命财产；要根除慢性疾病，使平民受到免费治疗；要由国家投资，大力建设住宅，使赤贫居民能以廉价租用住宅，并推进城市建设工程；要实现南北通邮和来往，要互派记者，进行自由的报道活动；要采取全国范围的货运和客运措施，并开放各海港。
    信中说，为了解决摆在祖国和民族面前的这些迫切的问题，南北朝鲜的代表就要聚集在一堂，真挚地进行协商。在板门店、平壤或汉城，急速召开南北协商会议。
    信中说，让我们在大力排除南北障壁的举族斗争的旗帜下团结起来！要断然为反对美帝国主义者横暴地干涉我国内政、对我们民族的蔑视、贱待及侮辱，要求美军立即撤退而斗争！
    信中最后表示期待南朝鲜国会议员们和南朝鲜当局慎重地研究这个建议，采取必要的措施迅速予以实现。
    附于信中的“关于实现南北朝鲜之间的经济文化交流和谋求南朝鲜民族经济自主发展的意见书”共分
  “关于复兴、发展南朝鲜农业和安定农民的生活”、
  “关于发展南朝鲜渔业和安定渔民生活”、“关于发展南朝鲜的民族工业和大力进行住宅建筑”、“关于实现南北之间经济合作和贸易”和“关于实现科学、文化、教育和保健部门的交流和合作”等五个部分。
    其中详尽地陈述了关于恢复和发展南朝鲜经济，改善人民生活状况，实现南北朝鲜的经济文化交流的意见。
