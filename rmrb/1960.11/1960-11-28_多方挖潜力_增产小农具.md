    Exploit Potential from All Sides, Increase Production of Small Farm Tools
    Yang Yongmao, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Qinxian Agricultural Machinery Factory, Shanxi Province
    Under the call of the Party to vigorously develop agriculture, vigorously develop food production, and for all sectors to support agriculture, the broad masses of workers in our factory have been doing everything possible to tap the potential of the enterprise and increase the production of various small farm tools. This has not only strongly supported agriculture but also promoted the increase production and economize movement within the enterprise.
        If Agriculture Needs It, We Will Do It
    Our factory was originally a machine repair section of the Qinxian United Processing Factory (i.e., the "Wanbaoquan" Factory). Since the Great Leap Forward, it has begun to undertake the manufacturing of some agricultural machinery and simple equipment for community-run industries. The main products produced include gas engines, harvesters, rice transplanters, corn threshers, power waterwheels, small steel grinding mills, rice milling machines, belt machine tools, etc. Although a portion of small farm tools were also produced, they were sometimes not given enough attention because they were not included in the plan.
    This autumn, under the call of the Party to vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop food production, in order to further ensure that the work of supporting agriculture is "targeted," we, under the instructions of the county party committee, organized a group of cadres and technicians led by the secretary and factory director to conduct a relatively detailed survey of various communes, management areas, and production teams. During the survey, we found that this year's agricultural production has a significant characteristic, which is that "with the call of the Party to vigorously develop agriculture and vigorously develop food production deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the labor force on the agricultural front has greatly increased, and the attendance rate of female labor and auxiliary labor has also been unprecedentedly high, resulting in a large increase in the demand for production tools. According to a survey of some production teams in the Guocun and Baijiagou management areas, there is a shortage of about 30% of small farm tools such as shovels, hoes, sickles, and hoes, calculated at one set per labor force. At the same time, some small farm tools that have been damaged after long-term use also urgently need to be repaired. We also interviewed some production team leaders, work group leaders, and old farmers. They said: "The machines and new-style farm tools you make for us are all good things, 'treasures' for improving labor efficiency and doing a good job in agricultural production. However, small farm tools on hand are indispensable." In a word: the production of small farm tools is very important.
    Can we increase the production of some small farm tools to support agricultural production while completing the state product plan and doing a good job in repair and assembly work? After we "revealed" these situations to the workers, most of the workers said: "As long as agriculture needs it, we will do it!" However, some people believe that the production of small farm tools is a matter for the commune farm tool factory, and the agricultural machinery factory should produce agricultural machinery! It is not cost-effective to make small farm tools in a piecemeal fashion, and so on. In response to these incorrect ideas, the party branch led all employees in discussions. Through discussions, the broad masses of workers further established the idea of vigorously supporting agriculture and generally realized that county-run industries are close to rural areas and should do whatever agriculture needs as much as possible. In order to support vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing food production, we should not be greedy for profits and not be afraid of trouble.
              Mechanical Factories Have Great Potential to Manufacture Farm Tools
    Do state-owned mechanical factories like ours have the potential to increase the production of small farm tools? How can the problems of raw materials, equipment, and technical strength be solved?
    We organized all the employees in the factory to calculate the accounts. Everyone believed that we have many favorable conditions for increasing the production of small farm tools. First, we can make full use of the leftover materials, cut ends, and bevels left over from manufacturing agricultural machinery as raw materials. The cut materials left over from manufacturing a gas engine can be used to make six iron shovels or hoes; the cut materials left over from manufacturing a belt machine tool can make thirty sickles. In addition, the steel skin and iron filings from machine tool cutting can also be forged into sickles after being returned to the furnace for sintering... The steel and iron scrap from our factory's cutting and chipping amounts to more than 20,000 kilograms per year. According to the average amount of materials used to manufacture four kinds of small farm tools such as shovels, hoes, sickles, and hoes, a total of more than 12,000 pieces can be produced. Second, the technology for manufacturing small farm tools is easy to learn. More than 40 workers in our factory were originally rural iron, wood, and sand-turning craftsmen. Relying on them to train apprentices, there is no problem with the technical strength to increase the production of small farm tools. Third, the tools and equipment used to produce small farm tools are very simple. In addition to the existing tools, some of the tools that were "retired" during the technical revolution can also be repaired and utilized. Fourth, the man-hours used to produce small farm tools are short, and the production gaps can be used to produce them, which does not conflict with the completion of the state-controlled product production plan.
    By calculating the above accounts, the broad masses of workers have more confidence. Under the premise of ensuring the completion of the state product plan, a upsurge in tapping the internal potential of the enterprise and increasing the production of small farm tools quickly formed.
            Compare Intra-Factory Production, Compete in Supporting Agriculture
    In the activity of increasing the production of small farm tools, we combined striving for intra-factory production increases with supporting agricultural production increases. We used everyone doing good deeds for agriculture and supporting a large increase in food production to promote the increase production and economize movement within the factory, and used the achievements of intra-factory production increases and economizing to support agriculture. Workshops and workshops, groups and groups, people and people, competed fiercely with each other in terms of faster progress, higher output, better quality, more material savings, fuller utilization of waste materials, and greater tapping of potential.
    All the factory employees found tricks and thought of ways to save materials, improve production efficiency, and make more small farm tools in every possible way. For example, the forging workshop used various short materials, sheet materials, and edge materials that could not be used to make "regular" products, and manufactured more than 1,840 sickles, 540 iron shovels, and 1,400 hoes in just over a month. When rushing to make sickles to support the autumn harvest, the workshop originally planned to produce 1,000 in ten days. Driven by the labor competition, 1,100 were produced in seven days.
    Our factory's digging of internal potential and large-scale production of small farm tools not only supplemented the shortcomings of the commune farm tool factory's strength, strongly supported agricultural production, but also promoted the comprehensive utilization of raw materials and materials in our factory, made full use of waste materials, and improved man-hours and equipment utilization, thereby promoting the in-depth development of the factory's increase production and economize movement. In September and October alone, our factory increased the production of more than 8,200 pieces of small farm tools such as shovels, hoes, sickles, and hoes, which supported the urgent needs of the "Three Autumns". The factory also increased the wealth of the country by more than 10,400 yuan, and the production situation of state-controlled products was also good.
    In the future, while completing and overfulfilling the agricultural machinery production plan, we will continue to tap potential, increase the production of more small farm tools, and better meet the diverse needs of rural areas.

    多方挖潜力  增产小农具
    中共山西省沁县农业机械厂支部书记  杨永茂
    我厂广大职工在党的大办农业、大办粮食和各行各业支援农业的号召下，千方百计挖掘企业潜力，增产各种小农具，既有力地支援了农业，又促进了企业内部的增产节约运动。
        农业需要　我们就干
    我厂原是沁县联合加工厂（即“万宝全”工厂）的一个机修工段。大跃进以来，开始担负一部分农业机械和社办工业简易设备的制造任务。生产的产品主要有煤气机、收割机、插秧机、玉米脱粒机、动力水车、小钢磨、碾米机、皮带机床等。小农具虽然也生产一部分，但因不在计划之内，有时就重视不够。
    今年秋季，在党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召下，为了使支援农业的工作进一步做到“有的放矢”，我们根据县委的指示，由书记、厂长带领一批干部和技术工人，深入到各个公社、管理区和生产队进行了一次比较详细的调查。在调查中，我们发现今年的农业生产有一个显著的特点，这就是“随着党的大办农业、大办粮食的号召深入人心，农业战线上的劳动力大大增加，妇女劳力和辅助劳动力的出勤率也空前提高，生产工具需要量大增。据郭村和白家沟管理区部分生产队的调查，锨、镢、镰、锄等四种小农具，按每个劳动力一套计算，缺少30％左右；同时，有一部分经过长时间使用损坏了的小农具也急需修复。我们还访问了一些生产队长、作业组长和老农，他们说：“你们给我们造的机器和新式农具都是好家伙，是提高劳动效率搞好农业生产的‘宝贝’。可是，手头小农具，离了一样也不行。”一句话：小农具的生产很重要。
    我们能不能在完成国家产品计划和搞好修配工作的同时，增产一部分小农具来支援农业生产呢？我们把这些情况向工人群众“交底”以后，大部分职工说：“只要农业需要，我们就干！”可是，也有少部分人认为：生产小农具是公社农具厂的事，农业机械厂就应该生产农业机械！造小农具零零星星不合算，等等。针对这些不正确的思想，党支部领导全体职工开展了讨论。通过讨论，广大职工进一步树立了大力支援农业的思想，普遍认识到县营工业接近农村，应该农业需要什么，就尽可能地干什么。为了支援大办农业，大办粮食，应该不贪图利润，不怕麻烦。
              机械厂造农具潜力很大
    像我们这样的地方国营机械厂，增产小农具有没有潜力呢？原料、设备、技术力量问题怎样解决呢？
    我们组织全厂职工算账。大家都认为：我们增产小农具有许多有利条件。第一，可以充分利用制造农业机械剩下的边料、裁头、斜角等下脚料当原料。制造一部煤气机剩下的截料，就可以制造六把铁锨或镢头；制造一部皮带机床剩余的截料，能造三十把镰刀。此外，机床切屑的钢皮、铁屑，经过回炉烧结，也可以打成镰刀……。我们全厂裁剪和切屑下的钢、铁废料，每年约有两万多公斤，按制造锨、镢、镰、锄等四种小农具的平均用料数量计算，共可生产一万二千多件。第二，制造小农具的技术容易学，我厂工人中又有四十多个人原是农村的铁、木、翻砂工匠，依靠他们带徒弟，增产小农具的技术力量不成问题。第三，生产小农具用的工具设备很简单，除现有的工具外，在技术革命运动中“退伍”的一部分工具也可以修复利用。第四，生产小农具用的工时少，可以利用生产空隙时间，同完成国家控制的产品生产计划没有矛盾。
    通过算以上几笔账，广大职工信心更足。在保证完成国家产品计划的前提下，大挖企业内部潜力，增产小农具的热潮很快形成。
            比厂内增产　赛支援农业
    在增产小农具的活动中，我们把争取厂内增产同支援农业增产结合起来。以人人为农业办好事，支援粮食大增产来推动厂内的增产节约运动，用厂内增产节约的成绩来支援农业。全厂车间与车间，组与组、人与人之间，以比进度快、比产量高、比质量好、比用料省、比充分利用废料、比挖潜力为内容，展开了热烈的竞赛。
    全厂职工人人找窍门，个个想办法，千方百计节约用料，提高生产效率，多造小农具。例如，锻工车间利用各种不能制做“正规”产品的短料、片料、边料等，在一个多月内就制造镰刀一千八百四十多把，铁锨五百四十张，镢头一千四百把。在支援秋收赶制镰刀时，这个车间原计划在十天内生产一千张，在劳动竞赛的推动下，七天就生产了一千一百张。
    我厂挖掘内部潜力，大造小农具，既补充了公社农具厂力量不足之处，有力地支援了农业生产，又促进了本厂原料材料的综合利用，充分利用了废料，提高了工时和设备利用率，从而推动了全厂增产节约运动的深入开展。仅9、10两个月，我们厂就增产锨、镢、镰、锄等各种小农具八千二百多件，支援了“三秋”的急需。全厂还为国家增产财富一万零四百多元，国家控制产品的生产情况也好。
    今后，我们要在完成和超额完成农业机械生产计划的同时，继续挖掘潜力，增产更多的小农具，更好地满足农村多方面的需要。
