Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 31st. Representatives of African national movements in Cairo, on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian war of independence, condemned imperialist aggression against Algeria and expressed their support for the just struggle of the Algerian people.

    Okelo, director of the Kenyan National Movement's office in Cairo, condemned the United States for providing weapons to French imperialism, which has consistently massacred the Algerian people. He called on all peace-loving countries, especially Asian and African countries, to do everything possible to help the Algerian people in their struggle to end French rule in Algeria.

    Amani Thani, director of the Zanzibar National Movement's office in Cairo, said that the struggle of Algeria is one of the strongest spears thrust into the chest of imperialism in Africa. He said that De Gaulle had tried to deceive world opinion with so-called methods of seeking a solution to the Algerian question, but world opinion had exposed his conspiracy. Amani Thani demanded the organization of an African army to support Algeria's struggle against French imperialism.

    Ossende Afana, representative of Cameroon to the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, said that the battle of Algeria is the battle of all African people and all peace-loving and freedom-loving people. He said that the Cameroonian people firmly support the Algerian people and condemn French crimes in Algeria.

    The director of the South African United Front office in Cairo said that no force in the world can make Africa submit to imperialist rule. He added that, thanks to the support of the Asian and African people, the struggles of Algeria, South Africa, the Congo, and other African countries bullied by imperialism will surely end in victory. He called on Asian and African countries to take rapid economic and diplomatic measures to assist the Algerian people's struggle.

    Asaad Raji, Secretary-General of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, also issued a statement today, praising the heroism of the Algerian people who are fighting for freedom and independence.

    He said, "Our brothers have been fighting a difficult battle for six years against about one million French soldiers equipped with NATO weapons, but the Algerian people will be victorious."
