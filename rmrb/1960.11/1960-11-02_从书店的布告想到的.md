From the Bookstore's Notice

Zhang Zilai

The Xi'an Zhonglou Branch of Xinhua Bookstore posted several notices:

    "Provisional Measures for the Recycling of Key Books by This Bookstore";
    "Provisional Measures for the Rental of Books by This Bookstore";
    "Provisional Measures for Lending Books and Materials by This Bookstore";
    "This Bookstore Will Transcribe Pinyin Annotations for Readers";
    "This Bookstore Has Established a Reading Room".

After reading these notices, I was deeply moved by the spirit of the comrades at this bookstore, who are doing everything possible to serve the readers.

Serving the people wholeheartedly is a hallmark of the people of the Mao Zedong era. People in all walks of life see it as their duty to find ways to better serve the collective. Look! The comrades at this bookstore branch not only sell books, but also rent and lend them. And that's not all, they've even established a reading room for people to read in, and they transcribe Pinyin annotations for readers. They treat "extra" tasks as "essential" tasks, and they do their best to do them well. This noble communist style has now become a common practice in our society.

In the face of these notices, I think each of us should learn from the spirit of the comrades at Xinhua Bookstore, and find ways to serve "everyone" better and better in our own jobs. The so-called "better and better" is not only to do a good job of "essential" work, but also to do a good job of "extra" work, as long as it is beneficial to the masses.

### 从书店的布告想到的

    从书店的布告想到的
    张紫来
    新华书店西安市钟楼门市部，贴了这么几张布告：
    “本部开展重点书籍回收业务暂行办法”；
    “本部开展出租图书暂行办法”；
    “本部开展出借图书资料暂行办法”；
    “本部代替读者拼写汉字注音”；
    “本部成立阅览室”。
    看了这几张布告，这个书店的同志千方百计为读者服务的精神，使我深受感动。
    全心全意为人民服务，这是毛泽东时代的人们的特色。各行各业的人们，都把如何为集体服务得更好，作为自己份内的事。你看！这个书店门市部的同志，不仅卖书，而且租书、借书；这都不说，还成立了阅览室，供人们看书，并且代替读者拼写汉字注音等。他们把“额外”的事当作“本份”的事去做，而且尽力做好；这种崇高的共产主义风格，如今已经成了我们社会普遍的风尚。
    在这几张布告面前，我想我们每个人都应该学习新华书店同志们的精神，怎样在自己的工作岗位上千方百计地“为人人”服务得好些再好些。所谓“好些再好些”当然不仅是做好“份内”的工作，而且要做好“额外”的工作，只要是对群众有益的。
