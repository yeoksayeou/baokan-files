    Doing a good job of grain distribution and procurement, the most important thing is to do a good job of weighing and warehousing. This is the main link in grain work. ... After weighing and warehousing, grain output is clarified, inventory figures are verified, and there is a solid basis for correctly implementing the grain distribution policy; after weighing and warehousing, the grain purchased by the state is controlled by the state, and the grain collectively owned by the rural areas is jointly controlled by the basic accounting units and grain-using units, so that it can be processed, stored, and used in a more planned way, and the grain of the whole society can be managed better.

    With Output Clearly in Mind, Procurement, Seeds, Rations, and Fodder Are Quickly Implemented
    Taizhou Vigorously Grasps Grain Weighing and Warehousing
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to Xinhua Daily News: The Party committees at all levels in Taizhou County, Jiangsu Province, in the mass movement of delivering and selling procured grain, seized the important link of weighing and accounting, achieved a clear understanding of output, arranged one crop after another, and enabled the procurement of grain, seed grain, ration grain, and fodder grain to be quickly implemented in all four aspects. As of the 8th, the county had completed 93.6% of its annual grain procurement task.
    Under the leadership of the county party committee, the communes of Taizhou County began preparing for this year's grain distribution before the autumn grain was harvested. They conducted full ideological mobilization among the masses, carried out careful yield estimations, and submitted this year's grain distribution policy to the masses for full discussion, and formulated grain distribution plans in accordance with the policy. Because the plan fully took into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, it mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses to do a good job in autumn harvesting and planting. At the same time, based on past experience, party committees at all levels recognized that the key to doing a good job in this autumn's grain work was to correctly grasp grain output, so they all vigorously grasped the work of weighing, accounting, and warehousing.
    Four levels of cadres throughout the county converged at the fields, contracting by area and field, focusing on weighing and accounting to accelerate the progress of harvesting, threshing, and warehousing. They ate, lived, worked, and discussed with the commune members in the fields, ensuring that political work reached the fields, meetings and meals reached the fields, and work evaluation and score recording reached the fields. With the help of cadres, all localities improved the grain management system of collecting and managing as you go, so that weighing and accounting numbers were implemented. In each field, the county established a system of five members and one leader through democratic elections, so that each link of harvesting, transporting, threshing, turning, winnowing, weighing, warehousing, and management established a professional team and responsibility system in a streamlined manner, and accordingly established management organizations with party members, members of the Communist Youth League, poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and activists as the core, so that weighing and accounting were not chaotic at all.
    Because they grasped weighing and accounting tightly, they promoted the rapid completion of the procurement task. Louzhuang Commune weighed and accounted on one side, and delivered and sold on the other. Within seven days, it mobilized more than 1,000 people and 300 boats to rush the delivery of grain, and completed the annual grain procurement task at once. The county's grain department also actively organized forces to help weigh grain in the fields, purchase on-site, transport it immediately, and put it into storage immediately.
    In the process of harvesting, threshing, weighing, and warehousing, party committees at all levels mobilized the masses to harvest quickly, thresh quickly, dry quickly, winnow quickly, weigh quickly, and warehouse quickly, and at the same time educated the masses to cherish grain and love the fruits of labor, so as to achieve high yields and good harvests. After the grain was put into storage, all localities promptly improved the system of unified management of grain income and expenditure by the brigade, so that income and expenditure had vouchers, stored grain had accounts, and grain use had plans.
    After grain weighing and accounting, party committees at all levels have a clear understanding of the situation and can timely arrange seed grain, feed grain, and rations for the masses, and help the masses arrange grain use plans, so that the procurement of grain, seed grain, ration grain, and fodder grain are implemented in all four aspects. Now the whole county is stepping up the finishing work of autumn harvesting and conducting inspections of grain warehousing. (Attached photo)

A large number of rice grains are being packaged for shipment.

    做好粮食的分配和收购，最重要的是搞好过秤入仓工作。这是粮食工作的主要环节。……经过过秤入仓，粮食的产量弄清楚了，库存数字核实了，就有了确实的根据，能够正确地贯彻粮食分配政策；经过过秤入仓，国家收购的粮食由国家掌握起来，农村集体所有的粮食由基本核算单位和用粮单位共同掌握起来，就能够更有计划地加工、保管和使用，把全社会的粮食管理得更好。

    全县四级干部会师场头，分片分场包干，以过秤入账为中心，加快收割脱粒和入仓入库的进度。他们都在田头场头和社员同吃同住同劳动同商量，做到政治工作到田，开会吃饭到田，评工记分到田。在干部帮助之下，各地都健全了随收随管的管粮制度，做到过秤入账，数字落实。全县每个场头都通过民主选举，建立了五员一长负责制，使收割、运送、脱粒、翻晒、扬净、过秤、入仓、管理各个环节，建立了一条龙的专业队伍和责任制度，并相应建立了以党团员和贫农、下中农积极分子为核心的管理组织，因而做到过秤入账丝毫不乱。
    由于抓紧过秤入账，从而促进了征购任务的迅速完成。娄庄公社一面过秤入账，一面交售，在七天之内，出动一千多人三百条船突击送粮，一下子就完成了全年粮食征购任务。县粮食部门也积极组织力量，帮助就场过秤，现场收购，随购随运，立即入库。
    在收割脱粒过秤入仓过程中，各级党委一面发动群众快割快打快晒快扬快过秤快入仓，一面教育群众珍惜粮食，爱护劳动果实，做到丰产丰收。在粮食入仓以后，各地都及时健全了大队统一管理粮食收支等各项制度，做到收支有凭证，存粮有账册，用粮有计划。
