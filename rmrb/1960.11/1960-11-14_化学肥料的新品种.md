    New Varieties of Chemical Fertilizers
    Nitrogen-Fixing Blue-Green Algae
    Since 1958, the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been experimenting with a type of lower plant that grows on the surface of water or in moist soil – nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae. Observations over the past two years have shown that applying nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae in rice paddies has a significant yield-increasing effect. Only five catties of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae are needed per mu of rice paddy, and it can reproduce to about one thousand catties in a year, fixing nitrogen (i.e., fertilizer effect) equivalent to about ninety to one hundred catties of ammonium sulfate. Rice treated with nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae has an increased number of grains and grain weight, fewer empty husks, and a yield that is 3%-10% higher than control fields without nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae. The cost of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae is very low, about two jiao five fen per catty of wet weight. This year, Hubei Province has listed it as one of the three major key fertilizers along with pig manure and green manure, and is vigorously promoting it. The current problem is the mass cultivation of nitrogen-fixing blue-green algae strains. If not handled well, it is easy to produce miscellaneous algae, i.e., cultivating green algae or other blue-green algae that do not fix nitrogen. The Institute of Hydrobiology is currently studying simplified cultivation methods. At present, specialized institutions can centrally cultivate and produce dry strains, which are distributed to various places for use.
    Industrial Wastewater
    Petroleum industrial wastewater contains a large amount of nitrogen fertilizer. Fushun farmers have been using petroleum industrial wastewater to irrigate rice paddies for more than twenty years, but the yield has been unstable. When used properly, the yield can reach more than a thousand catties, but improper use can cause lodging, prolonged growth, and rice blast, resulting in reduced yields. Based on summarizing the experience of the masses, the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has identified the key to preventing lodging, prolonged growth, and rice blast over the past two years, which is to control the amount of industrial wastewater used and the content of harmful components in it. They comprehensively analyzed the water quality and composition of Fushun industrial wastewater, determined the required amount of wastewater with different nitrogen content for different soils, and established a rapid, accurate, and simple method for analyzing wastewater. Using this method, water release personnel can analyze the components of wastewater within ten to twenty minutes, know the content of nitrogen and harmful substances in it, and thus can adjust the amount of wastewater used at any time, so that the rice fields always maintain appropriate fertilizer and control the content of harmful substances. Last year, after the Lishizhai Commune in Fushun adopted this method on its 11,300 mu of rice paddies irrigated with petroleum wastewater, lodging, prolonged growth, and rice blast were greatly reduced. The yield was half higher than the control fields that did not use petroleum wastewater but used fifty catties of ammonium sulfate per mu. Continued experiments this year have completely eliminated the above three problems. Although there was excessive rainfall this year, the estimated yield is still very high. There is a lot of industrial wastewater in various parts of our country. According to estimates by relevant experts, if the industrial wastewater in Fushun alone can be fully utilized, it can increase grain production by hundreds of millions of catties each year, and can save a large amount of ammonium sulfate.
    Trace Elements
    Plants need many kinds of trace elements during their growth and development. Some of these elements, such as boron, manganese, zinc, copper, molybdenum, cobalt, iron, etc., are needed by plants in very small amounts, and are called trace elements. Elements needed in large amounts, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are called macro-elements or major elements. The Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Northwest Institute of Biology and Soil Science, and the Beijing Institute of Plant Physiology have all conducted research experiments in recent years using trace elements as fertilizers to treat crops, and have achieved significant yield increases. There are three methods of treatment: spraying a solution of trace elements on the leaves of crops; soaking seeds in a solution; applying the solution to the soil around the roots.
    Since 1954, the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science has been studying the treatment of crops such as soybeans, wheat, cotton, and sugar beets with trace elements such as molybdenum, boron, manganese, zinc, and copper. After five years of experiments, it has been proven that they all have varying degrees of effect, among which molybdenum has the greatest effect on soybeans, which can increase yield by more than 15% and can advance the maturity period of soybeans by three to five days. The application rate is only a few grams per mu, and the cost per gram is only a few fen.
    Research experiments by the Northwest Institute of Biology and Soil Science have proven that boron has the most obvious yield-increasing effect on wheat. The results of their experiments in Guanzhong, eastern, and western Shaanxi are: the average yield per mu of boron-treated fields was 18.4%-22.1% higher than that of control fields without boron. The Beijing Institute of Plant Physiology sprayed manganese sulfate on rice leaves, resulting in an average yield increase of 29.2%. They sprayed zinc sulfate on grape leaves, increasing yield by 15%; applying molybdic acid and ferrous sulfate can increase yield by 19%.

    化学肥料的新品种
    固氮兰藻
    中国科学院水生生物研究所，自1958年以来，就试验一种生长在水面或湿土上的低等植物——固氮兰藻。两年来的观察证明：在水稻田里施用固氮兰藻，有显著的增产效果。每亩水稻只需放五斤固氮兰藻，一年后就可繁殖到一千斤左右，固定的氮素（即肥效）大约相当于九十到一百斤硫酸铵。施用固氮兰藻的水稻，粒数和粒重都增加，空壳减少，产量比不施固氮兰藻对照田要高3％—10％。固氮兰藻成本很低，每斤湿重约值二角五分，今年湖北省已把它和猪粪、绿肥并列为三大重点肥料，大力推广。现在存在的问题是固氮兰藻的藻种大量培养问题。掌握得不好，容易产生杂藻，即培养出来的是绿藻或其他不固氮的兰藻。现在水生生物研究所正在研究简化培养方法。目前可以由专门的机构集中培养，制出干燥的菌种，分送各地使用。
    工业废水
    石油工业废水中含有大量氮肥。抚顺农民利用石油工业废水灌溉水稻田已有二十多年历史，但产量一直不稳定，用得好，产量可达到千斤以上，使用不当，就会引起倒伏、贪青和稻热病，造成减产。中国科学院林业土壤研究所两年来在总结群众经验的基础上，找出了防止倒伏、贪青和稻热病的关键，即掌握工业废水的用量和控制其中有害成分的含量。他们全面分析了抚顺工业废水的水质和成份，确定了不同土地对不同含氮量的废水的需要量，并且建立了一种分析废水的快速、准确、简单的方法。放水员应用这种方法可在十分钟到二十分钟之内分析出废水成份，知道其中氮素和有害物质的含量，从而可以随时调节废水用量，使稻田中经常保持合适的肥分，并控制有害物质的含量。去年，抚顺李石寨公社在用石油废水灌溉的一万一千三百亩水稻田上采用这个方法后，大大减少了倒伏、贪青和稻热病，比不施石油废水而每亩施用五十斤硫铵的对照田的产量高一半，今年继续实验，完全没有发生上述三个弊病，虽然今年由于雨水过多，但估产的产量仍很高。我国各地工业废水很多，据有关专家估算，仅抚顺一地的工业废水，如能充分利用，每年就可增产粮食以亿斤计，而且可节省大量硫铵。
    微量元素
    植物在生长发育过程中，需要许多种微量元素。其中一部分元素如硼、锰、锌、铜、钼、钴、铁等，植物对它们的需要量极微，称之为微量元素。需要量大的元素如氮、磷、钾，就称为大量元素或常量元素。中国科学院林业土壤研究所、西北生物土壤研究所和北京植物生理研究室等单位，近几年来都进行了用微量元素作为肥料来处理农作物的研究实验，都获得显著的增产效果。处理的方法，有下列三种：把微量元素的溶液喷洒在作物的叶子上；用溶液浸种子；把溶液施在根部土壤中。
    林业土壤研究所从1954年起研究用钼、硼、锰、锌、铜等微量元素处理大豆、小麦、棉花和甜菜等作物。经过五年的实验，证明都有不同程度的作用，其中尤以钼对大豆的作用最大，可提高产量15％以上，并可使大豆成熟期提前三到五天。施用量每亩仅需数克，每克成本仅几分钱。
    西北生物土壤研究所的研究实验证明，硼对小麦的增产效果最明显。他们在陕西关中、东部、西部实验的结果是：施硼的平均亩产比不施硼的对照田增产18.4％—22.1％。北京植物生理研究室用硫酸锰喷洒在水稻叶面上，平均增产29.2％。他们用硫酸锌喷洒在葡萄叶面上，增产15％；施用钼酸和硫酸铁都能增产19％。
