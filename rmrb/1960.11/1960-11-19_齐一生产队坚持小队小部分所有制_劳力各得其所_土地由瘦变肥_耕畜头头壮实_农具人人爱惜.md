Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 18th: The Qi Yi Production Team of Fengqiao Commune, Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, has persisted for three years in fixing labor, land, draft animals, and farm tools for use by production teams. This has fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the production teams and commune members, resulting in increased production year after year.

With people settled and hearts at ease, the drive is doubled. This is the common reflection of the commune members after the labor force was fixed to the team. Everyone believes that only with fixed labor can the team scientifically use the labor force. For example, the Third Team has a total of thirty-three full and half laborers. They divided them into three operation groups according to their strength and technical skill, with the team leader and deputy team leader concurrently serving as operation group leaders. During the busy farming season, they concentrated their efforts on agricultural production. When it was not the busy season, in addition to focusing on agricultural production with the main force, they also engaged in diversified operations based on the principle of using talent according to aptitude. Some cultivated tea gardens and mulberry fields, some burned lime, some fished, some collected wild plants, and some engaged in sideline production, giving full play to the role of each commune member. This not only completed the contracted production tasks every year, but also increased the income of the commune members.

Because of the imbalance of labor and land between the teams, and the early and late growth of crops, it is still necessary to organize labor cooperation. In organizing labor cooperation, they adhered to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and equal exchange, and adopted the method of "fixed in the middle, cooperation at both ends," that is, organizing cooperation at the beginning and end of harvesting and planting, and each team independently harvesting and planting during the peak season. This is conducive to fixing the labor force and giving play to the role of cooperation.

Fixed land cultivation encourages commune members to improve the soil in every possible way. In order to improve the soil, each team raises more pigs and accumulates more manure; cuts green grass and uses green manure to fertilize the fields; and digs ditches and repairs dikes to improve the drought resistance of some rain-fed fields. After nearly three years of effort, the whole team has transformed the consistently low-yielding Qi Yi Slope into a high-yielding slope. Fixed land also facilitates the team to plant according to local conditions. For example, every winter when planting, the Fourth Team arranges crops according to the soil, for example: planting broad beans in sandy fields, barley in dry fields, wheat in good fields, grass seeds in relatively low-lying and wet fields, and vegetables in nursery fields.

This production team has twenty-one head of cattle. They are distributed to the teams for fixed use and breeding according to the amount of land and the strength of the cattle. Zhang Xiaochuan, the leader of the Third Team, in order to raise the cattle well, not only often educates the herdsmen to pay attention to feeding, but also pays attention to not letting the cattle become too tired when using them. The two cattle in this team were originally relatively thin, but now they are very strong.

Because farm tools are fixed, the commune members cherish them very much. Now each team has a farm tool custodian, and has established a farm tool registration book and registration card, so that every farm tool has a record and every item has a place.

Because this production team has insisted on implementing the "four fixings" for three years, and has conscientiously implemented the Party's other policies, the team's rice production has increased year after year, and animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries have also developed. The whole team completes the state plan every year, most teams exceed the contracted production every season, and at present, every household of commune members has surplus grain, and two hundred and twenty of the three hundred and four households have savings.

    齐一生产队坚持小队小部分所有制
    劳力各得其所　土地由瘦变肥
    耕畜头头壮实　农具人人爱惜
    本报杭州18日电　浙江诸暨县枫桥公社齐一生产队，三年来坚持把劳力、土地、耕畜、农具固定给生产小队使用，充分调动了生产小队和社员的积极性，生产年年提高。
    人定心定，干劲倍增。这是劳力固定到小队后，社员们普遍的反映。大家认为只有劳力固定，小队才可能把劳动力科学地加以使用。例如第三小队共有三十三个整半劳动力，他们根据劳力强弱、技术高低，划分了三个操作小组，由正副小队长兼任操作组长。在农忙的时候，就集中力量搞好农业生产；不是大忙时候，除了以主要力量搞农业生产以外，还根据因才使用的原则，大搞多种经营，有的培育茶园、桑园，有的烧石灰，有的捕鱼，有的采集野生植物，有的从事副业生产，充分发挥了每一个社员的作用。这样不仅年年完成包产任务，而且增加了社员的收入。
    由于小队与小队之间的劳力、土地不平衡，作物生长有早有迟，所以还有必要组织劳力协作。在组织劳力协作中，他们坚持了自愿两利、等价交换的原则，同时采取了
  “中间固定、两头协作”的办法，即：在收种开始和收种末期，组织协作；进入收种旺季时，各小队自行收种。这样做既有利于固定劳力，又能发挥协作作用。
    土地固定种植，促使社员千方百计改良土壤。各小队为了改良土壤，多养猪、多积栏肥；割青草，用青草肥田；挖沟修堰，提高一部分靠天田的抗旱能力。经过近三年来的努力，全队已使一贯低产的齐一坂变为高产坂。土地固定，还便于小队因地种植。第四小队每年冬种的时候，都根据土壤安排作物，例如：沙滩田种蚕豌豆，高燥田种大麦，好地种小麦，比较低湿的田里种草子，秧田种蔬菜。
    这个生产队有二十一头耕牛，他们根据小队土地多少、牛力强弱等情况，分给小队固定使用、繁殖。第三小队队长张小传为了养好耕牛，除了经常教育牧童注意喂养以外，在使用时还注意不让耕牛过于疲劳。这个小队的两头耕牛原来都比较瘦，现在都很健壮。
    由于农具固定使用，社员们对于农具都很爱护。现在每个小队都有一个农具保管员，并且制订了农具登记册和登记卡，做到样样农具有登记，件件农具有着落。
    这个生产队由于三年来坚持实行了“四固定”，再加上认真执行了党的其他各项政策，全队的水稻连年增产，畜牧业、副业、渔业等也有了发展。全队年年完成国家计划，大多数小队季季超包产，目前户户社员有余粮，三百零四户中二百二十户有存款。（附图片）
