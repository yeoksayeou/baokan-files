    Taking on the Responsibility of Feeding Over Five Hundred People
    Long Fuxing, the general affairs manager of the Xinzhoudadui canteen in the Xinzhou Commune of Longlin County, Guangxi, is a cadre transferred from the Baise Prefectural Grain Bureau. This young man in his twenties is working very enthusiastically in the canteen! Every day, he is in charge of the eating and living problems of over five hundred people in the brigade. He has a share in everything: boiling water, chopping firewood, dividing vegetables, and distributing meals.
    In the past, the Xinzhoudadui canteen was not well managed due to poor management. When Long Fuxing was first transferred here, Secretary Mao of the commune Party committee talked to him, saying, "You have worked in grain work before and must be familiar with canteen work. You can take on the responsibility of feeding over five hundred people in the brigade!" Long Fuxing agreed without saying a word. Unexpectedly, on the first day of joining the canteen work, he encountered some difficulties. He thought, "The burden of more than five hundred people is really not easy to bear!" At this time, Secretary Mao discovered this problem and encouraged him, saying: "This burden is indeed not light! However, it is the responsibility of young people to take it up. You should not be afraid of difficulties and go forward courageously." After listening to Secretary Mao's words, he thought of his responsibility and assured the Party that he would run the canteen well! The Party branch also held a special meeting to help him study the existing problems in the canteen. The next day, before dawn, he got up, chopped firewood and made a fire in the dark, calculated the number of people eating, weighed the rice, and then woke up the cooks to cook rice, stir-fry vegetables, and boil water together, to ensure that the members could eat on time. Then he was busy arranging the dinner. On this day, the canteen had just the right amount of food, and the members were generally satisfied.

    挑起五百多人吃饭的担子
    广西隆林新州公社新州大队食堂总务隆福兴，是百色专署粮食局的下放干部。这个二十来岁的年青人，在食堂里干得真热火！他每天总管大队五百多人的吃饭生活问题，烧水、劈柴、分菜、分饭，样样活儿都有他一份。
    新州大队食堂过去由于管理不善，办得不够好。隆福兴刚下放到这里，公社党委毛书记便找他谈话，说：“你是做过粮食工作的，对食堂工作一定很熟悉，大队五百多人吃饭的担子就由你来挑吧！”隆福兴二话没说，一口答应了。不料，参加食堂工作的第一天，就遇到一些困难。他想：“五百多人的担子啊，实在不容易挑！”这时，毛书记发现了这个问题，鼓励他说：“这个担子，实在不轻啊！但是，把它挑起来，是青年人的责任，你在困难面前应该毫不畏惧，一往直前。”他听了毛书记的话，想起了自己的责任，就向党保证：一定要把食堂办好！党支部又专门开了个会，具体帮助他研究食堂存在的问题。第二天，天蒙蒙亮，他便起床，摸黑劈柴烧火，算好开饭人数，称好了米，然后叫醒炊事员，一起烧饭、炒菜、煮开水，保证社员能准时吃到饭。接着又忙着安排晚上的饭菜。这一天，食堂的饭菜不多也不少，社员普遍满意。
