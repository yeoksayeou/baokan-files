A new path to develop potato production at high speed

Workers at the Nandan Potato Seed Farm successfully experimented with planting potato seedlings and branches.

The new method uses only nine jin of seeds per mu, matures 20-30 days earlier, and increases yield by nearly double.

(According to a report in the Guangxi Daily) Workers at the Nandan Potato Seed Farm in Liuzhou Prefecture have created new methods for propagating potatoes: seedling planting and branch planting. Experiments have proven that these new methods can save a large number of seed potatoes, increase yields, advance maturity, and allow for three to four crops per year.

Saving Seed Potatoes

In the past, potatoes in Guangxi were planted using the tuber method, which had a high loss rate. Seed potatoes were also difficult to store, leading to a general shortage of seeds at planting time, requiring the import of large quantities from other areas. Seedling planting and branch planting can save a large number of seed potatoes, opening up a new path for the large-scale development of potato production.

Seedling planting involves transplanting the 4-5 inch long seedlings grown from seed potatoes sprouted in a seedbed to the field. Branch planting involves taking 8-9 inch long branches from potato seedlings in the field and planting them in other fields. In the past, the tuber planting method allowed cutting a seed potato into only three or four pieces, enough to plant three or four holes, requiring 150 to 200 jin of seed potatoes per mu. If seedling planting is used, one jin of potatoes averages eight seed potatoes, each with an average of ten buds. Each bud can produce three seedlings, so each seed potato can be harvested for seedlings more than eighteen times (some seed potatoes have already been harvested eighteen times; future observations will determine how many more times they can be harvested). Each time, two to six seedlings can be harvested; taking four seedlings as an average, each seed potato can yield 72 seedlings, and one jin of seed potatoes can yield 576 seedlings. With 5,000 holes planted per mu, less than nine jin of seeds are needed per mu. Seedling planting reduces seed usage by 94% to 95.5% compared to tuber planting.

If branch planting is used, even more seed potatoes can be saved. A potato seedling generally has 15 to 18 branches, and at least ten can be taken. One mu of potato seedlings can then be used to plant ten mu. New branches from branch-planted potato seedlings can also be transplanted to the field, allowing for planting every day, with greenery in all seasons. Propagated in this way, new potatoes can be continuously cultivated from branches, just like sweet potatoes.

Advancing Maturity

Seed tubers take about twenty days to root and leaf after sprouting. Without sprouting, it takes even longer. This process is completed in three to five days for seedling planting in the seedbed. After another four or five days, the seedlings have well-developed roots and four or five green leaves, at which point they can be transplanted to the field. Calculating from the growth time of potato seedlings in the field, seedling planting greatly shortens the time. At the same time, the temperature, air, humidity, and nutrients in the seedbed are suitable for seedlings during the seedling stage. The seedlings have enough nutrients before transplanting, which creates favorable conditions for the rapid development of the roots and stems of seedlings after transplanting, thereby promoting earlier maturity of tubers. According to a survey conducted by the farm, potato seedlings began to form tubers 20 to 25 days after being transplanted to the field, and fully matured in 80 to 90 days, 20 to 30 days earlier than tuber planting. For example, 66 Longjin potato seedlings transplanted by the farm on June 11 were harvested on August 28, after 77 days, yielding an average of 11 liang (approximately 0.69 kg) of potatoes per plant.

Branch planting produces tubers even earlier than seedling planting, with an even shorter maturity period. The farm's experiments show that tuber formation generally begins nine to ten days after planting, with the size of corn kernels. Currently, those planted on September 3 generally have three or four tubers per plant, with the larger ones the size of small eggs. It is expected that they can be harvested in another 20 to 30 days, with a maturity period of approximately 70 to 80 days. Branch planting leads to earlier tuber formation because the seedlings have already gone through the vernalization and photoperiod stages necessary for plant growth before transplanting, preparing conditions for tuber formation. Because potatoes from seedling planting and branch planting form tubers early, they can be harvested half a month to a month earlier than tuber planting, allowing land to be freed up to plant another crop of potatoes.

More Tubers, Higher Yields

In terms of yield, seedling planting also yields higher than tuber planting. Seedling planting involves planting the seedlings deep, with more nodes of the stem buried in the soil (generally more than five nodes). Tuber formation occurs at the stem nodes, so more tubers are formed. With tuber planting, it is not advisable to plant too deep, so only two nodes of the stem are buried in the soil, and fewer tubers are formed. In addition, seedling planting involves planting single plants, which can appropriately increase density, allowing for planting more than 5,000 holes per mu. Tuber planting, on the other hand, uses more seeds, resulting in more seedlings per hole, which requires a lot of labor for thinning, and also takes up more area underground, generally allowing for planting only about 3,000 holes per mu. Therefore, seedling planting can increase the unit area yield of potatoes. The farm conducted experiments on two plots, using seedling planting and tuber planting methods respectively: the seedling-planted plot was 0.89 mu, planted on July 18, and harvested on October 11, with a growth period of 82 days; the tuber-planted plot was 0.945 mu, planted on July 6, and harvested on October 11, with a growth period of 97 days. The harvesting results showed that the unit area yield of seedling planting was nearly doubled compared to tuber planting. From a single-plant perspective, seedling planting also produced more tubers and higher yields than tuber planting. As for the yield of branch planting, it is difficult to draw a conclusion at this time because it has not yet been harvested, but based on the current growth and tuber formation, the yield is guaranteed.

Reducing Disease and Pest Damage

Experiments have also shown that using seedling planting and branch planting to grow potatoes can reduce the damage caused by late blight, a destructive disease for potatoes, and reduce the degree of variety degradation. Late blight is transmitted by soil or seed tubers, and the pathogen's reproductive ability is strongest at 12 to 13 degrees Celsius. If seedling planting is used, the temperature in the seedbed is not conducive to the reproduction of the pathogen, and the potato seedlings have already been separated from the parent plant before the pathogen reproduces, avoiding the late blight damage brought on by seed potatoes. Even if potato seedlings are infected with pathogens from seed potatoes before transplanting, the degree of infection will not be very deep, and with strengthened cultivation after transplanting, late blight damage can also be avoided. Branch planting does not come into contact with seed potatoes at all, which further reduces the possibility of late blight transmission by seed potatoes.

The degradation of potatoes is closely related to seed tubers being infected with late blight and other pathogens. Since seedling planting and branch planting can reduce the damage from late blight, they also have a certain effect on reducing the degree of variety degradation.

The success of using seedling planting and branch planting to cultivate potatoes is the result of the Nandan Potato Seed Farm's entire staff daring to think, daring to act, and daring to experiment. The farm was established in May of this year, and had no experience in cultivating potatoes in the past. Encouraged by the situation of large-scale agriculture and food production throughout the country, all employees were highly motivated and determined to complete the glorious task assigned to them by the higher-level Party committee. Faced with a shortage of seed potatoes, they studied the bud planting experience of other provinces, which could save a large number of seed potatoes, and made further developments based on this. In this process, they encountered many difficulties and experienced many failures, but thanks to the continuous encouragement and support of the higher-level Party committee, and their unyielding spirit, and their consistent adherence to the scientific research method of coming from practice and going into practice, they created new methods of cultivating potatoes: seedling planting and branch planting.

### 高速度发展马铃薯生产有新途径  南丹马铃薯原种繁殖场职工试验马铃薯苗栽和枝栽成功  新法种植每亩用种九斤，成熟期提早二三十天，产量增加近倍

    高速度发展马铃薯生产有新途径
    南丹马铃薯原种繁殖场职工试验马铃薯苗栽和枝栽成功
    新法种植每亩用种九斤，成熟期提早二三十天，产量增加近倍
    据广西日报消息　柳州专区南丹马铃薯原种繁殖场职工，创造了苗栽和枝条栽的繁殖马铃薯的新方法。试验证明：采用这些新方法，能够节省大批种薯，而且产量高，成熟早，一年可种三至四造。
    节　省　种　薯
    过去，广西地区种植马铃薯是块种法，这种办法耗损率高，加上种薯又不易保管，到种植时普遍缺种，不得不从外地调进大量种薯。而苗栽法和枝条栽法，则能大量节省种薯，从而为大量发展薯类生产开辟了一条新的途径。
    苗栽法是将经过苗床催芽的种薯生出的四至五寸长的幼苗移至大田中种植。枝条栽法是将大田薯苗生出的八至九寸长的枝条取下，栽到其它大田里。过去用块种法，一个种薯不过切三四块，能种三四穴，每亩需要种薯一百五十斤至二百斤。如果采用苗栽法，一斤马铃薯平均有八个种薯，平均每个种薯有十个芽眼，每个芽眼能出三个苗，每个种薯能取苗十八次以上
  （目前有部分种薯已取了十八次，究竟还能取多少次，待今后观察。），每次能取二至六苗，以四苗计，每个种薯可得七十二苗，每斤种薯可得五百七十六苗，以每亩种五千穴计，每亩用种不到九斤就够了。苗栽比块种的用种量减少94％到95.5％。
    如果采用枝条栽法，节省种薯更多。一株薯苗一般有十五至十八根枝条，起码能取十根，一亩薯苗就可以种十亩。用枝条栽法种植的薯苗，生出的新枝条，又能再次移至大田中种植，真是日日可种，四季常青，繁殖下去，和红薯一样，光用枝条，就可以不断地培育出新的马铃薯来。
    提　早　成　熟
    薯块播种，经过催芽的，一般要二十天左右才能生根、长叶。如果不催芽，时间还要更长。这个过程，苗栽的在苗床中培育三至五天就完成了，再培育四五天，幼苗便具有较发达的根系与四五片绿叶，这时便能移至大田中种植。从薯苗在大田中的生长时间计算，苗栽的大大地缩短了。同时，由于在育苗期间，苗床上的气温、空气、湿度、养分都很适宜，薯苗在移植前，已有充足的营养物质。为移植后薯苗的根系、茎叶的迅速发育创造了有利的条件，从而促使薯块提早成熟期。根据这个场的调查，薯苗移植到大田后二十至二十五天便开始结薯，八、九十天便完全成熟，比薯块播种提早二、三十天。如这个场于6月11日移植的龙津马铃薯薯苗六十六株，8月28日收获，前后七十七天，平均每株结薯十一两多。
    枝条栽的比苗栽的结薯还要早，成熟期还要短。这个场的试验说明，一般种下九至十天便开始结薯，有玉米粒大。现在，9月3日栽的，一般每株都结薯三、四个，大的有小鸡蛋大，预计再过二、三十天便可收获，成熟期大约七十至八十天。枝条栽的所以结薯早，是因为在移植前已经过植物生长过程里必须经过的春化阶段和光照阶段，为结薯准备了条件。由于苗栽和枝条栽的马铃薯结薯早，比块种的提早半个月至一个月收获，就可以早腾出地来多种一造马铃薯。
    结薯多　产量高
    从产量来看，用苗栽的也比块种的高，用苗栽的由于移植时种得深，埋在土里的茎部节数较多（一般在五节以上），结薯部位在茎节，因此结的薯块也较多。块种的由于播种时不宜种得过深，埋在土里的茎节只有两节，因此结的薯块也较少。另外，用苗栽的是单株种植，可以适当提高密度，每亩能种五千穴以上。而块种的因为花种多，每穴出苗多，间苗花工大，加上地下面积占的宽，一般每亩只种三千穴左右。因此苗栽的能提高马铃薯的单位面积产量。这个场有两块田，分别用苗栽和块种方法进行试验：苗栽的八分九厘，7月18日种植，10月11日收获，生长期八十二天；块种的九分四厘五，7月6日种植，10月11日收获，生长期九十七天；收获情况表明：苗栽的比块种的单位面积产量增产将近一倍。从单株来看，苗栽比块种的结薯也多，产量也高。枝条栽的产量如何，因为尚未收获，现在还很难作出结论，但从目前的生长和结薯情况看，产量是有保证的。
    减轻病疫危害
    实验还证明：用苗栽法和枝条栽法种马铃薯，还可以减轻对马铃薯有毁灭性影响的晚疫病的危害和降低品种退化的程度。晚疫病由土壤或种薯传染，一般在摄氏十二至十三度时，病菌繁殖能力最强。如果用苗栽法，由于苗床内的温度不大适于病菌繁殖，当病菌繁殖之前，薯苗已脱离母体，早日避免了因为种薯带来的晚疫危害。就是一旦薯苗在移植之前，感染上种薯上的病菌，程度也不会很深，只要在移植后加强培育，也能避免晚疫病危害。枝条栽的根本不接触种薯，就更减少了因种薯传染晚疫病的可能性。
    马铃薯的退化原因和种薯感染上晚疫病等病菌有很大关系，用苗栽和枝条栽法既然能够减轻晚疫病的危害，因此对降低品种的退化程度也有一定作用。
    用苗栽法和枝条栽法培植马铃薯成功是南丹马铃薯原种繁殖场全体职工敢想敢干，大胆试验的结果。这个场是在今年5月成立的，过去对培植马铃薯没有什么经验，在全国大办农业、大办粮食的形势鼓舞下，全体职工干劲冲天，坚决完成上级党委交给他们的光荣任务。种薯缺乏，他们学习了外省可以节省大量种薯培植马铃薯的芽栽经验，并且在这个基础上作了进一步的发展。在这个过程中，他们碰到了许多的困难，经过了多次的失败，但是由于上级党委的不断鼓舞和支持，由于他们具有百折不挠的精神，并且始终坚持了由实践中来到实践中去的科学研究的方法，创造了苗栽和枝条栽的培植马铃薯的新方法。（附图片）
