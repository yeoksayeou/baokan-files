Xianyang Industrial System Leading Cadres Concurrently Serve as Deputy Positions in Production Teams
    Learning Humbly from the Masses to Better Lead Them

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 9th) The vast numbers of industrial cadres in Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, have gone deep into production teams to concurrently serve as deputy positions. They participate in production as ordinary laborers in the teams and learn humbly as elementary school students. This not only strengthens the leadership at the grassroots level, but also enables the vast numbers of cadres to further cultivate a working style based on the mass line and improve their leadership skills, thereby powerfully promoting production.

    Currently, 90% of the cadres in the city's industrial system, from the city party secretary, ministers, bureau chiefs to the factory, workshop, and section leaders, concurrently hold the position of deputy team leader of production teams. They regularly participate in and lead production as one of the team members every week. In order to maintain this system, all industrial departments and factories in the city have divided all cadres into several groups, who take turns going deep into the teams. The factories have also published the list of cadres concurrently serving as deputy team leaders, mobilizing workers to supervise the implementation of this measure.

    When participating in the production and work of the teams, the vast numbers of cadres in Xianyang City, in accordance with the requirements of the municipal party committee, humbly act as students of the masses. For example, Nie Lisan, director of the fine yarn workshop of Northwest State-owned Cotton No. 2 Factory, served as the deputy team leader of Class A, Group 5. In his labor, he strictly abides by discipline, obeys the tasks assigned by the team leader, and earnestly learns from the workers. The relationship between the workers and him is even closer, and they respect him even more. Many workers take the initiative to report the situation to him, and sometimes make pertinent criticisms of him. Because the cadres take the attitude of willingly being elementary school students to concurrently serve as deputy positions in the teams, they can better discover advanced experiences and advanced ideas among the masses. This enriches their work experience and enables them to do a better job in leadership. In Class A, Group 5, Nie Lisan discovered the good experience of holding small meetings at the beginning of shifts, adjusting forces in a timely manner, and solving production problems, and promptly promoted it throughout the workshop. At the same time, he also discovered some shortcomings in the group's work, such as the team cadres relying too much on activists and not helping backward workers enough, which often affected the entire group because individual backward workers failed to complete their tasks well. From this, he also more deeply realized the importance of grasping both ends and leading the middle. The fine yarn workshop of Northwest State-owned Cotton No. 1 Factory had proposed to eliminate backward machines long ago, but had not achieved it for a long time. This time, after workshop director Jia Xiaozhou served concurrently as the deputy team leader of the Zhao Mengtao team, he found that worker Zheng Qiuyue, in addition to checking her own machines when handing over and taking over shifts, also helped her neighbors check machines and provide technical guidance, so that the workers around her could complete their plans in a balanced manner. Jia Xiaozhou was greatly inspired by this. He then put forward the call of "everyone cares about the plan, everyone cares about the collective" to all the workers in the workshop, and established Zheng Qiuyue, a model worker with no backwardness on her left and right, and widely promoted her experience, which played a great role in comprehensively and evenly completing the plan.

    In the past, some cadres went to grassroots units, often only "glancing at flowers from horseback," or only understanding and solving a certain problem, so they often "person leaves, heart leaves, work leaves"; now, after the cadres concurrently serve as deputy positions in the teams, they labor together with the workers, and "plant flowers with their own hands" with the workers, which establishes a deeper friendship with the workers and enables their leadership work to take root in the teams. Li Xiuquan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Xianyang Municipal Party Committee, concurrently serves as the deputy team leader of the mechanic workshop of the Xianyang Water Conservancy Machinery Factory. The workers in the workshop are familiar with him, and he is also familiar with most of the workers in the team and the workshop. In this way, he can not only understand the main problems in the current industrial production in a timely and profound manner, but also understand the workers' thoughts and requirements, and obtain various first-hand materials. As a result, the leadership of production by cadres at all levels can be more specific and in-depth. Xiu Xinqing, secretary of the party branch of the Xianyang Water Conservancy Machinery Factory, originally heard that some workers in the forging workshop were unwilling to use the spring hammer and blanking machine manufactured in the technical innovation, and still wielded sledgehammers. At that time, he thought this was a matter of habit, and the problem would be solved as long as the workers were given more education. After he concurrently served as the deputy team leader of the forging hammer team and labored with the workers, he found that the spring hammer had shortcomings that needed to be improved; he further understood the use of innovative machines throughout the factory, and found that most of the machines that were not used in production had shortcomings in the equipment itself, or because the workers had not yet mastered the new technology. He then organized the factory's main technical force to concentrate on improving the important innovative machines with shortcomings, and trained workers to master operating techniques, so that most of the factory's innovation projects could be used normally.

### 咸阳工业系统领导干部到生产小组兼任副职  虚心向群众学习　更好地领导群众

    咸阳工业系统领导干部到生产小组兼任副职
    虚心向群众学习　更好地领导群众
    本报西安9日电　陕西省咸阳市广大工业干部深入到生产小组兼任副职，在小组里以普通劳动者的身份参加生产，以当小学生的态度虚心学习。这样既加强了基层的领导力量，又使广大干部进一步培养了群众路线的工作作风，提高了领导水平，因而有力地推动了生产。
    目前，全市工业系统90％的干部，从市委书记、部长、局长到工厂、车间、工段的负责人，都兼任了生产小组副组长的职务，每周定期地作为小组的成员之一，参加生产领导生产。为了使这一制度坚持下去，全市各工业部门和各厂都把全体干部分为几套人马，轮流深入小组。各厂还公布了兼任副小组长的干部名单，发动工人监督这一措施的实施。
    咸阳市广大干部在参加小组的生产和工作时，都根据市委的要求，虚心当群众的学生。例如，西北国棉二厂细纱车间主任聂礼三到甲班五组担任副组长。他在劳动中严格遵守纪律，服从组长分配的任务，认真向工人们学习。工人们同他的关系更加密切，而且更加爱戴他。许多工人主动向他反映情况，有时还对他提出中肯的批评。由于干部们抱着甘心当小学生的态度到小组兼任副职，他们就能更好地在群众中发现先进经验、先进思想。这就丰富了他们的工作经验，把领导工作做得更好。聂礼三在甲班五组就发现了经常开车头小型会议，及时调整力量，解决生产问题等好经验，并在全车间及时推广。同时，他也发现了这个组工作中的一些缺点，例如小组干部依靠积极分子多，帮助后进工人差，以致常因个别后进工人完成任务不好而影响全组。从这里，他也更深刻地体会到了抓两头带中间的重要意义。西北国棉一厂细纱车间很早就提出要消灭落后机台，但长时间没有实现。这次，车间主任贾效周到赵梦桃小组兼任副组长以后，发现工人郑秋月每天交班和接班时，除检查自己使用的机台以外，还帮助左邻右舍检查机台，并进行技术指导，使她左右的工人都能均衡地完成计划。贾效周从这件事得到很大启示。他便向全车间工人提出了“人人关心计划，人人关心集体”的号召，并且树立了郑秋月这样一个自己左右无落后的标兵，普遍推广了她的经验，对全面均衡地完成计划起了很大作用。
    过去，有些干部到基层单位，往往只是“走马观花”，或者仅是了解和解决某一个问题，因此常常“人走心走工作走”；现在，干部们在小组兼任副职以后，同工人一起劳动，和工人一起“亲手栽花”，这就同工人建立起更加深厚的情谊，并使自己的领导工作在小组中扎下了根子。中共咸阳市委书记处书记李秀全在咸阳水利机械厂机工车间兼任副小组长，车间里的工人都熟悉他，他也熟悉小组以及车间的大多数工人。这样，他就不仅能及时深刻地了解当前工业生产中的主要问题，而且了解工人们的思想和要求，得到各种第一手的材料。结果，各级干部对生产的领导就能更加具体深入。咸阳水利机械厂党支部书记修新卿原来听说锻工车间有些工人不愿意使用在技术革新中制造的弹簧锤和下料机，仍旧抡大锤，当时他认为这是习惯问题，只要对工人加强教育，问题就解决了。他兼任锻锤组副小组长以后，和工人一起劳动，才发现弹簧锤有缺点，需要改进；他又进一步了解了全厂革新机具的使用情况，发现没有用到生产上去的机具，大都是设备本身有缺点，或者是因为工人还没有掌握新技术。他便组织全厂主要技术力量突击改进有缺点的重要革新机具，并且训练工人掌握操作技术，使全厂革新项目绝大部分都能正常使用。
