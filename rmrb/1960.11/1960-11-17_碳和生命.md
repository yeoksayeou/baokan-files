    Carbon and Life
    Shigong
    Have you ever considered how essential carbon is to our lives? What if there were no carbon on Earth?
    If there were no carbon, the vast majority of factories worldwide would have to shut down, and many modes of transportation would be unable to operate. This is because currently, over ninety percent of the energy consumed by humans annually comes from the combustion of carbon and carbon-containing substances.
    In fact, without carbon, there would be no question of factories or anything of the sort, because without carbon, there would be no life. Animals eat plants, and the main "food" for plants is carbon; every year, all the plants on Earth "eat" approximately 230 billion tons of carbon from carbon dioxide.
    Carbon is the foundation of all life. However, its content in the Earth's crust is not very high, accounting for only 0.35% of the total weight of the crust. Most of this carbon is stored in rocks and mineral deposits such as coal and petroleum. The carbon in living matter is only a little over one-thousandth of all the carbon in the Earth's crust.
    Carbon plays a backbone role in living matter. Just like a house needs a frame, carbon atoms arrange and combine to form the "frame" of organic matter. Carbon atoms can connect to each other like a chain, and chains composed of six carbon atoms often join at both ends to form a ring. These rings can then connect to each other, making the "frame" extremely complex. Other elements' atoms are then combined according to different situations, which forms a wide variety of organic matter.
    What would happen to carbon if there were no life?
    Carbon has existed on Earth since its formation, but before the emergence of life, carbon was not able to display the myriad transformations and brilliance it does today. It could only form some simple compounds, which should be classified as inorganic substances. For example, carbon dioxide, formed by the combination of carbon and oxygen, was abundant at that time. Due to the large amount of carbon dioxide dissolving in seawater and combining with calcium to form calcium carbonate, it precipitated on the seabed and turned into limestone. The thickness of these limestones is astonishing. For example, in the northern part of our country more than 500 million years ago (which was then an ocean), the limestone formed was several thousand meters thick. As life gradually emerged and developed, plants absorbed large amounts of carbon dioxide, and the limestone formed later became thinner and thinner. At this point, carbon was no longer a simple compound; it threw itself into the activity of making the earth colorful and vibrant with life.
    It should be said that carbon provides life with materials, while life creates the miracle of transforming carbon in countless ways.
    It is plants that introduce carbon into this process of change, the leaves of plants, the chlorophyll in the leaves of plants.
    Under a microscope, we can find that a cabbage leaf can have more than ten million stomata! Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through these stomata and, with the help of sunlight and the action of chlorophyll, changes with water to create various organic substances, which are the source of wood, fruits, grains, and cotton.
    After carbon is introduced into plants, it undergoes even more complex changes as plants are eaten by animals or die and decay. A large amount of carbon forms carbon dioxide in the bodies of animals and is exhaled into the air; all of humanity exhales more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. After organisms die, a large amount of carbon dioxide is also produced due to decay and decomposition. Sometimes, due to being covered by water and sediment, the carbon in them is preserved and becomes products such as coal and petroleum.
    Regarding these changes, until the early 19th century, many people still believed that they were caused by a mysterious "life force" and were unknowable. But science has finally unraveled this extremely complex mystery in nature. The work of creation is great, but humans have created even greater miracles.
    We are beginning to be able to mass-produce many organic substances that we need.
    We have produced many plastics that can replace metals, wood, glass and other materials, and man-made fibers that can replace wool, cotton and silk; many things such as spices, dyes, saccharin, leather, and oils have become man-made. The industry that manufactures these things is called the organic synthesis industry. We can not only create these things, but the quality of the products is often much better than those produced naturally.
    However, this should not be interpreted as meaning that we can do without the action of life, because when artificially manufacturing various products, we need to build many factories and consume a lot of energy, but every plant is playing the role of a factory. They are widely distributed everywhere and absorb huge amounts of energy from the sun. Why don't we make use of them? It should be known that plants' absorption of solar energy is still not sufficient. Under the best conditions, the energy absorbed by chlorophyll is still less than 8% of the energy radiated onto the leaves, and in many cases, the leaves are not fully irradiated. Therefore, as long as we thoroughly implement the Eight-Point Charter for agricultural production increase, improve the role of chlorophyll, and make fuller use of solar energy, it is possible to enable this "green factory" to capture more carbon dioxide from the air and multiply the output.
    Of course, the organic synthesis industry must also develop at high speed. In the Soviet Union's Seven-Year Plan, the output of man-made fibers will increase by 2.8 to 3 times, while the output of plastics and synthetic resins will increase by 5.7 times. China's organic synthesis industry will also make great progress, and we are creating a colorful and infinitely beautiful world!
    The power of life is infinite. Although our industry will be highly developed, it is impossible to replace the work of life that is widespread across the Earth. Therefore, agriculture, which uses the cultivation of organisms for production, must also develop endlessly.

    碳和生命
    石工
    你曾经想过碳对我们的生活有多么需要吗？假使地球上没有碳，一切又将如何呢？
    假使没有碳，全世界绝大部分工厂都要停工了，许多交通工具也不能运行了。因为目前每年人类所消耗的能，有百分之九十几来自碳和含碳物质的燃烧。
    其实在没有碳的时候，哪里谈得到什么工厂之类的问题，因为没有碳就没有生命。动物吃植物，植物的主要“粮食”则是碳；每年，地球上所有的植物大约要“吃”掉二千三百亿吨碳酸气中的碳。
    碳是一切生命的基础。但是它在地壳中的含量却并不算多，仅占地壳总重量的0.35％，这些碳绝大部分贮存在岩石和煤、石油等矿藏里，在活物质中的碳只有地壳中所有的碳的千分之一多一点。
    碳在活物质里，起着骨干作用。就像盖房子少不了屋架一样，碳原子排列组合起来成为有机物的“屋架”；碳原子能够自己连接起来像链条一样，由六个碳原子组成的链条两端还常常结合起来成为环状，这些环又可以相互连接，因此，“屋架”的形式非常复杂，其他元素的原子再按照不同情况组合进去，这就形成了种类繁多的有机物。
    假使没有生命，碳又该怎样呢？
    自从地球一形成，地球上就有碳了，但在生命还没有出现以前，碳并没有能像今天一样千变万化，放出异彩，它只能形成些简单的化合物，是应当归入无机物一类的，譬如碳和氧化合而成的碳酸气那时就很多。由于大量碳酸气在海水中溶解，与水中的钙质化合形成碳酸钙，沉淀在海底变成了石灰岩。这些石灰岩的厚度是惊人的，如五亿多年以前在我国北方一带
  （当时是海洋）造成的石灰岩厚达几千米。由于生命逐渐发生和发展，植物吸收了大量的碳酸气，以后，再形成的石灰岩就愈来愈薄了，这时碳不再是简单的化合物，它投身到使大地变得万紫千红、生命喧嚣的活动中去了。
    应该说，碳提供生命以材料，而生命则创造出使碳千变万化的奇迹。
    把碳引入这个变化过程的是植物，是植物的叶子，是植物叶子中的叶绿素。
    在显微镜下观察，我们可以发现，一片白菜叶上的气孔可以达到一千多万个！碳酸气从这些气孔进入到叶片中，在阳光帮助下经过叶绿素的作用，和水发生变化，造成了各种有机物，这便是木材、水果、粮食、棉花的来源。
    碳被引到植物中以后，由于植物被动物吃掉或死亡腐败，就进入更加复杂的变化。大量的碳在动物体内形成碳酸气被呼到空中，全人类每年呼到大气中去的碳酸气达十亿吨以上。生物死亡后，由于腐败分解，也会造成大量碳酸气，有时由于得到水和泥沙的掩盖，其中的碳得以保存下来，变成了煤、石油等产物。
    对于这些变化，直到十九世纪初叶，不少人还认为是由于一种神秘的“生命力”造成的，是不可知的。但是科学终于揭开了自然中这个极为复杂的谜，造化之功是伟大的，但是人创造出了更大的奇迹。
    我们开始能够大量制造许多我们所需要的有机物。
    我们生产了许多可以代替金属、木料、玻璃等材料的塑料，可以代替羊毛、棉花、蚕丝的人造纤维；香料、染料、糖精、皮革、油脂等许多东西都有人造的了。制造这些东西的工业被称为有机合成工业。我们不仅能造出这些东西，而且产品的质量往往比天然生成的要优越得多。
    不过这也不能理解为就可以不依靠生命的作用，因为人工制造各种产品的时候，需要盖许多工厂，消耗大量的能，可是每一棵植物都在起着工厂的作用，它们广布各地，吸收了来自太阳的巨大的能，我们为什么不加以利用呢？要知道植物对太阳能的吸收还很不充分，在最好的条件下，叶绿素吸收的能量还不到射在叶片上的能量的8％，何况在许多时候叶片并未充分的受到照射。因此只要我们深入贯彻农业增产的八字宪法，提高叶绿素的作用，更充分的利用太阳能，就有可能使这个“绿色的工厂”从空气中捕捉更多的二氧化碳，成倍地提高产量。
    当然有机合成工业也是要高速度发展的，在苏联的七年计划中，人造纤维的产量将提高二点八至三倍，而塑料和人造树脂的产量则将提高五点七倍。我国的有机合成工业也将取得巨大的进展，我们正在创造一个万紫千红无限美好的世界！
    生命的力量是无穷的，尽管我们的工业将要高度发达，但是不可能代替广布地球的生命的工作。因此，利用培育生物来进行生产的农业，也一定要无穷尽地发展。
