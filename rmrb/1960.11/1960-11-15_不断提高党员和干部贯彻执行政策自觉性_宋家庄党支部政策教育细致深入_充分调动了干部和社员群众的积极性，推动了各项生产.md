The Songjiazhuang Party Branch, in order to help cadres frequently grasp the Party's policies, stipulated a regular learning system, and at the same time, paid attention to summarizing and promoting experience through key experiments, and constantly carried out inspections in the process of implementation, and promptly solved problems. This branch also attached particular importance to the supervisory role of the masses in implementing the Party's policies to ensure the effective implementation of the Party's various policies.

(Reported by this newspaper) The Songjiazhuang Brigade Party Branch of Chengguan Commune, Linxian County, Henan Province, conscientiously ensured the implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies, thus fully mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

The Songjiazhuang Brigade Party Branch attaches importance to policy education for Party members and cadres, paying attention to improving their policy level and consciousness in implementing policies. In daily work and in previous rectification movements, the Party branch paid attention to organizing everyone to combine with actual work, and improve ideological understanding and strengthen the concept of implementing policies through airing views, debates. In order to better help everyone grasp the Party's various policies, the branch stipulated a regular learning system and also organized the "Five Comparisons and Five Views"
(compare study, view work; compare drive, view policy implementation; compare research, view whether problems can be discovered in work; compare mobilization, view the degree of understanding; compare the implementation of the learning system, view the effect) and "Three Packages" (old cadres package new cadres, branch committee members package Party members, Party members package the masses) competition activities. In this way, not only the policy ideological level of Party members and cadres was improved, but also their working ability was improved. For example, Comrade Cui Youxin, Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee and concurrently Secretary of the Songjiazhuang Party Branch, specifically helped Songjiazhuang team cadres Liu Fengxian and Gao Liangfu understand the spirit of the Party's policies in their work, and studied with them the methods of implementing labor quotas and work point assessment policies, thereby promoting the production of the team, which rose from a backward team to a second-class team. Comrade Liu Fengxian said with emotion: Secretary Cui helps us learn and helps us do, which made me realize that the Party's policies are matters in the hearts of the masses, and we must conscientiously implement the policies. Through study and work, Party members and cadres realized the great significance of implementing policies, their learning became more active, and their consciousness of implementing policies was greatly improved. In the summary work in the first half of this year, those who were rated as having good policy implementation and outstanding work achievements accounted for 73.2% of the total number of Party members in the branch.

In publicizing and implementing the Party's guidelines and policies, the Songjiazhuang Party Branch also paid attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experience through key experiments, and constantly inspecting in the process of implementation, discovering problems, and solving them in a timely manner. In this way, it not only enriched and improved the leadership level, but also cultivated and improved the cadres. In this year's "Small Autumn Harvest" campaign, in order to implement the county party committee's policy of giving priority to the collective, the collective should handle large quantities, and commune members should harvest small quantities, branch secretary Cui Youxin and branch deputy secretary Cui Gengcheng went deep into the Xiao'erzhuang team to explore specific methods for handling the relationship between the collective and the individual in the small autumn harvest. After summarizing and promoting it, a high tide of small autumn harvest movement in which everyone participated and everyone took action quickly appeared in the entire brigade, and the task of small autumn harvest was quickly overfulfilled. Both the team and the individual increased their income. In the process of implementing the policy of distribution according to work and work-point assessment, the branch adopted the method of continuously inspecting and organizing exchanges of experience in grassroots units, discovering problems, and correcting the phenomena of individual teams setting quotas too high or having improper assessment methods, so that the policy truly became a driving force for stimulating production enthusiasm and improving labor efficiency. The public canteen of 58 households only in Guangkou handed over the canteen's "family property" to the masses in arranging the lives of commune members, announced the meal schedule on time, and carried out in-depth education on grain policies and saving grain. The masses understood the canteen's "family property" and clarified the policy of "fixed quantity per person, savings belong to oneself." Every household formulated a plan for planned grain consumption and saving grain consumption. In the past two months, not only was a portion of grain saved, but the commune members also spontaneously stored more than 10,000 catties of dried vegetables. After the branch organized team cadres and administrators to learn the experience of this canteen in handing over the policy to the masses, the 16 canteens in the entire brigade have greatly improved in saving grain and planning grain consumption, ensuring that the commune members eat their fill and eat well, and have savings.

The Songjiazhuang Brigade Party Branch also attached particular importance to ensuring the effective implementation of the Party's policies under the supervision of the masses. This summer, wheat had a bumper harvest. In the summer distribution, individual brigade cadres one-sidedly emphasized that the original contract targets for the teams were too low and did not intend to implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system. The brigade party branch organized everyone to study the "three guarantees and one reward" policy again and organized everyone to recall last year's experience. In 1959, because the "three guarantees and one reward" was resolutely implemented, the teams that won the awards were more motivated, the teams with average production also stepped up their efforts, and the teams with reduced production strived not to reduce production again. Therefore, this year, the number of over-production teams increased from six in 1959 to nine, the number of average-production teams decreased from five to four, and the number of reduced-production teams decreased from five to three. After presenting the facts and reasoning, everyone unanimously agreed that it is necessary to resolutely implement the production contract in order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the team and the broad masses of commune members. After the meeting, nine over-production teams were rewarded according to the contract. The cadres of the over-production teams proposed: "We must boost our efforts and ensure that we are red every month, and strive to over-fulfill the task." The teams with reduced production also received a great education, and the commune members unanimously proposed to actively manage the wheat well and have a big over-production next year.

    不断提高党员和干部贯彻执行政策自觉性
    宋家庄党支部政策教育细致深入
    充分调动了干部和社员群众的积极性，推动了各项生产
    宋家庄党支部为了帮助干部经常掌握党的政策，规定了定期学习制度，同时注意通过重点试验，总结推广经验，并在贯彻执行过程中，不断进行检查，发现问题及时解决。这个支部在贯彻执行党的政策时，还特别重视群众的监督作用，保证党的各项政策切实执行。
    本报讯　河南省林县城关公社宋家庄大队党支部，认真保证党的方针政策的贯彻执行，因而充分地调动了广大社员群众的生产积极性。
    宋家庄大队党支部重视对于党员、干部的政策教育，注意提高党员干部的政策水平和执行政策的自觉性。党支部在日常工作及历次整社工作中，都注意组织大家结合实际工作，通过鸣放辩论，提高思想认识，增强执行政策的观念。为了更好地帮助大家掌握党的各项政策，支部规定了定期的学习制度，并且组织开展了“五比五看”
  （比学习、看工作，比干劲、看执行政策，比钻研、看能否在工作中发现问题，比发动、看领会程度，比执行学习制度、看效果）和“三包”（老干部包新干部、支委包党员、党员包群众）的竞赛活动。这样，不仅提高了党员干部的政策思想水平，也提高了工作能力。如公社党委副书记兼宋家庄党支部书记崔有信同志，在工作中具体帮助宋家庄小队干部刘凤仙、高良福领会党的政策精神，并和他们一起研究实行劳动定额和评工记分政策的方法，从而推动了该小队的生产，由后进队上升为二类队。刘凤仙同志感动地说：崔书记帮助我们学，又帮助我们做，使我认识到党的政策就是群众心眼里的事，非认真贯彻政策不可。通过学习和工作，党员、干部认识到了贯彻执行政策的重大意义，学习更积极了，执行政策的自觉性也大大提高了。今年上半年在总结工作中，被评为执行政策好、工作成绩显著的，占支部党员总数的73.2％。
    宋家庄党支部在宣传贯彻党的方针政策中，还注意通过重点试验，总结推广先进经验，和在贯彻执行过程中不断检查，发现问题，及时解决。这样，不仅丰富、提高了领导水平，而且也培养提高了干部。在今年的“小秋收”运动中，为了贯彻执行县委提出的以集体为主，大宗集体搞，小宗社员收的政策，支部书记崔有信和支部副书记崔根成深入到小二庄小队摸索在小秋收中处理集体与个人两者关系的具体办法。经过总结推广后，在全大队迅速出现了一个人人参加、个个动手的小秋收运动高潮，很快便超额完成了小秋收的任务。小队和个人都增加了收入。在贯彻执行按劳分配、评工记分的政策过程中，支部采取深入基层不断检查组织交流经验的办法，发现问题，随时纠正了个别小队定额偏高或评定方法不当的现象，使政策确实成为激励生产积极性和提高劳动效率的动力。光口头一个五十八户的公共食堂，在安排社员生活中，把食堂“家底”交给群众，按时公布饭表，并深入进行有关粮食政策和节约用粮的教育，群众了解了食堂的“家底”，明确了“依人定量，节约归己”的政策，户户都制订了计划用粮、节约用粮的计划，两个月来不仅节余一部分粮食，社员们还自动储备干菜一万多斤。支部组织队干部和管理员学习了这个食堂把政策交给群众的经验后，全大队十六个食堂在节约用粮、计划用粮方面，都有很大改进，保证了社员吃饱吃好，并有了节余。
    宋家庄大队党支部还特别重视在群众的监督下保证党的政策的切实执行。今年夏季小麦丰收了，在夏季分配中，个别大队干部片面强调原来对小队的包产指标偏低，不打算执行“三包一奖”制度，大队党支部一边组织大家再次学习了
  “三包一奖”政策，一边又组织了大家回忆去年的经验。1959年由于坚决执行了“三包一奖”，得奖队干劲更大了，平产队也加油赶，减产队力争不再减产。所以，今年由1959年六个超产小队增加到九个，平产队由五个减少为四个，减产队由五个减少为三个。经过摆事实，讲道理，大家一致认为：必须坚决贯彻执行包产合同，才能充分调动小队和广大社员的积极性。会后按合同奖励了九个超产队。超产队的干部提出：“要再鼓干劲，保证月月红，争取再超额完成任务。”减产队也受到了很大教育，社员们一致提出要积极管理好小麦，明年要来个大超产。
