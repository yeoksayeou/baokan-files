    Young People in All Walks of Life in Hebei Province Carry Forward the Revolutionary Spirit and Resolve to Compete with Xing Yanzi

    (Our report) After the People's Daily published the editorial "Love Agricultural Labor, Strengthen Agricultural Production, and Build a Beautiful and Happy Rural People's Commune" on October 23, the People's Communes in rural Hebei Province, as well as industrial and mining enterprises, schools, and government organizations, universally organized Communist Youth League members and young people to study it carefully. Through methods such as reading the newspaper, explanations, and discussions, the socialist and communist education of the young people was strengthened, and their awareness was raised. Many students in the third grade of Tianjin No. 2 Girls' Middle School used the editorial as a mirror to examine their own thinking and study. Yuan Yingxue, Wang Ping and other students of Senior Grade Three Class A, who were working in the countryside at the time, immediately wrote applications to the Communist Youth League branch after reading the editorial, requesting that after graduating from middle school, they be sent to the front line of agriculture to contribute to the rural people's communes. Zhang Wen, a student at Weizhen Middle School in Nangong County, was greatly inspired after reading the editorial, which made him recognize the bright future. Through in-depth study, he said: It is the glorious task of our younger generation to change the backward situation of "poverty and blankness" in rural areas and gradually reduce and eliminate the three differences. Our future lies in the countryside, in the People's Communes.

    Through studying the editorial, young people in all walks of life throughout the province have requested to go to the places where the Party needs them most, and to personally build a beautiful and happy rural People's Commune. 63,000 young people from the non-agricultural production front in Baoding City have already rushed to the front line of agricultural production. Young people originally on the second line in rural areas have also actively carried out clever arrangements, vigorously engaged in high work efficiency, freed up their hands and feet, and returned to the first line. The city quickly increased from the original 430,000 young people on the first line to 520,000. 100,000 young people in Shulu County, with the spirit of Xing Yanzi, vigorously engaged in manure accumulation and worked hard for ten days, accumulating 2.1 million cartloads of manure and cutting more than 10 million catties of grass. Zhang Xiaoli, a farmer innovator from Yaotou Production Team in this county, proposed a new leap forward plan after reading about the deeds of Xing Yanzi and other advanced figures in the newspaper, determined to compete with Xing Yanzi, and further created new agricultural tools such as close-planting drills, slicing machines, and drying machines.

    Xing Yanzi's revolutionary spirit of striving for self-improvement and hard struggle is not only a good example for young people in rural areas, but also a model for the vast number of young workers on the industrial front to learn from. The vast number of young people on the industrial front are striving to win high yields of steel, iron, and coal over large areas, and are launching a campaign to enter 1961 ahead of schedule. The image of outstanding young people like Xing Yanzi enables them to dare to "attack key points when they see them, and take on difficulties when they encounter them." The Yanzi-style key attack team of Fengfeng No. 3 Mine voluntarily worked hard for three days to meet production needs, repairing 450 broken lamps. The Yanzi Shock Team composed of fifteen girls from Fuyang Iron Works found the most difficult jobs to do in various activities, and production improved rapidly.

    河北省各行各业青年发扬革命精神
    决心和邢燕子比高低
    本报讯　10月23日人民日报发表了“热爱农业劳动，加强农业生产，建设美好幸福的农村人民公社”的社论以后，河北省农村人民公社、以及工矿企业、学校和机关单位，普遍组织团员和青年认真学习。通过读报、讲解、讨论等方式，加强了青年们的社会主义、共产主义教育，提高了青年的觉悟。天津女二中高中三年级许多学生把社论当做一面镜子，对照自己的思想进行学习。高三甲班袁英雪、王萍等学生当时正在农村劳动，读到这篇社论后，立即向共青团支部写了申请书，要求在中学毕业后，派她们到农业第一线去，为农村人民公社贡献自己的力量。南宫县威镇中学学生张文读了社论后，启发很大，使他认清了光明前途。通过深入学习，他说：改变农村“一穷二白”的落后面貌，逐步缩小和消灭三个差别，是我们青年一代光荣的任务。我们的前途就在农村，就在人民公社。
    通过学习社论，全省各行各业青年们纷纷要求到党最需要的地方去，要亲手建设美好幸福的农村人民公社。保定市非农业生产战线的六万三千名青年，已经奔赴农业生产第一线，原来在农村第二线上的青年，也积极进行了巧安排，大搞高工效，腾出手脚，纷纷回到第一线，全市由原来的第一线上的四十三万名青年，很快就增加到五十二万。束鹿县十万青年以邢燕子精神大搞积肥、大干十天，积肥二百一十万车，打草一千多万斤。这个县的摇头生产队农民革新家张小礼，读了报上登的邢燕子等先进人物的事迹以后又提出了新的跃进计划，决心和邢燕子比高低，又进一步创造了密植耧、切片机、烘干机等新式农具。
    邢燕子发愤图强、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，不仅是农村青年的好榜样，也是工业战线广大青年职工学习的典范。工业战线广大青年奋夺钢、铁、煤大面积高产，开展提前跨进1961年运动，邢燕子等优秀青年人的形象，使他们勇于“见关键就突，见困难就上”。峰峰三矿燕子式攻关键队，为满足生产需要，义务大干三天，修复坏灯四百五十盏。滏阳铁厂由十五个姑娘组成的燕子突击队，在各种活动中，找最艰苦的活干，生产提高很快。
