Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 30th - On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian national independence war, the Premier of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, Abbas Ferhat, received Xinhua News Agency reporters in Tunis today and said that the current situation of the Algerian national liberation war is very good. After six years of national liberation war, the Algerian National Liberation Army has grown into a force of more than 100,000 people, and the Algerian people, young and old, have a high level of awareness. They clearly understand that they are fighting for the liberation of their motherland.

He said that the Algerian National Liberation Army is an invincible army that has resisted 850,000 French troops equipped with modern weapons provided by the North Atlantic Group. Premier Abbas emphasized that under the current conditions, we mainly use guerrilla warfare to contain a large number of enemy troops. He said that guerrilla warfare is very good, it not only causes the enemy to suffer military losses, but also causes the enemy to suffer great economic difficulties and losses, making it impossible for foreign monopoly capitalists to extract huge profits in Algeria as they wish. Guerrilla warfare makes the price of Saharan oil higher than the price of Venezuelan oil. He said that we are prepared to carry out this advantageous armed struggle for a long time.

Speaking of negotiations with France, Premier Abbas said that France has never changed its attitude, as De Gaulle's recent trip to Nice proved. The negotiations that France wants are limited to a ceasefire, and the ceasefire that France wants is essentially a surrender. The French government attempts to negotiate with us in the posture of a victor towards the vanquished, so there is no common language between us, and such negotiations can never take place, because the Algerian people will never accept surrender negotiations.

Premier Abbas pointed out: "The current international situation is very favorable to the Algerian struggle." He said that the Soviet Union's de facto recognition of Algeria is conducive to the Algerian people's struggle. He pointed out that Algeria is an African country, and its struggle is linked to the liberation struggle of the entire African people. Africa will surely be liberated, and the Algerian people will surely achieve independence.

Premier Abbas said when talking about his impressions of his visit to China that he was very satisfied with his visit to China. He said that he brought back from China the Chinese people's assistance and support for the Algerian people, and also brought back spiritual strength. He emphasized that the spiritual strength shown by the Chinese people in the cause of building their motherland is a great encouragement to the Algerian people. He said that he not only brought back China's material assistance but also brought back the New China people's friendship, unity, and support for the Algerian people, which is invaluable.

He said that this friendship between the Algerian and Chinese people will become an important era in the history of the Algerian people. The great friendship of the Chinese people is a great help to the Algerian people who are fighting for independence and freedom. Premier Abbas asked reporters to convey the Algerian people's praise and friendship to the great Chinese people. He emphasized that the friendship between Algeria and China is unbreakable. He said that the friendly relations between Algeria and China will become cultural and economic exchanges and friendly exchanges after Algeria gains independence, which will be very important and beneficial to the people of both countries.

Premier Abbas said that the revolution carried out by China is a great revolution, which has a huge impact on Asia and Africa, because Asia and Africa have suffered from colonial rule in the past. Today, China's achievements in industrialization and technological progress provide an example for Asia and Africa.

Finally, he hoped that the Chinese and Algerian people will fight side by side for world peace and human progress.

    阿巴斯总理在阿尔及利亚独立战争六周年前夕说：
    阿准备长期武装斗争直到最后胜利
    中国人民的伟大友谊对阿尔及利亚人民的斗争是巨大帮助
    新华社突尼斯30日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯·费尔哈特今天在阿尔及利亚民族独立战争六周年的前夕在突尼斯接见新华社记者说，目前阿尔及利亚民族解放战争的形势很好。经过六年民族解放战争，阿尔及利亚民族解放军已经成长成为一支有着十几万人的部队，阿尔及利亚人民不分老幼都有着很高的觉悟。他们清楚地了解他们是为争取祖国的解放而斗争。
    他说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军是一支不可战胜的军队，它抗击了八十五万装备着有北大西洋集团提供的现代武装的法国军队。阿巴斯总理强调说，在目前条件下，我们主要用游击战牵制了敌人的大量军队。他说，游击战很好，它不仅使敌人在军事上失利，也使敌人在经济上遭到巨大困难和损失，使外国垄断资本家不可能如愿以偿地在阿尔及利亚榨取巨大的利润。游击战争使撒哈拉石油价格比委内瑞拉石油价格还要高。他说，我们准备长期进行这种有利的武装斗争。
    谈到和法国谈判，阿巴斯总理说，法国始终没有改变它的态度，戴高乐最近的尼斯之行证明了这一点。法国所要的谈判只限于停火，而法国所要的停火实质是一种投降。法国政府企图以战胜者对战败者的姿态来同我们进行谈判，因而我们之间没有共同语言，这种谈判永远不可能进行，因为阿尔及利亚人民永远不会接受投降的谈判。
    阿巴斯总理指出：“目前的国际形势对阿尔及利亚斗争非常有利。”他说，苏联对阿尔及利亚事实上的承认有助于阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。他指出，阿尔及利亚是一个非洲国家，它的斗争和整个非洲人民的解放斗争是相联系的。非洲一定会获得解放，阿尔及利亚人民也一定会获得独立。
    阿巴斯总理谈到访问中国的印象时说，他对中国的访问很满意。他说，他从中国带回了中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的援助和支持，而且还带回来了精神力量，他强调说，中国人民在建设祖国的事业中所表现的精神力量是对阿尔及利亚人民的一个极大鼓舞。他说，他不仅带回来了中国的物质援助而且也带回来了新中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的友谊、团结和支持，这是无价之宝。
    他说，阿中两国人民的这种友谊，将成为阿尔及利亚人民历史的重要时代。中国人民的伟大友谊对于为独立自由而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民是巨大的帮助。阿巴斯总理要求记者向中国人民转达阿尔及利亚人民对伟大的中国人民的赞扬和友谊。他强调指出，阿中两国的友谊是牢不可破的。他说，阿中两国的友好关系在阿尔及利亚获得独立后将成为文化经济交流和友好往来，这将是很重要而且是有利于两国人民的。
    阿巴斯总理说，中国所进行的革命是个伟大的革命，它对亚非有着巨大的影响，因为亚洲和非洲过去都曾经遭受过殖民主义的统治，今天中国在工业化、技术进步等方面所取得的成就为亚非提供了榜样。
    最后，他希望中阿两国人民并肩为世界和平和人类的进步而共同战斗。
