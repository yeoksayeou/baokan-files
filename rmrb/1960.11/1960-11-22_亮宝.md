Showing the Treasure
Yi Zhi

Where the Party's policies are earnestly implemented, there the people are full of vigor, and there the production is thriving.

In Pinghsan County, Hopei Province, there is a South Rolling Dragon Gully, a gully over ten *li* long scattered with seventy-two households. In the gully, spring comes late and the land is cold, the wind is poisonous and the water is bad, “sunny days only provide half a day of sunlight, and good weather means only half a year's worth of grain.” This “Dragon” has suddenly taken off in the last three years, and its face has changed dramatically. The water in the gully “rolled” up the cliffs, and the historically grain-deficient area has become a surplus-grain team. The fundamental reason is that the Party’s General Line, general policies, and specific lines and policies for all tasks are shining brightly here.

The Party’s General Line and basic policies have pointed out the correct and glorious path of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The Party’s specific lines and policies, in turn, have shown people how to advance bravely and steadily on this path step by step. By always acting in accordance with the Party’s General Line and basic policies, one will never lose direction; by always acting in accordance with the Party’s specific lines and policies, one will always have solid strength. The specific lines and policies for all tasks are inseparable parts of the General Line and general policies; seriously, conscientiously, unswervingly, and consistently implementing the Party’s various policies is the most important sign of loyally and resolutely upholding the Party’s General Line. The comrades of the Party branch of the South Rolling Dragon Gully production team first consider acting in accordance with the Party’s policies whenever they do a job; whenever they encounter a problem, they first think about it from the perspective of policy. In this way, every task is illuminated by the light of policy, and every problem is solved with the key of policy; as a result, everyone is full of energy, everyone strives to move forward, and the “poor mountain village” has been transformed into a socialist “rich mountain village” in a faster, better, and more economical way, and continues to advance without stopping, to become even happier and more beautiful.

The Party's policies are such powerful magic weapons. Why do these same magic weapons seem to have particularly great power in some places, while in other places they have not yet fully demonstrated all their power? The reason lies here: these magic weapons have one characteristic, that is, they must be “shown” among the broad masses of the people in order to exert their power. The more people they are given to, the stronger their light and the greater their power. They themselves are extracted by the Party from the broad masses, and after the Party's concentration, refining, and polishing, they become comprehensive and advanced essences. Once they return to the masses and are mastered by the masses, they emit material power. Resolutely and thoroughly implementing every specific policy of the Party and handing over the Party's policies to the broad masses of the people is a basic organizational concept and mass viewpoint. The comrades of the Party branch of the South Rolling Dragon Gully production team deeply understand this point; they not only consider the Party's policies first when encountering something, but also immediately “show the treasure” among the masses and hand over the Party's policies to the masses. The more the policies are discussed by the masses, the brighter the light of the policies becomes, and the clearer the road ahead is illuminated; from the production team to the production squad to every commune member, initiative and enthusiasm are greatly developed, the drive becomes more and more sufficient, and the idea of collectivism becomes higher and higher.

In any place, the magic weapon of policy must be "shown" so that it illuminates the heart of every commune member, illuminates every remote mountain village, illuminates every specific task, and illuminates every step of the road of revolution and construction.

    党的政策在哪里能切实贯彻，哪里的人们便是干劲沸腾，哪里的生产便是欣欣向荣。
    河北平山县有一条南滚龙沟，十几里长一条沟散居着七十二户人家。山沟里春迟地寒，风毒水恶，“晴天只有半日照，风调雨顺半年粮”。这条“龙”近三年忽然飞腾起来，面貌大变。山沟里的水“滚”上了山崖，历年缺粮的地方变成了余粮队。根本原因，就是党的总路线、总政策和各项工作的具体路线、具体政策在这里大放光芒。
    党的总路线和基本政策，给人们指明了社会主义革命、社会主义建设的正确的光辉的道路。党的具体路线和具体政策，又给人们指明了怎样一步一步脚踏实地地在这条道路上奋勇前进。永远照着党的总路线和基本政策办事，就永远不会迷失方向；时时刻刻按着党的具体路线和具体政策办事，就时时刻刻都会有坚实的力量。各项工作的具体路线和具体政策都是总路线和总政策的不可分割的部分；严肃地认真地不折不扣地一贯到底地执行党的各项政策，是忠实地坚决地维护党的总路线的最重要的标志。南滚龙沟生产队党支部的同志们，每逢做一件工作，首先考虑要按党的政策办事；每遇到一个问题，首先从政策上来想一想。这样，每一件工作都被政策的光芒照亮了，每一个问题都用政策的钥匙解决了；于是，人人鼓足干劲，个个力争上游，“穷山庄”多快好省地变成了社会主义的“富山村”，还在不停顿地继续前进，要变得更加幸福美好。
    党的政策，就是这样威力巨大的法宝。同样的法宝，为什么在有的地方显得力量特别大，在有的地方还没有充分地显出它全部的威力？原因在这里：这些法宝有一个特点，就是一定要在广大群众中间“亮”出来才能发挥力量。把它们交给越多的群众，它们的光芒越强，威力越大。它们本身就是党从广大群众中提取出来的，经过党的集中、冶炼、琢磨之后，变成了全面的、高级的精华。它们一旦回到群众中去，为群众所掌握，就发出物质力量。坚决彻底地执行党的每一项具体政策，把党的政策交给广大的群众，是基本的组织观念和群众观点。南滚龙沟生产队党支部的同志们深切地懂得这一点，他们不但遇事首先考虑党的政策，而且立即在群众中“亮宝”，把党的政策交给群众。越是经过群众讨论，政策的光芒就越加明亮，把前进的道路照得越是清楚；从生产队到生产小队到每个社员，主动性积极性都大大发扬起来，干劲越来越足，集体主义的思想越来越高。
    在任何地方，政策的法宝一定要“亮”出来，让它们照亮每一个社员的心，照亮每一个偏僻的山村，照亮每一件具体的工作，照亮每一步革命和建设的道路。
