    Persistently Implement "Four Fixes" of Labor, Land, Draft Animals, and Farm Tools
    Establish High-Yield Plots with Production Teams as Units
    A High Tide of Wheat Field Management Appears in the Heping Production Team of Chengguan Commune, Sanyuan County
    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) The Heping Production Team of Chengguan Commune, Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, is vigorously developing high-yield wheat plots by production team, giving full play to the initiative of the teams and enhancing the sense of responsibility of the commune members as masters of their own affairs, resulting in a new look in production management. Currently, the cadres and members of each team in this production team are checking for and treating pests and applying additional fertilizer, and a high tide of management characterized by "wheat management surpassing previous years, with high yields in both small and large plots" is beginning to form.
    Recently, the Heping Production Team, in accordance with the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, led commune members in earnestly studying the Party's policies concerning the management and operation of the people's commune, further recognizing that: taking the production team as the unit for contracted production and vigorously developing high-yield plots by team can better mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, which is conducive to the development of production. Therefore, the team adopted the method of having the teams specifically plan the plots, dividing the 1,960 mu of wheat planted by the entire brigade into high-yield plots according to the specific conditions of various plots, with the largest being 500 mu and the smallest being 60 mu, accounting for 60% of the land.
    In the process of establishing the plots, all six teams insisted on consulting with the commune members, with everyone offering ideas, and formulating the yield increase targets and measures for each high-yield plot from the bottom up. Labor was organized according to the size of the high-yield plot area. After democratic discussion, the vast majority of commune members were clear about the contracted production targets, the amount of investment, the amount of work contracted, the operational measures, and the reward and punishment methods, and they had a clear understanding. Therefore, the area, targets, and measures were quickly implemented, and the wheat seedlings generally grew well. Through this stage of practice, they deeply realized that following the Party's policies and insisting on establishing high-yield plots with the team as the unit has five major benefits:
    1.  Specifically embodies the principles of tiered management and the foundation being the team. The team is the basic unit of the people's commune for organizing production and also the unit for contracted production. Establishing plots with the team can effectively ensure the "four fixes" of labor, land, draft animals, and farm tools, which is conducive to doing a good job in production and winning a bumper harvest.
    2.  The "three guarantees" tasks are implemented quickly, effectively mobilizing the production enthusiasm of commune members. Since the "three guarantees" tasks are determined by the masses through repeated discussions from the bottom up, team cadres and commune members are deeply aware of local production and natural conditions and geographical environment, so the formulated yield increase targets are both advanced and reliable, and various operational measures are also specific and clear. In the management process, each team actively added measures in order to exceed the contracted production target. The third team increased the base fertilizer for each mu of wheat from four large carts to five large carts; the second team applied five large carts of fertilizer to each mu of its 330 mu of wheat, and more than half of it was high-quality fertilizer such as pig manure, sheep manure, and human waste.
    3.  Facilitates planting crops according to local conditions, arranging crop rotations, and better implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Because high-yield plots are managed by the team, the scope is small, and the cadres and commune members are familiar with various local conditions, so dispatching and commanding is appropriate. When planting this autumn, the general practice was to plant early-maturing crops first and plant as they ripened; in terms of arranging crop rotations, they also did things according to local conditions and were handy. The third team had 110 mu of saline-alkali cotton fields that had not been rotated for four years. Some people originally wanted to plant cotton again, but after everyone's discussion, it was decided to rotate the crop and plant wheat, which ensured the quality of planting.
    4.  The spirit of running the farm diligently and frugally has been further implemented. Since the output, investment, and labor of each high-yield plot are all统包统算 (统包统算 means to centrally calculate and manage income and expenses) according to the specific conditions of the team, each team is more careful in planning and calculating and saves investment. For example, the sixth team originally planned to buy 6,000 jin of chemical fertilizer for its more than 300 mu of wheat fields, but after a concentrated fertilizer collection and accumulation campaign, the basic fertilizer needs of each mu of wheat field were met, saving the expense of buying chemical fertilizer. When some small farm tools were damaged, the commune members repaired them themselves, trying not to spend money or spend as little as possible.
    5.  Improved the leadership level of the team cadres and improved their work style. After this discussion on establishing high-yield plots, the relationship between the team cadres and the masses became closer. They worked together in the fields, lived in the canteen, talked about everything, and were able to keep abreast of production conditions and the ideological dynamics of the commune members at any time, so that guiding production and allocating various jobs was practical, and the masses were very satisfied.
    The Heping Production Team has let go and mobilized the commune members to deeply discuss how to manage the high-yield plots well and manage them, fully mobilizing the initiative and enthusiasm of the commune members. After the autumn planting began, under the unified leadership of the production team, they organized red banner competitions and rival competitions between teams and between high-yield plots, and regularly evaluated and exchanged experiences. Party branch secretaries, production team leaders, and other cadres took the lead in setting up command fields in high-yield plots, making themselves both commanders and combatants, and working and laboring together with everyone, greatly promoting the production work of each high-yield plot. At present, on the premise of giving priority to feeding the high-yield plots adequately, the sixth team has prepared more than two large carts of fertilizer for each mu of wheat and has applied a "full moon fertilizer" to all the wheat before the end of November. The fifth team is digging large fertilizer pits in the fields and has organized eight carts and ten strong laborers to rush to transport urban manure fertilizer.

### 坚持执行劳力、土地、耕畜、农具“四固定”  以生产小队为单位建立丰产方  三原县城关公社和平生产队出现小麦田间管理高潮

    坚持执行劳力、土地、耕畜、农具“四固定”
    以生产小队为单位建立丰产方
    三原县城关公社和平生产队出现小麦田间管理高潮
    本报讯　陕西三原县城关公社和平生产队，以小队为单位大搞小麦丰产方，充分发挥小队的主动性，增强社员当家作主的责任感，使生产管理出现了新气象。现在，这个生产队各小队的干部和社员，正在查虫治虫和查肥补肥，一个“小麦管理超往年，小方、大方都高产”的管理高潮开始形成。
    和平生产队最近根据上级党委的指示精神，领导社员认真学习了党的有关人民公社经营管理的方针政策，进一步认识到：以生产小队为包产单位及以小队为单位大搞丰产方，更能调动广大社员大办农业、大办粮食的积极性，有利于发展生产。于是，采取了小队具体规划田块的办法，把全大队种植的一千九百六十亩小麦，根据各类地块的具体情况，能大则大，能小则小，把60％的地都建成了丰产方，最大的五百亩，最小的六十亩。
    在建方的过程中，六个小队都是坚持和社员共同商量，大家出主意，自下而上订出了各个丰产方的增产指标和措施，按丰产方田块的大小，实行劳力编组。经过民主讨论，广大社员对包产指标、投资数量、包工多少、作务措施、奖惩办法等，都一清二楚，胸中有数。因此，面积、指标、措施很快得到落实，建方的进度快，麦苗生长一般良好。通过这个阶段的实践，他们深深体会到按照党的政策办事，坚持以小队为单位办丰产方，共有五大好处：
    一、具体地体现了分级管理、队为基础的原则。小队是人民公社组织生产的基层单位，也是包产单位，以小队建方，才能切实保证劳力、土地、耕畜、农具“四固定”，有利于搞好生产夺取丰收。
    二、“三包”任务落实快，有力地调动了社员生产积极性。由于“三包”任务都是由下而上经群众反复讨论确定，小队干部和社员对当地生产和自然情况、地理环境深知深解，因而制订的增产指标既先进又可靠，各类作务措施也具体明确。在管理过程中，各小队为了超过包产指标，纷纷主动追加措施。三小队每亩麦田底肥由四大车增加到五大车；二小队三百三十亩小麦，不光每亩施了五大车肥，并且一半以上都是猪粪、羊粪和人粪尿等优质肥料。
    三、便于因地制宜种植作物，安排茬口，更好地执行农业“八字宪法”。由于以小队为单位搞丰产方，范围小，干部和社员熟悉当地各种情况，调度指挥恰当。今秋播种时，一般都做到了先熟先种，随熟随种；在安排茬口方面，也是因地制宜，得心应手。三小队有一百一十亩四年没有倒茬的垆土棉花地，原来有人还要种棉花，经过大家讨论，决定倒茬种小麦，倒好了茬口，保证了播种质量。
    四、勤俭办方的精神得到进一步的贯彻。由于各丰产方的产量、投资、投工等，都是按小队具体情况统包统算的，因此各小队更加精打细算，节约投资。如六小队三百多亩小麦地，原来打算买六千斤化肥，结果经过一次搜肥、积肥突击运动后，基本满足了每亩麦田的底肥需要，省下了买化肥的开支。一些小农具损坏了，社员们就自己动手修理，尽量不花钱和少花钱。
    五、提高了小队干部领导水平、改进了作风。经过这次建立丰产方的讨论，小队干部和群众的关系更加密切了，他们一起劳动在田间，生活在食堂，无话不谈，并能随时掌握生产情况和社员思想动态，使指导生产和分配各项活路切合实际，群众十分满意。
    和平生产队放手发动社员深入讨论如何办好丰产方、管好丰产方的措施，充分调动了社员的主动性和积极性。秋种开始后，在生产队的统一领导下，组织小队与小队、丰产方与丰产方之间展开红旗赛和对手赛，定期评比交流经验。党支书、生产队长等干部，以身作则地在丰产方内办了指挥田，使自己既是指挥员，又是战斗员，和大家一起生产劳动，大大推动了各丰产方的生产工作。目前在优先给丰产方吃饱喝足的前提下，六小队给每亩小麦已准备下了二大车以上的肥料，已在11月下旬前给小麦全部追施一次“满月肥”。五小队在地头大挖肥坑，组织了八辆架子车和十名强壮劳力，正在突击拉运城区粪肥。
