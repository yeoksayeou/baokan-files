    Developing Rural Market Trade with Leadership and Planning
    Chen Xing
    Rural market trade in our country is a component of the unified socialist market and a tributary of commodity circulation channels. We should develop rural market trade with leadership and planning to facilitate the exchange and adjustment of commodities produced by the people's communes, production teams, production groups, and members, promote the development of diverse economies in the communes, invigorate the rural economy, and meet some of the daily life and production needs of urban and rural people.
    Production, distribution, exchange, and consumption are an organically linked whole. Production is fundamental, and it determines the distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods; and when the work of commodity circulation and distribution is well done, it also plays an active role in promoting the development of commodity production. After our country basically completed the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, a unified socialist market has been formed. In the sustained great leap forward of the national economy, the vast majority of the purchase and supply of means of production and means of livelihood in urban and rural areas are carried out through the circulation channel of state-owned commerce; only a small portion of small local products and handicrafts are organized for exchange and to adjust surpluses and deficiencies through rural market trade. After the people's communes were established, rural markets underwent some new changes. This change basically adapts to the objective situation of collectivized production and life. First of all, since the scope of production organization has expanded and product distribution is more centralized after the people's communes were established, on the one hand, products of commodity production are centrally sold to state-owned commerce according to plans and contracts; on the other hand, products of self-sufficient production are distributed by the production team according to the principle of distribution according to work. In this way, the commodities originally exchanged through market trade have been greatly reduced. Secondly, the organizational structure and commodity distribution of state-owned commerce have also undergone major innovations to adapt to the new situation and new tasks of the Great Leap Forward in the national economy and the establishment of communes. In terms of commercial organizational forms, production brigades of communes have universally established distribution groups and supply and marketing departments, and canteens have established commission shops. In terms of commodity distribution, the policy of delivering goods to the countryside was implemented, with the main means of production being delivered to the production teams, and non-staple foods and daily necessities being delivered to the public canteens. According to surveys, commercial departments in vast areas of the country supply 80% of the means of production to the countryside to the production teams, and nearly one-third of the daily necessities for commune members are delivered to public canteens. This not only facilitates production teams and commune members, meeting some of their needs for daily necessities, but also gradually reduces the number of people going to markets, enabling the rural people's communes to make reasonable arrangements for labor during busy and slack seasons, which is conducive to the development of agricultural production. Third, for a certain period, the third category of agricultural and sideline products was included in the national plan through the method of holding material exchange meetings from top to bottom, from bottom to top, and combining the top and bottom levels. Management districts (i.e., production brigades) can hold material exchange meetings between production teams, communes can hold material exchange meetings between management districts, and counties can hold material exchange meetings between communes. At the same time, material exchange meetings can also be held within the respective internal parts of sub-districts, communes, and management districts, as well as specialized material exchange meetings. Due to the development of industrial and agricultural production in the people's communes, the planned nature and organization of commodity circulation and the concentration of products have been increasingly strengthened, so rural market trade occupies only a supporting position in the economic life of our country.
    However, this does not mean that rural market trade plays no role. On the contrary, in order to further expand market sources and invigorate the rural economy, it is still necessary to implement the "walking on two legs" policy in the field of commodity circulation, which requires both strengthening the purchase and supply of industrial and agricultural products related to the national economy and the people's livelihood by state-owned commerce, and developing rural market trade with leadership and planning, actively promoting the development of diverse economies of communes, production teams, and production groups, and encouraging commune members to actively develop decentralized household sideline occupations that are not suitable for collective management by production teams and production groups without affecting collective production. At present, the rural people's communes in our country implement a three-level ownership system based on production teams, with the ownership at the production team level being fundamental, the ownership at the commune level being partial, and the production group level also having a small part of the ownership. The production team implements a system of contracted production, contracted work, contracted costs, and rewards for overproduction for the production groups. Under the premise of ensuring the completion of the contracted production tasks, the production groups can also make full use of the edges of fields and other idle land to engage in animal husbandry, forestry, fishery, and other sideline production; commune members can grow vegetables and melons, and engage in small-scale household sideline occupations such as raising pigs, raising sheep, raising chickens, hunting, fishing, and weaving. This part of sideline production and diversified management products provides a broad source of commodities for rural market trade. Through market trade, it is possible to organize communes, production teams, production groups, and commune members to adjust surpluses and deficiencies, expand commodity supply, and reduce the re-handling of certain scattered commodities by state-owned commerce. In this way, production teams, production groups, and commune members can be encouraged to transform these products from self-sufficient production to commodity production. In fact, state-owned commercial departments cannot go door-to-door to purchase the vegetables, melons, and household sideline products produced by the vast number of commune members through scattered production. With market trade, it is possible to gather small amounts into large quantities, which not only facilitates commune members but also promotes production, while also greatly enriching the commodity sources of the market. Secondly, developing rural market trade can not only organically combine the various organizational structures of rural state-owned commerce, but also facilitate the necessary adjustments by state-owned commerce in places where there are too many grass-roots commercial networks and points in certain market towns and production teams. In order to better serve production, state-owned commercial employees must deliver goods to the countryside, serve the public canteens, and further strengthen the relationship between agriculture and commerce, so as to achieve the purpose of serving production and consumption. However, there are still places in the commercial system where the institutions and personnel are too detailed and numerous. Therefore, state-owned commercial departments should try every means to tap labor potential, improve working methods, improve service quality, and save a group of labor. Some market towns and production teams have too many commercial networks and points, which can be appropriately reduced, and some personnel can be squeezed out to engage in agricultural production. Some personnel should be drawn from the state-owned commercial departments to be stationed in the production teams to organize and guide the sideline production of communes, production teams, production groups, and commune members, organize and arrange the people's economic life, and promptly publicize and implement national economic policies. In short, we must truly reduce personnel and do good things.
    Market trade should be developed with leadership and planning. State-owned commerce, grain, banks, taxation, and other departments must form a market management committee with the participation of commune representatives under the leadership of the commune party committee to strengthen the leadership of the market and conduct in-depth publicity of relevant policies to grass-roots cadres and the vast number of commune members. Rural markets are usually organized within the scope of a commune, which is convenient for exchange and leadership. At the same time, production teams, production groups, and commune members should be organized to reasonably arrange time under the premise of not affecting collective production tasks, and mobilize the enthusiasm of auxiliary labor to develop sideline production and diversify management. Communes, production teams, production groups, and individual commune members should be educated that in rural markets, they are only allowed to sell their own products and buy back the goods they need, and are not allowed to resell them for profit. It is necessary to publicize the policy of stabilizing prices, so that the vast masses understand fair trade, equivalent exchange, and do not engage in speculation and profiteering. The focus of policy publicity should be placed on the production groups. It is necessary to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and adopt the working method of the mass line to place market trade activities on the conscious basis of the vast masses, so that it can develop healthily.
    Doing a good job in the management of commodity prices in rural market trade is the central link in developing market trade with leadership and planning. The commodity price of market trade is one of the specific manifestations of the distribution relationship between the collective ownership system and the all-people ownership economy, which is related to national construction and the people's lives. Under the premise of complying with market price stability, for agricultural and sideline products that are uniformly purchased and unified by the state, after completing the state sales tasks, if the commune and production team sell the surplus commodities in the market, they should also be sold to state-owned stores at prices roughly the same as those of state-owned stores; for general local sideline products that are not uniformly purchased and unified by the state, the market management department should stipulate a reasonable price based on historical prices and the price ratios of related commodities; for certain scattered and small local sideline products, if it is not easy to set a price, the buying and selling parties can be organized to negotiate the price temporarily. In short, for each specific commodity, it is necessary to adopt a differentiated approach and flexibly grasp the commodity price of market trade. Under the premise of stabilizing market prices, we must achieve flexibility without chaos and control without rigidity.
    Due to the seasonal differences in rural market trade, the form of market trade, the location of distribution, the interval of market days, and the trading time need to be cleverly arranged according to different seasons. During the busy season of agricultural production in summer and autumn, it is necessary to establish canteen markets for the busy season accordingly, so that the canteen becomes the center of political, economic, and cultural activities. In the peak season of sideline production in winter, the market should be combined with small-scale material exchange meetings. By having commune members go to the market, organizing people to carry goods on the way, and transporting local sideline products, the labor force for short-distance transportation can be saved. At the same time, rural markets should be well combined with the festivals and public holidays of commune members. During each public holiday and festival, rural markets should not only organize buying and selling, but also appropriately organize some necessary cultural activities and sports activities in cooperation with relevant departments, so that commune members can spend their public holidays happily.
    While carrying out commodity trade, rural markets should also actively run some service industries, such as the repair industry (including repairing knives, repairing locks, repairing daily furniture, repairing umbrellas, repairing shoes, renovating and repairing old items, etc.) to meet the needs of the people's economic life. Commercial departments operate these service projects, which not only serve commune members but also save social wealth.

    有领导有计划地开展农村集市贸易
    陈醒
    我国农村集市贸易，是社会主义统一市场的组成部分，是商品流通渠道的一个支渠。我们应该有领导有计划地开展农村集市贸易，以便利人民公社、生产队、生产小队和社员间交换和调剂自己生产的商品，促进公社多种经济的发展，活跃农村经济，满足城乡人民日常生活和生产上的某些需要。
    生产、分配、交换和消费是一个有机联系的整体。生产是根本的，生产决定商品的分配、交换和消费；而商品流通和分配工作做得好，对商品生产的发展，也起着积极促进的作用。在我国基本上完成对私营工商业的社会主义改造后，已经形成了统一的社会主义市场。在国民经济持续跃进中，城乡生产资料和生活资料的收购、供应工作，绝大部分都是经过国营商业这条流通渠道；只有一小部分小土产品、手工业品要通过农村集市贸易来组织交流，调剂有无。人民公社化后，农村集市有了一些新的变化。这个变化基本上是适应生产和生活集体化的客观形势发展的。首先，由于人民公社化后生产组织的范围扩大了，产品分配也较集中，所以一方面，商品性生产的产品，实行按计划、按合同集中交售给国营商业；另一方面，自给性生产的产品，通过生产队根据按劳分配的原则进行分配。这样，原来通过集市贸易进行交换的商品就大大减少了。其次，国营商业的组织机构和商品分配，适应国民经济大跃进和公社化的新形势、新任务，也进行了重大的革新。在商业组织形式方面，公社的生产大队普遍建立了分销组和供销部，公共食堂里建立了代销店。在商品分配上，贯彻了送货下乡，把主要生产资料送到生产队，把副食品、生活日用品送到公共食堂。据调查，全国广大地区的商业部门供应给农村的生产资料，有80％送到生产队，社员的生活日用品送到公共食堂的也近三分之一。这样，既便利了生产队和社员群众，满足了他们对生活日用必需品的一些需要，又逐步减少赶集的人数，使农村人民公社在农忙和农闲时，能够对劳动力进行合理安排，有利于农业生产的发展。第三，在一定时期内，通过由上到下，由下到上，上下结合，逐级召开物资交流会的方法，把农副产品的第三类物资纳入国家计划。管理区（即生产大队）一级可以召开生产小队之间的物资交流会，公社一级可以召开管理区之间的物资交流会，县一级可以召开公社之间的物资交流会。同时，也可以召开分片、公社、管理区各自内部的物资交流会和专业物资交流会。由于人民公社工农业生产的发展，商品流通的计划性、组织性和产品的集中日益加强，所以农村集市贸易在我国的经济生活领域里，只居于一个辅助地位。
    但是，这并不等于说农村集市贸易就不起什么作用了。相反的，为了进一步地扩大市场货源，活跃农村经济，还有必要在商品流通领域里贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，既要加强国营商业对有关国计民生的工农业产品的收购和供应，也要有领导有计划地开展农村集市贸易，积极地促进公社、生产队和生产小队的多种经济的发展，以及在不影响集体生产的条件下，鼓励社员积极发展那些不便于生产队和生产小队集体经营的分散的家庭副业。目前，我国农村人民公社实行以生产队为基础的三级所有制，生产队一级的所有权是基本的，公社一级的所有权是部分的，生产小队一级也有小部分的所有权。生产队对生产小队实行包产、包工、包成本和超产奖励制度。生产小队在保证完成包产任务的前提下，还可以充分利用田边地角和其他闲散的土地，经营牧业、林业、渔业和其他副业生产；社员可以种菜、种瓜，经营养猪、养羊、养鸡、打猎、捕鱼、编织等等小规模的家庭副业。这一部分的副业生产和多种经营的产品，为农村集市贸易提供了广阔的商品货源。通过集市贸易，就可以组织公社、生产队、生产小队和社员之间调剂有无，扩大商品供应，并减少国营商业对某些零星商品的转手经营。这样，可以鼓励生产队、生产小队和社员把这些产品由自给性的生产变为商品性的生产。事实上，广大社员分散生产的菜、瓜和家庭副业产品，国营商业部门也不可能挨家挨户的去收购。有了集市贸易，就可以集点滴为大宗，既便利了社员，又促进了生产，同时，也大大充实了市场的商品货源。其次，开展农村集市贸易，既能够使农村国营商业的各个组织机构做到有机的结合，也便于国营商业对某些集镇和生产队的基层商业网、点过多的地方，进行必要的调整。国营商业职工为了更好地服务于生产，要送货下乡，服务到公共食堂，进一步地密切农商之间的关系，达到为生产为消费服务的目的。但在商业系统也还存在着机构、人员过细过多的地方。因此，国营商业部门应该想尽一切办法，挖掘劳动潜力，改进工作方法，提高服务质量，节省出一批劳动力。某些集镇和生产队的商业网、点过多，可适当地减少些，挤出一部分人员来从事农业生产。要从国营商业部门抽出一部分人员到生产队去驻队，组织和指导公社、生产队和生产小队以及社员的副业生产，组织安排人民经济生活，并及时地宣传和贯彻国家经济政策。总之，真正做到减人办好事。
    集市贸易要有领导有计划地开展。国营商业、粮食、银行、税收等部门必须在公社党委领导下，组成有公社代表参加的集市管理委员会，加强对集市的领导，深入向基层干部和广大社员进行有关政策的宣传。农村集市通常是在一个公社范围内组织，既便于交流，也便于领导。同时要组织生产队、生产小队和社员在不影响集体生产任务的前提下，合理安排时间，并调动辅助劳动力的积极性，开展副业生产，发展多种经营。要教育公社、生产队和生产小队以及社员个人，在农村集市上，都只许出卖自己生产的商品，买回自己需要的商品，不许倒手转卖，从中赚钱。要宣传稳定物价的政策，让广大群众懂得公平交易，等价交换，不投机倒把。要把政策宣传工作的重点放在生产小队。要依靠群众，发动群众，采取群众路线的工作方法，把集市贸易活动置于广大群众自觉的基础上，使之健康地发展。
    作好农村集市贸易的商品价格的管理，是有领导有计划地开展集市贸易工作的中心环节。集市贸易的商品价格，是集体所有制与全民所有制经济之间的分配关系的具体表现形式之一，它关系着国家建设和人民的生活。在服从市场物价稳定的前提下，凡是国家统购和统一收购的农副产品，在完成国家交售任务后，公社和生产队的多余的商品如果在集市上出售时，也要以和国营商店牌价大体相同的价格向国营商店出售；凡不是国家统购和统一收购的一般土副产品，由集市管理部门根据历史价格和有关商品的比价规定一个合理的价格；某些零星细小的土副产品，如果不好定价时，可以组织买卖双方临时议价。总之，对待每项具体商品，要采取分别对待，灵活地掌握集市贸易的商品价格。在稳定市场物价的前提下，做到活而不乱，管而不死。
    由于农村集市贸易季节差别的存在，集市贸易的形式、集散地点、集期间隔和交易时间，需要按照不同季节，巧作安排。在夏秋农业生产大忙季节，要相应地建立农忙的食堂集市，使食堂成为政治、经济、文化活动的中心。在冬季副业生产的旺季，要把集市和小型物资交流会结合起来，通过社员赶集，组织捎脚，运送土副产品，这样可以节约短途运输的劳动力。同时，农村集市要同群众习惯的节日和社员公休假日很好地结合起来，每逢公休、节日期间，农村集市不仅要组织有买有卖，而且还应该配合有关部门适当地组织某些必要的文化活动和体育活动，使社员群众愉快地度过公休假日。
    农村集市在开展商品贸易的同时，还要积极地办一些服务性的行业，如修补行业（包括修剪刀、修锁、修理日常家具、补伞、补鞋、翻新补旧等），以满足人民经济生活方面的需要。商业部门经营这些服务项目，既为社员群众服务，又节约了社会财富。
