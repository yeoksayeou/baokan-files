    Actively Build Agricultural Machinery Repair and Assembly Network

    To accelerate agricultural technical transformation, it is necessary to establish an agricultural machinery repair and assembly network in a timely manner. In some areas that started earlier, such as Heilongjiang and Liaoning, agricultural machinery repair and assembly networks have already taken shape and are beginning to play an increasingly significant role in agricultural technical transformation. The agricultural machinery repair and assembly network is a rationally distributed agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair industrial system within the scope of the county and people's commune, and its task is to serve agricultural mechanization and water conservancy locally. Before cooperativization, there was no mechanical industry in China's rural areas. For thousands of years, the manufacture and repair of small farm tools relied on blacksmiths and carpenters in rural areas, and large farm tools were supplied by urban handicrafts. The distribution of rural and urban handicrafts was very unreasonable. Farmers often had to travel a long way and spend a lot of time to repair a farm tool. After cooperativization, rural handicrafts began to be organized. After the establishment of rural people's communes, rural handicraft organizations began to form an industrial sector of the commune. At the same time, a number of small agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing plants were newly built or expanded in the counties and communes, becoming the first batch of mechanical industries to appear in rural areas. However, due to the short construction time and uneven development, these factories cannot fully meet the growing needs of agricultural technical transformation. We should expand the existing agricultural machinery repair and assembly enterprises in a planned way, and gradually build a relatively sound agricultural machinery repair and assembly network with the county and people's commune as units.

    Regional agricultural machinery repair and assembly networks should undertake two tasks: one is to manufacture various farm tools and some simple agricultural machinery, and the other is to repair agricultural machinery and farm tools. The more developed the agricultural technical transformation, the more arduous these two tasks will be. In the past few years, thousands of new farm tools have been created in the tool reform movement. In order to promote new farm tools more widely, it is necessary to step up manufacturing and repair them in a timely manner. At present, the farm tools in rural areas, including the new farm tools produced in the tool reform movement, are mainly wooden or iron-wood mixed farm tools; such farm tools are relatively easy to damage, and if they are not repaired in time, they cannot give full play to their role. With a sound agricultural machinery repair and assembly network, these two tasks can be solved. It can be said that the construction of an agricultural machinery repair and assembly network is an important guarantee for consolidating and developing the achievements of tool reform.

    From the perspective of realizing agricultural mechanization, it is even more necessary to accelerate the construction of agricultural machinery repair and assembly networks. Whether a large number of agricultural machines can take root in rural areas depends not only on whether rural areas can use them, but also on whether rural areas can repair and assemble them. The utilization rate of tractors and irrigation and drainage machinery in some places is not high, and some machines cannot even be started all year round. One of the main reasons is that the repair and assembly work cannot keep up: if the machine is broken, it cannot be repaired in time; if the parts are worn, they cannot be made in time. In order to accelerate agricultural technical transformation, the state is supplying more and more modern machinery to rural areas, such as tractors, irrigation and drainage machinery, farming machinery, and automobiles. This requires us to build an agricultural machinery repair and assembly network in a timely manner that is adapted to the increase in agricultural machinery, and to rapidly improve the repair and assembly capacity of agricultural machinery. This is an important condition for giving full play to the power of agricultural machinery and improving the utilization rate of agricultural machinery. After the communization of the Bengbu Special Zone in Anhui Province, the number of tractors increased to 690 standard units, and the number of irrigation and drainage machinery increased to 3,301 units. However, due to the weak mechanical repair capacity, untimely mechanical maintenance, and lack of accessories, more than one-third of the machinery could not be used frequently. This year, the counties and communes in this special zone have vigorously established mechanical repair organizations, and the utilization rate of agricultural machinery has been significantly improved. The tractor turnout rate in Suxian County in the first half of this year has increased from about 60% in the past to more than 95%; in the past, the average arable land of each standard tractor in the county was 6,000 mu, and this year it reached about 5,000 mu in the first half of the year alone. Wendeng County, Shandong Province, has basically built an agricultural machinery repair and assembly network this year. Due to timely mechanical repair, the mechanical utilization rate has reached 72%, an increase of 68% over the same period last year. Agricultural machinery has played a significant role in the busy summer harvest and summer planting.

    The construction of an agricultural machinery repair and assembly network in a region is related to the industrial layout of the county and the people's commune. Therefore, it should be comprehensively planned and rationally arranged. Each county and people's commune should comprehensively arrange various repair and assembly enterprises according to its own agricultural technical transformation requirements. On the one hand, it should strive to improve the production capacity of these repair and assembly enterprises, and on the other hand, it should pay attention to the rational layout of production capacity, so that repair and assembly plants and repair and assembly stations (groups) can divide labor and cooperate closely, and gradually achieve "major repairs do not leave the county, medium repairs do not leave the commune, and minor repairs do not leave the team."

    At present, the agricultural machinery repair and assembly network in the vast rural areas has not been universally established, and some have been established, but the repair and assembly capacity is not high. Under this circumstance, urban industrial enterprises should be organized to repair and assemble agricultural machinery for rural areas in a planned way. This year, Beijing has helped the people's communes in the suburbs to establish agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants, and has organized a large number of urban industrial enterprises to participate in agricultural machinery repair and assembly work. Since the beginning of autumn, it has repaired a large number of wheat seeders, power threshers, and tractors, which has greatly promoted the "three autumn" work.

    The universal establishment of an agricultural machinery repair and assembly industrial system in the vast rural areas of the country is a large-scale capital construction and cannot be achieved overnight. We must proceed from reality, make the most of what we have, operate diligently and thriftily, implement the "walking on two legs" policy, use local methods where possible, use foreign methods where possible, combine local and foreign methods, develop from small to large, from rough to refined, and gradually improve. In the process of building agricultural machinery repair and assembly enterprises, some places have actively used and refitted discarded machines, manufactured machines by local methods, and produced useful local machine tools and semi-local and semi-foreign machine tools to arm their agricultural machinery repair and assembly industry; this practice should be greatly encouraged. In the process of building a factory, the Gaocheng County Tractor Repair and Assembly Plant in Hebei Province mobilized its employees to work hard and painstakingly research and develop machines and tools such as cylinder boring machines, high-pressure oil pump test benches, electrical discharge machining machines, and electric planers using local methods. In less than half a year, the production capacity increased by 60%, and the degree of mechanization was also greatly improved.

    Strengthening the support of urban industry to rural areas is one of the important conditions for the successful construction of an agricultural machinery repair and assembly network. In the process of accelerating agricultural development and accelerating the realization of agricultural technical transformation, urban industry can provide rural areas with assistance in many aspects. Under the current circumstances, helping rural areas build agricultural machinery repair and assembly networks should become one of the main tasks of industrial support for agriculture. Urban leading organs should organize urban industrial enterprises through "factory-commune linkage" and other effective forms, and provide rural areas with strong support in the manufacture and installation of equipment, and in the training and cultivation of technical forces, to help rural areas overcome various material and technical difficulties, so that rural areas can build a relatively sound agricultural machinery repair and assembly network in as short a period as possible. The mechanical equipment and other materials supported by the industrial sector to rural areas should be considered as a whole by the higher-level leading organs according to the state's unified distribution plan, so that industrial support for agricultural technical transformation can be more organized, led, and planned, and can be more effective.

    积极建设农业机具修配网
    为了加速农业技术改造，必须把农业机具修配网及时建立起来。有些动手较早的地区，像黑龙江、辽宁等地区，农业机具修配网已经粗具规模，开始在农业技术改造中发挥日益显著的作用。农业机具修配网，是县和人民公社范围内的合理布局的农业机具制造、修配工业体系，它的任务是就地为农业机械化、水利化服务。在合作化以前，我国农村中完全没有机械工业。千百年来，小农具的制造和修理，一直依靠农村中的铁匠和木匠，大农具由城镇手工业供应。农村、城镇手工业的分布很不合理，农民为了修理一件农具，往往要跑很多路，要费很多时间。合作化以后，农村手工业开始组织起来。农村人民公社建立以后，农村手工业组织开始形成公社的一个工业部门。与此同时，各地又在县和公社的范围内新建或扩建了一批小型农业机具修造厂，成为农村中出现的第一批机械工业。但是，由于建厂时间很短，发展又不平衡，这些工厂还不能充分满足农业技术改造日益增长的需要。我们应当有步骤地扩充现有的农业机具修配企业，以县和人民公社为单位，逐步建成比较健全的农业机具修配网。
    地区性的农业机具修配网应当担负两个任务：一是制造各种农具和部分简易的农业机械，一是修理农业机械和农具。农业技术改造工作越发展，这两方面的任务就越繁重。几年来，在工具改革运动中，已经创造了成千上万种新农具。为了更广泛推广新农具，既要加紧制造，又要及时修理。目前农村中的农具，包括工具改革运动中产生的新式农具，主要是木制或铁木混制的农具；这样的农具比较容易损坏，如不及时修理，就不能充分发挥作用。有了健全的农业机具修配网，这两方面的任务就解决了。可以说，建设农业机具修配网，是巩固和发展工具改革成果的重要保证。
    从实现农业机械化的要求来看，更要加速建设农业机具修配网。大量农业机器能不能在农村生根，不但决定于农村会不会使用，而且决定于农村会不会修配。有些地方的拖拉机和排灌机械的利用率不高，部分机器甚至常年不能开动，主要原因之一就是修配工作跟不上：机器坏了，不能及时检修；零件磨损了，不能及时配制。为了加速农业技术改造，国家供应农村的拖拉机、排灌机械、耕作机械、汽车等现代化机械越来越多，这就要求我们及时建设一个与农业机械的增长相适应的农业机具修配网，迅速提高农业机械的修配能力。这是充分发挥农业机械的威力、提高农业机械的利用率的一个重要条件。安徽蚌埠专区公社化后，拖拉机增加到六百九十个标准台，排灌机械增加到三千三百零一台，但是因为机械修配能力薄弱，机械维修不及时，配件缺乏，有三分之一以上的机械经常不能使用。今年，这个专区各县各社大力建立机械修配组织，农业机械的利用率显著提高。宿县的拖拉机出车率今年上半年已由过去的60％左右提高到95％以上；过去全县拖拉机每个标准台平均耕地六千亩，今年仅上半年就达到五千亩左右。山东省文登县今年基本上建成了农业机具修配网，由于机械修配及时，机械利用率已经达到72％，比去年同期提高了68％，农业机械在紧张的夏收夏种中发挥了显著的作用。
    一个地区的农业机具修配网的建设，关系到县和人民公社的工业布局，因此，应该全面规划、合理安排。各县和人民公社应当根据自己的农业技术改造的要求，全面安排各项修配企业，一方面要努力提高这些修配企业的生产能力，一方面要注意生产能力的合理布局，使修配厂、修配站（组）能分工协作，密切配合，逐步做到农业机具“大修不出县，中修不出社，小修不出队”。
    目前，广大农村的农业机具修配网还没有普遍建立，有的虽已建立，但修配能力还不高。在这种情况下，应当有计划地组织城市工业企业为农村修配农业机具。北京市今年一面帮助郊区人民公社建立农业机具修配厂，一面组织大批城市工业企业参加农业机械修配工作；入秋以来修好了大批小麦播种机、动力脱谷机、拖拉机，对于“三秋”工作起了很大的推动作用。
    在全国广大农村中普遍建立农业机具修配工业体系，是一项规模巨大的基本建设，不能要求一蹴而成。必须从实际出发，因陋就简，勤俭经营，贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，能土就土，能洋就洋，土洋结合，由小到大，由粗到精，逐步提高。有些地方在建设农业机具修配企业的过程中，积极利用和改装废旧机器，用土法制造机器，制出了有用的土机床和半土半洋的机床，武装了自己的农业机具修配工业；这种做法应当大加提倡。河北藁城县拖拉机修配厂在建厂过程中，发动职工刻苦钻研，用土法制成了搪缸机、高压油泵试验台、电火花加工机、电刨等机械和工具，不到半年的时间，生产能力提高了60％，机械化程度也大大提高。
    加强城市工业对农村的支援，是顺利建成农业机具修配网的重要条件之一。在加速发展农业的过程中，在加速实现农业技术改造的过程中，城市工业可以给予农村以多方面的帮助。在目前情况下，帮助农村建成农业机具修配网，应当成为工业支援农业的主要工作之一。城市领导机关应当通过“厂社挂勾”和其他有效的形式，把城市工业企业组织起来，在设备的制造和安装方面，在技术力量的训练和培养方面，给农村以有力的支援，帮助农村克服各种物资和技术的困难，使农村在尽可能短的时期内建成比较健全的农业机具修配网。工业部门支援农村的机械设备和其他物资，应当由上级领导机关根据国家统一分配计划全盘考虑，使得工业支援农业技术改造，作到更加有组织、有领导、有计划，作到更有成效。
