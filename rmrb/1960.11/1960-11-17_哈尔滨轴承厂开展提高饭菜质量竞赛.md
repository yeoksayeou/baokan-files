The leading cadres of Harbin Bearing Factory went deep into reality, starting with grasping the life of the workers, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers and promoted the production upsurge to move forward wave after wave.

The factory's Party committee, based on the problems discovered by the leading cadres in the process of going deep into the canteens, made a decision to democratically manage the canteens, decentralizing the canteens to the workshops and drawing cadres from each workshop to enrich the leadership of the canteens. Democratic management committees were generally established in the canteens, absorbing workers to participate in management. At the same time, a "Ten Goods" competition was organized among all canteens in the factory, centered on the staple and non-staple food processing stations ("Good" at studying Chairman Mao's writings, "Good" at technical innovation, "Good" at diligence and thrift, "Good" at service attitude, "Good" at adjusting food quality, "Good" at democratic management, "Good" at unity, mutual assistance and collaboration, "Good" at cleanliness and hygiene, "Good" at abiding by various systems, "Good" at propaganda). Through the competition, further promote the proper running of the canteens by each unit. Leading cadres of the machine repair, bar stock, forging, and trial manufacturing workshops go to the canteen every day to participate in selling food and check the quality of the food, and solve problems in a timely manner when they are discovered.

After the leading cadres went deep into the canteens, they paid special attention to grasping the technical innovation and technical revolution of the canteens. At present, the eight canteens in the factory have made ten kinds of mechanical equipment, including automatic pancake grilling lines, noodle pressing machines, and vegetable cutting machines, totaling more than twenty units, which have basically realized the mechanization of the canteen work.
