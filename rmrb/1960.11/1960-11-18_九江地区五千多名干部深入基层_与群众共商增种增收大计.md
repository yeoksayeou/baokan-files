    Over 5,000 Cadres in Jiujiang Region Go Deep into Grassroots
    Discussing Plans for Increasing Planting and Income with the Masses
    Interplanting and Mixed Cropping, Reclaiming Wasteland, 170,000 Mu of Winter Crops Already Planted
    Repeated Harvesting and Threshing, Vigorous "Small Autumn Harvest," Increasing Grain Income by Over 1 Million Jin
    (This Jin is an old Chinese measurement, 1 jin equals 0.5 kg or 1.1 lbs)

    (Reported by our newspaper) The "Three Increases and Three Surpasses" movement launched in the Jiujiang region of Jiangxi Province is in full swing. As early as September, the Jiujiang Prefectural Party Committee put forward the "Three Increases and Three Surpasses" production increase and economization campaign to Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of farmers throughout the region. "Three Increases" means: by next spring, each person will increase the income of a certain amount of grain, livestock feed, and sideline income; "Three Surpasses" means production surpasses the plan, labor surpasses the quota, and laggards surpass the advanced.
    In order to ensure the rapid development of the "Three Increases and Three Surpasses" movement, 5,600 cadres were drawn from the three levels of prefecture, county, and commune to form 1,820 work teams, which went deep into the grassroots of communes and teams. The main responsible comrades of the prefectural and county committees went to the backward communes and brigades to discuss with the masses the potential for increasing production, and led the masses to work hard and quickly catch up with the advanced. When Wu Ping, the First Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee, went to the Yangliu Brigade's Fourth Team of Chengmen Commune in Jiujiang City to study ways to increase production with the masses, he discovered two experiences in expanding the replanting area: interplanting wheat and rapeseed in radish vegetable fields; planting rapeseed and barley in rotten mud fields. He summarized three benefits: first, it can increase grain production; second, it can increase vegetable production; and third, it can increase green manure for next year. After summarizing and promoting it, a interplanting movement was quickly launched throughout the commune, and the interplanting area was expanded by more than 30% compared with the original plan. The experience of this commune was quickly spread throughout the region. According to statistics from six counties including Duchang, Ruichang, Hukou, Yongxiu, Wuning, and Dean, more than 115,500 mu of wheat were interplanted in radish vegetable fields, and more than 83,100 mu of green manure were interplanted, which greatly increased the winter planting index of the entire region.
    In the "Three Increases and Three Surpasses" movement, the policy of combining work and rest was conscientiously implemented. On the day of the holiday on November 5th in Jiujiang Chengmen Commune, the commune members rested while handling personal affairs. More than 30 women from the Second Team of Qilin Brigade went to the lake island together on their day off and had a good time for half a day, and each of them picked more than 50 jin of wild plants.
    Through the comprehensive implementation of policies, a situation has emerged everywhere where everyone works full attendance and everyone exceeds the quota. At present, the daily progress of harvesting and planting in the region has reached more than 135,000 mu, which is more than twice as fast as the same period last year.
    In order to surpass the plan in production, all localities have tried every means to expand planting. In addition to ensuring that all the original cultivated land is planted in winter, the entire region has newly reclaimed more than 244,800 mu of wasteland, including 153,800 mu of land reclaimed from lake islands. More than 81,100 mu of scattered wasteland has been reclaimed, and more than 9,600 mu of intercropping of forests and grains has been carried out. At present, various winter crops (mainly grain crops) have been planted on more than 175,600 mu. At the same time, interplanting is carried out on a large scale in radish fields, so that no plot is idle and two harvests are reaped in one season.
    While vigorously expanding planting, a campaign of repeated harvesting and threshing and "small autumn harvest" was launched. At present, the region has recovered more than 1 million jin of grain and 6,436 dan of various industrial raw materials through repeated harvesting and threshing, going up mountains to pick, and going down into the water to collect.
     (This Dan is also an old chinese measurement. It varies depending on what is being measured but is around 50kg or 110 lbs)

### 九江地区五千多名干部深入基层  与群众共商增种增收大计

    九江地区五千多名干部深入基层
    与群众共商增种增收大计
    套种间种，开垦荒地，已种越冬作物十七万亩
    复收复打，大搞“小秋收”，增收粮食百余万斤
    本报讯　江西省九江地区展开的“三增三超”运动轰轰烈烈。远在9月间，中共九江地委就向全区各级党的组织和广大农民群众，提出了开展“三增三超”的增产节约运动。“三增”是：到明春止，每人增收一定数量的粮食、牲畜饲料和副业收入；“三超”是生产超计划，劳动超定额，后进超先进。
    为了保证“三增三超”运动的迅速开展，从专、县、社三级抽调了五千六百名干部，组成了一千八百二十个工作组，分别深入到社、队基层。地、县委的主要负责同志，分别下到后进的公社、大队，与群众共谋增产潜力，领导群众发愤图强，迅速向先进看齐。地委第一书记吴平同志深入到九江市城门公社杨柳大队第四小队与群众共同研究增产门路时，发现两条扩大复种面积的经验：即萝卜菜地里套种三麦、油菜；烂泥田里种油菜和大麦。并总结了三条好处：一可增产粮食，二可增产蔬菜，三可为明年增加绿肥。经过总结推广，迅速在全社范围内掀起了套种运动，套种面积较原计划扩大30％以上。这个公社的经验很快被传播到全区各地。据都昌、瑞昌、湖口、永修、武宁、德安等六个县的统计，在萝卜菜地里套种三麦达十一万五千五百多亩，套种绿肥八万三千一百多亩，大大增加了全区的冬种指数。
    在“三增三超”的运动中，认真贯彻执行了劳逸结合的政策。九江城门公社11月5日放假的那天，社员们一边休息，一边处理私人的事务。其林大队二小队三十多个妇女在休息日一齐走向湖洲，痛痛快快地玩了半天，每人还顺手采摘了五十多斤野生植物。
    通过全面贯彻政策，到处出现人人出满勤，个个超定额的局面。目前全区收种日进度达十三万五千多亩，较去年同期加快一倍多。
    为了生产超计划，各地千方百计地大搞扩种。除保证原耕土地全部冬种以外，全区已新开荒二十四万四千八百余亩，其中围垦湖洲十五万三千八百亩。零星开荒八万一千余亩，林粮间作九千六百余亩。目前已种上了各种越冬作物（主要是粮食作物）十七万五千六百余亩。同时在萝卜田里大搞套种，做到一丘不空闲，一季两丰收。
    在大搞扩种的同时，开展了复收复打和“小秋收”运动。目前全区通过复收复打，上山摘，下水采，收入粮食一百余万斤，各种工业原料六千四百三十六担。
