    Further Strengthen Ties Between Cadres and the Masses
    Anding Commune Launches "Five Same As" Campaign
    Requiring Cadres to Share Weal and Woe with the Masses in Production and Life, Without Any Special Privileges, and to Take the Lead in Thought and Work in All Aspects
    (Our Newspaper News) The cadres of Anding Commune in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, based on the comprehensive implementation of the "Two-Five" system of leadership and "Four Togethers," have universally launched a "Five Same As" campaign with commune members: "Eating and living the same, laboring the same, evaluating work points the same, receiving wages the same, and family treatment the same." The development of this campaign has further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses, mobilized the political enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses, and promoted the production increase and frugality campaign centered on grain.
    Since the rectification and commune reorganization last winter and this spring, the cadres of this commune have generally adhered to participating in production and leading production. Especially after the implementation of the "Two-Five" system of leadership, cadres at all levels have participated in labor more frequently. According to statistics, the labor work points of more than 2,000 cadres above the team leader level in the entire commune have averaged more than 2,100 this year, an increase of 32% compared with the same period last year. In production, the vast majority of them can closely connect with the masses and have received good reviews. However, there are also a few cadres who do not participate in production frequently enough, or who, although they participate in production, neglect leading production. Some cadres participate in production themselves but fail to mobilize their families to participate in production. Although these are individual phenomena, they have affected the relationship between cadres and the masses and the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members to varying degrees. In order to solve these problems, the Party branch of the Daqiao production team of the Daqiao brigade of this commune first proposed a competition campaign among cadres in July this year to be "Three Same As" with commune members (namely: laboring the same, eating and living the same, and family participation in production the same as commune members), which has been very effective. Zhang Ningxiang, First Secretary of the Pingjiang County Party Committee, after discovering this experience, summarized and improved it, adding some new content. Thus, the "Five Same As" campaign was universally launched in Anding Commune and the entire county.
    Because the "Five Same As" campaign puts forward specific requirements for each cadre's eating, living, labor, scoring, distribution... it greatly promotes cadres to go deep into the groups and fields, take root, and makes the realization of the "Two-Five" system of leadership more guaranteed. Since the launch of the campaign, more than 1,000 brigade and production team cadres throughout the commune, except for the brigade general branch secretaries and production team branch secretaries who both stay at a point and rotate, have mostly taken root in one group or one canteen. Wu Yousheng, secretary of the Shuangkou team branch, did not participate in labor frequently in the past. The masses had opinions about him. After Wu Yousheng improved his work style in the campaign, he worked with the commune members every day, taking on heavy work and taking the lead, becoming one of the four high-efficiency pacesetters in the team.
    In order to correctly carry out the "Five Same As" campaign for cadres and commune members, the Anding Commune Party Committee has firmly grasped the following links: First, strengthen ideological education for cadres, continuously summarize the experience of the campaign, and help cadres consciously implement this system. Before the launch of the campaign, the Commune Party Committee organized all cadres to conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's relevant works and the relevant instructions of the Party Central Committee, and combined with the situation and experience of the Daqiao Brigade, conducted discussions. After the campaign was launched, the entire commune was divided into four competition zones, controlled by the four deputy secretaries of the Commune Party Committee, and a comparison competition was conducted every half month. Through comparisons, experiences were continuously summarized, advanced banners were established, and cadres' ideological understanding was improved. Zeng Xingsheng, secretary of the Nanbo production team branch of the Feitian Brigade, was initially afraid that implementing the "Five Same As" would affect his work. His actions were not very active; after two comparisons, he found that Yu Yingzhou, secretary of the Zhuduan production team branch, had twice as many labor work points as him, and his work was also better. His ideological concerns were completely dispelled. Due to meticulous and in-depth ideological education, more than 90% of the cadres in the entire commune have implemented the "Five Same As" regulations.
    Secondly, the provisions of the "Five Same As" must be flexibly grasped, and different requirements must be put forward for different cadres. The specific regulations of the "Five Same As" by the Commune Party Committee are: (1) Eating and living the same: Cadres' rations are the same as those of commune members, with equal grades and quantities, meals are opened with tickets, meals are eaten at the same table, and the same pot of dishes is used; all live in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. (2) Laboring the same: Every non-detached cadre, like the commune members, arranges work, evaluates basic points, sets production quotas, and subsidizes missed work due to public affairs. Detached and semi-detached cadres above the brigade general branch secretaries participate in production for five days and work and study for two days in accordance with the "Two-Five" system; (3) Evaluating work points the same: Cadres participating in labor evaluate work points together with commune members according to quotas and labor efficiency, record them in the labor manual, and check them once a month. (4) Receiving wages the same: Non-detached cadres, like commune members, receive wages regularly according to their labor, and abolish temporary advances; (5) Family treatment the same: Cadres' family members participate in agricultural production according to their labor strength, technical level, and living conditions should not be special.
    Third, while promoting the "Five Same As," it is also necessary to educate each cadre to share weal and woe with the masses in labor and life, without any special privileges; and in thought and work, they must not be satisfied with being the same as the masses, but must be ahead of the masses and lead the masses forward.

    进一步密切干部同群众的关系
    安定公社开展“五个一样”运动
    要求干部在生产和生活上和群众同甘共苦毫不特殊，在思想和工作上处处带头走在前边
    本报讯　湖南省平江县安定公社的干部，在全面推行“二五”制领导方法和“四同”的基础上，普遍开展了同社员“吃住一个样、劳动一个样、评工计分一个样、发工资一个样、家属待遇一个样”的“五个一样”运动。这一运动的开展，进一步密切了党与群众的关系，调动了广大群众的政治热情和生产积极性，推动了以粮食为中心的增产节约运动。
    这个公社的干部，自去冬今春整风整社以后，一般都坚持了参加生产，领导生产。特别是实行“二五”制领导方法以后，各级干部参加劳动更为经常。据统计，全社两千多个作业组长以上的干部，今年以来的劳动工分每人平均达到两千一百多分，与去年同期比较，增加了32％。他们在生产中，绝大多数都能密切联系群众，受到好评。但是，也有少数干部参加生产不够经常，或者虽然参加了生产，却忽视了领导生产。有些干部自己参加生产，没有动员家属参加生产。这些虽是个别现象，但却不同程度地影响到干群关系和广大社员的生产积极性。这个公社的大桥大队大桥生产队党支部，为了解决这些问题，于今年7月间首先提出在干部中间开展和社员“三个一样”的竞赛运动（即：劳动一个样，吃住一个样，家属参加生产和社员一个样），收效很好。平江县委第一书记张凝祥发现这个经验后，经过总结提高，增加了一些新的内容，于是“五个一样”运动，就在安定公社和全县普遍开展起来。
    由于“五个一样”运动对每个干部吃、住、劳动、记分、分配……都提出了具体要求，大大促进了干部必须深入到组到田，生根落脚，使“二五”制领导方法的实现更有保证。运动开展以来，全社一千多名大队和生产队干部除大队总支书记和生产队支部书记既蹲点又转面以外，大部分都在一个组或一个食堂扎下了根。爽口中队支部书记吴有生，过去参加劳动不经常。群众对他有意见。吴有生在运动中改进作风以后，天天和社员一起劳动，并且抢重活，出头工，成为全队四个高工效标兵之一。
    为了正确地开展干部社员“五个一样”运动，安定公社党委紧紧掌握了以下几个环节：首先是加强对干部的思想教育，不断地总结运动的经验，帮助干部自觉地执行这个制度。在运动开展前，公社党委组织全体干部认真学习了毛泽东同志的有关著作和党中央的有关指示，并结合大桥大队的情况和经验，进行了讨论。运动开展后，又在全社划分了四个竞赛区，由公社党委四个副书记掌握，每半月开展一次评比竞赛。通过评比，不断总结经验，树立先进旗帜，提高干部思想认识。肥田大队南波生产队支部书记曾行生，开始怕贯彻“五个一样”会影响工作。行动不大积极；经过两次评比，他发现朱塅生产队支部书记余应周，劳动工分比他多一倍，而工作也比他搞得更好，思想顾虑便完全解除。由于思想教育细致深入，全社90％以上的干部，都执行了“五个一样”的规定。
    其次，对“五个一样”的规定，必须灵活掌握，对不同干部提出不同要求。公社党委对“五个一样”的具体规定是：（1）吃住一个样：干部的口粮，都同社员一样按等定量，凭票开餐，同桌吃饭，同一锅菜；都住在贫农和下中农家里。（2）劳动一个样：每个非脱产干部，都和社员一样排工，评定底分，定额生产，因公误工补贴。大队总支书记以上的脱产和半脱产干部，则按“二五制”的规定，五天参加生产，两天工作学习；（3）评工计分一个样：干部参加劳动，都按定额和劳动工效和社员一起评工分，记上劳动手册，一月一检查。（4）发工资一个样：非脱产干部和社员一样，定期按劳领工资，废除临时借支；（5）家属待遇一个样；干部家属一律按劳力强弱、技术高低参加农业生产，生活待遇也不能特殊。
    第三，在推行“五个一样”的同时，还必须教育每个干部，在劳动和生活上做到和群众同甘共苦，毫不特殊；而在思想和工作上，不能安于和群众一样，而要走在群众的前头，带领群众前进。
