    Introducing "Three Ascents to the Mountain"
    Jing Yu
    The Jiaozuo Liuzhuang Mining Area has adopted the method of "Three Ascents to the Mountain" to accelerate mine construction, improve ore grade, and promote overproduction of steel.
    "Three Ascents to the Mountain" refers to ore dressing ascending the mountain, crushing ascending the mountain, and roasting ascending the mountain. That is to say, the three processes of ore dressing, crushing, and roasting, which were originally carried out at the foot of the mountain, in steel plants, and next to blast furnaces, are now all moved to the mountain, where mining is done on the spot, processing is done on the spot, poor ore is transformed into rich ore, more fine materials are prepared for steel plants, and more steel is produced.
    “Three Ascents to the Mountain” and “Three Descents from the Mountain” differ by only one character. However, this one-character difference changes the situation greatly: First, the location of the processes has changed. The several ore dressing processes originally scattered in various steel plants at the foot of the mountain are now all concentrated on the mountain. This allows for the full utilization of crushing and sintering equipment capacity, the full utilization of ore resources, the on-site acquisition of materials, the large-scale production of artificial rich ore, and the manufacture of ideal fine materials. Second, the traffic and transportation conditions have changed. The ore mined from the mountains, as well as some gangue, had to be transported to various steel plants at the foot of the mountain for processing. Now, all processing is done on the mountain, and the gangue is not transported to the foot of the mountain. This can greatly reduce unnecessary transportation volume and repetitive labor of multiple loading and unloading, thereby shortening the ore production time. Third, all ore dressing, sintering, and other processes are now undertaken by the mining department, making the use of manpower and material resources more rational. This allows for overall planning, further tapping of labor potential, and reduction of ore production costs. Fourth, the appearance of the mine has changed, the grade of the ore has improved, and the quality and output of steel are more guaranteed. Since "Three Ascents to the Mountain" brings such huge changes to the appearance of the mine and steel production, why not do it?
    However, things should not be thought of too simply. "Three Ascents to the Mountain" is not just an organizational measure, where a decision is made and everyone moves to the mountain, solving all the problems and creating a new situation. More importantly, has the mindset of the personnel in the mining department changed? If the personnel in the mining department establish a firm quality viewpoint of consolidating and increasing the production of fine materials, they will, once an organizational decision is made, act vigorously, mobilizing all aspects of strength, and striving from mining and processing to operation, all around the central idea of producing more fine ore. If the personnel in the mining department lack the mindset of producing fine materials, or even regard the production of fine materials as an extra burden, thinking that "Three Ascents to the Mountain" is not as convenient as "Three Descents from the Mountain," then even if the organization makes a decision, it will not be possible to execute it vigorously because their minds are not aligned.
    After "Three Ascents to the Mountain," some mining departments will indeed have increased troubles, such as an expanded scope of management and increased production requirements. Technical equipment and other issues will also arise. However, although the mining department has increased a little trouble, the ironmaking plant saves a lot of trouble. Like in the past, the mining department only produced ore, and sent all the ore, good or bad, to the foot of the mountain. This practice was convenient and saved trouble for the mining department, but increased the difficulties and troubles for the ironmaking department. Which unit should bear this so-called "trouble" for the benefit of the whole cause? Obviously, it is much more beneficial for the mining department to undertake it. The mining department is the first link in the continuous production of the steel industry, a link that is related to the overall fate of steel production. Firmly establishing the idea of fine materials in this link, producing more good ore and more fine materials, creates conditions for the next production link. The more fine materials that enter the furnace, the more pig iron will be produced. As the output of iron increases, the output of steel can also increase. As the output of steel increases, the speed of our country's construction can also be accelerated.
    The practice of "Three Ascents to the Mountain" in the Liuzhuang Mining Area of Jiaozuo has already achieved remarkable results. We must consolidate this result and expand this result, spreading the experience of "Three Ascents to the Mountain" to mining departments with similar problems.

    介绍“三上山”
    静宇
    焦作刘庄采矿区采取“三上山”的办法，加速矿山建设，提高矿石品位，促进钢铁超产。
    “三上山”，就是选矿上山、破碎上山、焙烧上山。这就是说，选矿、破碎、焙烧三个工序，原来有的在山下、在钢铁厂里、在高炉旁边进行的；现在通统要搬到山上去，就地开采，就地加工，变贫矿为富矿，为钢铁厂准备更多的精料，生产更多的钢铁。
    三上山和三下山，只差一个字。然而，一字之差，情况大变：第一、工序的位置改变了，原来分散在山下各个钢铁的几道选矿工序，通统集中到山上去了。这就可以充分发挥破碎、烧结设备能力，充分利用矿石资源，就地取材，大搞人造富矿，制造理想的精料。第二、交通运输的状况改变了，原来在山上开采出来的矿石以及一些杂质矿石都要分送到山下各个钢铁厂加工处理，现在通统在山上处理了，杂质矿石不拉到山下去了。这就可以大大减少不必要的运量和多次装卸的重复劳动，从而缩短了矿石生产时间。第三、一切选矿、烧结等工序统由矿山部门担当起来了，人力物力的使用也就更加合理了。这就可以统筹安排，进一步挖掘劳动潜力，降低矿石生产成本。第四、矿山的面貌改变了，矿石的品位提高了，钢铁的质量和产量也就更加有保证了。“三上山”以后，既然给矿山面貌、钢铁生产带来如此巨大的变化。又何乐而不为？
    然而，事情也不要想的太简单。“三上山”不仅仅是一项组织措施，组织上一决定，大家都搬到山上去，什么问题就解决了，新的形势、新的局面就出现了。更重要的在于矿山部门人员思想上是不是改变了。矿山部门人员思想上树立起巩固的增产精料的质量观点，一旦组织决定，他们就会雷厉风行，动员各方面的力量，从采矿、加工到运转各个环节都围绕着多产精矿这一中心思想而努力。如果矿山部门人员缺乏生产精料的思想，甚至把生产精料作为自己的额外负担，认为“三上山”总不如“三下山”来得方便。那么，即使组织上做了决定，由于他们的思想不通，执行起来也就不可能那么雷厉风行。
    “三上山”以后，对某些矿山部门来说确实要增加一些麻烦，比如说，管理的范围扩大了，生产的要求提高了。技术设备等问题都跟上来了，然而，矿山部门虽然增加了一点麻烦，炼铁厂却省去了好多麻烦。像过去那样，矿山部门只出矿石，出了矿石不管好歹一齐送到山下去。这种做法，矿山部门是方便了，省事了，而炼铁部门的困难和麻烦却是增多了。究竟哪个单位承担起这个所谓“麻烦”的工作对整个事业有利呢？显然由矿山部门承担起来要有利得多。矿山部门是钢铁工业连续性生产中的第一个环节，是关系着钢铁生产全局命运的一个环节。在这个环节里巩固地树立起精料的思想，多产好矿、多产精料，这就给下一个生产环节创造条件。入炉的精料多，生铁也就产得多，铁的产量提高了，钢的产量也就可以增多，钢产增多了，我国的建设速度也就可以加快了。
    刘庄采矿区“三上山”的做法，已经取得了显著的成果，我们要巩固这个成果，扩大这个成果。把“三上山”经验传播到存在类似问题的矿山部门去。
