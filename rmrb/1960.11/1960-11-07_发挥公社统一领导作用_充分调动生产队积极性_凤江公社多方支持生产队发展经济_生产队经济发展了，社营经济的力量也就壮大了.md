    Give Play to the Unified Leadership Role of the Commune and Fully Mobilize the Enthusiasm of the Production Team
    Fengjiang Commune Supports Production Team Economic Development in Many Ways
    With the Economic Development of the Production Team, the Strength of the Commune-Run Economy Also Grows

    (Reported by this newspaper) The commune-run economy of Fengjiang Commune in Raoping County, Guangdong Province, has effectively promoted the development of production team economies by adopting the methods of joint commune-team operations and helping production brigades (Editor's note: i.e., production teams, which are the basic accounting units of the People's Commune, same below) solve problems related to seedlings, funds, and equipment.
    Fengjiang Commune is located at the foot of mountains and faces the sea, with more than 40,000 meters of coastline, vast beaches and shallow seas, as well as large tracts of barren mountains, with great production potential. After communization, the Party Committee of Fengjiang Commune, after careful study, decided to adopt the method of communes and teams working together, and using the commune's economic strength to help brigades develop production, in order to develop various resources and fully tap production potential.
    In the process of developing diversified operations and sideline production, Fengjiang Commune organizes and manages production brigades to operate those suitable for production brigade management and actively provides assistance; for those that are larger in scale and beyond the capacity of a single brigade, it is managed by the commune or jointly by the commune and the team, depending on the specific situation. Joint commune-team operations can not only give full play to the superiority of unified leadership by the commune, but also help mobilize the enthusiasm of the brigades and better solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and funds. For example, in reclaiming the Dieshidai beach, which is more than 11,000 mu wide, due to the large project and high investment, the commune adopted the method of joint commune-team reclamation. On the one hand, it organized 13 brigades, including Xiazhong, Bizhou, Dawo, and Xinlian, near Dieshidai, to carry out reclamation; on the other hand, the commune invested more than 230,000 yuan to help the brigades solve financial difficulties. This greatly increased the enthusiasm of the brigades to develop the beach. In just four months, they built the east and south dikes, which are 7,800 meters long and consist of a total of more than 1.1 million cubic meters of earthwork and more than 800,000 cubic meters of stonework, enclosing the beach. After the beach was enclosed, the commune distributed more than 6,000 mu of paddy fields within the dikes to the 13 brigades for planting according to proportion, and built a aquaculture farm with an area of more than 4,000 mu in the low-lying areas and ditches that are often flooded, which is directly operated by the commune. This enabled the commune and the brigade economies to develop.
    In addition to adopting the form of joint commune-team operation to develop the beach, Fengjiang Commune has also established "three birds" (chicken, duck, and goose) breeding farms, fish fry farms, and agricultural improved seed farms to help brigades solve difficulties in seedlings, funds, etc., and develop animal husbandry, orchards, and aquaculture. The establishment of these seedling farms has played a great role in the development of various production sectors of the brigades. For example, in raising "three birds," only three of the 20 brigades in the commune were able to breed their own seedlings in the past, and the rest had to buy seedlings from other places. Now a large "three birds" farm has been established, mainly raising female birds. Since this year, the farm has hatched more than 550,000 "three birds." Most of these "three birds" seedlings are loaned to the brigades for breeding, which has made this year's "three birds" in the commune develop rapidly. The "three birds" raised in the first eight and a half months of this year increased by more than doubled compared with the whole of last year, overfulfilling the annual transfer task. At the same time, the commune-run economy has also greatly increased its income in developing "three birds" seedlings. In addition to developing seedlings, Fengjiang Commune also uses the commune's accumulation to allocate cash to help poor teams with relatively simple economic income to develop production. In the past year or so, the commune has allocated a total of 180,000 yuan in loans and temporary funds to the brigades.
    In helping the development of the brigade economy, the commune-run enterprises in Fengjiang Commune have also added equipment to the brigade economy, carried out tool reforms, and improved labor efficiency. Since the beginning of this year, the commune's factories have built two hydroelectric stations for the brigade factories, 34 ox-drawn grinding, grain milling machines, supplied 45 pieces of agricultural and sideline product processing machinery, helped the brigades build and expand 45 factory buildings, and carried out various tool reforms, enabling the industry at the brigade level to develop greatly. The commune industry has also been continuously strengthened in supporting the brigade industry. In the past eight and a half months of this year, the total industrial output value of the commune reached 700,000 yuan, an increase of 2.6 times compared with the same period last year.

    发挥公社统一领导作用　充分调动生产队积极性
    凤江公社多方支持生产队发展经济
    生产队经济发展了，社营经济的力量也就壮大了
    本报讯　广东饶平县凤江公社的社办经济，采取社队联营和帮助大队（编者注：即生产队，是人民公社的基本核算单位，下同）解决种苗、资金、设备等办法，有效地促进了大队经济的发展。
    凤江公社背山面海，有四万多米长的海岸线，有广阔的海滩和浅海，也有大片的荒山，生产潜力很大。公社化以后，凤江公社党委会经过认真研究，决定采取社队一齐动手，并以公社经济力量帮助大队发展生产的办法，来开发各种资源，充分挖掘生产潜力。
    凤江公社在发展多种经营和副业生产的过程中，凡是适合生产大队经营的，就组织生产大队经营，并积极给以扶助；对于规模较大，一个大队无力经营的，根据具体情况，有的由公社经营，有的由社、队联营。社、队联营，既能充分发挥公社统一领导的优越性，又有利于调动大队的积极性，可以更好地解决劳力、资金不足的困难。例如，在围垦宽达一万一千多亩的叠石埭海滩的时候，由于工程大、投资多，公社就采取社、队联合围垦。一方面组织叠石埭附近的霞中、碧洲、大沃、新联等十三个大队进行围垦；另一方面，公社投资二十三万多元，帮助各大队解决资金困难。这样，就大大地提高了各个大队开发海滩的积极性，仅仅在四个月的时间内，便筑起了东、南两条长达七千八百多米、总共一百一十多万土方和八十多万石方的大堤，把海滩围了起来。海滩围成以后，公社又把埭内的六千多亩水田，按照比例分给十三个大队种植，而把经常渍水的低洼地、沟渠等，建成一个面积达四千多亩的水产养殖场，由公社直接经营。这就使公社和大队经济都能得到发展。
    凤江公社除了采取社、队联合经营的形式开发海滩以外，还建立了“三鸟”（鸡鸭鹅）种苗场、鱼苗场、农业良种场，帮助大队解决种苗、资金等困难，发展畜牧、果林、养殖等事业。这些种苗场的建立，对于大队各业生产的发展起了很大的作用。例如养“三鸟”，过去全社二十个大队只有三个队能够自己繁殖种苗，其余都要到外地购买种苗。现在建立了一个庞大的“三鸟”场，以饲养母禽为主，从今年以来，全场已孵出“三鸟”五十五万多只。这些“三鸟”种苗大部分都以贷款的方式，交给各个大队饲养，这就使今年全社“三鸟”获得飞跃发展。今年前八个半月饲养的“三鸟”，比去年全年增加了一倍多，超额完成了全年的上调任务。与此同时，社办经济在发展“三鸟”种苗中，也大大增加了收入。除了发展种苗外，凤江公社还利用公社的积累，拨出现金帮助经济收入比较单纯的穷队发展生产。一年多来，全社拨给各个大队的贷款和临时资金共达十八万元。
    在帮助大队经济的发展中，凤江公社的社办企业，也为大队经济增添设备，开展工具改革，提高劳动效率。今年以来，公社的工厂已为大队工厂建立水力站两个，牛拉磨谷、碾米机三十四部，供应农副产品加工机械四十五件，帮助大队兴建和扩建了四十五间厂房，并且进行了各种工具改革，使大队一级的工业有了很大的发展。而公社工业也在支援大队工业中不断地壮大，今年八个半月来，全社工业产值便达七十万元，比去年同期增长二倍六。
