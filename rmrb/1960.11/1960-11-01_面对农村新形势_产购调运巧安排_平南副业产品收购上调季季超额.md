Nanning, This Newspaper, 31st -- Pingnan County, Guangxi, in light of the current new situation in agricultural production, has made new arrangements for the production, procurement, transfer, and transport of rural sideline products. This has enabled them to complete and exceed their sideline product procurement and transfer-for-export plans ahead of schedule for each quarter from the first to the third. From January to mid-October, 91.49% of the annual monetary procurement plan has already been completed. The annual procurement plans for eighteen major products such as beef cattle, fresh eggs, flue-cured tobacco, and handmade paper have all been completed ahead of schedule.

After thoroughly implementing the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation and grain as the key link," Pingnan County has brought about many new changes in sideline production and commercial procurement. These are mainly reflected in: (1) After the main labor force is concentrated on agricultural production, especially grain production, it is necessary to make overall arrangements and use labor rationally, appropriately develop sideline production, and expand procurement sources under the premise of ensuring the labor force required for vigorously developing agriculture, especially grain production. (2) It is necessary to correctly resolve the contradiction between economic crops and grain crops competing for land. (3) Due to the busy farm work, the brigades, production teams, and commune members all require the commercial departments to make the procurement work more thorough, simplify the purchase and sales procedures, and better coordinate business hours with agricultural production. (4) After the main rural labor force is concentrated on agricultural production, especially grain production, it is necessary to better utilize the existing short-distance transportation capacity and improve transportation efficiency to meet the requirements of rapid procurement and rapid transfer and transport.

	Rational Use of Labor and Land
		To Produce Sideline Products

Based on these new situations and needs, Pingnan County vigorously reformed tools, innovated technologies, and improved efficiency in sideline production, so as to achieve increased production with less labor. Various communes also mobilized the masses to engage in sideline production by seizing every opportunity according to the busy and slack seasons of farming. For example, during the busy farming season, the Dapeng Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative mobilized commune members to collect various wild fibers while they were going up the mountains to plant miscellaneous grains. "Go up the mountain with a knife, come down the mountain with a load," and collected more than 220,000 catties in ten days, accounting for 71% of the annual procurement plan for this commodity.

On the land issue, they adopted methods such as land reclamation, intercropping and interplanting, and utilizing "five-edge" land to properly resolve the contradiction between economic crops and grain crops competing for land. At the same time, the commercial departments assisted the communes and brigades in promoting the experience of intercropping economic crops in grain and oil crop fields, such as planting medicinal materials in taro fields, flue-cured tobacco in sweet potato fields, winter tobacco in sugarcane fields, and jute in peanut fields. The county's area of intercropping and interplanting on commodity production bases reached more than 230,000 mu, equivalent to an increase of 93,000 mu of planting area.

	Seizing Opportunities, Combining Surprise Attacks with Regular Procurement

The county's commercial departments, based on the agricultural production season, the uneven production progress between regions, and the characteristics of different products, seized every opportunity and adopted a method combining large-scale surprise attacks, small-scale surprise attacks, and regular procurement to carry out procurement. They organized large-scale surprise attacks during slack farming seasons, small-scale surprise attacks of varying lengths during busy farming seasons, and switched to regular procurement during extremely busy farming seasons. They carried out surprise procurement of seasonal products such as jute, flue-cured tobacco, fruits, and wild plants, and carried out regular procurement of products such as poultry and fresh eggs. Since the third quarter, the county has seized the gap after the summer harvest and summer planting to organize a county-wide campaign to hand in and transport commodities, and purchased 1.04 million yuan worth of sideline products in three days. Various regions have also carried out local small-scale surprise procurements based on production conditions, and the procurement volume has increased month by month. The county's task of procuring sideline products in the third quarter was overfulfilled ahead of schedule by nineteen days.

Starting from the convenience of the commune members, the commercial departments transferred 380 employees to be stationed in the teams for a long time to cultivate sources of goods and carry out procurement. They also entrusted the brigade supply and marketing personnel and canteens to purchase on their behalf. During the surprise procurement in the third quarter, the commercial departments also transferred more than 80% of their personnel to the teams, added 90 temporary procurement points, and organized temporary procurement teams to implement fixed-point, timed appointment procurement.

	Vigorously Engaging in Piggyback Transportation to Improve Transportation Efficiency

In the process of procuring sideline products, the county vigorously carried out piggyback transportation, transportation route reform, and transportation tool reform to improve transportation efficiency and transfer sideline products out in a timely manner. Since the third quarter, the county has changed roundabout transportation to direct transportation for 41,000 tons of materials, saving 90,000 labor days. Various communes have used the opportunities of commune members attending meetings, going to market fairs, and transporting fertilizer to towns to carry out piggyback transportation and have carried out transportation technology reforms such as horse-drawn train transformation and canalization.

    面对农村新形势  产购调运巧安排
    平南副业产品收购上调季季超额
    本报南宁31日电　广西平南县根据当前农业生产的新形势，对农村副业产品的生产、收购、调运等方面作了新的安排，使一至三季度季季提前超额完成了副业产品收购和上调出口计划。从1月到10月中旬，年度金额收购计划已完成91.49％，菜牛、鲜蛋、烤烟、土纸等十八种主要产品的全年收购计划都已提前完成。
    平南县在深入贯彻“以农业为基础，以粮食为纲”的方针以后，给副业生产和商业收购工作带来了许多新的变化。主要表现在：（一）主要劳动力集中于农业生产、特别是粮食生产以后，必须统筹安排，合理地使用劳力，在保证大办农业、特别是大办粮食所需劳力的前提下，适当开展副业生产，扩大收购货源。（二）需要正确地解决经济作物与粮食作物争地的矛盾。（三）由于农活较忙，大队、生产队和社员都要求商业部门的收购工作更加深入，购销手续要简化，营业时间要更好地和农业生产相配合。（四）农村主要劳动力集中搞农业生产、特别是粮食生产以后，需要更好地运用现有的短途运输力量，提高运输效率，以适应快收购、快调运的要求。
      合理使用劳力土地
        生产副业产品
    根据这些新的形势和需要，平南县在副业生产方面大力改革工具，革新技术，提高效率，实现少用人仍能增产。各公社还根据农事季节的忙闲，发动群众见缝插针搞副业生产。如大朋公社供销部在农忙季节，乘社员上山种杂粮的机会，发动社员附带采集各种野生纤维，
  “上山带把刀，下山挑一挑”，十天之内就采集了二十二万多斤，占这项商品年度收购计划的71％。
    在土地问题上，他们采取了开荒、间种套种、利用“五边”地等办法，妥善地解决了经济作物与粮食作物争土地的矛盾。与此同时，商业部门协助公社、大队推广在粮食、油料作物地里间种经济作物的经验，如在芋头田里种药材，红薯地里种烤烟，甘蔗地里种冬烟，花生地里种黄麻等，全县在商品生产基地间种、套种的土地达二十三万多亩，相当于增加了九万三千亩的种植面积。
            找缝插针，突击和经常收购相结合
    全县商业部门根据农业生产季节、地区之间生产进度不平衡以及不同产品的特点，找缝插针，运用大突击、小突击与经常收购相结合的办法，开展收购。农闲时组织大突击，农活较忙时组织时间长短不同的小突击，农活大忙时转入经常收购；对黄麻、烤烟、水果、野生植物等季节性较强的产品进行突击收购，对家禽、鲜蛋等产品则进行经常收购。从第三季度以来，全县抓紧在夏收夏种后空隙时机，组织了一次全县规模的交售和运送商品的大突击运动，三天内收购了一百零四万元的副业产品。各地区也根据生产情况，开展了局部的小规模突击收购，收购量月月上升。全县第三季度的副业产品收购任务提前十九天超额完成。
    商业部门从方便社员出发，抽调了三百八十名职工长期驻队，培植货源，开展收购，还委托大队供销员和食堂代购。在第三季度突击收购期间，商业部门又抽调了80％以上的人员下队，增设临时收购点九十个，还组织了临时收购组，实行定点、定时预约收购。
              大搞捎脚运输，提高运输效率
    在副业产品收购过程中，全县大搞捎脚运输、运输线路改革和运输工具改革，提高运输效率，将副业产品及时调运出去。从三季度以来，全县改迂回运输为直线运输调运的物资有四万一千吨，节约了九万个劳动日。各公社都利用社员开会、赶圩和上集镇运肥的机会，捎带运输，并进行了马拉列车化、渠道化等运输技术改革。
