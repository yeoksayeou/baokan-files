Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 31st: The seven iron and steel plants in Hefei, Anhui Province, completed this year's pig iron production plan seventy-seven days ahead of schedule on October 15th.

The iron produced by the seven plants in the first nine and a half months of this year increased significantly compared to the same period last year. Compared with the first to third quarters of last year, various economic and technical indicators improved, with the blast furnace utilization coefficient increasing from 0.98 to 2.44, and the coke ratio decreasing from 1.51 to 0.95. The qualified rate of pig iron has also increased. This year, the seven plants have also saved a large number of laborers to support other newly built and expanded enterprises and agricultural production.

Since the beginning of this year, the workers and staff of the seven iron and steel plants in Hefei City have consistently adhered to the technical transformation of small blast furnaces. At present, the small blast furnaces put into production in the seven iron and steel plants have been basically comprehensively transformed. Blast Furnace No. 38 of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's Iron and Steel Plant, the Youth Pioneer Furnace of the Zhengfa No. 1 Iron Plant, and the Rocket Furnace of the Finance and Trade Iron and Steel Plant, etc., have all completed the annual pig iron production plan half a year ahead of schedule due to thorough transformation; the utilization coefficient has been greatly improved, the average qualified rate of pig iron is above 95%, and the coke ratio is below 0.9.

The plants have also carried out a series of reforms in raw material processing, transportation, and supply. Generally, they have achieved mechanization of ore crushing, vehicle and rail transportation, machine operation for opening and closing tap holes, weighing of materials with weighbridges, and iron molds for tapping, eliminating heavy physical labor such as shoulder carrying and manual lifting within the factory.

While grasping the technical transformation of small blast furnaces, the seven iron and steel plants in Hefei City also vigorously grasped raw material supply. In addition to improving operating techniques to reduce the consumption of raw coal and ore and lower the coke ratio, the workers and staff of each plant also carried forward the spirit of hard work and practical work, trying every means to conserve and increase the production of raw materials. As of October 15th, the iron and steel plants had used ore powder, limestone powder, and coke powder to produce more than 100,000 tons of sintered ore. At present, the daily output of sintered ore has reached about 900 tons, and the amount of sintered ore charged into the furnace generally accounts for 20% to 50% of the amount of ore. Each coking plant also uses coke powder and anthracite to mix and coke, and uses coal slime to make coke. As of October 15th, the seven plants had saved a total of more than 95,000 tons of raw coal and increased the production of coke by more than 50,000 tons. In addition, the iron and steel plants also mobilized the masses to adopt methods such as picking, sweeping, digging, and screening to save a large number of raw materials and fuels.

The Anhui Provincial Party Committee, the Hefei Municipal Party Committee, and the Party Committees of the seven iron and steel plants have all effectively strengthened their leadership over iron and steel production, adhered to putting politics in command, and comprehensively grasped ideology, production, and life. Leading cadres at all levels of the seven plants often spend one-third to one-half of their time participating in production and leading production, and extensively cultivate "experimental fields." After the development of the increased production and conservation movement, a large number of cadres were also delegated to workshops, blast furnaces, work sections, and teams to enrich the leadership strength at the front line.

### 大抓高炉技术改造　大搞原料增产节约  合肥七铁厂提前完成年计划

    大抓高炉技术改造　大搞原料增产节约
    合肥七铁厂提前完成年计划
    据新华社合肥31日电　安徽省合肥市七个钢铁厂提前七十七天在10月15日完成了今年生铁生产计划。
    七个厂今年九个半月生产的铁比去年同期增长很多；各项经济技术指标与去年一至三季度相比，高炉利用系数由零点九八提高到二点四四，入炉焦比由一点五一降低到零点九五。生铁合格率也有提高。七个厂今年还节约出大批劳动力，支援了其他新建扩建企业和农业生产。
    合肥市七个钢铁厂的职工，从今年一开始到现在，一直坚持了对小高炉的技术改造工作。目前七个钢铁厂投入生产的小高炉都已基本上进行了全面改造。中共安徽省委机关钢铁厂的三十八号炉、政法一铁厂的青年先锋号炉、财贸钢铁厂的火箭号炉等，由于改造彻底，都提前半年完成了全年生铁生产计划；利用系数大大提高，生铁合格率平均在95％以上，焦比在零点九以下。
    各厂在原料加工、运输供应方面，也进行了一系列的改革。一般都实现了矿石破碎机械化，运输车子化、轨道化，开、堵铁口用机器，称料有地磅，出铁用铁模，消灭了厂内的肩挑人抬等笨重的体力劳动。
    合肥市七个钢铁厂在抓紧小高炉技术改造的同时，还大抓原料供应工作。各厂职工除改进操作技术，减少原煤、矿石的消耗，降低入炉焦比以外，还发扬苦干实干精神，千方百计节约和增产原料。到10月15日止，各钢铁厂利用矿粉、石灰石粉、焦炭粉生产了十万多吨烧结矿。目前烧结矿的日产量已达九百吨左右，烧结矿的入炉数量一般占矿石数量的20％—50％。各个焦厂也利用焦粉、无烟煤搭配炼焦，用煤泥炼焦。到10月15日止，七个厂共节约原煤九万五千多吨，增产焦炭五万多吨。此外各钢铁厂还发动群众采取拣、扫、挖、筛等办法，节约了大批原料和燃料。
    中共安徽省委、合肥市委和七个钢铁厂的党委，都切实加强了对钢铁生产的领导，坚持政治挂帅，全面抓思想、生产和生活。七个厂的各级领导干部经常以三分之一到二分之一的时间，参加生产、领导生产，广种“试验田”。开展增产节约运动以后，又下放了大批干部到车间、高炉、工段、班组充实第一线的领导力量。
