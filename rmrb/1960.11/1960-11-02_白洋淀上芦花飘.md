    Reed Catkins Float on Baiyang Lake
    Li Hui
    Friend: You asked me to write to you about Baiyang Lake. Last spring when you came here, the lake was all green, a riot of colors, but now it's autumn, and the lake is all golden, shining brightly.
    Baiyang Lake in autumn can be said to be a world of reeds. The reeds stretch as far as the eye can see, and the snow-white reed catkins, like clouds, float atop the tall, straight, golden reeds. In the distance, in some areas where the water is wide and the grass sparse, flocks of partridges and wild ducks circle and play. The water chestnut leaves have turned red; the lotus flowers have formed lotus pods, like small brown plates holding shiny black pearl-like seeds, standing among the patches of dark red lotus leaves. The green grass has grown long ears, and suddenly several carp bite off some blades of grass, stirring up the waves to eat the grass seeds. Southward-bound swallows cut through the waves on the water with the gentle breeze; several fishing boats speed past with their white sails raised, startling the birds in the grass and chasing away the fish that were eating grass seeds... The beautiful autumn scenery on the lake is as intoxicating as the fine wine of a prosperous life!
    You asked in your letter whether the reeds have been harvested. I was just about to tell you about that. Reeds are cold dew grass, and now is the time to harvest them. Look, before the morning sun has even peeked out, teams of reed-cutting boats are already on the lake. People roll up their sleeves and swing their sickles, and no matter how cold the weather, they work up a sweat, reaping the beloved reeds with every swing of the sickle. When the boats are full, small steamships come and go, towing the cut reeds and unloading them onto the dry shore. Reeds have many names, such as white skin, yellow brew, white hair... each with its own use.
    I want to tell you about how we lost a battle in reed cutting this year. That night, there was a village meeting, and our shock brigade made a pledge at the meeting, guaranteeing to complete the reed-cutting task in five days with quality and quantity. In the past, if other teams heard that our "Nine Tiger Team" had made a pledge, they wouldn't even think about surpassing us. But guess what? This year, the "Huang Zhong Team" took the lead. Speaking of the "Huang Zhong Team," you probably don't know who they are. Do you remember that old man you saw in the lake last year, who was spearing fish, one fish with every thrust, never missing? He even told us stories later. We call him Uncle Heqi, he is in his fifties, with a round face, and he is the captain of the "Huang Zhong Team," and now he is also a Communist Party member!
    The reason we lost this time is that we only knew how to work hard and forgot how to work smart, and we were also complacent and didn't take the other teams seriously. This year, the reeds are growing particularly well, tall and dense. On the first day, we tied with the "Huang Zhong Team." We were not convinced, saying that they were like hunchbacks climbing mountains – strong at the start but weak at the end. But the next day, the "Huang Zhong Team" cut more than five mu more than us, which made us all so anxious that our eyes were burning. We immediately held a meeting to discuss... That night, Uncle Heqi found us and shared his experience. The main reason they cut more was that they paid attention to working smart. He said, "A boat against the wind, a sickle with the wind. When cutting reeds, the boat should face the wind and lean against the reed bank, and the sickle should swing with the wind, so that the boat is stable and the sickle is fast." The next day, Uncle Heqi personally gave us guidance, and later we managed to catch up. The big red flag on our boat was immediately planted on the "Huang Zhong Team's" boat. The girls who brought the meals even sang congratulatory songs for them, which was really lively. In the golden, reed catkin-filled, and autumn water-connected scenery, how beautiful the girls' singing was!
    Now the reeds are almost finished being cut. The men and women of the team are either combing reeds, bundling reeds, stacking reeds, or making mats, weaving mats... Whenever the eastern sun breaks the paint pot, reddening the sky and reddening the water, a cloud of white immediately rises from the threshing ground where the reeds are being gathered, which is the reed catkins being shaken up and floating in the wind, followed by a burst of singing and laughter, which is the girls competing.
    The stacked reeds are like small golden mountains. Do you know how long the two large dikes on the east and west sides of our village are? Now they are already piled full of reeds, looking like our village's two golden wings from a distance, and our village has become like a flying golden phoenix.
    Dear friend: The autumn filled with reeds is a golden world. When the sun rolls out of the blue sky, the entire lake surface is filled with floating reed catkins, and the singing is rippling. In the golden reed banks, how many boats, how many sickles, how many hands, and how many smiling faces are welcoming the morning mist and wearing the evening glow as they harvest the reeds! Friend: When you see the commune members' soaring energy, you will definitely not be able to stop the excitement in your heart.
    Do you have time to come? Take a look at the autumn on this lake, the great leap forward scene after the commune, it is truly a scene of ten thousand rays of sunshine and a thriving scene!

### 白洋淀上芦花飘

    白洋淀上芦花飘
    李辉
    朋友：你让我给你写信，说说白洋淀上的事。去年春天你来这里的时候，那时满淀一片翠绿，万紫千红，现在正是秋天，满淀一片金黄，金光闪闪。
    白洋淀的秋天可说是苇子的世界，满淀的芦苇远接天边，雪白的芦花像云朵，在金黄笔直的芦苇顶上飘来飘去。远处几片水阔草稀的地方，成群的鸪?、野鸭在盘旋戏水。菱角叶子变成了红色；荷花已结成了莲蓬，像一个个褐色的小盘托着黑亮亮的珍珠子站在一片片黑红色的大荷叶丛中；青草结了长大的穗子，忽而几条?鱼咬折了几棵青草，翻着浪花吞食草籽。南归的燕子乘着微风剪去了水上的浪花；几只渔船扬着白帆飞快驶过，惊飞了草中鸟，惊跑了正在吃草籽的鱼……淀上秋天的美景，像是丰足的生活的美酒一样醉人呵！
    你来信说，芦苇收割了吗？我也正想和你说说这事。苇子是寒露草，现在正是收割芦苇的时候。你看吧，当早晨的太阳还没露脸，成队的割苇子的船早下了淀，人们卷起袖子挥起大镰，不论多冷的天气，人们干得总是满头大汗，一镰一镰收割着惹人喜爱的芦苇。船满了，小汽船来回拖载着割下的苇子，卸到旱岸上。苇子的名字很多，有白皮、黄酿、白毛子……，各有各的用处。
    我要说的是我们今年割苇子吃败仗的事。那天晚上，村里开大会，我们这个突击队在会上立了挑战书，保证五天按质按量完成割苇子的任务。要是往日，别的队一听说我们这个“九虎队”立了挑战书，就不用想能赶过我们了。这一回你猜怎么着？今年叫人家“黄忠队”给走在头里了。说到“黄忠队”，你大概不知道是谁们。你还记得吗，去年你来的时候，在淀里看见的那个叉鱼的老头，一叉一条鱼，叉叉不落空，后来他还给咱讲故事来哪。我们管他叫贺其叔，五十来岁年纪，圆脸盘，他就是“黄忠队”的队长，现在还是共产党员了哪！
    这回我们打败仗的原因是：我们光知道猛干，忘了巧干，又加上我们自满，把别的队没看在眼里。今年苇子长得特别好，又高又密。头一天我们和“黄忠队”干了个平手。我们不服气，说他们是罗锅子上山——有前劲没后劲。可是第二天一下子“黄忠队”比我们多割了五亩多，这一下把我们全急得眼里冒了火，立即开会讨论……那天晚上还是贺其叔找了我们去交流了一下经验，人家割得多的主要原因是：注意了巧干。他说：“迎风船，顺风镰，割苇子船要迎风靠苇滩，下镰时要顺风下，这样船又稳镰又快。”第二天，贺其叔还亲自给我们作了指导，后来才算赶了上去。我们船上那杆大红旗立即就插到“黄忠队”的船上了。送饭来的姑娘们还给他们唱了贺喜的歌，可真热闹极了。在金光闪耀、芦花飘飘，秋水连天的美景中，姑娘们的歌声是多么动听呵！
    现在苇子割得差不多快完了，队里的男男女女，有的梳苇子、捆苇子、垛苇子，有的打箔、织席……每当东方太阳碰破了颜料缸、染红了天，染红了水的时候，拾打苇子的场上立时腾起一片白云，那就是被抖起的芦花在随风飘动，接着是一阵歌声、笑声传来，那是姑娘们在竞赛。
    垛起的芦苇像金色的小山。你知道吧？我们村子东西的两条大堤有多长呵！现在早就堆满了苇子，远远看去真像我们村的两只金色翅膀，我们村变得像只飞着的金凤凰了。
    亲爱的朋友：铺满苇子的秋天是金色的世界，当太阳滚出蓝天，整个淀面芦花飘起，歌声荡漾，在金光闪闪的苇滩里有多少只船，多少张镰，多少双手，多少张笑脸迎着朝雾、披着晚霞在收割芦苇！朋友：当你看到社员们那种冲天干劲，你一定会止不住心中的激动。
    有时间来吗？看看这淀上之秋，公社化后的跃进盛景，真是霞光万道，一片欣欣向荣的景象呵！
