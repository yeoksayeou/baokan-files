    Developing Independent and Autonomous Foreign Trade and National Economy
    Cuba Establishes "Rebel Shipping Company"
    Withdraws from U.S.-Controlled International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 16th: In order to independently and autonomously develop trade relations with countries around the world, Cuba has established a state-owned "Rebel Shipping Company," which possesses a merchant fleet that is gradually growing in strength.
    Due to the nationalization of the shipping industry, the "Rebel Shipping Company" currently owns nineteen ships with a cargo capacity of 71,000 tons, employing 2,500 nautical and land-based personnel. The 4,000-ton "Pinar del Río" cargo ship has sailed as far as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, where it unloaded Cuban sugar.
    As foreign trade gradually breaks free from the shackles of American monopoly groups, Cuba is planning to purchase nine 10,000-ton ships in order to further develop independent and autonomous foreign trade and the national economy.
    Although Cuba is an island nation, it previously did not have its own merchant fleet. In the past, the United States monopolized Cuba's trade and controlled its shipping industry, causing Cuba to suffer double exploitation.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Washington news: The U.S.-controlled International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank for short) announced in Washington on the 15th that Cuba has formally withdrawn from the bank and is no longer a member. The bank said in a statement that Cuba's withdrawal took effect on the 14th after receiving written notification from Cuba regarding the decision.
    Cuba's decision was made in accordance with an order issued by the Cuban President in mid-October. The order stated that "the Republic of Cuba now has no reason to remain in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, because the economic policies implemented by this institution are far from effectively promoting the development and expansion of the Cuban economy."

    发展独立自主的对外贸易和民族经济
    古巴成立“起义者航运公司”
    退出美国控制的国际复兴开发银行
    新华社哈瓦那16日电　为了独立自主地发展同世界各国的贸易关系，古巴已经建立一家国营“起义者航运公司”，这家公司拥有一支正在逐渐壮大的商船队。
    由于实现海运业国有化，“起义者航运公司”目前已经拥有十九艘船只，它们的货运能力为七万一千吨，航海和陆上工作人员达二千五百人。四千吨的“比那尔德里奥”号货船曾远航朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并且在那里卸下了古巴糖。
    随着对外贸易逐步摆脱美国垄断集团的束缚，古巴正在计划购买九艘万吨轮船，以便进一步发展独立自主的对外贸易和民族经济。
    虽然古巴是一个岛国，但是它过去没有自己的商船队。过去，美国垄断着古巴的贸易，并且控制着它的海运业，古巴因此而遭受双重的剥削。
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：美国控制的国际复兴开发银行（简称世界银行）15日在华盛顿宣布，古巴已正式退出这家银行，不再成为它的成员国。这家银行发表的声明说，古巴的退出是在14日接到古巴关于这个问题的决定的书面通知后生效的。
    古巴的这一决定是根据古巴总统在10月中旬发布的一项命令作出的。命令指出，“现在古巴共和国没有理由留在国际复兴开发银行中，因为这个机构执行的经济政策远不能有效地促进古巴经济的发展和扩大。”
