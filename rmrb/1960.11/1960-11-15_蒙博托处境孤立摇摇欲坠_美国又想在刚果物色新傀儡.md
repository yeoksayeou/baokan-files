Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th: The U.S. government is stepping up its policy of swallowing the Congo whole. State Department officials are currently in the Congo continuing to support the Mobutu rebel group, which is fiercely opposed by the Congolese people, and are intensifying their conspiracy to prop up new "leading figures" to serve as tools for continued U.S. aggression against the Congo. The "Wall Street Journal" reported that "there is no doubt that the United States had high hopes for Mobutu, hoping that he could establish a stable Congolese government (from the U.S. perspective)." However, news from Leopoldville says that "Mobutu is in trouble," and he "is losing control of the Congolese government, and Lumumba may regain power." This has led U.S. diplomats to believe that the situation "may be approaching a dangerous new turning point, so they are looking for new Congolese leaders to support if the trend of Mobutu's downfall continues."

The most recent issue of the French weekly "International Forum" said that "Mobutu's friends are trying to find a replacement," but the U.S. "State Department has not yet found a suitable candidate to succeed the ineffective Mobutu." The weekly said that because time is pressing, the U.S. is therefore putting pressure on Mobutu to find ways to support the situation. "Representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Leopoldville have told Mobutu that they will deprive him of financial assistance if he does not make progress."

    蒙博托处境孤立摇摇欲坠
    美国又想在刚果物色新傀儡
    据新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在加紧推行鲸吞刚果的政策。国务院的官员目前正在刚果继续支持遭到刚果人民猛烈反对的蒙博托叛乱集团，并且在加紧阴谋扶植新的“领袖人物”，来充当美国继续侵略刚果的工具。“华尔街日报”报道说，“毫无疑问，美国对蒙博托曾寄予很大希望，希望他能成立一个（对美国说来）稳定的刚果政府”。可是，目前来自利奥波德维尔的消息说“蒙博托正处于困境”，他“正在失去对刚果政府的控制，卢蒙巴可能重新掌权”。这使得美国的外交家们认为局势“可能接近一个危险的新的转折点，因此他们正在寻找可以支持的新的刚果领袖，如果蒙博托垮台的趋势继续下去的话”。
    最近一期的法国“国际论坛”周刊说，“蒙博托的朋友正在设法换换人”，可是美国“国务院迄今还没有找到一个能够继承已失去作用的蒙博托的适当人选”。这家周刊说，由于时间很紧迫，美国因此正在对蒙博托施压力，要他想办法支撑局面。“美国驻利奥波德维尔大使馆的代表已经告诉蒙博托：他们将剥夺给他的财政援助，如果他没有进展的话。”
