    Xinhua News Agency, Conakry: Guinea's news agency "News Weekly" published a commentary on the results of the U.S. presidential election on the 15th, stating that for those who pay attention to the U.S. election propaganda, the two U.S. candidates do not have fundamental differences in policy. The commentary pointed out that the result of this election "is less a victory for the Democrats than a defeat for the Republicans." It illustrates the bankruptcy of the aggressive policies implemented by the Republican Eisenhower administration. It pointed out that the U.S. policy in the Far East is unpopular and has suffered a series of failures. It cited as examples the opposition to Eisenhower's visit to Asia not long ago, the South Korean people's rejection of the Syngman Rhee clique, the Japanese people's rising up against the Japan-U.S. military treaty, and the downfall of Nobusuke Kishi. The commentary said, "In the Americas, the victory of the Cuban Revolution has shaken the foundation of U.S. foreign policy, while strengthening the determination of the people of Latin American countries to fight for independence." In Africa, U.S. policy has also "failed to win the favor of African countries."
    The commentary pointed out that Kennedy was elected by taking advantage of the decline in the international prestige of the United States and launching an "election offensive." However, since he does not change the U.S. foreign policy, he "certainly cannot" change the position of the United States.

    几内亚“新闻周报”指出
    美国换总统不换政策
    新华社科纳克里电　几内亚新闻社“新闻周报”15日就美国总统选举结果发表评论说，对于注意美国竞选宣传的人来说，美国两个候选人在政策上并没有根本的分歧。评论指出，这次选举的结果“与其说是民主党人的胜利，不如说是共和党人的失败”。它说明了共和党的艾森豪威尔政府所执行的侵略政策的破产。它指出，美国在远东的政策不得人心，遭受一系列失败。它举例说，艾森豪威尔不久前访问亚洲时遭到反对，李承晚集团遭到南朝鲜人民的唾弃，日本人民奋起反对日美军事条约以及岸信介的垮台。评论说，“在美洲，古巴革命的胜利动摇了美国的外交政策的基础，同时增强了拉丁美洲各国人民争取独立的决心。”在非洲方面，美国的政策也“未能博得非洲国家的好感”。
    评论指出，肯尼迪是利用美国国际威信下降的情况展开“竞选攻势”而当选的。但是，由于他并不改变美国的对外政策，“肯定是不能”改变美国的地位的。
