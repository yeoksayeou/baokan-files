    Luoyang Tractor Factory's Standard Parts Workshop Implements the "Two-Four, Three-One" System to Lead Production More Deeply
    (Our dispatch) The Standard Parts Workshop of Luoyang Tractor Factory in Henan Province adheres to the "Two-Four, Three-One" system of going deep into the front lines, promoting cadre participation in labor and worker participation in management.
    In July of this year, when Comrade Yang Ligong, the First Secretary of the Tractor Factory's Party Committee, participated in manual labor in the steel casting workshop, he proposed the implementation of the "Two-Four, Three-One" system based on the leadership method of the "Two-Five" system in Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, and the situation of the factory. The Party Committee decided to implement it throughout the factory. "Two-Four" means: Every day, each cadre spends four hours participating in labor and work in the production team, and four hours attending meetings, studying, and handling daily business above. "Three-One" means: On the basis of clear division of labor, leading cadres are responsible for one area, go deep into one point, and grasp one key. In order to ensure the implementation of this system, the factory party committee stipulates that cadres at the factory, workshop, department, and production team levels should not hold meetings in the morning. At present, this system has been widely implemented throughout the factory.
    To go down, the Party branch's meetings must first be reduced. In order to streamline meetings, the general branch divided all work into four fronts: (1) production; (2) technical innovation; (3) production support; (4) living welfare, led by general branch members separately. The general branch manages the work of each front twice a month, and one to several times for minor management. That is, arrange at the beginning of the month and summarize and check at the end of the month; hold one to several general branch meetings every week according to the urgency to supervise and check. In this way, the general branch secretary is first liberated from trivial affairs, spends one-half to one-third of his time in the group, and can also spare a certain amount of time to consider major issues.
    However, the problem was not solved. The general branch secretary was liberated from the circle of affairs, and a large number of problems poured into the members in charge of each front. After the workshop director in charge of the production front went to the group, people followed him one after another, asking to solve the problems in daily production. In order to solve this contradiction, the Party branch of the workshop decided to twist each front into a whole. For example, the quality, technology, and tool departments with the most interrelationships in production are organized into a production leading group. This greatly overcomes the phenomenon of each section going its own way and twists them into one rope. As a result, solving problems is more proactive than before. They often use meal times to solve problems, and the meetings are short and good. In the past, leading cadres spent more than 70% of their time entangled in meetings, now it only takes about 20% of the time.
    With the implementation of the "Two-Four, Three-One" system, the production management groups were generally rectified to truly become a grassroots collective leadership force, becoming a leading core that manages both production and life, and politics and economy. They not only manage completely but also well. The establishment and improvement of the group core have reduced the daily affairs of the department and workshop-level cadres, enabling cadres to consider some major issues.
    In order to enable cadres to effectively go deep into the grassroots, the workshop party general branch, according to the cadre and group situation of the entire workshop, selected thirty-eight of the sixty-one cadres to go directly to the groups. The remaining cadres went deep into the groups by each section and department according to the situation, plus those who were long-term workers, those who were regularly sent down for one month, and those who participated in half-day labor now, a new situation emerged in which cadres were strengthened to the production front line in batches.
    How to take care of the overall work while going deep into one group. They found the answer in their actual work, called "one squat, two turns, three head-to-heads." Squat means to take their own squatting group as a base point, while laboring, observing, and thinking, to discover problems from it; to understand the activities of the whole group in participating in pre-shift and post-shift meetings; to help summarize experience in the group, to be a good advisor, and to improve the political awareness and management level of the group leader. Turn means that in four hours of labor, about one-third of the time can be used to understand the situation in other machine tools and groups. Head-to-head means to understand the situation of the area and exchange experience at the head-to-head meetings of the Party general branch, each front, and the department every week, and discuss solutions to problems.
    The purpose of squatting is to summarize experience, discover problems, and guide the overall situation. Comrade Tang Ruijie, Secretary of the Workshop Party General Branch, went deep into the third group of the cold heading spring department and helped the group leader learn the meeting leadership methods of explaining and preparing before the meeting, enlightening and guiding during the meeting, and affirming right and wrong after the meeting, so that the group's meetings are often short and effective. When he learned from the turnover and head-to-head meetings that some groups were holding "dumb meetings," unable to carry out criticism, and the time was too long, he organized the core group leaders and industrial management group leaders of the entire workshop to attend and listen to the group's meeting. This on-site meeting of an observation nature greatly improved the quality of each group meeting. The cadres of the workshop tool warehouse found that workers were lining up for a long time to receive tools during squatting labor, so they quickly changed it to "delivery to the door," which was very popular with the workers.
    This method of combining points and surfaces has been used freely by the leaders. They summarized it into four sentences: "Start with the point, focus on the area, take root on the point, and bear fruit on the area."
    Because the cadres went deep into the production front line, many key problems that had not been solved for a long time were solved, and production changed significantly. The Standard Parts Workshop completed the annual commodity output value plan ninety-four days ahead of schedule and was named a red banner unit for the first time this year.

    着手在点  着眼在面  点上生根  面上结果
    洛阳拖拉机厂标准零件车间实行“二四、三一”制度领导生产更加深入
    本报讯　河南洛阳拖拉机厂标准零件车间坚持深入第一线的“二四、三一”制度，促进了干部参加劳动，工人参加管理。
    今年7月，拖拉机厂党委第一书记杨立功同志在铸钢车间参加体力劳动的时候，根据河北省吴桥县“二五”制的领导方法和本厂的情况，提出了推行“二四、三一”制的建议，党委决定在全厂推行。“二四”即：每天每个干部四小时在生产小组参加劳动和工作，四小时在上边开会、学习、处理日常业务。“三一”即：领导干部在明确分工的基础上，一人挡一个面、深入一个点、抓一个关键。为保证这一制度的贯彻执行，厂党委规定厂部、各车间、工部、生产小组四级干部每日上午一律不开会。目前这一制度在全厂已广泛推行。
    要下去，党总支的会议首先必须减少。为了精简会议，总支把全部工作分为：（一）生产；（二）技术革新；（三）生产后方；（四）生活福利四条战线，由总支委员分头率领。总支每月对各战线工作大管两次，小管一次至数次。即月初布置，月末总结检查；每周按轻重缓急开一至数次总支会议督促检查。这样一来，总支书记首先从繁琐事务中解放出来，每天有二分之一到三分之一的时间在小组，还能抽出一定的时间考虑重大问题。
    但是，问题并没有得到解决。总支书记从事务圈里解放出来了，大堆问题都拥到了各战线主管的委员身上了，分管生产战线的车间主任下到了小组后，接二连三的人也跟着找到了小组，要求解决日常生产中的问题。为了解决这个矛盾，该车间党总支研究决定把每条战线扭成一个整体。如生产中相互关系最多的质量、工艺、工具等部门就组成为生产领导小组。这样就大大克服了各科室的各自为政现象，拧成了一股绳。这样做的结果，解决问题比以前主动了，他们往往利用吃饭的时间就把问题解决了，会议开得又短又好。过去领导干部每周有70％以上的时间是纠缠在会议中，现在只用20％左右的时间就行了。
    随着“二四、三一”制度的贯彻执行，各生产管理小组普遍进行了整顿，使其真正成为基层集体领导的力量，成为既管生产又管生活，既管政治又管经济的领导核心。他们不仅管得全，而且管得好。小组核心的建立和健全，又减轻了工部一级和车间一级干部的日常事务，使干部能够考虑一些重大问题。
    为了干部切实地深入到最基层的群众中，车间党总支根据全车间的干部和小组情况，在六十一名干部中，抽出了三十八名直接到小组里去。其余干部由各科室、工部自己按照情况深入各组，加上长期下放当工人的，定期下放一个月的和现在参加半日劳动的，就出现了成批成套干部加强生产第一线的新局面。
    深入在一个小组，如何照管全面工作。他们在实际工作中找到了答案，叫作“一蹲，二转，三碰头”。蹲，就是以自己蹲的小组为基点，边劳动，边观察，边思考，从中发现问题；在参加班前会、班后会中了解全组的活动；在小组中帮助总结经验，作好参谋，提高小组领导的政治觉悟和管理水平。转，就是在四小时劳动中，约可以抽出三分之一左右的时间在其它机床和小组了解情况。碰头，即在党总支、各战线、工部每周的碰头会上了解面的情况和交流经验，商量解决问题。
    蹲点的目的是总结经验，发现问题，指导全面。车间党总支书记唐瑞阶同志深入到冷镦弹簧工部第三组，帮助小组长学会了会前交底准备，会上启发诱导，会后肯定是非的开会领导方法，使这个小组的会议经常开得时间短，效果好。当他在转面和碰头会上了解到部分小组开“哑叭会”，展不开批评，时间过长的情况时，就组织了全车间的核心组长、工管组长列席旁听这个小组的会议。这个观摩性质的现场会，使各组会议质量大大提高。车间工具库的干部在蹲点劳动中，发现了工人排老长队领工具，于是迅速改变为“送货上门”，很受工人欢迎。
    这种点面结合的方法，各领导干部已经运用自如。他们把它总结为四句话：“着手在点，着眼在面，点上生根，面上结果”。
    由于干部深入生产第一线，许多长期未能解决的关键问题得到了解决，生产起了显著变化。标准零件车间提前了九十四天超额完成了全年商品产值计划，今年第一次被评为红旗单位。
