    Let Teaching Serve Agricultural Production Effectively
    Hunan Agricultural College Teachers and Students Go Deep into the Fields to Summarize Rich Harvest Experiences

    (Our Dispatch) Hunan Agricultural College teachers and students, establishing the idea of serving agricultural production, went deep into the fields and widely summarized the rich practical experience in agricultural production, which promoted production, enriched teaching content, and improved teaching quality.

    As early as 1958, Hunan Agricultural College sent more than 1,000 teachers and students to people's communes and state-owned farms. Through nearly a year of labor, they achieved triple harvests in ideology, labor, and teaching. In that year, teachers and students wrote 5,398 summaries of agricultural rich harvest experiences, investigation reports, and theses, and completed 1,544 scientific research projects. This year, under the guidance of the idea that the national economy takes agriculture as its foundation, the college party committee regarded supporting agriculture as a primary political task. They developed the experience of 1958, adopted a combination of teachers, students, and farmers, combined on-campus and off-campus efforts, and launched a mass movement to comprehensively and systematically summarize agricultural rich harvest experiences using various methods to promote agricultural production and improve teaching quality.

    This college first continued to organize teachers and students to go down to people's communes and state-owned farms to summarize agricultural rich harvest experiences through labor production. Some were dispatched for a longer period, and some for short-term investigation and research. In July this year, the college sent nearly 500 teachers and students to 28 counties in the province to widely summarize rich harvest experiences in various fields and collect data. The crop cultivation group of the agronomy department alone wrote more than 50 articles on crop cultivation experience and theses. At the beginning of this semester, teachers and students from four more majors were sent down to the countryside.

    Second, establish labor production bases on campus and implement the combination of teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. The college established a practice farm of more than 1,000 mu, and at the same time adopted the method of each class having three mu of land, with teachers and students contracting for production, labor, and measures, vigorously developing high-yield fields, and summarizing rich harvest experiences.

    Third, establish scientific research base points. Each teaching and research group was linked to a high-yield cooperative, comprehensively and promptly summarizing the rich harvest experiences of these communes. They also sent teachers and students to be stationed at fixed points for a long time, maintaining regular contact and constantly supplementing and developing these experiences. The agronomy department, horticulture department, and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine department established such points for rice, wheat, rapeseed, vegetables, cotton, and pig raising. The crop cultivation and cotton and hemp teaching and research groups of the agronomy department alone established six.

    Fourth, establish close contact with agricultural labor models from all aspects, and conscientiously learn and summarize the production experience of labor models. The college also hired 13 labor models as specially invited lecturers; for some labor models who lived far from the school, teachers and students took recording equipment to their workplaces to introduce their experiences on the spot, and then played the recordings for lectures. At the same time, teachers and students helped labor models to summarize and elevate practical production experience to theory.

    Whether summarizing agricultural rich harvest experiences on or off campus, the teachers and students of this college implemented the principle of "taking grain as the key link," focusing on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and paying attention to summarizing the experiences of large-scale increased production and high-yield harvests of crops, especially the rich harvest experiences of rice and wheat. The teachers and students of the crop cultivation teaching and research group, in coordination with relevant scientific research departments, went deep into Shaodong County, one of the main wheat-producing areas in the province, and summarized the experience of Heitianpu Commune in "selecting fine varieties, sowing in a timely manner, deep plowing and heavy fertilization, reasonable close planting, using soil to press the roots, and strengthening management," which enabled wheat to achieve large-scale rich harvests. This experience has now been widely promoted throughout the province, strongly promoting production.

    Summarizing the rich harvest experiences of the masses, analyzing and improving them theoretically, and then using them to guide production and enrich teaching content. This year, teachers and students used the rich data obtained from summarizing agricultural rich harvest experiences in the countryside to carry out the compilation of new teaching materials. Through major destruction and major establishment, they compiled more than 50 new textbooks with more than 10 million words, and established a new curriculum system. These new textbooks, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, reflect new technical achievements and rich harvest measures, and are more closely integrated with the actualities of agricultural production. Teachers and students of the cotton and hemp major of the agronomy department went deep into Huarong County and learned about the cotton planting experience of labor model Wu Daosheng, who advocated "protecting seedlings by first protecting roots, and cooling down before irrigation." They used dialectical materialism to analyze the scientific principles of this experience, stating that to protect seedlings, one must first do a good job in root fertilization, disease prevention, and waterlogging prevention. In the case of drought and high temperatures, cooling down must be done before irrigation.

    让教学有力地为农业生产服务
    湖南农学院师生深入田间总结丰产经验
    本报讯　湖南农学院师生树立为农业生产服务的思想，深入田间，广泛总结农业生产中的丰富的实际经验，促进了生产，同时丰富了教学内容，提高了教学质量。
    湖南农学院早在1958年就将一千余名师生下放到人民公社和国营农场，通过将近一年的劳动，获得了思想、劳动、教学三丰收，这一年师生写出农业丰产经验总结、调查报告、论文五千三百九十八篇，完成了科学研究项目一千五百四十四项。今年，学院党委在国民经济以农业为基础的思想指导下，将支援农业作为一项首要的政治任务。并发展了1958年的经验，采取教师、学生、农民三结合，校内与校外相结合，大搞群众运动，用多种方法全面地、系统地总结农业丰产经验，以促进农业生产，提高教学质量。
    这个学院首先是继续组织师生下放到人民公社和国营农场，通过劳动生产，总结农业丰产经验，他们有的是较长期的下放，有的是短期调查研究。今年7月，学院派出近五百名师生，分赴省内二十八个县，广泛总结各方面的丰产经验，搜集资料。单农学系作物栽培组就写出作物栽培经验、论文五十多篇。今年下学期开始，又有四个专业的师生下放农村。
    其次，在校内建立劳动生产基地，贯彻教学、生产劳动、科学研究三结合。学院建立了一个一千多亩的实习农场，同时采取每班三亩地，由师生包产、包工、包措施，大搞丰产田，总结丰产经验。
    第三、建立科学研究基点，各教研组与丰产社挂了钩，全面及时地总结这些公社的丰产经验。他们又派出师生长期驻点，经常联系，不断补充发展这些经验。农学系、园艺系、畜牧兽医系对于水稻、小麦、油菜、蔬菜、棉花、养猪等方面，都建立了这样的点，仅农学系作物栽培、棉麻两个教研组就建立了六个。
    第四、与各方面的农业劳动模范取得密切联系，认真学习和总结劳动模范的生产经验，学院还聘请了十三位劳动模范为特约讲师；有的劳动模范离校较远，师生就带着录音设备，请他们现场介绍经验，回来放送录音授课。同时师生们帮助劳动模范将实际生产经验，总结提高为理论。
    这个学院的师生，无论在校内或校外总结农业丰产经验，都贯彻了“以粮为纲”，以农业“八字宪法”为中心，注意总结农作物大面积增产和高额丰产经验，特别是水稻、小麦的丰产经验。作物栽培教研组的师生，与有关科学研究部门配合深入全省小麦主要产区之一的邵东县，总结了黑田铺公社“选用良种，适时播种，深耕多肥，合理密植，用土压兜，加强管理”的办法，使小麦获得大面积丰产的经验，现在已在全省普遍推广，有力的推动了生产。
    总结群众的丰产经验，从理论上加以分析提高，又反过来指导生产，丰富教学内容。今年来，师生运用下放农村中总结的农业丰产经验占有的丰富资料，进行了新教材的编写工作，通过大破大立，编写出五十多门、一千多万字的崭新教材，建立了新的课程体系。这些新的教材以毛泽东思想为指导，反映了新的技术成就、丰产措施，更密切地结合了农业生产实际。农学系棉麻专业的师生深入华容县，向种棉劳动模范吴道生了解“保苗先保根，灌溉先降温”的种棉经验后，运用唯物辩证法分析了这一经验的科学道理，保苗就必须先做好根的施肥、防病、防渍等工作。在干旱和高温的情况下，灌溉前必须做好降温工作。
