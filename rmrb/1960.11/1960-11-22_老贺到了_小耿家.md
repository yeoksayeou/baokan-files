　　　　　　　　Merging Teams
　　For three years, He Wenjie, the Party branch secretary of the Longwang Brigade in Ganduo Commune, Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, has always felt this way: on the one hand, he felt that Longwang was getting better year by year, turning from a poor team to a rich team; on the other hand, seeing that the neighboring Little Geng's home was falling behind year by year, he always felt that he had not fulfilled his responsibility. This year, at the provincial conference of advanced agricultural representatives, hearing that this advanced team helped the backward team, and that the rich team led the poor team, he felt even more uneasy. He thought: "To run the people's commune well, to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule, one Longwang Brigade is not enough, there must be more Longwang Brigades." He made up his mind: he must help Little Geng's home turn over. After returning from Nanjing, he proposed his suggestion to the commune Party committee and revealed his feelings to the cadres and masses of the Longwang Brigade. Most people applauded and agreed to merge with Little Geng's home.
　　One day, Old He raised the question at a mass meeting: "Why can the Longwang Brigade turn over?" and asked everyone to discuss it. The Longwang Brigade is a "bottom concave" in the Lixiahe area. Before liberation, more than half of the families went to Jiangnan every year to work and beg for food. When organizing the cooperative, poor Longwang only had "three immovables": three skinny cows that couldn't walk, three broken windmills that couldn't turn, and eighteen broken boats that couldn't be propped up. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the state, through the hard work and practical work of Old He and the broad masses of cadres and people, Longwang has changed greatly: the three skinny cows that couldn't walk have become eighteen strong cows; the three windmills that couldn't turn have become seventeen new windmills; and the eighteen broken boats have become thirty-six brand new boats. Grain output has increased year after year, and the yield of more than 1,500 mu of land has increased from 200 jin per mu to 450 jin. Everyone said: "We must help Little Geng's home catch up."
　　After the suggestion of merging the teams was approved by the higher-level Party committee, Old He was going to settle in Little Geng's home. The masses of the Longwang Brigade came to see him off reluctantly. Poor peasant Wang Guifang repeatedly urged: "Old He, this time you are sailing against the wind, you must hold the rudder steady, rely on the poor brothers, and be careful not to be hooked by bad people. If you have any difficulties, just send a message, and we will definitely support you."
　　　　　　　　Conspiracy
　　As soon as Old He arrived at Little Geng's home, he walked around the village three times: he went to the fields to see the production, to the canteens to see the living conditions, and to the homes of the masses to listen to their reflections. He saw that under the big sun, there were sparse people working in the fields, a few boats were parked by the river, and only one of the three canteens was smoking.
　　At noon, accountant Geng Guangxi greeted him with a smile and said: "Secretary He, today is the day the new official takes office, please come to my house for a simple meal." Old He went to his house and saw five or six dishes on the table, including fish, meat, eggs, and a few bottles of wine. He felt very uncomfortable at the time and said unceremoniously: "Everyone in the canteen is talking about saving, why do you prepare so many dishes!" He turned around and walked to the canteen.
　　In the evening, a welcome meeting for Old He was held at Gengjia Elementary School. The tea and cigarettes on the rostrum were full. Geng Jingyi, who had been a township head and branch secretary, was the first to speak: "Today I heard that Secretary He is coming, so I came here to welcome him. In the past few years, Longwang has turned over, all thanks to Secretary He's leadership. With him coming to our Little Geng's home, we will definitely turn over quickly." Then Geng Guangxue, another demoted team leader, spoke. He said: "The production of Little Geng's home has been falling behind in the past two years, and the members are not in the mood. I have no choice but to do some small business with a few boats to make a living. With Secretary He coming, there will be a way, and I will not do this business anymore." Some people sitting under the stage leaned against the corners of the wall and dozed off, while others shook their heads as they listened. Old He listened to the speeches of the people on the stage and looked at the expressions of the masses under the stage, and thought: This meeting is not right!
　　As soon as the meeting was over, Old He squeezed into the crowd and heard some people say: "It's better to sleep at home and recuperate than to attend this meeting today." "One monkey left and another Sun came, and the one surnamed He is still on the same bench as them." Geng Jingyi followed Old He closely, wanting Old He to sit at his home. Old He didn't want to go at first, but in order to understand their situation, he went anyway. As soon as he arrived at Geng Jingyi's "East Mansion", Geng Jingyi's wife served tea and cigarettes, and was extremely attentive. While talking, Old He saw a black shadow flash outside the door, and asked: "Who is it?" "Me, Geng Guangqu." Guangqu left the room without smoking half a cigarette. Old He stayed at Geng's house, chatting endlessly, until almost midnight. Geng Jingyi's wife pointed to the neatly made bed and said: "It's inconvenient for you to get up early and work in the dark alone, so sleep here!" She also said: "It's getting late, let me get you something to eat." As she said this, she went to wash the rice and beat the eggs. Old He said: "I'm not used to eating a late-night snack." As he spoke, he stepped out of the gate, and ran into Guangqu again outside the door. Guangqu said in a rough voice: "You have a bed and don't sleep, you have wine and don't drink, what are you doing!"
　　That night, Old He tossed and turned, unable to sleep, with two question marks in his mind: Why are Geng Jingyi and his gang so attentive to me? Why are the poor and lower-middle peasants so indifferent to me? He had also heard that some cadres, as soon as they arrived at Little Geng's home, would lie down as soon as they settled down in the "East Mansion". The more Old He thought about it, the more he felt that the masses' indifference to him was based on the suspicion that he was sitting on the same bench as the Geng family? The important question now is how to make the masses trust him. He also thought of the spring of 1955, when Comrade Yang Dianru of the District Committee led a working group to the Longwang Brigade to sleep in thatched sheds and eat soybean cakes, which enlightened him and the class consciousness of his poor brothers. It was at that time that he became a backbone member of the cooperative and joined the Communist Party. Since then, he has closely relied on his class brothers and transformed the poor Longwang into a rich Longwang. Now, to turn Little Geng's home over, he must take root among the poor and lower-middle peasants.
　　　　　　　　Taking Root
　　The next morning, Old He carried his shovel and went down to the marsh to dig mud. After shoveling a boatload back, poor peasant Yan Guilin was very surprised. It was not a novelty for the brigade secretary to dig mud, but it was indeed a strange thing in Little Geng's home. Yan Guilin immediately jumped on the boat and went to dig mud with Old He. On the mud-digging boat, Old He talked about the turnaround of Longwang. Yan Guilin said: "It would be great if you could lead our Little Geng's home like you did in Longwang!" The next day, Old He went down to the marsh with an empty boat early in the morning, and there were already three boats digging mud. Old He and them shoveled and talked, and everyone talked very enthusiastically, and even the words "in the grass" were brought out. On the third day, there were eleven boats going down to the marsh to dig mud and collect slag, and Old He was still with them.
　　Old He saw that the canteen of the Fifth Team was in a mess, and it took half a day to cook a meal, so he took the time to cook himself. As soon as he became a cook, he found the root cause of why the canteen was not well run. Originally, among the six cooks in the three canteens of Little Geng's home, one was Geng Jingyi's wife, one was a landlord who was missed during the class division, and one was Geng Guangxue's sister-in-law. The masses said they were "eating in their mouths and stealing in their hands". After clarifying the situation, he discussed with the masses and cleaned out these three people and replaced them with three poor peasant activists. When the canteen was short of rice, he personally went to Longwang to borrow it; when the stove was broken, he brought two masons from Longwang to repair it; when there were no seeds for growing melons and vegetables, he helped them find ways to find them. In this way, the three canteens were rectified.
　　Old He made close friends by grasping production and life. Old He heard that Geng Decai was sick, and immediately inquired about it, but accountant Geng Guangxi said that he was a thief, a dismissed cadre, and was pretending to be sick at home. Old He didn't believe it, so he personally went to Decai's home to see. The first time he went, Decai said: "We are white-necked crows - speaking is a disaster, don't be nagging." He couldn't talk anymore. The second time he went, he saw that Decai's house was collapsed, so he took the initiative to move the soil base to repair the wall with Decai's wife. Old He said to her while doing it: "Decai's illness is serious, we have to find a way to send him to Xinghua for treatment." Decai's wife was moved to tears. Old He personally found a boat and sent Decai to Xinghua for treatment. Decai was so excited that he held Old He's hand and said: "You are more considerate than my own brother." He told Old He everything that was in his heart. Decai was originally the team leader of the agricultural cooperative and often struggled with Geng Jingyi, a local tyrant who had been riding on the heads of the people for a long time, and others who engaged in sabotage activities. In 1958, he was dismissed for exposing their private embezzlement of more than 20,000 jin of grain. Since then, he has been hit and squeezed out by them. When Decai was sick, he wanted to weigh a few jin of rice, but Geng Guangxi said fiercely to him: "Your problem has not been clarified yet, and you want to eat rice?" Decai thought: "You eat more than 70 jin of rice a month, and I can't even adjust a few jin of rice." He couldn't bear it, so he took the sieve to the canteen and weighed a few jin of rice by force. They fought against Decai as a thief, and Decai's illness became more serious in anger. Now Old He is so kind to him, how can he not be excited?
　　Poor peasant Geng Dexiu, who was a duck herder, was forced by Geng Jingyi, Geng Guangxue, and Geng Guangxi to sell coffins once. They threatened Dexiu and said: "If you do bad things, the one surnamed He will deal with you!" In front of Old He, they said that Dexiu had done many bad things. In fact, Old He had already learned all the details of Dexiu from Yan Guilin, so he took the initiative to find Dexiu and helped him build a duck pen. After more than a dozen conversations, he made a close friend with Dexiu.
　　On March 20th, Old He went to the field to check the production. Geng Guangqu, who had been watching Old He's movements at the "East Mansion" when Old He first arrived at Little Geng's home, invited Old He onto the boat. Guangqu said: "Old He, I said something offensive at the 'East Mansion', I'm sorry to you." Old He smiled and said: "You were right to be afraid that I would be hooked by them." Guangqu is a true poor peasant who always takes the lead in everything. Last autumn, when he was watching the threshing ground, thousands of jin of rice were stolen and sold by Geng Jingyi and others, but they turned around and accused Geng Guangqu of stealing and selling it, and fought against Guangqu for three days. Guangqu said to Old He: "Bad people are in power, treating good people as bad people; I wanted to leave Little Geng's home, but after seeing you came and do everything for our poor brothers, I don't want to leave anymore." The two talked very speculatively, and finally Guangqu said to Old He: "I am a bachelor, move to my house!" Once, Old He went to the commune Party committee to attend a meeting. When the meeting was over, it was already dark and it was raining heavily. Old He was about to run back in the rain when Guangqu had already sailed the boat to pick him up.
　　One night in early May, thunder rumbled and wind and rain raged. Old He and brigade leader Wang Qingyao rushed from Longwang to Little Geng's home, preparing to mobilize the masses to drain the water. On the way, they suddenly saw lights in the field. They thought it was someone catching fish, so they called out: "Who is catching fish?" A reply came from the opposite side: "It's not catching fish, it's opening the gaps to release water." When they got closer, they found that it was Guangqu, Dexiu, and other activists who were draining the water. Guangqu said: "Why did you come in such heavy rain, we have already opened all the gaps." Old He said to Wang Qingyao with emotion: "Look, after all, it's the poor peasants!"
　　　　　　　　Counterattack
　　The enthusiasm of the masses in Little Geng's home is getting higher and higher day by day, and the production upsurge is getting higher and higher day by day, while the gang of bad guys Geng Jingyi, Geng Guangxue, and Geng Guangxi regard Old He as a thorn in their side. When people are asleep, they hold secret meetings, plotting the conspiracy of sabotage activities. Geng Jingyi is the mastermind, he said: "Since the one surnamed He came, he has been forcing us step by step. If we don't strike first to bring him down, we will end up losing both people and money. I have a plan to bring down the one surnamed He. Now there is an outstanding carrot account, which has not been settled. We collude with a few people to make trouble, saying that the carrot money was swallowed by the one surnamed He and them. If we make such a disturbance, production will stop, and the higher-ups will definitely come to deal with the one surnamed He. Once the one surnamed He leaves, Little Geng's home will be ours again." The others praised him repeatedly.
　　During the day, this group of people scurries around like mice; at night, they kill chickens and geese, eating and drinking lavishly. Rumors spread: "The carrot money has been swallowed by the cadres." "Chickens and ducks are about to be concentrated." "……".
　　One day, they gathered a few backward people and surrounded Old He, saying fiercely: "The one surnamed He, after you came to Little Geng's home, where did you put the carrot money of the members!" Old He did not panic and pointed at Geng Jingyi and others and said: "Do you want to settle accounts? Last year, more than 200 mu of land was not planted, and more than 600 mu of rice suffered from grass and weeds, reducing the yield. This account has not been settled with you yet, but you have come to the door!" After saying that, he pointed at a basket of fields and said to everyone: "Members, three harvests are reaped when the yellow seedlings are planted on the ground. Now the season is tight, and they are inciting trouble at this time, wanting the lives of our people in Little Geng's home, don't be fooled by them! The carrot account is on them, settle it with them." These words made many people nod in agreement. Member Geng Guangjin nodded and said: "Old He is right, the account is on them, settle it with them." Some also said: "Making trouble during the busy season is like smashing our own pot, let's go back and focus on production." The conspiracy of these bad guys to sabotage production was defeated in front of the bright eyes of the masses.
　　That night, Geng Dexiu ran over in a hurry and said to Old He: "Geng Jingyi came to win me over, saying that the two Geng characters in Little Geng's home cannot be written with one stroke, Geng's affairs should be handled by the Geng family, don't let the one surnamed He and the people of Longwang manage. They want to squeeze you out, we have to think of a way quickly." Old He said: "You continue to monitor their actions, I will go to the commune Party committee to ask for instructions." Old He went to the commune Party committee secretary in the rain overnight. The Party committee secretary encouraged him and said: "Now our work is easier to do, the tiger has come out of the cave, it is easier to fight, the problem is that we need to further mobilize the masses and completely isolate them." He repeatedly urged Old He and said: "Now the most important thing is to rush to plant the mid-season rice. Their request to settle accounts is false, sabotaging production is true. If production stops, it will fall right into their trap." Old He felt that there was a pillar supporting him behind him after listening, and he was full of energy, and said happily: "It's not that they are holding our throats, but that we are holding their throats!"
　　　　　　　　Catching Ghosts
　　The rush planting of mid-season rice in Little Geng's home was completed, and the struggle was also brewing to maturity. On the evening of May 19th, the five large rooms of Gengjia Elementary School were about to be crowded. Men and women, old and young, all came to participate in the struggle meeting with excitement and excitement. In the struggle, everyone scrambled to accuse. Geng Dexiu pointed at those bad guys and said: "It is you who have made Little Geng's home uneasy and oppressed us without any freedom. Geng Jingyi's family has a cow that ran behind my house and ate my vegetables. I pulled it, but he slapped me a few times. Also, the matter of selling coffins was forced on me by you, and you came to slander me. Fortunately, Old He has bright eyes, otherwise I would have been wronged and died in your hands. Old He wants to help us turn over, but you deliberately stir up trouble. Today we must beat down your prestige!" Geng Dehui said even more angrily: "These guys eat people without spitting out bones. In 1955, when I was the village head, I didn't give the loan to Geng Jingyi, so they colluded with Lu Fude and dismissed me. Geng Jingyi's family raises ducks that eat the rice in the fields. When I went to chase them away, they stopped my meals. They do all kinds of evil, just because we haven't raised our heads yet. Today we have risen up, we must catch all these ghosts." Zhang Caiyuan, who had been won over by those bad elements to surround Old He, said: "Your conspiracy is really big! My furniture was tricked and sold by you, saying that you would give me carrots, but later I didn't even see a shadow of carrots, but you tricked me into saying that the money was in the brigade and was embezzled by Old He, and dragged me to make trouble. Today I see through your black heart." Some members brought out the rotten carrots that they could not eat and said: "Everyone see, they said they wanted to run the canteen well and help us arrange our lives, but they brought back rotten stuff. The money went into their pockets, but they accused Old He."
　　The meeting lasted from evening until the rooster crowed, and people still wanted to continue speaking. Old He stood up and said seriously: "Members, today's meeting is like a mirror, exposing all these demons and ghosts. Today we have caught the ghosts, Little Geng's home will definitely jump out of the concave pond and climb the high mountain!"
　　Demons and ghosts are most afraid of the sun, and the sharpness of the mass struggle is even stronger than the power of the sun. At this struggle meeting, the ugly faces of these demons and ghosts were exposed one by one.
　　It turned out that they were such a gang of bad guys:
　　Geng Jingyi, a traitor to the Party, used to be a loafer who did not do his job properly. He joined the Party in 1944 and served as the township head and Party branch secretary. He was dismissed in the land reform struggle for sheltering the landlord; he surrendered to the enemy in 1946; and in 1949, he reappeared as a poor peasant and hid his in-law, the bandit security chief Yang Baolin, at home for ten years. He regards himself as the patriarch of the Geng family and has become the tyrant of Little Geng's home. Together with Geng Guangxue and Geng Guangxi, they deceive those above and oppress those below, and do all kinds of evil. All major and minor affairs in the village must be reported to him. Every year they steal and privately divide collective grain. In 1958 alone, they privately divided more than 20,000 jin. Last year, the rice seeds issued by the higher authorities had 35 jin per mu. After they stole and sold them, only 16 jin per mu were left. As a result, there were not enough seeds, and 200 mu of land were not planted. In the past few years, many cadres have been won over and corrupted by him. Before the merger, he tried every means to bring down the canteen. After the merger, he incited the masses to make trouble.
　　Geng Guangxue, a class alien element, participated in the Three People's Principles Youth League. He was the production team leader in 1958, but was dismissed for participating in the private division of grain, so he has been doing speculative business. One month before the merger this year, he sold the furniture and cloth certificates of the masses in the name of buying radishes for the canteen, and also sold a farm boat from the team, buying soap, cigarettes and other materials. After Old He went there, he instigated his brother to sabotage production.
　　Geng Guangxi, joined the army in 1944, deserted and came back, and became a cadre again. After liberation, he followed behind Geng Jingyi; in 1955, when the cooperative was established, he was recommended by Geng Jingyi to be the accountant because he was educated. The masses said that he was a "land mine" placed by Geng Jingyi inside. He has a share in everything from privately dividing grain, embezzling collective property, to doing speculative business. At the end of last year, there was a division of teams, and 200 geese were divided. Before and after the merger, he ate more than 30 geese by himself, and ate more than 70 jin of rice every month.
　　　　　　　　Jubilation
　　The evil forces have been defeated, and Little Geng's home is jubilant! The progress of production is like the mercury column on a thermometer in the hot weather, rising in a straight line. On the second day after the struggle, the Seventh Team put all the weed pond mud from more than 20 mu of land into the fields in one night. On the same night, the Sixth Team carried more than 100 dan of manure to the fields. Old He personally led the commando team, camped in the fields, weeding and topdressing went hand in hand, and topdressed and weeded all the third-class seedlings in nearly 300 mu of land. The members said: "We have removed the hats of the third-class teams, and we have also removed the hats of the third-class seedlings." Last year, nearly 200 mu of land in Little Geng's home were abandoned. This year, not only was there not a single mu of abandoned land, but also more than 40 mu of wasteland were reclaimed and planted with arrowhead. Geng Guangli, who is more than sixty years old, sat on the windmill pile and happily watched a good crop. He met Old He and said affectionately: "When bad people are in power, the ground is full of weeds; when good people are in charge, the fields are full of crops. Look, which year has grown such good rice, the ears are like dog tails." Poor peasant Geng Guangren said: "In the past, I didn't want to go home when I was out, but now I never want to go out when I'm at home."

    老贺到了“小耿家”
    李晓辉　谭暄
            并　队
    三年来，江苏省高邮县甘垛公社龙王大队的党支部书记贺文杰总是怀着这样的心情：一方面感到龙王一年一年好起来，穷队变富队；一方面看到邻队小耿家一年一年落后下去，总感到自己没有尽到责任。今年，他在省农业先进代表会上，听到这个先进队帮了落后队，那个富队带了穷队，内心就更加不安起来。他想：“要办好人民公社，要提前实现农业发展纲要，一个龙王大队不行，要有更多的龙王大队。”他下定决心：一定要帮助小耿家翻过身来。从南京回来，他边向公社党委提出自己的建议，边向龙王大队干部群众透露了自己的心情，大多数人都拍手赞成和小耿家合并。
    一天，老贺在群众大会上提出：“龙王大队为什么能翻身？”让大家讨论。龙王大队是里下河的一个“锅底凹”，解放前，每年有一大半人家上江南做工、讨饭。组织合作社时，穷龙王只有“三不动”：三条走不动的瘦牛，三部转不动的坏风车，十八条撑不动的破船。几年来，在党的领导和国家支持下，经过老贺和广大干部群众的苦干实干，龙王大大变了样：三条走不动的瘦牛，变成了十八条壮牛；三部转不动的风车，变成了十七部新风车；十八条破船，变成了三十六条黄堂堂的新船。粮食产量年年上升，一千五百多亩田，由每亩二百斤产量上升到四百五十斤。大家说：“我们一定要帮助小耿家跟上来。”
    并队的建议得到上级党委批准后，老贺要到小耿家落户了。龙王大队的群众都依依不舍地前来送行。贫农王桂芳再三叮嘱说：“老贺，你这次去，是逆风行船，舵要掌得稳，要靠穷兄弟，谨防上坏人的钩。有什么困难，只要捎个信来，我们一定来撑腰。”
            阴　谋
    老贺一到小耿家，就在庄里庄外转了三转：转到田头看生产，转到食堂看生活，转到群众家里听反映。他看看大太阳天，田里劳动的人稀稀朗朗，几条船停在河边，三个食堂只有一个冒烟。
    中午，会计耿广熙迎上来笑着说：“贺书记，今天是新官上任，请到我家吃顿便饭。”老贺到他家一看，桌上摆了五、六样菜，有鱼有肉有蛋，还有几瓶酒，当时心里很不舒服，不客气地说：“食堂里大家都在讲节约，你为什么办这样多的菜！”拔脚就往食堂走去。
    晚间，在耿家小学，开了个欢迎老贺的大会。主席台上茶呀烟呀摆得满满的。当过乡长和支部书记的耿景宜第一个讲话说：“今天听说贺支书来，我特地赶来欢迎。这几年龙王翻了身，这都是贺支书领导有方。我们小耿家有他来，也一定翻得快。”接着是另一个被撤了职的小队长耿广学讲话，他说：“小耿家这两年生产搞得落下来了，社员弄得没情绪，我没有办法，只好弄几条船去做小本生意，混混嘴。贺支书来，就有办法了，我也不做这个倒头生意了。”坐在台下的人，有的倚在墙角打瞌睡，有的听了直摇头。老贺听听台上人的讲话，看看台下群众的表情，心想：这个会不大对头啊！
    一散会，老贺就挤到人群中去，听到有的人说：“今天开这个会，不如在家睡觉养精神。”“走掉一个猴子又来一个姓孙的，姓贺的还是他们一条板凳上的人。”耿景宜紧跟着老贺，要老贺到他家去坐坐。老贺本来不想去，但为了了解他们的情况，还是去了。一到耿景宜家的“东家门楼”，耿景宜的老婆端茶送烟，殷勤备至。谈话的当儿，老贺看到门外有个黑影子一闪，就问：“哪一个？”“我，耿广曲。”广曲进屋没吸到半支烟就走了。老贺在耿家，七扯八拉，快到半夜了。耿景宜的老婆指着铺得干干净净的床铺说：“你一个人起早摸黑不方便，就在这里睡吧！”又说：“时间不早了，给你弄点吃的。”说着，就去淘米打蛋。老贺说：“我这个人，吃不惯夜顿子。”边说边跨出大门，门外又碰到了广曲。广曲粗里粗气地说：“有床不睡，有酒不喝，才呆哩！”
    这天夜里，老贺翻来复去睡不着，脑子里打了两个问号：为什么耿景宜这班人对我如此殷勤？为什么贫、下中农对我如此冷淡？他过去也曾听说过，有些干部一到小耿家，在“东家门楼”一落脚就躺倒了。老贺越想，越感到群众对他的冷淡是有根据的，怀疑他是不是跟耿家坐在一条板凳上了？眼下重要的问题，是如何使群众信任他。他又想到1955年的春天，区委杨殿如同志带一个工作组到龙王大队睡茅棚，吃豆饼，启发他和穷兄弟的阶级觉悟，就在那时，他成了办社骨干，参加了共产党。以后，他紧紧地依靠了阶级兄弟，把穷龙王变成了富龙王。现在，要把小耿家翻过身来，一定要到贫农、下中农当中扎下根去。
            扎　根
    第二天一大早，老贺就扛起?子，下荡?泥。?好一船回来，贫农严桂林看了很惊奇。大队支书?泥，本来不是新奇的事，但是在小耿家确是一件奇事。严桂林随即跳上船，跟老贺一道去?泥。就在?泥船上，老贺谈起了龙王翻身情况。严桂林说：“你能像在龙王一样，领导我们小耿家就好了！”第二天，老贺一早又撑了一条空船下荡，那边已有三条船?起泥来了。老贺和他们一边?，一边说，大家谈得很热火，“草棵里”的话都捧出来了。第三天，就有十一条船下荡?泥取渣，老贺还是和他们在一起。
    老贺看到第五小队的食堂乱糟糟，一顿饭要烧半天，他就抽空去亲自烧锅。一当炊事员，就找到了食堂办不好的根子。原来小耿家的三个食堂，六个炊事员中，一个是耿景宜的老婆，一个是划阶级时漏划的地主，一个是耿广学的嫂子，群众说他们是“嘴里吃，手里偷”。情况摸清了，他和群众一商量，就把这三个人清洗出去，换了三个贫农积极分子，食堂缺米，他就亲自到龙王去借；锅灶坏了，他又到龙王带两个瓦工来修理；种瓜菜没种子，他又帮助他们设法去找。就这样把三个食堂整顿好了。
    老贺通过抓生产、抓生活，广交知心朋友。老贺听说耿德才有病，随即查问，会计耿广熙却说他是小偷，是撤职干部，在家装病。老贺不相信，就亲自到德才家去看看。第一次去，德才说：“我们是白颈项老鸦——开口是祸，你不要噜嗦。”没有谈得下去。第二次他又去，看到德才家墙倒了，他就主动和德才妻搬土基修墙。老贺边做边对她说：“德才的病重，我们要想办法把他送到兴化去治。”德才妻感动得热泪直流。老贺亲自找好了船，把德才送上兴化去看病。德才激动得拉着老贺的手说：“你比我的亲兄弟还贴心。”他把闷在心里的话，全部向老贺谈出来。德才原是农业社的小队长，经常和长期骑在人民头上的坐地虎耿景宜等破坏活动进行斗争，1958年曾因揭发他们私吞二万多斤粮食，被他们撤了职。从此，受到他们的打击排挤。德才生病时，想秤几斤大米，耿广熙狠狠地对他说：“你的问题还没有搞清楚，倒想吃大米啦？”德才想：“你一个月就吃七十多斤米，我调剂几斤米都不能。”气不过，就拿了淘箩到食堂硬秤了几斤米。他们就把德才当小偷斗争，德才一气病更重了。如今老贺对他这样亲热，他怎能不激动呢？
    贫农耿德修，是个放鸭的，耿景宜、耿广学、耿广熙曾逼迫他去倒卖过一次棺材，他们威胁德修说：“你做了坏事，姓贺的要办你！”在老贺面前，他们又说德修作了很多坏事。其实，老贺早在严桂林那里了解了德修的全部底细，就主动去找德修，帮他垒鸭圈，经过前后十多次谈话，和德修交了知心朋友。
    3月20日，老贺下田检查生产，曾在“东家门楼”看老贺初到小耿家时动静的耿广曲，把老贺请到船上。广曲说：“老贺，在‘东家门楼’，我说了冲头话，对不起你。”老贺笑笑说：“你怕我上他们的钩，完全作得对。”广曲是个道地的贫农，什么事情都走在前头。去年秋天看场，场上有几千斤稻子被耿景宜他们偷卖了，反咬是耿广曲偷卖的，把广曲斗争了三天。广曲对老贺说：“坏人当道，把好人当坏人；我本想离开小耿家，看你来了以后处处为我们穷兄弟办事，我也不想走了。”两人说得很投机，最后广曲对老贺说：“我是单身汉，你搬到我家住吧！”有一次，老贺到公社党委会去开会，会散的时候，天已黑了，又下着大雨，老贺正要冒雨跑回去，这时广曲已撑船来接他了。
    5月上旬的一个夜里，雷声隆隆，风雨交加。老贺和大队长王庆耀由龙王赶到小耿家，准备动员群众排涝。走到半路上，忽然看到田里有灯火，他们以为是取鱼的，就叫了一声：“哪个在取鱼？”对面传来了回声：“不是取鱼的，是开缺放水的。”走近一看，原来是广曲、德修等几个积极分子在那里排涝。广曲说：“你们怎么冒这样大的雨来，我们已经把缺子全部开好了。”老贺感动地对王庆耀说：“你看，说来说去，到底是贫农！”
            反　扑
    小耿家的群众干劲一天大似一天，生产热潮一天高似一天，而耿景宜、耿广学、耿广熙那一帮坏家伙，把老贺当作眼中钉。当人们熟睡的时候，他们就召开秘密会议，策划着破坏活动的阴谋。耿景宜是主谋者，他说：“姓贺的来了以后，就一步紧似一步地逼着我们，我们如果不先下手揪倒他，就会落得个人财两空。要揪倒姓贺的，我有一计。现在有一笔胡萝卜账，没有算清，我们串通几个人起来闹，就说胡萝卜钱被姓贺的他们吞吃了。这样一闹，生产就要停下来，上面一定要来处理姓贺的，姓贺的一走，小耿家又是我们的了。”其他人连连称赞。
    白天，这批人就像老鼠一样，到处乱窜；晚上，他们杀鸡杀鹅，大吃大喝。谣言传出来了：“胡萝卜钱被干部吞吃了。”“鸡鸭马上要集中了。”“……”。
    有一天，他们拉拢几个落后的人围住老贺，凶狠狠地说：“姓贺的，你到小耿家以后，把社员的胡萝卜钱弄哪里去了！”老贺不慌不忙，指着耿景宜等说：“是要算账吗？去年二百多亩田没有种，六百多亩水稻发生草荒，减了产，这笔账还没有和你们清算，你们倒找上门来啊！”说罢，他又指着一匡田对大家说：“社员们，黄秧落地三分收，现在季节要紧，他们在这个时候煽动闹事，是想要我们小耿家人的命，千万不要上他们的当！胡萝卜账就在他们身上，要算和他们算。”这一番话，说得许多人点头称是。社员耿广金点着头说：“老贺说得对啊，账就在他们身上，要和他们算。”也有的说：“大忙闹事，等于捣自己的锅，还是回去好好搞生产。”这些坏家伙破坏生产的阴谋，就在群众雪亮的眼前遭到了失败。
    这天晚上，耿德修急匆匆跑来，对老贺说：“耿景宜来拉拢我，说什么小耿家一笔写不出两个耿字来，耿家事耿家办，不要姓贺的和龙王人来管。他们要把你挤走，我们得赶紧想办法。”老贺说：“你们继续监视他们的行动，我马上去请示公社党委。”老贺连夜冒雨去找公社党委书记，党委书记鼓励他说：“现在我们工作更好作了，老虎出洞了，反而好打，问题是需要我们进一步把群众发动起来，彻底孤立他们。”他又再三叮嘱老贺说：“现在最要紧的是把中稻抢栽下去，他们要求算账是假的，破坏生产是真的，如果生产停了，正中了他们的鬼计。”老贺听了感到身后有了一根柱子撑着，浑身添了劲，高兴地说：“不是他们卡住我们的喉咙，而是我们卡住了他们的喉咙！”
              捉　鬼
    小耿家的中稻抢栽结束了，斗争也酝酿成熟了。5月19日晚上，耿家小学的五间大屋，快要被挤破了。男男女女，老老少少，都怀着兴奋、激动的心情，来参加斗争大会。在斗争中，个个争先控诉。耿德修指着那些坏家伙说：“就是你们把小耿家搞得鸡犬不宁，压得我们没得一点自由。耿景宜家有一条牛，跑到我家屋后吃了我的菜，我牵了一下，反打了我几个耳光。再说卖棺材的事，是你们逼着我干的，还来诬告我，幸亏老贺眼睛亮，不然我又冤死在你们的手里。老贺要帮助我们翻身，你们却偏偏兴风作浪，今天一定要把你们的威风打下去！”耿德惠更气愤地说：“这些家伙，吃人不吐骨头。1955年我当村长，没有把贷款给耿景宜，他们串通陆富德，把我撤了职。耿景宜家里养鸭子吃田里的稻子，我去赶一下，还停我的伙。他们为非作歹，就是因为我们头还没有抬起来，今天我们起来了，一定要把这些鬼捉净。”曾被那些坏分子拉拢包围老贺的张才元说：“你们阴谋真大！我的家具被你们骗卖掉了，说要给我胡萝卜，后来连个胡萝卜影子也没有见到，反而骗我说，钱摆在大队，被老贺贪污了，拖我去闹事。今天我看透了你们的黑心肠。”当场有些社员把他们贩回来不能吃的烂萝卜捧出来说：“大家看，他们口口声声为了办好食堂，帮助我们安排生活，搞回来都是烂家伙，钱上了他们腰包，反咬老贺一口。”
    大会由晚上一直开到鸡叫，人们还要讲下去。老贺站起来，严肃地说：“社员们，今天大会好比照妖镜，把这些妖魔鬼怪都照出来了。今天我们把鬼捉了，小耿家定能跳出凹塘登高山！”
    妖魔鬼怪最怕太阳，而群众斗争的锋芒，比太阳光的威力还强。在这次斗争大会上，这些妖魔鬼怪的丑恶面目，被一一揭露出来了。
    原来他们是这样一伙坏家伙：
    耿景宜，党的叛徒，过去是不务正业的二流子，1944年混入党内，当过乡长和党支部书记，土改斗争中因包庇地主被撤职；1946年向敌人自首叛变；1949年又以贫农身份出现，并把他的亲家、匪保长杨宝林窝藏在家达十年之久。他以耿家族长自居，成为小耿家的霸头，和耿广学、耿广熙一起，瞒上压下，为非作歹，庄上大事小事都要请示他。每年他们都盗窃私分集体的粮食，仅1958年就私分了两万多斤，去年上面发的稻种每亩有三十五斤，他们盗卖以后，每亩只剩下十六斤，结果种子不够，有二百亩田没有栽下去。几年来，许多干部被他拉拢腐蚀。并队前，他千方百计搞垮食堂，并队后，又煽动群众闹事。
    耿广学，阶级异己分子，参加过三青团。1958年当生产小队长，因参加私分粮食被撤职，就一直做投机生意，今年并队前一个月，以购买萝卜办食堂为名，贩卖群众的家具和布证，又卖掉队里的农船一只，套购肥皂、香烟等物资。老贺去了以后，他又唆使他的哥哥破坏生产。
    耿广熙，1944年参军，开小差回来，又当了干部。解放以后，跟在耿景宜后面跑；1955年办社时，因为他有文化，被耿景宜推荐当会计。群众说他是耿景宜在内部安置的一个“地雷”。私分粮食，贪污集体财富，做投机生意样样都有他的份。去年年底，闹分队，分掉二百只鹅。他在并队前后，一个人就吃掉三十多只鹅，每月要吃七十多斤大米。
            欢　腾
    恶势力斗垮了，小耿家欢腾起来了！生产的进度，就像大伏天温度表上的水银柱一样，直线上升。第七小队在斗争后的第二天，一个晚上就把二十多亩田的草塘泥，全部下了田。同一天晚上，第六小队就把一百多担粪挑到田里。老贺亲自带领突击队，田头扎营，锄草追肥双管齐下，把近三百亩田的三类苗全部追了肥，锄了草。社员们说：“我们三类队的帽子摘掉了，三类苗的帽子也摘掉了。”去年小耿家，抛荒近二百亩田，今年不但没有一亩荒田，而且开垦了四十多亩荒滩，栽上了慈菇。八百五十亩水稻，长得和龙王不分上下。六十多岁的耿广礼坐在风车垛上，喜看一片好庄稼。他碰到老贺亲热地说：“坏人当道，满地草荒，好人当家，满田庄稼，你看哪一年长过这样好稻，穗子像狗尾巴一样。”贫农耿广仁说：“过去出外不想家，现在在家再也不想出外了。”
