Column: Red Hearts for the Collective

    The members of the Dongwu Village Production Team of Jiangzhen Commune in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, praise their female canteen administrator, Cui Guilan, to anyone who will listen. Because she serves everyone wholeheartedly, she runs the canteen excellently and has become a female standard-bearer on the county's canteen front, gloriously joining the Chinese Communist Party.
    When Cui Guilan first arrived at the canteen, she didn't know how to keep accounts or use an abacus... With the help of Cui Daoli, the secretary of the management district party branch, she resolved to learn. In order to process coarse grains carefully, she went to other canteens to consult with her peers. The canteen had over two hundred people eating, and the administrative work alone was enough to keep her busy, but she put this work off until the evening, and during the day she was either feeding pigs or carrying water. During the busy farming season, she and the cooks worked extra hard to find ways to make everyone eat to their satisfaction. Recently, the members have been rushing to pull up cotton stalks, so she and the cooks have been trying their best to make delicious dishes such as deep-fried vegetable balls and fried tofu, so that the members eat well and work hard. The four hundred mu of cotton stalks were all cleanly pulled up in less than ten days.
    She is kind and cares for others more than she cares for herself. She knows exactly who likes to eat salty, who likes to eat bland, and who likes to eat soft among all the people eating in the canteen, and she tries her best to meet everyone's requirements. If someone doesn't come to eat, she always asks to find out why. Once, old man Wang Sixiang, who grows melons, fell ill, and Cui Guilan brought him meals home three times a day. The old man said gratefully: "The public canteen is the warm home for an old, lonely man like me."

    关心别人胜于关心自己
    山西闻喜县绛镇公社东吴村生产队的社员们，见人就夸奖他们的食堂女事务长崔桂兰。因为她全心全意为大家服务，食堂办得很出色，成为全县食堂战线上的女标兵，光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    崔桂兰初到食堂，不会记账，不会珠算……，在管理区党支部书记崔道礼的帮助下，她下决心学习。为了粗粮细作，她去别的食堂请教同行。食堂有二百多人吃饭，事务工作就够她干了，可是她把这些工作放在晚上搞，白天不是喂猪就是担水。农忙时，她和炊事员们格外卖力气，想办法使大家吃得满意。最近社员们都在急赶着拔棉花柴，她和炊事员千方百计为大家做下油炸菜丸子和炸豆腐等味美可口的饭菜，社员们吃得好干劲高，四百亩棉花柴不到十天就全部干净地拔完了。
    她态度和蔼，关心别人胜于关心自己。全食堂所有吃饭的人，谁爱吃咸，谁好吃淡，谁好吃软，她都知道得清清楚楚，并想尽办法满足各人的要求。谁没来吃饭，她也要打问清楚。种瓜的王四相老汉有一次生了病，崔桂兰一日三餐给他往家送饭，老汉感激地说：“公共食堂就是我这个孤苦老汉的温暖家庭。”
