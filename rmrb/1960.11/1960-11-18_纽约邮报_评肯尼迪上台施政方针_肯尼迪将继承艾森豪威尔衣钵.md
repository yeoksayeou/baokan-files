Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, New York Dispatch: The "New York Post" published a report on the 13th written by its Washington correspondent, Shannon, predicting the Kennedy administration's domestic and foreign policies for the next four years, with the "epitome" being Kennedy's policy guidelines for his first hundred days in office. The reporter admitted that Kennedy would inherit Eisenhower's mantle, vigorously promoting policies of preparing for nuclear war and enslaving the people of the world and the American people.

The reporter called Kennedy "a confident Cold War warrior." He believes that after this "Cold War warrior" takes office, he "will immediately increase military spending by three billion dollars or more to provide more missiles, more nuclear submarines, more Strategic Aerospace Command bombers in continuous airborne alert, and more army divisions." At the same time, "Kennedy intends to avoid any negotiations with Russia on (West) Berlin and other issues for as long as possible...until our (American) military strength recovers to what he considers an appropriate level."

The reporter acknowledged that although Kennedy would verbally express his efforts to "seek peace" and "try to reach a ban on nuclear testing," in reality he "believes in the content of the Rockefeller, Gaither, and other reports." These reports frantically advocated for a vigorous nuclear arms race and even advocated preparing to launch a nuclear war under the pretext of "repelling a Soviet atomic attack."

The reporter believes that Kennedy will also intensify infiltration into the surging national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America under the banner of "conducting political warfare against communism." To this end, he plans to reorganize the "foreign aid program" as a tool for American aggression.

On domestic policy, the reporter believes that at a time when the U.S. economy is currently "very weak," Kennedy will not increase taxes for the time being, but,
  "At some point in the next four years, Kennedy will almost certainly do what (New York) Governor Rockefeller did in New York State last year—a comprehensive and massive tax increase." The reporter wrote: "Kennedy's plans cost money, and taxpayers must pay for it."

    “纽约邮报”评肯尼迪上台施政方针
    肯尼迪将继承艾森豪威尔衣钵
    新华社17日讯　纽约消息：“纽约邮报”13日发表了该报驻华盛顿记者香农写的一篇报道，他以下届总统肯尼迪上台后头一百天的施政方针为“缩影”预测今后四年肯尼迪政府的国内外政策。记者承认，肯尼迪将继承艾森豪威尔的衣钵，大力推行准备核战争和奴役世界人民和美国人民的政策。
    这个记者把肯尼迪称为“一个有信心的冷战战士”。他认为，这个“冷战战士”上台之后，“将马上增加军事开支三十亿美元或三十亿美元以上，以提供更多的导弹，更多的核潜艇，更多的连续进行空中警戒的战略空军司令部的轰炸机，更多的陆军师”。同时，“肯尼迪打算尽可能长久地不同俄国进行关于（西）柏林问题和其他问题的一切谈判……一直到我们（美国）的军事实力恢复到他认为是适当的水平。”
    记者承认，虽然肯尼迪会在口头上表示要尽力“谋求和平”和“设法达成禁止核试验”，但是，实际上他“相信洛克菲勒、盖瑟以及其他报告的内容”。这些报告疯狂地鼓吹大力进行核军备竞赛，甚至主张借口“击退苏联原子进攻”而准备发动核战争。
    记者认为，肯尼迪还将在“对共产主义进行政治战”的旗帜下加紧渗入民族独立运动高涨的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。为此，他打算改组作为美国侵略工具的“援外计划”。
    在国内政策方面，记者认为，在目前美国经济“很疲软”的时候，肯尼迪暂时还不会增加赋税，但是，
  “在今后四年中的某些时候，肯尼迪几乎肯定会做（纽约）州长洛克菲勒去年在纽约州所做的事——全面大量增税”。记者写道：“肯尼迪的计划是花钱的，纳税人必须为此出钱。”
