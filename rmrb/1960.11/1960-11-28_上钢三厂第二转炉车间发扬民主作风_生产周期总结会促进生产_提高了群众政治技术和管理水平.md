Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th: In the struggle for a comprehensive and sustained leap forward in production this year, the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 has created a new form of work summary on the blast furnace: the production cycle summary meeting. They have transformed this summary format into a school for improving the political, technical, and management levels of the masses. Each summary meeting enables the workers to improve their thinking and skills, and the production level improves accordingly. Since the beginning of this year, the workshop's production has consistently been among the leaders of Shanghai's large converter workshops.

The production cycle summary promoted by the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 involves all three shifts of workers in the blast furnace gathering together when one production cycle of the blast furnace ends and the new furnace has not yet been built, inviting leading cadres and technical personnel to participate, discussing the experiences and lessons learned in the previous production cycle, and proposing the main focus and measures for the next cycle, without allowing problems to drag on to the next production cycle. Since May of this year, this workshop has never interrupted holding these production cycle summary meetings.

At the end of May, how to improve desulfurization efficiency in the furnace and reduce the sulfur content of molten iron was one of the important issues for the blast furnace at that time. The first cycle summary meeting held by Blast Furnace No. 1 focused on solving this problem. At that time, the sulfur content of this furnace was low during the C shift. Yu Falai, the C shift furnace leader, introduced at the meeting his experience of going beyond focusing only on the "three eyes" (wind eye, slag eye, iron tapping eye) in front of the furnace and going to the back of the furnace to focus on the "three materials," that is, grasping the composition and proportion of iron materials, slag materials, and batching before the materials enter the furnace, and doing the desulfurization work before it enters the furnace. Workers from other shifts also successively supplemented their experience in grasping the "three lines" (material line, large air volume route, hot air route). The meeting only lasted two or three hours, and the three shifts collectively summarized the scattered experience of the previous cycle into a complete set of operating experience of "three materials, three lines, and three eyes," which was adopted as a decision of all the furnace workers and implemented in the next cycle. As a result, in the next production cycle, the desulfurization efficiency of the entire furnace rapidly reached the advanced level of the entire plant, and the hourly molten iron melting rate also rapidly increased from about ten tons to more than sixteen tons. After the workshop's production was generally raised to a new level, contradictions emerged in each blast furnace between improving desulfurization efficiency and improving the melting rate: adding more lime reduced the sulfur content of the molten iron, but the amount of molten iron decreased; adding less lime increased the amount of molten iron, but the sulfur content was high. Everyone had already discussed this issue in the after-shift meetings, but how to solve it? This issue involved a wide range of aspects and was complex, and it was not easy to clarify the problem during the usual busy production. When the production cycle changed, people were not busy, their minds were relatively calm, and the problems were more obvious. At this time, the workers of Blast Furnace No. 1 exchanged the operating conditions of each shift at the production cycle summary meeting, reviewed the original records of the previous cycle, and discovered a pattern: when the temperature inside the furnace was high, both desulfurization efficiency and melting rate were high, which indicated that improving the desulfurization efficiency in the furnace did not necessarily rely solely on adding more lime. Once the problem was identified, everyone discussed the experience of how to increase the temperature, and summarized a set of experience centered on increasing the furnace temperature, including diligent ventilation, blocking air leaks, stabilizing the coke ratio, and "fine work with coarse grains." Later, they further enriched and improved these experiences through cycle summaries. As a result, the desulfurization efficiency and melting rate of this furnace both increased simultaneously, becoming a model for the city.

At the cycle summary meeting, due to the combination of the real and the virtual, and the carrying out of criticism and self-criticism, it has become an important place for carrying out mass political and ideological work. For example, after Blast Furnace No. 1 became a city-wide model, the melting rate remained at the level of 18 tons for several consecutive cycles. Some workers developed complacency, believing that it was not easy for others to catch up, and it would not be easy for them to go up again. Later, at a cycle summary meeting, everyone criticized this sentiment, and looked for shortcomings in the achievements and weak links in the advanced. The melting rate in the next production cycle quickly rose to 19.6 tons, and soon exceeded 20 tons. At the cycle summary meeting, because the masses opened their minds and spoke freely, it was also a good place for leaders to listen to the opinions of the masses. Leading cadres widely listen to the opinions of the masses, which can continuously improve their own style and further close the relationship between cadres and the masses.

The implementation of the cycle summary system has further fully promoted technical democracy. At each cycle summary meeting, the masses can fully express their opinions, put forward their own methods, and conduct democratic discussions on technical issues in production, thus fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses and strengthening the masses' sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs. When some reforms and measures are collectively decided after discussion at the meeting and approved by the leadership, each worker strictly implements them in production. Because this workshop timely supplemented many reforms and measures proposed by the masses at the cycle summary meeting into the operating procedures, reformed the old rules and regulations, and enabled the rules and regulations to continuously adapt to the needs of production development and mass movement development, it in turn promoted the development of production. For example, in order to prevent molten iron leaks, the operating procedures in the past stipulated that nine buckets of bottom coke should be added when opening a new furnace. Recently, some changes have been made to the use of raw materials when opening a new furnace. If the old regulations are still followed, it will affect iron tapping. Therefore, after discussion by the masses at the cycle summary meeting and approval by the workshop leaders, it was newly stipulated that seven buckets of bottom coke and a method of coke replenishment should be added to ensure smooth iron tapping in the newly opened furnace.

    上钢三厂第二转炉车间发扬民主作风 
    生产周期总结会促进生产
    提高了群众政治技术和管理水平
    新华社上海27日电　上海第三钢铁厂第二转炉车间在力争今年生产全面持续跃进中，在化铁炉上创造出一种总结工作的新形式：生产周期总结会。他们把这种总结形式变成了提高群众政治、技术、管理水平的学校，每一次总结都使职工的思想、本领提高一步，而生产水平也就相应地跟着提高。今年以来，这个车间的生产一直在上海各大型转炉车间中领先。
    上钢三厂第二转炉车间推行的生产周期总结，就是当化铁炉一个生产周期结束而新炉子还未砌好的时候，全炉三班工人齐聚一堂，请领导干部和技术人员参加，议论上一个周期生产中的经验和教训，提出下一个周期的主攻方向和措施，不让问题拖到下一个生产周期。从今年5月以来这个车间从来没有间断过举行这种生产周期总结会。
    5月底，如何提高炉内去硫效率、降低铁水含硫量，是当时化铁炉的重要问题之一。一号化铁炉举行的第一次周期总结会议，就集中研究解决这个问题。当时，这座炉子在生产中，一到丙班，含硫量就低。丙班炉长俞发来，在会上介绍了炉长跨出只在炉前抓“三眼”（风眼、渣眼、出铁眼）的范围，到炉后去抓“三料”的经验，即在料进炉以前就抓铁料、渣料、配料的成分和比例，把去硫工作做在入炉之前。其他班的工人也相继补充了如何抓“三线”（料线、大风量路线、热风路线）的经验。会议只开了二、三个钟头，三班就把上一周期零星分散的经验，集体总结出“三料、三线、三眼”的成套操作经验，作为全炉工人的决定，在下一个周期去贯彻。结果，下一个生产周期，全炉的去硫效率迅速达到了全厂先进水平，每小时的铁水熔化率也由原来的十吨左右，迅速提高到十六吨以上。车间生产普遍提到一个新的水平以后，各化铁炉又出现了提高去硫效率和提高熔化率之间的矛盾：多加了石灰，铁水的含硫量降低了，但铁水少了；少加了石灰，铁水多了，但含硫高了。平时班后会议上大家对这个问题已经议论纷纷，但到底如何解决？这个问题牵涉面广，错综复杂，平时生产紧张，问题一时不易弄清。到生产周期交替的时候，人们不忙了，头脑比较冷静了，问题暴露得也比较明显了。这时，一号化铁炉工人在生产周期总结会上，交流了各班操作情况，翻了上一周期的原始记录，发现了一个规律：炉内温度一高，去硫效率和熔化率都高，这说明提高炉内去硫效率并不一定光靠多加石灰。问题抓住了，接着大家就谈如何提高温度的体会，总结出了一套以提高炉温为中心的勤通风眼、堵塞漏风、稳定焦比、“粗粮细作”的经验。以后，他们又通过周期总结，把这些经验进一步加以充实和丰富。于是，这个炉子的去硫效率和熔化率双双同时上升，成为全市的标兵。
    在周期总结会上，由于有虚有实，开展批评自我批评，因而也就成了开展群众性政治思想工作的重要场所。如一号炉成为全市标兵以后，曾连续有几个周期的熔化率停留在十八吨水平上，部分工人中出现了自满情绪，认为人家赶上来不容易，自己再上去也不容易。后来在一次周期总结会上，大家就批判了这种情绪，并从成绩中间找缺点，从先进中间找薄弱环节。下一生产周期的熔化率就很快上升到十九点六吨，不久又超过了二十吨。在周期总结会上，由于群众敞开思想，畅所欲言，因此也是领导倾听群众意见的好地方。领导干部广泛听取群众的意见，就可以不断改进自己的作风，进一步密切干群的关系。
    推行周期总结制度，进一步充分发扬了技术民主。在每次周期总结会上，群众可以充分发表自己的意见，提出自己的办法，对生产技术上的问题展开民主议论，因此，充分调动了群众的积极性，加强了群众当家作主的责任感。当一些改革和措施经过会议讨论集体作出决定并经领导批准以后，每个工人在生产中都严格执行。这个车间由于把群众在周期总结会上提出的很多改革和措施，及时地充实到操作规程中去，改革旧的规章制度，使规章制度能不断地适应生产发展和群众运动发展的需要，反过来又促进生产的发展。例如，为了防止漏铁水，过去操作规程规定开新炉子要加九斗底焦，最近，在开新炉子时，对原材料的使用，作了一些改变，如果仍照老规定操作，就要影响出铁，因此，经过群众在周期总结会上讨论，并经过车间领导干部批准，就重新规定了加七斗底焦和补焦的办法，使新开的炉子顺利出铁。
