Strengthen Ideological Education, Arrange Work According to Individual Abilities
Downward Transferred Personnel Can Give Full Play to Their Talents
Victory Third Team's Returning Commune Members Vow to Contribute to Large-Scale Agriculture, The Team's Production is Flourishing

    (Our report) Wuhan – The Third Production Team of the Victory Management District, Luoyang Commune, Suixian County, Hubei Province, has fully utilized the role of downward transferred labor, promoting the smooth progress of autumn and winter production.

    Around the time the Party Central Committee issued instructions on developing agriculture and grain production on a large scale, a total of thirteen able-bodied workers and ten young students returned to the front line of agricultural production in this production team. With the exception of the young students, the vast majority of these workers had been transferred to the county, commune, and management district in 1958 to engage in other production. This time, they actively responded to the Party's call and returned to their original production units to participate in agricultural production.

    Political and Economic Work Go Hand in Hand
    In order to fully utilize the role of downward transferred labor, the Party branch of this production team promptly analyzed the new situation after the labor transfer and understood the ideological problems of the downward transferred personnel. It then convened a forum for the downward transferred personnel to educate them to settle down and engage in production, and to listen to their opinions. After the meeting, the Party branch decided: on the one hand, to widely and deeply educate the masses on the Party's policy of downward transferring personnel to strengthen the agricultural front line; on the other hand, to require team cadres to be responsible for dividing the work and to conduct home visits and individual talks with the downward transferred labor, to understand their ideological situation and specific difficulties in a detailed and specific manner. Through such universal visits, the Party branch found that the following problems still existed among the downward transferred personnel, which were resolved after discussion by the masses:

      (1) Arranging jobs reasonably according to individual abilities. For example, among the downward transferred personnel were bamboo weavers, carpenters, stonemasons, bricklayers, paper mill workers, etc. When they first arrived, they could not give full play to their technical specialties because the teams could not arrange jobs according to their individual abilities. According to their opinions, the production team helped the team specifically arrange for the bamboo weaver Li Dahong to weave baskets for the use of commune members in repairing water conservancy and carrying pond mud; arranged for the carpenter Ye Quanfu to specifically saw boards and do carpentry work; and arranged for bricklayers and stonemasons to build cattle pens and toilets. Of course, in cases where agricultural work is very tight, every worker must be involved in agricultural production.

      (2) Wage remuneration issues. Before the issue of arranging jobs according to individual abilities was resolved, bamboo weavers, carpenters, stonemasons, bricklayers, paper mill workers, etc., were paid the same as general agricultural labor for the same work; but when they were doing their respective trades outside, their wages were slightly higher than those in agriculture. While arranging jobs according to individual abilities, the production team formulated reasonable wage remuneration through democratic discussion among commune members. Based on the principle that technical work should be paid slightly higher than agricultural work, a method of contracting for work, output, and income was adopted. For example, for the bamboo weaver Li Dahong, the first regulation was that he would be credited with ten work points for handing over three baskets to the team every day, and his wages would be distributed at the end of the month according to his work points, the same as other commune members. As a result, Li Dahong happily said: "The production team takes such good care of me, I must make the baskets even better to ensure that the commune members have them whenever they need them."

      (3) Issues related to production and living difficulties. Among the laborers sent down by this team, four were single men. After they were transferred from this team, their private plots were either managed by the team or by other commune members. After returning to the team this time, none of them had vegetable gardens, some of them lacked cotton quilts and clothing for the winter, and some of them lacked small farm tools. The living problems of families with large mouths and low incomes also needed to be solved. The Party branch first allocated more than one fen of private land to Jin Gaoshui, Ye Quanyin, and others who did not have vegetable gardens. At the same time, the production team also lent them seeds and helped them solve the fertilizer problem, planting vegetables and broad beans. The canteen also distributed some vegetables to them first to solve the immediate problem of eating vegetables. In terms of cold protection for the winter, it also helped solve the difficulties of those who lacked clothing and bedding. For commune members who lacked production tools, the team mobilized commune members to help each other on a voluntary basis, and also specifically arranged time for them to engage in household sideline production to increase their income for self-purchase.

      (4) Learning production technology. Most of the downward transferred laborers in this team were farmers, and only a small number were relatively unfamiliar with agricultural technology. According to the situation of each individual, the Party branch adopted methods such as master teaching apprentice, contracting for teaching and learning, cadres setting examples, and commune members following suit to solve this problem. In the process of contracting for teaching and learning, the principles of easy before difficult, rough before fine, and light before heavy were also grasped. For example, the second team had more young students returning to the countryside. During the autumn planting season, in order to teach the 19-year-old Zhang Xinan and the 20-year-old Zhang Kaiding the technique of ditching, the team leader Lü Dingguo personally made a ditching model for them. With Lü Dingguo's patient help, the ditches he two young men dug in the four-and-a-half-mu barley field in Xiaohouziwa won unanimous praise from the commune members.

              Everyone is in a Good Mood
    After the above series of political and organizational work, the downward transferred personnel became more determined to engage in agricultural production. In the past two or three months, most of them have earned six or seven hundred work points, and their income is generally no lower than before the downward transfer. For example, Lu Jiawang, a strong laborer who returned from the commune's iron smelting plant, earned 347 points in October. His total net income from wages and sideline production during holidays was 21% higher than his net income from wages before the downward transfer. Wang Weizhen, whose family was large and whose labor force was weak (five people in the family ate, only he himself labored), under the reasonable arrangement and appropriate care of the production team, had a net income from wages and personal sideline production in October that was also more than 12% higher than before the downward transfer. Therefore, they all said that they must contribute their strength to developing agriculture and grain production on a large scale with practical actions. After two or three months of personal experience, the cadres and commune members have also further clarified the benefits of labor transfer. Because this production team has done a good job in the work of downward transferred labor and given full play to the production enthusiasm of the returning labor and the original home labor, various productions since the beginning of autumn have been in a proactive position. This year's actual sowing area in autumn was 35.5% larger than last year's, and wheat sowing began four days after the Cold Dew and ended six days before the Frost's Descent. After the autumn sowing was completed, it was fully transferred to winter production. Small autumn harvest, canteen vegetable planting, sideline production and other work have also been launched.

    加强思想教育  因人制宜排工
    下放人员各尽其能各得其所
    胜利三队归队社员誓为大办农业立功，全队生产蒸蒸日上
    本报讯　湖北随县洛阳公社胜利管理区第三生产队，充分发挥下放劳动力的作用，促进了秋、冬季生产的顺利开展。
    在党中央关于大办农业、大办粮食的指示下达前后，这个生产队共有十三个整劳动力和十名青年学生，回到了农业生产第一线。除青年学生外，这些劳动力绝大多数都是在1958年被调到县、公社、管理区去从事其他生产的。这次，他们积极响应党的号召，回到原生产单位参加农业生产。
    政治、经济工作双管齐下
    为了充分发挥下放劳动力的作用，这个生产队的党支部及时分析了劳力下放后的新情况，了解了下放人员的思想问题，接着召开了下放人员座谈会，教育他们安心生产，并倾听他们的意见。会后，党支部决定：一面在群众中广泛深入地进行党的下放人员加强农业第一线的政策教育；一面要求队干部分工负责，对下放劳力进行家庭访问和个别谈心，深入具体地了解他们的思想情况和具体困难。通过这样普遍访问，党支部发现在下放人员中，还存在着下列几个问题，经群众讨论后，分别得到了解决：
      （一）因人制宜，合理安排活路问题。如下放归队的人员中有篾匠、木匠、石匠、泥瓦匠、造纸厂工人等，他们初来时因各小队没能因人制宜安排活路，不能发挥他们的技术特长。生产队根据他们的意见，帮助小队专门安排了篾匠李大洪编织箢子，以供当前社员们修水利、挑塘泥之用；安排了木匠叶全富专门锯板子、做木工；安排了泥瓦匠、石匠修建牛栏、厕所。当然，在农活非常紧张的情况下，每个劳力都一律要投入农业生产。
      （二）工资报酬问题。在因人制宜安排活路的问题没解决以前，篾匠、木匠、石匠、泥瓦匠、造纸厂工人等，都和一般农业劳力同工同酬；但他们在外搞本行，工资都略高于农业。生产队在因人制宜安排活路的同时，便通过社员民主讨论，制订了合理的工资报酬。他们根据技术活略高于农业报酬的原则，采取了包工包产包收入的办法。如对篾匠李大洪，第一次规定是每天交小队三个箢子记十分，月终和其他社员一样按工分发工资。这样一来，李大洪高兴的说：“生产队对我这样照顾，我一定要把箢子做的更好，保证社员们几时要，几时有。”
      （三）有关生产和生活困难问题。这个队下放的劳动力，有四个是单身汉，他们从本队被调走后，自留地或由小队经管或由其他社员经管了。这次回队后都没有菜园，有的人还缺少过冬的棉被、棉衣，还有的人缺少小农具，家大口阔、入不敷出户的生活问题也需要解决。党支部首先给没有菜园的金高水、叶全银等，每人拨了一分多自留地，同时，生产队还借给他们种子，帮助解决肥料，种上了蔬菜和蚕豆。食堂还先分给他们一部分菜，解决眼前的吃菜问题。在防寒过冬方面，也帮助解决了他们中个别缺衣缺被的困难。对缺少生产工具的社员，一面发动社员在自愿的原则下互助互借，一面专门安排时间给他们搞家庭副业，增加收入自己购买。
      （四）学习生产技术问题。这个队的下放劳力，大部分都是农民，只有小部分人对农业技术比较生疏。党支部根据各人的情况，采取师傅带徒弟、包教包学、干部前面作样版、社员后面照着干等办法，解决了这个问题。在包教包学的过程中，还掌握了先易后难、先粗后细、先轻后重的原则。如第二小队回乡的青年学生较多，在秋种时，为了教会十九岁的张新安和二十岁的张开定掌握整沟的技术，小队长吕定国便亲自给他们作了整沟样版，在吕定国耐心帮助下，他俩在小猴子洼四亩四分大麦田里整的沟，博得了社员们一致称赞。
              人人心情舒畅
    经过上述一系列的政治工作和组织工作以后，下放的人员更坚定了从事农业生产的信心，两、三个月以来，他们大多数都做了六、七百工分，收入一般不低于下放以前。如由公社炼铁厂回来的强劳动力鲁家旺，10月份做了三百四十七分，工资和个人在假日搞的副业，合计纯收入比下放前的工资纯收入还高21％。家大口阔劳力又较弱的王维振（全家五人吃饭，只本人劳动），在生产小队的合理安排和适当照顾下，10月份工资和个人副业纯收入，比下放前也高12％以上。因此，他们都表示：一定要以实际行动，为大办农业、大办粮食贡献自己的力量。干部和社员经过两三个月的亲身体会后，也进一步明确了劳力下放的好处。因为这个生产队对下放劳力的工作作的好，充分发挥了归队劳力和原在家劳力的生产积极性，使入秋以来的各项生产，一直处于主动的地位。今年秋种实播面积比去年扩大了35.5％，寒露后四天开始种麦，到霜降前六天就结束了。秋种结束后，即全面转入了冬季生产。小秋收、食堂种菜、副业生产等活路，也都开展起来了。
