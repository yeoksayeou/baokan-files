Visiting the Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative
Zhang Kunying

One day in early November, the "Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative" in the suburbs of Hanoi was filled with joy. The members, celebrating the bumper harvest of late rice, excitedly welcomed He Wei, the Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam, and the staff of the embassy he led, for a friendly visit.

At around 8 o'clock, when Ambassador He Wei's car arrived at the village entrance, the welcoming crowd had already filled both sides of the road. There were young and strong lads, gray-haired old men, and innocent and lively children. Everyone's face was filled with joyful emotions, and they all used welcoming and friendly words to greet the Chinese friends. After the guests got out of the car, they shook hands with the welcoming people one by one. At this moment, greetings, laughter, and applause intertwined into a joyful song. The sincere friendship between China and Vietnam moved people's hearts.

At this happy and friendly moment, people couldn't help but recall the scene of the naming ceremony of the Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative. The Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative is located on the banks of the Red River, only seven kilometers away from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This cooperative was transformed into a higher-level cooperative after merging three primary cooperatives in May this year, and it is also an advanced cooperative that established a higher-level agricultural cooperative the earliest in the suburbs of Hanoi. Currently, it has 220 households, 1,001 farmers, and 82 hectares of cultivated land, in addition to 6 hectares of fish ponds.

This cooperative was named "Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative" during our National Day this year. On that day, Tran Duy Hung, Chairman of the Hanoi City Administrative Committee, said at the naming ceremony: In order to celebrate the great victory of the fraternal Chinese people in completing the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, and to mark the development of the everlasting friendship between the people of China and Vietnam, the Hanoi City Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Hanoi City Administrative Committee decided to name the First Advanced Agricultural Cooperative of Tran Phu Commune as "Vietnam-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative". People are confident that the naming of this cooperative will further strengthen the friendly ties and exchange of experiences between the people of China and Vietnam.

Today, the rice fields at the entrance of Tran Phu Village were golden, and the ears of rice laden with grains hanging down in the fields looked particularly dazzling, as if they were also welcoming the Chinese guests. The cooperative members who were busy harvesting in the fields were all beaming with joy. The guests went to the fields, extending cordial greetings to the busy members, and picked up sickles to harvest together with the members. Ambassador He Wei's cordial attitude and skilled sickle movements aroused the admiration of the members. For a while, the fields were filled with an atmosphere of infinite joy and friendship. Although the labor time was so short, the harvesting progressed quickly, and in a short while, a large area of golden rice fell down row by row under the sickles of the people. At this time, the members, with excitement and emotion, took a large bundle of golden rice and presented it to Ambassador He Wei. Thunderous applause and laughter resounded once again in the fields.

The hosts cordially led the guests to visit the fish ponds. The members of the fish farming team were fishing in the ponds. The active fish were tumbling in the net, and the silver scales were glittering. The Chinese guests praised the abundant harvest.

When we asked about the fish farming situation, the young commune Party secretary replied enthusiastically: "This year, we raised 2 million fish fry and 60,000 market fish. The fish fry were caught by the members from the sea in May this year. Now, after only five months, the fish have grown to four or five inches."

He continued: "The income from fish is quite considerable. It is estimated that the income from May to the end of this year will reach about 20,000 Vietnamese Dong. As for feed, in addition to various leaves, there is also yellow cattle manure. The small fish grow quickly and fat after eating cow dung."

We then visited the kindergarten, the midwifery station, and the second-level general school (junior high school). In the kindergarten, the innocent children were in class. When they saw so many Chinese guests arrive, they stared with curious eyes and politely shouted to the Chinese guests: "Hello, uncles! Hello, aunties!" Then the children sang several songs to welcome the guests. Listening to the children's innocent and lively songs, one could not help but feel how happy the children of the peasants live in socialist countries, and how they are educated in collectivism and internationalism from an early age.

During the break, the young commune Party secretary cordially introduced the situation of the agricultural cooperative to the guests.

He said: "The land here is very fertile, and the irrigation conditions are also good. However, in the past, under the rule of French colonialists, the yield was very low, with an average maximum yield of only 2,000 kilograms per hectare. But after the restoration of peace, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, we embarked on the road of collectivization, and the situation has completely changed. The yield has increased year by year. In 1958, the average yield per hectare was 2,835 kilograms, and in 1959 it increased to 3,202 kilograms. Although the harvest has not been completed this year, from the current situation, there is no doubt that the yield will increase."

This year, the cooperative established two poultry experimental farms, raising 15,000 chickens and ducks. The commune Party secretary said that in addition to further expanding and increasing the production of rice, vegetables, and livestock, they are also studying the possibility of building a brick and tile factory. In addition, illiteracy has long been eliminated throughout the commune. For this, the government awarded the Labor Medal in 1958.

The commune Party secretary told us about the income of the cooperative members: "If all kinds of income are converted into rice, the average income per person per year is 400 kilograms."

Ambassador He praised their economic and cultural development, and said: "The China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune in Shahe, Beijing, has 40,000 people, but still feels the labor force is insufficient. The staff of the Vietnamese Embassy in China also participated in labor. When you need labor, you can transfer people from our embassy. We are all your members." Everyone in the room laughed. It was truly like a family, filled with close and friendly feelings.

As the visit was about to end, the commune Party secretary asked the Chinese guests to convey their greetings to the members of the China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune in Shahe, Beijing.

The guests said that they would definitely bring their deep friendship to the members of the China-Vietnam Friendship People's Commune in Shahe, and also expressed the hope that this cooperative would achieve greater success and that the two cooperatives would launch a friendly competition.

    在越中友好农业社作客
    张坤英
    11月初的一天，河内市郊“越中友好农业社”洋溢着一片欢乐气氛，社员们在喜庆晚稻丰收的时候，兴高采烈地迎接了我国驻越南大使何伟和他率领的使馆工作人员前来进行友好的参观访问。
    八时许，当何伟大使的汽车到达村头时，欢迎的人群早已站满道路两旁。这里有年青力壮的小伙子，有白发苍苍的老人，还有天真活泼的孩子们，每个人的脸上都充满着喜悦的感情，都用欢迎、友谊的美好词句欢迎着中国朋友。客人们走下汽车后，和欢迎的人们一一握手。这时，问候声、欢笑声和掌声交织成一曲欢乐的歌曲。中越友谊的挚情激动着人们的心弦。
    在这愉快、友好的时刻，人们不禁想起越中友好农业社命名典礼的情景。越中友好农业社位于红河之滨，距离越南民主共和国首都——河内市只有七公里。这个合作社是今年5月由三个初级社合并后转入高级社的，也是河内市郊区最早成立高级农业社的先进社。目前有二百二十户，农民一千零一人，耕地八十二公顷，此外，还有六公顷渔塘。
    今年我国国庆的时候，这个社被命名为“越中友好农业社”。那一天，河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴同志在命名仪式上说：为庆祝兄弟的中国人民提前三年完成第二个五年计划的伟大胜利，为了标志越中两国人民之间万古长青的友好关系的发展，越南劳动党河内市委员会和河内市行政委员会决定陈富乡第一高级农业社命名为“越中友好农业社”。人们确信，这个社的命名，将使中越两国人民之间的友谊联系和经验交流得到进一步的加强。
    今天，陈富乡村头的稻田里一片金黄，弯垂在田里的颗粒累累的稻子显得分外耀眼，它们也好像在向中国客人表示欢迎。正在田里忙着收割的社员们个个喜气洋洋。客人们走到田里，一边向忙碌的社员们致以亲切的问候，一边拿起镰刀同社员们一起收割。何伟大使的亲切态度和熟练的挥镰动作，引起了社员们的钦佩。一时田里弥漫着无限愉快、友谊的气氛。尽管劳动的时间是如此短促，但是由于收割的速度进行得迅速，不大一会工夫，一大片金黄的稻子就在人们的镰刀下一排排地倒了下来。这时，社员们怀着兴奋和激动的心情，拿过一大捆金色稻子赠送给何伟大使。田野里再一次响起了春雷般的掌声和欢笑声。
    主人殷勤地带领着客人前往参观渔塘。养鱼小组的组员们正在塘里捕鱼，活跃的小鱼在网里翻腾，银色的鱼鳞闪闪发光，中国客人对这丰产的景象啧啧称赞。
    当我们问到养鱼的情况时，年青的乡支书充满热情地回答：“今年养了二百万尾鱼秧，还有六万尾肉鱼，鱼秧是社员们在今年5月从海里捞来的。现在仅仅经过五个月的时间，可是鱼儿已经长了四、五寸了。”
    他接着说：“鱼的收入相当可观，预计从今年5月到今年年底收入可达二万越元左右。至于饲料，除了各种树叶之外，还有黄牛粪，小鱼吃了牛粪长得又快又肥。”
    我们随后还参观了幼儿园、助产院和第二级普通学校（初中学校）。在幼儿园里，天真的小朋友们正在上课，当他们看到那么多中国客人到来时，瞪着一双双好奇的小眼睛，望着中国客人有礼貌地喊着：伯伯好、阿姨好。接着孩子们唱了几支歌曲表示对客人的欢迎。听了孩子们的天真活泼的歌声，不能不使人感到，在社会主义国家里，农民的子弟过着多么幸福的童年生活，他们从小就受着集体主义和国际主义的教育。
    休息的时候，年青的乡支部书记亲切地向客人介绍了农业社的情况。
    他说：“我们这里的土地非常肥沃，灌溉条件也好，但是，过去在法殖民主义者统治下产量很低，平均每公顷最高产量仅二千公斤。但是和平恢复后，在劳动党的领导下，我们走上了合作化的道路，情况就完全改观了，产量年年增加。1958年平均每公顷产量二千八百三十五公斤，1959年增加到三千二百零二公斤，今年虽然还没有收割完，但是，从目前的情况看，增产是毫无疑问的。”
    今年社里办了两个家禽试验场，养了一万五千只鸡鸭。乡支书说，除了在稻谷、蔬菜和饲养方面将进一步扩大和增多之外，现在还正研究办个砖瓦厂。此外，全乡早已扫除了文盲，为此，1958年得到了政府奖给的劳动勋章。
    乡支书告诉我们社员收入的情况：“如果各种收入折合稻子的话，每人每年的收入平均四百公斤。”
    何大使称赞他们在经济上、文化上的发展，并且说：“北京沙河中越友好人民公社有四万人，但是仍然感到劳动力不足，越南驻中国使馆的工作人员还去参加了劳动。你们这里需要劳动力时，可以从我们使馆调人，我们都是你们的社员。”全房间的人都大笑起来。真是亲如一家，充满了亲密友好的感情。
    在访问将要结束的时候，乡支部书记请中国客人转达对北京沙河中越友好人民公社社员们的问候。
    客人表示一定把他们的深情厚谊带给沙河中越友好人民公社的社员们，同时也表示希望这个社取得更大的成就，两社展开友好竞赛。（附图片）
