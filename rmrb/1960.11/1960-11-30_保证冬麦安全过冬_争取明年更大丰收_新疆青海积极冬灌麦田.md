Xinhua News Agency report:

    To ensure winter wheat safely overwinters and strive for a greater harvest next year, a high tide of winter irrigation of wheat fields has been universally launched in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Although the water volume this year is greatly reduced compared with the same period last year, the progress of winter irrigation is still faster than last year. As of mid-November, the winter irrigation area in the region has exceeded ten million mu. In order to ensure the safe overwintering of winter wheat and strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year, various places are continuing to carry out crash irrigation. At present, many places in southern Xinjiang have completed irrigation. In northern Xinjiang, where the ground freezes earlier, they are still actively breaking the ice to divert water and strive to expand the area of winter irrigation.
    This year, the winter wheat planting area in Xinjiang has expanded by more than 40% compared with last year, but the amount of water available in various places is 20% to 40% less than the same period last year. In order to overcome this contradiction, various places have paid attention to arranging winter irrigation as early as possible and strengthened leadership over this work. Kashgar, Hotan, Aksu and other southern Xinjiang regions organized manpower to invest in the preparation of winter irrigation as early as before and after the autumn harvest, and winter irrigation has been fully launched in mid-to-late October. Leaders at all levels in the Aksu region went deep into the front line as early as possible to help various communes check water sources, soil moisture, and irrigation water volume, and arranged irrigation work according to different situations. During winter irrigation, various places paid special attention to water-saving technical measures and irrigation management, and widely adopted small-plot irrigation, trickle irrigation, centralized rotational irrigation, combined canal diversion, and appropriate irrigation measures to try every means to increase income and reduce expenditure, and improve irrigation efficiency and quality.
    Xinhua News Agency report: Qinghai is stepping up winter irrigation. Most of the fields in the province planned for spring wheat winter sowing have now been irrigated once.
    There is little rain in Qinghai Province in spring, and droughts are prone to occur, sometimes even affecting the timely sowing and smooth emergence of spring-sown crops. In order to make full use of winter water sources and prevent spring drought, all localities attach great importance to winter irrigation. There was more rainfall in Qinghai this autumn, and the winter irrigation water source is abundant. Before the start of winter irrigation, people's communes in various places generally repaired the canals, leveled the land in conjunction with plowing the autumn stubble, raised the ridges, and added branch canals. At the same time, they planned water sources, and each production team and small team arranged the order and water demand for irrigation of various types of fields, and vigorously publicized the benefits of small-plot irrigation to ensure that reasonable and water-saving irrigation is achieved in winter irrigation, so that all types of cultivated land can be evenly, thoroughly, and timely irrigated.
    In order to complete the irrigation before the ground freezes, many people's communes have implemented the method of rotating personnel in shifts, with irrigation continuing day and night.

    保证冬麦安全过冬　争取明年更大丰收
    新疆青海积极冬灌麦田
    据新华社讯　新疆维吾尔自治区普遍掀起麦田冬灌高潮。尽管今年水量比去年同期大为减少，冬灌进度仍比去年快。至11月中旬，全区冬灌面积已超过一千万亩。各地为保证冬麦安全过冬争取明年小麦丰收，正继续突击抢灌。目前南疆不少地方已经灌完，北疆封冻早的地区，仍在积极破冰引水，尽力扩大冬灌面积。
    今年新疆冬麦播种面积比去年扩大了40％以上，但各地拥有的水量比去年同期少20％到40％。为了克服这一矛盾，各地注意了及早安排冬灌，并加强对这一工作的领导。喀什、和田、阿克苏等南疆地区早在秋收前后即组织人力投入了冬灌的准备，10月中、下旬已全面展开冬灌。阿克苏专区各级领导及早深入第一线，帮助各公社查水源、墒情、灌水量，根据不同情况安排浇灌工作。各地在冬灌中，对浇水技术措施和灌溉管理抓得特别紧，广泛采用小畦灌溉、细流灌溉、集中轮灌、合渠改道、适量灌溉等措施，千方百计开源节流，提高浇水效率和质量。
    据新华社讯　青海各地抓紧冬灌。全省计划春麦冬播的田，现在大部分都灌过了一次水。
    青海省春季雨水较少，容易发生旱象，有时甚至影响春播作物的适时播种和顺利出苗。为了充分利用冬季水源，预防春旱，各地都十分重视冬灌工作。今年秋季青海雨量较多，冬灌的水源丰富。各地人民公社在开始冬灌前，普遍修整了渠道，结合翻耕秋茬平整了土地，加高了楞坎，添修了毛渠；同时，规划了水源，每个生产队、小队对各类田地都安排了灌水次序和需水量，并且大力宣传了小畦灌溉的好处，以保证在冬灌中做到合理用水和节约用水，使各类耕地都能灌匀、灌透、灌得及时。
    为了抢在地冻以前灌完，许多人民公社实行了人员分班倒换，浇水昼夜不停的办法。
