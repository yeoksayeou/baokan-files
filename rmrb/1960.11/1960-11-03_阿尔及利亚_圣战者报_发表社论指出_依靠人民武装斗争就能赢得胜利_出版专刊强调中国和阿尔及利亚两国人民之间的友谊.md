Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, November 1st: The Algerian National Liberation Front's newspaper "El Moudjahid" published an editorial today commemorating the sixth anniversary of the Algerian people's armed struggle.

    The newspaper also published a commemorative special issue. Under the title "China-Algeria Friendship," the special issue carried thirteen photos of Prime Minister Abbas's visit to China. The special issue also carried Prime Minister Abbas's talk to the newspaper's reporters after returning from his visits to China and the Soviet Union.

    The editorial published by "El Moudjahid" said: "Complete victory is already in our hands, and the road to victory is the road formulated on November 1, 1954, namely: 'United action; armed struggle takes priority.'" The editorial said: "Today, our revolution enters its seventh year, which is not only a major event in the history of Algeria, but also in the history of the African continent, and in the history of the struggle of all peoples against imperialist rule and exploitation." The editorial went on to say, "Our revolution has destroyed the foundations of the French colonial empire and accelerated the historical process of the struggle for liberation by the ruled peoples. It has illuminated the path of the oppressed peoples, torn apart the masks of the colonialist allies worldwide, and exposed the truth of the colonialists' conspiracies hidden behind the so-called democratic principles and the so-called defense of the 'free world,' etc." The editorial added, "Our people have been able to accomplish this mission because they rely on themselves, because they have unwavering confidence in their cause, because they have a thorough understanding of the enemy, and finally because they can unite their ranks around the National Liberation Front and the National Liberation Army and continue the struggle unswervingly." The editorial emphasized, "The struggle is not over" and the road is still long and arduous. "The most reliable way to benefit from these victories is precisely not to be complacent."

    "El Moudjahid" also published an article entitled "In the Six Years of War" in the special issue. The article said that the sympathy initially aroused by the heroism of the Algerian people has now formed a genuine movement of solidarity. Throughout the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, this solidarity is concretely manifested in the increasing assistance to the Algerian revolution in all aspects. France is becoming increasingly isolated internationally.

    阿尔及利亚“圣战者报”发表社论指出
    依靠人民武装斗争就能赢得胜利
    出版专刊强调中国和阿尔及利亚两国人民之间的友谊
    据新华社突尼斯1日电　阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关报“圣战者报”今天发表社论，纪念阿尔及利亚人民武装斗争六周年。
    这家报纸还出版了纪念专刊，专刊在“中国—阿尔及利亚友谊”的标题下刊载了阿巴斯总理在中国进行访问的十三幅图片。专刊也刊载了阿巴斯总理在访问中国和苏联归来后向这家报纸记者发表的谈话。
    “圣战者报”发表的社论说：“完全的胜利已经掌握在我们手中，通往胜利的道路就是1954年11月1日所制定的道路，即：‘一致行动；武装斗争占优先地位。’”社论说：“今天，我们的革命进入第七年，这不仅在阿尔及利亚的历史上是件大事，而且在非洲大陆的历史上，以及在各国人民反对帝国主义统治和剥削的斗争史上，都是一件大事。”社论接着说，“我们的革命摧毁了法国殖民帝国的基础，加速了被统治的各国人民争取解放的历史进程。它照亮了被压迫的各国人民的道路，在世界范围内撕破了殖民主义的盟国的假面具，揭露了隐藏在所谓民主原则和所谓保卫‘自由世界’等等幌子后面的殖民主义者的阴谋的真相。”社论又说，“我国人民之所以能完成这个使命，是因为依靠自己，因为对自己的事业有着不可动摇的信心，因为透彻地了解敌人，最后因为能把自己的队伍团结在民族解放阵线和民族解放军的周围，坚持不渝地继续进行斗争。”社论强调指出，“斗争还没有结束”道路还是漫长的和艰巨的。从这些胜利中得益的最可靠的办法恰恰就是不能自满。”
    “圣战者报”在专刊上还发表了“在战争的六年中”的文章。文章说，当初是阿尔及利亚人民的英雄主义所激起的同情，现在形成了一个真正的声援运动。在全世界，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，这种声援具体表现为在各方面对阿尔及利亚革命日增的援助。法国在国际上愈来愈陷于孤立。
