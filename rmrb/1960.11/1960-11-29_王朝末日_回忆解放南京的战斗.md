    The End of a Dynasty
    ——Remembering the Battle to Liberate Nanjing
    He Kexi
    Preparing to strike directly at the enemy's lair

    After the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin three major campaigns, the main force of the Kuomintang reactionary army had been eliminated. The puppet Chiang Kai-shek government, a tool of American imperialism's colonial rule in China, was sinking like a broken ship in the currents of history. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution was a foregone conclusion, and the main task facing the Chinese people was to quickly cross the Yangtze River and liberate all of China!

    At this time, the Kuomintang reactionary government, in order to preserve its remaining strength and the American imperialist forces of aggression in China, attempted to gain a breathing space and issued a statement seeking peace for war criminals. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao thoroughly exposed the enemy's conspiracy to win time and then stage a comeback to extinguish the revolution's false peace, and put forward eight conditions as the principles of a peace agreement.

    We deeply understood that no matter the outcome of the negotiations, the People's Liberation Army would cross the Yangtze River and advance south to the entire country, and the revolution must be carried through to the end. Therefore, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, in April, our million-strong army actively prepared to break through the Kuomintang's so-called "thousand-mile Yangtze River defense line" across the board and liberate all of China.

    After winning the great victory in the Huaihai Campaign, our Second and Third Field Armies marched south, directly towards the Yangtze River. The Front Committee decided to use the force of three armies to prepare to cross the river east and west of Nanjing and advance deep into the enemy's territory. Our army was given the glorious task of capturing Pukou from the front and seizing Nanjing as opportunity presented itself.

    When I returned from headquarters after receiving the assignment, fraternal units had already begun to move to both sides. In order to strengthen the leadership of our army, He Yixiang, the Chief of Staff of the Corps, came despite his illness to conduct an on-site survey with us.

    The Pukou and Puzhen areas are undulating hills, and the hilltops are covered with winding communication trenches and bunker groups like tombs. The highway from Puzhen to Pukou meanders through the hills, and the wide road surface is covered with piles of stones and defensive ditches. The switchbacks are also built with various bunkers. Puzhen, Pukou, and Jiangpu form a solid line of defense, mutually reinforcing each other. This proves that the enemy has no intention of laying down their weapons, but only vainly hopes to use this advantageous terrain to hinder our army's advance and ensure the safety of their lair - Nanjing.

    After looking at the terrain, we realized even more the brilliance of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to use revolutionary means to deal with counter-revolutionary means. We immediately called together the commanders of each division to jointly study the combat deployment. Chief of Staff He said:

    "Commissar He, what do you think is the best way to fight?"

    I said: "We must not get entangled with the enemy in Jiangbei. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, quickly concentrate our superior forces, first seek to annihilate the enemy, and then cross the river and head straight for Nanjing. This requires first taking Jiangpu on the right flank, then capturing Puzhen from the front, then taking Pukou, and striving to cross the river first."

    After everyone spoke, Chief of Staff He nodded and said, "Let's decide it that way!"

    Not Allowing the Enemy to Put Up a Last-Ditch Resistance

    On April 20, the Nanjing Kuomintang government finally chose the path of self-destruction from the people and rejected the final revised draft of the "Domestic Peace Agreement". That night, we received the order from Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: advance bravely, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all Kuomintang reactionaries in China who dare to resist, liberate all the people of the country, and defend the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. Because we were fully prepared, our army began the attack at zero hour on the 21st. The troops fought very fiercely. Although the enemy was still organizing its forces to resist stubbornly, we received good news from two divisions in just a few hours: one division occupied Jiangpu County, annihilating the enemy and capturing a large number of prisoners; and one division cleared the advance positions of Puzhen, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. At the same time, we also received a notice from the corps: since last night, our 300,000-strong army had first broken through the Wuhu-Anqing line in the central sector and crossed the river.

    The development of the situation clearly told us that our million-strong army was breaking through the enemy's boasted "thousand-mile Yangtze River defense line" with the force of an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, on a front of more than 500 kilometers, from Hukou northeast of Jiujiang in the west to Jiangyin in the east. I put down the telegram and immediately notified each division by telephone to push hard into Puzhen and Pukou and strive to cross the Yangtze River and liberate Nanjing as quickly as possible.

    During the day on the 21st, our army actively attacked the left flank with a portion of its forces, threatening the enemy's flank and rear; the main force engaged in a point-by-point, line-by-line, and bunker-by-bunker battle for the important positions of the enemy in the mountainous area north of Puzhen. After a night of fierce fighting, all the enemy's main positions were captured. On the morning of the 22nd, the enemy guarding Puzhen and Pukou, fearing annihilation by our army, fled south in a panic. In order to intercept the enemy, our army quickly pursued them fiercely, rushing towards Pukou.

    On the highway from Puzhen to Pukou, there were enemy corpses everywhere, the roadsides were covered with landmines, the newly built highway bridge was burning with raging fire, and piles of stones and chevaux-de-frise blocked the road. Our pursuing troops paid no attention to all of this, but like a tide, they surged irresistibly along the main roads and small paths towards Pukou.

    Looking across the river, the city of Nanjing was clearly visible: the purplish-gold Zhongshan Mountain, the gray city walls, and the surging Yangtze River... This city, historically known as "Zhongshan winding like a dragon, Stone City crouching like a tiger," was now emitting pillars of fire into the sky, with constant explosions. Chiang Kai-shek's twenty-two years of reactionary rule had turned it into a living hell, and at the end of this dynasty, the enemy, facing imminent death, wanted to destroy it into a pile of rubble.

    When we arrived at Pukou, the enemy, in order to buy time to escape, launched a frantic counterattack against Pukou using its navy and air force, sending batches of shells to Jiangbei. But no matter what, their doom was imminent. Our troops occupying Pukou re-examined the deployment for crossing the Yangtze River by force and prepared to cross the Yangtze River immediately at the fastest speed.

    "One minute earlier into Nanjing, one minute earlier to end Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule; one minute earlier into Nanjing, one minute earlier to save the people of Nanjing from one minute of suffering!" This has become the battle cry of our entire army, and it tightly grips the heartstrings of every commander and fighter. However, when the enemy retreated, they looted all the boats in Jiangbei; we searched all over Pukou, but could not find a single boat. Just as we were worried, we saw a group of people find two small boats from somewhere, one capable of carrying eight people and the other capable of carrying ten people, one of which did not even have a scull. Even so, it solved no small problem for our army, and we decided to immediately organize the crossing of the river with these two small boats.

    Crossing the Yangtze River and Liberating Nanjing

    At dusk on April 23, just as the colored signal flares rose, the flaming shells flew towards the enemy's positions south of the Yangtze River. Under the cover of powerful artillery fire, we selected eighteen elite scouts from the entire army. Each of them carrying a Thompson submachine gun, a selective-fire pistol, and four hand grenades, they steered the two small boats to cross the river first. These eighteen warriors crossed the approximately two-kilometer-wide river surface. About twenty minutes later, they brought back a small steamboat capable of carrying more than thirty people. The second batch of more than thirty people crossed the river and brought back a large steamboat capable of carrying more than three hundred people. The third batch of more than three hundred people crossed the river... At this time, the workers in Xiaguan, hearing that we were crossing the river from Pukou, immediately pushed their wooden boats to Jiangbei to welcome their own troops. The workers at the Nanjing Power Plant also drove the "Jingdian" small steamer that they had hidden. At midnight, on the wide river surface, waves splashed, and boats shuttled back and forth, as our entire army advanced towards Nanjing.

    "Comrades of the People's Liberation Army, you've worked hard!"

    "Brothers, workers! Thank you for your support!"

    The enthusiastic cheers of the workers and soldiers merged into one.

    After crossing the river, we quickly controlled the surrounding highlands of Nanjing, such as Lion Mountain and Zijin Mountain. I constantly received good news from the troops:

    "We have already occupied Chiang Kai-shek's official residence. The huge map marking the situation of the Huaihai Campaign is still hanging intact on the wall..."

    "We have already occupied the Presidential Palace. The calendar in the Presidential Palace only turned to April 22nd..."

    On April 24, Lin Zun, commander of the Kuomintang Second Fleet, declared an uprising on the surface of the Badaoshan River northeast of Nanjing with twenty-five ships under his command. The Kuomintang remnant 4th Division that had fled to the Tangshan area also surrendered to our unit. Chiang Kai-shek's more than twenty years of reactionary rule was officially declared over!

    While the Kuomintang reactionary government fled east and west, American Ambassador John Leighton Stuart remained in Nanjing, not fleeing with the Kuomintang. He attempted to find a new foothold and continue to carry out sabotage activities. But the Chinese people have stood up! John Leighton Stuart stared, what did he see? He saw the ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the awakening and unity of the Chinese people. Seeing that no one was paying attention to him, John Leighton Stuart, who had been carrying out sabotage activities in China for many years, had to pack his briefcase and slip away.

    A New Battle Has Just Begun

    The liberation of Nanjing does not mean the end of the struggle.

    On the eve of liberation, Chiang Kai-shek planned and deployed a large number of special agents and bandits, leaving behind a large number of scattered soldiers and stragglers. After we entered Nanjing, there were still occasional gunshots and stray bullets. Subsequently, many "Communist Party branches" and "New Fourth Army detachments" appeared on the streets. These "branches" and "detachments" were restless everywhere, spreading rumors and carrying out sabotage. Our troops launched a more complex and arduous struggle against the enemy on this hidden front.

    At that time, the responsible comrades of the General Front Committee had not yet arrived in Nanjing. Based on the situation, we had to take immediate measures to eliminate the remnants of the enemy, place Nanjing under military control, and at the same time, we had to prepare to deal with enemy plane harassment and bombings. We decided to temporarily divide Nanjing into three military control zones, each responsible for a zone by three divisions. With the cooperation and help of the local Party, we formed a strong patrol team, effectively controlled the entire city, ensured the tranquility of social order, and smashed the sabotage activities of enemy agents and latent armed forces.

    After the work was deployed, we patrolled the post-war city of Nanjing. What we saw was, on the one hand, the luxury of the Kuomintang's "Lizi Society", the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense, and the pseudo-Presidential Palace, and on the other hand, the closure of factories, the destruction of schools, and the extreme misery of the vast working people who lacked clothing and food. Although the workers and students launched a heroic factory and school protection movement under the leadership of our underground party before and after the liberation of Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek's more than twenty years of rule had ruined the city beyond recognition. To build a new city for the people on this dilapidated foundation, this is another battle that has just begun.

    When the Nanjing Military Control Commission and the People's Government were established soon, we were ordered to join the ranks of the million-strong army that was sweeping across southern Jiangsu and continue to pursue the Kuomintang remnant forces that had lost their combat effectiveness!

    王朝末日
    ——回忆解放南京的战斗
    何克希
    准备直捣敌人老巢
    辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役之后，国民党反动军队的主力已被消灭，美帝国主义在中国殖民统治的傀儡蒋介石政府，像一只破船正在历史上沉没。中国人民革命的胜利已成定局，摆在中国人民面前的主要任务是迅速打过长江去，解放全中国！
    就在这个时候，国民党反动政府为了保存残余力量和美帝国主义在华的侵略势力，企图取得一个喘息机会，发表了战犯求和的声明。党中央、毛主席彻底揭穿了敌人企图赢得时间，然后卷土重来扑灭革命的假和平阴谋，并提出八项条件作为和平协定的原则。
    我们深深懂得，不管谈判的结果如何，人民解放军都是要渡江南下向全国进军的，革命一定要进行到底。所以根据中央指示，我百万大军在4月间积极准备全线突破国民党所谓的“千里江防”，解放全中国。
    我们第二、第三野战军在获得淮海战役的大捷以后，就挥师南进，直捣长江。前委决定：以三个军的兵力准备从南京东、西过江，向纵深挺进，我们这个军就担负了从正面夺取浦口，相机进取南京的光荣任务。
    我从指挥部接受任务回来，兄弟部队已开始向两侧移动。为了加强我军的领导，兵团何以祥参谋长抱病前来，同我们一道进行现地勘察。
    浦口、浦镇地区，丘陵起伏，山头上布满了弯弯曲曲的交通沟和坟冢般的地堡群。浦镇通往浦口的公路，在丘陵间蜿蜒伸展，宽阔的路面上到处是成堆的石头，并挖有防御沟，道岔路口还构筑了各式碉堡。浦镇、浦口、江浦互为犄角，构成一条坚固的防线。这证明敌人丝毫没有放下武器的表现，只是妄想利用这一带有利的地形，阻挠我军前进，确保他们的老巢——南京的安全。
    看罢地形，我们更体会到党中央和毛主席以革命的两手对付反革命的两手的指示的英明，立即召集各师指挥员共同研究战斗部署。何参谋长说：
    “何政委，你们看怎么个打法？”
    我说：“不能与敌人在江北纠缠，要按照毛主席的指示，迅速集中优势兵力，先求歼灭敌人，然后过江直扑南京。这就要首先拿下右翼的江浦，再从正面夺取浦镇，再取浦口，并争取先机过江。”
    大家纷纷发言以后，何参谋长点点头说：“就这样决定吧！”
    不准敌人负隅顽抗
    4月20日，南京国民党政府最后选择了自绝于人民的道路，拒绝了“国内和平协定”的最后修正案。当晚，我们接到了毛主席、朱总司令的命令：奋勇前进，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭中国境内一切敢于抵抗的国民党反动派，解放全国人民，保卫中国领土主权的独立和完整。由于我们有充分的准备，我军于21日零点，即开始了攻击。部队打得很猛，虽然敌人还在组织兵力顽抗，仅仅几个小时的时间，就接到了两个师的捷报：一个师占领了江浦县城，全歼敌人，俘获甚大；一个师扫清了浦镇的前进阵地，予敌重创。就在这同时，又接到了兵团的通报：从昨夜开始，我三十万大军，已在中路首先突破芜湖、安庆一线，渡过江去。
    形势的发展明白地告诉我们，我百万大军正以秋风扫落叶之势，在西起九江东北的湖口、东至江阴，长达五百余公里的战线上突破敌人所吹嘘的“千里江防”。我放下电报立即用电话通知各师猛插浦镇、浦口，争取以最快速度，打过长江，解放南京。
    21日白天，我军以一部分兵力积极地向左侧进攻，威胁敌人侧背；主力部队与敌在浦镇以北山地敌人的重要阵地进行着逐点、逐线、逐个碉堡的争夺战。经过彻夜激战，将敌人主要阵地全部占领。22日晨，浦镇、浦口守敌害怕被我全歼，慌忙南逃。为了截击敌人，我军迅速猛追，奔向浦口。
    从浦镇通往浦口的公路上，到处是敌人的尸体，公路两旁遍布地雷，新架的公路桥燃着熊熊大火，一堆堆的石头、鹿砦阻拦着道路。我们的追击部队哪顾得这一切，只是像潮水一样势不可当地沿着大路小道，涌向浦口。
    隔江眺望，南京城历历在目，紫金色的钟山，灰暗的城墙，汹涌澎湃的大江……这座历史上所谓的“钟山龙蟠，石城虎踞”的名城，现在却冒起冲天火柱，爆炸声频传不绝。蒋介石二十二年的反动统治，把它变成了人间地狱，在这王朝末日的时候，死到临头的敌人又想把它毁为一片瓦砾。
    当我们到达浦口的时候，敌人又为了争取逃跑的时间，利用其海军空军向浦口发动了疯狂的反击，把成批的炮弹掀向江北。可是无论如何，他们的厄运已是近在旦夕了。我们占领浦口的部队，再次研究了强渡长江的部署，准备立即以最快的速度强渡长江。
    “早一分钟进南京，早一分钟结束蒋介石的反动统治；早进南京一分钟，早使南京人民少受一分钟的损失！”这已成为我们全军的战斗号令，它紧紧地扣住了每个指战员的心弦。但是敌人在溃退的时候，把江北的船只全部掳掠一空；我们找遍了浦口，也找不到一只船，正在着急，却见一伙群众不知从哪里找来两只小船，一只可载八个人，一只可载十个人，其中一只还没有橹。虽然如此，也给我军解决了不小问题，我们决定就靠这两只小船马上组织渡江。
  打过长江，解放南京
    4月23日黄昏，彩色的信号弹刚刚升起，曳着火焰的炮弹，便飞向了江南敌人的阵地。在强大的炮火掩护下，我们在全军中挑选了十八个精悍的侦察兵，每人带着一支汤姆枪、一支快慢机和四个手榴弹，驾着两只小船，首先过江。这十八个勇士，横渡了二公里左右宽阔的江面，约二十分钟后，就搞来了一只可载三十余人的小汽船。第二批三十余人过江，又搞来了一只可载三百余人的大汽船，第三批三百余人过江……。这时，下关的工人听到我们从浦口过江，立即撑着木船纷纷来到江北迎接自己的队伍，南京电厂的工人们也把收藏起来的“京电”小汽轮开来。午夜，在宽阔的江面上，浪花飞溅，舟楫如梭，我军全部向南京挺进。
    “解放军同志，你们辛苦了！”
    “工人兄弟们！谢谢你们的支援！”
    工人和战士们的热烈欢呼声融成了一片。
    过江以后，我们迅速地控制了南京周围的狮子山、紫金山等高地。我不断接到部队的捷报：
    “我们已经占领了蒋介石官邸，标示着淮海战役形势的巨幅地图，还完整地挂在墙上……。”
    “我们已经占领了总统府，总统府的日历只翻到4月22日……。”
    4月24日，国民党第二舰队司令林遵率所属舰艇二十五艘，在南京东北的笆斗山江面宣告起义。逃往汤山地区的国民党残敌第四师也向我部投诚。蒋介石二十余年的反动统治，至此正式宣告灭亡！
    在国民党反动政府东逃西散的时候，美国大使司徒雷登却仍留在南京，没有和国民党一块逃跑。他企图找到一个新的立脚点，继续进行破坏活动。但是中国人民已经站起来了！司徒雷登瞪起眼睛看着，他看到了什么呢？看到的是中国人民解放军的行列，是中国人民的觉醒和团结。看看没人去理睬他，这个多年来在中国进行破坏活动的司徒雷登，不得不挟起皮包溜走了。
    新的战斗刚刚开始
    南京解放了，并不意味着斗争的结束。
    解放前夕，蒋介石有计划地布置了大批的特务土匪，遗留下大批的散兵游勇。我们进入南京以后，还时有枪声、流弹声。接着，街道上出现了不少的“共产党支部”与“新四军支队”的牌号，这些“支部”与“支队”到处蠢动，散布谣言进行破坏。我们部队在这隐蔽的战线上，与敌人展开了更复杂更艰巨的斗争。
    当时总前委的负责同志尚未到达南京。根据情况，必须立即采取措施，肃清残敌，军管南京，同时还得准备对付敌机的骚扰和轰炸。我们决定将南京临时划分为三个军管分区，由三个师各负责一个区，在地方党的配合与帮助下，组成了强大的巡逻队，有效地控制全城，确保社会秩序的安宁，粉碎敌特和潜伏武装的破坏活动。
    工作部署之后，我们巡视了战后的南京城。我们所看到的，一方面是国民党的“励志社”、伪国防部和伪总统府等的豪华奢侈，一方面是工厂倒闭，学校破坏，广大劳动人民少衣无食，过着极其悲惨的生活。虽然南京解放前后，在我们地下党领导下，工人学生展开了英勇的护厂、护校运动，但是由于蒋介石二十多年的统治，已把这个城市糟蹋得不像样子了。要在这个破烂不堪的摊子上，建设人民的新城市，这又是一场刚刚开始的战斗。
    当南京市军管会和人民政府建立不久，我们又奉命投入正在横扫江南的百万雄师的行列，继续向已经失掉战斗力的国民党残余军队猛追！
