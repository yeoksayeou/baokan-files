Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, October 31st - Shehu, Chairman of the Albanian Council of Ministers, delivered a report on the international situation and Albania's foreign policy at the fifth session of the Fourth People's Assembly of Albania on October 25th.

Shehu said that the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly was convened on September 20th amidst a tense international situation. After returning to the country, allow me to present to the People's Assembly the views of our government on the international situation and our foreign policy, which is also what our delegation presented at the ongoing 15th UN General Assembly.

In his report, Shehu pointed out that the main issue of concern to people all over the world today is the prevention of war and the safeguarding of world peace. The world is currently divided into two parts: one is the world of peace, composed of socialist countries and other peace-loving independent countries, as well as the broad masses of people in all other countries; the other is the world that opposes the world that demands and maintains peace, namely the world of war, which is composed of international imperialism led by the United States.

	The Balance of Power on the International Stage is Favorable to Socialism and Peace
	But the Closer Imperialism Gets to its End, the More Aggressive it Becomes

Shehu said that the UN General Assembly a year ago was held under conditions of a certain degree of relative easing of international tensions, while this year it is being held under conditions of a sharp intensification of the international situation.

Shehu then listed the main facts, such as the US plane infringing on the Soviet Union, sabotaging the Paris Four-Power Summit, intensifying subversive activities against socialist countries, interfering in Cuba and the Congo, and intensifying the arms race, pointing out that these are the roots of the intensified international situation.

Shehu emphasized that the root of the war policy and aggression policy consistently pursued by Western countries, especially the United States, lies in the nature of imperialism itself, that is, the social system itself, whose nature is aggression and launching wars. Our party firmly adheres to the Leninist view that imperialism is the source of war. As long as imperialism exists for one day, even in a very small part of the world, the foundation and danger of imperialist war and aggression will exist for one day. Whether imperialism can launch aggression and war is another matter, which depends not only on the wishes and nature of imperialism, but also on the forces opposing it, and on the development of the balance of power in today's international situation that is forever favorable to socialism and unfavorable to imperialism.

We deny the argument of those revisionists who believe that imperialism, under pressure from changes in the international balance of power that favor socialism and the peace movement, has changed its nature and lost its aggressive and bellicose nature, as if the governments of the United States and other imperialist countries are also advocating peace in today's situation. This revisionist view is either blind deception or whitewashing imperialism, both of which are paralyzing the vigilance of the people and helping imperialism cover up their war preparations. The "solemn" declarations of "advocating peace" and "peaceful cooperation" between countries or giving "independence" to colonial countries made by Eisenhower, Macmillan, and other representatives of imperialist countries can only deceive those who are naive. No matter what deceptive means imperialism uses, its aggressive and plundering nature is the same as the nature when imperialism as a social system was produced, and it will remain so until imperialism is eliminated from every corner of the earth. Today, imperialism is in a state of complete collapse and is approaching death. However, the closer imperialism gets to its end and the closer it gets to inevitable death, the more aggressive it becomes due to the role of its unchanging nature until death. Imperialism is like a wounded beast, although it no longer has the strength it once had, it is preparing to counterattack the hunters more frantically because of its injury. It is making a final death struggle before ending its bestial life.

Shehu stressed that the events in international life in recent times and the 15th session of the UN General Assembly have once again proved that no matter how weakened imperialism has become, and no matter how strong we have become, imperialism will not abandon its war plans and change its nature. However, imperialism is no longer the absolute master of the world today, and as a social system, it is on its deathbed. Today, the balance of power on the international stage has changed in favor of socialism and peace.

If the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted the Soviet government's proposal to discuss the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples at the General Assembly, then this does not in any way indicate any "good intentions" of the Western imperialist countries. In fact, they issued statements firmly opposing the corresponding Soviet proposal. This is the result of the strong and irresistible national liberation movement and anti-colonialist movement of the oppressed people and colonial people, the result of the international balance of power changing unfavorably to imperialism, and mainly the result of the peaceful policies of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.

Regarding the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, there has been some progress this year. The US government can only force the United Nations to accept its will with a majority of eight votes, so that this issue is not included in the agenda of this year's General Assembly. This does not in any way prove that the aggressive and bellicose nature of imperialism has changed. On the contrary, it is the result of the joint efforts of socialist countries, first of all the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries, and the result of the growth of the international prestige of the People's Republic of China. This is completely contrary to the wishes and will of imperialism.

World Imperialism Always Attempts to Eliminate the Socialist System
Whoever Forgets This Truth Rolls Into the Revisionist Mire

Shehu said that today, the profound causes of international tensions should be sought from within the imperialist system, that is, from the further intensification of the contradictions of imperialism.

This tension is primarily the result of the further intensification of the contradiction between the two world systems—socialism and capitalism. The continuous strengthening of the entire world socialist system, especially the magnificent achievements of the Soviet Union and People's China in various fields of life, has made imperialism more frantic, making them increasingly feel close to inevitable death, and thus their aggressive nature is increasingly exposed. Imperialism, especially US imperialism, is absolutely unwilling to accept this situation, and will do everything possible to regain lost ground and prepare for the Third World War. The main and final purpose of world imperialism throughout its existence was, is, and will remain to be: to eliminate the socialist system and eliminate any revolutionary phenomena and factors by any means. Whoever forgets this truth loses a realistic sense of the aggressive nature of imperialism and rolls into the revisionist mire.

Today, the international tension is also the result of the further intensification of the contradiction between the monopolistic groups and colonialist and imperialist countries in capitalist countries and the national liberation movement and anti-imperialist movement of the oppressed colonial people.

Today, another reason for the international tension is the further intensification of the contradictions between the imperialist countries themselves. The uneven development of capitalist countries is now more prominent, which is one of the most significant characteristics of the era of imperialism. But it must be taken into account that on the issue of opposing socialism and communism, the ideas and paths of the imperialist powers, that is, preparing for war and eliminating socialism, are consistent.

The last reason for the international tension is the further intensification of the contradiction between the monopoly groups and the working masses in capitalist countries.

All of this proves the correctness of the conclusions of the 1957 "Peace Manifesto" of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. All of this shows that the nature of aggression and war of the entire imperialism, especially US imperialism, has not only not changed, but will not change, but has become more blatant.

However, although the aggressive nature of imperialism is more blatant, war is not inevitable today, because there are forces in the world today that can prevent war. To turn this possibility into reality, first of all, the people of all countries must not relax their vigilance against the aggressive attempts of imperialism, and maintain the strength advantage of the socialist camp over the imperialist camp. The advantage of the socialist camp lies not only in military strength, but mainly in the unity of the socialist camp. We should also mobilize all the people of all countries in the world to rise up against imperialism and defend peace. Historical experience has proved the correctness of Stalin's words: he said that if the people of all countries take on the cause of maintaining peace and persist in this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated.

In today's realistic situation of the international balance of power, imperialism takes as its task to try every means and unscrupulous means to change the balance of power to its own advantage. The way to achieve this task is through a frenzied arms race, through ideological corrosion, undermining the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, and weakening the socialist camp from within in order to create favorable conditions for eliminating revolutionary forces in the rear of imperialism. The main tool used by imperialism in this regard is modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav revisionist leadership group.

Disarmament is Inseparable from the Struggle Against Imperialism
Relying Solely on Negotiations, Imperialist Countries Will Never Accept Disarmament

Shehu said that the Albanian Party and government have consistently and resolutely struggled for peace and for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social and political systems.

However, peaceful coexistence cannot be guaranteed by empty talk and statements alone. It requires concrete actions and measures by governments and countries that are willing to coexist.

Shehu recalled that negotiations between socialist camp countries and Western imperialist countries on disarmament have been going on for more than ten years, but no concrete results have been achieved to this day. The responsibility lies solely with the imperialists. The facts clearly show that imperialist countries are the enemies of disarmament and peace, and US imperialism is the number one enemy of peace and freedom of the people of all countries.

Shehu said that while we unreservedly support the Soviet proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, we do not have any illusions about the attempts and wishes of imperialist countries on this issue. Our government believes that relying solely on negotiations, even negotiations in international institutions such as the UN General Assembly, imperialist countries, especially the United States, will not only never accept complete and thorough disarmament, but will also never accept partial disarmament. Only by relying on all peace-loving people, relying on all peace forces in the world, relying first of all on the united strength of the socialist camp countries, relying on the comprehensive and continuous consolidation of the socialist camp, and relying on the fighting unity of all peace-loving forces in the world to form a united front for peace, can we force imperialist countries to accept the Soviet disarmament proposal. Disarmament is inseparable from the struggle of the people of all countries against the aggression and war policies of world imperialism, especially US imperialism.

Colonialist Countries Suppress National Liberation Movements by Any Means
Only the Struggle of the Oppressed People Can Eliminate Colonialism

The collapse of the colonial system vividly proves that imperialism has decayed and is approaching death. However, although imperialism has suffered heavy blows, it has not been completely buried. Nearly a hundred regions with more than 130 million people are still under colonial oppression.

Shehu said that Albania fully supports the Soviet statement "on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples" at the 15th session of the UN General Assembly. Of course, we do not have any illusions, such as it seems that imperialism will give colonial people true freedom as a result of certain UN resolutions. We are deeply convinced that imperialists will hinder the reaching of such resolutions by any means, and even if the UN General Assembly makes such resolutions, imperialist countries will not allow it to be realized no matter what.

Only through the resolute struggle of the oppressed colonial people, with the sympathy and support of progressive humanity, can colonialism be finally eliminated. The liberation of the people is their own business. Our people, who have a long and glorious history of struggling for freedom and national independence, completely stand with the anti-imperialist national liberation struggle of the people of all countries under barbaric colonial oppression.

Imperialist countries, headed by US imperialism, are doing their utmost to implement the policy of using the UN flag as a weapon to cover up colonialism in the struggle against the national liberation of the oppressed colonial people. A few years ago, the aggression of US imperialism and its allies against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was covered up under the UN flag. This year, the UN flag covered up the imperialist aggression against the Congo, suppressing the just struggle of the Congolese people for their freedom and independence and against Belgian colonialists.

Guaranteeing Peace Must Never Rely on the "Good Intentions" of Imperialists
Losing Vigilance Against Aggressors Will Bring Humanity Into the Abyss of War

Shehu then condemned the US government's hostile actions against the Albanian delegation attending the UN General Assembly. He said that during the twenty days of our delegation in New York, we lived and worked under prison conditions. But we are very proud, because the discrimination against us by the Eisenhower authorities shows that the path taken by the People's Republic of Albania is correct, because it is hated and opposed by the imperialists. We treat the enemies of our people like flies and maggots. The hell on earth in Wall Street left us with the worst impression. It concentrates 65% of the wealth of the capitalist world. When we returned to the socialist paradise and returned to our glorious motherland, we were revived. Here, the wind of true freedom blows.

Shehu emphasized that we cannot disarm ourselves in the face of the armed-to-the-teeth imperialist aggressors. Because this means putting the motherland in danger, at the mercy of the imperialist wolves, and at the mercy of the most frantic enemies of our peace-loving people of all countries. On all issues related to guaranteeing peace and the safety of the people of all countries, we cannot rely on the "good intentions" of the imperialists at all. Because the imperialists were, are, and will always be the frantic enemies of peace and socialism. Any loss of vigilance and any concessions to the bellicose imperialist aggressors will bring humanity into the abyss of a new world war.

The Shameless Slanders Against China by Imperialists and Revisionists
Proves that China Stands on the Correct Path of Marxism-Leninism

Shehu said that one of the most important and pressing international issues at the United Nations is the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. Everyone knows that it is obvious that what is illegally occupying China's current seat in the United Nations in violation of international norms and reason is a living corpse that does not represent anyone—the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The great Chinese people threw this group into the cesspool with their revolutionary victory in 1949.

The US government is doing its utmost to hate People's China and the Chinese people. To achieve this, its representative Wadsworth declared in the form of an ultimatum at the 15th UN General Assembly: "If the UN General Assembly passes a resolution to allow the People's Republic of China to occupy a seat in the United Nations, then the United States will withdraw from this organization." This position of the US government clearly proves the sinister face of US imperialism.

Today, the People's Republic of China has become a socialist power, and it is advancing on the road of progress at a great pace. People's China is eliminating the serious economic and cultural backwardness left over from the era of foreign imperialism and domestic exploiting classes at an extremely fast speed. In a short period of time, it has resolutely embarked on the road of becoming a powerful industrial country with advanced agriculture, modern world-class technology, and science. The great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in socialist construction have amazed everyone. This proves that the great and talented Chinese people have endless creative abilities, proves their iron-like unity around their glorious Communist Party and their democratic government, and proves the revolutionary transformation power of the socialist system.

China is a socialist power that accounts for a quarter of the world's population, three times more than the population of the United States. Its special position in the international community makes it impossible to smoothly resolve any major international issues without the participation of the People's Republic of China. Although imperialists do not like this reality, this is an indisputable fact.

How can the United Nations be said to be an international organization without the most populous country in the world—People's China? Without the participation of the People's Republic of China, how can the United Nations expect to solve major international issues such as disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and nuclear weapons, and various aspects of peace and international cooperation? China has officially stated that without its participation and the signature of its official representatives, it will not be bound by any international agreements. This is completely correct. Everyone can understand that as long as the Chiang Kai-shek puppet exists in the United Nations instead of the representative of the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of China will not participate in any conferences organized by the United Nations to resolve major international issues. In this case, no matter how many resolutions the United Nations can pass, these resolutions can only be a scrap of paper. To make them a reality, they must have the support of a powerful China, and the participation of the People's Republic of China.

The issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is becoming more and more urgent and necessary to be resolved day by day for the prestige of the United Nations. However, US imperialism and its allies are doing their utmost to obstruct the restoration of the legitimate rights of People's China. To this end, they fabricated new and most despicable slanders against the People's Republic of China, saying that People's China is an "aggressor" country, "does not want peace," "wants war," and so on. However, all the "arguments" of the US imperialists and their lackeys against the People's Republic of China are so stupid and unfounded that Mr. Wadsworth, the Permanent Representative of the US Government to the United Nations, had to resort this time to the trump card in the dark arsenal of imperialist slanders—the faltering "arguments" of the most loyal and dangerous servant of US imperialism, the Yugoslav revisionists.

On October 8 this year, Wadsworth quoted Tito verbatim at the UN General Assembly: "It is also interesting that the Chinese leaders are attacking our foreign policy (that is, the policy of coexistence between countries and people of different systems). Comrades, the problem is that these people do not like our peace policy (that is, the policy of coexistence). But war cannot solve the difficulties encountered in building socialism in a country with 600 million people. The fact is that the people of this country like the statement that they will still have 300 million people left in the event of war and similar conflicts. It means that 300 million people will die and 300 million people will be saved. But those who are left are no one else, just themselves." Wadsworth also said: "This is quoted from Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia's speech on June 15, 1958. It is indeed very clear to the Chinese Communists now..."

Wadsworth said this, comrades, please see where things have been led to! Of course, when the revisionist marshal hears the words he said against China in Yugoslavia in 1958 being repeated in the United Nations in 1960 through the mouth of his master—the American Wadsworth, he will be shocked. But on the other hand, this will be used as a "powerful argument" to solicit more dollars from US imperialism to build "special socialism" and oppose international communism.

In this recent period, it is not at all accidental that the Yugoslav revisionists have tried to "theoretically" "prove" the US imperialist argument that People's China "does not like peace but advocates war." To this end, the extremely arrogant book "Socialism and War" written by the revisionist boss Kardelj was published. In this book, he made the most vile and fabricated slanders against the People's Republic of China, saying that the Chinese Communist Party is a "dogmatic" party, and that the People's Republic of China is an "aggressor" country, "does not advocate peace, does not advocate peaceful coexistence," but "advocates atomic war," and so on. It is not at all accidental that all opportunists and modern revisionists echo the theories of the revisionist boss Kardelj, and even "compete" with revisionism. Whoever slanders the People's Republic of China more will more quickly and more quickly elevate this fabricated slander to "theory." This proves that the People's Republic of China is standing on the right path, on the path of Marxism-Leninism. Shehu said that our party, government, and people are proud to have such an ally as the People's Republic of China. It is marching toward socialism and communism under the glorious leadership of the great heroic Chinese Communist Party and its Leninist Central Committee headed by the indomitable Marxist-Leninist fighter, the great son of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong.

China Stands at the Forefront of the Struggle to Defend World Peace
Made Valuable Contributions to the Formulation of the Principles of Peaceful Coexistence

Completely contrary to the shameless slanders of US imperialism and its revisionist servants, the People's Republic of China stands at the forefront of the struggle to defend world peace and strive for the victory of the principles of peaceful coexistence. The People's Republic of China is a huge factor in peace in the Far East and the world. Everyone knows its great contribution to the armistice agreements in Korea and Vietnam. It unilaterally withdrew its volunteers from Korea, while today, the United States still maintains its troops in South Korea, making it a dangerous source of atomic aggression in the Far East. Everyone also knows the valuable contributions of the People's Republic of China in formulating the principles of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and its contribution to the Bandung Conference, and so on.

The People's Republic of China is constantly expanding and strengthening its friendly relations and trade and cultural ties with other countries. Today, it has established diplomatic relations with thirty-five countries, trades with nearly ninety countries, and has cultural ties with the vast majority of countries and regions in the world. In accordance with the spirit of strengthening peace and cooperation between countries, the People's Republic of China has continuously strengthened its friendly relations with neighboring countries. In the past and present, it has supported the Soviet Union's correct proposals on disarmament, and has itself made significant initiatives to eliminate the danger of war and strengthen international peaceful cooperation. Of particular significance in this regard is Comrade Zhou Enlai's proposal to conclude a treaty of non-aggression and peace between Asian countries, especially countries along the Pacific Ocean, including the United States, and to turn the region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. This proves that the People's Republic of China is implementing a peaceful policy. This truth cannot be diminished by the imperialists' criticisms and stupid slanders and the "special" "theories" of their revisionist servants.

In order to perpetuate the occupation of Taiwan and other islands by the US military, the imperialists also fabricated the so-called "two Chinas" theory. The Chinese people and our people reject this "theory." Taiwan and the surrounding islands are Chinese territory and belong to China. We firmly support the right of the People's Republic of China to liberate these islands and believe that this is the internal affair of People's China.

The results of the voting this year on the issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations prove that the international prestige of the People's Republic of China is constantly increasing.

We are deeply convinced that the day is not far off when the People's Republic of China will enter the United Nations and drive away the Chiang Kai-shek puppet; we are equally convinced that one day, Taiwan and other surrounding islands will also be liberated and return to the embrace of the great People's China.

We believe that the United Nations needs People's China more than People's China needs the United Nations, so one day the United Nations itself will ask People's China to occupy its seat in this organization. Because imperialism can never impose its will on the United Nations forever.

Our delegation also asked the United Nations at the 15th UN General Assembly to admit Mongolia as a member of the United Nations.

Shehu said that the characteristic of the 15th session of the UN General Assembly is the struggle between two diametrically opposed lines in international relations, that is, the sharp struggle between the peaceful line consistently followed by the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and many other peace-loving countries and the war line pursued by the imperialist countries headed by the United States.

Socialist Countries and Many Neutral Countries Love Peace
But We Must Always Be Prepared to Give Aggressors a Fatal Blow

In general, on the most important issues in current international life, the position of the socialist countries is consistent with the position of many neutral countries that stand on the anti-imperialist position and are closely concerned with defending and consolidating peace. Continuously strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the socialist camp countries and neutral countries such as India, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, Ghana, and Guinea on the most important issues in current international politics is a very important factor in consolidating world peace.

The question is: What is the prospect for the development of the international situation? Can international tensions ease again? We believe that the current intensification of international tensions is a temporary phenomenon. We believe that the days of re-easing international tensions will come. We say this not because we have any illusions about imperialism, but based on the international balance of power. Only peace forces can force imperialism to ease international tensions. Today, there are peace forces sufficient to prevent imperialism from intensifying the Cold War, and even such forces are sufficient, and there is a real possibility, to prevent the outbreak of a new world war.

The basis of our realistic optimism lies first of all in: the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp and the attractiveness of this camp to the peace-loving people of all countries in the world who advocate opposing a new world war and guaranteeing world peace; on the other hand, our basis lies in the fact that the overall weakening and overall decay of imperialism is making it increasingly precarious. At the same time, we must maintain the greatest vigilance against the plots and activities of the imperialists, and be ready at any time to give every aggressor a fatal blow. As the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties emphasized: "As long as imperialism exists, there is soil for aggressive war."

We fully believe that the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties is correct in pointing out this point after talking about the powerful forces of the cause of defending peace in the contemporary era: "The alliance of these powerful forces can prevent the outbreak of war. If the imperialist warmongers insist on launching a war at all costs, then imperialism is doomed to perish, because the people will never tolerate the system that brings them such terrible pain and sacrifice."

Tito Plays a卑鄙 Role of Serving the Imperialists
We Must Unswervingly Struggle Against Modern Revisionism

Speaking of the activities of the Yugoslav delegation at the United Nations, Shehu said that President Tito, who led the Yugoslav delegation, also attended this UN General Assembly. Tito's characteristic in New York was: he intensified his activities to organize the "third camp," specifically, he tried to make neutral countries leave their sympathy for socialist countries and serve imperialism like himself. In our opinion, Tito's speech was a sinister and deceptive speech. Tito's speech and his deceptive remarks about disarmament, "opposition" to colonialism, and the danger of war can only deceive naive people and fools. He did not say a single word against imperialism. He did not specifically mention who was exploiting the colonial people. He did not say a single word to expose US imperialism. How could a disreputable and loyal servant say words against his master? When the American Wadsworth quoted Tito's speech against People's China (see, how "loyal" Tito is!) at the UN General Assembly, where Tito was also present, as the main "argument" against People's China, what meaning did the Yugoslav delegation's vote in favor of admitting People's China as a member of the United Nations have? In order to "improve" Tito's status as a dangerous "communist," the US government organized several "demonstrations" in front of Tito's official residence. In order to continue playing this farce manufactured by the State Department, Yugoslav State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Popovic even filed a verbal protest against the "demonstrations" at the UN General Assembly. All of this was manufactured absurdity in order to portray Tito in the minds of the people, especially in the minds of neutrals, as an anti-imperialist. However, a sieve cannot cover the sun. Those who are even slightly sensible understand that the role Tito played this time, as always, is still 卑鄙.

Our party's position on revisionists has always been and will always be firm. Tito's stay in New York this time makes us even more convinced that in the struggle against imperialism and to guarantee world peace, if we do not wage an unswerving struggle against modern revisionism ideologically, and do not expose it in front of the people of all countries as a dangerous spy serving imperialism, then it is impossible to achieve complete success. Such a struggle and exposure will not only not increase the prestige of the revisionists, as some people imagine, but will break this prestige ideologically. One of Tito's main purposes in going to New York was to increase his prestige. He especially strived to achieve this purpose by means of behind-the-scenes contact.

The Albanian People are Building with a Pick in One Hand and a Gun in the Other
The Glorious Labor Party is Unswervingly Loyal to Marxism-Leninism

Shehu said that the government of the People's Republic of Albania has consistently followed a peaceful foreign policy based on the well-known principles of peaceful coexistence. The cornerstone of our foreign policy has always been, and will always be, the unbreakable friendship between our people and the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and the unbreakable friendship between our people and the great Chinese people and the people of other countries in the socialist camp.

We have always been and will always be committed to implementing a good-neighborly policy toward our neighbors.

We are willing to establish diplomatic relations with any country based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, as long as they have the same desire. Of course, there is one condition, that neither party should have territorial or political demands on the other.

The 15th session of the UN General Assembly once again proved how correct our party's consistent general line is. The party teaches our people to hold a pick in one hand and a gun in the other when struggling to build socialism, and never to lose revolutionary vigilance against the aggressive purposes and activities of imperialism and the activities of the most dangerous imperialist spies—modern revisionism.

Shehu said that the freedom of the Albanian people was not obtained by reaching out to people, but by taking it from the enemy with weapons in hand through struggle. Our people love peace, and we are determined to strive for peace. But if external enemies dare to invade us on that day, then they should know that the people who live here would rather die standing in glorious struggle than live on their knees as slaves. We have considerable experience and know how to defend our freedom to the end, even if necessary, with blood and life. The guarantee of the victory of our party's general line of building socialism and defending the freedom of the people is the high socialist patriotism of our people, and it is our glorious party's indomitable leadership of Marxism-Leninism, consistent to the end, under the wise and firm leadership of the Leninist Central Committee headed by Comrade Hoxha, and it is the unbreakable and eternal friendship of our people with the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union and the people of other countries in the socialist camp.

Shehu finally said that our Labor Party's Fourth Congress will soon be convened in our country. This congress has special historical significance for our party and people. Not long ago, the draft instructions for our country's Third Five-Year Plan for developing the economy and culture on the road to building a socialist society were published, which opened up a bright prospect for our country, but at the same time, the implementation of the plan requires our people to comprehensively mobilize all their strength.

Our government will, as always, follow the general line formulated by the party and mobilize all its strength to gloriously complete the lofty tasks entrusted to it by the people and the party.

Long live our glorious party and its Leninist Central Committee headed by the founder of our party—Comrade Enver Hoxha! Long live our heroic, hardworking, and peace-loving people!

Long live the unbreakable unity of the powerful socialist camp—the indestructible fortress of world peace, headed by the Soviet Union! Long live world peace! (The subtitles in the text were added by the editor of this newspaper)

    谢胡在阿尔巴尼亚人民议会就国际形势和外交政策作报告
    动员世界人民起来反对帝国主义才能保卫和平
    和平的头号敌人美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策是国际紧张局势的根源
    在任何时候都不能对为帝国主义服务的现代修正主义丧失革命警惕性
    新华社地拉那31日电　阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡10月25日在阿尔巴尼亚第四届人民议会第五次会议上作了关于国际形势和阿尔巴尼亚外交政策的报告。
    谢胡说，在国际局势紧张的形势下，今年9月20日召开了联合国大会第十五届会议。在我回到了国内以后，请允许我向人民议会提出我国政府对国际形势的看法和我国的外交政策，这也是我国代表团在正在继续举行的第十五届联大会议上所提出的看法。
    谢胡在报告中指出，今天，全世界人民所关切的主要问题是防止战争和保障世界和平的问题。目前世界被分成两个部分：一个是和平世界，是由社会主义国家和其他爱好和平的独立国家以及世界所有其他国家的广大的人民群众所组成；另一个是同要求和维护和平的世界相对立的世界，即战争的世界，这个世界是由以美国为首的国际帝国主义组成。
    国际舞台力量对比有利于社会主义和和平
    但是帝国主义越接近末日就越富有侵略性
    谢胡说，一年前的联大，是在国际紧张局势有一定程度的相对缓和的情况下举行的，而今年则是在国际局势尖锐化的情况下举行的。
    谢胡接着列举了美国飞机侵犯苏联、破坏巴黎四国会议、对社会主义国家加紧进行颠复活动、干涉古巴和刚果以及加紧扩军备战等主要事实，指出这是国际局势加剧的根源。
    谢胡强调指出，西方国家，特别是美国所一贯奉行的战争政策和侵略政策的根源就在于帝国主义的本性即社会制度本身，其本性就是侵略和发动战争。我们党坚决坚持列宁主义的观点，即帝国主义是战争的根源。只要帝国主义存在一天，那怕是在世界很小一部分地方存在，那么，帝国主义战争和侵略的基础和危险也就存在一天。帝国主义能否发动侵略和战争，这是另一回事，这不只取决于帝国主义的愿望和本性，也取决于反对它的力量，取决于今天国际形势中有利于社会主义的力量对比，这种力量对比的发展将永远有利于社会主义而不利于帝国主义。
    我们否定那些修正主义者的论点，即认为帝国主义迫于国际力量对比有利于社会主义和和平运动的变化就改变了本性，就失去了它的侵略和好战的本性，好像美国和其他帝国主义国家的政府在今天的情况下也是主张和平的。这种修正主义的观点不是盲目的欺骗，就是给帝国主义搽粉，都是在麻痹人民的警惕性，帮助帝国主义掩盖他们的备战活动。艾森豪威尔、麦克米伦和帝国主义国家的其他代表所作的“主张和平”和各国间“和平合作”或给殖民地国家“独立”等等的“庄严”声明，只能欺骗那些幼稚的人。不管帝国主义使用何种欺骗手段，它的侵略和掠夺本性同帝国主义作为一种社会制度产生时的本性一样，在帝国主义从地球上每个角落被消灭之前也将仍然如此。今天帝国主义正处于全面崩溃之中，正在接近死亡。但是，帝国主义越接近末日、越接近不可避免的死亡，由于它至死不变的本性的作用，它就越富于侵略性，帝国主义就像受了伤的野兽一样，虽然它已没有先前的那股力量，但是，由于受伤而越加疯狂地准备向猎人反扑。在它结束兽性的生命之前，作最后一次的垂死挣扎。
    谢胡强调说，最近时期国际生活中的事件和第十五届联大会议再次地证明了，不管帝国主义已被削弱到何种程度，也不管我们已强大到何种程度，帝国主义是不会放弃它的战争计划和改变它的本性的。但是，帝国主义今天已不是当年的世界的绝对主人了，作为社会制度来说，它正是奄奄一息了。今天国际舞台上的力量对比已起了有利于社会主义和和平的变化。
    假如说联大会议一致通过了苏联政府关于在大会上讨论给殖民地国家和人民以独立的提案，那么这丝毫不说明西方帝国主义国家有什么“善心”，事实上，它们发表声明，坚决反对苏联的相应建议。这是被压迫的人民和殖民地人民强大的不可抵抗的民族解放运动、反殖民主义运动的结果，是国际力量对比起了不利于帝国主义的结果，而主要的是以苏联为首的社会主义国家的和平政策的结果。
    在恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的问题上，今年有所进展。美国政府只能以八票的多数强迫联合国接受它的意志，而使这一问题没有列入今年大会的议程。这丝毫不证明帝国主义的侵略和好战的本性有什么改变，恰恰相反，而是社会主义国家，首先是苏联以及其他爱好和平的国家的共同努力的结果，是中华人民共和国国际威信增长的结果，这完全是违背帝国主义的愿望和意志的。
  世界帝国主义始终企图消灭社会主义体系
  谁忘记这条真理谁就滚进了修正主义泥坑
    谢胡说，今天，国际局势紧张的深刻原因应当从帝国主义制度的内部，即从帝国主义的矛盾进一步尖锐化中去寻找。
    这种紧张首先是两个世界体系——社会主义和资本主义之间的矛盾的进一步尖锐化的结果。整个世界社会主义体系的不断加强，特别是苏联和人民中国在生活各个领域中的宏伟成就，使得帝国主义更为疯狂，使它们日益感到接近于不可避免的死亡，因而，其侵略本性愈益显露。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，绝不甘于这种形势，会不惜一切地重新夺回失去的阵地，准备第三次世界大战。世界帝国主义在它整个存在期间主要的和最后的目的过去是、现在是、将来仍然是：消灭社会主义体系，不择手段地消灭任何革命的现象和因素。谁忘记这条真理，谁就是对帝国主义的侵略本性失去了现实感，谁就滚进了修正主义的泥坑。
    今天，国际局势的紧张也是大资本垄断集团和殖民主义、帝国主义国家同被压迫的殖民地人民的民族解放运动和反帝国主义运动之间的矛盾进一步尖锐化的结果。
    今天，国际局势紧张的另一个原因是帝国主义国家本身之间的矛盾的进一步尖锐化。现在资本主义国家发展不平衡的情况更加突出，这是帝国主义时代最重大的特征之一。但必须估计到，在反对社会主义和共产主义的问题上，帝国主义大国的思想和道路，即准备战争和消灭社会主义的道路，都是一致的。
    国际局势紧张的最后一个原因是资本主义国家中垄断集团同劳动群众之间的矛盾的进一步尖锐化。
    这一切都证明了各国共产党和工人党1957年“和平宣言”的结论的正确性。这一切表明，整个帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的侵略和战争的本性，非但没有改变，也不会改变，相反却是更加露骨了。
    但是，帝国主义的侵略本性虽然更为露骨，战争在今天来说却并不是注定不可避免的，因为今天世界上存在着能够防止战争的力量。要使这种可能变为现实，首先要各国人民不放松对帝国主义侵略企图的警惕，保持社会主义阵营对帝国主义阵营的力量优势。社会主义阵营的优势不仅在于军事力量上，而主要的是在于社会主义阵营的团结一致。还应当动员世界各国所有的人民群众起来反对帝国主义，保卫和平。历史经验证明了斯大林的这些话是正确的：他说，如果各国人民把维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。
    在今天国际力量对比的现实形势下，帝国主义把千方百计地、不择一切手段地来改变力量的对比使之有利于自己的图谋列为它的任务。实现这个任务的办法就是通过疯狂的军备竞赛，通过意识形态的腐蚀，破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结，从内部来削弱社会主义阵营，以便为在帝国主义的后方消灭革命力量而创造有利条件。帝国主义在这一方面用来作为主要工具的便是以南斯拉夫修正主义领导集团为代表的现代修正主义。
    裁军同反对帝国主义的斗争是不可分割的
    只靠谈判帝国主义国家永远不会接受裁军
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚党和政府一贯地为争取和平、争取不同社会政治制度国家间和平共处而坚决斗争。
    但是，光靠空话和声明是不能保证和平共处的。它要求各国政府和愿意共处的国家采取具体的行动和措施。
    谢胡回顾说，社会主义阵营国家同西方帝国主义国家之间在裁军问题上的谈判已经进行了十多年了，但直到今天还没有任何具体成果。其责任只是在于帝国主义者。事实清楚地表明，帝国主义国家是裁军和和平的敌人，美帝国主义是各国人民和平和自由的头号敌人。
    谢胡说，我们在毫无保留地支持苏联关于全面彻底裁军的建议的时候，没有对帝国主义国家在此问题上的企图和愿望抱有任何幻想。我国政府相信，光靠谈判、即使是在联大这样的国际机构中的谈判，帝国主义国家，特别是美国，不但永远不会接受全面彻底的裁军，而且也永远不会接受局部裁军。只有依靠全体爱好和平的人民、依靠全世界所有和平力量、依靠首先是社会主义阵营各国团结起来的力量，依靠社会主义阵营的全面的和不断的巩固，依靠全世界所有爱好和平力量结成和平统一战线的战斗团结，才能迫使帝国主义国家接受苏联的裁军建议。裁军同各国人民反对世界帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的斗争是不可分割的。
  殖民主义国家不择手段镇压民族解放运动
  只有被压迫人民的斗争才能消灭殖民主义
    殖民主义制度的崩溃活生生地证明了帝国主义已经腐朽和接近死亡。但是，尽管帝国主义现在遭受到沉重的打击，但还没有完全被埋葬。将近一百多个地区的一亿三千多万人口还处在殖民主义的压迫之下。
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚完全支持苏联在联大十五届会议上提出的“关于给予殖民地国家和人民以独立”的声明。当然，我们不抱有任何幻想，如，似乎帝国主义由于联合国某些决议的结果会给殖民地人民以真正的自由。我们深信，帝国主义者是会不择手段地阻碍这种决议的达成的，即使联大作出了这样的决议，帝国主义国家无论怎样也不会允许它实现。
    只有进行有进步人类同情和支持的被压迫的殖民地人民的坚决斗争，殖民主义才可以最后消灭。人民的解放是他们自己的事，具有为自由和民族独立而斗争的悠久的光荣历史的我国人民，完全同处在殖民主义野蛮压迫下的各国人民的反帝国主义的民族解放斗争站在一起。
    以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义国家在反对被压迫的殖民地人民的民族解放的斗争中极力执行用联合国的旗帜作为武器来掩盖殖民主义的政策。几年前，在联合国的旗帜下掩盖了美帝国主义及其同盟者对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵略，今年联合国的旗帜掩盖了帝国主义对刚果的侵略，镇压为自己的自由和独立和反对比利时殖民主义者的刚果人民的正义斗争。
  保障和平决不能依靠帝国主义者的“善心”
  对侵略者丧失警惕将把人类带进战争深渊
    谢胡接着谴责美国政府对参加联大的阿尔巴尼亚代表团的敌视行动。他说，我们代表团在纽约的二十天期间，我们简直是在监狱的条件下生活和工作的。但我们感到很骄傲，因为艾森豪威尔当局对我们的歧视表明了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国走的道路是正确的，因为它受到帝国主义者的仇视和反对。我们把我国人民的敌人当作苍蝇和蛆一样，华尔街人间地狱给我们留下了最坏的印象。那里集中了资本主义世界65％的财富。当我们回到社会主义的天堂，回到我们光荣的祖国时，我们又复生了。这里飘拂着真正的自由之风。
    谢胡着重指出，不能在武装到牙齿的帝国主义侵略者的面前解除武装。因为这就意味着使祖国遭受危难，听任帝国主义豺狼摆布，听任我们爱好和平的各国人民的最疯狂的敌人摆布。在一切有关保证和平和各国人民安全的问题上，我们丝毫不能依靠帝国主义者的“善心”。因为帝国主义者过去、现在和将来始终都是和平和社会主义的疯狂敌人。我们对好战的帝国主义侵略者的任何丧失警惕的作法和任何让步，将会把人类带进一次新的世界大战的深渊。
  帝国主义者和修正主义者对中国的无耻诬蔑
  证明中国站在马克思列宁主义的正确道路上
    谢胡说，联合国最重大的最切身的国际问题之一，是恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题。大家知道，显然，违反国际准则和理智而窃居中国当前在联合国席位的是不代表任何人的一具活僵尸——蒋介石集团。1949年伟大的中国人民就以他们的革命胜利把这个集团抛到粪坑里去了。
    美国政府竭力仇视人民中国和中国人民。为了达到这一点，它的代表华兹沃斯以最后通牒的形式在十五届联大宣称：“如果联大通过决议，让中华人民共和国占有联合国的席位，那么美国将脱离这一个组织。”美国政府的这种立场清楚地证明了美帝国主义的凶恶面目。
    中华人民共和国今天已成为一个社会主义强国，它以巨大的步伐在进步的道路上迈进。人民中国正在以极快的速度消除过去外国帝国主义和本国剥削阶级统治时代所留下的严重的经济和文化上的落后状态，在短短的期间内，它坚决地走上了成为一个强大的具有先进农业、现代世界水平的技术和科学的工业国的道路。中华人民共和国在社会主义建设中所获得的巨大成就使所有人都感到惊异，这证明了伟大的、天才的中国人民具有无穷无尽的创造能力，证明了他们在他们光荣的共产党和他们的民主政府周围的钢铁般的团结，证明了社会主义制度的革命改造力量。
    中国是占世界人口四分之一、比美国人口多三倍的这样一个社会主义强国，它在国际上所具有的特殊地位使得任何重大国际问题没有中华人民共和国的参加都是不可能顺利解决的。尽管帝国主义者不喜欢这一现实，但是这是无可辩驳的事实。
    联合国中没有世界上人口最多的国家——人民中国，怎么能够说它是一个国际组织呢？没有中华人民共和国的参加，联合国怎么能够期望解决像裁军、禁止原子和核武器以及许多和平和国际合作的各项重大的国际问题呢？中国曾正式声明过，没有它的参加和它官方代表的签字，它将不受任何国际协议的约束。这是完全正确的。大家都可以理解的，只要联合国有蒋介石傀儡存在，而不代之以中华人民共和国的代表，那么中华人民共和国就不会参加任何联合国所组织的解决重大国际问题的会议。在这样情况下，联合国尽管可以通过多少的决议，但是这些决议只能是一纸空文，要使之实现，就必须有强大的中国的支持，必须有中华人民共和国参加。
    恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利问题，对于联合国的威信来说，一天比一天迫切和必须解决。但是美帝国主义及其盟国不择一切手段，力图阻挠恢复人民中国的合法权利。为此，他们对中华人民共和国制造了新的最下贱的诬蔑，把人民中国说成是“侵略”国，“不希望和平”，“希望战争”，如此等等。但是，美帝国主义者及其奴仆对中华人民共和国的一切“论据”是如此的愚蠢和毫无根据，美国政府驻联合国常任代表华兹沃斯先生这一次不得不动用帝国主义阴暗的诬蔑武库中的王牌——美帝国主义最忠诚的危险的奴仆南斯拉夫修正主义者吞吞吐吐的“论据”。
    华兹沃斯今年10月8日在联大逐字逐句引用铁托的话说：“中国领导人对我们的外交政策（即不同制度国家和人民间共处的政策）进行攻击，这也是有趣的。同志们，问题的所在就是这些人不喜欢我们的和平政策（即共处的政策）。但战争解决不了六亿人民国家的建成社会主义所遇到的困难。事实是，这个国家的人民喜欢这样一个说法：即在可能发生战争和类似的冲突时，他们仍将留有三亿人。意思就是说，将有三亿人遭到死亡，三亿人将受到拯救。但留下的不是别人，只是他们自己而已。”华兹沃斯还说：“这是引自南斯拉夫铁托元帅1958年6月15日的演说。确实现在对中国共产党人已很清楚了……”
    华兹沃斯这样说，同志们请看吧，事情被引到了什么地方去了！当然，当修正主义元帅听到他1958年在南斯拉夫对中国所说的话在1960年通过他的主子——美国人华兹沃斯的嘴在联合国来重述的时候，是会震惊的。但另一方面，这将被作为“有力论据”，以便从美帝国主义那里索取更多美元来建设“特殊社会主义”，反对国际共产主义。
    在最近这个时期，南斯拉夫修正主义者力图从“理论上”来“论证”美帝国主义关于人民中国“不喜欢和平而是主张战争”的论调，这完全不是偶然的。为此目的，出版了修正主义头目卡德尔写的极其狂妄的名为“社会主义与战争”一书。在这本书内，他对中华人民共和国进行了最下流的臆想的诬蔑，说中国共产党是“教条主义”的党，说中华人民共和国是“侵略”国，“不主张和平，不主张和平共处”，而是“主张原子战争”等等。一切机会主义者和现代修正主义者对修正主义头目卡德尔的理论随声附和，甚至和修正主义相互“竞赛”。谁对中华人民共和国诬蔑得更多，谁就把这种臆想的诬蔑更多更快地升化为“理论”，这完全不是偶然的。这证明中华人民共和国站在正确的道路上，站在马克思列宁主义的道路上。谢胡说，我们党、政府和人民以有中华人民共和国这样一个盟国而自豪。它正在伟大的英雄的中国共产党及其以不屈不挠的马克思列宁主义的战士、中国人民的伟大儿子毛泽东同志为首的列宁主义的中央委员会光荣的领导下，走向社会主义和共产主义。
      中国站在保卫世界和平斗争的最前线
    对制定和平共处原则作出了宝贵贡献
    同美帝国主义及其修正主义仆从的无耻诬蔑完全相反，中华人民共和国站在保卫世界和平、争取和平共处原则胜利的斗争的最前线。中华人民共和国是远东和世界和平的巨大因素，所有的人都知道它对朝鲜、越南停战协定的巨大贡献，它单方面地从朝鲜撤出了自己的志愿军，而今天，美国在南朝鲜还仍然保持着他们的军队，使其成为远东原子侵略的危险策源地。大家也都知道中华人民共和国在制定不同社会制度国家和平共处原则方面的宝贵贡献以及它对万隆会议的贡献，等等。
    中华人民共和国正在不断扩大和加强同其他国家的友好关系和贸易、文化联系。今天，它已同三十五个国家建立了外交关系，几乎同九十个国家进行贸易，并且同世界极大多数国家地区有着文化联系。中华人民共和国根据致力于加强和平和各国之间的合作的精神，不断地加强了同邻国的友好关系。过去和现在都支持苏联关于裁军的正确建议，并且自己也作出了消除战争危险和加强国际和平合作的重大创议。在这方面具有特别意义的是，周恩来同志关于缔结亚洲国家，特别是太平洋沿岸各国之间包括美国在内的互不侵犯和平公约，并使该地区变为无核武器地区的建议，这证明了中华人民共和国执行和平政策。这一真相是帝国主义者的非难和愚蠢的诬蔑以及他们的修正主义仆从“特殊”“理论”所贬低不了的。
    帝国主义者为了使美军对台湾和其他岛屿的侵占永久化，还捏造了所谓“两个中国”的理论。中国人民和我国人民都拒绝这种“理论”。台湾和周围的岛屿是中国的领土，是属于中国的。我们坚决支持中华人民共和国解放这些岛屿的权利，并认为这是人民中国的内政。
    今年恢复中国在联合国合法权利问题的投票结果，证明中华人民共和国的国际威望不断提高。
    我们深信，中华人民共和国进入联合国，并赶走蒋介石傀儡的日子不远了；我们同样相信，也总有一天，台湾和周围其他岛屿也将解放和回到伟大人民中国的怀抱。
    我们相信，联合国对人民中国的需要甚于人民中国对联合国的需要，所以，有一天会由联合国自己来请人民中国占有它在这个组织中的席位。因为帝国主义总不能把自己的意志永远强加在联合国头上。
    我们代表团在十五届联大上也要求联合国接纳蒙古为联合国会员国。
    谢胡说，十五届联大会议的特点是：国际关系中两条绝然相反的路线的斗争，即以苏联为首的社会主义各国和其他许多爱好和平国家所一贯遵循的和平路线同以美帝国主义国家所奉行的战争路线之间的尖锐斗争。
    社会主义国家和许多中立国家爱好和平
    但是必须时刻准备给侵略者以致命打击
    在总的路线方面，在当前国际生活最重大的问题上，社会主义国家的立场同站在反帝国主义的立场上并切身地关心保卫和巩固和平的许多中立国家的立场是一致的。不断加强社会主义阵营国家同中立国家，如印度、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国、加纳、几内亚等国家之间的友谊和在当前国际政治上最重要的问题上的合作，对巩固世界和平是一个十分重要的因素。
    试问：国际形势发展的前景如何？国际紧张局势是否能再度缓和？我们认为，目前国际紧张局势的加剧是暂时的现象，我们相信国际紧张关系中的再度缓和的日子将会到来，我们这样说不是我们对帝国主义存有幻想，而是以国际力量对比为依据的，只有和平力量才能迫使帝国主义缓和国际紧张局势。今天，存在着足以阻止帝国主义加剧冷战活动的和平力量，甚至这种力量足以，并且已有现实的可能性来制止新世界大战的爆发。
    我们现实的乐观主义的依据首先在于：社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结力量和这个阵营对主张反对新的世界大战、保障世界和平的世界各国爱好和平人民所具有的吸引力；另一方面，我们的依据是在于这样一个事实：帝国主义的全面削弱和全面腐烂，使它正越发变得摇摇欲坠。同时，对帝国主义者的图谋和活动必须保持最大的警惕，时刻准备着给每一个侵略者以致命的打击。正如共产党和工人党的莫斯科宣言所强调指出的：“只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤。”
    我们完全相信共产党和工人党的莫斯科宣言在谈到当代保卫和平事业的强大力量后所指出的这一论点是正确的：“这些强大力量的联合，可以阻止战争的爆发。如果帝国主义的战争狂人硬要不顾一切发动战争，那么帝国主义就注定灭亡，因为人民绝不会再继续容忍那个给他们带来如此惨重的痛苦和牺牲的制度。”
    铁托扮演着为帝国主义者效劳的卑鄙角色
    必须始终不渝地同现代修正主义进行斗争
    在谈到南斯拉夫代表团在联合国的活动时，谢胡说，参加这届联大的还有率领南斯拉夫代表团的铁托总统，铁托在纽约的特点是：他加紧进行组织“第三阵营”的活动，具体地说，就是企图使中立国家离开它们对社会主义国家的同情，使它们像他本人一样地效劳于帝国主义。据我们看来，铁托的演说是心怀叵测的蛊惑性演说。铁托的演说和他关于裁军、“反对”殖民主义和关于战争危险等等的蛊惑性言论只能欺骗天真的人和傻瓜，他没有说出任何一句反对帝国主义的话，他一次也没有具体提到过是谁在剥削殖民地人民，没有说出任何一句揭露美帝国主义的话，声名狼借的忠实仆从怎么能说出反对自己主子的话呢？当美国的华兹沃斯在也有铁托在场的联大引用铁托反对人民中国的演说（看，铁托是多么的“忠诚”！）作为反对人民中国的主要“论据”的时候，南斯拉夫代表团投票赞成接纳人民中国为联合国会员国究竟又有什么意义呢！美国政府为了“提高”铁托作为一个危险的“共产党人”的身份，在铁托的官邸前面组织了几次“示威”，为了继续扮演国务院制造的这一滑稽剧，南斯拉夫外交国务秘书波波维奇甚至在联大对“示威”提出了口头抗议，这一切都是制造出来的荒诞言行，是为了使铁托在人们的心目中，特别是在中立者的心目中描绘成是一个反帝国主义者。但是，筛子是遮不住太阳的，那些稍微有头脑的人都懂得，铁托在这次所扮演的角色如同一贯所表现的那样，仍然是卑鄙的。
    我们党对修正主义者的立场一贯是并且将永远是坚定的。铁托这次在纽约逗留使我们更加相信，在进行反对帝国主义和保障世界和平的斗争的同时，如果不在意识形态上同现代修正主义进行始终不渝斗争，不在各国人民面前把它作为为帝国主义服务的危险间谍来加以揭露的话，那么要取得圆满的成功，是不可能的。这样的斗争和揭露就不仅不会像某些人所幻想的那样，提高修正主义者的威信，而将在意识形态上打破这一威信。铁托去纽约的主要目的之一正是在于提高他的威信，他特别致力于用幕后接触这种手段来达到这个目的。
  阿尔巴尼亚人民一手拿镐一手拿枪进行建设
  光荣的劳动党不屈不挠忠于马克思列宁主义
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府一贯遵循以众所周知的和平共处原则为基础的和平外交政策，我们对外政策的基石一贯是，并将永远是我国人民同苏联各族人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，是我国人民同伟大的中国人民以及社会主义阵营其他各国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊。
    我们一贯并将永远致力于对我们的邻国执行睦邻的政策。
    我们愿意根据和平共处的原则同任何一个国家建立外交关系，只要它们也有同样的愿望。当然有一个条件，即任何一方不应对另一方有领土或政治要求。
    十五届联大会议再次地证明了我们党一贯的总路线是多么地正确，党教导我国人民在为建设社会主义而奋斗的时候，要一手拿镐、一手拿枪，在任何时候都不要丧失对帝国主义的侵略目的和活动、对最危险的帝国主义间谍——现代修正主义的活动的敏锐的革命警惕性。
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚人民的自由不是伸手向人求来的，而是手拿着武器用斗争从敌人那儿夺来的。我国人民热爱和平，我们坚决争取和平。但是如果外部敌人胆敢在那一天侵犯我们，那么他们应该知道这里居住着的人民是宁可在光荣斗争中站着死，而不愿当亡国奴跪着生，我们有相当的经验并且懂得怎样来把我们的自由一直保卫到底，甚至在必要的时候用血和生命来换取。我们党建设社会主义和保卫人民自由的总路线的胜利的保证是我国人民高度的社会主义的爱国主义，是在以霍查同志为首的列宁主义的中央委员会英明坚决领导下的我们光荣的党的不屈不挠的对马克思列宁主义始终如一的、忠实到底的领导，是我国人民同苏联各族人民以及社会主义阵营其他各国人民的牢不可破的永恒的友谊。
    谢胡最后说，在我国很快就将召开我们劳动党的第四次代表大会，这次代表大会对我们党和人民有着历史性的特别意义。不久以前发表了我国在建设社会主义社会道路上的发展经济和文化的第三个五年计划的指示草案，它为我国打开了光辉的远景，但同时对计划的执行要求我国人民全面地动员起全部的力量。
    我们政府将像以往那样遵循党所制定的总路线，动员一切的力量来光荣地完成人民和党所交予的崇高任务。
    我们光荣的党及其以我们党的创始者——恩维尔·霍查同志为首的列宁主义的中央委员会万岁！我们英雄的勤劳的爱好和平的人民万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平的坚不可摧的堡垒——强大的社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结万岁！世界和平万岁！（文内插题是本报编者所加）
