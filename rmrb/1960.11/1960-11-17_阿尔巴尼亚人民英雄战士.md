    On October 28, the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania awarded medals and decorations to the crew of the steamer "Ali Kelmendi" to reward them for resolutely defending the Party's line and the glory of the Albanian people, despite the threats of the Yugoslav revisionists.
    On October 17, while sailing on the high seas, these crew members were attacked by a storm and were forced to enter the port of Gruz in Yugoslavia to take shelter. The Yugoslav port personnel used despicable threats and intimidation to force them to remove an article from the steamer's wall newspaper that exposed Yugoslav modern revisionism. The crew members, despite facing the danger of sinking, resolutely rejected this provocative demand by the Yugoslav revisionists and firmly declared that not only would they not remove the article, but not a single word in the article could be changed.
    After threats and intimidation proved ineffective, the Yugoslav authorities, in violation of international maritime law, refused to allow the steamer to take shelter from the storm. Finally, the crew members resolutely braved the raging waves and danger, left the port and sailed into the high seas. After many difficulties, they finally returned safely to the Albanian port of Durres on the 18th. (Picture attached)

    阿尔巴尼亚人民英雄战士
    十月二十八日，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团授予“阿里·卡尔门迪号”汽船的船员以勋章和奖章，奖励他们不顾南斯拉夫修正主义者的威胁，坚决保卫党的路线和阿尔巴尼亚人民的光荣。
    这些船员十月十七日在公海上航行时受到了暴风雨的袭击，曾被迫开进南斯拉夫的格鲁日港口避风。南斯拉夫港口人员使用了卑鄙的威胁和恐吓手法，硬要他们拿掉汽船墙报上的一篇揭露南斯拉夫现代修正主义的文章。船员们虽然面临沉没的危险，坚决地拒绝了南斯拉夫修正主义者这一挑衅性要求，并坚决声明，不仅不拿掉这篇文章，而且文章中任何一个字也不能改动。
    在威胁和恐吓无效后，南斯拉夫当局竟违反国际航海公法，拒绝让这艘汽船避风。最后，船员们毅然冒着骇浪和危险，离港驶向公海，经过重重的困难，终于在十八日安全地返回阿尔巴尼亚都拉斯港。（附图片）
