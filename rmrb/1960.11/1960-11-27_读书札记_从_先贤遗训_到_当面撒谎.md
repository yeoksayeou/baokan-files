    Reading Notes
    From "Sage's Precepts" to "Lying to One's Face"
    A Ying
    Not long after the end of the Opium War, an American wrote several letters to the Chinese Imperial Commissioner stationed in Guangdong, requesting to go to Beijing to "study and serve" in the field of astronomy. He also stated that the United States "dares not" follow Britain's approach to China because "American sages left precepts, not to send troops to other countries, nor to occupy other countries' land." A "kind-hearted" staff member who read this letter, although somewhat doubtful about this statement, still thought that "there seems to be no need to worry about them seeking another pretext to reopen border disputes." What he could be sure of was that the American had "come to China from tens of thousands of miles across the ocean, which is both laborious and costly; if his request is not granted, he may not be willing to turn back immediately." He did not expect that the people of Guangdong at that time had the strength to make them "turn back."
    Another letter drafted by this staff member in reply to the American revealed that the American was not really accepting the "sage's precepts," but was using the "sage's precepts" as a smokescreen to conceal his hideous face. Like the British, French, and other imperialists, the American imperialists quickly gained a foothold in China to interfere in China's internal affairs, and even used threats of war with China to intimidate China. This "kind-hearted" staff member did not see this and still wanted to "convince with reason," saying to the American: "China has its own system, and each country has its own system. China cannot change its system to suit other countries simply because it is friendly with other countries, just as other countries cannot change their system to suit China simply because they are friendly with China." However, in terms of military intimidation, he clearly saw the weakness that the American could not overcome: "The United States has no dispute with China, and is separated by tens of thousands of miles across the ocean. Language is not understood, customs are different. If they get the land, they cannot defend it; if they get the people, they cannot govern them. Both countries have people who are good at predicting things. How can there be a reason to use troops for no reason?" That is to say, war is not easy to fight, and the Chinese people are unconquerable.
    Despite what he said, the American did not care about this. Their "long voyage" was, as the "kind-hearted" staff member said: "In the name of visiting the superior country, but in fact boasting about the British barbarians, and there are also French people here spying on the situation, wanting to follow suit," was to compete with the British, French, and other imperialists for China, and to "share the benefits equally." They, both contradictory and unified, both separate and united, "used excuses to create incidents" and attacked China. From another "draft," it can be seen that the imperialists once proposed to China: "For example, if a person has a house, and one room is occupied by a thief who cannot be driven away, and a friend wants to borrow a room, but is refused, it would be a miscalculation." That is, they used the precedent to demand what they wanted and then questioned when not fulfilled, while calling themselves "friends." Therefore, the staff member's reply was: "I believe that if a house is occupied by a thief, the only thing a friend should do is to help the owner catch the thief and return the house to the owner, which is the behavior of a good friend. If he also wants to take the opportunity to occupy a room, he is taking advantage of the owner's danger and using the thief as an example, which is not the way of a gentleman." The American was such a thief who "used the thief as an example," and "surpassed his predecessors" by signing the "Treaty of Wangxia" with the Qing government.
    This is a side of the early American imperialist aggression against China seen in Huang Entong's "Zhizhitang Wenji," volume 31. Chen Yin's "Lianmu Ji" has a line: "Together we protect the global peaceful situation, but what does their talk of public law really mean?" From the American's initial "sage's precepts" to Acheson's "lying to one's face," their hypocrisy, deception, and aggressive nature are truly "inherited in one continuous line."

### 读书札记  从“先贤遗训”到“当面撒谎”

    读书札记
    从“先贤遗训”到“当面撒谎”
    阿英
    鸦片战争结束不久，有一个美国佬写了好几封信给驻在广东的中国钦差大臣，要求进京在天文方面
  “学习当差”。并说美国“不敢”效英国对中国的做法，因为“美国先贤，曾留遗训，不加兵他国，不占据他国土地”。读到这封信的一位“好心肠的”幕府先生，虽说对这样说法多少也有些怀疑，总还以为
  “似另索马头，重启边衅之处，尚可无虑”。他所能肯定的，就是美国佬“已越十万里重洋远来中国，既劳且费，若求无一遂，未必遽肯回帆耳”。他没有想到，当时的广东人民，就有力量打得他们“回帆”。
    从这位幕府先生拟稿直复美国佬的另一封信里，却透露了美国佬并不是真的接受“先贤遗训”，而是用“先贤遗训”的幌子，来遮盖掩藏自己的狰狞面目。美帝国主义者和英、法其他帝国主义者一样，很快就在中国插进了脚，来干涉中国内政，还用不惜和中国开仗一类的话吓唬中国。这位“好心肠的”幕府先生看不到这些，还想“以理服人”，向美国佬说什么：“中国有中国之制度，各国有各国之制度，中国不能因与各国和好，即改制度而就各国，亦如各国不能因与中国和好，即改制度而就中国也。”不过，在军事恫吓方面，他却看清了美国佬没有办法克服的弱点：“合众国与中国毫无衅隙，且远隔十万里重洋，言语不通，风俗各别，得其地不能守，得其民不能治，两国均不乏明于料事之人，岂有无端用兵之理？”就是说，仗不是好打的，中国人民是不可征服的。
    话尽管这么说，美国佬是不管你这一套的。他们的“远涉重洋”，正和这位“好心肠的”幕府先生所说：“名为参观上国，实则夸耀英夷，而法兰西亦有人在此窥探动静，欲行踵效”，是为着和英、法其他帝国主义者进行争夺中国来的，是为着要“利益均沾”来的。他们既矛盾又统一，既各别又联合的“借口生端”，向中国进攻。从再一篇“拟稿”里可以看出，帝国主义者曾经向中国提出：“譬如人有屋一所，被贼占据一间，不能逐去，而朋友借居，则勒而勿予，未免失算”，就是援例要求不遂，就进行诘责，还自称是“朋友”。所以幕府先生拟的答复是：“不佞则谓屋被贼占，为朋友者，惟有助主擒贼，以屋还主，方为良友耳。若亦欲乘势占屋一间，是幸主之危，援贼为例，大非君子之道也”。美国佬就是这样贼“援贼为例”，“青出于蓝”和清廷订了“望厦条约”的。
    这是从黄恩彤《知止堂文集》三十一卷本所看到的美帝国主义侵略中国初期的一个侧面。陈寅《莲幕集》有句云：“共保全球太平局，口谈公法意如何？”从美国佬初期的“先贤遗训”，一直到艾奇逊的“当面撒谎”，虚伪欺骗和侵略本质，真是“一脉相传”。
