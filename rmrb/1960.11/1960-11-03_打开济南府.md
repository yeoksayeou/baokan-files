    Opening Jinan Prefecture
    Zhou Zhijian

    I.
    In July 1948, after the victory of the Yanzhou Campaign, our field headquarters held a meeting of senior cadres in the city of Qufu, where the battle plan for attacking Jinan was determined. At that time, the main force of the East China Field Army had come north from Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu, and northern Jiangsu. Our column was ordered to transfer to the Laiwu area to prepare for the siege.
    When the commanders and fighters heard that they were going to carry out a major mission, they were all in high spirits. The entire column immediately launched a large-scale training upsurge for siege warfare. Whether it was night exercises for climbing city walls or mountains, or daytime exercises for attacking fortifications in the field, nothing stopped them. The soldiers all said, grinding their fists: "We will make the enemies in Jinan City bow their heads before us!"
    Not long after, Deputy Commander Wang Jian'an of the East Corps called me, and he said excitedly: "Old Zhou, I have good news for you. Commissar Tan (Zhenlin) is back, and Commander Xu (Shiyou) has also returned from recuperating in Jiaodong. According to the spirit of the Qufu meeting, it has been decided to attack Jinan first..."
    What a brilliant decision! I thought to myself, if the bandit Fifth Army wanted to come to the rescue from the north, the main force of the East China Field Army would wipe them out in one fell swoop. If they didn't come, we would concentrate our strength to eliminate the Wang Yaowu Group. Once the Jinan nail was pulled out, the Shandong and North China liberated areas would be connected, and our army could drive south without any worries.
    On September 7, the corps ordered our column to assemble in the southwest area of Jinan to await orders. We immediately held a meeting to determine the combat tasks of each division: the 39th Division to clear the periphery, and the 37th and 38th Divisions to attack the city.
    The day before the attack, Commissar Liao Haiguang and I, along with cadres from each division and regiment and personnel from the column headquarters, went to observe the terrain in the Jinan periphery where our column would attack. Along the way, we saw stretcher teams and grain delivery teams supporting the troops coming and going, and the villagers were all smiling and full of energy. The guide said to me excitedly: "Comrade, it's really different than before!"
    I laughed and said: "This is the great counter-offensive!"
    When the villagers saw the car, they all laughed and said:
    "Our Eighth Route Army is not rustic after all, taking this 'business' to fight!"
    We greeted them with a smile:
      "Villagers, you're working hard!"
    "Not at all, we are cooperating between the army and the people: open Jinan Prefecture, and capture Wang Yaowu alive!" Then there was a burst of hearty and proud laughter.
    As our car drove through the ranks, we saw an endless stream of people behind us. Commissar said with emotion: "Look, the people of Shandong have all come to fight Jinan! I heard that 200,000 civilian workers have come from the central and southern Shandong region alone, and the people of Jiaodong have organized a support team of 60,000 people; the women in the Binhai area work in the fields during the day and grind flour at night to support the front. Everyone has the same goal, to capture Jinan."
      "Such a force is invincible!" I was also deeply moved by the enthusiastic support of the people of Shandong.
    The next day, we climbed Yuanbai Mountain. It was very close to Jinan, but the line of sight was blocked by the steep cliffs of Zhengmao Mountain and Mawu Village in front of us, so we couldn't get a panoramic view of the city. However, the smooth runway on the airfield to the west, the fortifications on the villages and mountain tops, and the steep cliffs of the Thousand Buddha Mountain to the east were all clearly visible.
    Jinan has a population of about 700,000. It is located north of the Yellow River and south of Mount Tai, with a strategic terrain that is easy to defend and difficult to attack. Relying on this favorable terrain, Wang Yaowu defended it with 100,000 heavily armed troops, and built countless steel and concrete fortifications in a depth of more than 100 miles around it, from Luankou Bridge on the Yellow River in the north to Lasha Mountain and Qinglong Mountain in the south, and from Huangtai in the east to the airfield in the west. He also built solid fortresses in the urban area - the commercial port, the outer city, and the inner city, attempting to hold out. He never expected that most of the East China Field Army would be deployed north of Xuzhou and along the southwestern Shandong front, forming an iron Great Wall to block any enemy that might come to the rescue from Xuzhou; and that another six columns would form the east and west siege corps, just like a pair of large pincers, tightly clamping down on Jinan City...

    II.
    On the evening of September 16, the column headquarters seemed particularly busy. The telephone rang urgently, and the telegraph machine made a "tick-tock" sound. Tense and serious expressions before the battle appeared on the faces of every comrade. I stood in front of the Jinan city map, watching the enemy's outer strongholds that were about to be removed, and at the same time thinking that Commanders Chen and Su were also setting a large net in the area of ​​100 miles between Yanzhou and Jinan, waiting for the enemy to come to the rescue from the north.... The joy of victory surged through my heart in waves.
    At exactly 24:00, the telephone rang heart-shakingly, the corps issued an order:
      "Begin!"
    I excitedly picked up the telephone and ordered the 39th Division Commander: "Attack Jiashanpo, Shifangyu!"
    In an instant, the battle to liberate Jinan began. Cannons roared from all directions, red lights flashed everywhere, and the heavy explosions shook the mountains and the ground...
    The fighting went smoothly all night. The 39th Division won one victory after another. Only Mawu Village was difficult to capture. The enemy had buried countless landmines around it, all controlled by electric wires. As soon as our troops approached, the enemy detonated the landmines, and the troops suffered continuous casualties. We failed to capture it after several attacks. After receiving this report, I ordered the 39th Division to bombard it with artillery, and instructed the 37th Division to cooperate with the 39th Division to clear the periphery. The enemy, surrounded and isolated, attempted to escape, but was finally annihilated by our army at the foot of the mountain east of Mawu Village.
    On the morning of the second day of the battle, the corps headquarters suddenly called and said:
    "The Wu Huawen unit may revolt tonight, you should be prepared to insert into the commercial port while they retreat!"
    Wu Huawen's uprising was very beneficial to us. I excitedly turned to the map, pointed to the airfield commercial port, and said to the Commissar: "This is great! Wu Huawen has opened Wang Yaowu's door here. We must take the opportunity to attack fiercely and not let the enemy close the door!" The Commissar nodded with a smile, and immediately personally notified the 37th Division to prepare to advance, and ordered the 39th Division to use the name and password of the Wu Huawen unit to take advantage of the chaos to capture East Baima Mountain, Qinglong Mountain, and advance towards the city with the 37th Division.
    Time passed minute by minute, and as the sun slowly set in the west, there was still no sign of Wu Huawen's uprising. While we were still in doubt, we received a call from the corps: "Wu's unit will concentrate west of the airfield after dusk, you must act quickly!" I grabbed the telephone and said to Gao Rui, the commander of the 37th Division: "According to the original plan, insert into the commercial port!"
    At this time, everyone excitedly climbed to the top of the mountain and observed with binoculars. We saw that our troops had already poured forward in several columns. After a while, our vanguard troops had already inserted into Longwo, and happened to encounter an enemy field artillery battalion. Although under Wu Huawen's command, they refused to obey orders and resisted the uprising, shouting and screaming and fleeing in a panic to the city. In order not to alarm the enemy, we did not attack them.
    One night passed.
    At dawn, we received a report from Commander Gao: During the advance, they occupied East Baima Mountain and the unnamed high ground to the north, and the areas of Xixingzhuang and Xinzhuangying had been occupied. The enemy on Qinglong Mountain was retreating to Ma'an Mountain in a chaotic manner. As the enemy ran, we chased, almost mixed together.
    In the afternoon, Commander Gao excitedly said on the phone again: "The comrades of the Third Column have come up, and we have made contact with its left wing..." This was really good news. I pointed to the map and said to the Commissar: "Look, it's developing so fast! We have now entered the gate of the commercial port!"
    At the same time, the outer strongholds attacked by our column had been basically cleared, leaving only the isolated Ma'an Mountain and Zhengmao Mountain, still in the hands of the enemy, but tightly surrounded by us.

    III.
    The column headquarters quickly moved to Pipa Mountain south of Xinzhuang. It was only two li away from the commercial port, and the outline of the city was clearly visible in front of us.
    After reporting our new deployment to Commander Xu of the corps, we decided to seize the commercial port that night and cooperate with the Ninth Column in attacking the outer city.
    Before dusk, Commander Gao suddenly called: "The enemy in the commercial port is coming and going, not like they are counterattacking, there may be a new deployment." Just then, we received another report from the 37th Division: "The enemy is transferring defenses." I immediately ordered them: "Take action, attack quickly!"
    Along with the rumbling of cannons and explosions, good news came. Commander Gao shouted on the phone: "Catch the enemy off guard, the Dahuaishu and Kazimen have been blasted open, and the troops are developing inwards... The Third Column and the Lu Column are requesting to enter from here!" "Great, please let them in quickly!" I said excitedly.
    From the map, we seemed to see the three armies marching mightily into the commercial port, reaching Wang Yaowu's "Pacification Public Office," the warriors compressed forward vigorously, fighting for every house, chasing, and annihilating the enemy.
    After a night of fierce fighting, the 37th Division arrived at the Yongsui Gate of the outer city. At this time, the fraternal units, the Third Column and part of the Lu Column, also arrived outside the Puli Gate and Linxiang Gate.
    At dawn, the troops were busy preparing to attack the city. The column headquarters then moved forward to the village on the unnamed high ground west of East Baima Mountain. We immediately made a new deployment for the attack. The 37th Division was to mainly attack the outer city, break through from both sides of the Yongsui Gate, and attack the Kunshun Gate in the inner city. The 38th Division was to send a regiment to cooperate, cross the outer city and attack the southeast of the Kunshun Gate, and meet up with the Ninth Column.
    We reported the deployment to Commander Xu, and Commander Xu said repeatedly: "Good, good, attack the city tonight, hit the vital points hard!"
    In the afternoon, the Commissar and I went to the 37th Division to observe the terrain and the situation of the troops. As we walked out of the headquarters, the sky gradually darkened, and only the clouds in the sky were still painted with a layer of red. We passed a tall building where the steel and concrete building had been destroyed by artillery fire, leaving only the black frame, and the raging fire was still burning; the dilapidated bunkers, windows, stairs, and roads were covered with enemy corpses. It turned out that this was the location of Wang Yaowu's "Pacification Public Office" headquarters. After days of fierce fighting, the enemy had been pushed into the inner city, and the encirclement of the city gates was becoming tighter and tighter. Wang Yaowu's fate of being annihilated was already unavoidable.

    After dusk, the fierce battle to climb the city began. After several hours of fighting, the 37th Division and the 38th Division simultaneously reported: Both Yongsui Gate and Ganshiqiao had been breached, and they were rapidly approaching the inner city. At dawn, they reached the area south of the Kunshun Gate in the inner city and west of Yingfang Street, approaching the city wall. The 38th Division also successfully met up with the Ninth Column at the South Gate, and joined hands to prepare for the attack on the inner city.
    At this point, the inner city was tightly clamped.

    IV.
    After receiving this report, Commander Xu replied happily:
    "Very good, cooperate with the Ninth Column in attacking the inner city tonight, continue to give the enemy a fierce blow, and catch them off guard."
    The troops had been fighting continuously, and the soldiers were very tired. In addition, there were some casualties, so they needed to be reorganized. Moreover, the inner city was more difficult to attack than the outer city. The troops had to cooperate with the Ninth Column in attacking the inner city that night, which was indeed difficult. But the problem was also very clear. In order not to give the enemy a moment to breathe, they had to fight continuously, and the superior's determination could not be shaken. The Commissar and I then went down to mobilize the troops, preparing to take the inner city in one fell swoop, wipe out the last enemy, and capture Wang Yaowu alive. The soldiers all expressed heroically: No problem.
    In order to open the last barrier - the inner city, the troops prepared nervously.
    At sixteen o'clock on the fifth evening of the battle, we launched an attack on the inner city. The inner city was the enemy's last stronghold. The city wall was more than three zhang high and eight meters thick, entirely built of large stone strips, steep and dangerous, with bunkers densely packed under the wall, and several layers of loopholes on the wall. The moat was wide and deep, and defending the inner city were Wang Yaowu's direct line elite troops. Wang Yaowu was a so-called famous general of the Kuomintang, a powerful figure and local tyrant in Shandong. He never used his own direct line troops. During the Laiwu campaign, he watched Li Xianzhou being captured alive by our army and did not go to rescue him, keeping his troops and vainly trying to defend Jinan to the death.
    The battle became more and more intense, and heavy explosions came one after another. The soldiers were trying to climb the city with large bamboo poles, fighting for a breakthrough.
    At two o'clock in the morning, Commander Gao reported to me nervously and excitedly:
    "The city wall was blasted a round hole for the first time, but we couldn't get in; the city wall was blasted a crack for the second time, but we couldn't climb up even with ladders; this time, the troops that rushed up are piled up on the city wall and can't move to both sides. Only Comrade Huang Xinhe led part of a battalion and went down the city to advance to the side of the column..."
    At the same time, the corps headquarters told us that the Ninth Column had broken into the inner city, and we had to attack quickly, which made me both happy and nervous.
    After a while, Commander Gao called again and said: "We are fighting fiercely for the breakthrough, with heavy casualties, and the Kunshun Gate has still not been breached."
      "The big brother has entered, don't fall behind, resolutely fight in!"
      "Okay, we will definitely fight in!" The words were interrupted by the sound of artillery!
    The east gradually turned white, then red, and the round sun showed a little face. The battle for the city head was still going on fiercely. At this time, Commander Gao said anxiously on the phone:
    "The breakthrough was taken away by Wang Yaowu's special agent regiment, and the troops that went down the city were cut off..."
    "What? Taken away? Fight resolutely, regardless of any sacrifice!"
    The situation was serious. If we couldn't break through, it would increase the difficulties for the fraternal columns. I immediately reported to Commander Xu, who said calmly:
      "It doesn't matter, organize and continue to attack, I will immediately ask the Ninth Column to meet up with you in the west!"...
    The situation was still not good. Commander Gao reported to me again: "The First and Third Battalions attacked from both sides of the Kunshun Gate and were blocked by the enemy's fierce firepower; the Third Battalion Commander, Comrade Liu Kun, led the entire battalion to storm up and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, and was seriously injured, details unknown..."
      "Continue to fight! Tell the regimental commander to lead the fight! If you can't attack, then call the 38th Division to continue the attack. You must attack, I will immediately call the howitzer regiment to support you..." I replied anxiously.
    The fierce battle for the city head had reached a white-hot level. The soldiers were risking their lives and climbing towards the city head in the enemy's fire net that looked down from above. When the sun rose a zhang high, Commander Gao shouted on the phone:
      "It's been smashed open, we've broken through, our two regiments are pouring in!..."
    I finally breathed a sigh of relief. Afterwards, I learned how fierce the battle for the city head was: Battalion Commander Liu Kun sacrificed himself, and the troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy on the city wall. In the end, only one squad was left, but they did not retreat an inch. Finally, Wang, the squad leader of the Ninth Company, was the only one left. This burly, short, dark-skinned squad leader, like an immovable and invincible Mount Tai, guarded the breakthrough, grabbed two boxes of enemy hand grenades, and threw them fiercely to the left and right. The enemy shouted: "Surrender!" He said: "Okay, I'm out of bullets, you come here, I have sweet potatoes and peanuts here..." As a result, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, and the breakthrough was still under Squad Leader Wang's feet. His bravery reduced the casualties of the troops, and his bravery bought time for the troops to quickly annihilate the enemy. At the post-war hero and model conference, I went to find this squad leader with respect and asked him:
      "Why didn't you retreat at that time?"
    He said: "We stormed up here, and so many comrades sacrificed to occupy this gap. If I retreat, how much blood will the comrades behind me have to pay to storm up again! Besides, part of the troops that have already broken into the city are about to be cut off by the enemy, how can I retreat?..."
    Look, this is the thought of one of our ordinary soldiers!
    Comrade Huang Xinhe, who rushed down the city, only cared about rushing forward. When they found that the city head was full of enemies, they locked the prisoners they had caught in the house and said: "Anyone who comes out will die!" After organizing the only squad left, they charged left and right to force the breach, and attacked the enemy fiercely from behind. The enemy was caught off guard for a while, and panicked and retreated to both sides. Huang Xinhe led a squad of men and met up with Squad Leader Wang. Because of their bravery and tenacity, they occupied the breach, allowing the follow-up troops to quickly break into the inner city.

    V.
    The inner city was broken, and Wang Yaowu's tortoise shell was opened!
    At this time, Commander Xu called and asked: "How is it going!" I gave him a brief report, and he said excitedly:
    "Good, good! You must quickly meet up with the Ninth Column!"
    The moment to finally annihilate the enemy had finally arrived.
    But on the eve of this victory, bad news came: When the headquarters of the 37th Division was moving into the inner city, it was bombed by the enemy, and Commissar Xu Haishan sacrificed on the spot, Commander Gao was seriously injured under the rubble, and other comrades also sacrificed...
    I felt extremely uncomfortable. Victory was bought with the blood of the comrades, and every victory came at such a heavy price! I couldn't help but scold the enemy: "See how long you can be crazy, Wang Yaowu, your fate of being annihilated is right in front of you!"
    Just then, the corps headquarters issued an inspiring message that the inner city had been opened in many places by us, and the Third Column, Ninth Column, Lu Column, Bo Column, and my column were bravely converging on the Daming Lake and the enemy's provincial government. Although I was heavy-hearted, I was encouraged by this great victory. I left the map and walked out of the headquarters, standing on the high, unnamed high ground. I saw the inner city in a sea of ​​fire, with thick smoke billowing, and our army was completely annihilating the last enemy. Wang Yaowu's so-called elite troops no longer had any strength to resist our army's overwhelming offensive.
    The gunshots in the inner city died down, and the battle was coming to an end. Commander Xu of the 38th Division said on the phone with regret:
      "Wang Yaowu has run away, but his staff officer Luo Xinli has been captured!"
    "Run away? He can't escape!" I said coldly: "Wang Yaowu can escape from Jinan, but he can't escape from the liberated area even if he has wings. Every village and every person in the liberated area is waiting to capture him."
    This was the sixth day of dusk, and the sunset glow reddened the entire western sky, reddening the city of Jinan. Jinan Prefecture, defended by Wang Yaowu with 100,000 heavily armed troops, was liberated by our army. The hundreds of thousands of enemies in Xuzhou, led by the New Fifth Army, did not dare to enter the net laid by our field army, and could only watch in horror as the Wang Yaowu Group was wiped out.

    打开济南府
    周志坚
    一
    1948年7月，兖州战役胜利结束后，我野战司令部在曲阜城里召开了高级干部会议，确定了打济南的战役部署。当时，华东野战军主力已由豫皖苏、苏北等地纷纷北来，我们纵队奉命向莱芜地区转移，作攻坚准备。
    指战员们，听说又要执行重大任务，个个情绪昂扬，全纵立刻掀起了大规模攻坚战的练兵热潮，不论夜间演习登城、爬山，白天演习野外攻坚，风雨无阻。战士们个个磨拳擦掌地说：“要叫济南城的敌人在我们面前低下头来！”
    时隔不久，东兵团王建安副司令员给我来了电话，他兴奋地说：“老周，告诉你一个好消息，谭（震林）政委回来了，许（世友）司令员也从胶东休养回来啦，根据曲阜会议精神，决定先打济南。……”
    多英明的决定啊！我心里想，这一着，匪五军如要北援，华东野战军主力便一鼓作气，将其歼灭；如不来，我们就集中力量，消灭王耀武集团。济南这个钉子一拔掉，山东、华北解放区便联成一片，我军就可以长驱南下，无后顾之忧了。
    9月7日，兵团命令我们纵队向济南西南地区集结待命。我们立即召开会议，确定了各师作战任务：三九师扫清外围，三七师、三八师攻城。
    进攻的前一天，政委廖海光同志和我带着各师、团干部及纵队指挥所人员，去济南外围我纵攻击地区观察地形。沿途看到群众支援部队的担架队、送粮队往来穿梭，老乡们个个眉开眼笑，精神抖擞。向导兴奋地对我说：“同志啊，真不同以前了！”
    我笑道：“这是大反攻啦！”
    老乡们看见汽车，都笑哈哈地讲起来：
    “咱八路军到底不土气了，坐上这个‘买卖’去打仗啦！”
    我们笑着招呼说：
      “老乡们，你们受累了！”
    “哪里，咱们是军民合作：打开济南府，活捉王耀武！”接着是一阵粗壮和自豪的笑声。
    我们的车子从行列里开过，只见后面是一眼望不到头的人流。政委感慨地说：“看，山东人民都来打济南啦！听说，鲁中南一地就来了二十万民工，胶东人民组织了一支六万人的支前大队；滨海地区的妇女，白天下地干活，晚上磨面支援前方。人人都是一个心眼，打下济南。”
      “这样的力量是无坚不摧的！”我也深为山东人民的热情支援所感动。
    第二天，我们爬上元白山。这里距济南很近，但视线却被眼前的陡岩峭壁的郑茂山、马武寨挡住了，不能纵观全城。然而西边飞机场上的光滑跑道、村庄、山头上的工事，以及东边千佛山上险峻的群崖，都历历在目。
    济南人口约七十余万。北靠黄河，南依泰山，地形险要，易守难攻。王耀武凭借这有利地形，以十万重兵把守，并且又北起黄河滦口桥，南至腊山、青龙山，东起黄台，西至飞机场，在周围纵深百余里内，筑起无数钢骨水泥工事；又在市区——商埠、外城、内城构筑坚固的堡垒，妄图困守。他哪里料得到，我华东野战军大部分兵力分摆在徐州以北、鲁西南一线，组成一道铁的长城，阻击可能由徐州北援之敌；另以六个纵队组成东、西攻城兵团，正好似一把大箝，紧紧夹住了济南市。……
    二
    9月16日晚，纵队指挥所显得分外忙碌。电话铃急促地响着，电报机发出“嗒嗒”的响声。战前紧张、严肃的表情浮现在每个同志的脸上。我站在济南市区挂图前，注视着即将被拔除的敌人的外围据点，同时想到陈、粟司令员已在兖、济百余里地区，也张下大网，专待北援之敌……。胜利的欢悦，阵阵冲击着我的心头。
    二十四时整，电话铃震荡人心地响起来，兵团来了命令：
      “开始！”
    我激动地拿起电话机，命令三九师傅师长：“向甲山坡，石方峪攻击！”
    顷刻，解放济南的攻坚战打响了。大炮从四面八方轰鸣，到处红光闪耀，沉重的爆炸声，震动得山摇地动，……
    整夜战斗顺利，三九师连打连胜，只有马武寨，敌人在它周围埋设了无数地雷，全用电线操纵，当我部队一接近，敌人便拉响地雷，部队不断遭到伤亡，几攻未克。我得到这一报告后，就命令三九师用炮轰，并指示三七师以一部协同三九师扫清外围。敌人受围孤立，企图逃窜，终于被我军歼灭在马武寨东面的山下了。
    战斗到第二天上午，兵团司令部突然来电话说：
    “敌吴化文部今夜可能起义，你们做好准备，乘他撤退时，插进商埠！”
    吴化文起义，对我们很有利，我兴奋地转向挂图前，指着飞机场商埠，向政委说：“这太好啦！吴化文在这里把王耀武的大门拉开了，我们要乘机猛攻，不能让敌人把门关上！”政委含笑点头，随即亲自通知三七师做好前进准备，并命令三九师用吴化文部名义、口令，乘其混乱，夺取东白马山、青龙山和三七师齐头并进插向市区。
    时间一刻一刻地过去，眼看太阳慢慢向西落，还没有听到吴化文部起义的动静，我们正在怀疑，接到兵团的电话：“吴部黄昏后，向飞机场以西集中，你们快行动！”我随手抓起电话机，对三七师高锐师长说：“按原计划，向商埠插进！”
    这时，大家都兴奋地爬上山头，用望远镜观察，只见我们的部队已几路纵队朝前涌进，一会，我先头部队已插到龙窝，正好遇上敌人的一个野炮营，虽属吴化文指挥，却不服从调动，抗拒起义，人喊马叫慌慌张张地往市区逃窜。为了不惊动敌人，我们没有打它。
    一夜过去了。
    黎明，接到高师长报告：前进中攻占了东白马山及北面无名高地，现西行庄、辛庄营等处已被占领。青龙山之敌正混乱地向马安山撤退。敌人跑，我们追，几乎混在一起了。
    下午，高师长又在电话里兴奋地说：“三纵的同志上来了，我们已和它的左翼取上联系……。”这真是好消息，我指着地图对政委说：“你看，发展的好快呀！现已进到商埠的大门！”
    与此同时，我纵攻击的外围据点，已基本肃清，只有那孤零零的马安山、郑茂山，还在敌人手中，但已被我紧紧包围了。
    三
    纵队指挥所急速向辛庄以南的琵琶山上转移，这里距商埠不过二华里，市区的轮廓清楚地出现在眼前。
    我们向兵团许司令员报告了新的部署后，决定当晚就夺取商埠，协同九纵攻外城。
    黄昏之前，高师长突然来电话：“商埠的敌人前来后去，不像反击的样子，可能有新部署。”正好又接到三七师报告：“敌人在调防。”我当即命令他们：“动手，快攻！”
    随着隆隆的炮声，爆炸声传来了捷报，高师长在电话里叫：“给敌人一个措手不及，大槐树、卡子门给炸开了，部队正在往里发展……三纵、鲁纵要求从这里进！”“太好了，快请他们进吧！”我激动地说。
    我们从地图上，仿佛看到三路大军浩浩荡荡地打进商埠，打到了王耀武的“绥靖公署”，勇士们猛力地向前压缩，逐屋争夺着，追击着，歼灭着敌人。
    经一夜激战，三七师抵外城永绥门下，此时，兄弟部队三纵、鲁纵一部也抵普利门、林祥门外。
    天明，部队忙着做攻城准备。纵队指挥所随即前移至东白马山以西的无名高地的寨子里。我们立刻做了新的攻城部署，三七师主攻外城，从永绥门两侧突破，向内城坤顺门突击，三八师调一个团协同，过外城向坤顺门东南突击，和九纵会合。
    我们向许司令员报告了部署情况，许司令员连声说：“好好，今晚就攻城，要害要打狠！”
    下午，政委和我到三七师去观察地形和部队的情况，走出指挥所，天渐渐暗下来，只有天上的云彩，还涂着一层红色。我们走过一处高大的建筑物，这里的钢骨水泥的大楼已被炮火摧毁，只剩下乌黑的架子，熊熊的大火还在燃烧；残破的地堡上、窗户上、楼梯上、马路上，到处是敌人的尸体。原来，这就是王耀武的“绥靖公署”司令部所在地。几天激战，已把敌人压进内城，四面八方越来越紧地包围住城关，王耀武被歼的命运已在所难逃了。
    黄昏之后，激烈的登城战开始。经数小时争夺，三七师、三八师同时报告：永绥门，杆石桥两处均已突破，正迅速向内城逼近。拂晓，又打到内城坤顺门以南、营房街以西地区，逼近城墙。三八师并在南门和九纵胜利会师，携手并肩地投入攻内城的准备。
    至此，紧紧地箝住内城了。

    许司令员得到这一报告后，高兴地回答说：
    “好得很，晚上配合九纵攻内城，继续给敌人以猛烈的打击，迫敌措手不及。”
    战斗打响后，部队连续作战，战士们都很疲劳，加上有些伤亡，需要组织一下，而内城不比外城，更难打，当晚部队就要配合九纵攻内城，确实有困难，但问题也很清楚，要想不让敌人得到一刻的喘息机会，就得连续打，上级的决心决不可动摇。政委和我于是分头下去动员部队，准备一举攻下内城，把最后的敌人消灭光，活捉王耀武。战士们个个都豪迈地表示：没有问题。
    为打开最后一道关——内城，部队紧张地准备着。
    战斗的第五个黄昏十六时，我们发起了向内城攻击。内城是敌人最后顽抗的堡垒，城墙高约三丈余，厚有八米，完全用大石条砌成，笔陡险要，墙下碉堡密布，墙上射孔数层，护城河河宽水深，守备内城的是王耀武的嫡系精锐部队。王耀武是国民党所谓名将，山东的实力派、土霸王，他自己的嫡系部队从不动用，莱芜战役时，他眼望李仙洲被我军活捉不去援救，留着部队妄想死守济南。
    战斗越来越紧张，沉重的爆炸声一阵接一阵地传来，战士们在设法用大竹杆登城，争夺突破口。
    深夜二时，高师长紧张、激动地向我报告：
    “第一次把城墙炸了个圆洞，没有进去；第二次把城墙炸了条口子，架了梯子还上不去；这次突上去的部队，堆在城墙上，向两侧运动不开，只有黄新和同志带一营部分人，下了城向纵侧进展……。”
    与此同时，兵团司令部告诉我们，九纵已突进内城，要我们快攻，这使我既高兴又紧张。
    一会儿，高师长又来电话说：“激烈地争夺突破口，伤亡大，坤顺门仍未突破。”
      “老大哥进去了，不要落后，坚决拚进去！”
      “好的，我们一定拚进去！”话被炮声震断了！
    东方渐渐发白，变红了，圆圆的太阳露出一点脸来，城头的争夺战还在激烈进行着。这时，高师长又在电话里焦急地说：
    “突破口叫王耀武的特务团夺去了，下城的部队被割开……。”
    “什么？夺去了？坚决打，不惜任何牺牲！”
    情况是严重的，我们突不破，就增加了兄弟纵队的困难，我随即向许司令员报告，他镇定地说：
      “没关系，组织继续攻，我马上叫九纵向西和你们会合！”……
    情况还是不好，高师长又向我报告：“一、三营从坤顺门两侧突击，被敌猛烈火力阻止；三营长刘坤同志带全营强攻上去和敌人展开肉搏，负了重伤，详情不知……”。
      “继续拚！叫团长带着拚！你们攻不上去，再叫三八师接着攻。一定要攻上去，我马上叫榴炮团支援你们……。”我焦急地回答。
    城头苦战已达到白热化的程度，战士们在敌人居高临下的火网里，拚着生命，向城头攀登。当太阳升起丈把高的时候，高师长在电话里喊起来：
      “砸开了，突破了，我们的两个团正往里涌进！……”
    我这才松了口气。事后，知道城头争夺战是多么激烈：刘坤营长牺牲了，部队与敌在城墙上进行肉搏战，最后只剩下一个班，但他们寸步不退。最后，拚到只剩下九连的王班长一个人。这个身体粗壮、个子不高、面色黝黑的班长，像座推不动、打不倒的泰山把住突破口，他抓起敌人的两箱子手榴弹，向左右猛打。敌人大喊：“投降吧！”他说：“好哇，我没子弹了，你们来吧，我这里有地瓜，花生米……”结果敌人死伤累累，突破口还在王班长脚下。他的英勇，减少了部队的伤亡，他的英勇，为部队争取了迅速歼敌的时间。在战后的英模大会上，我满怀尊敬的心情，特地去找这个班长，问他：
      “当时，你为啥不撤呢？”
    他说：“我们突击上来，牺牲了多少同志才占了这个口子，我要是退下去，后面部队再突击，又要付出多少同志的鲜血！再说，已经突到城里的一部分部队就要被敌人切断，我怎么能退？……”
    看，这就是我们一个普通战士的思想！
    突下城去的黄新和同志，只顾往前扑，当他们发现城头上堆满敌人时，就把逮的俘虏往屋里一锁说：“出来者死！”组织了一下仅有的一排人，左冲右突向突破口迫击过来，从背后猛攻敌人。敌人一时不知所措，惊慌地向两边撤开，黄新和带着一排人和王班长会合了。由于他们的英勇顽强，占住突破口，使后续部队迅速地突进了内城。
    五
    内城被击破，王耀武的乌龟壳被打开了！
    此时，许司令员来电话问：“怎么样了！”我向他扼要地报告了一下，他兴奋地说：
    “好好！你们快和九纵会合！”
    最后歼灭敌人的时刻终于到了。
    但就在这胜利前夕，传来了不幸的消息：三七师的指挥所向内城移进时，遭到敌人的轰炸，政委徐海山同志当场牺牲了，高师长身上被压重伤，还牺牲了其他同志……。
    我难受极了。胜利是同志们的鲜血换来的，每一胜利，要付出多么重大的代价啊！我忍不住骂敌人：“看你还能疯狂几时，王耀武，你被歼的命运就在眼前了！”
    就在这时，兵团司令部发出振奋人心的消息，内城被我们多处打开了，三纵、九纵、鲁纵、渤纵、我纵勇猛地向大明湖畔、敌人省府所在地合拢。我虽心情沉重，但被这个大胜利所鼓舞，我离开地图走出指挥所，站在那高高的无名高地上，望见内城一片火海，浓烟腾腾，我军正在全歼最后之敌，王耀武的所谓精锐部队，已没有任何力量阻挡我军排山倒海的攻势了。
    内城枪声稀落下来，战斗接近尾声。三八师徐师长在电话里带着遗憾的口气说：
      “王耀武跑了，抓到了他的参谋罗辛礼！”
    “跑了？跑不了！”我冷冷地说：“王耀武可以逃出济南，但是他插翅也难逃出解放区。解放区的每一村庄，每一个人都在等待着捉拿他。”
    这是第六天的黄昏，晚霞映红了整个西天，映红了济南城，王耀武用十万重兵把守的济南府，被我军解放了。以新五军为首的徐州数十万敌人，不敢投入我野战军布下的罗网，只好惊恐地望着王耀武集团复没。
