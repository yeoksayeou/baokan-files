How to Overcome Severe Cold and Protect Pigs for a Safe Winter

Winter, especially the late autumn and early winter and the winter-spring transition, is a period of alternating cold and warmth, with outbreaks of cold waves and sudden changes in temperature, which is very detrimental to the safe wintering of pigs. If a cold wave suddenly strikes, it will cause physiological imbalances in the pigs. At this time, due to excessive heat dissipation and intensified metabolism, the consumption of heat is too great, causing the pigs to become thin, or become ill due to weakened resistance, and may even freeze to death. Generally speaking, if the temperature of the pigsty is below 5 degrees Celsius, the pigs will suffer from frost damage.

To overcome the harm of severe cold to pigs, it is necessary to do a good job in cold protection. Cold protection work must be grasped on two fronts: on the one hand, prepare for cold protection in advance, and on the other hand, actively carry out cold protection when cold waves strike. Cold protection work should be grasped early and well, and strive for the initiative. Before winter, we should strengthen feeding management, prepare sufficient feed as early as possible, master appropriate food when feeding, adopt the method of eating less and more frequently, feed hot and full, and increase salt water to increase the cold resistance of pigs. Sows, piglets, and pigs of different sizes and strengths should be raised in separate pens. Put pigs with poor cold resistance into warmer and sunnier pens. Sick and weak pigs should be raised in concentration, fed more refined feed, and strengthened care. The repair work of sheds should also be done as early as possible to ensure that the pens do not leak rain and the walls do not let in wind. In addition, always pay attention to the weather forecast. When a cold wave strikes, it is necessary to take necessary cold protection measures based on the specific local conditions at that time. For example, put sleeping boards for large pigs and straw nests for piglets, pad them at night and dry them during the day to keep the pens dry and warm; change new grass in the pens, add grass curtains to the shed doors, and fill dry soil in the sheds; or take measures to enhance warmth, such as having sheds inside sheds and pens inside pens; if necessary, you can also make a fire in the pigsty to add warmth, so that the temperature in the shed can always be maintained above the frost damage index.

    怎样战胜严寒护猪安全过冬
    冬季特别是秋末冬初和冬春之交，冷暖交替，寒潮暴发，乍暖乍寒，这对生猪的安全过冬很不利，如果寒潮突然侵袭，又会使生猪生理失调。这时，猪体由于散热过多，新陈代谢作用加强，消耗热量过大，猪就会因此而消瘦，或因抵抗力减弱而患病，甚至会冻死。一般说来，猪舍的温度低于摄氏五度，猪只就会受到冻害。
    要战胜严寒对生猪的危害，必须作好防寒工作。防寒工作要抓两手：一方面，要事先做好防寒准备工作，另一方面，寒潮袭击时要积极进行防寒。防寒工作要抓早、抓好，争取主动。在入冬前就应加强饲养管理，及早备足饲料，喂食时要掌握适宜的食品，喂的方法宜少吃多餐，喂热喂饱，并增喂盐水，以增加生猪的抗寒力。母猪、仔猪、大小强弱的猪要分圈饲养，将耐寒性较差的猪放入比较温暖向阳的圈内，病弱的猪更要集中饲养，多喂精料，加强护理。棚圈的修补工作也要及早作好，使圈不漏雨、墙不透风。此外，还要随时注意天气预报。当寒潮袭来时，就要根据当时当地的具体情况，采取必要的防寒措施。例如给大猪垫上睡板、小猪垫上草窝，晚上垫，白天晒，保持圈内干燥、温和；圈内换新草、棚门加草帘、棚内填干土：或采取棚内有棚、圈内有圈等增强保暖措施；必要时，还可在猪舍内生火添暖，使棚圈内温度经常能保持在冻害指标以上。
