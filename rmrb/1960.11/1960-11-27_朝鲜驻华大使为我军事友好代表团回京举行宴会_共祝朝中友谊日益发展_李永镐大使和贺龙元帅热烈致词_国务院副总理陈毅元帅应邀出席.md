Xinhua News Agency, 26th - Korean Democratic People's Republic Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, held a banquet tonight for the return of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation after its visit to Korea.

The head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, Marshal He Long, Deputy Head General Luo Ruiqing, and all members of the delegation attended the banquet.

Vice Premier of the State Council, Marshal Chen Yi, was invited to attend the banquet.

At the banquet, which was filled with the brotherly sentiments of China and Korea, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses to congratulate the growing development and consolidation of the combat friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Korea, cemented in blood, and to congratulate the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, may it shine forever.

In his speech, Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that the long and profound friendship between the peoples of Korea and China cannot be fully written even in a long masterpiece. The peoples of the two countries have long engaged in the struggle against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism. The peoples of the two countries have shared weal and woe, and fought together to achieve final victory.

Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that the Korean-Chinese friendship, based on Marxism-Leninism, is deepening day by day and is eternal, and cannot be destroyed by any enemy. He said that we do not harbor any illusions about imperialism, and we resolutely oppose modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique. U.S. imperialism still occupies the southern part of Korea and China's territory of Taiwan. As long as U.S. imperialism continues to carry out aggression against us, the peoples of Korea and China will fight it to the end forever, and our steps will always be consistent.

At the banquet, Marshal He Long warmly praised the great achievements of the Korean people in socialist construction. He said that when I went to Korea in 1953, Pyongyang was a pile of ruins, with only two broken houses left; now Pyongyang has become a brand-new, modern city. Korea's post-war reconstruction work is amazing, and the achievements of socialist construction are also great. These achievements should be attributed to the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung.

Marshal He Long said that the peoples and armies of China and Korea are unbreakable with the common thought of Marxism-Leninism and the combat friendship cemented in blood. He said that in the struggle against imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism and against modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique, we will always stand together.

Generals and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including General Xiao Hua, General Yang Chengwu, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Qiu Huizuo, Navy Lieutenant General Liu Daosheng, and Air Force Major General He Tingyi, were also invited to the banquet.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Zhixiang, President of the Sino-Korean Friendship Association Li Dequan, Vice President Lao She, and others were also invited to the banquet.

    新华社26日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐，今晚为中国访朝军事友好代表团回到北京举行宴会。
    我国访朝军事友好代表团团长贺龙元帅、副团长罗瑞卿大将和全体团员出席了宴会。
    国务院副总理陈毅元帅应邀出席了宴会。
    在充满着中朝两国兄弟般情谊的宴会上，宾主不断举杯，祝贺中朝两国人民及其军队之间以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊日益发展和巩固，祝贺以苏联为首的社会主义阵营伟大团结，永放光辉。
    李永镐大使在致词中说，朝中两国人民悠久的深厚友谊用长篇巨著也是写不完的。两国人民长期以来进行了反帝特别是反对美帝国主义的斗争，两国人民同甘共苦，共同斗争取得了最后的胜利。
    李永镐大使说，建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的朝中友谊是日益加深而且是永恒的，是任何敌人破坏不了的。他说，我们对帝国主义不抱任何幻想，我们坚决反对以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义。美帝国主义至今还霸占着朝鲜南部和中国领土台湾，只要美帝国主义继续对我们进行侵略，朝中两国人民就要永远与它斗争到底，我们的步调永远是一致的。
    贺龙元帅在宴会上热烈赞扬朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就。他说，我1953年到朝鲜的时候，那时的平壤是一片废墟，只剩下两栋破房子；现在的平壤却成了崭新的现代化的城市。朝鲜的战后恢复工作是惊人的，社会主义建设的成绩也是伟大的，这些成就的取得应归功于以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的正确领导。
    贺龙元帅说，中朝两国人民和军队，用马克思列宁主义的共同思想和以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊是牢不可破的。他说，在反对美帝国主义为首的帝国主义侵略和反对以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义的斗争中，我们将永远站在一起。
