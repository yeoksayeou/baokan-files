    Tractor Driver Hou Zhengyuan
    By Our Correspondent Tan Feng
            A Miracle on the Mechanized Farming Front
    In June 1959, Hou Zhengyuan, an advanced tractor driver from the Shihezi General Farm of the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region, shook the mechanized farming front with his achievement of operating a Soviet "Belarus" tractor for more than 13,000 hours without major repairs, completing 130,900 standard mu, equivalent to seventeen years' worth of work. When the news reached the Minsk Tractor Factory in the Soviet Union, the manufacturer of the "Belarus" tractor, the workers believed it was an unprecedented miracle and an honor for their factory. They sent a representative to Shihezi General Farm to present an honorary certificate to Hou Zhengyuan. Soviet mechanical expert K. S. Yilov, after a detailed inspection of Hou Zhengyuan's tractor, said, "With a little more effort, this tractor could reach 20,000 hours without major overhaul." "Twenty thousand?" Many veteran drivers waited with doubt and anticipation for news of Hou Zhengyuan's continued operation. A year passed, and when the reporter recently arrived at Shihezi General Farm, Hou Zhengyuan's tractor had extended the interval between repairs to more than 22,000 hours, extending four major repair intervals. In four and a half years, he completed more than 218,000 standard mu of work, equivalent to the state's 1960 quota for eighteen years (each standard unit's annual workload is 12,000 standard mu).
            Diligent and Conscientious, Four Years as One Day
    Hou Zhengyuan's ability to create such astonishing achievements stems from his love for the Party's cause and his unwavering commitment to his work with a high sense of responsibility. Since taking over the tractor in 1956, he has performed scheduled maintenance every day, without interruption, regardless of wind, rain, snow, or cold weather, and has never missed a scheduled time. In January of this year, the tractor had just arrived at the Mosuowan construction site when it was time for maintenance. At that time, it was the coldest part of winter, with temperatures below thirty degrees Celsius. The wilderness wind was piercing, and fingers could not bend. The co-driver said, "Let's change the maintenance schedule this time!" Hou Zhengyuan said, "We can't do that. Only by adhering to scheduled maintenance can we prolong the life of the tractor." They lit a fire in the wilderness to melt the oil, braving the cold wind, and like usual, they didn't start driving until all the parts were properly maintained. Relying on this high sense of responsibility for protecting state property, the "Belarus" tractor he drove did not experience a single breakdown in more than a thousand days and nights of operation. The tractor went out in the wind and returned through the mud every day, and apart from replacing a small ball bearing disc, it didn't break a single part or get a single scratch. After visiting Hou Zhengyuan's tractor, tractor drivers from all over marveled, "Only a superhuman sense of responsibility can create such a miracle."
    Opening Hou Zhengyuan's attendance book, you won't find a single blank space without work points recorded. He has never been absent from work or taken a day off in four and a half years. Rainy and snowy days when he can't take the tractor out are a good time for him to maintain the tractor. Last New Year's Eve, Hou Zhengyuan came back very late because he was rushing to complete a task. The New Year's party in the club was in full swing, and the captain specially invited him to see a movie, but Hou Zhengyuan said, "People celebrate the New Year, and so does the tractor!" He and his comrades in the team used New Year's Eve to thoroughly inspect and maintain the tractor, cleaning it spotlessly before going back to sleep. After New Year's Day, while others were still maintaining their tractors, his tractor was already speeding across the fields. Because of this, Hou Zhengyuan's attendance rate is particularly high. From New Year's Day to mid-October this year, in two hundred and ninety days, his tractor worked six hundred and sixteen shifts (each shift is ten hours, two shifts per day).
    Hou Zhengyuan is a person who loves his tractor as much as his own life. No matter how tense or tiring the work is, his tractor is always clean. He said, "Our country doesn't produce many tractors yet. The Party has entrusted such valuable property to me, and I should cherish it as I cherish my own eyes." In November last year, when Hou Zhengyuan participated in the National Heroes Conference in Beijing, he was truly in Beijing, but his heart was in Shihezi, and he even dreamed of his tractor while sleeping. The meeting ended in the afternoon, and he bought a ticket to Xinjiang that evening. When he returned to the farm, he rushed to the field without going home. As soon as he heard the sound of the tractor, he ran and shouted for the driver to stop. He ran to the front of the tractor and immediately checked all the parts of the tractor, adjusted the throttle and fuel system, and listened carefully to the sound of the tractor starting before a relaxed and happy smile appeared on his face. It turned out that he had heard the problem with the tractor from the sound from a great distance, and he was so anxious that he forgot to greet his long-separated comrades.
    Once a Communist Party member's high sense of responsibility is combined with technology, it will exert a powerful force. Relying on diligent study, Hou Zhengyuan created the maintenance of the "three cleans" (clean oil, clean water, clean air); the "four checks" before departure (check steering for flexibility, check brakes, check lighting, check roads and bridges), "eight slow" driving techniques and "eight prohibitions" – a complete set of operating and maintenance experiences. The tractor he drives has run for more than 22,000 hours without a single major overhaul. In the past four and a half years, not counting the wealth he has created for the country, the maintenance costs and fuel saved alone could buy five more "Belarus" tractors.
              Always Thinking of Production
    How to make his tractor better serve production is the starting point for Hou Zhengyuan's consideration of all issues.
    In the farm's large-scale cultivation, production requires tractor drivers to cultivate more and faster, ensuring the number of cultivations, and to cultivate deeply and finely, ensuring quality, in order to strive for a bumper harvest. However, not all tractor drivers can correctly resolve this contradiction. Some people often emphasize work efficiency and neglect quality, causing dissatisfaction among the production teams. Hou Zhengyuan keeps in mind the farm Party committee's instruction: "Quality is production." He said: "We are all working for a bumper harvest, and we must seek work efficiency in quality." Therefore, he always considers the production team, and the cultivation is very meticulous. Even in the headlands and corners where the tractor is difficult to maneuver, he tries to cultivate thoroughly. People in the production team say that the land cultivated by Hou Zhengyuan doesn't need to be checked. Once, a driver in the team was ditching sunflower fields for the Third Team, and Hou Zhengyuan himself checked the furrows one by one because the production team leader hadn't arrived. When he found that a few furrows were missing, he immediately criticized the driver, took the initiative to apologize to the production team, and asked the driver to use a hoe to dig the missing furrows. The two drivers dug for a whole morning and only completed one furrow. Hou Zhengyuan used this incident to educate everyone: "It would only take ten minutes to dig these few furrows with a tractor. We're trying to be quick and save a little time, but it takes a farm worker a whole day of hard work, and it also delays production." Whenever Hou Zhengyuan encounters substandard cultivation, he always takes the initiative to rework it, making the production team satisfied. Under his influence, all the drivers in the team have established the idea of serving production wholeheartedly. They regard the difficulties of the production team as their own difficulties.
            Helping Others Catch Up with Themselves
    Treating the difficulties of others as one's own and helping others catch up with oneself has become Hou Zhengyuan's consistent style. An old tractor driver named Chen Qiping said to me enthusiastically: "Hou Zhengyuan is not only our model worker, but also our role model in ideological style." He is Hou Zhengyuan's old rival in competition. In recent years, he has always been closely chasing Hou Zhengyuan. When Hou Zhengyuan goes to work, he goes to work. He learns from Hou Zhengyuan's maintenance methods, and the achievements of the two are similar.
    At a Party branch meeting, Chen Qiping proposed to surpass Hou Zhengyuan. Hou Zhengyuan immediately stood up and said, "We must continue to stay ahead of you!" The two tractor teams then launched a competition. Not long after the meeting, in order to rush through the mid-cultivation, Chen Qiping took on the task of mid-cultivating cotton, which he had never done before. The tractor was driven to the headland, and because he was not skilled, the cultivator could not be adjusted properly after several hours had passed. Chen Qiping was standing on the headland, anxiously. At this time, a greeting suddenly came: "Old Chen, how's it going?" He looked back and saw Hou Zhengyuan. It turned out that Hou Zhengyuan had just finished the night shift and came over without sleeping after hearing that Chen Qiping was mid-cultivating cotton. "You should rest. You have a shift tonight." Chen Qiping said with concern. Hou Zhengyuan waved his hand: "You drive, and I'll be your cultivator!" Without waiting for Chen Qiping to object, he sat down in the seat of the implement operator. He helped the implement operator adjust the depth and row spacing of the cultivator. When it was calculated at dusk, the results of this day were similar to those of Hou Zhengyuan's tractor team. Chen Qiping held Hou Zhengyuan's hand, and both smiled knowingly.
    Since joining the revolution in 1949, Hou Zhengyuan has been a meritorious worker and model worker almost every year. In the arduous land reclamation of 1950, he was hailed as a "hero of hoeing," and now he is a national tractor driver pacesetter, a first-class labor model of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and met Chairman Mao at the National Heroes Conference in Beijing in 1959. People have asked Hou Zhengyuan more than once: "What is the force that drives you to move forward so quickly and keeps you always ahead of time?" Hou Zhengyuan answers every time with these words: "It is the beloved Party that has given me endless strength!"

    拖拉机手侯正元
    本报记者　谈风
            机耕战线上的奇迹
    1959年6月，新疆生产建设兵团玛纳斯垦区石河子总场的先进拖拉机手侯正元，驾驶苏联“莫特兹”牌拖拉机，运行一万三千多小时无大修，三年半完成十七年工作量十三万零九百标准亩的事迹，震动了机耕战线。这个消息传到“莫特兹”牌拖拉机制造者——苏联明斯克拖拉机制造厂时，职工们认为这是一个没有先例的奇迹，是他们制造厂的荣誉，特派代表到石河子总场，把一个荣誉奖状授给了侯正元。苏联机械专家克希洛夫在详细检查了侯正元的机车后说：“再努一把力，这部车有可能达到两万小时无大修。”“两万？”许多老驾驶员抱着惊疑的心情等待着侯正元继续运行的消息。一年过去了，当记者最近来到石河子总场的时候，侯正元的机车已把修理间距延长到二万二千多小时，延长了四个大修间距；在四年半中，完成了二十一万八千多个标准亩的工作量，相当于国家1960年定额十八年的任务（每个标准台年工作量为一万二千标准亩）。
            勤勤恳恳四年如一日
    侯正元所以能创造这样惊人的成绩，是因为他热爱党的事业，时时刻刻都以高度的责任心，一丝不苟地从事自己的工作。他从1956年接车到现在，每天定时保养，不管刮风下雨，雪地寒天，从未中断过一次，也从未错过规定的时间。今年1月间，机车刚到莫索湾工地，就到了保养时间。当时正是零下三十多度的数九寒天，旷野寒风凛冽，手指不能屈伸，副驾驶说：“咱们改一次时间保养吧！”侯正元说：“不能这样，只有坚持定时保养才能延长机车的寿命。”他们在旷野燃起火堆，烤化了机油，顶着寒风，像往常一样，直到各部件都保养妥贴了才开始行车。靠着这种高度爱护国家财产的责任感，他驾驶的“莫特兹”牌拖拉机，在运行一千多个昼夜里，没发生过一次故障。机车每天风里来，泥里去，除换了一个小弹子盘，没坏过一个零件，没碰过一个伤疤。各地拖拉机手们参观了侯正元的机车后，惊叹地说：“只有超人的责任感，才能创造这样的奇迹。”
    翻开侯正元的考勤簿，找不到一个没记工的空格。四年半他没缺过一次勤，也没请过一次假。大雨大雪天不能出车，正是他保养机车的好时机。去年除夕，侯正元因为赶任务，回来已经很晚，俱乐部里新年晚会开得正热闹，队长特意请他去看电影，侯正元却说：“人过年，车也要过年！”他和全组同志利用除夕，把机车彻底检查和保养了一遍，擦洗得干干净净才回去睡觉。元旦过后，别人正保养机车，他的车早在田野上驰骋起来。正因为如此，侯正元的出车率特别高，从今年元旦到10月中旬二百九十天中，他的机车却出勤六百一十六个班次（规定每十小时一班，每天两班）。
    侯正元是个爱车如命的人，不管一天工作多么紧张，多么劳累，他的机车总是干干净净。他说：“我们国家生产的拖拉机还不多，党把这样宝贵的财产交给我，应该像爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护它。”去年11月间，侯正元在北京参加群英会时，真是人在北京，心在石河子，睡觉也梦到自己的拖拉机。会议下午结束，晚上就买了票往新疆赶，回到农场的那天，顾不得回家就奔向田野。当他一听见拖拉机的声音，一边跑，一边喊叫驾驶员停车，跑到车前立即检查了机车的各部机件，调整了油门和输油系统，又仔细听了听机车发动的声音，才见他脸上露出轻松愉快的笑容。原来他在很远的地方，就从声音中听出机车有毛病，因为心里着急，竟忘了和久别的同志们打招呼。
    共产党员的高度责任感一旦和技术结合起来，就会发挥出强大的威力。侯正元依靠刻苦钻研，创造出保养三大净（油净、水净、空气净）；出车四查（查转向是否灵活、查刹车、查照明、查道路桥梁），行车八慢和八不许一整套操纵、保养经验……。他驾驶的拖拉机行驶了二万二千多小时，连一次也没有大修过。四年半来，不算他为国家创造的财富，光是节约的维修费用和油料，就可以再购买五台“莫特兹”牌拖拉机。
              处处为生产着想
    如何使自己的机车更好地为生产服务，是侯正元考虑一切问题的出发点。
    在农场大面积的耕作中，生产上要求拖拉机手们既要多耕、快耕，保证耕作次数，又要耕深、耕细，保证质量，才能争取丰收。但并不是所有拖拉机手都能正确地解决这个矛盾，有些人往往强调工效而忽视质量，引起生产队的不满。侯正元牢记着农场党委的指示：“质量就是产量”，他说：“我们都是为丰收工作，要在质量中求工效。”因此他处处为生产队着想，耕作非常细致，即使地头地角拖拉机难活动的地方，他也设法耕透。生产队的人说，侯正元耕作的地用不着检查。有一次组里一个驾驶员给三队的葵花地开沟，生产队负责人没来，侯正元便自己逐垅检查，发现漏了几沟，他立刻批评了驾驶员，主动向生产队作了检讨，并叫驾驶员用砍土镘开漏掉的沟。两个驾驶员挖了一个上午，只开出一个沟。侯正元便用这个事教育大家：“用拖拉机开这几沟不过十几分钟，我们图快省这点时间，却要一个农工辛辛苦苦挖一天，还耽误了生产。”侯正元每遇到耕作不合格时，他总是主动返工，使生产队满意。在他的影响下，全组驾驶员都树立了全心全意为生产服务的思想，他们把生产队的困难看作是自己的困难。
            帮助别人赶上自己
    把别人的困难当作自己的困难，帮助别人赶上自己，已经成了侯正元一贯的风格。一个叫陈启平的老拖拉机手热诚地对我说：“侯正元不仅在工作上是我们的标兵，在思想风格上也是我们的榜样。”他是侯正元竞赛的老对手，几年来，他总是紧紧追赶着侯正元，侯正元出车，他也出车，侯正元怎样保养，他吸取着经验，两人成绩也差不多。
    在一次党支部会上，陈启平提出要赶过侯正元，侯正元立刻站起来说：“我们要继续走在你们前面！”两个机车组从此展开了竞赛。会后不久，为了突击中耕，陈启平担负了从来没干过的中耕棉花的任务。拖拉机开在地头，因为技术不熟练，几个钟头过去了，中耕机总是调整不好，陈启平站在地头干着急。这时，突然传来一声招呼：“老陈，怎么样？”他回头一看是侯正元。原来侯正元刚干完夜班，听到陈启平中耕棉花，没睡觉就赶来了。“你该休息了，晚上还有班。”陈启平关心地说。侯正元摆了摆手：“你开车，我给你当中耕手！”不待陈启平反对，他已坐到农具手坐位上。他帮助农具员调整好中耕机的深度、行距。到黄昏时候一算，这一天的成绩和侯正元机车组差不多。陈启平握着侯正元的手，两人都会心的笑了。
    侯正元从1949年参加革命起，几乎是年年功臣、岁岁模范，在艰苦开荒的1950年，他被誉为“砍土镘英雄”，现在是全国拖拉机手标兵，新疆生产兵团一级劳动模范，1959年在北京群英会上见到了毛主席。人们曾不止一次地问侯正元：“是什么力量促使你飞快前进，使你永远走在时间的前面呢？”侯正元每一次都用这样的话来回答：“是亲爱的党给了我无穷的力量！”
