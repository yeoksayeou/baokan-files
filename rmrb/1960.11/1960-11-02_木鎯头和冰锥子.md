    Wooden Mallet and Ice Pick
    Lan Ying  Xiao Bai
    This wooden mallet and ice pick are relics displayed in the "Third Domestic Revolutionary War Hall" of the Revolutionary Military Museum. They are filled with exciting stories, leading us back to the arduous years of the Liberation War....
    In the winter of 1948, following Chairman Mao's wise decision, the People's Liberation Army laid out the battlefield on the Pingjin front. The thunderous sound of artillery fire broke the silence of the cold winter sky of Pingjin, and the Pingjin Campaign, one of the three decisive battles of the Liberation War, victoriously began. Millions of people in the liberated areas formed a powerful force to support the front lines, transporting grain and ammunition to the Pingjin front day and night. To ensure the victory of the campaign, it was necessary to transport supplies faster. However, the Daqing River, the closest natural waterway on the western Tianjin front, was frozen solid, making it impassable. Facing the frozen river, the people of the liberated areas exclaimed: "Chairman Mao is the sun, the people can summon the spring breeze, there are no obstacles before the revolution, and the ice river can be melted in no time." Sure enough, the people of Xiong County and Jinghai County in Hebei Province organized an ice-breaking team of 40,000 people overnight. Armed with these simple and primitive tools such as wooden mallets and ice picks, they braved the cold, the howling wind, and the icy river. Undaunted by enemy planes or fatigue, they broke open 168 li of ice bed in two days, opening up a waterway to victory, and rapidly and continuously sending supplies to the Pingjin front.

    木鎯头和冰锥子
    兰英  晓白
    这只木鎯头和冰锥子是革命军事博物馆“第三次国内革命战争馆”里陈列的文物，它满载着激动人心的故事，把我们又引回到解放战争艰苦奋斗的年月……。
    1948年冬天，解放军按照毛主席英明的决策，在平津前线摆下了战场，春雷般的炮声划破了平津寒冬天空的沉默，解放战争中具有决定意义的三大战役之一——平津战役揭开了胜利的序幕。解放区千万人民组成了强大的支援前线的队伍，日夜兼程地把粮食弹药运往平津前线。为了保障战役的胜利，必须更快地运送物资，可是一条津西前线的最近自然河道——大清河，却被冻得冰封不通，解放区人民面对封冻的冰河高声说：“毛主席是太阳，人民能叫春风刮，革命面前无阻拦，指日可令冰河化”。果然，河北省雄县和静海县人民，在一夜间就组织起了四万人的破冰大队，他们手里拿着这些简单而原始的木鎯头、冰锥子等工具，不怕天寒风吼冰河冷，不怕敌机，不怕劳累，两天内就把长达一百六十八里的冰床砸开，开辟出一条胜利的航道，把物资迅速源源不断地送往平津前线。（附图片）
