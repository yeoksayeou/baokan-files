Editor's Note: The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Akahata," published on August 14th, under the title "In Order to Implement the Decisions of the Eleventh Plenary Session," "Let Us Aim for the General Election, Strengthen the United Front, Expand the Party!" the report and summary made by Kenji Miyamoto, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, at the Japanese Communist Party National Activists Conference held in Tokyo from August 3rd to 5th. The following is a summary of the report:

Since the decisions of the Eleventh Plenary Session were published, various regions have been actively organizing discussions and implementing these decisions. From the county committee chairman conferences and the subsequent meetings of department heads from various fronts, as well as other activities, we can affirm that the overall situation in the Party is as follows: the decision is supported by an overwhelming majority of Party members, and most members are enthusiastically committed to implementing this decision. At this crucial stage, further unifying our will, organizing future major struggles, especially election campaigns, and realizing the Party's leap forward is not only an important task for the Communist Party, but also extremely important in maintaining and further developing the solidarity – the united front – that we have built together with democratic forces. I would like to discuss some of the situations that have emerged since the publication of that decision, in line with its overall spirit, and report on necessary issues.

(I)
	International Situation
First is the issue of the international situation. The revision of the "Security Treaty" itself is an attack launched by the two enemies, American imperialism and the Japanese monopoly capital group, against the Japanese people, and an attack on world peace. In this sense, the struggle against the "Security Treaty," viewed in connection with the recent international situation, has played an important role. During this period, a series of events occurred in particular: the heroic struggle of the South Korean people, the collapse of the Rhee Syngman government resulting from this struggle, the U-2 spy plane incident, and the failure of the East-West summit. These events have also had a significant impact on the struggle in Japan. During this period, American imperialists, since Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States, have consistently pursued a policy of aggression while adopting a posture of agreeing to talks.

Why did American imperialism adopt a posture of at least agreeing to talks? Some within our Party have held views such as: "Doesn't American imperialism also have a peaceful side in essence?" However, our Party, fully consistent with the analysis in the Moscow Declaration, has always maintained that the essence of American imperialism has not changed. Starting from this point, for example, regarding the issue of Eisenhower's visit to Japan, even before the U-2 spy plane incident occurred, we believed that the most fundamental role of his visit was to obstruct peace in Asia as well as Japan's peace and independence, and therefore clearly expressed our opposition.

The development of the international and domestic situation has confirmed that our Party's views are completely correct. The reasons why the United States adopted a posture of at least agreeing to talks with the Soviet Union are:

First, the peace policy of the socialist countries is gaining increasing support from the broad masses, especially as the Soviet Union has surpassed American imperialism in both military and scientific fields. Therefore, the fact that America's policy of strength has not achieved much effect has had to be exposed to the people of the world to some extent.

Second, the struggles of people around the world against colonialism and war are rising higher day by day. As demonstrated by the Cuban liberation struggle, the forces of national liberation and peace throughout the world have made progress.

Third, America's position in the international arena has been relatively weakened. At the same time, the contradictions within the imperialist camp, such as the contradictions between Britain and the United States, have also deepened; in terms of policy towards the Soviet Union, the United States also found it difficult to continue pursuing the policies of the Dulles clique.

These changes in the balance of power and their internal contradictions are the main reasons why American imperialism, while fundamentally continuing to pursue policies of war and aggression, had to seize the opportunity of Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States to adopt the direction of at least agreeing to hold summits and talks.

Moreover, even after the fact that U-2 planes had been conducting espionage activities for four years was exposed, American imperialism stubbornly blamed the Soviet Union for the failure to hold the summit. Recently, the two major parties in the United States held conventions. In the keynote speech at the Republican convention, Judd emphasized that winning the Cold War is the supreme requirement. Although the Democrats criticized the government, they also clearly stated their disagreement with the line of allowing China to join the United Nations. Regarding the struggle of the Japanese people, they have consistently attacked the Communist Party, saying that it is a conspiracy of international communism, a conspiracy of a small number of communists in Japan, and so on.

However, they are not adopting this policy because their strength has increased, but because, although their overall strength has been relatively weakened, as long as they are imperialists, they will continue to pursue policies of aggression and war. In response to this situation, people of all countries are increasingly stubbornly continuing to wage struggles for peace and independence, opposing the cold war policies of those imperialists. Although our people have not yet achieved complete victory, they have already dealt a major blow to the two enemies in this struggle. Needless to say, this has also made a great contribution to world peace.

Recently, in Italy, in Britain, and in short, in those places where there are bases of American imperialists, the struggle against the bases is strengthening. In addition, in Cuba, in response to the ever-developing national liberation and democratic revolution, the American government is conducting intimidation, threatening economic blockade or intervention. However, the Soviet Union has stated its attitude: if the United States implements armed intervention, it will resolutely give it the deserved rebuff.

The United States once strangled the struggle in Guatemala. Looking back from the situation at that time to today, we can see that the favorable situation brought about by the progress of socialism and national liberation and peace forces throughout the world greatly encourages the advancement of the Cuban democratic revolution. The Congo was said to be a model colony in Africa, suffering from typical colonial suffering for eighty years. In this Congo, although Belgium granted formal independence, it actually adopted a policy of maintaining its colonial privileges, and therefore, a major national struggle occurred.

While the struggles of the people of various countries are making progress, the socialist countries have consistently continued to adopt a policy of peace after the failure to hold the summit. On June 3rd, the Soviet government once again put forward a new proposal on complete disarmament. This shows that the Soviet government sincerely hopes for world peace, hopes for the summit to be held, and even after this meeting was disrupted by the U-2 spy plane incident, it still faithfully continued to adopt a policy of peaceful coexistence.

Secondly, on August 1st, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai suggested at the Swiss National Day reception that Asian countries and Pacific Rim countries, including the United States, sign a treaty of mutual non-aggression, turning the entire region into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. This, in response to the imperialists' counter-propaganda that China does not want peaceful coexistence, proved to the world that the People's Republic of China, while signing a series of treaties of peace and friendship with Asian countries and pursuing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, also put forward positive proposals for Asian peace.

The meetings of the Standing Committee and the Council of the World Peace Council held during this period, and the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs currently being held in Japan, prove that the world's peace forces, while clearly pointing out the enemies of peace, are also strengthening the unity of the world's peace forces based on the firm confidence that they can win peace.

Not long ago, representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the socialist countries attending the Romanian Communist Party Congress in Bucharest reaffirmed the Moscow Declaration of 1957, confirming the important arguments contained in this declaration, the possibility of preventing war, but also the danger of war as long as imperialists exist, and therefore the need to not relax vigilance and to fight for peace, as well as the important propositions such as the issue of peaceful or non-peaceful revolutionary transition.

We adopted a resolution at the Twelfth Plenary Session of the Central Committee held the day before yesterday, expressing full support for this Bucharest Declaration. We not only support it, but it can also be said that in the struggle against the "Security Treaty," we have clearly recognized that American imperialism is the center of reactionary forces in the world (as the Moscow Declaration also stated), and while consistently continuing the struggle for peace and independence, we have made great contributions to world peace and Japan's independence and freedom together with the Japanese people.

Needless to say, Marxism-Leninism, in its basic principles, is strictly defending the various principles that have been clarified both theoretically and practically in the world communist movement, and is developing day by day in the struggle against left and right deviations. Therefore, today, under the new circumstances, the Communist Parties of various countries, in the process of doing their best to accomplish their own tasks, must of course strive to develop Marxism-Leninism themselves.

The parties of various countries are developing in theory and practice the necessary parts of those arguments, especially those that are necessary, according to the situation and tasks of their own countries. We, from the standpoint of being responsible for the movement in our own country, are striving for the development of Marxism-Leninism.

At the same time, of course, since it is something built on a scientific basis, communists all over the world are naturally able to consistently achieve fundamental agreement on basic international situations and various revolutionary principles. Even when we have various problems, we must constantly safeguard the essence of consistency based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism from the root; it can also be said that we must protect it like the apple of our eye, while opposing all deviations, maintaining the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and developing it.

Therefore, we believe that while we strongly support the world communist movement in strengthening unity in the direction of the Moscow Declaration and moving forward, we have a responsibility to do our best for the creative development of Marxism-Leninism in Japan and the liberation of the Japanese people on the basis of this mutual solidarity.

The above-mentioned international situation tells us that the ever-growing socialist camp, the forces of peace, the forces of national liberation, and the democratic forces of the people are strengthening their strength day by day; conversely, the contradictions in the imperialist camp are becoming increasingly acute, and although its aggressive policies are going bankrupt, it still regards the Cold War as the supreme requirement, clinging to it and challenging the direction of human progress and peace.

However, they will never be victorious in the future; because they are running counter to the tide of progress in the world, they will eventually fail throughout the world and in every country. We are increasingly firmly strengthening such confidence. Having waged the struggle against the "Security Treaty" today, although there are still many difficulties ahead of us, we must go all out for the unity of the Japanese people's struggle with such strong confidence: our struggle is a struggle that is advancing along the road of progress and justice in the world, and it has the conditions for inevitable victory. This is the major task that we practically put forward from the international situation.

The Essence of the Ikeda Cabinet

Speaking of domestic issues, the formation of the Ikeda Cabinet is a major event that has occurred since the Eleventh Plenary Session. This Ikeda Cabinet, although it is a so-called Kishi-style cabinet, is not simply inheriting the mantle of the Kishi Cabinet. The Ikeda Cabinet is entrusted by the Japanese monopoly capital group to realize their new ambitions. It is the political representative of the Japanese monopoly capital group in the current period, and the Japanese monopoly capital group in the current period is colluding with and subordinate to American imperialism on the one hand, and on the other hand, is once again more actively putting forward the policy of reviving imperialism and militarism. We believe that first of all, we must recognize that the Ikeda Cabinet is an important enemy that we must be especially vigilant against and struggle against.

However, in light of the experience and lessons of the Kishi Cabinet's failure, the Ikeda Cabinet is adopting some different methods from the Kishi Cabinet. While clearly understanding their essence, it is important to clearly recognize the characteristics of their strategies.

Just looking at some of the policies that the Ikeda Cabinet has already announced, it is also clear that their primary mission is to strive to re-actively implement the Japan-US military alliance. They express this intention with sayings such as regaining the trust of the United States, uniting with various "free countries," and refusing to implement a policy of neutrality. In fact, they are actively preparing to establish the Japan-US Security Consultative Committee and other institutions stipulated in the exchange of letters attached to the new Security Treaty to strive to implement the new military alliance. It is said that a military expert committee will also be established in this committee. Although they are considering to some extent whether to concretely and publicly propose militaristic policies again for the sake of the election, we must never forget that actually implementing this line is the primary mission of this cabinet.

Second, Prime Minister Ikeda has long been an active promoter of trade liberalization and active expansion into Southeast Asia. In essence, he is implementing a policy of promoting the rationalization of capitalism in the above-mentioned direction, giving great blows to small and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture while safeguarding the interests of monopoly organizations.

The third is the so-called "security countermeasure." They put on a disguise of "soothing administrative measures," saying that they are not prepared to revise the "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" for the time being, and will not formulate special security laws, and so on. However, in essence, this cabinet is a militaristic cabinet loyal to American imperialism. This can be seen at a glance by looking at the brutal attacks it launched on the Hagerty issue. They attached great importance to this issue and intended to use this issue to attack the Communist Party and split the democratic forces. After the formation of the cabinet, they immediately conducted illegal searches, suppression, and investigations of the Party's organization.

Overall, the Ikeda Cabinet's attempt is to curb and stop the rise of the struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and maintain democracy, to strike and split the combatant parts and leadership parts of the democratic movement, to make the election favorable to itself, and to further restore the trust of the United States. The Ikeda Cabinet is essentially a cabinet that most faithfully revives imperialism and militarism. In this sense, it cannot be said that it is better than the Kishi Cabinet. It must be regarded as a more cunning representative lackey of the monopoly capital group, and we must do our best to fight against it. This is an issue that the democratic forces today should fully recognize.

The Background of the Ikeda Cabinet's Economic Policy

The Ikeda Cabinet is using the current "good times" of the Japanese economy to deceive the people. Indeed, the current Japanese economy shows that productivity has increased the most since the war. But this is the result of the monopoly capital group intensifying the exploitation and plunder of the working class and the people, and recklessly implementing enterprise rationalization, thereby accumulating capital. This can be seen from the following facts: even in the "best of times," the number of unemployed and underemployed people still reaches 7.12 million, and people with annual incomes below 160,000 yen still account for 52% of wage-earning laborers.

On the other hand, the profits of monopoly capitalists have increased. From October 1959 to March 1960, the operating profits of 180 monopoly enterprises reached 291 billion yen, an increase of 25% compared with the previous half-year; 40% more than the peak period of the "Jinmu Boom." Although the Ikeda Cabinet also says that it will reduce taxes, it is actually mainly considering reducing the tax on corporate profits. Further increasing the capital accumulation of monopoly capitalists, while actively importing American capital through the liberalization of trade and exchange rates is their important line in the above direction. Obviously, this is to intensify the domestic plunder policy, implement imperialist expansion in regions centered on Southeast Asia, and control the basic industrial sectors and "emerging industrial sectors" by accumulating and strengthening monopoly capital and importing American capital, strengthening the dual exploitation of Japanese and American monopoly capital. Monopoly capitalists have begun to use the liberalization of trade and exchange rates as an excuse to launch a new "rationalization" offensive, implementing wage reductions, layoffs, factory closures, outsourcing to small factories, and lowering unit prices. In addition, they are also preparing to launch a new attack on farmers. Since last year, American investment groups have visited Japan one after another. American investment in Japan in the past year was twice as much as the previous year.

The central task of the struggle in the future is to combine the struggle for independence, peace, and neutrality that we have consistently pointed out in the struggle to prevent the revision of the Security Treaty with the struggle to defend the people's lives and protect the people from the exploitation and plunder of American imperialism and the Japanese monopoly capital group.

(II)

The Role of the Party in the Struggle against the Japan-US "Security Treaty"

The basic significance of the provisional summary made by the Eleventh Plenary Session on the struggle against the "Security Treaty" will not be explained in detail here. The decision pointed out the following three central issues regarding the achievements of the struggle: In the course of that struggle, the Japan-US military alliance was dealt a heavy blow, creating conditions for the abolition of the treaty; the Kishi Cabinet was forced to step down; Eisenhower's visit to Japan was prevented; and the issue of driving the U-2 plane out of Japan can also be added.

The decision emphasized that the reason for these achievements was not just the efforts of one party or faction, but the people's solidarity, which is a form of united front at present, in the central and local joint struggle organizations established during this struggle.

We must see the future of maintaining and further strengthening the people's solidarity and the united front with this confidence. We are convinced that our Party has played an active role in various strategic issues such as clearly pointing out the two enemies and mass action in this year and a half, especially in the recent half year of struggle.

For example, the issue of opposing Eisenhower's visit to Japan is very clear from the essence of the Japan-US military alliance and the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty." Eisenhower was clearly coming as an opponent and destroyer of Japan's peace and independence. The entire democratic force has a clear understanding of this issue after the U-2 spy plane incident. Our Party has explained this issue through "Akahata" editorials and other methods since around March 10. In the process of the development of the situation and the struggle of the democratic force, the action against Eisenhower's visit to Japan was finally affirmed as the direction of the joint struggle.

We have also made concrete efforts on the signature movement and the national strike to make them both practical and powerful actions. This effort has also achieved certain successes.

In these struggles, the Party has paid special attention to consistently carrying out the struggle on two fronts, on the one hand, fighting against the sectarianism from the right wing that attempts to actually turn the "National Council" into an agency run by one party and one faction, and on the other hand, fighting against the provocations and splitting activities of Trotskyist elements who play with left-wing rhetoric and attempt to sell out the struggle to the enemy.

The Trotskyist Problem and the Role of the Vanguard Party

Regarding the issue of June 15, a part of the Trotskyist elements took the lead in adopting a strategy of breaking into the National Diet on that day. Obviously, this strategy was not only not the policy determined by the "National Council," but also violated the discipline of the "National Council." The reactionary authorities carried out such suppression, someone was sacrificed, and the authorities also subjected the university professors who rushed to the scene because they were worried about accidents to violence. This suppression is an extremely serious illegal brutal act. Facing this situation, the Party adopted the attitude of protesting by focusing on the illegal suppression of the Kishi Cabinet, as everyone knows.

On the 18th, the Trotskyists (Communist League) and some other forces, together, adopted a strategy of breaking into the National Diet again, and even made concrete preparations. The government had long been preparing to take the opportunity to carry out a thorough suppression. If the main force of the democratic force took action with the Trotskyists, that would be exactly what they wanted.

It is very clear what the consequences would be if the tactics taken by the Trotskyists on the 18th were used. Because the Party had a clear judgment on the events of the 15th, it was able to clearly point out from beginning to end in the struggle on the 18th that the strategy of breaking into the National Diet again was a purposeless and reckless adventure that risked the destruction of the main force of the democratic force.

However, it is impossible to recognize the above problems if there is ambiguity in the fundamental view of the situation.

This issue must be considered in connection with the shortcomings of the entire struggle.

The Liberal Democratic Party, as the ruling party and the monopoly capital party, occupies nearly two-thirds of the seats in the National Diet. This is the result of the election two years ago. As the counterattack of the democratic force in the struggle against the "Security Treaty" became increasingly intense, confusion and wavering arose within the Liberal Democratic Party. But from the situation in the countryside and other aspects, the influence of reactionary rule is still deeply rooted. They have suppression agencies that support their political rule - the army of American imperialism and the Self-Defense Forces, and the firepower of the Self-Defense Forces has far exceeded that of the pre-war Japanese army. They also have the capital power to control newspapers, radios and other propaganda agencies with circulations of tens of millions to maintain their fundamental interests. In terms of the economic foundation, they control capital in a highly monopolized stage.

The current situation of the democratic force is that, although more than one-third of the workers have been organized, there are still anti-communist and splittist forces such as "Zenro" and "Shin-Sanbetsu" among them. The organized working class itself has not yet well armed itself with the ideology of the united front. From the current situation of the "National Council," the two core parties, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, have not yet directly established a relationship of joint struggle. The Socialist Party has repeatedly stated that cooperation with the Communist Party in democratic groups is to defeat the Communist Party in the struggle. This is a major obstacle to strengthening the "National Council" - the united front. This weakness is also the reason why important issues in unified action have not been resolved quickly.

Our Party has gone all out to fight to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and has strived to make the possibility of preventing the revision a reality. For this reason, we have strived to achieve the unity of the people, adhered to a consistent unified action that is both combative and flexible based on the correct goals, and have formulated various strategies for unified action. This work has made considerable progress and achievements as we have seen. However, in this year and a half, we have not developed to the point of fundamentally changing the balance of power, nor have we been able to fundamentally overcome the weaknesses within the democratic force, to create conditions for the Socialist Party and the Communist Party to carry out direct joint struggles.

In this case, although there are demonstrations with 200,000 to 300,000 people participating, if we look at it as a political force, it should be said that there are politically and ideologically insufficiently unified weaknesses in how to recognize the enemy and whether to regard these actions as a united front. Even if a march of 200,000 to 300,000 people is superior to two or three thousand police; it can mobilize them to occupy the National Diet for several hours, but under today's balance of power, it still cannot fundamentally guarantee the victory of the democratic force. On the contrary, it will only bring about the enemy's thorough suppression, bring the democratic force into a long period of suffering, and lead to adventurist errors. It is clear that although there was a climax, it did not develop into a revolutionary situation.

As mentioned above, the Party has basically carried out correct leadership during this period based on the balance of power of the entire struggle. Although the enemy launched a new suppression in this struggle, generally speaking, most of the democratic forces have preserved their strength. Although there are many problems, the current situation is that they are able to meet new struggles in the future. We must believe in the meaning of the struggle of the Party and the democratic forces, overcome weaknesses with confidence, truly strengthen the united front, and therefore strengthen the Party.

Prospects for Future Struggles and the United Front

Our Party has put forward a program of common demands for the current democratic forces. This program includes a series of views such as not recognizing and abolishing the "Security Treaty," crushing the Japan-US military alliance, restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations, safeguarding the lives of people of all strata, and establishing a democratic coalition government. The issue of correctly combining the daily struggles actually carried out in order to realize the current common demands with the prospect of establishing a democratic coalition government is extremely important in future struggles or elections.

An important issue in the Ikeda Cabinet's election strategy is to give the people an illusion that relying on the Liberal Democratic Party government will lead to a good life in terms of economic policy. Although both the common demand program and the government issue are centered on opposing the "Security Treaty," the task of opposing the plunder of the US-Japan monopoly capital group to safeguard the lives of people of all strata and safeguard daily interests should not be neglected in the slightest. Although the struggle against the "Security Treaty" has been so high, from the election experience in Saitama, Aomori, and Gunma, it can be seen that, especially in the countryside (and in some similar situations in the cities), the broad masses have not fully understood the real consequences that the "Security Treaty" can cause. Therefore, the issue of fully combining these two aspects is the issue of whether the Party's policies can truly be supported by the masses in future elections.

Among the political goals, the direction of not recognizing and abolishing the "Security Treaty" today has become the direction of the entire fighting democratic force. Specifically, this is the issue of launching a struggle against the enemy who is going to impose the Japan-US military alliance on the people in fact, and launching an offensive against the people by implementing administrative agreements and other measures. At the same time, as a policy of actively striving for peace, restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations and concluding a Japan-Soviet peace treaty have important significance. In terms of economic policy, it is necessary to oppose policies that serve US-Japan monopoly capital, point out the path to peacefully and independently prospering the Japanese economy, and at the same time focus efforts on dealing with issues such as trade, exchange liberalization, and the Basic Law on Agriculture.

The prerequisite for realizing the current common demands is the united front. Based on the gains of the struggle against the "Security Treaty," making the working class and the broad masses of the Japanese people accept this ideology of the united front is a very important key to promoting the advancement of the entire struggle and carrying out election work.

The recent "Sohyo" conference put forward the saying that the united struggle in our country has not yet formed into a united front, and that the prerequisites for a united front have not yet appeared in Japan. Regrettably, this view is still the guiding ideology of the main force of the Japanese labor movement. It is true that the current situation of the united struggle in Japan has not yet formed a solid national democratic united front like the one we are talking about, nor has it formed a solid united front in which the participating parties truly cooperate with each other. However, centering on the most important issue of the country, preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty," and the issue of striving for peace and independence, more than one hundred and several dozen groups have participated in the central government, launching unified actions for more than a year and a half, and more than two thousand local joint struggle organizations have also been established. This is the situation of people's unity that no capitalist country in the world has. Today, people who are fighting in all countries of the world are saying: to learn from this struggle in Japan; the source of the achievements of the struggle in Japan is the existence of this unity.

At this time, are we going to take the position that this unity is not yet a united front, and that the prerequisites for realizing a united front have not yet appeared, or are we going to take the position of admitting that there are insufficient places, but believing that this is a united front unique to Japan, and to further enrich this united front? On this issue, our Party has been frankly putting forward its own views. In the labor movement where the remnants of anti-communism are very deep, although this cannot be understood all at once, the task of the Communist Party is to always and consistently enrich the major lessons learned from this historically significant struggle theoretically and ideologically, and make it a weapon of people's unity. We are deeply convinced that despite various twists and turns and difficulties, this ideology of the united front will eventually be supported by the broad masses of workers and people in our country both theoretically and politically.

Current Tasks of the Labor Movement

Organized workers - "Sohyo" and neutral system unions - played a core role in the united struggle. However, there are also serious weaknesses. For example, in a certain large steel company in Kansai, after the Hagerty struggle, the executive organization of the union began to declare that it would not hold struggles against US imperialism at all. At the same time, when the enemy launched an offensive under the pretext of the Hagerty issue, there was also counter-propaganda in the union such as "being fooled by the Communist Party." However, the more this is the case, the more necessary it is to thoroughly expose the role of US imperialism in the world and its relationship with our country, and regarding the policies of the monopoly capital group itself, we must expose what kind of position they are taking to collude with the United States, and what kind of position they are taking to try to take the road of imperialism and militarism themselves; at the same time, we must fight against them. Only after clarifying these two enemies can we establish a real struggle system for workers against the trade liberalization issue and the rationalization issue.

The current problems of the labor movement include tasks such as opposing the rationalization of capitalists, demanding wage increases and shorter working hours, striving to establish a minimum wage system and social insurance, as well as struggles for the freedom of trade union activities and the right to strike and other current important economic and social demands. At the same time, as a party, we also have the task of carrying out consistent struggles in large enterprises, and at the same time, we must actively strive to organize the vast number of unorganized workers in small and medium-sized factories, improve the leadership ability of the Communist Party branches in the enterprises, advance in comprehensive policies, and at the same time lay the organizational foundation.

Regarding the struggle of the workers at the Miike Coal Mine, we have been attaching importance to it ever since the Sixth Plenary Session pointed out that the struggle against the "Security Treaty" should be combined with the struggle against rationalization.

In this struggle, the Miike workers shattered the slander that a large-scale strike could no longer be carried out after the so-called second trade union was formed. On the contrary, they confirmed such an experience, that is to say, if we increasingly strengthen the unity with the broad democratic forces, defend our rights, and make the struggle not only limited to the scope of the enterprise, but expand it into the struggle of the entire democratic forces, then, despite the weakness of the existence of the second trade union, we can still combine with the rising tide of the struggle against the "Security Treaty," organize a very tenacious and long-term struggle, create a situation where the Mitsui monopoly capital group cannot do whatever it wants, and be able to give the enemy a great blow.

The Problems of Farmers and Cultural Figures

Regarding the problems of agriculture and farmers, the Central Committee is now preparing to concretize the policies of the Congress based on the situation after the closing of the Congress and the situation of class differentiation, and is scheduled to be announced soon. This is extremely important for strengthening the Party's activities in the countryside (which was an important weakness in the struggle against the "Security Treaty"). At the same time, this is also extremely important at a time when the enemy is about to launch a new offensive on issues such as trade liberalization and the Basic Law on Agriculture.

We must study the farmer problem from the standpoint of the contradiction between American imperialism, Japanese monopoly capital and the Japanese people (which is the basic contradiction). Therefore, it is necessary to adopt the fundamental policy of strengthening the united front against the two enemies and its foundation, the worker-peasant alliance. The rich peasants, as exploiters, have class contradictions and antagonistic relations with the poor peasants. The rich peasants themselves often fall behind in price struggles and other struggles, and at the same time, the rich peasants often play the role of active running dogs of the reactionary ruling group or the Liberal Democratic Party in reality. If we do not carry out struggles centered on the poor peasants and middle peasants, the struggle in the countryside cannot truly develop, and this has become an important task in strengthening rural work.

If we do not attach importance to relying on the poor peasants, forming an alliance with the middle peasants, and defending their interests in the struggle, we cannot develop the struggle comprehensively. Regarding the rich peasants, on the one hand, we must see the possibility of carrying out necessary unity and cooperation with them to oppose the offensive and plunder of the US-Japan ruling group, but at the same time, we must fight them when they play a reactionary role; in the struggle for rural democratization and other struggles, the struggles and organizations of the poor peasants and middle peasants, especially the poor peasants, must play a core role. From this point of view, we must rapidly and leap forward expand the Party and the democratic force in the struggles and organizations in the countryside according to the current situation of class differentiation, which becomes the starting point of the policy.

The second is the issue of cultural figures. The unprecedentedly broad and active participation of cultural figures and intellectuals in this struggle is of great significance. Our Party must first give a high evaluation to this kind of development of the enthusiasm of all cultural figures. Moreover, we will still concentrate their energy as a wing of the united action against the "Security Treaty" and defending democracy in the future. This is in the interests of all the people. Even if various existing cultural figures organizations do not necessarily immediately participate in the "National Council," as a whole, we must strive to organically unite them as part of the joint struggle organization.

As a whole, in this struggle, several thousand university professors and people who have almost never expressed opinions on political issues have played an active role in participating in rallies and demonstrations. Evaluating this enthusiasm as an important part of the precious energy of the Japanese people, giving intellectuals greater and greater encouragement with such an evaluation, and clearly pointing out that intellectuals can only realize their demands by combining with the united front centered on the working class, striving to develop and strengthen the united front of the broad masses of the people, this is the basic direction.

The Correct Direction of Development of the "National Council"

Now the direction of development of the "National Council" has become a problem. Our Party has already published suggestions in this regard, so I will not repeat them. Recently, the Socialist Party published a policy of abolishing the "Security Treaty"; on important issues, our Party and the Socialist Party are consistent. However, judging from the Socialist Party's "Explanation of Political Policies" and other documents on the Communist Party, we still need to strive for the implementation of the policy of cooperation between the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and "Sohyo" on an equal footing, which is a prerequisite for strengthening the united front, and is also the demand put forward as early as January 17. Despite the various difficulties that still exist, the actual situation of people's unity reflected in the two thousand national and local joint struggle organizations shows that there is now a broad force of unity that cannot be denied by the policies of one side.

Now, in order to absorb the participation of the National Federation of Industrial Unions ("Shin-Sanbetsu") and the All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions ("Zenro"), some people have put forward the suggestion of "dissolving the National Council in order to develop." However, no matter what the name is, if we want to take the policy of turning this joint struggle organization into an empty shell in name only or canceling it, then the people who take this policy will only deviate from the direction of unity of the Japanese democratic force. The strength of the Japanese people has at least made such progress in the struggle against the Security Treaty. We must move forward tenaciously with a policy that is both principled and flexible. Of course, there are various ideological and political differences between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, but in fact, they are consistent in the important direction of abolishing the "Security Treaty," and there are many common points in restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations and other aspects. We believe that if we well affirm this consistent place, and strengthen cooperation in reality based on this consistent place, in order to increasingly strengthen unity, then even if we carry out necessary mutual criticism, there are still conditions to achieve the correct development of the people's joint struggle organization.

As a whole, "Sohyo" played a very active role in the united struggle in that situation. Moreover, in reality, our Party and "Sohyo," as a whole, have been advancing in a friendly relationship. When "Sohyo" held a congress, our Party also put forward opinions on the proposals, especially from the standpoint of the unity of the democratic force, clarified what it meant to support the Socialist Party.

Obviously, we are not

    以大选为目标，加强统一战线，扩大党！
    日本共产党总书记宫本显治在日共全国积极分子会议上的报告摘要
    编者按：日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”在8月14日以“为了贯彻执行十一中全会的决定”“让我们以大选为目标，加强统一战线，扩大党！”为题，发表了日本共产党总书记宫本显治在从8月3日至5日于东京举行的日本共产党全国积极分子会议上所作的报告和总结。现将报告摘要发表如下：
    自从十一中全会的决定发表以后，各地正在积极地组织讨论和贯彻执行这项决定。在县委员长会议和后来举行的各条战线部长会议以及其它活动，我们也可以肯定，全党的情况是这样的：这项决定得到压倒多数党员的支持，而且，多数党员都热心地要贯彻执行这个决定。在这个重要的阶段，我们进一步统一意志，组织今后的大斗争，特别是竞选斗争，实现党的跃进，这不仅是共产党的重要任务，而且在保持我们和民主力量一道建立起来的团结—统一战线并且进一步加以发展方面，也是极其重要的。我想在这样一些问题上，按照那项决定的整个精神，谈谈自从那项决定发表以后出现的一些情况，就必要的问题提出报告。
                （一）
                国　际　形　势
      首先是国际形势问题。修改“安全条约”本身就是美国帝国主义和日本垄断资本集团这两个敌人对日本人民发动的进攻，就是对世界和平的进攻。在这个意义上说，反对“安全条约”的斗争，同最近的国际形势联系起来看，起了重要的作用。在这个期间，特别发生了这一系列的事件：南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争，这场斗争引起的李承晚政府的崩溃，U—2型间谍飞机事件，东西方首脑会议的没有开成。这些事件对日本的斗争也产生了重大的影响。美帝国主义者在这个期间，自从赫鲁晓夫总理访美以后，一面采取同意会谈的姿态，一面一贯继续执行侵略政策。
    为什么美帝国主义采取总算是同意会谈的姿态呢？在我们党内也有一些人有过这样的看法：“美帝国主义本质上不是也有过和平的一面
  吗？”但是，我们党同莫斯科宣言的分析完全一致，一向认为美帝国主义的本质并没有变。从这一点出发，譬如，关于艾森豪威尔访日问题，远在U—2型间谍飞机事件发生以前，我们就认为他的访日之行的最根本的作用是阻碍亚洲的和平以及日本的和平和独立，因而明确地表示了反对的意见。
    国际形势和国内形势的发展证实了我们党的这些看法完全正确。美国所以采取总算同意同苏联会谈的姿态，是因为：
    第一，社会主义各国的和平政策越来越得到广大群众的拥护，特别是苏联无论在军事上或者在科学上都占了美帝国主义的上风。因此，美国的实力政策没有取得多大效果这一点，不得不在某种程度上暴露于全世界人民的面前。
    第二，世界各国人民反对殖民主义和战争的斗争一天比一天高涨。正如古巴的解放斗争所显示的那样，全世界的民族解放和和平的力量有了进展。
    第三，美国的地位在国际上相对地削弱了，同时，帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾，譬如英美间的矛盾也加深了；在对苏政策方面，美国也难于继续执行杜勒斯之流的政策。
    力量对比的这些变化和它们内部的矛盾，是美帝国主义一面在根本上继续采取战争和侵略政策，一面不得不借赫鲁晓夫总理访美的机会采取总算同意举行首脑会议和会谈这个方向的主要原因。
    而且，即使在U—2型飞机不断进行间谍活动达四年之久这件事情暴露出来以后，美帝国主义还一味把开不成首脑会议的责任推到苏联方面去。最近，美国的两大政党举行了大会。在共和党大会的主旨演说中，周以德强调说，赢得冷战是至高无上的要求。民主党方面虽然抨击政府，可是也清楚地说出了不同意中国加入联合国的路线。关于日本人民的斗争，他们也一贯攻击共产党，说什么那是国际共产主义的阴谋呀，那是日本少数的共产主义者的阴谋呀，等等。
    但是，他们采取这种政策决不是由于他们的力量强大了，而是由于尽管他们的整个力量相对地削弱了，但是只要他们一天是帝国主义者，就一天也要继续采取侵略和战争的政策。针对这种情况，各国人民正在越来越顽强地继续进行争取和平和独立的斗争，反对那些帝国主义者的冷战政策。我国人民虽然还没有取得全面的胜利，可是，已经在这场斗争中给了两个敌人以很大的打击。不消说，这对世界和平也作了很大的贡献。
    最近，在意大利，在英国，总之，在那些有美帝国主义者基地的地方，反对基地的斗争正在加强。此外，在古巴，针对天天发展的民族解放和民主革命，美国政府正在进行恫吓，要进行经济封锁或者干涉。但是，苏联表明了这样的态度：假如美国实行武装干涉，就坚决予以应得的回击。
    美国曾经扼杀了危地马拉的斗争。从那时候的情况来看今天，我们可以看到，全世界社会主义以及民族解放、和平力量的进展所带来的有利形势，大大地鼓舞着古巴的民主革命的前进。刚果据说是非洲的模范的殖民地，在八十年间受了典型的殖民地的痛苦。在这个刚果，比利时虽然给予了形式上的独立，但是，实际上却采取了维持它的殖民主义的特权的政策，因此，发生了很大的民族斗争。
    在各国人民斗争获得进展的同时，社会主义各国在首脑会议没有开成以后仍然一贯继续采取和平政策。苏联政府6月3日再次提出关于全面裁军的新建议。这说明，苏联政府衷心希望世界和平，希望首脑会议开成，即使在这次会议由于U—2型间谍飞机事件而遭到破坏以后，仍然忠实地继续采取和平共处政策。
    其次，8月1日，中国的周恩来总理在瑞士国庆日招待会上建议亚洲和包括美国在内的太平洋沿岸各国签订一个互不侵犯的和平公约，把这整个地区建成为没有核武器的地区。这件事情，针对帝国主义者说什么中国不想和平共处的反宣传，向全世界证明了：中华人民共和国在与亚洲各国签订了一系列的和平友好条约，正在奉行和平五项原则的同时，还提出为了亚洲和平的积极的建议。
    在这个期间举行的世界和平理事会常务委员会和理事会会议、目前在日本召开的禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的举行，证明世界的和平力量在明确指出和平的敌人的同时，还根据能够赢得和平的坚强信心，正在加强世界和平力量的团结。
    不久以前，社会主义各国的共产党、工人党出席罗马尼亚共产党代表大会的代表，在布加勒斯特再次确认了1957年的莫斯科宣言，确认了这篇宣言包含的重要论点、防止战争的可能性、但是只要帝国主义者还存在就有战争的危险，因而不应该放松警惕而必须为和平而斗争的问题、还有和平或非和平的革命过渡问题，等等重要的命题。
    我们在前天举行的中央委员会第十二次全体会议上通过了表示完全拥护这项布加勒斯特宣言的决议。我们不仅拥护它，而且可以说，我们在反对“安全条约”的斗争中一面清清楚楚地认识到美帝国主义是全世界反动势力的中心（莫斯科宣言也说明了这一点），一面一贯继续进行争取和平和独立的斗争，和日本人民一道，对世界和平以及日本的独立和自由作了很大的贡献。
    不消说，马克思列宁主义在其基本原则方面，是严格地捍卫在世界共产主义运动中无论在理论上或者在实践中都已经明确了的各个原则，在同左右的偏向进行斗争中一天天发展着的。因此，今天，在新的形势之下，各国共产党在各自竭尽全力完成自己的任务的过程中，当然要自己努力去发展马克思列宁主义。
    各国的党是按照自己国家的形势和任务，在理论上和实践中特别发展那些论点中的必需部分的。我们从对本国的运动负责的立场出发，正在为马克思列宁主义的发展而努力。
    同时，当然，既然它是建立在科学基础上的东西，全世界的共产主义者在基本的国际形势、各个革命原则方面，当然是能够经常在根本上取得一致的。我们即使在有了各种问题的情况下，也必须不断从根本上去维护基于马克思列宁主义原则的一致的本质；也可以这样说：必须一面像保护眼睛那样去保护它，一面反对一切偏向，维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，并且加以发展。
    因此，我们认为，我们在大力支持世界共产主义运动朝着莫斯科宣言的路线的方向加强团结、向前发展的同时，有责任在这种互相团结的基础上，为马克思列宁主义在日本的创造性的发展和日本人民的解放而竭尽全力。
    上述国际形势告诉我们：不断壮大的社会主义阵营、和平力量、民族解放力量、人民的民主力量正在一天天加强自己的力量；相反地，帝国主义阵营矛盾日趋尖锐，尽管它的侵略政策正在破产，但是它仍然把冷战作为至高无上的要求，死抱着冷战不放，向人类进步与和平的方向挑战。
    但是，他们将来决不会取得胜利；由于他们同世界上的进步潮流背道而驰，一定终于在全世界，在各个国家里失败。我们是越来越坚定地加强这样的信心的。在进行了反对“安全条约”的斗争的今天，虽然在我们的前面还有许多困难，但是，我们必须以这样的坚强的信心来为日本人民斗争的团结而全力以赴：我们的斗争是沿着全世界进步和正义的道路前进的斗争，它具有必然胜利的条件。这就是我们从国际形势中在实践上提出来的重大的任务。
              池田内阁的本质
    以国内的问题来说，池田内阁的成立是十一中全会以后发生的大事件。这个池田内阁，虽然是所谓岸式内阁，但是它不仅仅单纯地继承岸内阁的衣钵。池田内阁是接受日本垄断资本集团的委托要去实现他们的新野心的、日本垄断资本集团在目前这个时期的政治代表，而日本垄断资本集团在目前这个时期一面同美帝国主义勾结，从属于它，一面又重新更加积极地提出复活帝国主义和军国主义的方针。我们认为，首先必须认识到，池田内阁是我们必须特别提高警惕来对它进行斗争的重要敌人。
    但是，池田内阁鉴于岸内阁的经验和失败的教训，正在采取着同岸内阁有些不同的手法。在明确地了解他们的本质的同时，清楚地认识他们的策略的特点，是重要的。
    单就池田内阁今天已经宣布的一些政策来看，也显然可以看出他们的首要的使命是努力重新积极地实施日美军事同盟。他们用所谓重新获得美国的信任、同各“自由国家”团结、拒绝执行中立政策这样一些说法表现了他们的这种意图。实际上，他们正在积极准备成立那项新安全条约所附来往信件等所明文规定要组织的日美保障安全协商委员会等机构，来努力实施新的军事同盟。据说，在这个委员会里，还要设立军事专门委员会。他们为了竞选，虽然在某种程度上正在考虑是否重新具体地公然提出军国主义的政策，但是，我们一刻也不应当忘记，实际上，执行这条路线是这个内阁的首要的使命。
      第二，池田首相老早就是积极促进贸易自由化、积极向东南亚扩张的人。在本质上，他正在执行这样的政策：按照上述方向，推进资本主义的合理化，在维护垄断组织的利益的情况下，给中小企业和农业以很大的打击。
    第三是所谓“治安对策”。他们披上了所谓“安抚人心的行政措施”  这样一种伪装，说什么目前不准备改坏“警察官职务执行法”，不制订特殊的治安法律，等等。但是，从本质上说，这个内阁是一个效忠于美帝国主义的军国主义内阁。这一点，只要看一看它在那个哈格蒂问题上进行的残暴的进攻也可以一目了然。他们非常重视这个问题，并且抱着利用这个问题来攻击共产党、分裂民主力量的意图，在内阁成立以后就立刻对党的组织进行了非法的搜查、镇压、追究。
      整个说来，池田内阁的企图是：抑制阻止修改“安全条约”和维护民主的斗争高涨，打击、分裂民主运动的战斗部分和领导部分，使选举对自己有利，以便进一步恢复美国的信任。池田内阁本质上是一个最忠实地复活帝国主义、军国主义的内阁，从这一点来说，不能说它比岸内阁好，要认为它是垄断资本集团更加狡猾的有代表性的走狗，必须竭尽全力去对它斗争。这是民主力量今天应当充分认识到的问题。
          池田内阁经济政策的背景
    池田内阁正在利用今天日本经济的“好光景”这一情况来欺骗人民。的确，目前日本的经济显示出生产力有了战后最大的增长的情况。但这是垄断资本集团对工人阶级和人民加紧实行敲骨吸髓的剥削和掠夺，不顾一切地实行企业合理化，因而积累了资本的结果。这一点，可以从下列事实中看出来：就在“光景最好”的时候，失业和半失业人数仍然达到七百一十二万人，每年收入在十六万日元以下的人仍然占赚工资的劳动者的52％。
    另一方面，垄断资本家的利润都增加了。自1959年10月至1960年3月，一百八十家垄断企业的营业利润达到二千九百一十亿日元，竟比上一个半年增加了25％；比“神武景气”的顶点时期还多40％。池田内阁虽然也说要减税，但是实际上主要是考虑减少对法人利润的课税。进一步增加垄断资本家的资本积累，同时通过贸易和汇兑的自由化积极地输入美国资本这一个方向，就是他们的重要的路线。
    但是，在目前的“好光景”中，钢铁和耐久性消费资料的生产部门已经出现了局部的生产过剩，景气已经出现停滞的情况。政府和垄断资本家正在企图通过贸易和汇兑的自由化，以及加强“日美经济合作”的办法来解决尖锐化了的市场问题。显然，这就是要一方面加紧执行国内的掠夺政策，向以东南亚为中心的地区实行帝国主义的扩张，同时用积聚并且加强垄断资本、输入美国资本等办法来控制基础工业部门和“新兴工业部门”，加强日美垄断资本的双重剥削。垄断资本家已经开始利用贸易和汇兑的自由化作为发动新的“合理化”攻势的借口，实行减少工资、解雇、关闭工厂、委托小厂加工、降低单价。此外，还准备对农民发动新的进攻。去年以来，美国的对日投资团相继访问日本。去年度美国对
  日投资等于上一年的两倍。
    今后斗争的中心任务就是，把我们在阻止修改安全条约的斗争中所一贯指出的争取独立、和平、中立的斗争，同保卫人民生活、使人民免受美帝国主义和日本垄断资本集团的剥削和掠夺的斗争结合起来。
                （二）
  党在反对日美“安全条约”斗争中所起的作用
    关于十一中全会就反对“安全条约”斗争所作的临时总结的基本意义，这里不再详细说明了。全会的决定就斗争的成就指出了如下三个中心问题：在那次斗争的过程中，给了日美军事同盟以沉重的打击，为废除条约创造了条件；迫使岸内阁下了台；阻止了艾森豪威尔访日；还可以加上把U—2型飞机赶出日本这一个问题。
    决定强调指出，取得这些成就的原因不仅仅是一党一派的努力，而是在这次斗争期间建立起来的中央和地方的联合斗争组织，即当前作为统一战线的一种形式的人民的团结。
    我们必须本着这种信心看到今后可以保持和进一步加强人民的团结和统一战线的前途。我们确信，我们党在这一年半期间，特别是在最近半年的斗争中，在明确指出两个敌人的问题和群众行动等各种策略问题上都起了积极的作用。
    例如反对艾森豪威尔访日这个问题，从日美军事同盟和反对修改“安全条约”斗争的本质看来，是非常清楚的。艾森豪威尔显然是作为日本的和平和独立的反对者和破坏者而来的。对于这个问题，在U—2型间谍飞机事件发生之后，整个民主力量都有了明确的认识。我们党从3月10日前后起，就通过“赤旗报”社论和其他办法说明了这个问题。在形势的发展和民主力量的斗争过程中，反对艾森豪威尔访日的行动终于被肯定为联合斗争的方向。
    在签名运动和全国性罢工问题上，我们也作了具体的努力，使它们成为既切实可行又具有威力的行动。这种努力也取得了一定的成就。
    在这些斗争中，党特别注意的是一贯地进行了两条战线的斗争这一点，一方面对来自右面的、企图使“国民会议”实际上变成为一党一派承办机关的宗派主义进行斗争，另一方面又对玩弄左派言辞、企图把斗争出卖给敌人的托派分子的挑衅和分裂活动进行了斗争。
          托派问题和先锋党的作用
    关于6月15日的问题，当天有一部分托派分子带头采取了闯进国会的策略，显然，这种策略不但不是“国民会议”确定的方针，而且违反了“国民会议”的纪律。反动当局进行那样的镇压，有人牺牲了，而且当局还对那些担心发生意外事情而赶到现场的大学教授施加暴行，这种镇压是极其严重的非法的残暴行为。面对这种情况，党采取了把重点放在岸内阁非法镇压这一方面而提出抗议的态度，这是大家知道的。
    在18日当天，托派（共产主义者同盟）和其他一些势力一道采取了再次闯进国会的策略，甚至作了具体的准备。政府早已在准备借机进行彻底的镇压，如果民主力量的主力同托派一致行动的话，那就是他们求之不得的事。
    如果为托派在18日采取的策略所利用，将会造成什么样的后果，那是很清楚的。由于党对15日的事件有明确的判断，所以在18日的斗争中，自始至终都能够明确地指出，再次闯进国会的策略，是冒着民主力量的主力会被毁灭的危险而采取的、没有目的而且轻率的冒险策略。
    但是，如果对形势的根本看法有不明确的地方，那就不可能认清上述问题。
    这个问题必须同整个斗争的缺点联系起来加以考虑。
    作为执政党和垄断资本政党的自由民主党在国会里占有将近三分之二的议席。这是两年前的选举结果。由于在反对“安全条约”的斗争中，民主力量的反击日益强烈，所以自由民主党内产生了混乱和动摇。但是从农村和其他方面的情况看来，反动统治的影响还是根深蒂固的。他们拥有支持他们政治统治的镇压机构——美帝国主义的军队和自卫队，而且自卫队的火力已经远远超过战前的日本军队。他们还有足以控制那些销路达几千万份的报纸、广播和其他宣传机关以维护他们的根本利益的资本力量。在经济基础方面，他们掌握了处在高度垄断阶段的资本。
    民主力量的现状是，虽然有三分之一以上的工人已经组织起来，但是其中还存在“全劳”、“新产别”之类的反共、分裂主义势力。有组织的工人阶级本身还没有很好地用统一战线的思想把自己武装起来。从“国民会议”的现状来看，作为核心的社、共两党还没有直接建立联合斗争的关系。社会党还反复声称，在民主团体中同共产党合作，是为了在斗争中战胜共产党。这是加强“国民会议”——统一战线方面的一个很大的障碍。这种弱点也是未能迅速地解决统一行动上的重要问题的原因。
    我们党已经全力以赴地为阻止修改“安全条约”而斗争，并且努力使阻止修改的可能性成为现实。为此，我们曾经努力争取实现人民的团结，根据正确的目标坚持了既有战斗性又有灵活性的、一贯的统一行动，并且为统一行动制订了各种的策略。这个工作已经取得了相当的进展和我们所看到的那样成就。但是，在这一年半内，我们还没有发展到足以从根本上改变力量对比的地步，也没有能够从根本上克服民主力量内部的弱点，为社、共两党进行直接的联合斗争创造条件。
    在这种情况下，尽管举行了有二、三十万人参加的示威游行，但如果把它作为一个政治力量来看，那么，应该说在如何认识敌人方面，在是否把这些行动看成是统一战线方面，都存在着政治上和思想上的不十分统一的弱点。二、三十万人的游行队伍即使比两三万警察占优势；可以发动他们把国会占领几个小时，但是，在今天的力量对比之下，仍然不能从根本上保证民主力量的胜利。相反地，只会带来敌人的彻底镇压，把民主力量带到长期痛苦的境地，导致冒险主义的错误，事情很明显，虽然出现了高潮，但是并没有发展成为革命的形势。
    如上所述，党在这期间根据整个斗争的力量对比，基本上进行了正确的领导。虽然在这个斗争中敌人发动了新的镇压，但是总的说来，大部分民主力量都保存了自己的力量，虽然存在着许多问题，但是目前的情况是，能够迎接今后的新的斗争。我们必须相信党和民主力量奋斗的意义，满怀信心地克服弱点，真正地加强统一战线，因此也就要加强党。
        对今后斗争的展望和统一战线
    我们党已经提出了关于当前民主力量的共同要求的纲领。这个纲领 包括不承认和废除“安全条约”，粉碎日美军事同盟，恢复日中邦交，维护各阶层人民的生活以及建立民主联合政府等一系列的观点。把为了实现当前的共同纲领性质的要求而实际进行的日常斗争和建立民主联合政府的前景正确地结合起来的问题，在今后的斗争或选举中都是极其重要的。
      池田内阁的选举策略中的重要课题就是给人民以一种幻想，使大家认为在经济政策方面依靠自由民主党政府就会过好生活。无论是共同要求纲领或政府的问题虽然都是以反对“安全条约”为中心，但是丝毫也不应当轻视反对美日垄断资本集团的掠夺以维护各阶层人民的生活问题，以及维护日常利益的任务。反对“安全条约”的斗争虽然如此高涨，但是从琦玉、青森和群马的选举经验中可以看出，特别是在农村（在城市中也有某些类似的情况），广大群众还没有充分地理解到“安全条约”所能造成的真正后果。因此，把这两个侧面充分地结合起来的问题，就是党的方针在今后的选举中能否真正地得到群众拥护的问题。
      在政治目标中，今天不承认和废除“安全条约”的方向，已经成为战斗的整个民主力量的方向。具体地说，这就是同事实上要把日美军事同盟强加于人民，实施行政协定及其他措施来对人民发动进攻的敌人展开斗争的问题。同时，作为积极地争取和平的方针，恢复日中邦交和缔结日苏和约有着重要的意义。在经济政策方面，必须反对为美日垄断资本服务的政策，指出和平地、自主地繁荣日本经济的道路，同时要倾注力量处理贸易、汇兑自由化和农业基本法等方面的问题。
    实现当前的共同要求的前提是统一战线。根据反对“安全条约”斗争的收获，使工人阶级和广大日本人民接受这个统一战线的思想，是促使整个斗争前进和展开选举工作的很重要的关键。
    最近召开的“总评”大会提出了这样的说法，即我国的联合斗争还没有形成为统一战线，在日本还没有出现统一战线的前提条件。遗憾的是，这种观点仍然是日本工人运动的主力部队的指导思想。不错，今天日本的联合斗争的情况，还没有形成像我们所说的那种牢靠的民族民主统一战线，也没有形成参加斗争的政党真正互相合作的巩固的统一战线。但是，以阻止修改“安全条约”这个国家最重要的问题和争取和平与独立的问题为中心，在中央已经有一百几十个团体参加，展开了长达一年半以上的统一行动，地方的联合斗争组织也建立了两千个以上。这是世界上任何资本主义国家都没有的人民团结的状况。今天，世界各国进行斗争的人民都在说：要向日本的这个斗争学习；日本的斗争取得成就的源泉，就是有了这种团结。
    在这个时候，我们要采取认为这种团结还不是统一战线，实现统一战线的前提还没有出现的立场呢，还是采取承认有不够的地方，但认为这是日本独有的统一战线，要进一步去充实这个统一战线的立场呢？在这
  个问题上我们党一直直率地提出了自己的观点。在反共主义的余孽很深的工人运动中，这一点虽然不可能一下子就被理解，但是，共产党的任务就是要始终一贯地从理论上和思想上来充实从这次具有历史意义的斗争中所取得的重大的经验教训，使之成为人民团结的武器。我们深信，尽管有种种的波折和困难，这个统一战线的思想，最后无论在理论上或政策上都必将获得我国广大工人和人民的拥护。
              当前工人运动的任务
    有组织的工人——“总评”和中立系统的工会在联合斗争中起了核心作用。但是，也还存在严重的弱点。例如在关西的某大炼钢公司等，在反对哈格蒂斗争以后，工会的执行机构开始宣称一概不举行对美帝国主义的斗争。同时，当敌人借口哈格蒂问题发动进攻的时候，在工会中也出现了诸如“上了共产党的当”之类的反宣传。但是，越是这样，越有必要彻底地揭露美帝国主义在世界上所起的作用以及和我国之间的关系，而且，关于垄断资本集团本身的政策，还要揭露他们是采取什么样的立场同美国勾结，又是采取什么样的立场企图自己走帝国主义和军国主义的道路的；同时，对他们进行斗争。只有明确这两个敌人以后，才能够建立工人反对贸易自由化问题、合理化问题的真正的斗争体制。
    当前工人运动的问题包括反对资本家的合理化、要求提高工资和缩短劳动时间、争取确立最低工资制和社会保险等任务，以及为争取工会活动的自由和罢工权而进行的斗争等等当前重要的经济和社会方面的要求。同时，作为党来说，还有这样的任务，即在大企业中进行一贯的斗争，同时，还要积极努力去组织广大的中小工厂中没有参加组织的工人，提高企业中共产党支部的领导能力，在全面性的政策方面前进，同时奠定组织基础。
    对于三池煤矿工人的斗争，我们从六中全会指出反对“安全条约”斗争要同反对合理化斗争相结合这一点出发，是一直予以重视的。
    三池工人在这场斗争中，粉碎了所谓第二工会组成以后就再也不能进行大罢工的谰言。相反地，他们证实了这样的一个经验，就是说，如果日益加强同广泛的民主力量的团结，保卫自己的权利，使斗争不只是限于企业的范围内，而把它扩大成为整个民主力量的斗争，那么，尽管存在第二工会的弱点，仍然是能够同反对“安全条约”斗争的高涨相结合，组织非常顽强而长期的斗争，造成一种使三井垄断资本集团不能为所欲为的情况，能够给敌人以很大的打击的。
            农民和文化界人士问题
    关于农业和农民问题，中央委员会现在正在根据大会闭幕后的形势和阶级分化情况，准备把大会的方针具体化，预定最近就可以公布。这对加强党在农村中的活动（这曾经是反对“安全条约”斗争的一个重要的弱点）是极其重要的。同时，在敌人要以贸易自由化和农业基本法等问题发起新的进攻的目前这个时候，这一点也显得极其重要。
    我们必须从美帝国主义、日本垄断资本同日本人民的矛盾（这是基本矛盾）这个立场出发，还要去研究农民问题。因此，就有必要采取加强反对两个敌人的统一战线及其基础的工农联盟这个根本方针。富农作为剥削者是同贫农有阶级矛盾，有对立关系的。富农本身在价格斗争等斗争中常常掉队，同时，富农实际上往往起着反动统治集团或者自由民主党积极的走狗的作用。如果不开展以贫农和中农为核心的斗争，农村的斗争就不能真正得到发展，这一点已经成了加强农村工作方面的一个重要的任务。
    假如不重视依靠贫农、同中农结成联盟、维护他们的利益的斗争，就不能使斗争全面地发展。关于富农，一方面要看到有可能同他们进行必要的联合和合作来反对美日统治集团的进攻和掠夺，但是同时又要在他们起反动作用的时候对他们斗争；在争取农村民主化及其他的斗争中，贫农和中农特别是贫农的斗争和组织必须起核心作用。从这个意义看来，必须根据阶级分化的现状，迅速地、飞跃地扩大党和民主力量在农村中的斗争和组织，这就成为方针的出发点。
    其次是文化界人士问题。文化界人士和知识分子空前广泛而积极地参加了这次的斗争，这件事情的意义是很大的。我们党首先要给全体文化界人士的积极性的这种发扬以很高的评价。而且，今后仍然把他们的精力作为反对“安全条约”和保卫民主的统一行动的一翼而加以集中。这是全体人民的利益。即使不一定使各种现有的文化界人士组织立即参加“国民会议”，但是整个来说，必须努力使它们作为联合斗争组织的一部分有机地联合起来。
    整个来说，在这次斗争中，好几千名大学教授和那些对政治问题几乎从来没有发表过意见的人们都发挥了参加集会和游行示威的积极性。把这种积极性作为日本人民宝贵的精力的一个重要部分来加以评价，以这样的评价来给知识分子以越来越大的鼓舞，并且明确指出知识分子只有同以工人阶级为中心的统一战线结合在一起才能够实现自己的要求，努力发展和加强广大人民的统一战线，这就是基本方向。
        “国民会议”的正确发展方向
    现在“国民会议”的发展方向已经成为一个问题。我们党已经发表过这方面的建议，因此就不再赘述了。最近社会党发表了废除“安全条约”的方针；在有关重要的问题上，我们党和社会党是一致的。不过，从社会党的“政治方针解说”等文件中关于对共产党的论述看来，今后我们还需要为实现共产党、社会党和“总评”在对等的立场上进行合作的方针而努力奋斗，这种合作就是加强统一战线的前提，也是早在1月17日就提出的要求。尽管还存在各种困难，但是全国性的和各地的两千个联合斗争组织所反映出来的人民团结的实际情况，说明现在已经有一股广泛的团结的力量，光凭某一方面的方针是不能加以否定的。
    现在有一部分人为了吸收全国产业别工会联合会（“新产别”）和全日本工会会议（“全劳”）参加，提出了“为了发展而解散”“国民会议”的建议。但是，无论以什么名义，如果要采取使这个联合斗争组织变成一个有名无实的空架子或者把它取消的方针，那么，采取这种方针的人将只会脱离日本民主力量团结的方向。日本人民的力量在反对安全条约的斗争中至少已经获得了那样的进展。我们必须具有既坚持原则而又有灵活性的方针顽强地前进。当然，社会党和共产党之间在思想上和政治上是有各种分歧的，但是，实际上在要废除“安全条约”这个重要方向方面是一致的，还有要恢复中日邦交及其他方面的许多共同点。我们认为，如果很好地肯定这种一致的地方，并且根据这种一致的地方在实际上加强合作，以日益加强团结，那么，即使进行必要的互相批评，但是还是有条件去取得人民联合斗争组织的正确发展的。
      整个来说，“总评”在联合斗争的那种情况下发挥了很大的积极作用。而且，实际上，我们党和“总评”，整个来说，是一直在友好的关系中前进的。我们党在“总评”举行大会的时候对议案也提出了意见，特别是从民主力量团结的立场出发阐明支持社会党的问题意味着什么。
      显然，我们并不是从要求只支持我们党这种宗派主义的、只为自己的立场出发来提出这个问题的。事实上，同一直在反对“安全条约”这样重要的问题上进行联合斗争的政党携手、合作，无论从工会的原则还是从日本统一行动的现状看来，都是恰当的。但是，尽管有相当多的反对意见，“总评”大会还是通过了支持社会党的方针。
      关于是什么东西使我们取得了一党一派所不能取得的成就这个问题，我们今后要耐心地说明：必须认真地汲取反对“安全条约”斗争的经验教训；不建立统一战线，就不能取得战胜两个敌人的条件，也无法成立废除“安全条约”的政府。这个任务显得越来越重要。这样，在统一战线和党的前进道路上，一定能够从根本上改善工人运动和政党之间的关系。只有这个方向才能够保证工会的团结，维护统一战线的发展，为工人阶级和人民的利益服务。这并不是仅仅从一党一派的立场出发，把我们党的利益强加于工人运动之类的问题。我们深信这一个方向最后一定为日本工人运动中的多数人所了解并且获得他们的支持。

            争取在竞选斗争中跃进
      选举这个问题，在这次积极分子会议上，是一个我们必须在实践上最重视的中心问题。它不仅仅是反对“安全条约”斗争的继续。民主力量在这次选举中取得什么样的进展，是一个关系到日本的前途的重要问题。这是一次重要的选举，它将成为这样两个前途的分界线：或者是成为军国主义性质的、向复活帝国主义方向发展的野蛮进攻的开端，或者是我们继反对“安全条约”斗争之后推进人民的斗争。在这次选举中，我们仍然要以共同斗争组织——统一行动为基础来进行斗争，这是一个重要的立场。但是，作为斗争方法来说，基本的方向是社、共两党站在一条战线上一道进行斗争。
      池田内阁认为在选举中获胜才是恢复对外信誉的最好的办法，它下了这样顽强的决心，企图依靠诡计多端的策略在选举中一决雌雄。而另一方面，在民主力量中间，甚至还存在着事实上轻视统一战线并且在某种情况下挫伤迄今为止取得的斗争成就的危险倾向。在这个时候，最坚决地主张统一战线即人民团结的共产党在这次选举中能取得何种程度的进展，这不是一个仅仅同党有关的问题，而将给予整个民主力量、日本人民将来的斗争以重大的影响。我们要强调，从上述意义看来，这一次选举比我们经常说的“选举是重要的”那个意思的重要性还重要。
      我们党在1950年的那次镇压和以后的混乱局面中失掉了三十多个议席，从得票数来说，以三百万票为最高峰，从那以后就一直保持着直到最近的状况。但是，现在情况已经不同了。党的队伍扩大了，在这一年里，至少有一万名以上的新同志加入了党，此外，“赤旗报”正刊和它的星期日版合计，在这七个月间增加了二万五千个新的读者。从这个意义上说，党发展了，党的力量扩大了。但是，如果情况只是目前这样，在得票数方面和议席方面要取得飞跃的发展是困难的。在前些日子举行的选举对策本部部长会议上，大家也已经提出了这样的目标：争取获得二百万张到三百万张选票，而议席至少要争取达到五个以上。只是依靠目前这样程度的力量，要在选举中获胜，恐怕是极其困难的。在这一方面，我们绝不能抱有过于乐观的期望。因此，无论如何也要完成六中全会提出的任务——飞跃地扩大党的力量，加强同群众的联系，这作为在选举中获胜的前提条件，已经成了目前最重要的任务。但是，全力投入选举斗争的行动，不仅仅是指扩大党的力量和增加党员人数一倍的行动。它虽然是重要的前提条件，然而我们在这个方面也一定要用两条腿走路。我们要在扩大党的队伍的同时，依据统一战线，扩大同党有联系的各种群众组织（这方面有譬如像大家都知道的群众选举对策组织、后援会以及其他种种形式的组织）；如果不为了蓬勃地发展这条统一战线以及群众组织和积极分子组织而斗争，那么，扩大了的党就不能联系群众，就不能团结群众中的积极部分。
              政党和工会的关系
    政党和工会的关系问题，这也曾经是“总评”大会上的重要问题。我们党一贯认为：对于工会，以社会党要求的那种形式，作为一种组织决定，硬要工会负责所谓支持合作关系并且只支持某一个特定的政党，是不正确的。
    工会保障工会会员在选举中在工会内进行政治活动的自由，保障那种让共产党员和社会党员在工会中都能够充分展开活动的自由，是理所
  当然的事情。采取组织决定的方法硬要会员支持特定的政党，这在实质
  上是妨碍上述政治活动的自由的。在选举中也可以而且有必要采取这样的态度：对共产党提出的关于支持、推荐、合作的建议和呼吁，作为那个工会，不加以歧视，而同对社会党员一样一视同仁，认为共产党也是一个参加了“国民会议”并且同那个工会采取着统一行动的政党，不仅要同社会党保持合作关系，而且也要同共产党保持合作关系，以站在实际上的统一战线的立场上。在这次选举中，党将站在依据共同斗争组织并且发展共同斗争组织的立场上，发出关于建立包括社共两党的统一战线的必要性的呼吁。同时，我们认为共产党才是最正确的，因此要呼吁
  （人民群众）支持共产党。为了加强统一战线，不仅需要呼吁（社共）两党采取统一行动，而且需要使最认真地主张这一点的党获得进展。
    以上是党的呼吁的根本原则。从工会方面来说，要站在“在选举中也同参加共同斗争组织、一道进行斗争的政党展开共同斗争，同时支持这些政党获得进展”这个立场上进行活动，而且保障在选举中进行政治活动的自由。不这样做，便不能全面地理解政党和工会要从各自的立场出发加强统一战线、从各自的立场出发进行选举斗争这个问题。
          加强全体党员的自觉活动
    为了进行选举斗争，今后需要全力进行各种具体的活动。党在全国范围内曾经单独地征集到二百七十五万个签名；而且，我们今后一定要建立起民主联合政府。从这些地方看来，所有的党组织都要不遗余力地进行这次选举斗争，这是很重要的。
    此外，不仅仅要达到得票总数的目标，而且必须千方百计地设法当选。全党在选举中如何地奋起，怎样才能够飞跃地扩大党的力量并且改善党和群众的联系来迎接选举，这是关键所在。为此，党中央召开了在党的历史上未曾有过的这样一次有一千人参加的积极分子大会。我们一定要接连不断地使用积极的办法，把全党投到反对“安全条约”斗争中去的力量同当前群众斗争的发展结合起来，同时在即将到来的选举中展开坚韧不拔的、积极的斗争，使我们党得到进展。
                （四）
            党的发展和党的建设
    最后，谈谈关于党的问题。
    中央委员会认为，党的政治路线、组织、策略上的路线，从六中全会闭幕以后的整个斗争和大会闭幕以后的整个斗争看来，基本上是正确的。党的路线的这种正确性在阻止修改“安全条约”斗争中起了很大的作用。为了加强党，当然首先要加强政治上和思想上的统一。同来自西尾及其他右翼分子的反共分裂主义和来自托洛茨基分子等“左”翼分子的反共和挑衅行动斗争，同对我们党的镇压斗争，并且在斗争中越发锻炼党，发展党的路线，这是扩大党的前提。
    这里有这样一个问题：党还没有最后解决纲领问题。但是，党大会已经以压倒的多数通过了当前的政治组织方针和行动纲领。我们一直遵循这次大会通过的方针和行动纲领，并且遵循把那些方针和行动纲领具体化的中央委员会的方针采取行动并且发展党。形势的变化和斗争的经过证实了大会制订的基本路线和中央委员会采取的基本路线是正确的。这样，在全党范围内，以大会制订的路线和中央委员会采取的路线为核心的团结，在大会结束之后得到了飞跃的增强。中央委员会在大会闭幕以后作出的决定，是经过充分审议之后全场一致通过的。这说明：我们能够按照大会的精神团结起来；虽然存在还没有解决的问题，但是，全党确保了党在当前斗争中团结人民、对敌斗争方面的思想上和政治上的前提条件。
    事实上，党在大会闭幕之后得到了显著的发展和巩固。各地一直在根据六中全会的决议，积极展开增加党员一倍的活动。在目前的形势下，是有扩大党的条件的，而且，如果认真地进行工作的话，是能够做到使党扩大的。我们要好好估计这个情况。可以肯定这样一点：党以工人阶级为泉源，正在大量地吸收着新生的力量。
