Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 22nd: The Cuban people are effectively thwarting the U.S. plot to strangle the Cuban revolution through embargo.

In the early days after the victory of the revolution, Cuba still relied on the United States for 75% of its imports. The value of products Cuba imported from the United States each year reached 400 million U.S. dollars. The United States announced the implementation of an embargo, attempting to paralyze Cuba's economy by exploiting Cuba's dependence on U.S. imports.

In order to oppose U.S. economic aggression, Cuba officially established the Cuban Foreign Trade Bank in May of this year as the sole national import bank to develop trade relations with countries around the world, especially socialist countries.

According to the bank's Vice President, Jacinto Torras, since the bank's establishment, Cuba has obtained products worth more than 60 million U.S. dollars from around the world, thereby ensuring the country's essential supplies and saving a large amount of foreign exchange.

Before the United States announced the embargo in October of this year, Cuba's imports from the United States had already decreased from 75% of total imports to 13%, while imports from socialist countries had risen to over 60%. In addition, Cuba has also established trade relations with countries such as Canada, the United Arab Republic, Morocco, India, and Japan.

After changing its dependence on the U.S. market, Cuba no longer needs to use foreign exchange for almost two-thirds of its imports. Trade between the United States and Cuba has always been unequal. The United States monopolized the Cuban market, raising prices at will. As everyone knows, Cuba's losses in import and export trade with the United States in the ten years before the revolution alone amounted to ten billion U.S. dollars.

Cuban Foreign Trade Bank Vice President Torras recently announced that Cuba used to buy oil from the United States at a price of three U.S. dollars per barrel (one U.S. dollar is equivalent to one peso), but now Cuba only gets oil from the Soviet Union at a cost of two pesos and ten centavos per barrel, including the cost of bringing it to shore. This alone saves Cuba more than 20 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange. Because Cuba buys rice from China and other countries instead of the United States, Cuba has saved another 30 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange.

Cuba is close to the United States, but because U.S. companies control Cuba's import and export shipping, the United States raises transportation prices as it pleases. The shipping price between New York and Cuba is 30 U.S. dollars per ton, but the shipping price from China to Cuba, despite the long distance, is only half of the above price.

Another more important feature of Cuba's trade with the United States is that in order to hinder the development of Cuba's national economy, the United States does not export means of production to Cuba, but only exports consumer goods, and even exports chewing gum and yellow books. The United States rarely exports tractors and trucks to Cuba, but exports a large number of small cars to Cuba, with an annual export value of 30 million U.S. dollars. In addition, exports of luxury goods such as televisions, radios, and washing machines amount to 15 million U.S. dollars each year. Canned food amounts to 17 million U.S. dollars each year, vegetables and fruits amount to 17 million U.S. dollars each year, and meat amounts to more than 30 million U.S. dollars each year. At the same time, U.S. companies in Cuba purchase goods from the United States at high prices in order to send profits and foreign exchange to the United States without paying taxes. An investigation conducted by the Cuban Ministry of Transportation at the Cuban Electric Company pointed out that in the past ten years, this company spent 90 million U.S. dollars in the name of purchasing factories and equipment, and that is how it withdrew foreign exchange from Cuba.

Now, Cuba has signed trade and payment agreements with most socialist countries. This kind of trade is an equal economic cooperation relationship, and its foundation is the desire to promote economic development and common prosperity. Socialist countries are constantly shipping products that Cuba urgently needs to Cuba, such as tractors, oil, rice, cooking oil, etc. The Cuban public unanimously praises the fair prices and excellent quality of products imported from socialist countries. While developing trade, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and other socialist countries have also put forward plans to aid Cuba, that is, to help Cuba establish its own iron and steel metallurgical plants, oil refineries, machine manufacturing plants, and operate mines through long-term loans.

The U.S. embargo has only brought temporary difficulties to Cuba. The heroic Cuban people are confidently relying on their own efforts and the assistance of socialist countries to overcome these temporary difficulties. Rafael Oliva, a worker at the Sherwin-Williams paint factory that has been nationalized, put it well, "These difficulties are temporary, and we are confident that we will overcome them. In the past, we always looked forward to getting off work, but now, even sick workers are trying every means to come to the factory to produce the products needed by the country." Contrary to Wall Street's hopes, the U.S. embargo will only help Cuba break free from U.S. economic shackles and promote the development of Cuba's national economy.

### 摆脱美国经济束缚　增加同社会主义国家的贸易  古巴经济胜利地走上独立发展道路  从世界各地获得了六千多万美元的必需供应品

    摆脱美国经济束缚　增加同社会主义国家的贸易
    古巴经济胜利地走上独立发展道路
    从世界各地获得了六千多万美元的必需供应品
    据新华社哈瓦那22日电　古巴人民正卓有成效地击溃美国企图通过禁运扼杀古巴革命的阴谋。
    在革命胜利后的初期，古巴75％的进口仍是依靠美国的。古巴每年从美国进口的产品价值达四亿美元。美国宣布实行禁运，就是企图利用古巴依赖美国进口这一点来使古巴的经济陷于瘫痪。
    为了反对美国的经济侵略，古巴在今年5月里正式成立了古巴对外贸易银行，作为国家唯一的进口银行，发展同世界各国特别是社会主义国家的贸易关系。
    据这个银行的副行长哈辛托·托拉斯说，自从银行建立以来，古巴已经从世界各地获得了价值六千多万美元的产品，从而保证了国家必需的供应，并且节约了大量的外汇。
    在今年10月间美国宣布禁运之前，古巴从美国的进口额已经从占全部进口额的75％下降到13％，而从社会主义国家的进口额已经上升到60％以上。此外，古巴同加拿大、阿拉伯联合共和国、摩洛哥、印度、日本等国家也建立了贸易关系。
    古巴在改变对美国市场的依赖之后，几乎有三分之二的进口品不再需要动用外汇。美国和古巴之间的贸易一直是不平等的。美国垄断着古巴的市场，为所欲为地抬高价格。大家知道，仅仅在革命胜利前的十年里古巴在同美国的进出口方面的损失就达十亿美元。
    古巴对外贸易银行副行长托拉斯最近宣布说，古巴过去以每桶三美元（一美元相当一比索）的价格向美国购买石油，而目前古巴只以靠岸价格每桶二比索零十分的价格从苏联得到石油。仅此一项，古巴就节约了二千多万美元的外汇。由于古巴不向美国而向中国和其它国家购买大米，古巴又节约了三千多万美元的外汇。
    古巴靠近美国，但是，由于美国公司控制着古巴进出口的海运工具，美国随心所欲地提高运输价格。纽约和古巴之间的海运价格为每吨三十美元，可是从中国到古巴的海运价格，尽管路程遥远，却只相当于上述价格的一半。
    古巴同美国贸易的另一更重要的特征是：为了阻挠古巴国民经济的发展，美国不向古巴出口生产资料，而只是出口生活资料，甚至出口口香糖和黄色书籍。美国很少向古巴出口拖拉机和卡车，但是却向古巴输出大批小轿车，每年的出口值达三千万美元。此外如电视机、收音机、洗衣机等奢侈品的出口每年达一千五百万美元。罐头食品每年达一千七百万美元，蔬菜和水果每年达一千七百万美元，肉类每年达三千多万美元。同时，在古巴的美国公司用高价从美国购进商品，以便把利润和外汇送往美国而不纳税。古巴交通部在古巴电力公司里所作的调查指出，在最近十年里，这家公司以置办工厂和设备为名支出了九千万美元，它就是这样把外汇从古巴抽走的。
    现在，古巴同大多数社会主义国家签订了贸易和支付协定。这种贸易是平等的经济合作关系，它的基础是互相促进经济发展和共同繁荣的愿望。社会主义国家正在不断地向古巴运来古巴迫切需要的产品，如拖拉机、石油、大米、食油等等。古巴公众一致称赞从社会主义国家进口的产品价格公平，品质优良。在发展贸易的同时，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、波兰和其它社会主义国家还提出了援助古巴的计划，即通过长期贷款来帮助古巴建立古巴自己的钢铁冶金工厂、炼油厂、机器制造厂和经营矿山等。
    美国的禁运只是给古巴带来了暂时的困难，英勇的古巴人民正满怀信心地依靠自己的努力和社会主义国家的援助，克服着这些暂时的困难。被收归国有的谢尔温·威廉斯绘画颜料工厂的工人拉斐尔·奥利瓦说得好，“这些困难是暂时的，我们确信我们一定会克服这些困难。过去，我们总是盼着下工，可是现在，甚至连有病的工人都想一切办法到工厂来为国家生产所需要的产品。”与华尔街的希望相反，美国的禁运只会有利于古巴摆脱美国的经济束缚和促进古巴国民经济的发展。
