Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 15th: Hunan is seizing the sunny days after rain to rush harvest the double-cropping late rice. As of the 11th, more than half of the province's double-cropping late rice has been harvested; Xiangtan Prefecture, which is progressing faster, has harvested 90%.

    Leading cadres at all levels have gone deep into the front lines of production to strengthen specific leadership of the rush harvest work, conscientiously implement policies, and carry out high-efficiency and high-quality appraisal and competition. Xiangyin County also organized labor cooperation between teams that have finished harvesting late rice and teams that are progressing slowly, according to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange. The supporting teams implement a "five-fixed" method of fixed leadership, fixed labor, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed remuneration. Labor remuneration is paid by the supported unit according to the amount of harvest and the agreed standards. After these measures were taken, the rush harvest progress was greatly accelerated. As of the 11th, the county had harvested 98% of its double-cropping late rice.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: The double-cropping late rice in Anhui has been universally harvested. In order to harvest this year's last season of grain crops meticulously and cleanly, measures have been taken to harvest one piece as it yellows, and to harvest the earliest yellowing first, which has accelerated the harvest progress and improved the quality. As of the 8th, more than 70% of the province's double-cropping late rice had been harvested.

    In order to achieve timely harvesting and ensure that every grain returns home, counties in the Wuhu Prefecture have conscientiously implemented work point assessment and quota management. Party committee secretaries at all levels in Zongyang County of Anqing Prefecture personally took the lead, participating in harvesting and threshing. In distant fields, they built fields on the spot, harvesting and threshing as they went; in fields along highways, they not only harvested and threshed as they went, but also sold and delivered as they went, so as to avoid repeated transportation and cause spillage and loss. So far, more than 90% of the county's late rice has been harvested, and after inspection and acceptance, it has all been harvested meticulously.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning: The double-cropping late rice and autumn miscellaneous grain crops in Guangxi have matured one after another, and a large-scale autumn harvest has begun.

    This year, most of Guangxi's winter crops can only be sown after the autumn harvest frees up the land. Production teams in all people's communes have taken strong measures to concentrate labor for rush harvesting. Many places have also actively promoted the use of harvesters. According to statistics from eleven counties including Longjin, Hengxian, and Yongning, there are currently more than 10,000 rapid harvesters in use. After the harvesters are put into the autumn harvest, the work efficiency is generally increased by one to two times compared to using sickles.

    After the Tianxin Brigade of Munan Commune in Ningming County mobilized commune members to discuss the overproduction reward policy, the commune members realized that the more meticulous the harvesting and threshing, the more overproduction there would be. Therefore, everyone consciously harvested meticulously. The entire brigade achieved harvesting at nine maturity, harvesting and threshing on the same day, re-harvesting in the fields and re-threshing on the threshing ground, threshing cleanly, drying thoroughly, harvesting cleanly and storing well.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 15th: The late rice harvest and winter planting work in Guangdong have been fully launched. As of November 9, the province had harvested more than 10 million mu of late rice and sown more than 13 million mu of winter crops.

    Guangdong has a large area of ​​late rice this year, and the maturity is consistent; the planned winter planting area is also much larger than last year. In order to complete the harvesting and planting work in a timely manner, all localities have mobilized labor, animal power, and tools to form two teams, one for autumn harvesting and one for winter planting, harvesting one piece as it ripens, cutting one piece, plowing one piece, and planting one piece, so as to promote planting with harvesting and promote harvesting with planting. At the same time, labor management is strengthened conscientiously, group operations are implemented, and labor competitions are carried out. Production teams in all people's communes in Wanning County have fully implemented the group operation responsibility system in the autumn harvest and winter planting, implemented work point assessment, paid according to work, and labor efficiency has been significantly improved.

    In order to ensure meticulous harvesting and threshing and that every grain returns to the granary, production teams in people's communes have generally formulated meticulous harvesting and threshing measures based on harvesting, threshing, drying, and transportation. After Shixing County took these measures, the county harvested more than 91,000 jin of grain in seven days. Heyuan County also immediately organized re-harvesting and re-threshing after the autumn harvest was basically completed, and harvested more than 170,000 jin of rice.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, November 15th: As of November 9, the second-season late rice in Jiangxi Province has been basically harvested; the picking of cotton and rapeseed has entered the final stage; the harvest of late sweet potatoes, late soybeans, peanuts and other crops and wild plants is in full swing.

    In order to ensure that the fruits of the autumn harvest return to the granary, completely and cleanly, people's communes in various places have launched a re-harvesting and re-threshing campaign. People's communes in rural Nanchang City have recently recovered more than 1.2 million jin of rice through re-harvesting and re-threshing. People's communes in cotton-growing areas of Ji'an County have also recovered more than 32,000 jin of seed cotton through re-picking and re-sorting.
