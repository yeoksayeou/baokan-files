    This newspaper report: Gengzhuang Production Brigade in Chengguan Commune, Qihe County, Shandong Province, adopted a "three-way combination" method to make thorough and meticulous arrangements for the lives of commune members, and achieved "three matches" and "three implementations." This further enhanced the confidence of commune members in overcoming the disaster and promoted the comprehensive development of the production and disaster relief movement.

    Gengzhuang Brigade suffered a relatively severe disaster this year, which brought difficulties to arranging the lives of commune members. In order to completely overcome the disaster this winter and next spring, the brigade adopted a three-way combination method to make thorough and meticulous arrangements for the lives of commune members. The "three-way combination" means combining the sharing of family assets with mobilizing the masses; combining taking stock team by team, household by household with solving specific difficulties; and combining arranging rations once until next summer harvest with implementing them in stages. In implementing the three-way combination for arranging the lives of commune members, the brigade first disclosed three sets of figures to the teams and commune members: ① Grain reserves. Clarify to commune members the total grain harvested by the entire brigade. After deducting seeds and feed, calculate based on the grain standard for disaster areas. There is still a shortage of more than 30,000 jin of grain from November this year to the end of June next year; ② Vegetable reserves. The entire brigade, in addition to the dried vegetables already accumulated and the existing autumn vegetables that can be eaten for 173 days, is still short of vegetables for about 70 days; ③ Firewood reserves. After deducting the grass for livestock, the entire brigade is still short of more than 250,000 jin of firewood. While disclosing the figures, Party members and activists from poor peasant backgrounds were the backbone in leading the masses to offer suggestions and ideas. During the discussion, everyone put forward more than 50 methods around solving the problems of rations, vegetables, and firewood, and achieved simultaneous suggestion, research, and action. Commune members of the Third Team, in solving the problem of insufficient rations, proposed more than a dozen methods such as re-harvesting and re-threshing, and planting more early-maturing crops. The next day, commune member Ji Yunzhen led six commune members to threshing ground, and after threshing 85 mu of bean stalks, they harvested more than 120 jin of soybeans. Commune members of the First Team, when discussing how to solve the problem of insufficient firewood, in addition to proposing a combination of collective and individual collection, also suggested organizing labor to dredge aquatic plants in the Northeast Dawa area for feed, and allocate corn stalks to commune members as firewood. Commune member Geng Naizhi led more than 20 commune members to pick grass on the Yellow River levee, and picked more than 6,000 jin in one day.

    On the basis of disclosing the figures and mobilizing the masses, the brigade also organized cadres to combine taking stock team by team, household by household with solving specific difficulties. The entire brigade has a total of three production teams. After thorough investigation and taking stock, it was found that there were imbalances between the teams in terms of rations, vegetables, and firewood. For example, in terms of vegetables, the second team planted a total of 55 mu of carrots in the fields and vegetables in the canteen, with an average of more than 500 jin per person, while the first team had an average of less than 200 jin per person. In terms of grain varieties, some teams had more beans, while others had fewer beans. The brigade helped the teams to specifically study solutions to these problems. When arranging the lives of commune members household by household at the team level, some practical problems in the lives of some commune members were also discovered and solved in a timely manner. For example, the Second Team has a total of 40 households. Through household visits and taking stock, it was found that more than a dozen households with illness who could not participate in labor and with many people and little labor force, were experiencing difficulties in life. The brigade adopted the method of allocating funds for relief and the team's assistance to solve the difficulties of each household. After thorough and meticulous household arrangements throughout the brigade, every commune member felt satisfied.

    In terms of ration arrangements, the brigade, based on the spirit of eating more during busy farming seasons and less during slack seasons, careful calculations, and leaving room for flexibility, adopted a combination of arranging once until next summer harvest and implementing the living plan in stages.

    In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the commune members' livelihood arrangement plan, the brigade, while adopting the "three-way combination" method, also implemented "three matches" and "three implementations" for rations, vegetables, and firewood. In terms of rations, warehouse grain reserves are matched with commune members' quotas. All warehouse grain reserves have been weighed and recorded, and converted according to the number of people and their quotas, and ration savings books have been issued to commune members. In terms of vegetables, in addition to adopting the method of "vegetables follow grain," that is, weighing, distributing, recording, and matching numbers of people with existing dried and fresh vegetables, package production plans and contracts have also been drawn up for the management of winter vegetables that have been planted and spring vegetables that are planned to be planted next spring, and are assigned to special personnel. In terms of firewood, a general survey was conducted by team. Collective firewood and commune members' self-used firewood were separately calculated, and after the required figures were implemented, on the one hand, the existing firewood and grass were distributed and cashed in, and on the other hand, commune members were mobilized and organized to pick grass.

    Because the brigade has thoroughly and meticulously arranged the lives of commune members, it has further improved people's confidence and determination to produce and provide disaster relief. As of November 19, more than 4,200 jin of sweet potatoes have been re-harvested, more than 1,200 jin of soybeans have been re-threshed, more than 180,000 jin of firewood have been collected, and more than 5,000 jin of non-staple food have been collected. At the same time, winter agricultural and sideline production has also been very successful. (Attached photo)

    逐队逐户排队摸底　发动群众解决问题
    耿庄大队生产救灾工作扎扎实实
    深入细致安排社员生活，增加了群众抗灾斗争的力量
    本报讯　山东齐河县城关公社耿庄生产大队，采用“三结合”的方法，深入细致地安排社员生活，并做到“三对口”、“三落实”，进一步提高了社员战胜灾荒的信心，推动了生产救灾运动的全面开展。
    耿庄大队今年遭受了比较严重的灾害，给安排社员生活带来了困难。为了彻底战胜今冬明春的灾荒，这个大队采用三结合的办法，对社员的生活进行了深入细致的安排。“三结合”，即交家底和发动群众相结合，逐队逐户排队和解决具体困难相结合，口粮一次安排到明年夏收和分段执行相结合。在实行三结合安排社员生活中，大队首先向小队、社员交了三个底：①粮食底。向社员讲清全大队实收粮食，扣除种子、饲料，按灾区口粮标准计算，从今年11月到明年6月底，尚缺口粮三万多斤；②蔬菜底。全大队除已积的干菜和现有的秋菜可吃一百七十三天以外，尚缺七十天左右的蔬菜；③烧柴底。全大队现有的草扣除牲口草以后，尚缺烧柴二十五万多斤。在交底的同时，以党团员和贫农积极分子为骨干，带领群众献策献计。在讨论中，大家围绕解决口粮、蔬菜、烧柴等问题，提出了五十多种办法，并做到了边提议、边研究、边行动。第三小队的社员们，在解决口粮不足的问题上，提出了复收复打、多种早熟作物等十几条办法。第二天，社员纪云贞就领着六个社员去打场，八十五亩豆秸普打了一遍，又收了大豆一百二十多斤。第一小队的社员们，在讨论解决烧柴不足的问题时，除提出集体拾与分散拾相结合的办法以外，还建议组织劳力到东北大洼里捞水草作饲料，顶出玉米秸分给社员作烧柴。社员耿乃志领着二十多个社员到黄河大坝拾草，一天就拾了六千多斤。
    在交底和发动群众的基础上，大队又组织干部，逐队逐户进行排队和解决具体困难相结合。全大队共有三个生产小队，经过深入摸底排队，发现小队与小队之间，在口粮、蔬菜、烧柴等方面都有不平衡的现象。如在菜的方面，第二小队大田种的胡萝卜和食堂种的菜共五十五亩，每人平均占有五百多斤，而第一小队每人却平均不到二百斤。在粮食品种上，有的队豆子多，有的队豆子少。对这些问题都帮助小队具体研究了解决的办法。在以小队为单位逐户安排社员生活时，也发现了一些社员生活上的实际问题，并及时进行了解决。如第二小队共四十户社员，通过逐户访问排队的结果，对其中有病不能参加劳动和人口多、劳力少，造成生活困难的十几户社员，采取大队拨款救济和小队帮助的办法，各户困难得到解决。全大队经过深入细致的逐户安排之后，每户社员都感到满意。
    在口粮安排上，这个大队又根据农忙多吃，农闲少吃，精打细算，留有余地的精神，采取了一次安排到明年夏收和分段执行生活计划相结合的办法。
    为了使社员的生活安排计划得以顺利实现，这个大队在采取“三结合”办法的同时，又进行了口粮、蔬菜、烧柴“三对口”和“三落实”。在口粮方面，仓库存粮与社员定量对口落实。仓库存粮已全部过秤记账，并根据以人定量的数字，进行了折算，发给社员口粮存折。在蔬菜方面，除对已有的干菜和鲜菜，采取了菜随粮走的办法，做到边收边过秤边分配边记账和人数对口落实以外，同时对已种的越冬菜的管理工作和明年春天计划种植的春菜等，也订出了包产计划，签定了合同，由专人负责。在烧柴方面，以小队为单位进行了普查，对集体用柴和社员自用柴，分别作了核算，做到需用数字落实后，一方面把现有柴草分配兑现，一方面发动和组织社员拾草。
    这个大队由于深入细致地安排了社员生活，更加提高了人们生产救灾的信心与决心。到11月19日，已复收地瓜四千二百多斤，复打大豆一千二百多斤，拾烧柴十八万多斤，收集副食品五千多斤。同时，冬季农副业生产也搞得很有起色。（附图片）
