Xinhua News Agency, November 27th, London dispatch: A Reuters report from London on November 26th, analyzing the outflow of gold from the United States, stated that it can be assumed that the United States' gold reserves have actually fallen below $17.5 billion, as $500 million of the United States' reserves are gold borrowed from the International Monetary Fund.

The report said that the recent loss of American gold has reduced the United States' gold reserves to below $18 billion, the lowest point in more than twenty years. In recent weeks, several major thresholds have been broken.

The report pointed out that in the week ending November 23rd, the United States lost another $20 million in gold. A loss of $20 million in a week is still a significant figure, and much larger figures recently have been staggering. Week after week, in order to suppress the price of gold in London, the US Treasury Department may have to spend more than $20 million in gold each week – some weeks less than that, but others may be more. At such a cost, the price in London has not returned to parity with the dollar, which may be impossible.

Reuters pointed out that, more seriously in the long run, the United States has begun to lose dollar reserves again. In the three weeks up to November 9th, Americans and foreigners exchanged $600 million for other currencies of foreign central banks. In the most recent week (up to Wednesday), it is estimated that $50 million was exchanged for other currencies. Foreign central banks increased their dollar investments and dollar deposits by $30 million.

The report said that because foreign short-term dollar claims can theoretically be converted into gold, and because the number of these claims now exceeds the United States' gold reserves, the US authorities certainly view the outflow of dollars as almost as serious as the outflow of gold.

The United States has significant drawing rights with the International Monetary Fund. But drawing from this organization would be seen as a sign of weakness.

### 黄金大量外流　美元地位虚弱  路透社说美国难以稳定黄金市场价格

    黄金大量外流　美元地位虚弱
    路透社说美国难以稳定黄金市场价格
    新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：路透社26日从伦敦发出的一条分析美国黄金外流情况的报道说，可以认为美国黄金储备实际上已经降到一百七十五亿美元以下，因为美国储备中还有五亿美元是从国际货币组织借来的黄金。
    报道说，最近美国黄金的流失使美国的黄金储备减少到了一百八十亿美元以下，这是二十多年的最低点。在最近几星期中已经破了几个在性质上重要的大关。
    报道指出，在截至23日为止的一周中，美国的黄金又流失了二千万美元。在一周内流失二千万美元，这个数字仍然是很大的，最近比这大得多的数字是惊人的。一周复一周地，为了压低伦敦的金价，美国财政部每周可能要花二千多万美元的黄金——有几星期比这个数目少些，但是另外几星期可能比这个数目多些。花了这样的代价，并没有使伦敦的价格回到同美元平价的水平，这可能是做不到的。
    路透社指出，在潜在方面更为严重的是，美国已经重新开始流失美元储备，在到11月9日为止的三星期中，美国人和外国人把六亿美元换成外国中央银行的其他货币。在最近一星期（到星期三为止），换成其他货币的美元估计有五千万美元。外国中央银行使它们的美元投资和美元存款增加了三千万美元。
    报道说，因为外国的短期美元债权在理论上都可以换成黄金，而且因为这种债权数目现在已经超过了美国的黄金储备，所以美国当局当然把美元的外流看得同黄金的外流几乎一样严重。
    美国对国际货币基金组织有很大的提款权利。但是美国从这个组织提款将被认为是虚弱的表示。
