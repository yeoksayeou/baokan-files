    This newspaper reports that the people of all ethnic groups in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, holding high the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have achieved great success in developing agriculture and grain production at the source of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, at an altitude of about 4,000 meters. This year, the total sown area of various crops in the entire autonomous prefecture has increased more than fourfold compared to last year, and more than twentyfold compared to before liberation. Due to the bumper grain harvest, grain self-sufficiency has been achieved for the first time in history, ending the long-term dependence on grain supplies from other areas.

    Currently, the vast Tibetan farmers and herdsmen on the grasslands are all smiles, joyfully harvesting the crops from the first year of large-scale agricultural development. The people of all ethnic groups in Angqian County have planted more than 220,000 mu of crops this year, which are generally growing well. In Qumalai County, located at the source of the Yellow River and where crops have never been grown before, Tibetan commune members have also grown Chinese cabbage, radishes, and potatoes on the plateau at an altitude of more than 4,800 meters. In order to ensure that the grain is safely harvested, all communes have concentrated more than 80% of their labor force to rush the harvest, and have launched a campaign for full attendance, high quality, and high work efficiency. Work efficiency has generally reached one mu or more harvested per person per day. Currently, the crops in the entire autonomous prefecture have been basically harvested.

    Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has fertile land and abundant water resources, making it a good place for animal husbandry and agriculture. However, before liberation, with the exception of a small amount of agriculture in Yushu, Chengduo, and Angqian counties, the entire prefecture was almost a single animal husbandry economy. The vast herdsmen could not get enough to eat and wear, and sometimes had to live a primitive life of eating cyperus roots and grass seeds. After liberation, agricultural production gradually developed. In particular, after the decisive victory of the socialist revolution in pastoral areas in 1958, and the establishment of people's communes, the development of agricultural production entered a new stage. In 1959, agricultural production developed by leaps and bounds compared to 1957: the sown area increased by more than onefold compared to 1957. Angqian, Yushu, and Chengduo counties basically achieved grain self-sufficiency.

    Under the guidance of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, the Yushu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," launched a upsurge of large-scale agricultural development and grain production in the autonomous prefecture in 1960, and launched a land reclamation and farmland creation movement to march towards wasteland and ask the land for grain. The vast number of state-owned farm workers, commune members, and office cadres, three major forces fought on the agricultural front, reclaiming more than one million mu of wasteland last winter and this spring. After the spring equinox and the thawing of the land, people of all ethnic groups launched a spring production upsurge to prevent drought, fight drought, and rush spring planting, vigorously building water conservancy projects and expanding the irrigated area by more than 300,000 mu. More than ten communes, including Zhaduo and Zhidu counties, as well as the Hongxing Commune in Yushu County, have also realized river network development. In order to win a bumper harvest in 1960, the Yushu Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China strengthened its leadership over agriculture. Party committees at all levels were headed by the first secretary to grasp agriculture. Cadres at all levels from the prefecture to the production team went deep into the fields, adopting methods such as working in the team, organizing work groups to conduct inspections, and a large number of county and commune leading cadres held concurrent posts at the grassroots level, effectively strengthening the leadership over agricultural production. Shen Ling, the first secretary of the prefectural party committee, and other party and government responsible comrades often went deep into the front line, eating, living, laboring, and discussing with commune members, which greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of the masses.

    In the process of developing agriculture on a large scale, the people of all ethnic groups in the Yushu area encountered difficulties such as a shortage of labor, a lack of tools, and poor technology. Many herdsmen were reclaiming land and planting crops for the first time. However, thanks to the full play of the superiority of the people's commune and the proper arrangement of labor, they finally overcame many difficulties. Many communes in Qumalai, Zhidu, Zhaduo and other counties, where crops were grown for the first time, with the help of Han cadres and commune members with agricultural production experience, quickly became a new force in agricultural production while learning and doing. Under the slogan of asking tools for labor and asking technology for time, leading cadres and the masses at all levels jointly studied and reformed primitive and backward farm tools such as two-ox plows, and promoted new farm tools such as mountain walking plows, horse-drawn harvesters, and threshers. More than 50 factories serving agricultural and pastoral production, which grew with the large-scale development of agriculture, played a full role in the promotion and innovation of agricultural tools. Since the beginning of this year, more than 20,000 pieces of agricultural tools have been promoted and innovated throughout the prefecture, and production efficiency has increased several times to dozens of times. In overcoming the difficulties of land reclamation and planting, the Party and the People's Government also transported a large number of new agricultural tools and several million kilograms of seeds from thousands of miles away to supply the needs of planting in various people's communes. The local People's Liberation Army has repeatedly helped people of all ethnic groups to reclaim land, plant, and harvest. In order to achieve diversified, high-yield and high-yield, people's communes throughout the prefecture vigorously improved farming techniques, engaged in intensive cultivation, established more than 300,000 mu of high-yield fields, and comprehensively promoted a series of management measures such as rational close planting, diligent weeding, timely and appropriate watering, and topdressing.

    In response to the changeable climate in the plateau area and the frequent harm of frost and hail, the vast number of commune members, with the heroic spirit of man conquering nature, adopted methods such as digging frost-proof holes in the fields, using smoke and fire to fumigate, setting up old farmers' weather observation holes, and organizing county and commune joint prevention, and fighting against natural disasters. This year, state-owned farms, people's communes, and office cadres in the Zhaji area of ​​Angqian County worked together to overcome frost three times, resulting in a large-scale bumper harvest of more than 80,000 mu of highland barley and wheat.

    江河源头大办农业　青藏高原喜收秋粮
    玉树藏族自治州贯彻农牧结合方针粮食完全自给
    本报讯　青海省玉树藏族自治州的各族人民，高举总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，在拔海四千米左右的长江、黄河源头大办农业、大办粮食取得了很大成绩。今年，全自治州各类作物播种面积较去年猛增四倍多，比解放前增长二十多倍。由于粮食获得丰产，有史以来第一次实现了粮食自给，结束了长期依靠外地供应粮食的局面。
    目前，草原上广大藏族农牧民笑逐颜开，喜收大办农业第一年的庄稼。昂欠县各族群众今年种植的二十二万多亩庄稼普遍生长良好。位于黄河发源地、从未种过庄稼的曲麻莱县，藏族社员还在海拔四千八百多米的高原上种出了大白菜、萝卜、洋芋。为了确保粮食颗粒归仓，各公社都集中了80％以上的劳力突击抢收，并开展了满勤、优质、高工效运动，工效普遍达到一人一天收割一亩以上。目前，全自治州的庄稼已基本收割完毕。
    玉树藏族自治州土地肥沃、水源丰富，是宜牧、宜农的好地方。但是解放前除了玉树、称多、昂欠三县经营少量农业外，全州几乎是单一的牧业经济，广大牧民不得温饱，有时不得不过着吃莞根、草籽的原始生活。解放后，农业生产逐年得到发展，特别是1958年牧区社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利，成立了人民公社，农业生产的发展进入了一个新的阶段。1959年农业生产比1957年有了飞跃发展：播种面积比1957年增加一倍多。昂欠、玉树、称多三个县基本上达到粮食自给。
    在以农业为国民经济基础的方针指导下，中共玉树州委根据“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针，1960年在自治州掀起了大办农业、大办粮食的热潮，展开了向荒地进军、向大地要粮的垦荒造田运动，县县社社开荒种地。广大国营农场职工、公社社员和机关干部，三支大军奋战农业战线，去冬今春一举开荒百万多亩。春分土地解冻后，各族人民又掀起了防旱抗旱和突击春播的春季生产热潮，大兴水利，扩大灌溉面积三十多万亩，杂多、治多两县以及玉树县红星公社等十多个公社，并实现了河网化。为了夺取1960年的丰收，中共玉树州委加强了对农业的领导，各级党委都由第一书记挂帅抓农业，从州到生产队各级干部深入田间，采取住队办公、组织工作组巡回检查等办法，大批县、社领导干部到基层兼职，有效地加强了对农业生产的领导。州委第一书记沈岭和其他党政负责同志经常深入第一线，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，极大地鼓舞了广大群众的劳动热情。
    玉树地区各族人民在大办农业中，遇到了劳动力少、工具缺、技术差的困难，许多牧民都是第一次开荒种地。但是由于人民公社充分发挥了优越性，妥善地安排了劳力，终于战胜了重重困难。第一次种庄稼的曲麻莱、治多、杂多等县许多公社的牧民，在汉族干部和有农业生产经验的社员的帮助下，边学边干，迅速成为一支新的农业生力军。在向工具要劳力，向技术要时间的口号下，各级领导干部和群众共同研究，改革二牛抬杠等原始落后农具，推广山地步犁、马拉收割机、脱粒机等新式农具。随着大办农业而成长的为农牧业生产服务的五十多个工厂，在推广和革新农具中充分发挥了作用。今年以来，全州推广和革新农具二万多件，生产效率成倍成十倍地提高。在克服开荒种地的困难中，党和人民政府还远从千里之外运来大批新式农具和几百万斤种子，供应各人民公社播种需要。当地人民解放军多次帮助各族人民开荒、播种和收割。为了实现多种高产多收，全州各人民公社大力改进耕作技术，大搞精耕细作，建立起三十多万亩丰产方，全面推广了合理密植、勤锄草、适时、适量浇水、追肥等一系列管理措施。
    针对高原地区气候多变，经常有霜冻、冰雹危害的情况，广大社员以人定胜天的豪迈气概，采取地头挖防霜洞，用烟火熏，设立老农天气观测洞，组织县、社联防等办法，向自然灾害作斗争。今年，昂欠县扎吉地区的国营农场、人民公社和机关干部齐心协力，三次战胜霜冻，使八万多亩青稞、小麦获得了大面积丰收。
