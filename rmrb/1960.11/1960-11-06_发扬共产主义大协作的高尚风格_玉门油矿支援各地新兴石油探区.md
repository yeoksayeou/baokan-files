    Promote the Noble Style of Communist Collaboration
    Yumen Oil Mine Supports Emerging Oil Exploration Areas Across the Country

    (Our report) Guided by the thought of “the whole nation as a single chessboard,” all the workers and staff of Yumen Oil Mine are actively promoting the noble style of communist collaboration, selflessly and comprehensively supporting emerging oil exploration areas across the country.

    Over the past two years, Yumen Oil Mine has sent over 13,000 outstanding workers and staff to new exploration areas and brother oil factories and mines across the country, and has supported them with complete sets of drilling, refining and other machinery and equipment and materials totaling over 18,000 tons. This year, under the overall arrangement of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, Yumen Oil Mine organized a larger-scale support campaign, mobilizing 50% of its construction force and 51% of its construction and installation and mechanical power equipment and complete sets of construction tools to support fraternal units in seven provinces and municipalities, helping fraternal units to overcome difficulties in capital construction and production. Because all the workers and staff of Yumen Oil Mine regard support as their most glorious task, they send their best workers and staff to support the new exploration areas. In the past two years, among the more than 13,000 workers and staff sent to support various regions, leading cadres and engineering technicians at the section level and above accounted for more than 1,000. The supporting personnel also included various types of work such as exploration, oil extraction, refining, oilfield construction, machinery, hydropower, and transportation, achieving organizational matching and personnel matching, providing important material conditions for the comprehensive development of construction and production in the new exploration areas. They also supported fraternal units with the best drilling teams and the most outstanding workers and staff. For example, the Wang Jinxi Drilling Team, the Xue Guobang Oil Production Team, and the Sheng Aibang Workover Team, which were sent to support fraternal units, are all advanced collectives that the bureau has focused on cultivating in recent years. In the development of the Laojunmiao Oilfield, they have excellently completed the state plan every year and have become famous pacesetters on the petroleum industrial front.

    In terms of equipment and materials, Yumen Oil Mine also took out the best and newest, and even the most urgently needed for its own use, to support other places. Last year, the output of the Karamay Oilfield increased sharply, and rapidly expanding the crude oil processing capacity was a key problem that needed to be solved at that time. Yumen Oil Mine immediately transferred the complete set of vacuum distillation equipment from a refinery that it had built but not yet put into production to them, which played a great role in expanding the quality of products in the new Karamay Oilfield. Since the beginning of this year, Yumen Oil Mine has been continuously transporting large quantities of complete sets of drilling, oil extraction, workover, electrical equipment, and various mechanical power, tools and materials to support new oil exploration areas. Before these equipment and materials were shipped, they underwent detailed inspection and test run. When providing support, considering the weak repair capacity of the new exploration areas, more than 40 electric welding machines were sent to support the new exploration areas after being carefully selected from the good equipment in the spirit of self-denial and letting others benefit. In addition, they also enthusiastically and unreservedly passed on their latest technical experience to fraternal units, provided various technical materials, and made every effort to help the new exploration areas solve technical difficulties through on-site meetings, training technical workers on their behalf, and organizing experience promotion teams. In the past two years alone, they have disseminated more than 550 important technical experiences to fraternal factories and mines and provided more than 40,000 technical materials.

    发扬共产主义大协作的高尚风格
    玉门油矿支援各地新兴石油探区
    本报讯　玉门油矿全体职工，在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，积极发扬共产主义大协作的高尚风格，无私地全面地支援全国各地新兴的石油探区。
    两年来，玉门油矿向全国各新探区和兄弟石油厂矿输送的优秀职工达一万三千多人，支援成套的钻探、炼油等机器设备和材料达一万八千多吨。今年，玉门油矿在石油工业部的统筹安排下，组织了更大规模的支援活动，调动了50％的施工力量和51％的建筑安装、机械动力设备和整套的施工工具，支援了七个省、市的兄弟单位，帮助兄弟单位克服基本建设中和生产中的困难。由于玉门油矿全体职工把支援作为自己最光荣的任务，因此把最优秀的职工抽出支援新探区。两年来，支援各地一万三千多名职工中，科级以上领导骨干、工程技术人员就占一千多名。支援的人员还包括勘探、采油、炼油、油田建设、机械、水电、运输等各个工种，做到了组织配套，人员配套，为新探区的建设、生产的全面发展提供了重要物质条件。他们并且以最好的钻井队，最优秀的职工支援兄弟单位。如支援给兄弟单位的王进喜钻井队、薛国邦采油队和盛爱邦修井队等，都是该局几年来重点培养起来的先进集体。在开发老君庙油田中，年年都出色地完成了国家计划，成为石油工业战线上的著名标兵。
    在器材设备方面，玉门油矿也是把最好最新的，甚至自己最急需的抽出来支援外地。去年，克拉玛依油田产量急剧上升，迅速扩大原油处理量是当时急需解决的关键问题，玉门油矿便立即把自己建成的尚未投入生产的一座炼油厂的整套减压设备调给他们，对克拉玛依新油田扩大产品的质量起了很大的作用。今年以来，玉门油矿又将大批成套的钻探、采油、修井、电气设备和各种机械动力、工具材料等源源运往支援新的石油探区。这些器材设备在启运之前，都经过了详细的检查和试运转。在支援时，考虑到新探区修理力量薄弱，先后抽出支援新探区的四十多部电焊机，都是本着克己让人的精神，从好的设备中精选好的送给别人。此外，他们还通过现场会议、代为培训技术工人和组织经验推广队等方式，热情地毫无保留地向兄弟单位传授自己最新的技术经验，提供各种技术资料，尽一切力量帮助新探区解决技术方面的困难。仅在最近两年内，就给兄弟厂矿传播重要技术经验五百五十多项，提供技术资料四万多件。
