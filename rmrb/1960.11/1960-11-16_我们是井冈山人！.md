    “We are Jinggangshan People!”
    Lü Yunsong
    Recently, an old general who had participated in the Jinggangshan struggle returned to Jinggangshan for a few days of visits. In Dajing, he had cordial conversations with old revolutionary comrades such as Zou Wenkai, the former riot captain, and Yu Zhenkun, the chairman of the township Soviet, as well as some young builders. He spoke about the construction of the new city of Ciping, the industrial area of Shishikou, and the construction of the four highways, as well as all the changes in the places he was familiar with, and gave everyone enthusiastic praise. When Zou Wenkai told him that he had spent a winter on Huangyangjie, and that the Huangyangjie highway was basically completed in just one winter, he asked with concern, "Ah? The wind and snow on Huangyangjie are very heavy, can your body handle it?" Zou Wenkai said, "You know, we Jinggangshan people are always like this..." The general nodded and smiled, then asked a young girl, "Where are you from?" She replied quickly, "I am also a Jinggangshan person!"
    "Your accent is not right, are you from Shanghai?"
    "No!" Everyone said almost at the same time:
    "We are Jinggangshan people!"
    The phrase "We are Jinggangshan people" was spoken simultaneously in many local dialects, including the Hakka and indigenous languages of Jinggangshan, as well as Northeastern, Sichuanese, Yunnanese, Shanghai, and Shaanxi dialects. The general stroked his white hair and laughed heartily, saying, "Yes, although my home is in Hunan, I am also a Jinggangshan person!" The general, who came from Jinggangshan, fully understood the meaning of the term "Jinggangshan person."
    "Jinggangshan person" is no longer a symbol of local origin, but a glorious and noble title. "Jinggangshan person" refers to those who have been personally taught by Chairman Mao, and who inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition; it refers to those who work hard, strive for progress, dare to struggle, and dare to win; it refers to those whose minds are as firm as Jinggangshan, whose hearts are as broad as the blue sky, whose will is as strong as a rock, and whose character is as resilient as a cedar.
    Take Zou Wenkai, for example. More than thirty years ago, when Chairman Mao lived in Dajing, he was the riot captain of Dajing Township. Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, he fought local tyrants, distributed land, suppressed gentry, defended the red regime, and turned the world upside down. He served as a scout, ran transportation, guarded Huangyangjie, and crossed the Eight Sides Mountain, risking his life for the revolution. Today, his heroic spirit is undiminished. He was elected as the production team leader, a model in labor. He was elected as the militia captain and attended the National Militia Congress. I won't talk about his outstanding achievements in accumulating more than 150 loads of fertilizer a day in the cold wind and rain, while also traveling 120 miles back and forth, nor will I talk about his touching example of going down to the fields immediately after getting off the bus from Beijing. I will only mention one ordinary thing among the many things that everyone praises him for:
    Jinggangshan is a place with high mountains and cold water, and a large amount of lime is needed in the fields every year. Last year, in order to increase grain production, the brigade decided to burn 300,000 catties of lime. To burn so much lime, more limestone is needed. However, mining limestone is the most difficult and dangerous task in Dajing. Because the limestone at the entrance of Dajing Village is a steep rock wall, scaffolding two or three zhang high must be erected before a hammer can be used. A little carelessness could cause someone to fall. Zou Wenkai had fallen once. Because he was older, the branch did not allow him to do the stone mining work. As soon as he heard this news, he went to the branch secretary: "What? You think I'm too old? My back can even hold a car!" The branch secretary said that they had decided to replace him with two young men. He insisted, "No, young people are careless, won't something happen? Let me go." The branch secretary couldn't dissuade him and let him go. Don't think that mining so many stones is an easy task. This is not a place for blasting mountains with cannons; it must be knocked down hammer by hammer. Zou Wenkai wielded an eight-pound sledgehammer, standing on a steep wall several zhang high, working all day long. Whether it was sunny, rainy, a morning when the north wind was like a sword, or a dusk when the flying snow was like a knife, he was unwilling to rest even slightly. The north wind roared like a beast, pouncing on him; the flying snow, like a boundless silver flood, surged toward him. Large trees were uprooted, and the mountains were swallowed by snow. Only he remained still, swinging the eight-pound sledgehammer, "Bang! Bang! Bang!..." hitting it blow by blow, like a statue carved from white jade. At this time, if someone asked you who was stronger, him or the cedar growing on the rock beside him, you would definitely answer without hesitation: Zou Wenkai! Because the pine tree was finally surrounded by ice and snow, while Zou Wenkai shattered the wind and snow!
    In this way, hammer after hammer, day after day, hammering tens of thousands of times a day, he worked continuously for two months, successfully completing the task of mining 500,000 catties of stone. When everyone talked about this year's bumper harvest, they couldn't help but tell the visiting old general about this. The old general took Zou Wenkai's big, rough hand, like pine bark, and said, "Old comrade, please pay more attention to your health!" Zou Wenkai smiled gratefully and said, "Thank you, chief. Everyone tells me to rest more, but I can't stop! You see, the place where Chairman Mao lived has been repaired, and the two trees are still so lush. When I see these, I think of Chairman Mao. More than thirty years ago, he taught us to work hard and fight for a worker-peasant world. Now Chairman Mao is calling on us to strive for progress and build a strong socialist country. Can I not do more?"
    When leaving, the general said to everyone earnestly, "Young people, to be Jinggangshan people, you must learn more from such old revolutionaries!"
    As the old general instructed, these young builders are learning diligently. They call themselves "Jinggangshan people," on the one hand, to express their determination to build the mountainous area for life and their sense of pride in building Jinggangshan, and on the other hand, to encourage and鞭策 [鞭策 means to spur on] themselves to become true Jinggangshan people. They carry trees on icy mountains, reclaim wasteland in snowy fields, build power stations, build new cities, graze sheep in deep mountains, sleep in the jungle... They never put difficulties in their eyes.
    The Second Team of the Ciping Reclamation Farm is composed of cadres who have been sent down from provincial-level organizations. They are brave and tenacious, always taking the lead, and facing difficulties like tigers. One afternoon, they were reclaiming wasteland on Aobei Mountain, where the Red Army had reclaimed land before. The north wind was howling, and it suddenly started to snow. Some people felt cold and hungry, and it was time to get off work and should leave. However, because burning wasteland and digging out tree stumps had delayed them in the morning, the task had not been completed. Everyone was unwilling to stop working. The snow was getting heavier and heavier, but they were working harder and harder. The heavy snow fell on their bodies, immediately melting with their sweat and flowing down. The steaming heat was swept away by the thick fog, and it was no longer possible to distinguish between the sweat and the fog. They rushed forward, rushed forward, all the way to the highest peak of Jinggangshan! They didn't go home for dinner until they had overfulfilled their task in the evening. As soon as they picked up their rice bowls, a fire alarm suddenly sounded. It turned out that a fire had broken out on the mountain past Tuling. Everyone put down their bowls together and ran to the burning mountain. One after another, they crossed several steep slopes and dangerous ridges of forty or fifty degrees, climbed over thirty or forty miles of mountain roads, and before they could catch their breath, they rushed towards the raging fire. But to stop the spread of the fire, it was necessary to cut down the thatch. Some comrades did not bring machetes. Seeing that the fire was coming, they closed their eyes and rolled onto the thatch mixed with thorns that was about to catch fire, using the weight of their bodies to press down the thatch.
    They not only have the courage to go through fire and water, but also the courage and insight to dare to struggle and dare to win. They dare to build a several hundred-kilowatt power station with a few chipped hoes, build a forestry chemical factory with a machete, refine high-grade fragrance oil with a few wooden steamers, and open up a forestry base with a few broken axes. ... Speaking of this, one cannot but mention Tang Shaoyue.
    Tang Shaoyue was formerly a lieutenant in the volunteer army's engineering corps, a passionate young man. One early winter afternoon, Tang Shaoyue received a task: to open up a base and cut and transport 300,000 mao bamboo poles. The location was in the Gaoshan Daba area, more than sixty miles away from Ciping, and the tools were two borrowed broken saws. Cutting down 300,000 mao bamboo poles was easy, but how to transport them out? If you carried them on your shoulders from the mountain to the river, even two hundred strong men would not be able to carry them all in two years. What to do? It was necessary to build a bamboo slide more than ten miles long to slide the mao bamboo directly from the top of the mountain to the river. However, building a slide more than ten miles long in the deep mountains was easier said than done! One mountain peak was higher than another, and one canyon was deeper than another. How could it be built? There were no tools or equipment, no steel bars or wire, not even iron nails. Could it be built? Tang Shaoyue had never even wielded a machete before, let alone had any experience. However, when a communist party member accepts a task, he does not consider whether it can be completed, but considers how to complete it. When a Jinggangshan person faces a task, he does not count the difficulties or talk about the difficulties, but extends his fist to knock down the difficulties and achieve victory. When people talked about the difficulties, he smiled and said, "Chairman Mao led a thousand people to Jinggangshan and liberated all of China. We are just cutting some mao bamboo, and we already have two saws, which is not bad."
    He led two hundred Jinggangshan people - sent-down cadres, transferred military officers, a few young women, and laborers - through several hard battles, kicking away numerous obstacles, and the slide was built. However, it could not be opened to traffic yet. In places that were too steep, the bamboo rafts slid too fast and derailed in a short time; while in places that were flatter, they could not slide at all, like a broken car that had broken down. ... A bamboo slide more than ten miles long had countless faults of all kinds. However, no matter how many difficulties there were, as many as the bamboo knots on the mountain of mao bamboo, Tang Shaoyue and his comrades were a sharp bamboo splitter, specializing in splitting bamboo. In the wind and rain, on ice and snow, their figures were everywhere. Day and night, awake and in dreams, when were they not thinking about the bamboo slide? After another week of hard work, they solved countless difficulties, but the slide still could not run smoothly. The fourteen sharp turns around the canyon cut the slide into fifteen sections. It was like fifteen sharp knives inserted into Lao Tang's heart. The Spring Festival was approaching. If the slide was not opened to traffic before the Spring Festival, the problem would become even more serious if the laborers left. Lao Tang racked his brains for it. His eye sockets were deep, and his eyes were red. This day, he and several comrades sat by the canyon and studied for a long time, but still without results. He stared blankly at the canyon, lost in thought. A young man said, "Lao Tang, let's study it again!" The labor squad leader, Lao Hu, retorted, "What's there to study? A straight slide is fine, but a curved one is not." The young man was also angry: "Isn't that nonsense? How can you cross a canyon that is dozens of zhang deep? Unless you put wings on the bamboo rafts and fly over!" Lao Tang suddenly looked up, looked at the young man, and then looked at the sky above the canyon. A golden sentence flashed before his eyes: "A bridge flies across, turning a natural chasm into a thoroughfare." He shouted loudly, "I have a way!" "What?" "Fly over it, build a bridge!"
    The decision to build a bridge was made. However, building fourteen bridges dozens of meters high without steel bars, cement, wire, or even an iron nail, was it so easy to build? It was not easy, but it must be built well. Our mountain area builders are people that the Party and the motherland can rely on. Lao Tang said firmly, "What steel bars and iron nails! We have them all over the mountain. Splitting them into strips is wire, and sharpening bamboo nails is iron nails!"
    There is no need to list the various difficulties in building the bridge again. You must believe that these Jinggangshan people cannot be stopped by any difficulties. After several battles, the slide was completed ahead of schedule. The thirteen-mile bamboo slide, like a long dragon, danced in the east wind, winding through dozens of mountain peaks, continuously sending tens of thousands of mao bamboo poles to all parts of the motherland. At this time, the builders of Jinggangshan, with happy smiles and heroic songs, were building several simple sheds on another high mountain, and were emerging in the high mountains, dense forests, cold winds, and flying snow for another batch of new buildings to appear on the land of the motherland…
    These are all Jinggangshan people. They include old heroes from the land revolution period, sent-down cadres who have just left their desks, transferred military officers who have just put down their guns, and little girls who have just left their mothers' arms. If you ask them where they are from, they will proudly answer, "We are Jinggangshan people!" If you ask them if they are suffering by spending all day in the clouds and fog, eating snow and drinking wind, they will say without hesitation, "It's hard, but we are happy! In the past, Chairman Mao led the Red Army to endure hardships and won the liberation of the whole country. Today, with Chairman Mao's leadership, the people of the whole country will endure a few more years of hardship, and our country can be built into a strong socialist country!"
    Dear Party! Please give them more tasks! Dear motherland, please give them more heavy burdens! They were, are, and will always be the good sons and daughters of the Party and the motherland, and they will unconditionally complete their tasks victoriously. If you ask them why they can shoulder such heavy burdens, they will answer loudly, "We are Jinggangshan people!"

    “我们是井冈山人！”
    吕云松
    最近，一位曾经参加过井冈山斗争的老将军，回到井冈山作了几天的访问。在大井的时候，同当年暴动队长邹文楷、乡苏维埃主席余振坤等老革命同志以及一些年轻的建设者们作了亲切的交谈。他谈到茨坪新城的建设，石狮口工业区和四条公路的建设，以及他所熟悉的地方的一切变化，对大家作了热情的赞扬。当邹文楷告诉他：自己曾在黄洋界上度过了一个冬天，黄洋界公路仅在一个冬天就基本修好的时候，他关切地问道：“啊？黄洋界的风雪大得很，你身体吃得消吗？”邹文楷说：“你晓得，我们井冈山人总是这样的……”将军点点头微笑着，接着问一个年轻的姑娘说：“你是哪里人？”她风快地回答说：“我也是井冈山人！”
    “口音不对呀，是个上海人吧？”
    “不！”大家几乎同时说：
    “我们是井冈山人！”
    “我们是井冈山人”这句话，是用许多地方的方言同时说的，有井冈山的客籍和土籍话，有东北话、四川话、云南话，也有上海话、陕西话。将军一抚白发纵声大笑说：“对，虽然我的家在湖南，我也是井冈山人啊！”出身于井冈山的将军，是完全理解“井冈山人”这个词的含义的。
    “井冈山人”已经不是表示地方籍贯的标志了，它是一个光荣的、高贵的称号。“井冈山人”，是指那些亲自受到毛主席的教导，继承并发扬着光荣革命传统的人们；是指那些艰苦奋斗、发愤图强、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的人们；是指那些思想像井冈山般坚定、心胸像蓝天般宽广、意志像岩石般刚强、性格像雪松般坚韧的人们。
    就说邹文楷吧，三十多年前，当毛主席住在大井的时候，他是大井乡的暴动队长，在毛主席亲自领导下，他打土豪，分田地，镇压劣绅，保卫红色政权，闹得天翻地复；做侦察、跑交通，守黄洋界、越八面山，为革命出生入死。今天，他英武不减当年。他被选为生产大队长，是劳动中的模范；他被选为民兵队长，出席了全国民兵群英会。这里不说他在寒风冷雨中一天积肥一百五十多担，还要来回跑一百二十里路的出色成绩，也不说他从北京回来一下汽车就下田的动人事例。只说他许多为大家称道的事情中的一件普通的事：
    井冈山是个山高水冷的地方，田里每年都要下大量的石灰。去年为了增产粮食，大队决定要烧三十万斤石灰。烧这么多石灰，就要更多的石灰石。而采石灰石，在大井来说，是一件最困难最危险的工作。因为大井村口的石灰岩，是一座陡削的石壁，必须搭两三丈高的脚手架才能下得锤子。一不小心就要摔下来，邹文楷就曾经摔过一次。支部因为他年纪大了，就不让他担任采石工作了。他一听到这个消息就去找支书：“怎么？嫌我老了？我腰板上都过得汽车呢！”支部书记说，已经决定换两个年轻人去了。他坚持说：“不，年轻人毛毛草草，就不会出事吗？还是让我去吧。”支部书记拗不过他，还是让他去了。你不要以为采这么些石头是很容易的事。这里不是放炮炸山的，必须是一锤一锤地往下敲。邹文楷抡着八磅重的大锤，站在几丈高的陡壁上一天到晚地工作着。不论天晴，不论下雨，不论是北风似剑的清晨，不论是飞雪如刀的黄昏，他都不愿稍作休息。北风像野兽般地咆哮着，向他猛扑过来，飞雪像无边的银色的洪峰，向他冲击过来，大树被连根拔起，群山被白雪吞没，只有他安然不动，抡着八磅大锤，“碰！碰！碰！……”一下一下地打着，就像一尊白玉雕成的塑像。这时，假如有人问你，他和身旁的长在岩石上的雪松谁更坚强，你一定会毫不犹豫地回答：邹文楷！因为松树终于被冰雪包围了，而邹文楷却把风雪击得粉碎！
    就这样，一锤又一锤，一日又一日，每天要捶几万锤，连续打了两个月，胜利地完成采石五十万斤的任务。当大家谈到今年的丰收的时候，禁不住要把这件事告诉来访的老将军。老将军拉着邹文楷的像松树皮一般的粗糙的大手说：“老同志，要多注意身体啊！”邹文楷感激地笑了笑说：“多谢你首长，大家也叫我多休息，可是我歇不下来呀！你看，毛主席住的地方已经修好了，那两株树还是那么青葱，我看到这些就想起毛主席。三十多年前，他教导我们艰苦奋斗，打出一个工农天下来。现在毛主席又号召我们发愤图强，建设社会主义强国，我不多出力还行？”
    临走的时候，将军语重意长地对大家说：“青年人，要做井冈山人，得多向这样的老革命学习啊！”
    正如老将军的教导，这些年轻的建设者是在兢兢业业地学习着。他们自称“井冈山人”，一方面是表示终生建设山区的决心与建设井冈山的自豪感，另一方面也是以此激励、鞭策自己，使自己成为一个真正的井冈山人。他们上冰山扛树，下雪地开荒，修电站，建新城，深山牧羊，丛林露宿……从来不把困难放在眼下。
    茨坪垦殖分场有个二小队，是省级机关的下放干部组成的。他们勇敢顽强，事事跑到前头，见了困难就像老虎一样。有一天下午，他们正在红军开过荒的坳背山上开荒，北风呼呼，忽然下起雪来。有的人觉得又冷又饿，又到了收工时间，应该收工了。但是因为上午烧荒、挖树兜耽搁了时间，任务还没有完成。大家都不愿意收工。雪越下越大了，他们却越干越起劲了，大雪飞在身上，立即和汗珠融在一起往下流，腾腾热气被大雾卷走，再也分不清那是汗气那是雾气了。只见它们奔腾，奔腾，一直奔向井冈山的最高峰！他们直到傍晚超额完成任务才回家吃饭。刚一端上饭碗，突然一阵火警锣响，原来土岭过去的山上失火了。大家一齐放下碗，往失火的山头飞奔。一个追一个，翻过几个四、五十度的陡坡险岭，爬过三、四十里的山路，没等喘过气来，便向烈火猛扑过去。但要制止烈火的蔓延，一定要砍倒茅草。有的同志没有带柴刀，眼看着火头来了，便闭着眼睛，往即将着火的、夹着乱刺的茅草上滚去，用身体的重量将茅草压倒。
    他们不但有赴汤蹈火的勇气，而且有着敢于斗争、敢于胜利的胆略。他们敢于凭几把缺口锄头修建几百瓩的发电站，凭一把柴刀建立一座林业化工厂，凭几个木甑炼出高级香料油，凭几把破斧开辟一个林业基地。……讲到这里，不能不谈到唐少岳。
    唐少岳过去是志愿军的工兵中尉，一个热情洋溢的青年人。有个初冬下午，唐少岳领来一个任务：开辟一个基地，砍运三十万根茅竹。地点是离茨坪六十多里地的高山大坝里，工具是两把借来的破锯。三十万根茅竹，砍倒是好办的，如何运出来呢？若用肩膀从山上扛到河边，给你两百大力士，两年也扛不完。怎么办？一定要修一个十几里长的竹滑道，把茅竹从山顶直接滑到河里去。然而，在深山里修一座十几里长的滑道，谈何容易！山头一座比一座高，峡谷一个比一个深，怎么个修法？既没有工具器材，又没有钢筋铁丝，甚至连铁钉也没有，能修成吗？唐少岳在上山前，连柴刀也没有挥过，更谈不到什么经验了。然而，一个共产党员接受一项任务的时候，不是考虑能否完成，而是考虑如何去完成；一个井冈山人，对待任务不是去数着困难，谈论困难，而是伸出拳头打倒困难，取得胜利。当人家说到困难的时候，他笑笑说：“毛主席带一千人上井冈山，解放了全中国，我们不过砍点茅竹，有两把锯子，已经不少了。”
    他领着两百名井冈山人——下放干部、转业军官、几位青年姑娘和民工，经过几番苦战，踢开重重障碍，滑道修好了。但是，还不能通车。太陡的地方，竹排滑得太快，一会儿就出轨了；而较平的地方，却又滑不动，像一辆抛锚的破车一样。……十几里长的竹滑道，各种各样的故障何止千百条？然而，任何困难再多，多得像满山茅竹的竹节一样，唐少岳和他的战友们却是一把锋利的篾刀，是专门破竹子的。风里雨里，冰上雪上，处处都有他们的身影，白天黑夜，醒来梦中，什么时候不是想的竹滑道？又苦战了一个星期，解决了无数难关，滑道还是不能畅通。这十四个绕过峡谷的急转弯，把滑道截成十五截。这像是十五把尖刀插在老唐心里。春节快到了，如果不在春节前使滑道畅通，民工一走，问题就更严重了。老唐为它绞尽了脑汁，眼窝深了，眼珠也红了。这天又和几个同志坐在峡谷旁研究了半天，仍然没有结果，他直望着峡谷呆呆地出神。一个小伙子说：“老唐，再研究一下吧！”民工连长老胡顶他说：“还研究个屁！滑道就是直的行，弯的不行。”小伙子也气了：“这不是废话吗？几十丈深的峡谷怎么过得去？除非叫竹排插上翅膀飞过去！”老唐猛一抬头，望望那个小伙子，又看看峡谷上空，一个金色的句子在眼前一闪：“一桥飞架，南北天堑变通途。”他大声叫道：“有办法了！”“怎么？”“飞过去，架桥！”
    架桥的事决定了。然而，架十四座几十米高的桥，没有钢筋水泥，没有一根铁丝，一枚铁钉，是那么容易架好吗？不容易，但是一定要架好。我们的山区建设者，是党和祖国可以信赖的人。老唐坚定地说：“什么钢筋铁钉！我们满山都是，破成篾子就是铅丝，削成竹钉就是铁钉！”
    用不着再列举架桥中的种种困难，你一定相信这些井冈山人是任何困难都阻挡不了的。几场战斗之后，滑道提前竣工了。十三里竹滑道，像一条长龙，迎着东风飞舞，在几十个山头绕弯穿行，将数以万计的茅竹，源源不绝地送到祖国各地。这时候，井冈山建设者们带着幸福的笑容，豪迈的歌声，又在另一座高山上搭起了几座简陋的工棚，正在为祖国的土地上出现另一批新的大厦，出没于高山密林寒风飞雪之中……
    这些都是井冈山人，他们有土地革命时期的老英雄，有才离开办公桌的下放干部，有刚放下枪杆的转业军官，有才离开妈妈怀抱的小姑娘。要问他们是哪里人？他们会自豪地回答：“我们是井冈山人！”要问他们成天在云里穿，雾里转，餐雪饮风苦不苦？他们会毫不迟疑地说：“苦，但是我们高兴！过去，毛主席领导红军吃苦，争得了全国解放；今天有毛主席领导，全国人民再苦他几年，我国就可以建成一个社会主义强国！”
    亲爱的党啊！请多交给他们一些任务吧！亲爱的祖国啊，请多给他们一些重担吧！他们过去是、现在是并将永远是党和祖国的好儿女，他们会毫无条件地胜利完成任务。要问他们为什么能担得起那么重的担子？他们会响亮地回答：“我们是井冈山人！”
