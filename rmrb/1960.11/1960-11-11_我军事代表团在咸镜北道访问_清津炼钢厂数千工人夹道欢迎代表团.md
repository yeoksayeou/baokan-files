Xinhua News Agency, Chongjin, 10th. The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, led by Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing, accompanied by Vice-Premier of the Korean Cabinet, Zheng Zhunze, and Vice-Minister of National Defense, General Cui Yongjin, spent today touring the famous scenic spot in North Hamgyong Province, the Juul Hot Springs.

This evening, the masses in the Juul Hot Springs area held a joint celebration to warmly welcome the delegation. The guests and hosts were filled with a feeling of reluctance to part, and enjoyed themselves together. A large red banner at the front of the venue read: "Long Live the Eternal Friendship Between the Korean and Chinese People." The delegation visited the Chongjin Steel Mill on the 9th.

Thousands of workers from this factory, holding bouquets and national flags of Korea and China, lined the three-li route to welcome the Chinese guests. A large slogan was hung on the tall iron frame of the No. 3 converter of the factory, which read: "Long Live the Militant Friendship Between the Peoples of Korea and China."

During the visit to the No. 3 converter workshop, Comrade Kim Sun-ho, the director of Chongjin Steel Mill, introduced to the Chinese guests that the converters in this factory do not use imported coke, but use domestic anthracite coal to produce granular iron for refining high-quality steel, with an average daily output of more than 90 tons per converter. General Luo Ruiqing said: "Your experience in refining granular iron with anthracite coal is worth learning for us, and we wish you greater achievements."

After the visit, both sides exchanged gifts.

    我军事代表团在咸镜北道访问
    清津炼钢厂数千工人夹道欢迎代表团
    新华社清津10日电　由贺龙元帅、罗瑞卿大将率领的中国访朝军事友好代表团由朝鲜内阁副首相郑准泽、民族保卫省副相崔勇进上将陪同，今天在咸镜北道著名胜地——朱乙温泉游览了一天。
    今天晚上，朱乙温泉一带的群众还举行联欢晚会，热烈欢迎代表团。宾主间怀着难舍难分的心情，在一起欢乐。会场正面的红布大幅横额上写着“朝中人民友谊万古长青”。代表团于9日曾参观访问了清津炼钢厂。
    这个工厂的数千工人高举着花束和朝中两国的国旗，排成三华里的行列，夹道欢迎中国客人。工厂的三号转炉的高大的铁架上悬挂着大幅标语，上面写着：“朝中两国人民间的战斗友谊万岁”。
    在三号转炉车间参观时，清津炼钢厂厂长金淳浩同志向中国客人介绍说，这个工厂的转炉不用进口的焦炭，它们用本国的无烟煤就能炼出供炼优质钢用的粒铁，每一座转炉平均日产量达九十吨以上。罗瑞卿大将说：“你们用无烟煤炼粒铁的经验值得我们学习，祝你们取得更大的成绩。”
    参观访问后，双方互赠了礼品。
