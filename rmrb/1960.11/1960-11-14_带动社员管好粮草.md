    Leading Commune Members to Manage Grain and Fodder Well
    Comrade Xia Shihai, who worked in our commune party committee, has been participating in production and leading production in the Sunzhuang Brigade for two months. He actively participates in production, insists on eating, living, working, and consulting with commune members, and pays special attention to leading commune members to conserve grain and firewood.
    The Sunzhuang Brigade has a total of eight grain storage warehouses. After a day of work, Xia Shihai always runs to each warehouse to check it. Once he found rats in the warehouses of the first and third production teams. Xia Shihai felt that this was a major loophole in grain loss, so he calculated the detailed account of grain loss caused by rats with the storekeeper, making the storekeeper realize that this was not a small matter. Xia Shihai and the warehouse keepers of each warehouse launched commune members to catch and kill rats on one hand, and concentrated the grain in warehouses without rats for storage on the other hand. According to calculations, by plugging this loophole, the entire brigade can reduce grain loss by more than 1,000 catties.
    One day, Xia Shihai came to the threshing ground of the third production team and saw that the dried straw stalks were placed in a mess, resulting in a great loss, and at the same time, the quality of the straw stalks was reduced due to sun and night dew. In response to this situation, he explained the principles of "every grain returned to the granary, and every straw returned to the stack" through the production team cadre meeting. The production teams attached importance to this work and transferred manpower to stack the straw stalks into large stacks, with net bags covered on top.

    带动社员管好粮草
    在我们公社党委会工作的夏士海同志下放到孙庄大队参加生产、领导生产已经有两个月了。他积极参加生产，坚持跟社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，并且特别注意带动社员节约粮食和柴草。
    孙庄大队共有八个保管粮食的仓库，夏士海在一天劳动完了以后，总是跑到各个仓库查看一遍。有一次他发现第一、三生产队的仓库里有老鼠。夏士海感到这是粮食损耗的一个大漏洞，就和保管员一起算因老鼠为害损耗粮食的细账，使保管认识到这不是一件小事。夏士海和各个仓库的管库员一面发动社员捕打老鼠，一面把粮食都集中在没有老鼠的仓库里保管。据计算，由于堵了这个漏洞，全大队可以减少粮食的损耗一千多斤。
    有一天，夏士海来到了第三生产队的场头，看到晒干的草秸放得很乱，损失很大，同时，由于日晒夜露，降低了草秸的质量。他针对这个情况，通过生产小队干部会，讲明了颗粒归仓、寸草归垛的道理。各生产小队重视了这项工作，抽调人力把草秸垛成了大垛，上面盖好了网包。
