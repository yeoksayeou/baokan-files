Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 21st: The eighth session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea recessed yesterday and continued with plenary speeches today. More than ten deputies, including Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myeong-hui and Lee Joo-yeon, spoke at the meeting today.

	In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister Hong Myeong-hui pointed out that the fact that the Korean people have been separated between the North and the South for fifteen years and unable to communicate with each other is the fault of American imperialism. The withdrawal of American imperialism from South Korea is the first step towards the peaceful reunification of Korea. Therefore, the struggle against American imperialism must be strengthened. He said, "We are now negotiating with the Americans in Panmunjom. Why can't we, as a nation, discuss our own problems among ourselves, but have to hand them over to the Americans for discussion?" He said that the current rulers of South Korea talk glibly about "reunification," but they say they want "reunification" under the supervision of the United Nations, which is essentially opposition to reunification. He called on the people and patriots of South Korea to mobilize and intensify their struggle for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

	In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Joo-yeon outlined the bankruptcy of industry and agriculture in South Korea under the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys, and also reported in detail on the great achievements made in industry, agriculture, science, and culture in North Korea under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Prime Minister Kim Il-sung. He said that if the economic conditions of North and South Korea are fully utilized, they can be completely self-reliant, change the poverty and hunger in South Korea, and solve the unemployment problem in South Korea.

	Kang Ryang-wook, Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Party, called on South Korean Christians to unite and fight for the new plan for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland put forward by Prime Minister Kim Il-sung and Chairman Choi Yong-kun. He said that the paradise that Christians hope for has already been realized in North Korea. However, the South Korean people's desire for a new politics, a new system, and a new leadership has not yet been realized. This is caused by the aggressive and colonial policies of American imperialism. He said that the struggle launched by South Korean students against the American colonizers Underwood and Sauer is not accidental, but an eruption of the rising anti-American sentiment among the South Korean people. American colonizers are wolves disguised as "educators" and "pastors." From the dirty history of Underwood alone, it can be seen how American imperialism uses religion to invade Korea.

	In his speech, Oh Hyun-joo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, pointed out that the wolfish nature of American imperialism cannot be changed. He also said that the struggle of South Korean youth against American imperialism and its lackeys is just. Only by continuing the struggle can victory be achieved.

	In his speech, Kim Doo-sam, Vice Chairman of the Heavy Industry Commission, reported on the significant achievements made in the development of industry in North Korea and pointed out that the peaceful reunification plan we have put forward is based on the wishes of the broad masses of the Korean people. He said that artificial obstacles can temporarily divide Korea into North and South, but the flesh-and-blood relationship of the Korean nation cannot be severed.

	In his speech, Bai Nanyun, President of the Academy of Sciences, pointed out that it was American imperialism that instigated Japanese imperialism to invade Korea, and it is still American imperialism that is invading Korea today. American imperialism is not only a political and military aggressor against Korea, but also a cultural aggressor. Many ancient Korean cultural relics have been plundered by American imperialism. The decadent culture of American imperialism is increasingly corroding our national culture.

	Li Il-kyung, Minister of Education and Culture, and Han Xue-ye, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Writers' Alliance, also spoke at the meeting today.

	At today's meeting, two proposals put forward by Li Seung-ki and Kim Doo-sam were unanimously approved, and a drafting committee composed of twenty-three people, including Hong Myeong-hui, Park Kim-cheol, Jeong Il-ryong, and Lee Jong-ok, was elected to draw up a "Letter from the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's

    洪命熹、李周渊等在最高人民会议上发言
    加强反美斗争才能实现朝鲜和平统一
    新华社平壤21日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第八次会议昨天休会一天，今天进行大会发言。今天在会上发言的有朝鲜内阁副首相洪命熹和李周渊等十多位议员。
    副首相洪命熹在发言中指出，朝鲜人民十五年来分居南北，不能来往，造成这种情况的罪魁是美帝国主义。美帝国主义从南朝鲜撤走是朝鲜和平统一的第一步。因此，必须加强反对美帝国主义的斗争。他说，我们现在和美国人在板门店谈判，为什么自己民族间的问题自己不能协商，而要交给美国人去讨论呢？他说，现在的南朝鲜统治者侈谈
  “统一”，但是说要在联合国监督下的“统一”，这实质上是反对统一。他号召南朝鲜人民和爱国人士为和平统一祖国动员起来，加紧斗争。
    副首相李周渊在发言中概述了南朝鲜在美帝国主义及其走狗统治下工农业的破产景况，还详细地报告了朝鲜北部在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相英明领导下在工业、农业、科学文化各方面取得的巨大成就。他说，如果充分利用朝鲜南、北部的经济条件，可以完全自力更生，改变南朝鲜贫困、饥饿的情况，能够解决南朝鲜的失业问题。
    北朝鲜民主党中央委员会委员长康良煜在发言中代表北朝鲜民主党号召南朝鲜基督教人团结起来，为实现金日成首相、崔庸健委员长提出的和平统一祖国的新方案而斗争。他说，基督教人希望的乐园在朝鲜北部已经实现了。可是南朝鲜人民要求新政治、新制度、新领导的愿望至今没有实现。这是美帝国主义的侵略政策和殖民地政策所造成的。他说，南朝鲜学生掀起的反对美国殖民者恩德乌德、萨乌尔的斗争不是偶然的，这是南朝鲜人民正在高涨的反美情绪的爆发。美国殖民者是伪装成“教育家”、“牧师”的狼。仅从恩德乌德一个人的肮脏历史中也可以看出美帝国主义怎样利用宗教侵略朝鲜的。
    朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会委员长吴铉周在发言中指出，美帝国主义的狼的本性是不可能改变的。他还说，南朝鲜青年反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争是正义的。只有继续斗争才能取得胜利。
    重工业委员会副委员长金斗三在发言中报告了朝鲜北部在工业发展上取得的重大成就之后指出，我们提出的和平统一方案，是从朝鲜广大人民的心愿出发的。他说，人为的障碍能一时地把朝鲜分成南北，但是朝鲜民族的骨肉之情是割不断的。
    科学院院长白南云在发言中指出：唆使日本帝国主义侵略朝鲜的是美帝国主义，今天侵略朝鲜的还是美帝国主义。美帝国主义不仅是对朝鲜的政治、军事方面的侵略者，也是文化的侵略者。朝鲜很多古代文物被美帝国主义掠夺走了。美帝国主义的颓废的文化日益腐蚀我们的民族文化。
    今天在会上发言的还有教育文化相李一卿、朝鲜作家同盟中央委员会委员长韩雪野等。
    在今天的会议上，一致同意了李升基、金斗三提出的两点建议，并且选出了以洪命熹、朴金喆、郑一龙、李钟玉等二十三人组成的起草委员会，来起草“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议给大韩民国国会、南朝鲜各政党、社会团体和人民的信”和“关于实现南北朝鲜经济文化交流合作和谋求民族经济独立发展的意见书”。
