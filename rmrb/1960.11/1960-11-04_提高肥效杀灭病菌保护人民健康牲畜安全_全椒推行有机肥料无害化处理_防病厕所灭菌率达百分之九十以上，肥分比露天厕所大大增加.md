(Our dispatch from Hefei, November 3rd) The fecal harmlessness research group in Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, has preliminarily researched and successfully tested a set of simple and easy-to-implement comprehensive measures for fecal harmlessness, which can kill insect eggs and germs, and improve fertilizer efficiency, which is of great significance for protecting people's health and promoting agricultural production.

This set of comprehensive measures for harmless fecal treatment is divided into two categories.

The first category is the fundamental measures combining toilets and manure storage. For example, disease-prevention toilets are composed of three round pools (divided into five compartments, with the second and third pools further divided into two compartments each), with pipes connecting the compartments. The first compartment is built with squatting positions and manure intake, and the fifth compartment is for manure removal. The first and fifth compartments are covered, and the second, third, and fourth compartments are sealed. The oxygen-deficient environment created by the sealing and the long-term storage of manure can eliminate germs. The free ammonia produced during the manure decomposition process can kill insect eggs (those that are not killed will settle to the bottom of the pool and die naturally). Observation and experiments show that this type of toilet can kill 90% to 100% of the pathogenic insect eggs of parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, and ascariasis, and the pathogenic bacteria of intestinal infectious diseases such as typhoid fever and dysentery. Chemical analysis shows that the potassium, phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonia, and other components in the harmlessly treated manure are 15% to 86% higher than those in open-air toilets, and vegetable planting experiments show that production can be increased by 12.6% to 65%. There is also an improved toilet, which differs from the disease-prevention toilet in structure, namely that the second and third pools are not further divided into two compartments each. These two types of toilets, due to their brick and mud structure, covered and sealed design, and anti-maggot and odor removal equipment, are conducive to environmental sanitation. However, the time from manure input to fertilizer output takes ten days to a month, which creates a contradiction between harmlessness and the urgent need for fertilizer.

The other category is temporary measures suitable for urgently needed fertilizer, such as the insect egg sedimentation pool, which has a similar structure to the improved toilet, but without squatting positions and is only used for storing manure and sedimenting insect eggs. Manure is poured from the first pool, mixed with water and flows into the third pool. In just eighteen hours, the pathogenic insect eggs of parasitic diseases will settle to the bottom of the first and second pools, and then the basically harmless fertilizer is taken from the third pool (it cannot eliminate the pathogenic bacteria of intestinal infectious diseases).

In addition, there are methods such as high-temperature composting, burning composting, using biological heat, boiling water, and drugs to kill insect eggs and germs. These are all temporary measures for emergency harmlessness. The method of harmlessness with boiling water is to put dry manure into a manure tank, and use boiling water equivalent to one time of the dry manure for impaction and mixing. It only takes six minutes to kill all the insect eggs and germs. The method of harmlessness with biological heat is to surround the manure tank filled with manure with weeds, garbage, and livestock manure. After being exposed to the sun and heated, the temperature in the tank increases to forty to fifty degrees, killing insect eggs and germs. At the same time, the weeds and garbage outside are also converted into fertilizer. High-temperature composting and fire-burning composting are basically similar to this.

At present, Quanjiao County, Jieshou County, Xiao County, and other places in Anhui Province are vigorously promoting it. In the promotion, Quanjiao County has made overall arrangements closely combined with production, achieving local material collection and simple methods, and has also established a regular management system, thus achieving good results.

The fecal harmlessness research group in Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, was established in June 1959 by more than 20 medical personnel from five units, including the Institute of Parasitic Diseases of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Anhui Medical College, Anhui Provincial Institute for Prevention and Control of Endemic Diseases, Bengbu Special District Station for Prevention and Control of Endemic Diseases, and Quanjiao County Health and Epidemic Prevention Station. Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party, all personnel have carried forward the spirit of hard struggle and humbly learned from the masses' experience in managing manure, thus achieving great achievements.

    提高肥效杀灭病菌保护人民健康牲畜安全
    全椒推行有机肥料无害化处理
    防病厕所灭菌率达百分之九十以上，肥分比露天厕所大大增加
    本报合肥3日电　安徽省全椒县粪便无害化研究组，初步研究试验成功一套简便易行的粪便无害化的综合性措施，既能杀灭虫卵病菌，又能提高肥效，对保护人民健康、促进农业生产，具有重大意义。
    这套粪便无害化的综合性措施，分为两大类。
    第一类是厕所和贮粪相结合的根本措施。如防病厕所，是由三个圆池（分为五格，第二、三池再各分为两格）构成的，格与格之间的隔壁上有管道相通。第一格上修建蹲位和进粪，第五格取粪。第一、五格加盖，第二、三、四格密封。密封造成的缺氧环境和粪便的长期贮存，能够消灭病菌，粪便腐熟过程产生的游离氨能杀死虫卵（杀不死的也会沉淀到池底自然灭亡）。经过观察试验，这种厕所对血吸虫、钩虫、蛔虫等寄生虫病的致病虫卵和伤寒、痢疾等肠道传染病的致病菌的杀灭率，可达90％至100％；经过化学分析，经过无害化处理的粪便中的钾、磷、氮、氨等成分比露天厕所的提高15％至86％，经过种菜试验，可增产12.6％至65％。还有一种改良厕所，它与防病厕所不同的是在结构上，即第二、三池中不再各分为两格。这两种厕所，由于砖泥结构、加盖密封、并有防蛆排臭设备，有利环境卫生。但是，从进粪到出肥的时间需要十天到一个月，存在着无害化和急用肥的矛盾。
    另一类是适应于急用肥的临时性措施，如虫卵沉淀池，其结构与改良厕所相似，但没有蹲位，只供贮粪沉淀虫卵使用。粪便从第一池倒入，加水搅拌流进第三池，只需十八小时，寄生虫病的致病虫卵就会沉淀在第一、二池底，然后从第三池取用基本无害化的肥料，（不能消灭肠道传染病的致病菌）。
    此外，还有高温堆肥、火烧堆肥、利用生物热、开水、药物等杀灭虫卵病菌的方法，这都是紧急无害化的临时措施。开水无害化的方法是把干粪盛入粪缸内，用相当于干粪一倍的开水冲击搅拌，仅需六分钟时间，就把虫卵病菌全部杀死。生物热无害化的方法，是把盛满粪便的粪缸，外面用杂草、垃圾、畜粪围住，经太阳一晒发热，缸内温度增加到四十至五十度，杀灭虫卵病菌，同时外面的杂草、垃圾也化为肥料。高温堆肥和火烧堆肥，与此基本相似。
    目前，安徽省全椒县、界首县、萧县等地正在大力推广。全椒县在推广中，紧密结合生产作了统筹安排，做到了就地取材、因陋就简，同时还建立了经常性的管理制度，因此取得了良好效果。
    安徽省全椒县粪便无害化研究组，是1959年6月，由中国医学科学院寄生病研究所、安徽医学院、安徽省地方病防治所、蚌埠专区地方病防治站和全椒县卫生防疫站等五个单位的二十多位医务人员组织成立的。一年多来，在党的领导下，全体人员发扬了艰苦奋斗的作风，并虚心学习群众管理粪便的经验，因此取得了很大成就。
