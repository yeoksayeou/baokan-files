Anshan Iron and Steel Company Transfers Cadres Layer by Layer, Launches Vigorous Mass Movements, Steel Production Increases Every Ten Days
Songyi Mining Bureau Transfers Half of its Office Staff to Work Groups, Encouraging Workers' Enthusiasm, Overall Work Leaps Forward

(Our newspaper, Anshan, 31st dispatch) Anshan Iron and Steel Company is transferring leading cadres layer by layer from the company to various factories, mines, workshops, and work sections to lead and inspire the vast number of employees to promote the sustained leap forward in steel production.

The Anshan Municipal Party Committee and the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Party Committee, in order to adapt to the rapidly developing movement to increase production and practice economy, summarized the leadership experience that emerged since the Great Leap Forward and decided that, while the leading cadres at all levels are "dividing areas of responsibility and contracting work," following shifts, and focusing on key points, they would transfer a batch of leading cadres layer by layer from the company to various factories, mines, and workshops to important posts such as open-hearth furnaces, blast furnaces, and mining, or to weak links such as dispatching, transportation, and machine repair, concurrently serving as party organization secretaries and administrative leaders; and they would transfer a batch of cadres who were originally old workers back to their original production posts to participate in production and lead production, in order to discover and solve problems more deeply and in a timely manner. By mid-October, the company had transferred more than 1,500 leading cadres and cadres who were originally workers at all levels.

After these leading cadres were transferred, they appeared as direct leaders in important positions or weak links, truly sharing the same breath and fate with the employees of their units, and were better able to go deep into reality and into the masses to discover problems; at the same time, because they were members of the higher-level leadership, they stood higher and saw farther, able to grasp key issues, find the root causes of problems, and organize relevant parties to quickly solve them, promoting the continuous and in-depth development of the movement to increase production and practice economy. Zhong Mingwu, deputy director of the Second Steelmaking Plant, after being transferred to the B shift to serve concurrently as the secretary of the Party Work Committee, discovered during a shift that the employees of the 18th open-hearth furnace were afraid that the molten steel ladle would not be ready, affecting steel tapping, so they requested the ingot casting and transportation work section to prepare steel ladles half an hour before steel tapping. As a result, the steel ladles arrived and waited for half an hour, affecting the other open-hearth furnaces in exchanging molten iron and slag ladles. From this matter, which had not attracted attention in the past, he realized that in order to guarantee increased production, it was necessary to consolidate the overall concept of "others first, self last" among all employees. Then, he went deeper into reality and discovered the touching example of the employees of the 16th open-hearth furnace voluntarily letting the 15th open-hearth furnace exchange molten iron first when the 16th and 15th open-hearth furnaces needed to exchange molten iron at the same time. He praised the employees of the 16th furnace at the general meeting of the entire shift and called on all workers to learn the noble style of the 16th furnace employees of giving convenience to others and keeping difficulties for themselves. After that, the phenomenon of affecting the production of brother open-hearth furnaces was greatly reduced, and good conditions were created for the next shift's production. In the first half of October, they were rated as a red flag shift in the four-shift competition.

In the process of working with grassroots cadres, these transferred leading cadres, with their in-depth and meticulous work style, discovered that the key problems were grasped to the end, and the leadership methods of organizing the vast number of employees to overcome key problems became a model for grassroots cadres to learn from, helping the grassroots cadres improve their work level. Hu Jiyao, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the East Anshan Iron Mine, after being transferred to the sintering workshop to serve concurrently as the secretary of the Party General Branch, discovered when studying how to further improve the equipment operation rate that there was a thick layer of dust piled up under the belt conveyor, and in some places the dust had buried the base of the motor, affecting the running speed. If this problem was not dealt with, it was likely to cause equipment accidents. He immediately launched workers to speak out and discuss, and then organized workers to clean up, and he personally drilled under the belt to fight alongside the workers, and the dust was cleaned up in a few days. The style and leadership methods of Secretary Hu Jiyao educated Shen Weijun, deputy director of the workshop. He realized that the reason why Secretary Hu solved problems so quickly and thoroughly was that the key lay in grasping a problem and not letting go, and personally taking the lead in working hard. Therefore, he operated with the workers and exchanged opinions with many workers, and quickly solved the problem of the sintering machine grate that had not been solved for nine months, improving the production efficiency of the sintering machine by about 5%.

Cadres who were originally old workers returning to the front lines have also effectively promoted the continuous advancement of production. Li Guozhong, deputy director of the equipment workshop who was originally an old piping worker in the ironmaking plant, after being transferred to the East Work Zone as a foreman, discovered that the cooling water pressure of the hot blast valve of the 9th blast furnace was insufficient. He immediately repaired two water pumps with the workers, increasing the water pressure from two kilograms to three kilograms, extending the life of the hot blast valve, and clearing obstacles for the 9th blast furnace to increase the hot blast temperature, save coke, and produce more iron. Li Shangzhong, a furnace protection technician and rapid steelmaking expert from the Third Steelmaking Plant, was transferred to the 23rd open-hearth furnace as the chief furnace director. After personally refining two heats of steel, he found that the steelmaking time of this open-hearth furnace was long, and the key was slag removal. The slag outlet was too small, and the slag could not be discharged. He raised this issue at the four-shift joint meeting, and everyone agreed. Then, a competition was launched between the four shifts to improve the slag outlet, shortening the melting time from seven hours to about five hours.

The further improvement of leadership style and the rapid overcoming of production key problems have encouraged the soaring enthusiasm of the vast number of employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. The steel production level in mid-October was significantly higher than in early October, showing a good situation of continuous leap forward with increases every ten days.

(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 31st dispatch) In the movement to increase production and practice economy to seize high coal production in the fourth quarter, the Songyi Mining Bureau in Hubei Province has adopted measures such as transferring cadres and enriching the grassroots to fundamentally improve leadership style, greatly encouraging the revolutionary enthusiasm of the bureau's employees, and promoting the overall leap forward in various tasks such as coal mining, capital construction, and transportation. Since the third quarter, the bureau's coal production has increased month by month, and in the first and middle ten days of October, tunneling, production, and transportation have all exceeded the level of September.

In July of this year, Qiao Jimin, secretary of the Party Committee of the Songyi Mining Bureau, went deep into the Dahekou Coal Mine to help the mine further improve its leadership style and to grasp ideological work, solving the key problems hindering production. This approach immediately yielded results, and the mine's daily output rapidly increased twofold. After the Tangjiadong Coal Mine learned from the experience of the Dahekou Mine, its output also increased twofold. This fact made everyone realize that the improvement of cadres' thinking style has a huge promoting effect on production. In order to further promote the experience of the Dahekou Mine, the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau decided to focus on the Songmuping Mine, which accounts for 80% of the bureau's output, implement the "relocation of the office," and unhesitatingly moved all levels of agencies of the bureau to the Songmuping Mine; then, it further transferred cadres to enrich the grassroots, enabling a large number of cadres to go deep into the front line of production and take root, thus rapidly appearing a production initiative.

The specific approach of this revolutionary measure of the Songyi Mining Bureau is: to merge the original thirteen sections and offices of the bureau and the eleven shares and offices of the mine into four and three offices respectively, and to transfer 50% of the personnel from the bureau and mine level agencies to the pits, teams, and groups. Among them, 50% of the members of the Party Committee of the Mining Bureau were transferred. Some of them served as the general branch secretaries and pit chiefs of the pit mouths, and some served as the captains of the motorcades and farm managers. Seven of the fifteen section-level cadres of the bureau were also transferred to the grassroots to serve as district chiefs of mining areas or production team leaders, group leaders, etc.; the administrative section chiefs were also transferred to be clerks, truly going deep into the production and life site, working and overcoming key problems with the workers. In this way, the temporary organization of cadres to go down to "tackle key problems" was changed into cadres going down to settle down; the "helping" and "visiting" were changed into cadres going down to take specific responsibility and personally implement; and the "watching" of leading cadres was changed into directly "participating" in the command of production, thus greatly promoting production and closer relations between cadres and the masses, and some long-standing problems were quickly resolved. For example, in the past, it took twenty-four hours to move an electric scraper in the 501 mining area of ​​the Fengxiangshu pit, and at the fastest it took eight hours. After Luo Zhongmi, the deputy mine director who was originally a coal miner, was transferred to this place as the mining area director, he reformed the operation with the workers and created a "quick scraper moving method," which solved the problem in two hours, reaching the national advanced level. There was a working face 110 meters long in this mining area, the coal seam was thick, and the roof was good. The longwall mining method was used, but it was not adhered to later. Since Xu Changrong, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Bureau, was transferred to this pit as the general branch secretary and pit chief, he personally went down the well to study with workers and technicians, helped the masses dispel ideological concerns, strengthened safety measures, and re-adopted this method, and the daily output immediately increased by 41.6%. In just ten days, this Fengxiangshu pit overcame 38 key problems of various sizes. Xu Changrong said with deep experience: "There are many benefits to letting go to the end, proving that the Party's teaching that 'cadres go down, work comes up' is a truth." The workers praised the five more and five less after the cadres let go to the end: more in-depth, less floating; more practical work, less pointing fingers; more problem-solving, fewer difficulties; more advanced, less backward; more tasks completed, less underproduction.

The result of cadres going down and enriching the grassroots is that it not only enriched the production force in the well, but also strengthened the leadership of the pits, teams, and groups. Among the cadres transferred by this bureau, 80 people served as team and group leaders, so that the leadership core was generally established and improved in the teams and groups, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses for production. In the current movement to increase production and practice economy, they have carried out a vigorous labor competition, with pit-to-pit, team-to-team, group-to-group, and person-to-person competitions, promoting the overall surge in production. From January to September of this year, raw coal production and coal transportation increased by one time and more than one time respectively compared with the same period last year, and capital construction also increased greatly; after entering October, various indicators have further increased, and in the first and middle ten days of October, the average daily output of raw coal increased by 7.3% compared with the same period in September, the volume of coal transportation increased by 49%, and the daily tunneling footage also continued to increase. At the same time, the quality of coal was guaranteed by implementing the separation of good coal and bad coal and separate loading.

While cadres were being transferred to enrich the grassroots, the Songyi Mining Bureau also adopted methods such as ranking the wells one by one and arranging them reasonably, and successively supplemented 823 auxiliary production personnel on the ground to the well production. In addition to digging three working faces, these people also newly opened three pairs of regular wells and six pairs of small coal kilns. Originally, the Dahekou Coal Mine proposed to increase production by 100 tons of coal, which required an increase of 200 people. After tapping potential and arranging skillfully, not only did it not increase people, but instead it drew 100 people to support other coal mines, and the daily production level increased by 66% compared with the original, realizing the reduction of people and increased production.

    大力加强基层夺取钢煤高产
    鞍钢层层下放干部，大搞群众运动，钢铁旬旬上升
    松宜矿务局半数机关人员下放班组，鼓舞工人干劲，工作全面跃进
    本报鞍山31日电　鞍钢从公司到各厂矿、车间和工段层层下放领导干部，率领和鼓舞广大职工推动钢铁生产持续跃进。
    中共鞍山市委、鞍钢党委适应增产节约运动迅速发展的要求，总结了大跃进以来出现的领导经验，决定在各级领导干部“分片包干”、跟班劳动、狠抓重点的同时，从公司到各厂矿、车间层层下放一批领导干部，到平炉、高炉和采矿等重要岗位，或调度运输和机修等薄弱环节去，兼任党组织书记和行政领导职务；下放一批老工人出身的干部，回到原来的生产岗位上参加生产领导生产，更加深入地及时地发现问题，解决问题。到10月中旬为止，全公司已先后下放各级领导干部、工人出身的干部一千五百多人。
    这批领导干部下放之后，以在重要岗位或薄弱环节直接领导者的身份出现，与他们所在单位职工真正作到同呼吸共命运，更能深入实际深入群众发现问题；同时因为他们是上级领导成员，站得高看得远，能抓住关键问题，找出问题的症结，组织有关方面迅速解决，推动增产节约运动不断深入发展。第二炼钢厂副厂长钟鸣午，下放到乙班兼任党的工委书记之后，在一次跟班劳动中，发现十八号平炉职工害怕钢水缸准备不好，影响出钢，他们在出钢前半个多小时，就要求铸锭和运转工段给他们准备钢水缸，结果钢水缸来了，一等就是半小时，影响了其他平炉兑铁水和换渣缸。他从这件过去不引人注意的事情中，想到要保证增产，必须在全体职工中巩固地竖立起“先人后己”的整体观念。接着他再深入实际，又发现了十六号和十五号平炉在同时需要兑铁水时，十六号平炉职工主动地让十五号平炉先兑铁水的感人事例，他便在全班职工大会上表扬了十六号炉职工，并号召全班工人学习十六号炉职工把方便让给别人、把困难留给自己的高尚风格。这以后，影响兄弟平炉生产的现象大大减少了，并且做到为下一班生产创造好条件。10月上半月，他们在四班竞赛中被评为红旗班。
    这批下放的领导干部在同基层干部一块工作的过程中，他们深入细致的工作作风，发现关键问题一抓到底，组织广大职工攻克关键的领导方法，成为基层干部的学习榜样，帮助基层干部提高了工作水平。东鞍山铁矿党委副书记胡继尧，下放到烧结车间兼任党总支书记之后，他在研究如何进一步提高设备作业率的问题时，发现皮带运输机底下堆着厚厚一层灰尘，有的地方的灰尘把电动机的底座都给埋上了，运转速度受到影响。这个问题如果再不处理，很可能引起设备事故。他便马上发动工人鸣放讨论，紧跟着就组织工人进行清理，他并且亲自钻到皮带底下去，和工人一块苦战，几天就把灰尘清除干净了。胡继尧书记的这种作风和领导方法，教育了车间副主任沈维均。他领会到胡书记解决问题所以又快又彻底，关键在于抓住一个问题不放，并且亲自带头苦干。于是，他便和工人一块操作，同许多工人交换意见，很快就把九个月没解决的烧结机篦子问题解决了，使烧结机的生产效率提高了5％左右。
    老工人出身的干部重返前线，也有效地推动了生产的不断前进。炼铁厂老配管工人出身的设备车间副主任李国忠，下放到东工区当工长之后，发现九高炉热风瓣的冷却水压力不足，他便马上和工人一块修理好两台水泵，使水压从两公斤提高到三公斤，延长了热风瓣的寿命，为九高炉提高热风温度，节约焦炭多炼铁扫清了障碍。第三炼钢厂的护炉技师、快速炼钢能手李尚忠，下放到二十三号平炉当总炉长，他亲自炼过两炉钢之后发现这座平炉的炼钢时间长，关键在于出渣。渣口打得小，渣子放不出去。他在四班联席会上，把这个问题提了出来，大家都很同意。接着四班之间展开了打好出渣口的竞赛，使熔化时间从过去七个小时，缩短到五个小时左右。
    领导作风的进一步改进，生产关键的迅速攻克，鼓舞了鞍钢广大职工的冲天干劲。10月中旬的钢铁生产水平，比上旬又有显著提高，出现了一个旬旬上升持续跃进的大好局面。
    本报武汉31日电　湖北省松宜矿务局在夺取第四季度煤炭高产的增产节约运动中，采取下放干部、充实基层等措施，从根本上改善领导作风，大大地鼓舞了全局职工的革命干劲，促进了采煤、基本建设、运输等各项工作的全面跃进。这个局的煤炭生产从第三季度以来，一月高过一月，10月上、中旬掘进、生产和运输又都超过了9月份的水平。
    今年7月，松宜矿务局党委书记乔济民深入大河口煤矿，帮助这个矿进一步改进领导作风，并抓紧思想工作，解决了妨碍生产的关键问题。这种作法立即收到效果，全矿日产量迅速增长二倍，唐家洞煤矿学习大河口矿的经验后，产量也同样提高了二倍。这一事实使大家体会到，干部思想作风的改善，对于生产有巨大的促进作用。矿务局党委为了进一步推广大河口矿的经验，决定以占全局产量80％的松木坪矿为重点，实行“机关搬家”，毫不犹豫地把全局各级机构搬到松木坪矿；接着，又进一步下放干部，充实基层，使大批干部深入生产第一线，扎根落户，从而迅速出现了生产主动局面。
    松宜矿务局这一革命措施的具体作法是：把原来局的十三个科、室和矿的十一个股、室，分别合并为四个和三个办公室，从局、矿两级机关中下放50％的人员到坑、班、组。其中矿务局党委成员下放了50％。他们有的担任坑口的总支书记和坑长，有的担任汽车队长、农场场长等。全局十五个科级干部也下放了七个，到基层担任采区区长或生产班长、组长等职务；行政科长也下放当事务员，真正深入生产生活现场，同工人一起劳动，一起攻关键。这样，就把过去临时组织干部下去“攻关”，改变为干部下去安营扎寨；把下去“帮工”，“作客”，改变为干部下去具体负责并身体力行；把领导干部“观战”改变为直接“参战”指挥生产，从而大大促进了生产，密切了干部和群众的关系，一些长期没有解决的问题，也都迅速得到解决。例如枫香树坑501采区过去移一次电溜子要二十四小时，最快也要八小时，采煤工人出身的副矿长罗中密下放到这里当采区区长以后，同工人进行操作改革，创造了一种“快速移溜法”，两小时就解决问题，达到了全国先进水平。这个采区有个长一百一十米的工作面，煤层厚，顶板好，采用过长壁式采煤法，后来却没有坚持下来。自从局党委副书记徐长荣下放到这个坑担任总支书记兼坑长后，亲自下井同工人、技术人员研究，帮助群众解除思想顾虑，加强安全措施，重新采取了这个办法，日产量立即提高41.6％。光这个枫香树坑在十天之内就攻下大小关键三十八个。徐长荣深有体会地说：“一放到底好处多，证明党所教导的‘干部下去，工作上来’是一条真理。”工人们赞扬干部一放到底以后的五多五少是：深入的多，飘浮的少；实际工作的多，指手划脚的少；解决问题多，提出困难少；先进的多，落后的少；任务完成的多，欠产的少。
    干部下放、一放到底的结果，不仅充实了井下的生产力量，而且加强了坑、班、组的领导。这个局在下放的干部中，有八十人担任了班、组长职务，使班组普遍建立和健全了领导核心，大大地鼓舞了群众的生产积极性。在当前的增产节约运动中，他们开展了如火如荼的劳动竞赛，坑坑、班班、组组、人人之间都进行对口赛，促进了生产的全面高涨。今年一至九月份，原煤生产和煤炭运输分别比去年同期增长一倍和一倍以上，基本建设也有很大增长；进入10月份以后，各项指标更进一步上升，10月上、中旬原煤平均日产比9月同期增长7.3％，煤炭运输量增长49％，掘进日进尺也不断提高。同时由于实行好煤、坏煤分采分装，保证了煤炭的质量。
    在干部下放、充实基层的同时，松宜矿务局还采取了逐井排队，合理安排等办法，先后把地面上的辅助生产人员八百二十三人充实到井下生产，这些人除开掘了三个工作面以外，还新开了三对正规井和六对小煤窑。原来大河口煤矿提出增产一百吨煤，需要增加二百人，经过挖潜力，巧安排，不仅没有增加人，相反却抽出了一百人支援其他煤矿，日产水平比原来提高66％，实现了减人又增产。（附图片）
