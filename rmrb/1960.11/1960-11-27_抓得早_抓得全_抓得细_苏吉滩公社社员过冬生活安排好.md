Xinhua News Agency Report: The Party Committee of Sujitan Commune in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, adhering to the spirit of grasping production with one hand and life with the other, while vigorously strengthening canteen management, has made proper arrangements for the daily life of commune members in all aspects, including clothing and housing. Now that the severe winter has arrived on the grasslands, every commune member has four complete sets of cotton clothing (cotton coat, cotton trousers, cotton hat, and cotton shoes), enough to withstand the cold. In each settlement point of the commune, housing has been repaired, every household has a heated kang bed, and sufficient heating fuel has been prepared, ensuring that every commune member has a warm kang to sleep on, a fire to warm the room, and hot meals, dishes, and tea. In the mobile tents among the livestock herds, the herders have also added windbreaks around their tents and built earth kangs. At night, the tents are brightly lit and warm as spring. The broad masses of commune members unanimously praised the People's Commune for managing their affairs well, and they are more actively participating in various winter production tasks such as lambing, protecting livestock from freezing, and threshing grain into storage.

This year, Sujitan Commune's animal husbandry production has greatly developed, and for the first time, 7,000 mu of crops were planted, changing the past situation of relying on state grain supply. This has further encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. However, the development of agriculture and animal husbandry has also increased the workload of winter production, and the climatic conditions in pastoral areas are relatively poor. Based on this situation, the Commune Party Committee, as early as August, following the steps of prioritizing the distant before the near, livestock herds before settlements, herders before general commune members, made comprehensive arrangements for commune members' winter preparations in all aspects, from clothing, food, housing, transportation to medical care, with different priorities and urgencies. The commune and production teams established special institutions to manage daily life, with a secretary in charge of specific leadership. To solve the commune members' need for winter clothing, the commune's leather factory and clothing factory specially sewed leather coats, leather hats, and boots for the commune members, and purchased and transported a batch of cotton clothing and cotton from other places to sell to commune members who did not have winter clothing in a planned way. At the same time, each production team also organized temporary dismantling, washing, and mending groups composed of some older female commune members to help commune members dismantle, wash, and mend their original winter clothing. In order to help commune members solve the need for heating fuel, they also mobilized commune members to collect and dry a large amount of cow dung, organized labor and livestock to carry firewood by production team, and the commune also organized a coal mining team to mine a large amount of coal for each production team.

Vigorously strengthening canteen management is the focus of arranging the daily life of commune members during the winter. Before winter, each production team put forward the requirements of "hot meals and dishes, clean and hygienic," added or repaired canteens; installed stoves, improved stoves, and improved cooking efficiency; and according to the special needs of commune members, stipulated that they could either take the meal back to eat or take the grain back to cook it themselves. In order to enable herders in the field to eat hot meals and dishes, they also helped the herders set up mobile canteens that moved with the livestock herds. Depending on the distance of the livestock herds, these canteens could be shared by five or six people or by two or three people. Each production team also fixed some dairy cows to each canteen to ensure that commune members could often drink milk tea. The canteens have stocked a lot of frozen yogurt, butter, and meat, and dried and pickled a lot of dried vegetables and sauerkraut.

Comprehensiveness and meticulous management are a significant feature of Sujitan Commune's efforts to arrange the daily life of commune members during this winter. In the past, the commune members of this commune were nomads who lived by water and grass and lived in tents. The living conditions were very simple. For generations, they only used a piece of torn felt or leather to sleep on the ground, which could not guarantee warmth in winter, and many people suffered from arthritis as a result. This year, the Commune Party Committee, based on the already realized settlement, actively tried to improve the living conditions of commune members, and every household had a warm kang. Each production team also selected a group of people who could build kangs to form a technical team, and adopted the method of roving guidance to help commune members solve the difficulties of building warm kangs, such as technology and ingredients. Because the livestock herds of the Second Production Team were particularly scattered and far from the settlement, the Party Branch studied and formed a life and welfare team composed of accountants, doctors, store salespersons, barbers, and dismantling, washing, and mending personnel, to provide roving services to various livestock herds, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of herders. The commune also gave special care to commune members in five areas: the elderly, the young, the sick, pregnant women, and women in confinement.

At present, the grasslands have frequent snow, and the lowest temperature has dropped to more than minus 20 degrees Celsius. However, because the Commune Party Committee has done a good job in political and ideological work and life arrangements, the commune members have great enthusiasm for production. In terms of animal husbandry production, the herders, equipped with cold-proof equipment from head to toe, are full of energy and still insist on following the herds during the day and guarding the pens at night in the severe winter, ensuring that livestock are well-fed and watered. In order to delay the time of entering the winter pasture as much as possible, the broad masses of herders have adopted the method of setting up livestock pens in sheltered and sunny mountain depressions and building felt pieces for young animals at night. In order to welcome the busy season of lambing, many herders have launched a competition centered on the survival of lambs. In terms of agricultural production, the commune members have also launched a upsurge of rushing to transport bundles and attacking threshing. Taking the work group as a unit, they adopted the method of concentrating on specific areas to ensure that grain crops were transported and threshed before the mountains were blocked by heavy snow.

    抓得早  抓得全  抓得细
    苏吉滩公社社员过冬生活安排好
    据新华社讯　青海省门源回族自治县苏吉滩公社党委本着一手抓生产、一手抓生活的精神，在大抓食堂管理的同时，从社员的穿衣、住房等各个方面进行妥善安排。现在，严寒隆冬已来到了草原，每个社员都是四棉（棉衣、棉裤、棉帽、棉鞋）俱全，有了足以御寒的冬装。在公社的各个定居点上，住房已修补一新，家家盘上了暖炕，准备了充足的取暖燃料，保证了每个社员睡觉有热炕，房内有火烤，饭热菜香茶滚烫。在畜群间的各个流动帐房里，放牧员也在帐房四周加围了防风墙，盘上了地炕；晚上帐房里火光熊熊，温暖如春。广大社员一致称颂人民公社把家当的好，他们更加积极地参加接羔育幼、防冻保畜和粮食打碾入仓等各项冬季生产工作。
    今年，苏吉滩公社畜牧业生产有了很大发展，并且第一次扩种了七千亩庄稼，一举改变了过去一向依靠国家供应粮食的状况，更加鼓舞了广大社员的干劲。但是，农牧业生产发展也加重了冬季生产的工作量，牧区的气候条件又比较差，公社党委根据这一情况，早在8月间就本着先远后近，先畜群，后定居点，先放牧员，后一般社员的步骤，从衣、食、住、行到医疗卫生等各个方面，分别轻重缓急对社员的过冬准备作了全面安排。公社和生产队都成立了专门管理生活的机构，由一名书记负责具体领导。为了解决社员的冬衣需要，公社皮革厂、被服厂专门为社员缝制皮衣、皮帽和靴鞋，并且从外地采购调运了一批棉衣和棉花，有计划地出售给没有冬装的社员。与此同时，各生产队还由一部分年老的女社员组成临时性的拆洗缝补小组，帮助社员拆洗缝补了原有的冬装。为了帮助社员解决取暖燃料的需要，他们还发动社员大量拣晒牛粪，以生产队为单位组织劳畜力驮运烧柴，公社也组织了一个煤炭采挖队，为各生产队采挖了大量的烧煤。
    大抓食堂管理，是安排社员过冬生活中的重点。还在入冬以前，各生产队就提出“饭热菜热、干净卫生”的要求，增设或修补了食堂；安装暖炉、改良炉灶，提高炊事效率；并根据社员的特殊需要，规定既可以把饭打回去吃，也可以把粮食领回去自己做饭吃。为了使野外的放牧员能够吃到热饭热菜，还帮助放牧员成立了随畜群移动的流动食堂。这种食堂随畜群分布的远近，既可以由五六个人合一个灶，也可以由两三个人合一个灶。各生产队还把一部分奶牛固定到各个食堂，保证社员经常可以喝到奶茶。食堂都储备了许多冻酸奶、酥油和肉食，晒制和腌制了大量的干菜和酸菜。
    抓得全、管得细是苏吉滩公社今年狠抓社员过冬生活安排中的一个显著特点。这个公社的社员，过去都是逐水草而居，围帐幕而住的牧民，居住条件非常简陋；世世代代只是垫一块破毡片或皮张席地而卧，不能保证温暖过冬，许多人因此患上了关节炎。今年，公社党委在已实现定居的基础上，积极设法改善了社员的居住条件，家家户户都有暖炕。各生产队还抽出一部分会盘炕的人组成技术小组，采取巡回辅导的办法，帮助社员解决盘暖炕的技术和配料等困难。第二生产队由于畜群特别分散，离定居点又远，党支部就研究组成一个由会计、医生、商店售货员、理发员、拆洗缝补员等参加的生活福利小组，到各畜群巡回服务，受到广大放牧员的无比欢迎。公社还对老、幼、病、孕、产等五个方面的社员，给予了特别的照顾。
    目前，草原上冬雪频繁，最低温度已经降到了零下二十多度。但由于公社党委政治思想工作和生活抓得好，社员们的生产劲头很大。在畜牧业生产方面，从头到脚配齐了御寒装备的放牧员，精神抖擞，在风雪严寒的季节里仍坚持着白天跟群、夜晚守圈，保证牲畜吃饱喝好。广大放牧员为了尽量推迟进入冬季草场的时间，采取了把畜圈扎在避风向阳的山洼里和在夜晚给幼畜搭盖毡片的办法。为了迎接母羊产羔的大忙季节，许多放牧员又掀起了以比羊羔繁殖成活为中心的接羔育幼评比竞赛。在农业生产方面，社员们也掀起了抢运捆子、突击打碾的热潮。他们以作业组为单位，采取分片分块突击的办法，决心在大雪封山以前把粮食作物抢运打碾完毕。
