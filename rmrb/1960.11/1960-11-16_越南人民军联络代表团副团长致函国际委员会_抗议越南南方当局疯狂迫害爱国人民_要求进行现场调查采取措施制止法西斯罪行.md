Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 15th: Lieutenant Colonel Mai Lin, Deputy Head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam on November 8th, protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' atrocities in frenziedly persecuting patriotic people and former resistance personnel in Quang Nam Province, a former anti-French resistance base. He demanded that the International Commission in Vietnam conduct on-site investigations and take active measures to stop this fascist behavior of the South Vietnamese authorities.

The letter pointed out that in the six years since the restoration of peace, especially since the end of 1959, the South Vietnamese authorities have killed 2,000 patriots in Quang Nam Province, imprisoned more than 40,000 people, concentrated tens of thousands of people in "land reclamation areas," destroyed thousands of houses, and left tens of thousands of hectares of land barren. After listing the crimes of the South Vietnamese authorities over the years, the letter stated that at present, Quang Nam Province has prisons and concentration camps from the provincial level down to the village level, including sixteen county-level and provincial-level prisons. The prison in Tam Ky district alone currently holds 2,000 people, nine times more than in 1959.

The letter emphasized that recently, in order to closely monitor the people and facilitate their policy of persecution and retaliation, the South Vietnamese authorities forced the people to surround their villages, and set up armed forces and sentry posts to monitor the actions of the villagers. Thousands of acres of unharvested rice paddies and gardens were flattened to build so-called "model villages," "agrovilles," "land reclamation areas," and strategic highways. Hundreds of thousands of patriotic people were drafted as forced labor.

The letter finally requested the International Commission in Vietnam to take active measures, conduct on-site investigations, and force the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately stop their fascist persecution and retaliation in Quang Nam Province and other provinces of Vietnam; to immediately disband all "agrovilles," concentration camps, and prisons in Quang Nam Province, and revoke the village encirclement orders; and to immediately restore the democratic and free rights of former resistance personnel and patriotic people illegally detained and controlled in Quang Nam Province and other provinces.

    越南人民军联络代表团副团长致函国际委员会
    抗议越南南方当局疯狂迫害爱国人民
    要求进行现场调查采取措施制止法西斯罪行
    新华社河内15日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团副团长梅林中校11月8日写信给越南国际委员会，抗议越南南方当局在前抗战根据地广南省疯狂迫害爱国人民和前抗战人员的暴行，并要求越南国际委员会进行现场调查、采取积极措施制止越南南方当局的这种法西斯行为。
    信中指出，和平恢复六年来，特别是1959年底以来，越南南方当局在广南省杀害了二千名爱国者，四万多人被关进监牢，成万人被集中到“垦荒区”，成千间民房被毁坏，成万公顷田地被荒废。信中在列举了越南南方当局几年来的罪行之后说，目前，广南省自省到村都设有监牢和集中营，其中县级和省级的监牢就有十六个。仅三歧县的监牢目前就关着二千人，比1959年增加了九倍。
    信中强调指出，最近，为了严密地监视人民和便于他们实行迫害报复政策，越南南方当局强迫人民把村庄围起来，并设有武装力量和哨岗以监视乡民的行动。成千亩未收割的稻田和园地被坦平以用来建立所谓“模范乡”、“稠密区”、“垦荒区”和战略公路。数以十万计的爱国人民被拉伕。
    信中最后要求越南国际委员会采取积极措施，进行现场调查，迫使越南南方当局立即停止在广南省和越南其他省份的法西斯的迫害、报复行为；立即解散广南省所有的“稠密区”、集中营、监牢，撤销围村令；并立即恢复广南省和其他省份被非法拘禁和管制的前抗战人员和爱国人民的民主和自由权利。
