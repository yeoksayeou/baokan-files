Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: Washington – While the U.S. government conducts military provocations in the Caribbean Sea, preparing for an armed attack on Cuba, it is also actively instigating the Organization of American States to rubber-stamp its planned aggression.

A dispatch from Washington by United Press International on the 19th leaked this intention of the American invasion clique. This news agency quoted the opinions of local “diplomatic figures” who believe that a meeting of American foreign ministers will be held to discuss Guatemala’s accusation of Cuba’s so-called "participation in recent subversive activities in Central America" (referring to the struggle of the people of Guatemala and Nicaragua against the U.S. puppet regimes). The excuse put forward by the U.S. for amassing troops in the Caribbean is to "protect" the aforementioned two countries from so-called foreign "interference." The UPI dispatch, quoting these "diplomatic figures," revealed that the U.S. will instigate one or several of its client states to come forward and suggest that a foreign ministers' "consultation meeting" be held in accordance with the Organization of American States charter to "take measures against the situation in Cuba."

According to an Associated Press report, U.S. President-elect Kennedy yesterday again explored various issues related to so-called "security" in the Caribbean region.

Meanwhile, according to reports from Guatemala City, Guatemalan President Ydígoras openly created excuses for the U.S. to launch an invasion of Cuba in a speech to the military yesterday, fabricating the claim that "Communists directed by Castro have gained a foothold on our (Guatemalan) territory."

    美国加紧利用美洲国家组织干涉古巴
    合众国际社透露美国正策划召开美洲外长会议
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府在加勒比海上进行了军事挑衅准备对古巴发动武装进攻的同时，又积极策动美洲国家组织来为它发动侵略行动盖橡皮图章。
    合众国际社19日从华盛顿发出的一条消息泄露了美国侵略集团的这一意图。这家通讯社引当地“外交界人士”的意见认为，将举行一次美洲外长会议来讨论危地马拉指责所谓古巴“参与最近中美洲的颠覆活动的问题”（即指危地马拉和尼加拉瓜两国人民反抗美国傀儡政权的斗争），而美国为它陈兵加勒比海所提出的借口，就是要“保护”上述两个国家以防止所谓外来的“干涉”。合众国际社的消息引这些“外交人士”的话透露，美国将策动它的一个或几个仆从国家出面，建议按照美洲国家组织章程举行一次外长“协商会议”来“对古巴的局势采取措施”。
    据美联社报道，美国当选总统肯尼迪昨天再度探讨了有关加勒比海地区所谓“安全”的各项问题。
    同时，据来自危地马拉城的消息报道，危地马拉总统伊迪戈拉斯昨天在向军队发表的一篇演说中，也公然为美国发动侵略古巴的行动制造借口，他捏造所谓“受到卡斯特罗指使的共产党人在我们（危地马拉）的领土上插上了足”。
