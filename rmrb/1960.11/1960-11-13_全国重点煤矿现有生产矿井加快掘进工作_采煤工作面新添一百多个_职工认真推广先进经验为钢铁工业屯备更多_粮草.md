Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch: Recently, over one hundred new coal mining faces have been added to the existing production mines of sixty-one key coal mines nationwide. Assuming each working face produces 7,000 tons of raw coal per month, this is equivalent to adding ten pairs of mines with an annual output of 600,000 tons. This is the result of various coal mining enterprises conscientiously implementing the principle of "grasping production with one hand and preparation with the other," and strengthening tunneling work in the great competition to "store grain and prepare grass" for the steel industry.

Opening up and tunneling is the preliminary step for coal mines to excavate roadways and prepare working faces for coal mining. Since the beginning of this year, in order to increase coal production to support the steel industry, coal mining progress at working faces has generally accelerated in various coal mining enterprises; whether tunneling work can keep up has become a crucial key to organizing high coal production. To this end, many mining bureaus have established tunneling leading groups at all levels, headed by the Party Committee Secretary, and have extracted major administrative leaders and engineering technicians to focus on tunneling work, and delegated a large number of cadres to enrich the grassroots leadership of tunneling. All tunneling districts have also adopted methods such as assigning personnel, tasks, equipment, areas, and time, arranging tunneling plans on a monthly and ten-day basis, and inspecting the implementation of plans on a daily and shift basis, thereby greatly accelerating the progress of tunneling. According to statistics from thirty coal mines, including Huainan, Zaozhuang, and Hebi, the average daily footage of tunneling in September increased by 5.09% compared to August; and increased by another 3.6% in October compared to September.

Workers in various mines conscientiously study and promote advanced experiences in tunneling, and carry out various forms of competition activities, which have also rapidly improved the level of tunneling work. Since the Hebi Coal Mine launched the competition movement to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and surpass tunneling pacesetter Qi Hezhi, the progress of thirteen tunneling teams in tunneling coal roadways has increased from the original one or two hundred meters per month to eight hundred to one thousand meters, and another five rapid tunneling teams have broken the record of more than two thousand meters per month for three consecutive months. Due to the accelerated tunneling speed, the current coal mining face of this mine has increased by 12% compared to August, and the coal volume obtained has increased by 43%. In the movement to learn from tunneling pacesetters Ren Guangjin and Li Changliang in the Kailuan Coal Mine, hundreds of pacesetters were organized to promote advanced experiences such as multi-drill drilling and deep-hole blasting in various tunneling areas, which also enabled many previously backward and inefficient tunneling teams to quickly catch up with the advanced level. In the competition, the Da Tai Mine in western Beijing fully utilized the form of production sports meets to integrate various advanced technical and management experiences of tunneling work and widely promote them in all tunneling teams.

The tunneling teams in various coal mines have also expanded compared to the past. Many mines have adjusted labor organizations and transferred a large number of outstanding workers from auxiliary departments and surplus personnel after technological innovations to enrich the front line of tunneling. Some cadres who were old tunneling workers who had been off the job for a long time have recently returned to their original positions.

At present, in order to further improve the efficiency and quality of tunneling work, and to ensure that all mines have sufficient coal production and reserve working faces for the final forty days of this year and the first quarter of next year, they are continuing to strengthen various technical management work related to tunneling. Coal mines such as Huainan, Zibo, Xuzhou, and Fushun have established strong rapid tunneling teams, and have taken a series of measures to frequently balance and adjust the proportional relationship between mining and tunneling, ensuring that there are sufficient reserve working faces for normal succession under the condition of continuous increase in coal production.

    全国重点煤矿现有生产矿井加快掘进工作
    采煤工作面新添一百多个
    职工认真推广先进经验为钢铁工业屯备更多“粮草”
    据新华社12日讯　最近全国六十一个重点煤矿的现有生产矿井，又新添一百多个采煤工作面；按每个工作面月产七千吨原煤计算，等于新增加十对年产六十万吨的矿井。这是各地煤矿企业在为钢铁工业
  “屯粮备草”的大竞赛中，认真贯彻一手抓生产，一手抓准备，加强掘进工作的结果。
    开拓掘进，是煤矿为采煤开凿巷道和准备工作面的先行步骤。今年以来，各地煤矿企业为了增产更多的煤炭支援钢铁工业，工作面的采煤进度普遍加快；而掘进工作能否跟上，就成为组织煤炭高产的重要关键。为此，许多矿务局都在加强采煤的同时，层层建立了以党委书记为首的掘进领导小组，抽出主要行政领导干部和工程技术人员专抓掘进工作，并下放大批干部充实掘进的基层领导力量。各掘进区也都采用定人员、定任务、定设备、定地区、定时间等办法，按月按旬安排掘进计划，按日按班检查计划执行情况，因而大大加快了掘进的进度。根据淮南、枣庄、鹤壁等三十个煤矿统计，9月份平均掘进日进尺比8月份提高5.09％；10月份又比9月份提高3.6％。
    各矿职工认真学习和推广掘进的先进经验，开展多种多样的竞赛活动，也迅速提高了掘进工作的水平。鹤壁煤矿自开展学、比、赶、超掘进标兵齐合只的竞赛运动以来，已有十三个掘进队掘进煤巷的进度，从原来月进一、二百米提高到八百到一千米，另有五个快速掘进队连续三个月突破了月进两千米的纪录。由于掘进速度加快，目前这个矿采煤工作面已比8月份增加了12％，获得煤量增加43％。开滦煤矿在开展学习任广金、李长亮掘进标兵的运动中，组织了几百名标兵到各掘进区推广多台电钻打眼、深孔爆破等先进经验，也使许多原来后进的工效掘进队迅速赶上了先进水平。京西大台矿在竞赛中充分运用生产运动会的形式，把掘进工作的各项先进技术经验和管理经验配套成龙，并在所有掘进小组中普遍推广。
    各地煤矿的掘进队伍也比过去扩大了。许多矿通过调整劳动组织，从辅助部门和技术革新后多余的人员中，抽调大批优秀工人充实了掘进第一线。一些脱产已久的老掘进工人出身的干部，最近已纷纷重返原来的工作岗位。
    目前，各矿为了进一步提高掘进工作的效率和质量，保证各矿井在大干今年最后四十多天和明年第一季度生产中能有充足的获得煤量和备用工作面，还正在继续加强有关掘进的各项技术管理工作。淮南、淄博、徐州、抚顺等煤矿都建立了强有力的快速掘进的队伍，并且采取一系列的措施，经常平衡和调整采掘之间的比例关系，保证在煤产量不断增加的情况下，有足够的备用工作面正常接续。（附图片）
