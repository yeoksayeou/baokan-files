Large Numbers of Excellent Cadres from Liangyang and Dali Counties Transferred to the Grassroots Level
    Helping Small Team Cadres Improve Their Policy Understanding
    Effectively Strengthening Grassroots Leadership, and Turning Many Backward Teams into Advanced Teams
    (Reported by our newspaper) A large number of excellent cadres from Liangyang County, Guangdong Province, have been transferred to settle down in production teams, effectively replenishing the ranks of grassroots leaders. This has led to varying degrees of improvement in the work of more than 6,500 production teams across the county, with many backward teams already becoming advanced teams.
    In accordance with the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the Liangyang County Party Committee decided to transfer a large number of cadres to strengthen the leadership of production teams, implementing a system of four levels of cadres working together to strengthen production teams. The specific methods are as follows: First, cadres who had been transferred from various teams in the past two years should be resolutely returned to their original teams if possible. Second, streamline the brigade-level organizations to strengthen the leadership of the small teams. Third, transfer cadres from county-level organs and communes to production teams. Fourth, stipulate that all cadres going to the countryside should carry out their work with the production team as their base. Fifth, concentrate superior forces to focus on backward areas. To date, county-level organs have transferred 974 cadres, accounting for more than 50% of the total; communes have transferred 974 cadres, accounting for 65%; and according to incomplete statistics, more than 2,600 cadres from brigades have been transferred to small teams. The majority of these transferred cadres have been assigned to backward production teams, serving as team leaders, deputy team leaders, work group leaders, and canteen directors, effectively strengthening the leadership of the small teams.
    After a large number of cadres were sent to the teams, how to run a production team well? The Liangyang County Party Committee promptly summarized the experiences of advanced areas and put forward four basic requirements: First, comprehensively examine the implementation of policies; Second, focus on improving living conditions to promote production, and run collective welfare undertakings centered on the canteen; Third, improve the leadership level of small team cadres, cultivate poor and lower-middle peasant activists, and strengthen the leadership core; Fourth, strengthen political and ideological work, and cadres must set an example.
    Cadres at all levels who have been transferred have promoted a spirit of hard work and thoroughness, adhered to the "four togethers," and conscientiously publicized and implemented various policies to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. Many cadres transferred from county-level organs put forward the slogan of "four arrives, four no returns," namely: Arrive at the forefront of field production and not return until a good harvest is secured; Arrive in the most difficult places and not return until the problems are solved; Arrive in poor teams and not return until the situation is changed; Arrive in backward teams and not return until the cadres have improved and production has been boosted. Wu Zhankui, a cadre from a county-level organ, discovered that the canteen of the Shipanzi small team of the Heshui Commune lacked edible oil and vegetables after being transferred there. He worked with the masses to build an oil press using local methods and vigorously engaged in rice bran oil extraction, initially solving the problem of edible oil for the commune members; he also took the lead in leveling land and planting vegetables. After more than a month of effort, he has enabled the commune members to eat sufficient vegetables every day.
    In strengthening the work of production teams, cadres at all levels have regarded the cultivation and improvement of the original small team cadres as a key task, specifically helping them to grasp policies, improve their leadership level, and improve their work style according to their different situations. The Feng Chao Biao small team of the Shuangfeng Brigade in the Hailing Commune had long been unable to improve its work due to the poor working ability of the team leader, Feng Shangxiong, who was unfamiliar with policies and did not understand management. The cadres transferred here earnestly helped them study policies, learn management, and also helped a work-point recorder learn how to record work points according to quotas, thereby promptly clearing up the work-point accounts and labor grain accounts, solving problems that the commune members had been demanding for a long time, improving their enthusiasm for production, and beginning to change the backward situation. With the help of a large number of cadres who were transferred, 46 backward teams in the Tan Shui Commune have now become advanced teams.

    (Reported by our newspaper from Xi'an on the 23rd) As this year's "Three Autumns" production began, Dali County, Shaanxi Province, transferred more than 1,800 excellent cadres from the county and commune-level leading departments to work in production teams, including 1,297 who concurrently served as deputy secretaries of party branches or deputy team leaders, effectively strengthening the grassroots leadership.
    Cadres who concurrently serve as deputy positions in the small teams mainly help the small team cadres to study and understand the party's principles and policies, so that the policies can be implemented to the masses in a timely and accurate manner. In late October, the Dajia Ying small team of the Xuzhuang People's Commune faced difficulties in completing the wheat sowing on time due to the expansion of the wheat planting area. The small team leader, Jing Yiming, requested support from the nearby Da Hao Ying small team, which had more labor. Lu Simu, the stationed cadre and deputy director of the commune, participated in the team committee meeting to discuss this issue. He pointed out how to adhere to the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange" in the cooperation, and that it is essential to consult with Da Hao Ying to ensure both sides are willing. After doing so, the cadres and commune members of the Da Hao Ying small team were very satisfied, and the quality of the wheat sown through cooperation was very good.
    Some small team cadres often do not know how to unify the tasks with the Party's policies when production tasks are urgent. For example, the Dong Da Hao production team had heavy "Three Autumns" tasks this year. The small team leader, Wang Xide, calculated the labor and animal power and felt that it would be impossible to complete the tasks without mobilizing the commune members to work overtime. The stationed cadre explained the "balance between work and rest" policy to him and guided him to hand over the tasks to the masses for discussion. As a result, the commune members put forward a large number of reasonable suggestions for organizing labor, cross-operation, and drawing non-production personnel and animal power to strengthen the front line, and the problem was successfully resolved.
    Many small team cadres are not good at summarizing experiences, and therefore cannot improve their ideological understanding more quickly. Stationed cadres generally hold a team committee or branch committee meeting every time a task or a stage of work is completed to help the small team cadres conduct inspections and summarize experiences and lessons based on policies, which greatly helps to improve the policy and ideological level of the small team cadres.
    Dali County's practice of transferring a large number of cadres to help small team cadres improve their policy understanding has achieved significant results. The Party's policies have been implemented more comprehensively and thoroughly this year than in the past. Although the area of autumn fields and autumn sowing has been greatly expanded this year, the "Three Autumns" work has been completed better and faster than before. All 840,000 mu of wheat fields sown this year have been deeply ploughed before sowing, and more than 90% have been adequately fertilized. Because the sowing was timely and the quality was good, the seedlings are now complete and strong. Detailed arrangements have also been made for the commune members' winter living conditions.
    At present, the Dali County Party Committee is concentrating this group of cadres who have been sent down to the small teams for a short-term rectification training, summarizing experiences so that they can help the small team cadres to further deepen the implementation of the Party's policies when they go down again.

### 两阳和大荔两县大批优秀干部下放基层  帮助小队干部提高政策水平  有效地加强了基层领导工作，使不少落后队变为先进队

    两阳和大荔两县大批优秀干部下放基层
    帮助小队干部提高政策水平
    有效地加强了基层领导工作，使不少落后队变为先进队
    本报讯　广东两阳县下放大批优秀干部到生产小队安家落户，有效地充实了基层领导骨干，使全县六千五百多个生产小队的工作水平有了不同程度的提高，有不少落后队已经跃为先进队。
    根据大办农业、大办粮食的方针，中共两阳县委决定下放大批干部加强生产小队的领导，实行四级干部一齐动手加强生产小队。具体办法是：一、把最近两年来从各小队抽调出来的干部，凡是可以调回去的都坚决调回原队。二、精简大队机构，充实小队领导力量。三、从县属机关和公社抽调干部下放生产小队。四、规定所有下乡干部，以生产小队为阵地开展工作。五、以优势力量抓落后地区。到目前为止，县级机关已先后下放干部九百七十四人，占总数50％以上；各公社下放了九百七十四人，占65％；各大队下放小队的干部，据不完全统计有二千六百多人。这些下放干部绝大部分都下放到落后的生产小队，担任了正副队长、作业组长、食堂主任等职务，有效地加强了小队的领导力量。
    大批干部下到小队以后，如何把一个生产小队办好？两阳县委及时总结了先进地区的经验，提出了四项基本要求：一、全面检查政策执行情况；二、抓生活促生产，办好以食堂为中心的集体生活福利事业；三、提高小队干部领导水平，培养贫农、下中农积极分子，健全领导核心；四、抓好政治思想工作，干部要以身作则。
    各级下放干部发扬了艰苦深入的作风，坚持“四同”，认真宣传和贯彻各项政策，调动群众积极性。许多县机关下放干部提出了“四到、四不回”的口号，即：到田间生产第一线去，丰收不到手不回来；到最困难的地方去，问题不解决不回来；到穷队去，面貌不改变不回来；到后进队去，干部不提高、生产不搞好不回来。县属机关干部吴占奎，下到合水公社石盘仔小队以后，发现这个小队的食堂食油和蔬菜不足，便和群众一起，采用土办法制造榨油槽，大搞米糠榨油，初步解决了社员食油问题；他还带头整地种菜，经过一个多月的努力，已使社员每天吃上足够的菜。
    在加强生产小队的工作中，各级干部都把培养和提高原有小队干部作为一个关键来抓，根据他们的不同情况，具体帮助他们掌握政策，提高领导水平，改进工作作风。海陵公社双丰大队冯朝表小队，过去由于队长冯尚雄工作能力差，不熟悉政策，不懂得经营管理，结果工作长期搞不好。下放到这里的干部便认真帮助他们学习政策，学会经营管理，还帮助一个记分员学会按定额记工分，从而及时清理了工分账和劳动粮账，使社员们长久以来要求解决的问题得到解决，生产积极性提高了，落后现象开始改变。潭水公社在大批下放干部的帮助下，现在全社已有四十六个落后小队变成先进队。
    本报西安23日电　今年“三秋”生产开始，陕西大荔县从县、公社各级领导部门下放一千八百多名优秀干部到生产小队工作，其中有一千二百九十七人兼任党支部副书记或小队副队长，有效地加强了基层领导工作。
    到小队兼任副职的干部主要是帮助小队干部学习领会党的方针政策，以便把政策及时准确地贯彻到群众中去。10月下旬，许庄人民公社党家营小队由于小麦播种面积扩大，依靠本小队劳力要按时种完小麦有困难，小队长井一明要求附近劳力较多的大好营小队支援他们，驻队干部、公社副社长吕思慕参加小队队委会共同讨论了这个问题，他指出了在协作中如何坚持“自愿两利、等价交换”的原则，一定要和大好营共同商量，作到两头情愿。这样作以后，大好营小队干部和社员都非常满意，协作播种的麦子质量很好。
    有些小队干部在生产任务紧急的时候，往往不知道把任务与党的政策统一起来。如东大壕生产小队，今年“三秋”工作繁重，小队长王喜德算了算劳畜力账，认为不动员社员加班加点，就没法完成任务。驻队干部给他讲解了“劳逸结合”政策，同时指点他把任务交给了群众讨论，结果社员们提出了大量合理组织劳力、交叉作业和抽调非生产人员、畜力增强第一线的建议，问题顺利地解决了。
    许多小队干部由于不善于总结经验，因而不能更快地提高思想认识。驻队干部一般每当一段工作、一段活路完成后，就开一次队委会或支委会，帮助小队干部根据政策进行检查，总结经验教训，对提高小队干部的政策思想水平有很大帮助。
    大荔县下放大批干部帮助小队干部提高政策水平的作法已经取得显著效果。党的政策今年比以往贯彻的更全面、更彻底了，虽然今年的秋田和秋播面积扩大的很多，但三秋工作比以前完成的更好、更快。今年下种的八十四万亩麦田播种前全部经过深翻，90％以上都施足了底肥，由于种的适时，质量又好，现在出苗齐全茁壮。在社员过冬生活方面也普遍地进行了细致安排。
    目前，中共大荔县委又把这批下放小队的干部短期集中整训，总结经验，以便他们再次下去后，帮助小队干部在贯彻党的政策上更深入一步。外村来帮助秋耕了陈忠志作
