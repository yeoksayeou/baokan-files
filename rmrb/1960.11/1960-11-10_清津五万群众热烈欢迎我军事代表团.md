Xinhua News Agency, Qingjin, 9th: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, led by Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing, and accompanied by Vice Premier of the Korean Cabinet Zheng Junze and Vice Minister of National Defense, General Choi Yongjin, arrived in Qingjin from Hamhung this morning.

Approximately 50,000 people and Korean People's Army officers and soldiers warmly welcomed the Chinese guests at Qingjin Station, waving Korean and Chinese national flags and bouquets, and chanting "Long Live Marshal Kim Il-sung" and "Long Live Chairman Mao Zedong." The Korean and Chinese national flags fluttered on the roof of the station building, and long banners reading "Long Live the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung" and "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong" stretched from the building to the ground. The corridors and windows of the four-story buildings on both sides of the station were also crowded with welcoming crowds.

Korean People's Army Air Force Commander General Choi Kwang, Chairman of the Hamgyongbuk-do People's Committee Kim Se-bong, Vice Chairman of the Korean Workers' Party Hamgyongbuk-do Committee Zhu Jishu, Vice Chairman of the Do People's Committee Lim Ryong-ho, Chairman of the Qingjin City Party Committee Zhang Jijun, Vice Chairmen Choi Jae-jin and Kim Jin-sik, and other comrades, all went to the station to welcome the delegation.

When the delegation ascended the rostrum temporarily set up in the station square, the welcoming masses erupted in stormy cheers. Although snowflakes filled the sky, the deep friendship between the Korean and Chinese people made people feel warm and unaware of the cold.

At the welcoming rally, Comrade Kim Se-bong spoke first. On behalf of all the people of Hamgyongbuk-do, he extended the most sincere and warm welcome to the distinguished Chinese guests.

When Kim Se-bong spoke of the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people, he pointed out that the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China, separated by a river, has a long history. It was forged and consolidated with blood in the long and arduous struggle against foreign aggressors. This visit to Korea by the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade He Long is another clear manifestation of the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people and armies of Korea and China.

When Kim Se-bong spoke of the construction achievements made by the Korean people after the war, he said that under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people, responding to the party's call and following the general line of post-war recovery and construction, launched the Chollima Movement, which rapidly changed our country's historically backward economic state and eliminated the traces of war damage. Our country has today been built into a socialist industrial-agricultural country with a solid foundation for an independent national economy. Kim Se-bong warmly praised the brilliant victories achieved by the fraternal Chinese people in socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. He said that the Chinese people, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have achieved continuous Great Leaps Forward. This year, there has been a new leap forward in socialist construction, rapidly transforming the formerly backward China into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced culture and science.

Kim Se-bong condemned the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people—the American imperialist aggressors—for continuing to forcibly occupy China's territory of Taiwan and continuing to carry out provocative activities against the Chinese people. He said that any clamor of American imperialism will inevitably meet with final failure in the face of the might of the Korean and Chinese people, who are closely united under the banner of proletarian internationalism. The American imperialists must get out of South Korea, and the unification of our motherland will definitely be realized. The struggle of the Chinese people, united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will surely liberate Taiwan.

Marshal He Long then spoke. He first expressed his deep gratitude to the people and People's Army troops of Qingjin City, a famous industrial city in Korea, for their warm welcome to the delegation, and extended his cordial greetings to them.

He Long warmly praised the heroic Korean people for the brilliant victories they have achieved in post-war recovery work and the development of socialist construction under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung. He said that in the Chollima Movement, you have displayed a heroic revolutionary spirit and great work enthusiasm, promoted the communist style of daring to think and act, innovating and creating, supporting each other, and cooperating with each other, so that the entire industry, agriculture, transportation, and scientific and cultural undertakings have been greatly developed. Qingjin City is a famous ferrous metallurgical industrial base in Korea, undertaking the glorious task of supporting national construction. In the post-war period, thanks to the correct leadership of the Korean Workers’ Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung and the selfless efforts of the working class and all the people of Qingjin City, it has rapidly developed into one of the largest industrial bases in Korea. Every achievement you and the entire Korean people have made in socialist construction not only strengthens the power of your own motherland, but also strengthens the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and is a powerful support for defending your motherland, realizing the unification of the entire Korea, and maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. I congratulate you on achieving even more and greater achievements in future construction.

Marshal He Long finally said that the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is unbreakable. In the common struggle against imperialist aggression, whether on Chinese soil or on Korean soil, the heroic sons and daughters of our two countries, for the common interests of our two peoples and for the overall interests of the working people of the world, fought shoulder to shoulder and shed blood together. Now, our two peoples are supporting, learning from, and encouraging each other in the common cause of building socialism. This fighting friendship and unity forged with blood is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It will surely be as deep and wide as the Pacific Ocean and as strong as Mount Paektu.

Qiao Xiaoguang, Chinese Ambassador to Korea, and Senior Colonel Zhang Leting, Military Attaché, also arrived in Qingjin with the delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, led by Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing, visited two units of the Korean People's Army led by Zheng Linzhe and Han Taizhu respectively yesterday and today.

Accompanied by Vice Premier of the Korean Cabinet Zheng Junze and Vice Minister of National Defense, General Choi Yongjin, the delegation was warmly welcomed by the People's Army officers and soldiers during its visit to these two units. During the visit, the guests and hosts held cordial talks.

After the visit, Marshal He Long personally presented pennants and other gifts to these two units.

    清津五万群众热烈欢迎我军事代表团
    金世凤说朝中人民共同敌人美帝国主义的任何叫嚣必定在两国人民的威力面前遭到失败
    贺龙说建立在马克思列宁主义基础上的中朝人民鲜血凝结成的友谊将像长白山一样坚强
    新华社清津9日电　由贺龙元帅和罗瑞卿大将率领的中国访朝军事友好代表团，由朝鲜内阁副首相郑准泽、民族保卫省副相崔勇进上将陪同，今天上午由咸兴到达清津。
    在清津车站上约有五万群众和朝鲜人民军官兵热烈欢迎中国客人，他们高举着朝中两国国旗和花束，欢呼“金日成元帅万岁”、“毛泽东主席万岁”。车站大楼顶上飘扬着朝中两国国旗，“以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府万岁”、“以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国万岁”的长幅标语，从大楼上一直伸展到地面。车站两侧的四层大楼的廊道和窗口上也挤满了欢迎的群众。
    朝鲜人民军空军司令崔光上将，咸镜北道人民委员会委员长金世凤，朝鲜劳动党咸镜北道委员会副委员长朱济洙，道人民委员会副委员长林龙浩，清津市党委员会委员长张吉俊、副委员长崔再镇、金镇植等同志，都到车站欢迎代表团。
    当代表团登上在车站广场临时搭起的主席台时，欢迎群众发出暴风雨般的欢呼声。虽然天空雪片纷飞，但是朝中两国人民的深厚情谊使人们浑身流动着暖流，感觉不到寒冷。
    在欢迎大会上，金世凤同志首先讲话。他代表咸镜北道全体人民向中国贵宾表示最衷心、最热烈的欢迎。
    金世凤在谈到朝中两国人民的友谊时指出，一江之隔的朝中两国人民的友谊团结有着悠久的历史，它是在长期的反对外来侵略者的艰苦的斗争过程中，以鲜血凝结和巩固起来的。这次以贺龙同志为团长的中华人民共和国军事友好代表团对朝鲜的访问，是朝中两国人民和军队间的牢不可破的友谊团结的又一个明显表现。
    金世凤在谈到朝鲜人民战后所取得的建设成就时说，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的英明领导下，响应党的号召，遵循战后恢复建设的总路线，展开了千里马运动，使我国迅速地改变了从历史上遗留下来的经济落后状态，消除了战争破坏的痕迹。我国今天已经建成为一个有着独立民族经济的巩固基础的社会主义工业—农业国家。金世凤热烈赞扬兄弟般的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，在社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌的胜利。他说，中国人民高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，实现连续的大跃进，今年在社会主义建设中又有了新的跃进，使过去落后的中国正在迅速地改变成为具有现代工业、现代农业和先进文化科学的社会主义大强国。
    金世凤谴责朝中两国人民共同的敌人——美帝国主义侵略者继续强占中国的领土台湾，继续进行反对中国人民的挑衅活动。他说，美帝国主义的任何叫嚣，必定在紧紧地团结在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下的朝中两国人民的威力面前最后遭到失败。美帝国主义者必须从南朝鲜滚出去，我们祖国的统一一定能够实现。在中国共产党领导下团结起来的中国人民的斗争必将解放台湾。
    贺龙元帅接着讲了话。他首先对朝鲜的著名工业城市清津市的人民和人民军部队对代表团的热烈欢迎表示深切的感谢，并向他们表示亲切的问候。
    贺龙热烈赞扬英雄的朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，在战后恢复工作和发展社会主义建设方面所取得的光辉的胜利。他说，你们在跨上千里马的运动中，发挥了英勇的革命精神和巨大的工作干劲，发扬了敢想敢干、革新创造、互相支援、互相协作的共产主义风格，使整个工业、农业、交通运输和科学文化事业都得到长足的发展。清津市是朝鲜著名的黑色冶金工业基地，担负着支援全国建设的光荣任务。在战后时期，由于以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的正确领导以及清津市工人阶级和全体人民的忘我努力，这里已经迅速地发展成为朝鲜最大的工业基地之一。你们和全体朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中所取得的每一成就，不但加强了自己祖国的力量，而且也加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量，对于保卫你们的祖国，实现整个朝鲜的统一，以及对于维护远东及世界和平都是有力的支持。我祝贺你们在今后的建设中取得更多更大的成就。
    贺龙元帅最后说，中朝两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的。在反对帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中，无论在中国的土地上、或者在朝鲜的土地上，我们两国的英雄儿女，为了我们两国人民的共同利益，为了世界劳动人民的整体利益肩并肩地共同作战，把鲜血流在一起。现在我们两国人民又在建设社会主义的共同事业中互相支援、互相学习、互相鼓舞。我们这种用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊和团结，是建筑在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的。它必将像太平洋一样深广，像长白山一样坚强。
    中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光和武官张乐亭上校也和代表团一起到了清津。
    新华社平壤9日电　由贺龙元帅、罗瑞卿大将率领的中国访朝军事友好代表团在昨天和今天先后访问了分别由郑林哲和韩泰洙领导的朝鲜人民军的两支部队。
    代表团在朝鲜内阁副首相郑准泽、民族保卫省副相崔勇进上将陪同下，在这两个部队参观访问时，受到了人民军官兵的热烈欢迎。访问期间，宾主进行了亲切的交谈。
    参观访问后，贺龙元帅亲手向这两支部队赠送了锦旗等礼品。
