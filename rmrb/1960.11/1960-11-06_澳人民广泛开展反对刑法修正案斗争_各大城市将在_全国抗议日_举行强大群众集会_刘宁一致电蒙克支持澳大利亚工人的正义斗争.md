Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch from Sydney: The Australian Council of Trade Unions is organizing large-scale labor movement mass meetings in major cities across Australia for the "National Day of Protest" on November 6th to protest the Menzies government's fascist criminal law amendment.

Currently, participants in the struggle against the criminal law amendment include almost all trade unions in Australia, as well as peace, women's, and youth organizations. Fourteen thousand workers in the steel industry region of Wollongong-Port Kembla on the South Coast of New South Wales went on strike to oppose this fascist criminal law amendment and sent a protest delegation of four hundred people to Canberra (where Parliament is currently discussing the criminal law amendment).

Next week, the coal and steel industrial region of Newcastle will also send a large delegation. Delegations from Sydney are now going to Canberra every day to present their opinions to politicians.

The workers have risen up and have not hesitated to express their attitude towards the amendment. They demand that strong measures be taken to prevent the amendment from becoming law.

Participation in this nationwide struggle against the criminal law amendment is not limited to trade unions, youth, and women's organizations. Churches, legal professionals, and some well-known Australian writers, including Mrs. Gilmore, Prichard Mann, etc., have also joined the struggle.

The "Tribune" published an editorial on November 2nd regarding the situation of the struggle against the criminal law amendment, saying that every effort should be made to make the various mass rallies to be held on November 6th "become demonstrations for freedom that are unprecedentedly powerful in the country."

The editorial said that the Australian Council of Trade Unions' involvement in this movement provides a favorable basis for launching a huge national movement to unite all Australian people to defend democratic rights and thwart the bill that has been submitted to Parliament.

The "Tribune" pointed out that the Australian Communist Party had already pointed out the fascist threat of the amendment several months ago; and now, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, together with the Australian Communist Party, has joined this movement.

The "Tribune" exposed Attorney General Barwick's attempt to use rhetoric to ease the mass struggle and create divisions among those who oppose the amendment. The editorial said that Barwick has been trying his best to say that the amendment is not actually as its provisions state. "Tribune" said: "However, Barwick's promise to make minor modifications to the amendment does not change the reactionary nature of the bill at all."

Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch: Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, expressed his deep sympathy and support for the just struggle of Australian workers against the criminal law amendment in a telegram to Monk, Chairman of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, today. The telegram said: "We believe that as long as the Australian working class and the people of the whole country unite as one and persevere in the struggle, your struggle will surely be victorious."

    新华社2日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚工会理事会正在为11月6日“全国抗议日”在澳大利亚全国各大城市举行大规模的劳工运动群众大会进行组织工作，来抗议孟席斯政府制定的法西斯的刑法修正案。
    目前，参加反对刑法修正案的斗争的，包括澳大利亚的几乎所有的工会，以及和平、妇女和青年组织。在新南威尔士南海岸的钢铁工业地区渥隆贡—开姆布拉港的一万四千工人举行了罢工，来反对这个法西斯刑法修正案，并派遣了由四百人组成的抗议代表团到堪培拉去（目前议会正在那里讨论刑法修正案）。
    在下星期，纽卡斯尔的煤钢工业地区也将派出庞大的代表团。现在每天都有代表团从悉尼前往堪培拉去向政界人士提出他们的意见。
    工人们已经起来反抗，并且毫不犹豫地表示了他们对修正案的态度。他们要求采取强有力的步骤来阻止修正案变成法律。
    参加这个全国规模的反对刑法修正案斗争的，已经不限于工会、青年、妇女组织。教会、法律界人士以及澳大利亚的一些著名作家，包括吉尔摩夫人，普理查德·曼等等，也都参加了这个斗争。
      “论坛报”11月2日就反对刑法修正案的斗争形势发表社论说：应该竭尽全力使将在11月6日举行的各个群众大会“变成在国内空前强大的争取自由的示威”。
    社论说，澳大利亚工会理事会投入这个运动，为发动巨大的全国性运动来团结全体澳大利亚人民以保卫民主权利和挫败这项已提交议会的法案，提供了有利的基础。
  “论坛报”指出，几个月以前，澳大利亚共产党已经指出了修正案的法西斯主义的威胁；而现在，澳大利亚工会理事会，同澳大利亚共产党一道，投入了这个运动。
      “论坛报”揭露检察长巴威克企图用花言巧语缓和群众斗争，并在反对修正案的人中制造分裂的阴谋。社论说，巴威克已经在想尽办法说什么修正案在事实上并不是像它的条文所说的那样。“论坛报”说：“但是，巴威克要对修正案稍作修改的许诺，根本没有改变这个法案的反动性质。”
    据新华社5日讯　中华全国总工会主席刘宁一今天在致澳大利亚工会理事会主席蒙克的一份电报中，表示十分同情和支持澳大利亚工人为反对刑法修正案所进行的正义斗争。电报说：“我们相信，只要澳大利亚工人阶级和全国人民团结一致，坚持斗争，你们的斗争必将取得胜利。”
