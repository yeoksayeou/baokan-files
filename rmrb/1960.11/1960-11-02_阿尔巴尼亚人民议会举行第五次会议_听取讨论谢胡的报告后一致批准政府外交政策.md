    新华社地拉那31日电　阿尔巴尼亚第四届人民议会25日和26日在此间举行了第五次会议。
    人民议会主席团主席列希、人民议会主席什图拉、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查、部长会议主席谢胡等党政领导人都出席了会议，人民政府各部部长和各国驻阿尔巴尼亚外交使节也出席了会议。
    会议听取并讨论了谢胡所作的关于国际形势和外交政策的报告，会议一致批准了阿尔巴尼亚政府的外交政策，同时批准了由谢胡率领的出席联合国大会第十五届会议的阿尔巴尼亚代表团所进行的工作。
    会议还批准了第四次会议以来，人民议会主席团所公布的一些法令。会议鉴于丽·贝利绍娃在党和政府的政治路线方面所犯的错误，决定解除她人民议会主席团委员的职务，这个职务由里·马尔科担任。由于议员科·塔什科辜负选民的信任，会议决定撤销其代表资格。
