　　Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 22nd: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 3 Steelmaking Plant is carrying out a mass "inspect for hidden dangers, eliminate hidden dangers" equipment maintenance campaign, eliminating accidents before they occur, and ensuring the healthy development of the rapid steelmaking movement.

　　The plant's Deputy Party Secretary, Plant Director, Deputy Plant Directors, and other leading cadres all went to the open-hearth furnace, ingot casting, raw materials, and equipment workshops to inspect the main equipment; each workshop formed a three-way combination professional team composed of leading cadres, technicians, and veteran workers. At the same time, they mobilized workers to carefully inspect the equipment they use in conjunction with production. Since the start of this campaign in November, the plant has identified more than 500 hidden equipment dangers.

　　Through inspection and treatment, many hidden equipment dangers have been eliminated in a timely manner. The equipment workshop inspected and found that a waste "return water pipe" of the No. 3 open-hearth furnace was leaking water and corroding the furnace body. They immediately held a meeting to study the problem and replaced the waste "return water pipe" in just two hours while the open-hearth furnace was in normal production. The ingot casting workshop concentrated the wisdom of all the bricklayers in the workshop and improved the bricklaying method between the taphole and the spout joint, overcoming the problem of steel leakage in this area. Wan Chunyang, a worker who repairs cranes, found that the foundation bolts of the No. 3 ingot casting machine were loose and immediately tightened them on the spot, preventing a possible serious accident.

　　Through this campaign, the factory mobilized employees to revise and supplement various rules and regulations such as equipment maintenance, regular overhauls, responsibility systems, and technical operating procedures, and strengthened daily equipment maintenance. In the past, the reason why the water-cooled equipment of the open-hearth furnace had many leaks was that there was no one to weld and repair them. This time, a responsibility system for welding and repairing by specialized personnel was established. In the past, the furnace patching machine was only repaired when it broke down, and there was no inspection system. Now, regular inspections are also required. The steel ladle bands often cracked. After finding the cause of the cracks, the regulations in the operating procedures were revised. In the past, the taphole of a newly repaired open-hearth furnace was prone to steel leakage. After workers discussed the problem, the reason was that the taphole was damp, so they added "bake the taphole dry before tapping" to the operating procedures. In order to maintain the furnace body better, the open-hearth furnace foreman also established a three-check system for each shift: inspection at the beginning of the shift, inspection during the shift, and inspection at the end of the shift.

    勤查勤修预防事故
    新华社鞍山22日电　鞍山钢铁公司第三炼钢厂开展群众性的“查隐患、灭隐患”的设备维护工作，把事故消灭在发生之前，保证快速炼钢运动健康地发展。
    这个厂的党委副书记、厂长、副厂长等领导干部，都分别到平炉、铸锭、原料、设备车间检查主要设备；各车间都由领导干部和技术员、老工人组成三结合专业小组，同时发动工人结合生产认真检查自己所使用的设备。11月份开展这个运动以来，全厂已经检查出各种设备隐患五百多项。
    经过边检查、边处理，许多设备隐患及时消灭。设备车间检查出三号平炉炉门一根废“回水管”漏水，浸蚀炉体，便立即开会研究，只用两个小时就在平炉正常生产的情况下把这根废“回水管”换了下来。铸锭车间集中了全车间瓦工的智慧，改进了出钢口和出钢槽接头之间的砌砖法，克服了这个地方漏钢的毛病。检修吊车的工人宛春阳，查出三号铸锭机的地脚螺丝松动，立即就地拧固，防止了可能发生的恶性事故。
    通过这个运动，工厂发动职工修订和补充了设备维护、定期检修、责任制、技术操作规程等各项规程制度，加强了日常的设备维护工作。过去平炉的水冷设备漏眼多的原因是没有专人焊补，这次便建立了专人焊补的责任制度。补炉机过去是坏了才修，没有检修制度，现在也规定要实行定期检修。钢水缶的缶带常常裂纹，这次找出裂纹的原因以后，修改了操作规程中的规定。过去平炉新修好以后出钢口容易漏钢，经过工人讨论，原因是出钢口潮了，就把“烤干出钢口再出钢”这一条列入操作规程。平炉炉长为了把炉体维护得更好，还建立了接班检查、班中检查、交班检查的一班三查制度。
