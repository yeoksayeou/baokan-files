Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: The United States and the Japanese Ikeda government are stepping up their plans to expand Japan's Ground "Self-Defense Force" by means of coercion and deception, and to develop Japan's fascist military forces.

As the Japanese people are unwilling to serve as cannon fodder for the US-Japan reactionaries, the number of Japanese volunteering to join the "Self-Defense Force" is decreasing day by day. According to Kyodo News, this situation has made the US Military Advisory Group, which controls the command of the Japanese "Self-Defense Force," pay attention to the "issue of complete staffing." They believe that "this is an issue that needs to be reviewed jointly by the United States and Japan," and say that ways to quickly replenish "Self-Defense Force" members must be studied.

According to statistics from the Ikeda government's "Defense Agency," the prescribed establishment of the Ground "Self-Defense Force" for this fiscal year (until March of next year) is 170,000 men, but the actual number now is only 152,000. The "Defense Agency" admits that although there are plans to recruit four times and employ 28,000 people this year, this target will be difficult to achieve. The "Defense Agency" also said that, on the other hand, an increasing number of soldiers in active service will request to retire, and it estimates that the number of retirements will be nearly 30,000 by the end of this year. The "Defense Agency" said that by the end of this fiscal year, there will definitely be a shortage of 17,000 to 20,000 people.

Based on the above situation, the US Military Advisory Group and the Japanese "Defense Agency" are considering adopting deceptive means such as "guaranteeing" that soldiers can "find employment" after retirement and forcing members to extend their terms of service in order to strengthen this force of Japanese militarism.

    指使日本加紧扩充军队
    军事顾问团督促池田政府加强“自卫队”
    新华社讯　东京消息：美国和日本池田政府正加紧策划用强迫和欺骗办法来扩充日本陆上“自卫队”，发展日本法西斯军事力量。
    由于日本人民不愿为美日反动派充当炮灰，日本志愿参加“自卫队”的人数日益减少。据共同社报道，这种情况使得掌握着日本“自卫队”指挥权的美国军事顾问团对“编制完整问题”重视起来，他们认为，“这是一个需要美日两国一起来审议的问题”，并且说，必须研究迅速补足“自卫队”队员的办法。
    据池田政府的“防卫厅”的统计，陆上“自卫队”本年度（至明年3月）规定的编制是十七万人，但是，现在实际人数只有十五万二千多人。“防卫厅”承认，虽然计划在本年度内招募四次，录用二万八千人，可是，这个指标很难完成。“防卫厅”又说，另一方面，在现役人员中还将有越来越多的士兵要求退伍，它估计到今年年底退伍人数将近三万人。“防卫厅”说，到本年度末肯定将缺少一万七千人到二万人。
    根据上述情况，美国军事顾问团和日本“防卫厅”正在考虑采取
  “保障”士兵在退役后能够“就业”的欺骗手段和强迫队员延长服役期限等办法，来加强这支日本军国主义力量。
