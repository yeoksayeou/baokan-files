    The Story of a One Hundred Yuan Bonus

    Recently, our branch store ranked first on the bumper harvest honor roll of the First Production Team. The production team leader even wrote a big-character poster: "The branch store is 'timely rain,' increased production is thanks to the branch store."

    Speaking of this matter, it started this spring.

    At the beginning of the spring plowing season, the Provincial Department of Commerce awarded our South Cha Branch Store of the Guai'er Supply and Marketing General Store in Zuoquan County, an advanced collective unit for 1959, a one hundred yuan bonus. After the money was distributed, some people advocated building a beautiful street gatehouse; some people advocated papering the east counter room and buying a red lacquered desk... However, Hao Yuqi, the manager of the branch store, thought that the First Production Team of the South Cha Management Bureau still had twenty-six mu of third-class land without base fertilizer. It was too late to organize the commune members to collect farm manure. It was estimated that the production team would not be able to raise funds for chemical fertilizer for a while, so it would be better to use the one hundred yuan bonus to buy fertilizer for the production team. He brought up his thoughts to discuss with everyone, and everyone agreed. So, they used this one hundred yuan bonus to buy one thousand two hundred catties of chemical fertilizer and sent it to the First Production Team.

    When autumn came, these twenty-six mu of third-class land, due to timely spring planting and sufficient fertilizer, achieved a bumper harvest, with an increase of more than one thousand two hundred catties of grain compared to last year.

    一百元奖金的故事
    最近，在第一生产队的丰产光荣榜上，我们分销店名列第一，生产队长还写了一张大字报：“分销店是‘及时雨’，增产多亏分销店。”
    提起这件事，要从今年春天说起。
    春耕开始时，省商业厅奖给我们1959年度先进集体单位、左权县拐儿供销总店南岔分销店一百元奖金。钱发下来以后，有人主张修个漂亮的街门楼；有人主张把东柜房裱糊裱糊，再买上个红漆办公桌………。但是，分销店的经理郝玉启却想到南岔管理局第一生产队有二十六亩三等地的底肥还没有着落，组织社员搞农家肥已经来不及，卖给他们化肥罢，估计生产队里一时筹不上款，倒不如把一百元奖金垫给生产队买肥料。他把自己的心思提出来和大家商量，人人都赞成。于是，他们就把这一百元奖金买了一千二百斤化肥送到第一生产队去。
    秋天到了，这二十六亩三等地由于春种适时，肥料足，获得了大丰收，比去年增产了一千二百多斤粮食。
