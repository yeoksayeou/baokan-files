Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Dispatch: Yangtze River ports along the entire line have launched a "Thousand-Ton Class" competition, greatly reducing the time ships stay in port and accelerating ship turnaround. Since September, the average port stay time for ships along the entire line has been reduced to about 1.81 days, lower than the original target of 1.9 days. Cargo congestion at various ports has been basically eliminated.

The central content of the "Thousand-Ton Class" competition is to concentrate efforts to achieve high-speed loading and unloading operations, with each eight-hour shift exceeding one thousand tons of cargo. This movement was first initiated by workers at Huangshi Port.

The Yangtze River Shipping Bureau's freight volume and freight turnover this year have greatly increased compared to previous years, especially the transportation volume of key materials such as grain and steel, which has increased even more significantly. In order to adapt to the continuously increasing transportation volume, Huangshi Port proposed the slogan "Work Shift Exceeds a Thousand" in March and April. In August and September, with the deepening of the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration used the slogan "Double Capacity (loading and unloading), Halve Port Stay (time), Work Shift Exceeds a Thousand (tons), Ships Don't Exceed a Day" as the target for port operations along the entire Yangtze River line. Since then, the "Thousand-Ton Class" movement has swept across the entire river.

Each port has unified the deployment of labor, rationally allocated various types of work, coordinated equipment into complete sets, implemented multi-channel operations, and launched competitions. In early and mid-October, the berthing time of ships in Jiujiang, Tongling, Wuhu, Digang, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai ports had all been reduced to below the original target. According to preliminary statistics, the reduction in port stay time in September alone, compared to August, saved 369,272 ton-days of transportation capacity, equivalent to increasing the operating volume of fifteen 800-ton barges for one month.

The development of the "Thousand-Ton Class" competition has greatly promoted the spirit of cooperation among workers along the entire Yangtze River line. After the Hankou-Shanghai liner changed its operating hours, Shanghai Port had difficulties with night shifts. Wuhan Port took the initiative to give up the day shift and do the night shift itself, ensuring that ships departed on time.

Recently, three "Thousand-Ton Class" red flags have been established along the entire river: the first operating area of Wuhan Port in the middle reaches, Wuhu Port in the lower reaches, and the third operating area of Chongqing Port in the upper reaches, further leading the "Thousand-Ton Class" movement towards a large-scale harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Dispatch: In the vigorous promotion of loading and unloading mechanization, the Chongqing Municipal Transportation Department continuously breaks through new weak links, continuously grasps the use, consolidation, improvement, and matching of new equipment into complete sets. Currently, the city has built 144 cable cars, 508 chutes, and more than 20,000 pieces of various booms and belt conveyors, out-of-warehouse machines, and other loading and unloading equipment, completely changing the face of transportation in various ports, docks, factories, and mines. Vehicle and ship turnaround time has been greatly shortened, and the output per ton of vehicles and ships has more than doubled, while also saving a large amount of labor.

Chongqing is a mountain city with many mountains and steep slopes. The urban area is separated by the Yangtze River and the Jialing River, and the volume of cargo loading and unloading is very large. Transporting a raw material from its place of origin to the factory requires transportation by several modes of transport, such as trains, (wooden) boats, and automobiles, as well as four or five loading and unloading operations; transporting goods from the wharf to the shore for loading onto vehicles also requires climbing dozens of meters of slopes. Therefore, in the past, the situation of vehicles and ships running in the middle but being held up at both ends was relatively serious. In response to this situation, this year, in carrying out the technical revolution movement, relevant units have widely mobilized the masses to adopt methods that are adapted to local conditions and combine indigenous and foreign methods, vigorously engaging in loading and unloading mechanization to achieve cable car operations for uphill, chute operations for downhill, rail transport on level ground, cableways in the air, and tunnels underground. For example, the Chongqing Cement Plant originally required 1,400 people to transport 1,300 tons of cement per day. After the workers took advantage of their spare time to build five cable cars and four chutes, 250 people were able to transport 2,500 tons per day. Various transportation units also use different machines for transporting different goods, such as bottom-opening vehicles or hoppers with high platforms and low cargo positions for bulk materials, various conveying machines for packaged materials, and pipelines for liquid materials.

After the city's major ports and docks basically solved the problem of loading and unloading transportation uphill and downhill, the processes of lifting cargo from holds, lifting cargo from the shore, and stacking still required a large amount of manual labor. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China then launched an "upgrade" movement of "four transformations" at the city's docks and ports, mobilizing the workers and masses to build out-of-warehouse machines, "Young Pioneer" derricks, belt conveyors, and other transport equipment, and to build high platforms and low cargo positions, coordinating them with cable cars and chutes to form a linked loading and unloading transportation line, initially breaking through weak links such as arrayed loading and unloading, lifting cargo from holds, and stacking. For example, because the banks of the river are steep and the water is shallow, large ships cannot directly dock, and most loading and unloading operations take place in the middle of the river. The biggest difficulty in using machinery for loading and unloading operations in the middle of the river is the power supply. The port authority's workers actively found ways to install diesel engines, generators, and booms on one ship at the same time, creating a river-center loading and unloading operation ship, solving the major key problem of lifting cargo from holds and stacking in river-center operations.

### 实现高速装卸　缩短停港时间　加速船舶周转  长江各港口开展“千吨班”竞赛  重庆交通运输部门大搞装卸机具机械化运输效率大大提高

    实现高速装卸　缩短停港时间　加速船舶周转
    长江各港口开展“千吨班”竞赛
    重庆交通运输部门大搞装卸机具机械化运输效率大大提高
    据新华社武汉电　长江全线各港口开展“千吨班”竞赛运动，大大压缩了船舶的停港时间，加速了船舶周转，从9月份以来全线船舶停港时间已压缩到一点八一天左右，低于原定一点九天的指标；各港口基本上消灭了货物堵塞现象。
    “千吨班”竞赛的中心内容是：集中力量，实现高速装卸作业，每班八小时作业量突破一千吨。这个运动是黄石港职工首先发起的。
    长江航运局今年的货运量、货运周转量比往年大大增加，特别是重点物资如粮食、钢铁物资的运输量增长幅度更大。为了适应运量不断增加的情况，黄石港在3、4月份提出了“工班超千”的行动口号。8、9月份，随着增产节约运动的深入展开，长江航运管理局以“能力（装卸）翻番，停港（时间）砍半，工班超千（吨），船不超天”的口号，作为长江全线港口作业的目标。自此，“千吨班”运动席卷全江。
    各港都统一调度劳力，合理配置各工种，将机具设备配套成龙，实行多路作业，开展竞赛。10月上中旬，九江、铜陵、芜湖、荻港、南京、镇江、上海各港的船只停泊时间，都已降低到原定指标以下。据初步统计，全线仅9月份比8月份压缩停港时间而节约的运力即达三十六万九千二百七十二吨天，相当于增加十五条载重八百吨的驳船一个月的营运量。
    “千吨班”竞赛运动的开展，促使长江全线职工的协作风格大大发扬。在汉口——上海班轮更改运行时间后，上海港做夜班有困难，武汉港又主动让出白班，自己做夜班，并保证船舶按时发航。
    最近，全江已树立起三面“千吨班”红旗：中段的武汉港第一作业区，下段的芜湖港，上段的重庆港第三作业区，把“千吨班”运动进一步引向大面积丰收。
    据新华社重庆电　重庆市交通运输部门在大搞装卸机械化运动中，不断突破新的薄弱环节、不断抓新机具的使用和巩固、提高、配套成龙。现在，全市已建成缆车一百四十四条，梭槽五百零八条，各种吊杆和皮带运输机、出仓机等装卸设备二万多件，彻底改变了各港口、码头、厂矿运输的面貌。车船周转时间大大缩短，车吨船吨产量都提高了两倍以上，还节约了大量劳动力。
    重庆是一座山城，山多坡陡，市区被长江和嘉陵江相隔，货物装卸量很大。一种原料从产地运到工厂，要经过火车、轮（木）船、汽车等几种运输工具运输和四、五次装卸；货物从码头运到岸边装车，也要爬几十米的斜坡。因而，过去车船跑在中间、窝在两头的情况较为严重。针对这种情况，今年在开展技术革命运动中，有关单位都广泛发动群众，采用因地制宜、土洋结合的办法，大搞装卸机械化，实现上坡缆车化，下坡梭槽化，平地轨道化，空中架索道，地下掘隧道。如重庆水泥厂原来一千四百人一天运一千三百吨水泥。职工利用业余时间，突击建成五条缆车、四条梭槽以后，二百五十人每天就能运二千五百吨。各运输单位对各种货物也采用不同的机具运输，如散装物资用底开门车或漏斗配合高站台、低货位用，包装的物资采用各种输送机具运输，液体物资用管道运输。
    全市主要港口、码头，基本上解决了上坡下坡的装卸运输问题以后，起舱、起岸、堆码等仍要辅以大量的人力劳动。中共重庆市委就又在全市码头、港口掀起一个“四化”升级运动，发动职工群众大造出舱机、少先吊、皮带运输机等运输机具，大建高站台、低货位，与缆车、梭槽配套成龙，建成装卸运输联动线，初步突破了成列装卸、起舱、堆码等薄弱环节。如由于江边坡陡水浅，大船不能直接靠岸，河心装卸作业多。而在河心装卸作业中使用机械最大的困难是电源问题。港务局的职工就积极设法，在一条船上同时安上了柴油机、发电机和吊杆，制成了河心装卸作业船，解决了河心作业中起舱、堆码的大关键。
