Quality First—From the Kunming Xishan Agricultural Machinery Factory

    Quality Model Worker Dong Xue
    Dong Xue is a lathe operator at the Xishan District Agricultural Machinery Factory. Because he consistently values quality, the factory workers have repeatedly selected him as a model worker.
    Dong Xue's home is in the Dongfeng People's Commune in Xishan District. During holidays, he often returns to the village to visit relatives and friends, learning about the changes in the countryside. The villagers' requirements for agricultural machinery are a great spur to Dong Xue. He often thinks: We are workers who directly serve agricultural production, and agriculture is our own business. The quality of our products directly affects agricultural production. He strictly demands of himself, studies diligently and practices hard. In the manufacturing of various agricultural machines, he pays special attention to quality. He discovered that the parts of the flour milling machine were not interchangeable, so he actively looked for solutions. He found some scrap iron in the scrap pile and made three sets of plug gauges, ring gauges, calipers, and templates to measure the dimensions of the processed parts, improving product quality and ensuring that the parts were all the same size. The output also increased significantly. It used to take twenty hours to turn a large part of a flour milling machine, but later it was shortened to ten hours to turn eight pieces. The efficiency of the entire team in processing flour milling machine parts increased threefold. After the factory switched to producing threshers, he applied this set of innovative tools to the processing of large gears, clamping teeth, and bearing plates, ensuring the quality of the threshers. Under his leadership, the lathe operator team completed its production tasks monthly, on time, and above quota, and won the title of advanced team.

专栏：质量第一——在昆明西山农业机械厂里

    质量标兵董学
    董学是西山区农业机械厂的车工，因为他一贯重视质量，厂里职工一再选他当标兵。
    董学的家就在西山区东风人民公社。假日，他经常回村去看望亲友，了解农村的变化。亲人们对农业机具的要求，对董学是很大的鞭策。他经常想：我们是直接为农业生产服务的工人，农业的事就是自己的事，产品的好坏直接关系着农业生产。他严格要求自己，勤学苦练，在制造各种农机中，特别注意质量。他发现磨面机的零件不能互换，就积极想办法，到废料堆里找来几块废铁，造了三套塞规、套规、卡板和样板，用来测量加工零件的尺寸，提高了产品质量，实现了零件规格一个样。产量也有很大提高，原来要二十小时才能车一件磨面机的大机件，后来缩短到十小时就能车好八件；全小组加工磨面机零件的效率提高了三倍。厂里转入生产打谷机后，他又把这套革新工具用到加工大齿盘、夹齿和轴承板上，保证了打谷机的质量，在他的带动下，车工小组月月都按质、按时地超额完成了生产任务，获得了先进小组的称号。
