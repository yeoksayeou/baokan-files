Xinhua News Agency, 20th November. The China-Latin America Friendship Association held a reception this evening to warmly welcome the Economic Delegation of the Cuban Revolutionary Government led by Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba.

Vice Premier of the State Council, Li Xiannian; Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Guo Moruo; Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Bao Erhan; Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Zhang Zhizhong; Minister of Foreign Trade, Ye Jizhuang; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhang Hanfu; Chinese Ambassador to Cuba, Shen Jian; President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association, Chu Tunan; Vice President, Zhou Erfu, and others attended the reception.

Foreign guests and students from various Latin American countries in Beijing were also invited to attend the reception.

At the reception, which was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere, the hosts and guests engaged in cordial conversations, frequently raising their glasses to toast the militant friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples, the victory of the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialism, and the victory of the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Chu Tunan spoke at the reception.

He extended a warm welcome on behalf of the China-Latin America Friendship Association to the envoys of the heroic Cuban people. He pointed out that the visit of the distinguished Cuban guests to China is a major event in the development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Cuba.

Chu Tunan said that the Chinese and Cuban peoples are close brothers and comrades-in-arms, and we have been closely linked together in the common struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and interference. Chu Tunan angrily condemned U.S. imperialism for recently dispatching naval and air forces to the Caribbean Sea to carry out armed provocations and intensifying its threats and armed aggression against Cuba. He strongly stated that the 650 million Chinese people resolutely support their Cuban brothers. Any invasion of Cuba by U.S. imperialism will be met with resolute resistance and a shameful defeat. He pointed out that although U.S. imperialism is still trying to play various conspiracies and deceptive tricks, it can never save its dying fate.

Delegation leader Guevara said at the reception that today he was not speaking as a representative of Cuba, but as a member of the Latin American people who are fighting for freedom, because today's reception was hosted by the China-Latin America Friendship Association.

He said that the people of Latin American countries are a whole, just as Martí said, they are a group of children of our American mother. In this big family, due to the divisive actions of imperialism, the people of Latin American countries are temporarily separated from each other and do not understand each other, but now the people of various countries are united, and they have utilized experience that is very valuable to us all. He particularly pointed out that because the history of the great Chinese revolution, the history of China's struggle and victory, has become the experience of the people of Latin American countries, and has become a medium for our people to contact each other.

Guevara said that the situation in the Americas is similar to that here, where feudalism ruled for hundreds of years, followed by colonialism, and our people lived under oppression like the Chinese people in the past. Therefore, our path to liberation may also be similar in some respects.

Guevara emphasized that in addition to the historical experience of the past, the Chinese people have also pointed out today's experience for us. Today's China is such a great reality: the most populous country in the world, 650 million people, is overcoming all kinds of huge difficulties with unparalleled enthusiasm to rapidly build a better world. In the achievements of the communes and all the social systems adopted in China, there are also many things that we should learn. He pointed out that perhaps this is a method that the Americas must take in the future when it takes the first step of the workers and peasants gaining power and embarking on the road to liberation.

Guevara repeatedly emphasized that there are many things worth learning from your advancing nation, your various systems, and from your entire modern history, especially that we Latin Americans can draw many lessons from it.

Guevara's words aroused bursts of warm applause.

At the reception, artists from the capital performed wonderful Chinese and Cuban songs and musical programs to add to the fun. Actors from the Chinese art troupe who had recently visited Cuba and other Latin American countries sang the Cuban folk song "Selling Peanuts." After the three actresses finished singing, they ran off the stage and presented packages of peanuts to Guevara and other distinguished guests. At this time, there was a burst of warm applause in the hall.

    中拉友协欢宴古巴政府经济代表团
    李先念副总理等出席招待会，楚图南会长、格瓦拉团长讲了话  宾主频频为中古人民友谊、为古巴人民反对美帝国主义斗争的胜利干杯
    新华社20日讯　中国拉丁美洲友好协会，今天晚上举行招待会，热烈欢迎由古巴国家银行行长埃·切·格瓦拉少校率领的古巴革命政府经济代表团。
    国务院副总理李先念，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中，对外贸易部部长叶季壮，外交部副部长章汉夫，中国驻古巴大使申健，中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南、副会长周而复等出席了招待会。
    在北京的拉丁美洲各国外宾和留学生也应邀出席了招待会。
    在充满着热烈、友好气氛的招待会上，宾主亲切交谈，大家频频举杯，为中古两国人民的战斗友谊，为古巴人民反对美帝国主义斗争的胜利，为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族民主运动的胜利干杯。
    楚图南在招待会上讲话。
    他代表中国拉丁美洲友好协会向英雄的古巴人民的使者表示热烈的欢迎。他指出，古巴贵宾们这次访问中国是发展中古两国友好合作关系中的重大事情。
    楚图南说，中古两国人民是亲密的兄弟和战友，在反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉的共同斗争中，我们一直紧密地联系在一起。楚图南愤怒地谴责美帝国主义最近出动海军、空军到加勒比海进行武装挑衅和加紧对古巴的威胁和武装侵略。他强烈地表示，六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持古巴弟兄。美帝国主义对古巴的任何进犯，必将遭到坚决的还击和可耻的失败。他指出：尽管美帝国主义还企图玩弄各种阴谋和欺骗的花样，但是绝不能挽救它垂死的命运。
    格瓦拉团长在招待会上说，今天他不是作为古巴的代表讲话，而是要作为正在为自由而斗争的拉丁美洲人的一分子讲话，因为今天的招待会是中国拉丁美洲友好协会举办的。
    他说，拉丁美洲各国人民是一个整体，正如马蒂所说那样，他们是我们的美洲母亲的一群孩子。在这个大家庭中，由于帝国主义的分裂行动，拉丁美洲各国人民暂时彼此很隔阂，彼此不了解，然而现在各个国家的人们是团结起来了，他们利用了对我们大家都很宝贵的经验。他特别指出，因为伟大的中国革命的历史、中国的斗争和胜利的历史成了拉丁美洲各国人民的经验，而且成了我们各国人民相互接触的媒介。
    格瓦拉说，美洲的情况和这里是相似的，在那里封建主义统治了几百年，接着又来了殖民主义，我们的人民像中国人民过去一样在压迫下过日子。因此，我们解放的道路在某些方面也可能是相似的。
    格瓦拉强调说，除了过去的历史经验之外，中国人民还为我们指出了今天的经验。今天的中国是这样一个伟大的现实：世界上人口最多的国家六亿五千万人以无比的热情，克服所遇到的各种巨大困难，来迅速建设一个更加美好的世界。在公社和中国所采用的一切社会制度的成就中，也有许多东西是我们应该学习的。他指出，也许这是将来美洲在迈出了工农取得政权的第一步而走上解放的道路时，所必须采取的一个办法。
    格瓦拉最后一再强调说，你们这个前进中的民族，你们的各种制度，以及从你们的整个近代历史中，有许多值得学习的东西，特别是我们拉丁美洲人可以从中吸取许多教益。
    格瓦拉的这些话，激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。
    招待会上，首都文艺工作者演出中国和古巴的精彩歌曲和音乐节目助兴。不久前访问古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家归来的中国艺术团的演员，演唱了古巴民歌“卖花生”。三名女演员唱完之后跑下台去，把装着花生的纸包献给格瓦拉等贵宾。这时，会场上发出了一片热烈的掌声。
