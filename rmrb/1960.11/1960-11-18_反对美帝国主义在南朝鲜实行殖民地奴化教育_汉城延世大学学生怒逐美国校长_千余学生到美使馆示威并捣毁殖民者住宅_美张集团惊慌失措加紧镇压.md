Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 17th -- News from Seoul: More than 1,400 students from Seoul's Yonsei University, in order to oppose American imperialism's implementation of colonialist slave education in South Korea, expelled the acting principal, the American Enderwood, from the school. On the morning of the 16th, they destroyed Enderwood's residence and held a demonstration in front of the American Embassy, demanding that Enderwood, who had fled into the American Embassy, and the school's "Chairman of the Board of Trustees" - the American pastor Sauer, immediately return to the United States.

According to a report by Tonghwa News Agency, on that day, early in the morning, the students of Yonsei University convened a student assembly, passing a resolution demanding that Enderwood and Sauer resign and that they rescind the decision to expel three students as retaliation against the students. Afterwards, the students surged to Enderwood's house, surrounded his residence, and demanded that he come out for a meeting. When the students heard that Enderwood had fled upon hearing the news, they could no longer contain the indignation in their chests and destroyed all the glass windows and furniture in Enderwood's residence. At this time, the puppet authorities dispatched a large number of police to suppress the students, but they were all repelled by the angry students.

After this, the students gathered in front of the American Embassy and held a demonstration for more than an hour. Here, the students exposed and condemned the crimes of Enderwood and Sauer, strongly demanding that they be immediately sent back to the United States. In the afternoon, the students also destroyed Sauer's residence.

Faced with the surging anti-American struggle of the students, the American imperialists and their running dog, the Chang Myon clique, were panic-stricken. On the one hand, they obsequiously apologized to the American Embassy, and on the other hand, they carried out a large-scale suppression of the students. On that day, the Chang Myon clique continued to mobilize more than 700 policemen to arrest more than 200 students from Yonsei University. In addition, they ordered 3,000 policemen to be in "emergency standby." On the afternoon of the same day, the American Chargé d'Affaires in Seoul, Green, held a long secret talk with the puppet "Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs."

The struggle of Yonsei University students to expel the American colonist Enderwood from the school began in September. After the outbreak of this struggle, Chang Myon obsequiously declared that Enderwood was a "meritorious figure" in South Korea's education circle, expressing his intention to "severely punish according to the law" those Yonsei University students who opposed Enderwood.

    汉城延世大学学生怒逐美国校长
    千余学生到美使馆示威并捣毁殖民者住宅  美张集团惊慌失措加紧镇压
    新华社平壤17日电　汉城消息：汉城延世大学的一千四百多名学生为了反对美帝国主义在南朝鲜实行殖民地奴化教育，驱逐代理校长美国人恩德乌德出校，16日上午捣毁了恩德乌德的住宅，并在美国大使馆前面举行示威，要躲进美国大使馆的恩德乌德和学校的“财团理事长”——美国牧师萨乌尔立即滚回美国去。
    据同和通讯社报道，这一天清晨，延世大学的学生们召开了学生大会，通过决议要恩德乌德和萨乌尔辞职，并要他们收回为了对学生进行报复而开除三名学生的决定。以后学生们就涌到恩德乌德的家里去，把他的住宅包围了起来，要他出来面谈。当学生们听说恩德乌德闻风逃走以后，就再也忍不住胸中的郁愤，把恩德乌德住宅的玻璃窗和家具全部捣毁。这时傀儡当局出动大批警察前来镇压，但是都被愤怒的学生击退了。
    在这以后，学生们涌聚到美国大使馆前举行了一个多小时的示威，在这里，学生们揭露和谴责了恩德乌德和萨乌尔的罪行，强硬要求立即把他们送回美国。下午学生们又捣毁了萨乌尔的住宅。
    美帝国主义者和它的走狗张勉集团在学生们高涨的反美斗争面前惊慌失措，一面卑躬屈膝地向美国大使馆道歉，另一面则对学生大肆镇压。张勉集团当天继续动员了七百多名警察逮捕了二百多名延世大学的学生。另外还命令三千名警察
  “紧急待命”。当天下午，美国驻汉城代办格林同傀儡
  “外务次官”进行了长时间的密谈。
    延世大学学生驱逐美国殖民者恩德乌德出校的斗争从9月间就开始了。在这场斗争爆发后，张勉就奴颜婢膝地宣称恩德乌德是南朝鲜教育界
  “有功劳的大人物”，表示要“依法严惩”那些反对恩德乌德的延世大学学生。
