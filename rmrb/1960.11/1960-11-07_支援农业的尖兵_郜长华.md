A Pioneer Supporting Agriculture – Gao Changhua

*Henan Daily* Reporter

Communist Youth League member Gao Changhua is a third-grade fitter at the Jiaozuo Mining Machinery Factory. Several months ago, he responded to the Party's call to participate in the fight against drought in the countryside. He worked tirelessly, busying himself in the fields, repairing agricultural machinery for the commune and painstakingly imparting his technical skills, making outstanding achievements in supporting the agricultural harvest. Recently, at his repeated requests, the organization approved his settling down in the Macun Commune. He is determined to dedicate all his energy to changing the "poor and blank" face of the countryside and building a new socialist countryside.

	Going to the Countryside to Fight the Drought

Gao Changhua grew up in the countryside. In 1956, he came to the Jiaozuo Mining Machinery Factory because of the needs of the national construction cause. Over the past few years, under the education of the Party and the League, he has made rapid progress. He was once rated as a city-level pacesetter and attended the provincial conference of advanced producers on the industrial front. Although he left the countryside, he often cared about agricultural production. In particular, after the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation, it further improved his awareness of supporting agriculture. Whenever the busy farming season came, he always used his spare time and every opportunity to go to the countryside to help commune members repair machines and improve tools. At the end of March this year, when the drought demon threatened the growth of wheat, he felt very uneasy. One day, he said to the workshop leader: "The countryside is currently in great need of support in fighting the drought. Let me go and help repair the drainage and irrigation machinery." His request was approved, and he was so happy that he almost jumped up. That night, he didn't sleep until after one o'clock, searching through the factory's scrap piles for various parts needed for drainage and irrigation machinery. He sang as he searched, with indescribable joy. He recalled what the Party Secretary had said to him at ordinary times: "To support agriculture, we must produce more and better agricultural machinery. At present, production technology in the countryside is still relatively backward, and we need to use every opportunity and do everything possible to help them." Now that the opportunity had arrived, he felt full of energy.

		Working Selflessly

After arriving in the countryside, Gao Changhua worked as selflessly as he did in the factory. During the most intense period of drought resistance, he always went to the most difficult areas. Once, the members of the Guanzhuang squad dug a machine well more than six meters deep. The diesel engine had just been installed, but it suddenly broke down after only a few hours of operation. After Gao Changhua learned of this, he rushed there in the hot weather. The commune members saw him running with sweat all over his face and asked him to sit down and rest quickly. However, he immediately began to check the machine, working continuously for several hours, ignoring the scorching sun, and repaired the diesel engine. Who knew that the machine only ran for two hours before the water stopped coming out again. What was the reason? After careful inspection, he determined that there was nothing wrong with the machine itself and that it needed to be inspected down the well. At this time, the sun had already set, and he was tired and sleepy from several days of hard work and wanted to take a break. However, he thought, if it couldn't be repaired quickly and he had to watch the water stop coming out, how could this overcome the drought? Thinking of this, he picked up his tools and went down the well with a safety rope. The temperature inside the well was low, and the water splashing on his body from all around the well wall made him shiver. Gao Changhua didn't care about this and just carefully checked whether there was anything wrong with the water pump. Suddenly, he discovered that the speed of the machine and the water pump did not match. He believed this was the key problem, so he came up again and discussed with the commune members about increasing the pulley on the machine. Fearing that there would still be problems down the well, he went down to the well a second time and, together with the commune members, dug at the water intake of the pipeline and tightened the screws on the flanges at the connection of each water pipe. He persisted in the well for more than two hours until the water was discharged before he came up.

During the months that Gao Changhua worked in the countryside, he always thought: "Time is food," "With water, there is grain." Therefore, when encountering some difficulties, he always tried every possible means to find solutions. After the drought in the Jiaozuo area was relieved at the end of June, the drought resistance teams returned one after another, but he did not return. He took the time to modify the machines according to the characteristics of the countryside. The Mafang Brigade had a gas engine, and the person watching the machine found it too troublesome to burn coal, so they changed it to burning gasoline. After Gao Changhua learned about this, he and he went to other brigades to learn about underground gas stove experience, saving a lot of gasoline.

	Painstakingly Imparting Technology

During his days in the countryside, Gao Changhua saw more than once that some machines with minor problems were left idle because no one repaired them. There were also some machines that were damaged because people were not skilled in operating them, preventing these machines from fully playing their role. Therefore, he was determined to pass on his technology to the farmers, doing everything possible to teach them how to use and repair machines. The commune members in the brigade and squad who were learning to operate machines generally had a low level of education and also wanted to learn quickly. In order to meet their requirements, Gao Changhua ate and lived with them, teaching them how to operate on site during the day and giving technical lessons in the evening, often not resting until late at night. Fan Shuiyong of the Mafang Brigade told everyone he met: "Master Gao has exhausted his efforts to teach me how to use my hand that held a hoe to operate foreign machines." Fan Shuiyong was older than other people learning to operate machines, and in addition, he had never attended school since he was a child. It was indeed difficult to learn the disassembly technology of machines in a very short period of time. Under this circumstance, Gao Changhua explained patiently and repeatedly, teaching him by counting on his fingers. With Gao Changhua's patient help, he has now finally become an excellent driver. In just a few months, he used these methods to enable more than 30 commune members in the Macun Commune to learn how to use and repair machines.

	Working in the Countryside for a Lifetime

In several months of actual work in the countryside, Gao Changhua increasingly felt that the countryside urgently needed the support of technical workers. In particular, whenever the drought resistance was intense and there were many accidents with drainage and irrigation machinery, and he was too busy to repair some machines in time, the peasant brothers always stood in front of the machines and said anxiously: "You are too tired alone, it would be good to have a few more people who can repair them," "If these machines are repaired one day earlier, we will grow a lot more grain," "Master Gao, stay here, what will happen if these machines break down after you leave?" Under this circumstance, Gao Changhua's determination to stay in the countryside became more and more firm. Therefore, he applied to the factory leadership, asking to work in the countryside for a lifetime. This request made the commune members happy. However, some individuals could not understand. Some people in the factory asked him face to face: "Many people want to go to the city, but you are running from the city to the countryside, why is this?" Gao Changhua said to them: "I don't want anything, just to respond to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, to help the peasant brothers carry out socialist construction and completely change the backward face of the countryside. This is the responsibility of the working class."

One evening, Gao Changhua was discussing the arrangement of autumn sowing labor with the brigade cadres when he suddenly received a notice from the factory Party committee. The notice said: "Comrade Gao Changhua, according to your request, the Party committee has decided to approve you to settle down in the countryside." He was immediately so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. He thought: My wish has been realized, and in the future, I must think of more ways to make greater achievements in supporting agriculture and fulfill the task assigned to me by the Party. After the meeting, it was late at night, but he did not rest. Sitting under the vegetable oil lamp, he pondered the question raised by the brigade Party branch of trying every possible means to free up labor to accelerate the autumn sowing. Suddenly, he thought that the mills for grinding grain in some squads used one or two head of livestock and several young and middle-aged laborers. How good it would be to drive them with machines.

Early the next morning, Gao Changhua found the seven-horsepower gas engine that was "sleeping." Zhang Xiaowu, the driver who had operated this machine, said to him: "It's hopeless, don't bother anymore." Gao Changhua said: "It is very much needed now, and we must find a way to make it run." As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeves and began a complex work of dismantling and cleaning. After a day of dismantling, repairing, and installing, the gas engine still could not be started. At this time, it was already dark, and the commune members had all returned to the canteen to eat, but he found Zhang Xiaowu again and finally figured out the "personality" of this machine, repaired the "piston ring" parts, and revived this machine that had been sleeping for a long time. Then, he went to the experienced old farmers to modify the stone mill. On the afternoon of the third day, the stone mill driven by the gas engine demonstrated its power. It replaced five or six head of livestock and more than 20 laborers, and could grind more than 2,000 kilograms of grain a day, which was enough for the entire brigade's commune members to eat for a day. The livestock and labor that were freed up were invested in the autumn sowing work, making the daily progress of the autumn sowing more than 20% higher than in the past. Zhao Baocheng, the secretary of the brigade branch, praised him again. Gao Changhua said: "I am a member of the commune, and there is still a lot of work to be done in the future!"

    支援农业的尖兵——郜长华
    河南日报记者
    共青团员郜长华，是焦作矿山机械厂的三级钳工。几个月以前，他响应党的号召，到农村参加抗旱斗争，不辞劳苦，奔忙田间，为公社修理农业机械，并苦心传授技术，为支援农业丰收做出了出色成就。最近，在他再三要求下，组织上批准了他留在马村公社安家落户。他决心为改变农村“一穷二白”的面貌，建设社会主义的新农村，献出自己的全部精力。
          下　乡　抗　旱
    郜长华从小就生长在农村。1956年因祖国建设事业的需要，来到了焦作矿山机械厂。几年来，在党和团的教育下，进步很快，曾被评为全市标兵，并出席过全省工业战线先进生产者代表大会。他虽然离开了农村，但是，他却经常关心着农业生产，特别是党中央提出发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针后，进一步提高了他对支援农业的觉悟，每当农忙季节来了后，他总是利用空闲和一切机会到农村去帮助社员修理机器、改良工具。今年3月底，当旱魔威胁着小麦生长的时候，他心里非常不安。一天，他向车间领导说：“当前农村抗旱很需要支援，让我去帮助修理排灌机械吧。”他的要求被批准了，他高兴得几乎跳起来。这天晚上，过了一点钟了他还没睡觉，在厂里的废料堆里去搜集排灌机械所需要的各种零件。他边找边唱，有说不清的高兴。他回想平时党委书记所说的话：“要支援农业，我们必须生产更多更好的农业机械。目前，农村生产技术还比较落后，需要我们利用一切机会，想尽一切办法去帮助他们。”现在，机会可来到了，他觉得浑身都是力量。
        忘我地劳动
    郜长华到农村后，同在厂里一样忘我地劳动着。在抗旱最紧张的时候，他总是到最艰苦的地区去。有一次，官庄小队社员们打了一眼六丈多深的机井，柴油机刚安好，没开几小时却突然坏了。郜长华知道这个消息后，冒着炎热天气赶到那里。社员们见他跑的满头大汗，要他赶快坐下来歇一歇。但是，他却马上检查起机器来了，不顾烈日的蒸晒，连续搞了几个小时，把柴油机修好。谁知机器只开了二小时，水又排不出来了。什么原因呢？他又经过细致检查，确定不是机器本身有毛病，需要下井检查。这时，太阳已偏西了，他因为好几天来的劳累，又困又乏，本想歇一歇。可是，他想，要不迅速修好，眼睁睁看着水排不出来，这怎样能战胜干旱。想到这里，他便拿起工具，带着保险绳下井了。井内温度低，井壁四周的水溅到身上冻得直发抖，郜长华也顾不得这些，只是细致地检查水泵有没有毛病。突然发现机器和水泵转速不符合，他认为这是关键问题，又上来同社员商量把机器皮带轮加大。他恐怕井下还会出问题，又第二次下到井下和社员们一起把管道吸水处挖了挖，把每节水管连接处法兰盘上的螺丝紧了紧，在井下坚持了两个多小时，直到排出水来他才上了井。
    郜长华在农村工作的几个月里，总是想着：“时间就是粮食”“有水就有粮”。因此，在遇到一些困难时，他总是千方百计地想办法解决。6月底，焦作地区旱象解除后，抗旱队伍都陆续回去了，可是他没回去。他抽出时间根据农村特点，改造机器。马防大队有一部煤气机，看机器的人嫌烧煤太麻烦，改为烧汽油，郜长华知道这个事情后，就和他到其他大队学习地下煤气炉经验，节约了大量汽油。
        苦心传授技术
    在农村的日子里，郜长华不只一次地看到一些有点小毛病的机器，因为没有人修理而闲置起来，也有一些机器因为人们操作不熟练而把机器搞坏，不能使这些机械充分发挥作用。因此，他下决心要把技术传授给农民，千方百计让他们学会使用机器和修理机器。大队和小队学开机器的社员，一般文化程度较低，又要求学得快。为了满足他们的要求，郜长华和他们同吃同住，白天在现场教他们操作，晚上回来上技术课，往往深夜还不休息。马防大队范水永逢人便说：“郜师傅费尽了心机，教会我用拿锄把的手摆弄洋机器。”范水永比其他学开机器的人年龄大一些，再加上从小没上过学，要在很短时间内，学会机器的拆卸技术确实有困难。在这种情况下，郜长华就不厌其烦地反复讲解，扳着手教。在郜长华的耐心帮助下，现在终于成为一个优秀司机。在短短的几个月中，他就采用了这些方法，使马村公社三十多个社员学会了使用和修理机器。
      在农村干一辈子
    在几个月的农村实际工作中，郜长华越来越感到农村迫切需要技术工人的支援。特别是每当抗旱紧张，排灌机械事故多，而自己又忙不过来将一些机器及时修好的时候，农民兄弟们总是站在机器跟前，焦急地说：“你一个人太累了，会修的人多几个就好了”，“这些机器早修好一天，我们就要多打好些粮食”，“郜师傅留在俺这里吧，你一走这些机器坏了该咋办”。在这种情况下，郜长华要求留在农村的决心越来越坚决。因此，他向厂领导申请，要求在农村干一辈子。这个要求使社员们感到高兴。但是，也有个别人想不通。厂里有些人当面问他：“有不少人想到城市去，而你却由城市往农村跑，这是为啥？”郜长华对他们说：“我啥也不为，就为了响应党和毛主席的号召，帮助农民弟兄进行社会主义建设，彻底改变农村的落后面貌，这是工人阶级的责任。”
    一天晚上，郜长华正在和大队干部研究秋播劳动力安排问题，突然接到了厂党委的一个通知。通知说：“郜长华同志，根据你的要求，党委决定批准你留在农村安家落户。”他顿时高兴得合不拢嘴。心想：我的愿望可实现了，今后一定要多想办法，为支援农业做出更大的成绩来，实现党交给自己的任务。开完会已是深夜，他还没有休息，坐在菜油灯下，琢磨着刚才大队党支部提出的想尽一切办法，腾出劳动力加速秋播的问题。突然，他想到有些小队磨粮食的磨都使用一、二头牲口和几个青壮年劳动力，如果用机器带动多好。
    第二天一清早，郜长华就找到那“睡大觉”的七马力煤气机。曾开过这台机器的司机张小五对他说：“没法治，别再费劲。”郜长华说：“现在很需要它，一定想办法让它动起来。”他边说边卷起袖子，开始大拆大洗，经过一天拆修、安装的复杂工作，这部煤气机还是动不起来。这时，天已黑了，社员们都回食堂吃饭去了，而他却又把张小五找来，终于摸清了这部机器的“个性”，修好了“活塞环”的零件，使这部长期睡大觉的机器复活了。于是，他又去找有技术的老农将石磨进行了改装。第三天下午，这盘用煤气机带动的石磨就发出了威力，它代替了五、六头牲口和二十多个劳动力，一天能磨二千多斤粮食，可以够全大队社员一天食用。把腾出的牲口、劳动力投入了秋播工作，使秋播每天进度比过去提高20％以上。大队支部书记赵宝成再次表扬了他。郜长华说：“我是公社的一员，今后需要做的工作还多得很哩！”
