Panjia Village Commune Operates Better and Better by Following Policies
    Thoroughly implement the three-level ownership system based on the team, the economic strength of both the commune and the team has rapidly developed, and poor teams have caught up with rich teams.
    Everywhere adhere to the principle of diligence and frugality in running the commune, saving manpower, materials, and financial resources; the canteen develops family-based production, and the masses' lives are well arranged.
    (People's Daily, Guiyang, November 14th) The cadres of Panjia Village People's Commune in Xingren County, Guizhou Province, resolutely implement the Party's various policies, and production has greatly developed, the lives of the masses are well arranged, and various tasks have been completed excellently. The entire commune presents a scene of prosperity. Now this commune has become a red flag for Xingren County and Anshun Prefecture.
    In implementing the Party's policies concerning rural people's communes, Panjia Village Commune first grasped the unified leadership and decentralized management, and conscientiously implemented the three-level ownership system based on the production team. In the spring and summer of last year, in order to further develop the economic strength of the production teams, the commune party committee helped each production team formulate plans for developing production, delegated some of the originally commune-run enterprises to the production teams, and assisted many production teams in establishing farm tool repair shops, lime factories (most of the land in this commune is acidic soil and needs lime to improve it), and indigenous fertilizer factories, etc.; at the same time, it clearly stipulated the necessary powers of the production teams in organizing production, capital construction, financial management, and establishing welfare undertakings. For the poor teams, in addition to using all the state subsidies for poor teams to support their development of production, the commune also strengthened its leadership over these teams, helping them catch up with the rich teams as soon as possible. Of the twenty-eight production teams in this commune, two were still poor teams last year, but this year they have all caught up with the rich teams.
    In order to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of all commune members and do a good job in the production of the production teams, the commune also, according to the Party's instructions, assisted the production teams in conscientiously implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" and "four fixings" in the contracted units—the production brigades. In implementing these methods, the commune adhered to the principle of democratic centralism and the principle of distribution according to work. For example, when the Longchang Production Team dealt with the issue of contracted production, it determined that each production brigade, on the one hand, should ensure the completion of the production plan proposed by the production team according to the unified plan of the commune, and on the other hand, fully mobilize the commune members to discuss the contracted production targets and arrange production deployments according to local conditions. The contracted production targets of each production brigade were first proposed by the production team for preliminary opinions, and the specific plans were formulated by the brigade members' representative meeting with reference to the land quality, labor force, and animal power of the brigade, and then discussed and approved by the brigade members' congress. The commune, management area, and production team never arbitrarily called up the labor force, land, animal power, and farm tools fixed for the production brigade to use in order to achieve the contracted production targets, and when the brigades organized cooperation, they also adhered to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange. Because the contracted production targets were fully discussed by the commune members and were guaranteed by fixed labor force, land, animal power, and farm tools, the enthusiasm of the production brigades to strive for "overproduction" was greatly mobilized. For example, of the five production brigades in the Longchang Production Team, three brigades received overproduction rewards last year, and two teams guaranteed production. The overproduction bonuses were immediately issued to the production brigades, and the brigades, in addition to retaining a small portion as public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, distributed most of them to the commune members according to the principle of more work, more pay. Last year, of the two hundred and sixty-one brigades in the entire commune, twenty-one brigades transferred labor to support other brigades during the autumn harvest, and the supported brigades paid remuneration according to the principle of equivalent exchange.
    After the implementation of the above methods, the production enthusiasm of the commune members was generally improved, and the production of the entire commune was further enlivened. Last year, the grain output of the entire commune had a large increase on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Livestock also developed rapidly, with pigs and cattle increasing by more than 40% and 8.9% respectively compared with 1958; poultry increased by 11%. After retaining sufficient rations, seeds, and fodder, the entire commune overfulfilled the state grain purchase task by 42%; the purchase tasks of live pigs and egg products were also completed ahead of schedule. This year, although encountering more than 100 days of drought, the total grain output is basically not inferior to last year, and the entire commune overfulfilled the state purchase task by 5.17% in late October. In the past two years, the economic strength of the commune and the production team has been further developed. Last year, the commune used the public accumulation funds turned in by each production team according to the proportion stipulated by the state to establish farm tool factories, paper mills, cattle farms, pig farms, and forest farms, etc., and also retained 800,000 jin of reserve grain; the team's economy, in addition to the funds invested in the production brigades, also had more than 1.2 million jin of reserve grain. More than 70% of the two hundred and sixty-one production brigades received overproduction rewards, and more than 90% of the commune members increased their income.
    The implementation of unified leadership, three-level ownership, and team-based operation also facilitates the commune in managing the lives of the commune members. The entire commune has established 251 canteens. Each production brigade has extracted 3% to 5% of the land handed over to them for fixed use as brigade vegetable gardens and fodder land to establish a canteen base; a portion is given to commune members as fodder land. Now, all canteens in the commune raise chickens and pigs, with the most raising dozens of each. All canteens ensure that commune members have enough vegetables to eat; the income from selling pigs and poultry to the state, in addition to buying oil and salt, also has a surplus, and most canteens have some cash deposits. In order to run the canteens well, all cadres in the commune eat with the commune members in the canteen, without exception. The party organization secretaries of the commune, management area, and production team have all run experimental canteens, accumulated experience, and guided the general. A canteen led by Jin Wencai, the secretary of the Longchang Management Area, often has more than 300 people eating, and only uses one administrator and four cooks, who are all party members, Youth League members, and poor and lower-middle peasant activists. The canteen not only has a solid family base in production, but also adheres to a democratic management system, regularly publishes accounts, and convenes members' representative meetings to solicit opinions. The vast majority of canteens in Panjia Village Commune are like this, with good production, democratic management, and well-arranged lives.
    With the development of production, the commune, production teams, and production brigades have a family base. How to grasp the principle of diligence and frugality in running the commune is a question that the Panjia Village Commune Party Committee often pays attention to. The commune party committee first grasped the rational use and conservation of labor in implementing diligence and frugality in running the commune. The commune-run factories, livestock farms, etc., only have more than 300 laborers participating in daily production, accounting for about 2.5% of the total labor force of the commune, and most of those who produce in cattle farms, pig farms, and forest farms are semi-laborers. The labor force participating in production in factories run by production teams all implement the method of working both in industry and agriculture: farming when it is busy with agriculture, and engaging in industrial production when it is slack. This year, the commune has transferred more than 1,000 young and middle-aged laborers from all aspects to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. Now, more than 70% of the labor force working on the front line of agriculture in the entire commune are young and middle-aged strong laborers. This provides good conditions for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.
    The commune also attaches great importance to the conservation of materials and financial resources. From the commune to the management areas and production teams, no offices have been built, and they all live in old houses in a simple and crude manner. The use of financial and material resources is strictly based on the principle of being conducive to the development of production and conducive to improving people's living conditions. Last year, the commune invested a part of the public accumulation funds in the construction of eight small reservoirs (the production team provided labor): the entire commune increased the irrigated area by more than 6,000 mu, and thirteen production teams benefited. At the same time, a part of the highway was built, and a part of the funds were subsidized to the people-run primary schools and nursing homes. This year, the autumn crops of several production teams were planted several times and suffered drought several times. The production team and the commune used a part of the reserve grain to support the production teams that were seriously affected by the drought and solve the problem of insufficient seeds.
    The Panjia Village Commune Party Organization attaches great importance to conducting policy education for cadres and publicizing policies to the masses, and attaches importance to cadres and commune members implementing the "four togethers." They do what the policy stipulates should be done, and resolutely listen to the Party's words. The work style of the cadres is also practical and meticulous, and they adhere to the principle of participating in production and leading production. Now each production team, management area, and commune-level cadre in the entire commune has purchased a set of equipment at their own expense, which is: hoe, sickle, back basket, pocket, and raincoat. Each cadre has a labor manual, and when they go down to work, they implement the "four togethers" with the commune members; in the office, they participate in the office production. The commune has inspections and registrations of cadres' participation in production, and regularly evaluates and publishes them as one of the important contents of cadre performance appraisal.

    每一个运动每一项工作都要坚决执行党的政策！
    潘家庄公社按政策办事越办越好
    全面贯彻以队为基础的三级所有制，社和队的经济力量都迅速发展，穷队赶上了富队
    处处坚持勤俭办社原则，节约人力物力财力；食堂发展家底生产，群众生活安排得好
    本报贵阳14日电　贵州省兴仁县潘家庄人民公社干部坚决贯彻党的各项政策，生产有了很大发展，群众生活安排得很好，出色地完成了各项任务，全社呈现一片兴旺景象。现在这个公社已经成为兴仁县和安顺专区的一面红旗。
    潘家庄公社在贯彻党的有关农村人民公社政策中，首先抓住了统一领导、分级管理，认真执行以生产队为基础的三级所有制。去年春夏，公社党委为了进一步发展生产队的经济力量，帮助各生产队制定了发展生产的计划，把原来社办的企业下放了一部分给生产队，协助许多生产队建立了农具修配厂、石灰厂（这个公社大部分土地是酸性土壤，需用石灰改良）和土化肥厂等；同时，明确规定了生产队在组织生产、基本建设、财务管理和兴办生活福利事业方面的必要权力。对于穷队，公社除了把国家补助穷队的贷款全部用于支援它们发展生产外，还加强了对这些队的领导，帮助它们尽快赶上富队。这个公社的二十八个生产队，去年还有二个穷队，今年都赶上了富队。
    为了充分调动全体社员的生产积极性，搞好生产队的生产，公社还根据党的指示，协助各生产队在包产单位——生产小队里，认真实行了“三包一奖”和“四固定”。在实行这些办法时，公社坚持了民主集中制，以及各尽所能、按劳分配的原则。例如，龙场生产队在处理包产问题时，确定了各生产小队一方面要保证完成生产队根据公社统一规划提出的生产计划，一方面充分发动社员群众讨论包产指标和因地制宜地安排生产部署。各生产小队的包产指标，都是先由生产队提出初步意见，由生产小队社员代表会参照本小队土地质量、劳力、畜力等条件拟定具体计划，然后经小队社员大会讨论通过。为实现包产指标而固定给生产小队使用的劳力、土地、畜力和农具，公社、管理区和生产队决不随便调用，小队与小队组织协作的时候，也坚持自愿两利、等价交换的原则。由于包产指标经过社员充分讨论，又有固定的劳力、土地、畜力和农具作保证，大大调动了生产小队力争“超产”的积极性。例如龙场生产队的五个生产小队，去年有三个小队得到超产奖励，两个队保产。超产奖金都即时发给了生产小队，小队除留少部分作为公积金和公益金外，大部分按多劳多得的原则，分给了社员。去年全社二百六十一个小队中，有二十一个小队在秋收时调出劳力支援过别的小队，被支援的小队都按等价交换原则付出了报酬。
    实行了以上一些办法后，社员的生产积极性普遍提高，全社生产进一步活跃起来。去年，全社粮食产量在1958年大跃进的基础上又有很大增长。牲畜也发展很快，猪和牛分别比1958年增长了40％以上和8.9％；家禽增加了11％。全社在留足口粮、种籽、饲料以后，超额42％完成了国家征购粮食的任务；生猪、蛋品的收购任务也提前完成。今年虽然遇到一百多天的干旱，但粮食总产量基本上不亚于去年，全社在10月下旬即超额5.17％完成了国家征购任务。两年来，社和生产队的经济力量都有了进一步的发展。去年，公社用各生产队按照国家规定的比例上缴的公积金，兴办了农具厂、纸厂和养牛场、养猪场、林场等，还留有八十万斤储备粮；队有经济除了向生产小队投资的资金外，还有一百二十几万斤储备粮。二百六十一个生产小队中，有70％以上的小队得到超产奖励，90％以上的社员增加了收入。
    实行了统一领导，三级所有、队为基础，也便于公社抓好社员生活。全社已建立起二百五十一个食堂。各生产小队在生产队交给固定使用的土地中，都抽出3％到5％的土地作为小队蔬菜地和饲料地，建立食堂家底；一部分给社员作饲料地。现在，全社食堂都养了鸡、猪，最多的各达数十只。各食堂都保证社员有足够的蔬菜吃；向国家出售猪、禽的收入所得，除了购买油盐外，还有节余，一般食堂都有一部分现金存款。为了把食堂办好，全社干部都在食堂和社员一起吃饭，无一例外。公社、管理区、生产队党组织书记，都办了试验食堂，积累经验，指导一般。龙场管理区书记金文才领导的一个食堂，经常有三百多人吃饭，只用一个事务长和四个炊事员，他们都是党、团员和贫农、下中农积极分子。食堂不但生产家底厚，还坚持了民主管理制度，定期公布账目，召开社员代表会征求意见。类似这样生产好、管理民主、生活安排好的食堂，在潘家庄公社占绝大多数。
    生产发展了，公社、生产队、生产小队有了家底，如何掌握勤俭办社的原则，是潘家庄公社党委经常注意的问题。公社党委在实行勤俭办社中首先抓住了合理使用和节约劳动力的问题。社办的工厂、畜牧场等，日常参加生产的只有三百多劳动力，占公社劳力总数的2.5％左右，而且在养牛场、养猪场和林场生产的多半是半劳力。生产队举办的工厂，参加生产的劳力都实行亦工亦农的办法：农忙务农，农闲搞工业生产。今年，公社又从各方面抽调了一千多青壮年劳动力加强了农业生产第一线。现在，全社在农业第一线劳动的劳动力，70％以上是青年和壮年强劳动力。这就为大办农业、大办粮食提供了良好的条件。
    对于物力、财力的节约，公社也很重视。从公社到各管理区、生产队没有兴建过一个办公室，都是因陋就简住在旧屋子里。财力、物力的使用都严格以有利于发展生产，有利于改善人民生活条件为原则。去年，公社以一部分公积金投资兴建了八个小型水库（生产队出劳力）：使全社增加灌溉面积六千多亩，十三个生产队受益。同时，兴修了一部分公路，给民办小学和敬老院补助了一部分经费。今年天旱，好几个生产队的秋庄稼都是几种几旱，生产队和公社就以一部分储备粮支援了受旱严重的生产队，解决种子不足问题。
    潘家庄公社党组织十分重视对干部进行政策教育和向群众宣传政策，重视干部和社员实行“四同”。政策规定应该怎样办，他们就怎样办，坚决听党的话。干部作风也踏实细致，坚持参加生产、领导生产的原则。现在全社生产队、管理区和社级干部，每个人都自费购置了一套装备，这就是：锄头、镰刀、背筐、口袋和蓑衣。每个干部都有一本劳动手册，到下面工作时就和社员实行“四同”；在机关里就参加机关生产。公社对干部参加生产的情况都有检查、登记，定期评比公布，作为干部考绩的重要内容之一。
