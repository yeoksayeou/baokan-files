The Spirit of the "Two-Five System" Radiates Splendor
Every Class Has Leadership, Resolutely Grasp to the End
Shenyang Factories Create New Leadership Methods
    Leadership cadres of factories and enterprises in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, have created many lively and new working methods based on the spirit of the "Two-Five System" leadership method. For example, Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang Smelter, Shenyang Gas Compressor Plant, Shenyang Water Pump Plant, etc., have formed factory-level leadership cadres, office professional cadres, and technical personnel into several "three-way combination" groups. They are assigned to major workshops and, together with the workshop cadres, delve into key teams, providing ideas and advice to workshop cadres and team managers according to their professional division of labor, and solving specific problems. Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant's approach is: every line has a commander, every path has soldiers, dividing forces to guard key points, and combining top and bottom. Shenyang Gas Compressor Plant adopts the method of "every class has leadership, truly grasping to the team, resolutely grasping to the end, and not withdrawing until success" to lead production. For example, at Shenyang Songling Machinery Plant, the plant director organized comrades from relevant technical and management departments to establish a "joint on-site office" in the workshop, located where problems are concentrated and contradictions are prominent, and moved to where there are weaknesses. Some Party committees hold meetings on-site.

    The improvement of leadership style and leadership methods has powerfully promoted production. In the past, the No. 2 workshop of Shenyang Water Pump Plant had low production efficiency, affecting the overall plant's production progress. The Party committee secretary, plant director, and management cadres of the departments formed a "three-way combination promotion team" to go deep into the workshop and participate in production. The next day, the production rate increased from the planned 98% to 110%, and after three days, it remained above 130%.

Winch Factory Leadership Cadres Go to the Front Line
Key Production Problems are Quickly Resolved
    After Tianjin Winch Factory implemented the "One-Two-Three System" leadership method of one day of study, two days of summarizing and researching work, and three days of going deep into the production front line, the factory's general Party branch secretary and plant director universally went deep into key workshops to "set up camp" and "settle down." They participated in production, inspected production, and directed production, so that various problems that appeared in production could be resolved more quickly. In the previous period, the factory's plan completion was affected because one of the main parts for external processing—cast steel gears—was not supplied. After the general Party branch secretary and plant director discovered this problem, they immediately took emergency measures, mobilized workers to collect old gears, and then had technicians and veteran workers appraise, repair, and select them for use, breaking through the key issue of gear supply and enabling the factory to overfulfill its plan.

Baotou Mining Bureau Strengthens the Mining and Excavation Front Line
    According to the spirit of on-site office work and the "Two-Five System", the Baotou Mining Bureau adopted the working methods of leadership cadres and functional department cadres taking responsibility for work faces and teams, strengthening the mining and excavation production front line, and promoting a substantial increase in coal production. Currently, more than 50% of the bureau's leadership cadres and 60% to 70% of the department cadres are fixed in their assigned work faces or teams, participating in production and leading production.

    The specific practice of taking responsibility for work faces and teams is: one or two departments take responsibility for one work face or one team, led by the Party committee responsible comrade or department leadership cadre, organizing all cadres of the department to take turns going down the well to participate in production. Under the unified leadership of the mine and department Party committees, they comprehensively grasp the work face's (team's) ideological mobilization, task completion, safe production, and worker life. Since early September, Changhangou Coal Mine has organized all cadres to take responsibility for work faces and teams, inserting department work directly to the end, carrying out work in four battle lines (mining and excavation, mechanical and electrical equipment maintenance, publicity and education, and life services), further strengthening grass-roots leadership and political and ideological work, and increasing coal production. The leadership cadres and department cadres of Zhaogou Coal Mine, led by members of the mine Party committee and responsible comrades of their departments, divided and cooperated to take responsibility for all mine mining and excavation work faces and production teams, taking turns working shifts and assisting various classes and teams in establishing political, administrative, safety, and trade union "leaders," achieving "everyone has something to do, everything is managed," and coal production has been continuously rising.

Yanglin Commune Cadres Actively Study Theory
    All cadres of Yanglin Commune in Anhua County, Hunan, are actively studying Volume Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

    After the cadres of Yanglin Commune implemented the "Two-Five System" leadership method, they persisted in cadres participating in production and leading production, and also persisted in cadres' theoretical study, closely combining production, work, and study into one rope. In the past six months, all 171 cadres who were detached from production or semi-detached from production have persisted in the system of centralized study for one day every seven days. Through the activities of the study day, the cadres' theoretical, policy, and ideological levels have been greatly improved. One hundred and ten of the one hundred and seventy-one cadres have written articles. In the past six months, the cadres of the whole commune have written more than 1,000 articles, greatly consolidating the results of their study. Because their studies have a foundation, they have been studying the fourth volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" very well since it was published.

Brigade Cadres Go Deep into Small Teams and Gain Good Experience
    How do brigade cadres go deep into small teams? How to persist in "four togethers"? After Xia Dongpu Brigade of Xiashan Commune in Chaoyang County, Guangdong, implemented the "Four-One System" working method, this problem was effectively solved.

    Xia Dongpu Brigade's "Four-One System" means that within five days, four days are spent going deep into small teams and working with commune members, and one day (divided into two afternoons) is spent holding meetings to study work or conduct production inspections and appraisals. The specific approach is to send the main cadres at the brigade level down to the production teams to strengthen the leadership of the small teams. The brigade's general Party branch has seven members. In addition to the general branch secretary grasping the overall situation and being responsible for the leadership of key small teams, the other six people are sent down to six small teams to serve as secretaries of the small team Party branches. The brigade also sent four Party member cadres to be responsible for the work of key canteens. Brigade cadres responsible for other department work, such as militia captains, League branch secretaries, women's directors, etc., are also assigned to various small teams to participate in production labor on the one hand, and do a good job in department work around production on the other hand. They are also allowed to spend three days a month specifically handling department work. In order to overcome and prevent the formalism or substitution that may arise after cadres go to the production team, the general Party branch also decided to fix the cadres in the production team and implement a contract system for the five aspects of work in the production team: production, life, education, implementation of policies, and completion of various tasks. At the same time, brigade cadres must serve as "advisers" to production team cadres and as learning tutors for production team cadres and commune members, helping them improve their political, cultural, and production technical levels. In addition, the general Party branch has also formulated a system of "fixed work attendance, fixed quota supplementary work, and appraisal and rewards" for cadres to ensure that brigade cadres participate in production and lead production.

    “二五制”精神光芒四射
    班班有领导　坚决抓到底
    沈阳各工厂创造新的领导方法
    辽宁省沈阳市各工厂企业领导干部，根据“二五制”领导方法的精神，创造了许多生动活泼的新的工作方法。如：沈阳机床三厂、沈阳机床一厂、沈阳冶炼厂、沈阳气体压缩机厂、沈阳水泵厂等，把厂一级的领导干部、科室专业干部和技术人员，组成若干“三结合”小组，分工到各主要车间，并和车间干部一起深入到重点小组，按照专业分工给车间干部和小组管理员出主意，当参谋，具体解决问题。沈阳机床三厂的作法是：条条有帅，路路有兵，分兵把口，上下结合。沈阳气体压缩机厂则采取“班班有领导，实抓到小组，坚决抓到底，不红不收兵”的方法领导生产。如沈阳松堎机器厂，由厂长组织各有关技术、管理科室的同志在车间成立了“现场联合办公室”，哪里问题集中、矛盾突出就设在哪里，哪里有薄弱环节就移到哪里。有的党委在开会的时候到现场去开。
    领导作风，领导方法的改进，有力地推动了生产。沈阳水泵厂二车间过去生产效率低，影响全厂生产进度。党委书记、厂长和科室的管理干部，组成三结合促进团，深入车间参加生产。第二天，生产率即由计划的百分之九十八上升到百分之一百一十，三天以后保持在百分之一百三十以上。
    卷扬机厂领导干部上前线
    生产关键问题迎刃而解
    天津市卷扬机厂实行了一天学习，两天总结研究工作，三天深入生产第一线的“一二三制”的领导方法以后，厂总支书记和厂长普遍深入重点车间“扎营”、“落户”，做到边参加生产，边检查生产，边指挥生产，使生产上出现的各种问题，更加迅速地得到解决。前一个时期，这个厂由于外加工的主要零件之一——铸钢牙轮供应不上，影响了计划的完成，党总支书记和厂长发现了这个问题，立即采取紧急措施，发动职工搜集旧牙轮，再由技术人员和老工人鉴定、修理、选择使用，突破了牙轮供应不上的关键，使生产超额完成了计划。
    包头矿务局加强采掘第一线
    包头矿务局根据井下办公和“二五制”的精神，采取领导干部和职能科室干部包工作面、包小组的工作方法，加强了采掘生产第一线，促进煤炭生产大幅度增长。目前，全局每天有百分之五十以上的领导干部和百分之六十到百分之七十的科室干部，固定在分工包干的工作面或小组里，参加生产，领导生产。
    包工作面、包小组的具体做法是：一个部门或两个部门包一个工作面或一个小组，由党委负责同志或科室领导干部挂帅，组织本部门的全体干部轮流下井参加生产。他们在矿、处党委的统一领导下，全面抓工作面（小组）的思想发动、完成任务、安全生产和职工生活等。长汉沟煤矿自九月上旬组织全体干部包工作面、包小组以来，科室工作一竿子插到底，分四条战线（采掘、机电设备维修、宣传教育、生活服务），结合本身业务开展工作，进一步加强了基层领导和政治思想工作，提高了煤炭产量。召沟煤矿的领导干部和科室干部，由矿党委委员和本部门负责同志挂帅，分工协作包干全矿采掘工作面、生产小组，轮流跟班劳动，协助各班、组建立了政治、行政、安全、工会等“组长”，作到了“人人有事干、事事有人管”，煤炭生产不断上升。
    杨林公社干部积极学理论
    湖南安化县杨林公社全社干部，正在积极学习“毛泽东选集”第四卷。
    杨林公社干部在推行“二五制”的领导方法以后，既坚持了干部参加生产领导生产，又坚持了干部理论学习，使生产、工作、学习紧密结合起来，拧成一股绳。全社一百七十一个脱离生产、半脱离生产的干部，半年来，一直坚持了每七天内集中学习一天的制度。通过学习日的活动，大大提高了干部的理论、政策和思想水平，一百七十一个干部有一百一十人写了文章，半年来全社干部共写文章一千多篇，大大巩固了学习成果。由于他们的学习有了基础，所以“毛泽东选集”第四卷出版以后，他们就学习得很好。
    大队干部深入小队有了好经验
    大队干部怎样深入小队？怎样坚持“四同”？广东潮阳县峡山公社夏东浦大队推行“四一制”工作方法以后，有效地解决了这个问题。
    夏东浦大队的“四一制”，即在五天之内，以四天时间深入小队，和社员一起劳动，以一天（分两个下午）时间开会研究工作，或者进行生产检查评比。具体做法是，把大队一级主要干部下放到生产小队，充实小队的领导力量。大队党总支有七个委员，除总支书记掌握全面和分工负责重点小队的领导工作以外，其他六人分别下放到六个小队，担任小队党支部书记。大队还派出四名党员干部负责重点食堂工作。负责其他部门工作的大队干部，如民兵队长、团总支书记、妇女主任等，也分派到各个小队去，一方面参加生产劳动，一方面围绕生产搞好部门工作，并且允许他们每月用三天时间专门处理部门工作。为了克服和防止干部下到生产队后可能产生的形式主义或包办代替的偏向，党总支又决定把干部固定在生产小队，对生产队的生产、生活、教育、贯彻政策、完成各项任务五方面工作实行包干制。同时，大队干部要当好生产小队干部的“参谋”，当好生产队干部和社员的学习辅导员，帮助他们提高政治、文化和生产技术水平。此外，党总支还制订了干部“定工出勤、定额补工、评比奖励”的制度，以保证大队干部做到参加生产领导生产。
