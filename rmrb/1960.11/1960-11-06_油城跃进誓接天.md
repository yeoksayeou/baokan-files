    Oil City Leap Forward Swears to Reach the Sky
    By Our Reporter Huang Yunbin

    Imperialists and their scholars once asserted: "China is fundamentally a country lacking oil." However, in the eleven years since liberation, the Yumen Oilfield has used ironclad facts to completely shatter the imperialists' fallacies. China is by no means a country poor in oil.

    In 1937, Chinese geologists discovered oil in Yumen. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government at that time neither marked the location nor had the strength to properly develop and utilize this rich resource. From 1939, when the first oil well was drilled using the percussion drilling method, until the time of liberation in 1949, for a full ten years, the Kuomintang reactionary government severely damaged this oilfield. After drilling the wells, they grabbed a little and left, allowing the oil wells to self-erupt, causing a series of blowouts and fires. Well No. 8 erupted for more than a year, with a maximum of more than 4,000 tons of crude oil gushing out every day; when Well No. 10 erupted, it reached 800 tons per hour, about more than 19,000 tons of crude oil per day, and the crude oil in the gullies flowed away like river water. This was not building an oilfield, but a criminal example of the Kuomintang reactionaries destroying the motherland's oil resources.

    After liberation, we picked up this mess and rebuilt it. Under the leadership of the Party, the construction work of the Yumen Oilfield developed rapidly. The people who came to the Yumen Oilfield understood: To realize national industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and national defense modernization, it is impossible without oil. "The motherland needs oil!" This is the task that the Party and the state have put forward to the Yumen Oilfield. It requires it to be built into China's first natural oil base at a high speed, requiring it not only to produce more oil as quickly as possible, but also to produce both more and better talent and experience to arm the national petroleum industry.

    The burden on the Yumen Oilfield is heavy, and there are many difficulties. The workers and staff building the Yumen Oilfield were not intimidated by the difficulties. Under the brilliant light of the General Line, they firmly grasped the key of "striving for high speed" and opened those "palaces" storing "black gold" – oil-bearing structures. Since 1953, the entire mine has set off a vigorous construction upsurge.

    At that time, all parts of the country extended a helping hand to Yumen. Equipment and materials poured into Yumen like a tide. Workers, farmers, herdsmen, demobilized soldiers, and students flocked to Yumen from all over the country. They believed that being able to participate in the construction of the motherland's first natural oil base was their greatest glory and happiness.

    "Striving for high speed" has become the action guide for everyone in the Yumen Oilfield. Geological exploration must be accelerated, drilling must be accelerated, oil extraction, refining, and construction must be accelerated, and learning must also be accelerated. They are working selflessly for high speed. The Yumen Oilfield has a nationally famous women's geological surveying team, whose members are mostly young women from the coastal areas of East China. Neither the severe cold nor heat, nor the wind and sand on the vast Gobi Desert, nor the attacks of blizzards in the depth of winter, have prevented them from working. Once, a selection team led by He Binbin went to the desert. Because they wanted to do more work, they did not return to the tent in time. It was dark, the wind picked up, and the weather suddenly turned cold. They were wearing few clothes, so they had to dig pits in the ground and hide half of their bodies in the sandpits to keep warm. After a while, the sandpits cooled down, so they dug new ones, and persevered until dawn. Once, the 101st Geological Survey Team went to Mazong Mountain for a general survey. From the beginning of May to the end of August, in an area of ​​more than 10,000 square kilometers, they did not encounter a single person. The climate in the mountains is unpredictable. It is very hot during the day, and the soles of the feet get hot when walking in sneakers. But in order to save time, they still persisted in working under the scorching sun. When asked if their work was hard, they always replied with a smile: "When we think that on the road we have traveled, there will be oil drilling towers like jungles, we will become more and more energetic!"

    As long as oil can be found, they will not hesitate to go through fire and water. In the Yumen Oilfield, it is not dozens or hundreds of people who have this ambition and courage, but thousands upon thousands of people. That was still at the beginning of 1956. Based on the fact that a small number of herdsmen carried rock salt from the Shule Basin in the Qilian Mountains containing the smell of petroleum gas, the Yumen Oilfield decided to send a geological team to explore it. When the exploration team members learned of this news, many people rushed to go. Finally, six strong young men were selected, and they carried tents and various daily necessities on yaks and set off for the Shule Basin. They suffered several blizzards on the way, but they did not shrink back in the face of difficulties. They traveled for more than half a month, crossed the Tuolai Basin, crossed seven high mountains with an altitude of more than 4,000 to 5,000 meters with thin air and perennial snow, and many glaciers, and finally entered the Shule Basin and obtained the required geological data.

    It is these ordinary people who, regardless of all dangers and hardships, are eager day and night to find new oilfields as quickly as possible. Over the past eleven years, they have crossed the vast Gobi Desert, climbed the Qilian Mountains, Mazong Mountains, Helan Mountains, Flaming Mountains, crossed deserts, crossed glaciers and snow-capped mountains with an altitude of four or five thousand meters, and deeply imprinted their footprints in the Tuolai Basin, Jiuquan Basin, Shule Basin, Mincong Basin, and Turpan Basin. In those remote mountains and fields, where people rarely set foot, they planted red flags and markers. Today, in many places they have traveled, the rumbling of drilling has already sounded, and the names of many new oilfields have been marked.

    In order to drill more footage, drill more wells, and produce more oil, the workers tenaciously studied and quickly mastered new technologies such as rapid drilling and turbine drilling. Demobilized soldier Yao Fulin reached the technical level of driller in six months. Before liberation, it took at least eight to nine years to train a driller. It is rare in some developed countries of the petroleum industry to master the technology in such a short period of time. Following Yao Fulin, countless Yao Fulins appeared. They increased the drilling speed several times to dozens of times compared to the past. Before liberation, it took a drilling team several months to drill a well of dozens of meters, but now a drilling team can drill more than 200 to 600 meters in one day. In 1958, the drilling footage of Wang Jinxi's drilling team was more than 2,000 meters more than the total drilling footage of the Yumen Oilfield in the ten years before liberation.

    After the Yumen Oilfield firmly grasped the construction key of "high speed", it rapidly grew and expanded. As early as 1957, it had been built into an oil base. Workers and staff have mastered a series of advanced petroleum geological exploration, oil extraction, refining, and drilling technologies. The Yumen Oilfield is no longer just producing oil from the Laojunmiao Oilfield. Some new oilfields have been found around it and are being actively developed for oil production.

    The Yumen Oilfield not only pays attention to its own development and expansion, but also trains reserve forces for the national petroleum industry at a high speed under the guidance of the idea of ​​"the whole country as one chessboard." They deeply understand: To build socialism throughout the country, one Yumen is not enough, there should be several or dozens of Yumens. In these eleven years, the Yumen Oilfield has transferred tens of thousands of workers, engineers, technicians and enterprise management cadres to support the needs of the development of the national petroleum industry. After the Karamay oil gushed out, the Yumen Oilfield immediately transferred a complete set of technical teams from geological exploration to drilling, well testing, oil extraction, oilfield construction, and transportation to meet the needs of the rapid construction of the Karamay Oilfield. After a new oil area in Sichuan sprayed oil, the Yumen Oilfield transferred dozens of drilling teams. In Qaidam, Lanzhou and other places, there are people transferred from Yumen.

    Now, the national petroleum industry is striding forward, and this major achievement is inseparable from the construction achievements of the Yumen Oilfield.

    Yumen, this oil city has become more prosperous and magnificent in the past eleven years. The population of Yumen City was only more than 4,000 in 1949, and now it has reached tens of thousands. At night, when you drive out of the end of the ancient Great Wall – Jiayuguan, and continue to drive westward across a vast Gobi Desert, you will see thousands of electric lights flashing in the sky, decorating the Gobi Desert with brilliant brilliance. Who would have thought that eleven years ago, this was still a desolate and lonely Gobi Desert with sparse lights and wild wolves? The lights reflected the night sky red, as if the flame of building socialism that burst out from the hearts of thousands of heroes in the oil city was burning. It is this fire that lights up the Gobi Desert shrouded in the dark night, allowing Yumen, this treasure land, to emit a dazzling golden light. (Attached picture)

    油城跃进誓接天
    本报记者　黄云滨
    帝国主义和它的学者们，曾经断言过：“中国是一个根本缺石油的国家”。但是玉门油矿在解放后十一年内，用铁一般的事实，彻底粉碎了帝国主义者的谰言。中国绝不是个贫油的国家。
    1937年，我国的地质学家，在玉门发现了石油。但是那时国民党反动政府没有打标也没有力量很好地开发和利用这一丰富资源。从1939年用顿钻方法钻成第一口油井开始采油起，到1949年解放时止，整整十年，国民党反动政府严重地破坏了这座油矿。他们钻了井以后，抓上一点就走，任油井自喷，造成一连串的井喷和火灾事故。八号油井整整喷了一年多，最多的时候，每天要喷出四千多吨原油；十号油井井喷时，每小时达到八百吨，一天约喷出一万九千多吨原油，山沟里的原油像河水一样流走了。这不是建设油矿，这是国民党反动派破坏祖国石油资源的罪恶例证。
    解放以后，我们拾起这个烂摊子，重新建设。在党的领导下，玉门油矿的建设工作迅速发展。来到玉门油矿的人们懂得：要实现国家工业化、农业机械化和国防现代化，没有石油是不行的。“祖国需要石油！”这就是党和国家向玉门油矿提出的任务。要求它必须高速度地建成为我国第一个天然石油基地，要求它不但能尽快地多产石油，还要又多又好地出人材、出经验，去武装全国石油工业。
    玉门油矿肩负的担子是沉重的，困难是很多的。建设玉门油矿的职工，没有被困难吓倒，他们在总路线的光辉照耀下，紧紧握着“力争高速度”这把钥匙，打开了那些储藏着“黑色金子的宫殿”——储油构造。从1953年开始，全矿掀起了蓬勃的建设高潮。
    那时，全国各地向玉门伸出了支援的手。器材、设备像潮水一样涌向玉门。工人、农民、牧民、复员军人、学生纷纷从全国各地奔向玉门，他们认为：能够参加祖国第一个天然石油基地的建设，是自己的莫大光荣和幸福。
    “力争高速度”，成了玉门油矿每一个人的行动指南。进行地质勘探时要提高速度，钻井时要提高速度，采油、炼油、建设要提高速度，学习也要提高速度。他们为了高速度而忘我地劳动着。玉门油矿有一个全国闻名的女子地质测量队，队员大多是从华东沿海地区来的年轻姑娘。不管严寒酷热，不管大戈壁上的风沙和隆冬暴风雪的袭击，都没有阻止过她们工作。有一次，何彬彬领导的一个选线组到沙漠里去，因想多做一点工作，没有及时收工返回帐篷。天黑了，刮起了大风，气候突然变冷，她们穿的衣服又少，只好在地上挖坑，把半个身子藏在沙窝里取暖，过了一会，沙窝凉了就再挖新的，这样一直坚持到天亮。有一次，一零一地质普查队到马鬃山内去作普查。从5月初进山到8月底的几个月时间里，在一万多平方公里的地区内，没有遇见过一个人。山里气候变化无常，白天非常热，穿着球鞋走路脚底都发烫。但他们为了争取时间，仍然在烈日下面坚持工作。当问到他们工作艰苦不艰苦时，他们总是笑嘻嘻地回答：“当我们想到我们走过的路上，将会出现像丛林一样的石油钻塔时，我们就越干越有劲了！”
    只要能找到油，虽赴汤蹈火在所不辞，在玉门油矿不是几十人、几百人有这种雄心和气魄，而是成千上万的人。那还是1956年年初的事。根据少数牧民从祁连山疏勒盆地内驮出的岩盐中含有石油气味的事实，玉门油矿决定派一支地质队去探一下。这个消息让勘探队员们知道了，许多人都争着要去。最后挑了六个身体强壮的小伙子，用牦牛驮着帐篷和各种生活日用品向疏勒盆地出发。途中遭受了数次暴风雪的袭击，但他们没有在困难面前退缩，行走了半个多月，穿过托赖盆地，翻过七个海拔高达四千多米到五千米空气稀薄、常年积雪的高山和许多冰川以后，终于进入疏勒盆地，取得了需要的地质资料。
    就是这些平凡的人，不避一切艰险和困苦，日夜渴望的是如何能加快速度找到新的油田。十一年来，他们越过茫茫的大戈壁，爬过祁连山、马鬃山、合黎山、火焰山，穿过沙漠，翻过冰川和海拔四五千米的雪山，在托赖盆地、酒泉盆地、疏勒盆地、民璁盆地、吐鲁番盆地，深深印下了他们的足迹。在那些荒山僻野、人迹罕到的地方，插上了红旗和标桩。如今，在他们走过的许多地方，已经响起了隆隆的钻探声，已经标上了许多新油田的名字。
    工人们为了多打进尺，多钻井，多产石油，都顽强地学习，迅速掌握了快速钻井、涡轮钻井新技术。复员军人姚福林，在六个月内就达到了司钻的技术水平。解放以前，培养一个司钻至少需用八年到九年的时间。在这样短的时间里就掌握了技术，在一些石油工业发达的国家内也是少见的。继姚福林之后，无数个姚福林出现了。他们把钻井速度，比过去提高了几倍到几十倍。解放以前，一个钻井队钻一口几十米的井，需要几个月的时间，而现在一个钻井队在一天内，就可钻二百多米到六百多米。王进喜钻井队在1958年一年内的钻井进尺，比玉门油矿解放前十年内钻井进尺的总和还多两千多米。
    玉门油矿紧紧抓住“高速度”这把建设钥匙以后，它迅速地成长壮大起来。早在1957年它就已建成为一个石油基地。职工们已掌握了一系列先进的石油地质勘探、采油、炼油、钻井技术。玉门油矿再不是只有一个老君庙油田产油了，在它的周围，又找到了一些新的油田，正在积极开发出油。
    玉门油矿不仅注意自身的发展和壮大，而且在“全国一盘棋”思想的指导下，高速度地为全国石油工业培训后备力量。他们深深懂得：要在全国建设社会主义，只有一个玉门是不够的，应该有几个、几十个玉门。在这十一年内，玉门油矿调出了成千上万的工人、工程技术人员和企业管理干部，支援了全国石油工业发展的需要。克拉玛依喷油以后，玉门油矿立即调去了从地质勘探到钻井、试油、采油、油田建设、运输一整套技术队伍，适应了克拉玛依油田迅速建设的需要。四川一个新油区喷油以后，玉门油矿调去了几十个钻井队。在柴达木、在兰州等地，都有玉门调去的人。
    现在，全国的石油工业正在大步迈进，而这个重大成就是和玉门油矿的建设成就分不开的。
    玉门，这座石油城十一年来变得更加繁华和壮丽。玉门市人口在1949年只有四千多人，现在已达几万人。夜晚，当你驱车驰出古老长城的终点——嘉峪关，越过一片茫茫戈壁向西继续奔驰时，就会看见千万盏电灯光在天际闪烁，把戈壁滩点缀得灿烂辉煌。谁能想到十一年以前，这里还是一片灯火稀疏、野狼出没、荒凉寂寞的戈壁滩呢？灯光映红了夜空，好像从石油城里成千上万个英雄们心中迸发出的那团建设社会主义的火焰在燃烧。正是这团火，把沉沉黑夜笼罩着的戈壁滩燃亮，让玉门这块宝地发射出耀眼的金光。（附图片）
