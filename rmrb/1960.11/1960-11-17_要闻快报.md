	Longshan Commune Appropriately Places Returned Educated Youth
	Since September, 620 educated youths in Longshan Commune, Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province, have returned to their hometown to participate in production. In order to give full play to their talents, the Commune Party Committee arranged suitable labor and work for them according to their age, physical strength, and expertise. Generally, men are assigned to the front line of agriculture to participate in production, while those with weaker physical strength or women are assigned to work in logistics departments such as canteens, livestock farms, and nurseries.

	The Commune Party Committee also strengthens their political training. The Tangxi Brigade Party Branch specially incorporated active members from these young students into spare-time Party schools and Communist Youth League schools for study, and organized six Mao Zedong Thought study groups with the Communist Youth League branch as the core in production teams. The branch secretary and cadres stationed in the teams regularly gave them guidance reports.

	Zhongning Cadres Establish "Public Canteen Experimental Plots"
	In order to improve the canteens, the CCP Zhongning County Committee and the commune Party committees in Ningxia, under the personal leadership of the county party secretary, have been vigorously developing "public canteen experimental plots" throughout the county. The specific approach is: from the first secretary of the county party committee to the production team cadres, no matter where they work or labor, they must be with the commune members, eat in the canteen, live in the canteen, and run the canteen; all canteens in county-level agencies and schools are merged with the canteens of various production teams, which are both agency canteens, commune member canteens, and "experimental plots" jointly operated by cadres and commune members, contracting to the end to ensure successful operation.

	Factory Party Committee Grasps Production and Life Simultaneously
	While focusing on production, the Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Factory Party Committee also tightened the supply of grain, vegetables, coal, firewood, etc., so that employees have sufficient energy to concentrate on production and work. In order to ensure that employees eat well, eat enough, and eat hygienically, the factory strengthened the management of canteens, summarized good experiences in saving grain, and held on-site meetings in a timely manner to organize promotion.

	Financial and Trade Departments Implement Stationed Team Work System
	The financial and trade departments of Lingbao County, 崤函镇 Commune, Henan Province, implemented a "four-two-one" stationed team work system to further strengthen support for agricultural production and also strengthen purchasing work. The "four-two-one" stationed team work system means that cadres from the financial and trade departments spend four days stationed in the team, two days reporting and researching work, and one day studying. While stationed in the team, they participate in brigade work, are able to promptly understand production needs and promptly supply various commodities. For example, during this year's "Three Autumns" production, a total of 38,500 pieces of agricultural tools were needed. In addition to the agricultural tools made and repaired by the teams themselves, the stationed financial and trade cadres promptly supplied 30,000 pieces of agricultural tools, adapting to the needs of production.

	Financial and Trade Cadres and Commune Members Implement "Four Togethernesses"
	In order to make commercial work serve agricultural production more promptly, the financial and trade cadres in Duyun City, Guizhou Province, have promoted a stationed team system. At present, 68% of the city's production teams have financial and trade cadres stationed in them, and more than 50 financial and trade cadres also serve as deputy secretaries of production team branches, deputy captains, or deputy directors of canteens.

	After settling down in the production teams, these financial and trade cadres adhere to eating together, living together, laboring together, and discussing together with the commune members, spending 80% of their time and energy participating in labor and assisting team leaders in doing a good job in production, while also carrying out procurement and supply work.
