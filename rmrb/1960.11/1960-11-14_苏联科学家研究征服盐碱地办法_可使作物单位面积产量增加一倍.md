    Soviet Scientists Research Methods to Conquer Saline-Alkali Land
    Can Double Crop Yield per Unit Area
    Soviet scientist Henkel has researched a method that can increase the salt tolerance of crops to certain types of salts by several times. Using this method, the yield per unit area of millet, cotton, and sunflowers planted in saline-alkali land increased by one time compared to those not using this method.
    His method mainly involves soaking seeds in a diluted solution of manganese sulfate before sowing them into the soil. After this treatment, the plants develop salt resistance from the very first days of development, the amount of salt entering the plants from the soil decreases, and the scope of the harmful effects of salt is greatly reduced.
    There are three types of saline-alkali soil. Henkel has already researched methods to increase the salt resistance of crops on two of these types of soil and is currently researching methods to increase salt resistance on the third type of soil.

    苏联科学家研究征服盐碱地办法
    可使作物单位面积产量增加一倍
    苏联科学家根克尔研究出一种方法，可以使农作物对某几种盐类的耐力提高几倍。采用这种方法在盐碱地种植的黍、棉和向日葵的单位面积产量比未用此法的增加了一倍。
    他的方法主要就是：在种子播入土壤之前，用硫酸锰稀溶液浸种。经过这样处理以后，植物从开始发育的头几天起就产生了抗盐力，由土壤进入植物的盐类数量就减少了，盐的危害作用范围也大大缩小了。
    盐碱土一共有三个类型。根克尔已经研究出了提高农作物在其中两种类型土壤上的抗盐碱力的方法，目前正在研究在第三类土壤上提高抗盐碱力的方法。
