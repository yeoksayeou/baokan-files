(Reported by our newspaper) Commercial departments in various regions, while doing a good job in purchasing agricultural products, are actively organizing the supply of industrial products to the countryside to meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers for daily-use industrial products after selling their agricultural products.

Commercial departments in various regions dispatched personnel to the countryside for investigation as early as the second and third quarters, and actively organized sources of goods based on this. Therefore, this year, the time for industrial products to go to the countryside in many regions has been advanced by one month compared to previous years, and the quantity and variety of goods transferred to rural areas have increased significantly. By the end of the third quarter, Jiangsu Province had already distributed 15.77 million yuan of goods to the countryside that were to be supplied in the fourth quarter, accounting for 27% of the fourth quarter supply plan. Heilongjiang Province has currently distributed more than 34 million yuan of goods, an increase of 45% over the same period last year. In Shaanxi Province, the total value of department store goods distributed to the countryside in the third quarter was 14,076,600 yuan, an increase of 32.5% over the same period last year. The goods distributed by Hunan Province at the end of the third quarter increased by 12.4% over the same period last year. Cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing have also transferred a large number of daily-use industrial products to rural areas. To meet the growing needs of farmers' living standards, the Nantong City Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station in Jiangsu Province has added 39 new varieties of industrial products to its supply to rural areas this year, including elastic bands, zipper shirts, and kerosene lamp shades. Wuxi City has also increased the number of goods distributed this year by more than 420 varieties, including cotton clothes and children's clothing.

This year, in organizing the supply of industrial products to rural areas in winter, commercial departments in various regions have paid special attention to promoting the development of local industries, striving to achieve local production and local supply as much as possible. When organizing local industrial production, the commercial department of Xining City, Qinghai Province, adopted the measures of "three grasps" (grasping large and small factories together, grasping both indigenous and foreign production together, and grasping both large and small products together), "two guarantees" (guaranteeing sales of whatever is produced, and guaranteeing sales of however much is produced), and "one support" (supporting raw materials), supplying more than 140 kinds of raw materials to various factories. This has enabled the commercial departments to purchase small hardware and small commodities that they used to purchase from other places, such as drills, paper clips, scarves, skin moisturizers, and batteries, from local factories. The Qiqihar City Department Store Supply Station in Heilongjiang Province, due to helping local industries and light chemical industries develop production, purchased more than 3 million yuan of local products in September alone, accounting for about 30% of sales. Commercial departments in many regions have also conducted inventory checks and organized small-scale materials exchange meetings, which have played a role in increasing the supply of goods and ensuring the supply of the market during the rural peak season.

In order to quickly distribute goods to the front line of the countryside, commercial departments in various regions have also actively cooperated closely with railway and transportation departments to seize the transportation work. Commercial storage and transportation departments in various regions have adopted the methods of priority warehousing, priority loading, and priority dispatch for goods distributed to rural areas. The Shanghai Municipal Commercial Department and the Railway Department jointly established a temporary team, went deep into the purchasing and supply stations, warehouses, and stations, communicated information in a timely manner, and helped organize the allocation of goods and vehicles, which resulted in the early shipment of goods originally scheduled for supply in the fourth quarter in mid-September. In order to quickly send cold-proof materials to the countryside, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Hebei and other places adopted the methods of "direct line transportation from factories" and concentrated organizational efforts to carry out assault transportation, reduced the circulation links of goods, and greatly accelerated the transportation speed.

    供应广大农民出售农产品以后的需要
    商业部门组织工业品源源下乡
    调拨时间比去年提早，商品数量和品种显著增加
    本报讯　各地商业部门在做好农产品收购工作的同时，积极组织工业品下乡，供应广大农民在出售农产品之后对日用工业品的需要。
    各地商业部门早在第二、三季度就陆续派人下乡作了调查，据此积极组织货源。因此，今年许多地区工业品下乡的时间比往年提早了一个月，而且调往农村的商品数量和品种都有显著增加。江苏省到第三季度末，已经提前把要在第四季度供应的一千五百七十七万元商品下放到农村，占第四季度供应计划的27％。黑龙江省目前已经下放的商品共达三千四百多万元，比去年同期增加45％。陕西省三季度下放到农村的百货类商品共一千四百零七万六千元，比去年同期增长32.5％。湖南省三季度末下放的商品比去年同期增长12.4％。上海、天津、北京等城市也已经把大批日用工业品调往各地农村。适应农民生活水平日益提高的需要，江苏省南通市百货采购供应站，今年供应农村的工业品中，增加了宽紧带、拉链衫、煤油灯罩等三十九项新品种。无锡市今年下放的商品也增加了棉衣、儿童服装等四百二十多种。
    各地商业部门今年在组织冬季农村工业品的货源中，特别注意促进地方工业的发展，尽可能做到就地生产、就地供应。青海省西宁市商业部门在组织地方工业生产时，采取“三抓”（大小工厂一起抓、土洋生产一起抓、大小产品一起抓）、“二包”（生产什么包销什么，生产多少包销多少）、“一支援”（支援原料）的措施，供应各工厂一百四十多种原料，使商业部门过去要从外地采购的小五金、小百货，如钻子、纸夹、围巾、润肤油、电池等，现在都能从当地工厂收购。黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市百货供应站由于帮助地方工业、轻化工业发展生产，仅9月份就收购了三百多万元地方产品，占销货额的30％左右。不少地区商业部门还进行了清仓排队，举办小型物资交流会，对于增加货源，保证农村旺季市场供应都起了一定的作用。
    为了迅速地把商品下放到农村第一线去，各地商业部门还主动地同铁路、交通运输部门密切配合，抓紧调运工作。各地商业储运部门对下放农村商品采取了优先出库、优先装车、优先发运的办法。上海市商业部门同铁路部门共同成立临时小组，深入采购供应站、仓库、车站，及时沟通情况，帮助组织调配货源和车辆，结果使原定第四季度供应的商品在9月中旬就提前启运。陕西、江苏、河北等地为把防寒物资赶快送往农村，采用了“就厂直线运输”和集中组织力量突击运输的办法，减少商品流转环节，大大加快了调运速度。
