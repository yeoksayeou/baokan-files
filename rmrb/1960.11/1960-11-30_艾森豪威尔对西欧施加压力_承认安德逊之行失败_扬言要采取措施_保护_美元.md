Xinhua News Agency, November 29th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower issued a statement on the 28th regarding Anderson and Dillon's trip to Western Europe, on the one hand admitting that his two special envoys to resolve the U.S. international payment crisis had achieved no concrete results, and on the other hand continuing to put pressure on allies unwilling to contribute money.

In his statement, Eisenhower, referring to the results of the talks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Under Secretary of State Dillon in West Germany, said that although both sides, at the request of the United States, "discussed the issue of sharing part of the costs of the U.S. troops stationed in West Germany in some way, no agreement was reached."

The statement said that the U.S. and West Germany agreed that both sides "will continue negotiations in Bonn and Washington" to discuss "other issues aimed at improving the U.S. balance of payments situation." However, according to White House Press Secretary Hagerty after Eisenhower's statement was issued, because West Germany was "not prepared to discuss" the issue of the U.S. wanting West Germany to increase payments for U.S. occupation troops, the U.S. would not be able to insist on discussing this issue again in future negotiations.

Eisenhower's statement said that the issues to be negotiated between the U.S. and West Germany in the future include West Germany "expanding (its) purchases (from the U.S.) of military supplies for its own troops and considering purchasing military supplies that could be supplied to other NATO countries," and "removing (West Germany's) still-existing import restrictions on U.S. agricultural products," etc.

Eisenhower's statement, in order to conceal the fact that Anderson and Dillon's negotiations in London and Paris were equally fruitless, said that the U.S. and these two countries only "informally exchanged views on issues of mutual concern, particularly the world financial system."

Eisenhower emphasized in his statement that the U.S. must "maintain the dollar." He was clearly addressing Western European allies unwilling to contribute money to help the U.S., saying that the U.S. "is determined to take" "the decisions necessary to protect the integrity of the dollar."

    承认安德逊之行失败　扬言要采取措施“保护”美元
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔28日就安德逊和狄龙的西欧之行发表声明，一方面承认他的这两个解救美国国际支付危机的特使毫无具体收获，另方面又继续对不愿出钱的盟国施加压力。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中谈到美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙在西德的会谈结果时说，双方虽然在美国要求下“讨论了以某种方式来分担美国驻在西德的军队一部分费用问题，但是没有取得协议”。
    声明说，美国同西德协议双方“将继续在波恩和华盛顿进行谈判”，以讨论“目的在导致改进美国国际收支情况的其他一些问题”。但是，据白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在艾森豪威尔声明发表后说，由于西德“不准备讨论”美国要西德增加支付美国占领军费用问题，美国将不可能坚持在以后的谈判中再讨论这个问题。
    艾森豪威尔的声明中说，美国和西德之间以后要谈判的问题包括西德“扩大（向美国）购买供应自己军队的军用品、并考虑购买可能供应北大西洋公约联盟其他国家的军用品”，和“取消（西德）仍旧存在的对美国农产品的进口限制”等。
    艾森豪威尔的声明为了掩饰安德逊和狄龙在伦敦和巴黎的谈判同样毫无结果，说美国和这两个国家仅“就相互有关问题、特别是世界金融制度非正式地交换了意见”。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中强调美国要“维护美元”。他显然是针对不愿出钱帮助美国的西欧盟国说，美国“决心要采取”“为保护美元的完整所必要的决定”。
