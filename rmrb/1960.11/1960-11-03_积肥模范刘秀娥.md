    Model Fertilizer Accumulator Liu Xiu'e
    In our Taoyuan Production Team of Fengzhou Commune, there is a female commune member who is often seen carrying a basket to collect manure, whether it is morning, noon, or evening. Her name is Liu Xiu'e, and she is a "Five-Good" commune member and an active fertilizer accumulator in our commune.
    Since Liu Xiu'e took on the role of fertilizer accumulator for the production team, she has never stopped her fertilizer accumulation work, regardless of the scorching sun or wind and rain. Our commune raises a lot of cattle, and Xiu'e has carefully figured out the pattern of cattle excreting manure. Therefore, she always collects one-third more manure than others every day. From January to August this year, she alone accumulated 549 dan of cow and pig manure.

    积肥模范刘秀娥
    在我们丰州公社的桃源生产队里，不论是早晨、中午或傍晚，经常有一个女社员背着筐子拾粪，她的名字叫刘秀娥，是我们公社的“五好”社员和积肥积极分子。
    刘秀娥担任生产队的积肥员以后，不论是烈日当头或是刮风下雨，她从来不间断积肥工作。我们公社养牛很多，秀娥细心地找到了牛排泄粪便的规律，因此，每天拾的粪总比别人多三分之一以上，今年一月到八月，她一个人就积了牛猪粪肥五百四十九担。
