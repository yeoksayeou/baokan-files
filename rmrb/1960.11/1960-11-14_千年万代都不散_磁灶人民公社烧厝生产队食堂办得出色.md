　　Will Not Disperse for Thousands of Generations
    ——The Cizao People's Commune Shao厝 Production Team's Mess Hall is Exceptionally Well-Run
    中共晋江县委会 (The Chinese Communist Party Jinjiang County Committee)
    Editor's Note: The experience of the Shao厝 Production Team's public mess hall illustrates that the decisive factors in running a good mess hall lie in having good leading cadres and good mess hall staff. With a backbone force like Lai Yong and others, this mess hall can implement the Party's leadership, ensuring the correct implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies. Their greatest characteristic is having a high degree of class consciousness and mass viewpoint, with full revolutionary enthusiasm and a spirit of practical hard work. This is worth learning carefully by everyone.
    Production and life are two aspects of the same thing, a dialectical unity. Only by doing a good job in production can we have a material foundation and reliable guarantee for a good life; only by doing a good job in life can the masses have a full spirit and soaring energy, so that production can achieve sustained leaps forward. Running the mess hall well is a major event, and the Party committees in various places must grasp life as a major political task, grasping it tightly and to the end.

    The mess hall of the Shao厝 Production Team of the Cizao Commune in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, is very well-run, exceptionally so, and famous far and wide. All six hundred and seventeen people in this team participated in the mess hall. Because the mess hall was well-run, and other work was also done well, agricultural production has achieved good harvests for several years in a row, throwing off the hat of a grain-deficient team and becoming a surplus grain team.

    Secretary Runs Mess Hall, Politics Enters the Kitchen

    Strengthening the Party's leadership and sending caring, considerate, fair, and capable Party members and cadres to the mess hall is the key to running a good mess hall. Comrade Lai Yong and others, who came from a poor peasant background, are such cadres. Comrade Lai Yong is the deputy secretary of the production team's Party branch. In order to run the mess hall well, he personally served as the mess hall director and even lived in the kitchen. He led the cooks in revising management systems, improving operations and management, implementing planned grain use, establishing a non-staple food base, improving cooking tools, building a dining hall diligently and thriftily, and organizing cooks to carry out competitions and evaluations. In short, he managed almost everything, big and small, in the kitchen.

    Comrade Lai Yong saw that the cooks were hot and smoked while tending the stove in the summer; another cook had to carry water from a distant place, and carrying water all day long could not even meet the demand. He discussed with the mason Lai Yongshu to change the stove from the old-fashioned single-pot stove to a new-style three-row stove, and to move the stove opening from indoors to outdoors, reducing the number of people burning the fire from eight to three. He also discussed with the cooks to dig a deep well in the courtyard of the mess hall, using a hoisting pole to lift water, allowing the water to flow into the pot by itself, greatly reducing the workload of the cooks. This spring, he learned from foreign experience and made a hand-cranked bamboo tube water pump. Now, for the water used by more than 600 people in the mess hall, only one person needs to crank it for an hour or two. The tools in the mess hall were improved piece by piece, constantly progressing. Now this mess hall has achieved automated water flow, steamed cooking, and a machine for cutting vegetables.

    Under the help and education of Comrade Lai Yong and others, the staff in the mess hall did not harbor any selfishness in distributing food or anything else; they did not act arbitrarily but always discussed things with the commune members. The masses said: "In the past, people said that everyone 'bends their fingers inwards but not outwards' (referring to people having selfish intentions), but our cadres and cooks are not this kind of people, their fingers are straight."

    The cadres of the Shao厝 Production Team eat together with the commune members in the mess hall, not showing any special treatment. Once, a cook saw that Lai Yong was working very hard and wanted to let him eat better, but Lai Yong said, "It's good for you to take care of me like this, but if you do this, I will be separated from the masses." Comrade Lai Yong set an example and often educated the comrades working in the mess hall to share the joys and sorrows with the masses. The commune members often said: "With such cadres, our mess hall will not disperse for thousands of generations."

    Relying on Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

    To run a good mess hall, it is necessary to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants. The mess hall's managers, cooks, vegetable professional group, and poultry and livestock professional group, a total of twenty-four people, include six Party members and two Youth League members, of whom twenty-one are poor and lower-middle peasants. This is the most powerful guarantee for running a good mess hall.

    "Poor people are good at managing a family," this is the commune members' fair evaluation of the cooks from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds. Because they are good at planning grain use and cherish grain like pearls. Last year, after the rice harvest, the cook Lin Xiulian used rice straw to burn the fire and found unthreshed grains, so she rubbed the rice straw with her hands and picked up a handful of grains. After that, whether she burned rice straw, bean stalks, or wheat straw, she paid attention to picking up the unthreshed grains. In the past, sweet potato heads and tails were used to feed pigs. Now, they grind these things, wash them into sweet potato flour, use the residue to feed pigs, and use the flour to make cakes, which not only saves grain but is also popular with the commune members.

    The Shao厝 Mess Hall has a management committee that studies work every ten days or half a month; major matters must be discussed and decided at a general meeting of commune members. The cooks hold a life meeting every week to review their work. The cadres also humbly listen to the opinions of the commune members and study and solve problems at any time. The mess hall is getting better and better, and the masses are becoming more and more satisfied. Once, the commune members reflected that the distribution of food was unfair. The mess hall immediately conducted an inspection and found that the amount of rice put in when cooking was not accurately controlled, and immediate measures were taken to correct it.

    The mess hall staff also consciously placed themselves under the supervision of the masses, implementing "four samenesses" in life (same food, same dishes, eating at the same table, discussing together), listening to the opinions of the masses, and relying on the masses to run the mess hall well. In terms of accounts, they achieve daily clearing, ten-day settlements, and monthly announcements.

    Diligently and Frugally Establishing a Family Fortune

    The Shao厝 Mess Hall has explored a whole set of methods for planning and saving grain. Summarized, it is the four words "vegetables, early, thrift, management." "Vegetables" means cooking more pickled vegetable rice during the peak vegetable harvest season, which not only saves grain but also suits the tastes of the commune members. "Early" means arranging the masses' rations early as soon as the grain is harvested, mobilizing the masses to calculate carefully, planning grain use, and making overall arrangements. "Thrift" means advocating frugality and long-term savings, treating rich days as poor days. "Management" means strengthening grain management, ensuring that grain consumption is planned, with fixed quantities for each month, each day, and each meal. The mess hall receives grain from the production team's warehouse according to fixed quantities every five days, and the cooks weigh the grain according to the number of people eating each meal before putting it into the pot.

    The Shao厝 Production Team has done a very good job in vegetable production, with a complete variety of vegetables; in addition, it has also organized a livestock professional group to raise chickens, ducks, and pigs, and to raise fish using mountain ponds and reservoirs. At present, the mess hall has vegetable plots, pig pens full of pigs, and flocks of chickens and ducks. The family fortune is gradually becoming abundant, and life is getting better day by day.

    This production team originally did not have a dining hall, and building one was a difficult problem due to materials and funds. After hearing the news that a dining hall was to be built, the commune members strongly supported it and said happily: "Don't be afraid of difficulties, we will build it even if we have to carry a load of soil and a stone each." So everyone engaged in production during the day and dug soil and built walls at night, solving the problems of materials and technology themselves. It was through such diligence and thrift, with the support of the county and commune, that a large dining hall for more than 600 people was built in a very short time.

    Running Collective Welfare Undertakings Well

    The mess hall staff truly provides thoughtful service to the commune members. Old commune member Lai Shizhong was sick once, and the cook Lai Lihua cooked vermicelli for him and added eggs. Old Mrs. Wang Aqi, who is over seventy years old, lives in the west end of the village, far from the mess hall, so Lai Lihua delivers meals to her door, three meals a day, without missing a single one. In addition to the ten kilograms of rice allocated by the mess hall, postpartum women can also buy some duck eggs, dried fish, and salted eggs from the mess hall; the children in the nursery are also fed rice porridge twice a day by the mess hall as snacks, and they all eat until they are white and plump.

    The Party branch also used the mess hall as the center to drive collective welfare undertakings, not only attaching a small store and service department, but also establishing nurseries, kindergartens, clubs, health rooms, sewing groups, barber shops, etc., so that the lives of the commune members were comprehensively grasped.

    The Shao厝 Mess Hall is a red flag for public mess halls in Jinjiang County, and the Jinjiang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is vigorously promoting the experience of the Shao厝 Mess Hall throughout the county.

  　千年万代都不散
    ——磁灶人民公社烧厝生产队食堂办得出色
    中共晋江县委会
    编者按：烧厝生产队公共食堂的经验说明：办好食堂的决定因素在于有好的领导干部和好的食堂工作人员。这个食堂有了赖永等这样一批骨干力量，就可以在公共食堂中实现党的领导，保证党的方针政策的正确贯彻执行。他们的最大特点是具有高度的阶级观念和群众观念，有着饱满的革命热情和实干苦干精神。这是值得大家认真学习的。
    生产和生活，是同一事物的两方面，是辩证的统一。只有把生产搞好了，搞好生活才有物质基础和可靠的保证；只有生活搞好了，群众才有饱满的精神和冲天的干劲，生产才能取得持续的跃进。办好食堂，这是一件大事，各地党委一定要把生活当作一个重大政治任务来抓，把它抓紧、抓到底。
    福建晋江县磁灶公社烧厝生产队的食堂办得很好，很出色，远近闻名。这个队六百一十七人，全部参加了食堂。由于食堂办得好，以及其他工作也搞得好，所以几年来农业生产连续获得了好收成，扔掉了缺粮队的帽子，变成了余粮队。
    书记办食堂政治进厨房
    加强党的领导，把关心人、体贴人，公道、能干的党员、干部派到食堂去，是办好食堂的关键。出身贫农的赖永等同志，便是这样的干部。赖永等同志是生产队的党支部副书记，为了办好食堂，他亲自当食堂主任，而且住进了厨房。他领导炊事员修订管理制度，改善经营管理，实行计划用粮，建立副食品基地，改进炊事工具，勤俭建设饭厅，组织炊事员展开竞赛评比。总之，厨房里大大小小的事，他几乎样样都管。
    赖永等同志看到炊事员夏天守在灶口烧火，又热、又受熏；另一个炊事员到老远的地方挑水，整天挑水还供应不上。他和泥水匠赖永竖商量，把锅灶由老式单锅灶，改为新式三联排灶，把灶口由室内改在室外，使烧火的由八个人减为三个人；他又和炊事员商量，在食堂的院子里打了一口深井，用吊杆提水，让水自流入锅，大大减轻了炊事员的劳动量。今年春天，他学习了外地经验，做成了手摇竹筒抽水机。现在食堂六百多人用水，只要一个人摇上一两点钟就行了。食堂的工具就这样一件一件地改，不断地进步。现在这个食堂已是用水自流化，作饭蒸气化，切菜有机器。
    食堂里的工作人员，在赖永等同志的帮助教育下，分饭、分东西不存任何私心；办事不独断独行，总要和社员商量着办。群众说：“过去说人都是‘指头屈入不屈出’（指人都有私心），我们的干部和炊事员就不是这种人，他们指头都是伸的直直的。”
    烧厝生产队的干部同社员一齐在食堂吃饭，一点不闹特殊。有一次一个炊事员看到赖永等工作很辛苦，想让他吃得好一些，赖永等便说：“你这样照顾我是好的，可是这样做我就要脱离群众了。”赖永等同志以身作则，并且经常教育在食堂工作的同志，要和群众同甘共苦。社员常说：“有了这样的干部，我们的食堂千年万代都不会散。”
    依靠贫农、下中农
    要办好食堂，必须依靠贫农、下中农。这个食堂的管理员、炊事员和蔬菜专业组、禽畜专业组一共二十四个人，有六个是党员，有两个是团员，其中有二十一个贫农、下中农，这是办好食堂最有力的保证。
    “穷人善理家”，这是社员对贫农、下中农出身的炊事员公正的评语。因为他们善于计划用粮，爱粮如珠。去年稻谷收割后，炊事员林秀恋用稻草烧火，发现有脱不净的谷粒，于是用手搓了稻草，拾起一把谷子；之后，她无论烧稻草、烧豆秆、烧麦草都注意把没有打净的粮食拣起来。甘薯头尾过去是喂猪用的，现在她们把这些东西磨碎了，洗成薯粉，以渣喂猪，用粉做糕粿，既节约粮食，又受社员欢迎。
    烧厝食堂有一个管理委员会，十天或半月研究一次工作；一些重大事情，都要召开社员大会讨论决定。炊事员每周开一次生活会，检查工作。干部也虚心听取社员意见，随时研究解决问题，食堂越办越好，群众越来越满意。有一次，社员反映分饭不公平。食堂马上作了检查，原来是煮饭下米时没有掌握准定量，立即采取措施改正了。
    食堂工作人员，也自觉地把自己置于群众监督之下，在生活上实行“四同”（同饭、同菜、同桌吃、同商量），倾听群众的意见，依靠群众办好食堂。在账目上，做到日清、旬结，一月一公布。
    克勤克俭建立家底
    烧厝食堂已经摸索出一整套计划用粮、节约用粮的办法。概括起来，就是“菜、早、俭、管”四个字，“菜”，就是在蔬菜盛收季节，多煮咸菜饭，这样，不但节约粮食，而且适合社员口味。“早”，就是粮食一收，便把群众口粮早早安排好，发动群众精打细算，计划用粮，全面安排。“俭”，就是提倡省吃俭用、细水长流，把富日子当穷日子过。“管”，就是加强粮食管理，作到吃粮有计划，每月、每天、每顿有定量。食堂每五天向生产队仓库按定量领粮一次，炊事员根据开膳人数逐餐领粮过秤下锅。
    烧厝生产队蔬菜生产搞得很好，品种齐全；另外，还组织了畜牧专业小组，养鸡、养鸭、喂猪，利用山塘水库养鱼。目前食堂已是种菜成片，养猪满栏，鸡鸭成群，家底逐渐丰厚，生活一天好似一天。
    这个生产队原来没有饭厅，要兴建，材料、资金又是个难题。社员听到要建饭厅的消息后，非常拥护，欢天喜地说：“有困难不要怕，我们一个人一担土、一块石头也要把它建起来。”于是大家白天搞生产，晚上就挖土砌墙，材料、技术都是自己解决。就是这样克勤克俭，在县、社的支持下，一座六百多人的大饭厅，在很短的时间里就建成了。
    办好集体福利事业
    食堂工作人员对社员真是服务周到。老社员赖世忠有一次病了，炊事员赖丽花就给他煮粉干，还加上鸡蛋；七十多岁的老太太王阿起，住在村西头，离食堂远，赖丽花就给她送饭上门，一日三餐，顿顿不误。产妇除了由食堂另外拨给十斤大米，还可以到食堂买些鸭蛋、鱼干、咸蛋；托儿所的小孩，也由食堂每天煮两次米糊做点心，个个吃得白胖胖的。
    党支部还以食堂为中心，把集体福利事业带动起来，不仅附设了小卖部、服务部，还设立了托儿所、幼儿园、俱乐部、保健室、缝衣组、理发室等等，这样就全面地把社员的生活抓起来了。
    烧厝食堂是晋江县公共食堂一面红旗，中共晋江县委正在全县大力推广烧厝食堂的经验。
