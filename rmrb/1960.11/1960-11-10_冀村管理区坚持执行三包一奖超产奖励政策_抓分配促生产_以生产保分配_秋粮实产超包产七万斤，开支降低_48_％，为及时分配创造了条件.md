    Taiyuan, November 9th (Reported by this newspaper) - The Jicun Management Area Party Branch of the Xingfu Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, started with a trial calculation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" implementation, followed by a trial distribution of income. Now, it is launching a mass movement involving the entire Party and all the people, centered around the fulfillment of individual labor plans, team overproduction plans, and the management area's distribution plan. This movement aims to achieve a "three-linked" mutual guarantee of fulfillment, overproduction beyond guaranteed targets, increased income, and reduced expenses.
    Currently, all autumn grain crops in this management area have been harvested and stored, with actual production exceeding guaranteed production by 70,000 jin. The value of harvested agricultural and sideline products has exceeded 7,889 yuan. The harvested cotton, due to attention to grading, has greatly improved in quality. The portion already sold has increased income by 2,754 yuan. In terms of saving expenses, due to the extensive use of waste materials, management fees and agricultural tool repair costs alone have been reduced by 48% compared to planned expenditures. The realization of production increase and savings plans ensures that the overproduction plans of each production team and the income increase plans of each commune member's household can all be fulfilled.
    Faced with this situation, some cadres and commune members of the production teams proposed that the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" and the distribution trial calculation should be implemented immediately. They believe that the grain is already in hand, overproduction is already a certainty, and income from sideline occupations and the sale of grain and cotton is constantly flowing in, so it can be implemented now. However, some cadres said that it should be implemented once at the end-of-year settlement. This proposition aroused dissatisfaction among many team cadres and commune members.
    The Party Branch believes that the demands of the masses are correct. Because the trial calculation for the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" and the trial distribution of income to households not only completes the first step in promoting overproduction and income increase and ensuring the realization of fulfillment, but more importantly, it is about how to achieve 100% fulfillment in a timely manner, to maximize everyone's enthusiasm for production. In order to continue promoting the overproduction and income increase movement and create conditions for the thorough realization of distribution fulfillment, the Party Branch promptly put forward the resounding slogan of "Say what you mean, don't make empty promises," and decided that anything that can be fulfilled today should not wait until tomorrow. According to this principle, the management area resolutely carried out the timely fulfillment of what could be fulfilled now. The specific methods are as follows: 10% of the overproduction of grain is awarded to each team according to the original regulations, and each team adjusts the food consumption of commune members based on their actual labor days on a monthly basis, and insists on implementing the system of grain to the hall, eating with tickets, and saving for oneself; 90% of the remaining amount is paid in cash by the management area; because the overproduction part of the output value of cotton and vegetables has not yet been fully harvested, only 20% of the bonus that should be awarded for the current overproduction is awarded now, and the remaining part will be settled after all autumn crops such as cotton, oil, and vegetables are harvested; in order to pay wages to commune members in a timely manner, 3,500 yuan of wages were pre-paid in conjunction with arranging for commune members to spend the winter and change seasons. In this way, together with the wages and other advances and loans that have been issued in the past, 76% of the wage portion that should be distributed this year has been distributed to the commune members. At the same time, in conjunction with clearing up the economic relationship with the commune members over the past year, all 1,088 yuan of fertilizer funds applied by the collective for the commune members were repaid, 754 yuan for furniture and agricultural tools lost or damaged by the collective use of the commune members, and 205 yuan for the rent that should be paid for the houses occupied by the collective for the commune members. The small plots of land and the "ten-edge" land that the production team should harvest were all harvested by the team, and the team handled them according to the prescribed distribution ratio. The scattered small plots of land in front of and behind the houses of the commune members were all harvested by the commune members.
    When the above series of fulfillment was realized, the broad masses of cadres and the masses said with satisfaction: This is what is called a copper-bottomed and iron-clad policy and realistic work. Commune member Li Fuquan said: This year, everything has been fulfilled, and the enthusiasm for the New Year is even greater.
    The Jicun Management Area mainly has the following experiences in realizing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" fulfillment process:
    1. Go deep to the "bottom." Since the trial calculation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" fulfillment, the Party Branch has put forward the resounding slogan of "Overproduction and then overproduction, the determination to fulfill" to the production team, thereby encouraging the production team to actively strive for overproduction. After the trial calculation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" showed the overproduction teams and the production reduction teams, the Party Branch immediately adopted the method of dividing the work and assigning responsibility to each team to strengthen the specific assistance and guidance to the production teams. At the same time, it seized the weak links and strengthened the leadership of the production reduction teams. The branch secretary and director took over the first and fourth teams, which were trial-calculated to reduce production, and the deputy branch secretary and deputy director took over the second and third teams, which were trial-calculated to overproduce. After the trial calculation of income distribution to households showed the households with flat income and reduced income, the Party Branch again determined that each branch committee member and management committee member would take charge of three households, and also took over the households with flat income and reduced income, assisting these households in increasing production and income in many ways.
    2. Everyone does their best. According to the principle put forward by the Party Branch, "Do whatever you can do," each team vigorously tapped labor potential and gave full play to everyone's positive role in realizing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" and distribution fulfillment. For example, in the autumn harvest work, strong laborers were assigned to cut, pull, transport, and beat in distant places; secondary laborers were assigned to move, pick up, lift, and peel in nearby places; auxiliary laborers were assigned to the field to peel corn, pick cotton, select seeds, and sweep up dropped grain.
    3. Improve work efficiency. Since the trial calculation and fulfillment of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward," the broad masses of commune members have vigorously carried forward the fine style of being red, diligent, ingenious, and thrifty in the labor competition for overproduction and income increase. They do not waste time, do not travel empty, and the habit of carrying out sideline labor has become a common practice. Labor miracles of one person doing the work of two people and one hand doing the work of two hands appear everywhere. Commune members generally bring water, food, and fertilizer to the fields, and bring grass, vegetables, and crops back to the village.
    4. More overproduction. In order to achieve more overproduction, the Party Branch grasped the fine and careful harvest. For example, they took advantage of the morning and evening when there was moisture to transport crops that were easy to fall off the spikes and grains, and transported crops that were not easy to fall off the spikes and grains in the morning and afternoon. The Second Production Team used corn stalks to surround the yards to prevent chickens and livestock from damaging the grain. During the second autumn harvest movement in the entire region, due to the emphasis on re-picking, re-turning the stalks, and re-beating, grain production increased by 7,800 jin.
    5. Help each other. In the intense rush-harvesting and fine-harvesting movement, the first team, which was trial-calculated to reduce production, overcame its low mood after ideological education, and mustered the energy to strive for overproduction, and challenged the third team, which was trial-calculated to overproduce. After they worked hard and completed each production task, the third team would always send representatives to deliver the "Fulfillment" good news to encourage them to make persistent efforts and move forward together. Under the encouragement of mutual promotion, the autumn grain harvesting tasks of both teams were completed ahead of schedule, and both achieved overproduction.

    冀村管理区坚持执行三包一奖超产奖励政策
    抓分配促生产　以生产保分配
    秋粮实产超包产七万斤，开支降低48％，为及时分配创造了条件
    本报太原9日电　山西汾阳县幸福公社冀村管理区党支部，从三包一奖兑现试算开始，紧接着进行了收益分配的试算试分，现在又以人人劳动计划兑现、队队超产计划兑现、管理区分配方案兑现为内容，发动全党全民开展了人、队、区三连环互保兑现的超包产、增收入、省开支的群众运动。
    目前，这个管理区秋粮作物已全部收打入库，实产量超包产七万斤。已收获的农副产品的产值超过了七千八百八十九元。采回来的棉花，由于注意分级工作，大大提高了等级，已售出部分，即增加收入二千七百五十四元。在节约开支方面，由于大量地利用了废物废料，仅管理费和农具修配费两项，就比计划开支降低了48％。由于增产节约计划的实现，就保证了各生产队的超产计划和社员各户的增收计划全部可以兑现。
    面对这样的形势，有些生产队的干部和社员提出三包一奖、分配试算，现在就要兑现。他们认为粮食已经拿到手超产已经定局，副业收入和卖粮卖棉的收入源源不断，现在就可兑现了。可是，有些干部说什么要等到年终决算一次兑现。这种主张，引起了不少队干部和社员的不满。
    党支部认为群众的要求是正确的。因为三包一奖的兑现试算和收益分配的试分到户，不仅是为促进超产增收和保证实现兑现走完了第一步，而更重要的还是如何能够及时地做到百分之百兑现，以最大限度地调动大家的生产积极性。为了继续推动超产增收运动的开展，为彻底实现分配兑现创造条件，党支部及时提出了“说到做到，不放空炮”的宏亮口号，决定凡是能够今天兑现的不等明天。按照这条方针，管理区果断地将现在能够兑现的及时进行了兑现。具体的作法是：粮食的超产部分按原规定以10％奖给各队，由各该队以社员实作劳动日分月调剂食用，并坚持实行粮食到堂、凭票吃饭、节约归己的制度，其余90％由管理区付给现款；产值的超产部分因棉花、蔬菜尚未全部收获，现在只奖予现已超产部分应奖励的20％，其余部分待棉、油、菜等全部秋作物收获后结算；为及时给社员发放工资，结合安排社员过冬换季，预发了工资三千五百元。这样，连同过去已经发放的工资以及其它预支预借款，已把今年应分配工资部分的76％发到社员手里。与此同时，结合清理一年来与社员的经济往来关系，全部偿还了集体施用社员的肥料款一千零八十八元，集体使用丢损了社员的家具、农具款七百五十四元，集体占用了社员房屋应付的租赁费二百零五元。生产队应收获的小块地、十边地都归队进行了收获，并按规定分配的比例，由队进行了处理。社员房前房后的零星小块地都归社员收获。
    当实现了上述一系列的兑现以后，广大干部群众满意地说：这才叫铜帮铁底的政策，实事求是的工作。社员李富全说：今年甚也兑了现，过年的干劲更大了。
    冀村管理区实现三包一奖兑现过程中，主要有以下几条经验：
    一、深入到“底”。试算三包一奖兑现以来，党支部就向生产队提出了“超产再超产，决心要兑现”的响亮口号，从而鼓舞生产队积极努力争取超产。当通过三包一奖试算表示出超产队和减产队之后，党支部立即采取分工把口包干到队的办法，加强了对生产队的具体帮助和指导。同时抓住薄弱环节，加强了对减产队的领导。支部书记、主任把试算减产的一、四队包下来，副支部书记、副主任把试算超产的二、三队包下来。当通过收益分配试算到户表示出平收、减收户之后，党支部又确定各支部委员和管理委员每人包三户，把平收、减收户也包下来，从多方面协助这些户增产增收。
    二、各尽所能。各队根据党支部提出的能干啥就干啥的原则，大力挖掘了劳动潜力，充分发挥了每个人为实现三包一奖、分配兑现的积极作用。如在秋收工作上强劳力就分配上远地割、拉、运、打；次弱的劳力分配上近地搬、拾、抬、剥；辅助劳力分配到场上，剥玉米、拣棉花、选种籽、扫落粮。
    三、提高工效。三包一奖试算兑现以来，广大社员在超产增收的劳动竞赛中，大力发扬了红勤巧俭的优良作风，时不空过，路不空行，捎带劳动形成风气，一人顶两人，一手顶两手的劳动奇迹到处出现。社员上地普遍作到出村捎水、捎饭、捎肥，回村捎草、捎菜、捎庄稼。
    四、更多超产。为了更多超产，党支部抓住了精打细收。例如趁早晨、侧黑有潮气拉运易于崩落穗粒的作物，上午下午拉运不易崩落穗粒的作物。第二生产队利用玉茭秆把场面都包围起来，防止了鸡、畜损害粮食。全区二次秋收运动中，由于强调了再细拾、再翻秸、再复打，多增产粮食七千八百斤。
    五、互相帮助。在紧张的抢收、细收运动中，试算减产的第一队，经过思想教育，克服了低落情绪，鼓足力争超产的干劲，向试算超产的第三队提出了挑战。当他们经过奋发努力，完成每一段生产任务之后，第三队总要派代表送去“兑现”喜报，鼓励他们再接再厉，共同前进。在互相促进的鼓励下，两个队的秋粮收打任务都提前完成，而且都达到了超产。
