    Nanjing Fully Utilizes Waterways to Open Nine New Shipping Routes
    (Our report) Nanjing’s transportation departments are making full use of the natural conditions of the Yangtze River and the inner and outer Qinhuai Rivers to actively open up water transport lines to transport grain, steel, and other key materials quickly and in large quantities.
    The Nanjing area has abundant water resources. In order to make full use of these rivers and open up more航线[hángxiàn - shipping routes], leading cadres from city, county, and district transportation departments have gone to the front lines of transportation and worked with boatmen and technicians to study waterways, survey docks, bridges, and culverts, and understand the flow of materials. At the same time, they have gone deep into key factories and mines to proactively help them solve problems with short-distance transportation tools for the transfer of water and land transportation. At present, nine water transportation lines have been opened in Qinhuai, Jianye, and other districts, undertaking the transportation of key materials such as smelting materials, grain, building materials, and market supplies for the Fenghuangshan Iron Mine, Shimenkan Steel Plant, and Youheng Flour Mill.
    The opening of water transportation lines has increased water transport capacity. The city's water transport volume in October increased by 10% compared to September, and the transport volume in the first five days of November increased by 5% compared to the same period last month, ensuring the timely transportation of key materials such as ore and coal for various factories and mines along the route.

    南京充分利用河道增辟九条航线
    本报讯　南京市交通运输部门充分利用长江和内外秦淮河的自然条件，积极增辟水上运输线，多运快运粮、钢等重点物资。
    南京地区水源充足，为了充分利用这些江河，增辟更多的航线，市、县、区交通部门各级领导干部，曾到运输第一线和船工、技术人员一起研究水道，勘探码头、桥涵等，并了解物资流向。同时又深入重点厂矿，主动帮助他们解决水陆运输接转的短驳工具等问题。目前全市已先后在秦淮、建邺等区开辟了九条水上运输线，承担起凤凰山铁矿、石门坎钢铁厂、有恒面粉厂等冶炼物资、粮食、建筑材料、市场供应等重点物资的运输任务。
    水上运输线的增辟，提高了水运能力，10月份全市水上运输量较9月增长10％，11月头五天的运输量又比上月同期增长5％，保证了沿线各厂矿矿石煤炭等重点物资的及时运输。
