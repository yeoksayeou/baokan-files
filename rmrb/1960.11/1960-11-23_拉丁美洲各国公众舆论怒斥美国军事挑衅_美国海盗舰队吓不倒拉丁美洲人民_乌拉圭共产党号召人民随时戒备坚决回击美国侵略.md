Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 22nd - According to TASS, Montevideo, 22nd: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uruguay issued a special statement on the US threat of aggression against Cuba, condemning the US policy towards Cuba and protesting Eisenhower's decision to station troops in the Caribbean region.

The statement said, "This extreme military measure by US imperialism is part of the preparation for aggression against the Cuban people and opposition to their glorious revolution."

The statement went on to point out that the entry of the US Navy into combat readiness, as well as the preparations being carried out by Batista's henchmen in the United States, Guatemala, and other countries in the Caribbean region, are aimed at creating conditions for the landing of US "Marines" in Cuba and facilitating all provocations carried out for this purpose. In addition, this is also to stifle the anti-imperialist liberation movement that is flourishing in Latin America through extensive military measures.

In its statement, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uruguay called on the Uruguayan people and their organizations to be deeply aware of the dangers of the current situation, to unite and mobilize all democratic forces to express their warmest solidarity with Cuba and their protest against the predatory actions of US imperialism. The statement called on the people to be ready at any time to resolutely repel US acts of aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, San José, 21st - A leader of the People's Vanguard Party of Costa Rica issued a statement to the press and radio today, condemning the US action of sending aircraft and fleets to the Caribbean Sea as a direct and obvious threat to Cuba, a military intervention, and a threat to international peace.

The statement pointed out that Cuba is not isolated in its struggle against aggression. All Latin American people, the countries of the socialist camp, and the people's governments of countries that have freed themselves from the shackles of colonialism and imperialism are with Cuba.

The statement condemned the US government's action for also shamelessly defending those military dictatorships. The statement said that the United States has consistently pursued a policy of supporting unpopular governments in Central America maintained by force under the hypocritical guise of the "non-interference" principle. Now, we see the Washington government engaging in blatant intervention. We believe that this incident can make the world see clearly what only a few people saw clearly before: that genuine and resolute opposition to these Latin American dictatorships cannot but first struggle against the main force supporting them - US imperialism.

The statement condemned the Costa Rican government for placing itself in a plan to defend Somoza, and stated that the Costa Rican people support the struggle against the dictatorships in Guatemala and Nicaragua.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 21st - Several Argentine youth groups held a mass rally in the capital yesterday in support of Cuba, with more than 5,000 young people participating. The rally was organized by the Argentine University Federation, the Argentine Student Federation, the Argentine Committee, the Secondary School Student Federation, the Youth Committee of the Trade Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement, and youth organizations of some political parties.

In the park where the rally was held, slogans were hung on the trees indicating that Argentine youth support Cuba and the people of all countries struggling for independence.

Many entertainment programs were also performed at the rally. During the performance, the masses constantly shouted slogans such as "Cuba yes, Yankees no!" An art troupe named "Black Little Angels" specially came from Uruguay and performed Cuban folk music, which won warm applause from the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 21st - The Argentine Trade Union Solidarity and Cooperation Movement once again issued a statement expressing its support for the Cuban Revolution.

After listening to a report by Benedo Mataeu, the secretary of the newspaper workers' union, on a recent meeting of the Cuban Workers' Confederation that he attended, the organization decided to reaffirm its support for the Cuban Revolution; participate in the Argentine million-signature campaign in support of Cuba; and mobilize Argentine workers to support the struggle of the Algerian people.

In order to support the Cuban people, the Argentine Women's Federation sent a set of surgical equipment for treating rural mothers to the Cuban Women's Federation. The money used to purchase this set of equipment was raised by the organization's branches across the country. An Argentine flag was also sent with the equipment. The Argentine Women's Federation also announced that it had begun collecting signatures in support of Cuba and was preparing to participate in the fundraising campaign to purchase tractors to support Cuba.

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd - Newspapers in Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil have unanimously condemned the US military provocations in the Caribbean Sea.

An editorial published in the Chilean "Siglo" on the 20th said, "The US practice of sending its fleet to patrol the Caribbean Sea confirms its previous acts of intervention." The editorial said that the actions taken by the US government are an attempt to stop the mobilization of the Latin American people, weaken their surging struggle for their rights, and violently destroy the achievements of the Cuban Revolution. After talking about the achievements of the Cuban Revolution and the warm support expressed by the people of Latin American countries for these achievements of the Cuban people, the editorial said, "Fearing the awakening of the people, imperialism and their pirate fleets have taken action. However, the people's movement in Latin America will rise up like an impenetrable Great Wall against them, the people's movement will not be intimidated, they are with the Cuban Revolution, and are forming and will continue to form a glorious fighting guard."

An editorial published by the non-partisan morning newspaper "La Hora" on the 20th, entitled "War Patrol in the Caribbean," said that the White House's decision to send warships and military aircraft to the Caribbean region for "protective" patrols once again shows that the United States is fully defending the dictatorial regimes in Latin America. The editorial said that the US accusation that the Cuban government is an autocratic regime is "due to the fate suffered by the capital of this northern power in this small Caribbean country. This country has decided to regain its independence in order to carry out work that is beneficial to the Cuban people."

An editorial published by the "Jornal do Commercio," the organ of the Rio de Janeiro Student Federation of Brazil, on the 20th regarding the recent US sending of a fleet to carry out provocations in the Caribbean Sea, said, "We are once again facing a period of 'natural intervention' by the Marines, a period of 'protection' in order to allow the United Fruit Company to continue to enjoy privileges." After condemning the Eisenhower government's approach, the editorial said that now is the time for Eisenhower to understand this: "We will never compromise with diplomacy that uses the Marines."

    拉丁美洲各国公众舆论怒斥美国军事挑衅
    美国海盗舰队吓不倒拉丁美洲人民
    乌拉圭共产党号召人民随时戒备坚决回击美国侵略
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚22日讯：乌拉圭共产党中央委员会就美国对古巴的侵略威胁发表特别声明，谴责美国对古巴的政策，抗议艾森豪威尔陈兵加勒比海地区的决定。
    声明中说，“美帝国主义的这一极端的军事措施是侵略古巴人民和反对他们光荣的革命的准备活动的一部分”。
    声明接着指出，美国海军的进入作战准备以及巴蒂斯塔走狗在美国、危地马拉以及加勒比海地区其他国家进行的准备，目的在于为美国“海军陆战队”在古巴登陆创造条件，并有利于制造为此目的而进行的一切挑衅事件。此外，这样做也是为了用广泛的军事措施来窒息在拉丁美洲蓬勃开展起来的反帝解放运动。
    乌拉圭共产党中央委员会在声明中号召乌拉圭人民和他们的组织深切地意识到目前局势的危险性，团结和动员一切民主力量，来表示自己对古巴的最热烈的声援和对美帝国主义强盗行径的抗议。声明号召人民随时戒备着，以便给予美国的侵略行动以坚决回击。
    新华社圣约瑟21日电　哥斯达黎加人民先锋党领导人今天向报界和电台发表声明，谴责美国向加勒比海出动飞机和舰队的行动是对古巴的直接、明显的威胁和军事干涉，也是对国际和平的威胁。
    声明指出，古巴在反对侵略的斗争中并不是孤立的。所有拉丁美洲人民，社会主义阵营各国以及摆脱了殖民主义和帝国主义束缚的国家的人民政府都和古巴在一起。
    声明谴责美国政府这一行动的目的还在于无耻地保卫那些军事专制政权。声明说，美国一贯在伪善的“不干涉”原则的外衣掩护下，执行支持中美的不得人心的用武力维持的政府的政策。现在，我们看到华盛顿政府进行赤裸裸的干涉。我们认为，这一事件能够使全世界一目了然地看清以前只有少数人看清的事实：真正和坚决地反对这些拉丁美洲的独裁政权，不能不首先同支持它们的主要力量——美帝国主义进行斗争。
    声明谴责哥斯达黎加政府已置身于保卫索摩查的计划中，声明说，哥斯达黎加人民支持反对危地马拉和尼加拉瓜独裁政权的斗争。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯21日电　几个阿根廷青年团体昨天在首都举行了一个有五千多名青年参加的支持古巴的群众大会。组织这次群众大会的有阿根廷大学生联合会、阿根廷学生联合会、阿根廷委员会、中学生联合会、工会团结合作运动青年委员会和一些政党的青年组织。
    在举行这次集会的公园里，树上挂着表明阿根廷青年支援古巴和支援为争取独立而斗争的各国人民的标语牌。
    在这次集会上还表演了许多文娱节目。在节目演出期间，群众不断高呼“要古巴，不要美国佬！”等口号。特地从乌拉圭赶来的一个名叫“黑色的小天使”的艺术团演出了古巴的民间音乐，博得了群众的热烈掌声。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯21日电  阿根廷工会团结合作运动再次发表声明，表示支持古巴革命。
    这个组织在听取了报业工会书记贝内多·马太乌关于他所出席的古巴工人联合会最近召开的一次会议的报告之后，决定重申支持古巴革命；参加阿根廷一百万人签名支持古巴的运动；并动员阿根廷工人支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。
    为了支持古巴人民，阿根廷妇女联合会给古巴妇女联合会寄去一套为农村母亲治病的外科器械设备。购买这套器械所用的钱是这个组织的全国各地分会募集的。随设备寄去的还有一面阿根廷的国旗。阿根廷妇女联合会还宣布，它已经开始征集支持古巴的签名，同时准备参加购买支援古巴的拖拉机的募捐运动。
    据新华社22日讯　智利、乌拉圭和巴西的报纸一致谴责美国在加勒比海的军事挑衅行动。
    智利“世纪报”20日发表的社论说，“美国派遣它的舰队巡逻加勒比海的做法证实了它以前所采取的干涉行为”。社论说，美国政府采取的行动是企图制止动员拉丁美洲的人民群众，削弱他们争取自己权利的汹涌澎湃的斗争和用暴力摧毁古巴革命的成就。社论在谈到古巴革命的成就和拉丁美洲各国人民对古巴人民所取得的这些成就所表示的热烈支持以后说，“由于对人民的觉醒感到恐惧，帝国主义和它们的海盗舰队行动了起来。但是，拉丁美洲的人民运动将像一堵不可通过的长城一样起来反对他们，人民运动不会被吓倒，它们与古巴革命在一起，正在组成并将继续组成一支光荣的战斗的近卫队。”
    无党派的晨报“号角报”20日以“在加勒比的战争巡逻”为题发表的社论说，白宫关于派遣军舰和军用飞机到加勒比地区进行“保护”巡逻的决定又一次表明美国在全力保卫拉丁美洲的独裁政权。社论说，美国的所谓古巴政府是专制的政权的指责是“由于这个北方强国的资本在这个加勒比的小国里所遭受的命运。这个国家决定收回它的独立，以便进行对古巴人民有利的工作”。
    巴西里约热内卢学联机关报“大都会报”20日就美国最近派遣舰队在加勒比海进行挑衅一事发表社论说，“我们又面临海军陆战队的‘天然干涉’的时期，为了使美国联合果品公司能够继续享有特权而实行‘保护’的时期。”社论在谴责艾森豪威尔政府这种做法之后说，现在是艾森豪威尔明白这一点的时候了：“我们决不会同使用海军陆战队的外交妥协。”
