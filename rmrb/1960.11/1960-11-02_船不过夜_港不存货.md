    Ships Don't Stay Overnight, Ports Don't Store Goods
    The Hongya County Shipping Company of Sichuan Province, in its efforts to focus on port operations and rush the loading and transportation of key materials such as grain and steel, has achieved ships not staying overnight and ports not storing iron, increasing shipping efficiency by 25% and adding 2,000 tons of transport capacity for the country each month, effectively promoting transportation production.
    Before May, the weak link in the company's production was the long waiting time for ships to return to port for loading and unloading, sometimes waiting for one or two days. In response to this situation, the company's Party branch strengthened ideological education for employees. Through calculating the waste of transport capacity, employees launched a collaborative competition for fast loading, fast unloading, ships not staying overnight, and no delay of a single ton. The shipping, mass transport, and handling departments helped and supported each other, seizing every minute and second. Currently, rushing the transport of grain and steel has become everyone's conscious action. Dock workers, before ships return to port, utilize production gaps to carry out relay transportation, moving materials to be transported from warehouses to port freight stations, shortening the transportation distance and accelerating the loading and unloading progress, shortening the ships' berthing time. Now, the appearance of the docks has been completely renewed, achieving ships not staying overnight, loading as soon as they arrive, and each fleet can set sail and leave port in just half a day.

    船不过夜  港不存货
    四川省洪雅县航运公司在大抓港湾作业，抢装抢运粮、钢等重点物资的工作中，作到了船不过夜、港不存铁，提高航效25％，每月为国家增加运力两千吨，有力地推动了运输生产。
    5月以前，这个公司生产上的薄弱环节是船只回港待装待卸时间长，有时要等一两天。根据这种情况，公司党支部加强了职工思想教育，职工们通过算运力浪费账，开展快装、快卸、船不过夜、吨不过分的协作竞赛。航运、群运、搬运三个部门，互相帮助，互相支援，争分夺秒，目前抢运粮、钢，已经成为每个人的自觉行动。码头装卸工人在船只未回港前，利用生产空隙，大搞接力运输，将仓库待运物资运至港口货站，缩短了运输距离，加快了装卸进度，缩短了船只停港时间。现在，码头装卸面貌焕然一新，做到了船不过夜，随到随装，每个船队只需半天即可起航出港。
