    A Path is Forged by Walking, Solutions are Found by Thinking:
    Jia Zhonggao Uses Simple Methods to Run an Outstanding Elementary School

    (Our report) In the Yan'an region of Shaanxi Province, people all know Jia Zhonggao, a teacher at the Jinmaju 民办 (Minban - people-run) Elementary School in Fengzhuang Commune, as a people's teacher who has achieved great results by running the school with simple methods. Under the leadership of the local Party organization, this Communist Party member, who came from a poor peasant background and only had two years of schooling, worked diligently and overcame numerous difficulties based on the principle of diligence and thrift in running the school. In a remote mountain valley where schools had never been established before, he founded an elementary school loved by the commune members – the Jinmaju Minban Junior Elementary School.

    The Jinmaju production team includes three villages. In the past, because there was no school, children had to travel more than ten *li* to Fengzhuang Elementary School, and many children could not enroll at the proper age. In 1958, the Party organization decided to establish a minban elementary school here and decided to have Jia Zhonggao, who was then the production team accountant, concurrently serve as a teacher. Jia Zhonggao was both happy and worried. He was happy that their remote mountain valley also had its own school, but he was worried that he had only had two years of schooling and had not even graduated from junior elementary school. How could he be a people's teacher? Ren Zhanbao, the Party Committee Secretary of the commune, and Ye Zengkuan, the Party Branch Secretary of the production team, encouraged him: "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it. A path is forged by walking, and solutions are found by thinking. If your cultural level is low, you can improve as long as you work hard." Jia Zhonggao thought: "Listening to the Party leads to progress, and listening to the Party allows us to overcome difficulties." He resolved to continue.

    Naturally, things would not go smoothly, and Jia Zhonggao encountered countless difficulties in the process, but he faced them all head-on. At the beginning of the school's establishment, the foundation was weak. Apart from a few dilapidated cave dwellings, there was nothing else. "Let's repair them ourselves!" At that time, he also had to work as a production team accountant and had to keep accounts for the team every day. What to do? He thought: "Things are just starting; can I be intimidated by the first difficulty? No!" With the support of the Party branch, he led several older children, working as the main laborer himself and the children as minor laborers, and began repairing the cave dwellings. He returned to the production team to keep accounts at night. In those days, he came home covered in mud every day. His father and wife complained: "How do other people teach? Look at how you teach!" He said: "As long as I do a good job for the Party, what does this matter?" After two or three days, the cave dwellings were repaired. After the cave dwellings were repaired, there were no desks, benches, or other teaching materials, so classes could not be held. The Party branch secretary led him to visit the masses house by house to explain the benefits and difficulties of running a school, and the masses voluntarily lent some desks and benches. It still wasn't enough. So he led the older children to make mud tables and mud benches out of yellow clay. He was afraid that the children would catch a cold sitting on the mud benches, so he went to the countryside to pick up some old burlap sacks and scraps of felt to wrap them. Since there was no blackboard, he used soot ash and black bean water to paint on the wall to replace the blackboard. Since there was no chalk, he used white clay mixed with water and kneaded it into long strips to replace chalk. Since the children had no paper or pencils for writing, he ground yellow soil into powder, made a small wooden plate for each person, and put the powder in it for the children to learn to write and calculate. In this way, the minban junior elementary school, which did not cost a penny, was born in the remote mountain valley of Jinmaju.

    After the school was established, Jia Zhonggao faced new difficulties. When he started teaching, he picked up the book and, oh dear! Not to mention lecturing, he couldn't even recognize all the characters! He stood on the podium and, after speaking for three to five minutes, he had nothing more to say. He thought, "If I don't overcome this difficulty, I won't be able to teach well, and the Party's work will still not be done well." He resolved to study hard and delve into the material. With the specific help of the commune Party committee, he went to Fengzhuang Elementary School, fifteen *li* away, every Sunday to ask for advice. He also participated in the Fengzhuang Elementary School correspondence school. Usually, when he encountered unfamiliar characters or meanings he didn't understand, he would write them down, and when people who could read came to him, he would grab them and ask. At the same time, Ren Zhanbao, the Party Committee Secretary of the commune, and Ye Zengkuan, the Party Branch Secretary of the production team, personally listened to his lectures, pointing out what he had said well and what he had not said well, which further encouraged his confidence. At this time, in order to use all his spare time to concentrate on preparing lessons, he simply moved to the school to live. He taught the children during the day and studied at night. Sometimes he was too busy to cook, so he ate only one meal a day. Later, when the production team Party branch and commune members found out, they brought food to him. After such hard study, he now has a cultural level equivalent to senior high school and can understand Mao Zedong's Selected Works. The quality of his teaching has also improved significantly. The academic performance of the fifty-three students is very good, with the vast majority achieving grades of four or five (on a five-point scale, presumably). First-grade children have reached the four skills: able to recognize, write, calculate, and apply.

    Jia Zhonggao not only overcame numerous difficulties and established a school, but also insisted on implementing the Party's policy of combining labor with education. In recent years, the commune Party committee has allocated more than four *mu* of land to the school, and he himself has led the older children to open up five or six *mu* of wasteland. The commune members enthusiastically supported the school and voluntarily sent chickens, rabbits, and sheep to the school. Jia Zhonggao treated these as teaching venues. When lecturing, he taught on site when possible, such as how crops grow, how to feed chickens, etc. He also treated these as places for children's labor. The older children insisted on about one hour of labor every day, and the younger children were also assigned a certain amount of time to feed chickens and rabbits. This not only taught the children well, but also increased the school's income. This year, the sales of pumpkins, medicinal materials, eggs, etc., amounted to more than 300 yuan. Jia Zhonggao used this money to buy books, paper, pencils, small rubber balls, parallel bars, etc., for the children. After participating in labor, the children developed excellent qualities of love for labor. The commune members generally reflected that "Jia's child (referring to Jia Zhonggao) is indeed a good teacher cultivated by Chairman Mao, and he has taken good care of our children."

    Jia Zhonggao is very passionate about education. In recent years, he has not left the school a single step except for attending meetings. He always uses the heart of a loving mother to care for the children in the school. Since the children live far away and have to cross mountains, he is afraid that the younger children will not be able to walk, so he carries them home on his back. Whenever there is wind and rain, he carries even more of them. One day in the summer of this year, there was a heavy rain, and the river water rose sharply by two feet. More than forty children had to cross the river to get home. He was worried that the children would not be able to cross the river safely by themselves, so he carried one on his back and held one in his arms, and in this way, he carried all forty-odd children across the river one by one. When the child Zuo Shuanlang fell ill, he carried the child home. Because the child's parents were busy with work and could not take care of him for a while, he ran more than ten *li* to ask for a doctor and buy medicine, which moved the child and his parents to tears. At noon, some children who lived far away did not go home, so he washed their faces and hands and cooked rice soup for them. Because Jia Zhonggao loves children, many parents sent some toddlers who were not yet of school age to the school, asking Jia Zhonggao to help take care of them. Although Jia Zhonggao was very busy, he still gladly agreed to the parents' request and formed a kindergarten class with eleven toddlers.

    Now, Jinmaju Elementary School has been rated as an advanced collective unit participating in this year's National Congress of Cultural and Educational Heroes and has become a red banner for minban elementary schools nationwide. Jia Zhonggao's father and wife, who originally complained about him, now understand that Jia Zhonggao is wholeheartedly working for the collective, and not only do they no longer complain, but they also actively help Jia Zhonggao.

    路是人走出来的　办法是人找到的
    贾仲高用穷办法办起出色的小学校
    本报讯　在陕西省延安地区，人们都知道冯庄公社金马驹民办小学教师贾仲高，是一个用穷办法办学取得很大成绩的人民教师。这个只念过二年书的贫农出身的共产党员，在当地党组织领导下，本着勤俭办学的原则，埋头苦干，克服了重重困难，在历史上从来没有办过学校的偏僻深山沟里，办起了一所为社员群众热爱的小学——金马驹民办初级小学。
    金马驹生产队包括三个村庄。过去，由于没有学校，孩子要跑到十多里外的冯庄小学去念书，好多孩子不能按龄入学。1958年，党组织决定在这里办一所民办小学，并决定由当时担任生产队会计的贾仲高兼任教师。贾仲高真是又喜又愁，喜的是：咱深山沟里也有了自己的学校；愁的是自己只念过二年书，连个初小都没毕业，怎么能作人民教师？公社党委书记任占保、生产队党支部书记叶增宽鼓励他：天下无难事，只怕有心人，路是人走出来的，办法是人找到的。文化程度低，只要自己努力，就可以提高。贾仲高想：听党的话就能进步，听党的话就能克服困难，他下定决心干下去。
    干下去，自然不会一帆风顺，贾仲高在干的过程当中，碰到无数次的困难，但是，他硬着头皮一一顶过去了。学校创办之初，底子薄，除了几孔破土窑洞以外，一无所有。自己动手修吧！当时还得兼任生产队会计，每天要到队里记账。怎么办呢？他想：事情刚开始，我难道还能被第一个困难吓倒？不能。他在党支部的支持下，领着几个大些的孩子，自己当大工，孩子当小工，开始补修窑洞，晚上回到生产队记账。那些日子，他天天带着满身泥浆回家，他父亲和爱人都埋怨说：人家教书是怎样教的，看你教书像个啥样子。他却说：只要做好党的事业，这算得了什么。两、三天以后，窑洞就修好了。窑洞修好以后，没有桌子、凳子和其他教学用具，还是上不成课。党支部书记领着他挨家逐户向群众说明办学的好处和困难，群众自动借出一些桌子和凳子。还不够。他就领着大些的孩子，用黄土泥成泥桌和泥凳。他怕孩子坐泥凳会着凉，就到野外捡些破麻袋、碎毡片包上。没有黑板，就用烟煤灰和黑豆水刷在墙上，代替黑板；没有粉笔，就用白土加水，再搓成长条，代替粉笔；孩子写字没有纸、笔，就用黄土磨成粉末，每人做个小木盘，将粉末放在里面，孩子在上面学习写算。就这样，一文钱没有花的民办初级小学，在金马驹偏僻的山沟里诞生了。
    学校办起来以后，贾仲高又面临着新的困难，开始教课时，他拿起书，哎哟！别说讲课，连字还识不全呢！他走上讲台，讲上三、五分钟，就没话讲了。他想：不克服这个困难，就不可能教好书，党的工作还是做不好。他下定决心苦学苦钻。在公社党委的具体帮助下，每星期日都到十五里外的冯庄小学去向人家请教；又参加冯庄小学函授学校学习；平时，他碰到不识的字和不懂的意思，就记下来，有识字的人到他那里去，他就拉住人家问；同时，公社党委书记任占保、生产队支部书记叶增宽亲自听他讲课，指出什么地方讲得好，什么地方讲得不好，更加鼓舞了他的信心。这时，他为了利用一切空余时间，集中精力备课，索性搬到学校来住。他白天给孩子上课，晚上学习，有时顾不上做饭，就一天吃一顿，后来，生产队党支部和社员知道了，就送饭来给他吃。经过这样艰苦学习，他现在已经具备了高中文化程度，并能看懂毛泽东选集。教课质量也获得显著提高，五十三个学生学习成绩很好，极大部分成绩都是四分五分。一年级孩子已达到四会：会认、会写、会算、会用。
    贾仲高不仅克服了重重困难，办起了学校，还坚持贯彻了党的劳动与教育相结合的方针。几年以来，公社党委先后拨给学校四亩多地，他自己领着大的孩子开了五、六亩荒地。社员群众热情支持学校，主动送了鸡、兔、羊给学校。贾仲高把这些当作教学的场所，讲课时，有些可以在现场教学的，如庄稼怎样长？鸡怎样喂等等，他就在现场教学。他还把这些当作孩子的劳动场所，大些的孩子每天坚持一小时左右的劳动，小些的孩子也规定一定的时间喂鸡、喂兔，这样既教好了孩子，也增加了学校的收入。今年，南瓜、药材、鸡蛋等等，就卖得三百多元。贾仲高利用这些钱给孩子买了书、纸、笔、小皮球、双杠等等。孩子参加劳动以后养成了热爱劳动的优秀品质。社员群众普遍反映说：贾家娃娃（指贾仲高）不愧是毛主席教养出来的好老师，把咱娃娃都管好了。”
    贾仲高非常热爱教育事业。几年以来，他除去开会以外，从没有离开学校一步。对于学校里的孩子，他总是用一颗慈母的心去体贴他们。由于孩子住家较远，还要翻过山岭，他怕小些的孩子走不了，就背着送回家，一到刮风下雨，他就背得更多。今年夏季的一天，下了一场暴雨，河水陡涨二尺，四十多个孩子都要过河才能回家，他不放心孩子自己过河，就背一个，抱一个，就这样，把四十多个孩子一一送过了河。孩子左拴朗生了病，他把孩子背回家，孩子的家长因为忙着干活，一时照顾不了，他跑到十多里外去请医生、买药，感动得孩子和家长热泪盈眶。中午，有些路远的孩子不回家，他就给孩子洗脸、洗手、熬米汤。由于贾仲高热爱孩子，许多家长把一些没有到学龄的幼儿送到学校来，要求贾仲高帮助照看，贾仲高虽然工作很忙，但仍旧欣然答允了家长的要求，将十一个幼儿组成了个幼儿班。
    现在，金马驹小学已被评为参加今年全国文教群英会的先进集体单位，成为全国民办小学的一面红旗。原先埋怨贾仲高的父亲和爱人懂得贾仲高一心一意为集体，这下不仅不埋怨了，还主动帮助贾仲高。
