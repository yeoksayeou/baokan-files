Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th. Steel workers on the Shanghai steel front, on the basis of a substantial increase in steel production in October, continue to forge ahead courageously. Everyone is united as one to launch a new high tide of production to fight hard for the last two months and strive to complete and exceed the state plan for this year ahead of schedule. In the first ten days of November, the daily output of steel broke the highest record since the beginning of this year, and the ten-day output also reached the highest ten-day output level since the beginning of this year.

Shanghai's steel production in October was the highest month this year. According to the annual plan requirements, the production tasks for November and December are heavier, and the daily production level is required to increase further than in October. As early as the end of October, the Party committees of various steel plants comprehensively analyzed the situation of steel production in November to the workers, and carefully deployed the tasks for the last two months of this year, and implemented various indicators and measures at all levels, down to workshops, work sections, furnaces, and groups; all departments made careful preparations.

As soon as November began, a new situation of concerted efforts to increase steel production quickly emerged on the Shanghai steel front. All steel plants, from within the plant to outside the plant, from supply and sales, transportation to welfare departments, all focused on supporting the furnace front and went all out. In the last few days of the first ten days, the city's steel production has maintained a very high level, and the transportation tasks of pig iron, coke, lime, etc. are very heavy. The staff of the transportation department overcame all difficulties and did whatever the furnace front needed. Supply and sales transportation cadres of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant and Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant went to the workshops to work, dispatching on site, and sent people to closely contact stations and docks, organizing a one-stop collaboration from the dock, warehouse and other starting points to the furnace front, to achieve fast loading, unloading, and transportation, and deliver all kinds of materials to the workshop in time. At the end of last month and the beginning of this month, various factories concentrated their maintenance forces on the front line, carried out rush repairs on steelmaking equipment such as cupolas, converters, and open-hearth furnaces to ensure that more furnaces were put into production; at the same time, they strengthened the inspection and maintenance of normally operating equipment, striving to reduce or eliminate accidents, so that each furnace has a higher operating time. The Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant and the Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant have maintained more than 75% of the furnaces participating in production due to the implementation of "prevention" as the main focus and good maintenance work. Canteens, nurseries, bathhouses and other welfare departments of various factories have also further improved their work. These have created favorable conditions for the furnace front to seize high production.

With the full support of raw material supply, equipment maintenance, and life service departments, workers and cadres in various steelmaking workshops are even more enthusiastic and full of confidence. According to the task requirements of the last two months, they have checked and summarized their work experience, found key points, tapped potential, and improved and developed technical operations, production management, and political work. After learning twenty-five advanced experiences from various brother units in the Yangtze River basin, the workers of the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant learned twenty-five advanced experiences from Tianjin and other places, and then summarized a complete set of operating experience from charging, smelting to tapping and casting according to the characteristics of their own furnaces. According to its own characteristics, the No. 2 cupola workers in the Second Converter Workshop of this factory promoted the experience of "politically on the furnace front" and the "furnace contract system", so that the output, quality, and life of molten iron comprehensively exceeded the level of other furnaces in the same workshop. After the average furnace output of the six-ton converter in the First Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant reached eight and a half tons, it focused on the new production key point, started from greatly reducing sub-losses to increase the furnace output, and successively carried out four experimental furnaces, and explored a set of advanced operating experience. In the first ten days of November, it was fully promoted, so that the molten iron consumption per ton of steel in the first ten days was reduced by about 60 kilograms compared with October. The furnace output increased to more than nine tons. The workers of the Second Converter Workshop of this factory adopted new measures to shorten the charging time of each furnace of steel, so that the number of steelmaking furnaces per day of the converter quickly rose from about 130 furnaces to about 145 furnaces. As a result of grasping the key points and tapping potential, in the first ten days, several large converter workshops in the city had already reached the production level required by the December plan ahead of schedule.

In the new high tide of production, the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation among Shanghai steel workers has been further developed. Now, not only is it a work section or a workshop, but also large-scale cooperation has been carried out between factories and workshops. The melting rate of the cupola in the Third Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant is not fast. When the workers of the Second Converter Workshop of the same factory learned about it, although their own production tasks were also very heavy, they still selected more than 40 experienced foreman, furnace leaders, and workers to support them from the material yard to the furnace front. When they operated in front of the third converter furnace, the foreman acted as the furnace leader, and the furnace leader acted as the furnace front worker. The workers of the two workshops operated and discussed in front of the furnace, quickly solved the problem, and rapidly increased the melting rate.

During this period, the leading cadres of various factories and workshops continued to adhere to the front line of production, sharing weal and woe with the masses. Administrative, trade union, Communist Youth League and other organizations at all levels gave full play to their roles and solved many specific problems raised by the masses from different perspectives such as production and life. The Second Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant has been producing at a high level for several days, and the material yard is very tense. The workshop leaders went to the material yard and worked with the workers, participating in the pre-shift, mid-shift, and post-shift discussion meetings of the workers. The masses successively put forward more than 200 small problems that urgently needed to be solved in production, such as repairs and patches, and the workshop assigned special personnel to help solve them in time, which further improved the enthusiasm of the workers.

    奋战最后两月，力争提前超额完成全年任务
    上海钢产量跃上更高水平
    各部门一条心一股劲，协力支援炼钢炉前夺取高产
    新华社上海12日电　上海钢铁战线的职工，在取得10月份钢产量大幅度增长的基础上，继续奋勇向前，大家一条心、一股劲，掀起了奋战最后两月，争取提前和超额完成今年国家计划的生产新高
  潮。11月上旬，钢的日产量突破了今年以来的最高纪录，旬的产量
  也达到了今年以来的最高旬产水平。
    上海10月份的钢铁生产是今年以来最高的一月。按照全年计划要求，十一、十二两个月的生产任务更重，日产水平要求比10月份再提高。早在10月底，各钢铁厂党委就全面地向职工分析了11月份钢铁生产的形势，详细地部署了今年最后两个月的任务，把各项指标和措施，层层落实到车间、工段、炉子和小组；各部门都做了细致的准备工作。
    一跨进11月份，上海钢铁战线很快出现了一个齐心协力增产钢的新局面。各钢铁厂从厂内到厂外，从供销、运输到生活福利等部门，都以支援炉前为中心，全力以赴。上旬最后几天，全市钢产量一直保持着很高的水平，生铁、焦炭、石灰等的运输任务十分繁重。运输部门的职工战胜一切困难，做到了炉前需要什么就运什么。上钢一厂、上钢三厂的供销运输干部，纷纷下车间办公，在现场调度，并且派人和车站、码头密切联系，组织从码头、仓库等起货地点到炉前的一条龙大协作，做到快装、快卸、快运，把各种物资及时送到车间。上月底和本月初，各厂集中了检修力量在第一线，突击检修了化铁炉、转炉和平炉等炼钢设备，保证有更多的炉子投入生产；同时加强了对运转正常的设备的检查和维护，力求减少事故或不出事故，使每只炉子有较高的作业时间。上钢一厂的第二转炉车间和上钢三厂的第二转炉车间，由于执行了以“防”为主，保养维护工作做得好，一直保持有75％以上的炉子参加生产。各厂食堂、托儿所、浴室等生活福利部门，也都进一步改进了自己的工作。这些都为炉前夺取高产创造了有利条件。
    在原材料供应、设备检修以及生活服务等部门的全力支援下，各炼钢车间的工人和干部，更是干劲十足，信心百倍。他们都根据最后两个月的任务要求，检查总结了自己的工作经验，找关键，挖潜力，使技术操作、生产管理和政治工作，都有了提高和发展。上钢一厂平炉车间职工从长江流域各个兄弟单位学来了二十五条先进经验后，又去天津等地学来了二十五条先进经验，然后根据自己炉子的特点，从加料、冶炼到放钢、浇铸各个环节，都总结出一套完整的操作经验。这个厂的第二转炉车间二号化铁炉工人根据本身特点，推行“政治上炉前”和“包炉制”的经验，使铁水的产量、质量和炉子的寿命全面超过了同车间其它炉子的水平。上钢三厂第一转炉车间的工人，在六吨转炉平均炉产量达到八吨半以后，又针对新的生产关键，从大力降低次损着手来提高炉产量，接连搞了四只试验炉，摸索出一套先进的操作经验，11月上旬全面地推广，使上旬每吨钢的铁水耗用量比10月份又降低了六十公斤左右。炉产量提高到九吨多。这个厂的第二转炉车间职工，采取新的措施缩短了每炉钢的加料时间，使转炉每天炼钢的炉数，从一百三十炉左右迅速上升到一百四十五炉左右。这样抓关键挖潜力的结果，上旬有几天，全市几个大型转炉车间已经提前达到了12月份计划要求的生产水平。
    上海钢铁工人在生产新高潮中，互助协作精神又进一步发扬。现在，不仅是一个工段、一个车间，而且厂与厂、车间与车间之间也开展了大协作。上钢一厂三转炉车间化铁炉熔化率不快，同厂的第二转炉车间工人知道了，虽然他们自己生产任务也很重，还是从料场到炉前挑选了四十多个有经验的工长、炉长和工人去支援。他们在三转炉炉前操作时，工长当炉长，炉长当炉前工。两个车间的工人在炉前边操作，边议论，很快解决了问题，迅速提高了熔化率。
    这一时期，各厂、各车间领导干部继续坚持深入生产第一线，和群众同甘共苦。行政、工会、共青团等各级组织充分发挥作用，从生产、生活等不同角度踏踏实实地解决群众提出来的许多具体问题。上钢三厂第二转炉车间，连日高产，料场工作很紧张，车间领导就到料场和工人一道劳动，参加工人的班前、班中、班后议论会。群众在议论会上陆续提出了二百多条生产中亟待解决的修修补补等小问题，车间都指派专人及时帮助解决，更加提高了工人群众的积极性。
