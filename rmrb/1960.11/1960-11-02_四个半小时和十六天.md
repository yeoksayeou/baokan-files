    Four and a Half Hours and Sixteen Days
    Overhauling a Liberation brand automobile, from disassembly to cleaning, inspection, and installation, used to take about twenty days. Now it only takes four hours and twenty-five minutes. This is a new record for automobile overhauls created by the First Automobile Team of the Shenyang Transportation Company.
    The Shenyang Transportation Company's planned quota for automobile overhauls was sixteen days. In the past, the First Team often exceeded the planned time due to the long time required for replacing parts. The long overhaul time meant that cars had to stay in the repair shop for twenty days or so, affecting vehicle deployment.
    In July, the output of the First Automobile Team rose daily. Before the end of the month, the team's ton-kilometers exceeded 10,000, but maintenance became a weak link, with a dispatch rate of only 80%. Therefore, the First Automobile Team's Party General Branch mobilized maintenance workers to solve the problem of automobile overhauls and shorten the overhaul time using revolutionary methods. After everyone's research and discussion, the staff proposed adopting a combination of "total assembly part exchange" and "on-vehicle repair," as well as parallel operations, estimating that it would take only five hours to overhaul a vehicle. The result of the first experiment was that it was completed in only four hours and twenty-five minutes. Efficiency was increased more than eightyfold.

    四个半小时和十六天
    大修一台解放牌汽车从拆卸到清洗、检查、安装，过去需要二十天左右，现在只用四小时二十五分。这是沈阳市运输公司第一汽车队创造的汽车大修新纪录。
    沈阳市运输公司规定的汽车大修时间计划定额是十六天，过去第一车队往往因部件拆换时间长，超过计划时间。大修时间长，汽车开进修理厂就要住二十来天，影响出车。
    7月份，汽车一队产量逐日上升，不到月底全队车吨产量就超过万吨公里，而检修就成了薄弱环节，出车率只有80％。因此第一汽车队党总支便发动检修工人，用革命的方法来解决汽车大修，缩短大修的时间。经过大家研究讨论，职工们提出采用“总承部分互换”和“就车修复”相结合，以及平行作业的方法，预计用五小时就可检修一台车。进行第一次试验的结果，只用四小时二十五分就完成了。效率提高八十多倍。
