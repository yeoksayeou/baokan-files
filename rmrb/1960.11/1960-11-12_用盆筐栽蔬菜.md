    Growing Vegetables in Pots and Baskets
    The Party committee of our Penpu Commune has called on all commune members to use old utensils such as pots, bowls, and baskets to grow vegetables in winter. In order to turn this call into practical action by commune members, the commune Party committee held a pot vegetable competition and exhibition. Through the exhibition, the ideological concerns of commune members, such as fear of trouble and fear of wasting effort, were dispelled, and the techniques of growing vegetables in pots and baskets were taught. Zhu Rizhi, a cadre of the Xiyuan branch, said after visiting the exhibition: In the past, I thought that growing vegetables in pots and baskets would not grow well, but after seeing the exhibition, my doubts were dispelled, and I must plant more when I go back. Now, more than 1,400 households in the commune have used pots, baskets, etc. to grow vegetables in more than 2,400 mounds, equivalent to the area of three mu of vegetable land.

    用盆筐栽蔬菜
    我们湓浦公社的党委号召全社社员利用盆、钵、筐等破旧器具在冬季栽培蔬菜。为了使这个号召变成社员的实际行动，公社党委举办了一个盆菜评比展览会。通过展览会，解除了社员怕麻烦、怕白费力等思想顾虑，并且传授了盆筐种菜的技术。西元分社干部朱日枝参观展览以后说：过去我认为利用盆盆筐筐种菜长不好，看了展览消除了我的怀疑，回去一定要多种。现在，全社已有一千四百多户利用盆、筐等种菜二千四百墩，等于三亩菜地的面积。
