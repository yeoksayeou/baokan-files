Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th. The Kaizhang People's Commune Committee in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, in leading production, has actively promoted the policy of combining work and rest, fully mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of commune members. This has led to a situation where the entire commune has high attendance rates, high labor efficiency, high quality, and good rest, good study, and good health.

The effect of Kaizhang Commune's implementation of the work-rest combination system is very significant. From July to September this year, the labor attendance rate of the commune's 8,568 members reached 96.2%, and the average monthly attendance per person increased by 12.8% compared to last year; labor efficiency increased by 40% compared to last year; the number of people in the commune exceeding labor quotas accounted for 33.1% of the total labor force, an increase of 13.6% compared to last year. Due to the significant improvement in labor attendance rate and work efficiency, the amount of labor used for the commune's more than 90,000 mu of autumn fields increased by an average of more than three compared to last year. At the same time, it also ensured that the commune's cotton and autumn grain still achieved increased production in the face of this year's severe drought.

Kaizhang Commune has vast land and a small population, with each laborer responsible for cultivating eighteen mu. Most of the land is dry land, with poor water conservancy conditions, and saline-alkali land accounting for more than one-third of the arable land. In times of drought, multiple sowings are required to obtain full seedlings. From crop sowing to harvesting, in addition to the labor used for field management, natural disasters cause a lot of extra labor burden. However, the commune party committee believes that as long as labor is organized reasonably and the labor enthusiasm of commune members is fully mobilized, it is possible to overcome drought and complete various production tasks. They also realized that the greater the enthusiasm of commune members, the more attention should be paid to their rest. Therefore, in leading production, they pay close attention to ensuring that commune members have both work and rest, and labor rhythmically.

The main experiences of this commune in implementing the combination of work and rest are to resolutely implement the rest system according to the principle of less rest during busy farming seasons and more rest during slack farming seasons: First, ensure that male and female commune members have a few days off each month. During holidays, cadres take turns cooking in the canteen in shifts to ensure that even cooks can get rest. Second, ensure that commune members sleep for eight hours a day, work for eight to ten hours, and spend the remaining time eating, resting, and studying. Third, reduce meetings to ensure that meetings do not affect commune members' rest. Fourth, assign farm work according to commune members' physical strength and specialties, and make appropriate adjustments to light and heavy work to allow commune members to restore their physical strength and work rhythmically.

Recently, the commune party committee has also made specific arrangements for commune members' winter production and rest, based on the fact that commune members worked a lot in the previous stage and there is less farm work at present. It is strictly stipulated that the daily working time generally does not exceed six hours, and under the condition of not affecting production, more light work and less heavy work should be done, so that commune members can have a good life and rest well in winter, so as to conserve energy and prepare for next year's spring plowing production.

    有劳有逸  兵强马壮
    山西开张公社推行劳逸结合四项办法
    社员出勤率高、工效高、休息好、身体好
    新华社太原16日电　山西省运城县开张人民公社党委在领导生产中，积极推行有劳有逸的政策，充分调动了社员的劳动积极性，使全社出现了出勤率高、劳动工效高、质量高和休息好、学习好、身体好的局面。
    开张公社贯彻执行劳逸结合制度的效果是非常显著的，今年7至9月份，全社八千五百六十八个社员的劳动出勤率达96.2％，每人每月平均出勤比去年提高12.8％；劳动效率比去年提高了40％；全社超过劳动定额的人数占总劳动力的33.1％，比去年增加了13.6％；由于劳动出勤率和工效有显著的提高，全社九万多亩秋田的用工量，平均比去年增加三个以上。同时，也保证了全社的棉花和秋粮在今年特大旱灾的情况下，仍然获得了增产。
    开张公社土地宽阔，人口少，每个劳力要担负十八亩的耕耘任务，大部是旱地，水利条件较差，可耕地中盐碱地占三分之一多，天旱时多次播种才能获得全苗，从作物播种到收获，除田间管理的用工外，因自然灾害造成劳力的额外负担很多。但是公社党委认为，只要合理组织劳力，充分调动社员的劳动积极性，是能够战胜干旱完成各种生产任务的，同时也认识到，社员的干劲越大，越要照顾社员休息，所以在领导生产中十分注意社员有劳有逸，有节奏的劳动。
    这个公社实行劳逸结合的主要经验是，根据农忙少休息，农闲多休息的原则，坚决实行休息制度：一、保证每月男女社员放几天假。放假期间干部分班轮流到食堂做饭，保证连炊事人员也可得到休息。二、保证社员每天睡足八小时，劳动八到十小时，其余时间吃饭、休息、学习。三、减少会议，保证不因开会影响社员休息。四、根据社员的体力和特长分配农活，同时对轻活、重活进行适当的调剂，让社员恢复体力有节奏地进行劳动。
    最近，公社党委还根据前阶段社员干活多和当前农活少的情况，对社员的冬季生产和休息作了具体安排，严格规定一天的劳动时间一般不超过六小时，在不影响生产的情况下，多作轻活，少作重活，让社员冬季生活好、休息好，以便养精蓄锐，迎接明年春耕生产。
