Xinhua News Agency, 25th: In the production increase and thrift movement centered on grain and steel, construction enterprises across the country have universally launched a construction upsurge to engage in rapid construction, step up the construction of key projects and finishing projects. From the statistics showing the rapid increase in the completion rate in various places, it can be seen that this movement has achieved significant results.

According to recent statistics, the area completed by construction enterprises nationwide in the third quarter has greatly exceeded the figures for the first or second quarters. Among them, the completed area of many units has approached or exceeded the sum of the completed area of the unit in the first half of the year. Construction enterprises in Hunan, Henan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Shenyang and other provinces and cities have achieved very significant results in this regard.

In order to ensure that construction projects related to grain and steel production are completed and put into production quickly, construction workers across the country have launched a labor competition since the third quarter. Leading cadres and functional personnel of many construction enterprises have gone to the front line of production, living, eating, working and discussing with workers to understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner. At the same time, under the leadership of local party committees, construction enterprises in various places, together with various relevant departments, reviewed this year's construction projects one by one, and listed projects that promote steel production such as mines, smelting, coal, electricity, and transportation, and projects that support agriculture such as chemical industry, nitrogen fertilizer, and tractors as key construction projects. Construction enterprises in various places have regarded the completion of these key projects as their central task in their actual work. For example, since the third quarter, Beijing has listed more than a dozen key projects such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Agricultural Machinery Plant, as well as staff dormitories and auxiliary facilities supporting these projects, as the primary tasks of the construction department in the next few months. Among the workload completed by the Shanghai Construction Engineering Bureau in August and September, the workload of key projects accounted for more than 60%.

In recent months, construction enterprises in various places have made full preparations around key projects, and have prepared manpower, materials, machinery and transportation forces for key projects. For example, Guangzhou has concentrated more than half of its construction force on key projects and finishing projects. On the construction site of the first phase of the Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant alone, there were more than 3,000 workers concentrated, and more than 400 trucks of materials and equipment were transported in every day. Therefore, the construction of this project with an area of more than 30,000 square meters started in late July and was completed in mid-September. The experience of many other construction enterprises in other regions has also proved that making full preparations and concentrating the use of forces is an important measure to enable key projects to be completed quickly.

Many regions have also strengthened organizational leadership and adjusted labor organizations according to the requirements of rapid construction. Heilongjiang Province has established command posts at all levels from the province and city to the prefecture construction company. Under the leadership of the municipal party committee, Shenyang established 22 joint party committees participated by both construction units and construction units, which played a great role in concentrating forces, organizing collaboration, and solving key problems in construction. According to the experience of the 404 construction site of the Sixth Construction Company, Beijing reorganized the original many professional groups into construction teams with workers of multiple trades in terms of labor organization. This kind of team is more flexible and adaptable to the requirements of rapid construction than the original professional groups. Shaanxi, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan and other places promoted the "three-line construction" experience created by Xi'an, changing the original method of organizing mixed construction with construction sites as units into three comprehensive teams of foundation, main body, and finishing according to regions, and carrying out large-scale assembly line operation under the premise of implementing regional centralized management. Practice in various places has proved that the main advantage of this method is that there are fixed teams responsible for everything from the foundation to the completion, which is conducive to improving the completion rate; at the same time, because people and machinery are fixed, it is also conducive to giving play to the effectiveness of machinery.

### 力争同粮、钢有关的重点建设项目尽早投入生产  建筑企业集中力量快速施工  广大职工开展竞赛领导干部深入第一线竣工率迅速上升

    力争同粮、钢有关的重点建设项目尽早投入生产
    建筑企业集中力量快速施工
    广大职工开展竞赛领导干部深入第一线竣工率迅速上升
    新华社25日讯　在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，全国建筑企业普遍掀起了一个大搞快速施工、加紧建设重点工程和收尾工程的施工高潮。从各地竣工率迅速上升的统计资料可以看出，这个运动已收到显著的效果。
    据最近统计，全国建筑企业第三季度竣工的面积，已大大超过了第一季或第二季的数字，其中许多单位的竣工面积，已接近或超过了本单位上半年竣工面积的总和。湖南、河南、陕西、云南，北京、上海、西安、沈阳等省市的建筑企业，在这方面都取得了很显著的成绩。
    为了保证和粮、钢生产有关的建设项目迅速建成投入生产，从第三季以来，全国建筑职工开展了劳动竞赛，许多建筑企业的领导干部和职能人员，都深入到生产第一线，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，及时了解情况和解决问题。同时，各建筑企业在当地党委领导下，和各个有关部门一道，对今年的建设项目，逐项地进行了审查，把矿山、冶炼、煤炭、电力、运输等促进钢铁生产的项目，和化工、氮肥、拖拉机等支援农业的项目列为建设重点。各地建筑企业都在实际工作中把完成这些重点项目，当成自己的中心任务。例如，从第三季以来，北京市就把石景山钢铁厂、农业机械厂等十几个重点工程和职工宿舍以及与这些工程配套的附属设施，列为建筑部门今后几个月的首要任务。上海市建工局8、9月份完成的工作量当中，重点工程的工作量就占了60％以上。
    最近几个月，各地建筑企业都围绕重点工程进行了充分的准备工作，给重点工程准备了人力、材料、机械和运输力量。例如，广州市就把一半以上的施工力量集中用在重点工程和收尾工程上，仅广州氮肥厂第一期工程一个工地，集中的工人就有三千多名，每天运进的物资器材达四百多车。因此，这个三万多平方米的工程，从7月下旬开工，到9月中旬，土建工程就完工了。其他地区许多建筑企业的经验也证明，做好充分准备，集中使用力量，是能够使重点工程迅速竣工的一项重要措施。
    很多地区还根据快速施工的要求，加强了组织领导和调整了劳动组织。黑龙江省从省、市到专区建筑公司逐级成立了指挥部。沈阳市在市委领导下，成立了二十二个由建设单位和施工单位双方参加的联合党委，对集中力量、组织协作、解决施工中的关键问题起了很大作用。北京市根据第六建筑公司四○四工地的经验，在劳动组织方面把原来的许多专业小组改编为有多工种工人参加的施工大队，这种大队比原来的专业小组机动灵活，能更加适应快速施工的要求。陕西、河南、湖南、四川等地推广了西安市创造的“三线施工”经验，把原来以工地为单位组织混合施工的方法，改为按区域组成基础、主体、收尾三个综合大队，在实行区域集中管理的前提下，进行大流水作业的施工方法。各地的实践证明，这种方法的主要优点是从基础到竣工，都有固定的队组负责，有利于提高竣工率；同时，由于人和机具固定，也有利于发挥机具的效能。
