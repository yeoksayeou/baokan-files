Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 7th - The Lao Fighting Forces Radio today broadcast a letter from Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, to the "Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and National Unification," expressing warm welcome for the establishment of this committee and calling on all Lao people to join this organization and struggle for a peaceful, neutral, harmonious and unified nation.

This committee was announced on October 31st at a meeting in Vientiane by representatives of various Lao political parties and mass organizations, as well as non-partisan figures. Prince Souphanouvong and Lao Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma were elected as honorary chairmen of the committee. In his letter to the committee, Prince Souphanouvong said, "Since the signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords, the Lao people's struggle for peace, neutrality, democracy, national harmony, and a unified nation has grown stronger and has continuously achieved victories. However, American imperialism has been trying its best to support its reactionary pawns, plotting to turn Laos into its new-style colony and war base. Currently, American imperialism is using the Phoumi Nosavan group to carry out conspiracies to split Laos, expand and prolong the Lao civil war, attempting to eliminate the Lao people's revolutionary movement, and restore the dictatorial system of the so-called 'Committee for the Defense of National Interests' and the 'Party for Democratic Social Progress,' in order to use them as tools to realize the aggressive and war-mongering conspiracies of American imperialism.”

The letter pointed out, "Faced with this crisis threatening the fate of the country, the people of all ethnic groups and social strata, as well as patriotic parties who advocate peace, neutrality, national harmony, and national unification, have realized that they must unite into a strong whole to oppose the interference of American imperialism and crush the forces of the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group. Therefore, the establishment of the 'Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and National Unification' and its policy line are in line with the urgent needs of the country and the deep aspirations of the Lao people."

The letter pointed out, "The establishment of this committee also shows the world that the Lao people are determined to pursue a genuine policy of peace and neutrality, which will be supported by the people of all countries and peace-loving organizations in the world who have supported the just struggle of the Lao people. This is a major political victory for the Lao people."

Prince Souphanouvong said, "On behalf of the Lao Patriotic Front, I would like to express a warm welcome to the 'Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and National Unification.' The Lao Patriotic Front, which has always struggled tirelessly for the interests of the Lao nation, will guarantee to be the most active member of the 'Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and National Unification' and will resolutely implement the committee's policy line."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 5th - The Lao Fighting Forces Radio today published a commentary strongly condemning the heads of the reactionary "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" for intensifying their traitorous activities in various places, attempting to realize the conspiracies of American imperialism.

The commentary pointed out that some heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" are doing their best to undermine the negotiations between the Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Front. According to Vientiane public opinion, in the National Assembly, they are attempting to propose that Inpeng Souryalath replace Quinim Pholsena as the head of the Royal Government's negotiation delegation.

The commentary pointed out that everyone knows that Inpeng Souryalath is one of the heads of the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests." In the past, he committed many crimes against the people with Phoumi Nosavan, and he is an enemy of harmony between the Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Forces. Therefore, if Souryalath is replaced as the head of the Royal Government negotiation delegation, he will greatly undermine the current negotiations, which are proceeding in a spirit of mutual understanding.

The commentary also pointed out that the head (chairman) of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests," Van Rattikone, is using his position in the government in the First Military Region to put forward a false "peaceful neutral line," deceiving the people, and instigating some reactionary officers to attack the Lao Fighting Forces in Phongsaly, "sweep" and persecute the people.

The commentary reminded Lao patriots and peace-loving people to resolutely oppose all the conspiracies of the heads of the "Committee for the Defense of National Interests."

    苏发努冯欢迎老挝成立争取和平中立与统一国家组织
    号召人民加强团结反对美国干涉
    寮国战斗部队电台揭露反动势力阴谋破坏万象谈判
    新华社河内7日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王写给“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”的信，信中表示热烈欢迎这个委员会的成立，并号召全体老挝人民参加这个组织，为和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家而斗争。
    这个委员会是老挝各政党和群众组织的代表以及无党派人士10月31日在万象举行的会议上宣布成立的。老挝首相富马亲王和苏发努冯亲王当选为这个委员会的名誉主席。苏发努冯亲王在给这个委员会的信中说，“从1954年日内瓦协议签定以来，老挝人民为争取和平中立、民主、民族和睦、统一国家的斗争日益壮大，并不断地获得胜利。但是，美帝国主义却竭力扶植它的反动的走狗，阴谋把老挝变成它的新式殖民地和战争基地。目前，美帝国主义正在利用富米·诺萨万集团，进行分裂老挝、扩大和拖延老挝内战的阴谋，企图消灭老挝人民的革命运动，恢复所谓‘保卫国家利益委员会’和‘民主社会进步党’的独裁制度，以便作为实现美帝国主义的侵略和战争阴谋的工具。”
    信中指出，“面对着这种威胁国家命运的危机，各族、各阶层人民以及赞成和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的爱国政党已经认清必须团结成一个坚固的整体，来反对美帝国主义的干涉，粉碎富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的势力。因此，‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’的成立以及它的政策路线，是符合当前国家的迫切要求和老挝全国人民的深切愿望的。”
    信中指出，“这个委员会的成立还向全世界说明，老挝人民坚决奉行真正的和平中立政策，它将得到曾经支持老挝人民的正义斗争的各国人民和世界爱好和平组织的支持。这是老挝人民在政治上的重大的胜利。”
    苏发努冯亲王说，“我谨代表老挝爱国战线党向‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’表示热烈欢迎。一贯为老挝民族利益而进行不懈地斗争的老挝爱国战线党将保证成为‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’中最积极的成员，坚决实行委员会的政策路线。”
    新华社河内5日电　寮国战斗部队电台今日发表评论，强烈谴责反动的“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们，在各地加紧叛国活动，妄图实现美帝国主义的阴谋。
    评论指出，“保卫国家利益委员会”的一些头目们，正在竭力破坏王国政府同老挝爱国战线党之间的谈判。据万象舆论揭露，在国民议会里，他们企图提出以因彭·苏里亚泰代替贵宁·奔舍那担任王国政府谈判代表团团长。
    评论指出，大家知道，因彭·苏里亚泰是所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目之一，在过去期间，曾同富米·诺萨万一起犯下许多迫害人民罪行，他是王国政府同寮国战斗部队之间的和睦的敌人。因此，如果改由苏里亚泰担任王国政府谈判代表团团长，他必将大肆破坏目前正在互相谅解气氛中进行的谈判。
    评论还指出，“保卫国家利益委员会”头目（主席）万·拉迪功，正在第一军区利用他在政府中的地位提出虚假的“和平中立路线”，欺骗人民，唆使一些反动军官进攻丰沙里的寮国战斗部队，“扫荡”、迫害人民。
    评论提醒老挝爱国、爱和平人士坚决反对“保卫国家利益委员会”的头目们的一切阴谋。
