Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 4th: Marshal He Long, head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, and General Yang Yong, a member of the delegation, accompanied by Senior General Choi Yong-jin, Vice Minister of the National Defense of Korea, continued their sightseeing tour in Wonsan. Qiao Xiaoguang, the Chinese Ambassador to Korea, is also visiting Wonsan. General Luo Ruiqing and other members of the delegation, accompanied by Senior General Shi Shan, Vice Minister of National Defense of Korea, visited the famous scenic spot of Kumgangsan in Korea today.

Under the beautiful Crystal Peak of Kumgangsan, the delegation was warmly welcomed by thousands of people and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army. The masses held high the national flags of China and Korea and large bouquets of flowers. Slogans of "Long Live Marshal Kim Il-sung" and "Long Live Chairman Mao Zedong" and songs of "General Kim Il-sung's Song" and "The East is Red" rose one after another. A group of Young Pioneers dressed in brightly colored national costumes presented a wreath made of bright red flowers to General Luo Ruiqing. Another group of Young Pioneers presented large bouquets of flowers to the Chinese guests. Then, with four national flags of China and Korea leading the way, this group of Young Pioneers took the hands of the Chinese guests and walked through the welcoming crowd, which was about two *li* long. There were more than a dozen large banners in the welcoming crowd with slogans such as "Long live the militant friendship between the people's armies of China and Korea forged in blood!" The welcoming masses also draped countless ribbons over the Chinese guests. At the end of the welcoming line, the delegation pinned "August 1st" commemorative badges on the chests of the Young Pioneers. At this time, another team of welcoming people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army rushed to welcome the delegation. The deep friendship of the Korean people and the People's Army deeply moved the Chinese guests.

Comrades Wu Zhenyu, Ji Bingxue, Cui Minzhe, and Yin Zhihao, heads of the Kumgangsan area garrison of the Korean People's Army, came to welcome the delegation.

Also present to welcome the delegation were Kim Se-hwal, Vice Chairman of the Kangwon Province Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Kim Young-soon, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Committee, Kim In-jong, Chairman of the Kosong County Party Committee, and Zhao Ying-won, Chairman of the County People's Committee.

Today, the delegation also visited an artillery unit of the Korean People's Army and presented gifts to the unit.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 4th: The Kumgangsan area garrison of the Korean People's Army held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea.

General Luo Ruiqing, Deputy Head of the Delegation, and members of the delegation attended the banquet. Also attending the banquet were Senior General Shi Shan, Vice Minister of National Defense of Korea, who accompanied the delegation to Kumgangsan, Wu Zhenyu, Ji Bingxue, and Cui Minzhe, heads of the Kumgangsan area garrison of the Korean People's Army, as well as Kim Se-hwal, Vice Chairman of the Kangwon Province Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and Kim Young-soon, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Committee.

Colonel Zhang Leting, Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, also attended the banquet.

At the banquet, Comrade Wu Zhenyu delivered a speech first. He said that the people of Korea and China are the closest friendly neighbors. In the 1930s, our militant friendship was forged in blood in the long struggle against a common enemy. During the more than three years of the Korean War against the American imperialist aggressors, the traditional friendship and solidarity between our two peoples were further strengthened. Whenever we think of the past years when we fought shoulder to shoulder with our Chinese brothers, helping and encouraging each other, in a common struggle against the fierce enemy, we cannot forget the friendship of our closest brothers.

Wu Zhenyu said that in our broad mountains and rivers, there are everywhere the noble kindness and great achievements left by our Chinese brothers. This will be passed down through generations along with our history like legends. Today, the people and officers and soldiers of our People's Army cherish the friendship and solidarity between the brotherly Chinese people and their army as they cherish the pupils of their own eyes, and are full of a firm will to forever consolidate and develop this friendship.

Wu Zhenyu said: Our people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army, with the continuous support and assistance of hundreds of millions of people in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will certainly achieve victory in our great revolutionary cause under the correct leadership of our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers' Party, and will gloriously defend the eastern outpost of the socialist camp, forever loyal to proletarian internationalism.

Then, General Luo Ruiqing delivered a speech. He said that you are a heroic unit of the Korean People's Army. In the sacred Fatherland Liberation War, you highly developed the heroic spirit of fearless proletarian warriors, defeated the American invading army with its absolute advantage in technology and equipment, and created earth-shattering achievements. With your own iron hands, you exposed the paper tiger nature of the American invaders, greatly inspiring the fighting confidence of the oppressed nations of the world. Since the Korean armistice, you have been vigilantly guarding the northern end of the military demarcation line, on the eastern front of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, day after day for seven years. You have effectively combatted the American imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the Korean armistice and rekindle the flames of aggressive war, maintained the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and safeguarded the security of your country and peace in the Far East and the world.

General Luo Ruiqing said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army feels sincere joy for every achievement made by the Korean People's Army. We feel infinitely honored and proud to have such a heroic fraternal army. General Luo Ruiqing emphasized that the common struggle against imperialist aggression, to defend the security of our countries, and to strive for the reunification of our homelands, and the common ideals of building socialism and communism, have forever and firmly bound us together. The militant friendship and solidarity between us, forged in blood, cannot be undermined by any force in the world.

General Luo Ruiqing pointed out that China and Korea, like all socialist countries, love peace and will do their utmost to maintain lasting peace. However, if the American imperialists dare to invade us again, then the people of China and Korea, who are as close as lips and teeth and as inseparable as flesh and blood, will once again join hands and fight side by side to defend our common security and common interests, and completely and thoroughly wipe out the enemy who dares to attack.

General Luo Ruiqing finally said that the great unity of the people of China and Korea is an invincible force. In front of it, any enemy will be smashed to pieces and suffer a shameful defeat. Let the people and armies of our two countries stand together forever, and the final victory will surely be ours.

The banquet proceeded in a warm atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 4th: All the officers and soldiers of the Kumgangsan area garrison of the Korean People's Army today presented the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea with precious gifts - a silk banner and an embroidered painting.

Comrade Wu Zhenyu, the head of this unit, personally presented the gifts to General Luo Ruiqing, Deputy Head of the Delegation. The front of this silk banner is embroidered with four large golden characters "Korea-China Friendship," and the back is embroidered with "Long Live the Militant Friendship between the People's Armies of China and Korea Forged in Blood."

The embroidered painting depicts a scene of soldiers from China and Korea cheering enthusiastically together for the victory of the battle.

The Chinese delegation also presented the unit with gifts such as the emblem of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    新华社平壤4日电　中国访朝军事友好代表团团长贺龙元帅和团员杨勇上将由朝鲜民族保卫省副相崔勇进上将陪同，继续在元山参观访问。中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光也在元山参观访问。罗瑞卿大将和代表团其他成员在朝鲜民族保卫省副相石山上将陪同下，今天到朝鲜著名胜地金刚山参观游览。
    在金刚山秀丽的水晶峰下，代表团受到了数千群众和朝鲜人民军官兵的热烈的夹道欢迎。群众高举朝中两国国旗和大束的鲜花。“金日成元帅万岁”、“毛泽东主席万岁”的口号声和“金日成将军之歌”“东方红”的歌声此伏彼起。一群穿着鲜艳的民族服装的少年团员将一个由鲜艳的红花扎成的花环敬献给罗瑞卿大将。另一群少年团员又将大束大束的鲜花献给中国客人。然后，由四杆朝中两国国旗在前面开路，这群少年团员拉着中国客人的手穿过约两华里长的欢迎行列。欢迎行列里有十多条大幅标语，上面写着：“以鲜血凝成的朝中两国人民军队间的战斗友谊万岁”等口号。欢迎群众还将无数条彩带披在中国客人身上。到了欢迎行列的这一端，代表团将“八一”纪念章戴在少年团员的胸前。这时，另一队欢迎群众和人民军官兵赶来欢迎代表团。朝鲜人民和人民军的深情厚谊使中国客人深受感动。
    朝鲜人民军金刚山地区驻军首长吴镇宇同志、池炳学同志、崔民哲同志、尹治浩同志赶来欢迎代表团。
    前来欢迎代表团的还有，朝鲜劳动党江原道委员会副委员长金势活，道人民委员会副委员长金永淳，高城郡党委员会委员长金仁钟，郡人民委员会委员长赵应元等。

    新华社平壤4日电　朝鲜人民军金刚山地区驻军今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎中国访朝军事友好代表团。

    中国驻朝鲜大使馆武官张乐亭上校也参加了宴会。
    在宴会上，吴镇宇同志首先致词。他说，朝中两国人民是最亲近的友邻。在三十年代，我们的战斗友谊是在反对共同敌人的长期斗争中以鲜血凝成的。在反对美帝国主义侵略者的三年有余的朝鲜战争中，进一步加强了我们两国人民的传统友谊和团结。每当我们想起同中国兄弟们肩并肩、互相帮助、互相鼓励，为反对凶恶的敌人进行共同斗争的以往年月时，我们就忘不了最亲密的兄弟们的友情。
    吴镇宇说，在我国广阔的山河中，到处都有中国弟兄们留下的高贵恩情和丰功伟绩。这将同我们的历史一起像传说般地流传子孙万代。今天我国人民和人民军官兵们像爱惜自己眼珠一样地爱惜和弟兄般的中国人民和他们的军队之间的友谊团结，并且充满着永远巩固和发展这一友谊的坚定意志。
    吴镇宇说：我国人民和人民军官兵们在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭几亿人民的不断的声援和支持下，遵循我国人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅和朝鲜劳动党的正确领导，将一定会使我们革命的伟大事业取得胜利，并且光荣地捍卫社会主义阵营东方前哨，永远忠实于无产阶级国际主义。
    接着，罗瑞卿大将讲了话。他说，你们是朝鲜人民军的一支英雄的部队。在神圣的祖国解放战争中，你们高度发扬了大无畏的无产阶级勇士的英雄气概，打败了技术装备占绝对优势的美国侵略军，创造了惊天动地的战绩。你们用自己的铁手，拆穿了美国侵略者的纸老虎面目，极大地鼓舞了全世界被压迫民族的斗争信心。朝鲜停战以来，你们七年如一日地、始终警惕地守卫在军事分界线的北端，守卫在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的东方前线。你们有效地打击了美帝国主义妄图破坏朝鲜停战、重新燃起侵略战火的阴谋活动，维护了朝鲜停战协定的实施，维护了你们祖国的安全和远东与世界和平。
    罗瑞卿大将说，中国人民解放军对于朝鲜人民军所取得的每一个成就，都感到由衷的喜悦。我们为有这样一支英雄的兄弟军队而感到无尚光荣和骄傲。罗瑞卿大将着重指出，反对帝国主义侵略、保卫祖国安全、争取祖国统一的共同斗争和建设社会主义和共产主义的共同理想把我们永远地牢固地结合在一起。我们之间用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊和团结，是世界上任何力量都不能破坏的。
    罗瑞卿大将指出，我们中朝两国同所有社会主义国家一样都是热爱和平的，并将为维护持久和平而尽自己的最大努力。但是，美帝国主义者如果胆敢再来侵犯我们，那么，唇齿相依，血肉相连的中朝两国人民，为了保卫共同的安全和共同的利益，必将再一次携起手来，并肩作战，把敢于进攻的敌人彻底干净全部消灭掉。
    罗瑞卿大将最后说，中朝两国人民的伟大团结，是无敌的力量，在它面前，任何敌人都要碰得头破血流而遭到可耻的失败。让我们两国人民和军队永远地站在一起，最后胜利一定是我们的。
    宴会在热烈的气氛中进行。
