Xinhua News Agency, New York Dispatch: Recently, the following incident occurred in New York: Four Ghanaian and Somali university students inquired with a Washington building manager about how to get to Miss Kissenberry's place, who had invited them to a party, but they were rudely driven out.

In the United States, such things are too numerous to mention. Even the "New York Times," the mouthpiece of American monopoly capital, said that no one can deny that many Asian and African university students have extremely unpleasant and painful experiences due to discrimination they encounter throughout the United States.

Another American newspaper, the "Washington Post," admitted in an editorial that these university students, like most people in the world, have the impression that America's declarations about democracy and human equality are deceptive. "New York Times" commentator Kuhn pointed out that, as a result, many foreign university students have angrily left the United States and returned to their home countries.

While the American ruling clique subjects colored foreign students to racial discrimination and rude treatment, it also attempts to exploit them as much as possible in political struggles. Recently, the following incident occurred in the United States: A group of Kenyan university students tried to ask the State Department for help to transport them to their study locations by military transport aircraft. Initially, State Department officials firmly rejected their request. At this time, the American Democratic presidential candidate, the son of a billionaire, Kennedy, believed that he could use this opportunity to win black votes, so he suggested that his family help these students.

The Republican candidate, incumbent Vice President Nixon, was unwilling to be outdone, and through his assistant, he made the State Department suddenly agree to the demands of these African students.

The experiences of students from Asian, African, and Latin American countries in the United States have aroused indignation. It is reported that a group of foreign university students who went to Tennessee to visit industrial enterprises refused to continue their visit because white racists did not allow two Panamanian girls to enter a restaurant reserved for whites. Some Latin American university students said upon leaving an American university in Michigan that they had a strong aversion to the racists' behavior towards black people.

### 只因肤色不同　备受种族歧视  许多亚非和拉丁美洲学生愤然离美

    只因肤色不同　备受种族歧视
    许多亚非和拉丁美洲学生愤然离美
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：最近，纽约发生了这样一件事：四名加纳和索马里大学生询问华盛顿的房屋管理人，到邀请他们参加晚会的基森贝里小姐那儿去应该怎样走，但是他们却被粗暴地赶了出来。
    在美国，这类事情实在不胜枚举。连美国垄断资本的喉舌“纽约时报”也说，任何人也不能否认，许多亚非大学生由于在美国各地遭到歧视，有极不愉快的、痛苦的经验。
    另一家美国报纸“华盛顿邮报”在社论中承认，这些大学生，同世界各国大多数人一样有这样一个印象：美国关于民主和人类平等的声明是骗人的。“纽约时报”评论员库恩指出，因此，许多外国大学生都愤而离开美国回国。
    美国统治集团一方面使有色的留学生备受种族歧视和粗暴的待遇，另一方面又企图在政治争夺战中尽量利用他们。最近在美国就发生了这样的事情：一批怯尼亚大学生试图请国务院帮助，把他们用军用运输机送到学习地点去。最初，国务院官员坚决拒绝他们的要求。这时，美国民主党总统候选人、亿万富翁的儿子肯尼迪认为，他可以利用这个机会来骗取黑人选票，于是他建议由他的家族来帮助这些学生。
    共和党候选人、现任副总统尼克松也不甘落后，他通过自己的助手使国务院突然答应这些非洲学生的要求。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家留学生在美国的遭遇已经激起了人们的愤慨。据报道，一批去田纳西州参观工业企业的外国大学生因为白人种族主义者不允许两名巴拿马姑娘进入白人专用的饭店而拒绝继续参观。一些拉丁美洲大学生在离开密执安州的美国大学时说，对于种族主义者对黑人的行为，他们有强烈的反感。
