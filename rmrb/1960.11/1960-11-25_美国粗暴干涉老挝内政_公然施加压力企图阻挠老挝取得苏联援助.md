Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 24th: The United States Department of State has once again rudely interfered in the internal affairs of Laos, attempting to obstruct the Laotian government from obtaining Soviet aid.

The U.S. State Department spokesman, Mr. White, openly said on the 23rd that the United States "hopes that Laos will carefully consider the approach it appears they will take (of requesting Soviet aid)."

White also emphasized that the United States "has made its attitude on this issue clear to the Laotian government for approximately the past seven years." He added that "the U.S. Ambassador to Laos also reiterated the U.S. attitude in recent talks with the Phouma government."
