Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 27th: Hungary has been continuously adopting various measures to rationally and centrally use investment over the past three years, thereby accelerating the pace of basic construction. It is expected that by the end of this year, the basic construction tasks stipulated in the Three-Year Plan (1958-1960) will be greatly overfulfilled. To date, many newly built and expanded enterprises, such as the hot rolling mill and No. 4 open-hearth furnace of the Danube Iron and Steel Plant, the Pecs Thermal Power Station, the heavy metal foundry of the Csepel Iron and Steel Plant, and the Rudabanya ore dressing plant, have been put into production on schedule. In addition, the addition and updating of a large number of machines and equipment and the improvement of technological processes have also greatly increased production capacity and promoted the process of agricultural mechanization.

Over the past three years, Hungary has taken a series of measures based on its actual domestic conditions to ensure the smooth progress of basic construction work. The first is to concentrate the use of funds, raw materials, and labor to put investment projects into production as soon as possible. For example, this year's primary focus is on completing the basic construction projects that were not completed in 1959, followed by the construction projects that should be completed this year, so that the commencement of new projects accounts for only 4% to 5% of the total basic construction. This year, various regions have concentrated manpower and material resources to ensure the smooth progress of 120 major investment projects. To this end, the government has established a special institution for reviewing basic construction, and each investment has undergone rigorous review.

Secondly, the structure of industrial production, especially the machine manufacturing industry, has been adjusted through investment. Over the past three years, Hungary has given priority to the development of labor-saving, material-saving, technically sound, and export-oriented sectors such as telecommunications equipment, high-voltage equipment, diesel locomotives, and precision instruments. This has not only increased the production of export products that are beneficial to the country, but also made it possible for the state to concentrate funds used to develop industrial technology levels on the most important sectors first, so that the technical level of these industrial sectors can be rapidly developed. Therefore, foreign trade, which is of great significance to Hungary's national economy, has been greatly improved over the past three years.

Thirdly, the proportion of machinery investment in basic investment has increased year by year over the past three years, while the proportion of construction investment has decreased accordingly, implementing the policy of expanding production mainly by making full use of existing factories, and expanding and adding equipment when necessary. Last year, the construction part of the total investment accounted for 45.6%, which fell to 41.2% in the first half of this year; while the proportion of machinery investment increased from 38.3% to 43.7% during the same period. In the first half of this year, the number of machines put into production was 85% more than in the same period last year.

Fourthly, with the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, agricultural investment has continued to grow. In 1959, the proportion of agricultural investment in total investment increased by 6% compared with 1958. The agricultural machinery put into production in the first half of this year was equivalent to twice that of the same period last year, which greatly accelerated the mechanization of agriculture and promoted the consolidation and development of cooperatives.

### 采取各种措施　合理使用投资  匈牙利基本建设速度加快

    采取各种措施　合理使用投资
    匈牙利基本建设速度加快
    据新华社布达佩斯27日电　匈牙利最近三年来不断采取各种措施合理和集中地使用投资，从而加快了基本建设的速度。预计到今年年底，三年计划（1958—1960年）规定的基本建设任务将大大超额完成。到目前为止，多瑙钢铁厂的热轧钢厂和四号马丁炉、佩奇火力发电站、切佩尔钢铁厂的重金属铸造厂和鲁达巴尼选矿厂等很多新建和扩建的企业都已先后按期投入生产。另外还增添和更新了很多机器设备，改进了工艺过程，这也大大提高了生产能力，促进了农业机械化的进程。
    三年来，匈牙利根据国内的实际情况，采取一系列的措施，保证了基本建设工作的顺利进行，首先是集中使用资金、原料和劳动力，使投资项目尽快地投入生产。例如，今年首先是致力于完成1959年尚未结束的基本建设，其次是今年应当完成的建设项目，使新工程的开建，只占总的基本建设的4％到5％。今年各地集中人力、物力保证了一百二十项主要投资项目的顺利进行。政府为此成立了专门审核基本建设的机构，每项投资都经过了严格的审查。
    其次，通过投资调整了工业生产的结构，特别是机器制造业。三年来匈牙利优先发展了费工省料、有技术条件基础和出口的电讯器材、高电压设备、柴油机车和精密仪器等部门。这不仅增加了对本国有利的出口产品的生产数量，而且有可能使国家把用于发展工业技术水平的资金首先集中使用于最重要的部门，使这些工业部门的技术水平得到迅速的发展。因此，三年来对匈牙利国民经济有着重要意义的对外贸易得到了很大的改善。
    第三，三年来基本投资中机器投资的比例逐年增长，而建筑投资的比例则相应减少，贯彻了扩大生产主要依靠充分利用现有工厂，必要时加以扩建、增添设备的方针。去年总投资中的建筑部分占45.6％，今年上半年下降到41.2％；而机器投资的比例在同时期内却由38.3％提高到43.7％。在今年上半年内，投入生产的机器比去年同时期多85％。
    第四，随着农业合作化运动的迅速发展，农业投资不断增长。1959年农业投资在总投资中所占的比例比1958年提高了6％。今年上半年投入生产的农业机器相当于去年同时期的两倍，这样就大大加快了农业的机械化，促进了合作社的巩固和发展。
