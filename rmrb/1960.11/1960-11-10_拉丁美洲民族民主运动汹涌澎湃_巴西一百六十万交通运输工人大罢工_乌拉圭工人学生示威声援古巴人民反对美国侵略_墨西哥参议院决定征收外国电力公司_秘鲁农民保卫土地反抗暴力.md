Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 8th: One million six hundred thousand maritime, railway, and dock workers throughout Brazil began a general strike this morning, demanding that Congress immediately pass a bill granting non-military state employees the same wage benefits as military personnel.

    This massive strike has paralyzed ports and railways throughout the country. Strikers also held demonstrations, holding aloft signs demanding land reform and "Yankee Murderers Get Out of Cuba!"
    The strike is supported by unions of bank employees, aviation workers, postal and telecommunications workers, and the National Student Union.
    President Kubitschek convened a cabinet meeting and declared the strike illegal. The government also threatened to dismiss employees who did not return to work by the 9th and conduct administrative investigations. In addition, helmeted and armed troops controlled all major railway stations and ports in Rio de Janeiro, and military police occupied power plants and reservoirs. The Navy was sent to take over ferries from Rio de Janeiro to the neighboring city of Niterói. Emergency measures were taken at all airports and border posts. It is reported that in Rio de Janeiro alone, authorities have already arrested two hundred striking workers.

    Nevertheless, unions participating in the strike stated that the strike will continue until the workers' demands are met.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Montevideo dispatch: Several thousand Uruguayan tobacco workers, construction workers, metallurgical workers, dockworkers, and students held a demonstration march on the main streets of Montevideo on the evening of the 8th, demanding the establishment of a national minimum wage system, a reasonable education budget for universities, and expressing support for the Cuban people's struggle against imperialist aggression.

    Like recent demonstrations, demonstrators strongly condemned the government's subservience to the policies of the U.S.-controlled International Monetary Fund and the suppression of the people's movement.

    After the demonstration march, a mass rally was held in front of the Parliament Building.

    Representatives of the Uruguayan Workers' United Union and the tobacco workers, port workers, construction workers, and student unions, in their speeches, unanimously criticized the government's policies and condemned the U.S. imperialist plot to invade Cuba.

    Representatives of workers and students declared that the Uruguayan people will respond to any armed aggression against Cuba by immediately ceasing all activities and taking other vigorous actions.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to a TASS dispatch from Mexico City on the 5th: The Mexican Senate unanimously passed a decree nationalizing the electric power industry.

    The Mexican government nationalized the U.S. electric power company "American and Foreign Power Company" this April, and purchased shares of "Mexican Light and Power Company," formerly owned by Belgian, Canadian, American, and British capital, in September. Therefore, now almost 100 percent of Mexico's electricity production and distribution is under government control.

Xinhua News Agency, Lima, 1st: On October 30th, in the Yanacala area of Ayabaca province, Peru, violent clashes occurred between police and peasants, resulting in one peasant death and dozens injured. The clashes occurred when police attempted to forcibly evict peasants from land on the San Rosa and Cujaca estates. Recently, the peasants there were forced to leave their homes and farms, but they reoccupied them. This time, the peasants resisted the police who were trying to drive them off the land with hoes and other tools. It is reported that approximately three thousand peasants participated in the struggle. Some peasants were seriously injured. Under the peasants' strong resistance, the police sent to suppress them suffered a major blow. Police Lieutenant Colonel Carrillo was also seriously injured.

    墨西哥参议院决定征收外国电力公司　秘鲁农民保卫土地反抗暴力
    据新华社里约热内卢8日电巴西各地一百六十万海运、铁路和码头工人今天上午举行大罢工，要求国会立即通过一项法案，使国家非军事工作人员享有同军事人员同等的工资待遇。
    这次声势浩大的罢工使各地的港口和铁路陷于瘫痪。罢工者还举行了示威，高举着要求实行土地改革以及“美国刽子手滚出古巴！”的标语牌。
    罢工得到银行职工、航空工人和邮电工人工会与全国学生联合会的支持。
    库比契克总统召集了内阁会议，宣布罢工为非法。政府还扬言要解除到9日还不复工的职工的职务，并进行行政调查。此外，头戴钢盔手执武器的军队控制着里约热内卢所有主要的火车站和港口，宪警占领了发电站和水库。海军被派出接管了从里约热内卢到邻城尼蒂罗伊的渡船。在所有机场和国境哨都采取了紧急措施。据悉，在里约热内卢一地，当局已经逮捕了二百名罢工工人。
    尽管如此，参加罢工的工会表示，罢工将继续进行到工人们的要求得到满足时为止。
    新华社9日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：几千名乌拉圭烟草工人、建筑工人、冶金工人、码头工人和学生8日晚间在蒙得维的亚主要的大街上举行示威游行，要求建立全国最低工资制，给予大学合理的教育预算，并且声援古巴人民反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。
    像最近的历次示威一样，示威者强烈谴责政府屈从美国控制下的国际货币基金组织的政策和对人民运动的镇压。
    游行示威结束后，在议会大厦前举行了群众大会。
    乌拉圭工人统一工会和烟草工人、港口工人、建筑工人以及学生联合会的代表在讲话中，一致抨击政府的政策，并且谴责美帝国主义侵略古巴的阴谋。
    工人和学生的代表们宣布，乌拉圭人民将通过立即停止各种活动和采取其它有力的行动来回答任何对古巴的武装侵略。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城5日讯：墨西哥参议院一致通过了把电力工业国有化的法令。
    墨西哥政府今年4月已经把美国电力公司“美国国内外电力公司”收归国有，9月份又购买了曾经属于比利时、加拿大、美国和英国资本的“墨西哥电力公司”的股票。因此现在墨西哥几乎百分之百的电力生产和分配已置于政府控制下。
    据新华社利马1日电　10月30日，在秘鲁阿雅巴卡省的延卡拉地方，警察和农民发生暴力冲突，结果一名农民死亡，数十人受伤。这次冲突是在警察企图用武力把农民从圣罗萨和库哈卡一些庄园的土地上赶走时发生的。最近那里的农民被迫离开了自己的家和农庄，但是他们又重新占有了它们。这次农民用锄头等反抗企图把他们从土地上赶走的警察。据报道，大约有三千多农民参加了这次斗争。一些农民受了重伤。在农民强烈的反抗下，前往镇压的警察受到很大打击。警察部队的卡里略中校也受了重伤。
