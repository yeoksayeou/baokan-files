    Carefully Harvest Economic Crops
    Climbing Mountains and Entering Forests to Pick Oil Tea
    In the southern provinces' mountainous areas, woody oil crops such as oil tea, tung oil, and Chinese tallow trees are generally ripe and laden with fruit. Mountainous communes are organizing labor to climb mountains and enter forests for a concentrated harvest. Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other oil tea producing provinces have launched movements for careful and detailed harvesting, striving to "pick every tea tree clean and glean every plot of land." Some communes have also organized expeditions to remote mountainous areas to pick wild, scattered oil tea.
    While picking oil tea, oil pressing factories in various places are vigorously carrying out tool reforms to improve oil pressing efficiency.

    精摘细收经济作物
    登山入林摘油茶
    南方各省山区的油茶、油桐、乌柏等木本油料已普遍成熟，果实累累。山区公社正组织劳力登山入林突击采摘。湖南、江西、福建、浙江、广东等省的油茶产区都开展了精收细摘运动，力争“棵棵茶树摘光，片片林地拣净”。部分公社还组织了远征队到边远山地采摘野生的零星油茶。
    在摘油茶的同时，各地榨油厂大搞工具改革，提高榨油的效率。
