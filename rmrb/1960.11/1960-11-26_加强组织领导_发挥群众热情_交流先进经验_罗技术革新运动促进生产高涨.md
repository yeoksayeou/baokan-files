Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest Telegram: The Romanian industrial and mining enterprises are enthusiastically carrying out technical innovation movement. This year, the innovation proposals put forward by employees in various places have generally increased compared with last year.

The Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers made a resolution on raising the technical level of production in early July, and also established a technical innovation committee under the Council of Ministers. In order to deepen the technical innovation movement, all industrial and mining enterprises have established specialized leading bodies. "Innovator Work Teams" and "Technical Groups" have been established in workshops. The Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations in the enterprises are also actively carrying out propaganda and mobilization work to promote the technical innovation movement.

The Romanian working people warmly welcome the resolution made by the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers on raising the technical level of production. Workers at the "Red Flag" Automobile Factory and the Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory organized discussions and put forward innovation proposals one after another. Now, one out of every four workers at the Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory is an innovator. The innovation proposals put forward by employees in various enterprises this year have generally increased significantly compared with last year. For example, the "Progress" Factory in Braila and the "Mao Zedong" Factory in Bucharest have both put forward twice as many innovation proposals in the first half of this year as in the same period last year. The "Vasile Roaita" Factory had put forward 210 innovation proposals by October this year, almost twice as many as last year. The petroleum and chemical industry departments adopted more than 2,700 innovation proposals in the first half of this year, an increase of more than 22% compared with the same period last year.

Many innovation proposals have great economic value. After adopting a series of innovation proposals, the Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory improved more than 1,200 kinds of tractor parts, reducing the weight of each tractor body by more than 100 kilograms. The foundry workshop of the "Lathe" Factory in Stalin City can save 30% of molten steel by adopting new casting methods. The more than 2,000 innovation proposals put forward by young people in Bucharest this year have saved the country more than 8 million lei (Romanian currency).

In order to better carry out this movement and continuously improve the technical level of workers, industrial and mining enterprises have generally opened production technology lectures, regularly held operation demonstrations and experience exchange meetings, printed and distributed advanced production technology materials, carried out comradely mutual assistance movements, organized competitions among workers of the same type of work, and some factories have also organized workers to learn from fraternal factories. Through these measures, the production technology level of workers has been further improved. For example, in the "August 23rd" Factory, more than 4,000 workers have mastered advanced working methods. The workers of this factory have increased labor productivity by three times after adopting automatic welding methods. Many workers in the Bucharest No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory have been able to manage three looms at the same time. Now, the scrap rate of many factories has also been reduced. The chassis workshop of the "Red Flag" Factory has reduced the scrap rate of the 533 work section from 2.7% at the beginning of this year to the current 0.5%.

While carrying out the technical innovation movement, factories and enterprises have vigorously promoted modern machinery and equipment at home and abroad, so as to mechanize and automate the production process. Now, the number of coal mining machines used in the Lupeni Coal Mine has increased more than three times compared with the same period last year, and the amount of turbine drilling of the Craiova State Petroleum Drilling Company this year has increased more than five times compared with last year. In order to create conditions for the widespread adoption of automation in various economic sectors, Romania is currently establishing an "Automation" enterprise for researching and designing automated equipment. According to the provisions of the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1960-1965), by 1965, a series of heavy labor processes will be mechanized, and most of the production in the steel, chemical, electric power, and petroleum processing industries will be automated.

    加强组织领导　发挥群众热情　交流先进经验
    罗技术革新运动促进生产高涨
    新华社布加勒斯特电　罗马尼亚工矿企业热烈开展技术革新运动，今年各地职工提出的革新建议比去年普遍增加。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央和部长会议在7月初作出了关于提高生产技术水平的决议，同时还在部长会议下设立了技术革新委员会。各工矿企业为了深入开展技术革新运动，都建立了专门的领导机构。在车间内成立了“革新者工作队”、“技术小组”等组织。企业中的党、团、工会组织也为开展技术革新运动积极进行宣传鼓动工作。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民热烈欢迎罗马尼亚工人党中央和部长会议所作出的关于提高生产技术水平的决议。“红旗”汽车制造厂和恩斯特·台尔曼拖拉机工厂等工人都组织了讨论，并纷纷提出革新建议。现在，恩斯特·台尔曼拖拉机工厂每四个工人就有一名革新者。今年各企业职工提出的革新建议一般都比去年有显著增加，例如布拉伊拉的“进步”工厂、布加勒斯特的“毛泽东”工厂今年上半年提出的革新建议都比去年同期多一倍，“瓦西里·罗埃塔”工厂今年到10月份已提出二百一十条革新建议，比去年将近多两倍。石油和化学工业部门在今年上半年共采用了二千七百多条革新建议，比去年同期多采用22％以上。
    许多革新建议都有很大经济价值。恩斯特·台尔曼拖拉机工厂在采用一系列革新建议以后，改进了拖拉机的一千二百多种零件，使每台拖拉机机体的重量减轻了一百多公斤。斯大林城“车床”工厂的翻砂车间，由于采用新的铸件方法，可以节约30％的钢水。布加勒斯特青年今年以来提出的两千多条革新建议，为国家节约了八百多万列伊（罗币名）。
    为了更好地开展这个运动，不断提高工人的技术水平，各工矿企业普遍开设了生产技术讲座，经常举行操作表演和经验交流会议，印发先进生产技术资料，开展同志式的互助运动，组织同工种工人之间的竞赛，有些工厂还组织工人到兄弟厂去学习。通过这些措施，工人的生产技术水平有了进一步提高。例如，在“8月23日”工厂中，已有四千多名工人掌握了先进的工作方法。这个工厂的工人在采用了自动焊接法以后，使劳动生产率提高了三倍。布加勒斯特第二棉纺厂许多工人已经能够同时管理三台织布机。现在，许多工厂的废品率也降低了，“红旗”工厂的底盘车间五三三工段把废品率从今年年初的百分之二点七降到了目前的百分之零点五。
    在开展技术革新运动的同时，各工厂企业大力推广了国内外现代化机器设备，使生产过程机械化、自动化。现在，卢本尼煤矿所使用的挖煤机比去年同期增加了三倍多，克拉约发州石油钻井公司今年的涡轮钻井量比去年增加了五倍多。为在各经济部门广泛采用自动化创造条件，罗马尼亚目前正在建立一个研究和设计自动化设备的“自动化”企业。根据六年计划（1960—1965年）的规定，到1965年，一系列繁重劳动的工序都将机械化，钢铁、化学、电力、石油加工等工业部门的大部分生产将实现自动化。
