Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch from Tokyo: Approximately six hundred citizens of Tokyo held a rally last night at the Nakano Public Hall in Tokyo to support the Cuban people's anti-American struggle.

This rally was jointly initiated by local peace groups and labor unions. It is one of a series of regional rallies recently held in several prefectures, including Kanagawa, to express support for the Cuban people's struggle.

The Cuban ambassador to Japan, Mario Garcia-Inchaustegui, attended the rally. In his speech, he pointed out that U.S. imperialism stations troops in foreign countries, including Cuba, thereby undermining world peace and hindering the independence of many countries. When the ambassador expressed his hope that the Japanese people would achieve victory in their struggle to abolish military bases in Japan, the participants responded with thunderous applause.

After presenting flowers to the Cuban ambassador, the meeting unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese government explicitly express its support for the Cuban revolution and approve the trade agreement concluded with Cuba as soon as possible.

Then, citizen representatives handed a letter expressing solidarity with the Cuban people to the Cuban ambassador. The letter stated, "The heroic Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialists has inspired us, the Japanese people, and strengthened our confidence in achieving final victory in the struggle against the same enemy. We, who are fighting for Japan's independence, Asian peace, and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan military alliance, extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Cuban people who are engaged in a fierce struggle against U.S. imperialist interference."

Xinhua News Agency, dispatch from New Delhi: According to the Indian Press Trust, a group of people in Calcutta, India, demonstrated in front of the U.S. Consulate in Calcutta on the 7th, demanding that U.S. imperialism not interfere in Cuba.

    新华社15日讯　东京消息：东京的大约六百名市民昨天晚上在东京的中野公共会堂举行集会，支持古巴人民的反美斗争。
    这个集会是由当地的和平团体和工会联合发起的。它是最近在神奈川等几个县举行的一系列表示支持古巴人民斗争的地区性集会之一。
    古巴驻日本大使马里奥·阿耳苏加赖参加了集会。他在会上发言时指出，美帝国主义在外国包括在古巴驻扎军队，从而破坏世界和平和阻碍许多国家的独立。当这位大使表示希望日本人民在争取撤销在日本的军事基地的斗争中获得胜利时，与会者响起了雷鸣般的欢呼声。
    在向古巴大使献花之后，会议一致通过决议，要求日本政府明确地表示支持古巴革命，尽快地批准同古巴缔结的贸易协定。
    然后，市民代表把一封表示声援古巴人民的信件交给了古巴大使。这封信说，“英勇的古巴人民反对美帝国主义者的斗争鼓舞了我们日本人民，增强了我们在反对同一个敌人的斗争中获得最后胜利的信心。为争取日本的独立、亚洲和平和废除美日军事同盟而斗争的我们，对为反对美帝国主义者的干涉而进行激烈的斗争的古巴人民，表示衷心的祝贺”。
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度加尔各答有一批群众7日在美国驻加尔各答的领事馆前面举行示威，要求美帝国主义不要干涉古巴。
