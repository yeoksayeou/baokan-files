Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou Electric Report: Under the unified leadership of the Ganshan Commune in Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, the North Daishe Production Team has resolutely implemented the Party's various policies for several years, giving full play to the enthusiasm of the production team and commune members. Grain production has increased year after year, and income has continuously increased, making it a model team for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production in the county.

North Daishe Production Team used to be a poor place. Before 1956, the state often reduced or exempted their agricultural taxes and provided them with agricultural loans. However, in recent years, especially since communization, the team has increased production year after year. In 1959, total grain output increased by 46.1% compared with 1957, and this year is another good year. Due to the year-by-year increase in grain output, in 1958 and 1959, in addition to fulfilling the state procurement tasks and reserving enough rations, seeds, and feed, there were more than 70,000 catties of reserve grain, and the income of commune members also increased year by year. Taking the average income of each commune member household in 1958 as 100, it increased to 120 in 1959 (referring to the part uniformly distributed by the production team, excluding fertilizer payments and other income from household sideline occupations); according to the preliminary distribution plan this year, the cash income of each commune member household will be further increased compared with last year. Now, the team is a picture of prosperity, with more than 80% of the commune members' families having savings deposits. Everyone is beaming with joy and full of energy.

The key to the team's high-speed development of production is that the production team's Party branch has always resolutely implemented the Party's various policies and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the commune members. When the commune was established in 1958, under the unified leadership of the commune, the team studied the various economic relations related to the transformation of advanced cooperatives into people's communes one by one, formulated contracts, and then fulfilled them one by one according to the contract provisions. Over the past few years, the production team has consistently adhered to the "three guarantees and one reward" system for the production teams. The three guarantees targets are set reasonably and implemented without ambiguity. Grain crops are subject to the "three guarantees", and cash crops are also subject to the "three guarantees". The targets leave leeway for the production teams, allowing them to exceed production. Rewards and penalties are redeemed in the summer and autumn harvests every year, and the annual settlement is redeemed at the end of the year. Last year, nine of the ten production teams received rewards for exceeding production. Now, the implementation of the "three guarantees and one reward" system has become a conscious action of the commune members, and therefore the "three guarantees and one reward" system has also become a factor in promoting production development.

In organizing collective production, this production team has consistently implemented labor quotas and conscientiously evaluated work and recorded points for several years. Work point accounts are cleared daily and settled monthly. The team has consistently adhered to semi-monthly announcements by the production teams and monthly announcements by the production team. At the same time, they also pay great attention to adhering to the principle of "to each according to his ability, to each according to his work," and correctly handle the proportion of the supply part and the wage part; in the distribution, they also adhere to the principle of "less deduction and more points" every year, so the remuneration for each working day increases year by year. Taking the remuneration for each working day in 1958 as 100, it increased to more than 112 in 1959, and it has increased again this year. This makes the commune members more concerned about collective production and constantly maintain full labor enthusiasm.

The production team is the basic unit directly engaged in production. In order to give full play to the role of the production team and mobilize the enthusiasm of the production team cadres and commune members, the Party branch of this team, in accordance with the Party's policies, fixed labor, land, cattle, and farm tools for the production team to use. It is also stipulated that: under the premise of ensuring the completion of the contracted production tasks, the production team can plant according to local conditions, formulate technical measures, and arrange various farm work. When it is necessary to organize advanced production teams to support backward production teams, education is always carried out on the one hand, and voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange are achieved on the other hand, paying for labor and fulfilling it in a timely manner. When discussing production, they also fully consult with the production teams. The production team also stipulates that: under the premise of ensuring the completion of the contracted production tasks, the production team can use idle land to plant miscellaneous grains and vegetables, and engage in part of sideline production. The canteens and welfare undertakings run by the production team are managed by the production team. In this way, hierarchical management is achieved, powers and responsibilities are clarified, and the initiative and enthusiasm of the production team cadres are fully utilized. For example, the Dongcun production team has taken the initiative to continuously grasp the area, grasp the season, and grasp the quality in the past two years, and launched a campaign to exceed the planned production. All farm work has been done in advance. In 1959, grain production exceeded 13,939 catties, and this year both grain production and cash crop production have exceeded the contracted production targets.

Consulting with the masses in everything and relying on the masses in everything is a basic experience for the North Daishe Production Team to correctly implement the Party's policies and do a good job in production according to local conditions. Over the past few years, all Party branch secretaries and members have been assigned to different areas, going deep into the production teams, staying in the teams for a long time, and eating, living, and working with the commune members. Whenever a certain policy is implemented or a certain task is assigned, they first consult with the backbone to unify their thinking and understanding, and then consult with the masses, so that their work is more practical and in line with policies.

The Party branch is very concerned about the lives of the masses. The Party branch secretary and other cadres eat and run the canteens together with the commune members. The cadres eat what the commune members eat, setting an example everywhere. The production team and the production teams have also set up kindergartens and busy farming childcare groups, which take good care of the children, allowing women to work with peace of mind. They also adhere to the principle of combining work and rest, giving male commune members two days of vacation and women four days of vacation each month. (Attached picture)

    北代舍生产队加强领导保证小队部分所有权
    生产小队发挥强大战斗力
    公社化以来粮食年年增产，社员收入普遍提高，全队一片兴旺景象
    据新华社杭州电　浙江德清县澉山公社北代舍生产队在公社的统一领导下，几年来坚决执行党的各项政策，充分发挥生产小队和社员的积极性，粮食年年增产，收入不断增加，成为全县大办农业、大办粮食的标兵队。
    北代舍生产队过去是一个贫困的地方，1956年以前，国家还经常减免他们的农业税，发给他们农业贷款。但是近几年来，特别是公社化以来，这个队连年增产。1959年粮食总产量比1957年增长46.1％，今年又是一个好年成。由于粮食产量逐年增加，1958年和1959年除了完成国家征购任务，留足口粮、种子、饲料外，还有七万多斤储备粮，社员们的收入也年年增加。以1958年平均每户社员收入为一百，1959年增加到一百二十（系生产队统一分配部分，不包括肥料价款和家庭副业等其他收入）；今年按照预分方案，每户社员的现金收入又将比去年进一步提高。现在，这个队是一片兴旺景象，80％以上社员的家庭都有存款，人人喜气洋洋，个个干劲冲天。
    生产队党支部一直坚决贯彻执行党的各项政策，充分地调动社员的积极性，是这个队的生产获得高速度发展的关键。1958年办公社时，在公社统一领导下，这个队就对高级社转为人民公社的有关各项经济关系逐项作了研究，订立合同，以后又都按合同规定逐项兑现。几年来，生产队对小队一直坚持三包一奖制度，三包指标订得合理，执行毫不含糊，粮食作物搞三包，经济作物也搞三包，指标给小队留有余地，让小队有产可超。每年都是夏、秋两季奖罚兑现，年终结算全年兑现。去年，十个小队中有九个小队得到了超产奖励。现在，执行三包一奖制度已成了社员们的自觉行动，因而三包一奖制度也成了推动生产发展的一个因素。
    这个生产队在组织集体生产中，几年来始终实行劳动定额，认真评工记分。工分账目日清月结，一贯坚持小队半月一公布，生产队一月一公布。同时，他们还非常注意坚持各尽所能、按劳分配的原则，正确处理供给部分和工资部分的比例；在分配时，还年年坚持少扣多分的原则，因此每个劳动日的报酬逐年提高，以1958年每个劳动日的报酬为一百，1959年提高到一百一十二以上，今年又有提高。这就使得社员们更加关心集体生产，经常保持饱满的劳动热情。
    生产小队是直接从事生产的基层单位。为了充分发挥小队的作用，调动小队干部和社员的积极性，这个队的党支部按照党的政策，把劳力、土地、耕牛、农具固定给小队使用。并且规定：小队在保证完成包产任务的前提下，可以因地种植，制定技术措施和安排各种农活。在有必要组织先进小队支援后进小队时，总是一方面进行教育，一方面做到自愿互利、等价交换，按劳付酬，及时兑现。在研究生产时，也是充分和各小队商量。生产队还规定：小队在保证完成包产任务的前提下，可以利用闲散土地种植杂粮、蔬菜，经营一部分副业生产。小队办的食堂和福利事业由小队管理。这样，做到了分级管理，职权明确，充分发挥了小队干部的主动性积极性。例如东村小队二年来主动地持续地抓面积、抓季节、抓质量，开展超规划超包产运动，农活样样提前搞好，1959年粮食超产一万三千九百三十九斤，今年粮食产量和经济作物产量又都超过了包产指标。
    遇事和群众商量，事事依靠群众，这是北代舍生产队能够正确贯彻执行党的政策、因地制宜搞好生产的一条基本经验。几年来，党支部书记、委员全部分片包干，深入小队，长期驻队和社员同吃同住同劳动，凡是贯彻执行某一项政策，布置某一项任务，都首先在骨干中商量，统一思想认识，然后再和群众一道商量，这样就使自己的工作比较地切合实际，符合政策。
    党支部对群众生活很关心。支部书记和其他干部都和社员一起吃食堂、办食堂，社员吃啥干部吃啥，处处以身作则。生产队、小队还办起了幼儿班、农忙托儿组，把儿童管养得很好，使妇女安心劳动。他们还坚持劳逸结合原则，每月给男社员休假二天、妇女四天。（附图片）
