Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 6th. Prince Sihanouk, in a recent issue of the "Nationalist" weekly, published an article on his meeting with Eisenhower in New York not long ago, saying that he talked with Eisenhower about the issue of U.S. military aid to Cambodia. Sihanouk wrote: "He (Eisenhower) directly raised the issue of U.S. aid to our army, expressed his reservations, and clearly stated that the possibilities for the United States were limited."

Sihanouk told Eisenhower that his demands were not ambitious and were only aimed at minimally modernizing the Cambodian army; this demand did not mean competing with some of his neighbors—allies of the United States. Sihanouk said that Eisenhower replied that he would consider Cambodia's needs with a very understanding spirit. However, Sihanouk said, this remained a very empty promise.

Sihanouk wrote: Of course, I cannot boast of being liked by the Americans, but on this day I deeply felt like the son of the American president. The American president looked at me a little like a "father," but as a father who didn't know what to do about a "prodigal son's" "incomprehensible" policies.

Sihanouk pointed out that he was not treated in the United States in the same way as other heads of state. He said that his delegation was interfered with several times by the American police to make way for other "big shots." Sihanouk also expressed dissatisfaction with British Prime Minister Macmillan's invitation for him to visit Britain on November 15. He said that Macmillan invited him to visit Britain, but said that the visit was not official, which made him feel unpleasant. He said that he did not accept the invitation. He said, "It must be admitted that my relationship with Britain is not smooth." He also said that Britain "makes me offers every year that are vague in nature and restricted in date, and imposes restrictions in order not to hinder the heavy schedules of Her Majesty the Queen and her Prime Minister, which forces me to politely decline."

    西哈努克谈访美印象
    对美国当局的无礼接待表示不满
    新华社金边6日电　西哈努克亲王在最近一期“民族主义者”周刊上就不久前在纽约同艾森豪威尔的会见发表文章说，他同艾森豪威尔在纽约会谈时谈到了美国对柬埔寨的军事援助问题。西哈努克写道：“他（艾森豪威尔）直接提出美国对我国军队的援助问题，表示他的保留态度，并明确地说美国的可能性是有限的。”
    西哈努克告诉艾森豪威尔，他的要求不是野心勃勃的，其目的只在于使柬埔寨的军队起码地现代化；这个要求并不意味着要同自己的一些邻国——美国的盟国——竞争。西哈努克说：艾森豪威尔回答他说，他将以十分谅解的精神来考虑柬埔寨的需要。但是，西哈努克说，这仍然是十分空洞的许诺。
    西哈努克写道：当然，我不能吹嘘说得到美国人的喜欢，但是在这一天我深深感觉到像是当美国总统的儿子，美国总统有一点像“父亲”那样看待我，不过是作为这样的一个父亲，他对一个“浪”子的“不可理解”的政策感到不知怎样办才好。
    西哈努克指出，他在美国没有受到像对待其他国家元首那样的对待。他说，他的代表团几次受到美国警察干扰，以便给其他“大人物”让路。西哈努克还对英国首相麦克米伦邀请他11月15日访问英国的态度表示不满。他说，麦克米伦邀请他去英国访问，但说这次访问不是正式的，因而使他感到不愉快。他说，他没有接受这个邀请。他说，“应该承认，我同英国的关系是不顺利的。”他还说，英国“每年向我提出的邀请，性质不明确，日期又加以限制，而且为了不妨碍女王陛下和她的首相的繁重日程而施加限制，使我不得不婉言谢绝。”
