Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. According to Soviet press reports, Soviet education has been vigorously developing since the October Revolution. The national network of general education schools has greatly expanded. The number of seven- and eight-year schools in cities is almost four times greater than before the October Revolution, and in rural areas, it has increased 120 times. This year, the number of students in Soviet higher, secondary technical and vocational schools reached more than four million, equivalent to 22.4 times the number of students in similar schools in Tsarist Russia before the October Revolution. In the past few decades, Soviet education has advanced on an unprecedented scale. Currently, almost every family has someone studying. Every year, tens of thousands of young people graduate from higher, secondary technical, and specialized schools and participate in the work of various sectors of the national economy. In terms of general education, ten-year education has been implemented in the capitals of all republics and major cities, and more than half of the ten-year schools nationwide are located in rural areas. In any region of the Soviet Union, even very remote rural areas, there are general schools to ensure that all school-age children have ample opportunities to study at school. In the 1958-1959 academic year, the number of students in Soviet general schools reached more than 30 million, equivalent to four times the number of students in general schools in the 1914-1915 academic year before the October Revolution. The number of teachers has increased from 280,000 before the revolution to more than two million. Currently, the Soviet Union has an average of one teacher for every seventeen students, while the United States has an average of one teacher for every eighty-two students.
    The development of Soviet higher education institutions and secondary technical and specialized schools is also very rapid. Before 1917, higher education institutions were only located in twenty-one cities in the European part of Russia. Now, almost all of the 270 cities in the Soviet Union with a population of more than 50,000 have higher education institutions, and each republic has its own universities and specialized schools. During the Tsarist period, there were no higher education institutions at all in the Kazakh and Central Asian regions (Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan). However, in the 1959-1960 academic year, the Kazakh and Central Asian republics had more than eighty higher education institutions with a total of 211,000 students; there were 176,000 students in secondary technical and specialized schools. These republics have an average of eighty-eight university students and seventy-three secondary technical and specialized school students per 10,000 residents (not including young students studying outside the republic, such as in Moscow, Leningrad, and other Soviet cultural centers), while France currently has only forty university students per 10,000 residents, Italy has only thirty-four, and West Germany has only thirty-one.
    Currently, Soviet education is at a new stage of development. The connection between school education and practical life is being further strengthened, and spare-time and correspondence education are being greatly developed.
    In the 1959-1960 academic year, 750 higher education institutions and hundreds of secondary schools across the Soviet Union were working according to new education programs. The purpose of the new education program is to overcome the phenomenon of the separation of education from life, strengthen labor education, cultivate students to participate in practical life and beneficial labor, and cultivate new people with rich knowledge, noble moral qualities, and sound physiques. Due to the strengthening of the connection between schools and life, students' understanding of labor has improved, and their attitude towards learning has become more serious. Many university students have become members of "Communist Labor Teams" in their work, and many secondary school students have volunteered to work in rural areas and factories after graduation.

    十月革命结出丰硕的文化果实
    苏联教育事业蓬勃发展
    高等和中等技术与专科学校学生总数为革命前22倍
    据新华社莫斯科3日电　据苏联报刊报道：十月革命以来的苏联教育事业正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。现在，全国普通学校教育网已经大为扩大，城市的七、八年制学校数目比十月革命前差不多增加四倍，而在农村则增加了一百二十倍。今年苏联高等和中等技术和专科学校的学生达到了四百多万人，等于十月革命前沙皇俄国同类学校的学生人数的二十二点四倍。在过去几十年中，苏联教育事业以前所未有的规模向前推进。目前，几乎每一个家庭都有人在学习。每年有成千上万的青年从高等和中等技术和专门学校毕业，参加国民经济各部门的工作。在普通教育方面，现在各加盟共和国的首都和各大城市都实行了十年制教育，全国有半数以上的十年制学校设在农村。在苏联的任何一个地区，即使是非常边远的农村地区，都设有普通学校，以便保证全体学龄儿童享有在学校读书的充分机会。1958—1959学年，苏联普通学校的学生人数达三千多万，等于十月革命前1914—1915学年普通学校学生人数的四倍；教师人数由革命前的二十八万发展到二百多万。目前，苏联平均每十七个学生就有一个教师，而在美国，平均八十二个学生才有一个教师。
    苏联高等学校和中等技术和专门学校的发展也很快。1917年前，高等学校仅设在俄罗斯欧洲部分的二十一个城市。而现在，苏联全国五万人口以上的二百七十个城市中几乎都设有高等学校，每个加盟共和国都有自己的大学和专科学校。在沙皇统治时期，哈萨克和中亚细亚地区（乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯、塔吉克、土库曼）根本没有高等学校。但在1959—1960学年，哈萨克和中亚细亚各共和国已设有八十多所高等学校，在校学生共二十一万一千人；中等技术和专门学校学生共十七万六千人。这些共和国平均每一万居民中有八十八个大学生和七十三个中等技术和专门学校的学生（其中还不包括在本共和国以外的地方，如莫斯科、列宁格勒和苏联其他文化中心学习的青年学生），而法国目前每一万居民中只有四十名大学生，意大利只有三十四名，西德只有三十一名。
    现在，苏联教育事业正处在新的发展阶段，学校教育同实际生活的联系正在进一步加强，业余和函授教育正在大大发展。
    在1959—1960学年，苏联全国已有七百五十所高等学校和几百所中学按照新的教育方案工作。新教育方案的目的在于克服教育与生活脱节的现象，加强劳动教育，培养学生参加实际生活和有益的劳动，培养具有丰富的知识、高尚的道德品质和健全体魄的新人。由于加强了学校同生活的联系，学生对劳动的认识提高了，因而对待学习的态度也更加认真了。许多大学生在劳动中成了“共产主义劳动队”的成员，许多中学生在毕业以后都自愿到农村和工厂去工作。
