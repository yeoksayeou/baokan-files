    Canada's production is declining and unemployment is increasing.
    (Reported) The Canadian economy is facing a bleak situation. On the evening of October 31, the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" published a dispatch from its special correspondent Daizhong from New York under the title "Production Decline, Unemployment Increase," stating that "Canada's recession is becoming serious one step ahead of the United States." The message said that this recession started in the second quarter of this year.
    Daizhong said: According to the recent announcement by the Canadian Bureau of Statistics, the gross national product in the second quarter, after adjusting for seasonal variations, decreased by 1.5% compared with the first quarter. This decline in gross national product is the first since the 1957 recession.
    The unemployment problem is an acute sign of the deterioration of the Canadian economy. According to this Japanese reporter, even Prime Minister Diefenbaker himself admits that the biggest problem facing the government is unemployment. According to statistics as of September 17, the number of unemployed is 227,000, which is equivalent to 5.1% of the labor force, an increase of 1.5% compared with the same period last year. With the arrival of winter, the number of unemployed will increase.
    This Japanese reporter also cited some figures in the Canadian economy: construction work decreased by 32% compared with last year; the number of company bankruptcies increased by 31%; company profits decreased by 9%; equipment investment decreased by 7%; and then quoted experts as saying: the recession is still continuing, and it is said that the recession has accelerated in some areas.

    加拿大生产下降失业增加
    本报讯　加拿大经济正面临着阴暗的局面。日本“读卖新闻”10月31日晚刊以“生产下降，失业增加”为题登载了该报特派记者大钟自纽约发回的一则消息说，“加拿大的衰退比美国提前一步变得严重起来”。消息说，这次衰退是从今年第二季度开始的。
    大钟说：据加拿大统计局最近公布，第二季度的国家生产总值是根据季节性变动调整以后的数字，比第一季度下降了1.5％。这次国家生产总值的下降，从1957年衰退以来还是第一次出现。
    失业问题，是加拿大经济恶化的一个尖锐标志。据这个日本记者报道，连迪芬贝克总理自己也承认政府当前所面临的最大问题是失业。根据截至9月17日为止的统计数字来看，失业人数是二十二万七千人，这相当于劳动人口的5.1％，较去年同期增加了1.5％。随着冬季的到来，失业人数还会增加。
    这个日本记者还举出了加拿大经济中的一些数字：建筑工作较去年减少了32％；公司破产数却增加了31％；公司的利润减少了9％；设备投资减少了7％；然后引述专家的话说：衰退目前仍在继续，据说在一部分地区还加快了衰退的速度。
