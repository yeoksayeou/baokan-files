The Rich and Colorful Multinational Art of the Soviet Union
Zhao Feng

On the eve of the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the people of the capital have the opportunity to appreciate the wonderful performances of the Soviet Artists Performance Troupe, adding a bright flower to this garden of chrysanthemums in full bloom.

The program of the Soviet Artists Performance Troupe is multifaceted and rich, including ballet and folk dances, classical music and folk songs, acrobatics and puppetry, magic and skills. These rich and varied programs reflect the vigorous development of the art of various nationalities in the Soviet Union. The artists come from Lithuania and Latvia on the Baltic coast, from Kiev in Ukraine, from Tbilisi in the Caucasus, from Novosibirsk and Buryat-Mongolia. This adds a layer of brilliant ethnic color to the performance, which already encompasses various aspects in terms of program content.

I cannot introduce all the dances and skills programs one by one. I can only say that these folk dances and skills have been processed on stage to be more concentrated and more beautiful. I would like to especially introduce the Russian folk dance, which expresses a strong, heroic, and optimistic spirit, as well as the fragment of the ballet "Beauty Angara" composed by Knipfel, performed by the Buryat-Mongolian female dancer Shakhjanova and her partner Abasheev. Just as the music of this ballet is endowed with a strong folk style, the dancers have added some elements of folk dance movements to the strict program of classical ballet, adding another kind of moving charm.

Although the solo singer Stasiunenas did not sing Russian opera arias in the first day's performance, his voice fully possesses the characteristics of the Russian singing school: deep and magnificent. The female solo singer Kalistratova sang Rachmaninoff's lyrical song "Spring Waters" and Dunayevsky's "Toast Song." She freely used her skillful technique to express music with different styles. She is an excellent solo singer of the All-Union Radio, and therefore she often adapts to the needs of radio singing by strengthening her interpretation of music, making her singing have a strong appeal. Her singing of "Spring Waters," delicately expressing the content of this exemplary Russian lyric, left a deep impression on us.

Violinist Grokhov's performance has unique characteristics, namely, delicacy and lightness. From this, we can also see the different development of different stylistic features of the colorful Soviet violin playing school. In addition to the leading school with broad, deep, passionate, and heroic characteristics, the school known for its delicacy is also developing. Yakovlev's dombra solo showed his proficient playing skills, characterized by gorgeousness and lightness. His performance of Budashkin's dombra concerto enriched the expressive ability of this instrument, which originally had certain limitations in expression, adding some plucking methods and fingerings, and achieving good results in the performance of arpeggios.

Congratulations on the success of the Soviet artists' performances. Their performance activities will add color to our festive celebrations and will make a beneficial contribution to the friendship between the great peoples of our two countries. (Attached picture)

    丰富多采的多民族的苏联艺术
    赵沨
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年的前夕，首都人民有机会欣赏到苏联艺术家表演团的精彩演出，在这秋菊怒放的百花园里，增加了一支鲜艳的花朵。
    苏联艺术家表演团的节目是多方面的和丰富多采的，有芭蕾舞和民间舞，有古典音乐和民歌说唱，有杂技和木偶，有魔术和技艺。这些丰富多采的节目又体现了苏联各民族的艺术得到了蓬勃的发展。艺术家们来自波罗的海沿岸的立陶宛和拉脱维亚，来自乌克兰的基辅，来自高加索的梯比利斯，来自新西伯利亚和布里亚特蒙古。这就使这个本来在节目内容上包罗各方面的表演增加一层灿烂的民族的色彩。
    我不可能对所有的舞蹈和技艺节目一一加以介绍。我只能说，这些来自民间的舞蹈和技艺经过了舞台处理是更加集中和显得更加优美了。我愿意特别介绍的是俄罗斯民间舞的表现那种强烈、豪迈和乐观的气概，以及来自布里亚特蒙古的女舞蹈家莎赫雅诺娃和她的对手阿巴舍也夫表演的、克尼伯尔作曲的舞剧《美女安加拉》的片断，正像这个舞剧音乐赋有强烈的民间风格一样，舞蹈家在古典舞剧的严格程式的基础上，增加了一些民间舞蹈的动作的因素，增加了另一种动人的魅力。
    独唱家斯塔修纳斯在第一天的表演中，虽然还没有演唱俄罗斯歌剧的咏叹调，但他的声音完全具有俄罗斯演唱学派的特点：深厚而壮阔，女独唱家卡丽斯特拉托娃演唱了拉赫玛尼诺夫的抒情曲《春潮》和杜那也夫斯基的《祝酒歌》，她自如地以其纯熟的技巧表现了具有不同风格的音乐。她是优秀的全苏广播电台的独唱家，因而她常以其对音乐解释上的加强来适应广播演唱的需要，使她的演唱具有一种强烈的感染力。她演唱的《春潮》，细致地表现了这个典范的俄罗斯抒情曲的内容，给我们留下了深刻的印象。
    小提琴家格罗霍夫的演出有着独具的特点，那就是纤细和轻巧，从这里，我们也可以看到多采的苏联提琴演奏学派的不同风格特征的不同发展，在主导的具有宽广、深厚、热情、豪迈的特征的学派之外，以纤巧见长的学派也正得到发展。雅科弗列夫的东不拉独奏显示了他的熟练的演奏技巧，特点是华丽而轻快。他演奏的布达斯金的东不拉协奏曲，使这种本来在表现上有一定局限的乐器，丰富了它的表现能力，增加了一些弹拨方法和指法，在诸如琶音的演奏上取得了很好的效果。
    祝贺苏联艺术家演出的成功，他们的演出活动，将为我们欢度节日增加一番色彩，将为我们两国伟大人民之间的友谊作出有益的贡献。（附图片）
