    Xiamen Workers Support the Agricultural Frontline
    More than 20,000 cadres and workers from the industrial, transportation, finance, and trade systems of Xiamen City, Fujian Province, and its subordinate Tong'an County and commune industries have been dispatched to the agricultural frontline. Some are engaged in long-term rural construction, while others provide short-term support. This newly arrived labor force in the countryside is in high spirits and full of energy. Zhu Yingji, a young female worker from the Maxiang Weaving Factory, arrived in the countryside and, on the second morning, without waiting for the production team leader to assign work, rolled up her trousers and followed the commune members to Tangcuo Port, five or six *li* away, to collect sea mud fertilizer.
    The movement to support agricultural production has further enhanced the relationship between urban and rural people and greatly encouraged the broad masses of commune members.
