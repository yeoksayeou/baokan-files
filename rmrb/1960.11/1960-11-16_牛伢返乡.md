    Niu Ya Returns Home
    Wang Boxi
	Stepping out, returning to the village, Niu Ya's heart couldn't stop leaping. The scene of leaving is still fresh in his memory... Braving the rain, weathering the wind, he bid farewell to his hometown, his loved ones, leaning on a bamboo stick, wearing patched clothes, harboring a bellyful of hatred. He left, the Niu Ya you know, wandering to the ends of the earth, lonely and helpless in all directions! Farewell, mountain village where I was born and raised. Farewell, the blue stone I sat on while herding cattle, the mountain ridge I climbed while chopping firewood, the pond I swam in while harvesting rice, the field ridges I rested on while planting rice. Farewell, uncles, sisters-in-law, brothers, maybe you will never see Niu Ya again, maybe, ah... Eyes full of hot tears, a stomach full of bitterness.
	Decades of battle—swift passing time. Niu Ya found his way, following the Communist Party! Through water and fire, he cleaved open roads, and cut down all the thorns. The Chinese people stood up, and Niu Ya entered the factory gate! Wearing the sun, facing the wind, how warm this bright sun is, how kind this gentle breeze is!
	Today, supporting agriculture, Niu Ya has returned to his hometown. Hometown, how familiar we are, and how strange we are. Go for a walk on Chopwood Ridge, the ripe apples are all red; sit on Herding Stone, the pasture is green and the cattle and sheep are in flocks; songs rise from the nursery, drums and flutes sound in the home for the elderly, the commune canteen holds a celebration, celebrating our reunion after a long separation!
	He left as a bachelor, and returned with a big family. He left called Niu Ya, and returns called Master. Screwdriver and pliers are tied around his waist, working day and night to build a new mountain village. Mountain village, loved ones, Master Niu loves you so deeply, Master Niu has inexhaustible strength for you.
	In the past, for you, he dedicated half his life to fighting in the north and south; today, for you, Master Niu has dedicated everything he has to your bright future!

    牛伢返乡
    王伯熙迈开步，返回村，止不住跳动的心。那去时的情景，至今记忆新……顶着雨，披着风，别了家乡，亲人，拄一根竹棍，穿一身补丁，积一腹仇恨。去了呀，你们熟悉的牛呀，到天涯流浪去了，东南西北，孤苦伶仃！别了，生我长我的山村。别了，放牛时坐过的青石，砍柴时爬过的山岭，打禾时游过的池塘，插田时歇过的田垅。别了，大伯、姑嫂、弟兄，也许你们再看不见牛伢了，也许，呵……满眶热泪，一肚酸辛。几十年的战斗，——飞快的光阴。牛伢找到了路，跟着共产党！水里出，火里进，劈开了道路，斩尽了棘荆。中国人民翻了身，牛伢进了工厂门！戴着日，迎着风，这艳阳多么暖，这和风多么亲！今日支援农业，牛伢回到了家乡。家乡呀，我们多么熟悉，我们又多么陌生。砍柴岭上去走一走，熟透的苹果一片红；放牛石上去坐一坐，牧草青青牛羊成群；托儿所里歌声起，敬老院里箫鼓鸣，公社食堂开欢庆会，欢庆我们久别又重逢！去时是条光棍汉，回来有了个大家庭。去时叫牛伢，回时把师傅称。螺刀、钳子扎腰中，日夜不停建设新山村。山村呀亲人，牛师傅爱你爱得多么深，牛师傅为你有使不完的劲。过去呵为了你，南征北战献半生；今天为了你，牛师傅又把他的一切，献给了你的锦绣前程！
