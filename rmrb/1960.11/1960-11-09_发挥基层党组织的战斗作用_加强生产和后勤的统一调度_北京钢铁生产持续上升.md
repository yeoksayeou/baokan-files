Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: Capital steelworkers, who have overfulfilled the state plan every month this year, are displaying even greater enthusiasm for production in the fourth quarter. The city's output of steel, pig iron, and steel products continued to rise steadily in October after a substantial increase in September. The quality of these three products all reached and exceeded planned requirements, and material consumption was also lower than in September.

To complete this year's production plan comprehensively and ahead of schedule, all steel enterprises in the city launched an even more intense socialist competition in October, with furnaces competing against furnaces, and shifts competing against shifts. Daily inspections and shift-by-shift evaluations were conducted, and production records were constantly being refreshed. In Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, the city's largest steel enterprise, workers at each large blast furnace and each converter are competing with each other, and the output of steel, pig iron, and various steel products in October increased by 14%, 2.3%, and 16% respectively compared with September. The qualification rate of steel and pig iron both reached over 99%. Local steel factories are also catching up rapidly. The pig iron production of Xuanwu Iron Plant increased by 14% in October compared with September. Workers at Jianguo Steel Rolling Plant made every effort to maintain equipment and improve operating rates, and steel production in October increased by 10% compared with September.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the steel enterprises have established production and logistics command headquarters to strengthen the scheduling and command of production, material supply, and transportation. Various steel enterprises and departments related to steel production have also promoted the spirit of communist collaboration, exchanged information in a timely manner, supported each other, and promoted each other to ensure high output every day, shift, and furnace.

Since entering the fourth quarter, political and ideological work in various steel enterprises has been carried out more thoroughly and meticulously. On the basis of leading cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management, and focusing on grassroots work, many units have further strengthened the work of Party branches and Party groups, giving full play to the fighting role of Party grassroots organizations and bringing political and ideological work to the furnaces, dormitories, and canteens, and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company has generally adjusted the Party groups so that the Party groups are aligned with the production teams. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the party members of each Party group influence the masses with their exemplary actions at all times and places. Under the leadership of the Party organization, the workers of each shift in the converter steelmaking workshop of this company discussed the comprehensive leap forward experience of the Ma Xiaoliu steelmaking group, an advanced group with high output and low consumption in the workshop, and launched a heat wave to study and catch up with this group. The Zhang Chengkui group gave full play to the role of each worker administrator, calculated and analyzed each furnace, and adopted advanced operating experience such as small slag volume, early slag formation, and stable shaking of the furnace, which greatly increased the daily output of steel. The steel production in October increased by 30% compared with September, the qualification rate of steel reached over 99%, and the iron consumption per ton of steel decreased by 20% compared with September, becoming the champion of high yield, high quality, and low consumption in the entire workshop.

The continuous rise in steel production levels has placed higher demands on material supply, transportation, and other related departments. In order to adapt to this situation, under the unified leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, all relevant parties have adopted practical and effective measures for the supply of pig iron, the production of coke, refractory materials, and electrodes, and the arrangement of transportation, and have carried out mass movements to ensure high steel production. The city-wide movement to recycle waste steel and iron has been further deepened. A large amount of scrap steel and iron is being transported to various steel plants. The city's transportation department has implemented unified planning, unified dispatch, and adopted measures such as pairing up with relevant factories and mines, sending people to reside in factories, and fixing vehicle groups to ensure that the materials required for steel production are transported as they are produced.

Many units have also further strengthened equipment maintenance and repair and spare parts manufacturing, established and improved equipment maintenance and repair systems, and carried out a movement to eliminate equipment defects among maintenance and production workers, achieving less equipment damage, longer service life, and higher efficiency. This is one of the important reasons for the continuous rise in production levels.

    发挥基层党组织的战斗作用　加强生产和后勤的统一调度
    北京钢铁生产持续上升
    据新华社8日讯今年月月超额完成国家计划的首都钢铁工人，在第四季度生产热情更加高涨，全市钢、生铁和钢材的产量继9月份大幅度增长以后，10月份又稳定上升。这三种产品的质量都分别达到和超过了计划要求，材料消耗也比9月低。
    为了提早全面完成今年生产计划，一进10月，全市各钢铁企业展开了更加炽烈的社会主义竞赛，炉与炉比，班与班赛，天天检查，班班评比，生产纪录不断刷新。全市最大的钢铁企业——石景山钢铁公司的各个大型高炉和每座转炉的职工互相追赶，10月份的钢、生铁和各钢材产量分别比9月提高了14％、2.3％和16％。钢和生铁的合格率都达到99％以上。地方各钢铁厂也猛追猛赶。宣武铁厂的生铁产量10月份比9月提高了14％。建国轧钢厂轧制钢材的工人，千方百计维护设备，提高作业率，10月份钢材产量比9月提高10％。
    中共北京市委和各钢铁企业都成立了生产和后勤指挥部，加强了生产和材料供应、运输等各方面的调度和指挥，各钢铁企业间以及和钢铁生产有关的各个部门，也发扬共产主义大协作的精神，及时互通情报，互相支援，互相促进，以保证天天、班班、炉炉高产。
    进入第四季度以后，各个钢铁企业的政治思想工作做得更加深入细致，很多单位在领导干部参加劳动、工人参加管理和大抓班组工作的基础上，进一步加强了党支部和党小组的工作，充分发挥党的基层组织的战斗作用，把政治思想工作做到炉前、宿舍和食堂，充分调动广大职工的积极性。石景山钢铁公司普遍对党小组进行了调整，使党小组和生产小组对口。在党支部的领导下，各个党小组的党员，随时随地以自己的模范行动影响群众。这个公司转炉炼钢车间各班工人，在党组织的领导下，讨论了本车间高产低耗的先进小组——马小六炼钢小组全面跃进的经验，掀起了学习、追赶这个小组的热潮。张成奎小组充分发挥每个工人管理员的作用，炉炉核算分析，采取小渣量、早化渣和稳摇炉等先进操作经验，使钢的日产量大幅度上升，10月份的钢产量比9月提高30％，钢的合格率达到99％以上，每吨钢的铁耗比9月下降了20％，成为全车间高产优质低耗的冠军。
    钢铁生产水平不断上升，给材料供应、运输等有关部门提出了更高的要求。为适应这种情况，在中共北京市委的统一领导下，各有关方面对生铁供应，焦炭、耐火材料、电极的生产，以及交通运输的安排等采取了切实有力的措施，开展了确保钢铁高产的群众运动。全市性的回收废钢废铁的运动进一步深入。现在大批的废钢铁正在向各钢厂运送。全市交通运输部门实行统一计划、统一调度，并采取同有关厂矿对口挂钩、派人驻厂、固定车组等措施，保证钢铁生产所需要的物资随产随运。
    很多单位还进一步加强设备维护检修和备品备件制造，建立健全设备维护检修制度，并在维修和生产工人中开展消灭设备缺陷的运动，做到了设备损坏少、寿命长、效率高。这是生产水平不断上升的重要原因之一。
