Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, November 6th. Tunisian Minister of Agriculture Abdelsalam Knani, Minister of Industry and Transportation E. Abassi, and Minister of Public Health and Social Affairs Ahmed Ben Salah recently received Yu Liguang, head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation participating in the Tunis International Fair, and Deputy Head Yue Daiheng. The hosts and guests engaged in friendly conversations.

Minister of Agriculture Knani, in his discussion with the head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation, said that the relationship between Tunisia and China had developed smoothly. He said that imperialism claimed that China had an iron curtain. In fact, China does not have an iron curtain.

Knani pointed out that the friendship between China and Tunisia is built on a natural foundation. He said that neither of these countries has ever invaded another country; on the contrary, both of these countries have been subjected to imperialist aggression for centuries. He said that we have common aspirations, especially the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism, which is a great encouragement to the Tunisian people.

The Minister of Agriculture praised the achievements made by the Chinese people, led by Chairman Mao, in national construction. He said that the Chinese people had brought their own strength into play in construction, overcoming many difficulties and solving many problems.

He said that China is a populous country. China's agricultural development is amazing. He pointed out that China's experience in agricultural development, especially the experience of transforming from an agricultural country into a modern industrial country, is worth learning from and is an example for other countries.

The Minister of Agriculture also praised China's industrial achievements, and China's genuine assistance and support to the Algerian people and the African people who are fighting for independence. He said that the main reason for China's progress is that the Chinese people have taken control of their own destiny and become masters of the country. He said that the Chinese people are hardworking, brave, and intelligent people. For the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. He expressed his belief that China's construction will achieve even greater success.

Minister of Public Health and Social Affairs Salah said that the Tunisian people were deeply moved by the Chinese people's assistance and support to the Algerian people. He said that the Algerian people's struggle is also the Tunisian people's struggle. China's support for Algeria brings Tunisia and China closer.

He said that China is an ancient country, but its development is rapid. The minister praised this. He added that Tunisia is overcoming difficulties in building the country.

Minister of Industry and Transportation E. Abassi told the head of the Chinese Exhibition Delegation that Tunisia has been striving to develop its industry since independence. He said that now, in Tunisia, it is even more important to develop small and medium-sized enterprises. He expressed his belief that the relationship between Tunisia and China would be further developed.

    农业部长肯纳尼在同中国展览团负责人交谈时说，突尼斯和中国的关系有了顺利的发展。他说，帝国主义说什么中国有铁幕。事实上，中国是没有铁幕的。
    肯纳尼指出，中国和突尼斯两国的友谊是建立在自然的基础上的。他说，这两个国家从来没有侵犯过别的国家；相反地，这两个国家百年来一直受着帝国主义的侵略。他说，我们有共同的愿望，特别是中国人民反对帝国主义的斗争，对于突尼斯人民来说是莫大的鼓舞。

    这位农业部长还赞扬中国的工业成就、和中国对正在进行争取独立斗争的阿尔及利亚人民和非洲人民的真正援助和支持。他说，中国所以取得进展的主要原因是，中国人民掌握了自己的命运，成了国家的主人。他说，中国人民是勤劳、勇敢、智慧的人民。对中国人民来说，在毛主席领导下，没有不能克服的困难。他表示相信，中国的建设将获得更大的成就。
    公共卫生和社会事务部长萨拉赫说，突尼斯人民为中国人民对阿尔及利亚人民的援助和支持深受感动。他说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争也是突尼斯人民的斗争。中国人民对阿尔及利亚的支持使突尼斯和中国更加接近。
    他说，中国是一个古老的国家，但是发展却是迅速的。这位部长对此加以赞扬。他又说，突尼斯正在克服建设国家中的困难。
    工业和运输部长埃·阿巴西对中国展览团团长说，突尼斯在独立以后就努力发展工业。他说，现在，在突尼斯，更为重要的是发展中小型企业。他表示相信，突尼斯和中国的关系将得到进一步的发展。
