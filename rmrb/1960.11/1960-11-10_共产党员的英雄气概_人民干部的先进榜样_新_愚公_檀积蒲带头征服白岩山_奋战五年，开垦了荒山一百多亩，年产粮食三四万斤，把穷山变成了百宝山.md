The heroic spirit of a Communist Party member, an advanced model for the people's cadres.
The new "Foolish Old Man" Tan Jipu leads the conquest of Baiyan Mountain.
After five years of hard work, he reclaimed more than 100 mu of barren mountains, producing 30,000 to 40,000 jin of grain annually, turning a poor mountain into a treasure mountain.
Among the broad masses in the mountainous areas of Yongtai County, Fujian Province, a heart-stirring story of the "New Foolish Old Man Conquering Baiyan Mountain" is being circulated. This new "Foolish Old Man" is Tan Jipu, a Communist Party member of Heyang Brigade, Dayang Commune. Responding to the call of the Party, he led his wife, children, brothers, and more than ten mountain-cultivating team members, striving for progress, persevering, and working hard on Baiyan Mountain for five years, building the past poor mountains and evil ridges into a new mountainous area with piles of grain, shady fruit trees, flocks of poultry and livestock, and the sound of reading.

	Facing Current Difficulties, the Whole Family Smiles and Moves to the Barren Mountain
	Looking Forward to a Happy Future, Building a Home with Our Own Hands

Born into a poor peasant family, Tan Jipu took on the burden of supporting his whole family at the age of sixteen. When he was eighteen, he was forced to hide in the deep mountains due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' conscription, and spent fifteen long years cultivating the mountains. After liberation, he came out of the deep mountains, and under the leadership of the Party, he participated in land reform, was allocated land, and moved into a newly built tile-roofed house.
In the autumn of 1955, the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative led by Tan Jipu achieved a bumper harvest with a nearly 40% increase in grain production, but the cooperative's grain was still not completely self-sufficient. At this time, Tan Jipu put forward his grand vision: to use his own hands to turn the large area of barren mountains into "granaries." After surveying, he decided to reclaim the nearby Baiyan Mountain. This mountain was steep and high, and wild animals roamed freely. At that time, some commune members were unwilling to go. Due to the small number of people, Tan Jipu also brought his fourteen-year-old eldest son, Tan Zunxiang, as an assistant. Before leaving, the Party branch secretary, Tan Lijin, said to him: "As long as you play the vanguard well and set an example, more people will go up the mountain." Several people carried bedding, pots, mountain hoes, and machetes, braving the winter cold, and climbed the rugged mountain road to Baiyan Mountain.
In the winter of 1957, the prelude to the Great Leap Forward was unveiled, and Tan Jipu was honorably elected as a model agricultural laborer in the county. The Party gave him honor and encouragement. He more clearly recognized the importance of building mountainous areas to increase grain production. Therefore, he made up his mind: simply move the whole family to the mountain to build the mountainous area for a long time.
He returned to his old home to discuss with his younger brother, Tan Ji'ai. Ji'ai had helped with work on the mountain before and had long wanted to cultivate the mountain for a long time, so he agreed immediately. Tan Jipu happily went to discuss it with his wife, Yan Yingying. His wife hesitated for a while and said, "In the past, I followed you to run around the mountains all year round, living in thatched huts and eating wild vegetables. I never complained. Now that we've finally made it, living in new tile-roofed houses, how can I bear to leave after finally having these few years of comfortable life?" Tan Jipu looked at the spacious and comfortable new house, and stroked the three young daughters in front of him, thinking to himself: "Yes! Since she came to the Tan family, she hasn't lived in a good tile-roofed house for a single day, nor has she had a good life. Now, how can I bear to let her go to the mountains to take risks again! No wonder she doesn't want to go!" But then he thought: "If everyone thought this way, how could socialism be built?" So he patiently said: "Yingying, have you ever thought about who forced us to live in thatched huts in the mountains in the past? Who enabled us to turn over and live in new houses now? What is the reason for going to the mountains and living in thatched huts again?" Yingying was a sensible person. Thinking about the past and looking at the present, she excitedly said, "Isn't that obvious? In the past, the reactionary landlords forced us to live in thatched huts in the mountains; without the Communist Party, we would never have been able to turn over and live in new houses in our entire lives. Of course, going to the mountains again now is different from the past. Don't you always say it's for socialism!" After speaking, the couple both smiled. Tan Jipu said, "That's right! Going to the mountains now is to build socialism, and in the future, we will be able to live in new buildings that are even better than this one, so let's move!"
Tan Jipu led his family of ten, packed their luggage and furniture, and took chickens, ducks, and rabbits, bid farewell to their relatives, and left the new building they had only lived in for a few years, happily moving to the mountain. Many people were moved by the family's ambition to develop the mountainous area for a long time, and even those who were unwilling to go to the mountain before said, "If he can go to the mountain with his whole family, what else can I say?" So, many more people asked to go to the mountain.

	Cutting Through Thorns, Building Dams, and Scattering the Sweat of Labor
	Fruit Trees Become Forests, Livestock Become Flocks, Enjoying the Joy of Harvest

After more people went to the mountain, there were, of course, many difficulties at the beginning. Taking life as an example, Tan Jipu's family of ten initially squeezed into two small thatched huts, which leaked when it rained heavily, and the thatch could be blown off by strong winds. The mountain was full of desolation, and wild animals appeared at night, so the children were often worried when they went out. Other commune members also didn't get used to it at first. However, all of this was nothing to Tan Jipu's brothers, who had socialist consciousness and were used to cultivating mountains. They often recalled the bitter days of wearing burlap bags, eating sweet potato residue, and wild vegetables before liberation, and looked forward to the beautiful prospects of mountainous area construction, teaching their children to establish new feelings with the barren mountains, and allowing their children to become stronger in the wind and rain. When the commune members saw their family was so unyielding, they no longer took the difficulties of life to heart.
However, the greater difficulties were still in production. Baiyan Mountain has fifteen bays, and each bay is covered with dense and sharp cogon grass. To open up wasteland, people could get in, hear the conversation but not see the faces; once out, the faces, hands, and legs could be pricked. Once, a dozen team members were cutting grass and opening up wasteland together, and some people couldn't hold on; they retreated down the hillside; Tan Jipu insisted on not retreating, and insisted on continuing with his brother Tan Ji'ai and his seventeen-year-old son Zunxiang. The people who went down the mountain saw their tenacious energy and no longer took the sharp grass to heart, and encouraged each other to cut forward.
In this way, the mountain-cultivating team finally reclaimed a large area of sweet potato fields along the banks of the mountain stream. However, when mountain floods came, the fertile soil in the sweet potato fields was often washed away, and the potato seedlings were often damaged. Therefore, Tan Jipu led everyone to build flood control dikes in the severe cold of the twelfth lunar month. Soaking in the water to lift stones and build stone foundations was a difficult and heavy task, so he jumped into the two-foot-deep water to lead the way. Once, Tan Jipu fell ill, but still supported himself with crutches to the site to inspect the quality of the project and provide technical guidance. The team members were all moved, and each of them worked hard in the cold water against the cold wind, and finally built four flood control dikes that were more than forty-three zhang long, blocking the mountain floods and protecting the fruits of their labor. Tan Jipu had the ambition to conquer Baiyan Mountain in his heart, and he had inexhaustible strength. People said: One can only work three hundred and sixty-five days a year; he said: As long as the determination is great, time must also obey. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, regardless of sunny or rainy weather, severe cold or hot weather, he started early and worked late, working hard and cleverly, doing a full four hundred and forty-five labor days throughout the year, setting up the first red flag of high work efficiency in the county and winning praise from the prefectural and county committees.
In order to master the law of high sweet potato yields, Tan Jipu's brothers cultivated improved varieties year after year. They rotated seven different varieties of potato seedlings according to different soil conditions and variety characteristics, so the yields were higher than usual. In addition, they also took the lead in implementing intercropping, using short-term crops to support long-term crops, and crop rotation systems, so that the sweet potato fields changed from one crop a year in the past to three crops a year, and the planting of cash crops was expanded year by year, changing the old custom of "only planting sweet potatoes for three years after opening the mountain." In 1958, thirteen commune members harvested 40,000 jin of grain, and also planted more than 2,000 fruit trees and palm trees, and raised eighteen fat pigs, receiving a large red flag from the county party committee with the words "Hard work blooms with happy flowers, leap forward bears happy fruits."
In the past five years, Tan Jipu has led his family and more than a dozen commune members to work hard on Baiyan Mountain. They did not avoid the scorching sun or fear the wind and frost, and worked all year round. Tan Jipu himself wore out seventeen mountain hoes during the five years of wasteland reclamation. These hard work have greatly changed the desolate appearance of Baiyan Mountain. The former rugged wasteland has become layers of lush sweet potato fields, and the mountain tops covered with stubborn stones in the past now grow into patches of fruit forests. Tan Jipu led the team members to use their diligent hands to cultivate and manage more than 100 mu of sweet potato fields, and seized 30,000 to 40,000 jin of grain and miscellaneous grains from the barren mountains every year, planted more than 2,000 fruit trees and more than ten kinds of cash crops, raised flocks of livestock and bees, and picked the first batch of delicious plum fruits. They sprinkled countless sweat of labor on the mountain, and also tasted the joy of harvest.

	Apprenticing to Learn Medicine, Collecting Prescriptions to Treat Commune Members
	Diligent Study, Tireless Teaching, Bringing Culture to the Mountain

The mountain climate is changeable, there are many insects and snakes, and accidents often occur during labor, so epidemics and injuries often threaten the health of commune members. Whenever a commune member was sick, Tan Jipu was very anxious. He was determined to take on the task of disease prevention and treatment for commune members, and he painstakingly learned various methods of treating diseases from others. Through continuous observation and experimentation, he identified the activity patterns and characteristics of various poisonous snakes, and the painful symptoms after poisonous snake bites, and learned different ways to treat various poisons. Team members Tan Bangyin, Tan Xuemei, etc. were bitten by poisonous snakes while cutting grass, and their wounds swelled instantly, and they were unconscious, but they were all rescued by Tan Jipu.
Many folk prescriptions are passed down secretly. Tan Jipu used his practical actions to care for the health of commune members to inspire others to offer secret recipes. An old farmer in Dayang Township, Tan Shihua, was a master of acupuncture therapy, and usually did not teach others. Once, the old man Tan Shihua went to the mountain to burn charcoal, and suddenly his stomach hurt unbearably. Tan Jipu rushed over after hearing the news and immediately used his own acupuncture to cure him. Then he asked Tan Shihua for advice, saying: "We people who work in the mountains all year round have to rely on ourselves when we have a pain, your acupuncture skills teach me, and I will help others again, the effect will be greater, and everyone will be grateful to you." Seeing that he was so enthusiastic about treating people and caring for everyone's health, Tan Shihua taught him his acupuncture skills on the mountain. In this way, Tan Jipu collected two or thirty kinds of commonly used herbs and prescriptions related to snake bites, heatstroke, falls, knife wounds, burns, as well as pain relief and hemostasis in the past few years.
He not only paid attention to treatment, but also paid attention to disease prevention. Whenever it was the peak season of summer and autumn, he would have each team member take various local medicinal teas and detoxification soups to prevent viruses. At the same time, in daily life, he cared about the health of the team members everywhere, often getting up in the middle of the night to go to the dormitory to cover the young people with quilts to prevent them from catching cold. If someone was not feeling well, he would administer medicine and ask his family to take care of them carefully.
In 1957, when a climax of cultural learning was set off in rural areas, the commune members said, "We are always on the mountain, we only know how to open up wasteland and cultivate land, when will it be our turn to get rid of the illiteracy cap?" Tan Jipu also thought: "Yes, what if we can't learn culture if we stay on the mountain for a long time?" Once, he returned to the village to report this situation to the Party branch, and the branch secretary Tan Lijin said, "Then you should also engage in cultural construction and run a civil school on the mountain!" Tan Jipu said, "We just can't find a teacher." Tan Lijin said, "You have read in private school and know more words than Zunxiang, so teach your son first and let him be a civil school teacher." This increased his confidence in bringing culture to the mountainous area.
In this winter, a civil school was established on the mountain, and the teacher was Tan Zunxiang. At this time, Tan Jipu also led the commune members to saw a few wooden boards, nailed four legs to make desks, dug a few large tree roots on the mountain and sawed them short to make chairs, and a wooden board coated with soot was a blackboard. For a period of time, there were no oil lamps, so "pine torches" were used instead. If there were not enough textbooks, several people shared a copy and took turns reading. Every day after dinner, the sound of reading was heard in the small thatched hut on the mountain. No matter how many or few people there were, the civil school has been persevering. Tan Zunxiang also went to the elementary school at the foot of the mountain to learn new songs, and he was sure to sing for a while after class every night. The pleasant singing made people forget that they were in the deep mountains.

    共产党员的英雄气概　人民干部的先进榜样
    新“愚公”檀积蒲带头征服白岩山
    奋战五年，开垦了荒山一百多亩，年产粮食三四万斤，把穷山变成了百宝山
    在福建省永泰县山区的广大群众中，传诵着一个动人心弦的“新愚公征服白岩山”的故事。这位新“愚公”就是大洋公社荷洋大队共产党员檀积蒲。他响应党的号召，带领妻子、儿女、兄弟和十多名耕山队员，发愤图强，坚韧不拔，先后在白岩山上艰苦奋战五年，把过去的穷山恶岭建设成为粮食成堆、果木成荫、禽畜成群、书声琅琅的新山区。
    迎着当前困难全家含笑搬上荒山
      展望幸福远景自己动手创建家园
    贫农出身的檀积蒲，十六岁就撑犁使耙，挑起了全家人的生活重担。十八岁那年，由于国民党反动派抓壮丁，他被迫躲进了深山，一直到解放时，度过了十五载漫长的耕山岁月。解放后，他走出深山，在党的领导下，参加土地改革分了田地，住上了新盖的瓦房。
    1955年秋天，檀积蒲领导的爱国农业社，获得了粮食增产近四成的大丰收，但全社粮食还不能全部自给。这时，檀积蒲便提出自己的宏愿：要用双手把大片荒山开成“粮仓”。经过踏勘，他决定开垦附近的白岩山。这座山山陡崖高，野兽横行，当时有些社员不愿去。由于人手太少，檀积蒲便又带上十四岁的长子檀遵祥做助手。临走前，党支部书记檀礼金对他说：“只要打好前锋，做出榜样，就会有更多人上山。”几个人挑起铺盖、锅子、山锄、柴刀，冒着冬寒，踏着崎岖山路上了白岩山。
    1957年冬天，全民大跃进的序幕揭开了，檀积蒲光荣当选为全县农业劳动模范。党给了他光荣，也给了他鼓舞。他更清楚地认清了建设山区增产粮食的重要意义。于是，他打定主意：干脆把全家搬上山去，长期建设山区。
    他回到老家找他的弟弟檀积艾商量。积艾曾经上山帮过工，早有心长期耕山，一说就妥。檀积蒲满心高兴去找妻子鄢英英商量，妻子犹豫了一会说，“过去我跟着你长年跑大山，住茅屋，啃野菜，我没说过半句怨言。如今熬出头了，住上新瓦房，好不容易过了这几年的安适生活，怎舍得走开呢？”檀积蒲望着宽敞舒适的新屋，抚摸着跟前三个小女儿，心里暗想：“是啊！解放前她来到檀家门，哪里住过一天好瓦房，有过一天好生活，现在又让她再到大山去受风险，难怪她舍不得啊！”可他又想：“要是每个人都这样想，社会主义怎能建成？”他便耐心地说：“英英，你可曾想到，过去是谁逼着我们上山住茅屋？现在是谁使我们翻身住新房？如今再上山、再去住茅屋又是为了什么呢？”英英是个知情识理的人，想想过去，看看现在，她激动地说：“这还不明白，过去是反动派地主逼我们上山住茅屋；没有共产党，我们一辈子也翻不过身，住不上新房。如今再上山当然跟过去不同，你不是常说是为了社会主义嘛！”说完，夫妻俩都笑了。檀积蒲说：“对呀！现在上山是为了建设社会主义，将来能住上比这还要好的新楼房，那就搬家吧！”
    檀积蒲领着一家大小十人，收拾了行装、家具，带着鸡鸭兔子，告别了亲人，离开才住了几年的新楼房，欢欢喜喜地搬到山上去了。许多人被这一家人长期开发山区的雄心壮志所感动，连原先不愿上山的人也说：“他拖家带口能上山，我还有什么话说。”于是，又有许多人要求上山了。
      披荆斩棘平山筑堤遍撒劳动汗珠
        果树成林家畜成群饱尝丰收喜悦
    在更多的人上山之后，开始当然有不少的困难。就以生活来说，檀积蒲全家大小十人起先挤在两所狭小的茅屋里，下大雨就漏，刮大风还会把茅盖掀掉。山上满目荒凉，夜间野兽出没，孩子们出去经常是提心吊胆的，其他社员开始也过得不惯。然而这一切，对有着社会主义觉悟和过惯耕山生活的檀积蒲兄弟全不在话下。他们经常回忆解放前披麻袋、吃番薯渣、野菜的苦日子，憧憬着山区建设的美好前景，教导孩子们跟荒山建立新的感情，让孩子们在风风雨雨中磨练得更加坚强。社员们见了他们全家这样不畏艰苦，也不把生活的困难放在心上了。
    但是，更大的困难还是在生产上。白岩山上十五道湾，湾湾长满簇密锐利的大茅芦草。要开荒，人钻进去，听得见谈话看不到面；一出来，脸上、手上、腿上都有可能被刺破。有一次，十几个队员在一起劈草开荒，有的人坚持不了；退下了山坡；檀积蒲却坚持不退，带着兄弟檀积艾和十七岁的儿子遵祥坚持干下去。下山的人们看到他们这股顽强劲，再也不把利草放在心上，又互相鼓励着往前劈去。
    就是这样，耕山队终于沿着山溪两岸开垦了大片番薯园。但山洪一来，番薯园里的肥土往往被冲走，薯苗也常常被损坏。于是，檀积蒲又领着大伙冒着腊月严寒修筑防洪堤。泡在水里抬石头、砌石基是个艰苦的重活，他就跳到二尺深的水中带头干。有一回，檀积蒲害了病，还是扶着拐杖到现场检查工程质量，进行技术指导。队员们都感动了，个个顶着寒风泡在冷水里使劲干，终于修筑成四条长达四十三丈多的防洪堤堰，挡住了山洪，保住了劳动果实。檀积蒲心中有征服白岩山的大志，身上就有用不完的力气。人们说：一年出满勤也只能做三百六十五天；他说：只要决心大，时间也要听使唤。大跃进的1958年，不论晴雨风霜，严寒酷热，他都起早摸黑，苦干巧干，全年整整做了四百四十五个劳动工日，树起全县第一面高工效红旗，获得地委和县委的表扬。
    檀积蒲兄弟为了掌握番薯高产规律，连年培育良种。他们按照不同土壤条件和品种特性，轮种七个不同品种的薯苗，因而产量都比一般高。此外，他们还带头实行套种间种、以短养长和轮作制度，番薯园从过去的一年一熟变成一年三熟，而且逐年扩大种植经济作物，改变了“开山只种三年薯”的老惯例。1958年，十三个社员收了粮食四万斤，还种了二千多株果树、棕树，养了十八头肥猪，得到了县委奖励的一面“苦战开满幸福花，跃进结满幸福果”的大红旗。
    五年来，檀积蒲率领全家和十多个社员，在白岩山上艰苦奋斗，他们不避烈日，不畏风霜，终年劳动，光檀积蒲本人在五年垦荒生活期间磨损的山锄镢头就达十七把。这些辛勤劳动使得白岩山的荒凉面貌大大改变了。昔日崎岖荒坡，成了一层层油绿茂盛的番薯园，过去顽石遍地的山头，现在长出了成片果林。檀积蒲领导队员们用勤劳的双手，开垦经营了一百多亩番薯园，每年向荒山夺取三四万斤粮食和杂粮，种植了二千多株果树和十多种经济作物，养了成群的家畜和蜜蜂，采摘了第一批鲜美的李果，他们在山上撒遍无数劳动的汗珠，也饱尝着丰收的喜悦。
      拜师学医搜集单方给社员治病
        勤思苦学诲人不倦带文化上山
    山间气候多变，虫蛇又多，加上劳动中发生碰伤事故，疫病伤痛时常威胁着社员的健康。檀积蒲每遇社员有病痛，心里就十分焦急。他下决心把社员的防病治伤工作担负起来，他向人苦心学习各种治病方法。他从不断观察、试验中，识别各种毒蛇的活动规律、特性，和毒蛇咬伤后的发痛症状，学会了治疗各种毒害的不同办法。队员檀邦银、檀雪梅等在劈草时被毒蛇咬了，刹那间伤口肿大，人事不省，但都被檀积蒲急救过来。
    民间流传许多单方，秘不传人。檀积蒲便以自己关心社员健康的实际行动，去启发别人献出秘方。大洋乡有个老农檀仕华是针灸疗法的名手，平时不教旁人。有一次，檀仕华老汉上山烧炭，突然肚子疼得难当，檀积蒲闻讯赶来，立即用自己针法给他治好，接着他就向檀仕华求教说：“我们常年做山的人，有个病痛就得靠自己，你的针法教给我，我再帮助别人，作用就更大，大伙都会感激你的。”檀仕华见他这样热心为人治病，关心大家健康，就在山上把自己的针法授给他。就这样，檀积蒲几年来搜集到的有关蛇咬、中暑、跌伤、刀伤、烫伤以及止痛、止血等常用的草药、验方就达二、三十种。
    他不但注意治疗，也注意防病，每当盛夏季节和秋冬气候多变时，他都要每个队员服用各种土药茶和解毒汤，预防病毒。同时在日常生活上，处处关心队员们的健康，经常三更半夜起身，到宿舍里给年青人盖上被子防止受冻，谁的身体不舒服，他就一面施药，一面叫家里人细心照顾。
    1957年当农村掀起文化学习的高潮时，社员们都说：“我们常年在山上，只知道开荒种地，什么时候才轮到脱掉文盲帽子呢？”檀积蒲也想：“对呵，长期在山上，学不到文化怎么办呢？”有一次，他回村向党支部汇报这种情况，支部书记檀礼金说：“那你们也搞文化建设，就在山上办个民校吧！” 檀积蒲说：“就是找不到教员。”檀礼金说：“你是念过私塾的，比遵祥多识些字，就先教你儿子，让他当民校教师。”这一说，使他增强了把文化带进山区的信心。
    就在这年冬天，山上成立了一所民校，教员就是檀遵祥。这时檀积蒲又带着社员们锯几块木板，钉上四条腿当课桌，到山上挖几棵大树根锯短做椅子，一块木板涂上乌烟就是黑板，有个时期，没有油灯，就点“松明”来代替，课本不够，几个人合用一册，轮着读。每天晚饭后，山上小茅屋里便传出琅琅书声。不管人多人少，民校一直坚持下来。檀遵祥还到山下小学里学唱新歌，每晚上完课就必定唱一阵，那愉快的歌声，更使人忘掉是置身在深山中了。
