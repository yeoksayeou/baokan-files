Quality First - At the Kunming Xishan Agricultural Machinery Factory

	The Eighteenth Improvement
	These days, commune members of the Tuanshan Management Area of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Kunming City, Yunnan Province, are driving newly made "soil crushing and sowing dual-purpose seeding harrows" to sow spring crops. According to technical appraisals by relevant departments, it weighs 70 kilograms, costs only one-tenth of the "foreign" seeders, is suitable for sowing in clay soil, requires only two people to operate and two oxen to pull, and can sow 28 to 30 mu per day with good sowing quality.
	This dual-purpose seeding harrow embodies the labor of many people. It was early October. The autumn harvest in the Xishan district was coming to an end, and the comprehensive autumn planting was about to begin. In order to seize the season, the Xishan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on the entire district to vigorously carry out agricultural tool reforms and assigned the task of trial-producing seeding harrows to the vehicle factory. The workers immediately started working and made an eight-row seeder in a few days. They took it to the mountains for trial use, and the effect was very good, so they immediately organized forces for production. However, the only drawback was that the fields in the Xishan district are mostly clay soil with high viscosity. When using the eight-row seeder to sow wheat, the harrow teeth easily get blocked after being inserted into the soil, resulting in uneven sowing and low efficiency, making it impossible to promote it comprehensively. Time was tight, and the season was pressing. What to do? The next day, the First Secretary of the District Committee and responsible comrades from industrial, financial and trade, and commercial departments led a group of cadres to the Xishan District Agricultural Machinery Factory, asking the factory to find a way to modify a seeding harrow suitable for clay soil. The factory's employees knew that the task was urgent, so the Party Branch Secretary personally took charge, and selected experienced master craftsmen and technical personnel to form a team for trial production. They brought in an eight-row seeder and adopted the method of dissecting the "sparrow," disassembling all the parts one by one for analysis, and pooling everyone's wisdom for modification. The District Committee Secretary also participated in the improvement based on the principle of the seeding harrow. With everyone contributing ideas, they modified one on the same day and took it to the field for testing, but the wheat could not be sown. They then looked for the cause and improved it. After eighteen improvements, at the end of October, the first soil crushing and sowing dual-purpose seeding harrow was successfully modified, and the clay soil sowing work was also equipped with new agricultural tools.

专栏：质量第一——在昆明西山农业机械厂里

    第十八次改进
    这几天，云南省昆明市东风人民公社团山管理区的社员们，正驾驶着新制的“碎土下种两用播种耙”，在播种小春。据有关部门的技术鉴定：它全重七十公斤，成本仅及“洋”播种机的十分之一，适宜于胶泥地播种，只要两个人操作，两条牛牵引，一天就可以下种二十八亩到三十亩，而且播种质量很好。
    这台两用播种耙包含着许多人的劳动。那是10月初的事情。西山区的秋收快要结束了，全面的秋种将要开始。为了抢节令，中共西山区委号召全区大搞农具改革，并把试制播种耙的工作交给车辆厂去完成。工人们说干就干，立即动手，几天功夫就制成了一台八行播种机，抬到山地试用，效果很好，马上就组织力量生产。但是，美中不足的是：西山区的田地多系胶泥土，粘性大，使用八行播种机下种小麦，耙齿插入泥土后容易阻塞，播种不均匀，工效也低，不能全面推广。时间紧迫，节令催人，如何办？第二天，区委第一书记和工业、财贸、商业等部门的负责同志带领着一批干部，亲自来到了西山区农业机械厂，要求这个厂想办法改制一台适合胶泥地的播种耙。这个厂的职工深知任务紧迫，立即由党支部书记亲自挂帅，选派技术较强的老师傅和技术人员组成小组，进行试制。他们抬来一台八行播种机，采取解剖“麻雀”的办法，将全部机件拆开来逐一分析，集中大家的智慧修改。区委书记也根据播种耙的原理，参与改进。你一计，我一窍，当天就改制出了一台，大家拿到田间试验，但麦子播不下来。他们又找原因、改进。这样经过了十八次改进，10月底，第一台碎土下种两用播种耙改造成功了，胶泥地的播种工作也使上了新农具。
