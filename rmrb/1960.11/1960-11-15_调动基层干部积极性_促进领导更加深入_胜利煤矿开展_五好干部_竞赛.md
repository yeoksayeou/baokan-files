Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, November 14th: Fushun Victory Mine, on the basis of implementing the "office work in the pit" system, has launched a large-scale competition to become "Five-Good Cadres." Through this competition, the "office work in the pit" system has been further developed, greatly improving the enthusiasm and work efficiency of grassroots cadres, and powerfully promoting the development of the increase production and practice economy campaign.

The content and methods of the "Five-Good Cadre" competition are: cadres at the mine (all departments), district, team, and group levels, all focusing on improving leadership style and leadership methods, using the "Five-Good" conditions (good at listening to the Party and completing tasks; good at taking the lead in tackling key production problems; good at unity and cooperation; good at consulting with the masses; good at laboring alongside the masses) as specific competition content, implementing hierarchical links, and carrying out opponent competitions with each other.

Since the launch of the "Five-Good Cadre" competition, it has further stimulated the enthusiasm of leading cadres to go into production to lead production and to go among the masses to lead production, and further strengthened their confidence in working in the pit. Leading cadres of the coal mining workshop moved their offices from the level roadways to the working face in the competition, solving problems on the spot as soon as they were discovered. "Five-Good" cadre Zhang Fuhua, deputy district chief of Coal Mining District 5, summarized a set of working methods based on his experience of working in the pit during the competition: before entering the pit, find out the plan completion situation of the first two shifts of the day; after entering the pit, spend an hour or so checking the working faces and giving general instructions; if the most difficult and weakest link of the shift is discovered, immediately squat down and lead the masses to tackle the problem; after concentrating on tackling the problem, hold a "position meeting" of team leaders on a regular basis to decide on the balance of the shift; in the remaining three hours of the shift, concentrate the superior forces of the entire district to tackle the problem. At the end of September, after he implemented this working method, he quickly turned the originally low-yield night shift (the shift he commanded) into a high-yield shift. Now, his working method has been widely promoted throughout the mine.

The "Five-Good Cadre" competition has prompted the leadership style of cadres at all levels in the mine to become more and more in-depth and practical, and the confidence of the broad masses of workers in completing tasks has become stronger and stronger, and their enthusiasm has become greater and greater. Under the impetus of the "Five-Good" cadre competition, eleven workshops, fifty-eight teams, and two hundred and eighty-four groups in the entire mine have launched linking competitions and opponent competitions, thereby promoting production levels to be higher every ten days.

    调动基层干部积极性  促进领导更加深入
    胜利煤矿开展“五好干部”竞赛
    据新华社抚顺14日电　抚顺胜利矿领导干部在实行“井下办公”制度的基础上，展开了争当
  “五好干部”的大竞赛。通过这种竞赛，“井下办公制度”有了进一步的发展，大大提高了基层干部积极性和工作效率，有力地促进了增产节约运动的开展。
      “五好干部”竞赛的内容和做法是：矿（各科室）、区、班、组四级干部，都以改进领导作风和领导方法为中心，以“五好”条件（听党的话，完成任务好；带头攻克生产关键好；团结协作好；同群众商量好；同群众一道劳动好）为具体竞赛内容，实行层层挂钩，互相开展对手赛。
      “五好干部”竞赛展开以后，是进一步地发挥了领导干部到生产中去领导生产、到群众中去领导生产的积极性，更坚定了到井下办公的信心。采煤车间领导干部在竞赛中把办公地点从平巷搬到掌子头，就地发现问题就地解决。“五好”干部、采煤五区副区长张富华，在竞赛中根据自己到井下办公后的体会，总结出了一套工作方法：入井前摸清当天头两个班完成计划的情况；入井后花个把钟头溜掌子，进行一般性的指挥；发现当班最困难、最薄弱的环节，立刻蹲下来，带领群众攻关；集中攻关后，定时召开班组长“阵地碰头会”，决定当班平衡；在当班余下的三小时内，集中全区优势力量攻关。9月末，他实行这一工作方法以后，很快使原来低产的夜班（他指挥的一班）变成了高产班。现在，他的工作方法已经在全矿普遍推广。
    “五好干部”竞赛促使矿上各级干部的领导作风越来越深入、踏实，广大职工群众完成任务的信心也越来越足，干劲越来越大。在“五好”干部竞赛的带动下，全矿有十一个车间、五十八个班、二百八十四个小组，都展开了挂钩赛、对手赛，从而促使生产水平一旬高于一旬。
