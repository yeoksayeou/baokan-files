A Small Note on Re-harvesting Peanuts
Xiǎo Tāo

　　One day at noon, the county party secretary and us went to Han Gezhuang Brigade of Xitian Gezhuang Commune in Miyun County to participate in labor. The deputy captain introduced the situation to us, saying: "Today, our party branch secretary is re-harvesting peanuts with the commune members..." He pointed to a peanut field to the south and said: "This field has already been harvested four times, and this morning five sacks of peanuts were harvested from this field! Now it can be considered completely harvested!"
　　After the county party secretary bent down to inspect the peanut field, he said: "How about we leave some people here to re-harvest one more time?"
　　"This field has already been completely harvested!" Several commune members reminded the secretary.
　　"Let us try again." As a result of the discussion, ten people were left behind to continue re-harvesting.
　　An hour later, two mu of peanut fields had been re-harvested. Everyone's baskets contained what seemed like a small amount of peanuts, but when we put the peanuts together, it was half a bag. After several people weighed it, it was at least more than fifteen jin.
　　While continuing to harvest peanuts, the county party secretary chatted with the commune members about everyday matters: "How did you harvest peanuts in the past?"
　　The commune member next to him said: "At that time, every family grew peanuts, and they would only harvest once. Many peanuts were thrown away on the ground in vain. How could each household manage it! Now it is much better. After the first harvest, there are three or four re-harvests. Harvested so carefully, truly no grain is lost!"
　　The county party secretary smiled and asked again: "Then do you think this kind of field needs to be re-harvested again?"
　　Some commune members replied: "Another re-harvest is possible, but if only a few jin of peanuts are harvested per mu, and one person can't harvest ten or twenty jin a day, it's a bit uneconomical..."
　　Is it economical or not?
　　On the way back from work in the evening, the secretary calculated with us. He said: "Today, we re-harvested peanuts on a peanut field that had already been harvested four times by the commune members, and each mu can still yield five or six jin of peanuts. It seems that the average re-harvest of ten jin of peanuts per mu in the whole commune is no problem, right?"
　　The commune member walking next to him said: "Peanuts are something that can never be completely harvested. As long as you put in the effort, let alone ten jin, fifteen jin can be harvested!"
　　"Yes, let's calculate based on ten jin of peanuts per mu! Ten jin per mu is a very small number, but the whole commune planted 44,000 mu of peanuts this year, which can harvest 440,000 jin, which can produce more than 100,000 jin of oil. How long can it feed more than 50,000 people in the entire commune? This number is not small!"
　　From this calculation, we and the commune members sincerely realized the importance of re-harvesting peanuts.
　　The county party secretary continued: "As for the value of spending a day to harvest a few jin, or more than a dozen jin, this cannot be calculated solely based on income. Although one person harvesting a few jin of peanuts a day doesn't bring in as much money as engaging in sideline occupations, after this time, you'll have to wait until next year to harvest a few jin of peanuts. You can engage in sideline occupations whenever you have time. Our work must clearly distinguish between primary and secondary tasks to be done well."
　　That evening, the county party secretary also exchanged opinions with the first secretary of the Xitian Gezhuang Commune Party Committee on this matter.
　　A few days later, we saw a report from Xitian Gezhuang Commune: From October 23rd to 26th, the entire commune organized more than 5,400 people, led by the commune, brigade, and production team secretaries, to launch a re-harvesting peanut campaign. In three days, they re-harvested more than 50,000 jin of peanuts!

    复收花生小记
    晓涛
    一天中午，县委书记和我们到密云县西田各庄公社韩各庄大队参加劳动。副队长向我们介绍情况说：“今天，我们党支部书记同社员一起去复收花生了……”他用手指指道南的一块花生地说：“这块地已经收过四次了，今天上午还从这片地里收出五麻袋花生呢！现在才算收净！”
    县委书记弯身检查一下花生地以后说：“我们留一部分人在这里再收一遍好吧？”
    “这块地已经收净了！”几个社员在提醒书记。
    “让我们再试试看吧。”商量的结果，还是留下十个人在这里继续复收。
    一个小时以后，复收了二亩花生地，每个人的提篮里都有看来不多的花生，但是，当我们把花生都放在一起的时候，却是半口袋，经过几个人称量，至少在十五斤以上。
    县委书记一边继续收花生，一边和社员谈论起家常来：“过去收花生是怎么个收法？”
    紧靠他旁边的社员说：“那个时候家家种花生，都是收一次算完事，不少花生都白白扔在地里，一家一户哪弄得过来呢！现在好多了，前面一次，后面要经过三、四次的复收，照这样仔细呀，真是颗粒无丢呢！”
    县委书记笑着又问：“那么像这样的地是否需要再收一次？”
    有的社员回答：“再收一次还可以，可是一亩地只收几斤花生，一个人一天收不了十斤、二十斤的，就有些不合算了……”
    倒底合算不合算呢？
    在晚上收工回来的路上，书记同志同我们算了一笔账。他说：“今天我们在已经被社员收了四次的花生地上复收，每亩还能收出五、六斤花生来。看来全公社平均每亩复收十斤花生是没问题的吧？”
    走在他旁边的社员说：“花生，就是收不净的东西，只要下功夫，不用说十斤，十五斤也能收得出来呀！”
      “对，我们就以每亩地十斤花生计算吧！一亩地收十斤是个很小的数字，但是全公社今年种了四万四千亩花生，就能收四十四万斤，可以出十多万斤油，可供全公社五万多人食用多久呢？这个数字可不小啊！”
    从这一笔账上，我们和社员们都心悦诚服地认识到复收花生的重要。
    县委书记继续说下去：“至于一个人一天收几斤，或者十几斤所花费的价值问题，这不能光算收入账。尽管一个人一天收几斤花生，不如搞副业来钱多。但是过了这个时候，再想收几斤花生就得明年了，搞副业什么时候有功夫，就在什么时候搞，我们的工作必须这样分清主次，才能搞得好。”
    当晚，县委书记又同西田各庄公社党委第一书记就这件事情交换了意见。
    过了几天，我们看到了西田各庄公社写来了这样一份报告：全公社从10月23日到26日，组成五千四百多人，由公社、大队、生产队各级书记带领，展开了复收花生的活动。三天来共复收花生五万多斤了！
