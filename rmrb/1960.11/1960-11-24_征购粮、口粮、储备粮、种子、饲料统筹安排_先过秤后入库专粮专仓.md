Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 23rd: Hebei Province is taking advantage of the favorable opportunity after the basic completion of autumn harvest and wheat planting to launch a high tide of autumn grain purchase and storage, with grasping and doing a good job of weighing and storing as the central link. Since November, the province's grain storage progress has been increasing daily, and now seven counties (districts), one hundred and nine communes, and more than five thousand seven hundred production teams have completed the task of autumn grain sales and storage.

Strictly implementing the method of weighing and storing is the prominent feature of Hebei Province's grain purchase and distribution work this year. The purchased grain is weighed into the national granary, and the retained grain is weighed into the granary of the basic accounting unit (production brigade), all arranged in an orderly manner. Grain departments at all levels have sent a large number of cadres to production teams and grain receiving stations to specifically participate in and guide the grain weighing and inspection work. In every production team throughout the province, whether it is grain sold to the state or grain kept by the brigade itself, whether it is rations for members or reserve grain, seed grain, and fodder grain, all are weighed before being stored. Local production teams have also universally achieved separate storage of rations, seed grain, fodder grain, and reserve grain. During the weighing and storage process, state cadres, production team cadres, and representatives selected by the members jointly inspect the weight and quality to ensure that the stored grain is of guaranteed quality and quantity, and the weight is accurate.

The method of weighing and storing grain has enabled the vast majority of production teams to promptly determine grain yields, retain sufficient rations, seed grain, and fodder grain for members, and achieve overall consideration of the interests of the state, the collective, and the members, with comprehensive arrangements for life and production.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 23rd: In this year's grain purchase work, Heilongjiang Province has distributed all state grain purchase funds to the management areas (basic accounting units) of the people's communes. The management areas sell grain and simultaneously pre-distribute the grain money received from the bank to the members, so that the policy of work point evaluation and distribution according to labor is implemented in a timely manner, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of the masses to sell grain.

Currently, along the Songhua River-Nen River Plain railway line, there is a busy scene of selling and transporting grain everywhere. On the highways surrounding the stations, hundreds of vehicle convoys loaded with various grains are delivering them to the state granaries. All communes have cleaned up the grain thoroughly, delivering good grain and delivering grain quickly to the state. According to the statistics of the Yian County Grain Depot, first and second-grade soybeans accounted for 70%.

At the beginning of this year's grain purchase work, Heilongjiang Province conducted policy education for the cadres of the people's commune management areas and the vast number of members, and meticulously arranged for the lives of the masses. All localities deliver grain by management area, and also settle accounts by management area. After the management area's grain transport team unloads the grain, they immediately receive a grain payment voucher from the bank, which can be used to collect the grain money from the bank at any time. This ensures that the management area can make pre-distributions on time. Currently, management areas of people's communes throughout the province have generally begun pre-distributions. In many areas that have completed pre-distribution work, the income of 90% of the members has increased compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, November 23rd: Grain purchase work in rural Qinghai has entered a high tide. The vast number of members are stepping up threshing and enthusiastically selling grain to support national construction. Since the middle of the month, the province's grain storage progress has generally accelerated.

Qinghai Province's grain purchase work this year has been meticulous and solid. Adhering to the spirit of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangements, they have ensured the implementation of purchase grain, seeds, fodder, and rations for the masses, and achieved weighing and storing all grain, implementing special grain in special bins, and management by special personnel. This has both promoted the progress of grain purchase and storage and arranged for the lives of the masses.

Now, the communes and production teams that have completed the grain purchase task have invested in winter production centered on accumulating fertilizer, delivering fertilizer, turning over the soil, and sowing winter wheat, actively preparing for next year's production. The vast number of members of the communes and teams that have not yet completed the purchase task are actively threshing, striving to complete the grain sales task in the shortest possible time, so as to free up time and energy to engage in autumn and winter production.

    征购粮、口粮、储备粮、种子、饲料统筹安排
    先过秤后入库专粮专仓
    河北五千七百个生产队完成交售入库任务  黑龙江认真贯彻政策，群众 快交粮交好粮  青海工作细致扎实交售粮和口粮全部落实
    据新华社天津23日电　河北省农村乘秋收种麦基本结束的有利时机，掀起了以抓紧抓好过秤入仓为中心环节的秋粮征购入库高潮。11月份以来，全省粮食入库进度天天上升，现在已经有七个县（区）、一百零九个公社、五千七百多个生产队完成了秋粮交售入库任务。
    严格执行过秤入仓办法，是河北省今年粮食收购、分配工作的突出特点。征购粮过秤入国库，留粮过秤入基本核算单位生产大队粮库，都安排得有条不紊。各级粮食部门下放大批干部到生产队、接粮站，具体参加和指导粮食过秤验斤工作。全省各个生产大队，不论是向国家交售的粮食，还是大队自行保管的粮食，不论是社员口粮，还是储备粮、种子粮和饲料粮，都先过秤后入库。各地生产队还普遍作到了口粮、种子粮、饲料粮和储备粮分库分存。在过秤入库中，国家干部、生产队干部和社员选派的代表共同检斤验质，作到入库粮食保质保量，斤两不差。
    粮食过秤入仓的办法使绝大多数生产队及时地落实了粮食产量，留足了社员的口粮、生产用种子粮和饲料粮，作到了国家、集体、社员三方面利益统筹兼顾，生活和生产全面安排。
    新华社哈尔滨23日电　黑龙江省各地在今年的粮食征购工作中，把国家购粮款项全部发到人民公社的管理区（基本核算单位），管理区一面交售粮食，一面把从银行领来的粮款预分给社员，使评工记分、按劳分配的政策及时兑现，群众交售粮食的积极性很高。
    目前，沿松（花江）嫩（江）平原铁路线，到处是交售、运送粮食的繁忙景象，在各车站周围的公路上，成千上百辆的送粮车队把满载的各种粮食送到国家粮库。各公社都把粮食收拾得干干净净，向国家交好粮、快交粮。据依安县粮库统计，他们接受的大豆中，一、二等品就占70％。
    今年黑龙江省各地在征购粮食工作一开始，就向人民公社管理区的干部和广大社员进行了政策教育，并且细致地安排了群众生活。各地都以管理区为单位送粮，同时又以管理区为单位进行结算。管理区的送粮队卸完粮食以后，立即得到银行支付的粮款单据，可以随时到银行领取粮款。这样就保证了管理区按时预分。目前，全省各人民公社的管理区已经普遍开始预分。许多完成预分工作的地区，90％的社员收入比去年增加。
    新华社西宁23日电　青海农村粮食征购工作进入高潮。广大社员纷纷突击打碾，踊跃交售粮食，支援国家建设。中旬以来，全省粮食入库进度普遍加快。
    青海省今年粮食征购工作做得细致扎实。他们本着统筹兼顾、全面安排的精神，做到了收购粮、种子、饲料、群众口粮落实，并做到所有粮食过秤入仓，实行专粮专仓，专人保管。这样，既促进了粮食的征购入库进度，又安排好了群众生活。
    现在，已经完成粮食征购任务的公社、生产队已投入以积肥、送肥、翻地和春麦冬播为中心的冬季生产，积极为明年生产作准备。还没有完成征购任务的社、队的广大社员正积极进行打碾，力争在最短时间内完成粮食交售任务，以便腾出时间和力量大搞秋冬生产。
