    The Xihu Brigade Party Branch of the Xigang Commune in Helan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, has comprehensively implemented the Party's various guidelines and policies, ensuring that policies meet the masses in a timely manner. As a result, the production enthusiasm of commune members has been mobilized in all aspects, guaranteeing the rapid development of various production sectors and transforming the brigade from a poor one into a prosperous one.

    In June 1959, when the brigade's 3,400 mu of wheat was heading and filling, it suddenly encountered a hailstorm, with the affected area accounting for 88.5% of the total summer crop area. At this critical moment, Wang Zhiguo, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, and Zhang Cheng, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, arrived and held various meetings to encourage the brigade's cadres and commune members to establish a firm ambition to overcome the disaster. However, cadres and the masses had different understandings of which specific measures needed to be taken. Some said, "If agriculture is lost, find sideline occupations"; others said, "There are not many avenues for sideline occupations, and the profits are not great, so let the state provide relief!" In response to these situations, the Commune Party Committee led everyone in a debate. Through the debate, all cadres and commune members realized that only by resolutely implementing the Party's policy of "taking grain as the key link, diversifying operations, and developing in an all-round way" could production be developed correctly. On this basis, the Brigade Party Branch put forward the slogan "If summer is lost, find it in autumn; if grain is lost, find it in grain," and fully launched a mass movement to fight the disaster and seize a bumper harvest. Before the start of the movement, the commune allocated 10,000 yuan to them free of charge and transported 70,000 jin of chemical fertilizer and more than 40,000 jin of seeds, feed, rapeseed, etc. The commune's tractor station sent two tractors, and other brother brigades also actively supported them. As a result, the brigade not only planted millet and sorghum on nearly 3,000 mu of affected land but also expanded planting by more than 1,000 mu. After the rush planting and replanting were completed, the entire brigade mobilized commune members to find 18 avenues for diversified operations. In addition to retaining enough field management personnel, the brigade also extracted more than 100 people to engage in forestry, ironwork, animal husbandry, fishing, weaving, raising chickens, ducks, rabbits, transportation, and other sideline occupations, earning more than 40,000 yuan in three months. The brigade used the money earned from sideline occupations to improve the lives of commune members, purchase 70,000 jin of urea fertilizer, 15 iron-wheeled plows, and various vehicles, which were used in production that year and achieved significant results. After half a year of hard work, grain crops and diversified operations achieved a double bumper harvest, and the total agricultural income exceeded that of 1958. This fact fully educated all cadres and the vast number of commune members: resolutely implementing the Party's guidelines and policies is a reliable guarantee for the eternal victory of all work. Yang Shengxuan, the secretary of the brigade's Party branch, said: Once the Party's policies are grasped by the masses, they will become a huge material force.

    Inspired by this event, the cadres further strengthened the policy education of the masses, making the Party's policies known to every household and every person. The specific methods adopted by the brigade's Party branch were: (1) Combining meeting dissemination with door-to-door explanation. After each policy was issued, the brigade's Party branch first held a meeting of cadres, Party members, League members, and activists to disseminate it; after they understood the spirit of the policy, they divided up the work and went to the masses to publicize it. In this way, the Party's policies could be quickly grasped by the masses. (2) Grasping the elderly, weak commune members, and backward commune members to eliminate blind spots in policy propaganda. Some elderly and weak commune members often could not attend commune member meetings due to their physical condition. However, they had rich production experience, and if they lacked understanding of the Party's policies, they could not play their due role. It was even more necessary to strengthen ideological education for commune members with backward thinking and publicize the Party's various guidelines and policies to them, thereby raising their ideological awareness. Therefore, for these two types of people, the Party branch adopted the method of delivering policies to their doorsteps, which achieved good results. (3) Combining reading newspapers, putting policies on the wall, and implementing policies on the ground. This was an effective way to make commune members often familiar with policies. Generally, each production team insisted on reading newspapers in the fields and canteens, studying the Party's policies and various production experiences; at the same time, after each policy was communicated, they wrote slogans and posted them in various canteens, and wrote them on blackboards and brought them to the fields, repeatedly publicizing them to commune members to ensure that policies were deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. (4) Organizing propaganda teams to publicize the guidelines and policies of each period to the masses. Whenever a Party policy was issued, the Party branch would communicate it to the teachers and students of the entire brigade, and then they would form a propaganda team to widely publicize it to the masses. Since the beginning of this year, this method has been adopted for publicizing the policy of simultaneously promoting multiple harvests and high-yield harvests and vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. (5) Distributing propaganda materials. The Brigade Party Branch took into account that the cultural level of grassroots cadres was generally low, and simply holding meetings for dissemination could not achieve the desired effect. In order to make up for this shortcoming, they often compiled easy-to-understand materials based on the spirit of the Party's policies and distributed them to small team cadres. Small team cadres said, "With this material, we have overcome the shortcoming of 'carrying a load to the meeting and only having half left when we return'."

    In implementing the Party's various policies, the Xihu Brigade Party Branch carried forward the spirit of seeking truth from facts, adhering to the Party's policy principles while integrating with specific circumstances. In order to achieve this, they always followed the mass line, consulting with commune members on everything. In consulting with the masses, they correctly implemented the class line, relying not only on Party members and League members but also closely relying on poor and lower-middle peasants. In the measures to increase production, they paid special attention to learning from old peasants and consulted them on everything. When formulating production plans, the Brigade Party Branch first conducted repeated research based on the specific requirements of the commune and combined with the actual situation of the brigade, then put forward preliminary opinions, handed them over to the masses for discussion, and then modified them based on the opinions of the masses before bringing them back to the masses for discussion. This "three up and three down" working method ensured that production targets were based on an active and reliable foundation. For example, when formulating this year's production plan, the branch initially proposed a target of 420 jin per mu for the average wheat yield, and then each branch committee member went to the work groups to hold meetings of old peasants and commune members for discussion. Based on past experience, the old peasants believed that the soil in Xihu was barren and alkaline, and that the scale of large-scale production increase was too large, which could lead to failure. Each production team also analyzed the soil conditions of their own team block by block and formulated different production targets according to the actual situation. Taking wheat as an example, the production target of the first team was 360 jin per mu, the second team was 370 jin, and the fifth team was 340 jin. After the production targets of each team were formulated, the entire brigade adopted a method combining cadres, old peasants, and commune members to conduct a review, and then the Brigade Party Branch balanced the new plan before finally implementing the plan and implementing "three guarantees" to each team. The production targets formulated in this way were active and reliable, and the commune members felt that as long as the production measures kept up, surpassing the contracted output was promising. Therefore, a new upsurge of production emerged in each contracting unit to add more production-increasing measures and strive to exceed the contracted output. After the wheat harvest this year, how to further implement the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" of "multiple harvests and high-yield harvests" was a very important issue. Wang Gong, deputy secretary of the Brigade Party Branch, went to Wang Zishan, who was over 80 years old, to discuss it with him. Based on his more than 60 years of accumulated experience that "if it doesn't rain during the Beginning of Summer, there will definitely be more autumn rain," Wang Zishan proposed planting a large amount of small millet, which would definitely yield more than large millet. The Party branch accepted this opinion, and the original plan was to replant more than 500 mu in the entire brigade, but they actually planted more than 600 mu. As a result, the yield of small millet was higher than that of large millet.

    西湖大队党支部做到政策和群众及时见面
    在贯彻党的政策时，既坚持原则，又结合具体情况，充分调动了社员生产积极性
    本报讯　宁夏回族自治区贺兰县习岗公社西湖大队全面地贯彻执行了党的各项方针政策，使政策及时和群众见面，因而从各个方面调动了社员的生产积极性，保证了各项生产的迅速发展，由穷队变成了富队。
    1959年6月，全队三千四百亩小麦正在抽穗灌浆的时候，突然遇到冰雹灾害，受灾面积占夏季作物总面积的88.5％。在这种紧要关头，县委第一书记王治国同志和公社党委第一书记张程同志赶到，并召开了各种会议，鼓舞全队干部和社员树起战胜灾害的雄心大志。但究竟需要采取哪些具体措施，干部和群众认识不统一。有的说：“农业丢了副业找”；也有的人说：“副业门路不多，油水不大，还是国家救济吧！”针对这些情况，公社党委便领导大家进行辩论。通过辩论，使所有干部和社员认识到，只有坚决贯彻党的“以粮为纲、多种经营、全面发展”的方针，才是发展生产的正确道路。在这个基础上，大队党支部提出了“夏季丢了秋季找，粮食丢了还在粮食里找”的行动口号，全面展开了抗灾夺丰收的群众运动。在运动开始之前，公社无偿地拨给了他们一万元，运来七万斤化肥和四万多斤种子、饲料、菜子等。公社拖拉机站开来两台拖拉机，其他兄弟大队也积极支援，结果全队不仅将受灾的近三千亩地种上了糜、谷，同时又扩种了一千多亩地。抢种、补种结束以后，全大队又发动社员找出了十八项多种经营门路，除留够田间管理人员外，全队又抽出一百多人大搞木业、铁业、畜牧、打鱼、编织、养鸡、鸭、兔、运输等副业，三个月共收入四万多元。大队将搞副业挣来的钱，除改善社员生活外，购买了七万斤尿素化肥、十五部铁辕犁和各种车辆，当年用在生产上，收到了显著效果。经过半年的奋战，粮食作物和多种经营获得了双丰收，农业总收入超过了1958年。这一事实，充分教育了所有干部和广大社员：坚决贯彻执行党的方针政策，是一切工作永远胜利的可靠保证。这个大队的党支部书记杨生选说：党的政策一旦被群众掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。
    干部从这一事情中受到启发，进一步加强了群众的政策教育，使党的政策家喻户晓、人人皆知。这个大队党支部采取的具体办法是：（一）会上传达和登门解释相结合。每一项政策下来后，大队党支部首先召开干部、党团员和积极分子会议进行传达；他们领会了政策精神以后，就分片包干、分头向群众宣传。这样，党的政策就能迅速为群众所掌握。（二）抓老弱社员和落后社员，消灭政策宣传上的空白点。开社员大会，有些老弱社员因为身体的关系，往往不能参加。但他们有着丰富的生产经验，假若对党的政策缺乏了解，就不能发挥应有的作用。对思想落后的社员，更需要加强思想教育，向他们宣传党的各项方针政策，从而提高他们的思想觉悟。因此，对于这两种人，党支部采取了政策上门的办法，收到了良好效果。（三）读报、政策上墙和政策下地三结合。这是使社员经常熟悉政策的一个有效办法。各个生产队一般都坚持了田头读报、食堂读报，学习党的政策和各项生产经验；同时每项政策传达后，他们都写成标语贴到各个食堂，写到黑板上带到田头，反复地向社员宣传，做到政策深入人心。（四）组织宣传队伍，向群众宣传各个时期的方针政策。党的每项政策下达时，党支部都向全队的教师学生进行传达，然后由他们组成宣传队伍，广泛地向群众宣传。今年以来，关于多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针和大办农业、大办粮食的宣传，都采取了这种办法。（五）印发宣传材料。大队党支部考虑到基层干部文化水平一般较低，单凭开会传达，还不能收到应有效果。为了弥补这一缺点，他们经常根据党的政策精神，编印成通俗易懂的材料，分发给小队干部。小队干部说：“有了这个材料，就克服了‘开会担一担，回来剩一半’的缺点。”
    在贯彻党的各项政策中，西湖大队党支部发扬了实事求是的精神，既坚持党的政策原则，又结合具体情况。为了作到这一点，他们时时走群众路线，遇事和社员商量。在同群众商量中，他们正确地贯彻了阶级路线，除了依靠党团员外，还紧紧依靠贫农、下中农。在增产措施中，他们特别注意向老农学习，事事请教老农。在制订生产计划时，大队党支部首先根据公社的具体要求，结合本队实际情况进行反复研究后，提出初步意见，交给群众讨论，然后根据群众的意见进行修改，再拿到群众中讨论。这种“三上三下”的工作方法，使得生产指标建立在积极可靠的基础上。例如在制订今年生产计划时，支部开始提出小麦平均单产四百二十斤的指标，然后各个支委便分头到作业组召开老农和社员会进行讨论。老农根据过去经验，认为西湖土质瘠薄、盐碱性大，要求大面积增产的幅度过大，就有落空的危险。各个生产小队也逐块分析本队的土质条件，依据实际情况，分别制订了不同的生产指标。仅以小麦来说，一小队的生产指标亩产是三百六十斤，二小队三百七十斤，五小队三百四十斤。各小队的生产指标制订后，全大队又采取了干部、老农和社员三结合的办法，进行了一次复查，而后大队党支部又根据新计划进行平衡，最后将计划落实，分别向小队实行“三包”。这样制订的生产指标，积极又可靠，社员们感到只要增产措施跟上，超产大有可为。因此，各承包单位普遍出现了增产措施加码，力争超包产的生产新高潮。今年小麦收割后，如何进一步贯彻党的“多种多收与高产多收”两条腿走路的方针，是个很重要的问题。大队党支部副书记王功，到八十多岁的王子山家和他商量。王子山根据自己六十多年积累下来的“立夏不下雨，秋雨必定多”的经验，提出大量种小糜子，产量一定会超过大糜子。党支部接受了这一意见，原计划全队复种五百多亩，实际种了六百多亩。结果小糜子单产高出大糜子的产量。
