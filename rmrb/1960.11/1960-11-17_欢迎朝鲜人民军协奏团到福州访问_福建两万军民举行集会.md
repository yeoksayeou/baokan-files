Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 16th: Over 20,000 people from all walks of life in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City, along with commanders and fighters from the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Fujian Front, solemnly held a rally yesterday afternoon to warmly welcome the Korean People's Army Ensemble's visit and performance in Fuzhou.

Among those attending the meeting were General Han Xianchu, Lieutenant General Liu Peishan and other leaders of the Fujian Front troops, Jia 久min, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Chen Shaokuan, Xu Ya, and He Minxue, Vice Governors of Fujian Province, Zhang Chuandong, First Secretary of the CPC Fuzhou Municipal Committee, Zhang Jizhong, Mayor of Fuzhou, and Major General Wei Chuantong, representative of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, who accompanied the distinguished guests on their visits.

General Han Xianchu spoke at the meeting. He said that China and North Korea are brotherly countries as close as lips and teeth. The people of the two countries have forged an unbreakable fighting friendship with blood in the common struggle against imperialism, especially against U.S. imperialism. He said that the Chinese people resolutely support the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The beautiful three thousand li of Korean land will eventually be unified. Our people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Matsu, the indivisible territory of the motherland, and Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Matsu must also return to the embrace of the motherland.

Major General Zhang Ruihuan, head of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, spoke at the meeting. He said that the fighting friendship forged with blood between the people and armies of North Korea and China in the long-term common struggle is unbreakable. This close friendly relationship between the people and their armies of the two countries has demonstrated invincible strength in defeating the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea. He said that today, the people of North Korea and China are still waging a resolute struggle against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism.

Major General Zhang Ruihuan said that U.S. imperialism still occupies the southern half of our country and is plotting to turn it into a base for atomic warfare; U.S. imperialism also forcibly occupies Taiwan, the indivisible territory of the Chinese people. However, U.S. imperialism must get out of the southern half of our country and China's Taiwan. He said that the friendship between the people and armies of North Korea and China will always advance together in the common struggle against imperialism and in the cause of building socialism and communism.

At the meeting, Major General Zhang Ruihuan, on behalf of the Korean People's Army, presented a banner to the PLA Fujian Front troops. Lieutenant General Liu Peishan and others, on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the PLA Fujian Front, presented a flag to the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and gifts to the Korean People's Army Ensemble.

The Korean People's Army Ensemble arrived in Fuzhou on the morning of the 14th by special train from Xiamen.

    据新华社福州16日电　福建省、福州市各界人民和中国人民解放军福建前线陆、海、空军部队指战员二万多人，昨天下午隆重举行集会，热烈欢迎朝鲜人民军协奏团到福州访问演出。
