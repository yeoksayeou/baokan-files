Shen Yanbing, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, expressed warm farewell and heartfelt sentiments to the guests at the banquet.

In the future, our Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will spare no effort to devote all our efforts to this end.

Head of the delegation Stoletov said at the banquet that the great Lenin pointed out the great significance of the Sino-Soviet alliance, and Lenin's doctrine is our guide forward.
