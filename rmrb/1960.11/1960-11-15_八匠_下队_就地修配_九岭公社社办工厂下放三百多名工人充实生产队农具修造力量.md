    "Eight Craftsmen" Go Down to the Teams: On-the-Spot Repair and Assembly
    Jiuling Commune's Commune-Run Factory Transfers Over 300 Workers to Strengthen Production Teams' Agricultural Implement Repair and Manufacturing Capacity
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Hubei Daily, Jiuling Commune in Chongyang County extracted a portion of its "eight craftsmen" from commune-run factories, including blacksmiths, carpenters, bamboo craftsmen, stonemasons, coppersmiths, mud workers, brick and tile makers, and tailors, totaling 328 people, and sent them down to the production teams. Together with the original blacksmiths, carpenters, and other craftsmen of the production teams, they established 56 repair stations and repair groups.
    The Jiuling Commune's adoption of this approach has made it more convenient for production teams to repair and assemble small agricultural implements in a timely manner, and it has also facilitated the lives of commune members. According to statistics from Jiuling First Team of Shuangma Management Area, within half a month from the establishment of the repair station on October 16th to the end of October, the workers, in the spirit of using local materials and on-the-spot repair and assembly, promptly repaired and manufactured 1,284 small agricultural implements, ensuring that the autumn harvest and autumn planting work seized the season. The blacksmiths and carpenters of the Second Production Team of Gaofeng Management Area went to the fields with the commune members during the autumn planting, discovered that the parts of the row planters were not firmly installed, and that the seeds were easily crushed and blocked, and promptly repaired them, ensuring the smooth promotion of the new agricultural implements. This enabled the entire team to use row planters in all fields where they could be used, improving work efficiency. The workers also adopted a method of part-time work and part-time farming, directly participating in agricultural production and adding labor to agriculture. After the blacksmiths Jiang Shaoqing and Jiang Chenggu and the bamboo craftsman Wu Faxiang arrived at the production team, each of them also took an apprentice, teaching them their skills.
    The establishment of production team repair stations and repair groups has also brought many conveniences to the lives of commune members. After the "eight craftsmen" were sent down, Wu Jinfu, the Party branch secretary of the Eighth Small Team of Jiuling First Team, immediately sent someone to help him repair it when the house of commune member Xu Zhonggui was damaged.

    “八匠”下队　就地修配
    九岭公社社办工厂下放三百多名工人充实生产队农具修造力量
    本报讯　据湖北日报消息：崇阳县九岭公社从社办工厂中抽出一部分铁、木、篾、石、铜、泥水、砖瓦、缝纫等“八匠”，共三百二十八人，下放到生产队，同生产队原有的铁、木等工匠一起，建立了五十六个修配站和修理小组。
    九岭公社采取这种做法，更方便了生产队及时修配小农具，也方便了社员生活。据双马管理区九岭一队统计，从10月16日建立修配站到10月底的半个月内，工人们本着就地取材、就地修配的精神，及时修理和制造了一千二百八十四件小农具，保证秋收秋种工作抢住了季节。高峰管理区第二生产队铁、木工人，在秋种中跟社员们一起下田，发现了条播器部件安装得不牢实，以及下籽容易碾烂、阻塞等毛病，及时加以修理，保证了新农具的顺利推广，使全队能够使用条播器的田地全部采用条播器播种，提高了工效。工人们还采取亦工亦农的方式，直接参加农业生产，为农业增添了劳动力。铁工姜少青、姜成古和篾工吴发祥到生产队以后，每个人还带了一个徒工，向他们传授技艺。
    生产队修配站和修理小组的建立，给社员生活也带来了很多方便。九岭一队八小队社员徐中贵的住房破了，“八匠”下放以后，队的党支部书记吴金富就马上派人帮他修补好了。
