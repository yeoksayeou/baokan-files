Cuban Health Work in Development

Before the victory of the revolution, the Cuban people suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of U.S. imperialism and the Batista dictatorship, and health conditions were extremely poor. Out of the nation's 6.5 million people, 3.5 million lived in dilapidated shacks and slums. 100,000 people suffered from tuberculosis, 95% of children in rural areas had intestinal parasites, and infant mortality rates were high. There was a severe shortage of hospitals and doctors.

In order to improve the people's health, the Cuban revolutionary government has vigorously carried out health and healthcare work. The recent national health work photo exhibition held in Havana showed that Cuba's health undertakings have made tremendous achievements in the year or so since the victory of the revolution.

Doctors and Hospitals Serving Farmers

Before the victory of the revolution, there were very few doctors in Cuba, and there were no doctors at all in the vast rural areas. Now the number of doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel in the country has more than doubled, and the number of hospital beds has increased by 49%. In order to protect the health of farmers, many small hospitals and medical teams have been established in rural areas across the country. Taking the mountainous area of ​​Oriente Province as an example, eighteen small hospitals have been built, each with six doctors and thirty beds, and nine medical teams have also been established. There are now 353 doctors in rural areas across the country. They not only treat farmers, but also help with garbage disposal, well digging, toilet construction, and health education and sports activities to enhance the people's physical fitness.

Vigorously Prevent and Control Parasitic Diseases

Intestinal parasitic diseases are very prevalent in rural Cuba. 63% of people in Havana Province suffer from this disease, and as high as 89% in Pinar del Río Province, with even more children aged five to nine affected. In order to completely eliminate this disease that seriously endangers people's health, the Cuban government has organized 125 medical teams to provide free treatment to patients in various places, and has taken various measures to improve rural environmental sanitation. The exhibition's explanation pointed out that intestinal parasitic diseases not only rely on drug treatment, but also require improving people's living standards, improving environmental sanitation, and enhancing people's physical fitness, so that the people across the country can prevent and completely eradicate the disease.

Eradicating Yellow Fever

Before the victory of the revolution, 184 of the 300 towns with more than 1,000 residents in Cuba did not have running water, and 293 towns did not have drainage ditches, so yellow fever was prevalent. The Cuban government has formulated a four-year plan to eradicate yellow fever, preparing to lay water pipes and drainage ditches in towns and eliminate the vectors that transmit yellow fever.

In order to guarantee the people's health, the Cuban government has also established national pharmaceutical factories, opened health schools to train medical personnel, and reduced the prices of more than 100 kinds of medicines.

    古巴卫生工作在发展中
    在革命胜利前，古巴人民遭受美帝国主义和巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的残酷压迫和剥削，卫生条件十分恶劣。在全国六百五十万人口中，有三百五十万人住在破烂的茅屋和贫民窟里。有十万人害肺病，农村里有95％的儿童患肠寄生虫病，婴儿死亡率很高。医院和医生非常缺乏。
    古巴革命政府为了改善人民健康情况，大力开展了卫生和保健工作。最近在哈瓦那举行的全国卫生工作图片展览会显示，古巴的卫生事业在革命胜利后的一年多内已经取得了巨大的成就。
    为农民服务的医生和医院
    革命胜利前，古巴全国的医生寥寥无几，广大农村里根本没有医生。现在全国医生、护士等医务工作人员已较前增加了一倍多，医院的病床增加了49％。为了保障农民健康，已在全国农村建立许多小型医院和医疗队。以奥连特省山区为例，已建成十八所小型医院，各拥有六名医生和三十张病床，另外还建立了九个医疗队。全国农村的医生已达三百五十三名。他们不仅给农民治病，而且还帮助处理垃圾、打井、建立厕所，并进行卫生宣传和开展体育活动，以增强人民的体质。
    大力防治寄生虫病
    在古巴农村，肠寄生虫病十分流行。哈瓦那省有63％的人患这种病，而皮那尔德里奥省竟高达89％，五岁至九岁儿童病患者更多，为了彻底消灭这种严重危害人民健康的疾病，古巴政府已组织一百二十五个医疗队，到各地给患者免费治疗，并采取各种措施改进农村环境卫生。展览会的说明指出，肠寄生虫病不仅依靠药物治疗，还要提高人民生活水平，改善环境卫生，增强人民体质，使全国人民能预防和彻底根除病患。
    消灭黄热病
    革命胜利前，古巴全国一千居民以上的三百个市镇里，一百八十四个市镇没有自来水，二百九十三个市镇没有排水沟，因此，黄热病流行。古巴政府已拟订一项消灭黄热病的四年计划，准备在市镇普遍敷设自来水管和排水沟，消灭传播黄热病的媒介。
    为了保证人民健康，古巴政府还建立了国家的制药厂，开办卫生学校，训练医务人员，并降低了一百多种药品的价格。
