Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, November 17th: Lüda city has fixed a group of factories, workshops, and production teams to produce daily-use small commodities in a planned way, which has greatly increased the output and variety of small commodities and improved their quality. At the same time, it has also created conditions for the planned production of small commodities according to market needs. So far, the city has designated 159 units to specialize in the production of small commodities. The main varieties produced reach 678 kinds, and the output is generally more than doubled compared with the past. Moreover, the varieties are numerous, the styles are novel, and the quality is solid, which are very popular among customers and consumers. Among them, there are 67 kinds of high-quality products and famous brands that sell well at home and abroad.

In order to fully rely on the industrial production of urban people's communes to produce small commodities, among the 159 specialized production units, commune-run industries account for 117, and the varieties produced account for more than 70 percent of the total specialized production varieties. For some small commodities that require higher technology, have a large output, and require specialized equipment, state-owned industries also adopt the method of cultivating "successors" to actively help commune-run industries improve their technical level and provide specialized equipment, and gradually decentralize the production of these products to commune-run industries. After the specialized production units are fixed, the competent departments, supply and marketing departments, and specialized factories are organized to jointly study and formulate the production plans of each factory according to the principles of combining top-down, combining production and sales, and combining current production and future production development, in line with market needs and the production conditions of specialized factories. In accordance with the spirit of both fixing and not fixing rigidly, the production varieties, output, production development direction, as well as the supply and marketing relationship and raw material supply relationship of each specialized production unit are fixed, so as to ensure that the production of small commodities maintains relative stability in terms of variety, equipment, material supply and product sales, in order to promote the high-speed development of small commodity production; but the variety of colors is not excessively restricted, in order to give full play to the flexible characteristics of small commodity production.

The practice of this city in implementing fixed-point specialized production of small commodities proves the benefits of this approach: First, it guarantees that the production of small commodities will not be squeezed out under any circumstances, and the output of various products can also maintain an appropriate proportion. Second, each specialized production unit has created conditions for technical transformation due to fixed products. The trouser hooks, hairpins and other products produced by the Xigang District Daily-use Metal Products Factory originally relied entirely on manual operation, which occupied a lot of labor and the quality was not high. After the technical transformation, mechanized production was realized, and the efficiency was increased by six to seven times compared with the past. Third, with the specialization of production, the technical operations of workers in many specialized production units have become increasingly skilled, and the quality of products has been greatly improved. Not only have the original famous brand products been restored, but also new varieties have been gradually expanded. Fourth, after fixed-point specialized production, special materials are used for special purposes, which promotes the enthusiasm of various production units in opening up raw material sources and ensures normal production; at the same time, it also promotes various specialized factories to try every means to save raw materials and realize more production with less material. Fifth, it further strengthens the relationship between production and sales and strengthens the planning of production and supply and marketing. Sixth, through fixed-point specialization, the competent departments have mastered the production capacity and supply and marketing situation of small commodities in the city, which is convenient for leadership and management, and also facilitates the formulation of plans.

    旅大固定一批工厂专门生产小商品。
    据新华社旅大十七日电  旅大市固定一批工厂、车间和生产小组有计划地生产日用小商品，促使小商品的产量、品种大幅度增长，质量提高；同时，也为小商品根据市场需要实行计划生产创造了条件。到目前为止，全市指定了一百五十九个单位专门生产小商品，生产的主要品种达六百七十八种，产量一般都比过去增长一倍以上，而且品种繁多，花样新颖，质地坚固，很受订户和消费者欢迎。其中畅销国内外的优良产品和名牌货就有六十七种。
    为了充分依靠城市人民公社工业生产小商品，在固定的一百五十九个专业生产单位中，社办工业就占了一百一十七个，生产品种占整个专业生产品种的百分之七十以上。对于一些技术要求较高、产量大、需要专业设备的小商品，国营工业也采取培养“接班人”的办法，积极帮助社办工业提高技术水平，提供专门设备，逐步把这些产品下放给社办工业生产。在专业生产单位固定以后，根据上下结合、产销结合、当前生产和今后生产发展结合的原则，组织主管部门、供销部门和专业厂共同研究，按照市场的需要和专业厂的生产条件，制定了各个厂的生产规划。根据既要定住、又不定死的精神，固定了各个专业生产单位的生产品种、产量、生产发展方向，以及供销关系和原料材料供应关系，保证小商品生产在品种、设备、材料供应和产品销售等方面都保持相对的稳定性，以便促进小商品生产的高速度发展；但对品种花色又不过多限制，以便充分发挥小商品生产上机动灵活的特点。
    这个市实行定点专业生产小商品的实践证明，这种做法的好处：首先，保证了小商品生产在任何情况下不会被挤掉，各种产品的产量也能保持适当的比例。其次，各个专业生产单位，由于固定产品，为技术改造创造了条件。西岗区日用金属制品厂生产的裤钩、发卡等产品，原来全靠手工操作，占用劳力多，质量又不高，技术改造以后，实现了机械化生产，效率比过去提高六倍到七倍。第三，很多专业生产单位，随着生产专业化，工人的技术操作日渐熟练，产品质量大有改进，不仅恢复了原有的名牌产品，而且逐步扩大新品种。第四，定点专业生产以后，专料专用，促进了各生产单位开辟原材料来源的积极性，保证了正常生产；同时还促使各个专业厂千方百计节约原材料，实现了多增产、少增料。第五，进一步密切了产、销之间的关系，加强了生产、供销的计划性。第六，通过定点专业，主管部门掌握了全市小商品的生产能力和供销情况，便于领导和管理，也便于制定规划。
