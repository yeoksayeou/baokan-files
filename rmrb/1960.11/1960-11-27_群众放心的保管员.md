	A Storekeeper the Masses Can Trust
	Hebei Ribao reporter, Baoding Ribao reporter
	Zhang Zhong (Communist Party member), the grain and finance storekeeper of Luohe Production Team, Zhangshi People's Commune, Xushui County, Hebei Province, has been managing grain and money in the village since 1939, going through the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation... and still doing the same old job.

	For twenty-two years, Zhang Zhong has managed grain and money without recording a single account that doesn't comply with regulations, without handling a single matter that deviates from policy, without wasting grain, without wasting money, and certainly without engaging in embezzlement or bribery. The masses trust him, the leadership trusts him, and everyone who has dealt with him or had contact with him trusts him.
		
		Meticulous

	Currently, Zhang Zhong manages four warehouses: rations, feed, seeds, and reserves. These warehouses are all very sturdy, and the keys to the warehouses have never left his person. The warehouse doors always have seals written by Zhang Zhong himself, and each time a door is opened, the seal is replaced. The warehouses are kept spotlessly clean. No matter how busy he is, he insists on the system of checking grain temperature every ten days and fumigating with chemicals every half month. Grain entering and leaving the warehouse has triplicate forms, with the brigade, the team, and himself each holding a copy. Every transaction is "three-way matched," and no one can be even a little bit careless. When allocating rations to the canteen or feed to the team for livestock, no one can expect to overdraw or pre-claim.

	Zhang Zhong is very strict with financial expenditures. No matter who it is, as long as it doesn't comply with regulations, they can forget about getting money from him. In February of this year, brigade cadre Zhang Fengzhu felt that he frequently had to go to the county and commune for meetings and wanted to buy a bicycle. After discussing it with a few cadres, he decided to buy one and asked Zhang Zhong to pay for it. Zhang Zhong said that this was a non-production expenditure and could not be paid without the approval of the commune. Zhang Fengzhu knew that it didn't comply with the regulations, but he felt that he had discussed it with several cadres and that buying the bicycle was for official business, so he insisted that Zhang Zhong pay for it... Soon, the commune Party committee learned about this matter, actively supported Zhang Zhong, and severely criticized Zhang Fengzhu. The commune Party committee also commended Zhang Zhong at a meeting of all commune cadres, calling on people to learn from his spirit of diligence, thrift, and responsibility in running the commune.

	Zhang Zhong insists on financial regulations, being strict with others and even stricter with himself. He said, "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked. If those who manage grain and money do not behave properly, don't expect others to abide by the rules." Every time the team distributes things, he lets everyone take what they like first, and he takes what's left for himself. Once, when the team was distributing vegetables, there wasn't much left when it was his turn. He said, "Just give me this little bit, and make it up to me later if there's more." The commune members knew that he never actually made up for it, and they felt a little bad about always letting him do that. Some people wanted to give him a portion of their own, but Zhang Zhong repeatedly declined. In the end, everyone voluntarily took a little less and gave him a share.

		Democratic Management

	After the establishment of the People's Commune, public canteens were established, and the people's rations were changed from being managed by individual households to being managed by the production team. Zhang Zhong felt that although he had many years of experience in managing grain, how to manage the affairs of the entire team was a new topic. He summarized his past work experience as: listening to the Party, acting according to policies, and consulting with the masses in case of problems. He thought that if he wanted to do a good job in the future, he had to listen to the Party even more, act according to policies even more, and rely on the masses even more.

	Luohe Production Team established a life management committee, and Zhang Zhong participated in the committee as a representative in charge of grain management. He reports on grain management to the life committee, which has become a system. He conscientiously implements the matters resolved at the meetings. He also uses every opportunity to let every commune member know as much as possible about the grain management situation. In addition to regularly posting public announcements, he often tells everyone during commune member gatherings or when chatting with commune members: how much grain has been harvested, how much grain has been consumed, and how much of what kind of grain is still available, so that commune members know clearly.

	How can the grain of the entire team be considered well-managed? Under the leadership of the Party branch, Zhang Zhong correctly handled the interests of the state, the collective, and the commune members. He conscientiously studied the distribution policy, believing that in order to make the grain distribution fully comply with policy requirements, it is necessary to verify the yield and insist on weighing it into the warehouse. In this way, the amount to be handed over to the state, the amount to be returned to the production team, and the amount to be given to the small team and commune members can all be implemented. During the autumn harvest distribution, Zhang Zhong did his work in the fields and on the threshing grounds, making the yield verified accurately and determined early, which not only made the various distributions of the entire team realized early but also provided a basis for evaluating the yield for the entire commune. One day, Zhang Zhong came to the sweet potato cellar of the second small team and found that this small team was using bushel baskets to measure the potatoes into the cellar. He asked the work-point recorder Liu Lianzhu, "Is this accurate?"

	Liu Lianzhu said, "About the same."

	"About the same? That won't do. A difference of three or five catties per basket isn't obvious, but think about how much this cellar will be short! If the whole team does this, how much will it be short! If the yield isn't verified accurately, the income can't be calculated accurately, and it's not good for the state, the team, or the commune members." Zhang Zhong's words were clear and the reasoning was clear, and everyone admired him from the bottom of their hearts.

	With Zhang Zhong's help, the cadres of the second small team felt that the grain should be carefully weighed into the warehouse, and the "about the same" method was never used again.

		Expanding the Scope

	Zhang Zhong's management of grain is not limited to "managing it well." He also does a lot of work on eating it well and using it well. Because he knows that eating and using grain well is directly related to managing it well. He often goes deep into the canteen and kitchen, understands the grain consumption and the production and operation of the household, reports to the Party branch, and puts forward his own opinions. Under the leadership of the Party branch, he actively improves the canteen work and effectively promotes planned grain consumption and economical grain consumption.

	On June 28th of this year, the canteen changed two new administrators, one was Zhang Tieliang, and the other was Zhang Zhong's daughter Zhang Bianxia. The two young people were energetic and motivated, but they were a little reckless and didn't know the basics. In the first five days, the canteen lost two hundred catties of grain. The two were anxious. What to do? "Bianxia, talk to your dad, and ask him to make it up for us, even if it's a loan!" Tieliang came up with an idea. Bianxia, with no other choice, had to bite the bullet and go to Zhang Zhong and say:

	"Dad, can you think of a way? We lost two hundred catties of rations in five days."

	"Think of a way for what?"

	"Make it up, even if it's a loan."

	"You say it so lightly."

	"Then what should we do?..."

	"Who told you to make it like this?"

	The matter was about to reach a stalemate, and Bianxia's eyes were filled with tears. Finally, Zhang Zhong said, "Bring Tieliang here, let's think of a way."

	Zhang Zhong helped them find the reason for the grain loss and used this fact to teach them a lesson. At the same time, he encouraged them not to be discouraged and that things would definitely be done well.

	What else did Zhang Zhong do in the canteen?

	Once he found that although rations were issued to the canteen according to the number of people and the quota every five days, the canteen did not strictly adhere to weighing the rice before cooking and cooking according to the number of people. In order to solve this problem, on the one hand, under the unified leadership of the branch, they carried out education on planned grain consumption and economical grain consumption, and on the other hand, they helped the canteen improve its management methods. In order to promote mass grain saving, Zhang Zhong also helped the canteen strictly implement the policy of "eating with tickets, and returning savings to oneself," and adopted the "spot check" method. The grain saved by each person can be taken back, but it must be cleared every ten days at most. In this way, planned grain consumption has become a conscious action of the masses.

	How to regulate the lives of commune members is something Zhang Zhong often cares about. He believes that regulating life well will make commune members more motivated, which will lead to more grain production, and the storekeeper will be able to store grain. In addition to the grain distributed to the canteen, Zhang Zhong also plans to store some minor grains in the warehouse, keeping them for commune members to make cakes during festivals.

	Zhang Zhong is very good at accepting the correct opinions of the masses. One day, an elderly commune member said to him, "It's cold, shouldn't we eat a few meals of mixed-grain soup with the mung beans we harvested?" Zhang Zhong thought his opinion was very correct, and he mixed mung beans in when he distributed grain to the canteen.

    群众放心的保管员
    河北日报记者　保定日报记者
    河北省徐水县张市公社罗河生产队的粮食、财务保管员张忠（共产党员），从1939年就在村里管粮管钱，经过了抗日战争、解放战争……一直到现在，还是干着老差事。
    张忠管粮管钱二十二年，没有记下一笔不合手续的账，没有办一件离开政策的事，没有糟蹋过粮食，没有浪费过钱财，更没有营私舞弊的事。对于他，群众放心，领导上放心，凡是跟他打过交道、有过来往的人都放心。
          一丝不苟
    现在，张忠管着口粮、饲料、籽种、储备等四个仓库。这些仓库都修整得很牢，仓库的钥匙没有离过他的身。仓库的门上总是贴着张忠亲手写的封条，每开一次门，就换一次。库房里拾掇得干干净净。不管多忙，他都坚持十天检查一次粮食温度、半月用药剂熏一次的制度。粮食入库出库都有三联单，大队、小队和他自己各持一联，每一笔都是“三头对案”，谁也不能马虎一点。向食堂拨口粮，向小队拨牲口饲料，甭想多支、预领。
    张忠对财务开支很严，不论是谁，只要不合手续，就不用想从他手里支出钱去。今年2月间，大队干部张凤柱感觉到经常要到县和公社开会，很想买一辆自行车，他和少数干部商量后，就做主买了，让张忠付款。张忠说这是一笔非生产性的用款，不经过公社批准，不能开支。张凤柱自知是不合规定，可是又觉得和几个干部商量了，买车子也是为了公事，仍坚持让张忠开支……。很快，公社党委知道了这件事，积极支持张忠，严厉批评了张凤柱。公社党委还在全社干部会上表扬了张忠，号召人们学习他勤俭办社、认真负责的精神。
    张忠坚持财务制度，对人严、对己更严。他说：“上梁不正下梁歪，管粮管钱的人行为不端，休想叫别人遵守制度。”队里每次分东西，他把人们喜欢的先让大家分走，剩下的他自己要。有一次，队里分菜，到最后轮到他的时候，剩的不多了，他说：“就要这点算了，以后有了再补。”社员们知道他从来是说补不补，觉得老让他这样有些过意不去。有的人就想把自己的一份给他，张忠却一再推辞。最后，大家都自动少分了点，匀给了他一份。
          民主管理
    人民公社成立后，建立起公共食堂，群众的口粮由过去的一家一户管理，改为由生产队管理。张忠觉得，虽然有了多年的管粮经验，但是怎样才能管好全队之家，这是个新题目。他总结了过去工作的经验是：听党的话，按政策办事，遇事与群众商量。他想，今后的工作要想做好，就得更听党的话，更得按政策办事，更要依靠群众。
    罗河生产队建立了生活管理委员会，张忠作为管理粮食方面的代表参加了委员会。他向生活委员会报告粮食管理工作，已经形成制度。会议上决议的事项，他都认真执行。他还利用一切场合，把粮食管理情况，尽量让每一个社员都知道。除了坚持定期张榜公布以外，在社员集会的时候，或是同社员们闲扯的时候，他常常告诉给大家：收了多少粮，吃了多少粮，什么样的粮食还有多少，使社员们了解得清清楚楚。
    对于全队的粮食，怎样才算管得好呢？张忠在党支部领导下，正确地处理了国家、集体和社员三方面的利益。他认真学习了分配政策，认为要使粮食分配完全符合政策要求，就必须核实产量，坚持过秤入库。这样，才能使该交国家的，该归生产队的，该给小队和社员的，都落实兑现。秋收分配中，张忠把工作做到地里、场里，使产量核得实，定得早，不但使全队各项分配及早的落了实，也为全公社提供了评定产量的依据。一天，张忠来到了第二小队的甘薯窖前，发现这个小队用筐头量着入窖，他问记工员刘连珠：“这样能准确吗？”
    刘连珠说：“差不多。”
    “差不多？这样说可不行，一筐差三、五斤不显眼，你想这一窖要差多少呀！全队都这样办，要差多少呀！这样产量核不实，收入算不准，亏了国家、亏了队、亏了社员都不好。”张忠的话说得透，理摆得清，人人从心里佩服。
    第二小队的干部在张忠的帮助下，都觉得粮食入库应该认真过秤，“差不多”的办法从此再也不用了。
          打开圈子
    张忠管理粮食，并不是把工作限制在“管好”这个圈子里，他还在吃好、用好上做了很多的工作。因为他知道，粮食的吃好和用好，直接关系着管好。他经常深入食堂，下厨房，了解用粮和家底生产经营情况，向党支部汇报，并提出自己的意见。在党支部的领导下，积极改进食堂工作，切实推行计划用粮和节约用粮。
    今年6月28日，食堂换了两个新管理员，一个是张铁梁，一个是张忠的女儿张便霞。两个青年人有朝气，干劲足，可就是有点冒失，底码不清。头五天，食堂里就吃亏了二百斤粮食。两人着了急，怎么办？“便霞，找你爹说说，给咱补上吧，就是借给也行！”铁梁想出了点子。便霞出于无计可施，只得硬着头皮去找张忠，说：
    “爹，你给想个办法吧，五天的口粮亏了二百斤。”
    “想什么办法？”
    “补上吧，借给也行。”
    “你说得倒轻快。”
    “那怎么办？……”
    “谁让你们搞成这样子呢？”
    事情眼看僵了局，便霞眼里噙着泪花。最后，还是张忠说：“把铁梁找来，咱们想想办法。”
    张忠帮助他俩找到了亏粮的原因，并用这个事实教导了他们一番，同时也鼓励他们不要泄气，事情一定能够办好。
    张忠在食堂里还做了些什么工作呢？
    有一次他发现，口粮虽然按人数、指标，五天一次发到食堂，可是食堂并没有严格坚持秤米下锅，按人做饭。为了解决这个问题，一面在支部统一领导下展开计划用粮节约用粮的教育，一面帮助食堂改进了管理办法。为了推行群众性的节约用粮，张忠还帮助食堂严格执行了“凭票吃饭，节约归己”的政策，采用了“现碰现”的办法，各人节约的粮食，可以领粮回去，最多不超过十天就清理一次。这样，计划用粮就形成了群众性的自觉行动。
    如何调剂好社员生活，是张忠经常关心的事。他认为调剂好生活，社员干劲大，就能更多的增产粮食，保管员也才能有粮食保管。张忠除了搭配着发给食堂的粮食以外，在仓库里，还有计划地存些小杂粮，留着过节给社员们做糕吃。
    张忠很善于接受群众的正确意见。一天，一位上了年纪的社员对他说：“天冷了，咱们打下的绿豆，不该吃几顿杂面汤吗？”张忠认为他的意见很对，给食堂发粮食时，就搭配了绿豆。
