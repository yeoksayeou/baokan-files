Going Deep to Learn From the Masses, Leading the Masses Forward:
Downward-Transferred Cadre Wan Xianqun Learned Good Leadership Methods

(Our Newspaper Reporter Song Peiji reports) Wan Xianqun, a cadre transferred downward from Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved remarkable results in his work during the two months he has been at the grassroots level. His experience fully demonstrates that downward-transferred cadres, as long as they humbly learn from commune members and grassroots cadres, acting first as students and then as teachers, can more quickly improve themselves, learn practical work skills, and do a good job at the grassroots level.

Wan Xianqun was originally the Deputy Director of the Finance Bureau of Nanchang County. At the end of August this year, he was transferred downward to the Fangqiao Brigade of the Rengang Commune in the county to serve as the Party Branch Secretary. As soon as he arrived at the brigade, he encountered a severe drought affecting more than 30 mu of paddy fields. The brigade cadres proposed two different solutions: one was to draw water over the mountain to fight the drought, and the other was to dig a canal along the mountain to divert water for irrigation. Wan Xianqun was initially concerned that digging the canal would be a large project with many difficulties, and that the autumn harvest was approaching, so labor should not be too dispersed. He advocated adopting the former method, drawing water with a small number of people to save as many mu as possible. However, when he presented this suggestion to the masses for discussion, everyone advocated a concentrated effort to dig the canal. On the spot, more than 30 commune members signed up to form a shock brigade, taking the initiative to undertake the arduous task of digging the canal. As a result, the task was completed in just five days, not only without affecting the autumn harvest but also completely relieving the drought affecting more than 30 mu of safflower fields. Some fields were even intercropped with grain crops. This fact provided Wan Xianqun with a vivid lesson, making him clearly see the fiery revolutionary zeal and infinite power of the broad masses.

In September, the Commune Party Committee proposed launching a "Three Clearances" fertilizer accumulation campaign to clear field ridges and banks, requiring all production teams to complete it within six days. After this task was assigned, some small team cadres and commune members reflected that they could not complete it. At this time, Wan Xianqun took the initiative to consult with Deputy Brigade Leader Wan Luohan, who immediately took him to visit veteran commune member Wan Shaolian in the Fourth Team. After understanding the masses' thoughts, Wan Xianqun returned to the brigade and convened a forum of experienced farmers to solicit their opinions and summarize the benefits of early "Three Clearances" fertilizer accumulation with them. Wan Xianqun widely publicized these benefits to the commune members. As a result, the entire brigade completed the task in just five days. From then on, Wan Xianqun began to learn a set of working methods based on relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and following the mass line. In the past two months, he has made one or two close friends among the commune members in each small team, regularly visiting commune members and holding regular meetings with experienced farmers. Whenever he did something, he would first ask the "Three Olds" (i.e., old cadres, old farmers, and old commune members), so the difficulties encountered in the work were easily solved, and the work was done very well. Recently, when sowing green manure, to increase the yield of green manure, the brigade decided to change from broadcasting to fertilizer-mixed dibbling. At the beginning, some commune members were worried about not understanding the technology and fearing that it would take too much labor. However, after deeply visiting experienced farmers, he summarized the technology and benefits of dibbling safflower and used methods such as detailed accounting to inspire and mobilize the masses. This not only solved the technical difficulties of dibbling but also eliminated the ideological obstacles of some commune members, enabling all 380 mu of safflower in the entire team to be dibbled with fertilizer. The progress and quality of sowing were rated as the first in the entire commune.

Through extensive learning from commune members and grassroots cadres, Wan Xianqun also quickly learned many management experiences of the production team, thereby better leading the work of the production team. The Fangqiao Brigade originally had some shortcomings in the management of collective sideline production. For example, the settlement of income from sideline production outside the brigade was calculated by the commune members themselves, and all the excess was kept by themselves, causing the income of commune members engaged in sideline production outside the brigade to greatly exceed that of commune members engaged in production at home, affecting the production enthusiasm of commune members engaged in production at home. After Wan Xianqun discovered this problem, he immediately convened a forum of cadres, accountants, and some commune members. While asking them for advice and learning from them, he also conducted ideological education based on the Party's policies and then jointly researched and formulated a sideline production management system of "income belonging to the collective, fixed quota contracting, and bonus for exceeding the quota," which overcame the unreasonable phenomena in the management of sideline production in the entire team and promoted the development of sideline production.

In his daily work, Wan Xianqun also adopted the "three-pronged" approach of participating in production, learning production, and leading production simultaneously, and he took experienced farmers and grassroots cadres as teachers to learn production knowledge and improve his production skills. Wan Xianqun was originally an apprentice in a printing shop and did not know how to farm. After arriving at the production team, he followed the commune members in learning to plow and sow, working hard and practicing diligently. In just two months, he learned many production techniques such as plowing, sowing, weeding, and thinning seedlings. Because he had mastered certain production knowledge and skills, he became more proficient in leading and directing production. Once, when he went to the Second Team to inspect production, some commune members' land preparation was relatively rough, with fine topsoil raked, but the ground was filled with lumps of soil, which was not obvious on the surface. Because he was familiar with production, he went deep into the fields and discovered this problem, promptly making suggestions to the small team for reprocessing, thereby ensuring the quality of winter planting. After he discovered this problem, he immediately reminded all the small teams to pay attention, resulting in the high quality of this year's winter planting in the entire brigade. Now the commune members all praise Wan Xianqun as a "new farmer." (Attached picture)

    深入下去先向群众学习　走在前面带领群众前进
    下放干部万贤群学到好领导方法
    本报讯　记者宋培基报道：江西南昌县下放干部万贤群，下放到基层两个月，工作取得了出色的成绩。他的经验充分证明：下放到基层的干部，只要虚心向社员群众向基层干部学习，先当学生，后当先生，就能更快地锻炼提高自己，学到实际工作本领，做好基层工作。
    万贤群原是南昌县财政局副局长，今年8月底下放到该县荏港公社芳桥大队任党支部书记。他一到这个队，正好碰上队里有三十多亩田发生了严重旱象。队里的干部研究提出两个不同的办法，一是翻山车水抗旱，一是傍山开一条渠道引水灌溉。万贤群当时顾虑到挖渠道工程较大，困难较多，秋收即将开始，劳动力不能过于分散，主张采取前一种办法，抽少数人去车水抗旱，能救几亩就救几亩。可是，当他把这一意见交给群众讨论时，大家却主张突击开挖渠道。当场便有三十多个社员报名组织了一支突击队，主动地担负挖渠道的艰巨任务。结果经过五天突击，便完成了任务，不仅丝毫没影响秋收，而且使三十多亩受旱的红花草田全部解除了旱象，有的还套种上了粮食作物。这一事实，给万贤群上了生动的一课，使他清楚地看到了广大群众那种火热的革命干劲和无穷的力量。
    9月份，公社党委提出开展一次铲田塍田岸的“三光”积肥运动，要求各个生产队在六天内全部完成。这一任务下达后，有的小队干部和社员反映完不成，这时，万贤群便主动地找到副大队长万罗汗商量，万罗汗当即带着他到第四小队去访问老社员万绍连。摸清群众的思想后，万贤群回到队里就召开了老农座谈会，征求老农的意见，并同他们一起总结出早搞“三光”积肥的好处。万贤群将这些好处广泛向社员群众进行了宣传。结果，全大队只五天时间便完成了任务。从此以后，万贤群便开始学会了一套依靠群众、发动群众、走群众路线的工作方法。两个月来，他已在每个小队结交了一到二个社员知心朋友，经常坚持访问社员，并定期召开老农会，凡做一件事情都先请问“三老”（即老干部、老农、老社员），因而工作中碰到的困难迎刃而解，工作做得很出色。最近播种绿肥时，为了提高绿肥的产量，大队决定将撒播改为拌肥点播，开始时遇到部分社员怕不懂技术、怕花工多等思想障碍，但他经过深入地访问老农，总结出了点播红花草的技术和好处，并运用算细账等办法启发发动群众，既解决了点播的技术困难，又扫除了部分社员的思想障碍，使全队三百八十多亩红花草，全部实现了拌肥点播。播种的进度和质量都被评为全社第一名。
    通过广泛向社员群众、向基层干部学习，万贤群还很快学到了许多生产队的经营管理经验，从而更好地领导了生产队的工作。芳桥大队原来在集体副业生产管理方面存在某些缺点，如外出搞副业的收入结算都由社员个人去算，超额部分全部归己，致使外出搞副业的社员收入大大超过在家搞生产的社员，影响在家生产的社员的生产积极性。万贤群发现这一问题后，便立即召集了干部、会计和部分社员座谈，一边向他们请教学习，征求意见，一边根据党的方针政策进行思想教育，然后共同研究制订出一个
  “收入归集体，定额包干、超额提成奖励”的副业生产管理制度，使全队的副业生产管理克服了不合理的现象，促进了副业生产的发展。
    在日常的工作中，万贤群还采取“三边”的办法，一边参加生产，一边学习生产，一边领导生产，并拜老农和基层干部为师，学习生产知识，提高自己的生产技能。万贤群原来是个印刷店的学徒，不会种田，到了生产队后，社员犁田播种，他也跟着学犁田播种，勤学苦练，仅仅两个来月他便学会了犁田、播种、锄草、间苗等许多生产技术。由于掌握了一定的生产知识和技术，使他在领导和指挥生产上更加熟练了。有一次，他到二小队检查生产，有的社员整地比较粗糙，表土耙得细，地里头却包着土块，表面看不出来；由于他熟悉了生产，深入田间一看，就发现了这个问题，及时向小队提出意见，进行了加工，从而保证了冬种质量。他发现这一问题后，马上又提醒了各个小队注意，结果使全大队今年的冬种都做到了高质量。现在社员们都称赞万贤群是个“新农民”。（附图片）
