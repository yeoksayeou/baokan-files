Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 17th: Party and League organizations in Sichuan Province are enthusiastically providing comprehensive assistance to over one million young people who have newly joined the agricultural production frontline across the province, in terms of political ideology, production technology, and cultural knowledge, so that they can quickly play a role in production.

After over one million young people from all walks of life in Sichuan Province went to the agricultural frontline to participate in production, Party and League organizations in various places regarded strengthening their ideological education and helping them firmly establish the idea of taking pride in agriculture as an important task. Many places have adopted methods such as holding report meetings, forums, and running amateur League schools to enable young people to further understand the great significance of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. After studying, 217 young people who newly participated in agricultural production in the Jinzi Management Area of the Yinshan Commune in Zizhong County further realized the significance of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and expressed their desire to be red in the countryside and specialized in the countryside. Now, the vast majority of them have basically reached the standard of full attendance and high-efficiency shock workers, and half of them have been rated as "Five-Good" youths who love agricultural labor, have good attendance and labor, are good at learning production technology, are diligent and thrifty in loving the commune, and are good at studying culture.

After this group of young people arrived in the countryside, in addition to paying attention to arranging them to participate in suitable production according to their characteristics, Party and League organizations in various places also adopted various methods to help them master production skills as soon as possible. The Xinglong Commune in Yongchuan County adopted the following methods: inviting Party committee leaders and veteran farmers to explain agricultural production knowledge to young people, holding on-site meetings, carrying out activities of experienced workers guiding new workers, running amateur technical training classes, organizing them to visit production models, and carrying out activities to catch up with advanced individuals. In this way, more than 160 young people who newly participated in production in the entire commune quickly transformed from laymen to experts. Most people have learned various major farm works, 95% of them have completed and exceeded labor quotas, and more than ten people have become pacesetters in production. Zhang Yingyou, a young man who newly participated in agricultural production in the Ninth Management Area of this commune, has learned farm work such as digging holes, sowing seeds, fertilizing, eliminating pests, and plowing fields in the past two months, and has created the highest record for plowing fields in the entire management area.

This group of young people who newly participated in agricultural production have a certain level of education. Party and League organizations in various places organized them to conduct cultural studies, so that they can be further improved in agricultural labor. The Dashi Commune in Hechuan County divided 205 young people who newly participated in agricultural production into four classes according to their educational level. They usually study for one and a half hours every day and attend classes once a week. The commune invited school teachers to serve as teachers and class teachers. The young people are very satisfied with being able to closely combine the actual production with the study of cultural and scientific knowledge in labor, and the commune members also praised them as "new farmers who are capable of both writing and martial arts."

    树立以农为荣的思想
    四川党团组织加强对第一线青年的教育
    新华社成都17日电　四川省各地党、团组织热情地从政治思想上、生产技术上和文化知识上全面帮助全省一百多万新走上农业生产第一线的青年，使他们迅速在生产中发挥作用。
    四川省各地的党、团组织，在全省各行各业的一百多万青年到农业第一线参加生产后，就把加强对他们的思想教育，帮助他们巩固地树立以农为荣的思想作为一项重要任务。许多地方采取举行报告会、座谈会、举办业余团校等方法，使青年们进一步认识加强农业生产第一线的重大意义。资中县银山公社金紫管理区二百一十七名新参加农业生产的青年，经过学习进一步认识了大办农业、大办粮食的意义后，纷纷表示要红在农村、专在农村，现在绝大多数人已基本达到全勤、高工效突击手的标准，有一半人还被评为热爱农业劳动思想好、出工满勤劳动好、学习生产技术好、勤俭节约爱社好和学习文化好的“五好”青年。
    这批青年到农村后，各地党、团组织除了注意根据他们的特点安排他们参加合适的生产外，还采取各种办法，帮助他们尽快掌握生产技能。永川县兴隆公社采取的方法是：请党委负责人和老农等向青年讲解农业生产知识，召开现场会，开展老手带新手活动，举办业余技术训练班，组织他们访问生产模范和开展赶先进活动等。这样，就使全社一百六十多名新参加生产的青年迅速由外行变成内行，大多数人学会了各种主要农活，有95％的人完成和超过了劳动定额，有十多人还成了生产上的标兵。这个公社第九管理区新参加农业生产的青年张英友，两个多月来已学会打窝、下种、施肥、除虫、犁田等农活，并创造了全管理区犁田的最高纪录。
    这批新参加农业生产的青年都有一定的文化水平，各地党、团组织就组织他们进行文化学习，使他们在农业劳动中进一步得到提高。合川县大石公社将二百零五名新参加农业生产的青年按文化程度编为四个班，平时每天学习一小时半，每周集中上课一次。公社请学校教师担任教学和班主任工作。青年们对在劳动中能密切结合生产实际学习文化科学知识都很满意，社员们也称赞他们是“能文能武的新农民”。
