Brotherly Friendship
Xu Guangda, Head of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Delegation to the Soviet Union

At the invitation of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, our delegation from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, representing people from all walks of life in China and carrying the respect and friendship of the Chinese people for the great Soviet people, went to the Soviet Union to participate in the celebration activities held by the Soviet people for the 11th anniversary of the founding of our country, and conducted a friendly visit.

Our delegation arrived in Moscow on September 28th. During the half-month visit, we participated in the Moscow celebration of the 11th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, as well as the celebrations and Sino-Soviet friendship evenings held in Minsk, Riga, Irkutsk, and Bratsk; visited some factories, farms, hydroelectric power stations, and universities, and had cordial talks with workers, farmers, cadres, students, members of communist labor brigades, and activists enthusiastic about Sino-Soviet friendship. Wherever we went, we were warmly received and treated with brotherly care by the Soviet people. We also repeatedly conveyed to them the respect and greetings of the Chinese people to the great Soviet people.

The Moscow celebration of the 11th anniversary of the founding of our country was held on the evening of September 29th, with the participation of more than 1,000 people from all walks of life in the Soviet Union. The celebrations in the capitals of the two republics of Belarus and Latvia, and the city of Irkutsk, were held after the delegation arrived in those places. At each celebration, in addition to reports on China by the heads of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, representatives of workers, youth, and intellectuals warmly congratulated our people.

During the visit, the Soviet Union's communist construction left us with a deep impression. From the Gulf of Bothnia to Siberia, we were pleased to see that the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, have launched a comprehensive communist construction.

In Moscow, we visited the largest bearing production enterprise in Europe—the State-owned First Bearing Factory. The factory currently produces millions of bearings with different structures, precision levels, and sizes each year. Upon completion of the Seven-Year Plan, the production capacity will increase by 75% without expanding the factory area. To this end, they are vigorously promoting automated production. We visited the factory's first automated workshop. This is a workshop that was put into production in 1956, equipped with two integrated automatic operation lines—one for processing ball bearings and one for processing tapered roller bearings. The entire production process, from preparation, quenching, grinding, to assembly, inspection, and packaging, is automated. This workshop has only 170 technicians and can produce 5,500 sets of first-class quality bearings per day and night. By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, five such new and huge automated workshops will be put into production. By then, automated production of bearings will reach 80%, and the entire enterprise will become an automated factory.

In Minsk, the capital of the Belarusian Republic, our delegation visited the Minsk Automobile Manufacturing Plant. More than ten years ago, the German fascist bandits turned this city into a scorched earth. Today, it appears before us as a brand-new, beautiful city full of national style and heroic spirit. The automobile factory is in its suburbs. Comrade Jiaomin, the director of the factory, proudly told us that this automobile factory was built by Belarusian guerrillas. After the end of the Great Patriotic War, they walked out of the forest and threw themselves into construction work in the ravaged countryside with the spirit of combat. In 1947, this factory produced the first batch of six-ton dump trucks. Production has greatly developed in recent years, and by 1958, it was able to manufacture 40-ton dump trucks. The Belarusian people, who have experienced the test of war, are now continuing to carry forward their revolutionary traditions in their construction posts, engaging in selfless labor, and striving to further build their beautiful life and defend world peace in a spirit of struggle. The Minsk Automobile Manufacturing Plant will increase production by about 50% in seven years, and the employees guarantee to reach the original production level of the last year of the Seven-Year Plan a year and a half ahead of schedule.

Riga is the capital of the Latvian Republic. We visited this beautiful city for four days. Latvia is a young Soviet republic on the Baltic coast. Having just restored Soviet power in 1940, it suffered the brutal destruction of German fascist bandits. In the past twenty years, the days when this republic truly engaged in peaceful construction were only fifteen or sixteen years. However, in this not-too-long historical period, great changes have taken place here. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, the heroic Latvian people quickly brought their industry to the pre-war level. Now, its output is almost nine times more than before the war! The industrial products of Soviet Latvia have gained increasing reputation not only in the Soviet Union but also abroad. We saw electrical equipment, radio equipment, etc., which the Latvian people are proud of, at the Latvian National Economic Achievement Exhibition. At the Riga Vehicle Manufacturing Plant, we saw electric train carriages supplied to the entire Soviet Union. The comrades in this factory told us that they will double their output in seven years.

The delegation was very pleased to have the opportunity to visit the famous Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station. This is currently the largest hydroelectric power station in the world among all those that have been built and are under construction. Those who are engaged in construction there are all Soviet communist youth league members and young people who are not afraid of difficulties and are willing to dedicate their youth to the magnificent cause of communism. The Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station construction site is located on the Angara River. Since 1955, heroic Soviet children have responded to the call of the Party and came to this uninhabited wilderness where only black bears appear and only barren mountains and weeds exist. They brave the severe cold of minus 50 degrees Celsius in winter and fight against the scorching heat and mosquitoes in summer, engaging in a brave battle with the untamed river. Now, the river has been cut off, and while building the dam, turbine units have begun to be installed. Comrade Jinding, the chief engineer who loves his work, accompanied us to visit this magnificent construction site. He introduced the history and future of the construction of this hydroelectric power station to us like the water of the Angara River. Six hydroelectric power stations with a total capacity of 16 million kilowatts will be built on the Angara River. Bratsk is the largest of them. This hydroelectric power station has a total of 20 turbine units, each with a power generation capacity of 220,000 to 250,000 kilowatts. Next year, this hydroelectric power station will begin to transmit electricity, and when the entire project is completed, its annual power generation will reach 22 billion kilowatt-hours.

During our delegation's stay in the Soviet Union, we also visited collective farms and collective fishing villages. The farmers and fishermen warmly welcomed us. In the Soviet countryside, as in the cities, farmers and fishermen are working hard to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

From cities to the countryside, the Soviet people are filled with a labor enthusiasm for building communism.

During this visit, we were deeply moved by the friendship and love shown by the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. Whether on the streets of Moscow, or in the factories of Minsk, whether on the construction site of Bratsk, or in the homes of Latvian fishermen, whether in the Belarusian Opera House, or in the universities of Minsk and Riga, those workers, farmers, cadres, students... their words and expressions were full of brotherly affection for the Chinese people. They are extremely concerned about our country's Great Leap Forward and people's communes. They expressed great joy when they learned that our people's communes are developing victoriously.

When the members of the Minsk Communist Labor Brigade heard us introduce the communist style of Chinese workers of "taking on difficulties, giving up honors, learning from the advanced, and helping the backward," they immediately wrote these four sentences in their notebooks. The Soviet people rejoice for every victory achieved by the Chinese people in implementing the Party's general line for building socialism. In our contact with these comrades, we once again realized how much the Soviet people cherish the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people based on the ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism.

We especially cannot forget the meetings with Soviet experts who were on Soviet soil and had helped with construction in our country. These Soviet expert comrades who had sprinkled their sweat on Chinese soil, including engineers, professors, and experts in other fields, greeted us with a fiery heart when they met the representatives sent by the Chinese people, and talked to us about their unforgettable days in China. They are full of kind and moving feelings for our Party, our government, and the people. I remember one Soviet expert saying: "I will never forget the days I spent in China. The meticulous care and brotherly friendship of the Chinese comrades will always be remembered in my heart." The consistent care, love, and gratitude of our Party, government, and people towards Soviet experts are deeply imprinted in their hearts. This profound impression forged by facts can never be erased.

The friendly visit of our Sino-Soviet Friendship Association delegation to the Soviet Union once again confirmed how deep and solid the friendship between our two peoples is, and once again severely attacked the conspiracies of imperialism and its lackeys to sow discord and slander and undermine Sino-Soviet friendship. Let us, under the ideological brilliance of Marxism-Leninism and on the basis of proletarian internationalism, further strengthen and develop the eternal, unbreakable, and brotherly great friendship between the great people of China and the Soviet Union!

We welcome the delegation of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association to visit our country with earnest hearts, and celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution together with the Chinese people.

    兄弟般的友谊
    中苏友好协会访苏代表团团长　许光达
    我们中苏友好协会代表团应苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会与苏中友好协会的邀请，作为中国各界人民的代表，带着中国人民对伟大苏联人民的敬意和友情，到苏联参加了苏联人民为我国建国十一周年举行的庆祝活动，并进行了友好访问。
    我们代表团在9月28日到达莫斯科。在半个月的访问过程中，我们参加了莫斯科各界庆祝中华人民共和国成立十一周年大会，以及明斯克、里加、伊尔库次克和布拉次克等城市举行的庆祝会和中苏友谊晚会；参观了一些工厂、农庄、水电站和大学等，并同工人、农民、干部、学生、共产主义劳动队的队员和热心于中苏友好工作的积极分子们进行了亲切的交谈。我们所到之处，受到了苏联人民热情的接待和兄弟般的关怀。我们也一再向他们转达了中国人民对伟大苏联人民的敬意和问候。
    莫斯科庆祝我国成立十一周年的集会是在9月29日晚上举行的。参加者有苏联各界人士一千多人。白俄罗斯和拉脱维亚两个共和国的首都及伊尔库次克市的庆祝会，是在代表团到达该地后举行的。在各个庆祝会上，除苏中友协负责人作了关于中国的报告以外，工人、青年和知识界的代表们都热烈地向我国人民祝贺。
    在参观访问中，苏联的共产主义建设给我们留下了深刻的印象。从波罗的海湾到西伯利亚，我们高兴地看到伟大的苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，展开了全面的共产主义的建设。
    在莫斯科，我们参观了欧洲最大的生产轴承的企业——国营第一轴承厂。这个厂目前每年生产几百万件具有不同结构、精密程度和尺寸的轴承。在完成七年计划时，在不扩大工厂面积的情况下，将使生产能力增长75％。为此，他们正在大力地推行自动化生产。我们参观了这个厂的第一个自动化车间。这是一个在1956年投入生产的车间，安装着两条综合自动作业线——一条加工滚珠轴承，一条加工锥状滚柱轴承。全部生产过程，从备料、淬火、研磨一直到装配、检查和包装，都是自动进行的。这个车间只有一百七十名技术工人，一昼夜可生产五千五百套头等质量的轴承。到七年计划末，全厂将有五个这样新的巨大的自动化车间投入生产。到那时，自动化生产的轴承将达到80％，整个企业就将变成自动化工厂。
    在白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克，我们代表团参观了明斯克汽车制造厂。十几年前，德国法西斯匪徒把这座城市变成了一片焦土。如今，它作为一座崭新的、优美的、富有民族风格和英雄气概的城市出现在我们面前。汽车厂就在它的郊区。厂长焦民同志自豪地告诉我们：这个汽车厂是白俄罗斯游击队员建成的。伟大卫国战争结束以后，他们走出森林，在被敌人蹂躏的乡土上，以战斗的气概投入了建设工作。1947年这个工厂生产了第一批载重六吨的自卸卡车。几年来生产有了很大的发展，到1958年已经能制造载重四十吨的自卸卡车了。经历了战争考验的白俄罗斯人民，如今在建设的岗位上，继续发扬着自己的革命传统，从事着忘我的劳动，以斗争的精神来进一步建设自己美好的生活，来保卫世界和平。明斯克汽车制造厂在七年内，将使生产增长50％左右，职工们保证提前一年半达到原定的七年计划的最后一年的生产水平。
    里加市是拉脱维亚共和国的首都。我们在这座美丽的城市访问了四天。拉脱维亚是波罗的海滨的一个年轻的苏维埃共和国。1940年刚刚恢复苏维埃政权不久，又遭受了德国法西斯匪徒的野蛮摧残。二十年来，这个共和国真正从事和平建设的日子，也不过十五六年。但，在这不算太长的历史时期，在这儿发生了巨大的变化，在党的领导下，在苏联各民族的帮助之下，英雄的拉脱维亚人民很快地就使自己的工业达到了战前的水平。现在，它的产量几乎超过战前的九倍！苏维埃拉脱维亚的工业品不仅在苏联，而且在国外也获得越来越大的声誉。我们在拉脱维亚国民经济成就展览会上看到了拉脱维亚人民引以为荣的电机设备、无线电器材等等。在里加车辆制造厂，我们看到了供应全苏联使用的电气火车车厢。这个厂的同志们告诉我们，七年间，他们将把产量增加两倍。
    代表团能有机会参观著名的布拉次克水电站，感到非常高兴。这是目前全世界所有已建成和正在兴建中的水电站中的最大的一个。在那儿从事建设的，都是一些不畏艰难困苦、勇往直前的愿为共产主义壮丽事业献出自己的青春的苏联共青团员和青年们。布拉次克水电站工地位于安加拉河上。从1955年以来，英勇的苏联儿女响应党的号召，来到这片没有人烟，只有黑熊出没，只有荒山乱草的旷野。他们在冬天冒着零下五十多度的严寒，在夏天抗击着酷暑和蚊虫，与不驯服的河流展开了勇敢的搏斗。如今，河流已被斩断，在修筑拦河坝的同时，已开始安装涡轮机组。酷爱自己的工作的总工程师金丁陪同我们参观了这座气魄雄伟的工地。他醉心地像安加拉河水似的滔滔不绝地向我们介绍修建这个水电站的历史和它的未来。在安加拉河上将兴建六个水电站，总功率达一千六百万瓩。布拉次克是其中最大的一个。这座水电站共安二十个涡轮机组，每一组发电能力二十二万到二十五万瓩。明年，这个水电站即将开始送电，全部工程告竣时，它一年的发电量到达二百二十亿度。
    我们代表团在苏联期间，也参观了集体农庄和集体渔庄。农民们和渔民们热情地欢迎了我们。在苏联的农村和城里一样，农民们和渔民们也在为提前完成七年计划而努力。
    从城市到农村，苏联各地人民洋溢着一片建设共产主义的劳动热情。
    在这次访问中间，苏联人民所表现出的对中国人民的友谊和热爱，使我们深受感动。无论是在莫斯科的街道上，还是在明斯克的工厂里，无论是在布拉次克工地上，还是在拉脱维亚渔民的家里，无论是在白俄罗斯歌舞剧场里，还是在明斯克和里加的大学里，那些工人、农民、干部、学生……他们一言一语，都洋溢着对中国人民兄弟般的深情厚意。他们对我国的大跃进和人民公社极为关心，当他们了解到我国人民公社正在胜利地发展时都表示非常高兴。
    明斯克共产主义劳动队的队员们，听到我们介绍中国工人发扬“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见落后就帮”的共产主义风格时，他们立刻把这四句话记到自己的本子上。苏联人民为中国人民在贯彻党的建设社会主义的总路线中所获得的每一个胜利而欢欣鼓舞。我们在和这些同志接触中，又一次体会到苏联人民是多么珍视基于马克思列宁主义思想基础之上的中苏人民友谊。
    我们尤其不能忘记在苏联土地上和曾在我国帮助进行建设的苏联专家们的会晤。这些曾把自己的汗水洒在中国土壤上的苏联专家同志们，包括工程师、教授和其他方面的专家，在与中国人民派遣的代表相逢时，他们怀着一颗火热的心迎接了我们，和我们畅叙了他们在中国难忘的日子。他们对我们党、我们政府和人民充满着亲切动人的感情。记得有一位苏联专家说：“我永远忘不掉在中国度过的日子。中国同志对我无微不至的关怀和兄弟般的友谊将永远铭记在我的心里。”我们的党、政府和人民对苏联专家始终如一的关怀、爱戴与感激之情，深深地印在他们的心中。这种用事实铸成的深刻的印象是永远磨灭不掉的。
    我们中苏友好协会代表团在苏联的友好访问，又一次证实了我们两国人民的友谊是多么深厚和坚固，又一次狠狠地打击了帝国主义及其走狗对中苏友谊的挑拨离间和诬蔑破坏的阴谋。让我们在马克思列宁主义的思想光辉照耀下，在无产阶级国际主义的基础上，进一步加强和发扬中苏两国伟大人民之间永恒的、牢不可破的、兄弟般的伟大友谊吧！
    我们怀着殷切的心情，欢迎苏中友好协会代表团前来我国访问，并和中国人民一起欢庆伟大的十月社会主义革命的四十三周年。
