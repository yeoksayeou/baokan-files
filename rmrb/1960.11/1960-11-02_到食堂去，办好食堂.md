　　Editorial Note

    Go to the Canteen, Run the Canteen Well
    Reading the news about the cadres sent to lower levels in the Kongzhongguo People's Commune earnestly running the public canteen well is quite enlightening.
    The broad masses of peasants say it well, "Not relying on father, not relying on mother, relying on the commune, relying on the Party, unwavering for thousands of generations, our sons and grandsons will run the canteen." This precisely demonstrates the ardent support of the broad masses for the canteen and their ardent desire to run the canteen well. Cadres sent to lower levels should enthusiastically care about this wish of the masses, go to the canteen, and work diligently with the masses to run the canteen well.
    To run the canteen well, it is necessary to correctly implement the Party's policies related to canteen work, such as the policies on planned grain use, saving grain, and so on.
    To run the canteen well, it is necessary to earnestly conduct investigation and research, to deeply understand the problems in canteen work, and to "have a clear understanding."
    To run the canteen well, it is necessary to kindly care about the warmth and cold of the masses, and to show consideration for the sufferings of the masses. Grain, coal, oil, salt, and vegetables, everything must be cared for. Winter is coming, and arrangements for getting through the winter should be made early. One must have emotional ties with the working people.
    To run the canteen well, it is necessary to eat, live, labor, and consult with the masses, without being special, without putting on airs. Truly live among the masses as an ordinary laborer.
    All of this is very important for running the canteen well, and it is also extremely beneficial for the transformation and improvement of cadres after being sent to lower levels. Let us all earnestly care for and effectively help run the public canteen even better! This is a major event related to improving the lives of the masses, promoting production development, and consolidating the people's commune. It is also a very good place for cadres sent to lower levels to train themselves.

    到食堂去，办好食堂
    读了空冢郭人民公社下放干部认真办好公共食堂的消息，颇有一点启发。
    农村广大群众说得好，“不靠爹，不靠娘，依靠公社依靠党，千秋万代不动摇，子子孙孙办食堂”。这正说明了广大群众对食堂的热烈拥护和办好食堂的热烈愿望。下放干部应该热情地关心群众这一愿望，到食堂去，和群众一起勤勤恳恳地办好食堂。
    办好食堂，需要正确地执行党的有关食堂工作的政策，譬如关于计划用粮、节约用粮的政策等等。
    办好食堂，需要认真地作一番调查研究，对食堂工作中的问题深知深解，“心中有数”。
    办好食堂，需要亲切关怀群众的寒暖，体贴群众的疾苦。粮、煤、油、盐、菜，样样要关心。冬天到了，要早作过冬的安排。要同劳动人民的感情脉脉相通。
    办好食堂，需要与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，不能特殊，不能摆架子。真正以一个普通劳动者的身份生活在群众之中。
    这一切，对于办好食堂都很重要，对于干部下放以后的改造和提高也极为有益。让我们都来认真地关心并切实地帮助把公共食堂办得更好吧！这是有关改善群众生活、促进生产发展、巩固人民公社的一件大事。这也是下放干部锻炼自己的一个很好的场所。
