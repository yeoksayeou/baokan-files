Editor's Note: Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, is the long-term living base of Comrade Liu Qing, the author of "History of Entrepreneurship," where he obtained first-hand materials for writing the novel. Recently, Comrade Hu Cai, Vice Chairman of the Xi'an Branch of the Chinese Writers Association, invited some comrades in Chang'an County to discuss "History of Entrepreneurship." The full record of the discussion was published in the November 5th issue of the "Shaanxi Daily." Here, we publish a portion of the speeches.

    A Paean to the Agricultural Cooperation Movement
    Liu Guozhu (Deputy Secretary of the County-Level Organ Committee of the CCP in Chang'an County):
    Since the publication of the first part of Comrade Liu Qing's novel "History of Entrepreneurship," I have carefully read it several times. Each time I finish reading it, I gain a lot. The more I read, the more energetic I feel, and the more flavorful it becomes. It's as if every character in the novel is related to me, and every character's image seems so familiar. I am deeply attracted by the work's high level of ideological and artistic merit. In this work, the author sings with great political enthusiasm the initiative of the vast number of Chinese farmers, under the leadership of the Party, to consciously and resolutely take the socialist road, and profoundly reflects the spiritual outlook of people from all classes and strata in the vast rural areas during the early stage of China's agricultural cooperation. In this work, the author firmly grasped the most essential contradiction of the two-road struggle. Through the struggle of Liang Sanlaohan's family to establish a home and start a business, and the growth of a mutual aid team, the author presents a sharp and complex struggle scene to the readers. The vast number of Chinese farmers, represented by the poor peasant youth Liang Shengbao, under the leadership of the Party, consciously and resolutely took the socialist road and launched a fierce struggle against the anti-socialist forces represented by the rich peasant Yao Shijie, and the capitalist spontaneous forces represented by the well-to-do middle peasants Guo Shifu, Liang Shenglu, and Guo Zhenshan. Through this sharp and complex class struggle, the socialist front is constantly expanding, and the capitalist front is shrinking. At the same time, the author also specifically and vividly tells the readers in this work whom we should rely on, whom we should unite, and whom we should oppose in the struggle between the two roads, so as to establish the strong belief that socialism will inevitably win and capitalism will inevitably die.
    It is particularly worth mentioning that the author successfully shaped the heroic image of the young peasant Liang Shengbao in this work, allowing readers to clearly see the new generation that is growing up under the education and cultivation of the Party. They are all ordinary poor farmers who do common things in their daily lives, but deep in their minds, extraordinary brilliance shines. Liang Shengbao, who tasted the bitterness of life in the old society, is a typical example of these brilliant figures. Before liberation, Liang Shengbao also had the dream of creating a personal family business and had racked his brains and suffered all kinds of hardships, but ultimately failed. In the end, he went to the Zhongnan Mountains to become an underground peasant. After liberation, under the education of the Party, Liang Shengbao quickly found a way to create a cause for the people. He poured all his energy into this great cause. He showed a high degree of heroism in the struggle to create this great cause. In the struggle against capitalist spontaneous forces, his position was firm, his boundaries were clear, and he was not afraid of risks or difficulties. No matter what the situation, he did not relax his struggle against capitalism. He dared to shoulder the heavy responsibility of transforming society, and even in the most difficult situations, he did not lose confidence in the inevitable victory of socialism. For example, when he bought rice seeds, his stepfather opposed him; the mutual aid team caused family discord. More seriously, under the influence of capitalist spontaneous forces, some members of the mutual aid team withdrew, and some wavered. Guo Zhenshan, the village representative director, made things difficult for him and did not support him, and the well-to-do middle peasants opposed him, and the rich peasants sabotaged him, and so on. However, none of these shook his confidence. On the contrary, he overcame these difficulties with full confidence. Why was Liang Shengbao able to overcome these difficulties? As he said to Gao Zengfu: "With the Party, what are we afraid of?" Precisely because of this, Liang Shengbao was able to stand invincible in the face of hardship.
    In this work, Comrade Liu Qing, through many character images, explained the greatness of the Party, the correctness of the Party's policies, and what attitude one should take towards the revolutionary cause. Undoubtedly, readers will receive very valuable education from the advanced character images in this work.
    One of the characteristics of this work is that the author profoundly and systematically links family struggles, social struggles, and intra-Party struggles together and presents them to the readers, not only revealing the internal contradictions among the people and the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy manifested in the process of socialist revolution in our rural areas, but also appropriately solving them through the changes in the characters and events in the novel. This way of writing deepens our understanding of class struggle during the period of socialist construction.
    In short, I have a very deep feeling after reading this work. Whether it is the plot, the characters, or the language skills, they are all very real and completely a true evolutionary history of the agricultural cooperation movement.
    The success of this work in many aspects is the result of Comrade Liu Qing's efforts to study Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and conscientiously implement the Party's literary and artistic policies. Comrade Liu Qing settled down in Huangfu Village, Chang'an in 1952, and lived among the masses day after day for eight years. Even during his busy writing, he did not relax his contact with the broad masses. He did not appear among the masses as a writer, but as an ordinary Party member and ordinary worker. He was among the masses, not above or outside them. Comrade Liu Qing directly participated in the masses' fiery revolutionary struggle. He shared the breath and destiny of the local masses and had a flesh-and-blood relationship with them. This is an important reason why Comrade Liu Qing was able to write this excellent work.

    Truthfully Write the Complex and Sharp Class Struggle
    Meng Weigang (Director of Wangqu People's Commune):
    I have read the first part of Comrade Liu Qing's "History of Entrepreneurship" three times. It can be said that this novel is a history of the development of cooperation, a history of class struggle, and a history of the victory of the Party's leadership of the cooperative movement. Comrade Liu Qing used the viewpoint of class analysis to write this book. Therefore, the rural class struggle in the early stage of cooperation is written very realistically. As soon as you read this book, you are immediately attracted to the cooperative movement of a few years ago. The heated cooperative movement in the countryside at that time, and the complex and sharp class struggle, truly appear before the readers. From the Liang Sanlaohan family, from Liang Shengbao, Ren Lao Si, and Gao Zengfu, it proves that farmers must take the road of cooperation; under the leadership of the Party, they will also actively take the road of cooperation. Liang Sanlaohan's grandfather, grandson, and three generations started a business. Liang Shengbao has more energy and is more capable than his grandfather and his father. He pulled the calf back to start a family business and raise cattle to grow land, but he did not succeed. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, Shengbao succeeded. However, what he is now creating is a socialist "cause" and a collective "family business."
    Comrade Liu Qing's novel, from beginning to end, implements the Party's mass line and class line. Liang Shengbao's grandfather, grandson, and three generations suffered from the exploitation of the landlord and had no way to go. "'Liberation', the world is ours," Liang Shengbao shouted out the strong desire that hundreds of millions of poor Chinese farmers had suppressed in their hearts for thousands of years. However, to live a prosperous life, to never be exploited, and to have no poverty, we must resolutely get rid of private ownership, follow the Communist Party firmly, and resolutely create a socialist "family business." Ren Lao Si and Guo Suo, after the land reform, were unable to resist the attacks of natural and man-made disasters due to the lack of draught animals and farm tools, and were on the verge of bankruptcy. They have no way out without taking the road of cooperation. It can be seen that the road of cooperation is proposed by the Party according to the urgent demands of the masses, and it is also completely in line with the objective laws of social development. At the same time, it is precisely because the Party in the countryside relied on poor farmers like Gao Zengfu and Ren Lao Si, who resolutely followed the Party and supported cooperation, that the victory of cooperation was achieved. The work exposes that the well-to-do middle peasant Guo Shifu is unwilling to participate in active lending and wants to compete with the mutual aid team; the rich peasant Yao Shijie resells grain, lends at usurious rates, and sabotages the mutual aid team, hating the new society; the spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside raise their heads, and so on. It can be seen that the author's class viewpoint is unusually clear. The whole book reflects the sharp and complex class struggle and the political attitudes of all classes in the countryside at that time. I think this book is a textbook of class struggle for rural cadres. It educates cadres to be like Liang Shengbao, who is selfless and extremely loyal to the cause of the Party, and not to become a degenerate Guo Zhenshan.

    Learn Liang Shengbao's Noble Qualities
    Pang Huinong (Peasant Author of Xiliu Commune, Chang'an County):
    I was very moved after reading Comrade Liu Qing's "History of Entrepreneurship." This novel is indeed a history of creating a socialist cause. I think we should read it as a living history. The book only writes about the growth and expansion of Liang Shengbao's mutual aid team under Zhongnan Mountain, but in its typical significance, it is a concentrated expression of our 500 million farmers heading towards the socialist cooperative cause under the leadership of the Party. Getting rid of private ownership is not an easy task; however, in order for our farmers to live a happier life, no longer be poor, and no longer be exploited, we must resolutely get rid of private ownership and take the cooperative road pointed out by the Party. Today, our people's communes have been unprecedentedly developed and consolidated, and have achieved great achievements. Looking back at the cooperative road we have taken, it is a profound education for us.
    The content of "History of Entrepreneurship" is profound and magnificent, the characters are vivid and real, and it is written meticulously and vividly. The croaking of frogs in Hama Tan, the debate between Shengbao and his father Liang Sanlaohan, the path that Gaixia took, Guo Zhenshan's tall stature and loud voice, Gao Zengfu's taciturn appearance but a fiery Party-loving heart hidden inside... all make people feel very cordial. I think the most successful thing is the group of farmers in Liang Shengbao's mutual aid team. Facing the sabotage of the rich peasants and the obstacles of spontaneous forces, they are not timid, they do not retreat, they stand up with a new fighting posture and move forward bravely. Liang Sanlaohan's two generations failed to start a business. Only under the leadership of the Party, creating a socialist cause, did his son Shengbao and his group of farmers succeed.
    I have learned a lot from "History of Entrepreneurship." During the cooperative movement, I worked in a mutual aid team, serving as the head of the mutual aid team until the establishment of the commune. Now that I have read "History of Entrepreneurship," reviewing the old things I experienced a few years ago, I have also received another education on class stand. Our rural cadres should learn Liang Shengbao's spirit of working for the Party and the collective, being selfless, and working hard, and despise Guo Zhenshan's degenerate and individualistic behavior. In terms of creation, I, as a beginner writer, have been greatly inspired and educated. We often write vivid negative characters, but the positive characters are not glorious. However, how glorious is Liang Shengbao in "History of Entrepreneurship"! Comrade Liu Qing completely concentrated his efforts on writing about the brilliance that he himself exudes after receiving the Party's education and being inspired by the image of the old Communist Party members; he got rid of the old idea of starting a personal business and immediately became a vigorous, spiritually sublime, and new hero with a communist style. Our era is an era of people starting businesses, and the era of starting businesses requires heroes of starting businesses. Liang Shengbao is a typical example of farmers with advanced thinking. Only by standing high and seeing far can Comrade Liu Qing write such brilliant characters. For the well-to-do middle peasant Guo Shifu, Comrade Liu Qing also wrote about his two-sidedness—supporting the People's Government and working well; but also having serious spontaneous capitalist ideas. He did not write the well-to-do middle peasants like rich peasants or landlords. In Chapter 28, Guo Shifu secretly wants to compete with Liang Shengbao and is secretly happy about the difficulties of Shengbao's mutual aid team, but when the rich peasant provokes him, he is very vigilant to avoid him. This is such a vivid manifestation of the two-sidedness of the well-to-do middle peasants. In terms of writing techniques, in addition to writing about the appearance, actions, and language of the characters, Comrade Liu Qing often has paragraphs describing inner activities and expressing the author's lyricism and opinions. I think this method is very good, allowing readers to observe each character's internal organs from the appearance at a glance, and deeply understand the characters and understand life.

    The Correct Creative Path of Revolutionary Writers
    Feng Zhijun (Clerk of Huangfu Management Area, Wangqu Commune):
    Comrade Liu Qing has settled down in our management area. Let me talk about Comrade Liu Qing's situation in our area! He has been a great help to us.
    Since Comrade Liu Qing came to Huangfu Village, he has become one with the masses and cadres. Since 1952, he has been working on mutual aid teams in our area. He always constantly inspired everyone with facts, educated everyone with socialist ideas, and when he discovered new active members in the masses, he always earnestly helped them grow up. He also patiently educated and waited for the masses who were lagging behind for a while. For example, the deputy leader of the mutual aid team, for a period of time, had backward thinking, did not want to attend meetings, was afraid of people looking for him, locked the street door, and hid at home to sleep. Comrade Liu Qing tirelessly searched for him all over the village to help him. When we were running the Victory Agricultural Cooperative, Comrade Liu Qing held meetings with us every day, pointing out how to run the work in the cooperative. In 1958, based on the phenomenon that the original land required a lot of fertilizer and the road to Shangyuan was far away and wasted a lot of labor, Comrade Liu Qing suggested that we engage in "production points," build livestock houses on the original land, accumulate fertilizer; in the field, threshing floors were built on the spot, and harvesting and threshing were done on the spot, which could save a lot of labor. He said to us: "If you can't get it done once, slowly make trouble; build a stable this year." Now our "production points" on the original land have everything, and they are doing very well, freeing up a lot of labor to engage in other production work, and the masses praise it very much. Comrade Liu Qing often gives us ideas, thinks of ways, and holds meetings with us, so the cadres and the masses respect him, and if they have something or a problem, they go to him. Not only is this the case with official matters, but even during his spare time, he often goes to the masses to talk about production and chat about family matters. He now writes in the morning and still goes to the fields in the afternoon, and often cares about the production and work of the village, the team, and the management area. This time, when he returned from Beijing after attending the Third National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, he first came to the management area to ask about the production situation. Comrade Liu Qing's novel writes everything so truthfully, it is the result of being with the masses all day long and becoming one with the masses. For example, he did not experience the situation in the 18th year of the Republic of China. If he did not have a close relationship with the masses and understand them in depth, how could he write so meticulously and truthfully? I read the first few chapters of "History of Entrepreneurship" to Wang Jiabin, one of the models in the novel. When he heard about Shengbao's failure to start a business in the old society and the famine in the 18th year of the Republic of China, as well as Shengbao's escape from being drafted and hiding in the Zhongnan Mountains, Jiabin felt so uncomfortable that his eyes turned red; when he read about the exploitation of the landlords, Jiabin was so angry that he cursed. In general, Comrade Liu Qing's "History of Entrepreneurship" is a good book. Comrade Liu Qing's writing resolutely implements the spirit of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, which is a good example worthy of our learning.

### 长安县人座谈《创业史》

    长安县人座谈《创业史》
    编者按：陕西省长安县是《创业史》作者柳青同志的长期生活根据地，作者在那里获得了写作《创业史》的第一手材料。最近中国作家协会西安分会副主席胡采同志在长安县邀请一部分同志座谈了《创业史》。全部座谈记录发表在11月5日《陕西日报》上。这里发表的是其中一部分发言。
    农业合作化运动的颂歌
    刘国柱（中共长安县县级机关委员会副书记）：
    柳青同志的长篇小说《创业史》第一部问世以来，我仔细地读了几遍。每读完一遍，就有不少的收获，越读越觉得有劲，越读越觉得有味道，好像小说里每一个人物都和自己有关，每一个人物的形象，都感到那么眼熟。我深深被这部作品高度的思想性和高度的艺术性所吸引。作者在这部作品里，以极大的政治热情，歌颂了我国广大农民在党的领导下，自觉地坚决地走社会主义道路的积极性，并深刻反映了我国农村农业合作化初期广大农民中各个阶级、各个阶层人们的精神面貌。作者在这部作品中紧紧抓住了两条道路斗争这个最本质的矛盾，通过梁三老汉一家人创家立业的斗争，和一个互助组的成长，在读者面前展示了一幅尖锐复杂的斗争场景。以贫农青年梁生宝为代表的我国广大农民，在党的领导下，自觉地、坚决地走社会主义道路，同以富农姚士杰为代表的反社会主义势力，以富裕中农郭世富、梁生禄、郭振山为代表的资本主义自发势力，展开了激烈的斗争。通过这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，不断地使社会主义阵地扩大，使资本主义阵地缩小。同时作者在这篇作品中，还具体生动地告诉读者，在两条道路的斗争中，我们要依靠什么人，团结什么人，反对什么人，从而使读者树立起社会主义必然胜利，资本主义必然死亡的坚强信念。
    特别值得提出的是作者在这部作品里成功地塑造了梁生宝这个青年农民的英雄形象，使读者从梁生宝身上，清楚地看到了在党的教育、培养下，正在成长着的一代新人。他们都是些普普通通的穷庄稼人，每天做着日常生活中屡见不鲜的事情，但是在他们的思想深处，却闪耀着不平凡的光辉。在旧社会饱尝了辛酸生活的梁生宝正是这些光辉形象中典型的一个。解放以前，梁生宝也曾有过创立个人家业的梦想，也曾费尽了心思，受尽了千辛万苦，终未成功。最后还是钻进终南山当地下农民去了。解放以后，在党的教育下，梁生宝很快找到了一条创人民之业的道路，他把全部的精力，贯注到了这个伟大的事业里去。他在创立这伟大事业的斗争中，表现出高度的英雄气概。在同资本主义自发势力的斗争中，立场坚定，界线鲜明，不避风险，不怕困难。不论在怎样的情况下，他都没有放松和资本主义的斗争。他敢于肩负起改造社会的重任，即使在最困难的情况下，他都没有失去社会主义必然胜利的信心。比如他买稻种的时候，继父反对；为了互助组的事情，闹的家庭不和。更严重的是在资本主义自发势力的影响下，互助组内有人退组，有人动摇，村代表主任郭振山对他为难、不支持，富裕中农的反对、富农的破坏，等等。但是，这些都没有动摇他的信心，相反的，他却信心百倍地克服了这些困难。梁生宝为什么能克服这些困难呢？正如他对高增福所说的：“有党，咱怕啥。”正因为有了这一条，才使梁生宝在艰难困苦中立于不败之地。
    柳青同志在这部作品里通过许多人物形象，说明了党的伟大，说明了党的政策的正确，说明了一个人对待革命事业，应该抱什么态度。无疑的，读者将从这部作品的先进人物形象中，得到很宝贵的教导。
    这部作品的一个特色，是作者深刻而系统地把家庭斗争和社会斗争、党内斗争联系在一起，在读者面前展现出来，不仅揭示了我国农村在进行社会主义革命的过程中所表现出来的人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾，并通过小说里的人物和事件的变化恰当地加以解决，这样写法，更加深了我们对于社会主义建设时期阶级斗争的认识。
    总之，读了这一部作品，我的感受是很深的，不论故事情节、人物形象、语言技巧，都是很真实的，完全是农业合作化运动的真实演变史。
    这部作品，能在多方面取得成功，是柳青同志努力学习毛泽东文艺思想、认真贯彻执行党的文艺方针的结果。柳青同志1952年在长安皇甫村安家落户，八年如一日地在群众中生活，即使在繁忙的写作中，他都没有放松过和广大群众的接触。他不是以作家的身份在群众中出现，而是以一个普通党员和普通劳动者的身份在群众中出现。他是在群众之中，而不是在群众之上或群众之外。柳青同志直接参加群众火热的革命斗争，他和当地群众同呼吸、共命运，有着血肉相连的关系。这是柳青同志能够写出这部优秀作品的重要原因。
    真实地写出复杂尖锐的阶级斗争
    孟维刚（王曲人民公社社长）：
    柳青同志的《创业史》第一部，我读过三遍，可以说这部小说是一部合作化发展史，阶级斗争史，又是党领导合作化运动的一部胜利史。柳青同志是用阶级分析的观点来写这部书的。因而，把合作化初期的农村阶级斗争写得很真实。一读这部书，马上就把人吸引到几年前的合作化运动中去了。当时农村中热火朝天的合作化运动，复杂、尖锐的阶级斗争，真实地出现在读者面前。从梁三老汉一家，从梁生宝、任老四、高增福身上，证明了农民必须走合作化道路；在党的领导下，他们也一定会积极走合作化道路。梁三老汉祖孙三辈创业，梁生宝比他爷、他爹的劲头都大，而且能干，他把小牛犊拉回来，就为的是创家立业、养牛种地，但是，没有创成。在解放以后，在党的领导下，生宝创成了。不过，他现在创的是社会主义的“事业”，集体的“家业”。
    柳青同志写的这部小说，自始至终，贯彻了党的群众路线和阶级路线。梁生宝祖孙三辈，受尽地主的压迫，无路可走。“解放啦”，“世事成了咱们的啦”，梁生宝喊出了中国亿万贫苦农民千百年来压在心底的强烈愿望。但是，要过富裕生活，要永远不受剥削，没有贫困，就必须走合作化道路，坚决地跟着共产党走，坚决地去创社会主义的“家业”。任老四、郭锁，土地改革后由于缺乏耕畜和农具，抵抗不住天灾人祸的袭击，临近破产边缘。他们不走合作化道路就没有任何出路。可以看出，合作化道路是党根据群众的迫切要求而提出来的，也是完全符合社会发展的客观规律的。同时，正是党在农村依靠了像高增福、任老四这样坚决跟着党走，拥护合作化的贫苦农民，才取得了合作化的胜利。作品暴露了富裕中农郭世富不愿参与活跃借贷，要和互助组比赛；富农姚士杰倒贩粮食、放高利贷、破坏互助组，仇恨新社会；农村资本主义自发势力抬起头来，等等。可以看出，作者的阶级观点是异常明确的，全书反映了当时农村中尖锐复杂的阶级斗争和各阶级的政治态度。我觉得，这部书对农村干部是一本阶级斗争的教科书。它教育干部要当大公无私，对党的事业无比忠实的梁生宝，不要当蜕化变质的郭振山。
    学习梁生宝的高贵品德庞惠农（长安县细柳公社农民作者）：
    柳青同志的《创业史》，我读了非常感动。这部小说的确是一部创社会主义之业的历史。我想，我们应该把它当做一部活的历史来读。书里只写了终南山下梁生宝互助组的成长壮大，但从其典型意义上讲，正是我们五亿农民在党的领导下，奔向社会主义合作化事业的集中表现。摆脱私有制，并不是一件容易的事；但是，我们农民要生活得更幸福，不再贫穷，不再受剥削，就必须坚决摆脱私有制，走党所指出的合作化道路。今天，我们的人民公社已经空前发展和巩固，取得伟大的成就，回过头来，看看走过的合作化道路，对我们是一次深刻的教育。
    《创业史》的内容深远宏伟，人物性格鲜明真实，写得细致、生动。蛤蟆滩的蛤蟆叫声、生宝和他爹梁三老汉的辩论、改霞走的小路、郭振山的高身材大嗓子、高增福外表沉默内心却藏着一颗火热的爱党的心……都令人感到非常亲切。我觉得，其中写得最成功的还是梁生宝互助组的这伙庄稼人，面对着富农的破坏、自发势力的阻碍，他们不胆怯，不退缩，以新的战斗姿态站起来，勇往直前。梁三老汉两辈创业未成，只有在党的领导下，创社会主义事业，他的儿子生宝这伙庄稼人就创成了。
    从《创业史》中我学习到不少东西。在合作化运动期间，我搞过互助组，当互助组长直到建社。现在读了《创业史》，重温一下几年前我经过的旧事，也重新受到一次阶级立场的教育。我们农村干部，应该学习梁生宝那种为党为集体、大公无私、艰苦奋斗的作风，唾弃郭振山蜕化变质、发展个人主义的行为。在创作方面，我这个初学写作者受到了很大启发和教育。我们常常是反面人物写得生动，正面人物写得没有光彩。但是，《创业史》中的梁生宝是多么光辉呀！柳青同志完全集中力量在写他受了党的教导、受了老共产党员形象的启示以后，本身所焕发出来的光彩；他摆脱了为个人发家创业的旧思想，就立刻变成为一个朝气勃勃、精神崇高、具有共产主义风格的新英雄。我们的时代就是人民创业的时代，创业时代就需要有创业的英雄。梁生宝就是具有先进思想的庄稼人的典型。柳青同志站得高、看得远，才能写出如此光辉的人物来。对富裕中农郭世富，柳青同志也写出了他的两面性——拥护人民政府、劳动好；而又具有严重的资本主义自发思想。并不是把富裕中农写得像富农或者地主。第二十八章中，郭世富暗中要和梁生宝比赛，为生宝互助组的困难暗中高兴，但当富农挑拨他时，他却很警惕地躲开了。这是多么生动的富裕中农两面性的表现呀。在写作手法上，柳青同志写人物的外貌和行动、语言以外，常常有刻划内心活动以及作者抒情、发表意见的段落，我觉得这个方法很好，使读者从外貌一下子观察到每个人物的五脏六腑，深刻地认识人物，认识生活。
    革命作家正确的创作道路冯志俊（王曲公社皇甫管理区文书）：
    柳青同志就在我们管理区安家落户着哩。我就谈谈柳青同志在我们那儿的情况吧！他对我们的帮助可大呢。
    柳青同志自来到皇甫村以后，就和群众、干部打成一片。从1952年起，他就在我们那儿搞互助组。他总是不断用事实启发大家，用社会主义思想教育大家，发现群众中新的积极分子出现时，总是认真帮助它成长起来。对一时落后的群众，他也耐心教育和等待。比如：互助组的副组长，有一个时期，思想落后了，不愿开会，怕人寻他，把街门锁上，自己躲在家里睡觉。柳青同志不厌其烦地满村找他，帮助他。我们办胜利农业社时，柳青同志天天和我们开会，指点怎样办社里的工作。1958年，根据原上地多需肥多，而上原的路又远、浪费大量劳力的现象，柳青同志建议我们搞
  “生产点”，在原上盖牲口房、积蓄肥料；在地里光场，就地收割碾打，可以节约很多劳力。他给我们说：“一次搞不起来，慢慢闹；今年先盖马房”。如今我们原上的
  “生产点”什么都有了，搞得很好，腾出大量劳力去搞别的生产活路，群众很称赞。柳青同志常给我们出主意、想办法，跟我们开会，所以干部、群众都尊敬他，有事有问题就去找他。不仅公事如此，就是他休息的闲空时间，也常到群众里去，谈生产，拉家常。他现在上午写作，下午还是到地里去，经常关心村里、队里、管理区的生产和工作。这次，他从北京开第三次全国文代会回来，首先到管理区来问生产情况。柳青同志的小说，把一切事情写得那么真，就是整天和群众在一起、和群众打成一片的结果。比方像民国十八年的情况，他又没经过，不是和群众关系紧密，了解得深入，怎能写得那么细致和真实呢？我给小说中模特儿之一的王家斌念《创业史》前几章，他听到生宝旧社会创家未成和民国十八年的灾荒，以及生宝躲壮丁钻终南山的情景，家斌难受得眼圈红了；念到地主的剥削，家斌气得骂了起来。总的说来，柳青同志的《创业史》是部好书。柳青同志写书，坚决贯彻了毛泽东文艺思想的精神，这是值得我们学习的好榜样。
