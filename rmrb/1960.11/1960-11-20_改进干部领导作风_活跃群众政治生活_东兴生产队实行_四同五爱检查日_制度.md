Improve Cadre Leadership Style and Activate Mass Political Life
Dongxing Production Team Implements "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day" System

(Reported by this newspaper) The Dongxing Production Team of Xiaozhai Commune, Hengshui County, Hebei Province, is promoting the "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day" system, closely integrating cadres' adherence to the "Four Togethernesses" and improvement of leadership style with the activation of mass political life. This has further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses for production, and powerfully promoted the current mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.

The "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day" is a development of the Three Loves Inspection Day (love of country, love of the commune, love of labor) that the Dongxing Production Team Party Branch carried out among cadres and the masses. In April of this year, when the Hengshui County Party Committee promoted the "Two-Five System" leadership experience, it issued a call to cadres at all levels throughout the county to adhere to the "Four Togethernesses" with commune members. This call was enthusiastically responded to by all party member cadres of the Dongxing Production Team. However, in the process of implementation, because some cadres had different attitudes towards adhering to the "Four Togethernesses," the actual effects were very different. All the cadres of the Second Team, acting as role models in everything they did, exemplarily implemented the regulations of eating, working, and discussing matters together with commune members. The relationship between cadres and the masses was close, everyone was in a good mood, and all tasks were done quickly and well. The cadres of the First Team, because some cadres did not sufficiently recognize the significance of adhering to the "Four Togethernesses," only formally implemented the "Four Togethernesses." Commune members had opinions about the cadres, and the production results were not high. After discovering this problem, the Party Branch, after repeated research, recently decided to establish a "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day" jointly participated in by cadres and the masses. Through the "Inspection Day" meeting, using the method of praising the advanced and helping the backward, they sought mutual supervision and mutual promotion to complete various production and work tasks. This method was warmly welcomed by the vast number of cadres and the masses after it was put forward. It has been widely promoted throughout the brigade since May.

The content of the "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day" is: cadres earnestly implement the "Four Togethernesses"; brigade and team cadres and other personnel should eat, live, work, and discuss matters together with commune members. Commune members earnestly implement the "Five Loves"; the "Five Loves" are: love of country, love of the commune, love of labor, love of learning, and love of research.

The "Inspection Day" meeting takes the production team as a unit, with all cadres participating as ordinary commune members, studying and implementing the Party's policies together with commune members, and discussing and resolving production and life issues that commune members are most concerned about. In terms of the meeting method, the method of affirming achievements, pointing out shortcomings, exchanging ideas with each other, and helping each other is adopted. For criticisms and suggestions raised by the masses, if they pertain to the cadres' "Four Togethernesses" work style or commune members' labor discipline, the relevant cadres and commune members should make self-criticisms. Suggestions for improving production work are mobilized for discussion among the masses, and those that can be resolved immediately are resolved immediately. Those that cannot be resolved immediately are submitted to the production team for special handling, so that every matter is accounted for.

In the half year since the implementation of the "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day," it has played a great role:

First, it has promoted the transformation of the cadres' work style, and there has been a great leap forward in work. There are thirty-five brigade and team cadres in the entire team. Previously, seven of them did not participate in labor frequently. After the implementation of the "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day," the cadres were supervised by the masses, which greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of cadres at all levels to take the lead in participating in production and leading production well. The transformation of the cadres' work style has promoted the deepening of work, so that the labor efficiency and production quality of the entire team have been greatly improved.

Second, it has further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses and enhanced the unity between cadres and the masses. In the past, if commune members had opinions about cadres, and cadres had opinions about commune members, they could not exchange them in a timely manner, which affected work and production. After the implementation of the "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day," cadres and the masses often held meetings together to exchange ideas and help each other, which increased mutual understanding and created a good situation of "cadres caring for the masses, and the masses caring for the cadres."

Third, through the "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day," the Party's policies can be timely implemented among the masses, so that the masses can consciously complete various work tasks on the basis of improving their political and ideological awareness.

Fourth, the "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves Inspection Day" is also a good form for mobilizing the masses to conduct self-education. In the past, some commune members had a poor attitude towards labor and did not abide by labor discipline, relying only on cadres to persuade them. After the implementation of the "Inspection Day" system, through the development of criticism and self-criticism methods, mutual assistance, and mutual supervision, not only has the masses' level of awareness been improved, but also the political unity between cadres and the masses and between the masses has been further enhanced.

Recently, the production team mobilized the masses to conduct an inspection and comparison of the implementation of the "Four Togethernesses and Five Loves." Seventeen team cadres and one hundred and forty-two commune members were rated as good "Four Togethernesses" cadres and good "Five Loves" commune members.

### 改进干部领导作风　活跃群众政治生活  东兴生产队实行“四同五爱检查日”制度

    改进干部领导作风　活跃群众政治生活
    东兴生产队实行“四同五爱检查日”制度
    本报讯　河北省衡水县小寨公社东兴生产队推行“四同五爱检查日”制度，把干部坚持“四同”、改进领导作风与活跃群众政治生活紧密结合起来，进一步密切了干部和群众关系，充分调动了群众的生产积极性，有力推动了当前大办农业大办粮食的群众运动。
    “四同五爱检查日”，是东兴生产队党支部在干部群众中开展三爱检查日（爱国、爱社、爱劳动）的基础上发展起来的。今年4月，中共衡水县委在推行“二五制”领导经验时，向全县各级干部发出了和社员坚持“四同”的号召。这个号召，得到东兴生产队全体党员干部的热烈响应。但在执行过程中，因为有的干部对坚持“四同”的态度不一样，实际效果很不相同。二小队的全体干部，处处以身作则，模范地执行同社员同吃、同劳动，遇事同商量的规定，干部群众关系密切，人人心情舒畅，样样活计做的又快又好；一小队的干部，因为有的干部对坚持“四同”意义认识不足，仅是形式上实行了“四同”，社员对干部有意见，生产上效果也不高。党支部发现这个问题以后，经过反复研究，最近确定：建立干部群众共同参加的“四同五爱检查日”，通过“检查日”会议，用表扬先进，帮助后进的办法，求得互相监督，互相促进，完成各项生产和工作任务。这个办法提出后，受到广大干部群众的热烈欢迎。从5月开始，在全大队普遍推广。
    “四同五爱检查日”的内容是：干部认真实行“四同”，大队小队干部和其他人员，要和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。社员认真实行“五爱”，“五爱”是：爱国、爱社、爱劳动、爱学习、爱钻研。
  “检查日”会议以生产队为单位，全体干部，以普通社员身份参加，和社员一起研究贯彻党的方针政策，讨论解决社员最关心的生产生活问题。在会议开法上，采用肯定成绩，指出缺点，互相交心，互相帮助的办法。对群众提出的批评建议，属于干部“四同”作风的和社员劳动纪律问题的，有关干部和社员要作自我批评。属于改进生产工作的建议，发动群众讨论，对有条件解决的，马上解决，马上解决不了的，提交生产队作专案处理，作到件件有交代。
      “四同五爱检查日”推行半年来，已发挥了很大作用：
    一、促进了干部作风转变，工作有很大跃进。全队共有三十五名大小队干部，以前，有七人不经常参加劳动，推行“四同五爱检查日”后，干部受到群众监督，大大调动了各级干部带头参加生产、领导搞好生产的积极性。干部作风的转变，促进了工作的深入，使全队劳动效率，生产质量，都有很大提高。
    二、进一步密切了干部和群众关系，增强了干部与群众之间的团结。过去社员对干部，干部对社员有了意见，不能及时交换，影响工作，影响生产。推行“四同五爱检查日”后，干部群众经常一起开会交心，互相帮助，增进了互相了解，出现了“干部关心群众，群众爱护干部”的大好局面。
    三、通过“四同五爱检查日”，能够及时的把党的方针政策贯彻到群众中去，使群众在提高政治思想觉悟的基础上，自觉地去完成各项工作任务。
    四、“四同五爱检查日”也是发动群众进行自我教育的一种良好形式。过去有的社员劳动态度不好，不遵守劳动纪律，只依靠干部说服。推行“检查日”制度后，通过开展批评、自我批评方法，互相帮助，互相监督，不光提高了群众的觉悟水平，而且也进一步增进了干部与群众、群众与群众彼此之间的政治团结。
    最近生产队发动群众对贯彻“四同五爱”进行了一次检查评比，有十七名队干部、一百四十二名社员，被评为“四同”好干部和“五爱”好社员。
