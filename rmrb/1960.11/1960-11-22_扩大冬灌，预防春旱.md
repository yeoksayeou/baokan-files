    The same manpower and resources, used at the right time, can achieve twice the result with half the effort and maintain the initiative step by step; missing the opportunity will lead to half the result with twice the effort and fall into a passive position. Winter irrigation is a strategic measure of great significance, making timely and rational use of water sources and labor, and seizing the initiative in the struggle against nature. From now until the ground freezes, it is a great time to carry out winter irrigation. In order to strive for a better summer harvest next year and to create better conditions for spring planting, we must seize the opportunity to carry out winter irrigation.
    Winter irrigation is a good experience that our people have mastered in long-term production practice to understand and conquer nature. In most parts of our country, there is very little rainfall in winter and spring, especially in North China and Northwest China, where winter and spring precipitation accounts for only about one-tenth of the annual total. Therefore, spring drought occurs to varying degrees every year. Through large-scale water conservancy construction, drought resistance has been continuously improved; however, the area of farmland that needs irrigation in spring is very large, and spring irrigation often faces problems such as labor shortages, insufficient water, or insufficient time for universal irrigation. In winter, however, a large amount of water is wasted without being fully utilized. Carrying out winter irrigation can not only make full use of water sources and eliminate possible spring drought this winter, but also alleviate the tension in labor and water use during spring production, which is greatly beneficial to improving cultivation quality and expanding irrigation area.
    Timely winter irrigation has a very significant effect on increasing crop production. According to surveys, winter-irrigated wheat, in conjunction with other agricultural techniques, has increased yields compared to non-winter-irrigated wheat. Winter-irrigated cotton fields can be sown earlier, with full and vigorous seedlings, increasing yields. Judging from the severe drought that occurred in many areas this spring, the effect of winter irrigation is even more significant. Wherever winter irrigation was carried out last winter, the summer harvest of crops this year was still relatively good, and spring planting also proceeded more smoothly.
    The purpose of winter irrigation is to provide overwintering crops with sufficient moisture to promote development and facilitate safe overwintering; and to store the winter’s surplus water in the soil on winter fallow land for use in the spring. Land that has been winter-irrigated, after harrowing, rolling, fertilization and other moisture-preserving measures, has a relatively high soil moisture content in the coming spring, which can generally meet the needs of wheat for moisture during overwintering and greening, and can reduce one spring irrigation. This makes the soil moisture suitable for spring-sown crops such as cotton, allowing timely sowing and ensuring complete emergence. Winter irrigation can also regulate soil temperature. Observation data from various places show that the temperature of winter-irrigated soil is generally 1 to 2 degrees Celsius higher than that of non-winter-irrigated soil, and the daily temperature fluctuation is 1 to 2 degrees smaller. Because the ground temperature is higher and the daily temperature changes are not too drastic, overwintering crops can be protected from or less affected by frost damage. According to a survey in Hebei Province, cotton fields that have been winter-irrigated have higher ground temperatures and suitable moisture, allowing sowing to be advanced by seven days to one solar term, which is greatly beneficial to improving cotton yield and quality. After winter irrigation, there is a period of night frost and daytime thawing, which can loosen the soil and promote the decomposition of fertilizer, which is also beneficial to crop growth. Winter irrigation also has a certain effect on eliminating pests and diseases.
    Winter irrigation is not an isolated measure; it must be closely coordinated with other agricultural techniques. Winter irrigation involves the rational use of water sources and water conservancy equipment, and requires close contact and unified arrangements between relevant units. Therefore, to do a good job in winter irrigation, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership and fully mobilize the masses. Party committees at all levels must take winter irrigation as an important task in current agricultural production and as an important key to winning greater victories on the agricultural production front next year, and grasp it firmly. In particular, areas in the north that are prone to spring drought and have winter irrigation conditions should carry out winter irrigation on wheat fields and winter fallow land. The seasonality of winter irrigation is relatively strong. In northern areas, this work should be completed before the severe cold freezes the ground. Leading cadres at all levels must go deep into the grassroots, go deep among the masses, find out the irrigation water sources, calculate the water volume, comprehensively consider and uniformly arrange the water used for winter and spring irrigation, properly arrange the labor force for winter irrigation, find the most labor-saving irrigation methods, and improve irrigation efficiency. It is necessary to ensure that winter irrigation is completed in a timely manner, and to do a good job in other agricultural and sideline production activities, while ensuring a balance between work and rest.
    During the winter irrigation period for wheat, the wheat seedlings are small and the weather is cold. Special attention should be paid to irrigation techniques, paying attention to mastering the right time and amount to prevent damage to the wheat seedlings due to excessive water volume, or root breakage due to freezing if irrigation is too late. The masses in various places have very good winter irrigation experience, which should be investigated and summarized. Generally speaking, the winter irrigation time is from around "Minor Snow" to after the ground freezes. It can be carried out during the period when the soil freezes at night and thaws during the day. The amount of irrigation water can be greater than the amount of irrigation water during the growing season. The irrigation time for blank land can be slightly advanced, and the amount of irrigation water can be greater. In addition, attention must be paid to close integration with other agricultural measures. After irrigation, harrowing and rolling should be carried out to prevent the land from cracking. More attention should be paid to moisture conservation measures for blank land irrigation. At the same time, winter irrigation should also pay attention to adapting to local conditions. In some places in the south, overwintering crops need to be irrigated, and in some places, ditches need to be cleared for drainage. In saline-alkali areas in the north, winter irrigation can be combined with washing alkali to improve the soil. Of course, land with more moisture can be irrigated less or not irrigated.
    While preparing for and carrying out winter irrigation, all localities should pay special attention to storing and conserving water and saving water, and make preparations for spring irrigation water. We must do everything possible to divert and store all usable water, so that water can be stored in slack times and used in busy times. In the north, methods such as storing water to raise ice and sweeping snow back to the fields can also be adopted to expand irrigation water sources. A comprehensive plan should be made for winter and spring irrigation water consumption, using live water first and then dead water, and trying to reduce water loss so that the limited water can irrigate more land.
    This winter, water conservancy projects should concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in supporting work. First of all, we must firmly grasp the projects that can exert the benefits of winter irrigation, improve the canal system, open up ditches, and build good ridges. Water lifting machinery and equipment should also be installed and maintained in a timely manner. In short, we must strive to achieve smooth water diversion and uniform irrigation, and expand the winter irrigation area as much as possible.
    The "Minor Snow" season has arrived; in most parts of the north, the most suitable season for winter irrigation is in the month or so after "Minor Snow". As long as labor, water sources, and tools are properly arranged, and every effort is made to increase income and reduce expenditure, it is possible to universally irrigate wheat fields and winter fallow land with irrigation conditions during this period. For each commune and production team, the most suitable winter irrigation time is not very long, so we must seize the opportunity and do it as quickly as possible. We must not only make overwintering crops develop healthily and overwinter safely, but also prevent possible spring drought next year. This requires even more urgent winter irrigation. This is extremely closely related to the overall victory of large-scale agriculture and large-scale grain production next year, and we must do a better job in this year's winter irrigation than in any previous year!

    扩大冬灌，预防春旱
    同样的人力物力，用得适时，可以事半功倍，步步主动；误了时机，就会事倍功半，陷于被动。冬灌，是适时地合理地利用水源和劳动力，在向大自然作斗争中夺取主动权的一项具有战略意义的措施。从现在开始，到封冻为止，正是进行冬灌的大好时机。为了争取明年有一个更好的夏收，为了给明年春播创造一个更好的条件，都必须抓紧时机，进行冬灌。
    冬灌，是我国人民在长期的生产实践中掌握自然规律用以征服自然的一个好经验。我国大部地区冬春雨量很少，特别是华北、西北地区，冬春降水量只占全年的十分之一左右；因此，每年都有程度不同的春旱现象发生。经过大兴水利，抗旱能力不断地有所提高；但是，春季需要灌溉的农田面积很大，在春灌中往往出现劳力紧张、水量不足或者时间来不及普遍灌溉的情况。而冬季却有大量的水源白白流走，未能充分利用。进行冬灌，不但可以充分利用水源，把可能发生的春旱消灭在今冬，而且可以缓和春季生产用人用水紧张的程度，大大有利于提高耕作质量，扩大灌溉面积。
    适时进行冬灌，对作物增产效果非常显著。据调查，冬灌过的小麦，配合其他农业技术措施，比没有冬灌的产量都有增加。冬灌过的棉田，可以提早播种，苗全苗旺，提高产量。由今年不少地区春季发生了严重的干旱的情况看，冬灌的效果更加显著。凡是去冬进行过冬灌的，今年夏收作物的收成仍然比较好，春播也进行得比较顺利。
    冬灌的目的，就是给越冬作物以足够的水分，促进发育，有利于安全越冬；在冬闲地上把冬季的闲水储存在土壤里，供春季使用。冬灌过的土地，经过耙耱、镇压、施肥等保墒措施，到来春土壤含水率比较高，一般可以满足小麦越冬和返青时期对水分的需要，可以减少一次春季灌溉用水；这就使棉花等春播作物田地有适宜的水分，可以及时播种，保证出苗齐全。冬灌还可以调节土壤温度。各地观测材料说明，冬灌过的土壤，比没有冬灌的土壤，温度一般高摄氏一度到二度，地温每天变化的幅度小一度到二度。由于地温较高，每天温度变化不太急剧，就可以使越冬作物不受或少受冻害。又据河北省的调查，经过冬灌的棉田，地温较高，水分适宜，可以提前七天到一个节令播种，这就大大有利于提高棉花的产量和质量。冬灌后有一个时期夜冻昼消，可以使土壤疏松，可以促进肥料腐烂分解，这也有利于作物生长。冬灌对消灭病虫害也有一定的作用。
    冬灌不是一项孤立的措施，它必须同其它农业技术措施密切配合。冬灌涉及水源和水利设备的合理利用问题，又必须有关单位之间密切联系、统一安排。因此，要做好冬灌工作，必须加强组织领导，充分发动群众。各级党委要把冬灌作为当前农业生产中一项重要工作，作为争取明年农业生产战线上获得更大胜利的重要关键，紧紧抓住。特别是北方易受春旱而又有冬灌条件的地区，更应该把麦田和冬闲地普遍地进行一次冬灌。冬灌的季节性比较强，北方地区要在严寒封冻前做完这个工作。各级领导干部要深入基层、深入群众，摸清灌溉水源，算好水量账，把冬灌和春灌的用水，全面考虑，统一安排，妥善安排好冬灌的劳动力，找出最节约劳动力的灌溉方法，提高灌水效率。既要保证冬灌及时完成，又要做好其他的农业、副业生产活动，同时还要保证做到劳逸结合。
    小麦冬灌时期，麦苗幼小，天气寒冷，应该特别讲究灌水技术，注意掌握适时、适量，防止因水量过大损伤麦苗，或者灌水时间过晚因冰冻而发生断根现象。各地群众中都有很好的冬灌经验，应该调查总结。冬灌时间，一般地说，是从“小雪”前后开始到封冻后为止，在土壤夜冻昼消的期间都可以进行，灌水量可以比生长期灌水量大；白地灌水时间还可稍为提早，灌水量可以更大一些。此外，还必须注意同其他农业措施密切结合。灌后进行耙耱、镇压，防止土地龟裂。白地灌溉更要注意保墒措施。同时，冬灌还要注意因地制宜。南方有些地方越冬作物要灌溉，有些地方要清沟排水。北方盐碱地区可以结合冬灌洗碱改良土壤。水分较多的土地，当然也可以少灌或不灌。
    各地在准备和进行冬灌的同时，还要特别注意蓄水保水和节约用水，做好春灌用水准备。要千方百计地引蓄一切可以利用的水，做到闲时蓄水忙时用。北方还可以采取蓄水养冰、扫雪归田等等办法，扩大灌溉水源。对于冬春灌溉用水量，要做全面规划，先用活水，后用死水，设法减少水量损失，使有限的水量能浇更多的土地。
    今冬水利工程要集中力量搞好配套工作。首先要抓紧做好冬灌能发挥效益的工程，健全渠系，开好沟，打好畦；提水机具也要及时配套安装、维修。总之，要力求做到引水通畅、灌水均匀，尽可能扩大冬灌面积。
    “小雪”季节已经到来；北方大部地区，冬灌的最适宜的季节就在“小雪”以后的一个多月里。只要把劳力、水源、工具妥善地加以安排，千方百计开源节流，在这个期间把有灌溉条件的麦田和冬闲田普浇一次，是能够做到的。从每一个公社和生产队来说，最适宜的冬灌时间却又不是很长，必须抓紧时机，作得越快越好。我们既要使越冬作物发育健壮，安全越冬。同时，还要预防明年可能发生的春旱。这就更加需要抓紧冬灌。这同明年大办农业、大办粮食的全面胜利有极为密切的关系，一定要把今年的冬灌工作做得比以往任何一年更好！
