    New Type of Cotton Stalk Peeling Machine
    After many experiments, the workers of the Hefei Textile Machinery Factory in Anhui Province have successfully trial-produced a new type of cotton stalk peeling machine. At present, six textile machinery factories and textile factories in Hefei, Wuhu, Bengbu, Anqing and other places have manufactured 1,300 units of this cotton stalk peeling machine, which are being shipped to various cotton producing areas one after another.
    This machine concentrates the advantages of many kinds of cotton stalk peeling machines in other provinces, with simple structure, high efficiency and easy operation. It can be driven by electric power and machinery, or by animal power and manpower. Each machine can peel 36 to 40 jin of cotton stalk skin per hour, which improves work efficiency by five to seven times compared with manual peeling.

    新型棉秆剥皮机
    安徽省合肥纺织机械厂职工经过多次试验，试制成功了一种新型棉秆剥皮机。现在，合肥、芜湖、蚌埠、安庆等地的六个纺织机械厂和纺织厂，已制成这种棉秆剥皮机一千三百台，陆续运往各棉产区。
    这种机器集中了外省许多种棉秆剥皮机的优点，结构简单、效率高，操作简便，可以用电力、机械带动，也可以用畜力、人力。一部机器每小时可以剥棉秆皮三十六斤到四十斤，比手剥提高工效五倍到七倍。
