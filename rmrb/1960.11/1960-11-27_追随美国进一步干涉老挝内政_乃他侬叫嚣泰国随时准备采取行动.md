Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 26th: Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Sarit Thanarat has once again issued a clamor to take action to further interfere in Laos' internal affairs.

Following the statement by the U.S. State Department, Sarit Thanarat, on the 24th, spoke to the press, openly opposing the agreement reached between the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Patriotic Front to form a coalition government, saying that this agreement was "a dangerous signal." He also declared that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization had assured Thailand that if the situation in Laos made "joint action" necessary, this aggressive bloc would "cooperate" with the Thai government.

Sarit Thanarat also revealed that the Southeast Asia Treaty aggressive bloc, controlled by the United States, was "paying attention" to the latest developments in the Lao situation. He threatened that the results of the recent Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military advisory meeting in Bangkok had brought "confidence" to Thailand.

Sarit Thanarat vociferated that Thailand is ready to implement the resolutions of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization at any time, and hopes that other member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization will take the same action.

    乃他侬叫嚣泰国随时准备采取行动
    新华社26日讯　曼谷消息：泰国副总理兼国防部长乃他侬又发出了要采取行动进一步干涉老挝内政的叫嚣。
    继美国国务院声明之后，乃他侬24日向报界发表谈话，公然反对老挝王国政府和老挝爱国战线党达成组织联合政府的协议，说什么这种协议是“一种危险讯号”。他并且宣称，东南亚条约组织已向泰国保证，如果老挝事件使得“联合行动”成为必要时，这个侵略集团将同泰国政府“合作”。
    乃他侬还透露，美国控制下的东南亚条约侵略集团对于老挝局势的最新发展“表示注意”。他扬言，最近在曼谷举行的东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议的结果给泰国带来了“信心”。
    乃他侬叫嚣说，泰国随时准备执行东南亚条约组织的决议，同时希望东南亚条约组织的其他成员国也采取同样的行动。
