Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th – Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces broadcast today: A spokesman for the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement condemning U.S. State Department spokesman White’s recent public intimidation regarding Laos’ decision to accept aid from the Soviet Union, the People’s Republic of China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The spokesman for the Lao Patriotic Front said, "The above clamor by the U.S. authorities clearly confesses that U.S. imperialism is still stubbornly continuing to threaten and coerce the legitimate government of Laos, and further obstruct Laos from following the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony that conforms to the wishes of all Lao people."

The spokesman pointed out, "While engaging in open intimidation, the U.S. imperialists are also increasing the number of American officers and transporting weapons to help the Phoumi-Boun Oum treacherous group, thereby expanding the civil war and killing the Lao people."

The spokesman also pointed out, "Now, the U.S. imperialists are colluding with the Thai reactionary clique of Sarit Thanarat, and are trying their best to instigate the Lao treacherous group to attack Vientiane, plotting to subvert Prince Souvanna Phouma’s legitimate government, in order to establish a puppet government to act as a U.S. lackey, and to use this as a tool to undermine Laos’ peace, neutrality, and national harmony."

The spokesman emphasized, "The negotiations and signing of the communiqué between the Kingdom Government and the Lao Patriotic Front are entirely internal affairs of Laos. The content of the communiqué aims to achieve genuine peace, neutrality, and national harmony, which fully conforms to the interests of our motherland and the genuine demands and aspirations of the Lao people. The above intimidating and coercive attitude of the U.S. authorities towards the legitimate government of Laos is a blatant interference in Laos' internal affairs, a serious violation of Laos' independence and sovereignty, and an act of trampling on international law."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th – Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces broadcast a commentary today saying that when U.S. imperialism vigorously supported the Phoumi-Boun Oum treacherous group in undermining the path of peace, neutrality, national harmony, and a unified country, and attacked the Kingdom Government and the people from all sides, Prime Minister Phouma of the Kingdom Government visited Sam Neua, and issued a joint communiqué after talks with Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, which was undoubtedly a powerful blow to the enemy. The commentary said that the publication of the joint communiqué demonstrated the unity of the government, the people, and the patriotic and peace-loving forces, and showed that the united forces represented by the Kingdom Government and the Lao Patriotic Front adhered to safeguarding the interests of the Lao nation and people, resolutely followed the path of genuine peace and neutrality, and resolutely opposed the enemies of the Lao nation, the enemies of the Lao people's peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

The commentary said that the joint communiqué issued by the two princes would be supported by people of all nationalities, strata, religions, and parties in Laos, as well as all people who support the legitimate government, oppose the enemies of all nationalities, and advocate the practical realization of a policy of peace and neutrality. At the same time, it would also be supported by peace-loving and just people around the world.

The commentary pointed out that U.S. imperialism would become even more frenzied because of this, and would further employ its usual tricks—exerting pressure and providing more "aid" to its lackeys, in order to continue sabotage. However, as the two princes pointed out in the joint communiqué, it is the strength of the Lao people that determines the issue. The Lao people are determined to follow the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, resolutely support the government's efforts, and resolutely oppose the sabotage schemes of U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan treacherous group. Final victory will surely belong to the Lao people.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th – Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces broadcast today: More than 500 people from four villages in Phongsaly Province held a rally on the 22nd to oppose the Phoumi Nosavan treacherous group's rebellion in Luang Prabang and the atrocities of this group's henchmen who constantly persecuted the people of Phongsaly.

The masses attending the meeting unanimously adopted a proposal to the King of Laos, the Phouma government, the National Assembly, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, and the Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and a Unified Country, expressing their support for the government's acceptance of aid from the Soviet Union and the establishment of friendly relations with the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

More than 200 people in Muang Phuan Village, Xiangkhouang District, Sam Neua Province, held a rally on the 18th to welcome the achievements of the Kingdom Government delegation and the Lao Patriotic Front delegation in the negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 25th – According to a broadcast today by Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces, people of all ethnic groups from four villages in Khamkeut District, Khammouane Province, held a rally on November 10 to express their support for the Phouma government, the policies of the Lao Patriotic Front and the Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and a Unified Country, and to oppose the Phoumi Nosavan treacherous group's schemes to attack Vientiane and North Kading, as well as their schemes to force young people into the army and drive people into disguised concentration camps.

A proposal unanimously adopted at the meeting condemned U.S. imperialism and its lackeys for supporting the Phoumi Nosavan treacherous group in opposing the Kingdom Government and the constitution, undermining the path of peace and neutrality, and expanding the civil war. The proposal demanded that the Kingdom Government drive out the henchmen of the Phoumi treacherous group who have infiltrated the Kingdom's army and administrative organs at all levels, accept aid from the Soviet Union as soon as possible, and establish friendly relations with the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The Khamkeut District Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, enlightened people in Khamkeut District, and representatives of people of all ethnic groups held a joint meeting on the 15th to prepare for the establishment of the Khamkeut District Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and a Unified Country.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 24th – Radio of the Lao Fighting Forces broadcast on the 23rd: According to news from Pakse Province, on November 17, the Phoumi Nosavan-Boun Oum Na Champassak rebel group arrested many monks from Wat Luang temple in Pakse District, Pakse Province, and subjected them to extremely brutal torture.

The Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel group also prohibited monks from chanting scriptures and studying at the temple. These acts of the Phoumi-Boun Oum rebel group, which violate the customs of the Lao people, trample on the people's freedom of rights, and destroy religion, have aroused the anger of the monks in Pakse District and the people of the whole country.

    老挝爱国战线党发言人谴责美国干涉内政
    斥美国利用叛国集团扩大老挝内战
    丰沙里省和甘蒙省群众集会声讨叛国集团罪行
    新华社河内25日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：老挝爱国战线党发言人发表声明，谴责美国国务院发言人怀特最近公开对老挝决定接受苏联、中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国援助一事发出恫吓叫嚣。老挝爱国战线党发言人说，“美国当局的上述叫嚣清楚地供认了美帝国主义仍然顽固地继续威胁要挟老挝合法政府，并进而阻挠老挝遵循符合全老挝人民愿望的和平中立和民族和睦的路线。”
    发言人指出，“在进行公开恫吓的同时，美帝国主义者还增派美国军官和运送武器帮助富米—文翁叛国集团，从而扩大内战和杀害老挝人民。”
    发言人还指出，“现在美帝国主义者正同泰国乃沙立反动派勾结，极力促使老挝叛国集团进攻万象，阴谋颠复梭发那·富马亲王的合法政府，以便成立充当美国走狗的傀儡政府，并以此作为破坏老挝和平中立、民族和睦路线的工具”。
    发言人强调指出，“王国政府和老挝爱国战线党进行谈判和签订公报完全是老挝的内部事务。公报的内容是旨在实现真正的和平中立和民族和睦，这完全符合我们祖国的利益和老挝全国人民真切的要求和愿望。美国当局对老挝合法政府的上述恫吓和要挟态度，是对老挝内部事务的粗暴干涉，是严重地侵犯老挝的独立和主权、蹂躏国际法的行动。”
    新华社河内24日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天发表评论说，当美帝国主义大力支持富米—文翁叛国集团破坏和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的路线，从各方面向王国政府和人民进攻时，王国政府首相富马访问了桑怒，并和老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯发表了会谈的联合公报，这无疑是对敌人的有力打击。评论说，联合公报的发表，说明了政府、人民和爱国爱和平力量的团结一致，说明了以王国政府和老挝爱国战线党为代表的团结力量，坚持维护老挝民族和人民的利益，坚决遵循真正的和平中立道路，坚决反对老挝民族的敌人，反对老挝人民的和平中立和民族和睦路线的敌人。
    评论说，两位亲王发表的联合公报，将会得到老挝各民族、各阶层人民、各宗教和各党派以及一切支持合法政府、反对各民族敌人和主张切实地实现和平中立政策的人们的拥护，同时也将会得到全世界爱好和平和正义的人民的支持。
    评论指出，美帝国主义将会因此而更加疯狂起来，将会进一步施展它的惯用伎俩——施加压力，并向它的走狗提供更多的“援助”，以便继续进行破坏。但是，正如两位亲王在联合公报中指出，决定问题的是老挝人民的力量。老挝人民坚决遵循和平中立和民族和睦路线，坚决支持政府作出的努力，坚决反对美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团的破坏阴谋。最后胜利一定属于老挝人民。
    新华社河内24日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：丰沙里省四个乡的五百多名群众22日举行集会，反对富米·诺萨万叛国集团在琅勃拉邦进行叛乱，和这个集团的爪牙不断迫害丰沙里人民的暴行。
    到会群众一致通过了寄给老挝国王、富马政府、国民议会、老挝爱国战线党中央委员会和争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会的建议书，表示支持政府接受苏联的援助，同中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国建立友好关系。
    桑怒省桑代县芒弗乡二百多人，曾在18日举行集会，表示欢迎王国政府代表团和老挝爱国战线党代表团在谈判中获得的成果。
    新华社河内25日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝甘蒙省堪格县四个乡的各族人民11月10日举行集会，表示拥护富马政府，支持老挝爱国战线党和争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会的政策，反对富米·诺萨万叛国集团进攻万象和北卡定的阴谋，并反对他们强迫青年当兵和把人民赶入变相的集中营的阴谋。
    会上一致通过的一项建议书谴责美帝国主义及其走狗支持富米·诺萨万叛国集团反对王国政府和宪法，破坏和平中立路线，扩大内战的行为。建议书要求王国政府把混进王国军队和各级行政机关的富米叛国集团的爪牙赶出去，尽快地接受苏联的援助，同中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国建立友好关系。
    老挝爱国战线党堪格县委员会、堪格县开明人士和各族人民的代表15日举行联席会议，筹备成立堪格县的争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会。
    新华社河内24日电　寮国战斗部队电台23日广播：据来自巴色省的消息说，11月17日，富米·诺萨万—文翁·纳占巴塞叛乱集团从巴色省巴色县的瓦琅寺庙逮捕了许多僧侣，并对他们进行极其野蛮的拷打。
    富米—文翁叛乱集团还禁止僧侣到寺庙诵经和进行学习。富米—文翁叛乱集团的这些违反老挝人民的风俗习惯，践踏人民的自由权利和破坏宗教的行为，激起了巴色县僧侣和全国人民的愤怒。
