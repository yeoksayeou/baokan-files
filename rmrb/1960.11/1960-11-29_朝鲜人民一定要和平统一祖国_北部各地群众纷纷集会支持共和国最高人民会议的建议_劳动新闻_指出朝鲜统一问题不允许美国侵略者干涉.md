    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 27th: People in various regions of northern Korea have been holding rallies to support the proposal for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland put forward by the Eighth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and expressing their determination to realize this proposal with their practical actions.

    The workers of the Kiyang Tractor Factory, which recently doubled its daily tractor production, held a rally on the 25th. Li Huanjian, the leader of a Chollima work team in one workshop, said at the meeting that the Supreme People's Assembly had put forward the task of relying on the strong economic foundation of the northern half of the Republic to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland, rapidly restore the South Korean economy, and stabilize and improve the living standards of the South Korean people. He said that in the past, our factory was a small factory that could only produce medium-sized agricultural implements, but now it has become a modern factory that can produce 3,000 tractors per year. It can not only complete the mechanization of agriculture in northern Korea but also undertake the mechanization of agriculture in the southern half. We will be able to increase the production of 1,000 tractors before the spring plowing next year and send them to South Korea.

    Kwon Taek-jin, a worker whose hometown is Yecheon in South Korea, said that the division of the motherland can no longer continue. The time has come for the thirty million Korean people to unite and open the road to the reunification of the motherland. In order to promote reunification, North and South Korea must negotiate as soon as possible and conduct economic and cultural exchanges.

    The staff of the Korean Red Cross Hospital also held a rally on the 25th. At the rally, pediatrician Kim Young-hee said that the northern half of the Republic had long implemented a comprehensive free medical system, eliminating infectious diseases such as typhoid, cholera, and smallpox. However, in South Korea, there are six million paragonimiasis patients, one million tuberculosis patients, and more than 200,000 lepers. Because they have no money, they cannot even enter the hospital gates. She said that we must use our medical technology to save our brothers and sisters in the southern half and regard it as a work of great national significance. Kim Jin-ok, Director of Ophthalmology, said that we are ready to establish a branch of the Korean Red Cross Hospital in Seoul at any time, as long as economic and cultural exchanges between North and South Korea are realized, to protect and improve the health of our compatriots in the southern half. We will also help the Seoul Medical University Affiliated Hospital establish automated equipment for treatment rooms and operating rooms.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 27th: The Korean *Rodong Sinmun* published a commentary today, resolutely condemning American imperialism for obstructing the realization of the proposal for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland put forward by the Eighth Session of the Second Supreme People's Assembly of Korea.

    The commentary said that as soon as the historic proposal of the Supreme People's Assembly was published, the American imperialists panicked and, on the one hand, put pressure on its puppets, and on the other hand, mobilized its tool of aggression—the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea"—to clamor for the bankrupt "unification (of Korea) based on UN resolutions." But any conspiracy by the American imperialist aggressors cannot save its increasingly collapsing foundation of colonial rule.

    The commentary said that American imperialism has pushed the people of southern Korea into the abyss of suffering for fifteen years, and today it is desperately obstructing the proposal of the people of the north to save their southern compatriots out of fraternal love. This completely exposes its wolfish nature and proves that American imperialism is the irreconcilable enemy of the Korean people. But no matter how American imperialism struggles, it cannot stop the Korean people's burning desire for the reunification of the motherland, nor can it stop the struggle of the southern people who are finding a way out of life from our proposal and mobilizing to realize it.

    The commentary said that the issue of Korean reunification is an internal affair of the Korean people, and no one or any organization is allowed to interfere. The American imperialist aggressors must not be allowed to talk too much about the Korean issue, and they must immediately get out of southern Korea. No matter how the Korean people unify their country, this has nothing to do with the American imperialist aggressors. The Korean people must realize peaceful reunification with their own strength. We have established a solid material foundation for the struggle for peaceful reunification in the northern half of the Republic, and we will rely on this foundation to save the bankrupt South Korean economy and the people's lives. The day will surely come when thirty million people will live a happy life in one family.

    朝鲜人民一定要和平统一祖国
    北部各地群众纷纷集会支持共和国最高人民会议的建议  “劳动新闻”指出朝鲜统一问题不允许美国侵略者干涉
    新华社平壤27日电　朝鲜北部各地人民纷纷集会支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第二届最高人民会议第八次会议提出的关于和平统一祖国的方案，并表示要以自己的实际行动来实现这一方案。
    最近使拖拉机的日产量一跃提高一倍的岐阳拖拉机厂的职工25日举行集会，一个车间的千里马作业班班长李焕兼在会上说，这次最高人民会议提出了依靠共和国北半部的强有力的经济基础，促进和平统一祖国、迅速恢复南朝鲜经济、安定和提高南朝鲜人民生活的任务。他说，过去我们的工厂是只能生产中型农具的小工厂，现在成了能年产三千台拖拉机的现代化工厂了。它不仅能够完成朝鲜北部农业的机械化，而且也可以担当南半部农业的机械化。我们能够在明年春耕前增产一千台拖拉机并把它送给南朝鲜。
    故乡在南朝鲜醴泉的工人权泽镇说，祖国的分裂再也不能持续下去了。三千万朝鲜人民团结起来打开统一祖国的道路的时候已经到来了。为了促进统一，南北朝鲜必须早日协商，进行经济文化交流。
    朝鲜红十字医院的职工也在25日举行集会，在集会上小儿科医生金英姬说，共和国北半部早已实行了全面的免费医疗制，消灭了伤寒、霍乱、天花等传染病。但是，南朝鲜有六百万肺吸虫病人、一百万结核病人、二十多万麻疯病人。他们由于没有钱，连医院门口都进不去。她说，我们要用我们的医疗技术来拯救南半部的兄弟姐妹，并把它当作是具有巨大的民族意义的工作。眼科主任金真玉说，我们已经作好了准备，只要实现南北朝鲜的经济文化交流，什么时候都可以在汉城建立朝鲜红十字医院的分院，保护和增进南半部同胞的健康。我们还要帮助汉城医科大学附属医院建立治疗室和手术室的自动设备。
    新华社平壤27日电　朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天发表评论，坚决谴责美帝国主义阻挠实现朝鲜第二届最高人民会议第八次会议提出的关于和平统一祖国的建议。
    评论说，这次最高人民会议的历史性的建议一发表，美帝国主义者就惊慌失措地一方面对它的傀儡施加压力，一方面动员它的侵略工具——“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”，叫嚷早已破了产的什么“根据联合国决议统一（朝鲜）”。但是美帝国主义侵略者的任何阴谋也决不能挽救它那日益崩溃的殖民统治基础。
    评论说，美帝国主义十五年来把朝鲜南部人民推进了苦难的深渊，今天又拼命地阻挠北部人民为拯救南部同胞而出自同胞友爱的建议，这完全暴露了它的狼性，证明了美帝国主义是朝鲜人民的不共戴天的敌人。但是，不管美帝国主义怎样挣扎，也阻挡不了朝鲜人民对统一祖国的火热的愿望，也阻挡不了从我们的这次建议中寻找生活出路、并为其实现而动员起来的南部人民的斗争。
    评论说，朝鲜的统一问题，是朝鲜人民的内政问题，是不容任何人、任何机构进行干涉的。不准美帝国主义侵略者对朝鲜问题多嘴多舌，它必须立即从朝鲜南部滚出去。不管朝鲜人民怎样统一自己的国家，这是和美帝国主义侵略者根本不相干的事情。朝鲜人民一定要以自己的力量来实现和平统一。我们在共和国的北半部建立了争取和平统一的坚固的物质基础，我们将依靠这个基础来挽救破了产的南朝鲜的经济和人民生活，三千万人民在一个家庭里过幸福生活的日子必将到来。
