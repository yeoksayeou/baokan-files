    A Vanguard on the Livestock Front
    ——An Interview with Filippov, a Pig-Raising Expert from Moscow Oblast
    By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang
    The millions of workers on the livestock front in the Soviet Union are exploring new potential in all aspects and devising new methods to improve the level of livestock production, all to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Whether it's milkmaids in Russia or pig farmers in Ukraine, sheep herders on the steppes of Kazakhstan or poultry breeders on the Baltic coast, they are all doing their best to complete a common task—completing the Seven-Year Plan for livestock production ahead of schedule.
    Recently, livestock workers in many districts and regions of the Soviet Union have put forward competitive pledges to complete the Seven-Year Plan two or three years ahead of schedule. As the labor competition unfolds, new heroic figures continue to emerge. They use their wisdom to create new working methods, save labor, and reduce arduous work, thereby greatly improving labor productivity.
    At the beginning of this year, the story of the competition among three pig-raising heroes in the Soviet Union spread widely across the country. These three heroes are Chichi from Ukraine, Bartulis from Latvia, and Peresuvko from Omsk Oblast in Siberia. The guarantee they put forward this year is to raise one thousand to three thousand pigs each.
    The competition of these three advanced pig farmers has been enthusiastically responded to in other regions, and the followers of the three heroes are increasing day by day. Now, almost everywhere in the Soviet Union has its own "Chichi," and they are fighting for increased meat production under different conditions.
    In the Lyuberetsky District of Moscow Oblast, there is a "Moscow Soviet" state-owned farm, a specialized farm with more than 1,000 hectares of land. Every day, more than a dozen trucks transport tons of vegetables and milk to Moscow from here. There is a tractor driver named Filippov on the farm. This spring, he learned about the heroic deeds of Chichi, a pig farmer from Ukraine, from the newspaper. Chichi's advanced pig-raising method immediately attracted his attention: one person raises thousands of pigs, selling tens of thousands of kilograms of meat to the state in a year. This had never happened before. The question Filippov immediately wanted to understand was: where exactly is the secret of this advanced working method?
    From that day on, Filippov, a thirty-three-year-old Communist Party member, began to study Chichi's advanced pig-raising method. While studying, he considered the pig-raising situation of his own farm. At that time, each pig farmer on the "Moscow Soviet" farm could only raise forty or fifty pigs, and they still felt quite strained. After comparing the two situations, Filippov found that one of the main "secrets" of Chichi's advanced pig-raising method was the elimination of pig pens commonly used in pig raising, and the implementation of simple mechanization in feeding and cleaning. After reaching this conclusion, Filippov thought that if the pig pens in the farm's two pig houses were removed, two or three thousand pigs could be raised at the same time. In this way, raising three batches a year would be five or six thousand. With some simple feeding tools, plus mechanical cleaning of the pig houses, it would not be a problem for one person to raise four or five thousand pigs a year.
    After Filippov's idea matured, he discussed it with his family and colleagues, but unexpectedly, many people disagreed. First of all, his mother. When he told his mother that he wanted to become a pig farmer and planned to raise four or five thousand pigs a year, his mother said: "Are you crazy?! One person raising four or five thousand pigs?! That's nonsense. I thought it was a lot when I watched fifty pigs back then! Stop daydreaming and just drive your tractor!"
    When some people on the farm heard about Filippov's idea, some said that if pigs were raised without pens, they would fight each other, and big pigs would bite small pigs to death; some said that if pigs were raised in large groups, if one pig got sick, the herd would be infected; others said that pigs like to be dirty, and they wouldn't get used to raising them without pens using peat bedding, and they might even "catch a cold"...
    But all of this did not shake Filippov's idea. After he had completely thought out his plan, he explained his plan to the Party Committee Secretary of the farm and asked the organization to send him to work as a pig farmer. Party Committee Secretary Samokhvalov and Farm Director Budkin carefully studied with Filippov and agreed to his plan and decided to give it strong support.
    That's how tractor driver Filippov became a pig farmer.
    After Filippov became a pig farmer, the first thing he did was to renovate the pig houses. He removed all the pig pens in the two pig houses and carried out small-scale repairs with the help of the farm administration. In this way, the originally crowded two pig houses became spacious and clean. When we visited Filippov, there were more than two thousand piglets in his two pig houses.
    There are two kinds of feed for feeding pigs here. One is food scraps from canteens and residences in Moscow, and the other is silage feed. After mixing the two kinds of feed evenly, they are placed in a self-made trough on the farm. There is a horizontally placed cylinder on the trough, and each cylinder can hold several hundred kilograms of feed. One trough can accommodate sixteen pigs to eat. After the food is finished, it can flow down automatically. There are also small automatic water dispensers near the pig house, where piglets can go to drink water.
    Filippov told us that he feeds the piglets three times a day. Apart from that, he cleans the pig houses. The peat that is laid in the pig houses is changed every ten days. Peat has a strong insulation force, and it can also absorb nitrogen from the excrement. Therefore, after using peat bedding, the air in the pig house is cleaner than before. Using peat bedding can also preserve pig manure well. Every ton of peat can be turned into three tons of good fertilizer after being placed in the pig house for ten days, which is very much needed for the farm. The work of cleaning the pig house is very simple. When the peat needs to be replaced, just drive a bulldozer to push out the old peat and spread the new peat. There are no pig pens in the pig house, and the bulldozer can be driven around.
    After Filippov used the new pig-raising method, the average daily weight gain per pig in the first month for two thousand pigs was 460 grams, which was slightly lower than the level of other pig farmers on the farm. But in the second month, it reached 520 grams, surpassing other pig farmers, and because Filippov replaced twenty people by himself, the cost was greatly reduced.
    In late September, Filippov also sold 762 live pigs to the state, with a total weight of 78,000 kilograms. If calculated from the beginning of the year, he has already sold nearly five thousand pigs, with an average weight of 100 kilograms per pig. Filippov's first year of pig raising has achieved initial success.
    Filippov's working method has been widely spread in Moscow Oblast. In the Russian Pavilion of the All-Union Exhibition of Achievements in National Economy, we saw materials and photos introducing Filippov's working method. Many visitors come here every day to study Filippov's work experience in detail.
    When we asked Filippov about his plan for next year, he explained that the primary task for next year is to further reduce costs. The Party Committee Secretary of the "Moscow Soviet" state-owned farm also told us that there is already a group of Filippov's followers on the farm. Tractor driver Martinov has requested the Party Committee to allow him to learn Filippov's pig-raising method. Two female Communist Youth League members, Maksimova and Zakina, have also made the same request. The "Moscow Soviet" state-owned farm is preparing to summarize Filippov's work experience and then promote this new method more widely. (Attached picture)

    畜牧业战线上的尖兵
    ——访莫斯科州的养猪能手菲力波夫
    本报记者　崔永昌
    苏联千千万万个畜牧业战线的劳动者，为了提前完成七年计划，正从各方面发掘新的潜力，想出新办法来提高畜牧业的生产水平。不管是俄罗斯的挤奶员还是乌克兰的养猪员，也不管是哈萨克斯坦草原的牧羊工还是波罗的海边上的家禽饲养员，他们都在尽自己的全部力量完成着一项共同的事业——提前完成畜牧业生产的七年计划。
    最近以来，苏联许多区和许多州的畜牧业工作者都提出了提前两三年完成七年计划的竞赛保证。随着劳动竞赛的展开，新的英雄人物不断出现，他们用自己的智慧创造了新的工作法，节省了劳动力，减轻了繁重的劳动，因而使劳动生产率大大提高起来。
    今年年初，苏联三位养猪英雄竞赛的佳话在全国普遍传开，这三位英雄人物便是乌克兰的契奇，拉脱维亚的巴尔图利斯和西伯利亚鄂木斯克州的佩列斯符科。他们三人今年提出的保证是每人饲养一千到三千头猪。
    这三位先进养猪员的竞赛在其他地区也得到了热烈响应，三个英雄的追随者也一天天增加，现在在全苏各地差不多都有了自己的“契奇”，他们在不同的条件下为增产肉类而进行着斗争。
    莫斯科州的留别列茨区有一个“莫斯科苏维埃”国营农场，这是一个拥有一千多公顷土地的专业化农场，每天从这里有十几辆载重汽车把成吨的蔬菜和牛奶运到莫斯科去。农场里有一位名叫菲力波夫的拖拉机手，今年春天他从报纸上知道了乌克兰养猪员契奇的英雄事迹，契奇的先进养猪法立即引起了他的注意：一个人饲养上千头猪，一年内向国家交售几万公斤肉，这是以前根本没有过的事。菲力波夫马上想了解的问题是：这种先进工作法的秘密到底在什么地方？
    从这一天开始，这位三十三岁的共产党员菲力波夫就开始研究契奇的先进养猪法。他一边研究，一边考虑自己农场的养猪情况。这时在“莫斯科苏维埃”农场每个养猪员只能饲养四五十头猪，并且还感到相当吃力，菲力波夫把两种情况对比了以后，发现齐日的先进养猪法的主要“秘密”之一便是取消了养猪所惯用的猪栏，同时在喂食和打扫方面实行了简单的机械化。得出这个结论以后，菲力波夫就想，如果把农场的两个养猪房中的猪栏拆掉，那么同时可以养两三千头猪，这样，一年养三批就是五六千头，用一些喂食的简单工具，加上用机械打扫猪房，这样一个人一年饲养四五千头猪不成问题。
    菲力波夫这个想法成熟以后，他便同自己家里的人、同一起工作的同志们商量，但是出乎意外的是许多人都不同意。首先是他的母亲，当他告诉他母亲他想当养猪员，并且计划一年饲养四五千头猪时，他母亲说：“你发疯了？！一个人养四五千头猪？！简直是胡说，我当年一个人看五十头猪就算很多的了！别胡思乱想了，还是开你的拖拉机吧！”
    农场中有些人听到菲力波夫的想法以后，有的说实行无栏养猪法，猪会彼此打架，大猪会把小猪咬死；有的说，大群养猪，一头猪生病，猪群会受传染；还有的说，猪是爱脏的，无栏养猪法用泥炭垫圈，猪一定不习惯，说不定还要“伤风感冒”……
    但是这一切都没有动摇菲力波夫的想法，当他把自己的计划彻底想好以后，他就向农场党委书记说明了自己的计划，并且要求组织上派他去作养猪员。党委书记萨莫赫瓦洛夫，农场场长布得金同菲力波夫仔细研究了以后，同意了他的计划，并且决定给以大力支持。
    就是这样，拖拉机手菲力波夫当上了养猪员。
    菲力波夫作了养猪员以后，第一件事就是改建猪房，他把两个养猪房中的猪栏全部拆掉，并且在农场行政帮助下进行了小规模的补建。这样，原来拥挤的两个养猪房变得宽敞而清洁起来。当我们访问菲力波夫时，在他的两个养猪房里一共有二千多头仔猪。
    这里喂猪的饲料是两种，一种是莫斯科市各食堂和住宅的食物残渣，另一种是青贮饲料。两种饲料拌匀以后放在农场自制的一种食槽当中，食槽上面有一个横放圆筒，每个圆筒中可以放几百斤饲料，一个食槽可以容纳十六头猪吃食，食物吃完以后可以自动流下来。在养猪房附近还有小型的自动饮水器，仔猪可以到那里饮水。
    菲力波夫告诉我们说，他每天给仔猪喂三次食，除此以外便是打扫猪房。养猪房中垫的泥炭十天换一次，泥炭的保温力很强，另外还可以吸收粪尿中的氮气，所以用泥炭垫圈以后养猪房中的空气比以前清洁了。用泥炭垫圈还可以很好地保存猪肥，每一吨泥炭在养猪房中放上十天以后就可以变成三吨很好的肥料，这对于农场是非常需要的。打扫养猪房的工作非常简单，泥炭需要更换时，只要开上推土机把旧泥炭推出去，把新泥炭铺上就可以了，养猪房中没有猪栏，推土机可以开来开去。
    菲力波夫使用了新的养猪法以后，两千头猪第一个月平均每头每天的上膘量是四百六十克，比农场其他养猪员的水平稍低一些。但是在第二个月便达到了五百二十克的水平，赶过了其他养猪员，而且由于菲力波夫一人代替了二十个人，所以成本也大大降低。
    9月下旬菲力波夫又向国家交售了七百六十二头生猪，总重量达到七万八千公斤。如果从年初算起，他已经交售了将近五千头猪，每头猪的平均重量是一百公斤。菲力波夫第一年的养猪工作取得了初步胜利。
    菲力波夫的工作法在莫斯科州已经广泛传开，在全苏国民经济成绩展览会的俄罗斯馆里，我们看到了介绍菲力波夫工作法的材料和照片，这里每天都有许多参观者详细研究菲力波夫的工作经验。
    当我们问菲力波夫明年的计划时，他说明年的首要任务是进一步降低成本。“莫斯科苏维埃”国营农场党委书记还告诉我们说，目前在农场中已经有了一批菲力波夫的追随者，拖拉机手马尔蒂诺夫向党委提出要求允许他学习菲力波夫工作法养猪，两个女共青团员马克西莫娃和扎金娜也提出了同样要求。“莫斯科苏维埃”国营农场准备总结菲力波夫的工作经验以后，把这项新的方法更广泛地推广开来。（附图片）
