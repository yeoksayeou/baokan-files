    Condolences for Félix-Roland Moumié
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    Félix-Roland Moumié, the outstanding leader of the Cameroonian National Liberation Movement and chairman of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, was assassinated by imperialism in Geneva on November 3. Upon hearing this terrible news, the Chinese people, like all righteous people in the world, feel boundless anger at this despicable crime of imperialism and express our deepest condolences for the death of Félix-Roland Moumié.
    Moumié's assassination is a frenzied counterattack by the imperialists against the Cameroonian people's national liberation movement. This fact once again proves the brutal and ugly nature of imperialism and colonialism. Although, as a result of the Cameroonian people's struggle, the French colonialists were forced to agree to Cameroon declaring its independence on January 1 this year, they still maintain colonial troops in Cameroon. Their aerial bandits continue to bomb peaceful villages and towns in Cameroon, and their security police and secret agents continue to openly massacre patriotic Cameroonians. All the hypocritical performances of the imperialists cannot conceal their deep-seated hatred for the revolutionary struggles of the colonial peoples. In order to extinguish the flames of the national liberation movements of colonial peoples, imperialism and colonialism will stop at nothing. As the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon pointed out in its statement on the assassination of Moumié on November 7, this fact once again "demonstrates the evil determination of the imperialists to use any means to permanently carry out colonial exploitation of our country and people."
    Moumié's assassination demonstrates the death throes of the reactionary forces of imperialism in Cameroon. More than four years ago, under the leadership of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, the Cameroonian people were forced to take up arms and launch a heroic armed struggle against the French colonialists. Over these four years, the consciousness of the Cameroonian people has been unprecedentedly raised, and the armed forces of the Cameroonian people have grown from several hundred to tens of thousands. The scope of the armed struggle has expanded to one-third of the country. This is the decisive force that forced the French colonialists to recognize Cameroon's independence. Although French imperialism still maintains more than 80,000 colonial troops in this African country with a population of just over four million, and also has the strong support of the ferocious US imperialism (the United States supplies 50% of the weapons for the French colonial troops in Cameroon), the French colonial troops in Cameroon are increasingly mired in a predicament of being exhausted and beaten everywhere, unable to extricate themselves. Now, the colonialists are even resorting to despicable and shameless assassination tactics. They believe that as long as Moumié is killed, the national revolution in Cameroon will suffer a setback. However, contrary to the subjective wishes of imperialism, their crimes will not prevent the Cameroonian people from advancing along the road to victory in the national liberation struggle, but will only further deepen the Cameroonian people's hatred of imperialism and inspire their indestructible will to oppose imperialism and colonialism.
    Moumié dedicated his life to the national liberation cause of the Cameroonian and the African people. He was an outstanding African statesman who grew up in the heroic struggle of the African people to oppose imperialism and colonialism. Moumié deeply understood that to win national independence, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism and not harbor any illusions about imperialism. At the Second All-African People's Conference held in January this year, he warned the African people that while rejoicing in their irresistible progress, they should be doubly vigilant against the various conspiracies being intensified by the imperialists. He particularly reminded the Cameroonian people and the people of all African countries to be vigilant against the serious threat posed by US imperialism to the African national independence movement, and powerfully exposed US imperialism as the most dangerous and ferocious enemy of the Cameroonian and African people. He said, "Despite making some high-sounding statements, the United States is the ringleader of neo-colonialism. The United States uses anti-communism as a cloak to cover up its economic plunder and bellicosity, and it is actively supporting the French imperialists' brutal war against the Cameroonian national movement." These last words of Moumié have great practical significance for the national liberation cause of the African people. In its statement, the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon called on the people to transform grief into strength and vowed to carry the national revolution through to the end: "The revolution continues. Faithful to the struggle in which Niobé, Moumié, and many such patriots sacrificed themselves, it will guide the actions of the Cameroonian people until final victory." This is a powerful response from the Cameroonian people to the atrocities of Franco-American imperialism.

    哀悼费利克斯·穆米埃
    本报评论员
    喀麦隆民族解放运动的杰出领袖、喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·穆米埃，11月3日在日内瓦被帝国主义所暗害。噩耗传来，中国人民和全世界一切正直的人民一样，对于帝国主义的这种卑鄙的罪行感到无比的愤怒，对于费利克斯·穆米埃的逝世表示深切的哀悼。
    穆米埃的被害，是帝国主义者对喀麦隆人民的民族解放运动的一次疯狂的反扑。这个事实再一次证明了帝国主义和殖民者的残暴和丑恶的本性。尽管由于喀麦隆人民斗争的结果，法国殖民者被迫同意喀麦隆在今年1月1日宣布了独立，但它仍然在喀麦隆保持着殖民军队。它的空中强盗仍然轰炸着喀麦隆的和平的村镇，它的宪警特务仍然公开屠杀着喀麦隆的爱国人民。帝国主义者的一切伪善的表演，都不能掩盖住它们对于殖民地人民革命斗争的刻骨的仇恨。为了扑灭殖民地人民的民族解放运动的火焰，帝国主义和殖民者是无所不用其极的。正如11月7日喀麦隆人民联盟在就穆米埃被害事件发表的声明中所指出的，这个事实又一次“表明了帝国主义者不择手段，为永久地对我们国家和人民进行殖民剥削的罪恶决心”。
    穆米埃的被害，表现了帝国主义反动力量在喀麦隆的垂死挣扎。四年多以前，喀麦隆人民在喀麦隆人民联盟的领导下被迫拿起武器，向法国殖民者展开了英勇的武装斗争。在这四年多的过程中，喀麦隆人民的觉悟空前地提高了，喀麦隆人民的武装力量已从几百人发展成为几万人。武装斗争的范围已经扩大到了全国三分之一的地区。这是迫使法国殖民者不得不承认喀麦隆独立的决定性的力量。法国帝国主义虽然在这个只有四百多万人口的非洲国家迄今仍保持着八万以上的殖民军队，并且还有着凶恶的美帝国主义的有力支持（美国供给法国在喀麦隆的殖民军队武器的50％），但法国殖民军队在喀麦隆却日益陷入疲于奔命、到处挨打的困境而不能自拔。现在，殖民者甚至乞灵于卑鄙无耻的暗害手段。它们以为只要穆米埃被杀害了，喀麦隆的民族革命就会遭到挫折。但是，同帝国主义的主观愿望相反，它们的罪行决不能阻止喀麦隆人民沿着民族解放斗争胜利的道路前进，而只能进一步加深喀麦隆人民对帝国主义的仇恨，激发他们反对帝国主义和殖民主义的不可摧毁的意志。
    穆米埃把自己的一生献给了喀麦隆人民和非洲人民的民族解放事业。他是在非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的英勇斗争中成长起来的非洲杰出的政治家。穆米埃深深懂得，要争取民族独立就必须同帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，不能对帝国主义抱任何幻想。他在今年1月举行的第二届全非人民大会上曾经告诫非洲人民在对自己的势不可当的进展感到欢欣鼓舞的同时，应当对帝国主义者加紧进行的各种阴谋活动加倍警惕。他特别提醒喀麦隆人民和非洲各国人民警惕美帝国主义对非洲民族独立运动的严重威胁，有力地揭露了美帝国主义是喀麦隆人民和非洲人民的最危险最凶恶的敌人。他说，“美国尽管冠冕堂皇发表一些声明，但是他们是新殖民主义的头子。美国用反共的外衣掩盖它的经济掠夺和好战性，它正在积极支持法帝国主义者对喀麦隆民族运动所进行的残酷战争。”穆米埃的这些遗言对于非洲人民的民族解放事业具有重大的现实意义。喀麦隆人民联盟在自己的声明中号召人民化悲痛为力量，誓将民族革命进行到底：“革命在继续中。它忠实于尼奥比、穆米埃和许多这样的爱国者在其中牺牲了的斗争，将指导喀麦隆人民的行动，直到最后胜利”。这就是喀麦隆人民对于法—美帝国主义暴行的一个有力的回答。
