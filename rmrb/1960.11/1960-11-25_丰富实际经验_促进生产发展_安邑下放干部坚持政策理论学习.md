Enrich Practical Experience and Promote Production Development
An'yi Township's Cadres Stationed in Lower Levels Persist in Policy and Theoretical Study

(Our dispatch) Since An'yi Commune in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, implemented the "two-five system" leadership method, cadres who have gone to the front lines have not only frequently participated in production and led production, but also persisted in studying theory and policy. This has enriched their practical experience, improved their theoretical and policy understanding, and promoted the development of production.

Since the implementation of the "two-five system" leadership method, An'yi Commune has had 181 county, commune, and district cadres stationed at the front lines of production. The vast majority of them have high work enthusiasm and great energy, and have made significant achievements. However, some cadres have low policy understanding and, although they have helped the masses with many ideas, they cannot solve key problems well. Some cadres, due to a lack of grassroots work experience, are often overwhelmed by affairs and cannot consistently persist in their studies. The commune Party committee analyzed this situation and believed that in addition to improving their leadership skills through practical training, it was also necessary to strengthen their theoretical and policy study. To achieve this, the commune Party committee established a central study group and built a "school, class, group" one-stop study network throughout the commune: the commune established a Red and Expert School, the management districts set up classes respectively, and the villages formed study groups. In addition, a lecture group and a teaching and research office were established to be responsible for lecturing and tutoring. Furthermore, the commune Party committee also stipulated that study time should not be arbitrarily occupied; in case of special circumstances, it must be made up later. In this way, the cadres' study has gradually become regular and systematic.

In leading the study process, the commune Party committee has always implemented the principle of studying and applying simultaneously, combining study with application, discussing the reality from the abstract, and combining the abstract with the real. Many young cadres lacked a mass viewpoint, a labor viewpoint, and a class analysis viewpoint in their work. After the commune organized them to study the People's Daily editorial "Participate in Production and Lead Production" and Chairman Mao's article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," they truly shed their airs and ate, lived, labored, and consulted with the commune members. After studying the socialist part of political economics, many cadres realized that the rational use of labor and the improvement of labor efficiency were the key issues in developing agricultural production. They actively helped the production teams formulate labor management methods. Du Huai'ren, who worked in the Banpo Management District, after studying, visited every household to find out the specialties and physical strength of each laborer, reorganized the labor organization, and rationally arranged the farm work, thereby solving the contradiction of wide land, weak animal power, many farm works, and a shortage of labor, ensuring that the entire team's 1,800 mu of wheat completed the sowing task on time and with quality. After studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice," many cadres consciously combined study with writing, solid work with serious experience summarization. Most cadres not only summarized their own experiences as "advisors" but also helped grassroots cadres systematize unsystematic perceptual knowledge.

The cadres stationed at the front lines of An'yi Commune not only studied well and applied well themselves but also paid attention to helping the masses study theory and policy. The commune Party committee proposed that the cadres stationed at the front lines should not only be good commanders and fighters but also good study tutors. Currently, all 181 cadres on the front lines of the commune serve as theoretical teachers and tutors. They lecture to commune members at least twice a month. Through lecturing and tutoring, the theoretical and policy understanding of grassroots cadres and commune members has been effectively improved, and the ideological consciousness of the masses has been raised. Many masses reflected: "Studying theory opens the mind, clarifies the direction, and increases enthusiasm."

### 丰富实际经验　促进生产发展  安邑下放干部坚持政策理论学习

    丰富实际经验　促进生产发展
    安邑下放干部坚持政策理论学习
    本报讯　山西省运城县安邑公社推行“二五制”领导方法以来，深入第一线的干部除了经常参加生产、领导生产外，还坚持了理论政策的学习，既丰富了实际经验，又提高了理论政策水平，促进了生产的发展。
    安邑公社自推行“二五制”领导方法以来，下放到生产第一线的县、社、区干部，共有一百八十一人。其中绝大部分劳动热情高，工作劲头大，作出了显著成绩。但也有一些干部由于政策水平低，虽然也帮助群众出了不少主意，却不能很好解决关键问题。有些干部则由于缺乏基层工作经验，往往被事务缠身，学习不能经常坚持。公社党委分析了这一情况，认为除了在实际锻炼中提高他们的领导水平以外，还必须加强理论政策学习。为了做到这一点，公社党委成立了中心学习组，并在全公社建立了“校、班、组”一条龙的学习网：公社建立红专学校，管理区分别设班，以村组成学习小组。同时还设立了讲师团和教研室，负责讲课和辅导。此外，公社党委还作出规定，学习时间不得随意占用；如有特殊情况，以后一定补足。这样，干部的学习就逐步做到了经常化、制度化。
    公社党委在领导学习过程中，始终贯彻了边学边用，学用结合，以虚论实，虚实并举的方针。许多青年干部，在工作中缺乏群众观点、劳动观点和阶级分析的观点，公社组织他们学习了人民日报“参加生产、领导生产”的社论、毛主席《关于中国社会各阶级的分析》的文章以后，使他们真正放下架子，和社员同吃，同住，同劳动、同商量。许多干部在学习了政治经济学社会主义部分以后，都认识到：合理使用劳力，提高劳动效率，是发展农业生产的关键问题，就积极帮助生产队，制定了劳力管理办法。在半坡管理区工作的杜怀仁，经过学习以后，挨门逐户访问，摸清了每个劳力的特长和体力情况，整顿了劳动组织，合理安排了农活，从而解决了土地广、畜力弱、农活多、劳力少的矛盾，保证了全队一千八百亩小麦按质、按时完成了下种任务。许多干部学习了毛主席的《实践论》以后，都自觉地把学习与写作、踏实工作与认真总结经验结合在一起。多数干部不仅总结了自己“当参谋”的经验，还帮助基层干部把不系统的感性知识，加以条理化，系统化。
    安邑公社深入第一线的干部，不仅自己学习的好，用的好，而且还注意帮助群众学习理论政策。公社党委提出：深入第一线的干部，不仅要当好指挥员、战斗员，而且要当好学习辅导员。目前全公社在第一线的一百八十一名干部，都分别兼任了理论教员和辅导员。他们每月至少给社员讲课两次。通过讲课和辅导，有效地提高了基层干部和社员的理论政策水平，提高了群众的思想觉悟。许多群众反映：“学理论开心窍，方向明，干劲高”。
