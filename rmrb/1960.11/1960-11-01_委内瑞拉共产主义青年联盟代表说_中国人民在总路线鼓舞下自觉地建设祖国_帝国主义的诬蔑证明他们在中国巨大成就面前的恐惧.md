The Venezuelan Communist Youth League representatives, Jesús Antonio Valedón and Ramón Canales, who are currently visiting China, recently spoke enthusiastically to Xinhua News Agency reporters about their impressions during their visit to China. They said they were deeply impressed by the Chinese Communist Party's consistently correct leadership in guiding the Chinese people to victory in various revolutionary periods.

Referring to their visit to the People's Communes, Canales said: "Contrary to the slander of the imperialists, we personally saw there that the people are consciously building their own country, and both the old and the young are very happy." Valedón also pointed out: "The imperialists' rumors and slander against China only prove their fear in the face of China's great achievements, and this kind of slander now has no market."

Valedón pointed out that the Chinese People's Communes are the creation of the broad masses of Chinese peasants under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. He said that the Chinese Communist Party had victoriously led the Chinese peasants in their struggle against landlords and the distribution of land, and then gradually established mutual aid teams, elementary and advanced cooperatives, and further developed into People's Communes. This path of continuous revolutionary development is correct.

He said that during their visits to industrial cities such as Anshan and Wuhan, they saw that, inspired by the Chinese Communist Party's general line for socialist construction, the workers were working enthusiastically, and the face of both large and small enterprises was changing rapidly in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. China's coal production has long exceeded that of Britain. "All this proves that China, with the leadership of a great party and a great people, will be able to catch up with and surpass any imperialist country in industrial production."

Referring to their visits to some schools, Valedón said: "China's education has also made great leaps forward and continues to leap forward. Unlike capitalist countries, Chinese schools are open to children of workers and peasants, and the number of students, school facilities, and teaching content are incomparable to those before liberation." The guests also enthusiastically praised our country's policy of combining education with productive labor. He said: "These achievements of the Chinese people are not only for the Chinese people themselves, but also a support for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, encouraging them to fight against imperialism."

    委内瑞拉共产主义青年联盟代表说
    中国人民在总路线鼓舞下自觉地建设祖国
    帝国主义的诬蔑证明他们在中国巨大成就面前的恐惧
    正在我国访问的委内瑞拉共产主义青年联盟代表赫苏斯·安东尼奥·瓦来顿和拉蒙·坎拉来斯最近向新华社记者热情地谈到他们在中国访问期间的感想。他们说，他们对中国共产党一贯正确地领导中国人民在各个革命时期取得胜利，有着深刻的印象。
    谈到在人民公社的访问时，坎拉来斯说：“和帝国主义者的种种诬蔑相反，我们在那里亲眼看到人民都在自觉地建设着自己的国家，无论老人、小孩都非常欢乐。瓦来顿同时指出：“帝国主义对中国的造谣诬蔑不过证明他们在中国巨大成就面前的恐惧，而这种诬蔑现在已经没有市场了。”
    瓦来顿指出，中国的人民公社是中国广大农民在中国共产党领导下的创造。他说，中国共产党曾经胜利地领导中国农民进行反对地主、分配土地的斗争，以后又逐步建立了互助组、初级和高级合作社和进一步发展到人民公社，这种不断革命的发展道路是正确的。
    他说，他们在鞍山、武汉等工业城市访问时看到，在中国共产党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，工人都在热情地工作着，无论大型或小型企业的面貌都在技术革新和技术革命运动中急遽地变化。中国的煤产量早就已经超过英国，“这一切证明：有着一个伟大的党的领导和伟大人民的中国，在工业生产上将能够赶上和超过任何帝国主义国家。”
    谈到在一些学校的访问时，瓦来顿说：“中国的教育事业也有了很大的跃进，并继续在跃进着。和资本主义国家不同，中国的学校是向工农子弟开放的，无论学生人数、学校设备和教学内容和解放以前都无法比拟。”客人并热情地赞扬我国教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。他说：“中国人民的这些成就不仅是中国人民自己的，它对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民也是一种支持，鼓舞着他们为反对帝国主义而斗争。”
