In my position

　　Fighting with Heaven is Boundless Joy

　　Dong Dingrong, Captain of the Bayi Production Team, Taiping People's Commune, Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, and Special Researcher of the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute of the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences

　　In those areas with poor soil, prone to flooding and drought, and chronic grain shortages, is it really possible to quickly transform them into fertile soil, free from flooding and drought, and change from grain shortage to grain surplus?

　　In the first few years after liberation, this question kept turning over in my mind. At that time, we poor and lower-middle peasants had politically turned ourselves around and become masters of the country; economically, we had also been allocated land, but we still had to rely on the heavens for our food. I thought: we peasants, under the leadership of the Party, are infinitely powerful, can't we conquer nature and produce more grain? Yes, we certainly can!

　　Our production team is located on the south bank of the Fuchun River, with beautiful scenery, but the land is not good. The more than 500 mu of sandy land along the river is a "leaky tank," with loose soil that does not easily retain water, and every time the river rises, it brings some sand, making this sandy area higher and higher, and extremely prone to drought. The other 300 mu of paddy fields, although a little further from the riverbank, are low-lying and prone to flooding. These two plots of land, year after year, were "flooded after three and a half points of rain, and busy fighting drought before the rain hat was dry," exhausting us, but still resulting in grain shortages.

　　In 1956, when the advanced cooperative was established, we had more people and more strength, so we began to declare war on nature: building flood control dikes to prevent flooding, and buying water pumps to fight drought. With the joint efforts of the cooperatives along the river, we not only quickly achieved this, but also built a reservoir. Since then, we have changed from a grain-deficient area to a grain-surplus area.

　　It is not just by relying on flood control dikes, water pumps, and reservoirs that we can have a bumper harvest and increased production every year. That is only the first step in fighting against nature, the beginning of our determined efforts to become stronger; we want to make the land yield more grain. So, we then changed from one crop a year to two crops a year. The main measures were to change dry land into paddy fields, and single-season rice into double-season rice.

　　But because we lacked experience, we didn't do well at first. One season of early rice, the high yield was more than 500 jin, and the low yield was only more than 200 jin, which was ridiculed by the well-to-do middle peasants: "Having one season, you want two; after becoming an emperor, you want to ascend to heaven." I am a person who likes to get to the bottom of things. At this time, a thought kept turning over in my mind: why are the yields so different? What is the relationship between it and variety, season, fertilizer, etc.? There are many mysteries in agricultural production, and I haven't solved many in half my life, why not rely on the collective? The branch decided to organize an agricultural science research group, and recommended branch secretary Wang Wenhai as the leader, and I was the deputy leader. At first, there were only a few people, but it didn't matter, we expanded slowly.

　　We adopted the method of one learning (going to other places to learn the experience of growing double-season rice), two finding (finding high-yield experience, finding the reasons for low yield), and three checking (checking fields, checking yields, checking ideology), and summarized field by field, finally finding the five key points for growing good double-season rice: seizing the season, cultivating strong seedlings, accumulating a lot of fertilizer, close planting, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases.

　　Our grain yield per mu has increased from the "old three hundred jin" before 1956 to more than 500 jin in 1956, then to 1,000 jin in 1958, and to 1,230 jin in 1959. Some commune members were complacent and said: "The sky is boundless, the land has boundaries, it's almost enough." But I was very doubtful: "Has production reached its peak?" Flipping through my production notebook, which the commune members call the "encyclopedia," according to the planting density, soil properties, and yield records over the years, I walked from Jiangtian field to Baitat field, and crossed the river to Huangtian field, comparing and studying field by field, why is the yield of Jiangtian field the highest with the same cultivation? Why is the yield of "Taihu Qing" rice seeds sown in the same field higher than that of "Yangjian Xian" rice seeds? It can be seen that there is great potential for increasing production.

　　After discussing with Comrade Wang Wenhai, the branch secretary, we decided to start with transforming backward fields and promoting improved varieties to achieve overall production increase. As a result, the average yield per mu of early rice this year increased by another 58% compared with last year.

　　Usually, I pay special attention to the experimental work of raising seedlings, preventing rotten seedlings, and cultivating strong seedlings. As the saying goes, "Good seedlings are half the battle," which is absolutely true. This requires mastering the climate. For this reason, we have established a weather station, listening to the radio on the one hand, and summarizing the experience of the old farmers on the other hand, acting according to the weather. After sowing, we eat in the fields and sleep in the fields. During the vernal equinox, the weather is changeable, "one day shirtless, three days in cotton-padded clothes." Whenever there is a cold wave, we quickly get up and cover the seedlings with ashes. Once, when I passed Qingsha beach, I found that this sandy area was very dry, and touching it with my hand, it was indeed hotter than other mud. I thought: can we use clear sand to replace ashes? Every time there is a cold wave, ashes have to be applied once, and they are washed away by rainwater, which is laborious and unrewarding. That night, I carried a load of clear sand and did a test in my own seven-point model field. After testing, it proved that the temperature of the seedling field covered with sand was two degrees higher than that of the seedling field not covered with sand, which was labor-saving and water-absorbing. I reported to the Party branch, and the Party branch immediately held an on-site meeting, affirmed this experience, and promoted it.

　　Now our agricultural science research group has grown to 42 people, divided into four groups: agriculture, animal husbandry, economic special products, and tool reform, as well as a weather station. More and more people are learning science, men, women, old and young, are very enthusiastic. Old man Dong Yirong, who is over sixty years old, used to be superstitious about the old almanac. When others removed insects, he said that the insects were released from the sky and could not be removed; now he has completely changed. He has never missed a meeting of the scientific research group, and he also tries to grow three crops of rice. He often said to me: you used your hand holding a hoe to unlock the lock of superstition. Old man Dong is not an isolated example, many old people actively learn science and have become agricultural technicians. The commune members all say: learning science is like eating watermelon in June, the more you eat, the more flavorful it is, and it really quenches your thirst!

　　As for me, although I am overly praised by the commune members as "field doctor" (rice doctor) and have been hired as a special researcher by the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, I am actually similar to everyone else. Without the leadership of the Party and without mass scientific research, I would have accomplished nothing, just like living in the old society for more than 30 years in vain.

　　Our production team has loudly answered the question I raised at the beginning of the article with facts, that is: it is entirely possible! As long as we listen to the Party, have the determination and energy to fully fight against heaven and seize grain from the land, then we will be invincible. "Fighting with heaven is boundless joy! Fighting with the earth is boundless joy! Fighting with people is boundless joy!" This is indeed the case. In the process of studying science, fighting against heaven, and producing more grain, we really feel "boundless joy" day by day, and feel the infinite power of the three red flags. In the future, we will further conquer nature, make the land contribute more grain, and make the mountains and rivers contribute more wealth, and the joy will be even more boundless.

### 与天斗争，其乐无穷

专栏：在我这岗位上

    与天斗争，其乐无穷
    浙江省桐庐县太平人民公社八一生产队队长浙江农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所特约研究员  董鼎荣
    在那土质贫瘠、易涝易旱、年年缺粮的地区，究竟能不能很快转变达到土质肥沃、不涝不旱、变缺粮为余粮的地步？
    解放头几年，这个问题就一直在我脑子里转着。那时候，我们贫雇农在政治上翻了身，当了国家的主人；在经济上也分得了土地，但是还要靠天吃饭。我就想：我们农民在党的领导下力大无穷，难道我们就不能够征服自然，多打粮食吗？能，一定能！
    我们生产队紧靠富春江南岸，风景很好，就是土地不好。沿江五百多亩沙地，是一个“漏缸滩”，土质松散，不易保持水分，而且江上每次涨大水，都要带些沙土来，这一片沙地就越来越高，极易受旱。另外三百多亩水田虽然离江岸稍远，可是地势低，易受涝。这两块田地，年年“三点半雨就成涝，笠帽未干忙抗旱”，忙煞累煞，结果还是缺粮。
    1956年成立了高级社，人多势众，我们就开始向自然宣战：造防洪堤防涝，买抽水机抗旱。在和沿江各社协同努力下，不仅很快做到这步，而且修了水库。从此以后，我们从缺粮区变成了余粮区。
    并不是单靠防洪堤、抽水机、水库，就能年年丰收年年增产的。那不过是与天斗争的第一步，是我们发愤图强的开始，我们要让土地交出更多粮食。于是我们接着改一年一熟为一年二熟。主要措施是旱地改水田，单季稻改双季稻。
    可是因为没经验，开头没弄好，一季早稻，高的收到五百多斤，低的只收二百多斤，遭到了富裕中农的讥笑：“有了一季想两季，做了皇帝想登仙。”我是个喜欢寻根究底的人。这时候，我脑子里就不断转着一个念头：为什么产量高低不一？它和品种、季节、肥料等等有什么关系？农业生产上的谜是多得很的，半辈子过去了，我没解开多少谜，何不依靠集体？支部就决定组织一个农业科学研究小组，推支部书记汪文海为组长，我当副组长。开头没几人，不要紧，慢慢扩大。
    我们采取一学（到外地学习种双季稻的经验）、二找（找高产经验，找低产原因）、三查（查田畈、查产量、查思想）的办法，逐畈逐丘进行了总结，终于找到种好双季稻的五大关键：抓住季节，培育壮秧，大积肥料，密植和防治病虫害。
    我们的粮食亩产量，已从1956年以前“老三百斤”提高到1956年的五百多斤，又提高到1958年的一千斤，到1959年的一千二百三十斤。有的社员自满了，说：“天无边际，地有界线，差不多了。”我却很怀疑：“生产到顶了吗？”翻着我那本社员叫它“万宝全”的生产笔记本，根据上面记载的密植规格、土壤性质、历年来的产量记要，我从江田畈走到白塔畈，又渡江到皇天畈，对畈与畈、丘与丘加以对比研究，为什么同样耕作，江田畈的产量最高？为什么在同一畈田里下的种“太湖青”谷种要比“羊尖籼”稻种产量高？可见得，增产大有潜力。
    同支部书记汪文海同志一商量，我们决定从改造落后畈、推行良种方面入手，达到全面增产要求。结果今年早稻平均亩产比去年的又增产五成八。
    平时我特别注意育秧的试验工作，防止烂秧、培育壮秧。俗语说“秧好一半稻”，一点不假。这就要靠掌握气候，为此，我们建立了气象哨，一面听广播，一面自己总结老农经验，看天行事。播种以后，我们吃在田头，睡在田头。春分时节，天气多变，“一日赤膊，三日棉袄”。每遇寒潮，我们就赶紧起床，去给秧苗盖草木灰。有一次，我路过清沙滩，发现这片沙地非常干燥，伸手摸摸，确实比别的泥地热。我就想：能不能用清沙来代替草木灰呢？草木灰每遇寒潮来一次就盖一次，而且被雨水一淋就冲走，费力不讨好。当晚我挑了一担清沙，在自己的七分样板指挥田里做样子，经过试验，果然证明：用沙壅过的秧田比没用沙壅过的，温度高二度，既省力，又吸水。我跟党支部汇报，党支部马上召开现场会，肯定了这个经验，推广开去。
    如今我们这个农业科学研究小组已经发展到四十二人，分农业、畜牧业、经济特产、工具改革等四个组和一个气象哨。学科学的人越来越多，男女老少，都兴头很大。六十多岁的董亦荣老伯，过去一直迷信老皇历，别人除虫，他说虫是天上放下来的，除不了；现在他完全变了样。科学研究小组开会，他没一次不到，还试种三熟稻。他常跟我说：你用拿锄头的手，敲开了迷信的锁。董老伯不是个别例子，多少老人积极学科学，成了农业技术员。社员们都说：学科学像六月里吃西瓜一样，越吃越有味，真解渴！
    至于我，虽然被社员们过誉地称为“田郎中”
  （水稻的医生），并被浙江农业科学院聘为特约研究员，其实是和大家差不多。若没有党领导，没有群众性的科学研究，我个人将一事无成，像在旧社会里白白活过三十多年一样。
    我们生产队大伙用事实响亮地回答了我在文章开头提出的问题，那就是：完全可以！只要我们听党的话，有充分与天斗争、与地争粮的决心和劲头，那末，我们就所向无敌。“与天斗争，其乐无穷！与地斗争，其乐无穷！与人斗争，其乐无穷！”确实是这样。我们在钻研科学、与天斗争、多打粮食的过程中，确实一天天感到“其乐无穷”，感到三面红旗的无限威力。今后，我们要进一步征服自然，叫土地献出更多的粮食，叫山川献出更多的财富，其乐当更无穷了。
