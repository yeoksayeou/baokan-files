    Hold High the Red Banner of the October Revolution and Advance from Victory to Victory
    Today is the forty-third anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. The Chinese people, with boundless excitement, join the great Soviet people, the working people of the world, and all progressive mankind in celebrating this glorious festival and congratulating the Soviet people on their magnificent victories in building communism.
    The October Revolution opened a new era in human history. As Lenin said, "The important thing is that the ice has been broken, the sea route has been opened, and the road has been pointed out." For forty-three years, the proletariat and working people of the world have been fighting unyieldingly along the route of the October Revolution towards the new world of communism.
    Lenin said: "In the October Revolution, revolutionary violence achieved a brilliant victory." Under Lenin's leadership, the Russian proletariat seized power by armed uprising and overthrew the rule of the bourgeoisie. Since then, on one-sixth of the earth's land, the system of exploitation of man by man has ended, and socialism has been transformed from an ideal into a reality. The October Revolution inherited the cause of the Paris Commune and realized Marx's theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The victory of the October Revolution fundamentally shook the rule of imperialism in the world, inspired the fighting will of the proletariat of the world, and created greater realistic possibilities for the vast people of the colonies and semi-colonies to break their chains of slavery. The road of the October Revolution is the common road for the proletariat and working people of all countries to get rid of oppression and exploitation and strive for freedom and liberation.
    The environment in which the great Soviet people found themselves during the victory of the October Revolution was once very complex and difficult. They had to first take up arms to defend the fruits of the revolution, defeat imperialist armed intervention and domestic counter-revolutionary rebellion; they were surrounded by capitalist countries and subjected to economic blockade; the national economy was devastated by long-term war, riddled with holes. The Soviet people went through hardships, and workers sometimes only received a quarter of a pound of bread a day; however, difficulties could not scare the revolutionary people. With the fearless heroism of the proletariat, the Soviet people relied on their own efforts to overcome unimaginable difficulties and create historical miracles. They spent less than twenty years to complete the industrialization path that all advanced capitalist countries took hundreds of years to achieve. They built a poor and backward Russia into a prosperous and strong socialist industrial power at a speed that no capitalist country could match. By the end of last year, the Soviet Union's total industrial output had increased forty times compared to 1913 before the October Revolution, its total agricultural output had increased by nearly 2.2 times, and its national income had increased by nearly 25 times. From 1917 to 1959, in the forty-two years, the Soviet Union's total industrial output increased at an average annual rate of 10.1%, which is more than three times faster than the average annual growth rate of American industry in the most recent forty-two years. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has formulated the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy for communist construction from 1959 to 1965. This year is the second year of this Seven-Year Plan. In the past two years, the development speed of Soviet industrial production has greatly exceeded the average annual target set by the Seven-Year Plan. At present, the Soviet people are vigorously launching a labor emulation campaign to innovate technology and complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, striving to shorten the time to surpass the United States in terms of per capita industrial and agricultural output. In terms of science and technology, the achievements made by the Soviet people have shocked the world. The Soviet Union was the first to successfully launch an artificial earth satellite; the Soviet Union was the first to use a cosmic rocket to shoot to the moon; the Soviet Union was the first to successfully launch an automatic interplanetary station and uncover the secrets of the far side of the moon; the Soviet Union was the first to launch a spaceship and carry the first batch of cosmic "passengers" safely back to Earth. This series of pioneering achievements has opened the door to interstellar travel. All this also eloquently shows that the Soviet Union has far surpassed the United States in the most important scientific and technological fields.
    The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the great achievements made by the Soviet people. The Chinese people believe that the achievements of the Soviet people are our achievements, and the victories of the Soviet people are our victories. The Chinese people wholeheartedly congratulate the Soviet people on achieving even more brilliant achievements. The greater these achievements, the more they can enhance the confidence of the people of all countries in striving for a better future and strengthen the forces of peace and socialism.
    The victory of the October Revolution spread Marxism-Leninism to the world. Now, 12 countries have achieved the victory of the socialist revolution and realized the dictatorship of the proletariat; the powerful socialist camp already possesses one-third of the world's population and one-quarter of the land area. The socialist camp countries, in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, have established new types of state relations, closely united in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, supporting each other, encouraging each other, and advancing together. At present, all socialist countries in the world are developing their national economies at high speed, accelerating the process of socialist and communist construction. The strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong, attracting more and more people from all countries in the world to actively participate in the struggle for socialism. There are now eighty-six communist parties in the world. The prospect of realizing communism in the whole world has never been as bright as it is today.
    Since the time of the great October Revolution, the national liberation movement in colonies and semi-colonies has entered a new stage. Today, the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are at a new upsurge. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries give enthusiastic support and great encouragement to the national independence movements in various countires; the people of all countries striving for national independence regard the people of the Soviet Union and socialist countries as their most loyal friends. The victorious development of the national independence movement has greatly weakened the strength of the imperialist system and also provided great support to the socialist construction of socialist countries and the struggle of the people of the world for peace. The October Revolution closely linked the socialist revolutionary cause of the proletariat of all countries with the liberation struggle of all oppressed nations. The union of socialist revolution and national liberation movement has accelerated the collapse of the imperialist system and accelerated the victorious process of the struggle of all oppressed nations for national independence and democratic freedom.
    The great Soviet Union is a strong fortress of world peace. The Soviet government has put forward a series of proposals in order to strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, ease international tensions, achieve universal disarmament, and prohibit nuclear weapons. These proposals have been warmly responded to and supported by the people of the world.
    Now, the peace movement of the people of all countries in the world against imperialist aggression and safeguarding world peace has developed unprecedentedly. The days of imperialism are getting harder and harder. But imperialism and its lackeys will never automatically withdraw from the stage of history. The imperialist group headed by the United States is carrying out a frantic struggle, intensifying international tensions, and preparing for a new world war. After sabotaging the Paris Four-Power Summit, US imperialism continues to obstruct disarmament negotiations, openly clamors to subvert socialist countries in Eastern Europe, tries every possible means to undermine the unity of the socialist camp, undermine the struggles of the people of all countries, and suppress and undermine the national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. All these struggles of US imperialism cannot reverse the historical trend that imperialism is bound to fail and the people of all countries are bound to win.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." Marxism-Leninism made the situation of the Chinese revolution brand new. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, after thirty years of arduous struggle, won the victory of the revolution and broke through the imperialist eastern front. For eleven years, the Chinese people have continued to learn from the example of the Soviet people's arduous struggle, and in the struggle against US imperialist aggression and blockade, they have carried out socialist transformation and socialist construction. Since 1958, the Chinese people, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have been changing China's poor and blank face at a leap forward speed. The Chinese revolution is an integral part of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the world. In the revolution and in the construction, the Chinese people have received great assistance from the Soviet Union, which the Chinese people will always be grateful for and will never forget.
    The increasing strength and firm unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union are playing an increasingly important role in the cause of world peace and human progress. We support the Soviet Union's initiatives and efforts to ease international tensions and maintain world peace. The Chinese people will always unite with the Soviet people, and the friendship and unity between them are unbreakable. Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech at the Moscow airport on November 5 was very correct: "This kind of unity has stood the test of history and will be able to withstand the test of history in the future. No matter what happens, no matter whether there are great storms or great difficulties in the world, people will see that the 860 million people of China and the Soviet Union always stand together." The Chinese people will always cherish and continuously strengthen the unity between the two countries of China and the Soviet Union, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soivet Union, and strengthen the unity of the international communist movement with the Communist Party of the Soviet Unioin as the center.
    The forty-three years of historical development since the October Revolution have shown that the new socialist system is bound to replace the old capitalist system in the whole world. The people of socialist countries and the working people of the world will hold higher the glorious banner of the October Revolution and advance from victory to victory.

### 高举十月革命的红旗，从胜利走向胜利

    高举十月革命的红旗，从胜利走向胜利
    今天是伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年。中国人民以无限兴奋的心情，同伟大的苏联人民一起，同全世界的劳动人民、全体进步人类一起，共同庆祝这个光辉的节日，并且祝贺苏联人民在建设共产主义的事业中取得的辉煌胜利。
    十月革命为人类历史开辟了新纪元。正像列宁说的：“重要的是，坚冰已经打破，航线已经开通，道路已经指明。”四十三年来，全世界无产阶级和劳动人民，沿着十月革命的航线，为着走向共产主义的新世界，而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    列宁说：“在十月革命中，革命暴力取得了辉煌的胜利”。俄国无产阶级在列宁领导下，以武装起义夺取了政权，推翻了资产阶级统治。从此，在地球六分之一的土地上，结束了人剥削人的制度，把社会主义从理想变成了现实。十月革命，继承巴黎公社的事业，实现了马克思关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。十月革命的胜利，从根本上动摇了帝国主义在全世界的统治，鼓舞了全世界无产阶级的斗争意志，也为殖民地半殖民地广大人民创造了打碎奴隶镣铐的更大的现实可能性。十月革命的道路是各国无产阶级和劳动人民摆脱压迫和剥削，争取自由解放的共同道路。
    伟大的苏联人民在十月革命胜利的过程中所处的环境，曾经是很复杂和很困难的。他们曾不得不首先拿起武器捍卫革命的果实，击溃帝国主义武装干涉和国内反革命叛乱；他们处在资本主义国家的包围和经济封锁之中；国民经济遭到长期战争的摧残，千疮百孔。苏联人民历尽了艰辛，工人们有时每天只能领到四分之一磅的面包；但是，困难吓不倒革命的人民。苏联人民以无产阶级大无畏的英雄气概，自力更生，克服了难以想像的困难，创造出历史的奇迹。他们用了不到二十年的时间，走完所有先进的资本主义国家花了上百年时间才能达到的工业化的道路，他们以任何资本主义国家所望尘莫及的速度，把一个贫穷落后的俄国建设成繁荣富强的社会主义工业强国。到去年年底，苏联的工业总产值，已经增加为十月革命前1913年的四十倍，农业总产值增加为将近二点二倍，国民收入增加为将近二十五倍。从1917年到1959年的四十二年间，苏联的工业总产值每年平均增长10.1％，比最近四十二年美国工业每年平均增长速度快三倍多。苏联共产党制订了进行共产主义建设的1959年到1965年发展国民经济七年计划。今年是这个七年计划的第二年。两年来，苏联工业生产的发展速度，大大超过了七年计划所规定的平均年度指标。目前，苏联人民正在蓬蓬勃勃地展开革新技术和提前完成七年计划的劳动竞赛，争取缩短时间实现在按人口平均计算的工农业产量方面超过美国。在科学?技术方面，苏联人民所取得的成就，震动了全世界。第一个成功地发射地球人造卫星的是苏联；第一个用宇宙火箭射到月球的是苏联；第一个成功地发射了自动行星际站、揭开月球背面的秘密的是苏联；第一个发射宇宙飞船，并且载着第一批宇宙的“旅客”安返地球的，是苏联。这一系列的创举，打开了星际旅行的大门。这一切，也雄辩地说明了，苏联已在最重要的科学技术方面，远远地走在美国的前头。
    中国人民对于苏联人民所取得的伟大成就感到欢欣鼓舞。中国人民认为，苏联人民的成就就是我们的成就，苏联人民的胜利就是我们的胜利。中国人民由衷地祝贺苏联人民取得更加辉煌的成就。这种成就越大，越能增强各国人民争取美好未来的信心，增强和平和社会主义的力量。
    十月革命的胜利，把马克思列宁主义传播到全世界。现在，已经有12个国家取得了社会主义革命的胜利和实现了无产阶级专政；强大的社会主义阵营已经拥有世界人口的三分之一，土地面积的四分之一。社会主义阵营各国，按照马克思列宁主义、无产阶级国际主义原则，建立了新型的国家关系，紧密地团结在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，彼此支援，互相鼓舞，共同前进。目前，全世界所有的社会主义国家，都正在高速度地发展国民经济，加速社会主义和共产主义的建设进程。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量空前强大，吸引了世界各国越来越多的人民积极参加争取社会主义的斗争。现在世界上已经有了八十六个共产党。在全世界实现共产主义的前景，从来没有像今天这样光明。
    从伟大的十月革命那时起，殖民地和半殖民地的民族解放运动就进入一个新阶段。今天，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动正处在一个新的高潮中。苏联和各社会主义国家给予各国民族独立运动以热情的支援和巨大的鼓舞；一切争取民族独立国家的人民，都把苏联和社会主义国家的人民看成是他们最忠实的朋友。民族独立运动的胜利发展，大大地削弱了帝国主义体系的力量，也给予社会主义各国的社会主义建设和世界人民争取和平的斗争以巨大的支援。十月革命把各国无产阶级的社会主义革命事业和一切被压迫民族解放斗争紧密地联结在一起。社会主义革命和民族解放运动的联合，加速了帝国主义体系的崩溃，加速了一切被压迫民族争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争的胜利进程。
    伟大的苏联是世界和平的强大堡垒。苏联政府为了争取不同社会制度国家的和平共处，和缓国际紧张局势，实现普遍裁军，禁止核武器，提出了一系列的建议。这些建议，获得了全世界人民的热烈响应和支持。
    现在，世界各国人民反对帝国主义侵略，维护世界和平斗争的和平运动，空前发展。帝国主义的日子越来越不好过了。但是帝国主义及其走狗绝不会自动退出历史舞台。以美国为首的帝国主义集团正在进行疯狂的挣扎，加剧国际紧张局势，准备新的世界战争。在破坏巴黎四国首脑会议以后，美帝国主义继续阻挠裁军谈判，公然叫嚣要颠复东欧社会主义国家，千方百计地破坏社会主义阵营的团结，破坏各国人民的斗争，镇压和破坏亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动。美帝国主义的这一切挣扎，是扭转不了帝国主义一定要失败、各国人民一定要胜利这个历史的车轮的。
    毛泽东同志说过：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”马克思列宁主义使中国革命的局面为之一新。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，经过三十年的艰苦斗争，赢得了革命的胜利，突破了帝国主义的东方战线。十一年来，中国人民继续学习苏联人民艰苦奋斗的榜样，在同美帝国主义侵略和封锁的斗争中，进行了社会主义改造和社会主义建设。1958年以来，中国人民高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，以跃进的速度，改变着中国一穷二白的面貌。中国革命是全世界无产阶级革命事业的一个组成部分。在革命中，在建设中，中国人民都得到来自苏联的巨大援助，这是中国人民永远感谢、永远不会忘记的。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的日益强大和坚强团结，正在对世界和平和人类进步的事业起着越来越大的作用。我们支持苏联为和缓国际紧张局势，维护世界和平的倡议和努力。中国人民将永远和苏联人民团结在一起，他们之间的友谊和团结是牢不可破的。刘少奇同志11月5日在莫斯科机场上的讲话，说得很对：“这种团结经过了历史的考验，并且在以后还将受得起历史的考验，不论在什么情况下，不论世界上是否发生巨大的风波和巨大的困难，人们都会看到，中苏两国八亿六千万人民总是站在一起的。”中国人民将永远珍视和不断加强中苏两国的团结，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，加强以苏联共产党为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结。
    十月革命以来的四十三年的历史发展表明：在全世界，社会主义新制度一定要代替资本主义的旧制度。社会主义各国人民和全世界劳动人民，将更加高举十月革命的光辉旗帜，从胜利走向胜利。
