Xinhua News Agency report: In the upsurge of the whole Party and the entire people engaging in agriculture and large-scale grain production, a great situation has emerged in the production of state-owned farms in our country. This year, state-owned farms have strengthened leadership on the front lines of production, further rationally organized labor, and leveraged the effectiveness of agricultural machinery. As a result, despite the ravages of natural disasters such as drought and floods, significant achievements in production have been made. The current autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing work are proceeding rapidly and well, demonstrating the great superiority of the all-people ownership and mechanized agricultural enterprises.

The entire staff of state-owned farms in our country enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to engage in agriculture and large-scale grain production, and launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, centered on increasing grain production. Since mid-September, farms across the country have been comprehensively carrying out the "Three Autumns" production work. After more than a month of intensive harvesting, plowing, and planting, the autumn-ripening crops on the farms have been basically harvested, and more than two-thirds of the autumn plowing and planting tasks have also been completed. This year's "Three Autumns" work on state-owned farms has been better prepared, started earlier, organized better, and has stronger leadership than in previous years. All farms have concentrated labor, agricultural machinery, and animal power on the front lines of the "Three Autumns" production. Based on the nature and urgency of agricultural work, various specialized teams have been formed, and the harvesting, plowing, and planting work is being carried out in a planned and orderly manner. Leading cadres from the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation and various farms have personally gone to the production front lines to participate in and lead production, promptly solve new problems arising in production, and organize labor competitions, which have stimulated the production enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and ensured the rapid progress and high quality of all autumn production tasks. State-owned farms in the Northeast and Northwest reclamation areas successfully completed their autumn planting tasks around the time of "Frost's Descent."

This year, under the guidance of the Party's ideology of taking agriculture as the foundation, state-owned farms in various regions have conscientiously implemented the policy of simultaneously pursuing multiple planting for more yield and high yield for more yield, actively reclaiming wasteland, expanding cultivated area, and planting more grain crops. According to statistics from the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, by the end of the third quarter of this year, the area of wasteland already reclaimed by state-owned farms across the country was 150% larger than the area reclaimed throughout last year. Therefore, the area sown to spring and summer crops on state-owned farms this year increased by 50% compared to last year, of which the area sown to grain crops expanded by 70% compared to last year. In this year's production, all farms have further implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and vigorously increased yield per unit area. While meticulously cultivating existing farmland, many farms have simultaneously reclaimed wasteland and planted crops, and have made every effort to use "ten edges" and vacant land to expand the planting area.

This year, as a result of the implementation of the policy of taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development by state-owned farms in various regions, not only have grain crops increased, but diversified operations have also greatly developed, especially in livestock production, with significant increases in pigs, cattle, horses, sheep, and poultry compared to last year.

This year, agricultural machinery on state-owned farms has further demonstrated its power in land reclamation and production, demonstrating the superiority of mechanization and significantly increasing labor productivity. In land reclamation, farms have deployed a large number of tractors, which not only reclaimed a large amount of wasteland at high speed, but also ensured the quality of land reclamation. Therefore, more than 60% of the newly reclaimed wasteland this year was sown in the same year. In the current intensive "Three Autumns" production, the superiority of mechanized operations is even more obvious. All field operations such as plowing, planting, and harvesting on state-owned farms are mainly carried out by agricultural machinery, and the degree of mechanization of non-field operations such as transportation and processing, as well as livestock production, has also been greatly improved. The Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation and the leading organs of farms in various regions have paid attention to fully utilizing the production potential of agricultural machinery in this year's production. In order to make full use of existing agricultural machinery, state-owned farms under the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation have also organized mechanical cooperation and mutual support between the South and the North. Currently, some state-owned farms in the Northeast region, after completing their autumn plowing tasks, are transferring machinery to Shandong and other places to support winter plowing and land reclamation.

At present, while intensifying the "Three Autumns," farms are also launching a campaign to accumulate and produce fertilizer in order to strive for a bumper harvest next year. (Attached picture)

### 国营农场战胜旱涝发展生产  三季度垦荒面积比去年全年大一倍半

    国营农场战胜旱涝发展生产
    三季度垦荒面积比去年全年大一倍半
    据新华社讯　在全党全民大办农业，大办粮食运动的高潮中，我国国营农场生产出现了一派大好形势。今年国营农场加强了生产第一线的领导，进一步合理地组织劳力和发挥农业机械的效能，因此在旱涝等自然灾害侵袭的情况下，生产获得了很大的成就。当前的秋收、秋种、秋耕工作正在又快、又好地进行，显示了全民所有制和机械化农业企业的巨大优越性。
    我国国营农场的全体职工热烈地响应党的大办农业，大办粮食的号召，掀起了轰轰烈烈以增产粮食为中心内容的增产节约运动。各地农场从9月中旬起就全面地进行三秋生产工作，经过一个多月的突击抢收、抢耕、抢种，目前各农场的秋熟作物已经基本上收完，秋耕、秋种任务也完成了三分之二以上。今年国营农场的“三秋”工作比往年准备充分，动手早，组织得好，领导力量强，各农场都把劳力和农业机械以及畜力集中到三秋生产的第一线，并根据农活的性质和缓急，组成各种专业队，有计划地有秩序地分头进行收、耕、种工作。农垦部和各农场的领导干部都亲临生产前线，参加生产领导生产，及时地解决生产中出现的新问题，组织劳动竞赛，激发了广大职工的生产积极性，保证了秋季生产各项工作进度快，质量高。东北、西北垦区的国营农场在“霜降”前后都胜利地完成了秋种任务。
    今年各地的国营农场在党的以农业为基础的思想指导下，认真地贯彻执行了多种多收和高产多收同时并举的方针，积极地开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积，多种粮食作物。据农垦部的统计，到今年第三季末全国国营农场已经开垦的荒地面积，比去年全年垦荒面积大一倍半，因此今年国营农场的春播和夏播作物面积比去年增加了二分之一，其中粮食作物播种面积比去年扩大70％。各农场在今年生产中都进一步贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，大力提高单位面积产量。许多农场在精耕细做种好原有农田的同时，边垦荒边播种，并且千方百计地利用“十边”和空隙地扩大种植面积。
    今年各地国营农场执行以粮为纲，全面发展方针的结果，不仅粮食作物增加，多种经营也有了很大发展，特别是畜牧业生产，猪、牛、马、羊和家禽等都比去年有较大幅度的增长。
    今年，国营农场的农业机械在开荒和生产中进一步显示了它的威力，显示了机械化的优越性，显著地提高了劳动生产率。开荒中，各农场出动了大批拖拉机，不仅高速度地开垦了大量荒地，而且保证了开荒的质量，因此今年新开的荒地有60％以上当年都播了种。在当前紧张的三秋生产中，机械作业的优越性更加明显，所有国营农场的翻耕、播种、收割等田间作业都主要是依靠农业机械进行的，运输、加工等非田间作业的机械化和畜牧业生产的机械化程度也有了很大的提高。农垦部和各地农场领导机关，在今年生产中，都注意了充分发挥农业机械的生产潜力。为了充分利用现有的农业机械，农垦部系统的国营农场还组织了南方和北方的机械协作和互相支援。目前，东北地区有些国营农场在完成了秋耕任务以后，正抽调机械到山东等地支援冬耕和开荒。
    目前，各农场在突击“三秋”的同时，为了争取明年大丰收还掀起了积肥造肥运动。（附图片）
