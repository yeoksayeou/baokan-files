    Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's Thoughts on People's War
    Chen Bojun
    The fourth volume of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is a vivid record of the great historical facts of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War of the Chinese people and a profound summary of valuable experiences. This domestic revolutionary war was a decisive battle between the armed revolution and the armed counter-revolution on the land accounting for a quarter of the world's population. It was a domestic war of unprecedented scale in Chinese history and even world history. It was also the most thorough people's war conducted in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial major power under the leadership of the proletariat and its vanguard—the Communist Party. Comrade Mao Zedong correctly and vividly combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, not only prescribing a uniquely correct political line for our party, but also prescribing a uniquely correct military line for our party. The thought of people's war is precisely a red line running through this military line and is the basic content of Mao Zedong's military thought. The long revolutionary war waged by the Chinese people under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong has continuously achieved one victory after another along this correct line until the dark rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China was completely overthrown.
    What kind of war is the people's war conducted under the guidance of Mao Zedong's military thought? This kind of war is one in which, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we firmly believe in and rely on the masses of the people, and fully mobilize and organize the broad masses of the people to fight the enemy directly or indirectly. Its organizational form is the combination of main force corps and local corps, the combination of the army and the militia, and the combination of armed masses and unarmed masses; its operational policy is the combination of regular warfare and irregular warfare, that is, the combination of regular mobile warfare, positional warfare and irregular guerrilla warfare; at the same time, it is also the combination of armed struggle and other various necessary forms of struggle, that is, the combination of the struggle on the military front with the struggle on the political, economic, and cultural fronts, resulting in a total war and an all-out war. These are essentially the specific application of the mass line consistently advocated and adhered to by Comrade Mao Zedong in the revolutionary war, that is, launching a mass movement on a large scale in the revolutionary war, fully mobilizing the power of the masses to wage war in order to defeat the enemy. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of people's war was formed and developed in the long revolutionary war and is the crystallization of the experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary war. In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of people's war was not only fully embodied, but also had new developments.
    The content contained in Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of people's war is extremely broad and extremely rich. This article can only briefly discuss my learning experience on the main issues in several major aspects.
    Boldly arouse the masses, unite more than 90% of the people, and form a broad united front to overthrow the reactionaries.
    When Chiang Kai-shek perfidiously launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas in July 1946, the balance of power between the enemy and us was disparate. Chiang Kai-shek had 4.3 million reactionary troops, supported and aided by American imperialism wielding atomic weapons, controlled major cities across the country and regions accounting for three-quarters of the country's population, and had 90,000 American Marines stationed in many important cities in China; while the Chinese People's Liberation Army, divided into more than a dozen base areas, only had a total force of 1.2 million, not only at a disadvantage in numbers, but also far behind the enemy in terms of technical equipment. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek had arrogantly declared: It would only take three to six months to defeat the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Within the people, there were also many people who lacked confidence in whether they could repel the offensive of the Kuomintang reactionaries and expressed concern about the future of the war. At this critical juncture, Comrade Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Party and the people, the great helmsman of the Chinese revolution, put forward the famous thesis that "all reactionaries are paper tigers." He pointed out: "It seems that the reactionaries look terrible, but in fact they do not have much strength. Looking at the problem from a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." ① Comrade Mao Zedong's wise judgment armed the minds of the Chinese people, enhanced their confidence and courage in defeating Chiang Kai-shek, and played an extremely great role in mobilizing the people of the whole country to rise up and use revolutionary war to crush the counter-revolutionary war launched by the American Chiang reactionaries. Later, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on a profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the strength of the enemy and ourselves, further predicted: It may take about five years to fundamentally overthrow the Kuomintang. This prediction became a great call, greatly boosted the revolutionary enthusiasm of the army and the people, and further exerted the infinite power of the masses of the people, resulting in the early realization of this prediction. With the full support of the people of the whole country, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, after three and a half years of heroic fighting, eliminated more than 8 million of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary troops and finally won the victory of the revolutionary war.
    From this, it can be seen that Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that all reactionaries are paper tigers, pointed out that Chiang's army would inevitably be defeated, and our army would inevitably win, teaching us to despise the enemy strategically and value the enemy tactically, to dare to win and be good at fighting, demonstrating Comrade Mao Zedong's greatest confidence in the strength and role of the masses of the people, and demonstrating Comrade Mao Zedong's firm Marxist-Leninist stance of believing in and relying on the masses.
    Marxism-Leninism believes that war is a historical phenomenon in class society and the most acute form of class struggle. The outcome of war is mainly not determined by the temporary advantage of military power, let alone solely by one or two new weapons. Comrade Mao Zedong had long said: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." ② The direction of people's hearts is inseparable from the nature of the war and is a factor that constantly plays a role in the war. All counter-revolutionary wars are unjust wars. This kind of war is anti-people, and therefore it is bound to be divorced from the people and opposed by the people; all revolutionary wars are just wars. This kind of war is consistent with the interests of the people, and therefore it is bound to be supported by the people. When the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale civil war under the instigation and help of American imperialism, although it had an advantage in military strength, the injustice of the war aroused the opposition of the people of the whole country, which became its fatal weakness; while the Chinese People's Liberation Army, although temporarily at a disadvantage in terms of quantity and equipment, the justice of the war and the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the people gave the Liberation Army an absolute advantage politically. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The advantage of Chiang Kai-shek's military strength is only a temporary phenomenon and only a temporary factor; the aid of American imperialism is also only a temporary factor; the anti-people nature of Chiang Kai-shek's war and the direction of people's hearts are constant factors; and in this regard, the People's Liberation Army has the advantage. The patriotic, just, and revolutionary nature of the People's Liberation Army's war will inevitably win the support of the people of the whole country. This is the political basis for defeating Chiang Kai-shek." ③
    Because the revolutionary just war is consistent with the interests of the broad masses of the people and is supported by the broad masses of the people, there is a possibility of achieving final victory. However, to transform this possibility into reality, we must be good at using this condition to fully mobilize and organize the broad masses of the people to participate in and support the revolutionary war directly or indirectly. In this way, the correctness of the subjective guidance of the war has a decisive significance. The same revolutionary just war often presents two different situations: one situation is that we are afraid or do not believe in the power of the masses of the people, and dare not or are unwilling to fully mobilize the broad masses of the people to participate in the war; the other situation is that we fully trust and rely on the masses of the people, and make every effort to mobilize and organize the masses of the people to the greatest extent to conduct a broad people's war. The two different attitudes towards the masses of the people formed the watershed between bourgeois revolutionaries and proletarian revolutionaries, and is a fundamental difference between Marxism-Leninism and right-leaning opportunism. In the history of the Chinese revolution, the long-standing struggle between the bourgeois military line and the proletarian military line was a concentrated manifestation of the two fundamentally different attitudes towards the masses of the people. Comrade Mao Zedong's great contribution to the Chinese revolutionary war lies in the fact that, as an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, he used Marxism-Leninism to guide the practice of the Chinese revolutionary war, thoroughly solving the fundamental problem of how to fully mobilize and organize the masses of the people to participate in the revolutionary war and conduct the broadest people's war. He prescribed and adhered to the correct Marxist-Leninist military line, carried out an irreconcilable struggle with the bourgeois military line, and guided the Chinese people's revolutionary war to victory step by step.
    Comrade Mao Zedong had long said: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can war be waged." ④ He also said: "If we want to make a summary of the revolution over the past few decades, it is that...to overthrow imperialism and feudalism, it is only possible to mobilize and organize the working class and peasant masses who account for 90% of the country's population." ⑤ During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly emphasized that it is necessary to boldly arouse the masses, resolutely unite more than 90% of the people of the country, strive for everyone who can be won over, form a broad united front, and isolate the reactionaries to the greatest extent in order to overthrow the reactionaries. This united front includes workers, peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, other patriotic elements, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and so on. Comrade Mao Zedong not only called on the whole Party to pay constant attention to doing mass work, and regard mobilizing the broad masses of the people to participate in the revolutionary war as a fundamental task of the Party during the war; moreover, he also taught the Chinese People's Liberation Army to "everyone learn two skills: destroying the enemy and awakening the masses, and closely unite with the masses," ⑥ only in this way can the power of the People's Liberation Army be invincible in the world.
    To enable the broad masses of the people to participate in and support the revolutionary war, we must rely on the revolutionary consciousness of the masses, not on the orders of the leaders. In his conversation with the editors of the Jin Sui Daily on April 2, 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our Party has been doing mass work every day for more than 20 years, and talking about the mass line every day for nearly ten years. We have always advocated that the revolution should rely on the masses of the people, everyone should do it, and oppose relying only on a few people to issue orders." ⑦ In the war, on the front line, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with unparalleled heroism, used inferior equipment to fight enemies with superior equipment, fearing no hardship and fighting heroically and tenaciously, one after another; in the rear, the broad masses of the people sent their sons and husbands to join the army, transported grain and grass, and sent stretchers to support the front line, providing full support to the war in terms of manpower and material resources; wherever the enemy went, the broad masses of the people organized themselves, took up all usable weapons, and used all possible methods to attack the enemy and cooperate with the frontal operations; the people of the whole country, on various different fronts, united to carry out a resolute struggle against the enemy. All of this demonstrated the high degree of revolutionary consciousness of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. The reactionaries always slandered our broad and in-depth mass movement, calling it the Communist Party's "coercion." In fact, no coercion could produce such a mass movement. This is something they will never understand and will never be able to understand. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "The basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is to make the masses realize their own interests and unite to fight for their own interests." ⑧ Starting from this principle, our Party has consistently attached importance to enlightening the consciousness of the people and raising the political awareness of the people; at the same time, our Party's policies and guidelines are not only known to the leaders, but also known to the broad masses, so that they can become the conscious actions of the masses.
    In short, in guiding the Chinese revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong firmly adhered to the objective truth of Marxism-Leninism: The people are the creators of history, and true history is the history of the masses of the people. Without the production struggle and social struggle of the masses of the people, society cannot exist and develop. The shackles on the people can only be broken by the people's own hands; the happy life of the people can only be created by the people's own hands; all revolutionary undertakings can only be successful through the people's own struggle. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The people, only the people, are the motive force for creating world history." ⑨ This is the fundamental starting point of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of people's war.
    The combination of main force corps and local corps, the combination of regular army and militia, the combination of armed masses and unarmed masses
    The central content of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought of people's war is to implement universal arming and universal conscription. That is to say, on the one hand, we must organize a people's army as the backbone force for carrying out people's war and the main tool for attacking the enemy. The loyal service of this army to the people and its close relationship with the masses of the people are the source of its power; on the other hand, we must widely establish armed organizations of the masses of the people, organize all those who can be organized under the principles of voluntariness, democracy, and non-separation from production, take up all usable weapons, and directly participate in armed struggle to cooperate with the army in combat. And the best form of this people's armed organization is the militia. The army and the militia go hand in hand and cooperate with each other. This is the specific application of the policy of "walking on two legs" mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong in the people's war.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army, created and nurtured by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, is such a people's army as mentioned above. This army comes from the people and has an intimate relationship with the broad masses of the people, standing closely with the people and wholeheartedly serving the people. This army is under the absolute leadership of the Party, and the leadership system of the army is the system of division of responsibilities among the leaders under the collective leadership of the Party committee. The army has strong political work - this is the lifeline of the people's army; this army implements the principle of unity between the army and the people, and protects the interests of the people everywhere. It is not only a combat team, but also a work team and a production team; this army implements the principle of unity between officers and soldiers, unity between superiors and subordinates within the army, and implements the three major democracies, namely, political democracy, military democracy, and economic democracy, and implements the principle of combining centralization and democracy, combining the unified leadership of the superiors and the active initiative and creativity of the subordinates. The implementation of these Marxist-Leninist principles of army building has enabled this army to maintain a close relationship with the masses of the people forever, and to be sincerely supported and fully supported by the broad masses of the people. The implementation of these principles has made this army have iron-like unity within it, infinite wisdom and creativity, and a fighting spirit of courage, tenacity, and indomitable advance. During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, while carrying out the vigorous land reform movement and the Party rectification movement, the Chinese People's Liberation Army carried out a new type of military rectification movement with great significance. This new type of military rectification movement was carried out by means of "speaking out grievances" (that is, speaking out the suffering inflicted on the working people by the old society and the reactionaries) and "three investigations" (investigating class, investigating work, and investigating fighting spirit) and "three rectifications" (rectifying organization, rectifying ideology, and rectifying style). This was a mass self-education movement and a large-scale democratic movement within the army. This new type of military rectification movement was an important development of our army's political work and democratic movement under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on army building. This military rectification movement greatly enhanced the political awareness and combat will of all officers and soldiers, accelerated the transformation process of the large number of captured Kuomintang army soldiers who were added to the Liberation Army; at the same time, it purified and consolidated the organization of the troops, strengthened the organization and discipline of the troops, and further promoted the political democracy, military democracy, and economic democracy of the army, playing a huge role in the development and growth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the victory of combat. Especially in training, officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, and soldiers teach soldiers, teaching and learning from each other. In combat, "Zhuge Liang meetings" are held before the battle to mobilize the masses to discuss how to complete the combat tasks under leadership, and democratic combat reviews are conducted after the battle to summarize and review combat experiences and lessons. These practices fully demonstrated the enthusiasm of the broad masses of soldiers and brought the collective wisdom and strength into full play, effectively ensuring the victory of the battle. At the same time, it also prominently demonstrated the characteristics of the people's army and people's war.
    In order to wage people's war and defeat powerful enemies, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has always divided itself into two parts: the main force corps and the local corps. The main force corps are the backbone and elite of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which can perform super-local combat missions at any time, and conduct large-scale battles and combats in cooperation with the local corps and the militia. The local corps are fixed in certain areas to defend the local areas and attack the local enemies. The local corps include a part of regular or more regular troops, and also include a large number of scattered county and district guerrillas. The local corps also organizes many small and efficient armed work teams that have been well-trained and are good at conducting various military, political, and civilian mobilization work to penetrate deep into the enemy's rear, attack the enemy, and mobilize and organize the people to conduct revolutionary struggles to cooperate with the combat on the front line. There are many benefits to establishing such a local corps: First, the local corps are native to the area, have close ties with the local people, and are familiar with the local geographical environment, customs, and habits, which makes it easier to integrate with the local people, making it easier for the army to take root among the local people and win the sincere support of the people. Second, the establishment of a local corps with a fixed area facilitates the close integration of armed struggle with other necessary forms of struggle under the unified leadership of the local Party and government to consolidate and expand the revolutionary base areas. Third, the local corps undertakes the task of training and training the militia, which facilitates the development of people's armed forces; at the same time, the local corps is also the backbone of the broad militia's struggle against the enemy. Fourth, the local corps is also a powerful assistant and strong reserve force of the main force corps, undertaking the task of cooperating with the main force in combat, gathering under certain conditions to coordinate with the main force in combat, jointly attacking and annihilating the enemy. When it becomes stronger and stronger in the execution of various tasks and gradually improves to the level of the main force, it can be transformed into the main force corps to perform greater tasks when necessary. In the long revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong has consistently attached great importance to the construction of these two parts of the army, and opposed the tendency of only valuing the main force corps and not valuing the local corps; moreover, under necessary circumstances, he also implemented the principle of localizing and massifying the main force army to achieve favorable dispersal. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the assistance of American imperialism, transported troops to Northeast China in a big way by sea, land, and air, and the Northeast region was facing a serious struggle, Comrade Mao Zedong foresaw the arduousness of the revolutionary struggle in the Northeast region, and promptly instructed the correct policy, and pointed out: "Quickly divide the West Manchuria, East Manchuria, and North Manchuria into military regions and military sub-regions, and divide the army into field armies and local armies. Disperse a considerable part of the regular army to various military sub-regions to engage in mobilizing the masses, eliminating bandits, establishing political power, and organizing guerrillas, militia, and self-defense forces, in order to stabilize the local areas, cooperate with the field armies, and crush the Kuomintang's offensive. All armies must have a clear area and mission in order to quickly combine with the people and establish a solid base area." ⑩ Later facts fully proved the correctness of these instructions.
    In the long revolutionary war, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's military thought, the Chinese people not only built a powerful people's army under the leadership of the Communist Party, but also built a powerful militia force under the leadership of the Communist Party. In the past revolutionary wars, Comrade Mao Zedong has always regarded the establishment of people's armed forces and the widespread development of the people's armed struggle as a huge strategic task. With the continuous development of the revolutionary situation and the continuous expansion of the revolutionary base areas, this vast armed force of the masses has grown stronger and stronger, and its organization has become more and more perfect. By the end of the Anti-Japanese War, it had developed into a huge force of more than two million people. During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, in order to crush the offensive of the Kuomintang reactionaries and liberate all of China, each liberated area, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, further rapidly developed and expanded the militia organization. This vast armed organization of the masses of the people played an extremely great role in the revolutionary war, and powerfully guaranteed the victory of the war. The militia is a capable assistant to the People's Liberation Army. It is familiar with the people and the land, widely distributed, and convenient for widely carrying out guerrilla warfare, ghost warfare, siege warfare, mine warfare, and sabotage warfare, attacking the enemy everywhere, giving the enemy harassment, fatigue, consumption, and casualties; it guards posts and blocks news, turning the enemy into deaf and blind; it detects enemy situations, sends intelligence, and acts as a guide, turning our army into "far-sighted eyes" and "clairaudient ears." When necessary, it concentrates to support and cooperate with the army's large-scale operations, such as in the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, where the militia formed divisions and regiments to accompany the army on long expeditions for a long time, undertaking various war services. In the famous Huaihai Campaign, the militia accompanying the army to carry out various war services reached 2 million people, powerfully guaranteeing the victory of this great campaign. The militia is a powerful reserve force for the People's Liberation Army, the best way to "hide soldiers among the people," and the solid foundation of the people's war in terms of manpower. In the war, according to the needs of the war, under the call of the Party and the People's Government, the militia always consciously and voluntarily joined the army in batches, constantly strengthening the power of the People's Liberation Army. Since the militia has already undergone certain training and actual combat experience, once they join the army, they quickly become a strong fighting force in the army. The militia is an important force for maintaining social order and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and an important tool for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. With the militia, it is possible to ensure the consolidation of our army's rear, so that the frontline troops can fight with all their strength without any worries. The militia is also the backbone force for production and construction in the revolutionary base areas, and a good educational organization for the people. The victory of the Chinese revolutionary war is inseparable from the great role of the militia, and the great role of the militia vividly embodies the people's nature of the revolutionary war and the extensive nature of the people's war.
    In addition, all unarmed organizations among the people, such as workers', peasants', youth, women, cultural, and other professional and work people's organizations, under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, carry out various work to support the war and aid the army, including mobilizing the people to join the army, giving preferential treatment to military families, helping the army solve various material difficulties, transporting food, ammunition, and various military supplies for the army, destroying the enemy's transportation to prevent the enemy's attack, repairing bridges and roads for our army to help our army advance smoothly to annihilate the enemy, guarding posts, eliminating traitors and spies, disintegrating the enemy army, detecting enemy situations, blocking news, rescuing and transporting wounded soldiers, conducting condolence and mobilization work on the front line, until cooperating with guerrillas and militia to carry out blasting operations and attacking the enemy, using all possible forces and all feasible ways to help the army fight directly or indirectly. At the same time, the entire people of the liberated areas enthusiastically engaged in various construction undertakings such as politics, economy, and culture, especially making every effort to develop production in order to ensure military and civilian needs and support the long-term war. In short, everything for the front line and everything for the victory of the war is the general slogan and general policy of the entire army and people in the liberated areas.
    The main force corps, the local corps, and the militia converge into an armed torrent, plus the full support of the unarmed masses of the people, making any powerful enemy unable to resist. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Make it like a wild bull rushing into a fire, and we will startle it with a shout, and this wild bull will have to be burned to death."?

    学习毛泽东同志关于人民战争的思想
    陈伯钧
    《毛泽东选集》第四卷，是中国人民第三次国内革命战争伟大史实的生动记录和宝贵经验的深刻总结。这次国内革命战争，是在占全世界四分之一人口的土地上武装的革命与武装的反革命的决战，是中国历史上也是世界历史上一次规模空前巨大的国内战争，又是在无产阶级及其先锋队——共产党领导下，在一个半封建半殖民地的大国所进行的一次最彻底的人民战争。毛泽东同志正确地和生动地把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命的具体实践相结合，不仅为我们党规定了一条唯一正确的政治路线，而且也为我们党规定了一条唯一正确的军事路线。人民战争的思想正是贯穿这条军事路线的一条红线，是毛泽东军事思想的基本内容。中国人民在毛泽东同志领导下进行的长期的革命战争，就是沿着这条正确的路线不断地取得了一个又一个的胜利，直到把帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的黑暗统治彻底推翻。
    在毛泽东军事思想指导下所进行的人民战争是怎样的战争呢？这种战争就是在共产党的领导下，坚定地相信和依靠人民群众，把广大的人民群众充分地动员和组织起来，直接地或间接地一致对敌作战。它的组织形式，是主力兵团与地方兵团相结合，军队与民兵相结合，武装的群众与非武装的群众相结合；它的作战方针，是正规战与非正规战相结合，即正规的运动战、阵地战与非正规的游击战相结合；同时，它又是武装斗争与其它各种必要的斗争形式相结合，即军事战线的斗争与政治战线、经济战线、文化战线的斗争相结合的全民战争和总体战争。这些实质上就是毛泽东同志所一贯倡导和一贯坚持的群众路线在革命战争中的具体运用，就是在革命战争中大搞群众运动，充分地调动人民群众的力量进行战争，以打败敌人。毛泽东同志的人民战争的思想，是在长期的革命战争中形成和发展起来的，是中国人民革命战争经验的结晶。第三次国内革命战争中，毛泽东同志的人民战争思想不但得到完全的体现，而且有了新的发展。
    毛泽东同志的人民战争思想所包含的内容是极其广泛、极其丰富的。本文只能就几个主要方面中的主要问题，简要地谈一谈自己的学习心得。
    放手发动群众，团结百分之九十以上的人民大众，结成广泛的统一战线，打倒反动派。
    当1946年7月蒋介石背信弃义地悍然发动对解放区的全面进攻时，敌我双方力量的对比是悬殊的。蒋介石有四百三十万反动军队，有挥舞着原子武器的美帝国主义的支持和援助，控制着全国的大城市和占全国人口四分之三的地区，有驻扎在中国许多重要城市的九万美国海军陆战队的坐镇，而被分割在十几块根据地里的中国人民解放军，总兵力才只有一百二十万人，不仅在数量上居于劣势，而且在技术装备上也远远地落后于敌人。那时，蒋介石曾经狂妄地宣称：只须三个月至六个月，就可以打败中国人民解放军。在人民内部也有不少人对能否击退国民党反动派的进攻缺乏信心，对战争的前途表示忧虑。在此紧要关头，党和人民的英明领袖、中国革命的伟大舵手毛泽东同志，提出了“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的著名论点。他指出：“看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”①毛泽东同志的英明论断，武装了中国人民的思想，增强了战胜蒋介石的信心和勇气，对于动员全国人民奋起以革命战争粉碎美蒋反动派发动的反革命战争起了极其伟大的作用。后来，毛泽东同志根据对敌我力量的马克思列宁主义的深刻分析，更进一步预言：用五年左右的时间可能从根本上打倒国民党。这一预言变成伟大的号召，大大地鼓舞了军队和人民的革命热情，进一步发挥了人民群众的无穷的力量，结果使这一预言提前实现。中国人民解放军在全国人民的全力支援下，经过三年半的英勇战斗，消灭了蒋介石反动军队八百多万人，终于取得了革命战争的胜利。
    由此可见，毛泽东同志指出一切反动派都是纸老虎，指出蒋军必败，我军必胜，教导我们在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人，要敢于胜利，善于斗争，表明了毛泽东同志对人民群众的力量和作用的最大的信心，表明了毛泽东同志相信群众、依靠群众的坚定的马克思列宁主义的立场。
    马克思列宁主义认为：战争是阶级社会的一种历史现象，是阶级斗争的最尖锐的形式。战争的胜负，主要地不决定于一时的军事力量的优势，更不是单由一两件新式武器所决定的。毛泽东同志早就说过：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”②而人心的向背，又是与战争的性质分不开的，是战争中经常起作用的因素。一切反革命战争，都是非正义的战争，这种战争是反人民的，因而就必然脱离人民，为人民所反对；一切革命的战争，都是正义的战争，这种战争是与人民的利益一致的，因而也就必然为人民所拥护和支持。当国民党反动派在美帝国主义指使和帮助下发动大规模内战的时候，虽然它在军事力量上占着优势，但是战争的非正义性引起了全国人民的反对，却成了它的致命的弱点；而中国人民解放军虽然在数量上和装备上暂时处于劣势，但是战争的正义性、广大人民群众的同情和支持，就使解放军在政治上处于绝对的优势。正如毛泽东同志所说：“蒋介石军事力量的优势，只是暂时的现象，只是临时起作用的因素；美国帝国主义的援助，也只是临时起作用的因素；蒋介石战争的反人民的性质，人心的向背，则是经常起作用的因素；而在这方面，人民解放军则占着优势。人民解放军的战争所具有的爱国的正义的革命的性质，必然要获得全国人民的拥护。这就是战胜蒋介石的政治基础。”③
    由于革命的正义的战争与广大人民群众的利益相一致、为广大人民群众所拥护，因而就有了取得最后胜利的可能性。但是，要使这种可能性转化为现实，还必须善于利用这种条件，把广大的人民群众充分地动员和组织起来，直接或间接地参加和支持革命战争。这样，战争的主观指导的正确与否，就有了决定的意义。同是革命的正义的战争，却往往出现两种不同的情况：一种情况，是害怕或者不相信人民群众的力量，不敢或不肯充分地动员广大人民群众起来参加战争；另一种情况，则是充分地信赖和依靠人民群众，尽一切努力最大程度地发动和组织人民群众，进行广泛的人民战争。对待人民群众的两种不同的态度，形成了资产阶级革命家和无产阶级革命家的分水岭，是马克思列宁主义与右倾机会主义的一个根本分歧，在中国革命历史上，长期以来存在的资产阶级军事路线同无产阶级军事路线的斗争，集中地表现了对待人民群众的两种根本不同的态度。毛泽东同志对中国革命战争的伟大贡献，就在于他作为一个杰出的无产阶级革命家，运用马克思列宁主义指导中国革命战争的实际，彻底地解决了如何充分地发动和组织人民群众参加到革命战争中来，进行最广泛的人民战争这样一个根本问题，他规定和坚持了马克思列宁主义的正确的军事路线，与资产阶级军事路线进行了不调和的斗争，引导中国人民革命战争步步走向胜利。
    毛泽东同志早就说过：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”④他又说：“如果要把几十年来的革命做一个总结，那就是……要打倒帝国主义和封建主义，只有把占全国人口百分之九十的工农大众动员起来，组织起来，才有可能。”⑤在第三次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志又一再强调必须放手发动群众，坚决地团结起全国百分之九十以上的人民大众争取一切可能争取的人，结成广泛的统一战线，把反动派最大程度地孤立起来，以便打倒反动派。这个统一战线，包括工人、农民、城市小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、开明绅士、其他爱国分子、少数民族和海外华侨等等。毛泽东同志不仅号召全党经常地注意做群众工作，把动员广大人民群众参加革命战争，作为党在战争期间的一项根本任务；而且，他还教导中国人民解放军“人人学会歼灭敌人、唤起民众两套本领，亲密团结群众”，⑥只有这样，才能使人民解放军的威力无敌于天下。
    要使广大的人民群众参加和支持革命战争，必须是依靠群众的革命的自觉性，而不是依靠领导者的发号施令。毛泽东同志在1948年4月2日对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话中说：“我党二十几年来，天天做群众工作，近十几年来，天天讲群众路线。我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”⑦在战争中，在前线上，中国人民解放军以无比的英雄气概，用劣势装备打击优势装备的敌人，不怕任何艰难困苦，英勇顽强、前仆后继地战斗；在后方，广大人民群众送子送夫参加军队，运粮草、派担架支援前线，在人力和物力上全力支援战争；在敌人所到之处，广大人民组织起来，拿起一切可以使用的武器，用各种可能的方式，打击敌人，配合正面作战；全国人民，在各个不同的战线，一致对敌人进行坚决的斗争。所有这一切，都表现了在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，全国人民的高度的革命自觉性。反动派总是诬蔑我们这种广泛的深入的群众运动，把它说成是共产党的“强迫”，其实，任何的强迫都不可能出现这样的群众运动，这是他们永远不会去了解也永远不能够了解的。毛泽东同志教导我们：“马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗。”⑧从这个原则出发，我们党一贯地重视启发人民群众的自觉性，提高人民群众的政治觉悟；同时，我们党的政策和方针，不仅使领导者知道，而且使广大群众都知道，以便使其成为群众的自觉的行动。
    总之，毛泽东同志在指导中国革命战争中，坚定地信守这样一条马克思列宁主义的客观真理：人民是历史的创造者，真正的历史是人民群众的历史，没有人民群众的生产斗争和社会斗争，社会就不能存在和发展。人民身上的枷锁，只有依靠人民群众自己的双手来打破；人民的幸福生活，只有依靠人民群众自己的双手来创造；一切革命事业，只有依靠人民群众自己的斗争，才能获得成功。正如毛泽东同志所说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”⑨这就是毛泽东同志的人民战争思想的根本出发点。
    主力兵团与地方兵团相结合、正规军与民兵相结合、武装的群众与非武装的群众相结合
    毛泽东同志的人民战争思想的中心内容，就是实行全民武装、全民皆兵。就是说，一方面要组织起一支人民的军队，作为进行人民战争的骨干力量和打击敌人的主要工具，这支军队忠实地为人民服务和它与人民群众的亲密关系，是它的力量的源泉；另一方面，广泛地建立人民群众的武装组织，把一切可以组织起来的人，在自愿的、民主的和不脱离生产的原则下组织起来，拿起一切可以使用的武器，直接参加武装斗争，配合军队作战。而这种人民武装组织的最好的形式就是民兵。军队和民兵同时并举，互相配合，这是毛泽东同志所说的“两条腿走路”的方针在人民战争中的具体运用。
    党和毛泽东同志所缔造和培育的中国人民解放军就是上面所说的这样一支人民的军队。这支军队来自人民，与广大人民群众有着水乳相融、血肉相联的关系，它紧紧地和人民站在一起，全心全意服务于人民。这支军队是在党的绝对领导之下，军队的领导制度是党委集体领导下的首长分工负责制，军队中有坚强的政治工作，——这是人民军队的生命线；这支军队实行军民一致的原则，处处爱护人民的利益，它不但是战斗队，而且是工作队、生产队；这支军队在内部实行官兵一致、上下一致的原则，实行三大民主，即政治民主、军事民主和经济民主，实行集中和民主相结合、上级的统一领导和下级的积极性创造性相结合的原则。实行了这些马克思列宁主义的建军原则，就使这支军队与人民群众永远保持亲密的关系，为广大人民群众所衷心拥护和全力支持。实行了这些原则，就使这支军队内部具有钢铁一般的团结、具有无穷的智慧和创造力，具有勇猛顽强、一往直前的战斗精神。在第三次国内革命战争中，在进行轰轰烈烈的土地改革运动和整党运动的同时，中国人民解放军进行了具有伟大意义的新式整军运动。这个新式整军运动是用“诉苦”（即诉旧社会和反动派给予劳动人民之苦）和“三查”（查阶级、查工作、查斗志）、“三整”（整顿组织、整顿思想、整顿作风）的方法进行的。这是一个群众性的自我教育的运动，是军队内部一次大规模的民主运动。这一新式整军运动是在毛泽东同志的建军思想指导下，我军政治工作和民主运动的一个重要发展。这次整军运动大大提高了全体官兵的政治觉悟和战斗意志，加速了对补充到解放军的大批被俘的国民党军队士兵的改造过程；同时，纯洁和巩固了部队的组织，加强了部队的组织性和纪律性，进一步发扬了军队的政治民主、军事民主和经济民主，对于中国人民解放军的发展壮大和作战的胜利起了巨大的作用。特别是在训练中官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵，互教互学，在作战中战前开“诸葛亮会”，有领导地发动群众讨论如何完成作战任务，战后进行民主战评，总结和检查作战经验与教训，这些作法充分地发挥了广大士兵的积极性，发挥了集体的智慧和力量，有效地保证了战斗的胜利。同时，也突出地表现了人民军队、人民战争的特征。
    为了进行人民战争，打败强大的敌人，中国人民解放军从来都是把自己划分为主力兵团和地方兵团两部分。主力兵团是中国人民解放军的骨干和精锐，可以随时执行超地方性的作战任务，在地方兵团和民兵的配合下，进行大规模的战役和战斗。地方兵团则固定于一定地区，保卫地方和打击当地的敌人。地方兵团包括了一部分正规的或较正规的部队，又包括了大量的分散的县、区游击队。地方兵团还组织许多经过良好训练的、善于进行军事、政治和民运各种工作的、短小精干的武装工作队，深入敌人后方，打击敌人，发动和组织人民群众进行革命斗争，配合正面战线的作战。建立这样的地方兵团好处很多：第一、地方兵团土生土长，与当地人民有密切的联系，熟悉当地的地理环境、民情风俗，便于同当地的人民群众打成一片，使军队更易于在当地人民中生根，取得人民群众的真心拥护。第二、建立有固定的地区的地方兵团，便于在当地的党和政府的统一领导下，把武装斗争同其它各种必要的斗争形式紧密结合起来，巩固和扩大革命根据地。第三、地方兵团担负着培养和训练民兵的任务，便于发展人民武装；同时，地方兵团又是广大民兵对敌斗争的骨干。第四、地方兵团又是主力兵团的有力助手和坚强的后备队，担负着配合主力军作战的任务，在一定的条件下集结起来与主力军协同作战，共同打击和歼灭敌人，当它在执行各种任务中锻炼得愈益坚强，逐渐提高到了主力军的水准，在必要时就可以转化为主力兵团去执行更大的任务。在长期的革命战争中，毛泽东同志一贯地极为重视这两部分军队的建设，反对那种只看重主力兵团，不重视地方兵团的偏向；而且，在必要的情况下，还实施主力军地方化、群众化的原则，达到有利的分散。在抗日战争胜利以后，当国民党反动派在美帝国主义援助下以海陆空三路向东北大举运兵，东北地区面临严重斗争的时候，毛泽东同志预见到东北地区革命斗争的艰苦性，及时地指示了正确的方针，并且指出：“迅速在西满、东满、北满划分军区和军分区，将军队划分为野战军和地方军。将正规军队的相当部分，分散到各军分区去，从事发动群众，消灭土匪，建立政权，组织游击队、民兵和自卫军，以便稳固地方，配合野战军，粉碎国民党的进攻。一切军队，均须有确定的地区和任务，才能迅速和人民结合起来，建立巩固的根据地。”⑩后来的事实完全证明了这些指示的正确。
    中国人民在长期的革命战争中，在毛泽东军事思想的指导下，不仅建设了一支在共产党领导下的强大的人民军队，而且又建设了一支在共产党领导下的强大的民兵队伍。在历次革命战争中，毛泽东同志一向把建立人民群众武装，广泛地发展人民群众的武装斗争，作为一项巨大的战略任务。随着革命形势的不断发展和革命根据地的不断扩大，这支广大的群众武装队伍日益壮大，组织日益完善，到抗日战争胜利结束的时候，已经发展成为拥有二百余万人的巨大力量。在第三次国内革命战争中，为了粉碎国民党反动派的进攻，解放全中国，各个解放区根据党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，进一步迅速地发展和扩大了民兵组织。这支广大的人民群众的武装组织，在革命战争中发挥了极其伟大的作用，有力地保证了战争的胜利。民兵，是人民军队的得力助手。它人熟地熟，分布广泛，便于广泛地开展游击战争，神出鬼没地进行麻雀战、围困战、地雷战、破击战，到处袭击敌人，给敌人以困扰、疲惫、消耗和杀伤；它站岗放哨，封锁消息，使敌人变成聋子瞎子；它侦察敌情，送情报、当向导，使我军变成“千里眼”、“顺风耳”。在必要时则集中起来，大规模地支援和配合军队的大兵团作战，例如第三次国内革命战争中，民兵成师成团地长期随军远征，担负各种战争勤务，在著名的淮海战役中，随军进行各种战争勤务的民兵即达二百万人，有力地保证了这一伟大战役的胜利。民兵，是人民军队的强大的后备力量，是“寓兵于民”的最好的办法，是人民战争在人力方面的雄厚的基础。在战争中，根据战争的需要，在党和人民政府的号召下，民兵总是自觉自愿地成批地参加军队，不断地壮大了人民军队的力量。由于民兵早已经过一定的训练和实际战斗的锻炼，一经入伍，很快就成为军队中坚强的战斗力量。民兵，是维护社会治安、镇压反革命的重要力量，是巩固人民民主专政的一种重要工具。有了民兵，可以保证我军后方的巩固，使前线部队无后顾之忧而全力作战。民兵，又是革命根据地生产建设的骨干力量，是人民群众的一种很好的教育组织。中国革命战争的胜利，是与民兵的伟大作用分不开的，而民兵的伟大作用，又极其生动地体现了革命战争的人民性和人民战争的广泛性。
    此外，人民群众中的一切非武装组织，如工人的、农民的、青年的、妇女的、文化的和其它职业和工作的各种人民团体，都在党和政府的统一领导下，进行支援战争、援助军队的各种工作，包括动员人民参加军队，优待军人家属，帮助军队解决各种物质困难，替军队运送给养、弹药和各种军用物资，破坏敌人的交通以阻止敌人的进攻，为我军修桥筑路，帮助我大军顺利开进以歼灭敌人，站岗放哨，除奸肃特，瓦解敌军，侦察敌情，封锁消息，救护和运送伤兵，到前线进行慰问和鼓动工作，直到和游击队、民兵协同进行爆破运动和袭击敌人，用一切可能的力量和一切可行的方式，直接或间接地帮助军队作战。同时，解放区的全体人民热烈从事政治、经济、文化等各项建设事业，特别是尽一切努力发展生产，以便保障军需民用，支持长期的战争。总之，一切为了前线，一切为了战争的胜利，就是解放区全体军民的总口号、总方针。
    主力兵团、地方兵团、民兵，汇成武装的洪流，加上非武装的人民群众的全力支持，就使任何强大的敌人都不能抵挡。正如毛泽东同志所说：“使它像一匹野牛冲入火阵，我们一声唤也要把它吓一大跳，这匹野牛就非烧死不可。”?
