Xinhua News Agency, November 11th, Washington Dispatch: According to the US Department of Labor's announcement on the 10th, the number of unemployed people in the United States increased by 191,000 in October. The total number of unemployed nationwide has reached 3,579,000, of which the number of long-term unemployed (i.e., unemployed for more than fifteen weeks) has increased to nearly one million.

Under normal circumstances, October is a season of increased employment in the United States, generally adding 400,000 jobs. Now, due to the increase in the number of unemployed in October, the proportion of the national unemployment rate in the national labor force has risen from 5.7% in September to 6.4%. This is the highest rate since September 1958.

Wolfbein, Director of the Bureau of Manpower of the Department of Labor, said in a speech that the reason for the increase in unemployment in October was the decline in business activity and the stagnation of steel production. Wolfbein also said that if the current trend continues, the number of unemployed in the United States will reach more than five million by January and February next year. (Attached picture)

    就业旺季不见就业情况好转
    美国十月份失业人数增加
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：据美国劳工部10日宣布，美国的失业人数在10月份增加了十九万一千人，全国失业人数已增加到三百五十七万九千人，其中长期失业（即失业十五个星期以上）人数已增加到将近一百万。
    在通常的情况下，10月份是美国就业增加的季节，一般要增加四十万人的就业。现在，由于10月份失业人数增加，全国失业人数所占全国劳动力的比例，已从9月份的5.7％，上升到6.4％。这是1958年9月以来最高的比率。
    劳工部人力总局局长沃尔夫宾在一次谈话中认为，10月份失业人数增加的原因是企业活动下降和钢铁生产停滞。沃尔夫宾还说，如果目前的趋势继续下去，美国的失业人数到明年1、2月间将会达到五百多万。（附图片）
