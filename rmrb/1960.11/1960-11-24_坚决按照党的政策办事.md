    Resolutely Act in Accordance with the Party's Policies
      Correctly Implement the Party's Policies Among the Masses
    Among the Party's various policies of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, further adjusting the production relations of rural people's communes and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the peasant masses are pressing issues to be resolved in the countryside. Resolutely implementing the three-level ownership system of the commune based on the production team is the core and soul of resolving the issue of production relations. Adjusting production relations and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses run like a red thread through the Party's policies of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. We should, in accordance with this general spirit, and in light of the practical experience of the past two years, conscientiously study the Party's policies of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and review the central government's instructions and resolutions concerning rural people's communes. Under the premise of holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and affirming the great achievements of the past three years, we should earnestly summarize experiences, promote strengths, overcome shortcomings, and improve our work. Only in this way can every Party member and cadre consciously, loyally, and unreservedly implement the Party's policies to the end, and avoid or reduce mistakes in future work.
    To correctly implement the Party's policies among the masses and make them play an active role in actual production and life, it is necessary to proceed from the actual conditions of the time and place and concretize the policies. That is to say, it is necessary to systematically study the situation and closely integrate the Party's policy provisions with the specific practices of the time and place. The actual conditions in different regions vary and are constantly developing and changing. In different situations, or due to significant changes in the situation, as long as it conforms to the Party's policy principles, some supplementary regulations and implementation methods can be formulated after reporting to and obtaining permission from the higher Party organization. This is precisely the concretization of the Party's policies and the flexibility of the Party's policies. However, it should be emphasized that the policies of the Party Central Committee are a summary of the practical experience and requirements of the masses, and are the general guiding principles for the work of the whole country. They must be treated seriously and resolutely implemented, and no one is allowed to outwardly agree but inwardly oppose them or arbitrarily distort them. The so-called concretization of policies is to better implement the Party's policy principles, and no one is allowed to use the excuse of special circumstances to violate or distort the Party's policy principles and specific provisions, play any new tricks, seek novelty, or tamper with the direction pointed out by the Party. Any behavior that distorts or violates the Party's policies must be resolutely fought against, and thoroughly prevented and corrected; because protecting the Party's policies is protecting the Party's life.
    The Party's policies of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production include many aspects such as production relations, measures to increase production, the lives of the masses, and working methods. These policies undoubtedly must be resolutely and fully implemented. However, in the specific implementation, it is impossible to solve all the problems at once regardless of the primary and secondary, or the urgent and less urgent. We must implement them step by step, with a plan, in a measured way, with varying degrees of emphasis, according to different situations. First of all, we should seize the most urgent problems in the production and life of the masses and solve them. We must publicize, implement, and deliver simultaneously to achieve immediate results. In the current month or so, in terms of production and life, we should prominently focus on the following three tasks: focus on arranging life, with grain arrangement as the center; focus on current production, with the implementation of the "three guarantees" and the fulfillment of rewards and penalties as the center; focus on continuing to strengthen and consolidate the forefront of agricultural production, with continuing to delegate cadres and concentrate labor as the center. Doing these three things well will lay a solid foundation for winning a bumper harvest next year, taking the initiative in various tasks, and creating extremely favorable conditions for further comprehensively implementing the Party's policies of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. On the basis of properly arranging current production and the lives of the masses, we should take advantage of the situation and quickly shift the focus to implementing a series of Party policies regarding the three-level ownership system of the people's commune based on the production team. This is the most fundamental and core link in all our work, and it is the decisive key to winning a bumper harvest next year. We must do our best to grasp it well and deliver on it one by one.
    To implement the Party's policies of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, as in the past, we must boldly mobilize the masses and rely on the masses. The more extensive, in-depth, and full the mobilization of the masses, the more comprehensive, thorough, and correct the implementation of the policies. Vigorously developing agriculture and grain production is the cause of the whole people, and it is up to the whole people to do it. Therefore, policies must be implemented by the masses. The Party's policies are the revolutionary policies of the proletariat. Among the broad masses of peasants, poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants are the strongest pillars of the socialist cause. We must adhere to the Party's class line and mass line, and under the leadership of the Party, closely rely on and mobilize poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, and unite the vast majority of peasants to implement the Party's policies. We must use the method of combining rooting and linking with extensive mobilization, and the method of mobilizing at all levels, to organize a vigorous mass movement. We must repeatedly and in detail read and explain the Party's policies of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production to the broad masses, so that every household knows and everyone, young and old, knows. In particular, it is necessary to enable the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants to truly understand and grasp the Party's policies, mobilize them to speak out freely and examine the work of cadres at all levels, humbly and patiently listen to their opinions and requirements, rely on them to understand and inspect the implementation of the Party's policies, and supervise Party members and cadres to conscientiously and unreservedly implement the Party's policies. Only under the conditions of fully carrying out and doing these tasks well can the implementation of the Party's policies have the most reliable mass base, and can the Party's policies be guaranteed to be implemented and delivered with the active support and persistent struggle of the vast majority of the masses.
      (Excerpt from the fifth issue of "New Hunan Review," "Boldly Mobilize the Masses and Conscientiously Implement the Party's Policies")
    Policies and Tasks are a Dialectical Unity
    The Party's policies are the life of the Party. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary cadre must deeply understand this issue. As everyone knows, the ultimate goal of our Party's revolution is to build a communist society in our country. To build such a happy and fulfilling society, we mainly rely on the joint efforts of the broad masses of the people under the correct leadership of the Communist Party. Neither is dispensable. Because the people are the creators of history and are the forces that play a decisive role in building socialist and communist society. Anyone who does not recognize this is not a historical materialist. However, without the leadership of the Communist Party, it is impossible for the people to build socialism and communism. Because the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of any people cannot be exerted spontaneously, and no real mass movement comes about spontaneously. The level of awareness of the masses can only be gradually improved with the correct leadership of the Communist Party, and the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the masses can only be fully exerted under the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party's leadership over the people includes many aspects, and the most important one is to rely on all our Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres to correctly publicize and implement the Party's various policies, so that the broad masses can conduct effective struggles to achieve their political goals under the guidance of our Party's policy and ideology. Because the various policies formulated by our Party Central Committee in each period reflect the needs of social production development and the urgent demands of the broad masses. Only by acting in accordance with the Party's policies can the Party's various tasks advance along the correct path. Conversely, if we deviate from the Party's policies, it is equivalent to losing the Party's leadership, losing our way, and producing "left" or right errors.
    The Party's policies are the life of the Party, also because the Party's various policies are formulated based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, and based on actual conditions. Therefore, it most directly and concentratedly embodies the fundamental interests of the proletariat and other working people. It correctly combines the needs of the state, the collective, and the individual, the long-term interests and the current interests, the overall interests and the partial interests, and the collective interests and the individual interests, and concentratedly embodies the highest interests of the broadest masses of the people. Therefore, in all the work of the Party, as long as we correctly implement the Party's policies, we can mobilize and unite the greatest enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people to victoriously complete the Party's various tasks. Therefore, the Party's policies are the guiding principles for all our cadres to carry out their work. We must conscientiously understand the spirit and essence of the various policies, use policy ideology to arm our minds, and conscientiously and seriously act in accordance with the Party's policies.
    To act in accordance with the Party's policies, we must clarify the consistency of policies and tasks, and oppose the erroneous view that puts policies and tasks in opposition to each other, only talking about tasks but not about policies. We often hear some comrades say: "To complete the task, we cannot implement the policy; to implement the policy, we cannot complete the task." Obviously, this is a view that puts policies and tasks in opposition to each other. We also often see that some comrades, although they do not openly say "we want tasks but not policies," in their actual work, they always feel that implementing policies is too troublesome. In order to complete the task, they ignore the policies and replace them with feelings. Because these comrades put the Party's policies and tasks in opposition to each other, they do not pay attention to publicizing the Party's policies in their work, resulting in detours in their work and turning good things into bad things. This practice of putting policies and tasks in opposition to each other is very wrong. We know that the Party's policies and tasks are consistent. Policies and tasks are two aspects of the same thing, which are interconnected and inseparable. No matter what work we are doing, we must have a positive and reliable plan. To ensure the completion of our tasks, we need to carry out work in all aspects. However, a very important point is to rely on the conscientious and correct implementation of the Party's relevant policies. The so-called guarantee role of policies for tasks, on the one hand, is manifested in that it is the basis for our handling of problems and the standard for measuring whether we have correctly and completely completed the task; on the other hand, because the Party's policies come from the masses, they represent the most fundamental interests of the broad masses. Through the implementation of policies, we can improve the political awareness of the masses and enable the broad masses to act under the guidance of unified policy ideology. Therefore, from the relationship between policies and tasks, policies serve the Party's political tasks, and the completion of the Party's tasks depends on the correct implementation of policies. However, it is not enough to understand the consistency of policies and tasks in this way alone. We must also see that policies not only passively serve tasks, but also have a huge active role in tasks. Because all human actions are dominated by ideology, if the ideology is correct, the ideological understanding is consistent with the objective, and people's actions will be correct. The completion of our various tasks depends on mobilizing the masses under the guidance of correct policy ideology. The degree of clarity of policy ideology often determines the degree of completion of the task. If we are very clear about the policies related to a certain task, we are very clear about many policy boundaries, and we have investigated and studied the objective situation, we will definitely correctly grasp the policies and exert the power of the policies, so that the task can be completed according to plan.
      (Excerpt from Zhang Ziming's "Conscientiously Implement the Party's Policies" in the November 22nd "Dazhong Daily")
        The Better the Policies are Implemented, the Better the Tasks are Completed
    As early as 1941, Chairman Mao said: "The basic tasks of the Communist Party's leading organs lie in understanding the situation and grasping the two major tasks of policies. The former is what is called understanding the world, and the latter is what is called transforming the world." Later, he said: "Only when the Party's policies and tactics are all on the right track can the Chinese revolution be possible to win. Policies and tactics are the life of the Party, and leading comrades at all levels must pay full attention to them and must not be careless." Chairman Mao raised the Party's policies to the height of "the life of the Party" and raised the implementation of the Party's policies to the height of "transforming the world" and determining the success or failure of the Chinese revolution to educate us. It can be seen how important the Party's policies and its correct implementation are to realizing the Party's political line and ensuring the smooth development of the revolutionary and construction cause.
    It is precisely because the Party's policies have such a huge role and power that the broad masses of cadres and the masses have drawn such a conclusion from their own personal experience: "We must act in accordance with the Party's policies." The great victory that our Party has led the Chinese people to achieve is the victory of the Party's policies. However, in actual work, there are still a few cadres who do not have a strong sense of policy, do not act in accordance with the Party's policies, or do not act completely in accordance with the Party's policies, which has brought some undue losses to the work. Among these comrades, some also put forward many "reasons" to justify their erroneous thoughts and behaviors.
    "When the task is loose, we can conscientiously implement the policies. When the task is urgent, where is there time to carefully implement the policies?" Some people hold this erroneous view and do not conscientiously implement the Party's policies. These comrades have not figured out the dialectical relationship between tasks and policies ideologically. They metaphysically regard tasks and policies as opposing each other. It seems that to complete the task quickly, we cannot carefully implement the policies; to carefully implement the policies, we cannot complete the task quickly. In fact, tasks and policies are completely consistent. Policies serve tasks, and tasks are completed by policies. Therefore, only by correctly implementing the policies can we complete the task well; the better the policies are implemented, the better the task is completed. This is because any work we do is the masses' own business, and any policy of our Party is a concentrated expression of the masses' interests. Because of this, as long as we explain the policies and principles to the masses clearly, so that the masses not only know "what it is," but also know "why it is," people's enthusiasm and creativity can be fully exerted, and they will consciously complete the task. Chairman Mao said: "When the masses know the truth and have a common purpose, they will work together. ... When the masses are united, everything is easy to handle." In our actual work, many comrades have also personally experienced that: conscientiously and carefully implementing the Party's policies seems troublesome, but it is actually time-saving; thinking about it is slow, but doing it is fast. It can be seen from this that the more arduous the task and the more urgent the time, the more seriously and conscientiously we must implement the Party's policies.
    Some people also use the excuse of "special circumstances" to not seriously implement the Party's policies. They only emphasize "special" and do not emphasize unity, only talk about flexibility and do not talk about principle. These comrades do not understand the dialectical relationship between the two and regard being responsible to the Party and being responsible to the masses as opposing each other. We believe that the principle of the Party's policies and the flexibility in specific implementation, being responsible to the Party and being responsible to the people are completely consistent. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once said: "Apart from the interests of the people, the Party has no special interests of its own. The greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people are the highest standard of truth, that is, the highest standard for all actions of our Party members. Every Party member is responsible to the people, that is, responsible to the Party. Being irresponsible to the people is the most irresponsible to the Party. We must understand the consistency between being responsible to the Party and being responsible to the people, and we must unify the two and not separate or oppose the two." Therefore, in the process of specifically implementing the Party's policies, as long as it is to better implement the Party's policy principles, as long as it is for the "greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people," it is allowed to be somewhat flexible based on the actual conditions and conditions of the local area. Doing so is beneficial to the Party and the people. However, at the same time, we must also recognize that the Party's policies are the criteria for unifying the will and actions of the entire Party, that is to say, any behavior that does not conscientiously implement the Party's policies under the pretext of "special circumstances" or "flexible application" is "undermining Party discipline and unity" and harming "the fundamental interests of the Chinese people." Therefore, they should be resolutely opposed and quickly overcome.

    坚决按照党的政策办事
      把党的政策正确地贯彻到群众中去
    在党的大办农业、大办粮食的各项政策中，进一步调整农村人民公社的生产关系，充分发挥农民群众的积极性，是当前农村中迫切需要解决的问题。而坚决贯彻执行以队为基础的公社三级所有制，则是解决生产关系问题的核心和灵魂。调整生产关系、调动群众积极性，像一条红线一样贯穿在党的大办农业、大办粮食的政策中。我们应该按照这条总精神，联系两年的实践经验，认真地学习党的大办农业、大办粮食的政策，重温中央历次有关农村人民公社的指示和决议。在高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗、肯定三年伟大成绩的前提下，认真地总结经验，发扬优点，克服缺点，改进工作。这样，才能使每个党员和干部自觉地、忠诚地、不折不扣地将党的政策贯彻到底，并在今后工作中不犯或少犯错误。
    要把党的政策正确地贯彻到群众中去，在生产、生活的实际中发挥积极作用，必须从当时当地的实际情况出发，把政策具体化。这就是说，要系统地研究情况，把党的政策规定和当时当地的具体实践紧密结合起来。各个地区的实际情况是存在着差别的，是在不断发展变化的。在不同的情况下，或者由于情况发生显著变化，只要符合党的政策原则，在报请上级党组织准许以后，可以作出若干补充规定和实施办法，这正是党的政策的具体化，党的政策的灵活性。但是，应该着重指出，党中央的政策是群众实践经验和要求的概括，是全国工作的普遍指导原则，必须严肃对待，坚决执行，决不允许阳奉阴违，任意曲解。所谓把政策具体化，是为了更好地贯彻党的政策原则，决不允许借口情况特殊，违反、歪曲党的政策原则和具体规定，玩什么新花样，标新立异，篡改党所指引的方向。对于任何歪曲、违反党的政策的行为，要坚决地开展斗争，彻底防止和纠正；因为保护党的政策，就是保卫党的生命。
    党的大办农业、大办粮食的政策，包括了生产关系、增产措施、群众生活和工作方法等许多方面。这些政策无疑地都是要坚决全部贯彻兑现的。但是在具体贯彻执行的时候，不能不分主次、不分缓急地要求把全部问题一下解决，而必须分别不同情况，有计划、有步骤、有缓有急、有重有轻地逐步贯彻。首先应当抓住当前群众生产、生活中最紧迫的问题加以解决。边宣传，边执行，边兑现，才能起到立竿见影的效果。在当前一个月左右的时间内，在生产、生活方面，应该突出地抓住以下三项：抓生活安排，中心是粮食安排；抓当前生产，中心是“三包”落实，奖罚兑现；抓继续加强和巩固农业生产第一线，中心是继续下放干部和集中劳动力。这三项抓好了，就为夺取明年大丰收奠定了坚实的基础，取得各项工作的主动，并且为进一步全面贯彻执行党的大办农业、大办粮食的政策，创造极为有利的条件。在当前生产和群众生活作了妥善安排的基础上，就应该因势利导，把重点迅速转向贯彻执行党的关于人民公社以队为基础的三级所有制的一系列政策。这是我们全部工作中最根本最核心的一环，是关系明年夺取大丰收的决定关键，一定要全力抓好，一条条地全部兑现。
    贯彻执行党的大办农业、大办粮食的政策，如同既往一样，必须放手发动群众，依靠群众。群众发动得越广泛、深入、充分，政策就贯彻执行得越全面、彻底、正确。大办农业、大办粮食，是全民的事业，靠全民来办，政策也就必须靠群众来贯彻执行。党的政策是无产阶级的革命政策；在广大的农民群众中，贫农、新老下中农是社会主义事业最坚强的支柱。必须坚持党的阶级路线和群众路线，在党的领导下，紧紧地依靠和发动贫农、新老下中农，团结最大多数农民群众起来贯彻执行党的政策。要用扎根串连和广泛发动相结合的方法，层层发动的方法，组织一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动。要反复地、详尽地向广大群众宣读解释党的大办农业、大办粮食的政策，作到家喻户晓，老少皆知。特别是要使广大的贫农、下中农真正领会和掌握党的政策，发动他们大鸣大放，检查各级干部的工作，虚心耐心地倾听他们的意见和要求，依靠他们了解和检查党的政策执行情况，监督党员和干部认真地、不折不扣地贯彻执行党的政策。在充分地进行了、做好了这些工作的条件下，党的政策的贯彻执行才有最可靠的群众基础，党的政策才能在最大多数群众的积极支持和坚持斗争的情况下，保证贯彻兑现。
      （摘自《新湘评论》第五期《放手发动群众，认真贯彻执行党的政策》）
    政策和任务是辩证的统一
    党的政策就是党的生命。对于这个问题，每个共产党员和革命干部都必须深刻理解。大家知道，我们党进行革命的最终目的，是要在我国建成共产主义社会。要建成这样一个幸福美满的社会，主要的依靠广大人民群众在共产党的正确领导下共同奋斗。两者缺一不可。因为人民群众是历史的创造者，是建成社会主义和共产主义社会起决定作用的力量，谁认识不到这一点，那就不是历史唯物主义者。但是人民群众没有共产党的领导，也是不可能建成社会主义和共产主义的。因为任何人民群众的革命积极性和创造性，都不是自发的发挥作用的，任何真正的群众运动都不是自流到来的。群众的觉悟水平，是靠共产党的正确领导才能逐步提高的，群众的革命积极性和创造性，是要靠共产党的领导才能得到充分发挥。共产党对人民群众的领导是包括多方面的，其中最重要的一项，就是依靠我们全体共产党员和革命干部正确地宣传和贯彻执行党的各项政策，使广大群众在我们党的政策思想指导之下，为实现自己的政治目的进行有成效的斗争。因为我党中央每个时期所制订的各项政策，都是反映了社会生产发展的需要，广大群众迫切的要求，只有按照党的政策办事，才能使党的各项工作沿着正确的道路前进。反之，如果离开了党的政策，就等于失去了党的领导，迷失了方向，产生或“左”或右的错误。
    党的政策就是党的生命，还在于党的各项政策是根据马克思列宁主义的原则，集中了群众的智慧，根据实际情况而制订的。因此，它最直接、最集中地体现了无产阶级及其他劳动人民的根本利益，它把国家、集体、个人三方面的需要，把长远利益和目前利益、整体利益和局部利益、集体利益和个人利益正确地结合起来，集中地体现了最广大人民群众的最高利益。因此，在党的一切工作中，只要正确地贯彻执行党的政策，就能够动员和团结广大人民群众的最大积极性来胜利完成党的各项任务。所以党的政策是我们一切干部进行工作的指针。必须认真地领会各项政策的精神与实质，用政策思想来武装我们的头脑，认真地严肃地按照党的政策办事。
    按照党的政策办事，必须明确政策和任务的一致性，反对那种把政策和任务对立起来，只讲任务，不讲政策的错误观点。我们常常听到有的同志说：“要完成任务，就不能贯彻政策；要贯彻政策，就不能完成任务。”很显然，这是把政策与任务互相对立的看法。我们也常常看到，有的同志虽然不是公开说“要任务不要政策”，可是在实际工作中，总是嫌贯彻政策太麻烦，为了完成任务，就不管政策，以感想代替政策。由于这些同志把党的政策和任务对立起来，因此在工作中，就不注意宣传党的政策，结果使工作走了弯路，把好事办成了坏事。这种把政策和任务对立起来的作法是非常错误的。我们知道，党的政策和任务是一致的。政策和任务是一件事情的两方面，是互相联系而不可分割的。我们无论进行那项工作，都必须有一个积极可靠的计划。要保证我们的任务完成，是需要从各方面进行工作的。但是，很重要的一条，就是要靠认真地正确地贯彻执行党的有关政策，所谓政策对任务的保证作用，一方面表现在，它是我们处理问题的依据，是衡量我们是否正确完满地完成任务的标准；另一方面，因为党的政策是从群众中来的，它代表着广大群众的最根本的利益，通过政策的贯彻，就能提高群众的政治觉悟，使广大群众在统一的政策思想指导下行动起来。因此，从政策与任务的关系上来说，政策是为党的政治任务服务的，党的任务的完成，有赖于政策的正确贯彻执行。但是，政策与任务的一致性，仅仅这样去理解还是不够的。还必须看到政策不光是被动地为任务服务，政策对于任务还有着巨大的能动作用。因为人们的一切行动是由思想支配的，思想正确了，思想认识与客观一致了，人的行动就会正确。我们各项任务的完成，都是依靠在正确的政策思想指导下，去发动群众完成的。政策思想的明确程度，往往决定着任务完成的程度。如果我们对于某一项任务有关的政策，都搞得很明确，许多政策界限都搞得很清楚，又对客观情况有了调查研究，我们就一定会正确地掌握政策，发挥政策的威力，使任务按计划完成。
      （摘自11月22日《大众日报》张子明：《认真地贯彻执行党的政策》）
        政策贯彻的越好任务完成的就越好
    毛主席早在1941年就说过：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界。”后来他又说：“只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”毛主席把党的政策提到“党的生命”的高度，把贯彻执行党的政策提高到“改造世界”和决定中国革命胜败的高度来教育我们，可见党的政策和它的正确贯彻执行，对实现党的政治路线，保证革命和建设事业的顺利发展，有着多么重要的意义。
    正是由于党的政策有如此巨大的作用和威力，因而广大干部和群众从自己的切身经验中得出了这样一条结论：“一定要按照党的政策办事”。我们党领导中国人民所取得的伟大胜利，就是党的政策的胜利。但是，在实际工作中，也还有少数干部，政策观念不强，不按照党的政策办事，或者不完全按照党的政策办事，以致给工作带来了某些不应有的损失。在这些同志中还有人提出许多“理由”，为自己的错误思想和行为辩解。
    “任务松的时候可以认真贯彻执行政策，任务紧急了，那里还有空儿仔细贯彻执行政策呢？”有的人持着这种错误观点，不去认真贯彻执行党的政策。这些同志并没有从思想上弄通任务和政策的辩证关系。他们形而上学地把任务和政策对立起来看待，似乎要很快完成任务，就不能细致贯彻政策；要细致贯彻政策，就不能很快完成任务。事实上，任务和政策是完全一致的，政策是为任务服务的，任务是靠政策完成的。所以，只有正确地贯彻执行了政策，才能很好的完成任务；政策贯彻的越好，任务完成的就越好。这是因为我们所做的任何一件工作，都是群众自己的事情，我们党的任何一项政策，都是群众利益的集中表现。正因如此，只要我们把政策和道理向群众讲清楚，让群众不仅知“其然”，而且更知其“所以然”，人们的积极性和创造性才可以充分地发挥出来，才会去自觉地完成任务。毛主席说：“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做。……群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。”在我们实际工作中也有很多同志亲身体会到：认真地、细致地贯彻执行党的政策，看起来麻烦，实际上省事；想起来慢，干起来快。由此可见，任务越艰巨，时间越紧迫，就越要严肃认真地贯彻执行党的政策。
    也有的人，借口“情况特殊”，而不能严肃贯彻执行党的政策。他们只强调“特殊”，而不强调统一，只讲灵活性，而不讲原则性。这些同志不懂得这二者之间的辩证关系，把对党负责和对群众负责对立起来看待。我们认为，党的政策的原则性和具体执行中的灵活性、对党负责和对人民负责，是完全一致的。刘少奇同志曾说过：“除了人民的利益之外，党再无自己的特殊利益。最广大人民的最大利益，即是真理的最高标准，即是我们党员一切行动的最高标准。每个党员对人民负责，即是对党负责，对人民不负责，即是对党最不负责。要理解对党负责与对人民负责的一致性，要使二者统一起来，不要使二者割裂开来，对立起来。”因此，在具体执行党的政策的过程中，只要是为了更好地贯彻执行党的政策原则，只要是为了“最广大人民的最大利益”，是允许从实际出发根据当地的具体情况和条件有所灵活的。这样作，对党对人民都是有百益而无一害的。但是，同时还必须认识，党的政策是统一全党意志和行动的准则，这就是说，任何借口“情况特殊”、“灵活运用”而不认真贯彻执行党的政策的行为，都是“破坏党的纪律与统一”和损害“中国人民的根本利益”的，因而，都是应该坚决反对和迅速克服的。
