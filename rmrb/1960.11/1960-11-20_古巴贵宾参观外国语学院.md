Xinhua News Agency, November 19th—Major Guevara, head of the National Bank of Cuba, and the distinguished guests of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation he leads, visited the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute this morning.

When the Cuban guests arrived at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, they were warmly welcomed by Dong Chuncai, Deputy Minister of Education and Vice President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, and Liu Ke and Li Dihua, Vice Presidents of the Institute. Hundreds of male and female students lined the entrance to welcome the distinguished guests, waving colorful flags and shouting slogans. Students from the Spanish Department shouted in Spanish: "Long live Chinese-Cuban friendship!" "Salute to the heroic Cuban people!" "Yes to Cuba, no to the Yankees!" Wherever the distinguished guests went, bursts of welcoming applause erupted.

The guests visited the institute's reference room, library, reading room, audio-visual education research room, and the institute's own printing factory and oil refinery. In the reading room, Major Guevara spoke cordially with the students in Spanish. A female student even read aloud to Major Guevara in Spanish the news published in the People's Daily about Premier Zhou Enlai's banquet in honor of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation. When the guests arrived at the oil refinery, they encountered a group of students in work clothes working. Major Guevara asked the students about their feelings about participating in labor, and the students replied: "We are students in the classroom, and workers on the construction site; we learn theory in the classroom, and practice on the construction site." Major Guevara nodded with satisfaction, looking very pleased.

Before leaving, Major Guevara left a message in front of the tape recorder in the audio-visual education research room, wishing the students continued efforts in their studies, and praising them for combining learning and labor.

The guests also visited the National Industrial and Transportation Exhibition today. The guests were accompanied throughout the morning by Li Qiang, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Shen Jian, Chinese Ambassador to Cuba, and Lin Ping, Deputy Director of the Department of American and Australian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

    新华社19日讯　古巴国家银行行长格瓦拉少校和他率领的古巴革命政府经济代表团的贵宾们，今天上午参观了北京外国语学院。
    古巴贵宾们到达北京外国语学院的时候，受到教育部副部长、中国拉丁美洲友好协会副会长董纯才，这个学院的副院长刘柯、李棣华的热情欢迎。在大门口夹道欢迎贵宾的数百名男女学生，手执彩旗，高呼口号。西班牙语系的学生们用西班牙语高呼：“中国古巴友好万岁！”“向英勇的古巴人民致敬！”“要古巴、不要美国佬！”贵宾们走到那里，那里便发出阵阵欢迎的掌声。
    贵宾在这个学院参观了资料室、图书馆、阅览室、电化教学研究室和学院自办的印刷厂、炼油厂。在阅览室里，格瓦拉少校用西班牙语和同学们亲切谈话。一位女同学还用西班牙语把人民日报刊登周恩来总理欢宴古巴革命政府经济代表团的消息，读给格瓦拉少校听。贵宾们来到炼油厂以后，正遇上一群穿着工作服的学生们劳动。格瓦拉少校问同学们参加劳动的感想，同学们回答说：“我们在课堂是学生，在工地就是工人；到课堂学理论，到工地就实践。”格瓦拉少校满意地点着头，显得很高兴。
    在临离开的时候，格瓦拉少校在电化教学研究室的录音机前留言，祝同学们继续努力学习，并且赞许同学们把学习和劳动结合起来。
