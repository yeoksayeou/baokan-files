The Paris newspaper "Les Echos," in an article on October 18, admitted that the French economy has been stagnant since the third quarter. The newspaper cited official statistics saying that the "non-seasonal changes" index of French industrial production was 177 in December of last year, 176 in July of this year, and 178 in August.

The newspaper also cited figures on the unemployed population released by the French Ministry of Finance: The number of workers seeking employment increased by 5% in September compared to August, and had increased to 100,800 by the beginning of October. The number of unemployed receiving relief was 27,200 on July 1, and had increased to 28,100 on August 1.

"Les Echos" concluded: "The majority of French industry is generally... progressing slowly"; moreover, there are also some "very unfavorable sectors, either suffering from institutional crises (coal, shipbuilding, leather), or experiencing difficult situations (automobiles, furniture, certain textile sectors)."

    法经济第三季度以来陷于停滞
    一些工业部门面临困难　失业人数不断增加
    本报讯　巴黎“回声报”在10月18日的一篇文章中承认，法国经济在第三季度以来，已陷于停滞状态。这家报纸引用官方的统计数字说，法国工业生产的“非季节性变化的”指数去年12月为一百七十七，而今年7月份为一百七十六，8月份为一百七十八。
    报纸还引用了法国财政部公布的有关失业人口的数字：寻求工作的工人人数，今年9月份比8月份增加了5％，10月初已增为十万零八千人。受救济的失业人数，7月1日为二万七千二百人，8月1日已增为二万八千一百人。
    “回声报”最后认为：“法国工业的大部分，大体上都是……进展缓慢”；而且，还有着一些“很不顺利的部门，或者是遭到机构上的危机（煤炭、造船、皮革），或者是经历着困难情况（汽车、家具、某些纺织部门）”。
