Let the Masses Grasp Policies, Use Policies to Promote Production
The Gangdi Brigade Party Branch of the Neibu Commune in Ruyang County Emphasizes the Implementation of Party Policies

(Reported by this newspaper) The Gangdi Brigade Party Branch of Neibu Commune in Ruyang County, Henan Province, in leading production, conscientiously implements the Party's various guidelines and policies in rural areas, hands over the policies to the masses, and fully mobilizes the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses, thereby promoting the continuous leap forward of various production and work tasks.

The Gangdi Brigade Party Branch has deeply realized in its various work and practices that constantly studying and delving into the Party's guidelines and policies, enhancing policy awareness, and improving policy understanding are important prerequisites for implementing the Party's guidelines and policies. Therefore, the branch has determined that studying Party policies is an important part of the political course in the Red and Expert School. Whenever the Party's policies are issued, it immediately organizes cadres to study and discuss them, so that everyone recognizes the important significance of the Party's policies, and then publicizes and implements them to the masses. In the past, according to old habits, most of the land in this brigade was only planted for one season, and one-third of it had to be left as sun-dried land every year. Although the cultivated area has been expanded somewhat in recent years, the increase in total output has been limited. In order to change this situation, last spring the brigade party branch organized cadres to study the Party's guideline of combining multiple planting and harvesting with high yield and more harvesting, and launched discussions, so that everyone realized that it was not that old habits could not be changed, but that the study and implementation of the Party's policies were insufficient. Through this study, ideological understanding was unified, and everyone agreed that multiple planting and harvesting must be combined with high yield and more harvesting in order to continuously increase agricultural output. The Party branch then organized forces to carry out publicity and education work among the broad masses, so that the Party's policies became the actual actions of the broad masses. As a result, not only was the area of sun-dried land reduced, but also more than 400 mu of cultivated land was expanded by utilizing barren slopes, roadsides, field edges, and other areas, and all of them were planted with grain crops and vegetables. This autumn, more than 34,000 jin of grain and 230,000 jin of vegetables were harvested. The commune members happily said, "With the Party's policies, everything is easy to handle. The Party is thinking of us everywhere, and even idle land has become a nest of grain and vegetables."

When implementing various policies, the Gangdi Brigade Party Branch pays great attention to improving the masses' awareness of implementing policies. For example, this spring, when preparing topdressing fertilizer for wheat and implementing the policy of combining collective fertilizer accumulation with commune members' household fertilizer accumulation, the leader of the Shangzhuang production team was afraid of trouble and feared that commune members' household fertilizer accumulation would affect collective production. After learning about this situation, the brigade party branch immediately sent cadres to the Shangzhuang production team to publicize the Party's policies, explaining in detail that commune members can engage in household fertilizer accumulation on the principle of completing the quota tasks of the work group and not affecting collective production, and the team should conscientiously implement the policy of pricing according to quality and paying in cash. As a result of this implementation, while collective production was well done, the commune members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer was even higher, and the fertilizer task was completed more and better. Team leader Zhang Caiwa said when summarizing his work: "Resolutely and meticulously implementing the Party's guidelines and policies seems troublesome, but it is actually time-saving; when the policies are mastered by the masses, the work is twice the result with half the effort."

In the implementation of policies, the Gangdi Brigade Party Branch is also good at using the method of summarizing advanced experiences to educate cadres with examples, improve their awareness of implementing policies, solve problems in the implementation of policies, and ensure that the Party's guidelines and policies truly meet the masses and are implemented to the end. Party branch secretary Kang Dongyin went deep into the Shanggangdi production team, which conscientiously implements the policy of distribution according to labor and more pay for more work, and held discussions with the masses to summarize their experiences. This team can adhere to the implementation of contracting quotas and work-point recording for both large and small tasks. The main reason is that the cadres take the lead in implementing the policies resolutely, are able to cash them in time, and constantly conduct inspections to discover problems and solve them in time.

    让群众掌握政策　用政策推动生产
    汝阳县内埠公社岗底大队党支部重视贯彻党的政策
    本报讯　河南省汝阳县内埠公社岗底大队党支部在领导生产中，认真贯彻执行党在农村中的各项方针政策，把政策交给群众，充分调动广大群众的劳动积极性，因而推动了各项生产和工作不断跃进。
    岗底大队党支部在各项工作、实践中深刻地体会到：经常学习钻研党的方针政策，增强政策观念，提高政策水平，是贯彻执行党的方针政策的重要前提。因此，支部确定，学习党的政策是红专学校政治课程的重要内容；每逢党的政策下达后，就立即组织干部学习、讨论，使大家认识到党的政策的重要意义，然后向群众宣传贯彻。这个大队过去根据老习惯，大部土地只种一季，每年要留三分之一的晒旱地。几年来虽然扩大了一些耕地面积，但总产量提高的还有限。为了改变这种局面，去年春季大队党支部组织干部学习了党的关于多种多收与高产多收相结合的方针，并展开了讨论，从而使大家认识到，不是老习惯不能改变，而是学习贯彻党的政策不够。通过这一学习，统一了思想认识，大家一致认为，多种多收必须与高产多收相结合，才能不断提高农业产量。党支部随即组织力量向广大群众开展了宣传教育工作，使党的政策变成了广大群众的实际行动，结果不但缩小了晒旱地的面积，而且利用荒坡、路边、场边、地边等扩大耕地面积四百多亩，全部种上了粮食作物和蔬菜，今年秋季多收粮食三万四千多斤，蔬菜二十三万斤。社员们高兴地说：“有了党的政策啥事都好办，党处处为咱打算，空闲地也变成了粮菜窝。”
    岗底大队党支部在贯彻各项政策时，十分注意提高群众贯彻执行政策的自觉性。例如，今年春季为小麦备追肥，贯彻执行集体积肥与社员家庭积肥相结合的政策时，上庄生产队队长怕麻烦，怕社员搞家庭积肥会影响集体生产，大队党支部了解到这个情况以后，就立即派干部到上庄生产队宣传党的政策，详细说明了社员在完成作业组的定额任务和不影响集体生产的原则下，可以搞家庭积肥，队里要认真执行以质论价、现款收购的政策。这样执行的结果，在搞好集体生产的同时，社员们积肥的积极性更高，肥料任务完成得又多又好。队长张才娃在总结工作时说：“坚决细致地贯彻执行党的方针政策，看来是麻烦，实际是省事；政策为群众掌握，做工作事半功倍。”
    在贯彻执行政策中，岗底大队党支部还善于运用总结先进经验的方法，以实例教育干部，提高执行政策的自觉性，解决执行政策中的问题，使党的方针政策切实和群众见面，贯彻到底。党支部书记康东寅深入到认真执行按劳分配多劳多得政策的上岗底生产队，和群众进行座谈，总结他们的经验。这个队无论大活小活都能坚持实行包工定额和评工记分，主要是干部带头执行政策坚决，能够及时兑现，不断进行检查，发现问题，及时解决。
