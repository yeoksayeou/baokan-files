Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th – Sichuan is adopting various measures to overcome continuous rain and low temperatures, meticulously harvesting double-season late rice. As of October 25th, the province has harvested over 800,000 mu of double-season late rice, basically achieving careful harvesting and threshing.

Sichuan Province often experiences low temperatures and rain during the late rice harvesting season. To ensure timely harvesting and reduce grain loss and spoilage, all regions made full preparations before the late rice harvest, formulating harvesting plans at all levels. Yibin and Jiangjin prefectures, the main double-season late rice producing areas, universally promoted the traditional experience of harvesting "90% yellow" rice after formulating harvesting plans, harvesting each section as it turns yellow, ensuring both harvesting progress and avoiding grain loss due to over-ripening. Various regions, in response to the characteristics of low temperatures and rainy weather, added various drying facilities to prevent spoilage and loss of rice. Junlian County rushed to repair over 200 kilns before the harvest and stored large amounts of firewood to prepare for threshing in rainy weather. Fuji District in Luxian County rushed to build 156 drying rooms; the Desheng Commune in this district can dry 7,500 jin of grain at a time in each drying room. During the three days of rain from October 6th to 8th, over 50 threshing teams in the Chengdong Management Area of the Shizi Commune in Bishan County continued to work as usual, using kilns and residual heat from the iron factory's blast furnaces to dry wet grain, drying 160,000 jin of grain in three days, ensuring timely storage and preventing spoilage and germination.

Various regions also fully utilized the successful experiences of meticulous harvesting of early and mid-season rice, plugging loopholes in every stage of harvesting, threshing, drying, and storing, to reduce scattering and waste.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 30th – Double-season late rice is generally ripening in Jiangxi, and various regions have concentrated large numbers of cadres and laborers to rush the harvest, striving for more and better harvests. Currently, the province has rushed to harvest over 3 million mu of double-season late rice.

Jiangxi's double-season late rice has increased significantly this year, and with the addition of one-season late rice, soybeans, sweet potatoes, and other grain crops harvested in the autumn, the total autumn harvest area has increased significantly compared to last year. To resolutely achieve a good autumn harvest and realize the annual grain production plan, various regions have transferred troops and generals, concentrating cadres and labor on the front lines of the autumn harvest. The province has transferred over 80,000 cadres and nearly 700,000 laborers from all levels of government and various industries to participate in the autumn harvest. At the same time, party secretaries at all levels and cadres participating in the autumn harvest are assigned to be responsible for specific areas, dividing and contracting areas, so that the autumn harvest work can be carried out quickly and well.

This year, due to the expansion of the double-season late rice area, some late rice seedlings were transplanted later, and they were also attacked by natural disasters such as drought and insects, so the ripening period is inconsistent. To ensure careful harvesting and threshing, each commune in Ji'an County determined the order of harvesting according to the variety and ripening sequence, harvesting the early ripening, easily shattering, and lodged rice first, universally ensuring timely harvesting. Suichuan County summarized the experience of harvesting nine out of ten ripenings in previous years, harvesting each piece as it ripens, and each field as it ripens, completely eliminating the phenomenon of harvesting green or overripe rice.

In the autumn harvest, various regions pay attention to careful harvesting and threshing, improving the quality of the harvest from every stage of cutting, threshing, transporting, drying, and storing, striving to bring every grain into the granary. A large number of models who cherish grain and meticulously harvest have emerged in many regions. The Luohu Commune in Linchuan County launched a mass movement for everyone to strive to be a model of cherishing grain, and 172 harvesting experts emerged in the commune. Cadres participating in the autumn harvest in various regions also often summarize advanced experiences in meticulous harvesting and threshing with commune members during the labor process, continuously improving the quality of the harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 30th – Double-season late rice in Hunan Province has ripened, and currently, the broad masses of commune members are enthusiastically throwing themselves into the harvest work. As of the 24th, the province had harvested over 200,000 mu, basically achieving careful threshing and harvesting, and timely harvesting.

This year, under the leadership of the Party, the commune members of the broad rural people's communes in Hunan Province have brought into play the enormous power of the people's communes, overcoming the long-term summer and autumn drought, so that the planting area of double-season late rice has increased significantly compared to last year. To ensure timely harvesting, before the harvest, people's communes in various regions, with production teams or work groups as units, inspected the fields, ranked the rice seedlings, identified different varieties and ripening sequences, and assessed them field by field, making harvesting plans, so that each field was harvested as it turned yellow. In rushing the harvest of double-season late rice, Yongxing County adopted the method of dividing people into groups, assigning fields to groups, and setting quotas for fields, organizing more than 58,000 laborers in the county into three fronts for harvesting, transporting, and drying, establishing more than 3,700 combat teams, and implementing a responsibility system of fixed leadership, fixed labor, fixed quality, fixed work points, and fixed time, with inspections and acceptance at all levels, ensuring the quality of the harvest. The more than 30,000 mu of double-season late rice that has already been harvested has basically met the requirements of no grain loss during cutting and no grain loss during threshing. Many places vigorously promote new tools and advanced operating methods to ensure the timely harvest of late rice.

Our newspaper, Wuhan, 30th – Double-season late rice in Hubei has gradually ripened, and various regions are concentrating their efforts to rush the harvest and threshing.

This year, Hubei Province's double-season late rice was attacked by natural disasters such as drought, flood, wind, and insects during the sowing and growing period. To overcome natural disasters and strive for more harvests, the double-season rice producing areas throughout the province launched a "plant one field, protect one field" anti-drought upsurge. Through the heroic and tenacious struggle of the broad masses in various regions, the extent of the disaster was greatly reduced. Before the double-season late rice harvest, various regions had mostly made early preparations, emphasizing careful harvesting and threshing, striving to recover all the grain in hand.

To seize the season, without losing or scattering grain, ensuring that every grain enters the granary, cadres at all levels in various regions went deep among the masses and into the fields to participate in harvesting and threshing activities. Huanggang Prefecture alone transferred more than 12,000 cadres to various commune production teams and production squads. Wang Youbao, Deputy Secretary of the October Commune Party Committee in Xishui County, went deep into the production team to discuss with the masses, analyzed the growth characteristics of double-season late rice this year, and adopted various concrete measures. The double-season late rice already harvested by this team achieved clean fields, clean roads, and clean threshing.

    四川江西湖南湖北广大干部和社员投入秋收第一线
    晚稻九成黄  适时收割忙
    推广割、打、运、晒、藏各个环节先进经验出现许多精收细打标兵
    新华社成都30日电　四川各地采取各种措施战胜霪雨低温，精细收割双季晚稻。截至10月25日止，全省已收割双季晚稻八十多万亩，基本上做到了精收细打。
    四川省每到晚稻收割季节经常低温多雨。为了确保及时收割，减少丢粒霉烂，各地早在晚稻收割以前即进行了充分准备，层层制订收割规划。双季晚稻主要产区宜宾、江津专区各县，在制订了收割规划以后，普遍推行收“九成黄”的传统经验，黄一块收一块，既保证收割进度，又避免因过于黄熟而发生丢粒现象。各地针对低温多雨的气候特点，增添各种烘烤设备，防止稻谷霉烂损失。筠连县在收割之前就赶修了二百多处炕灶，并储存大批柴草，为雨天打谷作必要准备。泸县福集区各公社赶修了烘干室一百五十六处，这个区的得胜公社，每个烘干室一次可以烘烤谷子七千五百斤。璧山县狮子公社城东管理区在10月6日至8日的三天阴雨期间，五十多个打谷组照常工作，他们利用炕灶和铁厂高炉余热烘烤湿谷，三天之中烘干了十六万斤谷子，做到及时入仓，没有发生霉烂生芽现象。
    各地还充分运用精细收割早、中稻的成功经验，从收、打、晒、藏等各个环节上堵塞漏洞，减少抛撒浪费。
    新华社南昌30日电　江西各地双季晚稻普遍黄熟，各地集中了大批干部和劳力抢收，力争多收，收好。目前全省已经抢收双季晚稻三百多万亩。
    江西今年双季晚稻比去年增加了很多，加上在秋季收获的一季晚稻、大豆、红薯等粮食作物，秋收总面积比去年增加很多。为了坚决把秋收收好，实现全年粮食生产计划，各地纷纷调兵遣将，把干部和劳动力集中到秋收第一线。全省从各级机关和各行各业抽调八万余名干部、近七十万劳力投入秋收。同时，各级党委书记和参加秋收的干部，定人负责，划片包干，使秋收工作开展得又快又好。
    今年由于双季晚稻面积扩大，有些晚稻插秧较迟，又遇到旱、虫等自然灾害的侵袭，因此成熟期不一致。为了保证细收细打，吉安县各公社依品种和成熟先后，确定收割次序，成熟早的、容易脱粒的、倒伏的先割，普遍做到了适时收割。遂川县总结往年九熟十收的经验，熟一片，割一片，熟一丘，割一丘，全部杜绝了割青禾、割过熟禾的现象。
    各地在秋收中，注意精收细打，从割、打、运、晒、藏各个环节提高收获质量，力争颗粒归仓。许多地区涌现出大批爱惜粮食、精收细打的标兵，临川县罗湖公社开展人人争当爱粮模范的群众运动，全社涌现了一百七十二名收获能手。各地参加秋收的干部在劳动过程中也经常和社员一起总结精收细打先进经验，不断提高收获质量。
    新华社长沙30日电　湖南省的双季晚稻已成熟，目前广大社员群众热情洋溢地投入了收获工作。截至24日止，全省已经收割二十多万亩，基本上做到了细打细收，适时收割。
    今年湖南省的广大农村人民公社的社员们在党的领导下，发挥了人民公社的巨大威力，战胜了长期的夏秋干旱，使双季晚稻的播种面积比去年增加了许多。为了保证适时收割，在收割前各地人民公社以生产队或作业组为单位，临田察看，进行禾苗排队，分别不同品种，成熟先后，逐丘鉴定，做好收割规划，因而做到黄熟一丘，收割一丘。永兴县在抢收双季晚稻中，采取按人分组，以组定田，以田定额的办法，将全县五万八千多劳动力组成收、运、晒三条战线，成立了三千七百多个战斗小组，实行了定领导、定劳力、定质量、定工分、定时间的责任制，层层组织检查验收，保证了收获的质量。目前已经收获的三万多亩双季晚稻，基本上达到了割不丢穗、扮不丢粒的要求。很多地方都大力推广新式工具和先进操作方法，保证了晚稻及时收割。
    本报武汉30日电　湖北双季晚稻已经陆续黄熟，各地正集中力量突击抢收抢打。
    今年湖北省双季晚稻播种和生长期间先后遭到了旱、涝、风、虫等自然灾害的袭击。为了战胜自然灾害，力争多收，全省双季稻产地掀起了“种一丘、保一丘”的抗旱热潮。经过各地广大群众英勇顽强的斗争，大大减轻了灾害程度。各地在双季晚稻收割以前，大都及早作好准备工作，强调精收细打，力争把到手的粮食全部收回来。
    为了抢住季节，不丢不撒，颗粒归仓，各地各级干部都深入群众，深入田间，参加收、打活动。仅黄冈专区抽调到各公社生产队和生产小队的干部就达一万二千多人。浠水县十月公社党委副书记王佑保，深入到生产队与群众座谈，分析了今年双季晚稻生长的特点，采取了各项具体措施，这个队已收的双季晚稻做到了田净、路净、脱粒净。
