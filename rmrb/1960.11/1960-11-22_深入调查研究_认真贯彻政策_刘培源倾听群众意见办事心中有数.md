    Thorough Investigation and Research, Conscientious Implementation of Policies
    Liu Peiyuan Listens to the Opinions of the Masses and Makes Decisions with Confidence
    (Our newspaper's Nanchang dispatch, 21st) Reporter Yi Jun and Guanghui report: Liu Peiyuan, the First Secretary of the Binjiang Commune Party Committee in Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, conducted in-depth investigations and visits among the masses during the winter planting season, patiently listening to their opinions, implementing the Party's policies, and fully mobilizing the production enthusiasm of all commune members. This led to better implementation of the principle of "more production from diverse crops and high yields from good crops," resulting in greater quantity and quality in winter planting.
    At the end of September, Binjiang Commune planned to expand the winter planting area from 37,500 mu last year to 42,500 mu. However, only a little over 32,000 mu were implemented within a week. What caused the plan not to be fully realized? To find the key to the problem, Liu Peiyuan, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, decided to conduct in-depth investigation and research.
    One day in early October, Liu Peiyuan went deep into the Zhoushang team of Binjiang Brigade. He hoed weeds in the late sweet potato field with the commune members, talking about the situation: "How much land area is planted for winter crops?" Team leader Chen Maofu replied, "The plan is 250 mu, the actual cultivated area is more than 260 mu, there is no problem with the winter planting area. Look, there is a large piece of wasteland over there that can be reclaimed!" Liu Peiyuan looked in the direction Chen Maofu pointed and saw a large piece of island land covered with weeds, which could be completely reclaimed for winter crops. After learning about this situation, Liu Peiyuan went to the brigade headquarters to understand the overall situation of the brigade from the Party branch secretary and the captain. He found that the brigade was fully capable of ensuring the planned land area for winter planting. Liu Peiyuan was inspired by this and made a rough calculation of the land in the entire commune: the commune currently has a cultivated area of 41,000 mu. After excluding more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields that cannot be planted in winter, there are at least 39,000 mu that can be used for winter planting; the commune has more than 4,000 mu of wasteland. If 3,000 mu are reclaimed this winter for winter crops, the commune's winter planting plan can be guaranteed. This calculation refuted the claim that the winter planting plan could not be implemented because there was no land area.
    Were the masses unwilling to plant more? Liu Peiyuan then went to Wangjia and Zhangjia production teams to visit cadres, old farmers, young people, and women, who all said, "Planting more grain crops in winter can increase grain production in the coming spring; planting more green manure can better guarantee early rice production next year." Therefore, Liu Peiyuan believed that the reason why the winter planting plan could not be fully implemented was not because the commune members were unwilling to plant more.
    What exactly was the reason? Liu Peiyuan was determined to get to the bottom of it. He further investigated and visited Wangjia team carefully, and learned that the situation was as follows: the team now has 230 mu of cultivated land, but the area contracted to the team by the brigade under the "three guarantees" system was 240 mu, which included the land reclaimed and expanded, and was too full. Liu Peiyuan asked: "If the brigade contracts 230 mu of winter planting area to you, and the rest of the land reclaimed and expanded belongs to the team, what do you think?" Team leader Xie Lianyou said: "That would be great." After a pause, Xie Lianyou added, "To plant more, we not only need to increase manpower, but also need more people to manage it in the future." After hearing this situation, Liu Peiyuan discovered that if the winter planting plan was to be fully implemented, it was necessary to resolutely implement the "three guarantees and one reward" policy, adhere to the small part ownership of the production team, and ensure that there were sufficient laborers on the front line of agricultural production. Then Liu Peiyuan went to Panjia team to investigate and visit. After two days of visits, investigations, and analysis, Liu Peiyuan had a clear understanding of the reasons why the winter planting plan could not be fully implemented. He put forward three suggestions for implementing the policy of more production from diverse crops, implementing the expansion plan: 1. Correctly implement the "three guarantees and one reward" policy, and adhere to the policy of small part ownership of the production team. The area planned under the "three guarantees" should not be too full. For the crops planted by the team using the edges of fields and other idle land, the vast majority should belong to the team, and should generally not be included in the "three guarantees" scope, in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the production team for more production from diverse crops. 2. Implement the policy that people's communes retain private plots for commune members according to regulations, and that income from private plots belongs to individuals, to encourage commune members to plant more. 3. Implement policies related to labor force, ensure that the main labor force is concentrated on agricultural production, and that communes and brigades do not randomly transfer labor.
    After repeatedly visiting the masses, conducting investigation and research, and getting a real understanding from the front line of production, Liu Peiyuan returned to the commune with confidence and convened a Party committee meeting. After research and discussion, the Party committee fully agreed with his opinions and decided to act quickly, with all cadres going to the teams to convey and implement them. At this time, Liu Peiyuan went to Binjiang Brigade for the second time, organized brigade cadres to summarize the experience of going deep into the masses to implement policies, and immediately convened a on-site meeting in the brigade, introducing and promoting it to other brigades, greatly helping all commune cadres to go deep into the masses to implement the Party's policies.
    After the Party's policies were grasped by the masses, they immediately turned into conscious actions of the masses. More than 20,000 people in the commune are mobilized every day to expand the planting of winter crops. Up to now, 45,000 mu of various winter crops have been sown, exceeding the original plan by 2,500 mu, and the sowing season has been advanced by ten days, with an average of 15 dan more base fertilizer applied per mu, and one more plowing and harrowing.

    深入调查研究　认真贯彻政策
    刘培源倾听群众意见办事心中有数
    本报南昌21日电　记者易军、光辉报道：江西宜春县彬江公社党委第一书记刘培源，在冬种中深入群众调查访问，耐心倾听群众意见，贯彻党的政策，充分调动了全体社员的生产积极性，更好地贯彻了多种多收与高产多收方针，使冬种工作又多又好。
    9月底，彬江公社计划冬种面积要由去年三万七千五百亩扩大到四万二千五百亩。但一周内只落实了三万二千多亩。是什么原因使计划不能全部落实呢？为了找出问题关键，公社党委第一书记刘培源，决定深入调查研究。
    十月初旬的一天，刘培源深入彬江大队洲上小队，和社员们在晚番薯地里一面锄草，一面谈情况：“冬种有多少土地面积？”小队长陈茂福回答说：“计划二百五十亩，实有耕地面积二百六十多亩，冬种面积没有问题。喏，你看那边还有一大块荒地可开哩！”刘培源顺着陈茂福手指看去，只见不远的地方有一大片长有杂草的洲地，完全可以开垦种冬作物。刘培源了解到这些情况后，即到大队部找党支部书记和队长了解全大队情况，发现这个大队完成冬种计划的土地面积完全有保证。刘培源从中得到了启发，又把全社田地算了笔大账：全社现有耕地面积四万一千亩，除去一千多亩冬水田不能冬种以外，起码还有三万九千亩可以冬种；全社共有四千多亩荒地，今冬只要开垦三千亩种上冬作物，全社冬种计划就保证可以完成。这笔账否定了认为冬种计划落实不下去是因为没有土地面积的说法。
    是群众不愿意多种吗？刘培源接着又深入到王家和张家两个生产小队访问干部、老农、青年、妇女，他们都说：“冬季多种了粮食作物，明春可以增收一季粮食；多种了绿肥，明年早稻增产更有保证。”由此，刘培源认为冬种计划不能全部落实下去也不是因为社员不愿意多种。
    究竟是什么原因？刘培源决心打破沙锅问到底。他进一步深入王家小队仔细察看访问，知道了是这么回事：这个小队现在有耕地二百三十亩，而大队落实给小队的“三包”面积是二百四十亩，把开荒扩种的也打了进去，打得太满了。刘培源问：“如果大队包给你们二百三十亩冬种面积，其余开荒扩种的归小队所有，你们看怎么样？”小队长谢连友说：“那就美了。”停了一下，谢连友又说：“要多种，不仅要增加人力，今后还要多人管理。”刘培源听了这些情况，从中发现冬种计划如果要全部落实下去，就必须坚决贯彻“三包一奖”政策，坚持生产小队的小部分所有制，并保证农业生产第一线有足够的劳动力。接着刘培源又深入到潘家小队去调查访问。经过两天访问调查和分析，刘培源对冬种计划不能全部落实的原因有了底。对在冬种中贯彻多种多收的方针，落实扩种计划，提出了三条意见：一、正确贯彻好“三包一奖”，坚持生产小队小部分所有制的政策。“三包”计划面积不能打得满满的，对于小队利用田边地角和其他闲散土地扩种的作物，绝大部分归小队所有，一般不计入“三包”范围，以调动生产小队多种多收的积极性。二、贯彻好人民公社按规定比例给社员留自留地和自留地收入归个人的政策，鼓励社员多种。三、贯彻好有关劳力问题的政策，保证集中主要劳动力在农业生产上，公社和大队不乱调劳动力。
    刘培源经过反复访问群众，调查研究，从生产第一线上摸到了真正的底之后，便胸有成竹地回到公社召开党委会。党委会经过研究讨论，完全赞同他的意见，决定迅速行动起来，全体干部分头下队传达贯彻。这时，刘培源又二下彬江大队，组织大队干部总结了深入群众贯彻政策的经验，立即在这里召开了全社现场会，向各大队介绍推广，大大帮助了全社干部深入群众贯彻党的政策。
    党的政策被群众掌握后，立即变为了群众的自觉行动。全社每天出动二万多人扩种冬作物。到目前为止，播种各样冬作物四万五千亩，比原定计划超过二千五百亩，而且播种季节提早了十天，平均每亩多施了十五担基肥，多做了一次犁耙。（附图片）
