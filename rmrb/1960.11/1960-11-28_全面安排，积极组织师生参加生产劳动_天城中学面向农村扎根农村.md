    Comprehensive Arrangements, Actively Organize Teachers and Students to Participate in Productive Labor
    Tiancheng Middle School Faces the Countryside and Takes Root in the Countryside
    (Our Report) Anhui's Tongcheng County's Tiancheng Junior Middle School, under the leadership of the Party, has clearly established a direction of facing the countryside and serving agricultural production, resolutely implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, comprehensively arranging teaching, productive labor and scientific research. While actively organizing students to do a good job in on-campus production, it has adopted the method of school-commune linkage, vigorously supporting agricultural production in terms of manpower, materials, technology and culture, which has both promoted the development of agricultural production and improved the quality of teaching, achieving an all-round harvest of ideology, teaching, labor, and scientific research.
    Tiancheng Junior Middle School is a rural middle school founded in 1956. From the very beginning, it has paid attention to facing the countryside and taking root in the countryside, actively organizing students to participate in agricultural labor and support the production of nearby communes and teams. Tiancheng Junior Middle School's methods of supporting agricultural production are roughly as follows: one is that, usually, classes are used as units to directly link up with production teams and provide comprehensive support in terms of manpower, materials, technology, and culture. The other is that the school and the linked production team jointly cultivate experimental fields, and then promote the successful experience of the experimental fields to help the production team increase the yield per unit area. The school's support for agricultural production has gradually developed from temporary, seasonal, and unfixed support to the current comprehensive, long-term, fixed, and regular and crash support. The school also adopted the method of "sending labor to the team, sending fertilizer to the fields, sending technology to the door, sending improved seeds to the team, and sending culture to the people" in its support for agricultural production, actively helping brigades with poorer conditions to change their backward appearance. Over the past four years, the school has achieved great success in supporting agricultural production.
    In the process of actively organizing students to participate in productive labor, the school has always made comprehensive arrangements for teaching, productive labor, and scientific research according to the principle of "one main, two auxiliary, and three combinations" for full-time schools. Every Saturday afternoon, classes take turns going to the linked production teams to collectively participate in labor. The school also pays attention to supplementing appropriate materials to the content of some courses according to the needs of production, so that theory and practice, book knowledge and production are closely combined, and the continuous improvement of teaching quality is promoted.
    In order to better serve agricultural production and further improve teaching quality, Tiancheng Junior Middle School has vigorously carried out scientific research activities with agriculture as the main content, combined with teaching and productive labor. The scientific research topics proposed by the school are all problems that urgently need to be solved in agricultural production. In conducting research, different arrangements are made according to the knowledge level and curriculum settings of students in each grade. In the past few years, the school's teachers and students have combined teaching and productive labor to carry out more than 120 scientific researches on the growth of grain, oil, cotton and other crops, the preparation of indigenous fertilizers and pesticides, as well as the grafting of fruit trees and the breeding of poultry and livestock, and have introduced more than 150 excellent varieties from other places. After testing, 45 items are suitable for promotion in the local area. In addition, according to scientific principles, combined with the local production practice, through experiments, more than ten materials such as the "Draft of Early Rice Field Management Regulations", "How to Prevent Pig Diseases", "Zheda Long Radish Cultivation Method", and "Spring Silkworm Breeding" have been compiled and promoted to nearby communes, further promoting the development of agricultural production. Recently, under the ideological guidance of agriculture as the foundation, according to the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain, the school has focused on the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production, combined with local production, and vigorously engaged in scientific research.
    Tiancheng Junior Middle School actively organizes teachers and students to participate in rural production and construction and political movements. The vast number of teachers and students have received profound class education and labor training from it, and have generally improved their political awareness and established the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and serving agricultural production. Now, all teachers and students in the school have developed good labor habits, and they regard labor as a pleasant job.

    全面安排，积极组织师生参加生产劳动
    天城中学面向农村扎根农村
    本报讯　安徽桐城县天城初中，在党的领导下，明确树立面向农村，为农业生产服务的方向，坚决贯彻执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，全面安排教学、生产劳动和科学研究，在积极组织学生搞好校内生产的同时，采取校社挂钩的办法，从人力、物力、技术和文化等方面，大力支援农业生产，既推动了农业生产的发展，又提高了教学质量，实现了思想、教学、劳动、科学研究全面丰收。
    天城初中是1956年创办的一所农村中学，从一开始就注意面向农村，扎根农村，积极组织学生参加农业劳动，支援附近社、队的生产。天城初中支援农业生产的方式大致有：一种是，平时以班为单位，直接与生产队挂钩，从人力、物力、技术、文化等方面进行全面支援。还有一种是，学校与挂钩的生产队合种试验田，然后推广试验田的成功经验，帮助生产队提高单位面积的产量。这所学校支援农业生产，已逐步由临时性的、季节性的、不固定的支援，发展到目前全面的、长期的、固定的、经常性和突击性相结合的支援。该校在支援农业生产中还采取“送劳力到队、送肥料下田、送技术上门、送良种到队、送文化到人”的办法，积极帮助条件较差的大队，改变落后面貌。四年来，该校在支援农业生产上取得了巨大成绩。
    这所学校在积极组织学生参加生产劳动的过程中，一直根据全日制学校“一主、二辅、三结合”的原则，对教学、生产劳动、科学研究作了全面安排。每逢星期六下午，以班为单位，轮流去挂钩的生产队，集体参加劳动。学校还注意将部分课程的内容，根据生产需要，补充适当材料，使理论与实际、书本知识与生产密切结合，促进教学质量的不断提高。
    为了更好地为农业生产服务，进一步提高教学质量，天城初中结合教学和生产劳动，大力开展以农业为主要内容的科学研究活动。学校提出的科学研究题目，全部是农业生产上急需解决的问题。在进行研究时，又根据各年级学生的知识水平和课程设置，进行了不同的安排。几年来，该校师生结合教学和生产劳动，对粮、油、棉等作物的生长，土化肥、土农药的配制以及果树嫁接和家禽家畜的饲养等进行了一百二十多项科学研究，并从外地引进了一百五十多项优良品种，经过试验有四十五项适合在当地推广。此外，还根据科学原理，结合当地生产实际，通过试验，编写了“早稻田间管理规程草案”、“怎样防止猪的疾病”、“浙大长萝卜栽培方法”、“春蚕的饲养”等十多篇材料，向附近各公社作了推广介绍，进一步推动农业生产的发展。最近，该校在以农业为基础的思想指导下，根据大办农业、大办粮食的方针，围绕农业生产“八字宪法”，结合当地生产，大搞科学研究。
    天城初中积极组织师生参加农村生产建设和政治运动，广大师生从中受到了深刻的阶级教育和劳动锻炼，普遍提高了政治觉悟，树立了以农业为基础、为农业生产服务的思想。现在，全校师生都养成了良好的劳动习惯，他们把劳动看作是愉快的工作。
