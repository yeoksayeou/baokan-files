    Ignoring National Security, Believing in Deterrence, Intensifying Collusion with the United States
    British Government Agrees to the Establishment of American Missile Submarine Base in Britain

Xinhua News Agency, London, November 1st. British Prime Minister Macmillan announced in the House of Commons on the 1st that the British government will establish a base in the Clyde River estuary in Scotland for American submarines carrying "Polaris" missiles.

This news was announced at a time when the British public is increasingly opposed to American nuclear weapon bases that threaten British security and independence. The "Daily Herald" said that the British public's reaction to this news was "both angry and uneasy." Across the Atlantic, the White House welcomed this and Eisenhower said that this was "further evidence of Anglo-American cooperation for the benefit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance."

According to this decision, a warehouse ship storing American missiles will be established in February next year, and a floating dock will also be set up subsequently. The British Admiralty issued a statement on the same evening, saying that the Anglo-American agreement on the establishment of the "Polaris" missile base has no fixed time limit. This base will be stationed with 1,500 American personnel, not counting the personnel on the submarines. It is expected that the first such American submarine will arrive at the base in early March next year.

In his speech, Macmillan tried to defend the policy of Britain binding itself to the American chariot. He said: "I have a responsibility to warn the House that until we achieve international disarmament, it would be foolish to relax Western defenses—and nuclear deterrence is an important part of such defenses." Macmillan admitted that the establishment of an American "Polaris" missile base "may seem likely to increase uneasy feelings." However, he hoped that Parliament would agree to do so because "we have no other way." Refusing this agreement would be inconsistent with the spirit of the Western alliance. He said, "We will continue to rely on our close cooperation and understanding with the United States in all these defense matters."

Macmillan disguised himself by saying, "Wherever these (American) submarines may be, I am fully convinced that no decision will be made to use these missiles without prior consultation that may be the most comprehensive." However, the American authorities "were surprised" by Macmillan's remarks. U.S. State Department officials said that when it came to establishing this base, no such promise was made.

Three Scottish Labour Party members interrupted Macmillan's speech. One of the members pointed out that Scotland would feel great indignation because the people did not want to be threatened with destruction. Another member questioned Macmillan whether he would hold a referendum in Scotland on this matter. Macmillan replied "no," and he also said, "I am not even willing to hold a referendum within the opposition party."

### 不顾国家安全　迷信威慑力量　加紧勾结美国  英政府同意美国在英设立导弹潜艇基地

    帝国主义国家相互勾结加紧备战
    不顾国家安全　迷信威慑力量　加紧勾结美国
    英政府同意美国在英设立导弹潜艇基地
    据新华社伦敦1日电　英国首相麦克米伦1日在下院宣布，英国政府将在苏格兰克莱德河河口区建立一个供携带“北极星”导弹的美国潜水艇使用的基地。
    这个消息是在英国公众日益反对威胁英国安全和独立的美国核武器基地的时候宣布的。“每日先驱报”说，英国公众对这个消息的反应是“又愤怒又不安”。而在大西洋彼岸的白宫则对此表示欢迎，艾森豪威尔说，这是“英美为北大西洋公约组织联盟的利益进行合作的又一个证据”。
    根据这一决定，储存美国导弹的一艘仓库船将在明年2月设立，一座浮船坞也将随后设置。英国海军部在同一天晚上发表声明说，英美两国关于建立“北极星”导弹基地的协定没有固定的时限，这个基地将驻有一千五百名美国人员，潜水艇上的人员不计在内。预计，第一艘这种美国潜水艇将在明年3月初到达这个基地。
    麦克米伦在他的讲话中力图为英国把自己绑在美国的战车上的政策辩解。他说：“我有责任向下院提出警告，在我们实现国际裁军以前，如果放松西方的防务——而核威慑力量是构成这种防务的一个重要部分——那将是愚蠢的”。麦克米伦承认，建立美国“北极星”导弹基地“似乎可能增加不安的情绪”。但是，他希望议会同意这样做，因为“我们没有其他的办法”，如果拒绝这项协定，那就是不符合西方联盟的精神的。他说，“我们将在所有这一切防御问题上继续依靠我们和美国的密切合作和谅解”。
    麦克米伦掩饰说，“不论这些
  （美国）潜水艇可能在甚么地方，我完全确信，事先若不经过可能是最充分的磋商，不会作出使用这种导弹的决定。”但是，美国当局对麦克米伦的这番话“感到意外”。美国国务院官员说，当谈到建立这个基地的时候，并没有作出这种许诺。
    三个苏格兰的工党议员打断了麦克米伦的发言。其中一个议员指出，苏格兰将感到很大的愤慨，因为人民不想受到毁灭的威胁。另一个议员质问麦克米伦是否要在苏格兰就此举行公民投票。麦克米伦回答说，“不”，他还说，“我甚至不愿在反对党中进行公民投票”。
