    U.S. Has a Base for Aggression Against Cuba in Guatemala
    Xinhua News Agency, November 16th -- According to TASS, New York: The latest issue of the American weekly "The Nation" reveals that the United States is preparing to attack Cuba from Guatemalan territory.
    The weekly writes that Dr. Hilton, director of the Spanish-American Institute at Stanford University in the United States, learned during a recent trip to Guatemala that "the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency spent more than a million dollars to buy a large piece of land, surrounded by high walls and heavily guarded." "The Guatemalans 'all know' that this land is used as a firing range to train Cuban counter-revolutionaries preparing to attack Cuba." This base, preparing for aggression against Cuba, is equipped with American weapons and managed by Americans.
    The weekly concludes by writing that Guatemalan President Ydígoras recently admitted that such a base exists.
