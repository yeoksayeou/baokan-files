"Confidant" and "Considerate Person"
    ——Comrade Sent to the Front Lines to Support Agricultural Production
    Ge Song

    The commune members love to call the cadres they trust "confidants," referring to them as "confidant secretary," "confidant team leader," "confidant accountant," and so on.

      "Confidant," what a kind and glorious title! For a Communist Party member, a Communist Youth League member, a revolutionary cadre, to be regarded by the people as a confidant, to have their hearts entrusted to you, to follow you, to regard you as the representative of the Party's policies and the embodiment of the Party's ideology, dear comrades, please think about it, is there any title more fitting than this to describe the inseparable relationship between cadres and the masses? Isn't this the greatest happiness for comrades working in the countryside?

      "Confidant" is a conclusion and evaluation made by the masses about cadres based on their production labor, work, life, and long-term contact. They carefully observe you, observing from your standpoint, ideology, emotions, style, and even your words and deeds, to see if you are truly dedicating yourself wholeheartedly to the socialist construction of the countryside, and whether you truly deserve the qualification of being a "confidant" of the working people. Some comrades have been in the countryside for a year, two years, or three years, and have done a lot of work, but in the final analysis, they are in the countryside physically, but their hearts are in the city, and they have not given their hearts to the commune. In this case, how can one even begin to talk about becoming a "confidant" of the farmers!

    To be a "confidant" of the farmers, having determination alone is not enough. One must first be a "considerate person." What kind of heart? First of all, one must have a proletarian revolutionary red heart, a heart dedicated to building rural people's communes and changing the face of the countryside. Then, one must learn many things one does not understand, and one must care about and study many things related to production and life. New things, new experiences, and new problems constantly emerge in the countryside, and one must treat them with the correct attitude; new contradictions will also constantly arise, and one must solve them with the correct methods. A "considerate person" truly uses their heart to get close to the commune members, paying attention to even the most minute aspects of their lives. "All practical problems in the life of the masses are problems we should pay attention to. If we pay attention to these problems, solve them, and satisfy the needs of the masses, we shall really become organizers of the masses, and the masses will really rally around us and warmly support us." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. 1, pp. 131-132) These are the words that Chairman Mao said more than twenty years ago. Chairman Mao cared about the lives of the masses, considering even matters like firewood, rice, oil, salt, children's education, and sores and illnesses. "All these problems concerning the life of the masses should be placed on our agenda. They should be discussed, decisions must be made, and the decisions must be carried out and examined. We must make the broad masses realize that we represent their interests, that we are of one heart and mind with them." (Ibid., p. 133) To be of one heart and mind with the masses, one must become a "considerate person." Otherwise, turning a blind eye and a deaf ear, even if one works hard every day, one will still not be able to do the job better, and of course, it will be even more difficult to become a "confidant" of the masses.

    These are not trivial matters of life; they are major issues related to our entire revolutionary cause and the entire socialist and communist construction. Otherwise, why did Chairman Mao praise the comrades in Xingguo and other places in those years for "truly taking responsibility in the face of the revolution"?

    “知心人”和“有心人”
    ——五送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    公社社员们爱把他们所信赖的干部叫作“知心人”，称他们为“知心书记”、“知心队长”、“知心会计”……
      “知心人”，这是个多么亲切而又多么光荣的称号。对于一个共产党员、共青团员、革命干部来说，被人民群众引为知心、把心都交给你，跟着你走，把你当作执行党的政策、贯彻党的思想的代表人，亲爱的同志，请你想一想，还有什么比这个称号更能恰当地说明干部和群众之间的鱼水关系呢？这难道不是我们在农村工作的同志的最大幸福吗？
      “知心人”，是群众从生产劳动中、从工作中、生活中、从长期接触中对干部下的结论，做的鉴定。他们细心地观察你，从你的立场、思想、感情、作风以至于一言一行里观察你，看你是不是真正把自己全身心都交给农村的社会主义建设，是不是真正够得上劳动人民的“知心人”的资格。有的同志在农村一年、两年、三年，也做了不少工作，但是归根结底，他身在农村、心在城市，并没有把心交给公社。这样，欲求做农民的“知心人”，又从何谈起！
    做农民的“知心人”，光有决心，也还不行。还得先做“有心人”。有什么心？首先要有一颗无产阶级的革命红心，要有一颗立志建设农村人民公社、改变农村面貌的忠心。然后，要去学习许多不懂的东西，要去关心、研究生产和生活上的许多事情。农村里不断出现新的事物、新的经验，新的问题，要用正确的态度去对待；也会不断出现新的矛盾，要用正确的方法去解决。“有心人”真正是用心去贴近社员，注意社员的那怕是最细微的生活问题。“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。假如我们对这些问题注意了，解决了，满足了群众的需要，我们就真正成了群众的组织者，群众就会真正围绕在我们的周围，热烈地拥护我们。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷131—132页）这是毛主席在二十多年前说的话。毛主席关怀群众的生活，把柴米油盐、小孩读书、生疮害病这样的事都考虑了。“一切这些群众生活上的问题，都应该把它提到自己的议事日程上。应该讨论，应该决定，应该实行，应该检查。要使广大群众认识我们是代表他们的利益的，是和他们呼吸相通的。”（同上，133页）做到和群众呼吸相通，就一定要成为一个“有心人”。否则，视而不见，听而不闻，纵使每天辛辛苦苦，也还是不能把工作做得更好，当然也就更难成为群众的“知心人”了。
    这不是生活小事，是有关我们整个革命事业、整个社会主义、共产主义建设的大事。要不，为什么毛主席称赞当年兴国和其他一些地方的同志们“在革命面前是真正负起了责任”呢？
