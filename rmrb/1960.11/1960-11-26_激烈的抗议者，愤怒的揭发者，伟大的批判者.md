    A Fierce Protester, an Angry Expositor, a Great Critic
    Mao Dun
    Fifty years ago, Leo Nikolayevich Tolstoy passed away at the age of eighty-two. This great writer raised so many significant questions in his works, achieving such great artistic power, that his creation occupies an extremely important position in world classical literature, "becoming a step forward in the development of human art" (Lenin: "L.N. Tolstoy").
    Tolstoy's life was one of a fierce protester, an angry expositor, and a great critic. His relentless exposure of the Tsarist autocracy and the official church, his firm negation of the landlord class's land ownership system, and his strong protest against capitalism reached such a degree that the Russian bourgeois reactionary writer Suvorin worriedly expressed his fear: "We have two emperors, one is Nicholas II, and the other is Leo Tolstoy. Which of the two is more powerful? Nicholas II is completely powerless against Tolstoy, he cannot shake the latter's throne, while Tolstoy, without a doubt, is shaking Nicholas's throne and his dynasty."
    In nearly sixty years of creative activity, Tolstoy wrote a large number of profound and beautifully formed works, leaving humanity a very rich literary legacy. He absorbed the beneficial nutrients of the critical realism school laid down by Pushkin and developed by Lermontov, especially Gogol. At the same time, he also drew on the achievements of world literature masters such as Stendhal and Dickens. On the other hand, Tolstoy's creation had a great influence on the development of Soviet Russian literature and the literature of other Soviet nationalities. Traces of the Tolstoy tradition can be felt in many works by famous Soviet writers. Tolstoy also made a great contribution to the development of world literature, especially the literary style of the novel. Tolstoy was an artistic master who broadly and multi-facetedly reflected reality. In his epic works, the magnificent and majestic picture of the Russian people's patriotic war, ordinary daily life scenes, numerous character images and their connections and conflicts, and the in-depth depiction of their appearance and inner world are intricately intertwined, forming an extraordinarily full and lifelike picture of the life of the times. In his novels with contemporary social life as the theme, he summarized extremely complex social phenomena with astonishing artistic power, revealed the internal connections between various complex phenomena, and raised many major social issues. The grand scale, complex structure, delicate psychological analysis, rich techniques for expressing psychological activities, and unique method of ruthlessly tearing off all masks in Tolstoy's works greatly improved the possibility of artistic works reflecting reality and enriched and developed the realistic artistic creation method. Tolstoy's artistic skills are something that writers from all countries are willing to learn.
    In our country, Tolstoy is one of the most beloved foreign writers among the broad masses of readers. Tolstoy's works have been circulating in our country for more than fifty years. According to research by experts in Sino-Russian literary friendship, Tolstoy's short stories were translated into Chinese and published in Shanghai publications as early as 1906. In the twelve years that followed, Tolstoy's works began to be published successively in the form of abridged or translated single editions, including "Resurrection," "A Landowner's Morning," "The Death of Ivan Ilyich," "Sevastopol Stories," "Anna Karenina," "Childhood," "Boyhood," "Youth," "The Kreutzer Sonata," and "Family Happiness," a total of thirteen kinds.
    After the May Fourth Movement in 1919, due to the needs of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, and also due to the needs of the literary revolution movement, the work of introducing foreign literature, especially Russian literature, was further expanded. More of Tolstoy's works were introduced, and translations of "The Power of Darkness," "The Fruits of Enlightenment," "War and Peace," and others were successively produced.
    Our country's revolutionary literary workers attached great importance to Tolstoy. They fully estimated the ideological significance and artistic value of his creation. Lu Xun once emphasized Tolstoy's spirit of writing "for the present." Qu Qiubai believed that Tolstoy "opened up a unique brilliance in the history of human literature." When I started writing novels, I relied on some foreign novels I had read before, and among Russian writers, I loved reading Tolstoy and Chekhov the most.
    During the difficult conditions of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the work of introducing Tolstoy's works continued without interruption. His works gained more and more readers. The vast majority of artistic works have already been translated, and most of them have more than two translations.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the work of introducing foreign literature achieved unprecedentedly favorable conditions. The translations of many of Tolstoy's works have been revised, and some works have been re-translated. The study of Tolstoy conducted according to the Marxist-Leninist principle of critically inheriting literary heritage has also taken its first step. The people of our country cherish Tolstoy's works as a literary legacy.
    The era in which Tolstoy lived was an era full of drastic social changes and fierce class struggles. The failure of Tsarist Russia in the Crimean War from 1853 to 1856 further deepened the crisis of the serf system economy. In the early 1860s, the tide of peasant uprisings forced the Tsarist government to announce the abolition of serfdom. The accelerated development of the capitalist economy caused rural bankruptcy, and coupled with the influence of the remaining forces of the serf system, the lives of millions of peasants had fallen into despair. All of this could not but have a great impact on a realist who had keen eyes and inherited the progressive tradition of close ties between Russian literature and the people's liberation movement, and naturally could not but be reflected in his works.
    Tolstoy exposed and criticized the Russian aristocratic landlord class with tremendous artistic power in his works. His exposure was closely linked to his broad depiction of the lives of this class. The political and economic system, daily life, spiritual outlook, family, marriage, love, and all other areas of life of the aristocratic landlord class were vividly presented in Tolstoy's works. When describing the life of the aristocratic landlord class, Tolstoy showed the attitude of "the clearest realism," ruthlessly "tearing off all masks" (Lenin: "Leo Tolstoy is the Mirror of the Russian Revolution"), and exposing the sins of the aristocratic landlord class and its social system. Tolstoy fiercely criticized the decadent parasitic life of the aristocratic landlord class, their moral depravity, and the poverty of their spiritual life. In "War and Peace," he exposed the corruption of the Tsarist court and some upper-class nobles, their extreme selfishness and their indifference to the fate of the motherland. The Russian people were engaged in a life-and-death duel with the invader Napoleon, "but the quiet, luxurious St. Petersburg life, which only cared about the illusion of life, continued as usual; living this kind of life required great effort to recognize the danger and plight of the Russian people. There were still receptions and balls, still French theaters, still the interests of the court, the interests of errands and intrigues." ("War and Peace," Volume IV, Part I) And some of the aristocratic generals who commanded the army to fight were preoccupied with the struggle for power and profit. Tolstoy showed that this part of the Russian aristocracy had lost all patriotic feelings and the possibility of establishing heroic deeds. They were incompetent and had no right to shoulder the important task of saving Russia.
    In the process of his creation, Tolstoy constantly expanded and deepened his exposure and criticism of the aristocratic landlord class. In "Anna Karenina," he depicted several groups of upper-class aristocratic society and their representatives. Through the various representatives of aristocratic society, Tolstoy profoundly revealed the common characteristics of upper-class aristocratic life: parasitism, decay, and emptiness. Their lives were like stagnant water, and luxurious balls, flirting between men and women, creating and spreading rumors, and pursuing fame and fortune were the unchanging content of their lives.
    In "Resurrection," Tolstoy's exposure had turned into a scathing satire and fierce attack on the aristocratic landlord class. The characteristic of ruthlessly tearing off all masks was most powerfully expressed in "Resurrection." Through the contrast between the poverty of the vast number of peasants and the luxurious life of the aristocratic landlord class, Tolstoy not only exposed the sins of parasitic life and the hypocritical faces of the exploiting classes, but also strongly criticized the exploiting class's state, courts, prisons, police, and the official church that maintained the interests of the exploiting class, ruthlessly exposed the extreme corruption and selfishness of officials at all levels of the Tsarist government, and their fierce brutality towards the people, and fiercely condemned the unreasonableness of the landlord class's land ownership system, advocating the elimination of private ownership of land. However, Tolstoy did not believe that to abolish the landlord class's land ownership system, it was first necessary to overthrow the landlord class's regime—the autocratic system of Tsarist Russia. He fantasized that this could be achieved through the "moral self-cultivation" of the representatives of the landlord class and awakening them to recognize their own sins.
    From the abolition of serfdom to the 1905 revolution, it was an era of rapid development of capitalism in Russia. Capitalist relations had penetrated into all aspects of Russian social life. Capitalism destroyed the old patriarchal foundations of life, and the power of money grew unprecedentedly. The relationship between people became a naked money relationship. All old moral concepts were also shaken. All of this aroused Tolstoy's extraordinary aversion and fear of capitalism. In his works, on the one hand, he depicted the development of capitalism in Russia, and on the other hand, he launched a fierce attack on capitalism. He constantly cursed the power of money, and exposed the hypocrisy of bourgeois morality and law.
    Tolstoy expressed deep sympathy and concern for the situation of the working people and colonial people of various countries under the world capitalist system, and fiercely criticized the world capitalist system. In his early work "Lucerne," the essay "Definition of Progress and Education" in the 1860s, and especially many political articles after the 1880s, such as "Modern Slavery," he made a pointed exposure of the hypocritical slogans of "freedom, democracy, and equality" touted by the bourgeoisie. He pointed out that in capitalist society, so-called "freedom, democracy, and equality" are nothing but the privileges of millionaires. Tolstoy called the capitalist system "Modern Slavery," which is a very accurate metaphor.
    In the later period of Tolstoy's creation, world capitalism had developed into imperialism. In many political articles and letters of this period, Tolstoy angrily condemned the predatory wars waged by the imperialists. His fierce attack on the Spanish-American War launched by the US imperialists in 1898 to seize colonies is a clear example of his opposition to imperialist predatory wars and his sympathy for the enslaved people of the colonies. Due to the limitations of Tolstoy's worldview by the historical era and class, the road he pointed out for the colonial people to seek liberation is unacceptable to us. However, today, when the imperialist camp headed by the United States is frantically suppressing and undermining the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, his exposure of the imperialists half a century ago helps us to understand the true face of the imperialists from history.
    Under the social systems of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, the fate of millions of peasants has always agitated Tolstoy. Depicting the lives and thoughts of peasants and seeking ways to improve the living conditions of peasants is one of the important contents of all of Tolstoy's creations. In his early work "A Landowner's Morning," he depicted the tragic situation of peasants under the serf system. The abolition of the serf system in 1861 not only did not improve the situation of the peasants, but instead made the peasants more dependent on the landlords. The rapid development of capitalism accelerated the bankruptcy of the peasants. Therefore, Tolstoy raised this issue more and more sharply in his works. In "Resurrection," Tolstoy reflected the extremely impoverished lives of Russian peasants and the tragic scene of the bankruptcy of the Russian countryside after the serfdom reform through the protagonist of the novel, Nekhlyudov.
    Tolstoy not only vividly depicted the miserable fate of the vast number of Russian peasants in the landlord bourgeois society, but also created many peasant images. Through these images, he profoundly revealed the changes that had taken place in the thoughts and emotions of the vast number of Russian peasant masses in the period of preparation for the bourgeois revolution. In many works, Tolstoy depicted the peasants' strong demand for land. In "Anna Karenina," he vividly depicted the great interest and enthusiasm shown by peasants when working on their own land and the resistance they produced when working for landlords. The increasingly strong hatred and animosity towards the reactionary ruling class is a prominent common feature of many peasant images created by Tolstoy. In works such as "A Landowner's Morning," "Anna Karenina," "The Fruits of Enlightenment," and "Resurrection," Tolstoy portrayed various peasant images, but the hatred and suspicion of the landlords were common. They were always highly vigilant about any proposals of the landlords and held a stubborn attitude of resistance.
    In the scenes of people's lives depicted by Tolstoy, he not only expressed the tragic situation of the people, but also showed the noble moral qualities of the working people and the great role of the people in history in works such as "Sevastopol Stories" and "War and Peace." In these works, Tolstoy saw true patriotism and fearless heroism not in most of the so-called educated aristocratic officers, but in the most ordinary soldiers. In "War and Peace," he wrote down the glorious pages of the Russian people rising up to defend their motherland. In this epic, when describing events of great significance to the fate of Russia, such as the Battle of Borodino and the people's guerrilla warfare, he showed that the masses of the people were the true defenders of Russia, and that the masses of the people saved Russia, not the upper-class aristocratic society and the Tsar. Tolstoy believed that all excellent moral qualities could only be found among the working people, and that the working people were the source of all moral strength.
    In Tolstoy's depiction of Russian peasant life, the images he created reflect the profound contradictions in his worldview. On the one hand, he expressed the growing anger of the vast number of peasants in his works, and praised the active struggle of the Russian people to defend their motherland. On the other hand, through a series of peasant images under the Russian patriarchal system such as Karataev ("War and Peace") and Akim ("The Power of Darkness"), he idealized those negative and backward factors in the thoughts and emotions of the Russian peasants under the patriarchal system who had not yet awakened politically, and promoted negative and backward ideas such as resignation, submission to fate, and "non-resistance to evil."
    For more than half a century, Tolstoy relentlessly exposed and criticized the reactionary landlord bourgeois society in Russia, the society that enslaved the vast number of working people. His cry of protest aroused a huge response among progressive people all over the world. His exposure was powerful because he expressed the hatred of millions of bankrupt patriarchal peasants in Russia towards the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, and their growing revolutionary emotions with his outstanding artistic talent. His strong condemnation of the landlord bourgeois land ownership system precisely reflected the peasants' desire for land. His criticism of capitalism reflected the peasants' protest against capitalism in the face of the threat of bankruptcy. Lenin said: "Through his mouth spoke the millions of people of the whole of Russia" (Lenin: "Tolstoy and the Proletarian Struggle"). Here, Lenin pointed out the connection between Tolstoy's criticism and the thoughts and emotions of millions of peasant masses in the period of preparation for the Russian bourgeois revolution. Tolstoy's criticism of the reactionary ruling class had its progressive significance in history. When the vast number of working people in Russia were gathering strength to prepare to throw themselves into the decisive battle against the Tsarist autocracy, his exposure and criticism were undoubtedly a serious blow to the reactionary forces and a contribution to the liberation movement.
    However, Tolstoy's criticism of the landlord bourgeoisie proceeded from the point of view of the Russian patriarchal peasants. Therefore, in his criticism, he not only expressed the protests and anger of millions of patriarchal peasants in the period of preparation for the Russian bourgeois revolution, "but even brought their naiveté, their indifference to politics, their mysticism, their desire to escape the real world, their 'non-resistance to evil,' and their powerless curse against capitalism and 'the power of money' into his own doctrine" (Lenin: "L.N. Tolstoy and the Modern Labor Movement"). From the point of view of the peasants under the patriarchal system, Tolstoy could not historically and specifically analyze the social causes of the evil phenomena he criticized and find the correct methods to eliminate evil. He attributed complex social problems and class struggle problems to eternal abstract moral problems. He believed that the occurrence of all evil phenomena was because people violated God's law—brotherly love, and admitted that some people could use violence against others for their own benefit. In this case, Tolstoy believed that the only way to free people from evil was to make "everyone always admit that they are guilty before God" ("Resurrection"). Therefore, not only should one not punish others, but one should forgive others and love one's enemies. In this way, violence and evil would automatically disappear, and a society in which everyone is happy would be established. All of this is manifested in Tolstoy's creation as "moral self-cultivation," "non-resistance to evil by violence," and the crazy propaganda of so-called "purified" religion. Tolstoy's moral preaching was reactionary in the past and is reactionary now. Contrary to his ruthless exposure of landlord bourgeois society, the Tsarist autocratic system, and the official church with an attitude of "the clearest realism," here he used new religions and illusions about the reactionary ruling class to paralyze the oppressed masses. He did not call on the people to wage a resolute struggle against the reactionary autocratic system in Russia, but called on the oppressed people not only to endure and tolerate all the sins and atrocities of the reactionary ruling class, but also to always forgive and love their enemies and not to carry out revolution. Tolstoy's doctrine and moral preaching in literary creation in fact consolidated the reactionary social system that he relentlessly exposed.
    Tolstoy's strong protest and relentless exposure of the reactionary ruling class constituted a sharp contradiction with his doctrine of "non-resistance to evil." But it cannot be considered that this contradiction is accidental or entirely his personal contradiction. Just as the strength of Tolstoy's worldview and artistic creation reflected the strength of most Russian patriarchal peasants in the period of preparation for the bourgeois revolution, Tolstoy's weakness was also the weakness of most Russian patriarchal peasants, their lack of political awareness. Of course, it should not be ignored that Tolstoy's aristocratic landlord class background influenced his worldview and artistic creation.
    Despite the great defects in the thoughts expressed in Tolstoy's works, the flaws do not obscure the jade. His creation still provokes deep thought, excites people, and still shines with immortal brilliance.
    When we commemorate Tolstoy, we should first correctly evaluate Tolstoy's legacy from the perspective and method of Marxism-Leninism, and thoroughly expose the distortion and utilization of Tolstoy by modern revisionists in literature. We should carefully study and inherit the brilliant achievements of Tolstoy's realistic art to enrich our literary cultivation and improve our writing skills. At the same time, we should also carry forward Tolstoy's hatred of feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism, his hatred of exploiters, oppressors, and parasites, his love for the motherland, and his love for the people in a new sense and under new conditions. Lenin said that in Tolstoy's legacy "there is something that has not become the past but belongs to the future. The Russian proletariat must accept this legacy and study this legacy." (Lenin: "L.N. Tolstoy") This sentence is still applicable to progressive humanity around the world in critically inheriting this legacy in the future.
    Fifty years ago, when Tolstoy left this world, the vast number of working people in his motherland were still groaning under the cruel exploitation of landlords and capitalists, living a miserable life. But fifty years later, when people commemorate this talented artist with incomparable respect, the feudal system and capitalist system that he deeply hated have not only been uprooted on a quarter of the earth, but the days of their final elimination throughout the world are also not far off. Facing such an era, we should create more and better works that are both rich in ideology and rich in artistry, and contribute our strength to the great cause of defending world peace and striving for democracy and socialism.

    激烈的抗议者，愤怒的揭发者，伟大的批判者
    茅盾
    五十年以前，列甫·尼古拉耶维奇·托尔斯泰以八十二岁的高龄与世长辞了。这位伟大作家在他的作品里提出了这么多重大的问题，达到了这样大的艺术力量，使他的创作在世界古典文学中占了一个极端重要的位置，“成为全人类艺术发展中向前跨进的一步了”（列宁：《列·尼·托尔斯泰》）。
    托尔斯泰的一生是一个激烈的抗议者、愤怒的揭发者和伟大的批判者的一生。他对沙皇专制政体和官方教会的无情揭露、对地主阶级土地占有制的坚决否定、对资本主义的强烈抗议，达到了这样的程度，以致俄国资产阶级反动文人苏沃林忧心忡忡地表示了他的恐惧：“我们有两个皇帝，一个是尼古拉二世，一个是列甫·托尔斯泰。他们两个中间谁更有力呢？尼古拉二世对托尔斯泰是完全无能为力的，他无法动摇后者的宝座，而托尔斯泰，毫无疑问，却正在动摇尼古拉的宝座和他的皇朝。”
    托尔斯泰在将近六十年的创作活动中写出了大量内容深刻、形式优美的作品，给人类留下了一笔非常丰富的文学遗产。他吸取了普希金所奠定，而由莱蒙托夫、特别是果戈理所发展了的批判现实主义流派的有益营养。同时，他也从世界文学如司汤达、狄更斯等大师所达到的成就中取得借鉴。另一方面，托尔斯泰的创作又对苏维埃俄罗斯文学和苏联其他各民族文学的发展起了很大的影响，在许多苏联名作家的身上都可以感到托尔斯泰传统的痕迹。对世界文学，特别是对长篇小说这个文学样式的发展，托尔斯泰也作出了巨大的贡献。托尔斯泰是广阔地多方面地反映现实的艺术巨匠。在他的史诗式的作品中，俄罗斯人民的卫国战争的波澜壮阔的雄伟画面和平凡的日常生活场面、众多的人物形象和他们之间的联系及冲突、他们的外貌和内心世界的深入刻划都错综复杂地交织在一起，构成一幅异常丰满的栩栩如生的时代生活的图画。他在以当代社会生活为题材的小说中，以惊人的艺术力量概括了极其纷繁的社会现象，并且揭示出各种复杂现象之间的内在联系，提出许多重大的社会问题。托尔斯泰作品的宏伟的规模、复杂的结构、细腻的心理分析、表现心理活动的丰富手法以及他的无情地撕毁一切假面具的独特手法，都大大提高了艺术作品反映现实的可能性，丰富和发展了现实主义的艺术创作方法。托尔斯泰的艺术技巧是世界各国的作家愿意学习的。
    在我国，托尔斯泰是广大读者最喜爱的外国作家之一。托尔斯泰的作品在我国的流传，也有五十多年的历史了。据研究中俄文学友谊的专家的考查，托尔斯泰的短篇小说早在1906年就已经被译成中文发表在上海的刊物上。在此后的十二年中，托尔斯泰的作品开始以节译本或译述的单行本的方式陆续出版，有《复活》、《一个地主的早晨》、《伊凡·伊里奇之死》、《塞瓦斯托波尔的故事》、《安娜·卡列尼娜》、《幼年》、《少年》、《青年》、《克莱采奏鸣曲》和《家庭幸福》等十三种。
    1919年“五四”运动以后，由于反帝、反封建的斗争需要，也由于文学革命运动的需要，外国文学，特别是俄罗斯文学的介绍工作进一步展开。托尔斯泰的作品介绍过来的更多了，《黑暗的势力》、《教育的果实》、《战争与和平》等都陆续有了译本。
    我国革命的文学工作者对托尔斯泰是十分重视的，他们都充分估计到他的创作的思想意义和艺术价值。鲁迅曾强调指出托尔斯泰“为现在”而写作的精神。瞿秋白认为托尔斯泰“开人类文学史的异彩”。我自己开始写小说时的凭借，是以前读过的一些外国小说，而在俄国作家中间，最爱读的是托尔斯泰和契呵夫。
    在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争时期的艰苦条件下，托尔斯泰作品的介绍工作继续进行，丝毫没有中断。他的作品获得愈来愈多的读者。绝大部分的艺术作品，都已经有了译本，而且大部分有两个以上的译本。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，外国文学介绍工作取得了空前有利的条件，托尔斯泰的不少作品的译本都经过了校订，有的作品还重新进行了翻译。根据马克思列宁主义批判继承文学遗产的原则进行的托尔斯泰研究工作也跨出了第一步。我国人民是珍视托尔斯泰的作品这笔文学遗产的。
    托尔斯泰所处的时代是充满了急剧的社会变革与激烈的阶级斗争的时代。1853到1856年沙皇俄国在克里米亚战争中的失败，进一步加深了农奴制经济的危机。六十年代初，农民起义的浪潮迫使沙皇政府宣布废除农奴制。资本主义经济的加速发展，引起了农村破产，再加上农奴制残余势力的影响，千百万农民的生活已经陷入了绝境。这一切不能不对一个具有敏锐的眼光、继承了俄罗斯文学与人民解放运动密切联系的进步传统的现实主义者产生极大的影响，自然也不能不在他的作品中得到反应。
    托尔斯泰在自己的作品中以巨大的艺术力量揭露和抨击了俄国的贵族地主阶级。他的揭露是与他对这个阶级的生活的广泛描绘密切结合在一起的。贵族地主阶级的政治经济制度，日常生活，精神面貌，家庭、婚姻、爱情等一切生活领域，在托尔斯泰的作品中都生动地呈现了出来。托尔斯泰在描写贵族地主阶级的生活时，表现了“最清醒的现实主义”态度，无情地“撕下了一切假面具”（列宁：《列甫·托尔斯泰是俄国革命的镜子》），暴露了贵族地主阶级及其社会制度的罪恶。托尔斯泰猛烈地抨击了贵族地主阶级的腐朽的寄生生活、他们的道德堕落、精神生活的贫乏。在《战争与和平》中，他揭露了沙皇朝廷和一部分上层贵族的腐败、极端的自私自利和他们对祖国命运的漠不关心。俄罗斯的人民正在同侵略者拿破仑进行生死存亡的决斗，“但是安静的、奢华的、只关心生活的幻影的彼得堡生活，照旧地进行着；由于过着这种生活，要作很大的努力才能认识俄国人民所遭的危险和所处的困境。照旧有招待会和舞会，照旧有法国戏院，照旧有宫廷的兴趣，差事和阴谋的兴趣”。（《战争与和平》第四卷第一部）而一部分指挥军队作战的贵族将领所念念不忘的则是争权夺利的斗争。托尔斯泰表明，俄国的这一部分贵族已丧失了一切爱国的情感和建立英雄事迹的可能。他们无能、也无权肩负拯救俄国的重任。
    托尔斯泰在创作过程中不断地扩大和加深了对贵族地主阶级的揭露和批判。在《安娜·卡列尼娜》中他描绘了上层贵族社会的几个集团和它们的代表人物。通过贵族社会的形形色色的代表人物，托尔斯泰深刻地揭露了上层贵族生活的共同特点：寄生、腐朽、空虚。他们的生活像一潭死水，豪华的舞会、男女之间的调情、制造和传播流言蜚语、追逐名利是他们的生活的永远不变的内容。
    在《复活》中，托尔斯泰的揭露已变成了对贵族地主阶级的辛辣的讽刺和猛烈的抨击。无情地撕毁一切假面具的特点在《复活》中最有力地表现了出来。通过广大农民的贫困生活与贵族地主阶级的奢华生活的对照，托尔斯泰不但揭露了寄生生活的罪恶和剥削阶级的伪善面孔，而且强烈地抨击了剥削阶级的国家、法庭、监狱、警察以及维护剥削阶级利益的官方教会，无情地揭露了沙皇政府各级官吏的极端腐败、自私自利和他们对待人民的凶恶残暴，猛烈地谴责了地主阶级的土地占有制度的不合理，主张消灭土地的私有制。但是，托尔斯泰并不认为，要废除地主阶级的土地占有制，首先就必须打倒地主阶级的政权——沙皇俄国的专制制度。他幻想通过地主阶级的代表在“道德上的自我修养”和唤醒他们认识自己的罪恶的办法来达到这个目的。
    从废除农奴制到1905年革命，是资本主义在俄国迅速发展的时代。资本主义关系已经渗透到俄国社会生活的各个方面。资本主义摧毁了旧的宗法制的生活基础，金钱的势力空前增长了。人和人之间的关系变成了赤裸裸的金钱关系。一切旧的道德观念也在动摇了。这一切都引起了托尔斯泰对资本主义的异常憎恶和恐惧。他在自己的作品中，一方面，描绘了资本主义在俄国的发展，另一方面，也对资本主义展开了激烈的攻击。他不断对金钱势力发出诅咒，揭露资产阶级的道德、法律的虚伪。
    托尔斯泰对处在世界资本主义制度下的各国劳动人民和殖民地人民的处境表示了深切的同情和关怀，对世界资本主义制度进行了猛烈的抨击。他在自己的早期作品《琉森》、六十年代的论文《进步与教育的定义》、特别是八十年代以后的许多政论文章如《当代的奴隶制》中，对资产阶级所标榜的“自由、民主、平等”的虚伪口号都做了一针见血的揭露。他指出，在资本主义社会里，所谓“自由、民主、平等”不过是百万富翁的特权。托尔斯泰把资本主义制度称为《当代的奴隶制》，这是非常确切的比喻。
    在托尔斯泰创作的后期，世界资本主义已发展为帝国主义。托尔斯泰在这个时期的许多政论文章和书信中都愤怒地谴责了帝国主义者所进行的掠夺战争。他对美帝国主义者在1898年为争夺殖民地而挑起的美西战争所发出的猛烈抨击，就是他反对帝国主义的掠夺战争和同情殖民地被奴役人民的一个鲜明例子。由于托尔斯泰的世界观受着历史时代和阶级的限制，他给殖民地人民所指出的求得解放的道路，是我们不能接受的。但是，今天，当以美国为首的帝国主义阵营正在疯狂地镇压和破坏亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲等地的民族解放运动的时候，他在半个世纪以前对帝国主义者所作的揭露，是有助于我们从历史上去认识帝国主义者的真面目的。
    在地主阶级和资产阶级的社会制度下，千百万农民的命运问题始终在激动着托尔斯泰。描绘农民的生活和思想情绪、寻求改善农民生活处境的方法，是托尔斯泰的全部创作的重要内容之一。他在他的早期作品《一个地主的早晨》中就描绘了农奴制度下农民的悲惨境遇。1861年农奴制的废除不但没有改善农民的境遇，相反地更加使农民依附于地主。资本主义的迅速发展则加速了农民的破产。因此，托尔斯泰在自己的作品里愈来愈尖锐地提出了这个问题。在《复活》中，托尔斯泰通过小说的主人公聂赫留朵夫反映了俄国农民的极端贫困的生活和农奴制改革后俄国农村破产的凄惨景象。
    托尔斯泰不仅生动地描绘了俄国广大农民在地主资产阶级社会里的悲惨命运，而且创造了许多农民的形象。通过这些形象，他深刻地揭示了在资产阶级革命准备时期俄国广大农民群众在思想情绪上所发生的变化。在许多作品中，托尔斯泰都描绘了农民对土地的强烈要求。在《安娜·卡列尼娜》中，他生动地描绘出农民在自己的土地上劳动时所表现出来的巨大兴趣、积极性和给地主劳动时所产生的抵抗情绪。对反动统治阶级的日益强烈的憎恨、仇视的心理是托尔斯泰所创造的许多农民形象的显著的共同特点。在《一个地主的早晨》、《安娜·卡列尼娜》、《教育的果实》、《复活》等作品中，托尔斯泰刻划了各种各样的农民形象，但对地主的憎恨、怀疑的态度却是共同的。他们对地主的任何提议时时刻刻都怀着高度的戒备心理，抱着顽强的抵抗态度。
    在托尔斯泰所描绘的人民生活的场面中，他不只是表现了人民的悲惨境遇，他在《塞瓦斯托波尔的故事》和《战争与和平》等作品中也显示了劳动人民的崇高的道德品质和人民在历史上的伟大作用。在这些作品中，托尔斯泰不是在大多数所谓有教养的贵族军官的身上，而是在最普通的士兵身上看到了真正的爱国主义和大无畏的英雄气概。在《战争与和平》中，他写下了俄罗斯人民奋起保卫祖国的光辉史页。在这部史诗中，他在描写例如鲍罗琴诺战役和人民游击战争等对俄罗斯的命运有重大意义的事件时表明，人民群众是俄罗斯的真正保卫者，人民群众挽救了俄罗斯，而不是上层的贵族社会和沙皇。托尔斯泰认为一切优良的道德品质只有在劳动人民中间才可以找到，劳动人民才是一切道德力量的泉源。
    在托尔斯泰对俄国农民生活的描绘中，在他所创造的形象里都反映出他的世界观中的深刻矛盾。一方面，他在自己的作品中表达了广大农民的日益增长着的愤怒情绪，歌颂了俄国人民保卫祖国的积极斗争，另一方面，他通过卡拉塔耶夫（《战争与和平》）、阿吉姆（《黑暗的势力》）等一系列俄国宗法制度下农民的形象，理想化了在政治上还没觉醒的俄国宗法制度下农民的思想情绪中那些消极落后的因素，宣扬逆来顺受、听天由命、“不抗恶”等消极落后的思想。
    大半个世纪以来，托尔斯泰对俄国的反动地主资产阶级社会，那个使广大劳动人民受奴役的社会，进行了不倦的揭露和批判。他的抗议的呼声在全世界的进步人士中间引起了巨大的反响。他的揭露之所以有力，是因为他以自己的卓越的艺术天才表达了俄国千百万濒于破产的宗法制农民对地主阶级和资产阶级的愤恨、他们的日益增长的革命情绪。他对地主资产阶级的土地占有制的强烈谴责正是反映了农民渴望土地的情绪。他对资本主义的批判则反映了面临破产威胁的农民对资本主义的抗议。列宁说：“通过他的嘴说话的，是整个俄罗斯千百万人民群众”（列宁：《托尔斯泰和无产阶级斗争》）。列宁在这里指出了托尔斯泰的批判与俄国资产阶级革命准备时期千百万农民群众的思想情绪的联系。托尔斯泰对反动统治阶级的批判在历史上是有它的进步意义的。在俄国的广大劳动人民正在积聚力量准备投入反对沙皇专制制度的决战时，他的揭露和批判无疑是对反动势力的严重打击，是对解放运动的贡献。
    但是，托尔斯泰对地主资产阶级的批判是从俄国宗法制农民的观点出发的。因此，他在自己的批判中不但表达了俄国资产阶级革命准备时期千百万宗法制农民的抗议和愤怒，“甚至把他们的天真，他们对政治的漠视，他们的神秘主义，他们逃避现实世界的愿望，他们的‘对恶不抵抗’以及他们对资本主义和‘金钱势力’的无力咒骂，都带到自己的学说中去了”（列宁：《列·尼·托尔斯泰和现代工人运动》）。从宗法制度下农民的观点出发，托尔斯泰不可能历史地具体地分析产生他所批判的罪恶现象的社会原因并找出消灭罪恶的正确方法。他把复杂的社会问题，阶级斗争问题都归根于永恒的抽象的道德问题。他认为一切罪恶现象的产生，是因为人们违反了上帝的法律——博爱，承认一部分人可以为了自己的利益而对另外一部分施加暴力。既然这样，托尔斯泰认为，使人们摆脱罪恶的唯一出路，就是使“人人永远承认自己在上帝面前有罪”（《复活》）。因此不但不能惩罚别人，而且要饶恕别人，爱自己的敌人。这样，暴力和罪恶就会自动消灭，人人幸福的社会就会建立起来。这一切在托尔斯泰的创作中，就表现为“道德上的自我修养”、“勿以暴力抗恶”和所谓“净化”了的宗教的疯狂宣传。托尔斯泰的道德说教无论在过去和现在都是反动的。和他以“最清醒的现实主义”的态度对地主资产阶级社会、沙皇专制制度和官方教会所做的无情揭露相反，在这里他以新的宗教和对反动统治阶级的幻想来麻痹被压迫的群众。他不是号召人民与俄国反动的专制制度作坚决的斗争，而是号召被压迫的人民不但要逆来顺受，容忍反动统治阶级的一切罪恶和暴行，而且还要永远宽恕和热爱自己的敌人，不要进行革命。托尔斯泰的学说和文学创作中的道德说教事实上又巩固了他所无情揭露了的反动社会制度。
    托尔斯泰对反动统治阶级的强烈抗议和无情揭露同他的“不抗恶”的说教构成了尖锐的矛盾。但是不能认为这个矛盾是偶然的或者完全是他个人的矛盾，就像托尔斯泰的世界观与艺术创作中的力量是反映了大部分俄国宗法制度下农民在资产阶级革命准备时期的力量一样，托尔斯泰的弱点也是俄国大部分宗法制度下农民的弱点、他们在政治上的缺乏觉悟。当然，也不应忽视，托尔斯泰的贵族地主阶级的出身对他的世界观与艺术创作的影响。
    托尔斯泰作品中表现出来的思想，尽管有着很大的缺陷，但是瑕不掩瑜，他的创作仍旧发人深思，使人激动，仍旧闪耀着不灭的光芒。
    我们纪念托尔斯泰，首先应当以马克思列宁主义的观点、方法来正确评价托尔斯泰的遗产，彻底揭露文学上的现代修正主义者对托尔斯泰的歪曲、利用。我们应当认真研究和继承托尔斯泰的现实主义艺术的辉煌成就，以丰富我们的文学修养，提高我们的写作技巧。同时，我们也应当把托尔斯泰对封建主义、资本主义、帝国主义的憎恨，对剥削者、压迫者、寄生虫的憎恨，对祖国的热爱，对人民的热爱，在新的意义上、在新的条件下发扬光大起来。列宁说过，在托尔斯泰的遗产里“有着没有成为过去而是属于未来的东西。俄国无产阶级要接受这份遗产，要研究这份遗产。”（列宁：《列·尼·托尔斯泰》）这句话对于全世界进步人类在今后批判继承这份遗产来说，也仍是适用的。
    五十年前，当托尔斯泰离开这个世界的时候，他的祖国的广大劳动人民还在地主、资本家的残酷剥削下呻吟，过着悲惨的生活，而在五十年后的今天，当人们怀着无比崇敬的心情来纪念这位天才艺术家的时候，他所深恶痛绝的封建制度、资本主义制度不仅在全球四分之一的地面上已经被连根拔掉了，而且在整个世界范围内最后消灭的日子也为期不远了。面临着这样的时代，我们应该创造出更多更好的既富于思想性又富于艺术性的作品，为保卫世界和平、争取民主和社会主义的伟大事业贡献出我们的力量。
