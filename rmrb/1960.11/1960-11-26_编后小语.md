Editor's Note

　　The purpose of launching the column "We Are on the Front Line" is to invite comrades who are laboring and working on the agricultural production front line to talk about the tremendous changes currently taking place in the countryside, to talk about the spirit of the Great Leap Forward in the people's communes, and especially to talk about their own feelings on the front line. In this way, comrades participating in agricultural production on the front line can learn from each other's strengths and move forward side by side; for comrades who are not on the front line, they can encourage each other and support each other.

　　The countryside is a vast world. There are very rich things to write about and things worth writing about. We hope that comrades on the agricultural production front line will actively and enthusiastically support this column in their spare time from labor and work.

    编后小语
    开辟《我们在第一线》这一栏的目的，是想请一些正在农业生产第一线劳动和工作的同志，来谈谈当前农村的巨大变化，谈谈人民公社大跃进的风貌，特别是谈谈自己在第一线上的感受。这样，对参加农业生产第一线劳动的同志，可以取长补短，并肩前进；对不在第一线的同志来说，可以彼此共勉，互相支持。
    农村是广阔的天地。可以写、值得写的东西是十分丰富的。我们希望在农业生产第一线上的同志们，在劳动和工作之余，积极热情地支持这个专栏。
