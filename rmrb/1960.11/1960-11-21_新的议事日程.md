    New Agenda
    Strengthening the management and maintenance of agricultural machinery is actually a matter of protecting the productive forces. The fact that Party organizations at all levels in Ningjin County of the CCP have vigorously grasped this work, ensuring that the average utilization rate of agricultural machinery in the county regularly reaches more than 80%, and enabling it to play a huge role in agricultural production, is a very good example.
    With the accelerated pace of agricultural technological transformation, the number of agricultural machines in rural areas is increasing day by day; how to manage, maintain, and use these machines well has been put on the agenda of Party committees at all levels. Ningjin County started by solving the current repair and parts tasks, carried out the work of establishing a network of agricultural machinery repair and parts outlets in an all-round way, implemented a regular inspection system, and combined regular maintenance with concentrated overhauls. These methods are all worth learning from in various places.
    At present, the busy farming season is coming to an end, and many agricultural machines have inevitably suffered some damage after long-term use. In order to meet the needs of next year's production, all localities should seize the opportunity during the slack winter season to thoroughly inspect all agricultural machinery and strengthen maintenance work.

    新的议事日程
    加强农业机械的管理、维修工作，实际上是一个保护生产力的问题。中共宁津县各级党组织狠抓这一工作，保证全县农业机械经常的平均利用率达到80％以上，使之在农业生产中发挥了巨大作用，就是一个很好的例证。
    随着农业技术改造工作的加速进行，农村中的农业机械数量日益增加；如何管理好、维修好、使用好这些机械，已经提到各级党委的议事日程中来了。宁津县从解决当前的修配任务着手，全面进行农业机械修配的建网布点工作，推行了定期检修制度，并使经常维修和突击检修结合起来。这些办法都是值得各地学习的。
    目前，繁忙的农事季节即将过去，许多农业机械经过长期使用，难免有所损坏。为了适应来年生产的需要，各地应该抓紧冬闲时期，把全部农业机械很好的检修一次，并加强养护工作。
