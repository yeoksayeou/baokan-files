Xinhua News Agency, 6th: People from all walks of life in the capital solemnly gathered at Huairentang Hall in Zhongnanhai tonight to celebrate the glorious festival of the worldwide proletariat, working masses, and all oppressed people – the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Commitee and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and other Party and state leaders attended today's meeting.

Tonight, the venue was filled with a festive atmosphere, both inside and outside the hall. Inside the vermillion doors of Huairentang Hall, a red velvet banner displayed a quote from Chairman Mao: "The October Revolution opened up vast possibilities and a realistic path for the liberation cause of the world's people. The October Revolution established a new revolutionary front against world imperialism, extending from the Western proletariat through the Russian Revolution to the oppressed nations of the East." In the center of the rostrum, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union were hung side by side, flanked by huge signs reading "1917-1960". The rostrum was surrounded by evergreen palm trees and blooming flowers.

At 7:30 PM, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and other Party and state leaders, along with Soviet Ambassador to China Chervonenko, the head of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, Stoletov, the deputy head Mitronov, and members of the delegation, the leader of the Soviet Artists Performance Troupe, Gontcharok, and others, walked onto the rostrum to thunderous applause from the entire audience.

Also seated on the rostrum were other Party and state leaders including Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, Tan Zhenlin, Chen Boda, Bo Yibo, Tan Zheng, Xi Zhongxun, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Saifudin, Cheng Qian, and Lin Feng. Also seated on the rostrum were Burhan, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Xie Juezai, Zhang Dingcheng, Zeng Yongquan, Wu Yuzhang, Li Dequan, Shen Yanbing, Shao Lizi, Li Zhuchen, Li Jiebo, Hu Yaobang, Cai Chang, and Zhang Zhixiang, among others.

Wu Yuzhang, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, presided over tonight's celebration. The celebration began with the solemn strains of the Soviet and Chinese national anthems.

Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the celebration (full text on page two). He first extended warm fraternal congratulations to the great Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese government.

Chen Yi pointed out that the October Socialist Revolution was an epoch-making, most great and thorough revolution in human history. He said: "The path of the October Revolution and the 43 years of struggle experience of the Soviet people have proven the most important universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which is: Only by seizing power through revolutionary means, thoroughly destroying the reactionary state machinery, replacing it with the revolutionary state machinery in the hands of the people, establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and constantly strengthening and consolidating this dictatorship, can there be victory in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and can there be complete liberation of the proletariat and working people." Chen Yi denounced the modern revisionists represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique, saying that they comprehensively and systematically castrated the revolutionary soul of Marxism-Leninism, distorted the path of the October Revolution, and opposed proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. He pointed out that although the Tito clique's traitorous face serving imperialism has become increasingly apparent, the conspiratorial activities they are carrying out and the ideological toxins they are spreading should never be ignored. The struggle against modern revisionism must be carried through to the end. At the end of his speech, Chen Yi emphatically spoke about the importance of further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. He said that our unity is the most solid and cannot be destroyed by any force. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people will, under any circumstances, follow the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and cherish the great unity between the Chinese and Soviet people as we cherish our own eyes. Chen Yi said that the Chinese people have received tremendous assistance from the Soviet people in their long revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, and the Chinese people will never forget this. On behalf of the Chinese people, I once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the great Soviet people.

Soviet Ambassador to China Chervonenko was invited to speak at the meeting (full text on page two). He said that the great October Socialist Revolution opened up the period of the collapse of the shameful colonial system. Marxists-Leninists are forever opposed to aggression and imperialist wars of aggression, but they forever stand on the side of the people who are fighting just wars for freedom from colonial enslavement.

Chervonenko also emphasized: "The friendship between the two great socialist powers – the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China – is the most important factor in the continuous consolidation of the world socialist system. There is no, nor can there be any force in the world that can shake this friendship." He emphasized: "The friendship and unity between the Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries is a powerful factor of our time, and it is exerting a decisive influence on the entire course of human development."

Stoletov, head of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, was invited to speak at the meeting. He first extended warm greetings to the fraternal Chinese people. He then further discussed the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people, which has great historical significance. Stoletov said that the friendship between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and China is eternal and unbreakable. The friendship and alliance between our two great countries has tremendous vitality. We should do everything possible to develop and consolidate this force, to the delight of all progressive humanity and to the trembling of the enemies of socialism.

The meeting ended with the singing of the Internationale.

Tonight's celebration was jointly sponsored by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the National Committee of the CPPCC, the Foreign Cultural Affairs Commission, the All-China Federation of

    首都盛会庆祝十月社会主义革命四十三周年
    高高举起十月革命的光辉旗帜
    把人类解放事业推向更大胜利
    据新华社6日讯　首都各界人民今晚在中南海怀仁堂隆重举行集会，庆祝全世界无产阶级、劳动群众和一切被压迫人民的光辉节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年。
    中共中央副主席、国务院总理周恩来，中共中央副主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德等党和国家领导人参加了今天的大会。
    今晚，大会会场内外一片节日景象。怀仁堂朱红色的大门内，一幅红色丝绒上写着毛主席说的一段话：“十月革命给世界人民解放事业开辟了广大的可能性和现实的道路，十月革命建立了一条从西方无产者经过俄国革命到东方被压迫民族的新的反对世界帝国主义的革命战线。”会场主席台正中并排高悬中国和苏联的国旗，两旁挂着“1917—1960”的巨大字标。主席台四周布满了常青棕榈树和盛开的鲜花。
    七时三十分，周恩来、朱德等党和国家领导人，同苏联驻中国大使契尔沃年科，苏中友好协会代表团团长斯托列托夫、副团长米特罗诺夫和代表团团员，苏联艺术家表演团领队冈察洛克等，一起走上主席台，这时全场起立，热烈鼓掌。
    在主席台上入座的还有党和国家的其他领导人陈毅、李富春、谭震林、陈伯达、薄一波、谭政、习仲勋、郭沫若、黄炎培、赛福鼎、程潜、林枫。在主席台上就座的还有包尔汉、张治中、傅作义、谢觉哉、张鼎丞、曾涌泉、吴玉章、李德全、沈雁冰、邵力子、李烛尘、李颉伯、胡耀邦、蔡畅、张致祥等。
    中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章主持今晚的庆祝大会。庆祝大会在高奏庄严的苏联和中国国歌声中开始。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理陈毅在庆祝大会上讲话（全文见第二版）。他首先代表中国人民、中国共产党和中国政府，向伟大的苏联人民、苏联共产党和苏联政府致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    陈毅指出，十月社会主义革命是人类历史上一次划时代的、最伟大和最彻底的革命。他说：“十月革命的道路和苏联人民四十三年的斗争经验，证明了马克思列宁主义最主要的一条普遍真理，这就是：只有用革命手段夺取政权，彻底摧毁反动的国家机器，以掌握在人民手中的革命的国家机器去代替它，建立起无产阶级专政，并且不断地加强和巩固这种专政，才可能有社会主义革命和社会主义建设的胜利，才可能有无产阶级和劳动人民的彻底解放。”陈毅斥责了以南斯拉夫铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者，他说，他们全面地、系统地阉割马克思列宁主义的革命灵魂，歪曲十月革命的道路，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。他指出，尽管铁托集团为帝国主义效劳的叛徒面目已经越来越明显地暴露出来，但是他们所进行的阴谋活动和所散布的思想毒素是决不应该加以忽视的。必须把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。陈毅在讲话的最后，强调地谈到了进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结的重要意义。他说，我们的这种团结是最巩固的，是任何力量都破坏不了的。中国共产党和中国人民，在任何情况下，都将遵循着毛泽东同志的教导，像保护自己的眼睛一样，维护中苏两国人民的伟大团结。陈毅说，中国人民在长期的革命斗争和社会主义建设中，得到了苏联人民的巨大援助，对此，中国人民将永志不忘，我代表中国人民再一次向伟大的苏联人民表示衷心的感谢。
    苏联驻中国大使契尔沃年科应邀在会上讲话（全文见第二版）。他说，伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟了可耻的殖民主义制度崩溃的时期。马克思列宁主义者永远反对侵略，反对帝国主义的侵略战争，但他们永远站在为争取从殖民主义奴役下获得自由而进行正义战争的人民这一边。
    契尔沃年科还强调说：“两个伟大的社会主义强国——苏联和中华人民共和国的友谊，是一个世界社会主义体系不断得到巩固的最重大的因素。世界上没有，也不可能有任何力量能够动摇这种友谊。”他着重指出：“苏联，中国以及所有社会主义国家之间的友谊和团结，是我们时代的一个强有力的因素，它正在对于人类发展的整个进程起着决定性的影响。”
    苏中友好协会代表团团长斯托列托夫应邀在大会上讲话，他首先向兄弟般的中国人民致以热烈的问候。他接着进一步谈到具有伟大历史意义的苏中两国人民之间的友谊，斯托列托夫说，苏中两国伟大人民之间的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。我们两个伟大国家之间的友谊和同盟具有巨大的生命力。我们应当尽一切努力来发展和巩固这种力量，使得全体进步人类高兴，而令社会主义的敌人发抖。
    大会在国际歌声中结束。
    今晚的庆祝大会是由中苏友好协会总会、政协全国委员会、对外文委、全国总工会、共青团中央、全国妇联、全国文联、科学技术协会、北京市中苏友好协会等单位联合主办的。首都劳动人民的代表和首都各方面的人士参加了大会。在北京的苏联朋友和其他各国的来宾，各国驻中国的使节参加了庆祝大会。
    大会结束以后，首都文艺工作者和苏联艺术家表演团的艺术家，表演了中苏两国精采的文艺节目，庆祝这个光辉的节日。（附图片）
