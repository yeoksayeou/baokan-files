Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: New Delhi dispatch: The Indian National Congress's National Committee held a two-day meeting in Raipur, Madhya Pradesh on October 29th and 30th, and discussed and passed two resolutions on the international situation and India's Third Five-Year Plan.

According to reports from the Press Trust of India and the Indian Information Service, Prime Minister Nehru spoke on domestic and foreign issues at the meeting, mentioning the Sino-Indian border issue. He said that India would adhere to its views on the border issue between the two countries. He said that this issue "may still exist" for several years. Nehru also said that while remaining firm on the issue of China, nothing should be done to jeopardize the future.

In this speech, Nehru also condemned Belgium's actions in the Congo, saying that no country should interfere in the Congo's internal affairs and that the Congolese parliament should handle the situation. However, regarding the United States' use of the United Nations to interfere in the Congo, Nehru actually praised the United Nations' intervention as "preventing an outbreak of conflict that could easily trigger a worldwide conflict."

According to a report from the Press Trust of India, Indian Home Minister Pant, at a rally in Shukrana Nagar, Raipur on the evening of the 29th, once again openly slandered China for having a "conspiracy to invade India," saying that India must "remain vigilant on all fronts" and "prepare to eliminate the buds of conspiracies to invade this country (India)."

While the National Committee of the Congress Party was meeting, the Indian People's Socialist Party, at an executive committee meeting held in New Delhi on the 29th, passed a resolution slandering China for "invading" Indian territory; it also openly advocated interference in China's internal affairs, shamelessly cheering for the United Nations General Assembly's illegal discussion of the so-called "Tibet issue."

    尼赫鲁在印度国大党会议上说
    将坚持对中印边界问题的观点
    潘特公然诬蔑我国有“侵略印度的阴谋”
    据新华社1日讯　新德里消息：印度国大党全国委员会于10月29日和30日在中央邦赖普尔举行两天会议，讨论通过了关于国际局势和印度第三个五年计划两个决议。
    据印度报业托辣斯和印度新闻处报道，尼赫鲁总理在会上就国内外问题发言时谈到了中印边界问题。他说，印度将坚持它在两国边界问题上的观点。他说，这个问题“可能还要存在”若干年。尼赫鲁又说，在对中国的问题上坚定不移的同时，不应该做出任何事情来危及未来。
    尼赫鲁在这个发言中还谴责了比利时在刚果的行动，他说，任何国家都不应该干涉刚果内政，应该让刚果议会去处理这一局势。但是，关于美国利用联合国在刚果进行干涉活动的问题，尼赫鲁竟赞扬联合国的干涉活动是“防止了一场很容易触发全世界范围的冲突的爆发”。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度内政部长潘特29日晚上在赖普尔的舒克拉纳加尔的一次集会上，再次公然诬蔑中国有“侵略印度的阴谋”，说什么印度要“在一切战线上保持警惕”，“准备消灭侵略这个国家（印度）的阴谋的萌芽”。
    在国大党全国委员会开会的同时，印度人民社会党29日在新德里举行的执行委员会会议上，通过一项决议诬蔑中国“侵略”印度领土；还公然鼓吹干涉中国内政，无耻地为联合国大会非法讨论所谓“西藏问题”摇旗呐喊。
