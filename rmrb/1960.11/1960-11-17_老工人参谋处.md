Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 15th: The "Old Worker Advisory Office" of the Songhua River Steel Rolling Plant in Jilin City has played a positive role in assisting the plant leaders with offering advice, improving production, and improving management.

    The "Old Worker Advisory Office" was established under the leadership of the plant's Party committee. It currently has nine veteran worker advisors, who have long tenures, are technically skilled, possess rich production experience, maintain close ties with the masses, and are advanced producers and pacesetters from past movements. Each workshop has also formed "Old Worker Advisory Groups" mainly consisting of worker team leaders and some veteran workers. Now, when the factory's leading cadres go deep into the workshops, they are always together with the veteran worker advisors, closely integrating to solve key production issues.

    “老工人参谋处”
    据新华社长春15日电　吉林市松花江轧钢厂的“老工人参谋处”，在帮助厂领导上出谋献策，改进生产及管理方面都起了良好的作用。
    “老工人参谋处”是在厂党委的领导下成立的。现有老工人参谋九名，他们工龄较长，技术熟练，有丰富的生产经验，跟群众有密切联系，都是历次运动中的先进生产者和标兵。各车间也以工人组长和一些老工人为主，组成了“老工人参谋组”。现在，这个工厂的领导干部在深入车间的时候，都同老工人参谋在一起，密切结合，解决生产关键问题。
