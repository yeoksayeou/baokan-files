    The Glorious Image of the Bolsheviks
    ——Introducing the Soviet Film "Midshipman Panin"
    Chen Bo
    To commemorate the 43rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, it is very meaningful to screen the Soviet film "Midshipman Panin" in our country. This film was created by Soviet filmmakers last year after they visited a 74-year-old Bolshevik, Comrade Vasily Ruzhich Banyushkin, and adapted his autobiographical memoirs into a film screenplay.

    This true historical story took place in May 1912 in the Kronstadt naval fortress area near Petrograd. The young naval midshipman Panin, in order to rescue thirteen Bolshevik Party members, bravely andResourcefully hid them on the warship with the other Bolsheviks on the "Ocean" warship, evaded the Czarist secret agents' investigation and search, and sent them to France. At that time, Comrade Lenin was in France, which enabled these comrades to receive instructions from Comrade Lenin and move to new combat posts. The Midshipman Panin in the film also accepted Comrade Lenin's teachings at this time, returned to the "Ocean," cleverly dealt with the enemy's interrogation, and finally went undercover among the sailors, continuing to publicize the Party's policies and expand the Party's organization according to the instructions of the Bolshevik Party, preparing for an armed uprising.

    1912 was an unusual year in Russia at that time. In this year, at the Sixth National Party Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party convened in Prague, the Bolsheviks (majority faction) headed by Comrade Lenin summarized all the past struggles against opportunism and resolved to expel the opportunist Mensheviks (minority faction), who betrayed the interests of the proletariat and attempted to abolish the revolutionary struggle, from the Party, forming an independent Leninist party of the Bolsheviks to lead the Russian socialist revolution. Since then, the Bolshevik Party has launched extensive revolutionary preparations, and such organizational preparations were also carried out in Kronstadt. The film "Midshipman Panin" depicts one aspect of the revolutionary preparatory work. From the heroic, tenacious, and persistent image of struggle of Midshipman Panin, we see the arduous struggle made by the Bolshevik Party in preparation for the armed uprising.

    The reason why this film is vivid and touching is first and foremost that it focuses on depicting Panin's thoughts and wisdom through his struggle to protect the thirteen Bolsheviks, vividly shaping a very moving and glorious image of the Bolsheviks. At the beginning of the film, Midshipman Panin is shown witnessing Navy Vice Admiral Viren publicly insulting the sailor Grigoriev. Because he sympathized with Grigoriev's experience, he stood up bravely and was punished with ten days of confinement. This is a simple description, but it vividly reveals the just, tenacious, and unyielding soul of a young revolutionary at that time, as well as his virtue of connecting with the broad masses. Precisely because of this, when the thirteen Bolsheviks hiding on the "Ocean" warship were discovered by the Czarist secret agent Savichev, Panin immediately threw this bad egg into the sea. Grigoriev, without understanding the situation, went into the sea to save him, but once he discovered that this bad egg was talking about Panin hiding the revolutionaries, he immediately remembered that Panin was righteous and killed the secret agent in the sea. The film's portrayal of Panin is not about depicting Panin's personal legend, but about depicting the mutual support between Panin and many comrades of the Bolshevik Party, and depicting Panin working together with some class-conscious sailors in the collective strength of the Party to complete this arduous struggle: the sailor Kamshkin used a feigned injury to get bandages and medicines from the doctor to treat the injured comrades; Markelov carried out political education work on Grigoriev to improve his political awareness so that he would not leak secrets; they jointly devised a way to disguise these thirteen comrades as sailors and ask for leave to go ashore. Without the Party's collective and the work of these comrades, it would have been difficult for Panin alone to complete such an arduous task. When these thirteen comrades had already escaped and left the warship, the captain received intelligence from the Russian military attache in France, rushed to the dock for inspection, but Panin decisively took responsibility, bravely disregarding the convention of etiquette, and ordered the real and fake sailors lined up on the dock to disperse, allowing the thirteen Bolsheviks to escape safely.

    The second half of the film depicts Panin, following the instructions of Comrade Lenin, returning to the "Ocean" warship in order to continue building and expanding the Bolshevik organization and prepare for the subsequent armed uprising. He was arrested by the captain, and he was originally going to be treated as a political prisoner, but this captain was afraid that the matter would be exposed and would be detrimental to him, so he gave him a way out, deliberately said that he violated military discipline, and gave him a piece of pornographic literature. The clever Panin got inspiration from this, and based on the plot of the story in this novel, fabricated a set of confessions about his luxurious life in Paris. Here, the director first introduced the illustrations in that piece of pornographic literature, so that when Panin made a false confession in court, he used the images on the screen to interweave the characters in the illustrations of the book with the images of Panin's fabricated confession. This allows the audience to fully understand that Panin's confession is fabricated, while the judges and jurors in the play believe it to be true. This is a clever application and creation of film language on the screen. This more vividly depicts Panin's thoughts and wisdom, and shows Panin's loyalty to the arduous task given by Lenin - to carry out a heroic and intelligent struggle for the ideals of communism, for the liberation of the proletariat, and for the preparation of the forces for the armed uprising.

    In the original film screenplay, there is a very important passage spoken by Lenin to Panin in Paris: "...But no matter what, it is still very regrettable that you are not in the fleet. A naval officer is not a joke! A Bolshevik, and a Bolshevik who has received specialized military education! You can imagine that by 1916, 17 or even 18, Russia will definitely erupt into revolution at that time...Do you understand? What can the fleet do if every ship becomes a revolutionary warship! Then, what do you think will happen?..." We learned from the film that on the eve of the proletarian socialist revolution, countless outstanding Bolshevik Party members and revolutionary masses accumulated strength together. This huge force finally broke through the enemy's chains when the storm of the October Revolution came, and established the first socialist country in the world on Russian soil. Isn't it true that on the eve of November 7th, forty-three years ago, the warship "Aurora" anchored on the Neva River in Petrograd fired at the Winter Palace, and the sailors on the Kronstadt fortress revolted. Together with the broad masses of workers and peasants, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, they seized the bourgeois regime and established the first socialist country in the world, opening up the road to liberation for the world's proletariat and the broad oppressed working people. The reality of history is enough to help us explain: we have reason to be full of confidence in the struggle of the "Ocean" in the film. (Attached picture)

    布尔什维克的光辉形象
    ——介绍苏联影片《海军少尉巴宁》
    陈播
    为纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年，在我国放映苏联的影片《海军少尉巴宁》，是一件很有意义的事。这部影片，是苏联电影工作者在去年访问一个七十四岁的老布尔什维克瓦西里·鲁吉奇·巴纽什金同志，并且根据他写的传记性回忆录编写成电影文学剧本而拍摄出来的。
    这个真实的历史故事，是发生在1912年5月彼得格勒附近的喀琅施塔得海军要塞地区。年轻的海军少尉巴宁，为了营救十三位布尔什维克党员脱险，和“海洋”号上其他的布尔什维克们英勇机智地将他们藏在舰船上，摆脱沙皇密探的侦察搜索，并将他们送到法国。那时列宁同志正好在法国，使得这些同志接受到列宁同志的指示，转向新的斗争岗位。影片中的巴宁少尉也就在这个时候，接受了列宁同志的教导，又回到“海洋”号，巧妙地应付了敌人的审讯，终于潜伏到水兵中，继续根据布尔什维克党的指示，宣传党的政策，扩大党的组织，准备武装起义。
    1912年，在当时的俄国，是一个不平常的年月。就在这一年，在俄国社会民主工党在普拉加召集的第六次全国党代表大会上，以列宁同志为首的布尔什维克（多数派）总结了过去反对机会主义的全部斗争，并决议将背叛无产阶级利益，企图取消革命斗争的机会主义者孟什维克（少数派）开除出党，形成了布尔什维克独立存在的列宁主义的政党，领导俄国社会主义革命。从此以后，布尔什维克党展开了广泛的革命准备工作，在喀琅施塔得也进行了这样的组织准备工作。影片《海军少尉巴宁》正是描写革命准备工作的一个侧面。我们从巴宁少尉英勇顽强、坚持斗争的形象，看到布尔什维克党为了准备武装起义所作的艰苦斗争。
    这部影片之所以生动感人，首先是在于它着重通过巴宁少尉掩护十三位布尔什维克脱险的斗争，来展开对巴宁少尉的思想和智慧的刻划，生动地塑造了一个十分感人的布尔什维克的光辉形象。影片一开头就表现巴宁少尉看见海军中将维连当众侮辱水兵格里高利耶夫，由于他同情格里高利耶夫的遭遇，路见不平，挺身而出，因而受到关禁闭十天的处分。这是一小段朴素的描写，却生动地揭示了当时一个青年革命者的正义和顽强不屈的心灵，和联系广大群众的品德。也正因为如此，所以当躲藏在“海洋”号军舰上的十三个布尔什维克被沙皇密探萨维切夫发现后，巴宁立即将这个坏蛋打入海中。格里高利耶夫在不了解情况下，下海去救人，一旦发现这个坏蛋讲述巴宁隐藏革命者的事，他马上想起巴宁是正义的，就在海里将这个密探处死。影片刻划巴宁，不是描写巴宁个人的传奇，而是描写巴宁和布尔什维克党许多同志的互相支援，描写巴宁在党的集体力量中和一些有了阶级觉悟的水兵们一起共同来完成这一艰险的斗争：水兵卡姆什金用苦肉计的办法从医生那里弄来绷带和药品，来医治受伤的同志；马尔凯洛夫给格里高利耶夫进行政治教育工作，提高他的政治觉悟，使他不致泄密；他们共同设法使这十三个同志化装成水兵请假上岸。假如没有党的集体，没有这些同志的工作，巴宁一个人是难以完成这样艰巨的任务的。当这十三个同志已经脱险离开了舰船，舰长接到俄国驻法国的武官送来情报，赶上码头检查，而巴宁却当机立断，勇敢地承担责任，不顾礼节的惯例，命令码头上列队的真假水兵们解散，使十三位布尔什维克安全脱险。
    影片的下半部，是描写巴宁奉列宁同志的指示，又回到“海洋”号军舰上，以便继续建立和扩大布尔什维克的组织，准备后来的武装起义。他被舰长逮捕起来了，本来要按政治犯处理的，可是这个舰长怕这件事被揭露后于己不利，就给他开脱一条路，故意说他是违犯军纪，并且送给他一本黄色书刊。聪明的巴宁从这里得到启发，根据这本小说的故事情节，编造一套在巴黎所过的豪华生活的口供。在这里导演首先对那本黄色书刊中的插画作了介绍，使巴宁在法庭上供出假口供时，运用银幕上的形象将书中插画上的人物，和巴宁所编造口供的形象交织在一起。这样就让观众完全明白巴宁的口供是编造的，而剧中的审判官和陪审的人却信以为真。这是银幕上电影语言巧妙的运用和创造。这就更生动地刻划了巴宁的思想和智慧，表现了巴宁忠于列宁所给的艰巨任务——为了共产主义的理想，为了无产阶级解放，为准备武装起义的力量而进行英勇机智的斗争。
    在影片原文学剧本中，有列宁在巴黎时对巴宁说的一段很重要的话：“……但不管怎么样，你不在舰队里了，这还是非常可惜的。海军军官，这不是闹着玩的！一个布尔什维克，而且是受过专门军事教育的布尔什维克！你可以想像一下，到了1916年，17年或者说是18年吧，到那个时候俄国一定会爆发革命……你明白吗？舰队可以有什么样的作为，要是每一艘都成了革命的军舰！那么，你看会怎么样？……”。我们从影片中体会到在无产阶级社会主义革命的前夜里，无数的优秀的布尔什维克党党员和革命群众在一起积蓄了力量。这一巨大力量终于在十月革命的暴风雨来临时冲破了敌人的锁链，在俄国国土上建立起世界上第一个社会主义国家。可不是吗，四十三年前的十一月七日前夕，停在彼得堡?瓦河上的“阿芙乐尔”号军舰，向冬宫开炮了，喀琅施塔得要塞上的水兵起义了，他们和广大的工人农民在一起，在布尔什维克党的领导下，夺取了资产阶级政权，建立起世界上第一个社会主义国家，为全世界无产阶级和广大被压迫的劳动人民，开辟了解放的道路。历史的真实已足以帮助我们说明：我们对影片中“海洋”号以后的斗争充满信心是有根据的。（附图片）
