Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 22nd: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on November 22nd: U.S. Embassy in Moscow Assistant Air Attaché Major MacDonald has been expelled from the Soviet Union by the Soviet government for engaging in espionage activities incompatible with his status as a diplomatic staff member.

The communiqué issued by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs had requested MacDonald on November 21st to leave Soviet territory within forty-eight hours. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a protest with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow regarding this matter and once again reminded it that such activities are impermissible.

The communiqué pointed out that during his stay in the Soviet Union, MacDonald conducted a large number of espionage trips within the Soviet Union and attempted more than once to probe the distribution of Soviet military targets and military industrial targets.

Relevant authorities have ascertained that MacDonald actively participated in the intelligence activities of the U.S. Embassy's Air Attaché staff after arriving in the Soviet Union. He was once caught red-handed photographing military targets in the city of Kurgan during a trip. Espionage materials related to defense targets on the Moscow-Kurgan line were found on his person.

The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued a warning to MacDonald, but, as the communiqué pointed out, after this, the American Assistant Air Attaché continued to carry out a series of activities throughout the Soviet Union to collect espionage intelligence. On October 18th, MacDonald was detained by a military patrol in a garrison and defense factory area near Kharkov.

    美驻苏使馆助理空军武官刺探
    苏联军情苏联抗议美国
    间谍活动间谍麦克唐纳已被驱逐出境
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科22日讯：美国驻莫斯科大使馆助理空军武官麦克唐纳少校因从事同外交工作人员的身份不相容的间谍活动，被苏联政府驱逐出境。
    苏联外交部发表的公报说，苏联外交部已在11月21日要求麦克唐纳在四十八小时之内离开苏联国境。外交部已就此事向美国驻莫斯科大使馆提出抗议，并再一次提醒它注意：这种活动是不能容许的。
    公报指出，麦克唐纳在苏联逗留期间，在苏联国内作了大量的间谍旅行，不只一次地企图刺探苏联的军事目标和军事工业目标的分布情况。
    据有关机关查明，麦克唐纳在来到苏联之后，就积极参加美国大使馆空军武官人员的情报活动。他曾经由于在旅途中拍摄库尔干市的军事目标而被当场捕获。从他身上搜出了有关莫斯科——库尔干一线上的国防目标的间谍材料。
    苏联外交部曾向麦克唐纳提出过警告，但是，公报指出，在这以后，这个美国助理空军武官继续为搜集间谍情报在苏联各地进行了一系列的活动。10月18日，麦克唐纳在哈尔科夫附近的驻军和国防工厂地区被军事巡逻队扣留。
