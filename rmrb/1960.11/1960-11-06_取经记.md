    A Record of Seeking Expertise
    Liu Duyi

    One day in early September, a team of forty people, carrying luggage, marched into the 0.5-ton Red Flag converter workshop of the Qingdao Bicycle Factory. This was a "seeking expertise" team from the steelmaking workshop of the Qingdao State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill. They included a complete set of steelmaking personnel, from cadres to workers of various trades and processes, led by Deputy Party Secretary Li Zizhen, determined to have soldiers learn from soldiers, generals learn from generals, and counterparts learn from counterparts to comprehensively study the experience of the Red Flag furnace. They would not give up until they had learned it well.
    As soon as they arrived at the workshop, they went to find workers of the same trade to recognize as masters and learn skills.
    Furnace operator Wang Junsheng ran to the furnace and apprenticed to Song Jiashan, the Red Flag furnace operator. At first, he stood by and watched his master operate skillfully and intently, unable to see any difference from his own operation, but every furnace produced high-quality steel, while most of his own furnaces produced secondary or substandard steel. He then carefully observed his master's operating movements. After half a day, he still didn't find any special characteristics, and an idea came to his mind: "Maybe the 0.5-ton furnace is just easier to operate than our 1-ton furnace. If I operated this furnace, the quality wouldn't be much worse." Thinking of this, he was eager to try. The master seemed to have seen through his mind and asked him to operate it himself. He stood confidently in the operating room. As soon as the molten iron ladle left the furnace mouth, he opened the slow wind, holding the gate and slowly raising the converter, adjusting the angle, then opened the fast wind, the converter roared, spraying golden and dazzling steel flowers.
    It had been blowing for twelve minutes. According to the master's blowing time, it was time to tap the steel, but looking at the flame spewing from the converter, it was still not possible to tap the steel. He became a little anxious, and sweat appeared on his forehead. The steel temperature could not be reached, so he had to adopt the method of post-blowing, extending the blowing time by three minutes before tapping the steel. When the test sample slip with "secondary steel" written on it appeared before his eyes, his mind buzzed, and he felt as if he had swallowed a ball of fire. He had to bite the bullet and ask his master for advice. Master Song told him that this was because the blowing angle was wrong, and he had not mastered face blowing. Then Master Song held his hand and taught him to blow the second and third furnaces, teaching him again and again how to master the correct blowing angle, master face blowing, and prevent deep blowing and post-blowing. He followed the method taught by the master and blew four more furnaces, all of which were high-quality steel. Only then was he convinced.
    Furnace repairman Jiang Jintong came to the magnesia mixing room to learn their experience in mixing furnace repair magnesia. He was about to lift his leg and step into the door when he was hurriedly stopped by a female worker: "Comrade, don't come in yet." He was stunned for a moment and asked puzzledly: "What, is it not allowed to visit and study here?" "It's not that you're not allowed to visit, but because there is mud on your feet, and if it falls into the magnesia, the life of the repaired furnace will be short. Please wipe your feet before you come in!" Hearing these words, Jiang Jintong's mind immediately churned: "People are working so conscientiously and meticulously, and we have never paid such attention to cleanliness when mixing magnesia." This lesson learned before even entering the door made him feel from the bottom of his heart that the experience on the Red Flag furnace was everywhere, and every bit was worth learning well.
    A day passed, and the forty people returned to the dormitory with different feelings. Talking about the first day of learning, everyone had a common feeling: the experience of the Red Flag furnace was abundant, and it was necessary to learn comprehensively and carefully. Not only should they learn advanced operating techniques, but more importantly, they should learn their sense of ownership and communist style.
    A few days later. Just as the sky was beginning to lighten, furnace repair team leader Dong Taide came running, panting, to find technician Wang Congyue, and said to him: "Old Wang, go and have a look, the converter that was repaired yesterday was broken overnight!" Wang Congyue was startled when he heard this, and followed him to the workshop.
    The low converter lining life was an important key to the poor production of this workshop. The day before yesterday, after they returned from learning the experience of the Red Flag furnace, they repaired a furnace overnight according to the Red Flag furnace repair method. The effect was good when they blew three furnaces for testing last night, but they were not sure how many furnaces it could blow in the end. Therefore, at four o'clock in the morning, Dong Taide came to the workshop to check the blowing situation of the converter. Upon inspection of the furnace lining, he was shocked. After only twenty-seven furnaces had been blown, the thirty-centimeter-thick furnace lining around the tuyere had eroded to only three centimeters. If it hadn't been checked early, there would have been a danger of melting through the furnace body. After he found Wang Congyue, the two of them immediately checked and analyzed with the furnace repairmen and furnace operators: the other parts of the furnace lining were very good, only the tuyere eroded greatly. Was it a problem with the furnace repair, or a problem with the operation? If it was a problem with the furnace repair, why did the tuyere erode so much? They analyzed for more than an hour, but still could not find the cause. Finally, everyone decided to seek advice from the Red Flag furnace again.
    Wang Congyue ran to the Bicycle Factory in one breath and found Master Li Shiyou, explaining the situation of the furnace to him. Li Shiyou told him that the magnesia used to pack the tuyere might not be good. The magnesia for packing the tuyere should preferably be coffee-colored, and post-blowing should be strictly prohibited, and so on. Wang Congyue also found material administrator Zhang Zirong. Zhang Zirong told him that the proportion of ingredients might not be strictly controlled, and materials should be strictly managed. After the masters pointed this out, his mind became much clearer. After returning, he improved according to the masters' opinions, but the furnace lining life was still not high. They did not lose confidence. They thought: "The method works well for others, but it doesn't work well for us. This is because we haven't learned well. If it doesn't work, we'll go and learn again. We must learn it well!" So Wang Congyue went to find Li Shiyou again: "Master Li, the furnace lining life is still not high. The tuyere is still eroding greatly."
    "How coarse is the material you use to pack the tuyere?"
    "The same coarseness as other places."
    "How about adding brine?"
      "Didn't weigh it."
    As soon as the master heard this, he found the problem and pointed out: "The scouring force at the tuyere is high, so use more coarse magnesia that is resistant to scouring when packing the tuyere. Add less brine to the magnesia for packing the tuyere, so that it is drier and more solid when packed." Li Shiyou also said, "You are using a one-ton furnace, which is different from our half-ton furnace. You also need to think of some improvement methods according to the characteristics of the one-ton furnace." Wang Congyue listened to these words as if he had obtained a treasure, and hurried back to study with the furnace repairmen. When they repaired the furnace and tested it, the furnace lining life was improved again. In this way, each time they learned, they improved once. After going to the Red Flag furnace workshop sixteen times, they finally obtained the "true expertise", broke through the converter lining life barrier, and increased the life of a furnace from blowing twenty-four furnaces to sixty-four furnaces.

    取经记
    刘笃义
    9月上旬的一天，一支四十人的队伍，背着行李浩浩荡荡来到了青岛自行车厂零点五吨红旗转炉车间。这是青岛国棉一厂炼钢车间的“取经”队。他们包括了从干部到各工种各工序工人的一整套炼钢人员，在党委副书记李子真带领下，决心兵学兵、将学将、对手对口地全面学习红旗炉的经验。不学好，不罢休。
    他们一到车间，就分头找同工种的工人认师学艺。
    摇炉工王俊升跑到炉前，拜红旗炉摇炉工宋家善为师。开始他站在旁边看着师傅熟练、紧张地操作着，一时看不出与自己的操作有什么不同，但炉炉都吹出了优质钢，而自己吹炼的多数是二级钢或级外钢。他又仔细地观察起师傅的操作动作来。半天，仍未发现什么特点，于是一个想法涌上心头：“可能是零点五吨的炉子就是比我们一吨的炉子好操作，叫我操作这个炉子，质量也差不了。”想到这里，他就有点跃跃欲试了。师傅好像已经看透了他的心，就叫他亲自操作。他胸有成竹地站在操作室内，铁水包刚刚离开炉口，就开了慢风，把着闸让转炉徐徐地抬起头来，调好了角度，接着又开了快风，转炉呜呜地吼叫着，喷射着金黄色耀眼的钢花。
    已经吹炼十二分钟了，按师傅吹炼的时间，这正是应该出钢的时候，但是，看转炉喷出的火焰，却还不能出钢。他有点发急了，额上冒出了汗珠。钢水温度达不到，只好采取后吹的办法，延长了三分钟的吹炼时间才出钢。当写着“二级钢”的化验钢样的单子出现在他的眼前时，他脑子嗡的一声，觉得就像肚里吞下了一团火似地难受。他只好硬着头皮向师傅请教。宋师傅告诉他，这是吹炼的角度不对，没有掌握面吹。接着宋师傅又把着手教他吹炼了第二炉、第三炉，并一遍一遍地教他如何掌握正确的吹炼角度、掌握面吹和防止深吹、后吹的方法。他按照师傅教的方法又吹炼了四炉，炉炉都是优质钢。他这才佩服了。
    修炉工姜进同来到了镁砂搅拌室，要学习他们拌修炉镁砂的经验。他刚要抬起腿向门内跨步，就被一位女工急急地喊住了：“同志，你先别进。”他楞了一下，不解地问道：“怎么，这里不让参观学习吗？”“不是不让参观，因为你脚上有泥，落到镁砂里，修的炉子寿命短，你擦擦脚进来吧！” 听了这一席话，姜进同的脑子立刻翻腾起来：“人家是这么认真负责，一丝不苟地工作，而我们拌镁砂从来没有这样注意过清洁。”没进门就上的这一课，使他从心眼里感到红旗炉上的经验到处都有，一点一滴都值得好好学习。
    一天的时间过去了，四十个人怀着不同的感受回到宿舍里，交谈起第一天学习的感想来，大家一个共同的感觉是：红旗炉的经验很多，必须全面学、仔细学，不但要学习人家先进的操作技术，更重要的还是要学习他们主人翁的劳动态度和共产主义的风格。
    过了几天。天刚麻麻亮，修炉班长董太德跑得忽嗤忽嗤地来找技术员王从月，对他说：“老王，快去看看吧，昨天修好的转炉，一夜就吹坏了！” 王从月一听吓了一跳，跟着他就向车间跑去。
    转炉炉龄不高，是这个车间生产不好的重要关键。前天，他们学习红旗炉的经验回来后，就连夜按照红旗炉修炉的方法修了一个炉子，昨晚吹炼三炉试验时，效果还不错，但到底能吹炼多少炉？心中却没有底。因此，早上四点多钟董太德就来到车间察看转炉吹炼的情况。一检查炉衬，他大吃一惊。仅仅吹炼了二十七炉，风眼周围三十厘米厚的炉衬就化得只剩了三厘米，如果不是检查得早，就有化穿炉体的危险。他找到王从月后，二人立即和修炉工、摇炉工一起检查分析起来：炉衬其他部分都很好，就只风眼周围浸蚀大，是修炉不好呢，还是操作上的问题？如果是修炉的毛病，为什么单单风眼浸蚀大呢？他们分析了一个多小时，仍然找不出原因来。最后大家决定再到红旗炉去求师。
    王从月一口气跑到自行车厂，找到了师傅李士友，向他说明了炉子的情况。李士友告诉他，可能打风眼的镁砂不好。打风眼的镁砂最好是用咖啡色的，另外还要严禁后吹，等等。王从月又找到材料管理员张子荣。张子荣告诉他，可能配料比例掌握的不严，要严格管理材料。经师傅们这么一指点，心里亮堂多了，回来后就照师傅的意见进行了改进，但是炉龄仍然不高。他们没有失去信心。他们想：人家用这办法好，我们用着不好，这是我们没学好，不行就再去学，一定要学好！于是王从月又去找到了李士友：“李师傅，炉龄仍然不高。还是风眼浸蚀大。”
    “你们打风眼用的料多粗？”
    “和其他地方一样粗。”
    “加卤水呢？”
      “没称。”
    师傅一听就发现了毛病，指出：“风眼处冲刷力大，打风眼要多用一些抗冲刷的粗镁砂，打风眼的镁砂要少加卤水，让它干一些，打起来才结实。”李士友还说，“你们是一吨的炉子，不比我们这半吨的，还要根据一吨炉子的特点想些改进的办法。”王从月听了这些话，如获至宝，连忙回去和修炉工一起研究。修起了炉子，一试验，炉龄又有提高。就这样，学一次提高一次，先后去红旗炉车间学了十六次，终于取得了“真经”，突破了转炉炉龄关，使一个炉子由吹炼二十四炉，提高到六十四炉。
