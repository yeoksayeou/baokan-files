(Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 28th) The Wuyou People's Commune in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, due to its adherence to unified leadership, decentralized management, and a three-level ownership system based on production teams, has seen annual increases in the economic income of the commune, brigades (i.e., production teams, the basic accounting units, the same below), and production groups, and annual increases in the income of commune members.

    Brigades and Teams Jointly Plan Major Production Tasks

In implementing the policy of a three-level ownership system based on teams, Wuyou Commune first paid attention to strengthening the production management of production brigades. The commune did not make rigid unified regulations on crop arrangements, output targets, farmland capital construction, and technical measures. Instead, it mobilized cadres and commune members from the bottom up to discuss these matters, and made suggestions to production brigades based on the national plan. The production groups and production brigades jointly discussed and formulated production plans. For example, in terms of increasing production measures, each brigade, based on its specific local conditions and actual needs, grasped the key to increasing production. Some focused on building small-scale water conservancy projects, some focused on improving soil, and some focused on carrying out basic fertilizer construction on a large scale. Gougang Brigade is a well-known saline-alkali滩子. Based on the characteristics of saline-alkali land and the different degrees of salinity, the brigade, after discussions with commune members, adopted various measures according to local conditions to convert most of the saline-alkali land into fertile land. Areas that could not grow anything in the past now grow very good rice, cotton, and corn. The total grain output increased by 22% compared to last year, and the total cotton output increased by more than 30% compared to last year. 98% of commune members increased their income. The commune also did not make mechanical regulations on crop layout. The tenth production team of Xinhe Brigade had uneven terrain. After mobilizing the masses for discussion, and jointly discussing with the brigade, they reasonably arranged crop varieties according to the terrain, while ensuring the completion of national plans and contracted output targets, and set out measures according to the fields. Due to the reasonable layout and correct measures, both grain and cotton production in this team increased compared to last year.

    Every Team Engages in Diversified Operations

Based on the principle of team-based three-level ownership, in addition to doing a good job in agriculture, Wuyou Commune also actively helped brigades develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. Under the leadership and support of the commune, each brigade, based on its specific conditions such as labor force, resources, technical equipment, and funds, established an appropriate number of pig farms, fish farms, and farm tool repair and fitting groups and grain and feed processing plants directly serving agricultural production, based on the principles of self-reliance and using local materials, which strongly supported the agricultural and sideline production of the brigade.

Each production group, under the premise of ensuring the completion of contracted output tasks, also developed diversified operations according to local conditions. By the end of October this year, the income from diversified operations of each production group reached more than 270,000 yuan, which greatly enlivened the economy of the team and increased the income of commune members. The sideline production of commune member families has also been appropriately developed, and basically every household in the commune of six thousand households raises a pig.

The development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery has also increased strong funds, fertilizers, and materials for agricultural production, supporting agricultural production. This year, the whole commune raised more than 600,000 dan of fertilizer through pig raising, and more than 20 dan of fertilizer were applied per mu on average to 30,000 mu of farmland.

    Self-Reliance in Developing Collective Economy

Of the 1,036 laborers invested in the collective economic units of Wuyou Commune, except for the vegetable direct team, they were mainly solved by combining the transformation of the old town and absorbing the original citizens of the town. In all commune-run enterprise units, only 81 laborers were transferred from rural areas, accounting for 0.65% of the total rural labor force. The commune, based on the spirit of hard work and thrift, used the methods of "group," "order," "unify," and "save" to solve the required funds. "Group" means organizing idle funds; "order" means organizing production units to sign purchase and sales contracts with purchasing units and prepaying deposits; "unify" means that according to the different peaks and valleys of production, the commune uniformly plans the funds of each enterprise unit and implements mutual cooperation to supplement the valleys with the peaks; "save" means careful calculation in everything and starting from thrifty methods. After adopting the above methods, no loans were taken from the state, nor was a penny transferred from the brigades, and the difficulty of lacking funds was relatively smoothly resolved.

    Strongly Support Team-Owned Economy

The development of the collective economy has strongly supported the development of the team-owned economy. In the past two years, the commune's agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair plant has manufactured more than 385,000 pieces of various large, medium, and small agricultural tools; at the same time, it has taken out more than 50,000 yuan from the accumulation of the collective economy to purchase five water pumps and six threshing machines for the brigades; it has also supplied the brigades with a large amount of chemical fertilizer and other production materials, greatly supporting the agricultural production of the brigades.

The development of the collective economy has also played a great role in helping poor teams to turn over. The commune originally had four relatively poor teams. The commune took out more than 40,000 yuan from the accumulation of the collective economy, as well as more than 1,000 pieces of pig manure, chemical fertilizer, and agricultural tools, to support the poor teams in developing production. With the support of the commune, the grain and cotton yields per mu of the four poor teams have increased compared to last year, basically changing the face of poverty.

    伍佑公社坚持以生产队为基础的三级所有制
    公社三级经济全面发展
    自力更生发展社有经济，社办企业只从农村抽调八十一人
    本报南京28日电　江苏盐城县伍佑人民公社由于坚持统一领导，分级管理，队为基础的三级所有制，公社、大队（即生产队，基本核算单位，下同）和生产小队的经济收入年年增长，社员的收入年年增加。
    社队共商生产大计
    伍佑公社在执行以队为基础的三级所有制的政策中，首先注意加强生产大队的生产管理。对于作物安排、产量指标、农田基本建设和技术措施等，公社都不作硬性的统一规定，而是自下而上地发动干部、社员讨论，根据国家计划向生产大队提出建议，由生产小队和生产大队共同商量制订生产计划。例如在增产措施上，各大队都根据本队当时当地的具体条件和实际需要，抓住增产关键，有的以兴修小型水利为主，有的以改良土壤为主，有的以大搞肥料基本建设为主。枸港大队是一个出名的盐碱滩子，大队根据盐碱地的特点和盐分的不同程度，经社员讨论，因地制宜地采取各种办法，把绝大部分盐碱地改成良田，往年寸草不生的，今年都长上很好的水稻、棉花、玉米，粮食总产量比去年增长22％，棉花总产量比去年增长30％以上，98％的社员增加了收入。在作物布局上，公社也不作机械规定。新河大队第十生产小队地势高低不一，经过发动群众讨论，又和大队共同商量，在保证完成国家计划和包产指标的前提下，根据地势合理安排作物品种，并按田订出措施。由于布局合理，措施对头，今年这个小队粮食、棉花都比去年增产。
    队队都搞多种经营
    根据队为基础三级所有的原则，伍佑公社除搞好农业以外，还积极帮助大队发展林牧副渔生产。各个大队在公社的领导和支持下，根据本队的劳力、资源、技术设备和资金等具体情况，本着自力更生、就地取材的原则，办起了适当数量的养猪场、养鱼场和直接为农业生产服务的农具修配组、粮食饲料加工厂，有力地支持了本队的农副业生产。
    各生产小队在保证完成包产任务的前提下，也因时因地制宜地发展多种经营。到今年10月底止，各生产小队进行多种经营的收入共达二十七万多元，大大活跃了小队的经济和增加了社员的收入。社员家庭的副业生产也得到了适当的发展，全社六千户，基本上达到户户养一头猪。
    林牧副渔的发展，又为农业生产增加了雄厚的资金、肥料和物资，支援了农业生产。今年全社养猪积肥六十多万担，三万亩农田平均每亩多施肥二十担。
    自力更生发展社有经济
    伍佑公社社有经济单位中投放的一千零三十六个劳动力，除蔬菜直属队外，主要是结合改造旧市镇、吸收原来市镇上的市民解决的。全部社办企业单位中，从农村抽调的劳动力只有八十一人，占农村劳动力总数的0.65％。公社本着苦干穷办的精神，运用“组”“订”“统”“省”的办法，解决了所需的资金。“组”即组织闲散资金；“订”即组织生产单位向购货单位签订购销合同，预付定金；“统”即根据生产淡旺的不同，由公社统一筹划各企业单位的资金，实行相互协作，以淡补旺；“省”即事事精打细算，一切从穷办法着眼。采取上述办法以后，没有向国家贷款，也没有从大队抽调分文，缺少资金的困难也比较顺利地解决了。
    大力支持队有经济
    社有经济的发展，有力地扶植了队有经济的发展。两年来，公社农机制造修配厂共制造了各种大中小农具三十八万五千多件；同时，从社有经济的积累中拿出五万多元给大队购买了五台抽水机、六台脱粒机；还供应大队大量化肥和其它生产资料，大大支持了大队的农业生产。
    社有经济的发展，对帮助穷队翻身也起了很大的作用。全社原有四个比较穷的队，公社从社有经济积累中拿出四万多元，以及猪肥、化肥、农具一千多件，支持穷队发展生产。在公社支持下，今年四个穷队的粮食、棉花单产都比去年增产，基本上改变了贫困面貌。
