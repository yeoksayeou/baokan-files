Xinhua News Agency report: The nationwide campaign among employees of grain and oil processing enterprises to increase production and conserve resources, centered on improving the yield rate of grain and oil, has achieved significant results. According to preliminary statistics from twenty provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, during the third quarter of this year, grain processing enterprises in these regions increased production of processed grain by more than 58 million jin for the state, while ensuring quality, due to improved yield rates. In fourteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, including Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, and Guizhou, the average flour yield per hundred jin of wheat increased by more than half a jin in the third quarter of this year compared to last year. The oil yield of various oilseeds has also increased to varying degrees. In the third quarter alone, Zhejiang, Anhui, Liaoning, Shanghai, Shanxi, Fujian, and Beijing increased oil production by 1.5 million jin due to improved oil yield.

The campaign to increase production and conserve resources among employees of grain and oil processing enterprises in various regions was launched under the situation of the whole Party and the whole people vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the vast number of employees in the grain and oil processing industry have generally studied the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation. They have realized that minimizing losses in the grain and oil processing process and conscientiously improving yield rates, using the same amount of raw materials to process more flour, rice, coarse grains, and oil, is their glorious task. Therefore, many enterprise employees are in high spirits and full of energy, acting in the spirit of "not letting a single grain be lost, every qian and liang must be fought for," vigorously carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution, launching a vigorous benchmark competition, opponent competition, and technical performance competition, and doing everything possible to increase grain and oil production. The employees of the Anyang Flour Mill in Henan Province, a famous red flag unit in the grain processing industry, improved old equipment and added new flour sieves, increasing the screening area by 42%. At the same time, they adjusted the power load, correspondingly adjusted the flour path, and improved the process, greatly increasing the flour yield rate and ensuring good quality. In Guanxian County, Sichuan Province, which is rich in rapeseed, employees of various oil mills launched a competition of "everyone striving for high yields, every pressing setting a record," and universally carried out technical transformation of all 199 local oil presses in the county. Focusing on the four main links of whole seeds, grinding, steaming blanks, and pressing in oil extraction, they vigorously promoted advanced oil extraction methods of "fine grinding, loose grinding, and high moisture steaming blanks," increasing the average oil yield per hundred jin of rapeseed by more than nine jin compared to last year. Employees of grain and oil processing enterprises in Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, put forward the heroic slogan of "rather shed a thousand drops of sweat than lose a drop of oil," setting off a competition upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and helping the backward. The oil yield of various oilseeds has generally increased by more than half a jin compared to last year, and a total of more than 70,000 jin of oil has been increased for the state from January to September.

During the campaign to increase production and conserve resources, leading cadres at all levels of the grain and oil processing departments generally went deep into the front line of production. Leading cadres of the Xinlan Flour Mill in Lanzhou, in going deep into the front line, first discovered and solved the problem of slow transportation of raw grain, and then solved the contradiction between the rapid entry of raw grain into the machine and the flour milling machine not being able to keep up with production needs. After the speed of the flour milling machine was increased, the flat sieve and round sieve equipment in the next process had to be adjusted accordingly. With the spirit of continuous revolution, they closely relied on the masses, and finally solved all the above problems one after another, not only increasing the flour yield rate, but also doubling the daily processing capacity of flour in the entire factory. After leading cadres of the Harbin Grain Bureau went to the grain processing factory in the eighth district, they discussed with the workers and adjusted the screening area and wind power, increasing the daily output of rice from 20 tons to 60 tons.

Grain and oil processing enterprises in many regions have also simultaneously carried out the comprehensive utilization of grain and oil by-products, producing more non-staple foods, feed, and chemical raw materials for the country. In the third quarter, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan and other places comprehensively utilized grain and oil processing by-products, producing a total of more than 134,000 tons of various feeds, maltose, wine, starch, soy sauce, vinegar, monosodium glutamate, etc. The Harbin grain and oil processing industry department has comprehensively utilized the by-products of bran, husk, navel, and skin without discarding any of them. At present, it can produce 34 kinds of products, basically achieving comprehensive utilization in every factory, and comprehensive utilization of every by-product.

### 少用原粮多出米面  少用油料多出油脂

    少用原粮多出米面  少用油料多出油脂
    二十个省市粮食加工业增产成品粮五千八百万斤，七个省市增产油脂一百五十万斤
    新华社讯　全国各地粮油加工企业职工开展的以提高粮油出品率为中心的增产节约运动，已经取得很大成绩。据二十个省、市、自治区的初步统计，今年第三季度，这些地区的粮食加工企业在保证质量的前提下，由于出品率提高，共为国家增产了成品粮五千八百多万斤。北京，河北，山西，内蒙古，吉林，辽宁，黑龙江，浙江，福建，河南，湖北，陕西，新疆和贵州等十四个省、市、自治区，今年第三季度每百斤小麦的平均出粉率都比去年提高半斤以上。各种油料的出油率也有程度不同的提高，仅浙江、安徽、辽宁、上海、山西、福建和北京等七个省市，第三季度由于提高出油率就增产了油脂一百五十万斤。
    各地粮油加工企业职工的增产节约运动，是在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的形势下开展起来的。在各级党委的领导下，粮油加工工业的广大职工对于以农业为基础的这一方针普遍进行了学习，他们认识到在粮油加工过程中尽量减少损耗，认真提高出品率，用同样多的原料加工出更多的面粉、大米、杂粮和油脂，是自己的一项光荣任务。因此，许多企业的职工意气风发，干劲冲天，本着“颗粒不漏，钱两必争”的精神，大闹技术革新和技术革命，展开了轰轰烈烈的标兵赛、对手赛、技术表演赛，千方百计增产粮油。粮食加工工业著名红旗单位——河南省安阳面粉厂的职工改进了旧设备，添置了新面筛，使筛理面积扩大42％，同时又调整动力负荷，相应调整粉路，改进工艺过程，大大提高了出粉率，并且保证了良好的质量。盛产油菜的四川省灌县，各油厂职工展开“人人夺高产，榨榨创纪录”的竞赛，对全县一百九十九台土榨普遍进行了技术改造。他们针对榨油中的整籽、磨料、蒸坯、打榨四个主要环节，大力推广“磨细、磨松、高水分蒸坯”的先进榨油方法，使每百斤菜籽的平均出油率比去年提高九斤多。江苏省溧阳县粮油加工企业的职工提出“宁流千滴汗，不漏一滴油”的豪迈口号，掀起了学先进、比先进、赶先进、帮后进的竞赛热潮，各种油料的出油率一般都比去年提高半斤以上，一月至九月份共为国家增产油脂七万多斤。
    在增产节约运动中，粮油加工部门的各级领导干部普遍深入生产第一线。兰州市新兰面粉厂领导干部在深入第一线中，首先发现和解决了原粮运输迟缓的问题，接着解决了原粮入机快、磨粉机赶不上生产需要的矛盾：磨粉机加快转速后，下道工序的平筛和圆箩设备又要作相应的调整。他们以不断革命精神，紧密依靠群众，终于把上面的问题一环扣一环地全部解决，不但出粉率提高，而且使全厂面粉日加工能力增加一倍。哈尔滨市粮食局的领导干部深入到八区粮食加工厂以后，跟工人共同商量，调整了筛理面积和风力等问题，使大米日产量由二十吨提高到六十吨。
    不少地区的粮油加工企业还同时开展了粮油副产品的综合利用工作，为国家生产出了更多的副食品、饲料和化工原料。内蒙古、辽宁、江苏、浙江、湖南等地第三季度综合利用粮油加工副产品，共生产出各种饲料、饴糖、酒、淀粉、酱油、醋、味精等十三万四千多吨。哈尔滨市粮油加工工业部门对副产品糠、壳、脐、皮一点不丢地进行了综合利用，目前已能生产三十四种产品，基本上做到了厂厂搞综合利用，样样副产品都能综合利用。
