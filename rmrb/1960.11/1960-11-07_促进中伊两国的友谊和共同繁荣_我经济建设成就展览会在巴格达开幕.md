Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 5th: The Exhibition of Achievements in Economic Construction of the People's Republic of China opened here tonight. This is the first comprehensive exhibition of China's economic construction held in Iraq.

Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim presided over the opening ceremony of the exhibition. Also present at the opening ceremony were Iraqi government ministers, the Governor of Baghdad Province, the Mayor of Baghdad, the Chairman of the Iraqi-Chinese Friendship Association, prominent figures from all walks of life, and more than a thousand diplomatic envoys from various countries to Iraq.

In his speech at the opening ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to Iraq Zhang Weilie said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China and the Iraqi Revolution of July 14th, which overthrew the reactionary monarchy, the traditional friendship between China and Iraq has been rapidly restored and developed. Over the past two years, the two countries have concluded trade and cultural agreements, and government and non-governmental delegations from both countries have visited each other, thus increasing mutual understanding and friendly relations between the Chinese and Iraqi peoples. He expressed his firm belief that this exhibition will further promote mutual understanding between the two peoples and further develop economic and trade relations between the two countries.

Ji Chaoding, head of the exhibition delegation, said in his introduction to the exhibition that the audience can see from this exhibition "the achievements of the Chinese people in carrying out national economic construction under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. They can also see the great victory of the three red banners of the general line of socialist construction in China, the Great Leap Forward in the national economy, and the people's communes." He also said that China is currently continuing the Great Leap Forward. The rapid and continuous development of China's national economy has greatly changed China's face and laid the foundation for making China a strong and prosperous socialist country. He hoped that through this exhibition, the Chinese and Iraqi peoples could exchange experiences in economic construction, learn from each other, and encourage each other, so as to promote the common prosperity of China and Iraq.

In his speech at the opening ceremony, Prime Minister Qasim expressed his pleasure in inaugurating the exhibition as a contribution to "the Republic of Iraq's friendship with the People's China." He pointed out that the friendly relations between China and Iraq have a long history. He also said: This exhibition definitely shows "the friendship between the Republic of Iraq and the People's China, a friendship that will grow and develop on the basis of mutual benefit."

After cutting the ribbon, Prime Minister Qasim, accompanied by Ambassador Zhang Weilie and Ji Chaoding, visited the exhibition. He wrote in the visitors' book: "I am very pleased to inaugurate and visit the economic construction exhibition of our people and our friendly People's China. I am even more pleased that during my short visit to several parts of the exhibition on November 5th, I confirmed that Chinese industry has made great progress, development, and prosperity. Undoubtedly, the Chinese people's commitment to peaceful national construction will ensure prosperity for the outstanding Chinese people and bring benefits to its friends around the world. This exhibition in Baghdad is solid proof of the determination of our two friendly countries to conduct fruitful cooperation in industry, economy, and trade for the happiness of the people of both friendly countries."
