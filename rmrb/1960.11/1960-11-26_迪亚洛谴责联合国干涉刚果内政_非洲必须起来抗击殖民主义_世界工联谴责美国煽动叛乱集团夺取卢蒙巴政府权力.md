Xinhua News Agency, Accra, November 24th: Abdoulaye Diallo, Secretary-General of the All-African People's Conference, held a press conference at the Secretariat of the All-African People's Conference on the 23rd, condemning the United Nations for intervening in the Congo and supporting the secessionist activities of Kasavubu and Tshombe, thus interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo.

Diallo emphasized that Africa is facing the danger of colonialism, as demonstrated by the events in the Congo, South Africa, and Algeria, and that Africa must rise up to resist colonialism. Diallo called on independent African countries to oppose the UN's support for Mobutu's plot to expel the Ghanaian Chargé d'Affaires from the Congo, and called on African leaders not to relax their efforts, as colonial forces are still desperately trying to maintain their control in Africa.

Diallo recalled the recent poisoning death of Félix Moumié, an African anti-colonial fighter, as well as the killings of nationalists in Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, and the Congo, saying: "These events make us more determined to persevere in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism to achieve the complete liberation of Africa."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 23rd: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram today to the President of the Fifteenth UN General Assembly, condemning Belgian colonialists and other imperialist countries led by the United States for interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo. The telegram pointed out that Belgian colonialists have made every effort to stage a comeback, while representatives of US financial and industrial enterprises are intensifying their conspiracies to separate certain areas from the Congo in order to maintain and increase their privileges and control the resources of Katanga. The telegram recounted that "certain member states of the United Nations, especially the United States, have carried out many incitements in an attempt to enable political and military factions serving these countries to seize the power of the constitutional parliament and the elected, and only legitimate, Lumumba government." The telegram continued, stating that the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions believes that this session of the United Nations General Assembly must listen to the opinions of Mr. Lumumba and the speakers of both houses of the constitutional Congolese Parliament.

The telegram demanded the restoration of the activities of the Congolese parliament, allowing the only legitimate government headed by Mr. Lumumba to fully exercise its sovereignty; recognition of Lumumba as the sole representative of the Congolese people to the United Nations General Assembly; condemnation and rejection of the interference of Belgian colonialists and other imperialist countries led by the United States in the internal affairs of the independent Congo; and that Congolese trade union organizations should be able to handle their own affairs without foreign interference so that they can contribute to the establishment of a normal life and the economic construction of the country.

    据新华社阿克拉24日电　全非人民大会秘书长阿卜杜拉·迪亚洛23日在全非人民大会秘书处举行记者招待会，谴责联合国对刚果进行干预，支持卡萨武布和冲伯的分裂活动，干涉刚果内政。
    迪亚洛强调说，非洲面临着在刚果、南非和阿尔及利亚发生的事件所表明的殖民主义危险，非洲必须起来抗击殖民主义。迪亚洛呼吁非洲独立国家反对联合国支持蒙博托把加纳代办驱逐出刚果的阴谋，并呼吁非洲领袖们不要放松努力，因为殖民主义势力仍然在拼命保持他们在非洲的控制。
    迪亚洛回顾了非洲反对殖民主义战士费利克斯·穆米埃最近被毒死以及阿尔及利亚、安哥拉、喀麦隆、刚果的一些民族主义者被杀害的事件之后说：“这些事件使得我们更加要坚持不懈地同帝国主义和殖民主义进行斗争，来争取非洲的彻底解放。”
    新华社布拉格23日电　世界工会联合会书记处今天打电报给第十五届联合国大会主席，谴责比利时殖民主义者和以美国为首的其他帝国主义国家干涉刚果内政。电报指出，比利时殖民主义者已经全力卷土重来，而美国金融和工业企业的代表正在加紧进行使某些地方脱离刚果的阴谋活动，以便保持和增加他们的特权，控制加丹加的资源。电报追叙说，“联合国的某些会员国，特别是美国，进行了多次煽动，企图使为这些国家服务的政治军事派系来攫取合乎宪法的议会和经选举产生的、唯一合法的卢蒙巴政府的权力。”电报接着说，世界工会联合会书记处认为，本届联合国大会必须听取卢蒙巴先生和合乎宪法的刚果议会两院议长的意见。
    电报要求，恢复刚果议会活动，让以卢蒙巴先生为首的唯一合法的政府充分行使主权；承认卢蒙巴为刚果人民出席联合国大会的唯一代表；谴责并拒绝比利时殖民主义者和以美国为首的其它帝国主义国家对独立的刚果内政的干涉；应当使刚果工会组织能够在没有外国干预的情况下处理自己的事务，以便使它们能够有助于建立正常的生活和本国的经济建设。
