Implementing the Procurement and Credit Policy, Focusing on Production and Regarding the Team as Home
    Dongxiang Financial and Trade Departments Promote the Development of Team-Owned Economy
    While Completing and Exceeding the Year's Procurement and Transfer Plans for Summer Grain, Pigs, etc. Ahead of Schedule, and Completing Fiscal Revenue Plans on Time Every Month

    (Our Dispatch from Nanchang, November 25th) The financial and trade departments of Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, have correctly implemented the Party's procurement and credit policies in rural areas, promoted the development of collectively owned economies of the production teams, and greatly increased the procurement volume of agricultural products.

    In their business activities, Dongxiang County's financial and trade departments have always paid attention to the comprehensive implementation of the Party's policies for rural people's communes, completing various financial and trade tasks on the basis of consolidating the communes and promoting production development. Especially since the launch of the production increase and conservation campaign centered on grain and steel, the Dongxiang County financial and trade departments, under the leadership of the County Party Committee, and adhering to the policy principle of three-level ownership with the production team as the foundation in rural people's communes, have further implemented the Party's policies to the teams in rural procurement, credit, and other financial and trade activities, proceeding from promoting production development in every aspect, and have achieved very significant results. The actual sown area of winter wheat and rapeseed in more than 200 production brigades in the county this year is three times that of last year, and the team-run winter sideline production has also gained vigorous development. In addition, half of the 73 poor teams in the county have caught up with the rich teams, and the other half have basically shaken off the appearance of poor teams. The simultaneous development of team-owned and commune-owned economies has greatly promoted the successful completion of the county's financial and trade tasks. By the end of October, the annual procurement and transfer plans for summer grain, live pigs, poultry, and other agricultural and sideline products had been completed ahead of schedule, and all fiscal revenue plans had been completed on time every month; the revenue to loan ratio increased by 30% compared with the same period last year.

    In order to ensure the correct implementation of the Party's procurement and credit policies, the Dongxiang County Party Committee has continuously conducted in-depth ideological education on the policy of three-level ownership with the production team as the foundation in rural people's communes among all financial and trade cadres. Since the beginning of this year, the Dongxiang County financial and trade departments, according to the instructions of the County Party Committee, have organized all cadres to discuss how to better implement the Party's policies for rural people's communes, and combined this with summing up and inspecting the work of the previous stage. Through discussions, all financial and trade cadres have become increasingly clear that to successfully complete financial and trade tasks, it is first necessary to promote the development of production, and to promote production, the key lies in resolutely establishing the policy ideology of three-level ownership with the production team as the foundation in rural people's communes, and correctly implementing procurement and credit policies; at the same time, according to the principle of three-level ownership with the team as the foundation, attention should be paid to promoting the development of team-owned economy in the work. On this basis, the financial and trade departments have further improved their work style. In addition to frequently going deep into the brigades, deep into the masses, and deep into the front line of production, they have also organized more than 100 financial and trade cadres to reside in the production brigades for a long time, and in the process of participating in production, they continuously inspect and understand the implementation of financial and trade policies, find out the production situation and needs of the brigades, and take timely measures to promote the development of team-owned economy. Many financial and trade cadres have put forward the slogan "Facing production, regarding the team as home." For example, Deng Chou, the director of the Zhanxu Tax Office, changed the past practice of "collecting taxes on goods and waiting for taxes to come to the door," resolutely walked out of the tax office and settled in the Longgangshan Brigade as a pilot to support poor teams. In the process of production, he not only deeply publicized the state's tax policies to the masses, encouraging the brigade to develop production actively, but also promptly discovered the problem that this brigade lacked funds to develop sideline production, and immediately helped to raise production funds, enabling the brigade to quickly develop sideline production such as pig raising, chicken and duck raising, fish farming, brick and tile making, and charcoal burning.

    On the basis of improving the policy thinking of financial and trade cadres, the Dongxiang County financial and trade departments correctly implemented the procurement and credit policies, and unified the implementation of the Party's policies with the completion of financial and trade tasks. In the work of procuring pigs, the commercial departments implemented various specific policies, which not only completed the state's procurement tasks, but also took care of the interests of the production teams and commune members, promoting the development of the pig raising industry. Now the number of team-run pig farms in the county has developed to nearly a thousand, with more than 25,000 pigs in stock, more than double that of last year. During the summer harvest distribution this year, the banking departments, taking the team as the unit, directly settled various loans with the brigade and jointly negotiated repayment methods, which also played a positive role in promoting production. For example, the Xiahuang Commune's Xiahudui Brigade was a poor team. During the summer harvest distribution, the bank cadres stationed in this team jointly settled accounts with the brigade cadres and helped the production team to make overall arrangements for the team's production expenses, commune members' wages, and various outstanding payments. As a result of the final consultation, more than 1,000 yuan of overdue loans could not be repaid on time, so the bank took the initiative to postpone the repayment date of the loan. The commune members of the whole commune put forward the slogan of striving for a winter to change the face of the poor team, and have been at the forefront of all the brigades in the commune in winter agricultural and sideline production, determined to repay the bank's loan in advance.

    The Dongxiang County financial and trade departments also took the initiative to help the brigades solve the difficulties in developing production through purchase, sales, collection, storage and other business activities. This winter, the county's sown area of wheat has increased by more than twice that of last year, and the production teams of various communes felt that there was a shortage of wheat seeds. The grain departments took the initiative to exchange a large number of wheat seeds from neighboring counties with rice. The Gangtang Brigade of Dongyuan Commune only planted dozens of mu of wheat last year and did not retain many seeds. This winter, it plans to plant 170 mu. After the grain department took the initiative to supply a large number of wheat seeds, the brigade took advantage of the winter fallow land and raw and cooked wasteland to sow more than 600 mu of wheat in one go. When a pig raising boom was set off throughout the county, the production teams, small teams, and canteens all needed bricks, tiles, large pots, feed, and funds to set up pig farms. The commercial departments actively supported them in various ways. If there was a shortage of funds, they promptly issued advance purchase deposits for pigs; if there was not enough feed, they sent people to buy water hyacinth seeds from other places to breed feed; if large iron pots were needed to cook swill, they helped the brigades with the conditions to set up boiler factories and organized the supply of a large amount of scrap iron and charcoal, and invited technicians from other places to guide sand casting; if there were no bricks and tiles, they helped the brigades build brick, tile, and lime kilns for self-burning and self-use. In this way, they finally helped the major brigades to successfully set up a large number of team-owned pig farms.

    贯彻收购信贷政策　面向生产以队为家
    东乡财贸部门促进队有经济发展
    同时提前超额完成全年夏粮生猪等收购上调计划，月月按时完成财政税收计划
    本报南昌25日电　江西省东乡县财贸部门正确贯彻执行党在农村的收购、信贷政策，促进了公社队有经济的发展，同时农产品收购量也大大增加。
    东乡县财贸部门在自己的业务活动中，一向注意全面贯彻党对农村人民公社的各项政策，在巩固公社、促使生产发展的基础上完成各项财贸工作。特别是以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动开展以后，东乡县财贸部门在县委的领导下，本着农村人民公社三级所有、队为基础的政策原则，在农村的收购、信贷等财贸活动中，进一步把党的政策贯彻到队，处处从促进生产发展出发，获得了十分显著的成效。全县二百多个生产大队，今年冬种小麦、油菜的实播面积等于去年的三倍，队营的冬季副业生产也获得了蓬勃发展。此外，全县七十三个穷队中已有一半赶上了富队，另一半也基本摆脱了穷队面貌。队有经济和社有经济同时大发展，大大促进了全县财贸任务的胜利完成。到10月底止，夏粮、生猪、家禽等农副产品的全年收购、上调计划，均已先后提前超额完成，各项财政税收计划都月月按时完成；收贷比去年同期增长30％。
    为了使党的收购、信贷政策正确地贯彻执行，中共东乡县委不断地在全体财贸干部中深入进行农村人民公社三级所有、队为基础的政策思想教育。今年以来，东乡县财贸部门根据县委指示，曾经组织全体干部，围绕着如何更好地贯彻党对农村人民公社的政策，并结合着总结检查前一段的工作，进行了讨论。通过讨论，全体财贸干部越来越明确地认识到：要胜利完成财贸任务，首先就要促进生产的发展，而要促进生产，关键又在于坚决树立农村人民公社三级所有、队为基础的政策思想，正确贯彻收购、信贷政策；同时，根据三级所有、队为基础的原则，在工作中要注意促进队有经济的发展。在此基础上，财贸部门又进一步改进了工作作风，除了经常深入大队、深入群众、深入生产第一线以外，还组织了一百多名财贸干部长驻生产大队，在参加生产的过程中，不断检查了解财贸政策的执行情况，摸清大队生产的情况和需要，及时采取措施促进队有经济的发展。许多财贸干部都提出了“面向生产，以队为家”的口号。如占圩税务所所长邓丑，改变过去“有货收税、等税上门”的作风，坚决走出税务所办公室，深入到龙岗山大队安家落户，作为支援穷队的试点。在生产过程中，他不仅向群众深入宣传了国家税收政策，鼓舞大队发展生产的积极性，而且及时发现了这个大队发展副业生产缺乏资金的问题，便立即帮助筹集了生产资金，使这个大队迅速开展了养猪、养鸡鸭、养鱼、做砖瓦、烧木炭等副业生产。
    在提高财贸干部政策思想的基础上，东乡县财贸部门正确贯彻执行收购、信贷政策，把执行党的政策和完成财贸任务统一起来。商业部门在收购毛猪工作中，贯彻各项具体政策，既完成国家收购任务，又照顾了生产队和社员的利益，促进了养猪事业的发展。现在全县队营的养猪场，已发展到近千个，存栏猪达二万五千多头，比去年增加一倍以上。今年夏收分配时，银行部门做到了以队为单位，直接和大队结算各项贷款，共同协商归还办法，对促进生产也起了积极作用。如小璜公社下湖大队是个穷队，夏收分配中，驻在这个队的银行干部便和大队干部一起共同结算，帮助生产队统筹安排队的生产费用、社员工资和各项欠款。最后协商结果，还有一千多元到期贷款无法按期归还，银行便主动把这笔贷款归还日期推迟。全社社员提出奋战一冬改变穷队面貌的口号，在冬季农副业生产中一直走在全社各个大队的前头，决心提前归还银行的这部分贷款。
    东乡县财贸部门还通过购、销、收、存等业务活动，主动帮助大队解决发展生产中的困难。今冬全县播种小麦面积比去年增加二倍多，各公社生产队都感到麦种不足。粮食部门便主动用稻谷从邻县换进大批麦种。东源公社纲塘大队去年只种几十亩小麦，留种不多，今冬计划种一百七十亩，粮食部门主动供应了大批麦种后，这个大队利用冬闲田地和生熟荒地，一口气就播下了六百多亩小麦。当全县各地掀起养猪热潮时，各生产队、小队和食堂都需要砖瓦、大锅、饲料和资金办养猪场。商业部门便积极从各方面加以扶植。资金不足，他们及时发放毛猪预购定金；饲料不够，便派人到外地去购买了水浮莲种籽来繁殖饲料；需要大铁锅煮馊，他们便帮助有条件的大队办起锅炉厂，并组织供应了大批废铁、木炭，又从外地请来技工指导翻砂铸锅；砖瓦没有，便帮大队筹建砖瓦、石灰窑，自烧自用。这样，终于帮助各大队顺利地办起了大批队有养猪场。
