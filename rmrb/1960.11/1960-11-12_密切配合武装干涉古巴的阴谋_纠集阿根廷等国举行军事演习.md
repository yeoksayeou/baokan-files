　　Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires Dispatch: The United States, starting from the 3rd, has colluded with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay to hold naval "Joint Action" exercises in the South Atlantic. This is another stage of the large-scale military exercises instigated and directed by the United States, which began on August 29th. The purpose of the United States in instigating this exercise is to create a tense atmosphere and strengthen military control over Latin American countries. This is in close coordination with the United States' stepped-up conspiracy of armed intervention in Cuba.

　　This phase of the exercise, which began on the 3rd and will end in late November, will include a series of items such as anti-submarine warfare and patrolling. The area of activity extends from Patagonia in Argentina to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. In addition to U.S. warships, the U.S. fleet's air wing is also participating in the exercise. Senior naval officers from the participating countries will also gather in Rio de Janeiro at the end.

　　This entire exercise is the first joint military exercise held by the United States in conjunction with South American countries with navies. In previous phases, the United States has successively conducted anti-submarine exercises with naval forces in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile.

    密切配合武装干涉古巴的阴谋
    纠集阿根廷等国举行军事演习
    新华社讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：美国3日起纠集阿根廷、巴西和乌拉圭三国在南大西洋海面举行海军“联合行动”演习。这是从8月29日开始的由美国策动和指挥的大规模军事演习的另一阶段。美国策动这个演习的目的在于制造紧张气氛和加强对拉丁美洲国家的军事控制。这是同美国正在加紧进行的武装干涉古巴的阴谋密切配合的。
    从3日开始到11月下旬结束的这一阶段的演习将包括反潜艇作战、巡逻等一系列项目。活动的地区从阿根廷的巴塔哥尼亚到巴西的里约热内卢。除了美国军舰以外，美国舰队的航空队也参加演习。参加演习的各国的海军高级将领最后还将在里约热内卢聚会。
    整个这次演习是美国纠合有海军的南美各国举行的第一次联合军事演习。以前几个阶段里，美国已经先后同在委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、秘鲁和智利的海军部队举行了反潜艇演习。
