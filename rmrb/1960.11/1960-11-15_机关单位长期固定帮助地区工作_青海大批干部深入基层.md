    Organs and Units Provide Long-Term, Fixed Assistance to Regional Work
    Large Numbers of Cadres in Qinghai Go Deep into the Grassroots
    (Our Dispatch) In Qinghai Province, organs and units at all levels have adopted the method of fixing targets, assigning responsibilities, and taking charge of everything from start to finish, drawing a large number of cadres to work in various prefectures, cities, counties, communes, and production teams, to further strengthen leadership over the agricultural front and grassroots work.
    The practice of organs and units at all levels dividing up and taking long-term responsibility for assisting the work of a region is a major measure taken by the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to deeply implement the guiding principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and developing agricultural production at high speed. At present, all provincial-level organs and units in Qinghai Province, based on their specific circumstances, have adopted individual or joint methods to take charge of assisting the work of the province's forty-six counties and cities; the various organs and units of counties, cities, and communes have also proceeded from the specific conditions of each locality to ensure that prefectures, counties, and cities take charge of communes, and various departments of communes take charge of production teams. All organs and units have drawn a large number of cadres to go to the areas they are responsible for, and under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, they have gone deep into the masses, deep into reality, vigorously carried out investigation and research work, actively helped grassroots cadres come up with ideas and methods, and conscientiously solved every specific problem, so that all production and work can be carried out both vigorously and solidly. Among the cadres drawn from various organs, a large number are leading cadres. According to incomplete statistics, during the spring plowing and sowing, field management, and summer harvest periods in the Xining area alone, nearly one hundred leading cadres from provincial and municipal organs, including secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, deputy governors, heads of various departments, bureaus, and municipal Party secretaries, went to work at the grassroots level. In the six communes of the Republican County of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, each commune now has a leading cadre above the county committee member level stationed in the commune to help with work; and each of the twenty production brigades also has a county-level section or bureau chief cadre or a commune Party secretary or commune director there to help with work.
    In Qinghai Province, the practice of organs and units at all levels taking charge of assisting the work of a region has gradually developed from a short-term, non-fixed target approach in the past to a fixed target, long-term responsibility approach. This new method has shown many advantages: First, because the areas with fixed long-term responsibility are fixed, and responsibilities are clarified, the various organs and units and the Party organizations in the areas they are responsible for must jointly take full responsibility for local work, which further strengthens the sense of responsibility of the various organs and units, thereby making them more concerned about the various production and work in the areas they are responsible for; second, after fixing long-term targets, an organ generally only takes charge of the work of one area (county, city, commune, brigade, production team), which can better concentrate forces and provide comprehensive assistance and support to the area it is responsible for in terms of manpower, materials, and other aspects; third, after fixing the target of taking charge of, cadres of organs and units at all levels work in one area for a long time, eating, living, working, and consulting with the masses, which allows them to understand the situation in all aspects more deeply, making the work more thorough, meticulous, and down-to-earth; at the same time, it is also more conducive to the labor training of cadres.
    In order to better implement this measure, recently, organs and units at all levels in Qinghai Province have further made proper arrangements for internal work within the organs in order to continue to draw cadres to go deep into the areas they are responsible for to work. (Attached picture)

    机关单位长期固定帮助地区工作
    青海大批干部深入基层
    本报讯　青海省各级机关单位采取固定对象、分工包干、一包到底的办法，抽调大批干部到各州、市、县、公社、生产队工作，进一步加强对农业战线和基层工作的领导。
    各级机关单位分工长期包干帮助一个地区的工作，这是中共青海省委为了深入贯彻执行国民经济以农业为基础、高速度发展农业生产方针的一个重大措施。现在，青海省的各个省级机关单位，都根据本单位的具体情况，采取单独或联合的方式，分别包干帮助全省四十六个县、市的工作；县、市、公社的各个机关单位也都从各地的具体情况出发，做到了州、县、市包公社，公社各部门包生产队。各个机关单位都抽调大批干部下到所包地区，在当地党委的统一领导下，深入群众，深入实际，大力开展调查研究工作，积极帮助基层干部出主意、想办法，认真地解决每一个具体问题，使各项生产和工作进行得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。在各机关抽调的干部中，有很大一批是领导干部，据不完全统计，仅西宁地区在春耕播种、田间管理和夏收期间，到基层工作的省、市机关领导干部就有省委书记处书记、副省长、各厅、部、局长、市委书记等近一百人。海南藏族自治州共和县的六个公社，现在每个公社都有一名县委委员以上的领导干部住社帮助工作；二十个生产大队也都各有一名县级科、部长级干部或公社党委书记、公社主任在那里帮助工作。
    青海省各级机关单位包干帮助一个地区的工作，在实行过程中逐渐由过去短期的、不固定对象的办法，发展到了固定对象、长期包干的办法。这种新的方法已经显示出许多优点：一、由于固定了长期包干的地区，明确了责任，各个机关单位同所包地区党的组织要共同对当地工作全面负责，这样就进一步加强了各个机关单位的责任感，从而更加关心所包地区的各项生产和工作；二、固定长期包干对象后，一个机关一般都只包一个地区（县、市、公社、大队、生产队）的工作，可以更好地集中力量，从人力、物力等各个方面给予所包地区以全面的帮助和支援；三、固定包干对象以后，各级机关单位的干部长期在一个地区工作，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，可以更加深入地了解各个方面的情况，使工作做得更加深入、细致、踏实；同时也更加有利于干部的劳动锻炼。
    为了更好地贯彻执行这一措施，最近青海省各级机关单位，都进一步对机关内部工作作了妥善安排，以便继续抽调干部深入包干地区工作。（附图片）
