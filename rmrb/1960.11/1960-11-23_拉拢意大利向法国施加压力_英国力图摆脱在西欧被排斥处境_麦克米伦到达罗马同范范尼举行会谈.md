Xinhua News Agency, Rome, November 22nd: British Prime Minister Macmillan arrived in Rome on the 21st for a two-day visit and held his first official talks with Italian Prime Minister Fanfani in the evening. Accompanying Macmillan were British Foreign Secretary Home and others.

Western newspapers, commenting on this British-Italian meeting, believe that the "main issue" to be discussed will be the relationship between the six-nation Western European "Common Market," led by West Germany and France, and the seven-nation Western European "Free Trade Association," led by Britain. Sources say that Britain will try its best to win Italy's support for the British position in the talks, in order to divide the six "Common Market" countries and escape its situation of being excluded in Continental Western Europe. At the same time, Britain hopes to put pressure on France, which is unwilling to "bridge" the gap between the two opposing economic blocs in Western Europe, by luring Italy.

Sources say that Macmillan and Fanfani will also discuss East-West relations, relations with the United States, including the US demand that Western European countries pay money to share the burden of the US's serious foreign payment crisis, and other issues.

After Macmillan's visit, French Prime Minister Debré and Foreign Minister Couve de Murville will then visit Italy. West German Chancellor Adenauer will visit London in mid-December. The six "Common Market" countries and the seven "Free Trade Association" countries will hold meetings in December respectively. This series of diplomatic activities by Western European countries is a continuation and development of the intense diplomatic maneuvering that has unfolded among them since the beginning of this year.

    拉拢意大利向法国施加压力
    英国力图摆脱在西欧被排斥处境
    麦克米伦到达罗马同范范尼举行会谈
    新华社22日讯　罗马消息：英国首相麦克米伦21日到达罗马作为期两天的访问，并在晚上同意大利总理范范尼举行了第一次正式会谈。随同麦克米伦前来的有英国外交大臣霍姆等人。
    西方报刊在评论英—意这次会谈时认为，他们讨论的“主要问题”将是以西德和法国为首的西欧“共同市场”六国和以英国为首的西欧“自由贸易联盟”七国间的关系。有消息说，英国在会谈中将竭力争取意大利对英国立场的支持，以便分化“共同市场”六国，摆脱它在西欧大陆被排斥的处境。英国同时希望通过拉拢意大利，来对不愿在西欧两个对立的经济集团之间“搭桥”的法国施加压力。
    消息说，麦克米伦和范范尼还将讨论东西方关系、同美国关系包括美国要西欧国家出钱来分担美国严重的对外支付危机等问题。
    在麦克米伦的访问后，法国总理德勃雷和外交部长德姆维尔将接着到意大利访问。西德总理阿登纳在12月中旬访问伦敦。“共同市场”六国和西欧“自由贸易联盟”七国分别在12月举行会议。西欧国家这一连串的外交活动，是今年以来在它们之间展开的纵横捭阖的活动的继续和发展。
