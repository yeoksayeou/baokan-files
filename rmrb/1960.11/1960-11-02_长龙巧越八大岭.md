Long Dragon Skillfully Crosses the Eight Great Ridges

    The Anshan Transportation Company Party Committee, in order to transport thousands of tons of refractory clay from Huazi to the Anshan Refractory Materials Factory in a timely manner, assigned this task to the No. 35 Red Flag driver Liu Shigui's team.

    To get to Huazi, you have to pass seven or eight high mountains and ridges. Liu Shigui and his partners decided to scout the route first. They climbed to the top of the mountain and saw: the mountains were high and steep, rugged and uneven, the road was as narrow as a long snake, and on both sides of the road were mountain ravines and deep abysses. The drivers discussed:

      "Even if the truck runs bare, we'll be nervous. We can't tow a trailer!"

    What to do? The task was urgent, the goods were plentiful, and the road was difficult. Liu Shigui felt uneasy.

  “If the truck doesn't tow a trailer, the transportation capacity is too low, and it will be difficult to complete the task on time; if it tows a trailer, it is indeed difficult!" He thought again: "Roads are made by people. As long as we pay attention to the difficulties during operation and take concrete measures to overcome the difficulties, we can complete this transportation task." Thinking of this, he made up his mind: "In order to support the leap forward in iron and steel, even if there are ten thousand difficulties, I will make one car do the work of several cars and climb up with a trailer."

    High mountains and steep ridges cannot stop the wheels of progress. Liu Shigui and his partners immediately studied countermeasures and adopted the method of "segmental detachment and attachment" to ensure the safe driving of the car downhill and through sharp turns, and realized trailer transportation on high mountains. But Liu Shigui was not satisfied with this achievement. He and his partner Du Shuzhi picked up waste materials such as twisted axles and planetary gears from the scrap iron pile, installed a power booster on the car, and increased the number of trailers from two to four or five. In this way, they climbed over high mountains and ridges, creating a daily output of more than 9,700 ton-kilometers, and overfulfilled the arduous transportation task.

    长龙巧越八大岭
    鞍山运输公司党委为了把上千吨的耐火土从铧子及时运到鞍山耐火材料厂，就把这个任务交给了三十五号红旗司机刘士贵小队。
    去铧子得路过七、八个高山大岭。刘士贵和他的伙伴们决定先去探路。他们登上山顶一看：山高壁陡，崎岖不平，公路狭窄得像万丈长蛇，公路两旁是山涧深渊。司机们议论着：
      “汽车光腚跑，也得提心吊胆，这可不敢带拖车啊！”
    怎么办？任务紧，货物多，路又难行。刘士贵心里忐忑不安。
  “汽车要是不带拖车，运输能力太低，很难按时完成任务；要是带拖车，确实困难啊！”他又想：“路是人走出来的，只要在运行中重视困难，采取战胜困难的具体措施，就能够完成这次运输任务。”想到这里，他下定决心：“为了支援钢铁跃进，就是有万重困难，我也要使一台车顶几台车用，带着拖车爬上去。”
    高山峻岭，挡不住前进的车轮。刘士贵和他的伙伴马上研究对策，采取“分节甩挂”的办法，保证了汽车下山坡过急道的安全行驶，实现了在高山上进行拖挂运输。但是刘士贵在这个成绩面前，并不满足。他和自己的伙伴杜树智从废铁堆里拣来了麻花轴、行星齿轮等废旧器材，在汽车上安装了加力箱，使汽车由拖二个挂车增加到四、五个，这样他们爬过高山大岭，创造了日产九千七百多吨公里的成绩，超额地完成了艰巨的运输任务。
