    The teachers and students of universities, middle schools, and primary schools in Jiangxi Province resolutely responded to the Party's call to "vigorously develop agriculture and grain production" and actively supported the autumn harvest and winter planting.
    The teachers and students not only enthusiastically supported the rural people's communes with labor, but also tried their best to provide support in technology and culture. Jiangxi Agricultural College, Engineering College, Medical College, Teachers College, etc., actively manufactured agricultural tools such as electric motors, water pumps, and threshers according to the different characteristics of their majors; promoted the superior varieties they cultivated; manufactured pesticides to eliminate pests; and sent medical personnel to the countryside to directly serve agricultural production.

Shenyang Troops Eliminate Rats and Dig Up Large Quantities of Grain
    A certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Shenyang area recently used training breaks and holidays to dig rat holes in the harvested fields. In more than ten days, they eliminated more than 24,000 rats and dug up more than 260,000 jin of soil grain. After deducting 40% of impurities, the pure grain was more than 156,000 jin.
    The more than 20,000 rat skins obtained by this unit are worth more than 1,500 yuan; rat meat that has been tested to be virus-free is a good chicken feed; the 130,000 jin of soybeans dug up can be used to extract oil, producing more than 10,000 jin of oil, and the remaining soybean cake can be used to raise pigs, providing enough concentrated feed for 1,000 pigs for a year.

Tibetan Medical Personnel in Shannan, Tibet, Grow Rapidly
    Tibetan medical personnel are growing rapidly in the Shannan area of Tibet. All twelve county hospitals in the special district have Tibetan junior medical personnel. More than 80% of the districts in each county have established health stations and launched a mass patriotic health campaign.
    With the growth of Tibetan medical personnel, the number of medical personnel in the entire Shannan special district has increased more than tenfold compared with before the suppression of the rebellion. The quality of medical work has greatly improved, the number of people seeking medical treatment has increased day by day, and it has played a great role in ensuring people's health.

Shenzao Agricultural Middle School Graduates Show Their Skills in the Three Autumn Campaigns
    The first 227 graduating students of Shenzao Agricultural Middle School in Dongtai County, Jiangsu, were assigned to 25 brigades and 150 production teams of the commune to work in the fields. Party organizations at all levels attach great importance to this group of graduates. The commune Party committee convened a meeting of the heads of major brigades, requiring them to be responsible for helping these young people. In the autumn sowing training, the secretary of the commune Party committee personally imparted technology.
    This group of graduates played a good role in the "Three Autumn" campaigns. Chen Yuanji, a graduate of the Agricultural Middle School from Chenguang Brigade, brought tools to the fields for repairs, ensuring that the plows did not stop working. He also improved the furrow opener, increasing the output of furrow opening, and trial-produced a seeding machine for both sunny and rainy days.

Changwei Agricultural College Diligently and Frugally Runs the School with the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" Spirit
    Changwei Agricultural College in Shandong was established in the Great Leap Forward of 1958. Over the past two years, under the leadership of the Party, teachers and students have learned the spirit of running the school in Yan'an's "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" during the Anti-Japanese War, and the entire school's teachers and students have launched a movement to work and study diligently and run the school frugally. The school is now taking initial shape.
    From the beginning of its establishment, the school Party committee insisted on educating teachers, students, and staff to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity of the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University," often telling students stories of the hard struggle of the old Red Army. Therefore, all teachers and students have developed a good habit of focusing on the big picture and starting from small things, increasing income and reducing expenditure, being diligent and frugal, and saving everywhere. Since the establishment of the school, all house repairs, installation and repair of desks, chairs, beds, doors and windows have been done by teachers and students themselves, with little outside help. As a result, there has been a surplus of funds every year, saving the country 60,000 yuan in two years.
