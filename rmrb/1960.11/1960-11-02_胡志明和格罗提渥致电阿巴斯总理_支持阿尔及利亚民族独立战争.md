Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 1st: President Ho Chi Minh sent a telegram to Ferhat Abbas, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, warmly congratulating the sixth anniversary of the Algerian national liberation war and expressing his complete support for the just struggle of the Algerian people.

The telegram stated that in the past six years, the heroic and arduous struggle of the Algerian people has achieved many great victories and has increasingly gained the sympathy and support of Asian and African countries and peace-loving people around the world. Under the leadership of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, headed by Prime Minister Abbas, the just struggle of the Algerian people will surely achieve final victory, and the Algerian nation will achieve independence.

The Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, the Vietnam Committee for the Struggle for Algerian Independence, and the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor also sent telegrams to the Algerian National Liberation Front and the Algerian General Union of Labor on October 31, warmly congratulating the sixth anniversary of the Algerian national liberation war.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 1st: Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, sent a telegram to Abbas, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of Algeria, expressing support for the Algerian people's struggle for self-determination and national independence.

On behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic, he expressed sincere friendship and solidarity with the Algerian people and stated that he would continue to provide all possible material assistance.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic also issued a statement expressing support for the just struggle waged by the Algerian people. The statement exposed the West German government's political, economic, and military support to the French colonial government. It said that since May 1955, more than 35,000 West German mercenaries have fought against Algerians. In this war, more than 8,500 West Germans have died. The statement said that most of the West German soldiers and regular officers were former German SS and Hitler's army officers. According to a decision of the West German Federal Parliament in May 1960, service in the French Foreign Legion is now regarded as regular military service in the West German army.

The statement concluded by saying that the government of the German Democratic Republic resolutely and unequivocally condemns the West German government for supporting French monopoly capital in carrying out a dirty war in Algeria forever.

    支持阿尔及利亚民族独立战争
    新华社河内1日电　胡志明主席打电报给阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯·费尔哈特，热烈祝贺阿尔及利亚民族独立战争六周年，并表示彻底支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争。
    电文说，六年来，阿尔及利亚人民英勇和艰苦的斗争已经取得了许多巨大的胜利，并日益得到亚非国家和世界爱好和平人民的同情与支持。在以阿巴斯总理为首的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府的领导下，阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争一定将取得最后的胜利，阿尔及利亚国家将取得独立。
    越南亚非人民团结委员会、越南争取阿尔及利亚独立斗争委员会和越南总工会，10月31日也分别打电报给阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线和阿尔及利亚劳工总同盟，热烈祝贺阿尔及利亚民族独立战争六周年。
    新华社柏林1日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥致电阿尔及利亚临时政府总理阿巴斯，表示支持阿尔及利亚人民争取自决权和民族独立的斗争。
    他代表德意志民主共和国政府表示对阿尔及利亚人民的真诚的友谊和声援；并且表示将继续提供一切可能的物质援助。
    德意志民主共和国外交部也发表声明，表示支持阿尔及利亚人民进行的正义的斗争。这项声明揭露了西德政府给法国殖民政府以政治、经济和军事上的支持。它说，从1955年5月起，已经有三五万千多名西德雇佣军同阿尔及利亚人交战。在这场战争中，有八千五百多个西德人丧生。声明说，大部分西德士兵和正规军官是前德国党卫军和希特勒的陆军军官。据1960年5月西德联邦议会的决定，在法国外籍军团中服役，现在被视为是在西德陆军中服正规军役。
    声明最后说，德意志民主共和国政府决然断然地谴责西德政府支持法国垄断资本永在阿尔及利亚进行肮脏的战争。
