    To ensure that commune members can use spades, hoes, mattocks, and sickles with ease during spring plowing,
    Shanxi County and Commune Industries are Intensifying the Repair and Manufacture of Small Farm Tools
    (Our newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 27th) Shanxi Province's county and commune industries are launching a major campaign to repair and manufacture small farm tools, so that every laborer can have several handy tools before next year's spring plowing. Currently, the planned production of spades, hoes, mattocks, and sickles totals more than 3 million pieces, exceeding any previous year. Two million of these are to be produced this winter, and the rest will be manufactured before spring plowing.
    Before the campaign started, relevant units in various localities conducted thorough investigations in rural areas. Based on farmers' demands, they generally prioritized spades, hoes, mattocks, and sickles for small farm tool repair and manufacture. During the investigation and research, county and commune factories also planned the specifications, varieties, and quantities of small farm tools separately, taking into account the needs of different areas such as mountainous regions and plains. In addition, they worked with local farmers to select and evaluate models of small farm tools to find production samples.
    The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agricultural Machinery recently made specific arrangements for this work, allocating more than 18,000 tons of steel for farm tools and more than 1,600 tons of cutting steel to factories repairing and manufacturing small farm tools.
    In the campaign to repair and manufacture small farm tools, various localities generally implemented a policy focusing on repair, combined with manufacturing and repair work. Special districts, counties, and commune industries made clear divisions of labor: the manufacturing and repair tasks for larger agricultural machinery were undertaken by larger agricultural machinery factories run by special districts and counties; some county-run factories and commune factories were responsible for manufacturing small farm tools; and small farm tool repair work was done by commune-level farm tool factories and repair shops. In this way, each region was able to ensure the completion of large-scale agricultural machinery repair and manufacturing tasks while also assigning dedicated forces to manufacture and repair small farm tools. Qingtao Commune in Yuncheng County organized blacksmiths and carpenters from production teams to establish a small farm tool repair network, allowing the commune agricultural machinery factory to concentrate on manufacturing small farm tools. Currently, this commune has produced more than 21,000 various small farm tools and has repaired a large number of existing small farm tools.
    Many factories responsible for manufacturing small farm tools are linked to larger factories, making full use of the waste materials, scrap materials, and surplus materials from the larger factories. The forging workshop of the Qin County Agricultural Machinery Factory manufactured nearly 4,000 small farm tools such as sickles, iron shovels, and mattocks just by using various small materials, block materials, and scrap materials. Some factories responsible for repair work also adopted methods such as refurbishing old items to save raw materials and reduce production costs. (Photo Attached)

    保证公社社员在春耕中使用锹锄镢镰得心应手
    山西县社工业抓紧修造小农具
    本报太原27日电　山西省的县、社工业正在开展一个大修大造小农具的运动，以便在明年春耕以前使每个劳动力都能得到几件得心应手的工具。目前，各地已经安排生产的锹、锄、镢、镰四种小农具共达三百多万件，超过以往任何一年。其中的二百万件要在今冬生产出来，其余的也要在春耕前全部造好。
    运动开展以前，各地有关单位都深入农村进行了调查，根据农民要求，普遍把锹、锄、镢、镰作为小农具修造的重点。在调查研究中，各县、社工厂还针对山地、平川等不同地区的需要，对小农具生产的规格、品种、数量分别进行了规划。另外，他们还同当地农民一起对小农具作了选型鉴定，找出了生产样本。
    山西省农业机械厅最近也对这项工作作了具体安排，调拨了一万八千多吨农具用钢和一千六百多吨刃钢给修造小农具的工厂。
    各地在小农具的修造运动中，普遍实行了以修为主、制造和修理紧密结合。专区、县和公社工业作了明确分工：较大的农业机具的制造和修配任务，由专区、县营较大的农具厂担负；一些县营工厂和公社工厂担负小农具的制造任务；小农具修理工作由公社里的农具厂和修配厂等来做。这样，就使各个地区在保证完成大型农业机具的修配制造任务的同时，又固定了专门力量制造和修理小农具。运城县卿桃公社把生产小队的铁匠、木匠组织起来建立小农具修理网，使公社农业机械厂集中精力制造小农具。现在，这个公社已经生产出各种小农具二万一千多件，同时修理了大批旧有的小农具。
    许多担负小农具制造任务的工厂都同大厂挂钩，充分利用大厂的废料、边料和余料。沁县农业机械厂锻工车间仅利用各种小料、块料和边料就制出镰刀、铁锹、镢头等小农具近四千件。一些担负修配任务的工厂也采取以旧翻新等办法节约原料材料，降低了生产成本。（附图片）
