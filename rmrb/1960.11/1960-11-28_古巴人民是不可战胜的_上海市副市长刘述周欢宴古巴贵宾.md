Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 27th: Shanghai Vice Mayor Liu Shuzhou held a banquet this evening to welcome the distinguished guests of Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation led by Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara, President of the National bank of Cuba.

Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, attended the banquet.

The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The hosts and guests frequently proposed toasts to the fighting friendship between the people of China and Cuba, and to the victory of the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Vice Mayor Liu Shuzhou spoke at the banquet. On behalf of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee and the people of Shanghai, he extended a warm welcome to the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation headed by Major Guevara for their visit to Shanghai. He said that the common struggle against U.S. imperialism has long established a fighting friendship between us and the Cuban people. We follow the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. imperialism with boundless admiration, and we angrily condemn the economic blockade and armed threats imposed on the Cuban people by U.S. imperialism. We will resolutely support the just struggle of the Cuban people with all possible strength. He said: We firmly believe that any aggression by U.S. imperialism against Cuba will be met with a shameful defeat, and the awakened and united Cuban people are invincible.

Major Guevara spoke at the banquet, saying that during this short trip in China, we have seen huge bridges, huge metallurgical enterprises, and also small bearing factories and small hydropower stations created by the wisdom of the people. From this, we clearly understand the correctness of the "walking on two legs" policy stipulated by the Chinese government.

He said that in the past, we only knew some of the characteristics of Shanghai from books. That was old Shanghai created by imperialists and colonialists, but today we have seen the new Shanghai with our own eyes. People are very healthy, full of energy, and very happy in building socialism.

He spoke about the Shanghai Export Commodities Exhibition Hall he visited this afternoon. He said that from the displayed goods, we also see the new aspects of Shanghai, which are also the new aspects of China. This may seem like small things, but it shows that socialism has defeated capitalism in all aspects.

Major Guevara enthusiastically said that we are very honored to be the first American country to establish diplomatic relations with China. But I believe we are definitely not the last. For this, I propose a toast to our friendship.

Also present at the banquet this evening were: Shanghai Vice Mayors Song Richang, Song Jiwen, and Zhao Zukang; Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Chen Wangdao, Hu Juewen, and Liu Jingji; leading comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, Lieutenant General Rao Shoukun, Major General Liao Zhengguo, Senior Colonel Zhou Jianping, Zhang Chunqiao and Xie Bangzhi, members of the Council of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association in Shanghai, and people from all walks of life in Shanghai.

Also present at the banquet were Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Li Qiang, Chinese Ambassador to Cuba Shen Jian, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ge Buhai, and Deputy Director of the American and Australian Affairs Department Lin Ping.

Also invited to the banquet were Cuban Ambassador to China Oscar Pino Santos and First Secretary of the Embassy Cesinío Martínez Ortega.

After the banquet, the distinguished guests watched a cultural performance.

    古巴人民是不可战胜的
    上海市副市长刘述周欢宴古巴贵宾
    新华社上海27日电　上海市副市长刘述周今晚举行宴会，欢迎古巴国家银行行长埃·切·格瓦拉少校和他率领的古巴革命政府经济代表团的贵宾们。
    中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显和外交部副部长章汉夫出席了宴会。
    宴会在热烈友好的气氛中进行。宾主频频祝酒，为中国和古巴两国人民的战斗友谊，为古巴人民反对美帝国主义斗争的胜利而干杯。
    刘述周副市长在宴会上讲话。他代表上海市人民委员会和上海人民对以格瓦拉少校为首的古巴革命政府经济代表团光临上海访问，表示热烈的欢迎。他说，反对美帝国主义的共同斗争，早就使我们和古巴人民建立了战斗的友谊。我们以无限钦佩的心情关注着古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，我们愤怒地谴责美帝国主义对于古巴人民横加的经济封锁和武装威胁，我们将尽一切可能的力量坚决支持古巴人民的正义斗争。他说：我们坚信，美帝国主义对古巴的任何进犯必将遭到可耻的失败，已经觉醒和团结起来的古巴人民是不可战胜的。
    格瓦拉少校在宴会上讲话说，这次在中国的短短旅行中，我们曾经看到过巨大的桥梁，巨大的冶金企业，也看到过小的轴承厂和小的通过人民智慧创造出来的水力发电站。从这里，我们很清楚地了解到中国政府所规定的“两条腿走路”的方针的正确。
    他说，过去，我们只从书籍中知道一些上海的特点。那是帝国主义者和殖民主义者所造成的旧上海，而今天我们亲眼看到了新的上海。人们非常健康，充满精力，在建设社会主义中表现非常愉快。
    他谈到今天下午参观过的上海出口商品陈列厅。他说，从陈列的商品中，我们同样也看到上海的新的方面，这也是中国的新的方面。这可能看来是很小的东西，但它表明了社会主义已经在各个方面战胜了资本主义。
    格瓦拉少校热情地说，我们能作为第一个美洲国家和中国建立外交关系，感到非常光荣。但相信我们绝不是最后一个。为此，我建议为我们的友谊，干杯。
    今晚出席宴会的还有：上海市副市长宋日昌、宋季文、赵祖康，政协上海市委员会副主席陈望道、胡厥文、刘靖基，中国人民解放军驻上海部队首长饶守坤中将、廖政国少将、周建平大校，中国拉丁美洲友好协会在上海理事张春桥、谢邦治以及上海各方面人士。
    对外贸易部副部长李强、中国驻古巴大使申健、外交部礼宾司副司长葛步海、美澳司副司长林平也出席了宴会。
    应邀出席宴会的还有古巴驻中国大使奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯和大使馆一等秘书塞西尼奥·马丁内斯·奥尔特加。
