    Determined to Stay in the Countryside and Build a Home
    Xiuzhen, Commune Member of Zhangcun Commune, Pinglu County
    I am a young commune member from Zhangcun Commune, Pinglu County, Shanxi. In 1958, I married a county cadre. At the time, I thought, now I'll have connections to find a job, and I won't have to stay in the countryside anymore! Who knew that my husband not only didn't help, but instead advised me to focus on agricultural production and criticized me, saying, "If all the young people in the village were like you, going to the city to find jobs, who would work in agriculture?..." As soon as I heard this, I got angry. I said furiously, "Fine, family members don't care about family members. I just don't want to stay in the countryside. Even if I leave you, I'll find a job!" So, I stubbornly inquired everywhere, looking for job opportunities, unwilling to work hard in the countryside.

    After the Party Central Committee issued the call to the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, many cadres were sent down to work, and family members returned to the countryside to produce. In particular, the newspapers continuously introduced the model deeds of educated youth in building a new socialist countryside, which profoundly inspired and educated me, making me realize my erroneous thinking of looking down on labor and seeking pleasure. Now I understand that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and as long as agriculture develops, everything will be easy. I am determined to listen to the Party, concentrate on agricultural production, strive to build my hometown, and work with my husband in different work positions to jointly build our socialist society!

    决心留乡建家园
    平陆县张村公社社员　秀珍
    我是山西平陆县张村公社的一个青年社员。1958年我和一个县干部结了婚，当时我想，这下找工作可有门路了，再不用留在农村啦！谁知我爱人不但不帮忙，反劝我应该安心农业生产，并批评我说：“假如村里的青年人都像你这样，到城市去找工作，农业谁来搞？……”我一听就火了，我气愤地说：“好哇，一家人不管一家人，我就不愿意在农村，离了你我也要找工作！”于是赌气自己四出打听，寻找工作门路，不愿意在农村好好劳动。
    当党中央向全党全民发出大办农业、大办粮食的号召后，许多干部都下放劳动，家属返乡生产，特别是报纸上不断地介绍知识青年在建设社会主义新农村中的模范事迹，深刻地启发、教育了我，使我认识到自己轻视劳动，贪图享受的错误思想。我现在已经懂得了农业是国民经济的基础，只要农业发展了，啥事都好办啦。我决心听党的话，安心农业生产，努力建设自己的家乡，和我的爱人在不同的工作岗位上，共同建设咱们的社会主义社会！
