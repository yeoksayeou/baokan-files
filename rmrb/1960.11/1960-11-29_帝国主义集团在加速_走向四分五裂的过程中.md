The U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Under Secretary of State Dillon have concluded their trip to Western Europe. These two American ministers, burdened with the heavy responsibility of resolving the U.S. international payment crisis, encountered obstacles all along the way and returned to Washington in disgrace on the 27th. Western newspapers called Anderson and Dillon's mission a "failed" and "shameful" trip, but people can see more clearly from their experiences that Eisenhower's emergency measures will be difficult to implement; and more clearly see the dead end and contradictory reality of the capitalist world.

No matter how hard Washington tries to cover up the truth, everyone understands that Anderson and Dillon's journey to Western Europe was to beg Western European "allies" to help the United States, which is in the midst of a severe dollar crisis. That is, to ask Western European countries such as West Germany, France, and Britain to contribute money to alleviate the U.S. balance of payments deficit. Such a visit was already very dishonorable. Because the United States has always regarded itself as the great financier and great benefactor of the capitalist world, and the reactionary American newspapers often unceremoniously ridiculed Britain, France, West Germany and other Western European countries as "poor relatives" and "beggars." But now the United States has to humbly ask these "poor relatives" and "beggars" for help. And even more embarrassing is that these two American envoys were rebuffed in Bonn, Paris, and London. They were either flatly rejected, ignored, or politely declined. In short, they were unwilling to help. The New York Times complained: "The United States looks like it is holding a hat in front of the world begging for financial assistance but is being refused." This is the most vivid portrayal of the declining American imperialism.

It is not surprising that Anderson and Dillon were humiliated. What they said was asking "allies" to help the United States solve its immediate crisis, but in reality it was to shift the economic crisis facing the United States to them. As everyone knows, since the beginning of this year, the economic situation in the United States has been deteriorating, industrial production has been declining continuously, unemployment has been soaring, and recently a serious dollar crisis has occurred due to the gold rush. Eisenhower had no choice but to announce on the 16th of this month that he would take emergency measures to ease the deepening international balance of payments deficit and plug the gap in the outflow of gold. His main approach is actually to sacrifice the interests of others, requiring other capitalist countries to lower tariffs, lift import restrictions on American goods, and share the cost of American troops stationed overseas and "foreign aid" expenditures, and so on. Anderson and Dillon rushed to Western Europe to "persuade" the Western European "allies" of the United States to accept Eisenhower's plan to harm others and benefit himself. The most urgent thing was to ask their national banks to stop using U.S. dollars to redeem gold.

However, due to the increasing imbalance of capitalist development in recent years, the economic strength of Western European countries has relatively strengthened. For the United States, they are no longer so obedient. Moreover, today the economic and financial situations of Western European countries are also precarious. Britain is declining in both domestic economy and export trade. Inflation in France is developing seriously, and its finances are riddled with holes. West Germany's economy has also stagnated. At a time when these imperialist countries are all "clay Bodhisattvas crossing the river, unable to save themselves," how can the United States' attempt to sacrifice others to save itself not be resisted? According to Western news agencies, after West Germany and France flatly rejected the United States' unreasonable demands, Britain was unwilling to agree even to the minimum requirement of further lowering interest rates to help the United States stop the outflow of dollars, because Britain's own international balance of payments was also in crisis. Therefore, despite the fact that Western European countries are not without concern that the serious development of the U.S. economic crisis will eventually drag them into the vortex, they can only "do nothing to help."

Anderson and Dillon's cold reception in Britain and France was foreseeable. In recent times, Britain and France have been trying to strengthen their own positions by taking advantage of the weakening of American power. How can they be expected to help the United States out of its difficulties with a spirit of self-sacrifice? It would be good if they didn't kick them when they were down. It is said that the French government took the opportunity to threaten the United States to agree to let France share the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. On the one hand, Britain hypocritically expressed sympathy for the United States' situation, but in reality, it was calculating how to take advantage of this opportunity to gain more benefits: to please the United States and squeeze money out of West Germany, or to win over West Germany to confront the United States? And what made the United States most sad was West Germany's "ungratefulness." This Bonn group, which was established by the United States after the war and formed the Washington-Bonn axis with the United States, usually claimed to be the United States' "loyal and steadfast ally," but this time it stubbornly refused the United States' demands. In the talks, the West German government firmly refused to pay for the U.S. troop expenses, but only promised to contribute three to four billion marks more for so-called "assistance" to underdeveloped countries, with the aim of intensifying its infiltration into underdeveloped countries. West German Deputy Chancellor and Minister of Economic Affairs Erhard even openly said that West Germany "cannot sacrifice" the interests of taxpayers to "maintain the stability of the dollar." West Germany also raised the issue of returning the assets of former Hitler Germany to the United States. Due to West Germany's tough attitude, the joint communique of the two countries admitted that it was "not possible" to "reach a final conclusion with unanimous agreement" on all the measures that should be taken. Western political observers believe that this situation is "unprecedented" in the relationship between the United States and West Germany. Some West German newspapers even predicted that the relationship between the United States and West Germany may "experience unprecedented tension." If the intense contradictions within imperialism in the past were still more prominently concentrated between Britain and France on the one hand and Washington-Bonn on the other, and the relationship between the United States and West Germany could be relatively "calm," then now the rift between Washington and Bonn is also openly exposed. This shows that the position of West German monopoly capital in the capitalist world has been strengthened, and it has been trying to confront the United States in order to gradually get rid of the constraints of U.S. monopoly capital. This is a noteworthy new situation in the development of contradictions within the imperialist bloc.

The surfacing of the contradictions between the United States and Western European countries this time shows how fragile and false the so-called "unity" and "cooperation" of the imperialist bloc are. Having different dreams in the same bed and conflicts of interest are the essence of the relationship between imperialist countries. When disaster strikes, the contradictions and struggles between them are bound to become more acute and intense. This is something that no beautiful cloak of "unity" and "cooperation" can cover up.

Of course, the U.S. ruling clique will not give up because of Anderson and Dillon's setbacks. The Washington authorities will certainly rely on the certain advantages that the United States still maintains in the capitalist world and continue to use various means of harming others and benefiting themselves against its "allies" in order to achieve its selfish goals. The New York Herald Tribune said in a threatening tone, "The matter is far from over now." Anderson and Dillon's trip to Bonn was just "the beginning of a discussion, not the end." However, since this is a life-and-death struggle between imperialist countries, any pressure from the United States on other countries can only be met with fierce resistance, thereby exacerbating the contradictions within the imperialist bloc and accelerating the process of their disintegration.

    帝国主义集团在加速  走向四分五裂的过程中
    美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙已经结束了他们的西欧之行。这两位身负解救美国国际支付危机重任的美国部长碰了一路的钉子，已于27　日灰溜溜地回到了华盛顿。西方的报刊把安德逊和狄龙的这次出使称为“倒霉”和“丢脸”的旅行，而人们却可以从他们的遭遇中更清楚地看到艾森豪威尔的紧急措施将难有着落；更清楚地看到资本主义世界穷途末路和矛盾重重的现实。
    不管华盛顿方面如何竭力掩饰真相，谁都明白安德逊和狄龙所以仆仆于西欧之途，是为了要去乞求西欧的“盟国”对正在陷于严重的美元危机中的美国给予援手，就是说要求西德、法国和英国等西欧国家拿出钱来减轻美国的国际收支逆差。这样一次访问本来就是很不光采的。因为美国一向是以资本主义世界的大财主和大施主自居的，美国的反动报纸常常把英、法、西德等西欧国家毫不客气地揶揄为“穷亲戚”和“乞丐”。而美国现在却要低声下气地向这些“穷亲戚”和“乞丐”伸手求助了。而更难堪的是，这两位美国的特使不论在波恩、巴黎和伦敦都碰了一鼻子灰，对方或者是一口拒绝，或者是无动于中，或者是婉言推辞，总之是不肯帮忙。《纽约时报》满腹牢骚地说：“美国在世界面前给人看来活像手里拿着帽子去乞求财政救济却遭到拒绝。”这是美帝国主义日趋没落的最生动不过的写照。
    安德逊和狄龙的辱命是毫不奇怪的。他们说的是要求“盟国”帮助美国解救燃眉之急，实际上则是要向它们转嫁美国所面临的经济危机。大家知道，今年以来美国的经济情况即日趋恶化，工业生产连续下降，失业激增，而最近由于抢购黄金的风潮发生了严重的美元危机。艾森豪威尔不得不在本月16日宣布采取紧急措施以图缓和日益加深的国际收支逆差，堵塞黄金滚滚外流的缺口。他的主要做法实际上是以邻为壑，要求其他资本主义国家降低关税，取消美货入口限制，分担美国在海外的驻军费用和“援外”开支，等等。而安德逊和狄龙匆匆忙忙跑到西欧去，正是为了“说服”美国的西欧“盟国”接受艾森豪威尔损人利己的计划，最迫切的是要求它们的国家银行停止用美元挤兑黄金。
    但是，由于近年来资本主义发展不平衡的日益加剧西欧各国的经济力量已相对地加强，对美国来说，它们已经不再是那样听话的了。何况今天西欧国家的经济和财政状况，也处于风雨飘摇之中。英国无论在国内经济和出口贸易方面都在走下坡路。法国的通货膨胀正在严重发展，财政上又出现千疮百孔局面。西德的经济也已出现停滞状态。在这种帝国主义国家都正是“泥菩萨过江，自身难保”的时候，美国想牺牲别人挽救自己的企图，又怎能不遭到抗拒呢？据西方通讯社透露，在西德、法国断然拒绝了美国的无理要求之后，英国也连再降低一些利率来帮助美国制止美元外流这一最低要求，也不肯答应，因为英国自己的国际支付平衡也处在危急之中。因此，尽管西欧国家不无担心美国经济危机的严重发展最后也会把它们卷入漩涡，也只能“爱莫能助”了。
    安德逊和狄龙在英国和法国遭到冷遇是可以意料的。英法两国最近一个时期以来一直就力图利用美国力量的削弱加强自己的地位，怎能期望它们会以自我牺牲的精神来帮助美国解救它的困难呢？不落井下石就算好了。据说，法国政府就乘机要挟美国同意让法国分享北大西洋集团的领导权。而英国则一方面对美国的处境假惺惺地表示同情，但实际上则在盘算怎样利用这个机会多得一点好处：是讨好美国而挤出西德的钱来呢还是拉拢西德与美国抗衡？而最使美国感到伤心的是西德的“忘恩负义”。这个战后由美国一手扶植起来的、并同美国结成华盛顿—波恩轴心的波恩集团，平时口口声声自称美国的“忠实而坚定的盟国”，但是这一次却最顽强地拒绝了美国的要求。在会谈中，西德政府坚决拒绝支付美国的驻军费用，而只答应为所谓“援助”不发达国家多出三、四十亿马克，目的也只在于借此加紧渗入不发达国家。西德副总理兼经济部长艾哈德甚至公开说，西德“不能牺牲”纳税人利益来“保持美元稳定”。西德还向美国提出归还过去希特勒德国的资产问题。由于西德采取强硬的态度，两国的会谈公报承认，双方“没有可能”就全部应予采取的措施“获得一致的同意的最后结论”。西方政治观察家认为，这种情况在美国与西德关系中是“空前的”。一些西德报纸并且预言：美国西德关系可能“出现空前紧张局面”。如果说过去帝国主义内部激烈的矛盾还比较突出地集中在英法为一方，华盛顿—波恩为另一方之间，而美国和西德的关系还能比较“平静”的话，那末现在华盛顿和波恩之间的裂痕也公开显露出来了。这说明西德垄断资本在资本主义世界中的地位已经加强，它已经试图同美国相抗衡，以便逐步摆脱美国垄断资本的约束。这是帝国主义集团内部矛盾发展的一个值得注意的新情况。
    这次美国和西欧国家间的矛盾的表面化，显示出了帝国主义集团的所谓“团结”、“合作”是何等的脆弱和虚假。同床异梦和利害冲突原是帝国主义国家的关系的实质。到了大难临头之际，它们之间的矛盾和斗争就必然要更加尖锐和激烈。这是任何“团结”和“合作”的漂亮外衣都掩盖不住的。
    当然，美国统治集团并不会因为安德逊和狄龙的碰壁而就此罢休。华盛顿当局必将恃着美国在资本主义世界中仍然保持的一定的优势地位，继续对它的“盟国”施用各种损人利己的手段，以求达到其自私的目的。《纽约先驱论坛报》就以威胁的口吻说，“现在事情还远没有结束”，安德逊和狄龙的波恩之行只是“一个讨论的开始而不是结束”。但是，这既然是帝国主义国家之间的一场你死我活的斗争，美国对其他国家的任何压力，都只能遭到激烈的反抗，从而加剧帝国主义集团内部的矛盾，加速它们正在走向四分五裂的过程。
