Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th: According to a broadcast by the Lao Fighting Units radio station on the 17th, since the beginning of October, some reactionary military officers in Phongsaly Province, Laos, have forced soldiers to carry out large-scale "sweeps," persecuting the people, plundering their property, and constantly attacking the people's armed forces and the Lao Fighting Units. In order to protect the lives and property of the people, the people's armed forces and the Lao Fighting Units were forced to fight back in self-defense and have achieved many victories.

When these reactionary troops carried out "sweeps" in Muang Houn in early October, they were repelled twice by the people's armed forces. The people's armed forces killed twelve reactionary soldiers and wounded thirteen. On October 16th, another group of reactionary troops carried out "sweeps" and looting in Phongxaly District, and were attacked by the people's armed guerrillas. As a result, three rebel soldiers were killed and some were wounded. The guerrillas also recovered all the people's property that had been looted.

On November 5th, reactionary officer Heng ordered his subordinates to attack the people's armed forces in Phaxong. In the counterattack by the people's armed forces, three rebel soldiers were killed, nine were wounded, one surrendered, and one was captured. The people's armed forces also seized two light machine guns, a batch of 60mm mortar shells, and some important documents.

On November 9th, two reactionary military units, "CV-116" and "CV-113," attacked the Lao Fighting Units in the Lakham area and were met with a heroic counterattack. As a result, sixteen rebel soldiers were killed, two were captured, four surrendered, many were wounded, and the rest fled in disarray. In addition, the Lao Fighting Units also seized some weapons, military supplies, and other items.

Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee Spokesman Khamtay Issues Statement Condemning US Use of SEATO to Plot Armed Intervention in Laos. U.S. Imperialism and Its Lackeys Who Dare to Invade Laos by Armed Force Will Be Met With Resolute Counterattack.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 17th: The Lao Fighting Units radio station broadcast today that Khamtay Siphandone, spokesman for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, recently made a statement to reporters, condemning the conspiracy to interfere in Laos' internal affairs plotted at the military advisory meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in Bangkok on the 16th, under the control of the United States.

Khamtay pointed out that the inclusion of Laos affairs on the agenda of this treaty organization by U.S. imperialism and some of its vassal states is a violation of the basic principles of international law and a blatant trampling of Laos' sovereignty. As is well known, Laos is not a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and this organization has no reason to interfere in Laos' internal affairs.

Khamtay said that U.S. imperialism and its henchmen often mention that Laos is under the "protection" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, but as people know, this is a decision they made arbitrarily. The Lao people and the legitimate government know that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a military aggression organization founded by U.S. imperialism, which the United States uses to supervise its vassal states and invade other countries, thereby becoming a tool for suppressing and persecuting the national salvation movements of the people in Southeast Asia. The Lao legitimate government and all the Lao people resolutely follow the path of peace and neutrality, and resolutely do not accept the "protection" of any military organization.

Khamtay emphasized that the purpose of this meeting held by the U.S. aggressors and the lackeys of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is to intensify military intervention in Laos, help the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique to subvert the legitimate government, establish a dictatorial government, and use this as a tool to continue the civil war, suppress and persecute the Lao people, and undermine the path of peace, neutrality, and national reconciliation, thereby providing conditions for U.S. imperialism to turn Laos into a new type of colony and base for aggression. The above-mentioned conspiracy will not only bring serious disasters to Laos, but will also make the situation in Laos more difficult and complicated, and at the same time seriously threaten the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

When talking about the attitude of the Lao Patriotic Front towards the above-mentioned conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and the reactionary cliques of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Khamtay pointed out that the Lao Patriotic Front and all the Lao people unanimously believe that Laos is an independent country with full sovereignty, as specifically stipulated in the Geneva Agreements, and that Laos' sovereignty must be respected by all countries in accordance with the basic principles of international law. The Lao people will never allow any country or any military bloc to interfere in Laos' internal affairs. If U.S. imperialism and its henchmen violate international law and the various provisions of the Geneva Agreements, and dare to invade Laos by armed force in any form, then the Lao people will regard this action as an aggression against Laos, and will resolutely counterattack by means that the Lao people deem necessary. Khamtay pointed out that in the face of the above-mentioned dangerous disaster, the task of the Lao people is to raise their patriotic spirit, deeply hate the U.S. aggressors and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, unite the "Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unification," the Lao Patriotic Front, the Coup Committee, and all patriotic and peace-loving forces into a solid whole, rally around Prince Souvanna Phouma's legitimate government, resolutely direct the spearhead at the U.S. aggressors and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, and resolutely move towards the path of true peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

Khamtay said that the Lao people deeply know that the struggle for Laos' independence, sovereignty, and peaceful neutrality is a just struggle against the unjust conspiracies of U.S. imperialism, and is also a part of the struggle for peace, neutrality, democracy, and social progress for all mankind. Therefore, the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people firmly believe that the Lao struggle against the aggression conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its henchmen will increasingly receive the warm support of peaceful and neutral countries, Asian and African countries that uphold the Bandung spirit, and the participants of the Geneva Conference who are responsible for the Geneva Agreements.

    丰沙里人民武装和寮国战斗部队奋起自卫痛击反动军队
    新华社河内18日电　据寮国战斗部队电台17日广播，自10月初以来，老挝丰沙里省的一部分反动军官，强迫士兵大肆进行“扫荡”，迫害人民，掠夺人民的财物，并且不断进攻人民武装力量和寮国战斗部队。为了保护人民群众的生命财产，人民武装力量和寮国战斗部队被迫奋起自卫，并取得了许多胜利。
    这些反动军队10月初在芒昏进行“扫荡”的时候，曾两次被人民武装力量击退。人民武装力量打死了反动军十二人，打伤十三人。10月16日，另有一部分反动军队在丰赛县进行“扫荡”和抢劫，遭到人民武装游击队的袭击，结果三名叛军被打死，一部分叛军被打伤。游击队并把被他们抢走的人民的财产全部收回来。
    11月5日，反动军官恒命令他的部下向发宗的人民武装力量进攻，在人民武装力量的反击之下，三名叛军被打死，九名受伤，一名投降，一名被俘。人民武装力量还缴获两支轻机枪，一批六十公厘口径的迫击炮弹和一些重要文件。
    11月9日，“CV一一六”和“CV一一三”两个反动军队单位在腊探地区进攻寮国战斗部队，遭到寮国战斗部队英勇的反击。结果十六名叛军被打死，两名被俘，四名投降，很多人被打伤，其余的溃逃。此外，寮国战斗部队还缴获了一些武器、军用品等。老挝爱国战线党中央发言人坎代发表谈话斥美国利用东南亚集团策划武装干涉老挝美帝国主义及其走狗胆敢武装侵犯老挝必将遭到坚决反击
    新华社河内17日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人坎代·西班顿最近对新闻记者发表谈话，谴责在美国控制下的东南亚条约组织于16日在曼谷举行的军事顾问会议上策划干涉老挝内政的阴谋。
    坎代指出，美帝国主义及其一些仆从国家把老挝事务列入这个条约组织的讨论议程，是违反国际法基本原则和粗暴地蹂躏老挝主权的行为。如所周知，老挝并不是东南亚条约组织的成员国，这个组织毫无理由干涉老挝的内部事务。
    坎代说，美帝国主义及其走狗经常提到老挝是在东南亚条约组织的“保护”之下，但是如同人们所知道的，这是它们肆意决定的。老挝人民和合法政府知道，东南亚条约组织是由美帝国主义一手成立的军事侵略组织，而这个组织是美国用来监督其仆从国家、侵略其它国家，从而成为进行镇压和迫害东南亚地区人民的救国运动的工具。老挝合法政府和全体老挝人民坚决遵循和平中立路线，坚决不受任何军事组织的
  “保护”。
    坎代强调指出，美国侵略者及其东南亚条约组织的走狗举行这次会议的目的，是为了加紧对老挝进行军事干涉，帮助富米·诺萨万叛国集团颠复合法政府，成立独裁政府，并以此作为继续进行内战，镇压、迫害老挝人民，破坏和平中立、民族和睦路线的工具，从而为美帝国主义把老挝变成新型殖民地和侵略基地提供条件。上述阴谋将不仅给老挝带来严重祸害，而且会使老挝局势更加困难和复杂化，同时还严重地威胁着印度支那和东南亚地区的和平。
    坎代在谈到老挝爱国战线党对美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织反动集团的上述阴谋所持的态度时指出，老挝爱国战线党和全体老挝人民一致认为，如日内瓦协议所具体规定的那样，老挝是一个具有充分主权的独立国家，按照国际法的基本原则，老挝主权必须获得一切国家的尊重。老挝人民绝不容许任何一国和任何军事集团干涉老挝内部事务。如果美帝国主义及其走狗违反国际法和日内瓦协议各项条款，胆敢在任何形式下把武装力量侵入老挝，那么，老挝人民就把这种行动看作是对老挝的侵略，并坚决用老挝人民认为所必须的手段进行反击。坎代指出，面临上述危险的灾祸，老挝人民的任务是，必须提高爱国精神，深切仇恨美国侵略者和富米·诺萨万卖国集团，把“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”、老挝爱国战线党和政变委员会以及一切爱国、爱和平的力量集合成一个坚固的整体，围绕在富马亲王合法政府的周围，坚决把矛头指向美国侵略者和富米·诺萨万叛国集团，坚决走向真正的和平中立、民族和睦的道路。
    坎代说，老挝人民深知，为老挝的独立、主权和和平中立的斗争，是反对美帝国主义非正义的阴谋的正义斗争，同时也是争取和平中立、民主和全人类社会进步的斗争的一部分。因此，老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民深信，老挝反对美帝国主义及其走狗侵略阴谋的斗争，将越来越得到和平中立国家、奉行万隆精神的亚非各国以及对日内瓦协议负有责任的日内瓦会议参加国的热烈支持。
