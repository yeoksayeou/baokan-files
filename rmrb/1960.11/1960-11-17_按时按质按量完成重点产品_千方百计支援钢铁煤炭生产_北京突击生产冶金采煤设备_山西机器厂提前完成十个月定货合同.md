Xinhua News Agency, November 16th: Beijing's machinery and electrical industries are doing everything possible to deliver key products to users in accordance with state contract regulations, in order to support iron, steel, and coal production.

This year, Beijing's machinery and electrical manufacturing sectors are responsible for a large number of orders from iron and steel and coal mining enterprises, including more than 20 types of products such as mine cars, crushers, coking equipment, hoisting machinery, and industrial boilers. After entering the fourth quarter, the Beijing Machinery and Electrical Industry Bureaus organized specialized teams and worked with relevant factories to check the completion of each order and formulate production plans and measures to complete them. The Beijing Planning Commission, relevant industry bureaus, and factories, in the spirit of prioritizing external needs over internal needs, and ensuring state orders first, organized specialized teams to strengthen the transportation of materials allocated by the state; at the same time, they unified and concentrated the use of existing materials. The Machinery Industry Bureau solved the supply of metal materials through internal and external adjustments. The Electrical Industry Bureau also modified a batch of existing steel into angle steel to meet the needs of state-ordered products.

The Beijing Machinery and Electrical Industry Bureaus also took measures from all aspects to increase the manufacturing capacity of state-ordered products. New mine cars are now being produced and sent to users every day. Beijing's railway and highway transportation departments are also working closely with the production departments to transport the raw materials needed for state-ordered products and the products that have been produced in a timely manner.

At present, all relevant factories in the city are using concentrated efforts to produce metallurgical and coal mining equipment. The Beijing Motor Factory postponed the production of non-state planned products and concentrated its efforts on producing motors. In the first fourteen days of November, it produced 126 motors, a twofold increase compared with the same period last month. The Beijing Metal Structure Factory, which produces mine cars, formed a large production line from casting to finished product inspection and painting. Leading cadres go to the site day and night to direct production. The factory broke the usual practice of only producing finished products in the latter half of each month. From November 5th, finished products have been leaving the factory every day. More than 280 mine cars have now been shipped to coal mines in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 16th: Under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as a chessboard," the Shanxi Machine Factory completed its product order contracts for the first ten months on schedule or ahead of schedule. The factory has completed 898 sets of the 1,121 sets of 13 key products it is responsible for this year, exceeding the original plan for January-October by 11.4%. Among these key products, except for two items that were postponed due to design modifications required by the state, the remaining 11 key products were delivered according to the contract, and six of them were delivered one to three months ahead of the contract time. At present, all employees of the factory are striving to complete the last batch of complete product tasks for this year ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

The main tasks undertaken by this factory are the manufacture of metallurgical equipment, mining machinery, and agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery. Among them, key products such as coke oven door frames, crushers, and coal washing machines are supplied to enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, Anshan Iron and Steel, and Benxi Iron and Steel. Therefore, whether the delivery can be made on time, in the correct variety, and as a complete set has a major impact on the country's steel and coal production. The factory's Party committee informed the workers of the situation and tasks, so that every worker in the factory knows where these key products are used, when they are delivered, and their relationship to the increase production and practice economy campaign centered on grain and steel.

The factory has also implemented the principles of prioritizing the central government over local governments, and prioritizing key tasks over general tasks in terms of planning management and raw material supply. When preparing plans, they put key products at the forefront and pay attention to the complete sets of main engines, auxiliary engines, accessories, and tools of these key products, and actively contact the users to make the plan more in line with actual requirements. For example, at the beginning of this year, the contract ordered by Xuanhua Iron and Steel Plant from this factory stipulated that 70 sets of coke oven door frames should be delivered at the end of the first quarter. After the planning personnel of this factory visited Xuanhua Iron and Steel Plant, they found that the civil construction project of the coke oven of this plant was completed in the fourth quarter of last year, and the furnace door frame can be put into production as soon as it arrives. Therefore, they immediately revised the plan and delivered all the furnace door frames in January, which won time for the coke oven of Xuanhua Iron and Steel Plant to be put into production.

Since August, when the factory's Party committee conducted a item-by-item assessment of the production progress of key products for the whole year, it found that the factory's processing capacity could not meet the needs of producing large spare parts for key enterprises, and the production scheduling was not flexible. The Party committee secretary, factory director, chairman of the trade union, and engineers all went to the workshop to organize workers to solve weak links one by one. They strengthened the scheduling work with product completion as the center. The factory headquarters held three operation meetings a week to check progress in a timely manner, adjust plans, equipment, and manpower to ensure the production of complete sets of parts, avoiding the phenomenon that the entire set of products could not be shipped on schedule due to individual missing parts.

    按时按质按量完成重点产品
    千方百计支援钢铁煤炭生产
    北京突击生产冶金采煤设备　山西机器厂提前完成十个月定货合同
    据新华社16日讯　北京市机械、电机工业部门，正千方百计按国家合同规定，把重点产品交给使用单位，支援钢铁煤炭生产。
    北京机械和电机制造部门，今年担负着很多钢铁煤矿企业的订货任务，其中有矿车、破碎机、焦化设备、起重机械、工业锅炉等二十多种。进入第四季度以后，北京市机械和电机两个工业局，都组织专门力量和各有关工厂一起，分别检查每项订货任务完成的情况，并订出了生产计划和完成计划的措施。北京市计委、各有关工业局和工厂，根据先外后内、首先保证国家订货产品的精神，组织专门力量，加强对国家调拨材料的调运工作；同时，将现有材料统一集中使用。机械工业局通过内外调剂等办法，解决了金属材料的供应。电机工业局也将现有的一批钢，改制成角钢，供应国家订货产品的需要。
    北京市机械和电机两个工业局，还从各方面采取措施，来增加国家订货产品的制造能力，现在每天都有新生产出的矿车发往使用单位。北京市的铁路、公路运输部门，也和生产部门密切配合，及时运送国家订货产品所需要的原材料和生产出来的产品。
    目前，全市各个有关工厂，也用突击力量生产冶金、采煤设备。北京市电机厂将非国家计划产品推后生产，集中力量生产电动机，11月前十四天，就生产出电动机一百二十六台，比上月同期提高了两倍。生产矿车的北京市金属结构厂，从铸件到成品检验、喷漆等各个工序间，组成了一条生产大流水线，领导干部日夜深入现场指挥，全厂打破了每月下旬才出成品的常规，从11月5日开始每天都有成品出厂，现已有二百八十多辆矿车分别运往东北和内蒙古的煤矿。
    据新华社太原16日电　山西机器厂在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下，按期或提前完成了头十个月的产品定货合同。全厂今年担负的十三项一千一百二十一台（套）重点产品的制造任务，已完成八百九十八台（套），超过1至10月份原订计划11.4％。在这些重点产品中，除开两项因为按国家要求修改设计而推后交货以外，其余十一项重点产品都照合同交货，其中有六项比合同规定时间提前一至三个月。目前，全厂职工正争取提前和超额完成今年最后一批产品成套的任务。
    这个厂担负的主要任务是制造冶金设备、矿山机械和农业排灌机械。其中如焦炉炉门框、破碎机、洗煤机等重点产品，都是供给武钢、包钢、鞍钢、本溪钢铁公司等企业用的。因此，能否按合同规定的时间、品种，成套交货，对全国的钢、煤生产有重大影响。厂党委通过向职工交形势、交任务，使全厂每个职工都知道这些重点产品，用在哪里，何时交货，以及对以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动的关系。
    这个厂在计划管理、原材料供应上，也都贯彻了先中央后地方，先重点后一般的原则。他们在编制计划时，都把重点产品排在最前边，并注意这些重点产品的主机、副机、配件、工具的成套，而且主动和使用单位联系，使计划更符合于实际要求。如今年年初，宣化钢铁厂向这个厂订货的合同，规定于一季末交七十台（套）焦炉炉门框。这个厂的计划人员到宣化钢铁厂登门拜访后，发现这个厂焦炉土建工程已于去年四季度竣工，炉门框一到就可投入生产。于是就立即修订计划，把这批炉门框提前在1月份全部交货，为宣化钢铁厂焦炉投入生产争取了时间。
    8月份以来，这个厂的厂党委对全年重点产品生产进度逐项摸底时，发现本厂的加工能力不能适应为重点企业生产大型备件的需要，生产调度不灵等问题后，党委书记、厂长、工会主席、工程师就都到车间，组织职工一个一个地解决薄弱环节。他们以产品成套为中心，加强了调度工作。厂部每周开三次作业会议，及时检查进度，调整计划、设备、人力，做到成套的生产部件，避免了因个别缺件而造成整套产品不能按期出厂的现象。（附图片）
