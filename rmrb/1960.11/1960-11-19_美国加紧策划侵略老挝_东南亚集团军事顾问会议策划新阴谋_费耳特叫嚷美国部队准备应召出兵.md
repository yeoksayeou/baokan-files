Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Bangkok: U.S. Pacific Area Armed Forces Commander Felt today in Bangkok arrogantly clamored: "My Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps will not withdraw from the Western Pacific and Far East waters." He said: these U.S. forces are all "ready to be called" to send troops.

Felt made this clamor at the opening ceremony of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military advisors' conference. At the meeting, he as usual issued a series of shameless anti-communist slanders regarding the situations in Laos and Vietnam.

Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Nai Thanom, in his opening remarks to the conference, once again expressed the attitude of the Thai Sarit reactionary ruling clique openly following U.S. imperialism in interfering in Laos. He said: "If the shocking events occurring in Laos continue to spread, the Thai armed forces will be prepared to do their utmost, to take swift action, to fulfill the decisions of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and Thailand's obligations to the organization."

The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military advisors' conference is specially established for plotting aggression conspiracies and military deployments. This meeting is being held amidst the intensifying U.S. imperialist interference in Laos. All countries participating in this U.S.-controlled aggressive bloc have sent senior generals to participate in this meeting. According to pre-meeting revelations, this meeting will put the planning of interference in Laos at the forefront of the agenda, and will also discuss the situation in South Vietnam.

    东南亚集团军事顾问会议策划新阴谋
    费耳特叫嚷美国部队准备应召出兵
    据新华社16日讯　曼谷消息：美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特今天在曼谷狂妄地叫嚣：“我的海军、陆军、空军和海军陆战队不会从西太平洋和远东海域撤退”。他说：美国的这些部队都“准备应召”出兵。
    费耳特是在东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议的开幕式上发出这一叫嚣的。他在会上照例就老挝和越南局势发出了一番反共的无耻谰调。
    泰国副总理兼国防部长乃他侬在向会议致开幕词时，又一次表示了泰国乃沙立反动统治集团公开追随美帝国主义干涉老挝的态度。他说：“如果在老挝发生的惊人事件继续蔓延，泰国的武装部队将准备尽最大的力量，采取迅速的行动，来履行东南亚条约组织的决定和泰国对这个组织的义务。”
    东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议是专为策划侵略阴谋和军事部署而设的。这次会议正在美帝国主义加紧干涉老挝的情况下举行。所有参加这个美国控制的侵略集团的国家都派有高级将领参加这次会议。据会前透露，这次会议将把策划干涉老挝放在议程的首要地位，也将讨论越南南方的局势。
