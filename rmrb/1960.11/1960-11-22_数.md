    Numbers
    Tang Gao
    Having numbers in mind is very important. Cadres go deep into the front lines of production with great enthusiasm. They immerse themselves in a production task and get to work. However, without numbers, it is impossible to carry out leadership work well.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Having numbers in mind. This means that one must pay attention to the quantitative aspect of situations and problems and have a basic quantitative analysis. Any quality is expressed as a certain quantity; without quantity, there is no quality." This shows the importance of numbers. The quality of any work is expressed by a certain quantity. When planting wheat, how many acres to plant, how much seed to use, how much labor to allocate, how many days to complete, and whether the planting is good or not – without quantity, one will be at a loss. Any quantity in work expresses a certain quality. Behind the quantity, there are situations, problems, near-term prospects, long-term visions, and clearly outlined battle maps for analysis, decision-making, and command.
    At first glance, numbers lack concrete images and are relatively dry. Some comrades do not pay much attention to numbers, do not understand basic quantitative analysis, and cannot find quantitative boundaries for specific things in their work, only relying on vague impressions to handle things. In this way, the analysis will not be precise, and the decisions will not be accurate. In grassroots work, which aspect does not have a quantitative boundary? Take planting vegetables as an example! The old rule was one tael of vegetable seeds per mu. A county Party secretary heard everyone saying that there were not enough vegetable seeds. He weighed one tael of vegetable seeds and counted them: some had more than 12,000 seeds, and some had fewer than 8,000 seeds. However, only a few hundred to a thousand vegetable plants grew per mu, how many vegetable seeds were wasted! Originally, the old rule was one tael of vegetable seeds per mu; now, it has been changed to one or two taels per five mu, and there are enough vegetable seeds, and the task has been overfulfilled. After the vegetable seedlings emerged, there was still a surplus of plants. This can only be achieved by having numbers in mind. How many seeds are there in one tael of vegetable seeds? This is a matter of common sense. However, it is essential to understand this common sense when necessary. With this number, it can be used as a key to unlock the problem. With numbers, one can avoid a presumptuous style; with numbers, one can overcome a conceptualized approach. Counting vegetable seeds can certainly be considered a "small matter"; however, in any grassroots leadership work, for the leadership work of a production team, a commune, or a county, one must have the spirit of counting vegetable seeds and not underestimate this number, and not make decisions subjectively without a basis.
    However, where do numbers come from? They come from seeing, listening, and asking, that is, from doing in-depth and arduous investigation and research work. Without investigation and research, speeches will not be pertinent. Investigation and research cannot rely solely on seeing, listening, and asking; sometimes one cannot see, hear, or ask. In this case, one must get to work. Working is a good method of investigation and research. For example, counting vegetable seeds is a good method. Many people also know the benefits of counting vegetable seeds, but some people hesitate at this point: should I count them? Why bother? One vegetable seed does not even weigh a few li, hao, or si, or a fraction thereof, what's the use of counting it? Little do they know that without counting it, without analyzing it, without having numbers in mind, the work will not be done well and will cause big trouble; by counting it and analyzing it, having numbers in mind, the work will be easier and will save big trouble. Comparing the two, the choice is naturally clear. Cadres who go deep into the front lines must have the spirit of counting vegetable seeds when encountering problems. However, it should be said that "the masses are sages"; one cadre's knowledge is limited, and his thinking is not comprehensive. He cannot spend all day counting vegetable seeds and ignore everything else. Therefore, while working, one must also trust and rely on grassroots cadres and the broad masses, and turn the numbers in their minds into the numbers in one's own mind.

    数

    胸中有数，十分重要。干部深入了生产第一线，干劲很高。他们钻到一项生产上去，就干了起来。但是，如果没有数，就不能很好地进行领导工作。
    毛泽东同志说，“胸中有数。这是说，对情况和问题一定要注意到它们的数量方面，要有基本的数量的分析。任何质量都表现为一定的数量，没有数量也就没有质量。”由此可见数之重要。任何工作好坏都由一定的数量表示出来。种麦子要种多少亩，要种多少种子，要多少劳动力，要几天完成，种得好不好，离开了数量，就会茫然无措。工作中的任何数量都表现为一定的质量。在数量的背后，有情况，有问题，有近景，有远景，有轮廓鲜明的作战图，可供分析，可供决策，可供指挥。
    乍看起来，数字没有具体形象，是比较枯燥的。有的同志就不大关心数，不懂得基本的数量分析，对于工作中的具体事物找不出数量界限，只凭朦胧的印象办事。这样，分析不会精微，决策不会准确。基层工作中，哪一样没有个数量界限呢？就种菜来说吧！老规矩一两菜籽种一亩。一个县委书记听见大家都说菜籽不够。他就称一两菜籽数了一下，多的一万二千多粒，少的八千多粒。可是，一亩地只长上几百到千把棵菜，有多少菜籽浪费掉了！原来老规矩，一两菜籽种一亩，现在改成一两种五亩，菜籽就够了，任务超额完成了。菜籽出了以后，棵子还有富裕。这就是胸中有数，才能办得到。一两菜籽有多少粒？是个常识问题。可是，在必要的时候，非懂得这个常识不可。有了这个数，才能把它当作钥匙。去开问题的锁。有了数，可以避免想当然的作风；有了数，可以克服概念化的做法。数菜籽当然可以说是一件“小事”；可是，在任何基层领导工作中，对于一个生产队，一个公社，一个县的领导工作，都必须要有数菜籽的精神，不能小看这个数，不能无根据地、主观地决定问题。
    然而，数从何来？要靠看，要靠听，要靠问，也就是说，要做深入艰苦的调查研究工作。没有调查研究，发言不会中肯。调查研究，又不能光靠看、听、问，有时候会看不出，听不到，问不出。在这种情况下，就要动手去干。干，就是调查研究的一种好方法。比如说，数菜籽，就是一种好方法。很多人也知道数菜籽的好处，可是，有的人会在这一点上踌躇起来：数不数呢？干吗要去麻烦一下呢？一粒菜籽也不知重有几厘、几毫、几丝的几分之几，数它有什么用场？殊不知，不数它，不分析，胸中无数，工作做不好，惹大麻烦；数了它，又分析，胸中有数，工作好做了，省大麻烦。两两相较，何去何从，自然分晓。深入第一线的干部，碰到问题，必须要有数菜籽的精神。可是，话又说回来了，“众人是圣人”，一个干部见闻有限，思虑难周，总不能一天到晚都去数菜籽，丢下别的不管。所以，在干的同时，还要相信并依靠基层干部和广大群众，把他们胸中的数，变成自己胸中的数。
