This newspaper's Baotou dispatch on the 11th: In order to increase coke production and save coking coal, the Baotou Steel and Iron Works Coking Plant started by strengthening production management, appropriately reduced the ratio of coking coal in the coal blend, and used more inferior coal such as lean coal and lignite to produce high-quality coke. In October, the plant saved the country more than 30,000 tons of coking coal.

In order to save coking coal, the Party committee of the plant proposed to all employees the call to reduce the proportion of coking coal in the blending and use more inferior coal to produce high-quality coke. Then, a vigorous mass movement to save coking coal was launched throughout the plant. Fire adjustment is the central link in coking. Bian Ting, the Party secretary and plant director, went deep into the front of the furnace and held "three-in-one" meetings to study and discuss how to improve and strengthen fire adjustment work. After several studies, it was found that increasing the temperature in the middle of the combustion chamber and the temperature of the furnace heads on both sides of the coke oven was the central link in saving coking coal. After finding this key, the Party branch of the coking workshop further held "three-in-one" meetings of the fire adjustment section to mobilize the masses to find the reasons and think of solutions. The workers believed that the low temperature in the middle of the combustion chamber was due to the small burner and the small flow of gas. The plant Party committee immediately organized the relevant workshops to replace them. In order to maintain the furnace head temperature, Deng Kai, the leader of the fire adjustment team, and Hao Desheng, a fire adjustment worker, made their own efforts to line a thin iron plate on the pressure measuring hole cover, blocking the cold air, and the furnace head temperature immediately improved significantly. After overcoming these key points, the furnace temperature rose rapidly, and the raw coke phenomenon was completely eliminated, ensuring the quality of the coke.

To use more inferior coal to produce high-quality coke, it is also necessary to establish a normal production order and ensure on-time coke pushing. To this end, the three shifts of operators worked together to basically eliminate operational accidents and ensure the normal operation of mechanical and electrical equipment. With the close collaboration of all links, the coking time was quickly unified, and on-time coke pushing was achieved.

Due to the improved operation, a large amount of coking coal was saved and the quality of coke was guaranteed. The strength of coke in mid-October increased by an average of 9 kilograms compared to the beginning of the month, and increased by 3 kilograms in the last ten days of the month compared to the middle ten days of the month, ensuring the needs of the blast furnace for metallurgical coke.

    包钢焦化厂用次煤炼好焦
    十月份节约焦煤三万多吨
    本报包头11日电　包钢焦化厂为了增产焦炭节约焦煤，从加强生产管理着手，适当降低焦煤的配煤比例，多用瘦煤、褐煤等次煤炼出了好焦炭，10月份给国家节约焦煤三万多吨。
    为了节约焦煤，这个厂的党委曾向全体职工提出了降低焦煤配煤比例，多用次煤炼好焦的号召。接着一个轰轰烈烈的节约焦煤的群众运动就在全厂开展起来了。调火工作是炼焦的中心环节，党委书记兼厂长边亭深入炉前，召开“三结合”会议，研究和讨论如何改进和加强调火工作。经过多次研究，发现提高燃烧室中部温度和焦炉两侧的炉头温度，是节约焦煤的中心环节。找到这一关键后，炼焦车间党支部又进一步召开调火工段的“三结合”会议，发动群众找原因，想办法。工人们认为燃烧室中部温度低，是因为烧咀小，煤气流量小。厂党委马上组织有关车间进行掉换。为了保持炉头温度，调火组长邓开和调火工人郝德生自己动手，在测压孔盖上衬了一层薄铁板，挡住了冷空气，炉头温度立即有了显著的提高。攻克这些关键后，炉温迅速上升，并彻底消灭了生焦现象，保证了焦炭质量。
    要多用次煤炼好焦，还必须相应地建立正常的生产秩序，保证正点推焦。为此三班操作工人同心协力，基本上消灭了操作事故，保证了机电设备的正常运转。在各个环节的紧密协作下，很快统一了结焦时间，做到了正点推焦。
    由于改进了操作，既节约了大量焦煤，又保证了焦炭质量。焦炭强度，10月中旬比上旬平均提高九公斤，下旬又比中旬提高三公斤，保证了大高炉对冶金焦的需要。
