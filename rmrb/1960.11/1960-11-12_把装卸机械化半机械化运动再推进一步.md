Why, when manually loading and unloading goods, do some people carry them on their backs, some use shoulder poles, and others lift them, instead of using the same method of operation? This is because the goods being loaded and unloaded vary in size and weight, and there are differences between bulk and packaged goods, and between solids and liquids; also, because the loading and unloading process is continuous. For example, ship loading and unloading generally involves six stages: opening the hold, leveling, stacking, feeding, climbing slopes, and loading and unloading vehicles. Therefore, a variety of methods must be adopted to adapt to the characteristics of loading and unloading operations. According to the same principle, in the movement of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading, the creation, manufacture, and application of loading and unloading tools must better adapt to the characteristics of loading and unloading operations. Only by using a variety of more complete tools to replace the various manual handling and loading and unloading methods can the reformed tools exert their full effectiveness. This is what we usually call "forming a complete set," and its purpose is to move from single innovations to a series of innovations, further improving the labor productivity of handling and loading and unloading.

Marx said in "Das Kapital": "Labor productivity depends not only on how skilled the laborer is, but also on how complete the tools he uses are." (Das Kapital, Volume 1, page 409) This means that improving labor productivity relies on people and tools, and tools must be gradually improved. However, many tools are often incomplete when they are first created and often cannot clearly demonstrate their superiority in improving labor productivity. This is a contradiction. Such a contradiction occurred at the West Freight Yard of Tianjin Railway Station. The West Freight Yard launched a mechanization and semi-mechanization movement for loading and unloading in December last year. In a few days, a large number of loading and unloading tools were created. These tools greatly improved the efficiency of certain single operations, but the overall loading and unloading efficiency declined, and the time vehicles stayed at the yard did not shorten. The superiority of technological revolution was not demonstrated. Why did this happen? From the perspective of the tools themselves, the main reason was that their quality was not complete enough. For example, some tools were not easy to use or convenient, and the time spent moving them was often longer than the pure operation time; and tools had not been created to replace manual operations in some operational stages. This means that the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement of loading and unloading had not fully adapted to the diverse and highly continuous characteristics of handling and loading and unloading operations, and the new things were still in a low-level stage. Therefore, the goal of improving the overall loading and unloading efficiency was not achieved. How to overcome this contradiction? Should we overcome the difficulties with hard work and perseverance, and make the new things move from incompleteness to completeness, and achieve the goal of improving labor productivity? Or should we simply give up and load and unload in the old way? At that time, some cadres at the West Freight Yard chose the second path, which was to bow to difficulties. They were afraid that using new tools would be inefficient and they would not be able to complete their tasks. When loading and unloading tasks were heavy, they still resorted to increasing the number of people. However, the Party branch of the West Freight Yard insisted on taking the first path, which was a path of advancing forward in the face of difficulties. They relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, were not afraid of hardship, and actively improved the existing innovative tools to make them more complete. They also created new tools to fill the gaps and make the new tools "form a complete set" and give full play to their effectiveness. As a result, the goal was achieved: the labor productivity of workers was greatly improved, the time freight cars stayed at the yard was shortened by 39% compared to the beginning of the year, and 45% of the loading and unloading workers were also saved.

This is a very persuasive example. It tells us that we must never give up halfway when doing anything. The mechanization and semi-mechanization movement of loading and unloading is a revolutionary movement. Since it is a revolution, there will always be difficulties, and even more complex problems will often arise later, requiring a great deal of effort to solve. This is also the inevitable law of the development of things from low to high. However, as long as we are determined to carry the revolution through to the end, adhere to the mass line, and work in a thorough and meticulous manner, we will definitely achieve the expected goal. Overcoming difficulties means achieving success; overcoming greater difficulties means achieving greater success. The development of the loading and unloading technology revolution from a low-level stage to a high-level stage, that is, from an incomplete stage to a complete stage, requires more detailed and complex work. Innovative tools must be sorted, appraised, selected, and standardized one by one. Various tools must be matched to form a complete set, so that major tools and auxiliary tools, large tools and small tools, mechanized tools and semi-mechanized tools adapt to each other. The weak links and "difficulties" that still rely on manual operation must be broken through one by one. Enterprise management and labor organization need to be improved and adjusted under the new conditions. All of this is expected. The problem is whether our comrades, especially those doing leadership work, have a thorough understanding of the situation and whether they have a strong and thorough revolutionary spirit. Since the launch of the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement for loading and unloading, the backward state of handling and loading and unloading work has greatly changed, but it has not fundamentally changed, and the transportation and loading and unloading tasks are continuing to grow rapidly with the development of production. On a national scale, handling and loading and unloading operations are still lagging behind the leaping situation of production and transportation, and have become an important key to whether transportation efficiency can be greatly improved. The continuous leaping situation of industrial and agricultural production requires accelerating the circulation of materials and improving handling and loading and unloading efficiency; the transportation methods of modern large-scale production require rapidly changing the old loading and unloading production methods of carrying on shoulders and lifting by hand; and the labor arrangement of the entire country requires saving loading and unloading workers, and, as far as possible, not temporarily mobilizing a large number of social laborers for crash jobs. These are all requirements put forward by the objective situation. How can these requirements be met? There is only one way, and that is to continue to deepen the technical revolution in handling and loading and unloading. Just like in battle, after breaking through the breakthrough point, we must immediately conquer the enemy's fortresses and finally annihilate the enemy, the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement of loading and unloading in many units is in such a situation. The situation is very good. Of course, to "annihilate the enemy," we must concentrate our forces and carry out a series of arduous and meticulous work. For example, to make loading and unloading tools form a complete set, we must conduct a comprehensive investigation and research on the characteristics of loading and unloading operations, and have a deep understanding of the upper and lower processes and the situation before and after. We must mobilize the masses to repeatedly study and improve the existing innovative tools, turning inferiority into superiority, and clumsiness into ingenuity. We must conduct a serious analysis of the "difficulties" that have not yet been broken and take practical measures to mobilize the masses to solve them one by one. If these tasks are done carefully one by one, just like when water flows, a channel is formed, the problem will definitely be solved.

Many facts prove that with a strong and thorough revolutionary spirit, and by doing a good job of mobilizing the masses and giving full play to the wisdom and strength of the masses, and conscientiously implementing the policy of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and combining indigenous and foreign methods, it is possible to achieve the transition of loading and unloading tools from incompleteness to a certain degree of completeness. Taking the more difficult hold operations as an example, workers in Shanghai Port have created a relatively complete set of loading and unloading tools according to the characteristics of different goods. If the hold is filled with bulk goods such as coal and ore, the workers use a grab bucket made by the collective to enter the hold. As long as two people operate it, it can grab more than two tons of coal or ore at a time, and the amount of loading and unloading in one day is equal to the amount of more than sixty workers loading and unloading manually at the same time. If the hold is filled with small miscellaneous goods of varying sizes, a "receiving box" is used. After the goods are loaded into the box, the box is placed on the ship, and the box is unloaded when unloading, which improves efficiency by more than one time. If it is a larger miscellaneous goods, a disc with sixteen hooks is used to connect the winch. The workers only need to put the hooks on the goods, and they can unload more than two tons at a time. If you want to unload grain bags in the hold, you can extend the wooden strip conveyor or belt conveyor into the hold, and the bags of grain can be quickly sent to the deck. Workers at Shanghai Port have also connected the machinery between the various processes to realize the systematic innovation of loading and unloading tools, and carry out continuous operations from the ship's hold to the warehouse using mechanized and semi-mechanized tools. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The masses have great creativity. Among the Chinese people, there are really tens of thousands of 'Zhuge Liang,' and every village and every town has its 'Zhuge Liang.'" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 3, page 936) This is indeed the case. Like the creativity of the workers in Shanghai Port, like the "Zhuge Liang" among the workers in Shanghai Port, which port, station, and freight yard does not have them? Relying on the great creativity of the people, what difficulties cannot be overcome?

In the first half of this year, railway stations and port terminals across the country launched an unprecedentedly large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization movement for handling and loading and unloading. The masses themselves designed and manufactured many loading and unloading tools. For example, simple and easy-to-use sliding tools have been promoted in many places, effectively improving loading and unloading efficiency. In the second half of the year, the movement entered the stage of consolidation, promotion, and improvement, which made a large number of innovative tools from incomplete to complete. The current key is to develop from the improvement of single or partial machines to the direction of matching to form a complete set and even the entire process of mechanized continuous operation, which must not only ensure the improvement of handling and loading and unloading efficiency, but also ensure the integrity of the goods. The requirements are getting higher and higher, and the tasks are getting heavier and heavier. However, after a year of technological innovation, all parts of the country have a lot of loading and unloading machinery, accumulated a lot of experience, and the technical level of workers has also been greatly improved. As long as we add more effort on this basis, do every job carefully and meticulously, and mobilize the broad masses well, the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement of loading and unloading will definitely advance further, and promote the comprehensive and substantial improvement of loading and unloading efficiency.

### 把装卸机械化半机械化运动再推进一步

    把装卸机械化半机械化运动再推进一步
    为什么在人工装卸货物时，有的要背、有的要挑、有的要抬，而不是用同一种方法操作呢？这是因为装卸的货物有大小、轻重之分，有散装、整装之别，有固体、液体的不同；同时也因为装卸的过程是连续性的，如船舶装卸，一般要经过起舱、平舱、码垛、供料、爬坡、装卸车等六个环节。所以要采用多种多样的方法，以适应装卸作业的特点。根据同样的道理，在装卸的机械化半机械化运动中，也必须使装卸工具的创造、制造和应用，更好地适应装卸作业的特点，用多种多样的、更完备的工具，来代替人工操作的各种搬运、装卸方法，才能使已改革的工具发挥充分效能。这也就是我们通常所说的“配套成龙”，其目的是从单项的革新，进到系列的革新，进一步提高搬运装卸的劳动生产率。
    马克思在“资本论”里说：“劳动生产率不仅依存于劳动者如何熟练，且也依存于他所使用的工具如何完备。”（资本论第一卷409页）这就是说，提高劳动生产率，是依靠人和工具来实现的，而工具又必须是逐步完备的。可是，很多工具在刚刚创造的时候，又往往是不完备的，往往不能明显地表现出它提高劳动生产率的优越性。这是一个矛盾。天津铁路车站西货场就出现过这样的矛盾。西货场从去年十二月开始，掀起了装卸机械化半机械化运动。几天功夫，就创造出大批装卸工具，这些工具使某些单项作业的效率有了很大的提高，但是，总的装卸效率反而下降了，车辆在场停留时间也没有缩短，技术革命的优越性并没有表现出来。为什么会出现这种情况呢？从工具本身来看，主要是质量上都不够完备。如有的工具不好用，不方便，搬动它的时间往往比纯作业时间还长；有的作业环节还没有创造出工具来代替手工操作。这就是说，装卸机械化半机械化运动还没有完全适应搬运和装卸作业的变化多端和连续性强的特点，新生事物还处在低级阶段，所以，没有达到提高整个装卸效率的目的。怎样克服这个矛盾？是艰苦顽强地克服困难，使新生事物从不完备走向完备，达到提高劳动生产率的目的呢？还是就此作罢，按老办法装卸呢？当时西货场有一些干部选择了第二条道路，也就是向困难低头的道路。他们怕使用新工具效率低，完不成任务，在装卸任务重的时候，仍然采取增加人的办法。可是西货场党支部坚持走第一条道路，这是一条迎着困难向前挺进的道路。他们依靠群众，发动群众，不畏艰苦，不怕困难，积极改进已有的革新工具，使它完善起来，并且创造新的工具，填缺补齐，使新工具“配套成龙”，充分发挥效能，结果，目的达到了：工人的劳动生产率有很大提高，货车在场停留时间比年初缩短了39％，还节约了45％的装卸工人。
    这是一件很有说服力的事例，它告诉我们：办任何一件事情，切不可半途而废。装卸的机械化、半机械化运动，是一种革命运动，既然是革命，困难总会有的，而且越到后来还常常会出现一些更复杂的问题，越需要花费很大的力量去解决，这也是事物的发展由低到高的必然规律。可是只要我们抱定把革命贯彻到底的决心，坚持群众路线，工作深入细致，就一定能达到预定的目标，克服了困难，就争到顺利；克服了更大的困难，就争取到更大的顺利。装卸技术革命由低级阶段向高级阶段发展，也就是由不完备向完备的阶段发展，要做的工作更细致了，更复杂了，革新的工具要一件一件地整理、鉴定、选型和定型；各种工具要配套成龙，使主要工具与辅助工具，大工具与小工具，机械化工具与半机械化工具互相适应；一些还仍然依靠手工操作的薄弱环节和“难关”，要一个一个突破；企业管理和劳动组织在新的条件下，需要改进、调整。凡此种种均是预料中的事，问题在于我们的同志特别是做领导工作的同志，对形势有没有透彻的认识，是不是具有坚强的彻底的革命精神。自从开展装卸机械化半机械化运动以来，搬运、装卸工作的落后面貌已经有了很大的改变，但是还没有根本改变，而运输装卸任务随着生产的发展继续急剧地增长着。就全国来说，搬运、装卸作业仍然落后于生产运输的跃进形势，成为运输效率能不能大幅度提高的重要关键。工农业生产的持续跃进形势，要求加速物资流转，提高搬运、装卸效率；现代化大生产的运输方式，要求迅速改变旧的、肩挑人抬的装卸生产方式；整个国家的劳动力安排，要求节约装卸工人，并且，尽可能不临时动员大量的社会劳动力来突击。这些都是客观形势提出的要求，怎样才能实现这些要求呢？办法只有一条，这就是继续深入开展搬运、装卸的技术革命。就像在战斗中，打破了突破口以后，紧接着就要攻克敌人的堡垒，最后歼灭敌人一样，现在许多单位的装卸机械化和半机械化运动正处在这样的情况，形势是很好的，当然要“聚歼敌人”，必须要集中力量，进行一系列的艰苦细致的工作，譬如：要使装卸工具配套成龙，就必须对装卸作业的特点进行全面的调查研究，对上下工序，前后左右的情况都深知深解；就必须发动群众对已有的革新工具反复地研究改进，变劣为优，变笨为巧；就必须对尚未打破的“难关”进行认真分析，采取切实的措施，发动群众，一个个地解决。这些工作都一一做到家了，犹如水到渠成，问题就一定能得到解决。
    许多事实证明，有了坚强的、彻底的革命精神，再切切实实做好发动群众的工作，充分发挥群众的智慧和力量，认真贯彻因地制宜、就地取材、土洋结合的方针，装卸工具从不完备到一定程度的完备是能够办到的。拿比较困难的舱底作业来说，上海港工人就根据不同货物的特点制造出一套比较完备的装卸工具。如果舱底装的是煤炭、矿砂等散货，工人就用集体制成的一种抓斗，进入舱里，只要两个人操作，一次就能抓起两吨以上的煤炭或矿砂，一天装卸的数量等于六十多个工人同时用手工装卸的数量；如果舱底装的是规模大小不一的小杂货，就用一种“接装箱”，货物装进以后，连箱放在船上，卸货时连箱卸下，提高效率一倍多；如果是比较大件的杂货，就用一种装有十六只钩子的圆盘，连接卷扬机，工人只要把钩子套上货物，一次能卸二吨多；如果要卸舱底的粮包，就把木条运输机或皮带运输机伸进舱内，一包包粮食很快就能送到舱面。上海港的工人还把各道工序之间的机械连接起来，实现了装卸工具系统化的革新，从船舱到仓库使用机械化、半机械化工具进行连续作业。毛泽东同志说：“群众有伟大的创造力。中国人民中间，实在有成千成万的‘诸葛亮’，每个乡村，每个市镇，都有那里的‘诸葛亮’。”（毛泽东选集第三卷936页）事实正是这样，像上海港工人的创造力，像上海港工人中的“诸葛亮”，哪一个港口、车站和货场没有呢？依靠人民群众伟大的创造力，有什么困难不能克服呢？
    今年上半年，全国铁路车站、港口码头开展了空前规模的搬运、装卸机械化半机械化运动，群众自己设计和制造了许许多多装卸工具，例如，设备简易的滑溜化工具已在许多地方推行，有效地提高了装卸效率。下半年，运动进入巩固、推广、提高的阶段，又使大批的革新工具由不完善到完善，现在的关键是由单项或局部机具的改进，向配套成龙以至整个工序机械化连续作业的方向发展，既要保证提高搬运和装卸效率，又要保证货物的完整无损。要求越来越高，任务越来越重。但是，经过一年来的技术革新，各地都有了不少的装卸机具，积累了不少的经验，工人的技术水平也有了很大的提高。只要在这个基础上再加一把劲，把一件件的工作都细细致致地做好，把广大群众发动好，装卸的机械化半机械化运动就一定会再推进一步，促进装卸效率全面地大幅度地提高。
