    In the Days of Visiting the Soviet Union
    Hai Leng, Xiao Feng, Deligeer, Chen Xiaodong
    As the forty-third anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution approaches, we recall the friendly reception we received from the Soviet people during our visit to the Soviet Union as part of the Chinese journalists' delegation half a year ago, and all the joyful scenes we experienced seem to be vividly before our eyes.

    In early summer this year, our Chinese journalists' delegation, at the invitation of the Soviet Journalists' Association, went to the Soviet Union with deep friendship and high respect to participate in the "May Day" International Labor Day celebration. During our two weeks in the Soviet Union, we visited Moscow, Leningrad, the capital of the Georgian Republic, Tbilisi, the new city of Rustavi, and the "Lenin's Legacy Collective Farm" in the Lagodekhi district. We also visited Irkutsk in Siberia. We visited factories and collective farms, toured revolutionary historical sites and museums, and had extensive contact with workers, collective farm members, students, and children. Wherever we went, we received warm and brotherly reception and care. We deeply felt the profound and noble friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people.

    During our visit to the Soviet Union, we saw that the Soviet people were very concerned about our country's socialist construction. They were all jubilant and encouraged by the greatachievements our people had made in socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. On the eve of "May Day," we went to the Likhachev Automobile Factory in Moscow to participate in a celebration party and met old veterans of the Soviet guerrilla warfare during the Hungarian War (whom we met during our visit to Hungary). They repeatedly invited us to visit their homes and exchanged commemorative badges with each other. On "May Day" International Labor Day, we watched the parade in Red Square, and the parading masses repeatedly waved to the Chinese comrades on the reviewing stand and shouted "Sino-Soviet friendship!" "Hurrah!" In Tbilisi, we met a naval soldier in the lounge of the theater. He warmly shook hands with us and asked us to send his greetings to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. There was also a subway builder—a tunneling worker—who repeatedly asked us whether China's capital needed to build a subway. If it did, he was willing to come to China to be a tunneling worker to help with the construction. We visited Stalin's hometown, Gori. Along the way, a group of children picked bright red wildflowers. They innocently and lively gave the flowers to us and took pictures with us. The comrades in the Lagodekhi district of the Georgian Republic and the members of the "Lenin's Legacy Collective Farm" enthusiastically invited us to dinner, treated us with a local national wine banquet for receiving distinguished guests, sang and danced, and regarded our visit as a great happy event. When we arrived in Leningrad, the holy land of the revolution, we visited the Zhdanov Young Pioneer Palace. The counselors and Young Pioneers of the Young Pioneer Palace were happy and kind to tell us that they had received letters and souvenirs from the Young Pioneers in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. They led us to visit the toys they made themselves, and also led us to visit the gifts given to them by guests and children from various countries, including precious gifts given to them by Chinese guests and Chinese children. When we were about to say goodbye, the children enthusiastically put their red scarves on us; when we gave them Chairman Mao's commemorative badges, the children shouted happily, "Mao Zedong, Beijing!" The deep friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people will always be treasured in our memories. When celebrating the forty-third anniversary of the great October Revolution, we feel even more that this great and eternal friendship is the happiness of our two peoples.

    During our visit to the Soviet Union, we also saw in factories and rural areas that the Soviet people were working diligently in communist labor and creating new achievements in industrial and agricultural production in order to overfulfill the Seven-Year Plan and for a better life tomorrow.

    We visited the new city of Rustavi in the Georgian Republic. This new city is a steel city. It and the steel joint factory were born simultaneously on the black soil prairie of the Georgian Republic in 1945. When we arrived in this city, we mainly visited the "Transcaucasian Stalin Steel Joint Factory" built in 1950. Twenty teams in this factory are striving for the title of Communist Labor Team, and six teams have already obtained this glorious title; a section of the steel plate workshop and the open-hearth furnace workshop are also striving for the title of Communist Labor Collective. The pipe rolling workshop plans to overproduce one thousand tons of steel pipes this year, save 500,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, save 150 tons of heavy oil, increase labor efficiency by 1% compared to 1959, and train 250 new workers. The 38 members of the third team of the pipe rolling workshop won the glorious title of Communist Labor Team in 1959. The team's achievements are: each shift must over-roll ten tons of steel pipes, and in reality, they over-rolled twelve and a half tons; they improved the quality, and first-class products reached 98.7%; they completed the task of saving electricity and fuel; everyone in the team is studying politics, technology, and culture, and all but three people have an intermediate or higher level of education, and six people have reached the university level; the whole team is united, friendly, and helps each other, overcoming shortcomings. In technical innovation, this team created an automatic cooling method for pipe rolling drills, which greatly saves the time for replacing drills; previously, the drill had to be changed every time a steel pipe was rolled. With the automatic cooling method, it only needs to be changed once per shift. This will increase the output by at least 10% and increase labor productivity by 70%. The comrades in the factory happily told us: The automatic equipment we manufactured for the steel rolling workshop of the Baotou Iron and Steel Plant in China also uses this cooling method.

    When we visited the Moscow Small Car Factory in Moscow, the annual output of cars in the last year of the Seven-Year Plan—1965—will be doubled compared to 1959, while the number of workers will only increase by 16%; labor productivity will increase by 40.6% compared to 1958, and costs will be reduced by 7.4% compared to 1959. Many workshops in the Moscow Small Car Factory have automatic operation lines. An automatic operation line in the machine shop, with 24 machines, only needs three workers and six adjusters. A month ago, 35 people were managing 30 machines; another automatic operation line allows one person to manage eight machines. Two hundred and twenty-five teams and more than three thousand workers in this factory are participating in the competition for the title of Communist Labor Team and Shock Worker. Last year, this factory saved the state ten million rubles in the implementation of reasonable suggestions from employees. This year, it plans to save another eleven million rubles and use the saved steel to produce 600 more small cars. This year, this factory is determined to strive to become a Communist Labor Collective.

    In Leningrad, we visited the "Sestroretsky Tool Factory," which has a history of 240 years. Forty-three years ago, on the eve of the great October Socialist Revolution, Lenin once disguised himself as a worker in this factory, using the alias Ivanov, and took refuge near Lake Razliv on the Gulf of Finland under the cover of En. A. Yemelyanov, an old worker in this factory. After the outbreak of the October Revolution, this factory sent 1,200 people to join the Red Guards and took on the glorious task of guarding the Smolny Palace—the headquarters of the October Revolution. After 1921, this factory developed from manufacturing drills to manufacturing gauges, cutting tools, and even various types of machine tools. In 1939, it manufactured a scoring computer. During the Great Patriotic War, the factory was relocated and concentrated its efforts on manufacturing weapons and ammunition to strike the fascist invading beasts; the workers also bravely participated in the Patriotic War. Today, this factory has resumed its task of manufacturing mechanical tools. The Party organization and the workers of this factory are continuing to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, carrying out communist construction with a revolutionary heroic spirit. Their slogan is: Strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years. This year, they will increase the output of products by 13% compared to 1958, and by 55% by 1965.

    In early May, we visited the Lagodekhi district of the Georgian Republic, which is a beautiful mountainous area with 9,000 farm households, 73% of whom are of Georgian ethnicity and 11% of whom are of Azerbaijani ethnicity. This area is rich in tobacco, silk, and spice crops. Comrades from the district committee told us that the 21 collective farms in the district are doing everything possible to increase the production of cash crops and will sell more agricultural products to the state this year. Last year, 3,500 tons of tobacco were sold to the state, and 3,700 tons will be sold this year; last year, 3,400 tons of spice raw materials (roses) were sold, and 4,000 tons will be sold this year; last year, 158 tons of silkworm cocoons were sold, and 170 tons will be sold this year. They proudly praised the local specialty, roses. They said that roses are a valuable raw material for making perfume essence. They work hard to manage them and improve the refining methods, and the output of perfume essence has increased by about 50%. Originally, each ton of roses only produced about 800 grams of perfume essence, but now it can produce 1,200 grams. This saves a lot of foreign exchange for the motherland. Because importing one kilogram of perfume essence costs 26,000 rubles, while manufacturing it yourself only costs 5,000 rubles. Therefore, the higher the output, the more foreign exchange is saved. They also thanked China very enthusiastically for its help. They said that this district received silkworm seeds from China, and the harvest was good and very satisfactory. They hope to get more of these good silkworm seeds. The collective farms led by this district have been constantly merging, from small to large: in 1953, there were 80 collective farms, which were merged into 29 last year, and 21 this spring. They believe that this is more conducive to giving play to the superiority of large-scale management of large collectives and continuously expanding the public economy. Local industry is developing here. There are now tobacco factories, aromatic oil factories, furniture factories, canning factories, cream factories, etc. The total output value of the canning factory alone will increase fourfold this year compared to last year. In this beautiful mountainous area, we also visited the "Lenin's Legacy Collective Farm" in this district. This farm is organized by a labor village with 700 farm households, with 1,500 hectares of cultivated land. The main crops are tobacco, grapes, and roses. Animal husbandry is also relatively developed. Last year's total income was 6.7 million rubles, and it is planned to increase this year's total income by another 55.2% on the basis of last year, bringing the farm's production to a higher level. It is planned to sell 162 tons of meat to the state this year (32 tons last year), 350 tons of milk (230 tons last year), and 17.5 tons of silkworm cocoons (16 tons last year).

    In mid-May, we came to a new city in the Irkutsk region—Angarsk. This city began construction in 1950, clearing the way through the forest. Now, there are 147,000 residents here, and modern industries such as cement factories, motor factories, machine repair factories, oil processing factories, and power plants have been built. We visited the modern residential construction site. Prefabricated components and mechanized construction methods are widely used here. In the Soviet construction industry, the slogan of building well, quickly, economically, and practically has been put forward. Here, under the encouragement of this slogan, new construction methods are adopted to increase the speed of construction, and more than 130,000 square meters of new housing will be built this year. We also visited the Irkutsk Hydropower Station with a generating capacity of 660,000 kilowatts and watched a documentary about the construction of the world's largest Bratsk Hydropower Station, which has a generating capacity seven times greater than the Irkutsk Hydropower Station. We saw that huge changes are taking place in Siberia. Angarsk has created a thriving young city in the virgin forest in the ten years from its founding in 1950 to this year; Bratsk will grow one or two times faster than Angarsk. Four thousand houses were built in 1959, and about 5,000 will be completed this year. The Bratsk Hydropower Station, which will have a generating capacity of 4.5 million kilowatts, is being accelerated. Bratsk is forming a huge industrial center in Soviet Siberia.

    Today, on the eve of the forty-third anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we jubilantly celebrate this great festival shared by the revolutionary people of the world. We remember the friendship during our visit to the Soviet Union even more, and we cherish the friendship and unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples even more. We celebrate the great October Revolution and congratulate the Soviet people on their new and greater achievements in building communism. We shout that the friendship and unity between China and the Soviet Union will last forever. (Attached picture)

    在访问苏联的日子里
    海棱、萧风、德礼格尔、陈晓东
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年即将到来的时候，我们回忆起半年前参加中国新闻工作者代表团访问苏联的那些日子里受到的苏联人民充满友情的接待，所经过的一切欢乐的情景，就好像历历在眼前一样。
    今年初夏，我们中国新闻工作者代表团应苏联记者协会的邀请，带着深厚的友谊和崇高的敬意，到苏联参加了“五一”国际劳动节庆祝典礼。在苏联生活的两周中，我们访问了莫斯科、列宁格勒，访问了格鲁吉亚共和国首都第比利斯、新城市鲁斯塔维和拉果德赫区的“列宁遗训集体农庄”，还访问了西伯利亚的伊尔库次克，我们访问了工厂、集体农庄，参观了革命史迹和博物馆，和工人、集体农庄庄员、学生、儿童，作了广泛的接触。所到之处，受到热情的、兄弟般的接待和关怀。我们深深地体会到苏联人民对中国人民深厚的、崇高的友谊。
    在我们访问苏联的日子里，看到了苏联人民十分关心我国的社会主义建设事业，他们都为我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就而欢欣鼓舞。“五一”前夕，我们到莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车厂参加庆祝晚会，遇见苏联在匈牙利战争时期的游击队的老战士（我们在访问匈牙利时认识的）。他们再三邀请我们到他们家里去作客，并互相交换了纪念章。“五一”国际劳动节我们在红场观礼，游行群众一再向观礼台上的中国同志招手致意，并高呼“中苏友好”！“乌拉”！在第比利斯，我们在剧院的休息室里，遇到了一位海军战士，他亲切地和我们握手，要我们代他向中国人民解放军问好。还有一位地下铁道的建设者——掘进工人，他一再问我们，中国首都要不要建设地下铁道，如果要建设，他愿意到中国来当一个掘进工人帮助建设。我们曾到斯大林的故乡戈里去参观。途中，一群小朋友采来了鲜红的野花。他们天真活泼地把鲜花送给了我们，并和我们一起照了相。格鲁吉亚共和国拉果德赫区的同志们和“列宁遗训集体农庄”的庄员们，热情地请我们吃饭，用当地接待贵宾的民族酒筵招待我们，载歌载舞，把我们的访问看成是一件大喜事。当我们到达革命圣地列宁格勒后，参观了日丹诺夫少先宫。少先宫的辅导员和少先队员们，高兴地亲切地告诉我们，他们接到了北京、上海等地少先队小朋友写给他们的信，送给他们的纪念品。他们引我们参观了他们自己制造的玩具等等，还引我们参观了各国来宾和小朋友送给他们的礼品，其中也有中国客人和中国小朋友送给他们的珍爱的礼物。当我们要告别的时候，小朋友们热情地把自己的红领巾分别给我们带上；当我们把毛主席纪念章送给他们的时候，小朋友们高兴得喊着“毛泽东，北京！”苏联人民对中国人民的深情厚谊，我们永远珍贵地留在自己的记忆里。当庆祝伟大十月革命四十三周年的时候，我们更觉得这种伟大的永恒的友谊，是我们中苏两国人民的幸福。
    在我们访问苏联的日子里，在工厂、农村还看到了苏联人民为了超额完成七年计划，为了明天的更加美好的生活，辛勤地进行着共产主义的劳动，创造着工农业生产的新成就。
    我们在格鲁吉亚共和国访问了新城市鲁斯塔维。这个新城市是一个钢铁城市。它和钢铁联合工厂在1945年同时诞生在格鲁吉亚共和国的黑土草原上。我们到达这个城市，主要访问了在1950年建成的“外高加索斯大林钢铁联合工厂”。这个厂有二十个队在争取共产主义劳动队的称号，已有六个队取得了这个光荣称号；还有钢板车间和平炉车间的一个工段，正在争取共产主义劳动集体的称号。轧管车间今年计划超额生产钢管一千吨，节约电五十万度，节约重油一百五十吨，比1959年提高劳动效率1％，并培养新工人二百五十人。轧管车间第三队三十八人，1959年已得到共产主义劳动队的光荣称号，这个队的成绩是：每班都要超额轧制钢管十吨，而实际超额轧制了十二吨半；提高了质量，一等品达到了98.7％；完成了节约电力、燃料的任务；全队每人都在学习政治、技术、文化，除三个人外，都有中等以上的文化程度，六个人达到了大学程度；全队团结友爱，互相帮助，克服缺点。这个队在技术革新中创造了轧管钻头自动冷却法，大大节省了更换钻头的时间；以前是每轧制一根钢管就要换一次钻头，有了自动冷却法，一班换一次就行了。这就使产量至少可以增加10％，劳动生产率提高70％。厂里的同志们高兴地告诉我们说：我们给中国包头钢铁厂轧钢车间制造的自动设备，也是用的这种冷却法。
    我们在莫斯科参观了莫斯科小型汽车厂，这个厂在七年计划的最后一年——1965年，汽车的年产量要比1959年提高一倍，而工人却只增加16％；劳动生产率要比1958年提高40.6％，成本要比1959年降低7.4％。莫斯科小型汽车厂的许多车间都有了自动作业线，机工车间的一条自动作业线，二十四台机器，有三个工人、六个调节员就行了，一个月以前是三十五个人在管理三十台机器；另一条自动作业线，一个人可以管理八台机器。这个厂有二百二十五个队、三千多工人参加争取共产主义劳动队和突击手称号的竞赛运动。去年，这个厂在实现职工的合理化建议中，给国家节省了一千万卢布，今年准备再节省一千一百万卢布，并要用节约的钢材多生产六百辆小型汽车。今年，这个厂决心争取成为共产主义劳动集体。
    在列宁格勒，我们访问了“西斯特洛列茨基工具厂”，这个工厂已有二百四十年的历史。四十三年前，伟大的十月社会主义革命前夜，列宁曾经化装成这个厂的工人，化名伊凡诺夫，在这个厂的老工人恩·阿·叶梅里雅诺夫掩护下在芬兰湾附近拉兹里夫湖畔避难。十月革命爆发，这个工厂派出了一千二百人参加了赤卫队，担任了保卫斯莫尔尼宫——十月革命指挥部所在地的光荣的任务。1921年以后，这个厂由制造钻头发展到制造量具、刃具，以至制造多种型式的机床。1939年曾制造过计分计算机。在伟大的卫国战争年代，曾一度迁厂，集中力量制造打击法西斯侵略野兽的武器和军火；工人们还英勇地参加了卫国战争。今天，这个工厂已经恢复了制造机械工具的任务。这个厂的党组织和工人们，正继续发扬光荣的革命传统，以革命的英雄主义精神进行共产主义建设，他们的口号是：争取五年完成七年计划。今年，他们要把产品产量比1958年提高13％，到1965年则提高55％。
    5月上旬，我们访问了格鲁吉亚共和国的拉果德赫区，这是一个美丽的山区，有九千户农庄庄员，73％是格鲁吉亚民族，还有11％是阿塞拜疆民族。这里盛产烟叶、蚕丝和香料作物等。区委的同志们告诉我们，全区二十一个集体农庄正在千方百计地增产经济作物，今年要生产更多的农产品交售给国家。去年交售给国家的烟叶是三千五百吨，今年要交售三千七百吨；去年交售香料原料（玫瑰）三千四百吨，今年要交售四千吨；去年交售蚕茧一百五十八吨，今年要交售一百七十吨。他们非常自豪地称赞当地的特产玫瑰。他们说，玫瑰是制造香精的名贵原料。他们努力经营，改进提炼方法，香精产量已经提高50％左右。原来每吨玫瑰只产八百克左右香精，现在已经能产一千二百克了。这就为祖国节省了很多外汇。因为进口一公斤香精，就要付出二万六千卢布，自己制造只要五千卢布就够了。所以，产量越高，节省外汇越多。他们又非常热情地感谢中国的帮助。他们说，这个区得到了中国的桑蚕种，收成好，非常满意。他们希望能够多得到一些这样的好蚕种。这个区领导的集体农庄曾不断合并，由小变大：1953年集体农庄是八十个，到去年并成二十九个，今年春又并成二十一个。他们认为，这样更便于发挥大集体的大规模经营的优越性和不断地扩大公有经济。这里正在发展地方工业。现在已经有烤烟厂、芳香油厂、家具厂、罐头厂、奶油厂等，仅罐头厂今年的总产值就要比去年增长四倍。在这个美丽的山区，我们还访问了这个区的“列宁遗训集体农庄”。这个农庄是拥有七百户农庄庄员的劳动村所组织的，有一千五百公顷耕地，主要的农作物是烟叶、葡萄和玫瑰。牲畜业也较发展。去年的总收入是六百七十万卢布，计划把今年的总收入在去年的基础上再提高55.2％，把农庄的生产提到更高的水平。计划今年交售给国家的肉类是一百六十二吨（去年是三十二吨），牛奶三百五十吨（去年是二百三十吨），蚕茧是十七吨半（去年是十六吨）。
    5月中旬，我们来到了伊尔库次克州的一个新兴城市——安加拉城。这个城市是从1950年从森林里披荆斩棘开始建设的。现在，这里已经有十四万七千居民，建设了水泥厂、电机厂、机修厂、石油加工厂、发电站等等的近代工业。我们参观了现代化住宅建筑工地。这里广泛采用了预制构件，机械化施工的方法。在苏联的建筑工业中，提出了好快省地进行建设的口号。这里就在这个口号的鼓舞下，采取新的建筑方法，提高施工速度，要在今年建成十三万多平方米的新住宅。我们还参观了拥有发电能力六十六万瓩的伊尔库次克水电站，观看了正在兴建的比伊尔库次克水电站发电能力大七倍的全世界最大的布拉次克水电站的纪录影片。我们看到，西伯利亚正在发生着巨大的变化。安加拉城从1950年建城到今年是十年，已经在原始森林里创建了欣欣向荣的青年城市；布拉次克将比安加拉城成长的速度快一两倍。 1959年曾建筑了四千套住宅，今年则要完成五千套左右。将拥有发电能力四百五十万瓩的布拉次克水电站，正在加速建设。布拉次克正在形成苏维埃西伯利亚的一个巨大的工业中心。
    今天，正是伟大十月社会主义革命四十三周年的前夕，我们欢欣鼓舞地庆祝这个全世界革命人民共同的伟大节日，我们更加想起了在访问苏联的日子里的友情，更加珍贵中苏两国人民的友谊和团结。我们庆祝伟大的十月革命节，祝贺苏联人民在建设共产主义中取得的更新更大的成就，我们高呼中苏友谊和团结万古长青。（附图片）
