    Learning from Each Other's Strengths
    ——Eight Sends Off Comrades Supporting the Agricultural Production Frontline
    Ge Song
    Comrades going to the countryside will first encounter grassroots cadres who originally worked in the countryside and will live, work, and spend their days with them. This will raise an important issue, namely, the issue of relationships. If the relationships are handled well, the work can be done well, and the Party's policies can blossom and bear fruit. If the relationships are not handled well, the work will suffer, and the Party's policies cannot be well implemented.

    The absolute majority of our grassroots cadres are loyal to the cause of the Party. They listen to the Party and act according to the Party's words. They are the advanced elements among the masses, good cadres of the Party, and good stewards of the people. Their many fine qualities and many strengths are worth learning from.

    Many grassroots cadres are native to the area, or have been working locally since the land reform and cooperativization periods for five or ten years. Therefore, they are very familiar with the Party's policies and production conditions and have close ties with the masses. This is their strength.

    What are the strengths of the cadres sent down from the leading organs? They have a relatively good understanding of the Party's policies, and many comrades also have a high level of theoretical and cultural knowledge. However, they have spent most of their time in cities and offices in the past, and they know little about the actual situation. They are unfamiliar with the people and the place when they first arrive. The strengths of grassroots cadres are often what these comrades lack. Even if they work for six months, a year, or two years, they are still far behind the comrades who were originally at the grassroots level.

    Chairman Mao said in "Rectify the Party's Style of Work": "External cadres and local cadres have their own strengths and weaknesses. They must learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses in order to make progress." Comrades going to the countryside and local grassroots cadres should cooperate closely, learn from each other's strengths, and make up for their weaknesses, so that the Party's policies can be better combined with the local reality. Only in this way can the comrades supporting the agricultural production frontline take root locally and make the Party's policies bloom with infinitely beautiful flowers. The Party and Chairman Mao taught us to be humble, to rely on, respect, and learn from local cadres, and to go deep among the masses, and to avoid "wa-la-wa-la" as soon as we get off the bus. This is what we should keep firmly in mind. Close unity between external cadres and local cadres can make the team neat and in step. Cadres from leading organs, or grassroots cadres, although they have worked in different positions in the past, are all working for the development of the Party's cause. Now they have been entrusted by the people to shoulder the heavy responsibility of running agriculture and grain production on a large scale and fight side by side. With a common goal, they have a common language. They will certainly work together in a common cause to make the rural people's communes even more colorful.

    取长补短
    ——八送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    到农村去的同志，首先要遇到原来在农村工作的基层干部，并且要同他们朝夕相处，一起工作。这就会发生一个重要问题，即关系问题。关系搞得好，工作就能做好，党的政策就能开花、结果；关系搞不好，工作就会受损失，党的政策就不能很好地贯彻。
    我们基层干部中的绝对大多数是对党的事业忠心耿耿的，他们听党的话，照党的话办事。他们是群众中的先进分子，党的好干部，人民的好当家人。他们的许多优良品质，许多长处，是值得很好学习的。
    基层干部很多是土生土长的，或者在当地从土地改革、合作化时期开始就已工作了五年、十年。所以，对党的政策和生产情况非常熟悉，同群众有紧密的联系。这是他们的长处。
    从领导机关下去的干部的长处是什么呢？他们比较了解党的政策，有不少同志也有较高的理论和文化水平。但是，他们过去大部分时间在城市、坐办公室，对实际情况了解得少，初到一个地方去，人地生疏。基层干部的长处，往往是这些同志所缺乏的。即使他们工作了半年、一年、两年，也还是远远赶不上原在基层的同志们的。
    毛主席在《整顿党的作风》中说：“外来干部和本地干部各有长处，也各有短处，必须互相取长补短，才能有进步。”下乡的同志和当地基层干部，亲密合作，取长补短，就能使党的政策更好地和当地实际情况结合。也只有这样，支援农业生产第一线的同志，才能在当地生根，使党的政策开出无限鲜艳的花朵。党和毛主席教导我们要谦逊，要依靠、尊重和学习当地干部，深入群众，切忌“下车伊始”，便哇啦哇啦。这是我们应该牢牢记住的。外来干部和本地干部亲密团结，就能使队伍整齐，步调一致。领导机关下去的干部，或者基层干部，虽然过去所处的岗位不同，但都是为了党的事业的发展而工作的；如今他们受了人民的委托，挑起大办农业、大办粮食的重担并肩作战。有着一致的目标，就有共同的语言，他们一定会在共同的事业中，齐心协力，把农村人民公社办得更加生色。
