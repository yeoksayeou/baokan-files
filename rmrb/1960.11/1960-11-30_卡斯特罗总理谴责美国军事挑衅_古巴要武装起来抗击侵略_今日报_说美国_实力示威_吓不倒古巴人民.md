Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 28th: Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro condemned on the evening of the 27th that the U.S. Navy's patrols and military exercises in the Caribbean Sea are attempts to create tension. However, the imperialist ships patrolling the Caribbean Sea receive more contempt and a further decline in credibility, and demonstrate their fear.

Castro said, "When a revolution occurred in Guatemala, they hurriedly sent ironclad ships and cannons. What does this show? Fear. What does this mean? Revolution does not need to be exported; it will arise on the American continent itself." He continued, Cuba wants peace, but "we will continue to improve our military defense because the most reliable guarantee against imperialism is to be well-armed." He pointed out, "This military preparedness gives us the right to continue working."

Castro made these remarks at a Havana University rally commemorating the students who died in 1871. On November 27th of that year, eight students were killed by Spanish colonialists in the struggle for Cuban independence. Yesterday, rallies were held in the capital and all major cities in Cuba to commemorate the eighty-ninth anniversary of their martyrdom.

In his speech, Castro also condemned counter-revolutionary forces for attempting to turn the church and Catholic schools into tools to oppose the people. He said that the revolution had never taken a hostile attitude towards religion; it practices freedom of belief and respects both believers and non-believers. However, in some primary schools, counter-revolutionaries openly preach class hatred against workers, peasants, and poor people. A group of patriotic youths were expelled from Villanova Catholic University. This university is "an American university, a one hundred percent pro-American university." There are still Batista teachers in middle schools, and pastors who receive checks from counter-revolutionaries. Agents in clerical garb use churches to conduct sinister propaganda. Castro emphasized, "These people are serving international forces."

In concluding his speech, Castro called on Havana University to increasingly draw closer to the people as the best commemoration of the martyred students.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 27th: The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published a commentary today exposing the U.S. Navy's provocative military exercises, including ground and anti-aircraft fire, to be conducted in the Caribbean Sea area between Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica from December 1st for a month. The commentary said, "The blatant provocative nature of this exercise is self-evident." The newspaper pointed out: The imperialist navy is attempting to hold a "show of force" near the east coast of Cuba. Considering that U.S. ships have already been stationed near the west coast of Cuba under Eisenhower's orders to support the Somoza and Idigoras dictatorships and threaten Cuba, this is a pincer encirclement of Cuba.

The newspaper pointed out: "Some facts prior to this 'exercise' more clearly expose its provocative nature. These facts are: First, the U.S. troops stationed at Caimanera in Cuba frequently hold combat exercises; second, the United States used a large air transport team to transport its troops to Panama; third, the troops at various U.S. bases in Puerto Rico conducted military exercises; fourth, an aircraft carrier and other ships were sent to the territorial waters of Guatemala and Nicaragua."

"Hoy" emphasized: This provocative "exercise" is destined to suffer a greater defeat. The newspaper stressed that in the past, the Cuban people were not intimidated either by the Batista dictatorship's troops armed with American weapons or by the American military advisors who directed them to sweep and bomb undefended villages; today, they will never be intimidated by the exercises of the American armed forces. The newspaper said, "Cuba believes in the justice of its cause, believes in its military preparedness, and believes in the support of the people of all countries."

    卡斯特罗总理谴责美国军事挑衅
    古巴要武装起来抗击侵略
    “今日报”说美国“实力示威”吓不倒古巴人民
    新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗27日晚谴责说，美国海军在加勒比海巡逻和举行军事演习是企图制造紧张局势。但是，帝国主义的舰只在加勒比海巡逻所得到的是更多的蔑视和信誉的更加低落，并且表明他们害怕了。
    卡斯特罗说，“危地马拉发生了革命，他们就慌忙派出铁甲舰和大炮。这说明什么呢？恐惧。这意味着什么呢？革命是不需要输出的，它会在美洲大陆自己产生”。他接着说，古巴要和平，但是“我们将继续改善我们的军事防御，因为防范帝国主义的最可靠的保障就是好好地武装起来”。他指出，“这种军事准备给了我们以继续工作的权利”。
    卡斯特罗是在哈瓦那大学为纪念1871年殉难学生而举行的大会上说这番话的。在那一年的11月27日有八名学生在争取古巴独立的斗争中被西班牙殖民主义者杀害。昨天，首都和古巴所有的重要城市都举行集会，纪念他们殉难八十九周年。
    在讲话中，卡斯特罗还谴责反革命势力企图把教会和天主教学校变成它反对人民的工具。他说，革命没有采取过任何敌视宗教的态度，它实行信仰自由，尊重信教的人和不信教的人。但是，在一些小学校里，反革命公开地宣扬对工人、农民和贫苦人民的阶级仇恨。一批爱国青年被维里亚努瓦的天主教大学开除了。这所大学是“美国大学，百分之百的亲美大学”。中学里还有巴蒂斯塔的教师，有从反革命那里领取支票的牧师。披着法衣的特务则利用教堂进行罪恶的宣传。卡斯特罗强调指出，“这些人是为国际势力效劳的。”
    在结束讲话时，卡斯特罗号召哈瓦那大学日益接近人民，作为对殉难学生的最好的纪念。
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴《今日报》今天发表评论，揭露美国海军将从12月1日起在古巴、海地和牙买加之间的加勒比海地区举行为时一个月的包括地面和高射火力在内的挑衅性军事演习。评论说：“这次演习的露骨的挑衅性质是显而易见的”。报纸指出：帝国主义者的海军企图在靠近古巴的东海岸举行“实力示威”，如果考虑到美国的舰只已经奉艾森豪威尔为支持索摩查和伊迪戈拉斯独裁政权和威胁古巴的命令而陈兵古巴西海岸附近海面的这种情况的话，这是一种对古巴的钳形包围。
    报纸指出：在这次“演习之前的一些事实更清楚地暴露了它的挑衅性质。这些事实有：第一，美国驻古巴卡伊马内拉的部队经常举行作战演习；第二，美国利用一支庞大的空中运输队把它的军队运到了巴拿马；第三，美国驻波多黎各的各个基地的部队进行了军事演习；第四，把一艘航空母舰和其他舰只开往危地马拉和尼加拉瓜领海”。
    《今日报》强调说：这次挑衅性的“演习”注定了要遭到更大的失败。这家报纸着重指出，在过去，古巴人民无论是在手拿美国武器的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的军队面前或者是在指挥它进行扫荡和轰炸不设防的村镇的美国军事顾问面前都没有被吓倒，今天他们也决不会被美国武装部队的演习所吓倒。报纸说，“古巴相信它的事业的正义性，相信它的军事准备和世界各国人民的支援。”
