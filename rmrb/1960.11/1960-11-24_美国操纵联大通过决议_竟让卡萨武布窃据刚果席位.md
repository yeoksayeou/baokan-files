Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd, New York: Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly plenary session passed a resolution on the evening of the 22nd from the Credentials Committee to agree to a group of people appointed by Kasavubu to illegally seize Congo's seat at the United Nations.

During the two days of the 21st and 22nd, when the General Assembly continued to hold plenary sessions to discuss the issue of the Congo government's representation in the UN General Assembly, although representatives from many countries opposed the United States' attempt to negate the legal government of Lumumba through the UN General Assembly, the United States brazenly started its voting machine and illegally deprived the legal government of Lumumba of the right to attend the United Nations General Assembly.

Before the vote, the representative of Guinea proposed an amendment to postpone the vote on this issue, the delegation of Mali proposed a motion to temporarily adjourn the meeting, and the delegation of Ghana also proposed a motion to suspend the debate indefinitely, but all were rejected by the General Assembly manipulated by the United States. After the resolution of the Credentials Committee was passed, the representative of Mali immediately declared that Mali would withdraw from the "Mediation Committee" that the United Nations General Assembly was about to send to Congo.

During the two-day meeting, representatives from socialist countries and many Asian and African countries spoke out against the resolution of the Credentials Committee and condemned the United States and other colonial countries for interfering in Congo's internal affairs and conspiring to continue colonial rule in Congo.

Soviet representative Zorin, in his speech on the 22nd, again condemned the United States for forcibly imposing the decision to deprive the legal government of Lumumba in Congo of its rights on the General Assembly. He pointed out that this practice by the United States is against the interests of the Congolese people.

Malian representative Aw emphasized that depriving the legal government of Lumumba of its right to representation is tantamount to opposing an independent Congo. Guinean representative Ismail Touré emphasized in his speech on the 21st that if the United Nations recognizes the qualifications of the representatives appointed by Kasavubu, it would be supporting him against the legal government and parliament of Congo, which means recognizing the secession of Katanga Province and abandoning the principle of Congolese unity. Touré also declared that if the United Nations recognizes the representative rights of a group of people appointed by Kasavubu, Guinea will withdraw from the "Mediation Committee."

    美国操纵联大通过决议
    竟让卡萨武布窃据刚果席位
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：在美国的操纵下，联合国大会全体会议22日晚上通过了资格审查委员会的关于同意由卡萨武布指派的一批人窃据刚果在联合国席位的决议。
    在21和22日两天，大会继续举行全体会议讨论刚果政府在联大的代表权问题时，尽管许多国家的代表都反对美国这种企图通过联合国大会来否定卢蒙巴合法政府的阴谋，美国仍然悍然开动了它的表决机器，非法剥夺了卢蒙巴合法政府出席联合国大会的权利。
    在表决之前，几内亚代表提出了延期就这一问题进行表决的修正案，马里代表团提出了要求暂时休会的提案，加纳代表团也提出了无限期暂停辩论的提案，但是都被美国操纵的大会否决了。在资格审查委员会的决议被通过后，马里代表立即声明，马里退出联合国大会即将派去刚果的“调解委员会”。
    在两天的会议中，社会主义国家和许多亚非国家的代表都发言反对资格审查委员会的决议，并且谴责美国和其他殖民国家干涉刚果内政和阴谋继续在刚果的殖民统治。
    苏联代表佐林在22日发言时再次谴责美国硬要把剥夺刚果卢蒙巴合法政府的权利的决定加在大会头上。他指出，美国这种做法是违反刚果人民的利益的。
    马里代表阿乌强调说，剥夺卢蒙巴合法政府的代表权，就等于反对独立的刚果。几内亚代表伊斯梅尔·杜尔21日在发言中强调说，如果联合国承认卡萨武布指派的代表的资格，那就是支持他反对刚果的合法政府和议会，也就是承认加丹加省的分裂和摒弃刚果统一的原则。杜尔还声明，如果联合国承认卡萨武布指派的一批人的代表权，几内亚将退出“调解委员会”。
