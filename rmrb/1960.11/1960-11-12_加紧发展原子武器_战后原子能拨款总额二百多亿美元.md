Xinhua News Agency, Washington Dispatch: The US government's Atomic Energy Commission's fiscal report for the 1960 fiscal year, released on the 6th, indicates that the United States is vigorously developing atomic weapons.

    The Atomic Energy Commission's report stated that it spent nearly $2.62 billion during the year, a large portion of which was used for nuclear weapons development. This is an increase of more than $120 million over the previous year. The report also stated that since World War II, the United States has spent more than $23 billion on atomic energy development, including for military purposes.

    Just days before the report was published, Murray, the former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, revealed that the United States is developing a new type of atomic weapon specifically designed for killing people. Murray, like many American politicians, also advocated that the United States resume nuclear testing, saying that not conducting nuclear tests "hinders the United States' position in gaining military and political strength."

    At the same time, the US Air Force recently revealed that work on the US intercontinental missile development has also been stepped up. The Air Force boasted that the first "Minuteman" intercontinental missile operational squadron would be completed in July 1962, a year ahead of schedule.

    加紧发展原子武器
    战后原子能拨款总额二百多亿美元
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府原子能委员会在6日公布的1960财政年度的财政报告表明，美国正在大力发展原子武器。
    原子能委员会的报告说，在这一年度它共花了将近二十六亿两千万美元，其中很大一部分是用于发展核武器方面的。这比上一年度增加了一亿二千多万美元。这份报告还说，自从第二次世界大战期间以来，美国在包括军事目的在内的原子能发展工作上面，共花了二百三十多亿美元。
    就在这个报告发表的前几天，原子能委员会前主席墨莱透露，美国正在发展一种专门用来杀人的新型原子武器。墨莱并且同美国许多政界人士一样，鼓吹美国恢复核试验，他说，不进行核试验“阻碍美国取得军事和政治实力的地位”。
    同时，美国空军部最近透露，美国试制洲际导弹的工作，也一直在加紧进行。空军部扬言，第一个“民兵”式洲际导弹作战中队要争取比预定计划提前一年在1962年7月建成。
