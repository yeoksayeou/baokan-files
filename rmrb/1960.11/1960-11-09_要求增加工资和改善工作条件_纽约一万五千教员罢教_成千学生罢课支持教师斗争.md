Xinhua News Agency, November 8th Dispatch from New York: Approximately 15,000 elementary and secondary school teachers launched the first strike in New York City's history on the 7th.

The strike was initiated by the United Federation of Teachers of New York City, which has 10,000 members, accounting for a quarter of the 40,000 elementary and secondary school teachers in New York City.

From the early morning of the 7th, striking teachers set up picket lines around many schools and marched with signs. Many teachers who were not members of the union also did not attend school. The strike covered 837 public schools in New York City.

Some of the largest schools have been forced to close. Thousands of students are also supporting their teachers by striking. The strike is to demand higher wages for various professional teachers, a rest period after lunch, and extended sick leave. The United Federation of Teachers also accused the City Board of Education of breaking its promises on collective bargaining and sick leave wages.

The New York City authorities are attempting to undermine the strike through threats. The New York City Superintendent of Education, John Theobald, threatened to invoke the New York State law prohibiting strikes by public employees to dismiss all teachers participating in the strike.

    要求增加工资和改善工作条件
    纽约一万五千教员罢教
    成千学生罢课支持教师斗争
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：大约一万五千名中小学教员7日举行纽约市有史以来的第一次罢教。
    这次罢教是由纽约市教师联合会发起的；教师联合会拥有一万名会员，占纽约全市四万名中小学教员的四分之一。
    罢教的教员从7日清晨起就在许多学校周围布置了纠察线，并且携带着标语牌举行游行。许多不属于这个工会的教员也不到学校上课。这次罢教的范围是纽约市的八百三十七所公立学校。
    一些最大的学校已被迫停课。成千的学生也支持他们的教员而罢课。这次罢教是为了要求提高各种专业教员的工资、午餐后有一个休息时间和延长病假假期。教师联合会还指责市教育局破坏了它就集体谈判、病假工资等问题上所作的诺言。
    纽约市当局企图用威胁来破坏这次罢教。纽约市教育局长锡厄博耳德扬言要援引关于禁止公务员罢工的纽约州法律来开除所有参加罢教的教员。
