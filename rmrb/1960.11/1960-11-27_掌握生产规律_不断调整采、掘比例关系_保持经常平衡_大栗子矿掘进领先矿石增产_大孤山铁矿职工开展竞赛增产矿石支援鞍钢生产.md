Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 26th: Dalianzi Iron Mine in Tonghua, Jilin Province, implements the policy of "excavation first, combining mining and excavation," enabling excavation work to consistently lead, maintaining proactive production throughout the mine, and continuously increasing ore production. From 1958 to 1960, the annual increase in ore production ranged from 60% to 112%. Since entering the fourth quarter of this year, the average daily production level to date has doubled compared to the first quarter. As of November 16th, the mine had completed 94.1% of its annual state plan for ore production, and had prepared ore reserves sufficient for twenty-four months of mining, laying a solid foundation for sustained leap forward in the coming year.

The main reason for the double harvest of mining and excavation in this iron mine is the long-term vision and solid work of the mine's Party committee. In guiding the mine's production work, the Party committee looks ahead. When arranging production plans, they consider not only the current year but also the second and third years. Based on the mine's geological conditions and the increasing demands of ore production, they implemented a "mine one, prepare two, look at three" system, meaning that after mining one working face, they prepare two more, while simultaneously starting to develop even more working faces. From January to November of this year, the mine completed mining five working faces, prepared ten working faces, and started developing dozens more.

"Mine one, prepare two, look at three" embodies the laws of mine production, meets the requirements of continuous expanded reproduction, and enables the three main steps of mine production – mining, excavation, and exploration – to advance further with each step, widening the path for ore production increase. This leads to the continuous leap forward in ore production. This year, the state's ore production plan for the mine was 61% higher than the actual production last year, but due to the preparation of sufficient reserve working faces last year, the production plans for each quarter of this year were completed on time and exceeded the targets. The implementation of "mine one, prepare two, look at three" also enables the mine to appropriately cope with various complex situations when faced with significant production tasks, maintaining proactive production throughout the mine. For example, in the second half of this year, the state required the mine to produce an additional 1,200 tons of ore per day for Anshan Iron and Steel, nearly doubling the production level of the first half of the year. The mine immediately mobilized seven high-speed mining teams, investing them in the seven prepared working faces, resulting in a rapid increase in ore production to meet Anshan's needs.

The implementation of "mine one, prepare two, look at three" requires first and foremost the establishment of a spirit of continuous revolution and continuous striving for excellence. To this end, the mine continuously organizes cadres and workers to study the laws of mine production in light of the actual production of the mine, team, and squad, and to explore the correct proportional relationship between mining and excavation. In the process of formulating and implementing production plans, they continuously opposed the "short-sightedness" in mine work, criticized the thinking and behavior of "attaching importance to mining, neglecting excavation; caring only for the present, neglecting the future."

In order to effectively implement "mine one, prepare two, look at three," the mine carried out a lot of organizational work. First, leading cadres were assigned to personally oversee excavation. The mine has one secretary, and workshops, teams, and squads have dedicated directors, squad leaders, and team leaders responsible for excavation work. Second, according to the proportional relationship between mining and excavation, manpower, equipment, and materials were rationally allocated, and a "three fixed" system of manpower, equipment, and materials was implemented, stipulating that manpower for excavation should not be transferred arbitrarily, and equipment and materials for excavation should not be used arbitrarily. Third, the mine also implemented a system of checking the progress of mining and excavation by shift, day, ten-day period, month, and quarter.

Continuously adjusting the proportional relationship between mining and excavation so that mining and excavation maintain constant balance under the conditions of high-speed leap forward is the work that this iron mine always pays attention to. From years of work experience, this iron mine has found that although the progress plans for mining and excavation are formulated proportionally, imbalances still occur under the conditions of continuous production growth, requiring timely adjustments to ensure that the amount of excavation work does not fall behind or accumulate, but always leads. For example, in the third quarter of this year, the mine's seven mining areas changed from the backward filling method to the advanced ore retention method, resulting in a sharp increase of 79% in ore production. The excavation efficiency appeared relatively slow, and the mine faced a situation where preparatory work temporarily lagged behind extraction work. The mine's Party committee convened a meeting to study this situation, and assigned the general branch secretary, workshop director, as well as geology, surveying, and mining technicians to go deep into the front line of excavation. At the same time, more than 200 laborers saved from the technical innovation movement were added to the excavation working faces, increasing the average excavation speed of each team from 50 meters per month to 70 meters per month, reversing the situation where excavation work temporarily lagged behind extraction work.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 26th: Workers at the Dagushan Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel are enthusiastically launching a competition to complete the shift production plan within the shift and not leave a "tail" for the next shift, in order to ensure the continuous rise in steel production. Drilling machine, electric shovel, and electric locomotive drivers are doing everything possible to improve efficiency in this competition. Strengthen cooperation between three shifts and between upper and lower processes to ensure the realization of daily red ore production. According to statistics, the average daily output of iron ore in the mine in mid-November increased by 32.4% compared to the first ten days of the month, powerfully supporting the leap forward in Anshan's iron and steel production.

In organizing this competition, Dagushan Iron Mine first adopted the method of assigning plans to each drilling machine, electric shovel, electric locomotive, and each team on a weekly, daily, and shift basis, so that everyone was aware of the production plan and knew the bottom line. On this basis, each shift, each machine, each group, and even each individual, found key points and proposed measures based on their own production plans, and tried every means to complete the production plan for the shift and the day. In the past twenty days, according to incomplete statistics from the blasting, mining, transportation, machinery, construction, and earth removal sections, fourteen major production key points in equipment, operation, and other aspects have been identified, and more than 400 measures have been taken to solve these key points. Geng Yulong, the driver of the No. 41 electric shovel, immediately calculated the shift production plan into an hourly production operation plan and handed it over to each driver after the plan was assigned to the machine. They found the problem that the two-car gear ring on the electric shovel often lost teeth. Driver Geng Yulong led drivers Yuan Xiwu and Ma Wanjun to come up with a solution. They added a skateboard pad to the electric shovel, greatly reducing the phenomenon of tooth loss, and increasing the efficiency of the electric shovel by 9%. At the same time, they also established a system of diligent inspection and replacement of skateboard pads, making this electric shovel produce more than the target every day, and quickly becoming an advanced electric shovel in the mine. Now, more than half of the electric shovels in the mine have caught up with and approached the production level of the No. 41 electric shovel. Some drilling machines and electric shovels that did not complete the shift plan very well in the past or were prone to leaving "tails" have now changed their face.

In order to strengthen the leadership of this movement, Party committee secretaries, mine managers, and even section chiefs at all levels, in addition to living on the mountain to help solve problems and spread advanced technology anytime and anywhere, also implemented a system of regularly grasping the production plan four times a day (i.e., at 6:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:30 PM, and 11:00 PM), carefully analyzing the problems in each production link and taking measures to solve them separately. Leading cadres at all levels directed production at various machines according to their division of labor, so that various problems hindering the completion of the shift and daily plan could be solved in time.

    掌握生产规律　不断调整采、掘比例关系　保持经常平衡
    大栗子矿掘进领先矿石增产
    大孤山铁矿职工开展竞赛增产矿石支援鞍钢生产
    本报长春26日电　吉林省通化大栗子铁矿实行“掘进先行，采、掘并举”的方针，使掘进工作步步领先，全矿生产时时主动，矿石产量不断上升。从1958年到1960年全矿矿石产量逐年增长的幅度为60％至112％；今年进入第四季度以来到目前的平均日产水平，又比第一季度增长一倍。到11月16日为止，全矿矿石产量已完成全年国家计划的94.1％，同时准备了可供二十四个月开采的备用矿量，为明年的持续跃进打下了稳固的基础。
    这个铁矿获得采掘双丰收的主要原因，是矿党委看得远，抓得扎实。党委在指导全矿生产工作中，走一步，看两步。在安排生产计划时，不仅考虑当年，也考虑到第二年和第三年。他们根据本矿的地质条件和矿石生产不断增长的要求，实行“采一、备二、看三”的制度，即采完一个工作面，就准备好两个工作面，同时再着手开拓更多的工作面。今年1月至11月，全矿采完了五个工作面，准备了十个工作面，同时还有数十个工作面正在着手开拓。
    “采一、备二、看三”，体现了矿山生产的规律，符合不断扩大再生产的要求，使采矿、掘进、勘探这三个矿山生产的主要步骤一步比一步迈得大，使矿石增产的路子越走越宽，因而就使矿石生产不断跃进。今年，国家下达给这个矿的矿石计划比去年全矿实际产量高出61％，但是由于去年为今年准备了足够的备用工作面，今年各季度的生产计划都按时超额完成。实行“采一、备二、看三”，也使这个矿在面临重大的生产任务时，能够恰当地应付各种复杂局面，使全矿生产保持主动。例如，今年下半年国家要求这个矿每天多给鞍钢生产一千二百吨矿石，比上半年的生产水平增加近一倍，全矿立即调动七个高速采矿队，投入已准备好的七个工作面，使矿石产量迅速增长，满足了鞍钢的需要。
    实行“采一、备二、看三”，首先要树立不断革命、不断争上游的思想。为此，全矿不断组织干部和工人结合本矿、本班、本队的生产实际，研究矿山生产规律，探讨采矿与掘进之间的正确比例关系。在制订和执行生产计划过程中，不断地反对了矿山工作中的“近视眼”，批判了“重视采矿，忽视掘进；只顾眼前，不顾长远”的思想和行为。
    为了切实地作好“采一、备二、看三”，全矿进行了许多组织工作。首先，调配领导干部亲自抓掘进，全矿有一名书记，车间、班、队有专职主任、班长、队长负责掘进工作。其次，根据采矿和掘进之间的比例关系，合理地配备人力、设备、材料，执行了人力、设备、材料“三固定”的制度，规定了不得随便抽调掘进的人力、不得随便动用掘进的设备和材料等项纪律。再次，全矿还执行了按班、按日、按旬、按月、按季检查采矿和掘进进度的制度。
    不断地调整采矿和掘进之间的比例关系，使采矿和掘进在高速度跃进的条件下，经常保持平衡，是这个铁矿经常注意的工作。这个铁矿从多年的工作经验中发现，采矿和掘进之间虽然按比例制订了进度计划，但是在生产不断增长的情况下，仍然会出现不平衡的现象，需要及时调整，以保证掘进工作量不欠债，不积债，永远领先。例如，今年第三季度，全矿七个采场由落后的充填法改为先进的留矿法，使矿石产量猛增79％，掘进效率相对地显得缓慢，全矿出现了准备工作暂时落后于开采工作的局面。矿党委召集党委会议研究了这个情况，调派总支书记、车间主任以及地质、测量、采矿技术员等深入掘进第一线，同时把全矿在技术革新运动中所节省下来的二百多名劳动力充实到掘进工作面，使全矿各队的平均掘进速度由月进五十延米提高到七十延米，扭转了掘进工作一时落后于开采工作的局面。
    据新华社鞍山26日电　鞍钢大孤山铁矿职工为了保证钢铁生产不断上升的需要，正在热烈开展当班生产计划当班完成、不给下班留“尾巴”的竞赛运动。穿孔机、电铲和电机车司机在这一竞赛中，千方百计地提高效率；三班之间、上下工序之间加强协作，保证实现矿石生产日日红。据统计，11月中旬全矿铁矿石的平均日产量比上旬增加了32.4％，有力地支援了鞍钢钢铁生产的跃进。
    大孤山铁矿在组织这次竞赛中，首先采取按周按日按班地把计划一一落实到每台穿孔机、电铲、电机车和每一个班组，使生产计划人人有数，个个知底，在此基础上，每个班、每个机台、每个小组直至每个人，都根据自己的生产计划找关键，提措施，千方百计完成当班当日的生产计划。近二十天来，据爆破、采矿、运输、机动、工务和排土六个工段不完全统计，已找出设备、操作等方面的重大生产关键十四项，并且采取了四百多项措施来解决这些关键。四十一号电铲司机长耿玉龙在计划落到机台后，马上把班生产计划算成小时生产作业计划交给每个司机掌握。他们找出了电铲上的二车牙轮经常掉牙的问题，司机长耿玉龙带领司机袁希武和马万均一起想办法，在电铲上加上了滑板垫，掉牙现象大大减少，电铲效率提高9％。同时他们还建立了勤检查、勤更换滑板垫的制度，使这台电铲天天超产，迅速成了全矿的先进电铲。现在，全矿有一半以上的电铲已经赶上和接近了四十一号电铲的生产水平。一些过去完成当班计划不太好或好留“尾巴”的穿孔机、电铲，现在已改变面貌。
    为了加强对这一运动的领导，矿党委书记、矿长直至工段段长等各级领导干部，除了宿住山上随时随地帮助解决问题，传播先进技术外，还实行了一天定期抓四次生产计划的制度（即早六点、中午十一点、下午三点三十分、夜十一点各抓一次），认真分析各个生产环节的问题，采取措施分别解决。各级领导干部按照分工到各机台指挥生产，使阻碍完成当班当日计划的各种问题都及时得到解决。（附图片）
