    Singing the Strongest Voice of the Era
    -- Reflections After Reading Several Feature Articles Reflecting Communist Style
    Song Shuang
    For nearly a hundred years, whether in the East or the West, whether in the fiery struggle against imperialism and colonialism, or in countries building socialist mansions, whether in prison, on the way to the execution ground, or in the mighty ranks of defending peace and opposing wars of aggression, "The Internationale" has always maintained its powerful, captivating force. Every time we sing it, we seem to gain wings for a tiger, and our whole body suddenly gains infinite strength. It was like this in the past, and it is still like this now. Because whether in the past or now, the chains that imperialism and colonialism put around the necks of the working class and other working people have not been completely and thoroughly shattered. As long as imperialism and colonialism exist for one day, the singing of "The Internationale" will never cease. "The Internationale" -- it is the strongest voice of the entire proletarian revolutionary era.
    Since breaking the old state machinery in 1949, the people of our country, who have been rapidly building a socialist mansion for eleven years, have never forgotten that every brick and tile of our construction is accumulating strength to bury the old world and create a new world. All is for the purpose of sweeping away the evil forces of imperialism and colonialism from the earth, and to accelerate our own construction speed day and night in order to eliminate all classes, all exploitation, and all phenomena of human oppression, so as to increasingly strengthen the revolutionary forces of the international proletariat. All the content of our revolutionary literature, which helps people understand and transform the world, also serves this great purpose.
    Singing the strongest voice of our era, expressing the will of the working class and the working people, and portraying and shaping brand-new heroic figures are the common wishes of the people of our country and the peace-loving people of all countries opposing colonialism headed by U.S. imperialism. Because people will find in genuine revolutionary literary works the power to always encourage themselves to forge ahead, like "The Internationale."
    Judging from a batch of news reports and feature articles recently published in newspapers and periodicals by some of our writers and journalists – in my opinion – they are diligently carrying forward the fighting spirit of the author of "The Internationale," attempting to enrich the spiritual life of our era with brand-new themes, brand-new characters, and brand-new tones, and to ignite the raging fire of millions of people transforming the old society and creating a new world. This writing trend is inspiring. It should be said that a batch of news reports and feature articles that boost the morale of the working class and diminish the prestige of imperialism have also emerged.
    In my opinion, "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" written by a reporter from *China Youth Daily* (see *China Youth Daily*, February 28, 1960) and "Salute to People with Lofty Communist Style" collectively written by reporters and correspondents of *Southern Daily* (see *People's Daily*, March 15, 1960) are two such good works full of ideology and combativeness.
    "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" tells the story of sixty-one ordinary laborers in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, who suffered food poisoning and were on the verge of death, but were finally rescued under the leadership of the Party. Laborers being poisoned might constitute a tragic news item in the "free world" of the West, placed in the corner of the newspaper, but it would not receive the attention of any "humanitarian" or "dog-itarian" gentlemen and ladies. If it did, it would only be "a tiger wearing a rosary" -- pretending to be a good person. Isn't the number of people struggling on the front lines of unemployment, disease, and death increasing day by day in imperialist countries? "You are enslaved nations" and "We are the free world," the imperialists and their echoing worms shout every day. Not long ago, Eisenhower even launched some "Enslaved Nations Week," determined to be enemies of the people of socialist countries. However, one hand cannot cover the sun. Let's see how we treat sixty-one ordinary laborers.
    The people of our country, who have been liberated from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism, firmly believe in this truth: the Communist Party is the sun of the working people. Under the shining of this sun, every ordinary laborer can proudly say: "I am the master of the new society!" Yes, our 650 million people are building a paradise on earth in the posture of masters of the new society, moving bricks and transporting materials. Unfortunately, sixty-one ordinary laborers suffered food poisoning. Rescue them! Thus, a miracle occurred that even the imperialists and their running dogs could not dream of: for the lives of sixty-one ordinary laborers, many unrelated and unfamiliar organizations and individuals rushed to help. The pharmacist trekked through the night, the old boatman broke the rule and ferried across the Yellow River at night, the air force overcame numerous difficulties such as dangerous mountains, unfamiliar terrain, no airdrop field, and no air-to-ground communication. Employees of the special medicine store gave up the Spring Festival gala that only occurred once a year... What does this miracle mean? We should thank our reporters. Our reporters not only accurately, quickly, vividly, and lively wrote about the entire moving deeds of the Pinglu incident, but also sang the strongest voice of our era:
    "The hearts of the people turn to Beijing, and the heart of Beijing immediately beats with the heart of Pinglu..." "Class friendship is deeper than the sea. Among us, when one person encounters difficulties, hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of strangers kindly extend their hands to you and help you with all their might." "It is not just these sixty-one people who have been brought back to life, no, each of us has two lives. The Party uses the sunlight of its thoughts to help us eliminate the ideological bacteria left over from the old era and nurture us to become brand new people!"
    The authors of the news reports and feature articles "Salute to People with Lofty Communist Style" and "Su Manji" reflected the same moving deeds and sang the same strongest voice -- the heroic behavior and brand-new spiritual outlook of forty-nine public security cadres and people's police in rescuing the fire at the Makou Paper Mill in Yingde County, Guangdong Province. How could they not know the power of the raging flames, how could they not know that death cannot be reversed, but state property is more important than personal life, collective interests are greater than individual interests. They jumped in, one by one, like phoenixes, flying into the sea of fire... Su Manji, a "five-good policeman," was burned by the fire and lay in the hospital. How could he not feel the burning pain, but this could not conquer the heart of a hero. In the moment before his death, he still remembered his work, and instructed his closest comrade-in-arms, Yan Jinxing: "We may have to say goodbye forever, you must complete the cultural and educational work. You have to listen to the Party!" What a brave warrior, what a great man!
    Dare I ask Eisenhower, have you ever dreamed that there would be such awe-inspiring "slaves" in the "enslaved nations"? It seems that it is you who have not escaped the status of a slave, because you have never dared to say a true word against the will of your Wall Street bosses.
    The East wind prevails over the West wind. Guo Chaoren's series of news reports and feature articles, "Days and Nights in Mount Everest," "Heroes Ascend the Top of the Earth," "Selfless Mountaineering Hero Liu Lianman," and many other news reports and feature articles written by other reporters about climbing Mount Everest, once again deepened people's impression.
    Were Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, and Gonbu previously well-known and great mountaineering "explorers"? No. They were just ordinary geological workers, just the sons of lumberjacks in the deep mountains and old forests, just slaves who were arbitrarily whipped and had their eyes gouged out by slave owners. However, who would have expected that it was these so-called "sick men of East Asia" who were oppressed at the bottom by imperialism and feudalism, who, under the shining of the socialist system and the light of Mao Zedong Thought, like the sun rising through the darkness, suddenly illuminated the entire world and gained global fame.
    People praise them and award them the most beautiful laurel wreaths. Is it only because they climbed to the top of the earth, opened up heroic paths for the cultural and scientific activities of the entire progressive human race, and brought the greatest pride and pride? No. What is even more worthy of celebration by all oppressed nations is that they sang the strongest voice of our era in an exciting and soaring tone.
    We have not forgotten that those imperialist and colonialist elements who have always regarded the oppressed nations of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as poor, backward, and barbaric have repeatedly arrogantly declared their "civilization." Where is their "civilization" manifested? Let's take mountaineering activities as an example. Eric Shipton, a British "explorer" who had twice climbed Mount Everest and failed twice, once said: "Only a saint does not have the desire to hope that his companion will fall ill and let him take his place and enjoy the honor of reaching the summit alone." Francis Younghusband, who led the British army to occupy Lhasa in 1904 and was elected President of the Royal Geographical Society in 1919, was also keen on climbing Mount Everest and revealed the purpose of this activity in his book "Adventures on the Eiffel Peak" in 1936: "To attract the world's attention to the Himalayas," "because in those mountains, infinite treasures may be discovered." A colonialist element of the British Empire, far away from the Chinese mainland, came with an army to discover the infinite treasures of the Tibetan mountains. Isn't his ulterior motive obvious? Wearing the gorgeous cloak of an "explorer," he engaged in despicable and dirty deeds; attempting to "enjoy the honor of reaching the summit alone" and seize the patent for "infinite treasures." This is their so-called "civilization." However, it is much more difficult to stand at a height of 8,882 meters and show off than to use machine guns and cannons to spread their "civilization," so until now, they can only drool at the mountain and be helpless.
    In sharp contrast to the "civilization" of all imperialism and colonialism, all our cultural and scientific activities serve the cause of socialist construction, fight to transform nature for the benefit of mankind, and fight for all oppressed people to stand tall in the cultural and scientific fields. Great ideals give birth to great perseverance, and great perseverance bursts out with "miraculous" spiritual power. Our mountaineering team put forward such a slogan: "Give the last drop of water to the collective, and use the left hand to help comrades when the right hand is broken." A mountaineer wrote such a vow in his diary: "I will unconditionally contribute all my life and blood to the collective, so that the insignificant individual can emit light and heat in the great collective." It was this combination of communist spirit of "everything for the collective, everything for comrades" and self-sacrifice and selflessness that composed a heart-stirring song of collectivism in the entire process of climbing the world's summit.
    Not to mention those who have silently made brilliant achievements in predicting the weather, transporting supplies, and scouting routes for mountaineering athletes. How touching is their truly saintly mind and spirit, which has no desire for fame or gain and no personal plans (their mind and spirit will be recorded in the world's mountaineering history and will shine forever). Let's just look at the heroic deeds of Wang Fuzhou, Qu Yinhua, Gonbu, and Liu Lianman, who stormed the summit: They overcame numerous difficulties, got rid of various dangers, and came to the famous "Second Step" on the north slope of Mount Everest. The "Second Step" is like a city wall, blocking their way. This is a steep cliff, located between 8,570 meters and 8,600 meters above sea level, with almost no support points for climbing. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the famous British mountaineers Mallory and Irvine lost their lives in this area in 1924. The British "expedition" later concluded that the "Second Step" was "a great obstacle, and there is no need to waste time climbing it." Facing the "Second Step" and facing this "conclusion," the heroes did not stop. They braved the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius, braved the high mountain wind of about 12 degrees, braved the danger of losing their lives with every step, gritted their teeth, and insisted on moving forward on the steep and slippery rock wall. When approaching the top of the "Second Step," the rock wall became vertical and smooth again in the last three meters. Liu Lianman used the method of building a "human ladder," squatting at the bottom of the rock crevice, letting his comrades step on his shoulders and climb up one by one... When they reached a height of 8,700 meters above sea level, the oxygen was even less and the action was more difficult. At this time, they held a Party group meeting on this slope called the "death zone" by the Western mountaineering community. Wang Fuzhou said excitedly: "Climbing to the top is the task assigned to us by the Party. We must move forward even without oxygen!" Qu Yinhua said: "If I retreat now, what face do I have to go back and see the Party as a Communist Party member?" Liu Lianman also firmly stated: "I can't leave, I have to climb up!" The Party group took into account Liu Lianman's physical condition and decided to let him stay to save time, and the remaining three people would move towards the summit as quickly as possible. Liu Lianman obeyed the Party's decision, and the remaining three people, with the great courage of communists, broke through the cold and snow, despised the steep cliffs, and endured the headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, and weakness caused by severe hypoxia at high altitudes. Step by step, they finally reached the summit of 8,882 meters above sea level at 4:20 on May 25, 1960. People cheered for this unprecedented miracle, and even more cheered for this song of collectivism composed by the heroes' great courage and great virtue. Liu Lianman did not reach the summit, but he also sang extremely moving deeds in this song: he obeyed the decision of the Party group at a height of 8,700 meters and stayed. As a mountaineer, he lost the opportunity to reach the summit, which was only more than 100 meters away. Naturally, he felt sad. But what he considered was not "enjoying the honor of reaching the summit alone," but "everything must start from the collective victory." So, at a height of 8,700 meters, Liu Lianman bravely took off the oxygen cylinder. He knew that he might die if he did not breathe oxygen for one night, and he was afraid that his comrades would not know that there were still dozens of liters of oxygen in the oxygen cylinder, so he took out his notebook and wrote these lines to Wang Fuzhou: "Comrade Wang Fuzhou: I have not completed the arduous task assigned to me by the Party and the people of the motherland. I am sorry for the Party and the people of the motherland. Let the task be completed by you three! I know I can't do it anymore. I see there is still some oxygen in the oxygen cylinder, leave it for you three to use when you come back, maybe it will work. Your comrade Liu Lianman."
    What kind of heroic figures, what kind of heroic spirit! Confucius said: "Climbing Mount Tai makes the world seem small." After hearing this complete and inspiring song of collectivism sung by the heroes, looking down on the "civilization" advocated by imperialism and colonialism, how despicable, how dirty, and how insignificant it seems! This song of collectivism -- the song sung by the heroes nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, is the dawn of Eastern civilization, a red sun about to burst forth, it will illuminate the entire earth with the light of thousands of rays of sunshine, warming and encouraging the pride and self-confidence of all oppressed nations: sweeping away the rule of imperialism and colonialism from the earth like sweeping away garbage, it is possible to create all the miracles that predecessors could not create.
    In our era, the joyful scenes of life and the new people and new things that make people "spirited and high-spirited" are like blooming flowers everywhere. Every flower exudes the fragrance of the era and radiates a strength that refreshes the heart and lungs. From the two feature articles and news reports "Xing Yanzi" (see *China Youth Daily*, September 17, 1960) and "Persistently Learning Science and Dedicated to Building the Countryside" (see *People's Daily*, September 5, 1960), we can see the glorious achievements of rural intellectuals in our country, and how they inspire people and make people think deeply.
    Like the heroes who climbed Mount Everest, rural intellectuals like Xing Yanzi and He Wenyi have drawn amazing strength and unparalleled wisdom from the sunshine of the Party and Mao Zedong Thought, and from the great and lofty virtues of revolutionary predecessors who were born and died. In ordinary labor life, in breaking with old ideas, in declaring war on nature, and in fighting against various dangers and difficulties, they also sang the strongest voice of our era -- the great communist style of striving for self-improvement, working hard, being selfless, and dedicating themselves to creating a new life.
    Xing Yanzi -- a 20-year-old member of the Communist Youth League, the captain of the "Yanzi Commando Team," and an ordinary rural girl on the banks of the Jiyun River, in order to change the face of the poor team, listened to the Party, was not afraid of the various difficulties brought about by the severe natural disasters last year, did not fear the cold words and sarcasm of the old-fashioned people, resolutely stayed in the countryside, worked diligently and thriftily, worked hard, united the vast number of young people, and worked with the people of the whole village to overcome the disaster and make great achievements in developing production. He Wenyi -- also a member of the Communist Youth League of about 20 years old, a young man who could not even recognize a chemical symbol two years ago, encouraged by the three red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, worked hard and fiercely, attacked the scientific fortress, and manufactured and invented 117 kinds of various chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemical crafts. …
    Do you say that these are new people and new things that make people happy? Certainly so. However, what makes people admire, remember, and regard them as models for learning is the flame of the newest and most beautiful spirit of the era that rises from their heroic achievements.
    Look at Xing Yanzi, in the autumn of last year, when Sijiazhuang suffered from waterlogging disasters and most of the team's more than 1,000 mu of crops were flooded, when there were a few people who were not at ease with agricultural production and wanted to take the opportunity to sneak into the city to find work, when most of her family members were working in the city and her family members heard that the village had suffered a disaster and wrote to her asking her to go to the city to find work, she, listening to the Party's words, looked at the branch secretary with bright eyes and said: "I will resolutely stay in the countryside and dedicate my youth to changing the poor face of our village and building a new socialist and communist countryside." The season for ice fishing has arrived. During the period when she led the women's team to ice fish as an exception, some people who discriminated against women ridiculed and attacked them with cold words, saying "Look, you will have to freeze back from the ice!" Yanzi said: "In order to overcome the disaster, we are not afraid of any difficulties, others think we can't do it, we must do a good job in production!" So they fished during the day and lit horse lamps to weave reed curtains at night; they sowed spring wheat in the cold weather, and after sowing spring wheat, they reclaimed wasteland... In the battle against the severe cold and fatigue, in the battle to get grain from the wasteland, countless "enemies" of hardships and difficulties came one after another, but they were helplessly defeated in front of them. What they got was the fruitful results of overcoming the disaster, and what spread in all directions was the thunderous voice of Xing Yanzi's determination to improve herself and work hard: "We are a commando team, and we should go to charge when there are difficulties," "Please give the most difficult tasks to the commando team, we guarantee to complete the tasks on time!"
    "My future is here!" "There are no uncrackable sesame stalks!" This is the voice of He Wenyi. He led the Communist Youth League to start a chemical plant from scratch, did the most difficult and dirty things himself, went to every household early in the morning to pour out urine pots and clean latrines, and searched everywhere for dead cats, rotten rats, and various bones as if looking for gold. His wife disliked him for being dirty, did not allow him to enter the house, did not eat at the same table with him, and did not wash his clothes for him, saying: "Look at you, you only do these things when you are the secretary of the League branch?" He replied: "This is the glorious task given to me by the Party!" His wife said: "Glory? No one will wash your clothes for you!" He Wenyi laughed: "If no one washes them, I will wash them myself, there are no uncrackable sesame stalks!" Since then, he "went to heaven and earth" to find bones, and asked teachers for advice to make bacterial fertilizers. The "peaks" of science stand, but he is like a "lumberjack," raising the mountain-splitting axe of hard study, hard work, and hard experimentation, and chopping them down one by one. He studied in school for three days, and learned everything from inoculation to solid culture, liquid culture, sterilization, and bacterial liquid mixing. The mystery of bacteria was revealed. He went back and experimented immediately. There was no incubator, refrigerator, platinum inoculation loop, inoculation tube, sterilizer... He relied on his own efforts and used "native" methods instead of foreign ones... Finally, they made the first batch of finished products, so that a teacher Wang who had initially looked down on him and refused to let him visit the bacterial production room had to secretly nod his head in admiration: "It is true that seawater cannot be measured." At present, this He Wenyi, who cannot be measured by seawater, has not only started a Communist Youth League fertilizer plant from scratch, from nothing to something, from small to large, but also his revolutionary spirit of daring to carry out a series of creations and experiments, not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of hardships, working hard, and being indomitable, like the 117 kinds of chemical fertilizers, bacterial fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemical crafts that he successfully trial-produced, radiates a brilliant light in front of us.
    However, whether it is Xing Yanzi or He Wenyi, they have always attributed every bit of their achievements on their way forward to the Party and the people, and they are never satisfied with their existing achievements. They must always maintain a sincere and humble attitude, and maintain the strength to move forward and forge ahead bravely. He Wenyi said: "The Party and the people have cultivated me and given me such great honor, but science is a vast ocean. I have not studied for a few days, so I must work hard!" These simple and sincere words are like sparks from steel colliding. It is hoped that these sparks will ignite the hearts of thousands of rural intellectuals, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of ambition and hard work, dedicate their beautiful youth to the motherland, and write a magnificent chapter in the history of the construction of the people's communes in the countryside of the motherland. Let all the oppressed brothers see it and feel proud and encouraged; let all imperialists and their echoing worms see it and be stunned and terrified!
    Singing the strongest voice of the era, composing the strongest notes that are enough to capture people's hearts and never tire of singing like "The Internationale," should be said to still be the goal of our news reports and feature articles. In addition to the above-mentioned and unmentioned excellent works, a number of news reports and feature articles that have appeared in newspapers and periodicals recently have also attracted attention, or excitingly reflected the new people and new things in our real struggle life, but have not yet "played" the strongest voice of the era. As long as our writers and reporters stand tall, look far, are willing to plunge into the real struggle life, are willing to diligently study and use Mao Zedong Thought to observe, study, and analyze real life, and dare to use the courage of revolutionaries to pave the way for new things, it is possible to write more and better news reports and feature articles, and it is possible to play the newest and most beautiful notes of the era, from which one inspiring song after another of communist style will surely be produced. I look forward to it with full confidence.

    唱出时代的最强音
    ——几篇反映共产主义风格的通讯特写读后
    宋爽
    近百年来，无论在东方或西方，无论在火热的反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争中，还是在兴建社会主义大厦的国度里，无论是在监狱，在走向刑场途中，还是在保卫和平、反对侵略战争的浩浩荡荡的队伍里，《国际歌》，始终保持着它强大的摄取人心的力量。我们每唱一遍，就好像虎添双翼，浑身骤增无穷的力量，过去是这样，现在还是这样。因为无论过去和现在，帝国主义、殖民主义套在工人阶级和其他劳动人民脖子上的锁链，还没有被全部彻底粉碎。只要帝国主义、殖民主义存在一天，《国际歌》的歌声就会永远不断。《国际歌》——它是整个无产阶级革命时代的最强音。
    从1949年打碎了旧的国家机器，十一年来在飞快地兴建社会主义大厦的我国人民，始终没有忘记我们一砖一瓦的建设，都是为埋葬旧世界、创建新世界积蓄力量，都是为了从地球上扫除帝国主义、殖民主义恶势力，为争取消灭一切阶级、一切剥削、一切人压迫人的现象而不分日夜地加快自己的建设速度，以便与日俱增地壮大国际无产阶级的革命力量。作为帮助人民认识世界、改造世界的我国革命文学的全部内容，也是为了这个伟大的目的服务的。
    歌唱我们这个时代的最强音，抒发工人阶级和劳动人民的意志，描绘和塑造全新的英雄人物，是我国人民，也是全世界反对以美帝国主义为首的殖民主义的各国爱好和平的人民的一致愿望。因为人们会从真正的革命文学作品中，找到像《国际歌》那样永远激励自己奋勇前进的力量。
    从我们的一部分作家和从事新闻工作的记者最近在报刊上发表的一批通讯、特写来看，他们——在我看来——正在勤奋地发扬《国际歌》作者那样的战斗精神，企图以全新的题材、全新的人物、全新的音调来丰富我们这个时代的精神生活，来点燃千百万人民改造旧社会、创立新世界的熊熊烈火。这种写作的趋向，令人振奋。应该说，也出现了一批长工人阶级志气、灭帝国主义威风的通讯、特写。
    我觉得，《中国青年报》记者写的《为了六十一个阶级弟兄》（见《中国青年报》1960年2月28日）以及《南方日报》记者和通讯员集体采写的《向具有崇高共产主义风格的人致敬》（见《人民日报》1960年3月15日），就是这样两篇富有思想性、战斗性的佳作。
    《为了六十一个阶级弟兄》，写的是山西省平陆县六十一名普通劳动者食物中毒，生命危在旦夕，终于在党的抢救下解危。劳动者中毒，这在西方“自由世界”也许会构成一条放在报屁股上的悲惨性的新闻消息，但不会有什么标榜“人道主义”“狗道主义”的老爷和太太们的理睬，偶然有之，也不过是“老虎挂素珠”——假充善人而已。难道在帝国主义国家内挣扎在失业、疾病和死亡战线上的人数不是一天天在增加吗？“你们是被奴役的国家”“我们是自由世界”，帝国主义者及其应声虫天天这样叫喊，喊之不足，前不久艾森豪威尔还发动一个什么“被奴役的国家周”，死心与社会主义国家人民为敌。然而一手遮不住太阳，且看我们怎样对待六十一名普通的劳动者吧。
    从帝国主义、封建主义桎梏中解放了的我国人民，对这样一个道理深信不疑：共产党是劳动人民的太阳。在这个太阳的光辉照耀下，每一个普通的劳动者都可以这样自豪地说：“我是新社会的主人！”是的，我国六亿五千万人民正是以新社会的主人的姿态在搬砖运料，兴建人间的天堂。不幸六十一名普通劳动者食物中毒了。抢救！于是就出现了连帝国主义者及其走狗们作梦也梦不到的奇迹：为了六十一个普通劳动者的生命，许多素不相关、素不相识的机关单位和个人，奔忙起来了，司药员星夜跋涉，老船工破例夜渡黄河，空军克服了山峦险恶、地形生疏、没有空投场和对空联络等重重困难，特种药品商店职工放弃了一年只有一度的春节联欢……这种奇迹意味着什么呢？应该感谢我们的记者。我们的记者不但准确迅速、生动活泼地写出了平陆事件的这一全部的动人事迹，也唱出了我们这个时代的最强音：
  “人心向北京，北京的心立刻和平陆的心一起跳动……”“阶级友爱，情深似海。在我们中间，一个人发生困难，就有上百、上千、上万个素不相识的人，亲切地向你伸出手，不遗余力地帮助你”，“不仅仅是这六十一个死而复生的人，不，我们每个人都有两次生命。党用它思想的阳光，帮助我们消除旧时代遗留给我们的思想毒菌，抚育我们成为全新的人！”
    《向具有崇高共产主义风格的人致敬》和《苏满基》这两篇通讯、特写的作者，反映了同样的动人事迹，唱出了同样的最强音——四十九名公安干部和人民警察在抢救广东省英德县马口造纸厂火灾事件中的英雄行为和全新的精神面貌。他们何尝不知烈焰的厉害，何尝不晓死而不能复生，但是，国家财产重于个人生命，集体利益大于个人利益，跳进去，一个个像火凤凰一样飞进了火海……。“五好警士”苏满基被烈火烧伤，躺在医院，他何尝不知灼痛，但这征服不了英雄的心，就在他与世长辞前的片刻，还念念不忘工作，这样叮嘱他最亲密的战友严金兴：“我们恐怕要永别了，文化教育工作由你来完成。你得听党的话呵！”这是何等勇敢的战士，何等伟大的人！
    敢问艾森豪威尔，你曾梦见过“被奴役国家”里竟有如此浩然正气的“奴隶”么？看来没有摆脱奴隶地位的恰恰是阁下，因为阁下从来不敢违背你华尔街老板的意志说一句真话。
    东风压倒西风。郭超人写的一组《珠穆朗玛山中的日日夜夜》、《英雄登上地球之巅》、《舍己为人的登山英雄刘连满》和其他记者写的不少有关攀登珠穆朗玛峰的通讯、特写，再一次加深了人们这样的印象。
    王富洲、屈银华、贡布，从前是赫赫有名的伟大的登山“探险家”吗？不是。只不过是普通的地质工作者，只不过是深山老林伐木工人的儿子，只不过是被奴隶主任意鞭打、挖眼睛的奴隶。然而，谁能料到，正是这些被帝国主义、封建主义压在最底层的所谓“东亚病夫”，在社会主义制度和毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，像冲破黑暗而升腾起来的太阳，一下子照亮了整个世界，誉满全球。
    人们歌颂他们，把最美丽的荣誉花冠授予他们，难道仅在于他们登上了地球之巅，为整个进步人类的文化科学活动开辟了英雄道路、带来了最大的自豪和骄傲？不是。更值得一切被压迫的民族欢呼的是：他们以激越高昂的音调，唱出了我们时代的最强音。
    我们没有忘记，那些一向把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各被压迫民族视为贫穷、落后、野蛮的帝国主义、殖民主义分子，一再趾高气扬地宣称他们的“文明”。他们的“文明”表现在甚么地方呢？且以登山活动为例。曾经两次攀登珠穆朗玛两次失败而归的英国“探险家”埃里克·希普敦说过一句话：“只有圣人才不怀有这样的愿望：盼望他的同伴病倒而让自己取而代之，独享登上顶峰的荣誉”。另一位在1904年率领英军占据拉萨、1919年膺英国皇家地理学会会长之选的佛兰西斯·荣赫鹏，也曾热中于攀登珠穆朗玛峰的活动，并在1936年在他所著的《埃非尔峰探险记》一书中透露了这一活动目的：“把世人的注意吸引到喜玛拉雅山”，“因为在那些山里，无限的宝藏可能被发现。”一个远离中国大陆的大不列颠帝国的殖民主义分子，带着军队前来发现西藏群山的无限宝藏，其司马昭之心，不是昭然若揭了吗？披着“探险家”的华丽外衣，干着卑鄙龌龊的勾当；企图“独享登上顶峰的荣誉”，攫取“无限宝藏”的专利，这就是他们的所谓“文明”。然而想站在8，882米的高度耀武扬威，到底要比借机枪大炮传布他们的“文明”难得多，所以直到现在，他们只能望山垂涎，束手无策。
    与一切帝国主义、殖民主义的“文明”针锋相对，我们的一切文化科学活动都为社会主义建设事业服务，都为变大自然为人类谋福利而战，为一切被压迫的人民定要在文化科学领域内扬眉吐气而战。伟大的理想诞生伟大的毅力，伟大的毅力迸发出了“奇迹”式的精神力量。我国登山队员提出了这样的口号：“把最后一口水让给集体，右手坏了用左手帮助同志。”一位登山队员在日记本上写下了这样的誓言：“我要把生命鲜血无条件地全部贡献给集体，让微不足道的个人在伟大的集体中发出光和热。”正是这种“一切为了集体，一切为了同志”的雄心壮志和自我牺牲、舍己为人相结合的共产主义精神，在攀登世界顶峰的全部过程中，谱出了一曲激荡人心的集体主义凯歌。
    且不说那些默默无闻的为登山健将预测天气、运输物资、侦察道路方面立下光辉业绩的人们。他们那种毫无名利之心、毫无个人打算的真正圣人般的胸襟气魄（他们这种胸襟气魄将被载入世界登山史而永放光辉），是怎样动人。我们单看一看突击顶峰的王富洲、屈银华、贡布、刘连满的英勇事迹吧：他们越过重重困难，摆脱种种艰险，来到了珠穆朗玛峰北坡上驰名的“第二台阶”下。“第二台阶”就像城墙一样，拦阻着他们的去路。这是一道陡峭的悬岩绝壁，坐落在拔海8，570米到8，600 米之间，几乎找不到任何便于攀援的支撑点。据大英百科全书记载，1924年英国登山界赫赫有名的登山家马洛里和欧文，就曾在这一带丧失生命。英国“探险队”后来对“第二台阶”作出结论说：“这是一个很大的障碍，再也不必浪费时间去爬它了。”面对“第二台阶”，面对这种“结论”，英雄们没有止步，他们冒着摄氏零下三十度的严寒，冒着十二级左右的高山风，冒着每走一步就有丧失生命的危险，咬着牙，在陡滑的岩壁上坚持前进。在接近
  “第二台阶”顶部最后约三米的地方时，岩壁又变得垂直而光滑。刘连满采用搭“人梯”的办法，蹲在岩缝底下，让战友们踏着自己的双肩，一个个爬了上去……当他们来到拔海8，700米的高度时，氧气更少了，行动更加艰难。这时，他们在这被西方登山界称作“死亡地带”的山坡上，举行了党的小组会。王富洲激动地说：“登上顶峰是党交给我们的任务，没有氧也要前进！”屈银华说：“如果现在就后退，我这个共产党员有什么脸回去见党呢？”刘连满也坚决表示：“不能走，爬也要爬上去！”党小组考虑到刘连满的身体，同时为了争取时间，决定让他留下来，其余三人以尽快的速度向顶峰前进。刘连满服从了党的决定，其余三人以共产主义者的大勇，冲破严寒风雪，藐视陡壁悬崖，忍住由于高山严重缺氧而带来的头痛、眼花、气喘、无力，一步又一步，一步又一步，他们终于在1960年5月25日4时20分到达了拔海8，882米的顶峰。人们欢呼这个史无前例的奇迹，更欢呼由英雄们的大勇大德谱成的这首集体主义的凯歌。刘连满没有登上顶峰，但他在这首凯歌中同样唱出了极为动人的事迹：他在拔海8，700米的高度服从党小组的决定留下来，作为一个登山运动员，失去了只差100多米就能登上顶峰的机会，自然心里是难过的。但他考虑的不是什么“独享登上顶峰的荣誉”，而是“一切要从集体的胜利出发”。于是，在8，700米的高度上，刘连满英勇地摘下了氧气瓶。他知道一夜不吸一口氧气可能死去，又怕后来的同志们不知道氧气瓶里还有几十公升氧，自己便拿出笔记本，给王富洲写下了这样几行：“王富洲同志：我没有完成党和祖国人民交给我的艰巨任务，我对不起党和祖国人民，任务交给你们三人完成吧！我知道我不行了，我看氧气瓶里还有点氧，留给你们三人回来用，也许管用。你们的同志刘连满。”
    什么样的英雄人物，什么样的英雄气概！孔子曰：“登泰山而小天下。”当我们听了英雄们唱出的这一曲完整而激荡人心的集体主义凯歌之后，俯视帝国主义、殖民主义所鼓吹的“文明”，显得何等可卑，何等龌龊，何等渺小！这一曲集体主义的凯歌——在毛泽东思想抚育下英雄们唱出来的凯歌，是东方文明的曙光，一轮喷薄欲出的红日，它将以万道彩霞的光芒照射整个大地，温暖着、鼓舞着一切被压迫民族的自豪心和自信心：像扫垃圾一样从地球上扫除帝国主义、殖民主义的统治，就能够创造出一切前人所不能创造的奇迹。
    在我们的时代里，令人欢欣的生活图景，令人“意气风发，斗志昂扬”的新人新事，有如遍地开花，俯拾即是。每一朵花，都吐露着时代的芬芳，散发着沁人肺腑的力量。我们从《邢燕子》（见《中国青年报》1960年9月17日）和《坚韧学习科学，一心建设农村》（见《人民日报》1960年9月5日）这两篇特写、通讯里，就可以看到我国农村知识青年的光荣业绩，又是怎样激励人心，引人深思不已。
    和攀登珠穆朗玛峰的英雄们一样，邢燕子、何文义式的农村知识青年，从党和毛泽东思想的阳光中，从革命先辈出生入死的伟大而崇高的品德中，汲取了惊人的力量和无比的智慧。他们在普通的劳动生活中，在与旧的思想决裂，在与大自然宣战、与各种艰险困难的搏斗中，同样唱出了我们时代的最强音——发愤图强，埋头苦干，舍己为人，为开创新生活而献身的伟大的共产主义风格。
    邢燕子——一个蓟运河岸二十岁的共青团员、“燕子突击队”队长、普通的农村姑娘，为了改变穷队面貌，听党的话，不怕去年严重自然灾害带来的种种困难，不畏守旧人的冷言讥语，坚决留在农村，克勤克俭，埋头苦干，团结广大青年，和全村人民一起，战胜灾荒，为发展生产作出了巨大成绩。何文义——也是一个不过二十岁左右的共青团员，两年前连一个化学符号都认不得的小伙子，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的鼓舞下，苦钻猛干，力攻科学堡垒，制造和发明了各种化肥、菌肥、农药及其他化学工艺品一百一十七种。……
    你说这是让人欢天喜地的新人新事吗？诚然如此。然而让人钦佩，铭刻在心和把他们奉为学习典范的，是从他们的英雄业绩中升腾起来的最新最美的时代精神的火焰。
    请看邢燕子，她在去年秋天司家庄遭受沥水灾害、全队一千多亩庄稼绝大部分被水淹没了的情况下，在有几个原来就不安心农业生产、想乘机溜进城市找工作的人的情况下，在一家人大部分都在城市里工作，家里人听说村里遭了灾来信叫她进城找工作的情况下，她，听了党的话，闪着明亮的眼睛望着支部书记说：“我坚决留在农村，为改变咱村贫穷面貌，为建设社会主义、共产主义新农村，献出我的青春。”冰上治鱼的季节到了。在她领导妇女队破例冰上治鱼期间，有些歧视妇女的人冷言冷语讽刺她们，打击她们，说什么“看吧，到冰上就得冻回来！”燕子说：“为了战胜灾荒，困难再大也不怕，别人认为咱们不行，咱们就非把生产搞好了不可！”于是白天治鱼，夜里点上马灯打苇帘；天寒地冻播种春麦，种完春麦又开荒……。在与严寒、疲劳搏斗中，在向荒洼要粮的战斗中，数不尽的艰苦困难的“敌人”接踵而来，但在她们面前又无可奈何地纷纷败退而去。得来的是战胜了灾荒的果实累累，传播四方的是邢燕子发愤图强、艰苦奋斗滚雷般的声音：“我们是突击队，有困难的时候，应该去打冲锋”，“请支部把最艰苦的任务交给突击队，我们保证按时完成任务！”
      “我的前途就在这里！”“那有破不开的芝麻秆！”这是何文义的声音。他领导共青团白手起家办化工厂，拣最苦、最肮脏的事情自己做，每天清早挨家挨户去倒尿盆、掏茅厕，像找金子似地四处搜寻死猫烂老鼠和各种骨头。妻子嫌他脏，不许他进房子，不跟他一桌吃饭，不给他洗衣服，说：“你看你，当团支书就弄这些事呀？”他答：“这是党给的光荣任务！”妻子说：“光荣？衣服没人给你洗！”何文义笑了：“没人洗我自己洗，那有破不开的芝麻秆！”此后，他“上天入地”找骨头，拜师求经要搞细菌肥料，科学上的“珠峰”林立，但他却像“伐木工人”，举起苦学、苦钻、苦试验的劈山斧，一个个地劈下去。在学校学了三天，从接种到固体培养、液体培养、灭菌、菌液拌合都学会了，细菌的神秘揭开了。回去马上试验。没有温箱，冰箱，白金接种环，接种管，灭菌器，……自力更生，以“土”代洋……终于，他们制成了第一批成品，使得最初曾经瞧不起并拒绝他参观制菌室的一位王老师也不得不暗自点头佩服：“真是海水不可斗量。”目前，这位“海水不可斗量”的何文义，不仅赤手空拳、从无到有、从小到大，办起了一个共青团化肥厂，他那种敢于进行一系列的创造和试验，不畏艰险、不怕困苦、埋头苦干、百折不挠的不断革命精神，像他试制成功的一百一十七种化肥、菌肥、农药及其他化学工艺品一样，在我们眼前同样放射出了绚丽的光彩。
    然而不论是邢燕子，还是何文义，他们从来就把自己前进途中一点一滴的业绩归功于党和人民，从来不满足于已有的成就，要永远保持着诚恳谦虚的态度，保持着一往直前、奋勇前进的力量。何文义说：“党和人民把我培养起来，给了我这么大的荣誉，而科学是一片汪洋大海，我没念过几天书，不努力可不行啊！”这几句朴素、真挚的语言，像钢铁相击迸发出来的火花，但愿这种火花点燃成千上万农村知识青年的心，发扬雄心壮志、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，把美丽的青春献给祖国，在祖国农村人民公社的建设史上，写出一页轰轰烈烈的灿烂的篇章。让世上还在被压迫的各兄弟民族见了扬眉吐气，得到鼓舞；让一切帝国主义者及其应声虫们见了目瞪口呆，不寒而栗！
    唱出时代的最强音，像《国际歌》那样谱出足以摄取人心、百唱不衰的最强的音符，应该说，仍然是我们通讯、特写的奋斗目标。近来在报刊上出现的一批通讯、特写，除去上面谈到的和没有谈到的一批优秀作品之外，还有一部分为数不少的通讯、特写，虽然也引人注目，或激动人心地反映出了我们现实斗争生活中的新人新事，但还没有“弹出”时代的最强音。只要我们的作家、记者站得高，望得远，肯于一头扎进现实斗争生活中，肯于刻苦学习并运用毛泽东思想观察、研究、分析现实生活，敢于以革命者的胆识为新生事物鸣锣开道，就有可能写出更多更好的通讯、特写，就有可能弹出最新最美的时代的音符，从中必定能够产生一曲又一曲激动人心的共产主义风格的凯歌。我满怀信心地期待着。
