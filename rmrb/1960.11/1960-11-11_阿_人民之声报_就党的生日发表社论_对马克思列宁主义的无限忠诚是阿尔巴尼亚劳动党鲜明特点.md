Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 8th. The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an editorial on November 8th commemorating the 19th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Labor Party.

The editorial stated that the establishment of the Albanian Communist Party (later renamed the Labor Party) was the greatest historical event for the Albanian people. The Albanian Communist Party was born in the flames of war and tempered in battle. After recounting the great achievements made by the Party in leading the people in the war of liberation and socialist construction, the editorial said: Our people attribute all this to their selfless labor, to socialism, to their loyal and glorious leader – the Albanian Labor Party, which is forever with the people and everything is for the people, and to the correct Marxist-Leninist line formulated by the Party's Leninist Central Committee headed by the Party's outstanding leader and the great son of our people, Comrade Hoxha. The editorial stated that the achievement of these great successes is also due to the enormous internationalist assistance given by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in Albania's socialist construction.

The editorial emphasized that the People's Republic of Albania is geographically the only country building socialism while surrounded by hostile countries – the lackeys of U.S. imperialism. Under the leadership of the Labor Party, the heroic Albanian people, with a pick in one hand and a gun in the other, have smashed all the conspiracies of the Belgrade revisionists, the Athens fascists, and all other external enemies headed by the U.S. imperialists, the most insane enemies of mankind. The editorial continued, today Albania's international prestige has greatly increased, and our People's Republic is making every effort to consolidate peace and international cooperation, to expose imperialism, and to promote friendship among the people of all countries. Our socialist Albania has become an important factor in safeguarding peace in the Balkans and Europe.

The editorial stated that the Albanian Labor Party, embodying all the virtues of the people, is constantly growing and strengthening. When the Party was founded in 1941, it had only two hundred members, but nineteen years later, it has developed into a powerful revolutionary party with more than 53,000 members and probationary members. The Party has established flesh-and-blood ties with the people through mass organizations. This iron-like unity between the Party and the people makes the enemy panic and enables any difficulties and obstacles to be overcome. On this basis, the people have created miracles, and our country is smoothly and rapidly building socialism. The editorial stated that the distinctive feature of the Albanian Labor Party has always been and still is its unlimited loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and the iron-like unity of the Party ranks around the Leninist Central Committee headed by Comrade Hoxha. In the current international situation, when the imperialist camp headed by U.S. imperialism is doing everything possible to spread bourgeois ideological toxins in various forms, when modern revisionism, represented by the Yugoslav revisionists, is doing its best to oppose the glorious science of Marxism-Leninism and to oppose the unity of the socialist camp and the entire international communist movement, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism has become an important task. Our Party believes that regarding modern revisionism as the main danger in the international communist movement, as pointed out in the historically significant Moscow Declaration, and exposing it politically and ideologically in an uncompromising and unwavering manner, is the primary task, which is conducive to consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to strengthening the international communist and workers' movement, and also to defending and consolidating world peace.

The editorial concluded by saying that the Albanian Labor Party, united as one with the people like steel, and illuminated by the glorious science of Marxism-Leninism, will gloriously complete all the great historical tasks facing it at home and abroad.

    阿“人民之声报”就党的生日发表社论
    对马克思列宁主义的无限忠诚是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党鲜明特点
    新华社地拉那8日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”8日发表社论，纪念阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立十九周年。
    社论说，阿尔巴尼亚共产党（后改名为劳动党）的建立对阿尔巴尼亚人民来说，是最伟大的历史事件。阿尔巴尼亚共产党是在战火中诞生的，并在战斗中得到了锻炼。社论在叙述了党领导人民进行解放战争和社会主义建设所取得的巨大成就后说：我国人民把这一切都归功于他们的忘我劳动，归功于社会主义，归功于他们的忠诚的和光荣的领导者——永远同人民在一起、一切都为了人民的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，归功于以党的卓越领袖、我国人民的伟大儿子霍查同志为首的列宁主义的中央委员会所制订的党的马克思列宁主义的正确路线。社论说，这些伟大成就的取得也由于苏联以及其它社会主义国家在阿尔巴尼亚的社会主义建设中所给予的巨大的国际主义援助。
    社论强调指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在地理上是唯一在敌对国家——美帝国主义的仆从们的包围下建设社会主义的国家。在劳动党领导下的英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民在这种特殊条件下，一手拿镐一手拿枪，粉碎了贝尔格莱德修正主义者、雅典法西斯分子和以人类最疯狂的敌人美帝国主义者为首的其他所有外部敌人的一切阴谋诡计。社论接着说，今天阿尔巴尼亚的国际威望有了很大的提高，我们人民共和国全力为巩固和平和国际合作、为揭露帝国主义和促进各国人民之间的友好进行斗争。我们社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚已经成为保障巴尔干地区和欧洲和平的一个重要的因素。
    社论说，体现着人民一切美德的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在不断成长和壮大。1941年党建立时只有二百个党员，而在十九年后的今天，它已经发展成了一个拥有五万三千多党员和预备党员的强大的革命政党。党通过群众性的组织建立了同人民的血肉联系。党和人民的这种钢铁般的团结使敌人惊慌失措，使任何困难和障碍都能得以克服。在这一基础上，人民创造了奇迹，我国正在顺利和快速地建设着社会主义。社论说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的鲜明特点过去和现在始终是对马克思列宁主义的无限忠诚和党的队伍在以霍查同志为首的列宁主义的中央委员会周围的钢铁般的团结。在目前的国际条件下，当以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营千方百计地以各种形式散布资产阶级思想毒素的时候，当以南斯拉夫修正主义者为代表的现代修正主义竭尽全力地反对光荣的马克思列宁主义科学，反对社会主义阵营和整个国际共产主义运动的团结的时候，保卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性就成了一项重要的任务。我们党认为，具有历史意义的莫斯科宣言中所指的把现代修正主义作为国际共产主义运动中的主要危险，在政治上和思想上对它进行毫不妥协、毫不动摇的揭露，是首要的任务，这是有利于巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、有利于加强国际共产主义和工人运动的，也是有利于保卫和巩固世界和平的。
    社论最后说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党同人民像钢铁一样地紧密团结在一起，在光荣的马克思列宁主义科学的照耀下，将光荣地完成它所面临着的一切国内和国际的巨大历史任务。
