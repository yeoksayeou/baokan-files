Nanning, November 4th (this newspaper) – Guangxi is widely promoting the advanced experiences of the Nandan Potato Seed Farm in seedling and stem cutting cultivation to greatly increase the planting of early-maturing, high-yielding potatoes suitable for three harvests a year. By the end of October, according to incomplete statistics from five special districts including Guilin and Liuzhou, over 15,000 mu have already been planted.

In the past, Guangxi did not have the custom of growing potatoes, which led to the saying that potatoes could not be grown in Guangxi. Based on multi-point planting and trial cultivation results in various places, and preliminary investigations by the autonomous region's agricultural departments in nine counties, including Rongxian, Guiping, Tengxian, Bobai, and Jingxi, more than 20 excellent potato varieties were discovered. The average yield per mu was consistently between 1,000 and 1,500 jin, with some reaching over 2,000 jin. These facts prove that Guangxi can not only grow potatoes, but can also cultivate them on a large and specialized scale. During this year's winter planting, various localities planned to vigorously promote potato cultivation, but encountered difficulties due to a shortage of seed potatoes. The advanced experiences of the Nandan Potato Seed Farm in creating seedling and stem cutting methods provided extremely favorable conditions for solving the seed shortage problem and vigorously developing potato production. In mid-October, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an on-site meeting in Nandan for rural affairs directors of local party committees and county committees to specifically summarize and promote the experiences of the Nandan Seed Farm. Currently, all localities are vigorously promoting the advanced experiences of the Nandan Potato Seed Farm's seedling and stem cutting methods, and are expanding their planting plans. Due to a shortage of seed potatoes, Liuzhou Special District originally planned to plant 40,000 mu. After the promotion of seedling and stem cutting methods, the planting plan was expanded to 114,000 mu. As of October 30th, the first batch of over 3,600 mu had been planted, most of which were planted using seedling and stem cutting methods.

Large-scale potato cultivation is a new path Guangxi has found in developing grain production. Potatoes are a crop with high yield, short maturity period, rich nutrition, and can be used as both food and vegetables. Given Guangxi's natural conditions, potatoes can be grown throughout the region. Depending on the growth period, they can be planted three to four times a year. If rotated with crops such as rice, it is also suitable for three harvests a year. In the double-cropping rice areas of central and southern Guangxi, in addition to planting two crops of rice, planting another crop of potatoes is easy and does not cause timing issues. Even in the high and cold mountainous areas of northern Guangxi, which are basically single-cropping, after the spring frost period, a crop of potatoes can be planted first, followed by a crop of medium rice or medium corn in early summer, and another crop of potatoes can be planted after the autumn harvest, also achieving three harvests a year. Furthermore, potatoes can be intercropped and relay cropped with many crops such as corn, sorghum, peanuts, millet, beans, and vegetables, several times a year. According to the experience of intercropping and relay cropping in various places, in addition to harvesting other coarse grains, each potato crop can yield 700 to 800 jin. Therefore, large-scale potato cultivation is indeed a new way for Guangxi to increase grain production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. (Attached picture)

### 广西大办粮食多种马铃薯  普遍推广苗栽和枝条栽法，缺种困难迎刃而解

    广西大办粮食多种马铃薯
    普遍推广苗栽和枝条栽法，缺种困难迎刃而解
    本报南宁4日电　广西各地普遍推广南丹马铃薯原种繁殖场所创造的苗栽法和枝条栽法的先进经验，大种早熟、高产宜于一年三熟的马铃薯。到10月底，据桂林、柳州等五个专区的不完全统计，已种下一万五千多亩。
    广西各地过去没有种植马铃薯的习惯，因而便产生了广西不能种马铃薯的说法。根据各地多点种植和试种的结果，和自治区农业部门在容县、桂平、藤县、博白、靖西等九个县初步的调查，发现了二十多个优良的马铃薯品种，平均亩产都稳定在一千至一千五百斤，高的达两千斤以上。这些事实证明广西不但能种马铃薯，而且可以大种特种。今年冬种当中，各地都计划大力推广种植马铃薯，但是遇到了薯种缺乏的困难。南丹马铃薯原种繁殖场所创造的苗栽法和枝条栽法的先进经验对解决缺乏薯种困难，大力发展马铃薯生产提供了极为有利的条件。中共广西自治区委员会10月中旬在南丹召开了各地委、县委农村部长现场会议，专门总结与推广了南丹原种场的经验。目前各地都在大力推广南丹马铃薯原种繁殖场的苗栽法和枝条栽法的先进经验，纷纷扩大种植计划。柳州专区各县因薯种很少，原来计划种植四万亩，苗栽法和枝条栽法推广后种植计划便扩大到十一万四千亩。到10月30日止，第一批已种下三千六百多亩，其中大部分是用苗栽法和枝条栽法种植的。
    大种马铃薯，这是广西在发展粮食生产上找到的一条新的生产途径。马铃薯是一种产量高、成熟期短、营养丰富，既能当饭又能当菜的一种农作物。就广西的自然条件，全区各地都可以种植马铃薯。按其生长期，一年可种三至四次。如果与水稻等作物轮作，也宜于一年三熟。在桂中、桂南的双季稻产区，除种植两季水稻外，再种一季马铃薯，时间从容不挤；就是在桂北基本上一年一熟的高寒山区，春季霜期过后，先种上一造马铃薯，夏初再种一造中稻或中玉米，秋收后又可以种上一造马铃薯，也能实现一年三熟。并且马铃薯还可以和玉米、高粱、花生、小米、豆类、蔬菜等许多作物间种、套种，一年也可间种几次，根据各地间种套种的经验，除收获其他杂粮外，仅马铃薯每造也可收获七、八百斤。所以大种马铃薯确是广西多快好省的增产粮食的一个新途径。（附图片）
