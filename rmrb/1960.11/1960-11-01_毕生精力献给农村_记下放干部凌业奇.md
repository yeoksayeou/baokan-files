    Devoting His Life to the Countryside
    ——Remembering the Downward-Bound Cadre Ling Yeqi
    Cui Yong'en
    One day in early August, commune members of the Dacheng Brigade of the Nanshan People's Commune in Huarong County, Hunan Province, were busily engaged in the rush to harvest, rush to plant, and fight drought. A middle-aged man wearing straw sandals and a straw hat ran to the fields to compete with the women in transplanting rice seedlings, and then jumped onto the waterwheel to compete with the young men in speed. He worked, asked questions, and talked, as the old farmer Wang Dongsheng ran to the side of the waterwheel frame and looked at him for a long time, stroking his beard and smiling: "You, this 'new peasant,' really work like a real one!" The young men immediately added: "He is not just a 'new peasant,' but also the deputy secretary of our commune's Party committee!"
    
    Spending a Lifetime in the Countryside
    This person called the deputy secretary and "new peasant" is named Ling Yeqi, and he is thirty-six years old this year. He was originally the deputy section chief of the storage and transportation section of the Hunan Provincial Department Store's Supply and Wholesale Station. In the autumn of 1957, the Party called on all cadres to go to the mountains and the countryside to build socialism. Ling Yeqi thought: "I was born in the countryside, worked as a cowherd, did odd jobs, and suffered hardships. Now the Party is leading the peasants to stand up and transform the 'poor and blank' countryside into something even better. I should dedicate my life to the countryside." So he submitted three applications to the Party organization in a row, requesting to settle down in the countryside. One day in October, Ling Yeqi's wish came true, and he and sixteen cadres from his organization came to the Huaying Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Jinggang Township, Huarong County, to help run the cooperative well.
    
    At that time, the Huaying Advanced Cooperative was not doing very well, and its production was always lagging behind the nearby cooperatives. In the cold winter months, the north wind was blowing hard, and some commune members were afraid of the cold and did not want to go to work, but there was not much fertilizer in the fields. "How can we increase production without fertilizer?" Ling Yeqi thought, and immediately picked up a shovel, invited a few commune members to take the lead and jumped into the frozen mud pond, digging with a hoe, one shovel at a time. The commune members were very moved when they saw this, and they picked up their shovels and baskets and followed them to work. With Ling Yeqi's help, Huaying Cooperative finally caught up with the advanced cooperatives.
    
    In February 1958, due to work needs, thirteen of the sixteen cadres who came with him were successively transferred back to the organization. The members of the Huaying Cooperative asked Ling Yeqi with concern: "Comrade Ling, many of the people who came with you have been transferred back, you won't leave, will you!" "Comrade Ling has helped us to get production going so vigorously, we would really hate to see you leave." Ling Yeqi also thought: I came with the intention of dedicating myself to the countryside, I can't just help a little and then leave. So he reported to his organization and the township Party committee, firmly requesting to be left in the countryside. The leadership, based on the situation at the time, agreed to his request. So in March of that year, he went to Changsha and brought his wife and children to the countryside, and settled down in Huaying Cooperative.
    
    At this time, He Shigu, who had come down with him, was a little uneasy about his work. After a meeting, he asked Ling Yeqi: "Are we really going to work in the countryside for the rest of our lives? To be honest, I can handle a short-term assignment, but if it's a long time...". He Shigu didn't say anything more. Ling Yeqi said to He Shigu seriously and kindly: "In the past, when we sat in the office, we didn't know where the fragrance of white rice came from. Now we want to build socialism and communism, can we do it if we don't build the countryside well and greatly develop agricultural production?" Ling Yeqi's words struck He Shigu's heart, and then he also submitted an application to the organization to stay in the countryside.
    
    "Jack-of-all-Trades"
    Ling Yeqi deeply understood that as a rural work cadre, he must not only have a red heart dedicated to the countryside, but also have rich production knowledge and leadership experience. Therefore, he made up his mind to learn from the peasants and from the grassroots cadres. Every time he went to work in a place, he would take old peasants as his teachers, and eat, live, work, and discuss with them to learn production knowledge.
    
    At the end of March 1958, the township Party committee transferred Ling Yeqi to work in the Jing'er Advanced Cooperative. When Ling Yeqi arrived at Jing'er Cooperative, he settled down in the home of poor peasant commune member Sun Laotou. A few days later, Sun Laotou went to Dongting Lake to repair water conservancy projects, and his old wife suddenly fell ill, and his son was too young. Ling Yeqi took on the cooking work for the family, getting up every day before dawn to fetch water and cook. Seeing that they were short of money, he took out twenty yuan for Sun Laotou's old wife to see a doctor. After Sun Laotou returned from the lake, he listened to his old wife's account of the situation, and saw that the production in the cooperative was in full swing, he was moved to tears, and he took the initiative to propose to Ling Yeqi: "Lao Ling, the Great Leap Forward has 'leapt' out my old strength, let's work together to do an experimental plot!" Ling Yeqi was very happy to hear this, and immediately took Sun Laotou as his teacher, working and learning with him every day. At that time, it was the season for transplanting rice seedlings, and when Ling Yeqi started transplanting rice seedlings, he often planted the seedlings in the footprints, and there were many floating roots. Sun Laotou told him to spread his feet wider, move his left leg when planting on the left, and move his right leg when planting on the right. This way, there were no floating roots. At the same time, Sun Laotou also taught him a whole set of knowledge to master the agricultural seasons.
    
    The five hundred mu of cotton planted by Jing'er Cooperative did not grow very well. The commune members said that the cotton in this cooperative had not grown well in the previous year either, and the yield was very low. "What is the reason for this?" Ling Yeqi pondered day and night. At this time, a cotton planting technician named Da Chuxiong came to the cooperative. Ling Yeqi immediately took Da Chuxiong as his teacher, learned cotton planting techniques from him, and finally mastered a new set of cotton planting techniques from sowing and thinning to pruning and pest control, and promoted them throughout the cooperative. This year, due to the adoption of new technologies, the cotton in the whole cooperative grew very well, and the yield was greatly increased compared with the previous year.
    
    After the communization, Ling Yeqi successively served as the general branch secretary in the Zhongnan, Dacheng and other brigades, and he also took old peasants such as Luo Sanyuan and Yan Qingde as his teachers, and humbly asked them for advice whenever he encountered problems in production. Now, except for ploughing the fields which is not very smooth, Ling Yeqi is already a "jack-of-all-trades" in farming.
    
      Excellent Production Leader
    Through several years of hard study and practical work, Ling Yeqi is not only familiar with agricultural production, but has also become an excellent production leader. When he served as the general branch secretary in the Nanshan, Zhongnan and other brigades, the production work was very outstanding. In the winter of 1959, he also attended the county's agricultural hero meeting. After the provincial Party committee put forward the call to "go deep into the front line" this year, he has been even more diligent and down-to-earth, adhering to eating, living, working, and discussing with the commune members, and fighting in the most difficult and arduous places. Some time ago, the Heling and Yongdou production teams of the Dacheng Brigade experienced drought, and nearly two hundred mu of early rice fields had no water for transplanting late rice. Ling Yeqi and the commune members carried a water pump and installed it at Huanglongzui for three days, so that these fields were filled with water in time, and several dozen mu of lake fields were expanded.

    毕生精力献给农村
    ——记下放干部凌业奇
    崔永恩
    8月初的一天，湖南省华容县南山人民公社大乘大队的社员，正在紧张地进行着抢收抢种和抗旱。一个脚穿草鞋、头戴草帽的中年汉子，一会跑到田里和妇女们插秧比武，一会又跳上水车和小伙子比快。他边干、边问、边谈，老农王冬生跑到车架旁向他瞧了半天，摸着胡子笑道：“你这个‘新农民’硬干得像个样子了呀！”小伙子们听了马上补充说道：他不止是“新农民”，而且是我们公社的党委副书记哩。
    在农村干一辈子
    这个被称为副书记、“新农民”的人，名叫凌业奇，今年三十六岁。他原是湖南省百货公司供应批发站储运科的副科长。1957年秋天，党向全体干部提出了上山下乡、建设社会主义的号召，凌业奇就想：“我出身农村，当过看牛娃，做过零工，受过苦。现在党领导农民翻了身，要把‘一穷二白’的农村建设得更加美好，我应该把毕生精力献给农村。”于是他一连向党组织递了三次申请书，要求到农村去落户。10月的一天，凌业奇的愿望实现了，他和本机关的十六个干部，一同来到了华容县景港乡华英高级农业社，负责帮助办好这个社。
    当时，华英高级社办得还不大好，生产老是赶不上附近的几个社。寒冬腊月，北风劲吹，有些社员怕冷不想出工，田里的肥料却不多。“没有肥料怎么能增产？”凌业奇想到这里，立即背起铁锹，邀了几个社员带头跳进结了冰的泥塘里，你一锄，我一锹地干起来。社员们看了，很受感动，纷纷拿起铁锹、畚箕，跟着出工了。在凌业奇的帮助下，华英社生产终于赶上了先进社。
    1958年2月，因为工作需要，同来的十六个干部，有十三个陆续调回机关去了。华英社的社员们关切地向凌业奇问道：“凌同志，你们同来的人好多又调回去了，你不会走吧！”“凌同志帮助我们把生产搞得这样带劲，要是去了，我们真舍不得。”凌业奇也想：我是抱着献身农村的志愿来的，可不能帮帮忙就走啊。他于是向本机关和乡党委打了报告，坚决要求把自己留在农村。领导上根据当时的情况，答应了他的要求。于是这年3月他到长沙把爱人和孩子一起接到乡下，在华英社安了家。
    就在这个时候，和他一起下去的何士谷却有点不安心工作。在一次会后，他问凌业奇：“我们真的在农村干一辈子吗？说实话，短期的我还搞得下去，要是时间长了……。”说到这里，何士谷不作声了。凌业奇严肃而又亲切地对何士谷说：“过去，我们坐在办公室，就是不晓得白米饭的香味是那来的。现在我们要建设社会主义和共产主义，不把农村建设好，不大大发展农业生产，能行吗？”凌业奇的话，句句打中了何士谷的心，接着，他也向组织上提出了留在农村的申请。
    “全　把　式”
    凌业奇深深懂得，做为一个农村工作干部，不仅要有一颗献身农村的红心，而且要有丰富的生产知识和领导经验。因此，他下定决心向农民学习，向基层干部学习，每到一个地方工作，就拜老农为师，和他们同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，学习生产知识。
    1958年3月底，乡党委调凌业奇到景二高级社工作。凌业奇到了景二社，就在贫农社员孙老头家里落了户。不几天，孙老头去洞庭湖修水利工程了，他的老伴突然害了病，儿子又太小。凌业奇便担起了这一家的炊事工作，每天麻麻亮就起身挑水，做饭。看到他家缺钱，又拿出二十元为孙老头的老伴看病。孙老头治湖回来后，听了老伴告诉他的情况，又看到社里的生产搞得热火朝天，感动得流下泪来，他主动地向凌业奇提出：“老凌，大跃进把我的老劲也‘跃’出来了，我们合伙搞丘田试验吧。”凌业奇听了非常高兴，立即拜孙老头为师，天天跟他一起劳动，边学边做。那时正是插秧季节，凌业奇开始插秧时，常常把秧插在脚迹凼里，浮蔸很多。孙老头就告诉他两脚要跨宽些，插左边移左腿，插右边移右腿。这样果然不浮蔸了。同时，孙老头还传授给他一整套掌握农事季节的知识。
    景二社种的五百亩棉花，长得不大好。听社员说，先一年这个社的棉花也长得不好，产量很低。“这是什么原因呢？”凌业奇日夜考虑着。这时社里来了一个植棉技术员，名叫达楚雄。凌业奇就马上拜达楚雄为师，向他学习植棉技术，终于掌握了从播种、间苗到整枝治虫等一套植棉的新技术，并在全社作了推广。这一年由于采用了新技术，全社棉花长得很好，产量比上一年大大提高。
    公社化以后，凌业奇先后在中南、大乘等大队担任总支书记，他又拜了罗三元、言清德等老农为师，一遇到生产上的问题，就虚心向他们请教。现在，凌业奇除犁田还不大顺手外，已是一个种田的“全把式”了。
      优秀的生产领导者
    经过几年来刻苦学习和实际工作的锻炼，凌业奇不但熟悉农业生产，而且成为一个优秀的生产领导者。他在南山、中南等大队担任总支书记时，生产工作都很出色。1959年冬他还出席了县农业群英会。今年省委提出“深入第一线”的号召后，他更是勤恳踏实，坚持与社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，战斗在最艰苦、最困难的地方。前些时候，大乘大队鹤龄、永斗两个生产队发生旱象，近二百亩早稻田没有水插晚稻，凌业奇和社员抬着抽水机在黄龙嘴安装了三天，使这些田及时灌满了水，并扩种了几十亩湖田。
