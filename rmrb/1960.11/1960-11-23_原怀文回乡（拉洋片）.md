　　One
　　Hey, look at this energetic and vigorous person,
　　Simple and approachable like a farmer,
　　If you ask his name and surname,
　　He is the former Lieutenant Yuan Huaiwen.
　　Thirteen years of military service is not a short time,
　　He has courage and strategy surpassing others.
　　To strengthen the frontline of agricultural production,
　　In 1958, he transferred back to the countryside.
　　He lives in Yushe County, Shanxi Province,
　　He is very happy to return to his hometown for production.
　　The villagers all ask about his well-being:
　　Huaiwen, what exactly are you going to do back home?
　　Huaiwen said, "People always have to do something,
　　I am determined to engage in production with everyone."
　　Hearing his words, everyone is half-doubtful and half-believing:
　　Is it possible for an officer to wield a hoe?
　　The truth is the proof,
　　Hey, if it's true, everyone welcomes it!

　　Two
　　Hey, Yuan Huaiwen arrived at the production team,
　　The team members are all delighted,
　　Huaiwen speaks from the heart,
　　He is a good soldier who can go up and down.
　　Some commune members worry that he can't endure hardship,
　　And don't know if he can do farm work?
　　A commune member deliberately tries him:
　　Huaiwen, carry manure, the work is not easy!
　　"Okay!" Huaiwen readily agreed,
　　Walking briskly and busily.
　　While carrying manure, he tells stories of combat,
　　The team members' enthusiasm increases as they listen.
　　He did a day and a half's work in one day,
　　It's really lively and energetic.
　　In a few days, Huaiwen's shoulders became swollen,
　　He insisted on working hard without lagging behind.
　　The captain wanted to give him some lighter work,
　　He said, "No, no, this is a small matter,
　　In terms of hardship, it's far worse than the front line,
　　I can handle farm work after a while!"
　　The team members all praised:
　　Hey, he is a hero in killing the enemy,
　　A pacesetter in production!

　　Three
　　Hey, livestock are the "treasure of farmers,"
　　Yuan Huaiwen grew up in the countryside and knows this clearly.
　　He passes by the breeding farm every day,
　　But only sees the team's cattle herd thin and bony,
　　He thought that if this problem is not solved,
　　How can we plow the land and sow seeds?
　　He reported to the branch in a hurry,
　　Only after in-depth investigation did it become clear:
　　The breeder embezzled the cattle feed and didn't feed enough,
　　After the replacement, a successor could not be found for a while.
　　Some old men dislike this work as troublesome,
　　And they are not at ease letting young people do it,
　　Yuan Huaiwen volunteered to take on the job,
　　Hey, in two months, he fed the cattle herd plump and healthy!

　　Four
　　Hey, everyone is happy about the establishment of the commune,
　　Everyone is working hard to increase production.
　　Collective production must have collective life,
　　Running public canteens is a major matter.
　　There is debate about this matter,
　　Everyone is discussing it.
　　Some say that the autumn harvest and autumn planting are very busy,
　　It can also be done after the autumn.
　　Yuan Huaiwen argued to do it immediately:
　　Not running a canteen will affect production significantly.
　　After debate, the understanding was unified,
　　But there is a lack of someone who can write, calculate, and manage.
　　Yuan Huaiwen volunteered to be the administrator,
　　Calculating carefully with his brain.
　　He personally goes to the canteen to cook,
　　And makes improvements when problems are discovered.
　　The commune members' lives are well arranged,
　　Hey, and saved 2,200 catties of grain!

　　Five
　　Hey, Huaiwen is in charge of breeding and is also an administrator,
　　The work is heavy and he is a busy person,
　　He is not satisfied with even a little achievement,
　　He is even more energetic and spirited.
　　He said that this is just a side job and doesn't count for much,
　　Grasping production is the big thing.
　　To increase agricultural production,
　　Water conservancy construction is the guarantee.
　　He made a suggestion to open canals and intercept weirs.
　　The commune members all responded.
　　Who knew that just after the big canal was built,
　　A torrential rain kept falling,
　　The west weir was breached,
　　The flood was terrifying.
　　Yuan Huaiwen took the lead in jumping into the water,
　　Using his body to block the breach.
　　He overcame the flood and protected the canal,
　　Hey, and obtained a good harvest in the autumn!

　　Six
　　Hey, the good tradition of the People's Army is brought to the countryside,
　　Yuan Huaiwen is both martial and literate,
　　Not only is he good at the production front,
　　He is also a capable person in propaganda and education.
　　He carries newspapers and materials with him,
　　And publicizes them carefully and diligently whenever he has time.
　　He solves the ideological problems of the commune members,
　　He is very patient in conversations and interviews.
　　His team's production is particularly good,
　　He won first place in the commune-wide competition.
　　Huaiwen said, "This is all thanks to the leadership of the Party,
　　Without the Party, we can't move an inch!"
　　Yushe County has established a red flag,
　　Hey, this is the demobilized soldier Yuan Huaiwen!

    原怀文回乡
    （拉洋片）
    易和元
      一
    哎，看这人生龙活虎有干劲，
    朴实可亲像农民，
    若要问他名和姓，
    他原是中尉军官原怀文。
    参军十三年时间不算短，
    有胆有略胜过人。
    为了加强农业生产第一线，
    一九五八年转业他回到农村。
    他家住在山西榆社县，
    回乡生产他心中高兴万分。
    乡亲们都来问长和问短：
    怀文呀，你回家到底干啥事情？
    怀文说：“人总得有事干，
    和大伙搞生产我有决心。”
    听他言大家半疑又半信：
    是军官拿镢头可不可能？
    是真是假事实作凭证，
    哎，若是真的大家都欢迎！
        二
    哎，原怀文到了生产队，
    队员个个喜盈盈，
    怀文说的真心话，
    能上能下是个好军人。
    有的社员担心他吃不下苦，
    庄稼活儿不知行不行？
    有个社员存心把他试：
    怀文，担粪吧，活儿可不轻！
    “行！”怀文顺口就答应，
    脚步如飞忙不停。
    边挑粪边把战斗故事讲，
    社员们听着听着干劲增。
    一天时间干了一天半的活，
    真正是又热闹来又带劲。
    不几天怀文肩膀发了肿，
    他坚持干活不后人。
    队长要给他换点轻活干，
    他说：“不，不，这是小事情，
    论艰苦，比起前线还差得远，
    庄稼活打熬一段就能行！”
    队员们个个都称赞：
    哎，杀敌是英雄，
    生产是标兵！
        三
    哎，牲畜本是“农家宝”，
    原怀文农村长大认识清。
    他每天打从饲养场前过，
    但只见队里牛群瘦棱棱，
    他心想这个问题不解决，
    耕地下种怎能行？
    他向支部忙汇报，
    经过深入调查才弄清：
    饲养员贪污牛料不喂够，
    撤换后一时找不着接替人。
    有些老汉嫌这工作麻烦大，
    让年轻人干大伙又不放心，
    原怀文主动报名来担任，
    哎，两个月就把牛群喂得胖登登！
        四
    哎，公社成立人人都高兴，
    努力生产个个干劲增。
    集体生产必须集体生活，
    兴办公共食堂是件大事情。
    这件事情大家有争论，
    你一言他一语议论纷纷。
    有的说秋收秋种忙得很，
    秋后再办也能成。
    原怀文力争马上办：
    不办食堂影响生产可不轻。
    经过辩论统一了认识，
    但却缺能写会算经管人。
    原怀文自告奋勇担任事务长，
    精打细算用脑筋。
    亲下食堂做饭菜，
    发现问题就改进。
    社员生活安排得好，
    哎，还节约粮食二千二百斤！
        五
    哎，怀文搞饲养又当事务长，
    工作繁重是忙人，
    有成绩一丝一毫不满足，
    劲头更足有精神。
    他说这是捎搭活儿算不得啥，
    抓生产才是大事情。
    为了农业能增产，
    兴修水利那才有保证。
    开渠截堰他把建议提。
    社员们大家都响应。
    谁知大渠刚修好，
    倾盆大雨下个不停，
    西堰冲开一个口，
    洪水滔滔吓煞人。
    原怀文带头跳下水，
    以身堵口作斗争。
    战胜洪水保住渠堰，
    哎，秋天获得好收成！
        六
    哎，人民军队好传统带到农村，
    原怀文能武又能文，
    不单生产战线是好手，
    搞宣传教育也是能人。
    报纸材料随身带，
    一有空就宣传仔细认真。
    社员有思想问题他就解决，
    谈话访问很耐心。
    他的队生产特别好，
    全公社评比得了头名。
    怀文说：“这都要归功于党的领导，
    没有党我们是寸步难行！”
    榆社县树起了红旗一面，
    哎，这就是转业军人原怀文！
