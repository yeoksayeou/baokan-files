　　Xinhua News Agency, 31st: The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation today sent telegrams to the Youth and Sports Committee of the Algerian National Liberation Front and the General Association of Algerian Muslim Students on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian people's armed uprising on November 1st and International Day of Support for Algerian Fighting Students, expressing, on behalf of all Chinese youth and students, their heartfelt respect to the Algerian people, youth and students who are heroically engaged in the national liberation struggle.
    The telegram said: "For six years, the Algerian people and youth have persisted in carrying out a tenacious national liberation struggle, which is an important development in the contemporary colonial revolution movement. It has severely hit the armed suppression and aggression policies of the French colonialists supported by US imperialism. The facts in Algeria once again show that imperialism is unwilling to easily lay down its butcher knife. When imperialism imposes a war of aggression on itself, it is only possible to drive away the aggressors and achieve genuine peace and independence by resolutely and thoroughly inflicting a painful blow on the aggressors with a just war." The heroic and unyielding revolutionary spirit of the Algerian people, youth and students has set a brilliant example for the African people and won the deep sympathy and support of the people of the world. The Chinese people and youth have always regarded your victory as their own victory. Chinese youth and students will always stand with the Algerian people, youth and students, and will always resolutely support your national liberation struggle. We firmly believe that the seemingly powerful imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. Their temporary rampantness is nothing but a dying struggle. The truly powerful and invincible force is not the decadent imperialism, but the awakened and fighting Algerian people. Although there will be various difficulties on the road ahead for the Algerian national liberation struggle, as long as the Algerian people and youth continue to strengthen their unity and carry out unremitting struggle, they will surely be able to defeat all aggressors, completely and thoroughly liberate their homeland, and achieve the final victory of national liberation."

    全国青联、全国学联致电
    支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放斗争
    新华社31日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会，今天就11月1日阿尔及利亚人民武装起义六周年和国际支援阿尔及利亚战斗学生日，打电报给阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线青年及体育委员会以及阿尔及利亚穆斯林学生总会，代表全中国青年和学生向正在英勇地进行民族解放斗争的阿尔及利亚人民、青年和学生表示衷心的敬意。
    电报说：“六年来，阿尔及利亚人民和青年坚持进行顽强的民族解放斗争，是当代殖民地革命运动的一个重要发展，它沉重地打击了美帝国主义支持的法国殖民主义者的武装镇压政策和侵略政策。阿尔及利亚的事实，再一次说明，帝国主义是不肯轻易放下它的屠刀的，当帝国主义把侵略战争强加在自己头上的时候，也只有用正义战争坚决地、彻底地给予侵略者以痛击，才有可能把侵略者赶走，取得真正的和平和独立。“阿尔及利亚人民、青年和学生英勇不屈的革命精神，为非洲人民树立了光辉的榜样，赢得了全世界人民的深切同情和支持。中国人民和青年从来就把你们的胜利看成是自己的胜利，中国青年和学生永远同阿尔及利亚人民、青年和学生站在一起，永远坚决支持你们的民族解放斗争。我们坚信，貌似强大的帝国主义只不过是一只纸老虎，他们一时的猖獗不过是垂死的挣扎，真正有力量的、不可战胜的不是腐朽的帝国主义，而是觉醒起来的、战斗的阿尔及利亚人民。尽管在阿尔及利亚民族解放斗争的前进道路上还会有种种困难，但是，阿尔及利亚人民和青年只要不断加强自己的团结，进行坚持不懈的斗争，就一定能够战胜一切侵略者，全部彻底地解放自己的国土，取得民族解放的最后胜利。”
