    Grain Loving Model - Granny Le

    Le Jinhua, a 67-year-old member of the Xicun Commune in Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, picked up 702 jin of grain from the harvested fields during this year's summer and autumn harvests. As a result, she was评为全社爱粮模范 (péngwéi quán shè ài liáng mófàn) - rated the communal grain-loving model by the masses.

    Granny Le came from a poor peasant background and lived a life of semi-starvation before liberation. After liberation, especially after the communization, Granny Le's life got better and better. Thinking about the past and looking at the present filled her with deep feelings for the Party and the commune. She is already very old, and the team did not assign her any work, but she does whatever she can do when she sees it, and she can't be idle for a moment.

    She especially cherishes grain. Seeing that the team's temporary grain storage place had no door, she voluntarily took the door from her own house and installed it to prevent the grain from being damaged. Usually, whenever she sees someone wasting grain, she always kindly offers her opinion. She often says: It's a pity to waste the grain that is so hard to produce. Some people say she "pokes her nose into other people's business," but she says: "I just like to mind these 'idle affairs'." This year, during the summer harvest, the commune called on everyone to harvest and thresh carefully, so that every grain would be stored. Granny Le prepared a load of baskets, two sieves, a dustpan, and a broom. After the summer harvest began, she took her tools and went around the roads and threshing floors every day, picking up any ears of rice she saw, and sweeping up any grains she saw. Sometimes she didn't even bother to rest at noon.

    One day, she was returning from the hospital with her little granddaughter after seeing a doctor, and passed by a threshing floor of the Xiao Family team. The rice had been threshed there, but she found that there were still many grains of rice in the grass, some of which had already sprouted. She hurried home, entrusted her granddaughter to Liu Jin'e, the cook in the canteen, and went to sweep up the grain. Jin'e advised her, "The child is still sick, just pick up a little grain, it's not our team's anyway." Granny Le said, "If I see grain being wasted and don't care, wouldn't that be even more criticized? I don't care which team it is, it's a pity to waste it." This time, she picked up fourteen or fifteen jin of grain.

    The team had decided to give her some cash at a reduced price for the grain she picked up. Granny Le resolutely refused the money. She said, "The grain was not produced by me, it is originally the fruit of everyone's labor. I just spent a little effort, this is what I should do!" (Jiang Fen) (Attached picture)

    爱粮模范——乐老婆婆
    江西宜春县西村公社社员、六十七岁的乐金华老婆婆，在今年夏收和秋收期间，从已收割的庄稼地里，拣回了七百零二斤粮食，因此被群众评为全社爱粮模范。
    乐老婆婆出身贫农，解放前，过着半饥半饱的日子。解放后，特别是公社化后，乐老婆婆家的日子越过越好。想想过去，看看现在，使她对党对公社产生了深厚的感情。她年纪已经很大了，队里没有给她分派工作，可是她看到什么能做的就做什么，一时也闲不住。
    她特别珍惜粮食，看到队里临时放粮食的地方没有门，为了不使粮食受损失，她就主动地把自己家的房门拆下来安上去。平时，只要看到谁糟蹋粮食，她总要好意地提出意见。她经常说：好容易生产出来的粮食，浪费掉太可惜了。有人说她“爱管闲事”，她就说：“我就喜欢管这些‘闲事’。”今年夏收时，社里号召大家细收细打，做到颗粒归仓。乐老婆婆就准备了一担箩、两把筛子、一个簸箕和一把扫帚。夏收开始后，她带着那套工具，每天到路上、打禾场上去转，看到有禾穗就拾，有谷粒就扫。有时连中午也顾不得休息。
    有一天，她带着小孙女从医院看病回来，路过肖家小队的一个打禾场。那里禾是打完了，但她发现草地里还有不少谷粒，有的已经发了芽。她赶紧回家，把孙女托付给食堂炊事员刘金娥，就去扫谷。金娥劝她说：“小孩还病着，点把谷就算了，反正又不是我们队的。”乐老婆婆说：“要是看到粮食浪费不管，那不更该受批评？管它是那个队的，浪费了就可惜。”这一次，她就拣回来十四、五斤谷子。
    对拣回的粮食，队里曾决定折价给一部分现款。乐老婆婆坚决不要这些钱。她说：“谷子又不是我生产出来的，本来就是大家的劳动果实，我只不过花了一点工夫，这是应该做的事情啊！”　（江分）（附图片）
