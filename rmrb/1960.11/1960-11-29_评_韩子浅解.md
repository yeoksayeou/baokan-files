	Review of "A Simple Explanation of Han Fei"
		By Liang Qixiong, published by Zhonghua Book Company		By Guan Feng

	Recently, Zhonghua Book Company published "A Simple Explanation of Han Fei" by Mr. Liang Qixiong. This book is one of the achievements in sorting out ancient books in recent years, and it is also one of the better ones in the existing collections and commentaries on "Han Feizi." In terms of textual research and collation, this book concentrates on the annotations of more than 20 scholars from China and Japan, adopting their essence and eliminating the complex. The author's attitude is relatively cautious, the selection is relatively appropriate, and there are no tedious or trivial problems. This book also concentrates on the achievements of various schools of thought on the textual research of "Han Feizi" over the past few decades, and introduces the conclusions of various schools of thought in simple and easy-to-understand language. In terms of textual research, collation, and textual criticism, the author puts forward some new insights, and some of these insights are very insightful. For example, regarding the "Difficulty in Power" chapter: Some people believe that this chapter is the author's rebuttal of Shen Dao's "rule by power" proposition, and regard the phrase "Responding to Shen Dao says" as the author's proposition of this chapter. Some have asserted based on this that this chapter was not written by Han Fei, but is a pseudo-work that has been mixed in; others have asserted based on this that Han Fei also advocated "appointing the worthy," and refuted the phrase "Responding to Shen Dao says" as not being written by Han Fei, but rather mixed into the text by later generations who criticized Han Fei. The former statement is obviously incorrect; while the latter statement also leads to self-contradiction, because people cannot deny that Han Fei advocated "rule by power." Since Han Fei advocated "rule by power," even if he also advocated "appointing the worthy," how could he refute Shen Dao's "rule by power" proposition? Mr. Liang Qixiong's solution to this problem is reasonable, he said: "The title of this chapter, 'Difficulty in Power,' is Han Fei's assumption that a guest is questioning Shen Dao's theory of rule by power, and Han Fei is refuting the guest's 'questioning.' It is not a question of Han Fei refuting Shen Dao's theory of rule by power." He believes that "Responding to Shen Dao says" are the words of the "guest," and from "Responding again says" to the end of the chapter, "it is all Han Fei standing on Shen Dao's side and 'refuting' the guest who 'responds to Shen Dao.' From this 'refutation,' he expresses how he defends Shen Dao on the one hand, and expresses his own views on the other hand." Mr. Liang also made a more careful collation and sorting of the large passage from "Responding again says" onwards. After such collation and sorting, the basic commonalities and differences between Han Fei and Shen Dao become easier to see clearly.

	Therefore, this book is not only of great reference value for Chinese intellectual historians studying Han Fei's thought, but also convenient for general readers to browse. In addition to concise annotations, this book also has two more prominent advantages:

	I. Most have concise introductions to the chapters, either about the textual research of this chapter, or about the brief explanation of the central idea and basic concepts of this chapter, or a combination of both. If there is any shortcoming here, it is: there are still some chapters without introductions; some chapters' introductions are only about the conclusions of textual research, and there is no explanation of the central idea or basic concepts.

	II. Regarding the annotation aspect, after a short paragraph, most have explanations of the basic ideas of the original work. These explanations are not only mostly accurate and concise, but also popular and easy to understand, almost like a modern translation. However, compared with modern translation, this approach has a significant advantage: some ancient words are very difficult to translate into modern Chinese, and translators, in order to take care of the tone of the original work and to convey the spirit, often have to translate word by word, and even idiomatic translations have to pay close attention to simulating the style of the original work, but this often cannot completely and accurately express the original meaning of the original author (although the translator does accurately grasp the original author's thought), or even completely deviates from the original meaning; Mr. Liang Qixiong's approach is much more flexible, he summarizes the original work's thought in his own words, which gives him more freedom in writing than modern translation. From a literary point of view, this cannot replace modern translation; but from the perspective of studying intellectual history, or from the perspective of helping general readers learn historical knowledge, this is better than modern translation. - From this, I thought of such an opinion: some very difficult-to-translate classical philosophical documents (or the very difficult-to-translate parts of them) can be replaced by summarizing the original meaning instead of modern translation. If the author has conducted a serious study of the original work and grasped its thought, then it can more accurately convey the original meaning than modern translation. Of course, if there is no serious study of the original work, then whether it is translated or summarized in one's own words, it can only distort the original work, and even the latter is more likely to cause distortion.

	In this advantage, Mr. Liang's book also has a shortcoming, that is: some sentences and paragraphs do not have popular explanations. Of course, there are some original texts that are still popular and clear today, and do not need to be explained again, but there are also many that are not easy to understand and need to be explained. If all the original texts that are easy to understand today are removed, and popular explanations are made for the rest, it would be more convenient for general readers.

	It seems that Mr. Liang's textual research focuses on the use of induction, that is, from the "Han Feizi" book (and sometimes also referring to other books) to comprehensively summarize the same nouns, terms, and concepts, so as to propose explanations. This method is usable. In this way, the explanations put forward are often more accurate and consistent with the original meaning. For example, Mr. Liang's explanation of "promoting power": "The word 'power' seems to contain two meanings: (1) power and authority, expressed in the sentences 'power does not want to be seen,' 'the sage holds the key,' and 'the sage holds one.' (2) weighing and measuring, expressed in the sentences 'things have their suitability, talents have their application,' 'therefore appoint them,' and 'the superior controls the measure to divide his subordinates.' The direct translation of 'promoting power' is 'raising the power and authority high,' and its idiomatic translation is 'advocating and praising the power of the monarch.'" This explanation is more appropriate. Mr. Liang also made a relatively accurate explanation of Han Fei's important concept of "verification" using induction. However, this method also has limitations. Sometimes doing so is not enough, and it is also necessary to conduct research from the opposite side of this school of thought, from their opposition, and it is necessary to conduct Marxist-Leninist analysis, dissection, and criticism of the entire ideological system of this school of thought, and then the basic concepts, basic categories, and the internal logical connections between these concepts and categories can be clearly understood. For example, regarding Han Fei's basic concept of "power," Mr. Liang summarized "power and authority," "weight of power," and "awe-inspiring power" from the "Han Feizi" book, and said: "'Power' has the meaning of 'authority'"; and based on the passage in the "Eight Classics" chapter "All governance of the world must be based on human nature, and human nature has likes and dislikes, so rewards and punishments can be used… …," he said: "'Authority' is created by relying on the psychology of human likes and dislikes or the situation of popular sentiment, and the monarch uses this 'psychology' and 'situation' to deal with politics, and it becomes a political power of rule by power." This explanation cannot be said to be wrong, but it is still very insufficient. For the concept of "power," it is necessary to link it with the concept of "rule of law" and clarify it from their unity of opposites. I believe that Han Fei's "power" has the meaning of objective inevitability. He also believes that in addition to "natural power," there is also "human-made power." "Human-made power" touches on the relationship between objective inevitability and subjective initiative in the social field. Of course, Han Fei was unable to scientifically solve this problem. "Human-made power" contains the contradiction between the subjective and the objective. Han Fei was unable to solve it. As a result, starting from the recognition of objective inevitability, he moved to historical idealism of "law" determining everything in the historical field. This view may not be accurate. But I believe that to accurately, comprehensively, and deeply explain Han Fei's concept of "power," it is necessary to link it with his concept of "rule of law" and conduct a Marxist analysis and criticism of Han Fei's entire ideological system. It is not enough to use induction alone - there is no doubt about this.

	The preliminary sorting of ancient books is the foundation for conducting Marxist-Leninist analysis and criticism. Some things that are still not clear can be left in doubt, and the questions can be raised to the readers to be clarified in the future, which is also very beneficial. Every achievement in the sorting of ancient books should be valued and encouraged. On the other hand, the in-depth study of ancient books, such as the solution of certain difficult problems, cannot be separated from Marxist analysis and criticism. That is to say, the preliminary sorting of ancient books provides conditions for conducting Marxist analysis and criticism; and this analysis and criticism will in turn help the in-depth study of ancient books. It seems that the further in-depth study of textual research, collation, and textual criticism of ancient books will inevitably require more guidance from the dialectical materialist methodology. Therefore, I think that researchers of Chinese philosophy history and those who engage in textual research, collation, and textual criticism of ancient books should cooperate closely and help each other. Researchers of Chinese philosophical thought history should care about the work of sorting out ancient books. On the one hand, they should humbly seek help from those who engage in textual research, collation, and textual criticism, and on the other hand, they should actively care for and help them, and they should also try their best to do some in-depth and meticulous work in textual research, collation, and textual criticism.

    评“韩子浅解”
    梁启雄著　中华书局出版	关锋
    最近中华书局出版了梁启雄先生著的《韩子浅解》。这本书是近几年来整理古籍的成绩之一，也是现有《韩非子》集解一类书中较好的一本。这本书在训诂、校勘方面，集中了中、日二十余家的校释，采择了他们的精华，汰除了繁杂。作者态度比较谨严，取舍比较适当，没有繁琐和陷于枝节的毛病。这本书还集中了几十年来各家对于《韩非子》考证的成绩，以浅近易懂的语言介绍了各家考证的结论。在训诂、校勘和考证三方面，作者都提出一些新的见解，有些见解是很精辟的。例如，关于《难势》篇：有些人认为，这一篇是作者反驳慎子的“势治”主张的，把“应慎子曰”一段话当作此篇作者的主张。有的据此断言这一篇不是韩非所作，乃是混入的伪品；有的据此断言韩非亦主张“任贤”，而驳斥“应慎子曰”的“复应之曰”一段话，不出韩非之手，而是后人难韩非之辞混入正文。前一说，显然是不对的；而后一说也弄到自相矛盾的地步，因为人们是不能否认韩非主张“势治”的。既然韩非主张
  “势治”，即使他也主张“任贤”，怎么会反驳慎子的“势治”主张呢？梁启雄先生对这个问题的解决是合情合理的，他说：“本篇标题‘难势’，是韩子假设客人诘难慎到的势治学说，而韩子对客人的‘诘难’加以反驳的题目，不是韩子驳难慎到势治学说的文题。”他认为“应慎子曰”是“客人”的话，自“复应之曰”直到篇末“全是韩子站在慎到一边对‘应慎子’的客作‘反驳’，从这个‘反驳’中，一面表达出他怎样替慎子辩护，一面表达出他自己的见解。”对自“复应之曰”以下一大段文字，梁先生也作了较精审的校勘、疏理。经过这样一番校勘、疏理，韩非和慎子的基本共同点以及他们的不同点，就比较容易看清楚了。
    因此，这本书不仅对于中国思想史工作者研究韩非的思想说来，很有参考价值，而且也便于一般读者浏览。除了注释简明以外，这本书还有两个比较突出的优点：
    一、大都有简明的解题，或者是关于这一篇的考证，或者是关于这一篇的中心思想、基本概念的简要说明，或者是两者兼而有之。如果说，这里有什么缺点的话，就是：还有若干篇没有解题；有些篇的解题，只是关于考证的结论，而没有关于中心思想或基本概念的说明。
    二、关于注释方面，一小段之后，大半有对原作基本思想的解说，这些解说不但大都比较准确、扼要，而且通俗浅显，同今译差不多。但是同今译比较起来，这个做法有一个显著的优点：有些古语译成今文是很困难的，译者为了照顾原作的语气，为了传神，常常不得不一字一句地对译过来，就是意译也得十分注意模拟原作的风格，这样却常常不能完全准确地表达原著者的原意（尽管译者确是准确地把握了原著的思想），甚或完全走了样；梁启雄先生的做法却灵活得多，他把原著的思想，用自己的话撮述出来，这在行文上就比今译有了更大的自由。从文学角度来看，这是不能代替今译的；但从研究思想史的角度来看，或从帮助一般读者学习历史知识来看，这比今译要好些。——由此，我想到这样一个意见：有些十分难译的古典哲学文献（或其中十分难译的部分），可以用撮述原意的办法代替今译。如果作者对原著进行了认真的研究，把握了它的思想，那就可以比今译更能够准确地传达原意。当然，如果对原著没有认真的研究，那末，译也好，用自己的话撮述大意也好，都只能是歪曲原著，甚至后者更容易造成歪曲。
    在这一优点方面，梁先生的书也有一个缺点，就是：有些句段没有通俗的解说。固然有一些原文是今天看来还通俗明白，不烦再为解说，但是也有很多并不好解，是需要作解说的。如果除去今天看来原文是通俗易懂的以外，都做出通俗解说，那就更便于一般读者了。
    看来，梁先生的训诂，着重使用的是归纳法，即从《韩非子》书中（有时也参考其他的书）把同一的名词、术语、概念加以综合归纳，从而提出解释。这个方法是可用的。这样，提出来的解释常常比较准确，符合原意。例如，梁先生对于“扬权”的解释：“‘权’字似含二义：（一）权柄，表现在‘权不欲见’‘圣人执要’，‘圣人执一’等句上。（二）权衡，表现在‘物者有所宜，材者有所施’，‘因而任之’，‘上操度量以割其下’等句上。《扬权》的直译，是‘高举权柄’，它的意译，是‘崇尚和称扬君权。’”这种解释是比较妥当的。对于韩非的“参验”这一重要概念，梁先生也是用归纳法作出了比较确切的解释。但是，这个方法也是有局限性的。有时候这样做就不够，还需要从这一学派的对立面、从他们的对立中来进行研究，需要对这一学派的整个思想体系进行马克思列宁主义的分析、解剖、批判，然后，其基本概念、基本范畴和这些概念、范畴之间的内在逻辑联系，才能搞得十分清楚。例如，关于韩非的“势”这一基本概念，梁先生从韩非书中归纳了“权势”、“势重”、“威势”，而说：“‘势’字有‘权威’之意”；并根据《八经》篇的“凡治天下，必因人情，人情有好恶，故赏罚可用…　…”一段话，而说：“‘权威’是因依着人情好恶的心理或人心向背的形势而造成的，君主就利用这‘心理’和‘形势’来处理政治，就成为势治政权。”这种解释，不能说不对，但是还很不够。对于“势”这个概念，需要同“法治”概念联系起来，从它们的对立统一中来加以阐明。我认为，韩非的“势”，有客观必然性的意思。他又认为除“自然之势”外，还有“人设之势”。“人设之势”，就接触到了社会领域内客观必然性和主观能动性的关系问题，当然，韩非没有能够科学地解决这个问题。“人设之势”，包含了主客观的矛盾，韩非没有能够解决它，结果从承认客观必然性出发，在历史领域走到了“法”决定一切的历史唯心主义。这一看法，也未必准确。但是我认为，要确切、全面、深刻地阐明韩非的“势”这一概念，必须同他的“法治”概念联系起来，对韩非的整个思想体系进行马克思主义的分析批判，单用归纳法是不够的，——这却是没有疑问的。
    对古籍的初步整理，是进行马克思列宁主义的分析批判的基础。有些还弄不清楚的，可以存疑，把问题提给读者，以待将来再弄清楚，这也是很有益的。古籍整理方面的每一项成绩，都应该受到重视和鼓励。另一方面，古籍整理工作的深入，例如某些难题的解决，却也离不开马克思主义的分析批判。就是说，古籍的初步整理对于进行马克思主义的分析批判，提供了条件；而这一分析批判工作，又会反转来帮助古籍整理工作的深入。看来，古籍的训诂、校勘以及考证工作的进一步深入，势必更多地要求辩证唯物主义的方法论的指导。因此，我想中国哲学史的研究工作者同古籍的训诂、校勘、考证工作者，应该密切合作，互相帮助。中国哲学思想史的研究工作者，应该关心古籍整理工作。一方面要虚心地从训诂、校勘、考证工作者那里求取帮助，另一方面又要主动地关心和帮助他们，而自己也应该尽可能地在训诂、校勘、考证方面作点深入细致的工作。
