    Wuhan, November 11th (By our newspaper) The workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, with the spirit of "loving coal and coke as much as loving grain," calculate fine accounts and implement measures, causing the coke ratio to continuously decrease. The coke ratio in September decreased by 48 kilograms compared to August, and in October it decreased by another 53 kilograms compared to September. In September and October, over 10,000 tons of coke were saved.
    When formulating the production increase and economy plan for the last four months of this year, the workers of the iron smelting plant fully discussed the issue of saving coke in September. They discovered in their detailed calculations that if the coke ratio of each ton of pig iron was reduced by 3.6%, the coke saved could be used to smelt more than 30,000 tons of pig iron. The detailed calculations made the workers realize the significant importance of saving coke. Then, the plant's Party committee organized technical cadres and workers to hold a special meeting to study and propose the implementation of the technical operating principles of "refined materials, large blast, high temperature" to achieve the goals of "stabilizing furnace temperature, increasing blast temperature, and reducing coke ratio." After the blast furnace workers used this method in production, they achieved good results. The three shifts operating on the No. 2 blast furnace launched a challenge performance competition to "stabilize furnace temperature and increase blast temperature," steadily increasing the blast temperature from around 820 degrees to around 870 degrees. The workers further adopted many measures, such as adjusting and stabilizing the charging system, improving the utilization rate of coal gas; adding less net coke when the furnace condition was not smooth, reducing coke consumption, and appropriately reducing blast humidity, relatively increasing the blast temperature, thus continuously reducing the coke ratio. The coke consumption per ton of pig iron in October decreased by 53 kilograms compared to September. In October, the amount of coke used was about the same as in September, but the output of pig iron increased by 11.19%.

    算细账抓措施焦比不断降低
    武钢两个月节约焦炭一万吨
    本报武汉11日电　武汉钢铁公司职工，以“爱煤爱焦如爱粮”的精神，算细账、抓措施，使焦比不断降低，9月比8月降低了四十八公斤，10月又比9月降低五十三公斤；9、10两月节约了一万多吨焦炭。
    9月份炼铁厂的职工在制订今年最后四个月增产节约计划的时候，充分讨论了节约焦炭的问题。他们在算细账中发现，如将每一吨生铁的焦比降低3.6％，节约的焦炭可炼出三万多吨生铁。通过算细账，使职工认识到节约焦炭的重大意义。接着厂党委组织技术干部和工人专门开会研究，提出了贯彻执行“精料、大风、高温”的技术操作方针，来达到“稳定炉温、提高风温、降低焦比”的目的。高炉职工在生产中运用这种办法以后，取得了良好效果。二号高炉炉内三班操作人员开展了“稳定炉温、提高风温”的攻关表演赛，将风温从八百二十度左右稳步提高到八百七十度左右。职工们进一步采取了许多措施，如调整和稳定了装料制度，提高了煤气的利用率；在炉况不顺时少加净焦，减少了焦炭消耗量，又适当减低了鼓风湿度，相对提高了风温，因此使焦比不断下降，每吨生铁耗焦量10月份比9月份降低五十三公斤。10月份只用了和9月份数量差不多的焦炭，而生铁的产量却增长了11.19％。
