Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th: The U.S. government continues to rudely interfere in Laotian internal affairs and has come out again to oppose the establishment of a coalition government in Laos with the participation of the Lao Patriotic Front.

U.S. State Department spokesman White said on the 25th, in answering a reporter's question about Laos, that he "wanted to say straightforwardly" that the United States did not support the proposal to establish a coalition government in Laos. White asked reporters to recall what he had said a few days earlier: "We (referring to the United States) view these developments with unease, because we are concerned that if this proposal were to be implemented, the Communist influence on Laotian internal affairs would increase."

    怀特叫喊美国不支持老挝成立联合政府建议
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府继续粗暴干涉老挝内政，再次出来反对在老挝建立有老挝爱国战线党参加的联合政府。
    美国国务院发言人怀特25日在回答记者提出的关于老挝的问题时说，他“希望直截了当地说”，美国并没有支持老挝成立联合政府的建议。怀特要记者们回想一下他前几天说过的这样的话：“我们（指美国）抱着不安的态度看待这些事态的发展。因为我们担心这种建议要是真的付诸实现的话，共产党对老挝内政的影响将会增加”。
