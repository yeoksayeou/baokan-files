New and Old Colonialists, Get Out of Africa!

"All reactionary things, if you don't hit them, they won't fall. It's like sweeping the floor, if the broom doesn't reach, the dust won't run away on its own."① This is a conclusion that Comrade Mao Zedong drew from the experience of the Chinese revolution fifteen years ago. Comrade Mao Zedong expressed a truth in a simple and clear way: imperialism and all reactionaries will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history.

Following Asia, the people of African countries, who have suffered from the colonial oppression of imperialism, have awakened, united, and carried out heroic and unyielding struggles against imperialism and colonialism. The storm of the African national revolution is shaking the last defenses of the imperialist colonial system.

In 1960, in vast Black Africa, from west to east, one after another, the flags of newly emerging republics were raised. In less than a year, sixteen countries, including the largest countries in Africa such as Congo and Nigeria, broke away from their colonial status and declared independence as a result of the people's struggle. This is the initial victory of the national independence movement in these countries. Now, there are twenty-six independent African countries, with a population accounting for about three-quarters of the total African population and an area accounting for about two-thirds of the total African area. In those African countries that have not yet achieved independence, the people's struggle against colonialism is continuing to flourish. The Algerian people are bravely persisting in the national liberation war against the French colonialists. In British Central and East Africa, large-scale worker strikes and mass demonstrations against colonial rulers have continuously broken out in Uganda, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Tanganyika, and Nyasaland in the past year. A few days ago, in Kenya, where British colonialists once carried out a bloody massacre after the war, more than 50,000 Africans held a political rally to resist colonial rule. Even the people in the Portuguese African colonies, where the national independence movement has always been relatively quiet, have voiced their demands for independence.

The African national independence movement has reached a nationwide scale, and the people's struggle is becoming more widespread and deep-rooted. Even in countries that have already achieved independence, such as Guinea, Congo, and Cameroon, the people have not stopped moving forward, but are eagerly demanding the complete elimination of colonial forces within the country and breaking away from imperialist economic constraints in order to achieve complete independence for their countries. It is very clear that Africa is at a great historical turning point, and the iron brooms of the African people are sweeping away the imperialist colonial forces entrenched there. The day when imperialism will be driven out of Africa is definitely not far away.

However, it must be recognized that Africa is the last stronghold of the imperialist colonial system. Imperialism will never voluntarily give up this colonial territory. As long as imperialist colonial forces are not completely eliminated in Africa, the independence and peace of African countries will not be reliably guaranteed. Isn't imperialism carrying out, or in fact carrying out, colonial wars of varying scales to suppress national independence movements in Algeria and Cameroon, in Congo and Angola, and in other regions? The imperialist policy towards the African national independence movement is: if it can be suppressed by force, it will be resolutely suppressed; if it cannot be suppressed, it will resort to various deceptive methods, and even adopt a strategy of retreating to advance when forced to, nominally agreeing to the declaration of independence of African countries, but in reality, it still uses various overt and covert schemes from political, economic, and military aspects to openly and secretly continue to maintain its colonial rule in Africa. And when the people of African countries rise up to strive for complete independence, imperialism will reveal its true colors and launch armed aggression regardless of the consequences. Aren't the imperialist bandits barbarously carrying out a bloody joint intervention against the Congolese people's patriotic and just struggle? Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the people of African countries can achieve a complete victory in national independence without repeated, tortuous, and serious struggles with imperialism and colonialism.

Imperialism and all colonialists have always regarded themselves as propagators of Western "civilization," as if without them, Africa would never get rid of backwardness and poverty. Old colonialists have mercilessly plundered and exploited the African people under this deceptive propaganda. Now, American neo-colonialists, taking advantage of the African people's urgent desire to get rid of backwardness and poverty, flaunt that they have no tangible colonies in Africa, put on the guise of so-called "sympathy" for the independence of African countries, and are launching a large-scale colonial expansion into Africa, replacing the positions of those old colonial countries and establishing new colonial rule over African countries. It is very clear that American imperialism has become the most dangerous enemy of the African people today.

American imperialism is running at full speed to expand into Africa. Eisenhower, Nixon, and Kennedy and their ilk are all vigorously advocating expansion into Africa. They are touting so-called "six-point plans," "five proposals," and so-called "tropical Africa plans," and so on. In addition to clamoring to invoke the precedent of intervention in the Congo and continue to use the United Nations as a tool for American monopoly capital to expand into Africa, they also emphasize so-called "bilateral activities" directly involving American intrusion. In order to cope with the financial crisis, the State Department has had to reduce its diplomatic personnel's travel overseas, but it stipulates that Africa is not an exception. According to an Associated Press dispatch on November 21, the U.S. State Department's doing so will "provide sufficient funds to establish strongholds in new African countries." American imperialist officials, as well as so-called economic, cultural, religious, and other "envoys" who pave the way for American colonial forces, are rushing into Africa.

American imperialism is so eager to invade and expand into Africa, which is inextricably linked to the further deepening of the current economic crisis in the United States. The current new economic crisis has already shrouded the White House, and in order to alleviate the new economic crisis, the U.S. government, in addition to continuing to frantically expand its arms race, will inevitably intensify its efforts to seize new markets, and Africa has become one of its main targets.

The example of the Congo completely exposed the ambitions of American neo-colonialists towards Africa. American neo-colonialists, in the name of "aiding" the Congo, used the United Nations to invade the country and establish the colonial rule of Wall Street monopoly capital over the Congo. As Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba revealed, today "bribery is rampant in the Congo, and the money for this bribery is coming from the United States." American imperialism is now taking advantage of the occupation of the Congo by the "United Nations forces" to try every means to "find" and support its agents in order to turn the Congo into a colony of the United States. The insidious and vicious methods of this American neo-colonialism have plunged the Congo into an unprecedentedly serious national crisis, and the independence of the Congo has been fatally threatened. And the invasion of the Congo is only a component of American imperialism's plan to enslave Africa.

More and more African countries have drawn profound lessons from the development of the situation in the Congo in recent months. That is: the "aid" of American imperialism, and the "aid" of the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States, will only bring new colonial shackles to the people who are eager for independence. The attainment of independence by African countries must rely on the strength of the people themselves, and must never rely on the "benevolence" of imperialism, especially American imperialism and the United Nations under its control. The brutality and insidiousness of American imperialism have been fully exposed in front of the people of African countries through the Congo incident, making the people of African countries further recognize the cunning and vicious means of American imperialism to achieve its aggressive goals through international organizations and by dividing the unity within the African national independence movement. This undoubtedly has far-reaching significance for the African national independence movement.

New and old colonialists are struggling desperately in the rumble of the advancing wheels of history. But the more brutal and cunning they are, the more they can educate the oppressed people to wake up, abandon illusions, and wage struggles. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own demise. The awakening of the people in the colonies and semi-colonies and the awakening of the people in the imperialist countries themselves are such conditions. Imperialism drives the masses of the people all over the world onto the historical era of the great struggle to eliminate imperialism."② That is precisely the case. The bloody rule of the old colonialists has driven the African people onto the road of resolute struggle; and the sinister plans of American neo-colonialists to invade Africa directly or through the United Nations will inevitably be increasingly seen through by the broad masses of African people, making the African people more aware, increasing their vigilance a hundredfold, uniting and continuing to launch a great struggle against imperialism, forcing new and old colonialists to get out of Africa!

The liberated Chinese people have always regarded the just struggle of the African people as their own struggle, and regarded every victory achieved by the African people in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism as their own victory. The Chinese people and the people of African countries will always support each other in the common struggle against imperialism. Today, people from all walks of life in our capital are holding a mass rally to support the Congolese people and the African people in their struggle to win and safeguard national independence and oppose imperialist aggression. This meeting will once again express the great determination of the 650 million Chinese people to sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Congolese people and the people of African countries, and express the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the people of African countries.

### 新老殖民者统统滚出非洲去！

    新老殖民者统统滚出非洲去！
    “凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”①这是毛泽东同志在十五年前从中国革命的经验中所得出的一个结论。毛泽东同志深入浅出地表述了一个真理，就是帝国主义和一切反动派是不会自动退出历史舞台的。
    继亚洲之后，吃尽了帝国主义殖民压迫的苦头的非洲各国人民觉醒起来了，团结起来了，进行了英勇不屈的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争。非洲民族革命的风暴，正在摇撼着帝国主义殖民体系的最后堤防。
    1960年，在广大的黑非洲，从西部到东部，一个接着一个地升起了新兴共和国的旗帜。仅仅在不到一年之内，就有十六个国家，其中包括刚果和尼日利亚这样非洲最大的国家，由于人民斗争的结果，摆脱了殖民地地位而宣告了独立。这是这些国家民族独立运动的初步胜利。现在，非洲独立国家已经有二十六个，这些国家的人口约占非洲总人口的四分之三；面积约占非洲总面积的三分之二。在那些尚未取得独立地位的非洲国家，人民反对殖民主义的斗争正在继续蓬勃地发展。阿尔及利亚人民英勇地坚持着反对法国殖民者的民族解放战争。在英属中非和东非，乌干达、南北罗得西亚、坦噶尼喀和尼亚萨兰等地最近一年间都不断地爆发较大规模的工人罢工斗争和反抗殖民统治者的群众性示威。前些天，在英国殖民者战后曾经进行过血腥大屠杀的怯尼亚，五万多非洲人举行了反抗殖民统治的政治集会。甚至在民族独立运动一向比较沉寂的葡属非洲殖民地的人民也发出了要求独立的吼声。
    非洲民族独立运动已经具有全民的规模，人民斗争更加广泛而深入了。即使在已经取得了独立地位的国家，如几内亚、刚果、喀麦隆，人民并没有停止前进的步伐，而是迫切地要求彻底肃清国内的殖民势力，摆脱帝国主义的经济束缚，以求得自己国家的完全独立。十分明显，非洲正处在一个伟大的历史转折点，非洲各国人民的铁扫帚，正在扫荡着盘踞在那里的帝国主义殖民势力。帝国主义滚出非洲的日子，已经肯定地不会很遥远了。
    但是，不能不看到，非洲是帝国主义殖民体系的最后阵地。帝国主义是绝不会自动放弃这块殖民阵地的。只要帝国主义殖民势力一天没有在非洲完全肃清，非洲各国的独立与和平就一天得不到可靠的保障。帝国主义不是正在阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆，在刚果和安哥拉以及其它地区进行着，或者事实上进行着镇压民族独立运动的规模不同的殖民战争吗？帝国主义对付非洲民族独立运动的方针是：能够用武力镇压下去的，则坚决镇压之；镇压不了的，就改用种种欺骗手法，甚至在迫不得已时采取以退为进的策略，表面上同意非洲国家宣告独立，而实际上仍从政治、经济和军事各个方面施展种种阳谋和阴谋，公开地和秘密地继续维护它们在非洲的殖民统治。而当非洲各国人民起来争取彻底的独立时，帝国主义就会原形毕露，不顾一切后果地发动武装侵略。帝国主义强盗们不是在野蛮地对刚果人民的爱国正义斗争实行血腥的联合干涉吗？因此，不能设想，非洲各国人民不经过同帝国主义和殖民主义的反复的曲折的和严重的斗争，就能取得民族独立的彻底胜利。
    帝国主义和一切殖民主义者，一直以西方“文明”的传播者自居，似乎没有他们，非洲永远也摆脱不了落后和贫困。老殖民主义者曾经在这种骗人的宣传下，无情地掠夺和压榨非洲人民。现在，美国新殖民主义者，利用非洲人民迫切要求摆脱落后和贫困的愿望，以自己在非洲没有有形的殖民地为标榜，披上了所谓“同情”非洲各国独立的外皮，向非洲大举进行殖民扩张，取代那些老牌殖民国家的地位，建立对非洲各国的新的殖民统治。很明显，美国帝国主义已经成为非洲人民当前最危险的敌人。
    美帝国主义正在开足马力向非洲进行扩张。艾森豪威尔、尼克松和肯尼迪之流，都在大肆鼓吹向非洲扩张。他们鼓吹什么“六点计划”、“五项建议”和所谓“热带非洲计划”等等。他们除了叫嚷要援用干涉刚果的先例，继续利用联合国作为美国垄断资本向非洲扩张的工具而外，也强调由美国直接侵入的所谓“双边活动”。美国为了应付财政危机，国务院不得不减少它的外交人员在海外的旅行，但是却规定非洲不在此例。据美联社11月21日的电讯透露，美国国务院这样做将“提供足够的基金在非洲新国家设立据点”。美帝国主义的官员，以及为美国殖民势力开道的所谓经济、文化、宗教等等“使者”，正在争先恐后地涌进非洲。
    美帝国主义如此急于向非洲侵略和扩张，这是同美国目前经济危机的进一步加深有着不可分割的联系的。当前新的经济危机已经笼罩着白宫的上空，美国政府为缓和新的经济危机，除了继续疯狂地扩军备战以外，必然地要加紧攫取新的市场，而非洲就成为它的主要对象之一。
    刚果的例子，完全暴露了美国新殖民主义者对于非洲的野心。美国新殖民主义者以“援助”刚果为名，利用联合国侵入了这个国家，建立华尔街垄断资本对刚果的殖民统治。正如刚果总理卢蒙巴所揭露，今天“在刚果是贿赂风行，为这种贿赂出钱的是美国”。美帝国主义现在正趁着“联合国军”对刚果的占领，千方百计地“寻找”和扶植自己的代理人，以便变刚果为美国的殖民地。美国的这种新殖民主义的阴险毒辣的手法已使刚果陷于空前严重的民族危机，刚果的独立遭到了致命的威胁。而对刚果的侵略，不过是美帝国主义奴役非洲计划的一个组成部分。
    越来越多的非洲国家，从几个月来刚果局势的发展中，吸取了深刻的教训。这就是：美帝国主义的“援助”，以及在美国操纵下的联合国的“援助”，都只会给渴望独立的人民，带来新的殖民枷锁。非洲各国独立的取得，必须依靠人民自己的力量，而绝不能依靠帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义及其操纵下的联合国的什么“恩赐”。美帝国主义的残暴和阴险已经通过刚果事件，完全暴露在非洲各国人民的面前，使得非洲各国人民进一步认清了美帝国主义通过国际组织和分裂非洲民族独立运动内部的团结的狡诈和毒辣手段，来达到它的侵略目的。这一点，对于非洲的民族独立运动来说，无疑是有着深远的意义的。
    新老殖民主义者，都正在历史巨轮前进的隆隆声里，声嘶力竭地挣扎着。但是，他们越残暴，越狡诈，也就越能够教育被压迫人民觉悟起来，丢掉幻想，进行斗争。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众的觉悟，就是这样的条件。帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。”②事情正是这样，老殖民主义者的血腥统治，驱使非洲人民走上了坚决斗争的道路；而美国新殖民主义者直接或者利用联合国侵入非洲的阴谋计划，也必将日益为广大非洲人民所识破，而使非洲的人民更加提高他们的觉悟，百倍提高他们的警惕性，团结起来，继续展开反对帝国主义的伟大斗争，迫使新老殖民主义者统统滚出非洲去！
    解放了的中国人民一向把非洲人民的正义斗争看作是自己的斗争，把非洲人民在反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中取得的每一项胜利，看作是自己的胜利。中国人民和非洲各国人民在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，永远是互相支持的。今天，我国首都各界人民举行支持刚果人民和非洲人民争取和维护民族独立，反对帝国主义侵略的群众大会。这个大会将再一次表达六亿五千万中国人民同情和支持刚果人民和非洲各国人民的正义斗争的伟大决心，表达中国人民和非洲各国人民之间的战斗的友谊。
