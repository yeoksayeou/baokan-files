Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch, Washington: The U.S. Treasury Department announced yesterday that U.S. gold reserves have fallen below the "danger point" of $18 billion. On November 21st, U.S. gold reserves were only $17.99 billion, the lowest point since February 7th, 1940.

U.S. gold is increasingly flowing out. According to U.S. news agencies, in July of this year, the number of dollars thrown out and gold purchased in the United States by other countries was equivalent to an annual rate of $3.8 billion, increasing to $4.1 billion in August, $4.7 billion in September, and as high as $5.9 billion in October.

The United States currently owes other countries approximately $20 billion in "short-term debt," which is more than the total U.S. gold reserves. If other countries demand that the United States pay with gold, U.S. gold reserves would be wiped out. At the same time, according to U.S. law, the U.S. government must also retain $11.6 billion in gold as reserve funds for its issued currency and bank deposits. The gold that can be used for other purposes is currently only $6.4 billion, which is $13.6 billion short of the U.S. "short-term debt."

The weakness of the U.S. financial position is causing increasing anxiety among U.S. newspapers. The Associated Press, in a recent series of reports commenting on this issue, said that a few years ago, "the dollar was almost 'as good as gold.' The United States was always ready to sell gold to other countries in exchange for dollars... because at that time, the United States was a prosperous island in a sea of postwar ruins." But today, Western European countries "can afford to buy American gold, and they are buying a lot of it." This American news agency continued, some countries are buying gold at a higher dollar ratio, which seems to be a "developing suspicion" of the dollar's credit.

The New York Times expressed concern that the U.S. gold reserves will be "completely depleted." The newspaper also pointed out that in the event of an economic crisis, the U.S.'s ability to solve the problem of large-scale gold outflows has been "further complicated."

Democrat President-elect Kennedy's economic advisor, Galbraith, exclaimed that the U.S.'s deep crisis of foreign payments and the situation of massive gold outflows "cannot continue." He said, "If the deficit continues, it will seriously affect our economy" and "greatly weaken our ability to maintain our payment position abroad." He said, "Our diplomatic position and policy depend on our ability to provide this kind of support," and U.S. foreign policy has always "relied on our need to support it with money."

In a report on the 24th, the Associated Press worriedly asked: "How long can the economic strength of the United States sustain the pressure of huge investments in the global Cold War competition?"

### 黄金滚滚外流　舆论惶惶不安  美黄金储备已下降到“危险点”以下

    黄金滚滚外流　舆论惶惶不安
    美黄金储备已下降到“危险点”以下
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国财政部昨天宣布，美国的黄金储备已下降到“危险点”一百八十亿美元以下。在11月21日，美国的黄金储备已只有一百七十九亿九千多万美元。这是1940年2月7日以来的最低点。
    美国黄金正越来越多地滚滚外流。据美国通讯社报道，在今年7月份，其他国家在美国抛出美元、购买黄金的数目以年率计算为三十八亿美元，8月份增加到四十一亿美元，9月份再增加到四十七亿美元，10月份更高达五十九亿美元。
    美国目前欠其他国家的“短期债务”约为二百亿美元，即比美国全部黄金储备还要多。如果其他国家要美国用黄金来偿付，美国的黄金储备就将一扫而光。同时，根据美国法律，美国政府还必须保留一百一十六亿美元的黄金来作为它发行的货币和银行存款的储备金，可以用在其他方面的黄金目前实际上只有六十四亿美元，即比美国的“短期债务”还亏短一百三十六亿美元。
    美国财政金融地位的虚弱愈益引起美国报刊的严重不安。美联社在最近发表的一系列评论这个问题的报道中说，在几年以前，“美元几乎是‘同黄金一样值钱’的。美国随时准备向其他国家出售黄金来换取美元……因为那时美国是战后废墟的大海中的繁荣之岛”。但是今天，西欧国家“已经能够买得起美国的黄金了，而且买得很多”。这家美国通讯社接着说，一些国家以更高比价的美元来购买黄金，看来这是一种对美元信用“发展起来的怀疑”。
    《纽约时报》表示担心美国的黄金储备将“全部耗尽”。这家报纸并且指出，在经济危机的情况下，美国要解决黄金大量外流的问题已“进一步复杂化”。
    民主党当选总统肯尼迪的经济顾问加耳布雷思惊呼美国对外支付危机深重、黄金大量外流的局面“不能继续下去”。他说，“如果赤字继续下去，这将使我们的经济受到严重影响”，“大大削弱我们在国外维持我们的支付地位的能力。”他说，“我们的外交地位和政策是要依靠我们作这种支持的能力的”，美国的外交政策一向“依靠我们需要以金钱来支持它的能力”。
    美联社在24日的报道中忧心忡忡地问道：“对于在全球的冷战竞争中的巨大投资的压力，美国的经济力量能够维持多久？”
