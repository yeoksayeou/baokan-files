Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 2nd: The competition movement centered on increasing coke production and entering 1961 ahead of schedule is vigorously unfolding in the coal mines of the Tonghua Mining Bureau in Jilin Province. Adhering to the spirit of striving to move forward as much as possible, the bureau's employees are working to ensure that more of this year's coal production is used for this year's steel production increase, and to make ample time for production preparations, so as to ensure that the production level in the first quarter of next year exceeds that of the fourth quarter of this year. Since the launch of this movement, the average daily output of coking coal in the bureau has increased by 8% compared with the same period in September, and the output of refined coal has increased by 17.2%, reaching the highest historical average daily output record for the bureau. Currently, nine wellheads and workshops, twenty-six coal mining and tunneling teams, and thirty-two auxiliary groups have entered 1961 seventy to two hundred days ahead of schedule.

In September of this year, when the Tonghua Mining Bureau Party Committee deployed the production for the fourth quarter, it carefully analyzed the law of continuous leap forward in production of the bureau over the past year. Since the fourth quarter of 1959, the bureau has maintained a gradual upward trend in production because it has firmly grasped the spirit of striving to move production forward as much as possible, and production preparation work has been carried out fully and proactively. In order to ensure that more of the coal produced in the current year is used for the increase in steel production in the current year, the Mining Bureau Party Committee decided to immediately strengthen the production preparation work for the fourth quarter, and on the basis of the production increase and conservation movement centered on grain and steel, launch a larger, wider, and more content-rich major competition to increase coal production and enter 1961 ahead of schedule. The Party Committee arranged more than 78% of the bureau's fourth-quarter production tasks in the first two months of the quarter to ensure the early completion of the annual state plan.

The scope and depth of this competition are unprecedented. From mining and tunneling to auxiliary workers, from production to construction workers, from leaders to general cadres, to the families of employees, the competitions are intertwined into a network, full of enthusiasm. This movement is closely integrated with the in-depth technological innovation and technological revolution movement carried out throughout the mine, and they promote each other. Since October, the bureau has organized hundreds of technical promotion teams, promoting forty-three advanced experiences such as hollow blasting, deep drilling and rapid blasting, and multi-pneumatic pick operation, which greatly improved coal mining and tunneling efficiency.

During the competition, each mine, well, team, and shift revised their plans according to the plan to enter 1961 ahead of schedule, and implemented them to the work teams and working faces on a ten-day and daily basis. Some wells, sections, and shifts have revised their plans again and again, making progress step by step.

The foundation of striving to move forward as much as possible is the production of work teams. Therefore, each coal mining and tunneling team widely carried out the "One Shift Red, Two Shifts Catch Up, Three Shifts Surpass, Four Shifts Guarantee" continuous competition and the "Five Guarantees" movement of shift guarantees team, team guarantees section, section guarantees well, well guarantees mine, and mine guarantees bureau. Leading cadres were assigned to shifts, followed up to the end, and focused on the production of the first and fourth shifts (night shifts) to drive the second and third shifts. If the first shift overproduced, the second, third, and fourth shifts would have a model, making it easier for them to catch up. The fourth shift plays a "connecting role," which is important for ensuring the completion of the upper shift's plan and preparing for the next shift. Therefore, the production level of the first and fourth shifts in the bureau has generally increased by about 20% compared with the same period in September. In grasping the production of work teams, cadres at all levels promptly summarized advanced experiences, such as holding "three meetings well": assigning tasks before the shift, checking measures during the shift, and summarizing and evaluating after the shift. Most groups have seen a new situation where there are cadres in every shift, the relationship between cadres and the masses is good; there is competition everywhere, and workers are motivated; there is a core in production, and tasks are completed well; everything is managed, and production order is good.

The major competition to enter 1961 ahead of schedule has promoted a greater increase in the production of coking coal and refined coal. In the first twenty-two days of October, the bureau's external transfer volume of coking raw coal had increased by 8,052 tons compared with the same period in September, and the volume of refined coal had increased by 12,948 tons, of which the volume of refined coal transported to Anshan Iron and Steel had increased by 9,321 tons.

The development of the competition movement has also greatly advanced the production preparation for 1961 in the bureau. Now, the 1961 production preparation leading group headed by the Director of the Mining Bureau, Zhang Changzhi, has been established, and various preparations for next year's production are underway.

    让更多的煤炭提前用于钢铁增产
    通化矿务局“提前跨进一九六一年竞赛”声势浩大规模空前
    新华社长春2日电　以增产焦炭为中心，提前跨进1961年的竞赛运动，正在吉林省通化矿务局各煤矿蓬勃展开。全局职工本着尽量往前赶的精神，争取今年生产的煤炭更多地用于今年的钢铁增产，并以充裕时间作好生产准备，促使明年首季的生产水平超过今年第四季度。这个运动开展以来，到10月22日，全局焦煤平均日产量比9月同期提高8％，精煤提高17.2％，创全局历史平均日产最高纪录。目前已有九个井口、车间，二十六个采煤、掘进队，三十二个辅助组分别提前七十到二百天跨进1961年。
    今年9月份，中共通化矿务局党委在部署第四季度生产时，认真分析了一年来全局生产持续跃进的规律。这个局从1959年第四季度以来，由于紧紧抓住生产尽量往前赶的精神，生产准备工作做得充分主动，使生产一直保持着逐步上升的局面。为了争取把当年生产的煤炭更多地用于当年的钢铁增产，矿务局党委决定立即加强第四季度的生产准备工作，并在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动基础上，掀起一个规模更大、范围更广、内容更多的提前跨进1961年的煤炭增产大竞赛。党委把全局第四季度78％以上的生产任务安排在本季度前两个月，以保证提前完成全年国家计划。
    这次竞赛范围之广，发动之深是前所未有的。从采掘到辅助工人、从生产到建设工人、从领导到一般干部、到职工家属，竞赛交织成网，热火朝天。这个运动与全矿深入开展的技术革新和技术革命运动紧密结合，相互促进。10月以来，全局共组织上百个技术推广队，推广了空心爆破、深打眼快放炮、多台风镐作业等四十三项先进经验，使采煤和掘进效率大大提高。
    在竞赛中，各矿、井、队、班都根据提前跨进1961年的计划，重新修改了自己的计划，并且按旬按日地落实到班组和掌子面。一部分井、段、班的计划一改再改，节节提前。
    尽量往前赶的根基，是班组生产。因此，各采煤、掘进班组广泛开展了“一班红，二班赶，三班超，四班包”的连环大竞赛和班保队、队保段、段保井、井保矿、矿保局的“五保”运动。领导干部分班包干，一跟到底，狠抓一、四班（夜班）生产，带动二、三班。一班超产，二、三、四班就有了样子，便于你追我赶。四班“承上启下”，对于保证完成上班计划和给下班做好准备有着重要作用。因此，全局一、四班的生产水平普遍比9月同期提高20％左右。在抓紧班组生产中，各级干部及时总结先进经验，如开好“三会”：班前落实任务，班中检查措施，班后总结评比。大部分小组出现了班班有干部，干群关系好；处处有竞赛，工人干劲好；生产有核心，任务完成好；事事有人管，生产秩序好的新局面。
    提前跨进1961年大竞赛，促进了焦煤、精煤更大幅度增产。10月头二十二天，全局焦原煤外调量已比9月同期增加八千零五十二吨，精煤增加一万二千九百四十八吨，其中运往鞍钢的精煤增加九千三百二十一吨。
    竞赛运动的开展，也使全局1961年生产准备大为提前。现在以矿务局局长张长智为首的1961年生产准备工作领导小组已经组成，明年生产的各项准备工作正在紧张进行。
