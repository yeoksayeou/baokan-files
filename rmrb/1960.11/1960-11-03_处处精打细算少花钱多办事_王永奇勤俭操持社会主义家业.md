Xinhua News Agency Report: Wang Yongqi (a member of the Bouyei ethnic group), the Party Branch Secretary of the Heping Production Team of the Anxi Commune in Zhenning County, Guizhou Province, has been diligently and thriftily managing socialist family property for ten years, transforming a poor mountain valley inhabited by ethnic minorities into a prosperous and advanced area. Over the past ten years, he has been named a model worker by the county and commune fourteen times. The Heping Production Team he leads has been recognized as a model unit of the commune since the Great Leap Forward. The team's Party Branch has also been recognized as a model branch of Zhenning County for two consecutive years.

More than 90% of the members of the Heping Production Team are from ethnic minorities. The team has many mountains and little arable land, backward production, and a poor standard of living. In the past, they only grew rice and corn, and the yields were extremely low, requiring the state to supply grain every year. Since Wang Yongqi became the leader of the mutual aid team in 1951, he has taken the lead in participating in production, both on the mountains and in the fields, and leading production. In the past, people did not grow wheat or rapeseed. He went down the mountain to learn from experience and returned to conduct experimental fields, promoting them throughout the team. In the past, people were accustomed to shallow plowing and sparse planting. He mobilized and united a group of activists to carry out intensive cultivation according to the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." In the past, they did not grow vegetables or flue-cured tobacco. Now, the team's gardens are full of fresh vegetables, and flue-cured tobacco production has become one of the team's main sources of income. Last year, the team's grain crop yield reached 1,000 catties per mu. This year, although the team suffered from a hundred-day drought and several sudden mountain floods, the majority of summer and autumn crops are growing well thanks to the team members' persistence in fighting the disaster. Due to the implementation of the principle of taking grain as the key link and promoting all-round development, the team's total income has been increasing year after year. The Great Leap Forward year of 1958 saw an increase of about 100% compared to 1957, and 1959 saw an increase of more than 30% compared to 1958. The team has had savings every year since it established the advanced cooperative, and every member has savings. Last year, the amount of grain sold to the state by the team, calculated on a per capita basis, was also more than that of any other production brigade.

In order to build socialism in this poor and backward mountain valley, Wang Yongqi has focused on "diligence" for ten years, participating in production and leading the local people of all ethnic groups to develop mountain production. On the other hand, he started with "thrift," practicing strict economy everywhere and accomplishing more with less. Last year, the team planted flue-cured tobacco for the first time. According to agricultural technicians, each mu would require at least 300 catties of oil cake. Wang Yongqi calculated that 190 mu of flue-cured tobacco would cost more than 1,700 yuan. He discussed this with the team's cadres for a long time and found that the fertilizer effect of oil cake was similar to that of ordinary manure. He decided to buy only 1,500 catties of oil cake to dissolve in water and apply to the tobacco seedlings, and use 700,000 catties of manure and green manure instead. As a result, they saved more than 1,700 yuan in investment, and the flue-cured tobacco also yielded a bumper harvest.

Wang Yongqi has always adhered to a strict approval system for all expenditures of the production team. Expenditures of more than ten yuan must be approved by the team committee, and expenditures of more than one hundred yuan must be approved by all team members. Due to his constant urging and education, the accounting books are published monthly, and every item is clear, which satisfies the masses. The team's accountant has also been rated as a model accountant by the commune and management area three times in a row since 1958. However, Wang Yongqi is also hesitant when it comes to spending money where it is needed. This year, the team suffered from a continuous drought of more than 100 days, and only 40% of the paddy fields were plowed by the end of June. If water-lifting tools were not added, the full planting of rice would be missed. However, the team members of various ethnic groups in the local area have always only used wooden buckets to draw water and are not accustomed to using waterwheels, believing that waterwheels are more expensive and advocating not buying them. Wang Yongqi calculated the income from grain after drought resistance for everyone, and suggested that the production team first buy a waterwheel and let him operate it practically for everyone to see. As a result, the team members' thinking was opened up, and the team bought 11 waterwheels, and plowed the remaining dry fields in a few days, basically achieving full planting. When the team planted a large amount of autumn vegetables such as white radish and carrots, there were still 60 mu of vacant land that had not been planted due to insufficient seeds. Although carrot seeds were more expensive, Wang Yongqi also suggested that the team buy them in full and distribute them to each small team according to actual needs.

Wang Yongqi's own life is also very simple. He eats the same food in the collective canteen as the team members, and he participates in production all day long. Last year, he worked 220 workdays. Since the beginning of this year, he has participated in field labor for an average of 25 or 26 days per month. Since he became the production team leader, he has never asked for extra subsidies. He receives the same labor remuneration as ordinary team members during the annual production distribution.

Under the influence of Wang Yongqi, the cadres and members of the Heping Production Team have formed a habit of being honest in performing their duties and practicing diligence and thrift.

    处处精打细算少花钱多办事
    王永奇勤俭操持社会主义家业
    据新华社讯　贵州省镇宁县安西公社和平生产队党支部书记王永奇（布依族），克勤克俭操持社会主义家业十年如一日，使一个少数民族聚居的穷山沟，变成了兴旺的先进区。十年来他曾十四次被县、公社评为模范工作者，他领导的和平生产队从大跃进以来，一直被评为公社的标兵单位，这个队的党支部也连续两年被评为镇宁县的模范支部。
    和平生产队少数民族社员占90％以上。全队山多耕地少，生产落后，人民生活贫困。这里原来只种水稻、玉米，而且产量极低，每年需要国家供应粮食。王永奇从1951年当互助组长起，就带头上山下田参加生产，领导生产。过去人们不种小麦、油菜，他就下山取经，回来搞试验田，在全队推广；过去人们习惯浅耕稀植，他就动员和团结一批积极分子，按农业“八字宪法”精耕细作；从前这里不种蔬菜、烤烟，现在全队鲜菜满园，烤烟生产已成为全队的主要收入之一。去年这个队的粮食作物亩产达到一千斤。今年虽然连遭百日大旱和几次山洪的突然侵袭，但经全队社员坚持抗灾，大部分夏秋作物还是长得不错。由于贯彻了以粮为纲全面发展的方针，全队总收入连年上升。大跃进的1958年比1957年增加一倍左右，1959年又比1958年增加三成多。全队从办起高级社以后，年年有积存，社员家家有存款。去年全队卖给国家的粮食，按平均人口计算，也比其他任何一个生产大队多。
    为了在这个贫困落后的穷山沟里建设社会主义，王永奇十年来一方面从“勤”字着眼，参加生产，领导当地各族人民发展山区生产；一方面从“俭”字下手，处处精打细算，少花钱多办事。去年，队里第一次种烤烟，据农业技术人员介绍，每亩最低要用三百斤油饼。王永奇一算账，一百九十亩烤烟就得花一千七百多元。他和队的干部商量了很久，发现油饼的肥效和一般圈肥差不多，便决定只买一千五百斤油饼溶水追烟苗，其余用七十万斤圈肥、绿肥代替。结果既节省了投资一千七百多元，烤烟也得到了大丰收。
    王永奇对生产队的各项开支，一贯坚持严格的审批制度。开支十元以上要经过队委会通过，百元以上要全队社员同意。由于他的不断督促和教育，会计账目月月公布，笔笔清楚，群众都很满意。队的会计员从1958年到现在也连续三次被公社、管理区评为模范会计。但是对该用的钱，王永奇又毫不犹豫。今年全队遭受持续百多天的大旱，到6月底水田才翻犁40％，如果不添置提水工具，水稻满栽满插将要落空。但是，当地各兄弟民族的社员历来只用木桶戽水，没有使用水车的习惯，认为水车价钱较高，主张不买。王永奇一面给大家算了抗旱后的粮食收入账，一面建议生产队先买回一部水车，由他实际操作给大家看。结果打通了社员思想，全队买回十一部水车，几天内就把剩下的干田车水犁完，基本上做到满栽满插。当队里大种白萝卜、胡萝卜等秋菜时，因为种子不够，还有六十亩空地没种上。虽然胡萝卜种子价格较高，王永奇也建议队里如数购买，按实际需要分发各小队。
    王永奇自己的生活也很朴素。他在集体食堂和社员们吃一样的饭菜，自己成天参加生产，去年一年他做了二百二十个劳动日，今年以来，每月平均有二十五、六天参加田间劳动。他当生产队长后从来不要额外补助，每年生产分配时，和一般社员一样分到一份劳动报酬。
    在王永奇的影响下，和平生产队的干部和社员廉洁奉公、克勤克俭已形成风气。
