On the Problem of Peasant Revolutionary Wars in Chinese Feudal Society
Shi Shaobin

In recent years, China's historical circles have launched extensive research and heated discussions on peasant revolutionary wars in Chinese feudal society. The problem of peasant revolutionary wars is an extremely important issue in studying the history of Chinese feudal society. In China's feudal society, the scale and frequency of peasant uprisings and peasant wars were unprecedented in world history. Studying these peasant uprisings and peasant wars can not only profoundly reveal the development laws of Chinese feudal society but also enrich Marxist-Leninist theories of class struggle and basic theories of feudal society. At the same time, studying the history of peasants' revolutionary struggles is of great practical significance for carrying forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Chinese people and educating the broad masses of people about class struggle.

Currently, research and discussions are continuing. The following is a summary of the discussion on several important issues.

The Historical Role of Peasant Revolutionary Wars in China

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that in Chinese feudal society, only the class struggle of the peasants, peasant uprisings, and peasant wars were the real driving force of historical development. Therefore, specifically elucidating the great historical role of peasant revolutionary wars is one of the main problems to be solved in the study of the history of peasant revolutionary wars in China. Over the years, China's historical circles have done a lot of research on this issue. Due to different understandings of the political economy of various periods of Chinese feudal society and its relationship with peasant wars, they have different opinions when specifically demonstrating this problem.

One view is that the role of peasant revolutionary wars is mainly manifested in the fact that each major peasant uprising and peasant war severely attacked the feudal rule at that time, forcing the feudal rulers to implement certain reforms and concessions in politics and economy. This allowed the relations of production to be adjusted to some extent, thereby promoting the development of social productive forces to some extent. This was a relatively common view in historical circles in the past.

In recent years, with the deepening of research on the history of peasant revolutionary wars in China, some comrades believe that it is far from enough to make only the above-mentioned general expositions, especially only from the perspective of the ruling class's reforms and concessions. Therefore, some comrades have tried to study according to the development process of feudalism. They believe that the development of feudalism has an ascending stage and a descending stage. In the ascending stage of feudalism, peasant revolutionary wars played a role in ensuring the development of feudal relations of production and promoting the development of productive forces. Specifically, it is manifested in: basically eliminating the remnants of the slavery system, greatly weakening the peasants' dependence on the landlords, and forcing the rulers to make some concessions. In the descending stage of feudalism, peasant revolutionary wars played a role in shaking the feudal system and promoting the growth of capitalist sprouts. Specifically, it is manifested in: attacking the feudal system, promoting its gradual disintegration, and increasing the purchasing power of the people; attacking the feudal rulers' monopoly on industry and commerce, and opening up roads for the development of industry and commerce.

Other comrades advocate studying from the perspective of the size of peasant revolutionary wars, different endings, and the degree of impact on feudal rule. They believe that large-scale peasant revolutionary wars have a greater driving effect on society than small-scale ones, and peasant revolutionary wars that achieve a certain victory ending have a greater driving effect than those that fail midway. A very few people even believe that only large-scale peasant revolutionary wars have a driving effect on social development, and this effect is not visible in smaller-scale ones.

Some comrades also believe that the role played by peasant revolutionary wars in China in history is multifaceted. In politics, it is manifested in overthrowing and transforming feudal ruling dynasties; in social production, it is manifested in the increase of cultivated land area, the improvement of production technology, the improvement of production tools, the construction of water conservancy projects, and the growth of population; in ideology, it is manifested in the impact on progressive literature, philosophy, history, etc. In addition, peasant revolutionary wars also play a great role in maintaining national unity, promoting ethnic integration, and strengthening friendship between ethnic groups.

There is also an opinion that advocates using whether peasant revolutionary wars overthrow feudal dynasties as a standard to measure whether peasant revolutionary wars are progressive. This opinion has been criticized by many comrades. They pointed out that this would obliterate the role of all peasant revolutionary wars that were suppressed by the ruling class in history.

The Nature of Peasant Revolutionary Wars in China

This is one of the most debated issues in China's historical circles today. The main issue of contention is whether peasant revolutionary wars in Chinese feudal society have the nature of opposing the feudal system (or anti-feudalism).

The first view is that peasant revolutionary wars in Chinese feudal society have never had the nature of opposing the feudal system from beginning to end. This view emphasizes that peasants are a spontaneous class, believing that peasants have stubbornly fought against the feudal autocratic regime, but they have not fought against the feudal system; peasant revolutionary wars objectively play a role in attacking and weakening the feudal system, but peasants subjectively do not have the consciousness of abolishing the feudal system. The highest demand of peasant revolution is nothing more than wanting a good emperor.

The second view is that peasant revolutionary wars in the early period of Chinese feudal society do not have the nature of opposing the feudal system, but peasant revolutionary wars in the later period do have the nature of opposing the feudal system. This view believes that when the feudal mode of production is in the ascending stage of its own development, peasants do not perceive the irrationality of the feudal system. Therefore, peasants at this time did not put forward slogans against feudal ownership relations, and their uprisings did not have an anti-feudal nature. When the feudal mode of production declined, peasants put forward slogans such as "equalizing the poor and the rich" and "equalizing land," which have an anti-feudal nature, and peasant uprisings have an anti-feudal nature. If it is believed that peasant uprisings in the early feudal society were actually opposed to the feudal system, then it would logically lead to the conclusion that peasant uprisings in the early feudal society were not progressive because they opposed the progressive mode of production.

In sharp contrast to the above two views, the third view is that peasant revolutionary wars in Chinese feudal society have had the nature of opposing the feudal system from beginning to end. The majority of comrades participating in the discussion hold this view. They believe that the antagonistic contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class existed throughout the feudal society; therefore, peasant revolutionary wars could not but have an anti-feudal nature from beginning to end. They disagree with the first view, believing that this view separates the feudal regime from the feudal system, and does not see that the feudal system is an inseparable whole from economy to politics, and that peasant revolutionary wars against the feudal regime are essentially against the feudal system. This view actually confuses the two issues of the peasant class demanding to establish a new social system by opposing the feudal system, and the peasants' historical limitations that prevent them from overthrowing the feudal system and establishing a new social system. They also disagree with the view that peasant revolutionary wars in the early feudal society do not have an anti-feudal nature, believing that the fundamental contradiction of the feudal mode of production exists from beginning to end, but the degree of intensification of this contradiction is different in the early and late feudal society; therefore, the anti-feudal situation manifested in class struggle is also different. As for the claim that advocating that peasant wars in the early feudal society are anti-feudal would lead to the conclusion that peasant wars are against progressive systems, this obviously only sees the side where the relations of production and productive forces are adapted in the early feudal society, and does not see the side where the feudal relations of production and productive forces are still contradictory. At the same time, the progressive role of peasant wars and the anti-feudal nature should not be opposed; peasant uprisings can only play a progressive role on the premise of being anti-feudal.

However, among the comrades who agree that peasant revolutionary wars have an anti-feudal nature from beginning to end, there are also different views on the content of peasant revolutionary wars' opposition to the feudal system. Some believe that the main content of peasant revolutionary wars' opposition to the feudal system is: changing landlord land ownership to peasant land ownership, overthrowing the reactionary regime of the landlord class, and abolishing the feudal hierarchical system. Some emphasize that peasants are a class of small producers, believing that the peasant revolutionary struggle can only be limited to the scope of the feudal economic system. Therefore, they believe that the basic content of peasants' opposition to the feudal system is to oppose the feudal land relations, so that they can become small land owners and maintain and develop their own small economy.

The Stages of Development of Peasant Revolutionary Wars in China

This is an important issue that has recently been raised for discussion in China's historical circles. Correctly dividing the stages of development of peasant revolutionary wars in Chinese feudal society will help to understand the characteristics of peasant wars in various periods and to understand the development laws of class struggle in feudal society. In the discussion, everyone admitted that peasant revolutionary wars in Chinese feudal society have a development process from a lower stage to a higher stage. However, due to different understandings of the criteria for dividing stages and the characteristics of peasant wars in each stage, they have extremely inconsistent opinions when specifically dividing stages.

The majority of comrades participating in the discussion advocate dividing peasant revolutionary wars in China into two stages. They mainly use the content opposed by peasant revolutionary wars and the program slogans reflecting the demands of peasants as the dividing criteria. One view advocates that the period from the Chen Sheng and Wu Guang Uprising at the end of the Qin Dynasty to the Huang Chao Uprising at the end of the Tang Dynasty is the first stage. The characteristic of peasant uprisings in this stage is that they have never raised the issue of land. The period from the Li Shun and Wang Xiaobo Uprising in the Northern Song Dynasty to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the Qing Dynasty is the second stage. The characteristic of peasant uprisings in this stage is that they put forward political programs such as "equalizing wealth" and "equalizing land." Another view believes that peasant uprisings in Chinese feudal society can be divided into two periods, before and after the middle of the Tang Dynasty. Peasant uprisings in the earlier period mainly manifested in anti-corvée labor and striving for personal rights; therefore, the ideas contained in their slogans were mainly a violent "property commonality" or "common labor" doctrine; peasant uprisings in the later period mainly manifested in dividing and equalizing property; therefore, the ideas contained in their slogans were a more realistic doctrine of property equalization. Moreover, some comrades believe that the reason why peasant uprisings in the earlier and later periods are different in their program slogans is that state land ownership occupied a dominant position before the middle of the Tang Dynasty, while landlord land private ownership occupied a dominant position after the middle of the Tang Dynasty.

Among the comrades who advocate dividing peasant wars into two periods, before and after the middle of the Tang Dynasty, some also divided each of the earlier and later periods into two segments. The earlier period is divided into two segments: from the Qin to the Two Han Dynasties, and from the Three Kingdoms to the middle of the Tang Dynasty: the main content of the former segment is to strive for survival rights and oppose annexation, and the latter segment is anti-slavery and anti-personal dependence; the later period is divided into two segments: from the Tang to the Yuan Dynasties, and from the Ming Dynasty to the Opium War: the main content of the former segment is to demand property equality and personal equality, and the latter segment is to oppose feudal land ownership and taxation.

There are two views that advocate dividing into three segments. One view is to examine the political demands of peasant uprisings in combination with the development stages of feudal society. This view believes that peasant uprisings before the Tang Dynasty were in the lower stage. The political demands of peasants are mainly struggles to strive for survival rights, which is consistent with the early stage of the development of Chinese feudal society. With the development of Chinese feudal society towards its peak stage, the class struggle of peasants also developed from a lower stage to a higher stage, which is the peasant uprising of the Tang and Song Dynasties. In this stage, peasants put forward the slogan of equalizing property for the first time in Chinese history, which far exceeded the demands put forward by peasant uprisings in previous generations. With the gradual disintegration of Chinese feudal society, the class struggle of peasants also developed to a higher stage, which is the peasant uprising in the late Ming Dynasty. At this time, peasants comprehensively impacted all aspects of the feudal system, which is manifested in: opposing feudal land ownership; opposing feudal distribution relations, carrying out rent reduction and anti-rent struggles; opposing feudal personal enslavement relations, and demanding personal liberation. Another view believes that the content opposed by peasant wars can be used as a standard for dividing stages, divided into three segments: the main feature of peasant wars before the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty is anti-feudal dependency and anti-slave remnants. The main feature of peasant wars from the Three Kingdoms to the end of the Tang Dynasty is attacking the feudal large land ownership and the rule of powerful families and clans. The struggle of peasant wars after the Song Dynasty against feudal land ownership and autocratic rule was more intense and high, which was mixed with the struggle against backward economic relations.

Comrades who advocate dividing into four segments divide the development stages of peasant revolutionary wars according to the periodization of Chinese feudal society. They believe that the main contradictions in various periods of feudal society determine the characteristics of peasant revolutionary wars in various periods. Therefore, they divide peasant wars into four periods: (1) The early stage of feudal society (from the Warring States period to the Yellow Turban Uprising at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty), the main contradiction is between peasants and powerful aristocratic landlord class, the main purpose of peasant uprisings is anti-slavery, anti-hunger and struggle for survival, the characteristic of peasant uprisings is that they have a strong primitive nature. (2) The growth stage of feudal society (from the Three Kingdoms to the Huang Chao Uprising at the end of the Tang Dynasty), the main contradiction is between aristocratic landlords and peasants, the main demand of peasant wars is to oppose the oppression of aristocratic landlords and strive for personal rights. (3) The development stage of feudal society (from the Song to the Red Turban Army Uprising at the end of the Yuan Dynasty), the tenant-landlord relationship has been very common, economic dependence has been strengthened, and the state's corvée and other exploitation are also very heavy; therefore, peasant wars in this period are mainly against the feudal tenant-landlord relationship, opposing cruel exploitation, and put forward slogans such as "equalizing the noble and the base, and equalizing the poor and the rich." (4) The late stage of feudal society (from the Ming to the Qing Dynasty), the slogans and programs of peasant uprisings are clearer than before, and the main demand of peasant uprisings is to oppose the high concentration of land and to fight for land.

The Problem of Peasant Power in Peasant Revolutionary Wars in China

In the revolutionary wars, the peasants of our feudal society often established certain political organizations to resist feudal rule. This is a prominent feature of the peasant revolutionary wars in Chinese feudal society, which must be correctly elucidated. At present, the discussion on this issue in historical circles is mainly focused on two issues: Can peasants establish their own power in feudal society? What is the nature of the political organizations established by peasants in revolutionary wars in our feudal society?

One view is that peasants cannot establish their own power under the feudal system. Their main reasons are: First, politics is a concentrated expression of economics, and the power as a superstructure is determined by the economic base. In the feudal era, because peasants are a constantly divided class of small private owners and small producers, peasant power is impossible to appear. Second, the struggle of peasants is a spontaneous activity, which can only be limited to the scope of the feudal economic system, limited to maintaining and developing their own small private ownership and small economy. They cannot understand the feudal superstructure, so they have no requirements to change the state system, and will not and cannot establish power.

Comrades holding this view believe that the political organizations established by peasants in revolutionary wars in our feudal society are not "power," but only temporary military institutions for military service, which are a form of struggle. Some believe that this political organization can be called a short-term power, but cannot be called "peasant power," because these short-term powers cannot transform the broad masses of peasants into the ruling class. In the minds of the peasants and in reality, there can only be a "good emperor." That is to say, there are only differences between the "new power" and the "old power," but no substantial differences.

Contrary to the above view, many comrades believe that peasants in feudal society can establish power. They believe that power is the ruling power of a certain class. Any organization with political institutions, political facilities, and political programs should be called power. They also pointed out that because peasants are a class of small producers, the power established by peasants can only be short-term. However, this should not be confused with whether peasants can establish a new social system and whether they can establish a power as the highest violent institution of the new social system. They also believe that peasant wars are the highest form of class struggle; therefore, the struggle of peasants is by no means limited to economic struggle, but also requires overthrowing the rule of the landlord class, changing their political status, and establishing their own power.

Comrades holding this view believe that the political organizations established by peasants in revolutionary wars in our feudal society are short-term peasant powers. They also believe that due to the limitations of historical conditions, peasants themselves do not have a clear direction; therefore, peasant power can only exist in the process of armed struggle, and is often a combination of military and government. These comrades also emphasized that although peasant power is established by imitating the organizational form of the central or local government agencies of the landlord class, it is essentially different from the power of the landlord class, that is, it leads peasants to oppose the feudal dynasty, implements political oppression on the landlord class, implements some economic policies that conform to the interests of peasants, and adopts a primitive and simple democratic form of "public deliberation," etc.

The discussion involves many issues. In addition, there are the relationship between peasant wars and religion, the relationship between the class struggle of peasants and national struggle, etc. However, it can be seen from the above introduction that in recent years, the research on the history of peasant revolutionary wars in Chinese feudal society has been greatly strengthened, and certain achievements have been made. In order to make the discussion more in-depth and more extensive, we would like to put forward the following suggestions. First, it is necessary to carry out in-depth research and discussion on some important and urgent problems to be solved, and to solve them in a concentrated manner. For example, the historical role of peasant wars in China is one of the issues worthy of concentrated discussion. Second, it is necessary to conduct in-depth research on some larger peasant revolutionary wars, such as the Yellow Turban Uprising, the Huang Chao Uprising, etc.

Strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works are of particular importance for the study of the history of peasant revolutionary wars in China. We must earnestly understand the spiritual essence of Mao Zedong Thought, learn to study peasant problems like Comrade Mao Zedong, conduct creative analysis and synthesis of historical facts, draw out laws from them, and establish the discipline of the history of peasant revolutionary wars in China.

When studying the history of peasant revolutionary wars in China, it is necessary to strengthen the struggle against reactionary historiography at home and abroad. Before liberation, reactionary historians at home and abroad had been viciously slandering the history of peasant revolutionary struggles in our country to serve their reactionary political purposes. After liberation, there is no longer anyone in our country who openly promotes these reactionary historical views, but the influence of these views still exists to a certain extent in some works, such as uglifying the peasant class, beautifying the landlord class, blurring class struggle, depicting peasant revolutionary wars as extremely cruel and terrifying, spreading sentimentalism, and obliterating the great historical role of peasant revolutionary wars, etc. Obviously, only by waging a resolute struggle against these reactionary views and only by eliminating the influence of these views can we truly elucidate the history of peasant revolutionary struggles and improve the level of research.

In research and discussion, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy. Repeated debates should be carried out on all major issues. For relevant historical facts, manpower should be concentrated to sort them out separately; for relevant instructions in classic works, they should be concentrated for study and discussion. Different opinions, as long as they are well-founded and reasonable, should be allowed to be published, and do not rush to draw conclusions. Relevant publications need to actively organize and promote research in this area. We believe that as long as we adhere to Mao Zedong Thought and work together, the research on the history of peasant revolutionary wars in China will surely achieve more significant achievements.

    关于中国封建社会农民革命战争问题的讨论
    史绍宾
    近年来，我国历史学界对中国封建社会的农民革命战争，展开了广泛的研究和热烈的讨论。农民革命战争问题，是研究中国封建社会历史的一个极其重要的问题。在我国封建社会，农民起义和农民战争的规模之大，次数之多，是世界历史上所仅见的。研究这些农民起义、农民战争，不仅能够深刻地揭示出中国封建社会的发展规律，而且能够丰富马克思列宁主义的阶级斗争学说和封建社会的基本理论。同时，研究农民的革命斗争历史，对于发扬我国人民光荣的革命传统，对广大人民进行阶级斗争的教育，也具有很大的现实意义。
    目前研究和讨论正在继续开展。现将几个重要问题的讨论情况作一概括的介绍。
    中国农民革命战争的历史作用
    毛泽东同志指出，在中国封建社会里，只有农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。因此，具体地阐明农民革命战争的伟大历史作用，是研究中国农民革命战争史所要解决的主要问题之一。历年来，我国历史学界在这个问题上做了不少研究。由于对中国封建社会各时期的政治经济及其和农民战争的关系认识不同，他们在具体论证这一问题时便有不同的意见。
    一种意见认为，农民革命战争的作用，主要表现在每次较大的农民起义和农民战争都严重地打击了当时的封建统治，迫使封建统治者不得不在政治上经济上实行若干改良和让步。这就使生产关系得到若干调整，从而使社会生产力得到一些发展。这是过去在史学界比较普遍的一种看法。
    最近几年，随着中国农民革命战争史研究的深入，有些同志认为，仅作上面那种一般的阐述，特别是仅从统治阶级的改良和让步方面来考察，是很不够的。因此，有的同志便尝试按封建制的发展过程来研究。他们认为，封建制的发展有上行阶段和下行阶段。在封建制的上行阶段，农民革命战争起着保证封建生产关系促进生产力发展的作用。具体表现在：基本上消灭了奴隶制度的残余，大大削弱了农民对地主的依附关系，迫使统治者做出一些让步。在封建制的下行阶段，农民革命战争起着动摇封建制度，促进资本主义萌芽成长的作用。具体表现在：打击了封建制度，促使它日趋瓦解，提高了人民的购买力；打击了封建统治者对工商业的垄断，为工商业的发展开辟了道路。
    另外一些同志，主张从农民革命战争规模的大小、不同的结局和对封建统治打击的程度来进行研究。他们认为，规模大的农民革命战争比规模小的，取得一定胜利结局的农民革命战争比中途失败的，对社会要起着更大一些的推动作用。更有个别人认为，只有大规模的农民革命战争才对社会发展有推动作用，规模较小的就看不出这种作用。
    还有一些同志认为，中国农民革命战争在历史上所起的作用是多方面的。在政治上，表现为推翻和改造封建统治王朝；在社会生产上，表现为耕地面积的增加，生产技术的提高，生产工具的改进，水利的兴修，人口的增长等等；在意识形态上，表现为对进步的文学、哲学、历史学等发生影响。此外，在保持全国统一，促进各族融合，加强民族间的友谊等方面，农民革命战争也起着很大作用。
    也有一种意见，主张以农民革命战争是否推翻封建王朝，作为衡量农民革命战争是否具有进步性的标准。这种意见受到许多同志的批评。他们指出，这将把历史上一切为统治阶级镇压下去的农民革命战争的作用，一笔抹杀。
    中国农民革命战争的性质
    这是目前我国史学界争论最多的一个问题。争论的主要问题是，中国封建社会的农民革命战争，是否具有反对封建制度（或反封建）的性质。
    第一种意见认为，中国封建社会农民革命战争自始至终都不具有反对封建制度的性质。这种意见强调农民是自在的阶级，认为农民曾顽强地向封建专制主义政权进行了战斗，可是他们没有同封建制度进行战斗；农民革命战争在客观上起着打击与削弱封建制度的作用，可是农民在主观上没有废除封建制度的意识。农民革命的最高要求不过是要一个好皇帝而已。
    第二种意见认为，中国封建社会前期的农民革命战争不具有反对封建制度的性质，后期的农民革命战争才具有反对封建制度的性质。这种意见认为，当封建生产方式处在自身发展的上升阶段时期，农民觉察不到封建制度的不合理处。所以，这个时候的农民没有提出反对封建所有制关系的口号，他们的起义不具有反封建的性质。当封建生产方式走向衰落的时候，农民才提出“均贫富”“均田”等具有反封建性质的口号，农民起义才具有反封建性质。如果认为封建社会早期的农民起义竟然要反对封建制度，那就会在逻辑上得出这样结论：封建社会早期的农民起义不是进步的，因为他们反对进步的生产方式。
    和上述两种意见针锋相对，第三种意见认为，中国封建社会的农民革命战争，自始至终都具有反对封建制度的性质。参加讨论的多数同志都持有这种意见。他们认为，农民阶级与地主阶级的对抗性矛盾在封建社会自始至终存在，因此，农民革命战争自始至终就不能不具有反封建性质。他们不同意第一种意见，认为这种意见是把封建政权和封建制度割裂开来，没有看到封建制度从经济到政治是不可分割的整体，农民革命战争反对封建政权实质上就是在反对封建制度。这种观点实际上是把农民阶级反对封建制度要求建立新的社会制度，和农民因历史的局限性不能推翻封建制度建立新的社会制度两个问题混淆起来了。他们也不同意封建社会早期的农民革命战争不具有反封建性质的观点，认为封建生产方式的根本矛盾自始至终存在，只不过在封建社会的前期和后期这种矛盾的激化程度不同，因而阶级斗争所表现的反封建情况也有所不同。至于说主张封建社会早期的农民战争是反封建的，就会得出农民战争是反对进步制度的结论，这显然是只看到封建社会初期生产关系和生产力相适应的一面，没有看到封建生产关系和生产力还有相矛盾的一面。同时，不应该把农民战争的进步作用和反封建性质对立起来，农民起义只有在反封建的前提下才会起进步作用。
    但是，同意农民革命战争自始至终具有反封建性质的同志中，对农民革命战争反对封建制度的内容，也还有不同看法。有的认为，农民革命战争反对封建制度的主要内容是：改变地主土地所有制为农民土地所有制，推翻地主阶级的反动政权，取消封建的等级制度。有的强调农民是小生产者阶级，认为农民革命斗争只能局限于封建经济制度范围内。因此，他们认为农民反对封建制度的基本内容，是反对封建土地关系，使自己成为小土地所有者，维护和发展自己的小经济。
    中国农民革命战争发展的阶段性
    这是我国史学界新近提出来讨论的一个重要问题。正确地划分中国封建社会农民革命战争发展的阶段，将有助于了解各时期农民战争的特点，认识封建社会阶级斗争的发展规律。在讨论中，大家都承认中国封建社会农民革命战争有一个从低级阶段到高级阶段的发展过程。但是，由于对划分阶段的标准和对各阶段农民战争的特点认识不同，他们在具体划分阶段时就有极不一致的意见。
    参加讨论的多数同志，主张把中国农民革命战争划分为两个阶段。他们主要以农民革命战争所反对的内容和反映农民要求的纲领口号作为划分标准。其中一种意见主张，从秦末的陈胜、吴广起义到唐末的黄巢起义为前段，这一阶段农民起义的特点是都未曾提出过土地问题。从北宋的李顺、王小波起义到清代的太平天国为后段，这一阶段农民起义的特点是提出了“均财富”“均田”之类的政治纲领。另一种意见认为，中国封建社会的农民起义，可以唐中叶为界，分为前后两期。前一期的农民起义主要表现反徭役、并争取人身权方面，因而其口号所包含的思想主要是一种狂暴式的“财产共有”或“共同劳动”的教义；后一期的农民起义主要表现在分产均产方面，因而其口号所包含的思想是一种更现实的财产平均的教义。并且，有的同志认为，前后期农民起义在纲领口号上之所以不同，是因为唐中叶以前是国家土地所有制占统治地位，唐中叶以后是地主土地私有制占统治地位。
    主张以唐中叶为界把农民战争分为前后两期的同志中，有的还把前期和后期各分为两段。前期分为秦至两汉、三国至唐中叶两段：前段的主要内容是争取生存权、反对兼并，后段是反奴役、反人身依附关系；后期分为唐至元、明至鸦片战争两段：前段的主要内容是要求财产平均、人身平等，后段是反对封建土地所有制和赋税。
    主张三段分法的有两种意见。一种意见是根据农民起义的政治要求，结合封建社会的发展阶段进行考察。这种意见认为，唐以前的农民起义为低级阶段。农民的政治要求主要是争取生存权利的斗争，这是和中国封建社会发展的早期阶段相一致的。随着中国封建社会向着全盛的阶段发展，农民的阶级斗争也是由低级阶段发展到较高阶段，这便是唐、宋两代的农民起义。在这一阶段，农民第一次在中国历史上提出了平均财产的口号，这就远远超过了前代农民起义所提出的要求。随着中国封建社会走上缓慢的解体过程，农民的阶级斗争也发展到一个更高级的阶段，这便是明代后期的农民起义。这时，农民全面冲击封建制度的各个方面，其表现是：反对封建土地所有制；反对封建的分配关系，进行减租和抗租的斗争；反对封建的人身奴役关系，要求人身解放。另一种意见认为，可以农民战争所反对的内容作为划分阶段的标准，分为这样三段：东汉末年以前的农民战争，主要特点是反封建依附化和反奴隶残余。三国到唐末的农民战争，主要特点是打击封建大土地所有制和豪族门阀的统治。宋以后的农民战争，反对封建土地所有制和专制统治的斗争更加激烈和高涨，其中还夹杂着反对落后经济关系的斗争。
    主张四段分法的同志，是按照中国封建社会的分期来划分农民革命战争的发展阶段。他们认为，封建社会各时期的主要矛盾，决定了各时期农民革命战争的特点。因此，他们把农民战争分为四个时期：（一）封建社会的早期（战国到东汉末黄巾起义），主要矛盾为农民与豪强大族地主阶级之间的矛盾，农民起义的主要目的是反奴役、反饥饿和争生存，农民起义的特点是有较浓厚的原始性。（二）封建社会的成长期（三国到唐末黄巢起义），主要矛盾是世族地主与农民之间的矛盾，农民战争的主要要求是反对门阀世族地主的压迫，争取人身权利。（三）在封建社会的发展期（宋到元末红巾军起义），租佃关系已很普遍，经济依附加强了，国家的赋役等剥削也很沉重，因此，这一时期农民战争便主要是反对封建租佃关系，反对残酷剥削，提出了“等贵贱、均贫富”等口号。（四）封建社会的晚期（明到清），农民起义的口号纲领比以前更明确，农民起义的主要要求是反对土地高度集中，为争取土地而斗争。
    中国农民革命战争中的农民政权问题
    我国封建社会的农民，在革命战争中，常常建立起一定的政治组织，以反抗封建统治。这是中国封建社会农民革命战争的一个显著特点，必须正确地加以阐明。目前史学界对这个问题的讨论，主要集中在两个问题上：在封建社会中，农民能不能建立自己的政权？在我国封建社会中，农民在革命战争中建立的政治组织是什么性质？
    一种意见认为，在封建制度下，农民不能建立自己的政权。他们主要的理由是：一、政治是经济的集中表现，作为上层建筑的政权是由经济基础决定的。在封建时代，因为农民是不断分化的小私有者和小生产者阶级，所以农民政权是不可能出现的。二、农民的斗争是自发的活动，只能局限于封建经济制度的范围内，局限于维护和发展自己的小私有制、小经济，他们无法理解封建的上层建筑，因而没有改变国家制度的要求，不会也不可能建立政权。
    持有这种意见的同志认为，我国封建社会的农民在革命战争中建立的政治组织不是“政权”，而只是临时为军事服务的军事机构，是一种斗争形式。有的认为这种政治组织可以称为短期性政权，但不能称为“农民政权”，因为这些短期性的政权，不可能变广大农民为统治阶级。在农民的心目中和在事实上，存在的只能是“好皇帝”。这就是说，“新政权”与“旧政权”之间只存在着差别，而没有实质上的不同。
    和上述意见相反，不少同志认为，封建社会中的农民能够建立政权。他们认为，政权就是一定阶级的统治权。凡是有政治机构、有政治设施、有政治纲领的组织，都应称为政权。他们也指出，由于农民是小生产者阶级，农民所建立的政权只能是短期性的。但是，不应该把这一点同农民能不能建立新的社会制度，能不能建立一种作为新社会制度最高暴力机构的政权混为一谈。他们还认为，农民战争是阶级斗争最高形式，因此，农民的斗争决不限于经济斗争，也要求推翻地主阶级的统治，改变自己的政治地位，建立自己的政权。
    持有这种意见的同志认为，我国封建社会农民在革命战争中建立的政治组织，是短期性的农民政权。他们也认为，由于历史条件的限制，农民自身没有明确的方向，所以农民政权只能在武装斗争的过程中存在，并常常是军政合一的。这些同志并强调指出，农民政权虽然是仿照地主阶级中央或地方政权机关的组织形式建立起来的，但是它和地主阶级的政权在实质上是不同的，即它领导农民反对封建王朝，对地主阶级施行政治压迫，实施一些符合农民利益的经济政策，采取原始性的素朴民主的“公议”形式，等等。
    讨论涉及的问题很多。此外，还有农民战争和宗教的关系，农民的阶级斗争和民族斗争的关系，等等。但是，从上述介绍中已可看出，近年来我国历史学界对中国封建社会农民革命战争史的研究已大大加强，并已取得一定成绩。为了使讨论开展得更加深入，更加广泛，我们想提出以下几点意见。首先，需要对一些重要的急待解决的问题，展开深入的研究和讨论，集中地加以解决。如中国农民战争的历史作用，就是值得集中讨论的问题之一。其次，需要深入地研究一些较大的农民革命战争，如黄巾起义、黄巢起义等。
    加强学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，对中国农民革命战争史的研究具有特别重要的意义。我们要认真体会毛泽东思想的精神实质，学会像毛泽东同志那样去研究农民问题，对历史事实进行创造性的分析和综合，从其中引出规律，建立中国农民革命战争史这门学科。
    在研究中国农民革命战争史的时候，必须加强反对国内外反动历史学的斗争。解放前，国内外的反动历史学者，一直在恶毒地污蔑我国农民革命斗争历史，为其反动的政治目的服务。解放以后，在我国露骨地宣扬这些反动历史观点的是没有了，然而这些观点的影响在某些著作中仍然在一定程度上存在，如丑化农民阶级，美化地主阶级，模糊阶级斗争，把农民革命战争描绘得十分残酷、恐怖，散播感伤主义的情调，抹杀农民革命战争的伟大历史作用，等等。显然，只有同这些反动的观点进行坚决的斗争，只有肃清这些观点的影响，才能真正阐明农民革命斗争历史，提高研究水平。
    在研究和讨论中，需要认真地贯彻“百家争鸣”方针。各个重大问题，都要展开反复地争辩。对有关史实，要集中人力分头加以整理；对经典著作有关的指示，要集中起来进行学习和讨论。不同的意见，只要是持之有故，言之成理，都要允许发表，不要急于得出结论。有关的刊物，需要积极地组织和推动这方面的研究工作。我们相信，只要坚持毛泽东思想，同心协力去作，中国农民革命战争史的研究一定会获得更加显著的成就。
