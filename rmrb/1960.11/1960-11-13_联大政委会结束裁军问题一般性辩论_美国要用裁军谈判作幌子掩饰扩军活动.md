Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 10th: The general discussion on disarmament at the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee concluded on the 8th.

The Political Committee's debate on disarmament, which began on October 19th and lasted for three weeks, once again proved that the aggressive and bellicose United States and other imperialist countries have no intention of disarming and continue to do everything possible to obstruct the reaching of a disarmament agreement.

The United States representative, Wadsworth, emphasized in the discussion that the disarmament issue is a "difficult problem" that "cannot be achieved by passing resolutions or reaching agreement on wording that conceals fundamental disputes." He made it clear that the United States intends to continue using negotiations as a guise to cover up the stepped-up arms expansion and war preparations by the United States.

The British representative, Ormsby-Gore, put forward a proposal at the meeting advocating that the establishment of a committee of experts to study supervision and inspection issues is an "urgent measure in disarmament negotiations." In reality, this is to return the disarmament issue to the old path of endless negotiations that yield no results.

This position of the Western countries was condemned by representatives of socialist countries and some other countries at the meeting.

The Guinean representative, Ismail Touré, said at the October 31st meeting that disarmament is unimaginable without eliminating imperialism and colonialism.

The Cuban representative, Bisti, emphasized at the meeting on the 1st that the United States and other imperialist countries do not genuinely want disarmament because they are pursuing a policy of intimidation and aggression. He said that the false masks of disarmament advocates on their faces should be torn off, and the people should know this.

Over the past three weeks, sixty-four representatives have spoken at the meeting and put forward eight proposals successively. At this point, the meeting of the UN General Assembly's Political Committee on disarmament issues adjourned indefinitely, pending the drafting of draft resolutions by the representatives of various countries.

    联大政委会结束裁军问题一般性辩论
    美国要用裁军谈判作幌子掩饰扩军活动
    据新华社10日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会关于裁军问题的一般性讨论已经在8日结束。
    政治委员会关于裁军问题的辩论，是在10月19日开始的，历时三周的辩论再一次证明，侵略和好战成性的美国和其他帝国主义国家，根本不想裁军，它们继续千方百计地阻碍达成裁军的协议。
    美国代表华兹沃斯在讨论中强调，裁军问题是一个“难题”，“不能靠通过决议或在掩饰基本争端的措词上取得协议来加以实现”。他表明美国企图继续利用谈判作为掩饰美国加紧扩军备战的幌子。
    英国代表奥姆斯比—戈尔在会上提出了一个提案，这个提案里鼓吹，建立专家委员会来研究监督和视察问题，是“裁军谈判中的迫切措施”。实际上，这是要使裁军问题回复到得不到任何结果的无休止的谈判的老路。
    西方国家的这种立场在会上受到社会主义国家和其他一些国家的代表的谴责。
    几内亚代表伊斯梅尔·杜尔在10月31日会议上说，不清除帝国主义和殖民主义就无法想像裁军。
    古巴代表比斯维1日在会上强调指出，美国和其他帝国主义国家并不真正希望裁军，因为它执行的政策是恫吓和侵略的政策。他说，应当撕下它们脸上的裁军拥护者的假面具，应当让人民知道这一点。
    三周以来，六十四个代表在会上发了言，先后提出了八个提案。至此，联大政治委员会关于裁军问题的会议无限期休会，以待各国代表起草决议草案。
