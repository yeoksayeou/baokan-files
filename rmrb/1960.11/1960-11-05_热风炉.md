Small Information

    A hot air furnace is designed based on the principle of natural convection, where air rises when heated and descends when cooled. As everyone knows, many large modern factories and enterprises use hot air for heating. Compared with modern equipment, the hot air furnace is simply simpler in structure.

    The advantages of a hot air furnace are: simple equipment, easy to manufacture, saves raw materials, materials, and fuel. According to experiments, using a hot air furnace to replace a boiler for heating can save at least 20% to 30% of coal, or even more. Hot air furnace heating has a wide range of applications, suitable for residential houses, as well as offices, organizations, troops, schools, enterprises, and people's commune offices, canteens, and club dormitories; suitable for heating, cooking, and kang (heated brick bed) heating in people's lives, and also suitable for industrial and agricultural production. For example, poultry incubation, greenhouse planting, tobacco curing, grain drying, and drying and processing of products such as brick blanks and plywood can all utilize hot air furnaces.

    热风炉
    热风炉是根据空气受热上升，受冷下降的自然对流原理设计的。大家都知道，一些大的现代化工厂企业，不少都是采用热风取暖的。热风炉与现代化设备比较起来，只不过在构造上比较简单一些罢了。
    热风炉的优点是：设备简单，容易制作，省原料、材料、燃料。根据试验，用热风炉代替锅炉取暖，至少可以省煤百分之二十到百分之三十，甚至还多。热风炉取暖适用范围很广，既适用于居民住宅，也适用于机关、团体、部队、学校、企业和人民公社的办公室、食堂以及俱乐部宿舍等；既适用于人民生活中的取暖、做饭、烧炕，也适用于工农业生产。如孵化家禽、温室种植、烤烟、烘粮以及砖坯、胶合板等产品干燥加工，都可利用热风炉。
