Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Sydney: The Chinese Trade Union Delegation, headed by Liu Changsheng, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, who visited Australia at the invitation of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, left Sydney yesterday with the friendship of the Australian people. The leaders of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and many leaders and members of trade union units warmly saw off the representatives of the Chinese working class.

On the evening of November 4, the Chinese Trade Union Delegation held a farewell banquet at the Sydney Trade Union Hall, attended by representatives of about fifty-seven trade union organizations and other groups.

Liu Changsheng, head of the Chinese Trade Union Delegation, said at the banquet that this visit had "built a great bridge of friendship" between the people of the two countries. He said that the working class should strengthen its strength and unity in the struggle to defend world peace. He said, "In this regard, the most effective way is for trade unions of different countries to engage in friendly exchanges, mutual respect and understanding."

James Kenny, Vice-Chairman of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said that this visit showed how much this kind of friendship is needed in these days when the Cold War is prevalent. He said: "The working class has a huge responsibility to prevent the Cold War from turning into a hot war."

After arriving in Sydney on October 10, the Chinese Trade Union Delegation successively visited the capitals of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, as well as some industrial centers in these states. The delegation was warmly welcomed by Australian trade union leaders and the vast number of trade union members, and warmly received by the local people everywhere. Although a small handful of reactionaries attempted to sabotage this friendly visit by the Chinese Trade Union Delegation and sow discord between trade unions and trade union members in Australia and socialist countries, their conspiracy has been shamefully defeated.

    我工会代表团离开悉尼
    澳工会领导人和会员热情送行
    新华社7日讯　悉尼消息：应澳大利亚工会理事会的邀请前往澳大利亚进行友好访问的以中华全国总工会副主席刘长胜为首的中国工会代表团，昨天带着澳大利亚人民的友谊离开悉尼。澳大利亚工会理事会的负责人以及许多工会单位的领导人和会员热情地为中国工人阶级的代表送行。
    在11月4日晚上，中国工会代表团在悉尼工会大厅举行了告别宴会，大约有五十七个工会组织的代表和其它团体的代表出席。
    中国工会代表团团长刘长胜在宴会上说，这次访问已经在两国人民之间“建造了一座伟大的友谊桥梁”。他说，工人阶级应当在保卫世界和平的斗争中加强自己的力量和团结。他说，“在这方面，最有效的办法是不同国家的工会进行友好往来，相互尊重和了解。”
    澳大利亚工会理事会副主席詹姆斯·肯尼说，这次访问表明，处在冷战盛行的日子里是多么需要这种友谊。他说：“为了要防止冷战变成热战，工人阶级负有巨大的责任。”
    中国工会代表团在10月10日到达悉尼后，曾先后访问了新南威尔士、维多利亚、昆士兰和南澳大利亚等州的首府和这些州的一些工业中心。代表团到处都受到了澳大利亚工会领袖和广大工会会员的热烈欢迎和当地人民的热情接待。虽然有一小撮反动分子企图破坏中国工会代表团的这次友好访问，并在澳大利亚和社会主义国家的工会和工会会员之间进行挑拨离间，但是，他们的阴谋已经遭到了可耻的失败。
