    Through Discussion Among Commune Members, Correctly Implement Distribution Policies
    Sun Shaoyan Promotes Democratic Work Style, Inspires Mass Enthusiasm and Improves Production
    (Our dispatch) Sun Shaoyan, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Liangjiashan People's Commune in Shulan County, Jilin Province, and Secretary of the Party General Branch of the Donggu Management District, conscientiously studies the Party's policies and principles, meticulously acts in accordance with the Party's policies and principles in his work, and fully mobilizes the production enthusiasm of the broad masses, promoting continuous leaps forward in production.
    Sun Shaoyan, who came from a hired peasant background, has deeply experienced since joining the workforce that to do a good job, it is necessary to correctly implement the Party's policies and principles. To correctly implement the Party's policies and principles, one must first understand the spirit and essence of the Party's policies and principles. Therefore, he diligently studies the documents of the higher-level Party committees, carefully studies the basis for the formulation of the Party's various policies and principles, and promptly seeks instructions from the higher-level Party committees when he does not understand something. He has a correct understanding of many of the Party's major policies, constantly measures his work according to the Party's policies and principles, and uses it as a weapon to mobilize the masses to improve production and as a key to solving every specific problem in his work.
    Sun Shaoyan regards adhering to the principle of distribution according to labor as the most important link in mobilizing the masses to improve production. He recognizes that "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" is the principle of socialism, so in leading production, he always pays attention to its implementation. After the autumn harvest began this year, he gained an in-depth understanding of the progress of the first production team's autumn harvest and discovered problems in the evaluation of work and recording of work points. That evening, he helped the captain convene a meeting of commune members, changed the method of evaluating work and recording work points, determined to give rewards for exceeding quotas, and appropriately adjusted the work points of commune members who had harvested well in the previous days after democratic evaluation. Labor efficiency increased significantly the next day. This incident greatly enlightened the team cadres. Team cadre Sun Zhenhe said, "In the past, I thought that with so much work, how could there be time to evaluate work and record work points! Now I understand that evaluating work and recording work points according to the Party's policies makes the masses more enthusiastic." In the spring of this year, the plan to plant thirty hectares of paddy fields in Donggu Village was only two hectares short of completion. Sun Shaoyan, together with Yan Fenglou, the deputy director of the management district, and Yao Wenfu, the production team leader at the time, studied the situation, clarified the reasons, mainly that paddy fields were labor-intensive, the contracted targets were too low, and there were difficulties in completing the task due to insufficient manpower and animal power. Based on this situation, after discussion among commune members, the "three guarantees" targets were adjusted, and help was provided to solve the problem of insufficient manpower and animal power. In this way, the commune members were very satisfied, and they plowed the two hectares of land in two days. During the autumn harvest, these two hectares of paddy fields yielded an average of more than seven thousand catties of grain per hectare. The commune members all said, "These two hectares of rice were planted thanks to Lao Sun's grasp." Sun Shaoyan said, "It's not me, it's mainly because we all acted according to the Party's policies."

    通过社员讨论正确执行分配政策
    孙绍岩发扬民主作风鼓舞群众干劲搞好生产
    本报讯　吉林省舒兰县亮甲山人民公社党委副书记兼东孤管理区党总支书记孙绍岩，踏踏实实地钻研党的方针政策，在工作中一丝不苟地按照党的方针政策办事，充分调动起广大群众的生产积极性，促进生产不断跃进。
    孙绍岩是雇工出身，参加工作以来，他深深地体验到，要想做好工作，必须正确地贯彻执行党的方针政策。而要正确地贯彻执行党的方针政策，首先必须自己懂得党的方针政策的精神实质。因此，他努力学习上级党委的文件，仔细地研究党的各项方针政策制定的根据，有不懂的地方，就及时请示上级党委。他对党的许多重大政策都有正确的理解，时时刻刻按照党的方针政策衡量自己的工作，把它作为发动群众搞好生产的武器，解决工作中每一个具体问题的钥匙。
    孙绍岩把坚持实行按劳分配的原则作为发动群众搞好生产的最重要一环。他认识到，“各尽所能，按劳分配”是社会主义的原则，所以在领导生产中，随时注意贯彻执行。今年秋收开始以后，他深入了解第一生产队的秋收进度，发现评工记分方面有毛病。当天晚上，他帮助队长召开了社员大会，改变了评工记分方法，确定超额给以奖励，并且对前几天割得好的社员，经过民主评议，适当地调整了工分。第二天劳动效率就提高很多。这件事，给队干部很大启示。队干部孙振和说：“过去我寻思活这么多，哪有时间评工记分！这回明白了，按着党的政策评工记分，群众越有干劲。”今年春天，东孤屯种三十公顷水田的计划，只差两公顷没有完成。孙绍岩同管理区副主任阎凤楼和当时的生产队长姚文福一起研究，弄清了原因，主要是水田费工，包工指标偏低，加上人力和畜力不足，完成任务有困难。根据这个情况，经过社员讨论，调整了“三包”指标，并且帮助解决了人力畜力不足的问题。这样，社员们都很满意，两天就把两公顷地翻过来了。秋收时，这两公顷水田每公顷平均打了七千多斤粮食。社员们都说：“这两公顷稻子，多亏老孙掌握着种上了。”孙绍岩说：“不是我，主要是咱们大家按照党的政策办了。”（附图片）
