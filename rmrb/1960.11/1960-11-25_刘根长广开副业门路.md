The commune members in our commune always mention Liu Gengchang, the director of the commune's central store, when they talk about this year's sideline production. Why do the members associate him with sideline production? It turns out that he has contributed greatly to the development of winter sideline production in the commune's production teams, taking the lead in everything from planning funds and collecting raw materials to exchanging technical experience. For example, the Xiaozhang and Da’anyuan production teams have the technique of weaving brooms, but they cannot produce them regularly because of insufficient raw materials. Liu Gengchang helped the production team mobilize members to go up the mountains to cut willow branches. Although the Juli production team has a lot of red vitex, the members are not in the habit of weaving it. After Liu Gengchang discovered this situation, he discussed it with the Party branch secretary and the production team leader, and helped them bring in a basket weaving master from another place, who taught twenty-six members. By early November, more than four hundred back baskets, carrying baskets, earth baskets, etc. had been woven. The members happily said: "If Director Liu hadn't come to guide us, this year's red vitex would have been burned as firewood again."

    刘根长广开副业门路
    我们公社的社员们一谈论起今年的副业生产的时候，总要提到公社中心商店的主任刘根长。为什么社员提到副业生产就联想起他呢？原来他为公社各生产队开展冬季副业生产出力很大，不论筹划资金、搜集原料和交流技术经验，事事都走在前头。如小章和大安院两个生产队有编笤篱技术，因为原料不足，不能经常生产。刘根长帮助生产队发动社员上山割柳条。菊里生产队虽然长有很多红荆，但是，社员没有编荆的习惯。刘根长发现这一情况以后，就同党支部书记和生产队长研究，并帮助他们从外地请来个编筐师傅，教会了二十六个社员。到11月上旬，已经编出背筐、抬筐、土篮等四百多个。社员们高兴地说：“要不是刘主任来指导，今年的红荆又要当柴烧了。” 	 河北深县武强公社　志学等四人
