Learning While Doing

To truly understand the Party's policies, cadres must both study diligently and personally put them into practice. Practice is key. Through practice, the understanding of policies becomes more profound.

The Party formulates policies based on scientific foundations. These foundations are not fully understood simply by looking at the words on the surface, which requires careful and meticulous study. When studying, one must think seriously. Without arduous thinking, it is impossible to grasp the spirit and essence of the Party's policies, let alone transform them into one's own and use them to guide work.

Learning must be connected with doing. Reading is learning, and doing is also learning, and even more important learning. Because policies originate from practice and must guide practice. The process of practice is the process of implementing policies. Grassroots cadres have rich experience in implementing the Party's policies. This experience needs to be summarized in a timely manner, good aspects immediately absorbed, and shortcomings promptly corrected. Through doing, one can deeply understand the spirit and essence of the Party's policies, further understand why the Party stipulates this policy or that policy, and distinguish policy boundaries. Through doing, one can also understand the masses' attitude towards the Party's policies, how the masses implement the policies, and the effect of implementing the policies, thereby deepening the concept of policy.

Learning and doing cannot be completely separated. Learning is for doing; only by doing it personally can the effect of learning be tested. When learning, it is necessary to connect with practical experience; when doing, it is necessary to use what has been learned as guidance. Learning and doing, doing and learning, repeating this process, the understanding of the Party's policies will go from not understanding to understanding, from understanding little to understanding more, from understanding superficially to understanding deeply. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To turn not understanding into understanding, you have to go and do it, go and see it, this is learning." When the Qingcheng People's Commune organized team cadres to study the Party's policies, it adopted the method of learning while doing, which is in line with the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction. We should all learn this method to more effectively improve the policy level of cadres and promote continuous leaps in production.

    边学边做
    干部要真正懂得党的政策，一方面要认真地学，一方面还要亲自去做。做，就是实践。经过实践，体会政策更能深刻。
    党制订政策，都有科学的根据。这些根据，不是浮在字面上一看全懂的，这就需要认真仔细地学习。学的时候，要认真思考。没有艰苦的思考，就不可能领会党的政策的精神实质，更不能变成自己的东西，用它来指导工作。
    学要和做联系起来。读书是学习，做也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。因为政策来源于实践，而且要指导实践。实践的过程，就是贯彻执行政策的过程。基层干部是有贯彻党的政策的丰富经验的。这些经验需要及时加以总结，好的马上吸取，缺点及时纠正。通过做，就可以深切领会党的政策的精神实质，就能够进一步弄懂党为什么要规定这项政策或那项政策；并从中分清政策界限。通过做，还可以了解群众对党的政策的态度，群众怎样贯彻执行政策，以及贯彻政策的效果，从而加深政策观念。
  学和做不能截然分开。学是为了做；只有亲自去做，才能检验出学的效果。学时，要联系实践经验；做时，要用学来的东西做指导。学学做做，做做学学，如此反复下去，对党的政策才会从不懂到懂，从懂得少到懂得多，从懂得浅到懂得深。毛泽东同志说：“要使不懂得变成懂得，就要去做去看，这就是学习。”青城人民公社组织小队干部学习党的政策时，采取边学边做的办法，正合乎毛主席这一指示的精神。我们都应当学会这一方法，以便更有效地提高干部的政策水平，促进生产不断跃进。
