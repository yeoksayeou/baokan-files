Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 26th. The Exhibition of Achievements in China's Economic Construction successfully concluded this evening after being on display here for twenty-one days. During the exhibition, over 150,000 people from all walks of life in Iraq visited the exhibition, and approximately 40,000 people watched the Chinese color documentary "Celebrating Ten Years" and other Chinese films.

The grand occasion of the exhibition being warmly welcomed by the Iraqi people vividly reflects the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Iraq. Every day, thousands of people entered the exhibition, including workers, farmers, students, business people, government employees, and housewives. Many others traveled from Basra and other distant places to Baghdad specifically to visit the exhibition.

The final day of the exhibition was especially moving. Many visitors came to the exhibition again for one last visit and expressed their best wishes to the Chinese staff. They repeatedly visited the exhibits that interested them in the exhibition hall and the open-air square. Many visitors surrounded the precision machine tools being operated by Chinese workers. Railway workers rushed to the exhibition to take pictures of the "Red Flag" sedan. Some Iraqi women took pictures in the textile exhibition area. In the open-air square, groups of visitors carefully listened to explanations about improved simple agricultural tools. Many visitors brought photos they had taken at the exhibition a few days earlier and gave them to their Chinese friends as souvenirs. Some visitors invited the Chinese staff to take pictures with them, and some asked them to sign autographs.

A group of Iraqi engineers led by Hazim Wadi Abdullah, accompanied by Yang Keyi, the cultural counselor of the Chinese Embassy, also visited the exhibition. The Iraqi engineers expressed great admiration for the exhibition.

The last batch of Chinese goods sold at the exhibition's store, like in previous days, quickly sold out.

As the exhibition came to a close, the Iraqi staff and the Chinese staff warmly shook hands and embraced, and took photos and signed autographs together.

Each part of the exhibition was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Iraqi people. Workers were particularly fond of the precision machines, textile machines, automobiles, and trucks made in China; farmers were especially interested in China's people's communes and various agricultural tools. They all hailed the great strength demonstrated by China's Great Leap Forward.

Visitors expressed their deep friendship with the Chinese people and warmly praised the exhibition in the guest book. Ali Shukr, chairman of the Iraqi General Federation of Workers, wrote in the guest book: "All the exhibits impressed me and the Iraqi workers. This admiration is because China's progress serves all mankind, especially the Chinese people." An engineer named Ravi wrote: "Eleven years is not a long period in human history, but despite the short period, China has achieved achievements in this period that other countries would take hundreds of years to achieve."

An Arab wrote: "Our friends! We are watching your achievements with increasing joy. Your achievements in all aspects are also our achievements." A Kurd wrote: "Humanity is proud of its labor. This is what I have realized from the great Chinese exhibition." Someone else wrote: "The development of People's China will always inspire the working people of the world." "The achievements of People's China give the people of Asia and Africa confidence in their victory."

A student named Nasser expressed his hope that "the road of the Chinese people will become a beacon for the liberation and freedom of people all over the world from imperialist enslavement."

    中国经济建设成就展览会在巴格达胜利闭幕
    伊拉克十五万人参观展览会
    许多观众留言，热烈赞扬中国人民在建设中取得的伟大成就。他们写道：“人民中国的发展将永远鼓舞着全世界的劳动人民。”“人民中国的成就使亚非人民对自己的胜利有信心。”“中国人民的道路成为世界各地摆脱帝国主义奴役，获得解放和自由的明灯。”
    据新华社巴格达26日电　中华人民共和国经济建设成就展览会在这里展出二十一天以后，今晚胜利闭幕。在展出期间，共有十五万以上的伊拉克各界人士参观了展览会，约有四万人观看了中国彩色纪录片《欢庆十年》和其他中国电影。
    展览会受到伊拉克人民衷心欢迎的盛况生动地反映了中伊两国人民的深情厚谊。每一天，都有数以千计的人走进展览会，其中有工人、农民、学生、企业界人士、政府职员和家庭妇女，另外还有许多是特地从巴士拉和其他远地赶到巴格达参观的。
    展览会的最后一天，更出现了十分令人感动的场面。许多参观者又一次来到展览会作最后一次参观，并且向展览会的中国工作人员表示最好的祝愿。他们一次又一次地在展览馆和露天广场参观了他们感到兴趣的展品。许多参观者围着中国工人在操作的精密机床。铁路工人们匆匆赶到展览会来拍摄“红旗牌”轿车的照片。一些伊拉克妇女在纺织品展览部拍摄照片。在露天广场上，成群的参观者仔细地倾听着关于改良简易农具的讲解。许多参观者还带来他们几天前在展览馆拍摄的照片，送给中国朋友留念。一些参观者邀请中国工作人员同他们一起照相，有些参观者要求他们签名留念。
    由哈齐姆·瓦迪·阿卜杜拉率领的一批伊拉克工程师在中国大使馆文化参赞杨克毅陪同下也参观了展览会。伊拉克工程师们对展览会表示非常钦佩。
    在展览会小卖处出售的最后一批中国商品同前几天一样，很快就销售一空。
    在展览会临结束时，展览会的伊拉克工作人员和中国工作人员热情地握手和拥抱，并且一起照了相，签名留念。
    展览会的各部分都受到伊拉克广大群众的热烈欢迎。工人们对中国制造的精密机器、纺织机器、汽车和卡车特别喜爱；农民们对中国的人民公社和各种农具尤其感到兴趣。他们都欢呼中国大跃进所显示出来的伟大力量。
    观众们纷纷在留言簿上表示他们对中国人民的深厚友谊并热烈赞扬展览会。伊拉克工人总联合会主席阿里·舒克尔在留言簿上写道：“所有的展品使我和伊拉克工人感到钦佩。这种钦佩是由于，中国的进步是为全体人类，特别是为中国人民服务的。”一位名叫拉维的工程师写道：“十一年在人类历史上不算一个长时期，但是，尽管时期不长，中国在这个时期内取得了其他国家要几百年才能取得的成就。”
    有一位阿拉伯人写道：“我们的朋友！我们正在以日益欢欣的心情注视着你们的成就。你们在各方面的成就也就是我们的成就。”一位库尔德人写道：“人类对自己的劳动感到骄傲。这就是我从伟大的中国展览会中认识到的。”也有人写道：“人民中国的发展将永远鼓舞着全世界的劳动人民”。“人民中国的成就使亚非人民对自己的胜利有信心”。
    一个名叫纳赛尔的学生表示希望，“中国人民的道路成为世界各地摆脱帝国主义奴役，获得解放和自由的明灯。”
