    The Charger Passed Down Through Generations

    This old-fashioned charger has been used in the revolutionary ranks for nearly thirty years.

    In 1931, the Red First Front Army's radio station began using this charger. The radio station personnel and transportation personnel took great care of it, carrying it back and forth during several frequent battles against the "encirclement and suppression." When it rained, they put raincoats on the machine first. In the mud, fearing the mules and horses would slip, the soldiers carried it themselves. During air raids, the machine was the first to enter the air-raid shelter. When breaking through, they could abandon all their belongings, but the charger had to be safely evacuated. During the unprecedented 25,000-li Long March, the soldiers carried it across snow-capped mountains 5,000 meters above sea level and across the turbulent Dadu River. Enduring hunger, under extremely difficult conditions, the red heroes carried it across the uninhabited grasslands. Along the way, many comrades who carried it heroically sacrificed themselves, but the machine remained intact and was used in northern Shaanxi. Until the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, it continued to charge and illuminate our army's radio stations.

    This revolutionary charger, passed down through generations, is covered with the dust of the march on its machine body, blackened by the smoke of war, as if telling people the feats of those selfless red heroes who cherished equipment.　　　(Xiaobai) (Attached picture)

    世代相传的充电机
    这台老式的充电机，在革命队伍里使用了近三十个年头。
    1931年，红一方面军电台开始使用这部充电机，电台人员和运输人员对它爱护备至，在几次反“围剿”的频繁战斗中，抬来抬去。下雨时先给机器穿上雨衣，泥泞中怕骡马滑倒，战士们自己抬着它走，防空时机器先入防空洞，突围时可以丢掉自己的一切行装，可是充电机一定得安全撤走。在史无前例的两万五千里长征中，战士们带着它越过了终年积雪的海拔五千米的高山，跨过了波涛汹涌的大渡河。红色英雄们忍着饥饿，在极端困难的情况下，带着它爬过了荒无人烟的水草地。一路上许多抬它的同志光荣牺牲了，但机器仍然完整无损用到陕北，直到抗日战争、解放战争，它仍然为我军电台充电放光。
    这个世代相传的革命充电机，在那被战争硝烟熏黑了的机身上沾满着行军路上的尘土，好像是在向人们述说着那些舍己为公，爱护器材的红色英雄们的功勋。　　　（晓白）（附图片）
