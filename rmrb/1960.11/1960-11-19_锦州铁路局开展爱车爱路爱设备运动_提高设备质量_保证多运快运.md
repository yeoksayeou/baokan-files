Jinzhou Railway Bureau Launches "Love the Train, Love the Track, Love the Equipment" Campaign
Improve Equipment Quality, Ensure More and Faster Transportation

(Our dispatch) The Jinzhou Railway Bureau, while vigorously promoting production, has also been focusing on equipment maintenance. Since March, it has launched a mass movement to "love the train, love the track, love the equipment" to improve the quality of equipment. This movement has gone through three stages: a major equipment inspection and overhaul, a major upgrade in quality, and the establishment of sound systems and strengthened management, which has greatly improved the quality of various types of equipment. The number of locomotives, lines, communication signal equipment, and machine tools with excellent quality has greatly increased, and the quality of boilers, high platforms and low cargo berths, and various tools has also been greatly improved. Due to the improvement in equipment quality, locomotive temporary repairs from April to October this year decreased by 40% compared to the same period last year, ensuring safe operation and ensuring more and faster transportation.

In the early stages of the "Love the Train, Love the Track, Love the Equipment" campaign, the Jinzhou Railway Bureau's Party Committee extensively and deeply publicized the important significance of improving equipment quality to ensuring safe production and continuous leap forward. It mobilized the masses to express their views, tell the facts, and engage in extensive discussions to correct the one-sided thinking of a few cadres who only focused on transportation efficiency and ignored equipment quality. On the basis of the safety inspection campaign, the bureau's employees conducted a comprehensive inspection and overhaul of lines, locomotives, machine tools, and boilers in accordance with the spirit of "grasping early and small, striving for initiative." The Dahu Mountain Engineering Section, relying on the leadership of the local Party Committee, organized more than 5,000 people, including commune members, garrison officers and soldiers, students, and employees' families, to eliminate many line defects. The staff of the locomotive department launched a competition of locomotive disassembly, inspection, consultation, "bathing," and treatment to improve the quality of locomotives.

After a comprehensive inspection and overhaul of railway transportation equipment, a few cadres developed a "good enough" mentality. The Party Committee promptly proposed launching a competition for major upgrades in equipment quality. Various departments of the bureau formulated equipment upgrade standards and conducted a major review of various equipment according to the new standards, carrying out careful inspection and repair. To achieve a universal upgrade in equipment quality, they adopted the following methods:

(1) Line Inspection on Foot. From the bureau to the section, led by leading cadres from the Party Committee, administration, and trade union, with the participation of technical personnel, 43 groups were formed to conduct inspections on foot of all lines, bridges, culverts, communication signals, and other equipment throughout the bureau, together with workers in the work area. The cadres who went down personally inspected everything, listened to the opinions of the masses, and worked with veteran workers and technical personnel to inspect and repair, and solve specific problems. Many cadres crossed rivers and streams, drilled into culverts, climbed slopes, and carefully inspected section by section, place by place. The Party Branch Secretary and Section Chief of the Dahu Mountain Engineering Section went to inspect sections where water damage frequently occurred. When the masses reflected that this section of the line was "repaired by day and changed by night, repaired by night and changed by day," they worked barefoot with the workers to eradicate the line defects until the line was "unchanged day and night" before leaving. During the on-foot inspection, the cadres not only grasped equipment quality but also paid attention to the employees' thinking and cared about their lives. Now, the bureau has established on-foot inspection as a system, stipulating that the engineering and electrical departments conduct it once a month.

(2) Locomotive by Locomotive Dissection. From late August to late September, the Shanhaiguan Locomotive Depot dissected and inspected 43 locomotives, discovered more than 1,400 defects, and promptly repaired them, making the quality of each locomotive reach the excellent level. On the basis of the bureau-wide locomotive dissection and treatment, a professional inspection team was organized to go down and work with local employees to re-examine the best locomotives. After discovering defects, they educated the masses to improve equipment quality more conscientiously. In order to make the quality of their locomotives and machine tools reach a higher standard, the employees registered and repaired them one by one, and accepted them item by item, ensuring that nothing was missed and nothing was left behind.

(3) Tackle Key Issues and Investigate Hidden Dangers. Through continuous inspection, repeated repairs, and repeated sorting, old key problems that had not been solved for a long time became more and more prominent; after careful inspection and repair, hidden dangers that were not easily discovered in the past were also found. They then adopted the method of "three combinations" (leadership, technicians, and workers), classified and sorted, grasped the key, concentrated superior forces, and broke through them one by one. The bureau formed 533 key-tackling commando teams, which have successively solved 118 key problems. The employees also found ways to eliminate many hidden dangers, further improving equipment quality.

(4) Launch a Large-Scale Equipment Quality Upgrade Competition. For example, the locomotive department launched an excellent red flag locomotive competition, the engineering department launched a red flag line competition, and the vehicle department launched a "repair 100 pieces a day" competition, etc. With the deepening of the competition, the concept of employees caring for equipment and loving equipment has been further strengthened. Many locomotive crew members consciously adhere to the "five no-go's," that is, do not leave without thoroughly inspecting the locomotive, do not leave without cleaning it, do not leave without repairing it, do not leave without preparing for the next shift, and do not leave without explaining everything clearly. At present, the bureau has produced 14 model workshops, 183 groups, and 868 individuals who love trains, love tracks, and love equipment. Everywhere there is a surge of enthusiasm for everyone to love equipment and everyone to learn from the advanced.

In order to consolidate the results of the movement, on the basis of a comprehensive upgrade in equipment quality, the bureau launched a mass upsurge of formulating measures and conventions, and better combined the mass movement with strengthening enterprise management. Good experiences and good methods were incorporated into the system and jointly mastered by leaders and the masses. The locomotive department universally improved the "three guarantees system" of contracting for driving, contracting for repair, and contracting for the team, assigning cars, assigning groups, and assigning people, clarifying the division of labor, and being responsible to the end. Factories established and improved the "three specializations" system of inspection and flaw detection (special person, special number, special type), etc. This better ensured the continuous improvement of equipment quality.

    锦州铁路局开展爱车爱路爱设备运动
    提高设备质量　保证多运快运
    本报讯　锦州铁路局在大抓生产的同时，狠抓设备检修，从3月份以来开展了群众性的爱车、爱路、爱设备的提高设备质量的运动。这个运动经历了设备大检查大整修、质量大升级和健全制度加强管理三个阶段，大大提高了各种设备的质量。全局质量优良的机车、线路、通讯信号设备、机床的数量大大增加，锅炉、高站台低货位以及各种机具等设备的质量也有很大提高。由于设备质量提高，今年4至10月与去年同时期比较，机车临时修理减少了40％，保证了安全运行，保证了多运快运。
    锦州铁路局党委在爱车、爱路、爱设备运动的初期，曾经广泛深入地宣传了提高设备质量对保证安全生产、保证持续跃进的重要意义，发动群众摆观点，讲事实，大讨论，纠正了少数干部只抓运输效率不顾设备质量的片面思想。全局职工在安全大检查运动的基础上，根据“抓早抓小，争取主动”的精神，对线路、机车、机床和锅炉等设备，进行了全面的大检查、大整修。大虎山工务段依靠当地党委的领导，组织公社社员、驻军官兵、学生以及职工家属等五千多人，消灭了许多线路病害。机务部门的职工开展了机车大解体、大检查、大会诊、大“洗澡”、大治疗的竞赛，提高了机车质量。
    在对铁路运输设备进行全面大检查、大整修以后，少数干部产生了“差不多”的思想。党委又及时提出开展设备质量大升级的竞赛。全局各个部门制订了设备升级标准，按新标准对各种设备进行大复查，细检细修。为实现设备质量普遍升级，他们采取了以下几个办法。
      （一）线路徒步大检查。从局到段，以党委、行政、工会的领导干部为主，吸收技术人员参加，成立了四十三个小组，深入到工区和工人一道，对全局所有线路、桥涵、通讯信号等设备徒步进行检查。下去的干部处处亲自去看，亲自听取群众反映，亲自同老工人、技术人员一起边检边修，解决具体问题。不少干部遇河趟水，逢涵钻洞，有坡爬坡，一段一段、一处一处地仔细检查。大虎山工务段党总支书记、段长到经常发生水害的地段去检查。群众反映这段线路是“日修夜变，夜修日变”，他们就光着脚同工人一起根治线路病害，直到线路
  “昼夜不变”才离开。在徒步检查中，干部们不仅抓设备质量，还注意职工思想，关心职工生活。现在，这个局已经把徒步检查订成制度，规定工务、电务部门每月进行一次。
      （二）机车台台大解剖。山海关机务段8月下旬到9月下旬，解剖检查了四十三台机车，发现了一千四百多件不良处所，及时整修，使台台机车质量达到优等。在全局机车大解剖、大治疗的基础上，又组织专业检查组，下去和当地职工一起，挑最好的机车进行大复查。发现不良处所后，教育群众更认真地提高设备质量。职工们为使自己的机车、机床的质量达到更高标准，都一件一件地登记整修，一笔一笔地对票验收，做到一件不漏，一处不留。
    （三）攻关键，查隐患。通过不断检查，反复整修，反复排队，长时期没有解决的老关键问题越来越突出；经过细检细修，也发现了过去常年不易发现的隐患。他们便采取“三结合”的办法，分类排队，抓住关键，集中优势力量，各个击破。全局组成了五百三十三个攻关键突击队，已先后解决关键问题一百一十八项，职工们还设法消除了许多隐患，使设备质量又进一步提高。
      （四）开展设备质量升级大竞赛。如机务部门开展优等红旗机车竞赛，工务部门开展红旗线路竞赛，车辆部门开展“日修百件”竞赛等。随着竞赛的深入开展，职工群众关心设备、爱护设备的观念进一步加强。许多机车乘务员自觉地作到“五不走”，即机车不检查彻底不走，不擦干净不走，不修完不走，不给下班准备好不走，不交代清楚不走。目前，全局已经涌现出爱车、爱路、爱设备的标兵车间有十四个，小组一百八十三个，个人八百六十八名。到处出现了人人爱设备，人人学先进的热潮。
    为了巩固运动成果，这个局在设备质量全面升级的基础上，掀起了群众性的订措施、订公约的热潮，把群众运动和加强企业管理更好地结合起来。好经验、好方法都纳入制度，由领导和群众共同掌握。机务部门普遍健全了包乘、包修、包队的“三包制”，定车、定组、定人，明确分工，负责到底。工厂建立和健全了检修探伤“三专”制（专人、专号、专型）等。这就更好地保证了设备质量不断提高。
