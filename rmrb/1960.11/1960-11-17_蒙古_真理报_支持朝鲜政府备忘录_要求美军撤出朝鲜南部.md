Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, November 16th: The Mongolian "Truth News" published an article today supporting the memorandum on the peaceful reunification of Korea issued by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on November 11th, emphasizing that the Korean issue can only be resolved by the Korean people themselves.

The article stated that American imperialism has consistently used the United Nations banner to achieve its sinister goals and has grossly interfered in the internal affairs of the Korean people. The article refuted the cliches of the American ruling clique's so-called "elections under United Nations supervision." The article pointed out that the United Nations, which launched a war of aggression against the Korean people as one of the belligerent parties, has no reason to discuss the Korean issue, let alone "supervise" the Korean people in expressing their own will.

The article demanded the immediate withdrawal of American troops from South Korean, and the immediate dissolution of the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unfication and Rehabilitation of Korea," which serves as a tool for American aggression, so that the Korean people can resolve the Korean issue themselves. The article criticized the United States and its puppets for consistently obstructing a reasonable solution to the Korean issue. The article stated that the Chinese People's Volunteers had already completely withdrawn from Korea in October 1958, but the American aggressor troops are still赖着 [refusing to leave] in South Korea, hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea and threatening peace and security in Asia and among the people of all countries.

The article concluded by expressing firm support for the proposal put forward by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its memorandum issued on November 11th of this year to establish a federation of South and North Korea as a transitional measure towards peaceful reunification, considering this to be an important step in resolving the Korean issue from the perspective of peace in the Far East and the world, and especially from the interests of the Korean people.

    蒙古“真理报”支持朝鲜政府备忘录
    要求美军撤出朝鲜南部
    新华社乌兰巴托16日电　蒙古“真理报”今天发表文章，支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在11月11日发表的关于朝鲜和平统一的备忘录，强调指出朝鲜问题只能由朝鲜人民自己解决。
    文章说，美帝国主义一直盗用联合国的招牌来达到自己的阴险目的，它粗暴地干涉朝鲜人民的内政。文章驳斥了美国统治集团叫嚷的所谓“联合国监督下的选举”的陈词滥调。文章指出，向朝鲜人民发动侵略战争的、作为参战国一方的联合国，根本没有理由讨论朝鲜问题，更没有理由“监督”朝鲜人民表达自己的意愿。
    文章要求立即使美国军队撤出朝鲜南部，立即解散作为美国侵略工具的所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”，让朝鲜人民自己解决朝鲜问题。文章指责美国及其仆从们一贯阻挠朝鲜问题的合理解决。文章说，中国人民志愿军早在1958年10月就已全部撤出朝鲜，但是美国侵略军直到现在还赖在朝鲜南部不走，阻挠朝鲜实现和平统一，威胁亚洲和各国人民的和平和安全。
    文章最后表示坚决支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在今年11月11日发表的备忘录中所提出的建立朝鲜南部和北部的联邦作为实现和平统一的一个过渡措施的建议，认为这是从远东和世界和平事业、特别是从朝鲜人民利益出发解决朝鲜问题的一项重要步骤。
