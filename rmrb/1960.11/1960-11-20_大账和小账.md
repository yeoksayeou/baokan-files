    Big Accounts and Small Accounts
    Yi Zhi
    Whether it's leading production or leading life, we must both calculate big accounts and calculate small accounts. Without calculating big accounts, we cannot accurately grasp the overall situation; without calculating small accounts, we cannot clearly see the specific problems.
    For a commune or a management area, there must be a comprehensive, year-round total in mind for grain consumption arrangements; moreover, we must look further ahead, seeing the bigger picture of the entire county, province, and even the whole country, seeing the situations that may occur in one, two, or even more years. Regardless of whether our region has a bumper harvest or a poor harvest this year, the arrangement of life must be adapted to the overall situation, and we must leave as much room as possible. With these big numbers in mind, we can have a clear direction and firm confidence.
    Calculating big accounts alone is not enough. From the perspective of totals and averages, there may be no problems for the whole commune, the whole management area, or the whole year; however, the situations of each team, each canteen, and each season cannot be exactly the same, and there may even be significant differences. Some teams and canteens have experience in planning grain use, while others lack experience in this regard; some canteens have a thicker family background in production, while others have a thinner one; the agricultural activities of each team and commune vary from season to season, and living habits will also be different; the work styles and abilities of the leaders and staff of each team and canteen are even more different. These will have a significant impact on the quality of life arrangements. After analyzing the overall grain situation in the entire management area, the Pingpo Management Area Party Branch of the Pingpo Commune in Dali, Yunnan, understood the specific situations of each team and canteen, sorted them out, calculated accounts, helped each canteen establish a grain use system, arranged planned grain use, and then mobilized the masses to discuss the grain use plan. The family background was shared from top to bottom, and plans were made from bottom to top. The grain use plans for each household were arranged meticulously and reasonably. In each canteen, everything was done according to the plan at every meal, and the small accounts were cleared every day. With big numbers and small numbers, the cadres and the masses were even clearer in their minds and had more confidence in living a better life.
    "Having 'numbers' in mind. This means that we must pay attention to the quantitative aspects of situations and problems and have a basic quantitative analysis. Any quality is expressed in a certain quantity, and without quantity, there is no quality." This is an important working method proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong in "Methods of Work of Party Committees." Without numbers in mind, it is impossible to correctly judge the nature of new things, and naturally, it is impossible to do things correctly. The purpose of accounting is not to be able to recite a large pile of numbers, but to understand the situation and essence of things and problems.
    Without numbers in mind, or only having a general big number or average, things will become "too generalized." "Too generalized" does not really "resolve" the problems, but only makes oneself unable to see them. Like the Pingpo Management Area Party Branch, calculating both big accounts and small accounts, having both big numbers and small numbers, can "resolve things in a small way"—understanding the situation and essence of each canteen, solving each specific problem, and truly "resolving" them.

    大账和小账
    易之
    无论是领导生产、领导生活，都要既算大账、又算小账。不算大账就不能明确地看准全局的形势，不算小账就不能清楚地看到具体的问题。
    就一个公社、一个管理区来说，对于粮食消费的安排，心里不能没有一个全面的、全年的总数；而且要把眼光放得更远大些，看到全县、全省以至全国的大局，看到一年、两年以至更长时间内可能发生的情况。不论自己的地区今年是丰收还是歉收，生活的安排都要同大局相适应，都要尽可能多留一些余地。心里有了这些大数，就可以有明确的方向，坚定的信心。
    光算大账还不够。从总数和平均数看，可能全社、全管理区、全年都没有什么问题；可是，各个队、各个食堂、各个季节的情况是不可能完全一样的，甚至会有很大差别。有的队和食堂计划用粮有经验，有的队和食堂在这方面还缺乏经验；有的食堂家底生产比较厚，有的食堂的家底比较薄；各队各社各个季节的农事活动情况不同，生活习惯也会有所不同；各队和各个食堂的领导人员、工作人员的作风、能力更不相同。这些，对于生活安排得好坏都会发生很大的影响。云南大理平坡公社平坡管理区党支部在分析了全管理区的粮食的全局之后，又逐队逐食堂了解具体情况，排队、算账，帮助各食堂建立用粮制度，安排计划用粮，然后又发动群众讨论用粮计划，自上而下交家底，自下而上作计划，逐户的用粮计划都作了周密合理的安排；在各个食堂里，顿顿饭按计划办事，小账天天算清。有了大数又有了小数，干部和群众心里就更加一清二楚，对于把日子过得更好更有信心。
    “胸中有‘数’。这是说，对情况和问题一定要注意到它们的数量方面，要有基本的数量的分析。任何质量都表现为一定的数量，没有数量也就没有质量。”这是毛泽东同志在《党委会的工作方法》中提出的一个重要的工作方法。胸中无数，就无法正确地判断新事物的性质，自然也就无法正确地办事情。算账的目的，并不是为了能够背诵一大堆数目字，而是为的了解事物和问题的情况和实质。
    胸中无数，或者只有一个笼统的大数或平均数，就会“大而化之”。“大而化之”，并不是真正把问题“化”掉了，只不过是使自己看不到它们罢了。像平坡管理区党支部这样，算大账又算小账，有大数又有小数，就能够“小而化之”——了解一个个食堂的情况和问题的实质，解决一个个的具体问题，把它们真正“化”掉。
