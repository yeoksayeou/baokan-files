Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 21st: Zhu Ziqi, the Chinese representative attending the recent Executive Committee meeting of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Beirut and Secretary-General of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, told Xinhua reporters while passing through here that "The Executive Committee meeting of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization was a successful one. It achieved great results. It fully reflects the spirit of unity, cooperation, and mutual support of the Asian-African countries in their struggle against the common enemies headed by US imperialism - imperialism and colonialism. Because prominent leaders of many mass organizations of important Asian-African countries and anti-imperialist fighters attended the meeting, the representation of the meeting was also very broad."

Speaking of the achievements of the meeting, Zhu Ziqi said: "The speeches of the representatives attending the meeting and the documents they adopted clearly pointed out that US imperialism is the common enemy of the Asian-African people." He said that since the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry in April this year, "the great feature of this region is that the storm against US imperialism has risen and expanded, and the meeting in Beirut also fully reflected this." He also said: "Representatives from Japan, North Korea, Vietnam, Algeria, Congo, Cameroon, and other countries cited many facts to angrily expose and condemn the US imperialist conspiracies and criminal acts of aggression against their countries. Among the more than twenty resolutions passed at the meeting, fifteen resolutions pointed this out."

Zhu Ziqi pointed out that "the most ferocious and cunning US imperialist jackal, although it sometimes wears sheep's clothing or changes some of its words, cannot deceive the increasingly awakened Asian-African people. An African representative pointed out that US imperialism has now become the head of colonialism." Zhu Ziqi also told reporters that a proposal passed by the Organizational Issues Subcommittee of the meeting argued that, with the cooperation of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Committees in various countries in the region, the Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization should investigate all the US imperialist aggression forces in the region and the crimes they have committed, and make them public to the world.

Zhu Ziqi continued, "It should also be pointed out that the meeting strongly opposed and condemned US imperialism's use of the United Nations to infringe upon the interests, freedom, and independence of many countries. The representatives cited many facts to prove that the United Nations had done many bad things against the Asian-African people in the past and present. They also emphasized that during the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations had left a shameful record on the issues of the Congo, Cuba, the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, support for colonialism, disarmament, peace, and a series of other issues." He emphasized that "This is indeed a new and significant lesson for those who still hold unrealistic illusions about the United Nations." Zhu Ziqi read to the reporter an important passage from the resolution on the United Nations passed at the meeting. The resolution pointed out: "As long as the United Nations is still under the control of imperialism and ignores the legitimate rights of the people of all countries, the United Nations Charter will never be respected by the United Nations, and this organization can never maintain its prestige or meet the hopes placed in it by the people of all countries."

Zhu Ziqi also said that many representatives expressed their belief in their speeches that exposing and opposing imperialism's use of the United Nations as a tool to infringe upon the interests of the Asian-African people is a constant task of the Asian-African solidarity movement. They also believed that there should be no illusions about the actual situation of the United Nations, but rather vigilance should be maintained.

Zhu Ziqi pointed out that another achievement of the meeting was the call for the Asian-African people to rise up against imperialist aggression and strive for genuine peaceful coexistence. He said, "In the discussion of this issue, certain vague claims were clarified. Many representatives said that without eradicating colonialism in Asia and Africa, and without eliminating imperialist aggression and war forces in Asia and Africa, there would be no genuine peaceful coexistence in this region. A resolution unanimously passed at the meeting emphasized that peaceful coexistence between independent national states with different systems is necessary and possible. However, peaceful coexistence between the colonial people and the anti-imperialist people on the one hand and the imperialist and colonialist system on the other is impossible." Zhu Ziqi said that, as one African representative said, "We can never agree to and tolerate 'peaceful coexistence between the knight and the horse'."

Zhu Ziqi said that the meeting also gave a clear answer to the question of how the Asian-African people can win their own victory in their struggle against imperialism and for national independence. Many representatives believed in their speeches that the recent declaration of independence by a series of African countries was entirely the result of the long-term anti-imperialist struggle of the people of these countries, and their independence was not a gift from imperialism, nor was it won through the United Nations.

Zhu Ziqi said that the meeting also passed a special resolution fully supporting the Cuban people's struggle against American aggression and interference. He said that the general resolution passed at the meeting said that the Executive Committee instructed the Secretariat to immediately contact the various liberation movements in Latin America in order to establish a united anti-imperialist front. Zhu Ziqi pointed out that "This call will powerfully encourage the common struggle of the Asian-African and Latin American people for national independence and against US imperialism. This also shows that a powerful united front on a world scale against US imperialism and its running dogs is forming and developing."

Zhu Ziqi also spoke about the friendly feelings and enthusiastic support of many representatives for China. He said that the meeting passed a resolution condemning the United States for obstructing the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and he expressed his gratitude for this friendly support. He pointed out that this proves that the great friendship between the Chinese people and the Asian-African people is developing and consolidating in their common struggle.

Zhu Ziqi finally talked about the significance of the meeting. He said, "There is no doubt that the results of this meeting will not only strengthen and effectively promote the solidarity movement of the Asian-African people against imperialism, but will also contribute to the cause of opposing imperialist war and aggression forces and defending world peace."

    朱子奇谈亚非人民团结组织执委会会议成就
    亚非人民在反帝斗争中团结日益加强
    反对美帝国主义的强大统一战线正在形成和发展中
    据新华社大马士革21日电　参加最近在贝鲁特举行的亚非人民团结组织执行委员会会议的中国代表、中国亚非团结委员会秘书长朱子奇，在路过这里时对新华社记者说，“亚非人民团结组织执行委员会会议是开得成功的。它取得了巨大的成就。它充分反映了亚非各国人民反对以美帝国主义为首的共同敌人——帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争中团结、合作和互相支持的精神。由于重要的亚非国家的许多群众团体的著名领导人以及反帝战士出席了这次会议，所以这次会议的代表性也是非常广泛的。”
    谈到这次会议的成就时，朱子奇说：“出席会议的代表们的发言，以及他们所通过的文件清楚地指出，美帝国主义是亚非各国人民的共同的敌人。”他说，自从今年4月在科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会以来，“这个地区的巨大的特点是，反对美帝国主义的风暴已经兴起和扩大了，在贝鲁特举行的这次会议也充分地反映了这一点。”他又说：“日本、朝鲜、越南、阿尔及利亚、刚果、喀麦隆以及其他国家的代表们都列举了许多事实来愤怒地揭露和谴责美帝国主义对他们的国家的阴谋和罪恶的侵略活动。会上通过的二十多个决议中，就有十五个决议指明这一点。”
    朱子奇指出，“最凶恶、最狡猾的美帝国主义野心狼，尽管它有时披上了绵羊的皮，或者改变它的一些词句，但是它是骗不了日益觉醒的亚非各国人民的。一位非洲代表指出，美帝国主义今天已成了殖民主义的头子。”朱子奇还告诉记者说，会议的关于组织问题的小组委员会通过的一项建议主张，在这个地区的各国亚非人民团结委员会的合作之下，亚非人民团结组织书记处应该调查美帝国主义在这个地区的一切侵略部队以及它们所犯下的罪行，并将它公诸于全世界。
    朱子奇接着说，“还应该指出，会议强烈反对并谴责美帝国主义利用联合国来侵犯许多国家的利益、自由和独立。代表们列举了许多事实来证明联合国过去和现在做了反对亚非各国人民的许多坏事。他们还强调指出，在联合国大会第十五届会议期间，在刚果、古巴、恢复中国在联合国的合法席位问题上，在支持殖民主义问题上，在裁军、和平以及其他一系列的问题上，联合国又留下了可耻的记录。”他强调说，“对联合国还抱着不现实的幻想的人们，这的确是一个新的和意义重大的教训。”朱子奇向记者宣读了在会上通过的关于联合国决议的重要一段。决议指出：“只要联合国还在帝国主义控制之下，并无视各国人民的正当权利，联合国宪章就永远不会受到联合国的尊重，这个组织也决不能保持它的威望、决不能满足各国人民所寄于它的希望。”
    朱子奇又说，许多代表们在自己的发言中表示相信，揭露和反对帝国主义利用联合国作为侵犯亚非各国人民利益的工具，是亚非团结运动的一个经常的任务。他们还相信，对联合国的实际情况不应该抱幻想，而是应该保持警惕。
    朱子奇指出，会议的另一项成就是，号召亚非各国人民奋起反对帝国主义侵略，并争取实现真正的和平共处。他说，“在就这个问题上进行讨论的时候，某些含糊的主张得到了澄清，许多代表说，不根除在亚非两洲的殖民主义、不消灭在亚非两洲的帝国主义侵略和战争势力，在这个地区就不会有真正的和平共处。会议一致通过的一项决议强调指出，在不同制度的民族独立国家之间的和平共处是必要的，也是可能的。但是，在殖民地人民和反帝人民为一方同帝国主义和殖民主义制度为另一方之间是不可能实现和平共处的。”朱子奇说，正如一位非洲代表所说的那样，“我们决不能同意和忍受‘骑士和马之间的和平共处’”。
    朱子奇说，对于亚非各国人民怎样能在他们反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的斗争中赢得自己胜利的问题，会议也作出了明确的答复。许多代表在讲话中认为，最近一系列非洲国家宣布独立，这完全是这些国家的人民进行了长期反帝斗争的结果，他们的独立并不是帝国主义恩赐的，也不是通过联合国赢得的。
    朱子奇说，这次会议还通过了一项特别决议，完全支持古巴人民反对美国侵略和干涉的斗争。他说，会上通过的总决议说，执行委员会责成书记处立即同拉丁美洲的各个解放运动取得联系，以便建立反帝统一阵线。朱子奇指出，“这项呼吁将有力地鼓舞亚非和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族独立和反对美帝国主义的共同斗争。这也表明了，反对美帝国主义及其走狗的、世界规模的强大统一战线正在形成和发展中。”
    朱子奇还谈到许多代表对中国的友好感情和热烈支持。他说，会议通过了一项关于谴责美国阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位的决议，他对这种友好的支持表示感谢。他指出，这证明了中国人民和亚非各国人民之间的伟大友谊正在他们的共同斗争中日益发展和巩固。
    朱子奇最后谈到了这次会议的意义。他说，“毫无疑问，这次会议的结果，不仅将加强和有效地促进亚非各国人民反对帝国主义的团结运动，而且将有助于反对帝国主义战争和侵略势力和保卫世界和平的事业。”
