    Strive to Reflect New Things in Rural Life
    ——On Several Characteristics of Li Zhun's Short Stories
    Yao Wenyuan

		I
    Comrade Li Zhun's creation has seen new development since the Great Leap Forward in 1958. In works such as "Spring Breeze in March," "A String of Keys," and especially in this year's "The Biography of Li Shuangshuang" and "Geng Yun Ji" [Record of Cultivating Clouds], two works with strong revolutionary spirit and profound ideological significance, we see a new and beautiful picture of the socialist countryside illuminated by the three red banners. Here, the words "new" and "beautiful" are used because a characteristic of Comrade Li Zhun's creation is a keen sense of fresh things and a fervent praise for them. The aesthetic feeling that his artistic images give to the reader is first and foremost their "newness." This is not a contrived novelty, but the fresh and lively vigor of revolutionary new things. The brand-new countryside, brand-new life, and the new people with brand-new spiritual outlooks growing up in the struggle give Comrade Li Zhun's works of this period a revolutionary youthful atmosphere, with a force that encourages people to keep moving forward. We can feel the strong vitality of the people's commune from his works, and the new socialist life is surging forward, breaking through all kinds of stale things.

    Being good at keenly perceiving the emerging forces in the real struggle, and timely using artistic images to reflect, support, and praise the new things in life, is a consistent feature of Comrade Li Zhun's creation. This makes his creation closely linked to reality. If we look at the history of Comrade Li Zhun's creation, we can see that in each of the main stages from agricultural cooperativization to the people's commune, Comrade Li Zhun always timely created those new figures who represent the socialist direction and are advancing in the fierce struggle. From 1953 to early 1954, when the spontaneous forces of capitalism in the countryside were intensifying their activities, the phenomenon of class differentiation had already appeared, and the struggle between the socialist road of mutual aid and cooperation and the capitalist road was becoming increasingly sharp, Comrade Li Zhun wrote "Cannot Take That Road" and "White Poplar," resolutely criticizing the spontaneous thoughts of peasants who wanted to take the capitalist road, resolutely supporting and praising the Communist Party members Song Dongshan and Dong Jinming who adhered to the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and convincingly portraying the superiority of mutual aid groups over individual farming, showing that the socialist road is the only correct road to guide peasants to common prosperity from the victory of the road of mutual aid and cooperation. "Cannot Take That Road" had a wide impact at the time, using socialist class education to make people see clearly what road they should take, sounding the alarm to those who wanted to take the old capitalist road, and becoming an excellent work that powerfully served proletarian politics. In 1954, after the cooperativization movement had further developed, Comrade Li Zhun created images of peasants with a strong sense of collectivism and creative advanced figures, who concentratedly expressed the noble style of socialism and reflected the superiority of cooperatives. For example, Meng Guangtai in "Old Man Meng Guangtai" is a selfless peasant who loves the cooperative like his home and puts the public interest above his personal interests. He cherishes every straw of wheat in the cooperative and strives wholeheartedly for the collective interest. Jin Ling in "Chen Qiao Ferry" is the image of a revolutionary youth who adheres to principles and struggles against capitalist ideological styles within the cooperative. In July 1955, when the high tide of cooperativization arrived, Comrade Li Zhun created Dong Ying, an advanced figure who was determined to run a nursery, in "Busy Farming in May." In this novel, the author had already keenly touched on the issue of liberating women's labor force, and used artistic images to show the important significance of running nurseries for agricultural production. Striving to reflect the new socialist things in the countryside can be said to be a more distinct characteristic of Comrade Li Zhun's creation.

    However, if we compare his works after 1958, especially his recent works, with those before 1958, we can see that there has been a more significant improvement in both ideological and artistic qualities. The strengthening of revolutionary ideals makes the works have a broader vision and a stronger exciting power, with a more majestic momentum. In the past, there were individual works, such as "The Letter," which wrote about a young woman whose husband died in the Korean War. Because she was afraid that her mother-in-law would be too sad after knowing the news, she used the method of making up fake letters written by her husband to comfort and enlighten her mother-in-law who did not know the truth. Although such works also touch on the fortitude and strength of young women from one side, it always makes people feel that there is still a lack of something higher than personal encounters, so it cannot produce a stronger encouraging force. However, the works after 1958 have changed this situation. In a story, in a vivid image of a new person, we can hear the footsteps of the era, like "The Biography of Li Shuangshuang," we can see a thriving new atmosphere in the great people's commune, and feel the power of revolutionary ideals, as if standing at a high place overlooking the progress of the era. In terms of character shaping, the character is more distinct and prominent, and the spiritual world of the character is unfolded in the greater waves of struggle, so the image of the heroic character is taller and more vigorous. For example, Dong Ying and Li Shuangshuang are both advanced figures among women, but the typical significance of the image of Li Shuangshuang is greater than that of Dong Ying, because in "Busy Farming in May," only the contradiction between Dong Ying's desire to run a nursery and the conservatives during the busy farming season is highlighted, while Li Shuangshuang unfolds her growing experience in the entire rural Great Leap Forward and people's communization, naturally giving people a deeper impression. This is on the one hand a reflection of the development of the era itself in the creation; on the other hand, it is also the result of the author's ideological level being improved.

    There are two characteristics that we should pay attention to, why Comrade Li Zhun's description of new things and new characters in his creation during this period is so excellent.

    The first characteristic is that the author more fully expresses the power of new things, and expresses the origin of this power from the revolutionary development of the era; because it fully embodies the requirements of the further development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, it also has infinitely broad prospects. Li Shuangshuang is an advanced figure who is at the forefront of the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement. The reason why this cheerful and brave young woman appears so radiant is not only because she more concentratedly and ideally embodies the new character of women who have been completely liberated from housework after the people's communization, but also because of her revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, and never bowing to any difficulties, her rapid political growth under the leadership of the Party, her serious and selfless attitude of adhering to principles, and her close and comrade-like care for her lover, all express the spirit of our era, and condense the beautiful ideals of the revolutionary people to build a new life. Every step of Li Shuangshuang's character development, whether participating in labor or running the canteen well, is closely linked to the development and consolidation of the entire people's commune, so that we convincingly feel that her every move expresses revolutionary vigor, which is precisely the artistic expression of the productive forces further liberated after the people's communization. From Li Shuangshuang, we can see the great superiority of the people's commune. Li Shuangshuang said: "Now it is the Party's leadership, as long as we stand upright, we can go all over the world with reason, what else is there to be afraid of." This spirit of daring to struggle and being the master of one's own house is precisely the high-spirited mental state of the Chinese people who cannot be frightened or stopped by any difficulties, and who are advancing by leaps and bounds. Xiao Shuying in "Geng Yun Ji" concentratedly reflects the revolutionary character of the new type of peasants who have mastered scientific knowledge, and prominently expresses the great power of the people's commune in overcoming natural disasters. In the people's commune under the leadership of the Party, Xiao Shuying has the inevitability of her growth: the people's commune needs new people who can independently observe the climate and predict the wind and rain, and the people's commune will surely grow such new people. Xiao Shuying said: "To be honest, these achievements are all the Party's, if it were not for the Party, how would we know the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, how would we know the mass line?" The reason why such a young girl can master the changes in the wind and clouds in space is not just a scientific knowledge issue, but first and foremost because of the correctness of the Party's line, which is precisely a fundamental reason why the image of this little girl appears more powerful than the wind and rain in the sky. The meteorologist Xiao Shuying, who has mastered the laws of nature, stands on the top of Yushan Mountain, in the midst of lightning and thunder, watching the vast sea of clouds shining on her predictions rolling eastward under her feet, and the heavy rain never falls on the land of their commune. At this moment, how strongly we feel that this little girl is more powerful than the howling storm. A large number of peasants who have mastered scientific knowledge are emerging in the countryside, and thousands of workers and peasants are advancing towards the path of intellectualizing the workers in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Xiao Shuying is precisely to a certain extent expressing the ideal and realistic heroic image of the Chinese working people. These two examples both show that: to describe individual advanced figures, only by showing that they are standing at the forefront of the era, produced from the changes of the era, and are representatives of the emerging forces that promote the further development of the era, can their vitality be displayed, and can the artistic image have stronger typicality. If the writer does not have revolutionary ideals, does not have a communist world outlook, it is impossible to see why new things have strong vitality.

    The second characteristic of Comrade Li Zhun's description of new characters and new things is to realistically express the growth of new things and new characters from actual struggles, to carve the strong character of the characters from the struggles, and to give the character a distinct character of the era in the struggles. New things and new characters are shining brightly and showing the lofty spiritual world of heroic characters precisely in the struggle against capitalist forces, conservative and backward habitual forces, and difficulties in work. Li Shuangshuang's character full of revolutionary vitality is vividly carved out in the continuous struggle. The beginning is the struggle with her lover's petty-bourgeois habits, and the second time is the struggle with the well-to-do middle peasant Sun You and Jin Qiao who is full of selfish thoughts. Without these struggles, it would be difficult to make the image of Li Shuangshuang so radiant and so rich in the characteristics of the era as it is now. Xiao Shuying's heroic character of being responsible to the Party and the people's cause is expressed in her struggle with the difficulties in weather forecasting. Her revolutionary firmness is also expressed in her being unmoved by the ridicule and suspicion of well-to-do middle peasants and a few backward masses. If Xiao Shuying mastered the laws of meteorology very easily, Xiao Shuying would not be the Xiao Shuying she is now.

		II
    Looking at Comrade Li Zhun's novels as a whole, there is a general line of development running through them, which is to reflect the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in the countryside. In his creation, he reflected the sharpness and complexity of the rural class struggle. Many of Comrade Li Zhun's works accurately grasp the trend of rural class struggle in this period, powerfully expose the destructive activities of capitalist forces, criticize some peasants who are influenced by bourgeois ideology, and give readers a positive class education. The rural picture that Comrade Li Zhun has drawn for us is a picture of advancing step by step in the struggle. In his own words, his creation "is all about narrating stories and characters along such a line - that is, the struggle between brand-new socialist ideas and decadent capitalist ideas." (Postscript to "The Track of the Wheels")

    Comrade Li Zhun's works reflect the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, which can be roughly divided into two types. One type of criticism is directly aimed at the rich peasants and some well-to-do middle peasants who insist on taking the capitalist road. The author is good at thoroughly exposing the destructive means of capitalist forces, and expressing from the struggle the great significance of defeating capitalist forces for building a socialist countryside. In Comrade Li Zhun's works, we can see that this class struggle has different characteristics in different periods. "Ice Melting and Snow Disappearing" exposes how the hidden rich peasant Liu Erxing used the method of organizing fake cooperatives to destroy cooperativization when the cooperativization movement began to develop, corrupting and deceiving the Party member Wei Hutou who had serious capitalist ideas, insidiously attempting to restore exploitation under the guise of cooperatives. "The Story of the 'Three-Eyed Gun' Dropping Its Mouth" exposes the rich middle peasant Pei Sibei who hated the unified purchase and sale system, provoking an old poor peasant Pei Xihe who was straightforward but somewhat confused in his thinking, to "fire cannons" for him against the unified purchase and sale system. However, in "The Biography of Li Shuangshuang," Li Shuangshuang's sharp struggle with the rich middle peasant Sun You is concentrated on the canteen issue, because running a canteen is a very big transformation after the people's communization, and is the fundamental key to doing a good job in collective life, so insisting on running a good canteen has become the focus of class struggle. In these stories, the author on the one hand praises and describes the advanced figures who resolutely struggle against capitalist forces, and on the other hand criticizes the backward figures who waver in their stand or have vague ideas. In the end, those who aspire to capitalist restoration always fall into complete failure and isolation. The author conducts sharp exposure and blows against those representatives of anti-socialist forces.

    Another type is to criticize capitalist ideas among some cadres and peasants. These people themselves are not anti-socialist elements, but have more serious capitalist ideas, or because they only care about their personal immediate interests, they have conflicts with the cooperativization and people's communization movement. Such as Song Laoding who wants to buy land in "Cannot Take That Road," Bai Jufeng who still wants to rely on his son and daughter-in-law to be lazy and enjoy the ready-made in "A String of Keys," and Xi Wang who has a fierce conflict with his wife in "The Biography of Li Shuangshuang," are all people of this type. They can either finally embark on the socialist road, or overcome their wavering on the socialist road through criticism and help; but on some issues involving personal interests, they still maintain the psychology and habits of petty-bourgeois, so in the development process of the socialist collective cause, they have conflicts with those old ideas and old habits. Comrade Li Zhun's works widely touch on this type of internal contradictions among the people. The attitude of the works towards these characters is different from that towards those class enemies who hate and destroy the socialist cause. The author seriously points out their shortcomings, and at the same time shows that they can move towards progress in criticism and self-criticism. The experiences of these characters are mostly comedic, and their backward side has a very uncoordinated contradiction with reality, causing them to fall into a predicament at a certain stage, and have some behaviors that contradict the actions of the broad masses, and are opposed and criticized by the masses, but in the end they still come to the road of progress and tend to be consistent with the trend of the times. Their erroneous ideas have been criticized, but the overall impression given to us by the whole image in the end is still good, and it does not make readers hate them to the end like those bad guys. For example, Bai Jufeng in "A String of Keys," in his mind, he still wants to rely on the status of "head of the family" to monopolize the family's economic power in his own hands, and not allow his son and daughter-in-law to have the right to independently control their labor income, so as to rely on others' labor to support himself. This kind of thinking is unanimously opposed by the family members. When he "decentralizes power" after the family meeting, the family relationship does not deteriorate, but becomes more harmonious. These, in terms of the nature of ideological struggle, are still the struggle between socialist ideas and capitalist ideas, which can only be that one side wins over the other, and cannot be blurred; in terms of people, it is not that one side collapses as the other side wins, but through the method of "unity - criticism - unity", it tortuously leads them towards progress.

    To lead the cooperativization and people's communization movement well, there must be strong leading cadres. Comrade Li Zhun's novels have created many images of excellent leading cadres. They firmly implement the Party's class line and various policies, fight loyally for the Party's cause, closely link with the masses, and struggle against the phenomenon of violating the Party's line and policies. Parallel to praising these excellent grass-roots leading cadres, the author also criticizes some cadres' ideological and working styles. In "Ice Melting and Snow Disappearing," three types of leading cadres are vividly described: one type is the broad mass of excellent leading cadres represented by Zheng Deming, the Party branch secretary and director of the Red Flag Cooperative, who correctly embody the Party's leadership. Zheng Deming adhered to the Party's class line and carried out irreconcilable struggles with the rich peasants' destructive behavior and the mistakes of individual Party members surrendering to capitalist forces. At the same time, he adhered to unity, opposed the impatience and complacency of cadres like Liu Mainao, and finally united the broad masses of peasants, thoroughly exposing the rich peasants' conspiracy. The second type, Liu Mainao, is determined to take the socialist road, but lacks patience and is not good at using persuasion methods to deal with the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, and also shows complacency in the relationship with other small cooperatives, resulting in affecting the unity between cooperatives, and being exploited by rich peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. The third type of cadre is individual, such as Hutou, who has serious capitalist ideas, is confused by the rich peasants' provocation, cannot see the class enemies' destructive behavior, and abandons the socialist position. The author enthusiastically praises Zheng Deming, sharply criticizes Hutou who has lost his stand, and also criticizes Mainao's mistakes as actually being beneficial to the class enemies and not conducive to socialism. After Mainao and the cadres of the Red Flag Cooperative corrected their working style, the broad masses of peasants united around the Party, and a small group of saboteurs was exposed and thoroughly revealed. The practical working style embodied in the Party Secretary Lin, Secretary Guan, and Xiao Shuying in "Geng Yun Ji" has great practical significance. They closely combine the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to take responsibility with in-depth investigation and research; closely combine strategically despising difficulties with tactically valuing difficulties; closely combine the data in the laboratory with the wisdom of the masses, so they can grasp the real situation and prescribe the right medicine, and achieve the victory of the anti-drought struggle. Even at the end, based on sufficient materials, they determined that the rainstorm would not pass over the mountain and could temporarily not release water, but they still prepared two hands from two possibilities, organized the young and middle-aged forces to guard the embankment, and made the worst plan. This makes their work invincible. At the beginning of the novel, the author prominently portrayed Secretary Guan and Xiao Shuying as answering everything unusually accurately, when the wind blows, it rains, how many acres of land are planted with what, and how many times the fertilizer has been applied, all explained with accurate numbers, without any ambiguous answers, giving us a very strong impression. This down-to-earth energy is precisely the realistic working style that Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us, which is also summarized by Secretary Lin as "based on facts, based on investigation, based on research" on all issues. All the victories of the Yushan People's Commune are inseparable from this working style. This realistic working style expressed by the vivid artistic image in this novel is worthy of great promotion. This novel has reached a higher ideological level than Comrade Li Zhun's previous works of this type.

    Here, we can see the extremely important significance of striving to study Chairman Mao's writings and mastering Mao Zedong Thought for creation, and we can see the decisive role of the gradual improvement of the writer's Marxist-Leninist ideological level in creation and development on the basis of going deep into life. Even in the anti-Rightist struggle and the national rectification in the first half of 1957, Comrade Li Zhun's creation was also negatively affected in a short period of time, and he took a small detour. For example, "When Reed Flowers are White" was clearly influenced by the fallacy of so-called "exposing the dark side," and the novel does not see the kind of vigorous new atmosphere that Comrade Li Zhun's previous and subsequent works showed. This is precisely because the author did not firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, so he lost his way for a while. Although this is already a thing of the past, today's new achievements in Comrade Li Zhun's creative ideology and art, compared with the small detour in the past, do they not illustrate the decisive role of the world outlook on creation? Only by constantly studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we correctly express the great struggles of this great era. We can only use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to understand reality, generalize life, and make our creation constantly develop to a higher ideological and artistic level.

		III
    Comrade Li Zhun's short stories also have obvious improvements in artistic description, mainly reflected in the fact that the artistic generalization is stronger than in the past.

    The issue of artistic generalization is how the life described in the work originates from actual life, but is higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life, and therefore is also more universal and can more powerfully promote the forward development of reality. The stronger the artistic generalization, the greater the artistic appeal to the reader, and the more the reader can strongly feel the development of the entire era from the artistic work. Whether in the past or now, generally speaking, Comrade Li Zhun's works are all derived from actual rural life. He does not fabricate stories by departing from actual life. There is always a strong atmosphere of life in his works. Comrade Li Zhun is very familiar with the character characteristics and living habits of the peasants. A simple and realistic writing style, vivid and mass-based language, and the harmonious consistency between the language of describing life and the characters' language are consistent characteristics of Comrade Li Zhun's creation. His novels have a relatively distinct national style. Works such as "The Biography of Li Shuangshuang" and "Geng Yun Ji" not only have the above artistic characteristics, but also have greater artistic appeal to readers than in the past. why is that? First, the art is more refined than in the past, and the processing of "removing the dross and retaining the essence" is done better. Some of the previous works seemed cluttered and lengthy in content, while the current works are mostly developed around a central idea in the processing of materials, and irrelevant things are omitted, thus appearing more concentrated. For example, "A String of Keys," "Spring Breeze in March," and "The Biography of Li Shuangshuang" can all concentrate artistic descriptions on the focus of the theme thought. Second, in the past works, the author still focused on forming the structure of the work by narrating the story, and when describing the characters, more attention was paid to expressing the individual characteristics of the characters' characters from the development of the story, and less attention was paid to reflecting the spirit of the times in the characters' spiritual outlook. In the recent period of works, not only the description of the characters' characters is more vivid, but also more attention is paid to reflecting the atmosphere of the entire era from the characters' spiritual outlook. Reflecting the characteristics of the era from the spiritual outlook of advanced figures, and paying more attention to reflecting the new human relationship from the relationship between the characters, so the typicality of the characters' characters and the entire work is strengthened. Compare two novels: "Forestry Committee" and "Two Generations," both of which are not long, one is more than 6,000 words, and the other is more than 8,000 words. Both works praise advanced figures in the countryside. The former praises two young people: one is the young girl "model worker" Shen Yufeng, and the other is the young man Xiushan, a good hand in afforestation in the Yellow River Agricultural Cooperative; the latter praises the two generations of mother and daughter in the agricultural cooperative: the mother Gao Xiuzhen is the newly appointed director of the winery, and the daughter Zhuzhu is the newly appointed director of the Women's Federation. But the latter gives the reader a stronger impression than the former. why? In "Forestry Committee," the images of the two advanced figures, Shen Yufeng and Xiushan, are also bright and vivid, and the reality and ideals are also beautiful, and they are also healthy in ideology. The story of this novel is that Shen Yufeng went to Xiushan's cooperative to visit the afforestation. In the process of visiting, it showed Shen Yufeng's enthusiasm, humility, and Xiushan's liveliness and diligence. However, from the image of these two very lovable young advanced figures, in addition to their own excellent qualities, we cannot strongly feel the profound changes caused by the cooperativization period; in the relationship between Shen Yufeng and Xiushan, in addition to the plot making them contact, there is also a lack of carefully reflecting the entire new rural relationship from the relationship between the characters. "Two Generations" has obviously made great progress. Although there are only two characters, Gao Xiuzhen's spiritual outlook strongly reflects the great and rapid changes in the entire rural life during the Great Leap Forward and the people's communization. As soon as we come into contact with Gao Xiuzhen's excited and energetic mood, we immediately feel the breath of the Great Leap Forward coming towards us. The author closely connects the characters' characters with the changes of the times, vividly and figuratively describes the characters' spiritual outlook, and reflects the huge changes in the countryside from the characters' excited and happy mood. Gao Xiuzhen's old and strong, full of energy, and striving forward character is a mirror of this leap-forward era that is changing so quickly and well, and conversely, the strong era color makes Gao Xiuzhen's mood full of infectiousness, making it easy for readers to be moved and resonate. The arrangement of Gao Xiuzhen and Zhuzhu's relationship in "Two Generations" is not just about transferring jobs, but writing their two jobs as a connected relationship, which deepens the significance of the work: the two generations are not only two generations in age, but also two revolutionary generations closely following the progress in their careers.

    Short stories are very prosperous in our country's literary creation, especially in recent years, showing a scene of a hundred flowers blooming, and a large number of excellent works with distinct national characteristics and characteristics of the times have emerged. Comrade Li Zhun's creation is one of them. Readers hope that Comrade Li Zhun will continue to move forward in the direction of "The Biography of Li Shuangshuang" and "Geng Yun Ji," and create more and better works for us. Comrade Li Zhun said in the postscript to the book "The Track of the Wheels": "From Song Laoding's getting rich and wanting to buy land, to Bai Jufeng's 'decentralizing' the last few keys to his daughter-in-law after the people's communization, ... I myself look back and feel how big the changes in our motherland's countryside are!" Yes, the changes in the past eleven years are great changes, but greater changes are yet to come, and greater victories are yet to come. I believe that in Comrade Li Zhun's future works, we will definitely be able to see greater changes in the Chinese countryside and Chinese peasants, and see greater victories in the socialist and communist cause on Chinese soil!

    努力反映农村生活中的新事物
    ——谈李准短篇小说的几个特点
    姚文元		一
    李准同志的创作，在1958年大跃进之后有了新的发展。在《三月里的春风》、《一串钥匙》等作品中，特别是在今年发表的《李双双小传》和《耕云记》这两篇有强烈的革命精神和深刻的思想意义的作品中，我们看到了一幅在三面红旗照耀下社会主义农村又新又美的图画。这里用了新和美这两个字，因为李准同志创作的一个特点，就是对于新鲜事物的敏锐感觉和热烈歌颂。他所塑造的艺术形象给予读者的美感，首先就是它的新。这不是故作新奇的新，而是革命新事物的那种新鲜活泼的朝气。崭新的农村，崭新的生活，从斗争中成长起来的有着崭新的精神面貌的新人，使李准同志这一时期的作品洋溢着革命的青春气息，有一股激励人们不断前进的鼓舞力量。我们可以从他的作品中感到人民公社的强大的生命力，社会主义的新生活正冲破着各种陈腐的事物向前涌流着。
    善于敏锐地察觉现实斗争中的新生力量，及时地用艺术形象反映、支持、歌颂生活中的新事物，是李准同志创作的一贯的特点。这使得他的创作同现实结合得很紧。我们看一看李准同志创作的历史，就可以看出从农业合作化到人民公社化各个主要阶段上，李准同志总是及时地创造了在剧烈斗争中前进的那些代表社会主义方向的新人物。1953年到1954年初，在农村资本主义自发势力加紧活动，阶级分化的现象已经在出现，互助合作的社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争日趋尖锐的时候，李准同志写了《不能走那一条路》和《白杨树》，坚决批判了农民中想走资本主义道路的自发思想，坚决支持了和歌颂了坚持互助合作道路的共产党员宋东山和董进明，并且令人信服地描写了互助组对单干的优越性，从互助合作道路的胜利中，显示出社会主义道路是引导农民走向共同富裕的唯一正确的道路。《不能走那一条路》在当时起了广泛的影响，以社会主义的阶级教育，使人们看清了应当走什么道路，向想走资本主义旧路的人敲起了警钟，成为有力地为无产阶级政治服务的一篇优秀作品。1954年，在合作化运动有了进一步发展后，李准同志创造了富有集体主义思想的农民和富有创造性的先进人物的形象，在他们身上集中地表现了社会主义的高尚风格，反映了合作社的优越性。如《孟广泰老头》中的孟广泰，就是一个爱社如家、把公共利益放在个人利益之上的大公无私的农民，他爱惜合作社的每一根麦秸棍，一心一意为了集体利益而奋斗。《陈桥渡口》中的金岭，是坚持原则、同合作社内资本主义思想作风作斗争的革命青年的形象。在合作化高潮来到的1955年7月，李准同志在《农忙五月天》中，塑造了一个坚决要把托儿所办起来的先进人物东英。在这篇小说中，作者已经敏锐地接触到解放妇女劳动力的问题，并用艺术形象显示了办托儿所对于农业生产的重要的意义。努力反映农村中社会主义新事物，可以说是李准同志创作中一个比较鲜明的特色。
    但是，如果把他的1958年以后的作品，特别是最近的作品，同1958年以前的作品相比较，就可以看出，无论在思想性和艺术性上，都有了比较显著的提高。革命理想的加强，使作品具有更加开阔的视野和更强的激动人心的力量，具有一种更加磅礴的气势。过去有个别的作品，例如《信》，写的是丈夫在朝鲜战争中牺牲了的一个青年妇女，因为怕婆婆知道消息后太伤心，就用编出丈夫写的假信的方法，安慰和启发还不知真情的婆婆。这样的作品，虽然也从一个侧面接触到青年妇女的刚毅坚强，但总使人感到，那里面还缺少一点超过个人遭遇的更高的东西，因而不能产生更强大的鼓舞力量。但1958年以后的作品，就改变了这样的情况，在一个故事中，在一个新人的鲜明的形象中，我们可以听到时代前进的脚步声，像《李双双小传》，我们可以看到伟大的人民公社中一片蓬蓬勃勃的新气象，可以感到革命理想的力量，仿佛是站在高处俯视了时代的进程。在人物塑造上，性格更加鲜明突出，人物的精神世界在更大的斗争波涛中展开，因而英雄人物的形象更加高大，更加生龙活虎。如东英和李双双，同是妇女中的先进人物，但李双双这个形象的典型意义，就比东英更大，因为《农忙五月天》中，只突出了农忙期间东英要办托儿所同保守主义者的矛盾，而李双双却是在整个农村大跃进、人民公社化中展开她成长的经历，自然给予人的印象更要深刻一些。这一方面是时代本身的发展在创作中的反映；另一方面，也是由于作者思想水平得到了提高的结果。
    李准同志这一时期创作中对于新事物、新人物的描写之所以十分出色，有下面两个特点是我们值得注意的。
    第一个特点，是作者比较充分地表现了新事物的力量，并且从时代的革命发展中，表现了这种力量的由来；是因为充分体现了社会主义革命和社会主义建设进一步发展的要求，因而也就有着无限广阔的前途。李双双是一个在大跃进、人民公社运动中走在前头的先进人物，这个爽朗、勇敢的青年妇女之所以显得那样光采照人，不仅因为在她身上更集中地、更理想地表现了人民公社化以后，从家务劳动中彻底解放出来的妇女的新的性格，而且还因为她身上那种敢想、敢说、敢干、决不向任何困难低头的革命精神，她在党的领导下政治上的飞速成长，她坚持原则的严肃的无私的态度，她对于爱人亲密而又是同志式的关怀，都表现着我们这个时代的时代精神，凝结着革命人民建设新生活的美好理想。李双双性格发展的每一个步骤，无论是参加劳动或办好食堂，都同整个人民公社的发展和巩固紧紧地联系着，因而使我们信服地感到：她的一举一动都表现着革命朝气，正是人民公社化之后进一步解放了的生产力在艺术上的表现，从李双双身上可以看出人民公社巨大的优越性。李双双说：“如今是党领导，咱只要立得正，有理走遍天下，还有什么怕。”这种敢于斗争、当家作主的主人翁气魄，正是任何困难也吓不倒、拦不住、而大步前进的中国人民意志昂扬的精神状态。《耕云记》中的萧淑英，集中地反映了掌握科学知识的新型农民的革命性格，突出地表现了人民公社在战胜自然灾害中的巨大力量。在党领导下的人民公社中，萧淑英有她成长的必然性：人民公社需要有独立地观察气候、预测风雨的新人，人民公社中就一定会成长出这样的新人。萧淑英说：“说实在的，这些成绩全是党的，要不是党，我们怎么知道土洋结合，怎么知道群众路线？”年纪这样轻的小姑娘之所以能够掌握太空中的风云变化，不只是一个科学知识问题，而首先是因为党的路线的正确，这正是这个小姑娘的形象显得比天空中的风雨更强有力的一个根本原因。掌握了自然规律的气象员萧淑英，站在玉山顶上，在闪电轰雷之中，看白茫茫的云海照着她的预测在脚下向东滚去，暴雨始终没有落到她们公社的土地上。在这一刹间，我们多么强烈地感觉到这个小姑娘比漫天呼啸的暴风雨更为有力。大批掌握科学知识的农民正在农村中涌现，千千万万的工农群众，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，正在向劳动者知识化的道路迈进。萧淑英正是在一定程度上表现了中国劳动人民理想的和现实的英雄形象。这两个例子，都说明了：描写个别先进人物，只有表现出他们是站在时代最前列，从时代变革中产生，而又是推动时代进一步向前发展的新生力量的代表，才能够显示出他们的生命力，才能够使艺术形象有更强的典型性。如果作家没有革命的理想，没有共产主义的世界观，就不可能看见新事物为什么有强大的生命力。
    李准同志对于新人物、新事物的描写的第二个特点，就是真实地从实际斗争中来表现出新事物、新人物的成长，从斗争中刻划人物的坚强性格，在斗争中赋予人物性格以鲜明的时代特色。新事物、新人物正是在同资本主义势力、保守、落后的习惯势力、同工作上的困难作斗争中而射出灿烂的光辉，显示出英雄人物崇高的精神世界。李双双充满了革命活力的性格，是在不断斗争中被鲜明地刻划出来的，开始是同她爱人小私有者习气的斗争，第二次是同富裕中农孙有和满脑袋自私思想的金樵的斗争，没有这些斗争，很难使李双双这个形象这样光采，像现在这样富有时代特点。萧淑英对党、对人民事业负责的英雄性格，是在她同气象预测中的困难作斗争中表现出来的。她的革命的坚定性，也是在她不为富裕中农和少数落后群众的嘲笑、怀疑所动摇中表现出来的。如果萧淑英掌握气象规律十分容易，萧淑英也就不是现在的萧淑英了。		二
    综观李准同志的小说，有一条总的发展线索贯穿着，这就是反映农村中的社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。在他的创作中，反映了农村阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性。李准同志不少作品中都准确地抓住了这一时期农村阶级斗争的动向，有力地揭露了资本主义势力的破坏活动，批判了农民中某些受资产阶级思想影响的人，给读者以正面的阶级教育。李准同志为我们画出的农村图画，是在斗争中步步前进的图画。用他自己的话来说，他的创作“都是沿着这么一条线来叙述故事和人物——那就是崭新的社会主义思想和腐朽的资本主义思想的斗争。”（《车轮的辙印》后记）
    李准同志作品中反映农村两条道路的斗争，大致分作两种类型。一种类型的批判锋芒是直接指向富农和某些坚持走资本主义道路的富裕中农的。作者善于彻底揭露资本主义势力的破坏手段，从斗争中表现战胜资本主义势力对建设社会主义农村的重大意义。在李准同志的作品中，我们可以看到这种阶级斗争在不同时期有其不同特点。《冰化雪消》揭露在合作化运动开始发展起来的时候，隐蔽的富农刘二兴用组织假合作社的方法来破坏合作化，腐蚀和欺骗了有严重资本主义思想的党员魏虎头，阴险地企图在合作社的外衣下来恢复剥削。《“三眼铳”掉口记》揭露了仇视统购统销的富裕中农裴四倍，挑拨了一个心直口快而思想有些糊涂的老贫农裴西河，替他“放炮”反对统购统销。而《李双双小传》中，李双双同富裕中农孙有的尖锐斗争，却集中到食堂问题上去了，因为办食堂是人民公社化之后一个极大的转变，是搞好集体生活的根本关键，因而坚持办好食堂就成了阶级斗争的焦点。在这些故事中，作者一方面歌颂了、描写了坚决同资本主义势力斗争的先进人物，一方面批判了立场动摇或思想模糊的落后人物，最后那些想望资本主义复辟的人物总是陷入完全的失败和孤立。对于那些反社会主义势力的代表，作者进行了尖锐的揭露和打击。
    另一种类型，是批判某些干部和农民当中的资本主义思想的。这些人自己并不是反社会主义分子，但具有较严重的资本主义思想，或者因为只顾个人眼前利益，而同合作化、人民公社化运动发生了矛盾。如《不能走那一条路》中想买地的宋老定，《一串钥匙》中还想依靠儿子、儿媳劳动偷懒享现成的白举封，《李双双小传》中同老婆发生剧烈的冲突的喜旺，都是这一类型的人。他们或者最后能够走上社会主义道路，或者经过批评、帮助能够克服自己在社会主义道路上的动摇；但在某些触及个人利益的问题上，却还保持着小私有者的心理和习惯，因此在社会主义集体事业发展过程中，便同他们那些旧思想旧习惯发生了矛盾。李准同志的作品中，广泛地触及了这一类人民内部矛盾。作品中对于这些人物的态度，同对待那些仇恨、破坏社会主义事业的阶级敌人不同。作者一面严肃地指出他们的缺点，一面又显示出他们能够在批评与自我批评中走向进步。这些人物的遭遇，不少是喜剧性的，他们落后的一面同现实发生了很不协调的矛盾，使他们在某一阶段陷入窘境，有过一些同广大群众的行动相抵触的行为，受到群众的反对和指责，但最后他们还是走到进步的道路上来，同时代的潮流趋向一致了。他们的错误思想受到了批判，但整个形象到最后给予我们的印象还是好的，并不像那些坏蛋一样，使读者对他们憎恶到底。如《一串钥匙》中的白举封，他头脑中还想靠“一家之主”的地位，把家庭经济大权独揽在自己手里，不让儿子媳妇有独立支配自己劳动所得的权利，以便靠别人劳动养活自己，这种思想受到了家庭成员的一致反对。当他经过家庭会议，“权力下放”之后，家庭关系并不是恶化，而是更加和睦。这些，就思想斗争的性质来说，还是社会主义思想和资本主义思想的斗争，这只能是一方战胜另一方，不能模糊；就人来说，却并不是因一方面胜利另一方面就垮台，而是通过“团结——批评——团结”的方式，曲折地带动他们走向进步。
    要领导好合作化、人民公社化运动，必须有坚强的领导干部。李准同志的小说中创造了不少优秀的领导干部的形象。他们坚定地执行党的阶级路线和各种政策，忠心耿耿地为党的事业奋斗，密切联系群众，同违反党的路线、政策的现象进行斗争。同歌颂这些优秀的基层领导干部并行的，作者也批判了有些干部思想作风上的毛病。《冰化雪消》中，生动地描写了三类领导干部：一类是以党支部书记兼红旗社社长的郑德明为代表的广大优秀的领导干部，他们身上正确地体现了党的领导。郑德明坚持了党的阶级路线，同富农的破坏行为、同个别党员投降资本主义势力的错误，进行了不调和的斗争。同时又坚持了团结，反对了像刘麦闹这样的干部的急躁情绪和自满情绪，最后团结了广大农民，彻底揭露了富农的阴谋。第二类，刘麦闹是坚决要走社会主义道路的，但缺少耐性，不善于用说服的方法处理先进同落后的矛盾，同别的小社的关系上又表现了自满情绪，结果影响了社与社之间的团结，被富农、富裕中农钻了空子。第三类干部是个别的，如虎头，有严重的资本主义思想，被富农的挑拨弄昏了头脑，看不见阶级敌人的破坏行为，放弃了社会主义阵地。作者热烈地歌颂了郑德明，尖锐地批判了丧失立场的虎头，也批评了麦闹的错误实际上是有利于阶级敌人而不利于社会主义的。当麦闹和红旗社的干部都端正了作风之后，广大农民群众就团结在党的周围，一小撮破坏分子就水落石出，彻底暴露。《耕云记》中在林书记、关书记、萧淑英身上体现出来的踏踏实实的党的工作作风，是有很大的现实意义的。他们把敢想、敢做、敢负责的革命气魄同深入的调查研究，紧紧结合在一起；把战略上藐视困难同战术上重视困难紧紧地结合在一起；把实验室里的资料同群众的智慧紧紧地结合在一起，因此就能掌握真实情况对症下药，取得了抗旱斗争的胜利。就是到了最后，根据充分的材料，断定了暴雨不会过山，可以暂不放水，也还是从两种可能性上准备了两手，组织了青壮年力量上堤守护，作最坏的打算。这就使自己的工作立于不败之地。小说一开始，作者就突出地刻划了关书记和萧淑英对于一切事情都回答得异常准确，什么时候刮风、下雨，多少亩田种了什么，下了几遍肥，都用精确的数字说明，没有任何含混不清的回答，给我们以非常强烈的印象。这种踏踏实实的劲头，正是毛主席多次教导我们的实事求是的工作作风，也就是林书记所概括的对一切问题都“有根据，有调查，有研究。”玉山人民公社的一切胜利，都同这种作风分不开的。这篇小说里用生动的艺术形象所表现出来的这种实事求是的工作作风，是值得大大提倡的。这篇小说较之李准同志以前这类作品，达到了较高的思想水平。
    在这里，我们可以看到努力学习毛主席著作和掌握毛泽东思想对于创作的极其重要的意义，可以看到在深入生活的基础上，作家的马克思列宁主义思想水平的逐渐提高，对创作发展的决定作用。就是在1957年上半年反右派斗争和全民整风的时候，李准同志在创作上也曾在一个短时期内受到了不好的影响，走过一小段弯路。如《芦花放白的时候》这篇作品，就明显地受到了所谓
  “揭露阴暗面”的谬论的影响，小说中看不到李准同志以前和以后的作品中所表现出来的那种蓬勃的新气象。这正是因为作者没有坚定地掌握毛泽东思想，所以一时迷了路。这虽然已经是过去的事了，但今天李准同志创作思想上和艺术上的新成就，同过去一小段弯路相对照，不正说明了世界观对创作的决定作用吗？只有不断地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，才能够正确地表现这个伟大时代的伟大斗争，我们只有用毛泽东思想作指针去认识现实、概括生活，才能使我们的创作不断地向更高的思想水平和艺术水平发展。		三
    李准同志的短篇小说，在艺术描写上也有明显的提高，主要表现在艺术概括性比过去加强了。
    艺术概括性的问题，就是作品中描写的生活如何来源于实际生活，但又比普通的实际生活更高、更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此也更带普遍性，能更有力地推动现实向前发展。艺术概括性越强，对读者的艺术感染力也就越大，读者也就越能够从艺术作品中强烈地感到整个时代的发展。无论过去和现在，总的说来，李准同志的作品都是来源于农村实际生活的，他没有脱离实际生活去臆造故事，他的作品中始终有浓厚的生活气息，对于农民的性格特点和生活习惯，李准同志是很熟悉的。朴朴实实的文风，生动的群众化的语言，描绘生活的语言同人物语言和谐地一致，是李准同志创作的一贯的特色。他的小说具有比较鲜明的民族风格。《李双双小传》、《耕云记》等作品，不但同样具有上面的艺术特色，而且对读者的艺术感染力比过去更大了。这是为什么呢？第一，艺术上比过去更加精炼，“去芜存菁”的加工做得更好了。过去有的作品，在内容上显得芜杂和冗长了些，现在的作品，在素材的处理上大多环绕着一个中心思想而展开，无关的就加以省略，因而显得更加集中。如《一串钥匙》、《三月里的春风》、《李双双小传》，都能够把艺术描写集中到主题思想的焦点上。第二，过去的作品，作者还偏重于从叙述故事来形成作品的结构，在描写人物的时候，比较注重从故事展开中表现人物性格的个性特点，而较少注意在人物的精神面貌上体现时代的风貌，最近一个时期的作品，不仅人物性格的描写更加鲜明，而且更加注意了从人物的精神面貌上体现整个时代的气氛。从先进人物的精神面貌上体现时代的特点，也更加注意从人物相互关系上体现新的人和人的关系，因此人物性格同整个作品的典型性都加强了。比较一下两篇小说：《林业委员》和《两代人》，篇幅都不长，一篇六千多字，一篇八千多字。两篇作品都是歌颂农村中的先进人物，前一篇是歌颂两个青年：一个是青年姑娘“小劳模”沈玉凤，一个是黄河农业社造林好手小伙子秀山；后一篇是歌颂农业社中的母女两代：母亲高秀贞是新任造酒厂的厂长，女儿珠珠是新任的妇联主任。但后一篇给读者的印象比前一篇强烈。为什么呢？在《林业委员》中，沈玉凤和秀山两个先进人物的形象也是明朗的、生动的，现实和理想也都是美丽的，在思想上也是健康的。这篇小说的故事就是沈玉凤到秀山社里去参观造林，在参观过程中，表现了沈玉凤的热情、虚心和秀山的活泼和钻劲。但是，从这两个很可爱的青年先进人物的形象上，除了他们本人的优秀品质以外，我们还不能强烈地感到合作化时期所引起的深刻变革；在沈玉凤和秀山的关系上，除了故事情节使他们发生联系外，也还缺少精心地从人物的关系上体现出整个农村新关系。《两代人》显然有了很大发展，虽然人物也只是两个，但高秀贞的精神面貌上却强烈地反映着大跃进、人民公社化时期整个农村生活巨大而迅速的变化，一接触到高秀贞兴奋的、充满活力的心情，我们立刻感到了大跃进的气息扑面而来。作者把人物性格同时代变化紧紧联系在一起，生动地、形象地描绘了人物的精神面貌，又从人物兴奋的、愉快的心情中反映了农村中巨大的变化。高秀贞老当益壮、干劲十足、奋发前进的性格，正是这个变得又快又好的跃进时代的一面镜子，而反过来，浓郁的时代色彩又使得高秀贞的心情富于感染力，使读者很容易受到感动，引起共鸣。《两代人》中安排高秀贞同珠珠的关系，不只是各自调动工作，而是把她们两个的工作写成衔接的关系，这就加深了作品的意义：两代人不只是年龄上的两代，也是事业上紧随前进的革命的两代。
    短篇小说在我国文学创作中是很繁荣的，特别是近几年来，呈现出百花齐放的景色，涌现出大批优秀的具有鲜明民族特色和时代特点的作品。李准同志的创作是其中的一枝花。读者们希望李准同志沿着《李双双小传》、《耕云记》的方向继续前进，为我们创作出更多更好的作品。李准同志在《车轮的辙印》一书后记中说：“从宋老定发家致富，要买土地开始，到人民公社化后，白举封把最后几把钥匙‘下放’给儿媳妇止，……我自己回顾一下，也觉得我们祖国的农村变化多么大啊！”是的，过去十一年的变化是伟大的变化，但更伟大的变化还在前头，更伟大的胜利还在前头，相信在李准同志今后的作品中，一定能够看到中国农村、中国农民更伟大的变化，看到社会主义、共产主义事业在中国土地上的更伟大的胜利！
