　　One Flag Raised, Ten Thousand Flags Fluttering
　　——The Liu’an Special District Launches a Wave of Learning from the High-Yield Wheat Experience of the Pidong Brigade

　　The Pidong Brigade of the Pidong Commune in Liu’an County, Anhui, created a complete set of wheat yield-increasing experiences centered on rational close planting, enabling the brigade’s 3,000 mu of contiguous wheat fields to achieve high yields year after year. This year, the average yield exceeded more than twice the average yield of the entire special district. This red flag of large-scale, high-yield wheat production has attracted production units in the Liu’an Special District, launching a wave of learning from and catching up with Pidong in this year’s autumn planting.

　　Only by Being a Good Student Can You Be a Good Teacher

　　On October 2, more than 180 people, including the first secretaries of the county committees and the secretaries of the commune party committees from the entire special district, went to the Pidong Brigade to learn from their experience.

　　After listening to Gui Jingyuan, the party branch secretary and wheat expert of the Pidong Brigade, introduce the experience of increasing wheat production, the secretaries came to the Nantans in the Zhanglou Production Team - six mu of deeply ploughed and leveled fields. Everyone gathered around Gui Jingyuan, first watching him demonstrate the sowing, and then dispersing to practice sowing by county.

　　The on-site operation began. Some people took out tape measures from their pockets to measure the size of the seedbeds and row spacing; some took out rulers to calculate the amount of seeds sown per square meter within the sowing width; some squatted in the middle of the furrow, using their fingers to count the wheat seeds, studying the degree of "sparse inside and dense outside"; and some picked up the row planter to count the number of seed-dropping holes. In order to learn the skill of using the row planter with even force in both arms and steady steps in both feet, many people followed behind Gui Jingyuan to practice their steps.

　　On the second day of the on-site meeting, the Shucheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a county committee meeting to study specific measures to promote Pidong's advanced sowing experience in light of local conditions. On October 9, more than 6,000 cadres above the level of production team leader from the entire county gathered in the Shafen Brigade of the Qianzhen Commune, where Shi Yuansheng, the first secretary of the county committee, taught Pidong's sowing experience. On this day, they made a total of 31 mu of demonstration fields and trained more than 2,000 row planters.

　　Overcoming Technical Hurdles

　　Sujiabu, where the Subu Commune in Liu’an County is located, and Muchangbu, where the Pidong Commune is located, stand side by side on the banks of the Pi River like two twin flowers; in wheat production, they are also two equally matched rivals. Since the Pidong Brigade raised the red flag of large-scale, high-yield wheat production in 1958, the Subu Commune has always been at the forefront of learning from and catching up with Pidong. During the autumn planting last year, they went to Pidong four times, learning everything about Pidong’s wheat planting and trying their best to follow every measure. This spring, the wheat seedlings in Subu Commune were lush and green, very strong, and Gui Jingyuan, secretary of the Pidong Brigade, was also surprised. However, in the later stage, some of the wheat seedlings in Subu fell over, and the average yield per mu was more than 100 jin less than that of Pidong. When summarizing the experience of wheat production, the secretary of the commune party committee said excitedly: "In terms of natural conditions, we are better than Pidong; in terms of effort, we are not worse than Pidong. The reason we didn't catch up with them is that we didn't overcome the technical hurdle."

　　On the first day the Pidong Brigade started to repair autumn planting tools, more than a dozen iron and wood workers from the Subu Commune, led by Fang Xiancun, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, went there to learn how to make row planters. After five days of learning, Secretary Fang and his partners learned all the skills to manufacture row planting tools. Immediately afterwards, more than 300 iron and wood workers from the entire commune were concentrated to rush to manufacture them. In one month, the entire commune improved and newly manufactured 2,600 row planters and ditch openers. With advanced tools, there must also be skilled operating techniques, and a large-scale military training was carried out tensely in every corner of the commune. On the day when the prefectural party committee held a field meeting in Pidong, more than 40 members of the Subu Commune also rushed to visit and study. Wu Guiquan, a 65-year-old member, did not make it that day. The next day, he walked 70 li to visit himself. The members are determined to overcome the technical hurdle and strive to catch up with Pidong in wheat production next year.

　　Pooling Efforts to Find Fertilizer Sources

　　The Yinghe Commune in Shouxian County has more land and fewer laborers. This year, each laborer in the entire commune has to plant an average of five mu of wheat. For the members of the Yinghe Commune, learning from Pidong in terms of processing and adding fertilizer is a difficult problem. However, they did not hesitate in the face of difficulties, but quickly caught up.

　　One night, Nie Zhongfan, the branch secretary of the Daying Production Team, said at a members' meeting: "Pidong's fertilizer piles are like small mountains, and our fertilizers are far too lacking! Everyone, come up with ideas." Everyone clamored: burning soil packages, shoveling sod, digging pond mud.... In this noisy crowd, the old farmer Shi Peigen blurted out: "I heard my father say when I was a child that the Xiaowa Dang in Zhuangxi used to be a manure pit, which was buried by soil in a year of heavy rain, and there must be good fertilizer below."

　　Shi Peigen said the words, but he doubted again: if there is no fertilizer, wouldn't the labor be in vain? A sense of responsibility drove away his sleepiness, and as soon as the meeting was over, he went to Xiaowa Dang to dig the manure cellar. The shovel danced for a while, but he didn't see any sign of fertilizer. The Dang was dug deeper and deeper, and Shi Peigen became more and more anxious. He dug half a person deep in one breath, and only when the dark, good fertilizer appeared in front of him did he look up at the setting moon and happily go home.

　　The next day, the production team dispatched 16 members to dig fertilizer in the Dang. A circle of people on the Dang, a circle of people in the Dang, one shovel after another, and large pieces of "black ingots" were turned from the Dang to the Dang surface. After one day, the Dang surface was like a small mountain, filled with piles of fertilizer, totaling 3,000 dan. In fact, this is just one example of the fertilizer accumulation movement in the Daying Production Team. From the branch secretary to the members, the entire production team formed several fertilizer accumulation combat teams, appearing in the fields and villages, cutting green grass, and dredging pond mud,....

　　The fertilizer problem was solved, and the problem of breaking the soil was like a "roadblock" blocking everyone from catching up with Pidong. It takes four or five workdays to break the soil for one mu of land. What should be done? The cadres and members of the Yinghe Commune felt that the only way to think was to be clever. Therefore, a movement to reform tools was launched. After several sleepless nights, everyone finally created a clever soil crushing machine. The entire commune quickly promoted this advanced tool, greatly increasing the efficiency of autumn planting, ensuring that the autumn planting seized the season and guaranteed the quality.

　　All Walks of Life Support

　　In the sound of the horn of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing food production, people in the city were also involved in the movement to learn from and catch up with Pidong.

　　One day before autumn planting, in the office of the Farm Implement Experimental Factory in Huoqiu County.

　　"Comrade Da Chun, autumn planting is about to begin, can we make so many row planters?"

　　"No problem, we guarantee to complete it." Zhang Da Chun, director of the Farm Implement Experimental Factory, accepted the task of imitating the Pidong-style wheat row planter after a moment of contemplation in front of Hao Lijun, secretary of the county party committee.

　　The task was accepted, but how to solve the problem of raw materials? The county will plant 1.2 million mu of wheat this year, requiring more than 9,000 row planters in total. Calculated at five row planters per square meter of tinplate, more than 1,800 square meters are needed. The problem is obvious, and to solve this contradiction, the wheat row planter must be reformed. Director Zhang didn’t know how many times he discussed it with the workers, but there was never any result.

　　One afternoon, he went into the city. On the road, he accidentally saw a person pushing a mill, inserting chopsticks into the mill eye. Strangely, as soon as the chopsticks were inserted, the grain that could not go down before fell down with a crash. The word "friction" immediately flashed through his mind. He hurried back to the factory, discussed with the workers, and tried to make it. After repeated trials, a tool that saves materials and has high efficiency was born.

　　When the workers beat gongs and drums and carried the new planter to report the good news to the county party committee, the county party committee was holding a meeting of commune party committee secretaries. Director Zhang started performing in the conference room: the planter walked across the floor again and again, and golden wheat grains fell neatly and evenly on the floor with his rhythmic steps. Everyone immediately gathered around, some measuring the sowing width with rulers, some calculating the number of seeds sown per mu, and some commenting enthusiastically on the uniformity of "sparse inside and dense outside"... The secretaries praised it.

### 一旗高举万旗飘——六安专区掀起学习淠东大队小麦高产经验的热潮

    一旗高举万旗飘
    ——六安专区掀起学习淠东大队小麦高产经验的热潮
    安徽六安县淠东公社淠东大队创造了以合理密植为中心的一整套小麦增产经验，使全大队三千亩连片小麦，年年获得高额丰产，今年平均产量超过全专区平均产量两倍以上。这一面小麦大面积高额丰产红旗吸引着六安专区各生产单位，在今年的秋播中开展了学、赶淠东的热潮。
    当好学生才能当好先生
    10月2日，全专区的县委第一书记和公社党委书记等一百八十多人，到淠东大队取经。
    各级书记听了淠东大队党总支书记、小麦土专家桂景元关于小麦增产经验的介绍以后，一齐来到张楼生产队南滩——六亩经过深翻、平整的田间。大家围着桂景元，先看他做播种的示范表演，然后分散开来，以县为单位实习播种。
    实习操作开始了，有的人从荷包里掏出了皮尺，量墒子、行距的尺寸；有的人拿出米达尺，计算播幅内每一平方米的下种量；有的蹲在墒沟中间，用手指点着一个个麦粒子，研究“里稀外稠”的程度；也有的拿起条播器，数点下种眼的孔数。为了学会两臂用力不轻不重，两脚迈步不快不慢的使用条播器的技巧，很多人跟在桂景元的后面练习步子。
    现场会议的第二天，中共舒城县委就召开了县委会议，研究了因地制宜地推广淠东先进播种经验的具体措施。10月9日，全县六千多个生产组长以上的干部，云集在乾镇公社沙坟大队，由县委第一书记史元生传授淠东的播种经验。这一天，他们一共做了三十一亩样子田，训练了二千多个条播手。
    攻克技术关
    六安县苏埠公社所在地的苏家埠和淠东公社所在地的木厂埠，像两朵并蒂的鲜花，并立在淠河两岸；在小麦生产上，他们也是两个互不相让的劲旅。自1958年淠东大队树起了小麦大面积高额丰产红旗以后，苏埠公社就一直成为学赶淠东的急先锋。去年秋种，他们曾四下淠东，种麦样样都学淠东，措施着着不让。今年开春，苏埠公社的麦苗一片葱绿，旺壮得很，淠东大队总支书记桂景元也感到吃惊。但是，到了后期，苏埠的一些麦苗倒伏了，平均每亩麦子比淠东少收一百多斤。公社党委书记在总结小麦生产经验的时候，激动地说：“论自然条件，我们比淠东好；论干劲也不比淠东差。没有赶上人家，就是技术关没有过好。”
    在淠东大队刚动手整修秋播工具的第一天，苏埠公社的十多个铁木工人，就由党委副书记方先存带着，到那里去学习制造条播器。经过五天的学习，方书记和他的伙伴学会了制造条播工具的全付本领。随后，立即把全社的三百多名铁木工人集中起来突击赶制。一个月，全社就改进和新制了二千六百部条播器和开沟器。有了先进工具，还要有熟练的操作技术，一场大练兵在公社的各个角落里紧张地进行着。地委在淠东召开现场会的那一天，苏埠公社有四十多个社员也赶去参观、学习。六十五岁的老社员吴贵权当天没有赶上，第二天，一个人走了七十里路，亲自走访一趟。社员们决心攻克技术关，争取明年小麦产量赶上淠东。
    群策群力找肥源
    寿县迎河公社土地多、劳力少，今年全社平均每个劳动力要种五亩麦子。对迎河公社的社员来说，学淠东那样加工加肥是个难题。可是，他们没有在困难面前踌躇，而是急起直追。
    一天夜晚，大郢生产队支书聂忠范，在社员大会上说：“淠东肥堆像小山一样，俺们的肥料差得太多啦！大家都来想想点子。”大家七嘴八舌嚷开了：烧土包子，铲草皮，挖塘泥……。在这闹哄哄的人群里，老庄稼头时培根冒了一句：“小时候听我爹说过，庄西小洼垱原来是个粪坑，有年发大水，被土埋没了，保险下面有好肥料。”
    时培根话说出口了，可他又怀疑起来：要是没有肥料，人工不是白搭吗？责任感驱走了他的睡意，一散会就去小洼垱扒粪窖。铁锹飞舞了好一会，连点肥料影子也没有看到。垱越挖越深，时培根也越来越焦虑。他一鼓作气挖了半人深，直到乌嘟嘟的好肥料出现在眼前时，才抬起头来，瞅瞅斜西的月亮，兴冲冲地回了家。
    第二天，生产队出动了十六个社员，到洼垱挖肥料。洼上一圈人，洼里一圈人，一锹接一锹，“黑元宝”大块大块地从洼里翻到洼面。一天以后，洼面上像小山似的，堆满了一垛垛肥料，足有三千担。其实，这不过是大郢生产队积肥运动中的一例。全生产队从支书到社员，组成了几支积肥战斗队，出没在田间、村庄，割青草、捞塘泥，……。
    肥料问题解决了，碎土问题又像一只“拦路虎”，挡住大家赶淠东。一亩地碎土要花四、五个工，怎么办呢？迎河公社的干部、社员觉得只有从巧字上想办法。于是，一个改革工具的运动展开了。大家熬过了几个不眠之夜，终于制出了一部灵巧的碎土机。全社迅速推广了这种先进工具，秋播工效大大提高。使秋种抢住了季节，保证了质量。
    各行各业来支援
    在大办农业、大办粮食的号角声中，城市里的人也卷入了这场学、赶淠东的运动。
    秋种前有一天，在霍丘县农具试验厂办公室里。
    “大纯同志，秋种快开始了，我们能制那么多的条播器吗？”
    “没有问题，保证完成。”农具试验厂厂长张大纯在县委书记郝利钧面前，经过了片刻的沉思，接受了仿制淠东式小麦条播器的任务。
    任务接受下来了，可原材料的问题怎么解决呢？全县今年种小麦一百二十万亩，共需条播器九千多部，以每平方米白铁皮可以制五部计算，就需要一千八百多平方米。问题很明显，要解决这个矛盾，就必须改革小麦条播器。张厂长不知和工人们研究了多少次，总是没有一个结果。
    一天下午，他进城去。路上偶然看到一个推磨的人在磨眼里插筷子。奇怪，筷子一插，原来下不去的谷子就哗哗地掉下去了。“摩擦力”这个词立刻掠过他的脑际。他连忙跑回工厂，找了工人一面讨论，一面试制。经过反复试制，一种节省材料、工效高的工具诞生了。
    工人们敲锣打鼓、抬着新式播种器向县委报喜的时候，县委正在召开公社党委书记会议。张厂长就在会议室里表演起来：播种器在楼板上走一趟又一趟，金色的麦粒随着他那有节奏的步子，整齐而又均匀地落在地板上。大家立刻围上来，有的拿着尺量播幅，有的计算每亩下种斤数，有的热烈地评论着“里稀外稠”的均匀程度……。书记们赞不绝口。
