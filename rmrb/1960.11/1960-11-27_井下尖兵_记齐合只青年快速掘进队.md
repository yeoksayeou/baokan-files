    Underground Vanguard
    —A Record of the Qi Hezhi Youth Rapid Tunneling Team
    The Qi Hezhi Youth Rapid Tunneling Team of the Chenjiazhuang Coal Mine under the Henan Province's Hebi Mining Bureau is a national coal mining tunneling pacesetter. In 1958, the Qi Hezhi Tunneling Team created new methods in drilling and slotting, which dramatically increased the daily tunneling progress from 2.4 meters to 14.5 meters. In 1959, they reached the record of tunneling 1,000 meters per month in coal lanes five times consecutively. The annual progress exceeded the 10,000-meter mark, completing two years' worth of work in one year. Starting from May this year, they have achieved new records of tunneling more than 2,000 meters per month in coal lanes for five consecutive months. From January to September, they completed a total of 17,600+ meters, which, according to the quota, is equivalent to three and a half years' worth of work, having already stepped into 1964 ahead of schedule.
    Qi Hezhi, a Communist Party member with lofty ideals, has led the youth tunneling team to continuously create and promote more than 20 new machines and tools, such as small belt conveyors, pillar cutting machines, and roof bolting machines, as well as dozens of new technologies such as deep-hole blasting and millisecond blasting, further accelerating tunneling efficiency. Currently, the team has been reduced from 96 people to 41, but the daily tunneling progress is advancing at a high speed of more than 70 meters or even 100 meters. The set of rapid tunneling experiences created by the Qi Hezhi Tunneling Team has opened up new avenues for the mechanization of roadway tunneling in our country, writing a glorious chapter in the history of coal mining.

    Firmly listening to the Party and relying on the Party's leadership is Qi Hezhi's true nature. Encouraged and supported by the Party, Qi Hezhi (first from the right) has created a new tunneling machine. Here, the mine's Party Secretary, Chen Puzhao (third from the right), and engineers are guiding and helping him study the design of the new machine's drawings.
    Every worker in the Qi Hezhi Tunneling Team strictly adheres to operating procedures, achieving safe and high production without accidents for two years and ten months. Here, Qi Hezhi (left) is checking the quality of roof bolting with the safety inspector to ensure safe production.
    The Qi Hezhi Tunneling Team is a strong and united collective. They are energetic and enthusiastic in production; they are united and friendly, and feel cheerful in life. Here, Qi Hezhi (fifth from the left) is chatting with his comrades during a work break.
    Learning from the advanced and always striving to be the best is Qi Hezhi's fine quality. He is enthusiastically learning the advanced experience of millisecond blasting from his apprentices—Li Jianbang (right), the captain of the tunneling team from the Jiaochang Mine, and Liu Changxiu (center).

    井下尖兵
    ——记齐合只青年快速掘进队
    河南省鹤壁矿务局陈家庄煤矿齐合只青年快速掘进队，是全国煤矿掘进标兵。1958年齐合只掘进队在打眼、掏槽方面创造了新方法，使掘进日进尺由二点四米猛升到十四点五米。1959年又连续五次达到月进旱采煤巷千米的纪录。全年进尺突破万米关，一年干了两年活。从今年5月开始，他们更连续五个月取得煤巷单孔月进两千米以上的新纪录，1至9月共完成进尺一万七千六百多米，按定额计算，等于做了三年半的活，已经提前跨进了1964年。
    具有远大理想的共产党员齐合只，今年以来，领导着青年掘进队连续创造和推广了小型皮带运输机、砍柱口机、架棚机等二十多种新机具，以及深孔爆破、毫秒爆破等数十种新技术，使掘进效率更快的提高。目前，全队已由九十六人减少到四十一人，每天的掘进进尺却正以七十多米甚至一百米的高速度前进。齐合只掘进队所创造的一套快速掘进经验，为我国巷道掘进机械化开拓出新的途径，在煤矿开采史上写下了光辉的篇章。（附图片）

    坚决听党的话，依靠党的领导，是齐合只的本色。齐合只（右一）在党的鼓励和支持下，又创造了一种新的掘进机械。这是矿党委书记陈朴照（右三）和工程师正在指导和帮助他研究新机械图纸的设计问题
    齐合只掘进队的工人，个个严守操作规程，做到两年零十个月安全高产无事故。这是齐合只（左）正和安全检查员一起检查搁棚质量，保证安全生产
    齐合只掘进队是一个坚强团结的集体。他们在生产中生龙活虎，干劲冲天；在生活中团结友爱，心情舒畅。这是齐合只（左五）正和他的战友们在劳动休息时欢谈
    见先进就学，永争上游，是齐合只的优良品德。他正在热心地向他的徒弟——教场矿掘进队队长李建邦（右）和刘长修（中）学习毫秒爆破的先进经验	　　　新华社记者　杨震河、张青云摄
