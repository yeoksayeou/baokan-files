Xinhua News Agency, November 28th – Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and Xie Juezai, President of the Supreme People's Court, held a banquet tonight to welcome the Cuban legal workers delegation led by Santiago Cuba, Procurator-General of the Supreme Court of Cuba.

　　Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng delivered a speech at the banquet, extending a warm welcome to the Cuban guests. He said that revolutionary law is a powerful weapon to punish the enemy, protect the people, and defend the fruits of revolutionary victory. He proposed that legal workers of the two countries better master this weapon, wage a resolute struggle against the sabotage and subversion activities of reactionaries at home and abroad, especially US imperialism, to defend the revolution, defend construction, and defend the happy life of the people.

　　In his speech at the banquet, Santiago Cuba, the head of the delegation, expressed his deep gratitude for the friendship of the Chinese people and the Chinese government. He said that the Cuban people have always been good friends of the Chinese people. After the Cuban people overthrew the rule of US imperialism, the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of China and Cuba have deepened even further.

　　This Cuban friend said that US imperialism is the enemy of the people all over the world. They insist that China has a bamboo curtain, but in fact, it is US imperialism itself that has set up a bamboo curtain to prevent the people of Latin America from contacting the Chinese people and preventing the people of Latin America from understanding the experience of the Chinese revolution. He emphasized that today the imperialist bamboo curtain has been broken in Cuba, and Cuba has established friendly political, economic, and cultural relations with the Chinese people and many socialist countries. This proves that as long as the people hold the power, imperialism can do nothing. Santiago Cuba said that the Cuban people are constantly under the threat of aggressive US imperialism. The task facing the Cuban people is arduous. But it has the support of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. He pointed out that we have repeatedly experienced the close care and support of the Chinese people, and we believe that this friendship will be strengthened day by day, especially as the struggles of countries like China, Cuba, and the Congo against US imperialism are strengthened, the friendship of the people will continue to be strengthened. All the people in the world who are fighting for liberation will find their greatest friends in China.

　　Among those present at the banquet tonight were Ma Xiwu, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, Huang Huoxing, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Geng Biao, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Wu Defeng, Zhang Zhiran, and Zhang Youyu, Vice Presidents of the China Political Science and Law Society.

    张鼎丞和谢觉哉举行宴会
    欢迎古巴法律工作者代表团
    据新华社28日讯　最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞、最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，今晚举行宴会，欢迎以古巴最高法院检察长圣地亚哥·古巴率领的古巴法律工作者代表团。
    张鼎丞检察长在宴会上讲话，向古巴客人们表示热烈欢迎。他说，革命的法律是惩罚敌人、保护人民、保卫革命胜利果实的有力武器。他提出让两国的法律工作者更好地掌握这个武器，同国内外的反动派、特别是美帝国主义的破坏和颠复活动作坚决的斗争，保卫革命，保卫建设，保卫人民的幸福生活。
    圣地亚哥·古巴团长在宴会上对中国人民和中国政府的友谊，表示深切的感谢。他说，古巴人民一直是中国人民的好朋友。在古巴人民推翻了美帝国主义统治以后，更加深了中古两国人民的友谊和相互了解。
    这位古巴朋友说，美帝国主义是全世界人民的敌人。他们硬说中国有竹幕，实际上正是美帝国主义自己设下了竹幕，阻挠拉丁美洲人民同中国人民接触，阻挠拉丁美洲人民了解中国革命的经验。他强调说，今天帝国主义的竹幕在古巴已被打破了，古巴已经同中国人民及许多社会主义国家建立了政治、经济和文化等友好关系。这证明，只要人民掌握了政权，帝国主义就是无所作为的。圣地亚哥·古巴团长说，古巴人民时时刻刻处在富有侵略性的美帝国主义的威胁之中。古巴人民面临的任务是艰巨的。但是它得到了中国人民及全世界一切爱好和平人民的支持。他指出，我们一再体会到中国人民的亲切关怀和支持，我们相信这种友谊是会日益加强的，特别是随着像中国、古巴、刚果这样一些国家反对美帝国主义斗争的加强，人民的友谊是会不断加强的。世界上一切为争取解放的人民，都会在中国这里找到他们最伟大的朋友。
    出席今晚宴会的有最高人民法院副院长马锡五，最高人民检察院副检察长黄火星，外交部副部长耿飚，中国政治法律学会副会长吴德峰、张志让、张友渔等。
