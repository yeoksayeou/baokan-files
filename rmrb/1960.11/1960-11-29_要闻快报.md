	Baotou Iron and Steel Company recently adjusted the collective dormitories for employees according to the distribution of production and construction units, and transferred capable cadres to strengthen dormitory management. Leaders at all levels also frequently go deep into the dormitories and canteens to help arrange the lives of employees.

	Three Shifts Collaborate and Exchange Information
	Workers at the No. 3 open hearth furnace of the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company in Shanxi Province, in order to shorten smelting time and improve the steel's pass rate, established a system of exchanging information between the three shift leaders, understanding each other, and learning from each other's new experiences and technologies. When implementing this system, the furnace chief uniformly organized the three shifts of workers to summarize, coordinate, and then promote. As a result of the three-shift collaboration, the average smelting time per furnace of steel in September was shortened by 1.54 minutes compared to August, and shortened by another 39 minutes in October compared to September.

	The commercial and transportation departments of Anshun City, Guizhou Province, vigorously promoted incidental transportation, transporting a large number of agricultural and sideline products. In order to better utilize transportation equipment, they widely established incidental transportation stations along the city's highways. After a large number of agricultural and sideline products were incidentally transported by short-distance transportation tools to collection and transfer stations, they immediately took advantage of vehicles being empty or having insufficient tonnage to load and incidentally transport them. The city has already achieved timely transfer of fresh agricultural and sideline products, without backlog.
