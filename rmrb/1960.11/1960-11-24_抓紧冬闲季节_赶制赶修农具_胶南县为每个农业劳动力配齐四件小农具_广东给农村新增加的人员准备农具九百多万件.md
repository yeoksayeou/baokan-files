　　Seize the Slack Winter Season to Rush-Make and Repair Farm Tools
　　Jiaonan County Equips Each Agricultural Laborer with Four Small Farm Tools
　　Guangdong Prepares Over Nine Million Farm Tools for Newly Added Personnel in Rural Areas

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Shandong Province's Jiaonan County is seizing the current slack winter season, actively organizing county and commune industries, and vigorously rushing to produce and repair major small farm tools such as hoes, sickles, spades, and mattocks, striving to equip all agricultural laborers in the county with the four major items of hoes, sickles, spades, and mattocks this winter.

　　In order to conduct the production and repair of small farm tools in a planned and organized manner, the Jiaonan County Party Committee conducted investigations and assessments of the situation of the four major small farm tools—hoes, sickles, spades, and mattocks—in production teams of different types, such as mountainous, hilly, and plain areas. According to the information gathered, based on each laborer being equipped with one hoe, one sickle, one spade, and one mattock, the county needs a total of 720,000 hoes, sickles, spades, and mattocks. However, the county currently has only over 500,000 hoes, sickles, spades, and mattocks that can be used, with a shortage of over 200,000 pieces. In order to equip each agricultural laborer in the county with the four major items of hoes, sickles, spades, and mattocks, the County Party Committee first made comprehensive arrangements for the production and repair of small farm tools, planning to newly manufacture over 190,000 small farm tools this winter.

　　In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, the county organized industrial, commercial, and material supply departments to further tap the potential of raw materials from all aspects. Currently, 150 tons of various types of steel and 180 cubic meters of various types of wood have been mined, ensuring the smooth progress of the manufacture and repair of small farm tools.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd: Various areas in Guangdong Province have rushed to repair and manufacture a large number of small farm tools for newly added laborers in rural areas. As of the beginning of November, the province has produced 9,010,000 iron small farm tools.

　　Under the new situation of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, over 1.4 million laborers across the province have returned to the front line of agricultural production, greatly increasing the demand for farm tools. Therefore, various areas have launched a high tide of small farm tool production since September. County and commune farm tool and agricultural machinery factories, and brigade farm tool repair stations (groups) have concentrated their efforts on rushing to produce small farm tools such as hoes and sickles, while other relevant factories and commercial departments have also strongly supported them. In more than a month, the Shantou Special District rushed to produce 150,000 hoes.

　　While manufacturing a large number of small farm tools, various areas have also carried out the maintenance of small farm tools. The 1,200+ farm tool repair groups in Taishan County repaired and equipped various small farm tools for each team, totaling over 138,000 pieces, accounting for 96.4% of the number of small farm tools that should be repaired, before the autumn harvest.

    抓紧冬闲季节　赶制赶修农具
    胶南县为每个农业劳动力配齐四件小农具
    广东给农村新增加的人员准备农具九百多万件
    本报讯　山东省胶南县抓紧当前冬闲季节，积极组织县、社工业，大力赶制和修补锄、镰、锨、镢等主要小农具，力争今冬为全县所有的农业劳力每人配齐锄、镰、锨、镢四大件。
    为了使小农具的生产和修补工作有计划有组织地进行，中共胶南县委曾深入到山地、丘陵、平原等不同类型的生产队，就锄、镰、锨、镢四件主要小农具的情况，进行了调查和摸底。从掌握的情况来看，按每个劳力备齐锄、镰、锨、镢各一件计算，全县共计需要锄、镰、锨、镢七十二万件。而现在全县实际能够使用的锄、镰、锨、镢只有五十多万件，尚缺少二十多万件。为了给全县每个农业劳力备齐锄、镰、锨、镢四大件，县委首先对小农具生产和修补作了全面安排，计划在今年冬季新制小农具十九万多件。
    为了解决原材料不足的困难，又组织县工业、商业和物资供应等部门，从各方面进一步挖掘了原材物料的潜力。目前已挖掘出各种钢材一百五十吨，各种木材一百八十立方米，从而保证了小农具的制造和修补工作的顺利进行。
    据新华社广州23日电　广东各地为农村新增加的劳动力突击修制了大量小农具，到11月上旬，全省已生产了铁制小农具九百零一万件。
    在大办农业、大办粮食的新形势下，全省回到农业生产第一线的劳力达一百四十多万，对农具的需要量大大增加，因此，各地从9月起掀起了生产小农具的高潮。县和公社的农具、农械厂，大队的农具修配站（组）都集中力量突击生产锄头、镰刀等小农具，其他有关工厂和商业部门也大力支援。汕头专区在一个多月内，便突击生产了十五万把锄头。
    各地在大制小农具的同时，还开展小农具的维修工作。台山县的一千二百多个农具修理组，到秋收前即为各个小队修配了各种小农具十三万八千多件，占应修小农具数量的96.4％。
