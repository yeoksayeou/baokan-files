    The Yimen Mess Hall is Well-Run
    Ji Xijian, First Secretary of the Wuxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shanxi Province
  　Zhao Rixin, County Head of Wuxiang County
    Wuxiang County suffered a severe disaster this year, and the grain retention standard is relatively low. With less grain, can we eat well? There were many discussions. Most people acknowledged the difficulty, but believed that as long as we think of more ways, we can overcome the difficulties, run the mess hall well, and ensure that commune members eat their fill and eat well. The Yimen Mess Hall in Yongquan Commune is such a good mess hall.
    Yimen is a village of ninety-three households, which used to be very poor. In the past two years, they have turned things around and have surplus grain. In order to save and prepare for famine, the commune members have kept reserves, but the grain retained each year is not much. This year, due to the disaster, even less grain was retained. As a result, they have three meals a day, and everyone eats their fill and eats well. The following is the food situation in their mess hall for the past twenty days: out of sixty meals in twenty days, there was one meal of steamed buns, two meals of jujube cakes, two meals of yellow steamed buns, ten meals of corn bread, ten meals of soft rice and jujube sweet rice, five meals of braised noodles, and the rest were either noodle soup or mixed rice. Because everyone in this mess hall pays attention to saving, for several years, not only have they eaten their fill and eaten well, but every commune member's family has surplus grain. The entire management area has more than 30,000 jin of reserve grain, enough to get through a famine year.
    The main reasons why this mess hall is run well are fourfold: first, they have a good vision; second, they have a good group of managers; third, they have a good set of rules; and fourth, they have a solid foundation. Party Branch Secretary Li Guozhong said: "This is our complete set of skills. We rely on this to use less grain, eat our fill, and eat well."
    Having a Good Vision
    Having a good vision means seeing far and seeing clearly, and explaining things clearly to the commune members. Seeing far means starting from the long-term, looking from the beginning of the year to the end of the year; second, it means prioritizing prevention and keeping reserves. Seeing clearly means knowing exactly how much grain there is, how many vegetables there are, how many people there are, when to eat what, and how much to eat. Then, this information is conveyed to the commune members so that everyone is aware of it. This way, grain is saved and things are easier to manage. After the masses have discussed the annual income distribution, they formulate "Knowing Life a Year in Advance." Retain ten tenths, eat eight tenths, and use the grain for twelve months for thirteen months. Branch Secretary Li Guozhong said: "This arrangement is tighter now, but it will be much better in the future. For a year's life, everything is well-organized. What food to eat in what season, what is the main dish, what is the side dish, this mess hall plans everything clearly and arranges it carefully and reasonably. For example, in winter, the weather is cold and the work is not heavy, so the diet is mainly corn and naked oats, supplemented by pumpkins and wild vegetables. Corn and naked oats can be mixed more to make good fried noodles; pumpkins and wild vegetables cannot be stored for long, and if they are not eaten in winter, they will spoil. In summer, the weather is hot, the work is heavy, and people are prone to get heated, so they eat more millet, small beans, mung beans, and spring vegetables. In addition, improving life during the New Year and holidays, eating noodles and fine vegetables, is also planned in advance." When asked why he can figure things out so clearly, Li Guozhong said: "First, summarize experience, and second, consult with the masses."
    When the mess hall was first established in early 1958, the cadres' "eyes" were not so good. The grain was collected and put into the mess hall, allowing the commune members to eat as much as they wanted. At first, everyone was satisfied with eating their fill and eating well. After a few months, the grain became less, and the commune members had opinions, and the cadres' work was also very passive. From then on, when arranging life each year, they always handed over the family assets to the commune members, explained to the masses why they were doing it this way and not that way, absorbed everyone's opinions, formulated "Knowing Life a Year in Advance," and asked everyone to deliberate and discuss it. At first, some people still had doubts, but after discussion, everyone was united as one, and things became easier to manage. The commune members all understood the need to "save for famine and make the water flow slowly." People plan for the whole and also plan for themselves. The mess hall has a large plan, and individuals have small plans. Small plans guarantee the realization of the large plan. In this way, the plan for saving water for a long time and retaining reserves has become the action of the masses.
    Having a Good Group of Managers
    The Yimen Mess Hall is well-run also because the personnel are well-matched. Branch Secretary Li Guozhong has three bases: one is the office, one is the farmland, and the other is the mess hall. Whether it's day or night, as soon as he has nothing to do, he is with the cooks, stoking the fire, cutting vegetables, carrying water, and rolling noodles, doing whatever needs to be done. He is very considerate, serving bowls of food to the elderly; when there is not enough food at the end, he starts cooking for the cooks, but he himself does not eat a single extra grain of rice or drink an extra mouthful of soup. The commune members said: "Our branch secretary is so kind to us, he only knows about others, not about himself." The cooks said: "He is truly a fair person who cannot be found even if you search far and wide." There is also a good administrator here, named Ren Changda, who is a branch committee member and also a grain keeper. He doesn't talk much, "he doesn't get anxious even if the oil pan overflows," but his mind is the clearest, and he is a true calculating machine. You can ask him to endure any hardship or put in any effort, and he won't say a word; but if you lose a grain of grain, he won't let it go. A jin is a jin, and a liang is a liang, with no ambiguity. When others are eating, he wanders around the dining hall, and if anyone drops a grain of rice, he will pick it up and give you a look. There are also four cooks, all of whom are poor peasants with unwavering loyalty. The commune members praised them, saying: Zhang Meimei is fair-minded, Dong Runxiang is loyal and reliable, Zhang Gengxiu is efficient, and Hao Lanlan is hardworking. In the past, there was a Duan Zhuanying, who was a rich peasant, who used flowery words and did not work hard, and was rejected by everyone. Now these four people don't use flowery words, they just have a drive. They do what the commune members say is right with all their heart, and never complain no matter how tired they are. It is this group of people who are in sync from top to bottom, putting on a good show.
    Having a Good Set of Rules
    Good people also need a good system. This mess hall has three major systems: one is called democratic management, where the mess hall is run by everyone; one is called daily clearing and monthly settlement, with regular publication of accounts; and the third is "rationing by person, cooking according to the number of people, eating with tickets, and returning savings to oneself."
    The mess hall has a life management committee, composed of eleven members including the branch secretary, director, production team leader, cook, and commune member representatives. They meet once every seven days to discuss the opinions of the commune members and study the meals for the next stage. They are often with the commune members, collecting opinions, studying and handling them, and then conveying them. They are a bridge between the mess hall and the commune members. The mess hall also has a forum and suggestion box where everyone can criticize, praise, and make reasonable suggestions. The mess hall's meal tickets, grain tickets, how much grain is brought in, how much money is spent, how many vegetables are eaten, and all expenses are cleared daily, summarized monthly, and posted for everyone to discuss. Usually, when cooking, the amount is determined by the number of people, and food is cooked according to the number of people. People report when they come, and cancel when they leave, eating neither more nor less. At the end of the month, the surplus is returned to oneself, giving money to those who want money, giving grain to those who want grain, and giving grain tickets to those who want grain tickets. Everyone strongly supports such strict implementation of the system.
    The mess hall has been built for more than two years, and has eaten everything, but has never eaten fried noodles. A commune member raised this opinion, and the next morning, they ate fried noodles. Guozhong said: "Don't underestimate this small opinion, it involves the big issue of democratic management." This is indeed the case, because they seriously dealt with the opinions of the commune members, and more and more people actively participated in running the mess hall. A recent survey showed that the commune members had made more than 270 opinions and suggestions. Some suggested planting vegetables, some suggested making starch, and more suggested ways to combine staple and non-staple foods and eat their fill and eat well. Every day, there are always two or three old ladies helping out in the mess hall. When they are asked to leave, they don't leave; when they are asked to rest, they don't rest either. They say they won't feel at ease if they don't do something for the mess hall. As for those who take the time to clean, carry water, and feed pigs for the mess hall, there are even more of them. The administrator said: "In the past, when running the mess hall, I was the only one who was concerned, but now, everyone is concerned about running the mess hall."
    Having a Solid Foundation
    The Yimen Mess Hall is well-run because it vigorously engages in household production and strengthens the material foundation. Every winter, the commune members plant a large number of potted vegetables. These potted vegetables are not in iron pots or porcelain pots, but are woven from grass. They are placed at home in winter and buried in the ground in spring. As soon as the soil thaws in spring, green vegetables are planted again. As for the autumn and summer seasons, there are even more vegetables, including pumpkins, cowpeas, red and white radishes, and kohlrabi. This year, they harvested more than 280,000 jin of fresh vegetables, more than 1,000 jin per commune member. In addition to fresh vegetables, the commune members also dry a lot of dried vegetables; in addition to home-grown vegetables, there are also wild vegetables. The commune members bring baskets to the fields and pick up vegetables as soon as they see them. They hand in the vegetables and are paid in cash. In this way, they have recovered 12,000 jin of wild vegetables. In addition, the mess hall also has a flour mill, a vinegar mill, and a pig farm. This year, they used corn husks, corn cobs, yam vines, wheat straw, wild grass, and leaves to process more than 10,000 jin of starch. Starch can be mixed with grain to make many foods. Recently, in conjunction with the "three autumns" work, the entire management area has accumulated a large amount of starch raw materials.
    With long-term planning, capable people, a good system, and a solid material foundation, many new tricks that people never thought of have emerged. Vegetable dumplings, vegetable cornbread, vegetable steamed buns, vegetable noodles, vegetable buns, vegetable pancakes, ..., whatever grain can be made into, can also be made into with vegetables, which is both delicious and nutritious. The cooks' slogan is: "Make fine use of coarse grains and eat coarse vegetables delicately," and the commune members praise them as "miracle healers."

    义门食堂办得好
    中共山西省武乡县委第一书记　籍希俭
  　武乡县县长　赵日新
    武乡县今年灾情严重，留粮标准较低。口粮少，能不能吃得好？议论纷纷。大多数人承认有困难，但是只要多想办法，就能够克服困难，办好食堂，使社员吃饱吃好。涌泉公社的义门食堂，就是这样的好食堂。
    义门是一个九十三户人家的村子，过去很穷，这两年翻了身，有了余粮。社员们为了节约备荒，留有后备，每年留的口粮并不多。今年遭灾，留粮更少，结果是一天三顿，人人都吃得饱吃得好。下面是他们最近二十天的饭食情况：二十天的六十顿饭中，有一顿蒸馍，两顿枣糕，两顿黄蒸，十顿窝头，十顿软米枣儿甜饭，五顿闷面，其余不是片儿汤，就是和合饭。这个食堂由于人人都注意节约，几年来，吃饱吃好不算，社员家家有余粮，全管理区共有三万多斤储备粮，足够渡过一个灾荒年。
    这个食堂办得好的主要原因有四个：一是有一双好眼睛；二是有一批好管家；三是有一套好制度；四是有雄厚的家底。党支部书记李国忠说：“这就是俺们的全般武艺，就靠这，做到了用粮少，吃得饱，吃得好。”
    有一双好眼睛
    有一双好眼睛，就是看得远，看得清，给社员交代得明白。看得远，一是从长远出发，站在年初，看到年底；二是防字当头，留有后备。看得清，就是有多少粮，有多少菜，有多少人，什么时候吃什么，吃多少，都计算得清清楚楚，毫不含糊。然后把这个底交代给社员，让大家掌握。这样，省了粮食，事情还好办。经过群众讨论每年收益分配后，就订出“生活一年早知道”。留十成，吃八成，十二个月的粮食十三个月吃。支部书记李国忠说：“这样安排，现在紧些，将来就好得多。一年生活，有板有眼，什么季节吃什么饭，什么为主，什么为辅，这个食堂都打算得条条有道，安排得细，还很合理。比如，冬季天冷，活不重，吃食以玉米、莜麦为主，南瓜、野菜相随。玉米、莜麦能够多掺搅，做成好炒面；南瓜、野菜放不长久，冬天不吃就要坏。夏天天气热，活儿重，人肯上火，就多吃小米、小豆、绿豆、春菜。此外，过年过节，改善生活，要吃面吃细菜，也都早有打点。”问他为什么能摸得这么清楚，李国忠说：“一是总结经验，二是跟群众商量。”
    1958年初办食堂时，干部的“眼睛”并不那么好使，粮食收起来，朝食堂一放，由社员尽性吃。开先，吃得饱，吃得好，大家满意。几个月后，粮食少了，社员有意见，干部工作也很被动。从那时起，他们每年安排生活的时候，总是把家底交给社员，给群众讲清楚，为什么这么办，不那么办，吸收大家意见，订出“生活一年早知道”，交给大家酝酿讨论。开先还有些人言三语四，一讨论，千根线拧成了一股绳，事情就好办了。社员们都懂得要“节约备荒，细水长流”。人们为整体打算，也为个人打算，食堂有大计划，个人有小计划，小计划保证了大计划的实现。这么一来，细水长流，留有后备的用粮计划就变成了群众的行动。
    有一批好管家
    义门食堂办得好，还因为人手配搭得好。支部书记李国忠有三个据点，一个是办公室，一个是庄稼地，另外一个就是食堂。不论白天、黑夜，一没事就和炊事员在一块，烧火、切菜、担水、擀面，遇着什么干什么。他很会体贴人，开了饭，一碗一碗给老人端；最后饭不够，又下手给炊事员们做，本人却是米不多吃一颗，汤不多喝一口。社员们说：“俺支书和俺们可亲哩，就知道别人，不知道自己。”炊事员们说：他可真是百里挑一也挑不出来的公道人。这里还有一个好事务长，名叫任长大，是支部委员，又是粮食保管员。他不多说话，“溢了油锅也着不了急”，可是头脑最清楚，是一架真正的铁算盘。你让他吃多大苦，出多大力，二话不说；你要丢了颗粮食，那可不依。斤是斤，两是两，没半点含糊。别人吃饭，他在饭厅串，谁丢了饭粒，他就给拾起来，看你两眼。还有四个炊事员，都是赤胆忠心的贫农。社员们称赞他们说：张梅梅为人公道，董润香忠实可靠，张更秀办事利落，郝兰兰吃苦耐劳。以前，有一个段转英，是个富农，花言巧语不实干，被大家推掉。现在这四个人，不会花言巧语，就是有一股干劲。社员说对的，一心去办，受多大累从不叫苦。就是这么一伙人，上上下下合了拍，唱出了一台好戏。
    有一套好制度
    人好还得制度好，这个食堂大制度有三条：一叫民主管理，大家的食堂大家办；一叫日清月结，定期公布账目；还有一条“以人定量，按人做饭，凭票就食，节约归己”。
    食堂有一个生活管理委员会，由支部书记、主任、生产队长、炊事员、社员代表等十一个委员组成。他们七天开会一次，讨论社员意见，研究下阶段伙食。他们经常和社员在一起，把意见集中起来，研究处理，再传达下去，他们是食堂和社员中间的一座桥。食堂还有鸣放台，意见箱，大家可以批评、表扬，也可以提合理化建议。食堂的饭票、粮票，进多少粮，出多少钱，吃多少菜，一切开销，日日清算，月月总结，出榜公布，让大家讨论。平时做饭，以人定量，按人做饭，来人报，去人销，不多吃也不少吃。月终结余，节约归己，想领钱给钱，想领粮给粮，想要粮票给粮票。大家对这样严格执行制度非常拥护。
    食堂建起二年多，啥也吃过，就是没吃顿炒面。一个社员把这意见提上去，第二天一早，就吃到了炒面。国忠说：“你别看这意见小，却牵涉到民主管理的大问题。”确实如此，因为他们认真处理了社员意见，积极参加办食堂的人越来越多，最近统计过一次，社员提的意见和建议，就有二百七十多条。有提议种菜的，有提议做淀粉的，更多的是提出主食副食搭配、吃饱吃好的办法。每天食堂里断不了有两三个帮忙的老太婆，让她们走，她们不走；让她们歇，她们也不歇，她们说不给食堂办点事就不安心。至于抽时间给食堂打扫的、担水的、喂猪的，那就更多。事务长说：“过去办食堂，操心的就我一个人，如今办食堂，大家都操心。”
    有雄厚的家底
    义门食堂办得好，还在于大闹家底生产，加强了物质基础。每年冬天，社员们都大量种盆菜。这盆菜不用铁盆，也不用瓷盆，是用草草条条编成，冬天放在家里，开春埋到地里。春天土一解冻，马上又种青菜。至于秋夏两季，菜就更多，有南北瓜，有豆角，有红白萝卜，有蔓菁白菜。今年就收鲜菜二十八万多斤，每个社员有一千多斤。除了鲜菜，社员们还大晒干菜；除了家菜，还有野菜。社员们上地带筐，见菜就拔，回来交菜，付给现款，光这样收回来的野菜，就有一万二千斤。另外，食堂里还有一座粉坊，一座醋坊，一个猪场。今年就用玉米皮、玉米轴、山药蔓、麦秸和野草、树叶等加工淀粉一万余斤，淀粉掺粮可以做很多食品。最近，结合“三秋”工作，全管理区又积存了大批淀粉原料。
    有了长远的打算，有了能干的人，有了很好的制度，加上雄厚的物质基础，就出了许多人想也想不到的新花样。菜团子、菜窝窝、菜黄蒸、菜面条，还有菜包子、菜烙饼，……，粮食能做什么，加上菜就也能做成什么，既好吃，又营养。炊事员们的口号是：“粗粮细作，粗菜细吃”，社员们夸他们是“妙手回春”。
