    Evergreen
    Liu Lanshan
    Evergreen, also known as "Millennium Herb," is a perennial evergreen herb. In Chinese folk customs, when engagements are made, it is customary to give each other evergreen plants to symbolize eternal friendship and everlasting youth. On the occasion of the 43rd anniversary of the October Revolution, recalling what I saw during my visit to the Sino-Soviet Friendship People's Commune in Shijingshan, Beijing, my thoughts travel far and wide, and I write this as a congratulation. On the main road of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Commune, I saw clusters of lush evergreens, their green broad leaves rooted in the soil, facing the sun and the vigorous east wind. Gazing at these clusters of evergreens, my heart is like a lark on the grasslands – carrying the respect and gratitude of our commune, you soar across the Sino-Soviet border filled with pastoral songs; fly over Siberia, inhabited by land reclamation teams, and stop in Georgia, fragrant with tea; pass factories and farms like colorful clouds, and meet Gaganova – the Soviet weaving star. In that place where the fiery light reaches the sky, you sing songs of admiration. Oh, the sea of Communist labor brigades, advancing towards the paradise of communism! In the red-light-flashing Moscow, you pay repeated tribute to Lenin Hills, offering fraternal blessings and deep affection to the Kremlin and Red Square. Along the road illuminated by the October Red Star, in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America, you see how many people are marching on this great road! With unparalleled joy, you fly back to the sky of our beloved motherland; all the way, you keep looking back north, gazing at the radiant Red Star. Under the three red flags raised everywhere, you descend again into the jubilant commune forest: gazing at the evergreen leaves that never wither, singing loudly of the eternal friendship between the great Chinese and Soviet peoples!

    万年青

    万年青又名千年蒕，多年生常绿草本，我国民间旧俗订亲结好时，互赠栽植，以示永结友好，万古长青。兹值十月革命四十三周年纪念之际，忆及访问北京市石景山中苏友好人民公社所见，神驰遐迩，成此以为祝贺。在中苏友好公社的大路上，我看见一簇簇蓬蓬的万年青，绿色的阔叶子，根埋在土里，面向着太阳和勃勃的东风。望着望着这一簇簇万年青，我的心仿佛草原上的百灵——你带着我们公社的敬爱和感激，驰过牧歌声声的中苏国境；飞过住满垦荒队员的西伯利亚，在遍地茶香的格鲁吉亚停一停；路过彩云一样的工厂和农庄，会见了加干诺娃——苏联织女
    星；在那火光高接云天的地方，你唱出了敬佩的歌声；哦，云海一样的共产主义劳动队，正在向着共产主义乐园进军！在红光闪闪的莫斯科，你再三地对列宁山致敬，向着克里姆林和红场，你献出了兄弟的祝福和深情。沿着十月红星照耀的大路，在亚洲、非洲、欧洲、拉丁美洲，你看见多少人在这大路上行进！你怀着无比巨大的欢乐，重新飞回亲爱祖国的天空；你一路上不断地回头北望，望着那光芒四射的红星。在遍地高举的三面红旗下，你又降落到欢腾的公社树林中：凝视着这永远不雕的万年青绿
  叶，高歌伟大中苏人民友谊万古长
  青！
