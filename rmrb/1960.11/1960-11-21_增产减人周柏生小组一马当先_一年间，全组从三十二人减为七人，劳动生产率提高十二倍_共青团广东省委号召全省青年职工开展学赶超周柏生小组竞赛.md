Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Telegram: The Zhou Baisheng Group (Iron Core Group) of the Electric Motor Workshop of the Sanbu Power Plant in Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, was reduced from thirty-two to seven people in one year. The production plan was overfulfilled every month, and the entire year's production plan for this year was completed four months ahead of schedule. Labor productivity increased twelvefold, and the finished product rate increased to 98%. Since May of this year, the group has basically not received raw materials, using waste and scrap materials for production, saving the country six tons of silicon steel sheets in the third quarter alone.

The Zhou Baisheng Group's ability to increase production while reducing manpower is mainly due to their strong ambition to change the "poor and blank" face of the nation and accelerate socialist construction. When this group was established in August 1958, it had only three hand shears, three compasses, and two old and small hand-cranked punch presses. None of the thirty-two members of the group understood motor manufacturing technology, and more than 90% were apprentices (of which 80% were new apprentices). When initially manufacturing electric motors, the product quality was poor due to all manual operations. At that time, there was a debate about whether to "start the project" or "abandon the project." Those who advocated "abandoning the project" believed that "without a five-ton punch press, don't even think about manufacturing electric motors." However, these young people were not intimidated by the difficulties. They said, "We can use indigenous methods to make electric motors, and we can certainly meet the quality standards." Under the leadership of the Party branch, they used waste materials to make ten "indigenous" or simple machines such as universal shears, various punch presses, and guillotine shears, mechanizing 89% of the operations and producing high-quality motors and generators. Another method for the group to achieve increased production with reduced manpower is that everyone is proficient in one specialty and capable in many others, implementing comprehensive utilization of labor. They learn from the capable, divide the work and provide guidance, use the workshop as a classroom, and equipment as teaching materials, constantly conducting technical learning and continuously improving their technical level. After two years of production practice, innovation, and learning, all seven existing workers in the group have become versatile technicians. They can handle the twenty-three procedures of producing motor iron cores, both large and small, with ease.

Due to the improvement of mechanization and the technical level of the workers, the group's production outlook has fundamentally changed. In the past, the group of thirty-two people still felt insufficient in labor. When there were more production tasks, in addition to mobilizing all the workers in the workshop and family members of the staff to assist, they also had to send some of the work to be processed outside the factory. Since April of last year, twenty-five people have been transferred to support new enterprises, rural areas, and weak links in the factory. Now, the group has only seven workers, and they can still frequently support other groups, turning production from passive to active.

On November 3, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League made a decision requiring the Communist Youth League organizations in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the province, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, to organize young workers in a planned and guided manner to study the advanced ideas and exemplary deeds of the Zhou Baisheng Group, further deepen the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," and launch a labor competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the Zhou Baisheng Group, so that this study will become a powerful driving force for promoting the increase production and economizing movement, saving labor, and supporting agriculture.

### 增产减人周柏生小组一马当先  一年间，全组从三十二人减为七人，劳动生产率提高十二倍  共青团广东省委号召全省青年职工开展学赶超周柏生小组竞赛

    增产减人周柏生小组一马当先
    一年间，全组从三十二人减为七人，劳动生产率提高十二倍
    共青团广东省委号召全省青年职工开展学赶超周柏生小组竞赛
    据新华社广州电　广东省开平县三埠电厂电机车间周柏生小组（铁芯组），一年间从三十二人减为七人，生产计划月月超额完成，并提前四个月完成了今年全年的生产计划，劳动生产率提高十二倍，产品成品率提高到98％。从今年5月以来，全组基本上不领原料材料，利用废旧料和边角碎料生产，仅第三季度就为国家节约了六吨矽钢片。
    周柏生小组能够减人增产，主要是因为他们具有一股发愤改变“一穷二白”面貌，加速社会主义建设的雄心壮志。这个小组在1958年8月成立时，只有三把手剪、三个圆规和两台又旧又小的手摇冲床，全组三十二人没有一人懂得电机制造技术，90％以上是学徒（其中新学徒占80％）。初制电动机时，由于全部是手工操作，产品质量不好，当时曾发生“上马”还是“下马”的争论，主张“下马”的人认为“没有五吨冲床，休想制造电动机”。但是这群青年人没有被困难吓倒。他们说：“我们能够用土法制出电动机来，也一定能够过好质量关”。在党支部的领导下，他们全用废旧料制成了万能剪床、各式冲床、铡床等十台“土”的或简易的机械，使89％的操作用上了机械，并且生产出质量良好的电动机、发电机。这个小组实现减人增产的另一个方法是：人人一专多能，实行劳动力的综合利用。他们以能者为师，分工辅导，以车间当课堂，设备当教材，经常进行技术学习，不断提高技术水平。经过两年来生产实践、革新、学习，全组现有的七个工人都成了技术多面手，生产电机铁芯，大小共二十三道工序，他们七个人都能应付自如。
    由于机械化程度和工人技术水平的提高，全组生产面貌根本改观。过去全组三十二人，劳动力还感觉不足，生产任务较多的时候，除了动员全车间工人、职工家属协助以外，还要送一部分活到厂外加工。从去年4月开始，先后抽调了二十五人支援新建企业、农村和本厂薄弱环节，现在全组只七个工人，还能经常支援别的小组，生产从被动变成了主动。
    共青团广东省委于11月3日作出决定，要求全省工矿企业的共青团组织在党委的统一领导下，有计划有领导地组织青年职工学习周柏生小组的先进思想和模范事迹，进一步深入开展以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，掀起学、赶、超周柏生小组的劳动竞赛，使这个学习成为推动增产节约运动、节约劳动力支援农业的强大动力。
