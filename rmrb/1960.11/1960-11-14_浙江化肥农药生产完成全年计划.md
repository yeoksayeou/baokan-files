Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 13th: Zhejiang Province's chemical fertilizer production had already exceeded its annual plan by 66% by the end of October, a threefold increase compared to last year's total output. The province's pesticide production has also exceeded the state plan by 34%, completing it ahead of schedule, representing a two-and-a-half-fold increase compared to last year's total output. At present, large quantities of chemical fertilizers and pesticides produced by chemical plants throughout the province are being continuously transported to rural areas for application to winter crops.

The winter planting area in Zhejiang Province has generally expanded this year compared to last year, and the demand for fertilizers and pesticides has also increased significantly. Workers in Zhejiang Province's chemical industry system have deeply engaged in a production campaign centered on increasing the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to support agriculture. Many factories that did not originally produce chemical fertilizers and pesticides are also using their brains, utilizing factory scraps, waste residues, waste liquids, and other materials as raw materials to produce low-cost, high-quality chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The organic fertilizer produced by the Wenzhou Organic Chemical Plant using scraps can loosen the soil after application and is very popular among the masses.

Chemical plants in Jinhua, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and other places have also dispatched a group of technical workers to rural areas to help the communes' and production teams' local chemical fertilizer and pesticide factories manufacture high-quality, low-cost, and diverse local chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and teach commune members the technology of using chemical fertilizers and pesticides to maximize their effectiveness.

    浙江化肥农药生产完成全年计划
    新华社杭州13日电  浙江省的化肥生产已经在10月底超额66％完成全年计划，比去年总产量增长三倍；全省农药生产也已超额34％提前完成了国家计划，比去年总产量增长二倍半。现在，由各地化工厂生产出来的大量化肥、农药，正源源运往农村供冬种粮食作物施用。
    浙江省各地今年冬种面积普遍比去年扩大，肥料和农药的需要量也比过去增加很多。浙江省化工系统职工深入开展了以增产化肥、农药为中心的支援农业的生产运动。许多原来不生产化肥、农药的工厂，工人们也开动脑筋，利用厂内下脚、废渣、废液等作原料，生产成本低、质量好的化肥、农药。温州市有机化工厂利用下脚料制造出的化肥，施用后能使土壤疏松，深受群众欢迎。
    金华、嘉兴、宁波等地化工厂还抽调一批技术工人下乡帮助公社、生产队的土化肥、土农药厂制造质量高、成本低、品种多的土化肥、土农药，并向社员传授使用化肥、农药的技术，使化肥、农药发挥更大作用。
