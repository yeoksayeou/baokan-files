Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, November 23rd: Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, who is currently in Bonn, has expressed concern that the United States may ask Norway to increase its share of military expenses in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Lange said today that Norway has not ruled out the possibility that the United States will make such a request. He said that Norway has not yet received such a request from the United States. However, he believes that after the United States consults with one of its allies (referring to West Germany) on this issue, it will "naturally" discuss the issue with other allies.

    担心多摊军费挪威表示不安
    新华社波恩23日电　正在波恩的挪威外交大臣兰格表示担心美国会要求挪威增加它在北大西洋集团军事费用中负担的份额。
    兰格今天说，挪威没有排除美国向它提出这种要求的可能性。他说，挪威至少还没有接到美国方面提出的这样的要求。但是，他认为，美国在同它的一个盟国（指西德）就这个问题磋商以后，“很自然地”会同其他盟国谈这个问题。
