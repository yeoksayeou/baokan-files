In My Position

    A Record of Exploring the River
    Tang Shaoyue, Jinggangshan Administration Bureau, Jiangxi
    In order to quickly transport the abundant bamboo and wood resources that have been dormant in Jinggangshan for many years to places needed for the country's socialist construction, we are building mountain chutes and waterways simultaneously. In this way, the cut maozhu bamboo and trees slide down the mountain chutes one by one, row by row, into the river, and then slide along the waterway to the shore.
    The construction of the chutes is carried out by surveying and building simultaneously. At first, it went smoothly, but when the vanguard team responsible for cutting down weeds and building bridges arrived at a place called Da Quekou (Big Gap), they were stunned. The stone walls on both sides rise straight from the bottom of the valley to the mountainside, smooth and bare, with no trees to climb on and no cracks in the stone to insert a foothold. Above is a steep "bow"-shaped mountain terrain. Further up, there is a waterfall with a head of water five or six meters high, rushing straight down. Although we cannot see the waterfall while standing in the mountain gully, we can infer the fierceness of the water from the fog filling the gully and the rumbling noise.
    The waterway stopped here. What should we do?
    Not long ago, we conquered the Longtan Waterfall by splitting the mountain to divert the water: carving a flume on the stone wall next to the waterfall, so that wooden rafts and bamboo rafts could flow down the flume and through the stone wall. But here? The stone wall is too steep and too curved, so it is impossible to carve a flume. Should we open a waterway at the bottom of the valley? The valley is too narrow, and the blasted rubble will inevitably accumulate at the bottom of the valley, and the river water will flow away from the cracks in the rock, so it is still impossible to release rafts.
    It seems we must think of another clever plan. We decided to divide into two groups for surveying. I am responsible for surveying the upper section of the river and also for finding out the impact of this waterfall on the river.
    The straight-line distance from Da Quekou to this waterfall is only two li, but it took more than twenty li to circle around to the upstream of the waterfall. Standing there and looking at the waterfall is like a white silk hanging down from the sky. At the halfway point, this white silk is smashed by a stone mountain and turns into thousands of beaded curtains, which are particularly dazzling in the lush, dark valley. However, at this time, who is in the mood to appreciate the beauty of nature? I just looked down and searched for a path in the boulder-strewn river valley.
    The river valley is getting narrower and narrower, and it is also getting darker and darker. The precarious cliffs on both sides, as well as the miscellaneous trees and vines squeezed out of the cracks in the rocks, are vibrating with the rumbling sound of the water, as if they will all collapse at any time. I was very nervous, and slipped several times in a row in the boulder piles covered with slippery green moss. My shoes and pants were soaked in water, and my steps became more difficult, but my mind became clearer. As I walked, I visually measured the width and slope of the river valley, calculated the required stonework, and checked the resources on both sides of the river.
    When I was approaching the waterfall, a large beach appeared in front of me, very bright and bare, without a single weed. This is the result of years of scouring by mountain floods. I jumped onto the beach and looked up at the waterfall hanging straight down, feeling particularly excited and happy. The doubt was resolved! I was worried that the waterfall would directly rush into the river valley that intersects it at a right angle. If that were the case, it would be impossible to release bamboo and wood rafts at all. But in front of me, the waterfall is more than thirty meters away from the river valley and does not pose much of an obstacle!
    However, now is the dry season. What about the flood season? We still need to further investigate the main flow direction of the waterfall and the maximum flow during the flood season. Facing the water droplets splashing like raindrops from the waterfall, I carefully climbed upwards along the edge of the waterfall. Although this was a bit reckless, I couldn't see the truth without doing so. When I climbed to a place thirty meters high, a very steep, smooth stone slab blocked my way. I wanted to retreat and find another way, but when I looked down, good heavens! In the deep valley, the rushing waterfall roared, and the splashing waves made people dizzy. How dangerous it would be to slide down the stone wall! Fortunately, there was a stone crevice slanting elsewhere next to it, so I leaned my body on the stone slab and moved sideways one foot at a time. This distance was only twenty meters, but after climbing it, I was covered in sweat.
    After I grabbed the grass roots and climbed up a steep slope, I found a lot of wild animal droppings, which was an important revelation: there must be a path nearby for wild animals to drink water. Sure enough, I finally found a vaguely discernible path. Following this path, I returned to the side of the waterfall. When I climbed up the mountain again, I was already in a cheerful mood, and the noisy and joyful labor scene of how to repair the waterway and release the wood and bamboo rafts after the mountain chute was opened constantly appeared in my mind. I seemed to have already seen our heroic raftsmen, driving strings of wood and bamboo rafts, racing down in the raging streams. At this time, the sun shone thousands of rays of light from behind the high mountains, the mountains and forests were even more lush, and the pure white Mengchun flowers and the bright red mountain peach blossoms were in full bloom in the wind. How charming is the scenery of the mountainous area!

    探河记
    江西井冈山管理局　唐少岳
    为了把长年沉睡在井冈山上的丰富的竹木资源，很快地运送到祖国社会主义建设所需要的地方去，我们一面修筑山滑道，一面修筑水道。这样，砍伐下来的茅竹、树木，一根根一排排顺着山滑道滑到河里，又顺着水道滑到岸上。
    滑道的工程，是一面勘查，一面修筑，交替进行的。开头还顺利，但当负责斩杂架桥的先遣队来到一个名叫大缺口的地方的时候，不禁楞住了。两岸的石壁从半山腰一直插到谷底，光溜溜地，没有一棵树木可供攀援，没有一条石缝可以插脚。往上是一个急剧的“弓”字形拐弯的山势。再往上有一条水头高五、六米的瀑布，急泻直下。虽然我们站在山沟里看不见瀑布，但从满沟的雾气和轰隆隆的巨响中，可以推断水势的凶猛。
    水道到此停住了，怎么办呢？
    我们不久以前征服过龙潭瀑布，用的是劈山引水方法：在瀑布旁边的石壁上开凿一条水槽，使木排、竹排顺着水槽、穿过石壁流放下去。而这里呢？石壁太陡，又过于弯曲，开凿水槽是不行的。在谷底开一条水道吧？谷里太窄，炸下来的碎石势必都堆积在谷底，河水就会从石缝里流走，还是不能放排。
    看来必须另想妙计了。我们决定分两组进行勘查。我负责勘查上一段河道，还要查清这条瀑布对河道的影响。
    从大缺到这条瀑布的直线距离不过两华里，但却足足绕了二十多华里的圈子才到达瀑布的上游。站在那里看这条瀑布，就像是从天上垂下来的一条白绸。到了半山腰，这白绸被一堵石山撞得粉碎，变成了万条珠帘，在一片葱绿的幽黑的深谷中，分外光彩夺目。可是，这时候，谁还有心情欣赏这大自然的美景呢？我只顾低头在乱石垒垒的河谷里找路。
    河谷越来越狭窄了，也越来越显得阴暗。两岸的危岩峭壁，以及从石缝里挤出来的杂树藤蔓，都随着隆隆的水声在振动，似乎时刻都会一齐塌下来。我的情绪非常紧张，在铺满了滑润润的青苔的乱石堆里一连滑倒几跤，鞋子、裤子都被水浸透了，步履更加艰难，但我的头脑倒清醒起来。我一边走，一边目测着河谷的宽度、坡度，心里计算着所需的石方工程，查看河两岸的资源。
    快接近瀑布的时候，前面出现了一个很大的河滩，非常光亮，一根杂草也不生，这是长年累月被山洪冲击的结果。我跳到了滩滩上，仰望这悬空直泻的瀑布，心里分外激动和喜悦，疑团解除了！原来我担心这条瀑布是不是直接冲到与它直角相交的河谷里？要是那样的话，就根本无法放排竹木。而眼前，瀑布离开河谷还有三十多米，没多大妨碍了！
    但是，现在是枯水季节，洪水季节又将如何呢？还得进一步查清瀑布的主要流向和洪水季节的最大流量。我迎着像雨点一样的瀑布飞溅开来的水珠，小心翼翼地顺着瀑布的边缘向上爬。这样做虽然有些冒失，但不这样又看不出究竟来。爬到三十米高的地方，一块很陡的光溜溜的大石板挡住了去路。我想退下去重找一条路，向下一看，好家伙！深邃的谷底里，冲下去的瀑布奔腾咆哮着，浪花四溅，使人头晕目眩，顺着石壁向下滑有多么危险！幸好旁边有一条石缝斜斜通向别处，我就把身子俯在石板上，一脚一脚横着挪。这段距离不过二十米，爬完之后却已混身汗水淋漓。
    当我揪着草根爬上一根陡坡之后，发现了很多野兽的粪便，这是一个重要的启示：附近一定有野兽去水面饮水的道路。果然，我终于找到了一条依稀可辨的小径。沿着这条小径，我回到了瀑布身边。当我再向山上爬去的时候，已经心情舒畅，脑子里不断出现了如何整修水道和山滑道修通后流放木排竹排时的那种喧闹欢快的劳动场面。我似乎已经看到了我们那些英雄的排工们，正驾驭着一串串木排、竹排，在暴跳的溪水中飞奔而下了。这时，太阳在高山后面发出万道霞光，山林更加苍郁，洁白的梦春花和红艳艳的山桃花迎风怒放，山区的景色多么迷人啊！
