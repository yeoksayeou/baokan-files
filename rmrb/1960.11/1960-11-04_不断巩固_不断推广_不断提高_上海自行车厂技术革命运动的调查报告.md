Factory and Mine Investigation

    Continuously Consolidate, Continuously Promote, Continuously Improve
    --An Investigation Report on the Technical Revolution Movement at the Shanghai Bicycle Factory Gong Sicheng
    The technical revolution movement at the Shanghai Bicycle Factory has been carried out very well since the beginning of this year. To date, 3,330 innovation projects have been realized in the entire factory.
    The consolidation of innovation projects that have been put into production is relatively good. According to an inspection in late September, out of 3,242 projects, 3,021 have been put into normal production, accounting for 93%. The more prominent projects have been consolidated and developed. A small number of abandoned projects are mainly due to the limited effect after several trials.
    Due to the continuous consolidation, continuous development, and continuous improvement of technical revolution projects, the degree of "four modernizations" has also been greatly improved, and many new processes have been created, saving a large amount of raw materials. For example, after installing a set and self-manufacturing a set of resistance welding pipe equipment, 18,000 oxygen cylinders can be saved in a year. In the first eight months of this year, although there were many difficulties in production, due to the vigorous technical revolution, 50,000 more bicycles were produced than in the entire last year.
    Why can the technical revolution of this factory achieve continuous consolidation, continuous development, and continuous improvement?
    Stand high, see far, think of the next step after taking this step, continuously revolutionize, thoroughly revolutionize
    Over the past few years, this factory has encountered many difficulties in production and technical revolution, but they have always maintained a strong revolutionary spirit, overcome the difficulties, and achieved results. After achieving results, they never become complacent, relaxed, or stagnant. This is the main reason why they can continuously develop in production and technical revolution.
    Communists are proponents of continuous revolution, and the Bicycle Factory Party Committee often uses this most thorough revolutionary thought to educate and arm cadres and the masses. They believe that it is necessary to constantly educate cadres and the masses to stand high, see far, and establish lofty ambitions; and constantly put forward specific directions for advancement, leading the masses forward.
    In the past two years, the Party Committee has continuously put forward clear and powerful fighting slogans, constantly encouraging the masses to strive for greater achievements. For example, in response to some cadres' belief that light industrial factories (the bicycle factory belongs to the light industry system) should give way and not leap forward, they put forward the slogan of "both give way and leap forward." At the beginning of this year, in response to the situation that output and cost were lagging behind the national advanced level, they put forward the slogan of "striving for the highest output, best quality, most varieties, and lowest cost." Recently, they put forward the slogan of "five most (adding safety first) red to the end, strive for the first class." Through continuous and extensive publicity and education, these slogans have taken root in the hearts of the people and become a huge force inspiring the masses to move forward.
    When considering and proposing specific goals and tasks, they see the next step after taking this step. This requires not only grasping the current production tasks and key issues and solving them in a timely manner, but also proposing the next stage of struggle goals in advance, and preparing conditions for achieving this goal. Therefore, the work is more proactive, smoothly leading the masses from one victory to another.
    The ideological obstacle that affects the continuous development of the technical revolution is mainly arrogance and complacency, and they are also relatively vigilant about this. Several leading cadres of the Party Committee often conduct "ideological cleansing," "wash their faces, and wipe off the dust." For example, the chain workshop did well in the technical revolution in the first half of this year and was often praised, but by June, the branch did not put forward new directions for action in a timely manner, and the movement subsided. After the Party Committee inspected this situation, it believed that the workshop leading cadres had complacency, and criticized them. After criticism and self-criticism, the workshop cadres continued to work hard, and in August, they finally developed technical innovation projects such as the chain joint automatic assembly machine.
    Investigation - Balance - Innovation, then Re-investigation - Re-balance - Re-innovation, repeating in cycles, spiraling upwards
    The "Investigation - Balance - Innovation" formula is an important method for organizing production in this factory.
    The so-called investigation is to check and verify the production capacity (including equipment capacity and labor force) of each process, each group, section, workshop, and even the entire factory within a certain period of time, and find out the main weak links of the entire factory according to the relatively advanced level. In the past, an investigation was conducted once a year, but it was later improved to once a quarter. The so-called balance is that each group, section, and workshop finds out the advanced level every month, and then strives to catch up with the advanced level. The work of investigation and balance is to mobilize the masses to conduct self-investigation, and combine it with professional measurement. Based on the results of the investigation, the Party Committee promptly puts forward specific goals for improving production capacity, and based on the weak links exposed by the investigation and balance, mobilizes the masses to think of ways, propose measures, formulate plans, and engage in innovation. "One investigation per quarter, one balance per month, innovation never stops," has now become a regular system. Investigation, balance, innovation, re-investigation, re-balance, and re-innovation promote them to continuously put forward specific goals for struggle, continuously expose weak links, and continuously engage in technical revolution aimed at key production issues, thereby promoting the continuous development of production.
    To implement the "Investigation - Balance - Innovation" formula, it is necessary to go through a profound ideological struggle. Before the Great Leap Forward, investigation and balance work were also carried out. After finding out the weak links, infrastructure construction plans were formulated; technical measures plans and labor force plans were formulated, but after these plans were formulated, some cadres asked the higher authorities for money, people, and equipment. This has become: "Investigation - Balance - Reaching Out." The transformation from "Investigation - Balance - Reaching Out" to "Investigation - Balance - Innovation" is a process of intense struggle between the thinking of "looking upward and relying on others" and the thinking of "facing the masses, relying on oneself"; it is also a process of continuously breaking superstitions, emancipating the mind, and carrying forward the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. Taking the electroplating workshop as an example, it was once a weak link in the entire factory, and every time there was talk of increasing production, it would ask for more people. After innovation last year, a part of the workers was transferred, and when increasing production and saving in the fourth quarter, they complained of "exhausting the potential," "advanced suffered losses," and "it is difficult to innovate again," and so on. Later, after seriously criticizing this kind of thinking, they looked downward, mobilized the masses, and in just one month, they developed a program-controlled automatic electroplating line, saving a large amount of labor. Then, this year, they realized several automatic and semi-automatic production lines in polishing. As a result, morale was greatly boosted, confidence was full, and they became a model workshop in production and technical revolution in the entire factory. Similar ideological struggles have taken place from the factory headquarters to various workshops, and have not been interrupted so far. They will inevitably have new manifestations under new circumstances in the future, so they must not be relaxed.
    To grasp consolidation, there must be a determination to grasp it to the end, to grasp it tightly, and to have the spirit of having to get it started and having to consolidate it
    After the high tide of the technical revolution appeared, the Party Committee grasped the development of new projects on the one hand, and also grasped the consolidation of old projects very tightly.
    In the first quarter of this year, they conducted a serious inspection and ranking of the 2,800 projects that had been realized, and found that 245 projects had not been consolidated. They immediately assigned responsibilities at different levels and vigorously grasped consolidation, requiring all unused equipment to be put into production. Now, most of these projects have been consolidated. For example, out of the 51 major projects personally controlled by the factory headquarters, 37 have now been put into normal production completely, and most of the remaining 14 have basically passed the technical barrier.
    Technical revolution measures generally have to go through a process of adjustment and improvement from the beginning of implementation to normal production. The higher the efficiency of the project, the more complex the structure, and the more problems encountered. In this process, various doubts and wavering thoughts will appear, and ideological struggles are very frequent. Therefore, to grasp consolidation, first of all, there must be a "stubborn" determination to persevere to the end. According to the workers of this factory: "What is shouted out must be realized," "What is done must be successful." Without this determination, a complete victory cannot be achieved. They have many specific experiences in grasping tightly to the end. In addition to constantly "ideological cleansing" to solve ideological problems, the main thing is to organize battles, help key points, fight annihilation battles, and not withdraw until success. In May and August, two major battles were organized to grasp consolidation, concentrating the technical forces of the entire factory, focusing on helping the metalworking workshop, driving the overall situation, and at the same time helping other workshops break through one or two key projects, driving general projects. Each workshop also adopted the method of "concentrating on large projects and dispersing small projects," assigning responsibilities at different levels. Therefore, the consolidation of key and general projects is relatively fast. Second, to find the law in consolidation. The automated single machines in the metalworking workshop often had problems after being put into production. At the beginning, they treated the head when it hurt and the foot when it hurt, and they could not be consolidated. Later, they gradually discovered several common problems. For example, the machine tools with automatic single-piece feeding often break down because if the blank is automatically loaded onto the chuck from the hopper, if you are a little careless, or if the blank specifications are a little different, the chuck will be blown out, and sometimes the entire transmission mechanism will be damaged. After finding this reason, a safety device was installed on the chuck to solve the problem. Third, to grasp tightly and promote everyone to get started, and have to consolidate it. For measures that can improve production efficiency, once implemented, tasks are arranged and plans are assessed according to the new level; for measures that can save people, people are reduced after implementation; for measures that save raw materials, materials are supplied according to the new quota after implementation. The workshop cadres said: The factory's grasping of this hand has greatly promoted us and made it necessary for us to consolidate.
    Consolidating old projects one by one has a great impetus for the development of new projects. Because "every shot hits," "every battle must be won," which is conducive to boosting morale and building confidence. This is a great political force. At the same time, it also points out the direction of development for new projects. The development of new projects is actually promotion and improvement. Their approach is to summarize the experiences and lessons of old projects and propose the direction for further development of the technical revolution. After the electroplating workshop realized a program-controlled automatic electroplating production line for copper-tin alloy plating, iron-zinc alloy plating, chrome plating, and zinc plating are now being converted to automatic lines. The newly designed automatic line is more economical and more efficient than the existing ones. The principle of program control in electroplating has now been applied to the paint workshop, enabling the paint workshop to find a way to get rid of manual labor.
    Take users as the main body to carry out the three-way combination of design, manufacturing, and use
    Among the innovation projects realized in the first half of the year, the general projects realized by the workshops and groups themselves are relatively consolidated or relatively easy to consolidate. The most difficult to consolidate are the projects controlled by the factory headquarters.
    Why are the projects controlled by the factory headquarters not easy to consolidate? In addition to being more technically complex, the main reason is the separation of design, manufacturing, and use; that is, designed by the factory's technical personnel, manufactured by the mechanical workshop, and finally delivered to the production workshop for use.
    In the past, most of the user workshops wanted to wait for the factory headquarters to take "major measures" to solve their key production issues, but when some innovation projects were put into production, they often had problems, and the efficiency was even lower than before. In this case, the contradictions became prominent, and the production workshop complained that the measures did not solve the problems, and withdrew the workers to produce according to the old methods. Some people also complained: "I don't have time to serve your machine." The mechanical workshop was also impatient, thinking that "I have made it according to the drawings, so it's none of my business," and refused to send people to participate in the overhaul. The technical personnel believed that their design "cannot be wrong," and blamed the manufacturing was not good, and the use was not good. Therefore, many projects are not that technical problems cannot be solved, but that several aspects are not well combined, and cannot be grasped, so they cannot be consolidated for a long time.
    In early August, the Party Committee analyzed these situations and grasped the second "consolidation battle" again. At this time, this practice was fundamentally changed. The method of grasping "consolidation" this time was to hand over the responsibility of consolidation to the metalworking workshop, and let them organize the operating workers to improve it themselves. Technical personnel and the mechanical workshop also sent special personnel to participate, but they were under the unified leadership of the metalworking workshop. At the same time, the metalworking workshop was given a deadline to consolidate and put into production, and the plan was arranged and assessed according to the new production capacity level. In this way, the situation completely changed. The workshop seriously grasped it, and all aspects gave support, especially selecting a group of experienced masters to be the operators, and brainstorming and overhauling together. The operating workers directly took action, put forward many problems and practical suggestions, and developed feelings for the new equipment in the process of overhauling, and became familiar with the performance of the machine. The production workshop cadres took command, the operating workers took action, and the technical personnel and mechanical departments helped. In less than half a month, most of the projects were consolidated. The cadres, workers, especially the technical personnel, had a deep understanding of this change. Some technical personnel said: "We have been talking about the three-way combination every year, and this time we understand what the three-way combination is."
    The technical revolution movement in the bicycle factory has many achievements and many experiences. At present, on the basis of summarizing the experience of the previous stage, they are continuing to move forward and continue to set off a new upsurge of technical revolution.

    不断巩固　不断推广　不断提高
    ——上海自行车厂技术革命运动的调查报告　龚思成
    上海自行车厂今年以来技术革命运动开展得很好。到目前止，在全厂已经实现三千三百三十个革新项目。
    已经投入生产的革新项目，巩固的情况是比较好的。据9月下旬的检查，在三千二百四十二个项目中，已经正常投入生产的有三千零二十一个，占93％。比较突出的项目，都已巩固并有所发展。少数放弃不用的项目，主要是因为试过几次效果不大。
    由于技术革命项目不断巩固、不断发展、不断提高，“四化”程度也有很大提高，并创造了不少新工艺，节省了大量原材料。如安装一套和自制一套电阻焊管设备后，一年可少用一万八千瓶氧气。今年前八个月，虽然生产上的困难较多，但由于大闹技术革命，还比去年全年多生产五万辆自行车。
    这个厂的技术革命为什么能够做到不断巩固、不断发展、不断提高呢？
    站得高，望得远，走这一步想下一步，不断革命，彻底革命
    几年来，这个厂在生产和技术革命方面都遇到了很多的困难，但他们始终保持旺盛的革命精神，战胜了困难，取得了成绩。而在取得成绩以后，从不自满松懈，停滞不前。这是他们所以能在生产、技术革命方面不断发展的主要原因。
    共产党人是不断革命论者，自行车厂党委就经常用这种最彻底的革命思想教育、武装干部和群众。他们认为必须不断教育干部和群众站得高望得远，树雄心大志；并不断提出前进的具体方向，领导群众前进。
    最近两年，党委不断提出了鲜明有力的战斗口号，不断鼓舞群众为争取更大成就而斗争。例如，针对有些干部认为轻工业厂（自行车厂属轻工业系统）要让路不能跃进的思想，提出了“既让路、又跃进”的口号。今年年初针对产量、成本落后于全国先进水平的情况，提出了“力争产量最高、质量最好、品种最多、成本最低”的口号，最近又提出了“五最（增加一个安全第一）红到底，力争第一流”的口号。经过不断地广泛地宣传教育，这些口号深入人心，成为鼓舞群众前进的巨大力量。
    在考虑提出具体目标和任务时，他们走这一步就看到下一步。这就不仅要抓紧当前的生产任务和关键问题及时加以解决，而且还要预先提出下一步的斗争目标，并为达到这个目标准备条件。因此，工作就比较主动，顺利地领导群众从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。
    影响技术革命不断发展的思想障碍主要是骄傲自满，他们对此也比较警惕。党委几个领导干部，经常务虚，“洗洗脸，擦擦灰”。如链条车间今年上半年技术革命开展得好，经常受表扬，但到6月份支部没有及时提出新的行动方向来，运动沉寂了。党委检查了这一情况后认为车间领导干部有自满思想，就对他们提出批评。车间干部经过批评和自我批评，继续抓紧，8月份，终于搞出了链条联合自动装配机等技术革新项目。
    查定——平衡——革新，再查定——再平衡——再革新，如是往复循环，螺旋式上升
    “查定——平衡——革新”的公式，是这个厂组织生产的一个重要方法。
    所谓查定，就是在一定时期内检查和核定每道工序、每个小组、工段、车间以至全厂的生产能力（包括设备能力和劳动力），并按照比较先进的水平，找出全厂主要的薄弱环节。过去是一年一查定，以后改进为一季一查定。所谓平衡，就是各个小组、工段、车间，每月找出先进水平，然后向先进水平看齐。查定和平衡的工作，都是发动群众自查，并且与专业人员测算相结合。党委根据查定的结果，及时提出提高生产能力的具体目标，并根据查定、平衡暴露出来的若干薄弱环节，发动群众想办法、提措施、订规划、搞革新。“一季一查定，一月一平衡，革新没个停”，现在已经形成经常性的制度。查定、平衡、革新、再查定、再平衡、再革新，就促使他们不断地提出具体的奋斗目标，不断地暴露薄弱环节，不断地针对生产关键大闹技术革命，从而推动生产不断地向前发展。
    贯彻“查定——平衡——革新”的公式，要经过深刻的思想斗争。大跃进以前，也搞查定和平衡工作，在找出薄弱环节以后，就订基建计划；订了技术措施计划、劳动力计划，但在订了这些计划之后，有些干部就向上面要钱、要人、要设备。这样就变成了：“查定——平衡——伸手”。从“查定——平衡——伸手”变为“查定——平衡——革新”，是“眼睛向上，伸手依赖”的思想跟“面向群众，自力更生”的思想激烈斗争的过程；也是不断破除迷信，解放思想，发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格的过程。以电镀车间为例，过去一度是全厂的一个薄弱环节，一讲增产就伸手要人。去年搞革新后抽调了一部分工人，四季度搞增产节约时就叫“潜力挖尽”、“先进吃亏”、“再革新有困难了”等等。后来严肃地批判了这种思想以后，眼睛向下，发动群众，只用了一个月时间，就搞成了一条程序控制电镀自动线，节约了大量劳动力，接着，今年又在抛磨方面实现了几条自动半自动生产线。因此士气大振，信心十足，成为全厂生产和技术革命中的标兵车间。类似这样的思想斗争，从厂部到各个车间都有过，到目前还没有间断，以后也必然会在新的情况下有新的表现形式，因此决不能放松。
    抓巩固要有一抓到底的决心，要抓住不放，要有非上马不可、非巩固下来不可的气概
    技术革命出现高潮以后，党委一方面抓新项目的发展，同时对老项目的巩固工作也抓得很紧。
    今年第一季度他们就对已经实现的二千八百个项目作了一次认真的检查、排队，发现有二百四十五项没有巩固，立即分层负责，大抓巩固，要求所有未用的设备都要投入生产。现在，这些项目大部分都已巩固。如厂部亲自掌握的五十一个重大项目，现在已经完全正常投入生产的有三十七项，其余十四项，多数也基本上过了技术关。
    技术革命措施从开始实现到正常投入生产，一般总要经过一个调整、改进的过程。越是效率高的项目，结构比较复杂，遇到的问题就越多。在这个过程中，各种怀疑、动摇的思想都会出现，思想斗争是很频繁的。因此，抓巩固首先要有个坚持到底的“死心眼”。按这个工厂职工的说法：“喊出来的非实现不可”、“做出来的非成功不可”。没有这个决心，不能取得全胜。他们抓紧抓到底的具体经验很多，除了不断务虚解决思想问题外，主要的是组织战役，帮助重点，打歼灭战，不成功不收兵。5月份和8月份，组织了两次大抓巩固的战役，集中全厂技术力量，重点帮助金工车间，带动全面，同时帮助其它车间突破一两个重点项目，带动一般的项目。各车间也采取“大项目集中，小项目分散”的办法，分层负责，因此，重点和一般的项目，巩固都比较快。其次是在巩固中找规律。金工车间的自动化单机投入生产后经常出毛病，开始时头痛医头、脚痛医脚，始终巩固不下来。以后逐步摸索到几个共同问题。如单件自动进料的机床经常损坏，原因是毛坯从漏斗自动装上夹头时，稍一不慎，或毛坯规格有点差异，夹头就被爆坏，有时把整个传动机构都损坏。找到这个原因以后，就在夹头上装了保险装置，解决了这个问题。第三，要抓住不放，促进大家上马，非巩固下来不可。对能提高生产效率的措施，一旦实现后，就按新的水平安排任务、考核计划；对可以节约人的措施，实现后就减人；对节约原材料的措施，实现后就按新定额给料。车间干部说：厂部抓这一手，对我们促进很大，使我们非巩固不可。
    老项目逐项巩固，对新项目的发展有莫大的推动作用。因为“弹无虚发”，“每战必胜”，有利于鼓舞士气、树立信心。这是一种很大的政治力量。同时也为新项目指出发展方向。新项目的发展，实际上就是推广、提高。他们的做法是，总结老项目的经验、教训，提出技术革命进一步发展的方向。电镀车间实现了一条镀铜锡合金的程序控制自动电镀生产线后，现在镀铁锌合金、镀铬、镀锌都在改为自动线。新设计的自动线，比已有的更经济，效率更高。电镀方面的程序控制的原理，现在已经运用到油漆车间，使油漆车间找到了摆脱体力劳动的方向。
    以使用者为主体大搞设计、制造、使用三结合
    在上半年实现的革新项目中，由车间、小组自己动手实现的一般项目，都比较巩固或比较容易巩固。最不容易巩固的是厂部掌握的项目。
    为什么厂部掌握的项目不容易巩固呢？这除了技术上比较复杂外，主要原因是设计、制造、使用三者分离；即由厂部技术人员设计、机动车间制造，最后送交生产车间使用。
    过去，使用车间多半想等待厂部采取“重大措施”，来解决自己的生产关键，但有些革新项目投入生产时，往往出毛病，效率甚至比原来还低。在这种情况下，矛盾就突出了，生产车间埋怨措施不解决问题，把工人抽回去按老办法生产。有的人还埋怨说：“没功夫服侍你们这台机器”。机动车间也不耐烦，认为“按图纸造成了就没我的事”，不肯派人参加检修。技术人员认为自己设计的“不会错”，怪制造不好，怪使用不好。因此，许多项目并不是技术问题解决不了，而是几个方面没有结合好，抓不起来，因此长期巩固不下来。
    到了8月初，党委分析了这些情况，又抓第二次“巩固战役”，这时，才根本改变了这种做法。这次抓“巩固”的办法是把巩固的责任交给金工车间，由他们组织操作工人自己动手改进，技术人员和机动车间也派专人参加，但归金工车间统一领导。同时限期要金工车间巩固、投入生产，并按新的生产能力水平安排和考核计划。这样一来，情况就完全改变了。车间认真抓起来，各方面给予支持，特别是选择一批有经验的老师傅担任操作，并一起出主意，一起动手检修。操作工人直接动手，提出了很多问题和切实可行的建议，并在检修的过程中与新设备发生了感情，熟悉了机器的性能。生产车间干部挂帅，操作工人动手，技术人员、机动部门帮助，不到半个月时间，绝大部分项目都巩固了。对这个变化，干部、工人，特别是技术人员体会都很深。有的技术人员说：“年年讲三结合，这回才理解什么是三结合。”
    自行车厂的技术革命运动有很多成绩，有很多经验，目前，他们在总结前一阶段经验的基础上，正在继续前进，继续掀起新的技术革命高潮。
