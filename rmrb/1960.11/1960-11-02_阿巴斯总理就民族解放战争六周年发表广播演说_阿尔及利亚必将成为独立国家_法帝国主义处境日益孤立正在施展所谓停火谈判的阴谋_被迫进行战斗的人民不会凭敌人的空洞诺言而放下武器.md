Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, October 31st: Prime Minister Ferhat Abbas of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria today delivered a radio address to the Algerian people on the sixth anniversary of the Algerian National Liberation War.

Abbas said, "Algeria has endured more than one hundred and thirty years of colonial rule and, for six years, has known the cost of its struggle through bloodshed and sacrifice in war. It is aware of the behind-the-scenes forces single-mindedly seeking to plunder its resources. All Algerians, men, women, young, and old, are aware of the reality of colonial rule." Abbas emphasized, "Therefore, the Algerian people will continue the struggle until victory, that is, until Algeria achieves liberation and the construction of the Arab Maghreb."

After pointing out that the current international situation is favorable to the struggle of the Algerian people, Abbas said, "Our task remains arduous, and our responsibility remains great. The enemy is still employing its conspiracies and tricks."

He pointed out, "The enemy possesses an army of more than 800,000 men, attempting by any means to bully and defeat us, while at the same time making promises that the French government has consistently refused to fulfill." He said, "Let us be clear. The prerequisite for self-determination is a free referendum. If the French army uses terror against the residents to control and organize this referendum, then freedom will be an illusion."

He pointed out, "Free choice means freely deciding one's own destiny, and not limiting this choice to the establishment of a dependent Algerian state, a state that will be deprived of most of the necessary attributes, split into several groups, and carve up its Saharan portion. And the aforementioned are precisely the contents of De Gaulle's desired 'Algeria for the Algerians'."

He emphasized: "The Algeria for which the Algerian people are fighting is an independent Algeria, in which the Algerian people, regardless of origin, will enjoy full civil rights." "Those who still attempt to forcibly implement a bestowed status through foolish deception have not learned their lesson at all, forgetting the bitter experience they suffered when they wanted to impose the puppet Bao Dai on the Vietnamese people."

Speaking of the conditions of the Algerian people's struggle, Abbas said, "Today, our conditions of struggle have changed. French imperialism is increasingly unpopular and isolated, while we receive the sympathy and active and effective support of the whole world."

Abbas said, "The (Algerian) government delegations' visits to China and the Soviet Union have achieved success. Our government has been recognized by the Soviet Union. This recognition will have a huge impact. We have received the support of the socialist camp. We are pleased about this; let some Western countries hypocritically brandish their anti-communist banners."

He said, "Our Arab brothers stand with us; they support us."

He pointed out, "The colonial era is gone forever. This year, people have seen fifteen African countries enter the international family. This is the result of a long struggle; the Algerian people know that they have made a great contribution to this struggle. African brothers know that, in the Algerian War, French imperialism attempted to impose a deception on people, while the Algerian people were defending a reality. We are convinced that, no matter the circumstances, the African peoples who have waged the same struggle will always support our cause. In Europe and South America, public opinion is increasingly sympathetic to the struggle of the Algerian people. All those who fight for freedom regard our struggle as their own."

He then emphasized: "However, more important than everything is the unity and vigilance of our people and the combat effectiveness and heroism of the National Liberation Army. These factors will always be our strong backing, and the conspiracies of the colonialists and the hatred of certain French soldiers will be shattered before it."

He said that the Algerian fighters are worthy of the motherland. Their courage, their heroism, and their selflessness have won the admiration of the world.

After pointing out that the French government has repeatedly refused to negotiate with the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria for a just and peaceful solution, Abbas said, "The French government's futile attempts to force us to surrender through so-called ceasefire negotiations are absurd. We took up arms only when all peaceful means had proven ineffective. We will not lay down our arms based on empty promises of self-determination, a self-determination that is handed over to the army, administration, and police, who fundamentally obliterate the very principles of self-determination. To do so would be to betray our martyrs, our victims, and our flag. It would be to subject our country to a neo-colonialism as insidious as the old colonialism."

"Those who expect us to fail, those who expect to take advantage of our fatigue, are greatly mistaken. We have made our choice: to live as free and independent African people, or to remain slaves."

Prime Minister Abbas said, "The sophistry of the imperialists, the wanton threats of the bankrupt French army against our people, cannot change or frighten our will and determination as Algerians and as Maghrebians. We are determined to make Algeria a free and independent country like other African countries."

    阿巴斯总理就民族解放战争六周年发表广播演说
    阿尔及利亚必将成为独立国家
    法帝国主义处境日益孤立正在施展所谓停火谈判的阴谋
    被迫进行战斗的人民不会凭敌人的空洞诺言而放下武器
    新华社突尼斯10月31日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯·费尔哈特今天就阿尔及利亚民族解放战争六周年，向阿尔及利亚人民发表广播演说。
    阿巴斯说，“阿尔及利亚经受了一百三十多年的殖民统治，六年以来不惜在战争中流血牺牲，深知自己所进行的斗争的代价。对于一心想掠夺它的资源的幕后势力，它是心中有数的。全体阿尔及利亚人民，不论男女老少，对殖民统治的现实都有认识”。阿巴斯强调说，“因此，阿尔及利亚人民将把斗争继续下去直到胜利，就是说，直到阿尔及利亚获得解放和建成阿拉伯马格里布。”
    在指出当前国际局势有利于阿尔及利亚人民的斗争之后，阿巴斯说，“我们的任务仍然是艰巨的，我们的责任仍然是重大的。敌人还在施展其阴谋诡计。”
    他指出，“敌人拥有一支八十多万人的军队，一面不择手段企图欺侮和打倒我们，同时作出法国政府一贯拒不履行的诺言。”他说，“让我们说清楚。自决的前提是自由的公民投票。如果法国军队对居民实行恐怖来控制和组织这种公民投票，那么，自由将是幻想”。
    他指出，“自由选择意味着自由决定自己的命运，而不是把这种选择限于成立一个附庸的阿尔及利亚国家，那样的国家将被剥夺绝大部分必要的属性，分裂成为好几个集团，宰割掉它的撒哈拉部分，而上述那些正是戴高乐所希望的‘阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚’的内容”。
    他强调指出：“阿尔及利亚人民为之战斗的阿尔及利亚，是独立的阿尔及利亚，阿尔及利亚人民将不分血统在其中享有充分的公民权利。”“仍然企图借助于愚蠢的欺骗伎俩来强行实施赐给的地位的人们，还丝毫没有吸取教训，他们忘记了他们当年想把傀儡保大强加于越南人民时所遭受的惨重失败的经验”。
    谈到阿尔及利亚人民斗争的条件时，阿巴斯说，“今天，我们的斗争条件已经改变了。法帝国主义日益不得人心而陷于孤立，而我们则得到全世界的同情和积极有效的支持”。
    阿巴斯说，“（阿尔及利亚）政府代表团对中国和苏联进行的各次访问，都取得了成就。我国政府已经得到苏联的承认。这个承认将产生巨大的影响。我们已经得到社会主义阵营的支持。我们为此感到庆幸，让某些西方国家去伪善地搬出它们的反共旗帜吧。”
    他说，“我们的阿拉伯兄弟站在我们这一边，他们支持我们。”
    他指出，“殖民时代已经一去不复返了。今年，人们看到十五个非洲国家进入国际大家庭。这是长期斗争的结果；阿尔及利亚人民知道自己对这场斗争作出了很大的贡献。非洲兄弟们知道，在阿尔及利亚战争中，法帝国主义企图把一场骗局强加于人，而阿尔及利亚人民则在捍卫一种现实。我们确信，不管情况怎样，进行了同样斗争的非洲各国人民将永远支持我们的事业。在欧洲和南美，公众舆论日益同情阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。一切为自由而战的人们，都把我们的斗争当作自己的斗争”。
  他接着强调指出：“然而，比一切都重要的是我国人民的团结和警惕以及民族解放军的战斗性和英勇，这些因素始终将是我们的坚强的后盾，殖民主义者的阴谋诡计和某些法国军人的仇恨将在它的面前碰得头破血流。”
    他说，阿尔及利亚的战士们是无愧于祖国的。他们的勇敢、他们的英雄主义、他们的忘我无私，博得全世界的钦佩。
    阿巴斯在指出法国政府多次拒绝同阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府就正义和和平的解决办法进行谈判之后说，“法国政府徒劳地企图通过所谓停火谈判来促使我们投降的尝试，是荒谬的。我们是在一切和平办法都已证明归于无效的时候，才拿起武器来的。我们不会凭空洞的自决诺言而放下武器，那种自决是交给根本抹煞了自决原则本身的军队、行政和警察来执行的。要是那样作，那将是背叛我们的烈士、殉难者和我们的旗帜。那将是使我国屈从于同老殖民主义同样恶毒的新殖民主义。”
      “那些指望我们会失败、那些指望利用我们的疲劳的人们，他们是大错特错了。作为自由的和独立的非洲人民而生活呢，还是仍然充当奴隶，我们已经作出了抉择。”
    阿巴斯总理说，“帝国主义者的诡辩，声明狼借的法国军队对我国人民的肆意威胁，都改变不了，也吓不倒我们作为阿尔及利亚人、作为马格里布人的意志和决心，我们决意要使阿尔及利亚像其它非洲国家那样成为自由和独立的国家。”
