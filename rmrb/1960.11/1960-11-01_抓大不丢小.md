Grains, cotton, and oil, among other major agricultural products, are the primary targets of procurement work. The success of procuring major agricultural products not only directly affects the food, clothing, and raw material sources for light industry for the vast population, and relates to the supply of domestic markets and export goods, but also relates to the development of agriculture and heavy industry. However, grasping the big should not mean neglecting the small. While focusing on the major and primary items, we must not abandon the minor and secondary ones. Items such as daylilies, wood ear mushrooms, and walnuts may seem insignificant, but their collection and procurement provide useful materials for people's lives and exports. Pinellia, eucommia, and gallnuts are indispensable medicinal materials. Cotton stalks, ramie, rosin, raw lacquer, and the like are important raw materials for industrial production. In addition, there are numerous types of wild oil plants, starches, and wild miscellaneous fibers, all of which are very important resources. The absence or lack of these minor and secondary agricultural and sideline native products will cause great inconvenience. Commercial departments should coordinate with relevant departments to properly arrange labor, make full use of agricultural slack time, and launch a mass movement to vigorously carry out a "small autumn harvest." All usable resources, whether domestic or wild, major or minor, primary or secondary, plant or animal, mineral or aquatic, should be collected and actively procured in a timely manner.

To achieve both big and small, with consideration for both primary and secondary, it is necessary not only to recognize its importance ideologically, but also to ensure unified planning in organizational work. First, commercial departments, with the assistance of relevant departments, should conduct prior investigation and research to deeply understand the local resources of small native products. In conjunction with the characteristics of agricultural production, they should assist communes and production teams in coordinating labor arrangements and organizing collection. Second, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance, go deep into the front lines, seize every opportunity, promptly impart collection techniques to the masses, propose specifications, and launch a blitz procurement. Third, purchasing points and purchasing groups should be established in brigades and teams; also, mass agency purchases should be organized to facilitate the collection and sale by the masses.

Opportunity knocks but once. We must seize the season and do everything possible to actively collect and procure usable materials!

    抓大不丢小
    粮、棉、油等主要农产品，是收购工作的主要对象。主要农产品收购得好坏，不仅直接关系到广大人民吃饭、穿衣和轻工业生产的原料来源，关系到国内市场和出口物资的供应，而且也关系到农业和重工业的发展。但是，抓大不能丢小。既要抓大宗主要的，也不能丢掉小宗的和次要的。像黄花、木耳、核桃等，看来似乎是微不足道的小东西，可是采集、收购起来，却是供应人民生活和出口的有用物资。半夏、杜仲、五倍子，是不可缺少的中药材。棉秆麻、松香、生漆等等，更是工业生产的重要原料。还有名目繁多的野生油料、淀粉和野杂纤维，也都是很重要的物资。缺少了或者没有了这些小宗的、次要的农副土特产品，就会造成很大的不方便。商业部门要配合有关部门妥善安排劳力，充分利用农闲时间，掀起一个大搞“小秋收”的群众运动。把一切家生和野生的、大宗和小宗的、主要和次要的、植物和动物的、矿物和水产的，凡是能够利用的资源，都及时地采集起来，并积极收购起来。
    要做到大小都抓，主次兼顾，除了在思想上必须认识它的重要意义外，在组织工作上必须做到统筹安排。首先，商业部门要在有关部门的协助下，事先做好调查研究，对当地小土特产的资源情况做到深知深解，并结合农业生产的特点，帮助公社、生产队统筹安排劳动力，组织采集。其次，要加强技术指导，深入第一线，见缝插针，及时向群众传授采集技术，提出规格要求，突击收购。第三，要在大队、小队增设收购点、收购组；还要组织群众代购，以便利群众随采随售。
    机不可失，时不再来。应当抓紧季节，尽一切可能，把可以利用的物资积极采集、收购起来！
