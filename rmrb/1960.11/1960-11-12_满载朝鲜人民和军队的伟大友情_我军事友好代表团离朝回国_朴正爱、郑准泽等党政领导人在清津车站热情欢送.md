The Chinese military friendship delegation to Korea, led by Marshal He Long and Grand General Luo Ruiqing, after a full twenty-day friendly visit to the friendly neighbor, the land of heroic comrades-in-arms – the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, this afternoon boarded a special train from Nanyang Station, North Hamgyong Province, crossed the Tumen River, and returned to the motherland, filled with the great friendship of the Korean people and army towards the Chinese people and army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe, led by the delegation, remained in Korea to continue performing.

Lieutenant General Choi Yong-jin, Vice-Minister of National Defence of Korea, and Li Guang-sil, Chairman of the North Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, with reluctance and sincere farewell, accompanied the delegation to the Korean border. Chinese Ambassador to Korea Qiao Xiaoguang and Military Attaché Senior Colonel Zhang Leting accompanied the delegation to the Korean border to see them off.

At 4:30 this afternoon, the delegation's train returning home arrived at Nanyang Station on the Korean border, and was welcomed by more than 3,000 local people and officers and soldiers of the People's Army. They held up bouquets and the national flags of Korea and China, shouting "Long live!" and constantly singing "Song of General Kim Il Sung" and "The East is Red." A huge banner was hung on the platform with the slogan "Long live the militant friendship cemented in blood between the peoples and armies of Korea and China." After the delegation arrived at the platform, they received flowers from the children and danced happily with the young men and women.

Also present at the station to welcome and see off the delegation were: Kim Gu-ho, Chairman of the Unsong County Committee of the Korean Workers' Party; Kang Seok-hwan, Chairman of the Unsong County People's Committee; Li Lim-seok, Vice Chairman of the Unsong County Committee of the Workers' Party; and Park Bong-ho, Vice Chairman of the County People's Committee. At around 5 p.m., the delegation crossed the Tumen River and returned to China amidst the enthusiastic farewells of the Korean people.

The Chinese military friendship delegation to Korea arrived in the heroic land of Korea on October 23rd at the invitation of General Kim Kwang-hyup, Vice Premier of the Cabinet and Minister of National Defence of Korea. During its twenty days in Korea, the delegation visited Pyongyang, Kaesong, Heechon, Wonsan, Kumgang Mountain, Hamhung, Chongjin and other regions, as well as many famous local factories, agricultural production cooperatives, and Korean People's Army troops. The delegation visited almost every province in northern Korea. Wherever it went, it received sincere and warm welcome from the Korean people and army. In the ranks of welcoming the Chinese guests, there were grandfathers and grandmothers in their sixties and seventies, mothers carrying their children on their backs, and children of four or five years old. Some people even traveled from afar to visit the delegation and present gifts. On November 7th, when the delegation arrived in Hamhung, two old men who had walked more than 80 kilometers from the Changjin Lake area came to see the delegation: one was Grandpa Hong Yi-hyun, who had climbed the snowy mountains in Changjin County, carried guns and ammunition, and led the volunteer army to eliminate the American invading army; the other was Grandpa Kim Bae-yun, who had rescued volunteer soldiers on the front line. When they heard that the delegation had arrived in Hamhung, they each picked a bag of good pine nuts and ran to present them to the delegation. Grandpa Kim Bae-yun said that seeing the delegation was like seeing the Chinese People's Volunteers, and that he missed them very much! Grandpa Hong Yi-hyun said: The friendship between our two peoples, forged with blood, will never be forgotten.

During its visits to the Korean Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition Hall, Pyongyang Textile Factory, Huanghai Iron and Steel Works, Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, Bongung Chemical Factory, Chongjin Steel Plant and many other industrial bases, the delegation witnessed the great achievements made by the Korean people under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il Sung in building socialism at high speed. The delegation regarded the achievements of the Korean people as its own, praised them highly, and was deeply moved by the heroic spirit of the Korean people in leaping forward at a thousand-mile horse speed and their bold and creative spirit. The delegation wrote these feelings in the guest books of the factories and the Korean Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition Hall it visited.

The delegation's visit inspired the Korean people's enthusiasm for building the country and their determination to peacefully reunify the country. After the workers of the No. 2 converter of the Chongjin Steel Plant heard that the delegation was going to visit their factory, they decided to make an extra effort to complete the year's production task the day before the delegation arrived at the factory. When the delegation visited the factory on November 9th, they indeed fulfilled their wish the day before.

During its visits to the Korean People's Army troops, the delegation highly praised the achievements of the Korean People's Army in military and political training. The Chinese guests saw the heroic spirit of the brave officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army despising American imperialism, and especially felt the deep friendship of the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army towards the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Every time the delegation visited a troop of the Korean People's Army, it presented the military emblem of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the Korean comrades with excitement. On November 2nd, the delegation, on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, presented the "August 1" military emblem of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the Korean Ministry of National Defence.

Today, huge banners were hung everywhere at Chongjin Station, with the words "Long live the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government headed by Kim Il Sung" and "Long live the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China headed by Mao Zedong."

In order to see off the Chinese guests, the working people, young students and officers and soldiers of the People's Army of Chongjin City gathered in the square in front of the station and on the station platform early in the morning. When the delegation arrived at the station, the welcoming masses held up the bouquets in their hands and cheered "Long live" to the delegation.

A group of children presented flowers containing the feelings of parting of the people of Chongjin to Marshal He Long, Grand General Luo Ruiqing and the members of the delegation. Marshal He Long and others presented "August 1" commemorative badges to the children, and shook their hands cordially, wishing them to grow into good socialist builders.
