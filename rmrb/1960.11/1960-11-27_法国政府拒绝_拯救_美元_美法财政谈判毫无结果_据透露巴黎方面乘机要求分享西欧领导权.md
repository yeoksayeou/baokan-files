Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 25th. Just as in West Germany, US Treasury Secretary Anderson and Under Secretary of State Dillon have met a rebuff in France.

Anderson and Dillon, charged with the mission of forcing Western European countries to help the United States ease its international payments crisis, arrived in Paris on the 23rd and held two days of talks with French Finance Minister Baumgartner and Foreign Minister de Murville.

A UPI dispatch said, "Following the uproar in Germany (West Germany) over the rejection of American proposals, both France and the United States are keeping the details of the outcome of this visit to France secret." Therefore, after the talks, neither side held a press conference to explain the situation to the public, nor did they issue a joint communiqué.

However, it has been revealed that France rejected the US demands on key issues during the talks. UPI quoted "well-informed sources" in Paris as saying that Anderson "did not manage to achieve better results in Paris than in Bonn."

The UPI dispatch revealed that "France, like West Germany, also refused to help the United States' ‘Save the Dollar’ campaign by providing funds for US troops stationed in France." On the issue of increasing France's share of NATO military spending, France stated that this "could only be considered" after the United States agreed to let France share the leadership of the alliance. France is also unwilling to contribute to the US in expanding into underdeveloped countries. According to reports, the two sides only studied the issue of selling more American goods in the French market.

    法国政府拒绝“拯救”美元
    美法财政谈判毫无结果
    据透露巴黎方面乘机要求分享西欧领导权
    新华社巴黎25日电　同在西德一样，美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙在法国也碰了壁。
    负有逼迫西欧国家帮助美国缓和国际支付危机使命的安德逊和狄龙，23日到达巴黎以后同法国财政部长波姆加纳和外交部长德姆维尔进行了两天会谈。
    合众国际社一条消息说，“随着德国（西德）在拒绝美国建议问题上出现的吵吵嚷嚷以后，法国和美国方面对这次访法结果的详细情况都保守秘密”。因此，会谈结束后，双方既没有举行记者招待会向公众说明会谈情况，也没有发表会谈公报。
    但是，据透露，法国在会谈的主要问题方面拒绝了美国的要求。合众国际社引用巴黎“消息灵通人士”的话说，安德逊在巴黎“没有能取得比在波恩好一些的结果”。
    合众国际社这条消息透露，“法国和西德一样也拒绝以提供美国驻法部队费用的办法来帮助美国的
  ‘拯救美元’运动”。在法国增加北大西洋集团军费份额问题上，法国表示，这要到美国同意让法国分享这个集团的领导权以后，“才能考虑这个问题”。在出钱向不发达国家扩张上，法国也不准备为美国作出贡献。据报道，结果双方只是研究了关于在法国市场多卖美国货的问题。
