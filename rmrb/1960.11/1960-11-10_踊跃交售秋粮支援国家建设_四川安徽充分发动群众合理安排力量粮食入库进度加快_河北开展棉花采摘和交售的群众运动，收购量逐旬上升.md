Actively Sell Autumn Grain to Support National Construction
Sichuan and Anhui Fully Mobilize the Masses and Rationally Arrange Labor Force, Accelerating the Progress of Grain Storage
Hebei Launches a Mass Movement to Pick and Sell Cotton, with Procurement Volume Increasing Every Ten Days

(Our newspaper, Chengdu, 9th dispatch) Sichuan is closely integrating autumn plowing and autumn sowing with the active promotion of grain procurement and storage. Forty-four counties across the province have already completed their annual delivery tasks.

This year, before the start of the harvest season for major spring crops, Party committees at all levels in Sichuan made detailed arrangements for grain procurement work. Specialized grain procurement and storage agencies were established from the county to the commune and management district levels, under the personal leadership of Party secretaries at each level. During the procurement process, various localities also conducted policy propaganda and political and ideological education among the masses, quickly launching a high tide of enthusiastic grain sales.

Due to the concentrated inflow of autumn grain into storage, Party committees at all levels paid special attention to properly arranging labor. Grain departments also made early preparations for grain storage work. In Gongxian County, during the process of delivering grain, people's communes used more than 2,000 heated platforms day and night to dry all the harvested grain in order to overcome the threat of overcast and rainy weather. More than 50,000 people were mobilized to rush the transportation of grain into storage, and government cadres and urban residents were also organized to provide full support, ensuring that the grain entered storage quickly and with good quality. According to the experience of carrying out direct transportation in previous years, Wanxian County changed seven storage routes according to the principle of rational flow and set up 30 temporary grain collection points along the transportation routes, which accelerated the progress of storage and saved the county more than 580,000 labor days and 140,000 yuan in transportation costs.

Now, some areas that have completed their procurement tasks are focusing on late autumn crops and vegetable planting and management, further arranging the lives of the masses, and allocating resources to grain processing, transportation, and storage. Some areas with later harvest seasons and remote areas are also strengthening the harvesting and storage of sweet potatoes and late rice in order to complete procurement tasks early.

(Our newspaper, Hefei, 9th dispatch) In Anhui Province, members of rural people's communes are fighting hard in the "three autumns" (autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing) while enthusiastically selling autumn grain, quickly forming a high tide of rapid sales of high-quality autumn grain. The old revolutionary base areas of Yuexi, Jinzhai, Huoshan, and Huaiyuan County in Huaibei have already completed their delivery tasks ahead of schedule.

This year, all parts of the province have grasped the autumn grain procurement work early and tightly. As early as late August, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made comprehensive arrangements for the harvesting, procurement, and distribution of autumn grain. Party committees at all levels have strengthened the leadership of grain management work, with the first secretary taking the lead. In the autumn grain procurement work, all localities have fully publicized and implemented the Party's policies and arranged for the lives of commune members, which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to sell grain to support the country's socialist construction. Jinzhai County organized more than 3,100 cadres to go deep into all parts of the county. They participated in production, carried out various forms of publicity activities, and, based on the principle of taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, promptly formulated distribution plans. While actively completing the procurement tasks, they arranged for rations, seeds, and fodder one by one, so that the policies and tasks met with the masses, and everyone knew what to do. They completed the annual procurement task ahead of schedule on October 15.

Throughout the province, because of the rational arrangement of labor and the planned and organized delivery of grain, "three autumns" production and procurement are closely integrated, promoting each other. In order to ensure that production and procurement are not delayed, Yuexi County determined the focus of work for each period according to the specific situation at different stages: in early September, the focus was on autumn harvesting and procurement, combined with small autumn harvesting and autumn planting preparations; in October, the focus was on autumn planting, while vigorously engaging in manure accumulation and continuing to complete procurement tasks. During the storage climax, the county invested 80,000 laborers in harvesting, threshing, and grain delivery, and extracted more than 9,500 people from the non-agricultural population to support the communes and teams with insufficient labor. At the same time, more than 14,000 people were arranged to carry out small autumn harvesting, and 7,500 people were arranged to carry out autumn planting. This greatly accelerated the progress of procurement and storage, and also ensured the labor needs of small autumn harvesting and autumn planting. After the completion of the procurement task in one go, all 90,000 laborers in the county were invested in autumn plowing, autumn planting, and manure accumulation, so "three autumns" production made rapid progress.

(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 9th dispatch) The mass cotton picking and selling campaign launched by people's communes in Hebei Province has entered a new climax. At present, the province mobilizes more than 1.4 million commune members to pick and transport cotton every day, with more than 30,000 large and small cotton transport vehicles, and the amount of cotton purchased is increasing every ten days. More than 100 cotton processing factories across the province have ginned a batch of lint cotton, most of which has been transported to cotton textile factories across the country.

Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the instruction to "mobilize the whole Party and the whole people to vigorously engage in the procurement campaign of agricultural products," Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province have further strengthened their leadership in cotton picking and procurement. People's communes and production teams have launched red flag competitions for cotton picking and selling. Handan and Baoding have also organized cotton work inspection groups to go deep into key cotton-producing areas to conduct inspections, exchange and promote the experiences of advanced areas in a timely manner, and promote the development of the cotton picking and procurement campaign.

In accordance with the spirit of overall consideration and rational arrangement, the labor arrangement for cotton picking generally adopts the "three combinations" method, that is, the combination of professional teams and part-time teams, the combination of full labor and auxiliary labor, and the combination of regular and rush work, seizing every opportunity to rush to pick cotton. Some areas where wheat planting and sweet potato digging have basically ended have transferred all their labor to the cotton picking front to concentrate on rushing to pick cotton. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the commercial departments have further strengthened their procurement efforts. At present, the number of procurement stations and points set up in the province has increased by 44% compared with September. (Attached picture)

    踊跃交售秋粮支援国家建设
    四川安徽充分发动群众合理安排力量粮食入库进度加快
    河北开展棉花采摘和交售的群众运动，收购量逐旬上升
    本报成都9日电　四川各地紧密结合秋耕、秋种，积极进行粮食征购入库工作。全省已经有四十四个县完成全年交售任务。
    今年，四川大春作物开镰收割以前，各地党委就对粮食征购工作作了细致安排，从县到公社、管理区都建立了粮食征购入库的专门机构，由各级党委书记亲自领导。各地在收购中，还对群众进行了政策宣传和政治思想教育，迅速掀起了踊跃售粮高潮。
    由于大量秋粮集中入库，各地党委特别注意妥善安排劳力，粮食部门对粮食入库工作也及早作了准备。珙县各人民公社在交售粮食的过程中，为战胜阴雨的威胁，全县用二千多个炕，夜以继日地把收下的粮食全部烘干，出动五万多人突击运送粮食入库，还组织了机关干部、城镇居民等全力支援，保证了入库进度快、质量好。万县根据历年来开展直线运输的经验，按照合理流向的原则，改变了七条入库路线，在交通沿线设置临时收粮点三十处，加快了入库进度，并使全县节约劳动日五十八万多个和运费十四万元。
    现在，一些已经完成征购任务的地区正大抓晚秋作物和蔬菜的种、管工作，进一步安排好群众生活，并抽出力量抓粮食加工、调运、保管工作。部分收获季节较晚和一些边远地区，也正在加强红苕、晚稻的收获、入库工作，以便提早完成征购任务。
    本报合肥9日电　安徽省各地农村人民公社社员一面奋战“三秋”，一面踊跃交售秋粮，迅速形成快交售秋粮、交售好粮的高潮。革命老根据地岳西、金寨、霍山和淮北的怀远县已经提前完成交售任务。
    今年全省各地对秋粮征购工作都抓得早，抓得紧。早在8月下旬，中共安徽省委就对秋粮的收获、征购、分配工作作了全面部署。各地党委都由第一书记挂帅，层层加强对粮食管理工作的领导。在秋粮征购工作中，各地都全面宣传贯彻了党的政策，安排了社员生活，因而大大激发了群众交售粮食支援国家社会主义建设的热情。金寨县组织三千一百多名干部深入全县各地，一面参加生产，一面开展多种形式的宣传活动，并在兼顾国家、集体、个人三方面利益的原则下，及时制定了分配方案，在积极完成征购任务同时，将口粮、种子、饲料一一安排落实，使政策、任务同群众见面，人人心中有数，在10月15日就提前完成了全年征购任务。
    全省各地由于合理安排了劳力，有计划有组织地送粮，做到了“三秋”生产和征购紧密结合，互相推动。岳西县为使生产、征购两不误，根据不同阶段具体情况，确定每个时期的工作重点：9月初以秋收、征购为中心，结合进行小秋收和秋种准备；10月份以秋种为中心，同时大搞积肥，继续完成征购任务。在入库高潮中，全县投入收割、脱粒、送粮的劳力达八万人，并从非农业人口中抽出九千五百多人支援劳力不足的社、队。与此同时，还安排了一万四千多人进行小秋收，七千五百多人进行秋种。这样便大大加快了征购入库的进度，同时也保证了小秋收和秋种对劳力的需要。征购任务一鼓作气完成以后，全县九万个劳力全部投入秋耕、秋种、积肥，因而“三秋”生产突飞猛进。
    本报天津9日电　河北省各地人民公社开展的群众性的棉花采摘、交售运动进入新高潮。目前，全省每日出动摘棉、运棉的社员达一百四十多万人，大小运棉车三万多辆，棉花收购量逐旬上升。全省一百多个棉花加工厂已轧制出一批皮棉，其中大部分已运到各地棉纺织厂。
    自从中共中央和国务院发布“全党全民动手大搞农产品收购运动”的指示以后，河北省各级党委进一步加强了对棉花采摘、收购工作的领导。各人民公社、生产队相互开展了采棉售棉的红旗竞赛。邯郸、保定两市还组织了棉花工作检查团，深入各重点产棉区，巡回检查，及时交流推广先进地区的经验，推动棉花采摘收购运动的开展。
    各地根据统筹兼顾、合理安排的精神，在摘棉的劳力安排上，一般采取了“三结合”的办法，即专业队与兼业队相结合，整劳力与辅助劳力相结合，经常与突击相结合，见缝插针，突击采摘。有些种麦、刨薯基本结束的地区，便把全部劳动力转移到摘棉战线，集中突击采摘棉花。商业部门在党委的统一领导下，进一步加强了采购力量。目前全省设立的采购站、点比9月份增加了44％。（附图片）
