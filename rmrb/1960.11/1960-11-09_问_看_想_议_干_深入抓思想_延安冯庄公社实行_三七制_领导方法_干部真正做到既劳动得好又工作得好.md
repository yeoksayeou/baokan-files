    Yan'an Fengzhuang Commune Implements "Three-Seven System" Leadership Method
    Cadres Truly Achieve Both Good Labor and Good Work
    (Our dispatch) Since the Fengzhuang People's Commune in Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, implemented the "Three-Seven System" leadership method, cadres have transformed from burying their heads in work to asking, observing, thinking, discussing, and doing, greatly improving their leadership level. When cadres go deep into the front lines of production, they can promptly discover problems, solve problems, and summarize and promote advanced experiences, truly achieving both good labor and good leadership.
    The "Three-Seven System" leadership method of Fengzhuang Commune began to be implemented in July this year. In general, out of every ten days, seven days are spent going deep into the countryside, eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses; three days are spent on centralized study, inspection, research, and summarizing work. During the busy farming season, the time spent deep in the countryside is changed to about half a month. Although this commune has only been promoting the "Three-Seven System" leadership method for two or three months, the leadership level of the cadres has been significantly improved. In the past, the 27 cadres of this commune who were detached from production had a fine tradition of participating in production. Except for one or two people who remained in the office year-round, more than 90% of the cadres were on the front lines of production, participating in production with the masses. Last year, the average number of days of physical labor for each cadre was 156 days, with the highest reaching 200 days. However, before the implementation of the "Three-Seven System" leadership method, some cadres did not clearly understand the issue of better leading production through participation in production. Therefore, many people worked diligently and conscientiously below for a long time, but did not pay much attention to what problems existed in the production and life of the masses, and how to solve these problems. Some people, although they discovered problems, often lacked solutions due to insufficient centralized study, research, and summarization. Li Juntang, the secretary of the general Party branch of the Kangping Management Area of this commune, used to work very vigorously when he went deep into the Wuzhanggou Production Team, but he had no way to solve the problem that the canteen work of this team was not done well. After the implementation of the "Three-Seven System" leadership method, it was different. The commune cadres not only clarified their thinking that they were both ordinary laborers and leaders, but also spent three days out of every ten days conducting political theory studies, and combining these studies with policy studies, systematically analyzing and studying the actual situation below, so that the things they learned could be quickly applied in practice.
    In late September, when the cadres of Fengzhuang Commune reported on the labor force utilization situation below during the three days of returning to the commune for study, they found that some cadres and commune members of the Chenjiagou Production Team did not have a clear understanding of the idea of ​​concentrating the main labor force to strengthen the agricultural front, and wanted to extract labor to dig cave dwellings. Some commune cadres also did not know exactly what was wrong with this idea. At this time, they used their study time to study the instructions of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Yan'an County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on arranging labor to strengthen the agricultural front, and studied the People's Daily editorial on "Launching a Production Increase and Economy Campaign Centered on Grain and Steel." The thinking of the cadres became clear, and they unanimously said: "If we want to produce more grain, we must put the main labor force into agricultural production. Otherwise, how can grain be produced?" After the meeting, Ren Zhanbao, the secretary of the commune Party committee, went to the Chenjiagou Production Team and conducted education targeted at the specific thinking of the cadres and commune members, so that about 80% of the labor force of this production team was concentrated on the agricultural front. In this way, practice - study - re-practice - re-study, cycling back and forth, the leadership level of the cadres was rapidly improved. The cadres unanimously reflected: "After the implementation of the 'Three-Seven System' leadership method, the mind is clear, the eyes are bright, and there are more methods." When they go deep into the front line of production again, they no longer bury their heads in work with a burst of energy, but instead have doing, asking, observing, thinking, and discussing, constantly discovering and solving major problems in the production and life of the masses, and solving the ideological problems of cadres and commune members related to these major problems.
    Guo Shengkuan, a commune cadre who often could not find solutions to problems in the past, went deep into the Niufengou Production Team of the Second Management Area in late September to participate in autumn sowing. He found that the amount of fertilizer on the wheat fields was much less than the 2,000 jin stipulated by the commune. He first asked the commune members: "Why not apply the full 2,000 jin?" The squad leader replied: There is not enough manure. Is there really not enough manure? He believed that listening alone could not solve the problem, and he had to see for himself to find out the truth. Guo Shengkuan ran to the village and carefully looked at the livestock pens and toilets of each household, and found that two livestock pens and eight toilets could still dig out 20,000 to 30,000 jin of pure fertilizer. Adding some soil fertilizer to these pure fertilizers would be enough to apply the full 2,000 jin. At this time, he further analyzed: Since there is enough fertilizer, why did the squad leader say there was not enough? Is it an ideological problem or are there specific difficulties? In order to get to the bottom of the matter, he went to discuss it with the masses. During the discussion, he learned that the 80 mu of wheat in the distant mountain land of this team had not been fertilized in previous years. This year, nearly 1,000 jin of fertilizer had been applied, and the commune members felt that it was about enough. Some commune members were also concerned that it would be labor-intensive to fertilize the mountain land and distant land, and wanted to save the fertilizer for the river land and nearby land. After discovering this ideological problem, Guo Shengkuan immediately convened a meeting of commune members and conducted education against the erroneous thinking of valuing the river land and nearby land and despising the distant land and mountain land. At the same time, Guo Shengkuan personally took the lead in going down to the manure pit to dig fertilizer and participated in the night battle to deliver fertilizer, so that the 80 mu of distant land and mountain land were fertilized with an average of more than 2,000 jin per mu, ensuring high-quality autumn sowing.
    After the cadres of Fengzhuang Commune adopted the working methods of asking, observing, thinking, discussing, and doing, they were not only able to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, but also learned to summarize experiences. In the past, the cadres of this commune buried themselves in production and had little centralized study and research, so many good experiences were not promoted in a timely manner. The Wanglihe Production Team accumulated a set of experiences in breeding, feeding management, feed storage, disease prevention, and other aspects in the development of the pig-raising industry. The pig-raising industry developed rapidly, with an average of seven pigs raised per household. Ren Zhanbao, the secretary of the commune Party committee, only verbally called on everyone to learn from the pig-raising experience of the Wanglihe Production Team, but did not conduct a systematic summary. Everyone did not know exactly what was good about the pig-raising work of the Wanglihe Production Team, and generally reflected: We can see it, but we can't learn it. After the implementation of the "Three-Seven System" leadership method, Ren Zhanbao went deep into the pig farm of the Wanglihe Production Team and adopted the working methods of one ask, two observe, three think, four discuss, and five do to summarize a complete set of pig-raising experiences. He also held an on-site meeting in this team to make this experience fully blossom. The Fengzhuang Production Team, which originally lagged behind in the pig-raising industry, learned from the experience of the Wanglihe Production Team pig farm. In just one month, the number of live pigs had increased from an average of half a head per household to one and a half heads per household. Recently, the Fengzhuang Commune Party Committee has summarized this working method into the "Five-Character Working Method" of one ask, two observe, three think, four discuss, and five do.
    After the cadres of Fengzhuang Commune established the idea that they are both laborers and leaders, they not only lead better, but also labor better, more, and more conscientiously. Therefore, they can have a deeper understanding of the reality of production, so as to better lead production. This year, the progress and quality of wheat sowing are faster and better than in any previous year, and the area has expanded by more than 20%. Other work has also been done very well. Now, this commune has won the honorary title of "Comprehensive Red Banner Commune" in Yan'an County.

    “问”“看”“想”“议”“干”  深入抓思想
    延安冯庄公社实行“三七制”领导方法
    干部真正做到既劳动得好又工作得好
    本报讯　陕西省延安县冯庄人民公社在实行“三七制”领导方法以后，干部们把闷着头干活变成有问、有看、有想、有议、有干，大大提高了领导水平。干部们在深入生产第一线的时候，都能够及时发现问题，解决问题，总结推广先进经验，真正做到了既劳动得好，又领导得好。
    冯庄公社“三七制”的领导方法，是从今年7月份开始实行的。在一般情况下，是每十天当中，抽出七天时间深入农村，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量；三天时间集中学习、检查、研究、总结工作。农忙时深入农村的时间改为半个月左右。这个公社推行“三七制”领导方法虽然还只两、三个月，但是，干部的领导水平已经获得显著提高。过去这个公社的二十七名脱离生产的干部，从来就有参加生产的优良传统，常年除一、二人留机关外，90％以上的干部都在生产第一线，和群众一起参加生产。去年全体干部每人平均参加体力劳动一百五十六天，最多的达到二百天。但是，在实行“三七制”领导方法以前，有些干部对于通过参加生产，更好地领导生产这一问题认识得不明确，因此，许多人长期在下面踏踏实实，埋头生产，却不大注意群众生产、生活中究竟有些什么问题，怎样解决这些问题；有些人虽然发现了问题，但由于集中学习、研究、总结不够，往往缺少解决问题的办法。这个公社的康平管理区党总支书记李俊堂，过去深入到五丈沟生产队时，劳动得很起劲，可是这个队食堂工作没有搞好，他一直没有办法解决。实行“三七制”领导方法以后就不同了，公社干部不仅明确了自己既是一个普通劳动者，又是领导者的思想，而且每十天当中，有三天时间进行政治理论学习，并结合政策学习，把下面的实际情况作比较系统的分析研究，从而把学到的东西很快在实践中运用。
    9月下旬，冯庄公社的干部，在三天返社学习期间，汇报下面劳动力使用情况时，发现陈家沟生产队部分干部和社员对于集中主要劳动力加强农业战线的思想不够明确，想把劳力抽出来打窑洞。公社有些干部也不知道这种思想究竟错在什么地方。这时，他们利用学习时间，学习了中共陕西省委和中共延安县委有关安排劳力加强农业战线的指示，学习了人民日报关于“开展一个以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动”的社论，干部的思想明确了，一致说：“咱要多打粮食，就得把主要劳力放到农业生产上去，不然，粮食怎出得来？”会后，公社党委书记任占保到陈家沟生产队去，针对干部、社员的具体思想，进行了教育，使这个生产队80％左右的劳力集中到了农业战线上。就这样，实践——学习——再实践——再学习，循环往复，干部的领导水平就得到迅速提高。干部一致反映：“实行‘三七制’领导方法以后，脑子清楚了，眼睛明亮了，办法多了”。他们再深入生产第一线的时候，就不光是一股劲地埋头干活，而是有干，有问，有看，有想，有议，不断地发现并解决群众生产、生活中的重大问题，解决和这些重大问题有关的干部、社员的思想问题。
    过去碰到问题常常找不到解决办法的公社干部郭生宽，9月下旬深入到二管区牛粪沟生产队参加秋播时，发现麦地上肥的数量比社里规定的二千斤要少得多，就首先问社员：“为什么不上足两千斤？”小队长回答说：粪不够了。究竟粪够不够呢？他认为光听不能解决问题，非得亲自去看一看，才能弄清事情真相。郭生宽就跑到村里，仔仔细细看了每一户的畜圈、厕所，发现两个牲口圈和八个厕所内还能挖两、三万斤净肥，这些净肥再加些土肥，完全可以上足两千斤。这时，他就进一步分析：既然肥料够，为什么小队长说不够呢？是思想问题还是有具体困难？为了寻根究底，他又找群众去议论。在议论中，他了解到这个队的八十亩远山地麦子，往年就不上粪，今年上了近千斤肥料，社员就认为差不多了。还有些社员顾虑往山地、远地上粪费劳力，想把粪节约下来给川地、近地上。郭生宽在发现这一思想问题后，立即召开了社员会，针对重视川地、近地，轻视远地、山地的错误思想进行了教育。同时，郭生宽亲自带头下粪坑挖肥，参加夜战送肥，使八十亩远地、山地每亩平均施肥两千斤以上，保证了秋播高质量。
    冯庄公社干部采取了有问、有看、有想、有议、有干的工作方法以后，不仅仅能够及时发现问题，解决问题，还学会了总结经验。过去这个公社的干部由于埋头生产多，集中学习、研究少，许多好经验没有得到及时推广。王立合生产队在发展养猪事业中，积累了一套有关繁殖、喂养管理、饲料储备、防疫等方面的经验，养猪事业发展很快，平均每户养猪七头。公社党委书记任占保只在口头上号召大家学习王立合生产队的养猪经验，没有进行系统的总结，大家不知道王立合生产队的养猪工作究竟好在什么地方，普遍反映：看得到，学不到。在实行“三七制”领导方法以后，任占保深入到王立合生产队养猪场，采取一问、二看、三想、四议、五干的工作方法，总结出了一整套养猪经验。又在这个队召开了现场会议，使这个经验全面开花。原来养猪事业落后的冯庄生产队，学习了王立合生产队养猪场的经验以后，在短短的一个月中，生猪头数已由每户平均半头增至每户一头半。最近，冯庄公社党委已经把这一工作方法总结成：一问、二看、三想、四议、五干的“五字工作法”。
    冯庄公社干部在树立了既是劳动者，又是领导者的思想以后，不仅领导得更好，劳动得也更好、更多、更踏实。因此，对生产实际就能更加深知深解，从而更好地领导生产。今年，小麦播种的进度，质量比以往任何一年都快都好，面积扩大了20％以上，其他工作也都做得很好。现在，这个公社已获得了延安县“全面红旗社”的光荣称号。
