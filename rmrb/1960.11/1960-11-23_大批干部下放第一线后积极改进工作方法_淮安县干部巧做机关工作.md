Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: After a large number of cadres in Huaian County were transferred to the agricultural production front lines, the cadres remaining in the offices launched a competition to "skillfully perform office work," actively improving working methods and increasing work efficiency, achieving a triple harvest of work, study, and labor.

This year, the number of county-level office cadres in Huaian County who were permanently or temporarily transferred to the agricultural production front lines reached 70% of the original number of cadres. The offices became more streamlined, and the tasks of the cadres remaining in the offices also increased. In order to further improve office work with fewer people, the Huaian County Party Committee promptly organized the cadres remaining in the offices to study documents related to improving work style and methods, put forward the slogan of "using brains to think, eyes to see, and hands to do, striving for a great leap forward in office work," and led everyone to launch a competition to "skillfully perform office work." In the competition, cadres in various departments broadly strengthened cooperation within departments and between departments. Leaders should complete tasks themselves whenever possible, rather than asking lower-level cadres to do them; if tasks can be entrusted to cadres working at the grassroots level, there is no need to send specialized personnel down to do them; if one person can strive to complete the work, there is absolutely no need to send a second person to do it.

After the launch of the "skillfully perform office work" competition, not only was it possible to do more with fewer people and to do things well, but also to allow half of the cadres remaining in the offices to take turns working at the grassroots level. Many office cadres actively changed from being passive to being proactive, from being cumbersome to being streamlined, and strived to improve work efficiency. In the past, some office cadres did whatever the leadership instructed, had no plans for their work, and rarely had foresight. Now, they selected representative grassroots units in the suburbs as their base points, spending five days in the office and five days at the base points to participate in production and study production, so that office work was prepared one step ahead of the next, and guidance was timely. Xu Jingzhi, deputy director of the County Agricultural Science Research Institute, when summarizing the experience of high wheat yields this year, set up an agricultural production experimental point in the Ganlu Brigade of Wanyou Commune, and while working, he drafted wheat operation regulations with commune members and grassroots cadres. Three days before the "Autumn Equinox," he planted demonstration plots according to the drafted operation regulations, modifying and finalizing the draft while doing so. As a result, on the day of the "Autumn Equinox," the "Wheat Operation Regulations" were distributed to various communes.

The county's office cadres also actively carried out technical innovation movements with the goal of improving work efficiency and quality. Cadres in the post and telecommunications bureau created automatic newspaper and stamp vending machines and automatic long-distance telephone timers, allowing one person to do the work of five.

Due to the increased work efficiency, cadres had more time for political and cultural studies and participation in labor. Cadres with junior high school education formed study groups for studying Mao Zedong's works according to their departments, and cadres with lower cultural levels studied both politics and culture. In terms of labor, the county-level cadres remaining in the offices completed an average of one mu of rice harvesting and one mu of wheat planting per person during the autumn harvest and planting seasons, totaling more than 6,800 workdays. At the same time, they also used their spare time to plant an average of six li of vegetables per person, achieving self-sufficiency in vegetables.

    大批干部下放第一线后积极改进工作方法
    淮安县干部巧做机关工作
    各个部门干部广泛地加强部门内部、部门与部门之间的协作，凡是领导干部能自己完成的任务，就不叫下级干部去做；能委托下放在基层的干部代做的事，就不派专人下去做；一个人能争取做完的工作，决不再派第二个人去做。
    新华社南京22日电　江苏省淮安县县级机关在大批干部下放到生产第一线以后，留在机关工作的干部开展“巧做机关工作”竞赛，积极改进工作方法，提高工作效率，做到工作、学习、劳动三丰收。
    淮安县级机关今年长期下放和临时下放到农业生产第一线的干部达到原有干部总数的70％，机关更精悍了，留在机关的干部的任务也加重了。为了能够在人少的情况下进一步做好机关工作，中共淮安县委及时组织留在机关的干部学习了有关改进工作作风和工作方法的文件，提出“用脑想、用眼看、用手做，千方百计争取机关工作大跃进”的口号，领导大家开展
  “巧做机关工作”的竞赛。在竞赛中，各个部门干部广泛地加强部门内部、部门与部门之间的协作，凡是领导干部能自己完成的任务，就不叫下级干部去做；能委托下放在基层的干部代做的事，就不派专人下去做；一个人能争取做完的工作，决不再派第二个人去做。
    开展“巧做机关工作”竞赛后，不仅做到了人少多办事、把事情办好，而且还能使留在机关的干部，也有一半人轮流到基层工作。不少机关干部在工作中，积极变被动为主动，变繁琐为精简，努力提高工作效率。过去有的机关干部领导上交代什么干什么，工作没有计划，很少预见性。现在他们选择城郊有代表性的基层单位作基点，每十天中五天在机关工作，五天到基点去参加生产和研究生产，使机关工作在做上一步，就准备好下一步，而且指导工作及时。县农业科学研究所副所长徐竞志，今年总结三麦丰产经验时，在万友公社甘露大队设一个农业生产试验点，一边劳动一边和社员、基层干部一起草拟三麦操作规程，在“秋分”前三天，又按草拟的操作规程种样子田，一面做一面修改定稿。结果在“秋分”那一天，就把“三麦操作规程”发到了各个公社。
    这个县的机关干部还以提高工效、提高工作质量为内容，积极开展技术革新运动。邮电局的干部创造了自动售报、售邮票的柜子和长途电话自动记时器，一个人做了五个人的工作。
    由于提高了工作效率，干部的政治、文化学习和参加劳动的时间也多了。具有初中文化程度的干部，按部门组成了学习毛泽东著作小组，文化水平较低的干部，又学政治又学文化。劳动方面，全县县级留机关干部在秋收秋种中平均每人完成了收一亩稻、种一亩麦的任务，共做劳动日六千八百多个，同时，还利用业余时间每人平均种了六厘地的蔬菜，实现了蔬菜自给。
