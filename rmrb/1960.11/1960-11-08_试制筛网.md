Trial Production of Sieve Mesh

    Open-hearth furnaces are built with refractory bricks, and the quality of the refractory bricks directly affects the life of the furnace.

    The refractory bricks made by the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine Workshop of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are used in the large open-hearth furnaces of the three steel plants of Anshan Iron and Steel. In order to further improve the quality of refractory bricks, they decided to add sieve meshes with uniform mesh sizes. However, after sending people to many places, they could not find suitable sieve meshes for a while. Finally, they found the Lüda Welfare Factory and asked them to make them.

    Making sieve meshes with 3mm thick wire posed many difficulties for the Lüda Welfare Factory. Firstly, they had only trial-produced them in 1958 and had not produced them since. Secondly, the quality requirements for this product were strict, making it difficult to make. When the purchasing agent of the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine Workshop Supply Department explained over the phone the importance of the sieve meshes for the production of Anshan Iron and Steel, the leaders of the Lüda Welfare Factory agreed to this task without the slightest hesitation.

    After several trial productions, the Lüda Welfare Factory finally produced more than one hundred meters of 3mm thick wire sieve mesh for the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine.

    After the ten sieves in the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine Workshop were replaced with new sieve meshes, not only was the product quality improved, but also labor and sieve mesh were saved. More than one hundred tons of magnesite powder were also produced each day. (Article)

    试制筛网
    平炉是耐火砖砌成的，耐火砖质量好坏直接关系到炉子的寿命。
    鞍山钢铁公司大石桥镁矿车间做的耐火砖是给鞍钢三个钢厂大平炉使用的。为了进一步提高耐火砖的质量，他们决定添置网眼规格均匀的筛网。可是派人走了不少地方，一时没有找到合适的筛网。最后，找到旅大福利厂，请他们给代做。
    做三毫米粗线筛网，对旅大福利厂来说有不少困难。一来是他们只在一九五八年试制过，后来再也没有生产；二来这种产品质量要求严格，不好做。当大石桥镁矿车间供应处采购员在电话里说明筛网对鞍钢生产的重要意义以后，旅大福利厂的领导同志连半点犹豫也没有，就把这一任务答应下来。
    旅大福利厂经过几次试制，终于为大石桥镁矿制出了一百多米三毫米粗线筛网。
    大石桥镁矿车间十个筛子换上新筛网以后，不但提高了产品质量，而且省人力，省筛网。每天还多出一百多吨镁石粉。（文）
