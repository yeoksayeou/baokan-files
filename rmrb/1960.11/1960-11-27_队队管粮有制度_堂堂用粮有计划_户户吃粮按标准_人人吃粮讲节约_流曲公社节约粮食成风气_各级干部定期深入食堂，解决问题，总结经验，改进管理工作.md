Liuchu Commune Develops a Grain Conservation Ethos

Cadres at all levels regularly go deep into the canteens to solve problems, summarize experiences, and improve management.

(Reported by our newspaper) The 480 canteens of Liuchu Commune in Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province, conscientiously implement the policy of "setting quotas based on the number of people, assigning targets to households, distributing grain to the canteen, eating with vouchers, and retaining savings for oneself," and universally carry out ideological education on grain conservation, focusing on planned grain consumption and economical grain use, making the canteens better and better. At present, the entire commune has achieved a system for grain management in every team and brigade, a plan for grain use in every dining hall, grain consumption according to standards in every household, and grain conservation by everyone.

The Liuchu Commune canteen is a red flag canteen in Shaanxi Province. The commune's Party committee believes that adhering to planned grain use and economical grain use, based on strengthening political and ideological work, is the key to running the canteen well. In order to make the commune members understand why they should save grain and how to save grain, a large-scale publicity and education campaign for grain conservation was launched throughout the commune. At the same time, the accounts of grain collection, management, and usage were announced to the masses team by team and canteen by canteen, advocating consideration for the overall situation, taking the whole into account, looking at the long term, and focusing on the present. In conjunction with publicity and education, model figures who have consistently adhered to planned grain use were commended, and their advanced experiences were widely introduced.

In order to transform the policy of planned grain use and economical grain use into the conscious behavior of the commune members as soon as possible and effectively, the commune's Party committee repeatedly explained the policy of "setting quotas based on the number of people, assigning targets to households, distributing grain to the canteen, eating with vouchers, and retaining savings for oneself" to the commune members. All canteens in the commune, based on the spirit of this Party policy, formulated annual grain consumption plans and arranged grain consumption on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis. Liu Zicheng, the Party branch secretary of the Huidian No. 1 team, in coordination with the management personnel, after research and discussion, formulated a method of "retaining savings for oneself," stipulating that at the end of each month, the commune members' unconsumed rations should be returned as grain or money. After implementing this method, clever arrangement of meals has become a common practice, and everyone in the team pays attention to grain conservation.

Managing grain well and using grain well is a major aspect of running the canteen well, but to truly ensure that commune members eat enough and eat well, it is also necessary to vigorously engage in the canteen's own production. While focusing on planned grain consumption, the commune's Party committee also firmly grasped the establishment of a non-staple food production base mainly based on vegetables. Commune members were mobilized to use all available wasteland to expand the vegetable planting area. All the canteens in the commune have successively set up small pig farms and chicken farms, canteens in the mountain areas raised sheep, and canteens along lakes and reservoirs also raised fish; each canteen also established small-scale flour mills and soy sauce and vinegar processing plants according to its own specific conditions.

In order to make planned grain use and economical grain use more solid and to arrange the lives of the commune members better, the commune's cadres at all levels, while going deep into the front line of production, also insisted on spending two days a month going deep into the canteen to serve as cooks, in order to familiarize themselves with the situation, understand the demands of the masses, solve problems in a timely manner, and constantly improve management methods. In addition, seventy-three Party organization secretaries and cadres from the commune, management area, and production team were transferred to specifically cultivate typical examples and create experience at fixed points.

    队队管粮有制度　堂堂用粮有计划　户户吃粮按标准　人人吃粮讲节约
    流曲公社节约粮食成风气
    各级干部定期深入食堂，解决问题，总结经验，改进管理工作
    本报讯　陕西铜川市流曲公社四百八十个食堂，认真贯彻“以人定量，指标到户，粮食到堂，凭票吃饭，节约归己”的政策，普遍开展节约粮食的思想教育工作，大抓计划用粮和节约用粮，使食堂越办越好。目前，全社已做到队队管粮有制度，堂堂用粮有计划，户户吃粮按标准，人人吃饭讲节约。
    流曲公社食堂是陕西省红旗食堂。公社党委认为：在加强政治思想工作的基础上，坚持计划用粮、节约用粮是办好食堂的关键。为了使社员知道为什么要节约，怎样才能做到节约，在全社展开了一个声势浩大的节约粮食宣传教育运动。同时，逐队、逐堂向群众公布粮食收、管、用的账目，提倡顾大局、看整体，看长远、抓当前。结合宣传教育，还表扬了一贯严格坚持计划用粮的模范人物，并广泛地介绍了他们的先进经验。
    为了尽快地、有力地把计划用粮、节约用粮的政策变成社员的自觉行为，公社党委又反复向社员交代了“以人定量、指标到户、粮食到堂、凭票吃饭、节约归己”的政策。全社所有食堂都本着党的这一政策精神，制定了全年吃粮计划，并按月、按旬、按天安排吃粮。惠店一小队党支部书记刘子诚协同管理人员，经过研究讨论，制定了“节约归己”的办法，规定：每月月终，社员没有吃完的口粮，要粮给粮，要钱给钱。在实行这个办法后，吃饭巧安排已成了普遍风气，全队人人都注意节约粮食。
    管好粮食、用好粮食，虽然是办好食堂的主要一面，但要真正保证社员吃得饱、吃得好，还必须大搞食堂家底生产。公社党委在大抓计划吃粮的同时，还狠狠地抓住了以蔬菜为主建立副食品生产基地。发动社员利用一切能够利用的荒地，扩大蔬菜种植面积。全社所有食堂，纷纷办起小型猪场、鸡场，沿山一带的食堂养了羊，沿湖、沿水库周围的食堂还养了鱼；各食堂又根据自己的具体情况，建立了小型的磨面加工厂、酱醋加工厂。
    这个公社为了把计划用粮、节约用粮做得更扎实，把社员生活安排得更好，各级干部在深入生产第一线的同时，每月还坚持了用两天时间深入食堂担任炊事员，以便熟悉情况，了解群众要求，及时解决问题，不断改进管理办法。另外，还抽调了七十三名社、管区、生产队的党组织书记和干部，专门定点培养典型、创造经验。
