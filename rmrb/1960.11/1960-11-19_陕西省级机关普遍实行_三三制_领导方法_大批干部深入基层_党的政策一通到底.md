Shaanxi Provincial Organs Universally Implement the "Three-Three System" Leadership Method
	A Large Number of Cadres Go Deep into the Grassroots, Party Policies Penetrate to the Very End
	The "Three-Three System" is: one-third of the cadres are permanently stationed at the grassroots level, one-third regularly go down to conduct巡回 inspections, and one-third remain in the office to work.

	(Based on this report) Under the situation of continuous leaps forward in industry and agriculture, the leadership style and methods of the Shaanxi provincial-level organs have greatly improved. Organs below the county level have universally implemented leadership methods such as the "two-five system" and "three-seven system," and organs above the county level have also sent a large number of cadres to go deep into the grassroots to help and inspect work. Especially during the campaigns of "Strengthening the Agricultural Front in Every Possible Way" and the "Ten Thousand Red Banner Units, Million Red Banner Holders," more than 100,000 cadres across the province, taking outstanding cadres such as Gao Yi as their role models, went to work in the most arduous and difficult areas, further promoting the fine revolutionary traditions of the Party during the Yan'an period throughout the province and strengthening leadership on the front line of agricultural production. To make the leadership of provincial-level organs better adapt to this excellent situation, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently made a decision to universally implement the "Three-Three System" leadership method in provincial-level and prefectural-level (municipal) organs. That is, one-third of the cadres are permanently stationed at the grassroots production units, participating in and leading production under the unified leadership of the local Party committee; another one-third regularly go deep into the grassroots to conduct 巡回 inspections; and one-third remain in the office to handle daily business. In this way, the personnel of the leading organs go deep among the masses and into reality, forming a regular system.

	The staff of various organs have conscientiously studied the Provincial Party Committee's decision, and the cadres' ideological understanding has been universally enhanced. Everyone made guarantees, expressed determination, and applied to be in the first batch to go to the grassroots to be stationed. The staff of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture wrote more than 200 big-character posters, expressing their determination to the Party to respond to the Provincial Party Committee's call with practical actions. The cadres of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, who went deep into the grassroots, unanimously requested to go to the most arduous places, and proposed that after arriving at the grassroots, they would ensure that they would both labor, help the grassroots work, conduct investigations and research, and summarize and promote advanced experiences. At present, more than 1,300 cadres from provincial-level organs have been stationed at the grassroots level, accounting for 34.9% of the total number of cadres in provincial-level organs, including directors of departments and bureaus, division chiefs, and general cadres. Most of them are going to backward communes and teams in remote areas such as Ankang, Yulin, and Yan'an, as well as other weak grassroots units. The cadres stationed there are mostly able to adhere to eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses, publicizing the Party's policies and guidelines to the people, and acting as advisors to the communes and teams, helping grassroots cadres solve practical problems. At the same time, they also require themselves to meet the standards of being good assistants to the Provincial Party Committee and their own work departments, reporting the situation regularly. Currently, more than 1,300 cadres have gone deep into the grassroots to inspect work.

	In the past, due to inconvenient transportation in mountainous and remote areas and the weakness of grassroots leadership, the implementation of Party policies was generally slow. After the cadres stationed and inspecting work went deep into these areas, on the one hand, they organized grassroots cadres to study and conscientiously implement the policies, and on the other hand, they promptly publicized them to the masses, which inserted the Party's policies to the very end, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses and promoting the current agricultural production. Zhang Helin, head of the Commune Operation and Management Section of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee's Agricultural and Forestry Work Department, and others, after arriving at the Yanhewan People's Commune in Yan'an County, cooperated with the county party committee to organize grassroots cadres to establish a system for studying policies, helping local cadres carefully analyze the local situation and recognize the importance of policies, which made the grassroots work show a new and vigorous atmosphere. After the Party's policies were deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the masses' enthusiasm for production was also unprecedentedly high, and the attendance rate and work efficiency quickly improved. Shi Yuxuan, director of the Teaching and Research Section of the Ankang Prefectural Committee Party School, and others, went to the Wenwu Commune in Ankang County to help grassroots cadres actively publicize and implement policies. After the policy of vigorously developing grain production became known to every household, the autumn sowing area was greatly expanded. Xing Xuzhai, a cadre from Xi'an City who was sent down to the Qingfeng Production Team of the Bayuan Commune in the Qinling Mountain area of Lantian County, saw that the production team's canteen was not run well enough, so he actively helped the production team cadres to earnestly implement the policy of grasping production and life with both hands. On the one hand, he explained the policy of "quantifying food according to the number of people, assigning indicators to households, distributing grain to the canteen, eating with tickets, and saving for oneself" to the commune members one by one. On the other hand, he personally served as a cook and administrator in the canteen with the cadres of the team, helped the canteen improve various management systems, and strengthened democratic management to make plans for food use, increase the variety of dishes, and ensure that commune members were well-fed, saving more than 800 catties of grain in a month. This further encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses.

	After the cadres of various business departments were stationed, assisting the local party committees in carrying out the central work not only did not affect the business of their own departments, but promoted the work of the business departments a big step forward. Lv Kerin and other cadres from the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Animal Husbandry went deep into the Zhao Chuan Commune in the mountainous area of Shangnan County. While helping the commune with the autumn harvest and autumn sowing work, they helped the commune members to vigorously collect and ensile livestock feed, collecting corn stalks, valley leaves, and wild grasses that can be used as feed to prepare enough feed for livestock and pigs to survive the winter safely. Combining this with the fertilization of wheat fields, they helped the commune members to do a good job in hygiene and epidemic prevention in pigsties and livestock sheds. Through these specific tasks, he discovered many important issues of universal significance in animal husbandry and reported them to the Department of Animal Husbandry.

	After implementing the "Three-Three System" leadership method, the daily work of the provincial-level organs has also taken on a completely new look. All organs have abolished and merged some institutions, and after implementing joint office work, the layers have been greatly reduced and the work efficiency has been improved. At the same time, due to the timely acquisition of a lot of first-line materials, the leading work has become more practical. (Attached photo)

    陕西省级机关普遍实行“三三制”领导方法
    大批干部深入基层　党的政策一通到底
    “三三制”是：干部中有三分之一固定在基层工作，三分之一经常下去巡回检查工作，三分之一坚持机关工作
    本报讯　陕西省级各机关普遍实行了“三三制”的领导方法。这个制度，保证70％左右的省、专区（市）级机关干部，经常在基层生产单位蹲点和检查工作，及时地把党的政策贯彻到群众中去，把基层工作中的问题和群众的意见反映上来，使省级机关工作更加密切结合实际，联系群众，有效地提高了领导水平。
    在工农业连年跃进的形势下，陕西省各级机关的领导作风和领导方法有了很大改进。县以下的机关普遍实行了“二五制”、“三七制”等领导方法，县以上的机关也派出大量干部深入基层帮助和检查工作。特别是在“千方百计加强农业战线”和“十万红旗单位、百万红旗手”运动中，全省十余万干部以高毅等优秀干部为标兵，纷纷到最艰苦、最困难的地区去工作，使党在延安时期的优良革命传统，在全省进一步地得到发扬，加强了农业生产第一线的领导。为了使省级机关的领导更加适应这种大好形势，中共陕西省委在最近作出决定，在省级和专区以上的机关普遍实行“三三制”的领导方法。即以三分之一的干部固定在基层生产单位蹲点，在当地党委的统一领导下，参加生产、领导生产；另以三分之一的人员经常深入基层巡回检查工作；三分之一的人员在机关处理日常业务，这样领导机关的人员深入群众，深入实际，就形成为一种经常的制度。
    各机关工作人员都认真学习了省委的这一决定，干部们的思想认识普遍提高。人人提保证、表决心、申请第一批到基层去蹲点。陕西省农业厅的工作人员，写了二百多张大字报，向党表示决心以实际行动响应省委的号召。陕西省总工会深入基层的干部，一致要求到最艰苦的地方去，并提出到基层后，保证做到边劳动，边帮助基层工作，边调查研究，边总结推广先进经验。目前，省级机关到基层蹲点的干部已达一千三百多人，占省级机关干部总数的34.9％，其中包括厅长、局长、处长和一般干部。他们大部分是到安康、榆林、延安等边远地区的后进社、队，以及其他薄弱的基层单位。蹲点的干部大都能坚持同群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，向人民群众宣传党的方针政策，并当好社、队的参谋，帮助基层干部具体解决问题。同时，他们还以当好省委和自己工作部门的助手的标准来要求自己，定期汇报情况。目前深入基层检查工作的干部已达一千三百多人。
    过去山区和边远地区由于交通不便，基层领导力量较弱等原因，贯彻党的政策一般较慢，蹲点和检查工作的干部深入这些地区后，一方面组织基层干部学习和认真执行政策，一方面及时向群众宣传，这就把党的方针政策一竿子插到底，大大鼓舞了群众的干劲，推动了当前的农业生产。延安地委农林工作部公社经营管理科科长张和林等，到延安县延河湾人民公社后，就配合县委组织基层干部建立起学习政策的制度，帮助当地干部认真分析地方情况，认识了政策的重要性，使基层工作出现了生气蓬勃的新气象。党的政策深入人心后，群众的生产积极性也空前高涨，出勤率和工作效率很快提高。安康地委党校教研组主任史玉鍹等到安康县文武公社蹲点，帮助基层干部积极宣传和执行政策，大办粮食的方针作到家喻户晓后，使秋播面积扩大了很多。西安市下放到蓝田县秦岭山区坝塬公社青峰生产队蹲点的干部邢旭债，看到生产队的食堂办得不够好，就积极帮助生产队干部切实贯彻执行一手抓生产一手抓生活的政策方针，一面把“以人定量，指标到户，粮食到堂、凭票吃饭、节约归己”的政策一一交代给社员，一面亲自和队里的干部到食堂担任炊事员和管理员，帮助食堂健全各项管理制度，加强民主管理，作到计划用粮，增加了饭菜花样，保证社员吃饱吃好，一个月就节约了八百多斤粮食。进一步鼓舞了群众的生产热情。
    各业务部门的干部蹲点后，协助地方党委搞好中心工作，不仅没有影响本部门的业务，反而把业务部门的工作向前推进了一大步。陕西省畜牧厅干部吕克忍等深入商南县山区的赵川公社，在帮助公社做好秋收、秋播工作的同时，帮助社员大搞牲畜饲料的采集和青贮工作，把玉米秆、谷叶和能作饲料的野草都采集起来，为大家畜和生猪备足了过冬的饲料，以保证这些牲畜安全过冬。他们结合为麦田的施肥工作，帮助社员搞好猪舍、牲口棚的卫生防疫工作。通过这些具体工作，他发现了畜牧工作中许多具有普遍意义的重要问题，并反映给畜牧厅。
    实行“三三制”领导方法以后，省级各机关内部的日常工作面貌，也焕然一新。各机关都撤销、合并了一些机构，实行了合署办公后，大大减少了层次，提高了工作效率。同时由于及时得到了很多第一线的材料，使领导工作更加切合实际。（附图片）
