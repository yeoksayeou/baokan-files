    Sparks of Thought
    In my opinion, working in factories, in rural areas, and in government offices is all for socialism. Since rural areas need more people, why not like the countryside? I believe the prospects for the countryside are very broad. My ambition is to use my labor to change the face of the countryside and create happiness for the people.
    —Lang Xiuyun, Model Commune Member, Yonghua Management Area, Hangjin Houqi, Inner Mongolia

    Revolution always involves difficulties. As long as we take action and work hard, victory lies beyond the difficulties. Faced with difficulties, one person's strength is isolated. As long as there is the leadership of the Party, as long as the masses are mobilized, and everyone is of one heart and one mind, things will be easier to handle.
    —Zhang Xue'e, Deputy Head of Production Team, Qiantangjiang Commune, Haining County, Zhejiang

    There is no good or bad work, as long as the Party needs it, whatever we do is the same, all good, all important, and all glorious.
    —Mi Yuhua, Inseminator, Livestock Breeding Station, Hucun Commune, Taigu County, Shanxi

    思想的火花
    依我看，在工厂、在农村、在机关，都是为社会主义工作。既然农村需要的人更多，为什么不喜欢农村呢？我看农村的前途非常宽广，我的志愿就是用自己的劳动去改变农村面貌，为人民创造幸福。

                                        朗秀云
    要革命总是有困难的，只要动手去干，困难后面就是胜利。在困难面前，一个人力量孤单，只要有党的领导，只要把群众发动起来，人人一条心，一股劲，事情就好办了。
    ——浙江海宁县钱塘江公社生产队副队长　张雪娥
    工作没有好和坏，只要党需要，干什么都一样，都好，都重要，也都光荣。
    ——山西太谷县胡村公社六畜配种站配种员　米玉花
