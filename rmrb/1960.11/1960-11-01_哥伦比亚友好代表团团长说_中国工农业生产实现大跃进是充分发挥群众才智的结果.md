The head of the Colombian Friendship Delegation, Nicolás Buenaventura, and the President of the Colombia-China Friendship Association, Ofelia Uribe de Acuesta, who are currently visiting China, recently spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters about their impressions of their visit to China.

Speaking about his impressions of his visit to China, Buenaventura said that his visit to China made him realize that China was able to achieve the Great Leap Forward because the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government correctly implemented the mass line working method, and the Chinese leaders had a very deep understanding of the people's thoughts and feelings. He said that the reason why China has been able to achieve rapid and enormous development in industry is because the Chinese Communist Party relies on the masses and gives full play to the wisdom of the masses. Thanks to the reliance on the broad masses of peasants, China's agricultural production has achieved a Great Leap Forward. At the same time, the result of the Great Leap Forward in culture is that not only have the broad masses had the opportunity to appreciate music, drama, and poetry, but they have also become creators of music and dance.

    哥伦比亚友好代表团团长说
    中国工农业生产实现大跃进是充分发挥群众才智的结果
    正在我国访问的哥伦比亚友好代表团团长尼古拉斯·布埃纳万徒拉和哥伦比亚中国友好协会主席奥费利阿·乌里培德·阿格斯塔最近向新华社记者畅谈他们的访华观感。
    谈到访问中国的观感时，布埃纳万徒拉说，在中国的参观访问，使他了解到中国所以能实现大跃进，是因为中国共产党和中国政府正确地贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，中国的领导人对人民的思想、感情有着非常深刻的了解。他说，中国所以能够在工业方面取得迅速的、巨大的发展，就是因为中国共产党依靠群众，充分发挥了群众才智的结果。由于依靠了广大农民群众，中国的农业生产获得了大跃进。同时，文化大跃进的结果，不但使广大群众获得欣赏音乐、戏剧、诗歌的机会，而且还成为音乐、舞蹈的创作者。
