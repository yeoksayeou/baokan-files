Hebei's Steel Production Increases Every Ten Days

(Our Tianjin Dispatch, October 31st) The steel front in Hebei Province presents an excellent situation: steel production rises every ten days, and production records are constantly being refreshed. In mid-October, the province's average daily steel output increased by 12.28% compared to the first ten days of the month, and the first nine days of the last ten days of the month increased by another 10% compared to mid-October. The quality of steel has also significantly improved, and pig iron consumption has been greatly reduced.

Since August, the movement to increase production and practice economy on the steel front in Hebei Province has been developing rapidly with the force of a thunderbolt. Production has been rising steadily. Recently, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China called on all steelworkers in the province to seize the favorable season for steel production in October and November, to seize time, grasp speed, and do everything possible to tap production potential and strive for complete victory. From the province to the city, from the factory to the workshop, many secretaries of Party committees at all levels have gone to the front line. Liu Zihou, Wu Yannong, Wan Xiaotang and other secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat went to key steel plants in Tangshan, Tianjin and other places to help further mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, discover problems and solve problems. The first secretaries of the municipal party committees also adopted the method of "division of labor and contracting, one package to the end," going to workshops, groups and furnace platforms to further explain the situation to the masses, hand over tasks, and promote increased production in steel plants. The Provincial Party Committee also organized relevant departments such as the Metallurgical Department and the Coal Administration to establish a system of joint daily office work to strengthen unified command and unified scheduling, and to solve problems in a timely manner. In all steelmaking units, from large steel plants to steelmaking "small foreign groups," Party committee secretaries implemented "three grasps per shift": grasping preparation before the shift, grasping inspection during the shift, and grasping evaluation after the shift. The more meticulous the leading cadres work, the more motivated the workers and masses become.

Long-term planning with short-term arrangements, organizing large-scale high-yield campaigns in a planned and prepared manner, so that production achieves high yield, consolidation, and then high yield, achieving victory after victory and improving step by step, is a distinct feature of the organization of production on the steel front in Hebei Province. Since September, all steel plants in the province have arranged production on a ten-day and daily basis on the basis of monthly plans, implementing them to shifts, groups and furnace platforms; in each ten-day period, there are three days to maintain the high-yield level already achieved, while "accumulating grass and storing grain" and "preparing horses and soldiers," using seven days to organize a large-scale high-yield week. After each high-yield campaign, immediately seize the time to sum up experience, overcome newly exposed weaknesses, consolidate the results, and create conditions for the next large-scale high-yield campaign. This has made production improve rapidly in one wave after another. After overfulfilling the September production plan, Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant mobilized workers to speak out freely, summarizing thirty-four important advanced experiences in high yield, high quality, low consumption, and long life, and quickly promoted them universally; at the same time, according to the problems exposed in the previous high-yield campaign, it improved enterprise management, changing from three grasps per shift to grasping every furnace, grasping at all times, and inspecting and analyzing the production situation of each furnace and every moment. This not only consolidated the achievements already made and boosted morale, but also prepared favorable conditions for the high-yield campaign in October. In the large-scale high-yield campaign in the first ten days of October, the average daily production level of the entire plant increased by 4.63% compared to the last ten days of September. Entering mid-October, the plant Party committee promptly proposed a higher goal than the first ten days, and widely mobilized the masses to propose measures to overcome more than forty production key points. The average daily output in mid-October increased by 5.23% compared to the first ten days, achieving step-by-step improvement and overfulfilling the national plan every ten days.

Steel plants in Hebei Province fully mobilized the masses, focused on weak links, vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, and vigorously promoted advanced experience, which effectively promoted the increase in steel production. For example, the short life of cupola furnaces, low melting rate, and low desulfurization efficiency were major weaknesses of the Tangshan Steel Plant. Since mid-October, cupola furnace workers at the plant have summarized the best tricks of each group in technical performance competitions, summarizing a complete set of advanced experiences such as three-step desulfurization, accelerated masonry repair, and rapid furnace opening. After being promoted throughout the plant, the life of the cupola furnace was extended from more than 80 furnaces to more than 200 furnaces, the desulfurization efficiency increased from 30% to 75%, and the melting rate also increased by more than 20%. After the weak link of the cupola furnace was overcome, the entire plant comprehensively summarized and promoted more than ten major technical innovation experiences created by advanced groups such as Wang Yiyuan, such as steelmaking without baking furnaces and repairing thin furnace linings, with the focus on achieving more opening, fast refining, and high yield of converters, which expanded the converter capacity by 12% to 22%, greatly shortened the blowing time, and increased the average furnace life by more than four furnaces.

    从省到厂党委书记齐上炉前抓高产
    河北钢产量一旬胜一旬
    本报天津31日电　河北省钢铁战线一派大好形势：钢产量旬旬上升，生产纪录不断刷新。10月中旬，全省钢的平均日产量比上旬提高12.28％，下旬的头九天又比中旬提高10％，钢的质量也有显著提高，生铁消耗大幅度降低。
    从8月份以来，河北省钢铁战线上的增产节约运动就以雷霆万钧之势迅猛向前发展，生产节节上升，日前，中共河北省委又号召全省钢铁职工抓紧10月和11月钢铁生产的有利季节，抢时间，抓速度，千方百计挖掘生产潜力，争取全胜。从省到市，从工厂到车间，各级党委许多书记都深入第一线。省委书记处书记刘子厚、吴砚农、万晓塘等分别深入到唐山、天津等地的重点钢厂，帮助进一步发动群众，依靠群众，发现问题，解决问题。各市委第一书记也采取“分工包干，一包到底”的办法，到车间、小组和炉台，进一步向群众讲形势，交任务，推动钢厂增产。省委还组织冶金厅、煤炭管理局等有关部门建立起每日联合办公的制度，加强统一指挥，统一调度，及时解决问题。各炼钢单位，从大钢厂到炼钢“小洋群”，党委书记都实行“一班三抓”：班前抓准备，班中抓检查，班后抓评比。领导干部工作越抓越细，职工群众的干劲越鼓越足。
    长计划短安排，有步骤有准备地组织大面积高产战役，使生产达到高产、巩固、再高产，节节胜利，步步提高，是河北省钢铁战线组织生产的一个鲜明特点。9月份以来，这个省各个炼钢厂都在月计划的基础上，按旬按日安排生产，落实到班、组和炉台；一旬当中，有三天时间，在保持已达到的高产水平的同时，“积草囤粮”，“秣马厉兵”，用七天的时间组织大面积高产周。每次高产战役之后，立即抓紧时间总结经验，克服新暴露出来的薄弱环节，巩固已得成果，并且为下一个大面积高产战役创造条件。这样就使生产一浪高一浪地迅猛提高。天津第三钢厂在超额完成9月份生产计划以后，发动职工大鸣大放，总结出高产、优质、低耗、长寿等方面的三十四项重要先进经验，迅速普遍推广；同时，根据上一个高产战役中暴露出来的问题，改进了企业管理，由一班三抓改为炉炉抓，时时抓，对每炉每时的生产情况都进行检查分析。这样不仅巩固了已得的成绩，鼓舞了士气，并为10月份的高产战役准备了有利条件。在10月上旬的大面积高产战役中，全厂平均日产水平比9月下旬提高了4.63％。进入中旬，厂党委又及时提出了比上旬更高的奋斗目标，并且广泛发动群众提措施，攻破了四十多项生产关键，中旬的平均日产量比上旬又提高了5.23％，作到了步步登高，旬旬超额完成国家计划。
    河北省各钢厂充分发动群众，针对薄弱环节，大闹技术革新和技术革命，大力推广先进经验，有力地促进了钢产量的提高。例如，化铁炉寿命短、溶化率低、脱硫效率低，曾是唐山钢厂的一大薄弱环节。10月中旬以来，这个厂的化铁炉工人在技术表演赛中，把各组最拿手的一招加以归纳，总结成三步脱硫、加速修砌、快速开炉等一整套的先进经验，在全厂推广以后，化铁炉寿命由八十多炉延长到二百多炉，脱硫效率由30％提高到75％，溶化率也提高了20％以上。化铁炉这个薄弱环节攻破以后，全厂又以实现转炉多开、快炼、高产为中心，全面总结推广了王益元等先进小组创造的不烘炉炼钢和修砌薄炉衬等十多项重大技术革新经验，使转炉容量扩大了12％到22％，吹炼时间大大缩短，炉子寿命平均增加四炉多。
