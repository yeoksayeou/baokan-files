    "Endpoint" and "Starting Point"
    Xu Fusen, Worker at Shanghai Zhongxing Bakelite Electric Appliance Factory

    In any work we do, we must have a clear goal and direction for our efforts. Otherwise, if we are clueless and have no idea what we are doing, we will definitely not do a good job. For example, in a race, there must be a clear starting point and endpoint, so that athletes can stride forward, compete with each other, and sprint towards the endpoint at high speed. We must also have a clear starting point and endpoint in our work, so that we can be down-to-earth and consciously move towards the established goal.

    However, we must never absolutize each endpoint. Our work is composed of stages and specific processes, and the endpoint of one stage is the starting point of the next stage, and it will never end. Every endpoint is only relative. For the previous stage, it is the endpoint reached through past efforts. For the next stage, it is a new starting point that guides people to make greater efforts. By constantly pushing forward in this way, our revolutionary and construction undertakings can continue to advance towards new goals.

    Our daily work, daily production, and the work and production of the next day, next month, and next year all have a starting point and an endpoint relationship. For example, we workers engage in labor production, and we have certain production targets every day. The purpose is to create conditions for better completion of monthly and annual production targets. The daily production target is the endpoint of a day's struggle; if we reach this endpoint today, it will be a new starting point tomorrow. For our working class, every endpoint already reached will be the beginning of another new starting point. We must be down-to-earth and seriously treat the starting point and endpoint of each stage, and we will never give up until we reach our goal. Without the victory of a day, a month, a year, or a stage, there will be no victory for the entire socialist construction cause.

    The deepening of the technical revolution movement in our factory also proves this point. Originally, all the presses in the factory were operated manually, which not only resulted in high labor intensity, but also hindered the improvement of labor productivity. In the first half of the year, under the leadership of the Party branch, we launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," targeting the manually operated presses and innovating them into oil pump presses. The implementation of this major innovation project not only freed our press workers from heavy physical labor, but also led to a threefold increase in output and improved quality compared to before. At that time, some people said: "The press workshop has been completely liberated." They thought they had reached the "endpoint" and that there was nothing else to innovate in the future. However, we were not satisfied with the status quo, and with a spirit of never being satisfied, we continued to consolidate, promote, and improve our work, as if we had just tasted the sweetness of the technical revolution. In the current production increase and conservation campaign centered on grain and steel, our press workers have taken the originally successfully innovated oil pump press as a new starting point and transformed the scattered presses into an "assembly line" to implement continuous production; in this way, one person can operate two or three presses instead of one. When we reached this endpoint, we immediately regarded it as a starting point and tried to "attack" the molds for the pressed products, innovating from producing one product per mold to producing two, three, or even more products simultaneously. Finally, we successfully tested a mold that produced up to nineteen products. In this way, the press workshop not only achieved a substantial increase in production, but also saved 10% of the labor force. Now we have put forward new goals and are marching towards full automation. This alternation of starting points and endpoints means continuous development and continuous progress. This vividly illustrates that progress can only be made by breaking the status quo, while complacency blocks the road to advancement. Only by never being satisfied with the status quo can we move forward forever.

    “终点”和“起点”
    上海中兴胶木电器厂工人　徐福森
    我们做任何工作，都得有一个明确的奋斗目标和方向，否则，心中无数，没有个底，就一定做不好工作。譬如赛跑，总要有一个明确的起点和终点，运动员才能迈开大步，互相竞赛，高速度向终点冲刺。我们做工作也得有一个明确的起点和终点，这样，才能脚踏实地，自觉地朝着既定的目标前进。
    但是，决不能把每个终点绝对化起来。我们的工作，是由一个个阶段，一个个具体过程组成的，一个阶段的终点，又是下个阶段的起点，永远不会完结。每一个终点只是从相对意义上来讲的。对前一阶段来讲，是过去经过努力达到的终点，对下一阶段来讲，又是另一个引导人们做出更大努力的新的起点。如此不断推进下去，我们的革命事业、建设事业才能不断地向新的目标前进。
    我们每天的工作，每天的生产和下一天，下一月，下一年的工作和生产，都有一个起点和终点的关系。例如，我们工人从事劳动生产，每天都有一定的生产指标。其目的就是为更好地完成月度、年度生产指标创造条件。一天的生产指标，作为一天奋斗的终点；今天达到了这个终点，到了明天它又是一个新的起点。一切已经到达的终点，对我们工人阶级来讲，都将是另一个新的起点的开始。我们必须脚踏实地，认真地对待每一阶段的起点和终点，不达目的，誓不罢休。没有一天、一月、一年、一个阶段的胜利，也不会有整个社会主义建设事业的胜利。
    我们厂里技术革命运动步步深入的情况也证明了这个道理。原来全厂所有的压机，都是用手工操作的，这样不但劳动强度很高，而且也妨碍了劳动生产率的提高。在上半年度，我们在党支部领导下，开展了以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，针对手工操作的压机“开刀”，把它革新为油泵化压机。这个重大的革新项目实现后，不但使我们压机工人从此摆脱了笨重的体力劳动，而且也促使产量猛增了三倍，质量也比以前提高。当时，有些人说：“压机车间已彻底解放了。”他们认为已到达了
  “终点”，今后再也没啥可以革新了。但是，我们并没有满足于现状，仿佛才尝到技术革命的一点甜头，抱着永不知足的精神，继续进行巩固推广提高工作。在当前开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，我们压机工人把原来革新成功的油泵化压机，又作为一个新的起点，将分散的压机改装为“一条龙”，实行连续化生产；这样，就由原来一人操作一台压机，做到一人操作两台、三台压机。我们到达了这个终点，立即又把它当做起点，设法对压制产品的模具“开刀”，从原来一个模具出一只产品，革新为一个模具同时出两只、三只、以至更多的产品，最后，终于试验成功了一个模具最高出十九只产品。这样，压机车间不但做到大幅度增产，而且还节约了10％的劳动力。现在我们又提出新的奋斗目标，向全盘自动化进军。这种起点和终点的相互交替，就意味着不断发展，不断前进。这正生动地说明了，打破现状才有进步，而安于现状就堵塞了前进的道路。永不满足于现状，才能永远前进。
