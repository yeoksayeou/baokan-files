    Joining the Team Building the Countryside
    Labor Has Brought Me Happiness
    Zhou Zhengming, Family Member of a PLA Officer

    I am the family member of a military officer, and I already have six children; the oldest is thirteen, and the youngest is only three years old.

    When others hear that I have six children, they shake their heads. Sometimes I also feel discouraged, often thinking that I might never be able to work in my whole life. Seeing the country's construction developing day by day, and everyone else having a job, while I am stuck in the small circle of household chores, I feel indescribably uncomfortable. Therefore, I said to my partner that as long as I can participate in socialist construction, I would be happy to do any kind of work.

    At the beginning of last year, I heard that the military unit had established a family members' production team, and I was very happy. I moved my family to the team even before the Spring Festival.

    The first time we went to the fields, we looked at each other and smiled. Everyone was like a bird that had flown out of its cage, extremely happy. But nothing goes smoothly. I had never participated in labor before, and I didn't understand anything about production. The production team was also newly established. We had to do everything: opening up wasteland, digging the ground, carrying manure, and irrigating. After a day of labor, my whole body ached, and I didn't want to get up once I sat down. Once, while turning the soil, I got four big blisters on my hands. When my partner came back, he always encouraged me: "Everything is difficult at the beginning, but you will get used to it slowly."

    In the blink of an eye, a month passed. Everyone elected me as the squad leader. At that time, our team was launching a vigorous Great Leap Forward, and a red flag competition was launched between the three squads. Our squad wanted to win the red flag. Everyone proposed three "quicks" (quick to go to work, quick to get food, quick to eat). As soon as we got to the fields, we buried our heads in work, only hearing the "whoosh, whoosh" sound of turning the soil. At the end of the first evaluation, our squad won first place in plowing the land, digging irrigation ditches, and harvesting soybeans, and we won the red flag.

    In just one year in the production team, I have understood many truths, learned a lot of production knowledge, and my body is also stronger than before. Three of my six children are in the production team's nursery, two are studying in the nearby elementary school, they all eat in the production team's canteen, and one is attending the children's elementary school.

### 劳动给我带来了幸福

    参加建设农村的队伍
    劳动给我带来了幸福
    解放军军官家属　周正明
    我是一个军官家属，已经六个孩子了；大的十三，小的才三岁。
    别人一听说我有六个孩子，就摇头，有时我也很灰心，常想，我恐怕一辈子不能做工作了。眼看着国家建设一天天的发展，别人都有工作，我却被拖在家务琐事的小圈子里，心里有说不出的难受。因此，我就对爱人说，只要参加社会主义建设，不管啥工作，我都乐意。
    去年年初，听说部队成立了家属生产队，心里高兴极了，连春节也没过就将家搬到队里来。
    第一天下地的时候，你望我笑，我望你笑，大家都像飞出笼的鸟儿，非常高兴。可是什么事情都不是顺顺当当的，我过去一直没有参加过劳动，生产上什么也不懂，生产队也刚成立，开荒、挖地、挑粪、放水什么都要干，经过一天劳动，我浑身都疼，坐下就不想起来。有一次翻地时，手上就打了四个大泡。爱人回来总是鼓励我：“什么事情开头总是难，慢慢习惯就好了。”
    转眼的功夫，一个月就过去了。大家选我当分队长。那时，我们队里正掀起了轰轰烈烈的大跃进，三个分队之间展开了红旗竞赛，我们分队都要把红旗夺过来，大家提出三快（出工快、打饭快、吃饭快），一下地就埋着头干，只听“呼呼”翻地的声音。在第一次评比结束时，我们分队获得了翻地、挖水渠、割黄豆三个第一，夺得了红旗。
    仅仅一年的光景，在生产队里，使我明白了很多道理，学到了不少生产知识，身体也比过去结实了。我的六个孩子，三个在生产队托儿所，两个在附近的小学读书，他们都在生产队食堂吃饭，还有一个在子弟小学上学。
