    Forced the Government to Agree to Raise the Wage Standards for Civil Institution Employees
    Brazilian Transportation Workers' Great Strike Ends Victoriously
    World Federation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Saillant Cables Chilean President to Protest Suppression of Workers' Strike
    Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Rio de Janeiro dispatch: The three-day great strike of over one million Brazilian railway workers, sailors, and dockworkers, which began on the 8th, achieved a tremendous victory on the night of the 10th and resumed work today. Under the persistent struggle of the striking workers, the Brazilian government was forced to meet the demands of the strikers and agreed to establish the same wage standards for civil institution employees as for army personnel.
    According to a report from the Latin American News Agency, the various activities undertaken by the Brazilian authorities, such as arresting union leaders and dispatching strikebreakers to sabotage the strike, failed to shake the morale of the strikers. The news agency's reporter pointed out that railway workers participating in the strike had laid down on the tracks to block trains driven by strikebreakers from moving forward. The strikers followed all instructions issued by the strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro.
    This large-scale strike by Brazilian workers had paralyzed Brazil's economic activity. The Latin American News Agency emphasized in its report that this strike was unprecedented in Brazilian history.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 11th: According to a bulletin from the World Federation of Trade Unions published by the local radio station on the 10th, the Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Louis Saillant, sent a telegram to the President of Chile, protesting the Chilean police's suppression of workers and employees who were demonstrating for wage increases.
    In another telegram to Clotario Blest, President of the Chilean Workers' United Center, Saillant stated that the World Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of its 110 million workers, guarantees firm support for the Chilean working class and is convinced that no repression can stop their just demands and struggle.
    Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, November 11th: The Chilean Workers' United Center today submitted a memorandum to Chilean President Alessandri demanding a 38% increase in employee wages. The memorandum also included other economic demands.
    These demands put forward in the memorandum are part of the resolutions made by the council of the United Center after 600,000 Chilean workers held a national general strike on the 7th. This large-scale strike was held to protest the police shooting and killing of two workers participating in a rally demanding wage increases on the 3rd.
    Two similar requests previously submitted by the Chilean Workers' United Center were rejected by the government yesterday.

    迫使政府同意提高民事机构职工工资标准
    巴西交通运输工人大罢工胜利结束
    世界工联书记赛扬致电智利总统抗议镇压工人罢工
    新华社11日讯　里约热内卢消息：8日开始的巴西一百多万铁路工人、海员和码头工人历时三天的大罢工已经在10日深夜获得巨大胜利，并且在今天复工。在罢工工人的坚持斗争下，巴西政府被迫满足罢工者的要求，同意建立民事机构职工和陆军人员同样的工资标准。
    据拉丁美洲通讯社报道，巴西当局所采取的逮捕工会领袖和派遣工贼进行的破坏罢工的各种活动都没有能够动摇罢工者的斗志。这家通讯社的记者指出，参加罢工的铁路工人曾经卧轨来阻挡工贼驾驶的火车前进。罢工者服从设在里约热内卢的领导罢工的总部发出的所有指示。
    巴西工人的这次大规模罢工曾经使巴西的经济活动陷入瘫痪。拉丁美洲通讯社在消息中着重指出，这次罢工是巴西历史上空前未有过的。
    新华社布拉格11日电　据这里的电台10日发表的世界工会联合会的公报说，世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬打电报给智利总统，抗议智利警察镇压工人和雇员为要求增加工资而举行的示威。
    赛扬在另一封打给智利工人统一工会主席克洛塔里奥·布莱斯特的电报中表示，世界工会联合会代表它的一亿零一百万工人保证坚决声援智利工人阶级，并确信，任何镇压都阻挡不了他们正义的要求和斗争。
    新华社圣地亚哥11日电　智利工人统一工会今天把一项要求提高职工工资38％的备忘录交给了智利总统亚历山德里。备忘录中还包括了其它经济要求。
    备忘录中提出的这些要求是统一工会理事会在智利六十万工人于7日举行全国大罢工后做出的决议的一部分，这次大规模罢工是为了抗议警察于3日枪杀两位参加要求增加工资的集会的工人而举行的。
    智利工人统一工会早些时候提出的两项类似的要求昨天遭到政府的拒绝。
