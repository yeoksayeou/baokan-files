    The news of Wang Bincheng's fleet setting sail ahead of schedule to rush-transport ore reached Cheng Jingqing's fleet, which was undergoing ship repairs in the afternoon. Some people said, "This voyage, we're sure to fall behind them."
    "Captain Cheng, we're a model team for guaranteeing the transport of more steel materials, we can't fall behind! Let's set sail immediately and chase after them!" Zhou Haishan suggested.
    "Okay! Chase!" Cheng Jingqing immediately issued the order to set sail.
    The employees of the Sichuan Leshan Prefecture Shipping Company, in order to ensure steel production through transportation and to complete their transportation plans ahead of schedule and above quota, are carrying out a vigorous competition. On this day, the members of Cheng Jingqing's fleet were determined to catch up with Wang Bincheng's fleet. After calculating the distance Wang Bincheng's fleet had traveled in the day and a half since they set sail early, they unanimously decided: reach Yingzui Rock that night, cross the Sandaoguaizi the next day, and resolutely catch up on the third day.
    The evening glow shone on the turbulent Dadu River, sparkling with dazzling golden light. Cheng Jingqing's fleet, on the rolling river, marched mightily towards Yingzui Rock.
    It was already dark, and the boatmen, holding torches, illuminated the towpath and continued to move forward. The riverbank was full of jagged rocks, and the towpath was uneven. Even in the daytime, pulling a boat would make people feel uneasy! But no one thought about these things, only wanting to transport more ore quickly. Along the way, everyone was talking and laughing, and it was extremely lively. An old boatman said cheerfully, "The Dadu River is where our Red Army passed during the 25,000-li Long March. Today, we are fighting on this river, advancing on the road of the Red Army, how exciting!" Zhou Haishan continued, "Comrades, we should show the spirit of the Red Army's crossing of the Dadu River and chase after Wang Bincheng's team!"
    "Right! It's not heroic to not catch up with Wang Bincheng's fleet..."
    The boats parted the torrent, braving the waves forward; the overlapping mountain shadows on both sides receded constantly. One dangerous shoal after another was conquered by them. At eleven o'clock at night, the fleet victoriously reached Yingzui Rock.

    追
    王彬成船队提前开航抢运矿石的消息，下午传到了正在检修船只的程静清船队。有人说：“这次航行一定要落在他们后面了。”
    “程队长，咱们是保证多运钢铁物资的模范队，可不能落在后面呀！马上启航去追吧！”周海山提议。
    “好！追！”程静清立即发出了启航的命令。
    四川乐山专区航运公司的职工们，为了以运保钢，提前超额完成运输计划，正开展着一场轰轰烈烈的对手竞赛。这天，程静清船队的队员们立志要追上王彬成船队，他们计算了王彬成船队提前开航一天半的里程后，一致决定：当晚赶到鹰嘴岩，第二天跨过三倒拐，第三天坚决追上。
    晚霞照射在波涛汹涌的大渡河上，闪烁着耀眼的金光。程静清船队在滚滚的江面上，浩浩荡荡地向鹰嘴岩开进。
    天已黑了，船工们打着火把，照亮纤道，继续前进。河岸上顽石嶙峋，纤道高低不平，就是在白天，拉纤行船，也会使人提心吊胆！可是谁也没有去想过这些，一心只想多运快运矿石。一路上，大家有说有笑，热闹极了。一个老船工爽朗地说道：“大渡河是我们红军二万五千里长征走过的地方，今天我们战斗在这条河上，踏着红军的道路前进，多带劲呵！”周海山接着说道：“伙计们，我们应该拿出红军抢渡大渡河的精神，追赶王彬成队才是呀！”
    “对！追不上王彬成船队不算英雄好汉……”
    船只排开洪流，破浪前进；两岸重重叠叠的山影不断向后退去。一个个险滩恶水被他们征服了。深夜十一点，船队胜利到达了鹰嘴岩。
