Moscow is Expanding

    In August of this year, the Soviet government decided to greatly expand the scope of the capital, Moscow, increasing the original 35,000-plus hectares of jurisdiction to 87,000-plus hectares, and adding 180,000 hectares of protective forest belt around it. This gives the capital Moscow a total area of ​​more than 260,000 hectares. People call the expanded Moscow "Greater Moscow."
    As everyone knows, Moscow's streets are radial, centered on the Kremlin Red Square, with major streets radiating out, becoming wide, flat highways in the suburbs. The main streets run from the city center through a boulevard ring road, through the second Sadovoye ring road, and finally reach the ring road currently under construction. Outside the ring road is a beautiful protective forest belt.
    In recent years, Moscow has devoted itself to municipal construction, especially housing construction, which has been particularly rapid. Before the revolution, Moscow had a total residential area of ​​12 million square meters, most of which were bungalows, and many wooden houses. Now Moscow has a total residential area of ​​46 million square meters. High-rise buildings are everywhere. The newly built residential area in the last five years alone is equal to a Moscow before the revolution. Due to the construction of housing, many new districts have appeared in Moscow. The famous Southwest District, for example, is a completely new area.
    The "Greater Moscow" plan is designed to meet the needs of Moscow's rapid development. The land under the jurisdiction of Moscow has greatly increased, including forests, reservoirs, collective farms, and farms. The number of factories, enterprises, and schools has also increased.
    Moscow will move forward at an even faster pace. The city center area within the Sadovoye ring road will continue to be transformed while maintaining its historically formed characteristics. Streets such as Gorky Street and Kalinin Avenue will be widened to facilitate smooth traffic. The population density in the city center will be greatly reduced. More gardens, fountains, sports fields, and swimming pools will appear in the city center, and some historical buildings will also be fully restored.
    Even so, people are not only longing for the city center, because the residential buildings in the new districts have more convenient facilities. New centers will appear in the newly built suburbs. For example, Lenin Hills will gradually become a bustling center, and many state agencies will gradually move there. The Palace of Soviets built there will be a building comparable to Moscow University.
    The 180,000-hectare protective forest belt will be fully utilized. This forest belt includes the scenic areas of the Moscow suburbs, with reservoirs, ponds, and streams everywhere. Sanatoriums, hospitals, and sports fields will be built in the depths of the dense forests, where the lake and mountain scenery is beautiful. Satellite cities near Moscow will also be built within this forest belt.
    Not only residential buildings, but also municipal transportation, factories and enterprises are expanding to the suburbs. The lines of the Moscow subway are being extended forward. By 1965, more than 60 kilometers of new subway lines will be added. In addition, it is also planned to build elevated railways to connect Moscow's three civil airports, satellite cities, and resort areas. Half of the ring road will be completed this year, and all will be completed next year. This double-lane highway has overpasses and tunnels at intersections with other trunk lines, so cars can travel at high speeds without hindrance. In the next five or six years, there are also plans to build several such ring roads.
    The expanded Moscow has more than six million people. According to the plan, an average of 15 square meters of housing and 18 square meters of green space per person will be gradually achieved. Industrial production, cultural education, and science and art will all develop rapidly.
    The annual revolutionary festival is coming again. Moscow is once again immersed in the joy of the festival. The mood of Muscovites is once again revealing joy and encouragement. The entire Moscow appears magnificent and spectacular, and the construction of Moscow will add splendor to the entire construction of the Soviet Union.

    扩建中的莫斯科
    今年8月，苏联政府决定将首都莫斯科的范围大大加以扩展，将原有的三万五千多公顷的辖地增加到八万七千多公顷，并且增加四周的防护林带十八万公顷。这样首都莫斯科就共有面积二十六万多公顷。人们给扩充后的莫斯科以“大莫斯科”的称号。
    大家知道，莫斯科的街道是辐射式的，以克里姆林宫红场等地为中心，各主要街道辐射出去，在城郊成为宽阔平坦的大公路。主要街道从市中心起穿过一条林荫环行道，穿过第二条沙多沃环行道，最后达到现在正在修建的环行公路。环行公路之外，就是优美的一片防护林带。
    莫斯科近年来特别致力于市政建设，住宅建筑尤其迅速。莫斯科革命前共有住宅面积一千二百万平方米，大部分是平房，木头房也不少。现在莫斯科共有住宅面积四千六百万平方米。高楼大厦比比皆是。仅最近五年内的新建住宅面积就等于革命前的一个莫斯科。由于兴建住宅，莫斯科出现了许多新区。像有名的西南区就完全是新建的区域。
    “大莫斯科”的计划就是为了适应莫斯科的这种迅速发展的需要。划归莫斯科市管辖的土地大大增加了，森林、水库、农庄、农场都有了。工厂企业学校的数目也增多了。
    莫斯科将以更快的步伐向前迈进。沙多沃环行道以内的市中心区将在保持历史形成的特点的条件下，继续进行改造。像高尔基大街、加里宁大街等都将扩大，以便利交通流畅。市中心区的人口密度将要大大降低。中心区将要出现更多的花园、喷泉、运动场、游泳池，而一些历史性建筑也将完全恢复起来。
    虽然如此，人们并不只向往着市中心区，因为新区的住宅建筑有着更多的便利设备。在新建的郊区将出现新的中心。例如列宁山就将逐渐变成热闹中心，许多国家机关都将逐步迁到那里去。那里修建的苏维埃宫，将是一座比美莫斯科大学的建筑。
    占地十八万公顷的防护林带将充分地利用起来。这一林带包括了莫斯科郊区风景优美的地区，水库、池沼、溪流随处都是。在密林深处，湖光水色秀丽的地带将建立疗养院、医院、运动场。莫斯科附近的卫星城也将建筑在这一林带里面。
    不仅住宅建筑，并且市政交通、工厂企业也在向着郊区扩充。莫斯科地下铁路的线路正在向前伸展。到1965年，地下铁道线路将新增六十多公里。除此之外，还准备兴修高架铁道，以联系莫斯科的三个民用机场、卫星城、休养地区。环城公路今年将建成一半，明年全部建成，这一条双线的高级公路和其他干线交岔的地方都有旱桥和隧道，因此汽车可以毫无阻碍地用高速度行驶。在最近五、六年内，还计划修建几条这样的环行公路。
    扩大的莫斯科有六百多万人口。按照计划，将逐渐做到按照人口平均每人将有十五平方米的住宅，十八平方米的绿化地带。工业生产、文化教育、科学艺术都将迅速发展。
    一年一度的革命佳节又降临了。莫斯科又浸浴着节日的欢乐。莫斯科人的心情又流露着欢欣鼓舞的情绪。整个莫斯科显得气象万千，风光壮丽，莫斯科的建设将给苏联整个的建设增添光彩。
