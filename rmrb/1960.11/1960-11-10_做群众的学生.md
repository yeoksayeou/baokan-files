Be a Student of the Masses
Wu Lü

"Only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses." This is a brilliant statement made by Chairman Mao eighteen years ago in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.

The news published in this newspaper on November 2nd about the Kailuan Coal Mine's Zhao Gezhuang Mine organizing more than 1,000 advanced pacesetters to help backward groups talked about this truth. When the advanced pacesetters of the Zhao Gezhuang Mine arrived at the backward groups, they did not " 'dismount from their horses' and immediately start making pronouncements and raising opinions." Instead, they first became students of the masses, listened to the opinions of the masses, and then helped based on the specific situation of the backward groups.

The newsletter "Li Chunhua is a Confidant of the Old Workers," published in this newspaper on October 26th, also talked about this truth. When Li Chunhua was transferred to the Xinhe Coal Mine, he did not " 'dismount from his horse' and immediately start making pronouncements and raising opinions." Instead, he first became a student of the masses, took old workers as his teachers, asked old workers to give lectures, went down the mine with old workers, and when he needed to offer suggestions, he also consulted with the masses.

The cadres of the Xianyang industrial system who serve concurrently as deputy leaders in the production teams reported in today's newspaper also learned from the masses first, so as to better lead the masses.

Aren't advanced pacesetters somewhat better than the masses in backward groups? Isn't the Party committee secretary somewhat better than the average worker? Why can't advanced pacesetters just be teachers when they arrive at backward groups, and leading cadres when they arrive at production groups, and Party committee secretaries leading workers in production, but must first be students?

Yes, generally speaking, since advanced pacesetters have become advanced pacesetters, this means that they are "somewhat better" than the average masses in terms of politics and technology. The Party committee secretary is the helmsman who controls the direction of navigation, and is even "somewhat better" than the average worker. However, regardless of whether they are advanced pacesetters or Party committee secretaries, and no matter how much better they are than the average masses, they "can only be teachers of the masses by being students of the masses." Because being a student of the masses is not a question of whether a person has the virtue of humility; it is the correct attitude towards the masses that the proletarian historical materialism worldview requires of every Communist Party member and every advanced element of the proletariat.

Historical materialism believes that the people are the masters of history, and the revolutionary and productive struggles of the people determine the course of history. Communists want to lead the revolutionary and productive struggles of the people, but this kind of leadership can only be effective if it comes from the masses and returns to the masses, and if it fits the actual situation of the revolutionary and productive struggles of the masses. Therefore, all those who have truly established a proletarian historical materialist worldview, no matter how outstanding their talents are, always regard themselves as students of the masses and rely on the masses to lead the masses. This is a profound reflection of the historical materialist worldview in the mass viewpoint and work style. Only by establishing a historical materialist worldview, having a correct view of the masses, and having an upright work style can we mobilize the strength of the masses and rely on the strength of the masses to do a good job. Why did 60% of the backward groups in the Zhao Gezhuang Mine catch up with the advanced groups in just over a month after more than 1,000 advanced pacesetters went to the backward groups? Why did Li Chunhua, who only studied for one year, grew up in the fields, and had never engaged in industrial production, quickly transform from a complete "layman" into an outstanding expert when he was transferred to the Xinhe Coal Mine? Their most important experience lies here.

As for those who like to make pronouncements and raise opinions as soon as they "dismount from their horses," there are indeed very few of them now. However, there are still some comrades who have remnants of this style. In the minds of these comrades, they think more about themselves as teachers of the masses, rather than wanting to be students of the masses, and they still place themselves above the masses, rather than among the masses. It seems that if these comrades want to improve their work style and do a good job, they still have to start by establishing a historical materialist worldview.

    做群众的学生
    吴滤
      “只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”，这是十八年前毛主席在延安文艺座谈会的讲话中说过的一句至理名言。
    11月2日，本报发表的开滦煤矿赵各庄矿组织一千多名先进标兵到后进小组大帮后进的新闻，谈到了这个道理。赵各庄矿的先进标兵到了后进小组，不是“‘下车伊始’，就哇喇哇喇地发议论，提意见”，而是先做群众的学生，听取群众的意见，然后才根据后进小组的具体情况来进行帮助。
    10月26日，本报发表的“李春华是老工人的知心朋友”的通讯，也谈到了这个道理。李春华调到新河煤矿，也不是“‘下车伊始’，就哇喇哇喇地发议论，提意见”，而是先做群众的学生，拜老工人为师，请老工人上课，跟老工人下井，遇事要出主意时，也是同群众商量着办。
    今天本报报道的咸阳工业系统到生产小组兼任副职的干部，也是先向群众学习，才作到了更好地领导群众。
    先进标兵难道不比后进小组的群众强一些吗？党委书记难道不比一般的工人强一些吗？先进标兵到了后进小组，领导干部到了生产小组，党委书记领导工人生产，为什么不可以只做先生，而要先做学生呢？
    是的，一般说来，先进标兵既然成为先进标兵，这就意味着他在政治上、在技术上，都要比一般群众“强一些”；党委书记是掌握航行方向的舵手，更会比一般工人“强一些”。然而，不管是先进标兵也好，是党委书记也好，也不管他们比一般群众强多少，都“只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”。因为，做群众的学生，这不是哪一个人有没有谦虚的美德的问题；而是无产阶级历史唯物主义的世界观，要求于每一个共产党员、每一个无产阶级的先进分子，都必须具有的对待群众的正确态度。
    历史唯物主义认为人民群众是历史的主人，人民群众的革命斗争和生产斗争决定着历史的进程。共产党人要领导人民群众的革命斗争和生产斗争，但是这种领导只有做到从群众中来又回到群众中去，才能切合群众革命斗争和生产斗争的实际，才能有效地领导这个斗争。因此，一切真正确立了无产阶级历史唯物主义世界观的人，不管他的才能多么出众，总是把自己当做群众的学生，依靠群众来领导群众。这是历史唯物主义世界观在群众观点、工作作风上的深刻的反映。只有确立了历史唯物主义世界观，对待群众有了正确的观点，有了端正的作风，才能把群众的力量调动起来，依靠群众的力量做好工作。为什么赵各庄矿一千多名先进标兵到后进小组只不过一个多月，全矿就有60％的后进小组赶上先进呢？为什么像李春华这样一个只念过一年书，在庄稼地里长大，从来没有搞过工业生产的人，调到新河煤矿很快就由十足的“外行”变成了出色的内行呢？他们的最主要的经验，就在这里。
    至于那种喜欢下车伊始，就发议论，提意见的人，现在确实是很少了。不过，残存着这种作风的同志有还是有的。在这些同志的思想中，想得多的还是自己是群众的先生，而不是要做群众的学生，还是把自己放在群众之上，而不是放在群众之中。看来，这些同志要改进作风，做好工作，还是要从确立历史唯物主义的世界观着手。
