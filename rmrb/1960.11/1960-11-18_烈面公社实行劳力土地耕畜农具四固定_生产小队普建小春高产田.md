Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 17th: The Liemian Commune in Wusheng County, Sichuan Province, has promoted rapid and high-quality spring planting work throughout the commune by establishing high-yield fields in every production team.

In each season of production, the Liemian Commune launches a large-scale high-yield campaign, taking into account the characteristics of the hilly area and with production teams as the basic unit. During the campaign to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, the commune, based on its experience over the past few years, has both expanded the spring planting area by 28% and focused on achieving high yields. The commune party committee, considering the current situation in which a large number of cadres and laborers have been strengthened at the forefront of production, and the "four fixes" system of "fixed" labor, land, draft animals, and farm tools in production teams has been further implemented, decided to further appropriately expand the area of high-yield fields. It requires each production team in the commune to generally plant 30 mu of high-yield wheat, 5 mu of high-yield rapeseed, and 3 mu of high-yield peas and broad beans. All labor, materials, and other necessities for the high-yield fields are to be resolved by the teams themselves. Currently, the commune has planted over 6,900 mu of high-yield fields, accounting for more than 30% of the spring planting area.

In order to effectively help production teams cultivate high-yield fields, the commune has established a high-yield command, the management area has a high-yield command group, and the production team has established a high-yield group. The commune and management area start by focusing on ideology, deeply mobilizing the masses, and helping production teams properly arrange labor and prepare materials. Leading cadres of the commune and management area also select some high-yield fields in the production teams as command fields, and frequently conduct in-depth research to guide the high-yield movement. The commune and management area also provide necessary assistance to the production teams in terms of manpower and material distribution. The high-yield movement has greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in the production teams. Various materials such as fertilizers, tools, and pesticides have been actively prepared and accumulated by the production teams, and were acquired earlier than last year, with natural fertilizer alone increasing by nearly one-fold.

The high-yield movement has also promoted the transformation of production in backward areas. In the past, the ninth management area's cultivation was relatively rough. Recently, due to the establishment of high-yield fields in each production team, the commune party committee has provided specific assistance here, stationed dedicated personnel, and management area and team cadres have also grasped the high-yield fields as a base for commanding production. Now, the technical specifications of various autumn-sown crops in this management area are basically close to those of advanced units.

    烈面公社实行劳力土地耕畜农具四固定
    生产小队普建小春高产田
    新华社成都17日电　四川省武胜县烈面公社以生产小队为单位，队队建立高产田，有力地促进了全社小春播种工作又快又好。
    烈面公社每季生产都按照丘陵区的特点，以生产小队为单位大搞高产运动。在大办农业、大办粮食的运动中，这个公社根据几年来的经验，一方面把小春播种面积扩大了28％，一方面大抓高产。公社党委根据当前大批干部和劳动力加强了生产第一线，生产小队劳力、土地、耕畜、农具“四固定”制度进一步贯彻等情况，决定进一步适当扩大高产田的面积。要求全社每个生产小队一般都要种植三十亩高产小麦、五亩高产油菜和三亩高产豌豆、蚕豆。所有高产田所需的劳力、物资等都由小队自己解决。现在全社已种高产田六千九百多亩，占小春播种面积的30％以上。
    为了切实帮助生产小队种好高产田，公社设有高产指挥部，管理区有高产指挥组，生产小队建立高产小组。公社和管理区从抓思想入手，深入发动群众，帮助生产小队妥善安排劳力和进行物资准备。公社和管理区的领导干部还在生产小队选择部分高产田作为指挥田，经常深入研究，指导高产运动。公社和管理区还从人力和物资分配方面给生产队以必要的帮助。高产运动大大调动了生产小队干部和群众的积极性。肥料、工具和农药等各项物资，由于各生产小队积极筹积，抓的早，都超过了去年，仅自然肥料一项就增加近一倍。
    高产运动还推动了后进地区改变生产面貌。第九管理区过去耕作比较粗糙。最近由于各生产小队高产田的建立，公社党委在这里进行了具体帮助，派驻了专人，管理区和小队干部也都抓住高产田做为指挥生产的基地。现在，这个管理区的各项秋播作物的技术规格已基本接近了先进单位。
