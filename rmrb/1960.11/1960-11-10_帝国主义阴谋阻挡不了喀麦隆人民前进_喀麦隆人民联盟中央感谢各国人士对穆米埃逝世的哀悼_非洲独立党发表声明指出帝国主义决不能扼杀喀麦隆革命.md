Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, November 7th: The Central Committee of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) issued an open letter in Conakry on November 6th, expressing its gratitude to all those individuals, political parties, and organizations who had expressed their condolences on the death of Félix Moumié, Chairman of the UPC.

The letter stated, "We believe that, by expressing such sympathy and solidarity with the Cameroonian revolution, the Cameroonian people and Cameroonian youth can only repay you by remaining steadfastly loyal to the ideals for which our national hero Félix-Roland Moumié sacrificed himself, which is to continue the struggle resolutely and fearlessly so that one day we can shout at Moumié's tomb: The revolution has triumphed!"

The letter especially thanked the members of the Political Bureau of the Democratic Party of Guinea and the members of the Government of the Republic of Guinea, led by President Sékou Touré, who came to the UPC office to express their condolences. The letter also expressed gratitude to the Ambassador and staff of the People's Republic of China, as well as some ambassadors and political parties from other countries, who came to the office to pay their respects.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 8th: In a statement condemning the imperialist murder of Félix Moumié, Chairman of the UPC, the UPC office in Cairo stated today, "The Cameroonian people will continue to struggle by all means, whether legal or illegal, peaceful or non-peaceful, until final victory is achieved."

The statement said, "Indeed, we are living in the most decisive moment in human history, and the balance of power is constantly shifting in favor of peace and progress under the guidance of the powerful Soviet Union and other socialist countries."

The statement pointed out that the dying imperialists do not hesitate to use the most hateful means to prolong their abominable system of rule and exploitation. They either wage colonial wars of conquest, as they have done in Algeria for the past six years, or undermine the unity and independence of other countries under the guise of the United Nations, as they have done in the Congo, or carry out acts of aggression in the name of "peace," as they have done in Cuba.

The statement said that imperialism pretends to recognize the independence of Cameroon, while at the same time, NATO troops equipped with American weapons are slaughtering the old, weak, women, and children, and patriotic people striving for independence in Cameroon every day.

The statement exposed that imperialism is trying to make the Cameroonian people surrender completely and abandon their hatred of all forms of oppression and exploitation. When they encounter popular leaders like Moumié, they do not hesitate to use all kinds of criminal means to eliminate him, hoping to stop and reverse the wheels of history.

The statement emphasized that the Cameroonian people will never retreat, and they will unite closely around the UPC and its lofty goals. They are determined to raise the banner of freedom even higher.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, November 8th: The Central Committee of the African Independence Party issued a statement here on November 6th regarding the death of Félix-Roland Moumié, Chairman of the UPC, stating, "The colonialists' despicable assassination of Félix Moumié once again proves that they are unscrupulous." "But if they think that assassinating Moumié will strangle the Cameroonian revolution, they are miscalculating."

The statement continued, "On September 13, 1958, they assassinated Ruben Um Nyobé, the founder of the UPC, for the same reason. But after Nyobé was assassinated, the revolutionary actions in Cameroon were far from weakened, but were greatly strengthened, and the personnel and firepower of the national liberation army were strengthened."

The statement emphasized that now, Moumié has been despicably assassinated, but the UPC is full of vitality. "The Cameroonian revolution will further demonstrate its vitality and strength."

    帝国主义阴谋阻挡不了喀麦隆人民前进
    喀麦隆人民联盟中央感谢各国人士对穆米埃逝世的哀悼
    非洲独立党发表声明指出帝国主义决不能扼杀喀麦隆革命
    新华社科纳克里7日电　喀麦隆人民联盟中央委员会11月6日在科纳克里发表公开信，向所有对喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·穆米埃的逝世表示哀悼的人士和政党团体表示谢意。
    信件说，“我们认为，承蒙大家这样对喀麦隆革命表示同情和声援，喀麦隆人民和喀麦隆青年，为了向他们表示感激，我们只有坚持不渝地忠于我们的民族英雄费利克斯·罗兰·穆米埃为之献身的理想，那就是坚决而无畏地继续进行斗争，以便有朝一日我们能在穆米埃的墓前高呼：革命胜利了！”
    信件特别向塞古·杜尔总统率领的到喀麦隆人民联盟办事处表示哀悼的几内亚民主党政治局委员和几内亚共和国政府的成员致谢。信件并表示感谢到办事处吊唁的中华人民共和国大使和使馆人员以及其他国家的一些大使和政党团体。
    新华社开罗8日电　喀麦隆人民联盟驻开罗办事处今天在一项谴责帝国主义谋杀喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·穆米埃的声明中说，“喀麦隆人民将用各种方法继续斗争，不管是合法的还是非法的，和平的还是非和平的，直到取得最后胜利为止。”
    声明说，我们确是生活在人类历史上最有决定意义的时刻，力量对比正在以强大的苏联为首的社会主义国家的引导下，不断向有利于和平和进步的方向转变。
    声明指出，穷途末路的帝国主义毫不犹豫地使用最可恨的手段来延续它们的可恶的统治和剥削制度。他们或者进行殖民主义征服战争，像它们过去六年来在阿尔及利亚所作的那样；或者在联合国的掩护下破坏他国的统一和独立，像它们在刚果所做的那样；或者借“和平”的名义进行侵略活动，像它们在古巴所做的那样。
    声明说，帝国主义假装承认喀麦隆的独立，同时，配备着美国武器的北大西洋公约组织的军队天天都在屠杀喀麦隆的老弱妇幼和争取独立的爱国者。
    声明揭露，帝国主义企图要喀麦隆人民完全投降，放弃对各种形式的压迫和剥削的仇恨。当他们遇到如穆米埃这样深得人心的领袖时，他们就毫不犹豫地使用各种犯罪手段来消灭他，希望制止和扭转历史的车轮。
    声明强调说，喀麦隆人民决不后退，他们将紧紧地团结在人民联盟和它的崇高目标的周围。他们决心更高地举起自由的旗帜。
    新华社科纳克里8日电　非洲独立党中央委员会11月6日就喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·罗兰·穆米埃的逝世在这里发表声明说，“殖民主义者卑鄙地暗杀费利克斯·穆米埃，再一次证明了他们是不择手段的。”“可是如果他们以为暗杀穆米埃就能扼杀喀麦隆革命，他们是打错了算盘。”
    声明接着指出，“1958年9月13日，他们出于同样的打算，暗杀了喀麦隆人民联盟的创始人鲁本·乌姆·尼奥布。可是尼奥布被暗杀之后，喀麦隆的革命行动远没有削弱，而是大大加强了，民族解放军的人员和火力都加强了。”
    声明强调说，现在，穆米埃被卑鄙地暗杀了，可是喀麦隆人民联盟生气勃勃。“喀麦隆的革命将更加显示出它的生命力和力量。”
