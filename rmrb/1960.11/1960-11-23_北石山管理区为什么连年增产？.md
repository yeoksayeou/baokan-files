Why Has the Beishishan Management Area Increased Production Year After Year?
	Zang Xin, Da Shan, Huan Dou, Sheng Gui
	The Beishishan Management Area (i.e., production team, basic accounting unit) of the Dongfanghong Commune in Datong City, Shanxi Province, consists of 140 households with 485 people, managing over 6,000 mu of dry, sandy land. In the past, it was a place with very poor production conditions and a very impoverished population. In the five years since the establishment of the agricultural cooperative in 1956 and the communization in 1958, thanks to the correct implementation of the Party's various economic policies in rural areas by the management area's Party branch, good distribution work, and good leadership style of the cadres, output has risen sharply, diversified operations have developed rapidly, and the lives of the commune members have improved step by step. Although this year suffered a severe drought unprecedented in decades, the total grain output can still increase by 3% compared to last year. From 1957 to 1960, the average annual increase was 10%. With the increase in grain production, the amount of marketable grain sold to the state has also increased year by year. The grain sold to the state this year has increased by two times compared to 1956. The grain output has risen sharply, and the total income has also increased rapidly, with an average annual increase of 50% from 1957 to 1960. With the increase in income, the living standards of commune members have also gradually improved. From 1957 to 1960, the average income per person increased by 5%, ensuring that more than 95% of commune members increased their income every year.
	Because production is doing well and the distribution work is excellent, it has powerfully encouraged all commune members to stick to the agricultural front and vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. In the past five years, not only has no commune member blindly flowed out, but the labor force has also increased by 24%, with the young and vigorous force of 18 to 25 years old accounting for more than one-third of the total labor force. Their experience is mainly:
		Increasing Production and Increasing Income
	Production is the basis of distribution. To do a good job in distribution, production must be developed first. The production conditions of the Beishishan Management Area are indeed poor. The 6,000 mu of land cultivated are mostly high in elevation, sandy, windy, and short of water. After the cooperative was established, in order to change the poor state of affairs of "less than sixty jin per mu and frequent droughts and floods with no harvest," the Party branch of the management area conducted a comprehensive plan for land, labor, capital, tools, and leadership, under the premise of giving priority to the development of grain production, and focused on six measures:
	First, vigorously promote high-yield and more harvests, and extensive planting for more harvests. In the past two years, they have led all commune members to build high-yield ridges and reclaimed 734 mu of new wasteland, changing single cropping to intercropping and mixed planting to increase land utilization.
	Second, vigorously promote farmland capital construction. Added 30 mu of irrigated land with double insurance against drought and flood, and 210 mu of flood land. Combined with soil and water conservation, 3,000 mu of slopes and ridges were treated.
	Third, vigorously promote manure accumulation and fertilizer production. Aiming at the local characteristics of many slopes and fertile grass, they vigorously engaged in pig and sheep raising to accumulate manure, built large fertilizer bases, and built manure pits in the fields and near the villages.
	Fourth, vigorously promote good planting and careful management. In order to plant well, they have kept the tillers and sowers fixed since the establishment of the cooperative, thereby cultivating the skills of these commune members, and the field management has become more outstanding.
	Fifth, vigorously promote small team leadership and production responsibility system. The production team leaders and team cadres are all good foremen who are loved by the masses, shrewd, capable, resourceful, and able to work. The responsibility system centered on three guarantees and one reward has been adhered to from the establishment of the cooperative to the present.
	Sixth, vigorously promote diversified operations. The income from diversified operations has increased from 30% of the total income at the time of cooperation to 60% this year.
		Correctly Implement Distribution Policies
	This management area has not only increased public accumulation every year in distribution, but also guaranteed that more than 95% of the commune members increase their income, and also resolutely completed the state tax and purchase tasks. The most prominent thing is that in the past five years, it has truly achieved mutual non-default among commune members, the collective, and the state. No household in the entire management area owes the state or the management area any money, and the management area does not owe the commune members a single penny. The 4,533 yuan borrowed from the bank in the past six years has been fully repaid. With the gradual increase of income, regular pre-distribution of wages and year-end settlement have been implemented.
	The management area conscientiously implements the Party's various economic policies in rural areas and adheres to the three-level ownership system. Under the premise of ensuring collective interests, it also pays great attention to the income that commune members deserve. In handling the economic relationship between commune members and the management area, a reasonable price policy has been adhered to. The manure purchased from commune members and the scrap iron and waste wood used for repairing farm tools are reasonably priced and paid immediately. The livestock, sheep flocks, large farm tools, and trees that commune members valued and returned to the cooperative are all returned in installments as originally scheduled for three years. This has greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members for production.
		Cadres and the Masses Are of One Mind and Stick to the Front
The main characteristics of the leadership style of the cadres are three:
	First, democratic work style, cadres and the masses are of one mind. In the past five years, the Beishishan Management Area has always adhered to the principles of democratic management and thrift. The four good housekeepers, Red Secretary Liang Baoshan, thrifty Director Liang Jinzeng, reliable Accountant Liang Deji, and reassuring Keeper Liang Jinyu, not only are they commanders and fighters in production; but also in abiding by the financial system, they are both spotless and selfless. Not a penny, a grain of rice, a piece of firewood, or an inch of yarn, none of the cadres have ever touched. Since Secretary Liang Baoshan became a cook in June this year, he has not eaten more than a spoonful of vegetables or a bowl of rice. Financial accounts can be announced on time and in detail, and explained clearly, so that commune members can not only understand their personal assets, but also know the assets of the entire area, and the cadres and the masses are of one mind and twisted into a rope. The excellent style of thrift in running the cooperative has been adhered to for five years, and is most prominent in the following three aspects: First, basic construction is simple and crude. At the time of cooperation, the original warehouses, cellars, and livestock pens were mostly collapsed due to disrepair. The management area branch adopted the method of gradually repairing and gradually improving them on the premise of ensuring usability. In the past five years, only 300 yuan in cash and 520 man-days have been spent, accounting for one-twelfth of the funds required for new construction. Second, tap potential in many ways and reasonably reduce production costs. In the past five years, the entire management area has stored 760,000 jin of grass, and in addition to ensuring that the company's forage is surplus, it has also freed up 83,000 jin from the retained grain straw to support the grass-deficient areas, which not only reduced costs, but also increased income by 3,200 yuan. The large and small farm tools and ropes needed by the cooperative are all collected from commune members by means of cash purchases to make their own. In the past five years, a total of 3,960 farm tools have been made, saving 9,200 yuan compared with purchasing new ones. In this way, the production cost and production expenses of the entire management area are inversely proportional to the output and income: the production cost has dropped from 51 yuan per 100 yuan of value created at the time of cooperation to 29 yuan last year; the production expenses have dropped from 38% of the total income to 24% last year. Third, reduce non-production expenses and spend money where it counts. An mimeograph machine costs more than 30 yuan, which is needed and can be afforded, but accountant Liang Deyu painstakingly studied and made one by himself, which did not cost a penny and is no worse than the one purchased. For the above reasons, all 15 cadres above the team leader of the entire management area have not only been re-elected year after year since the establishment of the cooperative, but also this management area has been rated as a "ten-no" red flag management area by the commune, district, and city, namely: no blind outflow of labor; no mildew or concealment of grain; no corruption or petty theft by cadres; no debts within the cooperative; no arrears in transactions; no deaths of livestock; no loss of farm tools; no waste of funds; no errors in accounts; no misappropriation of public funds.
	Second, pay meticulous attention to the lives of commune members. In the process of caring for the lives of commune members, the Party branch has gained a very important experience: the more difficulties commune members have, the more timely help must be given. Therefore, in addition to sending Secretary Liang Baoshan to collective welfare units such as canteens and nurseries to help improve and improve work, the branch pays special attention to helping commune members solve special difficulties in their lives. Single man Liang Baocai's house was broken and he had no place to live. The branch took the initiative to help him and other single men merge their homes; after he had a lover, without him asking, the branch found him a house and helped him establish a happy family. Every cadre is always concerned about the five poor households in the village. Wang Zhongyi has a leg disability, and his family of six is not living well. The branch assigned him to the canteen to pull the bellows, and to accumulate some fertilizer when he has time. He earns 280 workdays per person. In addition to enjoying the supply for the whole family, he also gets 160 yuan in wages, and his life is very comfortable. The other four households also received appropriate care in production, so that they can live happily in the big family of the People's Commune like other commune members. Coal is something that the masses cannot live without every day. The branch always organizes production teams to transport coal centrally during slack farming seasons. Commune members can use it whenever they need it, ensuring their needs. The commune members said: "Living in our village, you don't have to worry about living problems. The cadres think more thoughtfully than themselves."
	Third, care for commune members politically. Their working methods are the five words "participate," "see," "listen," "talk," and "visit." Participate, participate in production, lead production, and be both a commander and a fighter. The average number of workdays done by the 15 cadres above the team leader in the entire management area is not lower than the level of ordinary commune members. Sometimes when work is busy and meetings are late, they still participate in labor the next day like commune members. The commune members are very moved and often advise them to rest. See, see the actions and expressions of the masses in production, and help solve problems in time. Commune member Liang Xinglong has always been active in labor, loves to talk and laugh. In June of this year, he suddenly started to look stern when he met people and was lazy when he went to the fields. After this action and expression was discovered by Secretary Liang Baoshan, he found out during a rest that his sister had asked him to live in Baotou, and he couldn't decide whether to go or not. After help, he raised his understanding and solved the problem. Listen, listen to the reflections of the masses and improve work at any time. Originally, the management area had to invite carpenters, ironsmiths, and ropemakers from other villages to repair farm tools. Later, according to the opinions of the commune members, they trained technicians in the three aspects, who participated in agricultural labor at ordinary times and repaired tools when needed, which greatly saved expenses. Talk, talk to commune members and make friends, and integrate the mood of the cadres with the mood of the commune members. Visit, visit commune members, ask about their well-being. In addition to regular door-to-door visits during the New Year and festivals, they also pay attention to visiting commune members at ordinary times and help solve difficulties in production and life at any time.

    北石山管理区为什么连年增产？
    臧新  达山  焕斗  生贵
    山西大同市东方红公社北石山管理区（即生产队，基本核算单位），共有一百四十户，四百八十五人，经营着六千余亩干旱沙板土地。过去是一个生产条件十分不好，群众生活非常贫困的地方。从1956年成立农业社到1958年公社化以后的五年来，由于管理区党支部正确地贯彻执行了党在农村的各项经济政策，分配工作做得好，干部领导作风好，因而产量直线上升，多种经营飞快发展，社员生活步步提高。今年虽然遭受了几十年来从未有过的大旱灾，但粮食总产量仍可比去年增3％，1957年至1960年的四年中，每年平均递增10％。随着粮食产量的增加，卖给国家的商品粮食也逐年增多，今年卖给国家的粮食比1956年提高两倍。粮食产量直线上升，总收入也飞快增加，1957年至1960年的四年中，每年平均递增50％。随着收入的增加，社员生活水平也逐步提高，1957年至1960年的四年中，每人平均收入增加5％，保证了95％以上社员年年增加收入。
    由于生产搞得好，分配工作抓得出色，有力地鼓舞了全体社员坚守农业阵地，大办农业、大办粮食的积极性。五年来不但没有一个社员盲目外流，而且还增加了24％的劳力，其中十八岁至二十五岁的生力军就占到总劳力的三分之一以上。他们的经验主要是：
          增加产量增加收入
    生产是分配的基础，要搞好分配必先发展生产。北石山管理区的生产条件确实不好，所耕种的六千亩土地，多是地高、沙多、风大、水少。合作化以后，管理区党支部为了改变“亩产不过六十斤，旱涝频繁无收成”的穷苦面貌，并对土地、劳力、资金、工具、领导等，在优先发展粮食生产的前提下，进行了全面规划，狠抓了六条措施：
    一是大抓高产多收与广种多收。去、今两年，领导全体社员大建丰产梁，新开荒地七百三十四亩，变单作为间作混种，提高土地利用率。
    二是大抓农田基本建设。新增旱涝双保险水浇田三十亩，洪水地二百一十亩。结合水土保持，治坡、治梁三千余亩。
    三是大抓积肥造肥。他们针对本地坡多草肥的特点，大搞养猪和养羊积肥，大建肥料基地，田间、村旁普建沤肥坑。
    四是大抓种好精管。为了种好，他们将耕地手和播种手，从建社到现在一直固定没变，从而培养了这些社员的技术，田间管理搞得更为出色。
    五是大抓小队领导和生产责任制度。生产小队长和队干部，都是群众热爱、精明能干、有计谋、能劳动的好领班。以三包一奖为中心的责任制度，从建社起，一直坚持到现在。
    六是大抓多种经营。多种经营的收入由合作化时只占总收入的30％，今年增加到60％。
        正确执行分配政策
    这个管理区在分配上每年既增加了公共积累，又保证了95％以上社员增加收入，也坚决完成了国家税收和统购任务。最突出的是，五年来真正做到了社员、集体、国家三方面互不拖欠。全管理区没有一户社员欠国家和管理区的款，管理区也不欠社员一文。六年来贷过银行的四千五百三十三元款，已全部还清。并随着收入的逐年增加，实行了定期预分工资，年终结算。
    管理区认真执行党在农村的各项经济政策，坚持三级所有制。在保证集体利益的前提下，还十分注意了社员个人应得的收入。在处理社员与管理区的经济关系上，坚持了合理的价格政策。收买社员的肥料和修理农具用的废铁废木，合理作价，当下付款。对社员作价归社的牲畜、羊群、大农具、林木等，按原定三年分期分批归还的期限，全部归还。从而大大调动了广大社员的生产积极性。
        干群一心坚守阵地干部的领导作风主要特点有三：
    一是作风民主，干群一心。五年来，北石山管理区始终坚持了民主办社、勤俭办社的方针。群众所称的红色支书梁宝山、勤俭主任梁进增、保险会计梁德季、放心保管梁进雨四个好管家，他们不仅在生产上既是指挥员，又是战斗员；而且在遵守财务制度上，既一尘不染，又铁面无私。一文钱、一粒米、一根柴、一寸纱，所有干部都没沾过。支书梁宝山，从今年6月当炊事员以来，一杓菜、一碗饭，都没多吃过。财物账目都能按时按项公布，并且交代得一清二楚，使社员既摸清了个人家底，又知道了全区家底，干群一条心，拧成一股绳。勤俭办社的优良作风，五年如一日始终坚持，最突出的表现在以下三个方面：一是基本建设因陋就简。合作化时，原来的仓库、窖子、畜圈，因年久失修大部倒塌，管区支部采取了在保证能用的前提下，逐步整修逐步完善的办法。五年中，只花了三百元现款，五百二十个人工，占新建需款十二分之一。二是多方挖掘潜力，合理降低生产成本。五年中，全管区共打草贮青七十六万斤，除保证了本社饲草有余外，还从扣留的谷草中，腾出八万三千斤，支援了缺草地区，既降低了费用，又增加了三千二百元收入。社里需要的大小农具和绳线，都是靠以现款收买的办法，从社员手中收集废物自制。五年来共自制农具三千九百六十件，比购置新的节省开支九千二百元。这样，全管区的生产成本和生产费用与产量和收入成为反比例：生产成本由合作化时每创造百元价值，需成本五十一元，到去年降低为二十九元；生产费用由原来占总收入的38％，到去年降低到24％。三是缩减非生产开支，钱用在刀刃上。一架油印机三十多元，既需要又买的起，但会计梁德雨苦心钻研自制了一架，没花一文钱不比买的差。由于以上原因，全管区队长以上的十五名干部，从建社以来，不仅年年连选连任，而且这个管理区还被评为社、区、市的“十无”红旗管理区，即：劳力无盲目外流；粮食无霉坏隐瞒；干部无贪污占小便宜；社内无债务；往来无拖欠；牲畜无死亡；农具无损失；资金无浪费；账目无差错；公款无挪用。
    二是无微不至地关心社员生活。党支部在关心社员生活过程中，得出一条十分重要的经验：越是社员有了困难，越要及时帮助。因此，支部除派支书梁宝山深入食堂、托儿所等集体福利单位，帮助改进和提高工作，特别注意帮助社员解决生活上的特殊困难。单身汉梁宝财，自己房子坏了没有住处，支部主动帮助他和其它单身汉并了家；以后他有了爱人，没等他开口，支部又给他找好了房子，帮助他建立了幸福家庭。全村五户困难户，每个干部都时刻关心他们。王忠义一条腿残废，家里六口人，生活不好过，支部便分派他到食堂拉风箱，抽时再积些肥料，一个人赚劳动日二百八十个，除全家享受了供给外，还分到了一百六十元工资，生活过得很宽裕。其他四户也在生产中得到了适当照顾，使他们同其他社员一样，幸福地生活在人民公社的大家庭里。煤是群众日常不能离的东西，支部总是组织生产队利用农闲时间集中运煤，社员什么时候用，什么时候有，保证了需用。社员们说：“住在咱们村，不用担心生活问题，干部们比自己还想得周到。”
    三是从政治上关心社员。他们的工作方法是“参”、“看”、“听”、
  “谈”、“访”五个字。参，参加生产，领导生产，既是指挥员，又是战斗员。全管区十五个队长以上干部，平均所做的劳动日，不低于一般社员水平。有时工作忙了，开会很晚，第二天照例和社员一样参加劳动。社员十分感动，时常劝他们休息。看，在生产中看群众的行动和表情，发现问题及时帮助解决。社员梁兴龙，一贯劳动积极，爱说爱笑，今年6月突然变的见人绷着脸，出地懒洋洋。这种行动和表情被支书梁宝山发现后，休息时一了解，才知道是他姐姐叫他到包头去居住，该去不该去拿不定主意，经过帮助，提高了认识，解决了问题。听，听取群众反映，随时改进工作。原来管区修理农具要请外村的木、铁、绳三种匠人，后来根据社员意见，培养了三方面技术人员，平时参加农业劳动，用时修理，大大节约了开支。谈，和社员谈心、交朋友，把干部的心情和社员的心情融汇在一起。访，访问社员，问寒问暖，他们除过年过节定期登门拜访外，平时也很注意访问社员，随时帮助解决生产和生活上的困难。（附图片）
