	Profound Friendship, Unforgettable Impressions
	Cao Diqiu, Head of the Delegation of the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association

	Recently, the delegation of the Sino-Mongolian Friendship Association, at the invitation of the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association, visited the Mongolian People's Republic to participate in the activities of the Month of Mongolian-Chinese Friendship and to conduct a friendly visit. We arrived in Ulaanbaatar on September 19 and returned to China on October 5. During this period, we participated in the opening ceremony of the Month of Mongolian-Chinese Friendship and the celebration meeting held by people from all walks of life in Ulaanbaatar to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of our country. We also participated in activities such as the opening ceremony of the Chinese Film Week and the Chinese Painting Exhibition, visited Ulaanbaatar and Sukhbaatar, the state-owned farms and cooperatives of the Central Province and Selenge Province, toured industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production and cultural and educational undertakings, and met with some Chinese comrades participating in the socialist construction of Mongolia. Comrade Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, received us. Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed and treated with brotherly enthusiasm by Party and government organs and people from all walks of life, filled with the profound friendship of the Mongolian people towards the Chinese people, leaving us with unforgettable impressions.

	Today is the 36th anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic. Since the victory of the revolution, the Mongolian people have traveled a long way on the road of socialist construction. Whether in cities and villages, industry and agriculture, or other undertakings, tremendous changes have taken place, presenting a new atmosphere. At present, the entire Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, are actively fighting for the building of socialism. Their brilliant achievements are very encouraging.

	Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic named "Red Hero", has become particularly beautiful and magnificent after recent years of construction. Comrade Jiyatay, Deputy Head of the Delegation, had visited Ulaanbaatar twice before 1953. This time, he felt that the city had become almost unrecognizable. The backwardness left over from the old society has largely disappeared, and many new buildings are constantly rising. The Bayanzurh Bridge has been built over the Tuul River; another grand Peace Bridge, 371.5 meters long, spans the middle river and the railway. Many modern factories have been and are being built here. Roads are being widened and constructed. There is a stadium that can accommodate 10,000 people, a youth palace and a children's palace for youth activities, tall buildings, and new-style residences for the working people. The 40,000 square meters of housing built with Soviet assistance and the 50,000 square meters of housing built with Chinese assistance will soon be completed. The eight-story department store is under construction day and night. Ulaanbaatar is under construction everywhere, full of prosperity. It is no longer an ancient city, but a new modern city, and is developing in the direction of a socialist industrial city.

	Modern factories and enterprises did not exist in Mongolia before the victory of the revolution. In the years after the victory of the revolution, the Mongolian people made many efforts to develop industry under extremely difficult conditions. Especially in recent years, modern industry has developed faster. At present, there are 24 large and small factories in Ulaanbaatar alone, with more than 40,000 employees. These factories are equipped with modern technology and equipment. The past handicraft workshops have also been organized and are developing in the direction of modern factories. We visited the leather factory, wool textile factory, flour mill, brick factory, and dairy processing factory in Ulaanbaatar. The biggest feature of these factories is their high degree of mechanization and the large proportion of young workers. Taking the leather factory and the wool textile factory as examples, 60% are young female workers. Most of these young workers have received secondary education. They study very hard and quickly master modern industrial technology. A female worker named Hongba in the wool textile factory, due to her diligent study and hard work, skillfully mastered the operating technology and created a new operating method, becoming an advanced figure in technology. Workers like this are constantly increasing in the industrial sector of the Mongolian People's Republic.

	There has also been a large increase in Mongolian handicraft workers. In the handicraft cooperative, we saw various exquisite handicrafts with Mongolian national style and characteristics, which added a lot of glory to Mongolian arts and crafts.

	Sukhbaatar, the capital of Selenge Province, is the second most developed industrial center in Mongolia. It is accelerating its pace to catch up with Ulaanbaatar. Match factories, paper mills, plywood factories, wooden house structure factories, and flour mills have been established one after another. The technical equipment of these factories is completely comparable to that of factories in Ulaanbaatar. We visited these two cities and deeply felt that under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, modern industry is developing rapidly, the working class is constantly growing, and technical strength is growing rapidly. This has laid a good foundation for the further industrialization of the Mongolian People's Republic.

	Mongolian agriculture and animal husbandry, like industry, are also developing rapidly. There are now 25 state-owned farms and more than 360 cooperatives in the country, and the collectivization of individual herders has been basically completed. We visited the state-owned Dongkhala Farm and Gargalant Farm in the agricultural and pastoral areas. The Dongkhala Farm was established in 1924, and the Gargalant Farm was established in 1927. They have experienced a long time in the development of agriculture and animal husbandry, accumulated a lot of experience, and also absorbed the experience of other socialist countries. In recent years, some state-owned farms have begun to develop in the direction of diversified operations, and have changed from simply planting wheat and potatoes to planting a variety of crops. For example, the Dongkhala Farm is experimenting with planting tomatoes, onions, garlic, yellow tobacco, and hemp, and has achieved good results. In livestock management, in addition to raising horses, cattle, and sheep, they also raise a large number of pigs and chickens. They also pay great attention to cultivating improved varieties, improving business management, and adopting advanced harvesting methods, such as adopting the method of cutting first and then threshing, which greatly saves labor and reduces losses. Through these efforts, the face of agriculture is changing greatly. The director of the Dongkhala Farm told us that they had been losing money for a long time since the establishment of the farm. After vigorous improvement, they began to turn losses into profits in 1959. This year, they can not only complete the national plan, but also greatly over fulfill the plan, hand over more grain to the state, and increase more accumulation for the state. It is precisely because the Mongolian people have found more ways in agricultural development and opened up a broader field that Mongolia's agriculture will surely have further development in the future. When we visited there, it was the busy harvest season. Seeing the farmers happily harvesting and a scene of bumper harvest made us feel very happy.

	Animal husbandry is an important sector of the national economy of the Mongolian People's Republic. It is a very arduous task to transform the nomadic life of herders to settled life. Through the continuous measures taken by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, most of the herders have settled down, which has accelerated the process of agricultural and animal husbandry collectivization. We visited the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Cooperative in the pastoral area. This cooperative is mainly engaged in animal husbandry and now owns more than 70,000 head of various livestock. This year, they have made unremitting efforts to reduce livestock mortality and massively breed livestock, and have made full preparations for massive breeding next year. The newly produced feed alone this year will increase tenfold compared to last year. The director of the cooperative told us with full confidence that he must ensure that the livestock breeding plan is over fulfilled next year.

	The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government have always attached importance to education and cultural work. There are ten universities and colleges in Ulaanbaatar alone, with about 30,000 students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Due to the short period of time, we could not see the full picture of Mongolia's education, but from the two ten-year middle schools and a youth palace we visited, Mongolia's cultural and educational undertakings are developing vigorously. When visiting the ten-year middle school in Gargalant Farm, the principal told us that this school has been designated as an experimental school combining education with productive labor. Students not only cultivate the land themselves, but also participate in the farm's agricultural labor in batches. We visited the wheat and vegetables planted by the students themselves, which grew very well. Because the students participated in labor, not only the quality of teaching has improved, the learning and application are more consistent, and the theory and practice are more closely combined. The students are all striving to be a "five-good" student with good study, good labor, good hygiene, good discipline, and good recreational activities. The principal of this school said with full confidence: They will firmly follow this educational policy and run this school well. We also visited the Fifth Middle School in Ulaanbaatar, which is a very large ten-year school, with more than 2,000 students including night school students. They also attach great importance to the combination of education and productive labor. During the agricultural production season, the school is linked to the cooperative to participate in agricultural labor. In winter, it is linked to the factory to participate in industrial production labor. At the same time, students also cultivate a part of the land themselves. From here, we saw that Mongolia's education has had new developments and is constantly developing on this basis. At the same time, we see that the younger generation is constantly growing up in socialist education and is becoming a new force that is very much needed and indispensable in Mongolia's socialist construction.

	During the short visit, the overall impression left to us is that the Mongolian people, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, have made great achievements in the cause of building their own country. Emerging industries are booming, the collectivized animal husbandry and agriculture are advancing on a new basis, and cultural education is also showing a new look. The Mongolian People's Republic has changed from a purely animal husbandry country to a thriving agricultural and animal husbandry-industrial country. At present, the diligent and brave Mongolian people are accelerating socialist construction and striving to successfully complete the Three-Year Plan. We believe that they will surely achieve new and greater victories on the road to advancement.

	During our visit, we were warmly welcomed and cordially treated everywhere. Whether in factories, rural areas, or in government agencies, schools, or among the broad masses, the atmosphere of brotherly friendship was everywhere. When we visited Sukhbaatar, the capital of Selenge Province, Comrade Rinchin, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, came to meet us at the provincial border 200 kilometers away. Comrade Gaburdoji, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and other responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee also met us 20 kilometers outside Sukhbaatar. When we left, they set out wine and dishes 20 kilometers away according to their traditional customs to bid us farewell. When we visited the Dongkhala and Gargalant Farms, we were warmly welcomed by the farm director, the Party Committee Secretary, and the Mongolian workers and peasants, and treated us with their best things. When we paid a special visit to the Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Cooperative, a welcome meeting was held there, and the herders rode horses from afar to attend the meeting. In these places, we had cordial conversations with Mongolian leaders at all levels. They all praised the great achievements made by our country in the past eleven years and received us with the etiquette of welcoming distinguished guests. In every activity, we felt the deep friendship between the Mongolian people and the Chinese people. The people of our two countries not only forged brotherly feelings in history and in the past war years, but also, we are closely linked together in the process of building socialism, supporting each other and fighting together. We firmly believe that under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, the friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples will surely be increasingly consolidated and developed, and no force in the world can separate us.

	We embarked on our journey home, filled with the deep friendship of the Mongolian people. We sincerely thank the Mongolian Party and government leaders and the Mongolian people for their warm reception, sincerely wish the friendship between the two peoples will last forever, and sincerely wish the Mongolian people new and greater achievements in the cause of building socialism.

    深厚的友谊　难忘的印象
    中蒙友好协会代表团团长　曹荻秋
    最近，中蒙友好协会代表团，应蒙中友好协会邀请，到蒙古人民共和国参加蒙中友好旬活动，并进行友好访问。我们于9月19日到达乌兰巴托，10月5日回国。在这个期间，我们参加了蒙中友好旬的开幕式和乌兰巴托市各界人民为我国成立十一周年举行的庆祝大会，参加了中国电影周和中国画展开幕式等活动，访问了乌兰巴托和苏赫巴托两个城市，访问了中央省和色楞格省的国营农场和合作社，参观了工农牧业生产和文化教育事业，会见了一部分参加蒙古社会主义建设的中国同志。蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔同志接见了我们。我们所到之处，都受到党政机关和各界人民的热烈欢迎和兄弟般的热情接待，到处洋溢着蒙古人民对中国人民的深厚友谊，给我们留下了难忘的印象。
    今天是蒙古人民共和国成立三十六年纪念日。革命胜利后，蒙古人民在社会主义建设的道路上已经走了很长一段路程，不管城市和乡村，工业和农业，以及其他各项事业，都已经起了巨大的变化，呈现出一片新的气象。目前蒙古人民共和国全体人民，正在蒙古人民革命党和政府的领导下，积极为建成社会主义而斗争。他们获得的光辉成就，十分令人鼓舞。
    以“红色英雄”命名的蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴托，经过最近几年的建设，变得格外美丽壮观了。代表团副团长吉雅泰同志，在1953年前曾两次到过乌兰巴托，这次再访，感到这个城市已变得几乎不认识了。旧社会遗留下来的落后面貌已大部消逝，许多新的建筑物正在不断兴起。图拉河上建起了白音祖尔大桥；另一座长达三百七十一点五米的和平大桥，宏伟地横跨在中河和铁路之上。这里已经兴建了和正在兴建着许多现代化的工厂。一条条马路正在拓宽和修筑。这里有可容万人的体育馆，有供青少年活动的青年宫和少年宫，有一幢幢高大的楼房，有供劳动人民居住的新式住宅。苏联帮助建设的四万平方米和我国帮助建设的五万平方米住宅，不久都将竣工。高达八层的百货大楼正在日夜施工建设。乌兰巴托到处在建设，到处充满了繁荣景象。它已经不是一座古老的城市，而是一座新型的现代化规模的城市，并且正在向社会主义工业城市的方向发展。
    现代化的工厂、企业，在革命胜利前的蒙古是没有的。在革命胜利后的年代里，蒙古人民在极端困难的条件下，为发展工业作了许多努力。特别是最近几年，现代化工业有了更快的发展。目前，仅乌兰巴托市就已有大小工厂二十四家，职工四万多人。这些工厂都是用现代化技术设备装备起来的。过去的手工业作坊，也已经组织起来，正在向现代化工厂的方向发展。我们在乌兰巴托参观了皮革厂、毛纺厂、面粉厂、砖瓦厂、乳品加工厂，这些工厂最大的特点是机械化程度高，青年工人的比重很大。以皮革厂和毛纺厂为例，60％是青年女工。这些青年工人大都受过中等学校教育，他们学习十分努力，很快就掌握了现代工业技术。毛纺厂有一位名叫洪巴的女工，由于勤学苦练，熟练地掌握了操作技术，并创造了一种新的操作方法，成为技术上的一位先进人物。像这样的工人，在蒙古人民共和国的工业部门，正在不断增多起来。
    蒙古的手工艺工人也有较大的增长。我们在手工业联社看到了各种各样的精美的具有蒙古民族风格和特色的手工艺品，这为蒙古工艺美术增加了不少光采。
    色楞格省省会苏赫巴托，是蒙古目前工业较发达的第二个中心。它正在加快步伐追赶着乌兰巴托。火柴厂、造纸厂、胶合板厂、木屋结构厂、面粉厂一个一个地建立了起来。这些厂的技术装备，完全可以与乌兰巴托的工厂媲美。我们参观访问了这两个城市，深切感到蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党和政府的领导下，现代化工业正在迅速发展，工人阶级队伍正在不断壮大，技术力量正在飞速成长。这就为蒙古人民共和国的进一步工业化打下了良好的基础。
    蒙古的农牧业，和工业一样也在迅速发展。现在全国已有二十五个国营农场和三百六十多个合作社，个体牧民的合作化已基本完成。我们到农牧区去参观访问了国营东哈拉农场和加尔格朗图农场。东哈拉农场是1924年建立的，加尔格朗图农场是1927年建立的，它们在农牧业的发展上已经经历了很长的时间，积累了不少的经验，也吸取了其他社会主义国家的经验。近年来一部分国营农场开始向多种经营方向发展，已经由过去的单纯种植麦子、土豆变为种植多种作物。如东哈拉农场正在试验种植西红柿、洋葱、大蒜、黄烟和大麻，并且获得了很好的效果。在畜牧业经营上，除饲养马、牛、羊而外，还大量饲养了猪、鸡。他们还十分注意培育良种，改善经营管理，采用先进的收割方法，如采用先割后打法，大大节约了劳动力，减少了损耗。经过这些努力，农业的面貌正在大大改变。东哈拉农场的场长告诉我们，他们建场以来，长时间都有亏损，经过大力改进，从1959年开始转亏为盈，今年不仅可以完成国家计划，而且可以大大超额完成计划，上交给国家更多的粮食，为国家增加更多的积累。正是由于蒙古人民已经在农业发展上找到了更多的门路，开辟了更广阔的园地，因此蒙古的农业今后一定会有进一步的发展。我们到那里访问的时候，正是收割繁忙时节，看到农民们兴高采烈地进行收割，一片丰收景象，使我们感到非常高兴。
    牧业是蒙古人民共和国国民经济的一个重要部门。使牧民们从游牧生活转到定居是一项非常艰巨的工作。经过蒙古人民革命党和政府不断采取措施，已经使大部牧民定居了下来，这就加快了农牧业合作化的过程。我们在牧区访问了蒙中友谊社。这个社是以牧业为主的合作社，现拥有各种牲畜七万多头。今年他们为减少牲畜死亡和大量繁殖作了不懈的努力，并为明年的大量繁殖作了充分的准备工作，仅饲料一项今年新生产的就将比去年增加十倍。这个社的社长满怀信心地告诉我们，明年一定要保证超额完成牲畜增殖计划。
    蒙古人民革命党和政府一直重视教育文化工作，仅乌兰巴托就有大专学校十所，大、中、小学学生约三万多人。由于时间过短，我们不能看到蒙古教育事业的全貌，但从我们参观的两个十年制中学和一个少年宫看来，蒙古的文化教育事业正在欣欣向荣地发展着。在加尔格朗图农场十年制中学参观的时候，校长告诉我们，这个学校已确定为教育与生产劳动相结合的实验学校。学生们不但自己种地，而且还分批参加农场的农业劳动。我们参观了学生们自己种植的麦子和蔬菜，生长得非常好。由于学生参加了劳动，不仅教学质量提高了，学用更加一致了，理论和实践更加密切结合了。学生们都在为争取作一个学习好、劳动好、卫生好、纪律好、文娱活动好的“五好”学生而努力。这个学校的校长信心百倍地说：他们将坚定地按照这样的教育方针，办好这个学校。我们还参观了乌兰巴托市的第五中学，这是一个规模很大的十年制学校，加上夜校共有二千多学生。他们也很重视教育与生产劳动相结合，在农业生产季节，学校与合作社挂钩参加农业劳动，冬天与工厂挂钩参加工业生产劳动，同时学生也自己耕种一部分土地。从这里，我们看到蒙古的教育已经有了新的发展，并且正在这个基础上不断向前发展。同时，我们看到年青一代正在社会主义教育中不断成长起来，成为蒙古社会主义建设中十分需要的、不可缺少的一支新生力量。
    在短短的参观访问期间，留给我们的总的印象是：蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党和政府的领导下，在建设自己祖国的事业中取得了巨大的成就。新兴工业正在蓬勃发展，已经实现合作化的畜牧业和农业正在新的基础上前进，文化教育也呈现出新的景象。蒙古人民共和国已经从过去的单纯的畜牧业国家，变成了欣欣向荣的农牧业—工业国家。目前勤劳勇敢的蒙古人民正在加速社会主义建设，为胜利完成三年计划而奋斗。我们相信，他们在前进的道路上一定会取得新的更大的胜利。
    我们在参观访问过程中，到处受到热烈的欢迎和亲切的款待。不管在工厂、农村，不管在机关、学校，在广大群众之中，到处都充满了兄弟般的友谊气氛。当我们到色楞格省省会苏赫巴托访问时，省委书记处书记仁亲同志，到二百公里以外的省界来迎候我们，省委第一书记加布尔道尔吉同志和其他省委负责同志，也都在苏赫巴托二十公里外迎接我们。在离别的时候，他们又在二十公里以外按照他们的传统习惯，摆开酒肴为我们饯别。我们在东哈拉和加尔格朗图农场访问时，受到场长和党委书记及蒙古工农兄弟的热情欢迎，并用他们最好的东西来款待我们。当我们专程访问蒙中友谊社时，那里召开了欢迎大会，牧民们从老远的地方骑马来参加大会。在这些地方，我们都和蒙古的各级领导同志进行了亲切的交谈，他们都一致赞扬我国十一年来所取得的伟大成就，以迎接贵宾的礼节接待我们。在每一个活动中，我们都感到蒙古人民和中国人民之间的深厚的友谊，我们两国人民，不仅在历史上和在过去的战争年代里结下了手足之情，同样，我们在建设社会主义的过程中，紧密地联结在一起，互相支援，共同奋斗。我们坚定地相信，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，中蒙两国人民的友谊，必将日益巩固和发展，世界上没有任何力量能把我们分开。
    我们满载着蒙古人民的深情厚谊登上归途。我们衷心地感谢蒙古党政领导人和蒙古人民对我们的盛情接待，衷心地祝愿两国人民的友谊万古长青，衷心地祝愿蒙古人民在建设社会主义的事业中取得新的更大的成就。
