"The Countryside is Our Good Classroom"
By our reporter, Fu Jun

    The harvest season has arrived, and the boundless fields are all golden seas of rice. Students from Beijing Agricultural University, together with the owners of the rice paddies – the members of the Huangcun Commune in Daxing County, a suburb of Beijing – seeing the area's historically unprecedented bumper harvest, could not help but sing as they busily reaped and threshed:

    The harvest field is full of joy,
    Alkali and sandy depressions transformed into granaries.
    Chairman Mao and the Communist Party,
    Are our own dear parents.

    This area was a notorious "toad hollow" plagued by floods nine years out of ten, with poor soil quality. Since the spring of this year, the commune members have worked hard, going through a struggle to "dig out the roots of poverty and plant the roots of wealth" from nature, finally transforming large areas of saline-alkali land into rice paddies, which are now yielding a bumper harvest.

    The First Test
    In early March, more than 200 first, third, and fourth-year students from Beijing Agricultural University, led by their teachers, set foot on this vast "virgin land" and came to the Huangcun, Caiyu, and Anding People's Communes in this area to participate in this battle to transform nature. In the early spring days, the north wind howled, the cold was biting, and the earth was frozen stiff. The students shouted "Declare war on the earth, demand grain from nature" as they dug canals and built ridges to create rice paddies together with the commune members.

    During a break, an old commune member, Li Jincheng, asked the students, "Aren't you afraid of hardship, digging canals and building ridges in such cold weather?"

    The students replied in unison, "No!"

    Li Jincheng said with a smile, "That's good. It takes effort to climb a tree, and we are revolutionizing nature, so how can it not be hard? The road to happiness must be paved by ourselves."

    Hearing these words and seeing the commune members' heroic spirit of despising difficulties and conquering nature, the students were filled with a hundredfold energy and worked just as well as the commune members.

    The battle to develop rice paddies was underway. One day, the task was to block a more than two-丈 (approximately 6.6 meters) wide gap in the Dalong River. More than two hundred commune members and students gathered on the riverbank, filling the gap with soil basket by basket. However, the rushing torrent quickly washed away the soil that was dumped in. At this critical moment, commune member Sun Zhongming took the lead and jumped into the waist-deep water, closely followed by agricultural university students Zhen Yuju, Sun Yongshen, Wang Youman... Thin ice floated on the water, and the commune members and students held hands, forming a human wall. The gap was quickly blocked.

    For these young people, most of whom had not undergone rigorous training, this struggle was indeed a test. However, daring to struggle and daring to overcome difficulties are the characteristics of the youth of the Mao Zedong era. The students said proudly, "Heroes come from the ordinary, and victory comes from difficulties. Without difficulties, there is no such thing as battle." It was with this spirit that they worked with the commune members to carve out rice paddies like a chessboard from a saline-alkali land despite the freezing cold.

    "Observe the Sky, Observe the Land, Observe the Crops"
    The rice seedlings grew like a green carpet, and the students were happy from the bottom of their hearts. But soon, news suddenly came from the experimental field that the seedlings were turning yellow in circles. More than a dozen teachers and students rushed to the edge of the rice field and discussed it one after another:

    Students from the Plant Protection Department said, "It may be caused by diseases and pests."

    Students from the Soil Chemistry Department said, "Perhaps the organic fertilizer was not fully decomposed and damaged the seedlings."

    Some teachers and students from the Agronomy Department believed, "Perhaps it is an alkali damage phenomenon, but it is not exactly the same as what is taught in textbooks..."

    What was the cause? Could it be salvaged? Everyone's opinions were divided. At this moment, the Party Secretary of Huangcun Commune came here and said to the teachers and students: "Please invite a few old farmers to conduct a 'field consultation' and combine the farmers' experience with the knowledge in your books!"

    The next day, just as dawn was breaking, the students came to the field with notebooks. The Party Secretary, old farmers Zhang Wanqing, Zhao Dianjun, and others also came here. They carefully examined a few yellow seedlings, looked at the soil quality and water color, and thoroughly analyzed the weather and management conditions in recent days. Soon, they found out the problem. It turned out that after removing the oil paper from this seedling field, water was not irrigated in time to suppress the alkali, and it was exposed to wind and freezing, forming an anti-alkali damage seedling phenomenon. The students asked the old farmers: "Why did this alkali damage phenomenon not appear in the high places of the seedling tray, as it is said in the book, but in some low-lying places?" The old farmers took the teachers and students to another piece of land to analyze the soil conditions and said with a smile: The amount of salt and alkali in the soil here often varies in a piece of land. The teachers and students suddenly realized that this was the reason for the irregular yellowing of the seedlings. So, they came up with a solution together. The teachers also combined it with book knowledge and analyzed it theoretically, so that the students understood the knowledge in the books more deeply. After treatment, in a few days, the yellowing seedlings grew green again.

    From this incident, the teachers and students deeply realized that the farmers often say "observe the sky, observe the land, observe the crops," which is a summary of the farmers' valuable experience. From then on, whenever they encountered difficult problems in production, they invited old farmers to conduct such "field consultations."

    An Unusual Exam
    The rice harvest was over, and the teachers and students were about to return to school.

    In an ordinary farmhouse, the students were being given an oral exam on rice knowledge by teachers and old farmers. This was an unusual exam. Wu Yue walked in and sat down opposite the old farmer Zhang Wanqing. A year ago, she had just been admitted to Beijing Agricultural University, and she had never even seen what rice looked like. What would the results of today's exam be?

    The first question was: "How do you cultivate strong seedlings in saline-alkali land?"

    She spoke about the several different methods and different sowing periods of seedling cultivation in saline-alkali land in a logical and well-founded manner.

    The old farmer Zhang Wanqing nodded and then asked her, "What are the functions and relationship between harrowing the rice seedlings and applying fertilizer?"

    After thinking for a moment, she began to answer: "Harrowing the seedlings can loosen the soil, increase the temperature, promote the growth of new roots, and facilitate the absorption of more nutrients, so that the rice ears are large and the grains are full... Fertilization and harrowing must be well coordinated..." She spoke while gesturing with her hands, and she became more and more energetic as she spoke...

    The old farmer Zhang Wanqing praised: "The answer is good."

    This exam was just one manifestation of the students' good results. The first-year students said: "We have not only learned rice knowledge deeply and thoroughly, but also learned the cultivation techniques of major crops such as wheat, corn, and cotton, as well as some relevant basic knowledge, and we have learned it in a lively way." As for the third and fourth-year students, by studying and summarizing farmers' production experience, carrying out scientific research, and undertaking some teaching work for the first-year students, they have also greatly improved their theoretical knowledge level and trained their ability to teach, conduct scientific research, and organize production.

    The village entrance became lively as the teachers and students were about to return to school. The commune members gave bunches of rice to these new types of "farmers" and said enthusiastically: "We hope you will come again!" At this time, the teachers and students also said in unison: "The countryside is our good classroom, and we will come back."

    “农村是我们的好课堂”
    本报记者　傅军
    收获季节来到了，无边的田野，全是黄橙橙的稻海。北京农业大学的学生，和稻田的主人——京郊大兴县黄村公社的社员们，看到当地历史上第一次这般丰收的景象，一边紧张地抢收抢打，一边情不自禁地引吭高歌：
    丰收场上乐洋洋，
    盐碱沙洼变粮仓。
    毛主席共产党，
    是咱们亲爹娘。
    这个地区是个出名的十年九涝的“蛤蟆洼”，土质贫瘠。今年春天以来，社员们发愤图强，经过一场向大自然“挖穷根、栽富根”的斗争，终于把大面积盐碱地改造成稻田，现在已经丰收了。
    第一个考验
    3月初的一天，北京农业大学二百多名一、三、四年级学生，在教师带领下，踏上这片广阔的“处女地”，分别来到这个地区的黄村、采育、安定三个人民公社，和社员们一起参加了这场改造自然的战斗。初春的日子，北风呼啸，寒气逼人，大地冻得僵硬。学生们喊着“向地球开战，向自然索粮”的夯歌，和社员们一起挖渠、打埂开稻田。
    休息的时候，老社员李金城问学生们说：“这么冷的天气，挖渠、打埂，你们不怕艰苦吗？”
    学生们齐声响亮地回答道：“不怕！”
    李金城笑着说：“这就好，爬树还要费力气，我们这是革大自然的命，哪有不艰苦的。幸福的路要靠咱们自己走出来。”
    学生们听到这些话，看到社员们藐视困难、征服自然的英雄气概，浑身增添了百倍干劲，和社员们一样干得很出色。
    开拓稻田的战斗在紧张地进行。有一天，战斗任务是堵大龙河的一个两丈多宽的缺口。河埂上聚拢了两百多名社员和学生，一筐一筐往缺口里填土。可是，翻滚的急流很快就把倒下去的土冲走了。在这紧急关头，社员孙仲明带头跳入齐腰的大水中，紧跟在他后边跳入水中的是农大学生甄玉巨、孙永燊、王有满……。水上漂着薄薄的浮冰，社员、学生手拉着手，形成一道人墙。缺口很快就被堵住了。
    对这些大多数未受过艰苦锻炼的青年，这场斗争的确是一个考验。但是，敢于斗争，敢于战胜困难，是毛泽东时代青年的特色。学生们自豪地说：“英雄来自平凡，胜利来自困难，没有困难就无所谓战斗。”他们就是以这种精神，和社员们一起，战胜天寒地冻，从一片盐碱地上开出像棋盘一样的稻田来。
    “看天、看地、看庄稼”
    秧苗长得像一片绿油油的地毯，学生们从心眼里欢喜。可是不久，从试验田里，忽然传来一个消息，秧苗一圈一圈的变黄了。十几个教师和学生涌到秧田边，你一言我一语地议论起来：
    植物保护系学生说：“可能是病害引起的。”
    土壤化学系学生说：“可能是有机肥料没腐熟，伤害了秧苗。”
    有的教师和农学系学生认为：“也许是碱害现象，但是它同教科书上讲的又不完全一样……”
    到底是什么原因引起的？能不能挽救？大家意见不一致。正在这时，黄村公社党委书记来到这里，他对师生们说：“请几位老农来‘田间会诊’，把农民的经验和你们书本上的知识结合结合吧！”
    第二天，刚蒙蒙亮，学生们就带着笔记本来到田边。党委书记、老农张万清、赵殿俊等人也来到这里。他们拔了几根黄苗仔细察看，又看看土质、水色，详尽地分析了几天来的天气和管理情况，很快就把问题查究出来了。原来，这块秧田揭去油纸后，没有及时灌水压碱，又遇上刮风受冻，形成了反碱害苗现象。学生们问老农：“为什么这次碱害现象，不像书上所说，出现在秧盘高处，有的反而出在低洼处？”老农们带师生到另一块地上分析土情，笑着对他们说：这里的土壤盐碱分布量，在一块地里也常常各有不同。师生们恍然大悟，秧苗出现不规律变黄的现象，原来是这个道理。于是，他们一起提出了挽救的办法。教师也结合书本知识，从理论上进行了分析，使学生们对书本上的知识理解得更深了。经过处理，不几天，发黄的秧苗又长得一片碧绿了。
    从这件事，师生们深深体会到农民常说的“看天、看地、看庄稼”，正是农民宝贵经验的总结。从此，他们每遇到生产上的疑难问题，就请老农来进行这样的“田间会诊”。
    不寻常的考试
    水稻收割完毕，师生即将返回学校。
    在一间普通的农家房舍里，学生们正在接受教师和老农进行的水稻知识口试。这是一次不寻常的考试。吴岳走进来，在老农张万清对面坐下。一年前，她才考进北京农业大学，那时连水稻是什么样子还没有见过，今天考试结果会怎样呢？
    第一个问题是：“盐碱地如何培育壮秧？”
    她把在盐碱地采取几种不同方法和不同播种时期的育秧法，说得有条有理，有根有据。
    老农张万清点点头，接着又问她：“挠秧和施肥的作用和关系呢？”
    她沉思了一下后开始回答：“挠秧可使土松，提高温度，促进长新根，便于吸收更多的养分，使稻子穗大粒饱……施肥和挠秧要配合好……”她一面说，一面用手比划着，越说越起劲。……
    老农张万清称赞说：“答得不错。”
    这次考试，只是学生们取得良好成绩的一种表现。一年级学生说：“我们不仅对水稻知识学得深、透，还学习了小麦、玉米、棉花等主要作物的栽培技术和有关的一些基础知识，而且学得活了。”至于三、四年级学生，通过学习和总结农民生产经验、开展科学研究，和担任一年级部分教学工作，也大大提高了理论知识水平，锻炼了教学、科学研究和组织生产的能力。
    村头热闹起来，师生就要回校了。社员们把一束束的水稻送给这些新型的“庄稼人”，热情地说：“希望你们再来！”这时，师生们也异口同声地说：“农村是我们的好课堂，我们还要回来的。”
