    Tianjin's Agricultural Machinery Factories Support Rural Areas with Timely Winter Repair of Machinery
    Concentrating Main Efforts on Producing Agricultural Machinery Parts

    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 27th) The workers of Tianjin's agricultural machinery industry departments are concentrating their main efforts on producing agricultural machinery parts for the vast rural areas, ensuring the timely winter repair of tractors, gas engines, and other machinery to prepare for spring plowing.

    The Tianjin Municipal Agricultural Machinery Industry Bureau, based on the principle of "equal emphasis on main machines and parts," decided to prioritize parts production. In the fourth quarter, the focus is on tractor parts, producing over 400 different specifications of parts for various regions. Among these, wearing parts for tractors, such as oil pumps, oil nozzles, piston rings, track pins, and bushings, account for approximately 50%. The Tianjin Municipal Agricultural Machinery Industry Bureau established a leading group for parts production, headed by the director of the bureau, and also set up a specialized agency to manage parts production, strengthen dispatching, and check the production progress of each factory on a daily and ten-day basis, promptly resolving problems in production.

    To smoothly complete this task, seven factories specializing in the production of main machines, such as the Tianjin Power Machine Factory and the Internal Combustion Engine Factory, are also participating in the manufacture of more precise parts and have taken on the collaborative task of processing precision components for various parts factories.

    The workers of each agricultural machinery factory are actively innovating technology and enthusiastically launching competitions to ensure the timely, high-quality, and high-quantity completion of parts production plans. Workers at the Tianjin No. 1 Internal Combustion Engine Parts Factory have reformed their technological operations and appropriately reduced the number of processes, saving 160,000 work-hours in a month, which can increase the production of tens of thousands of bushings. In the past, the Tianjin No. 1 Bearing Factory could only produce bearings for rubber-wheeled carts. Recently, the workers themselves manufactured an internal cylindrical grinder and added a fine grinding process during grinding, ensuring that the quality of the bearings meets the national standards for universal parts. Currently, the bearings produced by this factory can be used in various agricultural machines.

    天津市各农机厂支援农村及时冬修机具
    集中主要力量生产农业机械配件
    本报天津27日电　天津市农业机械工业部门的职工，集中主要力量，为广大农村生产农业机械配件，保证拖拉机、煤气机等及时冬修，迎接春耕。
    天津市农业机械工业局根据“主机和配件并重”的原则，决定把配件生产放在首要地位，在第四季度内以拖拉机配件为主，为各地生产四百多种不同规格的配件。其中拖拉机用的油泵、油嘴、活塞环、链轨轴、轴瓦等易损部件约占50％左右。天津市农业机械工业局以局长为首成立了生产配件的领导小组，并且设立了专管配件生产的机构，加强调度工作，按日按旬检查各厂生产进度，及时解决生产中的问题。
    为了顺利完成这一任务，天津动力机厂、内燃机厂等七个专门生产主机的工厂，也参加制造比较精密的配件，并且担负了为各配件厂加工精密部件的协作任务。
    各农业机械厂职工都积极革新技术，热烈开展竞赛，保证按时按质按量地完成配件生产计划。天津市第一内燃机配件厂职工改革工艺操作，适当减少工序，一个月就能节约十六万个工时，可以增产十几万片轴瓦。天津市第一轴承厂过去只能生产胶轮大车上的轴承，最近职工们自己制造了一台内圆磨床，并且在研磨时增加了一道精磨工序，使轴承的质量达到国家规定的标准件通用化的要求。目前，这个厂生产的轴承可以用在各种不同的农业机械上。
