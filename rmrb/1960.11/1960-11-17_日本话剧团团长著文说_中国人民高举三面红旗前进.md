Head of Japanese Theater Troupe Writes
Chinese People Advance Holding High the Three Red Banners

    Murayama Tomoyoshi, head of the Japanese theater delegation who had just visited China, wrote in the "Akahata" on the 11th that this visit to China was a link in the common struggle of the people of Japan and China against the new "Security Treaty" concluded by American imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces. He said that all members of the Japanese theater troupe believed that this was the reason why the theater troupe received high praise everywhere and achieved great success during its performances in China.
    Murayama said that during their visit, they learned from the art of Chinese drama, film, dance, acrobatics, and music experiences that cannot be sorted out in a short period of time. They were particularly moved to see that Chinese drama was under the correct leadership of the state and that drama served the masses.
    He said that the Chinese people are holding high the three red banners and advancing with full confidence to build a socialist society. We have an obligation to introduce this situation in China to the Japanese people.

    日本话剧团团长著文说
    中国人民高举三面红旗前进
    刚刚访问过中国的日本话剧代表团团长村山知义在11日的“赤旗报”上发表的文章指出，这次访华演出是日中两国人民反对美帝国主义和日本反动势力所缔结的新“安全条约”的共同斗争的一个环节。他说，日本话剧团全体团员认为这是话剧团在中国演出时到处博得好评、获得巨大成功的原因。
    村山说，他们在访问期间，从中国的戏剧、电影、舞蹈、杂技和音乐等艺术中学到了并非一朝一夕所能整理出来的经验，尤其是看到中国话剧受到国家的正确领导，话剧为群众服务这一点，深受感动。
    他说，中国人民正高举着三面红旗，满怀信心地为建设社会主义社会而前进。我们有义务把中国的这种情况介绍给日本人民。
