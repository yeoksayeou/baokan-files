(Xinhua News Agency, 16th) Beijing Agricultural University has implemented a three-way combination of teachers, students, and farmers, achieving fruitful results in carrying out scientific research, improving teaching quality, and cultivating talent.

    Two years ago, the school began sending teachers and students to the countryside to participate in production labor and learn from farmers' production experience. Through continuous improvement, they have developed a set of practices for teaching and scientific research by learning and summarizing farmers' production experience. This year, based on summarizing two years of experience, they have more systematically sent teachers and students to more than 50 people's communes in the suburbs of Beijing and across the country to eat, live, and work with farmers, focusing on local production tasks, closely integrating with local cadres and farmers, vigorously grasping key production aspects, cultivating high-yield experimental fields, and conducting scientific research. They also adopted methods such as following shifts, holding field consultations, and inviting experienced farmers to lecture, to carry out teaching activities. They summarized this teaching process into six characters: "Do, Listen, Read, Discuss, Summarize, Write." At the same time, according to different grades and different requirements, they implemented a combination of long-term fixed-point decentralization and phased decentralization, a combination of on-campus and off-campus teaching and scientific research, a combination of studying local experience and studying national experience, and a combination of fixed contact and key investigation. Freshmen in the first year spend about half a year in labor training, while also receiving agricultural basic knowledge teaching. Students in the second, third, fourth, and fifth grades are decentralized in phases, and at each base point, they cooperate with students of higher and lower grades to study professional courses and conduct scientific research, with students in the fourth and fifth grades focusing on special summaries and improvement work. This closely links book knowledge with production practice and scientific research, so that the production experience learned is promptly summarized into theory, and students of higher and lower grades all receive different degrees of improvement, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results in teaching.

    This year, the six departments of the school—Agronomy, Horticulture, Soil and Agrochemistry, Physical Meteorology, Agricultural Economics, and Plant Protection—conducted more high-yield experimental projects with farmers than in any previous year. Most of the experiments have achieved "high-yield" results. Together with farmers in Daxing County, Beijing, they transformed saline-alkali depressions into paddy fields, achieving high yields of rice on large areas of saline-alkali depressions, with yields increasing three to four times compared to the past. Teachers and students of the Agronomy and Horticulture departments summarized farmers' experience and harvested high-yield white radishes and sweet potatoes as large as coconuts, weighing twenty to thirty pounds each, in high-yield fields. Teachers and students also conducted high-yield experiments on spring-sown crops and summer sowing, two crops a year, in the suburbs of Beijing. They studied and summarized the high-yield experiences of national cotton-growing experts Qu Yaoli, Guo Zhenxi, and Zhang Qiuxiang, wheat high-yield model worker Liu Yingxiang, and farmers in the suburbs of Beijing, and proposed and solved many problems in cultivation. In the past, cultivation science believed that "weak seedlings from late-sown wheat inevitably reduce yield." This year, teachers and students from the Agronomy and other departments and farmers transformed weak seedlings of late-sown wheat into strong seedlings, achieving an average yield of 805 jin per mu.

    "Producing Theory" is particularly evident in the departments of Agricultural Meteorology and Plant Protection. The Department of Agricultural Meteorology had a weak foundation in the past. This year, they began to establish their own teaching system by summarizing farmers' experience. Many theories not found in books in the past and materials that could not be found are now found in farmers' experience. Through learning from farmers, teachers and students majoring in agricultural meteorology have accumulated new data on the relationship between crops and meteorology, the distribution of water and heat resources, waterlogging, drought, wind, and freezing disasters, and mass drought resistance measures in our country, laying the foundation for revising and compiling new textbooks and exploring the ways to establish and develop China's agricultural meteorology science. Teachers and students in the Horticulture Department wrote more than 100 scientific reports while summarizing the experience of fruit tree and vegetable cultivation and seed selection with farmers, and are currently compiling four new textbooks, including fruit tree physiology and vegetable physiology.

    Due to the close combination of teaching and production practice, students' academic performance has rapidly improved, and many first- and second-year students have also become pioneers in the field of scientific research. Lower-grade students, by participating in production labor and various scientific experiments with farmers and higher-grade students, have not only learned the professional knowledge and skills of their undergraduate major, but also learned various sciences related to it. They learn deeply and broadly, and can also apply what they have learned in production practice. Thirty-two second-year students from the Veterinary Medicine Department spent more than a month learning on the job in pig farms, put forward twelve feasible suggestions, and wrote sixteen summary reports.

    Through decentralization and labor training, teachers and students have also gained a great deal in terms of ideology. More and more students have further established the idea of being red in the countryside and specializing in the countryside, and their class viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint have been greatly strengthened. The students who participated in rice reform in Daxing County regarded the countryside as their own home. They worked hard and were determined to turn saline-alkali depressions into fertile land.

    北京农业大学师生坚持参加生产劳动
    提高了教学质量　促进了农业生产
    据新华社16日讯　北京农业大学实行教师、学生、农民三结合，在开展科学研究、提高教学质量、培养人材等方面都取得了丰硕成果。
    这个学校在两年以前就开始下放师生到农村，参加生产劳动，学习农民生产经验。经过不断改进和提高，摸索出了一套通过学习和总结农民生产经验来进行教学、科学研究的做法。今年，在总结两年经验的基础上，他们更有计划地下放师生到北京郊区和全国各地五十多个人民公社，与农民同吃同住同劳动，以当地生产任务为中心，和当地干部、农民紧密结合，大抓生产关键，大种丰产试验田，大搞科学研究，并采取跟班学习、田头会诊、老农讲课等方式，开展教学活动。他们把这种教学过程概括成“做、听、读、议、总、写”六个字。同时按照不同年级不同要求，实行长期定点下放和分期下放相结合，校内校外教学、科学研究相结合，研究本地经验和研究全国经验相结合，固定联系与重点调查相结合。一年级新生约有半年左右时间下放劳动锻炼，同时进行农业基础知识教学。二、三、四、五年级学生分期下放，在各基点采取高低年级配合，学习专业课并进行科学研究，其中四、五年级学生着重进行专题总结、提高工作。这就把书本知识和生产实践、科学研究紧紧联在一起，使学得的生产经验及时总结成理论，高、低年级的学生都得到程度不同的提高，在教学上收到多、快、好、省的效果。
    这个学校的农学、园艺、土壤农化、物理气象、农业经济、植物保护六个系今年同农民一起进行的丰产试验项目超过以往任何一年。大部分试验都创造了“出高产”的成绩。他们同北京市大兴县农民一起把盐碱洼地改造成水稻田。并在大片盐碱洼地上获得水稻丰产，产量比过去提高三、四倍。农学、园艺等系师生总结农民经验，在丰产田中收获了高额丰产的白萝卜，以及一颗颗大如椰子重达二、三十斤的甘薯等。师生们还在北京郊区进行了春播作物夏播、一年两收的丰产试验。他们研究和总结了全国植棉能手曲耀离、郭振西、张秋香、小麦丰产劳模刘迎祥等人和北京郊区农民的丰产经验，提出并解决了栽培学上的许多问题。过去的栽培学上，认为晚播小麦“苗弱必然减产”，今年农学等系师生和农民却使晚播小麦弱苗变壮，取得了平均亩产八百零五斤的丰产成果。
      “出理论”，在农业气象、植物保护等系科表现特别明显。农业气象系过去基础较弱。今年他们在总结农民经验中，才开始建立起自己的教学体系。许多过去在书本上见不到的理论、找不到的资料，现在都在农民经验中找到了。农业气象专业师生通过向农民学习，积累起我国自己的作物与气象关系、水热资源分布、水旱风冻灾害、群众抗旱措施等新资料，打下了修改和编写新教材的基础，摸索到建立和发展中国农业气象科学的途径。园艺系师生在和农民一起总结果树、蔬菜栽培和选种经验中，写出一百多篇科学报告，目前正在编写果树生理、蔬菜生理等四种新教材。
    由于教学和生产实践紧密结合，学生的学习成绩迅速提高，许多一、二年级学生也成为科学研究领域中的闯将。低年级学生由于同农民、高年级学生参加了生产劳动和各种科学试验，不仅学到了本科的专业知识和技能，还学习到与它有关的多种科学，他们学得既深又广，还能在生产实际中应用。兽医系二年级三十二名学生在猪场跟班学习一个多月，提出了十二条切实可行的建议，写出了十六篇总结报告。
    师生们通过下放劳动锻炼，在思想方面收获也非常大。越来越多的学生进一步树立起红在农村、专在农村的思想，他们的阶级观点、生产观点、群众观点都大大加强了。在大兴县参加水稻改革的学生，把农村当成自己的家。他们发愤图强，立志要把盐碱洼地变为良田。（附图片）
