　　Xinhua News Agency, Bogotá, 26th. The Columbian newspaper "Voice of Democracy" published an article entitled "The People of Latin American Countries are Advancing," commenting on the recent strike movements in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, as well as the people's demonstrations in Bolivia and Venezuela. The article stated that the masses are responding to the reactionary tendencies of some national governments with an increasingly prominent shift to the left.

　　The article pointed out, "The recent strikes show that the working class will no longer endure hunger policies without a fight. Achieving a general wage increase is only one step towards fundamentally changing this long-standing policy of economic bankruptcy. Ultimately, there must be an end to the economic dependence on the United States that is still being promoted in Latin American countries. In this context, Cuba's example is of great significance to workers." The article emphasized the significance of the recent attack on the U.S. embassy in Bolivia, pointing out that the U.S. embassy is a "symbol of the oppression of the people of all countries." The article also believes that the recent political events in Venezuela also belong to the same kind of upheaval. The article said that Betancourt's policies "are increasingly tending to serve the interests of backward and anti-national forces; he is also mocking the hopes of the Venezuelan people and violating the campaign promises that brought him to power."

    哥伦比亚《民主呼声报》评拉丁美洲当前形势
    拉丁美洲各国人民在前进
    古巴的榜样鼓舞了各国劳动者的斗争
    新华社波哥大26日电　哥伦比亚《民主呼声报》以《拉丁美洲各国人民在前进》为题发表一篇文章，评述最近在阿根廷、巴西和智利发生的罢工运动，以及玻利维亚和委内瑞拉发生的人民示威事件。文章说，人民群众以愈来愈突出的向左倾的转变来回击一些国家政府的反动倾向。
    文章指出，“最近发生的罢工表明了，工人阶级不再不斗争地忍受饥饿政策。获得普遍提高工资仅仅是通向基本改变这个漫长的经济破产政策的一个步骤。最后必将出现必须摆脱还在拉丁美洲国家推行的依赖美国的经济束缚。在这种情况下，古巴的榜样对劳动者来说有着巨大的意义。”文章强调指出了最近在玻利维亚发生的袭击美国大使馆的事件的意义，并且指出美国大使馆是“压迫各国人民的象征”。文章还认为委内瑞拉最近发生的政治事件也属于同一种激变。文章说，贝坦科尔特的政策“愈来愈倾向于为落后和反民族力量的利益服务；他并且嘲笑委内瑞拉人民的希望，和违反使他上台的竞选诺言”。
