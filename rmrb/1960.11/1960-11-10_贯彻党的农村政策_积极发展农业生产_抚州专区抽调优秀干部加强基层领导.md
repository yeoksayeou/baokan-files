Implement the Party's Rural Policies and Actively Develop Agricultural Production
Fuzhou Special District Transfers Outstanding Cadres to Strengthen Grassroots Leadership

Nanchang, November 9th (reporting). The Party committees at all levels in the Fuzhou Special District of Jiangxi Province have adopted various measures to strengthen grassroots leadership in key grain-producing areas and areas with weak work foundations. This has enabled these two types of areas to better implement the Party's various policies in rural areas and has powerfully promoted the mass movement of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production throughout the special district.

Currently, the key grain-producing areas are taking the lead, having completed the autumn harvest ahead of schedule, and the winter plowing and sowing are progressing very rapidly. The vast majority of backward communes and brigades in the special district, where the work base was relatively weak in the past, have caught up with the advanced communes and brigades in the autumn harvest and winter planting. The autumn harvest and winter planting throughout the district are faster and better than in any previous year.

After the mass movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production was launched in depth, the Fuzhou Prefectural Party Committee studied the issue of how to strengthen leadership over the movement. The Prefectural Party Committee analyzed the situation in the entire district. First, grain production is relatively concentrated. From the perspective of the entire district, the concentration point of grain production is in Linchuan County; each county and commune also has key communes and brigades for grain production. Second, some areas where work was poor in the past have not quickly caught up in the movement, and the main reason for this is the weak grassroots leadership. Based on these circumstances, the Fuzhou Prefectural Party Committee decided to vigorously strengthen grassroots leadership in these two types of areas.

According to the decision of the Prefectural Party Committee, Party committees at all levels first transferred more than 5,000 outstanding cadres to production teams in key grain-producing areas and communes in areas with weak work foundations to take up practical positions. At the same time, a group of secretaries and members of the Prefectural Party Committee and county Party committees also went to these two types of areas to concurrently serve as the first secretary of the county Party committee or commune Party committee, or other positions.

The major responsible cadres of the prefectural and county Party committees went down level by level to concurrently serve as the main leaders of the Party organizations, and the transfer of a large number of outstanding cadres had an immediate effect on strengthening grassroots work. Jinxi County had relatively weak work in the past, with 30 backward brigades out of the county's 138 production brigades. After Yan Dong, Secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee, went to this county to concurrently serve as the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, he visited all the backward brigades, and then went deep into the Fengshou Brigade of Chengquan Commune to organize mass discussions, visit people at their homes, and conduct on-the-spot inspections to investigate in detail the reasons for their backwardness. He discovered that the fundamental reason for the backwardness of these teams was the weak leadership of the production teams. Therefore, he took the Fengshou Brigade as a point of focus and further convened small team Party branch meetings and mass meetings in this team to discuss how to enhance the leadership of the production teams. As a result, the following three measures were proposed and implemented: First, elect outstanding commune members who are Party members, Communist Youth League members, and of poor and lower-middle peasant background to serve as small team leaders and work group leaders; second, each small team, with the team leader as the core, will be composed of work group leaders and representatives of commune members of poor peasant background to form a small team committee to specifically direct the production of the entire team and arrange the life of the entire team; third, regularly convene commune member representative meetings to listen to the opinions of commune members. After these measures were implemented, the Fengshou Brigade established a leadership with poor peasants as the advantage, and the enthusiasm of the commune members for production was fully mobilized, and work and production both leaped forward. Comrade Yan Dong then summarized the experience of the Fengshou Brigade and promoted it to all backward brigades in the county. With the strengthening of grassroots leadership, 20 of the county's 30 backward brigades have now become advanced teams, and the remaining 10 teams have also caught up with the general teams.

While strengthening grassroots leadership, the county Party committees of each county also went to the countryside to hold mobile Party schools, using local materials and enrolling students on the spot. They worked and produced during the day, and studied in the morning and evening, so that a large number of commune and brigade cadres received training without leaving their posts. The commune Party committees also set up amateur red and expert schools that both study politics and learn culture and production technology, absorbing a large number of small team cadres into the schools to participate in learning. Currently, 23,000 general brigade cadres and small team cadres in the entire special district have participated in half a month to two months of study in red and expert schools; more than 4,600 brigade Party branch secretaries and team leaders, as well as general commune cadres, have participated in one month of study in the county Party committee's mobile Party schools in the countryside. Through such studies, the ideological, work, and policy levels of these cadres have been improved, and they are playing an increasingly important role in the movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production.

### 贯彻党的农村政策　积极发展农业生产  抚州专区抽调优秀干部加强基层领导

    贯彻党的农村政策　积极发展农业生产
    抚州专区抽调优秀干部加强基层领导
    本报南昌9日电　江西抚州专区各级党委采取各种办法加强重点产粮地区和工作薄弱地区的基层领导，使这两种地区更好地贯彻了党在农村的各项方针政策，有力地促进了全专区大办农业大办粮食的群众运动。
    现在，各重点产粮区一马当先，秋收已提前完成，冬耕冬播进度十分迅速。全专区少数工作基础比较薄弱的后进社和大队，在秋收冬种中绝大部分赶上了先进社、队。全区秋收冬种比过去任何一年都快都好。
    大办农业大办粮食的群众运动深入展开后，中共抚州地委就如何加强对运动领导的问题做了研究。地委分析了全区的情况。第一、粮食生产比较集中。从全区来看，粮食生产集中点在临川县；各县各公社也都有粮食生产的重点社、队。第二、运动中有些过去工作较差的地区没有迅速跟上来，其主要原因是基层领导力量较弱。根据这些情况，抚州地委决定大力加强这两类地区的基层领导。
    各级党委根据地委的决定，首先下放了五千多名优秀干部到重点产粮区和工作薄弱地区各公社的生产队担任实职。同时，地委和各县委的一批书记和委员也下到了这两种地区兼任县委、公社党委第一书记或其他职务。
    地、县党委的主要负责干部逐级下去兼任党组织的主要职务和大批优秀干部下放后，对基层工作的加强立竿见影。金溪县过去工作比较薄弱，全县一百三十八个生产大队中有三十个后进大队。地委书记严冬到这个县兼任县委第一书记后，他走访了全部后进大队，接着又深入到其中的城关公社丰收大队，组织群众座谈、登门访问、实地察看，详细调查后进的原因。发现这些队后进的根本原因是生产小队领导力量较弱。于是，他又以丰收大队为点，再深入这个队召开小队党支部会、群众会，讨论如何增强生产小队的领导力量。结果，提出并贯彻执行了这样三条措施：一、选举党、团员和贫农、下中农成分的优秀社员担任小队队长和作业组长；二、各小队以队长为核心，由作业组长、贫农成分的社员代表参加组成小队委员会，具体指挥全队生产、安排全队生活；三、定期召开社员代表会，听取社员的意见。这些措施施行以后，丰收大队各小队树立了以贫农为优势的领导，社员们的生产积极性被充分调动了起来，工作、生产双双跃进。严冬同志接着总结了丰收大队的这一经验，向全县各后进大队进行推广。随着基层领导的加强，现在，全县三十个后进大队中已有二十个队变成了先进队，其余十个队也已赶上了一般队。
    在加强基层领导力量的同时，各县县委都下乡巡回举办党校，就地取材、就地收学生，白天工作、生产，早晨、晚上学习，使大批公社、大队干部在不离开工作岗位的情况下受到了训练。各公社党委也都办起了业余的既学政治又学文化和生产技术的红专学校，吸收大批小队干部进校参加学习。现在，全专区已有二万三千名大队一般干部和小队干部进红专学校参加了半个月到二个月的学习；有四千六百多名大队党支部书记和队长及公社一般干部进县委下乡巡回党校学习了一个月。通过这样的学习，已使这些干部的思想、工作和政策水平有了提高，在大办农业大办粮食的运动中，发挥着越来越大的作用。
