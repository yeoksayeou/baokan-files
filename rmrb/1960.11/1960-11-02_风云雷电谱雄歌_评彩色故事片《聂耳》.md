    An Epic Song of Wind, Clouds, Thunder, and Lightning
    -- A Review of the Color Feature Film "Nie Er"
    Chen Mo
    I.
    Nie Er only lived to twenty-four years old before the sea took his life. Nie Er's life was truly too short! However, this great singer of the people, the founder of proletarian music in our country, and a good son of the Chinese Communist Party, his contributions to the people's revolutionary cause and revolutionary musical art will be evergreen and immortal.
    In order to commemorate Nie Er, learn from Nie Er, inherit and carry forward Nie Er's revolutionary spirit of dedicating himself to the people's cause, and establish Nie Er's glorious image on the screen, it is a very meaningful work. Thanks to our film artists for successfully completing the production of this excellent film "Nie Er" on the eve of the 25th anniversary of Nie Er's death.
    Yes, the glorious path of the founder of proletarian music in our country should be expressed like this in the film: Precisely because he closely linked his personal destiny with the destiny of the nation, the destiny of the people, and the destiny of the proletariat, his life gained such lofty significance; Precisely because his creative activities were rooted in the people's struggle life and expressed the revolutionary feelings of the people, his works will always become our national treasures; Precisely because his art is the bugle of national liberation and the weapon of revolutionary struggle, they will always radiate immortal brilliance. Nie Er, who lived and fought twenty-five years ago, his image makes us feel so cordial because his life path and artistic path have these extremely valuable characteristics.
    Yes, the image of a proletarian literary and artistic fighter should be shaped like this in the film: the historical picture of the Chinese national democratic revolution in the 1930s and the growth of Nie Er's personal character organically constitute the typical character in the typical environment; the torrent of the times and the inner world of the revolutionary musician are intertwined into an inspiring movement; the common characteristics of a generation of revolutionary literary and artistic workers and the unique and distinct personality of the protagonist are unified into a rich and complete artistic image. Revolutionary ideology and artistry have reached a rather perfect combination in this film.
    It can be affirmed: "Nie Er" is one of the valuable gains of our film art. The emergence of "Nie Er" and a batch of excellent films in recent years marks the gradual maturity of our country's proletarian film art. The success of "Nie Er" is the victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, and the victory of the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism.
    II.
    Through Nie Er's personal destiny, the film reflects and summarizes the destiny of a generation of revolutionary literary and artistic workers, and reflects and summarizes the destiny of the Chinese nation in the 1930s. This is the most prominent achievement of the film "Nie Er."
    Many literary and artistic works attempt to reflect the destiny of the times through the protagonist's personal destiny. However, not all works can achieve this goal well. The experience of revolutionary literature and art leads us to a conclusion: only through the destiny of figures standing at the forefront of the times can we fully reflect our soaring spirit of the times. The success of the film "Nie Er" is primarily because it chose a revolutionary like Nie Er, who can best embody the mainstream of our times, as the protagonist, and at the same time convincingly shows the path that thousands of revolutionary intellectuals once took through the protagonist's path.
    The film vividly and profoundly summarizes the path of a generation of revolutionary literary and artistic workers in our country through the process of Nie Er's growth from a petty-bourgeois intellectual dissatisfied with the dark reality to a heroic proletarian literary and artistic fighter under the education of the Chinese Communist Party. We can see from the film: on the one hand, Nie Er's personality is distinct and unique. He is optimistic, humorous, enthusiastic, and full of fighting spirit. Under the severe White Terror, he and his comrades finished writing revolutionary slogans on the street and greeted the reactionary police as if nothing had happened; in order to combat the decadent art of the bourgeoisie, he wrote articles criticizing the song and dance troupes that spread靡靡之音 (decadent music) everywhere, regardless of others' curses; in order to protest the crime of reactionary military police banning anti-Japanese dramas, he risked his life and played the Internationale in front of the enemy's bayonets… In short, Nie Er is Nie Er, and we will never confuse him with other heroic images. On the other hand, we can also see that the protagonist of the film is not a simple reproduction of the historical Nie Er. This artistic image concentrates and summarizes the common characteristics of many revolutionary artists of Nie Er's time: the fervent pursuit of revolutionary ideals, the selfless dedication to the cause of national liberation, the gnashing hatred for Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the contempt and aversion for bourgeois literature and art. They forged their love for the people and hatred for the enemy into sharp artistic weapons, striking at the ferocity of the enemy and inspiring the people's fighting spirit.
    The film's reflection and summary of the destiny of the times is closely combined with the shaping of Nie Er's character and Nie Er's political and artistic development path. Nie Er's immortality lies in the fact that he was the first genius singer in the history of Chinese music to use his art to compose the voice of the working masses and express the revolutionary will of the Chinese nation. The film uses very carefully selected details to show the era that produced Nie Er and his music. Those fleeting shots on the screen, as well as the scenes that are emphasized, all head towards a common goal: to display the glorious picture of the Chinese people carrying out an unyielding revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party in the face of the double suffering of national crisis and class oppression. Whether it is the tragic life of dock workers or the wandering of the song and dance troupe; whether it is the flames of the "January 28th" Songhu War in which the 19th Route Army resisted Japan, or the heroic posture of the Red Army warriors who seized the Luding Bridge; whether it is the flying rally on Nanjing Road or the torrent of demonstrations in front of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters… All these shots and scenes in the film, which are rich in the characteristics of the times, show the era in which Nie Er lived and promote the development of Nie Er's character, and finally, they in turn become the source of Nie Er's creation. The film convincingly proves a truth: the reason why Nie Er was able to become a revolutionary fighter and a singer of the people is because he gave his entire life to the revolution and to the people, rejoicing in what the people rejoice in and worrying about what the people worry about. The people nourished Nie Er with their milk, and Nie Er composed the roar of the people with his music. In this film, the destiny of the times and the destiny of the protagonist have reached a high degree of unity, and the broad historical background and the detailed character portrayal have reached a perfect fusion. And penetrating the audience's heart through the screen is Nie Er's singing that resounds through the clouds, the strongest sound of our times!
    III.
    The revelation of the protagonist's rich inner life is another prominent achievement of the film "Nie Er." This characteristic has played a major role in the success of the film in shaping the image of Nie Er.
    Revealing the inner world of characters is originally an important means for all literary and artistic works to shape characters. The authors of the film "Nie Er" excellently used this means, so the image of the protagonist appears very full. We see that the film adopts various methods to display Nie Er's inner world. When Nie Er sees the leaflet given to him by Su Ping commemorating the third anniversary of "August 1st," the film uses the memories of the Kunming student movement to express Nie Er's yearning for revolutionary struggle; on the night of his twentieth birthday, the film uses Nie Er's diary to express his distress and self-encouragement in seeking a way out; when he sees Zheng Leidian's red back disappearing on the Longhua Pagoda, we hear Nie Er's affectionate blessing: "Go! You swallow that heralds spring!" On the ocean-going ship in the Huangpu River, we hear Nie Er's monologue of infinite attachment to the motherland and the people: "Goodbye, comrades and friends!" From these details, we can glimpse the protagonist's deep love for comrades, for the motherland, and for the revolutionary cause in the depths of his soul. Nie Er's inner world and his words and deeds are so lovely and so beautiful. This display of the inner world is not only necessary for enriching the image of the character, but also plays a great role in enhancing the poetic flavor of the entire film.
    Nie Er is first and foremost a revolutionary, and then a musician. And Nie Er's most important weapon for carrying out revolutionary activities is his musical creation. Therefore, shaping the image of Nie Er, in addition to showing his other aspects of life and struggle experience, and showing the inner motives of his various actions, it is necessary to focus on showing his musical creation activities, especially the inner activities during the creation process.
    The film does not show the creation process of some of Nie Er's famous songs in isolation. Instead, it organically combines the brewing and maturity of these songs with Nie Er's entire revolutionary activities, as well as Nie Er's inner feelings in revolutionary activities, which is very correct. Originally, Nie Er's creation was by no means a mysterious burst of "inspiration," but a product of the reflection of the people's life in the mind of this revolutionary musician. We can say that Nie Er's short life is a magnificent symphony. This symphony was already sounding before the film began, but we can see that only after the revolutionary notes appeared in the movement of his life, did this symphony begin to emit dazzling brilliance. Only after finding the Party and participating in revolutionary activities did the revolutionary wind, clouds, thunder, and lightning begin to become the melody of his life. Thus, in the flames of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, while bravely rescuing the wounded, Nie Er's heart sprouted the initial musical thoughts of "Advancing through the enemy's artillery fire!" And the personal experience of the wandering life of the "Five Flower Song and Dance Troupe" made him express his indignation at the times and his concern for the country in "The Singing Girl Under Iron Hoofs." In "Yangtze River Storm," he began to compose the emotions of the working people. This is a sign that Nie Er's fate is becoming more and more inseparable from the working class. In the "Internationale" incident, Nie Er's fist struck out blood marks on the wall, he played the "Internationale" in the enemy's bayonet forest, and his emotions were as unstoppable as a flood. Nie Er's application to join the Party and his feelings on the Great Wall further formed the future embryo of the "March of the Volunteers," and when Su Ping informed him that his application to join the Party had been approved, Nie Er used his playing on the piano to vent his joy, although there was not a single statement, we can fully resonate with his inner world. It was precisely in the heat of the struggle that had been brewing for three whole years that our Nie Er finally composed our most beloved, inspiring, and now the national anthem of our great motherland, "March of the Volunteers," in one night. The scenes shown on the screen when Nie Er composed this song: the artillery fire in Zhabei, the demonstration teams, the martyrdom of the martyrs, and the Red Flag of the Long March, all turned into激越(impassioned) notes. Is this realism? Yes, this is revolutionary realism, this is the most authentic summary of the bloody and fiery struggle reality of the Chinese nation! Is this romanticism? Yes, this is revolutionary romanticism, burning in Nie Er's inner world is the raging fire of revolutionary ideals, is the prediction that the Chinese people will surely be liberated, the revolutionary wind, clouds, thunder and lightning are composed into an epic song of the Chinese people's revolution in the hands of the musician. The revolutionary storm of hundreds of millions of people is surging in the inner world of this people's musician, how can people tell which part is objective reality and which part is subjective inspiration!
    The achievements of "Nie Er" are multifaceted. In this post-viewing reflection, only the literary part of the film is involved, and I hope that other comrades will comment on the film's outstanding achievements from other aspects.

    风云雷电谱雄歌
    ——评彩色故事片《聂耳》
    陈默
    一
    聂耳只活到二十四岁，大海就夺去了他的生命。聂耳的一生实在太短促了！但是，这位伟大的人民歌手、我国无产阶级音乐的奠基人、中国共产党的好儿子，他对人民革命事业和革命音乐艺术所作出的贡献，却将万古长青，永垂不朽。
    为了纪念聂耳，学习聂耳，继承和发扬聂耳献身人民事业的革命精神，把聂耳的光辉形象在银幕上树立起来，是一件很有意义的工作。感谢我们的电影艺术家们，在聂耳逝世二十五周年的前夕，出色地完成了《聂耳》这部优秀影片的制作。
    是的，应当像影片这样表现我国无产阶级音乐奠基人的光辉道路：正因为他把个人的命运同民族的命运、人民的命运、无产阶级的命运紧紧地结合在一起，他的生命才获得了如此崇高的意义；正因为他的创作活动根植于人民的斗争生活，抒发了人民的革命情感，他的作品才永远成为我们民族的瓌宝；正因为他的艺术是民族解放的号角和革命斗争的武器，它们才永远焕发出不朽的光芒。生活和战斗在二十五年前的聂耳，他的形象之所以使我们感到无比的亲切，就是因为他的生活道路和艺术道路具有这些极为宝贵的特点。
    是的，应当像影片这样塑造无产阶级文艺战士的形象：三十年代中国民族民主革命的历史画图与聂耳个人性格的成长有机地构成了典型环境中的典型性格；时代的洪流和革命音乐家的内心世界交织成激奋人心的乐章；一代革命文艺家的共同特征和主人公独特鲜明的个性统一成丰富完整的艺术形象。革命的思想性与艺术性在这部影片里达到了相当完美的结合。
    可以肯定：《聂耳》是我们电影艺术可贵的收获之一。《聂耳》和近年来一批优秀影片的出现，标志着我国无产阶级电影艺术的逐渐成熟。《聂耳》的成就是毛泽东文艺思想的胜利，是革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法的胜利。
    二
    通过聂耳的个人命运，反映和概括了一代革命文艺工作者的命运，反映和概括了三十年代中华民族的命运。这是影片《聂耳》最突出的成就。
    不少文艺作品都企图通过主人公的个人命运来反映时代的命运。但是，并不是所有的作品都能够很好地达到这个目的的。革命文艺的经验使我们得出一个结论：只有通过站在时代最前列的人物的命运，才有可能充分地反映出我们的高昂的时代精神。影片《聂耳》的成功，首先就是因为它选择了像聂耳这样一位最能体现我们时代的主流的革命者作为主人公，同时又令人信服地通过主人公的道路，表现了千千万万革命知识分子曾经走过的道路。
    影片通过聂耳从一个不满黑暗现实的小资产阶级知识青年，在中国共产党的教育下，成长为英勇的无产阶级文艺战士的过程，极为生动而深刻地概括了我国一代革命文艺家的道路。我们从影片里可以看到：一方面，聂耳的个性是鲜明的，独特的。他乐观、幽默、热情奔放、斗志昂扬。在严重的白色恐怖下，他和伙伴们在街头写完革命标语，还若无其事地跟反动警察打招呼；为了打击资产阶级的腐朽艺术，他不顾别人的咒骂，写文章抨击到处散播靡靡之音的歌舞团；为了抗议反动军警禁演抗日戏剧的罪行，他冒着生命的危险，在敌人的刺刀面前高奏起《国际歌》……总之，聂耳就是聂耳，我们永远不会把他跟别的英雄形象相混淆。另一方面，我们也可以看到，影片的主人公并不是历史上的聂耳的简单再现，在这个艺术形象上，集中和概括了聂耳同时代许多革命艺术家所共有的特征：对革命理想的热烈追求，对民族解放事业的奋不顾身，对日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的切齿痛恨，对资产阶级文艺的鄙视厌恶。他们把自己对人民的热爱和对敌人的仇恨，熔铸成犀利的艺术武器，打击敌人的凶焰，鼓舞人民的斗志。
    影片对时代命运的反映和概括，是同对聂耳性格的塑造，对聂耳政治上和艺术上的发展道路紧密地结合在一起的。聂耳的不朽，就在于他是中国音乐史上最先用自己的艺术谱出了工农大众的心声，表达了中华民族的革命意志的天才歌手。影片以十分精选的细节，表现了产生聂耳和他的音乐的时代。银幕上那些一闪而过的镜头，以及着重描写的场面，都奔向一个共同的目标：展示当年在民族危机和阶级压迫的双重苦难面前，中国人民在共产党领导下进行不屈不挠的革命斗争的光辉图景。不论是码头工人的悲惨生活，还是歌舞团的四处飘流；不论是“一·二八”淞沪战争中十九路军抗日的烽火，还是红军勇士飞夺泸定桥的英姿；不论是南京路上的飞行集会，还是国民党市党部前示威游行的洪流……影片中所有这一切富有时代特征的镜头和场面，既显示了聂耳所处的时代，又推动了聂耳性格的发展，而最后，它们又反过来成为聂耳创作的泉源。影片令人信服地证明了一个真理：聂耳之所以能够成为革命的战士，人民的歌手，就是因为他把自己整个的生命，交给了革命，交给了人民，以人民之喜为喜，以人民之忧为忧。人民以自己的奶汁哺育了聂耳，聂耳以自己的音乐谱出了人民的怒吼。在这部影片里，时代的命运和主人公的命运达到了高度的统一，广阔的历史背景和细致的性格刻划达到了水乳交融。而透过银幕一直钻进观众心灵深处的，则是响彻云霄的聂耳的歌声，我们时代的最强音！
    三
    对主人公丰富的内心生活的揭示，是影片《聂耳》另一个突出的成就。这个特色对影片塑造聂耳形象的成功，是起了重大作用的。
    揭示人物的内心世界，本来是一切文艺作品塑造人物重要的手段，影片《聂耳》的作者出色地运用了这种手段，因此，主人公的形象显得非常丰满。我们看到，影片对聂耳内心世界的展示是采取了多种方式的。在聂耳看苏平给他的纪念“八一”三周年的传单时，影片用关于昆明学生运动的回忆，表现了聂耳对革命斗争的向往；在他二十岁生日的夜晚，影片通过聂耳的日记表现他寻求出路的苦闷和自励；在龙华塔上目送郑雷电远去的红色背影时，我们听到了聂耳深情的祝福：“去吧！你这报春的燕子！”在黄浦江中的远洋轮船上，我们听到了聂耳对祖国和人民无限依恋的独白：“再会吧，同志们，朋友们！”从这一些细节里，我们可以窥见主人公灵魂深处对同志，对祖国，对革命事业的无比热爱。聂耳的内心世界和他的言行都是那么可爱，那么美丽，这种内心世界的展示，不仅对丰富人物的形象是必要的，而且对于增强整个影片的诗意起着很大的作用。
    聂耳首先是一个革命者，然后才是一个音乐家。而聂耳进行革命活动的最主要的武器就是他的音乐创作。因此，塑造聂耳的形象，除了需要展示他其他方面的生活和斗争经历，展示他各种行动的内在动机之外，必然要着重地表现他的音乐创作活动，特别是创作过程中的内心活动。
    影片没有孤立地表现聂耳一些名曲的创作过程。而是把这些歌曲的酝酿和成熟，同聂耳整个的革命活动，以及聂耳在革命活动中的内心感受有机地结合在一起，这是十分正确的。本来，聂耳的创作绝不是什么神秘的“灵感”的爆发，而是人民生活在这位革命音乐家头脑中反映的产物。我们可以说，聂耳短短的一生，就是一首瑰丽的交响曲。这首交响曲在影片开始之前就已经在鸣响了，不过，我们可以看到，只是在革命的音符出现在他生命的乐章里以后，这首交响曲才开始发出炫目的光彩。只是在找到了党，参加了革命活动之后，革命的风云雷电才开始成为他生命的旋律。于是，在淞沪抗日战争的炮火中，在英勇地抢救伤员的时候，聂耳的心里萌发了“冒着敌人的炮火，前进！”最初的乐思。而“五花歌舞班”流浪生活的切身感受，使他在《铁蹄下的歌女》里抒发了感时忧国的激愤之情。在《扬子江暴风雨》里，他开始谱出了劳动人民的情感。这是聂耳与工人阶级的命运越来越不可分割的标志。在《国际歌》事件中，聂耳的拳头在墙上击出了血痕，他在敌人的刺刀林里演奏出《国际歌》，他的感情像洪水一样不可阻挡。聂耳的申请入党和他在长城上的感受，进一步形成了《义勇军进行曲》未来的胚胎，而当苏平通知他入党申请已被批准的时候，聂耳用在钢琴上的弹奏来宣泄他的喜悦，虽然没有一句表白，我们却完全可以和他的内心发生共鸣。正是在火热的斗争中酝酿了整整的三年，我们的聂耳才终于在一个晚上谱成了我们最心爱的、振奋斗志的、现在成为我们伟大祖国代国歌的《义勇军进行曲》。在聂耳谱这支歌曲时，银幕上所展现的那些场景：闸北的炮火，示威的队伍，烈士的就义，长征的红旗，一个个化成了激越的音符。这是现实主义吗？是的，这才是革命的现实主义，这是对中华民族血与火的斗争现实的最真实的概括！这是浪漫主义吗？是的，这才是革命的浪漫主义，燃烧在聂耳内心里的是革命理想的烈火，是中国人民必获解放的预告，革命的风云雷电在音乐家的笔下谱成了中国人民革命的雄歌。在这位人民音乐家的内心世界里激荡着亿万人民的革命风暴，人们又怎能分得清那一部分是客观的现实，那一部分是主观的灵感！
    《聂耳》的成就是多方面的。在这篇观后感里，只涉及了影片的文学部分，很希望有别的同志从其他方面来评论影片的优异成就。
