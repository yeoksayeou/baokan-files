    Pick Up Your Machetes and Fight Them
    —An Introduction to the Costa Rican Novel "Green Hell"
    Wang Shoupeng
    "Green Hell" is a novel depicting the tragic lives of Costa Rican banana workers under the exploitation of the United Fruit Company. The people of Latin America grind their teeth in hatred at the mention of the American United Fruit Company. The degree of cruelty and barbarity in the exploitation, plunder, and oppression of the people of Latin America, especially the people of Central America, by this infamous American imperialist monopoly enterprise is appalling. Since its establishment in 1899, the United Fruit Company has seized vast amounts of land in Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, and other places, established plantations, and forced local people to engage in slave labor. They controlled transportation lines such as highways, railways, and seaports, causing these countries to only produce single crops such as bananas, cocoa, and coffee, completely monopolizing their economic lifelines. Every year, countless laborers are drained of their blood and sweat, lose their lives, and countless sums of money are stuffed into the pockets of American monopoly capitalists. The American imperialists regard the political and economic sovereignty of these countries as the private property of the United Fruit Company, to be slaughtered at will. If the people of these countries rise up slightly to defend their rights, or if they come into slight conflict with the interests of the United Fruit Company, they will suffer a poisonous hand. But the United Fruit Company deceives the world, claiming that the local workers employed by the company can get "generous wages", enjoy various "welfare measures", and have "hospitals with modern equipment" to treat workers, etc. "Green Hell," a novel by Costa Rican worker-writer Carlos Luis Fallas, thoroughly exposes the truth about the United Fruit Company's cruel exploitation and bloody oppression of Costa Rican workers, and punctures their lies.

    The protagonist of the novel, José Francisco, and his companions, Eminio and Calero, work on the construction site of a railway for the United Fruit Company. They work like slaves in the hot jungle and swamp areas, eating rotten bananas, black beans, and rice, and drinking swamp water. At night, swarms of mosquitoes bite them, preventing them from falling asleep. They work hard in the sweat, and take quinine if they get malaria; they drown their sorrows in alcohol in a miserable and depressed life. Their companion, Baitingle, wants to save some money to go home and live, but in the end he is empty-handed. The little bit of meager wages he gets is also taken away by the company's stores in various ways. The only "welfare measure" the company gives them is the inferior liquor that anesthetizes the workers. The author writes angrily: "Liquor flows like a spring on the plantation, and the workers exchange their blood for the sweet wine sold in the company. Those cannibals who live on distant Wall Street have their safes stuffed with gold coins, which are covered with tears and sweat, covered with bloody sputum, and faintly carrying terrified shouts, and also exuding the stench of pus, rotten bones, and inferior wine." In this swampy area, with the arrival of American monopoly capitalists, terrible diseases such as malignant malaria, scabies, and boils are prevalent. Quinine is more important than food here, and one cannot do without it for a day; the harm of boils is even greater, and can rot people alive. Many men and women rot to death in the banana plantations in the swamps. A worker's life is not even worth a bunch of bananas. The day to pay wages comes, and the cunning foreman runs away with the money. Eminio goes to the company to reason, but is beaten up. Their three names are blacklisted, and they have to escape to another banana plantation to work. They open up land for this banana plantation in the primitive jungle. Their friend Calero is crushed to death while cutting down trees, but the Americans do not allow him to be buried, and let the corpse rot in the banana plantation as fertilizer. Those who fertilize the banana plantations are more than just Calero, I don't know how many people's bones have fertilized this land, including the bones of Nicaraguans, the bones of Costa Ricans, the bones of blacks, and the bones of all the workers! Under the burning anger, Eminio cuts the foreman with a knife and is thrown into prison. José Francisco wanders around looking for new work. The three friends parted ways in this way.

    The third part of the novel describes the reunion of the protagonist José Francisco and his friend Eminio. After more than ten years of separation, José Francisco is very different from before. He has participated in strikes, been in prison, and learned a lot in prison. Now he is fighting for a better future for his motherland. In the years of struggle, José Francisco has seen the true face of the American imperialist United Fruit Company and its lackeys, and has realized a truth: the people must unite and completely overthrow the rule of imperialism and its running dogs in order to be liberated.

    The novel describes José Francisco going to Terra Menga as an election supervisor of the worker-peasant united front to supervise the election. This is a deceptive trick played by the agents of American imperialism in Costa Rica. The worker-peasant united front is the only opposition party that nominated candidates in this election, so the ruling party tried every means to prevent him from participating in the supervision of the election. He took a great risk and relied on his wit and courage to find the election location that the ruling party had secretly moved. It is the residence of the Terra Menga Indians. These Indians, who have always been abandoned in the remote mountains and dense forests, suddenly, government officials and politicians come to their door, invite them to a full meal, get them drunk, give them tobacco, and urge them to fall asleep, in order to deceive them of their votes. The deceived Indians cast their votes under threats and inducements, or simply let a few bought drunkards vote on behalf of everyone. After José Francisco came back, he talked about this "election" with a banana worker:
     "When they manipulate and control these votes, do you think the people can be liberated through elections?"
    "We have no choice but to pick up our machetes and fight them!" The man clenched his fist and shouted loudly.
    "Pick up your machetes and fight them!" This is the cry of the Costa Rican people against American imperialism. Facts have proved that the national democratic movement of the Costa Rican people is on the rise. The great strike of more than 10,000 banana workers in 1953 shut down twenty-nine large banana plantations of the United Fruit Company on the Pacific coast, forcing American monopoly capitalists to make some concessions. The president Ulate, a loyal lackey of the United Fruit Company, was also driven off the stage. In 1955, the American imperialists conspired to subvert President Figueres, suppress the people's movement, and instigated rebel elements to launch an armed attack from Nicaragua, which also suffered a shameful defeat under the united counterattack of the Costa Rican people. The Costa Rican people, together with all the people of Latin America, will surely achieve final victory in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

    拿起砍刀跟他们干
    ——介绍哥斯达黎加小说《绿地狱》
    王寿彭
    《绿地狱》是一本描写哥斯达黎加香蕉工人在美国联合果品公司压榨下的悲惨生活的小说。提起美国的联合果品公司，拉丁美洲的人民是切齿痛恨的。这家臭名昭彰的美帝国主义垄断企业，对拉丁美洲人民，特别是对中美洲各国人民的剥削、掠夺和压迫，其残酷、野蛮的程度，是骇人听闻的。这个联合果品公司于1899年成立后，六十年来，在洪都拉斯、哥斯达黎加、危地马拉、尼加拉瓜、巴拿马等地，霸占大量土地，开辟种植园，驱使当地人民为他们从事奴隶的劳动。他们控制公路、铁路、海港等运输线，使这些国家只生产香蕉、可可、咖啡等单一作物，把经济命脉完全垄断在他们手里。每年不知有多少劳动者被吸干了血汗，丧失了生命，不知有多少金元装进了美国垄断资本家的钱袋。美帝国主义者把这些国家的政治、经济主权，看作是联合果品公司的私产，任意宰割。这些国家的人民只要稍稍起来维护自己的一点点权利，与联合果品公司的利益稍有抵触，就会遭到毒手。但联合果品公司却欺世骗人，说什么这家公司雇用的当地工人可以得到“优厚的工资”，享有种种“福利措施”，设有
  “现代化设备的医院”，为工人治病等等。哥斯达黎加的工人作家卡洛斯·路易斯·法拉斯写的长篇小说《绿地狱》，彻底揭露了联合果品公司残酷剥削、血腥压迫哥斯达黎加工人的真相，戳穿了他们的谎言。
    小说的主角何塞·弗兰西斯珂和同伴埃密尼奥与卡莱罗一起在联合果品公司修筑铁路的工地上工作。他们在炎热的林莽沼泽地带像奴隶一样地干活，吃的是腐臭的香蕉、黑豆和大米，喝的是沼泽地的污水，晚上成群的蚊子叮得不能入睡。他们流着汗干活，生了疟疾就吞服奎宁；在悲惨、苦闷的生活中，借酒浇愁。他们的同伴白亭勒想积一笔钱回家过活，但是到头来是两手空空，他得到的一点点微薄的工资，也被公司的店铺用种种方法剥夺了去。公司给他们的唯一的“福利措施”，便是麻醉工人的劣质烧酒。作者愤怒地写道：“烧酒像泉水一样在种植园上奔流，工人们用他们的鲜血换来了公司里出售的甜酒。住在遥远的华尔街上那些吃人的生番，他们的保险箱里却塞满了金元，钱上涂满了眼泪和汗水，涂满了带着血丝的浓痰，也隐隐带着恐惧的叫喊，还散发着脓水、腐骨和劣酒的臭气。”在这个沼泽地带，伴随着美国垄断资本家的到来，流行着恶性疟疾、疥疮、毒疮等可怕的疾病。在这里奎宁比粮食还要紧，一天也缺少不得；毒疮的为害更大，能把人活活地烂死，许多男男女女烂死在沼泽地的香蕉园中。一个工人的生命还不及一串香蕉值钱。发工资的日子到了，奸诈的工头带着钱逃跑了。埃密尼奥去找公司讲理，却被毒打了一顿。他们三个人的名字上了黑名单，不得不逃到另一个香蕉园去干活。他们给这个香蕉园在原始林莽中开辟土地。他们的朋友卡莱罗在砍伐树木时被活活压死，但美国佬不准葬埋，让尸体烂在香蕉园里做肥料。给那些香蕉园做肥料的人何止卡莱罗一个，不知有多少人的白骨喂肥了这里的土地，其中有尼加拉瓜人的白骨，哥斯达黎加人的白骨，黑人的白骨，和所有工人们的白骨！埃密尼奥在怒火燃烧下，用刀把工头砍伤了，他被关进了监狱。何塞·法兰西斯珂又到处流浪，寻找新的活干。这三个朋友就这样分了手。
    小说的第三部描写了主角何塞·弗兰西斯珂和他的朋友埃密尼奥的重逢。分别了十几年后，何塞·弗兰西斯珂已经与以前大不相同，他参加过罢工，坐过监狱，在监狱里学习到了很多东西，现在他正为了他祖国美好的未来而斗争。何塞·弗兰西斯珂在几年的斗争中，看清了美帝国主义的联合果品公司和它所豢养的走狗的真面目，认识到了一个真理，那就是：人民必需团结起来，彻底推翻帝国主义及其走狗的统治，才能得到解放。
    小说描写了何塞·弗兰西斯珂以工农联合阵线的监选员身份，到泰拉孟加去监督选举的情况。这是美帝国主义在哥斯达黎加的代理人所玩弄的骗人把戏。工农联合阵线是这次选举中提出候选人的唯一反对党，因此，执政党就想尽种种办法，阻挠他去参加监选。他冒了很大危险，靠着他的机智果敢，才找到了执政党暗中迁移的选举地点。那里是泰拉孟加印第安人的聚居地，这些从来被遗弃在荒山密林中的印第安人，突然间，政府官员和政客们都上门来找他们，请他们饱吃一顿，灌得他们酩酊大醉，送给他们烟草，催他们入眠，以骗取他们的选票。被欺骗的印第安人在威胁利诱之下投了票，或者就干脆只让几个被收买的醉汉代替所有的人投票。何塞·弗兰西斯珂回来后，和一个香蕉工人谈起这场“选举”说：
      “在他们操纵和控制这些选票的时候，你认为人民可以通过选举而获得解放吗？”
    “我们只有拿起砍刀跟他们干，此外没有别的办法！”那人握紧拳头，高声地喊。
    “拿起砍刀跟他们干！”这是哥斯达黎加人民反抗美帝国主义的呼声。事实证明，哥斯达黎加人民的民族民主运动正在日益高涨。1953年一万多香蕉工人的大罢工，使联合果品公司在太平洋岸的二十九个大香蕉园停工，迫使美国垄断资本家不得不做某些让步，联合果品公司的忠实走狗总统乌拉特也被赶下了台。1955年，美帝国主义者阴谋颠复菲格雷斯总统，镇压人民运动，唆使叛乱分子从尼加拉瓜进行的武装进攻，也在哥斯达黎加人民团结一致的反击下，遭到了可耻的失败。哥斯达黎加人民和拉丁美洲全体人民在一起，在反帝国主义反殖民主义的斗争中，必将得到最后胜利。
