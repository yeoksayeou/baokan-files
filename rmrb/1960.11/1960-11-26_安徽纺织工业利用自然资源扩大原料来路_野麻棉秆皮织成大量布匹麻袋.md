Anhui Province's textile industry departments are widely utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers such as cotton stalk skin, Apocynum venetum, Smilax china, wild ramie, and Wisteria sinensis bark for spinning and weaving. According to incomplete statistics from Hefei, Anqing, Bengbu, Wuhu, and Fuyang, since July of this year, these regions have produced a total of more than 5,260 pieces of various cotton yarns, more than 2.8 million meters of various industrial cloths and packaging cloths, 298,000 sacks, and more than 200,000 meters of burlap by blending wild and miscellaneous fibers with cotton and hemp, or by pure spinning. Many factories also utilize the waste materials and liquids generated from processing fibers to produce large quantities of tannin extract, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, starch, feed, papermaking raw materials, and other items.

Anhui Province is rich in wild and miscellaneous fiber resources. After inspection and identification, there are more than 250 kinds of fibrous plants that can be used as textile raw materials, with an annual output of more than 1.8 billion jin. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and local Party committees attach great importance to the work of utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers. Various localities have formulated plans for the utilization of wild and miscellaneous fibers based on resource conditions and have established offices to lead this work. In addition to establishing degumming workshops (or groups) and actively utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers, textile factories in various places have also partnered with people's communes to help them establish more than 150 comprehensive utilization and processing organizations for wild and miscellaneous fibers in terms of technology and equipment.

In the process of utilizing wild and miscellaneous fibers, relevant units in various localities have vigorously promoted collaboration and continuously innovated technologies, and have solved a series of technical problems such as peeling, degumming, carding, cutting, and weaving. More than 1,400 peeling machines, fiber cutting machines, carding machines, separators, degumming machines, etc., have been imitated and created using waste materials in various places. The degumming assembly line built by the machine repair workshop of Anhui No. 1 Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory can process 200 jin of fiber per hour, which is more than 200 times more efficient than manual operation. With the continuous improvement of technical levels, the proportion of wild and miscellaneous fibers mixed in per 100 jin of raw cotton in various textile factories has gradually increased from 25% at the beginning to about 50% to 75%. The fineness of the yarn has been improved from the initial 6 counts to 14 counts, 16 counts, and even 42 counts. The proportion of wild and miscellaneous fibers mixed in per 100 jin of hemp has also increased from 33% at the beginning to 50% to 100%. Textile factories in various places have used wild and miscellaneous fibers to weave many kinds of fabrics with soft texture and bright colors, such as yarn flannel, youth poplin, jacquard poplin, printed cloth, imitation cashmere, and serge, which are welcomed by consumers.

At present, Anhui is vigorously collecting wild fibers. By the beginning of November, the province had collected 16.6 million jin of wild fibers, an increase of 38% over the same period last year.

    安徽纺织工业利用自然资源扩大原料来路
    野麻棉秆皮织成大量布匹麻袋
    安徽省纺织工业部门广泛利用棉秆皮、罗布麻、南蛇藤、野麻、纠藤皮等野杂纤维纺纱织布。据合肥、安庆、蚌埠、芜湖、阜阳等地的不完全统计，从今年7月份以来利用野杂纤维同棉、麻混纺或纯纺，共生产各种棉纱五千二百六十多件，各种工业用布、包装用布等二百八十多万米，麻袋二十九万八千条，麻包布二十多万米。许多厂还利用加工纤维产生的废料、废液，制出大量栲胶、化肥、农药、淀粉、饲料、造纸原料等物品。
    安徽省野杂纤维资源丰富，经检查鉴定，能用作纺织原料的纤维植物有二百五十多种，年产量达十八亿多斤。中共安徽省委和各地党委都很重视利用野杂纤维的工作。各地根据资源等条件，制订了利用野杂纤维的规划，成立了领导这一工作的办公室。各纺织厂除建立脱胶车间（或组），积极利用野杂纤维外，还同人民公社挂钩，从技术、设备等方面帮助公社建立起野杂纤维综合利用加工组织一百五十多个。
    各地有关单位在利用野杂纤维的过程中，大搞协作，不断革新技术，已经解决了剥皮、脱胶、弹梳、切断、纺织等一系列技术问题。各地用废旧材料仿制和创制的剥皮机、切纤维机、弹梳机、分离机、脱胶机等，已有一千四百多台。安徽第一纺织印染厂机修车间建成的脱胶流水作业线，每小时可以处理纤维二百斤，比手工操作提高工效二百多倍。随着技术水平的不断提高，各纺织厂在每百斤原棉中掺用野杂纤维的比例由开始时的25％，逐渐增加到50％到75％左右，纱的细度由初期的六支提高到十四支、十六支直至四十二支；每百斤麻掺用野杂纤维的比例，也由开始时的33％增加到50％至100％。各地纺织厂用野杂纤维织出了许多种质地柔软、色彩绚丽的纱方呢、青年罗、提花府绸、印花布、仿啥米呢、哔叽等织物，受到了广大消费者的欢迎。
    目前，安徽各地正在大力采集野生纤维。到11月初，全省已经采集野生纤维一千六百六十万斤，比去年同期增加38％。
