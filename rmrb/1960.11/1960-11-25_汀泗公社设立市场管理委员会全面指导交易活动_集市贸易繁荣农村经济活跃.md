    Tingsi Commune Establishes Market Management Committee to Comprehensively Guide Trading Activities
    Market Trade Flourishes, Rural Economy Active
    (Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, November 24th) The rural market trade markets in Tingsi People's Commune, Xianning County, Hubei Province, are flourishing under the leadership of state-owned commerce, playing a positive role in activating the rural economy and promoting agricultural production.
    Tingsi Bridge Town, located in the center of the commune area and adjacent to the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, is the largest market town in Tingsi Commune, Xianning County. Since the development of market trade, the town has presented a scene of prosperity. Especially during commune members' regular holidays, male and female commune members from various production teams happily pull rubber-wheeled carts, push "chicken carts," carry baskets, and bring their own agricultural and sideline products—vitex twigs, firewood, vegetables, chickens, ducks, poultry eggs, fresh fish, hunted game, medicinal herbs, and household handicraft products such as bamboo baskets, brooms, and sieves—from all directions, continuously converging on the market town. Commune members trade with each other according to their needs. The trading activities on the town's streets and alleys are very active. After selling their agricultural and sideline products to each other or to state-owned stores, they purchase fabrics, daily necessities, and small farm tools according to their wishes.
    Tingsi People's Commune conscientiously implements the Party's various policies, organizing market trade in a planned and guided manner to invigorate the rural economy. Except for materials subject to state monopoly purchase and marketing, production teams, production groups, and commune members can bring surplus products to the market for trading after fulfilling their sales quotas to the state. The commune also encourages commune members to cultivate their private plots well, reclaim scattered land around their houses, grow vegetables and coarse grains, and raise pigs and poultry during holidays and spare time, under the premise of actively carrying out collective production. The commune also organizes commune members to go into the mountains to collect various local specialties, produce various small commodities, and develop sideline production, increasing commune members' income, based on the characteristics of abundant mountain products. After successfully completing the autumn sowing plan this year, the Red Star Third Production Team mobilized commune members to go up the mountains and down to the lakes to collect wild medicinal herbs, cut small bamboo and wood, catch fish and shrimp, and hunt wild animals. After fulfilling the plan for selling to the state, they took the surplus products to the market for trade, increasing a large amount of income. In addition to paying wages to commune members on a monthly basis and adding various farm tools such as plows, rakes, shovels, and hoes, they also saved more than 6,800 yuan.
    The market trade of Tingsi People's Commune is carried out under the leadership of state-owned commerce. The commune has established a market management committee in the market trade market to comprehensively guide market trading activities. State-owned stores can purchase products that commune members cannot sell in the market at the listed price, so that commune members do not have to carry goods back and forth and waste time. In order to help commune members broaden the avenues for sideline production and expand the variety of trading, the central store of the commune sent a group of employees to the production teams and production groups to display samples, mark prices, and explain uses to the commune members, stimulating the enthusiasm of commune members to engage in sideline production. In order to facilitate commune members' purchases and sales in the market, state-owned commerce has also added purchasing and sales points in the market, and has made proper arrangements for commune members' lives, entertainment, and rest when they go to the market, which is welcomed by commune members participating in market trade.

    汀泗公社设立市场管理委员会全面指导交易活动
    集市贸易繁荣农村经济活跃
    本报武汉24日电　湖北省咸宁县汀泗人民公社的农村集市贸易市场，在国营商业的领导
  下，繁荣兴旺，对活跃农村经济，促进农业生产起了积极的作用。
    位居公社地区中心、紧靠京广铁路的汀泗桥镇，是咸宁县汀泗公社最大的集镇。集市贸易开展以来，市镇一派繁荣景象。特别是每逢社员例假休息，各生产队的男女社员高高兴兴地拉着胶轮板车，推着“鸡公车”，挑筐提篮，带着自己生产的和采集的农副土特产品——黄荆条、木柴、蔬菜、鸡、鸭、禽蛋、鲜鱼、狩猎物、药材，以及家庭手工业品如竹篮、扫帚、筛子等，从四面八方，络绎不绝地汇集到集镇市场来。社员们根据自己的需要，相互进行交易。镇上大街小巷交易活动十分活跃。他们自行交易或向国营商店出售自己的农副土特产品以后，又按照自己的心意购买布匹、日用品和小型农具。
    汀泗人民公社认真贯彻执行党的各项政策，有领导有计划地组织集市贸易，活跃农村经济。除国家统购统销的物资以外，其他农副产品，生产队、生产小队和社员在完成向国家交售的任务以后，多余产品都可以拿到集市上交易。公社并鼓励社员在积极搞好集体生产的前提下，利用假日和工余时间，种好自留地，开垦屋前屋后的零星地，种植蔬菜、杂粮，饲养猪和家禽。公社还根据山区物产丰富的特点，有计划地组织社员上山采集各种土特产品，生产各种小商品，发展副业生产，增加社员收入。红星第三生产队今年在出色地完成秋种计划之后，发动社员上山下湖，采集野生药材，伐小竹木，捕鱼虾、打野物，在完成向国家交售的计划之后，把多余产品拿到集市上参加贸易，增加了大批收入，除按月给社员发工资、添置犁、耙、锹、锄等多种农具以外，还节余六千八百多元。
    汀泗人民公社的集市贸易是在国营商业领导下进行的。公社在集市贸易市场设立了市场管理委员会，全面指导市场的交易活动。社员在集市贸易市场上卖不出去的产品，国营商店可以按照牌价收购，使社员不致携带商品往返和浪费时间。国营商业为了帮助社员广开副业生产门路，扩大交易品种，公社中心商店派出一批职工下到生产队、生产小队，向社员们展出样品、标明价格，讲清用途，激励了社员从事副业生产的积极性。为了便利社员在集市上购销，国营商业还在集市上增设了购销点，并对社员赶集时的生活、娱乐、休息都作了妥善安排，受到参加集市贸易的社员的欢迎。
