Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to a report by the German News Agency, two thousand machinists in Cologne, West Germany, held a two-and-a-half-hour strike on the 25th to protest the false reports on West German television programs that whitewashed their living conditions.

Workers at this machine factory, which belongs to the Klöckner concern, expressed anger at the depiction of their lives in many television scenes as being very beautiful. Some scenes showed workers going to work with noble briefcases like those used by diplomats, while also receiving bags of high wages.

The workers confirmed that the so-called high wages in the television program included overtime pay given to workers after they had worked a lot of overtime. And those beautiful briefcases were given to the workers in advance by the television cameramen.

    不满电视节目粉饰劳工生活
    西德科隆工人举行抗议罢工
    新华社讯　据德意志通讯社报道：西德科隆二千机械工人在25日举行两小时半罢工，抗议西德电视节目粉饰他们生活情况的假报道。
    这家属于克勒克内康采恩的机械厂的工人对许多电视镜头中把他们的生活描写得非常美好表示愤怒。有些镜头出现工人们夹着像外交官用的高贵的公文包去上班，同时他们还收到一袋袋高额的工资。
    工人们证实，电视节目中所谓的高额工资，是把让工人大大加班加点之后给的加班费包括到工资中去了。而那些漂亮的公文包是电视摄影记者事先发给工人的。
