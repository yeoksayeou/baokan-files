Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 9th - Castro called on the Cuban people on the evening of the 8th to prepare to crush the armed aggression and economic blockade of American imperialism. At the closing session of the seven trade union congresses, which ended this morning, he said, "We should make it clear to the enemies of the revolution that, just as we are prepared to fight against military aggression and crush it, we are also prepared to fight against economic aggression, blockades, and starvation campaigns."

Castro pointed out that "domestic and foreign reactionaries are unwilling to see the victory of the revolution and are attempting to make the revolution fail." He condemned the recent aggressive activities of American imperialism: sending Marines to the Caimanera Naval Base and organizing military exercises there, and concentrating mercenaries, military equipment, and aircraft in Guatemala in order to invade Cuba. He said that one of the consistent targets of attack is the Isle of Pines. Castro also condemned the United States' attempts to deprive the Cuban people of food. He said that a few weeks ago, a ship transporting 50,000 quintals of potatoes and beans from Canada to Havana was forced by American forces to unload its cargo in Puerto Rico. He said, "Imperialism is not only a shameless, hypocritical pharisee, but also a murderer and an accomplice to all barbarous and murderous acts. Imperialism is not only a shameless, hypocritical pharisee, but also a pirate and a bandit." He said that in Cuba, a people's army is being organized with the strength of all. Tens of thousands of men and women will advance with their weapons and bullets. These weapons are to eliminate those who dare to set foot on our land. He pointed out that in the past two weeks, the revolutionary military forces have greatly increased.

In his speech, he emphasized that "the people should understand that having a strong force, being well organized, and being well prepared will help prevent imperialist aggression." He said, "We should not sleep on rockets, so as not to create a tendency to pursue comfort in the minds of the people, so as not to paralyze the spirit of resistance of our people."

He also said that, moreover, if we hope that it will never be necessary to use rockets, we have a way to contribute: that is, to make ourselves strong. He said: "Weakness is tantamount to inviting the enemy to attack us."

He went on to point out that when the enemy "believes they cannot occupy our island in twenty-four hours, then the possibility of aggression will be reduced. If we cannot put up a tenacious and invincible resistance from the first second, then international support alone will be useless."

He once again emphasized that, therefore, we should not sleep on rockets, but rely on our own strength.

Castro said, "For the workers, weapons in the past were a symbol of oppression. Now the revolution has handed weapons over to the workers. The workers understand that weapons can only serve to defend the interests of our class and our people."

When talking about the American economic blockade, Castro also emphasized that Cuba must defend itself with its own production plan. He expounded on the country's economic situation and the importance of forming and increasing technical personnel.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 9th - A rally of about 20,000 people was held last night at the Havana stadium to celebrate the closing of the recent Seven Trade Union Congresses held in Havana. The conference once again demonstrated the firm determination of the Cuban working people to defend their motherland, increase production, and counter American aggression.

The meeting place was hung with huge banners, which read: "Rather die than lose our homeland," "We will win," "To defend the revolution, we unite closely," "Repay every aggression with better production," "Salute the 43rd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution," "Salute the delegation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions," "American imperialism is our common enemy, our struggle should also be common," "Long live the great unity of the world's workers," etc.

Cuban Prime Minister Castro spoke at the meeting and accepted on behalf of the government checks for approximately 145,000 pesos donated by various workers' organizations to purchase weapons and aircraft and to promote land reform.

The representatives of the various trade union federations emphasized in their speeches at the meeting that it is extremely necessary to always be vigilant against the enemy and at the same time strive to increase production. They expressed the determination of the Cuban workers to defend and advance the revolution, and supported the nationalization of American enterprises in Cuba.

Kang Yonghe, head of the Chinese trade union delegation visiting Cuba, also spoke at the meeting. He extended his respects to the Cuban workers and people on behalf of the Chinese workers. He expressed his belief that the Cuban workers and people, who overthrew the U.S.-backed Batista dictatorship, with firm revolutionary determination, will certainly be able to defeat any U.S. economic blockade, defeat any armed aggression by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and advance the Cuban revolution. He said: The working people of Cuba and China have suffered the same hardships in the past and are now standing on the same front to fight against American imperialism. The Chinese workers will, in the spirit of mutual support and solidarity, always stand by the Cuban workers and people. As long as it is necessary, the Chinese working class will do everything in its power to help the Cuban people. His words aroused thunderous applause.

Kang Yonghe, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, presented the Cuban Workers' Confederation with a banner and a donation of 2,000 pounds sterling (equivalent to 5,600 pesos) for cultural, educational and other purposes.

Jesus Soto, the organizing secretary of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, accepted the banner and donation and expressed his gratitude on behalf of the Cuban workers. He said that this action by the Chinese delegation clearly demonstrated the great international support for the Cuban people's struggle against American imperialism. (Attached picture)

    卡斯特罗在哈瓦那工会集会上强调指出
    古巴人民应靠自己的力量抵抗美国侵略
    康永和说中国工人将永远站在古巴工人和人民的一边
    新华社哈瓦那9日电　卡斯特罗8日晚上号召古巴人民进行准备，以便击溃美帝国主义的武装侵略和经济封锁。他在这个今天早上才结束的七个工人联合会代表大会的闭幕会议上说，“我们应该让革命的敌人清楚地看到，正像我们准备好为反对军事侵略而斗争并且把它击溃一样，我们也准备为反对经济侵略及封锁和饥饿运动而斗争。”
    卡斯特罗指出，“国内外反动派不甘心看到革命的胜利，企图使革命遭到失败。”他谴责美帝国主义最近进行的侵略活动：派遣海军陆战队到卡伊马内拉海军基地并在那里组织军事演习，以及在危地马拉集中雇佣兵、军事装备和飞机，以便入侵古巴。他说，一贯成为进攻目标之一的是松树岛。卡斯特罗还谴责美国甚至企图剥夺古巴人民的粮食。他说，几个星期前，从加拿大运输五万公担的土豆和豆类到哈瓦那的一艘船被美国势力强迫在波多黎各卸货。他说，“帝国主义不仅是无耻的假仁假义的伪善者，而且也是杀人犯和一切野蛮和谋杀行为的同谋者。帝国主义不仅是无耻的假仁假义的伪善者，而且也是海盗和匪徒。”他说，在古巴，正在用所有人的力量组织一支人民军队。成千上万男人和妇女将带着他们的武器和子弹前进。这些武器是为了消灭那些胆敢踏上我国土地的人们。他指出，在最近两个星期内，革命的军事力量已经大大增长了。
    他在讲话中强调指出，“人民应该懂得，拥有强大的力量很好地组织起来和做好准备将有利于防止帝国主义侵略。”他说，“我们不应该在火箭上睡大觉，以便不要在人民的精神中造成一种追求舒适的倾向，以便不麻痹我国人民的抵抗精神。”
    他还说，此外，假如我们希望永远没有必要使用火箭的话，我们是有办法做出贡献的：就是使自己强大有力。他说：“软弱就等于请敌人来攻击我们。”
    他接着指出，当敌人“相信他们不能在二十四小时之内占领我们的岛屿的时候，那末侵略的可能性就会减小。如果我们不能从第一秒钟起就进行顽强的不可战胜的抵抗，那末光有国际支援也是没有用处的”。
    他再一次强调说，因此，不应该在火箭上睡大觉，应该依靠我们自己的力量。
    卡斯特罗说，“对工人来说，武器在过去是压迫的象征。现在革命把武器交给了工人。工人懂得，武器只可能为保卫我们的阶级和我国人民的利益服务。”
    卡斯特罗在谈到美国的经济封锁时还强调指出，古巴要用自己的生产计划来自卫。他阐述了国家的经济状况以及组成和增加技术人员的重要意义。
    据新华社哈瓦那9日电　昨天晚上在哈瓦那体育馆举行了约有两万人参加的大会，庆祝最近刚在哈瓦那举行的七个工人联合会代表大会的闭幕。这次大会再次表明了古巴劳动人民保卫祖国、增加生产、反击美国侵略的坚定决心。
    集会会场悬挂着巨幅标语，上面写着：“没有祖国毋宁死”，“我们必胜”，“为了捍卫革命，我们紧紧地团结起来”，“以更好的生产来回击每一个侵略”，“向十月社会主义革命四十三周年纪念致敬”，“向中华人民共和国工会代表团致敬”，“美帝国主义是我们共同的敌人，我们的斗争也应当是共同的”，“世界工人大团结万岁”等。
    古巴总理卡斯特罗在这个会议上讲了话，并代表政府接受了各工人组织捐献购买武器、飞机和推进土地改革的大约十四万五千比索的支票。
    各工人联合会的代表在大会上的发言中都强调指出，经常对敌人保持警惕，同时努力增加生产，这是极其必要的。他们表示了古巴工人保卫和推进革命的决心，并且支持把在古巴的美国企业收归国有。
    正在古巴访问的中国工会代表团团长康永和也在大会上讲了话。他代表中国工人向古巴工人和人民致敬。他表示相信，推翻了美国支持的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的古巴工人和人民，以坚定的革命决心，一定能够挫败美国的任何经济封锁，击败美帝国主义及其走狗的任何武装侵略，并且使古巴革命向前发展。他说：古巴和中国的劳动人民在过去遭受过同样的苦难，现在站在同一条战线上向美帝国主义进行斗争。中国工人将本着相互支援和团结的精神，永远站在古巴工人和人民的一边。只要有必要，中国工人阶级将尽一切力量来帮助古巴人民。他的话引起了雷鸣般的掌声。
    康永和代表中华全国总工会向古巴工人联合会赠送了锦旗和赠款两千英镑（合五千六百比索）供文化、教育和其他方面之用。
    古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托接受了锦旗和赠款，并以古巴工人的名义表示感谢。他说，中国代表团的这个行动清楚地表明了对古巴人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的伟大国际支援。（附图片）
