    Advanced Dragon Train
    "Advanced Dragon Train" is a train that goes directly to key enterprises. In the past, freight trains generally had to be disassembled and reorganized at transfer and terminal stations. After implementing "one-stop" transportation, although it saved the procedures of disassembly and reorganization at transfer stations, which was very beneficial to accelerating vehicle turnover, there were still shortcomings. For example, coal transported from Fuxin to various users in Shenyang was initially compiled together regardless of the type of coal or the user; upon arrival at Sujiatun Station in Shenyang, the entire train of coal cars would be disrupted, disassembled, and reorganized according to coal type and user, and then transferred to various enterprises. This resulted in the coal cars staying at Sujiatun Station for a long time. After the implementation of "Advanced Dragon Trains," Fuxin compiled coal cars of the same type and for the same user together and directly transported them to the coal-using enterprises. This further reduced the time spent on operations at the terminal station. For example, coal cars going directly from Fuxin to Anshan Iron and Steel (An'gang) are loaded and depart from the coal preparation plant of the Fuxin Coal Mine, and go directly to the front of the coal storage of the gas generator station of An'gang to unload. The Sujiatun transfer station in Shenyang and the Lingshan terminal station in Anshan, through which the coal cars pass, both saved the time for disassembly and reorganization operations, shortening the entire transit time from Fuxin to An'gang from the past seventeen hours to nine hours.

    高级龙车
    “高级龙车”是一种直达重点企业的列车。过去运货的火车，一般都要在中转站和终点站重新解体、编组。实行“一条龙”运输以后，虽然节省了中转站解体、编组的手续，对加速车辆周转等有很大好处，但还有美中不足之处。例如，从阜新运到沈阳各用户的煤炭，开始发车时，不分煤的品种，不管哪个用户，都编在一起；开到沈阳苏家屯车站，再把整列煤车打乱解体，重新按煤种、用户编组，分别转运到各个企业。这样，煤车在苏家屯车站停留的时间就很长。开行“高级龙车”以后，阜新把同一煤种、同一用户的煤车编在一起，直接开往用煤企业。这样就进一步节省了终点站的作业停留时间。例如，从阜新直达鞍钢的煤车，从阜新煤矿的选煤厂装车开出，直接到鞍钢煤气发生站的煤仓前面卸车。煤车经过的沈阳苏家屯中转站和鞍山的灵山终点站，都节省了解体、编组等作业时间，使阜新到鞍钢的整个运行时间，由过去的十七小时缩短为九小时。
