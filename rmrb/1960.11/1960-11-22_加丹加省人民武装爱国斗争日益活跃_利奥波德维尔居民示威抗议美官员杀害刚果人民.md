Xinhua News Agency, November 21st: Elisabethville dispatch: The patriotic armed struggle of the people of Katanga Province continues to develop.

According to a November 19th report, in Luena, a coal mining center in northern Katanga Province, the Baluba people, armed with sticks, bicycle chains, and bows and arrows, surrounded the city. It was previously reported that the Baluba people have been continuously attacking the Tshombe group's "administrative authorities" in Luena and have declared that they will reclaim the mines occupied by the colonialists.

In Kabalo, in the north, three teams of armed locals surrounded the "police headquarters" established there by the Tshombe traitorous group.

In another important stronghold, Kongolo, the heroic Baluba people fought against the reactionary troops of the Tshombe group.

Agence France-Presse said in a news report that "the entire northern part of Katanga Province is today rife with rebellion (referring to the people's armed struggle)", "The rebellion is particularly intense in the areas of Bakwanga, Manono, Luena, Kabongo, and Mukula. These areas include the entire border of Katanga Province with Kivu Province and Kasai Province, extending for two hundred and fifty kilometers into the interior of Katanga."

In order to intensify military suppression against the patriotic people, the Tshombe group announced that a "special military inspection command" will be established in Albertville in the northeast to uniformly command the reactionary troops in the Kongolo area and to send more troops there. Tshombe himself also went to Albertville and Kongolo to conduct activities.

The "United Nations forces" manipulated by the United States are also stepping up their intervention in the patriotic struggle of the people of Katanga Province. In Luena, the "United Nations forces" are forcibly disarming the people and wantonly arresting those who refuse to lay down their weapons. In Manono, the "United Nations forces" arrested four Africans and indicated that they would "punish" them.

The U.S. government has also sent senior officials to Katanga Province to conduct activities directly. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson arrived in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, on November 20th and held talks with Tshombe. Henderson later said that he had "frank and friendly" talks with Tshombe.

Xinhua News Agency, November 20th: Leopoldville dispatch: A group of angry Congolese residents held a demonstration near N’Djili Airport in Leopoldville today, protesting the brutal killing of a Congolese man by U.S. Embassy officials.

The report said that Carl Kaluokoski, Second Secretary of the U.S. Embassy in Congo, and Danan Milloro, a military attache, were driving to N’Djili Airport to see off U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson, who was in Congo for conspiratorial activities. At a place four miles from the airport, their car ran over and killed a Congolese man riding a bicycle on the side of the road. When they tried to escape after committing the crime, about twenty local residents immediately surrounded them and demonstrated against them. In extreme anger, the demonstrators beat the American murderers severely.

According to another report, Henderson, after carrying out a series of activities in Leopoldville, the capital of Congo, has already gone to Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga Province, which is occupied by the traitor Tshombe.

Henderson is leading a group of American "experts" to engage in large-scale activities in Africa in order to further penetrate American influence into Africa. According to reports, he had visited Cameroon, Gabon, and other countries before going to Congo.

    加丹加省人民武装爱国斗争日益活跃
    利奥波德维尔居民示威抗议美官员杀害刚果人民
    新华社21日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：加丹加省人民武装爱国斗争继续在发展。
    据19日消息，在加丹加省北部的煤矿中心卢埃纳，手持棍棒、自行车锁链和弓箭的巴卢巴人包围了这个城市。前已报道，巴卢巴人在卢埃纳不断袭击冲伯集团的“行政当局”，并宣布要收回被殖民者占据的矿山。
    在北部的卡巴洛，三队有武装的当地人包围了冲伯卖国集团设在那里的“警察总部”。
    在另一重要据点刚果罗，英勇的巴卢巴人曾同冲伯集团的反动军队进行战斗。
    法新社在一则消息中说，“加丹加省的整个北部今天到处蔓延着叛乱（指人民武装斗争）”，“在巴库马、马诺诺、卢埃纳、卡邦戈和穆库拉等地区，叛乱特别激烈。这些地区包括了加丹加省同基伍省与开赛省的全部边境，长达二百五十公里而伸展到加丹加内地”。
    冲伯集团为了对爱国人民加紧进行军事镇压，宣布将在东北部的阿尔伯特维尔成立一个“特别军事监察司令部”，统一指挥刚果罗地区的反动军队，并向那里增派军队。冲伯还亲自去阿尔伯特维尔和刚果罗等地活动。
    美国操纵的“联合国军”也在加紧干涉加丹加省人民的爱国斗争。在卢埃纳，“联合国军”在强行解除人民的武装，并大肆逮捕拒绝放下武器的人。在马诺诺，“联合国军”逮捕了四个非洲人，并表示要“处罚”他们。
    美国政府还派遣高级官员直接到加丹加省活动。美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊20日曾到达加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔，并同冲伯举行了会谈。汉德逊后来说，他同冲伯进行了“坦率和友好的”会谈。
    新华社20日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：一群愤怒的刚果居民今天在利奥波德维尔的恩吉利机场附近举行示威，抗议美国大使馆官员杀害一名刚果人的暴行。
    消息说，美国驻刚果大使馆二等秘书卡路克西和武官丹南密罗等人，当天驱汽车驰往恩吉利机场为到刚果进行阴谋活动的美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊送行。在离机场四英里的地方，他们的汽车竟然把一个在路边骑自行车的刚果人压死。他们犯罪后企图逃跑时，约二十多名当地居民立即包围了他们，向他们示威。在极端愤恨之下，示威者痛打了这些美国杀人犯。
    另据报道，汉德逊在刚果首都利奥波德维尔进行了一番活动以后，当天已前往叛国分子冲伯盘踞的加丹加省省会伊利沙伯维尔。
    汉德逊率领一批美国“专家”为美国势力进一步打入非洲，正在非洲大肆活动。据报道，在去刚果以前，他曾到过喀麦隆、加蓬等国。
