Xinhua News Agency, November 19th, Tunis dispatch: The Information Department of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria issued a communiqué on the 18th, condemning de Gaulle's new trick of planning to hold a "referendum" in France in the name of "reorganizing the public power of Algeria."

French officials recently announced that de Gaulle intends to propose a bill stipulating the establishment of a "provisional administrative body" in Algeria before exercising his so-called "self-determination," and to hold a "referendum" on this bill in France.

The communiqué accused the French government of trying to impose on Algeria a regulation that clearly violates the principle of self-determination. It stated that France's attempt to "reorganize the public power of Algeria" is a new and decisive step in betraying the principle of self-determination. It pointed out that doing so would only prolong the war.

The communiqué also accused France of intending to deprive Algeria of the Sahara, attempting to secretly implement the trick of "regional division" against the Algerian people. It also stated that this imposed regulation attempts to divide the Algerian people into artificial ethnic or religious groups.

The communiqué pointed out that this regulation is reminiscent of the now-bankrupt "Basic Law" implemented by the former French Minister Resident in Algeria, Lacoste. The communiqué said, "The Algerian people have become wise from past experience, and they will know how to make this bill suffer the same fate as the Basic Law."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 19th: "The Voice of the Republic of Algeria Radio" broadcast tonight, saying: "De Gaulle has only one path to take, that is, to reach an agreement with the Algerian government, recognize Algeria's freedom and unity, and obey the will of the Algerian people; otherwise, he will only suffer the (Vietnam) Dien Bien Phu ending in Algeria."

The radio station condemned de Gaulle's repeated tricks of so-called "ceasefire," "Algeria for the Algerians," and so-called "guarantees of self-determination," and pointed out that these hypocritical words of de Gaulle's are merely attempts to prevent France from falling into a desperate situation internationally.

The radio station then said that de Gaulle hopes for a "ceasefire" because France cannot afford the huge military expenditure and attempts to foster a "third force" in Algeria. However, de Gaulle's policy has completely failed.

The radio station pointed out that de Gaulle's "Algeria for the Algerians" plan is just a replica of the so-called French Algeria, which has been completely crushed by the Algerian revolution.

The radio station said that de Gaulle's attempt to divide Algeria on the basis of racial discrimination and apartheid will also end with the failure of French imperialism and de Gaulle's despair.

The radio station said that de Gaulle's decision on November 16 to hold a "referendum" in France tore off his last mask. The fate of Algeria can only be decided by the Algerian people.

    阿尔及利亚临时政府发表公报
    谴责戴高乐新的欺骗圈套
    法政府阴谋就建立“临时行政机构”法案在国内举行“公民投票”
    新华社19日讯　突尼斯消息：阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府新闻部18日发表公报，谴责戴高乐打算在“改组阿尔及利亚公共政权”的名义下在法国举行“公民投票”的新花招。
    在法国官方宣布，戴高乐最近打算提出一个法案，规定在阿尔及利亚行使他所谓的“自决权”之前建立一个“临时行政机构”，并且就这个法案在法国举行“公民投票”。
    公报指责法国政府正在设法强加于阿尔及利亚一个明白地违反自决原则的法规。它说，法国打算“改组阿尔及利亚的公共政权”的企图是背弃自决原则的一个新的决定性的步骤。它指出，这样作只会拖长战争。
    公报还指责法国打算使阿尔及利亚丧失撒哈拉，试图对阿尔及利亚人民偷偷实施“区域分治”的骗局，它还说，这个强加的法规想把阿尔及利亚人民分裂成人为的种族或宗教集团。
    公报指出，这项法规令人想起前法国在阿尔及利亚的驻节部长拉戈斯特所施行的现已破产的“基本法”。公报说，“阿尔及利亚人民从以前的经验中已经变得聪明了，他们将会知道如何使这个法案遭到跟基本法一样的命运。”
    新华社开罗19日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声电台”今晚广播说：“戴高乐只有一条路可走，那就是，同阿尔及利亚政府达成协议，承认阿尔及利亚的自由和统一，服从阿尔及利亚人民的意志，否则他只有在阿尔及利亚重遭（越南）奠边府的结局。”
    电台谴责戴高乐一再玩弄所谓“停火”、“阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚”和所谓“自决保证”的把戏，并指出戴高乐这些假仁假义的词句，只不过企图使法国在国际上免于陷入绝境。
    电台接着说，戴高乐希望“停火”，是因为法国没有能力负担庞大的军费，并且企图在阿尔及利亚扶植“第三种势力”。但是，戴高乐的这个政策已经完全失败了。
    电台指出，戴高乐的“阿尔及利亚人的阿尔及利亚”计划只是已被阿尔及利亚革命彻底粉碎了的所谓法属阿尔及利亚的翻版。
    电台说，戴高乐在种族歧视和种族隔离基础上来分裂阿尔及利亚的企图，也将以法帝国主义的失败和戴高乐的绝望而告终。
    电台说，戴高乐11月16日决定要在法国搞“公民投票”，这就撕破了他的最后的假面具。阿尔及利亚的命运只能由阿尔及利亚人民来决定。
