Xinhua News Agency, London, November 24th: British newspapers today widely commented on the failure of the United States' attempt to force West Germany to contribute money to alleviate its dollar crisis.

Some newspapers used headlines such as: "Germans Stun the United States," "A Big 'No,' Germans Refuse to Pay U.S. Expenses," "U.S. Delegation Leaves Bonn Empty-Handed."

The "Times" wrote in an editorial: "Since the end of the war, there has never been anything like the Bonn negotiations on defense spending. A powerful U.S. delegation made a trip in vain, apparently failing to reach an agreement with the West German government on any of the issues discussed."

Some newspapers took the opportunity to vent their resentment towards the United States' consistent favoritism towards West Germany. The "Daily Mail," with a sarcastic tone, said: "It is astonishing that the Germans, whom they (referring to the United States) have been boasting about as 'good students' to the rest of Europe, are also resisting." The "Daily Express" further stated: "These are distressing days for the Americans. Now they will understand that the Germans cannot be trusted."

Xinhua News Agency, London, November 23rd: London newspapers, commenting today on the deadlocked U.S.-Bonn financial talks, were clearly concerned that the United States would make more financial demands on Britain. They emphasized Britain's own difficulties and wanted West Germany to do more for the United States.

The "Daily Mail" published a signed article entitled "I Say Germany Can Afford It," and made a comparison of the economic positions of Britain and West Germany based on statistics. The newspaper said: West Germany, with a population similar to Britain, has gold and dollar reserves worth 2.5 billion pounds, twice as much as the reserves held by the City of London. As for spending, West Germany's "defense" budget for 1960 is slightly less than 1 billion pounds, while Britain's defense budget for this year is 1.629 billion pounds. The newspaper said, "Given the disasters the Germans have brought to the world, they are in a far better situation today than they deserve."

The "Times," reporting on the U.S.-Bonn talks, hoped that West Germany would meet all the financial assistance requirements put forward by the United States, so that "there would be no further demands for British assistance," and Anderson's trips to Paris and London were "solely to inform the French and British governments of the situation in the Bonn talks." Speaking of Britain's financial difficulties, the newspaper said: In 1959, Britain had only a surplus in its balance of payments, i.e., a surplus of 150 million pounds. Half of this amount—74 million pounds—came from payments to American personnel stationed in Britain. The newspaper added: As Eisenhower has decided to withdraw the families of American personnel stationed in Britain, the aforementioned amount will be reduced.

The "Daily Express" advocated withdrawing the British Royal Air Force fighters stationed in West Germany to show dissatisfaction with the United States and West Germany, while the American NATO commander Norstad was in London negotiating with British Defense Minister Watkinson precisely to request that they continue to be stationed in West Germany. The newspaper demanded that the government "firmly reject Norstad's request" and "transfer these fighters back home."

    两手空空离波恩  英报嘲笑安德逊
    新华社伦敦24日电　英国报纸今天广泛评论美国逼西德出钱来解救自己的美元危机的企图失败。
    一些报纸用了这样一些大字标题：“德国（西德）人使美国大吃一惊”，“一个大‘不’字，德国（西德）人拒绝支付美国的开支”，“美国代表团两手空空离开波恩。”
    “泰晤士报”在社论中写道：“自从大战结束以来，还不曾有过像关于防务开支的波恩谈判这样的事情。一个强有力的美国代表团居然空跑了一趟，显然未能就所讨论的任何问题同西德政府达成协议”。
    一些报纸乘机发泄对于美国一向偏袒西德的怨气。“每日邮报”以讽刺的口气说：“令人吃惊的是，他们（指美国）向欧洲其他地方炫耀为‘好学生’的德国（西德）人，也顽抗起来了”。“每日快报”进一步说：“对美国人来说，这是令人苦恼的日子。现在他们一定会懂得，德国（西德）人是不能信赖的”。
    新华社伦敦23日电　伦敦报纸今天在评论陷于僵局的美国—波恩财政会谈时，显然担心美国将向英国提出更多财政要求，它们强调英国本身的困难，并且要西德多为美国出点力。
    “每日邮报”以“我说德国（西德）出得起”为题刊载了一篇署名的文章，并且依据统计把英国和西德的经济地位作了一番比较。这家报纸说：人口同英国相仿的西德拥有值二十五亿英镑的黄金和美元储备，比伦敦城所拥有的储备多一倍。至于开支，西德1960年的“国防”预算是十亿英镑不到一点，而英国今年的国防预算为十六亿二千九百万英镑。这家报纸说，“鉴于德国人曾给世界带来的祸端，他们今天的境况远比他们应得的境况要好。”
    “泰晤士报”报道美国—波恩会谈的消息时希望西德将满足美国提出的财政援助的全部要求，这样，“就不会进一步要求英国援助”，而安德逊的巴黎和伦敦之行“仅仅是为了把在波恩会谈的情况告诉法英两国政府”。谈到英国的财政困难时，这家报纸说：1959年，英国在支付差额上只是有剩余，即：一亿五千万英镑的顺差。这个数额中有一半——七千四百万英镑——来自付给驻在英国的美国人员的款项。这家报纸又说：由于艾森豪威尔决定把驻在英国的美国人员的家属撤走，上述款项将要减少。
    “每日快报”主张撤回驻在西德的英国皇家空军战斗机以示对美国和西德的不满，而美国的北大西洋公约组织司令诺斯塔德恰恰为了要求它们继续留驻在西德而正在伦敦同英国国防大臣沃金森进行谈判。这家报纸要求政府“坚定地拒绝诺斯塔德的要求”，并“将这些战斗机调遣回国”。
