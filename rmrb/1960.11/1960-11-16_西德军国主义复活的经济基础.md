    The Economic Foundation of the Revival of West German Militarism
    Xí Línshēng
    Recently, the revanchist and militarist revival activities of the West German Adenauer government have become increasingly blatant and rampant. West German militarists openly demand atomic armament and prepare for atomic warfare. Government figures in West Germany have also repeatedly clamored to "recover the territories of old Germany" and are conducting territorial expansion in Western Europe. The full-fledged West German militarists, with the support of the United States, are following in the footsteps of the old path once taken by Hitler.
    
    Capital Concentration Exceeds Pre-War Levels
    It is not surprising that the history of the revival of German militarism is re-enacting itself in West Germany today, just as it did after the First World War. Because both the militarist policies pursued by Hitler and Adenauer are derived from the same "deepest economic foundation" of German imperialism—monopoly capitalism. Lenin once pointed out: "Modern militarism is the result of capitalism." He also said: "Imperialism, that is, monopoly capitalism, which was fully formed only in the twentieth century, is the least peace-loving and the least freedom-loving due to its fundamental economic characteristics, and develops militarism everywhere." Historically, German monopoly capital launched two world wars in order to re-divide the world by force. Although both ended in failure, German monopoly capitalism was never eradicated. It was restored and developed with the support of Western countries such as the United States and Britain. After the Second World War, a handful of former German monopoly capitalists have once again dominated the economy and politics of West Germany. It is this force of monopoly capitalism that is today actively supporting the Adenauer government's policy of foreign expansion and preparation for revenge wars.
    
    At present, the degree of capital concentration in West Germany is even more severe than in any previous period in German history. According to statistics, in 1938, joint-stock companies with share capital of less than 10 million West German marks accounted for 33% of the total share capital of joint-stock companies in Germany, but by 1958 this had fallen to 16.1%. The share held by companies with less than 50 million marks fell from 30% in 1938 to 21.4% in 1958. The share held by joint-stock companies with share capital of over 50 million to 100 million marks increased from 11.3% in 1938 to 16.5% in 1958. The most dramatic expansion of capital was in large companies with share capital of over 100 million marks, whose share increased from 25.8% in 1938 to 46% in 1958. At present, there are fifty-eight joint-stock companies in West Germany with share capital of 100 million or more, accounting for 2.3% of the total number of joint-stock companies in West Germany, but their share in the total capital of joint-stock companies in West Germany reached 48.6% in 1958.
    
    In fact, all large enterprises in West Germany today are manipulated by a handful of monopoly capitalists from seventeen large monopoly organizations. These monopoly capitalists are no strangers; they are the Farben, Thyssen, Krupp, Mannesmann, Flick, Siemens, and Deutsche Bank, etc., which have long dominated the economic lifeline of Germany. If we look at the situation of these large monopoly organizations controlling West German production, we can see the astonishing degree to which the development of monopoly capital in West Germany has reached today. In 1938, the steel production controlled by nine German metallurgical concerns accounted for 87.7%, but now it accounts for 93.9%. At present, just ten large concerns and joint-stock companies control 95% of the metallurgical industry, 100% of iron ore mining, and 87% of the coal industry. Five West German concerns control 89% of the entire automobile production; five concerns control 95% of West German oil production; and six concerns control 73.6% of West Germany's entire shipbuilding industry.
    
    In terms of financial capital, the assets of the three largest monopoly banks of the former German Empire: Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, and Commerzbank currently account for 60% of West Germany's total banking assets, which is far more than in the pre-war era. Today, the power of West Germany's three major banks occupies two thousand leadership positions in West German enterprises, and the most powerful concerns have their own representatives on the supervisory boards of these large banks. This shows that financial capital and industrial capital have closely combined and merged into one, forming the rule of a few financial oligarchs.
    
    All of this reflects the deep and acute degree to which the inherent contradiction between the social nature of production and the private ownership of the means of production in capitalist society has developed in West Germany today.
    
    The State Machine of Monopoly Capital
    The rule of monopoly capital inevitably leads to political reaction and decay. In fact, the entire state machine of West Germany today is completely in the hands of monopoly capitalists. In the current Bundestag, at least one hundred members are directly representing monopoly capital, bank capital, and wholesale trade. In the government, Chancellor Adenauer himself is a representative of German financial capital. He served as manager of Deutsche Bank for many years in the past, and now he has close ties with the three major banks. His family is also tied to the American Morgan consortium and West German monopoly capital. Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Economics Erhard comes from the economic alliance funded by the Farben concern and has close ties with the Ruhr metallurgical industry. Minister of Transport Seebohm has huge investments in the oil industry; Foreign Minister Brentano is a representative of the Röchling concern...
    
    This government, composed of representatives of monopoly capitalists, can only be an instrument for safeguarding the interests of the big bourgeoisie and suppressing and exploiting the oppressed classes. In recent years, the West German Adenauer government's banning of the German Communist Party and other progressive organizations, suppression of workers' strikes, increased economic burden on the people, trial and imprisonment of peaceful and democratic people, and the recent enactment of emergency laws to suppress strikes and movements opposing Adenauer's policies, etc., are all in accordance with the will of West German monopoly capital. On the other hand, the Adenauer government has made every effort to safeguard and serve the interests of monopoly capital. The West German government gives large monopoly enterprises billions of marks every year through tax reductions: it takes billions of marks from the budget every year to subsidize the export of goods and capital by monopoly capital in order to expand abroad. The Adenauer government also sells various profitable state-owned enterprises to big business owners at low prices and buys up bankrupt monopoly enterprises at high prices; it also gives monopoly enterprises tens of billions of marks in military orders every year. The West German Bundestag also continuously passes various laws that are beneficial to monopoly capital. In this way, Adenauer's regime opens the door wide for monopoly capital to seize high profits, while forcing the vast majority of the West German people to become increasingly impoverished under the cruel exploitation of capitalism.
    
    The rule of West German monopoly capital has further deepened the antagonistic contradiction between the working people and the bourgeoisie. The militarist policy pursued by the Adenauer government, in addition to its purpose of foreign expansion, is to use the violence of the state machine to suppress the people's resistance and consolidate the rule of monopoly capital.
    
    Foreign Expansion Intensifies
    While these old German monopoly capitalists have regained their strength, they are once again throwing their huge capital into the struggle of the imperialist camp to seize world markets, sources of raw materials, and spheres of influence.
    
    When carrying out this struggle, West German monopoly capital first started with commodity exports. Because the recovery and growth rate of West Germany's economic strength in recent years has greatly exceeded that of other capitalist countries, its commodity exports have the characteristics of being rapid and fierce. From 1950 to 1959, West German industrial production increased by nearly one and a half times, while export trade increased fourfold. Today, West Germany's position in the capitalist world trade market has jumped to third place after the United States and Britain. In terms of manufactured goods exports, West Germany has surpassed Britain. In the Western European market, West Germany has defeated the United States and Britain and taken the lead; in the Latin American market, West Germany has long surpassed Britain and ranks second; in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, West Germany is also gradually tightening its grip on Britain; West German monopoly capital has once again become a powerful competitor for capitalist countries such as Britain and France, and to a certain extent also the United States.
    
    While carrying out commodity exports, West German monopoly capital is also making every effort to intensify capital exports. This method of directly exploiting and plundering using capital has been placed on the agenda of West German monopoly capital with increasing urgency as the capitalist world economic crisis deepens and the struggle between imperialist countries to seize markets intensifies. At present, West Germany's capital exports (including private and government) have reached 27 billion marks. Direct foreign investment accounts for 4.5 billion marks, of which private direct investment amounts to more than 2.4 billion marks. These investments are all over the world, especially in underdeveloped countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    
    The establishment of the "European Common Market" of the six Western European countries marks the beginning of West German monopoly capital's participation in the struggle to divide the capitalist world market and spheres of influence. As is well known, the "Common Market" is an international monopoly organization in which West German monopoly capital, with the support of the United States, unites some countries and excludes others in order to turn the European continent and its associated African territories into its exclusive commodity sales market and investment place. This is actually a revival of the past German imperialist's arrogant demands to seize spheres of influence and re-divide the world. A confidant of West German Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Economics Erhard once said: "The most developed countries must have their own privileged areas, which are like their rear: for the United States, it is the American continent, for Britain—the Commonwealth countries, for West Germany—Europe and its indigenous extension in Africa."
    
    In its foreign economic expansion, West German monopoly capital strives to hang the signs of "aid" and "cooperation," saying that it is "enthusiastically helping" the economic development of other countries. This is purely a lie. Erhard made it clear not long ago that West Germany's foreign investment should "go to those countries with sufficient labor," and "can and should use them." The West German big bourgeois newspaper "Die Welt" also said: "The decisive factor for West German investment is profitability." This shows that West Germany, like other imperialist countries, regards the labor force and resources of the countries it invests in as objects for its plunder and enslavement. In fact, West Germany's commodity exports and capital exports to underdeveloped countries most clearly expose its imperialist plundering essence. In mutual trade, West Germany strives to maintain underdeveloped countries as a raw material supply base and a sales market for West German manufactured goods. At the same time, through this unequal trade, West Germany has maintained a huge surplus in trade with these countries for a long time, and underdeveloped countries have become West Germany's debtor countries, and have to rely on West Germany economically. Then, West German monopoly capital takes advantage of these countries' economic difficulties to propose "financial aid," loans, and investments with various enslaving conditions, etc., in order to use all of this to allow West German commodities to enter these countries in a steady stream and allow West German capital to further control the economic lifeline of these countries. Although this method is different from the naked military plunder and enslavement of German imperialism in the past. This is because the times are different today, the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and the people of colonial and dependent countries have become increasingly awakened, and the imperialist colonial rule is collapsing. Under this situation, the old colonialist means of aggression can no longer subdue the colonial people. Therefore, West Germany uses economic infiltration and economic aggression, replacing the rusty handcuffs of past military subjugation with a gilded chain. The West German monopoly capital mouthpiece "The Economist" magazine once admitted: "The national liberation movement ended the colonial era and created completely new political conditions for development work," so "new ways and new methods must be found to export capital to developing countries." West Germany's "Industriekurier" also said: "In these countries, whoever has the economic advantage will also have the political advantage." Therefore, what West German monopoly capital is using today is a more cunning and insidious means of neo-colonialist aggression. This method still has a certain deceptive effect at present, but in any case, the essence of this new method is the imperialist plunder and enslavement of underdeveloped countries, so this deceptive effect cannot last. The development of things will inevitably move towards its opposite, and the imperialist plunder will eventually lead to a surge in the anti-plunder struggle of the people of underdeveloped countries. Therefore, West German monopoly capital's neo-colonialist expansion does not exclude the use of military means to consolidate its colonial interests once this expansion is defeated. In fact, West German monopoly capital is doing just that today: its support for France's colonial war against Algeria in terms of manpower and financial resources is one example. And the current West German efforts to seek military hegemony all contain the intention to plunder and subjugate colonies by force.
    
    Therefore, the expansion of West German monopoly capital will greatly deepen its contradictions with the people of underdeveloped countries, and will also make the contradictions between imperialist countries increasingly acute, making their struggle for markets and raw material bases more and more of a life-and-death nature.
    
    Collusion between US and German Capital
    The rapid recovery and development of West German monopoly capital after the war is the result of the support and assistance of US imperialism. After the Second World War, the United States used its advantageous political conditions as a victor to make every effort to infiltrate its economic power into West Germany and strengthen the control of US monopoly capital over West Germany. On the other hand, the United States also supports West German monopoly capital, supports West German monopoly capital's foreign expansion, and colludes with West German monopoly capital to share profits and squeeze out the forces of old British and French colonialist countries around the world, seizing colonies and spheres of influence from these countries. Former US Secretary of State Dulles believed as early as ten years ago that "a revived Germany" could also be a "great asset" for the United States. It was with this purpose in mind that the United States has invested a large amount of loans and private capital in West German monopoly capital since the war. According to statistics, loans under the "Marshall Plan" alone have reached 14.7 billion marks. At present, US private capital is estimated to be at least 2.3 billion marks. US private investment has taken control of more than 400 joint-stock companies in West Germany, most of which are industries related to military production, such as electronics, automobiles, petroleum, and aircraft. In addition, many US concerns have also concluded many international agreements with West German concerns in terms of dividing markets, "cooperation" on loans, and exchanging technical information. It is this imperialist economic interest that determines that the US authorities once again pull German imperialism out of the mire of defeat.
    
    West German monopoly capital is willing to form this relationship of collusion and utilization with the United States. Because West German monopoly capital knows that only by relying on the help of the United States and colluding with the United States can it be possible to restore its past power, re-conduct foreign plunder and revenge wars, and seize its own spheres of influence from the old British and French colonialist countries. Due to the strengthening of US economic infiltration, the forces of the pro-American faction represented by Adenauer, which colludes with US capital, have been able to firmly grasp the rule of West Germany. This makes West Germany more dependent on the United States and implements the US aggressive policy than any German imperialist in history. However, any imperialist collusion is a robber alliance as Lenin pointed out. Today, West Germany's dependence on the United States is not what West German monopoly capital is willing to do. When West German monopoly capital is gradually becoming full-fledged, it will make every effort to get rid of the United States and embark on the road of independent development. At present, the contradictions between West Germany and the United States are developing in the struggle for the world market, especially the Latin American market. Within West German monopoly capital, these forces tending towards independence disagree with Adenauer from time to time on the issue of methods of foreign expansion. This relationship of collusion and contradiction is a characteristic of the alliance between West German monopoly capital and US monopoly capital. However, because West German monopoly capital still needs US help and support in various aspects at present, and the forces of the pro-American faction still occupy the upper hand, the collusion between these two imperialist countries is still the main aspect.
    
    In summary, it can be seen that the West German Adenauer government, with the support of the United States, is actively reviving German militarism in line with the aggressive interests of German monopoly capital. West German monopoly capital regards the reconstruction of a strong military force as a means to support its further foreign expansion and plunder, and it is this imperialist policy that makes West Germany once again become a dangerous source of war. Of course, the times are different today, the strength of the socialist camp has greatly increased, and the imperialist forces have been greatly weakened, which makes the possibility of preventing imperialist launching aggressive wars much greater today than in the past. But it must also be seen that as long as imperialism exists, there is also the soil for aggressive wars to occur. The aggressive nature of imperialism will never change until it dies. Just look at German imperialism as proof. This imperialism has suffered serious defeats in two world wars, and its sphere of rule has been greatly reduced today. But despite this, German imperialism is unwilling to accept the lessons of history at all. It makes every effort to stand up again from its defeat and continues to carry out aggression, prepare for revenge wars, and follow the old path of Hitler. Facts prove that imperialism will never voluntarily lay down its butcher knife. To make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again until its demise, this is indeed the logic of imperialism. And the closer it gets to death, the more frantically it struggles. Therefore, people must not relax their vigilance against the imperialist conspiracy to prepare for war, and must resolutely expose and fight against it.

    西德军国主义复活的经济基础
    席林生
    近来，西德阿登纳政府的复仇主义和复活军国主义的活动越来越嚣张而猖狂了。西德军国主义者公开要求原子武装，准备原子战争。西德政府的当权人物也一再公然叫嚣要“收复过去的德国的领土”，并且在西欧进行领土扩张。羽毛丰满的西德军国主义者在美国的支持下，正在亦步亦趋地走着过去希特勒所走过的老路。
    资本集中　超过战前
    今天在西德又像第一次世界大战之后一样，重演着德国军国主义复活的历史是一点也不奇怪的。因为无论是希特勒和阿登纳所执行的军国主义政策，都是导源于同一个德国帝国主义的“最深的经济基础”——垄断资本主义。列宁曾经指出过：“现代军国主义是资本主义的结果”。他还说：“帝国主义，即在二十世纪才完全形成的垄断资本主义，由于它的根本的经济特点，则最不爱和平，最不爱自由，到处发展军国主义”。在历史上德国垄断资本为了以武力重新分割世界，曾经两次发动世界大战。虽然最后都失败了，但是德国的垄断资本主义却一直没有被根除，它在美英等西方国家的扶植下重又复原和发展起来。在第二次大战后，一小撮过去的德国垄断资本已经重新统治着西德的经济和政治。正是这种垄断资本主义的势力今天又在积极支持阿登纳政府的对外扩张和准备复仇战争的侵略政策。
    目前西德资本集中的程度已经比过去德国历史上的任何时期更厉害。据材料统计，在1938年，德国拥有股本一千万西德马克以下的股份公司占股份公司股份资本总额的33％，而到1958年更下降为16.1％。拥有五千万马克以下的公司所占份额则由1938年的30％，下降为1958年的21.4％。而拥有股本五千万以上到一亿马克的股份公司所占份额从1938年的11.3％上升为1958年的16.5％。资本扩张最为猛烈的是拥有股本一亿马克以上的大公司，它们所占份额由1938年的25.8％增长到1958年的46％。目前在西德拥有股本一亿和一亿以上的股份公司有五十八个，占西德全部股份公司总数的2.3％，但是它们在西德股份公司总资本额中所占份额在1958年达到48.6％。
    实际上西德今天所有大企业是操纵在十七个大垄断组织的一小撮垄断资本的手里。而对于这些垄断资本，人们是并不陌生的，它们就是历史上长时期统治德国经济命脉的法本、蒂森、克虏伯、曼索斯曼、弗利克、西门子等康采恩以及德意志银行等等。如果我们看一下这些大垄断组织控制西德生产品的情形，更可以看出今天西德垄断资本的发展已达到了怎样惊人的地步。1938年时九个德国冶金康采恩所控制的钢生产占87.7％，而现在已经占93.9％。目前，仅仅十家大康采恩和股份公司操纵着95％的冶金工业，100％的铁矿开采和87％的煤炭工业。西德五家康采恩控制了整个汽车生产的89％；五家康采恩控制了西德石油产量的95％；六家康采恩控制了西德整个造船工业的73.6％。
    在金融资本方面，前德意志帝国的三家最大垄断银行：德意志银行、德累斯顿银行和商业银行目前拥有的资产占了西德全部银行资产的60％，已大大超过战前的年代。今天西德三大银行的势力在西德企业中占据着二千个领导职位，而最强大的康采恩在这些大银行的监察委员会里有自己的代表。这说明金融资本和工业资本已经密切结合、融为一体，形成了少数财政寡头的统治。
    这一切反映出今天西德生产社会性与私人占有制这个资本主义社会所固有的矛盾已经发展到了多么深刻而尖锐的程度。
    垄断资本的国家机器
    垄断资本的统治必然引起政治上的反动和腐朽。事实上今天西德的整个国家机器也完全掌握在垄断资本家的手中。在本届联邦议院中，至少有一百名议员是直接代表垄断资本、银行资本和批发商业的。而在政府中，总理阿登纳本人就是德国金融资本的代表人物。他过去曾担任德意志银行经理多年，现在他同三大银行有极密切的关系。他的家族也同美国摩根财团和西德垄断资本结成裙带关系。副总理兼经济部长艾哈德来自法本康采恩资助的经济联盟，同鲁尔冶金工业有密切联系。交通部长塞博姆在石油工业中有巨额投资；外交部长勃伦塔诺是雷希林康采恩的代表……。
    这种由垄断资本家代表组成的政府只能是维护大资产阶级利益和镇压并剥削被压迫阶级的工具。几年来西德阿登纳政府取缔德国共产党和其他进步组织、压制工人罢工、加重人民经济负担、审判和监禁和平民主人士以及最近制定镇压罢工和反对阿登纳政策运动的紧急状态法等等就是奉行西德垄断资本的意旨。而另一方面对于垄断资本的利益，阿登纳政府却是百般尽力维护和效劳。西德政府通过减低税率年年向大垄断企业奉送数十亿马克的礼：每年从预算中拿出好几十亿马克来资助垄断资本输出商品和资本，以便向外扩张。阿登纳政府还把各种赚钱的国营企业以低价出卖给大企业主，而以高价收买即将破产的垄断的企业；它还给垄断企业每年几十亿马克的军事订货。西德的联邦议院也不断通过各种有利于垄断资本的法案。阿登纳的政权就是这样替垄断资本大开攫取高额利润之门，而迫使西德广大人民在资本主义的残酷剥削下越来越贫困。
    西德垄断资本的统治进一步加深了劳动人民和资产阶级之间的对抗性矛盾。阿登纳政府推行的军国主义政策，除了它的对外扩张的目的之外，对内就是以国家机器的暴力来镇压人民的反抗、巩固垄断资本的统治。
    对外扩张　变本加厉
    这些旧日的德国垄断资本在重新恢复了它们的实力的同时，挟其雄厚的资本，再次投入帝国主义阵营争夺世界市场、原料产地和势力范围的斗争。
    西德垄断资本在进行这场斗争时首先是从商品输出开始。由于几年来西德经济实力的恢复和增长速度大大超过其他资本主义国家，因此它的商品输出就带有急剧而凶猛的特点。从1950年到1959年，西德工业生产增长了近一倍半，而出口贸易却增长了四倍。今天西德在资本主义世界贸易市场上的地位跃居到美、英之后的第三位。而在制成品出口方面西德更超过了英国。在西欧市场上西德已打败美英而独占鳌头；在拉丁美洲市场上西德也早已超过英国而名列第二；在中东和东南亚西德也在步步逼紧英国；西德垄断资本又一次成为英、法等资本主义国家、在一定程度上也是美国的一个强有力的竞争对手。
    西德垄断资本在进行商品输出的同时，也竭力加紧资本输出。这种利用资本直接进行剥削和掠夺的办法，随着资本主义世界经济危机的加深和帝国主义国家争夺市场斗争的尖锐化而越来越紧迫地提上了西德垄断资本的议事日程。目前西德的资本输出（包括私人和政府的）达到二百七十亿马克。国外直接投资占了四十五亿马克，其中私人直接投资达二十四亿多马克。这些投资遍及世界各地、特别是亚、非、拉丁美洲等不发达国家。
    西欧六国的“欧洲共同市场”的成立，标志着西德垄断资本已开始参与瓜分资本主义世界市场和势力范围的斗争。如所周知，“共同市场”是西德垄断资本在美国的支持下，联合一些国家，排挤另一些国家，以便把西欧大陆和与之联系的非洲属地变成它独占的商品销售市场和投资场所的国际垄断组织。这实际上是过去德国帝国主义争夺势力范围和重新分割世界的狂妄要求的复活。西德副总理兼经济部长艾哈德的一个亲信就曾说过：“最发达的国家必须有自己的特权地区，这种地区就像它们的后方：对美国来说就是美洲大陆、英国——英联邦国家、西德——欧洲及其在非洲的本土延长部分。”
    西德垄断资本在对外经济扩张中，竭力挂上“援助”、“合作”的牌子，说什么是“热心帮助”别国经济发展。这纯然是谎话。艾哈德不久前曾明白表示，西德的对外投资应当“走向那些有足够劳动力的国家”，“可以并且应该利用他们。”西德大资产阶级报纸“世界报”也曾说：“西德投资的决定性因素是有利可图”。这说明西德像其他帝国主义国家一样，是把它所投资的国家的劳动力和资源当作它进行掠夺和奴役的对象的。事实上西德对不发达国家的商品输出和资本输出最明显不过地暴露出它的帝国主义的掠夺的本质。在相互贸易中，西德竭力把不发达国家维持为一个原料供应基地和西德制成品的销售市场。同时通过这种不平等交易使西德对这些国家的贸易长期来保持着巨大的顺差，不发达国家则成了西德的债务国，不得不在经济上依赖于西德。于是西德垄断资本乘着这些国家经济困难之机提出附有各种奴役性条件的“财政援助”、贷款及投资等等，以便利用这一切使西德商品源源进入这些国家、让西德资本进一步控制这些国家的经济命脉。虽然这种方式同过去德国帝国主义赤裸裸的武力掠夺和奴役有所不同。这是因为今天时代已经不同，东风已经压倒西风，殖民地附属国人民已经日益觉醒，帝国主义的殖民统治正在崩溃。在这种形势下，老的殖民主义的侵略手段已经不能镇服殖民地人民了。因此西德就借助于经济渗入和经济侵略的办法，把过去军事镇服的锈烂了的手铐换成一条镀金的锁链。西德垄断资本喉舌“经济学家”周刊曾经承认：“民族解放运动结束了殖民主义时代，为开发工作造成了完全新的政治条件”，因此“必须寻找新的途径和新的方式来向正在发展中的国家输出资本”。西德的“工业快邮报”也曾说：“在这些国家中谁在经济方面占优势，那末它在政治方面也将占优势。”因此西德垄断资本今天所用的是更加狡猾而阴险的新殖民主义的侵略手段。这种手段在目前还有一定的欺骗的作用，但是无论如何这种新的手法的本质是帝国主义对不发达国家的掠夺和奴役，因此这种欺骗作用不可能持久的。事物的发展必将走向它的反面，帝国主义的掠夺终将引起不发达国家人民反掠夺斗争的高涨。所以西德垄断资本新殖民主义扩张也并不排斥在一旦这种扩张遭到失败后而利用军事手段来巩固它的殖民利益。事实上今天西德垄断资本也正是在这样做：它在人力财力上支援法国对阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争就是一例。而目前西德要求军事霸权的努力，也都是包含着武力掠夺和镇服殖民地的企图。
    因此，西德垄断资本的扩张将大大加深它同不发达国家人民之间的矛盾，并且在目前也使帝国主义国家之间的矛盾越来越尖锐化，使它们之间争夺市场和原料基地的斗争更加具有你死我活的性质。
    美德资本互相勾结
    西德垄断资本在战后的迅速恢复和发展，是美帝国主义扶植和帮助的结果。第二次世界大战之后，美国利用战胜国这一有利的政治条件竭力把美国的经济势力渗入西德，加强美国垄断资本对西德的控制。而另一方面美国又扶植西德垄断资本，支持西德垄断资本对外扩张，并且与西德垄断资本勾结一起分享利润和在世界各地排挤英、法老牌殖民主义国家势力，从这些国家手里夺取殖民地和势力范围。前美国国务卿杜勒斯曾在十年以前就认为“一个复兴的德国”也可能是美国的“一笔很大的资产”。正是怀着这种目的，美国在战后以来对西德垄断资本投下了大量的贷款和私人资本。据统计仅仅在“马歇尔计划”下的贷款已达一百四十七亿马克之巨。而目前美国的私人资本从低估计也有二十三亿马克。美国的私人投资已掌握了西德四百多家股份公司，这些公司绝大多数是同军备生产有关的电子、汽车、石油、飞机等工业。此外，美国的许多康采恩也已经同西德的康采恩在分割市场、贷款“合作”以及交换技术情报等方面缔结了许多国际协定。正是这种帝国主义的经济利益决定美国当权者再一次把德国帝国主义从失败的泥坑中拉出来。
    西德垄断资本是愿意同美国结成这种又勾结又利用的关系的。因为西德垄断资本知道，今天只有依靠美国的帮助和同美国勾结一起，才有可能重新恢复过去的势力，重新进行对外掠夺和复仇战争，并且从英法老牌殖民主义国家手中夺取自己的势力范围。由于美国经济渗入的加强，从而使以阿登纳为代表的、与美国资本勾结的亲美派的势力得以紧紧地掌握着西德的统治。这就使得目前西德比历史上任何时候的德国帝国主义者都更加依附于美国，执行着美国的侵略政策。但是任何帝国主义的勾结正像列宁指出的是一种强盗的联盟。今天西德依附美国并不是西德垄断资本所心甘情愿的。当西德垄断资本在羽毛渐丰之后，它就会竭力摆脱美国而走上独立发展的道路。目前在争夺世界市场，特别是拉丁美洲市场上，西德与美国的矛盾正在发展。在西德垄断资本内部，这种趋向独立的势力同阿登纳在对外扩张的方法问题上不时发生分歧。这种又勾结又矛盾的关系正是西德垄断资本和美国垄断资本结盟的一个特点。不过由于目前西德垄断资本在各方面还需要美国的帮助和支持，同时亲美派的势力还占着上峰，因此这两个帝国主义国家的勾结还是主要的方面。
    综上所述可以看出，西德阿登纳政府在美国支持下，积极复活德国军国主义是符合德国垄断资本的侵略利益的。西德垄断资本把重建强大的军事力量看作支持它进一步向外扩张和掠夺的手段，而正是这种帝国主义政策使西德重新成为一个危险的战争的策源地。当然今天时代已经不同，社会主义阵营的力量大大增强，帝国主义势力大大削弱，这使制止帝国主义发动侵略战争的可能性今天比过去大得多了。但是也不能不看到，只要帝国主义存在，也就存在着发生侵略战争的土壤。帝国主义的侵略本性是至死不会改变的。只要看一下德国帝国主义就是一个证明。这个帝国主义在两次大战中都曾遭到了严重的失败，而今天它的统治范围也已经大为缩小。但是尽管这样，德国帝国主义却一点也不愿意接受历史的教训。它竭力从失败中重新站起来，并且继续进行侵略，准备复仇战争，走希特勒的老路。事实证明，帝国主义是绝不会自动放下屠刀的。捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败直至灭亡，这的确是帝国主义的逻辑。而且越是临近死亡，越要疯狂挣扎。因此人们对于帝国主义准备战争的阴谋决不能放松警惕，必须给予坚决的揭露和斗争。
