Xinhua News Agency, November 12th, Leopoldville Dispatch: Due to the intensified efforts of U.S. imperialism to swallow up the Congo and the conspiracy of the imperialist-backed Congolese traitorous groups to undermine Congolese independence and unity, the Congolese political situation remains chaotic. The Congolese people are waging an unyielding struggle to defend the country's independence and unity, and to resist imperialism and its running dogs.

    In Leopoldville, the Congolese capital, the reactionary army of the Mobutu rebel group continues to close the parliament, arrest patriots, and surround the residence of Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba, further restricting his freedom of movement. The "Committee of Commissioners" appointed by the rebel leader Mobutu to "take over power" occupies the Congolese government building and controls radio and newspapers.

    Meanwhile, in Katanga Province in southern Congo, the Tshombe traitorous group, which serves the colonial interests of the Katanga Union Mining Company, continues to carry out secessionist activities wildly under the planning of a large number of Belgian "advisers." They have armed more reactionary troops, and on November 2nd, they announced the establishment of a so-called "Five-Member Restricted Cabinet" headed by Tshombe. This group has also sent a "delegation" to Western Europe and New York to seek "international support."

    In Kasai Province, the Kalonji separatist group, which was spared from being crushed by the Congolese government forces only due to the open protection of the UN authorities and the Mobutu rebellion, launched an offensive on October 28th, led by Belgian officers, in the southern region of Kasai Province, massacring the people in an attempt to expand its territory.

    With the support and mediation of imperialism, these traitorous groups in the Congo are intensifying their collusion and acting in cahoots.

    The chaotic situation in the Congo is entirely created by U.S., Belgian, and other imperialists in order to plunder the Congo's resources and undermine its independence. The United States is manipulating the "UN forces" to carry out particularly insidious activities. Prime Minister Lumumba revealed as early as October 9th that "today it has been proven that certain UN officials directly provide large sums of money to people who are hostile to the (Congolese) government, and personnel from the UN forces headquarters even go directly into the (Congolese army) barracks to distribute money to the soldiers." He pointed out bluntly, "The money for this bribery comes from the United States." He also condemned U.S. imperialism in a speech for plotting to overthrow the legitimate government of the Congo in order to seize the Congo's uranium.

    The United States is stepping up its opposition to the Lumumba government. Associated Press reporter Haytohar said, "The prevailing opinion in the United States now is that restoring (Congolese) administrative order will definitely mean restoring Lumumba's position as prime minister," which the United States opposes. At the same time, according to Haytohar, U.S. officials are "now inclined to favor a strong administrative head in the Congo." That is to say, to support a puppet with dictatorial powers to serve the U.S. policy of enslaving and plundering the Congo.

    The "UN forces" manipulated by the United States are constantly expanding the scope of their military occupation. It protects traitorous groups and interferes with the struggle of the Congolese patriotic people. When the Congolese government punitive forces were marching victoriously towards the Kalonji group and the Tshombe group, the "UN authorities" planned a so-called "ceasefire" and established a so-called "neutral zone" between Katanga Province and Kivu Province to prevent the advancing punitive forces. On the other hand, in the situation where the people of Katanga Province have launched patriotic struggles, the "UN forces" have declared the northern region of Katanga Province, where the struggle is booming, as a UN "defense zone," and directly suppress the people. The "UN authorities" have also stated that they want to establish similar so-called "neutral zones" controlled by the "UN forces" in southern Kasai Province.

    Taking advantage of the current situation, U.S. monopoly capital is seizing the opportunity to infiltrate the Congo on a large scale. The U.S. Rockefeller Consortium has increased its investment in the "Katanga Union Mining Company" (which controls most of the Congolese economy). In addition, news reports that this consortium recently controlled 55% of the shares in a newly established U.S.-Belgian mining company in the Congo. Representatives of U.S. monopoly capital have flocked to the Congo for activities.

    The Belgian colonialists who were driven out by the Congolese people have recently returned in droves. According to a report submitted by the UN representative to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, the number of Belgian colonialists in Leopoldville alone has increased from 4,500 at the end of July this year to the current 6,500, and continues to increase.

    However, the conflict of interests in the looting of the Congo among the U.S., Belgian, and other imperialists who collude to invade the Congo is also developing. The ambitious U.S. imperialists expressed serious concern about the large number of Belgian colonialists returning to the Congo, while the Belgian colonialists are deeply wary of the U.S. conspiracy to swallow up the Congo through the United Nations. They exposed their ugly faces in mutual recriminations.

    The Mobutu group, which was once supported by the United States and is now increasingly influenced by Belgium, recently openly accused the UN manipulated by the United States of "systematically preventing the return of Belgian experts" to facilitate the intervention of U.S. and British capital and technical personnel in the Congo. On the other hand, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, who is running errands for the United States, accused the large influx of Belgian colonialists into the Congo in a "Congolese situation" report submitted to the United Nations on November 3, "re-infiltrating some key aspects of the country's public life," and clamored to strengthen the "UN forces" in order to exert pressure on the Belgian colonialists. The U.S. State Department stated in a statement that it required Belgium to "cooperate" with the United Nations. The U.S. "New York Herald Tribune" openly demanded that "UN personnel replace Belgian colonialists."

    The Congolese people have further recognized the true face of imperialism, and they have risen up to fight for the defense of the independence and unity of their motherland. In the capital Leopoldville, residents held demonstrations against the Mobutu rebel group and expressed support for Prime Minister Lumumba. Some Congolese youths, unafraid of brutal suppression, beat up the "commissioners" appointed by the Mobutu group.

    In Stanleyville, the capital of Orientale Province, the Congolese garrison and the people swore allegiance to the Lumumba government, arrested officers sent there by Mobutu to carry out conspiracies, and crushed the conspiracy of U.S. and Belgian imperialism to create a separatist "state" there.

    The Baluba people in Katanga Province launched an armed struggle against the Tshombe traitorous group in one-third of the province.

    Under the increasingly strong opposition of the people, the position of traitors like Mobutu is constantly weakening, and more and more people in Mobutu's army are disobeying his orders. The Associated Press admitted that "the position of the pro-Western Mobutu, who is struggling desperately to maintain control, is becoming increasingly unstable." It said worriedly that if the United States continues to support Mobutu, "it will find that it is supporting a loser."

    This newspaper reports that the governor of Leopoldville Province, Kamitatu, was released on the 13th after being unreasonably detained by the Mobutu group for three days. According to Reuters, Kamitatu drove through the streets of Leopoldville with police escorts after his release. However, his current whereabouts remain unknown. The news also said that Kamitatu and Mobutu had reached an "agreement on resolving the differences between them."

    在美帝国主义干涉和“联合国军”占领下
    刚果政局混乱群魔乱舞
    在人民强烈反对下蒙博托等叛国分子地位不断削弱
    新华社12日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：由于美帝国主义加紧鲸吞刚果和帝国主义支持的刚果叛国集团破坏刚果独立和统一的阴谋活动，刚果政局目前仍然处于混乱状态。刚果人民正在为维护国家的独立和统一，坚持对帝国主义及其走狗进行着不屈的斗争。
    在刚果首都利奥波德维尔，蒙博托叛乱集团的反动军队仍封闭着议会，逮捕爱国者，并且包围刚果总理卢蒙巴的住宅，进一步限制他的行动自由。叛乱头子蒙博托任命来“接管权力”的“专员委员会”占据着刚果政府大厦并控制着电台和报刊。
    同时，在刚果南部的加丹加省，为加丹加联合矿业公司殖民利益服务的冲伯卖国集团在大量比利时籍
  “顾问”的策划下，继续猖狂地进行分裂活动。他们武装了更多的反动军队，11月2日又宣布成立了以冲伯为首的所谓“五人限制内阁”。这个集团还派了“代表团”去西欧和纽约活动，寻求“国际支持”。
    在开赛省，由于联合国当局的公开庇护和蒙博托的叛乱才免于被刚果政府军粉碎的卡隆吉分裂集团10月28日，竟出动军队，在比利时军官指挥下，在开赛省南部地区发动进攻，残杀人民，企图扩大它的地盘。
    在帝国主义的支持和撮合下，刚果这些叛国集团正加紧勾结，狼狈为奸。
    刚果的混乱局势是美国、比利时等帝国主义为了掠夺刚果富源和破坏刚果独立一手造成的。美国操纵“联合国军”进行着特别阴险的勾当。卢蒙巴总理在10月9日就已经揭露说，“今天业已证明，联合国的某些官员直接把大量金钱供给敌视（刚果）政府的人们，联合国军司令部人员甚至跑到（刚果陆军）军营内部直接向士兵散发金钱”。他曾经直截了当地指出，“为这种贿赂出钱的是美国”。他还在一次讲话中谴责美帝国主义为了霸占刚果的铀而策划推翻刚果合法政府。
    美国正在加紧反对卢蒙巴政府。美联社记者海托华说，“美国现在占优势的意见认为，目前恢复
  （刚果）行政秩序将会肯定地意味着恢复卢蒙巴的总理职务”，而这是美国所反对的。同时，据海托华说，美国官员们“现在倾向于赞成在刚果有一个强有力的行政首脑”。也就是说，扶植一个握有独裁权力的傀儡，来为美国奴役和掠夺刚果的政策效劳。
    美国操纵的“联合国军”正在不断扩大它的军事占领范围。它庇护叛国集团，干涉刚果爱国人民的斗争。当刚果政府讨伐军向卡隆吉集团和冲伯集团胜利进军的时候，
  “联合国当局”策划了所谓“停火”，并在加丹加省和基伍省之间建立所谓“中立区”，来阻止讨伐军队前进。另一方面，在加丹加省人民群起进行爱国斗争的形势下，“联合国军”把斗争蓬勃开展的加丹加省北部地区，宣布为联合国的“防御区”，由“联合国军”直接来镇压人民。“联合国当局”还表示要在开赛省南部建立同类的由“联合国军”控制的所谓“中立区”。
    利用目前的局势，美国垄断资本乘机大举渗入刚果。美国的洛克菲勒财团已经增加了它在“加丹加联合矿业公司”（它控制着刚果大部分经济）中的投资。另外有消息说，这个财团最近在刚果新成立的一个美比矿业公司中又控制了55％的股票。美国垄断资本的代表纷纷前往刚果活动。
    被刚果人民赶走的比利时殖民者最近纷纷卷土重来。据联合国代表向联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德提出的报告透露，仅利奥波德维尔一地，比利时殖民者的人数已由今年7月底的四千五百人增加到目前的六千五百人，并在继续增加。
    但是，互相勾结起来侵略刚果的美、比等帝国主义在抢夺刚果的强盗行为中的利益冲突也在发展。野心勃勃的美帝国主义者对大批比利时殖民者重返刚果表示严重不安，而比利时殖民者对美国利用联合国企图鲸吞刚果的阴谋深具戒心。它们在互相攻讦中暴露了自己的鬼脸。
    美国曾加支持而现在受比利时影响愈来愈大的蒙博托集团最近公开指责美国操纵的联合国“有计划地防止比利时专家的回来”，而便利美国和英国资本和技术人员插足刚果。另一方面，为美国奔走的联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德11月3日在向联合国提出的一份掩饰美国侵略刚果的“刚果局势”报告中，指责比利时殖民者大批涌入刚果重新“渗入了这个国家的公共生活的一些关键方面”，并叫嚷要加强
  “联合国部队”以便对比利时殖民者施加压力。美国国务院在声明中表示要求比利时同联合国“进行合作”。美国“纽约先驱论坛报”公开要“联合国人员代替比利时殖民者”。
    刚果人民已经进一步认清了帝国主义的真面目，他们纷纷起来为保卫祖国的独立和统一而斗争。在首都利奥波德维尔，居民们举行了示威游行，反对蒙博托叛乱集团，并表示支持卢蒙巴总理，一些刚果青年不畏残酷镇压，痛打蒙博托集团任命的“专员”。
    在东方省省会斯坦利维尔，刚果驻军和人民宣誓忠于卢蒙巴政府，并且逮捕了蒙博托派往那里进行阴谋活动的军官和粉碎了美比帝国主义企图在那里制造分裂“国家”的阴谋。
    加丹加省的巴卢巴族人在该省三分之一的地区内展开了反对冲伯卖国集团的武装斗争。
    在人民愈来愈强烈的反对下，蒙博托等叛国分子的地位在不断削弱，蒙博托的军队中愈来愈多的人不听他的使唤。美联社承认，“拚命挣扎以便维持控制的亲西方的蒙博托的地位愈来愈不稳了”。并忧心忡忡地说，如果美国仍旧支持蒙博托，“它就会发现它是在支持一个失败者”。
    本报讯　刚果利奥波德维尔省省长卡米塔图在被蒙博托集团无理拘留三天以后，已于13日获释。据路透社报道，卡米塔图获释后曾在警察陪同下驱车经过利奥波德维尔的街道。但是目前的去处仍然不明。消息还说，卡米塔图同蒙博托已就
  “解决他们之间的分歧问题达成了协议”。
