    Shared Purpose

    Recently, the CCP Xinyang Prefectural Committee requested all cadres sent to lower levels to not only "four togethers" with the masses, but also to focus on sharing a common purpose. This is very important.

    In fact, our vast number of cadres and youth are doing just that. Currently, a large number of cadres, workers, and youth are going to the countryside to support the front line of agricultural production, which is a manifestation of this spirit of shared purpose. They have truly achieved eating together, living together, working together, and discussing matters together with the masses. They have made considerable achievements in changing the face of poverty, transforming low yields into high yields, and transforming backwardness into advancement. Why can they do this? The fundamental reason is that they share a common purpose with the masses, regarding the joy of the masses as their own joy, regarding the pain of the masses as their own pain, and working together with the masses, with one heart and one mind, diligently and thriftily, struggling arduously, and striving for progress.

    The CCP Xinyang Prefectural Committee has rightly pointed out the need to share a common purpose with the masses, hitting the nail on the head. If we want to do a good job in agriculture and grain production, and truly achieve "four togethers" with the masses, a shared purpose is a fundamental starting point and a key.

    If we, the cadres sent to lower levels, want to truly contribute to the great development of agriculture and grain production, we must first share a common purpose with the commune members, give our hearts to the commune members, and share the same breath and destiny with the commune members. Only in this way can we achieve "four togethers" with the commune members, thereby gaining the trust of the commune members, drawing strength from the commune members, and leading the broad masses of commune members to achieve a glorious career in the vast rural areas.

    同心
    河南正阳县农场  刘庆澜
    最近，中共信阳地委要求全体下放干部，除和群众做好“四同”以外，还要着重同心。这一点很重要。
    事实上，我们的广大干部、青年，正是这样做的。目前，大批干部、工人、青年下乡，支援农业生产第一线，就是这种同心精神的表现。他们真正做到了和群众同吃，同住，同劳动，有事同商量，在改变穷困面貌，由低产变高产，由落后变先进方面，做出了不少的成绩。为什么能做到这样？根本的原因就是他们和群众同心，把群众的欢乐当作自己的欢乐，把群众的痛苦当作自己的痛苦，和群众一起，同心协力，克勤克俭，艰苦奋斗，发愤图强。
    中共信阳地委提出了要和群众同心，提得很对，打中了要害。要想办好农业，办好粮食，真正和群众做到“四同”，同心是个基本的出发点，是个关键。
    我们下放干部，要想真正在大办农业、大办粮食中献出一份力量，就必须首先和社员同心，把心交给社员，和社员同呼吸，共命运。这样才能和社员做到“四同”，从而取得社员的信任，从社员中汲取力量，带领广大社员，在农村广阔的天地里，干出一番辉煌的事业来。
