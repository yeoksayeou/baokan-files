Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th: According to TASS, Moscow held its annual military parade and mass procession on Red Square on November 7th, celebrating the 43rd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.

This morning, before the parade began, thousands of Muscovites—workers, scientists, cultural workers, state and social activists, and senior Soviet military officers—filled the stands on Red Square. Many foreign guests, diplomatic envoys, and military attachés from various countries to the Soviet Union were also present in the stands.

The leaders of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union, the heads of party and government delegations from various socialist countries who came to Moscow to participate in the celebration of the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Revolution, and the heads of delegations from many communist and workers' parties appeared on the reviewing stand, at which point thunderous applause resounded across Red Square.

At 10:00 a.m., the parade began. Marshal Malinovsky, Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, accompanied by General Krylov, the commander-in-chief of the parade, inspected the troops lined up on Red Square and the streets near Red Square, and congratulated the soldiers on the holiday.

Subsequently, Marshal Malinovsky ascended the reviewing stand and delivered a speech to the Soviet soldiers and officers, the Soviet working people, and foreign guests.

Marshal Malinovsky pointed out that the Soviet people are celebrating the Great October Revolution Day with outstanding new achievements in communist construction. He said, "The Soviet people are filled with determination to realize the great ideal of mankind through heroic labor—to build a communist society."

Malinovsky said that the world socialist system is exerting an increasingly strong influence on the development of the entire international situation, and it is a reliable bastion and standard-bearer of peace, freedom, and progress.

Marshal Malinovsky said that the Communist Party and the Soviet government, loyal to Lenin's teachings, have always unswervingly pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence and resolutely exposed the conspiracies of warmongers.

He said that the peaceful foreign policy pursued by the Soviet government and other socialist countries has met with fierce resistance from the imperialist aggressors headed by the United States. Under such circumstances, the Communist Party and the Soviet government must continue to strengthen the defense capabilities of their country, strengthen the Soviet armed forces, and further improve them in the future.

Malinovsky said, "Now, the Soviet Army and Navy have reached the level of the latest achievements of science and technology in terms of technical equipment and armaments, and they possess everything necessary to ensure the inviolability of the Soviet borders."

Marshal Malinovsky emphasized that the Soviet Union has never been and is not prepared to attack anyone. However, "if the imperialist bosses lose their minds and infringe upon the peaceful labor of the Soviet people, they will receive a devastating blow that no aggressor has ever suffered before."

Marshal Malinovsky said that no force in the world can stop us from marching towards communism.

After the speech, the parade commenced.

Among the troops receiving the review were models of the Soviet Union's new military technology. The rocket forces—representatives of the newest type of Soviet armed forces—passed through Red Square.

Soviet workers, engineers, and scientists have manufactured various types of rockets for different purposes—from rockets with ranges of tens and hundreds of kilometers to rockets with virtually unlimited ranges. Leading the procession was a jet device, the prototype of which was the famous "Katyusha" during the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945. Now, the firepower of this equipment has become more accurate, more destructive, and their range has been greatly increased.

People saw automatic devices equipped with anti-aircraft rockets on the square. This type of rocket can accurately hit aircraft and unmanned devices flying at high altitudes. The American "U-2" spy plane that invaded the Soviet Union on May 1 this year was shot down by this type of rocket in one fell swoop.

The caliber of the rockets is getting larger and larger. Long metal "cigars" placed on special vehicles move slowly forward. Now, the weapons equipped by the Soviet armed forces have a firepower that no army has ever had before. Giant ballistic rockets with long range, high speed, and high flight can hit predetermined targets extremely accurately under any weather conditions. The firepower of this type of rocket is virtually impossible to counter.

Rocket technology aroused great interest from everyone in the stands. Applause resounded from the stands from time to time.

According to tradition, the parade began with the cadets of various military academies as the vanguard. They are worthy successors to the glorious tradition of the defenders of the socialist motherland. People gathered in Red Square welcomed the Soviet naval forces, border guards, and the youngest participants in the parade—students from the Suvorov Military School and the Nakhimov Naval School with applause.

The Taman Mechanized Division, which achieved great success in World War II, passed in a solemn formation in front of the reviewing stand. Paratroopers and landing forces—airborne marine corps soldiers—passed through Red Square by car.

Then, the artillery forces were reviewed. Anti-tank guns, medium-caliber guns, and long-range artillery passed in front of the reviewing stand.

The parade lasted forty minutes. After the parade, the festive procession of the working people of Moscow began.

Leading the procession was a motorcade with hundreds of bright red flags. At the front of the motorcade was a huge portrait of Lenin, the great leader of the October Revolution and the founder of the Soviet state. On the huge red banner was written the most sacred slogan of every Soviet person: "Lenin is with us!"

Neat ranks of athletes in brightly colored costumes entered Red Square. Subsequently, a group of children ran out of a row of small carriages towed by cars. They boarded the reviewing stand and, amid thunderous applause, presented bouquets of flowers to Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Kozlov, Kosygin, Brezhnev, and other leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, as well as the heads of party and government delegations from socialist countries and the heads of delegations from many other countries' communist and workers' parties.

According to tradition, twelve hundred flag bearers walked at the front of the ranks of the working people from various districts of Moscow. The marching crowds held high banners with slogans reflecting the common aspirations of the Soviet people: "The Seven-Year Plan—Complete it ahead of schedule!" The procession included models of new types of machines, instruments, and new products manufactured by Moscow factories, these great achievements that the Soviet people used to greet the third year of the Seven-Year Plan.

Members of the "Communist Labor Brigade" passed through Red Square. Their ranks held high banners with the words: "We will march towards the victory of communist labor!"

Old Bolsheviks who had the honor of meeting Lenin and working under his leadership also participated in the procession. They received a particularly warm welcome from the people.

The procession of Soviet scientists was also greeted with thunderous applause. They held aloft models of artificial satellites, spaceships, and markers with the Soviet emblem that landed on the surface of the moon, as well as photos of the far side of the moon, and images of the first "space travelers" who safely returned to Earth - the puppies "Belka" and "Strelka."

Throughout the entire procession, Red Square echoed with music, songs, and laughter, and everywhere were cheerful, smiling faces.

When the national flags of various socialist countries appeared on Red Square, people shouted long live and cheered for the eternal, unbreakable friendship with the working people of great China, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.

From Moscow's Red Square, the Soviet people warmly saluted the Congolese people who are fighting for national independence and for safeguarding the territorial integrity of the Republic of Congo; and warmly saluted the heroic Cuban people who are building a new life and fighting selflessly for their national freedom and independence. They also cheered for the friendly peaceful cause of friendship with the people of the United States, Britain, France and other countries.

The last group of marchers entered Red Square. They ran towards the reviewing stand and applauded the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet government for a long time. Cheers and answering applause resounded from the stands. Slogans of "Glory to the Party!" and "Glory to the Soviet people!" rose and fell in Red Square. The festive procession lasted about three hours.

    庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年
    莫斯科举行盛大阅兵和游行
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：11月7日，莫斯科红场上举行了一年一度的阅兵和群众游行，庆祝十月社会主义革命四十三周年。
    今天早晨，在阅兵开始前，成千上万的莫斯科人——工人、科学家、文化工作者、国家和社会活动家、苏联高级军官站满了红场的观礼台。观礼台上还有许多外国来宾以及各国驻苏联的外交使节和武官。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人，前来莫斯科参加伟大的十月革命四十三周年庆典的各个社会主义国家的党政代表团团长和许多国家的共产党和工人党代表团团长出现在检阅台上，这时，红场上响起了暴风雨般的掌声。
    上午十时，阅兵开始。苏联国防部长马利诺夫斯基元帅在阅兵总指挥克雷洛夫大将的陪同下，检阅了排列在红场上和红场附近街道上的部队，并向军人祝贺节日。
    随后，马利诺夫斯基元帅登上了检阅台，向苏军士兵和军官、苏联劳动人民和外国来宾发表了演说。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅指出，苏联人民用共产主义建设中的杰出的新成就来庆祝伟大的十月革命节。他说：“苏联人民充满决心，要以英勇的劳动来实现人类的伟大理想——建立起共产主义社会。”
    马利诺夫斯基说，世界社会主义体系对整个国际事态的发展进程起着日益强烈的影响，它是和平、自由和进步的可靠堡垒和旗手。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，忠于列宁遗训的共产党和苏联政府始终不渝地奉行着和平共处政策，坚决揭露战争挑拨者的阴谋。
    他说，苏联政府和其他社会主义国家政府奉行的和平外交政策，遇到了以美国为首的帝国主义侵略势力的激烈的抗拒。在这种情况下，共产党和苏联政府不得不在今后继续加强自己国家的国防力量，加强苏联武装部队，并使之进一步完善。
    马利诺夫斯基说：“现在，苏联陆军和海军在技术装备和军备上已经达到了科学技术最新成就的水平，它们拥有保障苏联国境不受侵犯所必需的一切。”
    马利诺夫斯基元帅强调指出，苏联过去和现在都不准备进攻任何人。但是，“如果帝国主义头子失去理智，侵犯苏联人的和平劳动的话，他们得到的将是任何侵略者都还不曾遭到过的毁灭性的回击”。
    马利诺夫斯基元帅说，世界上没有任何力量能够阻止我们向共产主义迈进。
    演说结束后，阅兵分列式开始。
    在接受检阅的队伍中，有苏联的新式军事技术的模型。火箭部队——最新型的苏联武装部队的代表通过了红场。
    苏联工人、工程师和科学家制造了各种类型的、不同用途的火箭——从射程为数十公里和数百公里的火箭到射程实际上无限远的火箭。走在队伍前面的是一种喷气装置，它们的原型是1941—1945年伟大卫国战争期间著名的“卡秋莎”。现在，这种设备的火力变得更加准确，毁灭性更强，它们的射程也大大提高了。
    人们在广场上看到了装有高射火箭的自动装置。这种火箭能够准确地击落在高空飞行的飞机和无人驾驶的装置。今年5月1日，侵入苏联的美国“U—2型”间谍飞机就是被这种火箭一举击落的。
    火箭的口径越来越大。安置在特制的车子上的长长的金属“雪茄”缓缓前进。现在，苏联武装部队所配备的武器，其火力是任何一支军队所从来不曾有过的。射程远、速度快、飞得高的巨型弹道火箭，无论在什么气象条件下，都能极其准确地击中预定的目标。这种火箭的火力打击，实际上是无法回击的。
    火箭技术引起了观礼台上所有的人的极大兴趣。观礼台上不时响起掌声。
    按照传统，阅兵分列式是以各个军事学院的学员为前导的。他们不愧为社会主义祖国保卫者的光荣传统的继承者。聚集在红场的人们以掌声欢迎苏联海军部队、边防战士和阅兵式的最年轻的参加者——苏沃洛夫军事学校和纳希莫夫军事学校的学生。
    在第二次世界大战中战绩卓著的塔曼机械化师团以庄严的队伍通过检阅台前面，伞兵和登陆部队——空军陆战队战士乘汽车通过红场。
    接着，炮兵部队接受检阅，反坦克炮、中口径炮和远射程大炮在检阅台前面通过。
    阅兵共历时四十分钟。阅兵结束后，莫斯科劳动人民的节日游行开始。
    走在游行队伍前面的是插着数百面鲜红旗帜的汽车纵队，纵队的最前面高竖着十月革命的伟大领袖、苏维埃国家的奠基人列宁的巨幅肖像。在巨大的红色横幅上写着每个苏联人最神圣的口号：“列宁和我们在一起！”
    穿着鲜艳服装的运动员的整齐队伍走进了红场。随后，从汽车牵引的一列小车厢里跑出一群孩子。他们登上了检阅台，在暴风雨般的掌声中，把一束束鲜花献给赫鲁晓夫、米高扬、科兹洛夫、柯西金、勃列日涅夫和共产党和苏联政府的其他领导人，以及社会主义国家党政代表团团长和其他许多国家的共产党和工人党代表团团长。
    根据传统，一千二百名旗手走在莫斯科各区劳动人民的队伍的最前面。游行队伍高举着大旗，上面写着反映苏联人民的共同愿望的口号：“七年计划——提前完成！”游行队伍中有莫斯科各工厂制造的新型机器、仪器和新产品的模型，这些巨大的成就是苏联人用以迎接七年计划第三年的标志。
    “共产主义劳动队”的成员通过红场。他们的队伍高举着旗帜，上面写着：“我们将走向共产主义劳动的胜利！”
    曾经荣幸地同列宁会过面、并在他的领导下工作过的老布尔什维克们也参加了游行，他们受到了人们特别热烈的欢迎。
    人们还以暴风雨般的掌声欢迎苏联科学家的游行队伍。他们高举着人造卫星、宇宙飞船和落在月球表面上的带有苏联国徽的标记的模型，以及月球背面的照片、第一批安全返回地面的“宇宙旅行家”——小狗“松鼠”和“小箭”的形象。
    在整个游行过程中，红场上一直回荡着乐声、歌声和笑声，到处都是兴高采烈、喜笑颜开的面孔。
    当各个社会主义国家的国旗在红场上出现时，人们高呼万岁，欢呼同伟大的中国、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克的劳动人民的永恒的、牢不可破的友谊。
    苏联人民从莫斯科红场上向为争取民族独立、为维护刚果共和国领土完整而斗争的刚果人民热烈致敬；向正在建设新生活和为自己的民族自由和独立而忘我斗争的英雄的古巴人民热烈致敬。他们还为同美英法和其他国家人民的有利和平事业的友谊而欢呼。
    最后一批游行队伍进入了红场。他们奔向检阅台，向共产党和苏联政府的领导人长时间鼓掌。台上响起了欢呼声和回答的掌声。“光荣属于党！”“光荣属于苏联人民！”的口号声在红场上此起彼伏。节日游行历时约三小时。
