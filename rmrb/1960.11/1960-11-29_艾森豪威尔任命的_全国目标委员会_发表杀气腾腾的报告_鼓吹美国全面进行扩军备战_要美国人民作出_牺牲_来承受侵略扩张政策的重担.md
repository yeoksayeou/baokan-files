Xinhua News Agency, November 28th, Washington Dispatch: The so-called U.S. "National Goals Commission," appointed by U.S. President Eisenhower specifically to study the policy objectives and plans for the United States over the next decade, issued a report on the 28th, vigorously advocating for further U.S. military expansion, preparedness, and aggressive expansionism.

This commission, composed of former Secretary of the Army Pace, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gruenther, DuPont CEO Greenewalt, and presidential science advisor Killian, among others, in its report, dubbed "Eisenhower's Legacy to the New Administration," vehemently vilified socialist countries, alleging that they were engaging in "aggression and subversion" and exerting "military threats" against other nations. Under the guise of anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric, the report vigorously advocated that the United States intensify its war preparations in order to seize opportunities to eliminate the socialist camp through war. The report clamored that the "obligations and interests of the United States are diametrically opposed to those of the Soviet Union," and that the United States must adopt "resolute policies" "everywhere, just as in Berlin." The report stated belligerently that the United States must fully arm itself "at all costs," and "must possess strategic and tactical forces with sufficient strength" to achieve the U.S.'s "ultimate goal" of "extending freedom to the entire world."

The report expressed particular animosity towards the Chinese people, who resolutely oppose U.S. aggression. It clamored that the United States "urgently needs" to strengthen its "defense" in the Pacific and its ties with "free Asian countries" in order to further conduct military provocations and war threats against China.

The report argued that in order to implement the U.S.'s global war preparation plan, the United States must "maintain and strengthen" the various aggressive military blocs it has cobbled together. The report emphasized, "Our obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must be unwavering. We should encourage the trend of further military integration among European member states and encourage them to assume greater responsibility. Our other military alliances and relationships in the Middle East and Asia must also be affirmed and strengthened. The Organization of American States must continue to receive our unlimited support."

The report also suggested increasing the U.S.'s annual "foreign aid" expenditure from the current 3.4 billion dollars to 5 billion to 5.5 billion dollars by 1965, in order to intensify the use of "aid" as bait to control "recipient" countries. The report also strenuously advocated for exerting pressure on other countries to further open their markets to U.S. goods in order to expand U.S. foreign trade.

The report also advocated that the United States further utilize the United Nations to carry out expansion and aggression. It emphasized that "an important goal of the United States in pursuing a strong and effective foreign policy is to maintain and strengthen the United Nations," and that the United Nations remains a "major tool that can be utilized" by the United States.

The report acknowledged that the U.S.'s intensified pursuit of its war and aggressive policies would further burden the U.S. financially. The report advocated further tightening the belts of the American people in order to maintain U.S. government spending, stating that the magnitude of U.S. government spending in the future means that U.S. taxes are unlikely to decrease in the next decade, "and may even have to increase." The report clamored that in the 1960s, every American must "assume additional personal responsibility" and make "unremitting efforts and sacrifices" to implement the reactionary policies of the U.S. ruling clique.

    艾森豪威尔任命的“全国目标委员会”发表杀气腾腾的报告
    鼓吹美国全面进行扩军备战
    要美国人民作出“牺牲”来承受侵略扩张政策的重担
    新华社28日讯　华盛顿消息：由美国总统艾森豪威尔任命专门研究美国今后十年的政策目标和计划的所谓美国“全国目标委员会”28日发表一个报告，大力鼓吹美国要进一步扩军备战和扩张侵略。
    这个由美国前陆军部长佩斯、前北大西洋集团军总司令格伦瑟、杜邦公司总经理格林沃尔特和总统科学问题专门助理基利安等人组成的委员会在它被称为“艾森豪威尔传给新政府的继承品”的报告里对社会主义国家大肆诬蔑，说什么社会主义国家在进行“侵略和颠复活动”，对其他国家实行“军事威胁”。报告在反苏反共的幌子下大力鼓吹美国加紧战争准备，以便伺机用战争手段来消灭社会主义阵营。报告叫嚷说，美国的“义务和利益同苏联人的义务和利益是针锋相对的”，美国“在任何地方都要像在柏林一样”采取“坚决的政策”。报告杀气腾腾地说，美国必须“不惜一切”充分武装起来，“必须拥有具有足够力量的战略和战术部队”，以实现美国把“自由”“扩大到全世界”的“最终目标”。
    报告对坚决反对美国侵略的中国人民特别仇视。它叫嚣美国“特别迫切需要”加强美国在太平洋的“防御”和同“自由亚洲国家”的联系，以进一步对中国进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。
    报告认为，为了推行美国的全球备战计划，美国必须“保持和加强”它拼凑的各个侵略性军事集团。报告强调说，“我们对北大西洋公约组织的义务必须毫不动摇。我们应该鼓励欧洲成员国在军事上进一步一体化的倾向，并且鼓励由它们担负更大的责任。我们在中东和亚洲的其他军事联盟和关系也必须加以肯定和加强。美洲国家组织必须继续得到我们的无限制的支持。”
    报告同时建议在1965年以前把美国每年的“对外援助”经费从目前的三十四亿美元增加到五十亿至五十五亿美元，以加紧利用“援助”为诱饵来控制“受援”国家。报告并且竭力主张对其他国家施加压力，要它们进一步为美国商品开放市场，以便扩大美国的对外贸易。
    报告还鼓吹美国进一步利用联合国来进行扩张侵略。它强调说，“美国在奉行一个有力和有效的对外政策方面的一个重要目标是保持和加强联合国”，联合国仍然是美国一个“可以利用的主要工具”。
    报告承认，美国加紧推行它的战争政策和侵略政策势将使美国的财政负担更为沉重。报告主张进一步使美国人民勒紧腰带以维持美国的政府开支，报告说，美国政府今后开支之大使今后十年里美国的赋税大概不可能减少，“甚至还不得不有所增加”。报告叫嚷在六十年代，每一个美国人都要“承担额外的个人责任”，为贯彻美国统治集团的反动政策作出“坚持不懈的努力和牺牲”。
