    One day at noon, on a path in the Tiexi District of Anshan, in the Gonghe People's Commune, an old couple was walking, one in front of the other. The old man was carrying a load of sweet potatoes on a shoulder pole, and the old woman was carrying a basket full of sweet potatoes. As they walked, the old man put down the carrying pole, turned around, and jokingly said to his wife, "You! All day long buying sweet potatoes for this family and cabbages for that family. Can't even carry them yourself and still boss me around!"

    "Oh, hurry up and walk! Aren't I doing this to ease the burden on the double-income families, so they can produce more steel!" the old woman said to the old man with a sense of reason.

    "But, you have to take care of me too!" the old man deliberately teased her.

    "Taking care of people has to be prioritized. You are recuperating at home, and they are producing at work, so who do you think should be taken care of first?" the old woman retorted righteously.

    It turns out that this old woman is named Luo Suxian, and she is sixty-two years old this year. She is the resident group leader of the Seventh Resident Committee of the Gonghe Commune. There are many double-income families living in their dormitory, and they rarely have time to take care of housework. Aunt Luo thought: Doing a good job in neighborhood mutual aid is supporting steel production, so no matter what difficulties the neighbors have, she always tries to help solve them. At first, everyone felt that Aunt Luo was old, and they were unwilling to ask her for help. However, Aunt Luo always took the initiative to come to their doors, and after a while, when everyone had something to do, they would ask Aunt Luo to take care of it. In this way, Aunt Luo, after eating breakfast every day, would carry a basket and a bag on her back, and go from the grain station to the cooperative, buying this and buying that, busy all the time. When there were too many things to carry, she would ask her old man for help. (Ren Yukun)

    老两口
    一天中午，在鞍山铁西区共和人民公社的小道上，有一对老夫妻一前一后的走着。老头子挑着一担地瓜，老太太挎个盛满地瓜的篮子。走着走着，老头子放下了扁担，回过头去向老伴打趣地说：“你呀！整天给东家买地瓜，西家买白菜的，拿不动还要抓我的差！”
    “哎呀，快走吧！我还不是为了减轻双职工的生活负担，让他们多多生产钢铁嘛！”老太太满有道理的对老头子说。
    “可是，你也得照顾照顾我呀！”老头子故意地气她。
    “照顾，也得分个轻重缓急，你在家休养，他们在班上生产，你说应该先照顾谁？”老太太理直气壮的反问了一句。
    原来，这位大娘叫罗素贤，今年六十二岁了，是共和公社第七居民委员会的居民组长。她们宿舍里住着很多双职工户，很少有时间料理家务。罗大娘想：搞好邻里互助就是支援钢铁生产，所以不论邻居有什么困难她总是想法帮助解决。开始，大家觉得罗大娘年岁大了，有事也不肯求她，可是，罗大娘老是找上门来，日子长了，大家有了什么事，也就托罗大娘给办了。就这样，罗大娘每天吃过早饭，就挎着篮子，背上袋子，从粮站到合作社，买这买那，忙个不停，东西多了，拿不动，就请老伴帮个忙。（任郁坤）
