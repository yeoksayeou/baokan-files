Develop Pig Raising Primarily Through Production Teams and Mess Halls
    Baishan Commune Withdraws a Large Number of Pig Breeders to Participate in Field Production, Pig Inventory Increases by 35% Compared to Last Year
    Songshan Commune Comprehensively Implements Policies, Effectively Solves Problems, and a New Atmosphere of More Pigs, More Fertilizer, and More Grain Appears

    (Our Report) Baishan Commune, Cangxi County, Sichuan Province, famous for "Thousands of Households, Ten Thousand Pigs," has invested 80% of its labor force in front-line field production. The number of pig breeders has been reduced by more than 11%, but the commune's current pig inventory has increased by more than 35% compared to last year.

    The continuous leap forward in pig production in Baishan Commune is primarily due to the resolute implementation of a series of Party policies for developing pig production. The commune's more than 10,000 pigs are mainly raised by the production teams and public mess halls. With more pigs, there is more fertilizer, and with more fertilizer, more grain is harvested. Commune members can receive their wages on time every month, and their lives have also improved. As a result, everyone cares about pig raising, and production team cadres are even more enthusiastic about developing pig production. In addition to the team leader in charge of pig raising staying at the pig farm with the breeders to adhere to the "four togethers," the team leader in charge of agriculture often goes to the pig farm to help feed the pigs and plant feed crops. While strengthening leadership, the commune also conscientiously implemented the pig raising reward policy, which also promoted the development of the pig raising industry.

    Another factor in the rapid development of pigs in Baishan Commune is the proper resolution of the contradiction between pig raising and field production labor. When implementing the instructions of the higher-level Party committee on strengthening the agricultural front line, some cadres raised the question of "which one should we focus on?" Some breeders said, "Reducing people will make it difficult to feed the pigs well." They believed that developing pigs required a corresponding increase in labor, which was in conflict with strengthening the agricultural front line. With the help of the county and district Party committees, the commune Party committee organized cadres and commune members to seriously discuss these issues. Through discussion, cadres and commune members clarified that developing pigs and strengthening the agricultural front line are complementary and mutually reinforcing, with both contradictory and mutually promoting aspects. The commune Party committee affirmed in the discussion that developing pigs can increase fertilizer and increase grain production. At the same time, it guided everyone to discuss the benefits of agricultural production increases for pig development. During the discussion, everyone calculated: Although Baishan Commune is located in a mountainous area, there is a lot of wild and planted feed, but 30% of the feed for each pig still comes from agricultural and sideline products, such as straw and bean leaves. Therefore, only with the development of agriculture can pigs have greater development.

    How to resolve the contradiction between the breeding industry and the planting industry competing for labor? The commune Party committee first clearly pointed out that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. At a time when the whole Party and the whole people are running agriculture and grain production in a big way, the animal husbandry front should withdraw labor to support the agricultural front line. Then, the commune Party committee adopted several methods and successively withdrew 77 people from the breeders to invest in agricultural production. At the same time, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor on the animal husbandry front, it also organized breeders and those engaged in field production to cooperate and support each other. For example, in March and April this year, the peak season for spring grass growth, there was an urgent need to vigorously collect and store wild feed, and some feed plots also needed to be planted in a timely manner. At this time, the summer harvest and summer planting had not yet arrived, and agricultural work was relatively idle. Under the unified deployment of the commune Party committee, the production teams organized forces to concentrate on collecting and storing wild feed and planting feed plots. June and July were also the peak season for wild feed growth, and the autumn harvest and autumn planting had not yet arrived. The production teams again dispatched some people to help concentrate on collecting and storing wild feed. With the large number of people and strong forces on the agricultural front line, the quantity of wild feed collected and stored was very large, and the feed plots were also planted in a timely manner. Planting feed plots and collecting and storing wild feed are the main tasks of pig raising. After this problem was solved, the breeders were willing to support field production during the busy farming season. For example, in March and April, when the feed was just planted, all 112 people specializing in feed went to help with the summer harvest and summer planting. After the summer harvest and summer planting were completed, they came back to manage the feed plots. During this year's autumn harvest, some breeding farms took on all the drying and storage work. These facts show that as long as labor is properly arranged, it is possible to ensure a double leap forward in agriculture and animal husbandry.

    In addition to taking the time to help collect and store wild feed and plant feed plots, the labor force on the agricultural front line also achieved a combination of three aspects based on the characteristics of various agricultural tasks: First, weeding and cultivating were combined with collecting feed, and cooked grass, barnyard grass, and chicken feather mushrooms were brought back to the mess hall for breeders to collect and store; Second, when digging grass skins to accumulate fertilizer, the feed was picked up first, and then the pits were soaked for composting; Third, when vegetable gardeners were preparing the garden land, they picked up the residual leaves and root pieces as feed first, and then dug the ground. In this way, it not only increased the feed but also reduced the workload of the breeders.

    The commune Party committee also strengthened ideological education for the breeders in leading pig raising work and launched the "Three Highs" (high pig raising efficiency, high sow farrowing rate, high pig output rate) competition among the breeders, calling on everyone to be an all-round red banner bearer in pig raising. This has also played an important role in accelerating the development of the pig raising industry.

    (Our Report from Nanning, November 25th) In pig production, Songshan People's Commune in Bobai County, Guangxi, insisted on implementing public raising primarily through production teams and mess halls, and encouraged commune members to raise pigs. Therefore, the pig raising industry has developed rapidly, and a new atmosphere of more pigs, more fertilizer, and more grain has appeared everywhere.

    According to statistics from this commune on November 15, the average number of live pigs in the commune reached 4.6 per household, an increase of 98.5% compared to the end of last year. Among them, pig raising by production teams and mess halls accounted for 46%, an increase of 179% compared to the end of last year; pig raising by commune and brigade pig farms accounted for 30.1%, an increase of 39% compared to the end of last year; pig raising by commune member households accounted for 23.9%, an increase of 91.8% compared to last year. Due to the rapid development of the pig raising industry, the amount of refined fertilizer (most of which is pig manure) used for early and late season crops this year has more than doubled compared to last year. Under the threat of this year's severe drought, the total output of early season crops still increased compared to the same period last year. Although the winter planting area this year has expanded by more than 5,000 mu compared to last year, there is an average of more than 12 dan of pig manure per mu.

    The rapid development of the pig raising industry in Songshan Commune is inseparable from the commune Party committee's conscientious implementation of the pig raising policy of public raising as the mainstay, private raising as a supplement, and combining public and private raising. This spring, when the commune Party committee proposed to continue to maintain and develop the commune's and production brigade's pig farms, vigorously develop pig raising by production teams and mess halls, and actively support and encourage commune member households to raise pigs, two incorrect ideas emerged among some cadres: one was that they were afraid that production teams and mess halls raising more pigs would divert the energy of the commune and production brigade from raising pigs; the other was that they were afraid that commune member households raising pigs would affect agricultural production. In response to these ideas, the commune Party committee, on the one hand, focused on ideological education to improve cadres' understanding of the Party's policies; on the other hand, it organized cadres to visit and learn from Shanbian Brigade, which had made significant achievements in developing pig raising. Each production team and mess hall in Shanbian Brigade raised fewer pigs at the end of last year. After implementing the policy of public pig raising primarily by production teams and mess halls, the number of pigs raised by production teams and mess halls increased by more than threefold, and commune member households raised more than 480 pigs. Through on-site visits and comparisons, the ideological problems of the cadres were solved, and a climax of everyone doing their best to raise pigs appeared everywhere in the commune.

    In order to ensure the implementation of the pig raising policy, further mobilize the enthusiasm of production teams, mess halls, and commune member households to raise pigs, and vigorously develop the pig raising industry, the Songshan Commune Party Committee also adopted the following measures: First, in terms of management, Party members, Youth League members, and activists were transferred from commune and brigade pig farms to strengthen the leadership and management of pig raising by teams and mess halls. At the same time, it insisted on implementing the "four guarantees and one reward" system (that is, guaranteeing output, guaranteeing capital, guaranteeing work points, guaranteeing fertilizer, and rewarding overproduction). Second, in terms of piglet supply, the commune and brigade pig farms are responsible for self-breeding and self-raising to meet the needs of production teams, mess halls, and commune member households to raise pigs, and to help teams gradually achieve both breeding pigs and meat pigs, and achieve self-breeding and self-raising. In addition, it is also stipulated that the brigade must guarantee the supply of pig sources for commune member households to raise pigs. Third, in terms of feed, production teams are allowed to use the edges and corners of the fields to plant feed, and commune members are allowed to plant feed in their private plots.

### 以小队和食堂为主发展养猪业  白山公社抽出大批饲养员参加田间生产，圈存猪比去年增长35％  松山公社全面贯彻政策，切实解决问题，出现猪多肥多粮多新气象

    以小队和食堂为主发展养猪业
    白山公社抽出大批饲养员参加田间生产，圈存猪比去年增长35％
    松山公社全面贯彻政策，切实解决问题，出现猪多肥多粮多新气象
    本报讯　以“千户万猪”著名的四川省苍溪县白山公社，80％的劳动力投入了第一线的田间生产后，饲养员减少了11％以上，而全社现有猪只圈存数却比去年增长35％以上。
    白山公社猪只生产持续跃进，首先是坚决贯彻执行了党的发展养猪生产方面一系列的政策。全公社一万多头猪主要是由各生产队和公共食堂饲养的。猪发展得多，肥料就多，粮食收得就更多，社员每月都能按时发工资，生活也得到改善。这样，人人都关心养猪，生产队干部对发展猪只更加积极。除了专管养猪的队长固定在猪场跟饲养员坚持“四同”以外，管农业的队长还经常去猪场帮助喂猪，种饲料地。全公社在加强领导的同时，认真执行了养猪的奖励政策，也促进了养猪事业的发展。
    白山公社猪只发展得快的另一因素，是由于妥善地解决了养猪和田间生产劳动力的矛盾。在执行上级党委关于加强农业第一线的指示时，有的干部就提出“到底抓哪一头？”有的饲养员说：“减少了人就喂不好猪。”他们认为发展猪只就要相应地增加劳动力，和加强农业第一线有矛盾。社党委在县、区委的帮助下，组织干部、社员认真地讨论了这些问题。通过讨论，干部、社员明确了发展猪只和加强农业第一线是相辅相成的，既有矛盾的一面，更有互相促进的一面。社党委在讨论中肯定了发展猪只可以增加肥料，增产粮食；同时又引导大家讨论了农业增产对发展猪只的好处。大家在讨论中算了一笔账：白山公社虽然地处山区，野生和种植的饲料虽多，但每头猪仍有30％的饲料来自农副产品，如稿秆、豆叶等。因此，只有农业发展了，猪只才能有更大的发展。
    饲养业和种植业争劳动力的矛盾怎样解决？公社党委首先明确指出：农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础，在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的时候，畜牧战线应该抽出劳力支援农业第一线。接着，社党委采取几种办法，先后从饲养员中抽出了七十七人投入农业生产。在此同时为了解决畜牧战线劳力不足的困难，还组织了饲养员和搞田间生产的人互相协作支援。如今年3、4月份春草生长的旺季，急需大力采集野生饲料储存，一部分饲料地也需及时下种；而这时夏收夏种还未到来，农活比较闲，在社党委的统一部署下，各生产队组织力量突击采储野生饲料和种饲料地。6、7月份又是野生饲料生长旺季，秋收秋种还未到，各生产队又抽出一部分人帮助突击采储野生饲料。农业第一线上的人多力量大，在他们的帮助下，采储的野生饲料数量很大，饲料地也及时下了种。种饲料地和采储野生饲料，是养猪工作的大头。这个问题解决后，饲养员都乐意在农忙时支援田间生产。如3、4月份饲料刚种下，饲养员中一百一十二个专搞饲料的人，全部去帮助夏收夏种。夏收夏种完后，回来刚接上管理饲料地。今年秋收时，有的饲养场负担了全部晒藏工作。这些事实说明：只要妥善安排劳力，就可以保证农业牧业双跃进。
    农业第一线的劳动力除了抽出时间帮助采储野生饲料、下种饲料外，还根据各项农活的特点，做到了三结合：一、中耕除草结合搜集饲料，把熟草、禾稗、鸡公茸等带回食堂，由饲养员收储；二、铲草皮积肥时，先把饲料拣起，再泡坑沤肥；三、蔬菜员在整园地时，先把残叶根块拣起作饲料，再挖地。这样，既增加了饲料，又减轻了饲养人员的工作。
    这个公社党委在领导养猪工作中还加强了对饲养员的思想教育，在饲养员中开展了三高（养猪工效高、母猪产仔率高、肥猪出槽率高）竞赛运动，号召人人做养猪全能红旗手。这对加速养猪事业的发展，也起了重要作用。
    本报南宁25日电　广西博白县松山人民公社在养猪生产中，坚持执行公养以生产小队和食堂为主，并鼓励社员养猪，因此养猪事业发展很快，处处出现猪多、肥多、粮多的新气象。
    据这个公社11月15日的统计，全社生猪圈存数平均每户达四点六头，比去年底圈存数增长98.5％。其中生产小队和食堂养猪占46％，比去年底增长179％；公社和大队猪场养猪占30.1％，比去年底增长39％；社员户养猪占23.9％，比去年增长91.8％。由于养猪事业的迅速发展，今年早、晚两季农作物所用精肥（其中大部分是猪粪），比去年增加一倍多，早季作物在今年特大旱灾的威胁下，总产量仍然比去年同期增长。今年冬种面积虽然比去年扩大五千多亩，但平均每亩有猪粪达十二担之多。
    松山公社迅速发展养猪事业，是和公社党委认真贯彻执行公养为主、私养为辅、公养私养并举的养猪方针分不开的。今年春，当公社党委提出继续保持和发展公社、生产大队的养猪场，大力发展生产小队和食堂养猪，积极支持和鼓励社员户养猪的作法时，在一部分干部中出现两种不正确的思想：一种是怕生产小队和食堂多养猪，会分散公社和生产大队养猪的精力；一种是怕社员户养猪，会影响农业生产。针对这些思想，公社党委一方面抓住思想教育工作，提高干部对党的方针政策的认识水平；另一方面组织干部到发展养猪成绩较显著的山边大队参观取经。山边大队各生产小队和食堂，去年底养猪较少，贯彻公养猪以生产小队和食堂为主的方针后，生产小队和食堂的养猪头数增加了三倍多，社员户养猪达到四百八十多头。通过现场参观和对比，解决了干部的思想问题，全公社处处出现各尽所能、大养其猪的高潮。
    为了保证养猪政策的贯彻执行，进一步调动生产小队、食堂和社员户养猪的积极性，大力发展养猪事业，松山公社党委还采取了下列几项措施：一、在管理上，从公社和大队养猪场中，抽调了党、团员和积极分子，加强对小队、食堂养猪的领导和经营管理。同时，坚持执行“四包一奖”制（即包产、包资、包工分、包肥料和超产奖励）。二、在苗猪供应方面，由公社和大队的养猪场负责自繁自育，以满足生产小队、食堂以及社员户养猪的需要，帮助小队逐步实现种猪和肉猪并举，做到自繁自育。此外，还规定对社员户养猪，大队要保证供应猪源。三、在饲料方面，允许生产小队利用田边地角种植饲料，允许社员在自留地种饲料。
