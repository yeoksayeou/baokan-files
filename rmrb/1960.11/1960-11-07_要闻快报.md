Guangdong Processes Waste to Accumulate Fertilizer
Many areas in Guangdong Province are vigorously managing and harmlessly treating manure, garbage, and sewage, accumulating large amounts of organic fertilizer and improving environmental sanitation. Many production teams or natural villages in rural people's communes have established simple fertilizer plants as bases for accumulating and producing fertilizer and conducting harmless treatment.
