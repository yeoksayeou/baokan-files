As soon as you arrive in Fuxin, you get a prominent feeling: first, there's a lot of coal; second, there are a lot of "Dragon Trains," and even more "Dragon Trains" heading to Anshan Iron and Steel.

On the night of October 8th, the Fuxin transportation dispatching building was a scene of intense activity. Below the dispatching building was the Fuxin Municipal Party Committee's transportation command post. Since the winter of 1958, leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee in charge of transportation work have moved their offices to the site, commanding transportation from the front lines.

According to the plan, an "Advanced Dragon Train" would depart for Anshan around six o'clock the next morning. At the pre-shift meeting, the Secretary of the Fuxin Coal Mine Marketing Department Party Committee made a political mobilization. The workers were in high spirits, and everyone seized the time to prepare. At four o'clock in the morning, as soon as the empty train entered the station, Li Zhendong, the Secretary of the Marketing Department Party Committee, took the lead in running out, and together with the commanders and dispatchers, helped close the car doors and plug the gaps. This greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the loading workers. The "Dragon Train," which might have been delayed, was finally loaded and assembled on time. As the morning light dawned in the east, a train full of coal, the "grain" for the steel marshal, slowly departed from Fuxin Station.

After the "Dragon Train" departed, in addition to adding coal and water at Juluhe Station, all stations along the way greeted it with green lights. Empty trains yielded the way, and loaded trains moved out of the path. It truly sped by like a whirlwind. It usually takes ten hours to travel from Fuxin to Sujiatun, but this "Dragon Train" arrived in Sujiatun at noon. The "Dragon Train" was not disassembled and reassembled here, but simply switched locomotives and crew, and then continued to drive towards the steel capital.

Despite the heavy rains this year, Fuxin did not send a single ton of coal less to the steel capital. During the severe floods in southern Liaoning, Fuxin coal was also shipped to Dalian via Qinhuangdao and then transferred to Anshan, ensuring the supply of "fine grain" for Anshan Iron and Steel. The support of the coal miners and transport workers deeply touched the hearts of the Anshan Iron and Steel workers. Li Yuxian, the leader of the Class A shift of the No. 6 furnace in the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, said it well: "We will respond to their support not with words, but with steel."

### 一路绿灯迎“龙车”

    一路绿灯迎“龙车”
    一到阜新，就有个突出的感觉：一是煤多，二是“龙车”多，开往鞍钢的“龙车”更多。
    10月8日夜，阜新运输调度小楼上一片紧张忙碌的气氛。在调度楼下，就是中共阜新市委的运输指挥部。从1958年冬天开始，市委负责运输工作的领导同志们，就把办公室搬到现场，在第一线指挥运输。
    按照计划，第二天黎明六点钟左右，将有一列“高级龙车”开往鞍山。在班前会上，阜新煤矿运销部党委书记作了政治动员。工人们情绪都很高，大家抓紧时间作好准备工作。凌晨四点钟，空车刚进站，运销部党委书记李振东便带头跑出去，和指挥员、调度员等一起，帮助关车门的关车门，堵窟窿的堵窟窿。这一下，装车工人干劲更大了。本来可能晚点的“龙车”，终于按时装满编好。当晨光微明东方发亮时，一列煤车便满载钢帅“粮食”，徐徐从阜新车站开动了。
    “龙车”出发以后，除在巨流河站添煤、加水以外，沿途各站都以绿灯相迎，空车让路，重车躲道，真是风驰电掣，不停地穿越而过。从阜新到苏家屯，一般需要十来个钟头，这列“龙车”却在中午就到达了苏家屯。“龙车”在这里也不重新解体另编，只是换过机车和乘务员，就接着向钢都驶去。
    今年下那么大的雨，阜新没有少运给钢都一吨煤。辽南发大水期间，阜新煤还绕道秦皇岛海运大连，转到鞍山，保证了鞍钢的“细粮”供应。煤矿和运输工人的支援，深深地打动着鞍钢职工的心。鞍钢第一炼钢厂六号炉甲班炉长李玉贤说得好：“我们回答他们的支援，不是用语言，而是用钢铁。”（地）
