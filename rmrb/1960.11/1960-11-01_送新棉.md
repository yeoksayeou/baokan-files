Delivering New Cotton
    Wen Bin, Xin Liang, Shi Tao

October is the season when new cotton comes on the market. The Qixian Cotton Purchasing Station in Fengxian County, a suburb of Shanghai, is extremely lively. At dawn or dusk, a distant view from the nearby Qixian Bridge reveals a constant flow of boats laden with cotton bales on the Jinhui River, while on the wide road, teams carrying snow-white cotton are endlessly moving. Members of the Jinhui Commune enthusiastically bring collective deliveries of seed cotton to the purchasing station for sale before going to the fields or after finishing work. These days, the Qixian Station receives more than 100,000 jin of cotton every day, which is rarely seen in previous years.

    Harvest Quickly, Sell Quickly

This year, the Jinhui Commune's more than 24,000 mu of cotton is growing very well. When we arrived at the commune, the first and second flushes of cotton had already been picked, and the autumn bolls hanging on the cotton stalks had also burst open and produced lint. Among the cotton plants, groups of women were bending over, skillfully picking cotton. Bags of clean seed cotton are transported from the fields to the production team's drying grounds.

The Jinhui Commune plants both grain and cotton, with the area of rice slightly larger than that of cotton. It is necessary to vigorously develop grain production and also greatly develop non-staple foods, as well as carry out the autumn harvest while also doing a good job in autumn plowing and autumn planting. The arrangement of labor is indeed a problem. The commune party committee skillfully uses its manpower, focusing the steel on the blade. In the early morning, male commune members dredged mud to accumulate fertilizer, and female commune members cut grass to store winter feed. Near noon, when the dew on the cotton had dissipated, hundreds of cotton-picking groups of women were fully mobilized. Pick each flower as it opens, harvest each patch as it ripens. In the evening, as the men returned from the fields, workshops, and pigpen construction sites, the women and elderly people who had been picking cotton had already packed the cotton they had picked, dried, and cleaned the day before into sacks. The cadres then joined everyone in a mighty procession to the purchasing station. In this way, every day the entire commune has three or four thousand people active in the cotton fields, achieving quick picking, quick drying, quick cleaning, and quick selling.

The enthusiasm of the commune members is very high! Twenty-six production teams have all resolved to compete for the top spot in cotton picking and selling. Many commune members are learning to pick cotton with both hands at the same time. Young woman Zhu Caixian can see accurately and pick cleanly, and actually picked 104 jin in half a day. Her companions all praised her as a cotton-picking expert. Commune members not only strive to pick quickly and pick a lot, but also pay attention to cotton quality everywhere. They carefully remove impurities and stiff petals mixed in with the seed cotton, separate wet flowers from dry flowers, and separate white flowers from yellow flowers. Almost no fallen cotton flowers can be seen in the warehouses or on the drying grounds.

    "Logistics" to the Front Line

These days, commercial workers, who serve as a link between production and sales, are even more active. Whether at the flower drying grounds, warehouses, or in villages and fields, the staff of the commune's supply and marketing cooperative can be seen.

One day, Xu Fulin from the supply and marketing cooperative came to the Wuzhai Production Team. He reported a situation to the production team leader: a lot of cotton was piled up in the warehouses of some production teams, and some of it in the middle had started to heat up, requiring emergency treatment. After the two discussed the matter, they realized that the key was that there were many people picking cotton, but few people delivering it to the purchasing station. The production team immediately organized more than 100 male and female commune members to carry out a crash program of drying, cleaning, and selling. But they encountered a new difficulty: there were not enough frames and bamboo poles for drying the flowers. Old Xu introduced the advanced experience of other communes: using four wooden stakes to replace the flower drying frame, and using the bamboo from the windmill shed that was not needed at the moment to replace the bamboo poles. Through four crash programs, all the cotton stored in the warehouse was sold out.

The purchasing station warmly receives the commune members who come to sell cotton. For commune members who come from far away and are tired or thirsty, the purchasing station prepares tea and towels for them to rest well. Buying cotton with high quality and at a good price is fair and reasonable, and the commune members are even more satisfied. Next to the delivery yard, there is a democratic grading platform displaying many samples of cotton grades. Before the transaction, the inspector quotes a price according to the quality, and if the commune members have any questions, they can compare with the samples and raise their opinions for re-grading.

    Clever Loading, More Transportation

On the transportation line, everyone is racing against time to quickly transport more new cotton. The boatmen of the commune's transportation station said it well: if seed cotton is sent to the ginning mill and lint is sent to the spinning mill one day earlier, then more and better cloth can be produced one day earlier.

The Jinhui River runs through the Jinhui Commune. Here, material transportation mainly relies on wooden boats. Wooden boats are small in size and have no power equipment, so they cannot move against the tide. Experienced boatmen can calculate the time of daily tidal rise and fall. They load the seed cotton in advance in the morning, and go downstream with the tide as soon as it comes. When they arrive at the ginning mill located in the middle section of the Jinhui River, they unload immediately and return during the ebb tide; then they load seed cotton again and run back and forth during the evening tide.

The purchasing station receives more and more cotton, but there are only nineteen wooden boats, and some of them also need to transport construction equipment, raw materials, grain, and fertilizer... What to do? The boatmen used their brains and found a clever solution: two small boats are lined up side by side, and deck boards are laid in the middle. The sides of the boat that could not be loaded in the past are now also filled with cotton; and the bottom of the boat is wider, so the cotton bales can be stacked even higher. Two boats running like this can load one-third more cotton than a single boat. (Attached picture)

    送新棉
    文斌　信良　世涛
    10月，新棉登场的季节。上海郊区奉贤县的齐贤棉花收购站热闹非凡。黎明或是薄暮时分，登上附近的齐贤桥远眺，这边金汇江上，满载棉包的船只川流不息；那头宽阔的公路上，肩挑皑皑白花的队伍络绎不绝。金汇公社的社员们在下田前、收工后，兴高采烈地把籽棉集体送到收购站出售。这些日子，齐贤站每天收进的棉花有十多万斤，这是往年很少见的。
        快摘　快售
    今年，金汇公社的二万四千多亩棉花长得挺好。我们来到公社的时候，头潮和二潮花已经摘过，挂在棉株腰部的伏桃也已破桃吐絮。棉株丛中，成群的妇女弯着腰熟练地在摘花。一袋袋洁白的籽棉从田头送往生产队的晒场。
    金汇公社粮棉并种，水稻的面积还比棉花多一点。既要大办粮食，又要大搞副食品；既要搞好秋收，又要搞好秋耕、秋种。劳动力的安排确实是个问题。公社党委巧用兵将，把钢用在刀口上。清晨，男社员罱泥积肥，女社员割草储藏过冬饲料。近午，棉花上的露水消了，几百个摘棉小组的妇女全面出动。开一朵，采一朵，熟一片，摘一片。傍晚，男人们从田间、作坊、搭猪棚的工地归来，拣花的妇女和老人们已经把头天采下来晒干拣净的棉花装好麻包，干部们便和大家一起，浩浩荡荡地把它们送往收购站。就这样，每天整个公社有三、四千人活跃在棉田里，做到了快摘、快晒、快拣、快售。
    社员们的干劲可高啦！二十六个生产队都下了决心，要在摘棉、售棉中争个上游。许多社员学着用双手同时摘花。青年姑娘朱才仙看得准、摘得净，半天里竟然摘了一百零四斤，同伴们都夸她是摘棉能手。社员们不但力求摘得快、摘得多，还处处注意棉花质量。他们细心地把混在籽棉中的杂质、僵瓣剔掉，把湿花和干花分开，把白花和黄花分开。仓库里、晒场上几乎看不到一朵遗落的棉花。
      “后勤”上前线
    这些日子，作为产销纽带的商业工作人员更加活跃了。无论在晒花场、仓库，还是在村边、田头，都可以看到公社供销部的工作人员。
    一天，供销部的徐福林来到五宅生产队。他向生产队长汇报了一个情况：有些生产小队的仓库里堆着不少棉花，一部分夹在中间的已经发热，需要紧急处理。两个人一商量，关键在于摘花的人多，向收购站送花的人少。生产队马上组织了一百多个男女社员，突击晒拣和交售。可是又碰到了新困难，晒花用的架子和竹杠不足。老徐就介绍别的公社的先进经验：用四根木桩代替晒花架子，用眼前不需要的风车篷竹代替竹杠。通过四次突击，仓库里的存棉统统卖光。
    收购站热情地接待上门卖花的社员。远道赶来的社员累了、渴了，收购站里备着茶水、毛巾，让他们好好休息。收购棉花优质优价，公平合理，社员们更是满意。在交货场旁边，有一个民主评级台，陈列着许多棉花等级的样品。成交之前，检验员按质报价，社员有疑问可以对照着样品提出意见，重新评级。
        巧装　多运
    运输线上，人人都在争分夺秒，快运多运新棉。公社运输站的船工们说得好：早一天把籽棉送去轧花，把皮棉送去纺纱，就能早一天生产出更多更好的布匹来。
    金汇江穿过金汇公社。这里，物资运输主要依靠木船。木船体积小，又没有动力设备，顶着潮水走不动。有经验的船工能算得出每天潮水涨落的时间。他们早晨预先把籽棉装好，潮水一到就顺流而下，到达座落在金汇江中段的轧花厂马上就卸，抢在退潮时回来；接着再装籽棉，在晚潮时跑个来回。
    收购站收的棉花越来越多，但是木船只有十九条，一部分还要运建筑器材、原料、粮食、肥料……。怎么办？船工们开动脑筋，找到了一个巧办法：两只小船并排靠在一起，中间铺上舱板，过去不能装货的船舷，现在也放了棉花；而且船底阔了，棉包可以堆得更高。两只船这样跑一趟，就比单只走多装三分之一的棉花。（附图片）
