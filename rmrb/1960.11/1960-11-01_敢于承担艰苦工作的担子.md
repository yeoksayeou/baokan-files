    Daring to Take on the Burden of Hard Work
    Yi Qing
    "Hard work is like a burden placed before us, to see if we dare to take it on" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, page 1160). The most valuable aspect of the working spirit of elementary school teacher Jia Zhonggao is that he understands Comrade Mao Zedong's teaching and dares to take on the burden of hard work.
    Look: The place where the school is located is a remote and deep mountain valley where schools have never been established in history. The entire foundation of the school consists of several dilapidated earthen cave dwellings. The person running the school is a Communist Party member from a poor peasant background who only attended elementary school for two years—Jia Zhonggao. The work cannot but be arduous. However, this Communist Party member finally managed to do this difficult work with great success. The school was quickly established and run very well, beloved by the masses, and became a red banner for private elementary schools nationwide.
    What is the secret to this? The secret lies in the fact that Jia Zhonggao is a person who firmly believes that "listening to the Party can overcome difficulties," a person who dares to take on heavy burdens, and a person who dares to create a home through arduous struggle in a place that is "poor and blank" by using "poor methods."
      "Poor methods"—what a familiar term, and what a great term, for the 650 million Chinese people! It is the method that we Chinese Communists have always adopted. Because we are a country led by the proletariat, and a "poor and blank" country, the proletariat leading a "poor and blank" country in revolution and construction means starting from scratch, which means building a home using poor methods. The experience of the Chinese revolution and construction proves that starting from scratch and using poor methods not only built a home, but also made our "home" bigger, stronger, and richer. People who are a little older probably still remember: In the arduous years of the revolutionary war, we did not have airplanes and artillery, we only had millet and rifles, and even millet and rifles were scarce. What should we do? Just as a folk song at the time sang: Without guns, without cannons, the enemy makes them for us. It was by seizing the enemy's weapons that we strengthened ourselves. This is a wonderful poor method. This poor method was very effective. It helped us finally eliminate the enemy and win the victory of the revolutionary war. In the construction era, we also created many poor methods, such as "small native groups," "ants gnawing at bones," and so on. These poor methods were also very effective. They helped us achieve a great leap forward in construction. When Jia Zhonggao started the school, he had nothing but a few broken cave dwellings, only yellow earth all over the mountains and fields. He used yellow earth to make mud tables, mud benches, earthen slates, and earthen chalk. This is another poor method, but it made the Jinmaju Elementary School possible. Poor methods have written brilliant and splendid poems for the Chinese people.
    However, to be good at creating this kind of "poor method," one must be a person who dares to take on the burden of hard work, a person who has the courage to overcome difficulties with unyielding determination. With this kind of revolutionary spirit and courage, one can give full play to one's intelligence and talent, and come up with endless methods when it seems that there is no way. In those years, when we didn't even have enough millet and rifles, we were able to create such a wonderful poor method as "the enemy makes them for us," precisely because we had this revolutionary spirit and courage. Jia Zhonggao was able to start a school in a place that was without anything and seemed difficult to start a school, using poor methods, also because he had this revolutionary spirit and courage. It can be seen that the soul and essence hidden in the poor methods is precisely the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This revolutionary spirit is much stronger than any ready-made material conditions, and it can trample and crush any great difficulties. And this spirit can only be possessed by conscious people under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    Jia Zhonggao starting an elementary school may not seem like a very remarkable or extraordinary thing, but his working spirit is indeed extraordinary. Doing work is like carrying a burden, "Burdens have light ones and heavy ones. Some people pick light burdens and are afraid of heavy ones, pushing the heavy burdens to others and picking the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude. Some comrades are not like this. They give enjoyment to others and pick heavy burdens to carry, enduring hardship before others and enjoying after others. Such comrades are good comrades. We should all learn this spirit of communists." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, page 1160). Jia Zhonggao has this spirit of a communist, and therefore we must learn from him.

    敢于承担艰苦工作的担子
    怡清
    “艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担”（“毛泽东选集”第四卷第1160页）。小学教师贾仲高工作精神的最可贵之处，就在于他懂得毛泽东同志的这个教导，敢于承担艰苦工作的担子。
    你看：办学的地方是一个历史上从没有办过学校的偏僻深山沟，办学的全部家底是几孔破土窑洞，办学的人是一个只念过二年小学的贫农出身的共产党员——贾仲高。工作不能不是艰苦的。但是，这个共产党员终于把这件艰苦的工作办得很有成绩。学校很快办起来了，而且办得很好，为群众所热爱，是全国民办小学的一面红旗。
    这其中的奥妙何在呢？奥妙就在于贾仲高是一个坚信“听党的话就能克服困难”的人，一个敢于挑起重担子的人，一个敢于经过艰苦奋斗，用“穷办法”在“一穷二白”的地方创立家业的人。
      “穷办法”，对于六亿五千万中国人民来说，是一个多么熟悉的名词，又是一个多么伟大的名词。它是我们中国共产党人从来就采取的办法。因为我们是无产阶级领导的国家，又是“一穷二白”的国家，无产阶级领导“一穷二白”的国家闹革命，闹建设，就是要白手起家，也就是要用穷办法兴家。中国革命和建设的经验证明：白手、穷办法不仅起了家，而且使得我们的“家”越来越大，越来越强，越来越富。年龄稍大一点的人大概都还记得：在艰苦的革命战争年代，我们没有飞机大炮，有的只是小米加步枪，甚至连小米加步枪也很少，怎么办呢？正如当时一首歌谣里所唱的一样：没有枪，没有炮，敌人给我们造。就是靠夺取敌人的武器来壮大自己。这是一条绝妙的穷办法。这条穷办法很有效，它帮助了我们终于消灭了敌人，取得了革命战争的胜利；在建设年代，我们也创造了许多穷办法，有“小土群”，有“蚂蚁啃骨头”等等，这些穷办法也很有效，它帮助了我们取得建设事业的大跃进。贾仲高开始办学时，除了几孔破窑洞以外，什么也没有，只有满山遍野的黄土，他就用黄土造泥桌、泥凳、土石板、土粉笔，这又是穷办法，可是，它使金马驹小学办起来了。穷办法给中国人民写下了光辉灿烂的诗篇。
    但是，要善于创造出这种“穷办法”，只有敢于承担艰苦工作担子的人，只有具有百折不挠克服困难的勇气的人，才能做到。有了这种革命精神和勇气，才能发挥出聪明才智，在看来是没有办法的时候，想出无穷无尽的办法。当年，我们连小米加步枪都不够的时候，能创造出“敌人给我们造”这样绝妙的穷办法，就是因为我们有这种革命精神和勇气。贾仲高能够在一个一无所有、看来是很难办起学校的地方，用穷办法办起了学校，也是因为他有这种革命精神和勇气。可见，蕴藏在穷办法里面的灵魂、精髓，恰恰是无产阶级的彻底的革命精神，这种革命精神比任何现成的物质条件要强得多，它可以把天大的困难踩倒、踏碎。而这种精神，只有在共产党领导下的有觉悟的人民才能具备。
    贾仲高办起一所小学校，看来并不是一件多么了不起的不平凡的事情，但是，他的工作精神的确是不平凡的。做工作就像挑担子，“担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。”（“毛泽东选集”第四卷第1160页）贾仲高就是有这种共产主义者的精神，因而我们要向他学习。
