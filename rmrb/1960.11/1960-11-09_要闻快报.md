    News in Brief

    On-site Visits Are a Good Way to Educate Employees
    The Shentou Coking Plant in Boshan District, Zibo City, Shandong Province, organized employees to visit coal mines in batches to observe coal production, using facts to educate workers to establish the idea of "cherishing coal as we cherish grain." They adopted methods such as observing the coal production process, engaging in production labor with coal miners, and comparing the difficulty of coal production with the plant's waste, deepening employees' understanding of coal conservation and powerfully promoting the coking plant's production increase and economy campaign. Currently, the coal consumption per ton of coke produced by this plant has decreased by more than 10% compared to the past, and the quality of coke has also improved.

    Fiercely Fight Annihilation Battles and Continuously Break Through Key Production Problems
    The General Party Branch of the Casting Workshop of the Jinxi Machine Factory in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, studied and applied Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles. In the technical revolution movement, they changed the working method of "grasping everything at once" and, targeting the technical keys in production, organized technical professional teams, concentrated superior forces, and broke through them one by one. In just over ten days, they successively broke through twenty-three major production bottlenecks that had not been resolved for a long time, which not only greatly improved product quality but also ensured the timely or advanced supply of castings to fraternal workshops.

    Science and Technology Departments Help Steel Plants Break Through Technical Barriers
    The Shanghai Yangpu District Science and Technology Popularization Association closely cooperated with the steel production increase competition movement, organizing experienced workshop leading cadres, technicians, and workers to form steelmaking and cast steel professional groups, going deep into the grassroots to help "small-scale foreign" steelmaking units solve key production techniques. Since September, they have conducted nearly ten technical experience exchanges and technical lectures on electric furnaces, converters, and cast steel, helping many steelmaking units solve key production techniques, playing a positive role in improving furnace life and increasing steel production, and also promoting the development of mass science and technology activities.

    Greater Khingan Mountains Forest Area Accelerates Timber Transportation
    The loaders at the thirty-seven timber yards in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area, China's important timber production base, worked around the clock to rush to load and transport timber to support national production and construction. In October, an average of one train car of timber was allocated every six minutes. To complete the timber transportation plan ahead of schedule, the loaders in each timber yard vigorously carried out technical innovation and technical revolution, making the loading operation basically mechanized and semi-mechanized, greatly accelerating the loading speed. Currently, the Kuduer, Xiniqi, Keyihe, and Mianduhe Forestry Bureaus have all completed their annual timber allocation plans ahead of schedule.

    Changzhou Textile Factories Cooperate to Produce Major Products
    Thirty-eight textile industrial factories in Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province, formed "four dragons" from spinning and weaving to printing and dyeing, focusing on the four major products with the largest production tasks and best-selling nationwide: corduroy, rainproof khaki, printed cloth, and silk. Each "dragon" established a professional leadership organization, unified planning and management of production, and implemented specialized cotton, spinning, weaving, and dyeing for specialized products, working together and promoting each other, further strengthening the overall concept of each factory being fully responsible for the product, improving product quality, and increasing more than one hundred new varieties of designs and colors.

    Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory Launches "All-Rounder" Movement
    Workers at the Xiangfan Cotton Textile Factory in Hubei Province launched an "all-rounder" movement, guiding employees to develop in the direction of being proficient in one major and capable in many fields, so that the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily could be better implemented. A new atmosphere of "doing whatever work is available, managing whatever affairs arise, catching up with whatever is advanced, and opposing whatever is wasteful" has been formed throughout the factory. The purpose of the "all-rounder" movement is to cultivate workers into versatile people. Currently, among the factory's more than four hundred workers, more than eighty have mastered multiple skills. They have refurbished one hundred and sixteen discarded looms to make them look brand new, and have self-made more than fifty wooden machines of various types such as yarn doubling, guide tubes, and weft beating, powerfully promoting the development of production.

    Benxi Coal Mine Persists in the System of Delivering Meals Underground
    Coal mines in the Benxi mining area of Liaoning Province persisted in implementing the system of delivering meals underground and continuously improved the quality of meals and management system, which was greatly welcomed by miners. Delivering meals underground changed the miners' traditional eating habit of two meals a day, allowing them to eat three hot meals a day like those working on the ground, ensuring the regularity of miners' diets, improving their health, and effectively promoting production. A poem is widely circulated in various coal mines in Benxi: Hot and fragrant meals delivered underground, miners feel warm in their hearts after eating, the Party's kindness will never be forgotten, mine a few more tons of industrial grain.

    Living Service Work Reaches the Forefront of Steel Production
    The Women's Federation of Wuhu City, Anhui Province, brought living welfare work to the forefront of steel production. Recently, they organized street women from the Beijing Road Branch of the Xinwu Commune to set up a "Steel Construction Site Living Service Station" at the Qunli Iron Smelting Plant to help employees with laundry, sewing, altering cotton clothes, buying daily necessities, and arranging household chores, which was very popular among employees.
