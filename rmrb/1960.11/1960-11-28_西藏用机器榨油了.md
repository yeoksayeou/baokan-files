Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 26th: Tibet has begun using oil presses to extract rapeseed oil. Lhasa, Zetang, Gyantse, and Shigatse, among other places, have received their first batch of oil presses.

　　These oil presses were specially manufactured for Tibet by a machinery factory in Hunan Province. The quality of the machines is very good. In the first oil extraction test in Lhasa, the oil yield reached 42%.

　　In the past, Tibet used primitive oil extraction equipment—a large pot, a few stones, and a log. The oil yield was generally only fifteen catties per hundred catties of rapeseed.

    西藏用机器榨油了
    据新华社拉萨26日电  西藏地区开始使用榨油机榨菜籽油。拉萨、泽当、江孜、日喀则等地都有了第一批榨油机。
    这批榨油机是湖南省的一个机械制造厂专为西藏制造的，机器的质量很好，在拉萨第一次试验榨油，出油率达到42％。
    西藏过去一直使用原始的榨油设备——一口大锅、几块石头和一根木头，每百斤菜籽的出油率一般只有十五斤。
