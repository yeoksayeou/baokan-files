    Leadership Experience of a Red Small Team
    Work Team of the Rural Work Department of the Longxi Prefectural Committee of the CPC
    The Xitian Small Team is a red small team under the Neixi Brigade of the Penghua Commune in Longhai County, Fujian Province. This small team has increased production and won awards every year. The political atmosphere here is strong, the members love the collective as their home, and are full of vitality; production and life are both excellent, the work appears busy but not chaotic, and there is plenty of energy with a good balance between work and rest. This summer, it suffered a severe disaster, but the early rice yield per mu was still more than 20% higher than the average level of the entire brigade, and the summer pre-distribution increased the income of all members.
    Good Leadership Team
    The Xitian Small Team has an excellent leadership team. Of the eleven cadres above the team leader level in the entire team, nine are poor and lower-middle peasants. They are selfless, hardworking, and take the lead in bearing hardships and enjoying comforts after others.
    Take the lead in labor, sharing joys and sorrows with team members. In the first half of this year, the eleven cadres averaged 172.5 workdays each, 24.5 workdays more than laborers of equal strength, exceeding the average level of each laborer in the team by 9.1%.
    In leading labor, cadres never pick the easy tasks or avoid the difficult ones; wherever it is most difficult, they go there. In the summer, when leveling the grave soil, the cadres went to the hottest places; in the winter, when digging river mud, the cadres went to the coldest places. Under the influence of the cadres' leading labor, the team members were all vigorous and energetic, and the enthusiasm soared. From January to June, those who worked full attendance accounted for 97% of the total labor force, of which those who exceeded full attendance accounted for 30%.
    Cadres are united, and their families actively participate in labor. Of the 34 cadre family members in the entire team, except for six who were arranged in specialized teams and canteens according to work needs, the rest were sent to field operation groups; from January to June, each person averaged 151 workdays. The good labor performance of cadre family members is due to each cadre being responsible for educating their own family members; the team leader holds regular family member meetings. Cadre family members participate in the same labor, competitions, evaluations, and rewards and punishments as team members, and there are no special privileges in labor and life. Through education and regular evaluations, those who originally performed well became more active, and those who performed poorly also underwent great changes. For example, the wife of team leader Hong Rending stole a handful of wheat when threshing last year. After Hong Rending discovered it, he educated her to hand over the wheat and publicly made a self-criticism to the team members. Later, she performed well and was praised at a general meeting. Because the cadres tightly grasped the education of their family members, 24 out of the 34 family members in the entire team were rated as "Five-Good" team members. The masses said with satisfaction: "With good cadres, there are good family members; a good start is sure to have a good finish."
    Cadres care about team members. When a team member gets sick, the cadres always personally visit as soon as they receive the news, repeatedly instructing them to rest and recuperate. The sick team members are very moved, and after they recover, they are always more energetic. Female team member Cai Song injured her foot during labor and bled profusely. The cadres found elephant oil to apply to it and told her to rest well, which moved her so much that she asked to work before her injury had healed. The more the cadres care about the masses, the greater the enthusiasm of the masses. This year, the planned task for late rice transplanting was nine days, but it was completed in six days.
    Excellent Political Work
    Closely combining political work with leading production, conducting political work through production activities, and leading production well through political work, is an important leadership experience of this small team. In the production process, constantly summarize the achievements to educate the team members, summarizing after a period, summarizing after a season, making production activities the central content of political work. For example, before the summer harvest last year, there was a mobilization to accumulate fertilizer. Some team members emphasized that "there is no way to accumulate fertilizer, and the season has not yet arrived," so the cadres organized the team members to discuss "the relationship between accumulating fertilizer and increasing production." Everyone recalled that during the advanced cooperative, each mu had 80 jin of chemical fertilizer, with a yield of 800 jin, and the fertilizer investment accounted for 24.1%; now each mu has 20 jin of chemical fertilizer, with a yield of 1,190 jin, and the fertilizer investment only accounts for 4.1%. Everyone realized that accumulating more farm manure is an effective measure to increase yield and reduce costs, and improved their enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer, accumulating and transporting soil fertilizer overnight, and working hard.
    Organize labor competitions and launch the movement to learn from, catch up with, surpass, and help each other. During this year's summer planting, the Su Liangen work group and the Hong Lubing work group launched a competition. On the first day of transplanting rice seedlings, the Su group averaged 2.082 mu per laborer, and the Hong group averaged 2.056 mu per laborer; the next day, the Hong group team members were even more energetic, and as a result, they surpassed the Su group with a record of 2.127 mu. As a result of this chasing and surpassing each other, they finally created a record of 3.38 mu, and 40 pacesetters emerged.
    Through commending good people and good deeds and evaluating "Five-Good" team members, we continuously conduct socialist and communist education to the broad masses of team members. For example, on a stormy night, Su Fusheng climbed onto the roof of the team's warehouse, risking his life, and used straw to block the holes where the tiles had been blown off by the strong typhoon, protecting more than 3,000 jin of grain. The Party branch promptly used this vivid example to educate the masses, and the effect was great.
    Sound Management System
    The Xitian Small Team divides the team's labor force into four fixed field operation groups and four specialized groups (canteen, vegetable growing, animal husbandry, and cattle herding) based on residential conditions, labor strength, technical level, and backbone strength.
    In order to enable the operation groups to fully play their role, the small team implements "Five Unifications, Three Essentials, and Three Non-Interferences" for the operation groups under the conditions of obeying the brigade's unified leadership and unified management. The Five Unifications are: the small team unifies small-scale arrangements; unifies production measures; unifies the organization of labor competitions, inspections, and evaluations; unifies the organization of shock tasks and cooperation between groups; and unifies the standard of norms for various agricultural tasks. The Three Essentials are: changes in the small team's work arrangements by the operation group must be approved by the team committee; the team committee's division of labor to contract with groups must not be a substitute for the group leader, and must obey the group leader's division of labor; cooperation must be implemented at equal value. The Three Non-Interferences are: the small team does not interfere with the operation group's rational division of labor according to each person's expertise; the operation group is responsible for the management of team members' labor, and the small team does not interfere; the small team pays work points according to the quota for agricultural tasks, the operation group evaluates work and records points, and the small team does not interfere.
    In addition to the work points for shock tasks organized by the small team being paid by the small team, the remaining land preparation, planting, management, harvesting, etc., are contracted to the groups by the small team according to the norms for agricultural tasks, divided into sections and items.
    The two-year practice of the Xitian Small Team has proved that this approach has many benefits, which can not only improve the enthusiasm of the operation groups and team members, but also overcome the departmentalism of the operation groups.

    一个红色小队的领导经验
    中共龙溪地委农村工作部工作组
    溪田小队是福建龙海县蓬花公社内溪大队的一个红色小队，这个小队年年增产，年年得奖。这里的政治空气浓厚，社员爱社如家，生气勃勃；生产、生活样样出色，工作显得忙而不乱，干劲足而又劳逸结合得好。今年夏季这里遭到特大灾害，但早稻单产仍高出全大队平均水平二成以上，夏季预分使全体社员增加了收入。
    一班子好领导
    溪田小队有一班子优秀领导人物。全队小组长以上干部十一名，有九个贫农、下中农，他们大公无私，任劳任怨，吃苦在先，享乐在后。
    带头劳动，与社员同甘共苦。全队十一名干部，今年上半年平均每人做了一百七十二个半劳动日，比同等劳力多做了二十四个半劳动日，超过了全队每个劳动力平均水平的9.1％。
    干部在带头劳动中，从不拣轻避重，那里最困难，就到那里去。夏天平墓土，干部到最热的地方去；冬天挖河泥，干部到最冷的地方去。在干部带头劳动影响下，社员个个如龙似虎，干劲冲天，1至6月出满勤的占总劳动力97％，其中超满勤的占30％。
    干部团结一致，家属积极劳动。去年夏收，队长洪人丁根据天气判断下午会下阵雨，主张上午把稻捆挑回来。副队长苏海华不同意，两人各持己见。洪人丁领导的这个组按时把稻子运回来。苏海华领导的这个组却按兵不动，直到天下大雨才动手，稻子受了损失，群众一片怨声。干部从这件事认识了不团结不仅生产受损失，而且降低了领导威信，痛下决心吸取教训。从此，大家团结一致，互相尊重，共同把工作做好。大队支书洪信义对这件事体会很深，他说：“干部齐心协力，再大困难也不怕，再重任务也能完成”。
    有了好干部，也有一批好家属。全队三十四个干部家属，除了六个根据工作需要安排在专业队和食堂以外，其余都派到田间作业组去；1至6月每人平均做了一百五十一个劳动日。干部家属劳动表现好，是由于每个干部都包干教育自己的家属；小队长定期的召开家属会议。干部家属与社员同劳动、同竞赛、同评比、同奖惩，劳动、生活一律不特殊化。通过教育和定期评比，原来表现好的更加积极，表现差的也有了很大转变。例如小队长洪人丁的爱人，去年打麦时偷了一把麦子，洪人丁发现后就教育她交出麦子，并公开向社员检讨认错。后来她表现好了，还受到大会表扬。由于干部对家属教育抓得紧，全队三十四个家属中就有二十四个被评为“五好”社员。群众满意地说：“有好干部就有好家属，有好头一定有好尾”。
    干部关心社员。社员生了病，干部总是一得信就亲自登门探问，再三嘱咐安心休养。生病的社员很受感动，病好后总是干劲倍增。女社员蔡宋在劳动中脚部受伤，血流不止，干部找象油给她敷，还要她好好休息，感动得她伤未好就要求活做。干部越是关心群众，群众的干劲就越大。今年晚稻插秧任务计划九天，结果六天就插完了。
    出色的政治工作
    把政治工作和领导好生产紧密结合起来，通过生产活动进行政治工作；又通过政治工作，把生产领导好。是这个小队一条重要的领导经验。在生产过程中，不断总结成绩来教育社员，做一段，总结一段，做一季，总结一季，使生产活动成为政治工作的中心内容。例如去年夏收前发动积肥，有的社员强调“积肥无门路，季节还没到”，于是干部组织社员讨论了“积肥和增产的关系”。大家通过回忆高级社时每亩地上化肥八十斤，单产八百斤，化肥投资占24.1％；现在每亩地上化肥二十斤，单产一千一百九十斤，化肥投资只占4.1％。大家认识了多积农家肥是增加产量和减低成本的有效措施，提高了积肥积极性，连夜积土肥，赶挖赶运，大干起来。
    组织劳动竞赛，开展学、赶、比、帮运动。今年夏种，苏连根作业组与洪铝柄作业组开展竞赛，插秧第一天，苏组每个劳力平均插了二亩零八厘二，洪组每个劳力插二亩零五厘六；次日洪组社员劲更足了，结果以二亩一分二厘七的纪录赛过了苏组。这样你追我赶的结果，最后创造了三亩三分八厘的纪录，涌现了四十个标兵。
    通过表扬好人好事，评比“五好”社员，不断地向广大社员进行社会主义、共产主义教育。例如苏福生在风雨交加的深夜，奋不顾身地爬上小队仓库屋顶，用稻草把被强台风掀开了瓦片的漏洞堵住，保护了三千多斤的谷子。党支部及时通过这件生动事例教育群众，作用很大。
    健全的管理制度
    溪田小队把全队劳动力，根据居住条件、劳力强弱、技术高低、骨干力量等原则，编为四个固定田间作业组和四个专业组（食堂、种菜、畜牧、放牛）。
    为了既使作业组充分发挥作用，小队在服从大队统一领导、统一管理的条件下，对作业组实行“五统、三要、三不干涉”。五统是：小队统一小段安排；统一生产措施；统一组织劳动竞赛、检查评比；统一组织突击任务和组与组之间的协作；统一各项农活定额标准。三要是：作业组变动小队的工作安排，要经队委会批准；队委分工包组，不得包办代替，要服从组长分工；组织协作要实行等价。三不干涉是：作业组根据各人特长进行合理分工，小队不干涉；社员劳动管理由作业组负责，小队不干涉；小队付给农活定额工分，作业组评工记分，小队不干涉。
    劳动工分除了小队统一组织突击任务的工分由小队支付以外，其余整地、种、管、收等都由小队根据农活措施，分段逐项定额，包工到组。
    溪田小队二年来的实践证明，这样做好处很多，既能提高作业组和社员的积极性，又能克服作业组的本位主义。
