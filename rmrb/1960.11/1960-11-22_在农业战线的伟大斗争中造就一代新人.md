    Cultivating a New Generation in the Great Struggle on the Agricultural Front
    Hu Yaobang
    A tremendous change is taking place on the agricultural front. For several months, millions of young people, together with a large number of adults and cadres, have enthusiastically responded to the great call of the Party and Chairman Mao to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Converging from all directions, they have advanced triumphantly to the forefront of agricultural production, launching a powerful offensive on the agricultural front. This is an unprecedented and magnificent undertaking with immense strength and momentum. It signifies that a mass movement of even greater scale to build agriculture and people's communes is forming a high tide.

    Chairman Mao said: "The countryside is a vast expanse of heaven and earth where there is plenty of room for them to develop their talents to the full."① The vast number of young people see the agricultural front as a vast expanse of heaven and earth where they can contribute to the construction of socialism, establish and develop their revolutionary worldview, and receive comprehensive development and training. All young people in the country should, in this great struggle, further establish the lofty ideal of loving agriculture and the people's communes, and become a powerful shock force in building socialist agriculture and a beautiful and happy people's commune.

    Why do we say that the forefront of agricultural production is a vast expanse of heaven and earth for contributing to the construction of socialism?

    As everyone knows, the socialist society that has abolished the system of exploitation has opened up broad avenues for the continuous rise of the national economy and cultural education, and for the general prosperity of the people's lives. Under such conditions, we can vigorously develop agricultural production to provide sufficient means of livelihood and raw materials, and we can also rapidly and comprehensively develop industry, transportation, commerce, and cultural and scientific undertakings. However, any society needs to employ a considerable amount of manpower to fully develop these undertakings. If the product of each agricultural worker can only meet his own needs, or can only provide a small amount of agricultural products to society, thus only releasing a small amount of manpower for other undertakings, then the other undertakings cannot be developed or develop very slowly. Therefore, Marx said: "Agricultural labor productivity beyond the individual needs of the laborer is the basis of all societies."② The "basis of all societies" mentioned here also includes socialism and communism, of course. At present, 40% of the raw materials for all industries in China, including 80% of the raw materials for light industry, come from agriculture; the largest market for heavy industry, especially light industry, is also in the countryside; more than half of the state's financial revenue directly or indirectly relies on agriculture; and many important export commodities that can be exchanged for machinery and equipment are also agricultural products. Developing agricultural production is of particularly important significance to our country, so Chairman Mao tells us that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. We concentrate our efforts on strengthening the agricultural front, which can not only promote the continuous leap forward in agriculture, but also promote the continuous leap forward in industry and the entire national economy. The experience of our country in recent years has proved that whether socialist construction can develop at a high speed largely depends on whether agriculture can develop at a high speed. Therefore, at present, our Party has taken a series of measures to strengthen the agricultural front, further adjust the socialist relations of production in the countryside to adapt to and further promote the development of agricultural productive forces. This is a very important step in accelerating socialist construction and a central link in implementing the general line. Therefore, we say that the forefront of agricultural production is a very glorious post, a very promising post, and a post where the vast number of young people can make significant contributions to socialist construction.

    Strengthening the agricultural forefront and vigorously developing agriculture is not only the Party's current revolutionary measure, but also the Party's long-term strategic policy. Why do we say this? First of all, because China is a large country with a population of 650 million and a very weak foundation, fundamentally changing the face of agriculture in such a large country is an extremely complex, arduous, and long-term task. The idea that agricultural problems can be completely solved easily is unrealistic. Moreover, agriculture is the largest raw material sector in social production, and its business scope is extremely broad, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, including grain, cotton, oil, hemp, silk, tea, sugar, vegetables, tobacco, fruits, medicine, and miscellaneous crops. To ensure that all these aspects are fully developed and fully meet the needs of society, we cannot rely only on a small number of people to engage in management, nor can we expect to do it in a short period of time. Moreover, with the continuous growth of people's living needs and the continuous development of processing sectors, the scope of raw material production will inevitably continue to expand in all aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and more and more new raw material production sectors will inevitably be opened up. This also requires the continuous absorption of large numbers of new laborers to engage in this production. When Chairman Mao demonstrated the great prospects for the development of agriculture in our country, he pointed out to us: "Socialism has not only liberated laborers and means of production from the old society, but also liberated the vast nature that could not be utilized by the old society. The people have unlimited creativity. They can organize themselves and advance to all places and departments where they can exert their strength, advance to the depth and breadth of production, and create more and more welfare undertakings for themselves."③ This march towards nature, this march towards the depth and breadth of agriculture, and the continuous development process of social production formed by it will be endless. It can be seen from this that in a considerable period of time, the agricultural front will always need a large number of people, strong and energetic people, to persist in the struggle there.

    Since our country has not yet fully realized agricultural mechanization, and most places are still basically manual labor, the agricultural front needs a large amount of labor. Therefore, concentrating strong labor on the forefront of agricultural production is the most important revolutionary measure to ensure the development of agricultural productive forces at present. So, will the agricultural front not need so many people in the future when agriculture is mechanized? We say that under the equipment of industry, realizing mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification is of course the fundamental way out for agricultural production in our country. In recent years, the degree of agricultural mechanization in our country has been increasing year by year. By the end of this year, the vast rural areas will have 81,000 standard tractors. As Lenin said, the tractor "is the most important tool for completely destroying the old agriculture and expanding cultivated land."④ With it, things are much easier. Taking cultivated land as an example, one person can only plow three-tenths of an acre a day, and one cow can only plow three acres, while a tractor can plow 130 acres. According to the agricultural mechanization plan proposed by Chairman Mao of "small solution in four years, medium solution in seven years, and large solution in ten years," starting last year, after ten years, we can use machines on all the cultivated land that can be used by machines. At that time, if we have one million tractors, then the land that can be cultivated by machines nationwide only needs ten to fifteen days to be cultivated. We have the Party's correct line, principles, and policies, we have the valuable experience of the Great Leap Forward, and we have realized mechanization, we can greatly improve agricultural labor productivity, we can completely change the current backward situation of "500 million people eating food," and of course a large number of laborers will be released. However, even at that time, the way out for the rural labor force, except for a small part that turns to industry and other departments, is not to go to the cities, but to develop agriculture on a larger scale and march towards the depth and breadth of agriculture.

    All rural youth in our country should recognize this great future of agricultural development, recognize their glorious mission in winning great victories in agriculture, and dedicate their youth and strength to this magnificent cause. Now, many young people consciously go from cities to the countryside. Their actions not only strengthen the determination of the vast number of rural youth to struggle for agriculture for a long time, but also set an example for urban youth to continue to go to the countryside in the future. In our cities, millions of teenagers will grow into new young laborers every year. The industrial front of course needs to absorb some people, but in a long period of time in the future, the number of people engaged in agriculture will always be more than the number of people engaged in industry. Moreover, with the development of rational industrial layout and the need to fundamentally eliminate the difference between cities and villages, industry will also be more likely to be run in the countryside. Therefore, every year in the future, a large number of urban youth will go to the countryside, middle school students will go, and college students will also go. Their broadest world is in the vast countryside. Don't young people often say that they want to be loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and loyal to the general line? Going to the countryside and going to the forefront of agricultural production is one of the important manifestations of this unswerving loyalty.

    Why do we say that engaging in the great struggle to build agriculture can establish and develop the revolutionary worldview of young people?

    Revolutionary ideals are the soul of revolutionary youth. With great ideals, great material strength can be produced. Our ideal is to build our great motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. After a few years, social products will be extremely abundant, the communist ideological consciousness and moral qualities of all the people will be greatly improved, universal education will be popularized and improved, and the differences between workers and peasants, urban and rural areas, and mental and manual labor left over from the old society that still have to be preserved in the socialist period will gradually disappear. The remnants of unequal bourgeois rights that reflect these differences will also gradually disappear. The state function is only to deal with external enemy aggression, and it has no effect internally. At that time, we will further advance our socialist society to the communist era where everyone does their best and is distributed according to their needs. Communism is the highest ideal of mankind. It is under the inspiration of this ideal that tens of thousands of revolutionary pioneers in our country have fought heroically and continued to advance, promoting the progress of history and creating a new period of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country. Today, the historical mission placed before our younger generation is to inherit their cause, continue to struggle without stopping, and strive for the complete realization of communism in our country.

    To turn this great ideal into a brilliant reality, we must take action and practice. Without practice, even the best ideal is just a fantasy. Today, the most prominent task of revolutionary practice is to fully develop the revolutionary spirit and take the greatest energy to participate in the great struggle to build agriculture and people's communes. We are unifiers of knowledge and practice. A true revolutionary must be someone who has both noble revolutionary ideals and a down-to-earth pragmatic spirit, who has both great ideals and great ambitions, and combines this ambition with the current actual struggle. This is the heroic nature of the youth of the Mao Zedong era, and this is the vivid embodiment of the proletarian worldview.

    Agriculture accounts for a large proportion of the national economy in our country, and farmers account for more than 80% of the population of our country. This is a prominent and important feature of our society. Our Party and Chairman Mao have always emphasized that the peasant problem is the basic problem of the Chinese revolution and construction. Therefore, every Chinese revolutionary youth, if he is not familiar with the problems of the peasants, does not conduct detailed investigations and research on the situation in the countryside, and does not personally participate in the struggle to transform rural society, it is impossible to specifically and deeply understand the essence of Chinese social reality, understand the objective laws of the development of the Chinese revolution and construction, and naturally it is impossible to correctly solve the problem of the revolutionary worldview. At the same time, because agricultural construction is particularly complex and there are many contradictions, we need to constantly transform and struggle. And after people have experienced a struggle, they will be familiar with an objective thing or one aspect of the thing. After another practice, people will be familiar with another objective thing or another aspect of the thing. Such continuous practice will gradually familiarize themselves with all aspects of the thing, so as to grasp the law of development of objective things, exercise their position faster and better, expand their cognitive ability to a greater extent, and enhance their belief in engaging in more arduous struggles. Advanced young people such as Xing Yanzi, Zhang Xiumin, Wan Bingyan, and Song Ximing, who are familiar to everyone, have enriched their revolutionary ideals and improved their ability to change reality in repeated practice with their heroic actions, and have made valuable contributions to the cause of socialist construction in the countryside. Thousands of backbone members in the revolutionary ranks have also been trained in this way. They have not simply transformed their subjective world from books, but from the practice of transforming the objective world, laying the foundation for the revolutionary worldview and training themselves to become strong Marxist fighters with rich combat experience. We young people should all take this path.

    Throwing oneself into the fiery struggle on the agricultural front can also enhance the mass viewpoint and collectivist revolutionary qualities of young people. Building agriculture and people's communes is a noble cause that benefits the peasants, benefits all the people, and benefits future generations. What does a revolutionary live in the world for? It is to fight for the benefit of the people and the benefit of society throughout his life. Today, building agriculture is an urgent and important task facing the Party and the people. Millions of people and young people, under the unified command of the Party, are gathered on the forefront of agricultural production. This action itself shows that our young people have closely tied their destiny to the greatest and most long-term interests of the 500 million farmers and all the people. This is a great collectivist action. Here, every construction we carry out and every struggle we launch will add material wealth to the people's commune and deepen our flesh-and-blood connection with the people's commune. Here, we live and work with the vast number of farmers day and night, share weal and woe, produce together, and fight together, and we will constantly be influenced by the excellent qualities of the working people, so that our thoughts and emotions will be integrated with the thoughts and emotions of the vast number of farmers, care about the lives of the masses, and be enthusiastic about public undertakings. All these will cultivate and enhance the youth's deep feelings for loving the people's communes and loving agriculture, and promote the greater upsurge of the youth's communist spirit.

    The agricultural front is a relatively arduous front, and on this front, it is also the most able to temper the young people's perseverance in the revolution and cultivate the young people's spirit of hard struggle in the revolution. In the process of building agriculture, we must carry out many arduous labors. For example, we must transform barren beaches into fertile fields, open up mountains and ridges, and green the earth. We must transform this place well and then transform another place. In these transformations, we will often encounter stubborn resistance from old things. But the heroes of Liangshan were all forced to go up the mountain, and revolutionary skills were all fought out. In the labor of transforming nature, people must clear the way forward, strive for their own initiative, and must meet one difficulty after another and overthrow one obstacle after another. It is through such struggles that the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, the heroic spirit of never giving up until the goal is achieved, and the ambition to conquer the earth and build a strong country can be most stimulated. This spirit of hard struggle is the family heirloom of our revolutionary cause. Our Party is a party that has been tempered into steel through hard struggle, and our revolutionary history is a history of hard struggle. In the past revolutionary struggles, the revolutionary spirit of perseverance, heroism, tenacity, and hard struggle that the revolutionary people have developed in the struggle against difficulties will always shine with brilliant light. Chairman Mao tells us that any country, any society, any revolutionary historical stage will have difficulties, only the nature is different. Compared with the past, the current hardships are much smaller, but all kinds of difficulties still exist. Today, we must further develop the revolutionary fine traditions, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, work hard, rely on our own efforts, and accelerate socialist construction. In the eyes of the liberated and revolutionary Chinese people and youth, any difficulty is just a paper tiger and can be defeated. As everyone knows, in the past two years, we have continuously resisted the largest natural disasters that our country has encountered since the 20th century. We will also ride the wind and waves and achieve more and greater victories on the agricultural front. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world."⑤

    People often discuss such a question: In a country where the revolution has won, is it better to let people experience more hardship and training in their youth, or to enjoy more happiness? Which is more conducive to the healthy growth of young people? We say that the establishment of the socialist system has created superior conditions for the spiritual and material life of young people in our country. The young people are happy. But we cannot be satisfied with this, and we must continue to struggle to build a better and happier tomorrow. The hardship we are talking about includes the spirit of struggle under relatively difficult natural and material conditions, but it is not limited to this aspect. There is another aspect, that is, under better conditions, we must also undertake arduous tasks, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and always maintain the style of hard work and simplicity. The revolutionary pioneers were all like this. They not only cut through thorns and broke the shackles of the old society, opening up a bright road for future generations and promoting the development of history, but also created the most valuable spiritual wealth, inspiring the fighting spirit of the masses and illuminating the road for future generations. So here, whether or not to dare to bring young people into the most arduous struggle to train and grow is an important sign of whether or not to dare to guide young people to carry out the revolution to the end. If we do not establish a revolutionary worldview, do not conduct revolutionary ideological education, but only talk about material enjoyment, eating, drinking, and having fun, we can only wear away the fighting spirit of young people, disintegrate the morale of young people, and create a group of decadent loafers and cowards. In this way, the revolution will definitely stop because of this. We must always remember that the Chinese revolution is great, and there is still a long way to go in the future, and there is still a very arduous work to be done by us. We must also always remember that there are still many class brothers and sisters in the world suffering. We must always maintain the spirit of hard struggle and fight to the end for the revolutionary cause.

    The transformation of the objective world is endless, so the transformation of the subjective world is also endless. In the struggle to build agriculture, every time we overcome a difficulty in the way forward, we will redouble our fighting spirit and courage to move forward, and every time we climb a peak of victory, we will redouble our experience and ability to build. Through hard struggle, every time we achieve a great victory, the revolutionary and construction cause will develop a step, history will move forward a step, and people's spiritual outlook will also improve a step. Developing in this cycle, the more struggles, the more history moves forward, and the more people's thoughts are improved. With the continuous victory of agricultural construction and the entire socialist construction cause in our country, a generation of youth with communist revolutionary ideals, with collectivist spiritual qualities, who can undertake arduous revolutionary tasks and can persist in fighting to the end, will gradually grow up.

    Why do we say that the great struggle to build agriculture is a vast expanse of heaven and earth for training young people to develop in an all-round way?

    We know that the proletarian revolutionary teachers have always regarded young people as the future of the revolution and as the successors of the great cause of communism, hoping that young people will grow into a new generation of all-round development. Our Party and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao have given infinite care to Chinese youth, and have repeatedly instructed Chinese youth to have a firm and unwavering proletarian thorough revolutionary worldview, to have the knowledge, talent, and ability to engage in class struggle and production struggle, and to have the strong physique required to achieve these struggle tasks. This is the requirement for the all-round development of young people.

    In the past revolutionary battles against domestic and foreign enemies, thousands of young people in our country were trained into loyal and brave class fighters, and heroic figures such as Liu Hulan, Wang Xiaohe, Ding Youjun, and Huang Jiguang emerged. In the transitional period from capitalism to communism, class struggle will continue to exist in our country at a high and low level. In the countryside, there are still the overthrown exploiting classes. The worldview of the exploiting classes, the political influence and habits of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, and the influence of old habits all clash with socialism, forming a struggle between two roads and two lines. As for the struggle between the advanced and backward, correct and wrong ideas among the masses of the people, it will exist on a large scale, universally, and for a long time. Our vast number of young people can better learn the Party's policies and learn the methods of class analysis on the agricultural front, and be educated and trained from actively participating in these actual struggles, so that they can become the most active fighters who correctly implement the Party's policies. At the same time, we must never forget that internationally, there are still very sharp and complex struggles between the vast working people of the world and imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism. Young people in our country must earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works, master the laws of class struggle, improve their fighting skills, and firmly stand at the forefront of class struggle. This is a very important aspect of cultivating oneself into a new person with all-round development.

    On the other hand, agricultural production is very broad and complex, and on this front, it is also the most able to enrich the knowledge of young people in production struggles and improve the ability of young people in production struggles. For example, we must implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" under various different natural conditions, and we must fight against the soil and fight against natural disasters such as water, drought, diseases, and insects. There is a lot of knowledge in this. We must master the intricate growth laws of various crops and livestock, explore the secrets of high yields in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and apply many modern scientific knowledge to agricultural production. We must manage the sky, the earth, the mountains, the water, the plants, and the animals. So many projects and so rich content are the best classroom for young people to acquire living knowledge and living experience, and are also an important factor in promoting the all-round growth of young people. There was once a argument that there is nothing to learn from dealing with mud all day long in the countryside, which is obviously wrong.

    Of course, such rich agricultural production knowledge and experience will not be obtained easily. To obtain it, we must drill into agricultural production, study hard, and study tenaciously. We should combine book knowledge and practical knowledge well, and focus on learning in production practice. Practice produces truth. All great natural science and agricultural science theories are summarized from repeated practice; all accomplished natural scientists and agricultural experts are trained from hard mental and physical labor. In recent years, especially since the Great Leap Forward, many local experts who have made great achievements have emerged among young people in our country. Wang Baojing, who is famous for creating high yields of corn, young breeders Zhou Hanhua and Deng Yantang, Nie Shoumao, who successfully cultivated insect-resistant cotton, and local pesticide expert Yuan Zhenying are all excellent representatives. They were originally ordinary farmers with low levels of education, but because they worked hard, combined production with serious research, and were unyielding in the face of repeated failures, they finally created outstanding achievements from production struggles. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, as long as the vast number of young people work hard on the agricultural production front, inherit and develop the rich experience in agricultural production accumulated by our great motherland for thousands of years, and make full use of the natural conditions for developing agriculture in our country, after a few years, more great creations in agricultural science will definitely emerge from our generation, and countless outstanding agricultural scientists, breeders, horticulturalists, pest and disease scientists, and experts in forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and other fields will be produced. These people are new types of scientific and technical experts armed with modern science and our country's rich agricultural production experience, and they will definitely be able to do many things that predecessors could not do.

    Directly engaging in production practice is also of great significance for eliminating the difference between mental and manual labor. We know that engaging in agricultural production under the current conditions is mainly manual labor. Without this hard manual labor, it is impossible to change the backwardness of agricultural production. Manual labor is the fundamental condition for human survival and development, and it cannot be eliminated in 10,000 years. Today, we go to the agricultural front, we can study in our spare time while working to improve our scientific and technological and cultural level. We should cultivate ourselves into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture through such a path. As long as we seriously follow the instructions of the Party and advance simultaneously in terms of both labor and knowledge, after a few years, the fundamental difference between mental and manual labor will gradually disappear, and this generation of young people will become a new type of laborer.

    A new large-scale battle to conquer nature on the agricultural front has begun. Under the leadership of the Party, 650 million people in our country are creating a new era in human history in which agricultural production shines brightly. We are today on the eve of this great victory. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, the struggle is arduous, and there are still difficulties on the road to victory. However, any pessimistic assessment of the future of agriculture is short-sighted, and frowning at temporary difficulties will surely be ridiculed by history. We must look at problems, as Chairman Mao taught us, be good at seeing the distant future from the sprouts of new things, and grasp their essence by seeing through the surface of things. As early as the Jinggangshan period, when the red regime was under repeated attacks by powerful counter-revolutionary armed forces, Chairman Mao wisely foresaw that the high tide of the Chinese revolution would come like "a round of rising sun spurting out of the horizon."⑥ As early as the very difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao pointed out with foresight: "The mast of the ship of the New China has already emerged from the horizon."⑦ As early as when the Third Revolutionary Civil War was in full swing, Chairman Mao told the people of the whole country with full confidence, "The dawn is ahead, and we should work hard."⑧ Today, we have the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have the people's commune, the best organizational form for promoting the continuous development of agricultural production, we have the support of the increasingly powerful socialist industrialization, and we have millions of people bravely going to the forefront of agricultural production to fight. The continuous leap forward and great victory of Chinese agriculture is already in our hands.

    The overall situation at present is very good. Young people, let us, together with the broad masses, set off a new upsurge in agricultural production, strive to produce more grain in 1961, and achieve a bumper harvest; strive for the next few years, for example, six or seven years in a row, to achieve bumper harvests of grain and various crops. Strive for a better and greater victory for the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's commune, and bravely advance for the great victory of Chinese agriculture!

    在农业战线的伟大斗争中造就一代新人
    胡耀邦
    一个巨大的变化正在农业战线上发生。几个月来，千百万青年同大批成年人、大批干部，热烈响应党和毛主席的大办农业、大办粮食的伟大号召，从各个方面汇集起来，高歌猛进，奔赴农业生产第一线，在农业战线上展开了强大的进攻。这是一次力量雄厚、声势浩大的空前壮举。它标志着一场更大规模的建设农业、建设人民公社的群众运动，正在形成高潮。
    毛主席说：“农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”①广大青年正是把农业战线看作是为建设社会主义贡献力量的广阔天地，是确立和发展自己的革命世界观的广阔天地，是使自己受到全面发展的锻炼的广阔天地。全国青年都应当在这场伟大的斗争中，进一步树立起热爱农业、热爱人民公社的崇高思想，成为建设社会主义农业、建设美好幸福的人民公社的一支强大的突击力量。
    为什么说，农业生产第一线是为建设社会主义贡献力量的广阔天地呢？
    大家知道，废除了剥削制度的社会主义社会，给国民经济和文化教育的不断高涨，给人民生活的普遍富裕开辟了广阔的途径。在这种条件下，我们可以大力地发展农业生产以提供充足的生活资料和原料，还可以迅速地全面地发展工业、交通、商业和文化科学事业。而任何一个社会，要全面发展这些事业，都需要占用相当数量的人力。如果每一个农业人口的生产品，只能满足他自己的需要，或者只能向社会提供少量的农产品，从而只能腾出较少的人力从事其他事业，那末，其他的事业就不可能发展或者发展得很慢。因此，马克思说：“超越于劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会的基础。”②这里所说的“一切社会的基础”，当然也包括社会主义和共产主义。当前我国全部工业40％的原料，其中轻工业80％的原料来自农业；重工业、尤其是轻工业的最广大的市场也在农村；国家财政收入的一半以上直接间接地要靠农业；许多可以换回机器设备的重要出口商品，也是农产品。发展农业生产对于我国有着特殊重要的意义，所以毛主席告诉我们，农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础。我们集中力量加强农业战线，不仅能够促进农业的持续跃进，而且能够推动工业和整个国民经济的持续跃进。几年来我国的经验证明，社会主义建设能不能高速度地发展，在很大程度上就决定于农业能不能高速度地发展。因此，在当前，我们党采取了一系列的措施来加强农业战线，进一步调整农村中社会主义生产关系，使之适应并更大地促进农业生产力的发展。这是加速社会主义建设的一个十分重要的步骤，是贯彻总路线的一个中心环节。因此我们说，农业生产第一线是一个非常光荣的岗位，非常有出息的岗位，是广大青年能够为社会主义建设作出重大贡献的岗位。
    加强农业第一线，大办农业，不仅是党的当前的革命措施，而且是党的长期的战略方针。为什么这样说呢？这首先是因为，中国是一个拥有六亿五千万人口、而底子又十分薄弱的大国，在这样一个大国里，要根本改变农业面貌，是一个极端复杂、艰巨而长期的任务。那种认为轻易就可以彻底解决农业问题的想法，是不切实际的。而且农业在社会生产中是一个最广大的原料部门，它所经营的范围极其广阔，包括了农、林、牧、副、渔，包括了粮、棉、油、麻、丝、茶、糖、菜、烟、果、药、杂等许多方面。要使这些方面都得到全面发展，充分满足社会的需要，就不能只靠少数人力从事经营，也不能指望在短时期内就可以办到。何况，随着人民生活需要的不断增长和加工部门的不断发展，在农、林、牧、副、渔各个方面，原料生产的范围必将不断地扩大，越来越多的新的原料生产部门必将不断地开辟出来。这也就需要不断地吸收大批新的劳动力，从事这种生产。毛主席在论证我国农业发展的伟大前景的时候，就向我们指出：“社会主义不仅从旧社会解放了劳动者和生产资料，也解放了旧社会所无法利用的广大的自然界。人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”③这种向大自然的进军，这种向农业的深度和广度的进军，以及由此而形成的社会生产的不断发展的过程，将是无尽无休的。由此可见，在相当长的时间内，农业战线总是需要着大量的人，精强力壮的人，在那里坚持奋斗。
    由于我国目前还没有全面实现农业机械化，大部分地方基本上还是手工劳动，农业战线需要大量的劳动力，因而把强劳动力集中到农业生产第一线去，是当前保证发展农业生产力的头等重要的革命措施。那末，在将来农业实现了机械化，农业战线是不是就不需要那么多人了呢？我们说，在工业的装备下，实现机械化、水利化和电气化，当然是我国农业生产的根本出路。几年来，我国农业的机械化程度已在逐年提高，到今年年底，广大农村就将拥有八万一千个标准台拖拉机。正像列宁所说的，拖拉机“是彻底摧毁旧农业和扩大耕地的最重要的工具。”④有了它，事情就好办多了。以耕地为例，一个人一天只能翻三分，一条牛只能翻三亩，而一台拖拉机就能翻一百三十亩。按照毛主席提出的“四年小解决、七年中解决、十年大解决”的农业机械化规划，从去年起，经过十年，我们就可以在整个耕地面积上，凡是能够使用上机器的都使用上机器。到那个时候，如果有了一百万台拖拉机，那末，全国能够机耕的土地只需要十天到十五天，就可以耕完。我们有了党的正确的路线、方针和政策，有了大跃进的宝贵经验，而又实现了机械化，我们就能够极大地提高农业劳动生产率，就能够彻底改变现在的“五亿人口搞饭吃”的落后局面，当然会腾出大批的劳动力来。但是，就是到了那个时候，农村的劳动力，除一小部分转向工业和其他部门外，大部分人的出路，也不是到城里去，而是在更大的规模上去发展农业，向农业的深度和广度进军。
    我国全体农村青年都应当认清农业发展的这一伟大前途，认清自己在夺取农业伟大胜利中的光荣使命，把自己的青春和
  力量献给这个壮丽的事业。现在，许许多多青年自觉地从城市走向农村，他们的行动不仅坚定了广大农村青年长久地为农业奋斗的意志，而且为今后城市青年继续走向农村作出了样子。在我国城市里，每年都将有几百万少年成长为新的青年劳动力，工业战线当然要吸收一部分人，但是在今后一个长时期内，搞农业的人总是要比搞工业的多。而且，随着工业合理布局的发展和从根本上消灭城市与乡村差别的需要，工业也是更多地要到农村里去办。所以今后每年都要有大批城市青年到农村去，中学生要去，大学生也要去，他们的最广阔的天地，在广大的农村。青年们不是常常讲，要忠于党，忠于人民，忠于总路线吗？到农村去，到农业生产第一线去，就是这种耿耿忠心的重要表现之一。
    为什么说，从事建设农业的伟大斗争能够确立和发展青年的革命的世界观呢？
    革命的理想是革命青年的灵魂。有了伟大的理想，就能产生伟大的物质力量。我们的理想就是把伟大的祖国建成具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国，经过若干年后，社会产品极大地丰富了，全体人民的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质极大地提高了，全民教育普及并且提高了，社会主义时期还不得不保存的旧社会遗留下来的工农差别、城乡差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，都逐步地消失了，反映这些差别的不平等的资产阶级法权的残余，也逐步地消失了，国家职能只是为了对付外部敌人的侵略，对内已经不起作用了，在那个时候，进一步地把我们的社会主义社会推进到各尽所能、按需分配的共产主义时代。共产主义是人类最高的理想，正是在这个理想的鼓舞下，我国成千成万的革命先驱，英勇奋斗，前仆后继，推动了历史的前进，开创了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新时期。今天，摆在我们年轻一代面前的历史使命，就是继承他们的事业，不停顿地奋斗下去，争取共产主义在我国彻底实现。
    要把这个伟大的理想变成光辉的现实，就要行动，就要实践。没有实践，再好的理想也只是空想。在今天，革命实践的最突出的任务，就是要充分发扬革命精神，拿出最大的干劲，来参加建设农业、建设人民公社的伟大斗争。我们是认识和实践的统一论者。一个真正的革命者，必然是一个既有高尚的革命理想，又有脚踏实地的实干精神，既有伟大的理想、伟大的抱负，又把这种雄心壮志同当前的实际斗争结合起来的人。这是毛泽东时代青年的英雄本色，这是无产阶级世界观的生动体现。
    农业在我国国民经济中占很大的比重，农民占我国人口的80％以上，这是我国社会的一个突出而重要的特点。我们的党和毛主席历来强调农民问题是中国革命和建设的基本问题。因此，每一个中国的革命青年，如果不熟悉农民的问题，不详细调查和研究农村的情况，不亲身参与到改造农村社会的斗争中去，也就不可能具体而深刻地认识中国社会现实的本质，认识中国革命和建设发展的客观规律，自然也就不可能正确解决革命世界观的问题。同时，由于农业建设特别复杂，各种矛盾很多，这就需要我们进行不断地改造，不断地斗争。而人们经历过一场斗争，就会熟悉一个客观事物或事物的一个侧面，经过再一次的实践，人们又会熟悉另一个客观事物或事物的另一个侧面，这样不断地实践，就会逐渐熟悉事物的各个侧面，从而掌握住客观事物的发展规律，更快更好地锻炼自己的立场，更大地扩展自己的认识能力，增强从事更艰巨的斗争的信念。像大家所熟知的邢燕子、张秀敏、万炳炎、宋喜明等先进青年，都是用他们英勇豪迈的行动，在反复实践中，丰富了革命理想，提高了变革现实的本领，在农村社会主义建设事业中做出了可贵的贡献。革命队伍里的千千万万的骨干分子也都是这样锻炼出来的，他们不是简单地从书本上，而是从改造客观世界的实践中改造了自己的主观世界，奠定了革命的世界观，锻炼成为具有丰富斗争经验的马克思主义的坚强战士。我们青年都应当走这条道路。
    投身到农业战线的火热斗争中，还可以增强青年的群众观点和集体主义的革命品质。建设农业、建设人民公社，是一个造福农民、造福全体人民、造福后代子孙的崇高事业。一个革命者活在世界上为了什么？就是为了造福人民，造福社会而战斗终生。今天，建设农业是党和人民所面临的一项迫切而重要的任务，千百万人民和青年在党的统一指挥下，集结到农业生产第一线来，这个行动本身就表明我们青年把自己的命运同五亿农民和全体人民的最大最长远的利益，紧紧地拴在了一起。这是一个伟大的集体主义的行动。在这里，我们所进行的每一个建设、所开展的每一个斗争，都会为人民公社增添物质财富，都会加深我们对人民公社的血肉联系。在这里，我们和广大农民朝夕相处，同甘共苦，一道生产，一同战斗，就会不断地受到劳动人民的优秀品质的熏陶，使自己的思想情绪同广大农民的思想情绪打成一片，关心群众的生活，热心于公共事业。所有这些，都会培养和增强青年热爱人民公社、热爱农业的深厚感情，促进青年共产主义精神的更大高涨。
    农业战线是一条比较艰苦的战线，在这条战线上，又最能磨炼青年坚韧不拔的革命毅力，培养青年艰苦奋斗的革命精神。在建设农业的过程中，要进行许多艰苦的劳动，比如，我们要把荒滩改造成良田，要辟山开岭，绿化大地，要把这个地方改造好了，再去改造另外的地方，而在这些改造中，又时常会遇到旧事物的顽强抵抗。但是梁山的好汉都是逼上去的，革命的本领都是斗争出来的。在改造大自然的劳动中，人们要打通前进的道路，争取自己的主动权，就必须迎击一个又一个的困难，打倒一个又一个的障碍。正是通过这样的斗争，才最能激发人们敢于斗争敢于胜利的革命精神，不达目的誓不罢休的英雄气概和战胜地球建立强国的雄心壮志。这种艰苦奋斗的精神，是我们革命事业的传家宝。我们的党就是一个从艰苦斗争中百炼成钢的党，我们的革命历史就是一部艰苦奋斗的历史。在过去的革命斗争中，革命人民在同困难斗争中所锻炼出来的百折不回，英勇顽强，艰苦奋斗的革命精神，将永远闪耀着灿烂的光辉。毛主席告诉我们，任何一个国家，任何一个社会，任何一个革命历史阶段，都是会有困难的，只是性质不同。和过去相比，现在的艰难困苦是小得多了，但是各种各样的困难还是存在的。今天，我们更要发扬革命的优良传统，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，埋头苦干，自力更生，加速社会主义建设。在解放了的、充满革命精神的中国人民和青年看来，任何困难都不过是纸老虎，都是可以打倒的。人所共知，最近两年，我们就连续地抗御了二十世纪以来我国所遇到的最大的自然灾害。我们还将乘风破浪，在农业战线上取得更多更伟大的胜利。正像毛主席指出的，“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”⑤
    人们时常议论这样一个问题：在一个革命胜利了的国家里，究竟让人们在青年时代多经受些艰苦锻炼好呢，还是多享些福好呢？怎样更有利于青年的健康成长呢？我们说，社会主义制度的建立，在精神生活和物质生活方面都为我国青年创造了优越的条件。青年们是幸福的。但是我们不能以此为满足，还要继续奋斗，建设更美好更幸福的明天。我们所说的艰苦，包括了在比较困难的自然条件和物质条件下的那种奋斗精神，但是并不限于这一面，还有另外一面，这就是在较好的条件下，同样要承担艰巨的任务，要发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，永远保持艰苦朴素的作风。革命的先驱者们都是这样的，他们不仅披荆斩棘，打烂了旧社会的枷锁，为后代开辟了光明大道，推动了历史的发展，而且他们创造了最可宝贵的精神财富，鼓舞着广大群众的斗志，照亮了后人前进的道路。所以在这里，敢不敢把青年带到最艰苦的斗争中去锻炼成长，是敢不敢引导青年把革命进行到底的重要标志。如果不确立革命世界观，不进行革命的思想教育，而只讲物质享受，吃喝玩乐，就只能消磨青年的斗志，瓦解青年的士气，造就出一批萎靡不振的懒汉和懦夫。这样，革命一定会由此而停顿下来。我们时刻都要记着，中国革命是伟大的，今后还有很长的路程，还有很艰巨的工作要我们去做。我们也时刻都要记着，世界上还有很多阶级弟兄在受痛苦。我们一定要永远保持艰苦奋斗的精神，为革命事业战斗到底。
    客观世界的改造是没有止境的，因此主观世界的改造也是没有止境的。在建设农业的斗争中，我们每战胜前进中的一个困难，就会加倍地增强我们前进的斗志和勇气，每攀登一个胜利的高峰，就会加倍地丰富我们建设的经验和本领。经过艰苦奋斗，每取得一个巨大胜利，革命和建设事业就发展一步，历史就前进一步，人们的精神面貌也就提高了一步。由此循环发展，经过斗争越多，历史越往前进，人们的思想也越提高。随着我国农业建设和整个社会主义建设事业的不断胜利，一代具有共产主义革命理想的、具有集体主义精神品质的、能够承担艰巨革命任务又能坚持斗争到底的青年，就会逐步成长起来。
    为什么说，建设农业的伟大斗争是锻炼青年全面发展的广阔天地呢？
    我们知道，无产阶级的革命导师从来都把青年看作革命的未来，看作是共产主义伟大事业的继承者，希望青年成长为全面发展的一代新人。我们的党和我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席对中国青年更给予了无限的关怀，一再地指示我国青年要具有坚定不移的无产阶级彻底革命的世界观，具有从事阶级斗争和生产斗争的知识、才能和本领，具有实现这些斗争任务所需要的健壮的体质。这就是对于青年的全面发展的要求。
    在过去反对国内外敌人的革命战斗中，我国千千万万的青年锻炼成了忠诚勇敢的阶级战士，涌现了像刘胡兰、王孝和、丁佑君、黄继光这样可歌可泣的英雄人物。在由资本主义到共产主义的过渡时期中，阶级斗争在我国还会高一阵低一阵地存在下去。在农村，还存在着被打倒了的剥削阶级，剥削阶级的世界观、资产阶级和小资产阶级的政治影响和习惯势力，同社会主义相抵触，形成了两条道路、两条路线的斗争。至于人民群众中的先进与落后，正确与错误思想之间的斗争，更会大量地普遍地长期地存在。我们广大青年在农业战线上，可以更好地学习党的方针政策，学会阶级分析的方法，从积极参加这些实际斗争中受到教育和锻炼，使自己成为正确贯彻党的政策的最积极的战士。同时，我们时刻还不能忘记，在国际上，世界广大劳动人民同帝国主义、反动派、现代修正主义之间还存在
  着十分尖锐和复杂的斗争。我国青年必须认真地学习马克思列
  宁主义，学习毛主席著作，掌握阶级斗争的规律和提高斗争本领，坚决地站在阶级斗争的前列。这是把自己培养成为全面发展的新人的一个十分重要的方面。
    另一方面，农业生产是非常宽广和复杂的，在这条战线上，又最能丰富青年生产斗争的知识，提高青年生产斗争的本领。比如，我们要在各种不同的自然条件下贯彻“八字宪法”，要对土壤开战，对水、旱、病、虫等自然灾害开战，这里面就大有学问。我们要掌握各种农作物和各种牲畜的错综复杂的生长规律，要探索农、林、牧、副、渔的高产秘密，要把许许多多现代科学知识应用于农业生产，我们要管天、管地、管山、管水、管植物、管动物。这么繁多的项目，这么丰富的内容，是使青年取得活的知识，活的经验的最好的课堂，也是促进青年全面成长的重要因素。曾经有一种论调，说在农村成天跟泥巴打交道，没什么可学，这显然是错误的。
    当然，这样丰富的农业生产知识和经验，是不会唾手而得的。要取得它，必须钻到农业生产里去，刻苦地学习，顽强地学习。我们应当把书本知识和实践知识很好地结合起来，并且以在生产实践中学习为主。实践出真理，一切伟大的自然科学和农业科学学说，都是从反复的实践中总结出来的；一切有成就的自然科学家和农业专家，都是从刻苦的脑力和体力劳动中锻炼出来的，几年来，特别是大跃进以来，在我国青年中，涌现了许许多多做出重大成就的土专家。大家所熟悉的以创造玉米高产而著名的王保京，青年育种家周汉华、邓炎棠，培植抗虫棉成功的聂寿茂，土农药专家原振英等等，都是优秀的代表。他们原来都是普普通通的农民，文化水平不高，但是由于他们辛勤劳动，结合生产进行认真的钻研，而且在一次又一次的失败中百折不挠，终于从生产斗争中创造了突出的成绩。我们相信，在党的领导下，只要广大青年在农业生产战线上辛勤劳动，继承和发展伟大祖国几千年积累下来的农业生产的丰富经验，充分运用我国发展农业的自然条件，经过若干年以后，从我们这一代中，一定会出现农业科学上更伟大的创造，产生出无数杰出的农业科学家、育种学家、园艺学家、病虫害学家以及林业、渔业、牧业等各个方面的专家。这些人是用现代科学和我国丰富的农业生产经验武装起来的新型的科学技术专家，他们一定能做出许多前人所不能做出的业绩。
    直接从事生产实践，对于消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别也有着十分重要的意义。我们知道，在当前条件下从事农业生产，主要是进行体力劳动。没有这种艰苦的体力劳动，就不可能改变农业生产的落后面貌。体力劳动是人类赖以生存和发展的根本条件，是一万年也消灭不了的。我们今天到农业战线上去，可以一面劳动，一面进行业余学习，以提高我们的科学技术和文化水平。我们应当通过这样的道路，把自己培养成有社会主义觉悟和有文化的劳动者。只要我们认真按照党的指示，从劳动化和知识化两个方面同时并进，经过若干年以后，脑力劳动和体力劳动的根本差别就会逐步消失，我们这代青年就会成为新型的劳动者。
    农业战线上征服大自然的一场新的大规模战斗开始了。我国六亿五千万人民在党的领导下，正在开创一个人类历史上农业生产大放光彩的新时代。我们今天就处在这个伟大胜利的前夕。不错，如前所述，斗争是艰巨的，在争取胜利的前进道路上，还存在着困难。但是，对农业前途的任何悲观估计，都是近视的，对暂时的困难愁眉苦脸，一定要受到历史的嘲笑的。我们看问题，必须像毛主席教导的那样，善于从新生事物的幼芽，看到它远大的将来，透过事物的表面，去把握它的实质。还在井冈山时期红色政权处在强大的反革命武装连番进攻的状况下，毛主席就英明地预见到中国革命的高潮像“喷薄欲出的一轮朝日”一样就将到来⑥。还在抗日战争十分艰苦的时期毛主席就高瞻远瞩地指出：“新中国航船的桅顶已经冒出地平线了”⑦。还在第三次国内革命战争大战方酣的时候，毛主席就满怀信心地告诉全国人民，“曙光就在前面，我们应当努力。”⑧今天，我们有党和毛主席的英明领导，有人民公社这个促进农业生产不断发展的最好的组织形式，有日益强大的社会主义工业化的支持，有千百万群众英勇地到农业生产第一线上去奋斗，中国农业的持续跃进和伟大胜利，已经把握在我们手里了。
    当前的整个形势是大好的。青年们，让我们同广大群众一道，掀起一个农业生产的新高潮，力争1961年多打粮食，获得大丰收；力争以后几年，例如说，一连六、七年，使粮食和各项农作物都获得大丰收。为实现总路线、大跃进、人民公社更好更大的胜利，为实现中国农业的伟大胜利，奋勇前进！
