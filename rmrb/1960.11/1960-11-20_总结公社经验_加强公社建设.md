Summarize Commune Experiences and Strengthen Commune Construction

The rural People's Communes have now been in existence for nearly three years.

These are three great years, three victorious years. In the past three years, the vast rural People's Communes have increasingly demonstrated unparalleled superiority and strong vitality in promoting the development of rural social productive forces, comprehensively developing rural socialist undertakings, overcoming natural disasters, and promoting the rapid development of various construction undertakings in our country. The rural People's Communes have accumulated rich experience over the past three years. In order to continue the great leap forward, to build our vast rural socialist cause faster and better, and to further accelerate the pace of our country's overall socialist construction, we should carefully summarize these experiences and apply them to the future construction of the rural People's Communes. The busy "Three Autumns" work is about to be successfully concluded, and the slack winter season is approaching. We should make good use of the favorable conditions of winter leisure, extensively mobilize the masses, and conduct in-depth and meticulous work to summarize the experiences of the rural People's Communes.

The experiences of the rural People's Communes over the past three years are rich and diverse. From which aspects should we start to summarize these experiences? The entire practice of the past three years has proven that the Party's series of resolutions, guidelines, policies, and instructions on the People's Communes are the fundamental guarantee for the consolidation and sound development of the rural People's Communes. In order to run all rural People's Communes better, we should thoroughly examine the implementation of policies and use the Party's guidelines, policies, resolutions, and instructions as our weapons to summarize commune experiences and strengthen commune construction.

The first resolution of the Central Committee of the Party on the People's Communes clearly pointed out the socialist nature of the rural People's Communes at the present stage. Later, the Sixth Plenary Session Resolution, the Eighth Plenary Session Resolution, and a series of other instructions on the People's Communes further stipulated that the People's Communes should implement the principle of "differentiated management, differentiated accounting, distribution according to work, and more pay for more work" at the present stage, and clearly stipulated that at the present stage, the means of production of the communes should implement the "three-level ownership system, with ownership at the production team level being basic, ownership at the commune level being partial, and production brigades also having a small portion of ownership." The entire practice of the past three years has proven that: wherever the Party's policy is earnestly implemented, production is better, the labor enthusiasm of the masses is higher, and the commune is more consolidated and has greater superiority. Conversely, wherever this policy is not fully and earnestly implemented, or is violated, production is not so good, the enthusiasm of the masses is not so high, and the superiority of the commune cannot be fully utilized. Comrade Mao Zedong long ago taught us to earnestly implement the Party's policies, saying, "Policy is the starting point of all actual actions of a revolutionary party, and is manifested in the process and outcome of action," "Only when the Party's policies and tactics are all on the right track will the Chinese revolution be possible to win. Policy and tactics are the life of the Party, and leading comrades at all levels must pay full attention and must not be careless." To summarize the experiences of running communes over the past three years and to run the People's Communes better, we must first summarize the experience of implementing the Party's resolutions and policies related to the People's Communes, especially the experience of implementing the policy of "three-level ownership with the production team as the foundation," and further comprehensively implement the Party's policies in the process of summarizing.

The production team is the foundation of the People's Commune, and strengthening the basic ownership of the production team is the key to developing the entire production of the commune and further consolidating the People's Commune at the present stage. To strengthen the basic ownership of the production team, it is necessary to maintain the basic ownership of the production team from both the top and bottom, that is, from the commune and the production brigade. The power of production operation and management should mainly belong to the production team. The commune and the management area (called production brigade in some places), as agencies dispatched by the commune, naturally cannot give up the supervision and inspection of the production team and the guarantee of the implementation of the production plan, but they must not blindly direct production, nor can they arbitrarily interfere. The commune's production plan should be based on the production plans of the production teams and the production brigades. Of course, while we emphasize strengthening the basic ownership of the team, we should never neglect the development of the commune-owned economy. The commune-owned economy represents the great hope and great future of the People's Commune and should be actively developed. However, the commune-owned economy must be gradually developed by relying on its own economic strength, that is, mainly relying on the income of enterprises directly operated by the commune itself, state investment and loans, and a certain proportion of the public accumulation fund extracted from the production team in accordance with regulations. Only on the basis of the rapid development of the economy of the production team can the commune's public accumulation fund gradually increase, and the commune-owned economy can gradually develop. Conversely, if the economy of the production team does not develop, or is weakened instead, the commune-owned economy will lose a solid foundation for development. As the saying goes, "When the water rises, the boat floats high." Only when the production team becomes rich can the commune become rich. This is the relationship between the commune and the team. In terms of the relationship between the team and the brigade, the production team is the basic accounting unit of the commune and the unified distribution unit of the team's agricultural and sideline products. Therefore, the agricultural products and other operating income harvested by the production brigade, within the contracted production tasks, should be truthfully handed over to the production team, and the over-produced part should also be handed over in accordance with the prescribed proportion, which is the material basis for unified accounting and unified distribution. Failure to earnestly implement this will not truly strengthen the basic ownership of the production team.

Ownership is the decisive link in the relations of production, and the change in the relations of production is based on the development of productive forces. The Sixth Plenary Session Resolution clearly pointed out: "The relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces. Only when the productive forces develop to a certain state will a certain change in the relations of production be caused. This is a basic principle of Marxism." The three-level ownership system with the production team as the foundation is suitable for the nature of the current rural productive forces in our country, is adapted to the current state of development of rural productive forces in our country, and is conducive to the development of productive forces. It must be stabilized for a long period of time. When the basic team ownership is planned, step-by-step, and batch-by-batch changed to basic commune ownership in the future, that is, when each production team jointly owns modern agricultural means of production such as tractors operated by the commune and commune-run enterprises, the means of production such as draught animals and farm tools that are currently owned by the team and fixed for use in the brigade, and team-run enterprises, will not be transferred to commune ownership, but will still be owned by the team and used by the brigade. Personal means of subsistence will still be owned by individuals even in communist society.

Ownership and use rights must be clearly distinguished. The production brigade must ensure that it does not infringe on the ownership of the production team, and the production team must ensure that it does not infringe on the use rights of the production brigade. The labor force, land, draught animals, farm tools, etc. fixed for use in the production brigade cannot be arbitrarily transferred by the production team, and especially must not be transferred during a production cycle. When a transfer is needed after the end of the production cycle, it must also be discussed and decided by a certain meeting, and the brigade must be given time to prepare. It is absolutely forbidden to transfer arbitrarily without discussion, without obtaining the consent of the production brigade, and without giving the brigade time to prepare. Use rights are a matter of interpersonal relations in the relations of production. Damaging use rights hinders the development of productive forces. The right to use land is related to the right to plant crops. The right to use land has been fixed to belong to the production brigade, and the right to plant crops must be delegated to the production brigade. The production brigade carries out planting according to local conditions in accordance with the production plan of the production team.

Summarizing the experience of the past three years is, of course, not only about summarizing the experience of implementing the team-based, three-level ownership system, but also about paying attention to summarizing experiences in other aspects, such as the experience of implementing the Party's series of guidelines and policies on the People's Communes; the experience in the work style and work methods of cadres; the experience in improving and continuously improving the operation and management of the People's Communes; and the experience in comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture according to local conditions and continuously improving agricultural technology, etc. However, how to implement the Party's guidelines and policies, especially the experience of the Party's guidelines and policies on the ownership of the People's Communes, that is, the team-based commune three-level ownership policy, is the most important of these, and the People's Communes in various places should first summarize this aspect of experience. Once this aspect of experience is well summarized, it will be easier to summarize other aspects of experience.

How can we conduct the summary in order to summarize profound rather than superficial, systematic rather than piecemeal experience? How can we conduct the summary in order to turn the process of summarizing experience into a process of strengthening commune construction and further implementing the Party's policies? We believe that all cadres, especially rural work cadres, must seriously study the Party's policies, not only to seriously study the Party's specific policies on specific tasks of the People's Communes, but also to further study the Party's general line and general policies for socialist construction, and to deeply understand the relationship between the two; at the same time, on the basis of cadres' deep knowledge and understanding of the Party's guidelines and policies, deeply publicize the Party's policies to the broad masses, so that the Party's policies can directly meet with the broad masses and be mastered by the broad masses. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "Our policies must be known not only to leaders and cadres, but also to the broad masses. ...When the masses know the truth and have a common purpose, they will work together. ...When the masses are of one mind, everything will be easy. The basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is to make the masses realize their own interests and unite to fight for their own interests." When cadres understand the Party's policies and are determined to implement the Party's policies, and when the masses understand the policies and resolutely demand the realization of the Party's policies, the leadership and the masses will combine from top to bottom and from bottom to top, forming a broad and enthusiastic mass movement, and the Party's policies will be effectively implemented. The same is true for implementing policies and summarizing the experience of implementing policies. As long as we let go and mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, combine with the actual situation of our own commune and team, and deeply examine the work, we will be able to summarize the rich experience of the past three years well, and we will be able to transform the process of summarizing experience into a process of strengthening commune construction and further implementing the Party's policies, and become a process of carrying out socialist education and raising socialist awareness for the broad masses of cadres and masses. When examining the work, we must not only summarize our achievements and victories, promote successful experiences, commend good people and good deeds, establish red flags, and establish models; we must also deeply examine the shortcomings in the work, widely carry out criticism and self-criticism, analyze the causes of the shortcomings, study ways to overcome the shortcomings, and conscientiously summarize the lessons in the work. Summarizing these experiences well and conscientiously implementing these experiences into our work will make our communes run better and more consolidated, and will lay a solid and reliable foundation for us to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture next year and continue to leap forward in the future.

### 总结公社经验　加强公社建设

    总结公社经验　加强公社建设
    农村人民公社到现在已经有将近三年的历史了。
    这是伟大的三年、胜利的三年。近三年来，广大农村人民公社在促进农村社会生产力发展方面，在全面发展农村社会主义事业方面，在战胜自然灾害方面，在促进我国各项建设事业飞速发展方面，越来越发挥出无可比拟的优越性和强大生命力。将近三年来农村人民公社积累了丰富的经验。为了继续跃进，为了把我们广大农村的社会主义事业建设得更快更好，进一步加速我国整个社会主义建设步伐，我们应该很好地总结这些经验，并把这些经验运用到农村人民公社今后的建设中去。繁忙的“三秋”工作就要胜利地结束了，农事活动较少的冬季即将来临。我们应该很好地利用冬闲的有利条件，广泛地发动群众，深入细致地进行总结农村人民公社经验的工作。
    农村人民公社将近三年来的经验是丰富多采的。我们应该从哪些方面入手总结这些经验呢？近三年的全部实践证明，党的一系列的关于人民公社的决议、方针、政策和指示是使农村人民公社巩固健全地向前发展的根本保证。为了把全部农村人民公社办得更好，就应该深入检查执行政策的情形，并用党的这些方针、政策、决议和指示作为我们总结公社经验、加强公社建设的武器。
    党中央的关于人民公社的第一个决议，就明确指出了目前阶段农村人民公社的社会主义性质，以后又在六中全会决议、八中全会决议和其他一系列的关于人民公社的指示中，进一步规定人民公社在目前阶段要实行“分级管理、分级核算、按劳分配、多劳多得”的原则，并且明确规定在目前阶段公社的生产资料要实行“三级所有制，生产队一级的所有权是基本的，公社一级的所有权是部分的，而生产小队也应该有小部分的所有权”。将近三年的全部实践都已证明：哪里认真贯彻了党的这一政策，哪里的生产就搞得更好，哪里群众的劳动积极性就更高，哪里的公社就更巩固，优越性就更大。反之，哪里没有全面认真地贯彻这一政策，或违背了这一政策，哪里的生产就搞得不太好，群众的积极性就不太高，公社的优越性就不能更充分地发挥出来。毛泽东同志早就教导我们要认真贯彻党的政策，他说，“政策是革命政党一切实际行动的出发点，并且表现于行动的过程和归宿”，“只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”我们要总结将近三年来办公社的经验，要把人民公社办得更好，首先就要总结贯彻执行党的有关人民公社的决议、政策的经验，特别是总结贯彻执行“三级所有，队为基础”政策的经验，并且在总结过程中进一步地全面地贯彻党的政策。
    生产队是人民公社的基础，加强生产队的基本所有制是现阶段发展公社的整个生产和进一步巩固人民公社的关键。加强生产队的基本所有制，需要从上下两方面，即从公社方面和生产小队方面来维护生产队的基本所有制。生产经营管理的权力，应该主要归生产队。公社和作为公社派出机关的管理区
  （有的地方叫生产大队）自然不能放弃对生产队的督促检查工作和保证生产计划的执行，但是不能瞎指挥生产，也不能乱加干涉。公社的生产计划，应该建立在生产队的生产计划和生产小队的生产计划的基础上。当然，在我们强调加强队的基本所有制的时候，绝不应该忽视社有经济的发展。社有经济代表着人民公社的伟大希望和伟大前途，是应该积极地加以发展的。但是，社有经济必须是依靠自己的经济力量逐步发展起来，即主要靠公社自己直接经营的企业收入、国家的投资和贷款以及按照规定向生产队提取的一定比例的公积金发展起来。只有在生产队的经济迅速发展的基础上，公社的公积金才能逐步增加，社有经济才能够逐渐地发展起来。反之，如果生产队的经济没有发展，或者反而受到削弱，社有经济就失去坚实地发展的基础。水涨船高，生产队富了，公社才能富。这是社和队的关系。就队和小队的关系来说，生产队是公社的基本核算单位，是本队农副产品的统一分配单位，因而生产小队收获的农产品和其他经营收入，凡是在包产任务以内的，都应该如实上交给生产队，超产部分也应该按照规定的比例上交应交部分，这是统一核算、统一分配的物质基础。不认真执行这一条，也就不能真正加强生产队的基本所有制。
    所有制是生产关系的决定环节，而生产关系的变革是以生产力的发展为基础的。六中全会决议曾经明确地指出：“生产关系一定要适合生产力的性质，只有生产力发展到某种状况才会引起生产关系的某种变革，这是马克思主义的一条基本原理”。以生产队为基础的三级所有制，是适合当前我国农村生产力的性质的，是同我国当前农村生产力发展状况相适应的，是有利于发展生产力的，必须在一个长时期内稳定下来。将来有计划地、有步骤地、分期分批地变基本队有制为基本社有制的时候，也就是各个生产队共同拥有由社经营的拖拉机等现代化的农业生产资料和社办企业的时候，现在归队所有而固定在小队使用的耕畜、农具等生产资料和队营企业，也不转归社有，仍然归队所有，归小队使用。属于个人的生活资料，就是到了共产主义社会，也仍然归个人所有。
    所有权和使用权必须划分清楚，生产小队必须保证不侵犯生产队的所有权，生产队又必须保证不侵犯生产小队的使用权。固定在生产小队使用的劳动力、土地、耕畜、农具等，生产队不能随意调动，特别在一个生产周期中决不允许调动。在生产周期结束后，需要调动时，也必须经过一定会议讨论决定，并给小队以准备的时间，决不能不通过讨论，不取得生产小队的同意，不给小队以准备的时间就随便调动。使用权是生产关系中人与人的相互关系问题，破坏了使用权，也就是阻碍生产力的发展。土地的使用权是和农作物的种植权相联系的，土地的使用权已经固定归生产小队，农作物的种植权就必须下放到生产小队，生产小队是依照生产队的生产计划，进行因地制宜的种植的。
    总结近三年经验，当然不仅是总结贯彻执行队为基础、三级所有制方面的经验，还要注意总结其他方面的经验，比如贯彻执行党的关于人民公社的一系列方针政策的经验；干部的工作作风和工作方法方面的经验；改进和不断提高人民公社经营管理工作的经验；以及因地制宜全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”、不断提高农业技术等等方面的经验。但是如何贯彻党的方针政策，特别是关于人民公社所有制方面的方针政策即队为基础的公社三级所有制政策方面的经验，却是其中最重要的，各地人民公社应该首先总结这方面的经验。这方面的经验总结好了，其他方面的经验也就容易总结了。
    怎样进行总结，才能够总结出深刻的而不是肤浅的、系统的而不是零碎的经验呢？怎样进行总结，才能够把总结经验的过程变成加强公社建设的过程和进一步贯彻党的政策的过程呢？我们认为，全体干部首先是农村工作干部，要认真学习党的政策，不仅要认真学习党的关于人民公社的具体的各别工作的政策，还要进一步学习党的社会主义建设的总路线和总政策，并且深刻领会两者的相互关系；同时在干部对党的方针政策深知深解的基础上，向广大群众深入地宣传党的政策，使党的政策直接同广大群众见面，为广大群众所掌握。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“我们的政策，不光要使领导者知道，干部知道，还要使广大的群众知道。……群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做。……群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗。”干部了解了党的政策，下决心贯彻党的政策；群众了解了政策，坚决要求实现党的政策，这样就会使领导和群众由上而下和由下而上结合起来，形成广泛热烈的群众运动，党的政策便能切实有效地执行和贯彻了。贯彻政策如此，总结贯彻执行政策的经验同样如此。只要我们放手发动群众，依靠群众，结合本社、本队的实际情况，深入地检查工作，我们就能够把近三年来的丰富经验总结好，就能够变总结经验的过程为加强公社建设的过程和进一步贯彻党的政策的过程，并且成为广大干部和群众进行社会主义教育和提高社会主义觉悟的过程。在检查工作的时候，我们既要总结我们的成绩和胜利，推广成功的经验，表扬好人好事，大树红旗，大立标兵；也要深入检查工作中的缺点，广泛开展批评和自我批评，分析产生缺点的原因，研究出克服缺点的办法，认真地总结工作中的教训。很好地总结这些经验，并把这些经验认真地贯彻到我们的工作中去，就会使我们的公社办得更好，更巩固，就为我们争取明年的农业大丰收和今后的继续跃进，打下坚固的可靠的基础。
