　　More than 80 cadres from Tianshui City who went to backward production teams have universally established "experimental plots" to strengthen the work of small teams.

　　The rural communes in Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, have universally established a "Commune Member Life Day" system. One hundred and sixty brigades in the county's eleven communes have established and maintained the "Commune Member Life Day" system. The 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month are designated as "Commune Member Life Days." Commune members have a day off for free activities to take care of household chores, visit relatives, study, or participate in various cultural and recreational activities.

　　The establishment of the "Commune Member Life Day" system has institutionalized the combination of work and rest, powerfully promoting production. In the days leading up to the life day, commune members strive to overfulfill production tasks to welcome the day of rest.

　　Caring for the Masses' Lives with Utmost Care

　　The Party General Branch of the Quanhud Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Liling County, Hunan Province, has consistently cared for the lives of the masses. The Party General Branch established a seven-member Welfare Committee, chaired by the general branch secretary. Production teams established welfare groups, and canteens established canteen management committees. The general branch assigned cadres above the level of fifty-six production teams to take charge, covering the propaganda and implementation of policies, improving the lives of commune members, and promoting production. They have made proper arrangements for the needs of commune members in all aspects of life. After the problems in the lives of commune members were resolved, their enthusiasm for production became even higher.

　　After satisfying the diverse needs of commune members through the above methods, the commune members were very satisfied, and their enthusiasm for production was further enhanced.

　　Zheng'an Sends 2,500 Cadres Down to Canteens
