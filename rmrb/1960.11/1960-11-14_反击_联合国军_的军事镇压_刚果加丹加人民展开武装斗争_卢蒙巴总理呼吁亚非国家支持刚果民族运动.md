Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Elisabethville dispatch: The "UN Forces" are openly carrying out large-scale armed suppression of the people of Katanga Province, Congo. Their bloody atrocities have met with strong resistance from the local people.

It is reported that the "UN Forces," commanded by Irish Colonel Byrne, attacked Nyunzu on the 10th in three directions. On the 8th, an incident occurred in Nyunzu in which the "UN Forces" Irish intervention troops were armed resisted by the Baluba people. On the 10th, one of the troops of the three-pronged siege of the "UN Forces," with the order to "kill without mercy," rushed from Albertville to suppress the local people, opening fire on them. The Baluba people resolutely fought back with primitive weapons such as bows and arrows. It is reported that at least ten Baluba people were brutally murdered by the "UN Forces."

The report also said that the other two "UN Forces" are surrounding Nyunzu from Manono and Nienzu.

At the same time, in the northwestern region of Katanga Province, the patriotic struggle of the Baluba people continues. On the same day, the Baluba people built roadblocks on the highway from Kabongo to Kamina, preparing to resist the reactionary troops of the Tshombe clique.

In addition, Baluba patriots warned European colonists occupying Katanga Province's largest coal mine, the Luena coal mine, that unless they return the illegally occupied mines to the Baluba people, the Baluba people will launch a new struggle. It is reported that the "UN Forces" there deliberately maintained the interests of the colonists and on the 9th occupied the bridge on the strategic highway in the Luena area, preparing to interfere in the struggle of the local people.

Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Leopoldville dispatch: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba wrote a letter to the Executive Committee of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, which is meeting in Beirut, calling on Asian and African countries to support the Congolese national movement.

Prime Minister Lumumba said in his letter that "the Congolese people are struggling to defend their unity and independence against imperialist conspiracies and the conspiracies of imperialist agents."

He said, "The imperialists and their agents are trying to harm the Congolese people, its legitimate government, and its elected parliament."

The letter said, "They are using dollars to buy people and trying to create divisions between the people and the army. However, the Congolese people love me and help me, which explains why the imperialists are engaged in conspiracies."

At the same time, the Mobutu rebel group continues to run amok in Leopoldville, intensifying the persecution of people who support the Lumumba government. According to reports, Mobutu's reactionary troops suddenly surrounded the residence of Kamitatu, the governor of Leopoldville Province and leader of the African Solidarity Party, on the 10th, arresting Kamitatu and more than a dozen others.

Kamitatu had publicly condemned the atrocities of the Mobutu group and expressed his support for Lumumba's legitimate central government.

Xinhua News Agency, November 13th: Leopoldville dispatch: After the Mobutu rebel group arrested the governor of Congo's Leopoldville Province, Kamitatu, on the evening of the 10th, who was considered a supporter of Prime Minister Lumumba, the people of the Congolese capital successively demonstrated demanding his release. After being detained by the rebel group for three days, Kamitatu was announced to have been released today by Mobutu.

On the evening of the 11th, about 500 residents of Leopoldville went to Mobutu's residence to demonstrate, demanding the release of the governor.

Prior to this, Leopoldville residents had also demonstrated in front of the "UN Headquarters" in Congo, demanding the release of Kamitatu.

    刚果加丹加人民展开武装斗争
    卢蒙巴总理呼吁亚非国家支持刚果民族运动
    新华社11日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：“联合国军”公然对刚果加丹加省人民进行大规模的武装镇压。他们的血腥暴行遭到了当地人民强烈反击。
    据报道，由爱尔兰上校伯尔尼指挥的“联合国军”，10日分三路进攻尼昂巴。尼昂巴在8日曾经发生“联合国军”爱尔兰干涉军遭受巴卢巴族人武装抗击的事件。10日，三路围攻的“联合国军”中的一支部队带着“格杀勿论”的命令从阿尔伯特维尔赶来镇压，向当地人民开枪。巴卢巴人用弓箭等原始武器进行了坚决回击。消息说，至少有十名巴卢巴人被“联合国军”残杀。
    消息还说，另外两支“联合国军”正从马诺诺和尼恩祖向尼昂巴包围。
    在这同时，在加丹加省西北部地区，巴卢巴族人的爱国斗争在继续进行。同一天，巴卢巴人民在卡邦戈通往加米纳的公路上筑起路障，准备抗击冲伯集团的反动军队。
    另外，巴卢巴爱国者向占据加丹加省最大煤矿——卢埃纳煤矿的欧洲殖民者提出警告：除非他们把非法占据的矿山交还给巴卢巴人，否则巴卢巴人将展开新的斗争。消息说，那里的“联合国军”蓄意维护殖民者的利益，9日占领了卢埃纳地区战略公路上的桥梁，准备干涉当地人民的斗争。
    新华社11日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴写信给正在贝鲁特开会的亚非人民团结组织执行委员会，呼吁亚非国家支持刚果的民族运动。
    卢蒙巴总理在信中说，“刚果人民正在为反对帝国主义阴谋和反对帝国主义代理人的阴谋以保卫自己的统一和独立而斗争”。
    他说，“帝国主义者及其代理人正在设法危害刚果人民、它的合法政府和它的选举出来的议会。”
    信中说，“他们在用美元收买人、企图在人民和军队之间制造分裂。但是，刚果人民爱护我和帮助我，这就说明了为什么帝国主义要搞阴谋活动。”
    在这同时，蒙博托叛乱集团继续在利奥波德维尔胡作非为，加紧迫害支持卢蒙巴政府的人。据报道，蒙博托的反动军队10日突然包围了利奥波德维尔省省长、非洲团结党领袖卡米塔图的住所，逮捕了卡米塔图及其他十余人。
    卡米塔图曾经公开谴责蒙博托集团的暴行，并表示支持卢蒙巴合法的中央政府。
    据新华社13日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：在蒙博托叛乱集团于10日晚间逮捕被认为是支持卢蒙巴总理的刚果利奥波德维尔省省长卡米塔图以后，刚果首都人民接连示威要求释放他。卡米塔图在被叛乱集团拘禁了三天以后，今天据蒙博托宣布已被释放。
    11日晚间，利奥波德维尔居民约五百人曾前往蒙博托的住所前示威，要求释放这位省长。
    在这以前，利奥波德维尔居民还曾到驻刚果的“联合国总部”前示威，要求释放卡米塔图。
