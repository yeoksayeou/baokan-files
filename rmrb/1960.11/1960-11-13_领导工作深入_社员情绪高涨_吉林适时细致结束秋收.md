    Leadership Work Deeply, Commune Members' Morale is High
    Jilin Appropriately and Meticulously Concludes Autumn Harvest
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the autumn production movement centered on the autumn harvest has achieved great victory in Jilin Province. Although the sown area of autumn harvest crops this year was larger, there was more rational close planting, and more high-yield crops, greatly increasing the workload of the harvest, the harvest progress was very fast. By the end of October, the reaping and transportation of various crops throughout the province had been basically completed, shortening the harvest period by about ten days compared with previous years. By seizing the harvest opportunity, reducing damage from cutting, dropping, wind, rain, birds and beasts, both grain and industrial raw material crops, potatoes and vegetables, agricultural products and by-products were harvested relatively cleanly. According to inspections in Siping, Baicheng, Changchun, Jilin and other areas, 40 to 50 jin of grain were scattered less per hectare than in previous years.

    Not only was the autumn harvest grasped tightly and meticulously, but the small autumn harvest also achieved great results. As of October 20, statistics showed that the province had collected a total of 2.09 million tons of various wild plants; the amount of livestock feed stored was double that of the same period last year.

    Preparations for next year's agricultural production are also underway. As of November 5, the autumn plowing area in the province had reached 1.03 million hectares, a large number of improved varieties had been selected and retained, and a large amount of farm manure had been prepared. Some places have also promoted winter sowing of early spring crops such as spring wheat, millet, and oil crops. Baicheng area has now winter-sown more than 6,000 hectares.

    Before the start of the autumn harvest, people's communes, management areas, and production teams at all levels in Jilin Province successively formulated plans to increase production and conserve resources, and grain protection and harvest contracts. In order to harvest more grain and make up for the losses caused by the floods in some areas of the eastern region in mid-August, more than 30,000 production teams of people's communes throughout the province were largely involved in the competition to harvest in a timely manner, harvest carefully, and thresh meticulously from the very beginning of the autumn harvest. Heroic figures who carefully harvested and cherished grain emerged in batches. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties including Helong, Yanji, Daan, Yongji, Yushu, and Dehui, more than 70,000 pacesetters in careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, more than 18,000 "Red Flag Families," and more than 3,000 "Red Flag Threshing Grounds" emerged during the autumn harvest.

    The mass movement of all walks of life supporting agriculture reached an unprecedented scale during the autumn harvest. Nearly three million staff members of government agencies at all levels, enterprise workers, school teachers and students, and officers and soldiers of the garrison forces throughout the province formed a mighty force and rushed to the forefront of agriculture to help with the harvest. The industrial and financial and trade systems tried every means to provide the countryside with tools, equipment and technical assistance. The number of autumn harvest machines rushed out by state-owned industries increased by more than double compared with the same period last year.

    The leadership of party organizations at all levels in the autumn harvest movement became more in-depth, meticulous, and practical. There were 240,000 cadres throughout the province who went deep into the front line of the autumn harvest. In participating in production and leading production, they focused on using the method of "dissecting sparrows" and combining points and surfaces to summarize and promote many advanced experiences, which played a great role in promoting the autumn harvest movement in the province.

    领导工作深入　社员情绪高涨
    吉林适时细致结束秋收
    据新华社讯  吉林省以秋收为中心的秋季生产运动取得了巨大胜利。虽然今年秋收作物播种面积多、合理密植多、高产作物多，收获工作量大大增加，但是收获进度很快，到10月底，全省各种作物的收割、拉运即已基本结束，收获期比往年缩短了十天左右。由于抓住了收获时机，减少了伤镰、落镰和风雨、鸟兽的为害，无论是粮食或工业原料作物，薯类或蔬菜，农产品或副产品，都收获得比较干净。据四平、白城、长春、吉林等地区检查，每公顷地比往年少抛撒四、五十斤粮食。
    不但秋收抓得紧、抓得细，小秋收也取得很大成绩。截至10月20日统计，全省共采集了各种野生植物二百零九万吨；收贮的牲畜饲料比去年同期增加了一倍。
    明年农业生产准备工作，也在积极进行。到11月5日统计，全省秋耕面积已达一百零三万公顷，已选留了大量良种，准备了大量农家肥料。有些地方还推行了春小麦、谷子和油料等早春作物的冬播，白城地区目前已冬播六千多公顷。
    吉林省各地人民公社、管理区和生产队在秋收开始前，纷纷制定增产节约计划和爱粮保收公约。为了多收一些粮食，弥补8月中旬东部地区有些地方遭受洪水灾害所造成的损失，全省各地人民公社的三万多个生产小队，从秋收一开始就大部分卷入了适时收割、精收细打的竞赛热潮。精收细打珍惜粮食的英雄人物成批涌现。据和龙、延吉、大安、永吉、榆树、德惠等十县的不完全统计，在秋收中先后涌现出七万多名精收细打标兵，一万八千多户“红旗之家”，三千多个“红旗脱谷场”。
    各行各业支援农业的群众运动在秋收中达到空前未有的规模。全省各级机关工作人员、企业职工、学校师生和驻军官兵近三百万人，组成浩浩荡荡的队伍，奔赴农业第一线帮助抢收。工业、财贸系统千方百计地为农村提供工具、设备和技术帮助。各国营工业赶制的秋收机具比去年同期增加一倍多。
    各级党组织对秋收运动的领导更加深入、细致、踏实。全省有二十四万名干部深入秋收第一线，他们在参加生产领导生产中，着重运用“解剖麻雀”，点面结合的方法，总结推广了许多先进经验，对全省秋收运动起了极大的推动作用。（附图片）
