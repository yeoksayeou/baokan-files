Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Xia Liushui Brigade of the Hanjiaoshui Commune in Tongxin County, Ningxia, in the process of fulfilling its "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan for sheep production this year, gave priority to political and ideological work, combining inspection and comparison with commendation and the establishment of model workers. Through the implementation of the plan, the goals of all livestock professional teams (contracting units) in the brigade have become clearer, laying a good foundation for better implementing next year's "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan and striving for a bumper harvest in sheep production next year.

The "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system for sheep production in the Xia Liushui Brigade, based on the experience gained from last year's pilot project, has been fully implemented starting this year. The main contents of the three guarantees are: guarantee of production -- guaranteeing the quantity of sheep increase and the output and value of various livestock products; guarantee of labor -- guaranteeing various pastoral labor and labor for planting fodder and feed; guarantee of finance -- guaranteeing expenditures for animal husbandry and agriculture. Over the past year, the vast majority of livestock professional teams have conscientiously followed the "Three Guarantees" provisions. Herders have further strengthened their sense of responsibility, herding and raising sheep carefully, and doing everything possible to overfulfill the "Three Guarantees" tasks. Thanks to everyone's hard work, a double harvest of sheep and livestock products was achieved this year. In addition to selling and supporting other units with nearly 4,000 sheep, the net increase of sheep this year was 6,000 more than last year. All livestock products met the original production quotas, with the sales of wool and cashmere alone reaching 40,000 jin to the state. The total income from the sale of wool, fur, meat, and other products reached 51,000 yuan.

After the autumn shearing was completed and livestock production was basically over, the brigade's cadres, team leaders, herders, and accountants combined their efforts to implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan for sheep production. The brigade's Party branch combined the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" implementation with comparison and education, establishing models and promoting experience to achieve the goal of promoting production, organically combining ideological education and material incentives.

During the inspection and comparison, it was found that the Zhongquankouzi team had the most outstanding achievements in sheep breeding. The captain of this team, Ma Yinghu, often lived in the sheepfold, working and discussing with the herders and pen keepers. They resolutely protected the "lambs of the year" born to one-year-old ewes, actively providing milk for the "lambs of the year". As a result, all of the more than 130 "lambs of the year" survived and were healthy, overfulfilling the sheep breeding task and being established as a model sheep breeding team.

The Xia Liushui Brigade's implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan for sheep production using a combination of inspection and commendation has achieved three major effects: (1) It promptly summarized the experience and shortcomings of the first year of implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system for sheep production, laying the foundation for the early implementation of next year's "Three Guarantees and One Reward" plan. (2) Through the implementation of the plan, rewards and punishments were clearly defined, and all sheep production personnel in the brigade received a practical education that strengthened their sense of responsibility for production, clarifying everyone's goals. (3) Advanced experience was promoted.

At present, various teams have taken active measures to protect sheep from safely overwintering. Sheep production personnel are actively using substitutes to repair sheep sheds, ensuring that every sheepfold has a shed and that every sheep lives in a shed, making full preparations for a double harvest and double overproduction of sheep and livestock products next year.

    政治工作领先　检查评比结合
    下流水大　队羊只和畜产品双丰收
    “三包一奖”方案兑现，队队力争明年超包产
    据新华社讯　宁夏同心县喊叫水公社下流水大队在今年的羊只生产“三包一奖”方案兑现过程中，政治思想工作领先，做到了检查和评比结合，评奖和树立标兵结合。通过方案兑现，全大队各个畜牧专业队（承包单位）的努力目标更加明确，为更好地落实明年的“三包一奖”方案和力争明年羊只生产大丰收打下了良好基础。
    下流水大队的羊只生产“三包一奖”制，是在去年试点取得经验的基础上，从今年开始全面推行的。三包的主要内容是：包产——包羊只增殖数量和各种畜产品的产量、产值；包工——包各种牧业用工和种植饲草、饲料的用工；包财务——包牧业和农业的开支。一年来，绝大多数畜牧专业队都能认真地按照“三包”规定内容办事。放牧人员进一步加强了责任心，精心放牧、饲养，千方百计争取超额完成“三包”任务。由于大家辛勤努力，今年羊只、畜产品获得了双丰收。除了出卖和支援其他单位近四千只羊外，今年比去年净增羊只六千只。畜产品样样完成原订包产指标，仅羊绒、羊毛一项就交售给国家四万斤，出卖绒毛皮肉等产品的总收入达五万一千多元。
    秋毛剪完，畜产品生产基本结束以后，大队的干部、小队长、放牧员和会计四结合，着手兑现羊只生产“三包一奖”方案。大队党总支则结合“三包一奖”兑现开展评比教育，树立标兵、推广经验，以达到促进生产的目的，把思想教育工作和物质鼓励有机地结合起来。
    在检查评比中发现，中圈口子队羊只增殖成绩最突出。这个队的队长马英虎经常住在羊圈里，和放牧员、看圈员同劳动同商量。他们坚决保护一岁母羊生的“当年羔”，积极为“当年羔”配奶，结果，一百三十多只“当年羔”只只成活、健壮，超额完成了羊只增殖任务，被树立为羊只增殖标兵队。
    下流水大队用检查和评奖结合的办法兑现羊只生产“三包一奖”方案后，收到三大效果：（一）及时总结了第一年推行羊只生产“三包一奖”制度的经验和缺点，为及早落实明年的“三包一奖”方案打下了基础。（二）通过方案的兑现，奖罚分明，全大队羊只生产人员受到一次加强生产责任心的实际教育，使大家的努力目标更加明确。（三）先进经验得到了发扬和推广。
    目前，各队已采取积极措施保护羊只安全过冬。羊只生产人员积极利用代用品添修羊棚，保证圈圈有棚，只只羊住在棚内，为明年的羊只、畜产品双丰收、双超产做好充分准备。（附图片）
