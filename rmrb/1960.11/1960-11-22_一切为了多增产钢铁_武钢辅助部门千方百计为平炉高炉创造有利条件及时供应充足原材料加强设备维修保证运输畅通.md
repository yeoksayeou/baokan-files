Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric: Wuhan Steel's steelmaking plant concentrates its efforts, grasps the main contradiction that auxiliary work types cannot keep up with furnace production, strengthens leadership over the production work of auxiliary work types, and ensures a steady increase in open hearth steel production. The entire plant created the highest monthly steel production record this year in October, and the output in the first ten days of November increased by 20% compared with the last ten days of October.

In the movement to increase production and practice economy, Wuhan Steel's steelmaking workers launched a labor competition, which rapidly increased the level of open hearth production. This was immediately followed by a new contradiction, namely, the failure of auxiliary production links such as ingot casting, mold preparation, and operation to coordinate. In particular, the slag was not cleaned up in time, and there were not enough ingot molds, which prolonged the smelting time of the open hearth and hindered the high yield of the open hearth. The steelmaking plant's Party committee seized these two key issues, and Party committee members led more than 30 section cadres to workshops and groups to mobilize the masses to summarize the experience of cooperation in various links of steelmaking production. The workers of each work type also focused on these two key issues, found out the weak links in their work, formulated measures, and launched a competition. They first launched the battle to "attack the slag barrier." Factory and workshop leaders went to the front line and worked with the workers. The raw materials workshop and the mechanical power section also organized forces to support slag removal. Within three days, 3,700 tons of steel slag and waste were removed, and vehicles and other equipment for transporting slag were repaired, giving the plant a new look. In order to consolidate the achievements of the "slag attack" and ensure that the slag transportation lines were always unobstructed, the ingot casting workers also developed a plan showing the fixed positions of steel tapping spouts, scrap steel cans, and other items for easy transfer according to the plan. The workers who handled slag also created the experience of quickly turning slag cans, which improved the efficiency of can turning. The workers on the open hearth also actively promoted Xiong Dahan's method of "one can replacing two cans" for slag discharge, which greatly improved slag discharge and reception.

In order to accelerate the turnover of molds and coordinate with the open hearth's punctual tapping of steel, the entire plant, led by the Party committee secretary and factory director, with the mold preparation workshop as the main force and other workshops cooperating, organized more than 450 people to besiege the "mold barrier." They concentrated their efforts to clear more than 10,000 tons of scrap steel and waste from the site, improving the operating conditions on site. With the support of brother units, they concentrated more than 60 cutting workers to deal with 157 solidified central pouring pipes, creating conditions for accelerating mold turnover. In the work of repairing molds, workers in various processes such as demolding, cleaning the bottom plate, removing bricks, and grinding brick seams closely cooperated, rapidly increasing the daily and shift production from two sets of molds to five sets. The number of molds in constant turnover is now about half more than in the past, basically guaranteeing the needs of tapping steel.

The victories of these two plant-wide attacks on the slag barrier and the mold barrier also promoted the active cooperation of various auxiliary workshops such as transportation, mechanical power, and raw materials in increasing open hearth production. They all strengthened equipment maintenance to ensure safe operation. Crane workers took the initiative to propose a joint performance competition to accelerate the transfer of molten iron to the open hearth, mixer, and charging machine workers. Because of the close cooperation of various links, the time for each transfer of molten iron was shortened from the fastest 40 minutes in the past to 12 minutes. The mechanical power section also carried out mass maintenance of equipment, cleaned up dangerous circuits on the platform, adjusted the company's switches, etc., reducing equipment accidents.

With the strong cooperation of the auxiliary workshops, the open hearth workers also launched a performance competition centered on furnace protection. In October, the effective operation of the open hearth increased by 29.44% compared with September, and the loading volume also expanded, creating conditions for continuously increasing production.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan Electric: Employees of various functional departments and production auxiliary departments of Wuhan Steel go deep into the front line of steel production and try every means to provide more favorable conditions for a substantial increase in steel production.

Timely supply of sufficient raw materials and materials is an important link to ensure that open hearth and blast furnaces are well-fed. To this end, the raw materials and fuel department sends people to the steelmaking plant and the ironmaking plant every day to understand the consumption and inventory of raw materials. When they learned that the steelmaking plant's inventory of iron oxide scale was not large, the director of the department personally came forward and quickly found the source of supply, thereby ensuring the necessary reserves. If the supply of ferromanganese is insufficient, this department also uses the method of self-smelting ferromanganese to ensure supply. In order to solve the quality problem of the steel ladle stoppers, the director of the refractory materials factory personally led veteran workers to the steelmaking plant for inspection and immediately improved the measures to make the quality of this part meet the requirements.

Water, electricity, wind, steam, gas, transportation, and telephones are the arteries of steel production, so employees are particularly careful to ensure that they are unimpeded. Employees of the transportation department have achieved "transporting whatever production needs, transporting as much as is needed, and transporting whenever it is needed." In order to ensure that the compressed air supplied to the steelmaking plant has sufficient high pressure, the power plant has specially laid a dedicated line, and ensures the safe supply of water, electricity, wind, and gas to the entire company by means of diligent inspection and repair. The employees of the telecommunications workshop of this plant inspect the telephone handsets every morning before 5 o'clock to ensure that the company's telephone communication with various production plants is smooth.

The units concerned also adopted the method of "delivering to the door and providing on-site service" to strengthen equipment maintenance and the supply of spare parts. The electrical repair workshop of the power plant adopted the method of "visiting to ask about needs." When they found that some important parts on the distribution panel of the crane substation in the steelmaking plant had no spare parts, they immediately manufactured a batch and sent it to the site.

    一切为了多增产钢铁
    武钢辅助部门千方百计为平炉高炉创造有利条件及时供应充足原材料加强设备维修保证运输畅通
    新华社武汉电　武钢炼钢厂集中力量，抓住当前辅助工种跟不上炉子生产这一主要矛盾，加强对辅助工种生产工作的领导，保证了平炉钢产量稳步上升。全厂10月份创造了今年以来月钢产量最高纪录，11月上旬的产量又比10月下旬增长20％。
    在增产节约运动中，武钢炼钢工人展开劳动竞赛，使平炉生产水平迅速上升以后，又立即出现了新的矛盾，即铸锭、整模、运转等各辅助生产环节配合不上，特别是渣子清理不及时，铸锭模子不够用，致使平炉冶炼时间延长，障碍了平炉高产。炼钢厂党委抓住这两个关键问题，由党委各委员分别率领科室干部三十多名到车间、小组，发动群众总结炼钢生产中各个环节协作的经验。各工种工人们又围绕这两个关键问题，纷纷找出自己工作中的薄弱环节，订出措施，展开竞赛。他们首先开展了“攻渣关”的战役。工厂、车间领导干部都亲临现场，和工人们一起劳动。原料车间和机械动力科等单位也组织力量支援清渣。在三天之内，就清除了钢渣、废物三千七百吨，抢修好运渣子的车辆等设备，使厂内面目一新。为了巩固“攻渣关”的成果，保证运渣子的线路经常畅通无阻，铸锭工人还制订了一个平面图，表明出钢槽、废钢大罐等堆放的固定位置，以便按图调运。处理渣子的工人，也创造了快翻渣罐的经验，提高了翻罐效率。平炉上的工人也积极推广了熊大汉的“一罐顶两罐”的放渣法，大大改进了放渣、接渣工作。
    为了加速模子周转，配合平炉正点出钢，全厂又在党委书记和厂长带领下，以整模车间为主、其他车间配合，组织了四百五十多人，围攻“模子关”。他们集中力量清除了现场的一万多吨废钢、废物等，改善了现场操作条件。他们又在兄弟单位支援下，集中了六十多名切割工，处理了一百五十七个凝住了的中注管，为加速模子周转创造了条件。在修整模子的工作中，脱模、清底板、下砖、磨砖缝等各个工序的工人，都紧密配合，使每天每班作两套模子迅速提高到五套。现在经常周转的模子比过去增加了一半左右，基本上保证了出钢需要。
    这两次全厂性的围攻渣关、模子关的胜利，也促进了运转、机械动力、原料等各个辅助车间，积极配合平炉增产。他们都纷纷加强设备维修，保证安全运转。吊车工人们主动向平炉、混铁炉、装料机的工人提出开展加速兑铁水的联合表演赛。由于各个环节紧密配合，他们兑每一次铁水的时间，由过去最快的四十分钟缩短为十二分钟。机械动力科也开展群众性的维护设备的工作，清理平台危险电路，调整全厂的开关器等，减少了设备事故。
    在辅助车间有力配合下，平炉工人也展开了以护炉为中心的攻关表演赛。10月份平炉有效作业比9月份提高了29.44％，装入量也扩大了，为不断提高产量创造了条件。
    新华社武汉电　武钢各职能处室和生产辅助部门职工深入钢铁生产第一线，多方设法为钢铁大幅度增产提供更多的有利条件。
    及时供应充足的原料、材料，是保证平炉、高炉吃饱吃好的重要环节。为此，原料燃料处每天派人到炼钢厂、炼铁厂了解原料的耗用和库存情况。当他们得知炼钢厂库存氧化铁皮不多的情况以后，处长亲自出马，很快找到了货源，从而保证了必要的后备。锰铁货源不足，这个处也采用自炼锰铁的办法，保证了供应。为了解决盛钢桶塞头的质量问题，耐火材料厂厂长亲自带领老工人到炼钢厂检查，并立即改进措施，使这部件质量符合要求。
    水、电、风、汽、气、运输和电话是钢铁生产的动脉，因此职工们特别用心地保证让它们畅通无阻。运输部门职工做到了“生产需要什么运什么，要多少运多少，什么时候要什么时候运”。动力厂为了使供给炼钢厂的压缩空气有足够的高压，专门铺设了专线，并且以勤检勤修的方法，保证了全公司水、电、风、气安全供应。这个厂的电讯车间职工，在每天早晨五点钟以前检查一次电话话机，保证公司与各生产厂电话畅通。
    各有关单位还采用“送上门去、现场服务”的办法，加强了设备维修和备品备件的供应工作。动力厂电修车间采取“登门拜访问需要”的办法，在炼钢厂吊车变电所发现配电盘上有些重要部件无备品，回去以后立即制造出一批送到了现场。（附图片）
    武钢炼钢厂三号大型平炉工人在辅助车间的有力配合下，11月3日以十小时三十分钟炼出一炉合格钢，创造了这个炉投入生产以来的新纪录。这是三号平炉甲班全体工人在接班前听总炉长干荣久（右）讲解当班的任务和措施。　　　　　　新华社记者　李九龄摄
