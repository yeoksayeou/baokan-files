Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 18th — In the twenty months since the victory of the revolution, the Cuban economy has made continuous progress. Under the leadership of the revolutionary government, the valiant Cuban people are striving to increase industrial and agricultural production, actively developing a diversified economy to transform the single-crop economic structure based on sugarcane, and ensuring the independent development of the national economy.

In terms of sugar production, this year's sugarcane growth is good, and a bumper harvest is expected. All 160 sugar mills across the country, including 36 American enterprises, have been nationalized. The 80,000 caballerías of sugarcane land formerly belonging to sugar mill owners and large estate owners, which were taken over under the Land Reform Law, are now operated by more than 600 sugarcane cooperatives, which are composed of 100,000 agricultural workers. In order to strengthen production management and cooperation, the National Land Reform Committee recently adjusted the production organization and established 36 sugarcane cooperative organizations according to the location of the sugar mills. Each organization manages 15 cooperatives, one, two, or three sugar mills. Now, all Cuban sugar mills are operated by cooperatives, and their production is basically included in the national production plan. Agricultural workers planting sugarcane have shown unprecedented production enthusiasm, and they are very diligently weeding and fertilizing. It is expected that the yield per caballería will increase significantly in many sugarcane fields this year.

In terms of developing national industry, Cuba is starting from scratch. The state's investment plan for this year is more than 18 million pesos, which will be used to build and expand 57 textile factories, canneries, hoe and machete factories, wire factories, tobacco factories, rice mills, etc. In addition, with the assistance of socialist countries, Cuba has formulated an investment plan of 150 million pesos to develop certain basic industries, iron and steel metallurgical industries, and chemical industries. With the help of the Soviet Union, a steel plant with an annual output of 500,000 tons may be built in Oriente Province, which is rich in mineral resources, in 1965. Cuba's first hydroelectric power station is currently under construction in Las Villas Province.

In order to oppose U.S. imperialism's economic blockade and safeguard the development of the national economy, the revolutionary government has taken back the key sectors of the Cuban economy controlled by the United States, including sugar mills, mines, refineries, banks, transportation companies, electricity companies, and telephone companies. Three hundred and sixty large private enterprises have also been nationalized. In this way, the state-owned economy has gained an absolute advantage in industrial production. According to incomplete statistics, about 80% of the workers are working in state-owned enterprises. The revolutionary government has established a Central Planning Commission, which has recently begun preparations to formulate the first five-year plan for development of production and construction.

Workers working in enterprises and factories that have already been nationalized have demonstrated great enthusiasm in production. In the context of the shortage of raw materials and spare parts caused by the U.S. economic blockade, the workers have demonstrated creativity. They work overtime and voluntarily without pay in order to complete production quotas. Workers save raw materials or use old materials to replace previously imported raw materials. Compared with before the implementation of nationalization, the production of many factories has increased. For example, the production of alcohol factories has increased by 25% to 40%.

Since the implementation of land reform more than a year ago, significant changes have taken place in Cuban agricultural production. The large-scale measures taken by the National Land Reform Committee to develop a diversified economy have rapidly changed Cuba's semi-colonial economy, which used to rely solely on importing agricultural products from the United States. On a total of 150,000 caballerías of land recovered from feudal landlords and ranchers and that was barren, 780 production cooperatives have been organized, with a total of 70,000 farmers. These new types of agricultural and pastoral cooperatives are vigorously engaged in the diversification of crops with the help of the government. This year, rice, peanuts, corn, cotton, and soybeans have been planted on more than 12,000 caballerías of land in order to reduce imports of these products. Golden rice paddies are everywhere on the plains of Matanzas Province and in the fertile valleys of Oriente Province. Members are stepping up preparations for harvesting. In the past, Cuba lost an average of more than 140 million U.S. dollars annually on the import of edible agricultural products from the United States. In 1957, Cuba only planted 10 caballerías of cotton, but this year it has accelerated the expansion of the cotton planting area, planting a total of 1,500 caballerías. This will meet 50% of the country's cotton needs and save 10 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange. In terms of kenaf production, in addition to meeting domestic needs, Cuba also exports to the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic. Tomato cooperatives' production (previously 45% of tomatoes were imported from the United States) can not only meet domestic consumption but also be exported. This year's corn production will reach 3 million quintals. Potato production will reach 220,000 quintals. Coffee production will reach 800,000 quintals. Peanut and onion production will also increase.

In the past, large livestock owners who owned 1,058 large estates were the owners of more than one million head of livestock, occupying 115,000 caballerías of pasture. Now, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Reform Law, 600,500 head of livestock have been recovered at the end of the first year of land reform, and more than 500 livestock farms have been established. The conspiracy of large estate owners and large livestock owners to undermine the national economy has completely failed.

Because the revolutionary government is concerned about the residents' meat supply, it is vigorously developing animal husbandry. After the victory of the revolution, meat consumption increased by 25%. The total value of chicken, egg, and dairy products consumption increased by 50 million pesos annually. Due to the U.S. economic blockade, temporary difficulties have appeared in the meat market. The government has had to order no sales of chicken on Wednesdays and no supply of meat on Fridays. Prime Minister Castro recently announced that 200 poultry farms are being established with the goal of supplying 12 million poultry per month. Turkey production will increase fivefold, that is, 50,000 turkeys per month.

Fisheries have also developed rapidly. In the past, the import of cod and canned sardines alone cost 65 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange annually. Now the revolutionary government has established 15 shipyards distributed around the island, which have begun to build a fishing fleet and are responsible for repairing and modernizing existing fishing boats. Thirty-two cooperatives with more than 13,000 fishermen have been organized, and fishery centers and frog farms are being established.

Facts show that as soon as Cuba gets rid of the economic shackles of U.S. imperialism, resolutely controls national wealth, and implements land reform, relying on its own efforts, it can overcome the various difficulties created by the United States and develop its own national economy.

    古巴发展民族经济不断取得进展
    控制一切的美国势力已被逐出经济要害部门  积极发展多种经济改变半殖民地的经济结构
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　革命胜利二十个月以来，古巴经济不断取得了进展。在革命政府的领导下，英勇的古巴人民努力增加工农业生产，积极发展多种经济以改造以甘蔗为基础的单一作物的经济结构，保证了国家经济的独立发展。
    在糖的生产方面，今年的甘蔗生长情况良好，预计会得到丰收。全国一百六十个糖厂，其中包括三十六个美国企业，都已经实现了国有化。根据土地改革法接管的过去属于糖厂主和大庄园主的八万卡瓦耶里亚的甘蔗地现在由六百多个甘蔗合作社经营，这些合作社是由十万名农业工人组成的。为了加强生产上的管理和合作，土地改革全国委员会最近调整了生产组织，根据糖厂的位置建立了三十六个甘蔗合作社组织。每一个组织管理十五个合作社，一个、两个或三个糖厂。现在，古巴全部糖厂都是由合作社经营的，它们的生产基本上已列入了国家的生产计划。种植甘蔗的农业工人表现了空前的生产热情，他们非常勤劳地除草和施肥。预料今年在许多甘蔗田里，每卡瓦耶里亚的产量将有显著的提高。
    在发展民族工业方面，古巴正在从头做起。国家今年的投资计划是一千八百多万比索，这些钱用来建设和扩建五十七个纺织厂、罐头厂、镐头和砍刀厂、金属丝厂、烟草厂和辗米厂等。此外，在社会主义国家的援助下，古巴制定了一亿五千万比索的投资计划，来发展某些基础工业、钢铁冶金工业和化学工业等。在苏联的帮助下，可能在1965年在矿藏丰富的奥连特省建成一个年产五十万吨的钢铁厂，古巴第一座水力发电站目前正在拉斯维利亚斯省建设中。
    为了反对美帝国主义的经济封锁和保卫国民经济的发展，革命政府收回了美国控制的古巴经济的要害部门，其中包括糖厂、矿山、炼油厂、银行、运输公司、电力公司和电话公司等。三百六十家私人大企业也被收归国有了。国营经济就是通过这种方式在工业生产上占了绝对的优势。根据不完全的统计，约有80％的工人是在国营企业里工作的。革命政府建立了中央计划委员会，这个委员会最近已开始进行筹备工作，准备制定发展生产和建设的第一个五年计划。
    在已经收归国有的企业和工厂中工作的工人在生产上发挥了巨大的热情。美国的经济封锁造成原料和修配零件的不足，在这种情况下，工人们发挥了创造精神。他们加班加点地工作，而且自愿地不拿工资，以便完成生产定额。工人们节约原料，或者利用旧材料来代替以前进口的原料。同实行国有化以前比较，不少工厂的生产都有了提高。例如，生产酒精的工厂生产增加了25％到40％。
    土地改革实行一年多以来，古巴农业生产上发生了显著的变化。土地改革全国委员会所采取的大规模发展多种经济的措施迅速地改变了古巴过去只依靠从美国进口农产品的这种半殖民地经济。在从封建大庄园主和畜牧业主手里收回的和荒芜的总共十五万卡瓦耶里亚的土地上，已经组织了七百八十个生产合作社，总共有七万农户。这些新型的农牧业合作社在政府的帮助下大力进行着农作物的多种经营。今年已经在一万二千多卡瓦耶里亚的土地上种植了稻子、花生、玉米、棉花和大豆，以便减少这些产品的进口。在马坦萨斯省的平原上和奥连特省肥沃的山谷中，到处是金色稻田。社员们在加紧进行收割的准备工作。在过去，古巴从美国进口食用农产品一项平均每年就要损失一亿四千多万美元。1957年，古巴只种植了十卡瓦耶里亚的棉花，可是今年却加速地扩大了棉花的播种面积，共种了一千五百卡瓦耶里亚。这样一来就能够满足国家所需棉花的50％，可以节约一千万美元的外汇。在箭麻生产方面，除了满足国内需要之外，古巴还出口到苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国。西红柿合作社的生产（以前45％的西红柿是从美国进口的）不仅能够满足国内的消费，而且可以出口。今年的玉米生产将达到三百万公担。土豆将达二十二万公担。咖啡八十万公担。花生和洋葱的生产也将有所增加。
    以前，拥有一千零五十八个大庄园的大畜牧业地主是一百多万头牲畜的主人，占有着十一万五千卡瓦耶里亚的牧场。现在，根据土地改革法的规定，在土地改革第一年末已经收回了六十万零五千头牲畜，建立了五百多个畜牧场。大庄园主和大畜牧业主破坏国家经济的阴谋完全破产了。
    由于革命政府关心居民的肉类供应问题，它大力发展畜牧业。革命胜利后，肉类的消费增加了25％。鸡、蛋和乳类产品的消费总值每年增加了五千万比索。由于美国实行经济封锁，肉类市场上出现了暂时的困难。政府不得不下令星期三不卖鸡，星期五不供应肉类。卡斯特罗总理最近宣布，正在建立二百个养禽场，目标是每月供应一千二百万只家禽。火鸡的生产将可增加五倍，也就是说，每月五万只火鸡。
    渔业也得到了迅速的发展，从前单是进口鳕鱼和沙丁鱼罐头，每年就要损失六千五百万美元的外汇。现在革命政府已经建立了分布在全岛周围的十五个造船厂，它们已经开始建造一支捕渔船队和担负起了修理现有渔船并使其现代化的任务。已经组织了有一万三千多渔户参加的三十二个合作社，并且正在建立渔业中心和田鸡养殖场。
    事实表明，古巴刚一摆脱美帝国主义的经济羁绊，就坚决地控制了民族的财富，并且实行了土地改革，依靠自己的努力，就能够克服美国制造的各种困难和发展它自己的国民经济。
