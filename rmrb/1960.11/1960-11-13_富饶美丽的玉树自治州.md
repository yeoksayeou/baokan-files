Information:

    The Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is located in the southwest of Qinghai Province, bordering Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Tibet. The prefecture governs eight counties: Yushu, Chengduo, Angqian, Zaduo, Zhidu, Qumalai, Tianhe, and Jiangnan, covering an area of more than 269,000 square kilometers. It is inhabited by Tibetan, Han, Hui, Tu, and other ethnic groups, with Tibetans accounting for more than 85% of the total population. It is located in the central part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with famous mountains such as the Kunlun Mountains, Tanggula Mountains, and Bayan Har Mountains. The Yangtze River and the Yellow River, China's largest rivers, originate here. The prefecture has abundant water resources, ample rainfall, lush pastures, and fertile land, making it a good place for agriculture and animal husbandry.

    "Yushu is full of treasures, it depends on whether you can find them," which is the best description of the rich resources of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The territory is rich in mineral deposits. It is also one of the main fur producing areas in Qinghai Province. The wool fiber is fine, long, flexible and elastic, and can be called "Xining wool" in domestic and foreign markets. It is rich in valuable medicinal materials such as pilos antler, musk, caterpillar fungus, fritillary bulb, rhubarb, and bear bile. It is one of the main producing areas of medicinal materials in Qinghai Province, with an annual purchase value accounting for about half of the province's total, of which fritillary bulb and caterpillar fungus account for more than 90%. There are many kinds of rare birds and animals in the territory, and wild plants are everywhere. It is a natural zoo and botanical garden. Precious birds and animals include snow leopards, golden leopards, snow leopards, lynx, otters, marmots, snow chickens, and horse chickens. Breeding farms have been built in Zhidu, Yushu, Chengduo and other places, and lynx, foxes, deer, snow chickens, etc. have been domesticated. Wild plants have been widely used, and "ginseng fruit" (fern rhizome) and golden-rimmed mushrooms are found everywhere. Millions of catties can be harvested every year, which is a favorite non-staple food for local people. Wild fiber plants such as ramie, Apocynum venetum, and Apocynum pictum are good industrial raw materials. In the mountainous areas of Angqian and other places, ancient trees tower into the sky, and there are abundant red pines, willows, birches, spruces, etc. Many trees are more than one meter in diameter.

    Before liberation, this place was almost an undeveloped virgin land. Coupled with the cruel exploitation by the Kuomintang Ma Bufang bandit gang and reactionary forces among the Tibetan and Han nationalities, the people's lives were in dire straits. After liberation, especially after the people's communization, the construction undertakings of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have developed rapidly, and abundant resources have been initially developed and utilized. The prefecture has changed its past single operation of animal husbandry, and all counties have reclaimed wasteland for farming. The cultivated land area has increased more than twenty times than before liberation. For the first time on the plateau, crops such as wheat, potatoes, spinach and cabbage have been harvested. The situation of traffic closure has been fundamentally changed, and now all counties can be reached by car. Local industry and community-run industry have also developed greatly.

    富饶美丽的玉树自治州
    玉树藏族自治州位于青海省西南部，与四川、新疆、西藏接壤。全州辖玉树、称多、昂欠、杂多、治多、曲麻莱、天河、江南八县，面积二十六万九千多平方公里，居住着藏、汉、回、土等民族，其中藏族占人口总数85％以上。这里地处青藏高原中部，有全国闻名的昆仑山、唐古拉山、巴颜喀拉山等大山。境内大小河流纵横，为我国最大的河流——长江和黄河的发源地。全州水源丰富，雨量充沛，牧草丰美，土地肥沃，是宜农宜牧的好地方。
    “玉树处处宝，看你找不找”，这是对玉树藏族自治州资源富饶的最好写照。境内矿藏丰富。这里又是青海省的主要皮毛产地之一。羊毛纤维细长、柔韧有弹性，在国内外市场上能称“西宁毛”。这里盛产鹿茸、麝香、冬虫草、贝母、大黄、熊胆等名贵药材，是青海省药材的主要产地之一，每年收购总值约占全省的一半左右，其中贝母、冬虫草占90％以上。境内珍禽异兽种类繁多，野生植物遍地皆是，是一个天然的动物园和植物园。名贵禽兽有扫雪、金钱豹、雪豹、猞猁、水獭、旱獭、雪鸡、马鸡等。治多、玉树、称多等地已建起饲养场，驯养了猞猁、狐、鹿、雪鸡等。野生植物已广为利用，到处都有“人参果”（蕨麻）、金边蘑菇，每年可挖采几百万斤，是当地人民喜爱的副食品。玄麻、浪麻、罗布麻等野生纤维植物是很好的工业原料。昂欠等地山区古木参天，盛产红松、柳树、白桦、云杉等，许多树木直径粗达一米以上。
    解放前，这里几乎是一片未开发的处女地，加上国民党马步芳匪帮和藏汉族中的反动势力的残酷剥削，人民生活处于水深火热之中。解放后，特别是人民公社化后，玉树藏族自治州各项建设事业飞跃发展，丰富资源得到初步开发和利用，全州改变了过去单一经营畜牧业的状态，县县开荒种地，耕地面积比解放前增长了二十多倍，高原上破天荒地收获小麦、洋芋、菠菜和白菜等作物。交通闭塞的面貌已根本改变，如今县县可以通汽车。地方工业和社办工业也有很大发展。
