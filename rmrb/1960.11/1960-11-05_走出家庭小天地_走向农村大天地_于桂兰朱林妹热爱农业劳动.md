Leaving the Small World of Home, Heading Towards the Big World of the Countryside
Yu Guilan and Zhu Linmei Love Agricultural Labor

    (By Our Newspaper) Military officer's wife Yu Guilan actively responded to the Party's call and settled down in the countryside to participate in agricultural production. For more than two years, she has humbly learned from the masses and transformed from an urban woman into an expert on the agricultural front. In 1959, she gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party.

    Yu Guilan is thirty-five years old this year. Her husband is a military officer stationed with the People's Liberation Army in Tianjin. In the winter of 1957, when the unit called on military officers' families to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, she was the first to sign up. Some family members said to her at the time, "Your home is not in the countryside, and you haven't done farm work since you were little, so you shouldn't go to the countryside!..." Before everyone could finish speaking, Yu Guilan resolutely said, "The Party Committee Secretary said it well, agriculture needs a large number of laborers, and agriculture needs cadres. Military officers' families must have great ambitions to go to the countryside to build a socialist countryside."

    In this way, Yu Guilan came to Gufo Temple Township, Jinxi Commune, on the outskirts of Tianjin. On her first day at the commune, she requested to immediately participate in agricultural labor. The commune cadres were concerned that she had never done farm work before and worried about her physical strength. Yu Guilan confidently said to the commune cadres, "If my physical strength is not good, I can exercise it. If I don't know the techniques, I can learn them. I am here to settle down and participate in production. As long as production needs it, I can do anything!" Due to Yu Guilan's firm request, the military officers' families who settled down in the countryside with her worked very actively.

    Yu Guilan was honest and earnest when working. If she didn't know something, she would learn it. If she didn't understand something, she would ask. In the spring of 1958, the main labor force of the commune was concentrated in the gardens, repairing ditches and drawing water. Yu Guilan couldn't do anything, so she drew water with the commune members. After only a few strokes, her hands were chafed by the rope. People advised her to rest, but she said, "I am here to be a farmer, so I have to train myself in labor. How can I rest?" She went to Zhang Xuezhen, a production expert, to learn techniques. From then on, Yu Guilan followed Zhang Xuezhen in everything she did. In less than a year, Yu Guilan learned various production skills and became a production expert. Yu Guilan's practical actions won the understanding and trust of the masses. Soon, the commune members elected her as the women's production team leader.

    After the establishment of the commune, in order to thoroughly liberate the female labor force, Yu Guilan took the initiative to ask the Party to approve her starting a nursery from scratch. She organized several active women, whitewashed two old houses, and took the lead in taking out some clothes and bedding, dismantling and washing them, and making small mattresses and quilts for the children. After Yu Guilan's few days of running around, two nurseries were established, and 95% of the children in the village entered the nurseries. Young women were able to participate in labor in the fields, and the commune completed the plowing task ahead of schedule. In July 1959, Yu Guilan was approved as a glorious Communist Party member.

    (By Our Newspaper) Zhu Linmei, a member of the Tongxin Production Team of Yanqiao Commune in Pudong, Shanghai, is a staff member's family member. Since she participated in agricultural labor, she has taken the lead in everything and made outstanding contributions to agricultural production, becoming a good example for staff and workers' families to actively participate in agricultural production.

    In 1958, when the people's communes were realized in the countryside, Zhu Linmei was very happy. Recalling the road she had traveled from the mutual aid team, the primary cooperative, and the advanced cooperative, she came to the conclusion from her own experience: there is great potential in agriculture, and she is determined to work in the countryside for the rest of her life.

    At this moment, her husband, Lu Miaogen, who works at the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, returned home excitedly and said to Zhu Linmei: "The factory is recruiting a group of family members to help the kitchen do chores. Would you like to go?"

    "No, no!" Zhu Linmei refused without even considering it.

    "Peeling sweet potatoes, washing vegetables, the work is very easy, why don't you go?" Lu Miaogen asked curiously, not understanding his wife's thoughts.

    "Peeling sweet potatoes? If you don't grow sweet potatoes, where will you get sweet potatoes to peel? Besides, industry and agriculture must rely on each other. If everyone runs to the city, where will the grain and vegetables come from?"

    Although Zhu Linmei is a mother of many children and has many family burdens, in order to build a socialist countryside, she insisted on participating in field labor, regardless of wind or rain. Among the staff and workers' families, she is one of the most diligent in going to work.

    Zhu Linmei not only engages in agricultural labor tirelessly, but she also loves everything in the countryside very much. Wherever she is needed, she goes there. And she does her best to do the job well.

    In the previous period, more and more people were joining the commune's public canteen, and the staff working in the canteen were too busy. After Zhu Linmei learned about this, she volunteered to cook in the canteen.

    Recently, the commune lacked breeders. Zhu Linmei took over this job, which some people considered "dirty and smelly." In the pigsty, in addition to carefully feeding the pigs every day and washing and applying medicine to sick pigs, she also went to the vegetable fields to pick up leftover vegetables whenever she had time to increase the green fodder for the piglets. After more than a month of her careful breeding, more than a dozen of the thirty-odd mange pigs in the pigsty were cured.

    Zhu Linmei not only resolved to work in the countryside for the rest of her life, but also actively promoted the importance of engaging in agricultural production to the masses and encouraged them to love agricultural labor.

    走出家庭小天地　走向农村大天地
    于桂兰朱林妹热爱农业劳动
    本报讯　军官家属于桂兰积极响应党的号召，到农村安家落户，参加农业生产，两年多来，她虚心向群众学习，从一个城市妇女变成了农业战线上的能手，1959年光荣地参加了中国共产党。
    于桂兰今年三十五岁，爱人是解放军驻津部队的一位军官。1957年冬，部队号召军官家属下乡参加农业生产时，她第一个报了名。当时有的家属对她说：“你的家不在农村，从小又没作过农活，还是不到农村去吧！……”于桂兰没等大家说完，就坚决地说：“党委书记说的好，农业需要大批劳动力，农业需要干部，军官家属要立大志到农村去，建设社会主义农村。”
    这样，于桂兰来到了津郊区津西公社古佛寺乡。到公社的第一天，她就要求立即参加农业劳动，社里的干部考虑她过去没干过农活，怕她体力不行。于桂兰充满信心地对社干部说：“体力不好可以锻炼，技术不会可以学，我是来安家落户参加生产的，只要生产需要，什么都干得来！”由于于桂兰的坚决要求，到社的第一天就编进了生产队。在她的影响下，和她一起到农村安家的军官家属劳动得都很积极。
    于桂兰在干活时老老实实，不会就学，不懂就问。1958年春，公社的主要劳动力都集中到园田里去了，修渠的修渠，打水的打水。于桂兰啥也不会，和社员们一起打水，没打几下，手就被绳子磨破了，人们劝她休息，她说：“我是来当农民的，就要在劳动中锻炼，那能休息。”她去找生产能手张学珍学技术，从此，张学珍干啥，于桂兰就跟着干啥，不到一年，于桂兰学会了各种生产技能，成了生产能手。于桂兰用实际行动取得了群众的了解和信任，不久社员选她当了妇女生产队长。
    公社成立后，为了彻底解放妇女劳动力，于桂兰主动要求党批准她白手起家办托儿所。她组织了几个妇女积极子分，把两间旧房子粉刷干净，又带头拿出一些衣被，拆洗干净，作孩子们的小褥小被。经过于桂兰几天的奔跑，就办起了两所托儿所，全村95％的孩子都入了托儿所，青年妇女都能到田间参加劳动，社里提前完成了翻地任务。1959年7月于桂兰被批准为光荣的共产党员。
    本报讯　上海市浦东严桥公社同心生产队的社员朱林妹，是一个职工家属，她自从参加农业劳动以来，处处带头，为农业生产作出了出色的贡献，成为职工家属积极参加农业生产的好榜样。
    1958年农村实现人民公社化的时候，朱林妹非常高兴。她回想起从互助组、初级社和高级社这一段走过来的路，从亲身体会中得出一个结论：搞农业大有出息，坚决要在农村干一辈子。
    正在这时候，她的在上钢三厂做工的丈夫陆妙根，兴冲冲地回到家里，对朱林妹说：“厂里要招用一批家属工去帮助伙房干杂活，你去好吗？”
    “不去，不去！”朱林妹连考虑也没考虑就一口回绝了。
    “剥剥山芋，洗洗菜，工作很省力，为什么不去呢？”陆妙根没有弄清妻子的心事，好奇地问。
    “剥山芋？不种山芋，那有山芋剥呐？再说，工业和农业也要互相依靠呀，如果大家都朝城市跑，粮食、蔬菜又从那儿来呢？”
    朱林妹虽是个多子女的妈妈，家庭牵累很多，但是，她为了建设社会主义农村，不管刮风下雨，都坚持参加田间劳动。在职工家属中，她是出工较多的一个。
    朱林妹不仅这样不知疲倦地从事农业劳动，她对农村里的一切都很热爱，哪里需要，她就到哪里去。而且尽一切可能把工作做好。
    前一时期，社里公共食堂入伙的人越来越多，原来在食堂工作的人员忙不过来。朱林妹知道以后，就自告奋勇要求到食堂烧饭。
    最近，社里缺少饲养员。朱林妹又把这个有人认为“又脏又臭”的活接了过来。在猪棚里，她每天除了精心喂猪，给病猪洗刷搽药外，一有空就到蔬菜田里去拣落脚菜，给猪仔增加青饲料。经过她一个多月的细心饲养，猪棚里的三十几头癞皮猪，就有十几头被治好了。
    朱林妹不仅自己下决心要在农村干一辈子，而且还积极地向群众宣传从事农业生产的重要意义，鼓励他们热爱农业劳动。
