　　A Thousand Jin Burden is Carried by Everyone

　　The news from Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, about the establishment of core groups in the production teams of rural communes mentions the following: Chen Guisheng, the production team leader, was enthusiastic and active in his work, but because he did not unite the active elements around him, his work was not done well enough. Since the establishment of the core group, which united seven poor and lower-middle peasant activists, forming a strong leadership core, after only half a year of effort, the whole team showed a vigorous atmosphere in production, life, and political thought. This fact vividly illustrates the importance of collective leadership, and the importance of uniting active elements and mobilizing the broad masses.

　　The production team is the most basic organization for organizing production and the forefront of agricultural production. The production team is the focal point of many rural tasks and the base point for implementing the Party's policies among the masses. The production team must not only lead production well but also organize the lives of its members in an orderly manner. It is not enough to rely solely on the production team leader to do these tasks well. Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province, in the most basic production unit of the people's commune—the production team—universally absorbs poor and new and old lower-middle peasant activists to establish core groups, forming the collective leadership of the production team. This is an important measure to connect with the masses, mobilize the masses, implement the Party's guidelines and policies, and vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Because the members of the core group are responsible for specific tasks in one aspect, and around them there is a group of activists who understand the opinions of the masses and are familiar with the situation, this facilitates the concentration of the opinions of the masses, and also facilitates the effective implementation of the Party's policies to the broad masses through them. Therefore, in order to better implement the Party's policies in grassroots organizations, we must further strengthen the leadership of the production teams so that they can lead the entire production team to act completely in accordance with policies and win greater victories in various tasks.

    千斤担子众人挑
    湖南湘乡县在农村公社的作业组里建立核心小组的新闻中，提到这样一件事情：作业组长陈桂生，工作积极热情，但是由于没有把周围的积极分子团结起来，工作就做的不够好。自从建立核心小组以后，把七户贫农和下中农积极分子团结起来，形成了一个坚强的领导核心，只经过半年的努力，全组的生产、生活、政治思想三方面就出现了一片旺盛气象。这个事实生动地说明了集体领导的重要，说明了团结积极分子和发动广大群众的重要。
    作业组是组织生产的最基层组织，是农业生产的最前线。作业组是农村很多工作的落脚点，也是在群众中贯彻党的政策的基点；作业组不仅要领导好生产，还要把社员生活组织得有条有理。做好这些工作，单靠作业组组长是不行的。湖南湘乡县在人民公社最基层的生产单位——作业组里，吸收贫农和新、老下中农积极分子普遍建立核心小组，形成作业组的集体领导，这是联系群众，发动群众，贯彻党的方针政策，大办农业，大办粮食的一个重要措施。因为核心小组的成员，都负责一方面的具体工作，在他们的周围有一批了解群众意见、熟悉情况的积极分子，这就便于集中群众的意见，也便于通过他们把党的政策切实贯彻到广大群众中去。因此，我们要更好地在基层组织中贯彻党的政策，就必须进一步加强作业组的领导，使他们能带动全作业组的人马，完全按照政策办事，夺取各项工作的更大胜利。
