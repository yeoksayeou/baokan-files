Quality First—From the Kunming Xishan Agricultural Machinery Factory

    Venturing Out in the Rain to Obtain “Scripture”
    The Party branch of the Xishan Agricultural Machinery Factory in Kunming City constantly educates workers to improve product quality, making the idea of "Agricultural machinery production, quality first" deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.
    This is a newly established agricultural machinery factory with poor equipment conditions and technical strength. In October, during the production of threshers, the casting of the internal gear disc was crucial to the quality of the agricultural machinery. In order to improve the quality of castings, the secretary of the factory's Party branch personally led a group of workers, braving the rain to go to the Kunming suburban farm tool factory to learn and obtain experience. After learning the experience of lost foam sand casting, they worked continuously to build molds and test castings, improving the quality of the castings. The factory leadership, addressing the issue of low quality of the internal teeth on the internal gear disc, mobilized the masses to launch a tackling-key-problems campaign. The broad masses of workers used their brains, improved the molding sand, and made their own molding tools, enabling them to cast finished products in one go, which not only improved quality but also increased output, ensuring the timely, high-quality, and high-quantity completion of the production tasks in support of agriculture.

专栏：质量第一——在昆明西山农业机械厂里

    冒雨取“经”
    昆明市西山区农业机械厂党支部，经常不断地向职工进行提高产品质量的教育，使“生产农机，质量第一”的思想深入人心。
    这是一个新成立的农机厂，设备条件和技术力量都较差。十月份他们在生产打谷机中，铸造内齿盘是直接关系着农机质量的关键。为了提高铸件的质量，厂党支部书记亲自带领一批职工，冒雨前往昆明市郊区农具厂学艺取经，学习了漏模翻砂浇铸的经验后，连日动手打造漏模、试铸，提高了铸件质量。厂领导又针对内齿盘上的内齿牙质量不高的问题，发动群众开展攻关赛。广大职工开动脑筋，改进了造型的配砂，自制了靠模工具，一次就能铸出成品，不仅提高了质量，也提高了产量，保证按时、按质、按量完成了支援农业的生产任务。
