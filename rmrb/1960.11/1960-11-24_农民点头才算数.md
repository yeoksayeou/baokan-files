Quality First – At the Kunming Xishan Agricultural Machinery Factory

　　Farmers' Nods Are What Count
　　In the Kunming Xishan Agricultural Machinery Factory, whenever a new agricultural tool is trial-produced, the staff personally carries it to the fields for trial use, listening to the opinions of the management area and the production team. Only after the members nod in satisfaction does the factory proceed with batch production. What is described here is just one of many vivid stories. Before the autumn harvest, the factory produced the first batch of threshers. In order to assess the quality, the Party Branch Secretary led a group of workers, carrying the newly assembled foot-pedal type Boss threshing machine, to the Third Production Team of the Haiyuan Management Area of the Dongfeng Commune. After trial use, the members reflected: this type of thresher is efficient and fast, but it is too heavy. The Party Branch immediately convened a "Zhuge Liang" meeting on the spot, rushed back to the factory to modify it, and after the modification, carried it back to the management area for testing. The result: it was easy to pedal. The members all said, "It would be great if you could send more!" The factory immediately organized batch production to meet the needs of the autumn harvest.

专栏：质量第一——在昆明西山农业机械厂里

    农民点头才算数
    昆明市西山区农业机械厂里每当厂里试制出了一种新农具，职工们都要亲自抬到田间试用，听取管理区和生产队的意见，直到社员们头点满意后才进行成批生产。这里记述的，仅是许多个生动故事中的一个。秋收之前，厂里造出了第一批打谷机，为了鉴定质量，党支部书记率领一批职工，抬着才装好的脚踏式波司打谷机，来到东风公社海源管理区第三生产队。经过试用，社员们反映：这种打谷机工效高、速度快，就是太重了。党支部当场就召集“诸葛亮”会议，赶回工厂就动手改，改好后又抬到管理区试验。结果：蹬起来轻巧。社员们都说：“要是多送来几部就好了。”厂里立即组织成批生产，满足了秋收需要。
