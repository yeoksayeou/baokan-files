Conserving Materials, Facilitating the Masses

	Integrated Service for Disassembling, Washing, Mending
	The laundry, clothing, cotton cloth, and cotton-fluffing shops in Shanghai's Xuhui District, in collaboration with the neighborhood sewing groups, have jointly launched a one-stop integrated service for disassembling, washing, mending, dyeing, fluffing, and sewing autumn and winter clothes, which is very convenient for customers. Their approach is: the laundry, clothing, and cotton cloth shops accept the work separately; the laundry shop is responsible for washing, ironing, minor repairs; the clothing shop and neighborhood sewing groups are responsible for disassembling, turning, sewing, and mending; the cotton-fluffing shop and dyeing factory specialize in fluffing old cotton and dyeing clothes and fabrics. The new service not only saves customers from running around and spending time but also ensures that deadlines are met, work is completed quickly, and quality is good. A customer who was going to Chongming County in five days to support agricultural production, gave an old cotton coat to the Central Laundry Shop, requesting dyeing, adding cotton, and adding a lining. As a result, a brand-new cotton coat was delivered to him within four days. Previously, he would have had to visit the laundry, clothing, and cotton-fluffing shops, and the time would have been much longer. (New)

	Many Tricks and Skillful Hands
	In the courtyard at No. 10 Zhejiang Road in Tianjin, there are often two people sitting on benches, working with a clanging sound. The things piled up at their feet are truly diverse: bottomless broken iron buckets, broken earthen dustpans, broken sheet metal coal stoves, etc. After passing through their hands, these things can be cleverly modified into useful objects. They flatten the broken earthen dustpans and install them on iron buckets as bottoms; they make chimney elbows and water dippers from canned food boxes... The residents praise them, saying: "You have so many tricks, saving money and materials, turning waste into priceless treasures."
	It turns out that these two people are repairmen from the Xiaobailou Management Station of the Heping District Repair Service Company. Since learning from the advanced experience of "stationed-area service" on Dongliujing Road in Tianjin, this station has sent out several repair teams, adopting the method of "assigned areas, responsible to the end," to repair and fix things for residents. This repair team in the courtyard at No. 10 Zhejiang Road, in five days, repaired more than 140 items such as chimneys, stoves, pots, and basins, and most of them were modified using the residents' own waste materials.

	Fixed Collaboration for Repair Services
	The Baixia People's Commune in Nanjing has organized fixed collaborations between various industries, factories, and shops providing repair services, according to service content and sequential processes, implementing comprehensive services, which has solved many difficulties that could not be solved by separate repair services in the past, greatly increasing the number of service items. For example, the Wu Liangcai Glasses Shop could only repair ordinary glasses in the past. Now, this shop has a fixed collaboration with the Guangming Glasses Factory, and they support each other when there is a shortage of technology and manpower. No matter what kind of glasses, they can accept them and be responsible for repairing them. After the neighborhood residents' service station and service industries cooperated, the service station, which could only wash and mend in the past, has further expanded to be able to sew, dye, iron, and fluff (cotton). The number of service items in the entire commune has increased from more than 370 in the past to more than 530.

	Selling Goods and Repairing Old Items
	Department stores in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, both sell goods and repair old items, repairing what they sell, greatly facilitating the masses and saving social wealth at the same time. At present, there are ten major categories and more than 100 types of repair and refurbishment service items for daily necessities, ranging from clothing alteration, repairs, and sewing to replacing buttons.
	The department stores in this city have all listed the expansion of repair services as a major aspect of improving service levels. The staff of each store actively learn the skills of repairing daily necessities. The City No. 2 Department Store now repairs more than 40 kinds of goods, including repairing leather shoes, rubber shoes, clocks, zippers, and umbrellas, in addition to altering and repairing various garments. The repair services are characterized by low fees and quick turnaround, which are very popular among the masses. (Hua)

	Precise Cutting and Skillful Tailoring to Save Fabric
	Since the autumn, the commercial departments of Kaifeng City have organized excellent technicians in the clothing industry to form cutting technology innovation groups, designing more than 210 styles of autumn and winter clothing for men, women, the elderly, and children. The new designs and alterations to clothing use less material, are of high quality, and have beautiful and elegant styles. Due to tight material arrangement and reasonable cutting, the waste material is completely eliminated, and each set of clothes can save one to three feet of fabric. (Agency) (Attached image)

    节约物质  方便群众
    拆洗补缝综合服务
    上海市徐汇区的洗染、服装、棉布、弹花商店和里弄的缝纫组共同协作，举办了秋冬衣服的拆、洗、补、染、弹、缝一条龙综合服务业务，给顾客带来很大方便。他们的做法是：由洗染、服装、棉布店分头接活，洗染店负责洗烫、小修小补，服装店和里弄缝纫组负责拆翻缝补，弹花店和染场专管旧花弹松和染衣染布。新的服务方式不仅使顾客少跑路，少花时间，而且做到了约期准，交活快，质量好。一位要在五天内去崇明县支援农业生产的顾客，交给中央洗染店一件旧棉衣，要求染色、加花、配夹里。结果，四天内一件崭新的棉衣就交给了他。而在以前，他要跑洗染、服装、弹花三家商店，时间要长得多。（新）
    法儿多手儿巧
    天津市浙江路十号大院里，经常有两个人坐在板凳上，叮叮当当地干活。在他们脚边堆集的东西，真是五花八门，没底的破铁桶、残破的土簸箕、坏了铁皮的煤球炉子等，这些东西经过他们的手，都可以巧妙地修改成有用的物件。他们把破土簸箕砸平，装在铁桶上当桶底；把罐头盒子做成烟筒弯脖、水舀子……。居民们夸奖他们说：你们的办法真多，又省钱、又省料，废物变成无价宝。
    原来这两个人是和平区修配服务公司小白楼管理站的修配员。这个站自从学习了天津市东六经路“驻片服务”的先进经验以后，就派出了几个修配小组，采取“分片包干，负责到底”的办法，为居民修修配配。浙江路十号大院的这个修配小组，五天的功夫就修理了烟筒、炉子、锅、盆等一百四十多件，而且大部分都是用居民自己的废旧物料修改好的。

    修旧业务固定协作
    南京市白下人民公社把修旧服务的各行各业、各厂各店，按服务内容，组织前后道工序之间的固定协作，实行配套成龙，综合服务，解决了许多过去单独修旧服务所不能解决的困难，大大增加了服务项目。例如吴良材眼镜商店，过去只能修理一般眼镜，现在，这个商店和光明眼镜厂固定协作，遇到技术和人力不足的时候，就互相支援，不管哪一种眼镜他们都能接收下来负责修好。街道居民生活服务站和服务性行业开展协作后，使过去只能洗洗补补的生活服务站，也进一步扩大到能缝、能染、能烫、能弹（弹棉花）。全公社范围内的服务项目已由过去的三百七十多个增加到五百三十多个。

    既售货又修旧
    浙江省宁波市各百货商店既售货又修旧，经营什么就修理什么，大大便利了群众，同时节约了社会财富。目前，日用品修旧翻新服务项目共有十大类一百多种，大至服装翻改缝补，小至代钉钮扣，都包括在内。
    这个市的百货商店，都把扩大修旧业务列为提高服务水平的主要内容之一。各商店职工积极学习日用品修旧技术。市第二百货商店现在除翻补各种服装以外，还修理皮鞋、胶鞋、钟表、拉链、雨伞等四十多种商品。修旧业务都具有收费低、取件快的特点，深受群众欢迎。　（华）
    精剪巧裁节约用布
    开封市商业部门入秋以来组织服装行业优秀技师成立剪裁技术革新小组，设计出二百一十多种样式的男、女、老、幼秋冬季服装。按新设计新制和改修衣服，用料少，质量高，式样美观大方。由于排料紧密，剪裁合理，完全消灭了下脚料，每套衣服能节约一尺到三尺布。　（社）（附图片）
