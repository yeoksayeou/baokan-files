Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 14th: The visit and performance of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, led by Major General Zhang Ruihuan, on the Xiamen Front in recent days has been warmly welcomed and enthusiastically received by the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's three services and people from all walks of life in Xiamen. Slogans and cheers such as "Welcome the Korean People's Army Ensemble to visit the Xiamen Front!", "Long live the militant friendship cemented in blood between the Chinese and Korean people and armies!", and "Long live the unity between the Chinese and Korean people!" resounded throughout the front line in the air and on the sea.

Accompanied by Major General Wei Chuantong, representative of our Ministry of National Defense, all distinguished guests of the Korean People's Army Ensemble arrived in Xiamen by special train from Guangzhou on the 11th for a three-day visit, and left Xiamen on the 13th. Among those who went to the station to welcome and see off the distinguished guests were General Zhu Shaoqing, head of the Xiamen Front troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yuan Gai, First Secretary of the CPC Xiamen Municipal Committee, Li Wenling, Mayor of Xiamen, as well as more than 1,200 representatives from the three services of the Xiamen Front, representatives from all walks of life in Xiamen, and heroic models.

During their stay on the Xiamen Front, all the distinguished guests of the Korean People's Army Ensemble were divided into groups to conduct visits and performances in the front-line positions, front-line people's communes, factories, and Xiamen University. After arriving in Xiamen, the distinguished guests went in groups to the front-line positions for visits and performances in the afternoon of the same day, despite the rain. When Major General Zhang Ruihuan led a part of the delegation, accompanied by Major General Wei Chuantong, representative of the Ministry of National Defense, and leaders of the Xiamen Front troops, to a certain artillery position on the front line, all the officers and soldiers lined up to welcome the distinguished guests. Major General Zhang Ruihuan and other distinguished guests warmly shook hands and greeted the officers and soldiers, and pinned commemorative badges of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on their chests. Another group of delegation members, led by Colonel Cui Changyin and Lieutenant Colonel Jin Bingchun, deputy heads of the ensemble, visited a certain coastal artillery position accompanied by leaders of the front-line garrison, and met with the artillerymen of the People's Navy. As soon as the distinguished guests arrived, the artillerymen rushed forward and lifted Colonel Cui Changyin and Lieutenant Colonel Jin Bingchun high. The male and female members of the ensemble also cheered and lifted the leaders of the garrison high. The guests and hosts circled the position, cheering, and then formed a large circle in pairs, singing and dancing for the ever-increasing internationalist unity and militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean people and armies.

On the morning of the 12th, the distinguished guests visited Xiamen University and an industrial zone in separate groups despite the rain. Major General Zhang Ruihuan and a part of the delegation visited Xiamen University accompanied by leaders of the troops and Mayor Li Wenling of Xiamen. After the visit, Major General Zhang Ruihuan wrote an inscription for Xiamen University: "To all the teachers, students, and staff of Xiamen University, who stand firm on the Xiamen Front and have not only achieved great success in combining teaching, scientific research, and labor training, but also in defending the coast, I extend the friendship and congratulations of the Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army, and wish you even greater achievements in the future." When a part of the ensemble members, led by Deputy Heads Cui Changyin and Jin Bingchun, visited an industrial zone, Pei Jinshan, a member of the ensemble who came from a textile worker background, personally helped Zheng Shuyun, a production activist who had just learned to weave, to join the yarn in front of the loom, moving this 19-year-old girl to praise repeatedly: "I will definitely learn from the example of the Korean sisters' love and unity, and strive to improve my textile technology."

On the afternoon of the 12th, all the distinguished guests of the Korean People's Army Ensemble divided into four groups and continued to go deep into the front-line positions and villages to hold visiting performances for the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the militiamen and members of the front-line people's communes. When Major General Zhang Ruihuan and a part of the delegation, accompanied by Major General Wei Chuantong, local garrison leaders, and Mayor Li Wenling, came to the He厝 Production Brigade on the forefront of Xiamen Island, advanced units such as the nationally renowned "Ten Sisters of the Front Line," "Little Eighth Route Army," and "Mu Guiying Female Militia Class," as well as representatives of the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces, braved the heavy rain to greet the distinguished guests outside the village, and presented the Korean distinguished guests with bananas, pineapples, tomatoes, melons, and vegetables grown on "Wanbao Mountain," as well as sickles and axes made from the shell fragments of American-made artillery shells fired by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, on behalf of the front-line people's commune. Major General Zhang Ruihuan took these gifts and said excitedly: It is amazing that you have persisted in production and carried out the struggle against the enemy, and have grown such good crops under the artillery fire. This is the most precious gift, a symbol of the deep militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Then, Major General Zhang Ruihuan presented a huge banner to the heroic officers and soldiers of the Liberation Army on behalf of the officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army. On the evening of the 12th, all the distinguished guests of the Korean People's Army Ensemble held a grand visiting performance, with more than 5,000 soldiers and civilians gathering together to enjoy the wonderful performances of the distinguished guests. Before the performance began, the Xiamen Front troops, the CPC Xiamen Municipal Committee, the Xiamen Municipal People's Committee, and the Korean People's Army Ensemble presented each other with banners and gifts. General Zhu Shaoqing, head of the Xiamen Front troops, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the distinguished guests on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the three services of the Xiamen Front and the people of Xiamen for their visit and performance on the Xiamen Front, overcoming mountains and seas. General Zhu Shaoqing said: Your visit and wonderful performance are a powerful encouragement to the soldiers and civilians on the Xiamen Front, and a great support to our ongoing struggle against American imperialist aggression and to liberate Taiwan. The seeds of brotherly friendship sown by the comrades of the ensemble on the Xiamen Front will blossom into brilliant flowers. General Zhu Shaoqing said that we fully support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Major General Zhang Ruihuan said in his speech that the Chinese and Korean people and armies have shared life and death, and fought together for a long time, and are now fighting together against the common enemy—American imperialism. Today, the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the forces defending peace are incomparably strong. We are determined to fight for the peaceful reunification of our motherland. China's territory, Taiwan, will surely return to the embrace of the Chinese people. Our cause is just, and the just cause will surely win. Then, the People's Army Ensemble performed wonderful programs such as "Joy," "Comrades-in-Arms," "Wind and Snow," "Eagle Peak Mountain Ballad," and "Reunion on the Highlands." When the distinguished guests sang "We Must Plant the Red Flag on Taiwan" in Chinese, the whole audience boiled and applauded enthusiastically again and again. (With picture)
