    Taking on a Thousand-Jin Burden
    ——Seeing Off Comrades Supporting Agricultural Production on the Front Lines
    Ge Song
    Comrades who are going to the front lines of agricultural production all express the same sentiment: go wherever there are difficulties, go wherever it is most arduous, and take on burdens even if they weigh a thousand jin!
    The Party's entrustment and the people's trust are given solid and reliable assurance here. The revolutionary spirit and fearless courage are fully reflected in this one sentence.
    Facing a thousand-jin burden without fear or retreat, taking the world as one's own responsibility – this is the noble quality that every revolutionary cadre should possess. However, daring to choose the heaviest burden is only the first step in doing things well. There is also a second step: how to carry the burden.
    A thousand-jin burden carried by one person cannot be lifted or moved. Even if it is lifted, it is very difficult and impossible to walk steadily or quickly.
    A thousand-jin burden carried by many people is a completely different situation. Not only can it be lifted, but it can also be carried lightly and quickly.
    The power of the people is as endless as a volcano that never goes out. Revolutionary cadres should be like a spark, igniting the endless power of the masses. All revolutionary undertakings are the people's own undertakings. If the struggle of the people is abandoned when completing such undertakings, nothing will be accomplished. Therefore, the important issue is to believe in the power of the people, rely on the power of the people, and bring into play the high degree of enthusiasm and great creativity of the people, so that everyone can work together to carry the burden. When the iron arms of the people of the whole country are tightly joined together, not only can a thousand-jin burden be lifted, but even "lifting Mount Tai to cross the North Sea" can be accomplished.
    After Ping Liangde, a cadre transferred to the countryside in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, arrived in the rural areas, he thought: "The task assigned by the Party is to change the backward team. This burden must be taken up." But he did not consider how to carry this burden well. "So, every day he got up before dawn, knocked on doors and called the commune members to go to the fields, and spent the whole day dealing with sporadic affairs in the team and going to the fields whenever he had time, handling matters as they arose. As a result of undertaking everything himself, the original team cadres' burdens became lighter and lighter, while his own burden became heavier and heavier... In this way, trivial matters became more and more numerous." "Ping Liangde began to feel distressed. He said to Niu Shuifu, the secretary of the management area Party branch: 'I put in a lot of effort, but I still haven't made a name for myself. It's really not easy.' After listening to him, Shuifu thought for a long time and said to him: 'Lao Ping, you have indeed put in a lot of effort, but you haven't grasped the key. Think about it, how can a thousand-jin burden be carried on one person?'" (See People's Daily, November 4th)
    Comrades who go to the front lines of agricultural production must take the lead by setting an example. This is naturally an important point. However, an even more important point is to use their own exemplary actions to motivate and organize the broad masses to work together, turning the thousand-jin burden into a burden for everyone, enlightening the revolutionary consciousness of the masses, and mobilizing the broad masses to take the burden voluntarily. Comrade Ping Liangde initially only achieved the former, resulting in half the result with twice the effort. Only after he achieved the latter did he become a "good advisor" praised by everyone.
    Of course, to achieve "a thousand-jin burden carried by everyone," it is necessary to conscientiously publicize and implement the Party's policies, turning the Party's guidelines and policies into the conscious actions of the masses, so that the masses know what kind of burden this is and how heavy this burden is. "When the masses know the truth and have a common goal, they will work together wholeheartedly." A thousand-jin burden or a ten-thousand-jin burden is nothing.
    The process from a thousand-jin burden carried by one person to being carried by everyone is a process of implementing the Party's policies, as well as a process of contacting the masses, mobilizing the masses, learning from the masses, and leading the masses forward. If the policies are thoroughly implemented and the enthusiasm of the masses is fully mobilized, the heavy burden of developing agriculture will surely be lifted, and any heavy burden in the cause of socialist construction will surely be lifted.

    挑起千斤担
    ——二送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    走上农业生产第一线的同志们都有共同的表示：哪里有困难就到哪里去，哪里最艰苦就到哪里去，千斤重的担子，也要挑起来！
    党的委托，人民的信任，在这里得到了坚实可靠的保证，革命的精神，无畏的气概，在一句话里充分地反映了出来。
    在千斤重的担子面前，毫不畏惧，毫不退缩，以天下为己任，这是每一个革命干部应有的高贵品质。然而，敢于拣最重的担子挑，这只不过是办好事情的第一步。还有第二步，那就是：如何挑担子。
    千斤担子一人挑，挑不起，挑不动，即使挑起来，那也非常吃力，不可能走得稳，走得快。
    千斤担子众人挑，情况就大不一样了，不仅可以挑起来，还能够跑得轻快。
    人民群众的力量，像一座永不熄灭的火山一样无穷无尽。革命的干部要像一颗火种一样，使群众那股无穷无尽的力量迸发出来。革命的一切事业，都是人民群众自己的事业，完成这样的事业，如果离开人民群众的斗争，一定是一事无成。因此，重要的问题就是相信人民群众的力量，依靠人民群众的力量，把人民群众高度的积极性和巨大的创造性发挥出来，大家同心协力一起去挑担子。全国人民的铁臂紧靠在一起，不要说千斤重担挑得起，就是“挟泰山以超北海”，那也是完全能够办得到的。
    山西陵川县下放干部平良德到了农村以后，心里想：“党交给的任务，是改变落后队，这个担子非担起来不行。”可是这副担子怎么个挑法，却没有很好地考虑。“于是，他每天天不明就起床，按门逐户呼唤社员上地，整天价除处理队里零星事务外，抽空就下田，遇事就处理。大包大揽的结果，原来的队干部担子越来越轻，他自己的担子却越来越重……这样，琐碎事情越来越多。”“平良德开始有些苦恼了，他向管理区党支部书记牛水富说：‘出了个九牛二虎之力，还是没搞出个名堂来，真是不容易。’水富听了他的话，思谋了半天，对他说：‘老平，力气确实出得不小，但没有抓住纲，你想，千斤担子挑在一个人身上，那怎么能行？’”（见11月4日人民日报）
    到农业生产第一线去的同志，都要身体力行，带头干，这自然是重要的一条。但是，更重要的一条却是用自己的模范行动带动和组织广大的群众一齐干，把千斤重的担子变成众人的担子，启发群众的革命觉悟，发动广大群众人人都主动地来挑担子。平良德同志开始只做到前一条，结果事倍功半，待做到了后一条，他才成了人人称赞的“好参谋”。
    当然，要做到“千斤担子众人挑”，就要认真宣传和贯彻党的政策，把党的方针、政策变为群众自觉的行动，让群众知道这是一副什么担子，这是一副多么重的担子。“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做”，千斤重的担子，万斤重的担子，都算不了什么。
    千斤担子由一个人到众人挑的过程，是一个贯彻执行党的政策的过程，也是一个联系群众、发动群众、向群众学习又带领群众前进的过程。把政策贯彻到底，把群众的积极性充分地调动起来，大办农业的重担子一定挑得起来，社会主义建设事业中任何重的担子也一定挑得起来。
