Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 19th. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today issued a statement regarding the recent military advisors' conference held in Bangkok by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) aggressive bloc, led by the United States, condemning U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to draw in the SEATO aggressive bloc to interfere in South Vietnam and Laos.

　　The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism has for a long time continuously and increasingly crudely interfered in South Vietnam and Laos, instigating and assisting its lackeys, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and the Phoumi Nosavan group, to undermine the Geneva Agreements on Vietnam and Laos, in order to turn South Vietnam and Laos into U.S. military bases.

　　The statement said that, however, due to the strong struggle waged by the Vietnamese and Lao peoples, with the sympathy and support of peace-loving people in Southeast Asia and around the world, U.S. imperialism's crude policy of interference is suffering one failure after another. The victory of the August coup in Laos proves this. The statement strongly condemned U.S. imperialism and its running dogs for constantly and shamelessly slandering the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The statement said that the just public opinion of the people of the world has long clearly known that U.S. imperialism and the reactionary authorities of Thailand are the most arrogant interventionists and the main culprits in creating the current tense situation in South Vietnam and Laos.

　　The statement said that as one of the countries that signed the Geneva Agreements on Indochina, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns the SEATO aggressive bloc, led by the United States, for discussing the situation in South Vietnam and Laos at its military advisors' conference. This discussion is a crude interference in the internal affairs of Vietnam and Laos. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly opposes their interference in South Vietnam and Laos, their undermining of the Geneva Agreements, their threat to the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and their threat to the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

　　The statement concluded by saying that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares that U.S. imperialism and the countries that follow the United States must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences they have caused.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 19th. "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today saying that the SEATO military advisors' conference held in Bangkok by U.S. imperialism and its Southeast Asian lackeys was purely a bandit meeting convened to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. The commentary said that the mad interference of the U.S. imperialists has not been able to frustrate the Lao people's struggle for peaceful neutrality and national harmony. The Lao people, who support the Souvanna Phouma government and are waging a resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and the traitors of the motherland, are not isolated. The decision passed by the Royal Lao Government on November 16 to establish good-neighborly relations with the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a measure that justly reflects the wishes of the Lao people.

    反对东南亚条约组织干涉老挝和越南南方
    越南外交部发表严正声明
    “民主朝鲜报”谴责曼谷强盗会议
    新华社河内19日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天就以美国为首的东南亚条约侵略集团最近在曼谷举行军事顾问会议发表声明，谴责美帝国主义阴谋拉拢东南亚条约侵略集团干涉越南南方和老挝。
    声明指出，美帝国主义长期以来不断日益粗暴地干涉越南南方和老挝，嗾使和帮助其走狗吴庭艳集团和富米·诺萨万集团破坏关于越南和关于老挝的日内瓦协议，以便把越南南方和老挝变成美国的军事基地。
    声明说，但是，由于越南人民和老挝人民在东南亚和全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持下进行了强烈的斗争，所以美帝国主义的粗暴的干涉政策正在遭受一次又一次的失败。老挝八月政变的胜利就证明了这一点。声明强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗不断无耻地污蔑越南民主共和国。声明说，世界人民的公正舆论早就清楚地知道，美帝国主义和泰国反动当局才是最狂妄的干涉者，是制造越南南方和老挝当前紧张局势的元凶。
    声明说，作为签定关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议的国家之一的越南民主共和国，强烈谴责以美国为首的东南亚条约侵略集团在它的这次军事顾问会议上讨论越南南方和老挝的局势。这种讨论是对越南和老挝内政的粗暴干涉。越南民主共和国政府强烈反对它们干涉越南南方和老挝、破坏日内瓦协议、威胁越南民主共和国的安宁以及威胁印度支那和东南亚和平的行为。
    声明最后说，越南民主共和国宣布，美帝国主义和追随美国的国家对他们所造成的严重后果必须负完全责任。
    据新华社平壤19日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论说，美帝国主义和它的东南亚走卒们在曼谷召开的东南亚条约组织军事顾问会议纯粹是为了干涉他国内政而召开的强盗会议。评论说，美帝国主义者的疯狂干涉并没有能挫折老挝人民争取和平中立和民族和睦的斗争。支持梭发那·富马政府、为反对美帝国主义和祖国叛徒而展开坚决斗争的老挝人民不是孤立的。老挝王国政府在11月16日通过的关于同中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国建立睦邻关系的决定，是正当地反映了老挝人民的愿望的措施。
