    Mutual Overtaking and Mutual Supplementation
    Jing Yu
    Organizing production is a leadership art. A leader who is good at organizing production sees both the favorable and unfavorable aspects of the production situation in his assessment. He must not only determine the best goals, but also envision the worst possible scenarios. He should make two kinds of arrangements for the two situations, so that the production of the enterprise he manages is always stable, proactive, and invincible, whether in smooth or difficult circumstances. The "mutual overtaking and mutual supplementation" experience created by the No. 1 Coal Mining Team of Yangquan No. 4 Mine profoundly embodies this point.
    Industrial production has strong continuity. For the completion of production plans, it can only be continuously ahead of schedule, not continuously delayed. Therefore, under normal circumstances, each shift, each team (group) must strictly meet the requirements of completing the state plan on a daily, ten-day, and monthly basis, and strive to exceed it; even if they encounter a little difficulty, they must try every possible means to find measures to complete the task. If a shift loses production in a day, it will affect the completion of the daily plan. Failure to complete the daily plan will affect the completion of the ten-day plan and the monthly plan. The biggest feature of the "mutual overtaking and mutual supplementation" experience of the No. 1 Coal Mining Team of Yangquan No. 4 Mine is that the leadership not only has a set of "production supplementation" systems in grasping the daily plan, but also a set of "overproduction" measures. With a set of "production supplementation" systems, it can be achieved that the shift does not lose production and the day does not owe "debts". However, it is not enough to have only a "production supplementation" system, and it is necessary to further solve the problem of overproduction. Under the goal of overfulfilling the shift production daily plan, they launched an overproduction competition, requiring the second half of the shift to exceed the first half, the next shift to exceed the previous shift, and the next day to exceed the previous day. This makes the overfulfillment of the state plan more guaranteed.
    In industrial production, everyone will encounter unfavorable situations and unexpected difficulties, and there are even more unexpected changes underground. To deal with these unexpected changes, we can only rely on the strength of the collective. The reason why the No. 1 Coal Mining Team of Yangquan No. 4 Mine in Shanxi was able to create the experience of "mutual overtaking and mutual supplementation" and achieved good results is also because all the workers of this team have a noble communist style of everyone working for the collective. Their attitude in the overproduction competition is: if you exceed, I will also exceed; if you lose production, I will exceed even more; let's see who exceeds more and who supplements better. When encountering difficulties, their practice is to create conditions for each other, lay a good foundation for each other, leave the difficulties to themselves, and give convenience to others. As a result, although some shifts and groups did not complete the daily production plan on that day, from the average level of the entire team, some shifts opened up the difficult situation and created conditions for the overproduction of other shifts. The production tasks of the entire team were not only completed according to plan, but also completed very well. Here, it clearly tells us that the production cause is a collective cause, and everyone should develop a collective style and decide their actions under the guidance of the idea that collective interests are above all else. This is an important prerequisite for completing production tasks.
    From now until the end of the year, there are less than two months left. Those who have lost production must catch up quickly, and those who have overproduced must strive for more overproduction. Learning from the experience of the No. 1 Coal Mining Team of Yangquan No. 4 Mine is of great significance to the coal mining system and to other industrial systems.

    互超互补
    静宇
    组织生产是一种领导艺术。善于组织生产的领导者，对于生产情况的估计，既看到有利的方面，也看到不利的方面，既要确定最好的目标，又要设想最坏的情况。针对两种情况作两种安排，使自己掌管的企业生产不论在顺利或者困难的情况下，时时刻刻稳保主动，立于不败之地。阳泉四矿采煤一队创造的“互超互补”经验深刻地体现了这一点。
    工业生产的连续性很强，对于生产计划的完成，只能连续提前，不能连续推迟。所以，在通常的情况下，每个班、每个队（组）必须严格地实现按日、按旬、按月完成国家计划的要求，并且力争超过；即使碰到一点困难，也要千方百计，寻找措施，完成任务。在一天当中，如果一个班亏了产，那就要影响日计划的完成，日计划完不成就会影响旬计划和月计划的完成。阳泉四矿采煤一队的“互超互补”的经验最大特点，就在于领导上在狠抓日计划的工作中，不仅有一套“补产”的制度，而且有一套“超产”的措施。有了一套“补产”制度，就能做到班不亏产、日不负“债”。但是，仅仅有了“补产”制度还是不够的，必须进一步解决超产问题。他们在超额完成班产日计划的目标下，开展超产竞赛，要求后半班超过前半班，下一班超过上一班，下一天超过前一天。这就使国家计划的超额完成更有保证。
    在工业生产中，谁都会碰到不利的情况和意外的困难，而井下的意外变化则更多。对付这意外的变化，只有依靠集体的力量。山西阳泉四矿采煤一队所以能够创造“互超互补”的经验，并且取得了很好的效果，还在于这个队的全体职工具有一种大家为集体的高尚的共产主义风格。他们在超产竞赛中的态度是：你超我也超，你亏我更超，看谁超得多，看谁补得好。在遇到困难的时候，他们的做法是互相创造条件，互相打好基础，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人。这样做的结果，虽然有些班组没有完成当天日产计划，但从全队的平均水平来看，由于一部分班组打开了困难局面，为另一部分班的超产创造了条件。全队的生产任务不仅是按计划完成了，而且完成得很好。这里，清楚地告诉我们：生产事业是一种集体事业，人人养成集体主义的风格，在集体利益高于一切的思想指导下决定自己的行动，这是完成生产任务的重要前提。
    从现在到年底不到两个月了，亏产的要赶快补产，超产的还要争取更多的超产。学习阳泉四矿采煤一队的经验，对于煤矿系统，对于其他工业系统，都有重要的意义。
