One of the keys to running agriculture in a big way, and running grain production in a big way, is to run fertilizer production in a big way. Winter is the season for large-scale manure accumulation. How to accumulate more manure from human and animal waste, garbage, and other fertilizers, manage them scientifically, and treat them hygienically is a very important task in the manure accumulation campaign.

Human and animal waste is the most widely used and highly effective organic fertilizer in agricultural production. Garbage and sewage also contain large amounts of fertilizer. However, this type of fertilizer easily loses its fertility, and it also carries various germs and parasite eggs, which is not conducive to people's health or the development of livestock and poultry. Managing manure, garbage, and sewage well and carrying out harmless treatment can not only accumulate more fertilizer and improve its effectiveness, but also kill germs and parasite eggs, improve environmental sanitation, protect people's health, and ensure the prosperity of livestock. It is beneficial to both production and hygiene, achieving multiple goals at once.

In recent years, many places, starting from production, have combined the manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign with the patriotic health campaign, vigorously promoted environmental sanitation, built and renovated toilets, manure ponds, and manure yards, improved livestock pens, and universally ensured that people have toilets, cattle and horses have pens, pigs and sheep have enclosures, and poultry have nests, greatly improving the environmental sanitation in urban and rural areas and improving people's health. The broad masses of people have gradually developed hygienic habits. Currently, the whole Party and the whole people are enthusiastically responding to the Party's call to run agriculture in a big way and run grain production in a big way. We must adapt to the requirements of this new situation, start from production, further improve environmental sanitation, and strive to ensure that people do not get sick or get sick less often, so that everyone has a strong body and abundant energy to invest in production. Manure, garbage, and sewage contain a large number of germs and parasite eggs. If they are not managed well and treated properly, they will breed a large number of mosquitoes and flies, attract rats, and spread various acute infectious diseases and parasitic diseases, seriously threatening the health of the broad masses of people and the safety of livestock and poultry. Doing a good job in the management of manure, garbage, and sewage, and adopting methods such as mud-sealed composting and three-tank manure storage to carry out harmless treatment of manure and garbage can kill germs and parasite eggs and effectively control the prevalence of various diseases. Quanjiao County in Anhui Province has preliminarily researched and successfully tested a set of comprehensive measures for harmless treatment of manure. According to observation and experiments, the disease-prevention toilets they created have a kill rate of 90% to 100% for parasite eggs such as schistosomiasis, hookworm, and roundworm, and for germs of intestinal infectious diseases such as typhoid and dysentery. In 1958, Cheng Guan Town in Hechuan County, Sichuan Province, applied fertilizer that had undergone harmless treatment to irrigate the land. The hookworm infection rate dropped from 80% to 20%. Since 1959, basically no hookworm infection has been found. This year, basically no intestinal infectious diseases have occurred. These facts are sufficient to show that in order to prevent diseases, protect people's health and the safety of livestock, and ensure the sustained leap forward in production, it is necessary to do a good job in the management and harmless treatment of manure, garbage, and sewage.

The guidance of science and technology plays an important role in carrying out the management and harmless treatment of manure, garbage, and sewage. Health personnel must give full play to their abilities in this work. However, it should be pointed out that health work must be conducive to production and to running agriculture in a big way and running grain production in a big way. Any action that hinders production is wrong. Therefore, the first requirement is for health personnel to establish the idea of "starting from production, cooperating with production, and serving production," basing themselves on existing conditions, adapting to local conditions, keeping things simple, focusing on local resources, and overcoming the one-sided purely technical viewpoint of focusing on hygiene for the sake of hygiene. To achieve this, health personnel are required to combine with Party committees and the masses under the leadership of the Party, be down-to-earth, go deep into the reality of production, absorb the experience of the masses, and summarize and improve it. Under the leadership of the county Party committee, health personnel in Jianning County, Fujian Province, went deep into production teams, ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the masses, understood the production process, summarized the experience of the masses, and worked with old farmers, carpenters, and masons to study and improve toilets, pig pens, and garbage furnaces, exploring a set of reform methods that save materials and are suitable for rural needs. In less than a month, they basically achieved harmless treatment of manure and garbage. It can be seen that as long as health personnel start from production and truly go deep into reality, they will find that the masses have extremely rich experience. Improving the experience of the masses makes it conform to science and meets hygienic requirements. For example, many farmers in some areas of our country have the habit of composting. Health personnel only need to teach them to seal the outside of the compost pile with mud, pay attention to ventilation, and store it for a certain period of time to achieve harmless requirements. This method is simple, easy to implement, easy for the masses to accept, and easy to promote. If health personnel are divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and promote some expensive, laborious, and unfavorable production methods from an isolated hygienic point of view, they will inevitably not be welcomed by the masses. For example, heating fertilizer to above 80 degrees can ensure the killing of germs and parasite eggs. From a one-sided hygienic point of view, it can be said to be hygienic! However, adopting such a method will destroy the fertilizer. Of course, the peasants will definitely not agree to do such a stupid thing.

Strengthening the management of manure, garbage, and sewage and carrying out harmless treatment will inevitably occupy some labor. Some people worry that doing so will affect production? According to research, if toilets and manure ponds are not shaded and covered, more than half of the fertilizer efficiency will be lost after a month. Sun-drying manure will not only waste all the fertilizer in the urine, but also lose 40% of the nitrogen fertilizer in the manure. It can be seen that ignoring the management of manure, garbage, and sewage will bring huge losses to the manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign. In order to ensure increased grain production, Chinese farmers are trying every means to increase fertilizer accumulation. Allowing fertilizer to be lost, reducing fertilizer efficiency, and spreading diseases will waste the hard work of the broad masses of farmers, and the increased fertilizer will be equivalent to no increase, or even a decrease in fertilizer, and will also affect people's health and the safety of livestock. This will greatly affect the sustained leap forward in agricultural production. Doing a good job in the management and harmless treatment of manure, garbage, and sewage can increase fertilizer accumulation and improve fertilizer efficiency, so that some organic substances that cannot be quickly absorbed by crops are decomposed and deteriorated into nutrients that are easily absorbed by plants, so that the same amount of fertilizer used in production can play a multiple role. According to the experiment in Zhecheng County, Henan Province, two cornfields, under the same soil quality, the same amount of fertilizer, and the same management conditions, applying fertilizer that has undergone harmless treatment can increase production by more than two times compared to applying untreated fertilizer. This example shows that strengthening the management of manure, garbage, and sewage and carrying out harmless treatment, although it will occupy some labor, is greatly beneficial to agricultural production increase. In this sense, it is not a waste of labor and affects production, but adds thousands and thousands of living labor forces to the front line of agricultural production, promoting the development of production.

In order to accumulate more good fertilizer to support agricultural production, in order to protect people's health and the safety of livestock, and to enable every labor force to participate in production with vigor and vitality, we must closely combine with the production center, continue to carry out environmental sanitation in a big way, and vigorously grasp the management of human and animal waste, garbage, and sewage, and carry out harmless treatment in a big way. In order to save more labor for agricultural production, it is necessary to widely mobilize the masses and carry out technical innovation and technical revolution movements in a big way, so that the work of cleaning, fetching manure, transporting manure, and harmless treatment will gradually achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization. In order to ensure that this work is done comprehensively and regularly, it is necessary to establish a system and earnestly supervise and inspect it. In areas where the management of manure, garbage, and sewage and harmless treatment have not been carried out well, this winter, we should, like Zhecheng County in Henan Province, Jianning County in Fujian Province, and Quanjiao County in Anhui Province, immediately cultivate key points, conduct experiments, establish models, and make achievements, and use the facts of agricultural production increase to educate the masses. In this way, in the next two or three years, it will be possible to gradually promote it from points to the whole area and make significant achievements.

    积肥运动中一项十分重要的工作
    大办农业，大办粮食的关键之一是大办肥料。冬季正是大搞积肥的季节，如何使人畜粪便、垃圾等肥料积得多，管理得科学，处理得卫生，是积肥运动中的一项十分重要的工作。
    人畜粪便是农业生产上使用最广泛、肥效很高的有机肥料。垃圾和污水，也含有大量肥分。但是，这种肥料容易散失肥分，同时还带有各种病菌和寄生虫卵，不利于人民的健康，也不利于牲畜和家禽的发展。把粪便、垃圾和污水很好地管理起来，并且进行无害化处理，既多积了肥料，提高了肥效，又可以杀灭病菌和寄生虫卵，改善环境卫生，保护人民健康，保障六畜兴旺。既有利于生产，又有利于卫生。一举数得。
    近几年来，许多地方从生产出发，把积肥造肥运动和爱国卫生运动结合起来，大搞环境卫生，大力修造厕所、粪池、粪场，改良牲畜栏圈，普遍做到人有厕所，牛马有栏，猪羊有圈，家禽有窝，大大改善了城乡环境卫生面貌，提高了人民的健康水平，广大人民逐渐养成卫生习惯。当前，全党全民热烈响应党的号召，大办农业，大办粮食。我们必须适应这一新形势的要求，从生产出发，进一步搞好环境卫生，力求保证人们不生病或少生病，使人人都有健强的身体、充沛的精力投入生产。粪便、垃圾和污水中存有大量病菌和寄生虫卵，如果管理不好，处理不当，就会孳生大量蚊蝇，招引老鼠，传播多种急性传染病和寄生虫病，严重地威胁广大人民的健康，严重威胁家畜家禽的安全。而做好粪便、垃圾和污水的管理，采用泥封堆肥、三缸贮粪等办法，对粪便、垃圾进行无害化处理，可以杀灭病菌和寄生虫卵，有效地控制多种疾病的流行。安徽省全椒县初步研究试验成功一套粪便无害化的综合性措施。据观察试验，他们创造的防病厕所，对血吸虫、钩虫、蛔虫等寄生虫卵和伤寒、痢疾等肠道传染病的病菌的杀灭率，达到90％到100％。四川省合川县城关镇1958年施用经过无害化处理的肥料浇地，钩虫病感染率由80％下降到20％；1959年以来，基本上没有发现钩虫病感染；今年基本上没有发生肠道传染病。这些事实足以说明，要预防疾病，保护人民健康和牲畜的安全，保证生产的持续跃进，必须做好粪便、垃圾和污水的管理和无害化处理。
    科学技术的指导，对于开展粪便、垃圾和污水管理和无害化处理，有着重要的作用。卫生人员必须在这一工作中充分发挥自己的能力。但是，应当指出，卫生工作必须有利于生产，有利于大办农业，大办粮食。任何妨碍生产的行动都是不对的。因此，首先要求卫生人员确立“从生产出发，配合生产，为生产服务”的思想，以现有条件为基础，因地制宜，因陋就简，以土为主，克服片面的为卫生而卫生的单纯技术观点。要做到这一点，就要求卫生人员在党的领导下，同党委、群众三结合，踏踏实实，深入生产实际，吸取群众的经验，加以总结提高。福建省建宁县的卫生人员在县委领导下，深入生产队，与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，了解生产过程，总结群众经验，并且和老农、木工、泥水匠一起，研究改良厕所、猪栏、垃圾炉，摸索出一套既节省材料，又适合农村需要的改革办法，不到一个月时间，就基本上做到粪便垃圾无害化处理。可见，只要卫生人员从生产出发，真正深入实际，就会发现群众有着极为丰富的经验，把群众的经验加以提高，使之合乎科学，达到卫生的要求。例如，我国许多地区一带农民都有堆肥的习惯，卫生人员只要教他们在肥堆外面用泥封住，注意通风，并且经过一定时间封存，就能达到无害的要求，这种办法简便易行，易为群众接受，并便于推广。卫生人员如果脱离实际，脱离群众，孤立地从卫生要求出发，推广一些费钱费力而又不利于生产的办法，必然不会受到群众的欢迎。举例说，把肥料加温到80度以上，可以保证杀灭病菌和寄生虫卵，从片面的卫生观点看，可谓卫生矣！然而，采取这样的办法，却会把肥料烧毁。当然，农民是决不同意干这种傻事的。
    加强粪便、垃圾和污水的管理，进行无害化处理，必然要占用一些劳力。有人担心，这样做会不会影响生产？据研究，厕所、粪池不遮荫加盖，经过一个月，肥效要损失一半以上；晒大粪干，不仅尿中的肥分全部浪费，大粪中的氮肥也要失掉40％。可见，忽视粪便、垃圾和污水的管理，将会给积肥造肥运动带来巨大的损失。为了确保粮食增产，我国农民正在千方百计地增积肥料。任凭肥料流失，降低肥效，传染疾病，那么，广大农民的辛勤劳动也就白白浪费了，增加的肥料等于不增加，甚至还减少了肥料，还要影响人们的健康和牲畜的安全，这就会大大影响农业生产的持续跃进。做好粪便、垃圾和污水的管理和无害化处理，可以增积肥料，提高肥效，使一些原来不能被庄稼很快吸收的有机物质，经过腐熟变质，成为易于被植物吸收的营养物质，使同样数量的肥料用于生产，能够发挥成倍的作用。根据河南省柘城县试验，两块玉米地，在同样土质，同量肥料，同样管理的条件下，施用经过无害化处理的肥料，比之施用未经处理的肥料，增产两倍以上。这个例子说明，加强粪便、垃圾和污水的管理，进行无害化处理，虽然要占用一些劳力，然而却大大有利于农业增产。从这个意义上说，不仅不是浪费劳力，影响生产，而且是为农业生产第一线增加了成千成万个活的劳动力，促进了生产的发展。
    为了积造更多的好肥料支援农业生产，为了保护人民健康和牲畜的安全，使每个劳力都能生龙活虎地参加生产，我们必须紧密结合生产中心，继续大搞环境卫生，狠抓人畜粪便、垃圾和污水的管理工作，大搞无害化处理。为了节省出更多的劳力为农业生产服务，必须广泛发动群众，大搞技术革新和技术革命运动，使清扫、取粪、运粪和无害化处理工作，逐步实现机械化和半机械化。为了保证这一工作做得全面、经常，必须建立制度，认真督促检查。尚未很好地进行粪便、垃圾、污水的管理工作和无害化处理的地区，在今年冬季，应该像河南省柘城县、福建省建宁县、安徽省全椒县那样，立即培养重点，进行试验，树立标兵，作出成绩，用农业增产的事实来教育群众。这样，在今后二、三年内就有可能由点逐步推广到面，作出显著的成绩。
