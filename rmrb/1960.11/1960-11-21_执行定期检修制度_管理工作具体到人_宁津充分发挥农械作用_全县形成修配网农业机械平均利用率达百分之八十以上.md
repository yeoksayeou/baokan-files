    (Reported by this newspaper) The CCP Ningjin County Committee in Hebei Province attaches great importance to the maintenance and management of agricultural machinery, enabling the average utilization rate of agricultural machinery to reach over 80%, giving full play to the capacity of existing agricultural machinery equipment.
    Ningjin County's agricultural machinery equipment has been increasing year by year. Strengthening the management, repair and parts supply, and utilization of this agricultural machinery is a very important task. The CCP Ningjin County Committee requires Party organization secretaries at all levels to take the lead, treating the management, repair and parts supply, and good utilization of existing agricultural machinery as a major task in vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. At the same time, specialized management organizations (repair and parts stations, groups) were established from the county to the team level, and county and commune factories were also re-arranged to further implement the production policy of prioritizing repair and parts supply.
    Based on the usage of agricultural machinery, this county also equipped commune repair and parts factories and production team maintenance groups with equipment and personnel, comprehensively carrying out the network establishment of agricultural machinery repair and parts supply, so that the county has initially formed a network of agricultural machinery repair and parts supply that combines large and small facilities. Ningjin County also rationally divided labor based on the technical level and equipment capacity of the repair and parts stations: the county repair and parts factory is responsible for major repairs and the manufacture of more precise parts; the commune factory is responsible for medium repairs of machinery and the production of general parts; and the production team's maintenance group is responsible for machinery maintenance and upkeep. In order to improve the level of repair and parts work and exchange advanced experience in repair and parts work, mechanical repair and parts information stations were established in each of the ten communes in the county, each station equipped with two to three information officers; many production teams and high-yield areas also set up mechanical repair and parts information boxes, forming a mechanical repair and parts information network, promptly understanding the damage situation of mechanical equipment, so that repairs are carried out where needed, ensuring that more than 80% of the county's agricultural machinery is often used normally, and at the same time basically achieving the requirements of "minor repairs do not stop the machine and do not leave the team, medium repairs do not last overnight and do not leave the commune, and major repairs do not last more than three days and do not leave the county."
    In agricultural machinery maintenance work, this county conscientiously implemented the policy of combining routine maintenance with concentrated overhauls, universally strengthened the education of commune members in cherishing agricultural machinery, fully mobilized the masses, established and improved systems for machinery maintenance, management, and use, achieving archival management of machinery, card-based operation, specifically recording the machinery's origin, model, horsepower, purchase year, main components, performance, and specific person in charge; at the same time, daily operation records were strengthened. The benefits of doing this are: clear records, enhancing the driver's sense of responsibility, facilitating the understanding of machinery conditions, and changing the past practice of repairing only when in use and not repairing when not in use, achieving routine machinery maintenance. After Chaihu Dian Commune established and improved agricultural machinery management and maintenance systems, the utilization rate of irrigation and drainage machinery increased to 95%. In order to prevent or minimize machinery failures, it is stipulated that drivers must conduct four checks before driving: "check the amount of lubricating oil, check the machine parts and screws, check the cooling water, and check the fuel"; when driving, they must remain on duty, strictly control the load, listen to the machine's sound, and watch the machine's movement, which gradually reduces machinery damage and increases normal operating time. After Daokou Commune did this, the eighty-seven power-driven machines put into operation have been running normally for half a year.

    执行定期检修制度　管理工作具体到人
    宁津充分发挥农械作用
    全县形成修配网农业机械平均利用率达百分之八十以上
    本报讯　中共河北宁津县委重视农业机械的维护检修和管理工作，使农业机械的利用率平均达到80％以上，充分发挥了现有农业机械设备的能力。
    宁津县的农业机械设备，逐年增加。加强对这些农业机械的管理、修配和使用，是很重要的一项工作。中共宁津县委要求各级党组织书记挂帅，把管理、修配和使用好现有的农业机械当作大办农业、大办粮食工作中的一件大事。同时，从县到队层层建立了专门管理的机构（修配站、组），县、社工厂也都重新作了安排，进一步贯彻了以修配为主的生产方针。
    这个县还根据农业机械的使用情况，从设备到人员，武装了公社修配厂和生产队的维修组，全面进行农业机械修配的建网布点工作，使全县初步形成了一个中、小结合的农业机具修配网。宁津县还根据修配站的技术水平和设备能力，合理进行分工：县修配厂负责大修和制造较精密配件的任务；社厂负责机械中修和一般配件的生产；生产队的维修组负责机械维修和保养工作。为了提高修配工作的水平和交流修配工作中的先进经验，在全县十个公社中，分别建立了机械修配情报站，每站配备情报员二至三人；很多生产队和丰产方还设立了机械修配情报箱，形成一个机械修配情报网，及时了解机械设备的损坏情况，作到坏在哪里，修到哪里，保证全县80％以上的农业机械经常得到正常使用，同时基本上实现了小修不停机、不出队，中修不过夜、不出社，大修不过三天、不出县的要求。
    在农业机械维修工作中，这个县认真贯彻了经常维修和突击检修相结合的方针，在社员中普遍加强了爱护农业机械的教育，充分发动群众，建立和健全了机械的维护、管理、使用等制度，实现了机械管理档案化，作业卡片化，具体记载机械产地、型号、马力、购入年限、主要部件、性能和具体负责人；同时加强了日常操作记录。这样作的好处是：底码清楚，增强司机手的责任心，便于掌握机械情况，并且改变了过去现用现修、不用不修的作法，实现了经常性的机械维修。柴胡店公社建立和健全农业机械管理、维修制度以后，排灌机械的利用率提高到95％。为使机械不发生或少发生故障，规定司机在开车前要进行四查：“查润油多少、查机件和螺丝、查冷却用水、查燃料”；开车时要作到值日不离工作岗位，严格控制负荷，耳听机器响，眼看机器行，这样就使机械损坏现象逐渐减少，增加了正常运转时间。道口公社这样做以后，开动的八十七台动力机械，半年来一直运转正常。
