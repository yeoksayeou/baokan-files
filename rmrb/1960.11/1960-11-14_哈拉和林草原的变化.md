Changes in the Khara Khorin Grassland
By Our Correspondent Feng Ye

    The first water conservancy and irrigation project in Mongolia has been completed on the Khara Khorin Grassland. The large and small canals of this water conservancy project extend for more than 370 kilometers, winding around millions of hectares of farmland. The Khara Khorin Grassland only began reclamation and planting three years ago. This year, for the first time, the land was irrigated with water from the Orkhon River, and abundant grain was produced.
    "Khara Khorin" is the site of an ancient Mongolian city. Three years ago, the "Khara Khorin Agricultural and Pastoral Farm" was established on the great grassland of the city site. Over the years, we have visited the farm several times, and each time we have a new feeling. The farm is developing rapidly, and its changes and development have left us with a deep impression.
    In the summer of 1957, when the farm was newly established and the seeds were first sown on the newly reclaimed land, we came to the farm. At that time, there were only a few temporary tents and yurts. The farm manager told us that it was a new farm, with new employees, but people started the first battle to conquer the wasteland on the grassland with infinite hope, planting crops on more than 3,000 hectares of land. At the beginning of the farm, there were few people and little cultivated land. Overlooking tens of thousands of hectares of wilderness, it was vast and boundless. From this rich land, we saw its broad prospects for development.
    During the autumn harvest in 1958, we visited the farm for the second time. In more than a year, the farm has developed greatly. The seeds sown by the hard work of the farm workers grew into wheat seedlings taller than people. The workers celebrated the harvest. Shortly before our visit to the farm, Chinese water conservancy engineers came to Khara Khorin. According to the agreement between the Chinese and Mongolian governments, they were helping the farm to build a huge water conservancy and irrigation project. At that time, Chinese water conservancy engineers were conducting survey work here. We once saw the design blueprint of this irrigation project. We saw large and small channels crisscrossing each other on the map, as dense as a spider web, which was a complex task.
    This spring, during the spring plowing and sowing season, we visited Khara Khorin again. Only a year and a half had passed, but the appearance of the farm had changed so much that we could hardly recognize it.
    The cultivated area of the farm has been greatly expanded. The original large grassland took off its green clothes, exposing the dark brown soil. This year, a total of 20,000 hectares of cultivated land have been reclaimed. Except for 5,000 hectares of fallow land, improved seeds have been sown on 15,000 hectares of land.
    Part of the water conservancy and irrigation blueprint we saw in the farm office a year and a half ago has become a reality. The channel project was officially started last year. In the past year, 580,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed, and channels with a total length of more than 110 kilometers have been built. At the same time, a dam and two sluice gates have been built on the Orkhon River. A hydroelectric power station has been selected and partial construction has begun.
    In the center of the farm, where we once lived in yurts in 1957, dozens of houses have been built. There are offices, medical clinics, canteens, red entertainment rooms and some staff dormitories. The flour processing plant built with Hungarian assistance is under construction. After the factory is completed, it will process and produce 12,000 tons of flour annually. How different is all this from what we saw three years ago. Mongolian comrades told us that Khara Khorin will gradually develop into a new socialist city.
    We warmly congratulate the rapid development of the farm. Farm Manager Pulbu said, "Our farm, like China, is developing in a great leap forward." When the farm was established, only fourteen people came here. Now there are more than 800 employees, and with their families, there are more than 2,000 people. In 1957, the farm harvested more than 20,000 quintals of grain from the newly reclaimed land for the first time. By 1959, it harvested more than 170,000 quintals of grain. Because the farm has completed its production tasks well and achieved good harvests for three years, it has been rewarded by the state for three years. In 1959, it won the "Polar Star" Medal.
    In production, many advanced producers have emerged. Mongolia's first agricultural and pastoral "Socialist Labor Team" was won by a production team of this farm. The farm manager introduced us to visit this production team.
    Crossing the Orkhon River and over a small hill, a new reclaimed land appeared in front of us. On one side of the new reclaimed land, more than 20 yurts were neatly arranged on the grassland, which is the center of the production team.
    Young Captain Darza enthusiastically introduced the situation of the production team to us. This "Socialist Labor Team" has a total of 15 members, all young people aged 19 to 27. Last year, after they proposed the task of striving to become a "Socialist Labor Team", they demanded to improve in accordance with socialist methods in work, study and life. They learned from each other, cooperated with each other, and everyone skillfully mastered the technology, thus improving work efficiency and overfulfilling the production tasks of spring plowing, summer tilling and autumn harvest. They organized study groups and studied political theory and culture according to plan. Now, the team members have an average cultural level of three or four years, and they require to reach the level of seven years in the near future. In terms of life, they pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, organize collective recreational activities, so that everyone develops good civilized habits. This year, the production team is shouldering the glorious task of reclaiming and producing on the north bank of the Orkhon River, and has completed the spring plowing and sowing plan ahead of schedule, sowing seeds on 4,000 hectares of land. The production team is preparing to build houses on this cultivated land and establish a settled center.
    Several months have passed. At the end of September this year, when the water conservancy project was handed over, we came to the Khara Khorin water conservancy project site. The grain sown in the spring has matured and harvested. The unfinished projects of the Khara Khorin water conservancy irrigation channel have been completed. The hydroelectric power station has been built, and Khara Khorin has been brightly lit. The flour mill has also been installed and produced the first batch of flour.
    The Orkhon River is a large river in Mongolia. The river water is clear. For many years, it has been flowing from this side of the grassland to the other. Now, it is intercepted by people in Khara Khorin and used to serve production. The water conservancy and irrigation project can use the Orkhon River water to irrigate more than 8,000 hectares of cultivated land for the farm; it can also use hydropower to serve the industrial production of the farm.
    The farm manager told us that in the later stage of wheat production this year, the farm used channel water to irrigate a part of the wheat land on a trial basis, and the effect was very good. The farm estimates that the average yield of wheat per hectare this year is 13 quintals, but the wheat land irrigated by channel water harvested 20 quintals per hectare.
    The completion of the Khara Khorin water conservancy and irrigation project is another crystallization of the profound friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian people. Farm Manager Pulbu gave a high evaluation to the Chinese people's help in building this project for the farm. He said that we saw the brotherhood of the people of the two countries from the tenacious labor of the Chinese workers. He also introduced to us the moving examples of mutual help and support between Chinese and Mongolian workers in production labor.
    When Chinese workers first arrived at the Khara Khorin Grassland, they were warmly received and enthusiastically helped by the farm workers. Chinese workers did not know how to build yurts, and Mongolian workers helped them build them. The farm's tractors are often lent to Chinese workers when they are free. When the severe winter came last year, the families of Mongolian workers cared about the workers from southern China, fearing that they would freeze, and volunteered to sew cotton clothes for the Chinese workers. The enthusiastic help of the Mongolian workers further inspired the labor enthusiasm of the Chinese workers.
    Last summer, a river on the Khara Khorin Grassland rose, and there was a danger of flooding. The news spread to the Chinese construction site in the middle of the night. The Chinese workers carried tools and immediately rushed to the place where the breach was about to occur, and jumped into the water to repair the dikes regardless of their own safety. The farm manager said that the Chinese and Mongolian workers were closely united and fought the flood all night, and finally saved the dikes and protected the crops on the grassland from being inundated. In addition, during the busy autumn harvest season of the farm, Chinese workers often helped with harvesting and loading and unloading grain in their spare time.
    For more than a year, the workers of the two countries have supported each other in labor in this way and forged a closer friendship. This friendship will blossom and bear fruit on the Mongolian grassland. (Attached picture)

    哈拉和林草原的变化
    本报记者　逢烨
    在哈拉和林草原上，蒙古的第一个水利灌溉工程完工了。这个水利工程的大小渠道长达三百七十多公里，弯弯曲曲地围绕着千万公顷农田。哈拉和林草原是在三年前才开始垦荒种植的，今年第一次利用阿尔浑河河水浇灌土地，长出了丰硕的粮食。
    “哈拉和林”是蒙古古城的旧址。三年前，“哈拉和林农牧场”在城址的大草原上建立起来了。几年来，我们曾经好几次到农牧场参观访问，每去一次，都有新的感觉。农牧场在飞快地发展着，它的变化、发展，给我们留下很深的印象。
    1957年夏天，农牧场建立不久，在新垦地上第一次撒上种子的时候，我们来到农牧场。那时，这里只有几个临时的帐篷和蒙古包。场长告诉我们，新农场，新职工，但人们怀着无限的希望，在草原上开始了征服荒地的第一个战役，在三千多公顷土地上种上了庄稼。农牧场初创，人少耕地少，眺望几万公顷原野，空旷无垠。从这块富饶的土地上，我们看到了它的广阔的发展前景。
    在1958年秋收的日子，我们第二次去农牧场参观。一年多的时间，农牧场大大发展了。农牧场职工辛勤劳动播下的种子，长出的麦苗比人高。职工们欢庆获得了丰收。就在我们去农牧场的早些日子，中国水利工程人员来到哈拉和林。他们根据中、蒙两国政府协定，在哈拉和林帮助农牧场修建一项巨大的水利灌溉工程。当时，中国水利工程技术人员正在这里进行勘测工作。我们曾经看了这项灌溉工程的设计蓝图，只见图上大小渠道纵横交错，密如蛛网，是一项复杂的工作。
    今年春天，在春耕播种的日子，我们又一次访问了哈拉和林。时间只过了一年半，而农牧场的面貌已经变化得使我们几乎辨认不出来了。
    农牧场的耕地面积大大扩展了。原来的大片草原，脱去绿色的衣装，裸露出黑褐色的泥土。今年共开垦了两万公顷耕地，除五千公顷休耕地外，已在一万五千公顷土地上播上了优良的种籽。
    一年半前在农牧场办公室看到的水利灌溉蓝图，已有一部分变成了现实。渠道工程是在去年正式施工的，一年来完成了五十八万土方工程，修成长达一百一十多公里的渠道，同时还在阿尔浑河上修筑了一个水坝和两个水闸。一个水力发电站已经选择好了地址，并且开始了部分工程。
    在农牧场中心，1957年我们曾经住过的搭着蒙古包的地方，已盖起了几十间房屋。这里有办公室、医疗所、食堂、红色娱乐室和部分职工宿舍。匈牙利帮助兴修的面粉加工厂正在施工，这所工厂建成后，每年将加工生产一万二千吨面粉。这一切，和三年前我们看到的情景多么不同啊。蒙古同志告诉我们，哈拉和林将逐渐发展成为一座社会主义的新城市。
    我们热烈祝贺农牧场的迅速发展。农牧场场长普尔布同志说：“我们这个场子，就像中国那样，在跃进地发展着。”建场的时候，这里只来了十四个人，现在已经有八百多名职工，连同家属达到两千多人了。1957年，农牧场第一次从新垦地上收获了两万多公担粮食，到1959年就收获了十七万多公担谷物。由于农牧场三年来都很好地完成了生产任务，得到了丰收，因此三年都得到国家的奖励。1959年获得“北极星”勋章。
    在生产中，涌现了不少先进生产者。蒙古第一个农牧业“社会主义劳动队”就是由这个农牧场的一个生产队获得的。场长介绍我们去访问了这个生产队。
    越过阿尔浑河，翻过一个小山丘，一片新垦地呈现在我们眼前。在新垦地的一边，二十多个蒙古包整齐地排列在草原上，那就是生产队的中心。
    年青的队长达尔扎同志热情地向我们介绍了生产队的情况。这个“社会主义劳动队”一共十五名队员，都是十九岁到二十七岁的青年。去年，他们提出争取成为“社会主义劳动队”的任务以后，无论在工作、学习和生活方面，都要求按社会主义方式提高一步。他们相互学习，相互协作，人人熟练地掌握了技术，因此提高了工作效率，超额完成春耕播种、夏季翻地和秋收的生产任务。他们组织了学习小组，根据计划学习政治理论和文化。现在，队员们平均达到了三、四年级的文化水平，要求在近几年内达到七年级的水平。生活方面，讲究清洁卫生，组织集体的文娱活动，使大家养成文明的良好习惯。今年，生产队担负着在阿尔浑河北岸垦荒生产的光荣任务，提前完成了春耕播种计划，在四千公顷土地上播了种。生产队准备就在这片耕地上修建房屋，建立定居的中心。
    时间又过了几个月。今年九月底，在水利工程交接的时候，我们来到哈拉和林水利工程工地。春天播种的谷物已经成熟收割了。哈拉和林水利灌溉渠道的未完工程已经全部完工了。水力发电站修建起来了，哈拉和林已经大放光明。面粉厂也安装完毕，生产了第一批面粉。
    阿尔浑河是蒙古的一条大河，河水清澈，多少年来，它一直从草原的这边流向另一边。现在，它在哈拉和林被人们截住，用来为生产服务了。水利灌溉工程可以利用阿尔浑河水，为农牧场灌溉八千多公顷耕地；还可以利用水力发电，为农牧场的工业生产服务。
    场长告诉我们，在今年小麦生产后期，农牧场利用渠道水试灌溉了一部分小麦地，效果很好。农牧场估计今年平均每公顷可收小麦十三公担，但是，经过渠水灌溉的小麦地，每公顷收获了二十公担。
    哈拉和林水利灌溉工程的修建完工，是中蒙两国人民深厚友谊的又一结晶。普尔布场长对于中国人民帮助农牧场修建这个工程，给予很高的评价。他说，我们从中国工人顽强的劳动中，看到两国人民的兄弟合作的情谊。他还向我们介绍了中蒙两国工人在生产劳动中相互帮助、相互支援的动人事例。
    中国工人初到哈拉和林草原的时候，就受到农场职工的殷勤接待和热情帮助。中国工人不会搭蒙古包，蒙古工人就帮助他们搭。农牧场的拖拉机在休闲的时候，常借给中国工人使用。去年严冬到来，蒙古职工的家属关怀来自中国南方的工人，怕他们受冻，自愿要求为中国工人缝棉衣。蒙古工人的热情帮助，更加鼓舞了中国工人的劳动热情。
    去年夏天，哈拉和林草原上的一条河水涨，有泛滥成灾的危险。这个消息在深夜传到了中国工地，中国工人们携带工具，立即赶到快要决口的地方，奋不顾身地跳进水里，抢修堤埂。场长说，中、蒙两国工人亲密团结，和洪水搏斗了一夜，终于保住堤埂，保住了草原上的庄稼没有受到浸害。另外，在农牧场繁忙的秋收季节，中国工人还常常在工余之暇，到场里帮助收割和装卸粮食。
    一年多来，两国工人就是这样在劳动中互相支援，结成了更加亲密的友谊。这个友谊，将在蒙古草原上开花结果。（附图片）
