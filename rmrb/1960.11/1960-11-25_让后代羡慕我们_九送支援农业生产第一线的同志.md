    Let Future Generations Envy Us
    —Seeing Off Comrades Supporting the Agricultural Production Front for the Ninth Time
    Ge Song
    There’s a line in the Soviet film "On the Wild River Bank":
    Vakulin: "I really envy our descendants; they will see a bright sky."
    Fagima: "I don't envy them. They will live in a communist society, but we are building it."
    Malarov: "Exactly, Fagima, let our descendants envy us!"
    This dialogue is meaningful and thought-provoking.
    Just thinking about how our next generation will live in an ideal communist society, how could this generation not envy that bright and wonderful life? If we think back, our generation lives in the era of building socialism, which is exactly what the previous generation dreamed of and longed for. Compared with the previous generation who lived under the pressure of the three great mountains, our lives are naturally enviable. However, without the hard work of the previous generation, where would our happiness come from?
    Our predecessors, unafraid of bloodshed and sacrifice, fearlessly moved away the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, winning for us a happy world without exploitation or oppression, and opening up a road to communism. This is precisely the case of the predecessors planting trees for the later generations to enjoy the shade. Is there anyone more worthy of envy than those who work hard to create a happy life for the next generation? Thinking this way, it is not those who enjoy happiness who are worthy of envy, but rather the revolutionary predecessors who created happiness for us.
    Envy the fearless and sacrificial spirit of our older generation who cleared the way for us through thorns, and let us also learn from their noble qualities, bravely take over the torch of revolution, and continue running. Sow the seeds of happiness for the next generation, and let the next generation also envy us.
    Happiness has never been obtained by sitting and waiting, nor can it be achieved in a day or two. It requires hard work, struggle, and time. Our previous generation has already moved away the three great mountains. In front of us, there are still the two great mountains of "poverty" and "blankness." This is precisely the task entrusted to us by the era. Our generation is just as fearless and brave as our predecessors, rushing to go to difficult places, to the struggle, rushing to remove the two great mountains of "poverty and blankness," so that we ourselves and the next generation can live more happily and advance on a broader road. Bearing such a glorious task of the times, how can this generation not be jubilant, excited, and proud?
    Each of our generations enjoys the results of the hard struggle of the previous generation, and each generation continues to struggle hard for the next generation. Only through continuous revolution can the lives of each generation become better and better. Let the later generations forever envy the labor and struggle of the previous generation. The struggle is endless, and our happiness is also endless!

    让后代羡慕我们
    ——九送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    苏联电影《在荒凉的河岸上》有这样一段对话：
    瓦库林：“我真羡慕我们的子孙后代，他们将看到灿烂的天空。”
    法吉玛：“我不羡慕他们。他们将生活在共产主义社会，但是我们在建设它。”
    马拉洛夫：“对呀，法吉玛，让我们的后代来羡慕我们！”
    这一段对话，意味深长，发人深思。
    只要一想到我们的下一代将生活在理想的共产主义社会里，这一代人怎不会对那灿烂美好的生活羡慕不已呢？如果再回头想一想，我们这一代人生活在建设社会主义的今天，又正是上一代人所梦寐以求，心向往之的。和被压在三座大山下生活的上一代比起来，我们的生活自然是值得羡慕的。可是，如果没有上一代人的艰苦奋斗，我们的幸福又从何而来？
    我们的前辈不怕流血牺牲，不畏艰险地搬开了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山，为我们争得了一个没有剥削，没有压迫的幸福天地，为我们开辟了一条通往共产主义的大道。这正是前人栽树，后人乘凉。难道还有比自己千辛万苦而为下一代人创造幸福生活的人更值得人们称羡的吗？这样一想，值得羡慕的不是享受幸福的人，却是为我们谛造幸福的革命前辈了。
    羡慕我们老一代的不畏艰险，不怕牺牲地为我们披荆斩棘开路的精神吧，让我们也学习他们这种崇高的品质，勇敢地接过革命的火炬，继续跑下去。把幸福种子撒播给后一代，让后一代也来羡慕我们。
    幸福从来不是靠坐着等来的，也不是一天两天即可到手的，这要靠艰苦的劳动，要靠斗争，要靠时间。我们的上一代已经搬走了三座大山，在我们的面前还有
  “穷”和“白”两座大山，这正是时代付予我们的任务，我们这一代也正如前辈一样地无畏和勇敢，抢着到艰苦的地方去，到斗争中去，抢着要搬掉“一穷二白”的两座大山，好让我们自己和下一代能更幸福的生活，能在更加广阔的路上前进。背负起这样光荣的时代的任务，怎不令这一代人欢欣鼓舞，兴奋自豪呢？
    我们每一代人都享受到上一代艰苦斗争的结果，每一代人都为下一代而继续艰苦斗争。只有不断革命，一代代的生活才愈过愈美好。让后一代永远羡慕上一代人的劳动和斗争吧。斗争无止境，我们的幸福亦无止境！
