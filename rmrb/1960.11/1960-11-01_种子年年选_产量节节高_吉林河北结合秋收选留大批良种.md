Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Jilin Province is extensively carrying out a mass movement to select and retain improved varieties during the autumn harvest. According to preliminary statistics as of October 20th, the province has selected more than 370 million jin of various autumn crop seeds, including corn, soybeans, rice, sorghum, and millet. The purity of the seeds is all above 90%.

People's communes, adhering to the principle of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, self-use, supplemented by necessary adjustments," built large seed bases and strengthened seed breeding work during the spring plowing season. People's communes in the province established a total of 410 improved seed breeding farms, and 210,000 hectares of seed fields, and accordingly formed more than 3,200 improved seed breeding professional teams, basically realizing that every commune has a farm and every team has a base, which laid a good foundation for the fine selection of improved varieties.

Since the autumn harvest began in late September, a mass movement for selecting and retaining improved varieties has been launched in various places. Twenty-six counties, including Yushu and Dehui, organized more than 20,000 seed selection professional groups, established a responsibility system with fixed personnel, fixed leadership, fixed quantity, and fixed quality, making the seed selection work proceed in an orderly manner. According to statistics from more than 20 counties including Da'an, a total of 130,000 people participated in the seed selection activities.

This year, some areas suffered from insufficient improved varieties due to disasters. When selecting and retaining seeds, they fully promoted the spirit of cooperation, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies and exchanging improved varieties between teams, communes, and counties.

While continuing to seize the selection of sufficient and good improved varieties, all localities paid early attention to the drying and storage of seeds. According to incomplete statistics, more than 7,300 seed warehouses have been built throughout the province, and the system of special personnel responsible for storage in special warehouses has been universally implemented.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Hebei has mobilized the masses to select and retain a large number of improved varieties during the autumn harvest.

This year, in accordance with the principle of "self-breeding, self-selection, self-retention, self-use," various localities have universally established improved seed breeding bases for various crops such as corn, millet, sorghum, sweet potatoes, cotton, and peanuts, providing favorable conditions for seed selection and retention work. In Qinglong County, various communes organized more than 2,000 professional teams to adopt the method of selecting plots and individual plants in the fields and selecting ears on the threshing ground in the 96,000-plus mu of improved seed base. By mid-October, they had selected more than 500,000 jin of fine varieties of millet, corn, etc.

In the seed selection process, all localities prominently focused on the selection and retention of sweet potato seedlings, a high-yield crop. In addition to adopting the "three-way combination" method of cadres, technicians, and commune members to form a professional team for harvesting, digging, storing, and managing sweet potato seedlings, they also universally established a "four-way joint responsibility system" of mutual inspection and supervision for selecting land, harvesting, digging, hauling, and entering cellars, making the seed selection work proceed quickly and well.

In order to manage the selected seeds well, the production teams of people's communes in various localities have implemented the method of storing them in special warehouses and managing them by special personnel, and stipulated a system of regular inspection and temperature measurement.

Shuangta Commune in Minquan County Leaves Enough Peanut Improved Varieties at One Time

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Shuangta Commune, a key peanut-producing area in Henan Province, has comprehensively carried out seed selection activities such as determining plots by square, selecting good plants from plots, selecting good fruits from plants, early harvesting and digging, single harvesting and drying, and storing in separate warehouses, starting early and retaining sufficient peanut seeds at one time. At present, the commune has put more than 1.73 million jin of improved varieties into storage.

In order to grasp the peanut selection and retention work well, the four secretaries of the commune party committee went deep into the foamy sand, alkaline sand, and clear sand areas respectively, and together with cadres, old peasants, and technicians, selected three relatively good varieties through comparison of different soil types, varieties, and yield-increasing effects: "Mao Da Lu," upright variety, and basin-shaped peanuts. At the same time, the commune party committee put forward seed selection requirements based on the area of different soil types in the next year's planting plan. (Attached picture)

    种子年年选　产量节节高
    吉林河北结合秋收选留大批良种
    据新华社讯　吉林省在秋收期间广泛开展选留良种群众运动。截至10月20日的初步统计，全省已选出玉米、大豆、水稻、高粱、谷子等各种大秋作物种子三亿七千多万斤。种子纯度都在90％以上。
    各人民公社本着“自繁、自选、自留、自用，辅之以必要的调剂”的方针，在春耕期间就大建种子基地，加强种子繁育工作。全省农村人民公社共建立良种繁育场四百一十处，种子田二十一万多公顷，并相应成立三千二百多个良种繁育专业队，基本上实现了社社有场、队队有基地，这就为精选良种奠定了良好基础。
    从9月下旬秋收开始，各地就掀起了群众性的选留良种运动。榆树、德惠等二十六县共组织二万多个选种专业组，建立定人员、定领导、定数量、定质量的责任制度，使选种工作进行得井井有条。另据大安等二十多个县的统计，共有十三万人参加了选种活动。
    今年部分地区因受灾良种不足，在选留种子时，充分发扬协作精神，队与队、社与社、县与县之间调剂有无，串换良种。
    各地在继续抓紧选足选好优良品种的同时，及早注意了种子的晾晒、保管工作。据不完全统计，全省已修建种子仓库七千三百多间，普遍地实行专人负责，专仓保管。
    据新华社讯　河北在秋收中，发动群众选留了大批良种。
    今年，各地根据“自繁、自选、自留、自用”的方针，普遍建立了玉米、谷子、高粱、甘薯、棉花、花生等各种作物良种繁育基地，给选种留种工作提供了有利条件。青龙县各公社组织起两千多个专业队，在九万六千多亩良种基地上采取田间选片选棵、场上选穗的办法，到10月中旬已选出谷子、玉米等优良品种五十多万斤。
    在选种中，各地突出地抓住了高产作物甘薯薯种的选留工作，除了采取干部、技术员和社员三结合的方法，组成收刨、储藏、保管薯种专业队外，还普遍建立了选地、收刨、拉运、入窖等互相检查监督的“四联责任制”，使选种工作进行得既快又好。
    为了把选留的种子管好，各地人民公社生产队都实行了专库存放、专人保管的办法，规定了定期检查、验温制度。
    双塔公社花生良种一次留足
    据新华社讯　河南省花生重点产区民权县双塔公社全面开展以方定块、块挑好棵、棵选好果、早出刨、单收晒、分仓保管的选种活动，及早动手，一次把花生种子留足留够。目前，全社已上囤良种一百七十三万多斤。
    为了抓好花生选种、留种工作，公社党委四个书记分别深入泡沙、碱沙、清沙地区，和干部、老农、技术员一起，通过不同土质、品种和增产效果的对比，选出三种比较好的品种：“毛大路”、直立种、盆形花生。同时，公社党委根据明年播种计划中不同土质的面积，分别提出了选种要求。（附图片）
