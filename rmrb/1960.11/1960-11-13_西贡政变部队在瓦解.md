Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 12th: According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency, two days after the coup in Saigon, the South Vietnamese Army forces led by Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Chanh Thi, who participated in the coup, are disintegrating under the counterattack of forces loyal to Ngo Dinh Diem.

    The coup forces still occupy some areas in Saigon and are fighting Ngo Dinh Diem in small groups.

    The coup forces had formed a so-called "Revolutionary Committee." Phan Quang Dan, the political advisor to this committee, said that the "committee" will "struggle against communism" and "stand with the 'free world' headed by American imperialism."

    According to observers here, the Saigon coup has failed, mainly because it did not rely on the people. Its anti-communist and pro-American slogans did not receive the support of the people.

    西贡政变部队在瓦解
  新华社河内12日电　据越南通讯社报道，在西贡发生政变的两天之后，以阮正诗陆军上校为首的参加政变的越南南方陆军部队，在站在吴庭艳一边的部队的反攻之下，正在瓦解。
    参加政变的部队目前仍然在西贡占领若干地方，并分成小批来同吴庭艳进行战斗。
    参加政变的部队曾组成所谓“革命委员会”。这个委员会的政治顾问潘光诞曾说：“委员会”将“为反共而斗争”，并同以美帝国主义为首的“自由世界站在一起。”
    据此间观察家们说，西贡的政变已告失败，失败的主要原因是因为它不依靠人民。它的反共和亲美的口号得不到人民的支持。
