    On the "Roof of the World"
    By our reporter Song Zhenghou
    The Pamir Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World," is located in the westernmost part of our country, bordered by the vast Tarim Basin to the east, the Tianshan Mountains to the northeast, and the Kyrgyz and Tajik Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union to the northwest. Many famous mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas, the Ladakh Range, the Gangdise Mountains, the Karakoram Mountains, and the Kunlun Mountains, converge here. There are countless rivers, large and small. In the past, every summer and autumn, mountain torrents would erupt, and these rivers would become like wild horses, rampaging and completely cutting off transportation on the plateau. Today, as we travel on the plateau, even though it is the autumn season of mountain torrents, the roads extend in all directions, and sturdy bridges span the rivers, large and small, allowing cars to travel unimpeded. A young Kyrgyz man traveling with us said, "If this were before liberation, you would have been unable to move an inch!"
    The Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture was established in the autumn of 1954. In these short few years, the changes on the plateau have been so great that it is almost unimaginable to those who have not experienced them firsthand. Not to mention the countless rapidly developing villages, not to mention the thousands of miles of lush pastures, even the newly emerged towns are astonishing. Some towns are so young that they have not yet had time to acquire a suitable name.
    It was a pitch-black night, and we were rushing through the central part of the plateau. The car passed through a canyon, climbed over a mountain ridge, and suddenly a bustling city appeared before us. The streets were brightly lit, and countless lights resembled a sky full of stars, illuminating the valley. On the bank of a small river, a hydroelectric power station was singing rhythmically, and together with the blasting sounds from the distant mines, it formed a moving symphony. The entire city was interwoven with a chapter of labor.
    The next day, as the east was just beginning to dawn, I stood on a building platform, looking around the mountain city. This young city was not small in scale, stretching for several miles, surrounded by mountains. A small river ran through the center, and the banks were lined with shops, schools, hospitals, clubs, and dormitories. The main street extended to the mountainsides on both sides, shaded by green trees, clean and tidy.
    In autumn, the Pamir grasslands stretch for thousands of miles, with fat sheep and strong horses. In countless river valleys and small plains, commune members are busy harvesting crops. We came to a people's commune called "Toyun," which is located close to the Soviet border. This is one of the best pastures on the plateau, with 100,000 head of livestock grazing here. The Kyrgyz people call this place "Toyun," which means "a place where you can eat your fill." It has only been two years since the establishment of the people's commune here, and the total number of livestock this year has increased by more than 65% compared to 1958. Feed bases and artificial insemination stations have also been established on the grasslands. Various mowing and shearing machines have replaced the old scythes and scissors. The entire commune has five production brigades and nineteen production teams, totaling 2,861 people. This year, 11,132 mu of land were cultivated, yielding 1.3 million jin of grain and more than 15,000 jin of oilseeds. The area has been expanded by 5,516 mu compared to last year, and the total grain and oil production has more than doubled compared to last year. On the grassland next to the commune, a group of shepherd girls are singing happily:
        On the green grasslands,
        We are skilled shepherds;
        In the golden fields,
        We are good farmers;
        The Kyrgyz people ride their steeds,
        Carrying the happiness of the people's commune to the distance.
    I had heard that the Kyrgyz people are warm and hospitable. We came to the Toyun Brigade, the westernmost part of the Toyun Commune. As soon as we got out of the car, two Kyrgyz youths ran up to greet us, shaking hands and patting shoulders as if we were old friends.
    One of these young men was Yasheng, the party branch secretary of the brigade in charge of animal husbandry, who was only thirty years old. Because he had herded sheep for the herdsman's family since childhood, wrinkles that did not match his age had already appeared on his dark face. The other was Maimaiti, an incoming high school graduate who was here for summer vacation. He was only seventeen years old, and in a few days, he would be entering Xinjiang University as the first generation of Kyrgyz college students.
    Because the herds had already been transferred to the autumn pasture, we had to stay temporarily in the tent of the milk factory that had not yet been transferred. These were two conical yurts made of felt, located on the bank of a small river. Not far from the tent was the open-air milk factory with more than 200 dairy cows and mares. In the milk factory, a group of short-bodied, long-haired yaks resembling lions were chasing and playing with each other. Kyrgyz women in colorful shirts and skirts were waving their nimble hands, squeezing the mare's milk that resembled a fountain. The factory director, Suleiman, came over to introduce the production situation of the milk factory to us. He said that in these days of abundant grass, the milk factory could produce at least nearly a thousand jin of milk juice a day. In addition to supplying several canteens in the brigade, these milk juices can also be processed into various dairy products and sold to the state in large quantities. He took us to a tent for storing dairy products, opened the door curtain, and the aroma of milk filled the air. Inside were basins of cream, boxes of sour milk curds, and many leather bags filled with mare's milk hanging on the tent poles.
    After visiting the storage, we came to the tent. The hostess stepped forward and gently lifted the door curtain. Inside, there was a long wooden frame placed horizontally, and exquisite large wooden boxes were placed on the frame. In front of the frame were several flower rugs, which, according to Kyrgyz custom, were sleeping places for entertaining guests. During the day, this sleeping place served as seats for guests. In the center of the tent was the place for cooking, with a small pit dug, on which a triangular pot rack was placed. Now, the host was busy here preparing the most precious food for us—boiled hand-grabbed mutton.
    The hostess brought a kettle and gently sprinkled water on our hands three times for washing, which was the etiquette before meals. Then, cream, milk tea, cream pancakes, cream fried cakes, and hand-grabbed mutton were placed on a felt surface, one plate after another. The branch secretary also became active at this time, offering wine and meat, and according to their traditional etiquette, he always said a long, poetic blessing to the guests before offering wine. The enthusiastic host slowly changed from speaking to singing, the Komuz was plucked, and the singing rang out:
        Chairman Mao is the sun,
        He has turned the grasslands green,
        He has illuminated the mountains;
        The horses are galloping,
        The sheep are singing,
        The sun shines in our hearts;
        We are prosperous and our livestock are also prosperous.
    Night was slowly falling, the herds had returned to their pens, and clusters of bonfires began to appear on the vast grasslands. People were chatting and laughing around the bonfires. Hunters in twos and threes, riding horses with guns on their backs, patrolled around the herds. The autumn pastures are lush with water and grass, which is a great season for grazing, but it is also a time when wolves often come out to harm the herds. Therefore, each brigade has organized several good hunters to specifically guard the herds. In Xinjiang, many Kyrgyz people are skilled hunters. The old hunter Yiming·Bayishali is a very good one. Since liberation, not counting other wild animals he has killed, he has killed more than a hundred vicious wolves. Once, he went up the mountain to check the placed iron clamps and found a wolf trapped, but there were fourteen vicious wolves guarding it. When this pack of wolves spotted him, they pounced fiercely from all directions. He calmly fought the wolves, repelled their counterattack, and even killed a large wolf.
    The night was deep, and the flickering bonfires brought sleepiness to the people. The laughter and talking stopped, and everyone entered a sweet sleep. Only the hunters in twos and threes were still vigilantly guarding the herds in the dark night. (Attached picture)

    在“世界屋脊”上
    本报记者　宋政厚
    号称“世界屋脊”的帕米尔高原，位于我国最西部，东面是浩瀚的塔里木盆地，东北面是天山山脉，西北与苏联吉尔吉斯和塔吉克两个加盟共和国接壤。许多著名的山脉，如喜马拉雅山、拉达克山、冈底斯山、喀喇昆仑山和昆仑山等，都结聚在这里。这里，有数不清的大小河流，过去，每年夏秋，山洪暴发，这些河流全像脱缰野马，横冲直闯，高原上的交通就完全断绝。今天，我们在高原上旅行，虽然正碰上山洪暴发的秋天，可是公路四通八达，大小河流上都架有牢固的桥梁，汽车还是畅行无阻。同行的一位柯尔克孜族青年说：“如果在解放以前，碰上这种时候，你们早就寸步难行了！”
    克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州是在1954年秋季成立的。在这短短的几年中，高原上究竟起了多大的变化，如果不是身临其境的人，对好些事情简直是难以想像，不用说那迅速发展起来的数不尽的农村，不用说那绵延千里的丰茂的牧场，就是一些新出现的城镇，也令人惊叹不已。有些城镇年青得还来不及起一个适合的名字。
    那是一个漆黑的晚上，我们正在高原中部急忙忙地赶路，汽车穿过一道峡谷，翻过一座山梁，眼前突然涌现一座热闹的城市。大街上灯火辉煌，无数盏明灯宛如满天星斗，把山谷照得雪亮。在一条小河岸边，一座水力发电站正有节奏地歌唱着，和那远处采矿的爆破声，组成一支动人的交响乐。整个城市都交织在一种劳动的乐章中。
    第二天，东方刚刚发白，我站在一座楼台上，环视山城四周。这座年青的城市规模不小，纵横有好几里，周围群山环抱，横贯中央的是一条小河，两岸摆满了商店、学校、医院、俱乐部和宿舍等，大街一直伸延到两边山腰，绿树成荫，清洁整齐。
    秋天，帕米尔草原千里，羊肥马壮。在无数的河谷小平原上，社员们正忙着收割庄稼。我们来到紧靠苏联边境的一个叫“托云”的人民公社。这是高原上最好的牧场之一，有十万头牲畜在这里放牧。柯尔克孜人称这里为“托云”，意思是“吃得饱的地方”。这里，建立起人民公社不过两年，今年的牲畜总头数就比1958年增加65％以上。草原上也建立起了饲料基地和人工授精站，各种打草、剪毛的机械，代替了过去的镰刀和剪子。全社有五个生产大队，十九个生产小队，共二千八百六十一人。今年种地一万一千一百三十二亩，收粮食一百三十万斤，收油料一万五千多斤，面积比去年扩大了五千五百十六亩，粮油总产量比去年多收了一倍。在公社旁边的草地上，一群牧羊姑娘正欢乐地歌唱：
        在青青的草原上，
        我们是牧羊的能手；
        在金色的田野上，
        我们是种庄稼的好汉；
        柯尔克孜人跨上骏马，
        带着人民公社的幸福飞向远方。
    早就听说柯尔克孜人热情好客。我们来到托云公社最西边的托云大队，刚跳下车，迎面就跑来了两个柯族青年，互相握手、拍肩，就像老友重逢似的。
    这两个青年，一位是分管牧业的大队党支部书记亚生，年纪不过三十，由于童年就给牧主家放羊，在他那黝黑的脸上，已经留下与他年纪极不相称的皱纹。另一位是来牧场度暑假的应届高中毕业生买买提，他才十七岁，再过几天，就要作为柯尔克孜族第一代大学生，跨入新疆大学的校门。
    因为畜群已经转移到秋季牧场，我们只好暂时宿在尚未转移的牛奶厂的帐篷里。这是两座用毛毡围成的圆锥形的蒙古包，设在一条小河边上，在离帐篷不远的地方，便是拥有两百多头奶牛和奶马的露天奶厂。奶厂里，一群身矮毛长、形如雄狮的牦牛，正在相互追逐嬉戏。身着彩色衫裙的柯尔克孜族妇女，挥动着灵巧的双手，挤着宛如喷泉的马奶。厂长苏来曼，走来向我们介绍奶厂的生产情况。他说在这草料丰足的日子里，奶厂一天至少能生产近千斤奶汁，这些奶汁除了供给大队里几个食堂食用外，还可以大批加工成各种奶制品，卖给国家。他把我们带到一个储存乳品的帐篷，拉开门帘，乳香扑鼻，里面摆满了一盆盆的奶油，一箱箱的酸奶疙瘩，篷杆上还挂着许多个满装着马奶的皮囊。
    参观了存库之后，我们来到了帐篷。女主人一步赶前，轻轻掀开门帘，里面横放着一张长形木架，木架上摆着精致的大木箱。木架前面铺着几条花毡，按照柯尔克孜人的习惯，这是招待客人的睡铺。白天，这个睡铺便是待客的坐席。帐篷中央是生火烧饭的地方，挖有一个小坑，上面放着三角锅架。现在，男主人正在这里忙着给我们作最珍贵的食品——熬煮手抓羊肉。
    女主人提来水壶，轻轻地给我们泼上三次洗手水，这是饭前的礼节。接着，奶油、奶茶、奶油煎饼、奶油炸糕和手抓羊肉，一盘又一盘地摆满了一个毡面。支部书记这时也活跃起来，又是敬酒、又是敬肉，并且按照他们的传统礼节，每在敬酒之前，总要对客人说一大段富有诗意的祝语。热情的主人慢慢由说变唱，考姆兹弹开了，歌声响起来了：
        毛主席是太阳，
        他照绿了草原，
        他照亮了山岗；
        马儿在奔腾，
        羊儿在欢唱，
        太阳照在我们心上；
        我们人旺牲畜也旺。
    夜幕徐徐下沉，畜群已经归圈，广阔无边的草原上，簇簇篝火开始出现，人们围着火堆在谈天说笑。三三两两的猎人，骑马背枪，来回在畜群四周巡视。秋天的牧场，水草丰茂，是一年中放牧的大好季节，可是，也是野狼常常出来为害畜群的时候。因此，每个大队都组织有几个好猎手，专门守护畜群。在新疆，许多柯尔克孜人都是打猎的能手，老猎人依明·巴衣沙里就是很不错的一个。解放以来，他打死的其他野兽不算，光恶狼就打死了一百多条。有一次，他上山去查看安放的铁夹，夹着了一条狼，但周围有十四条恶狼看守。这群狼发现了他，便从四面八方凶猛地扑来。他沉着地和狼群搏斗，击退了狼群的反扑，还打死了一条大狼。
    夜色深沉，忽闪忽闪的篝火，给人们带来了睡意，谈笑声停止了，大家进入了甜蜜的睡乡。只有三三两两的猎人，还在漆黑的深夜里，警惕地守护着畜群。（附图片）
