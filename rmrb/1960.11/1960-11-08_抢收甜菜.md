    Rushing to Harvest Sugar Beets
    This year, the sugar beets planted in Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia are mostly growing well. As of now, Jilin's sugar beets have been basically harvested, and over 100 million jin of sugar beets have been transported to sugar factories.
      Large quantities of sugar beets from Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia are being sold to the state.
    Before the harvest, all localities made full preparations, properly arranged labor, animal power, and tools, and deployed the rush harvesting and transportation of sugar beets. In the harvest, the communes in various localities strived for rapid progress and good quality, and carried out a second harvest in the harvested sugar beet fields, striving to harvest cleanly and pick thoroughly, leaving no leaves behind.

    抢收甜菜
    今年，吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古种植的甜菜大部分生长良好。截至目前，吉林的甜菜已基本收完，运进糖厂的甜菜已达一亿多斤。
      黑龙江、内蒙古的大批甜菜正向国家交售。
    在收获前，各地都作了充分准备，妥善地安排了劳力、畜力和工具，布置了甜菜的抢收和运送工作。各地公社在收获中，力求进度快、质量好，并在收过的甜菜地进行了复收，争取收净拣净，棵叶不丢。
