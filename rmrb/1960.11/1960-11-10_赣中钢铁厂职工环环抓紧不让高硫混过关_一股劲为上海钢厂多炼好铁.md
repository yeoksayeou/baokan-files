The workers of the Ganzhong Iron and Steel Plant in Jiangxi Province, under the ideological guidance of wholeheartedly supporting key steel plants, are of one mind and with one burst of energy, tightly controlling desulfurization at every link to improve the quality of pig iron. They have already used raw materials and fuels with high ash content and many impurities to produce a large batch of high-quality pig iron to support Shanghai's steel plants. In the first ten months of this year, the sulfur content of pig iron in the entire plant has been controlled at around 0.1% every month, and the qualification rate has remained as high as over 90%. The quality of pig iron ranks among the best in the province.

At the end of last year, due to the high ash content and many impurities in coke and ore, the sulfur content of the plant's pig iron once exceeded 0.2%. The plant's Party committee promptly launched an ideological education campaign of "Everyone Desulfurizes, Everyone Guarantees Quality, and Vigorously Supports Key Steel Plants," using specific examples to educate employees about the importance of pig iron quality. Since then, Party organizations at all levels in the plant have continuously educated employees to further establish the "One Chessboard for the Whole Country" ideology of ensuring quality and quantity and supporting key plants. Employees in all types of work and processes can consciously and meticulously grasp desulfurization work. Party organizations at all levels also promptly commend advanced individuals who value quality. For example, after Yan Guisheng, a worker at the No. 3 blast furnace, received education on ensuring the quality of pig iron and supporting key steel plants, he changed his past operating methods, automatically found an iron sieve, and insisted on sifting out powdery ore and impurities before putting it into the furnace. The workshop's Party branch promptly commended his actions, promoting workers in various furnaces to learn from Yan Guisheng, so that the system of feeding fine materials into the furnace can be better adhered to.

After the employees' ideological understanding was enhanced, everyone unremittingly controlled every level in raw material management, reasonable batching, ensuring furnace temperature, and iron testing, and everyone took the initiative to desulfurize. In order to prevent ash and impurities from getting into the trucks, transport workers changed from using shovels to using nail rakes when loading coke, selected good coke and lump coke for loading; and when unloading, they also made sure to tip and place gently to avoid increasing crushed coke and ensure that the materials transported to the blast furnace were all good materials.

In order to improve desulfurization efficiency, the Ganzhong Iron and Steel Plant extensively carried out technical revolution and vigorously promoted advanced experience in desulfurization. Employees of the entire plant have proposed and created nearly a hundred new technologies, new tools, and new processes related to desulfurization. After multiple rounds of sorting and improvement, more than ten major innovation projects have been incorporated into the desulfurization "one-stop" process regulations. From the crushing, screening, washing, batching, and smelting of raw materials and fuels to the tapping of iron, there have been innovations at every link, and the efficiency of desulfurization has been significantly improved. Hu Xiangfa, a reform pacesetter who attended the National Congress of Heroes from this plant, installed a grading vibrating screen at the exit of the ore crusher, so that the crushed ore is automatically divided into three different grades, and waste rock and impurities are automatically separated from the ore, which ensures that the ore is graded into the furnace and also ensures that the blast furnace eats fine materials.

All employees in the plant work closely together in production and actively cooperate with upstream and downstream processes to improve desulfurization efficiency. For example, after Yu Kaichang, a hot blast stove worker, goes to work, in addition to checking the combustion of the hot blast stove, he also goes to the front and back of the blast furnace to look at the molten iron and slag. If he finds that the wind temperature in the blast furnace cannot meet the desulfurization requirements, he promptly adjusts the combustion temperature and diligently cleans the ash to ensure normal wind temperature.

    赣中钢铁厂职工环环抓紧不让高硫混过关
    一股劲为上海钢厂多炼好铁
    本报南昌9日电　江西省赣中钢铁厂职工在全力支援重点钢厂的思想指导下，大家一条心，一股劲，环环抓紧脱硫，提高生铁质量。他们已经用灰分高、杂质多的原料燃料，炼出大批优质生铁支援上海各钢厂。今年头十个月，全厂生铁含硫量月月控制在0.1％左右，合格率一直高达90％以上。生铁质量在全省名列前茅。
    去年年底，由于焦炭、矿石灰分高、杂质多，这个厂的生铁含硫量曾经一度超过0.2％。厂党委及时开展了一次“人人脱硫，个个保质，大力支援重点钢厂”的思想教育，用具体事例教育职工重视生铁质量。此后，这个厂的各级党组织又经常不断地教育职工进一步树立保质保量、支援重点的“全国一盘棋”的思想。全厂各个工种、工序的职工都能自觉地、一丝不苟地抓紧脱硫工作。各级党组织还及时表扬重视质量的先进人物。例如，三号高炉炉后工晏桂生受到保证生铁质量、支援重点钢厂的教育以后，改变了过去的操作方法，自动找来铁筛，坚持把粉矿、杂质筛净后再行入炉。车间党总支及时表扬了他的行动，推动各炉工人向晏桂生学习，使精料入炉制度能更好地坚持。
    职工思想认识提高以后，大家在原料管理、合理配料、保证炉温、出铁化验等各个环节，都坚持不懈地层层把关，人人动手脱硫。运输工人为了不让灰分、杂质上车，装焦炭时，改用钉齿耙而不用铲，选出好焦、块焦装车；在卸车时又做到轻倒轻放，以免增加碎焦，保证运到高炉旁的都是好料。
    赣中钢铁厂为了提高脱硫效率，广泛地开展技术革命，大力推广脱硫的先进经验。全厂职工曾提出和创造了近百项有关脱硫的新技术、新工具和新工艺，经过多次整理提高，已有十余项重大的革新项目纳入脱硫“一条龙”的工艺规程。从原料燃料的破碎、筛分、洗选、配料、冶炼一直到出铁，环环都有革新，脱硫效率显著提高。这个厂曾出席全国群英会的革新标兵胡祥发，在矿石破碎机出口地方装了一台分级震动筛，使破碎的矿石自动分成大小不同的三级，使废石和杂质自动和矿石隔离，既保证了矿石分级入炉，又保证了高炉吃精料。
    全厂职工在生产中都紧密协作，主动配合上下工序提高脱硫效率。例如，热风炉工人余开常上班以后，除检查热风炉的燃烧情况以外，还到高炉前后看铁水和铁渣，如发现高炉内风温不能满足去硫要求，便及时调节燃烧温度，并且勤加清灰，以保证风温正常。
