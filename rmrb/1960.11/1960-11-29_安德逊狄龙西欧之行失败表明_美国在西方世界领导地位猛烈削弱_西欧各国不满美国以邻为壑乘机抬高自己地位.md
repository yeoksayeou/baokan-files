Xinhua News Agency, London, November 27th. Correspondent Yan Biao reports: U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Undersecretary of State Dillon yesterday ended their ill-fated trip to Western Europe seeking aid to ease the dollar crisis, and returned home crestfallen.

These two "gloomy Americans" (as the British newspapers called them) held a day of talks with key British officials in London after successive failures in visits to Bonn and Paris. The lesson of being publicly rejected in West Germany made these two U.S. envoys understand that they could not force money out of the British by demanding that Britain bear a greater share of military spending and foreign "aid." They took another approach, asking Britain to help the United States stabilize the gold market and stop the massive outflow of dollars. Britain's idea in this meeting was to block any demands made by the United States and to test the extent of the "estrangement" between Washington and Bonn. The *Daily Express* even suggested that Britain should take the initiative on the major issues now facing NATO, taking advantage of "almost the lowest ebb in post-war U.S.-West German relations this week."

To this end, British newspapers have been constantly criticizing West Germany for being "ungrateful" to Washington these days, and have spoken extensively about the mutual "understanding" between Britain and the United States regarding each other's difficulties. The British side made a "generous" gesture at the meeting, indicating that Britain agreed with the U.S. view that West Germany should pay for the expenses of U.S. troops stationed in West Germany. As for Britain itself? It is said that although it "fully sympathizes" with the plight of the United States, it cannot help. For example, *The Times* wrote in this vein that the Anglo-American talks could be described as "mild" and "poignant." "Poignant" because Bonn, which has so many gold and dollar reserves, directly rejected U.S. demands, and "mild" because the United States "understands" that Britain has already made its "sacrifices" and contributions to the Western cause.

However, all these high-sounding phrases like "mutual understanding" cannot hide the contradictions and suspicions between the two sides. According to the few disclosures from the talks, the two U.S. officials probably asked the British to further lower its bank interest rates to help stop the flow of dollars to Britain. Implementing this measure would break Britain's unstable international balance of payments and expose it to a foreign exchange crisis. On the other hand, Britain expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. attaching "buy American" conditions to foreign "aid." It has been repeatedly reported that Britain fears the United States may take various restrictive measures, such as controlling foreign exchange, raising tariffs, and further reducing dollar spending abroad. No matter which measure is taken, Britain is bound to be one of the first countries to suffer.

Anderson and Dillon's trip to seek dollars (mainly targeting Bonn) was a complete failure. The U.S. balance of international payments is rapidly deteriorating. While they were abroad, the United States' gold reserves faced the dangerous situation of falling below 18 billion U.S. dollars for the first time since 1940. It is this urgent situation that forced the United States to take off its white gloves and once again use blatant coercion and blackmail against its allies.

In order to overcome its difficulties at the expense of others, the United States has made a variety of financial demands. First of all, it demands that its allies bear a greater share of military spending and foreign "aid," which is what it did to West Germany. In terms of foreign "aid," the United States even forced West Germany not to attach conditions of buying West German goods to its "aid," in order to benefit U.S. exports, but the United States attached "buy American" conditions to its own foreign "aid." In terms of trade, the United States wants to make it easier for American goods to enter these Western European countries, but it is itself formulating restrictive measures to restrict Western European goods in the U.S. market. In order to stabilize the gold market, in addition to putting pressure on its partners to lower bank interest rates, the United States is also said to have asked the central banks of these countries not to convert their dollar reserves into gold with the United States. These countries therefore demanded that the United States promise to guarantee their losses to support its promise that the dollar would not be publicly devalued. But the United States is unwilling to make this guarantee; it has no confidence in the future itself.

The decisive factor that doomed the U.S. delegation to failure this time was Bonn's outright "rejection" of U.S. demands, especially the demand that West Germany immediately pay 600 million U.S. dollars as occupation fees for U.S. troops stationed in West Germany. Coupled with the subsequent cold attitude taken by Paris and London, this constituted the complete failure of the Anderson-Dillon trip. The fact that U.S. officials had to go to Western Europe with hats in hand to beg for alms was considered by the newspapers here to be a "ironic contrast" to the Western European politicians who went to Washington to beg for aid in the early post-war years. The Western world was also surprised, and Paris and London were gloating, that the United States, which has always unreservedly supported the revival of West German militarism, was snubbed by Bonn this time. The newspapers here pointed out that this was the first serious conflict between West Germany and its American benefactor since Adenauer came to power twelve years ago. The failure of the U.S. delegation shows that the U.S. leadership in the Western world has been sharply weakened due to the declining U.S. economic position. This also vividly reflects the internal contradictions and life-and-death struggles between imperialist countries. With the further aggravation of the economic crisis, there will be more of this kind of exposure of contradictions and struggles in the future!

    安德逊狄龙西欧之行失败表明
  　美国在西方世界领导地位猛烈削弱
    西欧各国不满美国以邻为壑乘机抬高自己地位
    新华社伦敦27日电　本社记者言彪报道：美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙昨天结束了他们到西欧来觅求援助以缓和美元危机的倒霉的旅行，灰溜溜地离开这里回国。
    这两个“愁眉苦脸的美国人”
  （英国报纸这样称呼他们）在访问波恩、巴黎接连失败后到伦敦同英国主要官员举行了一天的会谈。在西德遭到公开拒绝的教训使这两个美国特使懂得，他们不能期望用要求英国承担更大份额的军费和对外“援助”的办法，来逼出英国人的钱。他们另辟途径，要求英国帮助美国稳定黄金市场和制止美元大量外流。英国在这次会谈中的主意是：挡开美国提出的任何要求，并且摸一摸华盛顿和波恩之间“疏远的程度”。《每日快报》甚至献策说，英国应当利用“本星期的美国—西德战后关系中几乎空前的最低潮”，“在北大西洋公约组织现在面临的重大问题上攫取主动权”。
    为此，英国报纸这几天不断批评西德对华盛顿“忘恩负义”，并大谈英、美对彼此困难的相互“谅解”。英国方面在会谈中作了一个“慷慨的”姿态，表示英国同意美国的西德应该支付美国驻西德军队开支的意见。说到英国自己呢？据说尽管它“完全同情”美国的处境，却是爱莫能助。例如《泰晤士报》就按照这个方针写道，英美会谈可说是“温和的”、“心酸的”。所以“心酸”是因为拥有那么多黄金美元储备的波恩竟直截了当地拒绝美国的要求，所以“温和”是因为美国“谅解”英国已对西方的事业作出了它的“牺牲”和贡献。
    但是，所有这一切所谓“相互谅解”之类的高调掩盖不了双方之间的矛盾和猜疑。根据会谈中很少的透露，这两个美国大员大概已经要求英国人进一步降低它的银行利率来帮助制止美元流往英国。如果实行这一措施，是会打破英国不稳定的国际支付平衡，并使它遭到外汇危机的。另一方面，英国表示了不满美国对外“援助”附加“买美国货”的条件。一再有消息说，英国害怕美国可能采取各种限制性措施，如管制外汇，提高关税，和进一步削减在国外的美元支出。不论那一种措施，英国少不了是首先遭殃的国家之一。
    安德逊和狄龙寻求美元之行（主要以波恩为对象）彻底失败了。美国国际收支状况正在迅速恶化。正当他们在国外的时候，美国的黄金储备出现了自从1940年以来第一次跌到一百八十亿美元之下的危险局面。迫使美国决定脱下它的白手套，对它的盟国再一次使用公然的胁迫和敲诈手段的，正是这种燃眉之急。
    为了牺牲别人使自己度过困难，美国在金融方面的要求是多种多样的。首先，它要求它的盟国承担更大份额的军费和对外“援助”，对西德就是这样做的。在对外“援助”方面，美国甚至逼迫西德不让它的“援助”附加购买西德货的条件，以利于美国出口，但是美国在自己的对外“援助”中却附加“买美国货”的条件。在贸易方面，美国想使美国货更自由地进入这些西欧国家，但是自己却正在制订限制性措施，对西欧在美国市场上的货物加以限制。为了稳定黄金市场，美国除了施加压力要求它的小伙伴降低银行利率外，据说还要求这些国家的中央银行不要把它们的美元储备向美国兑换黄金。这些国家因此要求美国答应担保它们的损失，来支持它的关于美元将不会公开贬值的诺言。但是美国却不愿作出这种保证，它自己对将来也没有信心。
    使美国代表团这一次注定失败的决定性因素，是波恩干脆“拒绝”美国的要求，特别是西德应当立即支付六亿美元作为美国驻西德军队的占领费用的要求。加上巴黎和伦敦随后采取的冷淡态度，这就构成了安德逊狄龙之行的彻底失败。美国大员不得不伸着帽子到西欧化缘这一事实，被这里的报纸认为是战后头几年中西欧政治家朝拜华盛顿乞求援助的一个“讽刺的对照”。美国一向无保留地支持西德军国主义的复活而波恩这次竟给美国碰了一鼻子灰，也使得西方世界感到惊讶，并且引起巴黎和伦敦的幸灾乐祸。这里的报纸指出，这是阿登纳自从十二年前上台以来西德同它的美国恩人第一次严重冲突。美国代表团的失败表明，由于美国经济地位日益下降美国在西方世界中领导地位猛烈削弱了。这也生动地反映了帝国主义国家之间的内部矛盾和你死我活的斗争。随着经济危机的进一步加剧，这种矛盾和斗争的大暴露今后还有着呢！
