Canteens Vigorously Engage in Production: Achieving Self-Sufficiency in Oil, Salt, Firewood, and Vegetables
Hunan's Vast Rural Communes Establish Small Family Holdings, Improving Livelihoods and Boosting Production
Jiangkou Commune Focuses on Running Canteens Well to Arrange for Winter Life for Commune Members

Changsha, November 13th (This newspaper's dispatch) – Rural People's Communes in Hunan Province have conscientiously established and appropriately developed small family holding production for their canteens, further improving the operation of the canteens, improving the lives of commune members, thereby greatly enhancing the production enthusiasm of commune members, and powerfully promoting the development of production.

Due to the development of small family holding production, more than 380,000 rural public canteens in the province have planted more than 6.03 million mu of autumn vegetables, an average of nearly two fen of vegetables per person. More than 92% of the canteens in the province have raised pigs, with a total of 2.81 million pigs in stock; most canteens have also raised poultry and fish. Furthermore, 75.2% of the canteens in the province have achieved self-sufficiency in oil, salt, firewood, vegetables, cooking utensil replacements, and management expenses.

Since the beginning of spring this year, many red banner canteens with good living conditions and high production enthusiasm have emerged in various parts of Hunan. The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party systematically summarized the experience of running canteens well and found that appropriately developing the small family holdings of canteens, without hindering large collective production, is an important link in improving livelihoods, developing production, and consolidating the agricultural front line. Therefore, the Provincial Committee required rural public canteens in various regions to quickly establish family holding production.

In establishing small family holdings, all localities have, in accordance with regulations, delimited the scope of operation in light of local conditions and correctly handled income distribution. The small family holdings of the canteens mainly manage vegetable gardens and fodder land, raising pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, and rabbits. Where conditions permit, fish ponds are also designated for fish farming. The income of the canteens is mainly used to cover oil and salt expenses. This has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members to actively establish small family holdings for canteens and run the canteens well.

While establishing small family holdings for canteens, all localities have also established and improved democratic management systems, regularly inspect and discuss the work of the canteens, and mobilize commune members to jointly manage the canteens.

Because living conditions have been improved, the production enthusiasm of commune members has been greatly stimulated. At present, a high tide of autumn harvest and winter planting has been launched throughout the province.

Hefei, November 13th (This newspaper's dispatch) – The leaders of Jiangkou Commune in Yingshang County, Anhui Province, are very concerned about the lives of commune members. Before the severe winter arrives, they seize the opportunity to actively prepare for the winter in an all-round way for the commune members, focusing on collecting as much as possible.

In the comprehensive preparation for winter, Jiangkou Commune first grasped the central link of "collecting." Whether it is grain, vegetables, feed, firewood, domestic or wild produce, all should be collected before rain and snow. While focusing on the autumn harvest and winter planting, each production team organized 6,000 auxiliary laborers to carry out "small autumn harvest" and re-collection movements. In addition to collecting a large amount of grain, they also collected more than 600,000 jin of feed, more than 600,000 jin of dried vegetables, and 2 million jin of firewood.

Secondly, focusing on running the canteens well, make comprehensive arrangements for the winter life of commune members. While arranging for the purchase of grain, each production team also retained sufficient rations according to standards. In addition to each household planting vegetables, the entire commune also collectively planted many autumn vegetables in units of canteens, and the planting of winter vegetables is also being carried out intensively. The entire commune has already dried and stored more than 1.4 million jin of dried vegetables. Most of the firewood needed by the entire commune this winter has already been prepared. Nearly 4,000 rooms in the entire commune that need to be repaired have been repaired.

Because this commune made preparations for the winter early, the commune members focused on production, the progress of the autumn harvest and winter planting was fast, the quality was good, and the grain purchase tasks were completed quickly, making it an advanced commune in the county.

    食堂大搞生产  油盐柴菜自给
    湖南广大农村食堂建立小家底，改善了生活，促进了生产
    江口公社以办好食堂为中心安排社员冬季生活
    本报长沙13日电　湖南省农村人民公社认真建立和适当发展了食堂的小家底生产，进一步办好了食堂，改善了社员生活，从而大大提高了社员的生产积极性，有力地推动了生产的发展。
    由于小家底生产的发展，全省三十八万多个农村公共食堂，已种秋菜六百零三万多亩，平均每人种菜近二分。全省有92％以上的食堂都养了猪，存栏猪达二百八十一万头；大部分食堂都喂了家禽，养了鱼。全省还有75.2％的食堂作到了油、盐、柴、蔬菜、炊具添置和管理费用等自给。
    今年入春以来，湖南各地就出现了许多生活搞得好、生产劲头高的红旗食堂。中共湖南省委系统地总结了办好食堂的经验，找到了在不妨碍大集体生产的原则下，适当发展食堂的小家底，是搞好生活，发展生产，巩固农业第一线的一个重要环节。因此，省委要求各地农村公共食堂迅速建立家底生产。
    在建立小家底中，各地都根据规定，因地制宜地划分了经营范围，并正确处理收入分配。食堂小家底主要经营菜地和饲料地，喂猪、养鸡、鸭、鹅、兔，有条件的地方，还固定了鱼塘养鱼。食堂收入主要用于开支油盐费用。这样大大鼓舞了广大社员积极建立食堂小家底、办好食堂的积极性。
    各地在建立食堂小家底中，同时建立和健全了民主管理制度，定期检查讨论食堂工作，发动社员共同管理食堂。
    由于生活搞得好，大大激发了社员的生产积极性。目前全省已经掀起了秋收冬播高潮。
    本报合肥13日电　安徽省颍上县江口公社领导上非常关心社员生活，在严冬到来之前，就抓紧时机，以尽量多收为中心，积极为社员全面做好过冬准备。
    江口公社在全面准备过冬当中，首先抓住了“收”这个中心环节。不论粮食、蔬菜、饲料、烧柴，家生的、野生的，都尽量在雨雪来临之前，全部收回。各生产队在把主力用于秋收秋种的同时，组织了六千个辅助劳动力，开展了“小秋收”和复收运动，除收回大量粮食外，还收回饲料六十多万斤，干菜六十多万斤，柴草二百万斤。
    其次，以办好食堂为中心，全面安排社员过冬生活。各生产队在安排征购粮的同时，口粮也按标准留足。全社除了户户种菜以外，还以食堂为单位集体种植了很多秋菜，冬菜的种植也在突击进行，全公社已晒储干菜一百四十多万斤。今冬全社需要的烧柴，大部分已经准备好了。全社需要整修的房屋，已修好近四千间。
    由于这个公社及早进行了过冬准备，社员一心搞生产，秋收秋种的进度快，质量好，粮食征购任务也完成得很快，成了全县的先进公社。
