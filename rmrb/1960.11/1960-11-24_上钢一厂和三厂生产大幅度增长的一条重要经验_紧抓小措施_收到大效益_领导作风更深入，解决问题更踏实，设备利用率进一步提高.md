Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd - An important experience from Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 and Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 for substantial production growth is to focus on small measures and solve small problems in production while also grasping key, plant-wide issues and significant initiatives.

Steelmaking production has strong continuity. Each link is tightly connected. If one link is broken, even if a screw is loose or a switch fails, the entire production may suffer losses. For example, the converter rocking switch, for each heat of steel, needs to be moved back and forth nearly two hundred times in just over twenty minutes. Any small part failure in the switch will affect the entire furnace. Therefore, since the launch of the production increase and conservation campaign in August, these two steel plants have attached great importance to regularly taking small measures and solving frequently occurring small problems, thereby ensuring that the equipment operates more normally and further improving equipment utilization. After Steel Plant No. 3's First Converter Workshop used a large blower in October, the blowing time for each heat of steel was shortened, but the splashing of molten iron was more severe during blowing. The bricklayers and furnace front workers repeatedly discussed, simply changing the large tuyere of the converter to a small tuyere and slightly improving the furnace hearth, which shortened the blowing time for each heat by four minutes. The consumption of pig iron per ton of steel was also reduced to below 1,224 kilograms. Small measures yielded great benefits. Employees of Steel Plant No. 1's Second Converter Workshop especially strengthened the inspection and maintenance of small parts inside the rocking switch. Therefore, the rocking switch has never malfunctioned in recent months, keeping the furnace at a high operating rate.

Minor fixes and repairs promptly solve small problems closely related to workers' operations, and are well-received by the workers. In September, the cupola in the First Converter Workshop of Steel Plant No. 1 often experienced material shortage because the coke transportation from the stockyard couldn't keep up. The material transport workers reported that the material hopper of the small flatbed car used to transport coke was too shallow. Adding two baskets on top could only load over 200 kilograms per car, and lifting the baskets up and down was both time-consuming and inconvenient. Everyone was very anxious. The workshop leaders attached great importance to this opinion and immediately mobilized the repair workers and the material transport workers to work together, using some scrap iron plates to raise the material hopper of all flatbed cars by five or six inches. Each car could load about 300 kilograms of coke, without having to add baskets anymore, saving the workers a lot of effort. Once the problem was solved, the material transport workers were very happy and even more motivated. They guaranteed to the furnace front: deliver as much material as needed. Since then, the material shortage of the cupola has been basically eliminated.

Seriously grasping small measures and solving small problems is the result of leaders further improving their work style. The cadres of the Second Converter Workshop of Steel Plant No. 3 were first inspired by the No. 1 cupola. When the No. 1 furnace started the experimental furnace, there was no large blower and no new hot blast stove. At that time, some cadres believed that output could only increase with a large blower and a hot blast stove. However, under the leadership of the Party, the workers did it themselves, removing unnecessary air ducts and valves, and blocking and repairing the air leaks in the air ducts, which fully utilized the original equipment. The No. 1 furnace became a model furnace in the city. Since then, the workshop cadres' views on the many small problems and measures proposed by the masses have changed. Their work style is more in-depth, problem solving more pragmatic, and meticulous. The output of the cupola in this workshop increased, and the molten iron increased, but the converter blowing often couldn't keep up. What was the reason? The workshop leaders went deep into the furnace front and worked with the workers to carefully find the reasons. It turned out that the lime supply couldn't meet the needs of the converter. Tracing further, it turned out that lime, lime baskets, and labor were all available, but the baskets had no ropes, which made them inconvenient to use and inefficient. Therefore, molten iron was waiting for the converter, the converter was waiting for lime, and the lime was waiting for the basket, and the problem was finally focused on a rope. Once the small problem of the rope was solved, the contradiction that the converter blowing couldn't keep up was also quickly resolved. After the other workshops of the two plants promoted the experience of the Second Converter Workshop in grasping small measures, the relationship between cadres and the masses became closer. Now, many workers often talk to leaders about their specific small problems in production, talk about the situation, and talk about their experiences. In this way, leaders' understanding and command of production is also more comprehensive, accurate, flexible, and proactive.

In the process of solving small problems, the leaders at all levels of the two factories have always adhered to the practice of mobilizing the masses to solve the problems raised by the masses. Many small problems are solved quickly, with great results and little cost. Since November, the workers in the Second Converter Workshop of Steel Plant No. 3 have raised more than 120 comments on equipment repair, parts replacement, and other issues at the after-shift discussion meeting. The workshop leaders carefully summarized and sorted them out one by one. Those that should be solved by the workshop were immediately assigned to specific personnel, and the time and project were contracted to be solved. Those that the masses can solve themselves are handed over to the workers' after-shift discussion meetings and experience exchange meetings to find solutions. For example, some time ago, the iron outlet of the cupola in the workshop could not be blocked, and molten iron often overflowed from the steel ladle. However, the workers of the No. 2 furnace were successful every time, and the iron eye was blocked very well. The workshop leadership immediately helped the No. 2 furnace summarize the experience of blocking the iron eye. The workers of the No. 2 furnace said that their main trick was to make the mud plug for the iron eye well. If it's dry, sprinkle some water on it; if it's wet, bake it dry. After this simple and effective method was promoted, the effect was immediately visible. (Attached picture)

The dock stevedores and technicians at the Jiangbian Wharf of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 added only an automatic "lotus grab bucket" for loading and unloading coal to the crane, which reduced the time for coal to be unloaded from the barge to the truck from the past twelve minutes to two minutes, saving eight laborers and powerfully guaranteeing the needs of the gas furnace in the steelmaking workshop.

    上钢一厂和三厂生产大幅度增长的一条重要经验
    紧抓小措施　收到大效益
    领导作风更深入，解决问题更踏实，设备利用率进一步提高
    新华社上海23日电　在狠抓全厂性关键问题和重大措施的同时，要切实抓小措施，解决生产中的小问题。这是上海第一钢铁厂和上海第三钢铁厂生产大幅度增长的一条重要经验。
    炼钢生产连续性很强，每个环节扣得很紧，一环脱节，甚至一颗螺丝松动、一个开关失灵，就可能使整个生产遭受损失。例如，转炉摇炉开关，每炼一炉钢，在短短的二十多分钟内，要往返扳动近二百次，开关内每个小零件发生故障，都对整个炉子发生影响。因此，从8月份开展增产节约运动以来，这两个钢厂非常重视经常采取小措施，解决经常出现的小问题，从而保证设备更加正常地运转，进一步提高了设备利用率。上钢三厂第一转炉车间10月份使用大风机以后，每炉钢的吹炼时间缩短了，但是在吹炼时铁水喷溅得较厉害。砌炉工人和炉前工人反复商量，只是把转炉的大风眼改砌成小风眼，并把炉膛稍加改进，每炉的吹炼时间就缩短了四分钟，每吨钢的生铁消耗也降低到一千二百二十四公斤以下，小措施取得了很大的效益。上钢一厂第二转炉车间职工特别加强了对摇炉开关内小零件的检查和维护，因此几个月来摇炉开关从未发生故障，使炉子保持了很高的作业率。
    修修补补的小措施，及时解决了同工人操作密切有关的小问题，深受工人欢迎。9月份，上钢一厂第一转炉车间的化铁炉，由于料场焦炭运输跟不上，常常发生脱料现象。运料工人反映，原来是运焦炭的小平车料斗太浅，上面加两只箩筐，一车也只能装二百多公斤，而且箩筐抬上抬下，时间既长操作也不方便，大家很焦急。车间领导干部很重视这个意见，马上发动检修工人，和运料工人一起动手，用一些废铁板把所有平车的料斗都加高了五、六寸，每一车装焦炭三百公斤左右，不用再加箩筐了，工人省不少力气。问题一解决，运料工人很高兴，干劲更足，他们向炉前保证：要多少料就运多少料。从此基本消灭了化铁炉脱料现象。
    认真抓小措施、解决小问题，这是领导干部进一步改进作风的结果。上钢三厂第二转炉车间的干部首先从一号化铁炉上得到启发。一号炉开始搞试验炉时，炉子上没有大风机，没有新的热风炉，当时有的干部认为有了大风机、热风炉产量才能上去。但是工人在党的领导下，自己动手，把不必要的风管、阀门拆去，把风管漏风的地方堵塞补好，就充分发挥了原有设备的作用，一号炉成了全市标兵炉。从此以后，车间干部对群众提出来的许多小问题、小措施，看法改变了，他们作风更深入，解决问题更踏实，一丝不苟。这个车间化铁炉产量提高，铁水多了，转炉吹炼却常常跟不上。什么原因呢？车间领导干部深入炉前，和工人一道仔仔细细找原因。原来是石灰供应不上转炉的需要。再追下去，原来石灰、装石灰的箩筐、劳力都有，就是箩筐上没有绳子，使用不便，效率低，因而铁水等转炉，转炉等石灰，石灰等箩筐，而问题最后集中到一根绳子上。绳子这个小问题一解决，转炉吹炼跟不上的矛盾也随着很快地解决。两个厂的其他车间推广第二转炉车间抓小措施的经验以后，干部和群众的关系也更加密切。现在，许多工人都经常找领导干部谈他们生产中的具体小问题，谈情况，谈经验。这样，领导掌握和指挥生产也更全面、更准确、更灵活、更主动。
    在解决小问题的过程中，两个厂的各级领导干部始终坚持群众提出问题发动群众解决的做法。许多小问题解决得快，收效大，花钱少。11月份以来，上钢三厂第二转炉车间工人在班后议论会上，共提出了设备修理、零件调换等一百二十多条意见。车间领导干部都逐条认真地加以归纳整理。该由车间解决的，立即指定专人，定时，定项目包下来解决。群众自己可以解决的，交给工人班后议论会、经验交流会想办法解决。如前些时候，车间里化铁炉出铁口堵不住，常常发生铁水满钢水包现象。而二号炉工人却百发百中，堵铁眼很出色。车间领导方面立即帮助二号炉总结堵铁眼的经验。二号炉工人说，他们的主要窍门就是塞铁眼的坭塞头做得好，干了就洒点水，湿了就烘烘干。这个简单而确实有效的办法推广后，效果立竿见影。（附图片）
    上钢三厂江边码头装卸工人和技术人员一起，仅仅在起重吊车上增添了一只自动装卸煤炭用的“荷花抓斗”，就使煤炭从驳船上岸装车的时间由过去十二分钟缩短到二分钟，节约了八个劳动力，有力地保证了炼钢车间煤气炉的需要。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　	新华社记者　夏道陵摄
