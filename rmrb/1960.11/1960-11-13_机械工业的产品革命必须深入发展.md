An important part of the continued deepening of the technological revolution in the machinery industry (including the electrical machinery industry) is to reform old products, develop new products, and continuously expand varieties, so as to further greatly improve the quality and technical level of China's machinery industry.

Since the beginning of this year, many electromechanical enterprises, in the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, have adopted the "three-way combination" method of designers, manufacturers, and users to make more systematic and comprehensive reforms to products that are being produced or designed. As far as some products are concerned, the reform is no longer just individual parts, but the entire structure; as far as some enterprises or industries are concerned, the reform is no longer just individual products, but a series of products. After the reform of many products, the structure is more reasonable, the efficiency is higher, the performance is better, the materials are more saved, the working hours are less, the manufacturing is easier, the cost is lower, and the start-up is simpler and more labor-saving, so that one machine can be used as several machines, one material can be used as several materials, and one person can be used as several people. Some products, after being reformed, not only transformed themselves, but also caused changes in the production methods and production processes of the user departments, which vigorously promoted the development of the technical revolution.

Now, the task before the electromechanical industry workers is to continue to move forward along the road of the "three-way combination," further develop the variety of China's electromechanical products, and further improve product quality. Expanding varieties and improving quality are important tasks on China's industrial front today. To measure whether a country's industrial level is high or low, we must not only look at the quantity of its main products, but also at the variety and quality of its products; we must not only look at how much it can produce, but also at what it can produce. Only when the quantity is large, the variety is large, and the quality is high, can it be considered a high industrial level. Therefore, we must attach great importance to the issue of expanding varieties and improving quality. For those products that have been proven to improve efficiency, save materials, and save man-hours after reform, and are also currently needed, it is necessary to quickly organize forces to conduct technical appraisal, eliminate technical shortcomings, and rapidly improve the technical level of designers, manufacturers, and users to adapt to the requirements of reformed products, thoroughly pass the technical test, and do a good job in preparing raw materials and tools, so as to quickly put them into formal production and let their superiority play out in socialist construction as soon as possible. For products that have not yet been successfully tested, but are produced in relatively large quantities and consume relatively large amounts of materials and labor, especially electromechanical products needed for agricultural production and steel, iron, coal, mining, and transportation, it is even more necessary to concentrate efforts to first conduct reform experiments and design. Grain and steel are the focus of national economic work. All departments should serve the focus and revolve around the focus. The electromechanical industry should first serve the focus and maximize the needs of the focus. By grasping the important link of product revolution, the machinery industry can combine the technical innovation and technical revolution movement with the production increase and economy movement centered on grain and steel, combine the production increase and economy movement of its own enterprise with supporting agriculture and key enterprises such as steel, and combine the technical development of the electromechanical industry with promoting the continuous leap forward of the entire national economy. After some product equipment has been reformed and production efficiency has been improved, the product equipment in the processes before, after, left, and right that are closely related to it will inevitably experience a temporary mismatch. Therefore, it is necessary to reform the product equipment before, after, left, and right accordingly in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Product revolution includes two contents: reforming old products and creating new products. The creation of new products mainly involves creating advanced, large-scale, precision, and cutting-edge products, mastering the science and technology that we have not yet mastered, producing new products that we have not yet been able to produce, and equipping various departments of the national economy with the latest scientific and technological achievements. In order to build our great motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, we should not only produce all kinds of electromechanical products according to the needs of production development in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that we can produce any variety and specification needed; but also master the technology needed to manufacture "high, large, precise, and advanced" products. Reforming old products involves not only reforming general products, but also appropriately reforming some new products that have already been formally produced. The purpose of the reform is to strive to make the heavy lighter, the large smaller, the complex simpler, and the expensive cheaper in order to save raw materials, save manufacturing time, and save labor, while also making it easier to operate, while improving product performance or maintaining the original performance. Walking on two legs, "high, large, precise, and advanced" and "light, small, simple, and inexpensive," is the correct policy for the revolution of electromechanical products. Neglecting either leg is wrong. Mastering "high, large, precise, and advanced" technology is climbing the peak of technology, and of course, it is necessary to study diligently with great effort in a down-to-earth manner. "Light, small, simple, and inexpensive" also marks the development of technical level from a low-level stage to a high-level stage. It is also impossible without a hard work of study.

The purpose of the product revolution is to equip our agriculture, industry, and transportation with advanced technology and improve the labor efficiency of various departments of the national economy. Therefore, when the product reform work has reached a certain stage, it must be finalized and the newly designed products manufactured as soon as possible and used in production. It is wrong to only reform without finalizing and manufacturing. It is also wrong to only finalize without reforming. The possibility of technological progress is limitless. Product finalization is only the end of a stage of the product revolution, not the end of progress from then on. Reform, finalize, reform again, finalize again, with each time being more progressive than the previous time. This is the law of technological development. We cherish every achievement of the product revolution and every development of technology, but we must never be complacent. Even for very advanced products, we must have a spirit of striving for perfection, constantly listen to the opinions of users, and actively design better mechanical products for various departments of the national economy based on new scientific and technological achievements and new production practices.

### 机械工业的产品革命必须深入发展

    机械工业的产品革命必须深入发展
    机械工业（包括电机工业）继续深入技术革命的一个重要环节，是改革旧产品，发展新产品，不断扩大品种，以便把我国的机械工业的质量和技术水平再大大提高一步。
    今年以来，许多机电企业在技术革新、技术革命运动中，采用设计者、制造者和使用者“三结合”的方法，对正在生产的或者正在设计的产品，作了比较系统、比较全面的改革。就某些产品来讲，经过改革的已经不只是个别的零件，而是整个结构；就某些企业或者行业来讲，改革的已经不只是个别的产品，而是一系列的产品。许多产品经过了改革，结构更加合理，效率更高，性能更好，材料更省，工时更少，制造更容易，成本更低廉，开动起来更简便更省劳动力，使一台机器可以顶几台用，一份材料可以顶几份用，一个人可以顶几个人用。有些产品经过了改革，不但自己脱了胎，换了骨，而且引起了使用部门的生产方法、生产过程的变革，有力地推动了技术革命的发展。
    现在，摆在机电工业职工面前的任务，就是循着“三结合”的这条道路继续前进，进一步发展我国机电产品品种，进一步提高产品质量。扩大品种和提高质量，是当前我国工业战线上的一个重要任务。衡量一个国家的工业水平是高是低，不只要看它的主要产品数量，还要看它的产品品种和产品质量；不只要看它能生产多少东西，还要看它能生产哪些东西。数量多，品种多，质量高，才算工业水平高，因此，我们必须十分重视扩大品种和提高质量的问题。对于那些经过改革证明确实能够提高效率，节约材料、节约工时，而且又是目前需要的产品，要赶快组织力量进行技术鉴定，消除技术上的缺点，迅速提高设计者、制造者和使用者的技术水平，使之与改革产品的要求相适应，彻底过好技术关，并且做好原材料和工具等项准备工作，以便迅速地投入正式生产，让它们的优越性尽早地在社会主义建设中发挥出来。对于还没有试验成功，生产的数量又比较大、占用材料和劳动力又比较多的产品，特别是农业生产和钢、铁、煤、矿、运所需要的机电产品，更要集中力量，首先进行改革试验和设计。粮食、钢铁是国民经济工作的重点。一切部门都应当为重点服务，围绕着重点转。机电工业更应首先为重点服务，最大限度地满足重点的需要。机械工业抓住了产品革命这个重要环节，便可以把技术革新、技术革命运动和以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动结合起来，把自己企业的增产节约运动和支援农业和钢铁等重点企业结合起来，把机电工业的技术发展和推进整个国民经济持续跃进结合起来。有些产品设备经过了改革，提高了生产效率以后，跟它有密切联系的前后左右工序的产品设备，必然会出现暂时不相适应的情况，因此又必须有计划有步骤地对前后左右的产品设备进行相应的改革。
    产品革命包括改革旧产品和创制新产品两个内容。创制新产品，主要是创造高级的、大型的、精密的、尖端的产品，掌握我们至今还没有掌握的科学技术，生产我们至今还不能生产的新产品，用最新的科学技术成就来装备国民经济各个部门。为了把我们伟大的祖国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，我们不但应该根据生产发展的需要，有计划、有步骤地生产各样各种的机电产品，做到需要什么样的品种规格，就能生产什么样的品种规格；而且必须掌握制造“高、大、精、尖”产品所需要的技术。改革旧产品，改革的不只是一般的产品，而且对于已经正式生产的一些新产品也要进行适当的改革。改革的目的，是为了在提高产品效能，或者在保持原有效能的条件下，力求把重的变轻，大的变小，复杂的变简单，昂贵的变低廉，以便节约原料材料，节约制造时间，节约劳动力，同时便于操纵。用“高、大、精、尖”和“轻、小、简、廉”两条腿走路，是机电产品革命的正确方针，忽视任何一条腿都是不对的。掌握“高、大、精、尖”技术，是攀登技术高峰，当然要脚踏实地花很大力量去勤苦钻研。“轻、小、简、廉”，也标志着技术水平由低级阶段向高级阶段的发展，不下苦功夫钻研一番，也是不行的。
    产品革命的目的，是为了用先进的技术装备我们的农业、工业和交通运输业，提高国民经济各个部门的劳动效率。因此产品改革工作进行到一定程度的时候，一定要定型，尽快地把新设计的产品制造出来，用到生产上去。只改革，不定型，不制造，是不对的。只定型，不改革，也是不对的。技术进步的可能性是不可限量的，产品的定型，只是产品革命告一段落，而不是从此止步。改革，定型，再改革，再定型，一次比一次进步，这是技术发展的规律。我们十分珍视产品革命的每一个成就，珍视技术的每一个发展，但绝不能自满。即使对很先进的产品，也要有精益求精的精神，经常倾听使用者的意见，主动地根据新的科学技术成就，新的生产实践，为国民经济各部门设计出更好的机械产品来。
