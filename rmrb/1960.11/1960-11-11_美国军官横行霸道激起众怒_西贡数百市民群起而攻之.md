Xinhua News Agency, 10th: According to the Saigon "Vietnam Times", on the evening of October 29th, hundreds of people in Saigon surrounded three American military officers and attempted to beat them up.

The newspaper reported that the incident was triggered by a quarrel between the three American military officers and two "Air Force Lieutenants" of the Ngo Dinh Diem group in a bar. During the argument, one of the American military officers made offensive remarks, insulting the two "Air Force Lieutenants" of the Ngo Dinh Diem army. When one of the "Lieutenants" retorted, an American military officer grabbed him by the neck, attempting to strangle him. At this point, hundreds of people gathered around to protest and attempted to beat the American military officers severely. The Americans took flight and ran behind the bar's door, locking it.

The newspaper reported that at this moment, police officers from the Ngo Dinh Diem group hurriedly arrived at the scene to protect the Americans. The American embassy also dispatched U.S. Marines armed with automatic pistols and two American officials fifteen minutes later to rescue the three American thugs amidst the protests and jeers of hundreds of people.

    美国军官横行霸道激起众怒
    西贡数百市民群起而攻之
    新华社10日讯　据西贡“越南时报”消息：10月29日晚间西贡市数百名群众包围了三个美国军官并且要把他们打一顿。
    报纸报道，这个事件是因这三个美国军官在一酒吧间同两名吴庭艳集团的“空军尉官”发生口角引起的。在口角时，有一个美国军官出口伤人，侮辱了吴庭艳军队的两名“空军尉官”。当其中一名“中尉”回嘴时，一名美国军官掐住他的脖子，想扼死他。这时，成百人围拢过来表示抗议，并要把这些美国军官痛打一顿。这些美国人拔腿飞跑到酒吧间的门后，把门锁上。
    报纸报道说，就在这时，吴庭艳集团的警察急忙赶到现场保护这批美国人，美国大使馆在十五分钟后也派了佩带自动手枪的美国海军陆战队和两名美国官员，在数百人抗议和嘲骂声中来解救这三个美国匪徒。
