    Workers and Peasants Join Hands to Produce Grain and Steel
    Shenyang Machine Tool Switch Factory, Fan Hua
   Red flags flutter and war drums sound, workers and peasants join hands to produce grain and steel. Workers smelt steel in front of the furnace, molten steel like a vast ocean. Steel is made into new farm tools, new farm tools are sent to the countryside. Peasants plant rice and grain in the fields, weeding, fertilizing, and ensuring irrigation. Every piece of farmland is well-managed, ensuring that every grain returns to the granary. Even in disaster years, production is not reduced, workers and peasants join hands to produce grain and steel.
