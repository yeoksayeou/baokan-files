Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th -- According to reports in newspapers here: Following the demonstration and march by more than 7,000 people in My Tho Province at the end of September against the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique, on October 5th, more than 5,000 residents of Chu Duc Province, disregarding the shooting by puppet troops, held a large-scale demonstration in Tri Ton District, strongly opposing the persecution and war expansion policies of the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique.

According to reports, on that morning, more than 5,000 residents from villages near Tri Ton District, led by a monk named A Cha, holding torches, marched mightily towards Tri Ton District to hold a demonstration.

After learning of this news, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique immediately dispatched a regular army battalion, set up machine guns to prevent the people from advancing, but these threats did not deter the people, and they continued to advance towards the city. At this time, the puppet troops actually used machine guns to fire at the unarmed people, resulting in the death of three demonstrators. Even more barbarically, they grabbed a demonstrator, disemboweled him in front of everyone, and paraded the excavated liver on a bayonet.

This inhuman atrocity by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique aroused great anger among the people. The demonstrators, regardless of any threats, continued to charge towards the city to carry out demonstrations. Faced with the fierce struggle of the masses, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem authorities in Tri Ton District were very panicked. All "government" agencies closed their doors one after another, government employees fled in terror, and each barracks was on high alert as if facing a formidable enemy. At the same time, the enemy dispatched armed forces to suppress the demonstrators, arresting more than 300 people, including the monk A Cha.

Despite the enemy's frenzied persecution and suppression, the demonstrators persisted in their struggle for a full four days. Finally, the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique was forced to release the arrested people.

    强烈反对美吴集团的迫害和扩军备战政策
    越南南方朱笃省五千人大示威
    伪军竟用机枪屠杀群众  示威队伍不顾镇压冲向市区
    新华社河内18日电　据这里的报纸报道：继美萩省人民七千多人9月底举行的反对美吴集团的示威游行之后，10月5日，朱笃省五千多名居民不顾伪军的枪杀，在知松县举行了大示威，强烈反对美吴集团的迫害和扩军备战政策。
    据报道，这天早上，知松县附近村庄的居民五千多人，在一名僧侣阿茶的带领下，举着火把，浩浩荡荡地向知松县进发，举行了示威。
    美吴集团知道这一消息后，立即调来一个营的正规军，架起机关枪阻止人民前进，但是这些威胁没有吓退人民，他们继续向市区前进。这时，伪军竟用机关枪向赤手空拳的人民射击，结果打死了三名示威群众，更野蛮的是，他们还抓了一名示威者，在众人面前剖腹，并且把挖出的肝脏用刺刀挑着示众。
    美吴集团这一毫无人性的暴行，激起了人民的极大愤怒，示威者不顾一切威胁，继续冲向市区进行游行示威。在群众激烈斗争的面前，知松县美吴集团当局非常慌张，各“政府”机关纷纷关门，公务人员抱头鼠窜，各兵营如临大敌。与此同时，敌人又派出武装力量对示威群众加以镇压，逮捕了三百多人，其中有阿茶僧侣。
    尽管敌人进行疯狂的迫害和镇压，示威群众仍然坚持斗争了整整四天，最后美吴集团被迫释放了被捕的人。
