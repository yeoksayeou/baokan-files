Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 26th: According to Phnom Penh newspapers, Chen Jin Hong, Director of the Cambodian State Enterprise Bureau, told reporters on the 25th that efforts have been made to increase the output of the Cambodia-China Friendship Textile Factory and the Sihanouk-Zhou Enlai Plywood Factory, so that the products of these two factories can be exported.

He said that the quality of the products of these two factories built with Chinese aid is excellent, better than some imported goods. The proof is that some foreigners want to order these products.

From October 5th to November 10th, the sales department of the State Enterprise Bureau sold three million riels worth of cotton yarn and cloth, and three hundred pieces of plywood.

Chen Jin Hong said that the commissioning of these two factories has produced good results. The market prices of plywood, cotton yarn, and certain types of cloth have been controlled. The black market has disappeared, and cheap goods are available. He said that this has also benefited Cambodian farmers, because the raw materials needed by these two factories, except for gasoline and certain chemicals, are all local agricultural products, such as cotton, rice straw, bamboo, and wood. Previously, rice straw was discarded as waste, but now it is purchased as a raw material for papermaking. In order to meet the needs of the textile factory, the output of cotton has also been greatly increased. All of these help farmers increase their income.

    中国援助修建的两家工厂对柬埔寨经济有良好结果
    新华社金边26日电　据金边报纸报道，柬埔寨国营企业局局长陈金洪25日对报界说，已经作出努力来增加柬中友谊纺织厂和西哈努克—周恩来胶合板工厂的产量，以使这两家工厂的产品能够出口。
    他说，这两家由中国援助修建的工厂的产品的质量是极好的，比某些进口货都好。证据是，有些外国人要想订购这些产品。
    从10月5日到11月10日这一期间，国营企业局的销售部门已经售出了三百万瑞尔的棉纱和布匹以及三百件胶合板。
    陈金洪说，这两家工厂投入生产后已经产生了良好的结果。胶合板、棉纱和某种布匹的市价已经被控制住了。黑市已经消失了，已经有便宜的货品供应。他说，这也使柬埔寨农民得到好处，因为这两家工厂所需要的原料除了汽油和某些化学品外，其余都是当地农产品，如棉花、稻草、竹子和木材。早先稻草是作为废物抛掉的，但是现在把稻草收购起来作为造纸的原料。为了满足纺织厂的需要，也大大增加了棉花的产量。所有这些都有助农民增加收入。
