Silage Sweet Potato Vine Seedlings: Saving Sweet Potato Seeds; Advancing Seedling Cultivation and Planting at the Right Time; Early Tuber Formation and High Yield.

(According to Henan Daily News) In order to save sweet potato seeds and ensure timely planting of sweet potatoes next year, Baliying Commune in Hua County, Henan Province, is vigorously promoting the experience of using silage sweet potato vines to replace fresh sweet potatoes for next-year seedling cultivation.

The method of using silage sweet potato vines to replace fresh sweet potatoes for next-year seedling cultivation was successfully tested last year by Li Hongcai, head of the Baliying Commune Technology Extension Station. The commune is located in a low-lying area, and fresh sweet potato seeds are not easy to preserve, so sweet potatoes have been planted very little over the years. How to solve the problem of sweet potato seedlings and expand the sweet potato planting area has become a major issue of concern to the masses. Based on the principle that corn stalks can be ensiled, Li Hongcai conducted nine kinds of silage sweet potato vine seedling cultivation experiments in the commune's experimental field last year. After detailed observation and recording and final identification, eight kinds failed. Only one kind of sweet potato vine stored in a round cellar had fresh vines and stems, with no change compared to when it was put into the cellar.

The specific method of round cellar storage is: 1. Cellar construction. Choose a high and dry place that is sheltered from the wind and sun and not prone to snow and water accumulation to dig the cellar. The specifications of the cellar are: a depth of six feet, a cylindrical diameter of three and a half feet, and a mouth diameter of two and a half feet. The cellar wall should be smooth, the bottom of the cellar should be flat, and the mouth of the cellar should be one foot above the ground. After the cellar cylinder is dug, dig a storage hole next to the north side of the cellar wall. Leave a bowl-sized air vent at the upper end of the hole and insert a perforated bamboo pole. Install a trapdoor at the upper opening of the bamboo pole to adjust the temperature and humidity inside the cellar. 2. Selection of plants and cutting of vines. The time for cutting the vines should be five to seven days before the Frost's Descent solar term. If it is too early, the vines will be tender and difficult to preserve; if it is too late, they will be damaged by frost. Choose sweet potato vines with thick and strong stems that have not been harmed by diseases or pests, cut the vines into stems one and a half feet long, remove the leaves, and bundle them into small bundles of about fifteen pounds. 3. Timely cellar entry. The time to enter the cellar is two days before the "Frost's Descent." Before entering the cellar, choose dry sandy soil that has not been planted with sweet potatoes for three years, sift it carefully, and spread it in the cellar to a thickness of eight inches to one foot. After the sweet potato vines enter the cellar, place them upright on the dry sandy soil, bury the lower section two to three inches, and separate the bundles with dry sand. 4. Vine cellar management. After the sweet potato vines enter the cellar, check the cellar temperature once every noon, and keep it between 12 and 14 degrees Celsius. Open the opening during the day to allow sunlight to shine in, and cover the opening at night and on windy and rainy days. 5. Seedling cultivation and planting. In early February, when the atmospheric temperature is stable above 8 degrees Celsius, two methods can be adopted for seedling cultivation. One is to cut the sweet potato vines into six-inch lengths and cultivate them on a heated kang to germinate. When the seedlings are eight inches to one foot high, cut the vines and plant them in the field. The second is to cultivate seedlings in a field nursery and cut and plant the vines in stages.

This year, the 35 mu of sweet potatoes planted in this commune using silage sweet potato vine seedlings, according to digging up the plants and weighing them, have averaged about one and a half jin of sweet potatoes per plant, which is a significant increase in yield compared to planting with fresh sweet potato seedlings under the same conditions. The masses have summarized the benefits of silage sweet potato vine seedling cultivation as: saving sweet potato seeds, advancing seedling cultivation and planting, and earlier tuber formation and higher yields.

    滑县八里营公社农业技术推广站站长李洪才
    试验青贮薯秧育苗成功
    青贮薯秧育苗：节省薯种；提早育苗，适时栽种；结薯早，产量高。
    据河南日报消息　河南滑县八里营公社为节约薯种，确保明年甘薯适时栽种，大力推广红薯秧青贮代替鲜薯隔年育苗经验。
    红薯秧青贮代替鲜薯隔年育苗方法，是八里营公社技术推广站站长李洪才去年试验成功的。这个公社地势低洼，鲜薯种不易保存，历年栽种红薯很少。如何解决红薯苗，扩大红薯栽种面积，已成为群众关心的大问题。李洪才根据玉米秆可以青贮的道理，去年在公社试验场搞了九种青贮红薯秧育苗试验。经过详细观察记载和最后鉴定，有八种失败了。仅有一种圆窖贮存的红薯秧，秧茎青鲜，和入窖时对比没有什么变化。
    圆窖贮存的具体作法是：一、窖址建设。选择背风向阳、不易积雪存水的高燥地方挖窖。窖的规格是：深度六尺，圆筒直径三点五尺，口径二点五尺。窖壁光滑，窖底平整、窖口高出地面一尺。窖筒挖成后，靠窖壁北边挖一个贮存洞，洞的上端留一个碗口大小的气眼，用打透的竹竿插进去，竹竿上口安一活门，以便调节窖内的温湿度。二、选棵剪秧。剪秧时间以霜降前五至七天为宜。过早秧嫩不易保存，过晚则受冻害。要选择茎秧粗壮未受过病虫危害的薯秧，剪成长一尺五寸的秧茎，除掉叶子，捆成十五斤左右的小捆。三、适时入窖。入窖时间是在“霜降”前两天。入窖前选择三年未种过红薯的干沙土，经过细筛，在窖内铺八寸至一尺厚。薯秧入窖后，立放在干沙土上，下节埋二至三寸，捆与捆之间用干沙隔离。四、秧窖管理。薯秧入窖后，每天中午检查一次窖温，经常保持摄氏十二至十四度之间，白天开口让阳光照晒，夜晚、风雨天将口盖好。五、育秧栽种。2月初，大气温稳定在摄氏八度以上时，可以采取两种方法育苗。一是将薯秧剪成六寸长育到火炕上发芽，待苗高八寸至一尺高时进行剪秧栽入大田；二是进行田间育苗圃，分期剪秧栽种。
    今年这个公社用青贮薯秧育苗栽种的三十五亩红薯，据挖棵称重，平均每棵已结薯一斤半左右，比鲜薯育苗在同样情况下栽种的产量有显著提高。群众总结红薯秧青贮育苗的好处是：节省薯种，提早育苗栽种，结薯早产量高。
