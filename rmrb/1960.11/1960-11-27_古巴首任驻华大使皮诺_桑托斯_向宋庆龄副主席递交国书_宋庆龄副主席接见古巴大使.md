Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 26th: Oscar Pino Santos, the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Cuba to China, accompanied by First Secretary of the Embassy, Cesecilio Martinez Ortega, presented his credentials to Soong Ching Ling, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, this morning.

Present at the presentation of credentials were: Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China; Ge Buhai, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department; Lin Ping, Deputy Director of the American and Australian Affairs Department; and Liu Shuzhou, Vice Mayor of Shanghai.

Also present was Ambassador Pino Santos' wife.

At the presentation of credentials, Ambassador Pino Santos delivered a eulogy, and Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling delivered a reply.

Ambassador Pino Santos said in his eulogy: Madam Vice Chairman,

It is a great honor for me to present to you the credentials of Dr. Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, President of the Republic of Cuba, certifying my appointment as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Your Excellency.

In accepting this task, I wish to indicate to Your Excellency that I am deeply satisfied to be able to serve as the representative of my government by your side. Your Excellency, this is not only because I have always admired and sympathized with China and its hardworking people, but also because the people of China and Cuba find themselves in a special situation at this historic moment. Your Excellency, your people are fighting correctly and heroically against the forces that in the past exploited your people and kept your country backward. Under the leadership of the government you represent, your people have made great progress on the road to peace, welfare, and culture. These advances, which are admired and recognized throughout the world today, have been achieved by your entire nation through hard work, sweat, and sacrifice.

Naturally, Cuba has also launched a battle. In this battle, the anti-historical forces that prevent Cuba from developing are inevitably doomed to failure. Your Excellency, like the Chinese people, we Cubans have also fought, and are fighting, against the feudal and imperialist reactionaries who obstruct and harm the peoples of all countries. Our country is small, economically underdeveloped, and geographically close to the most aggressive capitalist and imperialist country in history, but our country sees its path clearly and, with the support of the people of all countries, holds high the banner of independence, economic development, political sovereignty, peaceful coexistence, and peaceful exchange. This common effort for a better future—the purest source of friendship and unity among the people of all countries—gives the act of establishing formal diplomatic relations between the government of the Republic of Cuba and the government of the People's Republic of China historical significance. Your Excellency, everyone knows that the fraternal relations between the two peoples have existed for a long time.

In the mid-19th century, hundreds of thousands of Chinese were brought to Cuba and were placed in a state of semi-slavery. Many of them later participated in the wars of independence waged by our people in 1868 and 1895. After the establishment of the Republic, many people stayed or continued to come to our country, building homes that have been integrated with our blood through their diligent and sincere work. Madam Vice Chairman, this means that the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people has existed for more than a century, a true friendship built on the common resistance to exploitation, the patriotic struggle for independence, and daily fraternal coexistence. Now it can be said that this friendship has reached a more complete stage. Your government has extended a hand of support to my government, and my government has gratefully grasped this hand, and hopes that this is just the beginning of frequent exchanges in trade, culture, and friendship. For me personally, of course, it is the greatest pleasure and honor to work to consolidate and develop this beautiful prospect that benefits both sides. Furthermore, in my work, I have the friendly and enthusiastic support of the Cuban people. Less than three months ago, at the Revolutionary National Assembly, based on the document named "Declaration of Havana," the Cuban people decided to sever relations with the puppet regime that usurped your country's representation and to formally establish relations with your country's legitimate, truly people's government. Madam Vice Chairman, I will strive to fulfill such a noble duty and believe that my work will be successful, guaranteed by your trust, your good wishes, and your valuable cooperation.

President of the Republic of Cuba, Dr. Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado, and Prime Minister of our Revolutionary Government, Dr. Fidel Castro, have asked me to convey their concern for the happiness and progress of the People's Republic of China, and to convey their most sincere wishes to Your Excellency and members of your government for the happiness and prosperous development of your great country. I myself would also like to take this opportunity to express such sincere wishes.

Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling replied: Ambassador,

I am very pleased to accept the credentials of Your Excellency's appointment as the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Cuba to the People's Republic of China, and I thank Your Excellency for the friendly congratulations to our people and myself. I would like to take this opportunity, through Your Excellency, to express the sincere respect of the Chinese people and myself to President Dorticós and Prime Minister Fidel Castro. The Chinese people have always followed with great admiration the heroic struggle of the Cuban people against the aggression and intervention of U.S. imperialism and in defense of national independence and state sovereignty. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will do everything possible to support the just struggle of the Cuban people, and believe that the just struggle of the Cuban people will surely achieve a complete victory.

Although China and Cuba are thousands of miles apart, the people of the two countries have long established a deep friendship in the struggle against imperialism. U.S. imperialism has created various obstacles to hinder the normal development of relations between China and Cuba, but the people of China and Cuba, who have won their respective national independence, have finally shattered artificial obstacles and established a new friendly and cooperative relationship. The Chinese people cherish this friendly and cooperative relationship very much and believe that this relationship will be increasingly consolidated and developed. China and Cuba are two peace-loving countries. The friendly cooperation between our two countries is not only conducive to strengthening the friendship between the people of Asia and Latin America, but will also make a significant contribution to maintaining and consolidating world peace.

Ambassador, I warmly welcome Your Excellency to serve as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Cuba to the People's Republic of China. In your work to develop friendly cooperation between China and Cuba, you will receive the full cooperation and support of myself and the government of the People's Republic of China.

I wish your country prosperity and your people prosperity, and I wish President Dorticós and Prime Minister Fidel Castro good health!

    古巴首任驻华大使皮诺·桑托斯
    向宋庆龄副主席递交国书  宋庆龄副主席接见古巴大使
    新华社上海26日电　古巴共和国首任驻华特命全权大使奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯，今天上午偕同大使馆一等秘书塞西尼奥·马丁内斯·奥尔特加，向中华人民共和国宋庆龄副主席递交国书。
    递交国书时在场的有：我国外交部副部长章汉夫、礼宾司副司长葛步海、美澳司副司长林平和上海市副市长刘述周。
    在场的还有皮诺·桑托斯大使夫人。
    递交国书时，皮诺·桑托斯大使致颂词，宋庆龄副主席致答词。
    皮诺·桑托斯大使致颂词说：副主席阁下：
    我极为荣幸地向您呈递古巴共和国总统奥斯瓦耳多·多尔蒂科斯·托拉多博士向阁下证明任命我为特命全权大使的国书。
    在接受这项任务时，我愿向阁下表明，我能在阁下身边作为我国政府的代表，深感满意。阁下，这不仅是因为我一向对于中国和它勤劳的人民敬仰和同情，也还由于中国和古巴人民在这个历史性的时刻处于特殊的环境。阁下，贵国人民正在正确而英勇地向过去使贵国人民遭受剥削和处于落后状态的势力作斗争。在您所代表的政府的领导下，贵国人民在和平、福利与文化的道路上取得了巨大的进步。这些为今天全世界所敬佩和承认的进步是贵国全民族通过努力、流汗和不惜牺牲而取得的。
    自然，古巴也展开了一场战斗。在这场战斗中，阻止古巴发展的反历史的力量不可避免地要失败的。阁下，也像中国人民一样，我们古巴人也曾经、而且正在对阻碍与危害各国人民的封建和帝国主义反动派作斗争。我们的国家地小，经济不发达，地理上又靠近历史上最富侵略性的资本主义与帝国主义的国家，但是我们的国家看清了它的道路，并在世界各国人民的支援之下，高举独立、发展经济、政治主权、各国共处与和平交流的旗帜。这个为美好的未来而所做的共同努力——这是各国人民之间的友谊与团结的最纯洁的源泉——就使古巴共和国政府与中华人民共和国政府建立正式外交关系的行动具有历史的意义。阁下，关于两国人民之间的兄弟关系，大家都知道是很久以来就存在的。
    上世纪中叶，成千上万的中国人被带到了古巴，他们陷于半奴隶的境遇。他们中间有很多人以后参加了我国人民在1868和1895年所进行的独立战争。共和国建立以后，同样有不少的人留居下来或者还有不少的人继续到我国去，以他们自己勤劳和诚恳的工作建立了与我们的血液交融在一起的家园。副主席阁下，这就是说，中国人民和古巴人民的兄弟情谊已经存在了一个多世纪，这是在共同反抗剥削、进行争取独立的爱国斗争和日常的友爱相处中建立起来的真正的兄弟情谊。现在可以说这种情谊已经达到了更为完满的地步。贵国政府已向我国政府伸出了支援的手，我国政府带着感谢的心情，握住了这只手，并盼望这只不过是贸易、文化与友谊的频繁的交流的开始。对于我个人说来，自然，为巩固与发展这种有利于双方的美好前景而工作是再高兴、再荣幸也不过的事了。此外，在我的工作中，有古巴人民友好与热情的支持。不到三个月之前，在革命的全国大会上，根据以《哈瓦那宣言》命名的文件，古巴人民决定与那个窃夺贵国代表权的傀儡政权断绝关系，并与贵国合法的、真正是人民的政府正式建立关系。副主席阁下，我将努力来完成这样崇高的职责。并相信我的工作能得到很好的成绩，其保证就是您的信任，您们美好的愿望以及您们可贵的合作。
    古巴共和国总统先生奥斯瓦耳多·多尔蒂科斯·托拉多博士和我国革命政府总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗博士要我转达他们对中华人民共和国的幸福和进步的关切，转达他们对阁下及贵国政府成员的幸福和伟大的贵国的繁荣发展的最衷心的祝愿，我本人也愿趁此表示这种诚挚的祝愿。
    宋庆龄副主席致答词说：大使先生：
    我很高兴地接受阁下被任命为古巴共和国驻中华人民共和国第一任特命全权大使的国书，并且感谢阁下对我国人民和我本人的友好祝贺。我愿意趁此机会通过大使阁下向多尔蒂科斯总统阁下和菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理阁下表达中国人民和我本人的真诚的敬意。中国人民一向以十分钦佩的心情关注着古巴人民反对美帝国主义的侵略和干涉、维护民族独立和国家主权的英勇斗争。中国政府和中国人民将尽一切可能支援古巴人民的正义斗争，并且相信古巴人民的正义斗争一定会取得彻底的胜利。
    中古两国虽然相距万里，但是两国人民在反对帝国主义的斗争中早就建立了深厚的友谊。美帝国主义曾经制造种种障碍，来阻挠中古两国关系的正常发展，但是赢得了各自的民族独立的中古两国人民，终于粉碎了人为的障碍，建立起新的友好合作关系。中国人民十分珍视这种友好合作关系，并且相信，这种关系必将日益巩固和发展。中国和古巴是两个爱好和平的国家。我们两国之间的友好合作，不仅有利于加强亚洲人民和拉丁美洲人民间的友谊，而且必将对维护和巩固世界和平作出重大的贡献。
    大使先生，我热烈地欢迎阁下出任古巴共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使。在阁下为发展中古两国友好合作的工作中，将会得到我和中华人民共和国政府的充分合作和支持。
    谨祝贵国国家繁荣，人民兴旺，并祝多尔蒂科斯总统阁下和菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理阁下健康！
    新华社上海26日电　中华人民共和国副主席宋庆龄，今天接见了古巴共和国首任驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯和夫人以及大使馆一等秘书塞西尼奥·马丁内斯·奥尔特加，并和他们亲切地交谈。
    接见时在座的有：我国外交部副部长章汉夫、礼宾司副司长葛步海、美澳司副司长林平和上海市副市长刘述周等。
    接见后，宋庆龄副主席设便宴招待了奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯大使等。（附图片）
