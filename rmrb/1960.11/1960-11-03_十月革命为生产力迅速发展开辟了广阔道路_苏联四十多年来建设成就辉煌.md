    The October Revolution Opened Up Broad Prospects for Rapid Development of Productive Forces
    Brilliant Construction Achievements of the Soviet Union Over the Past Forty Years
    Total industrial output value reached forty times that of 1913; agricultural production increased by more than double.
    Industrial development rate is more than three times faster than that of the United States; output of many products exceeds that of the United States.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd - In the decades since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has developed its national economy at a rate impossible under the capitalist system. By the end of last year, its total industrial output value had increased to forty times that of 1913 before the October Revolution, and the total agricultural output value had nearly increased to 2.2 times. National income has nearly increased to twenty-five times.
    Through the development of the past few decades, the Soviet Union has been built into an advanced and prosperous socialist country. According to statistical materials recently published in the Soviet press, the value of products produced by Soviet industry in one year is now approximately as high as 1,500 billion rubles. Calculated at current prices, the output value increased in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period last year (nearly 100 billion rubles) is more than double the total industrial output value of Russia in the entire year before the October Revolution. The average annual total agricultural output value, calculated at comparable prices, was about 300 billion rubles during the period from 1949 to 1953; and reached more than 400 billion rubles during the period from 1954 to 1958. Various industrial and agricultural products have increased greatly compared with before the revolution. Last year, the total output of pig iron, steel, steel products, iron ore, petroleum, and coal had increased to more than ten to seventeen times that of 1913; while the output of electric power, the chemical industry, and the machine manufacturing industry had increased by more than 138 times, 150 times, and 270 times, respectively. Among the main agricultural products, grain output has increased from 5.3 billion poods (one pood equals 32.76 catties) in 1913 before the October Revolution to 7.6 billion poods in 1959; raw cotton from 740,000 tons to 4.7 million tons, and milk from 29.4 million tons to 62 million tons.
    In the past few decades, the Soviet working people have overcome various difficulties in socialist construction to develop the national economy and change the situation in which the past economic level was decades to hundreds of years behind developed capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France. From 1918 to 1958, the Soviet Union invested a total of 2,414 billion rubles in various sectors of the national economy to vigorously carry out construction. As a result, from 1929, when the first five-year plan began, to 1959, more than 30,000 large industrial enterprises were newly built and expanded throughout the country, dozens of new industrial sectors that did not exist before the revolution were established, and many new industrial centers and industrial bases were established. Due to the continuous development of production and construction, the basic production funds in Soviet industry have more than doubled in the nineteen years before this year alone. Great results have also been achieved in various aspects of basic construction in agriculture. By the end of last year, the basic production funds of collective farms and state farms nationwide had increased by two times and four times respectively compared with 1940.
    Relying on constantly increasing economic strength and the heroic labor of the Soviet people, during the era of Soviet power, the Soviet Union was able to develop production at a much faster rate than Tsarist Russia and capitalist countries. For example, in the forty-two years from 1917 to 1959, the Soviet Union increased its total industrial output value by an average of 10.1% per year. This is more than twice as fast as the average annual growth rate of industry during the particularly smooth forty-two years (1872 to 1913) of Tsarist Russia; and more than three times as fast as the average annual growth rate of American industry in the most recent forty-two years. According to calculations by the famous American economist Perlo, the current absolute annual increase in Soviet industrial production, as a whole, is almost equal to twice that of the United States. In agriculture, taking the most important agricultural product—grain—as an example, the average annual growth rate of Soviet grain in the most recent six years has been more than twice that of the United States. Such a rate of development has enabled the Soviet Union to change the backward face left over from Tsarist Russia in a short period of time, and to catch up with and surpass economically developed capitalist countries one after another in terms of economic level. In the past two or three years alone, the Soviet Union has caught up with and surpassed the United States in terms of total output in seven important products, namely: coal, iron ore, reinforced concrete components, woolen fabrics, sugar, milk, and animal fats. By 1959, the Soviet Union's coal production was 117.5 million tons more than that of the United States, and its iron ore production was 24.4 million tons more.
    On the basis of existing achievements, the current Soviet national economy is advancing along the road of communist construction. The seven-year plan (1959-1965), which is currently being implemented, will push the Soviet national economy to new heights in this regard. Judging from the situation of the Soviet working people implementing the seven-year plan in the past year or so, this plan will be successfully realized.

    十月革命为生产力迅速发展开辟了广阔道路
    苏联四十多年来建设成就辉煌
    工业总产值达到1913年的四十倍　农业生产增长一倍多
    工业发展速度比美国快三倍多　许多产品产量超过美国
    新华社莫斯科2日电　在十月革命以来的几十年中，苏联以资本主义制度下不可能有的速度发展了国民经济。到去年年底，它的工业总产值已经增加为十月革命前1913年的四十倍，农业总产值将近增加为二点二倍。国民收入将近增加为二十五倍。
    经过过去几十年的发展，苏联已经建设成为一个先进富强的社会主义国家。据苏联报刊最近期间发表的统计材料，目前，苏联工业在一年中生产的产品的价值大约高达一万五千亿卢布，按目前的价格计算，单是今年头九个月比去年同期增加的产值（将近一千亿卢布），就比十月革命前俄国全年的工业总产值多一倍以上。每年平均的农业总产值，按比较价格计算，在1949年到1953年期间为三千亿卢布左右；在1954至1958年期间达到四千亿卢布以上。各种工农业产品，都比革命前有了巨大的增长。去年，生铁、钢、钢材、铁矿砂、石油和煤的总产量已增加为1913年的十倍到十七倍以上；而电力、化学工业和机器制造工业的产量分别增加为一百三十八倍、一百五十倍和二百七十倍以上。在主要农产品中，谷物产量已从十月革命前1913年的五十三亿普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）增加为1959年的七十六亿普特；原棉从七十四万吨增加为四百七十万吨，牛奶从二千九百四十万吨增为六千二百万吨。
    苏联劳动人民在过去几十年中，克服了社会主义建设中的各种困难，来发展国民经济，改变过去经济水平要比美、英、法等发达的资本主义国家落后几十年到成百年的状况。从1918至1958年期间，苏联总共向国民经济各部门投资二万四千一百四十亿卢布，大力进行建设。结果，从第一个五年计划开始时的1929年至1959年期间，就在全国各地新建和扩建了三万多个大工业企业，建立了几十个革命前所没有过的新工业部门，许多新工业中心和工业基地。由于生产和建设工作的不断发展，仅仅在今年以前的十九年内，苏联工业中的基本生产基金就增加了两倍以上。农业中各方面基本建设也取得了很大成果，到去年年底全国集体农庄和国营农场的基本生产基金就比1940年分别增加了两倍和四倍。
    依靠不断增强的经济力量和苏联人民的英雄劳动，在苏维埃政权年代中，苏联才能以比沙皇俄国和资本主义国家快得多的速度来发展生产。例如，从1917年到1959年的四十二年间，苏联就使它的工业总产值每年平均增长10.1％。这比沙皇俄国发展特别顺利的四十二年
  （1872到1913年）间工业每年平均增长速度快一倍以上；比最近四十二年美国工业每年平均增长速度快三倍多。据美国著名经济学家佩洛计算，目前，苏联工业生产每年的绝对增长额，整个说来，已差不多等于美国的两倍。在农业方面，以最重要的农产品——谷物为例，在最近六年间，苏联谷物每年平均增长速度就比美国快一倍以上。这样的发展速度使苏联在不长的时间内改变了过去沙皇俄国遗留下来的落后的面貌，并在经济水平上一个接一个地赶上和超过经济发达的资本主义国家。仅仅在过去两、三年内，苏联在总产量上赶上和超过美国的就有七种重要产品，即：煤、铁矿砂、钢筋混凝土构件、毛织品、砂糖、牛奶和动物油脂。到1959年，苏联的煤产量已比美国多一亿一千七百五十万吨，铁矿砂多二千四百四十万吨。
    在现有成就的基础上，目前苏联国民经济正沿着共产主义建设的大道前进。现在正在执行着的七年计划（1959—1965年），将在这方面把苏联国民经济推向新的高度。从最近一年多来苏联劳动人民执行七年计划的情况看来，这一计划将会胜利地实现。
