Xinhua News Agency, November 29th. Speech by Albanian Ambassador to China, Piro Pirofti, at a reception celebrating the 16th anniversary of Albania's liberation: Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, dear comrades and friends, ladies and gentlemen:

Today, the Albanian people celebrate the 16th anniversary of their permanent liberation from the dual rule of imperialist exploitation and domestic feudal bourgeois oppression. This great victory of the Albanian people was achieved under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party, now the Albanian Labor Party, headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, after five years of continuous bloody struggle, and with the historic victory of the glorious Soviet Army in defeating German Nazis. This year, along with the 16th anniversary of liberation, our people are also celebrating the 48th anniversary of their independence. Forty-eight years ago, on November 28, 1912, Albania declared freedom and independence after enduring nearly five centuries of heavy and cruel Turkish rule.

This year, the Albanian people attach even greater importance to celebrating these two great national anniversaries because this year is also the final year of the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of our people's economy and culture. The Party’s Fourth Congress will also be convened this year, at which the guidelines for the Third Five-Year Plan will be adopted.

The results of the Albanian people's peaceful and constructive labor are great and brilliant. In these sixteen years, Albania, which was once the poorest and most backward country in Europe, with a weak economy, almost no industry, primitive agriculture, 80% of its residents being illiterate, a semi-colonial country, and a currency subject to imperialist transactions, has today become a free, autonomous, and socialist country with economic and cultural development.

Due to the victorious completion of the First and Second Five-Year Plans, our production capacity has increased far beyond what it used to be. Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country and is moving forward with rapid and firm steps toward turning our country into an industrial-agricultural country. The total industrial output value in 1960 will increase by 113% compared to 1955, while the figure stipulated by the Party's Third Congress was only 92%. During the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), the average annual growth rate of total industrial output was 16.3%, while the task stipulated by the Party Congress was only 14%. The biggest achievement in agriculture is that the task of agricultural collectivization was basically completed one year ahead of schedule during the Second Five-Year Plan. Today, throughout our country, except for remote mountainous areas, agricultural cooperatives have been established in other areas, accounting for 85% of all cultivated land by farmers. The socialist sector of agriculture now accounts for 92% of the total cultivated land in the republic. In this way, the socialist economic foundation of the countryside has been built, and at the same time, reliable prospects have been opened up for the faster development of our agriculture in the future. Such achievements have also been achieved in other areas, for example, in 1960-1961, the number of students in various types of schools in our country, including universities, middle schools, and primary schools, reached 300,000, while before liberation there were only about 56,650. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the first university in the history of Albania was established, namely the Tirana State University, which now has 5,000 students. Due to the attainment of these achievements, the material and cultural level of the Albanian people has been improved.

Even more magnificent and brighter prospects have been opened up for the Albanian people. The Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, which will be held in December, will adopt the guidelines for the Third Five-Year Plan. This plan stipulates that the country's production capacity should be further strengthened and the material and cultural living standards of the working people should be improved. The new Five-Year Plan will be an important step in transforming our country into an industrial-agricultural country and strengthening the material and technological foundations of our socialism. It is planned that by 1965, the total industrial output value will increase by 51% compared to 1960, accounting for 53.4% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. It is estimated that by 1965, the total output value of agriculture and animal husbandry will increase by 64% compared to 1960. Compared with the Second Five-Year Plan, investment is expected to increase by 47% and construction will increase by 59% during the next Five-Year Plan. The amount of construction from 1961 to 1965 will be equal to the amount of construction in the fifteen years after liberation.

While our economy and culture are being strengthened, Albania's international prestige has also been enhanced. Due to its consistent adherence to a peaceful foreign policy, the People's Republic of Albania has become an important factor in maintaining peace in the Balkans and Europe. Albania's foreign policy has been, and still is, a policy of peace and friendship with the people of all countries. To serve this purpose, the government of the People's Republic of Albania has consistently devoted itself to turning the Balkans and the Adriatic Sea into a peaceful, nuclear-weapon-free zone, and has consistently supported the Soviet government's constructive proposals on easing international tension, complete and thorough disarmament, and new proposals for eliminating the evil colonialist system. The government of the People's Republic of Albania, in the past and in the future, will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations and participate in various other organizations and international conferences, because today no international problem can be solved without the participation of People's China. It also supports the just struggle for national liberation of other countries whose people are still under colonial rule. At the same time, the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Party, will never weaken their revolutionary vigilance. On the contrary, they must be doubly vigilant, and as in the past, they must continue to labor and build with a pick in one hand and a gun in the other, because the enemies of the freedom and peace of the people of all countries, first of all the US imperialism, the number one enemy of the people of all countries today, and its tools in the Balkans, have not abandoned their war-mongering and aggressive plans. The Albanian people will never be deceived by the sweet words and deceptive propaganda that imperialism sometimes uses when forced by the pressure of the people. As our proverb says, "The wolf may change its hair, but not its hide." This sentence is completely in line with imperialism and its nature.

Dear comrades, the achievements that the Albanian people have obtained so far should be attributed to their persistent labor and selfless spirit, and should be attributed to their great patriotism. The Albanian people attribute the attainment of these achievements first of all to their Marxist-Leninist party and its correct and reliable leadership. The Albanian Labor Party has been characterized by its unwavering loyalty to Marxism-Leninism since its establishment. Based on the immortal Marxist-Leninist thought, the Albanian Labor Party has led the Albanian people from victory to victory in the past and present. Therefore, in the future, our party must always be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, and together with other Marxist-Leninist brother parties, spare no effort to defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, oppose all non-Marxist-Leninist tendencies, especially modern revisionism as pointed out in the 1957 Moscow Declaration—the main danger to Marxism-Leninism and the communist workers' movement worldwide. In the future, our party will also carry out a principled struggle against the Yugoslav revisionism, the bearer of the tattered banner of modern revisionism, and regard this struggle as a primary internationalist task.

Dear comrades, the achievements of our people are the result of the friendship and close cooperation between our people and the people of other brotherly countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. They are the result of their, especially the great Soviet brotherly people's, continuous fraternal assistance to our country. Precisely because of this, the Albanian people, under the teachings of their party, will forever maintain and consolidate the friendship and unity of the brotherly people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in the future, based on the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

In socialist construction, the Albanian people have received valuable assistance from the Chinese people. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Party, and the government of the People's Republic of Albania, to express our greatest and deepest gratitude to the Chinese people, the Party, and the government of the People's Republic of China for this fraternal internationalist assistance.

Dear comrades, the Albanian people are infinitely excited by the new achievements that the fraternal Chinese people are making every day under the reliable leadership of their glorious Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. The speed of development of the national economy and culture of the People's Republic of China is unprecedented in Chinese history. The degree of national industrialization is developing rapidly, agriculture is advancing and moving towards modernization, and culture, art, and science are flourishing. The People's Republic of China is transforming itself into an increasingly powerful socialist country with giant strides—a great pillar of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. As a result of the People's Republic of China's consistent adherence to a peaceful policy and the implementation of the principles of peaceful coexistence, the People's Republic of China has become a decisive factor in maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Its prestige on the international stage and the love of the people of other countries for it have increased. Dear comrades, the achievements of your people demonstrate the correctness of your party's policy. They are the fruits of the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. Great, strong, and unbreakable friendship links the Albanian people with the fraternal Chinese people, and this friendship is built on the basis of Marxist-Leninist thought and proletarian internationalism. Our people wholeheartedly rejoice in the achievements of your great and talented people, and we gain encouragement and inspiration from them in our daily work and struggle. The Albanian people are happy and proud to have such a great and loyal friend as the Chinese people. You can believe that you also have such a small but loyal friend as Albania.

As I conclude this speech, please raise your glasses to the great, strong, and eternal friendship between the Albanian and Chinese peoples—a friendship that grows and develops on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, to maintaining and further consolidating the unity of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union—a guarantee of world peace, to the friendship and peace of the peoples of all countries! Please raise your glasses to new and greater achievements for the fraternal People's Republic of China, to Comrade Liu Shaoqi, President of the Republic, to the glorious Communist Party of China, the teacher and organizer of all the victories of the fraternal Chinese people, to the Chairman of the Party, a dear friend of the Albanian people, the outstanding Marxist Mao Zedong, cheers!

    同现代修正主义进行坚决斗争是一项首要的国际主义的任务
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使帕里夫蒂在招待会上的讲话
    新华社29日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使帕里夫蒂在庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十六周年招待会上的讲话。亲爱的毛泽东同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们，女士们、先生们：
    今天阿尔巴尼亚人民庆祝他从帝国主义的剥削和国内封建资产阶级压迫的双重统治下，获得永远的解放的十六周年国庆日。阿尔巴尼亚人民的这个伟大的胜利，是在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚共产党即今天的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，作了五年连续的浴血奋战，并在光荣的苏军击败德国纳粹的历史性胜利下获得的。今年，在解放十六周年的同时，我国人民也庆祝它的独立四十八周年。四十八年以前，即1912年11月28日，阿尔巴尼亚在经受了近五百年之久土耳其的沉重和凶恶的统治以后，宣布了自由和独立。
    今年阿尔巴尼亚人民更特别重视庆祝这两个伟大的国庆周年，因为今年也是发展我国人民经济和文化的第二个五年计划的最后一年，同时党的第四次代表大会也将召开，在这个大会上将要通过第三个五年计划的指示。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和平的和建设性的劳动成果是伟大而光辉的。在这十六年内，以前曾是欧洲最贫穷落后的、经济衰弱、几乎没有工业、农业原始、80％居民是文盲的阿尔巴尼亚，一个半殖民地和沦为帝国主义交易的货币的国家，今天已变成了一个自由、自主以及经济文化发展的社会主义国家。
    由于第一和第二个五年计划的胜利完成，我国生产能力已远非昔比地提高了。阿尔巴尼亚已从一个落后的农业国变成了一个农业—工业国，并正在以迅速坚定的步伐向着把我国变成一个工业—农业国前进。1960年的工业总产值和1955年相比将增长113％，而党的第三次代表大会规定的数字仅92％，在第二个五年计划（1956—1960）中，工业总产量平均每年的增长速度为16.3％，而党代大会规定的任务只有14％。农业方面最大的成就是在第二个五年计划中已提前一年基本上完成了农业集体化任务。今天在我们全国，除了荒山僻岭的地区以外，其他地区均已建立了农业合作社，占全部农民耕地的85％。而农业社会主义部门已占全共和国耕地的92％。这样，农村社会主义经济基础建成了，与此同时，为今后我国农业将来更快的发展开辟了可靠的前景。在其他方面也获得了这样的成就，例如在1960—1961年内，我国的各类学校的大、中、小在校学生达三十万名，而在解放前仅有大约五万六千六百五十名。第二个五年计划期间，在阿尔巴尼亚历史上建立了第一所大学，即现在拥有五千名大学生的地拉那国立大学。由于这些成就的获得，阿尔巴尼亚人民的物质和文化水平提高了。
    今后更加宏伟和更加光明的前景已为阿尔巴尼亚人民打开。将在12月召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会要通过第三个五年计划的指示，该计划规定要进一步加强我国的生产能力和提高劳动人民的物质文化水平，新五年计划将是把我国变成一个工业—农业国以及加强我国社会主义物质技术基础中的一个重要步骤。计划到1965年，工业总产值将比1960年增加51％，它在工农业总产值中占的比重将达53.4％。预计到1965年农牧业的总产值将比1960年增长64％。和第二个五年计划相比，在未来的五年计划期间，投资预计将增长47％，建筑将增长59％；从1961至1965年期间的建筑量将和解放后十五年的建筑量相等。
    在我国经济和文化加强的同时，阿尔巴尼亚的国际威望也提高了。由于始终不渝地奉行和平外交政策，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国已成为巴尔干和欧洲维护和平的重要因素。阿尔巴尼亚的外交政策过去是、现在也是和平的、同各国人民友好的政策。为服务于这一目的，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府一贯致力于把巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区变成一个和平的无原子武器的地区，并一贯支持苏联政府关于缓和国际紧张局势、全面彻底裁军的建设性的建议以及消灭万恶的殖民主义体系的新建议。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，过去和将来，都坚决维护中华人民共和国进入联合国和参加其他各种组织和国际会议的合法权利，因为今天如果没有人民中国的参加，就无法解决任何国际问题。它还支持至今仍受殖民统治的其他各国人民，为民族解放而作正义的斗争。与此同时，阿尔巴尼亚人民，在党的领导下，决不削弱革命的警惕性，相反要加倍地警惕，和过去那样，它继续要一手拿镐一手拿枪来劳动和建设，因为各国人民自由与和平的敌人，首先是当前各国人民头号敌人的美帝国主义及其在巴尔干的工具，并未放弃他们的好战和侵略的计划。阿尔巴尼亚人民决不为帝国主义由于在人民的压力下有时被迫而使用的花言巧语和欺骗宣传所迷惑。我国的一句谚语说得好：“狼毛可换，狼皮不变”。这句话完全符合帝国主义和它的本性。
    亲爱的同志们，到目前为止，阿尔巴尼亚人民获得的成就，应归功于他们坚持不渝的劳动和忘我的精神，应归功于他们伟大的爱国主义精神。阿尔巴尼亚人民把这些成就的获得首先归于他们的马克思列宁主义的党及其正确可靠的领导。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党自建立以来的特点是对马列主义的毫不动摇的忠诚。在不朽的马列主义思想基础上，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党过去和现在一直领导阿尔巴尼亚人民从胜利走向胜利。因此，在今后，我们的党也要永远忠于马克思列宁主义，并且要和其他马列主义的兄弟党一起，毫不吝惜自己的力量，为保卫马列主义的纯洁性、反对一切非马列主义的倾向，特别反对如1957年莫斯科宣言指出的现代修正主义——马列主义和全世界共产主义工人运动的主要危险。我们的党在今后还将为反对现代修正主义破烂旗手的南斯拉夫修正主义而进行原则性的斗争，并把这一斗争看成是一项首要的国际主义的任务。
    亲爱的同志们，我国人民的成就是我国人民和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营其他兄弟人民的友谊和无间的合作的果实，是他们，特别是伟大的苏联兄弟人民对我国不断的兄弟般的援助的结果。正因为这样，阿尔巴尼亚人民在他们党的教导下，永远依据马列主义和无产阶级国际主义的不朽原则，在今后也要进一步维护和巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营兄弟人民的友谊和团结。
    在社会主义建设中，阿尔巴尼亚人民从中国人民那里得到了宝贵的援助。我谨借此机会，代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，向中国人民、党和中华人民共和国政府表示最大的、深切的感谢，感谢你们这种兄弟般的国际主义的援助。
    亲爱的同志们，阿尔巴尼亚人民为兄弟中国人民在其光荣的共产党和毛泽东主席的可靠领导下，每天获得的新的成就而感到无限兴奋。中华人民共和国的国民经济和文化的发展速度是中国人民历史上没有先例的。国家工业化程度正在迅速发展，农业在前进，并走向现代化，文化、艺术和科学正在繁荣。中华人民共和国正在以巨人的步伐把自己变成日益强大的社会主义国家——以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大的支柱。由于中华人民共和国一贯奉行和平政策和贯彻执行和平共处原则的结果，中华人民共和国已变成了亚洲和全世界维护和平的决定性的因素，它在国际舞台上的威信以及其他国家人民对它的热爱都增加了。亲爱的同志们，你们人民的成就表明了你们党的政策的正确性。它们是你们党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社的三面红旗的果实。伟大的、坚强的、牢不可破的友谊把阿尔巴尼亚人民和兄弟的中国人民联在一起，这一友谊是建筑在马列主义思想和无产阶级国际主义基础之上的。我国人民衷心地为你们伟大的天才的人民的成就而高兴，在我们每日的工作和斗争中，我们从这里获得了鼓舞和启发。阿尔巴尼亚人民为有中国人民这样一个伟大的忠诚的朋友而高兴和自豪。你们可以相信，你们也有阿尔巴尼亚这样很小的然而是忠诚的朋友。
    在我结束这个讲话的时候，请你们举杯，为阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民之间的伟大的、坚强的、永恒的友谊——在马列主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上成长和发展的友谊，为维护和进一步巩固以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的团结——维护世界和平的保证，为各国人民的友谊和和平而干杯！请举杯，为兄弟中华人民共和国获得新的更大的成就，为共和国主席刘少奇同志，为兄弟中国人民的一切胜利的教导者和组织者光荣的中国共产党，为党的主席、阿尔巴尼亚人民亲爱的朋友、卓越的马克思主义者毛泽东同志，干杯！
