Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 3rd — The first sports meet in the Tibet Region, after fifteen days of competition, closed on October 30th.

This sports meet included over forty events in track and field, ball games, and shooting, producing gratifying results. Among them, five athletes, Zaxi Luobu, Zhuoga Qunzong, Ma Fenglan, Luo Yacuo, and Gao Wenxue, set six new Tibetan regional records in men's hand grenade, men's javelin, women's hand grenade, women's discus, women's 100 meters, and women's 200 meters. In shooting and track and field events, sixty-seven athletes reached the required standards to be ranked.

This sports meet reflects the rapid growth of new forces in Tibetan sports and also reflects that mass sports activities in Tibet have been gradually developed. Nearly a quarter of the nearly one thousand athletes participating in this sports meet were emancipated young male and female farmers and herdsmen. In a short period of time, they humbly practiced and painstakingly studied, and have already created excellent results.

Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and Director of the Tibet Sports Commission, spoke at the closing ceremony. He said that this meeting laid a good foundation for Tibet to carry out mass amateur sports activities more deeply, more comprehensively, and more extensively in the future. He said that in the future, Tibet should pay special attention to developing horse racing, archery, and other activities with excellent national traditions in carrying out mass amateur sports activities, in order to enhance the physical fitness of the broad masses of working people.

The conference presented award flags and certificates to thirty-six collectives and one hundred and forty-seven individuals who achieved outstanding results in this sports meet.

Basketball, volleyball, and football exhibition matches were held after the meeting.

    新华社拉萨3日电　西藏地区第一届体育运动大会经过十五天的比赛，已在10月30日闭幕。
    这次运动会进行了田径、球类及射击等四十多个项目的比赛，创造了可喜的成绩。其中有扎西洛布、卓嘎群宗、马凤兰、洛亚措姆、高文学等五名运动员，创造了男子手榴弹、男子标枪、女子手榴弹、女子铁饼、女子百米和二百米等六项西藏地区的新纪录。在射击和田径赛中，涌现出了六十七名等级运动员。
    这次运动会反映了西藏体育运动的新生力量正在迅速成长，也反映了西藏群众性的体育活动已经逐步开展起来。参加这次运动会的近千名运动员中，有将近四分之一是翻身的青年男女农牧民。他们在短短的时间里，虚心练习，刻苦钻研，已经创造出很好的成绩。
    中共西藏工委副书记、西藏体育运动委员会主任谭冠三在闭幕式上讲了话。他说，这次大会为西藏今后更深入、更全面、更广泛地开展群众性的业余体育运动，打下了良好的基础。他说，今后西藏在开展群众性的业余体育运动中，特别要发展具有优良民族传统的跑马、射箭等活动，以增强广大劳动人民的体质。
    大会向在这次运动大会上创造优异成绩的三十六个集体和一百四十七个个人颁发了奖旗和奖状。
