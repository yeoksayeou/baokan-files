Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: A grand meeting commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of world cultural figure Leo Tolstoy was held in the capital on the evening of the 25th.

    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, delivered a speech first at the meeting. He said that Tolstoy engaged in more than half a century of literary creation, creating a large number of works with high artistic value. This great writer represented a transition period from feudal society to capitalist society in the Tsarist Russian era, becoming the mouthpiece of Russian peasants of that period. Through his genius art, he exposed and criticized the Russian aristocratic landlord class and fiercely criticized the capitalist system. These are the progressive aspects of Tolstoy as a critical realist. However, due to the limitations of the times and his class, Tolstoy inevitably exposed the contradictions in his worldview in his works.

    Guo Moruo said that today, as we commemorate Tolstoy, we should use the viewpoints and methods of Marxism-Leninism to critically accept this valuable literary heritage, absorb its essence, and oppose any distortion and utilization of Tolstoy by bourgeois reactionary writers and modern revisionists. We must carry forward Tolstoy's hatred of feudalism, capitalism, and imperialism, his love for the motherland and the people, and his deep sympathy and care for the oppressed people in colonies and semi-colonies, in a new sense and under new historical conditions. We must absorb Tolstoy's realist art to nourish and enrich our literature, improve our artistic skills, and create great works that reflect our great era.

    Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, pointed out in his report that Tolstoy's life was one of a fierce protester, an angry exposer, and a great critic. Tolstoy was an artistic master who broadly and multi-dimensionally reflected reality. He listed a large number of novels with profound content on contemporary social life written by Tolstoy in nearly sixty years of creative activity and talked about Tolstoy's ruthless exposure and protest against the landlord and bourgeois society, the Tsarist autocracy, and the official church with "the most sober realism" and the unique technique of tearing up all masks.

    Mao Dun pointed out in his report that when the broad laboring people of Russia were gathering strength to prepare for the decisive battle against the Tsarist autocracy, Tolstoy's exposure and criticism of the reactionary ruling class were undoubtedly of progressive significance. It was a serious blow to the reactionary forces and a contribution to the liberation movement. However, due to the limitations of the historical era and his class on Tolstoy's worldview, his criticism started from the perspective of the peasants under the patriarchal system. Mao Dun said that although Tolstoy's thoughts expressed in his works have great defects, his merits outweigh his defects. His creation still makes people think deeply, excites people, and still shines with immortal light.

    Mao Dun said that Tolstoy is one of the most beloved foreign writers among the broad readership in our country, and his works have been circulating in our country for fifty years. Today, when people commemorate this genius artist with unparalleled respect, the feudal system and capitalist system that he deeply hated have not only been uprooted on a quarter of the globe but also the days when they will be finally eliminated within the entire world are not far off. Facing such an era, we should create more and better works and contribute to the great cause of defending world peace and striving for democracy and socialism.

    Sudalikov, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, said in his speech that China's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Tolstoy's death, with its large scale and grand ceremony, once again proves that only the people of socialist countries who are at the forefront of all advanced mankind are the true preservers and promoters of progressive ideas and civilization in the world. He pointed out that Tolstoy not only firmly opposed the cruel system of Tsarist Russia with a fearless attitude but also exposed the plundering nature of the policies of many imperialist countries and carried out a heroic struggle against the social injustice and the parasitic life of the exploiters' society, thus deeply loved by the upright ordinary people all over the world. Sudalikov pointed out that Tolstoy was unable to understand the correct path of social transformation, and his worldview contained huge contradictions, and his progressiveness was not thorough enough. But this does not detract from Tolstoy's greatness as a genius writer of the Russian land and as a vivid expression of mankind's yearning for freedom and happiness.

    Among those who attended the memorial meeting today were people from all walks of life in the capital: Chu Tunan, Ding Xilin, Yang Hansheng, Xu Guangping, Xia Yan, Lao She, Shao Quanlin, Liu Baiyu, and others.

    Also attending the memorial meeting were personnel from the Soviet Embassy in China and peace activists in Beijing.

    Today's memorial meeting was jointly organized by the China Peace Committee, the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Writers Association.

    和大和对外文化协会等单位联合举行大会
    隆重纪念托尔斯泰逝世五十周年
    据新华社25日讯　世界文化名人列·尼·托尔斯泰逝世五十周年纪念大会于25日晚在首都隆重举行。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席、中苏友好协会总会副会长、中国文学艺术界联合会主席郭沫若在会上首先致词。他说，托尔斯泰从事了半世纪以上的文学创作活动，创作了大量的有高度艺术价值的作品。这位伟大的作家代表了帝俄时代由封建社会到资本主义社会的一个过渡时期，成为那个时期俄国农民的喉舌。通过他的天才的艺术，揭露和抨击了俄国的贵族地主阶级，也猛烈地抨击了资本主义制度，这些是作为批判的现实主义者的托尔斯泰的进步的一面。但是托尔斯泰由于受着时代和阶级的限制，在作品里也不能不暴露出他的世界观的矛盾。
    郭沫若说，我们今天纪念托尔斯泰，应该用马克思列宁主义的观点和方法，来批判地接受这份宝贵的文学遗产，吸取其精华，反对资产阶级反动文人和现代修正主义者对托尔斯泰的任何歪曲和利用。我们要把托尔斯泰对封建主义、资本主义、帝国主义的痛恨，对祖国和人民的热爱，对殖民地、半殖民地被压迫人民的深切同情和关怀，在新的意义上，在新的历史条件下，加以发扬光大；要吸取托尔斯泰的现实主义的艺术，来营养和丰富我们的文学，提高我们的艺术技巧，创造出反映我们这个伟大时代的伟大作品。
    中国作家协会主席茅盾在报告中指出，托尔斯泰的一生，是一个激烈的抗议者、愤怒的揭发者、伟大的批判者的一生。托尔斯泰是广阔地多方面地反映现实的艺术巨匠。他列举了托尔斯泰在将近六十年的创作活动中写下的大量以当代社会生活为题材的内容深刻的小说，谈到了托尔斯泰以“最清醒的现实主义”的态度，以无情地撕毁一切假面具的独特手法，对地主资产阶级社会、沙皇专制制度和官方教会所做的无情的揭露和抗议。
    茅盾在报告中指出，当俄国的广大劳动人民正在积聚力量准备投入反对沙皇专制制度的决战时，托尔斯泰对反动统治阶级的揭露和批判无疑的是有进步意义的，是对反动势力的严重打击，是对解放运动的贡献。但是，由于托尔斯泰的世界观受着历史时代和阶级的限制，他的批判是从宗法制度下农民的观点出发的。茅盾说，尽管托尔斯泰在作品中表现出来的思想有着很大的缺陷，但是瑕不掩瑜，他的创作仍旧发人深思，使人激动，仍旧闪耀着不灭的光芒。
    茅盾说，托尔斯泰是我国广大读者最喜爱的外国作家之一，他的作品在我国已经流传五十年。今天，当人们怀着无比崇敬的心情来纪念这位天才艺术家的时候，他所深恶痛绝的封建制度、资本主义制度不仅在全球四分之一的地面上已经被连根拔掉，而且在整个世界范围内最后消灭的日子也为期不远了。面临这样的时代，我们应该创造出更多更好的作品，为保卫世界和平、争取民主和社会主义的伟大事业贡献力量。
    苏联驻华大使馆临时代办苏达利柯夫在讲话中说，中国纪念托尔斯泰逝世五十周年，规模之大和仪式的隆重，再一次证明，只有走在全体先进人类前列的各社会主义国家的人民才是世界进步的思想和文明的真正的保存者和发扬者。他指出，托尔斯泰不仅非常坚决地以无畏的态度反对沙皇俄国的残酷制度，而且还揭露了许多帝国主义国家的政策的掠夺本质，对社会上的不公平和剥削者社会的寄生生活进行了英勇的斗争，因此深受全世界正直的普通人的敬爱。苏达利柯夫指出，托尔斯泰没有能够了解社会改造的正确途径，他的世界观包含着巨大的矛盾，而在进步的方面也不够彻底。但是这无损于托尔斯泰作为俄罗斯土地的天才作家、作为人类向往自由和幸福的鲜明的表现者的伟大。
    今天参加纪念会的有首都各界人士：楚图南、丁西林、阳翰笙、许广平、夏衍、老舍、邵荃麟、刘白羽等。
    参加纪念会的还有苏联驻华大使馆人员和在京的和平人士。
    今天的纪念大会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中苏友好协会总会、中国文学艺术界联合会和中国作家协会联合举办的。
