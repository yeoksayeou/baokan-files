    To the Most Difficult Places, Doing the Most Glorious Work
    Guangdong Selects Excellent Cadres to Strengthen Leadership in Backward Areas

    Guangdong is carrying out a campaign to develop agriculture and grain production in a big way. As part of this, the province is systematically selecting and transferring outstanding cadres from advanced regions to backward regions, strengthening the leadership in these areas at all levels, and helping them catch up with the advanced. According to statistics from the Zhanjiang, Shantou, and Jiangmen special districts, more than 1,500 excellent rural cadres have already been transferred to settle down in areas with poorer natural conditions, more difficult living conditions, and temporarily lower levels of agricultural production, where they have made significant achievements.

    Strengthening the leadership in backward areas to achieve balanced agricultural development throughout the province is an important measure in Guangdong's efforts to develop agriculture and grain production on a large scale. The four western counties of Hepu, Lingshan, Qin, and Dongxing in the Zhanjiang Special District have historically had relatively poor production levels and more difficulties. As early as May and June of this year, the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) selected and transferred seven county party secretaries and thirty-seven commune party committee secretaries from more advanced counties. The Prefectural Committee and the Administrative Office also sent down six deputy commissioners and department heads, and more than 770 cadres to strengthen the leadership at all levels in the four western counties. The Shantou Prefectural Committee selected 578 rural cadres from the counties in the Chaoshan Plain and sent them to the 48 backward brigades of the Meixian County communes and to the key brigades of the communes to serve as deputy party branch secretaries or brigade leaders. The Jiangmen Prefectural Committee also selected a group of cadres to strengthen the work in Defeng County.

    After arriving at their new posts, these cadres all promoted the "four togethers" work style of being hardworking and going deep into the masses. When Cui Liemin, the first secretary of the Shikang Commune Party Committee in Hepu County, was transferred from Dianbai County, he brought a hoe with him. On his first day at the commune, he joined the members of the Taiping Brigade in accumulating fertilizer. Over the past few months, he has insisted on participating in production and leading production, encouraging all commune cadres to go to the fields with hoes and to go to the countryside with work assignment books. Wang Muxiu, the former deputy director of the Meigang Commune in Jieyang County and secretary of the Qipan Brigade Party Branch, became the agricultural secretary of the Bingcun Commune Party Committee in Meixian County. He went deep into the backward Jinpan Brigade and traveled all over the hills and fields within the brigade's boundaries in a few days. He discovered that although the soil here was poor, green manure was abundant. He and the cadres and members worked together to manage a high-yield demonstration plot of several hundred mu of late rice, personally teaching and promoting advanced production techniques such as late rice preparation, transplanting, cultivation, fertilization, and irrigation.

    After arriving in the backward areas, the cadres conscientiously implemented the Party's instructions to grasp production with one hand and people's lives with the other. Li Zhenchang, who was transferred to serve as the party secretary of the Mocun Commune in Defeng County, organized members to eliminate third-class rice seedlings while also running the canteens well, growing vegetables, and raising pigs to improve the lives of the members. He also organized professional teams to go to the mountains to carry out sideline production in a concentrated way, using the income to pay wages and mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses for production. After strengthening leadership in Hepu County, the vast majority of the more than 7,000 canteens solved the problem of vegetable supply and increased the number of pigs and poultry raised. The 556 brigades in the communes of this county generally implemented a policy combining wages and supply systems, and most of them were able to pay wages on a monthly basis.

    Backward areas generally have more difficulties and harder work, but they also have the greatest production potential. The cadres who are determined to help others change their situation are facing difficulties and hardships head on and are determined to take root, blossom, and bear fruit in backward areas. Cadres who have come to the mountainous Meixian County from the Chaoshan Plain not only face various difficulties in working and living conditions, but also face a language barrier, but they are determined to share weal and woe with the masses and build the mountainous areas. Huang Jidi, who became the party branch secretary of the Jiangnan Brigade in the Baitu Commune of Meixian County, found that the members had a strong desire to change the face of the mountainous areas, and there was an inexhaustible supply of green manure in the mountain valleys. He personally went to the mountain valleys with the members to manage more than 60 mu of demonstration plots for transforming mountain pit fields, organized the members to cut green manure in large quantities, and expressed his determination to change the production of mountain pits.

    At present, the double-season late rice is already yellow and drooping, and it will be harvested soon. After this period of effort, these areas with relatively poor natural conditions and temporarily lower levels of grain production will achieve relatively abundant harvests. In the past, Meixian County had a considerable proportion of third-class rice due to the poor rice grown in the mountain pit fields, but this year there has been a more significant improvement. The late rice in Defeng County this year has generally been top-dressed once more, and both the yield per unit area and the total yield will increase compared to last year. The production of the four counties of Hepu, Lingshan, Qin, and Dongxing has also improved significantly compared to previous years.

### 到最艰苦的地方  干最光荣的工作  广东选调优秀干部加强后进地区领导

    到最艰苦的地方  干最光荣的工作
    广东选调优秀干部加强后进地区领导
    新华社广州电　广东各地在大办农业、大办粮食运动中，有组织有计划地从先进地区选调一批优秀干部到后进地区去，逐级加强后进地区的领导力量，帮助后进赶上先进水平。据湛江、汕头、江门三个专区的统计，已经有一千五百多名优秀的农村干部调到自然条件比较差、生活比较艰苦、农业生产水平暂时还比较低的地区去安家落户，并且做出了显著成绩。
    加强对后进地区的领导力量，使全省农业生产平衡地发展，是广东省大办农业、大办粮食的一项重要措施。湛江专区西部的合浦、灵山、钦县、东兴四县，历来生产水平比较差，困难比较多。中共湛江地委早在今年5、6月间，就从比较先进的县抽调了七名县委书记和三十七名各公社党委书记，地委和专署机关还下放了六名副专员、部长和七百七十多名干部，加强西部四县的各级领导力量。汕头地委从潮汕平原各县选调五百七十八名农村干部到梅县各公社的四十八个后进大队和各公社的重点大队担任党总支副书记或正副大队长。江门地委也选调了一批干部加强德封县的工作。
    这些干部到了新的工作岗位后，都发扬艰苦深入的“四同”作风。合浦县石康公社党委第一书记崔烈民从电白县调来时，就随身带着一把锄头，到公社的第一天，便和太平大队的社员们一起积肥。几个月来，他坚持参加生产，领导生产，推动了公社干部个个带锄下田，带工分手册下乡。原揭阳县梅岗公社副社长兼棋盘大队总支书记王木秀到梅县丙村公社担任党委农业书记后，深入后进的金盘大队，几天内就跑遍了大队范围内的山岗和田野。他发现这里土质虽差，绿肥却十分丰富。就和干部社员一起经营了一块几百亩的晚稻丰产示范片，亲自动手传授和推广晚稻备耕、插秧、中耕、追肥、排灌等先进生产技术。
    干部到了后进地区，都认真执行党的一手抓生产，一手抓生活的指示。调到德封县莫村公社担任党委书记的李振昌，一面组织社员消灭三类禾，一面办好食堂，种菜养猪，改善社员生活，并组织专业队上山突击副业生产，将收入所得用来发放工资，调动了群众的生产积极性。合浦县加强领导工作后，七千多个食堂绝大多数解决了吃菜问题，并且增养了生猪和家禽。这个县各公社的五百五十六个大队，一般都贯彻了工资制和供给制相结合的政策，大多数做到了按月发工资。
    后进地区一般困难较多、工作艰苦，但也是生产潜力最大的地区。立志帮助别人改变面貌的干部们，都是迎着困难和艰苦，坚决表示要在后进地区生根、开花、结果。从潮汕平原来到山区梅县工作的干部，不但遇到工作条件和生活条件上的各种困难，而且语言不通，但他们都有决心和群众同甘共苦，建设山区。到山峦重叠的梅县白渡公社江南大队当总支书记的黄基地，发现社员对改变山区面貌的要求十分强烈，山坳里又有取之不尽的绿肥。他就亲自到山坳里同社员一起经营了六十多亩改造山坑田的示范片，组织社员大割绿肥，表示要坚决改变山坑的生产面貌。
    目前，双季晚稻已经黄熟勾头，即将收获。这些自然条件比较差、粮食生产水平暂时比较低的地区，经过这一段时间的努力，将会取得比较丰饶的收获。往年，梅县由于山坑田长的稻子差，三类稻占有相当的比例，今年已有比较显著的好转。德封县今年的晚稻普遍多施了一次追肥，不论单位面积产量和总产量都会比去年增加。合浦、灵山、钦县、东兴四县的生产也比往年有了很大起色。
