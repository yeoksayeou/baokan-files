Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch from Bangkok: The three-day "Military Advisors Conference" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, controlled by the United States, concluded in Bangkok today. This conference specifically plotted a conspiracy to intervene in Laos.

According to a communique issued by the conference, the military chiefs of the eight member states in this aggressive bloc "noted" the situation in Laos and the so-called "Communist threat to South Vietnam." "They discussed the connection of this situation with the treaty area, especially with Thailand." The communique clamored for "the need to maintain constant vigilance in order to take appropriate and timely action when the situation requires."

The communique said that the conference handed over a work program to the "Military Planning Office" of this aggressive bloc, stationed in Bangkok, to continue developing the bloc's existing plans and to consider the decisions that have already been made.

The communique indicated that the next "Military Advisors Conference" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is scheduled to be held in Bangkok in March next year.

These "military advisors" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization also signed a report after the meeting, which contained "recommendations" to the member state governments of this aggressive bloc.

According to the Associated Press, the United States, Thailand, and the Philippines played a decisive role in this conference, and they "set the tone for the conference."

The actual commander of the conference, Felt, commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces in the Pacific, issued a belligerent cry at the opening ceremony of the conference. He arrogantly said, "My Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps will not withdraw from the Western Pacific and the Far East seas." He said that these forces of the United States were "ready to be called upon" to send troops.

The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of Thailand, Nai Thanom, made no secret of Thailand's position of following the United States in interfering in Laos in his opening speech to the conference. He said, "If the alarming events taking place in Laos continue to spread, the armed forces of Thailand will be prepared to do their utmost to take swift action to fulfill the decisions of the Southeast Asia Treaty and Thailand's obligations to this organization."

The Chief of Staff of the Philippine Armed Forces, Major General Cabal, who attended the meeting, clamored before the meeting, "The Laotian crisis is definitely a situation that any member of the Philippines or the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization should be concerned about." He also said at the meeting that the current situation is a "practical test of the strength" of this aggressive bloc.

The United States exerted obvious pressure on this conference. According to Western news agencies, disagreements appeared at the conference. Agence France-Presse reported on the 17th that on this day, "the military advisors of the eight countries did not reach an agreement on the wording of the final communique - especially the part about the Laotian issue," and the participants in the meeting "had differing opinions on how to deal with the Laotian issue."

    东南亚集团军事会议收场
    参加者对策划干涉老挝问题有分歧意见
    费耳特叫嚣美国远东部队准备随时出兵
    新华社18日讯　曼谷消息：美国控制的东南亚条约组织的历时三天的“军事顾问会议”今天在曼谷闭幕。这次会议特别策划了干涉老挝的阴谋。
    据这次会议发表的公报宣称，这个侵略集团八个成员国的军事首脑“注意到”老挝局势和所谓“对南越的共产党威胁”。“他们讨论了这种局势同条约地区、特别是同泰国的牵连关系”。公报叫嚷“需要保持经常的警惕，以便在情况需要时采取适当和及时的行动”。
    公报说，会议交给常驻曼谷的这个侵略集团的“军事计划处”一项工作方案，要它继续发展这个侵略集团已有的计划，并考虑已经作出的决定。
    公报表明这个侵略集团下一次“军事顾问会议”定于明年3月在曼谷举行。
    东南亚条约集团的这些“军事顾问们”在会后还签署了一份报告，其中有向这个侵略集团的成员国政府提出的“建议”。
    据美联社报道，在这次会议上，起决定作用的是美国、泰国和菲律宾，它们“为会议定了调子”。
    会议的实际指挥者、美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特在会议的开幕式上就发出了一片好战的叫嚣。他狂妄地说，“我的海军、陆军、空军和海军陆战队不会从西太平洋和远东海域撤退。”他说，美国的这些部队“准备应召”出兵。
    泰国的副总理兼国防部长乃他侬在向会议致开幕词时，毫不隐讳泰国追随美国干涉老挝的立场。他说，“如果在老挝发生的惊人事件将继续蔓延，泰国的武装部队将准备尽最大的力量，采取迅速的行动，来履行东南亚条约的决定和泰国对这个组织的义务。”
    参加会议的菲律宾武装部队参谋长卡巴尔中将在会前就叫嚷，“老挝危机肯定是菲律宾或者东南亚条约组织的任何成员国应当关心的局势。”他在会上又说什么，目前的局势是对这个侵略集团的“实力的实际考验”。
    美国对这次会议施加了明显的压力。据西方通讯社透露，会议上出现了分歧。法新社17日报道说，这一天，“八国军事顾问没有就最后公报的措词取得一致意见——特别是关于老挝问题的那一部分”，会议的参加者“在处理老挝问题的方法上有分歧意见”。
