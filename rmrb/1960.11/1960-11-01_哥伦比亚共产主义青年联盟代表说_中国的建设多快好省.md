    Communist Youth League of Colombia Representative Says
    China's Construction is Fast, Efficient, and Economical
    Napoleon Ramirez, political secretary of the Atlantic Regional Committee of the Communist Youth League of Colombia, who is visiting China, recently told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the Chinese people, through the Great Leap Forward and socialist construction in a fast, efficient, and economical manner, have fully developed their creativity and enthusiasm, greatly promoting the social productive forces, especially the people's communes, which have played a huge role in increasing agricultural production. This fully proves the correctness of the leadership of the CPC Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
