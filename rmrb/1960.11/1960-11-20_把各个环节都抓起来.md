    Grasping Every Link
    Guo Qiang

    Saving coal and coke is an important measure for increasing steel production. How can we implement this measure to achieve greater results? The experience of Suzhou City in carrying out the "one-dragon" coal-saving competition gives us an important insight: in addition to grasping the two main links of coking and ironmaking, there is great potential in all processes such as transportation, loading and unloading, processing, crushing, and storage. We must grasp them comprehensively, without loosening one link or giving up one step. Things have internal and external connections in the process of development. We complete any task through subjective efforts, correctly or relatively correctly reflecting the internal and external connections of objective things. This is the case with all work, and it is also the case with saving coal and coke. To reduce the consumption of coal and coke, it is necessary to grasp the two main links of coking and ironmaking; however, it is not enough to only grasp these two links, because the potential for saving coal and coke does not only exist in the coking and ironmaking departments. After coal is mined, it needs to go through several passes before being sent to the kiln or furnace. There are also many loopholes in these passes. According to the survey and measurement in Suzhou City, the coal and coke scattered on the carriages, cabins, and dockyards due to careless loading and unloading in the transportation department alone accounts for 1.2% of the transportation volume, and the loss due to rough processing and crushing of coke accounts for about 20%. If these links are not grasped, it is impossible to reduce coal and coke consumption to the minimum. This situation also brings us an important insight into how to calculate the coal and coke consumption of ironmaking, that is, we cannot only calculate the coke ratio into the furnace or the coal ratio into the kiln, but should calculate from the beginning according to the situation of a region or a steel plant. That is, within a certain period of time, how much coal is issued from the coal production area to a certain ironmaking plant or region, how much iron is produced by this plant or region in total, and finally, how much coal is actually consumed per ton of iron. This is the calculation method that is in line with the actual situation.

    Everyone understands that in grasping work, we must distinguish between importance and urgency, and between major and minor. However, grasping the key points is to drive the general, and grasping the major is to better solve the minor. We cannot grasp the major in isolation and ignore the minor. In many cases, timely resolution of minor problems can promote the rapid resolution of major problems. Saving coal and coke is also the same. Hasn't Suzhou had such a situation? The coke ratio into the furnace of some steel plants is not high. One ton of iron only uses 800 or 900 kilograms of coke, but when the total account is calculated, the consumption of raw coal is very high, and one ton of iron is equivalent to three or four tons of raw coal. What is the reason? Obviously, a lot of coal and coke are lost in those "minor" links.

    Where there is coal, there is iron, and where there is iron, there is steel. Saving coal and coke is an important key to increasing steel production. We must carry forward the spirit of the broad masses of workers in Suzhou City of "not losing lump coal, and recovering particles," and comprehensively grasp all links such as transportation, coking, and ironmaking.

    把各个环节都抓起来
    郭强
    节约煤和焦炭是增产钢铁的一项重要措施。怎样贯彻这项措施才能收到更大的成效呢？苏州市开展“一条龙”省煤大竞赛的经验，给了我们一个重要的启示，就是除了抓好炼焦和炼铁两个主要环节以外，运输、装卸、加工、破碎、保管等各道工序，都有很大的潜力，要全面地抓起来，一环不能松，一着不能让。事物在发展过程中有着内部外部各个方面的联系。我们完成任何一项任务，总是通过主观的努力，正确地或比较正确地反映客观事物内外联系的结果。一切工作如此，节约煤和焦炭的工作也是如此。要降低煤和焦炭的消耗，必须抓好炼焦和炼铁这两个主要环节；但是光抓这两个环节还不够，因为节约煤和焦炭的潜力不只是在炼焦和炼铁部门存在。煤炭出矿以后，需要经过好几道关口才送到窑边炉前，在这些关口上漏洞也是不少的。据苏州市的调查测定：仅运输部门由于上下装卸不细而散在车厢、船舱和码头场地上的煤和焦炭就占到运输量的1.2％，由于对焦炭的加工破碎做的较粗糙而损耗的数量就占到20％左右。如果这些环节不抓起来就不可能把煤焦消耗降到最低限度。这个情况也给我们如何计算炼铁的煤焦消耗的方法带来一个重要启示，就是不能够只算入炉的焦比或入窑的煤比，而应该根据一个地区或一个钢铁厂的情况，从头算起。也就是在一定时间内，从煤炭产地给某个炼铁厂或地区总共发出了多少煤、这个厂或地区总共炼出了多少铁，最后得出一吨铁实际消耗了多少煤。这才是符合实际情况计算的方法。
    大家都懂得，抓工作必须分清轻重缓急，分清主要和次要。但是，抓重点是为了带动一般，抓主要的是为了更好地解决次要的，不能够孤立地去抓主要的而忽视次要的。在很多情况下，及时解决了次要的问题，才能促使主要问题得到迅速的解决。节约煤、焦也是这样。苏州不是有过这样的情况吗？有些钢铁厂按入炉的焦比来说并不高，一吨铁只用八、九百公斤的焦炭，可是一算总账，原煤消耗却很高，一吨铁合到三吨或四吨原煤。原因何在？很明显，许多煤、焦是在那些“次要”的环节上损耗掉了。
    有煤就有铁，有铁就有钢。节约煤和焦炭是钢铁增产的重要关键，必须发扬苏州市广大职工们“块煤不丢，颗粒回收”的精神，把运输、炼焦、炼铁等各个环节全面地抓起来。
