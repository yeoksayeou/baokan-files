	Accumulate Water Early for Next Year's Spring Plowing
	The Party committees at all levels in Lezhi County, Sichuan, are making proper arrangements for labor in the current production to focus on water storage and conservation for next year's production. At present, the county's water storage capacity is about 50% higher than in the same period last year.
	Water storage and conservation mainly involve two aspects: First, doing a good job in water storage and conservation in ponds and reservoirs; second, vigorously developing water storage fields based on the principles of sufficient water sources, less labor, no occupation of good land, and convenient water use. In order to effectively carry out water storage and conservation work, the county has assigned water storage tasks to production teams, work groups, and commune members respectively. At present, the average water storage capacity of more than 40,000 mu of water storage fields in the county has reached more than two chi; the average water storage capacity of 200,000 mu of paddy fields has reached more than seven cun.

	Seize the Opportunity Before Freezing to Preserve Soil Moisture
	Hongtai People's Commune in Linxia City, Gansu Province, is seizing the opportunity of abundant rain and soil moisture before the ground freezes, concentrating superior labor and livestock power to re-plow, finely harrow, and level more than 35,000 mu of land to ensure "closed-mouth" moisture retention. According to their experience in previous years, preserving soil moisture before freezing is beneficial for drought resistance and seedling protection.
	In order to speed up the progress of plowing, each team organized experienced farmers to operate the plow and stand on the harrow; livestock were paired according to strength, speed, and size; the land was ranked; and according to the experience of experienced farmers, sunny slopes were plowed early and shady slopes were plowed late when there was frost, and the ground was harrowed on cloudy days and sunny days to avoid the formation of "soil crusts."

	Ensure Safe Overwintering of Green Manure
	In order to strive for high yields of green manure, Moshi Commune in Shimen, Hunan, has adopted measures such as preparing sufficient thermal fertilizers, interplanting tall-stalk crops, improving ditch drainage, erecting windbreak grass mats, and inserting branches to cover and block the wind, to ensure the safe overwintering of green manure, taking into account the early cold characteristics of mountainous areas. At present, the commune has accumulated more than 1.01 million dan of grass ash, cow dung, and fire soil fertilizer, and has applied top dressing once and cleared ditches and drained water twice.

	Study Vegetable Production Techniques
	Liyuan Commune in Zhecheng County, Henan Province, has launched mass scientific research activities on vegetables. In the past six months, it has trained more than 1,000 vegetable technicians who have basically mastered the production and storage techniques of vegetable seedling cultivation, transplanting, fertilization, watering, pest control, and storage, promoting the development of vegetable production.
	Under the guidance of technicians, all 230 mu of cabbage in the commune have achieved reasonable close planting according to local conditions, increasing the density from 1,700 plants per mu to 2,000 plants per mu; and the advanced experience of planting cabbage in ridges and radishes on ridge ridges has been fully promoted. The production teams also organized technicians to adopt the method of observing in the fields and learning from books, effectively preventing and controlling diseases and pests such as cabbage heartworms.

	Winter Hunting Begins in Forest Areas
	More than 10,000 hunters are active in the dense forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains and Wanda Mountains in the Heilongjiang forest area, which has been frozen by ice and snow, to carry out winter hunting activities. The Yichun forest area has already hunted 15,000 pieces of fur and more than 20,000 jin of wild animal meat in half a month.

	Extend the Use Time of Water Power
	In order to ensure the continuation of mechanized grain threshing in winter, Wanjia Management District of Zhujia Commune in Linkou County, Heilongjiang Province, has adopted the method of "dressing and quilting" the irrigation canals to extend the use time of hydraulic power machinery.
	"Dressing and quilting" means adding insulation and cold-proof equipment to the canals to prevent the canal water from freezing. The specific method is: cover the canals above 200 meters with crop straw and tree branches (about 30 cm from the water surface), and add thick soil on top; the covering material should be in contact with the water surface at the end to prevent cold wind from entering and freezing; in places with drops, build a small shed and add heat inside the shed. In this way, normal operation can be ensured under normal freezing weather conditions.

    要闻快报
    为明年春耕早蓄水
    四川乐至县各级党委在当前生产中，妥善安排劳力，为明年生产大抓蓄水保水工作。现在，全县的蓄水量大约比去年同期增长了百分之五十左右。
    蓄水保水主要有两个方面：一、作好塘库的蓄水保水工作；二、根据水源足、花工少、不占好田、用水方便的原则，大搞囤水田。为了切实搞好蓄水保水工作，这个县已把蓄水任务分别落实到生产队、作业组和社员。现在，全县四万多亩囤水田，平均蓄水量已达二市尺以上；二十万亩水田，平均蓄水已达七寸以上。
    抓紧结冻前保好墒
    甘肃临夏市红台人民公社狠抓地冻前雨多墒饱时机，集中优势劳畜力，对三万五千多亩土地进行了复犁、细耱、打耱平整，确保“闭口”墒。他们根据往年经验：在封冻前保好墒，有利于抗旱保苗。
    为了加快犁地进度，各队都组织老农掌犁、站耱；将牲畜按强弱、快慢、大小配对；对土地进行了排队；还根据老农经验，有霜时早犁阳山晚犁阴山，阴天犁晴天耱，避免了地起“板渣”。
    保证绿肥安全越冬
    湖南石门磨市公社为了力争绿肥高产，针对山区早寒的特点，采取了备足热性肥料、间种高秆作物、搞好开沟沥水、架设防风草席、插枝复盖挡风等项措施，保证绿肥安全越冬。目前，公社已积草木灰、牛粪和火土肥共一百零一万多担，已全面追肥一次，清沟沥水两次。
    钻研蔬菜生产技术
    河南柘城县李原公社开展群众性的蔬菜科学研究活动，半年来已培养蔬菜技术员一千多名，他们基本上掌握了蔬菜的育苗、移栽、施肥、浇水、治虫和保管等生产、贮藏技术，推动了蔬菜生产的发展。
    在技术员的指导下，全社二百三十亩白菜都做到了因地制宜合理密植，密度由每亩一千七百棵增加到二千棵；并且全部推广了畦内种白菜、畦埂种萝卜的先进经验。各生产队还组织了技术员采取边田间观察、边学习书本知识的办法，有效地防治了白菜钻心虫等病害。
    林区开始冬季狩猎
    已经冰封雪冻的黑龙江林区，一万多名猎手正活跃在小兴安岭和完 达山密林中展开冬季狩猎活动。伊春林区在半个月内就已经猎取毛皮一万五千张，野生动物肉两万多斤。
      延长水动力使用时间
    为保证冬季机械化脱谷继续进行，黑龙江林口县朱家公社万家管理区采取了给水渠“穿衣盖被”的办法，延长水力动力机械的使用时间。
    “穿衣盖被”就是给水渠增添保温防寒的设备，以防止渠水结冰。具体作法是：在二百米以上的渠道上盖上作物秸棵和树棵子（离水面约三十公分左右），上面加压厚土；在尽头处要使复盖物和水面接触，以防止寒风侵入结冰；在落差的地方，搭成一个小棚子，棚内加温。这样就可以在一般结冰的气候下，保证正常作业。
