Xinhua News Agency, London, 19th - U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Deputy Undersecretary of State Dillon haven't even arrived in Britain yet, and London's "The Times" has already begun to lament Britain's own financial difficulties, expressing its inability to help the United States alleviate its balance of payments crisis.

"The Times" published an article on the 18th entitled "Increased British Overseas Military Expenditure." The article stated that "the U.S. representatives will certainly know that Britain's efforts, especially in terms of foreign investment and other more direct forms of economic aid, are limited by Britain's own many difficulties in balance of payments and the relatively small gold and foreign exchange reserves of the sterling area." The article then enumerated the accounts to the United States one by one and emphasized that Britain's overseas expenditure in the first half of 1960 had already shown a "significant increase" compared to last year. The newspaper made it clear to the United States that demanding more money from Britain was not an option. The article also pointed out that West Germany has gold reserves equivalent to 2.6 billion pounds and a balance of payments surplus of 2 billion U.S. dollars. The implication was very clear.

    英国不愿为美国分担风险
    “泰晤士报”表示要英国多出钱此路不通
    新华社伦敦19日电　美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙还没有到达英国，伦敦“泰晤士报”就已经开始诉说英国自己的财政困难，表示对帮助美国缓和国际收支危机无能为力了。
    “泰晤士报”18日以“英国海外军事开支增加”为题发表一篇文章。文章说，“美国的代表一定会知道，英国的努力，特别是在国外投资和其他更直接的经济援助方式方面，是受到英国本身在支付平衡方面的许多困难和英镑区黄金外汇储备相对地少所限制的”。文章接着把一笔一笔账数给美国听，并且强调说：英国在1960年上半年的海外开支，已经比去年有了“显著的增加”。这家报纸向美国表明，要英国再多出钱此路不通。文章还指出，西德有相当于二十六亿英镑的黄金储备，有二十亿美元的国际收支顺差。言外之意十分明显。
