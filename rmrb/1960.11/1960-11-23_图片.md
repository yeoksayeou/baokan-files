    Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant's workers' spare-time education has closely integrated with production and served production, achieving great results in recent years.
    In order to help veteran workers improve their cultural and technical level, the plant has established a specialized school, supplementing what the veteran workers actually lack. In order to help young workers quickly become familiar with their work, various training classes were organized, and training was conducted through a combination of learning and practice, so that most of the apprentices who entered the factory before 1958 could work independently, and some served as production team leaders. The Liu Huibin team in the Second Workshop has always insisted on learning, and their cultural and technical level has improved rapidly. Now most of the 18 members of the team have entered junior high school classes. They have continuously innovated in production and have been repeatedly rated as the red flag team of the entire plant and Wuhan City.

    武汉重型机床厂的职工业余教育，在厂党委的领导下，紧密结合生产，为生产服务，几年来取得很大成绩。
    这个厂为了帮助老工人提高文化和技术水平，举办了专科学校，根据老工人的实际程度缺啥补啥；为了帮助青工迅速熟悉业务，组织了各种训练班，采取边学习、边操作的办法进行培训，使1958年以前入厂的徒工大多数已能独立工作，有的担任了生产组长。二车间刘惠斌小组始终坚持学习，文化和技术水平提高得很快。现在全组十八人大多数进入了初中班。在生产上他们不断革新，多次被评为全厂和武汉市的红旗小组。图为刘惠斌（左二）正和小组工人研究钻床加工法兰盘。　	沈军摄（新华社稿）
