Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 26th: Students in Sao Paulo, Brazil, held a demonstration yesterday to oppose the visit of twenty-eight U.S. governors.

The U.S. governors are visiting Sao Paulo after visiting Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia. When these American governors went to attend a luncheon held for them by the Sao Paulo business community yesterday, students booed them. The students held up signs with slogans such as: "Cuba is for Cubans!" "We don't want World War III!" "Oppose the Brazilian government's subservience to imperialists!"

That evening, students in Sao Paulo also held a demonstration on the sidewalks of the street where the American governors were staying. They shouted slogans such as "We want Cuba, not Yankees!" and wrote slogans condemning American policies in chalk. Some students were arrested by the police. The arrested students were released after the intervention of Franco, a member of the Brazilian Socialist Party, and a strong protest from the president of the Sao Paulo Student Union.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th: New York News: The *New York Times* in the United States recently published a series of articles revealing the vigorous development of the peasant movement in northeastern Brazil, a region that accounts for one-seventh of Brazil's national territory and one-third of its population. The article stated that "in the vast areas of northeastern Brazil, plagued by poverty and drought, the revolutionary situation is becoming increasingly apparent."

The article revealed that extreme poverty, coupled with the severe droughts of 1951 and 1958, have made the peasants in this region urgently demand to organize and fight for their own liberation. At present, the headquarters of the Peasants' Association has been established in Recife, the main city of the region, and thirty-three branches have been established in the state of Pernambuco, where the city is located, with 20,000 peasant members. The article said that the Peasants' Association had launched a struggle for peasants to transfer a farm called Galileia, with 1,207 acres of land, to the peasants. (Attached photo)

Brazilian students in Sao Paulo held an anti-American demonstration on November 25 to oppose the visit of twenty-eight U.S. governors to Brazil. The picture shows part of the demonstration. The first banner reads "Support Cuba", the second "Get out of Cuba", and the third "Vote for China in the United Nations".

    抗议政府屈从美国　反对美国州长的“访问”
    巴西圣保罗学生举行反美示威
    东北部农民不甘忍受贫困生活纷纷组织起来斗争
    新华社里约热内卢26日电　巴西圣保罗学生昨天举行示威反对美国二十八名州长的访问。
    美国的这些州长在访问里约热内卢和巴西利亚之后正在圣保罗进行访问。当这些美国州长昨天前去参加圣保罗工商界为他们举行的午宴时，学生们对他们报之以嘘声。学生们手里举着标语牌，标语牌上写着：“古巴是古巴人的！”“我们不要第三次世界大战！”“反对巴西政府听命于帝国主义者的做法！”等字句。
    当天晚间，圣保罗学生还在美国州长们居住的旅馆的街道的行人道上举行了示威。他们高呼：“要古巴，不要美国佬”的口号。并用粉笔写了谴责美国政策的标语。有些学生被警察逮捕。在巴西社会党议员弗朗科出面干预和圣保罗学生联合会主席提出强烈抗议之后，被捕的学生才获释。
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：美国《纽约时报》最近连续刊登文章，透露了占巴西全国领土七分之一和拥有全国三分之一人口的巴西东北部这个地区农民运动蓬勃开展的情况。文章说，“在受贫困和旱灾袭击的巴西东北部广大地区，爆发革命的形势愈来愈明显地显示出来了。”
    文章透露：极端的贫困，加上1951年和1958年的严重旱灾的袭击，使这个地区的农民们迫切地要求组织起来，为争取自己的解放而斗争。目前在这个地区的主要城市累西腓已经成立了农民协会总部，并在这个城市所在的伯南布哥州成立了三十三个分会，拥有两万名农民会员。文章说，农民协会曾经发动农民进行斗争，把一个名叫加利列亚的拥有一千二百零七英亩土地的农场移交给了农民。（附图片）
