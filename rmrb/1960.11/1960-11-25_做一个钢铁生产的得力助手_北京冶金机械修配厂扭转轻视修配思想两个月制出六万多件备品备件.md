Xinhua News Agency Report: Beijing Metallurgical Machinery Repair Plant's employees, proceeding from the overall interests, thoroughly reversed the idea of valuing manufacturing and underrating repair work, regarding repair work as their glorious duty. In the past two months alone, they have repaired a large number of equipment for various steel enterprises in the city, and manufactured more than 60,000 spare parts and components of over a thousand varieties, becoming a capable assistant to steel production and winning praise from various production departments.

This factory was formed in October last year by the merger of two small machine processing and repair factories. The relevant departments in Beijing determined that it would specialize in repair and maintenance for steel enterprises. In this transition from manufacturing to repair, many people thought that "doing repair work is not glorious, it's troublesome, and the output value is low," and they were reluctant to hang up the sign of the repair plant. For a long time, they did not concentrate on repair work and often took on outside processing jobs. In response to this situation, the factory's Party organization, under the guidance of the relevant departments at higher levels, launched employees to study documents about being a good "supporting role," organized leading cadres, workers, and technicians to visit steel enterprises, and put forward three questions to organize everyone to have a theoretical debate. First, is the repair factory important? Is it glorious? Second, how to deal with trouble? Third, how should the account of low output value be calculated?

The debate was extremely enthusiastic, and the whole factory, from top to bottom, from management cadres to production workers, expressed their opinions. Lathe operator Sun Shuen said in a group discussion that one day, the small tongue on the clutch of the lathe he was using broke. Because there were no spare parts available, he had to stop the machine and wait for repair, resulting in only 60% of the daily plan being completed that day, which made him very anxious. Many workers said that the loss of one machine tool being down is not too great, but if a steelmaking furnace lacks parts and stops, it will lose dozens or hundreds of tons of steel. Aren't the steel workers anxious? It's really wrong for us not to concentrate on doing repairs for steel plants! Through this discussion, the employees realized that repair and maintenance is an indispensable and important department in production and construction.

During the theoretical debate, the employees also calculated two interesting accounts: The first account was that the rear arm of a crusher in a steel plant in Beijing was broken, and the work of crushing ore had to be replaced by more than eighty laborers by hand. However, the workers of this plant could repair the crusher and put it into production in just over seven workdays. Is it more troublesome to repair in just over seven workdays, or is it more troublesome for eighty laborers to smash ore one by one? The employees further calculated this account: repairing this crusher only requires more than two hundred kilograms of pig iron and more than ten kilograms of copper, while making a new one requires one and a half tons of materials. The workers said that if we take a little more trouble in repair work, we don't know how much manpower and materials we can save for the country. The second account is: the small screws on the cooling water pipe joints of the rolling mill in the Beijing Jianguo Rolling Mill have very low output value, but without them, the cooling water cannot circulate, and the rolling mill will be burned. In this case, the rolling mill will not be able to produce steel. Is it more cost-effective to dislike the low output value and make fewer screws? Or is it more cost-effective to roll out a large amount of steel? Through continuous theoretical debates, presenting facts, and reasoning, the political ideological awareness of the employees throughout the factory has been greatly improved. They have completely reversed the idea of valuing manufacturing and underrating repair work, closely linking repair work with the country's construction cause, and established the idea of wholeheartedly serving steel production.

Due to the improvement of ideological awareness, the whole factory has a completely new look. The factory has reversed the practice of taking on outside work and concentrated all its efforts on serving steel production. If there is not enough equipment, they will manufacture it themselves. They have now manufactured more than 20 units, including gantry planers and vertical lathes. If the factory building is too small, they will build it themselves with the approval of relevant departments, and have built more than 1,000 square meters of simple factory buildings. Now, regardless of wind, rain, or night, as long as steel production units request equipment repair, the workers will go without hesitation. When they encounter urgent work, the workers often work tirelessly, fully demonstrating the noble communist style and selfless labor enthusiasm of the factory's employees.

In order to better serve steel production and truly become a capable assistant to steel enterprises, the employees of this factory have adopted a series of effective measures based on the characteristics of small repair production batches, complex varieties and specifications, unfixed products, and many tasks: First, adjust the labor organization. The factory is divided into two groups, one specializing in the production of fixed-type batches of spare parts and components, and delivering them to various steel plants on a regular basis through contracts. The other is a mobile force, specializing in completing various urgent tasks of equipment repair and spare parts and components manufacturing for enterprises on a temporary basis. Second, when the factory assigns production plans to workshops and teams, it takes the output, quality, variety, specifications, and completion time of spare parts and components as the main indicators. When assigning production tasks, it also specifically explains to the employees the situation of the steel enterprises and the importance of completing the tasks, and mobilizes the employees to go all out to ensure completion. Third, in addition to fixed-type batch products, for various products produced in crash projects, arrangements are made once a day. The leading cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League at all levels of the factory are responsible for specific areas, going deep into the workshops and teams, and grasping everything from production preparation to spare parts delivery, from raw materials, tools, and fixtures to drawings, and checking the completion of the plan three times a day. Fourth, regularly hold joint meetings with production departments, and often send workers, cadres, and technicians to visit the factory, proactively and timely understand the equipment operation of various production units and the specific requirements for repair work, arrange the factory's production and work according to the needs of the production departments, and strive to respond to all requests. At present, in addition to manufacturing urgently needed spare parts and components and equipment repair, this factory is also producing spare parts and components needed by various steel enterprises for next year.

    做一个钢铁生产的得力助手
    北京冶金机械修配厂扭转轻视修配思想两个月制出六万多件备品备件
    新华社讯　北京市冶金机械修配厂职工从全局利益出发，彻底扭转重制造、轻修配的思想，把修配工作作为自己的光荣职责，仅最近两个月就为全市各钢铁企业检修了大量设备，制造了一千多种六万多件备品备件，成为钢铁生产的得力助手，受到各生产部门的赞扬。
    这个工厂是去年10月由两个小型机器加工和修造厂合并成的，北京市的有关部门确定它专门为钢铁企业进行修配。在这一由制造到修配的转变中，不少人认为“搞修配不光荣，麻烦，产值低”，迟迟不想把修配厂的牌子挂出去，在很长的一个时期内不专心搞修配，常常揽外活加工。针对这种情况，这个工厂的党组织，在上级有关部门的指导下，发动职工学习有关当好“配角”的文件，组织领导干部、工人、技术人员到钢铁企业参观访问，并提出三个问题组织大家务虚辩论。第一，修配工厂重要不重要？是不是光荣？第二，怎样对待麻烦？第三，产值低的账应该如何算？
    辩论进行得极为热烈，全厂从上到下，从管理干部到生产工人，都发表意见。车工孙树恩在一次小组讨论中说，有一天，他使用的车床离合器上面的小舌头坏了，因为没有现成的备件，只有停机待修，结果这一天的日计划只完成了60％，急得他团团转。很多工人说，一台床子停下来损失还不大，炼钢炉缺零件一停就要损失几十、几百吨钢，炼钢工人急不急？咱们不安心为钢铁厂搞修配实在不对头！这样一讨论，职工们都认识到修配是生产建设中必不可少的一个重要部门。
    职工在务虚辩论中，还算了两笔有趣的账：第一笔是，北京一个钢厂的一台破碎机后臂坏了，破碎矿石的工作只好由八十多个劳动力用手工代替，而这个厂的工人用七个多工就可以把破碎机修好投入生产。是用七个多工修配麻烦呢？还是八十个劳动力一下一下砸矿石麻烦呢？职工们更进一步算这笔账：修理这台破碎机只需要二百多公斤生铁，十多公斤铜，而做一台新的，则需要一吨半材料。工人们说，咱们搞修配的麻烦一点，不知会为国家节省多少人力和物力。第二笔账是：北京建国轧钢厂轧钢机冷却水管接头上的小罗丝产值很低，但是没有它，冷却水就不能流通，轧钢机就会被烧坏，这样轧钢厂就不能出钢材。是嫌产值低少做罗丝合算？还是轧出大批钢材合算？经过连续务虚辩论，摆事实，讲道理，全厂职工的政治思想觉悟大大提高，彻底扭转了重制造轻修配的思想，把修配工作和国家的建设事业紧密地联系了起来，树立起了全心全意为钢铁生产服务的思想。
    由于思想觉悟的提高，全厂面貌焕然一新，工厂扭转了揽外活的作法，集中一切力量为钢铁生产服务，设备不够用，就自己制造，现已制造了龙门刨、大立车等共二十多台。厂房狭小，经过有关部门批准，就自己进行建设，共修建了简易厂房一千多平方米。现在，不论风雨黑夜，只要钢铁生产单位提出检修设备的要求，工人们就毫不迟疑地前去，遇到紧活，工人们常常废寝忘食地工作，充分显示了全厂职工高尚的共产主义风格和忘我的劳动热情。
    为了更好的为钢铁生产服务，使自己真正成为钢铁企业得心应手的助手，这个工厂的职工根据修配生产批量小、品种规格复杂、产品不固定，任务多等特点，采取了一系列有效措施：一、调整劳动组织，全厂组成两套人马，一套专门生产定型的成批的备品备件，通过合同形式向各钢厂定期交货。另一套是机动力量，专门完成各企业临时性的设备检修和备品备件制造的各项紧急任务。二、工厂给车间小组下达生产计划时，把备品备件的产量、质量、品种规格和完成时间作为主要指标，在下达生产任务时，还向职工具体交代钢铁企业的情况和完成任务的重要意义，动员职工鼓足干劲，切实保证完成。三、除定型成批产品外，对于各项突击生产的产品，每天进行一次安排，全厂党政工团各级领导干部分片包干，深入车间小组，从生产准备到备件出厂，从原材料工卡具到图纸，全面抓，抓到底，并且每天检查三次计划完成情况。四、定期和生产部门举行联席会议，经常派工人、干部、技术人员出厂访问，主动及时地了解各个生产单位设备运转情况和对修配工作的具体要求，根据生产部门的需要安排全厂的生产和工作，力争做到有求必应。目前这个厂除进行当前急需的备品备件制造和设备检修外，正在为各钢铁企业生产明年所需要的备品备件。
