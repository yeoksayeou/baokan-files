Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Nigerian representative and trade unionist, Bassey Onore, spoke at the conference of people from all walks of life in the capital supporting the Congolese and African people's struggle to win and safeguard national independence and oppose imperialist aggression. The full text is as follows: Mr. Chairman, Friends:

With the Chairman's permission, I would like to ask everyone to stand and observe a minute of silence to mourn Mr. Moumié, Chairman of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, who was murdered by imperialism.

In response to the urgent call of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council, we are gathered here today to add our voice to the worldwide chorus of peace-loving people protesting the imperialist trampling of the Congo.

Therefore, on behalf of Mr. Mallam Tanko Yakasai, the head of the Nigerian delegation, our delegation, and myself, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the sponsoring organizations and all the Chinese people for holding this conference to show solidarity and brotherly friendship to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially the Congolese people. The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are waging a resolute struggle against imperialism, led by the United States, the most vicious, barbaric, and inhumane system in human society.

To understand the current situation in the Congo and draw the necessary lessons, let us briefly review the important events that led to the Congo being torn apart by imperialism.

The national struggle in the Congo, under long-term Belgian suppression, finally gained a huge upsurge in the first few months of 1959, with uprisings erupting throughout the Congo. The Belgian colonialists, who had openly boasted of having effective means to engage in colonial suppression and plunder, admitted defeat and decided to adopt the so-called "neo-colonialism" of British imperialism, a new system. They used meaningless grand titles and large amounts of bribes called "salaries" to buy off national leaders, while still making African countries economic appendages to imperialist countries for the purpose of seizing cheap raw materials and dumping products. The Belgian colonialists indeed dramatically declared to the world their willingness to grant the Congo the status of a neo-colony, which imperialism calls "independence."

However, while the Belgians were celebrating their successful "transformation," other imperialist countries, due to the increasing sharpness of internal contradictions caused by the shrinking of their "spheres of influence," were coveting the Congo's rich mineral resources.

At the beginning of this year, when independence negotiations between Belgian colonialists and Congolese leaders were temporarily interrupted, Kasavubu was tricked to Paris by French imperialists, who promised to confer upon this traitor the post of prime minister of a new Central African state formed by merging the so-called Republic of Congo and the Leopoldville province of Congo. Leopoldville province was generally and erroneously considered to be the stronghold of Kasavubu's ABAKO party. However, the ABAKO party's failure in the general election not only exposed the myth of this so-called stronghold, although he had not given up his conspiracy, but they had already been defeated. We must remember that France, along with other imperialists, took the initiative to allow the Kasavubu group free passage through the territory of the Republic of Congo, which they supported, and allowed them unrestricted use of the Brazzaville radio station to slander the legitimate Lumumba government, and are still continuing to interfere in the internal affairs of this young country.

Since this election was arranged by the colonialists, although Lumumba's MNC won the most seats, no party obtained the necessary majority in the election results. This gave the Belgians an excuse to act as guardians of Congolese stability and independence. They attempted to impose an unpopular government headed by Kasavubu on the Congolese people, excluding the two most popular organizations of Prime Minister Lumumba and Deputy Prime Minister Gizenga, in order to embody the stability and independence of the Congo, but they did not succeed. After repeated failures, the colonialists were finally forced to accept a government headed by Prime Minister Lumumba. Prime Minister Lumumba respected certain mediation opinions and decided to organize a national government with Kasavubu as the head of state.

This great victory of the Congolese people's power was welcomed by the Congo and the world, but it was a major setback for imperialism, especially the Belgians. The Belgians saw the hands that they used to exploit being cut off. Since all imperialists are aggressive, the Belgians once again decided to deprive the Congolese people of the fruits they had exchanged with sacrifice. The young Congolese nation, fearing re-conquest, decided to seek assistance from the main imperialist power—U.S. imperialism. Although this request from the Lumumba government was a rare opportunity for U.S. imperialism to expand its rule, it was not worthwhile for the world imperialists' hot war. Therefore, the United States reluctantly refused to assist the Congolese government. Prime Minister Lumumba later, with the consent of the parliament, requested Soviet assistance to resist the threat of Belgian aggression. However, the Soviet Union's swift and clear response to this request exposed the true face of the U.S. ruling clique. The U.S. State Department threatened that if the Soviet Union provided military assistance at the request of the legitimate government of the Congo, the United States would respond with a Korean-style war.

The young Congolese government once again had to listen to the opinions of powerful mediators and decided to seek so-called international protection from the United Nations instead of accepting Soviet assistance. I say "so-called United Nations" because the development of the situation in the Congo, such as the secessionist Tshombe, the treacherous opportunist Kasavubu illegally dismissing Lumumba's legitimate government, the despicable role played by Hammarskjöld, the U.S. State Department refusing to issue visas to representatives of the Congo's only legitimate government to attend the "United Nations" General Assembly, and finally even allowing Kasavubu to enter the United Nations as a representative of the Congo, which caused great humiliation to the African people, all confirm the view that the United Nations is merely a U.S. State Department machine in international clothing.

Secondly, like hypocrites, imperialists are still sculpting statues for "democracy," while they continue to trample on any democratic measures at home and abroad. We do not need to cite the roles played by France in Algeria and Cameroon, or the kind of dictatorship that De Gaulle is currently practicing in France that conforms to the imperialists' interpretation of "democracy." Nor do we need to mention the United States' barbaric racist policies or the United States' current suppression of all democratic forces in the Congo and Latin America. Their world is almost entirely filled with well-known dictatorships. Yet they talk about the "free world."

The Nigerian delegation participating in today's conference wants to remind independent African countries and nationalist movements that those who have cultivated puppet dictatorships throughout Latin America for decades are currently planning to establish a springboard in the Congo to rule the entire Africa.

We must bring to their attention that the United Nations, which we hope can achieve international solidarity, is merely a machine at the disposal of the U.S. State Department. Therefore, it is our responsibility to ask the African people to declare that U.S. imperialism is the greatest enemy of African independence and unity.

Finally, we would like to tell the Congolese people and Prime Minister Lumumba that the current division of the Congo and the failure of the national independence struggle as a result of the sabotage by the United States in collusion with the Kasavubu, Tshombe, and Mobutu groups is only a temporary phenomenon. This is the darkness before the dawn. What has happened in the past and is happening now has confirmed that the logic of imperialism is to make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until its demise. The logic of all revolutions is to struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, until victory. The universality of this theory is very important to the Congolese people and the Asian and African people, because they have realized from the Congo incident that imperialist countries will only make us inseparable from their exploitation and trapped in the clutches of imperialism. The only reliable guarantee for our salvation is to rely on ourselves and our people. Therefore, let us tell all imperialists, headed by the United States, in one voice:

No interference in the Congo!

Down with the traitors Kasavubu, Mobutu, and Tshombe!

Long live Lumumba!

Long live the heroic Congolese people!

Long live Afro-Asian solidarity!

    美帝国主义是非洲的最大敌人
    尼日利亚代表巴肖伦在首都各界支持刚果和非洲人民正义斗争大会上讲话
    新华社28日讯　尼日利亚代表团团员、工会工作者巴肖伦在首都各界人民支持刚果和非洲人民争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义侵略大会上的讲话。全文如下：主席先生，各位朋友：
    我征得主席的同意，请各位起立和我一起默哀一分钟，哀悼被帝国主义谋杀的喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃先生。
    为了响应亚非团结理事会的紧急呼吁，我们今天在这里集会，以便在全世界爱好和平人民抗议帝国主义蹂躏刚果的呼声中，发出我们抗议的呼声。
    因此我代表尼日利亚代表团团长马兰·坦科·亚卡赛，代表我们的代表团和我自己，向各发起团体和全体中国人民为举行这个向亚、非和拉丁美洲人民特别是刚果人民显示团结和兄弟友谊的大会，表示衷心的感谢。亚、非和拉丁美洲人民正在同以美国为首的帝国主义，同人类社会中最凶恶、野蛮和不人道的制度进行坚决的斗争。
    为了了解刚果目前局势并吸取必要的教训，让我们简单地回溯造成刚果被帝国主义所割裂的重要事件。
    刚果的民族斗争在比利时长期镇压之下，终于在1959年最初几个月中获得巨大的高涨，在刚果全国各地都爆发了起义。曾经公开吹嘘具有从事殖民镇压和掠夺的有效手段的比利时殖民主义者，承认了失败，并决定采用英帝国主义的所谓“新殖民主义”这一新制度。它们用毫无意义的大头衔以及大量的称为“薪水”的贿赂来收买民族领袖，而使非洲国家仍旧是帝国主义国家攫取廉价原料和倾销产品的经济上的附庸。比利时殖民主义者的确曾经戏剧性地向世界宣称愿意给刚果以新殖民地的地位，也就是帝国主义所称的“独立”。
    但是，当比利时人正庆祝他们成功的“变革”时，其他帝国主义国家，由于它们“势力范围”的日益缩小而引起了内部矛盾的日益尖锐，并且都垂涎着刚果的丰富矿藏。
    今年年初当比利时殖民主义者和刚果领袖们的独立谈判暂时中断时，卡萨武布被法帝国主义者骗到了巴黎，法帝国主义者曾答应把所谓刚果共和国和刚果利奥波德维尔省合并成的一个新的中非国家的总理职位封给这个叛徒。利奥波德维尔省曾被一般人错误地认为是卡萨武布所领导的阿巴科党的据点。但是，阿巴科党在普选中的失败不仅把这个所谓据点的神话揭破了，虽然他还没有放弃阴谋，但他们已遭到了失败。我们必须记住，法国同其他帝国主义一道主动让卡萨武布集团自由通过他们所撑持的刚果共和国的领土，并允许他们毫无限制地利用布拉柴维尔电台来诽谤合法的卢蒙巴政府，现在仍在继续干涉这个年青国家的内政。
    由于这次选举是殖民主义者所安排的，虽然卢蒙巴的刚果民族运动党获得了最多的席位，但没有一个政党在选举结果中获得了必要的大多数席位，这就使比利时人有了借口来充当刚果稳定和独立的监护人。他们试图把不得人心的以卡萨武布为首的政府强加给刚果人民，而把卢蒙巴总理和基赞加副总理的两个最得人心的组织排除在外，这样来体现刚果的稳定和独立，但并未成功。经过一再失败之后，殖民主义者终于被迫接受以卢蒙巴总理为首的政府。卢蒙巴总理尊重了某些调解的意见，决定组织一个全国政府，而以卡萨武布为国家元首。
    这次刚果人民力量的巨大胜利，受到了刚果和全世界的欢迎，但是对于帝国主义特别是比利时人说来，却是一个很大的失败。比利时人眼看到他们进行剥削的双手被斩断了。由于所有帝国主义富有侵略性，比利时人再一次决定剥夺刚果人民用牺牲换来的果实。刚果这个年青的国家由于害怕重新被征服，决定寻求主要帝国主义——美帝国主义援助。虽然卢蒙巴政府的这个请求对美帝国主义说来是一个扩展统治的难得机会，但是对于世界帝国主义的热战来说，却又不合算，因而美国只好勉强地拒绝援助刚果政府。卢蒙巴总理后来在议会同意下要求苏联援助，以抵抗比利时侵略的威胁。但是苏联迅速明确地响应这个请求，就把美国统治集团的真面目揭露出来了。美国国务院威胁说，如果苏联应刚果合法政府的请求而给予军事援助的话，美国将用朝鲜式的战争来回答。
    年青的刚果政府再一次不得不听从有势力的调解意见，决定寻求所谓联合国的国际保护，而不接受苏联的援助。我说“所谓联合国”，是因为刚果局势的发展，如分裂主义者冲伯，背叛的机会主义者卡萨武布非法解散卢蒙巴的合法政府，哈马舍尔德扮演的卑鄙角色，美国国务院拒发签证给刚果唯一合法政府的代表去参加“联合国”大会，和最后竟让卡萨武布作为刚果的代表进入联合国而使非洲人民蒙受莫大侮辱等等，都证实了联合国只不过是披着国际外衣的美国的这个观点。
    其次，正像伪善者那样，帝国主义者还在为“民主”塑造雕像，而他们在国内外却继续不断地蹂躏任何一点民主措施。我们不必引证法国在阿尔及利亚和喀麦隆所扮演的角色，或是戴高乐目前在法国所实行的符合帝国主义者对“民主”的解释的那种独裁。我们也不必提起美国的野蛮的种族主义政策或美国目前在刚果和拉丁美洲对一切民主力量的镇压。他们的世界里差不多全是尽人皆知的独裁制度。他们却谈论着“自由世界”。
    我们参加今天大会的尼日利亚代表团要提醒非洲的独立国家和民族主义运动注意，数十年来在整个拉丁美洲培植傀儡独裁政权的人，目前正计划在刚果设立跳板来统治整个非洲。
    我们必须提起他们注意，我们所希望能够实现国际团结的联合国仅仅是一台美国国务院御用的机器。所以我们有责任要求非洲人民宣布美帝国主义是非洲独立和团结最大的敌人。
    最后，我们愿意告诉刚果人民和卢蒙巴总理，由于美国勾结卡萨武布、冲伯、蒙博托集团进行破坏的结果，刚果目前陷于分裂而使民族独立斗争遭到失败，这只是暂时的现象。这是曙光即将到来之前的黑暗。过去和现在的发生的事情已经证实帝国主义的逻辑是捣乱、失败、再捣乱、再失败，直到灭亡。一切革命的逻辑是斗争、失败、再斗争、再失败，直到胜利。这理论的普遍性对刚果人民和亚非人民来说是很重要的，因为他们从刚果事件中认识到：帝国主义国家只会使我们离不开他们的剥削而陷入帝国主义的魔掌中。我们获救的唯一可靠保证是依靠我们自己和我们的人民，因此让我们异口同声地告诉以美国为首的一切帝国主义：
    不许干涉刚果！
    打倒卖国贼卡萨武布、蒙博托和冲伯！
    卢蒙巴万岁！
    英雄的刚果人民万岁！
    亚非团结万岁！
