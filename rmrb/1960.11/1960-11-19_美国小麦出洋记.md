    The Story of American Wheat Going Abroad
    Poem by Yi Han, Illustration by Jiang Yousheng
    —According to a U.S. Information Service report: U.S. President Eisenhower once again touted the U.S. "Food for Peace" program on the 13th. He asked the American people to "actively cooperate" with the U.S. government, "while giving thanks for the blessings they have received," by using food to "help" the so-called "people of other countries who are not as fortunate as we (Americans)," so that they can "escape hunger." My home was originally on a farm in Tennessee, but three years ago I was locked up in a granary in New York. Watching millions of compatriots suffer from hunger, the big bosses heartlessly let us idle and go moldy. A few days ago, I suddenly heard a strange thing: the President ordered us to be sent abroad. It is said that American food is to be "used for peace" to save the people of other countries from famine. It turns out that the government is using a large amount of state funds to purchase grain, and the capitalists are happily selling off their stockpiles and making a fortune. Even we feel happy, to avoid rotting in the dark warehouses and being "cremated." (Note) There are also George from the State Department and Hassan from the Central Intelligence Agency, who will also travel with us to see the world. These two officials are especially polite to us, saying that building goodwill depends entirely on our help. The ship owner and the importer are also beaming, because they can load a large number of goods when they return home. There is Asian rubber and African uranium ore, as well as Latin American oil and raw material treasures. To celebrate, we turned on the radio to listen to music happily, but we heard angry voices from all directions:
  “We don’t want the imperialists’ surplus goods, murderous robbers have no compassion.”
      (Note) During economic crises, American monopoly capital often burns large quantities of "surplus" grain to maintain monopoly prices. (Attached picture)

    美国小麦出洋记
    逸寒诗  江有生画
    ——据美新处报道：美国总统艾森豪威尔13日再次鼓吹美国的“粮食用于和平”计划。他要求美国人民“在感谢自己所蒙受的恩惠时”应同美国政府“积极合作”，用粮食“帮助”所谓“不如我们（美国）幸运的其他国家的人民”，使他们“摆脱饥饿”。我的家本住在田纳西的农场，三年前被关进纽约的粮仓。眼看着千百万同胞忍饥挨饿，大老板却忍心让我们闲得发慌。前几天忽听到奇事一桩，总统大人下令要送我们出洋。据说是美国的粮食要“用于和平”，拯救他国人民免于饥荒。原来是政府动用国库大批购粮，资本家销存货发大财喜气洋洋。连我们也觉得满心高兴，免得霉烂在暗仓还挨“火葬”。（注）还有那国务院的乔治和中央情报局的
  哈桑，也要同船随我们出洋观光。这二位官员对我们特别客气，说是广结善缘全靠我们帮忙。船老板和进口商也满脸发光，因为回国时可以把大批货物装。有那亚洲的橡胶和非洲的铀矿，还有拉丁美洲的石油和原料宝藏。为庆贺开收音机听音乐欢畅，却听得愤怒声来自四面八方：
  “我们不要帝国主义者的过剩商品，杀人的强盗不会发慈悲心肠。”
      （注）美国垄断资本在经济危机期间，常将大批“过剩”粮食烧毁，以维持垄断价格。（附图片）
