    Reconnoitering Jinan
    Zhang Shusen
    Before the liberation of Jinan, I was ordered by the Shandong Military Region Headquarters to lead my reconnaissance platoon, in coordination with the 13th Regiment of the Bohai Military Sub-district, to reconnoiter the enemy situation on the western front of Weixian County. One night, the regiment suddenly called me to the regiment headquarters. When I arrived, the regimental commander personally received me and gave me a telegram, saying, "The military headquarters is transferring you to reconnoiter Jinan." When I heard this, I grinned from ear to ear. This was the final battle to liberate my hometown—Shandong! The regimental commander saw my excitement, smiled, and patted me on the shoulder, saying, "The task is indeed glorious, but—" He called me to the table, spread out a military map, and continued, "The task is also very arduous. Look, in the entire Shandong province, the enemy only has two strongholds left: Weixian and Jinan. Weixian will be captured soon, but Jinan is a strong fortress of the enemy, heavily defended. Your task is to obtain detailed information on the enemy's troop deployment, firepower configuration, and so on in Jinan. The military headquarters' idea is for you to capture a prisoner of war of at least regimental commander rank." As he spoke, he carefully looked me up and down and asked, "Can you complete the task?"
    I said excitedly, "Report to the commander, I will resolutely complete the task."
    The regimental commander smiled and said, "Excellent! However, determination is important, but so is carefulness. Go back and discuss it with everyone carefully, and report your action plan to me; if you have any difficulties, raise them, and we will try our best to solve them."
    Back in the platoon, I gathered everyone together and conveyed the task. Hey! It was as if the bed board had suddenly turned into a red-hot iron plate. Everyone jumped up, vying to ask me for tasks. Little Cao grabbed my shoulder and pleaded, "Platoon Leader, you must let me go! You must!"
    "Why must you go?" I asked deliberately.
    "This is the last reconnaissance to liberate Shandong, so of course I must go!" Little Cao said, puffing out his chest, quite reasonably.
    Little Cao's words represented the determination of all the reconnaissance members in our platoon.
    Our plan was as follows: Squad Leader Li Qingzao would lead a group to reconnoiter the situation at the train station; Squad Leader Li Jiatang would lead a group to understand the enemy situation at Qianhua Mountain; and I would lead a group to operate in the city. The meeting point was a stone pavilion on Daming Lake.
    On the morning of our departure, the regimental commander held my hand tightly and said, "The task of reconnoitering Jinan rests on your shoulders. Be bold and careful. I wish you success!"
    The artillery soldiers told us: "If you figure out the enemy's firepower, we guarantee to blind them when the battle starts."
    The commander's instructions and the comrades' hopes encouraged us to move forward bravely. We parted at Luokou Bridge, saying to each other: "I wish you victory."
    Our group of five disguised ourselves as vegetable sellers and came to a shop outside the northeast gate of Jinan. After selling the vegetables, we found a secluded small chicken feather shop to stay for the night. There were many private prostitutes in the shops, specifically catering to Kuomintang officers. We found out that an officer often went to the shop at the bridgehead, so we decided to capture him to provide the military headquarters with some information about the enemy troops in the suburbs of Jinan.
    One evening, after dusk, I wrapped myself in a tattered felt blanket and squatted at the bridgehead, pretending to be a beggar. As soon as the lights came on, that officer led a orderly soldier toward the shop at the bridgehead. When he went upstairs, I quietly walked behind the orderly soldier who was guarding downstairs, waved the felt blanket, wrapped him up, and carried him back. From the orderly soldier's mouth, we learned that the guy was a battalion commander. A while later, Little Cao changed into the orderly soldier's clothes, and the two of us, one after the other, came to that brothel again. Little Cao deliberately took advantage of the guy's flirting with the prostitute and stepped forward and called out, "Battalion Commander!" The guy was just about to get angry when I rushed forward, drew my gun, and took preemptive action: "Well, a dignified national soldier, actually visiting a brothel! Chairman Wang (Yaowu) issued a clear order earlier. How dare you..." The enemy was stunned. He snapped to attention, drooping his head to his chest. Little Cao and I immediately flashed forward, strangled his throat, stuffed his mouth with a towel, stripped off his military uniform, tied him to a long bench, and carried him back to our shop. That night, our liaison officer pushed the prisoner away in a small cart.
    The next day, I took my orderly soldier (Little Cao) and three "coolies" (other reconnaissance members) carrying tobacco, alcohol, fish, and meat, pretending to be giving gifts, and passed through the blockade checkpoint at the city gate. After entering the city, Little Cao and I followed the original plan and came to the entrance of the enemy camp. Little Cao stepped forward and said to the sentry, "Notify your battalion commander that our intelligence team leader has something to discuss with him." At this time, a Kuomintang officer happened to come out from inside. When he heard Little Cao's words, he said to me with a smile, "The battalion commander hasn't returned yet. I'm the deputy battalion commander. It's the same if you tell me anything. Please come in, please!" He walked ahead, and Little Cao and I followed behind, entering the room. When he wasn't prepared, I grabbed a wooden stick and knocked him down. Then I picked up the headset and spoke to the enemy regimental commander: "Report to the regimental commander, the battalion commander, for some reason, beat the deputy battalion commander to death and ran away." As soon as I finished speaking, I heard the enemy regimental commander cursing loudly on the phone: "Damn it, I'll send someone to chase him immediately!"
    After setting up a ruse, we quickly left the enemy's nest. Back at the shop, we changed into civilian clothes and went straight to Daming Lake.
    In the agreed meeting pavilion, I picked a quiet corner to drink tea. In March, Daming Lake was very charming, but I was not in the mood to appreciate it. After noon, Comrade Li Qingzao arrived, disguised as a hawker, constantly shouting, "Cigarettes, fruit candy!" I shouted, "Hey, cigarette seller, come here." He turned to look at me and said, pretending to be surprised, "Oh! It's Manager Zhang! How's business lately?" I replied, "Not so good, just doing some small business." While lighting my cigarette, Li Qingzao whispered to me, "We caught an enemy regimental chief of staff, let's go take a look." I signaled him to go first, and after seeing that no one was watching, I followed him out.
    We snuck out of the train station, dragged the prisoner out from under the railway culvert, and took him to a vegetable garden a mile away to question him. The enemy confessed that Wang Yaowu's direct line troops were defending the north of the city, and heavy weapons were equipped on Qianhua Mountain in the city. There were several thousand civilians working on the mountain building fortifications. He also said that Wang Yaowu said that whether Jinan could be defended mainly depended on Qianhua Mountain. He couldn't figure out any more specific details.
    We decided to capture an even bigger prisoner of war. I asked Li Qingzao's group to take the enemy chief of staff back first, and my group would complete the task of reconnoitering Qianhua Mountain and capturing the big prisoner.
    After returning to the city, we made a more detailed study. Then, carrying weapons, we went to Qianhua Mountain every day. Among the civilians constructing the Qianhua Mountain fortifications, we met the comrades of Li Jiatang's group. I gave them the task of reconnoitering the firepower points, and our group focused on finding the big prisoner of war.
    On the third night after entering the city, we went to a street at the foot of the mountain to "stroll" again. We saw a beautiful car parked in front of the Tongle Theater, and a driver wearing a boat-shaped hat was leisurely humming Peking Opera. I thought, whoever can sit in a car must be a high-ranking enemy officer. If we can get him away, we can definitely get more important information. Moreover, this place is not far from the shop where we live. We can walk through the alleys. After the play is over, it will be late at night. As long as we act fast, it is estimated that there will not be much resistance. There will be no problem after leaving the city. After making up our minds, we divided the work, waiting for the end of the play.
    The pedestrians on the street gradually thinned out, and the streetlights emitted a dim yellow light, illuminating the homeless vagrants huddled in the corners of the walls. The scene was very tragic. Our hearts beat violently with the military vehicles that sped past and the backs of the police who came and went. The night air was very cold, but I was sweating all over. At more than eleven o'clock, the theater ended, and the driver started the engine. In the crowd that surged out, a Kuomintang officer in a wool military coat authoritatively separated the crowd and walked toward the car, followed by two guards. I immediately pulled out my pistol and fired three shots into the sky. The crowd rioted violently, crowded and fled in all directions, scattering the two guards. At this time, Little Cao and the others rushed up, and eight hands grabbed the enemy officer, who was squeezed and tottering, and dragged him into an alley next to the road. I guarded behind with a gun. The prisoner was very dishonest, shouting all the way and squatting on the ground. There was no other way. We had to tie his hands and feet, stuff his mouth, put him on our shoulders, and carry him away.
    After turning many corners, we came to the main street leading to the city gate. We ran as fast as we could. But at this moment, dense gunfire rang out on Qianhua Mountain, and the alarm also sounded. The shrill roar echoed in the city's night sky for a long time, making people's hearts chill. The residents along the road turned off their lights one after another. On the empty street, only a few of us were running like drunkards.
    After turning a street corner, a group of black shadows suddenly jumped out from a large courtyard and kidnapped our people and the prisoner. How could we lose the prisoner we already had in hand? I quickly jumped into the door and saw Little Cao and the others fighting with the enemy for the prisoner. I wanted to shoot, but I was afraid of hurting my own people, and even more afraid of killing the prisoner. In a moment of desperation, I grabbed a bench next to the door and hit the enemy group. With this blow, seven or eight enemies immediately came up with guns to fight me. Although I injured a few of them, I was forced to retreat step by step. Retreating to a horse shed, I saw a guillotine on the ground, so I threw the bench at the enemy's head, raised the guillotine with both hands, and swung it at the enemy. At this time, Little Cao was already injured, his right arm was covered in blood, and he was wrestling with an enemy. I went up and brutally cut off the enemy's arm, and then quickly chopped down three or four more. The enemies screamed and released the prisoner and retreated. Little Cao and the others found a door bar, tied the prisoner's hands and feet to the wooden bar, carried him out of the gate, and I continued to guard them from behind.
    The enemy sent a large force to chase after us, and the shouting grew louder and louder. I told them to carry the prisoner and run fast. I put down the guillotine and used two twenty-shot pistols to fire at the pursuing soldiers. The enemy stopped to fight back, so I got up and ran; when the enemy was about to catch up, I stopped and blocked them again....
    When I retreated to the city gate, Little Cao and the others had not left the city yet. It turned out that the city gate was tightly locked. They were spinning around in a hurry. Someone suggested throwing the prisoner off the city wall, but if he was killed, wouldn't it be a waste of effort? What was even worse was that a few enemies had already come down from the city tower. Fearing that they would snatch the prisoner, I stepped forward, swung the guillotine and chopped at their feet. Three enemies fell on the spot, and the rest were shot dead by the comrades behind. By this time, I was so exhausted that I could no longer lift the knife. The last knife chopped on my own leg. But the pursuers were approaching again, mixed with the neighing of horses. Fortunately, the enemies on the city tower had a misunderstanding, thinking that the ones chasing up were our troops, and shot and stopped the pursuers for a while. I disregarded the bleeding pain of the wound, and used all my strength to raise the knife and chop hard at the iron gate bar. One knife, two knives... With a crash, the lock was finally split open by me. As soon as the city gate opened, two comrades carried the prisoner and ran out of the city quickly.
    Just as Little Cao and I stepped out of the city gate. "Da da da da" A team of cavalry came over and surrounded us. Fortunately, the prisoner was no longer with us at this time, and our mood was not so heavy. We lay behind the tracks to meet the cavalry's attack. Suddenly, Little Cao "Ah" sounded. I crawled over to take a look, and he was no longer in his original position. It was terribly dark, I called out and couldn't touch him. Obviously, he was injured again and rolled into a ditch somewhere. At this time, the enemies rushed over again. I couldn't find him anymore, turned the muzzle and fired violently at the enemies. Before long, our magazines were empty. Just at this critical moment, gunfire suddenly sounded behind the enemies. The comrades who had rushed out had returned to rescue us. Under the pincer attack, the enemy cavalry was opened up a gap, and we took the opportunity to break through the siege and return to the regimental headquarters.
    The prisoner we captured was the guard regiment commander of Wu Huawen. Important military information on Qianhua Mountain was obtained from him. After education by our army, he also worked to win over Wu Huawen's uprising in the subsequent battle to liberate Jinan, which promoted the early liberation of Jinan.
    But our Comrade Little Cao never came back. From that time on, we lost a close comrade-in-arms—an excellent reconnaissance member.
    Glory should be attributed to the heroes who sacrificed themselves for the cause of the liberation of the motherland.

    侦察济南
    张树森
    济南解放前，我奉山东军区司令部的命令，带领我的侦察排，配合渤海军分区十三团，担任侦察潍县西线敌情的任务。一天夜里，团部忽然来电话叫我到团部去一趟。到了那里，团长亲自接见了我，交给我一封电报，说：“军部要调你去侦察济南。”我一听，高兴得咧开大嘴笑。这是解放我的家乡——山东的最后一战呀！团长看出了我的情绪，笑着拍拍我的肩膀，说：“任务确是光荣，不过——”他把我叫到桌子面前，摊开一幅军用地图，接着说：“任务也很艰巨。你看，山东全境，敌人只剩下潍县和济南这两个据点了。潍县指日可破，可是济南是敌人一个坚强的堡垒，有重兵防守。你们的任务，就是把济南敌军的兵力部署、火力配备等情况详细弄到手。军部的意见，是让你们捉个团长以上的舌头回来。”说着，把我细细打量了一番，问我：“可以完成任务吗？”
    我激动地说：“报告首长，坚决完成任务。”
    团长笑了，说：“好极了！不过，决心固然重要，细心也不可缺少。你回去和大家好好研究一下，把你们的行动计划报告我；有什么困难，提出来，我们尽量想办法解决。”
    回到排里，我将大家召集起来把任务一传达，嘿！好像床板突然变成了烧红的铁板似的，大伙一蹦老高，七嘴八舌地抢着向我要任务。小曹扒着我的肩恳求说：“排长，一定得叫我去呀！一定！”
    “为什么一定呢？”我故意问。
      “这是解放山东的最后一次侦察，当然得一定去了！”小曹挺着胸脯，挺有理似地说。
    小曹的话，也就是我们全排侦察员的决心。
    我们的计划是这样的：一班长李清凿带一个组，侦察火车站的情况；二班长李家堂带一个组，了解千花山的敌情；我带一个组，在城里活动。接头的地点是大明湖的一间石亭子上。
    出发的那天早上，团长紧握着我的手说：“侦察济南的任务就担在你们肩上了，要胆大心细。祝你们成功！”
    炮兵战士向我们表示：你们把敌人火力弄清楚了，战斗一发起，我们保证把它打瞎。
    首长的嘱咐，战友们的希望，鼓励着我们勇敢前行。在洛口桥我们分了手，互相道着：祝你胜利。
    我们这组五个人，装成卖菜的来到了济南东北门外的商铺。卖完了菜，晚上就找一家僻静的鸡毛小店住下。商铺有很多私娼，专门接待国民党军官。我们打听到有一个军官常到桥头的那家去，决定捉住他，给军部提供一些济南城郊敌军情报。
    这天黄昏后，我裹着一床破毛毡装成要饭的在桥头蹲着。电灯刚亮，那个军官带着一个传令兵向桥头这家商铺走来了。等他上了楼，我就悄悄踱到在楼下警卫的传令兵背后，一挥毛毡，把他裹住背了回来。从传令兵嘴里打听到，原来那家伙是个营长。一会儿，小曹换上传令兵的衣服，我们俩一先一后，又来到那私娼家里。小曹故意趁那家伙和妓女胡调的时候，上前叫了一声：“营长！”这家伙正要发作，我一步抢上前去，把抢一亮，来了个先发制人：“好啊，堂堂党国军人，居然在逛窑子！王（耀武）主席早明令在先，你好大的胆子……”敌人一下给吓蒙了，一个立正，把脑袋搭拉到胸前，我和小曹立刻闪上去，扼住他的喉咙，用毛巾堵住嘴，剥掉他的军衣，把他捆在一条长凳上，抬回我们住的店里。当天夜里，我们的联络员就用小车把这个舌头推走了。
    第二天，我带着我的传令兵（小曹），和三个挑着烟酒鱼肉的“苦力”（别的几个侦察员）装成送礼的，通过了城门那道封锁哨。入城后，我和小曹按照原订计划来到敌营部门口，小曹上前对岗兵说：“通知你们营长，我们谍报队长有事找他。”这时，正好有个国民党军官从里面出来，他一听小曹的话，满面堆笑地对我说：“营长还没回来。我是营副，有什么事和我说也是一样。里边请、请！”他前面走，我和小曹后面跟，进到屋里，乘他不备时，我抓起一根木棒击倒了他，然后拿起耳机来和敌团长通话：报告团长，营长不知为什么原因，把营副打死后逃跑了。”我刚说完，就听得敌人的团长在电话里大骂：“他妈的，我马上派人去追！”
    布下了疑兵阵之后，我们很快离开了敌巢。回到店里，我们换上了便衣，径直往大明湖走去。
    在约定接头的那间亭子里，我拣了个背静的角落在喝茶。三月的大明湖，景色十分迷人，但我却没有心情欣赏。过了正午，李清凿同志来了，他化装成一个小贩，口里不停地叫着“香烟水果糖！”我喊了一声：“卖烟的，这来。”他回头朝我一看，装得很突然的说：“噢！原来是张老板！近来买卖不错罢？”我回答说：“不怎么好，只做了点小生意。”在给我点火的时候，李清凿小声对我说：“我们捉到敌人的一个团参谋长，去看看吧。”我示意让他先走，看看没有人监视，我接着就跟了出去。
    我们混出了火车站，把舌头从铁路涵洞下拖出来，带到一里外的菜园里去问话。敌人供称：王耀武嫡系部队防守城北，重火器装备在城中千花山上，现有几千民夫在山上修工事。还说王耀武说，济南能否守得住，主要决定于千花山。再具体的情况他弄不清楚。
    我们决定再捉一个更大的舌头。我让李清凿小组先带着敌参谋长回去，由我这个小组去完成侦察千花山，捉大舌头的任务。
    回城后我们又作了细密的研究。然后带着武器每天到千花山附近去转。在构筑千花山工事的民夫中，我们碰到了李家堂小组的同志，我把侦察火力点的任务交给了他们，我们组就一心去寻找大舌头。
    进城后的第三天晚上，我们又到山脚下的一条大街上“散步”，看到在同乐戏院门口，停着一辆漂亮的小轿车，一个带船形帽的司机正悠然自得地哼京戏。我想，能坐轿车的必定是敌高级军官，能把他弄走，一定可以获得更重要的情报。而且这儿离我们住的商铺不远，我们可以从小巷里走，散戏后已夜深，只要动作快，估计不会受多大阻碍。出了城就没有什么问题了。下定了决心，我们就分了工，专等着戏散场。
    街上的行人渐渐稀少起来，路灯发着昏黄的光，照着蜷缩在墙角里的无家可归的流浪儿，景象十分凄惨。我们的心，随着一辆辆急驰而过的军车，随着来来往往的警察的背影剧烈地蹦跳。夜空气很冷，而我的身上却一个劲儿地在冒汗。十一点多钟的时候，戏院散场了，那司机也随着发动了马达。在漫涌出来的人群里，一个穿呢子军大衣的国民党军官神气十足地分开众人向小轿车走来，后面跟着两个卫兵。我立即拔出手枪，朝天放了三响，人群猛烈地骚动起来，拥挤着四散逃奔，一下就把那两个卫兵冲散了。这时小曹他们一拥而上，八只手捉住了被挤得东歪西倒的敌军官，架着闪进了路旁的一个小巷里去，我提着枪在后面掩护。舌头很不老实，一路叫喊着往地下蹲。没办法，我们只得把他的手脚绑起来，堵住嘴，放到肩头上抬着走。
    转了很多弯，来到了通城门的大街上，我们撒开腿使劲地快跑。可就在这时，千花山上响起了密集的枪声，警报也拉响了，那凄厉的吼声，久久地在城市的夜空回旋，听了叫人心里发寒。路旁的居民，一家接一家地都把灯灭了。空荡荡的大街上，只有我们几个人像吃醉了酒似的在奔跑。
    转过一个街角，猛然从一个大院里跳出一群黑影来，把我们的人和舌头一起掳进门里去了。已到手的舌头怎么能丢呢，我赶紧跳进门去，见小曹他们正和敌人争夺舌头。我想开枪，怕伤了自己人，更怕把舌头打死。情急智生，我捞起门旁的一条板凳来直朝敌群打去。这一打，立刻就有七八个敌人端着枪来和我格斗。虽然被我打伤了几个，但我还是被逼得一步步后退。退到一个马棚跟前，我看见地下放着一把铡刀，就把凳子朝敌人头上摔过去，双手举起铡刀，挥舞着朝敌人劈杀过去。这时小曹已经负了伤，右臂全是血，正和一个敌人扭打在一块。我上去狠狠一刀，把敌人的膀子砍断，反手又一连劈倒了三四个。敌人怪叫着，放开舌头后退了。小曹他们找了一根门杠，把舌头的手脚捆到木杠上，抬着冲出了大门，我仍然在后面掩护他们。
    敌人又派了大队人马追来了，吆喝声愈来愈大。我叫他们抬着舌头快跑，我放下铡刀，用两支二十响手枪同时向追兵猛烈射击。敌人停下来还击，我就爬起身跑；敌人快追近了，我又停下来阻击……。
    等我退到城门口的时候，小曹他们还没有出城，原来城门被紧锁了。他们正急得团团转，有人提议把舌头从城墙上摔下去，但如果摔死了，不是白费劲么，更糟糕的是，有几个敌人已从城楼上下来了。我怕他们抢走舌头，一步赶上前去，挥着铡刀砍他们的脚，三个敌人当场倒下去，其余的也被后面同志开枪打死了。这时我已经疲惫得举不起刀来，最后一刀砍在了自己的腿上。可是追兵又逼近了，还夹杂着马的嘶鸣。幸好城楼上的敌人发生误会，以为追上来的是我们的部队，开枪把追兵阻住了一会。我顾不得伤口流血疼痛，用尽全身力量，举刀奋力向铁门杠上砍去。一刀、两刀……哗地一声，大锁终于被我劈开了。城门一开，两个同志抬着舌头飞快地跑出了城。
    我和小曹三人刚出得城门。“哒哒哒哒”一队骑兵横兜过来把我们包围了。好在这时舌头已不在跟前，我们的心情也不那样沉重了。我们卧在路轨背后迎击骑兵的进攻。突然小曹“啊”了一声，我爬过去一看，他已不在原来的位置上。天黑得要命，我叫不应也摸不着他。显然他又负了伤，滚落到沟里什么地方去了。此时敌人又冲了过来，我顾不得再寻找他，转过枪口来向敌人猛烈射击。没有多久，我们的弹夹空了。就在这紧急的时候，突然在敌人背后响起了枪声。冲出去的同志打回来援救我们了。在前后夹击下，敌骑兵被打开了一条口子，我们趁机冲出了重围，回到团部。
    抓来的舌头，是吴化文的警卫团长，从他口中得到了千花山的重要军事情报。经过我军的教育，在后来解放济南的战斗中，他还做了争取了吴化文起义的工作，促使了济南的早日解放。
    可是我们的小曹同志一直没有回来。从那时起，我们失去了一个亲密的战友——出色的侦察员。
    光荣应该归于为祖国解放事业而捐躯的英雄。
