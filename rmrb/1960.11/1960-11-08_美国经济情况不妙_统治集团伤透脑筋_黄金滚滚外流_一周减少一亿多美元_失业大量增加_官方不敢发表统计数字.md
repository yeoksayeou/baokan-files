Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: New York Dispatch: As the US presidential election is about to be held, economic problems that trouble the US ruling group have emerged one after another: rapid decline in gold reserves, increase in unemployment, and continued decline in domestic industrial production.

    According to the US Federal Reserve Bank, in the week ending November 2nd, US gold outflows amounted to 139 million US dollars, thus the total US gold reserves have fallen to 18.334 billion US dollars.

    As of November 2nd, the US has experienced gold outflows worth 1.122 billion US dollars this year. This number exceeds the total gold outflows for the entire last year – 1.0078 billion US dollars.

    According to the "Washington Post" disclosure on the 5th, according to official statistics, the number of unemployed people in the United States increased by another 200,000 in October, reaching 3.6 million. The "Washington Post" also pointed out in its report that the October unemployment statistics had already been completed, but because this number "has obvious political implications," the Republican "government intends to withhold these figures until after the election next Tuesday." The newspaper also pointed out that in past elections, such as the 1956 presidential election and the 1954 and 1958 congressional partial elections, the Eisenhower administration had released favorable statistics early to increase its campaign "capital."

    An article by Gates published in the pre-printed November 7th issue of the American magazine "New Republic" pointed out that according to official statistics, as of August, there were still more than 2.85 million people in the United States in a state of partial unemployment. The article said that the United States is now facing the most serious unemployment problem in fifteen years.

    The article wrote: "It seems we are in a period of persistent and growing unemployment."

    In the past week, the downward trend in US industrial production continued to develop. The operating rate of the steel industry continued to decline, from 54.2% in the previous week to 51.7%. Due to the decline in steel production, the price of scrap steel in Pittsburgh, an important steel industry area, has fallen to its lowest point in six and a half years. The number of unemployed people is also rising rapidly in coal mines affiliated with steel companies.

    The aforementioned "New Republic" magazine article pointed out that in addition to the steel industry, many other basic industries such as crude oil, automobiles, machinery, basic chemicals, etc., currently have at least 35% of their production capacity idle and unable to function. United Press International commented on the recent US economic situation on the 3rd, pointing out that the US industrial production index in October will decline further than in September. The news agency also pointed out that the recent "disappointing situation in US corporate profits has turned into a decline in investment in new factories and equipment."

    美国经济情况不妙
    统治集团伤透脑筋
    黄金滚滚外流　一周减少一亿多美元
    失业大量增加　官方不敢发表统计数字
    新华社6日讯　纽约消息：在美国总统选举即将举行的时候，接二连三地出现了使美国统治集团伤脑筋的经济方面的难题：黄金储备迅速下降、失业人数增加、国内工业生产继续下降。
    据美国联邦储备银行宣布，在截至11月2日为止的一个星期里，美国黄金外流了一亿三千九百万美元，因此美国黄金储备总额已下降到一百八十三亿三千四百万美元。
    到11月2日为止，今年美国已有价值十一亿二千二百万美元的黄金外流。这个数目超过了去年全年黄金外流的总数——十亿零七千八百万美元。
    据“华盛顿邮报”5日透露，根据官方统计，10月份美国全国失业人数又增加了二十万，达到三百六十万。“华盛顿邮报”在报道这一消息时还指出，10月份的失业统计早已作好，但是由于这数字“具有明显的政治含义”，共和党“政府打算扣住这些数字，直到下星期二大选之后才发表”。报纸还指出，在过去几次选举中，如1956年大选和1954、1958年的国会部分改选中，艾森豪威尔政府都是早早就公布对它有利的统计数字来增加它的竞选“资本”的。
    提前出版的11月7日一期的美国“新共和”杂志刊载盖斯的一篇文章中指出，根据官方的统计，到8月份为止，美国全国还有二百八十五万多人处于部分失业状态。文章说，美国现在面临着十五年以来最严重的失业问题。
    文章写道：“看来我们正处在失业的持久和不断增长的时期中。”
    在上星期内美国工业生产的下降趋势继续发展。钢铁工业开工率继续下降，由前一个星期的54.2％降到51.7％。由于钢铁生产下降，在重要的钢铁工业区匹兹堡，废钢的价格已经跌到六年半来的最低点。在钢铁公司附属的煤矿中，失业人数也正在迅速上升。
    上述“新共和”杂志的文章指出，除钢铁工业以外，其他许多基本工业如原油、汽车、机器、基本化学品等，目前至少有35％的生产能力闲置不能发挥作用。合众国际社3日在评论最近美国经济情况时指出，10月份美国工业生产指数会比9月份进一步下降。这家通讯社还指出，最近美国企业利润“令人失望的情况转而使得对新工厂和装备的投资将会下降”。
