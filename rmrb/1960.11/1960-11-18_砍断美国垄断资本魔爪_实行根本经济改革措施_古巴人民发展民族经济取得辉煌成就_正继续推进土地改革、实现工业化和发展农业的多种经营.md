Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: Since the victory of the Cuban Revolution in January 1959, the Cuban people have waged a series of heroic struggles to get rid of the economic enslavement of U.S. imperialism and develop an independent national economy, overcoming U.S. aggression, sabotage, blockade, and restrictions, and achieving brilliant victories.

Before the Cuban Revolution, U.S. monopoly capital controlled the economic lifeline of Cuba. U.S. investment in Cuba totaled approximately $1.2 billion, with these funds controlling key economic sectors such as the sugar industry, oil refining, mining, electricity, finance, and railway transportation. Cuba's foreign trade was mainly dependent on the United States. For example, in 1958, 70% of Cuba's total imports came from the United States, and 67% of its total exports went to the United States. In addition, U.S. capital occupied 110,000 caballerías of the most fertile land, becoming Cuba's largest landowner.

Under the control of U.S. monopoly capital, Cuba formed a distorted economy. It almost exclusively produced one product—sugar—and had only one market—the United States. Apart from sugar production, essential goods such as rice, corn, soybeans, and vegetables could not be self-sufficient. Foodstuffs alone required annual imports of over $100 million from the United States. Not only was the basic industry weak, but many daily consumer goods could not be manufactured. Even toilet paper, pins, ink, and glasses were entirely dependent on imports.

This distorted colonial economy brought profound suffering to the Cuban people. On the one hand, U.S. capitalists, domestic comprador capitalists, and large landowners absorbed the lifeblood of the Cuban people, living extravagant and dissolute lives. On the other hand, the broad masses of the people lived worse than animals. Among the nation's more than six million people, there were 700,000 people who were chronically or semi-unemployed, and more than 100,000 peasant households in the countryside did not even own a single inch of land.

After the victory of the Cuban Revolution, in order to change this semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic structure, the Cuban revolutionary government, regardless of the frantic interference of U.S. imperialism, resolutely carried out a series of economic reforms. To date, the revolutionary government has confiscated approximately 800 million pesos of property from counter-revolutionaries, carried out land reform nationwide, established 200 state-owned farms, 1,000 agricultural production cooperatives, and 2,000 people's stores, taken over and requisitioned all U.S.-owned enterprises and some large private enterprises, monopolized foreign trade, developed economic relations with socialist countries, strengthened market management, and begun urban reform.

At the same time, U.S. monopoly capital, in order to maintain its colonial rule in Cuba, launched a series of frenzied attacks and sabotages against the various economic reform measures of the Cuban revolutionary government. During the Cuban sugarcane harvest earlier this year, 36 million arrobas of sugarcane were destroyed by bombing from planes that took off from the United States (one arroba equals 22.676 jin). Subsequently, the United States successively announced the suspension of all economic aid to Cuba, reduced this year's quota of sugar imports from Cuba by 700,000 tons, and eventually announced an embargo on Cuba. It ordered that, except for a few medicines and foods, the transportation of all U.S. goods to Cuba be prohibited. Moreover, the U.S. authorities attempted to prohibit Morocco, which received U.S. loans, from purchasing sugar from Cuba, and exerted pressure on Canada to join the United States in imposing an embargo on Cuba. The United States vainly attempted to economically strangle the Cuban Revolution through these measures, while conducting large-scale political and military intervention activities.

However, the heroic and unyielding Cuban people were not deterred by the threats of U.S. imperialism. In the tit-for-tat struggle with imperialism, they overcame all kinds of difficulties, defended and developed their own national economy, and received widespread support from the people of the world and socialist countries. Since the beginning of this year, Cuba has established trade relations with socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. According to Cuban Trade Minister Cepero Bonilla's announcement on May 5, due to the expansion of sales markets, Cuba will sell more than six million tons of sugar this year, and its income will increase by 60 million U.S. dollars compared to last year. Among the country's 600 sugarcane production cooperatives, they have already begun planting corn, kidney beans, peanuts, cotton, and developing animal husbandry, and are starting to develop a diversified economy. The number of unemployed people nationwide has been reduced by more than 520,000 in the first year of the revolutionary government's establishment. The minimum wage for workers has increased. In the first quarter of this year alone, the total wage bill for workers nationwide increased by 87.64 million pesos compared to the same period last year.

On the basis of the basic nationalization of enterprises of imperialism and the big bourgeoisie, the Cuban people are confidently entering the second stage of the revolution, striving to continue to advance land reform and implement the nationalization policy, and to achieve industrialization and develop the diversified management of agriculture.

    砍断美国垄断资本魔爪　实行根本经济改革措施
    古巴人民发展民族经济取得辉煌成就
    正继续推进土地改革、实现工业化和发展农业的多种经营
    新华社17日讯　1959年1月古巴革命胜利以来，古巴人民为摆脱美帝国主义的经济奴役和发展独立的民族经济进行了一系列英勇斗争，战胜了美国的侵略、破坏、封锁和限制，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    在古巴革命以前，美国垄断资本控制了古巴的经济命脉。美国在古巴的全部投资约有十二亿美元，这些资本操纵糖业、炼油业、采矿业、电业、金融和铁路交通等经济要害部门。古巴的对外贸易主要是依附美国。例如在1958年，古巴进口总值的70％来自美国，出口总值的67％输往美国。此外，美国资本还占有十一万卡瓦耶里亚的最肥沃的土地，成了古巴最大的庄园主。
    在美国垄断资本的控制下，古巴形成了一种畸形的经济。它差不多只生产一种产品——糖，并且只有一个市场——美国。除了糖的生产外，生活必需品如大米、玉米、大豆、蔬菜等都不能自给，仅粮食和食品，每年就要从美国进口一亿美元以上。不但基础工业薄弱，而且许多日用消费品都不能制造，连手纸、别针、墨水、玻璃杯等都全部依靠进口。
    这种畸形的殖民地经济，给古巴人民带来了深重的苦难。一方面，美国资本家、国内买办资本家和大庄园主吸尽了古巴人民的膏脂，过着奢侈荒淫的生活；另一方面，广大的人民则生活得连牛马都不如，在全国六百多万人口中常年和半失业者有七十万人之多，农村中有十万多农户连一寸土地也没有。
    古巴革命胜利后，为了改变这种半封建半殖民地的经济结构，古巴革命政府不顾美帝国主义的疯狂干涉，毅然地进行了一系列经济改革。到目前为止，革命政府已经没收了反革命分子的财产约八亿比索，在全国范围内进行了土地改革，建立了二百个国营农场，一千个农业生产合作社和二千个人民商店，接管和征用了全部美国资本的企业和部分私人大企业，垄断了对外贸易和发展了同社会主义国家的经济关系，并且加强了市场管理和着手进行城市改革。
    与此同时，美国垄断资本为保持它在古巴的殖民统治，对古巴革命政府的种种经济改革措施进行了一系列疯狂的攻击和破坏。在今年年初古巴甘蔗收获期间，由于从美国起飞的飞机轰炸古巴蔗田，被炸毁的甘蔗就有三千六百万阿罗瓦
  （一阿罗瓦等于二十二点六七六市斤）。接着美国又先后宣布停止对古巴的一切经济援助，削减今年从古巴进口的食糖定额七十万吨直到宣布对古巴实行禁运，它下令除少数药品和食品外，禁止一切美国商品运往古巴。不仅如此，美国当局还企图禁止接受美国贷款的摩洛哥向古巴购买食糖，和向加拿大施加压力，要它和美国一起对古巴实行禁运。美国妄想依靠这些办法，在进行大规模的政治和军事干涉活动的同时，从经济上扼杀古巴革命。
    但是，英勇不屈的古巴人民并没有被美帝国主义的威胁所吓退。他们在与帝国主义展开的针锋相对的斗争中，克服了种种困难，保卫和发展了自己民族的经济，并且得到了全世界人民和社会主义国家的广泛支持。今年以来，古巴和苏联、中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等社会主义国家建立了贸易关系，据古巴贸易部长塞佩罗·博尼利亚5月5日宣布，由于扩大了销售市场，今年古巴将售出的食糖将超过六百万吨、收入将比去年增加六千万美元。在全国六百个甘蔗生产合作社中，已经开始种植玉米、菜豆、花生、棉花和发展畜牧业，着手发展多种经济。全国失业人数，在革命政府成立的第一年中就减少了五十二万多人。职工的最低工资增加了，仅今年第一季度全国职工的工资总额就比去年同期增加了八千七百六十四万比索。
    在帝国主义和大资产阶级的企业已经基本上国有化的基础上，古巴人民正满怀信心地进入革命的第二阶段，为继续推进土地改革和执行国有化政策，为实现工业化和发展农业的多种经营而奋勇前进。
