Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: "From dispersion to concentration, efficiency multiplies," is the new atmosphere commonly appearing in many cities nationwide after unifying the use of freight vehicles owned by government agencies and enterprises.

Currently, about 20% of self-owned freight vehicles of government agencies and enterprises across the country have been organized, allowing these "one household at a time" self-owned freight vehicles to unleash greater potential. Cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, and Fuxin have unified the use of scattered self-owned freight vehicles, increasing the daily output of vehicles by about one time.

The number of freight vehicles owned by government agencies and enterprises nationwide is about half more than that of the transportation departments, but the transportation efficiency is much lower than that of the transportation departments. According to statistics from ten provinces and cities, including Hebei, Liaoning, and Jiangsu, the average annual output per vehicle of freight trucks owned by government agencies and enterprises last year was less than half of that of freight trucks owned by the transportation departments. In order to tap the potential of automobile transportation, these places first strengthened the organization and unified the use of freight vehicles owned by government agencies and enterprises in Shanghai, Beijing, Hebei, and other places during the "one-dragon" transportation grand collaboration competition last autumn. Since the beginning of this year, this practice has been promoted in many large and medium-sized cities due to its significant effectiveness after unified use. According to statistics, more than 80% of the transportation volume completed by freight vehicles owned by government agencies and enterprises in nine provinces and cities, including Hebei and Beijing, last year belonged to external transportation of factories and mines.

More than a year of practice has proven that the shift from decentralized use to centralized use of freight vehicles owned by government agencies and enterprises has many benefits. It facilitates the rational organization of transportation and improves transportation efficiency. After unified use, enterprises and enterprises, departments and departments, regions and regions can adjust between busy and idle times, and rationally adjust vehicle use according to the amount of transportation. It is more conducive to implementing the principle of "guaranteeing key points and taking care of general needs." After the unified use of freight vehicles, since the transportation tasks of government agencies and enterprises are undertaken by the local regional joint transportation company, the transportation departments can arrange more transport capacity to ensure the transportation of key materials. It can also reduce transportation costs, facilitate the comprehensive arrangement of maintenance, improve the integrity rate of vehicles, and facilitate the exchange of technical experience. After the unified use of freight vehicles in many regions, transportation costs have been reduced by about half. The vehicle integrity rate of many fleets in Shanghai, Harbin, and other cities is often around 90%.

Various regions have established regional joint transportation companies to unify the use of freight vehicles owned by government agencies and enterprises, generally adopting three forms. One is to concentrate vehicles according to industry systems to form specialized joint transportation companies. The company's vehicles are uniformly dispatched by the competent authorities of each system, mainly to complete the transportation tasks of the industry, and to support social transportation when capable. For example, after Shanghai formed joint transportation companies according to professional systems such as metallurgy, machinery, and electrical machinery, they were linked up with the transportation departments' fleets transporting similar materials, coordinated to arrange transportation tasks, and effectively guaranteed the transportation of key materials. The second is to concentrate scattered freight vehicles according to regions to form regional joint transportation companies. These vehicles are mostly concentrated from units with fewer vehicles. After centralized operation, the main task is to complete the transportation tasks of the original unit, and then cooperate with the transportation department to complete social transportation tasks when there is spare capacity. The third is that the transportation department and government agencies and enterprises jointly form a joint transportation company to uniformly arrange the transportation tasks in the region. After Fuxin City, Liaoning Province adopted this form, transportation efficiency increased by 1.6 times.

### 统一使用自用货车　运输效率成倍提高  全国百分之二十的机关企业自用货运汽车组织起来  保证重点物资运输，降低运输成本，便于保养维修

    统一使用自用货车　运输效率成倍提高
    全国百分之二十的机关企业自用货运汽车组织起来  保证重点物资运输，降低运输成本，便于保养维修
    新华社22日讯“分散变集中，效率成倍增”，这是全国许多城市统一使用机关企业货运汽车以后普遍出现的新气象。
    目前，全国约有20％左右的机关企业自用货运汽车，已经组织起来，使这些“一家一户”的自用货运汽车发挥了更大的潜力。上海、北京、天津、哈尔滨、阜新等市，把分散的自用货运汽车组织起来统一使用后，车辆日产量大多提高了一倍左右。
    全国机关企业的货运汽车比交通部门的货运汽车多一半左右，但是运输效率比交通部门却低得多。据河北、辽宁、江苏等十省市统计，去年机关企业货车的平均单车年产量，还不到交通部门货车的一半。为了挖掘汽车运输潜力，这些地方在去年秋天开展“一条龙”运输大协作竞赛中，上海、北京、河北等地就首先加强组织统一使用机关企业货运汽车。今年以来，由于统一使用后收效显著，许多大中城市推行了这种作法。据统计，河北、北京等九个省市机关企业货运汽车在去年完成的运输量中，有80％以上是属于厂矿外部运输的。
    一年多以来的实践证明，机关企业货运汽车由分散使用变集中使用，好处多得很。它便于合理组织运输，提高运输效率。统一使用后，企业与企业，部门与部门，地区与地区之间，可以调剂忙闲，根据运量大小合理调剂用车。它更有利于贯彻“保证重点，照顾一般”的方针。货运汽车统一使用后，由于机关企业的运输任务由当地建立的地区联合运输公司担当，交通部门就有可能安排更多的运力保证重点物资的运输。它还可以降低运输成本；便于全面安排保养维修，提高车辆的完好率；便于交流技术经验等。许多地区货运汽车统一使用后，运输成本降低了一半左右，上海、哈尔滨等市许多车队的车辆完好率都经常在90％左右。
    各地建立地区联合运输公司，统一使用机关企业的货运汽车，一般采用三种形式。一种是按行业系统，把车辆集中起来，组成专业性的联合运输公司。公司的车辆由各系统主管部门统一调度，以完成本行业运输任务为主，有能力时则支援社会运输。例如上海市按冶金、机械、电机等专业系统组成联合运输公司后，与交通部门运输同类物资的车队对口挂钩，协同安排运输任务，有力地保证了重点物资的运输。另一种是按地区，把零散的货运汽车集中起来，组成地区性的联合运输公司。这些车辆多是由车辆较少的单位集中起来的。集中经营后，以完成原单位运输任务为主，有余力时再协同交通部门完成社会运输任务。还有一种是交通部门和机关企业共同组成联合运输公司，统一安排所在地区的运输任务。辽宁阜新市采用这种形式后，运输效率提高了一点六倍。
