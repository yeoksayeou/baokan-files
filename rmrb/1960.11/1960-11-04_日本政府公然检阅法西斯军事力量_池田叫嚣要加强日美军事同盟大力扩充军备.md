Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Ikeda government today openly held large-scale military parades throughout the country to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the fascist military force - the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces."

　　Ignoring the provision of the Japanese Constitution prohibiting Japan from possessing an army and any combat force, Hayato Ikeda recklessly declared at the parade in Tokyo: "The Japanese Self-Defense Forces, since their establishment as a police reserve force in 1950, have developed into a military force of 250,000 people."

　　Ikeda openly clamored to maintain a "necessary" Japanese army "on the basis of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." He also clamored that strengthening the U.S.-Japan military alliance "is the key to defending Japan."

　　According to reports, those reviewed in Tokyo included 4,200 soldiers, 120 aircraft, 40 tanks, and many armored vehicles and artillery vehicles. These troops also held a parade in Tokyo.

　　80% of the equipment of the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" is supplied by the United States. The U.S. military advisory group holds real power in the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces."

　　After the Ikeda Cabinet came to power, it actively expanded the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces." Its "Defense Agency" has decided to increase direct military expenditure for the next year to 185 billion yen, which is 36.5 billion yen more than the direct military expenditure for this year decided by the Kishi Nobusuke government, in order to "modernize the equipment" of the Japanese army and establish a so-called "Destroyer" fleet that can be used for joint operations with the U.S. Seventh Fleet.

    池田叫嚣要加强日美军事同盟大力扩充军备
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本池田政府今天公然在全国各地举行大规模的阅兵式，来纪念法西斯军事力量——日本“自卫队”建立十周年。
    不顾日本宪法禁止日本保有军队和任何作战力量的规定，池田勇人在东京的阅兵式上肆无忌惮地宣称：“日本自卫队从1950年作为警察后备队成立以来，已经发展成为有二十五万人的军事力量”。
    池田公开叫嚣要“在日美安全条约的基础上”保持“必要的”日本军队。他还叫嚣，加强日美军事同盟“是保卫日本的关键”。
    据报道，在东京受检阅的有四千二百名士兵、一百二十架飞机、四十辆坦克和许多装甲车和炮车。这些军队在东京市内还举行了游行。
    日本“自卫队”的装备有80％是美国供给的。美国军事顾问团在日本“自卫队”中掌握着实权。
    池田内阁上台后，积极地扩充日本“自卫队”。它的“防卫厅”已经决定把明年度的直接军费增加到一千八百五十亿日元，比岸信介政府决定的今年度的直接军费还多出三百六十五亿日元，以便使日本军队的“装备现代化”，并建立可以用来同美国第七舰队联合作战的所谓“歼灭者”舰队。
