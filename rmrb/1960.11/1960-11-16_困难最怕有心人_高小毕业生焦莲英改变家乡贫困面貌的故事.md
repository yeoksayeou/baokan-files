Difficulties are Most Afraid of Determined People
    ——The Story of Jiao Lianying, a Junior High Graduate, Changing the Poverty-Stricken Face of Her Hometown
    Wang Wenzhou, Wang Taili
    Jiao Lianying, a young female Communist Party member and captain of the Rice Paddy Reform Professional Team of the Second Production Team of Chengguan Commune in Hua County, Henan Province, returned to her hometown to participate in agricultural production after graduating from junior high school in 1957. Under the leadership of the Party, she worked hard with the masses for two years and changed the poverty-stricken face of her hometown.
    The team where Jiao Lianying was located was a well-known poor team in the county. The main reason for the poverty was the bad geology; four-fifths of the team's land was saline-alkali land. In summer, it accumulated foul water and grew weeds, not crops; in winter, it was closed off by ice and snow. The grain harvested throughout the year was not enough for all the team members to eat for three months.
    After the autumn of 1957, the county party committee called for planting rice in the saline-alkali land. In order to gain experience in converting to rice cultivation, the party branch decided to set up a professional team to conduct experiments. At that time, there were fewer male laborers in the village, so fifteen strong young women were selected to form the rice reform professional team, and everyone elected Jiao Lianying as the captain.
    After the beginning of spring, they opened up ten mu of land and planted rice. But when it came time to heading, the rice turned from black to yellow and slowly withered. As a result, even enough rice seeds were not harvested. At this time, some people began to complain, and individual backward masses even clamored for Jiao Lianying to compensate for the seeds, which made Jiao Lianying cry. The branch secretary and most of the masses came to comfort Jiao Lianying, telling her not to be angry. Guo Jiuling, the first secretary of the commune party committee, also came to encourage Jiao Lianying, saying: "Failure is the mother of success. 666 pesticide failed six hundred and sixty-five times in a row, but it succeeded in the end. This is only your first failure, what are you afraid of? To do a career, you must have perseverance!"
    Zhang Xiangli, director of the county party committee office in charge of rice work, also rushed to encourage her. Jiao Lianying's enthusiasm came after hearing these words from the leaders. She said: "I must lead the team members to continue!"
    In order to convert to rice cultivation, the county party committee specially sent Jiao Lianying and Wu Hongcong, a researcher from the County Agricultural Science Research Institute, to Guangzhou and Hubei to visit and learn rice planting techniques. After they visited and studied, they reported to the county party committee. Based on the actual situation, the county party committee decided to expand the area of rice cultivation to two thousand mu. As a result, Jiao Lianying's professional team also expanded to fifty people.
    After the autumn of 1958, the battle to reform the rice paddies began. At the beginning of land reclamation, all the teachers and students of Hua County Normal School also came to participate in their spare time and on Sundays, and the local primary schools also came to support. After more than two months of hard work, two thousand mu of virgin land were opened up.
    Just as rice seedlings were being raised and alkali was being washed away, there was no water to use. Waiting for the newly dug river to release water would take another two and a half months. Jiao Lianying led everyone to dig a water diversion ditch, bringing water from a pit three miles away. But this water was only enough to cultivate half of the seedlings, so it was decided to dig a well here.
    After the rice seedlings were planted, they grew very well. Just as the rice was growing vigorously, it suddenly turned from black to yellow again. At this time, some people said: "The same problem as last year has occurred again, and this time it's all over." Jiao Lianying was more anxious than anyone else. She thought: "This year is different from last year. Last year, there were only ten mu, this year there are two thousand mu. Last year, it only took the effort of fifteen people, this year, everyone is working together. If it fails again, the loss will be even greater!" At night, she looked through "Chinese Rice Cultivation"; during the day, she inspected the rice paddies, making analysis and research. After a few days, she found that the reason why the rice turned yellow was because it had "rice bug." She had seen the treatment method for this kind of insect when she visited and studied in Guangzhou, and it was also in the books. She quickly reported this situation to the party committee and encouraged everyone, saying: "Don't be afraid, there is a way to cure it this year!"
    The main method of treating "rice bug" is to catch it by hand. To catch it by hand, all the labor force must be taken out, and two thousand mu of rice would take a month. This would not only not catch it cleanly, but also affect the rice. At this time, she remembered seeing the method of spraying medicine with cannons in the Henan Science and Technology News. She had never seen what this cannon looked like. Based on her memory, she spent three days and three nights making it with the water pipe of the waterwheel. She bought some pesticides and made some gunpowder to urge the pesticides, and one cannon could kill five or six mu of pests and diseases. In this way, the insects were quickly cured.
    The wasteland of the second team has changed, and two thousand mu of rice is chest-deep. The autumn wind blows, rolling the golden waves of rice. With the breeze, the pungent aroma of rice is sent. This historically stinky smell has been replaced by the pungent aroma of rice. The masses of the second team said: "If it weren't for Lianying, this girl who listens to the Party and has ambition, how could such good rice have grown in this bad land that has never grown crops?" Lianying said: "This is all due to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and everyone's efforts. By myself, I can't do anything." This team has always been a grain-deficient team. Due to the bumper rice harvest, it has jumped to become a surplus grain team. 1960 was a year of continuous great leap forward, and the rice in the second team grew even better than in 1959.
    Because Jiao Lianying led everyone to work hard and practically, she won successive bumper rice harvests. Lianying was selected as a special-class agricultural labor model in Henan Province, became an executive member of the Provincial Women's Federation, and was selected as a "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetter." Last year, she attended the National Women's Socialist Construction Activists Congress and met the beloved leader Chairman Mao. In the same year, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

    困难最怕有心人
    ——高小毕业生焦莲英改变家乡贫困面貌的故事
    王文周　王太礼
    河南省滑县城关公社第二生产队稻田改革专业队队长焦莲英，是一个年轻的女共产党员，1957年高小毕业后回乡参加了农业生产。在党的领导下，她同群众一起，经过二年的艰苦奋斗，改变了家乡的贫困面貌。
    焦莲英所在的这个队，是全县有名的穷队。穷的主要原因是地质坏，全队五分之四的土地是盐碱地。夏天积臭水，长荒草，不长庄稼；冬天冰雪封闭着。全年收的粮食，不够全队社员吃三个月。
    1957年秋后，县委号召把盐碱地改种水稻。为了取得改种水稻的经验，党支部就决定成立一个专业队进行试验。当时，村里的男劳动力较少，就挑选了十五个身强力壮的青年妇女，组成稻改专业队，大家选焦莲英当队长。
    立春以后，她们开了十亩地，水稻也种上了。可是到抽穗时，水稻由黑变黄，慢慢枯萎了。结果，连稻种也没有打够。这时有一部分人便埋怨起来，个别落后群众还嚷嚷着叫焦莲英赔种子，气得焦莲英哭了一场。支部书记和大部分群众来解劝焦莲英，劝她不要生气。公社党委第一书记郭九岭，也来鼓励焦莲英说：“失败是成功之母。666农药一连失败了六百六十五次，结果成功了。你这才是第一次失败，怕什么？干一种事业，必须得有毅力！”
    专管水稻工作的县委办公室主任张相礼，也赶来鼓励她。焦莲英听了领导上这些话，劲头也来了。她说：“我一定要带着队员干下去！”
    为了改种水稻，县委特派焦莲英和县农业科学研究所的研究员吴鸿聪，到广州、湖北去参观学习种稻技术。他们参观学习回来以后，向县委作了汇报。县委根据实际情况，研究决定要扩大改种水稻的面积到两千亩。于是，焦莲英的专业队也扩大到五十人。
    1958年秋后，稻改大战开始了。开垦土地一开始，滑县师范的全体师生在课余时间和星期天，也都赶来参加，当地的小学也来支援。经过两个多月的苦战，两千亩生荒地开出来了。
    正当育秧洗碱时，没有水用。要等新开挖的河放水，还得两个半月。焦莲英带领大家挖了一条引水沟，把三里以外的坑水引来了。但这些水仅够育一半秧苗用，又决定在这里挖土井。
    稻秧插上以后，长得挺好。水稻正长得旺盛，突然又由黑变黄了。这时有些人就说：“又犯了去年的毛病，这一下子又完了。”焦莲英比谁都着急，她想：
  “今年比不得去年。去年只有十亩，今年是两千亩。去年只费了十五个人的力量，今年是大伙齐动手。若要再失败了，损失就更大！”夜间，她翻看着“中国水稻栽培学”；白天，又在稻田地里进行检查，作分析研究工作。几天以后，她发现水稻变黄的原因，是生了“稻包虫”。对于这种虫的治法，她在广州参观学习时，曾看到过，书本上也有。她忙把这一情况向党委作了汇报，并鼓励大家说：“不要害怕，今年有法子治它！”
    治“稻包虫”的办法，主要是用手捉。要用手捉，把全部劳动力拿出来，两千亩水稻也得一个月的时间。这样不但捉不净，而且水稻也要受影响。这时，她想起来在河南科学技术报上看到的用炮喷药的办法。这个炮是个什么样子，也没有见过。她凭着记忆，经过三天三夜的工夫，用水车上的汲水管制成了。买了些农药，又制了些催农药的火药，一炮能杀五、六亩病虫。就这样，很快就把虫治下去了。
    第二队的荒坡变了，两千亩水稻齐胸深。秋风吹来，滚动着金黄的稻浪。随着微风，送来刺鼻的稻米香。这些有史以来的臭腥味，被刺鼻的稻香代替了。第二队的群众说：“要不是莲英这个听党话，有志气的姑娘，这向来没有长过庄稼的坏地，怎么能长出来这样的好水稻呀？”莲英说：“这都是党和毛主席的英明领导和大家的努力。光我一个人，什么也办不成。”这个队一向是个缺粮队，由于水稻丰收，一跃而变成了余粮队。1960年是持续大跃进的一年，第二队的水稻比1959年长的更好。
    由于焦莲英带领大家实干苦干，赢得了水稻连年丰收。莲英被选为河南省的特等农业劳动模范，当了省妇联的执行委员，并被选为“三八红旗手”。去年，她出席了全国妇女社会主义建设积极分子代表大会，见到了敬爱的领袖毛主席。同年，光荣地参加了中国共产党。（附图片）
    为了争取水稻丰收，焦莲英和她的队员们，都非常注意田间管理工作。图为焦莲英（右一）和队员一起，在水稻田里追化肥杨秋焕摄
