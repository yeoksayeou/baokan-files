The Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture, located in the northwest border region of China, has witnessed a leap forward in education alongside the great leap in agricultural and pastoral production. The more than 50,000 Kyrgyz people living on the Pamir Plateau and in the Tian Shan Mountains have seen a rapid transformation of their culturally backward state. Before liberation, the four counties under the autonomous prefecture—Artush, Akto, Akqi, and Wuqia—did not have a single middle school. Now, there are ten secondary schools, including high schools, teacher training schools, and junior high schools, with more than 4,700 students. The number of students in the 63 primary schools throughout the prefecture has increased from over 5,000 before liberation to over 17,800, accounting for more than 90% of school-age children. The number of primary school teachers has also increased from 196 to 793, achieving universal primary education.

Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have attached great importance to the development of cultural and educational undertakings for the Kyrgyz people. To adapt to the characteristics of sparsely populated pastoral areas and the high mobility of animal husbandry production, mobile tent schools have been established. In recent years, with the large-scale development of agriculture in pastoral areas and the trend toward settlement, secondary schools and a large number of fixed primary schools have been built. In 1954, when the autonomous prefecture was established, the autonomous region allocated 130,000 yuan to build a well-equipped teacher training school and middle school in Artush, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, to cultivate a large number of Kyrgyz intellectuals.

The Upper Artush Commune in Artush County, where the Uyghur people live in concentrated communities, has historically been known as the "Cultural Village of the Uyghur People." However, before liberation, only about 1,500 out of the commune's 18,000 people were literate. Currently, the commune has nine schools, including a junior high school, an agricultural middle school, and primary schools, as well as an spare-time junior high school and Red-Expert schools. In 1959, illiteracy was basically eliminated throughout the commune, and it was recognized as an advanced unit in culture and education in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

    帕米尔高原教育事业蓬勃发展
    柯尔克孜族彻底改变文化落后面貌
    本报讯　地处我国西北边疆的克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州，随着农牧业生产的大跃进，教育事业也有了飞跃的发展。生活在帕米尔高原和天山丛中的五万多柯尔克孜族人民，文化落后的面貌已经迅速改变。自治州所属的阿图什、阿克陶、阿合奇、乌恰四个县，在解放前没有一所中学，现在已有高中、师范、初中等中等学校十所，学生有四千七百多人。全州六十三所小学，学生人数由解放前的五千多人发展到一万七千八百多人，占学龄儿童总数的90％以上，小学教员的队伍也由一百九十六名增加到七百九十三名，普及了小学教育。
    解放以来，党和人民政府十分重视发展柯尔克孜族人民的文化教育事业，为了适应牧区地广人稀和畜牧业生产流动性大的特点，还举办流动帐篷小学。最近几年又随着牧区大办农业、走上定居的新情况，兴建起了中学和大批固定的小学。1954年自治州成立，为了大量培养柯尔克孜族知识分子，自治区拨出十三万元，在自治州首府阿图什新建起设备相当完善的师范和中学。
    维吾尔族聚居的阿图什县上阿图什公社，历史上素有“维吾尔族文化之乡”的称号，但在解放前全社一万八千人口中，识字的也不过一千五百人左右。目前这个公社已有初中、农业中学、小学共九所，还有业余初中、红专学校。1959年全社基本上扫除了文盲，被评选为新疆维吾尔自治区文教先进单位。
