The New City of Artush in the Gobi Desert
Liang Mingda, Ping Yi

On the northern foot of the Pamir Plateau, the "roof of the world," lies a town shrouded in greenery: Artush, the capital of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture. Artush is a new town. In the first half of 1952, it was still a Gobi desert dotted with camel thorns. In the second half of that year, the Buaz River flooded, destroying the original location of Artush County, Maihati Bazaar. The Party and the government resettled the affected farmers here, and they became the earliest residents. At the end of that year, the Artush County Party and government leading organs also moved here. Subsequently, more Uyghur farmers and Kirghiz herders moved in, and buildings were constructed. Today, the wide streets are lined with trees, and houses decorated with traditional Kirghiz and Uyghur patterns. The center of the town is a large bazaar (market) that can accommodate tens of thousands of people. The bazaar is surrounded by cinemas, exhibition halls, post and telecommunications bureaus, banks, Xinhua bookstores, and reading rooms. The shops are filled with daily necessities favored by people of all ethnic groups. In the first three quarters of this year alone, goods worth 2.26 million yuan were sold. Every bazaar day, the streets are bustling with activity. During the slack farming season, Kirghiz herders from the Pamir Plateau and the Tianshan Mountains, hundreds of miles away, also come, some of whom ride for days to see their new city. In 1954, the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture was established, and the autonomous prefecture's Party and government leading organs were located here, making it the political, economic, and cultural center of the Kirghiz people. More than 3,000 mu of wasteland have been newly opened up in the suburbs, and many newly cultivated orchards are supplying the market with a large number of figs, grapes, and various fruits. The annual output of figs alone is 150 tons.

With the continuous growth of the city, industry and cultural and educational undertakings have also developed vigorously. Now, there are well-equipped normal schools and middle schools, as well as secondary agricultural technical schools and meteorological and health personnel training classes, which annually send various construction talents to the vast agricultural and pastoral areas of the autonomous prefecture. In the past, the Kirghiz people had few intellectuals, but now a new generation of intellectuals is growing up in large numbers under the cultivation of the Party. (Attached picture)

    戈壁新城阿图什
    梁鸣达　平一
    在世界屋脊帕米尔高原北麓，有一座绿荫笼罩的城镇，这就是克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州首府阿图什。阿图什是一座新兴的城镇。1952年上半年，这里还是一片生长着骆驼刺的戈壁滩。当年下半年，布阿孜河洪水暴发，冲毁了原阿图什县所在地麦下提巴扎，党和政府将受灾的农户安置在这里，他们就是这里最早的居民。那年底，阿图什县党政领导机关也搬到这里来了。接着，迁来了更多维吾尔族农民和柯尔克孜族牧民，一幢幢房屋修建起来了。如今，在宽阔的大街两旁，绿树成荫，布满了雕有柯尔克孜和维吾尔族传统图案的房屋。市镇中心是一个能容纳数万人的大巴扎（集市）。大巴扎四周耸立着电影院、展览馆、邮电局、银行、新华书店和阅览室。商店里摆满了各族人民喜爱的日用百货，仅今年前三个季度，就出售价值达二百二十六万元的各种商品。每逢巴扎天，街上熙熙攘攘，农闲时还有来自数百里以外帕米尔高原和天山丛中的柯尔克孜族牧民，其中有些是特意骑几天马来看看自己的新城市的。1954年克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州成立，自治州党政领导机关就设在这里，成为柯尔克孜族政治、经济、文化的中心。城郊新开的荒地已达三千多亩，许多新辟的果园，已供应给市场大量无花果、葡萄和各种水果，仅无花果即年产一百五十吨。
    随着城市的不断成长，工业和文化教育事业也蓬勃地发展起来了。现在，这里已有设备完善的师范和中学，还有中级农业技术学校和气象、卫生人员训练班，每年为自治州广大农牧区输送各种建设人材。以前柯尔克孜族没有什么知识分子，现在新的一代知识分子，正在党的培养下大批成长起来。（附图片）
