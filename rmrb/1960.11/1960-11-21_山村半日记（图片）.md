A Half-Day in a Mountain Village
    Han Yu

Gaolipu Brigade of Xiaoyingzi Commune in Qinglong County, Hebei Province, used to be a poor mountain village. Since the Great Leap Forward, under the leadership of the Party, the commune members have waged a struggle against nature with soaring enthusiasm. After two years of hard work, they have turned all the mountain slopes into large terraced fields and made them into raised beds, realizing the gardenization of mountain land, so that mountainous areas can also achieve high yields, and barren land can also produce more grain.
	
I. An Amazing Transformation

    Looking up from the foot of the mountain, one sees only high mountains and steep ridges.
    But when you reach the top of the mountain and look down, it turns into large green wheat fields.
    
II. Water Flows Uphill

    The Party Branch Secretary said: "This year we are suffering from a drought, but our wheat is guaranteed a bumper harvest!"
    
III. A Small Mountain Spring

    The Party Branch Secretary said: "These flowing waters must be counted as our income!" I was puzzled, and he said with a smile, "You'll understand when you turn the hillside."
    It turned out that they had used this spring to build a water-powered processing plant. In the past, fifteen people and fifteen animals processed 800 catties of grain every day, but now it only takes three people to operate and can process 5,000 catties every day. This is indeed a significant income.
    
IV. Returning from Pasture

    The sun is setting. The pigs and sheep are not driven back to the village, but up to the mountain. Because the pens are built on the terraced fields, this can save a lot of labor and time transporting fertilizer.
    
V. Busily Working Everywhere
    Some are busy with the autumn harvest, some are busy with the "small autumn harvest," and some are busy with autumn plowing and burning fertilizer... busily preparing for next year's bumper harvest.

    山村半日记
    韩羽
    河北青龙县肖营子公社高力铺大队，过去是个贫困的山村。大跃进以来，社员们在党的领导下，以冲天干劲向自然展开了斗争，经过两年来的努力，就把所有的山坡地全部修成了大片大片的梯田，并做成畦田，实现了山地园田化，使得山区也能搞丰产，薄地也能多打粮。	一、奇异的变化
    从山下仰望，看到的只是高山峻岭，
    可是走到山顶往下一看，却变成大片绿油油的麦田了。	二、水往高处流
    支部书记说：“今年闹旱灾，可是我们的小麦却保证了大丰收！”	三、一股小山泉
    支部书记说：“这些流过的水，都要算成我们的收入哩！”我正纳闷，他笑着说：“转过山坡你就明白了。”
    原来他们就利用这股泉水建了一座水力加工厂。过去十五个人和十五头牲口，每天加工粮食八百斤，现在只需三个人操作，每天就能加工五千斤。这确是一笔很大的收入。	四、牧归
    太阳落山了。猪、羊并不是赶回村里，而是赶到山上去。因为场圈盖在梯田上，这样可以节约不少运肥的劳力和时间。	五、处处忙有的人忙着秋收，有的人忙着“小秋收”，有的人在秋翻、烧肥……，忙着准备明年的大丰收了。
