The Tortured Olaya　　　Peru　Gamilo Blas
This is a famous work by the contemporary Peruvian painter Gamilo Blas. "The Tortured Olaya" depicts the indomitable spirit of the heroic Peruvian people. José Olaya was a poor fisherman. One night, he carried letters from Peruvian revolutionaries to Lima. He swam five kilometers in the water from under a bridge, but was unfortunately captured by Spanish colonialists on the way. We can see from the picture: ferocious executioners are torturing him, forcing him to betray his comrades, but the heroic Olaya would rather die than yield. He was shot by Spanish colonialists at the execution ground in Lima. This execution ground is today known to everyone as "Olaya Execution Ground," named after a national hero of the Republican era.

    受刑的奥拉亚　　　秘鲁　加米罗·勃拉斯
    这是秘鲁的当代画家加米罗·勃拉斯的一幅有名的作品。“受刑的奥拉亚”表现了英雄的秘鲁人民的坚强不屈。何塞·奥拉亚是一穷渔夫。他在一个夜晚带着秘鲁革命者的信件到利马去。他从桥洞出发在水里泅行了五公里，不幸在中途被西班牙的殖民主义者俘虏了。我们从画面上可以看到：凶恶的刽子手们正在拷打着他，逼他供出他的同志们来，但是英勇的奥拉亚宁死不屈，他被西班牙殖民主义者枪杀在利马的刑场上。这个刑场就是今天大家所熟悉的、取名于共和国时期民族英雄的《奥拉亚刑场》。
