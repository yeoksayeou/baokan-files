From the Editor

    A Member of the Commune
    After fitter Gao Changhua arrived in the countryside, because he cared about production, cared about the collective, loved agriculture, and loved labor, he was repeatedly praised by the brigade branch secretary. Gao Changhua said, "I am a member of the commune, and there is still much work to be done in the future!"
    "I am a member of the commune"—what a wealth of meaning is contained in this simple and cordial sentence! A member of the commune has the responsibility of a member of the commune. Having transitioned from a third-grade fitter to a member of the commune, the responsibility is even greater. By positioning oneself correctly and understanding one's responsibilities, one naturally feels that the work one has done is not too much but too little for the entire rural construction undertaking. This inspires one to always maintain a humble attitude and continuously advance in the great rural construction cause.
    Currently, many people are going to the agricultural front lines. We believe that all those who go to work in the communes, whether for a long term or a short term, regardless of what type of work they did in the past or what kind of leader they were, if they want to make a contribution in the countryside, they should regard themselves as a member of the commune, just like Gao Changhua.

### 公社一员

    公社一员
    钳工郜长华到了农村以后，因为关心生产、关心集体，热爱农业、热爱劳动，受到大队支部书记多次表扬，郜长华说，“我是公社的一员，今后需要做的工作还多得很呢！”
    “我是公社的一员”这句简朴而亲切的话是包含着多么丰富的意思啊！公社的一员有公社一员的责任，从三级钳工转为公社一员，责任就更加重大。摆好了自己的位置，弄清了自己的责任，很自然地感到现在所做到的一点工作对于整个农村建设事业说来，不是太多而是太少了。这就激励自己永远保持谦虚的态度，在伟大的农村建设事业中不断前进。
    现在有不少的人要到农业第一线去，我们认为，凡是下到公社工作的人，不论是长期或是短期，也不论过去干什么工种或是什么长，要想在农村作出一点贡献，都应当像郜长华那样把自己当做公社的一员。
