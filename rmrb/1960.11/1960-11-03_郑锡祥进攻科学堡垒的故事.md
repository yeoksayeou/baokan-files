    For the Cause of the Proletariat, Forward!
    Two years ago, one summer morning, in a workshop of the Liming Machinery Factory, just after the production meeting, Chief Foreman Zheng Xixiang was about to leave the work section when Party Branch Secretary Zhang Zhenming hurriedly stopped him: "Master Zheng, didn't you want to go to school? This time it's your turn to go to university!" This sudden news stunned Zheng Xixiang. He looked at the smiling face of the branch secretary, half-believing, half-doubting, and asked, "Secretary, are you kidding? Look at me, this rough guy, can I still go to university?"
    Under the care of the Party, Zheng Xixiang stepped into the threshold of Liming Machinery Factory's amateur university. However, difficulties, like giant waves in the sea, crashed down one after another. He listened to the teacher lecturing on analytic geometry, on curves and coordinates, and it was like a blind man feeling an elephant; when the teacher lectured on the element symbols and chemical equations in chemistry class, he couldn't understand it either. Every time he received a homework book returned from the teacher with a "2" score, he couldn't help but feel panicked and blushed, thinking, "How can I be worthy of the Party!" One day, he couldn't hold back any longer. After work, he found the Party Branch Secretary and said, "Secretary, studying at university is harder than anything else. I think I should return this university student sign and just work hard." The Party Branch Secretary smiled when he heard his words and said, "Old Zheng, according to you, isn't studying at university for the sake of working hard? The working class must strive to become stronger and must not be discouraged. You are an old worker. Today, workers studying at university is for the sake of our entire working class!"
    Zheng Xixiang's father was a textile worker in Shanghai. When he was nine years old, his father contracted consumption and died in poverty. At the age of fourteen, he, a helpless orphan, entered a textile machinery factory in Shanghai as a child laborer. He fetched water, swept the floor, and couldn't get any rest. He worked hard all day long, unable to even feed himself. Under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, he experienced the baptism of one great strike after another... Thinking of these things, and then thinking of what the branch secretary had said, Zheng Xixiang constantly asked himself: At that time, the workers fought bravely against the enemy, who had water cannons and machine guns, with their bare hands. What was it for? Today, with our own regime, with a life that is many times better than before liberation, the Party asks me to seize the science fortress for the sake of the entire class, for the sake of the victory of communism. Can I retreat? Thinking of these things, an endless power immediately arose in him. He was determined: For the cause of the proletariat, attack the science fortress!

        Diligent Study and Hard Practice
    Before entering university, he had only studied for five years, on and off. After entering university, others understood after listening to the teacher once, but he didn't understand after four or five times. To facilitate studying and going to work, he moved his luggage to the school's collective dormitory. At night, he often reviewed his lessons until late at night. When studying the electricity part of physics class, the teacher talked about the generation of electricity. This "electricity," which cannot be seen with the naked eye, stumped him. After listening to a class, his mind was full of questions. After class, he sat alone in the classroom thinking. During evening self-study, he looked up the reference books, turning the pages one by one. Whenever he dozed off, he ran to the washroom, turned on the faucet, and splashed water on his head, persisting until he understood the problem.
    It was with this spirit of getting to the bottom of things that Zheng Xixiang constantly cleared away various obstacles on the road forward, and at the same time, he paid attention to constantly learning from the good learning experiences of others, thus quickly catching up with the group. By the last semester of university, his academic performance had jumped to third place among the sixty-odd graduates.

    Being the Master of Machines
    Graduation design began, and Zheng Xixiang and ten other students took on an important task of designing an automatic optical grinder. This news spread like a spring thunder in the valley, immediately causing different reactions from people. Some people said that Zheng Xixiang and his team were great, and some said that they were daring. Some even expressed their doubts in front of them, saying, "Don't think too highly, just modify other people's designs."
    The entire structure of this design had thousands of parts. When used to process precision mechanical products, the accuracy error could not exceed one-fourteenth of a hair. Zheng Xixiang, who was in charge of the overall design, ignored the gossip. Seeing the urgent needs of production, he was determined to design it.
 But how to design it? He had thought of many things: Designing a hand-operated one? He was afraid that the workers would be too tired. Designing a mechanical transmission? The speed would be too fast, the inertia would be too great, and it would be difficult for workers to master, and it would be easy to produce defective products. Finally, he was enlightened by a passage from the teacher's physics class and proposed a new plan for everyone to study, and everyone thought it was feasible. However, they couldn't find any existing information.
    Relying on their own production experience, relying on the scientific theories they had learned, and relying on their own class brothers, they researched day and night, visited veteran workers, and held forums with workers, and finally designed it. In order to allow workers to work happily and comfortably, they changed the original standing operation to sitting operation, and the whole machine was like a desk.
    The next day, the group was going to discuss the design's finalization. Zheng Xixiang couldn't sleep all night. Were there any places that were not suitable for production? Were there any places that would affect the workers' health? He got up again and repeatedly checked each part of the design, and the next day he put forward the suggestions for modification. After more than a month of hard work, the design was finally successful and was applied to production.
    Once theoretical knowledge is grasped in the hands of the workers, they will exert great power. Zheng Xixiang worked in the workshop. In the past, he was too busy to take care of himself, but now he can think of various ways to solve the key problems in production. Others said that dead things would become alive in his hands.

    郑锡祥进攻科学堡垒的故事
    新华社记者  莫镐群  姚桂兰
    为了阶级的事业，前进！
    两年前一个夏天的早晨，在黎明机械厂的一个车间，生产会议刚刚开完，总工长郑锡祥刚想抬脚回工段，党支部书记张振明赶忙叫住他：“郑师傅，你不是想上学么？这回可该你上大学了！”这一个突如其来的消息，一下子把郑锡祥给楞住了。他看看支部书记微笑着的脸，半信半疑地问道：“支书，你是开玩笑吧，你看我这个粗人还能上大学么？”
    郑锡祥在党的关怀下，跨进了黎明机械厂业余大学的门槛。但是，困难却像大海中的巨浪扑面打来，一个跟着一个。他听老师讲解析几何，讲曲线、坐标，简直像丈二金刚摸不着头脑；老师讲化学课的元素符号、化学方程，他也听不懂。他每次接到从老师发回来的打着“二”分的作业本，不由得心发慌，脸发红，心想：“我这怎么对得起党啊！”一天，他实在憋不住了，在劳动下班以后找到党支部书记说：“支书，读大学比干什么都难，我看还是把这大学生牌牌退了，好好劳动吧。”党支部书记听了他的话，不由得笑起来说：“老郑呀，照你的说法，念大学不是为了好好劳动么？工人阶级得发愤图强，千万不能泄气呀。你是个老工人，今天工人念大学是为了我们整个工人阶级的事业！”
    郑锡祥的父亲是上海一个纺织工人，他九岁那年，父亲得了痨症，在贫病交迫中死去。十四岁那年，他这个无依无靠的孤儿，进了上海一家纺织机械厂当了童工。他在工厂打水、扫地，得不到休息。整天劳累，维持不了个人温饱。在国民党反动统治下，他经历了一次又一次大罢工的战斗洗礼……。郑锡祥想到这些，再想想支部书记的话，心里不断自问自答：那时工人在拥有水龙、机关枪的敌人面前，和敌人进行赤手空拳的英勇搏斗，为的是什么？今天，有了自己的政权，有了比解放前不知好了多少倍的生活，党叫自己去夺取科学堡垒，为的是整个阶级事业，为的是共产主义胜利，我能后退吗？他想到这些，立时产生一种无穷力量，他下定决心：为了阶级事业，向科学堡垒进攻！
        勤　学　苦　练
    他进大学前，前前后后不过念了五年书。上大学后，学习中别人听老师讲一遍就懂，他四遍五遍不懂，他为了学习和到厂上班方便，把行李搬到学校的集体宿舍住下来。晚上，他常常复习功课到深夜。在学物理课电学部分时，老师讲到电的产生，这个肉眼看不到的“电”可把他难住了，听了一堂课之后，一脑子的问题。下课后，一个人坐在教室里思考，晚上自习时又把参考书找来，一页一页翻下去，每当打瞌睡时，就跑到盥洗室扭开水龙头，哗啦啦往头上浇它一阵，一直坚持到把问题弄通为止。
    郑锡祥就是这样以打破砂锅问到底的苦学精神，不断扫清前进道路上的各种障碍，同时又注意不断学习别人的好的学习经验，因而迅速赶上队伍。到大学的最后一学期，他的学习成绩一跃而为六十多名毕业生中的第三名。
    做　机　器　的　主　人
    开始毕业设计了，郑锡祥和另外十个学员担当一项重要的自动光学磨床的设计任务。这消息一传出，就像在山谷劈下了一阵春雷，马上引起人们的不同反应。有的人说，郑锡祥他们是好样的，有的说他们胆大包天。有的甚至当着他们的面表示怀疑，说不要想得太高吧，只要把人家的设计改改就行了。
    这次设计的全部结构共有上千个零件，用它加工精密机械产品，精度差误要求不能超过一根头发的十四分之一。担任总体设计工作的郑锡祥不管那些风言风语，看到生产上的急迫需要，决心把它设计出来。
  可是怎样设计呢？他自己曾设想过许多：设计手摇的吧，怕工人干活太累，设计机械传动的吧，转速太快，惯力太大，工人不好掌握，易出废品。最后他想到教师讲物理课的一段话，开了窍，提出一个新方案和大家研究，大家都认为可以。可是找来找去都找不到现成的资料。
    他们依靠自己的生产经验，依靠学来的科学理论，依靠自己的阶级弟兄，日日夜夜地研究，登门拜访老工人，找工人座谈，终于设计出来了。为了让工人能愉快舒适地劳动，他们把原来是站着操作的改为坐着操作，整台机器就像办公桌一样。
    第二天小组就要讨论设计的定型了，晚上郑锡祥翻来复去地睡不着。是不是有哪些地方对生产不适合？有哪些地方会影响工人健康？他又爬起身来按着设计的每个部件挨个地反复检查，第二天又把需要修改的意见提出来。经过一个多月的艰苦劳动，设计终于成功了，并被应用到生产中去。
    理论知识一旦掌握在工人的手里，他们就会发挥出巨大的力量。郑锡祥在车间里劳动，过去是自顾不暇，现在他能想出各种各样办法来解决生产中的关键问题。别人说，死东西到他手里也会变成活的了。
