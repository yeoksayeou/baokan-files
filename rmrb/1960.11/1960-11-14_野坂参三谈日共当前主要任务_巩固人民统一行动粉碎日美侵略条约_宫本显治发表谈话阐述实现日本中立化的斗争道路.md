    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 11th: The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" today published an interview with Nozaka Sanzō, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. In the interview, Nozaka called on the Japanese people to continue their struggle against the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with even greater determination than in the past and to prevent all specific activities to implement this aggressive military treaty.

    Nozaka discussed the struggle of the Japanese people and their future tasks.

    He said that the large-scale movement of the Japanese people has indeed achieved great results in recent months. They prevented Eisenhower's visit to Japan, overthrew the Kishi Nobusuke government, and then forced the Ikeda government to dissolve the Diet and announce elections. He said, "The decisive reason for these achievements is that the Japanese people deeply understand the reactionary essence of the Japan-U.S. military treaty, understand that U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capitalists closely linked to U.S. interests are the number one enemies of the Japanese people, and understand that the future and destiny of our people and peace depend on the victory of the struggle against the Japan-U.S. (Security) Treaty."

    He continued that the fraternal sympathy expressed by the people of China, Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Southeast Asian countries that have suffered from Japanese imperialism, as well as the people of other continents, has given the Japanese people great encouragement.

    Nozaka then described the development, strengthening, and continuous enhancement of people's unity in postwar Japan.

    He pointed out that in various postwar struggles, the Japanese Communist Party timely recognized the huge potential force in various social activities, guided the movements of people from different social strata with different worldviews, but who unanimously demanded peace and democracy, towards a consistent direction, and organized their struggles. This social unity gradually formed a major political force and continuously achieved victories in united action. Nozaka said: All victorious struggles have proven that the success of the movement depends on the participation of the most revolutionary force of the working class - the Communists.

    Referring to the reasons for the development of the Japanese Communist Party, Nozaka said: In recent years, the Communists have steadfastly devoted themselves to enhancing the party's influence among the masses in the struggle to win people's united action, and this work has achieved great success. The correct policies pursued by the Communist Party in recent years have provided mature conditions for expanding the party's ranks. The Party Central Committee made appropriate resolutions based on this situation. As a result of implementing this resolution, the number of party members has increased rapidly. The number of party members nationwide is now twice what it was in August 1959.

    Nozaka pointed out that continuing to consolidate the people's united action is the most important task of the Japanese Communist Party at present. The purpose of united action is first and foremost to crush the Japan-U.S. aggression treaty. We believe that it is our task to build this united action into a strong united front. This united front will be used to achieve goals that are even greater than in the past.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Miyamoto Kenji emphasized in a statement published in "Akahata" that as long as the broad forces opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" continue to carry out common struggle, and at the same time unite with all peace-loving forces and anti-imperialist forces in the world, Japan's neutralization can be achieved.

    Miyamoto continuously published statements on the 12th and 13th in "Akahata" regarding the issue of Japan's neutralization, which is currently being fiercely debated by progressive forces and conservative forces in the election struggle.

    Miyamoto pointed out that a policy of neutrality means that Japan does not participate in any military alliances, and therefore, of course, it is also necessary to abolish the military alliance with the United States. He also said that Japan's adoption of a neutral policy is fully in line with the Japanese Constitution. He accused the Japanese government of violating the Constitution by concluding a new "Security Treaty" with the United States.

    Miyamoto pointed out that Japan's neutralization is important for the safety of the Japanese people and Asian peace, because at present, the imperialist camp headed by the United States still adheres to the policy of "strength" and the "Cold War" policy, obstructing peaceful coexistence.

    Miyamoto emphasized that more and more Japanese people are currently demanding to get rid of the military alliance concluded with the United States and demanding Japan's neutralization.

    Miyamoto then refuted the fallacy of the Ikeda government's vigorous promotion of the so-called economic "destruction" of Japan after neutralization. He said that only neutralization can bring bright prospects to the Japanese economy. He said that after Japan's neutralization, it will not only be able to cancel military expenditures and increase expenditures for stabilizing people's livelihoods, but also be able to change the unequal trade between Japan and the United States and expand Japan's equal and mutually beneficial trade with the Soviet Union, China, and countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    Miyamoto strongly condemned the Ikeda government's blatant slander of neutrality as a "fantasy" and accused the Democratic Socialist Party of shielding the Liberal Democratic Party in opposing Japan's neutralization. He said that this shows that the Democratic Socialist Party in fact agrees with the Japan-U.S. military alliance.

    Miyamoto emphasized that in the current international situation, no matter how the U.S.-Japan ruling class plots conspiracies, slanders, and oppresses the Japanese people, the final victory belongs to the Japanese people who are fighting for peace, independence, and neutrality.

    野坂参三谈日共当前主要任务
    巩固人民统一行动粉碎日美侵略条约
    宫本显治发表谈话阐述实现日本中立化的斗争道路
    据新华社布达佩斯11日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”今天刊登了日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三对这家报纸发表的谈话。野坂在谈话中号召日本人民今后应以比过去更大的决心继续反对日美“安全条约”的斗争，制止一切执行这一侵略性的军事条约的具体活动。
    野坂论述了日本人民的斗争和今后的任务。
    他说，日本人民大规模的运动在最近几个月来确实取得了巨大的成绩。他们阻止了艾森豪威尔对日本的访问，推翻了岸信介政府，接着又迫使池田政府解散国会，宣布举行选举。他说，“获得这些成就的决定性原因是，日本人民深深懂得日美军事条约的反动本质，懂得美帝国主义以及同美国利益密切联系的日本垄断资本家是日本人民的头号敌人，懂得我国人民的未来，今后的命运与和平取决于反对日美（安全）条约的斗争的胜利。”
    他接着说，中国、朝鲜、印度尼西亚、越南和深受日本帝国主义灾难的东南亚各国人民以及其他各洲人民所表示的兄弟般的同情，给日本人民以很大的鼓舞。
    野坂接着叙述了战后日本人民力量发展、壮大和人民团结不断增强的情况。
    他指出：在战后的各种斗争中，日本共产党及时地认识到潜在于各种社会活动中的巨大力量，把各种不同社会阶层的具有不同世界观的、但一致要求和平和民主的人们的运动导向一致的方向，并组织了他们的斗争。这一社会团结逐步形成为重大的政治力量，并且在统一行动中不断地取得了胜利。野坂说：一切赢得胜利的斗争都证明，运动的成功决定于工人阶级最革命的部队——共产党人的参加。
    谈到日共发展的原因，野坂说：共产党人在最近几年内在争取人民统一行动的斗争中坚定不移地致力于增强党在群众中的影响，这一工作取得了极大的胜利。共产党最近几年内所进行的正确政策已经提供了扩大党的队伍的成熟条件。党中央根据这种情况作出了适当的决议。执行这个决议的结果是，党员人数迅速增加。现在全国党员人数相当于1959年8月的两倍。
    野坂指出：继续巩固人民统一行动是日本共产党当前最主要的任务。统一行动的目的首先是粉碎日美侵略条约。我们认为，把这一统一行动建成为坚强的统一战线，是我们的任务。这个统一战线将用于实现比过去更远大的目标。
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治在“赤旗报”发表的谈话强调指出，只要反对日美“安全条约”的广泛力量继续进行共同斗争，同时与世界上一切爱好和平的力量和反对帝国主义的力量团结起来，就能够实现日本的中立化。
    宫本就目前进步力量同保守势力在竞选斗争中激烈争辩的日本中立化问题连续在12日和13日的“赤旗报”上发表谈话。
    宫本指出，中立政策意味着日本不参加任何军事同盟，因此当然也要取消同美国的军事同盟。他还说，日本采取中立政策是完全符合日本宪法的。他指责日本政府违反宪法，同美国缔结新“安全条约”。
    宫本指出，日本中立化对于日本人民的安全和亚洲和平有重要作用，因为在目前，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营仍然坚持“实力地位”政策和“冷战”政策，阻挠和平共处。
    宫本强调指出，目前越来越多的日本人民要求摆脱同美国缔结的军事同盟，要求日本中立化。
    宫本接着驳斥了池田政府大肆宣传的所谓中立化后日本经济“将会遭到‘破坏’的谬论”。他说，只有中立化才能给日本经济带来光明的前景。他说，日本中立化后不仅能够取消军事开支，增加安定民生的费用而且能够改变日美间的不平等贸易，扩大日本同苏联、中国和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国间的平等互利贸易。
    宫本强烈谴责池田政府公然诬蔑中立为“幻想”，并且指责民主社会党庇护自由民主党反对日本中立化。他说，这表明民主社会党事实上是赞同日美军事同盟的。
    宫本强调指出，在目前的国际形势下，尽管美日统治阶级怎样策划阴谋诡计，诽谤和压迫日本人民，最后胜利是属于正在为争取和平、独立、中立而斗争的日本人民的。
