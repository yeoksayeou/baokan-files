　　To Turn Lake Tianzhou Land into Granaries
　　Counties Bordering Poyang Lake Form Reclamation Army to Reclaim Land and Rush Planting
　　(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 12th) A reclamation army of 140,000 people from counties bordering Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province has launched a large-scale campaign to reclaim Lake Tianzhou land and rush planting. Currently, more than 220,000 mu have been reclaimed, of which more than 120,000 mu have been planted with crops such as wheat, barley, and rapeseed.
　　Vigorously developing the Lake Tianzhou land bordering Poyang Lake is an extremely important measure for Jiangxi Province to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Poyang Lake borders hundreds of miles, with moderate rainfall and fertile soil. According to preliminary surveys, approximately more than 3 million mu of land can be reclaimed. Last winter and spring, the people of various counties in the lake area have successively reclaimed 470,000 mu of Lake Tianzhou land and planted them all with grain and oil crops, obtaining very good harvests.
　　In order to strive to harvest a season of grain and oil crops before the arrival of the spring flood, various localities have fully utilized the immense strength of the people's communes, concentrating a large amount of manpower and materials, and adopting the methods of reclaiming high-lying areas first, then low-lying areas, reclaiming first and then enclosing, and reclaiming and planting simultaneously, to carry out shock reclamation and rush planting. In the Jiujiang Special Zone, the county-level secretaries in the lake area took command, with 1,700 cadres going deep into the front lines of reclamation, leading more than 50,000 laborers, and deploying a large number of tractors and plowing cattle to reclaim and plant simultaneously. Currently, the entire area has reclaimed more than 116,000 mu of Lake Tianzhou land, of which 60,000 mu have been rushed to plant grain and oil crops.
　　While vigorously grasping shock reclamation and rush planting, combined with the governance plan of Poyang Lake, embankments are being built in a planned way for reclamation and cultivation, gradually changing the Lake Tianzhou land from being able to only rush plant a season of crops during the receding water period to ensuring planting and harvest year-round. This is a new development in the development and utilization of Poyang Lake this year. In the reclamation areas, through overall planning, new drainage and irrigation systems have also been universally established, so as to both drain waterlogged areas and irrigate, ensuring planting and harvest in all seasons.
　　In the reclamation and rush planting, various localities have paid special attention to the quality of cultivation and management work to ensure that the various crops planted are well planted, well managed, and high-yielding. Many areas have put forward the slogan "Turn wasteland into mature land." Under the conditions of drought resistance and reclamation, they have adopted deep digging and multiple plowing methods, achieving appropriate deep plowing, careful cultivation, and fine harrowing. The seeds sown have also been selected and dried in a timely manner. At the same time, various localities are managing while rush planting. In view of the characteristics of Lake Tianzhou land being far from villages and easily harmed by birds and animals, field management professional teams have been universally established, building sheds and stationed in the fields to strengthen field management.

### 要湖田洲地变粮仓  鄱阳湖滨各县组成开荒大军垦荒抢种

    要湖田洲地变粮仓
    鄱阳湖滨各县组成开荒大军垦荒抢种
    本报南昌12日电　江西省鄱阳湖滨各县十四万垦荒大军，展开了大规模的开垦湖田洲地的抢种运动。目前，已垦荒二十二万多亩，其中十二万多亩已种上了大、小麦、油菜等作物。
    大力开发鄱阳湖滨的湖田洲地，是江西省大办农业、大办粮食的一项极其重要的措施。鄱阳湖滨，纵横数百里，雨水调和，土质肥沃，据初步勘测，约有三百余万亩土地可以开垦。去冬今春，滨湖地区各县人民已先后开垦了四十七万亩湖田洲地，并全部种上了粮油作物，获得了很好的收成。
    为了力争在春汛到来湖水上涨前收获一季粮油作物，各地充分运用人民公社的巨大力量，集中了大批人力、物力，采取先垦高处，后垦低处，先开垦后围堤，边垦边种的办法，突击开垦抢种。九江专区滨湖各县，三级书记挂帅，一千七百多名干部深入垦荒第一线，带领五万多劳力，出动大批拖拉机和耕牛，做到边垦边种。现在，全区已开垦湖田洲地十一万六千多亩，其中有六万亩抢种上了粮油作物。
    在大抓突击开垦抢种的同时，结合鄱阳湖的治理规划，有计划地进行围堤垦殖，逐步变湖田洲地只能在退水期抢种一季作物为常年保种保收，这是今年开发利用鄱阳湖的一个新发展。各地在围垦区内，通过全面规划，还普遍建立了新的排灌系统，做到既能排除渍水又能灌溉，四季保种保收。
    在垦荒抢种中，各地特别重视耕作质量和管理工作，以保证抢种的各种作物种好、管好，高产多收。许多地区提出“荒地赶熟地”的口号，在抗旱开荒的条件下，采取深挖、套犁的办法，做到了适当深耕，精耕细耙。播种的种子也都及时进行了选晒。同时，各地边抢种边管理，针对湖田洲地离村庄远、易受鸟兽危害的特点，普遍建立了田间管理专业队，搭棚驻田头，加强田间管理。
