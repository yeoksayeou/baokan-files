Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st -- Vientiane dispatch: At the invitation of Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Premier Phouma of the Kingdom of Laos paid a three-day visit to Sam Neua city on the 18th and returned to Vientiane at noon on the 20th.

According to a broadcast by Radio Vientiane today, Premier Phouma held talks with Prince Souphanouvong in a very cordial and mutually understanding atmosphere during his visit to Sam Neua city.

When Premier Phouma left Sam Neua city, thousands of people from all walks of life in Sam Neua city and leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front saw him off at the airport.

According to a broadcast by the Radio of the Laotian Combat Forces, when Premier Phouma arrived at Sam Neua city airport on the 18th, he was warmly welcomed by Prince Souphanouvong, leaders of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, the Sam Neua Provincial Committee, Tao Ma, the acting governor of Sam Neua Province, and thousands of people from all levels and ethnicities in Sam Neua city, as well as garrison troops.

Amidst the cheers of thousands of people, Princes Phouma and Souphanouvong warmly embraced each other.

Prince Souphanouvong delivered a speech first, expressing a warm welcome to Premier Phouma's visit to Sam Neua city. He said that the U.S. imperialists and their lackey, the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group, are plotting to attack Vientiane and subvert the legitimate Phouma government. Premier Phouma's visit this time is of great significance to the fate of the motherland. This meeting will create favorable conditions for the negotiations between the Royal Government and the Lao Patriotic Front to achieve results, promote greater consolidation of national unity, and further thwart the new conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous group.

Prince Souphanouvong also said that the Lao Patriotic Front has consistently supported the Phouma government's policy of realizing peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

Premier Phouma then delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude to Prince Souphanouvong, the Lao Patriotic Front, and the people of Sam Neua for their warm reception. He expressed his desire for the motherland to embark on a truly peaceful and neutral path. He called on the people to unite and support the Royal Government in following the above path.

On the afternoon of the 18th, the people of Sam Neua city held a blessing ceremony for Premier Phouma.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 21st -- The Radio of the Laotian Combat Forces published a commentary today, pointing out that the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group, is stepping up preparations to establish a puppet government in order to realize its conspiracy to turn Laos into a colony and military base of U.S. imperialism.

The commentary revealed that when the Phoumi group established the "Revolutionary Committee," it began drafting a pseudo-constitution, bribing some members of parliament, and preparing to use the form of a pseudo-national assembly to legitimize their puppet government; and preparing to attack Vientiane again, using Thai reactionaries to carry out provocative activities, attempting to create chaos within the patriotic and peace-loving forces, and placing the Royal Government in a difficult and unstable situation.

The commentary further pointed out that the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group is putting pressure on the King, attempting to force the King to recognize the puppet government they have established.

The commentary emphasized that the people of Laos clearly believe that the Phouma government is the only legitimate government of Laos, and this government has been given the trust of the National Assembly and the King in accordance with the provisions of the Lao Constitution. In particular, the Phouma government's policy of peace and neutrality has received the full support of the people of the country and also the support of peace-loving people around the world. The commentary pointed out that the actions of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group to establish a puppet government are a serious and blatant violation of the law and a trampling of the King's power.

The commentary said that the struggle and solidarity spirit of the Lao people have reached a climax. All forces united by the "Committee for Peace and Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unification" have severely hit the enemy's conspiracies. The commentary pointed out that the Lao people will never tolerate the emergence of a puppet government.

    评论揭露说，富米集团在成立“革命委员会”时，就着手起草伪宪法，收买一部分议员，准备利用伪国会的形式来使他们的傀儡政府合法化；并准备再一次进攻万象，利用泰国反动派进行挑衅活动，企图制造爱国爱和平力量内部的混乱，使王国政府处于困难、不稳定的境地。
