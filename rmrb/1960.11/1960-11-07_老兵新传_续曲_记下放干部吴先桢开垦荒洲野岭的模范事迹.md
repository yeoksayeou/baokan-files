    Sequel to "A New Story of an Old Soldier"
    ——A Record of the Model Deeds of Cadre Wu Xianzhen, Sent Down to Reclaim Barren洲 and Uncultivated Ridges
    Li Xiuquan, Yuan Guanliang

Those who have seen the film "A New Story of an Old Soldier" are deeply moved by the noble quality of the protagonist, Old Zhan—"planting trees for future generations to enjoy the shade." What is recorded here is a person like Old Zhan. His name is Wu Xianzhen, a cadre of the De'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province, who was sent down to the countryside. In recent years, he has continuously fought on barren洲 and uncultivated ridges. Whenever he successfully transformed a barren洲 and uncultivated ridge into a "land of rice and grain," he unhesitatingly accepted another new task from the Party and rushed to another new battle post. The people of De'an County eagerly spread Wu Xianzhen's heroic deeds, calling him a "Communist Party member in the style of Old Zhan."

Wu Xianzhen was originally the Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the De'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In the winter of 1957, the Provincial Party Committee called on cadres to go up to the mountains and down to the countryside to build the rural areas. Wu Xianzhen wrote four applications in succession, expressing his determination "to take the countryside as his home and land reclamation as his career." Based on his determination and the need to establish a well-run state-owned reclamation farm, the County Party Committee approved his transfer to serve as the First Secretary of the Communist Youth League Reclamation Farm Party Committee.

One cold winter day, Wu Xianzhen, carrying simple luggage, led a group of cadres who were sent down and some educated youth, braving the chilly north wind, embarked on a journey and arrived at "Jin Lake," which had been undeveloped for thousands of years. Here, the weeds were taller than people. At that time, one educated youth, seeing such desolate wilderness, shook his head and sighed: "This broken situation makes it so difficult to build a new countryside!"

    "It is difficult, but we are Communists, with the ability to create the world. Difficulties are most afraid of people with confidence and perseverance. We should not only see today's difficulties, but also think of the bright tomorrow. Think about it, isn't our happy life today created by revolutionary predecessors overcoming thousands of difficulties?" In this difficult and arduous situation, Wu Xianzhen never relaxed his political and ideological education of young comrades.

When they first arrived, because there were not many houses, dozens of people slept in one room at night. Wu Xianzhen and the other three comrades of the Party Committee used a few bamboo poles and some grass to build a shed that was open on all sides, which served as a bedroom, office, and dining room.

They labored and produced in such wilderness, and lived in those thatched sheds. Two harsh winters passed, and Wu Xianzhen and the comrades who went up to the mountains and down to the countryside built embankments, reclaimed wasteland, and planted seeds together. Now, the Jin Lake wilderness has become a "land of rice and grain" with three crops a year; tens of thousands of fruit trees have also been planted on the red soil mountain. In the spring, all kinds of flowers bloom, and in the autumn, the fruits are plentiful, making it a real "Mountain of Flowers and Fruits." The residences have also changed from thatched sheds to brick and tile buildings. During the day, the tractors roar; at night, the electric lights shine, and the young people turn on the record player to dance and sing in their spare time...

Just as everyone was rejoicing over the fruits of their labor, Wu Xianzhen was ordered to go to a new battle post. He still carried the simple luggage he had when he first arrived and was joyfully sent off by the people to the other side of the Boyang River. There was another famous wilderness there—Yangliu洲 in De'an.

This洲 is dozens of *li* long. The洲 is covered with reeds and *Baimao* grass that are taller than people. When there is no wind, it looks like a flat green sea of grass from a distance. In order to understand the terrain of the grassy洲 and prepare for cultivation, Wu Xianzhen and several partners carried dry food and water bottles and went deep into the grassy洲 for surveying and measurement.

After the first steps of preparation, such as surveying, planning, and construction of work sheds for the development of Yangliu洲, were completed, they immediately carried out emergency reclamation and planting. In order to gain time, Wu Xianzhen also risked danger, passing through the Jiuxing Ridge area, where tigers often roam, to mobilize labor. He knew that there were tigers in Jiuxing Ridge, but he was not afraid. He and another comrade took a pistol and set off. When they walked to the mountain ridge behind Jiuxing Ridge, there were indeed two yellow-spotted tigers squatting on the road, baring a row of sharp white teeth and sticking out their red tongues to breathe. Wu Xianzhen only thought about completing the task as quickly as possible and did not look back. He first tried to shout a few times loudly to scare the tigers away, but the tigers still did not move. At this time, Wu Xianzhen raised his pistol and fired a shot. However, this shot made the tiger pounce on Wu Xianzhen like lightning. Wu Xianzhen understood that a small pistol could not kill the tiger, so he ran to the side, and the tiger also chased him. Seeing the danger of being caught up, they immediately had an idea when they saw a narrow and deep ditch in front of them and jumped into the ditch cleverly. The tiger pounced back and forth several times from the ditch surface, but because the ditch was narrow, it did not see them and ran away with its tail between its legs. They continued to move forward.

In just two or three days, they organized a land reclamation team in Bali and Baota, set up camp in the wilderness, and immediately began to reclaim and plant.

At this time, the lake洲 was boiling with activity, especially at night, with bonfires and gasoline lamps everywhere, and tractors coming and going. One night, as Wu Xianzhen was working hard, the captain of the mechanized farming team ran over in a huff and said, "Old Wu, the lights on three tractors are broken and cannot work at night."

Wu Xianzhen was anxious when he heard this. He thought: What should I do? The lights are broken at a time when we are rushing to speed up. He asked, "Can they be repaired?"

    "We have been trying to repair them for a long time, but we can't fix them. Either we go to Nanchang to repair them, or we drive them during the day and not at night."

"That won't work! I'll take a look." Wu Xianzhen and the captain of the mechanized farming team went to the mechanized farming area. After thinking about it, he finally used the principle of navigational marker lights to install flashlights at the turning and intersection points of the mechanized farming as guide marker lights, and installed two flashlights in front of the tractor as eyes, solving this difficulty.

After several months of hard work, Yangliu洲 took on a new look. In the past, it was a lake of grass and reeds, but today it has become a sea of rice, with lush and fertile rice seedlings nodding and swaying in the well-watered and fertile fields.

Just as people were preparing to harvest and celebrate the bumper harvest, Wu Xianzhen received instructions to develop "Wannian Lake" and headed to the third wilderness. The comrades who fought with Wu Xianzhen in Yangliu洲 reluctantly said goodbye to him.

"Seize the opportunity when the water recedes, enclose and reclaim South Lake (Wannian Lake), reclaim the more than 40,000 *mu* of sleeping lake洲 in the South Lake area to provide us with grain, and make use of the more than 10,000 *mu* of aquaculture water surface in the South Lake area. We must make South Lake a land of fish and rice in De'an." This is the grand plan of the De'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to immediately start developing the lake洲. The County Party Committee decided to appoint Wu Xianzhen as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the South Lake Enclosure Project.

"South Lake is a 'difficult' lake." People who have been to South Lake say this. South Lake is located on the edge of Poyang Lake, bordering Qingshanzui in Xingzi County to the east and Jiangyi in Yongxiu County to the west. The central area of South Lake has twenty-six unconnected small lakes and forty-eight unconnected barren洲, surrounded by two tributaries of the lower reaches of the Boyang River, which is like a large fishing net that has been spread out and torn. This winter and next spring, it is necessary to survey and build houses for several thousand people in this area, build a 31-*li*-long dike, and level and cultivate the twenty-six small lakes and forty-eight洲. This task is very arduous. However, the Communist Party member Wu Xianzhen, still with a mouthful of dry food and a mouthful of water, fought in South Lake and successfully completed the first phase of surveying, infrastructure construction, and material preparation.

At present, the South Lake enclosure project has started in full swing. In order to extract wealth from nature and obtain grain from the lake洲, Wu Xianzhen, with the never-disappearing confidence and enthusiasm of a Communist Party member, has devoted himself to this enclosure battle. He also boldly encouraged his partners and said: "Work hard, comrades! Today, this is a desolate barren洲 and uncultivated ridge, but tomorrow it will be a happy paradise of laughter and song."

    “老兵新传”续曲
    ——记下放干部吴先桢开垦荒洲野岭的模范事迹
    李秀全　袁冠良
    看过电影“老兵新传”的人，都为影片中主角——老战的那种“前人栽树、后人乘凉”的高贵品质深深感动。这里记述的，就是像老战那样的人物，他的名字叫吴先桢，是中共江西省德安县委的下放干部。几年来，他连续转战荒洲野岭，每当他胜利地把荒洲野岭开拓成“米粮川”的时候，就毫不犹豫地接受党的另一新的任务，奔向另一新的战斗岗位。德安县人民争相传诵着吴先桢的英雄事迹，称他为“老战式的共产党员”。
    吴先桢原是中共德安县委组织部副部长。1957年冬，省委号召干部上山下乡建设农村，吴先桢连续四次写申请书，表示决心“要以农村为家，以拓荒为职业”。县委根据他的决心和创办好国营垦殖场的需要，批准他下放担任共青垦殖场党委第一书记。
    严冬的一天，吴先桢背上简单的行装，带领着一批下放干部和一些知识青年，迎着冷嗖嗖的北风，踏上了征途，来到了千年无人开发的“金湖”。这里荒草比人还高。当时，有一位知识青年看到这样荒凉的原野，摇头叹息：“这个破摊子，要建设新农村，多难呀！”
      “是困难呀，不过我们是共产党人，有开天辟地的本领。困难最害怕有信心、有毅力的人。我们不要光看到今天的困难，应该想到灿烂的明天，你想想，我们今天的幸福生活，不也是革命前辈战胜了千重万重困难所创造出来的吗？”吴先桢在这种困难艰苦的情况下，从不放松对青年同志的政治思想教育。
    初来时，因房子不多，晚上几十个人挤在一间房子里睡。吴先桢和党委的另外三个同志，用几根竹子、几把草，搭起一个四面通风的棚子，既是寝室、办公室，又是膳厅。
    他们就在这样的荒野上劳动生产，就在那些草棚中生活。时间过去了两个严冬，吴先桢和上山下乡的同志们一道，挑土筑堤，垦荒播种。现在的金湖荒原成了一年三种三收的“米粮川”；红壤山上也栽种了万株果树。入春时节，百花齐放，到了秋天，果实累累，成了真正的“花果山”。住宅也由草棚变成砖瓦楼房。白天拖拉机轰隆隆响；晚上电灯闪亮，青年们在工余打开电唱机跳舞、歌唱。……
    正在大家为自己的劳动成果而欢乐的时候，吴先桢又奉命调到新的战斗岗位上去了。他仍带着初来时的简单行装，被人们欢送到博阳河对岸。那里又是一个有名的荒原——德安杨柳洲。
    这个洲足足有几十华里长。洲上长满了比人还高的芦苇和芭茅，无风时，远望像一片平坦的绿色草海。为了摸清草洲上的地势，准备进行耕种，吴先桢和几个伙伴带着干粮、水壶，深入草洲勘察测量。
    开发杨柳洲的勘测、规划、工棚基建等第一步准备工作完成后，他们紧接着又进行抢垦抢种。为了争取时间，吴先桢还冒着危险，穿过常有猛虎出没的九星岭一带，去调配劳力。他明知道九星岭有老虎，但他毫不惧怕，和另外一个同志带上一支手枪，迈步就走。当他们两人步行到九星岭背的山垅里时，真有两条黄斑猛虎蹲坐路上，呲开一排尖白的牙，伸出红色的舌头，在作呼吸。吴先桢只想着要争分夺秒完成任务，没有回头。他先试图拉高嗓音大喊几声，把老虎吓跑，可是，老虎仍一动不动。这时，吴先桢就举起手枪打了一枪。那知，这一枪，老虎像闪电似的向吴先桢扑来了。吴先桢明白一支小手枪是无法打死老虎的，便向旁边跑，老虎也横过来追人，眼见有追上的危险。他俩见前面一条细窄的深沟，立刻计上心头，机智地跳入沟内。老虎几次从沟面扑来扑去，因沟细窄，没有看见他俩，就夹着尾巴跑了。他俩又继续前进。
    只两三天工夫，他们便在八里、宝塔一带组织了拓荒队伍，在荒洲扎寨，就地开荒抢种了。
    这时，湖洲到处都沸腾起来了，尤其是晚上，到处都是篝火、汽灯，拖拉机来往奔驰着。一个晚上，吴先桢正干得起劲时，机耕队的队长气冲冲跑来，说：“老吴，有三台拖拉机上的灯坏了，夜里不能作业了”。
    吴先桢一听着了急，他想：这该怎么办？正在抢速度争时间的当儿，灯坏了。他问：“能不能修呀？”
    “我们修了很久修不好，要嘛就到南昌去修，要嘛就白天开，夜晚不开。”
    “那怎么行呢！我去看看。”吴先桢和机耕队长一道到了机耕作业区，经他左思右想，终于运用航海标志灯的原理，用手电筒安在机耕拐弯和交叉点上，作指引标志灯，在机头前安上两个手电筒当眼睛，把这个困难解决了。
    经过几个月的奋战，杨柳洲换上了新装。过去是一片湖草、芦苇，今天已成了一片稻海，青葱肥壮的禾苗，正在水饱肥足的田野里点头摇曳。
    就在人们准备收割、欢庆丰收的时候，吴先桢又接到了开发“万年湖”的指示，走向第三个荒原。和吴先桢一起大战杨柳洲的战友们，依依不舍地向他送别。
    “抓住水落时机，围垦南湖（万年湖），把南湖一带四万多亩沉睡的湖洲垦出来为我们献粮，把南湖一万多亩养殖水面利用起来，要南湖成为德安的鱼米之川。”这是中共德安县委决定立即动手开发湖洲的宏伟计划。县委决定派吴先桢为南湖围垦工程的副总指挥。
    “南湖就是‘难’湖”，到过南湖的人们都这样说，南湖位于鄱阳湖畔，东与星子县青山咀接壤，西与永修县江益毗邻。南湖中心地带有二十六个互不相通的小湖，和四十八个互不接通的荒洲，东西被博阳河下游二支流包围，真像一个撒开了的破烂不堪的大鱼网。今冬、明春要在这个地方勘测、建设几千人的房子，筑起一条三十一华里长的圩堤，并把二十六个小湖、四十八个洲地进行平整垦种。这个任务是很艰巨的。可是共产党员吴先桢，仍然是一口干粮一口水，转战南湖，出色地完成了第一阶段勘测、基建、备料等工作。
    目前，围垦南湖的工程全面动工了。吴先桢为了向自然索取财富，向湖洲要粮，他以一个共产党人永不消失的信心和干劲，投入这场围垦的战斗。他又豪迈地鼓励他的伙伴说：“好好干吧，同志们！今天这里是满目荒凉的荒洲野岭，明日一定又是一个欢笑、歌舞的幸福乐园。”
