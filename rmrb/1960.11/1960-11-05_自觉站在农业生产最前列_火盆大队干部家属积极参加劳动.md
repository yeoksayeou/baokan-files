Consciously Stand at the Forefront of Agricultural Production
    Family Members of Cadres in the Huopen Brigade Actively Participate in Labor

    (Report from our newspaper) Family members of cadres in the Huopen Brigade of the Huopen Commune in Jianyang County, Sichuan, have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party branch to "Cadres should be Red, and cadre family members should also be Red," and consciously stand at the forefront of agricultural production. This has directly promoted production and further strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses.

    Among the family members of cadres at the level of squad leader and above in this brigade, 109 have labor power, and 105 have been permanently fixed in field production. Since the beginning of this year, each person has participated in an average of more than 24 days of field labor per month. Zhu Guofang, the wife of Wang Fubang, the Party branch secretary of the brigade, was originally a nursery worker. At the beginning of this year, when the brigade decided to strengthen the agricultural front line, she was the first to apply. Zhang Yuezhen, the daughter of Zhang Liangcai, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, originally worked as a breeder, but she thought that the breeding work could be replaced by semi-labor, so she took the initiative to participate in front-line labor. In labor, the family members of cadres, like the cadres, competed to do heavy work. In February this year, when it was time to topdress wheat with fertilizer for jointing and booting, the sixth team could not transport manure to the fields in time because the wheat fields were far away and the slopes were steep, even though all the male laborers were mobilized. Zhu Danqun, the wife of Deputy Captain Wang Zenghua, volunteered to carry manure uphill, and cadre family members Tang Guiying and Wang Xianqun also actively participated in the fertilizer transportation team. Under the influence of the cadre family members, more than 30 women in the team encouraged each other, competing to transport fertilizer, throw soil, and mound the roots, and finally the whole team completed the task of topdressing and mounding the wheat fields. Under the leadership of cadres and cadre family members, the Huopen Brigade's front-line labor force has often remained at around 82%, and labor efficiency has continued to improve.

    All the cadre family members in the brigade are very frugal in their daily lives, treat the commune members equally, and are strict with themselves. The Huopen Brigade is very close to the market town, but the cadre family members have managed to avoid going to the market unless necessary and not spending a penny recklessly. Most of them have household savings plans and deposit their savings in credit cooperatives. Under the leadership of the cadre family members, almost every family in the brigade has savings.

    The exemplary actions of the cadre family members are deeply welcomed by the commune members, which further strengthens the ties between the cadres and the masses, making the commune members more trusting and loving of the cadres. Fifty-six cadre family members in the brigade have been rated as "Five-Good" commune members by the masses, and sixteen have been considered "All-Red" families. Everyone takes them as examples to learn from.

    The good performance of the cadre family members in the Huopen Brigade is mainly due to the good job of political and ideological education. The Party branch regards improving the political and ideological awareness of cadre family members as an important task. Since the beginning of this year, it has held three symposiums for cadre family members, launched an education movement of "No Backward Cadre Family Members" and "Everyone Striving to Be the Best" in the entire brigade, and helped cadre family members establish the idea of taking active labor and thrift as an honor and extravagance, waste, pleasure, and laziness as a shame. The branch also loudly put forward the slogan "Cadres should be Red, and cadre family members should also be Red," and decided that each cadre should educate his family well, and that the quality of family education work should be one of the criteria for cadre assessment. The branch secretary and the five committee members and other main cadres took the lead in making samples, first doing a good job of their own family work. In order to ensure the regular family education work, a monthly appraisal competition is also carried out, mobilizing the masses to appraise and establish pacesetters.

    自觉站在农业生产最前列
    火盆大队干部家属积极参加劳动
    本报讯　四川简阳县火盆公社火盆大队的干部家属，热烈响应党支部提出的“干部红、干部家属也红”的号召，在生产上自觉地站在农业生产最前列。直接推动了生产，同时也进一步密切了干群关系。
    这个大队小队长以上的干部家属中，有劳动力的有一百零九名，长期固定在田间生产的就有一百零五人。今年以来每人每月参加田间劳动平均在二十四天以上。大队党支部书记王富邦的爱人朱国芳原来是个保育员，今年初大队决定增强农业第一线时，她第一个提出申请。党支部副书记张良材的女儿张跃珍，原来担任饲养员工作，但她想到饲养工作可由半劳力来代替，就主动参加第一线劳动。在劳动中，干部家属们像干部一样争着干重活。今年2月，正是给小麦追施拔节孕穗肥时，六小队因麦地远坡路陡，男劳力全部出动仍不能及时挑粪下地。副队长王增华的爱人朱丹群便自告奋勇挑粪上坡，干部家属唐桂英、王仙群也踊跃参加了运肥队伍。在干部家属影响下，全队三十多名妇女相互激励，争着运肥、抛土、壅兜，终于使全队完成了麦田的追肥壅兜任务。火盆大队社员在干部和干部家属的带头劳动下，第一线劳力经常保持在82％左右，劳动效率不断提高。
    全大队干部家属在日常生活上非常俭朴，与社员相处中平等待人，并严格要求自己。火盆大队距离场镇很近，但干部家属们都做到了无事不赶场、不乱花一文钱。他们大都订有家庭节约计划，把节约的钱存到信用社里。全大队在干部家属的带动下，差不多家家都有储蓄。
    干部家属的模范行动，深受社员的欢迎，从而进一步密切干部和群众的联系，使社员对干部更加信任和爱戴。全大队干部家属中有五十六名被群众评为“五好”社员，有十六个被认为是“全家红”家庭。大家把他们作为学习的榜样。
    火盆大队的干部家属表现得好，关键在于作好了政治思想教育。党支部把提高干部家属政治思想觉悟作为一项重要工作，今年以来曾召开了三次干部家属座谈会，在全大队开展了“干部家属无落后”、“人人争上游”的教育运动，帮助干部家属树立以积极劳动勤俭节约为荣、以铺张浪费享乐怠惰为耻的思想。支部还响亮提出“干部红、干部家属也要红”的口号，决定每个干部都要教育好家属，家属教育工作作得好坏，作为干部考核标准之一。支部书记和五个委员等主要干部带头作出样本，首先作好自己的家属工作。为了保证家属教育工作经常化，每月还开展一次评比竞赛，发动群众评比、树标兵。
