Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Japanese Communist Party General Secretary Kenji Miyamoto stated that if Japan's progressive parties do not wage an uncompromising struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Ikeda Cabinet, it will be impossible to realize Japan's neutrality and abolish the "Security Treaty."

Miyamoto requested voters to cast their ballots for the Communist Party because the Communist Party is an uncompromising fighter for the establishment of a democratic united government against the "Security Treaty." Miyamoto Kenji made these remarks yesterday at a press conference held in Fukuoka City during his election campaign tour.

Miyamoto also condemned NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) and other radio stations for excluding the Communist Party from broadcast programs and depriving the Communist Party of the opportunity to make appeals to the people through radio stations.

Miyamoto said that this shows that the election campaign, both in the past and now, is not fair, even though radio stations and newspapers have been clamoring about "clean elections."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial today, calling on JCP members to concentrate their efforts on smashing the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries to sabotage the JCP's election campaign.

The editorial condemned the U.S.-Japan reactionaries for frantically sabotaging the JCP's election activities in the final stage of the election struggle by using the police, right-wing groups, splitters, and newspapers, radio stations, and television stations.

"Akahata" pointed out that the purpose of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries is clearly to try to separate the JCP from the Japanese people and further undermine the unity of patriotic and democratic forces.

The editorial condemned those bourgeois newspapers, radio stations, and television stations that act as propaganda machines for the U.S.-Japan reactionaries in the election campaign.

"Akahata" called on all party members to use all of the Party's publications, concentrate all their efforts to launch a struggle, smash the enemy's obstruction, interference, and oppression, and at the same time, go deep among the masses to publicize the JCP's policies in order to win victory for the JCP in the election.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: With the connivance of the Ikeda government, Japanese fascist thugs actually stabbed a Communist Party election worker in order to sabotage the JCP's election campaign.

This incident occurred last night in Kamisunagawa Town in central Hokkaido. Fascist thugs stabbed Hiroichi Suzuki, an employee of the local workers' clinic, three times in the lower abdomen. Suzuki is an election worker for Communist Party candidate Toshio Toyoshima. The thugs fled after the attack. Passersby found the victim lying in a pool of blood on a street near the clinic and immediately took him to the clinic. Due to excessive blood loss, the victim's condition is serious.

The Sunagawa branch of the Japanese Communist Party lodged a serious protest with the police against this incident of extreme right-wing elements sabotaging the election.

    日共总书记宫本就大选问题向进步政党发出号召
    必须坚决同美日反动派作斗争
    “赤旗报”号召全力粉碎反动派破坏日共竞选活动的阴谋
    在池田政府的纵容下法西斯暴徒竟然刺伤日共竞选工作者
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本共产党总书记宫本显治说，日本的进步政党如果不同美帝国主义和池田内阁进行毫不妥协的斗争，是不可能实现日本的中立和废除“安全条约”的。
    宫本要求选民投共产党的票，因为共产党是争取成立反对“安全条约”的民主联合政府的毫不妥协的战士。宫本显治是昨天在竞选旅行中在福冈市举行的记者招待会上这样说的。
    宫本还谴责日本广播协会和其它电台把共产党排除在广播节目之外，并剥夺共产党通过广播电台向人民发出号召的机会。
    宫本说，这说明：竞选运动过去和现在都不是公正的，虽然电台和报纸一直在叫嚷什么“廉洁的选举”。
    新华社16日讯　日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论，号召日共党员集中力量，粉碎美日反动派破坏日共竞选活动的阴谋。
    社论谴责美日反动派在竞选斗争的最后阶段利用警察、右翼团体、分裂主义者和报纸、广播电台、电视台等疯狂地破坏日共进行竞选活动。
      “赤旗报”指出，美日反动派的目的显然是企图把日共和日本人民割裂开来，进一步破坏爱国民主力量的团结。
    社论谴责在竞选活动中作为美日反动派的宣传机器的那些资产阶级报纸、广播电台和电视台。
      “赤旗报”号召全体党员运用党的一切出版物，集中全力展开斗争，粉碎敌人的阻碍、干涉和压迫，同时深入群众，宣传日共的政策，以争取日共在选举中获得胜利。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：在池田政府纵容下，日本法西斯暴徒竟然刺伤共产党的竞选工作者，来破坏日共的竞选活动。
    这个事件是昨天晚间在北海道中部的上砂川町发生的。法西斯暴徒向当地工人诊疗所的职员铃木博一的下腹部刺了三刀。铃木是共产党候选人丰岛俊男的竞选工作者。暴徒行凶后逃走。行人在诊疗所附近的街上发现受害者躺在血泊中，立即把他送到诊疗所。由于流血过多，受害者情况严重。
    日本共产党砂川支部对这一极端右翼分子破坏竞选的事件向警察提出严重抗议。
