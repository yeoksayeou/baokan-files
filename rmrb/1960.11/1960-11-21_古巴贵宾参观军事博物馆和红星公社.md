After Major Guevara listened to a brief introduction by Museum Director Major General Jia Ruoyu, he immediately expressed their desire to first visit the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Hall. Facing many pictures and objects in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Hall, the distinguished guests witnessed the great victory of the Chinese and Korean people and the disastrous defeat of the American aggressor troops.

The distinguished guests also went to the Comprehensive Hall to view the armed struggle situation of the Chinese revolution in various historical periods under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

Major Guevara enthusiastically inscribed a message for the museum. In his inscription, he wrote: "This museum is full of heroic history and great victories, and it also reflects the hope of the people of this country for peace and work. They only rose up to fight when the enemy gave them no other way out. We have learned from this visit."

At the museum, Major Guevara also held talks with Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of National Defense, Major General Wang Xinggang, Deputy Director of the Department of American and Australian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Ping, and others who accompanied the visit.

When the distinguished guests arrived at the commune in the morning mist, Commune Director Zhao Biao and other responsible persons warmly welcomed them at the main intersection, expressing their respect for the envoys of the heroic Cuban people. During the distinguished guests' visit to the commune's agriculture, industry, animal husbandry, and welfare facilities, Major Guevara and others asked the hosts with great interest about the organization and management of the people's commune, production undertakings, and the lives and welfare of the members.

The distinguished guests had cordial talks with the commune members during their visits to various places, expressing their appreciation for the members' enthusiasm for labor and the commune's raising of a large group of strong horses, dairy cows, fat pigs, and chickens and ducks. Major Guevara also took photos in many places. When he arrived at the horse farm, Major Guevara saw the cart-pulling horses and took the reins from the breeder, personally driving the cart for a quick circle on the road. After he jumped out of the cart, he praised the cart-pulling horse as very good.

At the time of farewell, Major Guevara shook hands cordially with Zhao Biao and said: Cuba also has many cooperatives, and today's visit here is very interesting.
