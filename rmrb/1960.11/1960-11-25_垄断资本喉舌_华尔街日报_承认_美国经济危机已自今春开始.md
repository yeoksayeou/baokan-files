Mouthpiece of Monopoly Capital "Wall Street Journal" Admits:
    US Economic Crisis Began This Spring
    (Reported by this newspaper) Following the US government's announcement that the US Gross National Product for the third quarter of this year, calculated at an annual rate, decreased by 1.5 billion US dollars compared to the second quarter, the US bourgeois press has become increasingly pessimistic about the US economic outlook. On November 7th, the US "Newsweek" reported that many economists in the US government predicted that the US Gross National Product would continue to decline in the fourth quarter of this year, and would even decline by another 8.5 billion US dollars in the first and second quarters of next year. The "Wall Street Journal" also published an article on November 14th entitled "Estimates of Current Corporate and Financial Trends." The author, George Shea, admitted that "judging from the existing economic figures," the US "economic recession" "began in the spring of this year or even earlier." After pointing out that the number of employed people in the United States in October decreased by 277,000 compared to September, "while according to normal seasonal expectations, October should have increased by 400,000," he wrote uneasily:
    "Steel production remains disappointing, and this factor alone will cause the Federal Reserve Board's industrial production index for October to decline." And "the seasonally adjusted index for September was 107, the lowest figure in ten months." "Another statistic that illustrates the continued weakness of enterprises is the order for machine tools. Orders in September were lower than in August, and also lower than in September last year. According to preliminary reports for October, the situation has not improved much. Since these orders take an average of several months to deliver, this shows that factories will reduce capital expenditure this winter." He also said: "From January to October this year, monthly construction expenditure was about 55 billion US dollars at an annual rate. This figure is almost the same as in the last few months of 1959, but in most months earlier last year, this figure reached more than 56 billion US dollars, and exceeded 57 billion US dollars in a few months. Housing starts continue to be far below the 1959 level, and the amount of residential construction contracts does not seem to have much rebound in the coming months."
    The author also refuted the argument currently held by some American bourgeois economists who, in order to whitewash the American economic situation, lightly describe this crisis as merely an "inventory adjustment." He said: "It must be clearly remembered what is really happening, because people are casually talking about the current inventory adjustment, which is about to pass. In fact, the so-called adjustment is just taking the form of stopping the accumulation of inventory. In the first half of this year, the total amount of enterprise inventory increased month by month, and in the three months after that, only one hundred million US dollars was reduced each month from the inventory of 93 billion US dollars, which was almost unchanged." He also said: "The important point is that the inventory is still about 4 billion US dollars more than a year ago, while sales have only increased by 1 billion US dollars per month. Since the total inventory is about equal to one and a half months of sales, an increase of 1 billion US dollars in sales only requires an increase of 1.5 billion US dollars in inventory." The author also anxiously pointed out that the sluggishness of new orders, which can better illustrate the trend of enterprises. "Manufacturing inventories increased by 3 billion US dollars, while new orders only increased by 500 million US dollars per month." Finally, the author believes that American corporate inventories "may be further reduced," which means that industrial production will further decline.

### 垄断资本喉舌“华尔街日报”承认  美国经济危机已自今春开始

    垄断资本喉舌“华尔街日报”承认
    美国经济危机已自今春开始
    本报讯　在美国官方公布美国今年第三季度的国民生产总值按年率计算比第二季下降了十五亿美元之后，美国资产阶级报刊对美国经济前景的预测已越来越悲观。11月7日美国“新闻周刊”报道，美国政府中许多经济学者都预测今年第四季美国国民生产总值将继续下降，明年第一季和第二季甚至将再下降八十五亿美元。“华尔街日报”11月14日也发表了题为“对目前企业和财政趋势的估计”的文章。作者乔治·谢承认，“从现有的经济数字来看”，美国的“经济衰退”“在今年春天或者甚至更早一些时候”就已开始。他在指出美国10月份就业人数比9月份减少二十七万七千人，“而根据正常的季节性的预料，10月份应当增加四十万人”之后不安地写道：
    “钢铁生产仍然令人失望，这个因素本身就会使10月份的联邦储备委员会的10月份工业生产指数下降。”而“按经过季节调整后的9月份指数是一百零七，为十个月来最低数字。”“另一个说明企业继续疲软的统计数字是工作母机的订货。9月份的订货低于8月份，也低于去年9月份。根据10月份的初步报告，情况仍无多大好转。由于这些订货平均需要几个月以后才交货，这说明工厂在今年冬天的资本开支将减少。”他并说：“今年1月到10月，每月的建筑开支在年率的五百五十亿美元左右。这个数字同1959年最后几个月差不多，但是在去年早些时候的大部分月份，这个数字曾达五百六十亿美元以上，有几个月曾超过五百七十亿美元。房屋开工率继续大大低于1959年水平，住宅建筑合同额在今后几个月看来也不会有很大回升。”
    对于目前一部分美国资产阶级经济学者为粉饰美国经济情况把这次危机轻描淡写地称为不过是一次“存货的调整”的论调，作者也作了反驳。他说：“必须清楚记住真正发生的情况，因为人们都在随便谈论说，目前在进行存货调整，而这种调整即将过去。实际上，所谓调整只是采取停止积累存货的方式。在今年上半年，企业存货总额逐月增加，在那时以后的三个月中，九百三十亿美元的存货中，每月只减少一亿美元，几乎没有变动。”他又说：“重要之点是，存货仍然比一年前多大约四十亿美元，而销售额每月仅增加十亿美元。由于存货总额大约等于一个半月的销售额，增加十亿美元的销售额只需要增加十五亿美元的存货就够了。”作者还忡忡不安地指出更能说明企业趋势的新订货额的不振。“制造业的存货增加了三十亿美元，而新订货额每月只增加五亿美元。”最后作者认为美国企业存货
  “可能要进一步减少”，这也就是说，工业生产将进一步下降。
