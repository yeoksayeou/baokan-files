    Learn from Deng Xiumei by Immersing Oneself Deeply in the Front Lines
    -- Thoughts After Rereading "Mountain Village Changes"
    Zhengzhou Normal College　Feng Guangzhen
    On the eve of being approved to settle down in the countryside, with a heart eager to learn, I reread Comrade Zhou Libo's "Mountain Village Changes." Although it was a reread, every moving plot and every vivid character in the novel still evoked many wonderful associations and left a deep impression in my mind. The novel led me into a hilly area "surrounded by continuous, dark tree-covered and bamboo-covered mountains, with a large open space in the middle, a flat plain, and the soil in the fields was black and very fertile." Thinking about it, I seemed to have entered the agricultural front line that I had longed for for a long time - mountain villages surrounded by mountains and rivers, lush and green, and endless plains with rolling wheat waves. Especially when facing Deng Xiumei, a county-level cadre in the work, my determination and confidence in requesting to be transferred to lower levels were suddenly enhanced, and my whole body was filled with infinite power. I was doubly happy and admired this short-haired young girl. She is an outstanding cadre of the people and a good example for our young people to learn from. Especially for our young friends who have already been transferred to lower levels and are about to rush to the agricultural front, it has more realistic educational significance.
    "Mountain Village Changes" is a good work reflecting the agricultural cooperativization movement in our country. Although it only focuses on depicting the tremendous changes that took place in a mountain village in Hunan Province - Qingxi Township - where farmers organized cooperatives. In the great changes of this "mountain village," we can see the entire lineup of Chinese farmers, especially poor and lower-middle peasants, who, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, went to the road of cooperativization with joy after intricate and complex ideological struggles. Deng Xiumei, the deputy secretary of the County Communist Youth League, participated in and led the entire movement process of Qingxi Township from two mutual aid groups that were almost collapsed and disintegrated to the construction of a cooperative. We can learn many valuable qualities from this image of an excellent cadre of the Party.
    Deng Xiumei's series of activities, the most impressive to me is her careful and thorough working style of immersing herself in the masses at any time and anywhere. This is an important virtue that every cadre of our Party and comrades engaged in mass work must possess. This can be seen from the first chapter, "Entering the Village," which describes her settling down in the countryside - Qingxi Township - from the city. This female cadre who went deep into the masses met Ting Mianhu, an old man carrying bamboo, on the road by the mountain. From Ting Mianhu's mouth, she obtained a lot of information about Qingxi Township. In the evening, she rushed to Qingxi Township, and before entering the township government, she met Sheng Shujun at the well. Taking this opportunity, she learned a lot about the development of the cooperative movement in the township from this girl. Because she had mastered this information in advance, when she gave a report to the Party members of the whole township in "That Night" (Chapter 3), she was able to specifically cite Ting Mianhu's example, "arousing everyone's interest, listening attentively and remembering carefully," helping her "accurately and vividly convey the spirit of the county party committee's three-level cadre meeting and the main points of Secretary Mao's report." After she contacted Li Yuehui, the secretary of the Party branch, and Chen Dachun, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, she immediately established a close comradeship with them. Later, with the deepening development of the cooperative movement, whether it was doing mass work, such as mobilizing Chen Xianjin to join the society (see Chapter 14) or uniting cadres, such as uniting and educating Chen Dachun, Liu Yusheng, etc.; cracking down on sabotage activities, chasing cattle in the middle of the night (Chapter 19)... all vividly showed her down-to-earth working style of immersing herself in the masses. The reason why this twenty-two-year-old young cadre was able to go so deep into the masses was, on the one hand, because she had a clear mass viewpoint, sincerely loved the people, and could listen to their opinions and care about their vital interests; on the other hand, it was also the result of her being able to go up and down, putting down the airs of a cadre, and eating, living, working, and discussing with the masses.
    Asking for instructions and relying on the organization, uniting cadres, believing in the majority of the masses, and actively and conscientiously implementing the Party's policies are another aspect of qualities that we should learn from Deng Xiumei. This is most prominently demonstrated in Chapters 19 and 22 of "Mountain Village Changes." Taking Chapter 22, "Cutting Down Trees," as an example, the counter-revolutionary element Gong Ziyuan spread the rumor that "mountains will be turned over to the public without compensation," which once caused confusion among the masses and caused a "tree-cutting frenzy." At that time, during an emergency meeting of cadres in the township to discuss countermeasures, there were different opinions among the cadres. Chen Dachun advocated: "If you don't tie up a few, you can't stop the chaos." Deng Xiumei firmly believed that using the method of tying up people to stop tree cutting was "too rude" because this was not a matter of one or two people, but a mass problem that needed to be "patiently reasoned with." As a result, Deng Xiumei's countermeasure achieved good results.
    The class struggle and ideological struggle in the countryside are sharp and complex. In this environment, Deng Xiumei was able to always maintain a clear head, keenly analyze every object placed in front of her, and point out the inherent essence of things through the appearance of things. Without political sensitivity to analyze and discern things and a down-to-earth working style among the masses, it would be impossible to do this.
    In addition to this, Deng Xiumei has many other things worth learning from, such as the calmness, composure, hard work, and carefulness she shows in handling things, and not caring about personal honor or disgrace, etc., are all examples for our actions. Of course, the more fundamental reason why Deng Xiumei was able to show her talents in the countryside is the Party's cultivation and education of her. If Deng Xiumei did not have the glorious qualities of being loyal to the Party's cause, if she was not good at understanding and resolutely implementing the Party's policies, and if she could not closely rely on the Party's organization in her work, she would not be able to achieve anything.
    On the eve of preparing to rush to the first line of agricultural production, I reread "Mountain Village Changes" and felt particularly close to the image of this excellent young cadre created by the author. My excited mood could not calm down for a long time. Deng Xiumei is my role model. I must learn from Deng Xiumei, live up to the Party's education, and do the glorious work that the Party has entrusted to me.

    学邓秀梅那样深入第一线
    ——重读《山乡巨变》所想到的
    郑州师范学院　冯广珍
    在被批准到农村安家落户的前夕，我怀着求师拜友的心情，重读了周立波同志的《山乡巨变》。虽是重读，小说中的每一段动人的情节，每一个栩栩如生的人物，在我的脑海里，仍能引起许多美妙的联想，留下深刻的印象。小说把我领进了“四周净是连绵不断的、黑洞洞的树山和竹山，中间是一片大塅，一坦平阳，田里的泥土发黑，十分肥沃”的丘陵之乡。转念一想，我仿佛又进入久已渴望的农业第一线——依山傍水、郁郁葱葱的山村和一望无垠、麦浪翻滚的平原。特别是面对作品中的县干部邓秀梅，要求下放的决心和信心，骤然增强，浑身增添了无穷的力量，对这位短发的年青姑娘，倍加欢喜和敬佩。她是一位人民群众的优秀干部，我们青年学习的好榜样。尤其对我们已经下放和即将奔赴农业战线的青年朋友来说，更具有现实的教育意义。
    《山乡巨变》是一部反映我国农业合作化运动的好作品。尽管它只是重点地描绘了湖南省一个山乡——清溪乡农民组织合作社所发生的巨变。就在这个“山乡”的巨变中，我们能看到，我国的农民群众，尤其是贫农和下中农，在党和毛主席的领导下，经过错综复杂的思想斗争，最后欢欣鼓舞地走向合作化道路的整个阵容。作品中的邓秀梅——县团委副书记，从头到尾参加并领导了清溪乡由两个几乎垮台、散伙的互助组到建成合作社的运动过程。从这位党的优秀干部形象的身上，我们可以学习到许多宝贵的品质。
    邓秀梅的一系列活动，首先给我印象最深刻的是她仔细地、随时随地深入群众的工作作风。这是我们党的每一个干部和作群众工作的同志，都必须具备的重要品德。这从第一章《入乡》中，写她从城里到农村——清溪乡安家落户的一段情节就可以看出来。这个深入群众的女干部在山边的路上，就结识了掮竹子的老倌子亭面糊。由亭面糊口中得到许多有关清溪乡的情况。傍晚，她赶到清溪乡，还没有走进乡政府，又在井边结识了盛淑君，借这个机会，从这位姑娘嘴内知道了不少该乡合作化运动开展的情况。由于她事先掌握了这些材料，在《当夜》（第三章）给全乡党员作报告的时候，就能具体地举出亭面糊的例子，“引起了大家的兴致，都专心地听，用心地记，”帮助她“准确而又生动地传达了县委三级干部会议的精神和毛书记的报告要点。”当她与党支部书记李月辉和团支部书记陈大春接触以后，马上就同他们建立了亲密的同志友谊。后来，伴随合作化运动的深入发展，不管是做群众工作，如动员陈先晋入社（见十四章）或团结干部，如团结教育陈大春、刘雨生等；破获破坏活动，深夜追牛（十九章）……都生动地显示了她的踏实的深入群众的工作作风。这个二十二岁的青年干部，所以能够如此深入群众，一方面是由于她具有着明确的群众观点，真挚地热爱人民群众，才能倾听群众意见，关心群众的切身利益；另方面也是她能上能下，放下干部架子，与群众同吃同住同劳动同商量的结果。
    遇事请示和依靠组织，团结干部，相信群众的多数，积极认真执行党的政策，是我们应该向邓秀梅学习的另一方面的品质。这在《山乡巨变》的十九、二十二章，表现得最突出，仅就二十二章《砍树》而言，反革命分子龚子元散布“山要无代价地归公”的谣言曾经一度在群众中造成混乱，闹起了“砍树风潮”，当时在全乡干部紧急会议讨论对策时，干部中间有着不同的意见。陈大春主张：“不捆个把，止不住帐”。邓秀梅则坚决认为用捆人的办法制止砍树“太粗鲁”，因为这不是一两个人的事情，而是一个群众性的问题，需要“耐心地说理”。结果还是邓秀梅的对策取得了良好的效果。    农村的阶级斗争，思想斗争是尖锐的、复杂的，在这种环境中，邓秀梅能够始终保持清醒的头脑，敏锐地分析每一件摆在她面前的事物，透过事物的表象，指出事物的内在本质。没有善于分析洞察事物的政治敏感和踏实的群众工作作风，是做不到这一点的。
    除此而外，邓秀梅还有许多值得我们学习之处，如在处理事情中表现出来的沉着持重，镇静老练，刻苦耐劳，大胆细心，不计较个人荣辱等等，都是我们行动的榜样。当然，邓秀梅所以能够在农村这样大显身手，更根本的原因是在于党对她的培养和教育。如果邓秀梅没有忠于党的事业的光辉品质，如果她不是善于领会和坚决执行党的政策，如果她不能在工作中紧紧依靠党的组织，她也是不可能有所作为的。
    在准备奔赴农业生产第一线的前夕，我重读了《山乡巨变》，对于作者所创造的这个优秀青年干部的形象，感到特别亲切，激动的心情久久不能平息下来，邓秀梅就是我的榜样，我一定要向邓秀梅学习，不辜负党的教养，做好党交付给我的光荣的工作。
