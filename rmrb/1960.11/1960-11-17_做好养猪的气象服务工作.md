Do a Good Job in Meteorological Services for Pig Raising
Rao Xing, Deputy Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau

All living things on Earth live at the bottom of the atmospheric "ocean." Various organisms are affected by meteorological conditions throughout their growth and development. To seriously study the relationship between various crops, livestock, poultry, etc., and meteorological conditions, and to find out the laws of what meteorological conditions they "need and fear," so as to make full use of and create favorable meteorological conditions through human efforts, and to avoid and prevent unfavorable meteorological conditions, is an important link in promoting the high-speed development of agriculture and animal husbandry, and is also the main task of the meteorological department.

Pigs are animals and, of course, are affected by meteorological conditions. Chinese farmers have a long history of raising pigs for thousands of years, and have accumulated rich experience. This experience is concentrated in many folk proverbs. Such as: "When the plum rains fall, piglets suffer from many diseases"; "Not afraid of a large piece of sunshine, only afraid of a line of draft"; "Pigs that survive a winter, half are lost." The experience of farmers in Xinhua County, Hunan Province in raising pigs using meteorology is: "Small pigs should roam, large pigs should be confined. Pigs in the grass, grow little hair and not much meat. When piglets are born in cold weather, fires should be burned in the pens; when piglets are born in hot weather, the pens should be ventilated. Food should be on time and feed should be sufficient, the pens should face south and the ground should be dry. When the weather is dry and hot, there are many diseases, and when it is neither cold nor hot, it is most suitable." These proverbs scientifically illustrate the relationship between the pig industry and meteorological conditions.

Since the central government issued the call to raise pigs on a large scale, China's pig raising industry has developed rapidly. Feed bases have been established one after another; some experience has been gained in feeding management; and a professional pig raising team has been basically formed. All of these have laid a good foundation for the large-scale development of the pig raising industry. However, there are still some problems at present. For example, the survival rate of piglets in some areas is not high, weight gain is slow, and infectious diseases are more common. There are many reasons for these problems. After our investigation, research, and practice, it has been proven that the failure to master and control climatic conditions is one of the main reasons affecting the normal growth and development of pigs, and even the death of pigs.

The meteorological factors that affect the normal growth and development of pigs are mainly sudden changes in the external weather, which cause drastic changes in the temperature and humidity inside the pigsty. At this time, if the temperature and humidity of the pigsty are not controlled manually, they will change with the external weather; if the pigsty structure can resist cold and heat, and people can fully grasp the laws of pig requirements for meteorological conditions, they can control the temperature and humidity in the pigsty according to future weather changes, and adjust the environment suitable for pig growth and development. If the temperature conditions in the pigsty are suitable, the pig's metabolism is normal, it is full of energy, and its appetite increases. Even if the feed is slightly rough, it can quickly gain weight. At the same time, because it is strong, it can resist cold, heat, and disease. If the temperature is too high or too low, the pig's metabolism will be abnormal, the pig will be in poor spirits, and its appetite will be poor. Even if it is fed fine feed, it will not gain weight quickly, or it will lose weight, and because it is weak, it is prone to catching cold, suffering from heatstroke, and even death. Humidity is mainly related to the evaporation of water in the pig's body, and the evaporation of water affects the dissipation of heat in the pig's body. Therefore, humidity and temperature are mutually conditional and mutually influential. Especially in late autumn and early winter and late winter and early spring, the temperature and humidity rise and fall sharply, and the changes are drastic. If no protection and regulation are taken, the pigs will not easily adapt. This phenomenon mainly occurs during the alternating seasons of cold and warm and during the invasion of cold waves. As for the transportation of live pigs, whether the climate is suitable or not is also an important issue. Live pigs are accustomed to the local climatic conditions. Once they encounter sudden cold and heat and the different climate in the transportation process, they are often prone to disease. In addition, meteorological conditions also have some indirect effects on live pigs. For example, germs or parasites that cause epidemics in live pigs are prone to breed and spread when meteorological conditions are suitable, causing live pigs to become ill. It can be seen that temperature and humidity have an extremely important impact on the feeding and management of live pigs.

Generally speaking, the temperature suitable for pig growth and development is between 10 and 25 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity is between 40% and 75%. However, the requirements of pigs for meteorological conditions vary depending on the location, time, breed, climate, stage of growth and development, equipment, and level of feeding management. According to the research of meteorological departments in various places, in the Chifeng area of ​​Inner Mongolia, a temperature of 10 to 12 degrees Celsius and a relative humidity of about 30% to 40% are most conducive to the growth and development of pigs; while in the Chenzhou area of ​​Hunan, a temperature of 20 to 24 degrees Celsius and a relative humidity of about 75% are the most suitable, the difference between the two is very large. Even in the same area, if the season is different, the adapted temperature and humidity conditions are also different. According to the materials from the Banquan People's Commune in Junan County, Shandong Province, the suitable temperature for sows and piglets is 10 to 15 degrees Celsius in autumn and 15 to 18 degrees Celsius in spring. Not only that, but the requirements for temperature and humidity are also different for live pigs in different stages of growth and development. Experiments in the Twenty-Three Li Commune of Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, have proved that the suitable temperature and humidity for piglets and sows are 15 to 22 degrees Celsius and 65% to 75% respectively, while the suitable temperature and humidity for fattening pigs are 12 to 20 degrees Celsius and 70% to 80% respectively. Therefore, in order to make meteorological service work adapt to this complex requirement, it is necessary to strengthen investigation and research, and rely on the joint efforts of local people, animal husbandry production departments, and meteorological departments.

Creating a pigsty microclimate suitable for pig growth and development is a problem worthy of attention. Because pigsties have the functions of preventing wind and rain, keeping warm, etc., the meteorological conditions such as temperature, humidity, light, wind, and rain in the pigsty are different from those in the natural world. Within the pigsty, there are also large differences in various meteorological elements in various parts. For example, there are large differences in temperature, humidity, and other meteorological elements between different heights in the pigsty and between sunny and shady places. The microclimate characteristics of pigsties with different designs are also different. When the Tianlongshan Farm in Xinhua County, Hunan Province was first built in 1958, due to the failure to grasp climate change and the lack of feeding management experience, the pigs were greatly affected by disastrous weather and the mortality rate was high. In April 1959, under the personal leadership of the farm's party committee, the Xinhua County Meteorological Service Station and the Meteorological Society conducted observations of temperature and humidity changes in the pigsty and carried out mass meteorological service work. As a result, the mortality rate of pigs was reduced to 0.13%, the incidence rate was reduced to 3.4%, and the survival rate of piglets was increased to 97%. The entire farm basically achieved "six no's" (no hog cholera, no erysipelas, no pneumonia, no abortion, no empty pregnancy, no piglet death).

Meteorological conditions not only have an important impact on the growth and development of live pigs, but also have a close relationship with pig breeding, semen collection, mating, pregnancy, gestation, farrowing, and the occurrence and prevalence of epidemic diseases. Correctly grasping these laws can make pigs reproduce quickly and get sick less often. According to existing indicators, artificial insemination of pigs should not be carried out on rainy days, but should be carried out when the weather is sunny and the temperature is around 10 to 20 degrees Celsius. At the same time, the temperature of the semen collection cup of the artificial insemination device should be maintained at around 25 degrees Celsius in order to prolong the life of the sperm. According to the above indicators, the Wantou Pig Farm of Yingzhuang People's Commune in Nanyang, Henan Province used No. 1 Ukrainian pigs and local sows for hybridization. As a result, one litter produced 21 piglets, 15 more than a sow that was mated in estrus on a cloudy day, increasing the reproduction rate by more than two times. Meteorological conditions also play an important role in the onset and treatment of pig diseases. In February this year, two pigs at the Tianlongshan Farm in Xinhua County fell ill and were paralyzed. After 57 days of ineffective treatment. Later, after a joint investigation and study by the meteorologist and the animal husbandry technician, it was clarified that it was rheumatism caused by long-term low temperature and high humidity. Later, the two pigs were moved to another area for feeding, which changed the meteorological conditions. The temperature of the pigsty was often maintained at around 10 to 20 degrees Celsius, the relative humidity was 72% to 78%, the windows were opened on sunny days, fires were lit and straw was added in cold waves, and wind holes were blocked. After adding some fine feed in feeding, the two pigs completely recovered their health after only 37 days. More than four months after the illness was cured, the average monthly growth was more than 20 catties. The masses praised: "The meteorology is accurate, the meteorology is effective, no medicine is needed, no injections are given, and meteorology is used to treat pig diseases."

Although, some experience has been accumulated in meteorological services for pig raising in various places, these experiences are still fragmented and immature, and need to be systematically summarized and improved. In addition, meteorological service work for pig raising has not been fully launched. Some areas are doing better, while others have not yet taken action. In order to make meteorological work better serve the pig raising industry, adapt to the needs of various regions and various pig breeds, and make the service work more meticulous and solid, the following three tasks should be focused on at present:

First, establish and improve the meteorological service network for live pigs. That is to take the national meteorological observatories and stations as the backbone, and the commune meteorological outposts and groups as the basis, and generally establish meteorological outposts and meteorological groups in animal husbandry farms and teams. In the process of establishment and rectification, all localities should first pay attention to occupying as little or as little labor force as possible, and should implement the principles of voluntary, self-built, self-managed, and self-use. Personnel should generally hold concurrent posts and not be separated from production. They are both feeders and meteorologists, and achieve a combination of veterinarians, feeding, and meteorology, so that meteorological service work becomes an indispensable part of scientific feeding management.

Second, vigorously carry out investigation and research work. The experience accumulated by the farmers and the masses cannot be found or heard in books or classrooms. Seriously summarizing these experiences is of great importance to the development and enrichment of China's animal husbandry meteorological cause. For this reason, we must go deep into the front line of agricultural production, eat, live, work, and discuss with the farmers and the masses, and find out the laws of what meteorological conditions pigs "need and fear." The more specific and practical these laws are, the better they can meet the needs of the pig raising industry.

Third, in order to make meteorological service work better, experimental research work should also be actively carried out. For this reason, the changes in temperature and humidity and the growth and development of pigs should be observed regularly in the pigsty. Observe under what temperature and humidity conditions it is beneficial or unfavorable to the growth and development of pigs. In this way, we can not only verify the experience from the masses, but also further summarize and improve it. By repeatedly verifying and constantly supplementing, we can better grasp the weather laws of pig growth. In order to create an environment suitable for pig growth and development, it is necessary to strengthen the control of the pigsty climate. The construction of pigsties generally requires "warm in winter and cool in summer, ventilated and dry, and sufficient sunshine." These requirements change with the change of seasons. In the construction of pigsties, we must achieve the requirements of saving investment, maintaining comfort, and cooling and preventing heatstroke, preventing cold and increasing temperature. In addition, we must also widely carry out experimental research on various cold and heatstroke prevention measures according to the different situations in various regions, so as to take effective measures in a timely manner in combination with the evolution of the weather, control the climate of the pigsty, and benefit the growth and development of pigs.

    做好养猪的气象服务工作
    中央气象局副局长　饶兴
    地球上的一切生物，都生活在大气“海洋”的底部。各种生物在其生长发育的全部过程中，都受着气象条件的影响。认真研究各种农作物、牲畜、家禽等等与气象条件的关系，找出其“要什么、怕什么”气象条件的规律，以便通过人为的努力，充分利用和创造有利的气象条件，避免和防止不利的气象条件，是促进农业、畜牧业高速度发展的重要环节之一，也是气象部门的主要任务。
    猪是动物之一，当然也受着气象条件的影响。我国农民有数千年养猪的悠久历史，积累了丰富的经验。这些经验，集中成为许多的农谚。如：“梅雨纷纷落，仔猪病疫多”；“不怕阳光一大片，只怕贼风一条线”；“猪过一冬，一半落空”。湖南新化县农民养猪用气象的经验是：“小猪要游，大猪要囚。猪往草里拨，长毛肉不多。冷天生猪崽，栏内要烧火；热天生猪崽，栏内通风过，食要按时料要足，栏要朝南地要干。天气燥热疾病多，不冷不热最适合。”这些谚语科学地说明了养猪业与气象条件的关系。
    我国的养猪事业，自中央提出大养其猪的号召之后，有了飞速的发展。饲料基地已纷纷建立；在饲养管理方面也取得了一些经验；一支专业的养猪队伍已经基本形成。所有这些，都为大规模发展养猪事业奠定了良好的基础。但目前还存在某些问题。如某些地区仔猪成活率不高，增膘较慢，疾病传染较多，产生这些问题的原因很多。经过我们调查研究和实践证明，不善于掌握和控制气候条件，是影响猪的正常生长发育，以至生猪死亡的主要原因之一。
    影响猪的正常生长发育的气象因素，主要是外界天气的突然变化，促使猪舍内的温度、湿度发生剧变。这时，如果猪舍的温、湿度不是由人工控制，就将随着外界天气变化而变化；如果猪舍构造能御寒防暑，人们又能充分掌握猪对气象条件要求的规律，就可以按照未来天气变化的情况，对猪舍内的温、湿度进行控制，调节适宜猪生长发育的环境。猪舍内的温度条件适宜，猪的新陈代谢作用正常，精神饱满，食欲增加，即使饲料略粗，也能很快增膘，同时，因为身强力壮，还能抗寒、抗热、抗病。如果温度过高、过低，猪体内新陈代谢作用就不正常，猪的精神欠佳，食欲不振，即使喂精饲料也增膘不快，或掉膘，而且因为体弱身衰，容易受寒中暑，甚至死亡。湿度主要关系着猪体内水分的蒸发，而水分的蒸发又影响着猪体热量的散发。因此，湿度和温度是互为条件，互相影响的。特别是秋末冬初和冬末春初，温、湿度骤升骤降，变化剧烈，如果不加以防护和调节，猪就不易适应。这种现象主要发生在冷暖交替季节和寒潮侵袭时期。至于生猪调运，气候的适应与否，也是一个重要的问题。生猪都习惯于本地的气候条件，一旦在运输途中遇到骤冷骤热和异地气候的不同，常易致病。此外，气象条件对生猪还有一些间接的影响。例如，引起生猪发生流行病的病菌或寄生虫之类，它在气象条件适宜的时候，就容易繁殖和传播，使生猪染病。由此可见，温度和湿度对生猪的饲养管理有极为重要的影响。
    一般说来，适宜于猪生长发育的温度在摄氏十度到二十五度之间，相对湿度在40％—75％。但是，猪对气象条件的要求，是因地、因时、因品种、因气候、因生长发育阶段、因设备和饲养管理水平的不同而不同的。根据各地气象部门的研究，在内蒙古赤峰一带，温度摄氏十度到十二度、相对湿度30％—40％左右，最有利于猪的生长发育；而在湖南郴州一带，则以温度摄氏二十度到二十四度、相对湿度75％左右为最适宜，两者相差很多。即使在同一地区，如果季节不同，其适应的温、湿度条件也有不同。根据山东莒南县板泉人民公社的材料，母猪和仔猪，秋季以摄氏十度到十五度为宜，春季则以摄氏十五度到十八度为宜。不仅如此，处在不同生长发育阶段的生猪，对温、湿度的要求也不同。浙江义乌县二十三里公社实验证明：仔猪和母猪，以温度十五度到二十二度、相对湿度65％—75％为宜，而肥猪以温度摄氏十二度到二十度、相对湿度70％—80％为宜。因此，要使气象服务工作适应这种错综复杂的要求，必须加强调查研究，要靠当地群众、畜牧业生产部门和气象部门共同努力。
    创造适合于猪生长发育的猪舍小气候是一个值得重视的问题。由于猪舍具有防风雨、保温等等作用，所以猪舍内的温度、湿度、光照、风、雨等气象条件都和自然界有所不同。在猪舍内部各个部分，各种气象要素也有很大差异。例如猪舍内不同高度之间，向阳和背阴处之间，温度和湿度等气象要素都有很大差异。而不同设计的猪舍，其小气候特点又各有不同。湖南新化县天龙山农场1958年建场之初，由于没有掌握气候变化，再加缺乏饲养管理经验，猪受灾害性天气影响很大，死亡率较高。1959年4月新化县气象服务站和气象学会，在场党委亲自领导下，对猪舍进行了温、湿度变化的观测，开展了群众气象服务工作，结果，猪的死亡率降低到0.13％，发病率降低到3.4％，仔猪成活率提高到97％，全场基本上实现“六无”（无猪瘟、无丹毒、无肺炎、无流产、无空怀、无仔猪死亡）。
    气象条件不仅对生猪的生长发育有重要的影响，对于猪的繁殖、采精、配种、满怀、保胎、产仔等以及疫病的发生和流行，均有着密切的关系。正确地掌握了这些规律，就可以使猪繁殖快、得病少。猪的人工受精，根据已有指标，不宜在阴雨天进行，而应选择在天气晴朗、温度摄氏十度到二十度左右时进行。同时人工受精器的聚精杯的温度宜保持在摄氏二十五度左右，以便延长精子寿命。河南南阳英庄人民公社万头猪场根据上述指标，用一号乌克兰猪和本地母猪杂交，结果一胎产仔二十一头，比阴天发情配种的一头母猪多生了十五头，提高繁殖率两倍多。在猪的发病和治疗方面，气象条件也起着重要的作用。新化县天龙山农场今年2月有两头猪生病，全身瘫痪，不能行走，经五十七天的治疗无效。后经气象员与畜牧技术员共同调查研究，才弄清是由于长期低温、湿度大而得的风湿症。后将这两头猪抬到另一个地区饲养，改变了气象条件，猪舍温度经常保持在摄氏十度到二十度左右，相对湿度在72％—78％，晴天打开窗户，寒潮来了生火加垫草，堵风洞，饲养上稍加精料，结果只经过三十七天时间，两头猪就完全恢复健康，病愈后四个多月，平均每月增长二十多斤。群众称赞说：“气象准，气象灵，不用药，不打针，利用气象治猪病。”
    虽然，在养猪气象服务方面，各地已经积累了一些经验，但是目前这些经验还是零碎的、片断的，而且还不成熟，需要系统地总结和提高。此外，养猪气象服务工作尚未全面展开，有的地区做得好些，有的地区则还未行动起来。为了使气象工作更好地为养猪业服务，适应各个地区和各种不同猪的品种的需要，把服务工作做得更加细致和扎实，当前，应注意抓好以下三件工作：
    第一，建立和健全生猪气象服务网。这就是要以国家气象台、站为骨干，以公社气象哨、组为基础，在畜牧饲养场、队中普遍建立起气象哨、气象组。各地在建立和整顿过程中，首先要注意尽可能不占用或少占用劳动力，应该贯彻自愿、自建、自管、自用的原则，人员一般兼职、不脱离生产，既是饲养员，又是气象员，做到兽医、饲养、气象三结合，使气象服务工作成为科学的饲养管理不可缺少的一个组成部分。
    第二，大力开展调查研究工作。农民群众所积累的经验，书本上课堂内是找不到听不到的。认真地总结这些经验，对发展和丰富我国畜牧气象事业有着重要的作用。为此，我们必须深入农业生产第一线，同农民群众同吃同住同劳动同商量，找出猪“要什么、怕什么”气象条件的规律。这些规律，找得愈具体，愈切合实际，就愈能适应养猪事业的需要。
    第三，为了使气象服务工作做得更好，还应积极地进行试验研究工作。为此，应定时地在猪舍内观测温度、湿度的变化以及猪的生长发育状况。观测在什么样的温、湿度条件下，对猪的生长发育有利或不利。这样，既可以验证从群众中来的经验，又可以进一步加以总结提高，如此反复验证，不断补充，就可更好地掌握生猪生长的天气规律。为了能创造出适宜于猪生长发育的环境，必须加强对猪舍气候的控制。猪舍的建筑，一般要求“冬暖夏凉、通风干燥、阳光充足”。这些要求，随着季节的变化而变化。在猪舍的建筑上，要做到既能达到节省投资，保持舒适，又能降温防暑、防寒增温的要求。此外，还要根据各地区的不同情况，广泛开展有关防寒防暑各种措施的试验研究，以便结合天气演变的情况，适时地采取有效措施，控制猪舍的气候，以利于猪的生长发育。
