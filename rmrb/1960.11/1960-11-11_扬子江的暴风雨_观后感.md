Thoughts on "Storm on the Yangtze"
    Wang Jin
    Coming out of the theater, I was deeply moved, and I also heard the audience's moved discussions. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude and praise to the comrades of the Central Experimental Opera Troupe. They have put in creative labor for the performance of this work, so that this work can reappear on the stage twenty-five years after its first performance. After such a long period, it is indeed not an easy task to faithfully convey the life, the atmosphere of the era, and even the artistic style of the time, so that the audience is infected. Here we see that the comrades who participated in the performance have successfully completed this task, and in many aspects have further developed and developed the spirit of the original work. For example, in terms of music, Comrade Mao Yuan's musical composition based on Nie Er's original work (which Nie Er did not have time to complete before his death) makes the original image more vivid and more unified, which is worthy of our praise.
    Through this invaluable performance, the work takes us back to the reality of more than twenty years ago. That was the era when the Chinese people were weighed down by the three great mountains, and the disasters were extremely profound. Imperialists, national traitors, and secret agents and running dogs ran rampant, killing people like hemp, and implementing high-pressure and terror rule; on the other hand, the revolutionary ranks led by the Party, the awakened workers, peasants and intellectuals were carrying out heroic and tenacious struggles. Thus, against the backdrop of the Bund, a thrilling picture of struggle was unfolded for us. Here are dock workers, textile factory girls, newspaper-selling children, revolutionary youth... They fought against the Japanese aggressors and Kuomintang secret agents with wisdom, courage and spirit of sacrifice. Under the enemy's bullets, the soldiers fell, but the people resolutely refused to yield, embraced the dead, linked their arms, and stood up with their chests, singing loudly to the enemy, "We are not afraid of death, don't use death to scare us! We will not be slaves of a conquered nation, we want to be the masters of China!"... From these strong and confident verses and the sonorous and turbulent tones, we see the coming of a storm, and we see the victorious future and bright prospects of the Chinese nation in the struggle.
    The scenes of struggle depicted by Comrade Tian Han in this work are unforgettable, especially with the addition of Nie Er's development in musical imagery, which makes the work have a stronger infectious power. Comrades who have seen this opera have a common feeling that although the era reflected in the work has passed, it is still very kind today and evokes strong resonance. This is understandable, because although we live in a happy today, we have never forgotten the suffering of yesterday, nor have we forgotten those revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who followed one after another. And when we see these realistic images, which have been greatly artistically generalized, reappearing on the stage, we cannot suppress this full of excitement. On the other hand, although we have entered the era of socialist construction, our territory of Taiwan is still under the trampling of imperialism and reactionaries, and the people there are still living the life reflected in this work twenty-five years ago. And from a global perspective, two-thirds of the world's population has not yet been liberated. Therefore, this opera still has a strong practical significance today. This opera, as well as the excellent works of Nie Er and other pioneers, whether as a valuable heritage of revolutionary music tradition, or as a realistic reflection of the world historical stage in which imperialism is heading towards extinction and the proletariat is carrying out revolution, are worthy of our continued promotion and dissemination, to encourage us to bury our heads in hard work, to inspire us to continue to leap forward, and to educate the younger generation.
    Finally, a conclusion can also be drawn from this opera to refute the distortions of Nie Er's works by some people in the past. They said that Nie Er was nothing great, but wrote twenty or thirty "tunes", the implication being that Nie Er's works were monotonous in style and poor in technique. Here, let's not talk about the great founding role of Nie Er's dozens of songs in proletarian music and art, let's not talk about his genius creation and profound image portrayal of the new national musical language in these songs, and let's not even talk about the distinctiveness of style originality he showed in each song... Just the interest and attempts he made in various musical genres during his short years of musical creation are enough to prove that those distortions and contempt for him are completely absurd. In addition to writing fighting songs, Nie Er also engaged in the creation and adaptation of instrumental music, "Dance of the Golden Snake" is a well-known example. From "Storm on the Yangtze", we can see his emphasis on opera, and he left us with a good start. If Heaven had granted him more years, we believe he would have left us with more valuable heritage in this regard. Of course, if viewed from the standard of traditional European opera, this work will inevitably be degraded to "spoken drama plus singing". But we cannot agree with this dogmatic view of blindly worshiping foreigners. This opera, in order to quickly reflect the revolutionary situation of that era and achieve the political effect of propaganda and mobilization in a timely manner, adopted this form of expression, which should be said to be a creation, a glorious tradition worthy of our inheritance and promotion. It is not to say that it is already impeccable in artistry, but that strong political feeling, profound and distinct images, and the expressive forms full of combativeness and mass character, are the first things that are worth our learning well. Especially in the creation of new opera, we should affirm that this kind of opera is a style in our new tradition, a very characteristic form of expression.

    “扬子江的暴风雨”观后感
    王晋
    从剧场走出来，心中怀着深深的激动，同时也听到观众被感动的纷纷议论。这里首先是对中央实验歌剧院同志们的感激和赞扬。他们为了这部作品的演出，付出了创造性的劳动，使得这部作品能够在第一次演出的二十五年之后，重新出现在舞台上。经过这样的长时期，今天要把当时的生活、时代气氛，甚至艺术风格忠实地传达出来，使观众受到感染，的确不是一件容易的事情。这里我们看到参加演出工作的同志们胜利地完成了这个任务，而且在许多方面是更进一步发挥和发展了原作的精神。例如在音乐方面，茅沅同志根据聂耳原作进行的音乐构成（这是聂耳生前没有来得及完成的），使得原有形象更为鲜明，更为统一，这都是值得我们称赞的。
    通过这个难能可贵的演出，作品把我们带到二十多年前的现实环境中去了。那正是中国人民头上压着三座大山，灾难异常深重的年代，帝国主义、国贼汉奸、特务走狗横行无阻，杀人如麻，执行高压和恐怖统治；另一方面党所领导的革命队伍，觉悟了的工农和知识分子在进行英勇顽强的斗争，这样，就在黄浦滩头的背景上，给我们展开了一幅惊心动魄的斗争画面。这里有码头工人、纱厂女工、卖报儿童、革命青年……他们以智慧和勇敢牺牲精神向日本侵略者和国民党特务展开斗争，在敌人枪弹下，战士倒下去了，但人们坚决不屈，抱起死者，挽着臂膀，挺起胸膛，对着敌人高声唱起“我们并不怕死，不要拿死来吓我们！我们不做亡国奴，我们要做中国的主人！”……从这坚强自信的诗句和铿锵激荡的音调中，使我们看到了一场暴风雨的行将到来，使我们看到中华民族在斗争中的胜利前途和光明的远景。
    田汉同志在这部作品中所描绘的斗争场面是令人难以忘怀的，特别是加上了聂耳在音乐形象上的发挥，使得作品具有更强烈的感染力量。看过这个歌剧的同志都有一种共同的感受，觉得虽然作品所反映的时代已经过去了，但是今天看来还是非常亲切，引起强烈的共鸣。这是可以理解的，因为我们虽然生活在幸福的今天，但从未忘记苦难的昨天，从未忘记那些前仆后继的先烈和战士，而当我们看到经过巨大艺术概括的这些现实形象在舞台上再现时，就无法按捺这满腔激动了另一方面，我们虽然已经进入社会主义建设的时代，但我国的领土台湾还在帝国主义和反动派蹂躏下，那里的人民还过着这部二十五年前的作品所反映的生活，而从世界范围来看，人类还有三分之二的人口没有解放，因此，这部歌剧在今天还是有强烈的现实意义的。这部歌剧，以及聂耳和其他先行者们的优秀作品，不论是作为革命音乐传统的宝贵遗产，或者是作为在帝国主义走向灭亡、无产阶级进行革命的世界历史阶段的现实反映，都值得我们继续推广、传播，用以策励我们埋头苦干，用以鼓舞我们持续跃进和教育青年一代。
    最后，从这部歌剧也可以得出结论来驳斥过去某些人对聂耳作品的歪曲。他们说，聂耳没什么了不起，不过写了二三十个“调调儿”，言下之意，无非是说聂耳作品风格单调，技巧贫乏。这里我们且不说聂耳的几十首歌曲在无产阶级音乐艺术上的伟大奠基作用，且不说他在这些歌曲中对新的民族音乐语言的天才创造和深刻的形象刻划，甚至也不说他在每一首歌曲中所表现的各不相同的风格独创性……单就他在短短几年的音乐创作活动中对于各种音乐体裁的兴趣和尝试来说，也足以证明那些对他的歪曲和轻蔑完全是荒诞无稽的。聂耳除了写战斗性的歌曲以外，还从事器乐的创作与改编，《金蛇狂舞》是大家熟知的例子。从《扬子江的暴风雨》更可以看到他对歌剧的重视，而且给我们留下了一个良好的开端。天如假年，我们相信他会在这方面给我们留下更多的宝贵遗产的。当然，如果从传统欧洲歌剧的标准来看，这部作品免不了又要被贬为“话剧加唱”。但我们是不能同意这种一味崇洋的教条主义观点的。这部歌剧，为了迅速反映那个时代的革命形势，及时取得宣传鼓动的政治效果，而采用了这种表现形式，应该说是一种创造，一种值得我们继承和发扬的光荣传统。并不是说它在艺术性上已经无可非议了，但那种强烈的政治感情，深刻而鲜明的形象，富于战斗性和群众性的表现形式，是首先值得我们好好学习的。特别在新歌剧的创作上，我们应该肯定这种歌剧是我们新的传统中的一种风格，一种很有特点的表现形式。
