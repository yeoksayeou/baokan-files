The Crucible of Labor Has Tempered Me
Wang Peizhen, Commune Member of Tuanbowa People's Commune, Jinghai County, Tianjin, Hebei

My three years in Tuanbowa have truly made me realize that the countryside is a great place to temper educated youth. Looking back to 1957 when the Party called on educated youth to go to the countryside to become conscious and cultured farmers for the motherland, my father and mother said that I was "wasting my talent" by going to the countryside to be a farmer, that I had no future, and that I was simply a fool. I thought to myself that I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and the needs of the Party are my aspirations. The construction of a new countryside will always require pioneers, and I cannot simply not work and enjoy the fruits of others' labor. I must wholeheartedly devote myself to communism. Finally, I left the bustling Tianjin and my warm home, and came to Tuanbowa to become a farmer.

When I first arrived in the countryside, Comrade Hao Fuzong, the District Party Secretary, introduced us to the past conditions and future development prospects of Tuanbowa. In the past, Tuanbowa was a vast expanse of saline land where crops could not grow, a huge pool of bitter water. After liberation, the Party led the peasants to transform the low-lying land, building pumping stations, so that the bitter water that had existed for thousands of years returned to the sea, and sweet water was used for irrigation, turning barren land into endless rice paddies. Thinking that my hometown would completely transform into a land of fish, rice, flowers, and fruits, I was greatly encouraged.

At first, the villagers couldn't see through me, thinking that I "wouldn't last long, couldn't bear the hardship, and would leave in the future." Hearing this, I secretly made up my mind to dispel their doubts about me with practical actions.

On the first day of harvesting rice, I was so tired that my back ached and my legs were sore, and I couldn't hold the sickle handle. At this time, I remembered the school leaders' instructions and my own promises when I left, and I thought of the older generation of revolutionaries who were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice to bring us happy days. Now, the construction of the motherland requires me to sweat a little and suffer a little. What does that count for? So, I encouraged myself to persevere no matter how great the difficulties, and never be a deserter.

As time went on, I slowly got used to the life, and I didn't feel so tired from work. I could even do some of the work that many male laborers could do. Through labor, my thoughts and feelings underwent great changes. When I was in school in Tianjin, I would cover my nose and pass by when I saw a manure cart on the road. Coming to the countryside, my feelings changed through actual labor. I truly understood the saying of the peasants: "Growing crops without manure is like aimlessly muddling along." Realizing that there would be no food without manure, I treated manure like treasure when I saw it. I became a farmer, participated in labor, saw a scene of abundant harvest, and thought that there was a part of my strength in the fruits of labor. I was infinitely happy in my heart and deeply realized that labor creates everything, that the working people are the greatest, and that it is very glorious for me to be a farmer.

Labor, this crucible, has tempered me, constantly improved my ideological understanding, and made me a glorious member of the Chinese Communist Party in the countryside. Labor has closely linked me with the peasants. The peasants have taught me a lot of production knowledge. I am willing to be a farmer forever and build a happy and beautiful rural people's commune together with the peasants.

In the countryside, I deeply felt that my knowledge was not enough. In order to study methods for increasing rice production, the Party committee assigned me the task of leading the youth to manage experimental fields. In sixty-four mu of land, we conducted comparisons of twenty-three varieties and more than thirty different plantings, irrigations, and fertilizations. Because of our continuous research and summary, each mu of rice field yielded eight hundred catties. However, there are still many complex problems that need to be solved, such as how to prevent rice lodging, reclaim wasteland, and so on. These many glorious and arduous tasks need to be scientifically researched.

After the establishment of the People's Commune, our commune established tractor stations, machinery factories, rice and flour processing plants, kiln factories, salt factories..., and more factories will be built in the future. The more rural construction develops, the more educated youth are needed to play a role. Educated youth from Tianjin in our commune have played a huge role in all walks of life in the countryside. Everyone has grown up in labor and become excellent drivers, people's teachers, agricultural technicians, electricians, accountants, doctors.... I have come to realize that as long as we establish the ambition to build a rural people's commune, resolutely listen to the Party, and are willing to let knowledge play its role in the countryside, as long as we are willing to work hard, educated youth can contribute to the Party and the people in the countryside. This is the greatest future for educated youth.

The future of the countryside is infinitely bright. The Party and the people have increasingly high demands on us rural educated youth. The Party has put forward the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation, calling on us to run agriculture and grain production in a big way. I feel that as a rural educated youth, my responsibility is even greater. Since February of last year, I have joined the Party, and the sense of responsibility of a Party member has strengthened my driving force to move forward. Obeying the needs of the Party, striving for communism to the end, and running agriculture well is my greatest happiness and joy. [Zhang Luan Illustration] (Attached picture)

### 劳动熔炉锻炼了我

    劳动熔炉锻炼了我
    河北天津静海县团泊洼人民公社社员　　王培珍
    我在团泊洼三年，真正体会到农村是锻炼知识青年的好地方。回想起1957年党号召知识青年到农村作祖国有觉悟、有文化的农民时，父亲母亲说我下乡当农民“屈才”，没有前途，简直是个傻子。我想我是个共青团员，党的需要就是我的志愿。建设新农村总要有打头阵的，我不能不劳动而去享受别人的劳动成果，要一个心眼地为了共产主义。我终于离开了繁华的天津和温暖的家庭，来到了团泊洼当了农民。
    初到农村，区委书记郝福宗同志就向我们介绍了团泊洼的过去情况和将来发展远景。过去团泊洼一望白花花，禾苗不生长，苦水一大洼。看到解放后党领导农民进行洼地改造，修起了扬水站，使几千年的苦水归大海，用甜水来灌溉，使荒草野地变成一眼望不到边的稻田。想到将来我的家乡就要完全变成一个鱼米花果之乡，我便受到莫大的鼓舞。
    起初，乡亲们看不透我，认为我“兔子尾巴长不了，受不了这个苦，将来会走的。”听到这些，我暗暗下定决心，一定用实际行动来解除他们对我的疑虑。
    头一天割稻子累得腰酸腿疼，手拿不住镰把，这时我想起临走时学校领导上的嘱咐、自己的保证，想起革命老前辈不怕流血牺牲给我们换来幸福的日子。现在建设祖国需要我流点汗，受点累，又算得了什么呢？于是我便鼓励自己再有多大的困难也要坚持下去，绝不做逃兵。
    时间长了，生活慢慢习惯了，干活也不觉得累了，不少男劳力的活也能干了。通过劳动使我的思想感情发生了很大的变化。我在天津上学时在马路上看见粪车就掩鼻而过，来到农村通过实际劳动，使我感情发生了转变，我真正体会到农民说的“种地不上粪、等于瞎胡混”这句话。认识到没有粪就没有粮食，于是见了粪就像见了宝一样。我当了农民，参加了劳动，看到一片丰收的景象，想到劳动成果中有我的一份力量，心中无限高兴，深深体会到劳动创造一切，劳动人民是最伟大的，我当个农民是非常光荣的。
    劳动这个熔炉锻炼了我，使我的思想觉悟不断有了提高，使我在农村成为一个光荣的中国共产党党员。劳动使我和农民紧紧地连在一起。农民教给了我许多生产知识，我愿意永远作一个农民，同农民一起建设幸福美好的农村人民公社。
    在农村我深切地感到知识不够用。为了研究增产水稻的方法，党委交给了我带领青年搞试验田的任务，我们在六十四亩地里搞了二十三种品种的对比和三十多种不同种植、灌水、施肥的对比，由于我们不断地研究总结，使每亩稻田获得了八百斤的产量。但是，还有许多复杂的问题需要我们去解决，像如何防止水稻倒伏、开垦荒地等等。这许多光荣而艰巨的任务都需要去进行科学研究。
    人民公社成立以后，我们公社建立了拖拉机站、机械厂、米面加工厂、窑厂、盐厂……，将来还要建立更多的工厂，农村建设越发展越需要知识青年发挥作用。我们公社来自天津的知识青年，在农村中的各行各业中都发挥了巨大作用，大家在劳动中成长起来，成为优秀的驾驶员、人民教师、农业技术员、电工、会计、医生……。我体会到只要树立建设农村人民公社的雄心壮志，坚决听党的话，愿意让知识在农村中发挥它的作用，只要自己肯干，知识青年在农村可以为党为人民作出贡献，这就是知识青年的最大前途。
    农村的前景是无限美好的。党和人民对我们农村知识青年的要求也越来越高。党提出了发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针，号召我们大办农业大办粮食，我感到作为一个农村知识青年责任更重大了。从去年2月起，我已经参加了党，一个党员的责任感更增强了我前进的力量。服从党的需要，为共产主义奋斗到底，办好农业，这是我最大的幸福和快乐。〔张鸾插图〕（附图片）
