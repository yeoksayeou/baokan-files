    Open More Tool Rental Shops
    The method mentioned in the article "Tool Workshops Outside the Factory" published in the People's Daily Industrial Edition on October 11th is very good. In fact, it is difficult for a small factory to have all the tools it needs. If every industrial city could establish several hardware tool rental shops like Shanghai, it would play a significant role in saving funds and promoting production.

    多办工具出租店
    十月十一日人民日报工业版刊载的“厂外的‘工具车间’”一文，所说的办法很好。事实上，一个小厂子很难做到所有工具应有尽有。如果每个工业城市都能像上海那样，办几个五金工具出租商店，对节约资金和促进生产将起不小作用。
