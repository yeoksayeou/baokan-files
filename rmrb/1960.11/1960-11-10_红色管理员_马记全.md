    Red Administrator – Ma Jiquan
    Tang Qizhang
    Ma Jiquan, the administrator of the No. 1 canteen of the Changgucheng Production Team in Renhouzhen Commune, Tang County, Hebei Province, is a 25-year-old Communist Party member. For two years, under the leadership of the Party branch and relying on the masses, he has resolutely implemented the Party's policies and achieved outstanding results in this important socialist position, earning the love of the commune members. Since January 1959, when the team implemented a system of electing administrators and cooks by the masses every quarter, Ma Jiquan has received a unanimous vote each time. The masses call him a "Red Administrator," and the Tang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has called on all administrators and cooks in the county to learn from him.
          “I Will Definitely Do a Good Job!”
    At first, when Ma Jiquan heard the Party branch suggest that he serve as the administrator, he thought, "The eating and drinking of hundreds of people are to be handled by me. This is no simple matter. Can I do it?"
    The branch secretary said to him with great certainty: "You can do it! We are Party members. If we don't do it, who will! The canteen is an important socialist position. We must not only do it, but do it well!" Ma Jiquan pondered these words, determined to take on this burden!
            The Masses Are the Backing
    When the canteen was first established, there was a lack of experience, and the commune members inevitably raised some opinions. Ma Jiquan made many improvements based on the opinions of the masses; but sometimes he was a little impatient, thinking, "A hundred people have a hundred tastes, and there's no end to listening to everyone." The Party branch noticed this problem and asked Deputy Secretary Ma Qiuzi to specifically help the canteen. Qiuzi told him: "Managing the lives of these three hundred people cannot rely on just one or two of us. Don't forget that the public is always right!" He thought: That's right! Relying only on me, Ma Jiquan, I can't cover the sky with my hands. Only by mobilizing everyone can the eating of these three hundred people be managed well.
    Relying on the masses, the work of the canteen quickly changed. Under the leadership of the branch, thirteen representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants were democratically elected to form a canteen management committee. They held meetings on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month to study the work of the canteen. Jiquan did everything possible to ensure that the matters resolved at each meeting were implemented. Jiquan sorted out the opinions of the masses reflected by the committee members one by one. What could be done was done immediately, and everything that could not be done had a resolution. The masses put forward many valuable suggestions for running the canteen well. For example, commune member Ma Laoqing suggested: Making fresh sweet potatoes into starch can be used as both dry food and soup, which is convenient to store and saves grain. Jiquan adopted this method, and more than three hundred people could save fourteen catties of grain in one meal. The commune members also made many suggestions for storing fresh vegetables and improving canteen hygiene, all of which Jiquan handled as needed.
    These facts made Jiquan realize even more that the masses are the backing for running the canteen well. Therefore, Jiquan sought the opinions of the masses through various forms. At meal times, he walked around the dining hall, sitting here and chatting for a while, and going there to ask a question; every day before dinner, when the canteen was relatively idle, Jiquan went to the homes of sick commune members to ask what they needed from the canteen; sometimes he also went to the livestock farm, pig farm, and vegetable garden to solicit opinions from all aspects on the canteen. Once, he delivered food to the sweet potato field south of the village and found that four commune members had diarrhea. They said, "It's hot working, and we like to drink cold water, so our stomachs have a little problem." Jiquan listened and secretly blamed himself. From that day on, he sent loads of boiled water to the fields for the commune members. Jiquan established two notebooks in the canteen courtyard: one for suggestions on saving food rations and one for opinions on canteen management; and there were also three platforms, namely, a suggestion platform, a question-and-answer platform, and a criticism and commendation platform. Commune members could raise their opinions on the canteen at any time. In two months, more than 210 suggestions from the masses were received. In this way, Jiquan improved the canteen work in a timely manner based on the opinions of the masses.
    Jiquan was even more concerned about the commune members. He knew exactly who liked to eat thin porridge, who liked to eat thick porridge, who liked to eat sour food, who liked to eat sweet food, and who had a big or small appetite. If someone ate half a pancake less, he would go up and ask, "What's wrong? Are you not feeling well? Or is the food not good?" Once, commune member Jia Xile didn't buy vegetables to eat, so he went to inquire and found out that Xile didn't like to eat radishes. Jiquan also made a statistics of these things, registering who didn't like to eat what since childhood, or who was temporarily avoiding certain foods for some reason, and tried to take care of them as much as possible. Therefore, the commune members all said that the canteen was a "wish-fulfilling hall" and the food was "satisfactory food."
              Grow Vegetables to Improve Life
    This canteen truly achieved three meals a day, with both porridge and dry food, and no repetitive meals for three days. If you ask Ma Jiquan why he has adjusted life so well? He will tell you: "The main reason is that we grow more vegetables and develop domestic production." In the past, the village of Changgucheng had no habit of growing vegetables, and the masses spread the saying: "The land is sandy, the well water is three feet deep, and vegetables don't grow." Jiquan didn't see it that way. As soon as he became the administrator, he actively grew vegetables.
    At first, some commune members said to Jiquan, "Ask your grandfather, when has our village ever grown vegetables? You young people are just messing around." But Jiquan thought: No matter what, it won't work to rely on buying vegetables. With the support of the Party branch, he selected three careful commune members, including Ma Shanzhong, to "study" at the Yuanzi Production Team, which had the most experience in growing vegetables nearby. They listened in detail to the experience introduced by others and carefully observed the vegetables they grew, and they felt very eager to try. Why is it that only a few miles away, with the same soil, other people's vegetables are so strong? When they returned to the canteen, they leveled the land together and planted radishes and pumpkins. Whenever Jiquan had time, he went to the vegetable garden to water, kill insects, and pull weeds. Who would have thought that the pumpkin vines would not bear fruit even after they stretched more than two feet long. Jiquan ran to the Yuanzi Team several times to ask and learned the techniques of managing pumpkins. The pumpkins were harvested in abundance, with more than 16,000 catties harvested. With pumpkins, cornmeal porridge became thick and sweet pumpkin porridge. The food was well adjusted, and the commune members were extremely happy!
            Is an Administrator and a Cook
    The No. 1 canteen of the Changgucheng Production Team is run so well, but there are not many cooks. People say that Jiquan is a good administrator and also a good cook. The cooks say that if Jiquan were missing, we would have to add two more people. Ma Jiquan, like the cooks, carries water, turns the blower, pushes the cart to deliver food, and he is always at the forefront in every heavy task. Through participating in labor, he discovered many problems and also greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the cooks, making the canteen better and better.
    From the moment the canteen was established, he took on the heaviest physical work in the canteen - carrying water. Every morning, before the cooks had arrived, Jiquan filled the water tank and the four large pots. The cooks rushed to do it, but Jiquan wouldn't let them, saying, "I'm young and strong, and I'll get stronger the more I use it." The cooks were very moved and came to the canteen early in the morning, before the window paper had turned white, to prepare the meal early. The commune members said that the cooks were tired enough, getting up early and going to bed late every day. But the cooks said: "The most tired is still our administrator."
    Jiquan pondered things while carrying water. In May of this year, he personally created a bamboo pipe self-flowing water system. From then on, he no longer carried water. With less effort in using water, the most laborious task in the canteen was turning the blower. This task was "seized" by Jiquan again.

    红色管理员——马记全
    唐其章
    河北唐县仁厚镇公社长古城生产队第一食堂的管理员，是个二十五岁的共产党员，名叫马记全。两年来，他在党支部的领导下，依靠群众，坚决贯彻执行党的政策，在这个社会主义的重要阵地上，干出了出色的成绩，受到了社员群众的爱戴。从1959年1月这个队实行每季度由群众选举一次管理员、炊事员的制度以来，马记全每次都得全票。群众称他是“红色管理员”，中共唐县号召全县的管理员、炊事员向他学习。
          “一　定　干　好！”
    开始，马记全听到党支部建议由他担任管理员的时候，也曾想过：“几百口子人的吃喝都由我操办，这可不是个简单事。我干得了吗？”
    支部书记十分肯定地对他说：“干得了！咱是党员，咱不干，谁干！食堂是社会主义的重要阵地，咱不光要干，还要干好！”马记全琢磨着这些话，决心要把这付担子担起来！
            群　众　是　靠　山
    乍办食堂，缺少经验，社员短不了提些意见。马记全根据群众的意见，做了不少的改进；可是有时也有些不耐烦，他想“百人吃百味，净听大家的没个完”。党支部发觉了这个问题，就让副支书马秋子具体帮助这个食堂。秋子告诉他：“管好这三百多口人的生活，靠咱一两个人可不行，不要忘记众人是圣人哪！” 他想：可不是！光凭我马记全，手大遮不过天，只有把大伙发动起来，这三百多口人吃饭的事情才能管好。
    依靠了群众，食堂的工作很快变了样。在支部的领导下，民主选出了十三个贫农、下中农社员代表，组成了食堂管理委员会，每月初一、十一、二十一开会研究食堂工作，每次会议上决议的事项，记全尽一切努力保证实现。对委员们反映的群众的意见，记全一一排队，可以办的马上就办，不能办的，件件都有着落。群众提出了许许多多办好食堂的宝贵意见，例如社员马老庆提出：把鲜甘薯制成淀粉，既能做干粮又能做粉汤，保管方便，节省粮食。记全采用了这个办法，三百多口人一顿就可节省十四斤粮食。社员们还提了许多储藏鲜菜、搞好食堂卫生的建议，记全都根据需要办了。
    这些事实使记全越发认识到群众是办好食堂的靠山。于是，记全通过多种形式征求群众的意见。吃饭的时候，他在饭厅里走来走去，一时坐在这里扯一扯，一时又到那里问一问；每天晚饭前，是食堂里比较清闲的时候，记全就到患病的社员家里转一转，问问对食堂有什么要求；有时他还到畜牧场、养猪场和菜园里，征求各方面对食堂的意见。有一次，他送饭到村南甘薯地，发现四个社员拉肚子，他们说是：“干活热了，爱喝凉水，肚子出了点毛病。”记全听了，暗暗责备自己。从这天起，他就把一担担的开水，给社员送到地里。记全在食堂大院里建立了两个簿子：一个是口粮节省献计簿，一个是食堂管理意见簿；还有三个台，即献策献计台、问题解答台、批评表扬台。社员对食堂的意见，可以随时提出来。两个月中，就收到群众的建议二百一十多条。就这样，记全根据群众的意见，及时改进了食堂工作。
    记全对社员更是关心。谁爱吃稀的、谁爱吃稠的，谁爱吃酸的、谁爱吃甜的，以及谁的饭量大小，他都摸得透熟。谁一顿少吃半个饼子，他就上前问问。“怎么啦，身上不对劲儿？还是饭没做好？”有一次，社员贾喜乐没买菜吃，他便前去打听，原来是喜乐不爱吃萝卜。记全还把这些作了一番统计，谁从小就不爱吃什么东西，或是因为什么原因暂时忌口等等，都登记起来，尽量给以照顾。因此社员都说食堂是“随心堂”，饭是“如意饭”。
              大种蔬菜改善生活
    这个食堂真正做到了一天三餐，有稀有干，三天不吃重样饭。要问马记全为什么把生活调剂得这么好？他会告诉你：“主要是多种了蔬菜，发展了家底生产。”长古城这个村子，过去没有种菜的习惯，群众流传着：“地是黄沙地，井水三丈深，种菜不长菜。”记全不是这样看的，他一当管理员，就积极种菜。
    开始，有的社员向记全说：“问问你爷，咱村哪辈子种过菜？你这小青年净瞎闹。”但是，记全想：不管怎么说，靠买菜吃不行。他在党支部的支持下，选了马善忠等三个细心的社员，一块到附近种菜最有经验的园子生产队去“留学”。他们详细听了人家介绍的经验，仔细看了人家种的菜，心里挺痒痒。为什么只离几里地，同样的土质，人家的菜这么强？回到食堂，他们一起就把地打整得平平整整，种上了根达、南瓜，记全一有空就到菜园里浇水、除虫、拔草。谁想到，南瓜蔓伸到二尺多长还不结瓜。记全又跑到园子队问了几遍，学到了管理南瓜的技术。南瓜丰收了，收了一万六千多斤。有了南瓜，玉米面粥变成了又稠又甜的南瓜粥。饭菜调剂得好，社员们高兴极了！
            是管理员又是炊事员
    长古城生产队第一食堂办得这么好，炊事员并不多。人们说记全是个好管理员，又是个好炊事员。炊事员们说，要缺了记全，我们得再添两个人。马记全和炊事员一样，担水呀，拧鼓风机呀，推着小车子送饭呀，件件重活他都干在前头。通过参加劳动，发现了不少问题，同时也大大鼓舞了炊事员们的干劲，使食堂越办越好。
    从食堂一办起来，他就把食堂最重的力气活——担水包了起来。每天早晨，炊事员还没来齐，记全就把水缸和四口大锅添得满满的。炊事员们抢着干，记全不让，他说：“我年轻轻的，随身带着力气，使了还长。”炊事员们很受感动，早晨窗纸还没发白，就来到食堂，早早地把饭做停当了。社员们说炊事员够辛苦了，每天都起早睡晚。炊事员们却说：“最辛苦的还是咱管理员。”
    记全边担水，边琢磨事。今年5月，他亲自动手搞成了竹管土自流水。从此，再也不担水了。用水省力了，食堂里最费力的活计要算拧鼓风机。这个差事又被记全“抢占”了。
