    People are the Key to Running a Good Canteen
    Running a good canteen, like doing anything else, requires many conditions, but the most important thing is people, the cooks. It's about whether the culinary staff truly adheres to putting politics in command and establishes a mindset of wholeheartedly and enthusiastically serving production and the masses.
    The employee canteen is the organizer of the collective life of the employees. Whether an employee canteen is run well or not not only affects the daily life of the employees and their vital interests such as physical health, but also directly affects production and socialist construction. Regarding culinary work as the most glorious has significant political meaning. This way, work will be active and proactive, and even if the conditions are poor, the canteen can be run very well. That is to say, the key to running a good employee canteen lies in strengthening the work of people and improving the ideological awareness of the culinary staff. Under the education of the Party, the culinary staff of the Dalian Limestone Mine employee canteen have continuously improved their awareness and are able to take care of the habits of the majority of workers in many ways; they are able to do everything possible to improve the quality and variety of food, so that workers can eat economically, eat well, and eat their fill, satisfying everyone, and saving a lot of grain for the country. The achievement of these results is by no means because the conditions of the Dalian Limestone Mine canteen are better than others, nor because the culinary staff of the canteen are more skilled than others. The key issue is that they have raised their awareness and always adhere to putting politics in command.

### 人是办好食堂的关键

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    人是办好食堂的关键
    办好一个食堂像做任何事情一样，虽然需要很多条件，但最重要的还是人，是炊事员，是炊事人员是否真正坚持政治挂帅，树立起全心全意、满腔热情为生产、为群众服务的思想观点。
    职工食堂是职工群众集体生活的组织者。一个职工食堂办得好坏，它不仅关系到职工群众的日常生活，关系到职工的身体健康等切身利益，而且直接关系到生产，关系到社会主义建设。把从事炊事劳动看成是最光荣的，是有其重大政治意义的。这样工作就会积极主动，即使条件再差也能把食堂办得很好。这就是说：办好职工食堂的关键，在于加强人的工作，在于提高炊事人员的思想觉悟。大连石灰石矿职工食堂炊事人员在党的教育下，觉悟不断提高，能够根据大多数工人的习惯，多方面照顾；能够千方百计，提高饭菜质量和花样，使工人们吃得省、吃得好、吃得饱，人人满意，并为国家节约大量粮食。这些成绩的取得，绝不是因为大连石灰石矿食堂的条件比别人好，也不是因为食堂炊事员的技术比别人高明，关键问题在于他们提高了觉悟，始终坚持政治挂帅。
