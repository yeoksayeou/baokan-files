Xinjiang: Mass production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Inner Mongolia: Making early preparations for spring planting. Jilin: Actively expanding the winter sowing area for spring crops. Sichuan: Launching a competition to improve the production of minor spring crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd - Under the action slogan of "We must do a good job in minor spring crops", the vast number of cadres and people in rural Sichuan Province have launched a heated grassroots production competition movement between communes, teams, and groups.

Qixian County in Yibin Prefecture took the lead in launching a high-yield competition for minor spring crops between communes, teams, and groups. Communes and teams in various regions immediately responded, and in a short period of time, production teams and work groups in people's communes across the province were swept into the tide of competition. More than 20 million laborers throughout the province fought on the front lines of minor spring crop production. Many people's communes in Lezhi and Zhongjiang counties, on the basis of carrying out competitions between teams and groups, also carried out continuous competition and organized a "one-stop" competition in autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. Each link was closely connected, and each level checked, which not only accelerated the progress of production, but also ensured the quality of specifications, making the autumn production climax centered on minor spring crop sowing higher and higher throughout the province. As of November 10, the province had sown more than 42 million mu of minor spring food crops and transplanted more than 5.3 million mu of rapeseed. Many places also used fragmented land such as in front of and behind houses to increase the planting of a large number of minor miscellaneous grain crops.

Mobilizing and organizing production competitions between grassroots units has greatly mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of commune cadres, especially production team and small team cadres and the masses. In many places, after carrying out competitions between communes, teams, and groups, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of grassroots cadres and commune members has been unprecedentedly high, and the attendance rate and labor efficiency have been greatly improved. Taking Anyue County as an example, after the communes in the county carried out production competitions between communes, teams, and groups, the number of people involved in the "three autumns" battle in the county increased sharply from more than 300,000 to 600,000, and labor efficiency increased exponentially, and the sowing quality was good, basically achieving deep plowing with sufficient fertilizer and dense planting of improved varieties. Due to the development of competitions between teams and groups, a vivid situation of you chasing me and everyone striving to be advanced has emerged everywhere, and the "five-good" cadres, "five-good" commune members, and "whole family red" commune members in the vast rural areas have sprung up like mushrooms.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun - Various parts of Jilin Province are actively carrying out winter sowing of spring crops. As of November 15, the province had sown more than 1 million mu of crops such as wheat, millet, and small oil crops. At present, winter sowing is about to end, and some places are continuing to organize forces to carry out top-freeze sowing.

Jilin Province began experimenting with winter sowing of spring crops in 1956. By this year, the winter sowing area for spring crops throughout the province had developed to more than 73,000 mu. Practice has proven that winter sowing of spring crops can not only increase production but also regulate farming time. Generally, winter-sown wheat yields 10% to 30% more than spring-sown wheat, millet yields more than 10% more, and sunflowers yield about 20% more.

In carrying out winter sowing, various places have paid attention to adapting to local conditions and planted a large number of crops such as wheat, millet, sunflower, castor, and flax. Small plots have also been tried for crops such as sorghum, soybeans, and corn.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot - Various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are concentrating their efforts on autumn plowing, autumn irrigation, fertilizer accumulation, and the construction of high-yield plots, actively making full preparations for striving for a bumper harvest in agricultural production next year. As of mid-November, the region had plowed 46 million mu of autumn land, 4 million mu more than in the same period last year. More than 7 million mu of autumn irrigation has also increased compared with the same period last year. At the same time, a mass fertilizer accumulation and fertilizer production movement has also been launched in various places.

Spring rain has been scarce in various parts of Inner Mongolia over the years, and spring drought often affects sowing. Therefore, doing a good job in autumn plowing and autumn irrigation is a key measure to resist drought, preserve moisture, and ensure timely spring sowing next year. According to this situation, various places have adopted the method of having the secretary take command and establishing command headquarters at each level, and mobilized the masses early to carry out autumn plowing and autumn irrigation. Strive to plow and irrigate all the land that should be plowed and irrigated before the freeze-up.

While autumn plowing and autumn cultivation are being carried out, various places are also vigorously engaged in fertilizer accumulation and soil improvement. At present, the region has accumulated and produced more than 150 billion jin of various fertilizers.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi - The production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had exceeded the annual plan in terms of variety and quality by the end of October. At present, various places continue to focus on production in the fourth quarter, storing more chemical fertilizers and pesticides for next year's major increase in agricultural production.

This year, according to the principles of local methods, utilizing local materials, rational development, and gradual improvement, various places in the autonomous region have set up many small chemical fertilizer plants. Wheat producing areas such as Urumqi, Manas, and Qitai have all established small nitrogen fertilizer plants using local burnt soil as raw materials.

In increasing the production of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, various places have given full play to the advantages of community-run industries being native-born, closely linked to reality. Most communes in the autonomous region have set up small chemical fertilizer and pesticide plants. Aketao County previously only had one county-run chemical fertilizer plant, and winter wheat fertilizer relied almost entirely on support from other places. This year, using local resources, every commune and team has set up small chemical fertilizer plants. Although the winter wheat planting area has expanded by more than 50,000 mu compared with last year, the required chemical fertilizers have been prepared. (Attached picture)

    及早准备　力争明年农业大丰收
    新疆：大量生产化学肥料和农药  内蒙古：提早做好春播准备工作  吉林：积极扩大春作物冬播面积  四川：开展搞好小春生产竞赛
    本报成都23日电　四川省广大农村干部和群众，在“一定要搞好小春作物”的行动口号下，开展了热火朝天的社与社、队与队、组与组之间的基层生产竞赛运动。
    宜宾专区的琪县首先发起社与社、队与队、组与组之间的小春高产竞赛。各地社、队立即群起响应，很短时间内全省各人民公社的生产队、作业组都风起云涌地卷入了竞赛的浪潮。全省奋战在小春生产第一线的劳力达两千多万人。乐至、中江等县的许多人民公社，在开展队、组之间竞赛的基础上，还开展了连环比武赛，并在秋收、秋耕、秋种中，组织了“一条龙”竞赛，环环扣紧，层层检查，既加快了生产进度，又保证了规格质量，使全省以小春播种为中心的秋季生产高潮一浪高过一浪。到11月10日止，全省已播种小春粮食作物四千二百多万亩，移栽油菜五百三十多万亩。许多地方并利用屋前屋后等零星土地增种了大量的小杂粮作物。
    动员和组织基层单位之间的生产竞赛，大大地调动了公社特别是生产队、小队干部和群众的积极性、创造性。许多地方在开展社、队、组之间的竞赛以后，广大基层干部和社员的生产热情空前高涨，出工率和劳动效率都大大提高。以安岳县为例，这个县各公社在开展社与社、队与队、组与组的生产竞赛以后，全县投入“三秋”战斗的人数由三十多万人激增到六十万人，劳动工效成倍提高，而且播种质量好，基本做到深耕肥足，良种密植。由于队、组之间竞赛的开展，到处出现一片你追我赶、人人争先进的生动局面，广大农村中的“五好”干部，“五好”社员，“全家红”社员风起云涌。
    据新华社讯　吉林省各地积极开展春种作物的冬播工作。到11月15日止，全省已播种小麦、谷子、小油料等作物一百多万亩，目前临冬播种即将结束，有些地方正继续组织力量进行顶冻播种。
    吉林省从1956年就开始春种作物冬播的试验，到今年全省春种作物的冬播面积已发展到七万三千多亩。实践证明：春种作物冬播，既可增产，又能调节农时。一般小麦冬播比春播增产10％到30％，谷子增产10％以上，向日葵增产20％左右。
    各地在开展冬播工作中，注意了因地制宜，大量播种了小麦、谷子、向日葵、蓖麻、线麻子等作物，对于高粱、大豆、苞米等作物也进行了小块地试种。
    据新华社讯　内蒙古自治区各地正集中力量进行秋翻、秋灌、积肥及丰产方建设工作，积极为争取明年农业生产大丰收做好充分准备。到11月中旬，全区已翻秋地四千六百万亩，比去年同时期多翻四百万亩。秋灌七百多万亩，也比去年同期有增加。与此同时，各地还开展了一个群众性的积肥、造肥运动。
    内蒙古各地历年来春雨稀少，往往因为春旱影响播种。因此，做好秋播、秋灌工作是抗旱保墒、保证明年适时春播的关键性措施。各地根据这种情况，都采取书记挂帅和逐级成立指挥部的办法，提早发动群众进行秋翻、秋灌工作。力争在封冻前，把应翻应浇的地都翻过、浇过。
    在秋翻秋耕的同时，各地还大搞积肥和土壤改良等工作。目前，全区已积造各种肥料一千五百多亿斤。
    据新华社讯　新疆维吾尔自治区的化肥、农药生产，到10月底止都已经按品种、质量超额完成了全年计划。目前各地继续狠抓第四季度生产，为明年农业大增产储备更多的化肥、农药。
    今年自治区各地根据土法上马，就地取材，合理发展，逐步提高的原则，办起了许多小型化肥厂。乌鲁木齐、玛纳斯、奇台等小麦产区，都利用当地火烧土作原料建立了小型氮肥厂。
    各地在增产化肥、农药中，充分发挥了社办工业土生土长、密切联系实际的优越性。自治区大部分公社都已办起了小型化肥、农药厂。阿克陶县以前只有一个县里办的化肥厂，冬麦肥料几乎全靠外地支援。今年利用当地资源，社社、队队都办了小型化肥厂，冬麦播种面积虽比去年扩大五万多亩，但所需的化肥都已准备好了。（附图片）
