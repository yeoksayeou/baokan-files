    Profound Friendship
    -- On the China Pavilion at the 19th Plovdiv International Fair
    Qu Jitao
    Entering the China Pavilion at the 19th Plovdiv International Fair, the first thing you see are golden characters that read: "The fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian peoples, built on the foundation of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is eternal and unbreakable." In the short span of fifteen days (from September 18th to October 2nd), the praise and interest shown by more than 700,000 Bulgarian visitors in the Chinese exhibits once again proved the absolute truth of this statement.
    Upon entering the China Pavilion, the "Red Flag" limousine displayed on a pink glass platform immediately caught the attention of the visitors. Comrades from the exhibition hall told us that in the first few days before the opening, the "Red Flag" car had just been set up when, somehow, word spread, and Bulgarian journalists and cadres came one after another, requesting to see the "Red Flag" car first. At that time, since the hall was still being set up with exhibits and dust was flying, the workers had covered the "Red Flag" car with a nylon cloth. However, people wanted to see it carefully and repeatedly requested to uncover the cloth. After the opening, the car was always surrounded by a crowd of people. The crowd constantly exclaimed "Prekrasno!" "Ekstra!" (Bulgarian, meaning "Excellent!") in praise. An article introducing the China Pavilion published in "Workers' Cause" on September 20th wrote: "The audience carefully watched the beautiful seven-seater Red Flag limousine. ... It demonstrates the high level of technology and wisdom of the workers in China's machinery manufacturing industry." An old driver from the "Dimitrov" railway factory in Sofia said excitedly to reporters after seeing the car: "From this limousine, one can see the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. Because you only took ten years to produce such a beautiful car."
    The stream of visitors left the "Red Flag" limousine and flocked to various finely made machine tools. The rumbling of the operating machines attracted the audience. Some asked for brochures, and others tightly grasped their hands, raised them high, and smiled to express their warm congratulations to the Chinese workers operating the machine tools. A staff member from the "Dimitrov" railway factory in Sofia carefully inspected the machine tools and solemnly asked the Chinese comrades at the exhibition hall: "Are these machine tools for sale? If so, we would like to order them first." The audience was quite interested in our policy of simultaneously developing large, medium, and small steel enterprises, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. Many people repeatedly praised, saying, "Good! Good!" One visitor wrote in the guestbook: "Dear Chinese friends, after seeing your light and heavy industrial exhibits, I firmly believe that you will achieve your goals—to catch up with and surpass Britain in the production of some important industrial products within ten years or less."
    Exhibits such as silk, carpets, lacquerware, and porcelain, carefully produced by the Chinese people, especially various ivory carvings, attracted a large audience. The article in "Workers' Cause" introducing the China Pavilion said: "People praised the ivory carvings endlessly. Beauty, wisdom, and skillful techniques can be seen in the exhibits. Here, it seems that some magic created these beautiful patterns and statues, rather than human hands." V. Stefanov wrote in the guestbook, expressing people's boundless praise and excitement. He wrote: "'A nation of art, great wisdom' -- only this is a correct way to call China!"
    The great achievements made by the members of our rural people's communes on the agricultural production front won the praise of the audience. Here, various fine varieties of grain crops, as well as specimens of wheat, barley, and cotton crops, were displayed. People greatly admired the cotton plant cultivated by a people's commune in Henan Province, bearing 265 cotton bolls, and a high-yield cotton plant from Gaomi Farm in Shandong. An old farmer in his seventies kept saying as he watched, "Wonderful! Wonderful! This is the first time I've seen a cotton plant with so many cotton bolls." Here, visitors also lingered for a long time in front of the pictures introducing the production and living conditions of our people's communes.
    The model of the magnificent Great Hall of the People, which was built by the Chinese people in ten months, and the photographs of its internal structure left a deep impression on people. Once, when the Chinese translation comrades were introducing the area, internal structure, and construction time of the Great Hall of the People to the audience, many spectators loudly praised on the spot: "Excellent, this is the real Great Leap Forward!" The "Exhibition News" published on September 24th praised the Great Hall of the People's enormous scale and wrote: "The design and construction of the Great Hall of the People only took ten months, which shows the high speed of socialist construction and the great labor enthusiasm of the working people of People's China."
    The total area of the China Exhibition Hall at the 19th Plovdiv International Fair was 1,000 square meters. The more than 1,900 exhibits in the hall all won the praise of the audience and left them with a deep impression. Please take a look at the thousands of words filled with brotherly affection that Bulgarian visitors wrote in the guestbook after visiting the China Pavilion: D. Milev wrote: "An honest person cannot but rejoice at the giant leap forward of the great Chinese people in socialist construction." Wuyeva from the city of Lom on the Danube River in the northwest wrote: "After visiting the China Pavilion, I feel that the labor enthusiasm is filling the new China." F. Kovachev wrote: "The exhibits in the China Pavilion are liked by everyone. After seeing the China Pavilion, I deeply feel the great achievements that the Chinese people have made in such a short time under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Glory to the fraternal Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the heroic People's Republic of China!" N. Ivanov and I. Zvedanov wrote: "From you, dear friends, we have seen the true defenders of peace." (Attached picture)
    At the International Fair held in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, the Chinese Pavilion was warmly welcomed by the general public. The picture shows the exterior view of the Chinese Pavilion.

    深情厚谊
    ——记第十九次普罗夫迪夫国际博览会中国馆
    曲季涛
    走进第十九次普罗夫迪夫国际博览会的中国馆，首先便可看到几行金字：“中保两国人民建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的兄弟友谊是永恒的和牢不可破的”。在短短的十五天（从9月18日到10月2日），保加利亚七十万余观众对中国展品的赞扬和兴趣，再次证明了这句话是千真万确的。
    进了中国馆，最先吸引住观众视线的，是陈列在粉红色玻璃台上的“红旗”牌小轿车。展览馆的同志告诉我们：在开馆的前几天，“红旗”汽车刚刚摆好，不知道从哪里传出了风声，保加利亚的记者、机关干部相继前来，请求先看看“红旗”汽车。当时由于馆内正摆设展品，尘土飞扬，工人们给“红旗”汽车罩上了尼龙布套。但是，人们都想看个仔细，三番五次请求揭开布套。开馆后，小汽车总是为拥挤的人们围着。人群中不断发出“普列可拉斯诺！”“艾可斯特拉！”（保语，好极了的意思）的赞扬声。“工人事业报”9月20日发表的一篇介绍中国馆的文章中写道：“观众们注意地观看着漂亮的七个座位的红旗牌小汽车。……它表现了中国机器制造业工人的高度技术和智慧。”来自索非亚市的一个老司机看了汽车后，激动地对记者说：“从这部小汽车，就可看出社会主义制度对资本主义制度的优越性。因为你们只十年功夫就制成了这样漂亮的小汽车。”
    参观的人流离开“红旗”小轿车，涌向各种精制的机床。隆隆开动的机器吸引着观众，有的人索要说明书，有的人两手紧握，高高举起，微笑着向开动机床的中国工人表示热烈祝贺。索非亚市“季米特洛夫”铁路工厂的一个工作人员仔细观看了机床后，郑重地向展览馆的中国同志提出：“你们的这些机床卖不卖？如果卖，我们先订下。”观众对我国炼钢的大、中、小型企业并举和土洋并举的方针颇感兴趣。许多人连声称赞说：“好！好！”一个观众在留言簿上写道：“亲爱的中国朋友们，看了你们的轻重工业展品之后，深信你们会达到你们提出的目标——在十年或更短的时间内，在一些重要工业品生产方面赶上和超过英国。”
    我国人民精心生产的绸缎、地毯、漆器、瓷器等展品，特别是各种象牙雕刻，吸引着大量的观众。“工人事业报”介绍中国馆的文章说：“人们对象牙雕刻赞美不绝。美丽、智慧和熟练的技巧，都可以从展品中看出。在这里，仿佛是什么魔力创造了这些美丽的花色和雕像，而不是人类的手。”维·斯捷凡诺夫在留言簿上写出了人们的无比称赞和激动的心情。他写道：“‘艺术的国家，伟大的智慧’——只有这样称呼中国才对！”
    我国农村人民公社社员们在农业生产战线上取得的巨大成就，博得了观众赞扬。在这里，陈列着各种粮食作物的优良品种，以及小麦、大麦和棉花作物的标本。人们十分欣赏河南省一个人民公社培植的结有二百六十五个棉桃的棉花和山东高密农场的一株高产棉。一个七十多岁的农民老大爷一面看，一面不住地说：“真好！真好！我第一次看到一株棉花上结这样多棉桃。”在这里，观众们还久久地停留在介绍我国人民公社的生产和生活情况的图片前面。
    我国人民在十个月内建成的雄伟的万人大礼堂——人民大会堂的模型和内部结构的照片，给人们留下了很深的印象。有一次，中国的翻译同志向观众们介绍万人大礼堂的面积、内部结构和修建的时间时，许多观众当场高声赞扬说：“真行，这才是真正的跃进！”9月24日出版的
  “博览会新闻”赞扬人民大会堂的巨大规模时写道：“人民大会堂的设计和建成仅只用了十个月时间，这显示了社会主义建设的高速度和人民中国劳动人民的巨大的劳动热忱。”
    第十九次普罗夫迪夫国际博览会中国展览馆的总面积是一千平方米。馆中展出的一千九百多种展品，都博得了观众的赞扬，给他们留下了深刻的印象。请看看保加利亚观众参观了中国馆后，在留言簿上写下的充溢着兄弟般情谊的千言万语吧：迪·米列夫写道：“诚实的人不能不对伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设中的巨人般的跃进而欢欣鼓舞。”来自西北部多瑙河沿岸的罗姆市的芜耶娃写道：“参观了中国馆，我感到劳动热情充满着新中国。”弗·科瓦切夫写道：“中国馆的展品使所有的人都喜欢，我看了中国馆后，深深感到中国人民在中国共产党领导下，在相当短的时间里取得的这样大的成就。光荣归于兄弟中国人民、中国共产党和英雄的中华人民共和国！”尼·依万诺夫和依·兹维丹诺夫写的是：“从你们那里，亲爱的朋友们，我们看到了和平的真正保卫者。”（附图片）
