	Relying on the Masses in Everything, Being Grounded in Every Place
	— A Record of Li Sufang, Party Branch Secretary of the Fuxing Management District, Shuanglong Commune
	Zhonggong Linshui Xianwei Tongxun Zu

	In the Fuxing Management District of Shuanglong Commune, Linshui County, Sichuan, there is a grassroots commander who is realistic and down-to-earth in her work. Wherever there is difficulty, she appears; wherever there is a problem, she goes to solve it. While commune members are sound asleep after a day's labor, she is still studying the Party's policies and instructions intently under the lamp, often staying up late at night. She is Comrade Li Sufang, a member of the commune's Party committee and the Party branch secretary of the Fuxing Management District, who is deeply loved by the masses.
		Being Realistic and Meticulous
	Comrade Li Sufang always starts from reality, seeks truth from facts, and is meticulous in her attitude towards work and handling problems. She will do everything possible to complete any task that can be accomplished through subjective effort. For things that cannot be accomplished through subjective effort, she always puts forward her own opinions based on the actual situation and truthfully reflects them to the higher authorities.

	During the spring planting this year, the commune Party committee required each management district to complete the first batch of early corn sowing ahead of schedule and used this as an important condition for evaluating red banners. Comrade Li Sufang comprehensively analyzed the growth of various crops: more than 1,300 mu of wheat urgently needed topdressing, early rice seedling fields had to be leveled, and the soil for 420 mu of early corn had not yet been prepared, and base fertilizer had not been applied. Considering the shortage of labor, she believed that the early corn should never be sown ahead of schedule for the sake of winning the red banner, without regard to quality, and that production must be comprehensively arranged. At that time, a few cadres advocated applying less fertilizer and rushing to plant in order to win the red banner. Comrade Li Sufang firmly disagreed. She thought: Leading the masses in production is not for the sake of showing off; if one only wants to "win the red flag" without paying attention to the actual results, this is not the work style that a Communist Party member and a revolutionary cadre should have. Therefore, on the one hand, she persuaded and educated the cadres who held this view; on the other hand, she asked the commune Party committee for instructions and obtained the Party committee's consent. As a result, because they took care of everything comprehensively and arranged things appropriately, the wheat topdressing and corn sowing tasks were both completed very well.

	Comrade Li Sufang's excellent work style of seeking truth from facts runs through all aspects like a red thread. The Fuxing Management District under her leadership has always been an advanced management district among the 47 management districts in Jiulong District. However, she does not ignore shortcomings because of achievements. She never conceals even minor shortcomings. This year, 34 mu of early rice in her management district had insufficient base fertilizer and the work was relatively rough, and the seedlings were growing poorly. When the district committee went to inspect production, she truthfully reported the situation and eliminated the more than 30 mu of third-class seedlings within a limited time in accordance with the instructions of the district committee. In May of this year, an accountant made a mistake in the number of mid-season rice planted, reporting ten mu more to the commune Party committee. After she found out, she immediately called the Party committee to request a correction.
		Analyzing Difficulties and Overcoming Difficulties

	Comrade Li Sufang attaches great importance to the opinions of grassroots cadres and commune members. She listens to good opinions, and she also listens to bad opinions. When lower-level cadres talk to her about the difficulties in their work, she always helps them analyze the reasons and find specific ways to solve the difficulties.

	Last winter, the management district decided to increase the planting of 20 mu of winter radishes in each team. The seventh team did not complete the task, but the captain, Liu Wanshou, reported to the higher authorities that he had overfulfilled the plan. After Comrade Li Sufang discovered this, she helped the team find ways to specifically solve the difficulties of labor, seeds, and land. After the task was completed, a conference of cadres and the masses was held here to use specific facts to illustrate the importance of reporting the actual situation to the higher authorities in a timely manner, so that the cadres and the masses received a vivid education on the excellent work style of seeking truth from facts. When transplanting late rice in July this year, the progress of the first production team was slow. Comrade Li Sufang immediately went to the team to find the reasons and found that the main reason was that the labor force was not on the front line and the work arrangement was chaotic. After properly arranging the labor force, they caught up with the other teams in less than three days.

	Comrade Li Sufang said: "In order to engage in production and construction, if you do not get the true situation, you will not know where to put your energy. If lower-level cadres report difficulties to you, you must help them find ways to solve the difficulties. If the actual problems are not solved, it will bring greater harm to the work."

	Comrade Li Sufang never relies on listening to reports to lead production. She works very deeply. Every piece of land in the entire management district has her footprints, she has worked in every production group, she has cooked and eaten in every canteen, and she has visited every household. Therefore, she knows the situation of the entire management district like the back of her hand, and the commune members praised her as the "Thousand-Eyed Guanyin." Under her influence, the cadres worked more deeply and solidly. Each cadre in the management district is fixed in one team to participate in and lead production, fixed in one canteen to eat, regularly goes to the canteen as a cook, and participates in the management of the canteen. Whenever the management district studies work, they truthfully reflect the work in their fixed area to the Party branch, so that the branch's leadership work is strong and effective.
	Going Deep into the Masses, Relying on the Masses, Being Down-to-Earth, Daring to Think and Act

	Comrade Li Sufang often says: "A single thread cannot make a line, and a single tree cannot make a forest. To beat the 'three shifts' drum,' you need several sets of people. The affairs of the masses must be initiated and relied on by the masses themselves." In the Fuxing Management District, all the farmers with production experience and the energetic and ambitious young lads are her "staff officers" for leading production. Whenever a task comes from the higher authorities, or when difficulties are encountered in the work, she brings these "staff officers" together to discuss and study. Because Comrade Li Sufang implements the practice of consulting with the masses on matters and fully utilizes the wisdom of the masses, she has powerfully promoted various production and work tasks. This year, when rushing to harvest the minor spring crops and rush to plant the major spring crops, the area was expanded, the technical specifications were strict, and the labor force was particularly tight. How can we grasp both the major and minor spring crops? She brought the "staff officers" to discuss it. Through repeated research, it was decided to divide the work according to the urgency of the tasks, fight on separate lines, focus on key points, and assign specific tasks to each group with a deadline for completion. In this way, the center led the others, several sets of gongs and drums were beaten together, ensuring the early completion of the rush harvesting and planting tasks.

	Comrade Li Sufang's work is not only full of revolutionary enthusiasm, but also adheres to the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts and the work style of the mass line. In order to transform low yield into high yield and transform one season into two seasons, Comrade Li Sufang proposed in the spring of 1958 to use 300 mu of cold-soaked fields to plant one season of wheat. Some old farmers suggested that these fields had never been planted with wheat in history, and they did not know its temper. Could they plant less and try it out first? Comrade Li Sufang thought it made sense and adopted the opinions of the old farmers. Since then, the old farmers have been particularly active in production, spending all day drilling into the fields to figure out the temper of the cold-soaked fields. Due to deep ditches for drainage, sufficient fertilizer, and careful management, it was indeed successful, and the wheat yield per mu was more than 250 jin. Last year, the wheat planting area expanded from 430 mu in 1958 to more than 1,300 mu. After the cold-soaked fields were planted with wheat, the fertilizer was increased, the temperature was raised, and the rice grew particularly well, and the yield per mu increased from 260 jin to 400 jin. Poor peasant Feng Guangqiao said: "I have lived for ninety-three years, and I have never seen the fields of Majiaba harvest two good crops a year. The Communist Party has so many good ideas and good methods!"

	Comrade Li Sufang not only focuses on production, but also focuses on life. After communization, she paid special attention to collective life and personally led the work of life and welfare. She and the cadres of the management district and production team leaders also took turns going to the canteen as cooks, discovering problems and exploring the experience of running the canteen well. Once, she heard that several commune members in the third canteen had opinions on the food, so she personally asked them to understand the situation. It turned out that some cooks were not clean and did not serve meals on time, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses. She immediately went to the canteen to help the cooks improve their work. Because Comrade Li Sufang strengthened specific leadership over collective life, all nine canteens were run very well.

	Comrade Li Sufang's work style of going deep into reality, going deep into the masses, and seeking truth from facts has set an example for all rural work cadres and has been repeatedly praised by the county party committee.

    事事依靠群众　处处脚踏实地
    ——记双龙公社复兴管区党支部书记李素芳
    中共邻水县委通讯组
    四川邻水县双龙公社复兴管理区，有一个实事求是、工作踏实的基层指挥员。哪里有困难，她就出现在哪里；哪里有问题，她就到哪里去解决。当社员们经过一天劳动已在酣睡的时候，她还在灯下聚精会神地学习党的政策和指示，经常深夜不眠。她就是深受群众爱戴的公社党委委员、复兴管理区的党支部书记李素芳同志。
            实事求是　一丝不苟
    李素芳同志对待工作，处理问题，总是从实际出发，实事求是，一丝不苟。凡是经过主观努力可以办到的事情，她一定千方百计，努力完成。凡是经过主观努力办不到的事，她总是根据实际情况，提出自己的意见，真实地向上级反映。
    今年春播时，公社党委要求各管理区第一批早玉米提前完成播种任务，并作为评比红旗的一个重要条件。李素芳同志全面分析了各项作物的生长情况：一千三百多亩小麦急需上一次追肥，又要平整早稻秧田，四百二十亩早玉米土还未整出来，底肥未下；再考虑到劳力不足的情况，她认为决不能为了夺红旗，不顾质量，把早玉米提前播下，而必须全面安排生产。当时有少数干部为了夺红旗，主张少上肥，突击播种。李素芳同志坚决不同意，她想：领导群众生产不是为了出风头；如果单纯为了“夺取红旗”，而不重视实际效果，这不是共产党员和革命干部应该有的作风。因此，她一方面对持有这种意见的干部进行说服教育；另方面又向公社党委请示，取得了党委的同意。结果由于他们照顾全面，安排适当，小麦追肥和玉米播种任务都很好地完成了。
    李素芳同志的这种实事求是的优良作风，像一根红线一样贯串在各个方面，她领导的复兴管理区一直是九龙区四十七个管理区中的先进管理区，但是，她并不因为成绩而忽视缺点，哪怕是微小的缺点，她也决不隐讳。今年她那个管理区有三十四亩早稻，由于底肥不足，活路比较粗糙，秧苗生长不好。当区委去检查生产的时候，她如实地作了汇报，并根据区委的指示，限期把三十多亩三类苗消灭了。今年5月，有一次会计把中稻栽插的数字弄错了，向公社党委多报了十亩，她知道以后，立即给党委打电话，要求更正。
          分析困难　克服困难
    李素芳同志很重视基层干部和社员的意见，说好的她听，说不好的她也听。遇到下面干部向她谈工作中的困难，她总是帮助他们分析原因，寻找解决困难的具体办法。
    去年冬季，管理区决定每个队增种二十亩冬萝卜。七队没有完成，队长刘万寿却向上级汇报超额完成了计划。李素芳同志发现后，就帮助这个队想办法，具体解决劳力、种籽和土地的困难。任务完成后，就在这里召开了干部、群众大会，用具体事实来说明及时向上级反映实际情况的重要性，使干部、群众受到了一场生动活泼的实事求是的优良作风的教育。今年7月栽插晚稻的时候，第一生产队进度慢，李素芳同志立即到该队去找原因，发现主要是劳力没上第一线，排工混乱，经过妥善安排劳力，不到三天就赶上了其他队。
    李素芳同志说：搞生产建设，得不到真实情况，就不知道劲往哪里使。下面干部向你反映了困难，一定要帮助他们寻找解决困难的办法，实际问题得不到解决，就会给工作带来更大的损害。
    李素芳同志从来不靠听汇报领导生产，她工作十分深入。全管理区的每一块地都有她的脚迹，每个生产小组她去干过活，每个食堂她去煮过饭、吃过饭，每家每户她去串过门。因此，她对全管理区的情况了如指掌，社员们都称赞她是“千眼观音”。在她的影响下，干部们工作更加深入扎实了。管理区的干部个个都固定在一个队参加生产领导生产，固定在一个食堂吃饭、定期下食堂当炊事员、参加食堂的管理，每当管理区研究工作的时候，都各自将固定地区的工作如实向党支部反映，因此，使支部领导工作坚强有力。
    深入群众　依靠群众　踏踏实实　敢想敢干
    李素芳同志常说：“单丝不成线，独木不成林。要打三班鼓，就离不了几套人。群众的事一定要发动群众、依靠群众自己来办。”在复兴管理区里，凡是有生产经验的农民，和朝气蓬勃、钻劲十足的青年小伙子，都是她领导生产的“参谋”。每逢上级的任务一来，或者工作中碰到困难的时候，她就把这些“参谋”们找来商量研究。由于李素芳同志贯彻了有事与群众商量，充分发挥了群众的智慧，有力地推动了各项生产和工作。今年抢收小春、抢栽大春时，由于面积扩大，技术规格要求严，劳动力特别紧。怎样才能把大小春都抓好？她把“参谋”找来商量。通过反复研究，决定根据活路的缓急，分线作战，重点突击，各项任务具体落实到组，限期完成。这样就做到了中心带其他，几套锣鼓一齐打，保证了抢收抢栽任务提前完成。
    李素芳同志在工作中既充满了革命热情，又坚持实事求是的科学精神和群众路线的工作作风。为了变低产为高产，变一季为两季，李素芳同志在1958年春提出来用三百亩冷浸田种一季小麦。有些老农提出，这些田有史以来都未种过小麦，摸不着是啥脾气，是不是可以少种点，先试验试验。李素芳同志认为有道理，采纳了老农的意见。此后，老农们生产分外积极，一天到晚钻在田里摸冷浸田的脾气。由于沟深滤水，肥料足，管理细致，果然成功了，小麦亩产二百五十多斤。去年，小麦播种面积就由1958年的四百三十亩扩大到一千三百多亩。冷浸田种了小麦以后，增加了肥料，提高了温度，水稻生长特别好，亩产由二百六十斤提高到四百斤。贫农冯广乔说：“我活了九十三岁，还没见过马家坝的田一年能收两季好庄稼，共产党的好主意、好办法真多啊！”
    李素芳同志不仅狠抓生产，而且也狠抓生活。公社化后，她特别关心集体生活，亲自领导生活福利工作。她还和管理区的干部、生产队长轮流下食堂当炊事员，发现问题和摸索办好食堂的经验。有一次她听说第三食堂有几个社员对伙食有意见，她就亲自找他们了解情况。原来是有个别炊事员不爱清洁，开饭不按时，引起群众不满。她马上就下食堂，帮助炊事员改进了工作。由于李素芳同志对集体生活加强了具体领导，九个食堂都办得很好。
    李素芳同志这种深入实际，深入群众，实事求是的工作作风，为所有农村工作干部树立了榜样，曾多次受到县委的表扬。
