    A Contest Between Rivals
    On the short-distance transportation line from the Tieshan North Iron Mine in Jiangxi to the Xinyu Railway Station, trucks loaded with ore shuttle back and forth. The drivers are launching a competition to "transport more, transport faster, and ensure high output."
    After hearing the briefing on launching the campaign to increase production and practice thrift, the drivers in the First Fleet’s driving team of the Yichun Highway Transportation Bureau were all full of energy. Young drivers Lu Mansheng and Liu Jingxing launched a friendly competition with veteran driver Chen Benzhu, comparing who could transport more, transport faster, and who could operate more safely and take better care of their vehicles. Chen Benzhu immediately accepted the challenge.
    “How to improve transportation efficiency?” was a common concern in this competition. Several drivers gathered together to discuss it. Wang Jingbo, the deputy captain stationed at the site to participate in and lead production, also discussed it with them and offered suggestions. Everyone started by reviewing past work and found two solutions: one was to do a more conscientious and detailed job of maintaining and repairing the trucks and trailers, ensuring they were always in good condition, and making sure every truck towed a trailer on every trip, striving to transport more; the other was to implement a "two-point with middle, three-vehicle staggered running" method, meaning that of the three vehicles, one would be loading at the starting point, one would be unloading at the terminal point, and the other would be driving in the middle, avoiding simultaneous arrivals and waiting for loading and unloading.
    The next day, the three vehicles, with six people working in two shifts around the clock, increased the average number of trips by two compared to the past, and the vehicle-day mileage, freight volume, and turnover volume all increased by more than 20%. Veteran driver Chen Benzhu and his co-driver, trainee driver Xie Jinhuo, worked closely together and made sixteen trips in twenty-four hours, also increasing transportation efficiency by 50%.

    一场对手赛
    从江西铁山北铁矿到新余火车站的短途运输线上，一辆辆满载着矿石的汽车川流不息地运行着。驾驶员们正在展开一场“以多运快运保高产”的竞赛。
    宜春公路运输分局第一车队行车小组听了开展增产节约运动的传达以后，全组驾驶员个个干劲十足。青年驾驶员芦曼生、刘景星就和老驾驶员陈本琢展开了比多运快运、比安全运行、比爱护车辆的友谊竞赛。陈本琢也马上应战。
    “怎样提高运输效率？”是这场竞赛中共同关心的问题，几个驾驶员凑在一起议论开了。驻点参加生产和领导生产的副队长王靖波也跟他们一起商量，给他们出点子。大家从检查以往工作入手，找到了两条办法：一条是更加认真细致地做好汽车、挂车的保养检修工作，保证经常完好，做到车车拖挂，趟趟拖挂，力争多运；另一条是实行“两点带中间，三车交错跑”的办法，即三辆车一辆在起点装车，一辆在终点卸车，另一辆在中途行驶，避免同时到达，等待装卸。
    第二天，他们三辆车，六个人双班运行一昼夜，平均运行次数比以往增加了两次，车日行程和运量，周转量都提高20％以上。老驾驶员陈本琢和同车的实习驾驶员谢金火密切合作，二十四小时内运行了十六次，运输效率也提高了50％。（茅舍）
