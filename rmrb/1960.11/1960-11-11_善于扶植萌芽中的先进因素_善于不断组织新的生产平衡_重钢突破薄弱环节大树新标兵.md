Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 10th: In the process of carrying out the competition to catch up with the Fifteen Red Banners, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, focusing on the current key to production, continuously planted red flags and established pace-setters in weak links. Through this approach, advanced factors were promptly promoted, new balances were actively organized, and the competition was promoted to advance wave upon wave, with each wave higher than the last. New weak links in production were continuously broken through, and new keys were continuously resolved, enabling a substantial and sustained increase in steel production. In October, the company's daily steel production level increased by 16.3% compared to September, steel materials increased by 19.3%, and pig iron increased by 26.6%. In the first eight days of November, the output of iron and steel and steel materials further increased.

At the beginning of October, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company further strengthened political and ideological work, and established fifteen red banners in key links such as open-hearth furnaces, converters, iron-smelting furnaces, gas furnaces, and blast furnaces. It also launched a vigorous "Catch Up with the Fifteen Red Banners" competition among all employees. Under the impetus of the fifteen red banners, a large number of new advanced units emerged, and more than fifty furnaces, teams, and groups in the company quickly caught up with the advanced level of the fifteen red banners. At the same time, the ideological awareness of the broad masses of employees has also been further improved, the communist spirit has been greatly promoted, and production has been powerfully boosted. With the rapid development of production, the old balance was broken, but at the same time, some new imbalances arose, and some weak links appeared. For example, the daily steel production level has greatly increased, but the supply of coke, ore, limestone, and ferroalloys, which are closely related to it, has become insufficient. Transportation and post-furnace casting have also become prominent weak links. The existence of these weak links has affected the sustained and substantial leap forward in major production departments. According to this situation, the company's Party committee first mobilized the masses to conduct a thorough investigation and ranking of key production problems. As a result, six weak links that urgently needed to be resolved were identified: raw material consumption, broken scrap steel, improved converter furnace life, transportation, stone supply, and insufficient supply of post-furnace ingot molds. Each factory also, based on its own production situation, clarified the key points. Subsequently, the company's Party committee closely combined the competition to catch up with the fifteen red banners and launched a mass-based key problem solving performance competition among the broad masses of employees. Advanced units were discovered and cultivated from the performance competition, and advanced experience was summarized and promoted through on-site meetings. When a factory or a team or group made achievements, on-site meetings were immediately held to call on all employees of the entire factory and company to learn, and new red flags were erected in the new weak links, so that the employees in each weak link had more specific goals to learn from and catch up with, thereby advancing the red flag competition a big step forward.

In the movement, leading cadres at all levels went to the front line to solve ideological problems together with the workers, held seminars and debates, sought advanced factors, and summarized and tested budding advanced operations, so that imperfect advanced experiences were gradually improved, and perfect experiences were raised to a higher level. For example, in response to the insufficient supply of steel ingot molds and the failure of post-furnace casting to keep up with smelting, the secretary of the company's Party committee personally convened a forum with cadres and workers from the casting sections of the four converter plants to analyze and study methods to solve these two weak links, and called on the workers of the four sections to strive to break through this link and strive to become the "Sixteenth Red Banner." After returning to the factory, the workers of Converter Plant No. 1 immediately conducted a large-scale debate, criticizing the one-sided thinking of a few people who only emphasized objective difficulties and did not give play to people's subjective initiative. After repeated practice and exploration, they first created a new record of 100% demolding efficiency. Then, they further selected twenty-four steel ingot molds for testing, so that each of these steel ingot molds was used more than fifty times, and three of them even reached more than one hundred times. Therefore, the section branch organized employees to hold seminars and an exhibition of "Long-Life Molds" to illustrate with powerful facts that overcoming this weak link first lies in giving full play to everyone's subjective initiative.

The failure of transportation to keep up with the substantial growth in production was another prominent weak link that urgently needed to be resolved. To this end, the company's deputy chief engineer and nationally renowned model worker, Huang Rongchang, went deep into the mechanized workshop and worked with the "three-in-one combination" (leading cadres, workers, and technicians) group here to persistently experiment and vigorously carry out technical revolution, focusing on the key to low unloading efficiency in transportation. They finally gnawed off this "hard bone" and successfully created an automatic unloading method, which increased work efficiency by eighty times, and hoisted a bright red flag in transportation.

Through the joint efforts of leading cadres and employees of various units, in more than half a month, eighteen red flags were raised in various weak links such as conservation, supply, steel ingot molds, and furnace protection. At the same time, fifty-five individual pacesetters were selected. The advanced experience and advanced thinking of these red flag units greatly enhanced the confidence of employees in overcoming difficulties and breaking through new weak links, and also provided employees in these links with a complete set of practical and feasible specific experiences. Therefore, as soon as a red flag was raised, each unit immediately organized employees to learn from and seek treasures. For example, the No. 3 blast furnace of the iron smelting plant was a relatively weak link in the entire plant's production. In this red flag competition, the first shift in front of the furnace first created three furnaces of iron per shift, breaking through the weak link in front of the furnace, and was named "Pioneer Shift" by the plant's Party committee. The employees of the third shift immediately closely followed, grasping the three links of production preparation, production key, and cooperation, and first caught up with the first shift, creating a new record of four furnaces of iron per shift. At this time, the second shift was relatively behind, and they immediately put forward the slogan "Learn from the First Shift, Surpass the Third Shift, and Seize the Red Flag to Insert in Our Shift," and quickly caught up. The result of one shift surpassing another promoted a substantial increase in output, and the weak link of the No. 3 blast furnace was quickly eliminated, creating favorable conditions for the continuous high yield of iron smelting production.

Currently, the company's leading cadres are continuing to vigorously organize all employees in the company to catch up with the advanced, in order to push the vigorous mass movement to a new peak.

    善于扶植萌芽中的先进因素  善于不断组织新的生产平衡
    重钢突破薄弱环节大树新标兵
    新华社重庆10日电　重庆钢铁公司在开展追赶十五面红旗的竞赛运动中，针对当前生产关键，在薄弱环节上不断大插红旗、大树标兵。通过这一做法，及时发扬先进因素，积极组织新的平衡，推动了竞赛前浪带后浪、一浪高一浪地前进，生产中新的薄弱环节不断被攻破，新的关键不断得到解决，使钢铁生产大幅度地持续上升。10月份，全公司钢的日产水平比9月份增长了16.3％，钢材增长19.3％，生铁增长26.6％；11月份的前八天，钢铁和钢材的产量又有了进一步的增长。
    10月初，重庆钢铁公司进一步加强了政治思想工作，在平炉、转炉、化铁炉、煤气炉、高炉等主要环节，树起了十五面红旗，并且发动全公司职工展开了热火朝天的“追赶十五面红旗”的竞赛运动。在十五面红旗的带动下，新的先进单位大批涌现，全公司有五十多个炉子和班、组，迅速赶上了十五面红旗的先进水平。同时，广大职工的思想觉悟也有了进一步的提高，共产主义精神大大发扬，有力地推动了生产。随着生产的飞跃发展，突破了旧的平衡，同时也产生了一些新的不平衡，出现了一些薄弱环节。例如钢的日产水平大大上升，但是同它密切相关的焦炭、矿石、石灰石和铁合金等的供应方面，就显得跟不上；运输和炉后浇铸等，也成了突出的薄弱环节。这些薄弱环节的存在，影响了主要生产部门持续大幅度地跃进。公司党委根据这种情况，首先发动群众对生产关键问题进行了摸底和排队，结果找出了当前迫切需要解决的六个薄弱环节：原料材料消耗，破碎废钢铁，提高转炉炉龄，运输，石料供应，炉后钢锭模供应不足。各厂也从自己的生产情况出发，摸清了关键。随后，公司党委便紧密结合追赶十五面红旗竞赛运动，发动广大职工展开了群众性的攻关表演赛。从表演竞赛中发现先进，培养先进，并且通过现场会，总结和推广先进经验；一个厂、一个班组作出了成绩，立即召开现场会议，号召全厂全公司职工学习，在新的薄弱环节中树起新的红旗，使每个薄弱环节的职工都有更具体的学习和追赶的目标，从而把追红旗的竞赛运动向前推进了一大步。
    在运动中，各级领导干部都亲临第一线，同工人一道从解决思想问题着手，开座谈会，辩论会，寻找先进因素，把萌芽性的先进操作加以总结试验，使不完善的先进经验逐渐完善起来，使完善的经验更上一层楼。如公司党委书记针对钢锭模供应不足、炉后浇铸跟不上冶炼的问题，亲自召集四个转炉厂浇铸工段的干部和工人进行座谈，分析研究解决这两个薄弱环节的方法，号召四个工段的工人努力突破这一环，争取做“第十六面红旗”。转炉一厂工人回厂以后，立即进行了一场大辩论，批判了少数人只强调客观困难不发挥人的主观能动性的片面思想。他们经过反复的实践摸索，首先创造了脱模效率高达百分之百的新纪录；接着，又进一步选择二十四根钢锭模做试验，使这些钢锭模每根使用次数达到五十次以上，有三根还达到一百次以上。于是，工段支部就针对这些事实组织职工座谈，举办“长寿模”展览会，用有力的事实说明克服这项薄弱环节首先在于发挥每个人的主观能动性。
    运输跟不上生产大幅度增长需要，是急待解决的又一突出薄弱环节。为此，公司副总工程师、全国著名的老模范黄荣昌，深入机械化车间，同这里的“三结合”（领导干部、工人和技术人员）小组，针对运输工作中卸车效率低的关键，顽强试验，大闹技术革命，终于很快啃掉了这个“硬骨头”，创造成功自动卸车法，使工效提高了八十倍，在运输方面挂起了一面鲜艳的红旗。
    经过各单位领导干部和职工的共同努力，半个多月的时间内，在节约、供应、钢锭模、护炉等各个薄弱环节上，升起了十八面红旗，同时又评出了五十五个个人标兵。这些红旗单位的先进经验和先进思想，大大增强了职工克服困难、突破新的薄弱环节的信心，也为这些环节的职工提供了成套的、切实可行的具体经验。因此，一面红旗树起，各单位就立即组织职工取经索宝，如炼铁厂三号高炉是全厂生产中较薄弱的一环；这次在追红旗的竞赛中，炉前一班首先创造一班放三炉铁，突破了炉前的薄弱环节，被厂党委命名为“先锋班”；三班职工立即紧紧追赶，他们抓住了生产准备、生产关键和协作三环，首先赶上一班，创造了一班放四炉铁的新纪录。这时，二班就相对地落后了，他们立即提出“学一班、超三班、夺取红旗插我班”的口号，很快就赶了上去。这样一班赶过一班的结果，促使产量大幅度上升，三号高炉这个薄弱环节很快被消除，为炼铁生产的持续高产创造了良好条件。
    目前，公司的领导干部正在继续大力组织全公司职工追赶先进，以便把轰轰烈烈的群众运动推向一个新高峰。
