Valuable in its Timeliness

To strive for an even greater summer harvest next year, for a production team, a commune, a county, a province, and even on a national scale, providing strong support to poor teams (regions) and backward teams (regions) in the current autumn planting is a major undertaking of realistic significance.

Taking the situation in Lu'an County as an example, poor and backward teams account for over 22 percent of the county's production teams. The average wheat yield of these teams this year is only half of the county's average, and the area of summer harvested crops accounts for only 34 percent of their total cultivated land. If these production teams are helped to expand the area of autumn planting and improve the quality of sowing, then the summer grain yield of these teams next year will definitely increase significantly. Therefore, the summer grain yield of Lu'an County will certainly have a considerable leap forward.

The support provided by Lu'an County to poor and backward teams from all walks of life, in terms of manpower, materials, financial resources, and technology, is a tremendous force, prompting a new atmosphere in the autumn sowing work of these production teams: sowing earlier, more, and better than last year.

However, the most valuable aspect of Lu'an County's assistance to poor and backward teams lies in its timeliness. Autumn planting sows the seeds of the first batch of harvests next year. The quality of autumn planting is greatly related to whether these units can shed the labels of "poor" and "backward" next year. Therefore, in order to help poor and backward teams do a good job in production next year, we should start with autumn planting, just like Lu'an County.

    贵在适时
    一个生产队、一个公社、一个县、一个省，甚至就全国范围来说，要夺取明年夏季更大丰收，在当前秋种中给穷队（地区）、后进队（地区）以大力支援，是一项具有现实意义的大事。
    以六安县的情况来看，穷队和后进队的数量占全县生产队的百分之二十二强，这些队今年小麦平均产量只有全县平均产量的一半，夏收作物的面积也只占其全部耕地的百分之三十四。如果帮助这些生产队扩大秋种面积，提高播种质量，那么，明年这些队的夏粮产量一定会大幅度增长。因此，六安县的夏粮产量也一定会有一个可观的跃进数字。
    六安县组织各行各业，从人力、物力、财力和技术等方面对穷队和后进队的支援，是一股巨大的力量，促使这些生产队的秋播工作出现了新气象：比去年种得早、种得多、种得好。
    但是，六安县帮助穷队和后进队的更可贵之处，在于适时。秋种，播下的是明年第一批丰收种子。秋种工作的好坏，对这些单位明年能否摘掉“穷”和“后进”的帽子有很大关系。因此，为了帮助穷队和后进队搞好明年生产，应该像六安县一样，从秋种抓起。
