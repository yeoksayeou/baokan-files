    Taking Root and Blossoming in the Countryside
    Lin Xu
    Autumn is the season of harvest. Harvest is joyful. However, without sowing, there is no harvest; without seeds taking root and blossoming in the soil, there is no way to bear abundant fruit. Therefore, I often think that the role of seeds is too valuable.
    When a seed falls, lush seedlings grow; when a sapling is planted, towering trees grow. Where there are seeds, there is always vigor and vitality. All the flowers and grains of the world, all the grasses and trees, cannot do without seeds. How does the fragrance of rice flowers drift over thousands of miles of plains? How do barren hills turn into orchards? How does the boundless desert become an oasis? One of the reasons is the presence of seeds. Seeds bring vitality to the earth; seeds bring harvest and hope to mankind.
    The vitality of seeds is so vigorous. As long as there is sunshine, rain, and soil, seeds will grow sturdily, taking root, sprouting, blossoming, and bearing fruit. Whether in high mountains or plains, whether in fertile fields or barren land, whether in the cold winter or the hot summer, there are always seeds growing on the earth. Seeds, from the soil, from the cracks in the rocks, joyfully raise their heads to greet the sun, and thousands upon thousands of seeds are constantly changing the face of nature.
  Because of this, people give meticulous care and love to seeds from rooting to fruiting.
    I think the growth of revolutionary youth and revolutionary cadres is also like that of seeds.
    I read a joyful piece of news in the newspaper: more than six million educated youth across the country have gone to the front line of agricultural production and taken root in the countryside. The news said: "The Party's mobilization order for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, like a spring breeze, has instantly swept across the land of the motherland. In the north and south of the Yangtze River, inside and outside the Great Wall, from cities to towns, from factories to schools, from shops to institutions, teams and teams of young people, carrying backpacks, wearing red flowers, full of vigor and enthusiasm, have walked out, heading towards the vast countryside, determined to work in the countryside for a lifetime to build socialism and realize communism."
    More than six million young people have gone to the countryside! More than six million seeds have been sown into the soil! Seeing this, people's mood is more joyful than seeing any sowing. Because this is not ordinary sowing, this is not ordinary seeds, this is a revolutionary feat, a construction feat, these are revolutionary seeds, construction seeds. People naturally have much greater hope for such seeds, and the joy in their hearts is naturally endless.
    In 1945, due to the needs of the revolution, many comrades went from Yan'an to the front to work. Chairman Mao taught these comrades: "All comrades who go to the front should be mentally prepared, prepared to take root, blossom, and bear fruit when they get there. We Communists are like seeds, and the people are like the land. When we arrive in a place, we must unite with the people there and take root and blossom among the people."
    For many years, countless revolutionary cadres have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, taken root among the people, blossomed, and borne fruit. They are not afraid of any difficulties, they are not afraid of any risks, and no matter how difficult the environment, no matter how complex the conditions, they can share weal and woe with the masses of the people and struggle hard. Wherever the Party puts them, they take root there, blossom, and make contributions to the revolution. Where does our happiness come from today? Where does victory come from? Isn't it created by the revolutionary predecessors under the leadership of the Party? What sturdy revolutionary seeds they are! What seeds can be more vital than them?
    Today, for the thousands of young people who go to the countryside, it is even more cordial and important to review Chairman Mao's teachings and learn from the example of the revolutionary predecessors.
    The Party is the sunshine and rain; the masses of the people are the fertile soil. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, the younger generation will take deep root among the masses of the people, and they will surely blossom brightly and bear abundant fruit.
    However, when it comes to sowing, the important issue is "being mentally prepared." What is mental preparation? That is: revolutionary consciousness, lofty ideals. Thousands of outstanding young people have made great ambitions, love agricultural labor, do not avoid dangers, fight bravely, do not set conditions, do not count on rewards, and are determined to change the "poor and blank" face of the countryside with their own hands. They regard engaging in agricultural labor, developing agricultural production, and building rural people's communes as a glorious and heroic cause, and consciously dedicate their strength and wisdom to it. At the same time, they also regard the countryside as a melting pot for tempering revolutionary will, as a school for learning production knowledge, and are determined to combine mental labor with physical labor, combine book knowledge with production practice, lay a good foundation, grow branches, and become revolutionary youth who are both red and expert. In a word, the younger generation is determined to blossom in the land of the motherland, bear sweet fruit, and is determined to build the rural people's communes well, and is determined to realize the communist ideal in every inch of our land. This is a lofty mental preparation. Revolutionary ideals, revolutionary will, nurture revolutionary seeds, and the powerful vitality of those seeds lies here.
    Thousands upon thousands of revolutionary seeds full of unlimited vitality are always strong and invincible. No matter how difficult the natural environment, no matter how complex the climate change, the wind cannot blow them down, and the water cannot wash them away. Wherever they are sown, they take root, blossom, and bear fruit. Look, haven't some of those young seeds already taken root, some have already blossomed, and some have already borne fruit?
    Xing Yanzi in Hebei has blossomed on saline-alkali land; Luo Liansheng in Hunan has blossomed in the mountains; Lü Genze in Jilin has blossomed in the rice fields on the banks of the Hailan River; Cui Fusheng in Henan has blossomed on the barren hills of the Taihang Mountains; Qin Bichao and Liu Yujin in Guizhou have blossomed on barren land; Wang Deyu, Wang Suqin and other twenty young cadres in Shandong have blossomed in a poor production team; the eight female heroes in Fujian have blossomed on a deserted island.... Tens of thousands of young people are taking root, blossoming, and bearing fruit in the vast countryside.
    Revolutionary seeds have taken root and sprouted! Revolutionary ideals have blossomed and borne fruit! Communist seeds are sown, and the future will surely be a brilliant world. We cheer for the thousands of revolutionary seeds. We cheer for those blooming and soon-to-bloom revolutionary flowers of all colors.

### 在农村中生根、开花

    在农村中生根、开花
    林旭
    秋天，是收获的季节。收获，是令人喜悦的。然而，没有播种，就无所谓收获；没有种子在土地中生根、开花，就无从结出丰硕的果实。于是，我常想，种子的作用太可贵了。
    一粒种子落了下去，青葱的禾苗长了起来；一棵幼苗栽种下去，参天的大树生长起来。有种子的地方，总是蓬蓬勃勃，布满着生机。天下百花百禾，千草万木，都离不开种子。千里原野是怎样飘起稻花香的？荒山秃岭是怎样变成花果山的？无垠的沙漠是怎样变成一片绿洲的？原因之一，还不是有了种子。种子，给大地带来了活力；种子，给人类带来了收获和希望。
    种子的生命力是如此旺盛。只要有了阳光、雨露和土壤，种子就会茁壮地生长起来，生根，发芽，开花，结果。无论是在高山峻岭或是平原，无论是在肥沃的田野或是贫瘠的土地，也无论是在严寒的冬季或是酷热的夏天，大地上总是有种子在生长着。种子，从泥土里、从石缝里欢笑着抬起头来迎着太阳生长，千千万万粒种子随时随地在改变着大自然的面貌。
  因为这样，人们对于种子从生根到结果，给予了无微不至地照料和爱护。
    我想，革命青年和革命干部的成长也和种子一样。
    从报纸上读到一则令人喜悦的消息：全国已有六百多万知识青年走上农业生产第一线，到农村中扎根。那消息说：“党的大办农业，大办粮食的动员令，好比春风一样霎时吹遍了祖国的大地。在大江南北、长城内外，从城市到镇集，从工厂到学校，从商店到机关，走出了一队队、一支支挎背包、戴红花，精神焕发、热情洋溢的年轻人，他们向农村的广阔天地走去，决心要为建设社会主义、实现共产主义在农村干一辈子。”
    六百多万名青年到农村去了！六百多万粒种子播种到土地里去了！看到这些，人们的心情要比看到任何播种更为喜悦。因为，这不是平常的播种，这不是一般的种子，这是革命的壮举，建设的壮举，这是革命的种子，建设的种子。对于这样的种子，人们寄予的希望自然是大得多，心里的喜悦自然也是说不尽的。
    1945年，由于革命的需要，许多同志从延安到前方去工作。毛主席教导这些同志说：“所有到前方去的同志，都应当做好精神准备，准备到了那里，就要生根、开花，结果。我们共产党人好比种子，人民好比土地。我们到了一个地方，就要同那里的人民结合起来，在人民中间生根、开花。”
    多少年来，无数的革命干部正是遵循着毛主席所教导的那样，在人民中间扎下了根子，开出了花朵，结出了果实。他们不怕任何困难，不惧任何风险，不管在多么艰苦的环境中，不管在多么复杂的条件下，都能和人民群众同甘共苦，艰苦奋斗。党把他们放到哪里，他们就在哪里扎下根去，开出花来，为革命作出贡献。我们今天的幸福从哪里来？胜利从哪里来？还不是革命前辈在党的领导下创造出来的吗？那是一些多么茁壮的革命种子！有什么种子能够比他们更具有强大的生命力呢？
    今天，对于到农村去的千千万万青年来说，重温毛主席的教导，学习革命前辈的榜样，更加感到亲切和重要。
    党，是阳光，是雨露；人民群众，是肥沃的土壤。青年一代在党的教育和培养下，到人民群众中去扎下深根，那就一定会开出鲜艳的花朵，结出丰硕的果实来。
    然而，要播种了，重要的问题在于“做好精神准备”。什么是精神准备？那就是：革命的觉悟，崇高的理想。千百万优秀的青年立下雄心宏愿，热爱农业劳动，不避艰险，英勇奋斗，不讲条件，不计报酬，决心用自己的双手改变农村“一穷二白”的面貌。他们把从事农业劳动，发展农业生产，建设农村人民公社看作是光荣豪迈的事业，自觉地为它献出自己的力量和智慧。同时，他们也把农村看作锻炼革命意志的熔炉，看作学习生产知识的学校，决心把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来，把书本知识和生产实践结合起来，把根基打好，把枝干长成，作一个又红又专的革命青年。一句话，青年一代决心要在祖国的大地上开出鲜花，结出甜果，决心要把农村人民公社建设好，决心要在我国每一寸土地上实现共产主义的理想。这是一种崇高的精神准备。革命的理想，革命的意志，哺育着革命的种子，那种子强大的生命力就在这里。
    千千万万粒充满无限生命力的革命种子，永远是茁壮无敌的。不管自然环境多么困难，不管气候变化多么复杂，风吹不倒它们，水冲不垮它们。从哪里把它们撒播下去，它们就在哪里生出根来，开出花来，结出果来。请看，那一粒粒幼小的种子，不是有的已经扎下根，有的已经开出花，有的已经结出果子来了吗？
    河北的邢燕子在盐碱土地上开花了；湖南的罗连生在万山丛中开花了；吉林的吕根泽在海兰江畔的稻田里开花了；河南的崔复生在太行山的荒山秃岭上开花了；贵州的秦必超、刘禹金在贫瘠的土地上开花了；山东的王德玉、王素琴等二十名青年干部在一个穷困的生产队里开花了；福建的八位女英雄在荒无人烟的海岛上开花了……。成千上万的青年正在农村的广阔天地里生根、开花、结果。
    革命的种子生根了，发芽了！革命的理想开花了，结果了！共产主义的种子播下去，来日定是一个灿烂的世界。我们为千千万万粒革命的种子欢呼。我们为那些已经开放和将要开放的万紫千红革命花朵欢呼。
