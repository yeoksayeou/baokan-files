Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 13th. The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published a commentary on the 12th regarding the North Korean government's memorandum on the peaceful reunification of Korea, stating: "The Albanian people value and support the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to reunify their fatherland peacefully. We welcome and fully endorse the new peace initiatives. From the memorandum of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, our people see the correct path to resolving the Korean issue. It is in the interests of the Korean people and also in the interests of maintaining peace and security in the Far East." The commentary condemned the discussion of the Korean question in the UN General Assembly. The commentary pointed out that the aim of imperialism is to distort the true situation in Korea in the face of world opinion and to cover up their aggressive policies. The Korean government's memorandum correctly emphasizes that the Korean question should not be discussed in the United Nations because it is a matter to be resolved by the Korean people themselves and does not allow foreign interference. The commentary exposed with specific facts that U.S. imperialism and the South Korean puppet clique have been undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement for seven years and turning South Korea into a base of aggression against North Korea and China. The commentary pointed out that this is the main obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The commentary pointed out that the Korean government's memorandum sets out specific and realistic proposals, the most necessary of which is the withdrawal of U.S. occupation troops from South Korea.

The Albanian "Unity" newspaper also published a commentary on this issue, supporting the constructive suggestions of the North Korean government. The commentary said that the Korean government's memorandum is another very important document that strongly exposes the U.S. aggressive bloc's attempt to distort the true situation in Korea in the United Nations. It clearly states the realistic path to create conditions for bringing the North and South parts of Korea closer together and peacefully reunifying the two parts.

The commentary emphasized that the question of peaceful reunification of the whole of Korea can only be a matter for the Korean people; it is a domestic affair that can and must be resolved by the Korean people themselves. Under no circumstances does the Korean question need to be discussed in the United Nations, as this is direct interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸支持朝鲜政府备忘录
    美帝国主义是朝鲜和平统一的主要障碍
    朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己解决不需要联合国讨论
    新华社地拉那13日电　阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”12日就朝鲜政府关于朝鲜和平统一的备忘录发表评论说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民重视并支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以和平方式统一祖国的努力。我们欢迎和完全赞同新的和平倡议。从朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的备忘录中，我国人民看到了解决朝鲜问题的正确道路。它符合朝鲜人民的利益，也符合维护远东和平和安全的利益。”评论谴责在联大讨论朝鲜问题。评论指出，帝国主义的目的是企图在世界舆论面前歪曲朝鲜的真实情况，掩盖他们的侵略政策。朝鲜政府的备忘录完全正确地强调指出，朝鲜问题不应在联合国中讨论，因为它是要由朝鲜人民自己解决的问题，不容外国干涉。评论以具体事实揭露了美帝国主义和南朝鲜傀儡集团七年来破坏朝鲜停战协定并使南朝鲜成为反对朝中两国的侵略基地。评论指出，这就是和平统一朝鲜的主要障碍。
    评论指出，朝鲜政府的备忘录阐述了具体而现实的建议，其中最必要的就是从南朝鲜撤出美国占领军。
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”也就此问题发表了评论，支持朝鲜政府的建设性建议。评论说，朝鲜政府的备忘录是有力地揭露美国侵略集团企图在联合国歪曲朝鲜的真实情况的另一个非常重要的文件。它明确地阐述了为使朝鲜南北两部接近而创造条件和和平统一两个部分的现实道路。
    评论着重指出，和平统一全朝鲜的问题只能是朝鲜人民的问题，它是一个内政问题，只能和必须由朝鲜人民自己来解决。在任何情况下朝鲜问题都不需要在联合国讨论，因为这是对朝鲜人民内政的直接干涉。
