Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 11th: The Gao Nan Production Team of the Shange Commune in Pinghe County, Fujian Province, conscientiously implemented the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" policy, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of each production team and its members. The winter planting area, yield targets, labor arrangements, and fertilizer and seed preparations were quickly implemented, and a high tide of competition for exceeding area, exceeding yield per unit area, and exceeding total output in winter planting was launched throughout the team.

    When focusing on the field management of late rice, the Gao Nan Brigade Party Branch conscientiously summarized past experiences of planting more and harvesting more, and achieving high yields and harvesting more. It formulated a plan to expand this year's winter planting area from 844 mu last year to 1,730 mu. Subsequently, in conjunction with promoting large-scale agriculture and large-scale grain production, the team immediately and conscientiously implemented the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" policy, mobilizing the masses to discuss winter planting "three guarantees" targets. When discussing production targets, everyone referred to the actual output of the previous year, classifying winter planting land into different categories according to different crops, and then discussed them plot by plot, following the spirit of being positive and reliable, leaving room for improvement, and having output to exceed. After the targets were set from the bottom up and researched and adjusted from the top down, the entire team finally adopted this year's winter planting production targets. At the same time, according to different land and different crops, labor quotas were formulated, different work point targets were determined, and different cost targets were set in accordance with the requirements of increased production measures and the spirit of diligence and thrift, and they were guaranteed to the team.

    After the winter planting "three guarantees" targets were determined, in order to ensure the realization of the targets, Gao Nan Brigade and each team made several guarantees to each other. Among them, the brigade's guarantees to the teams were five: First, implement "four fixings," that is, fix each team's land, labor, cattle, and farm tools, so that each team can use its own land, labor, cattle, and farm tools under the unified leadership of the brigade. In special circumstances, they can only be transferred with the consent of the team. Second, most of the over-production part of the team's winter crops will be determined to belong to the team as an over-production reward, and a small part will be turned over to the brigade as funds for expanding production. In the over-production reward, cash is mainly rewarded, and a certain amount of physical objects are also appropriately rewarded. Third, the team's intercropping and interplanting of grain, oil crops, or other winter crops in gaps around houses and fields, etc., are not included in the "three guarantees" and are all handled by the team itself. Fourth, the seeds and some commercial fertilizers supplied by the brigade are guaranteed to be allocated to each contracted team in quality and quantity ten to fifteen days before sowing. Fifth, brigade cadres adopt a method of dividing areas and contracting, going to each team to be "four togethers" with the team members, participating in production, leading production, and jointly ensuring the completion of the "three guarantees" targets. On the team side, they guarantee that the planned area for winter planting is implemented in the fields, and the task of winter planting area is completed; fertilizers are implemented in the fields; labor is arranged reasonably, and the winter planting task is completed in a timely manner; and that they manage the planting, and implement a field management responsibility system.

    After the winter planting "three guarantees" targets were implemented, the production enthusiasm of the teams and members was greatly boosted. The teams successively launched a warm "three exceed" competition for exceeding area, exceeding yield per unit area, and exceeding total output in winter planting, not only implementing the winter planting area and labor arrangements in the fields and to individuals, but also trying every means to expand the winter planting area. After implementing the winter planting area, teams such as Xipu also made full use of the gaps around houses and fields to intercrop overwintering sweet potatoes, radishes, and other small grains and vegetables. In addition to trying to expand the planting area as much as possible, the teams also focused on increasing the yield per unit area, striving to exceed the guaranteed (total output) target. The brigade also actively supported the teams in preparing for winter planting, and the brigade cadres also decided to plant eighteen mu of high-yield wheat demonstration fields in each team, strengthen leadership in the over-target movement, and strive for a better harvest next spring than in any previous year.

    善于把党的政策变为群众行动
    高南生产队在冬种中充分发动群众讨论执行三包一奖办法
    据新华社福州11日电　福建平和县山格公社高南大队认真贯彻
  “三包一奖”政策，进一步调动了各生产小队和社员的积极性，冬种面积、产量指标、劳力安排和肥料、种籽准备工作迅速落实，全大队掀起了冬种超面积、超单产、超总产的竞赛高潮。
    高南大队党支部在狠抓晚稻田间管理的时候，就认真总结过去多种多收和高产多收的经验，订出了把今年冬种面积从去年的八百四十四亩扩大到一千七百三十亩的规划。随后，结合宣传大办农业、大办粮食，立即认真贯彻“三包一奖”政策，发动群众讨论冬种“三包”指标。在讨论包产指标时，大家参照上年的实际产量，把冬种田地按不同作物分类划片，然后根据积极可靠、留有余地、有产可超的精神，逐丘逐片地讨论。经过自下而上的订指标和自上而下的研究调整，最后全队通过了今年冬种的包产指标，同时根据不同土地、不同作物，制定劳动定额、确定不同包工指标，又按增产措施的要求和勤俭经营的精神，确定不同的成本指标，包实到队。
    冬种“三包”指标确定后，为了确保指标的实现，高南大队和各小队之间互相订了几条保证。其中大队向小队的保证有五条：一、实行“四定”，即把各小队的土地、劳力、耕牛和农具固定下来，使各小队在大队统一领导下，固定使用本小队的土地、劳力、耕牛、农具，如遇特殊情况，经过小队同意才能调动。二、小队冬种作物的超产部分，确定大部分归小队作为超产奖励，小部分上交大队作为扩大生产资金。在超产奖励中，主要奖励现金，同时适当奖励一部分实物。三、小队利用四旁、十边等隙地套种、间种粮油作物或其他冬种作物，不列入“三包”范围，全部归小队自己处理。四、大队负责供应的种籽和部分商品肥，保证在播种前十天到十五天之间，保质保量地拨到各包产小队。五、大队干部采取分片包干办法，分头与各小队社员“四同”，参加生产、领导生产，共同保证完成“三包”指标。在小队方面，保证作到冬种计划面积落实到田，完成冬种面积任务；肥料落实到田；合理安排劳力，适时完成冬种任务；并且一种就管，实行田间管理责任制。
    冬种“三包”指标落实后，大大鼓舞了小队和社员的生产积极性。各小队相继热烈开展了冬种超面积、超单产、超总产的“三超”竞赛，不但把冬种面积、劳力安排等落实到田，落实到人，而且千方百计地扩大冬种面积。溪埔等小队在落实冬种面积后，又充分利用四旁、十边隙地套种、间种越冬甘薯、萝卜等小杂粮和蔬菜。各小队除了尽量扩种外，还大抓提高单位面积产量的措施，力争超过包产（总产量）指标。大队也积极支援各小队进行冬种准备，大队干部还确定到各小队种植十八亩小麦丰产指挥田，加强领导超包产运动，力争明年春季有一个比过去任何一年都好的收成。
