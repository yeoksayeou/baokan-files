(Qingdao Daily) Qingdao Vehicle Factory workers are actively increasing the production of handcarts and other products to support agriculture. From January to October, the factory's production of handcarts increased approximately two and a half times compared to the same period last year.

In order to increase handcart production, factory-level and workshop-level leaders personally went to the production front line, focusing on ideology, grasping key points, and managing plans by shift and by day, making political and ideological work and enterprise management work more detailed. To ensure that product parts meet matching requirements, each workshop generally mobilized workers before the 25th of each month to summarize and inspect the month's production, discuss and formulate the next month's plan, so that the next month's plan would be implemented down to groups and individuals by the end of each month. After the plan was arranged, the workshop began to manage the plan by shift from the beginning of the month, and the factory level checked daily and every ten days, promptly balancing production, and striving to avoid plan arrears and the phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month.

The factory's Party committee launched counterpart competitions between work teams and individuals, as well as one-stop competitions between upper and lower processes, and regularly evaluated and summarized experiences to promote the continuous and in-depth development of the competition. In the competition, the workers chased each other and strived to be the best. For example, in mid-October one day, the Drilling Strip Hat C class of the Fourth Workshop, which had always been in the lead, set a workshop record with a shift output of 208 jin. The workers in Class B quickly caught up, held a pre-shift meeting, learned the experience of Class C, and broke the record that day with a shift output of 218 jin.

    青岛车辆厂上下一心支援农业
    手推车比去年同期增产两倍半
    本报讯　据青岛日报消息：青岛车辆厂职工积极增产手推车等产品支援农业。从1月到10月，全厂生产的手推车比去年同期增加约两倍半。
    为了增产手推车，这个厂厂级和车间的领导干部亲临生产第一线，抓思想，抓关键，按班、按日抓计划，使政治思想工作和企业管理工作越做越细。各车间为了确保产品零件适应配套要求，一般都在每月25日前发动职工总结检查当月生产，讨论制订下月计划，使下月计划在每月月底就落实到小组和个人。计划安排以后，车间从月初就开始按班抓计划，厂级按日、按旬检查，及时平衡生产，尽量做到计划不拖欠和避免月初松、月底紧的现象。
    这个厂的党委发动职工开展了班组和个人的对口对手赛，以及上下工序的一条龙竞赛，并按时评比总结经验，推动竞赛不断深入发展。在竞赛中，职工们你追我赶，力争上游。如10月中旬有一天，四车间一向领先的钻条帽丙班以班产二百零八斤的成绩创车间最高纪录，乙班职工急起直追，召开班前会，学习了丙班的经验，当天就以班产二百一十八斤的成绩刷新了纪录。
