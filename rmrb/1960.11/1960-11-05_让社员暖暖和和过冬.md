　　Let Commune Members Spend the Winter Warmly
　　"Start of Winter" is approaching. Snow has already begun to fall in some cold regions of the north. More work needs to be done on arranging the lives of commune members in winter than in other seasons. For example, the issue of staying warm is unique to this season. This year, certain regions have suffered considerable natural disasters, bringing certain difficulties to the lives of the people. In such areas, special attention should be paid to arranging life so that commune members can eat hot food and live in warm housing, spending the winter warmly.
　　In the arrangement of commune members' winter lives, in addition to the planning of grain use, the storage of winter vegetables, etc., which must be earnestly implemented, an important task at present is to seize the opportunity to prepare fuel for heating public canteens and commune members' homes. The most important and effective method for solving the fuel problem is to organize and mobilize commune members to collect firewood from the mountains, cut wild grass, and gather up the stalks of farm crops.
　　Collecting firewood and grass to store fuel is by no means a trivial matter. It is a major issue related to the safety of the vast number of commune members in eating, heating, and surviving the entire winter. The Party organizations of the communes and production teams must care about and earnestly lead this matter. In addition to arranging a certain amount of labor to collect firewood and grass, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to take action, everyone doing their part. "Bring a knife when you go out, carry a load back after work." This method of cutting firewood and storing grass in spare time should be greatly promoted.
　　After the completion of the "Three Autumns" work, it is necessary to arrange a certain amount of time to organize commune members to collect fuel in a concentrated effort. With regular collection plus short-term concentrated efforts, the problem of fuel for commune members' winter heating can be effectively solved.

    让社员暖暖和和过冬
    立冬就要到了。北方某些寒冷的地区已经开始降雪。在社员生活的安排上，冬季要作更多的工作。像御寒问题，就是别的季节所没有的。今年某些地区遭受了相当严重的自然灾害，给人民的生活带来了一定的困难。在这样的地区，要特别注意安排生活，让社员都能吃热住暖，暖暖和和地过冬。
    对社员冬季生活的安排，除了计划用粮、储备冬菜等等要切实落实之外，当前很重要的一项工作，就是抓紧时机，准备公共食堂和社员家庭取暖用的燃料。解决燃料问题的最主要最有效的方法，是组织和发动社员打山柴、割野草和收净农作物的秸秆。
    打柴、割草储备燃料，这绝不是一件可有可无的小事，而是关系到广大社员在整个冬季吃饭、取暖安全过冬的一件大事。公社和生产队的党组织要关心和认真领导这件事情，除了安排一定的劳力打柴割草，还要发动群众，人人动手。“出门带上一把刀，收工回来担一挑。”这种利用业余时间砍柴、储草的办法，应该大加提倡。
    在“三秋”工作结束以后，安排一定的时间，组织社员突击收集燃料，是必要的。经常的收集加上短期的突击，社员冬季取暖的燃料问题，就可能得到切实的解决了。
