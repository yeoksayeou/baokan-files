Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 11th: The United States, manipulating the United Nations General Assembly Credentials Committee, yesterday passed a US-proposed resolution on the representation of the Congo in the United Nations. This proposal recommends that the United Nations General Assembly approve a group of people appointed by Kasavubu as the legitimate representatives of the Congo to the United Nations General Assembly, while disregarding the delegation appointed by the legitimate government of Prime Minister Lumumba, which is supported by the Congolese Parliament.

The United States' conspiracy to force the committee to make this one-sided and illegal decision was opposed by representatives from the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, and Morocco.

The Soviet delegation issued a statement on the 9th after the committee meeting, pointing out that the US delegation's hasty attempt to pass a resolution in the Credentials Committee confirming a group of people designated by Kasavubu as representatives of the Republic of the Congo to the UN once again exposes its desire to continue interfering in the internal affairs of the Congo, thereby imposing a colonialist puppet, anti-democratic regime on the Congolese people under the guise of the United Nations. The statement pointed out that although the seat of the Congo representative should logically belong to the delegation sent by the country's legitimate government, this issue has not been resolved in the Security Council, the UN General Assembly emergency session, and this session of the General Assembly. Now that the issue of the situation in the Congo has been placed on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States, disregarding the protests of many delegations, wants to forcibly pass the acceptance of a group of people designated by Kasavubu as representatives of the Republic of the Congo. The Chairman of the Committee, the representative of New Zealand, even attempted to deprive the Soviet representative of the right to speak and immediately put the American proposal to a vote. Soviet representative Zorin spoke twice at the meeting. He said that the Soviet delegation supports the proposal of the United Arab Republic and Morocco to postpone the discussion of the issue of the Congo's representation in the United Nations until the situation in the country is clarified. He said that the US delegation recently refused to discuss the credentials of the Congo's legitimate government at the United Nations, but now it is showing surprising enthusiasm, with the aim of hastily confirming the credentials of its capable figures. He also emphasized that the US proposal contradicts the resolution of the General Assembly's plenary meeting on the Congo issue on the 9th. (The United Nations General Assembly plenary meeting decided on the 9th to suspend the debate on the Congo issue, pending the report of the mediation committee of fifteen Asian and African countries). The Soviet representative believes that the US representative's approach is an attempt to pre-conclude the decision of the General Assembly, and legalize an anti-people regime that suits the American appetite in the Congo.

The Soviet representative pointed out that the United States' current practice is an attempt to deprive the Congolese people's representatives of the right to participate in the work of the United Nations. He said that the United States sympathizes with the traitorous Mobutu regime because Mobutu once expressed his agreement to follow the path of Western colonialist countries. The United States now wants to strengthen the position of its puppet in the Congo through the United Nations.

Zorin reiterated that the United Nations cannot ignore the decisions of Lumumba's legitimate government, because these decisions reflect the will and aspirations of the Congolese people.

The Moroccan representative pointed out that passing the US proposal would violate the resolution passed by the General Assembly on the 9th.

Representatives from the Philippines, Spain, and Costa Rica spoke in support of the US proposal. The Chairman of the Committee, disregarding the opposition of the representatives of the Soviet Union, Morocco, and the United Arab Republic, put the US proposal to a vote. The following voted in favor: the United States, Haiti, Spain, the Philippines, New Zealand, and Costa Rica. The Soviet delegation voted against, and the delegations of the United Arab Republic and Morocco did not participate in the vote.

### 美国操纵联大资格审查委员会通过提案  卡萨武布窃据刚果在联大席位

    美国操纵联大资格审查委员会通过提案
    卡萨武布窃据刚果在联大席位
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：美国操纵联合国大会资格审查委员会昨天通过了美国提出的一项关于刚果在联合国的代表权的提案，这项提案建议联合国大会批准由卡萨武布任命的一批人作为刚果出席联合国大会的合法代表，而把受到刚果议会支持的卢蒙巴总理的合法政府所任命的代表团撇开。
    美国代表强迫委员会作出这一片面的非法决定的阴谋遭到苏联、阿拉伯联合共和国和摩洛哥代表的反对。
    苏联代表团9日在委员会会议后发表声明指出，美国代表团匆匆忙忙地企图在资格审查委员会通过确认卡萨武布指派的一批人为刚果共和国出席联大的代表的决议，再次暴露了它想继续干涉刚果的内政，从而在联合国旗帜的掩盖下把殖民主义者傀儡的反民主的政权强加给刚果人民。声明指出，虽然刚果代表的席位按通理应该属于这个国家的合法政府派出的代表团，但是这个问题在安全理事会、联合国大会紧急会议和本届大会上却没有解决。现在关于刚果局势问题已列入联合国大会议程，美国却不顾许多代表团的抗议，想在现在强行通过接纳卡萨武布指派的一批人为刚果共和国的代表。阿联和摩洛哥代表团在委员会上发表声明说，必须把关于刚果代表权问题的讨论延期至这个国家的局势澄清以后。但是，美国代表继续坚持在委员会中立即讨论这个问题。委员会主席，新西兰代表甚至曾企图剥夺苏联代表的发言权，并立即把美国的建议交付表决。苏联代表佐林在会上两次发言。他说，苏联代表团支持阿联和摩洛哥关于延期讨论刚果在联合国代表权问题的建议。他说，美国代表团不久以前拒绝讨论刚果合法政府在联合国的代表全权问题，而现在却表现出惊人的热心，目的无非是要匆忙地肯定它的得力人物的全权。他还着重指出，美国的建议是同大会9日全体会议关于刚果问题的决议抵触的。（联合国大会全体会议9日决定暂停关于刚果问题的辩论，以等待亚非十五国派往刚果的调解委员会的报告）。苏联代表认为美国代表的这种手法是企图给大会的决定预先下结论，使符合美国胃口的反人民制度在刚果合法化。
    苏联代表指出，美国现在的做法是企图剥夺刚果人民代表参加联合国的工作权利。他说，美国同情卖国贼蒙博托的政权，因为蒙博托曾经表示同意走西方殖民主义国家的道路。美国现在想通过联合国来加强它在刚果的傀儡的地位。
    佐林再次强调指出，联合国不能忽视卢蒙巴的合法政府的决定，因为这些决定反映了刚果人民的意志和愿望。
    摩洛哥代表发言指出，通过美国的建议将违背大会9日通过的决议。
    菲律宾、西班牙和哥斯达黎加的代表发言支持美国提案。委员会主席不顾苏联、摩洛哥、阿联代表的反对，把美国提案交付表决。投票赞成的有：美国、海地、西班牙、菲律宾、新西兰、哥斯达黎加。苏联代表团投票反对，阿联和摩洛哥代表团没有参加投票。
