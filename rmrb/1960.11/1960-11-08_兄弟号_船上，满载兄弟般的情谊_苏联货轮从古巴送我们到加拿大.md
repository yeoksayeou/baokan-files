　　On the "Brotherhood" Ship, Filled with Brotherly Affection
　　——Soviet Freighter Takes Us from Cuba to Canada
　　Cao Yuhua

    The Chinese Art Troupe successfully concluded its friendly visit and performances in Latin America. According to the plan, it was to participate in the Vancouver International Drama Festival in Canada and conduct a visit and performance tour in various parts of Canada. However, how to get from Cuba to Canada? We encountered some transportation difficulties.

    Geographically, the United States lay in our path. At the same time, in terms of transportation, whether by sea or air, we had to pass through the United States. Because American imperialism was sworn to be an enemy of the Chinese people, they did everything possible to obstruct our meeting with the Canadian people.

    At this moment, the Soviet elder brother extended a hand of friendship to us. They agreed to use a Soviet freighter that was loading Cuban sugar in Havana to take us directly to Canada.

    In those days, the people of Cuba looked with gratitude at the Soviet freighters docked in the port of Havana. In the eyes of the Cuban people, the Soviet flag with the red star and hammer and sickle fluttering on the ships looked particularly bright. In particular, as American imperialism tried to strangle the Cuban economy through the oil issue, people were enthusiastically talking about Soviet ships carrying crude oil to support Cuba, arriving at the ports of Santiago and Havana. American imperialism reduced the quota for purchasing Cuban sugar, while the Soviet Union promised to immediately purchase the Cuban sugar that the US had refused to buy, as support for Cuba. This generous act moved the Cuban people even more. Among the Soviet ships that the Cuban people were paying close attention to, there was a ship called "Brotherhood," which was loading Cuban sugar and preparing to return to the Soviet Union. The Soviet commercial representative in Cuba had this ship detour to take us to a Canadian port first, and then return home.

    When all the comrades of our art troupe heard this news, we felt indescribable excitement and gratitude.

    On the morning of July 28th, as the sun just appeared, the "Brotherhood," fully loaded with Cuban sugar and all members of the Chinese Art Troupe, and filled with the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, slowly set sail.

    We bid farewell to the enthusiastic, brave, and fighting Cuban people, and to beautiful Cuba. For more than a month, we had forged a deep friendship with the Cuban people. How reluctant we were to leave them! The ship braved the waves of the Atlantic Ocean, advancing against the wind.

    The "Brotherhood" was a freighter. As soon as we stepped into the cabins, we immediately found them clean and tidy, with white sheets on each bed. Later, we learned that the Soviet comrades on the "Brotherhood" had been busy for several days preparing to receive us. The crew gave up half of their rooms for us, the sheets were laundered as if they were new, and they bought a large quantity of fruits, fish, meat, rice, and flour for us to eat on the ship. Even the meal and rest times were arranged for us. Thus, we began our life on the ship.

    Every morning, we joined the Soviet comrades in cleaning the environment on the deck; but the Soviet comrades always stopped us from doing it. Some comrades peeled potatoes on the deck, preparing the meals for the day, and everyone chatted and laughed. In the kitchen, our comrades cooperated with the Soviet cooks to make delicious meals for everyone. During the short few days on the ship, we tasted the flavors of home that we had not tasted for months.

    In the evening, under the dark ocean and the twinkling stars, we watched films brought from our motherland and Soviet films from the ship with the Soviet comrades on the deck. From the films of our motherland, we relived the happy life of the People's Commune, and the soaring enthusiasm of the people of the motherland once again inspired us. Many comrades had already seen the Soviet film "Whirlwind of Hate" in Beijing, but the Soviet people and Dzerzhinsky's resolute and decisive image in fighting the class enemies once again encouraged us.

    When we slept at night, we used lifebuoys as pillows—like the sailors on the ship, each of us was given a lifebuoy.

    The ship was filled with brotherly friendship, and we felt like we were living in our own home.

    The wind was gentle and the sun was warm, and the sea was so calm. During those times, the deck became our stage, and the comrades of our dance troupe rehearsed on the deck. It was a vast world, allowing us to sing and dance freely.

    On July 31st, the weather was clear, and the blue ocean was extremely beautiful. We were practicing when we suddenly discovered an airplane flying from the northwest direction of the ship's course, and it swooped down several times, passing over the ship, flying so low that it almost touched the chimney. We clearly saw that it was an American naval aircraft. Obviously, this was a provocation against us. But how could a paper tiger scare us? People could not suppress the anger in their hearts towards this crime of imperialism, and comrades with cameras took pictures to "preserve the evidence."

    On the afternoon of the 31st, as the ship was passing through the outer sea of New York Harbor, we held a get-together on the ship. All members of the art troupe and all Soviet crew members sang the song "Moscow-Beijing," which is familiar to the people of China and the Soviet Union. The singing echoed, breaking through the turbulent Atlantic Ocean, singing the brotherly friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and singing the voice of the people of the world defending peace.

    The ship continued to move forward, and the captain kept looking forward from the command platform, directing the navigation. The captain's assistant said at the get-together: "Our entire crew will complete this mission of transporting the Chinese Art Troupe to Canada as a glorious task. We wish you success in your work, your victory is our victory." His speech was warmly welcomed by all our comrades. Chen Zhongjing, the head of the delegation, thanked the "Brotherhood" on behalf of everyone for its brotherly selfless help to us, and wished the "Brotherhood" ship to always ride the wind and waves and have a smooth journey. We also gave souvenirs to every Soviet comrade on the ship.

    August 1st was our Army Day. In the afternoon, we arrived at the port of Halifax in eastern Canada. According to local newspapers, the Soviet "Brotherhood" was the first Soviet ship to come to this port in many years, and this time it carried the Chinese Art Troupe. The Soviet ship overcame various difficulties and made its first voyage on this route, taking us from a distant place to our destination. Such deep friendship made us very grateful; at the same time, it shattered the conspiracy of American imperialism to obstruct us from promoting cultural exchanges and friendly exchanges among the people of all countries.

    This incident reminded me of a similar incident when the Chinese Art Troupe visited and performed in Japan in 1958. At that time, it was precisely when the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan was undermining the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and creating incidents of tearing up the Chinese national flag. In order to express our protest, the Chinese Art Troupe urgently needed to return to China quickly, but there were also traffic and safety issues. That time, it was also a Soviet freighter that specifically sailed to Japan to take all our personnel and the Chinese trade delegation and the Chinese legal delegation to Nakhodka port in the Soviet Union, and then safely took the train back to the motherland.

    The "Brotherhood" ship stayed at the Halifax pier for one night, waiting for us to disembark, and then they began their long voyage back home. Comrades took pictures on the ship to commemorate the occasion, and were reluctant to part.

    The ship started, and we waved non-stop on the shore, wishing the "Brotherhood" ship and the Soviet brothers well.

### “兄弟号”船上，满载兄弟般的情谊——苏联货轮从古巴送我们到加拿大

    “兄弟号”船上，满载兄弟般的情谊
    ——苏联货轮从古巴送我们到加拿大
    曹育华
    中国艺术团胜利地结束了在拉丁美洲的友好访问演出，按照计划要到加拿大参加温哥华国际戏剧节的表演，并在加拿大各地进行访问演出。但是，怎样从古巴到加拿大去呢？我们遇到了交通上的一些困难。
    从地理上说，横摆在我们面前的是美国，同时从交通上说，无论水路和航空，中途都必须经过美国。由于美帝国主义誓与中国人民为敌，他们百般阻挠我们同加拿大人民的见面。
    正在这个时候，苏联老大哥向我们伸出了友谊之手，他们答应用正在哈瓦那装运古巴糖的苏联货船，把我们直接送到加拿大去。
    那些天，全古巴的人民，都用充满感激的眼光注意停泊在哈瓦那港口的几艘苏联货船。在古巴人民的眼中，船上飘扬着的带有五角红星和铁锤镰刀的苏联国旗，显得格外鲜艳了。特别是美帝国主义想通过石油问题来扼杀古巴的经济，人们更是热烈地谈论着从苏联装运原油支援古巴，开到古巴的圣地亚哥和哈瓦那港口来的苏联船。美帝国主义减少购买古巴糖的限额，而苏联答应立即购进美国限购减下来的古巴糖，作为对古巴的支援，这种慷慨的义举更加感动了古巴人民。就在古巴人民非常关注的几艘苏联船中，有一艘叫“兄弟号”的船只正装运古巴糖准备驶回苏联。苏联驻古巴的商务代表，让这艘船绕道先将我们送到加拿大港口，然后再回国。
    我们艺术团的全体同志听到这个消息，真有说不出的兴奋和感激。
    7月28日清晨，太阳刚刚露面，“兄弟号”满载着古巴糖和中国艺术团的全体人员，满载着中苏两国人民的友谊，徐徐地开动了。
    我们向热情勇敢的、战斗的古巴人民，向美丽的古巴告别了。一个多月来，我们已经和古巴人民结下了深厚的友谊。多么舍不得离开他们啊。船向着波涛滚滚的大西洋乘风破浪前进。
    “兄弟号”是一艘货船。我们一踏进船舱，立即发现里面干干净净的，每张床上铺着洁白的被单，后来才知道“兄弟号”船上的苏联同志们为了接待我们忙碌了好几天。船员们为我们让出了一半房间，床单浆洗得和新的一样；还购买了大批的水果、鱼肉、米面等供给我们在船上食用。就连吃饭作息时间，也都为我们安排好了。我们就这样开始了在船上的生活。
    每天早上，我们和苏联同志一起打扫甲板上的环境卫生；但是苏联同志总是不叫我们干。有的同志在甲板上削土豆，准备一天的饭食，大家有说有笑。在厨房里，我们的同志和苏联厨师合作，为大家做可口的饭菜。在船上短短的几天中，我们吃到了几个月来没吃到的家乡味道。
    晚上，我们在漆黑的海洋和点点繁星下，同苏联同志们一起在甲板上看我们从祖国带来的影片和船上的苏联影片。从祖国的影片中，我们重温了人民公社的幸福生活，祖国人民的冲天干劲又一次激励着我们。苏联影片《仇恨的旋风》，我们许多同志已经在北京看过，但是苏联人民和捷尔任斯基那种坚决果敢地与阶级敌人斗争的形象，又一次鼓舞着我们。
    夜间睡觉的时候，我们将救生圈当作枕头——像船上的海员一样，我们每个人都发了一个救生圈。
    船上到处洋溢着兄弟般的友谊，我们就像生活在自己的家里一样。
    风和日暖，海是那么平静。那些时候，甲板成了我们的舞台，我们舞蹈队的同志就在甲板上面进行排练。真是海阔天空，任我们自由自在的唱着、跳着。
    7月31日，天气晴朗，蔚蓝色的海洋美丽极了。我们正在练功，突然发现一架飞机从船航行的西北方向飞来，并且几次俯冲下来，掠过轮船上空，飞得那样低，简直就要碰到烟囱了。我们清清楚楚地看见这是一架美国海军飞机。很明显，这是在向我们挑衅。然而纸老虎怎能吓倒我们？对帝国主义的这种罪行，人们仰止不住心头的愤怒，有照相机的同志都拍了照“立此存照”。
    就在31日的下午，轮船正通过纽约港的外海，我们在船上开了一个联欢会。艺术团的全体团员和全体苏联船员，高唱起中苏两国人民所熟悉的《莫斯科——北京》。歌声荡漾，冲破了波涛汹涌的大西洋，唱出了中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊，唱出全世界人民保卫和平的心声。
    船继续向前挺进，船长一直在指挥台上向前了望，指挥着航行。船长助理在联欢会上说：“我们全体船员把这次运送中国艺术团到加拿大，当做一个光荣的任务来完成。祝你们工作胜利，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利。”他的发言获得我们全体同志的热烈欢迎。陈忠经团长代表大家感谢“兄弟号”对我们的兄弟般的无私帮助，并祝“兄弟号”船永远乘风破浪，一帆风顺。我们并给全船每一位苏联同志赠送了纪念品。
    8月1日是我国的建军节，下午我们到达了加拿大东部的哈里伐克斯港。据当地报刊报道，苏联“兄弟号”是许多年来苏联到这个港口来的第一艘轮船，而这一次载的还是中国艺术团。苏联轮船克服了各种困难，在这条航线上作了第一次航行，将我们从遥远的地方送到了目的地。这样深厚的友谊，使我们非常感谢；同时也粉碎了美帝国主义阻难我们促进各国人民间的文化交流和友好往来的阴谋。
    这件事情使我回忆起1958年中国艺术团在日本访问演出时遇到类似的一件事情。当时正是日本岸信介政府破坏第四次中日贸易协定和制造撕毁中国国旗的事件的时候，中国艺术团为了表示抗议，我们亟需迅速返国，但也发生交通和安全的问题。那一次也是一艘苏联货船特意开到日本来将我们全体人员和中国贸易代表团、中国法律代表团，送到苏联那浩特港口，然后平安地乘火车回到了祖国。
    “兄弟号”船在哈里伐克斯码头停了一个夜晚，等待我们上岸后，他们又开始回国的远航了。同志们纷纷在船上照像留念，舍不得分离。
    船开动了，我们在岸上不停地挥手为“兄弟号”船，为苏联兄弟祝福。
