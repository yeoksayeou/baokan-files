Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 11th: Tianjin's urban people's communes have universally established fixed connections with rural people's communes, systematically supporting agriculture in terms of manpower, technical equipment, and living services.

According to statistics, since July this year, all forty-four urban people's communes in the city, after properly arranging their own production, have organized more than 170,000 person-times to go to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor. Currently, more than 5,000 commune members regularly participate in rural labor every day. After the seven urban communes in Hedong District, such as Zhengzhuangzi and Dawangzhuang, established connections with eighteen agricultural production teams in Xinli Village Commune in the suburbs, they have organized more than 52,000 person-times to go to the countryside, helping rural areas to eliminate wasteland and plant vegetables on more than 30,000 mu. In order to ensure that the accumulated fertilizer could meet the needs of rural wheat planting and fertilization, the Zhengzhuangzi urban commune organized all the transportation tools in the commune, mobilized more than 56,000 person-times in two days, and delivered more than 620,000 jin of fertilizer to the countryside.

Urban people's communes universally adopt the method of contracting technology, supply, and repair, and delivering services to support rural people's communes. Recently, the eight urban communes in Hexi District not only supported the Xiaozhan People's Commune in the suburbs with a large number of urgently needed materials such as wire rods, sickles, fertilizers, and power equipment, but also adopted the method of assigning areas of responsibility, organizing more than 300 repair personnel to go to the countryside to repair agricultural tools. The eight urban communes in Nankai District specially organized an experienced technical team to regularly go to the countryside to repair agricultural tools and impart technology to commune members. When the vegetable field of the Wuben Production Team of the Xiaozhan People's Commune was infested with insects, the Dawangzhuang urban commune immediately organized technicians to rush to the production team to repair the damaged sprayers, and worked with the local commune members to carry out a sudden extermination of insects, quickly curbing the spread of the infestation.

Many urban people's communes send technicians, cooks, accountants, administrators, tailors, barbers, shop assistants, repairmen, etc., to the countryside to assist rural people's communes in running collective welfare undertakings and serving commune members. After the cooks and administrators of the Dongsenli People's Commune spread the experience of saving food and improving management to the Gufosi Production Team in the suburbs, the canteen of this production team could save more than 160 jin of grain and more than 500 jin of coal every day. The Zhengzhuangzi urban commune organized a novel "Bao Sanqiu Temple Fair" in the countryside, with repair service personnel going to the countryside as a complete set. Production team members went to the temple fair like going to a market to repair large and small agricultural tools, harnesses, and black and white iron work. In just one week, the repair service personnel at the temple fair repaired more than 140 pieces of various agricultural tools and harnesses, and more than 40 bicycles for the production team, while also recovering more than 14,000 jin of waste metal.

All urban people's communes in the city have recently adjusted their internal industrial production and expanded their strength to serve agriculture. In October, urban commune industries in the city produced 110 types and more than 16,000 pieces of agricultural machinery, pesticides, and fertilizers. The urban communes in Hongqiao District have systematically arranged for thirty-two types of products that are urgently needed for current agricultural production, half of which are newly added varieties recently.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 11th: The Chuanying Urban People's Commune in Jilin City regularly sends visiting delegations to rural people's communes to investigate and understand the current production needs of rural areas, and further organizes the factories under the commune to support agricultural production. From January to mid-October this year, the Chuanying Commune has helped seven rural communes establish seven small agricultural machinery repair factories; and supported the rural communes with some machine tools, motors, transformers, etc., and also trained 135 technical workers for the rural communes.

The Chuanying Commune has sent people to visit rural communes seventeen times this year. During their visits, they earnestly solicited farmers' opinions, understood the current needs of agricultural production, and then formulated a support plan. During the spring plowing season, the Chuanying Commune factories rushed to produce 500 rice transplanters and 6,000 disc harrows for the rural areas. During the summer hoeing season, the commune mobilized manpower to help rural areas weed and eliminate insects for more than 20,000 workdays. Not long ago, when the visiting delegation of the Chuanying Commune visited the Changshan People's Commune in Huadian County, they saw that the technical level of the workers in the Changshan Agricultural Commune's farm tool factory was relatively low; and learned from the symposium held with rural cadres and old farmers that the commune urgently needed autumn harvesting tools such as threshers. They took this as the center of current support for agriculture, mobilized various factories to rush to produce a batch of agricultural machinery such as threshers and sent them to the countryside, sent two technical service teams on tour to help the countryside rush to manufacture and repair autumn harvesting tools and power machinery, and at the same time organized more than 700 people to go to the countryside to help with the autumn harvest. Thirteen technicians and workers from the Chuanying Commune also settled down (for half a year) in the rural communes they were linked with to help the rural commune factories improve their technical level.

After visiting the rural areas, the Party Committee of the Chuanying People's Commune further clarified the direction of developing the urban commune's industry and other undertakings, and more firmly established the idea of serving agriculture. According to the rural situation, they formulated a plan to support agriculture, determining that the main content of supporting agriculture is to help rural communes establish and equip machinery repair factories; manufacture agricultural tools, process parts, and train technical personnel for rural communes, increase projects and products for agricultural services; and support labor, etc. Then, they adjusted and reorganized some commune-run industries, and newly built and expanded seven factories and workshops serving agriculture. The commune's bearing factory had a maximum daily output of 90 sets of bearings in the first quarter. After the visit, they felt that it could not meet the needs of the rural areas, so they expanded the bearing factory, and now the maximum daily output is more than 150 sets. In one visit, it was learned that rural communes lacked agricultural machinery repair forces, so the commune-run automobile repair factory was changed to an automobile tractor repair factory to repair agricultural machinery such as tractors and diesel engines for rural people's communes. Now, this commune has added 108 kinds of products for rural production services, including pesticides, fertilizers, white leather harnesses, and agricultural tools.

The residents of Shuanggang Street in Hefei City, Anhui Province, enthusiastically responded to the Party's call and accumulated more than 6,900 dan of fertilizer in two days. This is a photo of them accumulating fertilizer at night. (Cheng Jiakai, Jiao Junlin, Xinhua News Agency manuscript)

    新华社天津11日电　天津市各城市人民公社普遍同农村人民公社建立固定联系，从人力、技术设备以及生活服务等方面有计划地支援农业。
    据统计，全市四十四个城市人民公社从今年7月份以来，在妥善安排好自己生产的情况下，已组织十七万多人次下乡参加农业劳动，现在每天还有五千多名社员经常在农村参加劳动。河东区郑庄子、大王庄等七个城市公社与郊区新立村公社十八个农业生产队挂勾以后，已先后组织五万二千多人次下乡，帮助农村灭荒、种菜等三万多亩。郑庄子城市公社为了使积的肥料能赶上农村种麦施肥的需要，组织了全社所有的交通工具，在两天的时间内动员了五万六千多人次，把六十二万多斤肥料送到了农村。
    各城市人民公社普遍采用把技术、供应、修理包下来和送上门的办法支援农村人民公社。河西区八个城市公社最近不但支援了郊区小站人民公社二十八个生产队大批急需的盘条、镰刀、肥料和动力设备等物资，而且采取分片包干的办法，组织三百多名修配人员下乡修配农具。南开区的八个城市公社专门组织了一支有经验的技术队伍，经常下乡修配农具和向社员传授技术。小站人民公社务本生产队菜地有虫害，大王庄城市公社立即组织技术人员赶到生产队抢修损坏的喷雾器，并且和当地社员一起突击灭虫，很快就制止了虫害的蔓延。
    许多城市人民公社派出技术员、炊事员、会计员、管理员、缝纫员、理发员、售货员、修理员等，下乡协助农村人民公社办好集体福利事业和为社员服务。东甡里人民公社的炊事员、管理员到郊区古佛寺生产队传播了节约用粮和改进管理的经验以后，使这个生产队的食堂每天可以节约粮食一百六十多斤、煤五百多斤。郑庄子城市公社在农村组织新颖的“保三秋庙会”，修理服务人员成套地下到农村，生产队社员们像赶集似的到庙会上修理大小农具、马具和黑白铁活等，仅仅一个星期，庙会上的修理服务人员就给生产队修理了各式农具和马具一百四十多件，自行车四十多辆，同时回收了一万四千多斤废金属。
    全市各城市人民公社最近都调整了社内的工业生产，扩大了为农业服务的力量。全市城市公社工业10月份生产的农业机具、农药和肥料等产品有一百一十种、一万六千多件。红桥区各城市公社已经有计划地安排了三十二种当前农业急需的产品，其中有一半是最近新增加的品种。
    新华社长春11日电　吉林市船营城市人民公社经常派出访问团到农村人民公社调查访问，了解农村当前生产上的需要，进一步组织公社所属工厂支援农业生产。今年1月到10月中旬，船营公社已帮助七个农村公社建立了七个小型农业机械修配厂；并且支援农村公社一部分机床、电动机、变压器等，还为农村公社培养了技术工人一百三十五名。
    船营公社今年已派人到农村公社访问了十七次。他们在访问中认真征求农民意见，了解当前农业生产的需要，然后订出支援的规划。春耕期间，船营公社工厂为农村赶制了五百台插秧机、六千片圆盘耙。夏锄期间，公社又动员人力帮助农村除草、灭虫达两万多个工日。不久前，船营公社的访问团到桦甸县农村常山人民公社访问的时候，看到常山农业公社的农具厂工人的技术水平较低；又在同农村干部和老农举行的座谈会上了解到公社当前迫切需要脱谷机等秋收工具，就以此作为当前支援农业的中心，发动各工厂突击生产了一批脱谷机等农业机械送到农村，派出两个技工巡回服务队，帮助农村赶制、修配秋收工具和动力机械，同时组织了七百多人下乡帮助秋收。船营公社还有十三名技术人员和工人在挂钩的农村公社长期落户（半年），帮助农村公社工厂提高技术水平。
    到农村参观访问以后，船营人民公社党委也进一步明确了发展城市公社工业和其他事业的方向，更牢固地树立了为农业服务的思想。他们根据农村情况，制订出了支援农业的规划，确定支援农业的主要内容是帮助农村公社建立和装备机械修配厂；为农村公社制造农具，加工部件和培训技术人材，增加为农业服务的项目和产品；支援劳动力等。接着，就调整和改组了部分社办工业，新建和扩建了七个为农业服务的工厂、车间。公社的轴承厂第一季度最高日产轴承九十套，经过访问后，感到不能满足农村需要，就对轴承厂进行了扩建，现在日产量最高达一百五十套以上。在一次访问中了解到农村公社缺乏农业机械修配力量，就把社办汽车修配厂改为汽车拖拉机修配厂，为农村人民公社修理拖拉机、柴油机等农业机械。现在，这个公社已增加了一百零八种为农村生产服务的产品，其中有农药、化肥、白皮马具和农具等。
