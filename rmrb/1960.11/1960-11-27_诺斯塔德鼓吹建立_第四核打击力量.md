Xinhua News Agency, Paris dispatch:  Norstad, Supreme Allied Commander Europe of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, at the parliamentary meeting of the group which opened on the 21st, strongly urged the establishment of a NATO nuclear armed force controlled by the United States, the so-called "Fourth Nuclear Strike Force."

    Norstad told the approximately two hundred parliamentarians from NATO member states attending the meeting that he had already presented his opinions on the group's military expansion and preparedness work to decision-makers within his general staff. He stated that the "global threat" would "continue" and that "European security continues to require (the establishment of) military strength," and that establishing a "deterrent force" was the "primary task" of NATO forces.

    He also said, "The troops currently in Europe are sufficient in number, but insufficient in terms of equipment," and that "troops must be deployed to use conventional weapons and, if necessary, nuclear weapons."

    He said that the NATO aggressive bloc should have "medium-range ballistic missiles based on land and sea as part of a modernization plan."

    Norstad boasted that this aggressive bloc had made "very important progress" in stepping up its war preparations in the past three years, saying that almost all NATO command headquarters possess forces capable of launching nuclear warheads, as well as some capable of launching conventional and nuclear warheads.

    诺斯塔德鼓吹建立“第四核打击力量”
    据新华社巴黎电　北大西洋集团武装部队总司令诺斯塔德在21日开幕的这个集团的议员会议上，极力敦促建立由美国控制的北大西洋集团核武装部队，即所谓“第四核打击力量”。
    诺斯塔德向出席会议的北大西洋集团成员国的二百名左右的议员说，他已经向他的参谋本部的决策人提出了关于这个集团的扩军备战工作的意见。他说什么“全球性的威胁”将“继续下去”，“欧洲的安全继续要求（建立）军事实力”，建立“威慑力量”是北大西洋集团军队的“首要任务”。
    他还说，“现在在欧洲的部队在数量上是足够的，但是在装备方面还不够”，“必须部署部队使用常规武器，并在必要时使用原子武器”。
    他说，应该使北大西洋侵略集团有“以陆地和海洋为基地的中程弹道导弹，以此作为现代化计划的一部分”。
    诺斯塔德鼓吹这个侵略集团在以往三年中在加紧备战方面已经取得了“非常重要的进展”，他说，在几乎所有的北大西洋公约组织的司令部里都拥有能够发射原子弹头的部队以及某些能够发射常规弹头和原子弹头的部队。
