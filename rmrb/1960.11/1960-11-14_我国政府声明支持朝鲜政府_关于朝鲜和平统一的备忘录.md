Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The full text of the statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China in support of the memorandum of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea is as follows:

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a memorandum on the peaceful reunification of Korea on November 11, solemnly refuting the shameless lies and absurd claims of the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea" to the Fifteenth United Nations General Assembly in its tenth "annual report" and "supplementary report," forcefully exposing the military provocations and aggressive enslavement plans of U.S. imperialism in southern Korea, and once again pointing out the legitimate path to peacefully resolving the Korean issue. This is a just call representing the common will of the 30 million Korean people, and the Chinese government and people fully support this solemn stance of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

As everyone knows, China and Korea have made unremitting efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea and safeguard peace in Asia and the World. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. On August 15th this year, Premier Kim Il-sung of the Korean Cabinet also proposed a new plan for the peaceful reunification of Korea, with the implementation of a federal system between northern and southern Korea as a transitional measure. In order to promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Chinese People's Volunteers proactively and completely withdrew from Korea as early as two years ago. These significant efforts by the Korean and Chinese sides have been supported and praised by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. However, U.S. imperialism persists in dividing Korea, exacerbating tensions in the Far East. It not only consistently refuses to withdraw its aggressive troops, but also continuously increases its military strength in South Korea, flagrantly violating the Korean Armistice Agreement, illegally transporting large quantities of new weapons into South Korea, deliberately turning South Korea into its colony and military base. The military occupation, political enslavement, and economic plunder by the U.S. aggressors cannot but arouse increasingly strong resistance from the South Korean people. The patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people against the U.S.-Syngman Rhee fascist rule that broke out in April this year demonstrates the bankruptcy of the U.S. policy of aggression. The Korean people's national aspirations to oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression and interference and to realize the peaceful reunification of their motherland cannot be stopped by any force.

The Chinese government has consistently believed that the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves without foreign interference. The U.S. aggressive troops' refusal to leave South Korea is the main obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea and the main source of escalating tensions in the Far East. Therefore, the Chinese government solemnly declares that, in order to realize the Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification of their motherland at an early date, the U.S. aggressive troops must immediately withdraw completely from southern Korea, and the U.S. must cease interfering in Korea by misappropriating the name of the United Nations or in any other way. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will, as always, unswervingly and resolutely support the just struggle of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Korean people to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

    我国政府声明支持朝鲜政府
    关于朝鲜和平统一的备忘录
    朝鲜问题应由朝鲜人民自己解决，美国侵略军必须立即从朝鲜南部全部撤走，美国必须停止盗用联合国名义或其他任何方式对朝鲜进行干涉。
    新华社13日讯　中华人民共和国政府支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府关于朝鲜和平统一问题的备忘录的声明，全文如下：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国11月11日发表了关于朝鲜和平统一的备忘录，严正地驳斥了所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”向第十五届联合国大会提出的第十次“年度报告”和“补充报告”的无耻谰言和荒谬主张，有力地揭露了美帝国主义在朝鲜南部的军事挑衅活动和侵略奴役计划，而且再一次指出了和平解决朝鲜问题的正当途径。这是代表三千万朝鲜人民共同意志的正义呼声，中国政府和人民完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这一严正立场。
    大家知道，朝中两国为了实现朝鲜的和平统一，维护亚洲和世界的和平，曾经进行了不懈的努力。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府多次提出和平解决朝鲜问题的合理主张。今年8月15日，朝鲜内阁金日成首相又提出了和平统一朝鲜的新方案，而以实施朝鲜北部和朝鲜南部的联邦制作为过渡措施。为了促成朝鲜问题的和平解决，中国人民志愿军早在两年前主动全部撤出朝鲜。朝中方面这些重大努力得到全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持和赞扬。但是，美帝国主义坚持分裂朝鲜，加剧远东紧张局势，不仅始终拒绝撤退它的侵略军队，反而不断增加它在南朝鲜的军事力量，悍然违反朝鲜停战协定，非法向南朝鲜运进大量新式武器，蓄意把南朝鲜变成它的殖民地和军事基地。美国侵略者的军事占领、政治奴役和经济掠夺，不能不激起南朝鲜人民日益强烈的反抗。今年4月间爆发的南朝鲜人民反对美李法西斯统治的爱国正义斗争，表明了美国侵略政策的破产。朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的侵略和干涉，要求实现祖国和平统一的民族愿望，是任何力量都不能阻挡的。
    中国政府一贯认为，朝鲜问题应该在没有外力干涉的情况下，由朝鲜人民自己解决。美国侵略军队赖在南朝鲜不走，是朝鲜和平统一的主要障碍和加剧远东紧张局势的主要根源。因此，中国政府郑重声明，为了使朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的愿望早日实现，美国侵略军队必须立即从朝鲜南部全部撤走，美国必须停止盗用联合国名义或者其他任何方式对朝鲜进行干涉。中国政府和中国人民将始终不渝地、坚决地支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和朝鲜人民为实现祖国和平统一而进行的正义斗争。
