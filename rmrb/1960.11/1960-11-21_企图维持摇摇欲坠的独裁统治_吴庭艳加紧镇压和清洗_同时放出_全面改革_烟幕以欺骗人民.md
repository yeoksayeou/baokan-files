Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 20th – Saigon Dispatch: After the failed Saigon coup on November 11, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in order to continue maintaining its crumbling dictatorial rule in South Vietnam, has been intensifying the elimination of dissidents and launching brutal suppression on the one hand, and releasing a so-called smoke screen of "comprehensive reform" in an attempt to paralyze and deceive the people on the other.

In recent days, Saigon streets have been filled with hundreds of secret agents who have conducted large-scale arrests. Currently, more than twenty important figures have been arrested by the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities. These include former "Minister of Economy" Tran Van Van, former "Minister of Foreign Affairs" Tran Van Do, and former "Mayor of Saigon" Tran Van Huong, among others. In order to create a legal basis for large-scale suppression, Ngo Dinh Diem also ordered his so-called "National Assembly" to pass a special resolution on "severely punishing" the coup participants.

Five newspaper offices have already been closed by the police for publishing comments criticizing the Ngo Dinh Diem clique during the coup. In addition to conducting extensive purges in the "government," Ngo Dinh Diem's security agencies have begun large-scale purges in the South Vietnamese army. Ngo Dinh Diem's "Committee for Anti-Communism and Anti-Rebellion" held a press conference on the 15th announcing that anyone who stood on the "coup side" on November 11 would not be spared. According to Saigon Radio, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique will even inflict "unimaginable punishments" on those whom they believe are unwilling to "expose" the coup participants.

At the same time, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is vigorously promoting so-called "comprehensive reforms." The remarks made by Ngo Dinh Diem's "Secretary of State" Nguyen Dinh Thuan at a press conference on the 17th indicate that Ngo Dinh Diem intends to use the name of "comprehensive reform" to carry out a comprehensive purge of his ruling apparatus (especially the army). Nguyen Dinh Thuan did not propose any specific "reform" plan, but clamored, "I want to remind you that we are at war, and it is impossible to grant full freedom immediately in some areas."

Ngo Dinh Diem's brother, "Presidential Political Advisor" Ngo Dinh Nhu, said on the 16th, when talking about the so-called "comprehensive reform," that his brother "will continue to be the head of state and head of government" and "does not intend to change the constitution." Ngo Dinh Nhu also revealed that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is studying a plan to expand the existing 150,000-strong army in order to "defend the boundaries of the 'free world'" and deal with "domestic subversive activities."

Ngo Dinh Nhu also defended Ngo Dinh Diem's family rule, saying that U.S. President Eisenhower also employed his family members in his government.

    企图维持摇摇欲坠的独裁统治  吴庭艳加紧镇压和清洗
    同时放出“全面改革”烟幕以欺骗人民
    新华社河内20日电　西贡消息：在11月11日的西贡政变失败以后，吴庭艳集团为了继续维持它在越南南方摇摇欲坠的独裁统治，一方面加紧排除异己，开始了残酷的镇压；一方面放出所谓“全面改革”的烟幕，企图用以麻痹和欺骗人民。
    近几天来，西贡街上布满了数百名密探，进行了大规模的逮捕。目前被吴庭艳当局逮捕的重要人物已有二十多人。其中包括前“经济部长”陈文云、前“外交部长”陈文杜、前“西贡市长”陈文香等。吴庭艳为了制造大规模镇压的法律根据，还命令它的所谓的“国会”通过了关于“严惩”政变参加者的特别决议。
    已有五家报馆因在政变期间发表了指责吴庭艳集团的评论而被警察封闭。除了正在“政府”中进行广泛的清洗外，吴庭艳的保安机关已在南越军队中开始了大规模的清洗。吴庭艳的“反共和反叛乱委员会”15日举行记者招待会宣布，将不放过11月11日站在“政变方面”的任何人。据西贡电台透露，吴庭艳集团甚至对他们认为是不肯“揭发”政变参加者的人，也将施以“不可想像的刑罚”。
    与此同时，吴庭艳集团大肆宣传要推行所谓“全面改革”。吴庭艳的“国务秘书”阮庭淳17日在记者招待会上发表的谈话表明，吴庭艳是想借“全面改革”之名在他的统治机构（特别是军队）中进行全面的清洗。阮庭淳没有提出任何具体的“改革”方案，却叫嚷说，“我要提醒你们，我们是在进行战争，而在某些地区还不可能马上给予全面的自由。”
    吴庭艳的弟弟、“总统政治顾问”吴庭儒16日在谈到所谓的“全面改革”时说，他的哥哥“将继续是国家元首和政府首脑”，“不打算改变宪法”。吴庭儒还透露，吴庭艳集团正在研究扩大已有十五万人的陆军的计划，以便“保卫‘自由世界’的疆界”和对付“国内的颠复活动”。
    吴庭儒并且为吴庭艳的家族统治辩护说，美国总统艾森豪威尔在他的政府中也任用他的家属。
