    To adapt to the needs of production development and strengthen on-site dispatch and command, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Open Hearth Furnace Plant No. 1 has implemented a responsibility system of shift work for leading cadres.
    This facilitates focused leadership of production, timely problem-solving, and increased work efficiency.
    (Our newspaper, Chongqing, 16th dispatch) Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Open Hearth Furnace Plant No. 1 has established a responsibility system for leading cadres to work in shifts, ensuring strong leadership during every shift and greatly strengthening on-site political and ideological work, as well as command and dispatch. The steel output in October rose every ten days. The output in the middle ten days of October increased sharply by 72.04% compared to the first ten days, and the output in the last ten days increased by another 39.7% compared to the middle ten days. Since November, the high production has continued.
    Since the smelting time in the Open Hearth Furnace Plant No. 1 was shortened from thirteen hours to more than seven hours, many new problems have emerged in the enterprise. Solving these problems requires the enterprise's management to be more in-depth, detailed, and solid. After carefully analyzing this new situation, the plant's Party committee believed that the Party committee's leadership should not only have the guiding ideology of sustained high production but also constantly improve enterprise leadership methods based on the principle of combining collective leadership and division of responsibility. The Party committee decided to establish a system of rotating shifts for the Party secretary, plant director, and Party committee members, contracting to do a good job in one shift's production and political and ideological work. While grasping the production of the current shift, the leading cadres on duty are also responsible for preparing for the next shift's production, ensuring that molten iron, molten iron ladles, molten steel ladles, converters, and ingot molds are all available.
    After implementing the responsibility system of shift work for leading cadres, the chaotic and passive phenomenon of leading cadres focusing more on day shifts and less on night shifts, or all coming and going together, and failing to make comprehensive arrangements for the work of the front line, the second line, and the points and surfaces, has been effectively overcome. Also, due to the strengthened on-site political and ideological work and on-site command and dispatch by the leading cadres, many problems have been solved in a timely manner. Once, as soon as the early shift took over, the molten iron trough of the iron-smelting furnace broke. The Party secretary and plant director on duty immediately studied and decided to organize forces to rush to repair it, and the workers from the previous shift also consciously stayed behind to assist in the repair. As a result, the work that usually takes seven or eight hours to complete was completed in just over three hours. Another time, the workers of the three major shifts created three rapid steelmaking experiences of cloth laying, slagging, and carbon distribution. After the Party secretary on duty learned about it, he immediately organized the leading cadres responsible for the first and second shifts to lead the workers to learn on the spot. As a result, the smelting time was quickly shortened by one hour and twenty minutes.
    Promoting the leadership cadre responsibility system has also greatly strengthened collective leadership. Because each leading cadre delves into a specific area, contacts many people, and deals with specific and practical problems, the analysis and research of problems at Party committee meetings will be more profound and comprehensive, and the handling of problems will be more accurate and timely. The gas production of this plant is insufficient, and furnace front isothermalization often occurs. This time, the Party committee assigned Deputy Secretary Wu Ruliang to follow the gas furnace workshop. He made a comprehensive understanding of the ideological situation, technical situation, and production equipment situation of the gas workshop workers, and then brought it to the Party committee for research. In this way, it was discovered that there was a unity problem between the old and new workers there. After analyzing this situation, the Party committee decided to start with the ideological work of being a person, and correspondingly solve the technical operation problems, and be sure to burn the gas well. Wu Ruliang brought the Party committee's decision to the gas furnace workshop, guided the workshop director and the workshop Party branch secretary to resolutely implement it, carried out in-depth and meticulous ideological work, helped the new and old workers sign apprenticeship contracts, and also used a week of spare time to focus on studying operating procedures. Now, the unity of this workshop has been strengthened, the gas has been burned well, and the phenomenon of isothermalization in front of the furnace has been eliminated.
    After the implementation of the shift-based division of labor, the leading cadres on duty generally do not participate in any meetings except in special circumstances, and concentrate on leading production. Those who are not on duty have sufficient time to study the Party's policies and instructions and consider problems in addition to grasping the various tasks on the second line and the surface. Therefore, not only is a better combination of work and rest and energy abundance achieved, but also the leadership level is improved more quickly. The leading cadres of this plant generally feel that they are doing more and better things than in the past, but they are not as busy as in the past, and their minds are clearer and they have more methods.

    适应生产发展需要　加强现场调度指挥
    重钢平炉一厂干部分工值班
    便于集中精力领导生产及时解决问题，提高工作效率
    本报重庆16日电　重庆钢铁公司平炉一厂建立领导干部分工值班的责任制度，使每天每个班都保持强有力的领导，大大加强了现场的政治思想工作和指挥调度。10月份钢产量旬旬上升，10月中旬比上旬猛增72.04％，下旬又比中旬增长了39.7％，11月份以来，仍然持续高产。
    平炉一厂自从冶炼时间由十三个小时缩短到七个多小时以后，企业里出现了许多新的问题，这些问题的解决就要求企业的管理工作作得更深入、更细致、更扎实。这个厂的党委在认真分析了这个新的形势之后，认为党委领导不仅要有持续高产的指导思想，还要根据集体领导与分工负责相结合的原则，不断改进企业领导方法。党委确定建立由党委书记、厂长和党委委员轮流值班的制度，包干搞好一个班的生产和政治思想工作。值班的领导干部在抓当班生产的同时，并负责为下一班的生产作好准备，做到铁水、铁水包、钢水包、转炉、钢锭模，样样俱全。
    实行领导干部分工值班的责任制以后，有效地克服了领导干部白班抓得多，夜班抓得少，或齐上齐下，对一线二线及点和面的工作通盘安排、兼顾不够的忙乱被动现象。也由于领导干部加强了现场的政治思想工作和现场的指挥调度，许多问题得到了及时的解决。一次，早班刚接班，化铁炉的铁水槽坏了，值班的党委书记、厂长马上研究决定组织力量突击抢修，上一班的工人也自觉地留下来协助抢修。结果，通常要七、八个小时才能完成的工作，只用三个多小时就修好了。又有一次，三大班职工创造了布料、放渣、配炭三条快速炼钢经验，当班的党委书记知道后，立即组织负责一、二两班的领导干部带领工人现场学习。结果，使冶炼时间很快缩短了一点二十分钟。
    推行领导干部责任制，还大大加强了集体领导。由于领导干部每个人都深入到一个具体方面，接触的群众多，接触的问题具体、实际，这样在党委会上分析研究问题时就会更深刻更全面，处理问题更准确、及时。这个厂煤气发生量不足，时常发生炉前等温。这次党委分工由副书记吴如良到煤气炉工段跟班。他对煤气工段职工的思想情况、技术情况、生产设备情况作了全面的了解，然后再提到党委会来研究。这样就发现了那里的老工人与新工人之间存在着团结问题。党委会分析了这个情况后，决定从做人的思想工作着手，相应的解决技术操作问题，一定要把煤气烧好。吴如良将党委决定带到煤气炉工段，指导工段长和工段党支部书记坚决贯彻执行，深入细致的做了思想工作，帮助新老工人订了师徒合同，还用一周的业余时间集中学习操作规程。现在，这个工段的团结加强了，煤气烧好了，消灭了炉前等温现象。
    实行按班分工以后，当班的领导干部除特殊情况外，一般不参加什么会议，聚精会神地领导生产。不当班的除抓好第二线和面的各项工作外，也有了充裕时间学习党的政策、指示和考虑问题，因此不仅更好地做到了劳逸结合精力充沛，同时更快的提高了领导水平，这个厂的领导干部们都普遍感到，现在事情比过去做得多，做得好，但却没有过去那样忙乱，头脑更清醒办法更多了。
