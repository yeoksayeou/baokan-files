Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: Welcome speech by Vice Premier Li Xiannian at the Capital Airport welcoming the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation:

Respectable Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba,
Respectable distinguished guests of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation,
Friends, Comrades:

Today, we are very pleased and honored to be able to welcome the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation headed by Major Guevara here. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I would like to extend a warm welcome and high respect to all the distinguished guests of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation, representatives of the heroic Cuban people.

Although China and Cuba are separated by vast oceans, the people of our two countries are closely linked in the common struggle against aggression and interference by U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people have always deeply cared about the revolutionary struggle waged by the Cuban people under very difficult conditions against U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Batista dictatorship, and have been overjoyed by every victory achieved by the Cuban people. After the victory of the revolution, the Cuban people, under the leadership of the Cuban Revolutionary Government headed by Prime Minister Fidel Castro, have waged a tit-for-tat struggle against all kinds of subversive and destructive activities of U.S. imperialism in the political, economic, and military fields with a heroic and tenacious spirit, winning the admiration and support of the people of the world, and have made significant achievements in developing the national economy and national culture. The Chinese government and the Chinese people extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Cuban Revolutionary Government and the Cuban people who are persevering in their struggle.

In July of this year, our government trade delegation visited your country and received a warm welcome and friendly reception from the Cuban Revolutionary Government and the Cuban people. Based on the deep friendship already established between the people of the two countries, we signed three agreements with the Cuban Revolutionary Government on trade payment, scientific and technological cooperation, and cultural cooperation. Not long ago, the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba marked a new development in the militant friendship between our two peoples. Today, we are very pleased to welcome the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation headed by Major Guevara to our country for a friendly visit in Beijing. We firmly believe that your visit will make a significant contribution to enhancing the understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples, and to further strengthening the mutual support and cooperation between China and Cuba in the common struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and in developing national economies. Let us wish Major Guevara and the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation a successful visit.

Long live the militant friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peoples!
Long live the victory of the Cuban people's revolution!
Long live the victory of the national and democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America!
Long live the great unity

    在首都机场上欢迎古巴政府经济代表团
    李先念副总理的欢迎词
    新华社17日讯　李先念副总理在首都机场欢迎古巴革命政府经济代表团的欢迎词尊敬的古巴国家银行行长埃尔内斯托·切·格瓦拉少校阁下，尊敬的古巴革命政府经济代表团全体贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    今天，我们能够在这里欢迎以格瓦拉少校为首的古巴革命政府经济代表团，感到非常愉快和荣幸。我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，向英勇的古巴人民的代表——古巴革命政府经济代表团的全体贵宾们，表示热烈的欢迎和崇高的敬意。
    中国和古巴远隔重洋，但是在反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉的共同斗争中，我们两国人民紧密地联系在一起。中国人民一直深切地关怀着古巴人民在十分困难的条件下所进行的反对美帝国主义及其走狗巴蒂斯塔独裁统治的革命斗争，并且为古巴人民取得的每一个胜利而欢欣鼓舞。革命胜利以后，古巴人民在以菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理为首的古巴革命政府领导下，以英勇顽强的精神，对美帝国主义在政治、经济和军事上的种种颠复破坏活动进行了针锋相对的斗争，赢得了全世界人民的钦佩和支持，并且在发展民族经济和民族文化方面取得了重大的成就。中国政府和中国人民谨向坚持斗争的古巴革命政府和古巴人民致以衷心的祝贺。
    今年7月，我国政府贸易代表团访问了你们的国家，受到了古巴革命政府和古巴人民的热烈欢迎和友好接待，并且在两国人民早已建立起来的深厚友谊的基础上，同古巴革命政府签订了贸易支付、科学技术合作和文化合作三个协定。不久以前，中古两国外交关系的建立，标志着我们两国人民之间的战斗友谊有了新的发展。今天，我们又以十分愉快的心情在北京欢迎以格瓦拉少校为首的古巴革命政府经济代表团来我国进行友好访问。我们深信，你们的这次访问，对于增进中古两国人民之间的了解和友谊，对于进一步加强中古两国在反对美帝国主义侵略和发展民族经济的共同斗争中的相互支持和合作，必将作出重大的贡献。让我们预祝格瓦拉少校和古巴革命政府经济代表团访问成功。
    中、古两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    古巴人民革命胜利万岁！
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主运动胜利万岁！全世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
