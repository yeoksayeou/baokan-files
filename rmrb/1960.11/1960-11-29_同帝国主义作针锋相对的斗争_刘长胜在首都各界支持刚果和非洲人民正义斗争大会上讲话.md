    Waging a Tit-for-Tat Struggle Against Imperialism
    Liu Changsheng's Speech at the Capital's Conference Supporting the Just Struggle of the Congolese and African People

    Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Liu Changsheng, President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, spoke at the Capital's People's Conference in Support of the Congolese and African People's Just Struggle to Win and Defend National Independence and Oppose Imperialist Aggression. The full text is as follows:
    Comrades, friends:
    Today, we, the people of all circles in the capital, are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, and are gathering here solemnly to support the just struggle of the Congolese and African people against imperialism and colonialism, and for national independence. First of all, let our conference extend our highest brotherly respect to the Congolese people who are engaged in a heroic struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and interference, and to the people of all African countries who are bravely advancing for national independence!
    At present, the African continent is undergoing inspiring, rapid, and enormous changes. The national independence movement has spread throughout Africa, and is developing more and more widely and deeply with an irresistible force. New independent countries are being born one after another. Since this year alone, seventeen African countries have declared their independence. This means that three-quarters of the African people have achieved or initially achieved independence. The people of these countries are continuing their struggle to further get rid of imperialist political, economic, and military control, and to consolidate independence or strive for complete independence. The heroic Algerian people have persisted in the war of resistance for seven years, and have become stronger as they fight, setting a brilliant example for the cause of national liberation of the African people. The people of Cameroon are also waging a tenacious struggle to achieve the complete independence of their country. The people of Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar, Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique, "Portuguese" Guinea, Tanganyika, Ruanda-Urundi, and other places are carrying out struggles against colonialism and for national independence through various forms and means. The struggle of the South African people against racial discrimination is also becoming increasingly fierce. Now, the consciousness of the African people has been greatly raised, the strength of the African people is growing, and their unity with each other is constantly developing and strengthening. The struggle of the people of Africa for national liberation has become an irresistible torrent, accelerating the further disintegration and collapse of the imperialist colonial system, and making historically significant contributions to the cause of the world's people against imperialist aggression and defending world peace.
    However, the successive victories of the African national independence movement do not mean that the African people's struggle will be smooth sailing, let alone that imperialism will automatically get out of Africa. Facts show that imperialist colonial forces are carrying out frantic counterattacks and death throes in Africa. Old-brand imperialists and colonialists are racking their brains, playing various conspiracies and tricks, attempting to maintain or restore their colonial rule. What is even more noteworthy is that U.S. imperialism is trying its best to invade Africa from all sides, suppress the African national independence movement, and try to place the African people under its new type of colonial rule. The African people are facing arduous and complex tasks of struggle. They must not only fight to completely drive out the old-brand colonialist forces, but also especially fight to smash the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism. Only through a long and tortuous struggle can the African people win the complete victory of the cause of national liberation.
    The development of the situation in the Congo in recent months has concentratedly reflected the complexity, tortuousness, and arduousness of the African people's struggle for national liberation, and at the same time, it has concentratedly exposed the extremely insidious and extremely brutal features of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, in dealing with people's revolutions.
    Five months ago, under the vigorous development of the entire African national independence movement, the Congolese people, relying on their own struggle, forced the Belgian colonialists to recognize the independence of the Congo. However, the Belgian government, like all colonialists, was absolutely unwilling to give up its colonial interests. It wanted to continue to control the Congo in political, economic, and military aspects. When the Congolese patriotic army and people rose up to drive out the Belgian colonial officers and eliminate the Belgian colonial forces, it immediately launched an armed invasion of the Congo. It was at this time that U.S. imperialism, in the name of "aid" to the Congo and under the banner of the United Nations, massively invaded the Congo. At that time, some well-meaning people hoped that the intervention of the United Nations would stop the aggression of the Belgian colonialists and help the Congolese people achieve complete independence. But what was the result of the development of the matter? The Belgian colonial forces were not driven away, but a U.S. imperialism, which was many times more ferocious than Belgium, came in. The United States used the "United Nations army" under its control to arbitrarily infringe upon and trample on the sacred sovereignty of the Congo, and carried out bloody suppression of the Congolese people's patriotic and just struggle. The United States also actively supported its agents, planned various rebellions and split activities, paralyzed the legal government of Lumumba, and tried its best to provoke the relationship between the Congo and other African countries and the relationship with socialist countries, in an attempt to make the Congolese people's struggle lose support from all sides. The aggression and interference carried out by U.S. imperialism through the United Nations have brought infinite disasters to the Congolese people and greatly deepened the national crisis in the Congo.
    The evolution of the situation in the Congo for more than four months has provided extremely profound lessons for the Congolese people, the African people, and the people of the world.
    The experience of the Congo proves that all imperialist colonialist forces, including Belgium, a relatively small colonialist country, will never willingly give up their colonial rule. When the colonial people rise up to carry out a resolute struggle, in order to ease this struggle and maintain their colonial interests, they have to retreat in order to advance, allowing the colonial people a certain degree of independence. However, when the struggle of the colonial people touches their fundamental interests, these imperialist colonialist forces will show their true colors and desperately suppress the national independence movement of the colonial people. This fully shows that the aggressive nature of imperialism and colonialism will not change. They can never be kind to the colonial people. The struggle between the colonial people and imperialism and colonialism cannot but be a life-and-death struggle.
    The experience of the Congo proves that U.S. imperialism is not only the main pillar of the contemporary imperialist colonial system, but it is also the most ferocious, insidious, and greedy colonialist force itself. On the one hand, U.S. imperialism colludes with old-brand colonialist countries, colluding with each other to suppress and strangle the national independence movement of the colonial people. On the other hand, it takes advantage of the situation where the old-brand colonialist countries are discredited and forced to withdraw, and gradually squeeze out the forces of other imperialisms, replacing them. In order to achieve this evil goal, U.S. imperialism has adopted more cunning and vicious means than the old-brand colonialism, trying its best to disguise itself as sympathetic to the national independence movement, and using the United Nations as a cover and "aid" as bait, attempting to make some newly independent countries fall into its trap unknowingly. The actions of U.S. imperialism in the Congo have completely exposed the hypocrisy and deceptiveness of its so-called sympathy and aid to the national independence movement, and completely exposed that the United Nations, manipulated by the United States, is only a tool serving the U.S. policy of aggression and expansion. U.S. President-elect Kennedy once unabashedly said that "the United Nations must be made the central tool for the United States' efforts in Africa." Eisenhower's "five-point plan" proposed at the United Nations General Assembly to "protect the emerging countries of Africa by the United Nations" and the so-called "explanatory proposal" of the "United Nations plan for the independence and development of Africa" submitted by the U.S. representative to this United Nations General Assembly, have repeatedly shown that U.S. imperialism is promoting its set of "experiences" in invading the Congo to the entire Africa, in order to realize its ambition of encompassing Africa. All this proves that U.S. imperialism is the most important and the most ferocious enemy of the Congolese people and the African people. We must not have any unrealistic illusions about it. If the African people want to achieve the complete victory of national liberation, they must direct the main struggle against U.S. imperialism, maintain sufficient vigilance against it, constantly expose all its conspiracies and tricks, and wage a tit-for-tat struggle against it.
    The experience of the Congo proves that the liberation of the African people and all oppressed nations must rely on their own struggles, rely on the power in the hands of the people themselves, and win victory step by step. There is no easy way. In order to strengthen the forces of the national liberation struggle, all oppressed nations must constantly strengthen the patriotic unity of their own nations, and constantly strengthen the great unity of all nations against imperialism. As long as this is done, all the conspiracies of imperialism will be difficult to succeed, and the victory of the liberation cause of the oppressed nations will be reliably guaranteed.
    We are pleased to see that after more than four months of tortuous and complex struggles, the Congolese people have raised their awareness, strengthened their unity, and gradually recognized their true enemies. Now the patriotic people in various regions of the Congo are regrouping their ranks, taking up arms, resisting the imperialist aggressor forces headed by the United States, and continuing to wage a resolute struggle to defend national independence, maintain sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Especially in Katanga Province, which is tightly controlled by the imperialist forces, the Congolese people, defying the bloody massacre by the Tshombe traitor group and the "United Nations army," have also launched an organized patriotic armed struggle. On the 23rd of this month, the Congolese army in Matadi and Kisi in Lower Congo disarmed the "United Nations army," and held a large demonstration of 150,000 people in Leopoldville to protest the "United Nations army" killing Congolese soldiers, and the demonstrators shouted the slogan "United Nations army get out of the Congo." All these facts show that the Congolese people's struggle for national liberation is moving towards a higher stage.
    Based on its own revolutionary experience, the Chinese people deeply know that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and that they must and can be completely overthrown by the power of the people. In the process of a long struggle against imperialism, the Chinese people have suffered many setbacks and failures, and the strength of the Chinese people was once weak compared with the strength of imperialism and reactionaries. However, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have grown from small to large, from weak to strong, and finally overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and won the complete victory of the people's great revolution. The Chinese people can fully understand the current situation of struggle faced by the Congolese people and the African people. The difficulties they are currently encountering are only temporary and partial difficulties on their road to victory. From a global perspective and from a long-term perspective, their struggle prospects are very bright. At present, the entire international situation is very favorable to the cause of all countries' people to strive for peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism. The strength of the socialist camp exceeds the strength of imperialism, the strength of peace exceeds the strength of war, the strength of progress exceeds the strength of reaction, and the strength of national liberation exceeds the strength of colonialism. What is particularly worth pointing out is that U.S. imperialism is facing the fourth economic crisis since the war, and the contradictions within imperialism are becoming increasingly profound and acute. The days of imperialism are getting worse and worse. Under this excellent situation, as long as the Congolese people and the African people further strengthen unity and continue to struggle, they will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve the complete victory of the cause of national liberation.
    Comrades, friends, we, the 650 million Chinese people, resolutely support the Congolese people's struggle to safeguard national independence, support the legal government of the Congo represented by Lumumba, and condemn the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and its agents to undermine the independence and unity of the Congo. The Chinese people resolutely support the Algerian people and all African people's struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and for winning and safeguarding national independence. The Chinese people resolutely support the patriotic and just struggle of the Japanese people and the Lao people, and resolutely support the just demands of the Indonesian people to liberate West Irian and the Indian people to liberate Goa. The Chinese people resolutely support the Cuban people's struggle against U.S. interference and to defend the achievements of the revolution, and resolutely support the struggle of the people of Latin American countries against U.S. control and to safeguard national independence. The Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of the people of the world to strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, to strive for universal disarmament, to ban nuclear weapons, and to oppose aggressive military treaties and foreign military bases. The Chinese people believe that all these struggles have made important contributions to the great cause of defending world peace and have also given the Chinese people strong support. The Chinese people will always stand together with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, with the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and with all peace-loving and progressive forces in the world, to fight to the end against the aggression policy and war policy of imperialism headed by the United States, to defend world peace and promote human progress.
    Let us shout:
    Imperialism get Out of the Congo! Get out of Africa!
    Long live the struggle of the African people to win and defend national independence!
    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and African people!
    Long live the solidarity of the Asian and African people!
    Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
    Long live world peace!

    同帝国主义作针锋相对的斗争
    刘长胜在首都各界支持刚果和非洲人民正义斗争大会上讲话
    新华社28日讯　中国非洲人民友好协会会长刘长胜在首都各界人民支持刚果和非洲人民争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义侵略大会上的讲话。全文如下：同志们，朋友们：
    今天，我们首都各界人民，热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会的倡议，在这里隆重集会，支持刚果人民和非洲人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义，争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争。首先，让我们的大会向正在为反对美帝国主义侵略和干涉而坚持英勇斗争的刚果人民，向正在为争取民族独立奋勇前进的非洲各国人民，致以崇高的兄弟的敬意！
    目前，非洲大陆正在经历着振奋人心的、迅速和巨大的变化。民族独立运动已经遍及非洲各地，并且正以不可阻挡的威势，愈来愈广泛和深入地向前发展。新的独立国家一个接着一个地诞生。光是今年以来，非洲就有十七个国家宣布了独立。这就是说，占全非人口四分之三的非洲人民已经获得或者初步获得了独立。这些国家的人民正在为进一步摆脱帝国主义的政治、经济和军事的控制，为巩固独立或争取完全的独立而继续进行着斗争。英勇的阿尔及利亚人民坚持了七年的抗战，并且愈战愈强，为非洲人民的民族解放事业树立了光辉的榜样。喀麦隆人民也正在为实现国家的完全独立而进行着顽强的斗争。怯尼亚、乌干达、桑给巴尔、尼亚萨兰、南北罗得西亚、安哥拉、莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚、坦噶尼喀、卢安达—乌隆迪等等地方的人民都正在通过多种多样的形式和手段进行着反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争。南非人民反抗种族歧视的斗争也日趋激烈。现在，非洲人民的觉悟已经大大提高，非洲人民的力量正在成长壮大，他们相互之间的团结也在不断地发展和加强。非洲各地人民争取民族解放的斗争，已经成为不可抗拒的洪流，加速着帝国主义殖民体系的进一步瓦解和崩溃，对世界人民反对帝国主义侵略、维护世界和平的事业作出了具有历史意义的贡献。
    但是，非洲民族独立运动的节节胜利，并不意味着非洲人民的斗争会是一帆风顺的，更不意味着帝国主义会自动地从非洲滚出去。事实表明，帝国主义殖民势力正在非洲进行疯狂的反扑和垂死的挣扎。老牌帝国主义和殖民主义正在用尽心机，玩弄种种阴谋诡计，企图维持或者恢复它们的殖民统治。更加值得注意的是，美帝国主义正在千方百计地从各方面侵入非洲，镇压非洲的民族独立运动，力图把非洲人民置于它的新型殖民统治之下。非洲人民正面临着艰巨的复杂的斗争任务。他们不仅要为彻底驱逐老牌殖民主义势力而斗争，而且特别要为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略和干涉而斗争。非洲人民只有经过长期的曲折的斗争，才能赢得民族解放事业的彻底胜利。
    最近几个月来刚果局势的发展，集中地反映了非洲人民争取民族解放斗争的复杂性、曲折性和艰巨性，同时也集中地暴露了帝国主义特别是美帝国主义对付人民革命的极其阴险和极残暴的狰狞面目。
    五个月以前，在整个非洲民族独立运动蓬勃发展的形势下，刚果人民依靠自己的斗争，迫使比利时殖民主义者不得不承认刚果的独立。但是，比利时政府和一切殖民主义者一样，绝不甘心放弃自己的殖民利益。它要继续从政治、经济、军事各方面控制刚果，当刚果爱国军队和人民起来驱逐比利时殖民军官，肃清比利时殖民势力的时候，它就立刻发动了对刚果的武装侵略。正是在这个时候，美帝国主义以“援助”刚果为名，打着联合国的旗号，大举侵入刚果。当时有些好心善意的人，曾经指望联合国的干预会制止比利时殖民主义者的侵略，帮助刚果人民获得完全的独立。但是事情发展的结果又怎么样呢？比利时殖民势力并没有被赶走，却又进来了一个比比利时不知凶恶多少倍的美帝国主义。美国利用它操纵下的“联合国军”恣意侵犯和蹂躏刚果的神圣主权，对刚果人民的爱国正义斗争进行了血腥镇压。美国还积极扶植自己的代理人，策划种种叛乱和分裂活动，使卢蒙巴合法政府陷于瘫痪状态，并且极力挑拨刚果同其它非洲国家的关系、同社会主义国家的关系，企图使刚果人民的斗争失去各方面的支持。美国帝国主义利用联合国所进行的侵略和干涉给刚果人民带来了无穷的灾难，大大地加深了刚果的民族危机。
    四个多月来刚果局势的演变，为刚果人民、非洲人民和全世界人民提供了极为深刻的教训。
    刚果的经验证明，一切帝国主义殖民主义势力，包括比利时这样比较小的殖民主义国家，都决不会甘心情愿地放弃它们的殖民统治。当着殖民地人民纷纷起来进行坚决斗争的时候，它们为了和缓这种斗争，借以维持自己的殖民利益，不得不以退为进，允许殖民地人民一定程度的独立，但是当着殖民地人民的斗争触动它们的根本利益的时候，这些帝国主义殖民主义势力就原形毕露，穷凶极恶地镇压殖民地人民的民族独立运动。这就充分说明，帝国主义、殖民主义的侵略本性是不会改变的，它们永远不可能对殖民地人民发出善心，殖民地人民同帝国主义、殖民主义之间的斗争，不能不是一场你死我活的斗争。
    刚果的经验证明，美帝国主义不仅是当代帝国主义殖民制度的主要支柱，而且它本身就是最凶恶、最阴险和最贪婪的殖民主义势力。美帝国主义一方面同老牌殖民主义国家互相勾结，狼狈为奸，镇压和绞杀殖民地人民的民族独立运动，一方面又利用老牌殖民主义国家声名狼籍、被迫撤退的形势，逐步排挤其它帝国主义的势力，取它们的地位而代之。为了达到这种罪恶的目的，美帝国主义采取了比老牌殖民主义更为狡猾和毒辣的手段，极力把自己打扮成同情民族独立运动的样子，并且用联合国作掩护，用“援助”作诱饵，企图使一些新独立的国家不知不觉地落入它的圈套。美帝国主义在刚果的所作所为，彻底戳穿了它所谓同情和援助民族独立运动的虚伪性和欺骗性，彻底戳穿了在美国操纵下的联合国只不过是为美国侵略扩张政策服务的一个工具而已。美国新当选的总统肯尼迪曾经毫不讳言地说过，“必须使联合国成为美国在非洲进行努力的中心工具”。艾森豪威尔在联合国大会上所提出的“由联合国来保护非洲新兴国家”的“五点计划”和美国代表向这次联合国大会提出的所谓“联合国关于非洲独立和发展计划”的“说明性提案”，都一再表明美帝国主义正在把它侵略刚果的一套“经验”，推广到整个非洲，以便实现它囊括非洲的野心。所有这些，证明美帝国主义是刚果人民和非洲人民最主要也是最凶恶的敌人，决不能对它怀抱任何不切实际的幻想，非洲人民要取得民族解放的彻底胜利，就必须把主要的斗争锋芒指向美帝国主义，对它保持足够的警惕，不断揭露它的一切阴谋诡计，同它进行针锋相对的斗争。
    刚果的经验证明，非洲人民和一切被压迫民族的解放必须依靠自己的斗争，依靠人民自己手里的力量，去一步一步地夺取胜利，任何方便的途径都是不存在的。为了壮大民族解放斗争的力量，一切被压迫民族必须不断加强本民族的爱国大团结，不断加强各民族之间反对帝国主义的大团结。只要做到这一点，帝国主义的一切奸计就难以得逞，被压迫民族解放事业的胜利就会得到可靠的保证。
    我们高兴地看到，经过四个多月曲折和复杂的斗争，刚果人民已经提高了觉悟，加强了团结，逐步认清了自己真正的敌人。现在刚果各地区爱国人民正重新集结自己的队伍，拿起武器，抗击以美国为首的帝国主义侵略势力，为保卫民族独立、维护主权和领土完整而继续进行坚决的斗争。特别是在帝国主义势力严密控制着的加丹加省，刚果人民冒着冲伯卖国集团和“联合国军”的血腥屠杀，也展开了有组织的爱国武装斗争。本月23日，下刚果省马塔迪和基西的刚果军队解除了“联合国军”的武装，在利奥波德维尔举行了抗议“联合国军”打死刚果军人的十五万人的大示威，在示威的人群中喊出了“联合国军滚出刚果去”的口号。所有这些事实，说明刚果人民争取民族解放的斗争正在走向一个更高的阶段。
    中国人民根据自己的革命经验，深知帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，都是必须而且完全能够被人民的力量打倒的。中国人民在同帝国主义进行长期斗争的过程中，曾经遭到过不少挫折和失败，中国人民的力量同帝国主义和反动派的力量比较起来曾经是弱小的。但是，中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，由小到大，由弱转强，终于推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，赢得了人民大革命的彻底胜利。中国人民完全能够理解刚果人民和非洲人民目前所面临的斗争处境。他们目前所遭到的某些困难，只不过是他们走向胜利的道路上的暂时和局部的困难，从全局看来，从长远看来，他们的斗争前景是非常光明的。目前，整个国际形势十分有利于各国人民争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义的事业。社会主义阵营的力量超过了帝国主义的力量，和平力量超过了战争力量，进步力量超过了反动力量，民族解放力量超过了殖民主义力量。特别值得指出的是，美帝国主义正面临着战后第四次经济危机，帝国主义内部的矛盾正在日益深刻化和尖锐化，帝国主义的日子越来越不好过了。在这种大好形势下，只要刚果人民、非洲人民进一步加强团结，再接再厉地进行斗争，他们就一定能够战胜一切困难，取得民族解放事业的彻底胜利。
    同志们，朋友们，我们六亿五千万中国人民坚决支持刚果人民维护民族独立的斗争，支持以卢蒙巴为代表的刚果合法政府，谴责美帝国主义和它的代理人破坏刚果独立和统一的阴谋。中国人民坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民和所有非洲人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争。中国人民坚决支持日本人民、老挝人民的爱国正义斗争，坚决支持印度尼西亚人民解放西伊里安和印度人民解放果阿的正义要求。中国人民坚决支持古巴人民反对美国干涉、保卫革命成果的斗争，坚决支持拉丁美洲各国人民反对美国控制、维护民族独立的斗争。中国人民坚决支持全世界人民争取不同社会制度国家和平共处、争取普遍裁军、禁止核武器、反对侵略性军事条约和外国军事基地的斗争。中国人民认为所有这些斗争都对保卫世界和平的伟大事业作出了重要贡献，也给予中国人民以有力的支持。中国人民将永远同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营一道，同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民一道，同全世界一切和平进步力量一道，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义的侵略政策、战争政策，为保卫世界和平和促进人类进步而奋斗到底。
    让我们高呼：
    帝国主义从刚果滚出去！从非洲滚出去！
    非洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争胜利万岁！
    中国与非洲人民友好万岁！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
