    Clothing Factory Beside the Blast Furnace

    The Shijingshan Processing and Repair Center Store in Beijing established a clothing factory beside the blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, undertaking the processing tasks for more than 50 types of protective equipment for Shijingshan Iron and Steel.

    Once, the No. 2 blast furnace of Shijingshan Iron and Steel underwent a major overhaul during the holiday. Everything was ready, but there was a shortage of calcium carbide barrel covers. Yang Shusen, the manager of the Processing and Repair Center Store, learned about this and thought: Although the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Clothing Factory should be resting today, we cannot affect the furnace repair! He immediately ran around looking for people in the dormitories and workers' homes. The workers of the clothing factory, upon hearing that it was to support the overhaul of the blast furnace, rushed to the factory. In less than half an hour, ten calcium carbide barrel covers were made, ensuring the timely repair of the No. 2 blast furnace.

    The ingot workers' protective shoes needed wooden soles. With wooden-soled shoes, the ingot workers' feet would not get burned. The clothing factory had never produced this type of product before. They sent technicians Lu Yuanming, Li Fumao, and Wu Zeng to the site to interview the workers, understand their requirements, and repeatedly researched, finally producing one hundred pairs of wooden-soled shoes. When the workers of the casting section of the Shijingshan Experimental Factory received these wooden-soled shoes, they immediately wrote a big-character poster to the shoe-making department of the clothing factory, expressing their intention to repay their enthusiastic support with outstanding production achievements.

    高炉旁的服装加工厂
    北京市石景山加工修理中心商店在石景山钢铁公司的高炉旁设立了个服装加工厂，把石钢五十多种防护用品的加工任务担当起来。
    有一次，石钢二号高炉利用假日大修。什么都准备好了，就是缺少电石桶罩。这件事被加工修理中心店经理杨树森知道了，他想：虽然今天石钢服装加工厂的工人应该休息，可是不能影响修炉呀！他马上东奔西跑地到宿舍和职工家里去找人。服装加工厂的工人们一听是支援检修高炉，都纷纷赶到厂里来。不到半小时，十个电石桶罩就做好了，保证了二号高炉的及时检修。
    铸锭工人的防护鞋需要木底鞋。有了木底鞋，铸锭工人脚就不会烙热。服装加工厂过去从来没有生产过这种产品。他们便派技工芦元明、李福茂、吴增等到现场访问工人了解他们的要求，翻来复去地研究，终于制成了一百双木底鞋。当石钢试验厂浇铸工段的工人拿到这些木底鞋以后，立刻给服装加工厂制鞋部写了一张大字报，表示要用出色的生产成绩答谢他们的热情支援。
