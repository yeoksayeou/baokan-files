　　Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 2nd. According to local newspapers, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party held an enlarged plenary session on October 31st and November 1st. The meeting heard the report on the draft national economic development plan for 1961 by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Party Central Committee. The meeting unanimously approved his report and adopted the national economic development plan for 1961.
　　In his report, Gheorghiu-Dej first talked about the development of the Romanian national economy in 1960. He said that Romania's industrial production this year is expected to increase by 15.5% compared to 1959, while the plan stipulated 14%. All industrial sectors, especially those playing a decisive role in socialist industrialization, will have substantial growth. For example, the machine manufacturing and metal processing industries will grow by 20%, the steel industry by 30%, and the electric power industry by 14%. In terms of consumer goods production, the textile industry's production will increase by 16%, and the food industry by more than 11%.
　　Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out that the material and technical foundation of socialist agriculture is continuing to expand. This year, 11,600 tractors will be added in rural areas. Although the climatic conditions in some states are not good, this year's agricultural production will still guarantee consumption needs and the growth of national reserves.
　　The total investment in the national economy in 1960 will increase by nearly 33% compared to 1959. A total of seventeen new enterprises and seventeen new workshops will be put into production this year; the number of expanded and renovated factories and enterprises will reach eighty-two.
　　It is expected that industrial labor productivity will increase by 10.5% this year compared to last year.
　　Gheorghiu-Dej then spoke about the draft national economic development plan for 1961. He said that the draft plan stipulates that efforts must be concentrated on continuing to vigorously carry out socialist industrialization, further increasing agricultural and livestock products, and raising the material and cultural living standards of the working people.
　　The draft stipulates that the total output value of socialist industry in 1961 will increase by 13.5% compared to the estimated figure for 1960. Among them, the production of means of production will increase by 13.8%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 13%.
　　He pointed out that the growth of industrial production in 1961 will largely depend on increasing labor productivity. Labor productivity in 1961 will increase by about 9% compared to 1960.
　　The draft plan stipulates that under normal natural conditions, agricultural production in 1961 will increase by 19% compared to 1960. The state's investment in agriculture will reach 4 billion lei, and agriculture will receive 12,000 tractors and many other agricultural machines and chemical fertilizers.
　　He pointed out that the experience of 1960 proves that deep plowing, timely sowing, the selection of high-yielding varieties, and the use of natural and chemical fertilizers are of decisive importance to grain production. In the past three years, the state's investment in water conservancy construction has totaled 860 million lei.
　　Gheorghiu-Dej said that the total state investment in 1961 will reach 27.9 billion lei, an increase of 24% compared to the estimated total investment in 1960.
　　In 1961, twenty-six enterprises and thirty-four workshops will be put into production, and another ninety-six enterprises and workshops will be expanded and renovated.
　　In 1961, the number of employees in the economic sector will increase by 200,000, the wage income of the working people will increase by nearly 11% compared to 1960, and the cash income of farmers from selling agricultural products to the state will increase by more than 1 billion lei.
　　Gheorghiu-Dej finally called on all departments and economic units to further improve leadership work, and called on party organizations to carry out huge political and organizational work to mobilize the working people to complete production plans, increase labor productivity, reduce costs, improve product quality, and promote new technologies.

    乔治乌—德治在报告中首先谈到了1960年罗马尼亚国民经济的发展情况。他说，今年罗马尼亚的工业生产预计将比1959年增长15.5％，而计划规定是14％。一切工业部门，特别是对社会主义工业化起决定作用的部门的生产，将有巨大的增长，例如，机器制造和金属加工工业增长20％，钢铁工业增长30％，电力工业增长14％。在消费品生产方面，纺织工业的生产将增长16％，食品工业11％以上。
    乔治乌—德治指出，社会主义农业的物质技术基础在继续扩大，今年农村中将增加一万一千六百台拖拉机。虽然某些州的气候条件不好，但是，今年的农业生产仍能保证消费的需要和国家储备的增长。
    1960年国民经济投资总额比1959年增加将近33％。今年总共将有十七个新企业、十七个新车间投入生产；扩建和改建的工厂企业将达八十二个。

    他指出，1960年的经验证明，深耕、适时播种、选用高产良种、使用天然肥料和化学肥料，对谷物生产具有决定性的重要意义。最近三年来，国家用于兴修水利的投资共达八亿六千万列伊。
    乔治乌—德治说，1961年国家投资总额将达二百七十九亿列伊，比1960年预计要达到的投资总额增长24％。
