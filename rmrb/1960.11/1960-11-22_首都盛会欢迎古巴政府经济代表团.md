Xinhua News Agency, November 21st:
    The grand gathering was attended by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian.
    Vice Mayor Wan Li said that the Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Cuban and Latin American people.
    Head of Delegation Guevara said that the Cuban people's response to every act of imperialist aggression is to take a step forward.

    Over ten thousand people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand rally in the Great Hall of the People today to warmly welcome the distinguished guests from the Western front of the struggle against U.S. imperialism – Major E Che Guevara, President, National Bank of Cuba, and the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation he leads.

    Today's meeting was filled with a warm atmosphere. Major Guevara said in his speech that the Cuban people’s response to every act of imperialist aggression is to take a step forward. Cuba is by no means isolated. The people of China and Cuba share a common enemy, who hates us both. The people of China and Cuba also share a common aspiration for a better world, and the friendship between the two peoples will last as long as the snow on the Himalayas. Beijing Vice Mayor Wan Li solemnly stated: Six hundred and fifty million Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Cuban people and the Latin American people.

    At the center of the rostrum today were the national flags of China and Cuba, hung side by side. The meeting place was decorated with huge banners written in Chinese and Spanish: "Long Live the Friendship Between the Chinese and Cuban People!" "Salute to the Heroic Cuban People!"

    At 4:15 p.m., amid applause and the music of the "July 26th" Cuban Revolution march, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, Beijing Vice Mayor Wan Li, together with Major Guevara and members of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation: Administrative Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Lluompart, General Manager of the Cuban Foreign Trade Bank Major Mora, Major Ricart and other distinguished guests, walked onto the rostrum. A group of Young Pioneers presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

    Also seated on the rostrum were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Geng Biao, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Lu Xuzhang, Chinese Ambassador to Cuba Shen Jian, Beijing Vice Mayors Feng Jiping, Wu Han, Le Songsheng, President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association Chu Tunan, Vice President Zhou Erfu, and leaders from various sectors of Beijing.

    Foreign guests and students from Latin American countries in Beijing were invited to attend the welcome rally.

    The meeting began with the playing of the national anthems of Cuba and China.

    Wan Li delivered a speech at the welcome rally (full text on page four). He extended the warmest welcome to the Cuban guests on behalf of the people of all walks of life in the capital, and paid a lofty, fraternal, and fighting salute to the heroic Cuban people.

    Wan Li enthusiastically praised the victory of the Cuban Revolution. He said that the Chinese people are extremely happy for the victory achieved by the Cuban people under the leadership of Prime Minister Fidel Castro and his comrades. He pointed out: "U.S. imperialism is extremely hostile to the Cuban Revolution and will never be reconciled to its failure in Cuba." He sternly condemned that the recent open decision by the U.S. Eisenhower administration to send naval and air forces to the Caribbean is another serious step by U.S. imperialism to suppress the revolutionary movements of the world's people and intensify international tensions, which must arouse the high vigilance of the people of the world.

    He expressed his firm belief that the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism will never intimidate the revolutionary Cuban people. He said: "The awakened and united Cuban people will, with the support of peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world, certainly be able to continue to carry forward the revolutionary fighting spirit, overcome all difficulties, defeat all counterattacks by the enemy, and realize their great revolutionary goals." He also pointed out that Cuba's victory has set a brilliant example for the people of Latin America. He emphasized: "The victory of the Cuban people's revolution has once again shattered the superstition about the strength of U.S. imperialism, proving that the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism is essentially just a paper tiger. All oppressed nations and peoples, as long as they unite, dare to win, and are good at struggle, will surely become an invincible force and will surely win their own liberation."

    Wan Li said: "The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Cuban people and the Latin American people as their own struggle, and their victory as their own victory." He concluded: "The struggle of the Cuban people and the Latin American people is a powerful support for the Chinese people, and at the same time we are willing to do our best to support the struggle of the Cuban people and the Latin American people. Six hundred and fifty million Chinese people will always be the most reliable friends of the Cuban people and the Latin American people!"

    Major Guevara was invited to speak at the meeting (full text on page four). At this time, ten thousand people stood up and burst into prolonged thunderous applause. Guevara said that the enthusiasm shown at today's meeting is not the personal enthusiasm shown to us ordinary people, but the affection of the great Chinese nation for the small island of Cuba.

    Guevara proudly spoke of the significant victories achieved by the Cuban Revolution, saying: "For the imperialism that plays with the peace, welfare, and future of the world on the coast opposite Cuba, Cuba has become a very troublesome problem for it." He said that because Cuba has continued to achieve victories in land reform and other areas, "soon this imperialist jackal revealed its face and launched an aggression against the Cuban people. The Cuban people's response to every act of aggression is to take a step forward, take a countermeasure, and make the revolution more and more profound."

    This Cuban revolutionary who has experienced combat, when talking about the work in the years to come, pointed out with full confidence: "The road is difficult, and the coming years will be full of difficulties, but we are not isolated. We are no longer the sardines in the political fable who cannot defend themselves when faced with American sharks."

    He spoke of the firm support and assistance of the people of socialist countries to the Cuban Revolution, saying that the fighting unity of socialist countries has built a solid wall in the face of imperialism.

    He pointed out: "Cuba is located in the backyard of American colonial companies. At the moment when the Cuban Revolution was born, formed, and grew, at the moment when imperialism saw that the final liberation of all peoples was near and obvious, a qualitative leap forward occurred in the Americas."

    Guevara finally praised the great friendship and unity between the people of China and Cuba amidst a storm of applause, saying: "It is precisely because our enemies are common, and our enemies hate us both; it is precisely because we all share a common aspiration for a better world, our friendship will last as long as the snow on the Himalayas."

    After Guevara's speech, Vice Mayor Wan Li presented a banner and gifts to Major Guevara on behalf of the people of the capital. The banner read: "Salute to the Heroic Cuban People! Long Live the Cuban People's Revolution! Long Live the Fighting Friendship Between the People of China and Cuba!"

    After the meeting, cultural and art workers in the capital performed wonderful Chinese and Cuban song and dance programs. (See picture attached)

    首都盛会欢迎古巴政府经济代表团
    周恩来总理、陈毅、李先念副总理出席了大会
    万里副市长说，中国人民将永远是古巴和拉丁美洲人民的最可靠的朋友
    格瓦拉团长说，古巴人民对帝国主义每一次侵略的回答是向前迈进一步
    据新华社21日讯　首都各界人民一万多人今天在人民大会堂举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎来自反对美帝国主义斗争的西方前线的贵宾——古巴国家银行行长埃·切·格瓦拉少校和由他率领的古巴革命政府经济代表团。
    今天的大会充满了热烈的气氛。格瓦拉少校在会上讲话说，古巴人民对帝国主义的每一次侵略的回答是向前迈进一步。古巴绝不是孤立的。中古两国人民因为有共同的敌人，我们的敌人都仇恨我们，中古两国人民因为都对一个更美好的世界怀着共同的愿望，两国人民的友谊将像喜马拉雅山的白雪一样永世长存。北京市副市长万里庄严地表示：六亿五千万中国人民将永远是古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民最可靠的朋友。
    今天会场主席台正中并排高悬中、古两国国旗，会场上挂着用中文和西班牙文写的巨幅标语：“中国、古巴人民友好万岁！”“向英雄的古巴人民致敬！”
    下午四时一刻，在鼓掌声和“七月二十六日”古巴革命进行曲的乐声中，周恩来总理，陈毅、李先念副总理，北京市副市长万里，同格瓦拉少校和古巴革命政府经济代表团团员：外交部行政副部长略姆帕尔特，古巴外贸银行总经理莫拉少校，里卡尔特少校等全体贵宾，走上主席台。一群少先队员向贵宾们献了鲜花。
    在主席台上就座的，还有外交部副部长耿飚，对外贸易部副部长卢绪章，中国驻古巴大使申健，北京市副市长冯基平、吴晗、乐松生，中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南，副会长周而复，以及北京市各方面的负责人。
    在北京的拉丁美洲各国外宾和留学生应邀参加了欢迎大会。
    大会在奏古巴、中国两国国歌声中开始。
    万里在欢迎大会上致词（全文见第四版），他代表首都各界人民向古巴贵宾们表示最热烈的欢迎，并且向英雄的古巴人民致以崇高的兄弟般的战斗敬礼。
    万里热情地赞扬了古巴革命的胜利。他说，中国人民为古巴人民在菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理阁下及其战友们的领导下所取得的胜利，感到万分高兴。他指出：“美帝国主义极端仇视古巴革命，决不甘心于自己在古巴的失败”。他严厉地谴责说，美国艾森豪威尔政府最近公然决定出动海空军部队到加勒比海，是美帝国主义镇压世界人民革命运动和加剧国际紧张局势的又一个严重步骤，必须引起全世界人民的高度警惕。
    他表示坚信，美帝国主义的侵略和干涉决吓不倒革命的古巴人民。他说：“觉醒和团结起来的古巴人民，在全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民的支持下，一定能够继续发扬革命的战斗精神，排除万难，击败敌人的一切反扑，实现自己伟大的革命目标。”他还指出，古巴的胜利，为拉丁美洲人民树立了光辉的榜样。他强调说：“古巴人民革命的胜利，又一次破除了对美帝国主义力量的迷信，证明貌似强大的美帝国主义实质上不过是一只纸老虎。一切被压迫的民族和人民，只要团结起来，敢于胜利，善于斗争，就一定能够成为不可战胜的力量，就一定能够赢得自己的解放。”
    万里说：“中国人民一向把古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争，把他们的胜利看作是自己的胜利”。他最后说：“古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民的斗争是对中国人民的有力支持，同时我们也愿意尽自己的力量来支持古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民的斗争。六亿五千万中国人民将永远是古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民最可靠的朋友！”
    格瓦拉少校应邀在大会上讲话（全文见第四版），这时万人起立，发出长时间的雷鸣般的掌声。格瓦拉说，今天大会所表现的热情，不是对于我们这些普普通通的人所表现出来的私人之间的热情，而是表现了伟大的中华民族向古巴这个小岛所寄予的情意。
    格瓦拉自豪地谈到古巴革命所取得的重大胜利，他说：“对于在古巴海岸对面的玩弄世界的和平、福利和前途的帝国主义说来，古巴已成为使它感到非常头痛的问题。”他说，由于古巴在土地改革等方面不断取得胜利，“很快地这条帝国主义豺狼露出了它的嘴脸，发动了对古巴人民的侵略。古巴人民对每一次侵略的回答是向前迈进一步，采取一个反措施并使革命愈来愈深刻。”
    这位经历过战斗的古巴的革命者在谈到将来岁月中的工作时，他满怀信心地指出：“道路是艰难的，将来的几年里将充满困难，但是我们并不是孤立的。我们已经不是政治寓言里面的面临美国鲨鱼而不能保卫自己的沙丁鱼了。”
    他谈到了社会主义各国人民对古巴革命的坚决支持和援助，他说，社会主义各国的战斗团结，已经在帝国主义的面前筑起了一道坚实的城墙。
    他指出：“古巴是处在美国殖民公司的后院，在古巴革命诞生、形成和成长的时刻，在帝国主义看到各国人民最后解放已经接近和明显的时刻，在美洲发生了质的前进。”
    格瓦拉最后在暴风雨般的掌声中热情地赞扬了中古两国人民的伟大友谊和团结，他说：“正是因为我们的敌人是共同的，我们的敌人都仇恨我们；正是因为我们都对一个更美好的世界怀着共同的愿望，我们的友谊将像喜马拉雅山的白雪一样永世长存。”
    格瓦拉讲话以后，万里副市长代表首都人民向格瓦拉少校献旗、赠礼。锦旗上写道：“向英雄的古巴人民致敬！古巴人民革命万岁！中古两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”
    大会结束以后，首都文艺工作者演出了中国和古巴的精采歌舞节目。（附图片）
