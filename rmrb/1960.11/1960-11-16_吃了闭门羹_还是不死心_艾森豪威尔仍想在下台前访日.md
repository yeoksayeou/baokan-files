Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 15th: Eisenhower, who was given the cold shoulder by the Japanese people this June, is not willing to give up and still wants to "visit" Japan in the near future.

White House Press Secretary Hagerty announced to reporters on the 14th that Eisenhower still "hopes to visit Japan," but cannot be sure whether he will make this trip before he leaves office on January 20th next year.

Agence France-Presse reported that the outgoing American president "will do everything possible to include this visit in his packed schedule for the next two months."

    吃了闭门羹  还是不死心
    艾森豪威尔仍想在下台前访日
    据新华社15日讯  华盛顿消息：今年6月被日本人民飨以闭门羹的艾森豪威尔不肯死心，还想在不久以后去日本“访问”。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂14日对新闻记者宣布，艾森豪威尔仍然“希望访问日本”，但是还不能肯定是否在他明年1月20日下台前作这一次旅行。
    法新社在报道这一消息时认为，这个即将下台的美国总统“将会竭全力把这个访问列入他在今后两个月的排得满满的日程表中”。
