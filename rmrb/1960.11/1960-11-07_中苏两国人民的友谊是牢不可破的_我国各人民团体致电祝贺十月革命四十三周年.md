The path of the October Revolution is the only way for the proletariat and working people of all countries to get rid of oppression and exploitation and strive for freedom and liberation. Under the glorious light of the October Revolution, the working class and working people of the world are now engaged in a victorious struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism.

"For forty-three years, the great Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have achieved brilliant achievements in socialist and communist construction, and in recent years have left the United States far behind in the latest science and technology. The Chinese working class and people have always regarded the achievements of the Soviet working class and people as their own achievements and have been greatly encouraged by them.

"The Chinese people, advancing along the road of the great October Socialist Revolution, are now accelerating socialist construction. The Chinese and Soviet people have a common great ideal of communism. In order to realize this ideal, in order to oppose our common enemy of imperialism headed by the United States, we have formed an indestructible fraternal friendship and unity. The Chinese working class and people have always regarded safeguarding and strengthening the unity between the Chinese and Soviet people and the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union as their sacred internationalist duty. We firmly believe that the friendship and unity between our two peoples based on Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism, and the Moscow Declaration is eternal and cannot be destroyed by any force.

"I wish the Soviet people new and greater achievements in the cause of communist construction and in the struggle to defend world peace."
"May the indestructible fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and the working class last forever."
