Grasping production with one hand and life with the other:

Production and life are interdependent, mutually influential, and mutually promoting. Only with the development of production can life be improved; conversely, the improvement of life will vigorously promote the development of production. If we only focus on production and do not care about the lives of the masses, and do not seriously solve the practical problems in the lives of the masses, it will affect production. We have now entered the cold winter season, and the actual living problems of the people need to be well arranged; the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to seize a full year of success is increasing day by day, and production is constantly reaching new highs. Party organizations at all levels must put grasping life in an important position in their leadership work, and promote the sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in production by comprehensively arranging the people's economic life. Grasping life is a matter of grasping the relations of production, and the relations of production, under certain conditions, play a major and decisive role in the development of productive forces. Grasping life well now is not only an important guarantee for the victorious completion of this year's production tasks, but also an important condition for achieving a sustained and comprehensive Great Leap Forward in production next year.

Arranging the lives of the masses includes many aspects such as food, clothing, and fuel. The experience of many units has proved that to run public canteens well, the secretary must take the lead and implement "politics entering the canteen and cadres going to the kitchen." Therefore, party committees at all levels must go deep into the front line of life, into the canteens, eat, live, work, discuss with the canteen staff, share weal and woe with the masses, and study with the masses how to manage and use grain and vegetables well, and establish and improve a set of management systems to improve the work of the canteens. In all work, people are the decisive factor. To run a canteen well, it is necessary to do a good job in the work of people, and it is necessary to send capable cadres to manage the canteen.

The masses' problems of eating and clothing, firewood, rice, oil, and salt are very complex. Arranging the lives of the masses must be deep, meticulous, realistic, and comprehensive. We must study, inspect, and summarize regularly. Some units have formed a system for grasping life, and like grasping production, the party committee regularly studies life problems, and the secretary and administrative负责人 (responsible person) regularly go deep into the front line of life in a planned way, and jointly study the problems in life with the masses, canteen managers, and cooks; and while going deep into life, they understand the production situation, and while going deep into production, they understand the life situation, and combine leading production with organizing life. We must promote this approach, grasp life in a thorough and meticulous manner, and make it regular and systematic.

### 一手抓生产　一手抓生活

    一手抓生产　一手抓生活
    生产和生活是互相依存，互相影响，互相促进的。只有生产发展了，才能改善生活；反过来，生活改善了，又会有力地促进生产的发展。如果只抓生产不关心群众生活，不认真解决群众生活中的实际问题，就会对生产发生影响。当前已进入寒冬季节，人民群众的实际生活问题需要很好的安排；广大职工夺取全年满堂红的劳动热情日益高涨，生产不断出现新高潮。各级党组织必须把抓生活摆在领导工作的重要地位上来，通过全面安排好人民经济生活，推动生产持续全面大跃进。抓生活是属于抓生产关系的问题，生产关系在一定条件之下，对发展生产力起着主要的决定的作用。抓好当前生活，不仅是胜利完成今年生产任务的重要保证，而且也是实现明年生产持续全面大跃进的重要条件。
    安排群众生活包括吃穿烧用许多方面。许多单位的经验证明，办好公共食堂必须书记挂帅，实行“政治进食堂，干部下厨房”。因此，各级党委必须深入生活第一线，深入食堂，同食堂工作人员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，同群众同甘共苦，和群众一起研究管好用好粮食、蔬菜，并建立健全一套管理制度，改进食堂工作。在一切工作中人是决定的因素。办好食堂必须做好人的工作，必须派得力干部去管理食堂。
    群众的吃饭穿衣问题，柴米油盐问题，是个十分复杂的事情。安排群众生活必须抓深、抓细、抓实、抓全。要经常研究，经常检查总结。有的单位把抓生活形成制度，和抓生产一样，党委会定期研究生活问题，书记、行政负责人有计划地经常地深入生活第一线，同群众、同食堂管理人员和炊事人员共同研究生活当中的问题；并且在深入生活的同时了解生产情况，深入生产同时了解生活情况，把领导生产和组织生活结合起来。我们必须推广这种做法，深入细致地抓生活，并使之经常化制度化。
