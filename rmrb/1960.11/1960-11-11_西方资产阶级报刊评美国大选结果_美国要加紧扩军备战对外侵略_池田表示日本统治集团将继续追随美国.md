Xinhua News Agency, 10th November — Bourgeois newspapers and news agencies in the United States and Western Europe, commenting on the outcome of the US election, indicated that the election of Kennedy as President of the United States would not alter the fundamental policies of the US government and that he would continue to intensify the policy of arms expansion, war preparations, and foreign expansion and aggression. Many newspapers also acknowledged that in the current international situation, the new US government will face many difficulties.

The US Information Agency, an official US propaganda body, published a commentary on November 9 stating that Kennedy "has repeatedly expressed opposition to communism and its influence" and that the Democratic platform has declared that its goal is not to "coexist" with the socialist camp on one planet.

Associated Press reporter Haytower said that it is expected that Kennedy will not change US foreign policy. He said that Kennedy himself has indicated that in dealing with the Soviet Union, "the primary task is to strengthen the United States' position of strength in the world, and he will focus on this issue in the first few months of his term."

An Associated Press dispatch from Washington said that "US experts are confident that Kennedy's election as master of the White House will also not bring about significant changes in US policy toward Europe (Western Europe)." Agence France-Presse reported that "Kennedy has decided to maintain the Atlantic Alliance... and has said that US troops will continue to be stationed in (West) Berlin and West Germany." The news agency also pointed out that in dealing with nationally independent countries, "naturally Kennedy will oppose" Cuba, and "the new government will pay special attention to Africa." United Press International reporter Potts believes that after Kennedy takes office, he will continue to pursue the policy of occupying China's territory of Taiwan and intensify the creation of "two Chinas."

The "New York Times," in summarizing Kennedy's foreign policy proposals, said that the two presidential candidates largely agreed on most basic issues. Thus, it stated that America's "friends abroad" can be confident that the aims of American foreign policy will remain unchanged.

It is reported that after the news of Kennedy's election, the stock market prices of stocks related to the arms industry, especially companies manufacturing aircraft and missiles, immediately rose. The Associated Press acknowledged that "this is the result of Wall Street's anticipation of even larger defense (referring to military) spending."

According to Western news agencies, in London, "Western diplomats' initial estimates (also) are that they do not expect major changes in US policy." In Paris, "the general feeling is that US foreign policy will continue." In Bonn, Christian Democratic parliamentary leader Krone said that the West German government and the Christian Democrats believe that they "can happily and confidently anticipate cooperation with the new president."

Some US and Western European newspapers and news agencies also pointed out the many difficulties facing Kennedy. Deutsche Presse-Agentur said that Kennedy's election background was: "The setbacks suffered by the United States in international affairs—from the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite to the Soviet Union's space rocket, from the U-2 incident to the breakdown of the Paris summit, from Eisenhower's cancellation of his visit to Japan to the events in Cuba—have left an impression in the minds of the American public." "It seems that people have gradually realized that the prestige of the United States has actually declined in recent years." United Press International reporter Hansley said that Kennedy faces "difficult and complex tasks."

An Agence France-Presse dispatch said, "The President-elect will take office at a difficult moment in American and world history," noting that Kennedy will face many domestic problems, including the US economic crisis, increased unemployment, and gold outflows. The British "Times" also said, "Kennedy will encounter a more depressed economy at a time when people are doubting the dollar and gold continues to flow out... The difficulty is that any efforts by the authorities to revive the economy, whether by increasing government spending, lowering interest rates, or both, will weaken the defense of the dollar abroad."

Xinhua News Agency, November 10th — Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese ruling clique unanimously expressed its desire to continue to follow the United States and strengthen its dependence on the United States.

Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda said at a press conference held in Sasebo City on the afternoon of November 9: The Democratic Party's foreign policy is "fundamentally the same" as the Republican Party's. After quoting Kennedy's advocacy of "policy of strength," he said that America's future "foreign policy will probably be almost no different from the Ike era."

Ikeda stated that he would further yield to the United States and rely on the United States to intensify expansion into "underdeveloped countries." He said: The United States "will jointly assist underdeveloped countries with Japan in the future, and will strengthen this work. Therefore, we must further strengthen Japan-US relations in the future."

Ikeda stated that in order to expand abroad, it is necessary to "consolidate the domestic system," that is, to strengthen the militarist and fascist rule domestically.

According to "Tokyo Shimbun," in order to exchange views with US government leaders on the "international situation and Japan-US cooperation," Hayato Ikeda has decided to visit the United States as soon as possible after the election.

    西方资产阶级报刊评美国大选结果
    美国要加紧扩军备战对外侵略
    池田表示日本统治集团将继续追随美国
    据新华社10日讯　美国和西欧国家资产阶级报刊和通讯社在评论美国大选的结果时表明，肯尼迪当选美国总统并不会使美国政府的基本政策有所改变，他将继续加紧推行扩军备战和向外扩张侵略的政策。许多报刊同时承认，在当前的国际形势下，美国的新政府将面临重重的困难。
    美国官方宣传机构美国新闻处9日发表一篇评论说，肯尼迪“在一次又一次的讲话中已表示反对共产主义及其影响”，民主党的纲领已经宣称，它的目标不是同社会主义阵营在一个星球上“共处”。
    美联社记者海托华说，人们预料肯尼迪不会改变美国的外交政策。他说，肯尼迪本人已经表明，在对待苏联的问题上，“首要的任务是加强美国在世界上的实力地位，而他将在就职的头几个月中集中处理这个问题。”
    美联社从华盛顿发出的一条消息说，“美国专家们确信，肯尼迪当选白宫的主人也将不会使美国对欧洲（西欧）的政策有显著改变。”法新社报道说，“肯尼迪已经决定维持大西洋联盟……并且已经说美国军队将继续驻在（西）柏林和西德。”这个通讯社还指出，在对待民族独立国家的问题上，“自然肯尼迪将反对”古巴，此外“新政府将特别注意非洲”。合众国际社记者波茨认为，肯尼迪上任后将继续推行霸占中国的领土台湾并加紧制造“两个中国”的政策。
      “纽约时报”在概括肯尼迪的外交政策主张时说，两党总统候选人在大多数基本问题上，意见在很大程度上都是一致的。因而它表示，美国“在国外的朋友”可以相信，美国外交政策的目的将继续不变。
    据报道，肯尼迪当选的消息传出后，美国股票市场上同军火工业有关的股票，特别是制造飞机和导弹的企业的股票，立即涨价。美联社承认，“这是华尔街预料用于防御的（指军事）开支将更形庞大”的结果。
    据西方通讯社说，在伦敦，“西方外交家的初步估计（也）是，他们预料美国的政策不会有重大改变。”在巴黎，“一般的感觉是，美国的外交政策将继续下去。”在波恩，基督教民主党议会领袖克罗内说，西德政府和基督教民主党人认为，他们“可以愉快地和信赖地预期同这位新总统合作。”
    美国和西欧的一些报刊和通讯社同时指出了肯尼迪面临的重重困难。德意志新闻社说，肯尼迪当选的背景是：“美国在国际事务方面所遭到的挫折——从苏联发射第一颗人造卫星到苏联的宇宙火箭，从U—2事件到巴黎最高级会议的破裂，从艾森豪威尔取消访日之行到古巴发生的事件——在美国公众的心里打上了烙印。”“看来，人们已逐渐认识到美国威望实际上已在最近几年来下降”。合众国际社记者汉斯莱说，肯尼迪面临着“艰苦而复杂的任务”。
    法新社一条消息说，“当选总统将在美国和世界历史上的一个困难时刻就职”，消息指出肯尼迪将面对许多内政问题，其中主要的有美国经济危机、失业增加、黄金外流等。英国“泰晤士报”也说，
  “肯尼迪将在人们对美元发生怀疑和黄金继续外流的这样一个时候会碰到一种比较萧条的经济……困难在于，当局方面恢复经济的任何努力，不论是增加政府开支，还是降低利率，还是两者一并实行，都将削弱在国外对美元的保卫。”
    据新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本统治集团一致表示要继续追随美国，加强它对美国的从属关系。
    日本首相池田勇人9日下午在佐世保市举行的记者招待会上说：民主党的外交政策同共和党“在根本上是相同的”。他在引用肯尼迪鼓吹“实力政策”的言论后说，美国今后的“外交政策恐怕同艾克时代几乎完全不会有什么不同”。
    池田表示今后要进一步屈从美国，依靠美国来加紧向“不发达国家”进行扩张。他说：美国“今后将同日本一起对不发达国家进行援助，并且会加强这个工作。因此，今后要越发加强日美关系”。
    池田表示，为了对外扩张，要“巩固国内体制”，即在国内加强军国主义的法西斯统治。
    据“东京新闻”透露，为了同美国政府首脑交换关于“国际形势和日美合作”的意见，池田勇人决定要在大选结束后尽可能早地访问美国。
