Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, November 18th: A Chinese arts and crafts exhibition, organized by the Kandy branch of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association, opened in the Ceylonese mountain city of Kandy tonight. The opening ceremony of the exhibition was presided over by the wife of the Ceylonese Minister of Trade, Commerce, Shipping and Food, Mr. Ilangaratne.

Ananda Kumara, Secretary of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association, said at the opening ceremony that this exhibition vividly demonstrates the great achievements made by Chinese artists with the help of the People's Government. What people can see from this exhibition once again refutes all the rumors and slanders made by the imperialists against China.

Chinese Ambassador to Ceylon, Zhang Canming, said in his speech that he hoped that the people of the two countries could exchange their experiences in arts and crafts through such exhibitions, so as to learn from each other and further develop the friendship between the two countries.
