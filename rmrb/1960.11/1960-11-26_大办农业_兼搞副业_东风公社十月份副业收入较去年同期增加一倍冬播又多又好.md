Vigorously Develop Agriculture and Engage in Sideline Production
    Dongfeng Commune's October Sideline Income Doubles Compared to the Same Period Last Year; Winter Planting is Both Extensive and High-Quality

    (Our newspaper, Changsha, 25th dispatch) Hunan's Changde County's Dongfeng Commune, in developing sideline production, adheres to the principle of "less sideline work during busy farming seasons, more during slack seasons," vigorously developing collective sideline production mainly by the brigade (basic accounting unit, same below), while also helping members develop small-scale household sideline production, making sideline production a regular activity. In the first ten months of this year, the cash income from sideline production at all levels below the production brigade alone amounted to more than 850,000 yuan (excluding the income from collectively operated sideline production by the commune), averaging more than 53 yuan per member household. This ensures income every month, wages every month, and pocket money for every family. Due to the implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link," making comprehensive plans, and rationally arranging labor, the commune has achieved a dual leap forward in agriculture and sideline production. Since October, the sideline income grabbed by the commune during the winter slack season has more than doubled compared to the same period last year; winter-sown crops have reached more than 10,000 mu, an increase of 35% compared to the same period last year, and more than 6.12 million dan of fertilizer has been accumulated, with more than 30,000 mu of winter crops having been fertilized once. Winter crops are generally growing well.

    Dongfeng Commune, located in a hilly area, is a large commune with more than 16,000 households. With mountains and rivers, there are many avenues for sideline production. Sideline income has always accounted for a large proportion of farmers' income. Historically, farmers have had the habit of seizing sideline production during the winter slack season. Therefore, after the autumn harvest basically ended in late September, the commune Party committee held a special meeting to study the issue of developing sideline production in accordance with local conditions. Through mobilization at all levels, full discussion, laying out favorable conditions, calculating detailed income accounts, unified planning, and specific arrangements for farm work and labor, plans for developing sideline production were made at all levels. After the autumn harvest, in addition to concentrating the main labor force on the front line to strengthen the cultivation of winter crops, the commune arranged about 25% of the labor force to vigorously engage in sideline production. In the management of sideline operations, under the unified leadership of the commune, with the brigade as the basis, the system of "two unifications," "three guarantees," and "five fixings" was implemented to carry out sideline production activities. "Two unifications" means the commune unifies planning and unifies leadership. "Three guarantees" means the production brigade guarantees work, guarantees income, and guarantees costs to the sideline production team. "Five fixings" means fixing leaders, fixing labor, fixing work points, fixing time, and fixing quality, while also implementing overproduction rewards. In terms of business scope, in accordance with national plans and the principle of adapting to local conditions, the scope of sideline occupations was specifically divided, and policies were conscientiously implemented in many ways to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members to carry out sideline production. For example, small-scale sideline occupations such as processing straw ropes from rice straw are organized and contracted by the work group (or canteen) with semi-labor. Members use their spare time to raise pigs and poultry, and carry out household small-scale sideline production activities. Now, there are 580 member households in the entire commune, each raising one pig. 80% of member families also raise chickens and ducks, and plant various crops on their private plots. Many members also use their spare time and holidays to go to the mountains to collect wild plants and go to the lakes to fish and shrimp, launching a "small autumn harvest" movement.

    In carrying out sideline production, in addition to overall planning and strengthening specific leadership, the commune Party committee has also carried out much specific and meticulous organizational work. October is the season for picking wild plants, and the commune Party committee organized three major shock efforts, collecting more than 60,000 jin of wild starch, oil, and other products. The commune Party committee also worked with commercial departments to help each production brigade link production and sales, and promote new technical experiences. For sideline projects with strong technical requirements, dedicated personnel are fixed to operate them, giving full play to the members' expertise. The Erli Production Brigade selected six members with experience in fishing and shrimp to guide members in fishing and shrimp. Under the implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link," in order to solve the current labor problem in developing sideline production, the commune Party committee adopted the method of mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out tool reforms, launching a high-efficiency movement. For example, after the Xingfeng Brigade vigorously reformed canteen tools, it extracted 57 laborers from welfare undertakings to invest in sideline production.

    大办农业  兼搞副业
    东风公社十月份副业收入较去年同期增加一倍冬播又多又好
    本报长沙25日电　湖南常德县东风公社在开展副业生产中，根据“农忙少搞、农闲多搞”的原则，大力发展以大队（基本核算单位，下同）为主的集体副业生产，同时帮助社员开展小型家庭副业生产，使得副业生产经常化。今年头十个月，仅生产大队以下各级的副业现金收入就有八十五万多元（还不包括公社集体经营副业收入），平均每户社员收入五十三元多。做到了月月有收入，月月发工资，家家有零用钱。由于贯彻执行以粮为纲的方针，作好了全面规划，合理安排了劳动力，这个公社出现了农、副业双跃进的局面。10月份以来，全社利用冬闲抓回的副业收入较去年同期增加一倍多；冬播农作物一万多亩，较去年同期增加35％，还积肥六百一十二万多担，有三万多亩冬季作物已追肥一次。冬季作物普遍生长良好。
    处于丘陵地区的东风公社是一个有一万六千多户的大社。有山有水，副业门路多。副业收入一向在农民收入中占很大比重。历史上农民就有利用冬闲抓副业生产的习惯。因此，9月下旬秋收基本结束后，公社党委会就召开了专门会议，研究了因地制宜开展副业生产的问题。通过层层发动，充分讨论，摆有利条件、算收入细账，统一规划，具体安排农活和劳力，层层作出开展副业生产的规划。秋收后，全社除了把主要劳动力集中安排到第一线，加强培育冬季作物外，安排了25％左右的劳动力大抓副业生产。在副业经营管理上，在公社统一领导下，以大队为基础，实行社、队分管，采取“二统”、“三包”、“五定”的办法，开展副业生产活动。“二统”即公社统一规划、统一领导。“三包”是生产大队向副业生产队包工、包收入、包成本。“五定”是定领导、定劳力、定工分、定时间、定质量，同时实行超产奖励。在经营范围上，根据国家计划和因地制宜的原则，具体划分了副业的范围，从多方面认真贯彻政策，调动广大社员开展副业生产的积极性。比如，利用稻草加工草索等小宗副业，就由作业组（或食堂）组织半劳动力包干经营。社员利用工余时间养猪养家禽，开展家庭小副业生产活动。现在，全社已有五百八十户社员，每户养猪一头。还有80％的社员家庭养了鸡鸭，并在自留地上种上了各种农作物。许多社员还利用工余和假日，上山采集野生植物，下湖捞鱼虾，开展“小秋收”运动。
    在开展副业生产中，公社党委除了全面规划，加强具体领导外，并进行了许多具体细致的组织工作。10月份正是野生植物的采摘季节，公社党委组织了三次大突击，采回野生淀粉、油料等产品共六万多斤。公社党委还协同商业部门帮助各生产大队进行产销挂钩，推广新的技术经验。对于技术性较强的副业项目，都固定专人经营，充分发挥社员的特长。二里生产大队就选出六名有捕捞鱼虾经验的社员指导社员捞鱼虾。在贯彻执行以粮为纲的方针下，如何解决当前开展副业生产中劳力问题，公社党委采取了发动群众大搞工具改革的办法，开展高工效运动。如幸丰大队大搞食堂工具改革后，就从福利事业人员中抽出五十七个劳动力投入副业生产。
