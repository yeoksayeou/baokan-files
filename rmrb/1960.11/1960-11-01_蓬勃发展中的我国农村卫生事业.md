Flourishing Rural Health Work in China
Li Dequan, Minister of Public Health

Since the founding of the country, especially in the recent two years, China's rural health work, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, has closely coordinated with production and served production, achieving great success.

After the rural people's communes were established, the strong vitality and unparalleled superiority of the people's communes not only promoted the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and rural industry, but also promoted the comprehensive prosperity of rural education, science, culture, health, and other undertakings. In the field of rural health, a rural health care network closely integrated with production, combining large, medium, and small scales, integrating Chinese and Western medicine, and combining personnel detached from production with those not detached from production has been initially established from the county to the production team. In 1959, the number of beds in county hospitals nationwide (including simple beds) increased by more than 80% compared to before communization; the number of people's commune hospitals, maternity hospitals, and health clinics reached over 200,000, more than double the number of grassroots health organizations in rural areas before communization, with the number of beds increasing by about four times. In terms of the layout of health institutions, various regions have generally moved towards rationality and balance. The rural medical and health teams are also expanding rapidly. According to 1959 statistics, there were more than one million health personnel in hospitals and health stations (clinics). In addition, there are millions of mass health work backbones and activists who are not detached from production. In the organizational construction of rural health, in recent years, the construction of county hospitals has been vigorously strengthened. First, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over county hospitals, strengthened the backbone of Party leadership, strengthened political and ideological work, and improved the ideological awareness of health personnel. In addition, they have been strengthened in terms of technical personnel, medical equipment, and basic construction, so that county hospitals have gradually become the center of health business and technical guidance and the base for training cadres in the county, promoting the rapid improvement of the overall level of rural medical care. At present, the equipment conditions and business and technical level of county hospitals nationwide have been greatly improved. Many county hospitals across the country can perform general abdominal surgery, and some commune hospitals can perform lower abdominal surgery. More than 60% of county hospitals and some commune hospitals across the country have established intermediate or primary health schools, and have held various short-term training courses and spare-time schools to actively train and improve rural health personnel.

In order to adapt to the requirements of rural people's communes and the continuous leap forward in agricultural production, many areas have implemented a collective health care system (that is, according to the level of production development and the voluntariness of the masses in various places, the medical expenses for commune members to see a doctor are resolved by members paying a certain "health care fee" each year, supplemented by subsidies from the public welfare fund of the commune, and used for unified allocation). At present, this system has been widely implemented in many areas of Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Shanghai, Guizhou, Xinjiang and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and has been warmly welcomed by the majority of commune members. Commune members praised: "Implementing collective health care is a good way to prevent and treat diseases, mutual assistance and cooperation to protect health, and great enthusiasm for production leaps forward."

The continuous progress of the above-mentioned tasks has also directly and powerfully promoted the development of the health movement. In recent years, the mass health movement centered on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating major diseases has made great progress. Especially after the Party Central Committee issued instructions on health work this spring, in the rural areas across the country, due to the personal leadership of Party committee secretaries at all levels, widespread mobilization of the masses, and further strengthening of technical guidance by the majority of rural health personnel, a new upsurge of the vigorous mass health movement has been set off. In the movement, advanced health areas have expanded rapidly, advanced health units have continued to increase, and the advanced experience of Jishan, the national health red flag county, in carrying out health work has also been rapidly promoted in various places. Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have all produced their own "Jishan." On the basis of the brilliant achievements already achieved, the people of Jishan, under the resounding slogan of "learning from the sun, catching up with the sun," continue to learn from the experience of the health model village – Taiyang Village, and are determined to raise the red flag higher and higher, and march towards new and higher standards. With the concerted efforts of the whole Party and the whole people, the rural health outlook has been further improved, the four pests have been significantly reduced, the health work and labor protection of the first line of field and construction site production have been strengthened, and the health work of public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens has been significantly improved; many areas have controlled the occurrence and spread of seasonal infectious diseases, and the work of eliminating parasitic diseases and endemic diseases has also been accelerated. Some areas have also carried out large-scale prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. Taking the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, which is the most serious threat to people's health, as an example, more than 5 million patients have been treated in recent years, and most of the patients have been cured, which has provided millions of laborers to the production front. In terms of prevention and treatment of endemic diseases, Shaanxi Province treated 610,000 patients in half a year, of which more than 440,000 have recovered their health and returned to their production posts. The incidence of seasonal infectious diseases has also been declining year by year, and many areas and units without infectious diseases have appeared.

The rapid development of rural health and the results of the large-scale health movement to eliminate pests and diseases have effectively protected the labor force, improved the labor attendance rate and labor efficiency, supported and promoted agricultural production, and also greatly changed the people's lives and mental outlook in the vast rural areas. In the past, the epidemic areas, which were sparsely populated and the fields were barren, are now filled with songs of labor, everyone is healthy, and everyone is full of energy, presenting a prosperous and joyful scene of "increased production in the fields, increased longevity for people, and prosperity of livestock." Due to the development of mass prevention and health care work, the incidence of diseases has been reduced, physical fitness has been enhanced, and labor attendance rate and labor efficiency have been improved. For example, after Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province eliminated schistosomiasis, the amount of land cultivated by each labor force increased from two mu to more than ten mu, and labor efficiency increased by about five times. Jieshou County in Anhui Province not only eliminated several parasitic diseases such as kala-azar, hookworm disease, filariasis, and malaria, which seriously harmed the local people, and provided a large number of laborers for the agricultural production front, but also has not had an epidemic of infectious diseases since December 1959, which has powerfully guaranteed and promoted the continuous leap forward in production. Jishan County, the national health red flag, is a model of simultaneous leaps forward in production and health. The county eliminated nine common and endemic diseases, the labor attendance rate is often maintained above 98%, and production has been increasing year by year.

Due to the development of medical and health institutions, the improvement of the ideological awareness of health and medical personnel, and the implementation of the collective health care system, it is possible to better and more timely relieve the suffering of diseases for the broad masses of peasants and achieve "early prevention without disease and early treatment with disease." For example, many areas have greatly strengthened the forefront of health work in supporting agriculture due to the vigorous construction of rural medical and health organizations centered on county hospitals. This can not only better support agricultural production and protect the labor force, but also has important significance for building a new socialist countryside and changing the cultural, scientific, and technological outlook of the countryside. In terms of women and children's health care, many places have completely eliminated women's ideological concerns about participating in production because of good women's labor protection and well-run maternity hospitals, kindergartens, and nurseries. For example, the Maternal and Child Welfare Paradise in Daye People's Commune, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, has saved a total of 31,905 workdays in the year and a half since its establishment, which is equivalent to increasing more than 110 full laborers to invest in production. Carrying out the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene has also carried out harmless treatment of human and animal feces, garbage, and sewage, which can both increase fertilizer accumulation, improve fertilizer efficiency, and eliminate breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, so as to achieve the purpose of eliminating pests and preventing diseases, which is greatly beneficial to production. With good health work, livestock diseases have been greatly reduced, the attendance rate is high, reproduction is fast, and they are fat and strong. These facts fully demonstrate that: health work is a positive factor in promoting production and an important measure to ensure production. As long as health work adheres to starting from the development of production, coordinating with production, and serving production, carrying out health work will certainly be able to better develop production.

In order to better exert the role of rural health work in promoting agricultural production, and in response to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to vigorously develop agriculture and grain, in the upsurge of all walks of life supporting agriculture, the vast number of rural health and medical personnel across the country are more enthusiastic and demand greater achievements on the basis of the achievements already achieved in the past. They have rushed to the front line of production, deep into the fields, construction sites, and collective production and living units such as public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, to eliminate the four pests, promote hygiene, prevent and treat various diseases, and do everything possible to protect the health of the labor force and support agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Sichuan, Henan, Guizhou, Jiangsu, Qinghai, Jiangxi, Hubei and other provinces, there are about 500,000 health personnel at all levels fighting on the front line of production, ensuring that where production is tight, medical and health personnel go to support it, and where the labor force goes, health personnel follow. In Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, 80% of the health personnel took medical equipment and production tools to camp in the "Fangtian" (square fields), forming a relatively sound medical and health care network in the fields, so that commune members could treat minor illnesses and injuries without leaving the "Fangtian". They also held health spare-time schools and health knowledge lectures in the "Fangtian", training and retraining more than 75,000 mass health backbones on the spot, and nearly 150,000 commune members participated in the study of health knowledge. Xining City, Qinghai Province, moved two outpatient departments in the city as a whole to the countryside, strengthening the health and medical forces on the production front. In order to comprehensively strengthen the health work on the front line, the health department of Shanxi Province put forward the resounding slogan of "'Four Preventions' and 'Five Graspings' to ensure full attendance and support the Great Leap Forward in production," and made the health work on the front line more in-depth and meticulous. The so-called "Four Preventions" are to prevent diseases, injuries, heatstroke, and poisoning, to ensure the health and safety of the labor force, and to improve the labor attendance rate and labor efficiency. The so-called "Five Graspings" are to grasp five measures: vigorously grasp health publicity and education, popularize health knowledge; grasp the health work in collective production and life; grasp technical innovation and technical revolution; grasp the management of green manure accumulation and feces, garbage, and sewage; grasp the arrangement of work and rest. After health personnel went deep into the front line of production, they generally did their best to prevent and treat diseases, participate in labor, publicize health knowledge, and train mass health backbones. They also insisted on eating, living, working, discussing, and doing hygiene with the commune members. As a result, they not only greatly strengthened the health work on the front line of production and the "one-dragon" collective life centered on the canteen, making health work and production and life more closely integrated, and powerfully guaranteed and promoted the development of production, but also greatly strengthened the relationship between health personnel and the masses, and enabled health personnel to be tempered and improve their ideological awareness in the process of participating in labor production and practical work. More and more health personnel have established the idea of ​​loving the countryside, loving labor, and serving the peasants wholeheartedly. They are determined to be red in the countryside, specialized in the countryside, settle down in the countryside, and contribute all their energy and technology to the great cause of building rural people's communes.

In the movement of health departments to support agriculture, urban medical and health departments in various places have also widely adopted the forms of counterpart cooperation and fixed support, vigorously supporting the construction of rural medical and health organizations centered on county hospitals in many aspects such as human resources, materials, teaching technology, and training cadres. More than 200 urban hospitals in Liaoning Province respectively cooperated with 41 county hospitals and 460 commune hospitals, and implemented the method of "fixed support, one package to the end, and comprehensive cooperation." Jiangsu Province adopted the method of organizing guidance and cooperation groups with one city as the main body to package one special area or several counties, and organized 35 urban hospitals and 5 military hospitals in the province to establish comprehensive cooperation and guidance relations with 46 county hospitals and some commune hospitals respectively, so that the work level of the supported county and commune hospitals was rapidly and comprehensively improved. The establishment of this new cooperative relationship between urban and rural health work is the inevitable product of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and is also the result of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's idea of ​​developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation becoming increasingly popular. It shines with the brilliance of our great era.

Although China's rural health work has achieved great success, this is only a good start to our rural people's commune health work. In order to meet the requirements of accelerated development of agricultural production, our rural health and medical personnel must make long-term unremitting efforts, and must make significant achievements within three years. All our rural health and medical personnel must better complete these new tasks before us, and must more deeply and consciously implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, closely coordinate with the ongoing production increase and economy movement centered on grain and steel in various places, further carry out extensive mass health movements, continue to vigorously strengthen the construction of rural medical and health organizations centered on county hospitals, widely mobilize all Chinese and Western medical and health personnel, go deep into the front line of production, and push the movement of the medical and health front to support agriculture to a new climax. Under the current excellent situation, all health personnel must make persistent efforts, resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the masses, earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, especially study the works of Chairman Mao, continue to strengthen ideological transformation, muster greater efforts, and make greater contributions to supporting agriculture.

    蓬勃发展中的我国农村卫生事业
    卫生部部长  李德全
    建国以来特别是最近两年来，我国农村卫生工作，在党中央、毛主席的正确领导下，在党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的照耀下，紧密配合生产，为生产服务，取得了巨大的成就。
    农村人民公社化后，人民公社的强大生命力和无比优越性，不仅促进了农林牧副渔和农村工业的全面大发展，同时也促进了农村教育、科学、文化、卫生等各项事业的全面繁荣。在农村卫生事业方面，目前，从县到生产队，一个和生产紧密结合，大中小结合，中西医结合，脱离生产人员和不脱离生产人员结合的农村卫生医疗保健网已初步建立起来。1959年全国县医院病床（包括简易病床）比公社化前增长80％以上；人民公社医院、产院、卫生所已达二十万所以上，比公社化前农村基层卫生组织增长一倍以上，床位增长约四倍。在卫生机构的布局上，各地一般已渐趋于合理和平衡。农村的医药卫生队伍也在迅速扩大，据1959年的统计，医院和保健站（所）卫生人员已达一百万人以上。另外，还有数百万不脱离生产的群众卫生工作骨干和积极分子。在农村卫生组织建设工作中，几年来大力加强了县医院的建设，首先是各级党委加强了对县医院的领导，充实了党的领导骨干，加强了政治思想工作，提高了卫生人员的思想觉悟。并从技术人员、医疗装备、基本建设等方面予以充实，使县医院逐步成为全县卫生业务技术指导的中心和培养干部的基地，促进整个农村医疗水平迅速提高。目前，全国县医院的设备条件和业务技术水平已有很大提高，全国很多县医院能做一般腹部手术，部分公社医院已能做下腹部手术。全国已有60％以上的县医院和一部分公社医院办起了中级或初级卫生学校，并举办了各种短期训练班和业余学校，积极培养提高农村卫生人员。
    为了适应农村人民公社化和农业生产持续跃进的要求，不少地区，实行了集体保健医疗制度
  （即根据各地生产发展水平和群众自愿，社员看病的医药费，采取每年由社员交纳一定的“保健费”，并辅以公社的公益金补助，统一调剂使用的办法来解决）。目前，在山西、河南、山东、福建、湖南、上海、贵州、新疆等省、市、区的许多地区，已经相当广泛地实行了这一制度，受到了广大社员的热烈欢迎。社员们称赞道：“实行集体保健化，防病治病好办法，互助协作保健康，生产跃进劲头大。”
    以上各项工作的不断进展，也都直接而有力地推动了卫生运动的开展。几年来，以除四害、讲卫生，消灭主要疾病为中心的群众卫生运动有了很大的发展，特别是在今年春天党中央发出关于卫生工作的指示后，在全国农村，由于各级党委书记亲自挂帅，广泛发动群众，广大农村卫生人员进一步加强了技术指导，更掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众卫生运动的新高潮。在运动中，卫生先进地区迅速扩大，卫生先进单位不断增加，全国卫生红旗县——稷山开展卫生工作的先进经验也迅速地在各地推广，各省、市、自治区都出现了自己的“稷山”。稷山的人民在已取得光辉成绩的基础上，在“学太阳、赶太阳”的响亮口号下，继续学习卫生模范村——太阳村的经验，决心把红旗越举越高，向着新的更高的标准进军。在全党全民的一致努力下，农村的卫生面貌有了进一步的改善，四害显著减少了，加强了田间、工地生产第一线的卫生工作和劳动保护，公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的卫生工作获得显著改善；许多地区控制了季节性传染病的发生和流行，消灭寄生虫病和地方病的工作也加快了进度，有些地区还大规模地开展了防治慢性病的工作。以防治危害人民健康最严重的血吸虫病为例，几年来已治疗了五百余万病人，大部分病人都得到治愈，这就给生产战线输送了几百万劳动力。在防治地方病方面，陕西省在半年内治疗了六十一万病人，其中四十余万人已恢复健康，重返生产岗位。季节性传染病的发病率也在逐年下降，并出现了许多无传染病的地区和单位。
    农村卫生事业的迅速发展和大搞除害灭病卫生运动的结果，有效地保护了劳动力，提高了劳动出勤率和劳动效率，支援和促进了农业生产，也使广大农村的人民生活和精神面貌发生了巨大变化。过去曾经是人烟寥落、田园荒芜的疫区，现在到处洋溢着劳动的歌声，人人身体健壮，个个精神焕发，呈现出一片“田增产、人增寿、六畜兴旺”的繁荣欢乐景象。由于开展了群众性的预防保健工作，降低了发病率，增强了体质，提高了劳动出勤率和劳动效率。例如江西余江县消灭了血吸虫病以后，由每个劳动力经营二亩田提高到十亩以上，劳动效率提高到五倍左右。安徽省的界首县不仅消灭了危害当地人民最严重的黑热病、钩虫病、丝虫病、疟疾等几种寄生虫病，为农业生产战线输送了大批的劳动力，而且从1959年12月以来没有发生传染病的流行，有力地保障和促进了生产的持续跃进。全国卫生红旗稷山县更是生产卫生齐跃进的一个典范。全县消灭了九种多发病、地方病，劳动出勤率经常保持在98％以上，生产逐年上升。
    由于医疗卫生机构的发展、卫生医药人员思想觉悟的提高和集体保健医疗制度的推行，能够更好更及时地为广大农民群众解除疾病的痛苦，作到“无病早防，有病早治”。例如许多地区由于大力进行了以县医院为中心的农村医疗卫生组织建设，大大加强了卫生工作支援农业的前哨阵地，这不仅可以更好地支援农业生产，保护劳动力，而且对于建设社会主义新农村，改变农村文化科学技术面貌也有重要意义。在妇女儿童保健工作方面，许多地方由于妇女劳动保护做得好，产院、幼儿园、托儿所办得好，彻底解除了妇女参加生产的思想顾虑。例如河南登封县大冶人民公社的母子康福乐园建立一年半以来，共节约三万一千九百零五个劳动日，相当于增加一百一十多个整劳力投入了生产。开展除四害讲卫生运动，对人畜粪便、垃圾、污水也进行了无害化处理，既可以增积肥料，提高肥效，又可以清除蚊蝇孳生地，达到除害防病的目的，大大有利于生产。卫生工作搞好了，牲畜疾病大大减少了，出勤率高，繁殖快，膘肥体壮。这些事实充分说明了：卫生工作是促进生产的积极因素，是保证生产的重要措施。只要卫生工作坚持从发展生产出发，配合生产，为生产服务，开展卫生工作就一定能够更好地发展生产。
    为了更好发挥农村卫生工作促进农业生产的作用，响应党中央、毛主席大办农业、大办粮食的号召，在各行各业支援农业的热潮中，全国广大农村卫生医药人员都干劲更足地要求在过去已经取得成就的基础上，争取更大的成就。纷纷奔赴生产第一线，深入田间、工地和公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等集体生产生活单位，同广大社员一道，大除四害，大搞卫生，防治各种疾病，千方百计地保护劳动大军的健康，支援农业生产。据山东、四川、河南、贵州、江苏、青海、江西、湖北等省的不完全统计，战斗在生产第一线的各级卫生人员约有五十万人，作到了哪里的生产紧张，医药卫生人员就往哪里去支援，劳动大军到哪里，卫生人员就跟到哪里去。河北省石家庄市80％的卫生人员带着医药器械和生产工具，到“方田”安营扎寨，在田间组成了一个较健全的医疗卫生保健网，使社员小病小伤不出“方”，还在“方田”举办了卫生业余学校和卫生知识讲习班，就地培训和复训群众卫生骨干七万五千余名，近十五万名社员参加了卫生知识的学习。青海省西宁市把市内两个门诊部整套地搬到了农村，加强了生产前线的卫生医药力量。为了全面加强第一线的卫生工作，山西省的卫生部门提出了“‘四防’、‘五抓’保全勤，支援生产大跃进”的响亮口号，把第一线的卫生工作作得更加深入细致。所谓“四防”，就是防病、防伤、防暑、防毒，确保劳动大军的健康和安全，提高劳动出勤率和劳动效率。所谓“五抓”，就是抓五项措施：大抓卫生宣传教育，普及卫生知识；抓紧集体生产和生活中的卫生工作；抓好技术革新和技术革命；抓紧压青积肥和粪便、垃圾、污水的管理；抓劳逸安排。卫生人员深入生产第一线后，一般都能作到边防治疾病，边参加劳动，边宣传卫生知识，边培训群众卫生骨干，并坚持和社员群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量、同搞卫生，这样作的结果，不仅大大加强了生产第一线和以食堂为中心的集体生活“一条龙”的卫生工作，使卫生工作和生产生活结合得更紧密，有力地保证和促进了生产的发展，而且也大大密切了卫生人员和群众的关系，并使卫生人员在参加劳动生产和实际工作的过程中受到了锻炼，提高了思想觉悟。越来越多的卫生人员树立了热爱农村，热爱劳动，全心全意为农民服务的思想。他们决心红在农村，专在农村，在农村安家落户，把自己的全部精力和技术都贡献给建设农村人民公社的伟大事业。
    在卫生部门支援农业的运动中，各地城市医药卫生部门也广泛采用了挂钩协作、固定支援的形式，从人力、物力、传授技术、培养干部等多方面，大力支援了以县医院为中心的农村医疗卫生组织建设。辽宁省全省二百多个城市医院分别和四十一个县医院、四百六十个公社医院挂了钩，推行了“固定支援，一包到底，全面协作”的办法。江苏省采取了以一个市包一个专区或几个县，以市为主组织辅导协作组的办法，组织全省三十五个城市医院和五个部队医院分别与四十六个县医院和一部分公社医院建立了全面协作辅导关系，使被支援的县社医院的工作水平得到迅速、全面的提高。这种城乡卫生工作新的协作关系的建立，是党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社的必然产物，也是党中央和毛主席关于发展国民经济以农业为基础的思想日益深入人心的结果，它闪烁着我们伟大时代的光辉。
    我国农村卫生工作虽已取得了巨大成就，但是，这只不过是我们农村人民公社卫生工作的一个良好的开端。为了适应农业生产加速发展的要求，我们的农村卫生医药人员还要作长期的不懈的努力，并且，要在三年内作出显著成绩。我们全体农村卫生医药人员要很好完成摆在面前的这些新任务，必须更加深入地自觉地贯彻以农业为基础的方针，紧紧配合当前各地正在展开的以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动，进一步开展广泛的群众卫生运动，继续大力加强以县医院为中心的农村医疗卫生组织建设，广泛动员全体中西医药卫生人员，深入生产第一线，把医药卫生战线支援农业运动推向新的高潮。在当前的大好形势下，全体卫生人员必须再接再厉，坚决依靠党的领导，依靠群众，认真学习马克思列宁主义、特别是学习毛主席著作，继续加强思想改造，鼓足更大的干劲，为支援农业作出更大的贡献。
