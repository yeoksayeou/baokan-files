    A Day in Detroit
    By William Allen, USA
    The following recounts a reporter's observations while driving through the city of Detroit, population three million, on Tuesday, September 27, 1960.
    8:00 AM. We passed through the revolving doors of the gray and gloomy criminal court and entered Judge Gillis's courtroom. The courtroom, which can hold one hundred people, was packed with over two hundred waiting for arraignment.
    The indictments listed various crimes. Most of those awaiting trial were workers. The court clerk said that recently, cases of theft and robbery had been increasing endlessly, "because of unemployment." When you talk to the people in the prisoners' dock, the stories are the same: a large family, penniless, with nowhere to turn, "What else can we do?"
    We went into a building. The state's Fair Employment Practices Commission was handling a case in which black residents of the Rouge River area accused a bank of refusing to hire any black people, even though most of the bank's customers were black.
    Plaintiff: The Rouge River branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, present in court. Its spokesman, Smith, is an experienced trade unionist and auto worker. He said that for over a year, Rouge River residents had been picketing outside the bank, demanding that it hire a black person, but to no avail.
    Defendant: The bank, refused to appear in court. The bank manager expressed disdain for explaining why he was unwilling to hire even one black person. He would not appear without a subpoena.
    We went along the Detroit River to the east side, where the big industries are located. Now it is almost completely silent and desolate. As the car passed the factories, there were empty windows everywhere, and tens of thousands of workers had lost their jobs. The cause of the illness is automation, companies starting up in places where wages are lower and profits are higher, and a war economy that brings high prices to the people.
    Chrysler workers have suffered a new and heavy blow. Traditionally, workers would not receive layoff notices until several months after the new cars started rolling off the assembly line. This year, in the year of "prosperity" touted by Eisenhower, less than a few weeks after the 1961 Chrysler cars came off the assembly line, five thousand workers were laid off, and another five thousand are about to be laid off.
    Michigan has 300,000 unemployed, Detroit has 200,000, and this does not include the semi-unemployed workers who only work a few days a week.
    There are currently 825,000 unsold 1960 and 1961 cars. In the same period last year, there were only 595,000. A Chrysler worker told us, "The way it works now is that we have work if they sell cars. They take orders and then call us in to work. If there are no orders, we're out."
    The warm days are coming to an end. The biting wind blowing in from Lake St. Clair will soon bring sub-zero temperatures and knee-deep snow.
    Fifty-year-old Sheashell and his wife, Jenny, are facing the coming winter with dread. They and their seven children live in a dilapidated garage at 530 Navahoe Street. The other three children are lodging in the homes of other workers. They are luckier than Sheashell because they have jobs. But the garage can't accommodate the three of them.
    Sheashell and his wife and their seven children "live" in this dilapidated garage, blackened by stove smoke, and have nothing but the children and the garage. Sheashell lost his job when the company shut down. He was evicted from his home for owing $400 in rent. Now, the Detroit authorities are "mercifully" going to send him back to Birmingham, Alabama, where he was born, but where he doesn't even know anyone anymore.
    We passed Cobo Hall, a newly completed auditorium dedicated to gatherings of capitalists. The originally planned construction cost was $17 million, but soon the construction cost mysteriously rose to $54 million. Workers say that the hall is now worth $90 million.
    But for ten years, Detroit has not built a single affordable house for the million citizens living in the slums. The Detroit Department of Health believes that there are 25,000 homes in Detroit that are unfit for habitation, but people still live in them because they have nowhere else to move.
    We came to the Ford Motor Factory in the Rouge River area, once the largest automobile factory in the world. Henry Ford I, the automobile magnate and admirer of Hitler and Mussolini, once enslaved 84,000 auto workers here.
    We passed the historic Gate No. 4. In 1932, four workers, York, DeBlasio, Leny, and Bussel, were murdered here by Ford's henchmen. At the time, the four of them were leading a demonstration of 7,000 unemployed Ford auto workers, demanding jobs from Henry Ford.

    底特律的一日
    美国威廉·安兰
    这里记述的是一个记者于1960年9月27日（星期二）驱车游览拥有三百万人口的底特律城的见闻。
    上午八点钟。我们穿过了灰色阴暗的刑事法庭的旋转门，走进了吉里斯法官的法院。在容纳一百人的审判室里，挤满了等候提审的人，他们约有二百多名。
    起诉书指出他们所犯的罪是各色各样的。待审的人大都是工人。法院书吏说，最近，盗窃、抢劫的案件层出不穷，“这是因为失业的缘故”。当你同犯人栏内的人们谈起来，故事都是相同的：一大家人，一文莫名，无处求告，“有什么办法可想呢？”
    我们走进了一所楼房。州的就业问题公平处理委员会正在处理鲁格河区黑人控诉一家银行拒绝雇用任何黑人的案件，虽然这家银行的顾客大都是黑人。
    原告：全国有色人种协进会鲁格河区分会，在庭。它的发言人史密斯是一位有经验的工会运动者、汽车工人。他说一年多以来，鲁格河区市民一直在这家银行外面布置纠察队，要求它雇用一名黑人，始终没有成功。
    被告：银行，拒绝出庭。银行的经理表示不屑于出庭说明他为什么连一名黑人也不愿意雇用。不发出传票他是不肯出庭的。
    沿着底特律河来到了大工业所在的东区。现在这里几乎是一片沉寂荒凉。当汽车从工厂驶过的时候，到处是空空洞洞的窗子，好几万名工人失了业。病症的起因是自动化以及公司在工资较低利润较高的地方另起炉灶，还有给人民群众带来物价高涨的战争经济。
    克莱斯勒公司的工人遭受了新的沉重的打击。向例工人在新汽车开始出厂以后好几个月才会收到解雇通知。今年，在艾森豪威尔所吹嘘的“繁荣”的年头里，1961型克莱斯勒汽车出厂不到几个星期，五千名工人就被解雇，还有五千名即将解雇。
    密执安州有三十万名失业者，底特律有二十万名，而每周只有几天工作做的半失业工人还没有计算在内。
    滞销的1960型、1961型汽车，目前已达八十二万五千辆。去年同期只有五十九万五千。一个克莱斯勒的工人告诉我们说，“现在的程序是他们卖汽车我们就有活干。他们接受了订货就叫我们去上工。没有订货我们就得滚蛋。”
    暖和的日子快要过去了。从圣克雷湖上吹来的刺骨的寒风即将带来零下的温度和盖过膝头的大雪。
    五十岁的薛西尔与他的妻子珍妮怀着恐惧迎接即将到来的冬季。他们夫妇同七个孩子住在纳伐贺尔街五百三十号一个破旧不堪的汽车间里。另外的三个孩子寄宿在别的工人的家里。他们比薛西尔的运气好，因为他们有工作。但是汽车间容纳不下他们三个人。
    薛西尔夫妇和他们的七个孩子“生活”在这个被炉烟熏黑了的破旧的汽车间里，除了孩子和这个汽车间以外一无所有。薛西尔是在公司歇业的时候失掉工作的。他因为亏欠房租达四百美元，被逐出了住所。现在，底特律当局“仁慈地”要把他遣返他的出生地阿拉巴马州伯明翰，但是在那里他现在连一个熟人也没有。
    我们经过科博大厅，这是新近落成的专供资本家集会用的礼堂。最初计划的建造费用是一千七百万美元，不久，建造成本神秘地提高到五千四百万美元，工人们说，现在这个大厅值九千万美元。
    但是十年以来，底特律没有为居住在贫民窟的上百万的市民建造过一栋价格便宜的住宅。底特律卫生局认为底特律城有二万五千所房屋不适合居住，可是人们仍旧居住在这些房屋里，因为他们无处可迁。
    我们来到了昔日全世界最大的汽车工厂——鲁格河区的福特汽车工厂。福特汽车大王、希特勒和墨索里尼的钦慕者亨利福特一世，曾经在这里奴役过八万四千名汽车工人。
    我们经过了有历史意义的第四号门。1932年，四名工人约克、德布拉西奥、勒尼、布塞尔在这里被福特的特务凶手杀害。当时他们四个人正率领着七千名失业的福特汽车工人举行示威，向亨利福特要工作。
