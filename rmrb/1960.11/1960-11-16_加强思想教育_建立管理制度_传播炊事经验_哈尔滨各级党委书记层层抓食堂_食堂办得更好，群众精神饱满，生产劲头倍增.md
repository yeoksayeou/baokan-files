    Strengthening Ideological Education  Establishing Management Systems  Disseminating Cooking Experience
    Harbin's Party Committee Secretaries at All Levels Take Charge of Canteens
    Canteens办得更好，群众精神饱满，生产劲头倍增

    (Our report) The Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, led by the First Secretary, implemented the working method of grasping production with one hand and daily life with the other at all levels of Party organizations. They vigorously grasped the comprehensive organization and arrangement of the people's economic life, focusing on running the canteens well. This effectively promoted the improvement of canteens in factories, enterprises, government agencies, schools, and among residents in the streets, making the broad masses of workers and people eat well, sleep well, feel energetic and comfortable, greatly promoting production and work.

    With the development of production and the in-depth development of the comprehensive organization of the people's economic life, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly recognized the important role of grasping daily life in promoting production, and further realized that comprehensively organizing and arranging the people's economic life is an important issue related to realizing the sustained, comprehensive Great Leap Forward. Therefore, the Municipal Committee clearly pointed out that the greater the enthusiasm of the masses for production, the more the leading cadres at all levels should care about the people's lives. Party organizations at all levels must regard arranging the people's lives as a task as important as leading production, comprehensively arranging the people's clothing, food, housing, transportation, eating, wearing, burning, and using. At all times, it is necessary to grasp production with one hand and daily life with the other. Party organizations at all levels in the city conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Municipal Committee, and quickly launched a upsurge of comprehensively organizing and arranging the people's economic life with the focus on running the canteens well.

    The characteristics of Harbin's comprehensive organization of the people's economic life with the focus on running the canteens well are: Politics enters the canteens, and secretaries go down to the kitchens. From the First Secretary of the Municipal Committee to the leading cadres of Party organizations at all levels throughout the city, they take charge of canteens level by level. Comrade Ren Zhongyi, First Secretary of the Municipal Committee, personally presided over the city's canteen political work meeting, vigorously grasping the political and ideological work of the canteens, and led the secretaries of the Secretariat, members of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Committee, and other leading comrades to go deep into the canteens of factories, government agencies, enterprises, schools, streets, and other units to understand the situation, widely communicate with cooks, administrators, and service personnel, listen to their opinions, and put forward many specific suggestions for running the canteens well. After the canteen political work meeting, the First Secretaries and Secretaries of the People's Communes and factories, government agencies, enterprises, and schools in Daowai, Nangang, Daoli, Taiping, and Dongli, and other districts and counties put on the clothes of cooks and went into the canteens to cultivate "experimental plots," strengthen political and ideological work, eat, live, work, and discuss with the cooks, and study how to improve the canteen work, so that the workers and people eat well, eat economically, and eat tastefully, thereby greatly improving the canteen work.

    In the process of vigorously grasping the canteen work, the Municipal Committee also strengthened the leadership of the canteen work through organizational measures. At present, all units in the city have, in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Committee, on the one hand, transferred capable cadres to engage in canteen management, and on the other hand, fully mobilized the masses to participate in improving the canteen work, establishing "four accounts" (grain, grain coupons, purchase certificates, meal ticket revenue and expenditure accounts) and "four systems" (warehousing, rice allocation per person, grain final accounts, and dining system), establishing and improving the democratic management system, thereby greatly changing the appearance of the canteen management of many units, and establishing a new order in management work. In order to strengthen the leadership of the canteen work, the Party Committee of Harbin Boiler Factory decided that Deputy Secretary Yang Quan would concurrently serve as the Secretary of the Canteen General Branch, and established a Canteen Management Committee, with Deputy Directors Dong Zhongchi and Sun Tianchun concurrently serving as Director and Deputy Director. Middle-level cadres of the factory spend one day each week in the canteen, participating in labor. As a result of strengthening the canteen leadership, the variety of food increased greatly, and the quality also improved significantly, making the broad masses of workers energetic and greatly increasing their enthusiasm, and production rose. Since November 2nd, more than 1,000 workers in the factory have achieved "one top two" to "one top eight."

    In the process of vigorously grasping the canteen work, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also used the method of widely publicizing red flags and establishing pacesetters, so that the management experience and cooking skills of many advanced canteens quickly blossomed and bore fruit. The Municipal Committee and Party organizations at all levels have specifically held various forms of on-site meetings, widely introducing the experience of Harbin's Eight-District Grain Processing Factory, Northeast Agricultural College, Daowai People's Commune XinXing Branch, and other units in running the canteens well. The enthusiasm of all units in the city for learning from advanced experiences is extremely high, and people visit the advanced canteens every day to learn from their experiences in a continuous stream. While widely disseminating canteen experience, the Municipal Committee also gave full play to the role of professional departments. In order to help all units run the canteens well, the Harbin Municipal Service Bureau specially transferred more than 600 chefs from various state-owned and joint state-private restaurants, who went to the canteens of more than 80 units, including factories, government agencies, enterprises, schools, and streets, to widely impart cooking skills, fresh vegetable storage, cooking utensil innovation, and other experiences, adopting methods such as "delivering technology to the door and providing on-site guidance," making many advanced experiences quickly achieve practical results. With the help of professional chefs, the canteen of the Fourth Residential Committee of the Rolling Mill Branch transformed from a one-meal, one-dish meal to a diversified meal, which was greatly praised by the masses, and the number of diners also increased from more than 50 to about 200.

    加强思想教育  建立管理制度  传播炊事经验
    哈尔滨各级党委书记层层抓食堂
    食堂办得更好，群众精神饱满，生产劲头倍增
    本报讯　中共哈尔滨市委以第一书记挂帅，各级党组织层层贯彻一手抓生产、一手抓生活的工作方法，大抓以办好食堂为中心的全面组织和安排人民经济生活工作，有效地促进了各工厂、企业、机关、学校和广大街道居民食堂的改善，使广大职工群众吃得好、睡得好，精神旺盛，心情舒畅，大大地推动了生产和工作。
    随着生产的发展和全面组织人民经济生活工作的深入开展，中共哈尔滨市委清楚地认识到抓好生活对于促进生产的重要作用，并进一步体会到全面组织和安排人民经济生活，是关系到实现持续全面大跃进的一个重要问题。因此，市委明确地指出，群众的生产干劲越大，各级领导干部越要关心群众的生活。党的各级组织必须把安排人民生活视为和领导生产同样重要的任务，全面安排人民群众的衣、食、住、行和吃、穿、烧、用。任何时候都必须一手抓生产，一手抓生活。全市各级党组织认真贯彻市委的指示，迅速掀起了一个以办好食堂为中心的全面组织和安排人民经济生活的热潮。
    哈尔滨市以办好食堂为中心的全面组织人民经济生活的特点是，政治到食堂，书记下伙房。全市从市委第一书记开始到各级党组织领导干部，层层抓食堂。市委第一书记任仲夷同志亲自主持召开了全市的食堂政治工作会议，大抓食堂的政治思想工作，并率领书记处书记、市委常委等领导同志深入到工厂、机关、企业、学校、街道等单位的食堂了解情况，和炊事员、管理员、服务员广泛交谈，听取他们的意见，并对办好食堂提出许多具体的建议。食堂政治工作会议以后，全市道外、南岗、道里、太平、动力之乡等人民公社和各工厂、机关、企业、学校的党委第一书记和书记，纷纷穿起炊事人员的服装，深入到食堂中去种“试验田”，加强政治思想工作，和炊事人员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，研究如何改进食堂工作，使职工群众吃得好、吃得省、吃得有味道，从而使食堂工作大大改善。
    市委在大抓食堂工作中，还从组织措施上加强对食堂工作的领导。目前，全市各单位均根据市委的指示，一方面抽调了得力的干部从事食堂管理工作，一方面充分发动群众参与改进食堂工作，建立了“四账”（粮食、粮票、分购证、餐证收支账）和“四制度”（出入库、按人下米、粮食决算、就食制度），建立与健全了民主管理制度，从而使许多单位的食堂经营管理面貌大为改观，管理工作也建立了新秩序。哈尔滨锅炉厂党委为加强对食堂工作的领导，党委决定由副书记杨权兼任食堂总支书记，并成立了食堂管理委员会，由董仲池、孙田春副厂长兼正、副主任。全厂中层干部每周下食堂一天，参加劳动。由于加强食堂领导的结果，饭菜花样大为增多，质量也有了很大提高，使广大职工精神饱满，干劲猛增，生产上升。从11月2日以来，全厂有一千多名工人实现了“一顶二”到“一顶八”。
    中共哈尔滨市委在大抓食堂工作中，还运用了大插红旗，广树标兵的方法，使许多先进食堂的管理经验、炊事技术迅速开花结果。市委和各级党组织曾专门召开了各种形式的现场会议，广泛地介绍了哈尔滨八区粮食加工厂、东北农学院、道外人民公社新兴分社等单位办好食堂的经验。全市各单位学先进的劲头极为高涨，每天到先进食堂参观取经的人络绎不绝。市委在广泛传播食堂经验的同时，还充分发挥了专业部门的作用。哈尔滨市服务局为了帮助各单位办好食堂，专门从各国营、公私合营饭店抽调了六百多名厨师，分头深入到各工厂、机关、企业、学校、街道等八十多个单位的食堂，采取“技术送上门，临灶指导”等方法，广泛传授烹调技术、鲜菜贮藏、炊具革新等经验，使许多先进经验迅速收到了实效。轧钢分社第四居民委员会食堂在专业厨师的帮助下，由过去的一饭一菜变为饭菜多样化，大受群众赞扬，就食人员也由五十余人增加到二百人左右。
