　　Marx said in "Critique of the Gotha Program": "The early combination of productive labor and education is one of the most powerful means of transforming modern society." In "Instructions for the Delegates of the Provisional Central Committee on Several Questions," he also said: "Under a reasonable social system, every child from the age of nine should become a productive worker...not only laboring with the brain, but also laboring with the hands." Marx's ideal has been realized in New China. Under the guidance of the Party's education policy, in our primary school education, from the first step of children's education, we have combined education with productive labor. The Shenlufang Primary School in Xi'an, reported by this newspaper today, is a good example.

　　Primary school education is the foundation of national education and the beginning of cultivating communist successors. Therefore, how to start from primary school education, so that children develop the habit of laboring from an early age and laboring regularly, so that they grow up in an environment of both learning and laboring, is a very important issue. The Party branch of Shenlufang Primary School, through teachers, before and after students participate in labor; in the family, in the school, on campus, off campus; in labor, in the classroom, conduct labor education in a timely manner, so that children have a correct view of labor from an early age. With regular labor, the concept of labor increases day by day, and the foundation becomes deeper and deeper. As the saying goes: a tall building rises from the ground. To cultivate a new generation of communists, we must combine mental and physical labor from an early age.

　　In old China, education and labor were separated. Entering primary school for education can be said to be the beginning of breaking away from labor. Later, the more education one received, the deeper the degree of separation from labor. Until graduation from university, what was cultivated was a group of intellectuals who could not carry anything on their shoulders or lift anything with their hands, and who were full of contempt for labor and working people. Today, we have implemented the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor from primary schools, completely changing the past situation of theory being divorced from practice and teaching being divorced from production.

　　Xi'an Shenlufang Primary School often labors from the time children begin to receive education. The school formally includes labor in the teaching plan, cultivates children's love of labor and good habits of regular labor in teaching. In the process of labor, students' ideological quality and moral outlook have undergone fundamental changes, and communist ideas and styles are flourishing in children's young minds. Children are in the stage of growing physically and mentally. In order to take care of their age, physical strength, interests, and knowledge level, according to the situation of different grades, they can only be arranged for several tens of minutes of labor a day, gradually guiding them to participate in productive activities within their capacity from simple to complex. In such a short period of labor, how can we consolidate the view and habit of children's love of labor? How can we cultivate their fine qualities? This must be to make labor regular. Let the children unconsciously regard labor as the first need, as a pleasure, as a glorious and heroic undertaking. Let the children realize that labor is normal, and that not laboring is abnormal, so as to actively labor, love labor, and love working people.

　　Laboring from an early age and laboring regularly is a good way to combine primary school education and labor, and a good way to cultivate talents who use both hands and brains. This approach of Shenlufang Primary School is worthy of good learning by primary schools in various places.

    从小培养劳动习惯
    柏生
    马克思在《哥达纲领批判》中说：“生产劳动和教育的早期结合是改造现代社会的最强有力的手段之一”。在《给临时中央委员会代表的关于几个问题的指示》中又说：“在合理的社会制度下，每个儿童从九岁起都应当成为生产工作者。……不仅用脑来劳动，而且用手来劳动。”马克思的这个理想，在新中国已经实现了。在党的教育方针的指导下，我们在小学教育中，从儿童开始受教育的第一步起，就把教育和生产劳动结合起来了。今天本报报道的西安神鹿坊小学，就是很好的例证。
    小学教育是国民教育的基础，是培养共产主义接班人的开端。因此，如何从小学教育开始，使儿童培养成从小劳动，经常劳动的习惯，使他们在又学习又劳动的环境中成长，这是一个十分重要的问题。神鹿坊小学的党支部，通过教师，在学生参加劳动之前，参加劳动之后；在家庭里，在学校里，在校内，在校外；在劳动中，在课堂上，都及时进行劳动教育，使孩子们从小对劳动就有正确的看法。随着经常劳动，劳动观念与日俱增，根底越扎越深。俗语说：万丈高楼从地起，要培育共产主义的新的一代，从小就要把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来。
    在旧中国，教育和劳动是脱离的。进入小学受教育，可以说是脱离劳动的开始。以后，教育受得愈多，脱离劳动的程度也就愈深。直到大学毕业了，培养出来的是一批肩不能挑，手不能提，满脑子轻视劳动和轻视劳动人民的知识分子。今天，我们从小学里就贯彻了党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，彻底改变了过去理论脱离实践、教学脱离生产的状况。
    西安神鹿坊小学，从儿童开始受教育起，就经常劳动。学校把劳动正式列入教学计划中，在教学中培养儿童热爱劳动的观点，和经常劳动的良好习惯。在劳动过程中，学生的思想品质、道德面貌发生了根本的变化，共产主义的思想和风格，正在儿童幼小的心灵中蓬勃滋长。儿童正处在长身体长知识的阶段，为了照顾到他们的年龄、体力、兴趣、知识程度，根据不同年级的情况，每天只能给他们安排数十分钟的劳动，逐步引导他们由简到繁地参加力所能及的生产活动。在这样短时间的劳动过程中，怎样才能巩固地养成儿童热爱劳动的观点和习惯呢？怎样才能养成他们优良品质呢？这就必须是使劳动经常化。使孩子们在不知不觉中把劳动看成是第一需要，看成乐事，看成光荣、豪迈的事业。使孩子们认识到劳动是正常的，不劳动才是不正常的，从而主动地劳动，热爱劳动，热爱劳动人民。
    从小劳动，经常劳动，是小学教育和劳动相结合的很好的途径，是培养手脑并用的人材的好方法。神鹿坊小学这种做法，是值得各地小学很好学习的。
