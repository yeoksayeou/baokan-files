Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th -- A wave of opposition from the British people against the United States establishing a "Polaris" missile-equipped submarine base in Scotland is sweeping the nation.

Dan McGarvey, Chairman of the Boiler Makers Union, denounced on the 9th that the US plan to establish a nuclear submarine base in Britain was "wicked". He solemnly announced that boiler makers throughout Britain would refuse to repair US submarines carrying "Polaris" missiles or their depot ships, demonstrating the strong will of the British working class against the US "Polaris" missile base.

The Scottish Trades Union Congress Council issued a statement on the 9th, protesting the United States' establishment of a nuclear submarine base in Scotland. It called on trade union members to rise up and prevent the United States from establishing the base.

Residents leaders of Greenock are preparing to protest the US-UK agreement on "Polaris" missiles. Greenock is a Scottish industrial city with a population of 77,000, located across from Holy Loch where the US will establish the submarine base.

In Glasgow, the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament has demanded that the government abandon plans to allow the United States to establish a submarine base carrying "Polaris" missiles.

The Glasgow District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, representing 28,000 members, announced its opposition to the establishment of a US nuclear submarine base. The Blacksmiths' Association, based in Glasgow and with 11,000 members, the Glasgow District Co-operative Association with 300,000 members, and the Castlemilk Tenants' Association have also announced their opposition to the establishment of a US nuclear submarine base.

On the evening of the 7th, youths in Glasgow held aloft placards against "Polaris" missiles and marched in protest in front of the US Consulate in dense fog.

The Clydebank City Council, at a special meeting held on the 7th, fiercely opposed the establishment of a US nuclear submarine base in Holy Loch and demanded that the government cancel its agreement with the United States.

Amidst the nationwide outcry, a heated debate took place in the House of Commons on the 9th regarding the establishment of a US nuclear submarine base carrying "Polaris" missiles. Labour MP Emanuel Shinwell expressed unease about the establishment of such a base, asking Macmillan to tell the Americans that "it is unwise to establish a base among a hostile population". But Macmillan replied that this was "difficult to export".

In answering questions about the control of these "Polaris" missiles, Macmillan reiterated his earlier statement that the US government would not use these missiles without "the fullest possible consultation" with Britain, and that Britain was satisfied with this. He then hastily added that in an emergency, "it would obviously be impossible" to consult. At this point, someone shouted at him: "Shame!"

With the support of right-wing Labour leaders, the Conservative government, despite repeated requests from some backbench Labour MPs, refused to hold a debate on the issue of the US establishing a "Polaris" missile base in Britain.

    英国人民坚决反对美核潜艇基地
    锅炉工人将不替美核潜艇作修理工作
    格拉斯哥青年列队去美领事馆前示威
    据新华社伦敦10日电　英国人民反对美国在苏格兰建立装备“北极星”式导弹的潜水艇基地的浪潮席卷了全国。
    锅炉制造工人工会主席丹·麦加维9日指责说，美国在英国建立核潜艇基地的计划是“邪恶的”。他并且庄严地宣布，全英国的锅炉制造工人将不替美国携带“北极星”式导弹的潜艇或其仓库舰做修理工作。从而表明了英国工人阶级反对美国“北极星”式导弹基地的坚强意志。
    苏格兰职工大会理事会9日发表声明，抗议美国在苏格兰建立核潜艇基地。它号召工会会员们起来阻止美国建立基地。
    格林诺克的居民领袖正准备就美国和英国关于“北极星”式导弹的协议提出抗议。格林诺克是有七万七千居民的苏格兰工业城市，位于美国将建立潜艇基地的荷利湾对岸。
    在格拉斯哥，苏格兰争取裁减核军备委员会要求政府放弃准许美国设立携带“北极星”式导弹的潜艇基地的计划。
    代表二万八千名会员的混合机械工业工会格拉斯哥地区委员会宣布反对建立美国核潜艇基地。总部设在格拉斯哥的、拥有一万一千名会员的铁匠协会、有三十万会员的格拉斯哥地区合作社协会及卡斯耳米耳克房客协会也先后宣布反对建立美国核潜艇基地。
    格拉斯哥的青年们7日晚上高举反对“北极星”式导弹标语，冒着浓雾列队到美国领事馆前面示威。
    克莱德班克市议会在7日举行的特别会议上猛烈反对在荷利湾建立美国核潜艇基地，并且要求政府取消它同美国达成的协议。
    在举国的猛烈抗议声中，下院9日就建立携带“北极星”式导弹的美国核潜艇基地问题发生了剧烈的争吵。工党议员伊曼纽尔·辛威尔对建立这样的基地表示不安，他要求麦克米伦告诉美国人说：“在怀有敌意的居民中间建立基地是不明智的。”但是麦克米伦回答说，这是“难以出口的”。
    麦克米伦在回答关于这些“北极星”式导弹的控制权问题时重申了他早些时候的说法，他说，美国政府在没有同英国“进行最充分的协商之前”将不使用这些导弹，英国对此感到满意。他接着就急急忙忙补充说，在紧急的情况下，“显然不可能”进行协商。这时，有人向他大声喊道：“可耻！”
    保守党政府在工党右翼领袖的支持下，不顾工党的某些后座议员的再三要求，拒绝就美国在英国建立“北极星”式导弹基地的问题举行辩论。
