    Helping Teachers Improve Their Political and Ideological Level and Teaching Ability
    Northwest University Leaders Go Deep into the Front Lines of Teaching
    This Newspaper News Northwest University Party Committee Secretary and members go deep into the front lines of teaching, grasping teaching and scientific research on the one hand, and production labor and life on the other.

    Among the Party Committee Secretary, Standing Committee members, and members of this school, totaling sixteen people, in addition to the seven, including Standing Committee member Guo Shengwu, who are stationed long-term, the rest strive to spend at least three days a week, through兼职,兼课,听课 and on-site office work, going to teaching and research groups, classes, classrooms, laboratories, experimental farms, and factories to discover problems in a timely manner and solve them practically.

    After the Party Committee Secretary and members arrive at the front lines, they first consult teachers, students, and grassroots cadres. They learn a lot of knowledge from teachers, students, and grassroots cadres through methods such as attending classes, having conversations, and consulting teachers, so as to quickly familiarize themselves with specific work. After Party Committee Standing Committee member Xiao Keping was stationed long-term in the Mathematics Department, he often went to the classroom to attend classes, read mathematics books, and attend mathematics academic report meetings, asking teachers to explain some basic mathematical principles. When he started reading the book "Mathematical Analysis," he didn't understand many nouns and terms, so he asked professors, teaching assistants, and even students for help again and again. When there was no one around who could answer his questions, he adopted the method of linking the context and meticulously studying and pondering the general meaning. Often, when the night was quiet, he was still studying hard under the lamp. In this way, in the two years he was stationed, he has learned sixteen basic theory courses and professional courses such as "Differential Geometry." After Xiao Keping read "Mathematical Analysis," he realized that this course did not make good use of the viewpoint of dialectical materialism to analyze the principle of limits, so he immediately explained to the teachers the importance of implementing dialectical materialism in the mathematics course, inspiring teachers to pay attention to overcoming the shortcomings in the course in a timely manner.

    After the Party Committee Secretary and members went deep into the front lines, they all tried their best to be good consultants for grassroots cadres, helping them improve their political and ideological level and professional ability, and summarizing various advanced experiences. Party Committee Secretary Wu Dayu went to the Chinese Department to help teachers and students clarify their thinking, formulate plans, and concentrate their efforts on writing books such as "Research on Mao Zedong's Literary and Artistic Thought," "A History of Literature in the Ten Years Since the Founding of the Country," and "The Story of Zhang Qiuxiang." The entire school has compiled various important advanced experiences into forty-seven special reports.

    The Party Committee Secretary and members, in the front lines of teaching, pay special attention to taking the lead in setting an example, using exemplary actions to motivate the masses. For example, according to the requirements of teaching, the "Dynamic Geology" course should add content on ancient glaciers, but some teachers in the General Geology Teaching and Research Group believed that there was little information in this area and could not be discussed much. After Party Committee member and Vice President Zhang Bosheng, who established regular contact with this teaching and research group, learned of this situation, he personally led the director of the General Geology Teaching and Research Group, Associate Professor Zhang Yaolin, and some students to conduct a two-month field survey in the Qinling Mountains in conjunction with scientific research. As a result, they collected a lot of information about ancient glaciers in China. After returning to the school, they also collaborated with the teachers of the General Geology Teaching and Research Group to sort out, summarize, and improve the content, enriching the content of the "Dynamic Geology" course. In addition, the Party Committee Secretary and some members also personally participated in the teaching of political theory courses. In order to unremittingly go deep into the front lines of teaching, the Party Committee has adopted many effective measures. For example, the "three-two-one" system has recently been implemented (that is, three days a week are spent going deep into the grassroots, two days are spent in meetings and handling general work, and one day is spent studying), ensuring that the Party Committee Secretary and members have more time to go to the front lines.

    帮助教师提高政治思想水平和教学能力
    西北大学领导干部深入教学第一线
    本报讯　西北大学党委书记和委员深入教学第一线，一手抓教学、科学研究；一手抓生产劳动、生活。
    这个学校党委书记，常委和委员共十六名。他们中除了常委郭绳武等七人长期蹲点外，其余的都争取每周至少有三天的时间，通过兼职、兼课、听课和现场办公等方式，到教研组、班级、课堂、实验室、试验农场和工厂去，及时发现问题，切实加以解决。
    党委书记和委员到了第一线后，先向教师、学生、基层干部请教。他们通过听课、交谈、请师等方法，从教师、学生、基层干部那里，学到了许多知识，尽快地熟悉具体业务。党委常委萧克平到数学系长期蹲点后，就经常到课堂听课，阅读数学书籍，参加数学学术报告会，请教师讲解一些基本的数学原理。他开始读“数学分析”一书时，好多名词术语弄不懂，他就一遍又一遍地向教授、助教、甚至学生请教。身边无人可以为他解答时，他就采取联系上下文苦琢细磨的办法揣摩大意。常常是当夜深人静的时候，他还在灯下苦读。就这样，他在蹲点的两年中，已学了“微分几何”等十六门基础理论课和专业课。萧克平读了“数学分析”，发觉这门课程没有很好地运用辩证唯物论的观点来分析极限的原理，就立刻向教师说明数学课程要贯彻辩证唯物论的重要性。启发教师注意及时克服课程中的缺点。
    党委书记和委员深入第一线后，都竭力当好基层干部的参谋，帮助他们提高政治思想水平和业务能力，总结各种先进经验。党委书记吴大羽到中文系，帮助师生明确思想，制定计划，集中力量编写“关于毛泽东文艺思想的研究”、“建国十年文学史”和“张秋香的故事”等书。全校已把各种重要的先进经验编写成四十七篇专题报告。
    党委书记和委员在教学第一线，特别注意带头作出样子，用模范行动来带动群众。例如，按照教学的要求，“动力地质学”课程要增加古冰川的内容，但普通地质教研组一些教师却认为这方面的资料少，不能多讲。与这个教研组建立经常联系的党委委员、副校长张伯声知道这种情况后，亲自率领普通地质教研组主任、副教授张耀麟和部分学生，结合科学研究，到秦岭进行为期两个多月的野外调查。结果，搜集到许多有关中国古冰川的资料。返校后又协同普通地质教研组的教师进行整理，加以总结提高，丰富了“动力地质学”课程的内容。此外，党委书记和部分委员还亲自参加政治理论课的教学。为了坚持不懈地深入教学第一线，党委会采取了许多有效措施。如最近推行了“三二一”制（即每周有三天的时间深入基层，两天的时间开会和处理一般工作，一天的时间学习），保证了党委书记和委员有更多的时间到第一线去。
