Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 26th: Shuangyashan Coal Mine employees have raised the red flag of high production and increased transportation. The average daily output in late October increased by more than 2,000 tons compared to mid-October, and the average daily production level in the first and middle ten days of November increased by more than 11% compared to October; the daily transportation volume of coking coal leaped from more than 300 train cars before late October to more than 450 train cars. In the past 20 days or so, the average daily amount of coal transported out has exceeded the plan by more than 50 train cars. The tunneling footage in the first and middle ten days of November for the entire mine also increased by 11.8% compared to October.

Under the leadership of the Shuangyashan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shuangyashan Coal Mine conscientiously implemented the policy of "high coal production, tunneling first." The entire mine is now preparing nearly 300 tunneling work faces, far exceeding the total number of existing coal mining work faces, laying a solid foundation for achieving sustained high production. As early as the first half of this year, the Shuangyashan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China made arrangements for the tunneling work in the new and old mining areas of the entire mine. The newly built Baoshan Mine and Sifangtai Mine had fewer work faces, so they adopted the strategy of maintaining the existing production level, strengthening tunneling, and striving to add more work faces; the old mines had a certain number of work faces, so they advanced both mining and tunneling. In this way, the old mines maintained a sustained high production level, and the capacity of the new mines also rapidly improved. In the past six months, the Baoshan Mine has increased its coal mining work faces by eight, and its daily production level has risen from more than 600 tons in the first half of the year to more than 2,100 tons. The coal mine has continuously strengthened its leadership over tunneling work and replenished tunneling strength. From the mining bureau and various mines to each wellhead, there are now Party secretaries, general branch secretaries, mine directors, well directors, chief engineers, heads of mechanical and electrical departments, and technicians who are specifically responsible for leading tunneling work at every level. Since entering the fourth quarter, each mine has transferred more than 1,000 people from auxiliary departments to replenish the tunneling teams, ensuring that the tunneling front line is strong. As a result, in the first 20 days of November alone, the entire mine opened 25 new tunneling work faces.

95% of the coking coal from this coal mine is transferred out to support steel industry production. In order to transport the coking coal out in a timely manner, create conditions for the coal mine to achieve sustained high production, and provide fuel for key steel enterprises to increase production in a timely manner, the Shuangyashan Railway Station and the coal mine transportation departments jointly established a Party committee to strengthen railway-mine cooperation. Now, the railway side promptly informs the coal mine of how many train cars can be supplied, which trains, and when they will enter the mining area; the coal mine also informs the railway of the internal transportation, coal storage, production, and loading conditions, which greatly enhanced transportation potential. Currently, the 13 railway transportation lines in the entire mining area are playing the role of 17 lines. Since breaking through the original level of more than 300 train cars loaded per day in late October, the average daily loading volume of the entire mine has remained at more than 450 train cars. The Lingdong Mine, which produces about 7,000 tons of coal per day, has continuously transported out every ton of coal produced for more than 20 days without any coal landing, directly loading the coal onto trains. This has greatly promoted the sustained high production of the coal mine. In the high tide of the coal high production and increased transportation campaign, the Shuangyashan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Party committees at all levels of the coal mine, while strengthening the political and ideological work of the employees, are very concerned about the lives of the masses. Thanks to good prior arrangements, the city's employees have now prepared enough vegetables for the winter. Leading cadres such as Pei Youxin, Deputy Director of the Mining Bureau, and Miao Chunqing, Director of the Municipal Finance and Trade Department, also personally went to Lingdong No. 6 Well and Lingxi Shaft to wash vegetables, wash rice, and make bread dumplings together with the canteen chefs, and jointly studied how to improve the lives of employees. Party secretaries of various mines, general branch secretaries of wellheads, well directors, etc., also went to the canteens to help improve canteen management. The concern of leading cadres for the lives of the masses has further encouraged the employees to achieve sustained high production. (Attached picture)

In the past 20 days or so, the average daily amount of coal transported out has exceeded the plan by more than 50 train cars, powerfully supporting steel production.

    抓紧掘进工作　加强路矿协作　安排职工生活
    双鸭山煤矿高产多运支援钢铁生产
    据新华社哈尔滨26日电　双鸭山煤矿职工举起了高产多运的红旗。10月下旬平均日产量比中旬增长两千多吨，11月上中两旬平均日产水平又比10月份提高11％强；焦煤日运量从10月下旬以前的三百多车跃进到四百五十多车，最近二十多天平均每天外运煤量都超过计划五十多车。全矿11月份上中两旬掘进进尺也比10月份提高11.8％。
    在中共双鸭山市委的领导下，双鸭山煤矿认真贯彻了“煤炭高产，掘进先行”的方针。现在全矿已准备下近三百个掘进工作面，大大超过现有采煤工作面的总数，为实现持续高产打下了牢固基础。早在今年上半年，中共双鸭山市委就对全矿新矿区、老矿区的掘进工作分别作了安排。新建的宝山矿和四方台矿工作面少，就采取保持现有生产水平，加强掘进，力争多增加工作面；老矿井有一定数量的工作面，就采掘并进。这样，老矿保持了持续高产的水平，新矿的能力也迅速提高。半年来，宝山矿采煤工作面增加了八个，日产水平由上半年六百多吨上升到二千一百多吨。煤矿不断加强了对掘进工作的领导，充实了掘进力量。从矿务局、各矿到各个井口，现在层层都有专职领导掘进工作的党委书记、总支书记、矿长、井长，和总工程师、机电科长、技术员。进入四季度以来，各矿又从辅助部门调出一千多人充实掘进队伍，保证了掘进第一线兵强马壮。这样一来，仅11月份的前二十天，全矿就增开了二十五个新的掘进工作面。
    这个煤矿95％的焦煤都外调支援钢铁工业生产。为了及时地把焦煤运出去，给煤矿持续高产创造条件，及时为重点钢铁企业增产提供燃料，双鸭山铁路车站和煤矿运输部门联合成立了党委会，加强了路矿协作。现在，铁路方面提前把能供多少车皮、是哪几次车、什么时候进入矿区，及时告诉煤矿；煤矿也把矿内捣运、贮煤、生产和装车等情况，告诉铁路，这样就大大发挥了运输潜力。现在，全矿区十三条铁路运输线路已在发挥着相当于十七条线路的作用。从10月下旬突破原来日装三百多车的水平以来，全矿平均日装车量一直保持在四百五十多车的水平上。日产煤七千吨左右的岭东矿，已经连续二十多天产的煤一吨也不落地，直接装车运走。这就大大促进了煤矿的持续高产。在煤炭高产多运的竞赛高潮中，中共双鸭山市委和煤矿各级党委在加强对职工的政治思想工作的同时，十分关心群众的生活。由于事先安排得好，现在全市职工已备足过冬的蔬菜。矿务局副局长裴有新、市委财贸部长苗春青等领导干部，还亲自深入到岭东六井和岭西竖井，同食堂老师傅一起洗菜、淘米、合面包饺子，共同研究改善职工生活。各矿党委书记和井口总支书记、井长等，也纷纷下食堂，帮助改进食堂管理。领导干部关心群众生活，就更加鼓舞了职工们实现持续高产的干劲。（附图片）
