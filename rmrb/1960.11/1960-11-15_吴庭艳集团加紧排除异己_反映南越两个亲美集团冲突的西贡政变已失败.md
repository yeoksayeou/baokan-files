　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 14th: Saigon News: Following the failure of the Saigon coup on November 11th, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is plotting to suppress those who participated in the coup and is intensifying internal purges.

　　According to reports, after Ngo Dinh Diem's troops regained control of Saigon on November 12th, Ngo Dinh Diem delivered a speech via radio, claiming that he would "punish according to law" those who wanted to overthrow his rule.

　　Based on Ngo Dinh Diem's intentions, Ngo Dinh Diem's "National Assembly" passed a resolution at a special meeting held on the evening of the 12th, requesting the government to "punish according to law" those who staged the coup. Ngo Dinh Diem also instructed some senior military officers to write recommendations demanding the dismissal of Phan Khac Suu (a representative of Ngo Dinh Diem's National Assembly) and to punish him in accordance with Ordinance No. 10 of 1959. This law stipulates that those who oppose the Ngo Dinh Diem clique or even just suspected of opposition can be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.

　　In addition, on the 12th, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique organized some hooligans to hold demonstrations, condoning them to smash newspaper offices such as "Morning Bell" and "New Saigon News," on the pretext that these newspapers published the communiqués of the "Revolutionary Committee" that staged the coup.

　　At the same time, Ngo Dinh Diem is carrying out large-scale purges within his ruling group, especially in the army. Ngo Dinh Diem's intelligence agencies are suppressing and persecuting those who oppose Ngo Dinh Diem.

　　These brutal actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are a manifestation of greater panic and madness as they approach their demise. This Saigon coup was merely a conflict between two pro-American groups in South Vietnam, but the precariousness of the US-Ngo clique's rule exposed by it has a profound social background.

　　In the six years since the Vietnam armistice, the US-Ngo clique has turned South Vietnam into a living hell. Ngo Dinh Diem's family monopolized political, military, and economic power, forming the "Ngo Dynasty." Due to the infiltration of American capital, the flooding of American surplus goods, and the Ngo Dinh Diem family's cruel exploitation, the economy of South Vietnam is increasingly bankrupt, and the people's lives are miserable. Currently, two-thirds of South Vietnam's textile machines, more than 10,000 sugar mills, and hundreds of woodworking factories have been forced to close down. The number of unemployed people nationwide has reached more than 1.5 million, with the unemployed in Saigon accounting for 68.6% of the city's population. The wages of working people are decreasing year by year, and will be reduced by another 5% this year, while prices continue to rise. At the same time, exorbitant taxes and levies are increasing daily, with land tax alone increasing by 25% in the first half of this year. Tax revenue in the 1961 budget will be four times higher than in 1953.

　　Not only that, but the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has also been stepping up military expansion and war preparations in accordance with American plans, stubbornly refusing to peacefully reunify Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords, and attempting to build South Vietnam into an American base of aggression and a colony. Currently, South Vietnam's military expenditure accounts for 49% of the total budget, while expenditure on economic aspects only accounts for 2% this year. The number of various military personnel has reached more than 450,000.

　　The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's reactionary and dark rule has been resisted by the broad masses of the people, and the struggles of the people in various places have risen one after another. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique implements cruel "sweeps" against the people and the "three all" policy of burning all, killing all, and looting all, establishing concentration camps such as so-called "land reclamation zones" and "densely populated areas," using mobile guillotines and head-chopping machines to kill the people, and constantly formulating various fascist laws to strengthen its fascist rule in South Vietnam.

　　Faced with the people's increasingly high anti-resistance struggles, economic bankruptcy, and increasing political instability, even more and more people within the ruling class are expressing dissatisfaction with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique is increasingly isolated, and their internal contradictions are becoming increasingly apparent. In order to eliminate dissidents, Ngo Dinh Diem has recently launched a large-scale purge of officials he considers to be not "loyal." According to incomplete statistics, from June this year to now, in less than half a year, more than 300 people have been purged.

　　According to the British "Reynolds News," the situation in Saigon after the failure of the coup is one of "unstable calm," and "there is evidence that the people have been resisting the oppressive regime of the pro-Western President Ngo Dinh Diem."

### 吴庭艳集团加紧排除异己  反映南越两个亲美集团冲突的西贡政变已失败

    吴庭艳集团加紧排除异己
    反映南越两个亲美集团冲突的西贡政变已失败
    新华社河内14日电　西贡消息：在11月11日的西贡政变失败以后，吴庭艳集团正在谋划镇压参加政变的人，并在加紧进行内部清洗。
    据报道，11月12日当吴庭艳集团的军队重新控制西贡后，吴庭艳通过电台发表讲话，声称将要“依法惩治”那些想推翻他的统治的人。
    吴庭艳的“国会”根据吴庭艳的意旨，在12日晚上举行的特别会议上通过决议，要求政府“依法惩治”举行政变的人。吴庭艳还指使一些高级军官写建议书要求开除参加政变的潘克丑（吴庭艳的国会代表）的职务，并根据1959年第十号法令加以惩治。这项法律规定，可以对那些反对吴庭艳集团或者那怕只要有反对嫌疑的人处以极刑或无期徒刑。
    此外，吴庭艳集团还在12日组织了一些流氓举行游行示威，纵容他们捣毁“晨钟报”、“新西贡报”等报馆，借口是这些报纸发表了举行政变的“革命委员会”的公报。
    与此同时，吴庭艳正在其统治集团的内部，特别是在军队中，进行大规模的清洗。吴庭艳的特务机构正在对同吴庭艳作对的人进行镇压和迫害。
    吴庭艳集团的这些残暴行动是一种因临近死亡而更加惊慌和疯狂的表现。这次西贡政变只是南越两个亲美集团之间的冲突，但是由此而暴露出来的美吴集团统治的摇摇欲坠，却有着深刻的社会背景。
    越南停战的六年来，美吴集团已经把越南南方变成了一座人间地狱。吴庭艳的家族垄断了政治、军事和经济各方面的权柄，形成了“吴氏王朝”。由于美国资本的渗入，美国剩余货物的泛滥，以及吴庭艳家族的残酷搜刮，越南南方经济日益破产，人民生活困苦不堪。目前，越南南方有三分之二的纺织机、一万多所糖坊和成百家木器厂已经被迫停业，全国失业人数达到一百五十多万，西贡的失业者占全市人口的68.6％。劳动人民的工资逐年减少，今年将又降低5％，而物价不断上涨。同时，苛捐杂税与日俱增，仅今年上半年土地税就提高了25％。1961年预算中的税收将比1953年增加四倍。
    不但如此，吴庭艳集团还一直在按照美国的计划加紧扩军备战，顽固拒绝按照日内瓦协议和平统一越南，企图把越南南方建成为美国的侵略基地和殖民地。目前南越的军事开支占总预算的49％，而用于经济方面的开支今年只占2％。各种军事人员已达四十五万多人。
    吴庭艳集团的反动黑暗统治遭到广大人民群众的反抗，各地人民群众的斗争此伏彼起。吴庭艳集团对人民实行残酷的“扫荡”和烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光”政策，建立所谓“垦荒区”、“稠密区”等集中营，使用流动断头台、铡头机等杀害人民，不断制订各种法西斯法令，借以加强其在越南南方的法西斯统治。
    面临人民群众的日益高涨的反抗斗争以及经济破产和政治上的日益不稳定，以致连统治阶级内部也有愈来愈多的人对吴庭艳集团表示不满。吴庭艳集团日益孤立，他们的内部矛盾日益明显化，吴庭艳为了排除异己，近来对他认为不“忠诚”的官员展开了大规模的清洗。据不完全统计，从今年6月到现在不到半年的时间，已经有三百多人被清洗。
    据英国的“雷诺新闻”报道，政变失败以后的西贡局面是一种“不稳定的平静”，“有证据证明，人民一直在抵抗亲西方的吴庭艳总统的压迫人民的政权。”
