    Revolutionary Shed
    After breakfast, the county committee members, each carrying luggage, went to the countryside to immerse themselves in the front lines of production. I, along with Comrade Lu Huoneng, the director of the county committee office, and several other comrades, took our bedding, office supplies, telephone... and headed towards Wugang Slope in Xincun Brigade, Changlin Commune. Wugang Slope, with its poor soil and barren fields, is one of the county's low-yield slopes. Along the way, I pondered how to transform these low-yield fields. According to the land survey results, every commune and every brigade in the county had low-yield slopes of varying sizes. Lost in thought as I walked, I unknowingly crossed the railway. Ahead, a flat expanse of slope, covered in green red clover, was the famous low-yield slope – Wugang Slope. In the middle of the slope, four or five people were gathered, and as we approached, we recognized them as Comrade Xu Sanle, the Party branch secretary of Xincun Brigade, and several commune members discussing something. When he recognized us, he ran over. It turned out they were studying the soil. Upon hearing this, I said excitedly, "That's great! That's why I've come here too."
    I bent down and grabbed a handful of soil, placing it in my palm. The soil was white, almost like refractory clay. When squeezed, it formed a round lump. When thrown forcefully, it landed on the ground with a dull thud. This was truly the notorious "white sand slope with knotty fields," no wonder nothing grew there.
    In the evening, Comrade Zhang Shouyu, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, arrived and convened a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians in Xincun Brigade to discuss measures for transforming Wugang Slope. Many people spoke at the meeting, some in favor, some against, but we carefully considered every opinion. At that time, someone brought up the successful transformation of the Tiger Ridge and Ancient Tower Ridge low-yield slopes last year, which provided great inspiration. The key to their bumper harvests and the transformation of their low-yield appearance lay in the leading cadres immersing themselves in reality, "sitting" on the low-yield slopes, advocating the "ten upslope" experience of living, eating, working, holding office, holding meetings, telephoning... Camping on the low-yield slopes not only allowed for the timely discovery and resolution of problems but also greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of the commune members. This was a great revolution in leadership methods.
    Everyone was delighted to hear that the county committee comrades were going to camp on Wugang Slope, saying, "We guarantee to make Wugang Slope a success!"
    The next day, we started building a thatched shed. The masses automatically came to help, some carrying timber, some going to distant mountains to cut reeds and thatch, some working at night to level the foundation. Many women brought food and helped weave thatch curtains and twist ropes. In a few days, a small thatched shed was built, containing beds, desks, a telephone, and our production tools. At the entrance hung a large wooden sign with white characters on a red background: "Joint Command Headquarters of the Dongxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Changlin Commune Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for Transforming Low-Yield Fields." On the night the thatched shed was built, we held our first meeting there. The howling north wind shook the newly built shed violently, and the kerosene lamp on the table was blown out several times. The feet of those attending the meeting were numb with cold. At that moment, some individuals suggested: "The thatched shed is formalism, it is detachment from the masses." As soon as this opinion was put forward, someone retorted: "Living in a thatched shed is our down-to-earth work style of going deep into the fields, it is a concrete manifestation of close ties with the masses." Everyone refuted the opposition with facts. The meeting decided that cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians would combine their efforts to create joint experimental fields. Everyone immediately found their partners, and the fields were also determined. Old farmer Hu Longle, Party branch secretary Xu Sanle, and I selected a piece of land measuring 1.5 mu to the left of the thatched shed as our experimental field.
    Everyone put up their signs, and the experimental and comprehensive transformation activities began. From then on, we ate in the thatched shed, slept in the thatched shed, held meetings in the thatched shed. The thatched shed became our base of life and the center of the county's low-yield field transformation activities. County committee meetings and commune party committee secretary meetings were also frequently held here, naturally forming a veritable command headquarters for the transformation of low-yield fields, a scientific research institute, a treasure-sharing station, a red and expert university, a battle camp for cadres and commune members, and a good place to talk heart-to-heart with commune members and tell stories.
    Such thatched sheds existed not only on Wugang Slope, but every county committee member and commune party committee member built such a shed on the low-yield slopes, totaling more than ninety. Wherever there was a low-yield slope, there cadres built such a thatched shed. Wherever there were thatched sheds, the crops grew particularly well this year. The masses gave it a very good name: "Revolutionary Shed."

    革命棚
    吃过早饭，县委委员都背着行李，分头下乡深入生产第一线，我和县委办公室主任鲁活能等几位同志，带着铺盖和办公用具、电话机……朝长林公社新村大队的乌岗坂走去。乌岗坂土质差田底瘦，是我们县的低产坂之一。一路上，脑子里考虑着怎样改造低产田的问题。根据土地普查结果，全县每个公社、每个大队都有面积大小不同的低产坂。边走边想，不觉横过铁路，前面平坦坦的一片大坂，绿茵茵的红花草，就是著名的低产坂——乌岗坂。坂中间有四五个人围在那里，当我们走近时，才认出是新村大队的党支部书记徐三仂同志带着几个社员在那里谈论什么。当他认出我们时，就跑了过来。原来他们在研究土壤。我一听非常高兴地说：“那好呀！我也是到这儿来的。”
    我弯腰抓了一把泥土放在掌心上，那土是白色的，就和耐性粘土差不多，用手一捏，便成了个圆糰，用力一抛，落在地下突突响。这真是名不虚传的“白沙坂结田”，难怪它不长庄稼。
    晚上，公社党委第一书记张守愚同志来了，就在新村大队召开了党、团员、干部、老农、技术员座谈会，讨论对乌岗坂进行改造的措施。会上发言的人很多，有正面的，也有反面的，但不管什么意见，我们都仔细地琢磨着。这时有人把去年改造老虎岗、古楼岗这两个低产坂的事提出来了，给大家很大的启示。这两个低产坂所以在去年能取得丰收，改变了低产面貌，其关键就在于领导干部深入实际，屁股坐在低产坂，提倡住、吃、劳动、办公、开会、电话……十上坂的经验；在低产坂安营扎寨，不仅能及时发现和解决问题，而且可以大大地激发社员的生产积极性，这是领导方法的大革命。
    大家听到县委的同志要在乌岗坂安营扎寨，都很高兴，说：“我们保证把乌岗坂搞好！”
    第二天，我们就动手搭茅棚，群众都自动跑来，有的扛来木料，有的到很远的山上去砍茅竹、茅草，有的打夜工平地基。很多妇女带饭来吃，帮助编茅草帘、搓绳。几天工夫，一幢小小的茅棚搭起来了，里面摆有床铺、办公桌、电话机和我们的生产工具。门口还挂着“中共东乡县委员会、中共长林公社委员会改造低产田联合指挥部”的白底红字大木牌。茅棚搭起来的那天晚上，我们就在这里召开了第一次会议。吼叫的北风把刚搭起来的茅棚吹得直晃动，桌上的煤油灯几次被吹熄，开会的人脚都冻麻木了。就在这时，有个别人提出：“茅棚是形式主义，是脱离群众。”这个意见一提出，就有人反驳说：“住茅棚是我们深入田间踏踏实实的工作作风，是密切联系群众的具体表现。”大家用事实一一驳倒了反对派。会上议定干部、老农、技术员三结合搞联合试验田，当场大家都找好了对象，田也确定了。我和老农胡龙仂、党支部书记徐三仂靠茅棚左边选择了一块一亩五分的地做试验田。
    大家把牌子插上了，试验和全面改造活动开始了。从此，吃在茅棚，睡在茅棚，开会在茅棚，茅棚变成了我们生活的基地，也成了全县改造低产田活动的中心。县委会议、公社党委书记会议也经常到这里开，自自然然地形成了名符其实的改造低产田指挥部、科学研究所、传经取宝站、红专大学、干部社员战斗营房，以及和社员谈心讲故事的好场所。
    像我们这样的茅棚，不止乌岗坂一个，每个县委委员和公社党委委员都在低产坂上搭有这样的茅棚，大大小小共有九十多个。那里有低产坂，那里就有干部搭起这种茅棚。凡是有茅棚的地方，今年禾就特别长得好。群众给它取了个很好的名字：“革命棚”。
