Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. Recently, the Party committees at all levels in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, conducted a check and comparison of the ideological style and work situation of county, commune, and brigade-level cadres who are deeply involved in the front lines of agricultural production. This time, a large number of good cadres who love agriculture and adhere to the "Four Togethers" were commended, and work experiences were exchanged, which played a positive role in further improving the work style and methods of cadres, strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses, and promoting current production.

Since April this year, Shuyang County has successively selected and dispatched 5,600 county, commune, and brigade-level cadres to settle down in production teams and work groups, serving as deputy party branch secretaries, deputy team leaders, cooks, etc., participating in and leading production. The comparison campaign, which began in mid-October, focused on conducting "Five Checks and Five Comparisons": Check ideology, compare love for agriculture; check work style, compare adherence to the Four Togethers; check work, compare the combination of key points and overall situation; check labor, compare actual work points; check learning, compare implementation of policies. The comparison method involved starting with checking and summarizing work, self-reporting and public discussion, affirming achievements and criticizing shortcomings. Then, the results were posted publicly to solicit opinions from team cadres and the masses, and evaluations were made. Good cadres recognized by the masses, whose deeds were outstanding, were reported to the county party committee for approval and established as county-wide model cadres. A total of 2,253 good cadres and 128 advanced units were selected throughout the county, and 250 cadres were named county-wide models.

Through the comparison, cadres who were commended worked even harder; cadres who were criticized corrected their shortcomings as soon as possible and quickly emulated the models. Huang Yiquan, the party branch secretary of Liuchang Brigade in Taiping Commune, became more pragmatic, more enthusiastic, and more humble after being named a model. He went to Siyang Farm to "learn from experience" from Zhang Xuetong, the farm director and a model for grassroots cadres in the county. After returning, he held a branch meeting to "pass on the experience." By discussing Zhang Xuetong's strengths, it was found that some comrades did not study political theory enough and did not consult with the masses enough. Everyone immediately decided to establish systems such as "bringing books when going down, discussing心得after coming up, squeezing in time to study early and late, and studying collectively regularly" to insist on studying Mao Zedong's works, instructions from higher-level party committees, and party newspapers and periodicals. In formulating and implementing the autumn harvest and planting plan, all team cadres consciously consulted with the masses and held a "treasure offering" meeting for commune members to formulate plans according to local conditions, and all measures were implemented at the team level. As a result, the original autumn harvest and planting plan, which was scheduled to be completed in 20 days, was completed eight days ahead of schedule. Si Shiyou, a clerk from the County Industry Bureau, only paid attention to grasping production and neglected grasping ideology and life after being transferred to the Ninth Team of Longmiao Brigade in Longmiao Commune. During the comparison, team cadres and commune members raised opinions to him, and he immediately expressed his determination to correct them. The next day, he took the initiative to make close friends with commune members of poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds during labor to grasp the ideological dynamics of various classes and do ideological work in a thorough and meticulous manner. At the same time, he went to the canteen to work as a cook for a few days to improve the food. Under his leadership, this team's autumn planting this year was faster than in previous years.

This comparison also conscientiously summarized and promoted advanced experiences. The county party committee summarized and promoted the experience of Hu Shengji, deputy secretary of the County Communist Youth League Committee, who was good at grasping key points and leading team production well. After the party committee of Machang Commune organized commune and team cadres to conscientiously study and apply this experience, the commune's autumn harvest and planting plan this year was completed 20 days ahead of last year. Many team cadres said, "We have been working for so many years, grasping everything at once, but now after learning from experience, we realize that grasping the key is the main trick to doing a good job."

    比热爱农业　比坚持“四同”　比参加劳动　比执行政策
    沭阳二百多下放干部评为标兵
    通过评比干部们更加努力工作迅速向标兵看齐
    新华社南京26日电　江苏省沭阳县各级党委最近对深入农业生产第一线的县、社、大队三级干部的思想作风和工作情况，进行了一次检查评比。这次表扬了大批热爱农业，坚持“四同”的好干部，交流了工作经验，对进一步改进干部的工作作风和工作方法，密切干部和群众关系，推动当前生产，起了良好的作用。
    沭阳县从今年4月以来，先后选派了五千六百名县、社、大队级干部，到生产小队、作业组安家落户，担任党支部副书记、副队长、炊事员等，参加生产领导生产。这次在10月中旬开展的评比运动，着重进行“五查五比”：查思想，比热爱农业；查作风，比坚持四同；查工作，比点面结合；查劳动，比实做工分；查学习，比执行政策。评比方法采取从检查和总结工作入手，自报公议，肯定成绩和批评缺点。然后张榜公布，广泛征询小队干部和群众的意见，作出鉴定。群众公认的好干部中事迹突出的，报县委批准后，树立为全县标兵干部。全县共评选出好干部二千二百五十三名，先进单位一百二十八个，其中二百五十名干部被评为全县标兵。
    通过评比，受到表扬的干部，更加努力工作；受到批评的干部，尽快纠正缺点，迅速向标兵看齐。太平公社刘场大队支部书记黄以泉，被评为标兵后，作风更踏实，干劲更大，态度更虚心。他到泗阳农场向全县基层干部的标兵、农场场长张学同“取经”，回来后召开支部会“传经”，通过议论张学同的长处，发现部分同志学习政治理论不够，遇事同群众商量不够。大家立即决定建立“下去带书本，上来谈心得，早晚挤着学，定期集中学”等制度，坚持学习毛泽东著作、上级党委指示和党报党刊。在制订和执行秋收秋种计划中，全队干部都自觉地同群众商量，召开社员“献宝”会，因地制宜订规划，条条措施落实到队，结果原订二十天完成的秋收秋种计划提前八天完成了。县工业局文书司世友下放到龙庙公社龙庙大队第九小队后，只注意抓生产，忽视抓思想、抓生活，评比中，小队干部和社员对他提了意见，他立即表示决心改正。第二天就主动地在劳动中和贫农、下中农成分的社员交知心朋友，掌握各阶层思想动态，深入细致地做思想工作；同时深入食堂当了几天炊事员，改进了伙食。在他的带动下，这个小队今年的秋种比往年快。
    这次评比，还认真总结和推广先进经验。县委总结推广了共青团县委副书记胡生吉善于抓关键领导好小队生产的经验，马厂公社党委组织社、队干部认真学习和运用了这一经验后，使今年全社秋收秋种计划比去年提前二十天完成。不少小队干部说：“干了多少年工作，都是眉毛胡子一把抓，现在学经取宝后，才晓得抓关键是做好工作的主要窍门儿。”
