Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The Maolu Commune in Jintan County, Jiangsu Province, based on the basic completion of the autumn harvest and autumn planting, put forward the slogan "Rely on the mountains to eat from the mountains, rely on the mountains to build the mountains," and launched winter sideline production on a large scale, taking the production team as the unit.

This year, due to the correct implementation of the policy of "taking grain as the key link and making comprehensive arrangements," the total grain output of Maolu Commune increased by 100% compared to last year, and the cash income from diversified operations in various brigades has increased by 25% compared to last year. Recently, the Commune Party Committee organized cadres and commune members to discuss the experience of this year's double harvest of agriculture and sideline occupations, calling on everyone to continue to work hard and further change the face of the mountainous area. At the same time, combined with the production plan for this winter and next spring, it was arranged that while doing a good job in winter field management, all brigades should take advantage of the good opportunity of the relatively idle winter farm work to fully explore the potential of the mountainous area and launch sideline production on a large scale. The sideline occupations that the commune can engage in this winter include ten major categories: cutting, digging, mining, burning, collecting, hunting, weaving, raising, manufacturing, and transporting. Cutting means cutting mountain grass and wild plants; digging means digging medicinal materials; mining means mining stones, pebbles, white clay, and yellow sand; burning means burning lime, bricks, refractory bricks, and charcoal; collecting means collecting tree seeds and wild fruits; hunting means hunting; weaving means using wild bamboo and thatch to weave brooms, raincoats, and baskets; raising means focusing on raising pigs, raising poultry and livestock well, and using ponds and reservoirs to raise fish; manufacturing means exchanging mountain grass for rice straw to supply industrial paper making; transporting means doing a good job in short-distance transportation of agricultural, sideline, forestry, and special products. If the commune can grasp these winter sideline occupations well, it can strive to increase cash income by about 400,000 yuan before the Spring Festival, provide more funds for agricultural production next year, and increase the income of commune members.

How to launch winter sideline production on a large scale, given the characteristics of the mountainous area with more land and less labor, on the premise of first doing a good job in agricultural production? The Commune Party Committee put forward practical and effective measures based on existing experience. First, strengthen leadership and comprehensively plan. The Commune Party Committee appointed a deputy secretary to specifically take charge of sideline occupations, and each brigade had a deputy secretary and deputy captain specifically responsible for leading sideline production. Second, adhere to the policy of walking on two legs: developing both collective sideline occupations and commune members' household sideline occupations. Except for a few original large-scale collective economies that are still operated by the commune, the main part of winter sideline occupations is operated by the brigade. In addition to a few sideline occupations suitable for the brigade to operate in a centralized manner, such as brick kilns, quarrying, and short-distance transportation, the brigade will establish fixed professional teams and operate them directly. For projects that are not suitable for the brigade to operate directly, such as cutting thatch, digging medicinal materials, hunting, and collecting wild plants, quotas are set, and the contract is implemented by the team: contract for work, contract for output, contract for quality, contract for the amount of commodities, and rewards for exceeding the quota. Some projects that are not suitable for brigade management, such as raising pigs and growing vegetables in canteens, are managed by the team. Some sporadic sideline occupations that do not require much labor, such as raising poultry, pigs, sheep, and rabbits, and weaving straw sandals, raincoats, and baskets, are managed by commune members. Third, rationally arrange labor. Of the commune's 7,500 laborers, 3,750 people, or 50% of the labor force, are first assigned to engage in field management and fertilizer accumulation. Second, more than 600 people, about 8% of the labor force, are arranged to engage in small-scale water conservancy and supporting projects for the two reservoirs. 390 people, or more than 5% of the labor force, are arranged to grow vegetables. 300 people, or 4% of the labor force, are arranged to engage in collective life and welfare. The remaining 2,400 people, accounting for 32% of the labor force, are engaged in winter sideline occupations. According to the winter production plan, the actual labor requirement for various production tasks is more than 168,000 workdays. After comprehensive arrangements, after first fixing labor for agriculture, life, and other aspects, sideline production (including forestry field management) is still short of more than 30,000 workdays. After repeated discussions and studies, the brigades adopted the following methods: (1) Distinguish between primary and secondary tasks. For large-scale and strongly seasonal sideline occupations that must be completed before the freeze, such as cutting mountain grass, prioritize completion first, and postpone any sideline occupations that can be postponed, such as weaving and charcoal burning. (2) Except for brick kilns and collective breeding, which must establish relatively fixed professional teams, for certain seasonal sideline occupations contracted to production teams, the team can flexibly arrange labor and complete the task according to the requirements of the contract. (3) Improve labor efficiency by improving operating methods and reforming tools. For example, by adopting the operating method of concentrated felling and batch transportation for cutting mountain grass, the time for commune members to go back and forth to the mountains can be greatly saved, the work efficiency can be improved, and with the reform of tools and the realization of transportation by vehicles, it can save 20,000 workdays compared to the original decentralized cutting and transportation of grass. (4) Arrange sideline production according to individual conditions and give full play to the role of more than 800 town laborers and auxiliary laborers. (5) Use cattle power to complete the winter ploughing of young forest land in advance, freeing up more than 220 laborers from the forestry and mulberry professional team to rush to cut mountain grass or engage in other sideline occupations.

Due to specific planning, practical measures, and rational labor arrangements, the commune's action to launch winter sideline occupations on a large scale has started much earlier than in the past. In order to strive to complete the task of cutting 300,000 dan of mountain grass before the freeze, Hou Shunping, the first secretary of the Commune Party Committee, led cadres from communes and teams to go deep into Maoshan in mid-October to conduct on-site inspections, delineate areas, and assign contracts to teams. As soon as the autumn planting was over, 3,500 laborers were immediately organized to rush to the mountains. All brigades did planning and action simultaneously. After planning and listing 19 types of winter sideline occupations, the Tasha Brigade immediately organized a sideline occupation team to go to the mountains to cut thatch, and has now cut 240,000 jin. More than 200 mu of orchards in the Hongqi Forest Farm are being ploughed, treated for pests, and pruned to manage forest seedlings meticulously, striving to get the seedlings out of the nursery ahead of schedule. The forestry team of Changshan Brigade is strengthening the management of 170 mu of forest seedlings that are about to be released from the nursery and organizing commune members to dig wild pears. The team digging and transporting refractory clay in Qingpei Brigade has increased the brigade's income by 2,000 yuan.

In order to strongly support the winter sideline production of various teams, the supply and marketing departments have also strengthened their purchasing power and added purchasing points. The hunters of various brigades have become more active since signing sales contracts with the supply and marketing cooperatives. They carry their homemade guns to the mountains to hunt early every morning. Wang Cai's hunting team of three people hunted 65 pheasants and hares in four days. (Attached picture)

    茅麓公社贯彻政策全面规划统一安排
    以队为单位大搞冬季副业生产
    合理安排劳力保证发展集体经营，同时发动社员利用冬闲从事家庭经营
    本报讯　据南京新华日报消息：江苏省金坛县茅麓公社在秋收秋种基本结束的基础上，提出“靠山吃山、靠山建山”的口号，以大队为单位大搞冬季副业生产。
    茅麓公社今年由于正确贯彻了“以粮为纲、全面安排”的方针，全社粮食总产量比去年增产一倍，各个大队发展多种经营的现金收入已比去年增加25％。最近，公社党委组织干部和社员座谈了今年农、副业双丰收的经验，号召大家继续发愤图强，进一步改变山区面貌。同时结合今冬明春生产规划，部署各个大队在搞好冬季田间管理的同时，利用冬季农活较闲的大好时机，充分挖掘山区潜力，大搞副业生产。今年冬季全社可以经营的副业，计有割、挖、开、烧、采、打、编、养、造、运等十大类。割，就是割山草和野生植物；挖，就是挖药材；开，就是开采石子、石块、白泥、黄沙；烧，就是烧石灰、砖瓦、耐火砖、木炭；采，就是采集树种、野生果子；打，就是打猎；编，就是利用野生竹子、茅草编织扫帚、蓑衣、箩筐；养，就是以养猪为中心，养好家禽家畜，并利用塘坝水库养鱼；造，就是以山草换出稻草，供应工业造纸；运，就是搞好农副业和林特产品的短途运输。全社如能抓好这些冬季副业，就能争取在春节前增加四十万元左右的现金收入，为明年农业生产提供更多的资金，使社员增加更多的收入。
    如何根据山区地多劳力少的特点，在首先搞好农业生产的前提下，大搞冬季副业呢？公社党委根据已有经验提出了切实有效的措施。第一，加强领导，全面规划。公社党委指定副书记专门抓副业，各大队都有副书记、副队长具体负责领导副业生产。第二，坚持发展集体副业和社员家庭副业两条腿走路的方针。除了少数原有大型的集体经济仍由公社经营外，冬季副业的主要部分归大队经营。各个大队除将烧窑、采石、短途运输等少数适宜大队集中经营的副业，统一建立固定的专业队伍，由大队直接经营外，对割茅草、挖药材、打猎、采集野生植物等不适宜大队直接经营的项目，分别制订定额，实行包工、包产、包质、包商品量和超额奖励，具体包给小队经营。对小部分不适宜大队经营的项目，如食堂养猪、种菜归小队经营。有些花劳动力不多的零星副业，如饲养家禽、猪、羊、兔，编织草鞋、蓑衣、提箩等由社员经营。第三，合理安排劳力。全社七千五百个劳力，首先安排三千七百五十人，即50％的劳力搞田间管理和积肥。其次，安排六百多人，约8％的劳力搞小型水利和两个水库的配套工程。安排三百九十人，即5％以上的劳力种蔬菜。安排三百人，即4％的劳力搞集体生活福利。余下二千四百人，占32％的劳力搞冬季副业。按照冬季生产规划，各项生产实际需要用工量是十六万八千多个劳动日，经过全面安排，首先固定农业、生活等方面劳力后，副业生产（包括林业田间管理在内）还缺少三万多个劳动日。经过反复讨论研究，各大队采取了这样几个办法：（一）分清主次，对必须抢在封冻以前完成的大宗的、季节性较强的副业，如割山草等，首先突击完成，把凡是可以推迟的副业，如编织、烧木炭等，都暂时推迟一步。（二）除了烧窑、集体饲养等必须建立比较固定的专业队伍外，凡是包给生产小队的某些季节性不很强的副业，一律由小队根据承包的任务要求，灵活安排劳力和完成任务的时间。（三）通过改进操作方法和改革工具，提高劳动工效。例如，割山草，采取突击砍伐，成批运输的操作方法，就可大大节省社员往返上山的时间，提高工效，加上改革工具，实现运输车子化，割草运草就可比原来分散割运节省两万个劳动日。（四）因人制宜地安排副业生产，发挥八百多个集镇劳力和辅助劳力的作用。（五）利用牛力提前突击完成幼林地的冬翻工作，腾出林桑专业队二百二十多个劳力抢割山草，或搞其他副业。
    由于规划具体，措施切实，劳力安排合理，这个公社大搞冬季副业的行动比过去大大提前。为了争取在封冻前完成三十万担山草的砍伐任务，公社党委第一书记侯顺平早在10月中旬就带领社队干部深入茅山实地察看，划区定队包干，秋种一结束，立即组织三千五百个劳力上山突击。各个大队都做到边规划、边行动。塔山大队经过规划，排出十九种冬季副业门路后，马上组织副业队上山割茅草，现已割了二十四万斤。红旗林场二百多亩果林正在翻土治虫、整枝，精工管理林苗，争取林苗提前出圃。长山大队的林业队，一面加强快要出圃的一百七十亩林苗的管理，一面组织社员挖野棠梨。清培大队挖、运耐火泥的小组已为大队增加了二千元收入。
    供销部门为了有力地支持各队冬季副业生产，也加强了收购力量，增设了收购点。各个大队的打猎手，自与供销社订立销货合同后，积极性更高了，每天一大早就扛着土枪上山打猎。王才有打猎组三个人，四天中就打到六十五只野鸡和野兔。（附图片）
