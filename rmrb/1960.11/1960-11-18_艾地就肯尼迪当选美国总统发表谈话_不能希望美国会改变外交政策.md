Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 14th: According to a report by Antara News Agency on the 14th, Indonesian Communist Party Chairman D.N. Aidit, in response to a question from an Antara News Agency reporter regarding Kennedy's election as US President, said that the change of US President does not mean that there will be any change in US foreign policy.

Aidit said, "We are already able to see what Kennedy will do in the future. For example, Kennedy has stated that he will continue to employ Allen Dulles (as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency) and J. Edgar Hoover (as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation). These names are reminiscent of the late John Foster Dulles and McCarthy. Judging from this fact alone, it is impossible for us to hope that Eisenhower's policies will change in the slightest."

Aidit pointed out that another piece of evidence is that Kennedy, in the fifth point of his five-point program, clamored to continue attempting to "liberate" socialist countries. This is precisely a policy of continuing to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and carrying out subversive activities against other countries.

    艾地就肯尼迪当选美国总统发表谈话
    不能希望美国会改变外交政策
    新华社雅加达电　据安塔拉通讯社14日报道，印度尼西亚共产党主席艾地在答复安塔拉通讯社记者提出的关于肯尼迪当选为美国总统的问题时说，美国总统的更换并不意味着美国的外交政策将有所改变。
    艾地说，“我们已经能够看到肯尼迪在将来会做什么事情。例如，肯尼迪表示，他将继续任用艾伦·杜勒斯（为中央情报局局长）和埃德加·胡佛（为联邦调查局局长）。这些名字使人想起已故的约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯和麦卡锡。单单从这个事实来判断，我们就不可能希望，艾森豪威尔的政策将会有丝毫改变。”
    艾地指出，另一个证据是，肯尼迪在他的五点纲领中的第五点叫嚷将继续企图“解放”社会主义国家。这正是继续干涉其他国家的内政并对其他国家进行颠覆活动的政策。
