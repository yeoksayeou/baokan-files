Communist Labor and the Transformation of People
——Watching the Soviet Film "On the Barren Banks of the River"
Guan Long

    On the barren banks of the Irtysh River in Kazakhstan, Soviet Union.
    Bare, stern mountains, rapid rivers, piles of rocks on both sides of the construction site, gray concrete, roaring machinery.... For people like Alizhanov, who are full of bourgeois individualism, shortsighted, and pursue personal fame and gain, this life is gray, monotonous, and boring. This is not a big city, and there are none of the "grand theaters, fashion stores, restaurants, and beautiful and comfortable living" that people like them yearn for. However, for those who are dedicated to communist construction, far-sighted, and have the great communist ideals—outstanding Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and millions of ordinary Soviet people—life here is as magnificent as a poem. Two different worldviews lead to two completely different views of this reality.
    In order to build a giant hydropower station ahead of schedule and accelerate the Soviet Union's communist construction, these heroic Soviet people, both the older and younger generations, are vigorously engaged in a thrilling battle against nature here. For the sake of communist construction, they have dedicated everything: wisdom, strength, and youth. They paint the most moving pictures in the desolate nature, sing the most moving poems, and organically intertwine all their thoughts and feelings with communist construction. As Chief Engineer Vakulin taught Zhanai: "...Is the entire meaning of our lives just positions and rewards? That's too small! Life is labor, and I'm not afraid of living an ordinary life. These sleepless nights, mistakes, failures, and hoarse voices, it's so happy, all the happiness is made by us, not by anyone else, ah, it's us, do you understand?" This is how much they love labor, how full of collective heroic pride, and how profound their understanding of labor is! Obviously, among these people, the new quality of labor becoming "life's primary need" is growing, and a new style of communism is taking shape. Therefore, in our view, the construction of the hydropower station on the banks of the Irtysh River is far more than just a huge project, a complex structure, and a simple combination of laborers. We see wealth and materials, but more importantly, we see the creators and builders of wealth—people. Through people's conscious, heroic labor, this collective composed of countless laborers has become a school that conducts communist ideological education for people, a melting pot that transforms both nature and people. And the film's ideological theme starts from this point. Through the development of the main plot involving Ularov, the director of the work area, Vakulin, the chief engineer, Grigory, the captain of the concrete team, etc., the film sings the praises of the Soviet people's selfless communist labor, while the other plot line between Ularov and Zhanai fully demonstrates another central idea of the film: the issue of human transformation. These two clues are intertwined, making the unfolding of the theme and ideas particularly vivid and lively, and helping to portray various aspects of the characters' personalities.
    Ularov, the director of the work area, is the most prominent and successful image in the film. He embodies the excellent qualities of communist labor enthusiasm and a conscious attitude towards labor. He is a commander of a work area, and he is also an educator. He is an old Bolshevik who came from the Red Army. His most prominent characteristic is his infinite loyalty to the cause of the Party. Like countless Communist Party members, Ularov loves his cause and can go through fire and water to complete all the work entrusted to him by the Party. He enthusiastically supports and rejoices in everything that is beneficial to the Party, and he firmly opposes everything that is detrimental to the Party's cause. He has clear love and hatred, and clear rewards and punishments. There is no ambiguity or equivocation, which is precisely the strongest manifestation of his Party spirit. These characteristics are clearly illustrated in his attitude towards Grigory, Alizhanov, and his son Zhanai. He fully supports Grigory's innovation and feels sincerely proud because of it. He expresses deep disgust for Alizhanov, an ambitious man who is corroded by bourgeois individualism and has a strong sense of vanity and egoism. Together with Fajima, a member of the Party committee, he publicly accused Alizhanov of his despicable behavior and dismissed him from his position as deputy chief engineer on the spot. He felt pain and regret for his son Zhanai's misdeeds in college, regretting that he had not paid attention to his education in the past, and was so angry that he beat him with a whip. However, when Zhanai improved his shortcomings and made progress, becoming an excellent concrete worker, he felt full of joy. Ularov is not without shortcomings. He initially criticized Vakulin's conservative ideas, asking him to break with convention, which was correct. However, due to being too hasty, he ordered blasting to replace manual removal of rocks, which damaged the rock foundation and caused difficulties for the project. However, when he realized he was wrong, he immediately admitted his mistake to Vakulin, which showed how bravely this selfless person bowed to the truth.
    Grigory, the captain of the concrete team, is an outstanding representative of the younger generation. He is a Communist Party member with a strong will, daring to think and act, and a high degree of awareness. After countless sleepless nights, he worked hard to study and carried out technical innovation, creating a pouring method that crushed stones and mixed them into concrete. This not only saved 40% of the concrete, increased the strength of the dam, but also ensured the early completion of the project. As a Communist Party member, he not only cares about production, but also cares about all aspects of everyone in the collective. With his help, the members of the team were able to quickly overcome their shortcomings and improve their awareness and cultural and technical level, and finally won the honorary title of Communist Labor Shock Brigade. Zhanai's progress and transformation are inseparable from his help. Grigory adheres to principles and dares to fight against bad people and bad deeds. He fought with Alizhanov over the issue of bolt caps. His heroic act of risking his life to protect state property educated all the team members.
    Daika, this young female crane operator, loves life, loves labor, and is full of youthful vitality. She also has her own rich inner life. She said to Zhanai: "This place, it tests people..." And she, an excellent crane operator, a girl who dedicated her youth to communist construction, can withstand the severe test.
    The entire work area under the leadership of the work area Party committee and Ularov is a vibrant and striving fighting collective, but in this collective, just like in other places in society, when the bourgeoisie abroad has not yet been eliminated, and the ideological influence and remnants of the domestic bourgeoisie still exist, there must still be a struggle between two paths and two worldviews in the ideological field. The bourgeois individualism represented by Alizhanov is sharply opposed to and incompatible with the proletarian collectivism of Ularov and others. Alizhanov is an ignorant and spiritually empty person. After barely graduating from university, he relied on a little cleverness to climb up to the position of deputy chief engineer step by step. His selfishness and vanity even led him to use flattery, harm, instigation, and ingratiation in an attempt to further steal the position of chief engineer. But no matter how cunning and insidious he is, his false accusation of Vakulin's wrongdoing is eventually exposed. The Party gave him severe criticism in an attempt to save and educate him, but cadres like Alizhanov, who are corrupted by bourgeois individualistic ideas, will not engage in conscious labor with a heroic attitude. Due to his dereliction of duty, he caused a serious work-related injury accident and was punished by the people's court.
    Zhanai's short twenty years of life were spent in a greenhouse. After graduating from middle school, he went directly to university. He could have taken solid steps on the road paved by his predecessors to life. However, Zhanai did not do this. He was attacked by bourgeois ideas to the point of being beyond redemption, and was finally expelled from university. For the older generation who had gone through life and death and seized power from the enemy in the revolutionary era, they deeply understood life and knew how the new system and life came about. Old Ularov was not pessimistic and disappointed because of this. He directly sent his son to this university of communist labor. He said to his son: "Taste the bread of real labor," "I didn't go to life this way." Old Ularov insisted on the Marxist-Leninist educational principles and received good results. His son finally became a glorious member of the advanced collective.
    The road that Zhanai took was not easy at first. The hopper could not be opened, he was clumsy, and his hand was smashed, and he was ridiculed by the workers, who called him "young master," but everyone could see clearly that this was "treating the symptoms." The master-style detachment from reality, detachment from productive labor, and detachment from the masses can only be transformed in labor, can overcome impetuousness and rashness, and can enable all correct ideas to be implemented and developed in people's minds.
    This film has realistic educational significance for the broad masses of audiences in our country. The magnificent spirit of communist construction shown in the film is a great encouragement and education for the heroic Chinese people—the builders of the great motherland. We are also in the socialist construction of our motherland, which is developing rapidly in a stormy and leaping manner. In this great era of surpassing, catching up, helping, chasing, racing against time, and striving for complete victory, the noble qualities and communist labor attitude of Ularov and others, who are wholeheartedly working for the Party, are worth learning from.
    But for us, the realistic significance of this film is more than that. The film runs through the communist educational principles. Alizhanov's depravity and Zhanai's mistakes repeatedly sound the alarm for us: we must not relax the struggle against the bourgeois worldview in the slightest, and we must adhere to the Marxist-Leninist line and educational policy of intellectualization of labor. Alizhanov's fate and Zhanai's road and transformation from "young master" and "hooligan" to communist laborer powerfully tell us: if intellectuals do not put down their airs, take the masses as teachers, and transform themselves in labor in a down-to-earth manner, and follow the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao: move the foothold over, move to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, move to the side of the proletariat, then they will accomplish nothing. If they allow bourgeois ideas to develop freely, then they will suffer the consequences. The idea of labor education shown in the film through the theme of Soviet people's communist construction helps us to further recognize the correctness and brilliance of the policy put forward by our Party that universities and colleges should better promote the intellectualization of labor and the combination of education and productive labor.

    共产主义劳动和人的改造
    ——看苏联影片《在荒凉的河岸上》
    管珑
    在苏联哈萨克斯坦伊尔特什荒凉的河岸上。
    光秃秃的严峻的山，急湍的河流，两岸工地上成堆的岩块，灰色的混凝土，轰响着的各种机器……。对于像阿里扎诺夫那样满脑袋资产阶级个人主义思想、眼光短浅、追逐个人名利的人来说，这个生活是灰色、单调和乏味的，这里不是大城市，没有他们这一类人所向往的“大剧院、时装店、餐厅和美丽舒适的生活。”然而对于献身共产主义建设、高瞻远瞩、具有共产主义伟大胸怀的人们——优秀的共产党员、共青团员和千百万普通的苏维埃人民来说，这里的生活是诗一样壮丽的。两种不同的世界观，对这个现实便有着两种绝然不同的看法。
    为了提前建设一座巨型的水电站，加速苏联的共产主义建设事业，这些英雄的苏维埃人，无论是老一代或是年青一代，生龙活虎地在这里向大自然展开了惊心动魄的战斗。他们为着共产主义的建设，献出了自己的一切：智慧、力量和青春。在荒凉的大自然中画出最动人的画面，唱出最动人的诗篇，把自己的全部思想、感情都与共产主义建设有机地交织在一起了。正如总工程师瓦库林教导日阿奈时说的：“……难道我们生活的全部意义就是职位与奖赏？那可是太渺小了！生活就是劳动，再过得平凡，我也不怕。这些不眠之夜，错误、失败，嗓子都吵哑了，这么快乐，快乐的一切都是我们作出来的，而不是什么别的人，啊，是我们，你懂吗？”这是多么热爱劳动，多么富有集体英雄主义的自豪感，对劳动的理解又是多么的深刻！显然，在这些人中间劳动成为“生活第一需要”的新品质正在成长，共产主义的新风格正在形成。因此，伊尔特什河岸上水电站的建设，在我们看来，远不止是庞大的工程、复杂的结构和劳动者的简单组合，我们看到财富与物质，更重要的还在于看到财富的创造者、建设者——人。通过人们自觉的、主人公的劳动，这个由无数劳动者组合的集体，已成为一所向人们进行共产主义思想教育的学校，既是改造自然，又是改造人的熔炉。而影片的思想主题正是从这一点着眼的。通过工区主任乌拉洛夫和总工程师瓦库林、混凝土队队长格里高利等人的主要情节的展开，影片歌颂了苏维埃人的共产主义的忘我劳动，而通过乌拉洛夫和日阿奈的另一条情节线索，则充分地表明了影片的另一个中心思想：即人的改造问题。这两条线索互相交错起来，使主题、思想的展开显得分外生动、活泼，而且有助于刻画人物性格的各个方面。
    工区主任乌拉洛夫是影片中塑造得最为突出、最为成功的形象。在他身上集中地体现出共产主义的劳动热情和自觉的劳动态度的优秀品质。他是一个工区的指挥员，他也是一个教育者。他是一个红军出身的老布尔什维克，最突出的特点是：对党的事业的无限忠诚。像无数共产党员一样，乌拉洛夫热爱自己的事业，能够赴汤蹈火地去完成党所委托给他的一切工作。凡是对党有利的，他都热情支持，欢欣鼓舞，凡是有损于党的事业的，他都坚决反对，他爱憎分明、赏罚分明，没有含糊其辞，模棱两可的情况，而这正是他的党性的最强表现。在对待格里高利、阿里扎诺夫和自己的儿子日阿奈的态度上，便清楚地说明了这些特点。他全力支持格里高利的革新，并因此而感到由衷的骄傲。而对于为资产阶级个人主义思想所腐蚀了的虚荣、利己心极重的野心家阿里扎诺夫，则表示深恶痛绝，他和党委委员法吉玛在一起，当面指责了阿里扎诺夫的卑劣行为，当场撤销了他的副总工程师职务。他对于儿子日阿奈在大学里的胡作非为感到痛心，悔恨自己当年没有注意对他的教育，气得竟用鞭子来抽打他，但是当日阿奈改进了缺点并且有了进步，成为一个出色的混凝土工时，他又感到满心欢喜。乌拉洛夫并不是没有缺点的。他最初批评了瓦库林的保守思想，要他打破常规，这是对的。但由于操之过急，竟下令以爆破代替用人工清除石块，以致损坏了岩石地基，给工程造成了困难，但当他发现自己错了，就立刻向瓦库林承认错误，这表现了这个毫无私心的人是多么勇于向真理低头。
    混凝土队队长格里高利是青年一代的杰出代表，这是一个意志坚强、敢想敢干、具有高度觉悟的共产党员。经过无数个不眠之夜，刻苦钻研，进行了技术革新，创造了将石头粉碎后掺进混凝土中去的浇灌法，这样不仅节约40％的混凝土，增加了坝子的强度，而且还保证了工程的提前完工。作为一个共产党员，他不仅关心生产，而且关心集体中每个人的各个方面，由于他的帮助，队里的成员能够迅速克服自己的缺点，提高了觉悟与文化技术水平，终于获得了共产主义劳动突击队的光荣称号。日阿奈的进步与转变就是和他的帮助分不开的。格里高利坚持原则，敢于和坏人坏事进行斗争，因为螺栓帽的事，他和阿里扎诺夫进行了斗争。他的冒着生命危险保护国家财产的英雄行为，教育了全体队员。
    达依卡，这个年青的女起重机手热爱生活，热爱劳动，富有青春的活力，她也有自己丰富的内心生活的。她对日阿奈说：“这个地方，考验人哪……”而她，出色的起重机手，为共产主义建设献出自己青春的姑娘，是经受得起严峻考验的。
    在工区党委和乌拉洛夫领导下的整个工区是一个朝气蓬勃、力争上游的战斗集体，但是在这个集体里，正如和社会上其他地方一样，当国外资产阶级尚未消灭，国内资产阶级的思想影响及其残余还存在的时候，在思想领域中必然还存在着两条道路、两种世界观的斗争。阿里扎诺夫所代表的资产阶级个人主义思想是和乌拉洛夫等人的无产阶级集体主义思想针锋相对、格格不入的。阿里扎诺夫是一个不学无术、精神空虚的人，大学勉强毕业后，靠着一点小聪明，一步步爬上副总工程师的职位，他的自私自利、虚荣心竟使他用谄害和挑拨离间、阿谀奉迎的手段，妄图进一步窃取总工程师的职位。但是无论他怎样狡猾和阴险，他的诬告瓦库林的勾当终被揭穿，党给了他以严厉的批评力图挽救、教育他，但是像阿里扎诺夫这样为资产阶级个人主义思想腐蚀了的干部是不会用主人公的态度进行自觉劳动的。由于他的失职，造成严重的工伤事故，而受到人民法庭的惩处。
    日阿奈短短的二十年生命，是在温室里度过的。中学毕业后，他直接升入大学，他原可在前辈铺平的道路上，迈开坚实的步子走向生活的。然而日阿奈没有这样做。他受到了资产阶级思想的袭击以致不可收拾，终于被大学开除。对于曾经出生入死，在革命的年代里从敌人手中夺得政权的老一代人来说，是深刻地了解生活，并且知道新的制度和生活是如何得来的。老乌拉洛夫并没有因此而悲观失望，他直接把儿子送进这所共产主义劳动的大学，他对儿子说：“尝尝真正劳动的面包”，“我可不是这样走向生活的。”老乌拉洛夫坚持了马克思列宁主义的教育原则，而收到了良好的果实，他的儿子终于成为先进集体里的光荣一员。
    日阿奈所走的这条道路最初并不是容易的。料斗拉不开，笨手笨脚，并且把手也砸破了，受到工人们的嘲笑，称他为“少爷”，但是大家看得很清楚，这正是“对症下药”，老爷式的脱离实际、脱离生产劳动和脱离群众，只能在劳动中得到改造，才能克服浮躁和轻率，才能使一切正确的思想在人的头脑中落实和发展。
    这部影片对于我国的广大观众来说，有着现实的教育意义。影片中所展示的这种共产主义建设的壮丽气魄，对于英雄的中国人民——伟大祖国的建设者来说，是莫大的鼓舞与教育。我们也正处于祖国急风骤雨，飞跃发展的社会主义建设里，在这超、赶、帮、追，分秒必争，力取全胜的大时代，乌拉洛夫等的忠心耿耿为党工作的高贵品质和共产主义的劳动态度，是值得我们学习和借鉴的。
    但是对于我们来说，这部影片的现实意义还不止此。影片贯穿着共产主义教育原则，阿里扎诺夫的堕落、日阿奈的错误一再向我们敲起警钟：我们丝毫不能放松对资产阶级世界观的斗争，必须坚持知识分子劳动化这一马克思列宁主义路线和教育方针。阿里扎诺夫的下场和日阿奈由“少爷”、“阿飞”到共产主义的劳动者的道路和转变过程，有力地告诉我们：知识分子如果不放下架子，拜群众为师，踏踏实实地在劳动中改造自己，遵照我们伟大的领袖毛主席所指示的：把立足点移过来，移到工农兵方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来，则将一事无成，如果听任资产阶级思想自由发展下去，则将自食其果。影片中通过苏维埃人民共产主义建设的主题所表明的劳动教育的思想，帮助我们进一步认识到我们党所提出的高等学校要更好地促进知识分子劳动化、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的正确与英明。
