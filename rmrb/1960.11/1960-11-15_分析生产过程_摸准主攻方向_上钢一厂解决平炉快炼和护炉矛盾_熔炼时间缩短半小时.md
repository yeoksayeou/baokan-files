Our Shanghai dispatch on November 14th: The Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, through analyzing and categorizing steelmaking and non-steelmaking times, has identified key areas for increased production. This has ensured continuous improvement in utilization coefficients, a steel qualification rate of 99.38%, and a steady reduction in iron consumption. In the third quarter's national small open-hearth furnace competition, it continued to win the glorious title of National Red Flag.

During the increase production and conservation campaign centered on grain and steel, leading cadres of the plant's Party General Branch and workers sought ways to significantly increase production. Some people believed that the 30-ton furnace was already loaded with 70 tons, making further substantial increases impossible. However, many workers used facts to demonstrate that there was still great potential for increasing production. To further tap into production potential, the Party General Branch worked with the workers to meticulously analyze the production situation for the month of August. They categorized the daily steelmaking and non-steelmaking times, and discovered that a total of 173 hours of steelmaking time were lost due to poor furnace maintenance and other direct and indirect equipment-related issues. This lost time could have produced over 2,000 tons of steel. By calculating the details, they found the main area of focus. The Party General Branch then mobilized everyone to find the reasons for the poor furnace maintenance. The workers believed that quick steelmaking was the main way to increase steel production, but if the furnaces were not well maintained and developed problems, significant increases would of course be impossible. Whether the furnaces were well maintained was related to the current furnace maintenance system. The existing system assigned furnace maintenance to furnace maintenance workers, while steelworkers only focused on steelmaking. This furnace maintenance system needed to be adjusted, so that steelworkers would be responsible for maintaining the furnaces. Many people also felt that the fact that the furnace maintenance situation was not included as an evaluation condition in the team competitions was a shortcoming that needed to be corrected. The Party General Branch listened to the opinions of the masses, and based on the characteristics of open-hearth steelmaking, established a "seven-package" system with the furnace seat as the unit, which includes: packaged tasks, packaged ideological work, packaged furnace protection, packaged management, packaged variety and quality, packaged safety, and packaged promotion of advanced experiences. At the same time, competitions were organized with the furnace seat as the unit.

After the implementation of the seven-package system and the seven-package competition, the contradiction between rapid steelmaking and furnace protection was smoothly resolved. Steelworkers not only focused on rapid steelmaking, but also paid attention to careful maintenance of the furnace body during operations such as feeding and stirring. After each heat of steel, Wan Yongren, a worker from the B shift of No. 1 furnace, would clean the gas ramp to prevent the gas from rushing upwards and damaging the furnace roof. As a result of everyone protecting the furnace, new furnaces became younger and old furnaces were rejuvenated. Steelmaking time was repeatedly shortened. Before the reform of the system, it took an average of about six hours to make a heat of steel in August, but in September it only took about five and a half hours. As a result, more than ten more heats of steel were made than in August, and output increased by 10.5%.

The new system has also achieved significant results in promoting cadres to further immerse themselves among the masses and lead them. After cadres participated in the competition and took responsibility for political and ideological work, the ideological leadership of the Party branch was further strengthened. In the past, only the duty officer and the Party branch secretary participated in the leadership of the core group for team competitions. Now, in addition to these two, each furnace seat has a deputy director of the workshop responsible for production, a furnace maintenance worker, a gas furnace foreman, a charging team leader, and two technicians. The core group personnel and the workers jointly planned production, carefully calculated costs, focused on output, and discussed matters at the furnace every day. The organization of production and competition work became more detailed and timely. Veteran worker Gu Jianxing successfully experimented with a rapid method of feeding both cold and hot materials into the furnace together for 125 consecutive days, which could shorten the smelting time of each heat of steel by 24 minutes. However, a key problem was not solved and could not be universally promoted. Cadres from the two furnace seats took the workers to Gu Jianxing's team to observe and learn, taking responsibility for the promotion of this advanced experience. Through joint efforts, the key problem in the promotion was finally solved, and the advanced experience quickly blossomed and bore fruit in various teams.

    分析生产过程  摸准主攻方向
    上钢一厂解决平炉快炼和护炉矛盾　熔炼时间缩短半小时
    本报上海14日电　上海第一钢铁厂平炉车间，通过排队检查炼钢和非炼钢时间的办法，寻找增产关键，从而保证了利用系数一再提高，钢的合格率达99.38％，铁耗一降再降。在第三季度全国小型平炉竞赛评比中，继续取得全国红旗的光荣称号。
    在以粮钢为中心的增产节约运动中，这个厂的党总支领导干部和工人寻找大幅度增产的途径。当时有些人认为：三十吨炉子现在已装七十吨了，再大幅度增产是不可能了。但很多工人用事实说明，增产的潜力仍然很大。为了进一步挖掘生产潜力，党总支就和工人一起细致地解剖8月份一个月的生产情况，把每天的炼钢和非炼钢时间进行排队检查，结果发现仅仅因护炉不好和其它设备直接间接的影响就损失炼钢时间一百七十三个小时，这些时间可生产二千多吨钢。通过算细账，找到了主攻方向。接着党总支就发动大家找炉子维护不好的原因。工人们认为快炼是增产钢的主要途径，但如果炉子维护不好，出了毛病，大幅度增产当然也就不可能。而炉子维护得好不好，又和现行的护炉制度有关。现行的制度护炉由护炉员负责，炼钢工人只管炼钢；这样的护炉制度就需要加以调整，把炉子包给炼钢工人维护。很多人又认为班组竞赛不把护炉情况作为评比条件也是一个缺点，需要改正。党总支倾听了群众意见，根据平炉炼钢的特点，建立了以炉座为单位的包任务、包思想、包护炉、包管理、包品种质量、包安全、包先进经验推广的“七包”制度，同时以炉座为单位，开展竞赛。
    七包制和七包竞赛推行以后，首先顺利地解决了快炼和护炉的矛盾。炼钢工不仅注意快炼，在进料、搅拌等操作中，都注意精心维护炉体。一号炉乙班工人万永仁在每炼一炉钢后，都要把煤气斜道清理一次，不使煤气往上冲，烧坏炉顶。人人护炉的结果，新炉子更加年青，老炉子返老还童。炼钢时间一再缩短，在改革制度以前，8月份炼一炉钢平均要六小时左右，9月份只要五个半小时左右，这样，就比8月份多炼了十多炉钢。产量增长10.5％。
    新的制度在推动干部进一步深入群众领导群众方面，也收到了显著的效果。干部参加竞赛包政治思想工作后，进一步加强了党支部的思想领导。过去，班组竞赛，干部中只有值班主任、党支部书记参加核心组领导。现在，除了他们二人以外，每只炉座都有一个车间生产副主任、护炉员、煤气炉炉长、上料组组长和二个技术员参加。核心组人员和工人群众一起班班排计划、算细账、抓产量，天天在炉前碰头商量；生产与竞赛的组织工作，做得更细致及时。老工人顾建兴连续一百二十五天试验成功冷热料一起进炉的快速法，每炉钢冶炼时间可缩短二十四分钟。可是，有一个关键问题没解决，因此不能普遍推广，两个炉座的干部就带着工人一起到顾建兴班观摩学习，包这项先进经验的推广。经过共同努力，推广中的关键问题终于解决了，使先进经验在各班迅速开花结果。
