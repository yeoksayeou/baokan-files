The Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has increased its grain production this year, achieving self-sufficiency in grain for the first time. This is a great victory for us in resolutely implementing the Party Central Committee's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation for developing the national economy and the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee's proposal of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations" in pastoral areas. It has laid a solid material foundation for the development and acceleration of socialist construction in the Yushu area.

The Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is located in the southwest of Qinghai Province, covering an area of more than 200,000 square kilometers. More than 85% of the residents are Tibetans, and the rest are Han, Hui, Tu, and other ethnic groups. The Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region (renamed Autonomous Prefecture in 1955) was formally established in February 1952 and is the earliest region in Qinghai Province to establish ethnic regional autonomy. Located in the central part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the terrain is an average of about 4,000 meters above sea level. However, the area has crisscrossing rivers, dense lakes, abundant rainfall, and fertile soil. Especially along the Tongtian River and Lancang River in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the climate is generally mild and suitable for reclamation and cultivation, offering broad prospects for developing agriculture. According to historical records, the Yushu area began engaging in agriculture more than 500 years ago. However, due to the long-term exploitation and oppression of the broad masses by the feudal ruling class, production developed extremely slowly. At the time of liberation, only Yushu, Angqian, Chengduo, and other counties had a small amount of cultivated land, and cultivation was rough. Grain yield per mu was only seventy or eighty jin. Poor herders often relied on swan roots, grass seeds, and a small amount of meat to satisfy their hunger. After liberation, in order to improve the lives of the herders, the Party and the People's Government transported large quantities of grain from thousands of miles away. While leading the masses to develop animal husbandry production, they vigorously promoted land reclamation and agricultural development. However, before the completion of the democratic reforms, the reactionary classes used various feudal privileges to obstruct and sabotage in every possible way. In addition, the herders were not organized at that time and their strength was weak. By the end of 1957, the cultivated area had only increased to about 150,000 mu.

In order to rapidly change the face of the Yushu area and accelerate socialist construction, the people of the entire prefecture, under the leadership of Party organizations at all levels and on the basis of the decisive victory of the socialist revolution in pastoral areas and the realization of people's communes in 1958, conscientiously implemented the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation for developing the national economy. After more than two years of efforts by the entire Party and the people, the sown area has increased more than twenty times compared with before liberation. People of all ethnic groups have planted dozens of crops such as wheat, barley, rapeseed, sugar beet, and potatoes at the source of the river at an altitude of 4,000 meters, and have achieved a bumper harvest. Practice has proven that the Yushu area can not only develop agriculture, but also has great potential. This year, agricultural production in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has been extensively planted and well managed. After winning great victories in land reclamation and spring sowing, the people of the whole prefecture took advantage of the victory to engage in field management centered on weeding, with high yield formulas as the key. They also tried every means to fight against natural disasters such as frost and hail. A scene of bumper harvest appeared on the entire Yushu grassland. The commune members happily sang: "The People's Commune has great power, and is not afraid of any difficulties; after a year of hard work, the flowers of happiness bloom this year." The broad masses are joyfully carrying out the autumn harvest and threshing, launching full-attendance, high-quality, and high-efficiency labor competitions, and at the same time carrying out autumn plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and actively preparing for winter sowing, striving for a greater bumper harvest next year.

Vigorously developing agriculture and grain production is of utmost importance to accelerating socialist construction in the Yushu area. Due to the large-scale reclamation of wasteland and the vigorous development of agriculture, agriculture is distributed throughout the prefecture, and every commune and team grows crops, thus changing the past situation of solely engaging in animal husbandry in vast areas of the west and creating a material foundation for the development of diversified operations. The superstition that "agriculture cannot be developed on the plateau" has been broken. In Qumalai, Zaduo and other places with altitudes as high as 4,000 meters, not only have crops been grown, but also bumper harvests have been achieved. This has greatly encouraged people's determination to change nature. Because every commune and team grows crops, ensuring that people have grain and livestock have grass, the method of animal husbandry solely relying on natural grazing has been gradually changed, and the development of animal husbandry has been strongly promoted. This year, all kinds of livestock on the grassland are fat and strong, the conception rate of female animals is high, and the survival rate of young animals is high. Many sheep give birth to twin or triple lambs, and cattle give birth to twin calves. New technologies such as artificial estrus and hot mating have also been vigorously promoted. Some sheep flocks have achieved two births a year, with multiple lambs in one litter, and many high-yield sheep flocks with a breeding survival rate exceeding 100% have emerged. Up to now, the net livestock increase rate in the prefecture has reached 18.8%, exceeding the national plan and breaking the average net increase level of 10.86% in previous years, winning an unprecedented bumper harvest. To meet the requirements of agricultural and animal husbandry development, prefecture, county, and commune industries and transportation have also greatly developed. Today, a highway network centered on Jiegu, the capital of the autonomous prefecture, has been formed, reaching every county by car, and many people's communes are accessible by car. Many vehicles of the prefecture's transportation company have also created the record of more than 10,000 ton-kilometers of vehicle tons per month in plateau driving. Commerce and health services have also been developed accordingly, with central stores and health centers in every commune and health stations in every brigade. The development of agricultural production has prompted a large number of herders to settle down. More than 200 new residential areas have emerged in the prefecture, and many people have moved into warm houses, ending the nomadic life of living by water and grass for a long time. After the herders settled down, cultural and educational undertakings have been developed accordingly. Schools have been established in settlement points, and collective welfare facilities such as public canteens, homes for the elderly, and nurseries have also been established.

The thorough transformation of production relations and the full play of the superiority of the people's commune, which is large in size and has a high degree of public ownership, are the fundamental guarantees for the high-speed development of agricultural production. In the past, the Yushu area was a feudal society with traces of slavery, and productivity was severely restricted. Although the entire prefecture has good natural conditions and abundant natural resources, they have not been fully utilized and developed. Not only was agricultural development slow, but even the animal husbandry production that people relied on for their livelihood only increased by 3% in good years. In the event of natural disasters, they were unable to resist, and a large number of livestock died. Industry was even a "blank sheet of paper," and everything from grass-cutting sickles to the threads used for daily life was supplied from other places. Transportation relied entirely on yaks and horses. After the decisive victory of the socialist revolution in 1958, the feudal rule was completely overthrown, the feudal tribal separatism was ended, the people's commune was established, and the superstitious ideas and various feudal rules and bad habits such as "reclaiming wasteland is destroying grassland" and "grass mountains are sacred mountains" were broken, opening up broad prospects for the development of productive forces. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of Tibetan people who have been thoroughly liberated politically has been unprecedentedly high, demanding to develop production and improve their lives. The people's commune unifies production planning, reasonably arranges labor, and while developing animal husbandry, extracts a large amount of labor to reclaim a large amount of wasteland, build farmland water conservancy, and vigorously develop grain production, thus achieving an all-round leap forward in the various sectors of the national economy centered on agriculture and animal husbandry. Now, due to the strengthening of Party leadership and adherence to the three-level ownership system based on the production team, the strengthening of business management, the implementation of distribution according to work, and the proper arrangement of people's lives, the people's commune has embarked on a path of increasingly consolidated and sound development, providing a reliable guarantee for achieving sustained leap forward in the future.

Strengthening Party leadership and vigorously launching mass movements are the keys to achieving victory in all undertakings. The socialist construction in the Yushu area can move forward with the pace of the great leap forward of the motherland is the result of resolutely implementing the Party Central Committee's correct policy of taking agriculture as the foundation for developing the national economy and the Provincial Party Committee's "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations." From the Prefectural Party Committee to every grassroots Party organization, the first secretary took the lead and focused on agricultural production. Party organizations at all levels transferred a large number of cadres, going deep into the land reclamation sites and fields, eating, living, laboring, and consulting with the masses, comprehensively helping production teams organize labor, do a good job in production, and arrange the lives of the masses. In various production movements, red flags were widely inserted, pacesetters were established, and labor competitions were extensively and deeply carried out. On-site meetings were held to promote advanced experience, effectively mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of the masses. The broad masses were full of energy. They came up with many ingenious methods, such as implementing water irrigation before reclamation and burning turf before reclamation in land reclamation, and renovating more than 20,000 tools, greatly improving labor efficiency. In vigorously developing agriculture, the policy of combining perennial land reclamation with shock land reclamation, combining mechanical land reclamation with human and animal power land reclamation, and combining land reclamation and farmland construction with water conservancy was also implemented. After the cultivated area was expanded, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture was conscientiously implemented. One mu was reclaimed, one mu was planted, and field management was vigorously grasped, closely combining land reclamation with production, thereby ensuring increased grain production.

The care of the Party and the strong support of fraternal ethnic groups are important reasons for the high-speed development of agricultural production in Yushu. In the process of vigorously developing agriculture, the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee have given us strong support in all aspects. Over the past few years, the higher-level government has transported more than 9 million jin of seeds to us from thousands of miles away, and transferred countless new agricultural tools, including dozens of tractors. Han cadres taught Tibetan herders from hand to hand the complete set of agricultural production technologies from land reclamation and cultivation to sowing, harvesting, and threshing, so that a large number of herders quickly learned agricultural production.

Although agricultural production in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has achieved high-speed development, there is still much arable land waiting to be developed. We, the people in the upper reaches of the rivers, will forge ahead with the ambition to always strive for the top, continue to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, and strive to turn the Yushu area into a land of rice and grain in a short period of time, so that the Tibetan people can live a more incomparably happy life like the people of other fraternal ethnic groups in the country.

    江河源头永远争上游
    中共玉树州委第一书记　沈岭
    玉树藏族自治州今年粮食获得增产，首次实现了粮食自给自足。这是我们坚决贯彻执行党中央关于发展国民经济以农业为基础和中共青海省委提出的在牧业区“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的方针取得的伟大胜利，它为开发和加速玉树地区社会主义建设打下了坚实的物质基础。
    玉树藏族自治州位于青海省的西南部，面积达二十多万平方公里，85％以上的居民为藏族，其余为汉、回、土等民族。1952年2月就正式成立了玉树藏族自治区（1955年改称自治州），是青海省最早建立的民族区域自治政权的地区。这里地处青藏高原的中部，虽然地势平均在海拔四千米左右，但境内江河纵横，湖泊密布，雨量充沛，土质肥沃，特别是在长江上游通天河、澜沧江等沿岸，一般气候温和，宜于开垦种植，在发展农业上有着广阔的前途。据史料记载，玉树地区在五百多年以前就开始经营农业。但是，由于广大群众长期受着封建统治阶级的剥削压迫，生产发展极为缓慢。到解放时，只在玉树、昂欠、称多等县有少量耕地，而且耕作粗糙，粮食亩产量不过七、八十斤，广大贫苦牧民经常依靠莞根、草籽及少许肉食充饥。解放后，为了改善牧民群众的生活，党和人民政府远从千里之外运进大批粮食，并在领导群众发展畜牧业生产的同时，大力提倡开荒造田，发展农业。可是，在没有完成民主改革以前，反动阶级利用各种封建特权，千方百计地进行阻挠破坏，加之当时牧民群众没有组织起来，力量单薄，到1957年底，耕地面积才增加到十五万亩左右。
    为了迅速改变玉树地区面貌，加速社会主义建设，全州人民在各级党组织的领导下，在1958年牧区社会主义大革命取得决定性胜利和实现人民公社化的基础上，认真贯彻执行了党中央和毛主席提出的发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针。经过全党全民两年多的努力，播种面积较解放前增加二十多倍。各族人民在海拔四千米的江河源头种植了小麦、大麦、油菜、甜菜、洋芋等数十种农作物，并获得了丰收。实践证明，玉树地区不仅可以发展农业，而且大有可为。今年，玉树藏族自治州农业生产种得多，管得好。全州人民在获得开荒和春播大捷之后，又乘胜大搞以丰产方为纲，以除草为中心的田间管理，并且千方百计与霜冻、冰雹等自然灾害作斗争，整个玉树草原出现了一片丰收的景象。社员们高兴地唱道：“人民公社力量大，什么困难都不怕；辛勤劳动一年整，今年开放幸福花。”广大群众满怀喜悦地进行秋收打碾，开展满勤优质高工效竞赛，同时进行秋翻、积肥和积极准备冬播，为争取明年的更大丰收而奋战。
    大办农业，大办粮食，对加速玉树地区的社会主义建设具有极其重大的意义。由于大量开垦荒地，大兴农业，使农业分布于全州各地，社社队队都种庄稼，因而改变了过去西部广大地区单一经营畜牧业的状况，创造了发展多种经营的物质基础。“高原上不能发展农业”的迷信已被破除，在海拔高达四千米以上的曲麻莱、扎多等地，不仅种出了庄稼，而且获得丰产，这就大大鼓舞了人们改变自然的斗志。由于社社队队种庄稼，保证了人有粮畜有草，逐步改变了畜牧业单纯依靠自然放牧的方式，有力地促进了畜牧业的发展。今年，草原上各类牲畜膘肥体壮，母畜受胎率高，仔畜成活率高。许多羊一胎产双羔、三羔，牛一胎双犊，并大力推行了人工催情和热胎配种等新技术；有些羊群实现了一年两产，一胎多羔，出现了许多繁殖成活率超过100％的高额丰产羊群。到目前为止，全州牲畜净增率达到18.8％，超额完成了国家计划，打破了历年平均净增10.86％的水平，夺得了空前未有的大丰收。适应农牧业发展的要求，州、县、公社工业和交通运输事业也有了很大发展。如今，以自治州首府结古为中心的公路网已经形成，达到县县通汽车，并有很多人民公社通汽车，州运输公司不少单车还创造了高原行车车吨月产万吨公里以上的多拉快跑纪录。商业、卫生事业也得到相应发展，做到了社社有中心商店和卫生所，大队有保健站。农业生产的发展，促使大批牧民定居下来，全州出现了二百多个新的居民点，很多人住上了温暖的房屋，结束了长期以来逐水草而居的游牧生活。牧民定居后，文化教育事业得到了相应的发展。定居点上普遍建立了学校，公共食堂、敬老院、托儿所等集体福利设施也先后建立起来了。
    生产关系的彻底变革，充分发挥人民公社一大二公的优越性，是高速度发展农业生产的根本保证。过去，玉树地区是一个还带着奴隶制色彩的封建社会，生产力受到严重的束缚。尽管全州有着良好的自然条件和丰富的天然资源，但得不到充分的利用和开发。不仅农业发展缓慢，就是人们赖以为生的畜牧业生产，好年成也不过净增3％；一遇自然灾害，则无力抵抗，牲畜大量死亡。工业方面更是一张“白纸”，从割草用的镰刀到生活用的一针一线都靠外地供给。交通运输全靠牦牛、马等。1958年社会主义革命取得决定性胜利之后，彻底推翻了封建统治，结束了封建部落割据状态，成立了人民公社，破除了“开荒是破坏草原”、
  “草山是神山”等迷信思想和各种封建陈规陋习，为生产力的发展开辟了广阔的道路。政治上彻底翻了身的广大藏族人民的生产积极性空前高涨，要求发展生产，改善生活。人民公社统一规划生产，合理安排劳力，在发展畜牧业的同时，抽出大批劳力大量开荒造田，兴修农田水利，大办粮食，因而取得了以农牧业为中心的国民经济各部门的全面跃进。现在，由于加强了党的领导和坚持了以生产队为基础的三级所有制，加强了经营管理，实行了按劳分配，妥善安排人民生活，人民公社已经走上了日益巩固和健全发展的道路，为实现今后的持续跃进提供了可靠的保证。
    加强党的领导，大搞群众运动是一切事业取得胜利的关键。玉树地区的社会主义建设能随着祖国大跃进的步伐阔步向前，是坚决贯彻执行党中央关于发展国民经济以农业为基础和省委提出的“以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营”的正确方针的结果。从州委到每个基层党组织，都是第一书记挂帅，大抓农业生产。各级党组织抽调了大批干部，深入开荒现场、深入田间地头，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，全面帮助生产队组织劳力，搞好生产和安排好群众生活。在各项生产运动中，大插红旗，广树标兵，深入广泛地开展劳动竞赛，并召开现场会议，推广先进经验，有效地调动了群众的劳动积极性。广大群众干劲十足，他们想出了许多巧干的办法，如开荒中实行先浇水后开荒，先烧草皮后开荒等办法，并且革新工具二万多件，大大提高了劳动效率。在大办农业中，还实行了常年开荒与突击开荒并举、机械开荒与人畜力开荒并举、开荒造田与兴修水利相结合的方针；在耕地面积扩大以后，又认真贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，开一亩，种一亩，狠抓田间管理，把开荒与生产紧密地结合起来，因而保证了粮食增产。
    党的关怀和兄弟民族的大力支援，是玉树农业生产获得高速度发展的重要原因。我们在大办农业的过程中，中央和省委在各方面都给予我们以大力支援。几年来，上级政府从千里之外给我们运来九百多万斤种子，调来了包括几十台拖拉机在内的数以万件计的新式农具，汉族干部更是手把手地教藏族牧民从开荒造田、耕耘耙耱到下种、收割打碾一整套农业生产技术，使大批牧民迅速学会了农业生产。
    玉树藏族自治州农业生产尽管获得了高速度的发展，但还有许多可垦地等待着开发。我们地处江河上游的人民将以永争上游的雄心，乘胜前进，继续大办农业、大办粮食，争取在不长的时间内，把玉树地区变成米粮川，使藏族人民同全国其他兄弟民族人民一样，过着更加无比幸福的生活。
