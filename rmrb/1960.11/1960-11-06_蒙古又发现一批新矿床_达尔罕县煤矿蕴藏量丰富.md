Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, November 5th: According to a report by the Mongolian News Agency, the Mongolian People's Republic has discovered a batch of new mineral deposits.

According to preliminary exploration results, rich deposits of high-quality coal have been discovered in Darkhan County, with reserves three times larger than those of the Nalaikh coal mining area, the current main coal-producing region of Mongolia. Abundant iron ore and large deposits of dolomite, the main raw material for cement, have also been discovered in Darkhan.

Oil has been discovered in Choibalsan Province and South Gobi Province, and iron ore has been found in many places in East Gobi Province, Middle Gobi Province, Balenger Province, and Back Khangai Province. In addition, deposits of tin, antimony, silver, zinc, gold, as well as graphite, mirabilite, and crystal stone have also been found.

The Mongolian People's Republic is vigorously conducting geological exploration work in the central and northern regions and along railways. The Geological Exploration Bureau has organized an exploration team to travel by plane to various regions to study reports of mineral finds by local residents. The Geological Exploration Bureau is currently drawing up a geological map covering 52% of the country's territory.

State allocations for geological exploration work are constantly increasing, and the state budget for this area this year has increased by 45.4% compared to 1957.

    蒙古又发现一批新矿床
    达尔罕县煤矿蕴藏量丰富
    新华社乌兰巴托5日电　据蒙古通讯社报道，蒙古人民共和国发现了一批新的矿藏。
    据初步勘探结果，在达尔罕县发现了蕴藏丰富的优质煤的矿藏，其蕴藏量比目前蒙古的主要产煤区那莱哈煤区的蕴藏量还要大三倍。在达尔罕还发现了丰富的铁矿和水泥的主要原料白云石的大量矿藏。
    在乔巴山省和南戈壁省发现了石油，在东戈壁省、中戈壁省、巴楞格省和后杭爱省的许多地方找到了铁矿。此外，还发现了锡、锑、银、锌、金，以及石墨、芒硝和晶石等矿藏。
    蒙古人民共和国正在中部和北部地区以及铁路沿线大力进行地质勘探工作。地质勘探局组织了一个勘探队，乘飞机到各个地区去研究当地居民报矿的情况。地质勘探局最近正在绘制一幅包括全国52％的领土的地质图。
    国家对地质勘探工作的拨款不断增加，今年国家预算中用于这方面的拨款比1957年增加了45.4％。
