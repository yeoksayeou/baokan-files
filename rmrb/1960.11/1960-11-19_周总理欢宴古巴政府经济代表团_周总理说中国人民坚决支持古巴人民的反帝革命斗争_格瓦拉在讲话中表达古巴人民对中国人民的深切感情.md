Xinhua News Agency, November 18th. Premier Zhou Enlai held a banquet in the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People tonight to warmly welcome the representatives of the heroic Cuban people - Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, and all the distinguished guests of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation led by him.

At 7 o'clock, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Li Xiannian, accompanied Major Guevara and members of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation: Hector Rodriguez Llompart, Administrative Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Major Alberto Mora, General Manager of the Cuban Foreign Trade Bank; Major Eddie Suñol Ricart; and other distinguished guests, into the banquet hall together. At the beginning of the banquet, the orchestra played the "July 26th" Cuban Revolutionary March.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests who brought the profound friendship of the revolutionary Cuban people, and expressed his heartfelt gratitude and high respect to the heroic Cuban people and the Cuban Revolutionary Government.

Premier Zhou praised the Cuban people, under the leadership of the Cuban Revolutionary Government and its leader, Premier Fidel Castro, for waging a tit-for-tat struggle against the most ferocious US imperialism close at hand, and for achieving significant achievements in all aspects. Premier Zhou said that the Chinese people are particularly admired for the indomitable and fearless spirit shown by the Cuban people in their struggle.

Premier Zhou said that the struggle and victory of the Cuban people have become the hope and example for the people of Latin America. He pointed out: The struggle of the Cuban people shows that once the oppressed people awaken, as long as they can correctly assess the enemy strategically and skillfully grasp the struggle against the enemy tactically, they will become stronger from weak, and they will surely be able to seize victory and consolidate victory.

Premier Zhou pointed out that US imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Cuban people. The Cuban people and the Latin American people have friends all over the world. The Chinese people have resolutely supported, are resolutely supporting, and will resolutely support the Cuban people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle.

Premier Zhou strongly condemned the Eisenhower government for openly deciding yesterday to send naval and air force units to help the reactionary dictatorial governments of Guatemala and Nicaragua, interfere in the internal affairs of these countries, prepare to suppress the local national democratic movements, and attempt to further threaten Cuba with armed force. He said that all this can only further arouse the common hatred of the Cuban people and the Latin American people.

Speaking of the surging revolutionary situation in Latin America, Premier Zhou said: US imperialism, which has done all kinds of bad things in Latin America, has created thousands of gravediggers for itself. The doomsday of US imperialism in Latin America is getting closer and closer. The closer imperialism and all reactionaries are to death, the more they will struggle. Premier Zhou pointed out that now, the Cuban people's fighting spirit is even more high-spirited. 200 million Latin American people are launching a high tide of struggle against US imperialist intervention in Cuba and aggression against Latin America.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke about the Chinese people now victoriously advancing under the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. He said that the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and the achievements of construction have been achieved in the process of constantly overcoming difficulties, and also in the process of constantly fighting against the US imperialist policy of aggression and war. The Chinese people have never bowed their heads to difficulties, and have never harbored any illusions about imperialism.

Premier Zhou Enlai finally emphasized that as long as the Cuban people and the Latin American people are closely united and persevere in a long-term struggle, all the conspiracies and activities of intervention and aggression by US imperialism will be defeated, and the final victory of the Latin American national democratic revolution cannot be stopped by any force.

When Major Guevara rose to speak at the banquet, the whole audience responded with a long applause. He first expressed the Cuban people's deep gratitude to the Chinese people, saying that this gratitude is difficult to describe in words.

Major Guevara said that we have always maintained this gratitude, because the Chinese people have given us great experience with their twenty-two years of struggle, and the worker-peasant alliance in China under backward rural conditions similar to those in our American countries has pointed out a new path for the Americas. He said that under the obvious danger of aggression from the United States, the Chinese people have risen up to fight to defend our freedom, standing in the ranks of defending our newborn revolutionary pioneer country.

Speaking of the friendship between the Cuban and Chinese people, Major Guevara said that the friendship, understanding, respect, and admiration that our people have for the Chinese people today has developed over many years of long and difficult work, because in those years imperialist propaganda blocked the source of news and blinded the people of our American countries. He said, however, no matter how eloquent the imperialists are, they cannot conceal the fact that when we faced aggression, the socialist countries extended a hand of friendship to us, giving us what was necessary to maintain our economy and the guarantees necessary to defend our country in the event of imperialist aggression.

Major Guevara finally once again enthusiastically said that they have brought the Cuban people's deep respect and admiration for the Chinese people this time.

Premier Zhou and Major Guevara's speeches were greeted with warm applause. After their speeches, the orchestra played the national anthems of Cuba and China respectively.

Vice Premier Chen Yi proposed a toast at the dinner. He proposed a toat to the health of all the distinguished guests of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation headed Major Guevara, to the health of friends from Latin American countries and other countries present, and to the health of the heads of missions of all countries stationed in China.

Also present at the banquet were Guo Moruo and Lin Feng, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, Zhang Hanfu and Geng Biao, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Shen Jian, Chinese Ambassador to Cuba, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, heads of various departments of state organs, people's organizations, democratic parties, and Beijing Municipality, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in the capital.

A reception was held before the banquet, and people from all walks of life in China met with Major Guevara and other distinguished guests.

Heads of missions of various countries to China, foreign guests and students from Latin American countries in Beijing were also invited to attend the banquet. (Attached photo)

    周总理说中国人民坚决支持古巴人民的反帝革命斗争
    格瓦拉在讲话中表达古巴人民对中国人民的深切感情
    新华社18日讯　周恩来总理今晚在人民大会堂宴会厅举行宴会，热烈欢迎英雄的古巴人民的代表——古巴国家银行行长埃尔内斯托·切·格瓦拉少校和由他率领的古巴革命政府经济代表团全体贵宾。
    周恩来总理，陈毅、李先念副总理等，在七时陪同格瓦拉少校和古巴革命政府经济代表团团员：外交部行政副部长艾克托·罗德里格斯·略姆帕尔特，古巴外贸银行总经理阿尔贝托·莫拉少校，埃迪·苏纽尔·里卡尔特少校等贵宾，一起进入宴会厅。宴会开始时，乐队高奏“7月26日”古巴革命进行曲。
    周恩来总理在讲话开始时，向带来了革命的古巴人民深情厚谊的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎，并且向英雄的古巴人民和古巴革命政府表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    周总理赞扬古巴人民在古巴革命政府及其领袖菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理领导下，对近在咫尺的最凶恶的美帝国主义，进行针锋相对的斗争，并在各个方面取得了重大成就。周总理说，中国人民对古巴人民在斗争中表现出的坚强不屈的大无畏精神，特别感到钦佩。
    周总理说，古巴人民的斗争和胜利，已经成为拉丁美洲人民的希望和榜样。他指出：古巴人民的斗争表明，被压迫的人民一旦觉醒起来，只要在战略上能够正确地估计敌人，而在策略上能够善于掌握对敌斗争，他们就会由弱变强，就一定能够夺取胜利，巩固胜利。
    周总理指出：美帝国主义是中国人民和古巴人民的共同敌人。古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民的朋友遍天下。中国人民过去、现在和将来都坚决支持古巴人民的反帝革命斗争。
    周总理强烈地谴责说，艾森豪威尔政府昨天竟公然决定派遣海军和空军部队帮助危地马拉和尼加拉瓜的反动独裁政府，干涉这些国家的内政，准备镇压当地的民族民主运动，并且企图进一步对古巴实行武装威胁。他说，这一切只能进一步激起古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民的同仇敌忾。
    在讲到拉丁美洲高涨的革命形势时，周总理说：在拉丁美洲作尽了坏事的美帝国主义为自己制造了千千万万的掘墓人。美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的末日是越来越临近了。帝国主义和一切反动派越是临近死亡，它们越要进行挣扎。周总理指出，现在，古巴人民的斗志更加昂扬。两亿拉丁美洲人民正在掀起一个反对美帝国主义干涉古巴和侵略拉丁美洲的斗争的高潮。
    周恩来总理讲到中国人民现在正高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗胜利前进。他说，中国人民的革命斗争的胜利和建设事业的成就，是在不断地克服困难的过程中取得的，同时也是在同美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策不断地进行斗争的过程中取得的。中国人民从来不向困难低头，从来不对帝国主义抱有任何幻想。
    周恩来总理最后强调说，只要古巴人民和拉丁美洲人民紧密地团结一致，坚持不懈地进行长期斗争，美帝国主义一切干涉和侵略的阴谋活动都是要失败的，拉丁美洲民族民主革命的最后胜利是任何力量都不能阻挡的。
    格瓦拉少校在宴会上起立讲话时，全场报以长时间的掌声。他首先表示古巴人民对中国人民怀着深切的感激心情，他说，这种感激心情是语言难以形容的。
    格瓦拉少校说，我们一直保持着这种感激心情，因为中国人民以他们二十二年的斗争给了我们伟大的经验，中国在类似我们美洲各国的落后的农村条件下的工农联盟，给我们指出了美洲的新道路。他说，在美国明显的侵略危险下，中国人民起来为保卫我们的自由而斗争，站在保卫我们新生的革命的先锋国家的行列。
    在谈到古巴人民和中国人民的友谊时，格瓦拉少校说，我国人民今天对中国人民的友情、了解、尊敬和钦佩，是多年来长期而困难地发展起来的。因为在那些年里帝国主义的宣传封锁了消息来源，蒙蔽我们美洲各国人民。他说，然而，不管帝国主义如何花言巧语，但他们却不能掩盖这样的事实，当我们面临被侵略的时候，社会主义国家向我们伸出了友谊之手，给予我们维持我们的经济所必要的东西和在帝国主义发动侵略的情况下维护我们的国家所必要的保证。
    格瓦拉少校最后再一次热情地说，他们这次来中国带来了古巴人民对中国人民深切的敬意和敬佩。
    周总理和格瓦拉少校的讲话受到了一阵阵热烈的鼓掌欢迎。他们讲话以后，乐队分别高奏古巴和中国的国歌。
    陈毅副总理在宴会上祝酒。他提议为以格瓦拉少校为首的古巴革命政府经济代表团全体贵宾的健康，为在座的来自拉丁美洲国家和其他国家的朋友们的健康，为各国驻中国使节们的健康，干杯。
    出席宴会的，还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、林枫，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中，对外贸易部部长叶季壮，外交部副部长章汉夫、耿飚，中国驻古巴大使申健，中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南，国家机关各部门、各人民团体、各民主党派和北京市的负责人，中国人民解放军高级将领，以及首都各方面的人士。
    宴会前举行了欢迎酒会，中国各方面人士同格瓦拉少校等贵宾进行了会见。
    各国驻中国的使节，在北京的拉丁美洲国家的外宾和留学生，也应邀出席了宴会。（附图片）
