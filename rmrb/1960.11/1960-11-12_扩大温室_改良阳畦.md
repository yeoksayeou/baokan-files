In Our Commune

　　Expand Greenhouses, Improve Sunken Seedbeds
　　Our Yuyuantan Commune, based on the principle of using local materials and making the best of crude resources, is actively building greenhouses and sunken seedbeds to develop winter vegetable production.

　　Our commune originally had 608 greenhouses and 3,900 sunken seedbeds, with 650 improved sunken seedbeds. This year, in the vigorous movement to develop winter vegetable production, the commune's Party committee mobilized the masses to come up with many ways to build greenhouses and improve sunken seedbeds. For example, lacking sorghum stalks for building greenhouses, castor stalks were used instead. The canopies of more than 900 improved sunken seedbeds in the Luodaozhuang Production Brigade were all made of castor stalks and branches. There have also been significant improvements in the methods of building greenhouses. All of the commune's greenhouses have been changed from 11 feet wide to 14 feet 5 inches wide, so that each greenhouse can plant 40 more tomato plants or 18 more cucumber plants. At the same time, wooden boards have been placed between the two pillars in the greenhouse, which can hold ten flower pots and allow for the planting of ten more winter melon plants. Recently, the commune's greenhouse vegetable planting professional team has been building walls, erecting canopies, and strengthening the management of vegetables that have already emerged from the soil in greenhouses and sunken seedbeds.

    扩大温室　改良阳畦
    我们玉渊潭公社本着就地取材、因陋就简的原则，积极建设温室、阳畦，发展冬季蔬菜生产。
    我们公社原有温室六百零八间，阳畦三千九百个，改良阳畦六百五十间。今年，在大力发展冬菜生产的运动中，公社党委发动群众想出了很多建设温室和改良阳畦的办法，如盖温室缺乏秫秸，就用蓖麻杆代替，罗道庄生产大队的九百多间改良阳畦的顶棚，都是用蓖麻杆和树枝搭成的。在修建温室的方法上，也有很大的改进，公社的全部温室都由一丈一尺宽改为一丈四尺五寸宽，这样，每间温室就可以多栽四十棵西红柿或十八棵黄瓜，同时，在温室的两根立柱之间搭上了木板，可以放十个花盆，增种十棵冬瓜。最近，公社的温室种菜专业队，正在打墙、搭顶棚和加强对温室、阳畦里已出土的蔬菜的管理。
