Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: The Chinese-African People's Friendship Association held a banquet at the Overseas Chinese Hotel tonight to bid farewell to the Algerian Art Troupe, headed by Afa Abdul Madi, representative of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria Art Troupe, and Benlas Bu'alang, the head of the troupe.

Tonight, the banquet hall was filled with a fraternal and warm atmosphere. Artists from China and Algeria gathered together to talk about the militant friendship between the two peoples. The guests repeatedly raised their glasses to the continuous development of cultural friendship between China and Algeria, to the fighting friendship and solidarity between the peoples of China and Algeria, to the friendly unity of the Asian and African peoples, and to the continuous brilliant victories of the Algerian people in their national liberation struggle.

Bao Erhan, Vice President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, spoke at the banquet. He said that today is the seventh anniversary of the Algerian people's national independence war. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, to extend our cordial greetings and highest respect to the heroic Algerian people.

Bao Erhan said that your visit and performance in our country has brought the beautiful Algerian national art, the immortal images of the heroic Algerian national heroes, and the sincere friendship of the Algerian people to the Chinese people, which will always remain in the hearts of the Chinese people. And please ask the friends of the art troupe to bring the sincere friendship of the Chinese people to the heroic Algerian people.

Bao Erhan said that the close friendship established between the Chinese and Algerian peoples in the common struggle against imperialism and colonialism has developed rapidly in recent years. This visit by the Algerian Art Troupe has opened a new page in cultural exchanges between China and Algeria.

Bao Erhan finally said that the Chinese people are always concerned about the struggle of the incomparably heroic Algerian people who are standing on the front line against imperialism. We firmly believe that the Algerian people, who have grown and strengthened in the flames of war, will persist in their struggle with the support of the people of all countries in the world, and will surely completely and thoroughly liberate their sacred homeland and achieve the final victory of the national liberation struggle.

Afa Abdul Madi, the representative of the Art Troupe sent by the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, said in his speech that we spent a wonderful time during our visit and performance in China, especially today - November 1st, this day of solemn significance. We are very touched by the warm reception and love of the Chinese people. Through us ordinary people, the Algerian people will feel that you have added to their glory.

Afa Abdul Madi said that we have enriched ourselves during our visit to China. We believe that you understand us and we understand you, we are friends. 650 million Chinese people have expressed friendship to 12 million Algerian people. In tomorrow's world, the relationship between people will no longer be the relationship between wolves and people. In tomorrow's world, both large and small countries have the right to enjoy the same happy life and be respected.

Among those present at the banquet were Zhang Tiesheng, Vice President of the Chinese-African People's Friendship Association, He Ying, Director of the West Asia and Africa Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and well-known figures from the capital's literary and art circles and literary and art workers from the armed forces, including Ouyang Yuqian, Li Wei, Chen Qitong, Hua Junwu, Hu Guogang, Sun Shen, Wu Xue and Ding Li, etc.
