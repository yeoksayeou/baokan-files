　　Cadres arrive at our village,
　　Autumn harvest is in full swing,
　　Autumn planting hasn't started yet,
　　Right in the middle of the busiest time,
　　Cadres arrive at our village.
　　Work hard during the day,
　　Chat about family matters at night.
　　Weeds and pests are wiped out,
　　Seedlings are thriving and strong;
　　Sweet potatoes are well managed,
　　They can be both food and dishes.
　　Radish production is great,
　　Each mu yields a thousand catties of grain;
　　Use it as a side dish,
　　Both sweet and nutritious.
　　Life is well arranged,
　　Production morale is high;
　　With grain and vegetables,
　　Life can be strong;
　　The canteen is well managed,
　　The commune members are delighted.
　　Comrades,
　　Your methods are truly great,
　　Take the lead in production,
　　Vowing to seize a bumper grain harvest.
　　　　Liu Jingzhai

    干部到俺庄秋收正大忙，秋耕未种上，正在百忙处，干部到俺庄。白天搞生产，夜晚论家常。草、虫齐灭净，苗儿旺又壮；地瓜管理好，饭菜都能当。萝卜产量大，亩顶千斤粮；把它作副食，又甜又营养。生活安排好，生产干劲长；有粮又有菜，生活才能强；食堂管理好，社员喜洋洋。各位同志们，办法真是强，生产带头干，誓夺粮超产。
