Xinhua News Agency, New York: While politicians from the two major American bourgeois parties make deceptive and empty promises about civil rights during elections, they simultaneously intensify their brutal suppression of millions of Black people fighting for basic human rights and political rights.

	Thugs Run Rampant and Go Unpunished
	Black People Beaten and Arrested
	To demand an end to racial discrimination, the Black sit-in demonstrations that began in the spring of this year and are still ongoing in the southern states of the United States have been subjected to provocation and persecution from various sides by the American ruling class and white racists. At the end of October, in Jackson, Tennessee, a series of incidents occurred over three consecutive days in which large numbers of white racists attacked a small number of Black people participating in sit-in demonstrations. On October 30, eleven Black people entered a restaurant that had previously been for whites only and requested service. At this time, more than two hundred white racists surrounded the restaurant, throwing eggs at the Black people and shouting abuse. When the police arrived, instead of stopping the racist thugs, they arrested all eleven Black people on charges of "disrupting order."

	With the connivance and support of the American ruling class, the activities of the notorious "Ku Klux Klan," an extreme racist organization in the United States, are becoming increasingly rampant. Racist Senator Herman Talmadge openly clamored that another era requiring the active involvement of the "Ku Klux Klan" has arrived. In the southern states of the United States where Black people are holding demonstrations against racial discrimination, "Ku Klux Klan" members are carrying out their evil activities.

	Electoral Rights Are Just Empty Words
	Actual Voting Is Not Easy
	The American ruling class also widely deprives Black people of their basic political rights and intensifies the suppression of Black people's struggle for these rights. In any general election in American history, the number of voters has never reached 63% of the total electorate. In the southern United States, only one-tenth of Black people have the right to vote, and in some areas, Black people have never enjoyed the right to vote to this day. According to materials revealed in the American "Congressional Record," in eleven states in the southern United States, there are one hundred and fifty-eight districts where Black people account for more than half of the residents. In these areas, less than 5% of the total number of Black people are registered as voters. In fourteen districts of Mississippi, not a single one of the fifty-two thousand Black people of voting age is registered as a voter. In the Gadsden precinct of Florida, only seven out of every ten thousand eligible Black people are registered as voters. Such facts are common in the southern United States and have always been the case. Nineteen states stipulate that voters must have a certain level of "education." White officials at voter registration offices deprive Black people of their voting rights through various so-called "literacy" tests and "constitutional" quizzes. For example, in Georgia, even the state legislators who set the fifty "intelligence test" questions deliberately designed to stump Black people cannot answer them all correctly. Florida even requires Black people to be able to answer how many windows there are in the White House before they have the right to vote. Black people who insist on exercising their voting rights are often subjected to economic persecution, beaten, or even massacred.

	In Louisiana, the legislature recently canceled the social relief benefits of six thousand Black families to threaten Black people not to participate in the movement demanding "equal educational rights and voting rights." Two Black pastors in Florida were sentenced to six months in prison and fined one thousand two hundred dollars respectively for refusing to hand over the membership list of the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to the American authorities. Black leader King, a leader of the American anti-racial discrimination movement, and thirty-five Black people were arrested by the authorities in Atlanta, Georgia, on October 19.

	Lessons of Blood and Tears Brighten Eyes
	Must Resolutely Carry Out the Struggle
	Countless lessons of blood and tears have made more and more American Black people no longer deceived by the American government and bourgeois politicians, and realize the truth that they must rely on mobilizing and organizing the masses to fight against the reactionaries. Black leader King, who was arrested by the American authorities, said at a mass rally in Los Angeles not long ago, "We have patiently hoped that Washington (the authorities) would uphold our constitutional rights, but we have found only a conspiracy of indifference and hypocrisy." He emphasized, "Now we have had to take the struggle into our own hands." Robert Williams, chairman of the North Carolina Federation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, also pointed out, "The deep roots of racial discrimination are in the social and economic structure of the United States. To eliminate racial discrimination, the entire capitalist system must be changed."

    政客为了骗取选票侈谈“平等”黑人争取基本权利备受凌辱
    美国法西斯暴徒肆意迫害黑人
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级两党的政客们在竞选中一方面就公民权利问题作出欺世惑众的空洞许诺，另一方面却对千百万争取基本人权和政治权利的黑人加紧残暴镇压。
    暴徒逞凶逍遥法外
      黑人挨打又遭逮捕
    为了要求取消种族歧视，从今年春天开始，到目前仍然在美国南部各州进行中的黑人静坐示威运动，受到美国统治集团和白人种族主义分子多方的挑衅和迫害。10月底，在田纳西州的杰克逊城，接连三天发生了为数众多的白人种族主义分子，袭击少数参加静坐示威的黑人的事件。10月30日，十一个黑人进入一家过去专供白人用餐的餐馆，要求供给用餐。这时候，两百多白人种族主义分子即包围起餐馆，向这些黑人投掷鸡蛋并高声叫骂。警察赶来，不仅不制止种族主义分子的暴行，反而以“破坏秩序”为罪名，把十一个黑人全都逮捕起来。
    在美国统治集团的纵容和支持下，美国极端的种族主义组织臭名昭著的“三K党”的活动正日益猖獗。种族主义分子、参议员赫尔曼·戴梅治公开叫嚷说，另一个需要“三K党”积极进行活动的年代已经到来。在有黑人举行反对种族歧视示威的美国南部各州，都有“三K党”徒在进行罪恶活动。
    选举权利徒有虚名
      实际投票谈何容易
    美国统治集团还广泛剥夺黑人的基本政治权利并且加紧镇压黑人争取这些权利的斗争。美国有史以来任何一次大选，投票人数从未达到选民总数的63％。而在美国南部，只有十分之一的黑人有选举权，有些地区黑人甚至迄今从未享到过选举权。据美国“国会纪录”透露的材料：在美国南部十一个州有一百五十八个区，黑人占居民半数以上，在这些地区，列入选民名单的黑人还不到黑人总数5％。密士失必州十四个区五万二千个达到投票年龄的黑人中，没有一个列入选民名单。在佛罗里达州的伽斯登选区，每一万个适龄黑人只有七人被列入选民名单。这样的事实在美国南部是屡见不鲜，而且是从来如此。有十九个州规定选民必须具有一定“教育程度”。选民登记处的白人官员以各种所谓“识字”考试、“宪法”测验剥夺黑人选举权。例如：佐治亚州规定的五十个故意刁难黑人的“智力测验”题，连出题目的州议员也答不全。佛罗里达州甚至要黑人能回答出白宫有多少窗户以后才有权投票。坚持运用自己选举权的黑人还往往受到经济上的迫害，被毒打或甚至被屠杀。
    在路易斯安那州，立法机关最近取消了六千个黑人家庭的社会救济金以威胁黑人不要参加要求“平等的教育权和投票权”的运动。佛罗里达州的两个黑人牧师由于不肯把全国有色人种协进会地方分会的会员名单交给美国当局，而分别被判半年徒刑和一千二百美元罚金。美国反对种族歧视运动的黑人领袖金牧师和三十五个黑人10月19日被佐治亚州亚特兰大市当局逮捕。
    血泪教训擦亮眼睛
      必须坚决进行斗争
    无数血泪的教训使越来越多的美国黑人不再受美国政府和资产阶级政客的欺骗，认识到必须倚靠发动组织群众同反动派进行斗争的真理。被美国当局逮捕的黑人领袖金牧师不久前在洛杉矶的一次群众集会上说，“我们曾经耐心地指望华盛顿（当局）维护我们的宪法权利，但是我们发觉有的只是一个漠视和伪善的阴谋”。他强调说，“现在我们已不得不把斗争掌握在自己手中”。美国全国有色人种协进会北卡罗米纳州联合会主席罗伯特·威廉斯也曾经指出，“种族歧视的深根是在美国的社会和经济结构当中。要消灭种族歧视，必须改变整个资本主义制度。”
