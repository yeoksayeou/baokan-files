    Shouting at the Front Line
    Chen Qi

    December 20, 1948

    Early in the morning, the fighting stopped. The Huaihai Plain, covered in a light fog and white snow, appeared strangely still. Let the heavily besieged enemy catch their breath and listen to our shouts; this is also a kind of attack—an attack without guns and cannons.

    Carrying a megaphone and propaganda leaflets, I followed instructor Lu Jun along the communication trench to the position of the second platoon of the eighth company at the front. This place was only twenty-odd meters away from the enemy's碉堡(Diāobǎo, pillbox/blockhouse). Standing at the sentry post, you could clearly see the two dark gun holes on the pillbox inside the barricades, diagonally facing us. We could also hear loud noises from over there.

    After the first few shouts, the pillbox opposite us was quiet, as if stunned. Then we heard a commotion, mixed with intermittent scolding: "Damn it, shoot, shoot... I'll have you shot..."

    A few bullets flew over our heads, and hand grenades exploded on the accumulated soil in the communication trench. Obviously, they weren't shooting very energetically. Ignoring them, we continued to shout in the pungent smell of gunpowder: "KMT soldiers, don't shoot! The People's Liberation Army is not your enemy. Think about it, who dragged you into the army? Who forced you to shoot? He is your real enemy..."

    This time, after five or six minutes, they responded with two sparse gunshots.

    "Lay down your weapons and we are all one family. Don't risk your lives for the reactionaries and traitors..."

    We stubbornly shouted until the other side made no sound at all. At this time, instructor Lu ordered the 60mm mortar team to fire propaganda shells. We watched the propaganda shells swaying in the air, exploding behind the enemy's pillbox, and a cloud of paper pieces flew like snowflakes onto the enemy's fortifications, trenches, and fields.

        December 21

    After breakfast, reporter Fang from the army newspaper and I, carrying large banners and propaganda leaflets, went to the front line again.

    As soon as we shouted a few times, we were immediately met with fierce machine-gun fire. Dust flew around the observation hole, indicating that the enemy was retaliating against us in a prepared manner. Instructor Lu quickly ran over and told us to keep a lower profile. Then he raised the megaphone and shouted at the enemy's pillbox: "KMT soldiers, who ordered you to shoot just now? Please write down his name. After we break in, we will severely punish him. Those who command you to shoot at us and stubbornly resist to the end will only meet death..."

    This time it worked. We listened for a long time, and the pillbox opposite was silent. Until the afternoon, the enemy did not shoot at us again. We shouted to our heart's content, explaining the current situation of the enemy and us, the entire situation of the Huaihai Campaign, what is the way out, and what is the dead end, all very clearly. We especially warned the enemy that breaking out is wishful thinking, and the Sun Yuanliang's troops who attempted to break out and were annihilated by us are their example.

    We estimated that the enemy was obediently listening to our shouts. So, at night, we put the large red cloth banners we brought in front of the enemy's defensive works. "Only surrender is the way to survive," a line of prominent characters directly faced the enemy. This work went very smoothly, without any trouble.

          December 22

    According to battlefield reports, KMT soldiers are surrendering on all fronts. Of course, we also want to win such victories. We promptly broadcast these surrender news to the enemy soldiers and exposed all kinds of deceptive propaganda by the enemy.

    Instructor Lu said that because of the continuous heavy snow, the enemy could not airdrop supplies, and the enemy troops in the encirclement had run out of food. They were dividing horse meat and digging up the green wheat roots of the common people to fill their hunger. We decided to send food to the enemy.

    At noon, old Cui, the cook from the battalion headquarters, brought two large buckets of rice. I first used the megaphone to notify the enemy: "We know you have been hungry for several days. Now, we have specially prepared food for you. Don't shoot when we send it over, do you hear?"

    There was another commotion in the pillbox, obviously they were excited. I repeated the shout, urging them to reply. Before long, we heard shouts from the pillbox: "Send it over, we won't shoot."

    Old Cui was very happy when he heard this. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with his scarf and picked up two full buckets of rice, stepped out of the communication trench, and walked towards the small village fifty meters behind the pillbox. To prevent accidents and ensure Old Cui's safety, the instructor ordered the machine gun to be set up, ready to provide cover at any time.

    We watched Old Cui approach the small village and stop at the side of a broken wall. Immediately, a group of KMT soldiers rushed out of the communication trench and bunkers, swarming up, and the crowd swallowed Old Cui's figure. About ten minutes later, we saw Old Cui running back empty-handed, busy saying before we could ask: "Those guys are really starving! Dozens of people were grabbing for two buckets of rice, using big bowls, ladles, and tin cans, all kinds of utensils. The bowls were crushed, so they used their hats to scoop it, their hands full of rice, and the buckets were also crushed..."

            December 23

    At dawn, the eighth company's signalman brought over a surrendered KMT soldier, a squad leader from the 22nd Division of the enemy's Eighth Army. This hungry soldier was devouring noodles like crazy. After our shouting for several days, he had eliminated his fear. Speaking with a Hubei accent, he told us that three of them came over together at night, and when they crossed the barricades, a burst of bullets suddenly came from behind. They ran for their lives, and he didn't know where the other two had run to. We asked him if he had heard our shouts. He repeatedly replied: "I heard them, I heard them very clearly. An officer was sent from our regimental headquarters, telling us not to listen to the shouts, saying that the communists were spreading rumors and that reinforcements were coming. But who believes him? There are many people who want to run over now, but the superiors are watching too closely..."

    At daybreak, we found a KMT soldier lying on the open ground ten meters in front of the eighth company's position, curling up his feet, looking like he wasn't dead yet. The soldiers quietly threw steamed buns near him, but he never reached out to take them. When it got dark, squad leader from the fourth squad of the eighth company jumped out of the communication trench with a soldier and quietly groped towards where the enemy soldier was lying. As they were carrying the wounded soldier back, the enemy started shooting, and a bullet grazed the fourth squad leader's leg, fortunately without injury. Finally, they safely carried him back.

    In the second platoon's shelter, our medical staff gave the dying KMT soldier an emergency injection and bandaged his wound. The KMT squad leader who surrendered at dawn also came, recognizing him as his fellow villager, who was injured when they ran together last night. As soon as his fellow villager woke up, he said with tears in his eyes:
  "Brother, if it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, you wouldn't have this life today!"

    That night, we planned to send the two of them to the regimental headquarters. But the KMT squad leader insisted on staying. He said he wanted to do his part for the People's Liberation Army. The next day, he joined our shouting team. In the cold air, his trembling Hubei accent rang out: "Brothers, come over quickly! The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are our real saviors... I am the squad leader from the 22nd Division of the Eighth Army..."

    火线喊话
    陈奇
    1948年12月20日
    清晨，战斗停下来了，薄雾和白雪复蔽着的淮海平原，现出奇异的静谧。让被重重围困的敌人喘息一下，听听我们喊话吧，这同样是一种进攻——一种不用枪炮的进攻。
    我拿着喇叭筒和宣传弹，随同教导员陆骏同志沿交通沟来到前沿八连二排的阵地。这儿距敌人的碉堡只有二十多米，站在监视哨的哨位上，可以清楚地看到鹿砦里面碉堡上两个黑黑的枪眼，斜对着我们。那边大的响动也可以听得到。
    开头几声喊话后，对面碉堡里静悄悄的，想是怔住了，跟着就听得一阵骚动，夹杂着断续的斥责声：“妈的，打，打……枪毙你们……”
    几颗子弹从我们头顶掠过，手榴弹也在交通沟的积土上炸裂了。显然打的并不起劲。我们不理它，在刺鼻的火药味中继续喊下去：“蒋军弟兄们，不要打枪了，解放军不是你们的敌人，想想吧，谁抓你们当兵？谁逼着你们打枪？他才是你们真正的敌人……。”
    这回，隔了五六分钟，才回答我们两发稀落的枪声。
    “放下武器就是一家人，不要为反动派卖国贼卖命了……。”
    我们执拗地一直喊到对方没一点儿声息。这时，陆教导员命令六零炮手把宣传弹打出去。我们了望着宣传弹在空中摇晃着，在敌人碉堡后面炸裂了，一团纸片雪花似地飞落在敌人的工事、堑壕和田野里。
        12月21日
    吃过早饭，我和部队报社方记者一起带着大幅标语、宣传弹，又到了前沿阵地。
    当我们喊了几声以后，立刻招来猛烈的机枪扫射，尘土在了望孔的四周飞扬起来，看来敌人是在有准备地报复我们。陆教导员迅速地跑过来，要我们姿式低一些，接着他举起喇叭筒，对准敌人的碉堡喊：“蒋军弟兄们，刚才谁命令你们打枪？请把他的名字记下来，等我们打进去后，一定要严厉惩办他。指挥向我们打枪，顽固到底的，只有死路一条……。”
    这一下奏了效，我们倾听了好久，对面碉堡里鸦雀无声。直到下午，敌人再也没有向我们打过枪，我们喊了个痛快；把目前敌我形势，淮海战场的整个情况，什么是出路，什么是死路，都讲得明明白白。我们特别警告敌人，突围是妄想，企图突围被我们消灭的孙元良部就是他们的榜样。
    估计敌人是规规矩矩听我们喊话了。于是夜里我们把带来的大幅红布标语，插到敌人的防御工事前面，“只有投诚才是生路”，一行显赫的大字直对着敌人。这个工作进行得很顺利，没遇到任何麻烦。
          12月22日
    根据战场通报，各线都有蒋军投诚。我们当然也要争取这样的战绩，我们把这些投诚的消息都及时地向敌人士兵广播了，并揭破了敌人种种欺骗宣传。
    陆教导员说，因连日大雪，敌人无法空投，包围圈里的敌军已经断粮食，在分食马肉，挖老百姓的青麦根充饥。我们决定送饭给敌人。
    中午，营部炊事员老崔挑来两大桶大米饭。我先用喇叭筒通知敌人：“我们知道你们已经饿了几天，现在，特地为你们作好了饭，送过去的时候，不要打枪，听到了吗？”
    碉堡里又是一阵骚动，显然是兴奋起来了。我又重复地喊问，催他们答复。不多时，只听到碉堡里一片喊声：“送来吧，我们不打。”
    老崔一听可高兴了，一边使围巾抹着额角上的汗珠，一边挑起满满两大桶米饭，跨出交通沟，朝碉堡侧后五十米那个小村走去。教导员为了预防意外，保障老崔安全，命令架起机枪，准备随时掩护。
    我们目送着老崔走近小村，在一垛断墙边停下了。立刻，一群蒋军士兵从交通沟、地堡里冲出来，一拥而上，人群吞没了老崔的身影。约莫十多分钟以后，只见老崔空着手跑了回来，没等问就忙着说：“那些家伙们真饿得凶哩，几十个人抢着两桶饭，拿大碗的，拿瓢的，拿罐头筒的，什么家什都有，碗挤碎了就使帽子去掏，满手满手都是饭，桶也给挤烂了……。”
            12月23日
    拂晓，八连通信员送来一个投诚过来的蒋军士兵，是敌第八军二十二师的一个下士副班长。这个饿急了的士兵见着面疙瘩没命地吞食着，几天来经过我们喊话，他已经消除了恐惧心理，操着湖北口音告诉我们说，他们夜里一起过来三个人，当越过鹿砦的时候，突然从背后打来一梭子子弹，他们拼命地跑，那两个不知跑到什么地方去了。问他是否听到过我们喊话。他连声答：听到，听得清清楚楚，我们那里从团部派来一个军官，叫我们不要听喊话，说是共产党造谣，援兵就要到了。可是谁相信他，这会儿想跑过来的可多哩，就是上边看管得紧……。
    天明了，我们发现八连阵地前面十多米的开阔地上躺着一个蒋军士兵，蜷曲着脚，看样子还没死。战士们悄悄地朝他身边抛掷馒头，却始终不见他伸手拿。等到天一黑下来，八连四班副便带着一个战士跳出交通沟，悄悄向敌军士兵躺着的地方摸去。他们在抬着这个伤兵向回走时，敌人打起枪来，子弹擦过四班副的腿，幸好没伤着，终于安全地抬回来了。
    在二排的掩蔽部里，我们的医务人员给这个奄奄一息的敌军士兵打了救急针，包扎好伤口。那个拂晓投诚过来的蒋军下士副班长也来了，他认出是自己的同乡，昨晚一起跑的时候被打伤的。等那个同乡刚醒转过来，他就眼泪汪汪地说：
  “老哥，不是八路军你哪有今天这条命呵！”
    当晚，我们打算把他俩送到团部去。可是那个下士副班长坚决要求留下来。他说要为解放军出一分力。第二天，他参加了我们的喊话组。在寒冷的空气中响彻着他那带着颤抖的湖北腔：“弟兄们，快快过来吧，共产党解放军是我们真正的救命恩人……。我是八军二十二师的下士副班长……。”〔中国人民解放军三十年征文稿〕
