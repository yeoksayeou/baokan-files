This newspaper from Tianjin, November 15th reports: In this era of the Great Leap Forward, heroes are emerging in an endless stream, and songs of praise echo everywhere. The more than one thousand commune members of the Fourth Management District of Nandagang Commune in Huanghua County, Hebei Province, are among these heroes. They conquered wastelands and vigorously developed grain production, planting 28,000 mu of rice this year, with an average grain production of more than 10,000 jin per laborer.

The Fourth Management District of Nandagang Commune is located east of the Bohai Sea and has more than 70,000 mu of land. Before liberation, this was a saline-alkali wasteland. The entire depression was uninhabited, except for a village of about one hundred households in the northwest corner, called Si'nian. Farmers relied on gathering grass and fishing for a living year-round, without planting even half a mu of crops. In 1957, the Party and the government mobilized more than 10,000 laborers, working hard through the winter and spring, to build the Nandagang Reservoir, providing a water source for reclaiming this wasteland.

At the beginning of 1958, the Huanghua County Party Committee issued the call to "March into the wasteland, seize grain from the depression!" More than a thousand heroes stepped forward and formed a land reclamation army, setting up camp in this age-old wasteland. With the spirit of "regarding ten thousand rivers and a thousand mountains as nothing," and with the perseverance of cutting through thorns and brambles, they overcame numerous difficulties. After a year of hard work, they planted more than 4,000 mu of rice, allowing the wasteland to produce grain for the first time. In 1959, the commune members advanced victoriously, expanding the rice area to 14,000 mu, producing more than 4.3 million jin of rice, changing the historical lack of grain, and selling more than 2 million jin of surplus grain to the state for the first time.

At the beginning of this year, the Party General Branch of the Fourth Management District, based on summarizing the successful experience of the two years of the Great Leap Forward, further mobilized the masses, established ambitious goals, and decided to double the rice planting area again.

In order to realize this grand plan, all the commune members started a upsurge of land reclamation and water conservancy construction right after the Spring Festival. The water conservancy army organized by the management district braved the severe cold and opened a drainage canal more than twenty li long, draining the accumulated water in the fields into the Bohai Sea. Then, they began to build field water conservancy projects. After two months of hard work, they newly reclaimed more than 10,000 mu of wasteland.

In the water conservancy construction, they truly lacked everything. In the case of a shortage of various materials, the commune members adhered to the principle of self-reliance, making what they could make themselves, and using substitutes where possible, solving the problems one by one.

The arduous water conservancy project had just ended when the rice transplanting season followed closely.

How to plant all the land became everyone's biggest concern. The whole district has one thousand and sixty-two laborers. Apart from the logistics personnel and those leveling the land, only three or four hundred people can directly participate in rice transplanting. Relying on these laborers, it would take at least three months to complete the transplanting plan of 28,000 mu. How could this be possible?

In the face of large tasks, tight schedules and a labor shortage, the Party General Branch of the management district summarized the planting experience of previous years and decided to adopt a method that combines transplanting as the main method with dry and wet direct seeding. Zhang Zhibu, the Party General Branch Secretary with rich experience in rice planting, calculated the land, manpower and time day and night, repeatedly discussing with cadres and commune members, and finally made a clever arrangement: In March, use machines for dry direct seeding on 9,000 mu; then, in the later stage of seedling raising, use water to sow another five or six thousand mu; the remaining more than 10,000 mu will be concentrated with all forces to rush transplanting. After the transplanting is completed, the commune members can free up their hands to rush to weed the weeds in the dry and wet direct seeding fields and strengthen field management. This will not only ensure that all land is planted in a timely manner, but also manage the seedling fields well; it can both give play to the role of machines and fully exert the power of commune members.

Scientific arrangements strengthened the masses' confidence in victory. All the cadres and commune members, regardless of wind and rain, and not afraid of hardship, fought fiercely for two months and completed the sowing task in a timely manner.

Weeds grew while the commune members were busy transplanting rice. In particular, weeds were serious in the more than 10,000 mu of dry and wet direct seeding fields. After the commune members finished transplanting, they immediately launched a struggle against the weeds. All the men, women, and children of the entire management district went into battle, loudly putting forward the slogan of "Seizing grain from the weeds," and fighting in the fields all day long.

After defeating the weeds, insect pests suddenly struck. More than 20,000 mu of rice suffered from varying degrees of "rice stem borer." All commune members put forward the slogan of "Seizing grain from the mouths of insects" and launched a battle against insect pests. Dozens of sprayers went into battle together, and in a few days, the insect pests were defeated again.

After defeating weeds and insect pests, a more ferocious enemy came to this Bohai beach—the tide.

One day in early autumn, an easterly wind of force six or seven blew over the Bohai Sea, with monstrous waves, and it rained heavily, with the entire depression shrouded in a vast rain curtain. Zhang Zhibu, the Party General Branch Secretary, grew up on the coast of the Bohai Sea and has been planting rice for many years, so he knows the threat of saltwater to rice. He quickly notified each production team by phone to step up defense. The cadres and commune members of each team held iron shovels, braved the wind and rain, and rushed to the embankment to dig soil, transport grass, reinforce and heighten the embankment.

At night, the sea wind howled, the rain poured down, the flood water flowed down, and the sea water pushed up, and the canal water surged. Suddenly, there was a breach in the levee of the twenty-eighth team. Wang Jixian, the Party Branch Secretary of this production team, jumped into the water without hesitation and blocked the breach with his body. Commune members Yang Changyu, Shi Jinhai and others also jumped down. The three of them held each other's arms tightly and persisted for more than an hour. Commune members fought continuously day and night for five days and five nights, and finally defeated the several rare tides in recent years.

Of the 28,000 mu of rice in the entire management district, with the exception of some losses due to various disasters, 24,000 mu have achieved a good harvest.

    征服荒滩　大办粮食
    南大港公社第四管理区每个劳力平均生产稻谷万斤
    本报天津15日电　在这大跃进的年代里，真是英雄层出不穷，赞歌到处荡漾。河北省黄骅县南大港公社第四管理区的一千多个社员，正是这些英雄中的英雄。他们征服荒滩，大办粮食，今年种植了两万八千亩水稻，平均每个劳动力生产稻谷一万斤以上。
    南大港公社第四管理区东临渤海，共有土地七万多亩。解放以前，这里是一片盐碱荒滩。整个大洼没有人烟，只是西北角二十余里的地方，有一个百户人家的村庄——四埝。农民们终年依靠打草、治鱼生活，没种半亩庄稼。1957年，党和政府发动万余民工，大干一冬一春，修建了南大港水库，给开垦这片荒滩准备了水源。
    1958年初，中共黄骅县委发出了“向荒地进军，向洼地夺粮”的号召，千余英雄挺身而出，组成开荒大军，在这千年的荒滩安营下寨。他们以“万水千山只等闲”的气概，以披荆斩棘坚韧不拔的毅力，克服了重重困难。经过一年的奋战，种植了四千多亩水稻，让荒滩第一次生产出了粮食。1959年，社员们乘胜前进，使水稻面积扩大到一万四千亩，产稻谷四百三十多万斤，改变了有史以来的缺粮面貌，第一次卖给国家余粮二百余万斤。
    今年年初，第四管理区党总支在总结两年大跃进胜利经验的基础上，进一步发动群众，树立雄心大志，决定把水稻种植面积再翻一番。
    全体社员为实现这个雄伟的计划，春节刚过就开始了开荒和兴修水利热潮。管理区组织的水利大军，冒着严寒，开拓了一条二十多里长的排水渠，将田间积水排入渤海。接着，又开始修建田间水利工程。经过两个月的奋战，又新开了一万多亩荒地。
    在水利建设中，真是要什么没有什么。社员们在各种物资缺少的情况下，坚持了自力更生的原则，能自制的自制，能代用的代用，问题一个一个地都解决了。
    艰巨的水利工程刚刚结束，插秧季节紧接着来到了。
    如何全部种上，这是大家最关心的问题。全区共有一千零六十二名劳动力，除了后勤人员和平整土地的以外，能够直接参加插秧的不过三四百人。依靠这些劳力，要完成两万八千亩的插秧计划，最快也得三个月。这怎么能行呢？
    在这任务大、时间紧、劳力不足的情况下，管理区党总支总结了往年的种植经验，决定采取以插秧为主，旱、水直播齐用的方法。富有种植水稻经验的党总支书记张芝馥，日日夜夜地屈指核算着土地、人员、时间，反复地和干部、社员们商量，结果作出了巧妙的安排：3月份，用机器旱直播九千亩；然后，在育秧的后期，再水点种五六千亩；剩下一万多亩集中全部力量，突击插秧。当插秧结束以后，社员们就可以腾出手脚突击拔除旱、水直播地里的杂草，加强田间管理。这样，既可以保证全部土地适时播种，又可以把秧田管理好；既能发挥机器的作用，又能充分发挥社员的力量。
    科学的安排，坚定了群众的胜利信心。全体干部社员不顾风雨，不畏艰苦，激战了两个来月，全部适时地完成了播种任务。
    野草，趁社员们忙着插秧的时候，生长起来了。特别是旱、水直播的一万多亩田地里，草荒严重。社员们结束了插秧，立即又向草荒开展了斗争。全管理区的男女老幼一齐上阵，响亮地提出“向草荒夺粮”的口号，终日在田野里奋战。
    战胜了草荒，虫害又突然袭来。二万多亩水稻，程度不同地发生了“稻苞虫”。全体社员提出“虫口夺粮”的口号，又向虫害展开战斗。几十架喷雾器一齐上阵，几天的工夫，虫害又被战胜了。
    战胜了草荒、虫害，在这渤海滩上，又来了一个更凶恶的劲敌——海潮。
    秋初的一天，渤海海面刮起了六七级的东风，海浪滔天，又下起大雨，整个大洼笼罩在茫茫雨幕中。党总支书记张芝馥，从小生长在渤海沿岸，种稻多年，深知咸水对水稻的威胁。他急忙用电话通知各个生产队加紧防守。各队的干部、社员持着铁锨、冒着风雨、奔向堤岸，挖土、运草，加固、加高堤埝。
    夜，海风呼啸，大雨倾盆，洪水下泄，海水顶托，渠水猛涨。忽然，在二十八队的堤坝上，有一处决口了。这个生产队的党支部书记王吉贤奋不顾身地跳进水里，用身子堵住决口。社员杨长玉、史金海等也一跃而下。他们三人紧挽着臂，坚持一个多小时。社员们日日夜夜连续战斗了五天五夜，终于战胜了近几年少有的几次海潮。
    全管理区的二万八千亩水稻除因为各种灾害，一部分受损失外，有二万四千亩获得了良好的收成。
