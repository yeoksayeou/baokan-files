Perseverance in struggle will surely lead to final victory. The Algerian people, through six years of national liberation war, have laid a solid foundation for defeating French imperialism and achieving independence and freedom. Today, on the glorious occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian people's armed uprising, the Chinese people extend warm fighting greetings to the heroic Algerian people!

The national liberation struggle waged by the Algerian people is an important development in the contemporary colonial revolutionary movement. Its significance and influence extend far beyond the borders of one country. This struggle has not only greatly encouraged the national democratic movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, becoming a shining banner for all oppressed people striving for liberation, but has also made increasingly significant contributions to the global struggle against imperialism and for the defense of world peace. Today, the Chinese people enthusiastically respond to the call of Algerian people's organizations and the call of the International Trade Union Committee for Support of Algerian Workers and People, which recently met in Cuba, to hold a "Day of Support for Algeria." We are holding a "Day of Support for Algeria" rally in Beijing, once again expressing the deep sympathy and resolute support of the 650 million Chinese people for the great Algerian people who are struggling for the noble cause of national liberation.

The national liberation war waged by the Algerian people is progressive and just. Algeria has suffered from the enslavement of French imperialism for 130 years. French colonialists have committed all kinds of evil deeds on Algerian soil, viciously destroying Algerian civilization and culture, seizing more than half of its total arable land, and wantonly plundering its rich resources. The blood and sweat of the Algerian people have fattened the French bloodsuckers, while they themselves groan in a sea of misery, unable to eat their fill, without warm clothes, without any rights or life security. However, brutal national oppression cannot conquer the Algerian people. For more than a century, their flames of struggle for independence and freedom have never been extinguished. As Lenin pointed out: "National wars against the imperialist powers are not only possible and conceivable but also inevitable, progressive and revolutionary." The oppression of French colonialism finally made the Algerian people unable to endure it any longer, and on November 1, 1954, they took up arms and launched a nationwide armed uprising. A just and progressive national war thus began. Their struggle has won the sympathy and assistance of the people of the world. The Chinese people, the entire socialist camp, the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and even the revolutionary people in Western countries, all stand on the side of the Algerian people. Justice gains abundant support; the justice and progressiveness of the Algerian national liberation war are the decisive factors for its inevitable victory.

Conversely, the colonial war waged by French imperialism to maintain its colonial rule and continue to enslave and plunder the Algerian people is reactionary and unjust. This dirty war has not only been opposed by the people of all countries in the world but has also been met with increasingly strong opposition from the broad masses of the French people. On October 27, the French people held a "National Day of Action" to oppose the Algerian colonial war. Protest demonstrations were held in major cities such as Marseille and Lyon, and workers, staff, and technicians in many enterprises held lightning strikes to express their protest. The de Gaulle government has been placed in a very isolated situation. Losing support, France's shameful colonial war will eventually fail.

The Algerian people face difficulties in their war for independence and freedom. Their military and economic strength is temporarily inferior to that of French imperialism. French imperialism is also extremely brutal. In the past six years of war, bandits have massively destroyed villages, devastated women, children, and the elderly, massacred one million Algerian people, forced two million people to become displaced, and implemented a strict blockade against the Algerian liberated areas. However, awakened and united people can endure all difficulties and overcome all difficulties. The strength of the Algerian people is gradually growing and expanding in battle and in the struggle against difficulties. They have developed from a force of only 3,000 people with spears and old rifles into a strong armed force of over 100,000 regular troops and guerrillas, resisting more than 800,000 French elite troops, having already eliminated over 100,000 French colonial troops, liberated half of the entire territory, and established a provisional government. A liberation war supported by the entire population has unlimited potential. We have always believed that what determines the victory or defeat of a war is not the powerful and superior technology and equipment of imperialism, but the morale of the people, the spirit of the people.

The Algerian colonial war waged by French imperialism is a completely hopeless war. The vast majority of France's land forces, 60% of its air force, and 90% of its navy are trapped in the quagmire of the Algerian colonial war, unable to extricate themselves. This cannot but greatly weaken France's strength and international position. The bottomless war expenses have created serious financial difficulties for France. The budget expenditure for 1961, recently passed by the French parliament, reached an unprecedentedly large figure of over 62.8 billion francs. The de Gaulle government, unable to win through a cruel colonial war, is trying to resort to the "peace" trick, putting forward deceptive proposals such as granting Algeria the so-called "right to self-determination" and "ceasefire negotiations." However, the essence of this so-called "peace" has long been repeatedly exposed by de Gaulle himself. He refused to give any guarantee to the Algerian people's "right to self-determination," and even in the Melun negotiations, he refused to give the representatives of the Algerian provisional government equal status. All this further proves that imperialism will never automatically withdraw from the colonies. Without a serious struggle, imperialists will never deal with the people of the colonies on an equal footing. As Premier Abbas said, "While seeking negotiations and giving all opportunities for peace, we must strengthen our means of combat and armed struggle. Independence is not to be obtained easily; it must be won." De Gaulle's "bringing out the kind of self-determination that France has conceived is clearly only a means and technique to 'paralyze' and deceive international public opinion, which never understands the truth." Premier Abbas further pointed out in an interview with Xinhua reporters on October 30 that "France only wants negotiations limited to a ceasefire, and the ceasefire that France wants is essentially a surrender. The French government is attempting to negotiate with us in the posture of a victor over the defeated; therefore, we have no common language, and these negotiations can never take place, because the Algerian people will never accept surrender negotiations." The Chinese people completely agree with Premier Abbas's views and support the Algerian people's persistence in resistance and their determination not to lay down their arms, while not excluding the struggle for national independence through negotiations on an equal footing.

At present, the development of the world situation is increasingly favorable to the Algerian people's struggle. The unprecedented strength of the socialist camp, the unprecedented upsurge of national democratic movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and the growing strength of all peace-loving people in the world; these forces united together far outweigh the strength of imperialism. The strength of the Algerian people, viewed locally, may still be temporarily inferior, but from a global perspective, they are already in an advantageous position. The wheel of history is crushing the colonial system, and the twilight years of imperialism will not last long. This is a favorable condition for the Algerian people to persevere in struggle and strive for victory.

Of course, on the road to victory, there will inevitably be arduous struggles. The Algerian people not only face barbaric French imperialism but also encounter the ferocious neo-colonialist—US imperialism. The Algerian people are clearly aware that if the French colonialists did not have the support of the North Atlantic group headed by the United States, they would have been unable to continue fighting in Algeria long ago. According to incomplete statistics, US imperialism provided France with a total of 4.5 billion US dollars in military "aid" from 1950 to 1960. Currently, 75% of the weapons used by the French colonial army on the Algerian battlefield come from the United States and NATO. Not only that, it has recently been discovered that US military personnel, under the guise of technicians, are directly stationed at the Boufarik and Bone airports in Algeria; US reconnaissance planes are also taking photographs and collecting intelligence over Algerian territory and areas controlled by the Algerian National Liberation Army. Algeria has become one of the main targets of US imperialist aggression. US imperialism is playing various conspiracies to take France's place in Algeria. Facts show that US imperialism is the main accomplice of the French colonialists in massacring the Algerian people and is the most ferocious and dangerous enemy of the Algerian people today. However, no matter French imperialism or US imperialism, all their conspiracies will inevitably be met with failure after failure in the face of an awakened people.

The Chinese people have undergone more than 100 years of fierce struggle against imperialism, continuous failures, and continuous struggles before achieving the great victory of the people's revolution. In the long struggle, the Chinese people have encountered unimaginable difficulties and endured tremendous pain and sacrifices, but no difficulty has overwhelmed us. We have relied on the strength of the people, the unity of the people, persevered in struggle, and overcome all difficulties. Precisely because the Chinese people have had these arduous experiences, they have the deepest understanding of the current struggle and situation of the Algerian people, and therefore have the greatest sympathy and heartfelt admiration for them. We firmly believe that the heroic and tenacious Algerian people cannot be overwhelmed by any enemy or difficulty. The Chinese people assure the Algerian people that we will do everything possible to give the Algerian people the greatest support and assistance until they achieve final victory.

The Algerian people, holding high the banner of national liberation, are invincible! Six years of history have proven this, and future history will continue to prove this. Victory will surely belong to the Algerian people who persevere in struggle.

### 坚持斗争，就是胜利

    坚持斗争，就是胜利
    坚持斗争，就一定能够赢得最后胜利。阿尔及利亚人民坚持了六年的民族解放战争，已经为打败法帝国主义，争取独立和自由，奠定了必胜的基础。今天是阿尔及利亚人民发动武装起义六周年的光荣日子，中国人民谨向英雄的阿尔及利亚人民，致以热烈的战斗敬礼！
    阿尔及利亚人民所进行的民族解放斗争，是当代殖民地革命运动的一个重要发展。它的意义和影响，已经远远地超出了一国的范围。这个斗争，不仅大大鼓舞了非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的民族民主运动，成为一切被压迫人民争取解放的一面光辉旗帜，而且也对全世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的斗争，作出了越来越大的贡献。今天，中国人民热烈地响应阿尔及利亚人民团体的呼吁，和最近在古巴召开的国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会会议关于举行“支援阿尔及利亚日”的号召，在北京举行首都各界人民“支援阿尔及利亚日”大会，再一次表达六亿五千万中国人民对于正在为民族解放的崇高事业而斗争的伟大的阿尔及利亚人民的深切同情和坚决支持。
    阿尔及利亚人民进行的民族解放战争，是进步的，正义的。阿尔及利亚遭受法帝国主义的奴役，已及一百三十年。法国殖民主义者在阿尔及利亚的土地上，干尽了坏事，恶毒地破坏了阿尔及利亚的文明和文化，霸占了它的全部可耕地的一半以上，恣意掠夺着那里丰富的资源。阿尔及利亚人民的血汗，喂肥了法国吸血虫，而他们自己却呻吟在吃不饱、穿不暖、没有任何权利和生活保障的苦海之中。但是，残暴的民族压迫，征服不了阿尔及利亚人民。一百多年来，他们争取独立和自由的火焰，从来没有熄灭过。正像列宁所指出的：“反对帝国主义列强的民族战争不仅是可能的和可以设想的，而且是不可避免的、进步的、革命的。”法国殖民主义的压迫，终于使阿尔及利亚人民忍无可忍，在1954年11月1日拿起了武器，举行全民的武装起义。一场正义的和进步的民族战争，从此开始了。他们的斗争，获得了全世界人民的同情和援助。中国人民、整个社会主义阵营、整个非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲的人民，以至西方国家中的革命人民，都是站在阿尔及利亚人民一边的。得道多助，阿尔及利亚民族解放战争的正义性和进步性，是必胜的决定性因素。
    相反的，法帝国主义为了维护它的殖民统治，继续奴役和掠夺阿尔及利亚人民进行的殖民战争，是反动的，非正义的。这种肮脏的战争，不仅遭到全世界各国人民的反对，并且遭到了广大法国人民越来越强烈的反对。10月27日，法国人民举行了“全国行动日”，反对阿尔及利亚殖民战争。马赛、里昂等主要城市，都举行了抗议示威，许多企业中的工人、职员和技术人员纷纷举行表示抗议的闪电罢工。戴高乐政府已经陷入十分孤立的处境。失道寡助，法国这一可耻的殖民战争必将最后失败。
    阿尔及利亚人民，在争取独立和自由的战争中，是有困难的。他们的军事力量和经济力量，比起法帝国主义来，暂时还处于劣势的地位。法帝国主义又是十分残暴的，过去六年战争中，盗匪们大规模毁灭村庄，摧残妇女、儿童和老人，屠杀了一百万阿尔及利亚人民，迫使二百万人流离失所，还对阿尔及利亚解放区实行了严密的封锁。但是，觉醒了的、团结起来的人民，是能忍受一切困难，克服一切困难的。阿尔及利亚人民的力量，在战斗中，在同困难进行的斗争中，逐步成长和壮大起来。他们从只有长矛、破旧枪枝的三千人的队伍，发展成为拥有十几万正规军和游击队的坚强武装力量，抗击着八十万以上的法国精锐部队，已经消灭了十几万法国殖民军，解放了全部国土的一半，成立了临时政府。得到全民支持的解放战争，是具有无限潜力的。我们从来认为，决定战争胜败的，不是帝国主义强大的优良的技术装备，而是民心士气，是人民。
    法帝国主义进行的阿尔及利亚殖民战争，是一场完全没有指望的战争。法国的绝大部分陆军、60％的空军和90％的海军都陷在阿尔及利亚殖民战争的泥淖，不能自拔。这就不能不大大削弱法国的力量和国际地位。无底的战争费用，造成了法国财政上的严重困难。最近法国议会通过的1961年的预算支出，达到六百二十八亿多法郎空前庞大的数字。戴高乐政府在用残酷的殖民战争不能取胜的情况下，妄想乞灵于“和平”的一手，提出骗人的所谓给予阿尔及利亚“自决权”、“停战谈判”等等。可是，这种所谓“和平”的实质，早经戴高乐自己所一再揭穿。他拒绝给予阿尔及利亚人民的“自决权”以任何保证，甚至在默伦谈判中，拒绝给予阿尔及利亚临时政府的代表以平等的地位。这一切，进一步证明了，帝国主义是绝对不会自动退出殖民地的。不经过严重的斗争，帝国主义者也是绝不会同殖民地人民平等打交道的。阿巴斯总理说得好：“在寻求谈判和给予和平一切机会的同时，我们必须加强我们的战斗手段和武装斗争。独立不是垂手可得的，它必须是赢得的。”而戴高乐“搬出法国所设想的那种自决来，显然只是一种用以‘麻痹’和欺骗始终不了解真相的国际舆论的手段和手法。”阿巴斯总理在10月30日接见新华社记者时更进一步指出，“法国所要的谈判只限于停火，而法国所要的停火实质是一种投降。法国政府企图以战胜者对战败者的姿态来同我们进行谈判，因而我们之间没有共同语言，这种谈判永远不可能进行，因为阿尔及利亚人民永远不会接受投降的谈判。”中国人民完全赞同阿巴斯总理的这些看法，支持阿尔及利亚人民坚持抗战、决不放下武器，同时，不排除在平等的基础上，通过谈判，争取民族独立的斗争。
    目前，世界形势的发展，越来越有利于阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。社会主义阵营力量的空前强大，非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲民族民主运动的空前高涨，全世界一切爱好和平的人民的力量日益发展；这些力量联合起来，大大超过了帝国主义的力量。阿尔及利亚人民的力量，从局部看，纵然还暂时处于劣势，但是，从世界的全局看，他们已经处于优势的地位。历史的巨轮正在碾碎殖民主义体系，帝国主义的风烛残年已不会久长了。这是阿尔及利亚人民坚持斗争、争取胜利的有利条件。
    当然，在走向胜利的道路上，必将通过艰巨的斗争。阿尔及利亚人民不仅面临着野蛮的法帝国主义，并且还碰到了凶恶的新殖民主义者——美帝国主义。阿尔及利亚人民清楚地知道，法国殖民主义者如果没有以美国为首的北大西洋集团的支持，早就在阿尔及利亚打不下去了。据不完全统计，美帝国主义从1950年到1960年度，给予法国的军事“援助”共达四十五亿美元之多。目前法国殖民军队在阿尔及利亚战场上使用的武器有75％来自美国和北大西洋公约组织。不仅如此，最近还发现美国军人以技术人员为名，直接驻在阿尔及利亚的布法列克和波尼机场上；美国的侦察机也在阿尔及利亚领土上空和阿尔及利亚民族解放军控制的地区拍摄照片，搜集情报。阿尔及利亚已成为美帝国主义的主要侵略目标之一。美帝国主义正在玩弄种种阴谋，要在阿尔及利亚取法国的地位而代之。事实表明，美帝国主义是法国殖民者屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的主要帮凶，是阿尔及利亚人民当前最凶恶和最危险的敌人。但是，不管法帝国主义也好，美帝国主义也好，他们的一切阴谋，在觉悟了的人民面前，必将遭到一次接一次的失败。
    中国人民身经一百多年的反对帝国主义的激烈斗争，不断的失败，不断的斗争，才取得了人民革命的伟大胜利。在长期的斗争中，中国人民曾经遭到过难以想像的困难，忍受过巨大的痛苦和牺牲，但是，任何困难都没有压倒我们。我们依靠人民的力量，人民的团结，坚持斗争，克服了一切困难。正由于中国人民有着这些艰辛的经历，对于阿尔及利亚人民目前的斗争和处境，体会最深，因而对他们也抱有最大同情和衷心的钦佩。我们深信，英勇顽强的阿尔及利亚人民，是任何敌人和困难所不能压倒的。中国人民向阿尔及利亚人民保证：我们将尽一切可能，给予阿尔及利亚人民以最大的支持和帮助，直到他们取得最后胜利。
    高举民族解放大旗的阿尔及利亚人民，是不可战胜的！六年的历史证明了这一点，今后的历史仍将证明这一点。胜利一定属于坚持斗争的阿尔及利亚人民。
