To allow scientific research to better serve industrial and agricultural production, Jiangsu Province is widely carrying out activities to deliver technology to the doorstep.

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th) Under the leadership of the provincial party committee and party committees at all levels, the science and technology associations at all levels in Jiangsu Province are increasingly and extensively carrying out various forms of technology delivery activities based on the needs of production, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production.

Jiangsu Province's technology delivery activities were created and developed during the mass movement of the whole people running science and engaging in technological innovation and technological revolution. Since the beginning of this year, according to incomplete statistics, provincial-level academic societies, focusing on the central task of increasing grain and steel production, have assisted relevant business departments in organizing more than 40 technical investigations, technical consultations, mobile on-site meetings, and science and technology knowledge lectures, with more than 2,000 people participating. The technology delivery activities in agriculture involved increasing production of wheat, rice, cotton, rapeseed, green manure, vegetables, and live pigs, improving soil, improving the efficiency of pesticides, and cultivating chlorella; in industry, there were activities to improve the lifespan of converters, reduce iron consumption, rapid electric furnace smelting, and technical transformation of small blast furnaces. Each special district, city, and county has also widely carried out technology delivery activities based on current production needs. In the first half of this year alone, the Huaiyin Special District organized 339 technical investigations of various types, with 7,679 people participating in the investigations.

Since the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, Jiangsu Province's technology delivery activities have become more frequent and in-depth. The Provincial Science and Technology Association and the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences jointly organized more than 280 technical personnel from Nanjing Agricultural College, Subei Agricultural College, Nanjing Agricultural College Agricultural Mechanization Branch, Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute, and the Institute of Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to form the Jiangsu Province Autumn Mature Crop Technology Investigation Team. They went to various special districts to conduct on-the-spot investigations by district and category, combining with local technical forces, and summarizing local high-yield experiences. In terms of carrying out artificial control of natural disasters, the Provincial Meteorological Society assisted the Provincial Meteorological Bureau in actively carrying out frost prevention work based on the characteristics of this year's early frost. They compiled and printed technical publicity materials on frost prevention, and organized frost prevention work teams to go to key cotton-producing areas to conduct on-site demonstrations, delivering technology to the doorstep.

Through technology delivery activities, scientific researchers and teachers and students of colleges and universities summarized the advanced experiences and technologies created by the masses in production. On the one hand, this enriched the content of scientific research and promoted scientific research work; on the other hand, it was conducive to the teaching reform of colleges and universities, allowing teachers and students to gain rich experience and materials from production practice, enrich teaching content, and better integrate teaching, scientific research, and production. At the same time, this activity enabled intellectuals to go deeper into production, reality, and the masses, and to unite with workers and peasants. It also promoted close contact and strengthened cooperation among scientific and technical personnel. Teachers participating in agricultural investigations felt they had gained a lot by coming into contact with reality and the peasant masses.

The result of widely carrying out technology delivery activities is that it has also improved the scientific and technological level of the broad masses, cultivated various technical talents, and rapidly strengthened the scientific and technological team. Under the leadership of the municipal party committee and party committees at all levels, the science and technology associations at all levels in Wuxi City widely carried out various scientific and technological research activities, delivering technology to the doorstep, and improving the scientific and technological level of workers, young technicians, and cadres with rich production experience. At present, more than 3,000 mass-based scientific and technological research groups have been established in factories throughout the city. Recently, the Provincial Science and Technology Commission entrusted the Provincial Science and Technology Association to organize scientific and technological forces from relevant departments and colleges and universities to promote and apply linear programming (an important branch of operations research) in transportation. Using mathematical methods to plan and manage transportation, under the original equipment conditions, reasonable planning, tapping potential, saving a lot of manpower, material resources, and financial resources for the country, and enabling the staff and masses to master a new scientific knowledge.

    让科学研究更好地为工农业生产服务
    江苏广泛开展技术送上门活动
    本报南京29日电　江苏省各级科学技术协会在省委和各级党委领导下，根据生产需要，愈益广泛深入地开展各种形式的技术送上门的活动，促进工农业生产的发展。
    江苏省开展技术上门活动是在全民大办科学、大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动中创造发展起来的。今年以来，据不完全统计，省级各学会围绕增产粮、钢的中心，协助有关业务部门组织了技术考察、技术会诊、流动现场会、科学技术知识讲座等各种活动达四十多次，参加人员达二千多人。技术上门活动，在农业方面涉及的有三麦、水稻、棉花、油菜、绿肥、蔬菜、生猪的增产，土壤的改良，农药的效率和小球藻培植等；工业方面有提高转炉炉龄、降低铁耗、电炉快速冶炼、小高炉技术改造等。各专区、市、县根据当前生产需要，也都广泛开展了技术上门活动。仅淮阴专区今年上半年就组织了各种类型的技术考察三百三十九次，参加考察的有七千六百七十九人。
    自开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动以来，江苏省的技术送上门活动更加频繁和更加深入。省科学技术协会又组织中国农业科学院江苏分院，先后组织南京农学院、苏北农学院、南京农学院农业机械化分院、南京农业机械化研究所、中国科学院土壤研究所等单位的技术力量共二百八十多人，成立了江苏省秋熟作物技术考察团，分赴各专区，结合当地的技术力量，分区分类进行实地考察，总结各地丰产经验。在开展人工控制自然灾害工作方面，省气象学会协助省气象局根据今年早霜可能早临的特点，积极开展防霜工作，编印防霜技术宣传资料，组织防霜工作组深入重点产棉区进行现场表演，送技术上门。
    科学研究人员和院校师生，通过技术上门活动，总结群众生产中创造出来的先进经验、先进技术，一方面丰富了科学研究内容，推动科学研究工作，另一方面又有利于院校的教学改革，使师生从生产实践中获得丰富的经验和资料，充实教学内容，使教学、科学研究和生产更好地结合起来。同时，通过这种活动，使知识分子更多地深入生产、深入实际、深入群众，与工农群众结合，还推动科学技术人员之间密切联系，加强协作。参加农业考察工作的教师，由于接触了实际，接触了农民群众，感到收获很大。
    广泛开展技术上门活动的结果，还提高了广大群众的科学技术水平，培养了各种技术人材，迅速壮大了科学技术队伍。无锡市在市委和各级党委领导下，各级科学技术协会广泛开展各种科学技术研究活动，把技术送上门，提高了富有生产经验的工人、青年技术人员、干部的科学技术水平。现在全市各工厂建立了三千多个群众性的科学技术研究小组。最近省科学技术委员会委托省科学技术协会又组织有关部门和院校的科学技术力量，在交通运输方面推广和应用线性规划
  （运筹学的一个重要分支）。以数学方法计划和管理交通运输，在原有设备条件下，合理筹划，挖掘潜力，为国家节约大量人力、物力、财力，并使职工群众又掌握了一项新的科学知识。
