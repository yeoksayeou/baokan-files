(Our newspaper's Shenyang dispatch on the 20th) The Zhanglouzi Production Team of Dadianzi Commune in Tieling County, Liaoning Province, conscientiously implemented the policy of "The whole party and all the people should take action to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production," and fully mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. This year, despite nearly one-third of the cultivated land suffering from reduced production due to floods, the total grain output still reached 1.17 million jin due to the significant increase in yield per unit area on most of the cultivated land. It has become a red banner for vigorously developing grain production in Tieling County and Liaoning Province.

The reason why the Zhanglouzi Production Team achieved a bumper harvest in a disaster year this year is primarily because the team conscientiously implemented the policy of "taking agriculture as the foundation of the national economy." From all aspects such as labor, leading cadres, funds, and land use, it concentrated its main strength to strengthen the grain production front, truly achieving the goal of the whole party and all the people taking action to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. Of the team's 277 male and female laborers, 217 regularly participated in grain production, accounting for 78.3% of the team's total labor force. Among the team's 32 Party and Communist Youth League members, 27 led and participated in grain production; Branch Secretary Fu Yinpu was responsible for leading dryland production, and Team Leader Li Xiangchen was responsible for leading paddy field production. In terms of fund utilization, the needs of grain production were given priority. 93% of the annual production expenditure was used for grain production. In terms of land use, the team planted grain crops on 90% of its cultivated land, of which 80% were high-yield crops. This provided a reliable guarantee for the development of grain production in all aspects.

On the basis of concentrated leadership and concentrated strength, the Zhanglouzi Production Team conscientiously implemented various policies and fully mobilized the production enthusiasm of commune members, which was another important reason for winning a bumper grain harvest.

The Zhanglouzi Production Team has always adhered to the policy of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," and insisted on implementing the system of work assessment and scorekeeping, more pay for more work, and paying wages every two months or every season. This greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of the commune members and ensured the realization of the production plan. For example, this year the team had to transplant all of its 70-plus hectares of paddy fields. The time was short, the task was heavy, and the work was tiring. The team stipulated that each workday for laborers participating in paddy field transplanting would be recorded two work points more than those participating in dryland weeding, based on the different labor intensity and production technology. This greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the laborers participating in paddy field transplanting. More than 30 commune members in the paddy field team competed with each other, transplanting an average of one mu of rice seedlings per person per day, with the highest reaching 1.2 mu, which was more than half as efficient as neighboring teams. As a result, all the transplanting was completed in just 18 days, giving the rice a longer suitable growing period and creating favorable conditions for a bumper rice harvest. In order to allow commune members to have sufficient rest time after intense production labor to recover from fatigue and physical strength, the team stipulated that in addition to ensuring that commune members had eight hours of sleep time every day during the busy farming season, they could also have two hours of free rest time; and resolutely reduced meetings, insisting on not holding or holding fewer meetings in the evenings during the busy farming season. At the same time, they also used the gaps between the spring plowing, summer hoeing, and autumn harvest and other busy agricultural seasons to give the commune members vacations, so that the commune members had sufficient time to arrange housework and rest. Therefore, before the start of this year's autumn harvest, the commune members had prepared everything properly for the winter, and as soon as the autumn harvest arrived, they devoted themselves to the battle for the autumn harvest with all their energy, so this year's autumn harvest was done quickly and well.

Firmly grasping the initiative in agricultural production, comprehensively implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and the policy of combining multiple planting and multiple harvesting with high yield and multiple harvesting played a huge role in ensuring a bumper grain harvest this year despite the disaster situation. In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, the Zhanglouzi Brigade prepared last year. Last autumn, the team plowed a total of 140 hectares of land, an increase of two and a half times compared to 1958; this year, more than 50,000 jin of good fertilizer was applied to each hectare of cultivated land; most of the grain crops were selected from fine varieties. For example, all of the more than 50 hectares of sorghum planted by the team this year were high-yield "253" fine varieties, with an average yield of 7,000 jin per hectare, an increase of 24% compared to the "Da Qingke" sorghum planted last year. In terms of field management, the production rules of "early, tight, meticulous, and ruthless" were grasped. Due to early action, tight action, meticulous arrangements, and ruthless grasping to the end, the farming technology and the ability to overcome natural disasters were greatly improved. For example, they started plowing and planting wheat on March 19 this year, and finished planting on the 28th, 20 days earlier than last year. Immediately following, they started plowing and planting large fields on April 12, and the planting of large fields was done early, quickly, abundantly, and well. The planting area was 12 hectares larger than last year. By the time of rice transplanting, the dry land had generally been hoed for the first time; then they divided into two groups, one to attack the rice transplanting, and the other to fiercely attack the second weeding of the dry land. By June 19, the rice transplanting was all completed, and by the end of July, the dry land had generally completed three hoeings and three tilling, and the paddy fields had generally weeded twice, thereby completely eliminating weeds, ensuring clean land and strong seedlings, and promoting the vigorous growth of autumn grain crops. Therefore, although nearly one-third of the team's cultivated land suffered from disaster and reduced production this year, the team's grain output still achieved a good harvest higher than in bumper years.

### 张楼子生产队为什么灾年仍然夺得好收成？  集中主力增强粮食战线  78％的劳力、93％的生产开支、90％的耕地用于粮食生产

    张楼子生产队为什么灾年仍然夺得好收成？
    集中主力增强粮食战线
    78％的劳力、93％的生产开支、90％的耕地用于粮食生产
    本报沈阳20日电　辽宁省铁岭县大甸子公社张楼子生产队，认真贯彻“全党全民动手，大办农业，大办粮食”的方针和各项政策，充分调动了广大社员的革命干劲，今年全队在将近三分之一的耕地遭受水灾减产的情况下，由于大部耕地单位面积产量显著提高，粮食总产量仍然达到了一百一十七万斤，比大丰收的1959年仍有增产，成为铁岭县和辽宁省大办粮食的一面红旗。
    今年张楼子生产队所以能在灾年获得了丰收，首先是因为这个队认真地贯彻执行了
  “国民经济以农业为基础”的方针，从劳动力、领导骨干、资金和土地的使用等各个方面，集中主要力量加强了粮食生产战线，真正做到了全党全民动手、大办农业、大办粮食。全队二百七十七名男女劳动力，常年参加粮食生产的就有二百一十七名，占全队劳动力总数的78.3％。全队三十二名党、团员，有二十七名领导和参加粮食生产；支部书记傅荫普分工领导旱田生产，大队长李向臣分工领导水田生产。在资金使用上，也尽先保证粮食生产的需要，全年生产开支中，用于粮食生产的占93％。在土地使用上，全队用90％的耕地播种了粮食作物，其中80％是高产作物。这样便为发展粮食生产从各个方面提供了可靠的保证。
    在领导集中、力量集中的基础上，张楼子生产队认真贯彻了各项政策，把社员的生产积极性充分调动起来，这是夺得粮食丰收的另一个重要原因。
    张楼子生产队一直坚持贯彻各尽所能、按劳分配的政策，坚持实行评工记分、多劳多得和每两个月或一季发一次工资的制度，从而大大激发了社员的生产积极性，保证了生产计划的实现。如今年全队七十多公顷水田要全部实行插秧，时间短、任务重、活计累，队里便根据劳动强度和生产技术的不同情况，规定参加水田插秧的劳动力，每个劳动日比参加旱田锄草多记两分工，大大鼓舞了参加水田插秧劳动力的生产积极性，水田队三十多名社员你追我赶，平均每人每天插秧一亩，最高的达一亩二分，比邻队插秧效率高半倍以上；结果只用十八天便全部插秧完毕，给水稻争得了较长时间的适宜生育期，为水稻丰收创造了有利条件。为了让社员在紧张的生产劳动之后，有充分的休息时间，恢复疲劳和体力，在农忙时期，队里规定除了保证社员每天有八小时的睡眠时间外，还可以有两小时自由休息的时间；并且坚决减少会议，坚持在农忙时期晚间不开会或少开会。同时，他们还利用春耕、夏锄、秋收等农业大忙季节中间的空隙时间给社员放假，使社员有充分的时间安排家务和进行休息。因此，在今年秋收开始前，社员们把过冬的事情都已准备妥善，秋收一到便以全副精力投入夺秋大战，因而今年的秋收做到了又快又好。
    紧紧掌握农业生产的主动权，全面贯彻农业“八字宪法”和多种多收与高产多收相结合的方针，对于保证今年在受灾情况下获得粮食丰收发挥了巨大作用。张楼子大队为了争取今年农业大丰收，在去年就做了准备。去年秋天全队共翻地一百四十公顷，比1958年增加了两倍半；今年每公顷耕地施了好肥五万多斤；绝大部分粮食作物都选用了优良品种。如今年全队种植的五十多公顷高粱，全部是“二五三”高产良种，平均每公顷产量达到七千斤，比去年种植的“大青壳”高粱增产24％。在田间管理方面，抓住了“早、紧、细、狠”的生产规律。由于早动手、紧行动、细安排、狠抓到底，大大提高了耕作技术和战胜自然灾害的能力。如今年3月19日他们就开犁种麦，到28日全部种完，比去年提前二十天。紧接着4月12日开犁种大田，大田播种做到了又早又快又多又好，小满前便全部结束了大田播种，播种面积比去年扩大了十二公顷。到水田插秧时，旱田已普遍铲完头遍；接着兵分两路，一路突击水田插秧，一路猛攻旱田二遍锄草，到6月19日全部结束了水田插秧，7月底旱田普遍完成了三铲三趟，水田也普遍拔了两遍草，从而彻底消灭了草荒，保证了地净苗壮，促进了秋粮作物的旺盛生长。因此，今年全队虽然有近三分之一的耕地受灾减产，但是全队的粮食产量仍然获得了高于丰收年景的良好收成。
