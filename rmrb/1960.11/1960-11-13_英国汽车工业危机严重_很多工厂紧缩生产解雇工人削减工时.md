Xinhua News Agency, London, November 11th: The British auto industry is facing its biggest crisis, mainly due to the blow of reduced automobile imports by the United States. Thousands of auto manufacturing workers have already received layoff notices, and many others have had their working hours reduced. Last night, the British Motor Corporation announced in Birmingham that more than half of the company's 60,000 workers would have their working hours reduced starting next week. This brings the total number of auto workers with reduced working hours to 70,000.

A third of the workers at the British Motor Corporation have been working only four days a week for a month. This has resulted in a reduction of 2,000 cars per week. Under this new decision, approximately 17,000 workers who were still working five days a week will now only work four days a week, while the 16,000 workers who were already working only four or three days a week will have another day of work cut. This means that workers' income will be reduced by about £4.

The British Motor Corporation is the third auto company to take measures to reduce working hours in three days. Standard Motor Company has already announced the layoff of 2,000 workers. Vauxhall Motors has already reduced the working hours of 10,000 workers and has now cancelled the night shift. Rootes Motors, Rover factories, and other auto companies have also laid off thousands of workers and reduced working hours.

Some factories related to the auto industry have also been affected. The Oxford steel rolling mill has laid off 2,000 workers because auto companies cannot accept the car bodies manufactured by this factory. The Swindon branch of this factory announced today that it will lay off 1,100 workers, bringing the unemployment rate in Swindon to its highest level since the depression of the early 1930s.

This sharp decline in automobile production powerfully illustrates the serious predicament of the auto industry. The auto industry, which occupies an important position in British exports, has now fallen into the commercial recession of the entire capitalist world, especially the United States, which is one of Britain's main markets for automobiles. According to recent official figures, the average monthly value of goods exported to North America fell by £10 million from the first quarter to the third quarter, of which automobiles accounted for £4 million. At the same time, in the Western European market, British automobile exports are facing fierce competition from West Germany, France, and Italy. In the domestic market, the Conservative Party's policy of credit tightening and restrictions on installment purchases have exacerbated this crisis.

### 英国汽车工业危机严重  很多工厂紧缩生产解雇工人削减工时

    英国汽车工业危机严重
    很多工厂紧缩生产解雇工人削减工时
    据新华社伦敦11日电　英国汽车工业由于主要受到美国减少汽车进口的打击，正面临着最大的危机。数以千计的汽车制造工人已经接到解雇通知，其余的许多人被缩短工时，而昨天晚上英国汽车公司在伯明翰又宣布，从下星期起，这家公司的六万名工人中有一半以上要削减工时。这就使得被削减工时的汽车工人总数达到七万人。
    英国汽车公司有三分之一的工人每周只工作四天，这种情况已经延续了一个月了。这使得每星期减产二千辆汽车。根据这个新决定，那些每星期还能工作五天的约一万七千名工人现在每星期只能工作四天，而那些每星期原来只能工作四天或三天的一万六千名工人则还要被削减一天的工作时间。这意味着，工人的收入将减少四镑左右。
    英国汽车公司是三天内采取削减工时措施的第三家汽车公司。标准汽车公司已经宣布解雇两千名工人。沃克斯霍尔汽车公司已经有一万名工人被缩短工作时间，现在又取消了夜班。鲁斯汽车公司、罗弗汽车工厂和其他汽车公司也解雇了数以千计的工人和削减了工作时间。
    同汽车工业有关的一些工厂也受到了影响。牛津轧钢厂解雇了二千名工人，因为汽车公司接受不了这家工厂制造的车身。这家工厂的斯温顿分厂今天宣布，它将解雇一千一百名工人，这使斯温顿的失业人数达到三十年代初期的不景气以来的最高峰。
    汽车生产的这种急剧下降，有力地说明了汽车工业所处的严重困境。在英国出口中占重要地位的汽车工业，现在已经陷入整个资本主义世界，尤其是美国的商业衰退之中，而美国是英国汽车的主要市场之一。根据最近的官方数字，从第一季度到第三季度，每月向北美出口的商品的平均价值下降一千万英镑，其中汽车占四百万英镑。同时，在西欧市场上，英国的汽车出口正面临着西德、法国和意大利的剧烈的竞争。在国内市场上，保守党紧缩信贷的政策和对分期付款购货的限制加剧了这个危机。
