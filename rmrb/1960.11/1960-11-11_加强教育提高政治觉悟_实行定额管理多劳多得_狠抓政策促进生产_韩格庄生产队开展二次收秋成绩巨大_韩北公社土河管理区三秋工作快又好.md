　　Hangezhuang Production Team Achieves Great Results in the Second Autumn Harvest
　　The Tuhe Management Area of the Hanbei Commune Does a Fast and Good Job in the Three Autumn Tasks

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Hangezhuang Production Brigade of the Fenggezhuang Commune in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, under the slogan of "Pick up everything that can be eaten, collect everything that can be fed, use everything that can be used, and gather everything that can be burned," has fully mobilized the masses to carry out field re-harvest work, determined to get everything that can be utilized. By October 20th, the entire team had picked up 1,301 jin of grain, 11,550 jin of fresh sweet potatoes, 153 jin of peanuts, collected 55,000 jin of various feed grasses, and 15,153 jin of various wild medicinal materials, fibers, and oilseeds.

　　This re-harvest was carried out after the basic completion of the autumn harvest. At the beginning, some commune members did not have a sufficient understanding of the re-harvest, thinking that "this year's autumn grain has already been harvested very carefully, and there is not much 'oil' to be gained from re-harvesting," "picking everywhere and collecting everything will take too much labor, it doesn't matter if some by-products are dropped as long as the grain is harvested well," and so on. In order to solve these ideological problems, the Party branch organized 56 Party members, Youth League members, and production team cadres to go to different teams and groups and use field meetings, appraisal meetings, and other forms to educate commune members on running agriculture on a large scale, running grain on a large scale, and running the commune diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. At the same time, the Party branch secretary led a re-harvest team to re-harvest three mu of sweet potatoes, picking out a total of 187 jin of sweet potatoes, averaging 62 jin per mu. Immediately afterward, an on-site meeting was held to specifically calculate the increase in production and income, and commune members such as Liu Cuihua were organized to introduce the achievements of the re-harvest.

　　On the basis of ideological mobilization, in order to further strengthen the leadership of the re-harvest work, the team established a re-harvest headquarters, and the entire team organized 60% of its labor force to invest in the re-harvest. In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the small teams and the vast number of commune members, the brigade conscientiously implemented the "three guarantees and one reward" system, announced its firm implementation of the policy of rewarding overproduction, and clearly stipulated that the re-harvested grain belongs to the small team. In the re-harvest, each small team conscientiously implemented the policy of work evaluation and point recording, more work more pay, and over-quota rewards. For example, for the re-harvested grain, in addition to determining quotas according to the potential for re-harvest and the ease and difficulty of various crops, reward standards were determined for exceeding the quota.

　　Due to the implementation of various policies, the enthusiasm of the re-harvesters was very high, and a competition movement with the content of "fast, more, clean, and complete" was launched between teams, groups, and individuals, determined to achieve greater results.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The three autumn tasks of the Tuhe Management Area of the Hanbei Commune in Wuxiang, Shanxi Province, have been basically completed. The entire area of 815 mu of sorghum was harvested cleanly in the spirit of full and careful harvesting, and all 635 mu of millet were threshed and stored in the granary; 645 mu of corn have also been harvested and brought home; more than 70% of the 2,220 mu of autumn land has been plowed.

　　If you ask why the three autumn tasks in the Tuhe Management Area have been done so well? In addition to strengthening the Party's political and ideological work, it was also determined to adhere to quota management. At the very beginning of autumn planting and autumn harvesting, the management committee arranged labor quotas for the thirty-six kinds of autumn agricultural work, such as cutting, transporting, threshing, plowing, stubble removal, and corn harvesting, and promptly inspected and supervised, so that quota management was implemented throughout, which is an important guarantee for completing the three autumn tasks in a faster, better, and more economical way.

　　At first, some captains thought it was too much trouble and did not take the quota seriously, still recording work points according to the "old ten points." After the Party branch discovered this problem, it immediately conducted a general inspection of quota management, and through comparison education, overcame the team cadres' fear of trouble, so that all five production teams scored and recorded work points according to the quota. Once this happened, it was very different. Cutting one (i.e., one bundle) of millet was worth one cent of work points according to the quota, and Gao Zhuying and Liang Eying cut sixty-five bundles of millet in one morning and earned six and a half work points. The women were eager to cut millet, and you could only hear the sound of scythes, not talking. In this way, after completing the winter wheat sowing task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, the entire management area basically completed the autumn plowing task half a month earlier than last year, and completed the grain purchase task of 400,000 jin. Now they are preparing to grind the grain, pay and sell surplus grain, and vigorously carry out the winter manure accumulation campaign.

### 加强教育提高政治觉悟　实行定额管理多劳多得  狠抓政策促进生产  韩格庄生产队开展二次收秋成绩巨大  韩北公社土河管理区三秋工作快又好

    加强教育提高政治觉悟　实行定额管理多劳多得
    狠抓政策促进生产
    韩格庄生产队开展二次收秋成绩巨大
    韩北公社土河管理区三秋工作快又好
    本报讯　山东莱阳县冯格庄公社韩格庄生产大队，在“能吃就拣，能喂就采，能用就收，能烧就拾”的口号下，充分发动群众，展开田间复收工作，决心把一切可以利用的东西全部拿到手。到10月20日，全队已拣回粮食一千三百零一斤，鲜地瓜一万一千五百五十斤，花生一百五十三斤，采集各种饲草五万五千斤，各种野生药材、纤维、油料一万五千一百五十三斤。
    这次复收是在秋收基本结束之后开展起来的。开始时，曾有部分社员对复收认识不足，以为“今年的秋粮已收的很细了，再复收油水不大”、“处处拣、样样收，劳力来不及，只要收好了粮食，副产品掉点不要紧”等等。为了解决这些思想问题，党支部组织五十六名党团员和生产队的干部，分队包组，利用地头会、评比会等形式，向社员进行了大办农业、大办粮食，以及勤俭办社、勤俭办一切事业的教育。与此同时，党支部书记带领一个复收小组，复收了三亩地瓜，共拣出地瓜一百八十七斤，每亩平均合六十二斤。随即开了现场会，具体算了增产增收账，并组织社员刘翠花等介绍了复收的成绩。
    在思想发动的基础上，该队为进一步加强复收工作的领导，建立了复收指挥部，全队共组织60％劳力投入复收。为了调动小队和广大社员的积极性，大队认真贯彻了
  “三包一奖”制度，宣布坚决贯彻超产奖励的政策，并明确规定复收的粮食归小队所有。在复收中，各小队又认真贯彻了评工记分，多劳多得，超额奖励的政策。如对复收粮食，除根据各种作物复收潜力的大小和易难，分别确定了定额以外，对超过定额部分确定了奖励标准。
    由于贯彻了各项政策，复收人员的积极性很高，队与队、组与组、人与人之间还展开了“快、多、净、全”为内容的竞赛运动，决心取得更大的成绩。
    本报讯　山西武乡韩北公社土河管理区的三秋工作已基本结束。全区八百一十五亩高粱本着全收细收的精神打了个净光，六百三十五亩谷子全部打完归仓；六百四十五亩玉茭，也已收回家中；二千二百二十亩秋地已耕过70％以上。
    要问土河管理区的三秋工作为什么搞得这样好？除加强了党的政治思想工作，还下决心坚持了定额管理。秋种、秋收刚刚开始，管理委员会就布置了割、运、打、耕、刨茬、收玉茭等秋季三十六种农活的劳动定额，并及时检查、督促，使定额管理贯彻始终，这是多快好省地完成三秋工作的重要保证。
    一开始有些队长嫌麻烦，没把定额当回事，仍然还是按“老十分”记工 。党支部发现这个问题以后，立即普遍检查定额管理，通过对比教育，克服了队干部怕麻烦的思想，使五个生产队都按照定额评分记工。这样一来，可就大不一样啦，按定额切一个（即一捆）谷记一厘工，高竹英、梁娥英一早上切了六十五个谷得六分五厘工。妇女切谷争先恐后，直听镰刀响，不见说话声。这样全管理区在提前和超额完成冬麦播种任务以后，又比去年提前半个月基本上完成了秋耕任务，并完成粮食征购任务四十万斤，现在正准备碾谷，缴售余粮，大搞冬季积肥运动。
