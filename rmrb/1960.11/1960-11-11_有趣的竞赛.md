    An Interesting Competition
    Zhang Shu
    Every time the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company holds a commendation and award ceremony, they invite employees from the Jiancaoping Store to participate, and units that win the red flag report the good news to the store. Why is the relationship between the factory and this store so close and yet so distinct in their honors? Read the news published today and you can find the answer.
    The news tells us: the honor enjoyed by the Jiancaoping Store stems from its revolutionary competition with the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel. The store employees made three guarantees to the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel, and the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel also made corresponding guarantees. Since then, the relationship between the two sides has become closer and closer, and no matter who wins the red flag in the internal competition of Taiyuan Iron and Steel, the Jiancaoping Store always has a share.
    We have seen many competitions between workers in the same industry, but competitions between different industries are rare. The competition between the Jiancaoping Store and the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel has expanded the scope of competition, which means that all units with work-related relationships can adopt the form of competition to promote the progress of both parties' work. Although the competition between the store and the factory is carried out between different industries, it plays a huge role in promoting the development of production, encouraging the workers of both the factory and the store to advance together, and further strengthening the cooperation between industry and commerce.
    Why can store-factory competitions produce such good results? An important reason is that the Jiancaoping Store has very clear political, production, and mass perspectives. They do not start from their own business to consider problems, but first "take the key to Taiyuan Iron and Steel's production as their own key to solve, and arrange the lives of the factory workers as their own lives." This is the fundamental reason for their great achievements in their work under the new situation.
    The usual concept of commercial work is to engage in circulation, distribution, and life services. However, it is not an easy task to truly do a good job in circulation and distribution and serve the masses well, especially to maximize the continuous leap forward in production through business activities and organize the economic life of the masses well, which is not easily achieved. However, as long as we establish a strong political perspective, production perspective, and mass perspective, the scope of commercial work will become wider and wider, the content will become richer and richer, there will be more and more ways to serve production and promote production, and the achievements will become more and more remarkable. The competition between the Jiancaoping Store employees and the Taiyuan Iron and Steel workers is extremely interesting and meaningful. Learning from their thinking of serving steel production wholeheartedly and their business methods, and learning from their political, production, and mass perspectives in their work, we can also develop our business, improve efficiency, and have the possibility of enjoying the honors we deserve, just like them.

    有趣的竞赛
    张澍
    太原钢铁公司职工每次召开评比发奖大会的时候，都请尖草坪商店职工参加，获得红旗的单位都要向商店报喜。为什么工厂和这个商店的关系如此亲密无间、而且又分得如此荣誉呢？读一读今天刊登的消息就可以找到答案。
    消息告诉我们：尖草坪商店享得的荣誉，来源于它同太钢职工之间的革命竞赛。商店职工向太钢职工提出保证三条，太钢职工也提出了相应的保证。从此，两方关系愈来愈亲密，太钢内部的红旗竞赛，不管由谁得奖，也少不了尖草坪商店的份儿。
    我们曾经看到许许多多的同工种竞赛，而不同行业的竞赛却不多见。尖草坪商店同太钢职工之间的竞赛，展拓了竞赛的天地，这就是说，所有工作上发生关系的单位都可以采取竞赛的形式，促进双方工作的进展。店厂之间的竞赛，虽然是在不同行业之间进行的，但它对于促进生产的发展、对于促进厂、店双方职工互相鼓舞、共同跃进，对于进一步密切工商的协作都起了巨大的作用。
    为什么店、厂竞赛能够产生这样好的效果呢？重要的一个原因就是尖草坪商店的政治、生产和群众三大观点十分明确，他们不是先从自己的业务出发考虑问题，而是首先要“把太钢的生产关键当成自己的关键去解决，把工厂职工的生活当成自己的生活去安排”这就是他们在新的形势下工作取得巨大成绩的根本所在。
    商业工作通常的概念是搞流通、分配和生活服务的。但是，要真正搞好流通、分配，并为群众生活服务得很好，并不是一件容易的事情，特别是要通过业务活动最大限度地促进生产的持续跃进并组织好群众的经济生活，更不是轻而易举地得来的。但是，只要树立了坚强的政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，商业工作的天地就会越来越广阔，内容就会越来越丰富，服务生产和促进生产的办法也愈来愈多，取得的成绩也一定越来越显著。尖草坪商店职工同太钢职工之间的竞赛是极有趣味的，也是极有意义的。学习他们这种全力为钢的思想和经营方法，学习他们工作中的政治、生产和群众三大观点，就同样能开展业务，提高效率，也就有可能像他们那样享得应有的荣誉。
