Saving and increasing production are interdependent. Increased production cannot be separated from saving, and saving is for the sake of increased production. Increased production requires us to produce more material wealth for the country and for socialism, and true increased production must be based on improving labor productivity, increasing production to the maximum extent possible with the least consumption of manpower, materials, and financial resources. Without saving manpower, materials, and financial resources, there can be no real increase in production. Saving requires us to be meticulous and rational in using social wealth, without any waste, which means striving to do more with the least cost. The manpower and materials we save must be used to expand production. If the savings are not used for legitimate needs or to increase production, it is still not real saving. The purpose of saving is to increase production; the more we save, the more we can increase production. Saving is by no means a passive measure, but rather an active measure to promote production.

Increased production and saving, though different paths, lead to the same goal and will ultimately be reflected in the improvement of labor productivity. Therefore, in order to develop social productive forces at the fastest speed and rapidly build socialism and communism, it is necessary to grasp both increased production and saving simultaneously. All social wealth is created by labor. The economical use of social wealth is ultimately the saving of labor power and labor time. In the production process, improving labor efficiency and completing the same amount or more work with less manpower is the saving of live labor, which is the saving of labor time. In the production process, reducing material consumption is the saving of materialized labor, which is the saving of labor time consumed in creating these materials in the past. By consuming less raw materials, materials, fuel, and other materials to produce the same amount of products, or more products, the entire society can invest less labor and labor time in the production of these materials, and a large amount of labor can be drawn from them to engage in the production of other materials. Workers in the spinning department of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 12 once calculated the cotton consumption: according to the calculation of saving one kilogram of cotton per piece of cotton yarn, the entire factory can save more than 31,000 kilograms of cotton in four months, which is equivalent to the output of 300 mu of cotton fields. If it takes farmers 30 workdays to grow and harvest one mu of cotton, more than 9,000 workdays can be freed from the cotton fields to increase grain or other crops. This is one of the good ways to support agriculture and increase agricultural production. We should pay attention to saving material consumption, and we should also always grasp the economical use of labor power, and try to save the consumption of live labor in production. The saving of labor power is the greatest saving, and the waste of labor power is the greatest waste. China's 600 million working people are a great productive force and the main reliance for changing China's poor and blank state. Organizing labor power rationally, tapping potential, saving its use, and using the saved labor power to do more things and increase production more, can greatly improve the level of productive forces. This kind of saving is of course the greatest saving. Comrade Mao Zedong has always taught us to "cherish manpower and material resources." Today, in the process of vigorous development of socialist construction, labor power has changed from a relative surplus to a relative shortage, and labor power should be distributed and used more rationally. Any place and any unit must improve labor efficiency, adjust labor organization, streamline institutions, and give full play to the initiative and creativity of every worker, so that every labor power can do the work of several people, and all the labor power that can be saved can be used where it is most needed, and used for direct productive labor.

The core issue of the Party's general line for socialist construction is to strive for high speed. Increased production and saving, in essence, requires the most full and rational use of labor power and labor time. Winning time means winning high speed. The general policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results is an indivisible unity. Greater and faster is one aspect, and better and more economical is another aspect. The two sides are opposed to each other, but they are unified in this complete policy. Mechanically dividing the general policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and unilaterally emphasizing one aspect, or only pursuing greater and faster results while ignoring better and more economical results, or only pursuing better and more economical results while ignoring greater and faster results, will cause waste. Only by fully implementing the general policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results can we make the most of manpower, materials, and financial resources, and maximize the enthusiasm of workers, and achieve the greatest savings in the development of the entire production and construction cause.

Achieving the greatest savings in production and construction is an inevitable manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system. Because the socialist system has established public ownership of the means of production, the working people have become the masters of social wealth, and the working people can actively and consciously strive to increase production and practice economy with the attitude of masters, and the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and thrift can be further developed. This is the fundamental reliance for us to continuously increase production and practice economy. The socialist system provides the objective inevitability of the planned and proportionate development of the national economy. The state can plan to use social labor and natural resources, rationally adjust the industrial layout, and uniformly arrange production, distribution, consumption, and accumulation, etc., and can make the greatest use and the greatest savings of the entire society's manpower, materials, and financial resources. All of this is unimaginable in capitalist society. Under the capitalist system, the material wealth created by the working people is taken away by the exploiters, and the enthusiasm of the working people to increase production and practice economy is suppressed and cannot be fully utilized. Capitalist countries' cities are crowded with a large number of unemployed reserve armies, and there is a surplus of population, poverty, and bankruptcy in rural areas. Labor power is wasted in large quantities, and labor results are squandered in large quantities. This is the fatal wound of the capitalist system. All declining and decadent exploiting classes, because they have no future and lose hope, try to squander social wealth as much as possible, and are extravagant and wasteful, while all emerging revolutionary classes are different, because they need to start a family and establish a career, and build a new life not only for today but also for tomorrow, and always pay great attention to saving and accumulating wealth, and advocate hard struggle; especially the working class with communist lofty aspirations, shouldering the great task of transforming nature and transforming the world, will show even more radiant and vigorous revolutionary spirit. As long as the people of the whole country adhere to such a revolutionary spirit, work diligently and thriftily, and work hard, even the greatest difficulties will be overcome by us, and great miracles will be created by us.

### 节约为了增产

    节约为了增产
    增产和节约有着相辅相成的依存关系。增产离不开节约，节约也就是为了增产。增产，就是要求我们为国家、为社会主义生产出更多的物质财富，而真正的增产，必须是在提高劳动生产率的基础上，以最小的人力、物力、财力的消耗，最大限度地增加生产，脱离了人力、物力、财力的节约，是谈不到真正的增产的。节约，就是要求我们对社会财富处处精打细算、合理使用，不要有半点浪费，也就是要求争取以最小的代价，办更多的事情。我们节约下来的人力、物力，必须用来扩大生产，如果把节约所得，不用在正当需要上，不用来增加生产，这仍然不是真正的节约。节约的目的，就是为了增产；愈是节约，也就愈能增产。节约决不是什么消极的措施，恰恰是促进生产的积极措施。
    增产和节约，异途同归，最终必然表现为劳动生产率的提高。所以，为了以最快速度发展社会生产力，迅速建设社会主义和共产主义，必须增产节约同时抓。一切社会财富都是由劳动创造的。对社会财富的节约使用，归根结蒂都是劳动力和劳动时间的节约。我们在生产过程中，提高劳动效率，以较少的人力完成同等数量或更多的工作，这种活劳动的节约是劳动时间的节约。在生产过程中，减少物质消耗是物化劳动的节约，也就是节约了过去在创造这些物质时所消耗的劳动时间。以较少的原料、材料、燃料等物资的消耗，生产同样数量的产品，或更多的产品，就可以使整个社会以较少的劳动力、劳动时间投放在这些物资的生产上，从中抽出大量劳动力来从事其他物资的生产。上海国棉十二厂的纺部工人曾经算了一笔用棉账，按照每件棉纱节约用棉一公斤计算，全厂四个月就能节约三万一千多公斤的棉花，相当于三百亩棉田的产量。如果一亩棉田从种到收，要花费农民三十个劳动日，就可以有九千多个劳动日从棉田中腾出来，增产粮食或其他作物，这正是支援农业、增加农业生产的良好方法之一。我们应该注意物质消耗的节约，也更应该时刻抓紧劳动力的节约使用，在生产中尽量节约活劳动的消耗。劳动力的节约是最大的节约，劳动力的浪费是最大的浪费。我国六亿多劳动人民是一支伟大的生产力，是我国改变一穷二白面貌的主要依靠。把劳动力合理地组织起来，挖掘潜力，节约使用，用节约下来的劳动力来办更多的事，更多地增加生产，就能大大提高生产力水平，这种节约当然是最大的节约。毛泽东同志一贯谆谆教导我们要“爱惜人力、物力”。今天，在社会主义建设事业蓬勃发展的进程中，劳动力已从相对的有余变成相对的不足，更应该最合理地分配和使用劳动力。任何地方、任何单位都要提高劳动效率，调整劳动组织，精简机构，充分发挥每一个劳动者的积极性、创造性，使每一个劳动力做到一顶几，把一切可以节约出来的劳动力，用到最需要的地方去，用之于直接的生产劳动。
    党的社会主义建设总路线的核心问题，就是力争高速度。增产节约，从本质上看，就是要求最充分、最合理地使用劳动力、劳动时间，赢得了时间，也就赢得了高速度。多快好省的方针是一个不可分割的统一体。多快是一个方面，好省又是一个方面，双方是对立的，但又统一在这一完整的方针之中。机械地把多快好省的方针分割开来，片面地强调其中一个方面，或者只追求多快而忽视好省，或者只追求好省而忽视多快，都会造成浪费。只有全面地贯彻多快好省的方针，才能最充分地利用人力、物力、财力，使劳动者的积极性最高度地发挥起来，可以在整个生产建设事业的发展中取得最大的节约。
    在生产建设中能够获致最大的节约是社会主义制度优越性的必然表现。由于社会主义制度建立了生产资料公有制，劳动人民成了社会财富的主人，劳动人民才能以主人翁态度积极地自觉地努力增产、厉行节约，艰苦奋斗、克勤克俭的革命精神才能得到更大的发扬，这是我们赖以不断进行增产节约的根本依靠。社会主义制度提供了国民经济有计划按比例地发展的客观必然性，国家能够有计划地利用社会劳动和自然资源，合理调整工业布局，统一安排生产、分配、消费和积累等等，对整个社会的人力、物力、财力能够进行最大的利用和最大的节约。所有这一切，在资本主义社会中是不可想像的。在资本主义制度下，劳动人民双手创造出来的物质财富都被剥削者夺去了，劳动人民增产节约的积极性受到了压制，无从充分发挥。资本主义国家城市中拥塞着大批失业后备军，农村中人口过剩，贫困破产。劳动力被大量浪费，劳动成果被大量挥霍，这正是资本主义制度的致命伤。一切没落的腐朽的剥削阶级，由于它们没有前途，失去希望，对社会财富就尽量挥霍无度，铺张浪费，而一切新兴的革命的阶级则不同，因为他们需要创家立业，不仅为了今天，更要为了明天而建设新生活，总是十分注意节约和积累财富，提倡艰苦奋斗的；特别是有共产主义雄心壮志的工人阶级，肩负着改造自然，改造世界的伟大任务，就更加表现出精神焕发，朝气勃勃的革命精神。只要全国人民坚持这样的革命精神，勤劳节俭，埋头苦干，天大的困难就会被我们克服，伟大的奇迹就会被我们创造出来。
