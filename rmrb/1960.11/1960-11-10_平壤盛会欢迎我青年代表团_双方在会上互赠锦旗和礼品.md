Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th November. A grand rally was held by Pyongyang youth and students tonight at the Moranbong Theatre to warmly welcome the Chinese Youth Delegation to North Korea, led by Li Qitao, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League.
　　Li Qitao and all members of the delegation, accompanied by Wu Xuanzhou, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, and others, ascended the rostrum, which was decorated with huge portraits of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong.
　　Gao Shangjun, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, spoke at the welcoming meeting, extending a warm welcome to the delegation on behalf of all Korean youth. He said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people and youth, holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, have achieved new successes in socialist construction this year after successive leaps forward in 1958 and 1959, and are determined to continue to make all-round leaps forward in the development of the national economy in the future. Chinese youth are at the forefront of the Great Leap Forward. Gao Shangjun then spoke of the heroic deeds of the youth in North Korea responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party, carrying out technical innovation movements, and struggling to overcome various difficulties. He also spoke about the struggle launched by the youth and people in South Korea against the colonial rule of American imperialism.
　　Gao Shangjun said that the people and youth of North Korea and China have forged the closest comradeship through long-term joint struggles against foreign aggressors. He said that American imperialism is the common enemy of the people and youth of our two countries, and that if the people and youth of our two countries unite and fight, we can smash all the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism.
　　Li Qitao then spoke amidst warm applause, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome from the Korean comrades.
　　Li Qitao said that our two countries are connected by mountains and rivers, and the people of our two countries are of one heart. The people and youth of North Korea and China have forged a deep friendship with blood in the struggle against the common enemy—imperialism. He also said that the Chinese and North Korean people gave American imperialism a heavy blow in the Korean War, profoundly educating the youth and people of the world, and demonstrating that American imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside.
　　Li Qitao then warmly praised the brilliant achievements made by the Korean people and youth in post-war socialist construction at the speed of the Chollima. He said that all this irrefutably proves the victory of Marxism-Leninism in North Korea, proves the superiority of the socialist system, and also points out the way forward and the direction of struggle for the youth and people in South Korea who are in dire straits.
　　At the meeting, Wu Xuanzhou, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, presented the delegation with a banner on behalf of the Korean Democratic Youth League, which was embroidered with: "Long live the eternal friendship and unity between the people and youth of North Korea and China, forged in blood." Li Qitao also presented a gift to the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, a huge emblem of the Chinese Communist Youth League. Li Qitao also presented a banner to the youth of Pyongyang.

    平壤盛会欢迎我青年代表团
    双方在会上互赠锦旗和礼品
    新华社平壤9日电　平壤市青年学生今天晚上在牡丹峰剧场举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎以中国共产主义青年团中央书记处书记李琦涛为首的中国访朝青年代表团。
    李琦涛和全体团员由朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会委员长吴铉周等陪同，登上了悬挂着金日成首相和毛泽东主席的巨幅画像的主席台。
    朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会副委员长高尚俊在欢迎会上讲话，代表全体朝鲜青年向代表团表示热烈的欢迎。他说，中国人民和青年在中国共产党的领导下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，在1958年和1959年连续跃进以后，今年又在社会主义建设中取得了新的成就，并决心今后在发展国民经济中继续全面跃进。中国青年站在大跃进的最前列。高尚俊接着谈到了朝鲜北部的青年响应朝鲜劳动党的号召，开展技术革新运动、为克服各种困难而斗争的英雄事迹。他还谈到了朝鲜南部的青年和人民掀起的反对美帝国主义殖民统治的斗争。
    高尚俊说，朝中两国人民和青年，通过反对外来侵略者的长期的共同斗争，结成了最亲密的战友。他说，美帝国主义是我们两国人民和青年的共同敌人，我们两国人民和青年团结起来进行斗争，就能粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋。
    李琦涛接着在热烈的掌声中讲话，对朝鲜同志的热情的欢迎表示感谢。
    李琦涛说，我们两国山连山、水连水，两国人民心连心，朝中两国人民和青年在反对共同的敌人——帝国主义的斗争中，用鲜血结成了深厚的友情。他又说，中朝人民在朝鲜战争中给了美帝国主义以沉重打击，深刻地教育了全世界的青年和人民，说明美帝国主义是一只外强中干的纸老虎。
    李琦涛接着热情地赞扬了朝鲜人民和青年以千里马的速度在战后的社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就。他说，这一切无可辩驳地证明了，马克思列宁主义在朝鲜的胜利，证明了社会主义制度的优越性，同时也给那些处于水深火热之中的朝鲜南部的青年和人民指明了前进的道路和斗争的方向。
    会上，朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会委员长吴铉周代表朝鲜民主青年同盟赠给代表团一面锦旗，锦旗上绣着：“以鲜血结成的朝中两国人民和青年之间的永恒的友谊团结万岁”。李琦涛也代表中国共产主义青年团中央委员会向朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会赠礼，礼品是一个巨大的中国共青团团徽。李琦涛还赠给平壤市青年一面锦旗。
