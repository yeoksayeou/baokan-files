Regardless of Output Value or Production Difficulty, Production is Arranged as Long as the Ordering Unit Needs It
Beijing Automobile Factory Completes Contract Tasks Every Month
This newspaper reports that the workers of the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Factory regard the execution of production accessory and component ordering contracts as an important political task. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has delivered goods on time or ahead of schedule every month and every quarter in accordance with the contract stipulations. By the end of October, it had completed more than 98% of the total ordering contract tasks for the entire year, enabling all ordering units to receive the necessary accessories and components in a timely manner.

The Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Factory is a factory mainly producing automobile and tractor accessories and components. This year, according to the national plan, it has accepted ordering tasks from more than sixty units, including Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Factory and Luoyang First Tractor Factory. This is the year with the most accessory production for other factories in history, with various accessories increasing by 190% compared to last year alone. In order to complete the contract tasks on time, all employees of the factory arranged production for each month, each ten-day period, and each day according to the contract, and tried every means to overcome various difficulties. When there were not enough automatic lathes for producing contract products, they sent cadres and veteran workers, with materials and tools, to borrow equipment from six units in the city and other places for processing or organizing collaboration. Automobile accessories are mostly stamping and die-casting work, but the factory's die-casting capacity could not meet production needs. All employees organized many "three-way combination" groups, divided labor and cooperated, carried out technical innovation in a big way, and attacked this weak link. After twenty days of hard work, they successfully designed and manufactured a new type of die-casting mold, which rapidly increased the output of carburetor die-casting shifts from 550 pieces to 930 pieces, basically meeting the processing needs of contract products.

In order to make the contract products meet the quality requirements of users, the factory's leading cadres often took technicians and workers to the using units to solicit opinions on the products. After returning to the factory, they widely mobilized the masses to discuss them item by item, and assigned special personnel to be responsible for solving them. The workers of the factory's famous national advanced collective, the "Double-ization Shock Brigade," conducted more than one hundred experiments in order to improve the quality of automobile accessory paint spraying. They adopted spraying, pouring, dipping and many other advanced technologies, and changed from manual paint spraying to automated paint spraying, greatly improving the quality of automobile accessory paint spraying, and reducing the rework rate from 33% to 8%. The factory strictly implements the quality inspection system, and each process has established and improved quality supervision posts and inspection stations for contract products. Due to the importance attached to it by all employees of the factory, the contract products have all met the quality requirements.

As long as the ordering unit needs it, the factory's employees carefully arrange production regardless of the size of the product, the level of output value, or the difficulty of production. The output value of bent pipe joints is low, the workload is large, and the scrap rate is also high. In the third quarter, the factory originally did not arrange contract tasks for the production of this product. However, the Changchun Automobile Parts Factory needed this part very much, so they completed the task on time. The output value of automobile accessory oil seals is high, and one can be made in one minute. Although carburetors are ten times more expensive than oil seals, it takes more than two hours to make one. Therefore, some people advocated producing more oil seals and less carburetors. In response to this idea, the factory's Party committee and the general Party branch of the accessory workshop mobilized the masses to conduct a brainstorming session. The employees seriously criticized this one-sided view of only looking at their own interests and disregarding the overall situation, arranged the production of carburetors in accordance with the contract, and the manufacturing workers tried every means to improve the product design of carburetors, shorten working hours, improve the performance of carburetors, and ensure the ordering unit's need for carburetors.

In order to ensure the completion of contract tasks on time, with quality and quantity, the factory established a command headquarters headed by the Party committee secretary to comprehensively grasp production, and check the quantity, quality, variety and specifications of completed contracts every day, and immediately mobilize all aspects of the force to solve problems.

Constantly strengthening political and ideological work, and regularly educating employees with the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard," is the fundamental reason why this factory's contract tasks are completed well. The factory's Party committee promptly commended advanced units and individuals who performed well in executing contracts, and waged struggle against the erroneous tendency of neglecting contract production, so that all employees of the factory clearly established the idea of ​​local subordination to the overall situation and taking pride in being a "supporting role." Therefore, everyone regards the execution of contract tasks as their sacred responsibility to complete the national plan. (Attached picture)

### 不论产值高低、生产难易，只要订货单位需要，就安排生产  北京汽车厂月月完成合同任务

    不论产值高低、生产难易，只要订货单位需要，就安排生产
    北京汽车厂月月完成合同任务
    本报讯　北京汽车制造厂职工把执行生产附件、配件的订货合同作为一项重要政治任务。今年以来，这个厂按照合同规定逐月逐季按时提前交货，到10月底，已完成全年订货合同总任务的98％以上，使所有订货单位及时得到了所需要的附件、配件。
    北京汽车制造厂是一个主要生产汽车、拖拉机附件和配件的工厂，今年根据国家计划，共接受了长春第一汽车制造厂、洛阳第一拖拉机厂等六十多个单位的订货任务，是历年来为外厂配套最多的一年，其中仅各种配件就比去年提高190％。为了按时完成合同任务，这个厂的全体职工按照合同具体安排每月、每旬、每天的生产，千方百计克服各种困难。生产合同产品的自动车床不够用，他们就派出干部和老工人，带着材料和工具，到本市和外地等六个单位借用设备，进行加工或组织协作。汽车附件大都是冲压、压铸活，但这个工厂的压铸能力不能满足生产需要，全厂职工组织了许多个“三结合”小组，分工协作，大搞技术革新，猛攻这个薄弱环节，经过二十天奋战，设计制造成功了新型的压铸模，使化油器的压铸班产量由五百五十份迅速提高到九百三十份，基本上满足了合同产品的加工需要。
    为使合同产品合乎用户的质量要求，这个厂的领导干部经常带着技术人员和工人到使用单位，征求对产品的意见，回厂后广泛发动群众逐条进行讨论，并责成专人负责解决。这个工厂著名的全国先进集体“双化突击队”的工人，为了提高汽车附件喷漆的质量，曾进行了一百多次试验，采用喷、浇、蘸和其他许多先进技术，由手工喷漆变为自动化喷漆，使汽车附件喷漆质量大大提高，返修率由33％下降到8％。全厂严格执行质量检查制度，各个工序都建立和健全了合同产品质量监督岗、检查站。由于全厂职工的重视，合同产品都达到了质量要求。
    只要订货单位需要，不论产品大小，产值高低和生产难易，这个厂的职工都认真地安排生产。弯管接头产值低，工作量大，废品率也高，第三季度工厂原没有安排生产这种产品的合同任务。但是长春汽车配件厂很需要这种零件，他们就按时完成了任务。汽车配件油封产值高，一分钟可做一个，化油器虽比油封贵十倍，却要两个多小时才做一个，因此，有的人主张多生产油封，少生产化油器。针对这种思想，工厂党委和附件车间党总支发动群众进行务虚，职工们严肃地批判了这种只看自己利益不顾大局的片面观点，按照合同安排了化油器的生产，制造工人并千方百计改进化油器的产品设计，缩短工时，提高了化油器的性能，保证了订货单位对化油器的需要。
    为了确保合同任务按时按质按量的完成，这个厂由党委书记挂帅，成立了全面抓生产的指挥部，天天检查完成合同的数量、质量、品种和规格，发现问题立即调集各方面的力量突击解决。
    不断地加强政治思想工作，经常以“全国一盘棋”的精神教育职工，是这个工厂合同任务完成好的根本原因。工厂党委随时表扬执行合同好的先进单位和人物，向忽视合同生产的错误倾向进行斗争，使全厂职工明确地树立起了局部服从整体，以当“配角”为荣的思想，因此，人人都把执行合同任务作为自己完成国家计划的神圣职责。（附图片）
