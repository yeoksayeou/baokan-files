    (Our report) Xi'an, Shaanxi Province - The Party branch of Shenlufang Elementary School in Baqiao District, Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, educates students to love labor from an early age, cultivating good labor habits and improving their academic performance.

    Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Shenlufang Elementary School, in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor, established a small farm on campus, carried out diverse labor activities, and closely integrated productive labor with teaching. It has become a banner for the entire province in implementing the policy of combining education with productive labor in elementary schools.

    In March of this year, the school's Party branch further proposed the slogan of "Labor from an early age, labor every day." The specific approach is as follows: In terms of labor time, lower-grade students increased their labor time from five minutes to fifteen minutes per day; middle-grade students increased their labor time from twenty-five minutes to forty minutes per day; and upper-grade students increased their labor time from forty minutes to one hour per day. In terms of labor content, full consideration is given to the age and physical condition of the children, and it is integrated with teaching as much as possible. Upper-grade students mainly conduct agricultural production experiments related to natural science courses, manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, and engage in meteorological observation activities. Middle-grade students, combined with relevant general knowledge texts, mainly engage in vegetable and oil crop planting, animal husbandry, weaving, and other activities. Lower-grade students participate in some auxiliary labor, such as catching insects and picking up small stones in cultivated land. Within the same grade, labor content also varies due to differences in age and physical condition. For example, older students in the upper grades participate in sowing, weeding, and vegetable bundling, while those who are physically weaker participate in fish farming, chicken raising, and chalk making. Labor projects have also increased, expanding from running small farms to running small factories, from engaging in agricultural production to engaging in sideline production (such as duck feeding), from participating in on-campus labor to participating in off-campus labor, and appropriately increasing social public service labor.

    Shenlufang Elementary School has more than six hundred and forty students and twenty-four teachers. To persist in laboring every day, the on-campus labor base alone cannot accommodate all teachers and students. The school's Party branch has opened up vast off-campus labor fields as places for labor training and teaching practice. Currently, the school has established connections with the Baqiao Cement Plant, the Baqiao Fertilizer Biological Plant, the Commune Agricultural Experiment Station, the Veterinary Station, and the Orchard Team. Each class in the upper grades and every two classes in the middle grades have established fixed connections with a production team. With such a connection point, students can fully utilize the factory's equipment and the production team's fields for labor to supplement the lack of on-campus labor sites and technology. With such a connection point, students can also frequently participate in some social public service labor, such as gleaning wheat ears, cutting grass, pulling radishes, picking tomatoes, and collecting waste materials. Because students often labor with workers and commune members, they gain a more comprehensive understanding of the noble qualities of the working people, thereby cultivating feelings and thoughts of the working people.

    The school's Party branch pays special attention to grasping political and ideological work throughout the process of students participating in labor, inspiring students to consciously participate in labor and making labor a regular practice. Before each labor activity, teachers explain the purpose and content of the labor to the students. After labor, they have students discuss and summarize the ideological gains from the labor. Students who perform well in labor are praised on the same day. After students leave school, many teachers also conduct home visits to understand the students' labor situation after returning home. Teacher Zhang Zongyi, through home visits, found that some students labored well at school but not so well at home, so he promptly educated the students to labor well at school and at home, so that students actively participated in labor everywhere. The school also holds an exhibition room, regularly exhibiting students' labor achievements to stimulate students' enthusiasm to further participate in labor. In daily teaching, teachers also pay attention to educating students on labor viewpoints. For example, when teacher Wang Fangqing taught the third grade the language lesson "Winter Apple Orchard," she led the students to the apple trees on campus, combined with the text, to cultivate the soil, apply whitewash, and wrap paper strips for the apple trees. While laboring, she said to the students, "Let's put on 'cotton coats' for the saplings so that they don't get cold and will grow better next year." In the spring, when the apple trees on campus were blooming and turning green, Wang Fangqing led the third-grade students to the apple trees again and explained the language lesson "Spring Apple Orchard." She first pruned the branches for the students to see, and then she and the students fertilized the apple trees together. Since the students participated in the labor of caring for the apples, they understood the value of the fruits of labor.

    According to several months of practice, the Shenlufang Elementary School's organization of students to labor from an early age and labor every day has had very good results. A atmosphere of both loving reading and loving labor has appeared in the school. It has cultivated the students' labor habits and improved the quality of their studies. Every day, whether at school, at home, or in the production team, students can be seen consciously participating in labor within their capacity during their spare time. Through frequent labor, the students have all improved their ideological understanding. For example, Su Pengnian, a sixth-grade student, once participated in labor in the sixth production team of Shenlufang. He was deeply moved by seeing a commune member named Li Zhenzhou driving a cart in the rain and resolved to learn his spirit of selfless labor. A month later, on an afternoon during the summer harvest, Su Pengnian received a rain forecast from the Red Scarf Meteorological Station in the school. He immediately gathered several classmates and rushed to tell the production team, and together with the commune members, they transported the corn drying in front of the school gate to a vacant classroom. The next morning, they came to school wading through the mud and were overjoyed to see that the corn was fine, jumping and skipping with joy. Through frequent labor, students have also increased their production knowledge and skills.

    紧密结合教学工作　组织多种多样劳动
    神鹿坊小学学生学习好劳动好
    本报讯　陕西省西安市灞桥区神鹿坊小学党支部教育学生从小热爱劳动，使学生养成了劳动习惯，提高了学习质量。
    神鹿坊小学从1958年大跃进以来，在贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针中，举办了校内小农场，开展多种多样的劳动活动，把生产劳动和教学紧密地结合起来，成为全省小学贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合方针的旗帜。
    今年3月，这个学校党支部进一步提出从小劳动、天天劳动的口号。具体作法是：在劳动时间的安排上，低年级学生由原来每天劳动五分钟，增加到每天劳动十五分钟；中年级学生由原来每天劳动二十五分钟，增加到四十分钟；高年级学生由原来每天劳动四十分钟增加到一小时。在劳动内容上，也充分照顾到儿童的年龄和体质，并尽可能结合教学。高年级学生主要作与自然课有关的农业生产试验、制造化肥、农药和气象观测等活动；中年级学生结合有关常识性的课文：主要进行蔬菜、油料作物的种植、动物饲养、编织等活动；低年级学生参加一些辅助性的劳动，如捉虫、拣耕地里的小石块等。在同一年级内，因为年龄、体质不同，劳动内容也有区别，如高年级年龄大的学生参加播种、锄草、捆菜；身体弱的参加养鱼、养鸡、制造粉笔等。劳动项目，也有了增加，从办小农场扩展到办小工厂，从搞农业生产扩大到搞副业生产（如喂鸭等），从参加校内劳动到参加校外劳动，并适当增加社会公益劳动。
    神鹿坊小学共有六百四十多名学生和二十四名教师。要坚持天天劳动，单有校内劳动基地还容纳不下全部师生。学校党支部就开辟校外广阔的劳动田地，作为劳动锻炼和教学实践的场所。目前，这个学校已与灞桥水泥厂、灞桥化肥生物厂、公社农业试验站、兽医站、果林队挂了钩。高年级每一个班、中年级每两个班都与一个生产队建立了固定的联系。有了这样联系的基点，学生可以充分利用工厂的设备、生产队的田地进行劳动，以补充校内劳动场地、技术的不足。有了这样联系的基点，学生还可以经常参加一些社会公益劳动。如拾麦穗、割草、拔萝卜、摘蕃茄和拣废料等。由于学生经常与工人、公社社员在一起劳动，就更全面地了解劳动人民的高尚品质，从而培养起劳动人民的思想感情。
    这个学校党支部特别注意在学生参加劳动的过程中，自始至终抓紧政治思想工作，启发学生自觉地参加劳动，使劳动经常化。每天劳动前，教师都先向学生讲清劳动的目的和内容；劳动后又让学生讨论，总结劳动中的思想收获。对于劳动好的学生，当天就加以表扬。学生放学回家，不少教师还进行家庭访问，了解学生回家后的劳动情况。教师张宗义通过家庭访问，发现有的学生在校劳动好、在家劳动不算好，就及时教育学生在校劳动好，在家也要劳动好，使得学生处处积极参加劳动。学校还举办了一个展览室，经常展出学生的劳动成果，激发学生进一步参加劳动的积极性。在日常的教学中，教师们也注意向学生进行劳动观点的教育。像教师王芳清给三年级讲“冬天苹果园”的语文课时，就领着学生到校园里的苹果树下，结合课文，给苹果树培土壤、涂白浆、裹纸条。她一边劳动，一边对学生说：“咱们给小树穿好‘棉袄’，别让它受冻，来年就长得更好了。”春天，正当校园里的苹果树花落叶绿的时候，王芳清又领着三年级的学生来到苹果树下，讲解语文课“春天的苹果园”。她先修剪枝条给学生看，然后又和学生一起给苹果树施肥。自从学生参加养护苹果的劳动后，懂得了劳动成果的珍贵。
    根据几个月的实践证明，神鹿坊小学组织学生从小劳动，天天劳动的效果很好。学校内出现了既爱读书，又爱劳动的风气。既养成了学生们的劳动习惯，又提高了学习质量。每天，不论在学校里或在家里、生产队里，都可以看到学生在课余自觉地参加力所能及的劳动。经过经常的劳动，学生们都提高了思想认识。例如六年级学生苏彭年，有一次到神鹿坊第六生产小队参加劳动，看见一位名叫李振洲的公社社员冒雨赶车，深受感动，决心学习他的忘我劳动精神。一月后，正逢夏收的一个下午，苏彭年在学校里的红领巾气象站，得到下雨的预报，就约了几位同学赶紧跑去告诉生产队，并与社员一起把晒在校门前的玉米，运到一间空闲的教室里。第二天早晨，他们踏着泥泞来校，看见玉米好好的，高兴的连蹦带跳。通过经常的劳动，学生也增长了很多生产知识和生产技能。
