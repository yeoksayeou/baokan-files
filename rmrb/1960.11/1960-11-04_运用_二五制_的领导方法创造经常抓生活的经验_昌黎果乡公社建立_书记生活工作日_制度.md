Utilizing the "Two-Five System" Leadership Method to Create Experience in Regularly Grasping Life
Changli Fruit Township Commune Establishes "Secretary Life Work Day" System
Party Committee Secretaries Regularly Go Deep into the Front Lines of Life Every Week to Specifically Lead the Running of Canteens, Arrange Life, and Promote Production

(People's Daily News) The Fruit Township Commune Party Committee in Changli County, in its efforts to vigorously grasp life, is using and developing the "Two-Five System" leadership method and implementing a "Secretary Life Work Day" system. This is making the work of grasping life regular and systematic.

The "Secretary Life Work Day" is based on the implementation of the "Two-Five System" leadership method. The system of two days for learning and summarizing work remains unchanged, and during the five days of going to the countryside, two days (namely, Wednesdays and Saturdays each week) are used, from the first secretary of the commune party committee to the party branch secretary of the production team, to go deep into the front lines of life to carry out work.

With the in-depth development of large-scale grain production and grasping of life, the Fruit Township Commune Party Committee further recognized the important role of grasping life in promoting production and deeply realized that to grasp life regularly, comprehensively, and meticulously, there must be a set of corresponding working methods. In the past, some party organizations and cadres grasped life only in a general way, and were not good at closely integrating grasping production with grasping life. As a result, they either grasped production and neglected life, or grasped life and forgot production. In response to this situation, the commune party committee carefully discussed and studied, and based on the spirit of the "Two-Five System," through dissecting the typical example of the secretaries of the Bali Village Management District's party organizations going deep into the canteens, determined to implement the "Secretary Life Work Day."

The canteen is the center for arranging the lives of the masses. The Fruit Township Commune implemented the "Secretary Life Work Day" to ensure that party committee secretaries at all levels regularly go deep into the canteens, implement the Party's policies, mobilize the masses to run canteens well, promptly discover and resolve existing problems, and summarize a set of experiences for secretaries to go deep into the canteens and adhere to "Three Togethers" (eating the same food as the commune members at the same table, cooking with the cooks and taking stock, and managing grain and studying food arrangements with the administrators). Through "Three Togethers," the secretaries at all levels promptly discovered problems and mobilized the masses to pool their wisdom to run the canteens well. Liang Yugui, the second secretary of the commune party committee, went deep into the No. 1 canteen of the Bali Village Management District. After collecting opinions from the masses and mobilizing the cooks and administrators to contribute ideas, he created grain cards based on households, so that grain was used according to plan, and different types of grain were eaten in combination, which not only saved grain but also regularly changed the variety, so that the commune members ate economically, ate their fill, and ate well. Du An, the party branch secretary of the Zhongzhuang Production Team, went deep into the canteen and adhered to "Three Togethers," and found that the elderly and the young and strong ate the same food, which was difficult to chew. After mobilizing the masses to discuss, in addition to taking care of the elderly with some fine grains and more nutritious vegetables, the general cooking methods were processed more finely. For example, the rice was cooked softer and the vegetables were cut finer, etc., which the elderly were very satisfied with. With the implementation of the "Secretary Life Work Day," democratic management systems were generally established in the canteens, and the work of the canteens greatly improved.

Through the "Secretary Life Work Day," the secretaries at all levels promptly discovered problems, summarized experiences, and guided the overall situation. Jiang Zihe, the first secretary of the commune party committee, discovered that the Wuliying Production Team did not have a plan for grain use, and immediately helped the team hand over the grain "bottom" to the commune members, organized the commune members to discuss, and made a segmented grain use plan in accordance with the spirit of adjusting the intensity of agricultural work. A plan for grain use was arranged for the whole year. The commune party committee immediately promoted the experience of Wuliying, and all 237 canteens in the commune generally arranged grain use plans, which not only ensured that the commune members ate their fill and ate well, but also saved and reserved 1.8 million catties of grain throughout the year. Since the implementation of the "Secretary Life Work Day," the advanced experiences summarized and promoted by the secretaries at all levels, such as democratic management of canteens, large-scale family production, processing coarse grains into fine grains, saving grain, planning grain use, and reforming cooking utensils, have numbered twelve. Forty-two canteens, where the food was relatively monotonous, have become canteens with diverse food. More than 30 third-class canteens throughout the commune, with the specific help of the secretaries at all levels, have changed from backward to advanced, and the third-class canteens have now been eliminated. All 237 canteens in the commune not only strengthened the management of the original 3,100 mu of autumn vegetables, but also planted more than 2,100 mu of overwintering vegetables such as spinach and scallions. In addition, they raised more than 1,400 pigs and more than 5,100 chickens and rabbits, and many canteens set up their own sauce gardens.

In order to make the "Secretary Life Work Day" well integrated with the usual grasping of life, and to prevent the tendency of only grasping life during the "Secretary Life Work Day" and neglecting the usual grasping of life, and only grasping life and neglecting production during the "Secretary Life Work Day," the commune party committee adopted the "Listen," "Study," and "Determine" three-character work method. "Listen" means that before each week's life work day, the secretaries at all levels extensively listen to the opinions of the commune members on production and life, combined with going deep into the grassroots and participating in productive labor; "Study" means that the commune party committee studies the key points of grasping life based on the opinions heard from the masses, and makes unified arrangements. "Determine" means determining the key points and arranging which canteen to go to for the next "Life Work Day." This closely integrates grasping production and grasping life, and better expands the results of the "Secretary Life Work Day."

Since the implementation of the "Secretary Life Work Day," the Fruit Township Commune has ensured that the secretaries at all levels go deep into the front lines of life in a down-to-earth manner, participate in life, and lead life. This has led to a new situation of "three more, three less, and three fast." That is, there are more people going deep into the front lines of life, and fewer people walking around the canteen; there is more practical work, and less empty shouting; there are more specific ideas, and less general calls. Problems are discovered quickly, problems are solved quickly, and experiences are promoted quickly. Twelve red flag canteens, seven red flag kindergartens, one red flag nursery, and four advanced collective living units, and 222 model figures have emerged throughout the commune. This has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the service personnel on the life front and laid a good foundation for further improving the lives of the masses. Now, not only have the third-class canteens been eliminated throughout the commune, but family production has been universally carried out in the canteens of the commune, and more than 80% of the canteens have basically achieved self-sufficiency in non-staple foods, and often improve their meals. This has greatly mobilized and developed the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members. (Attached picture)

    运用“二五制”的领导方法创造经常抓生活的经验
    昌黎果乡公社建立“书记生活工作日”制度
    党委书记每周定期深入生活第一线，具体领导办好食堂，安排生活，促进生产
    本报讯　昌黎县果乡公社党委在大抓生活中，运用和发挥“二五制”的领导方法，实行“书记生活工作日”的制度。使抓生活的工作经常化、制度化。
    “书记生活工作日”是在推行“二五制”领导方法的基础上，两天上来学习、总结工作的制度不变，在五天的下乡工作中，以两天的时间（即每周的星期三、六两天），从公社党委第一书记到生产队的党支部书记，深入生活第一线进行工作。
    随着大办粮食、大抓生活工作的深入发展，果乡公社党委进一步认识到抓生活促生产的重要作用，并深深体会到经常全面细致地抓好生活，必须有一套相适应的工作方法。过去，有些党组织和干部抓生活只是一般的抓，不善于把抓生产和抓生活紧密结合起来。以致抓了生产，忽略了生活，或者是抓了生活，忘掉了生产。针对这种情况，公社党委认真经过讨论研究，并根据“二五制”的精神，通过解剖八里庄管理区各级党组织的书记深入食堂的典型，确定了实行“书记生活工作日”。
    食堂是安排好群众生活的中心。果乡公社实行“书记生活工作日”，保证了全社各级党委书记经常深入食堂，贯彻党的政策，发动群众办食堂，及时发现解决了存在的问题，并总结出了一套书记深入食堂坚持
  “三同”（与社员同桌吃一样的饭，与炊事员一同做饭，搞家底，与管理员一同管粮食和研究安排好伙食）经验。通过“三同”，各级书记及时发现问题，发动群众集思广益办好食堂。公社党委第二书记梁荫桂深入到八里庄管理区第一食堂，经过搜集群众意见，发动炊事员、管理员献计献策，创造了以户为单位的用粮卡片，做到计划用粮，实行不同粮种搭配吃用，既节约了粮食，又经常变换花样，社员吃得省，吃得饱，吃得好。中庄生产队支部书记杜安深入食堂坚持“三同”，发现老年人和青壮年吃一样的饭嚼不烂。经过发动群众讨论，除了照顾老年人一些细粮和营养比较丰富的蔬菜以外，在一般饭菜的做法上采取了加工细做的方法。例如饭煮的软些，菜切的细些等等，老年人非常满意。随着“书记生活工作日”的推行，各食堂普遍建立了民主管理制度，食堂工作大有起色。
    各级书记通过“书记生活工作日”，及时发现问题，总结经验，指导全面。公社党委第一书记江子贺发现五里营生产队用粮没有计划，立即帮助这个队把粮食“底”交给社员，组织社员讨论，根据农活轻重、忙闲调剂的精神，作出了分段用粮计划，安排了全年用粮计划。公社党委并立即推广了五里营的经验，全社二百三十七个食堂，普遍安排了用粮计划，不但保证了社员吃饱吃好，全年还可节约储备粮食一百八十万斤。自从实行“书记生活工作日”以来，由各级书记亲自总结推广的食堂民主管理、大搞家底生产、粗粮细作、节约用粮、计划用粮、炊具改革等先进经验就有十二项。使原来饭菜比较单调的四十二个食堂，一跃而为饭菜多样的食堂。全社三十多个三类食堂，在各级书记的具体帮助下，已经由落后变为先进，目前已经消灭了三类食堂。全社二百三十七个食堂，不仅将原有三千一百亩秋菜普遍加强了管理，而且种了菠菜、葱等越冬菜二千一百多亩。另外还养猪一千四百多口，养鸡、养兔五千一百多只，许多食堂办起了自己的酱园。
    为了作到“书记生活工作日”与平时抓生活很好结合，防止只在“书记生活工作日”抓生活，忽略平时抓生活和在“书记生活工作日”中只抓生活，忽略生产的偏向，公社党委采取了“听”、“研”、“定”三字工作法。“听”，就是各级书记在每周生活工作日以前，结合深入基层和生产劳动，广泛地听取社员群众对生产、生活方面的意见；“研”就是公社党委根据听到的群众意见，研究抓生活的重点，统一安排。“定”，就是确定重点，安排下一个“生活工作日”到那个食堂去。这样把抓生产和抓生活紧密结合起来，更好地扩大了“书记生活工作日”的成果。
    果乡公社实行“书记生活工作日”以来，保证了各级书记扎扎实实地深入生活第一线，参与生活，领导生活。从而出现了“三多、三少、三快”的新局面。即深入生活第一线的多了，绕着食堂走的少了；实干的多了，空喊的少了；具体出主意的多了，一般号召少了。发现问题快，解决问题快，推广经验快。全社涌现出十二个红旗食堂、七个红旗幼儿园、一个红旗托儿所和四个先进集体生活单位，二百二十二个标兵人物。从而大大鼓舞了生活战线服务人员的工作热情，为进一步搞好群众生活打下了良好的基础。现在全社不仅消灭了三类食堂，而且在全社的食堂中，普遍搞起了家底生产，80％以上的食堂基本做到副食品自给，经常改善伙食。大大调动和发挥了广大社员群众的生产积极性。（附图片）
