　　10,000 Teachers and Students Go to the Countryside

　　Over 10,000 teachers, students, and staff members from 14 universities and secondary vocational schools in Hunan Province have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production and have rushed to the forefront of agricultural production. During their time in the countryside, they will primarily participate in productive labor, combined with teaching and scientific research activities.

　　Bringing Technology Down, Bringing Experience Back

　　A group of science and technology personnel in Guangxi are going deep into the countryside to support agricultural production. Their slogan is: Bring technology down, bring experience back. Specific tasks include: (1) Helping to solve the technical problems of large-scale chlorella production; (2) Promoting linear programming to solve the problem of labor shortage; (3) Teaching steaming rice techniques to save fuel and improve canteen work.

　　Officers and Soldiers Establish Vegetable Growing Production Bases

　　Officers and soldiers of the leading organs of the Shandong Provincial Garrison are all participating in vigorously developing agriculture and planting vegetables. In production, they adopted a method of combining professional and amateur production and established seven production bases. During labor, the leaders of the garrison took the lead, and the officers and soldiers worked together. Major General He Zhucheng joined everyone in plowing the land and planting seeds. In July and August alone, he turned over 232 jin of vegetables to the canteen.

　　Medical Workers Settle Down in Canteens

　　In Gongxian County, Henan Province, 60% of the medical staff have settled down in rural canteens and are working with cooks to improve canteen hygiene. With their help, many canteens have ensured that they do not eat rotten vegetables, diseased and dead livestock meat, or cold rice, and do not drink raw water, ensuring strong soldiers and horses, and actively engaging in production. In addition, they are also striving to carry out disease prevention and control work, carrying medicine bags to work in the fields during the day, and using the canteen as a health room at night to treat villagers and publicize hygiene knowledge.

　　A Propaganda Team and a Production Team

　　"A propaganda team and a production team" is the fighting slogan of the Fuxian Ping Opera Troupe in Liaoning Province, serving agricultural production. Since the beginning of this year, they have gone deep into more than 2,000 production brigades and small teams, performing for more than 600,000 villagers. Two-thirds of the performed plays reflect the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and are combined with the current political struggle, encouraging the morale of the masses. In addition to performing, they also take time to participate in labor; during the busy production season, they work with the villagers to rush production. Some villagers said: The style of these actors is really like the People's Liberation Army.

　　Commune-level Party Organizations Hire "Advisors"

　　Cadres of the Guangping Commune in Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, generally hire "advisors." These advisors include elderly farmers and young and middle-aged farmers. They are all poor and lower-middle peasants, with rich experience and certain skills in production, and they also have a high prestige among the masses. In production, cadres at all levels take "advisors" as teachers and listen to their opinions with an open mind. In this way, the entire commune has formed a great situation in which everyone participates in production and manages production.

　　Lhasa Trains Teachers of 민ban Elementary Schools

　　Counties and districts under the jurisdiction of Lhasa City are using the autumn harvest holiday time to train teachers of 민ban elementary schools separately. The number of people participating in the study accounts for 64% of the total number of teachers. Through study, their political and professional levels have been improved to varying degrees, laying a good foundation for further implementation of the Party's education policy.
