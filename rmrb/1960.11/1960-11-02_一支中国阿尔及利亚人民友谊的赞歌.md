Ah! Great and strong People's China,
Ah! Great and strong People's China,
Ah! This loyal respect comes from Algeria,
Ah! This loyal respect comes from Algeria.
We are all fighting for happiness and freedom,
Our common enemy is imperialism,
The Chinese and Algerian people unite,
Oppose aggression until final victory.
Long live the People's China! Long live the People's China!

This song, "Ah! Great China," is sung to the Chinese people by Algerian artist Ahanmud Wahhabi of the visiting Algerian Art Troupe with his endless friendship. This song expresses the heartfelt wishes of friendship between the people of China and Algeria.

On the morning of September 29, Wahhabi, carrying his twelve-stringed琴, arrived in Beijing with his fellow members of the art troupe. The first step they took off the plane, their Chinese hosts welcomed them with enthusiastic greetings and flowers. Wahhabi thought: Isn't this just like Algerians welcoming their brothers? That afternoon, Wahhabi and his partners joined the people of the capital to welcome Abbas Ferhat, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, who was invited to visit. At that time, it was drizzling lightly, but the airport was still as lively as a boiling ocean, with red flags fluttering in the wind, gongs and drums resounding in the sky, and slogans and cheers forming a beautiful chorus.

All of this was reflected in Wahhabi's eyes, and his heart was like twelve琴strings playing together, the experiences of the Algerian people flashing through his mind. He thought, our representatives of the Algerian people are receiving such a grand reception here. The liberated Chinese people are truly great; they are our fighting brothers. Wahhabi was excited and thoughtful, and a song of praise for the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people was conceived in his heart. On the tenth day in China, on their way from Beijing to Nanjing, a kind and moving song came from the train carriage. This is "Ah! Great China."

The Algerian artists brought a song and dance drama called "Towards the Light" to the Chinese people. It tells the story of an Algerian patriotic youth who unfortunately falls into the hands of the French colonial army. This loyal son of the Algerian people endures cruel torture and torment but remains steadfast and unyielding. At the end of the play, there is a scene: the national flags of the People's Republic of Algeria and the People's Republic of China are hung side by side, and several heroic Algerians stand in front of the two national flags. At this time, the stage recites: "On November 1, 1954, the bell of liberation rang out on the African continent. Because the Algerian people have shown a strong will, and because of the strong support of friendly countries all over the world, today's bell is louder than yesterday." Then the song "Our Algeria" begins.

Since the song "Ah! Great China" was created, "Towards the Light" has had a new ending when it is performed in various parts of China. Following the song "Our Algeria," the song "Ah! Great China" is sung. The song praises the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people. The sound waves, filled with infinite affection, remain in the hearts of the Chinese people and will never fade away.

    一支中国阿尔及利亚人民友谊的赞歌
    新华社记者  汪波清
    啊！伟大坚强的人民中国，
    啊！伟大坚强的人民中国，
    啊！这忠诚的敬意来自阿尔及利亚，
    啊！这忠诚的敬意来自阿尔及利亚。
    我们都是为了幸福自由而战斗，
    我们的共同敌人是帝国主义，
    中阿人民团结起来，
    反对侵略直到最后胜利。
    人民中国万万岁！人民中国万万岁！
    这一支“啊！伟大的中国”的赞歌，是正在我国访问的阿尔及利亚艺术团的音乐家阿汗穆德·瓦哈比，用他的无尽的友情向中国人民唱出的。这支歌唱出了中阿两国人民友谊的心声。
    9月29日上午，瓦哈比带着他的十二弦琴，同艺术团的伙伴们来到了北京。当他们走下飞机后的第一步，中国主人们就用热情的问候和鲜花欢迎他们。瓦哈比心里想：难道这不正像阿尔及利亚人欢迎他的弟兄吗？当天下午，瓦哈比又同伙伴们，和首都各界人民一起来欢迎应邀来访的阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯·费尔哈特。那时间，天上不时下着蒙蒙细雨，可是飞机场上依然热闹得如同沸腾的海洋，风卷红旗飘，锣鼓喧天响，口号声、欢呼声，汇成了动听的大合唱。
    这一切映入瓦哈比的眼帘，他心头像十二根琴弦一齐弹奏起来，阿尔及利亚人民的遭遇一幕一幕地闪过脑际，他想，我们阿尔及利亚人民的代表在这里受到如此隆重的接待，解放了的中国人民真是太伟大了，他们是我们战斗的弟兄。瓦哈比激动着、思索着，一支中国阿尔及利亚人民友谊的赞歌，就这样在他的心里孕育起来。到中国的第十一天以后，在他们由北京前往南京访问的途中，火车车厢里发出了亲切的动人的歌声，这就是“啊！伟大的中国”。
    阿尔及利亚的艺术家们这次给中国人民带来了一个歌舞剧叫“向光明”，演的是一个阿尔及利亚爱国青年不幸落于法国殖民军队手中，这位阿尔及利亚人民忠实的儿子，经受了残酷的拷打和折磨，仍然坚定不屈。在剧的最后出现了这样一个场景：阿尔及利亚共和国和中华人民共和国的国旗并排高悬，几个英勇的阿尔及利亚人在两面国旗前站立起来。这时舞台上朗诵道：“1954年11月1日，非洲大陆响起了解放的钟声。由于阿尔及利亚人民表现了坚强意志，由于全世界友好国家的大力支援，今天的钟声比昨天更加嘹亮。”随之便响起了“我们的阿尔及利亚”的歌声。
    自从“啊！伟大的中国”这首歌产生以后，“向光明”在中国各地演出时，它结尾又有了新的处理。继“我们的阿尔及利亚”歌声之后，接着唱起“啊！伟大的中国”。歌声赞美中阿两国人民的战斗友谊，那寄予无限情意的声波，留在中国人民的心中，将永不消逝。
