    Fushoujing Commune Gives Play to the Fighting Role of Factory Party Branches

    (Our Dispatch) The Party branches of more than ten factories affiliated with the Fushoujing People's Commune in the Xicheng District of Beijing have fully exerted their role as fighting bastions in leading production and conducting political and ideological work, enabling these factories to be further consolidated and improved.

    The Fushoujing People's Commune Party Committee, since the establishment of the commune, has grasped the work of establishing grassroots Party organizations under the guidance of the thought that "politics is in command." On the one hand, the Party Committee transferred a group of Party members from the Xicheng District Committee's affiliated organs to strengthen the grassroots leadership force; on the other hand, during the construction of the commune, it absorbed a group of activists from the masses into the Party, and successively established Party branches in more than ten commune-run factories.

    The characteristic of the Party branches of each factory in leading production is that from the branch secretary to the branch committee members, they generally go deep into the workshops and teams, eating, working, and discussing with the production personnel. Wherever there are difficulties, the branch secretary appears to lead the production personnel to overcome the difficulties together. Some commune-run factory Party branches simply work in the workshop, living with the production personnel all day long. In this way, the grassroots organizations of the Party and the masses have established a close relationship, which not only facilitates a thorough grasp of the ideological situation of the masses, but also enables them to discover key problems in production at any time and solve them in a timely manner. Du Ying, the Party Branch Secretary of the "July 1st" Hat Factory of the Commune, took the lead in adhering to the system of management personnel participating in labor, making sure to go to the workshop every month to grasp the key points. Because she mastered production technology in labor and was familiar with the production situation of the production personnel, she strictly controlled the quality of products. She not only formed a factory-wide quality inspection team with the master craftsmen and production personnel, conducting two or three spot checks every month, but also focused on mobilizing the production personnel to check themselves and check each other, further improving the quality of the products.

### 福绥境公社发挥工厂党支部战斗作用

    福绥境公社发挥工厂党支部战斗作用
    本报讯　北京市西城区福绥境人民公社所属十多个工厂的党支部，在领导生产和进行政治思想工作中充分发挥了战斗堡垒作用，使这些工厂得到了进一步巩固和提高。
    福绥境人民公社党委从建社开始就在“政治是统帅”的思想指导下，抓紧建立基层党组织的工作。党委一方面从中共西城区委区属机关抽调一批党员充实党的基层领导力量；另一方面在建社过程中吸收一批群众中的积极分子入党，陆续在十多个社办工厂中建立起了党的支部。
    各厂党支部领导生产的特点是，从支部书记到支部委员一般都深入车间和小组，和生产人员同吃、同劳动、同商量。哪里有困难，支部书记就出现在哪里，领导生产人员共同克服困难。有的社办工厂党支部索性就在车间办公，整天和生产人员生活在一起。这样，使党的基层组织和群众建立起亲密无间的关系，既便于深入掌握群众的思想情况，又能随时发现生产中的关键问题，及时解决。公社“七一”制帽厂党支部书记杜英带头坚持管理人员参加劳动的制度，做到月月下车间抓关键。由于她在劳动中掌握生产技术，又熟悉生产人员的生产情况，狠狠把住了产品质量关。她不仅和老师傅、生产人员共同组成全厂质量检查组，每月进行两三次抽查，还着重发动生产人员自己检查和相互检查，进一步提高了产品的质量。
