Xinhua News Agency, November 1st—The China Political Science and Law Society held a banquet tonight to welcome all members of the legal worker delegations from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, who are visiting China.

These legal worker delegations from the three countries came to China for a visit after attending the Seventh Congress of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. In Beijing, they visited factories, schools, and rural people's communes, and some were invited to attend and observe the trials of some civil and criminal cases in Chinese courts. These dozens of legal workers hold different political views, but at the banquet, they unanimously praised the great achievements of the Chinese people over the past eleven years and congratulated the development of friendship between the Latin American people and the Chinese people.

Wu Defeng, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Society, extended a warm welcome to the guests from afar in his speech at the banquet, and warmly congratulated the development of friendship between Chinese and Latin American legal workers.

He said that the Chinese people, like the Latin American people, have long been subjected to imperialist oppression and exploitation. Now that the Chinese people have achieved victory, it is inseparable from international support.

Wu Defeng said that in recent years, the Latin American people have achieved a series of major victories in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, safeguarding national independence, and defending world peace.

Wu Defeng also said that safeguarding world peace, national independence, and people's rights is the glorious duty of our legal workers. He called on everyone to join hands and fight for a common cause.

Eduardo Salumón Wolkowicz, head of the Argentine legal workers delegation, said at the banquet that although the members of our delegation have different political ideas and viewpoints, all of us are impressed and admire the encouraging achievements made by your country.

This Argentine friend also said that the experience we have learned from China is useful to the Latin American people. We feel great sympathy for the Chinese people's desire for peace. He also believes that excluding the People's Republic of China from the United Nations is a blatant violation of international law principles.

José Dias Vieira, head of the Brazilian legal workers delegation, praised the great victory of the Chinese revolution in his speech, expressing his friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. He said that the revolution you have accomplished has made the Chinese people the most capable people in the world, realizing all the most daring imaginations.

Miguel González Castillo, head of the Chilean legal workers delegation, said at the banquet that our delegation has personally witnessed how the new China has stood up with incomparable perseverance. He mentioned the names of Chinese people familiar to the Chilean people—Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong. He said that he was filled with admiration and respect for them, especially today, when he saw that the people of this country had achieved great achievements. He wished that all evil things would no longer descend on the land of this country.

At the banquet, Shen Junru, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Society, and Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese-Latin American Friendship Association, toasted the guests successively, congratulating the deep friendship between the Chinese and Latin American people. Also present at today's banquet were Zhang Zhiran and Zhang Youyu, Vice Presidents of the China Political Science and Law Society, well-known figures in the Chinese legal community and people from all relevant fields, including: Ma Xiwu, Huang Huoxing, Wu Xinyu, Chen Qiyuan, Min Ganghou, Ke Bonian, Dong Chuncai, Zhou Erfu, Shen Zijiu, Cao Mengjun, Shen Jian, Wu Maosun, He Chengxiang, and others.

    中国政治法律学会举行宴会
    欢迎阿根廷、巴西、智利法律工作者
    据新华社1日讯　中国政治法律学会今晚举行宴会，欢迎来我国访问的阿根廷、巴西、智利三个法律工作者代表团全体成员。
    这三个国家的法律工作者代表团是在出席国际民主法律工作者协会第七届大会以后来中国访问的。他们在北京参观了工厂、学校和农村人民公社，有的应邀出席旁听了中国法庭对一些民事和刑事案件的审判。这数十位法律工作者有着不同的政治见解，但是他们在宴会上一致赞扬了中国人民十一年来的伟大成就，祝贺拉丁美洲人民同中国人民友谊的发展。
    中国政治法律学会副会长吴德峰在宴会上讲话时，向远道而来的客人表示热烈的欢迎，并且热烈祝贺中国和拉丁美洲法律工作者之间的友谊的发展。
    他说，中国人民和拉丁美洲人民一样，长期受着帝国主义的压迫和剥削。现在中国人民取得了胜利，这是同国际支援分不开的。
    吴德峰说，近几年来拉丁美洲人民在反对美帝国主义、维护民族独立、保卫世界和平的斗争中，取得了一系列重大的胜利。
    吴德峰还说，保卫世界和平、民族独立和人民权利，这是我们法律工作者的光荣职责。他呼吁大家携起手来，为共同的事业而奋斗。
    阿根廷法律工作者代表团团长爱德华多·萨路蒙·瓦尔斯基维尔在宴会上说，尽管我们代表团的成员是具有不同的政治思想观点，但是我们所有的人都对你们国家所取得的令人鼓舞的成就而感到钦佩。
    这位阿根廷的朋友还说，我们向中国吸取的经验，对拉丁美洲人民是有用的。我们对中国人民的渴望和平感到极大的同情心。他并且认为，把中华人民共和国排斥在联合国组织之外，是对国际法准则的横蛮的破坏。
    巴西法律工作者代表团团长若塞·迪亚贵阿尔·迪亚斯在讲话中赞美中国革命的伟大胜利，表达了他对中国人民的友好感情。他说，你们所完成的革命，使中国人民成为世界上最有能力的人民，实现了一切最大胆的想象。
    智利法律工作者代表团团长米格尔·冈萨雷斯·卡斯蒂略在宴会上说，我们代表团亲眼看到了新中国是怎样以无比坚强的毅力而站立起来了。他提到智利人民所熟悉的中国人的名字——孙逸仙和毛泽东，他说，他对他们本人充满了钦佩和敬仰，尤其在今天看到了这个国家的人民取得了伟大成就的时候，他祝愿一切邪恶的东西不再降临到这个国家的土地上。
    宴会上，中国政治法律学会副会长沈钧儒、中国拉丁美洲友好协会会长楚图南先后向客人们祝酒，祝贺中国和拉丁美洲人民的深厚友谊。出席今天宴会的还有中国政治法律学会副会长张志让、张友渔，中国的法律界著名人士和各有关方面的人士，他们当中有：马锡五、黄火星、武新宇、陈其瑗、闵刚侯、柯柏年、董纯才、周而复、沈兹九、曹孟君、申健、吴茂荪、何成湘等。
