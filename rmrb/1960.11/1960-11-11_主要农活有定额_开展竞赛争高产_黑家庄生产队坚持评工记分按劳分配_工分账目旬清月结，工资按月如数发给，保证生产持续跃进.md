Major Farm Work Has Quotas; Conduct Competitions to Strive for High Yields
Heijiazhuang Production Team Persists in Evaluating Work and Recording Points for Distribution According to Labor
Work Point Accounts are Cleared Every Ten Days and Settled Monthly, Wages are Paid in Full Every Month, Ensuring Continuous Leap Forward in Production
According to a report from the Henan Daily: The Heijiazhuang Production Team of the Renjiazhuang Production Brigade in the Liaohe Commune of Nanyang City, Henan Province, has consistently adhered to the system of evaluating work and recording points from the initial agricultural production cooperative to the present, which has powerfully promoted the continuous leap forward in various productions.

Continuously Improving the Evaluation of Work and Recording of Points
This production team, starting from the elementary cooperative in 1954, implemented the “fixed points and fixed recording” method commonly used by mutual aid groups at the time. Later, based on the opinions of the masses, it was changed to “fixed points and flexible evaluation.” This method was an improvement over the previous one, allowing members who were active in labor to earn more work points without being limited by the base score, thus greatly improving their enthusiasm for labor. However, in the implementation process, because there was no basis for the evaluation of work, some groups had high scores and some groups had low scores, and members still had opinions. After long-term exploration and learning from foreign experience, they proposed the method of "grading and setting quotas for farm work, and evaluating work and recording points according to quotas." This method was actively supported by the vast majority of cadres and members. Facts have proved that this method of evaluating work and recording points is fair, reasonable, and practical, effectively mobilizing the enthusiasm of members for labor.

The main basis for the Heijiazhuang Production Team to formulate the grading and quota for farm work is: First, divide the whole year's farm work into three seasons: busy, medium-busy, and slack, and determine different quota standards in different seasons. Second, the quota for each farm work is mainly determined based on the labor intensity, technical level, ease of operation, and labor force. Third, determine the quota based on the use of livestock and tools. For example, for plowing, the quota for a large ox is three and a half mu per day, with three points assigned per mu; the quota for a small ox is two and a half mu per day, with four points assigned per mu.

The method for determining the grading and quota for farm work is: First, for agricultural labor, according to the operation procedures of various crops from land preparation and sowing to harvesting and storage, formulate operation procedures and determine labor quotas for each item. Second, for basic construction, determine a labor quota or collective contracting quota for each project according to the task. Third, for miscellaneous tasks, according to the season and actual needs, stipulate the quantity and quality, and determine the quota. Fourth, for perennial fixed work, such as cooking and feeding, fix the perennial quota according to labor intensity, labor strength, technical level. After the quota for each work is determined, the evaluation of work and recording of points will be based on the labor quota completed by each member every day, and wages will be paid monthly according to the actual work points earned by the members, making the members' enthusiasm for labor higher and higher.

Regularly Supplement and Revise Quotas
With the development of production and the reform of production tools, especially after the communization, all aspects of production have made comprehensive leaps forward, production conditions have continued to change, and labor efficiency has continued to improve. The original labor quotas are no longer fully adapted and need to be supplemented and revised. In order to better implement the labor quota and the system of evaluating work and recording points, this production team regularly and comprehensively supplements and revises the labor quota for each farm work every year after the summer harvest and before planting wheat. Cadres use the method of participating (participating in labor, participating in the evaluation of work and recording of points), trying (labor quotas that are not easy to determine are determined by cadres through labor experiments and member research), and changing (labor quotas that are found to be unreasonable are modified at any time) to reasonably adjust labor quotas. For example, when sending base fertilizer to wheat fields this year, the original labor quota was one point for each cart of manure for nearby fields and one and a half points for each cart of manure for distant fields. Some cattlemen reflected that it was difficult to send manure to distant fields. The captain, Hei Fudao, worked as a cattleman for two days. As a result, he sent six carts of manure to distant fields and twelve carts of manure to nearby fields in one day. According to the original quota of work points, he would get twelve points a day for nearby fields and only nine points a day for distant fields. Therefore, the team committee and members studied and adjusted this labor quota, dividing the boundary between distant and nearby fields, and dividing the manure delivery quota into three categories: distant, nearby, and semi-distant, and determined different remunerations, which the cattlemen were very satisfied with. The same farm work also has different changes before and after, so it is necessary to adjust and determine different quotas according to the different situations before and after a farm work. For example, picking cotton, in the peak period of cotton boll opening and the late stage of picking, it is necessary to modify the farm work quota in a timely manner.

For members who break the quota due to tool reform, the team also stipulated a reward system. In addition to recording work points for the excess part as calculated, the team also rewarded 30% to 70% of the excess quota work points, according to the degree of improvement in work efficiency. In this way, the implementation of labor quotas and tool reform were combined.

In order to better adhere to the labor quota and the system of evaluating work and recording points, this production team also frequently implemented the method of contracting small sections of farm work. That is, the small section plan of farm work, labor quota, evaluation of work and recording of points, and labor organization are unified. The production team records accounts by section according to the quota, and the work points for each day of each section are recorded by the work group. The work group adopts the method of assigning work according to the person. For farm work suitable for collective contracting, collective contracting is implemented, and evaluation and scoring are done after completion. For those suitable for contracting by person, contracting by person within the group is implemented. Before completion, the team cadres and work group leaders will inspect and accept, and those who complete the quota will be issued tickets on the spot.

Labor Remuneration is Cashed One by One
In order to facilitate the verification of work points and workdays, the team has work point ledgers, work groups have work sheets, and members have work booklets. The production team adopts the method of clearing every ten days and settling monthly for work point clearing. Every ten days, the production team collects work tickets from the work groups. Members hand in work tickets and record work booklets, the work groups register work sheets, and the production team records work accounts. At the end of each month, it is announced to the members once. If the number of work booklets, work sheets, work accounts, and work tickets collected by the production team are all consistent, the work points for the previous month are cleared out before the 5th of each month, and wages are paid according to the actual workdays of each member. At the end of each month, while clearing and announcing the work point accounts, the number of attendance days, workdays, and wages paid for each member are also announced on the list. The members are generally satisfied.

An important reason why this team's system of evaluating work and recording points is well adhered to is that wages are paid monthly according to the actual workdays of each member.

Persist in Putting Politics in Command
In the process of implementing the system of evaluating work and recording points in the Heijiazhuang Production Team, the cadres of the production team conscientiously discussed the important significance of combining putting politics in command and material encouragement, and criticized the erroneous idea of ​​relying solely on the evaluation of work and recording of points and not paying attention to political and ideological education. In the implementation of the evaluation of work and recording of points, they persisted in putting politics in command: First, while carrying out the evaluation of work and recording of points, they mobilized members to carry out regular labor competitions, such as advanced quota competitions and quality first competitions; and persisted in regular political mobilization work in the production process. Second, they regularly conduct "three accounting" education for members (accounting for the relationship between completing the amount of farm work, ensuring the quality of farm work and comprehensively increasing production; accounting for the relationship between comprehensive production increase and more work and more income according to labor distribution; accounting for the relationship between the good or bad collective production and the actual labor day value), so that members can clarify the correct relationship between the personal interests of earning more work points and the interests of the collective and the country, and improve the socialist consciousness of the vast members. Third, in the process of adhering to the evaluation of work and recording of points, they let the members know why it is meaningful to complete this section of farm work and how to complete this section of farm work task for each section of farm work arrangement and contracting; so that each member knows what kind of labor attitude he should use to complete this section of farm work contracting task, and put the adherence to the system of evaluating work and recording points on the basis of doing a good job in comprehensive production increase and increasing the income of the commune and members, and truly achieve the correct combination of putting politics in command and material encouragement, and promote the continuous leap forward in production.

    主要农活有定额　开展竞赛争高产
    黑家庄生产队坚持评工记分按劳分配
    工分账目旬清月结，工资按月如数发给，保证生产持续跃进
    据河南日报消息　河南南阳市潦河公社任家庄生产大队黑家庄生产队，从初级农业生产合作社到现在，一直坚持评工记分制度，有力地促进了各项生产的持续跃进。
    不断改进评工记分
    这个生产队从1954年初级社开始，实行了当时互助组通用的“死分死记”办法，后来根据群众意见改为“死分活评”。这种办法较前一种有了改进，使劳动积极的社员，能够不受底分限制多得工分，劳动积极性因此大大提高。但是在执行中，由于评工没有依据，有的组评分高，有的组评分低，社员仍有意见。在长期的摸索和学习外地经验后，他们又提出了“农活分级定额，按定额评工记分”的办法。这个办法，受到绝大多数干部和社员积极拥护。事实证明，这种评工记分的办法，既公平合理，又切实可行，有效地调动了社员的劳动积极性。
    黑家庄生产队制订农活分级定额的主要依据是：一，把全年的农活分为大忙、中忙和农闲三个季节，在不同季节里确定不同定额标准。二，每项农活的定额，主要是根据各种农活的轻重、技术高低、操作难易等情况和劳动力情况确定的。三，根据使用牲畜和工具的情况，确定定额。如犁地，大牛每天定额三亩半，每亩订三分，小牛每天定额二亩半，每亩订四分。
    确定农活分级定额的方法是：一，对农业用工，按照各种作物从整地、播种到收打入仓的每个环节，订出操作规程，逐项确定劳动定额。二，对基本建设，分别工程项目，按任务确定一个劳动力定额或集体包工定额。三，对杂务活，根据季节和实际需要，规定数量、质量，确定定额。四，对常年固定的活，如炊事工作、饲养工作等，按照劳动强度和劳动力强弱、技术高低，固定常年定额。各项活路的定额确定后，评工记分就按每个社员每天完成的劳动定额情况记分，每月按社员实得工分发给工资，使社员的劳动积极性越来越高。
    经常充实修订定额
    随着生产的发展和生产工具的改革，特别是公社化后各项生产全面跃进，生产条件不断变化，劳动效率不断提高，原来的劳动定额已不尽适应，需要进行充实和修订。为了更好地执行劳动定额和评工记分制度，这个生产队每年夏收后种麦前，定期全面充实和修订各项农活劳动定额，干部通过参（参加劳动，参加评工记分）、试（不易确定的农活定额，经干部劳动试验和社员研究确定）、改（发现劳动定额不合理的随时修改）的办法，合理地调整劳动定额。如今年往麦田送底肥时，原来的劳动定额是近地每车粪一分，远地每车粪一分半。有些牛把式反映往远地送粪费劲大。队长黑付道就当了两天牛把式，结果远地一天送粪六车，近地一天送十二车，按原来定额工分，近地一天得十二分，远地一天只得九分。于是队委会和社员研究，调整了这项劳动定额，划分了远近地的界限，将送粪定额分为远地、近地、半远地三类，确定了不同的报酬，牛把式都很满意。同是一项农活，先后也有不同的变化，所以也必须根据一项农活前后不同的情况，调整确定不同的定额。如摘棉花，在棉花吐絮盛期和采摘后期，就需要及时修改农活定额。
    由于改革工具而突破定额的社员，这个队还规定了奖励制度。突破了定额，除超额部分照数记工分外，根据提高工效的程度，分别奖励超定额数的30％到70％的工分。这样就把实行劳动定额和工具改革结合了起来。
    为了更好地坚持劳动定额和评工记分制度，这个生产队还经常实行了小段农活包工的办法。就是把农活小段计划、劳动定额、评工记分、劳动组织四者统一起来，生产队分段按定额记账，每段每天的工分由作业组去记。作业组采取因人派活的方法，对适合于集体包工的农活，集体包工，完成后评议记分。对适合按人包工的，实行组内按人包工。完工前由队干部和作业组长验收，完成定额者当场发票。
    劳动报酬逐一兑现
    为了便于核实工分和劳动日，这个队设有记工账簿，作业组有工表，社员有工折。生产队对工分清理，采取旬清月结的方法，每十天生产队向作业组收一次工票。社员交工票、记工折，作业组登记工表，生产队记工账。每月月终向社员公布一次，工折、工表、工账和生产队收起的工票数都相符者，每月5日前对上个月工分清理出来，按每个社员实做劳动日发给工资。每月月终在清理公布工分账的同时，都列榜公布每个社员出勤天数、劳动日数、发工资数。社员普遍满意。
    这个队评工记分制度坚持得好的一个重要原因是，按每个社员实做劳动日按月发工资。
      坚持政治挂帅
    黑家庄生产队在执行评工记分制度当中，生产队的干部认真讨论了政治挂帅和物质鼓励相结合的重要意义，批判了单纯依靠评工记分，不注意政治思想教育的错误思想。在执行评工记分中坚持了政治挂帅：一，在进行评工记分的同时，发动社员开展经常性的劳动竞赛，如先进定额竞赛，质量第一竞赛；在生产过程中坚持经常的政治鼓动工作。二，经常向社员进行“三算账”的教育（完成农活数量、保证农活质量与全面增产的关系账；全面增产和多劳多得按劳分配的关系账；集体生产搞的好坏与实际劳动日值的关系账），使社员弄清多挣工分的个人利益和集体、国家利益的正确关系，提高了广大社员的社会主义觉悟。三，在坚持评工记分的过程中，对每段农活的安排和包工，都让社员知道为什么要完成这段农活意义，以及怎样完成这段农活任务；使每个社员知道应该以什么样的劳动态度去完成这段农活包工任务，把坚持评工记分制度建立在为搞好全面增产、增加公社和社员收入的思想基础上，真正达到了政治挂帅和物质鼓励正确结合起来，促进生产持续跃进。（附图片）
