Promote the True Qualities of the Working People, Persist in Participating in and Leading Production
Cadres of All Ethnic Groups Take Root and Blossom on the Front Lines of Production

(Our Dispatch) Cadres of all ethnic groups in the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have taken root and blossomed on the front lines of production, becoming the backbone for leading the broad masses of commune members in developing production.

The Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture is a region primarily focused on animal husbandry, with a small proportion of agricultural areas, and a short history of agricultural management in some pastoral areas. Many Kirghiz herders, who have lived a nomadic life for generations, are tilling the land and planting crops for the first time this year. In order to help them master and improve agricultural cultivation techniques as quickly as possible, cadres of all ethnic groups first became shock troops in learning advanced production experiences and leaders in reforming agricultural production techniques. The Third Brigade of the Bostan Teerek Commune in Wuqia County planned to sow 5,200 mu of winter wheat this year, but the cattle and horses, long accustomed to grazing, did not understand commands and could not be used to plow the fields. The deputy brigade leader, Aimuzha (Kirghiz), took the lead in learning to train the cattle, and in three days, he had tamed more than ten cattle to work in the fields. Under his influence and with his help, the entire brigade trained more than forty draught animals, greatly accelerating the sowing progress. By October 15th, they had overfulfilled the task. Because cadres of all ethnic groups took the lead in learning, diligently studying, and quickly teaching what they learned to the broad masses, although the county's summer harvest area this year was more than doubled compared to last year, the task was completed half a month ahead of schedule. The autumn sowing area was expanded by 60% compared to last year, and the sowing period was shortened by about ten days.

The vast number of pastoral area cadres active on the thousands of miles of grassland move with the herds year-round, eating, living, laboring, and discussing matters with the herders, and are known by the herders as intimate secretaries and livestock-loving captains. Aimaiti (Kirghiz), the deputy director of the Heiziwei Commune, spent 95% of his time on the pasture this year. He knew everything about the nearly one hundred herds in the commune, including the number of livestock in each herd, their condition, and the work of the herders. He traveled all over the commune's pastures, arranging grazing areas for the livestock from spring to summer, ensuring that the herds were transferred in a planned manner and had suitable grazing locations, reducing the mortality rate of the commune's livestock from an average of twenty heads per month last summer to one and a half heads this year. In early September, the alpine pastures experienced three consecutive days of heavy snow, and the temperature suddenly dropped below zero. He inspected the herds day and night, leading the herders to care for the livestock, so that not a single sheep was lost.

Cadres of all ethnic groups have demonstrated the true qualities of the working people, who are not afraid of hardship or difficulty and are diligent and conscientious, on the front lines of production, becoming close friends of the broad masses of commune members. Comrade Keke Libaosake (Kirghiz), the magistrate of Aktao County, has been stationed in the Third Management Area of the Yumai Commune this year. During the summer harvest, he found that the threshing progress of the First Brigade was very slow because it had not organized a specialized threshing team and had not utilized the evening wind for threshing. He immediately helped them organize a specialized team and ate, lived, labored with the team members, enabling the brigade to complete the summer grain harvest nine days earlier than last year. Under his leadership, the previously backward management area won the red flag of excellence twice in the autumn sowing work. Two hundred and ninety-two county-level cadres in Aktao County who went to the countryside implemented a system of serving as administrators or cooks for one day every half month, personally cooking or clearing accounts. In response to the situation that the canteens did not raise chickens and ducks, and the commune members were not accustomed to and rarely ate vegetables, they paid special attention to the production of non-staple foods in the canteens. Under their vigorous publicity and personal help, the county's four hundred and eleven canteens planted a total of 6,359 mu of vegetables, raised 4,507 chickens, and each canteen had a certain number of dairy cows and sheep.

Cadres of all ethnic groups participating in production and leading production on the front lines has become an established system. According to the vast area of the autonomous prefecture, the "fourteen-one" system has been widely implemented, that is: ten days of participating in labor production, four days of meetings to study work, and one day of rest with the commune members. State-level leading cadres of the autonomous prefecture work at the grassroots level for six months a year, county-level leading cadres for eight months, and commune-level leading cadres work at the grassroots level all year round. Even clerks and accountants, whose daily affairs are very cumbersome, can take some time to participate in production. (Liang Mingda) (Attached Images)

    发扬劳动人民本色　坚持参加生产领导生产
    各族干部在生产第一线生根开花
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州各族干部，在生产第一线生根开花，成为领导广大社员发展生产的骨干力量。
    克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州是一个以牧业为主的地区，农业区比重小，部分牧区经营农业的历史很短。许多世代逐水草而居的柯尔克孜族牧民，今年还是第一次荷锄扶犁种庄稼。为了尽快地帮助他们掌握和提高农业耕作技术，各族干部首先就成为学习先进生产经验的突击手和改革农业生产技术的带头人。乌恰县波斯坦铁列克公社的第三大队，今年计划播种五千二百亩冬麦，但是长期放牧的生牛生马，不懂号子，不能下田犁地，这个大队的副大队长埃木扎（柯族）便带头学习训练耕牛，在三天时间，就使十多条牛驯服地下田耕地。全大队在他的影响和帮助下，共训练出耕畜四十多条，大大加快了播种进度，到10月15日便超额完成了任务。由于各族干部处处带头学习，刻苦钻研，并把学到的东西迅速教给广大群众，虽然今年全县的夏收面积比去年扩大了一倍多，也提前半月完成了任务，秋种面积比去年扩大了60％，播种期缩短了十天左右。
    活跃在千里草原上的广大牧区干部，常年随畜群转移，和牧民同吃同住同劳动同商量，被牧民称为知心书记和爱畜队长。黑孜苇公社副社长艾买提（柯族），今年95％的时间都在牧场上，全社近一百个畜群每群牲畜多少、膘情肥瘦和放牧人员的工作情况，他都了若指掌，他踏遍了全社各个牧场，从春到夏为牲畜安排草场，作到畜群有计划地转移，并得到合适的牧放场所，使全社牲畜死亡率由去年夏季每月平均二十头降低到今年的一头半。9月初高山牧场一连下了三天大雪，气温突然下降到零度以下，他日夜巡查畜群，领导牧民护理牲畜，使羊群一只也未受损失。
    各族干部在生产第一线上表现出不怕艰苦，不怕困难，勤勤恳恳的劳动人民本色，成为广大社员的知心朋友。阿克陶县县长科克里包萨克同志（柯族），今年一直在玉麦公社第三管理区蹲点。在夏收中，他发现一大队扬场进度很慢，原因是未组织扬场专业小组，也未利用晚风扬场，他立即帮助他们把专业小组组织起来，并和组员们同吃同住同劳动，使这个队夏粮收获比去年提前九天地净场光。这个原来工作比较落后的管理区，在他的领导下，秋播工作连获两次优胜红旗。阿克陶县上山下乡的二百九十二名县级干部，实行每人每半月当一天管理员或炊事员，亲自做饭或清理账目。他们针对食堂未养鸡鸭、社员不习惯和很少吃菜的情况，特别抓紧食堂副食品生产。在他们大力宣传和亲自动手帮助下，全县四百十一个食堂共种菜六千三百五十九亩，养鸡四千五百零七只，每个食堂都有一定数量的奶牛和羊只。
    各族干部在第一线参加生产领导生产已形成制度。根据自治州地区辽阔的特点，各地普遍推行了“十四一”制，即：十天参加劳动生产，四天开会研究工作学习，一天和社员一起休息。自治州州级领导干部一年有六个月、县级领导干部有八个月、公社级领导干部一年四季都在基层工作。连日常事务非常繁琐的文书、会计，也能抽出一定时间参加生产。（梁鸣达）（附图片）
