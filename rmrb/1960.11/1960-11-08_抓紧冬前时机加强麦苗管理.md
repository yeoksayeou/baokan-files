    Seize the Opportunity Before Winter to Strengthen Wheat Seedling Management

    Thoroughly Irrigate the First Watering of Winter Wheat
    The Seilibuya Commune in Bachu County, Xinjiang, is one step ahead and striving for progress at every step. After completing the winter wheat sowing task, they organized labor to repair canals and river embankments early, increased the water volume, and tried every means to conserve water and rush to irrigate winter wheat.
    In order to rationally and fully utilize water sources and thoroughly irrigate the first watering of winter wheat, the commune adopted measures to classify and rank the management areas according to soil conditions, and water them separately and successively. During winter irrigation, in addition to the production teams organizing watering professional teams to water day and night in shifts, party organizations at all levels also assigned special personnel to focus on water conservancy, ensuring that not a drop of water is wasted, and irrigating the winter wheat well.

    Eradicate Wheat Rust Before Overwintering
    The Xunyi Commune Party Committee in Bin County, Shaanxi Province, has sown more than 210,000 mu of wheat, which is generally growing well. However, due to recent continuous cloudy and rainy weather, rust has appeared in individual wheat fields.
    In addition to requiring close attention to every detail and early treatment, the commune party committee has also established a rust disease fixed-point forecasting team and set up aerial traps. Each production team has designated special personnel to be responsible for forecasting work. Now, various localities are taking measures such as burying soil and cutting leaves and spraying lime-sulfur mixture to prevent and control rust diseases.

    Prepare Tools for Winter Irrigation of Wheat Fields
    The Zhaobao Commune Party Committee in Qinyang County, Henan Province, conducted a major inspection, repair, and complete set of water lifting tools in the entire commune, preparing tools for winter irrigation of wheat fields.
    More than 26,000 mu of wheat fields in Zhaobao Commune are located in the Qingfengling area, which is most prone to drought. In previous winter irrigations, there was often a phenomenon that water lifting tools could not keep up with demand. This year, while the commune's party committee basically completed the wheat planting task, it specifically deployed the inspection, repair, and matching of winter irrigation machinery, and formed a mobile inspection and repair team.

    Organize Professional Teams to Manage Wheat After Previous Crop
    The Party Committee of the Kaishan Satellite Commune in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, earnestly summarized the experience of the Beiyukou Management Area, where this year's wheat achieved high yields due to early and good management, and organized professional teams to manage wheat after previous crop as early as possible.
    In specific management, "Five Universal" management measures were adopted. The Five Universals are: universal seedling inspection and replanting; universal topdressing; universal pest control; universal rolling; and universal watering for overwintering.
    Currently, the number of laborers invested in wheat field management in the entire commune has reached more than 650. According to incomplete statistics from the Kaishan, Wenyi, and Wuling Management Areas, in addition to replanting more than 180 mu of wheat fields with missing seedlings, more than 378 mu of wheat have been topdressed, and 697 mu have been treated for pests.

    Five Management Methods for Alkaline Land Wheat Fields
    The Xiji Commune in Guan County, Shandong Province, starts managing alkaline land wheat as early as possible based on the characteristics of alkaline land.
    This commune planted 25,000 mu of alkaline land wheat this year. After inspection, 1,500 mu had relatively serious missing seedlings, broken ridges, and insect pests. In response to this situation, the following alkaline land wheat seedling protection methods are adopted: (1) Apply more organic fertilizer and phosphorus and potassium fertilizer; (2) Water in advance to reduce the salt content of the topsoil; (3) To prevent soil hardening, always keep the ground loose; (4) Before freezing, use a short-toothed harrow to rake it once, which can loosen the soil, retain water, and retain fertilizer; (5) Prevent and control diseases and insect pests.

    Establish a Three-Wheat Management Archive System
    The Malou Commune in Fengxian County, Jiangsu Province, vigorously grasps the field management of three-wheat seedlings. By the beginning of this month, more than 30,000 mu have been inspected and replanted, accounting for more than 60% of the total wheat field area of the entire commune.
    Combining seedling inspection and replanting, the Malou Commune measures land and verifies the area of ​​the three wheats. At the same time, it fills in cards with the location, area, soil, variety, seeding amount, fertilization level, and current seedling growth status of each three-wheat plot, establishing a set of scientific archive system for three-wheat field management.

    Spring Crop Management Tasks Arranged to Groups
    The Fourth Production Team of the Chijiang Management Area of ​​Panjiang Commune in Yiliang County, Yunnan, arranged spring crop processing and management tasks to the work groups, arranging labor to plant and manage at the same time.
    As soon as autumn sowing ended, the Fourth Production Team comprehensively carried out spring crop field management work. Activities such as interplanting rapeseed, weeding wheat, and covering broad beans with manure started together. The production team contracted the processing and management tasks to the various fixed work groups throughout the year, establishing a production responsibility system with quantitative, qualitative, timely, and scoring requirements, and contracting management from now until the spring crops are mature. Due to clear division of labor and clear responsibilities, the enthusiasm of the commune members is very high, and the original labor quotas have been exceeded. The planned six days for weeding the wheat were completed in four days.

    抓紧冬前时机加强麦苗管理
    灌好灌足冬麦第一水
    新疆巴楚县色力布亚公社一步赶先，步步争先，在完成冬麦播种任务后，组织劳力及早整修渠道河坝，增加了水量，并千方百计节约用水，抢灌冬麦。
    为了合理地充分利用水源，灌好灌足冬麦第一水，公社根据各管理区土质情况，采取了分类排队，分别先后浇水的措施。冬灌中，除生产队组织浇水专业队日夜轮班浇水外，各级党组织还分别抽出专人抓水利，保证不浪费一滴水，灌好冬麦。
    把麦锈病消灭在越冬前
    陕西省邠县栒邑公社党委已播种小麦二十一万多亩，目前一般生长良好。但因最近阴雨连绵，个别麦田出现锈病。
    公社党委除了要求关关扣紧、一环不松，株株俱到，治早治了以外；并且建立了锈病定点测报小组、设立了空中捕捉器，各生产队都已指定专人担任测报工作。现在各地正采取埋土切叶和喷洒石灰硫磺合剂等防治锈病。
    为麦田冬灌准备工具
    河南沁阳县赵堡公社党委对全社提水工具，进行了大检查、大修理和大配套，为麦田冬浇作好了工具准备。
    赵堡公社有两万六千余亩麦田处在最易发生干旱的清风岭地区，历年冬浇中，往往出现提水工具赶不上需要的现象。今年公社的党委在种麦任务基本完成的同时，就具体部署了冬浇机具的检修和配套问题，并组成了流动检查修配组。
    组织专业队管理回茬麦
    山西文水县开栅卫星公社党委会，认真总结了北峪口管理区今年小麦由于管理得早，管理得好，从而获得丰产的经验，组织专业队伍，及早管理回茬麦。
    在具体管理中，采用了“五普”管理措施。五普是：普查苗补种；普追肥；普治虫；普镇压；普浇越冬水。
    眼下，全社投入麦田管理的劳力达六百五十余人，据开栅、文倚、武陵三个管理区不完全统计，除已给一百八十余亩缺苗麦田进行补种外，还给三百七十八亩小麦追了肥，并给六百九十七亩治了虫。
    管理碱地麦田五项办法
    山东省冠县辛集公社根据碱地特点，及早动手管理碱地小麦。
    这个公社今年种碱地麦二万五千亩，经检查有一千五百亩有比较严重的缺苗断垅和虫害现象。针对这一情况，采取以下几条碱地小麦保苗的办法：（1）多施有机肥料和磷钾肥；（2）提前浇水，降低土壤表层的含盐量；（3）为防止土壤板结，经常保持地面疏松；（4）封冻前利用短齿耙普耙一遍，能疏松土壤，保水、保肥；（5）防治病虫害。
      建立三麦管理档案制
    江苏丰县马楼公社狠抓三麦幼苗田间管理，到本月初，经过查苗补种的已达三万余亩，占全公社麦田总面积的60％以上。
    马楼公社结合查苗补种，进行丈量土地，核实三麦面积，同时把每一块三麦座落、面积、土壤、品种、播种量、施肥水平和当前幼苗长势填入卡片，为三麦田间管理建立一套科学的档案制度。
    小春管理任务安排到组
    云南宜良县盘江公社赤江管理区第四生产队把小春加工管理任务安排到作业组，安排劳动力边种边管。
    秋种刚结束，第四生产队就全面开展了小春田间管理工作。间油菜、锄小麦和给蚕豆盖粪等活动一齐开始。生产队把加工管理任务包给各常年固定作业小组，建立定量、定质、定时、定分的生产责任制，从现在一直包管理到小春成熟。由于分工明确，职责分明，社员积极性很高，原订劳动定额都被突破，锄头道小麦原计划六天完成，结果四天就完成了。
