    The Tool Section of the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant has established a used tool repair station. They collect the dulled and damaged tools from various workshops, repair them, and then increase their hardness to become high-quality new tools. Workers at the repair station are repairing inserted tooth milling cutters.
