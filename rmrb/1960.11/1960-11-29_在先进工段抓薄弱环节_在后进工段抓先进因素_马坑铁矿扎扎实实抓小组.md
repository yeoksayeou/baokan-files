    In Advanced Work Sections, Grasp Weak Links; In Backward Work Sections, Seize Advanced Factors
    Makeng Iron Mine Solidly Grasps Work Groups

    (Our report) Fuzhou, Fujian Province. The Makeng Iron Mine Party Committee in Longyan County implements a scientific leadership method of "grasping weak links in advanced work sections and seizing advanced factors in backward work sections," promoting the continuous deepening of the increase production and practice economy movement, and causing ore production to rise steadily.

    After carefully studying the experience of the Bijie Prefectural Committee in Guizhou Province of "grasping weak links in advanced areas and seizing advanced factors in backward areas," the Makeng Iron Mine Party Committee made a comprehensive analysis of the situation of each work section and group in the mine. They found that in the advanced production unit, the First Work Section, some cadres had developed complacency because they had completed their production tasks relatively well. They could not see the weak links existing in production, and their output fluctuated in September, affecting the continuous, balanced, and high output of the entire work section. At the same time, the cadres of the Second Work Section, which had a poorer record in completing production plans, also neglected the positive factors hidden among the workers and overemphasized objective difficulties, which also affected the improvement of production. In response to the different situations in these two work sections, the mine Party Committee decided that the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee would go deep into the grassroots level and use the advanced experience of grasping both ends to lead the middle, and solidly solve the problems.

    Mao Shufang, Deputy Secretary of the Mine Party Committee, went to the advanced unit, the First Work Section. First, she helped the cadres of the work section and team find the two main reasons for the unstable output: one was that some cadres had developed complacency and neglected to solidly grasp the key to production; the other was that they had neglected technological innovation. In response to these problems, a meeting of cadres, Party members, League members, and activists was immediately convened. On the basis of affirming the achievements, they identified problems, found key issues, and tapped potential. After the meeting, Ai Jinde, a member of the youth shock brigade, immediately led all the members to formulate a combat plan and carry out tool reform on a large scale. Soon, they created loading and unloading tools such as mobile platform automatic soil loading machines, which rapidly increased the work efficiency of the entire team by about 50%. At this time, Mao Shufang discovered that the Third Group of this advanced work section was still a backward unit and had failed to complete its plan for several consecutive months. So he went with Chen Xiuxian, the Party Branch Secretary of the work section, to this group to help the group leader improve his leadership style. After hard work and clever work, the whole group's production outlook changed greatly, catching up with the advanced level with a remarkable achievement of completing the monthly plan by 49%.

    During this period, after Ma Yongwang, Secretary of the Mine Party Committee, went deep into the backward unit, the Second Work Section, he found that although the production plan of this work section was not completed well enough, some groups had overfulfilled the production tasks month after month. He carefully summarized the experience of these groups, and then launched the entire work section to learn and promote the experience of these groups. With role models, the groups' confidence was enhanced. On the basis of conducting extensive ideological mobilization, a labor competition was launched, enabling the entire work section to overfulfill the production plan.

    After grasping both ends in this way, the Mine Party Committee reached a conclusion: an important key to achieving sustained leap-forward production lies in solidly grasping the work of the work groups. Therefore, the Mine Party Committee transferred twelve cadres from various departments to work sections and groups to further strengthen the grassroots leadership.

    在先进工段抓薄弱环节　在后进工段抓先进因素
    马坑铁矿扎扎实实抓小组
    本报讯　福建省龙岩马坑铁矿党委实行“在先进工段抓薄弱环节，在后进工段抓先进因素”的科学领导方法，促使增产节约运动步步深入，矿石产量节节上升。
    马坑铁矿领导干部在认真学习了贵州毕节地委“在先进地区抓薄弱环节，在后进地区抓先进因素”的经验后，矿党委对全矿各个工段、小组的情况作了全面分析，发现先进生产单位第一工段由于生产任务完成得比较好，个别干部产生了自满情绪，看不到生产中存在的薄弱环节，进入9月份产量忽高忽低，影响全工段持续均衡高产。在这同时，生产计划完成较差的单位第二工段的干部，也由于忽视了蕴藏在职工中的积极因素，过多地强调客观困难，也影响了生产的提高。矿党委针对这两个工段的不同情况，决定由党委正副书记分头深入基层采用抓两头带中间的先进经验，扎扎实实地解决问题。
    矿党委副书记毛淑芳下到先进单位第一工段以后，首先帮助工段、班组干部找到产量不稳定的两个主要原因：一是某些干部滋长了自满情绪，忽视扎扎实实的抓生产关键；一是忽视了技术革新。针对这些问题，立即召集干部、党团员、积极分子开会，在肯定成绩的基础上，摆问题、找关键、挖潜力。会后，青年突击队队员艾金德立即带动全体队员订出战斗计划，大搞工具改革。接着很快就制成了活动平台自动装土机等装卸工具，使全队工效迅速提高50％左右。这时，毛淑芳又发现了这个先进工段的第三小组仍然是个后进的单位，连续几个月没有完成计划。于是他就同工段党支部书记陈秀贤一道深入这个小组，帮助小组长改进领导作风。经过苦干巧干，全组生产面貌大改变，以超额49％完成月计划的显著成绩，赶上了先进水平。
    在这期间，矿党委书记马永旺深入到后进单位第二工段以后，发现这个工段虽然生产计划完成不够好，但有个别小组却月月超额完成生产任务，他仔细总结了这些小组的经验，接着就发动全工段学习推广这些小组的经验，各组有了榜样，信心增强了，在广泛进行思想动员的基础上，开展劳动竞赛，使整个工段超额完成了生产计划。
    经过这样抓两头以后，矿党委得出一条结论：实现生产持续跃进的一个重要关键在于扎扎实实地抓好小组工作。于是，矿党委又从各科室抽调十二个干部下放到工段、小组，进一步加强了基层领导力量。
