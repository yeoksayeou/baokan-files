    Rails on Wooden Boats
    I had heard a long time ago that Qijiang County's "rail boats" were doing well. Recently, I had the opportunity to see them in person, and they certainly lived up to their reputation.
    On a clear day, several wooden boats loaded with ore cars sailed towards the dock. As soon as the boats docked, the boatmen skillfully set up the gangplanks, held onto the ore cars on the boats with both hands, and with a whoosh, pushed the ore cars, one after another, onto the riverbank, where they slid away along the rails on the riverbank. It only took four boatmen thirty-five minutes to unload twenty-eight ore cars, thirty-five tons of ore. One boatman explained to us with a smile, "In the past, it would have taken thirty-two people ten hours to do the same job!"
    Installing rails on boats is an innovation by the boatmen. It can reduce loading and unloading procedures, and it can also start and stop, just like rails on land.
    Now Qijiang County has manufactured a large number of rail boats. Through these "rail boats," the rail networks of riverside docks, factories, and mines are connected with the earthen derricks and other transportation tools, forming a one-stop transportation system for roads, factories, stations, and ports.

    木船上的轨道
    早就听说綦江县的“轨道船”搞得不错，最近有机会亲自去看了一下，果然名不虚传。
    一个晴朗的日子，几只载满斗车的木船向码头驶过来。船一靠岸，船工们就熟练地搭起跳板，双手扶住船上的斗车，呼噜一声，就将一车一车的矿石推上了河岸，沿着河岸上的轨道滑走了。只花三十五分钟四个船工便将二十八个斗车三十五吨矿石卸完了。一个船工笑盈盈地向我们解释道：“在过去，要三十二个人花十个钟头才能干完呢！”
    把轨道安装在船上，这是船工们的一项革新。它可以减少装卸手续，又可行车、停车，和陆地上的轨道作用相同。
    现在綦江县已经制造了大批的轨道船，通过“轨道船”，把沿河码头、厂矿的轨道网、土吊杆和其它运输工具衔接起来，形成路厂、路站、路港的一条龙运输。
