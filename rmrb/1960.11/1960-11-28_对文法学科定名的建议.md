Suggestions on Naming the Discipline of Grammar

    The Wenhui Daily published an article on November 25, 1960, written jointly by Chen Wangdao, Wu Wenqi, and Deng Mingyi, titled "The Evolution of the Names 'Wenfa' and 'Yufa' and Our Suggestions on Naming the Discipline of Grammar." The article puts forward suggestions on naming the discipline of grammar.
    The discipline of "grammar" (文法) has not yet been uniformly named. In addition to the common names "wenfa" (文法) and "yufa" (语法), there have also been wentong (文通), wenpu (文谱), wenze (文则), and wenlü (文律). There are different views in academic circles regarding the usage of the common terms "wenfa" (文法) and "yufa" (语法). These views can be summarized into four categories: advocating the use of "wenfa" (文法) to encompass "yufa" (语法); advocating the use of "yufa" (语法) to encompass "wenfa" (文法); advocating the separate use of the two terms, calling the grammar of classical Chinese "wenfa" (文法) and the grammar of vernacular Chinese "yufa" (语法); and regarding "wenfa" (文法) and "yufa" (语法) as terms used in different periods before and after the May Fourth Movement.
    In the article, Chen Wangdao and others examined the evolution of the names "wenfa" (文法) and "yufa" (语法), and suggested adopting "wenfa" (文法) as the official name or correct name of the discipline of grammar. Their main reasons are: historically, "wenfa" (文法) has generally been the official name, with wenlü (文律), wenze (文则), yufa (语法), etc. being alternative names; "wenfa" (文法) has a relatively clear and concise meaning, and its rhetorical function is also relatively strong, allowing for various metaphorical usages.

### 对文法学科定名的建议

    对文法学科定名的建议
    1960年11月25日文汇报上，发表了陈望道、吴文祺、邓明以三人合写的文章《“文法”“语法”名义的演变和我们对文法学科定名的建议》一文，文中对文法学科的定名提出建议。
    “文法”这个学科至今还没有统一的定名，除了常见的“文法”、“语法”两个名称之外，还有过文通、文谱、文则、文律等。而对于常见的“文法”和“语法”两个词的用法，学术界又有不同的主张。这种主张归纳起来有四种，即：主张用“文法”统括“语法”；主张用“语法”统括“文法”；主张两个术语分用，把文言文的文法称“文法”，白话文法称“语法”；以及把“文法”和“语法”看作是“五四”前后不同时期的用语。
    陈望道等在文章中，考证了“文法”和“语法”名义的演变，建议采用“文法”作为文法学科的定名或正名。他们的主要理由是：历史上一般都以“文法”为正名，以文律、文则、语法等为别名；“文法”含义比较明确、简括，修辞的功能也比较强，可以作种种譬喻用法。
