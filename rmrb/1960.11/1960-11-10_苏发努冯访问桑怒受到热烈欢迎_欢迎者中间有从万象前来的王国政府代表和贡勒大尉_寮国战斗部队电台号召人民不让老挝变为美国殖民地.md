Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 9th – According to a broadcast today by the Pathet Lao Radio, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, visited Sam Neua city on the 7th. He received an enthusiastic welcome from the local people.

Accompanying Souphanouvong were Sithon Kommadam, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front.

When Souphanouvong and his party arrived in Sam Neua city on the morning of the 7th, more than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Sam Neua, dressed in festive attire and holding colored flags, stood on both sides of the road to welcome them.

Also present to welcome Prince Souphanouvong were Khouanine Pholsena, Minister of Propaganda and representative of the Lao Kingdom government, who arrived in Sam Neua from Vientiane on the 6th, Captain Kong Le, Chairman of the coup d'état committee, as well as Lao Patriotic Front leaders Kaysone Phomvihane, Chao Sopsaisana and Sisavat Keobounphan, and the Vice Governor of Sam Neua Province, Thaoma.

Prince Souphanouvong warmly greeted the cheering crowds, praised the spirit of unity of the people of Sam Neua, and thanked them for their warm welcome.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 9th – Pathet Lao Radio published a commentary on the 8th, calling on the Lao people never to let historical tragedies be repeated.

The commentary reviewed that in the past three years, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have undermined the Vientiane Agreement, suppressed the Lao Patriotic Front and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, launched a civil war, and attempted to turn Laos into a new type of colony of U.S. imperialism, causing great suffering to the Lao people and seriously threatening the fate of the Lao nation.

The commentary continued, the Lao people will never forget these painful historical lessons, but now, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are trying to make history repeat itself.

The commentary exposed that "U.S. imperialism is doing everything possible to put pressure on the Phouma government, undermining negotiations, and plotting to restore the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, in order to turn Laos into a new type of American colony and a war base. U.S. imperialism has also instigated the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique to attack the Kingdom's armed forces and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, forcing the Kingdom government to accept its lackeys to participate in the leadership of the government and the army.”

The commentary said, “Faced with these conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, the Lao people cannot help but doubt: If U.S. imperialism is still allowed to interfere in Laos by using ‘aid’, if reactionaries are still allowed to participate in the coalition government, can Laos completely get rid of the crisis?"

The commentary concluded, "The Lao people have experienced a long and arduous struggle and learned countless profound lessons. They will never allow historical tragedies to be repeated in Laos."

    新华社河内9日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王在7日访问桑怒市。他在那里受到当地人民的热烈欢迎。
    随同苏发努冯访问的有老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席西吞·库马丹。
    当苏发努冯一行在7日晨到达桑怒市时，穿着节日盛装的桑怒市各阶层人民三千多人，手拿彩色旗帜，站在道路两旁欢迎他们。
    前往欢迎苏发努冯亲王的还有6日从万象来到桑怒的老挝王国政府的代表、宣传部大臣贵宁·奔舍那和政变委员会主席贡勒大尉，以及老挝爱国战线党领导人凯山、昭苏和西萨瓦特，桑怒省副省长陶马。
    苏发努冯亲王向欢呼的人群亲切地问候，并赞扬桑怒人民的团结精神，感谢人民对他的热情欢迎。
  新华社河内9日电　寮国战斗部队电台8日发表述评，号召老挝人民决不要让历史悲剧重演。
    述评回顾说，美帝国主义及其走狗在过去的三年中破坏万象协议，镇压老挝爱国战线党和寮国战斗部队，发动内战，企图变老挝为美帝国主义的新型殖民地，使老挝人民遭受极大苦难，使老挝民族的命运受到严重威胁。
    述评接着说，老挝人民永远也不会忘记这些惨痛的历史教训，但是，现在美帝国主义及其走狗却企图使历史重演。
    述评揭露，“美帝国主义千方百计地向富马政府施加压力，破坏谈判，阴谋促使富米·诺萨万叛国集团复辟，以便把老挝变成美国的新型殖民地和战争基地。美帝国主义还唆使富米·诺萨万叛国集团进攻王国军队和寮国战斗部队，迫使王国政府接受它的走狗参加政府和军队的领导。”
    述评说，“面对着美帝国主义及其走狗的这些阴谋，老挝人民不能不怀疑：如果仍然让美帝国主义利用‘援助’来干涉老挝，如果仍然让反动派参加联合政府，那么，老挝能够彻底摆脱危机吗？”
    述评最后说，“老挝人民经历了长期艰苦的斗争，吸取了无数沉重的教训，他们决不容许历史悲剧再次在老挝重演。”
