Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 28th. Chongqing's light industrial departments have been conducting in-depth investigations and research on the usage effects of their products, continuously strengthening political and ideological work and technical management, leading to a continuous improvement in the quality of light industrial products. Since the third quarter of this year, the city's first-class product rate for twenty-five major products, including cotton yarn, cotton cloth, machine-made paper, has increased, and more than 3,000 new designs and varieties have been added.

In order to further meet the needs of the people, Chongqing's light industrial departments have, since the third quarter, visited users to solicit opinions on light industrial products. They have also organized inspection teams in eight industries, including cotton spinning, knitting, cultural and educational supplies, rubber, leather, and glass, to visit factories to understand and help solve key problems in further improving product quality. During the inspection of the Chongqing Leather Factory, the leather roving inspection team, together with the factory's Party committee and workers, changed the large-scale assembly line production to small-scale assembly line production and strictly implemented the sanitation system. After more than eighty experiments, a chemical preparation was made, which greatly improved the quality of leather, and the variety of leather shoes also increased to more than a hundred kinds.

In the process of improving product quality, the light industrial factories have also particularly strengthened technical management. The methods they have adopted are: first, to strictly control the quality inspection from raw materials and semi-finished products to finished products warehousing; second, to strictly implement operating procedures and sanitation systems, and to continuously summarize and promote advanced operating experience; and third, to strengthen the maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment. Chongqing Silk Spinning Factory employees strictly implemented operating procedures in production, strengthened equipment maintenance and repair, and earnestly promoted the advanced experience of "double flame singeing" and "rapid degumming," which made the luster and color of silk more beautiful, and all reached the first-class level. Chongqing 601 Paper Mill thoroughly overhauled machinery and equipment, strengthened process management, classified and managed bamboo and grass fiber raw materials, used them in proportion, formulated cutting standards, and strictly implemented various sanitation systems, which improved the whiteness of the paper, making the first-class product rate of paper reach 95%. According to the opinions of the masses, Chongqing Enamel Factory vigorously promoted advanced operating experiences such as burning high temperatures with pulverized coal and staggered cleaning of furnaces in sections, which made the first-class product rate of enamel products such as washbasins and mouth cups increase by 20% compared with the original, and the porcelain powder was fine, glossy, beautiful and durable, reaching the national advanced level.

    调查使用效果　加强技术管理
    重庆轻工业产品质量不断提高
    三季度来，棉纱、棉布、机制纸等二十五种主要产品提高了一等品率，增加了花色品种三千多种。
    新华社重庆28日电　重庆市轻工业部门深入调查研究产品使用效果，不断加强政治思想工作和技术管理，使轻工业产品质量不断提高。今年三季度以来，全市棉纱、棉衣、精粗纺毛织品、棉毛衫裤、绢丝、袜子、皮革、机制纸、金笔、搪瓷、热水瓶、手风琴等二十五种主要产品的一等品率、合格率分别比原来提高5％到30％左右；有些产品的质量已经赶上了全国先进水平。在提高产品质量同时，全市轻工业产品的花色品种也由去年的一千多种增加到四千种以上。
    为了进一步满足人民的需要，重庆市轻工业部门从第三季度以来，一方面访问用户，征求对轻工业产品的意见，一方面组织了棉纺、针织、文教、橡胶、皮革、玻璃等八个行业的检查组，到各厂了解和帮助解决进一步提高产品质量的关键问题。皮革巡回检查组到重庆皮革厂检查中，和厂党委、工人群众一起把大流水生产改为小流水生产，严格贯彻执行清洁卫生制度，经过八十多次试验，制成一种化学制剂，大大提高了皮革的质量，皮鞋的花色品种也增加到百种以上。
    各轻工业工厂在提高产品质量中，还特别加强了技术管理。他们采取的办法是：第一，从原料、半成品到成品入库，层层把关，严格进行质量检查；第二，严格贯彻操作规程和清洁制度，不断总结和推广先进操作经验；第三，加强机器设备的维护检修工作。重庆丝纺厂职工在生产中严格贯彻执行操作规程，加强设备的维护修理，认真推广“双火头烧毛”和
  “快速脱胶”的先进经验，使绢丝的光泽和颜色都更美好，全部达到了一等品。重庆六○一造纸厂彻底检修了机器设备，加强工艺管理，分类管理竹草纤维原料，按比例搭配使用，制订切剪标准，严格执行各种清洁制度，提高了纸张的白净度，使纸张的一等品率达到95％。重庆搪瓷厂根据群众意见，大力推行了末煤烧高温、分段交叉清炉等先进操作经验，使面盆、口杯等瓷品的一等品率比原来提高20％，瓷粉细致光泽，美观耐用，达到了全国先进水平。
