Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 26th – This year, Lhasa City's handicraft workers have produced over a thousand kinds of new products. Among these are over three hundred types of agricultural implements, including threshing machines, windmills, new-style walking plows, mowers, and seeding drills, as well as various types of clothing and handicrafts.

These products were all previously unproduced in Tibet. Due to the unprecedented surge in workers' enthusiasm for production after the democratic reforms, and under the leadership of the Party, workers boldly experimented. With the help of Han Chinese technical workers, they finally succeeded in trial manufacturing.

Lhasa's handicraft industry, which was on the verge of collapse under the feudal serf system, has experienced significant development under the care and support of the Party and the People's Government. The working conditions and economic lives of handicraft workers have also been improved. The government has also established collective welfare facilities such as nurseries, barbershops, and bathhouses for handicraft workers. Currently, 96% of handicraft workers have joined handicraft production mutual aid teams.

    拉萨手工业工人制成千余种新产品
    脱粒机、新式步犁、割草机等农具已能制造
    新华社拉萨26日电  拉萨市手工业工人今年已经制成一千多种新产品。其中有脱粒机、风车、新式步犁、割草机、播种耧等三百多种农具，还有各式服装，以及各种手工艺品等。
    这些产品都是过去西藏没有生产过的，由于民主改革后工人们生产积极性空前高涨，在党的领导下，大胆试制，加上汉族技术工人的帮助，终于先后试制成功。
    在封建农奴制度下原已奄奄一息的拉萨手工业，在党和人民政府的关怀扶持下，生产有了很大发展，手工业工人的劳动条件和经济生活也都得到了改善。政府还为手工业工人兴办了托儿所、理发馆、洗澡堂等集体福利事业。目前，96％的手工业者已经参加了手工业生产互助组。
