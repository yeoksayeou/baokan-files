Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 25th: Gansu is seizing the opportunity to carry out winter irrigation. Winter irrigation of winter wheat fields and spring sowing fields throughout the province has reached more than 4,190,000 mu, accounting for 44% of the province's land requiring winter irrigation. Jingyuan County's winter irrigation area has reached 53% of the land requiring winter irrigation.

In order to expand the winter irrigation area and improve the quality of winter irrigation, various regions have made full use of all water conservancy facilities and water lifting equipment, and have focused on repairing existing reservoirs, ponds, dams, kilns, wells, springs and other water conservancy facilities. At the same time, in combination with plowing and leveling the land, branch and capillary canals, field ridges, etc. were built to make the projects complete and generate better benefits. Jingchuan County has repaired more than 7,400 canals and leveled more than 140,000 mu of land. The Jingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China focused on small-scale channel and capillary channel supporting projects that save labor, are effective, and are simple and easy to implement. In areas with sufficient water sources, branch canals are connected to every piece of land to supply water; in areas where surface water is scarce but groundwater is abundant, wells are dug to draw water for irrigation, maximizing the irrigated area. Various regions have also actively improved irrigation systems and strengthened technical guidance for irrigation. In areas with abundant water sources and wide canals, measures are taken to increase the amount of water diverted and irrigate multiple points simultaneously; in areas with insufficient water sources, small amounts are concentrated and then released in large quantities for centralized rotational irrigation, in order to save water, labor, and time.

During winter irrigation, leadership departments at all levels dispatched a large number of water conservancy technicians to key irrigation areas to guide irrigation, and communes also actively trained winter irrigation technicians and invited experienced farmers to serve as advisors, providing on-site guidance to ensure the quality of winter irrigation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, 25th: Various areas of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are seizing the current opportunity of night freezes and daytime thaws to intensify winter irrigation. As of November 20, nearly half of the stubble land in the region that needs winter irrigation had been irrigated.

This year, the planned winter irrigation area in the Ningxia Yellow River Irrigation Area is more than 3 million mu, and the water demand is greater than last year. In order to ensure that winter irrigation work is carried out quickly and well, Party committees at all levels first strengthened their leadership over winter irrigation work. Secretaries personally took charge, and each commune established winter irrigation headquarters with production teams as units, and production teams established winter irrigation work groups to specifically arrange the order and progress of winter irrigation and inspect the quality of winter irrigation. Before the start of winter irrigation, various regions generally organized cadres to conduct a comprehensive inspection of branch canals, capillary canals, ditch canals and the progress of plowing, and universally widened and deepened some old branch canals that were unfavorable to irrigation, speeding up the flow rate and increasing the amount of water entering. At the same time, based on the distribution of canals, the stubble land plowing and winter irrigation sequence were arranged, sections were divided, and labor and animal power were concentrated to launch surprise attacks on stubble turning, ensuring that the stubble land was irrigated in time after plowing. Many production teams' winter irrigation groups also implemented a responsibility system that specifies land plots, progress, and quality, implementing all winter irrigation work.

During winter irrigation, people's communes in various regions have adopted a "four firsts and four lasts" method according to local conditions: irrigate high fields first, then low fields; irrigate summer stubble fields first, then autumn stubble fields; irrigate sandy soil fields first, then loess fields; irrigate downstream fields first, then upstream fields, in order to avoid dispersing water power, affecting quality, and prolonging winter irrigation time. In addition, various regions have also adopted a method of combining plowing and winter irrigation, unifying scheduling, plowing one piece and irrigating one piece, plowing and irrigating at the same time, greatly accelerating the progress of winter irrigation, based on the current characteristics of intertwined agricultural tasks.

    未雨绸缪预防春旱　夜冻日消时机有利
    甘肃宁夏加紧冬灌
    新华社兰州25日电　甘肃各地抓紧时机开展冬灌工作，全省冬灌的冬麦地和春播地已达四百一十九万余亩，占全省需冬灌土地的44％。靖远县冬灌面积已达需冬灌土地的53％。
    为了扩大冬灌面积和提高冬灌质量，各地充分地利用了一切水利设施和提水机具，并重点地修葺了现有库、塘、坝、窑、井、泉等水利；同时，结合翻地平整土地，修建支、毛渠，畦埂等，使工程配套，更好地发生效益。泾川县已整修渠道七千四百多条，平整土地十四万多亩。中共靖远县委狠抓省工、收效大、简而易行的小型渠道及毛支渠的配套工程。在水源充分地区，做到块块有支渠通水；在地面水缺乏，地下水充足的地区，掏泉挖井，引水灌溉，尽量扩大灌溉面积。各地还积极改进灌溉制度，加强灌溉技术指导。水源丰富、渠道宽敞的地区，采取加大引水量，多点同时灌溉；水源不足的地区采取小聚大放，集中轮灌，以节约水量、劳动力和时间。
    冬灌中，各级领导部门抽派了大批水利技术干部，下到重点灌区指导灌溉，各公社也积极培训冬灌技术人员，并请老农当参谋，进行现场指导，保证了冬灌质量。
    新华社银川25日电　宁夏回族自治区各地抓紧当前夜冻日消的时机，加紧进行冬灌工作。截至11月20日为止，全区已有近半数需冬灌的茬地灌上了冬水。
    今年宁夏黄河灌区计划冬灌面积达三百多万亩，需水量比去年增大，为了保证冬灌工作进行得又快、又好，各级党委首先加强了对冬灌工作的领导，书记亲自上阵，各公社以生产队为单位成立了冬灌指挥所、生产小队成立了冬灌工作组，具体安排冬灌次序、进度，检查冬灌质量。在冬灌开始前，各地就普遍组织干部对支渠、毛渠、斗渠和翻地进度进行了一次全面检查，对一些不利灌溉的旧支渠，普遍进行开宽、挖深，加快流速，加大进水量。同时根据渠道分布情况，对茬地翻犁和冬灌次序进行了排队，划分段落，集中劳力和畜力突击翻茬，保证茬地在翻耕后按时灌上冬水。很多生产小队的冬灌小组，又实行定地块、定进度、定质量的责任制度，把全部冬灌工作落实下来。
    冬灌中，各地人民公社都因地制宜，采取了“四先四后”的办法：先灌高田，后灌低田；先灌夏茬田，后灌秋茬田；先灌沙土质田，后灌黄土田；先灌下游田，后灌上游田，以免分散水力、影响质量和拖长冬灌时间。此外，各地还根据当前农活交错的特点，实行翻地和冬灌相结合的办法，统一排队，翻一片灌一片，随翻随灌，大大加快了冬灌进度。（附图片）
