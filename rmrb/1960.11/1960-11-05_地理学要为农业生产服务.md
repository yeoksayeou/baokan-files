Geography Must Serve Agricultural Production
Li Bingshu, Deputy Director of the Institute of Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, under the leadership of the Party, the nation's geography workers have resolutely implemented the policy of serving socialist construction with science, closely linked with production practice, relied on the masses, and have done much work in transforming nature, comprehensively utilizing natural resources, regional economic development, and production layout. They have accumulated a large amount of scientific data and put forward beneficial scientific arguments, making contributions to socialist construction. In the process of geography serving socialist construction, various laboratories were established indoors, and positioning and semi-positioning observation stations were established in the field. The scientific analysis method combining qualitative and quantitative analysis was further applied, and modern scientific and technological knowledge such as physical chemistry was used. It began to break away from the backward state of simple description, giving this science a new look. This is a victory for the Party's policy of developing science.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor, giving priority to the development of heavy industry combined with the rapid development of agriculture, as well as the instruction that the whole Party should be mobilized and the whole people should act to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. This has played and will continue to play a great guiding role in China's socialist construction. The policy of taking agriculture as the foundation has put forward arduous, urgent, and glorious tasks for geographical science, making geography workers more clear about the direction of their efforts. At the same time, it has given geographical science new vitality, opening up a vast research field for geographical science.

Geography Has Much to Offer in Serving Agricultural Production

Geography has developed in the process of the working people fighting against nature and further understanding, utilizing, and transforming nature. Therefore, geography has always had a close connection with agricultural production. Geographers can pay more attention to the principle of adapting to local conditions when dealing with the above problems. Geographers have a lot to offer in serving agricultural production. We know that the most important object of agricultural production is crops, and the natural factors that affect the growth and development of crops are complex and multifaceted. Some of these factors cannot be controlled or completely controlled by human power at present. In order to develop agriculture, it is necessary to make full use of favorable conditions and transform unfavorable conditions. For example, the average annual rainfall in North China is 400-600 mm, which can meet the needs of crop growth from the whole year, but due to the uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall, there is spring drought and autumn waterlogging. If water conservancy projects are built to store the surplus rainwater in summer and autumn and use it in accordance with the time, the yield of crops can be greatly increased. The accumulated temperature in the Beijing area can meet the needs of two crops a year of grain crops, but due to the short-term invasion of early and late frosts, there is no guarantee for two crops a year. If artificial methods are used to control (such as irrigation, smoking, warm-bed seedling cultivation, etc.) to prevent and reduce the harm of early and late frosts that occur once, two crops can be harvested in a year. China has a vast territory and complex natural conditions, including the equatorial zone, tropical zone, subtropical zone, warm temperate zone, temperate zone, cold temperate zone, humid zone, semi-humid zone, arid zone, semi-arid zone, vast plains, the highest mountains, the largest plateaus, as well as widely distributed hills, basins, and deserts. Any measures taken to utilize, control, and transform nature for the development of agriculture must be based on the characteristics of different regions, adapt to local conditions, and find better and more economical methods. This often requires a more comprehensive understanding of the various related natural conditions and analysis of the interrelationships between these conditions. To carry out these tasks, geographers can just show their talents. Because the most important content of physical geography is to study the distribution and change of water, heat, land and biological resources, from the study of individual factors to the comprehensive study of the interrelationships between different factors, from understanding them to utilizing, controlling, and transforming them. The main task of economic geography is to conduct technical and economic evaluation of natural resources and measures to utilize and transform nature, and to study the rational layout of production. All these aspects of work are closely related to agricultural production and can and should contribute to agricultural development.

The Harvests Already Obtained and the Work Still to Be Done

Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture. China is a region of monsoon activity, with great changes in rainfall and great threats of drought and flood. In arid and semi-arid areas, the focus should be on expanding water sources and saving water; in humid and semi-humid areas, in addition to focusing on controlling floods and combating waterlogging disasters, attention should be paid to regulating the seasonal and multi-year imbalance of water volume. In the past few years, geographers, together with other scientific workers, have made many contributions in this regard. For example, we comprehensively investigated and analyzed the natural factors of soil erosion in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and on the basis of summarizing the experience of the masses, we proposed and implemented the comprehensive management policy of top-down, both slope and gully consideration, and the combination of biological measures and engineering measures, which effectively prevented soil erosion and greatly increased agricultural output. We helped the masses to melt ice and snow in the Qilian Mountains and Tianshan Mountains, solving the irrigation water for some farmland. We have also carried out work to prevent water evaporation, understand the origin and development of various water sources, and propose solutions to the imbalance between water supply and demand, so as to rationalize and save the existing water sources to the greatest extent. In addition, the prevention of wind and sand hazards to crops, the search for groundwater, the selection of reservoir sites, the small-scale flood forecasting and prevention, the transformation of depressions, the layout of river networks and drainage and irrigation systems, and the improvement of irrigation systems all require the application of geographical knowledge and geographical methods in accordance with local conditions, and geographers have participated in these. Of course, according to the needs of objective reality, geographers are still doing very little in these aspects, and they should play a greater role in the future. In particular, the study of the laws of monsoon activity, water balance, comprehensive utilization of water resources, and prediction of possible changes in natural conditions after the realization of water conservancy needs to be greatly strengthened. This will not only have significant practical significance for agricultural production, but also have long-term significance.

It is very important to increase agricultural production by overcoming the adverse effects of climate and hydrology on farmland and controlling and regulating the natural conditions for crop growth. For example, although early and late frosts occur for a short time, they are very harmful to crops, and can greatly reduce crop yields in severe cases. In production practice, rich experience has been accumulated in frost prevention. The current problem is to further grasp the law of frost occurrence and propose more economical and effective prevention methods. Studying the farmland microclimate and agricultural hydrological conditions suitable for rapid growth and high yield of different crops, and finding effective ways to control and utilize these conditions can promote the transformation of low-yield crops into high-yield crops, and high-yield crops into higher-yield crops. For example, in the case of high wheat yield, the most suitable sowing time and corresponding field management measures can be proposed by studying the microclimate and agricultural hydrological conditions of wheat growth and development. According to the comprehensive study of natural and economic conditions in various regions, especially water and heat conditions, relevant scientific basis can be put forward for the rational distribution of crops and cropping systems in areas where one crop is harvested a year to two crops a year or two crops in three years. In addition, a large number of searches for suitable terrain and microclimate conditions, using artificial control of microclimate methods, to expand the planting area of tropical crops to meet the needs of national economic development should also continue to be carried out vigorously.

While giving full play to the fertility of existing cultivated land, actively expanding the area of cultivated land is an important measure to develop agriculture. China's existing cultivated land accounts for about one-eighth of the country's total land area, and there are still vast land resources that need to be more effectively developed and utilized, including a large area of reclaimable wasteland. In order to rapidly develop and utilize these wastelands, it is necessary to find out the distribution, quality, favorable and unfavorable conditions of the wastelands, and propose ways and measures for transformation and utilization. In order to complete this task more, faster, better, and more economically, it is necessary to mobilize the masses on a large scale to conduct a widespread survey of wastelands, and at the same time promote the comprehensive utilization of aerial photographs and compile distribution maps and evaluation maps of various land resources.

In order to effectively promote the comprehensive development of people's commune production and the comprehensive leap forward of the economy, in the past three years, geography workers have gone deep into more than 100 communes in 19 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Under the leadership of the commune party committee, according to the needs of the national economy, the characteristics of the commune's natural conditions, and the original economic foundation, they have formulated comprehensive production development plans, clarified the direction of commune production development, the focus and scale of production development at each stage, the rational layout of production, and the arrangements for labor, investment, and related guarantee measures. Geography workers should further deepen their work in this area on the basis of their existing work, especially focusing on solving the key problems existing in current production, such as the establishment of large-scale high-yield bases and commodity production bases, the rational utilization of land, the rational layout of cultivated areas, farms, drainage and irrigation systems, roads, and residential areas, the rational organization and deployment of labor, and the comprehensive study of the relevant conditions for promoting the rapid realization of agricultural mechanization.

In addition, the comprehensive survey of large areas, agricultural planning and regionalization, the rational utilization of agricultural climate resources, and special studies related to agricultural production are all important tasks that must be continued.

Make Greater Efforts for the Vigorous Development of Agriculture and Grain Production

Through eleven years of work practice, geography workers have gained a rich harvest in terms of serving production, especially in serving agriculture and developing their own disciplines, both in work and in ideology. We have not only clarified the direction, but also explored the development path of this science. In practical work, we have the following experiences.

First, the geographical science work, under the leadership of the Party, resolutely implements the Party's policy of scientific research serving socialist construction and the method of task-driven discipline, which is the basic key to ensuring the victorious completion of national tasks and the rapid development of this discipline. The process of implementing the policy of science serving production and the method of task-driven discipline is essentially a process of long-term and repeated struggle between two roads in scientific work. The practice of geographical work also fully proves this point. Therefore, consolidating the idea of science serving socialist construction and further eliminating the remnants of bourgeois ideology and the tendency to engage in science for the sake of science and to separate from production practice has become the primary task of geography workers at present.

Second, socialist production practice requires that geography can not only point out the long-term direction and provide scientific basis for production development, but also solve the relevant specific problems in the current vigorous development of agriculture and grain production. This requires geography workers to resolutely and bravely throw themselves into the forefront of agricultural production and solve the specific problems related to geography in agricultural production. For example, the Jilin Province Ji'an County Geographical Society mobilized members to study the microclimate of Ji'an, and according to the accumulated temperature, initially solved the problem of rice and wheat intercropping in the county, which was valued by the county party committee. Geography workers must thoroughly reform their working methods, arm themselves with new knowledge and new technologies, dare to break the old "framework" of geography, and take the initiative to work together with relevant sciences to solve production practice problems, and also resolutely overcome the nostalgic thinking when encountering difficulties in the process of innovation. Whether or not we can resolutely innovate and actively learn new technologies is also a question of whether or not we want to revolutionize and dare to revolutionize in scientific development. Therefore, in the future work, we must better implement Chairman Mao's idea of despising difficulties strategically and paying attention to difficulties tactically, establish the style of learning and working hard while doing, and establish unwavering confidence and determination, and conscientiously solve practical problems for agricultural production, enrich our disciplines, and creatively develop new disciplines.

Third, in order for geography to effectively serve production practice and develop rapidly, it must be based on a broad mass base. The relationship between science and production is the relationship between theory and practice. Science and theory both come from production practice. Science serves production mainly by promoting research results into production and guiding production practice; science is a means, building socialism, building modern industry, modern agriculture, and developing production are the goals. Means must serve the ends, so scientific work must be closely integrated with production. Whether or not geography workers can follow the mass line and rely on the masses is a prerequisite for serving production practice. Farmers have accumulated extremely rich experience in the long process of understanding nature, transforming and utilizing nature, and developing production. We must humbly learn from the masses and be good at learning from the masses. We must go deep into the communes, stay in touch for a long time, and solve the agricultural production problems related to geography with them. Through practice, we should sum up their valuable experience into theory and then use it to guide production practice and further serve agricultural production. For example, Jilin geography workers learned from Comrade Dai Xilu of Liaoyuan People's Commune's experience in governing mountains and water in Dajia Mountain, and helped to summarize and propose the method of "focusing on storage, focusing on slope management, overall planning, and comprehensive management", which greatly developed Dajia Mountain agriculture and became a good place where "bald mountains become green hills, muddy water does not see clear water, and grain and melons are harvested in abundance." Only theories like this can be easily mastered by the masses and better guide production practice, so that geography can take root and blossom among the masses, thus consolidating the foundation for the development of this discipline.

Fourth, the specific problems raised in production practice are often not solved satisfactorily by any one discipline. Similarly, the problems in agricultural production are also comprehensive and closely related to the natural conditions of a certain area. The comprehensive and regional characteristics of geography can play its unique role in serving agricultural production. Agricultural climate, agricultural hydrology, agricultural geomorphology, biogeography, soil geography, agricultural geography, and agricultural maps in geography are all disciplines directly related to agricultural production. As long as these services strengthen specialization, give play to comprehensive characteristics, and work with other related disciplines to concentrate forces, cooperate closely, and fight together, we will surely continue to achieve outstanding results on the agricultural production front.

Under the current excellent situation, let us hold high the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, with full of confidence, full of energy, conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought into geographical work, and make more contributions to the vigorous development of agriculture and grain production.

    地理学要为农业生产服务
    中国科学院地理研究所副所长　李秉枢
    建国以来，在党的领导下，全国地理工作者坚决地贯彻了科学为社会主义建设服务的方针，密切联系生产实践，依靠群众，在改造自然、综合利用自然资源、地区经济开发和生产布局等方面，做了许多工作，积累了大量的科学资料，提出了有益的科学论证，为社会主义建设做出了贡献。地理学在为社会主义建设服务的过程中，在室内建立各种实验室，在野外建立定位、半定位观测站，进一步运用了定性同定量相结合的科学分析方法，运用了物理化学等现代科学技术知识，开始摆脱了单纯描述的落后状态，使这门科学出现了新的气象。这是党的发展科学方针的胜利。
    党中央和毛主席提出了发展国民经济以农业为基础、以工业为主导、优先发展重工业同迅速发展农业相结合的方针，以及全党动员全民动手大办农业、大办粮食的指示，在我国社会主义建设中发挥了并将继续发挥伟大的指导作用。以农业为基础的方针向地理科学提出了艰巨、迫切而又光荣的任务，使地理工作者更加明确了努力方向，同时也赋予地理科学新的生命力，为地理科学开辟了广阔的研究领域。
    地理学为农业生产服务大有可为
    地理学是在劳动人民向自然作斗争和进一步认识、利用、改造自然的实践过程中发展起来的，因此，地理学从来就同农业生产有着紧密的联系，地理工作者在对待上述问题上能够比较好地注意因地制宜的原则。地理工作者在为农业生产服务方面是大有可为的。我们知道，农业生产最主要的对象是农作物，而影响农作物生长发育的自然因素是复杂的、多方面的，其中有些因素是目前人力所不能控制或不能完全控制的。为了发展农业，必须充分利用有利条件，改造不利条件。例如，华北地区常年降雨量在400—600毫米，从全年来看是可以满足农作物生长的需要的，但是由于雨量的季节分布不均匀，形成春旱、秋涝的现象。如果修建水利工程，把夏秋多余的雨水储存起来，因时制宜地使用，就可以大大地提高农作物产量。北京地区的积温是可以满足谷类作物一年两熟的，但是由于早晚霜冻的短暂侵袭，一年两熟没有保证。如果用人工方法加以控制（例如灌水、熏烟、温床育苗等），防止和减轻一度出现的早晚霜冻的危害，就可以作到一年两熟。我国幅员广大，自然条件复杂，有赤道带、热带、亚热带、暖温带、温带、寒温带，有湿润区、半湿润区、干旱区、半干旱区，有辽阔的平原、最高的山岭、最大的高原，以及分布很广的丘陵、盆地和沙漠。为发展农业而采取任何利用、控制、改造自然的措施，都必须针对不同地区的特点，因地制宜，找到更好、更省的办法。这就往往要比较全面地了解各项有关自然条件，分析这些条件的相互关系。而要进行这些工作，地理工作者就正好可以大显身手。因为，自然地理学的最主要内容是研究水分、热量、土地和生物资源的分布和变化，由个别因素的研究到不同因素之间相互关系的综合研究，由认识它们到利用、控制、改造它们。经济地理的主要任务是对自然资源和利用、改造自然的措施进行技术经济评价，研究生产合理布局问题。所有这些方面的工作，都同农业生产有密切的关系，不但可能而且应该有助于农业的发展。
    已经获得的丰收和还要做的工作
    水利是农业的命脉。我国是季风活动地区，雨量变化多端，旱涝威胁很大。在干旱和半干旱地区，要着重扩大水源，节约用水；在湿润和半湿润地区，除着重控制洪水和战胜涝灾外，要注意调节季节的和多年的水量的不平衡。几年来，地理工作者同其他科学工作者一起，在这一方面已经作出了许多贡献。例如，我们在黄河中游地区全面调查和分析了水土流失的自然因素，在总结群众经验的基础上提出和贯彻了自上而下、坡沟兼顾、生物措施同工程措施相结合的综合治理方针，有效地防止了水土流失，大大地提高了农业产量。我们帮助了群众在祁连山、天山进行融冰化雪，解决了部分农田的灌溉用水。我们还开展了防止水分蒸发，了解各种水源的来龙去脉，提出解决用水供需之间的不平衡方案，最大限度地合理和节约使用现有水源等工作。此外，关于防止风沙对农作物的危害，关于寻找地下水，关于水库库址选择，关于小地区的洪水预报和预防，关于洼地改造，关于河网和排灌系统布置，关于改进灌溉制度等等，也都需要因地制宜地应用地理学知识和地理学方法，并都有了地理工作者的参加。当然，根据客观现实的需要，地理工作者在这些方面还是做得很不够的，今后还要更大地发挥自己的作用。特别是对季风活动规律、水分平衡、水利资源的综合利用、实现水利化后自然条件可能变化的预测等的研究，更需要大大地加强。这对农业生产不仅将有重大的现实作用，而且也将有长远的意义。
    战胜气候和水文对农田的不利影响，控制和调节农作物生长的自然条件，对于农业增产具有十分重要的意义。例如，早晚霜冻虽然出现的时间很短，但对作物危害很大，严重时可以使作物大大减产。在生产实践中，防霜冻已经积累了丰富的经验，当前的问题是要进一步掌握霜冻发生的规律，提出更经济、更有效的预防方法。研究适合于不同作物速生丰产的农田小气候和农业水文条件，找出控制和利用这些条件的有效办法，可以促使农作物低产的变高产，高产的更高产。如小麦丰产问题，通过研究小麦生长发育的小气候和农业水文条件，可以提出最适宜的播种时间和相适应的田间管理措施。根据各地区自然经济条件、特别是水热条件的综合研究，可以提出关于一年一熟地区变为一年两熟或两年三熟地区的合理分布农作物和耕作制度的有关科学依据。此外，大量寻找适宜的地形和小气候条件，用人工控制小气候的方法，扩大热带作物种植地区，以满足国民经济发展的需要的工作，也有必要继续大力进行。
    在发挥现有耕地肥力的同时，积极扩大耕地面积是发展农业的一项重要措施。我国现有耕地约占全国总土地面积的八分之一左右，还有广大的土地资源需要更有效地开发利用，其中可垦荒地面积很大。为了迅速开发利用这些荒地，必须查明荒地的分布、质量、有利和不利条件，提出改造利用的方式和措施。为了更多快好省地完成这项任务，必须大规模发动群众广泛进行荒地普查，同时还可推广航空照片的综合利用，编制各种土地资源的分布图和评价图。
    为了有效地促进人民公社生产的综合发展和经济的全面跃进，三年来地理工作者在十九个省、市、自治区深入一百多个公社，在公社党委领导下，根据国民经济需要、公社的自然条件特点和原有经济基础，制定了全面性的生产发展规划，明确了公社生产发展方向，各阶段生产发展的重点和规模，生产的合理布局，以及劳力、投资和有关保证措施的安排等。地理工作者应该在已有工作的基础上，进一步深入开展这方面的工作，特别是着重地解决当前生产上存在的关键性问题，如大面积丰产基地和商品生产基地的建立，土地的合理利用，耕作区、畜牧场、排灌系统、道路和居民点的合理布局，劳动力的合理组织和调配，以及促进农业机械化迅速实现的有关条件的综合研究等。
    此外，大地区的综合考察，农业规划和区划，农业气候资源的合理利用，以及有关农业生产的专题研究，也都是必须继续进行的重要工作。
    要为大办农业、大办粮食
          作更大的努力
    地理工作者通过十一年来的工作实践，在为生产服务，特别是在为农业服务和本门学科发展方面，在工作上和思想上都获得了丰收。我们不仅明确了方向，而且也摸索到了这门科学的发展道路。在实际工作中，我们有如下一些体会。
    一、地理科学工作在党的领导下，坚决贯彻党的科学研究为社会主义建设服务的方针和以任务带学科的方法，是保证胜利完成国家任务和迅速发展本门学科的基本关键。贯彻科学为生产服务的方针和任务带学科的方法的过程，实质上就是科学工作中两条道路长期反复斗争的过程。地理工作的实践，也充分地证明了这一点。因此，巩固地树立科学为社会主义建设服务的思想，进一步清除资产阶级思想的残余和为科学而科学、脱离生产实践的倾向，就成为地理工作者当前的首要任务。
    二、社会主义生产实践既要求地理学能够对生产发展指出远景方向和提供科学依据，也要求解决当前大办农业、大办粮食中的有关具体问题。这就要求地理工作者坚决地勇敢地投到农业生产的最前线，解决农业生产上与地理有关的具体问题。如吉林省辑安县地理学会发动会员研究辑安的小气候，根据积温情况，初步解决了这个县的稻麦连种的问题，受到了县委的重视。地理工作者必须彻底革新工作方法，以新知识、新技术武装自己，既要敢于打破地理学的旧“框框”，主动地同有关科学共同努力，解决生产实践问题，也要坚决地克服在革新过程中遇到困难时的恋旧思想。能否坚决革新，积极学习新技术，也就是科学发展中要不要革命和敢不敢革命的问题。因此，今后在工作中要更好地贯彻毛主席的在战略上藐视困难、在战术上重视困难的思想，树立边干边学、苦学苦干的作风，树立百折不挠的信心和决心，踏踏实实地为农业生产解决实际问题，丰富本门学科，并创造性地发展新学科。
    三、地理学要有效地为生产实践服务和迅速地得到发展，必须建立在广泛的群众基础之上。科学同生产的关系就是理论同实践的关系。科学和理论都来自生产实践。科学为生产服务主要在于把研究成果推广到生产中去，指导生产实践；科学是手段，建设社会主义，建设现代化工业、现代化农业，发展生产才是目的。手段要为目的服务，因此必须使科学工作紧密结合生产。地理工作者能不能走群众路线、依靠群众，是能不能为生产实践服务的前提。农民在认识自然、改造和利用自然、发展生产的长期过程中，积累了极为丰富的经验，我们要虚心地拜群众为师，善于向群众学习。我们要深入公社，长期挂钩，同他们一起解决同地理学有关的农业生产问题，通过实践把他们的宝贵经验好好地总结归纳成为理论，再以此指导生产实践，进一步为农业生产服务。如吉林地理工作者学习了辽源人民公社戴喜禄同志在大架山治山治水的经验，帮助总结提出“以蓄为主、治坡为主、全面规划、综合治理”的方法，就使大架山农业大大发展，成为“秃山变成绿山头，浑水不见清水流，粮食瓜果大丰收”的好地方。只有像这样的理论，才能容易地为群众掌握，更好地指导生产实践，使地理学在群众中生根落实，从而巩固地奠定本门学科发展的基础。
    四、生产实践中所提出的具体问题，往往不是任何一门学科所能圆满解决的。同样，农业生产中的问题，也都是综合性的，而且又同一定地区的自然条件密切关联着。地理学所具有的综合性和区域性的特点，在为农业生产服务中正可发挥它的独特作用。地理学中的农业气候、农业水文、农业地貌、生物地理、土壤地理、农业地理、农业地图等，都是同农业生产直接有关的学科。只要使这些兵种在加强专业化的基础上，发挥综合性的特点，并会同其他有关学科，集中力量，密切配合，协同作战，就一定能在农业生产战线上，不断取得出色的战果。
    在当前的大好形势下，让我们高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，满怀信心，鼓足干劲，认真地学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的著作，把毛泽东思想坚决地贯彻到地理工作中去，为大办农业、大办粮食作出更多的贡献。
