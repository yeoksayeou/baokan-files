Xinhua News Agency, London, November 23rd: British Prime Minister Macmillan concluded his two-day official visit to Italy yesterday, during which he held talks with Italian Prime Minister Fanfani and others.

Following the visit to Rome by the British Lord Privy Seal Heath at the end of August, Macmillan's visit is another step in Britain's efforts to expand its influence over Italy. Italy is considered a weak link in the six-nation "Common Market" group. Italy is dissatisfied with its secondary status in the Six-Nation Group and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Economically, although Italy is a member of the Common Market, it conducts a large amount of trade with Britain. It is revealed that Macmillan specifically expressed to Fanfani during the talks his hope that Italy would play an "important role" in the "reconciliation" of the "Six" and "Seven" nations.

The communiqué issued after the talks used ambiguous wording regarding the outcome of the talks. It stated that "both sides are studying the problems arising from the existence of the two groups ("Six" and "Seven") and are determined to seek solutions." The London "Daily Telegraph" also pointed out today that despite expressions of harmony between each other, Macmillan's visit undoubtedly "did not achieve" the expected "practical results."

Another issue discussed by both sides was the increasingly developing situation of the African national liberation movement and the coordination of Western policies towards underdeveloped countries. Newspapers revealed that during the talks, the two sides also discussed the joint "development" of newly independent Somalia by the United States, Britain, and Italy.

According to reports, the two sides also exchanged views on the United States' "fourth nuclear force" plan in view of the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Group's Council of Ministers.

It was announced that experts from the two countries will hold a further series of talks in Rome or London on Anglo-Italian trade issues.

### 各怀鬼胎　同床异梦  英意会谈未获具体结果

    各怀鬼胎　同床异梦
    英意会谈未获具体结果
    新华社伦敦23日电　英国首相麦克米伦昨天结束了他对意大利的为时两天的正式访问，在访问期间，他同意大利总理范范尼等举行了会谈。
    在英国掌玺大臣希思在8月底访问罗马以后，麦克米伦的这次访问是英国竭力扩大它对意大利的影响的另一步骤。意大利被认为是六国“共同市场”集团中的薄弱环节。意大利对于自己在六国集团和北大西洋公约组织中的次要地位是不满意的。在经济上，尽管意大利是共同市场的一个成员国，它却同英国进行大量的贸易。据透露，麦克米伦在这次会谈中特别向范范尼表示，希望意大利在“六国”和“七国”的“和解”上起“重要的作用”。
    会谈结束后发表的公报对会谈的结果的措词是含糊的。它说，“双方正在研究由于两个集团（“六国”和“七国”）存在而产生的问题，并且有决心去寻求解决的办法”。伦敦“每日电讯报”今天也指出，尽管相互之间表示融洽，但是麦克米伦的访问无疑“没有达到”预期的“实际结果”。
    双方讨论的另一个问题是非洲民族解放运动日益发展的局势和协调西方对不发达国家的政策问题。报纸透露，在会谈期间，双方还讨论了美国、英国和意大利共同“开发”新独立的索马里的问题。
    据报道，由于北大西洋集团部长理事会即将举行，双方还就美国的“第四核力量”的计划交换了意见。
    据宣布，两国专家将就英意贸易问题在罗马或者伦敦进一步举行一系列的会谈。
