    Listen to the Party, Rely on the Masses
    -- An Account of Du Xinxu, Party Branch Secretary of the Caojia Production Team, Wuzhangyuan Commune, Zhouzhi County
    An Lu, Zhang Guang, Lü Hua
    Every grassroots cadre has his own characteristics. Du Xinxu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Caojia Production Team in the Wuzhangyuan Commune, Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi, is characterized by having "numbers" in his mind in whatever he does, resolutely listening to the Party, and always standing on the side of the majority of working people.

    Seeking Truth from Facts
    In the spring of 1958, the face of Wuzhangyuan changed dramatically. This dry plain, which had never seen running water and protruded forty-five zhang above the ground, was now a scene of clear waves. Water, like sweet dew, soaked the wheat fields of Wuzhangyuan, and the wheat seedlings grew upwards by a joint every day. That year, everything on Wuzhangyuan awakened exceptionally early. The earth was lush green, the willows were shaded, and the flowers were bright. Mount Taibai, standing behind it, seemed particularly majestic, and the Wei River, flowing eastward in front of it, also played the song of the Great Leap Forward. It was at this time that a mass movement of vowing to achieve high wheat yields was launched throughout Guanzhong.
    Du Xinxu, as the deputy head of Wuzhangyuan Township and director of the Yuanxin Agricultural Cooperative, confidently attended the county's vow-making conference. When discussing the targets, Du Xinxu was the first to speak. He said: "Wuzhangyuan is a dry plain. In the past, wheat only yielded a little over a hundred catties per mu. Now that the water is here, our cooperative must achieve an average yield of four hundred and fifty catties per mu over a large area, and the high-yield fields must reach one thousand five hundred catties per mu." Before he could finish speaking, several young people opened their already-written big-character posters, with per-mu targets far exceeding Du Xinxu's.
    Du Xinxu felt a little uneasy. However, when he recalled the wheat fields of his cooperative, he calmed down again. He and the masses had planted all seventeen hundred mu of wheat in the cooperative together. He knew every measure, including deep plowing, base fertilizer, and seed varieties. When he came, he and the cooperative members studied the yields plot by plot according to the measures. Some people even felt that the current target was too high. Who knew that at this meeting, someone would say that his proposed target was "conservative!" Du Xinxu thought: I am speaking according to the actual situation. It is not enough to have high targets; we must also look at the measures and, even more, at the reality. The Party has taught us to seek truth from facts. Du Xinxu's attitude attracted the attention of the county Party secretary, who said: "Du Xinxu has soaring enthusiasm and can also analyze problems realistically. This attitude is worthy of our learning."
    That year, the average yield of the entire cooperative reached four hundred and five catties per mu, and the high-yield fields reached one thousand and seventy-two catties. In either case, the yield was the highest in the surrounding area. The cooperative members composed a song and sang: "It's pleasing to look at, anxious to harvest, laborious to transport, and laughably abundant to thresh. It's the first time in history, and we're worried about where to pile it."
    Seeing that some cooperative members were excessively proud of their achievements, Du Xinxu said: "Although we harvested a lot of wheat this year, we didn't reach our target. We need to study where the measures were insufficient. We can't just stay the same next year; we need to aim for eight hundred catties." The cooperative members said with great admiration: "Hey, you're already thinking about next year's business!"

    Adhering to Policies
    After communization, Du Xinxu was elected as the Party Branch Secretary of the Wuzhangyuan Production Team of the Wuzhangyuan Commune. There was a production team here—Xigou Village—that was relatively backward, so Du Xinxu moved to live in this team. As soon as he arrived, he took stock. This team had one hundred and ninety-two households, one hundred and three of which were middle peasants, eighty-one of whom were upper-middle peasants. After understanding these numbers, he paid attention to finding problems from these numbers.
    At that time, the Party called for winter irrigation of wheat. The middle peasants said: "People for generations have never heard of winter irrigation of wheat. It's just asking for trouble!" The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "There are many things we haven't seen before. Let's try winter irrigation and see the world." When he asked the team cadres, they also did not advocate winter irrigation, saying: "The majority of the masses do not agree." From many things, Du Xinxu found that the team cadres, because they superstitiously believed in the middle peasants in terms of production technology, unconsciously relied on them politically. Du Xinxu said to the team cadres: "Although the poor and lower-middle peasants are a minority here, they are the basic masses, who listen to the Party the most and resolutely follow the Party." In order to solve this problem, he supported the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants, persuaded the majority of the middle peasants, and decided to carry out winter irrigation; at the same time, a small plot of land was left unirrigated for comparative experiments. After checking some time later, the winter-irrigated seedlings had grown seven or eight strong roots, while the unirrigated seedlings had only grown three or four fine, hairy roots. Those middle peasants who did not advocate winter irrigation had nothing to say, and the team cadres also understood. The masses reflected: "Alas! In the past, we suffered from not listening to the Party." From then on, the poor and lower-middle peasants stood in the leading position not only politically but also in production technology. Because the cadres of this team listened to the Party and relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants in production, they gradually changed their backward state.
    This spring, Du Xinxu was transferred to the Caojia Production Team. The cadres of the Zhengjialing Team, which belonged to this production team, reflected: "The masses in our team are now difficult to lead." As soon as Du Xinxu heard this, he felt something was wrong. He said: "There are no masses who are difficult to lead, only cadres who don't know how to do leadership work." So he moved to Zhengjialing to live. At that time, the anti-drought movement was in full swing. As soon as he arrived, he went to the fields and pushed water carts with the masses, and also carried dry rations to the mountains to find water sources, working continuously for more than twenty days. In production labor, he became one with the masses, and the masses told him everything. Du Xinxu learned from the masses that this team had always been advanced in the past, taking the lead in forming mutual aid groups, elementary cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives. Precisely because of this, the cadres became complacent, did not see the new situation brought about by the Great Leap Forward after communization, and instead of making their work more meticulous and solid, they became afloat and did not conscientiously implement the Party's policies. After learning about this situation, Du Xinxu said to the team cadres: "The Party's policies cannot be discounted. Every policy stipulated by the Party has its reasons." So he handled many problems in the team according to the policies: everything used by the team members was thoroughly investigated, and those that the team members did not use were returned with money at a price; those that were borrowed were all recorded; under the circumstances that did not delay collective labor, the team members were allowed to cultivate their private plots well and increase their income; everything that had not been clearly recorded for the team members was calculated clearly by him. He also convened a meeting of all the team cadres, letting the well-led production teams introduce their work experiences, especially the experience of resolutely implementing the Party's policies. Then he returned to Zhengjialing, propagated the Party's policies with the cadres, and checked the shortcomings and errors in the past work. The masses were all very happy.

    Representing the True Interests of the Masses
    Sometimes, although things are done for the masses in accordance with the Party's policies, the masses do not understand them for a while, or even have doubts. At this time, Du Xinxu can adhere to principles, patiently educate, wait for, and improve the masses, and finally get things done, which is warmly welcomed by the masses.
    In the winter of 1957, the Party issued a call to develop water conservancy on a large scale. At that time, Du Xinxu, as the deputy head of Wuzhangyuan Township and director of the Yuanxin Agricultural Cooperative, was determined to bring water to Wuzhangyuan. However, the masses had no confidence, and everyone felt it was just empty talk. Some people said: "Zhuge Liang tried three times to bring water to the plain, but he did not succeed. What can we do?" Du Xinxu thought to himself: Although many people do not agree now, as long as the masses are truly mobilized, overcome difficulties, and make achievements, this truly represents the interests of the majority of the masses. On the one hand, Du Xinxu and Yang Fuyuan, the deputy director of the cooperative, carried dry rations and went into the mountains to survey; on the other hand, they continued to deeply mobilize the masses, and finally raised the masses' understanding and confidence. They said: "The Party can lead us to overthrow feudal society, and can also lead us to bring water to the plain."
    The big canal started construction. Two and a half li of this canal had to pass through stone cliffs, which were as steep as a high wall, and many people did not dare to go up. Du Xinxu and Yang Fuyuan tied themselves around the waist with ropes, climbed down the bluestone cliff, and drilled holes for blasting. The first blast was successful, and the young people also started doing the same. In less than a month, a green channel appeared on the stone cliff.
    During the Spring Festival of 1958, the new canal was opened. That morning, this long dragon that climbed up Wuzhangyuan inserted its mouth into the river of Wolf Son Gully, sucking up water in large gulps. The clear stream flowed over like a dancing silk, winding and wandering. For the first time, people heard the gurgling sound of running water on this thousand-year-old dry plain. At this time, what could be more exciting than the people of Wuzhangyuan! They ran, they laughed, and even the solemn Qinling Mountains seemed to be dancing.
    From then on, the history of "water being more expensive than oil" in Wuzhangyuan ended.
    At this time, Du Xinxu and Yang Fuyuan, carrying iron shovels and beaming with smiles, walked from the upper reaches of the canal. They had braved the cold wind last night to check the canal one last time. Du Xinxu walked into the crowd and said: "Now everyone can rest assured!" The masses said: "As long as there is the Communist Party, there is nothing that cannot be done. We have long been relieved!"

    Growing Up in Struggle
    Du Xinxu is forty-three years old this year. On his face are deeply engraved wrinkles that bear witness to the suffering and torment he endured in the old society. He was a poor peasant who worked as a day laborer. As soon as Wuzhangyuan was liberated, he welcomed his army as passionately as fire. Because he actively worked for everyone, Du Xinxu, who had been oppressed in the old society, quickly became the village head of the new society, leading the people in a resolute struggle against feudal forces.
    In January 1956, the Yuanxin Agricultural Cooperative was transformed into an advanced cooperative, and Du Xinxu was elected as the accountant. At this time, the seven landlord households and two rich peasant households in the cooperative, taking advantage of the spontaneous ideas of the well-to-do middle peasants, colluded with some middle peasants and backward masses, and were determined to bring Du Xinxu down. When handing over public grain, the landlords and rich peasants incited the masses to hand over wheat that had sprouted. Du Xinxu did not agree. The well-to-do middle peasants retorted: "What the masses say is what we do? The minority must obey the majority." Later, they also created rumors among the masses: "Du Xinxu has embezzled four hundred shi of wheat..." Attempting to incite some backward masses to settle accounts.
    Du Xinxu thought that the masses did not know the truth, and as a Communist Party member, he was primarily responsible for relaxing political work. But he believed that as long as he adhered to the truth and did his job well, the masses would understand, and the temporary "majority" would become a minority. He talked to the poor and lower-middle peasants from house to house. After the masses saw the facts clearly and understood that they had been deceived, they unanimously rose up to fight against the landlords and rich peasants. Under the leadership of Du Xinxu, all the cooperative members finally suppressed these demons and monsters. The heinous landlords were sentenced to imprisonment by the people's government according to law, and everyone elected Du Xinxu as the director of the cooperative.
    From this struggle, Du Xinxu drew the experience: "Have a firm class stand, and never be separated from the masses, especially not from the poor and lower-middle peasants." From then on, he paid attention to uniting the masses around the Party at all times, and relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and relied on the vast majority of the working people in whatever he did.

    听党的话　依靠群众
    ——记盩厔县五丈原公社曹家生产队党支部书记杜新绪
    安禄　张光　吕化
    每个基层干部都有自己的特色。陕西盩厔县五丈原公社曹家生产队党支部书记杜新绪的特色是：无论做啥事都是胸中有“数”，坚决听党的话，永远站在大多数劳动群众的一面。
    实事求是
    1958年春天，五丈原的面貌大大改变了。这个从来没有看见过流水、突出地面四十五丈高的旱原，如今一片清波。水像甘露一样浸润着五丈原的麦田，麦苗呼呼的一天朝上长一节子。这一年，五丈原的万物苏醒得可特别早。大地一片葱绿，柳暗花明，立在它身后的太白山，显得特别雄伟，从它身前滔滔东流的渭水，也奏起了大跃进的歌声。就在这时，关中各地到处开展了小麦丰产誓师群众运动。
    作为五丈原副乡长兼原心农业社社主任的杜新绪，满怀信心地去参加了县上召开的誓师大会。讨论指标的时候，杜新绪第一个发言，他说：“五丈原是个旱原，过去麦子一亩地只打一百多斤。现在水上去了，我们社大面积亩产要达到四百五十斤，高产田亩产要达到一千五百斤。”他的话还没有说完，有几个青年就打开自己早已写好了的大字报，亩产指标远远超过了杜新绪。
    杜新绪有些不安了。可是，他一回想自己社的麦田，又镇静了下来。全社的一千七百亩麦田，是他和群众一起种下去的，深翻、底肥、籽种，各项措施他都一清二楚。来的时候，他和社员们一块一块地按措施研究了产量，有一些人还觉得现在这个指标太高，谁知道在这会上竟有人说他提的指标“保守！”杜新绪想：我是按实际说的。光指标高不行，还要看措施，更要看实际，党教育我们实事求是。杜新绪的态度引起了县委书记的注意，他说：“杜新绪有冲天的干劲，也能实事求是的分析问题，这种态度，值得我们学习。”
    这一年全社亩产平均达到了四百零五斤，高额丰产田达到了一千零七十二斤。不管哪一样，产量在周围都是最高的。社员编了歌儿唱道：“看着喜，割着急，运着费劲，打着笑煞人。开天辟地第一回，保管发愁没处堆。”
    杜新绪看着有些社员过份得意自己的成绩，就说：“虽然今年麦子打得不少，可是没达到咱们的指标。要研究一下，是啥地方措施不到，明年可不能还是这些，要向八百斤上进。”社员们非常敬佩地说：“嘿，你倒又想上明年的事了！”
    坚持按政策办事
    公社化以后，杜新绪被选为五丈原公社五丈原生产队党支部书记。这里有一个生产小队——西沟村，比较落后一些，杜新绪就搬到这个队去住。他一去摸底，这个小队有一百九十二户，一百零三户是中农，其中八十一户还是上中农。他了解了这个数字，就注意从这个数字中找问题。
    当时党号召给小麦冬灌。中农们说：“人老几辈就没听说过小麦冬灌，寻着招祸哩！”贫雇农说：“过去没见过的事多着哩，咱们冬灌一回见见世面。”他一问小队干部，他们也不主张冬灌，还说：“多数群众不赞成。”杜新绪从许多事情中发现，这个小队的干部由于在生产技术上迷信中农，进而不自觉的在政治上也依靠他们了。杜新绪向小队干部说：“贫雇农在你们这虽是少数，他们可是基本群众，最听党的话，坚决跟着党走的。”为了解决这个问题，他支持贫雇农的意见，说服了大部分中农，就决定开展冬灌；同时，留出一小块地不冬灌，进行对比试验。过些时候一检查，冬灌了的一个苗生了七、八个壮根，没冬灌的只生了三、四个细毛毛根，那些不主张冬灌的中农没话说了，小队干部也明白过来了。群众反映说：“咳！过去就是吃了没听党的话的亏。”从此，贫雇农不光在政治上而且在生产技术上也站在领导地位。由于这个队的干部在生产上听党的话，依靠贫雇农，逐渐改变了落后状态。
    今年春天杜新绪调到曹家生产队，这个生产队所属的郑家堎小队的干部反映：“我们队的群众现在难领导了。”杜新绪一听就不对劲，他说：“没有难领导的群众，只有不会做领导工作的干部。”他就搬到郑家堎去住。那时正热火朝天闹抗旱运动，他一去就到地里和群众一起推水车，又背上干粮上山找水源，一直干了二十多天。他在生产劳动中，和群众打成一片，群众无话不对他说。杜新绪从群众中了解到，这个小队过去一直是先进的，不论是成立互助组、初级社、高级社都是走在前头。正因为这样，干部有了自满情绪，公社化以后看不见大跃进带来的新形势，不是工作越来越细致扎实，而是飘浮起来了，对党的政策不认真贯彻。杜新绪了解了这些情况后，就向小队干部说：“党的政策不能打折扣，党无论规定一条什么政策，都有它的道理。”他就按政策处理了队里的许多问题：凡是用社员的东西都清查清楚，社员不用的，作价还钱；借用的，都记了账；在不耽误集体劳动的情形下，让社员种好自留地，增加收入；凡是没有给社员把工记清楚的，他都给算清楚了。他又召集全队干部开会，让领导好的生产小队介绍他们的工作体会和经验，特别是坚决执行党的政策的经验。然后再回到郑家堎去，和干部一起宣传党的政策，检查过去工作中的缺点和错误，群众皆大欢喜。
    代表群众的真正利益
    有时候虽然按照党的政策为群众办事，而群众一时不了解，甚至有怀疑。杜新绪在这时能坚持原则，耐心地教育、等待和提高群众，最后把事情办成，受到群众的热烈欢迎。
    1957年冬，党发出大兴水利的号召。那时，作为五丈原乡副乡长兼原心农业社社主任的杜新绪，有决心把水引上五丈原。可是，群众没有信心，谁都觉得不过是一句空话。有些人说：“诸葛亮三次引水上原，都没有成功，我们还有啥办法。”杜新绪心里想：尽管许多人现在不赞成，只要把群众真的发动起来，战胜困难，做出成绩，这才真正代表大多数群众的利益。杜新绪一方面和社副主任杨福元等，背上干粮进山勘察；一方面继续深入发动群众，终于提高了群众的认识和信心，他们说：“党能领导我们打倒封建社会，也能领导我们把水引上原来。”
    大渠动工了。这条渠，有二里半要从石崖上穿过，崖陡得像一堵高墙，许多人都不敢上。杜新绪和杨福元用绳子把自己腰绑住，爬下青石崖，打眼放炮。第一炮成功了，青年人也都照样干起来。没有一个月，石崖上出现了一条青色的渠道。
    1958年春节，新水渠放水了。那天早上，爬上五丈原的这条长龙，把口插在狼儿子沟的河里，大口大口地把水吸了上来，清流像舞动的绸子一样，弯弯曲曲的飘游过来了。人们第一次在这千年的旱原上，听到了潺潺的流水声。这时，还能有什么比得上五丈原的人们兴奋呢！他们跑呀，笑呀，连庄严的秦岭也好像舞蹈了起来。
    从此，五丈原“水比油贵”的历史结束了。
    就在这时，杜新绪和杨福元，扛着铁铣眉开眼笑地从水渠上游走来了。他俩昨天夜里冒着寒风，最后再一次检查了水渠。杜新绪走到人群中说：“这下大家把心放下了吧！”群众说：“只要有共产党，没有办不成的事。我们早就把心放下了！”
    在斗争中成长
    杜新绪今年四十三岁了，在他的脸上，深深地刻印着在旧社会受了许多痛苦和折磨的皱纹。他是一个打短工出身的贫农。五丈原一解放，他像火一样热烈的迎接自己的军队。由于他积极为大家办事，旧社会受压迫的杜新绪很快就当了新社会的村长，领导人民和封建势力作坚决的斗争。
    1956年1月，原心农业社转成了高级社，杜新绪被选为会计。这时社里的七户地主和两户富农，利用富裕中农的自发思想，串通了一部分中农和落后群众，一心要把杜新绪搞垮。交公粮的时候，地主富农煽动群众把出了芽的麦交上去。杜新绪不赞成。富裕中农顶过来说：“群众说咋办就咋办？少数要服从多数。”以后，他们又在群众中制造谣言：“杜新绪贪污小麦四百石，……”企图鼓动一部分落后群众起来算账。
    杜新绪想，群众不明真相，作为共产党员，自己放松政治工作，首先有责任。但是他相信，只要坚持真理，作好工作，群众是会明白过来的，暂时的“多数”会变成少数的。他逐户找贫雇农谈话，群众看清了事实，明白自己受骗之后，就一致起来和地主富农作斗争。全体社员在杜新绪的领导下，终于把这些牛鬼蛇神压下去了，罪大恶极的地主被人民政府依法判处了徒刑，大家选杜新绪当了社主任。
    从这场斗争中，杜新绪得出经验说：“有坚定的阶级立场，一刻也不脱离群众，特别是不脱离贫雇农。”从此以后，他处处注意把群众团结在党的周围，无论办什么事情，都依靠贫雇农，依靠绝大多数劳动群众。
