Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 20th: Yunnan Province's mechanical industry departments have already rushed to manufacture the approximately one thousand sets of irrigation and drainage machinery originally planned for production in the first quarter of next year. Currently, many factories have already cast a batch of water pump housings and parts according to the new plan, some of which are being processed and assembled.

In order to ensure that these approximately one thousand sets of irrigation and drainage machinery are all manufactured before the end of this year, the province's mechanical industry departments have rationally divided the work according to the existing equipment and technical conditions of each factory. Large-scale, electric water pumps are manufactured by machinery factories in Kunming; medium and small-sized, gas-powered water pumps are produced by machinery factories in special districts and counties. Provincial, municipal, and special district machinery factories produce main engines such as water pumps, electric motors, and gas engines, while county and commune machinery factories produce accessories such as water pipes and screws. This can not only shorten production time but also ensure complete product sets.

In order to make this batch of irrigation and drainage machinery of the highest quality, each machinery factory has conscientiously mobilized the masses to inspect this year's production, and conducted ideological education among the masses to emphasize product quality. The Kunming Water Pump Factory, which accounts for one-third of the province's water pump production, conducted quality inspections and mobilized the masses to renovate the iron-smelting furnace and add baking and annealing furnaces, which greatly reduced the scrap rate of castings. Workers in the metalworking workshop independently manufactured three special boring machines, ensuring that the boring of the water pump housings fully met the design requirements. The factory's workers also reviewed and revised the drawings and data to ensure that the drawings and data were completely consistent with the tools, molds, and fixtures. After taking the above measures, the processing quality and finished product quality of the water pumps have been significantly improved.

    提前为春耕做好准备
    云南力争年底以前生产一千套排灌机械
    据新华社昆明20日电　云南省机械工业部门已经提前赶制原定在明年第一季度生产的一千套左右的排灌机械。目前，许多工厂已经按照新的计划浇铸出一批水泵体壳和部件，其中有的正在进行加工和装配。
    为保证在今年年底把这一千套左右的排灌机械全部赶制出来，全省机械工业部门根据各厂现有的设备和技术条件进行了合理分工。大型的、电动的水泵由昆明的机械工厂制造；中小型、煤气带动的水泵由专区和县的机械厂生产。省、市、专区机械厂生产水泵、电动机、煤气机等主机，县、社机械厂生产水管、螺丝等配件。这样既可缩短生产时间，又能保证产品配套。
    为使这批排灌机械精益求精，各机械工厂认真发动群众检查了今年的生产情况，向群众进行了重视产品质量的思想教育。水泵产量占全省三分之一的昆明水泵厂，经过质量检查，发动群众改造化铁炉，增添了烤窑和退火炉，使铸件的废品率大大下降。金工车间职工自己动手制造出三台专用镗床，使水泵体壳的镗孔完全达到设计要求。这个厂的职工还对图纸资料进行了审查修改，作到图纸资料同工、模、夹具完全一致。采取上述措施以后，水泵的加工质量和成品质量都有显著提高。
