    For Further Development of Agriculture
    ——Tasks of Agriculture During Czechoslovakia's New Five-Year Plan
    During the new Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), Czechoslovakia's agricultural production will achieve further development.
    In order to further develop production, Czechoslovak agriculture currently has the following important tasks:
    1.  To support the young socialist large-scale production materially and technically; 2. To plan and prioritize the improvement of crop cultivation, which is the basis for developing other agricultural sectors; 3. To gradually and systematically implement agronomy inherent in large-scale production in various production sectors; 4. To strive to improve the business and organizational skills of farmers who have joined cooperatives in the shortest possible time.
    With the consolidation of the collectivization movement, investment in developing agriculture has increased in the national budget. Between 1952 and 1958, the total investment in the national economy expanded by 65%, while the agricultural sector expanded by 1.7 times. During the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), the total investment was 26.5 billion crowns, and it will reach about 40 billion crowns during the third Five-Year Plan.
    Since Czechoslovakia's land area is not large, it is necessary to maximize its utilization. The central issue currently being addressed is how to properly utilize groundwater. In Czechoslovakia, more than 2 million hectares of land have excessive groundwater for most of the year, resulting in a one-third reduction in harvest, while another 800,000 hectares of land could increase yields by 50% if artificial irrigation is used. By the end of the third Five-Year Plan, the fertility of more than one-third of the land will be improved through soil improvement or irrigation. More than half of the agricultural investment during the third Five-Year Plan will be used to improve land fertility.
    Before the war, there was only one and a half tractors per thousand hectares of land, but now there is one tractor per 65 hectares of land. In the past, less than 60% of the villages were electrified, but now all villages are 100% electrified.
    The third Five-Year Plan will be a decisive period for agricultural electrification. Currently, the annual consumption of electricity per hectare of land is 75-85 kWh, and it will increase to 180-200 kWh by 1965.
    In terms of the number of tractors, there will be one tractor for every 33 hectares of arable land in 1965. However, the central issue in striving for perfect mechanization is not just expanding the number of machines. To achieve complete mechanization of farmland work, it is necessary to provide various machines to the agricultural sector.
    In order to further develop agriculture, the Czechoslovak Party and government have dispatched a large number of cadres and technical experts to work in rural areas. In the first half of this year alone, 15,000 experts were sent to agricultural production cooperatives.
    According to the third Five-Year Plan, production will increase by 22% to 23% compared to the plan for 1960. By then, Czechoslovak agriculture will be able to provide a sufficient quantity of most major foods for the people of the whole country. Agricultural workers across the country are enthusiastically responding to the Party's call, preparing to strive for the early completion of the agricultural production tasks of the third Five-Year Plan. Several thousand agricultural cooperatives and hundreds of state farms have proposed striving to complete the agricultural production five-year plan one year ahead of schedule.

    为了进一步发展农业
    ——捷克斯洛伐克新五年计划期间农业的任务
    在新的五年计划期间（1961—1965年），捷克斯洛伐克的农业生产将获得进一步的发展。
    为了进一步发展生产，捷克斯洛伐克农业目前有如下的重要任务：
    一、从物质和技术上支持年轻的社会主义大生产；二、有计划地首先提高作物栽培业，这是发展农业其它部门的基础；三、逐步、按序地在各生产部门推行大生产所固有的农艺；四、争取在最短时期内提高已参加合作社的农民们的业务和组织才能。
    随着合作化运动的巩固，在国家预算方面对于发展农业的投资增加了。在1952—1958年间，对于国民经济的投资总数扩大了65％，而农业部门则扩大了一点七倍。在第二个五年计划期间（1956—1960年）投资总数为二百六十五亿克朗，在第三个五年计划期间则将达到四百亿克朗左右。
    由于捷克斯洛伐克土地面积不大，因而必须最大限度地利用它。目前所注意的中心问题在于如何正确地利用地下水。在捷克斯洛伐克有二百多万公顷土地整年内大部分时间地下水过多，因而收成减少三分之一，而另有八十万公顷左右的土地，如果利用人工灌溉，收成就能提高50％。到第三个五年计划末，通过改良土壤或灌溉的途径，三分之一以上的土地的肥力将提高。第三个五年计划期间农业方面的投资有一半以上将用于提高土地肥力。
    在战前，每一千公顷土地只有一台半拖拉机，而现在每六十五公顷土地就有一台拖拉机。过去电气化的乡村不到60％，而现在所有乡村都已100％的电气化。
    第三个五年计划将是农业电气化的一个具有决定意义的时期。目前每一公顷土地的电力的年度消耗量是75—85度，到1965年将增加到180—200度。
    在拖拉机数量方面，1965年将达到每三十三公顷耕地有一台拖拉机。然而，力求机械化工作完善的中心问题不只是在于扩大机器数量。为使农田工作实现通盘机械化，必须向农业部门提供各种机器。
    为了进一步发展农业，捷克斯洛伐克党和政府派遣了大批干部和技术专家到农村中去工作。今年上半年就有一万五千名专家被派到农业生产合作社去。
    根据第三个五年计划，同1960年的计划比较，生产将增长22％到23％。到那时，捷克斯洛伐克农业将能为全国人民提供足够数量的大部分主要食品。全国农业劳动者热烈响应党的号召，准备为争取提前完成第三个五年计划的农业生产任务而努力。有好几千个农业合作社和几百个国营农场提出要争取提前一年完成农业生产五年计划。
