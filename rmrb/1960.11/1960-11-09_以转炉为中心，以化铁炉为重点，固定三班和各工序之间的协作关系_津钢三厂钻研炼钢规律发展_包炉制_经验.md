Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th. Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant is continuously improving its enterprise management and implementing a "one-stop" regional management system, which has promoted a steady increase in steel production. After exceeding the full-month steel production task in September, it also exceeded the monthly production plan ahead of schedule in October. Steel production increased by 16.1% compared with September; the average daily steel output in the first six days of November increased by 11.2% compared with October. Converter furnace life, utilization coefficient, and steel ingot quality have also improved significantly, and the consumption of raw materials such as pig iron has been greatly reduced.

After the plant implemented the "Furnace-Based Responsibility" system in August, it solved problems such as uncoordinated shifts and inconsistent operations, which played a significant role in promoting production. However, the "Furnace-Based Responsibility" system could not completely solve the coordination and connection problems between the upper, lower, left, and right processes. In order to make the "Furnace-Based Responsibility" system more perfect and enable the production management organization to adapt to the characteristics of steelmaking production, the factory Party committee secretary held a foreman symposium to mobilize everyone to come up with ways to improve it based on their personal experience after implementing the "Furnace-Based Responsibility" system. The branch secretaries of each workshop also held worker symposiums to solicit opinions from the masses. The factory Party committee concentrated the wisdom of the masses, continued to develop and enrich the "Furnace-Based Responsibility" system, and creatively changed the original "Furnace-Based Responsibility" management system, which was mainly based on process principles, to a "one-stop" regional management system centered on steelmaking converters, highlighting cupolas, and connecting the upper, lower, left, and right processes. The main steelmaking processes from batching, charging, iron smelting, ladle, steelmaking to ingot casting, were formed into a "one-stop" system, and managed according to the "stop". This management method not only adapts to the characteristics of steelmaking production with multiple links and strong continuity, but also reflects the spirit of "centering on steelmaking converters and highlighting cupolas", forming a production management network and collaboration network that connects three shifts with one "stop" and closely links the upper, lower, left, and right processes. It fixed the cooperative relationship between the upper and lower three shifts and the upper, lower, left, and right processes in production organization management. The smelting workshop formed three "stops" according to this method, each including all aspects of steelmaking from the first process of batching to the last process of ingot casting. The workshop director is responsible for overall management work, and three deputy directors serve as the leaders of the three "stops" respectively; at the same time, Party and Youth League branches were also established according to "stop", and the workshop Party branch secretary is responsible for managing the overall work, and three deputy secretaries serve as the Party branch secretaries of the three "stops" respectively. In this way, the political and ideological work and organizational management work of the workers in each process and the upper and lower three shifts of each "stop" are unified.

After implementing the "stop"-based management system, the various processes have consistent thinking and actions, and the workers work together to produce more steel and better steel, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the workers. The factory issues five indicators of steel production, quality, consumption, safety, and furnace life by "stop", and then implements them to the workers in each process and shift. This strengthens the overall concept of each worker, making everyone in the "stop" realize that their every move is related to the completion of the entire production task, and the cooperation between the various processes is closer. After the plant implemented the "one-stop" regional management system, the most prominent effect was to shorten the steelmaking interruption time caused by poor coordination between the various processes. In mid-September, the first ten days of implementing the new management system, the good cooperation between the converter and the cupola, crane, ingot casting, and other processes, reduced the steelmaking interruption time by more than one-third compared with mid-August before the implementation of the new system, which relatively increased steel production by 26%. In the first twenty days of October, the production interruption time was reduced by 45.5% compared with the same period in September.

After implementing "stop"-based production organization and production management, the conditions between the various "stops" are the same and comparability is strong, which further promoted the extensive and in-depth development of the competition campaign. This competition includes both vertical competition between "stops" and horizontal competition between the same types of work in each "stop". For example, the ladle workers' no-leakage competition, the converter workers' hundred-furnace no-defective-products competition, and the bricklaying workers' no-fire-run competition. In total, there are more than 70 kinds of competition forms centered on high yield, high quality, and low consumption, making the plant's competition lively and thriving.

With the improvement and continuous perfection of production management work, leadership work has also become more in-depth, deeper, and more detailed. Party committee secretaries, factory directors, and other leading cadres go to the furnace every day to check the production of each "stop" on a daily basis. Because they directly participate in the leadership work of the "stops", workshop leaders are often with the workers, discovering and solving problems in a timely manner.

### 以转炉为中心，以化铁炉为重点，固定三班和各工序之间的协作关系  津钢三厂钻研炼钢规律发展“包炉制”经验

    以转炉为中心，以化铁炉为重点，固定三班和各工序之间的协作关系
    津钢三厂钻研炼钢规律发展“包炉制”经验
    全厂职工同心协力多产钢产好钢，炼钢中断时间大大缩短，钢产量稳步上升
    据新华社天津8日电　天津第三钢厂不断改进企业管理工作，实行“一条龙”区域性管理体制，促使钢产量稳步上升。在9月份超额完成全月产钢任务以后，10月份又提前超额完成了月度生产计划，钢产量比9月份提高16.1％；11月份头六天钢的平均日产量比10月份又提高了11.2％。转炉炉龄、利用系数、钢锭质量也都显著提高，生铁等材料的消耗大幅度降低。
    这个厂在8月份实行“包炉制”以后，解决了三班不衔接、操作不统一等问题，对促进生产起了很大作用。但是，“包炉制”还不能彻底解决上下左右各工序之间的协调衔接问题。为使“包炉制”更加完善，使生产管理组织工作能够适应炼钢生产的特点，工厂党委书记召开工长座谈会，发动大家根据实行“包炉制”以后的切身体会，共同想办法加以改进。各车间支部书记也召开工人座谈会，广泛征求群众的意见。工厂党委会集中了群众的智慧，继续发展丰富“包炉制”，创造性地把原来按工艺原则为主的“包炉制”管理体制改为以炼钢转炉为中心、以化铁炉为重点，联系上下左右各工序的“一条龙”区域性管理体制，把炼钢各主要工序从配料、进料、化铁、水包、炼钢到铸锭，组成“一条龙”，按“龙”管理。这种管理方法既适应了炼钢生产环节多、连续性强的特点，又体现了“以炼钢转炉为中心，以化铁炉为重点”的精神，构成了一个一“龙”串三班、上下左右各工序环环紧密相连的纵横交错的生产管理网和协作网，把上下三班和上下左右各工序之间的协作关系在生产组织管理上固定下来。冶炼车间按这个办法共组成了三条“龙”，每一条都包括从配料第一道工序直到最后一道工序铸锭的炼钢各个环节。车间主任负责全面管理工作，三个副主任分别担任三条“龙”的领导人；同时，还按“龙”成立了党和团的支部，车间党支部书记负责管理全面工作，三个副书记分别担任三条“龙”的党支部书记。这样，就把每一条“龙”的各工序、上下三班的工人的政治思想工作、组织管理工作统一起来了。
    实行按“龙”管理的体制以后，各工序之间思想一致，行动一致，工人们同心协力，为多产钢、产好钢共同奋斗，进一步调动了广大职工的积极性，工厂以“龙”为单位下达钢的产量、质量、消耗、安全和炉龄五个指标，然后再落实到各工序、各班的工人。这就加强了每个工人的整体观念，使“龙”内每个人都认识到自己的一举一动都同完成整个生产任务有关，各工序之间的协作更加密切。全厂推行“一条龙”区域性管理体制以后，最突出的效果是缩短了由于各工序之间衔接不好而产生的炼钢中断时间。9月中旬是实行新管理体制的第一旬，由于转炉和化铁炉、天车、铸锭等工序配合得好，使炼钢的中断时间比实行新体制前的8月中旬缩短了三分之一还多，使钢产量相对提高了26％。10月份前二十天，生产中断时间又比9月份同期缩短了45.5％。
    实行按“龙”组织生产和管理生产以后，由于各条“龙”之间条件相同，可比性很强，更进一步促进了竞赛运动的广泛深入开展。这种竞赛既有“龙”与“龙”之间纵的竞赛，又有各“龙”同工种之间横的竞赛。如水包工人的不漏包竞赛、转炉工人的百炉无废品竞赛、卧砖工人的不跑火竞赛等，总计各种以高产、优质、低耗为中心的竞赛形式有七十多种，使全厂的竞赛搞得热火朝天。
    随着生产管理工作的改进和不断完善，也使领导工作更加深入，越抓越深，越抓越细。党委书记、厂长等领导干部每天到炉前，逐日检查每条“龙”的生产情况。车间领导干部由于直接参加“龙”的领导工作，经常同工人在一起，及时发现和解决问题。
