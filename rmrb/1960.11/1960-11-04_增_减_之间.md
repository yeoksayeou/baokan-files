    Between "Increase" and "Decrease"
    Yu Yang
    In coal mining, there is a common practice: a coal mining face either doesn't "move," or if it does "move," production will decrease; a machine either isn't overhauled, or if it is overhauled, production will also decrease. The reasoning is: "Moving" and overhauling take up production time, and if time is taken up, output will decrease. However, the Du'erping Mine in Shanxi and the Yingcheng Coal Mine in Jilin have changed this practice.
    How exactly was the old "routine" broken? After reading the two news items published today, one prominent impression is: everything is about "striving." All victorious achievements are obtained through people's subjective efforts to grasp objective laws. No battle is won, no construction is successful, and no specific task is victorious without striving. Even a fruit within reach requires reaching out to grab it. Therefore, "striving" is the fundamental method of transforming all unfavorable factors into favorable factors, turning difficulties into smoothness, and changing decreased production into increased production. Before the increase production and practice economy movement, the Du'erping Mine always experienced decreased production whenever it "moved" the mining face. The fundamental problem was that it didn't proactively study the situation and find solutions. On the contrary, in planning work, it even regarded "decreased production" as an unchanging "routine," and whoever "moved" the mining face would have a lower target set for them when planning. In this way, only allowing non-striving naturally led to decreased production. When they realized this problem, they proactively conducted investigations and research, analyzed the reasons for past production decreases, strengthened preparations before "moving" the mining face, and determined measures such as "moving" ahead of schedule and overlapping production with "moving." The routine of "decreased production whenever 'moving'" was broken, and the new rule of "increased production after 'moving'" appeared.
    Some people say that "moving" the mining face can be overlapped with production, but when overhauling equipment, the machine always has to stop, so how can it be done without reducing output? People who believe in the power of the masses and are good at using their brains always have a way. For example, producing more coal before the overhaul, postponing tasks that can be postponed to the overhaul period, and simultaneously preparing for high output after the overhaul during the overhaul period are all good ways to ensure that the average output does not decrease. In addition, units requiring overhauls can carry out collaborative support, "you support me when I overhaul, and I support you when you overhaul," which can further allocate forces to fully increase production. Who says overhauls must lead to decreased production? Didn't the Yingcheng Coal Mine increase coal production by more than forty tons during equipment overhaul?
    Passively treating objective difficulties and calling these difficulties routines to legitimize them is one attitude; using the method of struggle to overcome various difficulties and create new routines is another attitude. In the complex production struggle, we must have a positive attitude and fight to the end for high output and high quality.

    “增”“减”之间
    于羊
    在采煤工作中，有一种惯例：采煤掌子面不“搬家”则已，“搬家”就要减产；机器不检修则已，检修也要减产。理由是：“搬家”和检修都要占去生产时间，时间被占去，产量就要减少了。山西杜儿坪矿和吉林营城煤矿却改变了这种惯例。
    老“常规”究竟怎样打破的？读过今天刊登的两条新闻，一个突出印象就是：事在必“争”。一切胜利成果都是由于人们的主观努力把握了客观规律而争取得来的。没有一项战斗的胜利，没有一项建设的胜利，没有一件具体的工作的胜利不是争取的结果。即使在手边的果实，也要伸手去拿一下才能到手。所以，“争”是把一切不利的因素变为有利因素，把困难变成顺利，把减产变为增产的根本方法。杜儿坪矿在增产节约运动以前，总是每“搬家”必减产，根本问题在于没有主动地去研究情况，寻找解决的办法，相反，在计划工作上还把“减产”看做了不变的“常规”，谁“搬家”在安排计划的时候就给他们订得低些。这样，只让不争，当然只好减产了。当他们意识到这个问题，主动地进行调查研究，分析了过去减产的原因，加强了“搬家”前的准备工作，确定了提前“搬家”，以及生产与“搬家”交叉进行等措施，“搬家”必减产的常规就打破了，“搬家”又增产的新规就出现了。
    有人说，掌子面“搬家”可以与生产交叉进行，检修设备，机器总得停下来，怎能做到不减少产量呢？相信群众力量而又善于动脑筋的人总是有办法的。比如说，赶在检修前多出一些煤，比如说，把可以推的工作推到检修期内做，比如说，在检修期内同时做好检修后争取高产的准备工作等等，都是保证平均产量不减少的好办法，加上各个需要检修的单位开展协作支援，“你检修我支援，我检修你支援”，更可以调配力量全力增产。谁说检修一定要减产呢？营城煤矿检修设备不是增产四十多吨煤炭吗？
    消极地对待客观困难，并且把这种困难称之常规，使其合法化，这是一种表现；用斗争的办法克服各种困难，创立新的常规，这是另一种态度。在复杂的生产斗争中，我们必须抱着积极的态度，为高产为优质而斗争到底。
