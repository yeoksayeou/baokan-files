Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 13th: Lü Genze, a well-known agricultural labor model in Jilin Province, has been engaged in production labor in the countryside for more than ten years. Utilizing his spare time to study culture and scientific knowledge and conduct agricultural scientific research, he has now transformed from a junior high school graduate into an agricultural science and technology talent with a university level of expertise.

Lü Genze is currently the captain of the Hailand Production Team of the Dongsheng People's Commune in Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. After graduating from junior high school in 1948, he returned to his hometown to participate in agricultural production. Through labor practice, he saw the bright prospects for rural development and strengthened his determination to become a new type of farmer in the countryside. Under the continuous cultivation and education of the Party, he mastered a wealth of agricultural scientific knowledge through hard study and was hired as a researcher by the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Agricultural Science Research Committee. His book, "Questions and Answers on Rice Cultivation Techniques," was published and has been well-received not only by educated youth returning to participate in production but also by rural cadres and farmers.

Lü Genze deeply realizes the need for agricultural science in the countryside, so he always insists on studying agricultural science and technology diligently, and asking questions and studying hard have become habits. Since 1953, he has used his spare time every day and at night to read more than 500 Korean and Chinese political theory and agricultural science and technology books. When encountering difficult problems in self-study, he would go to the Yanbian Agricultural College or the Rice Experimental Farm, more than ten miles away from home, to ask for advice. Jin Runzhi, a teacher in the Crop Cultivation Group of the Agronomy Department of Yanbian Agricultural College, has become his close friend. They have established a teaching contract. In the past two years alone, Lü Genze has consulted Jin Runzhi on more than 100 difficult problems, greatly enriching his agricultural scientific knowledge. Lü Genze learns even more from veteran farmers. Over the past few years, he has learned a complete set of rice production experiences from veteran farmers, including seed selection, seedling cultivation, transplanting, weeding, harvesting, and threshing. Once, when he was experimenting with cold-bed seedling cultivation, a spring frost suddenly struck and froze the rice seedlings. He consulted Zhang Chunjing, an old farmer with more than 30 years of rice production experience. Zhang Chunjing taught him to use a method of warming with cold water, and as a result, the seedlings were saved. This habit of asking questions and studying hard makes him ponder and study whenever he sees something new. Once, after seeing a plant grafting experiment in a movie, he felt it was very good and started experimenting himself. When experimenting, he couldn't find alcohol for disinfection, gauze for bandaging, or wool yarn, so he experimented with garlic skin, which can both disinfect and tighten when dry, and successfully grafted vegetables. He continued this experiment more than 100 times, bringing the survival rate to 100%.

In recent years, Lü Genze has successively conducted a series of experimental research activities, including various rice seedling cultivation methods, hybridization of low-yield early-maturing and high-yield late-maturing rice varieties, interspecific rice hybridization, comparison of various close-planting methods for rice, and investigation of rice water requirements. Many of these projects have been successfully researched or have achieved certain results. Last year, he used the local high-yield late-maturing "Luyu" rice and the low-yield early-maturing "Beihai" rice for hybridization, cultivating a second and third generation of seeds that not only adapt to the short frost-free period in the Yanbian area and can mature early, but also have large ears, many grains, and high yields. His research experiment on the water requirements of local rice in different plots and at various growth stages, which he has recently basically completed, provides scientific data for the planned irrigation of paddy fields throughout the commune and for opening up water sources to expand the area under rice cultivation. In order to enable Lü Genze to systematically master the theory of rice cultivation techniques, after he completed all the courses at the spare-time agricultural school, the commune party committee sent him to Yanbian Agricultural College for further study for half a year this year.

    劳动十年多  学成新农民
    吕根泽苦学苦钻达到大学水平
    据新华社长春13日电　吉林省著名农业劳动模范吕根泽，十多年来一直在农村参加生产劳动，并利用空隙时间学习文化和科学知识，进行农业科学研究，现在已由一个初中毕业生成为一个具有大学水平的农业科学技术人材。
    吕根泽现在是延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县东盛人民公社海兰生产队的队长。他在1948年初中毕业后，回到家乡参加农业生产，通过劳动实践，看清了农村发展的美好前景，坚定了在农村做一个新型农民的决心。在党的不断培养教育下，他通过刻苦学习，掌握了丰富的农业科学知识，被延边朝鲜族自治州农业科学研究委员会聘请为研究员。他编写的“水稻栽培技术问答”一书出版后，不仅受到回乡参加生产的知识青年的欢迎，也引起了广大农村干部和农民的重视。
    吕根泽深刻体会到农村对农业科学的需要，因此始终坚持刻苦学习农业科学技术，好问苦学成为习惯。从1953年以来，他利用每天劳动空隙时间和夜晚，共阅读了五百多本朝鲜文和汉文政治理论和农业科学技术书籍。在自修过程中遇有疑难问题，就到离家十几里路远的延边农学院或水稻试验场去请教。延边农学院农学系作物栽培组教员金润植已成为他的亲密朋友，他们订立了教学合同，仅去年和今年两年，吕根泽就向金润植请教了一百多个疑难问题，大大丰富了农业科学知识。吕根泽更多的是向老农学习，几年来，从老农那里学到了选种、育苗、插秧、除草、收割、打场等一整套水稻生产经验。有一次，他试验用冷床育苗时，春霜突然袭来，把稻秧冻僵了。他就向有着三十多年水稻生产经验的老农张春京请教。张春京教给他用凉水暖的方法，结果把秧苗救活了。这种好问苦学的习惯，使他每看见一件新鲜东西就要琢磨钻研。有一次，他从电影上看到植物嫁接试验后，感到很好，就着手试验起来。试验的时候，找不到消毒用的酒精、包扎用的纱布和绒线，他就试验用既能消毒杀菌，又越干越紧的蒜皮代替，把蔬菜嫁接成功。他把这个试验继续进行了一百多次，使成活率达到100％。
    几年来，吕根泽先后进行了各种水稻育苗方法、水稻低产早熟和高产晚熟品种杂交、异种水稻杂交、水稻各种密植方法对比和水稻需水量调查等一系列的试验研究活动，其中不少项目已研究成功或取得一定成绩。去年他利用当地高产晚熟的“陆羽”水稻和低产早熟的
  “北海”水稻杂交，培育出一种不仅适应延边地区无霜期短可以早熟，而且穗大粒多高产的第二代和第三代种子。他最近基本完成的当地水稻在不同地块和各个生长时期的需水量研究试验，为全公社水田有计划地灌溉，和开辟水源扩大水稻耕种面积，提供了科学资料。公社党委为了让吕根泽系统地掌握水稻栽培技术理论，在他读完业余农业学校的全部课程后，今年还把他送到延边农学院去进修了半年。（附图片）
