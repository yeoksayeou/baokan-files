    The New Staff Officer
    ——A Record of the Cadre Sent Down, Ping Liangde
    At noon on July 5th, Ping Liangde, a theory instructor at the CCP Lingchuan County Committee Theoretical Class in Shanxi Province, neatly wrote a few lines on a clean white sheet of paper: “After listening to Secretary Xing of the County Committee's report on mobilizing to go deep into the front lines, I am very excited. Agriculture is the foundation of the entire national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Nothing can be done without grain. I actively request to go to the front lines. Please approve it, County Committee…” Before he could finish writing his application, a messenger came in: “Teacher Ping! The Organization Department notified you to go to the Organization Department for a meeting immediately.” The messenger turned and left after speaking. Ping Liangde knew the matter was urgent, so he stopped writing, picked up his unfinished material, and hurried to the Organization Department's office. "Minister Lian, what's the meeting about?" he asked Director Lian Yuxi of the Organization Department as soon as he entered. After Minister Lian explained that the County Committee had decided to send him down to the Third Production Team of the Houshan Management Area of Fucheng Commune as the deputy captain, Ping Liangde was very happy. He handed his written material to Lian Yuxi and only said one sentence: “Please let the leaders judge my work performance.”
    The next day, before dawn, Ping Liangde had prepared everything. After breakfast, he carried his rolled-up luggage and went straight to the Houshan Management Area. When he arrived, the Party Branch Secretary Niu Shuifu greeted him, and Ping Liangde said: “According to the leader’s decision, I’m here to be the deputy captain of a production team in your area…” Before he could finish, Niu Shuifu happily said: “That’s great, we need someone like you.”
    The work of this management area was considered relatively outstanding in Fucheng Commune, but the only shortcoming was that one of the four production teams in the area had consistently lagged behind in recent years. This was the Third Production Team. Ping Liangde knew about this situation. When he asked the Branch Secretary to quickly assign him to the Third Production Team, Niu Shuifu hesitated. He thought the backward team had many difficulties and heavy tasks, and wanted to keep the Third Team for the management area cadres to take charge of, and let Ping Liangde go to the Second Team, which was doing better. "No, I am determined to settle in the Third Team." After Ping Liangde explained to the Branch Secretary, he got the Branch Secretary's approval and immediately took his luggage to the Third Team.

      Total Takeover – Unable to Shoulder the Burden
    When the commune members heard that a new captain had arrived, they were very happy. They chattered, saying: “Things will be easier now. In the future, no matter what happens, we can ask Old Ping. He’s a county cadre, has more experience, and knows more. We don’t have to worry about anything not being handled properly.” When Captain Yao Youbao heard these reactions from the commune members, he was also very happy, thinking: Old Ping is a county cadre, and he has more experience than I do. From now on, I can rely on him for the team's work, and I can relax a bit!
    “No matter what, we have to work hard,” Ping Liangde thought to himself, getting anxious. He went to the captain to understand the situation. He listened to the captain’s introduction and jotted down in his notebook: The team has eighty households, three hundred people, sixty male, female, full and auxiliary laborers, thirteen livestock, and cultivates nine hundred mu of autumn fields… Later, he went to the fields and saw that the autumn fields of the First, Second, and Fourth Teams had all been top-dressed and weeded twice, and the seedlings were growing lush and green. But after inspecting the land of the Third Team, it was very different from the other teams. Not a single mu had been weeded twice, and the fertilizer was still piled in the fields. "It's really backward. Why is there such a big difference in the same management area?" Ping Liangde, sweating, said anxiously as he walked.
    At noon, when the commune members were eating in the canteen, he took the opportunity to start a mobilization report to them: “Comrades, we cannot always be content with being backward. We must have ambition and determination, and be determined to catch up with the advanced teams…” The team cadres saw Ping Liangde inspecting and mobilizing, taking over everything, and said aside: Old Ping is a capable person, things depend on him, let's have a great movement to practice thrift! (Meaning they didn't need to worry about the team's work anymore) Ping Liangde thought: The task the Party gave me is to change the backward team, and this burden must be shouldered. So, he got up every day before dawn, "Go to the fields! Go to the fields! It's already daylight..." Knocking on doors, calling the commune members to go to the fields, and besides handling the team's sporadic affairs all day long, he took time to go to the fields, and dealt with things as they arose. As a result of the total takeover, the original team cadres had lighter and lighter burdens, while his own burden became heavier and heavier. The commune members came to him for everything. Once, the commune members sent fertilizer to the fields and asked him to count it. As a result, more and more trivial matters came up. This one was looking for him, that one was looking for him, and he couldn't rest at noon and couldn't sleep until twelve o'clock at night.
    Twenty days passed. The management area held a small evaluation meeting. At the meeting, Ping Liangde shared his experience of working hard, but what about production? The Third Team was still more than ten days behind the other teams in farm work. Ping Liangde began to feel distressed. He said to Niu Shuifu, the Party Branch Secretary of the Management Area: “I’ve put in a lot of effort, but I still haven’t made a name for myself. It’s really not easy.” After listening to him, Shuifu pondered for a long time and said to him: “Old Ping, you have indeed put in a lot of effort, but you haven’t grasped the key. Think about it, how can you carry a thousand-jin burden on one person?” After listening to the Branch Secretary, Old Ping felt greatly enlightened. Although he was a little distressed for a while, he finally understood a principle: to do a good job, you must give play to the role of all the team cadres.

    Acting as Advisor – Everything Goes Smoothly
    Ping Liangde accepted the lessons from his previous work and decided to change his working methods, helping the team cadres find ways to improve their leadership and give play to everyone’s strength in carrying out the work.
    The ten-day competition movement for wheat field preparation work began. Deputy Captain Wang Baorou, as usual, gathered the commune members and led them to the fields to accumulate fertilizer. But he had no idea how to complete all the current tasks of accumulating fertilizer, transporting fertilizer, cultivating land, and leveling the land in ten days. He did what he could as he went along. Because each movement was such a blind deployment of troops, the captain was often exhausted and the task was not completed. What was the reason? Ping Liangde was not as anxious as before, but carefully pondered the matter. From the phenomenon of random deployment of troops, he saw that the main problem was the lack of planning. So, he helped the captain and the accountant, spending half a day arranging the current farm work and arranging the labor force according to the urgency and importance of the tasks. The political captain led eighteen laborers to accumulate 15,000 dan of fertilizer in ten days; Deputy Captain Cao Yongyong led six laborers and six flatbed carts to level the land in twenty-eight mu of old wheat fields; and Captain Yao Youbao led eight laborers to transport fertilizer in shifts in the morning and afternoon. Various quotas were set and an acceptance system was established. In this way, everyone投入了 into the movement in an orderly manner, and labor efficiency increased by 20% compared to before. The commune members reflected: The captains have grown in ability, and this move is really beautiful.
    On another occasion, Captain Yao Youbao said dejectedly: “There’s really no way, no matter how much I criticize, they just don’t show up for work.” He was referring to Old Granny Feng Jingxiu. In order to find out what was going on, Ping Liangde visited Old Granny Feng Jingxiu. It turned out that this old granny had always loved labor, but she liked to take small advantages. Once, she took something from the team, and the captain criticized her in front of the masses. Another time, she didn’t go to the fields and didn’t ask for leave, so the captain asked her to make a public self-criticism. As a result, she was criticized so severely that she had been sulking for more than a year, from last year to this year, and had not been working in the fields. Ping Liangde knew that this was caused by improper working methods. In addition to expressing his determination to improve his leadership style to Granny Feng, he patiently persuaded her in many ways and mobilized her to work in the fields. In this way, Granny Feng's thinking became clear, and she went to the fields to participate in labor early the next morning. At this time, Ping Liangde asked Captain Yao Youbao to praise her at the meeting. When Granny Feng heard herself praised, she was immediately moved and stood up and said: "Captain, as long as you believe that I still have some value, I will never lose face. From today on, let's compete and see who gets up early and works diligently in the fields." Indeed, Granny Feng worked hard every day, actively participating in field labor, and worked thirty workdays in a month. The transformation of Feng Jingxiu greatly inspired the team cadres. Captain Yao Youbao said: "Don't look at problems with one eye. You must see both the shortcomings and the advantages." Since then, the work style of the team cadres has greatly changed, and the relationship between the commune members and the cadres has become closer. Ping Liangde also increasingly felt that cultivating and improving the work ability of the team cadres was the main key to doing a good job.
    In going deep into field labor, Ping Liangde adhered to using both his hands and his brain, often talking to the commune members and listening to their opinions. After the weeding was over, he found the commune member Hou Xianfu to try to get an idea of what kind of farm work was good to do next. Hou Xianfu was a straightforward person, and when Ping Liangde asked, he said bluntly: “Your team cadres, if you want to do something right, our village hasn't thoroughly cleaned the ditches since 1952. If this item is completed, we can accumulate tens of thousands of dan of fertilizer.” Ping Liangde felt that this opinion was very correct, so he went to discuss it with Captain Yao Youbao. When Youbao heard it, he said impatiently: "If we listen to one person's words, we'll make a big move. I'm afraid it's too blind!" Ping Liangde knew that Youbao didn't accept the opinions of the masses well and didn't dare to rely on the masses boldly, so he organized the team cadres to study Chairman Mao's documents on going from the masses to the masses. This deeply educated everyone, and finally, after everyone's research, according to the commune members' opinions, a five-day blitz was carried out, so that all the soil ridges were scraped and the grass was pulled from the stone ridges. After the ditch cleaning work was completed, the commune held a meeting to deploy the green manure. This team had already run ahead and received praise from the commune. The team cadres who had originally disagreed with this approach said: “In the past, we only knew how to look up, not down. This time we listened to the masses, and we took the initiative in our work. The mass line is really invincible.” The team cadres further understood the importance of taking the mass line through the fact that they relied on the masses to do a good job. In order to be able to hear the opinions of the masses often, everyone also organized a "Zhuge Liang" group among the masses to help the team cadres continuously improve their work style and do a good job.

      General Appraisal – Winning the Big Red Flag
    In mid-August, the management area held a summer work summary meeting. In the summary, Party Branch Secretary Niu Shuifu especially pointed out that the Third Team had done a very good job in production. The late-stage processing of the autumn fields had surpassed the other three advanced production teams. The land that other teams had hoeed three times was generally 50%-80%, while the Third Team, in addition to hoeing three times, had hoeed 24% four times, and applied five more dan of topdressing fertilizer per mu than other teams. The wheat field preparation work was done well. For the two hundred mu of wheat fields, the original plan was to accumulate two hundred dan of fertilizer per mu, but they actually completed two hundred and fifty dan. The work style of the team cadres was thorough and meticulous. They were able to rely on the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and scientifically arrange the work, thereby further giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Labor efficiency increased by 20% to 30% compared to before, and the attendance rate also reached 92% from the original maximum of 70%.
    At the end of the work summary, Niu Shuifu mentioned the issue of awarding red flags. Everyone said in unison: The red flag should be awarded to the Third Team. The Third Team had never won a red flag before. The commune members were very happy to win the red flag this time, and Ping Liangde smiled happily.

### 新来的参谋——记下放干部平良德

    新来的参谋
    ——记下放干部平良德
    7月5日中午，中共山西省陵川县委理论班理论教员平良德，在一张洁白的纸上很整齐地写下了几行字：“听了县委邢书记关于动员深入第一线的报告，我很兴奋。农业是整个国民经济的基础，粮食又是基础的基础，没有粮食可就什么都办不成。我积极要求到第一线去，请县委批准……。”他这个申请还没有写完，通讯员进来了：“平老师！组织部通知你马上到组织部开会。”通讯员说罢返身就走。平良德知道事情紧急，也随手停下笔，拿着自己还没有写好的材料，急匆匆地走进组织部办公室，“连部长，开什么会？”他一进门就向组织部连玉玺部长发问。经过连部长向他说明，县委决定下放他到附城公社后山管理区第三生产队担任副队长职务时，平良德十分高兴，他将自己写的材料递给连玉玺，只说了这么一句话：“请领导上看我的工作表现”。
    第二天天还不亮，平良德就准备好了一切。吃罢早饭，背着早已卷好的行李，直奔后山管理区。来到管理区，党支部书记牛水富和他打过招呼后，平良德说：“根据领导决定，我到咱们区里的生产队当副队长来了……”没等他说完，牛水富便高兴地说：“再好不过了，正少你这么一个人”。
    这个管理区的工作，在附城公社来说，是比较出色的，但美中不足的地方，是全区四个生产队，有一个生产队，几年来一直赶不上来，这就是第三生产队。这个情况平良德是知道的。当他向支部书记要求赶快确定他到第三生产队时，牛水富却有点犹豫。他认为落后队困难多，任务大，想把三队留下来，由管理区干部包干领导，让平良德到工作较好的二队去工作。“不行，我决心到三队落户”。平良德向支书解释后，得到支书同意，随即拿着行李到三队去了。
      大包揽——挑不起担子
    社员们一听说新队长来了，都很高兴，三三两两吵着说：“事情好办了，今后不论啥事，咱都可以找找老平，人家是县干部，经得多，知得宽，啥事情也不愁给咱办不妥。”队长姚有保听到社员这些反映，也十分开心地想：老平是县干部，经也比咱经得多，今后队内工作可就有了靠山，可该咱松散松散啦！
    “不论怎么样，工作得狠狠抓一下。”平良德心里琢磨着，急得发慌，便找队长了解情况。他一面听队长介绍，一边随手在笔记本上记下了：全队八十户，三百口人，男女全半辅劳力六十个，牲口十三头，耕种秋田九百亩……。后来，他到地里看了一下，一队、二队、四队的秋田都施过了追肥，锄耧过二遍，苗子长得黑油油的。可是验看了三队的土地，却与其它队大不相同，二遍没锄过一亩，肥料还在地里堆着。“真够落后了。为什么同在一个管理区，差别这样大？”平良德脸上冒着汗珠，急得满脸通红地边走边说。
    中午时分，社员们正在食堂吃饭，他就趁这个机会，向社员们开始了动员报告：“同志们，我们不能一直甘心落后，要树雄心，立壮志，决心赶上先进队……”队干部们看到平良德又检查又动员，一切都包揽了起来，就在一旁说：老平是个能干家，事情靠他办，咱们来个大兴节约之风吧！（意思是队的工作再不用多操心了）平良德却这样想：党交给的任务，是改变落后队，这个担子非担起来不行。于是，他每天天不明就起床，“上地啦！上地啦！天已经大明……”按门逐户呼唤社员上地，整天价除处理队里零星事务外，抽空就下田，遇事就处理。大包大揽的结果，原来的队干部担子越来越轻，他自己的担子却越来越重，社员们不论什么事情，都要找他来说。有一次社员往地里送了肥，也叫他去点数。这样，琐碎事越来越多，这个也找，那个也找，闹得他每天中午不休息，黑夜到十二点还睡不了觉。
    二十天时间过去了，管理区开了小段评比会议，会上平良德交流了自己实干苦干的经验，但生产怎样呢？三队仍比其它队农活迟了十多天。平良德开始有些苦恼了，他向管理区党支部书记牛水富说：“出了个九牛二虎之力，还是没搞出个名堂来，真是不容易。”水富听了他的话，思谋了半天，对他说：“老平，力气确实出得不小，但没有抓住纲，你想，千斤担子挑在一个人身上，那怎么能行？”老平听了支书的话，心里大大开朗了，虽然一时有些苦恼，但总算明确了一个道理：要搞好工作，必须发挥全体队干部的作用。
    当参谋——事事都顺手
    平良德接受了前段工作教训，决定改变工作方法，帮助队干部设法提高领导水平，发挥大家力量来进行工作。
    麦田准备工作的十天竞赛运动开始了，副队长王保肉又和往常一样，把社员们集中起来，带着下田积肥去了。但究竟在十天内怎样把当前积肥、运肥、耕地、平整土地等几项工作全部完成，心里没有数，做到那算那。正因为每次运动是这样盲目用兵，所以经常是队长累坏了，任务完不成。原因在什么地方呢？平良德不像往常那样着急了，而是细细地琢磨起来，他从乱点兵的现象中，看到的问题主要是工作无计划。于是，他就帮助队长和会计，用了半天时间，把当前农活排了一下队，按任务缓急、轻重安排了劳动力。由政治队长带领十八个劳力，十天积肥一万五千担，由副队长曹永永带领六个劳力和六辆平车，在二十八亩老麦田里平整土地；由正队长姚有保带领八个劳力，上下午轮班运肥。并确定了各种定额，规定了验收制度。这样，大家都很有条理地投入了运动，劳动效率较前提高20％，社员们纷纷反映：队长们增长了才干，这一手搞得真漂亮。
    又有一次，队长姚有保十分懈气地说：“真没办法，怎样批评，也不出勤。”原来是指冯景秀老大娘说的。平良德为了了解个究竟，走访了冯景秀老大娘。原来这个老大娘，一贯热爱劳动，但爱占小便宜，有一次取了社里一点东西，队长就在群众面前批评了她一顿。又一次没上地也没请假，队长就叫她当众检讨。这样，就被批评倒了，去年到今年一年多时间，赌气一直没有上地劳动。平良德知道这是工作方法不当造成的，除向冯大娘表示决心改进领导作风外，多方面进行了耐心说服，动员她上地。这样一来，冯景秀思想通了，第二天一早就下田参加了劳动。这时候，平良德就让队长姚有保在大会上作了表扬，冯大娘一听表扬自己，感动得立即站起来说：“队长，只要你相信我还有点成色，我就绝不会丢这个人。从今天起，咱俩比一比，看谁起得早，上地勤。”真的，冯景秀每天都是起早搭黑，积极参加田间劳动，一个月内做了三十个劳动日。冯景秀的转变，对队干部启发很大。队长姚有保说：“凡事不要一个眼睛看问题，既要看到缺点，也要看到优点。”从此，队干部的作风大大改变了，社员同干部的关系更密切了。平良德也越来越觉得培养提高队干部工作能力，是搞好工作的主要关键。
    平良德在深入田间劳动中，坚持了动手、动脑，经常和社员谈心，听取群众意见。”薅地结束了，他找到社员侯先富想摸个底细，看当前农活搞什么好。侯先富是个直爽的人，当平良德一问，他就直截了当地说：“你们队干部，要办个正事，咱村从1952年以来，就没有彻底打??，这一项闹下来，就能积十几万担肥。”平良德觉得这个意见很对，就去和队长姚有保商量。有保一听，有些不耐烦地说：“听上一个人的话，就大动杀法，恐怕太盲动吧！”平良德知道有保接受群众意见差，不敢大胆依靠群众，就组织队干部，学习了毛主席关于论从群众中来到群众中去的文件。这样深刻教育了大家，最后经过大家研究，按照社员意见，搞了五天大突击，做到了土堎全部刮，石堎把草拔。打??工作结束了，公社召开了会议部署打草压青，这个队已经跑在了前面，得到了公社的表扬。原来不同意这样搞的队干部们说：“以前咱只知眼睛向上，不知向下，这次听了群众的话，工作取得了主动权。群众路线真是无往不胜。”队干部通过依靠群众做好工作的事实，进一步懂得了走群众路线的重要性，为了经常能够听到群众意见，大家还在群众中组织了一个“诸葛亮”小组，帮助队干部不断改进作风，搞好工作。
      总评比——夺得大红旗
    8月中旬，管理区召开了夏季工作总结大会。在总结中，党支部书记牛水富特别指出了三队生产搞得很出色，秋田后期加工都超过了其他三个先进生产队别的队锄苗三次的土地一般在50％—80％，三队除普锄三次外，24％锄过了四遍，追肥也比其它队每亩多施五担。麦田准备工作搞得好，二百多亩麦田，原计划每亩积肥二百担，实际完成二百五十担。队干部的工作作风深入细致，能依靠群众，听取群众意见，科学安排工作，从而进一步发挥了群众的积极性，劳动效率较前提高20％到30％，出勤率也由原出勤最多的70％达到了92％。
    牛水富在总结工作的末尾，提到评红旗的问题。大家都不约而同地说：红旗该评给第三队。第三队从来没得过红旗，这次夺得了红旗，社员们都很高兴，平良德也乐得眯眯地笑了。
