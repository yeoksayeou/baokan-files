Beigong Production Team Vigorously Develops Winter Sideline Occupations to Make Up for Flood Losses

(Reported by this newspaper) The Beigong Production Team of Hancun Commune, Xian County, Hebei Province, after basically completing the autumn harvest and planting, is vigorously developing diversified operations in winter to make up for the losses caused by the floods this year.

The Beigong Production Team suffered severe flooding this year, which brought some difficulties to the lives of the members and next year's agricultural production. Facing these difficulties, what should we do? Should we simply rely on state relief, or should we rely on self-reliance? At that time, there were two opinions among the masses. The majority of the members advocated making full use of the winter slack season to vigorously develop sideline production, in order to solve the current difficulties in life and prepare for next year's agricultural production. However, a few people held the opposite view. They emphasized the severity of the disaster, the lack of funds, and the lack of equipment, and advocated asking the state for loans and materials. The Party branch firmly supported the former view. In order to strengthen the masses' confidence in overcoming the disaster, the Party branch, on the one hand, analyzed the favorable conditions for vigorously developing sideline production together with the members, and on the other hand, carefully studied the ways to develop sideline occupations, the sources of raw materials, and the arrangement of labor. After clarifying the situation, the team quickly took action. By obtaining raw materials locally and signing processing contracts with commercial departments, it found sixteen sideline production channels such as processing wood, weaving baskets, making sugar, and making tinder. It also made plans for repairing and manufacturing small and medium-sized agricultural tools needed for next year's production. Completing these production plans would basically solve the material and financial needs of the team in arranging production and life. As a result, the few people who originally emphasized difficulties and advocated relying on the state also changed their views and actively engaged in sideline production.

After the sideline production was launched, some people only paid attention to grasping large-scale production and did not pay attention to small-scale production. They said, "Large-scale production quenches thirst," and "Scattered small-scale production cannot solve any problems." Under the influence of this idea, only seven larger-scale sideline productions such as processing wood and weaving strips were launched at that time. In response to this situation, the Party branch further educated the members to grasp both "watermelons" and pick up "sesame seeds," so as to give full play to the enthusiasm of the production team, small team, and members' families. With clearer thinking, not only were the original sixteen sideline productions launched, but also nine new channels were expanded.

Is it for organizing people's lives, developing agricultural production, and expanding reproduction that we vigorously develop diversified operations, or is it simply for profit? This question was initially not clear enough in the minds of some people. For example, the team's wood factory initially only wanted to earn more cash and was unwilling to repair and manufacture agricultural tools needed for the team's production next year. Therefore, the Party branch guided everyone to consider the overall situation and educated cadres and members to combine current interests with long-term interests, and partial interests with overall interests. This reversed the purely profit-oriented view of a few people, making the policy of diversified operations serving both the people's lives and agricultural production clearer. The wood factory has changed from mainly producing commodities for sale to mainly repairing and manufacturing agricultural tools. At present, it has repaired and manufactured more than 1,000 pieces of various agricultural tools, providing material conditions for next year's spring plowing.

In order to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of all parties, the team rationally divided the business scope of sideline production among the production team, small team, and members. It was determined that large-scale productions such as wood factories, sugar factories, tinder processing factories, and saltpeter factories, which are fixed year-round, require a lot of manpower, and generate large incomes, should be operated uniformly by the production team; small-scale sideline occupations that require less manpower, generate smaller incomes, and are easy to combine with agricultural production, such as making brooms and weaving baskets, should be operated by the small team; scattered small-scale sideline occupations, such as spinning old cotton and weaving straw braids, should be operated by individual members under the principle of not affecting collective production. The production team helps to arrange the small team's and households' scattered sideline production appropriately, and gives consideration to raw materials and sales as much as possible.

In terms of income distribution, the sideline income of the production team is distributed uniformly with agriculture, and appropriate subsidies are given to personnel with higher technical levels. A small portion of the sideline income of the production small team is handed over to the production team for unified distribution, and the remaining portion is retained as the small team's accumulation, and the majority is given to the members. The income from scattered sideline occupations engaged by members in their spare time belongs entirely to the members.

    广开生产门路　划分经营范围
    北宫生产队大搞冬季副业弥补涝灾损失
    本报讯　河北献县韩村公社北宫生产队，在秋收秋种基本完成以后，为弥补今年遭受涝灾损失，领导群众大搞冬季多种经营。
    北宫生产队今年遭受了严重的涝灾，给社员生活和明年农业生产带来一些困难。针对这些困难怎么办？是单纯依赖国家救济，还是依靠自力更生？在群众中当时有两种主张。多数社员主张利用冬闲大搞副业生产，来解决当前生活上的困难，并为明年农业生产做好准备。但是，有少数人和这种看法相反。他们强调灾情重，缺资金，少设备，主张向国家贷款、要物资。党支部坚决支持前一种主张，为了坚定群众战胜灾荒的信心，党支部一面和社员群众一道分析了大搞副业生产的有利条件，一面认真研究了开展副业的门路、原料的来源和劳力安排等问题。摸清底数以后，这个队就迅速行动，通过就地取材组织原料和与商业部门签订加工合同，找到了加工木材、编筐、制糖、制火绒等十六种副业生产门路。对明年生产所需的中小农具，也做出了修理制造计划。完成这些生产计划基本上能够解决本队在安排生产、生活方面所需要的物资和资金。这样一来，原来强调困难，主张依赖国家的少数人也改变了看法，积极投入了副业生产。
    副业生产开展起来以后，有些人只注意抓大宗生产，把小宗生产不放在眼里。他们说：“大宗解渴，”“零零星星解决不了什么问题。”在这种思想影响下，当时只开展起加工木材、编条等七种较大宗的副业生产。针对这种情况，党支部又教育社员们要既抓“西瓜”，又拣“芝麻”，这样才能充分发挥生产队、小队和社员家庭的积极性。大家思想明确了，不但原订的十六种副业生产都开展起来，而且还扩大了九种门路。
    大搞多种经营，是为组织人民生活、为发展农业生产、为扩大再生产服务呢？还是单纯为了盈利？这个问题，起初在一部分人的思想上是不够明确的。譬如，这个队的木厂开始时光愿多收入现钱，不愿修理和制造队里明年生产所需用的农具。党支部于是引导大家算大账，教育干部和社员从全局出发，把目前利益和长远利益、局部利益和整体利益结合起来。这样就扭转了少数人的单纯盈利观点，使多种经营既为人民生活服务，也为农业生产服务的方针更加明确了。木厂由原来以生产卖现钱的商品为主，现已改为以修理、制造农具为主，目前已修制各种农具一千多件，为明年春耕准备了物资条件。
    为了充分调动各方面的生产积极性，这个队在生产队、小队、社员之间，合理划分了副业生产的经营范围。确定：常年固定、用人多、收入大的木厂、糖厂、火绒加工厂、硝厂等大宗生产，由生产队统一经营；占人少、收入较小，又便于和农业生产结合的小型副业，如扎扫帚、编篓等由小队经营；零星的小型副业，如纺旧棉、稻草辫等由社员个人在不影响集体生产的原则下经营。生产小队和各户的零星副业生产，由生产队帮助适当安排，并尽可能在原料、销售等方面给以照顾。
    在收益分配上，生产队的副业收入与农业统一分配，对技术水平较高的人员，给予适当补贴。生产小队的副业收入，上交生产队一小部分统一分配，其余部分留一小部分做为小队积累，大部分给社员。社员在业余时间搞的零星副业收入，完全归社员所有。（附图片）
