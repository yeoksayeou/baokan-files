Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd, Washington Dispatch: As American imperialism intensifies its conspiracy for armed intervention in Cuba on all fronts, U.S. President Eisenhower yesterday issued another statement reiterating the U.S. determination to occupy its Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba as a bridgehead for direct military threats against Cuba. He clamored that, in this regard, "the United States will take any appropriate steps."

In his statement, Eisenhower insisted on the "right" to occupy the Guantanamo base obtained from the unequal treaty that the United States forced Cuba to sign after sending troops to occupy Cuba in 1903. He declared, "Our government has no intention of agreeing to modify or repeal these agreements and will take any appropriate steps to defend these bases."

Eisenhower specifically stated that the United States is currently occupying this base to deal with the so-called communist "threat." As everyone knows, the United States is currently preparing for armed aggression against Cuba under the guise of opposing the so-called "communist threat." He also threatened, "Due to its importance in defending the entire (Western) Hemisphere, especially given the close relationship that now exists between the current Cuban government and the Sino-Soviet bloc, it is very necessary to clearly understand our attitude regarding Guantanamo."

On the same day, former U.S. President Truman also issued hostile clamors against Cuba. Truman stated that the United States cannot allow a regime that opposes American imperialism to exist "within ninety miles of the American coast." He supported the claims of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy, advocating that the United States should vigorously strengthen the so-called "anti-Castro forces" to conspire to overthrow the Cuban revolutionary government.

    艾森豪威尔又发表侵略性声明
    叫嚣要长期霸占关塔那摩
    作武装侵略古巴的桥头堡
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：当美帝国主义正在各方面加紧阴谋武装干涉古巴的时候，美国总统艾森豪威尔昨天又发表一项声明，重申美国决心霸占它在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地，作为直接军事威胁古巴的桥头堡。他叫嚷说，在这方面，“美国将采取任何适当的步骤”。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中坚持1903年美国出兵占领古巴后强迫古巴签订的不平等条约中取得的霸占关塔那摩基地的“权利”。他声称，“我们的政府无意同意修改或废除这些协定，并将采取任何适当的步骤来保卫这些基地”。
    艾森豪威尔并且特别说明，美国目前霸占这一基地是要对付所谓共产主义“威胁”。人们知道，美国目前正是一直在反对所谓“共产主义威胁”的幌子下，准备武装侵略古巴的。他还恫吓说，“由于它（关塔那摩）对保卫整个（西）半球的重要性，特别鉴于古巴现政府和中苏集团之间现在存在的亲密关系，使人明确了解我们关于关塔那摩的态度是非常必要的”。
    同一天，前美国总统杜鲁门也发出了敌视古巴的叫嚣。杜鲁门表示美国不能在“距离美国海岸九十英里之内”容许一个反对美帝国主义的政权存在。他支持美国民主党总统候选人肯尼迪的主张，鼓吹美国要大力加强所谓“反卡斯特罗的力量”来阴谋推翻古巴革命政府。
