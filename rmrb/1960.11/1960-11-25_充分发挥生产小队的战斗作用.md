    Give Full Play to the Combat Role of Production Teams

    The production team is the most basic organizational unit of the people's commune, and also the most basic combat unit on the agricultural production front, shouldering the most direct and specific tasks of organizing commune members' production and arranging their lives. The Party's various guidelines and policies must meet the masses and be implemented specifically through the production team. Whether the work of the production team is good or not, whether the organization is sound or not, and whether the combat effectiveness is strong or not, are the decisive factors in whether the Party's guidelines and policies can be implemented and whether the production cause of the people's commune can develop faster. Therefore, when summarizing the experience of the commune in winter, attention should be paid to summarizing the experience of the production team, striving to strengthen the production team, and giving full play to the combat role of the production team in developing production and organizing commune members' lives.

    From where should we start to strengthen the production team in order to give fuller play to its combat role? Many places have accumulated a wealth of experience in this regard. These experiences can be summarized into the following aspects:

    First, labor, land, draft animals, and farm tools must be resolutely fixed, and no one may arbitrarily transfer them.

    Fighting a war requires an army. The production team is a unit directly fighting on the agricultural front, and it first needs sufficient labor. The Party Central Committee has repeatedly pointed out that "concentrating the main labor force to strengthen the front line of agricultural production," and the front line of agricultural production is the production team of the people's commune. These instructions from the Central Committee are to strengthen and enrich the production team with more and better labor. Only when the production team has a sufficient number and quality of labor can its labor production capacity be greatly improved and production tasks can be completed better and faster. At present, according to the Party Central Committee's policy of the whole Party and the whole people running agriculture in a big way and running food in a big way, all localities are adjusting labor from all aspects and transferring more labor to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. Party organizations and rural people's communes in various places should take effective measures to ensure that the most important force is truly placed in the production team.

    The production team is the unit that directly carries out production. Production requires tools and draft animals. After communization, due to the continuous leap forward in agricultural production and the strong support of the state, many people's communes have added many new farm tools and some agricultural machinery, which is an important factor in accelerating agricultural development, and the huge role of these tools in production should be fully utilized. Some of these new tools and agricultural machinery are only suitable for unified use by communes and production brigades, while others are suitable for decentralized use by production teams. Small tools and agricultural machinery that are suitable for decentralized use by production teams should be assigned to production teams for fixed use. The same is true for draft animals. It is more convenient and beneficial to fix them for the team to feed, manage, and use than to concentrate them in the production brigade or commune. This can feed the draft animals better, use them better, and breed them faster.

    The entire process of agricultural production is a process of fighting against nature, which is very complicated. To fight a war, one must "know oneself and the enemy" in order to "win every battle." Agricultural production, due to its long production cycle, strong continuity, and greater influence from nature, requires familiarity with its conditions and laws in order to promote its faster and smoother development. Under the overall arrangement of the commune and the production brigade, fixing the land for the production team to use will allow the team to rationally arrange stubble and carry out rotation according to the characteristics of production continuity; and to carry out soil improvement, fertilization, deep plowing, etc. that meet the needs according to the understanding of the soil quality. These measures are undoubtedly very necessary for accelerating agricultural development.

    The experience of many places has proved that fixing labor, land, draft animals, and farm tools for the production team is a prerequisite for giving full play to the combat role of the team and promoting the rapid development of agricultural production. In Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, the Dayou People's Commune has a Fengtaiping Production Brigade. As early as the mutual aid group era, Fengtaiping organized four mutual aid groups; after cooperation, the four mutual aid groups became the four production teams of the agricultural cooperative; after communization, the Fengtaiping Advanced Agricultural Cooperative became the Fengtaiping Production Brigade of the Dayou People's Commune, and the original four production teams became the four production teams of the Fengtaiping Production Brigade. Over the years, the personnel changes in each team have been very small, and the land and cattle have not changed much since they were adjusted once after cooperation. Especially after communization, under the unified management of the commune, the commune insisted on the policy of "four fixings." Within these four production teams, people understand each other and have established close feelings. People are also very familiar with the land, tools, and cattle. A good situation of unity, mutual assistance, and annual production improvement has emerged in the whole team. The commune and the production brigade, based on the characteristic that the conditions of each team are similar, led them to launch a production competition movement to compete for advancement, and established a relationship of mutual assistance on the basis of friendly competition. All of this together formed a huge force to promote production development, increasing the yield per mu of grain from 152 jin in 1951 to 415 jin in 1959, an increase of 1.7 times in nine years. In particular, after communization, the increase in average unit yield was especially rapid, from 189 jin in 1957 to 415 jin in 1959, an increase of 1.2 times in two years. All localities should promote the experience of Fengtaiping in Dayou Commune and earnestly do a good job in the "four fixings" of the production team.

    Second, the production brigade should implement a system of contracted production, contracted labor, contracted costs, and rewards for overproduction for the production team, and the team should do a good job in quota management and work point recording for commune members.

    If doing a good job in "four fixings" is a prerequisite for giving full play to the combat role of the production team, then the "three contracts and one reward" system, quota management, and work point recording are the material guarantees for promoting the production team to play its combat role. We advocate combining political leadership with material guarantees. The "three contracts and one reward" system, quota management, and work point recording are specific guarantees for implementing the principle of distribution according to work under the premise of political leadership. With the three contracts, people have specific goals to strive for and can more fully mobilize everyone's enthusiasm. Rewards after overproduction include both material rewards and political commendations. Commune members feel very honored to receive rewards, which means that they have overfulfilled the tasks assigned to them by the Party and the people's commune, and means that they have made greater contributions to socialist construction. People's communes that have already established the "three contracts and one reward" system must give the production teams that have overfulfilled the "three contracts" tasks the rewards they deserve after the autumn harvest in accordance with regulations. Places that have not yet established this system should earnestly establish this system. The enthusiasm of the collective is built on the enthusiasm of each member of the collective. Doing a good job in quota management and strictly and conscientiously implementing the work point recording system on the basis of quota management can cooperate with political education to further mobilize the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members. After communization, the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members have been unprecedentedly improved. Under this situation, some places have relaxed the quota management and work point recording system, believing that in the case of high labor enthusiasm of the masses, it is no longer necessary to adhere to these systems. This view is not comprehensive. The high awareness and high labor enthusiasm of the masses have created good conditions for better adhering to quota management and work point recording and other management systems, and must never be used as a reason to ignore and abandon these systems. Moreover, in order to keep the enthusiasm of the masses full for a long time, it is necessary to adhere to and continuously improve quota management and work point recording and other systems while adhering to political education.

    Third, it is necessary to improve the leadership work of the commune and the production brigade over the team, and also to improve the leadership work of the team over the commune members.

    To do a good job in the production team and give full play to its combat role, the most important key lies in leadership. Leadership is divided into two aspects: one is the leadership of the production brigade and the commune and the higher-level Party organizations over the production team, and the other is the leadership of the cadres and Party organizations of the production team over all members of the team. In addition to continuously strengthening ideological and political work, the core issue of the leadership of the commune, the production brigade, and the higher-level Party organizations over the production team is to conscientiously implement the Party's guidelines and policies, especially when implementing the policy of "three-level ownership with the team as the basis," it is necessary to earnestly ensure the "partial ownership" of the production team. The production team has the right to plant according to local conditions, formulate technical measures, and arrange various farm work on the premise of ensuring the completion of production tasks. On the premise of ensuring the completion of production tasks, the production team can make full use of field edges and other idle land to plant various crops and operate forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery production. The income, except for a small portion handed over to the production brigade for unified distribution, is mostly owned by the team; the team can also extract a small portion from it as its own public accumulation, and most of it is distributed to the members of the team. In this way, within a production brigade, the food ration standards, wage levels, and labor day values ​​of each team will be high and low. This difference is completely reasonable, has a role in encouraging backwardness to catch up with advanced competition, and is beneficial to the development of production. Only when these tasks are done well can the "four fixings" of the production team be truly established, and the "three contracts and one reward" system, quota management, and work point recording established on the basis of "four fixings" can be implemented.

    To improve the leadership core of the team, select those who have good composition, high ideological awareness, are fair, are good at following the mass line, and can thoroughly implement the "four togethers" with the commune members to serve as the branch secretary, team leader, and deputy team leader of the production team, and form the leadership core of the team by them, can truly do a good job in various tasks of the whole team. We must not neglect the selection of team cadres and the training and education of team cadres because the production team is "small." Although the scope of the production team is small, the tasks are specific and the work is numerous. All the Party's guidelines and policies must meet the masses through the team, and all the work of the commune and the production brigade must take root and be specifically implemented in the team; and the demands, aspirations, and opinions of the masses are also reflected upward through the team. How can the complex and heavy work of the team be done well without improving the leadership of the team and strengthening the leadership core of the team? Recently, in response to the call of the Party Central Committee to run agriculture in a big way and run food in a big way, Party committees in various places have transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside and the commune to strengthen the agricultural front. This is a very favorable condition for us to strengthen the production team. In addition to earnestly participating in labor and helping team cadres do a good job in current work, they should also earnestly help team cadres improve their work ability and improve various systems of the team.

    The production team is the grass-roots organization of the commune, one of the important keys to further improving the people's commune system and consolidating the people's commune, and an important link in promoting the rapid development of agricultural production. In order to further consolidate the commune, run the commune better, and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture next year, rural people's communes in various places must earnestly strengthen the team on the basis of summarizing the experience of the commune, further improve the work of the team, and give full play to the combat role of the production team.

### 充分发挥生产小队的战斗作用

    充分发挥生产小队的战斗作用
    生产小队是人民公社最基层的组织单位，也是农业生产战线上的最基层的战斗单位，它担负着最直接最具体的组织社员生产和安排社员生活的任务。党的各项方针政策都要通过生产小队同群众见面和通过生产小队具体执行。生产小队的工作好不好，组织健全不健全，战斗力是不是很强大，是党的方针政策能不能贯彻，人民公社的生产事业能不能更快地向前发展的决定因素。因此，在冬季总结公社经验的时候，要注意总结生产小队的经验，努力加强生产小队，充分发挥生产小队在发展生产和组织社员生活中的战斗作用。
    从何处着手来加强生产小队，才能更充分地发挥生产小队的战斗作用呢？许多地方，在这方面已经积累了很丰富的经验。这些经验，归纳起来，大体有下述几个方面。
    第一，劳力、土地、耕畜、农具要坚决实行四固定，任何人不得随便调用。
    作战要有军队。生产小队是农业战线上直接作战的部队，它首先需要足够的劳动力。党中央一再指出的“集中主要劳动力加强农业生产第一线”，农业生产的第一线就是人民公社的生产小队；中央这些指示就是要把更多更好的劳动力去加强和充实生产小队。只有生产小队的劳动力有了足够的数量和应有的质量，它的劳动生产能力才能大大提高起来，更好更快地完成生产任务。现在，各地正根据党中央提出的全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的方针，从各方面调整劳动力，抽调出更多的劳动力加强农业生产第一线，各地党组织和农村人民公社应该采取切实措施，保证把最主要的力量真正放到生产小队去。
    生产小队是直接进行生产的单位。生产需要有工具和耕畜。公社化以后，由于农业生产的持续跃进和国家的大力支援，许多人民公社都增添了不少新式农具和部分农业机械，这是加速农业发展的一个重要因素，应该充分发挥这些工具在生产中的巨大作用。这些新式工具和农业机械，有些是只适合公社和生产队统一使用的，也有些是适合生产小队分散使用的。对于那些适合生产小队分散使用的小型工具和农业机械应该交给生产小队固定使用。耕畜也是如此。固定给小队喂养、管理和使用，比集中在生产队或公社有更多的方便和好处，这样做能把耕畜喂得更好，用得更好，繁殖得更快。
    农业生产的全部过程是向大自然作斗争的过程，是很复杂的。作战要“知己知彼”，才能“百战百胜”。农业生产由于生产周期长、连续性强、受自然界影响较大等等特点，更需要熟悉它的条件和规律，才能促使其更迅速和更顺利地发展。在公社和生产队的全面安排下，把土地固定给生产小队使用，小队就可以根据生产连续性的特点，合理地安排茬口，进行轮作；可以根据对土质的了解，进行切合需要的土壤改良、施肥、深耕等等，这些措施，无疑是对加速农业的发展十分需要的。
    很多地方的经验证明，把劳力、土地、耕畜和农具固定给生产小队使用，是充分发挥小队的战斗作用，促进农业生产迅速发展的先决条件。山西武乡县大有人民公社有个凤台坪生产队。远在互助组时代，凤台坪便组织起来四个互助组；合作化后，四个互助组成了农业社的四个生产队；公社化以后，凤台坪高级农业社成了大有人民公社的凤台坪生产队，原来的四个生产队又成了凤台坪生产队的四个生产小队，多年来各个队的人员变动很少，土地、耕牛在合作化以后调整过一次之后，至今也没有大的变动。特别是在公社化以后，在公社的统一经营管理下，公社坚持了“四固定”的政策，这四个生产小队内部，人和人之间互相了解，建立了亲密的感情，人对土地、对工具、对耕牛也很熟悉，出现了全队团结互助、生产年年向上的大好局面。公社和生产队根据各个小队之间由于原来大家条件差不多的特点，领导它们展开了争先进的生产竞赛运动，并在友谊竞赛基础上建立了互相帮助的关系，这一切综合起来，便形成了一股促进生产发展的十分巨大的力量，使粮食的亩产量从1951年的一百五十二斤提高到1959年的四百一十五斤，九年之间，增长一点七倍。特别是公社化以后，平均单位产量的增长尤为迅速，从1957年的一百八十九斤增长到1959年的四百一十五斤，两年间增长一点二倍。各地应该推广大有公社凤台坪的经验，把生产小队的“四固定”工作切实做好。
    第二，生产队对生产小队要实行包产、包工、包成本和超产奖励的制度，小队对社员要作好定额管理和评工记分的工作。
    如果说做好“四固定”工作是充分发挥生产小队的战斗作用的前提条件，那么，“三包一奖”、定额管理和评工记分等制度则是推动生产小队发挥其战斗作用的物质保证。我们主张把政治挂帅和物质保证结合起来，“三包一奖”、定额管理、评工记分制度就是在政治挂帅的前提下实行按劳分配原则的具体保证。有了三包，人们便有了具体的奋斗目标，便能够更充分地调动大家的积极性。超产以后的奖励，既有实物的奖励，也有政治上的表扬。社员们得到奖励，是感到十分光荣的，这意味着超额完成了党和人民公社给予自己的任务，意味着为社会主义建设作出了更大的贡献。已经建立起“三包一奖”制度的人民公社，在秋收后一定要按照规定给予那些超额完成了“三包”任务的生产小队以应得的奖励。还没有建立这一制度的地方，应该把这个制度认真地建立起来。集体的积极性建立在集体中每个成员的积极性的基础上。搞好定额管理，并在定额管理的基础上严格认真地实行评工记分制度，就能够配合政治教育，进一步调动广大社员的劳动积极性。公社化以后，广大社员的政治觉悟和劳动积极性有了空前的提高，在这种情况下，有些地方放松了定额管理和评工记分制度，认为在群众的劳动积极性很高的情况下，仍然坚持这些制度已经是不必要的了。这种看法是不全面的。群众觉悟高，劳动积极性高，是为更好地坚持定额管理和评工记分等经营管理制度创造了良好的条件，绝不能被作为忽视和放弃这些制度的理由，而且为了使群众的积极性长期饱满，在坚持政治教育的同时还必须坚持和不断完善定额管理和评工记分等制度。
    第三，既要改进公社、生产队对小队的领导工作，也要改进小队对社员的领导工作。
    做好生产小队的工作，充分发挥生产小队的战斗作用，最重要的关键还在于领导。领导分两个方面，一个是生产队和公社以及上级党组织对生产小队的领导，一个是生产小队的干部和党组织对小队全体社员的领导。公社、生产队以及上级党组织对生产小队的领导，除了不断地加强思想政治工作以外，核心问题是认真执行党的方针政策，特别是在贯彻执行“三级所有、队为基础”的政策的时候，要认真保证生产小队的“部分所有权”。生产小队在保证完成生产任务的前提下，有权因地种植，有权制定技术措施，有权安排各种农活。生产小队在保证完成生产任务的前提下，可以充分利用田边地角和其他闲散土地，种植各种作物和经营林、牧、副、渔各业生产，其收入除小部分上交给生产队统一分配外，绝大部分归小队所有；小队也可以从中提出小部分作为自己的公共积累，大部分分配给本小队的社员。这样一来，在一个生产队里面，各小队之间的口粮标准、工资水平和劳动日的分值，就会有高有低。这种差别是完全合理的，对鼓励后进赶先进的竞赛运动是有作用的，对于发展生产是有利的。只有这些工作做好了，生产小队的“四固定”工作才能够真正建立起来，在“四固定”基础上建立起来的“三包一奖”、定额管理和评工记分等等制度，才能贯彻实行。
    健全小队的领导核心，挑选那些成份好、思想觉悟高、办事公道、善于走群众路线、能同社员彻底实行“四同”的人担任生产小队的支部书记、小队长和副小队长，并由他们组成小队的领导核心，才能真正作好全小队的各种工作。绝不能因为生产小队“小”而忽视小队干部的挑选和对小队干部的培养与教育。生产小队范围虽小，但任务具体，工作繁多，党的一切方针政策，都要通过小队同群众见面，公社和生产队的一切工作，都要在小队落脚生根，具体执行；而群众的要求、愿望和意见也都是通过小队向上反映。不健全小队的领导，不加强小队的领导核心，怎么可能把小队这样复杂繁重的工作做好呢？最近，各地党委响应党中央提出的大办农业、大办粮食的号召，抽调了大批干部下乡下社，加强农业战线，这是我们加强生产小队的一个十分有利的条件，这些干部除了极少数留在公社、生产队工作外，绝大多数应该到生产小队去，担任支部书记、副书记、小队长或副小队长。他们除了认真参加劳动和帮助小队干部做好当前工作以外，还要认真地帮助小队干部提高工作能力，健全小队的各种制度。
    小队是公社的基层组织，是进一步健全人民公社制度和巩固人民公社的重要关键之一，是促进农业生产迅速发展的重要环节。为了进一步巩固公社，把公社办得更好，争取明年农业大丰收，各地农村人民公社都要在总结公社经验的基础上，认真地加强小队，进一步改进小队的工作，充分发挥生产小队的战斗作用。
