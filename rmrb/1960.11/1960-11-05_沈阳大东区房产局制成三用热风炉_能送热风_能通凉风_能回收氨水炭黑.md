    Shenyang Dadong District Housing Authority Develops Three-Purpose Hot Air Furnace
    Can Send Hot Air, Can Send Cool Air, Can Recover Ammonia and Carbon Black
    (Our Dispatch) The Dadong District Housing Authority in Shenyang organized a three-way combination of workers, cadres, and technicians, and after painstaking research, successfully installed a "three-purpose hot air furnace" in a two-story building. This furnace can send hot air and cool air, keeping the room warm in winter and cool in summer, and can also recover by-products such as ammonia and carbon black.
    Using a hot and cold air furnace can save more than half of the coal. It is suitable in temperature, and the air is fresh, hygienic and safe. Its structure is divided into four systems: coal combustion, cool air or heating, and the recovery of ammonia and carbon black. In order to keep the indoor air fresh, a double-layer fiber dust filter net is set at the cool air vent for the first dust removal. A dust removal water tank is set at the exhaust vent, which can remove the dust contained in the exhausted hot air and humidify the air, so that the exhausted hot air is not dry. In summer, the combustion chamber does not burn, and the air sent into the room is cool air, which can make the indoor air not stuffy.
    The ammonia recovery equipment is installed at the rear of the heating chamber, and the carbon black recovery equipment is located at the rear of the furnace body. The two kinds of by-products recovered can be used as chemical raw materials and agricultural chemical fertilizers. The value of the by-products obtained is equivalent to the cost of burning coal, which can achieve cost-free heating.

    沈阳大东区房产局制成三用热风炉
    能送热风　能通凉风　能回收氨水炭黑
    本报讯　沈阳市大东区房产局组织工人、干部、技术人员三结合，苦心钻研，在一幢二层楼房里，安装成功了“三用热风炉”。这种炉子能送热风，又能通凉风，可使室内冬暖夏凉，还能回收氨水和炭黑等副产品。
    使用冷热风炉可省煤一半以上，用起来温度适宜，空气清新，既卫生又安全。它的构造，共分煤炭燃烧，冷风或加热，回收氨水、炭黑四个系统。为了保持室内空气新鲜，在冷风口处设双层纤维滤尘网，进行第一次除尘。在排风口处设除尘水槽一处，一方面能除掉排出热风中所含的灰尘，一方面加湿空气，使排出热风不干燥。夏季燃烧室不烧火，送进房间的风是凉风，可使室内空气不闷热。
    回收氨水设备，安装在加热室后部，炭黑回收设备位置是在炉体的最后部。回收的二种副产品可供作化学原料和农业化学肥料。所获副产品的代价，相当于烧用煤炭的费用，可达到无成本取暖。
