This winter, rural people's communes have an important task: to properly maintain and repair existing agricultural machinery (including tractors, various power machines, irrigation and drainage machinery, etc.), making them fully equipped. At the same time, they must conduct large-scale inspections, repairs, and manufacture improved agricultural tools and small farm implements to prepare for next year's large-scale production.

With the continuous development of agricultural production, the issue of agricultural machinery and tools is becoming increasingly complex. Farm tools themselves are changing, and the relationship between people and farm tools is also changing. In the era of small-scale farming, the farm tools of poor peasants were very simple; a hoe was passed down through three generations, owned, used, repaired, and managed by oneself. In agricultural production cooperatives, collectively owned farm tools, including some improved farm tools, began to appear, but their numbers were small. Now, people's communes and production teams not only have old-style farm tools but also various improved farm tools and agricultural machinery; not only do commune members have farm tools they own and use themselves, but there are also more and more publicly owned and publicly used farm tools. During the three years of the Great Leap Forward, many farm tools were added, but many were also worn out. Some production teams with relatively poor work, due to the failure to establish strict usage and safekeeping systems for farm tools, left some farm tools scattered in the open, exposed to wind and rain, causing damage. Therefore, people's communes everywhere must first conduct a mass inspection and cleanup of existing agricultural machinery and tools, thoroughly understanding their assets. How much agricultural machinery (including mechanized and semi-mechanized, old and new, publicly and privately owned) does a commune, a production team, or a production brigade now possess? Based on next year's production increase plan, how much labor and how many farm tools are needed in each quarter, considering the amount of labor used and the number of draft animals? Which ones can be repaired? Which ones need to be added? Which ones must be reformed? How much repair, fitting, and manufacturing capacity do we currently have? How much and what kind of raw materials are needed? All of these must be thoroughly investigated. Some communes and production teams, based on the results of investigation and research, have used the mass line method of proposing plans from top to bottom and formulating plans from bottom to top to develop a plan for this winter's farm tool repair and manufacturing. This is a good approach. Since the Great Leap Forward, people's communes in various regions have accumulated a lot of experience in manufacturing, repairing, and maintaining agricultural machinery, especially publicly owned and publicly used agricultural machinery. When conducting a mass farm tool inspection, it is best to summarize these experiences at the same time, educating the vast number of commune members to use and cherish agricultural machinery well, and to establish and improve a responsibility system for the safekeeping and use of agricultural machinery.

To do a good job in farm tool repair, fitting, and manufacturing, special attention should be paid to developing a farm machinery repair and fitting network. Many counties and communes now have farm tool factories with a rough scale, concurrently undertaking farm tool manufacturing and repair tasks. The focus of repairing and manufacturing agricultural machinery is on the agricultural machinery and small farm tools such as hoes, shovels, mattocks, and sickles needed for spring plowing and sowing, summer harvesting and planting, and autumn harvesting and sowing. Spring plowing and sowing, summer harvesting and planting, and autumn harvesting and sowing are the busiest periods of agricultural production, with the largest amount of labor used. If the agricultural machinery needed during these three periods is guaranteed, the farm tool problem will be basically solved. Small farm tools are needed at any time, so everyone should have a set, fully equipped. In some areas with more agricultural machinery, in order to ensure that more than 90% of the agricultural machinery is operating regularly, efforts should be made to have specialized factories and management organizations responsible for the repair and fitting of agricultural machinery, striving to ensure that minor repairs are done within the commune, medium repairs within the county, and major repairs within the special district. Repair factories are factories that undertake repair tasks and must not have their repair tasks squeezed out by manufacturing tasks. Materials allocated for maintenance can only be used for maintenance and cannot be used for other purposes. According to materials from the agricultural department, about 20% of the country's irrigation and drainage machinery needs to be fitted and repaired, and 20% to 30% of tractors also need to be repaired. Therefore, priority should be given to manufacturing and fitting parts for existing agricultural machinery and repairing damaged parts. Some repair factories, in order to pursue output value and the reputation of being a machinery manufacturing factory, only want to manufacture farm tools and are unwilling to repair and fit farm tools. This attitude is wrong. The more advanced agricultural machinery becomes, the more precise the required parts, and the more important the repair and fitting tasks become. Many machines cannot work without a single screw. For farm tool repair factories, is it better to manufacture one hundred parts to get one hundred old machines running, or to use the same amount of effort to manufacture one new machine? This question should be easy to answer. The repair and manufacture of general improved farm tools and small farm tools should be undertaken by the farm tool factories and repair groups of counties, communes, and production teams. Some factories that historically specialized in the production of small farm tools, once believed that small farm tools were backward and had a small output value and switched to other industries, should be quickly restored. A portion of the high-quality steel allocated for the repair and manufacture of agricultural machinery should be allocated for the manufacture and repair of small farm tools.

Repairing and fitting farm tools is a major event, and safekeeping and using them are also major events. People's communes everywhere should establish a responsibility system for safekeeping and use, based on the principle of three-level ownership with the production team as the basic unit, and based on the performance and characteristics of various farm tools. Under normal circumstances, the agricultural machinery owned by the commune, production team, and production brigade should be kept separately by each level. The agricultural machinery owned by the commune and production team can be handed over to the next level for safekeeping and use. For example, the tractors owned by the commune can be owned and managed by the commune, designated for use by the team; or they can be owned by the commune and managed by the team, for use by the production team. Some of the irrigation and drainage machinery, semi-mechanized farm tools, and improved farm tools owned by the production team can be collectively kept by the production team and fixed for use by the brigade. The medium-sized improved farm tools and large farm tools owned by the production brigade can be kept by the brigade. All agricultural machinery and large and medium-sized farm tools kept in centralized custody must be registered in the books in accordance with quantity and quality, used by designated personnel, and the responsibility assigned to specific personnel. Arbitrary transfers and misuse are absolutely not allowed. The graded, fixed use and safekeeping of production tools is an important part of implementing the policy of three-level ownership with the production team as the foundation in people's communes. Wherever this policy is seriously implemented, the enthusiasm of the production teams, production brigades, and commune members is high, the tools are well kept, and production is also good. Small farm tools are in principle self-purchased and self-used by commune members. In areas where commune members' cash income is not high, the production team can also purchase them uniformly and distribute them to commune members, deducting the price from their wages.

Agricultural machinery and tools are one of the most important means of production for people's communes. With the development of agricultural production, the commune's investment in this area is increasing; with the continuous development and innovation of agricultural technology and equipment, its impact on agricultural production is also increasing. The key to solving the problem of the safekeeping and use of agricultural machinery is to establish a responsibility system, but at the same time, political education should be carried out among the vast number of commune members as the soul of the responsibility system, educating them to love the commune like their home and to cherish agricultural machinery. While carrying out political education among commune members, technical education on the use and maintenance of agricultural machinery should be carried out, so that commune members not only cherish farm tools but also understand how to use and protect them rationally.

### 抓紧修理和制造农业机具

    抓紧修理和制造农业机具
    今年冬季，农村人民公社有一项重要任务，就是把现有的农业机械（包括拖拉机、各种动力机械、排灌机械等等）加以很好的保养、修理，使之配套齐全，同时大规模检查、修理和制造改良农具和小农具，为明年大生产作好准备。
    随着农业生产的不断发展，农业机械和农具问题越来越复杂。农具本身在变化，人和农具的关系也在变化。在小农经济时代，贫苦农民的农具是很简单的，一把锄头传三代，自有自用，自修自管。在农业生产合作社里，开始出现了集体所有的农具，包括某些改良农具，但数量是不多的。现在，人民公社和生产队里不仅有旧式农具，而且有了各式各样的改良农具和农业机械；不仅有社员自有自用的农具，而且有了越来越多的公有公用的农具。在三年大跃进中，农具添置得多，磨损的也多；有一些工作比较差的生产队，由于没有建立严格的农具使用、保管制度，有的农具散放在露天野外，受到风吹雨打的损耗。因此各地人民公社先要把现有的农业机械和农具，进行一次群众性的检查和清理，把自己的家当彻底搞清楚。一个公社、一个生产队、一个生产小队，现在拥有多少农业机具（包括机械化的和半机械化的、旧式的和新式的、公有的和私有的）？根据明年的增产计划，各个季度的劳动用工量和劳力、耕畜等情况，需要多少农具？哪些可以修理？哪些需要添置？哪些必须改革？现有多大的农具修配和制造能力？需要多少和什么样的原材料？如此等等，都要调查清楚。有些公社和生产队根据调查研究的结果，运用从上到下提方案、从下而上订规划的群众路线的方法，制订了今年冬季农具修理、制造的规划。这是一种好办法。大跃进以来，各个地区的人民公社在制造、修理、保养农业机具，特别是公有公用的农业机具方面，都积累了许多经验。在进行群众性的农具大检查的时候，最好同时把这些经验加以总结，教育广大社员很好地使用和爱护农业机具，而且建立和健全农业机具保管、使用的责任制度。
    要做好农具修配、制造工作，要特别注意搞好农业机具修配网。现在许多县和公社都有了粗具规模的农具厂，兼营农具制造、修配任务。修配、制造农业机具的重点，是春耕春播、夏收夏种、秋收秋种所需要的农业机具和镢、锨、锄、镰等小农具。春耕春播、夏收夏种、秋收秋种三个时期，是农业生产最繁忙，用工量最多的时期。这三个时期需要的农业机具有了保证，农具问题就得到了基本的解决。小农具随时要用，所以应该人手一份，配备齐全。在一部分农业机械较多的地区，为了保证90％以上的农业机械经常开动，要尽量争取做到有专厂和专管机构负责农业机械的修配，力争小修不出公社，中修不出县，大修不出专区。修配厂是负担修配任务的工厂，决不能被制造任务挤掉修理任务。分配给维修用的材料，只能用于维修，不能移作别用。根据农业部门的材料，全国排灌机械约有20％左右需要配套、修理，拖拉机有百分之二、三十也要修理。所以，应该首先抓紧为现有的农业机具制配零件，修理残缺。有些修配厂为了追求产值，为了追求机械制造厂的名声，只想制造农具，不愿意修配农具。这种态度是不对的。农业机具越进步，需要的零件越精密，修配任务越重要。许多机具，少一个螺丝钉就不能工作。对于农具修配厂来说，是制造一百个零件而使一百部旧机具转动起来好呢？还是用同样的力量去制造一部新机器好呢？这个问题应该是容易回答的。一般改良农具和小农具的修理和制造，县、公社和生产队的农具厂和修配组应该承担起来。有些生产小农具素有历史的工厂，一度认为小农具落后、产值小而改业了，应该迅速恢复起来。分配给修造农业机具用的钢材，要拨出一部分质量好的，用于小农具的制造和修理。
    修配农具是一件大事，保管、使用也是一件大事。各地人民公社要根据三级所有、队为基础的原则，根据各种农具的性能和特点，建立保管和使用的责任制度。在一般情况下，公社、生产队和生产小队所有的农业机具，由各级分别保管，公社和生产队所有的，可交下一级保管和使用。例如，公社所有的拖拉机，可以社有社管，定队使用；也可以社有队管，由生产队使用。生产队所有的一部分排灌机械、半机械化农具和改良农具，可由生产队集体保管，固定小队使用。生产小队所有的中型改良农具和大农具，可由小队保管。凡是集中保管的农业机械和大、中型农具，都要按量按质登记入账，专人使用、专人负责，决不允许随便抽调，乱拉乱用。生产工具分级固定使用和保管，是贯彻人民公社三级所有、队为基础的政策的一项重要内容。凡是认真执行这项政策的地方，生产队、生产小队和社员的积极性就高，工具就保管得好，生产也就搞得好。小农具原则上由社员自置自用。在社员现金收入不多的地方，也可由生产队统一购置，发给社员，在工资项下扣除价款。
    农业机具是人民公社最重要的生产资料之一。随着农业生产的发展，公社在这方面的投资越来越大；随着农业技术装备的不断发展和革新，它对于农业生产的影响也越来越大。解决农业机具保管和使用问题的关键是建立责任制度，但是，同时应该对广大社员进行政治教育，作为责任制度的灵魂，教育广大社员处处爱社如家，爱护农业机具。在对社员进行政治教育的同时，进行使用和保养农业机具的技术教育，使社员不只是爱护农具，而且懂得如何合理地使用和保护农具。
