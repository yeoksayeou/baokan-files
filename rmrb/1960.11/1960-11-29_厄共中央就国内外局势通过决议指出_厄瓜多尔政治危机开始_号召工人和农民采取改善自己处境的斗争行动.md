Xinhua News Agency, Quito, 26th: The Ecuadorian newspaper *El Pueblo* recently published a resolution passed by the Ecuadorian Communist Party Central Committee’s plenary session on October 26th of this year regarding the domestic and international situation.

The resolution stated that a political crisis has begun in Ecuador. The resolution pointed out that the continuous rise in the cost of living, the freezing of wages, the increase in unemployment, the authorization to obtain a loan of 120 million US dollars from abroad at high interest rates, and the obligation to purchase American goods, etc., are the reasons for the growing dissatisfaction of the masses. The resolution emphasized that the country's basic problems, such as feudalism and imperialist rule, remain untouched.

The resolution pointed out that the current government of Ecuador cannot solve the country's problems.

The resolution emphasized that the Communist Party Central Committee believes that the main task is to promote the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic united struggle. This struggle, among our people, accepts the valuable example of the Cuban revolution. The main goal of the struggle program is to carry out land reform that restricts large estates, to distribute land to peasants free of charge, and to provide rural workers with technical and financial assistance. At present, we should promote the struggle of peasants and the working class to form a close alliance, to oppose land seizures, to fight for the occupation of land, and to demand increased wages for Indians and rural laborers.

On international issues, the resolution advocates implementing an independent and peaceful international policy. The resolution also advocates: defending the Cuban revolution and opposing the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism.

In the resolution, the Central Committee pointed out that the unity of the masses is the basic condition for advancing the struggle, especially the struggle of the working class, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie for this program. The Central Committee calls for special attention to the work of uniting and organizing workers, peasants, urban poor, and students. The resolution concluded by saying that these actions will lead to the establishment of a true people's regime, a government that can meet the people's urgent aspirations, combat feudal and US imperialist oppression, and pave the way for more profound reforms.

    厄共中央就国内外局势通过决议指出
    厄瓜多尔政治危机开始
    号召工人和农民采取改善自己处境的斗争行动
    据新华社26日讯　基多消息：厄瓜多尔《人民报》最近刊载了厄瓜多尔共产党中央委员会全体会议在今年10月26日通过的关于国内和国际局势的决议。
    决议说，在厄瓜多尔，一个政治危机已经开始。决议指出，国内生活费用的不断上涨，工资的冻结，失业的增加，授权以高利在国外取得一亿二千万美元的贷款以及有义务购买美国的商品等等，是群众日益不满的原因。决议强调说，国家的基本问题像封建主义和帝国主义的统治一样，仍然没有触动。
    决议指出，厄瓜多尔目前政府不能解决国家问题。
    决议强调说，共产党中央委员会认为主要的任务是推动反帝反封建的民主统一斗争。这一斗争在我们人民中接受了古巴革命的有价值的榜样，斗争纲领的主要目的是进行限制大庄园的土地改革，把土地无偿地分给农民，给予农村工人以技术和财政援助。在目前应该推动农民与工人阶级结成紧密联盟的斗争，来反对夺佃，争取占有土地，要求增加印第安人和农村劳动者的工资。
    在国际问题方面，决议主张执行独立的和平的国际政策。决议还主张：保卫古巴革命，反对美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    中央全会在决议中指出，群众的团结是推进斗争、特别是为这个纲领而斗争的工人阶级、农民、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的斗争的基本条件。中央委员会号召特别注意团结和组织工人、农民、城市贫民和学生的工作。决议最后说，这些行动会导致建立一个真正的人民政权，这个政府能够满足人民的迫切愿望，打击封建和美帝国主义的压迫，为进行更深刻的改革开辟道路。
