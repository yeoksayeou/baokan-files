Everyone Loves the "New Agricultural Almanac"
Liu Xiaoqing, Director of Duanliu Management Area, Chengguan Commune, Qin County, Shanxi

        Having a Clear Understanding Leads to Initiative

Regarding the formulation of production plans, our management area has gradually gained some experience over the years. Things always progress from incompetence to competence, from the superficial to the profound. Before 1958, when we formulated annual production plans, it was always about how much yield per mu, how much total output, and which measures would guarantee increased production. Because the plans were simple and crude, their effectiveness was not significant when implemented.

In 1958, the Party Central Committee proposed the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture," which greatly helped us to formulate production plans in a more in-depth and detailed manner. Under the guidance of the county party committee and the commune party committee, based on the natural conditions and the characteristics of agricultural activities in our area, we formulated a "New Agricultural Almanac." This "New Agricultural Almanac" not only specifically stipulated the main links that should be grasped in each agricultural season and the focus of agricultural activities, but also, based on the systematicness and completeness of the "Eight-Character Constitution," put forward the key points that should be mastered in each character and the standard requirements that should be met.

For the past two years, thanks to adhering to the "New Agricultural Almanac," cadres and commune members have had a clear understanding, and have gained greater initiative in production.

          Finding Solutions When Facing Contradictions

New things often bring new problems. Last winter, when we were revising the "New Agricultural Almanac" and determining this year's production increase plan, the first problem we encountered was the mismatch between labor force and production tasks. Labor input in agricultural production increased by 20% compared with previous years, while the labor force decreased by sixteen people compared with the previous year. Whether this problem could be solved was directly related to the implementation of the "New Agricultural Almanac" and the completion of the production increase plan. To this end, the management committee organized cadres, experienced farmers, commune members, and technicians to conduct specific discussions. Everyone further realized the law that agricultural production has "three tight periods, three loose periods, and one idle period" in a year. "Three tight periods" are: First, the three solar terms of Grain Rain, Beginning of Summer, and Grain Full, require the completion of all autumn crop sowing tasks. Agricultural work is concentrated, and the labor input accounts for more than 30% of the total labor input for the year; Second, from Minor Heat to Major Heat, the three major agricultural tasks of summer harvest, summer planting, and field management are intertwined, the timing is the most critical, and the labor input accounts for 15% of the total labor input for the year; Third, autumn harvest, autumn planting, and autumn plowing account for about 25% or more of the total agricultural work for the year. These three periods, about one hundred and twenty days, account for 75% to 80% of the annual labor input. "Three loose periods" are: the period from after the lunar new year to before Pure Brightness, when the earth has not yet thawed and agricultural work is relatively loose; the period from Grain Full to Beginning of Summer, when the autumn seedlings are short and cannot be hoed; the period from Beginning of Autumn to End of Heat, which is the period for hanging up the hoe, and there is relatively little agricultural work. "One idle period" is the two or three months of winter. Through the above analysis, we found a way to regulate agricultural activities to solve the uneven distribution of labor throughout the year: First, based on local climatic conditions and the adaptability of crops, spring-sown crops were divided into three periods for sowing: winter sowing, early spring sowing, and spring sowing. For example, millet was changed from spring sowing to winter sowing and top-soil sowing; yams and hemp were advanced by two solar terms compared with the past; black beans and melons and vegetables were sown one solar term earlier. Second, agricultural work was arranged rationally, and efforts were made to advance the work of the busy season to the slack season. Winter was used to prepare for farming as early as possible by sending manure and preparing the land. The "three loose periods" shared the tasks of the "three tight periods." In terms of labor arrangement, planning was strengthened. Third, sudden attacks by natural disasters often cause unexpected labor shortages and bring serious difficulties to agricultural production. From summarizing the experience of the past few years, we have explored the laws and prevention methods of four major disasters: spring drought, pests and diseases, late blight of yam, and hailstorms. The method to prevent spring drought is to immediately harrow after autumn plowing, harrow the land on top of the frozen soil before thawing, and sow in time when spring plowing to make the autumn seedlings grow earlier, which ensures full and strong seedlings and avoids the occurrence period of pests and diseases. For corn and millet, the seeds should be carefully selected from the autumn harvest to ensure seed purity, which can basically prevent the occurrence of major pests and diseases such as corn smut and millet white hair. Late blight of yam can be avoided by early planting. Hail is the most harmful disaster. We have grasped that its occurrence period is mostly around Minor Heat to Major Heat every year. Therefore, when spring plowing and sowing, we must divide the planting areas of crops according to the law of hailstorm occurrence, and plant crops such as yams, sweet potatoes, and corn on the hail line. In the past two years, due to adhering to the implementation of the "New Agricultural Almanac," the reform of the cultivation system has been promoted; and the reform of the cultivation system has ensured the implementation of the "New Agricultural Almanac."

          Following Through from Beginning to End

Regarding the implementation of the "New Almanac," we pay special attention to carrying it out from beginning to end, throughout the year. Our approach is: First, grasp the publicity work of paving the way for new things, and talk about the advantages of the "New Agricultural Almanac" at length and in detail. At the same time, according to the central tasks and requirements of each agricultural activity, use short sentences to publicize through field agitation boards, street blackboards, and canteen display columns, highlighting the center of the plan, deepening people's impressions, and inspiring the consciousness and initiative of commune members. Second, use the method of disassembling baskets and matching parts to combine the long-term plan of the "New Agricultural Almanac" with the short-term arrangements of each season, month, and ten-day period, so that agricultural work, labor, and technical operating procedures are known early, so that they have both continuity and independence, and promote each other. Third, cadres clarify their division of labor and strengthen specific leadership. Full-time cadres in the management area are assigned to contract areas; management committee members take charge of "eight characters" and serve concurrently as production team leaders, holding two positions at the same time, based in one team, creating typical examples, exploring experience, and guiding the overall situation. Fourth, carry out a chain competition between teams, groups, and individuals, conduct regular evaluations, and establish good commune members and "eight-character expert" pacesetters. In the past ten months of this year, we have conducted six evaluations and have seen "August 1st Red Banner Team," "Five Old Men Advisory Group," and "March 8th Girls Team" and other pioneers in implementing the "New Agricultural Almanac." Fifth, strictly implement the inspection and acceptance system and solve problems in a timely manner.

            Revising and Supplementing Every Year

Things are developing and changing. It would be a joke to use last year's "almanac" again this year. For example, according to the requirements of the "almanac," earthwork is the key in January, but in fact, we started this work last winter, which is obviously not in line. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, we mobilized commune members to revise the "almanac" again, highlighting the fundamental measures of changing the cultivation system, regulating the busy and slack of agricultural work, and striving for initiative in everything, and proactively solving many new contradictions.

Experience has proved that the process of implementing the "New Agricultural Almanac" is also a process of improving understanding and enriching and supplementing the "almanac." In the past two years, while comprehensively implementing the Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture, we have also paid attention to grasping time and grasping stubble rotation. According to our experience, grasping the sowing time and selecting a good stubble rotation have a great effect on ensuring increased grain production. Gaining time means grain. The yield often differs by about half between early sowing and delayed sowing. Selecting a good stubble rotation is a cost-free and profitable measure to increase production. According to our experience, arranging the stubble rotation in this way has a significant effect on increasing production: sorghum stubble planted with beans, bean stubble planted with millet, millet stubble planted with corn, corn stubble planted with potatoes, potato stubble followed by wheat; avoid buckwheat stubble planted with millet and potatoes, and millet replanted in the same field. Based on the above situation, our plan for the distribution of grain crops next year is "three-three system," that is, wheat fields and millet account for one-third, corn, sorghum, and potatoes account for one-third, and the remaining one-third is miscellaneous fields.

"After the leap month year, start planting in the field while riding a horse." Next spring will come earlier than in previous years. How should agricultural production be arranged? This is a question worth studying. Based on our experience in the past two years, agricultural work is generally better to be early than late, so we must take the early word as the key and prepare for production a few steps ahead of time. To this end, we plan that in 1961, in addition to various technical measures and specific requirements, the overall revision opinion is: production preparation spans seasons, and plowing, planting, and processing span solar terms. This requires pushing the central task of each month on the original "almanac" table forward by one season, pushing the agricultural activities of each season of the year forward by one solar term, and completing as much as possible in advance.

    人人喜爱“农事新皇历”
    山西沁县城关公社段柳管理区主任　刘效清
        心中有数真主动
    对制订生产计划，我们管理区几年来逐渐摸出了一些经验。事情总是从不会到会、由浅入深一步步学来的。1958年以前，我们每年订生产计划，总是亩产多少，总产多少，保证实现增产有那几条措施等等。因为计划简单、粗糙，执行起来，作用就不怎么大。
    1958年，党中央提出了“农业八字宪法”，这对我们进一步深入细致地订生产计划有很大作用。在县委和公社党委的指示下，根据我区自然条件和农事活动的特点，制订出一个“农事新皇历”。这个“农事新皇历”，不仅具体地规定了各个农事季节应该抓取的主要环节和农事活动的中心，而且又根据“八字宪法”的系统性和完整性，提出了每个字中应该掌握的关键和应该达到的标准要求。
    两年来，由于坚持执行了“农事新皇历”，干部和社员心中有数，在生产上争得了更大的主动权。
          遇　到　矛　盾　找　办　法
    新事物往往要带来一些新问题。去年冬季我们在修订“农事新皇历”、确定今年增产计划的时候，首先碰到的问题，是劳动力和生产任务不相适应。农业生产的投工比往年增加20％，而劳动力却比上年减少十六人，能否解决这个问题，直接关系到“农事新皇历”的贯彻执行和增产计划的完成。为此，管理委员会组织干部、老农、社员和技术人员具体地作了讨论。大家进一步摸到农业生产在一年之间有“三紧、三松、一闲”的规律。“三紧”是：一、谷雨、立夏、小满三个节令，要完成全部秋作物播种任务，农活集中，需工量占全年投工的30％以上；二、小暑到大暑，夏收、夏种、田间管理三项主要农活交织在一起，时间性最强，需工量占全年投工的15％；三、秋收、秋种、秋耕，需工量约占全年农活的25％以上。这三个时期大约一百二十天，投工量就占到全年的75％到80％。“三松”是：过了阴历年到清明前的一段，大地尚未解冻，农活较松；小满到立夏刚下种完毕，秋苗矮小，不能动锄；立秋到处暑，为挂锄时期，农活也比较少。“一闲”是冬季两、三个月。通过上述分析，找到了调节农事活动，以解决全年用工忙闲不均的办法：第一，根据当地气候条件和作物的适应能力，把春播作物分为冬种、早春、春季三个时期播种。如种谷子，由春种改为冬种、顶凌种；山药、大麻比以往提前两个节令；黑豆、瓜菜提前了一个节令播种。第二，合理安排农活，尽可能把农忙时期的活，提早在农闲时期来做。冬季就及早进行送粪、整地等备耕工作，“三松”分担了“三紧”的事。在劳动力安排上，加强了计划性。第三，自然灾害的突然袭击，往往会造成意外的劳力紧张，给农业生产带来严重困难。我们从总结几年来的经验中，摸索到春旱、病虫害、山药晚疫病、雹灾等四种主要灾害发生的规律和防止的办法。防止春旱的办法是：秋耕时紧接耙耢，解冻前顶凌耙地，春耕时抢墒下种，使秋苗提早生长，既保证苗全苗旺，又避过病虫害的发生期。对玉米、谷子，从秋季收割就要认真选种，保证种籽纯洁，就可基本上防止玉茭的乌霉、谷子的白发等主要病虫害的发生。山药晚疫病只要提前早种就可以避免。雹灾是一种危害性最大的灾害，我们掌握了它的发生期多半是在每年的小暑到大暑前后。因此，在春耕播种时，就要根据雹灾发生的规律，划分农作物种植区，在雹打线上播种山药、红薯、玉茭等作物。两年来，由于坚持贯彻执行了“农事新皇历”，促进了耕作制度的改革；而耕作制度的改革，又保证了“农事新皇历”的贯彻执行。
          善始善终抓到底
    对“新皇历”的执行，我们特别注意从头到尾，全年贯彻到底。我们的做法是：第一，抓住为新事物鸣锣开道的宣传工作，大讲、特讲
  “农事新皇历”的优越性。同时根据每段农事活动的中心和任务要求，用简短的字句，通过田间鼓动牌、街头黑板、食堂揭示栏等进行宣传，突出计划中心，加深人们印象，启发社员群众的自觉性和主动性。第二，用拆筐子、配零件的办法，把“农事新皇历”的长计划与逐季、逐月、逐旬的短安排结合起来，做到农活、劳力、技术操作规程早知道，使之既有连贯性又有独立性，相互促进。第三，干部明确分工，加强具体领导。管理区专职干部分工包片；管理委员以“八字”分业挂帅，直接担任生产队长，一身兼二任，立足一个队，创造典型，摸索经验，指导全面。第四，开展队、组、人连环赛，定期评比，树立好社员和“八字通”标兵。今年十个月中，我们就评比了六次，出现了“八一红旗队”、“五老顾问小组”、“三八姑娘队”等执行“农事新皇历”的尖兵。第五，严格检查验收制度，发现问题及时解决。
            年年修改作补充
    事物是发展变化的，去年的“皇历”今年再用就会闹出笑话。比如，按“皇历”要求是一月土为纲，而实际上我们是去年冬季就开始了这一工作，显然不相适应。于是，在今年年初，我们又发动社员重新修订了
  “皇历”，突出地抓住了改变耕作制度，调节农活忙闲，事事争取主动的根本措施，主动地解决了许多新的矛盾。
    经验证明，贯彻执行“农事新皇历”的过程，也是提高认识、充实和补充“皇历”的过程。两年来，我们在全面贯彻执行农业八字宪法的同时，又注意了抓时间和抓茬口。根据我们的体会，卡住播种时间和选好茬口，对保证粮食增产作用很大。争得时间就是粮食，提前早种和失时晚种，产量往往相差一半左右。选好茬口是一项无本有利的增产措施，根据我们的经验，这样安排茬口，增产效果很显著：高粱茬种豆子，豆茬种谷，谷茬种玉米，玉米茬种薯类，薯类赶茬种小麦；切忌荞麦茬种谷和薯类以及谷子重茬。根据上述情况，我们计划明年粮食作物的分布是“三三制”，即麦田、谷子共占三分之一，玉米、高粱、薯类占三分之一，其余三分之一为杂田。
      “过了闰月年，走马就种田”。明年的春天要比往年来得早，农业生产怎么安排呢？这是一个值得研究的问题。根据我们两年来的经验，农活一般是宜早不宜迟，所以必须以早字为纲，提前几步作好生产准备。为此，我们计划在1961年除去各项技术措施和具体要求外，总的修改意见是：生产准备跨季度，耕、种、加工跨节令。这就要将原来“皇历”表上的每月中心任务，往前推一个季度，将全年各季的农事活动，往前推一个节令，能提前完成的尽量赶前。
