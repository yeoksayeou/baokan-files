    Speaking until hoarse
        Shaking hands until swollen and sore

    Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy and Republican presidential candidate Nixon, in order to climb onto the throne of the White House, have been exhausted, dazed, and have displayed ugly behavior in the fervent campaign of the past three months.

    According to an Associated Press report on November 6, Nixon had been "catching colds again and again" during the campaign and had even "injured his knee." Kennedy damaged his throat from shouting too much and was "completely voiceless" in the early stages of the campaign, and later "could only speak stutteringly" on many occasions.

    According to the U.S. "Saturday Evening Post" on October 29, Kennedy often slept only two to four hours a day. To deceive voters, he shook hands with thousands of people every day, causing blisters on his hands and spraining his fingers.

    The British "Daily Express" reported on November 7 that, due to "extreme fatigue," Nixon was unable to control himself during a televised campaign speech to the nation on the evening of November 5, resulting in confused speech and calling his vice presidential candidate, former U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Henry Cabot Lodge, by the accurate name of "Henry Cabot 'Liar'."

    Campaigning Spends Money Like Water
        Bosses Subsidize Voluntarily

    Both the Democratic and Republican parties spent an unprecedented amount of money in this year's election. In the words of an American news agency, they spent so much money that "it seems money is worthless." Nixon spent $600,000 just to deliver a television speech on November 7. American news agencies estimate that the total cost of this year's election for both parties will far exceed the $150 million in 1956, becoming the most expensive election in American history for both parties.

    Where does this money come from? An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on November 5 provided some clues. The dispatch said that although the two parties have never fully disclosed their expenditures and their sources, a Senate election subcommittee said in a report that both parties received "huge donations from many people and wealthy figures related to large enterprises and large assets." Those who are now donating money to Nixon's campaign include "many wealthy families," including "the Mellons of Pittsburgh, the Fords of Detroit, the Pews of Philadelphia, top executives of U.S. Steel and Republic Steel, and the Harrimans of Wall Street..." The dispatch did not specifically mention the names of those who donated money to the Democratic Party. However, American newspapers have long reported that Kennedy is also similarly supported by Wall Street financiers who hedge their bets on both sides, as well as large oil merchants and farmers in the American South.

    Vote-getting Tricks are Different
        Threatening to Go Crazy if They Lose

    In addition to voting for the president on November 8, many congressmen, local councilors, and governors will also be elected. Politicians of all sizes in both parties are doing everything possible to win votes. According to an Associated Press report on November 8, in Wyoming, a state legislator candidate named Melton even used this campaign strategy: he distributed a large number of campaign cards with the words: "You must vote for me. Otherwise, I will go crazy if I lose." Another candidate, a funeral home businessman named Davis, said when asking voters to vote for him that he was "the last person to let you lie peacefully (in death)."

### 美国大选丑闻多

    美国大选丑闻多
      演说喊破喉咙
          握手握得肿痛
    民主党总统候选人肯尼迪和共和党总统候选人尼克松为了爬上白宫的宝座，在三个多月以来的狂热竞选中忙得精疲力竭，神魂恍惚，丑态百出。
    据美联社6日报道，尼克松在竞选中一直“一次又一次地患感冒”，并且曾经“跌伤膝盖”。肯尼迪由于叫喊太多弄坏了喉咙，在竞选初期曾经“完全失声”，后来也“多次只能结结巴巴地讲话”。
    据美国“星期六晚邮报”10月29日透露，肯尼迪经常一天只睡二至四小时。为了欺骗选民，他每天同人握手几千次，以致手上起了泡并扭伤了手指。
    英国“每日快报”7日报道，由于“极度疲劳”，尼克松5日晚上在对美国全国发表竞选电视演说时已无法控制自己，以致言语错乱，把他的副总统候选人、美国前驻联合国常任代表亨利·卡伯特·洛奇的名字名副其实地叫做“亨利·卡伯特·说谎者”。
      竞选挥金如土
          自有老板贴补
    民主和共和两党今年在竞选中都花了空前多的钱。用美国通讯社的话说，他们花钱之多，“似乎钱是不值钱似的”。尼克松在7日单单为了发表一次电视谈话，就花了六十万美元。美国通讯社估计，两党今年竞选的费用合计将大大超过1956年的一亿五千万美元，成为美国历史上两党竞选费用最多的一次。
    这些钱来自何处？美联社5日从华盛顿发出的一条消息中作了一些透露。消息说，虽然两党从来没有把它们的开支及其来源全部公开，但是参议院选举小组委员会在一个报告中说，两党都收到“许多同大企业和大资产有关的人和富有的人物的巨额捐款”。现在捐钱给尼克松竞选的就有“许多豪富家族”其中包括“匹兹堡的梅隆、底特律的福特、费城的潘（家族）、美国钢铁公司和共和钢铁公司的最高级人员和华尔街的哈里曼……”。这条消息没有具体提到捐钱给民主党的人的名字。但美国报刊早就报道，肯尼迪也同样受到两面压宝的华尔街财阀以及美国南部的大石油商和农场主的资助。
    拉票妙法各有不同
      扬言失败就要发疯
    在8日除了投票选举总统外，还要选举许多国会议员和地方议员、州长等。两党大小政客为了拉选票，正无所不用其极。据美联社8日报道，在怀俄明州，一个名叫梅耳顿的州议员候选人竟使用了这样的竞选策略：他大量散发竞选卡片，上面写着：“你要选我。不然我失败就要发疯”。另一个候选人、殡仪馆商人戴维斯在要求选民投他一票时竟说，他是“让你（死时）安躺的最后一个人”。
