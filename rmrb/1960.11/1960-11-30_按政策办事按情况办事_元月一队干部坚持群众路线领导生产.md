    Act According to Policy, Act According to Circumstances
    Yuanyue First Team Cadres Adhere to the Mass Line to Lead Production
    Gan Tianqu, Party Branch Secretary of the Yuanyue First Production Team in Wanggang People's Commune, Xishui County, Hubei Province, summarized their experience in developing the Party's mass line work style and leading agricultural production in three sentences: "Listen to the Party, act according to policy; listen to the masses, act according to circumstances; cadres take the lead and work with the commune members."
    The Yuanyue First Team's autumn and winter production is leading the entire commune. As early as late October, all 1,800 mu of late rice in the team had been harvested. The autumn planting area was much larger than last year, the sowing quality was good, and field management work was also started early. More than 300 mu of winter fallow land has been completely ridged.
    Why is the team's production so good? First, because the Party branch seriously treats the Party's various policies. During the autumn harvest and autumn planting, the Party branch organized all cadres to conscientiously study the Party's policies and reviewed and summarized the experience and lessons learned from the past in implementing policies. Study, inspect, and deliver simultaneously. Relying on the masses, the distribution of early and mid-season rice was carried out in a timely manner. Moreover, the "three guarantees" for agricultural production in 1961 were carried out by the masses as masters of their own affairs. The method was to guarantee total output based on the actual output of the production team in the previous year. Crop arrangements were made by the small teams according to local conditions. The distribution of overproduction and income from newly reclaimed wasteland resolutely implemented the "30/70 split" (30% to the production team, 70% to the small team). After the "three guarantees" were implemented, some commune members said: "With these 'three guarantees', the team has a clear idea, and we also have a clear idea, and we all have something to strive for." In order to strive for exceeding the guaranteed output, the Tenth Small Team also tried to plant more than 17 mu of trough fields in Sizi Fan, which had never been planted with summer harvest crops. The cadres deeply realized that listening to the Party and acting according to policy is the fundamental way to improve production.
    In order to lead production according to local conditions, the Party branch and the team's cadres paid special attention to soliciting the opinions of the commune members. In order to find the direction for increasing production, production team leader Chen Shaoyuan and Party branch deputy secretary Cheng Bosheng went to the Second Small Team and the Seventh Small Team respectively to summarize the successful experiences and failures of increasing and decreasing production in this year's summer harvest. This year, the Seventh Small Team's 48 mu of wheat had a yield of only 120 jin per mu, which was 50 jin lower than the team's average yield. What's the reason? The masses found several loopholes: 1. They didn't seize the season and didn't sow until ten days after the Beginning of Winter; 2. Insufficient base fertilizer; 3. Only one plowing and one harrowing; 4. Cultivation and management did not keep up, and no topdressing was done over the winter. The Second Small Team's 50.04 mu of wheat had a yield of 197.5 jin per mu, which was 27.5 jin higher than the team's average yield. What's the experience? Just the opposite of the Seventh Small Team. They seized the season and finished planting six days before the Beginning of Winter; the base fertilizer was sufficient, and all of it was two plowing and two harrowings; the cultivation and management were good, and they weeded twice and topdressed twice over the winter. The cadres took the comparative materials of these two small teams to the masses for discussion. The commune members, combined with the specific conditions of their own small teams, summarized the experiences and lessons learned from 84 high-yield fields and 93 low-yield fields, and determined that the examples of the Second Small Team and the Seventh Small Team were universal, saying that they "caught a positive topic." Commune member Xiong Guohe said: "In the past, the techniques explained by the cadres could not be understood. This time, the homegrown experience is very enlightening and easy to learn." The cadres said: "It is good to go to the masses to summarize experience and then hand the experience over to the masses."
    Improving production is the urgent requirement of the masses, and the masses require to share the burden with the cadres. How to share it? The key is that the cadres truly believe in the masses and are good at relying on the masses. This year, during the autumn planting, due to the expansion of reclamation area, there was a shortage of some seeds and fertilizers, 31 harrows and 56 plows. What to do? Put the problem to the masses, and the commune members said: "As long as the production team can solve the seeds and tools, we will take care of the fertilizer problem." According to the opinions of the masses, the Party branch studied the matter and, led by deputy secretary of the branch Cheng Bosheng, carried rice to other places and exchanged it for some seeds, but it was not enough. The commune members said: "The cadres have put in the effort, now it's up to us." Everyone exchanged some wheat and barley from their personal savings for seeds, and the problem was successfully solved. By sharing the burden together, the cadres said: "The more we carry, the lighter it becomes"; the commune members said: "The more we carry, the more energetic we become."
    In the process of going deep into the masses, summarizing and promoting the production experience of the masses, and solving the key problems in production one by one, the cadres of the Yuanyue First Team always insisted on eating, living, working, discussing, and experimenting with the commune members. They took the lead in doing practical work and did not talk empty words. Because the cadres took the lead, they truly understood production, saw the problems accurately, and were therefore able to make decisions decisively; because they took the lead, they could promptly discover advanced examples and promote good experiences, so that the production of the entire team could develop rapidly and comprehensively. ·Hou Dangui, Secretary of the CPC Xishui County Committee of Hubei Province·

### 按政策办事按情况办事  元月一队干部坚持群众路线领导生产

    按政策办事按情况办事
    元月一队干部坚持群众路线领导生产
    湖北省浠水县汪岗人民公社元月第一生产队党支部书记甘天渠用三句话概括了他们发扬党的群众路线的工作作风，领导农业生产的经验：“听党的话，按政策办事；听群众的话，按情况办事；干部带头干和社员共同办事。”
    元月一队的秋冬生产在全社一马当先。早在10月下旬，全队一千八百多亩晚稻已收割完毕。秋种面积比去年扩大很多，播种质量好，田间管理工作也抓得早。冬闲田三百多亩已经全部起坂。
    这个队的生产为什么搞得这样好呢？首先是因为党支部严肃对待党的各项政策。在秋收秋种中，党支部组织全体干部认真学习了党的政策，并检查总结了过去执行政策的经验教训。边学习，边检查，边兑现。依靠群众，及时进行了早、中稻的分配工作。并且，由群众当家作主，进行了1961年农业生产的“三包”工作，办法是以生产队上一年的实际产量为基础包总产，作物安排由小队因地制宜进行，超产部分和新开荒地收入分配坚决实行“三七开”（上交生产队三成，小队得七成）。“三包”落实以后，有的社员说：“这样‘三包’，队里胸中有数，我们也胸中有数，都有奔头。”十小队为了争取超包产，将寺子畈一向没有种过夏收作物的十七亩多槽子田也设法改种了。干部们深深体会到：听党的话，按政策办事，是搞好生产的根本一条。
    党支部和队的干部，为了因地制宜的领导生产，特别注意征求社员的意见。为了找出增产方向，生产队长陈少元和党支部副书记程伯生，分别到二小队和七小队，总结今年夏收增产和减产的成功经验与失败教训。七小队今年四十八亩小麦，单产只有一百二十斤，比全队平均产量低五十斤。什么原因？群众找出了几个漏洞：一、没有抓住季节，到立冬后十天才播种；二、底肥不足；三、只有一犁一耙；四、培育管理没有跟上，隔冬没有追肥。二小队五十亩零四分小麦，单产一百九十七斤半，比全队平均产量高二十七斤半。什么经验？恰恰与七小队相反。他们抢住了季节，在立冬前六天就种完了；底肥足，全部是两犁两耙；培育管理好，隔冬锄了两次草，追了两遍肥。干部把这两个小队对比的材料，拿到群众中去讨论，社员又结合本小队的具体情况，总结出八十四丘高产田和九十三丘低产田的经验教训，认定二小队和七小队的事例有普遍性，说是“捉住了一个正题”。社员熊国和说：“往回干部讲的技术，懂不了。这回土生土长的经验，很开脑筋，好学习。”干部说：“到群众中去总结经验，又把经验交给群众，就是好。”
    搞好生产是群众的迫切要求，群众要求和干部共同挑担子。怎样挑法呢？关键在于干部真正相信群众，善于依靠群众。今年秋种的时候，由于开荒扩大面积，缺一部分种子、肥料，少三十一把耙和五十六部犁。怎么办？把问题提给群众，社员们说：“只要种子、工具生产队能解决，肥料问题我们包下来。”根据群众的意见，党支部作了研究，以支部副书记程伯生为首，挑着稻谷，到外地换回了一部分种子，但是还不够。社员说：“干部出了力，现在该靠我们了。”大家就把私人节余的一些小麦和大麦换出来做种，问题顺利地解决了。这样共同挑担子，干部说：“越挑越轻快”；社员说：“越挑劲头越大。”
    元月一队的干部，在深入群众，总结并推广群众的生产经验中，在一个个地解决生产上的关键问题中，总是坚持和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量、同试验。他们遇事带头实干，不说空话。干部由于带头干，就真正的了解了生产，看得准问题，因而能够多谋善断；由于带头干，就能及时发现先进，推广好经验，使全队的生产迅速全面地向前发展。	·中共湖北浠水县委书记  侯丹桂·
