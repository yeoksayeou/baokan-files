    Deeply Investigate Actual Needs in Rural Areas
    Start Early to Repair and Manufacture Winter and Spring Farm Tools
    Yangzhou Special District Industrial Departments Ascertain the Situation, Planning and Acting Simultaneously
    (Our dispatch) The industrial departments of Yangzhou Special District in Jiangsu Province, based on the results of recent investigations and research in rural areas, have formulated a plan to support agricultural technical transformation this winter and next spring. Currently, workers in machinery and farm tool factories throughout the district are launching a mass campaign to repair, assemble, and manufacture various farm tools according to the plan.
    Before the autumn harvest this year, in order to support agricultural technical transformation more effectively, the industrial departments of Yangzhou Special District organized an investigation team of more than 1,000 people, including leading cadres and workers. They adopted the method of combining labor, inspection, summarization, and planning. They went deep into people's communes and production teams in different areas such as mountainous regions, paddy fields, miscellaneous grains, and along the river. Focusing on increasing grain production and saving labor, they investigated and studied the natural conditions of various regions, the key to increasing production, crop layout, the varieties, specifications, and quantities of existing agricultural machinery, the varieties, specifications, and quantities of needed farm tools, the masses' habits of using farm tools and their opinions on farm tools, the trial production and promotion of new farm tools, the storage conditions of various farm tools, the economic conditions of communes, brigades, and commune members, and the arrangements for raw materials, quality, and cost in the production of agricultural machinery. Through investigation, they grasped a practical basis for formulating plans to support agriculture. Zhao Yuwen, Deputy Director of the Industrial Department of the District Party Committee, and Zhang Peng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Yangzhou Municipal Party Committee, led the city's industrial departments and the Party secretaries, technical cadres, workers, and procurement and marketing personnel of grassroots factories to the various production teams of Huaisi, JiuXun and other communes five times. They ate, lived, and worked with the commune members, conducted surveys and interviews, and discovered that some of the new agricultural machinery and farm tools provided in the past were manufactured according to standardized drawings from other places, which were not entirely suitable for local farming characteristics and were not used efficiently. Therefore, they immediately researched and organized the trial production of farm tools and other new farm tools suitable for the mountainous areas of Yang (zhou) and Yi (zheng) that can both cultivate land, thresh, transport, and sow seeds.
    Based on the information obtained from the in-depth investigation, the industrial departments of Yangzhou Special District have determined the "three main" principles for the production of agricultural machinery this winter and next spring: repair and assembly are the main focus, manufacturing is mainly small and medium-sized, and farm tool reform focuses on solving tools that require a large amount of labor, high labor intensity, and tight requirements for agricultural timing.
    Through investigation, the industrial departments found that many of the large and medium-sized agricultural machines needed to be repaired to varying degrees after continuous use during the summer and autumn seasons. Therefore, the industrial departments first requested in the plan that the repair and assembly of irrigation and drainage machinery, which has the greatest impact on production and the largest repair volume, should start half a year earlier than in previous years, and the repair and assembly tasks should be completed before the Spring Festival. Each new water pump should have a set of spare parts, and every three original water pumps should have two sets of spare parts. At the same time, it is required that 1.2 million small farm tools for summer harvest and summer planting be repaired before the end of December. The winter fertilizer accumulation and field management tools were also repaired by organizing forces while conducting investigations, and repair teams were organized to go to construction sites and fields to repair tools as soon as they broke down, ensuring production needs.
    Another common situation discovered in the Yangzhou Special District's investigation was that although new farm tools have been continuously increasing in recent years, the main agricultural production in the district is still manual operation, and a large number of tools are still small and medium-sized farm tools; therefore, the industrial departments in various places decided to further expand the production of small and medium-sized farm tools, so that the small and medium-sized farm tools needed for next year's summer harvest and summer planting will be the most and best since the Great Leap Forward, whether in terms of quantity, quality, variety, or specifications. In order to save a lot of labor, ensure that agricultural timing is not missed, and ensure increased agricultural production, the industrial departments of the entire district determined in the plan to support agricultural technical transformation that they will further help various places to reform tools, and strive to achieve mechanized and electric irrigation for about 80% of the district's rice fields next year, and use mechanized and semi-mechanized tools for about 40% of the threshing of three wheat crops; in terms of transportation, miscellaneous grain areas should achieve one vehicle per twenty mu of land, and water network areas should have one boat per sixty mu of land. In addition, we will continue to trial-produce and promote new machines such as rice transplanters and harvesters.
    In order to make the manufacturing and promotion of agricultural machinery more in line with the characteristics of various regions and enable agricultural machinery to play a greater role, the counties and communes in this special district, based on the "three main" principles, combined with the natural conditions, crop layout, farming system, mass habits, etc. of their regions, determined the focus of farm tool production in their regions. In the farm tool production plan, the industrial departments of Jiangdu County made unified arrangements for the agricultural machinery commonly needed in various regions, and also specifically arranged the special farm tool varieties suitable for different regions, such as promoting paddy field tractors in wetland areas to solve the needs of winter plowing and spring harrowing in paddy fields; and arranging the production of various farm tools with different specifications in miscellaneous grain areas.
    More than 200 machinery and farm tool factories in the entire special district are acting while planning, and have fully launched a vigorous upsurge in supporting agricultural technical transformation in winter. According to the sequence of agricultural seasons, various places have also divided the repair, assembly, and manufacturing of farm tools this winter and next spring into two major battles. The first battle will last until the end of December, focusing on completing the repair and manufacture of fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy, and field management tools; the second battle will last until before the Spring Festival, focusing on completing the spring plowing and spring planting tools. So far, the entire district has repaired more than 350,000 various farm tools and manufactured more than 260,000 various farm tools. (Attached picture)

    深入农村调查实际需要
    提早动手修造冬春农具
    扬州专区工业部门摸清情况边规划边行动
    本报讯　江苏省扬州专区工业部门根据最近在农村进行调查研究的结果，制订了今冬明春支援农业技术改造的规划。现在，全区机械农具厂职工正根据规划开展了修配和制造各种农具的群众运动。
    在今年秋收以前，扬州专区工业部门为了更有效地支援农业技术改造，组织了包括领导干部和职工共一千多人的调查队伍，采取边劳动、边检查、边总结、边规划的方法，分别深入山区、水田、杂谷、沿江等不同地区的人民公社和生产队，以增产粮食、节约劳力为中心，调查研究了各种地区的自然条件，增产关键，作物布局，现有农业机具的品种、规格、数量，需要农具的品种、规格、数量，群众使用农具的习惯和对农具的意见，新式农具试制推广使用的情况，各种农具的保管情况，公社、大队及社员群众的经济条件，以及农业机具生产中的原材料安排、质量和成本等方面的情况。通过调查，掌握了制订支援农业规划的切实依据。地委工业部副部长赵玉文、扬州市委书记处书记张鹏，先后五次带领市的工业部门和基层工厂的党委书记、技术干部、工人以及采购供销人员，在槐泗、酒旬等公社的各个生产小队与社员群众同吃、同住、同劳动，进行调查访问，发现以往提供的新式农业机械和农具中，有一部分是按照外地定型图纸制造的，不完全适合本地耕作特点，使用效率不高。于是，便立即研究和组织试制了适合扬（州）、仪（征）山区的既能耕田、又能脱粒、运输、播种的农具和其他新式农具。
    根据深入调查所得到的情况，扬州专区工业部门已确定今冬明春农业机具生产以修配为主、制造以中小为主、农具改革以解决花费劳动量大、劳动强度高、农时要求紧迫的工具为主的“三主”方针。
    通过调查，工业部门发现，大中型农业机具经过夏、秋两季连续使用之后，有很多已需要进行不同程度的维修。因此，工业部门在规划中首先要求把对生产影响最大而维修量又最大的排灌机械的修配，比往年提早半年开始，在春节前完成修配任务，并使每台新增的抽水机有一套备件，原有抽水机每三台有两套配件，同时要求在12月底之前修配好夏收夏种小农具一百二十万件。冬季用的积肥和田间管理工具，也都在进行调查的同时组织力量进行了修理，并且组织修配组到工地、田头，随坏随修，保证生产需要。
    扬州专区在调查中发现的另一个普遍情况是，几年来新式农具虽然不断增加，但是全区农业生产目前主要的还是手工操作，大量的工具还是中小型农具；因此，各地工业部门决定进一步扩大中、小型农具的生产，以便做到明年夏收夏种所需的中小农具，无论在数量、质量、品种、规格方面都是大跃进以来最多最好的一年。为了大量节约劳力，保证不误农时，保证农业增产，全区工业部门在制订支援农业技术改造的规划中，确定要进一步帮助各地改革工具，争取明年全区水稻田有80％左右实现机电灌溉，三麦脱粒有40％左右使用机械化半机械化工具；在运输方面，杂谷地区要达到二十亩田一部车、水网地区六十亩田一条船。此外还要继续试制和推广插秧机、收割机等新式机具。
    为了使农业机具的制造推广工作更切合各个不同地区的特点，使农业机具发挥更大的作用，这个专区各县和公社，根据“三主”方针，结合本地区的自然条件、作物布局、耕作制度、群众习惯等，确定了本地区农具生产的重点。江都县工业部门在农具生产规划中，除对各类地区共同需要的农业机具作了统一安排之外，又具体安排了适合不同地区的特殊农具品种，如在沤田地区推广水田拖拉机，解决水田冬耕春耖的需要；在杂谷地区安排了各种不同规格农具的生产。
    全专区二百多个机械农具厂，边规划边行动，已全面展开了轰轰烈烈的冬季支援农业技术改造的高潮。各地还根据农时季节的先后，把今冬明春农具的修配和制造分作两大战役，第一战役到12月底，以突击完成修造积肥、水利和田间管理工具为重点；第二战役至春节前止，以突击完成春耕春种工具为重点。到目前为止，全区已整修了各种农具三十五万多件，制造了各种农具二十六万多件。（附图片）
