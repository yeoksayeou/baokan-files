Comrade, don't laugh at me, I'm not usually a sentimental person! In the old society, I'd rather bleed than cry! It's just that I'm so moved, that's why the tears are flowing! I want to say: no one is closer to us than our Party! Chairman Mao is our thoughtful and caring leader! A year like this, with such a great famine, is truly rare in a century: drought, so dry that the dust on the road is ankle-deep; flood, so flooded that boats can sail on the roads! There was also a "bad year" in the 18th year of the Republic of China, but it was much lighter than this year. Back then, when you came to the countryside, you'd hardly see a soul all day! Those who could move grabbed sticks and begged along the way, going down to Guandong; the old, weak, and disabled starved to death with no one to bury them, even the dogs' eyes turned red from eating! The wealthy families bolted their doors and reinforced them with bars! The watchdogs, with their rifles loaded, protected the landlords while they
	drank, ate meat, and fried pancakes! In the poor people's homes, the weeds in the yard grew waist-high, and in the empty cooking stove, wild rabbits made their nests... Look at it now, does any of it look like a famine year? People and horses are bustling everywhere on the mountains and plains: look! That one waving his arms, "Crack! Crack!" cracking his whip, the plowed land, like rows of black waves rolling over, guess who that is? -- A member of the county committee! Listen, that rumbling sound is from the worker brothers sending tractors, seeders, and harvesters! Look, look over there again! Large groups of people, some in green, some in blue, those are the army and navy, also going to the front line of "grain protection"! They said: They want to turn this place
	into a new Nanniwan! Look up at the mountains again! Some are carrying baskets, some are carrying loads, some are climbing high up the trees, some are holding bamboo poles, those are the students doing small autumn harvests, they've brought a militia regiment... Even those of us living in the nursing home have formed an "Old Farmer Advisory Group," going down to the fields and up the mountains to observe and give advice. As for me, I had a minor illness, and the commune Party secretary
	insisted on taking me off the "front line"! I'll have to give him my opinion when I get back! Comrade, tell me, what's my little illness, but I'm still getting three injections a day! The food is specially made by the nutrition kitchen. Take this bowl of porridge for example: the rice probably comes from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, and these red dates, I know for sure: they come from Lingbao County, Henan Province... When has there ever been such a thing, a disaster in one place, assistance from all directions! And this sugar, I heard the civil school teacher say, is a specialty of Cuba! Cuba is so brave, daring to fight the American devils! They would rather die standing than bend their waists! Like our Chinese people, they are heroes with steel bones! I heard that we buy sugar from Cuba, which is also support for the Cuban people; we can't just look at our own difficulties, the Cuban people's struggle is also a contribution to the people of the whole world; all the people of the world are one family, our Chairman Mao really sees far... Comrade! I'm old and long-winded, talking about everything under the sun, going further and further, don't you mind? Let's get back to the point, let's talk about our commune members: their hearts are higher than the sky, they want to overcome this great famine! The old man in the sky is deliberately making trouble, setting up heavy obstacles! Don't be afraid! We have the Party, we have Chairman Mao, we have 670 million people across the country! Holding high the three red banners, we will break through the barriers! Open the Southern Heavenly Gate, rush into the Palace of the Celestial Emperor, and make the old man in the sky kowtow and beg for mercy, obediently
	listening to our
	commands...

    灾区老农一席话
    符加雷同志，别见笑，我不是婆婆妈妈的人！在旧社会，我是宁流血不流泪的呀！实在是受感动，我这才热泪滚滚！我要说：谁亲，也亲不过咱们的党！毛主席是咱知寒知暖的贴心人！像今年这样的大荒年，真是百年少见：旱，旱得路上尘土脚脖深；涝，涝得马路上能撑船！民国十八年也闹过“年成”，可是远比今年轻。那会儿，你下乡来，走一天也难碰见一个人影！能动的，拉起棍子，沿途乞讨，下了关东；老弱残废，饿死没人埋，狗都吃红了眼睛！财主家上了大门，又用杠子顶！看家奴，洋枪推上顶膛火，保护财主们
    喝酒吃肉烙油饼！穷人家，院里茅草齐腰深，锅腔里，野兔铺窝掏窟窿……你看看现在，哪一点像个荒年？满山遍野，人腾马喧：瞧！那个挥起胳膊的，“叭！叭！”撒着响鞭，犁过的地，像排排黑浪滚翻，你猜那是谁？——县委委员！听，那轰??响的，是工人老大哥送来的拖拉机、播种机、收割机！看，你再朝那边看！大队人马，有的穿绿，有的穿蓝，那是陆军和海军呀，也开上了“保粮”第一线！他们说：要把这儿
        当成南泥湾！你再往山上看！有的提篮，有的挑担，有人在攀高上树，有人举着竹竿，那是学生们在搞小秋收，他们开来了一个民兵团……就连我们这些住敬老院的，也成立了个“老农顾问团”，下地上山，察看指点。我呀，有了点小病，公社党委书记
  硬把我拉下“火线”！回头，我得跟他提意见！同志，你说说看，我这点小病算个啥，还一天打三针！饮食嘛，是营养灶格外做的饭。就说这碗粥吧：大米可能是来自江苏、浙江、安
  徽、四川，这红枣，我清楚：它来自河南
  省灵宝县……哪朝哪代有过这种事呀，一处有灾，八方支援！还有这糖，我听民校教员讲，是古巴的特产！古巴国真英勇，敢跟美国鬼子干！宁愿站着死，不肯把腰弯！跟咱中国人民一样，是钢筋铁骨的英雄汉！听说咱买古巴的糖，也就是对古巴人民的支援；不能光看咱有困难，人家古巴人民的斗争，也是对全世界人民的贡献；天下人民是一家呀，咱们毛主席可真看得远……同志！我人老罗嗦，天南海北，越扯越远，你嫌不嫌烦？咱把话说回来，还是说咱们公社社员：人心比天高，要战胜这大荒年！老天爷故意捣蛋，设下了重重难关！不怕！有党，有毛主席，有全国人民六亿七千万！扛起三面大红旗，咱要斩将过关！打开南天门，冲进凌霄殿，叫老天爷磕
  头作揖，乖乖地听咱
  使唤……
