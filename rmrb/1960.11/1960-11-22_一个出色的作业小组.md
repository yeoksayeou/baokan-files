    An Outstanding Work Group
	The CCP Xiangyin County Committee of Hunan Province
	The CCP Nanhu Commune Party Committee Communication Group

    The Third Work Group of the Third Production Team of the Heping Brigade of the Nanhu Commune in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, is a model work group renowned throughout the county for its all-around success in production and daily life.

    The success of this work group is due to the strong leadership of the brigade and production team party organizations, as well as to a diligent, hardworking, and wholeheartedly service-oriented work group leader, and a red management team; it is also due to the establishment of a relatively complete set of management systems.

            Good Work Group Leader

    The work group leader, Zheng Hansheng, born into a poor peasant family, is thirty years old this year and a Communist Party member. He is a capable cadre who comprehensively manages the group's ideology, production, and daily life, and does so excellently. In various production campaigns, he always stands at the forefront, leading the masses in charge, without any fear of difficulties. In the past seven and a half months this year, he earned two thousand eight hundred and fifty work points, the most of anyone in the team.

    At the beginning of this year's double rush season, a few people were unwilling to handle the "tangled rice." Comrade Zheng Hansheng led his group to the most tangled rice fields on the upper hills, and their work efficiency even exceeded that of those working in the good fields, and the quality was also very good. Under his influence, those who were originally afraid of difficulties also volunteered to handle the "tangled rice." Initially, the efficiency of handling the rice was not high, with a quota of ten base points for handling five hundred catties of rice, but some people could not complete the quota. Seeing this situation, Comrade Zheng Hansheng went deep into the Li Menglin Youth Shock Brigade and worked hard and cleverly with the commune members. The average work efficiency per ten base points reached more than eight hundred catties, exceeding the quota by 60%. After this high-efficiency red flag was established, a high-efficiency competition movement to learn from and compete with the Li Menglin group was quickly launched throughout the group. The efficiency of handling rice increased from more than eight thousand catties per day to more than twelve thousand catties. Plowing and transplanting also followed closely. As a result, the "double rush" task was completed two days ahead of schedule.

    Comrade Zheng Hansheng is not only a good example for commune members in labor, but also loves the collective and cares about the collective. On the night of May 20th this year, Comrade Zheng Hansheng was suddenly awakened by a clap of thunder. Hearing the sound of the storm outside the window, he immediately thought that the thirty acres of early rice newly expanded and planted in the lower areas were in the peak of tillering. If they were flooded, they would suffer great losses. As soon as he thought of this, he turned over and got up, put on a straw hat, put on a raincoat, and went to various sections of the dikes in the rain to patrol. It was really dangerous! A breach had occurred in the waterlogged dike of Longjia Weizi, and a large stream of water was pouring directly into the rice fields. In the blink of an eye, he jumped down, stood in the middle of the breach, and quickly dug up soil to block it. He fought until dawn and finally sealed the breach. As a result, the early rice did not suffer any losses.

    Comrade Zheng Hansheng's life is the same as the masses, without any special treatment; he handles affairs fairly and impartially, without any favoritism. Once, during a heavy rain, he was watching the water in the fields by the lake and caught a seven-jin carp, which he handed over to the canteen for everyone to eat. Commune members said that he could sacrifice himself for the public good in matters big and small. The work group handled some small property and often had some miscellaneous income, which he clearly handed over to the work point recorder for distribution to everyone. Usually, he handled all matters related to the material interests of the commune members fairly, so that everyone was satisfied.

            Good Management Team

    In addition to a good leader, this work group also has a very complete management team. This team is composed of fair, capable, and outstanding individuals democratically elected by the masses. They are all activists from poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, with firm stances, high awareness, and proactive and responsible work, always taking the lead. They are closely united around the work group leader, forming a strong leading core. Every time Comrade Zheng Hansheng returned from a meeting at the team level, they would proactively surround him and ask, "Hansheng, what new tasks do you have? Just tell us, and we guarantee to complete them." This leading core, based on work needs and individual strengths, carried out a reasonable division of labor, ensuring that everything was managed, everyone had a specific responsibility, each performed their own duties, and each was responsible for their own tasks; it also ensured mutual cooperation, mutual collaboration, unity, and unified leadership, so that the group's ideology, production, and daily life were all grasped in an orderly manner.

    The members of this red management team and their division of labor are as follows: Work group leader Zheng Hansheng, in charge of the overall situation and ideology. Deputy work group leader Liang Xingmei, a labor expert with rich production knowledge, is responsible for agricultural production. He is honest and very serious in his work. He can complete any task outstandingly. He always takes the lead in production, and his labor work points are second only to the work group leader. Women's group leader Chen Guxiu, a member of the Communist Youth League, is the best labor hand among women. She is young and lively, and leads the women like a family. Canteen leader Li Cuizhen is responsible for both life welfare and sideline production. Since she became the canteen leader, she has always been concerned about the canteen, constantly thinking about how to run the canteen better, so that everyone can eat enough, eat well, and save money. Because of her outstanding achievements in running the canteen, she gloriously attended the county, prefectural, and provincial hero conferences. Work point recorder Zhang Rongchang did a very outstanding job in quota management. He adopted the method of "four carries" (work point book, pen, abacus, ruler) when going to work, and used field breaks to do the evaluation and scoring work, so that the work point accounts were cleared daily and settled monthly. Technician Shi Liansheng, a member of the Communist Youth League, is very determined to promote advanced technology and pays special attention to quality in production. Storekeeper Zhou Liji is an old "Huang Zhong" in his sixties. Since he took on the work of storekeeper, the agricultural tool distribution system has been strictly implemented. Agricultural tools that are not in use are washed clean and oiled to a shine.

    This management team adopts the "arrange, do, check, learn, help" five-character work method in grasping ideology and organizing production and daily life. "Arrange" is to reasonably arrange work and production. They hold a backbone meeting every five days to comprehensively arrange work once, and then go to implement it separately. At the same time, in arranging work, they also arrange one step, prepare two steps, and consider three steps, so that all work strives for the initiative. "Do" is that all cadres in the group, especially the work group leader, take the lead in doing everything in every production campaign, set an example to guide, and play the role of a locomotive. "Check" is to check the implementation of production and work, including the implementation of resolutions, work progress, and quality requirements. After each work arrangement, the work group leader spends one or two hours every morning and evening checking the whole group. They also pay attention to summarizing while checking, discovering and disseminating experience in a timely manner, and solving problems quickly to ensure the smooth progress of all work. "Learn" is to strengthen learning. Most of the cadres in this group were illiterate before liberation. Due to their hard work in learning culture, they have basically reached the cultural level of primary school and can read the documents, instructions, and party newspapers of the higher authorities. They often study documents and newspapers before the meeting. They are also good at learning from other places and learning from the masses. "Help" is that cadres always pay attention to learning from each other and making progress together. They have established a system: a life meeting is held regularly every month to carry out criticism and self-criticism. For example, labor group leader and Communist Youth League member Huang Wengu is very active in his work, but he has a bad temper and sometimes yells at the masses, which affects the relationship between cadres and the masses. After many times of assistance through the life meeting, he quickly corrected it, and now the commune members have a very good reaction to him.

    Work group leader Zheng Hansheng pays great attention to giving full play to the role of all cadres in the group, and never monopolizes or acts arbitrarily. Under his leadership, the work of the whole group is well organized and busy but not chaotic.

            Good at Uniting the Masses

    The entire group of cadres, led by work group leader Zheng Hansheng, is good at contacting the masses and following the mass line. They adopt many methods, such as holding various forums regularly to understand the demands of the masses; using the method of opening a lock with a key to carry out ideological education according to the characteristics of each person; making close friends with the masses, and so on. Each cadre has united a group of activists around them through these methods. Let these activists then lead the entire group of commune members, so that the entire group is twisted into one rope, everyone is of one mind and one heart, and they are determined to produce and build a new socialist countryside. Take Comrade Zheng Hansheng as an example, he is very good at uniting the masses and very good at doing people's work. The youth Li Menglin was once uneasy about producing in the countryside last year. Comrade Zheng Hansheng immediately made friends with him, produced with him, patiently taught him production technology, and educated him on the future of the new socialist countryside, so that Li Menglin quickly settled down and became an activist in production. Around Comrade Zheng Hansheng, there are five young men who are very close to him. They are all brave generals who are not afraid of difficulties and are full of energy. The masses call them "tigers out of the mountains." These fierce generals have played a prominent role in various production campaigns. For example, in the "double rush" battle, others disliked the deep muddy fields that were difficult to handle, but they tried their best to handle the deep muddy fields where the rice was tangled. They took the lead in creating a high work efficiency of 800 catties of grain per person per day on average, driving the entire group of commune members and setting off a high work efficiency competition movement in which you chase me.

    Women's group leader Chen Guxiu, in addition to closely contacting all the women in the group, has also trained seven young female activists. They are together in production every day, study together, sing and talk together during breaks, just like close sisters. The masses call them "eight golden flowers." Li Juxiang, one of the golden flowers, is a member of the Communist Youth League. In May, she married a young man from the Shatou Commune in Yiyang County across the river. The couple has a very good relationship, but she still insists on working in her mother's home. She said: "I can't bear to leave the group leader and all the sisters. When I see everyone, my enthusiasm for production comes."

    All the cadres in this group are even more considerate to the lives of the masses, and they regard the sufferings of the masses as their own sufferings. The relationship between cadres and the masses is as close as fish and water, as close as a family. In January this year, elderly commune member Zhou Liji suffered from "back sores" and was in so much pain that he couldn't close his eyes for days and nights. Comrade Zheng Hansheng asked the doctor to treat the old man three times in a row, and even ran twenty miles at night to invite a famous doctor. Canteen leader Li Cuizhen specially made special meals for the elderly to whet their appetite. These made the old man shed tears of emotion. After he recovered his health, he was particularly active in production work and was elected by the masses as a storekeeper.

    Cadres care so much about the masses, and the commune members also take care of the cadres very much. Once, the canteen decided to eat fish for lunch. Comrade Zheng Hansheng had to go out to a meeting and could not go home for lunch. After hearing this, the commune members unanimously proposed to the canteen leader to save the fish for Zheng Hansheng to eat together when he came back. Because canteen leader Li Cuizhen was busy in the canteen day and night, she didn't have time to wash her clothes, so the female commune members automatically helped her sew and wash them.

            Good Management System

    In terms of labor organization and responsibility system, this work group also has a set of better methods. The first is the rational arrangement of labor. The young and strong labor force focuses on field production to engage in grain, and appropriately arranges some semi-labor force to grasp life welfare and sideline production, and fixes these labor forces. Without special reasons, they are not easily changed, ensuring that the policy of taking grain as the key link in agriculture and comprehensively developing diversified operations is implemented. The second is to emphasize unified collaboration and ensure the completion of agricultural production tasks. On the premise, the labor force engaged in agriculture is organized into labor groups. The whole group is based on living conditions, the reasonable allocation of strength, and appropriate care for the requirements of the commune members themselves, and is divided into three labor groups, each group has ten to twelve labor forces, and there is a member of the Communist Youth League or an activist as the group leader. Under normal circumstances, labor is carried out in groups. When necessary, groups are allocated between groups, or the entire work group concentrates its efforts to make breakthroughs. The advantage of this organizational form is: First, it enables each backbone to better unite the commune members around them and establish a closer relationship; second, it can better carry out competitions between groups in the work group, which vigorously promotes production; third, through the reasonable allocation of technical strengths and weaknesses, young people can systematically learn agricultural production technology under the guidance of fixed old farmers. The third is that in terms of field management, the personal management responsibility system of the past, where one person manages several fields and does a good job in "three guarantees and three preventions," has been developed into a management responsibility system of dividing areas into group management. The fields of the entire work group are concentrated and connected piece by piece. According to the irrigation system, they are divided into five areas, which are handed over to the three labor groups for collective management; each group has one to two central managers who are responsible for watching the water, observing the disease and insect conditions, and the scope of responsibility is still limited to "three guarantees and three preventions." As for the progress of various agricultural tasks, it is still uniformly arranged by the work group. The advantage of doing this is: the management work will not be affected due to the lack of skill of the manager, or due to illness or other matters. Fourth, a sound evaluation and scoring system and a comparison and inspection and reward and punishment system have been established. Each agricultural task has democratically formulated quota standards, and the evaluation and scoring of work points is adhered to every day, and the quality of work is checked in combination with the evaluation of work. The whole group also regularly carries out the evaluation of "five good commune members" and "whole family red", and pays attention to commending and rewarding outstanding commune members at any time. Fifth, there is a system to protect women's labor. For example, pregnant women do not do agricultural work, women do not send heavy work or work in the water during menstruation, and women with breastfeeding babies are arranged to work near their homes to facilitate breastfeeding, and so on.

### 一个出色的作业小组

    一个出色的作业小组	中共湖南湘阴县委	中共南湖公社党委通讯组
    湖南湘阴县南湖公社和平大队第三生产队的第三作业组，是闻名全县的生产、生活满堂红的模范作业组。
    这个作业组搞得出色，除了大队、生产队党组织的坚强领导以外，还由于有一个勤勤恳恳、任劳任怨、全心全意为群众办事的作业组长，和一个红色的管家班子；也是由于建立了一套相当完善的管理制度。
            作业组长好
    贫农出身的作业组长郑汉升，今年三十岁，共产党员。他是个善于当家的干部，把全组的思想、生产、生活都全面地抓起来了，而且抓得很出色。在各项生产运动中，他都是站在最前列，领导群众冲锋陷阵，对困难毫无畏惧。今年七个半月来，他做了二千八百五十个工分，是全队做活最多的一个。
    今年抢收抢种战斗开始时，有少数人不愿扮“乱禾”，郑汉升同志就带领自己这组的人到禾倒得最乱的上山丘去扮，工效还超过了扮好田的人，质量也很好。在他的影响下，原先怕困难的人，也自动来扮“烂禾”了。开初扮禾工效不高，定额十个底分扮五百斤谷，可是有些人完不成定额。看到这种情况，郑汉升同志又深入到李梦林青年突击组，与社员一道猛干巧干，每十个底分平均工效达到八百多斤，超过定额60％。这面高工效红旗树立以后，全组迅速掀起了一个学李梦林组、赛李梦林组的高工效竞赛运动，扮禾工效由原来日扮八千多斤提高到一万二千多斤。整田的、插秧的，也随着紧紧地追赶上来。结果“双抢”任务提前两天完成。
    郑汉升同志不仅在劳动上是社员的好榜样，而且热爱集体、关心集体。今年5月20日的夜里，郑汉升同志忽然被一阵炸雷惊醒，听到窗外的暴风雨声，他马上想到新扩种在较低处的三十亩早稻正处在发蔸盛期，如果被水淹了，就会受大损失。一想到这里，便翻身起床，戴起斗笠，穿上蓑衣，冒雨到各处堤段去进行巡查。真险呀！龙家围子的渍水堤溃了一条口，一股大水直往稻田里灌。说时迟那时快，他一纵身跳了下去，站在溃口中间，连忙挖土堵塞，一直战斗到天明，到底把溃口塞好了，结果早稻没有遭受损失。
    郑汉升同志在生活上和群众一个样，没有半点特殊；办事公公道道，从无偏袒。有次落大雨，他在湖边田里看水，捉了一条七斤重的鲤鱼，交给食堂让大家吃，社员说他大小事情都能舍己为公。作业组搞了些小家当，经常有点零碎收入，他都清清楚楚交给记工员分配给大家，平时凡是关系社员物质利益的事情，他都公正处理，使大家满意。
            管家班子好
    这个作业组除了有一个好组长以外，还有一个很齐整的当家班子。这个班子都是群众民主选举出来的公道、能干的优秀人物，都是贫农、新、老下中农中的积极分子，立场稳，觉悟高，工作积极负责，事事带头干。他们紧紧地团结在作业组长的周围，形成了一个坚强的领导核心。郑汉升同志每次从队上开会回来，不等召集会议，他们就主动地围上来问：“汉升，有什么新任务吗？只顾讲来，我们保证完成。”这个领导核心根据工作需要和各人的特长，进行了合理分工，既做到了事事有人管，人人有专责，各司其事，各负其责；又做到了互相配合，互相协作，团结一致，统一领导，把全组的思想、生产、生活都有条有理地抓了起来。
    这个红色的当家班子的成员和他们的分工情况如下：作业组长郑汉升，抓全面，抓思想。副作业组长梁杏枚，是个生产知识丰富的劳动能手，负责抓农业生产。他为人忠厚，做起工夫来十分认真，不论什么任务，都能出色地完成，生产上处处带头，得的劳动工分仅次于作业组长。妇女组长陈谷秀，共青团员，是妇女中第一把劳动好手，她年轻活泼，把妇女们领导得像一家人似的。炊事组长李翠珍，负责生活福利和副业生产两项工作。她当了炊事组长后，处处为食堂着想，时刻在盘算如何把食堂办得更好，让大家吃得饱吃得好吃得省。由于她在办食堂中创造了出色的成绩，光荣地出席了县、专区、省三级群英大会。记工员张荣昌把定额管理工作抓得十分出色，他采取出工四带（记工簿、钢笔、算盘、尺）的办法，利用田间休息做好评工记分工作，使工分账目做到了日清月结。技术员石连生，共青团员，对推广先进技术非常坚决，在生产中特别重视质量。保管员周利吉，是个六十多岁的老“黄忠”，在他担任保管工作以来，农具领发制度执行得很严格。暂时不用的农具，都洗得干干净净，油得闪光发亮。
    这个当家班子在抓思想和组织生产、生活中，采取“排、干、查、学、帮”的五字工作方法。“排”是合理安排工作和生产。他们每五天召开一次骨干会议，全面安排一次工作，然后分头去执行。同时，在安排工作上，还做到了安排一步，准备二步，考虑三步，使各项工作都争取了主动。“干”是全组干部，特别是作业组长，在每项生产运动中，都带头干，做出个样子，来进行指导，起到火车头的作用。“查”是检查生产和工作的执行情况，包括执行决议、工作进度、质量要求等内容。在每段工作安排以后，作业组长每天都要在早晚抽出一、二个钟头，到全组进行检查。并注意边检查边总结，发现经验及时传播，发现问题迅速解决，保证各项工作的顺利进行。“学”是加强学习，这个组的大部分干部，在解放前是文盲，由于努力学文化，基本上都达到了小学文化程度，能阅读上级的公文、指示和党报，他们经常在开会之前，学习文件和报纸，同时还善于向外地学，向群众学。“帮”是干部中随时注意互相学习，共同进步，他们建立了一项制度：固定每月召开一次生活会议，开展批评与自我批评。如劳动小组长、共青团员黄文谷，工作非常积极，可是脾气大，有时候在群众中大喊大叫，影响了干群关系。通过生活会议多次帮助后，很快就改正了，现在社员们对他的反映很好。
    作业组长郑汉升同志，很注意发挥全组干部的作用，从不包办代替，独断独行。在他的领导下，全组工作井井有条，忙而不乱。
            团结群众好
    以作业组长郑汉升同志为首的全组干部、都善于联系群众、走群众路线。他们采取的方式很多，如定期召开各种座谈会。了解群众的要求；用一把钥匙开一把锁的方法，针对每个人的特点进行思想教育；与群众交知心朋友，等等。每个干部都通过这些方法，在自己周围团结了一批积极分子。让这些积极分子再带动全组社员，使全组拧成了一股绳，大家一条心，一股劲地发愤生产，建设社会主义的新农村。拿郑汉升同志来说吧，他就很善于团结群众，很善于作人的工作。青年李梦林，去年曾一度不安心在农村生产。郑汉升同志立即找他交了朋友，和他在一块儿生产，耐心教给他生产技术，对他进行社会主义新农村的前途教育，使李梦林很快安下心来了，还成了生产中的积极分子。在郑汉升同志的周围，有五个与他十分要好的青年小伙子，他们都是不怕困难、干劲冲天的猛将，群众称之为“出山虎”。这些猛将们，在各项生产运动中，起了突出作用。比如在“双抢”战斗中，别人嫌烂泥深的田难扮，他们却尽挑烂泥深的、禾倒乱了的田去扮。首创每人平均日扮谷八百斤的高工效，带动了全组社员，掀起了你追我赶的高工效竞赛运动。
    妇女组长陈谷秀，除了紧密地联系了全组的妇女外，还培养了七个女青年积极分子，每天生产在一起，学习在一起，休息时一块儿唱歌谈心，像亲姊妹一样，群众称之为“八朵金花”。金花之一的李菊香，是个共青团员，5月份与对河的益阳县沙头公社一个青年结了婚，夫妻感情很好，可是她却仍然坚持要在娘家劳动。她说：“我舍不得离开组长和全体姐妹们，一见到大家，我的生产劲头就来了。”
    这个组的全体干部，对群众的生活更是体贴得无微不至，他们把群众的疾苦当作自己的疾苦。干群之间，鱼水相依，亲如一家。今年1月，老年社员周利吉生了“背花疮”，痛得几天几夜未合眼。郑汉升同志一连三次请医生给老人医治，还连夜跑到二十里路外请来名医。炊事组长李翠珍，专门为老人做开胃口的特餐。这些，使老人感动得流下眼泪。他恢复健康后，生产工作特别积极，被群众选为保管员。
    干部如此关心群众，社员也非常爱护干部。一次，食堂里决定中餐吃鱼，郑汉升同志要外出开会，不能回家吃午饭。社员们听说后，一致向炊事组长提议，把鱼留到郑汉升回来一同吃。炊事组长李翠珍由于日夜在食堂里忙碌，没时间洗衣服，女社员们就自动帮她缝洗。
            管理制度好
    在劳动组合和责任制度方面，这个作业组也有一套较好的方法。第一是劳力合理安排，青壮劳力主攻田间生产搞粮食，适当安排一些半劳力抓生活福利和副业生产，并把这些劳力固定下来，没有特殊原因不轻易变动，保证农业以粮为纲、全面发展多种经营的方针贯彻执行。第二是在强调统一协作，保证完成农业生产任务的前提下，把搞农业的劳力组成劳动小组。全组根据居住条件、力量的合理搭配和适当照顾社员本人的要求，组成三个劳动小组，每组有十至十二个劳力，有一个团员或积极分子当小组长。在一般情况下，以组为单位劳动，必要时组与组之间进行调配，或者全作业组集中力量突击。这种组织形式的好处是：一、使每个骨干能更好地团结自己周围的社员，建立更亲密的关系；二、能更好地在作业组内开展小组与小组之间的竞赛，有力地推动生产；三、通过技术强弱的合理搭配，能使青年人在固定的老农指导下，系统地学习农业生产技术。第三是在田间管理方面，把过去一人管理数丘田，做好“三保三防”工作的个人管理责任制，发展成为划片分组管理的管理责任制。全作业组的田亩一垅垅的，集中连片，根据灌溉系统，划分成五个片，交给三个劳动小组集体管理；每组又有一至二个中心管理员，负责看水、观察病虫情况，责任范围仍只限于“三保三防”，至于各项农活的进行，仍然由作业组统一安排。这样作的好处是：不会因管理人技术不熟练、或者因病因事而影响管理工作。第四是建立了健全的评工记分制度和评比检查、奖惩制度。每项农活都有民主制订的定额标准，每天都坚持评工记分，并结合评工检查工夫质量。全组还经常开展“五好社员”和“全家红”的评比，随时注意表扬和奖励优秀社员。第五是有一个保护妇女劳力的制度。如孕妇不出农业工、妇女月经期不派重活和下水的活，有吃奶婴孩的妇女安排在家门附近干活，便于喂奶，等等。
