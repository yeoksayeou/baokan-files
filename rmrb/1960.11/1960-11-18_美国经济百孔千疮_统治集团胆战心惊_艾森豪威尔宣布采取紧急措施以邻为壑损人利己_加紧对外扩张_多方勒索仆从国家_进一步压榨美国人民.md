Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower, terrified by the recent sharp deterioration in the U.S. international balance of payments situation and the rapid outflow of gold, issued a directive yesterday announcing a series of emergency measures in an attempt to slightly patch up some of the holes in the international balance of payments.

In his directive and at the press conference he personally presided over yesterday, Eisenhower blatantly put pressure on U.S. allies, demanding that they sacrifice their interests in many areas such as trade and military spending to help rescue the broken U.S. economy, a ship riddled with holes and sinking.

The emergency measures announced by Eisenhower are wide-ranging, some of which the U.S. ruling group came up with after racking their brains. However, in order to maintain U.S. military and economic expansion overseas, he neither retreats from nor reduces the U.S. military presence in foreign countries, nor does he stop or restrict monopoly capital investment overseas, thus allowing the two main roots of the deterioration of the U.S. international balance of payments to continue to exist. He emphasized in his directive that the U.S. "will not cut" its military strength, and "will not harm" its "international economic programs."

Eisenhower's directive exclaimed that Western European countries and Japan, "countries that were once devastated by war, are now fully capable of competing with the United States in the free world market (referring to the capitalist world market)," and that the U.S. military support for its "allies" "has also caused dollars to flow abroad, mainly due to maintaining our troops stationed in foreign countries." He then pointed out that the U.S. foreign economic "aid" also leads to the outflow of dollars.

He went on to say, "Due to the above and other factors, the United States has been facing a persistent deficit in its international balance of payments," "The resulting deficit is settled by a large outflow of gold and an increase in our dollar debt. A large part of our deficit has been settled with gold, and as a result, the Treasury's gold reserves have decreased by approximately $4.5 billion (Editor's note: actually $4.7 billion) since the end of 1957."

The U.S. President admitted in a frustrated tone that despite the various measures he has taken at home and abroad in recent years in an attempt to "help improve the balance of payments and maintain confidence in the dollar," he has been unable to reverse the downward trend. He mentioned the financial and fiscal measures taken domestically, forcing U.S. allies to eliminate trade "barriers" to U.S. imports, initiating the establishment of the International Development Association to enable other countries to share the U.S. foreign "aid" expenses, stipulating that countries borrowing from the U.S. Development Loan Fund must use the loans to buy U.S. goods, and providing U.S. exporters with loans and guarantees, etc. Eisenhower said that if these measures had not been taken, "our payment problems would be even more serious today." But he lamented that despite all the efforts, and despite the fact that the U.S. foreign trade situation this year is better than in 1959 and may achieve a surplus of approximately $6.5 billion, the U.S. payment deficit "is currently at an annual rate of more than $3 billion, and will develop to be not far from the nearly $4 billion in 1959 (Editor's note: actually the annual rate of the deficit in the third quarter of this year reached $4.3 billion)." Eisenhower said that this year there has been a "huge short-term capital outflow movement," "The large amount of this capital flow recently and the large amount of gold purchases by foreign monetary authorities in the past four months make it necessary for us to intensify our efforts to further improve our payment situation." Eisenhower shouted at his allies, saying that "improving" the U.S. international payment situation "is also to ensure that the United States continues to be a strong fortress for the economic development and military strength of the free world in the future." At the same time, he admitted, "Due to the competitive conditions we face in the world, it is difficult to expand our cash income from exports alone, and we must include some aspects of reducing government foreign dollar expenditures in our efforts."

Eisenhower announced a series of measures to attack U.S. allies, countries that borrow money from the U.S., and the U.S. working class, including:

	"Continue to urgently demand that other countries, especially those that are economically and financially strong, reduce tariffs, relax quotas, and eliminate trade restrictions that hinder U.S. exports (especially agricultural exports), while also demanding that these countries reduce or eliminate domestic taxes and other measures that have a special impact on restricting their purchase of U.S. goods and services." "Particular attention should be paid to maximizing the tariff concessions made by foreign countries in the current tariff negotiations, and to fully benefit U.S. exports from these concessions and previous concessions to the U.S."

	"Continue to take all reasonable means to increase" U.S. exports, "including providing convenient conditions for financing exports when necessary."

	"Continue to recommend that labor and management take all reasonable steps to ensure the competitive position of U.S.-produced goods in export markets," in other words, attempt to lower the cost of U.S. goods by suppressing workers' wages.

	"Insist that" the U.S.'s "friends and allies" bear "the full share" of their expenses in expanding armaments and preparing for war.

	"Continue to urgently insist that" the capitalist world "other economically developed countries increase their "share" of long-term financial "aid" to emerging countries.

	"Reduce and subsequently limit the number of civilian and military personnel's dependents overseas," first of all, the dependents of overseas troops, from the current 480,000 to 200,000, reducing at least 15,000 people per month starting from January 1, 1961. All departments and agencies with personnel stationed abroad should also "take all measures to reduce the number of personnel stationed abroad and their families" under the condition of "not affecting the completion of the U.S.'s basic policy goals."

	"Immediately take all possible steps to substantially reduce" the portion of military supplies purchased by the U.S. military that is intended to be procured overseas, and instruct the U.S. foreign "aid" agency, the "International Cooperation Administration," to adopt such a policy: "Maximize (making the countries accepting U.S. "aid") procure U.S. goods and services with U.S. "aid" funds."

The "Development Loan Fund" (another U.S. foreign "aid" agency) also adopts a similar policy.

The emergency measures even include such trivial content: requiring foreign countries to "encourage their citizens to come to the United States for travel," and "exempt returning passengers from considerable taxes" so that they can spend a lot of money and buy U.S. goods in the United States. "Prohibit the purchase of foreign goods in food stores and department stores operated under the auspices of the State Department or U.S. embassies, unless approved by the Secretary of State or the Deputy Secretary of State."

Western news agencies pointed out that Eisenhower's decision to take these emergency measures just two months before stepping down is enough to show the severity of the U.S. international balance of payments situation. These news agencies estimate that after taking these measures, the U.S. may save about $1 billion in foreign expenditures in 1961. However, even so, at least three-quarters of the U.S.'s annual international payment deficit is still not covered.

Eisenhower has announced that he will convene a meeting of the "National Security Council" (the highest decision-making body of the U.S. ruling group) on the 17th. It is reported that this meeting will further discuss measures to deal with the international payment deficit.

### 美国经济百孔千疮　统治集团胆战心惊  艾森豪威尔宣布采取紧急措施以邻为壑损人利己  加紧对外扩张　多方勒索仆从国家　进一步压榨美国人民

    美国经济百孔千疮　统治集团胆战心惊
    艾森豪威尔宣布采取紧急措施以邻为壑损人利己
    加紧对外扩张　多方勒索仆从国家　进一步压榨美国人民
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：被最近美国国际收支情况的剧烈恶化和黄金迅速外流吓得胆战心惊的美国总统艾森豪威尔，昨天发表了一项指示，宣布采取一系列紧急措施，力图稍稍补塞国际收支方面的一些漏洞。
    艾森豪威尔在他的指示中以及昨天他亲自主持的记者招待会上露骨地对美国的盟国施加压力，要它们在贸易、军费等许多方面牺牲它们的利益，以帮助抢救百孔千疮、正在下沉的美国经济这条破船。
    艾森豪威尔宣布的紧急措施范围很广泛，有些是美国统治集团挖空心思想出来的。然而为了坚持美国在海外的军事和经济扩张，他既不撤退或减少美国在外国的驻军，也不停止或限制垄断资本在海外的投资，从而让美国国际收支恶化的两个主要根源照样存在。他在指示中强调说，美国“将不会削减”它的军事力量，“将不会损害”它的
  “国际经济计划”。
    艾森豪威尔的指示惊呼，西欧国家和日本“这些一度被战争破坏的国家现在已经完全能够在自由世界市场（指资本主义世界市场）上同美国进行竞争了”，美国对它的“盟国”的军事支撑“也造成了美元的流向国外，这主要是由于维持我们驻在外国的军队”。他接着指出，美国的对外经济“援助”也导致美元外流。
    他接着说，“由于上述的和其他的因素，美国一直面临着国际支付差额中持续的赤字”，“造成的赤字是以大量的黄金外流和我们的美元债务的增加来结算的。我们的赤字中一大部分已用黄金结算，结果自从1957年年底以来国库黄金储备下降了大约四十五亿美元（编者注：实际上是四十七亿美元）”。
    美国总统以沮丧的口吻承认，尽管近几年来他已在国内外采取了种种措施企图“帮助改善收支平衡和维持对美元的信心”，但是无法扭转颓势。他提到了在国内采取的金融和财政措施，在国外迫使美国的盟国取消对美国货进口的贸易“障碍”，发起建立国际开发协会以使其他国家分担美国“援”外费用，规定向美国的开发贷款基金会借款的国家必须以借款买美国货，给美国出口商以借款和担保等等。艾森豪威尔说，要不是已采取了这些措施，“我们的支付问题今天会更严重”。但是他叹息说，尽管作了种种努力，尽管美国今年在对外贸易方面情况比1959年好，可能取得大约六十五亿美元的出超，美国的支付逆差“目前为年率三十多亿美元，而且会发展为同1959年的近四十亿美元相差不远（编者注：实际上今年第三季赤字年率达四十三亿美元）”。艾森豪威尔说，今年有着一个“巨大的短期资金外流运动”，
  “最近这种资金流动的数量之大和最近四个月外国货币当局的大量购买黄金，使得我们必须加紧努力进一步改善我们的支付情况”。艾森豪威尔针对他的盟国叫喊说，“改善”美国的国际支付情况“也是为了保证美国在今后继续成为自由世界的经济发展和军事力量方面的强大堡垒”。他同时又承认，“由于我们在世界上面临竞争的条件，以致很难单靠从出口方面扩大我们的现金收入，我们必须把削减政府国外美元支出的某些方面也包括进我们的努力”。
    艾森豪威尔宣布了一系列向美国的盟国、借美国钱的国家和美国工人阶级进攻的措施，其中包括：
      “继续迫切地要求其他国家，特别是那些在经济和财政上强大的国家，降低关税、放宽定额和取消妨碍美国的出口（特别是农产品出口）的贸易限制，同时还要求这些国家减少或取消对于限制它们购买美国货物和劳务有特殊影响的国内赋税和其他措施。”“要特别注意使在目前关税谈判中外国作出的关税让步达到最大限度，并且从这些让步以及以前对美国的让步中使美国的输出得到充分的好处。”
    “继续采取所有合理的手段来增加”美国的出口，“包括在需要时对资助出口提供便利条件”。
    “继续建议劳资双方采取一切合理的步骤来保证美国生产的货物在出口市场上的竞争地位”，换句话说，企图用压低工人工资来降低美国货的成本。
      “坚持要”美国的“朋友和盟国”承担它们在扩军备战的费用中
  “十足的份额”。
    “继续迫切坚持要求”资本主义世界“其他经济上发达的国家增加它们对新兴国家的长期的”财政
  “援助”的“份额”。
      “减少并随后限制文武人员在海外家属的数目”，首先是海外驻军的家属，由目前的四十八万多人减至二十万人，从1961年1月1日起每月至少减少一万五千人。在国外驻有人员的一切部门和机构也应在“不影响美国基本政策目标的完成”的条件下“采取一切措施缩减驻外人员，及其家属的人数”。
      “立即采取一切可能的步骤大量减少”美国三军购买军用物资中打算在海外采购的部分，并且指示美国“援外”机构“国际合作署”采取这样的政策：“最大限度地
  （使接受美“援”的国家）以美国‘援外’经费采购美国货物和劳务”。
    “开发贷款基金会”（另一个美国“援外”机构）也采取类似的政策。
    紧急措施中甚至穷极无聊地包括这样一些内容：要求外国“鼓励它们的国民前来美国旅行”，并
  “对返国的旅客免征相当可观的税额”，以便他们在美国大量花钱并买美国货。“禁止在国务院或美国大使馆主持下经营的食品店和百货商店购买外国货，除非经国务卿、副国务卿亲自批准。”
    西方通讯社指出，还有两个月就要下台的艾森豪威尔竟然决定采取这些紧急措施，足以表明美国国际收支情况的严重程度。这些通讯社估计，采取这些措施以后，美国在1961年可能节省国外支出约十亿美元。但是，即使如此，美国每年国际支付赤字还有至少四分之三没有着落。
    艾森豪威尔已宣布在17日召开
    “国家安全委员会”（美国统治集团的最高决策机构）会议。据报道，这个会议将进一步讨论应付国际支付赤字的措施。
