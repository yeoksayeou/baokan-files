Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 3rd - A mass movement to plant wheat and winter grain crops on a large scale has formed a high tide in Jiangxi Province. Various regions are seizing the late autumn harvest period, adapting to local conditions, devising methods, finding fields, reclaiming lakes and opening up wasteland, vigorously expanding and rushing to plant, striving to increase the production of a spring grain crop.

Jiangxi Province, which mainly grows rice, had very few winter crops in the past. Since the Great Leap Forward, various regions have continuously expanded winter planting of wheat and other grain crops based on local conditions, creating many experiences. Based on this, this year, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the spirit of vigorously developing grain, proposed to the province to change the past small-scale planting and harvesting of winter grain crops into large-scale planting and harvesting, striving to produce more spring grain in addition to rice. Various regions actively responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, and recently, a mass movement to expand the planting of overwintering crops has been universally launched.

In the movement of planting winter wheat and winter grain on a large scale, various regions have comprehensively arranged crop rotations, grasping both dry land sowing and paddy field expansion. All rice areas, based on the experience that the transplanting season for single-season medium and late rice fields is relatively late, and as long as wheat is seized for quick planting and harvesting, it will not delay the transplanting season, are making extensive use of single-season medium and late rice fields to expand winter wheat planting. Yifeng County has 200,000 mu of single-season late rice fields that were idle in the past, but this year, through comprehensive planning, more than 102,000 mu will be planted with wheat. Jinxian County, which has achieved a bumper wheat harvest for two consecutive years, is even more determined and energetic to expand wheat planting in rice fields this year, with the county's wheat planting area soaring to 300,000 mu.

In double-cropping rice areas, various regions are actively taking effective measures to vigorously engage in three rice-wheat cropping seasons. Leping and Pingxiang have adopted the method of "寄秧" (jiyang - transplanting seedlings elsewhere temporarily) used in some areas last year (that is, when transplanting early rice, first store the seedlings from the wheat-planted fields in the seedling fields or transplant them among the rows of other early rice, and then transplant them after the wheat is harvested) to solve the contradiction between rice and wheat competing for time and land, selecting areas with good water sources, fertile soil, and abundant fertilizer to implement three rice-wheat cropping seasons, increasing winter wheat planting by more than 100,000 mu. These areas are now concentrating leadership and labor to speed up harvesting and planting.

Various economic crop areas have also adopted various methods such as intercropping to increase the planting of wheat and other grain crops. Pengze County, a key cotton-producing area in the province, is promoting the cotton-wheat intercropping experience of the Jiangbei Commune this year, and has intercropped more than 15,000 mu of wheat. Cotton and hemp producing areas in Hukou, Ruichang, and Duchang counties have also universally promoted cotton-wheat and hemp-wheat intercropping. Nankang County intercrops wheat and broad beans in sugarcane fields.

Based on the spirit of planting more and more, various regions have marched into the mountains and sought grain from the lakes, extensively carrying out land reclamation movements. Counties along Poyang Lake have reclaimed 210,000 mu of lake fields and shoals, and more than 100,000 mu have been planted with wheat, barley, and beans. Many mountain areas have also organized a large number of laborers to enter the mountains and forests, set up camps on the spot, and cultivate on the spot, planting wheat and other crops on high mountains and forest land. In addition, various regions have fully mobilized the masses to use "ten-edge" land to increase the planting of broad beans, peas, and other minor grains.

In order to ensure good planting, cadres at all levels throughout the province have gone deep into the forefront of winter planting, participating in and leading winter planting, and have established "three-combination" experimental fields and high-yield fields together with old farmers and commune members. According to incomplete statistics, more than 300,000 mu of various types of experimental fields and high-yield fields have been planted.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 3rd - Various regions in Zhejiang Province are actively promoting the new three-cropping system according to local conditions, in order to fully exploit the potential of the land, expand the planting area of spring grain crops, and strive to receive more spring grain next year.

Zhejiang Province is one of the provinces with the least amount of land per capita in the country. Therefore, one of the important ways to increase grain production is to plant one more season and harvest one more crop as much as possible on the existing land. The new three-cropping system is to plant a season of barley, wheat and other spring grains in the rice fields in winter in addition to double-cropping rice.

In the process of promoting the new three-cropping system, various regions have extensively and deeply carried out propaganda and education on vigorously developing agriculture and grain, and by summarizing the experience of increasing production with the new three-cropping system, mobilized the masses to expand the area of the new three-cropping system based on local natural conditions, different soil types, water conservancy, etc. After Shaoxing County summarized and publicized the experience of Donghu Farm in promoting the new three-cropping system to increase production, it greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of commune members to promote the new three-cropping system, and the area of spring flowers planted this winter has rapidly expanded. After learning from the experience of Donghu Farm, Fucheng Commune plans to expand the planting of spring grain by more than 1,100 mu this year, making the area of new three-cropping next year 34% larger than this year. In order to promote the new three-cropping system, Jinyun County summarized the experience of increasing production at all levels. This year, the county plans to plant spring flowers on 91% of the cultivated land, of which the planting area of wheat and barley will increase by 27% compared with last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 2nd - Hunan Province is making full use of winter-fallow rice fields and vacant land in dry lands this autumn to expand the planting of winter wheat, striving to plant one more season of grain.

Before communization, many people in rural Hunan did not pay enough attention to wheat planting, thinking that wheat was a "minor grain" and a "low-yielding crop." Therefore, the planting area was small and the cultivation was rough. After communization, people liberated their minds and reformed the cultivation system. In addition, the achievements of farmland capital construction such as large-scale water conservancy and soil improvement in recent years have created favorable conditions for sowing wheat. Last year, the wheat sowing area in the province increased compared to the previous year, accumulating rich experience for further wheat sowing this year.

This year, Hunan Province plans to plant wheat in some of the fields that originally only harvested one season of mid-season rice or one season of late-season rice. Since rice field wheat planting is still a new thing in many areas, before sowing, all regions have comprehensively summarized the typical experience of rice field wheat planting in the past. Yongxing County concluded that there are three major benefits of converting winter-irrigated rice fields to wheat planting: first, it increases the utilization rate of cultivated land; second, it improves the soil and transforms low-yielding into high-yielding; and third, it can harvest more grain. Therefore, everyone is very enthusiastic about sowing wheat. Since October 7, the county has mobilized more than 70,000 people every day to dig ditches for drainage, improve the soil, apply fertilizer and sow seeds. By the 15th, more than 40,000 mu of wheat had been planted. All regions planned comprehensively according to local conditions, paid attention to the connection between the front and rear crops. Winter wheat has a long growing period, and winter wheat is generally planned to be planted in mid-season rice and single-season late-season rice fields. Many areas also make full use of dry land to plant wheat. Last year, Qidong County planted more than 40,000 mu of wheat in the preliminarily improved red soil, and this year the wheat planting area will be more than doubled compared with last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd - Tibetan peasants are expanding the planting area of ​​winter wheat and winter highland barley, striving to harvest two crops a year on some land on the plateau.

Bomi, Milin, Linzhi, Motuo and other counties in the Linzhi Prefecture, where the climate is warmer, are currently rushing to plant winter wheat and winter highland barley. The planting area will be much larger than last year.

In other areas where there is no habit of planting winter wheat, trial planting is also being carried out more widely this year. Nine of the twelve counties in the Shannan Prefecture are starting to sow seeds one after another. In addition to using the excellent varieties of winter wheat transported from the mainland, farmers are also selecting good varieties from the local highland barley and wheat for trial planting. Jiangzi, Xigaze, Qamdo and other prefectures and agricultural counties in the Lhasa area have also begun to trial planting on a relatively large scale this year.

Due to the cold climate on the Tibetan Plateau, Tibetan farmers use good land facing the sun and away from the wind to sow winter wheat, and generally plow two or three times, apply a lot of base fertilizer, and promote strip planting and reasonable close planting.

For thousands of years, most areas on the Tibetan Plateau have only harvested one crop a year. Only in individual places with lower sea levels in the east and south do they have the habit of planting winter wheat. During the period of feudal serfdom, Tibetan farmers bore heavy Ula corvée labor, and had no intention of trying to plant two-season crops. Even in areas where two seasons could be planted, they often only planted one season.

After the democratic reform, Tibetan farmers, who became the masters of the land, were determined to overcome nature and change the history of Tibet only being able to harvest one crop. Last year, some farmers immediately boldly tried to plant winter wheat and winter highland barley after the autumn harvest. The several hundred mu of winter wheat and winter highland barley planted by farmers in Zhangda Township, Milin County last year yielded more than 300 jin of grain per mu this year, and the harvesting time was more than a month earlier than that of spring wheat. Facts have proved that winter wheat can not only be planted on the Tibetan Plateau, but also high yields and double cropping can be achieved. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, farmers in various places immediately carried out plowing and sowing after this year's autumn harvest. Many of the winter wheat sown this year are excellent varieties from the mainland. Shandong Province alone supported 250,000 jin of good varieties such as "Qianjiao" and "Bima No. 1". The Lhasa Agricultural Experimental Farm has also cultivated a batch of excellent varieties for Tibetan farmers.

    江西浙江湖南扩大冬播面积推广稻麦三熟或稻麦两熟
    耕种冬闲地　增产一季粮
    西藏翻身农民抢种冬小麦冬青稞力争部分土地一年收获两次庄稼
    本报南昌3日电　江西省一个大种小麦、大种冬季粮食作物的群众运动已在各地形成高潮。各地抓紧秋收后期，因地制宜，想办法，找田地，垦湖开荒，大力扩种抢种，力争多增产一季春粮。
    以种水稻为主的江西省，过去冬种作物很少。大跃进以来，各地因地制宜不断扩大冬种小麦等粮食作物，创造了许多经验。在这个基础上，今年中共江西省委根据大办粮食的精神，向全省提出变过去冬种粮食作物的小种小收为大种大收的号召，争取在稻谷之外更多增产一季春粮。各地积极响应省委号召，最近以来，普遍掀起了扩种越冬作物的群众运动。
    在大种冬麦、大种冬粮的运动中，各地全面安排了作物茬口，既抓旱地播种，又抓水田扩种。各个水稻地区根据一季中、晚稻田插秧季节较晚，只要抓紧小麦抢种抢收，完全不误插秧季节的经验，大量利用一季中、晚稻田扩种冬麦。宜丰县有二十万亩一季晚稻田过去都是空闲过冬的，今年通过全面规划，有十万二千多亩将种上小麦。连续两年获得小麦丰收的进贤县，今年利用稻田扩种小麦的决心更大，干劲更足，全县种麦面积猛增到三十万亩。
    在双季稻地区，各地积极采取有效措施大搞稻麦三熟。乐平、萍乡采取去年一些地方插“寄秧”的办法（就是到早稻插秧时，先把种麦田的秧苗寄存在秧田里或寄插在别的早稻行间，待小麦收割后再移植过来），解决稻麦争时争地矛盾，选择水源好、土质肥和肥料充裕的地区实行稻麦三熟，共增种冬麦十万多亩。现在这些地区都正在集中领导、集中劳力加紧抢收抢种。
    各个经济作物区，也采取套种、间种等各种办法增种小麦等粮食作物。全省重点产棉区彭泽县，今年推广江北公社棉麦套种经验，已套种小麦一万五千多亩。湖口、瑞昌、都昌等县棉、麻产区也都普遍推广了棉麦、麻麦套种。南康县则在甘蔗田里套种大小麦和蚕豌豆。
    各地本着多种再多种的精神，向山进军，向湖要粮，广泛开展了垦荒运动。鄱阳湖滨各县已开垦湖田洲地二十一万多亩，并有十万多亩抢种上了小麦、大麦和豆类等作物。许多靠山地区也组织大批劳力进山入林，就地安营，就地垦种，把小麦等种上高山、林地。此外，各地还充分发动群众利用“十边”土地，增种蚕豆、豌豆等小杂粮。
    为了保证多种种好，全省各级干部都深入冬种第一线，参加冬种，领导冬种，并同老农、社员一起建立了“三结合”试验田、丰产田。据不完全统计，各种不同类型的试验田、丰产田已种下约三十多万亩。
    据新华社杭州3日电　浙江省各地因地制宜积极推广新三熟制，以充分发挥土地潜力，扩大春花粮食种植面积，争取明年收到更多的春粮。
    浙江省是全国按人口平均占有土地最少的省份之一，因此增产粮食的重要途径之一，是在现有土地上尽量多种一季，多收一熟。新三熟制就是在水稻田里除了种双季稻以外，冬天再种一季大麦、小麦等春粮。
    各地在推行新三熟制中，广泛深入地展开大办农业，大办粮食的宣传教育，通过总结新三熟制增产经验，发动群众根据当地自然条件，不同的土质、水利等，因地制宜地扩大新三熟制面积。如绍兴县总结宣传了东湖农场推行新三熟制的增产经验以后，大大地鼓舞了社员推广新三熟制的积极性，今年冬种的春花面积迅速扩大。富盛公社学习东湖农场经验以后，今年准备扩种春粮一千一百多亩，使明年的新三熟面积比今年扩大34％。缙云县为推行新三熟制，层层总结了增产经验。今年全县准备种植春花的面积达到耕地面积的91％，其中大小麦的种植面积将比去年增加27％。
    据新华社长沙2日电　湖南省今秋充分利用冬闲稻田和旱土隙地扩种冬小麦，力争多种一季粮。
    公社化前，湖南农村许多人对种植小麦不够重视，认为小麦是“杂粮”、是“低产作物”，因此播种面积小，耕作粗放。公社化后，人们解放思想，改革耕作制度；加上几年来大兴水利、改良土壤等农田基本建设的成就，都为播种小麦创造了有利条件。去年全省小麦播种面积较前增加，为今年进一步播种小麦积累了丰富经验。
    今年湖南省准备把一部分原来只收一季中稻或一季晚稻的田都种上小麦。由于稻田种麦在许多地区还是一件新事情，因此在播种前，各地都全面总结了过去稻田种麦的典型经验。永兴县总结出冬浸稻田改种小麦有三大好处：一是提高耕地利用率；二是改良土壤，变低产为高产；三是能多收粮食。因此，大家播种小麦的劲头很大。从10月7日起，全县每天出动七万多人，边挖沟排水，边改良土壤，边施肥播种，到15日止已种小麦四万多亩。各地都因地制宜，全面规划，注意前后作物的衔接，小麦生长期较长，冬小麦一般规划种在中稻、一季晚稻田里。许多地区还充分利用旱土种小麦。祁东县去年在经过初步改良的红壤土地里种麦四万多亩，今年小麦播种面积将较去年扩大两倍多。
    新华社拉萨2日电　西藏农民扩大冬小麦和冬青稞的播种面积，力争在高原上也能够有一些土地一年收获两次庄稼。
    气候较暖和的林芝专区的波密、米林、林芝、墨脱等县，目前正在突击播种冬小麦和冬青稞，播种面积将比去年扩大很多。
    在其他没有种植冬麦习惯的地区，今年也比较普遍地进行试种。山南专区的十二个县，有九个县正在陆续下种，农民们除采用从内地运来的冬小麦优良品种外，还从当地出产的青稞、小麦中选择良种试播。江孜、日喀则、昌都等专区和拉萨地区各农业县，今年也开始比较大量地试种。
    由于西藏高原气候寒冷，藏族农民都把背风向阳的好地用来播种冬麦，而且一般都深翻二三遍，底肥施得特别多，还推广了条播和合理密植。
    西藏高原上绝大部分地区千百年来都只收一季庄稼，只有东部和南部个别拔海较低的地方有种冬麦的习惯。在封建农奴制度统治时期，藏族农民负担的乌拉差役繁重，无心试种两季作物，就是可以种两季的地区，也往往只种一季。
    民主改革以后，成为土地主人的藏族农民决心战胜自然，改变西藏只能收获一季庄稼的历史。去年有的地方的农民在秋收后马上又大胆试种了冬小麦和冬青稞。米林县章达乡农民去年播种的几百亩冬小麦和冬青稞，今年每亩收获了三百多斤粮食，收割时间也比春麦早一个月以上。事实证明：西藏高原上不仅能够播种冬麦，而且可以获得高产和进行复种。因此，各地农民在党的领导下，在今年秋收后紧接着就进行翻地播种。今年播种的冬小麦中，有许多是内地的优良品种，仅山东省支援来的“钱交”、“碧玛一号”等良种就有二十五万斤。拉萨农业试验场也为藏族农民培植了一批优良品种。
