Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th: Under the leadership of the County Party Committee, the financial and trade departments of Fuxin Mongolian Autonomous County, Liaoning Province, have joined forces with the industrial and scientific research departments to form ten agricultural support networks. Without increasing personnel, these networks ensure that the county, communes, and brigades are organized at every level, creating an integrated system where all sectors support agriculture from production to daily life.

The ten networks are:

	(1) Investigation and Research Network: Composed of relevant personnel from industrial and commercial departments and experienced commune members. The county has an investigation and research office, the commune has an investigation and research station, and the team has an investigation and research group. Before each agricultural season, based on production plans, they investigate the rural areas' needs for production materials, daily necessities, and funds, as well as existing quantities, providing reliable data for communes and industrial and commercial departments.

	(2) Agricultural Implement Reform Research Network: At the county level, representatives from industrial, agricultural, scientific research departments, and the agricultural implement testing factory of the financial and trade departments form a technical transformation office. Communes and production teams also form research groups with relevant personnel, regularly studying agricultural implement reform and promoting new and improved agricultural implements in conjunction with production and work.

	(3) Agricultural Implement Repair and Manufacturing Network: With the assistance of industrial and commercial departments, each commune in the county has established an agricultural implement repair and manufacturing factory, brigades have established repair stations, and teams have established repair groups, basically achieving the goal of minor repairs within the team, medium repairs within the commune, and major repairs within the county.

	(4) Technology Dissemination Network: The county-level industrial, agricultural, and commercial departments form ten technology dissemination teams, each responsible for a specific commune to assist in installing various machines, training technical personnel, and resolving technical difficulties.

	(5) Material and Capital Supply Network: Commercial, financial, and banking units establish joint offices at the county and commune levels, decentralizing some of the supply and marketing cooperative's business to brigade stores, while also organizing seventy-three mobile service groups. Through a combination of fixed and mobile supply methods, supplies are provided wherever there is production, and whenever they are needed.

	(6) Agricultural and Sideline Product Procurement Network: At the county level, the grain department, supply and marketing cooperative, and other units' procurement personnel form a collaboration group. At the commune level, grain management personnel and the supply and marketing cooperative establish a general station for agricultural and sideline product procurement management, with substations in brigades, responsible for the procurement of grain and other agricultural and sideline products.

	(7) Comprehensive Utilization of Agricultural and Sideline Products Network: Under the organization of the native produce company, grain bureau, and other units, communes establish command posts, and brigades establish groups. Various departments throughout the county have already helped communes and production teams establish a number of commodity production bases that are both agricultural and industrial, as well as processing organizations for starch, fiber, non-staple food, mats, grass bags, grass ropes, and willow products.

	(8) Life Services Network: The county and town financial and trade departments form life service teams to help communes and production teams improve service outlets and provide guidance and assistance in business operations. They assisted public canteens in developing household production, and universally established two gardens (vegetable garden, sauce garden) and three farms (pig farm, chicken farm, rabbit farm).

	(9) Financial Accounting Network: The county and commune financial and banking institutions form a financial accounting guidance network. Production teams form accounting groups composed of credit cooperative resident accountants, and teams have accountants to promote good financial management and improve business management in communes and production teams.

	(10) Propaganda Network: Members of the agricultural support committees at all levels and the above networks all concurrently manage propaganda work. Under the leadership of the commune Party committee's propaganda department, they provide services while simultaneously promoting the Party's policies, ensuring that they are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, mobilizing the masses to ensure the completion of central tasks, and simultaneously completing the tasks of various departments.

After Fuxin County implemented the ten agricultural support networks, the pace of agricultural support across all sectors became more consistent, forces became more concentrated, and collaboration became closer. The financial and trade departments' work in supporting agriculture also became more practical and effective with the full cooperation of all parties. For example, before the autumn harvest, the agricultural implement reform research network and the agricultural implement repair and manufacturing network, while conducting trial production, also investigated needs. Industrial and commercial departments at all levels jointly arranged production and jointly solved raw material problems. After two months of concentrated effort, they manufactured more than 1,200 high-efficiency tools of more than ten types, such as universal threshers, harvesters, and winnowing machines, and delivered them to the forefront of production in advance. At the same time, more than 100 cadres and technicians were organized to help communes and teams make comprehensive use of power equipment. Of the county's 427 locomobile boilers, diesel engines, and other power machinery, 276 achieved multiple uses, not only saving a large amount of labor but also greatly accelerating the progress of the autumn harvest. The agricultural implement repair and manufacturing network launched three agricultural implement repair and assembly campaigns this year, repairing more than 18,000 various agricultural implements. The technology dissemination network trained 135 power machinery operators, 1,200 technicians for indigenous pesticides and fertilizers, and more than 1,560 mechanical repairmen for communes and production brigades. The financial accounting network trained 140 commune and team financial personnel and launched a movement to clean up commune and team finances, which played a certain role in doing a good job in autumn harvest distribution. The ten networks forming a dragon has given financial and trade work a wider mass base. As a result, the county completed the procurement plan for agricultural and sideline products in the third quarter of this year, ten days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by 11%.

    财贸、工业、科学等部门紧密协作全面为农业服务
    阜新县建立支援农业十大网
    据新华社沈阳13日电　辽宁省阜新蒙古族自治县财贸部门在县委领导下，联合工业、科学研究等部门的力量，分别组成十个支援农业网，在不增加人员的情况下，做到县、公社、大队层层有组织，形成一个各行各业从生产到生活支援农业的整体。
    这十个网是：
      （一）调查研究网：由工商部门有关人员和有经验的社员组成。县有调查研究室，社有调查研究站，队有调查研究组。他们在每个农业季节到来之前，根据生产规划，调查农村对生产资料、生活资料和资金的需要情况和已有的数量，为公社和工业、财贸部门提供可靠的资料。
      （二）农具改革研究网：县一级，由工业、农业、科学研究部门、财贸部门的农具试验厂的代表，组成技术改造办公室，公社和生产队也由有关人员组成研究小组，结合生产和工作，经常研究农具改革，推广新式农具和改良农具。
      （三）农具修配制造网：在工、商等部门的协助下，全县每个公社都建立了农具修配制造厂，大队建立了修配站，小队建立了修配组，基本实现了农业机具小修不出队，中修不出社，大修不出县。
      （四）技术传播网：由县一级工业、农业、商业部门组成十个技术传播队，按全县十个公社分片包干，专门负责帮助公社安装各种机具和训练技术人员，解决技术上的困难。
      （五）物资资金供应网：由商业、财政、银行等单位，在县、社两级建立联合办公室，将供销社的一部分业务下放到大队商店，同时组织了七十三个流动服务组。通过固定与流动相结合的供应办法，做到哪里有生产、哪里有供应，什么时候需要，什么时候供应。
    （六）农副产品收购网：县由粮食部门、供销社等单位主管收购人员组成协作组，社由粮食管理人员和供销社成立农副产品收购管理总站，大队设分站，负责粮食和其他农副产品的收购等工作。
    （七）农副产品综合利用网：在土产公司、粮食局等单位的组织下，社设指挥部，大队设组。全县各部门已经帮助公社、生产队建立了一批亦农亦工的商品生产基地和淀粉、纤维、副食品、席子、草袋、草绳、柳条制品等加工组织。
    （八）生活服务网：由县、镇财贸部门组成生活服务队，帮助公社、生产队健全服务网点，并在业务上进行指导帮助。他们协助公共食堂开展了家底生产，普遍建立了两园（菜园、酱园）三场（猪场、鸡场、兔场）。
    （九）财务核算网：由县、社财政、银行机构组成财务核算指导网，生产队由信用部驻队会计组成核算组，小队设有核算员，促进公社、生产队管理好财务，改善经营管理。
      （十）宣传网：各级支援农业委员会和以上各网成员中，都有人兼管宣传工作，在公社党委宣传部门领导下，边服务、边宣传，使党的方针政策深入人心，发动群众保证完成中心任务，同时完成各部门任务。
    阜新县实现支援农业十网以后，各行各业支援农业的步调更加一致，力量更加集中，协作更加密切，也使财贸部门支援农业的工作，在各方面通力协作下，做得更踏实、有力。例如，在秋收以前，农具改革研究网和农具修配制造网，一面进行试制，一面调查需要，各级工商部门共同安排生产，共同解决原料材料问题，经过两个月的突击，制造出万能脱谷机、收割机、扬场机等十几种一千二百多台高效率的工具，提前送到生产第一线。同时组织了一百多名干部和技术人员，帮助社、队大搞动力设备综合利用。全县四百二十七台锅驼机、柴油机等动力机械，有二百七十六台达到了一机多用，不仅节省了大批劳动力，也使秋收进度大大加快。农具修配制造网今年先后掀起了三次农具大修配高潮，共修好各种农具一万八千多件。技术传播网为公社、生产大队培养出动力机械操作手一百三十五人，土农药、土化肥技术员一千二百人，各种机械修配员一千五百六十多人。财务核算网培养了社、队财务人员一百四十人，开展了清理社、队财务的运动，对做好秋收分配工作起了一定的作用。十网成龙，使财贸工作具有更为广泛的群众基础，因此全县今年第三季度提前十天超额11％完成了农副产品收购计划。
