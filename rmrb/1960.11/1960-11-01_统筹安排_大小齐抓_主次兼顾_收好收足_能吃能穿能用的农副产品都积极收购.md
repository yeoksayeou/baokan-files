Tibetan Farmers and Herdsmen Enthusiastically Sell Hides and Medicinal Materials

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 31st - Commercial departments in Sichuan Province have adopted the method of "seizing both big and small, attending to both primary and secondary, making overall arrangements, and ensuring the effectiveness of each," to vigorously purchase major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, oil, and hemp, while also seizing the opportunity to purchase rural sideline products and local specialties. Purchase plans have been arranged for cotton stalks, ramie, raw lacquer, rosin, gallnuts, Chinese medicinal materials, daylilies, tree ears, walnuts, etc., and some have already begun to be purchased and transferred out.

As early as the third quarter, Sichuan Province's commercial departments, together with relevant departments, investigated the production of minor agricultural and sideline products, made timely purchases, and strived to "not lose the small while grasping the big." The commercial departments of Nanchong Prefecture categorized various small local products, implemented purchase plans at all levels, and established production bases for twenty-four varieties such as aromatic oils and dried fruits in the entire district, and introduced improved varieties such as white melon seeds and fragrant turmeric from other regions. Due to starting from production, overall planning, and expanding the source of goods, the district added more than 110 new purchase varieties.

Commercial departments in various regions adopted various methods to organize the masses to pick and sell, according to the production characteristics of small local specialties. Wangcang County organized commune members to incidentally dig pinellia and cyperus during weeding, to dig wenma and black ginseng during mountain lacquer cutting, and to peel eucommia when logging, achieving "attending to both primary and secondary." In ten days of September, the province purchased more than 447,000 catties of various Chinese medicinal materials. According to the characteristics of tree ear picking, which is time-sensitive and requires a lot of labor, Pingwu County organized the commune production teams and canteens to reasonably arrange labor for picking, and transferred 50% of the personnel from the commercial departments' factories and service industries to lead town residents and students on vacation to participate in the tree ear picking rush. The county quickly purchased more than 5,000 catties of tree ears, an increase of nearly half compared to last year.

In order to ensure good and sufficient collection of various agricultural and sideline products, Sichuan Province's commercial departments widely publicized the policy on agricultural and sideline product procurement among the masses. Wanxian, Jiangjin, Yibin and other prefectures used big-character posters, blackboards, and local broadcasts during commune members' meetings, meals, or market days to repeatedly explain to commune members the important significance of selling agricultural and sideline products to support national construction, and explained the specific purchase policies for various agricultural and sideline products. Therefore, the broad masses of commune members actively sold agricultural and sideline products.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 31st - Commercial departments in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region actively purchase rural sideline products such as livestock products and wild plants. As of October 10th, the total value of sheep, wool, wild miscellaneous fibers, wild oilseeds, wild starch, crude alkali, fire saltpeter, woven products, etc. purchased throughout the region had increased by 20% to more than double compared to the same period last year.

Before the peak season for agricultural and sideline product purchases arrived, commercial departments in various regions, under the leadership of the Party Committee, helped communes and production teams plan production, explore resources, establish processing plants, and train purchasing technicians, making various preparations. After the peak season arrived, more than 70% of the staff in commercial departments throughout the region were put into the front line of purchasing. The Hangjin Houqi commercial department transferred more than 200 purchasing personnel to go deep into the commune squads, canteens, and fields, participating in labor while carrying out publicity, organizing production, and conducting purchasing. The broad masses of commune members launched a collection campaign of "bringing a knife to the ground and picking a little on the way back," collecting more than 9.1 million catties of various wild plants in more than a month, and retting and storing 5.24 million catties of flax stalks. The entire banner exceeded the annual purchase plan for sideline products by more than 100 days ahead of schedule. The commercial departments in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas such as Siziwang Banner and Chahar Right Wing Middle Banner in Ulanqab League transferred 80% of their staff to go deep into the grasslands, helping the commune organize professional shearing teams, and adopting the method of "determining production by sheep, grouping and lining up, concentrating shearing, and unified sales," increasing the average wool production per sheep by two liang, and exceeding the autumn wool purchase plan in more than ten days.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa - Currently, it is the peak season for Tibetan local specialties to be on the market. While strengthening purchasing work, state-owned trading departments in various regions have transferred sufficient materials to supply farmers and herdsmen. From January to September this year, farmers and herdsmen throughout the region have sold 2.3 million catties of wool and 450,000 various hides to the state, as well as various precious medicinal materials such as musk, cordyceps, rhinoceros horn, and fritillaria.

State-owned trading departments vigorously purchase local specialties, which greatly increased the income of farmers and herdsmen and further improved their lives. In the first nine months of this year alone, the masses earned 3 million yuan from selling wool, hides, and medicinal materials. During the gap before the autumn harvest, farmers and herdsmen in Woka District, Sangri County, went up the mountains three times to dig medicinal materials, increasing the average income of each of the 1,300 people in the district by more than eight yuan. Almost every household in this district bought tea and daily necessities from the supply and marketing cooperative, and many people added woolen clothes, woolen pants, rubber shoes, and agricultural tools.

This year, Tibet's agricultural and pastoral production and local specialty production have both achieved bumper harvests. In order to allow the masses to buy what they need and love after the autumn harvest and selling local specialties, state-owned trading institutions at all levels have prepared a large amount of materials and added 197 new stores and supply points.

    统筹安排　大小齐抓　主次兼顾　收好收足
    能吃能穿能用的农副产品都积极收购
    四川见缝插针采集出售土特产
    内蒙古绒毛等收购量超过去年
    西藏农民牧民踊跃卖皮张药材
    新华社成都31日电　四川省商业部门采取“大小都抓，主次兼顾，统筹安排，各收其效”的办法，在大抓粮、棉、油、麻等主要农产品收购工作的同时，抓紧收购农村副业产品和土特产品。棉秆麻、生漆、松香、五倍子、中药材、黄花、木耳、核桃等，都已安排了收购计划，有的已经开始收购、外调。
    早在第三季度，四川省商业部门就和有关部门一起，调查了小宗农副产品的生产情况，及时收购，力争“抓大不丢小”。南充专区商业部门对各种小土产进行了品种排队，层层落实收购计划，并在全区建立了芳香油、果干等二十四个品种的生产基地，从外地引进了白瓜子、香茝等良种。由于从生产入手，统筹安排，扩大了货源，全区新增的收购品种达一百一十多个。
    各地商业部门根据小土特产品的生产特点，采取多种方式组织群众采摘、出售。旺苍县组织公社社员除草时捎带挖半夏、香附子，利用上山割漆的空隙时间挖文麻、黑参，伐木时结合剥杜仲，作到了“主次兼顾”。9月份十天当中，全省就收购到各种中药材四十四万七千多斤。平武县根据木耳采摘的时间性强、需要劳力多的特点，一面组织公社生产队、食堂合理安排劳力进行采摘，一面从商业部门办的工厂、服务行业中抽调出50％的人员，带领场镇居民和假期学生，一起参加木耳采摘突击运动。全县很快就收购到木耳五千多斤，比去年增加将近一半。
    为了收好收足各种农副产品，四川省商业部门在群众中广泛开展了关于农副产品采购政策的宣传。万县、江津、宜宾等专区在社员开会、吃饭或赶场的时间，运用大字报、黑板报和土广播等向社员反复讲解了出售农副产品对支援国家建设的重要意义，说明了各种农副产品的具体收购政策。因此，广大社员都积极出售农副产品。
    据新华社呼和浩特31日电　内蒙古自治区商业部门积极收购畜产品、野生植物等农村副业产品。到10月10日，全区收购到的羊、绒毛和野杂纤维、野生油料、野生淀粉、土碱、火硝、编织品等，总值都比去年同期增长20％到一倍以上。
    农副产品收购旺季到来以前，各地商业部门在党委的领导下，帮助公社、生产队规划生产，勘探资源，建立加工厂，培养收购技术人员，作好了各种准备工作。旺季来临以后，全区商业部门70％以上的职工都投入了收购第一线。杭锦后旗商业部门抽调二百多名收购人员深入公社小队、食堂、田间，边参加劳动，边开展宣传，边组织生产，边进行收购。广大社员开展了“下地带把刀，回来挑一挑”的采集运动，在一个多月时间内就采集各种野生植物九百一十多万斤，并且沤制和收藏胡麻秆五百二十四万斤。全旗提前一百多天超额完成了副业产品的全年收购计划。乌兰察布盟四子王旗，察哈尔右翼中旗等半农半牧区的商业部门，抽调80％的职工深入草原，帮助公社组织专业剪毛队，采取“以羊定产，分群排队，集中剪毛，统一交售”的办法，每只羊平均增产羊毛二两，在十多天时间内就超额完成了秋毛收购计划。
    据新华社拉萨电　目前正是西藏土特产品上市的旺季，各地国营贸易部门在加强收购工作的同时，调运了充足的物资供应给农牧民。从今年1月到9月，全区农牧民已经卖给国家二百三十万斤羊毛和四十五万张各种皮张，还有麝香、虫草、犀角、贝母等各种名贵药材。
    国营贸易部门大力收购土特产品，大大增加了农牧民的收入，进一步改善了他们的生活。今年的前九个月中，群众仅出售羊毛、皮张、药材三项就收入三百万元。桑日县沃卡区农牧民趁秋收前的间隙，三次上山挖药材，全区一千三百人平均每人增加八元多的收入。这个区几乎家家户户都从供销社买了茶叶和日用品，不少人添置了绒衣、绒裤、胶鞋、农具等。
    今年西藏农牧业生产和土特产生产都告丰收，为了让群众在秋收和出售土特产后能买到自己需要和喜爱的东西，各级国营贸易机构准备了大量物资，并增设了门市部和供应点一百九十七处。
