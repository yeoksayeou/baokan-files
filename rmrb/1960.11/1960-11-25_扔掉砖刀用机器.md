    Throw Away the Brick Trowel and Use Machines
    By Our Reporter Zhang Zhilin
    In December 1959, Chen Shilin, as a skilled worker in promoting advanced bricklaying tools from the First Construction Engineering Company of Guizhou Province, was responsible for operating and explaining the mortar-spreading machine at the provincial exhibition of technological innovation and revolution in the industrial, transportation, and capital construction systems. The exhibition was an infinitely rich treasure trove, with a dazzling array of innovative machines filling the display rooms upstairs and downstairs. However, in the bricklaying innovation machine display room, besides a few operation diagrams and some statistical charts showing the increase in work efficiency, the only actual objects on display were a few wooden mortar-spreading machines.
    “Can bricklaying be done with machines?” Chen Shilin wondered. He had thought about this question more than once, but this time, an irresistible temptation suddenly increased, gripping his heart more and more strongly. He couldn't eat well or sleep soundly. Even when he unintentionally saw a jeep speeding past, he couldn't help but hallucinate an image of a bricklaying wall machine speeding along the bricklaying line.
      The First Draft
    The desire to create a bricklaying machine tormented him, and he could no longer suppress this urgent feeling. One day, he plucked up the courage to find an engineering technician from the Provincial Construction Engineering Department and expressed this long-held wish. After listening to his description, the technician shook his head repeatedly and said, "Difficult, this is a real machine; have you studied mechanical manufacturing?" This response was more painful for Chen Shilin than not completing his work quota or falling behind in a production competition. What to do! Should he give up or find another way? He pondered this for several days in confusion. Sometimes he thought: What people say is right, according to my idea, the bricklaying machine should be able to automatically spread mortar, lay bricks, and also automatically squeeze the mortar and smooth it... it's probably more complicated than a machine, but what ability do I have? I only studied for three years in elementary school. At other times, he thought: Not entirely right! There are many new machines in the exhibition hall, aren't they also made by ordinary workers? Can they do inventions, but I can't? Besides, the Party has repeatedly called on us to break superstitions, liberate our minds, and seek high efficiency and labor through technological innovation and revolution.... Thinking of this, the scene of the high-efficiency competition organized by the bricklaying team not long ago lingered in his mind....
    At that time, because he had carefully and actively learned from the advanced experience of bricklayers in other places, and mastered the operation of the mortar-spreading machine relatively skillfully, he took the lead, gradually increasing the daily bricklaying efficiency from around 3,600 bricks to 10,096 bricks. How happy Chen Shilin was! He wanted to make another effort to break through the 11,000-brick mark. However, even with all his effort, it was difficult to increase the efficiency any further.
    Without finding a way out through technological innovation and revolution, how difficult it is to lay one more brick. He no longer hesitated and went to discuss with an old foreman who had worked in the same company. The old foreman enthusiastically encouraged him:
  "Right! We should revolutionize the brick trowel and mortar bucket." And he suggested that he work hard to do ideological mobilization work with that technician, strive for his help, and get the draft out.
    Chen Shilin felt confident and thought about a lot of reasons for making a bricklaying machine, preparing to talk to the technician in detail. But as soon as he opened his mouth, he got confused and had to say bluntly, "Comrade Technician, I also understand that it may not be possible to succeed in making such a machine once or twice, or in three or five months, but I'm determined to make it; I only ask you to help me draw a draft according to my idea, drawing a picture doesn't mean failure."
    The technician was persuaded by this tenacious young man. The two sat down, one talking and one drawing, and drew the first draft of the bricklaying machine. By this time, time had quickly entered the first spring of the 1960s.
          When Difficulties Weigh Heavily
    The real difficulties began. Motors, belts, chains, gears... a lot of materials and castings needed to be found and processed one by one. After the materials were ready, they had to be assembled and tested one by one. Chen Shilin didn't understand carpentry, mechanical technology, electricity, or... In short, many new things needed him to explore, familiarize himself with, and master.
    At this time, the company's Party committee, the workshop branch, and the partners of the bricklaying team extended enthusiastic hands to him from all directions. The Party committee sent him to the Provincial Construction Machinery Factory to visit and study, to increase his knowledge of mechanical technology, and took him from his job to concentrate on innovation. Wang Shunxin, the deputy secretary of the Party committee, would go to Chen Shilin's "innovation shed" whenever he had time to see what difficulties he still had in the trial production and try to solve them for him. After research, the workshop branch released Luo Shaofan and Yang Guoliang, the best carpenters in the workshop's carpentry team, to discuss with him and assist him in the production. The entire bricklaying team where he worked—the Yi Bozong Red Flag Bricklaying Team—unanimously proposed a guarantee to the workshop: We will take over Xiao Chen's work, and we will never let him be preoccupied with two things at the same time. The team also selected six experienced workers to form a technological innovation core group to collectively study and solve many key problems in the trial production of the bricklaying machine.
    Under this kind of concern and encouragement, Chen Shilin launched a tenacious fight against repeated failures. Carpenter Luo Shaofan was also a well-known "innovation enthusiast" in the carpentry team. The two were a perfect match. Whether it was day or night, the clanging of axes and chisels, and the intense debates, filled this temporary "innovation shed" made of felt. The machine was repeatedly disassembled and assembled, and often they were reluctant to let go until late at night.
    After several collective studies and more than ten failures, the bricklaying machine was fitted with a motor and was able to start walking. Chen Shilin hurriedly carried the bricklaying machine to the construction site, installed it on the brick wall, connected the power, and personally fed a few bricks into the machine... But, with a "click," the bricklaying machine was like a child who had just been led to learn to walk, suddenly let go by the person supporting it, and could not move even half a step. The workers who were concerned about the bricklaying machine were all anxious and looked at each other. Chen Shilin's heart was burning like a cat scratching, staring at the machine in a daze....
    Zhou Jiexu, the secretary of the workshop branch, suddenly squeezed out of the crowd and said to Chen Shilin kindly and seriously, "Xiao Chen! No invention is smooth sailing, you must be able to withstand the test of failure." These two simple and ordinary sentences made Chen Shilin sober. He carried the machine back to the "innovation shed" and buried himself in work again.
        Not Afraid of One Hundred and Seven Failures
    More than a month passed, and the problem of not being able to lay bricks was initially resolved. However, another headache followed: the machine could not operate continuously. After several inspections, analyses, and discussions, the core group confirmed the crux of the problem. They believed that the main key was that the chains and gears driving the bricks down were not suitable and needed to be replaced.
    March in Guizhou is a time of chilly spring. Chen Shilin braved the cold and almost ran through all the bicycle shops and waste product stores in Guiyang City. He forgot the cold and the fatigue. One day, he finally found the treasure he was looking for in a bicycle repair shop near Daxi Gate. He took out a ruler to measure it, it was just the right size. Chen Shilin quickly told the shop assistant about their trial production of the bricklaying machine and asked to buy all these parts. After listening to his explanation, the shop assistant not only sold him these parts, but also said, "If you lack any parts in the future, just come, we will definitely find a way for you."
    He had encountered such enthusiastic help in many units. With these concerns and support, coupled with his hard work and research, the bricklaying machine he had been thinking about day and night finally achieved initial success after one hundred and seven failures, large and small. Using this bricklaying machine to build walls, the daily bricklaying efficiency was as high as 46,000 bricks or more. Moreover, whether building clear water walls or muddy water walls, it can achieve the same neatness, smoothness, and speed. This year, on the "May Fourth" Youth Day, Chen Shilin won the honorary title of Red Flag Bearer of Youth Socialist Construction.
      "Everything is hard in the beginning." Having passed the difficult first hurdle, Chen Shilin has taken bigger and faster steps towards the broad road of technological innovation and revolution. From April 1, when the bricklaying machine was initially successfully trial-produced, he has been constantly improving the bricklaying machine, and together with all the comrades in the bricklaying team, he has launched a full-scale attack on all manual processes of bricklaying, such as sand screening, ash washing, ash mixing, brick transportation, and loading and hoisting, and has successively created, imitated, jointly created, and improved a series of electric bricklaying machines such as electric sand screening machines, ash washing machines, ash mixing machines, plastering machines, belt conveyors, tower cranes, and simple winches. Pairing these machines into sets and connecting them into a "dragon" has increased the average work efficiency by 25 times, enabling bricklayers, who have relied on manual operation for thousands of years, to achieve "one-stop" mechanized linkage operation. However, Chen Shilin is not satisfied with the existing achievements. In mid-September, when their bricklaying team was transferred to a new construction site to rush for earthwork projects, in the face of the new work, he and all the comrades in the team started working together, creating and imitating earth lifting poles, electric handcarts, automatic unloading hoppers, electric soil conveying slides, and aerial slides and other earth digging, loading, transporting, and unloading machinery in a simple manner, which quickly increased the average work efficiency of the entire team from the initial 1.7 cubic meters to 8.15 cubic meters, becoming a high-efficiency red flag on the entire construction site.

    扔掉砖刀用机器
    本报记者  张之遴
    1959年12月，陈仕林以贵州省第一建筑工程公司推广先进泥工工具能手的身份，担任了全省工业、交通、基本建设系统技术革新、技术革命展览会铺灰器的操作表演和讲解。展览会是一个无限丰富的宝库，琳琅满目的革新机具，摆满了楼上楼下的陈列室。但在泥工革新机具陈列室里，除几张操作示意图和一些表明工效上升状况的统计图表外，展出的实物，只有几部木结构的铺灰器。
    “砌砖能不能用机器呢？”陈仕林想。这问题他已不止想过一次了，这次竟突然增加了不可抗拒的诱惑力，越来越强烈地攫住了他的心。他吃不香，睡不稳。甚至，当他无意中看见一辆吉普车从身旁急驰而过，也会不由自主地幻觉出一部急驶在砌砖线上的砌砖墙机的形象来。
      第一张草图
    创造砌墙机的欲望煎熬着他，他再也无法抑制这种急切的心情了。一天，他壮着胆子找省建筑工程厅的一位工程技术人员，谈出了这个潜伏已久的愿望。那位技术员听完他的叙述后，连连摇着头说：“困难，这是真正的机器呵；你学过机械制造么？”这答复对陈仕林来说，真比他工作没有完成定额，或者在生产竞赛中掉了队还要难受。怎么办！是死了心不搞呢，还是再找别的门路？他困惑地一直转念了好几天。时而想：人家的话也对，按自己的意思，搞出来的砌墙机既要能自动铺灰、砌砖，又要能自动挤浆、刮平……怕真比一台机器还复杂哩，可是自己有什么本事呢，小学不过念了三年。时而又想：不完全对吧！展览馆里有好多新机具，不也是普通工人搞出来的么，难道人家能搞发明创造，我就不能？何况党一再号召我们要破除迷信，解放思想，向技术革新、技术革命要高工效和劳力呢……。想到这里，不久前泥工队组织高工效对手赛的情景，又在他脑际萦回……。
    当时，他由于认真地、积极地学习了外地泥工先进经验，比较熟练地掌握了铺灰器的操作，一马当先，使日砌砖工效从三千六百块左右逐渐提高到了一万零九十六块。陈仕林该有多高兴呵！满想再鼓一把劲，突破一万一千块大关。但是，那怕使尽了九牛二虎之力，也难再把工效提高一步。
    不从技术革新、技术革命找出路，想多砌一块砖多么不容易呵。他不再犹豫了，跑去找原来在一个公司工作过的一位老工长商量。老工长热情地鼓励他：
  “对！应该革掉砖刀、灰桶的命。”并建议他好好向那位技术员作作思想动员工作，争取他的帮助，把草图搞出来。
    陈仕林心里有了底，前前后后想了一大堆要制砌墙机的理由，准备详详细细地和技术员谈谈。那知一开腔就乱了套，只好没头没脑地、直通通地说：“技术员同志，我也明白，搞这样的机器不一定一次两次、三月五月就能成功，但我横了心，是非搞不可的；我只请你按我的意思帮我画一张草图，你画一张图也不等于失败呵。”
    技术员被这位顽强的青年说服了。两人坐下来，一个谈，一个画，画出了第一张砌墙机草图。这时，时间已迅速跨进了六十年代的第一个春天。
          当困难压头的时候
    真正的困难开始了。什么马达、皮带、链条、齿轮……一大堆的材料和铸件，需要一样一样去寻找、加工。材料齐备后，又得一样一样地装配、试验。陈 仕林不懂木工活，不懂机械工艺，不懂电，不懂……总之，许许多多新东西，要他去摸索、熟悉和掌握。
    这时，公司党委、工段支部、泥工队的伙伴，从四面八方向他伸出了热忱的手。党委送他到省建筑机械厂去参观、学习，让他增加一些机械工艺知识，并把他从工作岗位上抽出来，让他集中精力搞革新。党委副书记王顺新，一有空就转到陈仕林的“革新棚”去，看看他试制中还有哪些困难，设法替他解决。工段支部经过研究，把段里木工队技术最好的老师傅罗绍凡、杨国良腾出来和他共同研讨，协助他制作。他所在的泥工队——易伯仲红旗泥工队——的全体泥工，一致向工段提出保证：小陈的工作我们包下来，决不叫他一心挂两头。队里还挑出六个有经验的工人，组成技术革新核心小组，集体钻研、解决砌墙机试制中的许多关键问题。
    陈仕林在这种关切和鼓舞下，同一次又一次的失败展开了顽强的搏斗。木工罗绍凡，在木工队里也是一个鼎鼎有名的“革新迷”。两个在一块正对劲，不论白天黑夜，叮当的斧凿声，激烈的争辩声，塞满了这座临时用牛毛毡搭成的“革新棚”。机器反反复复地卸了又装，装了又卸，常常是夜静更深还舍不得丢手。
    经过了好几次的集体研究和十多次的失败，砌墙机安上马达，能开步走了。陈仕林忙不迭地把砌墙机抱到工地，安上砖墙，接通电源，亲手往机子上喂进几块砖……，那知，“咔喳”一声，砌墙机像刚牵着学走路的孩子，突然被搀扶者一撒手，连半步也不能动弹。关切砌墙机的工人们，一个个急得面面相觑。陈仕林的心里，像猫抓火燎一样，盯着机器直发怔……。
    工段支部书记周介修蓦地从人缝里挤了出来，对着陈仕林亲切而又严肃地说：“小陈！任何发明创造都不是一帆风顺的，你要经得起失败的考验。”这两句简单而又平凡的话，使陈仕林清醒过来。他抱着机器回到“革新棚”，又埋头干了起来。
        不怕一百零七次失败
    时间过去了一月多，不能下砖的问题算是初步得到了解决。可是，接踵而来的，又是另一个令人头疼的问题：机器不能连续操作。核心小组经过几次检验、分析和讨论，肯定了毛病的症结。认为主要关键是带动下砖的链条和齿轮不合适，需要掉换。
    3月的贵州，正是春寒料峭的时候。陈仕林冒着寒冷，几乎跑遍了全贵阳市的自行车行和废品经销店。忘了冷，也忘了疲累。一天，终于在大西门附近的一家自行车修理店里，发现了自己渴求的宝贝。他掏出尺子一量，不大不小，正合适。陈仕林连忙把他们试制砌墙机的事，向营业员说了个大概，请求把这套零件全卖给他，营业员听了他的说明以后，不仅把这套零件卖给了他，并说：“今后再缺啥零件，尽管来，我们一定替你想办法。”
    像这样热情的援助，在多少单位都碰到过。凭着这些关怀和支援，加上自己的刻苦钻研，他日夜想念的砌墙机，终于在经过大小一百零七次的失败之后，获得初步成功。使用这种砌墙机砌墙，日砌砖工效高达四万六千块以上。而且，不论砌清水墙或浑水墙，都能作到同样的整齐、光洁和快速。今年“五四”青年节，陈仕林获得了青年社会主义建设红旗手的光荣称号。
      “万事开头难”。闯过了艰难的第一关的陈仕林，向着技术革新、技术革命的广阔道路，迈开了更大更快的步子。从4月1日砌墙机初步试制成功到现在，他一边不断地改进砌墙机，一边和泥工队的全体同志一起，向泥工的筛砂、洗灰、合灰、运砖、装吊等各个手工工序发起全面进攻，先后创制、仿制、合制和改进了电动筛砂机、洗灰机、合灰机、粉墙机、皮带运输机、塔式吊车和简易卷扬机等一系列的电动泥工机具。将这些机具配成套，联成“龙”，平均提高工效二十五倍，使千百年来都靠手工操作的泥工，实现了“一条龙”机械化联动线作业。然而，陈仕林并不满足于现有的成就。9月中旬，当他们泥工队调到新的工地突击土方工程时，在新的工作面前，他又和全队同志一齐动手，因陋就简地创制、仿造了土吊杆、电动手车、自动卸土吊斗、电动运土滑板和空中滑道等挖、装、运、卸土机械，使全队平均工效很快地由最初的一点七方提高到八点十五方，成了全工地一面高工效红旗。（附图片）
