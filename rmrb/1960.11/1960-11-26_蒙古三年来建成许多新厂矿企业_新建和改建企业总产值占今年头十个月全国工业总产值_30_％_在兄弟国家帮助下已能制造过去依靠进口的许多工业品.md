Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 25th. Zhugder, Director of the Industry Department of the Mongolian State Planning Commission, told reporters today that Mongolia has built, renovated, and expanded a large number of new factories and mines in the past three years. Many industrial products that Mongolia could not manufacture or relied on imports in the past can now be manufactured by itself and can meet the needs of the country.

He said that in the past three years, the state's investment in industrial construction has been equivalent to about 1.5 times the total investment in this area during the Second Five-Year Plan period (1953-1957). In the past three years, with the help of fraternal countries, more than 30 large-scale factories and mines have been newly built and put into production in Mongolia, including the Nalaihe Coal Mine with an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal, the Central Power Station, the Sukhbaatar Thermal Power Station, the Paper Mill, the Woolen Textile Factory, and the Leather Shoe Factory. The total output value of these newly built and renovated factories and mines accounts for 30% of the national industrial output value in the first ten months of this year. Now, Mongolia's power generation capacity has increased to more than twice that of three years ago; the flour mills that have been built and are under construction can meet the country's needs for flour after they are put into production.

Zhugder said that Mongolia is also currently building more than ten large-scale factories and mines, such as a soft sheep leather factory with an annual output of more than 200,000 pieces of soft sheep leather, and a housing assembly plant with an annual output of 70,000 square meters of residential area, which will be put into production next year.

He said that in the past three years, the new factories and mines built in Mongolia have not only been built quickly, but some factories and mines have reached and exceeded their original design capacity shortly after being put into production. With the commissioning of these enterprises, Mongolia can now produce wool fabrics, leather shoes, glass, porcelain, paper, bricks, tiles, wood and other industrial products and building materials that could not be manufactured in the country in the past and had to rely on imports, and many products can now fully meet the needs of the country. This has created good conditions for the future development of Mongolia's industrial production.

Zhugder said that with the development of industrial production, the number of Mongolian technical personnel has also greatly increased. Now, Mongolia has more than 100,000 workers. Many people were originally herdsmen on the grasslands, but now they have become various technical workers. (Attached picture)

    蒙古三年来建成许多新厂矿企业
    新建和改建企业总产值占今年头十个月全国工业总产值30％
    在兄弟国家帮助下已能制造过去依靠进口的许多工业品
    新华社乌兰巴托25日电　蒙古国家计划委员会工业司司长朱格德尔今天接见本社记者时说，三年来，蒙古新建、改建和扩建了大批新的厂矿企业。蒙古原来不能制造或者依靠进口的许多工业品，现在已经能够自己制造，并且能够满足本国的需要。
    他说，最近三年来，国家用于工业建设的投资相当于第二个五年计划期间（1953—1957年）用于这方面的投资总额的一点五倍左右。最近三年间，在兄弟国家的帮助下，蒙古新建成并投入生产的大型厂矿企业中，有年产六十万吨煤的那来河煤矿、中央发电站、苏赫巴托尔热电站、造纸厂、毛纺厂和皮鞋厂等三十多个厂矿企业。这些新建和改建的厂矿企业的生产总值占今年头十个月全国工业生产总值的30％。现在，蒙古的发电设备能力已增加为三年前的二倍以上；已经建成和正在建设的面粉厂投入生产后就可以满足本国人民对面粉的需要。
    朱格德尔说，目前，蒙古还正在建设年产二十多万张软羊皮的软羊皮革厂、年产七万平方米居住面积的房屋的房屋装配联合厂等十多个大型厂矿企业，它们在明年就可以投入生产。
    他说，三年来，蒙古建设的新厂矿企业不仅建设速度快，而且有一些厂矿企业在投入生产后不久便达到和超过了原来的设计能力。随着这些企业的投入生产，蒙古现在已经可以大批生产毛织品、皮鞋、玻璃、瓷器、纸张、砖瓦、木材等过去本国不能制造而要依靠进口的工业品和建筑材料，而且，许多产品也已经可以完全满足本国的需要。这就为今后蒙古工业生产的发展创造了良好的条件。
    朱格德尔说，随着工业生产的发展，蒙古本民族的技术人材也大大增加了。现在，蒙古已经有十多万工人。许多人原来是草原上的牧民，现在已经成为各种技术工人了。（附图片）
