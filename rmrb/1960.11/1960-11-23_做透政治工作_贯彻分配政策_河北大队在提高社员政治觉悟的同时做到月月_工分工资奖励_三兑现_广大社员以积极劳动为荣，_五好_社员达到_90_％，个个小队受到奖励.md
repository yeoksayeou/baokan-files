Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch: The Hebei Brigade Party Branch of Huaicheng People's Commune, Huai'an County, Jiangsu Province, implements the principle of combining political command with material guarantees. While strengthening the Party's leadership and conducting thorough political and ideological work to raise the socialist ideological awareness of the broad masses of members, the brigade also implements monthly wage payments, achieving monthly delivery of "work points, wages, and rewards." This better implements the policy of distribution according to labor and more pay for more work. The broad masses of members are full of political enthusiasm, their labor enthusiasm is high, their drive is growing stronger, and production is getting better and better.

The Hebei Brigade Party Branch, in leading production and various tasks, has always attached importance to first grasping political and ideological work to improve the political and ideological level of cadres and members. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Party Branch Secretary Gao Hanfei and all Party members have consistently persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies, making it regular, popular, and widespread, becoming a model unit for theoretical study in the Huaiyin Special Zone. Brigade cadres study for one hour every day, and Party members and team cadres attend amateur Party schools, generally attending class once every ten days during slack farming seasons and once every half month during busy seasons, studying the Party's relevant policy documents. They also ensure that theory is linked to practice and that theoretical study is closely integrated with current production. For example, in order to better adhere to the "Four Togethers," to do a good job in production and life, and to correctly implement the Party's policies, they studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership," "Concern Ourselves with the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," and "Our Economic Policy." Through study, they continuously improved the cadres' work style and solved key problems in current production and life.

In order to improve the political and ideological level of the broad masses of members, eight political evening schools were established, based on production teams. The adult members of the entire brigade generally attend these schools. They hold a policy lecture once a month using the fields or threshing grounds, with Party branch committee members responsible for lecturing, combining current production to explain to the members the policies of distribution according to labor, more pay for more work, and "three guarantees and one reward." This not only enables members to understand the relationship between collective interests and individual interests, between immediate interests and long-term interests, but also to understand and master the specific methods of implementing these policies, turning the Party's policies into the conscious actions of the masses. In the three years since the establishment of the People's Commune, the brigade's work evaluation and work point recording system and the "three guarantees and one reward" have been implemented very well, production is orderly, and the political and production enthusiasm of the masses is very full.

While adhering to political command and strengthening political and ideological work, the brigade, starting in July this year, changed the original method of distribution of two pre-distributions and one final year-end distribution to monthly wage payments, achieving monthly delivery of "work points, wages, and rewards." Each production team adheres to daily work evaluation and work point recording, summarizes once every five days, and announces once a month, so that members are clear about the work points they have earned. On the basis of doing a good job in work evaluation and work point recording, wages are paid monthly according to the actual labor work points of each person, with more pay for more work. When paying wages each month, production teams and members who have outstandingly completed their production tasks and exceeded their labor quotas are given spiritual encouragement and a certain amount of cash rewards. A member meeting is held to announce the list of work points, wages, and rewards, while delivering them, and further arrangements are made for production in the next month.

In order to ensure sufficient cash to pay wages monthly, cadres and masses work together to tap the potential for increased production, intercropping an appropriate amount of commercial cash crops in the fields of more than 1,000 mu of grain crops to increase income. At the same time, through collective efforts, they vigorously developed three types of year-round sideline occupations such as pig raising, gardening, and weaving, earning more than 22,000 yuan from January to October.

While delivering "work points, wages, and rewards" monthly, in conjunction with checking and summarizing production, advanced production teams and "Five-Good" members are evaluated. "Five-Good" members are those who are good in political thought, good in observing discipline, good in helping each other, good in production and labor, and good in caring for collective interests. Members are encouraged politically, and the red banner evaluation competition of learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing between teams and between people is launched enthusiastically. This further tightly combines political command with material guarantees, continuously improving the communist consciousness and collectivist ideology of the members. Therefore, the members all take pride in active labor and in being a "Five-Good" member, consciously doing a good job in production and striving to be a "Five-Good" member. The number of "Five-Good" members in the entire brigade increased from more than 500 before July to more than 720, accounting for 90% of the number of adult members. During the autumn planting, Qian Shaozuo, a member of the Second Production Team, repeatedly tilled the land three times, saying: "We are distributed according to labor, so we must do a good job of labor. If we don't do a good job of labor and just take a monthly wage, we will feel uneasy. Now that we have the monthly three deliveries, we must also have three realities in terms of the progress, quality, and work points of agricultural work, and do a good job of production." His quota for October was fifteen workdays, but he actually worked thirty-one workdays. Because he worked well, had good political thought, and cared about collective interests, he was rated as a "Five-Good" member by the members.

Because the Hebei Brigade Party Branch adheres to the principle of combining political command and material guarantees, the members of the entire brigade are becoming more and more motivated, production is getting better and better, and they have always maintained a strong fighting will. Under the slogan of "Everyone Exceeds the Plan, Every Item Exceeds the Plan, Every Month Exceeds the Plan," since July, more than 720 people in the entire brigade, accounting for more than 90%, have exceeded the labor quota by 5% to 20% respectively. Therefore, the six hundred mu of wheat this year was sown five days earlier than last year, the sown area was expanded by more than one hundred mu compared with last year, and the sowing quality was also better than in previous years. In the past, the transportation of materials here was all done by shoulder carrying, and the members self-reliantly manufactured more than two hundred rubber-wheeled carts, increasing work efficiency by more than five times. Because the members' labor enthusiasm is high and everyone is striving for high yields, every team has overproduced this year and all have received overproduction rewards. While agricultural production has increased, diversified operations have been vigorously developed. On the basis of the original three year-round projects of sideline production, with the large-scale processing of agricultural and sideline products as the main focus, ten new projects have been developed. The output value in October reached more than 5,000 yuan, an increase of more than double the average monthly output value last year.

The more motivated the members are, the more the brigade party branch cares about the lives of the masses, comprehensively doing a good job of the members' lives with the aim of running the public canteen well. All eleven canteens in the brigade have a solid foundation, have established vegetable bases, and also raise more than 30 pigs, more than 200 chickens and ducks, as well as varying numbers of rabbits, sheep, and fish. Now everyone can eat three catties of vegetables every day on average, and the meals are diversified, and the canteen is getting better and better. As the grain is weighed and put into the warehouse, the entire brigade's members' rations have been arranged according to households and people until the new grain is harvested next year, implementing a system of quantitative assessment per person, targets to households, grain to the hall, eating with tickets, and saving for oneself, so that everyone plans grain use and saves grain use. All eight nurseries in the brigade are also doing very well. At the end of the autumn harvest, the brigade also organized special personnel to repair houses for the members and do a good job of winter warmth preservation. Because the brigade has done a good job of the mass life and welfare centered on the canteen, it was recently rated as one of the collective red banner units for life welfare in the county.

    做透政治工作　贯彻分配政策
    河北大队在提高社员政治觉悟的同时做到月月“工分工资奖励”三兑现  广大社员以积极劳动为荣，“五好”社员达到90％，个个小队受到奖励
    新华社南京电　江苏省淮安县淮城人民公社河北大队党支部执行政治挂帅和物质保证相结合的原则，在加强党的领导，深入地进行政治思想工作，提高广大社员社会主义思想觉悟的同时，实行按月发工资，做到月月“工分、工资、奖励”三兑现，更好地贯彻了按劳分配和多劳多得的政策，广大社员政治情绪饱满，劳动热情高涨，干劲越来越足，生产越搞越好。
    河北大队党支部在领导生产和各项工作中，一向重视首先抓政治思想工作，提高干部社员的政治思想水平。从1958年大跃进以来，党支部书记高汉飞和全体党员一直坚持学习毛主席著作和党的方针政策，作到了经常化、通俗化、普遍化，成为淮阴专区理论学习的标兵单位。大队干部都做到每天学习一小时，党员和小队干部都进业余党校，一般是农闲时每十天上课一次，大忙时每半月上课一次，学习党的有关政策文件，并且做到理论联系实际，理论学习与当前的生产紧密结合。例如，为了更好地坚持“四同”，搞好生产和生活，正确地贯彻党的方针政策，他们分别学习了毛主席“关于领导方法的若干问题”、“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”和“我们的经济政策”等文章，通过学习，不断地改进了干部的作风，解决了当前生产和生活中的关键问题。
    为了提高广大社员的政治思想水平，以生产小队为单位设立了八个政治业余学校，全大队的成年社员一般都进业余政治学校学习，他们利用田头或场头每月举行一次政策讲座，由党支部委员分工负责讲课，结合当前生产向社员讲解按劳分配、多劳多得和“三包一奖”等政策。这样做不仅使社员懂得集体利益和个人利益的关系，眼前利益和长远利益的关系，而且了解和掌握贯彻这些政策的具体方法，把党的政策变成了群众的自觉行动。人民公社成立来的三年中，这个大队的评工记分制度和“三包一奖”一直执行得很好，生产有条不紊，群众的政治和生产情绪非常饱满。
    在坚持政治挂帅，加强政治思想工作的同时，这个大队从今年7月起将原来的一年两次预分和一次年终决分的分配方法，改为按月发工资，做到月月“工分、工资、奖励”三兑现。各个生产小队都坚持天天评工记分，每五天小结一次，每个月公布一次，社员们对自己做的工分，个个心中有数。在做好评工记分的基础上，按照各人实做的劳动工分，月月发工资，多劳多得。在每月发工资的时候，对于出色地完成生产任务、超过劳动定额的生产小队和社员，都给予精神鼓励和一定的现金奖励，并召开社员大会，公布工分、工资和奖励名单，一面兑现，一面进一步安排下月生产。
    为了保证有充裕的现金按月发工资，干部群众一起动手，大挖增产潜力，在一千多亩粮食作物的田里套种适当数量的商品性的经济作物，增加收入。同时，群策群力大力发展了养猪、种园林、编织等三种常年副业，从1月到10月已经收入了两万二千多元。
    在月月“工分、工资、奖励”三兑现的同时，结合检查总结生产，评比先进生产小队，评比政治思想好、遵守纪律好、相互帮助好、生产劳动好、关心集体利益好的“五好”社员，从政治上鼓励社员，热烈地开展了队与队、人与人之间的学、赶、帮、超的红旗评比竞赛。这样，更使政治挂帅和物质保证紧密结合起来，不断提高社员的共产主义觉悟和集体主义思想。因此，社员们都以积极劳动为荣，以“五好”社员为荣，自觉的搞好生产，争做“五好”社员。全大队的“五好”社员从7月以前的五百多名增加到七百二十多名，占成年社员数的90％。在秋种中，第二生产小队社员钱少佐整地时，反复整了三次，他说：“我们按劳分配，就要劳动好，要是劳动不好，光拿月工资，心里也不安，现在月月三兑现，我们也要来个农活进度、质量、工分三实在，搞好生产。”他10月份的定额是十五个劳动日，结果实做了三十一个劳动日。由于他劳动好、政治思想好，又关心集体利益，被社员们评为“五好”社员。
    河北大队党支部由于坚持政治挂帅和物质保证相结合的原则，全大队的社员干劲越来越大，生产越搞越好，始终保持着旺盛的战斗意志。在“人人超计划，项项超计划，月月超计划”的口号下，全大队从7月份以来有七百二十多人即占90％以上的社员，分别超过劳动定额5％到20％。因此，今年六百多亩三麦比去年提早五天播种结束，播种面积比去年扩大一百多亩，播种质量也比往年好。过去这里运输物资都是肩抬担挑，社员们自力更生地制造了二百多部胶轮车，提高工效五倍以上。由于社员们劳动热情高涨，个个争高产，今年个个小队超产，全部受到超产奖励。在农业生产增产的同时，大力发展了多种经营。副业生产在原来常年的三种项目的基础上，又以大搞农副产品加工为主，新发展了十种项目，10月份产值达到五千余元，比去年平均月产值增加一倍以上。
    社员干劲越大，大队党支部越是关心群众生活，以办好公共食堂为中心，全面搞好社员生活。全大队十一个食堂都有雄厚的家底，建立了蔬菜基地，还养猪三十多头、养鸡鸭二百多只，以及数量不等的兔、羊和鱼。现在平均每人每天都可以吃到三斤蔬菜，并做到饭菜多样化，食堂越办越好。随着粮食过秤入仓，全大队社员口粮已按户按人安排到明年接上新粮，实行以人定量、指标到户、粮食到堂、凭票吃饭、节约归己的制度，人人计划用粮、节约用粮。全大队八个托儿所也办得很好。秋收刚结束时，大队还组织专人替社员修理了房屋，做好过冬保暖工作。这个大队由于办好以食堂为中心的群众生活福利，最近被评为全县生活福利的集体红旗单位之一。
