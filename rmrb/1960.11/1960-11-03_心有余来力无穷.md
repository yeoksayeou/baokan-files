With Abundant Heart, Strength is Limitless
Qian Daoyuan, Secretary of the General Party Branch of Jiangyang Machine Tool Factory

In the current mass movement where all sectors of society are broadly supporting agriculture, the vast majority of our factory's employees have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call with practical actions, regarding industrial support for agriculture as a supremely glorious task. However, there are also a very few employees who verbally shout about how important agriculture is, but are not so proactive in their actual actions. When faced with difficult support tasks, they emphasize various difficulties, saying things like "My heart is willing, but my strength is insufficient!"

"Heart" refers to thought, generally speaking of determination, confidence, and ambition; "Strength" refers to action, generally speaking of energy, power, and ability. Heart and strength, thought and action, are opposing; heart is not strength; but they are also unified, closely linked, and mutually promoting. If there is heart, there will be strength. All those who truly have "abundant heart" will have lofty ambitions, determination, and confidence. Even if their strength is temporarily insufficient, they will try every possible means to work hard, and therefore will have "limitless strength" and soaring enthusiasm. Those who lack "strength," who lack enthusiasm and fail to take action, are likely lacking this "heart" altogether, let alone having an "abundant heart." Therefore, when some comrades say that their "heart is willing, but their strength is insufficient," they really need to examine their "heart" -- is it that they have no such "heart" in the first place, or that their "heart is not abundant"?

There is such an incident. In February of this year, our factory accepted the production task of three hundred and thirty-four water pumps, and it had to be completed in a crash program within two months. A few comrades said: "Last year, it took two months to produce one hundred and fifty water pumps. This year, without adding a single worker or a single lathe, the task is doubled. How can it be completed?" So, they said with a wry smile, "My heart is willing, but my strength is insufficient!" Given our factory's technology, equipment, and labor force at the time, it was not entirely without basis to say that "strength was insufficient." However, the determination of the majority of comrades to support agriculture was as firm as iron, and everyone was filled with ambition and high morale, so since the "heart" was "abundant," there was no need to worry about "insufficient strength." They were determined to work hard and skillfully, and in just seven days, they achieved "five transformations" throughout the factory (transportation becoming rail-based, feeding becoming automated, drilling machines becoming multi-headed, cutting becoming high-speed, and parts becoming standardized), which increased production efficiency by more than two times at once, thereby enabling the majority of the three hundred and thirty-four water pumps to be shipped ahead of schedule, gloriously completing the task. They said, "The thought of supporting agriculture is deeply rooted, technological innovation soars to the sky, with abundant heart, strength is limitless, no matter how many tasks there are, they can be completed." Looking at those comrades who were always stuck in the dead end of "insufficient strength," the situation was completely different. They did not see the lofty ambitions of the broad masses, did not believe that the broad masses had endless power, and did not actively innovate and create. In the face of the task of supporting agriculture, they showed clumsiness and lack of enthusiasm. In order to cover up this embarrassment, they had to use "My heart is willing, but my strength is insufficient" as a self-deprecating excuse. The root cause of this is nothing more than not truly establishing the determination and ambition to wholeheartedly support agriculture. Without this "heart," where does this "strength" come from? If the "heart" is "not abundant," how can the "strength" be "sufficient"?

Facts prove: those with an "abundant heart" are likely to have "limitless strength"; those with a "heart not abundant" will certainly have "insufficient strength." In the long-term process of supporting agricultural technology, we must thoroughly overcome the state of "heart not abundant," always maintain the state of "abundant heart," and give full play to our unlimited potential to ensure the sustained leap forward in agricultural production.

    心有余来力无穷
    中共江阳机床厂总支书记　钱导元
    在当前各行各业广泛支援农业的群众运动中，我们厂里绝大部分职工同志都以实际行动热烈响应党的号召，把工业支援农业看作一件无尚光荣的任务。可是也有极少数职工同志，在口头上也喊农业是如何重要，但在实际行动中却不是那么积极主动。一碰到艰巨的支援任务，他们就强调这样那样的困难，说什么“心有余力不足啊”！
    “心”是指思想，一般讲的是决心、信心、雄心；“力”是指行动，一般讲的是劲头、力量、能力。心与力，思想与行动，是对立的，心并不是力；但它们又是统一的，两者密切联系，互相促进，有心就会有力。凡是真正“心有余”的，就会有雄心壮志，有决心信心，虽然一时力量不足，也会千方百计去努力，因而就会是“力大无穷”，干劲冲天；凡是“力不足”的，劲头不足，行动不起来，很可能是由于根本没有此心，更说不上“心有余”了。所以，当有些同志说自己“心有余力不足”的时候，他们就很有必要检查检查自己的“心”，——是本无此“心”呢，还是“心无余”？
    有这样一件事。今年2月份，我们厂接受了三百三十四台水泵的生产任务，而且必须在两个月内突击完成。少数同志说：“去年生产一百五十台水泵，就花了两个月，今年没增一个劳动力，没添一部车床，任务加一倍，哪里完得成？”于是，他们就苦笑着说：“心有余力不足啊！”按当时我们厂的技术、设备、劳动力来讲，说“力不足”并不是绝对没有根据。但是，大多数同志支援农业的决心坚如铁石，个个雄心百倍，斗志昂扬，所以“心”既有“余”，就不愁“力不足”了。他们下定决心，苦干加巧干，在短短七天内，就使全厂实现了“五化”（运输轨道化、加料自动化、钻床多头化、切削高速化、部件标准化），把生产效率一下子提高了两倍多，从而使三百三十四台水泵大部提前出厂，光荣地完成了任务。他们说：“支援农业思想根扎牢，技术革新翻天高，心有余来力无穷，任务再多也完成得了。”再看那些老是钻在“力不足”牛角尖里的同志，情形就完全两样了。他们看不到广大群众的雄心壮志，不相信广大群众有无穷力量，更不积极去革新创造，在支援农业任务面前，表现了呆手呆脚，干劲不足。为了掩饰这种窘相，他们只好拿“心有余力不足”来自我解嘲。究其根源，无非是没有真正确立全心全意支援农业的决心和雄心。既无此“心”，又何来此“力”？“心”既“无余”，“力”又何“足”？
    事实证明：凡是“心有余”的，就可能“力无穷”；凡是“心无余”的，就一定“力不足”。在持久的支援农业技术的过程中，我们要彻底克服“心无余”的状态，永远保持“心有余”的状态，为保证农业生产的持续跃进发挥自己的无限潜力。
