    Planting Green Manure in High Mountains
    In order to fully utilize mountainous land, expand the multiple cropping area, and increase grain production, the Fengcun Production Team of our Dajing Commune decided to plant green manure crops on a large scale in mountainous areas.
    Initially, some people believed that green manure could be planted in low mountains and near mountains, but not in high mountains and remote mountains, and even if it was planted, it would not yield a good harvest. The Party branch of the production team then raised the question of "Can green manure be planted in high mountains and remote mountains?" and organized a discussion among all team members. At the discussion, sixty-two-year-old farmer Feng Shiyi said, "Last year, our Tenth Team planted seven mu of green manure on 'Mantou Mountain,' the highest mountain in the entire production team. We sowed the seeds ten days before 'Start of Winter'. When the weather turned cold, the green manure seedlings grew to more than five inches tall. With careful cultivation, we achieved an average yield of more than 9,200 jin of fresh grass per mu." Then, team leader Feng Fangzhong also shared the experience of their team last year in burning grass and wood ash on the spot in remote mountains to solve the problem of fertilizer needed for the green manure fields.
    Through heated discussion, the ideological concerns of the team members were dispelled, and their enthusiasm was increased. Everyone unanimously agreed to plant green manure on all 413 mu of mountainous land in the team. The next day, more than 150 team members carried plows and seeds up the mountain, and planted 48 mu of green manure in one day of hard work.

### 高山种绿肥

    高山种绿肥
    我们大荆公社冯村生产队为了充分利用山地扩大复种面积，多多增产粮食，全队决定在山地上大种绿肥。
    开始，有人认为低山、近山还可以种，高山、远山不能种，就是种了也不会有好的收成。生产队党支部就出了个“高山、远山能不能种绿肥”的题目，组织全队社员讨论。在讨论会上，六十二岁的老农冯士义说：“去年我们第十小队在全生产队最高的‘馒头山’上种了七亩绿肥，‘立冬’前十天播的种，到天气转冷时，绿肥苗长到五寸多高，加上精心培育，结果获得平均亩产鲜草九千二百多斤的收成。接着，小队长冯方忠也介绍了他们小队去年在远山上就地烧草木灰，解决了绿肥田所需肥料的经验。
    通过热烈的讨论，解除了社员的思想顾虑，添了干劲，大家一致同意在全队四百一十三亩山地上种植绿肥。第二天，全队一百五十多个社员扛着犁带着种子上了山，大干一天就种了绿肥四十八亩。
