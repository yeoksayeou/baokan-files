    Opposing the Enslavement by U.S. Imperialism and the Rule of the Reactionary Regime
    Guatemala Erupts in Large-Scale Anti-Government Armed Actions
    Residents of the Capital Demonstrate in Support of the Just Actions of the Anti-Government Forces, Demanding the Resignation of Dictator Ydígoras
    Anti-Government Forces Have Controlled Some Areas in the East, Continuing to Heroically Repel the Government Army's Frenzied Offensive
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from Guatemala City: Guatemala, where a storm of resistance has been brewing for a long time under the enslavement of U.S. imperialism and the rule of the pro-U.S. anti-people regime, erupted in large-scale anti-government armed actions on the 13th. Despite the Ydígoras government dispatching large numbers of troops, paratroopers, and aircraft equipped with rockets to suppress it, this armed resistance is currently ongoing.
    News reports that the anti-government armed action, initiated by two colonels and one captain of the Guatemalan army, first broke out in Puerto Barrios, an important port facing the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast of Guatemala, and in Zacapa, another important city in the east. Subsequently, it gradually expanded to other areas in the eastern part of the country. According to a communiqué issued by the Ydígoras government, the initial number of armed personnel launching the resistance reached several hundred. After fierce fighting, they occupied Puerto Barrios, a major transshipment port controlled by the United Fruit Company of the United States, and the radio station in Matias de Gálvez, near Puerto Barrios, and once occupied the city of Zacapa. The news said that army units in some military strongholds in eastern Guatemala joined this military action after the armed struggle was launched.
    At the same time, according to a United Press International dispatch from Guatemala City, hundreds of soldiers in the capital, Guatemala City, also staged a mutiny and attacked the Guatemalan Army Headquarters. The mutineers seized some tanks, trucks, and weapons and ammunition during the battle, and then rushed to the eastern region where the initial action was launched. Many local garrisons were conscripted to join the force.
    After the incident, the Ydígoras government immediately dispatched 3,000 troops to the eastern region to suppress the rebellion, and dispatched a large number of U.S.-supplied B-26 bombers and other types of aircraft equipped with rockets to frantically bomb Puerto Barrios, Zacapa, and the military bases and strongholds occupied by the rebel troops in the eastern region. The Ydígoras government issued a 30-day martial law order throughout Guatemala that day, and immediately launched a nationwide search for patriotic people. Currently, a strict curfew is in effect in Guatemala City, gatherings of more than four people are prohibited, and all activities of all political parties are also prohibited.
    Regardless of the fact that Guatemalan President Ydígoras is personally leading government troops to continue the frantic suppression of the anti-government forces, the military operations of these anti-government forces are still ongoing. According to Latin American News Agency reports, anti-government forces still control some areas in eastern Guatemala, including Puerto Barrios. A communiqué issued by the Ydígoras government on the 15th admitted that armed elements are still active in the Puerto Barrios and Zacapa areas, and a group of anti-government armed personnel have entered the mountainous area between the two cities.
    This incident in Guatemala is the result of the Guatemalan people's opposition to the United States and the Ydígoras government's implementation of policies that sell out national interests. Since the United States orchestrated the armed overthrow of the democratic government of Guatemala in 1954, the country has been mired in a deep political and economic crisis. The victory of the Cuban revolution and the cruel rule of the United Fruit Company of the United States have educated the Guatemalan people, both positively and negatively. Both the democratic class and some factions in the right-wing groups intend to carry out changes.
    The Ydígoras government's practice of providing Guatemalan territory as a military training and invasion base for Cuba has put the Guatemalan army and people in a dangerous situation, and the recent ouster of Salvadoran dictator Lemus, who had signed an anti-communist treaty with Ydígoras, has triggered a profound reaction in Guatemala.
    According to reports, on the evening of the 15th, residents of Guatemala City held another demonstration demanding the resignation of dictator Ydígoras and declaring their support for the just actions of the anti-government forces.

### 反对美帝国主义的奴役和反动政权的统治  危地马拉爆发大规模反政府武装行动

    反对美帝国主义的奴役和反动政权的统治
    危地马拉爆发大规模反政府武装行动
    首都居民示威支持反政府军的正义行动要求伊迪戈拉斯独裁者辞职
    反政府军已控制东部一些地区继续英勇反击政府军的疯狂进攻
    据新华社16日讯　危地马拉城消息：在美帝国主义的奴役和亲美反人民政权统治下长期酝酿着反抗风暴的危地马拉，13日爆发了大规模的反政府武装行动。尽管伊迪戈拉斯政府出动大批军队、伞兵以及装备有火箭的飞机进行镇压，这次武装反抗行动目前仍在坚持中。
    消息报道，这次在危地马拉军队的两名上校和一名上尉率领下发起的反政府的武装行动，首先是在危地马拉东海岸面临大西洋的重要港口巴利俄港和东部的另一个重要城市萨卡柏爆发的，随后，它逐渐扩展到这个国家东部的其他一些地区。据伊迪戈拉斯政府发表的公报透露，最初发动反抗的武装人员为数达几百人，他们经过激烈战斗，占领了由美国联合果品公司控制的主要转运港口——巴利俄港和巴利俄港附近的马蒂亚斯加尔维斯港的电台，并且一度占领萨卡柏城。消息说，危地马拉东部地区一些军事要塞中的陆军部队在武装斗争发动后，纷纷参加了这一军事行动。
    与此同时，据合众国际社从危地马拉城发出的一条消息说，在首都危地马拉城，几百名军队也举行暴动，袭击了危地马拉陆军总部。这批举行暴动人员在这次战斗中缴获了一些坦克、卡车以及武器和弹药，然后冲向首先发动的东部地区。有许多当地的驻军被征集参加了这支队伍。
    在事件发生以后，伊迪戈拉斯政府立即出动三千名军队，驰往东部地区进行镇压，并且出动大批美国提供的B—26型轰炸机和装备着火箭的其它类型飞机，疯狂轰炸了巴利俄港、萨卡柏城和暴动军队在东部地区占领的军事基地和据点。伊迪戈拉斯政府在当天下令在危地马拉全国戒严三十天，并且立即在全国范围内搜捕爱国人民。目前，危地马拉城实行着严格的宵禁，四人以上的集会遭到禁止，所有政党的一切活动也都遭到禁止。
    不管危地马拉总统伊迪戈拉斯正在亲自率领政府军队，继续对反政府军进行疯狂镇压，这批反政府军队的军事行动仍在坚持中。据拉丁美洲通讯社消息，反政府军仍然控制着危地马拉东部的一些地区，其中包括巴利俄港。伊迪戈拉斯政府15日发表的公报承认：在巴利俄港和萨卡柏城地区，武装分子仍然活跃，一批反政府武装人员已经进入了这两个城市之间的山区。
    在危地马拉发生的这次事件是危地马拉人民反对美国、反对伊迪戈拉斯政府执行出卖民族利益的政策的结果。在1954年美国策划武装颠复危地马拉民主政府以后，这个国家一直陷在深重的政治和经济危机之中。古巴革命胜利和美国联合果品公司的残酷统治从正面和反面教育着危地马拉人民。无论是民主阶层还是右翼集团中的一些派别，都有进行变革的打算。
    伊迪戈拉斯政府把危地马拉领土提供作军事训练和侵略古巴基地的作法，使危地马拉军队和人民面临危险局势，而曾经同伊迪戈拉斯签订反共条约的萨尔瓦多独裁者莱穆斯不久前被赶下台，又在危地马拉国内引起深刻的反应。
    据报道，15日晚上，危地马拉城的居民又举行示威，要求伊迪戈拉斯独裁者辞职，并且宣布支持反政府军的正义行动。
