(This article is) transmitted by our Changchun correspondent on the 26th. Jilin Huadian County's Badaohezi People's Commune adheres to the three-level ownership system based on the production team (called the management area in this commune), promoting the overall development of the commune's economic and production undertakings at all levels.

In order to ensure that the management area fully exercises its due economic authority in organizing production, capital construction, and financial management, the commune has consistently adhered to the "Three Guarantees" and "One Unification" in its management and operation. The so-called "Three Guarantees" are: guaranteeing the basic ownership of labor force and means of production by the management area; guaranteeing the management area's right to manage and operate various productions; and guaranteeing the management area's right to unified distribution. "One Unification" means that the commune implements unified leadership in accordance with the Party's policies and organizes the commune's production in a unified manner in accordance with the state plan. In the process of implementing the "Three Guarantees" and "One Unification," the commune's production plans, crop layouts, and production increase measures for the management area are first discussed from the bottom up by the commune members' congress or the commune members' representative congress, with only suggestions put forward to balance the commune's production plan according to the state plan and local conditions. The Badaohezi Management Area originally planned to plant seventy hectares of soybeans. The commune foresaw that this could only complete the task of selling soybeans to the state and would not have the capacity to take care of the needs of the commune members, so it suggested that the management area plant eighty hectares of soybeans. As a result, it completed the state plan and met the needs of the commune members.

Based on the principle of three-level ownership and separate accounting, the commune rationally handled the distribution authority. Most of the public accumulation fund deducted from the distribution is retained for use by the management area. The commune deducts even less or no money from poor management areas. In dealing with the distribution of income from community joint ventures, the commune paid special attention to giving the management area more benefits and tried to increase the share of distribution for commune members. For example, in the community-run forest farm, each management area, in addition to investing half of the required manpower, the commune is responsible for all expenses such as investment, equipment, and payment of forest cultivation fees to the state, and the commune distributes a certain percentage of the total income to the management area.

The main methods of Badaohezi Commune to support the development of the management area's economy are:

　　(1) The management area should resolutely manage what it can manage. Not only should a part of the community-run enterprises suitable for the management area to operate be resolutely delegated to the management area, but also provide financial, material and technical assistance. Over the past year, the commune has extracted 130,000 yuan from the accumulation of community-run enterprises to help the management area develop production. Community-run industries have helped the management area establish twelve factories of various sizes. The commune has also helped the management area build four power stations with 80,000 yuan of machinery and equipment, so that 70% of the paddy field crops and 30% of the dry land crops in the entire community are threshed mechanically.

　　(2) If it is suitable for the management area to operate, but one management area is unable to operate it alone, the commune actively plans and organizes joint operation between management areas. This can not only give play to the unified leadership of the commune, but also enable the districts to cooperate closely under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange. The Sifangdianzi Management Area has many lands suitable for planting paddy fields, but due to the lack of water conservancy projects, the water source has not been fully utilized, and the area of paddy fields cannot be expanded. The nearby Xiangyang and Badaohezi Management Areas have insufficient water sources. Therefore, the commune organized these three management areas to jointly build a channel as long as twenty li. As a result, the paddy field area in Sifangdianzi Management Area has expanded from 80 hectares last year to 130 hectares, increasing grain production and income. The other two management areas have also increased production due to sufficient water sources.

　　(3) For those of larger scale that the management area is unable to operate or are not suitable for the management area to operate, the commune will jointly operate with the management area. For example, there are large areas of forest in the Sifangdianzi Management Area. The state stipulates that overly dense, withered, and insect-infested timber belongs to the loggers. It is not only beyond the capacity of one management area to operate this production, but it will also cause excessive income disparities between the districts. Therefore, the commune invested in the establishment of a forest farm, and each management area contributed a part of the manpower to carry out thinning, afforestation, and forest management all year round. The income is shared by the community, which has increased a large amount of income for the management area. There were very few pigs raised here in the past. The management areas urgently requested to establish pig farms, but they lacked funds to buy pigs. The commune invested more than 30,000 yuan to establish twelve pig farms (operated by the management area, with 20% and 80% share of profits), which aroused a climax of pig raising. In more than ten months, the average number of pigs raised per household increased from one and a half to two. Over the past year, the community-run forest farm, pig raising and other three projects alone have increased the income of the management area by more than 150,000 yuan.

　　(4) Help poor management areas catch up with rich management areas. In addition to giving priority to supporting poor management areas economically, the commune also sent a group of outstanding cadres to enrich the leading forces of poor management areas. Each poor management area has the main leading cadres of the commune contracted to help with the work. This year, all four poor management areas and fifteen poor production teams in the commune have removed the label of poverty in terms of production conditions and income levels, and two of the poor management areas have caught up with the rich management areas.

In order to mobilize the production enthusiasm of the production team and the vast number of commune members, each management area also paid attention to protecting the right of use and small part of the ownership of the production team. The labor force, land, draught animals, and farm tools fixed for use in the production team are not arbitrarily transferred by the management area. When teams cooperate, a cooperation contract is generally established in advance. After the cooperation, the method of exchanging labor for labor or paying points (work points) according to work is adopted, so that there is reciprocity and equivalent exchange.

In recent years, the economy of each management area has developed rapidly. If the economic output value of each management area in 1958 is set at 100, then it was 160 in 1959, and it continued to increase in 1960. In accordance with the principle of less deduction and more distribution, although the proportion of public accumulation and remittance has not increased, the absolute amount of public accumulation funds paid by the management area to the commune has increased year by year due to the development of production. Although this year suffered from natural disasters such as waterlogging, pests and diseases, and frost, thanks to the good implementation of policies, the high enthusiasm of the masses, and arduous disaster relief efforts, good harvests were still achieved. In addition to keeping enough food, seeds, and fodder, the grain sold to the state increased by 12% compared with last year. The income from diversified operations of the entire commune increased by 1.6 times compared with last year. In just over ten months, the number of pigs increased by 60%, poultry increased by 50%, and horses, cattle, and sheep also increased respectively. With the development of production, especially the economy of the management area, the income of commune members has greatly increased, and the distribution part this year has increased by about 30% compared with last year.

    桦甸县八道河子公社坚持三级所有制
    加强领导　优先发展队有经济
    各项生产事业全面发展社员收入增加
    本报长春26 日电　吉林桦甸县八道河子人民公社坚持以生产队（该社称管理区）为基础的三级所有制，促使全社各级经济和生产事业获得全面发展。
    为了保证管理区在组织生产、基本建设和财务管理等方面充分行使应有的经济权限，这个公社在经营管理上，一直坚持了“三保”、“一统”。所谓“三保”，是保护管理区对劳动力和生产资料的基本所有权；保护管理区对各项生产的经营管理权；保护管理区统一分配权。“一统”是公社根据党的政策实行统一领导，根据国家计划统一组织全社生产。在执行“三保”、“一统”过程中，公社对管理区的各项生产计划、作物布局和增产措施，都先经由社员大会或社员代表大会自下而上的讨论，只提出建议性的意见，以便根据国家计划和当地情况平衡全社生产计划。八道河子管理区原计划种七十公顷大豆，公社预见到这只能完成向国家交售大豆的任务，而没有余力照顾社员的生活需要，于是建议这个管理区种八十公顷大豆，结果既完成了国家计划，又满足了社员需要。
    本着三级所有，分级核算的原则，这个公社合理地处理了分配权限。从分配中扣留的公积金，大部分留给管理区使用，对穷管理区，公社提成更少或者不提成。在处理社区合营企业收益分配问题上，公社特别注意给管理区以更多实惠，尽量增加社员分配部分。例如社区合营的林场，各管理区除了投入所需人力一半而外，投资、设备和向国家缴纳育林费等一切开销都由公社负责，公社以总收入的一定比例分给管理区。
    八道河子公社扶助管理区发展经济的主要办法是：
      （1）管理区能经营的就坚决由管理区经营。不仅把一部分适合管理区经营的社办企业坚决下放给管理区经营，而且还提供资金、物质和技术帮助。一年来，公社从社营企业积累中抽出十三万元帮助管理区发展生产，社办工业帮助管理区建立了十二个大小工厂，公社还以八万元的机械设备帮助管理区建了四座电站，使全社70％的水田作物和30％的旱田作物用机械脱谷。
      （2）适合管理区经营而一个管理区又无力单独经营的，公社积极筹划，组织管理区之间联合经营。这样既能发挥公社统一领导的作用，又使区与区之间在自愿互利、等价交换的原则下通力协作。四方甸子管理区有许多适宜种水田的土地，但由于缺少水利工程，水源没有充分利用，不能扩种水田。附近的向阳、八道河子管理区却存在水源不足的问题。于是公社就组织这三个管理区联合修筑一条长达二十华里的渠道。这样四方甸子管理区水田面积由去年的八十公顷扩大到一百三十公顷，增产了粮食，增加了收入。其它两个管理区也因有了充足的水源而增产。
      （3）对于规模较大、管理区无力经营或不适合管理区经营的，公社就同管理区联合经营。例如四方甸子管理区一带有大片的森林，国家规定间伐过密的、枯萎和虫蛀的木材归采伐者所有。这项生产，一个管理区经营不但力所不及，而且会造成区与区之间收入差异过大。所以由公社投资建立一处林场，各管理区出一部分人力，常年进行间伐、造林、育林工作，收益由社区共同分成，使管理区增加了一大笔收入。这里过去养猪很少，各管理区迫切要求建立养猪场，但缺乏买猪资金。公社投资三万多元，建立十二个养猪场（由管理区经营，收益二、八分成），从而激起了养猪高潮，十个多月的时间，平均每户养猪由一头半增加到两头。一年来，仅社区合营的林场、养猪等三项就使管理区增加收入达十五万元以上。
    （4）帮助穷管理区赶上富管理区。公社除了在经济上优先支援穷管理区而外，还派了一批优秀干部充实穷管理区领导力量，每个穷管理区都有公社主要领导干部包干帮助工作。今年全社四个穷管理区和十五个穷生产小队，在生产条件和收入水平方面都已摘掉穷帽子，其中有两个穷管理区已经赶上富管理区。
    为了调动生产小队和广大社员的生产积极性，各管理区也注意了保护生产小队的使用权和小部分所有制。固定在生产小队使用的劳动力、土地、耕畜、农具，管理区不随意调用。队与队协作时，一般都事先建立协作合同，协作后采取以工还工或者按工付分（工分）的办法，做到了有来有往，等价交换。
    几年来，各管理区经济突飞猛进。如果以1958年各管理区经济产值共为一百，则1959年为一百六十，1960年继续有增加。各管理区本着少扣多分的原则，尽管公积金扣留和上缴比例没提高，但是由于生产的发展，管理区缴给公社的公积金绝对数额却逐年增加。今年这里虽然遭受了水涝、病虫和霜冻等自然灾害，由于政策执行得好，群众的积极性高，进行了艰巨的抗灾斗争，仍然取得了良好收成。除了留足口粮、种子、饲料粮而外，卖给国家的粮食比去年增加12％。全社多种经营收入比去年增长一点六倍。仅十个多月的时间，猪增加60％、家禽增加50％，马、牛、羊也分别都有增长。随着生产特别是管理区经济的发展，社员收入大大增加，今年分配部分比去年增加30％左右。
