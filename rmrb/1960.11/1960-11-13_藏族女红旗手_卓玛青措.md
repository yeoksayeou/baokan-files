Tibetan Female Red Banner Holder – Zhuoma Qingcuo
By Our Correspondent

    On the Yushu grassland, the Tibetan people always associate the word "grain" with happiness. For many years, Tibetan herdsmen have dreamed of a day when they would no longer have to bow and scrape to the herdowners for a handful of zanba, and could live a life of plenty. Today, only two years after the red banner of the People's Commune was raised on the grassland, the members of the Jieguhongqi People's Commune in Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are not only eating the grain they grow themselves, but are also happily delivering public grain to support the country's socialist construction.

    Whenever she talks about these earth-shaking changes, Zhuoma Qingcuo, the National "March 8th" Red Banner Holder, Deputy Secretary of the Hongqi Commune Party Committee, and Director of the Commune, cannot contain her inner excitement.

    In the autumn of 1958, the first People's Commune in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the Jieguhongqi People's Commune, was born. Zhuoma Qingcuo, a twenty-four-year-old Tibetan female Communist Party member, was elected as the Deputy Director and Director of the Women's Federation. In November, she had the honor of going to Beijing to attend the National Conference of Activists in Socialist Construction for Women. At the meeting, she heard the heroic deeds of women from all fronts and saw the mothers of Liu Hulan and Huang Jiguang, and was even more excited to see our beloved great leader Chairman Mao! In this unforgettable and happy moment, she was so excited that tears welled up in her eyes, and past events flooded her mind. The days of the old society were really hard! Her elderly father was forced to sew clothes for the bandit leaders, and the factory owner not only didn't pay him but also beat him into a cripple, eventually dying of poverty and disease; her two younger brothers also died early due to hunger and disease. The burden of life ruthlessly weighed on the back of this girl who was only a teenager, and her mother sent her to work as a hired hand with tears in her eyes. Once, when repairing a bridge for the bandits, she dumped the wrong amount of soil and was severely beaten by the supervisor. The dark clouds could not cover the sun. In 1950, the five-star red flag was raised on the Yushu grassland. She, a poor girl who used to be treated like a beast of burden, gained the right to be a human being for the first time. She worked as a cleaner in the government office, and the Han Chinese cadres affectionately called her comrade, explained revolutionary principles to her, and helped her study culture at night. When her family was in difficulty, the government distributed relief grain and clothing. She felt for the first time that life was so beautiful. She wholeheartedly and selflessly dedicated herself to her work. In 1956, Zhuoma Qingcuo gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, she took the lead in organizing a mutual aid group with six poor herdsmen, resolutely taking the socialist road. At this time, a reactionary herdowner threatened her, saying: "If you follow the Communist Party, be careful of your head!" She answered with righteous indignation: "Even if it costs me my life, I will follow the path pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao!" In the happy moment of meeting the leader, she secretly made up her mind: "I must build my hometown even more beautifully and let the Tibetan people live a happy life of plenty."

    Returning to her hometown from Beijing, Zhuoma Qingcuo felt full of energy and couldn't wait to throw herself into the torrent of labor. She ran around publicizing the advanced deeds of national women heroes, leading commune members in reclaiming wasteland and accumulating fertilizer, and organizing women to engage in high-yield experimental fields. Through the efforts of all the commune members, in 1959, the total sown area of the entire commune was expanded to more than 19,000 mu, and the total grain output increased by more than 60% compared with 1958. The women's high-yield field she personally managed yielded as much as 980 jin of highland barley per mu on more than two mu. In this year, the entire commune achieved self-sufficiency in grain for the first time.

    In the winter of 1959, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward the policy that the national economy should be based on agriculture. Zhuoma Qingcuo set even greater ambitions: "Advance victoriously and produce more grain to support national construction." At this time, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee issued a battle call to march into the wasteland and demand grain from the land. According to the decision of the commune Party committee, Zhuoma Qingcuo led more than 800 commune members to form a wasteland reclamation army and went to Shantangtan and Changugou, more than 20 li away, to reclaim wasteland. The wasteland was all hardened black turf that had not been touched for many years. It took several strokes of the hoe to loosen a piece of land the size of a fist. Later, as goose feather snow fell from the sky, the hoe only left a few white marks. At this time, a few commune members said: "We can't dig it. How long will it take to finish digging like this!" The cold weather could not scare the Communists. Zhuoma, with the help of the Yushu County Party Committee working group, organized commune members to conduct in-depth discussions to make everyone understand the significance of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, and put forward the heroic slogan of "The cold can't freeze our determination, and the hard ground can't be harder than our drive." Subsequently, she went deep into the construction site to mobilize commune members to burn cow dung to heat the ground at night, and during the day, she organized red flag competitions between teams and between people. After a winter and spring of hard work, the entire commune reclaimed more than 27,000 mu of wasteland, and the sown area was expanded to more than 46,000 mu, more than double that of last year, firing the first shot for the continued great leap forward in agriculture in 1960.

    Zhuoma Qingcuo's outstanding labor and selfless work have won the love of all commune members. This year, she was also elected as the director of the commune and served as the deputy secretary of the commune Party committee. Her work became even busier. At this time, the Party encouraged her: as long as you remember the words of the revolutionary leader, are not complacent, and do not become arrogant, and always put the interests of the Party and the masses first, you can always be a good servant of the people. She kept the Party's teachings in mind and threw herself into the battle to win a great agricultural harvest with even greater revolutionary enthusiasm. This year, in April and May, the task of rushing to plant was very tight. She was not feeling well, but she still plowed and planted with the commune members and went to various teams to inspect the work at night. In accordance with the Party's instruction to go deep into the front lines, she moved to the backward third production team of the third brigade and ate, lived, worked, and consulted with the commune members. Not only did she herself adhere to the "four togethers", but she also often used her practical actions to influence and educate grassroots cadres. Initially, Suo Anglancuo, the captain of the Yugu production team of the third brigade, did not go deep enough into his work style and participated in less labor. Zhuoma Qingcuo discovered this situation and took the initiative to talk to Suo Anglancuo, went to the fields with him to work, and also said to him: "The masses elected us as cadres because they trust us, and we must serve the masses wholeheartedly. If we don't do our work well, how can we be worthy of the Party and the masses?" With Zhuoma Qingcuo's help, Suo Anglancuo changed his work style, and the production of this team also quickly improved. In leading the work, Zhuoma Qingcuo often visited the commune members door to door, caring for and solving the practical difficulties of the masses. At the same time, she also often went deep into the kitchen to help run the canteen well. Zhuoma Qingcuo paid great attention to the combination of work and rest for male and female commune members and gave appropriate care to women in childbirth and the elderly. She often said: "If we do things according to the Party's instructions, we can do any work well; the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more the Party must care about the lives of the masses." For the benefit of the masses, she often forgot about herself. At the beginning of this year, in order to improve the lives of the commune members, the commune decided to organize a hunting expedition. Zhuoma Qingcuo stepped forward and guaranteed to the Party: "I am familiar with the situation, leave the task to me!" She led more than 20 commune members, braving the severe cold, and rode horses dozens of li away to the snow-capped mountains at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters to hunt. After more than two months, the hunting team hunted tens of thousands of jin of wild animal meat such as yellow sheep and wild donkeys. When the commune members ate the fragrant wild game, they all said with emotion: "Zhuoma Qingcuo is really our good secretary, she is not feeling well but she is still worried about everyone!"

    Recently, when we went to visit Zhuoma Qingcuo, she was leading dozens of women in the fields to harvest crops. The highland barley ears were as long as wolf tails, exuding an enticing fragrance. The Jiegushan peaks were covered with white snow, and the crops at the foot of the slope were endless, as if they were celestial brocade woven by heaven. Zhuoma Qingcuo pointed to the crops and said: "What a rare good harvest!" She also excitedly told us that this year, in addition to reserving enough food, seeds, and feed, the Hongqi Commune can also take out more than one million jin of grain to support national construction. She told us with full confidence: "This year is good, next year will be even better. I will always listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, raise the red banner of the People's Commune higher and higher, and be an outstanding red banner holder of the Party and the people!"

    藏族女红旗手——卓玛青措
    本报记者
    在玉树草原，藏族人民总是把“粮食”这个字眼同幸福联系在一起。多少年来，藏族牧民总想着有那么一天，再不会为一把糌粑弯腰折背给牧主当奴隶，能过上丰衣足食的生活。今天，当人民公社这面红旗在草原上升起不过二年，玉树藏族自治州结古红旗公社的社员不仅吃上了自己种植的粮食，而且还喜气洋洋地送交公粮，支援国家社会主义建设。
    一谈起这些翻天复地的变化，全国“三八”红旗手、红旗公社党委副书记兼社长卓玛青措，总是抑制不住内心的激动。
    1958年秋季，玉树藏族自治州第一个人民公社——结古红旗公社诞生了。二十四岁的藏族女共产党员卓玛青措被选为副社长兼妇联主任。11月，她光荣地去北京出席了全国妇女社会主义建设积极分子代表会议，在会上她听到了各个战线上妇女的英雄事迹，看到了刘胡兰和黄继光的妈妈，更使她激动的是看到了我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席！在这终生难忘的幸福时刻里，她兴奋得热泪盈眶，往事一幕幕地涌上心头。旧社会的日子真难熬呀！年老的父亲被逼着给马匪缝衣服，厂主不给工资还把他打成残废，最后贫病交迫而死；她的两个弟弟也因饥寒疾病早死。生活的重担无情地压在这个才十几岁的姑娘背上，母亲含着泪水把她送去当长工。有一次给马匪修桥，她倒错了土，被监工毒打一顿。乌云遮不住太阳，1950年，玉树草原升起了五星红旗。她，一个过去被当做牛马驱使的穷姑娘，第一次获得了做人的权利。她在机关里做勤杂工人，汉族干部都亲热地称她为同志，给她讲解革命的道理，夜晚还帮助她学习文化。她的家里有困难，政府发给救济粮食、衣物。她第一次感到生活是这样美好。她全心全意地忘我地工作。1956年卓玛青措光荣地参加了中国共产党。在互助合作化运动中，她带头领导六户贫苦牧民组织起互助组，坚决走社会主义道路。这时，反动牧主威胁她说：“跟共产党跑，小心你的脑袋！”她正义凛然地回答：“豁出命，也要按党和毛主席指引的路走！”在会见领袖的幸福时刻里，她暗暗下定决心：“我一定要把家乡建设得更加美丽，让藏族人民过着丰衣足食的幸福生活。”
    从北京回到故乡，卓玛青措感到浑身都是劲，迫不及待地投入到劳动的激流里。她东奔西跑到处宣传全国妇女英雄人物的先进事迹，领导社员开荒积肥，组织妇女搞丰产试验田。经过全体社员的努力，1959年全公社的播种面积扩大到一万九千多亩，粮食总产量比1958年增长60％多，她亲自经营的妇女丰产田，二亩多青稞亩产高达九百八十斤，这一年全公社第一次实现了粮食自给。
    1959年冬季，党中央和毛主席提出国民经济要以农业为基础的方针，卓玛青措立下了更大的雄心壮志：“乘胜前进，打下更多的粮食支援国家建设”。这时，中共青海省委发出向荒地进军、向大地要粮的战斗号召，根据公社党委的决定，卓玛青措率领八百多社员组成垦荒大军，到二十多里外的山塘滩、禅古沟开垦荒地。荒地尽是多年未动过的坚硬的黑草皮，镢头刨几下才松动拳头般大小一块土地。后来天上飘着鹅毛大雪，镢头下去只留几道白印。这时少数社员说：“挖不动啊，这样开下去，几时才能开完！”天寒地冻吓不倒共产党人，卓玛在中共玉树县委工作组的帮助下，组织社员进行深入讨论，使大伙认清大办农业大办粮食的意义，提出“天冻冻不了我们的决心，地硬硬不过我们的干劲”的豪迈口号。随后，她深入工地发动社员夜里烧牛粪烘地，白天就组织队与队、人与人之间的红旗竞赛。经过鏖战一冬春，全公社垦荒二万七千多亩，播种面积扩大到四万六千多亩，比去年又增加一倍多，打响了1960年农业继续跃进的第一炮。
    卓玛青措的出色劳动和忘我工作，赢得了全体社员的爱戴。今年，她又被选为社长，并担任了公社党委副书记。她的工作更繁忙了。这时党鼓励她：只要记住革命领袖的话，不自满，不骄傲，时时刻刻把党和群众的利益摆在第一位，就永远能做一个人民的好勤务员。她牢记着党的教诲，以更加旺盛的革命热情投入到夺取农业大丰收的战斗中。今年4、5月，突击抢种任务很紧，她身体有些不大好，照样和社员一起扶犁播种，夜里还到各队检查工作。她按照党的深入第一线的指示，搬到后进队第三大队，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。不仅她自己坚持“四同”，而且经常以自己的实际行动影响和教育基层干部。最初，第三大队御古生产队队长索昂兰措的工作作风不深入，参加劳动少。卓玛青措发现这种情况就主动找索昂兰措谈话，找他一起下地劳动，还对他说：“群众选我们当干部是信任我们，我们就得全心全意为群众服务。工作做不好，能对得起党和群众吗？”在卓玛青措的帮助下，索昂兰措改变了工作作风，这个队的生产也很快上去了。在领导工作中，卓玛青措经常挨户登门访问社员，关心和解决群众的实际困难，同时还经常深入灶房，帮助办好食堂。卓玛青措对男女社员的劳逸结合很注意，对产妇、老人也给以适当的照顾。她经常说：“按党的指示办事，什么工作都能做好；群众干劲越大，党就越要关心群众生活。”为了群众的利益，她常常忘掉了自己。今年年初，公社为了改善社员生活，决定组织打猎远征队。卓玛青措就挺身而出，向党保证说：“我熟悉情况，把任务交给我吧！”她领着二十多个社员，冒着严寒，骑马远到几十里以外的海拔四千多米的雪山中狩猎。经过两个多月，打猎队共猎获黄羊、野驴等野牲肉几十万斤。当社员们吃上香喷喷的野味时，都感动地说：“卓玛青措真是我们的好书记，自己身体不好还为大家操心！”
    最近，我们去访问卓玛青措的时候，她正领着几十个妇女在地里收获庄稼。青稞穗长得狼尾巴似的，散发着诱人的芳香。结古山巅白雪皑皑，坡下的庄稼一望无际，仿佛天工织就的天丝绣锦缎。卓玛青措指着庄稼说：“难得的好收成啊！”她还兴奋地告诉我们，今年红旗公社除了留足口粮、籽种、饲料外，还可以拿出一百多万斤粮食支援国家建设。她信心十足地对我们说：“今年好，明年更好。我要永远听党和毛主席的话，把人民公社这面红旗越举越高，做党和人民的出色的红旗手！”（附图片）
