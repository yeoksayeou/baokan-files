Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th. Prince Sihanouk, the Head of State of Cambodia, spoke to the press in Paris on the 17th, emphasizing that Cambodia and Laos should pursue a neutral policy.

Sihanouk said: "I have already explained my plan to neutralize Cambodia and Laos at the United Nations. The purpose of this plan is to establish a group of buffer states in this particularly sensitive area, thereby avoiding direct contact between Eastern and Western countries."

Sihanouk continued: "The neutral policy pursued by Cambodia ensures the stability of Cambodia. Only by pursuing such a policy can Laos escape the dangerous situation it is currently in." Sihanouk said, "This neutral policy should be guaranteed by major powers." Sihanouk said that he would explain his plan to these countries during his visit to Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, and China. He went on to say, "As for Cambodia's two neighbors, Thailand and South Vietnam, they are openly opposed to any neutral policy."

    西哈努克亲王在巴黎发表谈话
    老挝奉行中立政策才能摆脱危险
    新华社巴黎18日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王17日在巴黎向报界发表谈话，强调柬埔寨和老挝应奉行中立政策。
    西哈努克说：“我已经在联合国阐述了我的使柬埔寨和老挝中立化的计划，这个计划的目的在于在这个特别敏感的地区建立一批缓冲国，从而避免东方和西方国家之间的直接接触”。
    西哈努克接着说：“柬埔寨所奉行的中立政策确保了柬埔寨的稳定，老挝也只有奉行这样的政策，才能使它摆脱目前所处的危险境地”。西哈努克说，“这种中立政策应当得到大国的保证”。西哈努克表示他要在这次访问捷克斯洛伐克、苏联、蒙古人民共和国和中国的时候向这些国家阐述他的计划。他接着说，“至于柬埔寨的两个邻居——泰国和越南南方，它们是露骨地反对任何中立政策的”。
