    Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: Guatemala City Report: The Guatemalan Labor Party recently issued a statement condemning the Ydígoras government of Guatemala for acting as a tool of aggression against Cuba.
    The statement said that the Ydígoras government's complete submission to U.S. interests has led it to even cede territory in exchange for dollars, allowing Guatemalan territory to be used as a base for military training and launching a criminal aggression against Cuba. This is not only participating in aggression against the Cuban people, but in fact signifies another detestable intervention by U.S. imperialism in Guatemala.
    The statement revealed that in Guatemala, approximately six thousand people have received military training, and these individuals had already departed on thirteen ships on the night of October 27th for Swan Island in Nicaragua and Honduras, in order to launch an aggression against Cuba from Swan Island. However, the recently constructed airports, radar equipment, other military facilities, bombers, and military supplies still remain in Guatemala. In addition, there are announcements regarding the possibility of allowing a "friendly power" to establish military bases in our country. However, the government is attempting to deceive the people by declaring that the aggression against Cuba is hypothetical, but the Guatemalan people know the truth and will never be fooled.
    The statement issued a call to the Guatemalan people, saying that the moment to stop this chaos, corruption, and criminal provocation has arrived; the moment to prevent our motherland from being threatened by the government's capitulationism and reckless behavior has arrived. Guatemala has no reason to pull chestnuts out of the fire for U.S. imperialists.
    Xinhua News Agency, San José, November 12th: Arnoldo Ferreto, a member of the Central Committee of the Costa Rican People's Vanguard Party, issued a statement calling for vigilance against "the sinister conspiracies to use our country to carry out activities against Cuba."
    The statement accuses the Costa Rican Minister of Interior of "yielding to easily imaginable forces" and following suit in spreading the lie of a "Cuban expeditionary force invading" Costa Rica.
    Arnoldo Ferreto's statement pointed out that the purpose of the slander and defamation against Cuba is to "create an anti-Cuban hysteria" in order to continue creating pretexts internationally for aggression against Cuba.
    Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, November 14th: Jóvito Villalba, President of the Democratic Republican Union of Venezuela, said in a televised address to the nation yesterday, "We members of the Democratic Republican Union are friends of the Cuban revolution, and friends of the people of all democratic countries in the world."
    He said, "When we say that we are friends of the Cuban revolution, we sincerely express our unwavering determination to fight to defend the right of the Cuban people to decide their own political destiny."
    Xinhua News Agency, November 12th: According to a Latin American News Agency report from La Paz, the Bolivian Construction Workers' Federation called on the 11th to organize a militia ready to defend Cuba at any time. In this strong statement, the construction workers demanded that strong actions be taken against imperialism, and they also demanded that violent demonstrations be held against U.S. representative agencies if an armed attack against Cuba occurs.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: Ottawa Report: The Communist Party of Canada condemns the U.S. aggressive actions in Cuba and demands the development of trade and friendly relations between Canada and Cuba.
    The National Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Canada wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Diefenbaker last week, which said: "Canadians are shocked by the belligerent aggressive threats of the two U.S. presidential candidates and the provocative display of force by the massive U.S. Marine landing in Guantanamo."
    The open letter pointed out that due to U.S. military intervention in Cuba, Canada faces the terrible danger of being dragged into war. It demanded that Diefenbaker immediately condemn U.S. aggressive actions in the strongest terms.
    The open letter also suggested taking active measures to develop trade and friendly relations between Canada and Cuba. It pointed out that Canadian industry and agriculture, currently severely affected by unemployment, desperately need to prosper from trade with Cuba. The letter opposed colluding with U.S. authorities to economically strangle Cuba, and demanded that the Canadian government take over and operate any U.S. subsidiaries that refuse to do business with Cuba.
    The open letter concluded, "The heroic and victorious struggle launched by our neighbor Cuba to break free from U.S. rule inspires patriotic Canadians. Breaking free from U.S. rule is also our country's biggest problem." The letter also said that Canadians know that "helping Cuba's heroic resistance is also helping ourselves to become masters of our own nation." (Attached picture)

    拉丁美洲人民决不当美国侵略工具
    危地马拉、哥斯达黎加、委内瑞拉和玻利维亚公众声援古巴兄弟
    加拿大共产党要求政府谴责美国对古巴的军事干涉
    据新华社15日讯　危地马拉城消息：危地马拉劳动党最近发表声明，谴责危地马拉伊迪戈拉斯政府充当侵略古巴的工具。
    声明说，伊迪戈拉斯政府对美国利益的完全屈从使得它甚至出让国土来换取美元，使危地马拉的领土被利用来作为进行军事训练和对古巴发动罪恶侵略的基地。这不仅是参与反对古巴人民的侵略活动，而事实上意味着美帝国主义对危地马拉又一次新的可憎的干涉。
    声明揭露，在危地马拉，约有六千人接受了军事训练，这些人已经在10月27日晚乘十三只船前往尼加拉瓜和洪都拉斯的天鹅岛，以便从天鹅岛开始对古巴的侵略。但是，在危地马拉，最近建筑的机场、那些雷达设备和其他军事设施、轰炸机和军需品等依然存在。此外，还有关于允许一个“友好强国”在我国建立军事基地的可能性的宣告。但是，政府企图欺骗人民，宣布说侵略古巴是假想的，但是危地马拉人知道事实真象，他们绝不会被蒙骗。
    声明向危地马拉人民发出号召说，制止这种混乱、腐化以及罪恶挑衅的时刻已经到了；使我们祖国不再受政府的投降主义和胡作非为的威胁的时刻已经到了。危地马拉没有任何理由为美帝国主义者火中取栗。
    据新华社圣约瑟12日电　哥斯达黎加人民先锋党中央委员会委员阿诺耳多·费里托发表声明，要求警惕“我国正被利用来进行反对古巴的罪恶阴谋”。
    声明里指责哥斯达黎加内政部长“屈从很容易想见的势力”，也跟在后面散布所谓“古巴远征军入侵”哥斯达黎加的谎言。
    阿诺耳多·费里托声明中指出，对古巴的中伤和诬蔑的目的，在于“制造反古巴的歇斯底里气氛”，以便在国际上为侵略古巴继续制造借口。
    据新华社加拉加斯14日电　委内瑞拉共和民主联盟主席霍维托·比利亚耳瓦昨天向全国发表电视演说时说，“我们共和民主联盟党员是古巴革命的朋友，也是世界所有民主国家人民的朋友。”
    他说，“当我们说我们是古巴革命的朋友时，我们诚心地表示我们坚定不移的决心，要为保卫古巴人民决定自己政治命运的权利而斗争。”
    新华社12日讯　据拉丁美洲通讯社自拉巴斯报道，玻利维亚建筑工人联合会11日号召组织一支随时准备保卫古巴的民兵。建筑工人在这个强有力的声明中要求采取有力的行动来反对帝国主义，他们还要求，假如发生对古巴的武装进攻，就向美国代表机构举行暴力示威。
    新华社15日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大共产党谴责美国在古巴的侵略行动，并且要求发展加拿大同古巴的贸易和友好关系。
    加拿大共产党全国执行委员会在上星期写了一封公开信给迪芬贝克总理，这封信说：“加拿大人对美国两个总统候选人好战的侵略威胁，对美国大批海军陆战队在关塔那摩登陆所表现的挑衅性的耀武扬威的行动，感到震惊。”
    公开信指出，由于美国对古巴进行军事干涉，加拿大面临被拖入战争的可怕危险。它要求迪芬贝克立即以最强烈的字眼谴责美国的侵略行动。
    公开信还建议采取积极的措施来发展加拿大同古巴的贸易和友好关系。它指出，目前受到失业严重打击的加拿大工农业非常需要使它同古巴的贸易兴隆。信件反对同美国当局勾结在一起从经济上窒息古巴，并且要求加拿大政府接管和经营拒绝同古巴做生意的任何美国子公司。
    公开信最后说，“我们的邻国古巴所发动的摆脱美国统治的英勇和胜利的斗争，鼓舞了爱国的加拿大人。摆脱美国的统治也是我国最大的问题。”信件还说，加拿大人知道，“帮助古巴的英勇的反抗也就是帮助自己成为国家的主人”。（附图片）
