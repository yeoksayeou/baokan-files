Xinhua News Agency, November 9th, New York Dispatch: The speakers of both houses of the Congolese parliament have separately telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, stating that Congolese President Kasavubu's unauthorized departure from the Congo on the 6th to attend the UN General Assembly's discussion on the Congo issue does not represent the Congolese people and the nation.

These telegrams and other documents were released at the United Nations on the 8th.

Congolese Speaker of the House Kasongo said in his telegram that as the head of state, Kasavubu "left the country without notifying the (Congolese) parliament, accompanied by his Belgian and French technical advisors." The parliament protests his action.

The telegram pointed out that Kasavubu did not obtain the parliament's consent before leaving the country. "Since his trip is not official, therefore, he does not speak for the Congolese people." The telegram stated that the parliament assumes no responsibility for Kasavubu's unofficial trip.

Congolese Senate Speaker Okito's telegram stated that Kasavubu's attendance at the UN General Assembly is unjustified because the head of state does not formulate the country's policies, and therefore, "he has no right to represent the country at international conferences without prior consent from the people." Okito requested that Thomas Kanza, the representative of the legitimate Congolese government to the United Nations, represent the Congo at the UN General Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, November 10th, Leopoldville Dispatch: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba and Leopoldville Provincial Governor Kamitatu have issued separate statements declaring that President Kasavubu's attendance at the UN General Assembly cannot represent the Congolese nation.

Prime Minister Lumumba said in a statement to the press on the 9th, "According to the Fundamental Law, Kasavubu does not bear the responsibility of governing." He said, "Only the legitimate government led by myself, supported by the parliament and the whole country, is qualified to participate in the UN General Assembly debate."

Kamitatu stated that Kasavubu has no right to represent the Congolese government at the United Nations. He said that the Congolese parliament has not withdrawn its confidence in Lumumba, and only the delegation appointed by the legitimate Lumumba government can represent the Congo in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, November 10th, New York Dispatch: The UN General Assembly plenary session began debating the situation in the Congo on the 8th. Congolese President Kasavubu traveled from Leopoldville to New York to participate in this debate.

Kasavubu began his speech by praising the United Nations and the "United Nations forces" for entering the Congo. Kasavubu claimed that he "is the sole spokesman for the Congolese people," and he demanded that the UN General Assembly quickly accept the delegation he appointed to attend the conference, headed by himself and including Bomboko, etc. He explained that the intentions of the Katanga secessionist group "are often misunderstood."

The General Assembly then discussed a proposal put forward by Guinea, Ghana, and six other countries, which requested that the General Assembly allow the representatives of the Congolese central government headed by Lumumba to occupy seats in the General Assembly and its other institutions before the Credentials Committee of the General Assembly makes a report.

Guinean representative Ismael Touré strongly condemned imperialism and its running dogs for undermining the Congolese constitution and creating chaos in the Congo. He emphasized that Prime Minister Lumumba's government is the only legitimate government qualified to speak for the Congolese people. He demanded that the General Assembly immediately allow the delegation of the legitimate government of the Republic of the Congo to take its seat. Touré expressed disagreement with Kasavubu's request to allow a delegation headed by Kasavubu to obtain Congo's seat.

Soviet representative Zorin delivered a long speech at the meeting on the 8th.

Zorin pointed out that the "United Nations forces" headquarters in the Congo and the UN Secretary-General, from the beginning, not only did not help Lumumba's legitimate government to maintain the country's political independence and territorial integrity, but did their best to prevent this government from properly exercising its functions. They are participants in the conspiracy against Congolese independence.

The Soviet representative pointed out that it is necessary to stop the colonialist countries' further interference in the internal affairs of the Congolese people and to provide the legitimate central government of the Republic of the Congo with the possibility of exercising its functions domestically and representing the country in the United Nations. The meeting on the 8th was adjourned after Zorin's speech.

At the meeting on the afternoon of the 9th, Polish representative Winiewicz also emphasized that the government headed by Lumumba is the only legitimate government of the Congo, and only this government has the right to implement the domestic and foreign policies of the Republic of the Congo. Argentine representative Amadeo attempted to deny the legitimacy of the Lumumba government, arguing that Congolese President Kasavubu is the only official in the Congo exercising his functions.

Ghanaian representative Quaison-Sackey proposed a motion at the meeting requesting the General Assembly to temporarily suspend the debate on the Congo issue. He announced that fifteen Asian and African countries have formed a mediation committee to go to the Congo to help resolve the country's internal political differences. He requested that the debate on the Congo issue be suspended until this committee submits a relevant report to the General Assembly.

The Ghanaian representative's proposal was supported by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as many Asian and African countries. Western countries such as the United States, Britain, and France expressed their opposition. The Associated Press reported yesterday that "well-informed sources said that the United States had intended to push for swift action to allow President Kasavubu and a delegation representing him to obtain seats in the General Assembly."

The General Assembly then voted on the Ghanaian proposal, which was passed with forty-eight votes in favor, thirty votes against (Western countries such as the United States, Britain, and France), and eighteen abstentions.

It is reported that the fifteen-nation Asian-African mediation committee will leave for the Congo next week.

    刚果两院议长和卢蒙巴总理等发表声明
    不承认卡萨武布有权代表国家出席联大
    联大辩论刚果问题苏、几等国代表要求让卢蒙巴政府代表取得刚果席位
    据新华社9日讯　纽约消息：刚果议会参众两院议长分别致电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，声明刚果总统卡萨武布于6日擅自离开刚果去出席联合国大会关于刚果问题的讨论并不能代表刚果人民和国家。
    这些电报和其他一些文件是8日在联合国发表的。
    刚果众议院议长卡松戈在电报中说，作为国家元首的卡萨武布“在他的比利时和法国技术顾问的陪同下，没有通知（刚果）议会”就离开国家。议会抗议他的这种行动。
    电报指出，卡萨武布出国时没有得到议会的同意。“既然他的旅行不是正式的，因此，他并不代表刚果人民讲话”。电报表示议会对卡萨武布这次非正式的旅行不担负任何责任。
    刚果参议院议长奥基托的电报说，卡萨武布出席联合国大会是没有理由的，因为国家元首并不制订国家的政策，因此，“没有在事先得到人民的同意，他无权在国际会议上代表国家”。奥基托要求让刚果合法政府驻联合国代表托马斯·坎扎代表刚果出席联合国大会。
    新华社10日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴和利奥波德维尔省省长卡米塔图分别发表声明，宣布卡萨武布总统出席联合国大会不能代表刚果国家。
    卢蒙巴总理在9日向报界发表的声明中说，“根据根本法，卡萨武布不担负执政的责任”。他说，“只有我本人领导的、受到议会和全国支持的合法政府才有资格参加联合国大会的辩论。”
    卡米塔图在声明中否认卡萨武布有权在联合国代表刚果政府。他说，刚果议会并没有撤销对卢蒙巴的信任，只有卢蒙巴合法政府任命的代表团才能在联合国中代表刚果。
    据新华社10日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议8日开始辩论刚果局势问题。刚果总统卡萨武布特别从利奥波德维尔赶到纽约参加这次辩论。
    卡萨武布讲话一开始就对联合国和
  “联合国军”开入刚果表示赞扬。卡萨武布自称他“是刚果人民的唯一的发言人”，他要求联合国大会迅速接纳他所任命的出席大会的代表团，这个代表团以他自己为首，并包括邦博托等。他解释说，加丹加冲伯卖国集团的意图“往往被误解”。
    大会接着讨论几内亚、加纳等八国向大会提出的一项提案，这项提案要求大会在大会资格审查委员会作出报告之前就让以卢蒙巴为首的刚果中央政府的代表在大会和它的其他机构中占有席位。
    几内亚代表伊斯梅尔·杜尔在发言中强烈谴责帝国主义及其走狗破坏刚果宪法和在刚果制造混乱。他强调指出，卢蒙巴总理的政府是有资格代表刚果人民发言的唯一的合法政府。他要求大会立即让刚果共和国合法政府的代表团取得它的席位。杜尔表示不同意卡萨武布提出的让以卡萨武布为首的代表团取得刚果席位的要求。
    苏联代表佐林在8日会议上作了长篇发言。
    佐林指出，在刚果的“联合国军”司令部和联合国秘书长从一开始就不仅没有帮助卢蒙巴的合法政府来维护这个国家的政治独立和领土完整，反而竭尽全力使这个政府不能正常地行使职权。他们是反对刚果独立阴谋的参加者。
    苏联代表指出，必须制止殖民主义国家对刚果人民内政的进一步干涉，并为刚果共和国合法的中央政府提供在国内行使职权以及在联合国中代表这个国家的可能性。佐林发言后8日会议宣布休会。
    在9日下午的会议上，波兰代表维尼维奇也强调指出，以卢蒙巴为首的政府是刚果的唯一合法政府，只有这个政府才有权执行刚果共和国的国内外政策。阿根廷代表阿马德奥企图否认卢蒙巴政府的合法性，认为刚果总统卡萨武布是在刚果唯一行使他的职权的官员。
    加纳代表奎森—萨基在会议上提出了一项要求大会暂时中止关于刚果问题的辩论的动议。他宣布，亚非十五个国家已经组成了一个调解委员会前往刚果帮助解决这个国家国内的政治分歧，他要求在这个委员会向大会提出有关的报告之前，暂停关于刚果问题的辩论。
    加纳代表的建议得到苏联和其他社会主义国家以及许多亚非国家的支持。美国、英国、法国等西方国家表示反对。美联社昨天说，“消息灵通人士说，美国曾打算力促迅速采取行动让卡萨武布总统和代表他的一个代表团在大会取得席位。”
    大会接着对加纳建议进行表决，这项建议在四十八票赞成、三十票反对（美、英、法等西方国家）和十八票弃权情况下获得通过。
    据报道，亚非十五国调解委员会将在下星期动身前往刚果。
