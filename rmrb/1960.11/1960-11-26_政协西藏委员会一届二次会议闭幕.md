Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 25th: The Second Plenary Session of the First Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Tibetan Committee was held in Lhasa from the 9th to the 18th. More than 340 members and delegates from all parts of Tibet, various ethnic groups, all sectors, and all social strata participated in the meeting.

Sangpo Tenzin Dondup, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Tibetan Committee, delivered a report on the main work of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC Tibetan Committee over the past year and opinions on future work. The report proposed that the CPPCC Tibetan Committee should continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front in the future, so as to contribute to consolidating the unification of the motherland, strengthening national unity, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and thoroughly completing the democratic reform and taking the socialist road.

Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and Chairman of the CPPCC Tibetan Committee, reported on the current situation in Tibet and the tasks for the future. When talking about the excellent situation in Tibet, he said: At present, the democratic reform in agricultural areas and the "Three Antis and Two Benefits" (anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvee system, anti-personal dependence, and benefits for both herdsmen and herd owners) movement in pastoral areas have been expanded to areas with a population of 1.01 million; the "Three Antis" movement (anti-rebellion, anti-feudal privilege, anti-exploitation and oppression system) has been carried out in the vast majority of temples and monasteries in the region. The heavy feudal exploitation and a large number of brutal and ugly facts exposed from within the temples and religions have profoundly educated the vast number of monks and nuns and raised their political consciousness, and the religious beliefs of the broad masses of working people have gained genuine freedom. After becoming masters of the new society and the land, the millions of serfs who had been enslaved and exploited for a long time have seen unprecedented increases in their class consciousness, patriotic enthusiasm, and labor enthusiasm. More than 100,000 farming households have joined mutual aid teams under the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit," and they have achieved bumper harvests in this year's patriotic bumper harvest movement. He also pointed out that due to the victory of the democratic reform, the Party and the government's adoption of a redemption policy in the democratic reform, and the strengthening of the united front work for upper-class figures, Tibet's united front has also been further consolidated and expanded.

Tan Guansan then described the great achievements of the Party and the government in implementing the policy of peaceful reform based on Tibet's specific conditions, the steps and methods for carrying out democratic reform, the work of the people's democratic united front, and the implementation of policies such as redemption and freedom of religious belief, as well as the tasks for the future. He said that the main tasks for the future are: to continue to fully mobilize the masses, unite all forces that can be united, consolidate national defense in all aspects, further strengthen national unity and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, thoroughly complete the democratic reform in areas where reform has not yet been completed, gradually develop the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, vigorously develop agricultural and pastoral production, and correspondingly develop transportation, cultural, educational, and health undertakings, so as to lay a solid foundation for building a socialist new Tibet.

Pabala Gelleg Namgyal, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC and Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Ngabo Ngawang Jigme attended the opening ceremony. Ngabo Ngawang Jigme also delivered a report on behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region on the development of agricultural and pastoral production, transportation, cultural, educational, and health undertakings in Tibet over the past year. Zhang Chengwu, Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and Secretary-General of the CPPCC Tibet Committee, made an explanation on the implementation of the redemption policy and the settlement of the rent for "two-eight" rent reduction before the distribution of land. Langdun Gonga Wangchuk, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Tibetan Committee, put forward opinions from the Standing Committee of the CPPCC Tibetan Committee on organizing middle and upper-class figures to study. In his proposed opinions, he said that in order to meet the requirements of the vast number of middle and upper-class figures in Tibet, the CPPCC will be used as the center in the future to organize middle and upper-class figures to study Chairman Mao's works and various policies of the Party in a planned way.

The participants in the meeting conducted serious and enthusiastic discussions on the above-mentioned reports and opinions, and negotiated on the payment of redemption money and the outstanding issues of the "two-eight" rent reduction. Finally, a resolution was adopted. The resolution pointed out that through this meeting, the participants had a deeper understanding of the complete correctness of the Party's policy of peaceful reform in Tibet. The resolution called on middle and upper-class figures to strengthen their study and self-ideological transformation in the future, work actively, firmly stand on the side of the people, unite around the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely listen to the Party, and resolutely follow the Party. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, we will hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, and forge ahead courageously.

Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, attended the closing ceremony of the meeting and delivered a speech. He talked about the Party's united front policy and the study and self-reform of middle and upper-class figures in Tibet.

    谭冠三接着讲述了党和政府根据西藏具体情况实行的和平改革的方针，进行民主改革的步骤、方法，人民民主统一战线工作，贯彻执行赎买、宗教信仰自由等政策的巨大成就以及今后的任务。他说，今后的主要任务是：继续充分发动群众，团结一切可以团结的力量，从各方面巩固祖国国防，进一步加强民族团结和巩固人民民主专政，彻底完成尚未完成改革地区的民主改革，逐步开展互助合作运动，大力发展农牧业生产，并相应地发展交通运输和文教卫生事业，为建设社会主义的新西藏打下巩固的基础。
    政协全国委员会副主席、西藏自治区筹备委员会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰、阿沛·阿旺晋美参加了开幕式，阿沛·阿旺晋美并代表西藏自治区筹备委员会在会上作了西藏一年来农牧业生产、交通运输以及文教卫生等事业发展情况的报告。中共西藏工委统战部部长、政协西藏委员会秘书长张承武在会上作了关于贯彻执行赎买政策，清理分配土地前“二八”减租的租金等问题的说明。政协西藏委员会副主席朗顿·滚噶旺秋在会上提出了政协西藏委员会常委会关于组织中、上层人士学习的意见。他提出的意见中说，为了满足西藏广大中、上层人士的要求，今后将以政协为中心，有计划地组织中、上层人士学习毛主席著作和党的各项政策。
    参加会议的人员对上述报告、意见等进行了认真热烈的讨论，对支付赎买金和“二八”减租的遗留问题进行了协商，最后通过了一项决议。决议指出，经过这次会议，与会人员更加深刻地认识到党在西藏地区实行和平改革方针的完全正确。决议中号召中、上层人士今后要加强学习和自我思想改造，积极工作，坚决站在人民的立场上，团结在中国共产党的周围，坚决听党的话，坚决跟着党走。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，高举总路线、大跃进、人民公社的三面红旗，奋勇前进。
