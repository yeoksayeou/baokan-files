    In the Cuban Countryside
    Carlos Esdela

    This dispatch may be valuable because it is written based on direct notes taken during a visit to the Cuban countryside. The records reproduced here are all what we noted at the time; no attention has been paid to format, no literary additions have been made, no embellishments have been added, and no attempts have been made to organize the impressions gained after the fact.

    We left Havana at 7:30 in the morning. Along the way, we passed many famous beaches on the north coast of Havana Province: Bacuranao, El Megano, Sibaracoa, Arroyo Bermejo. We had previously visited the buildings belonging to the "National Savings and Housing Council" in eastern Havana. These buildings were among the first to be taken over by the "National Savings and Housing Council" according to one of the thirteen basic laws of the revolutionary government, the law of February 17, 1959. Before the revolution, the "National Savings and Housing Council" was the "National Lottery Issuing Office." I carried with me for reference the original text of the Land Reform Law and twelve other important laws. The preamble to the law establishing the "National Savings and Housing Council" states:

  “Since the early days of the Republic, the 'National Lottery Issuing Office' has been a state institution that serves to promote vices and to enrich political groups and rulers who take turns in power. These people obtain bonuses and dividends by holding positions that are for them a source of filth and immorality.”

    Now, it has been replaced by an autonomous body, namely the aforementioned
  “Council,” whose tasks are:

    1. To encourage the people to save the funds that until now have been placed in gambling.

    2. To invest the funds that can be collected through this plan and all the funds that can be mobilized in order to completely solve the housing problem in our country, thereby eliminating profits and exploitation in these two aspects of national life.

    3. To enable middle- and lower-class residents to benefit from loans.

    4. As this institution continues to achieve its goals, to promote other investments that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

      The “Council” issues securities to replace the lottery tickets of the past lottery issuing office. The old lottery was drawn once a month, with a prize of one hundred thousand pesos (Cuban currency unit, equivalent to the US dollar) and one thousand prizes of one hundred pesos.

    The buildings we visited were located in the suburbs of Havana, spacious and bright. According to the person who led our visit, these houses are part of a housing plan based on ten thousand houses, and will be extended inland.

    There were few fancy cars on the road. This is because the distorted reports of American news agencies on Cuba have greatly reduced the number of American tourists; another reason is that the Cuban revolutionary government restricts the import of fancy cars. The import of fancy cars once made Cuba one of the best markets for American car manufacturers. One of my companions said: “Fidel Castro said that whoever wants to spend US dollars to buy a car must also buy a tractor at the same time.”

    We have now arrived at the "Free Cuba" agricultural cooperative located in the city of Jovellanos, where peanuts, sugarcane, kidney beans, potatoes, and other crops are grown. These crops are rapidly providing increasing returns.

    We had extensive conversations with the farmers. Their lives are changing, and they are benefiting from the Land Reform Law. A comfortable house with sanitary facilities has been built near the old, uninhabitable thatched hut. I asked an elderly man what the average wage was, and he said: an average of three pesos per day, which is twice as much as he used to earn. In addition, he can get loans from the People's Store. Therefore, usury can no longer oppress him or exploit him.

    We spoke with technicians, one of whom said: The revolution has mobilized the enormous potential of Cuban human and economic resources. The rural people are working hard, not because someone is forcing them to do so, but because they see the benefits of their labor. They have put forward many initiatives for the comprehensive utilization of products. For example, in the past people only said: "Sugar, sugar, sugar." Now people are making artificial wood (he pointed out a door made of artificial wood to us) and excellent newsprint from sugarcane. Currently, there are more than a dozen by-products of sugarcane.

    In the Cuban countryside, I saw the Cuban people working diligently day and night. They know that they must rely on their own strength to do a good job in production and be prepared to deal with any emergencies, so that the enemies of the revolution cannot get their claws on the Cuban people's necks. This reminded me of the slogan I saw everywhere in Havana: "Using domestic products is patriotic!"

    The Cuban people greatly admire the achievements of the Soviet Union and China, but they
  believe that Cuba's land reform and all the reforms carried out in the social sphere must be Cuban-style, and everything must be adapted to the characteristics of the country. For example, I heard in a cooperative: "A slanderous movement attempts to portray Cuba's agricultural cooperatives as copies of Soviet collective farms. That is not the case. Our cooperatives here are organized according to our needs."

      "Cubanization" is a frequently repeated phrase. At the first exhibition of Cuban products, when we were drinking coffee in a room of a cooperative, one of my companions said to me that Fidel Castro said this: "We have begun to advocate loving our own products, loving our motherland, and loving everything that belongs to us. First of all, we have made Cuba move towards Cubanization, which may seem like a paradox, but Cuba was indeed not Cubanized in the past, Cuba was not Cuba for Cubans." Now all this has disappeared with the victory and development of the revolution.

    The cooperative movement is being vigorously promoted in the Cuban countryside, and nearly two thousand cooperatives have now been organized. Farmers will receive the necessary technical and economic assistance through the cooperatives to enable a larger number of farmers to participate in production. The Land Reform Law prohibits the large estate system. The maximum area of land that a natural or legal person can own is thirty caballerías (each caballería is equal to 201.45 Chinese mu). Bernigno Hernández, a tall and strong farmer who had been working in the fields for 54 years, said to us: "In the past, the land here belonged to one owner." After saying this, he cut some papayas with a wide machete and offered them to us. He knew clearly how many harvests there were in this place in a year. In the past, the only things lacking were technology and intensive cultivation. Today, they feel that they are working for their own well-being and for the prosperity of their motherland. Another farmer holding a machete said to us: "If the enemy wants to attack us, let them come right away. Whoever comes here to take away our machetes will be killed by them."

    In the Cuban countryside, I also saw that the farmers and the rebel army are cooperating closely. The troops are helping the farmers with their work.

    Each cooperative has its own hospital, as well as a place with a People's Store, a clinic and a pharmacy, and a first-aid hospital with eight beds. The army brings them medicine, and a military doctor comes to the hospital at least once a week for free diagnosis.

    Later, we visited a cooperative called "Central Australian Asia." It was originally a Spanish property, a large estate with many rooms specially used to accommodate guests. The courtyard is like a museum of Andalusian cornflowers (plant name). A row of houses has been around for over a hundred years, and the garden has all kinds of fruit trees. Now this place is a center for collective cultivation, used to expand the production of oranges and avocados.

    After visiting other social projects in the countryside, we came to the Zapata Swamp. This is a large area of land that until recently was difficult to access and unsuitable for habitation. A large part of its resources has not yet been explored, but with the implementation of the "Drain the Swamp Plan," "Agricultural Development Plan," and the revolutionary government's "Travel Business Plan," it will change its old appearance in a truly exciting way.

    First, large highways were built on the muddy ground, then general highways, and then forestry and coal mining cooperatives were established. This area is working in full swing. Obviously, they are fighting against nature, using practical actions to shatter the imperialist slander that Cubans are lazy and leisurely.

    In Cuba, all work is progressing rapidly. The face of the old countryside is changing, and many old and dilapidated small thatched huts will gradually be replaced by small cities. Fidel Castro plans to build hundreds of such small cities in the countryside. The size of the small cities varies. For example, in Pinar del Río province, there is a field of 466 hectares planted with tobacco. This land is so fertile that it usually brought the Batista Minister of Agriculture, Petro Menéndez, a profit of 150,000 US dollars every year. Today, it has become the center of one of those new cities. There are one hundred and twenty houses here. These houses will be transferred to cooperative farmers as personal property within three years. Every Sunday, people come from as far as eighty kilometers away to visit. The visitors are not all farmers, but they want to see the changes taking place in Cuba and share the honor of the country.

    At present, Cuba's land reform has basically ended, and the land of Cuban and American large estate owners has been expropriated according to the Land Reform Law. Farmers who lack land or have little land have been allocated land, and their enthusiasm for labor is unprecedentedly high. While stepping up production, they also participate in militia organizations and receive military training, ready to fight to defend the revolution and defend the land at any time. In the Cuban countryside, I have seen more than once farmers carrying guns while engaged in cultivation. "Swear to defend the motherland to the death!" and "We will win!" are no longer just slogans, but the actual actions of the Cuban people. With such people, the Cuban revolution is invincible.

    在古巴农村
    卡洛斯·埃斯德拉达
    这篇通讯可能有价值，因为它是根据在古巴农村参观时直接记录下来的笔记写成的。这里复述的记录都是我们当时记下来的；没有注意格式，没有补充一点文学的东西，没有进行修饰，也没有在事后把所获得的印象条理化。
    我们是早晨七时半离开了哈瓦那的。沿途经过了哈瓦那省北岸的许多有名的海滩：巴古拉纳、爱尔梅加诺、希巴哥阿、阿洛约贝尔梅霍。这些在哈瓦那东部属于“储蓄和住房全国委员会”的建筑以前我们也曾参观过。这些建筑是根据革命政府十三项基本法律之一、1959年2月17日的法律接管的归“储蓄和住房全国委员会”所有的首批建筑。“储蓄和住房全国委员会”在革命前是“全国彩票发行所”。我随身带着作为参考用的土地改革法和另外十二条重要法律的原文。在设立“储蓄和住房全国委员会”的法律的前言中写明：
  “从共和国成立初期起，‘全国彩票发行所’一直是一个为发展恶习、为使政治集团和轮流执政的统治者们发财致富而服务的一个国家机构。这些人靠着担任这个对他们来说是污水沟和不道德的源泉的职位而取得奖金和红利。”
    现在取而代之的是一个自治机构，即上面提到的
  “委员会”，这个委员会的任务是：
    一、使人民把至今放在赌博中的资金储蓄起来。
    二、把能够通过这个计划收集起来的资金和一切可以调动的资金，进行投资，以便彻底解决我国的住房问题，从而消灭国民生活这两个方面的利润和剥削。
    三、使得中等阶层和下层居民也能够得到贷款的好处。
    四、随着这个机构不断实现它的目的，促进其他有利于国计民生的投资。
      “委员会”发行证券以代替过去的彩票发行所的彩票。过去的彩票一个月抽签一次，有十万比索（古巴货币单位，与美元等值）奖一个和一百比索奖一千个。
    我们参观的这些房屋建筑在哈瓦那市郊，宽敞而明亮。据领我们参观的人说，这些房屋是一个以一万幢房屋为基础的住房规划的一部分，并将向内地扩展。
    公路上华丽的汽车很少。这是因为美国通讯社对古巴的歪曲报道，使美国游客大大减少了；另一个原因是古巴革命政府限制华丽汽车的进口。进口华丽汽车曾使古巴成为美国汽车制造公司的最好的市场之一。我的一位同伴说：“菲德尔·卡斯特罗说过，谁想消耗美元买一辆汽车，他就得同时购买一台拖拉机”。
    我们现在来到了位于霍维亚诺斯市的“自由古巴”农业合作社，这里种植花生、甘蔗、菜豆、土豆等作物。这些作物迅速地提供愈来愈大的收益。
    我们同农民们进行广泛的交谈。他们的生活正在改变，他们得到了土地改革法的好处。在古老的、不适宜居住的茅屋附近建立起一幢有卫生设备的舒适住宅。我问一位老年人的平均工资是多少，他说：平均每天三比索，比过去赚的钱多一倍。另外他还可以从人民商店里得到贷款。因此，高利贷再不能压榨他、剥削他了。
    我们跟技术人员谈话，其中的一个人说：革命调动了古巴人力和经济的巨大潜力。农村人民正在紧张地劳动，这不是因为有人迫使他们这样做，而是因为他们看到了劳动的好处。他们提出了许多产品综合利用的倡议。例如，从前人们只是说：“糖，糖，糖”。如今人们从甘蔗中制造人造木（他给我们指了一扇用人造木做的门）和优良的新闻纸。目前甘蔗的副产品已经有十几种以上了。
    在古巴农村，我看到古巴人民日日夜夜地在辛勤劳动。他们知道，必须用自己的力量搞好生产，并且作好准备应付一切意外情况，这样革命的敌人就不能把爪子卡在古巴人民的脖子上。这使我想起了我在哈瓦那到处见到的口号：“使用国货就是爱国！”
    古巴人民非常钦佩苏联和中国的成就，但是他们
  认为古巴的土地改革以及社会领域中所进行的一切改革必须是古巴式的，它的一切将适合国家的特点。举例来说，我在一个合作社听到：“一个诽谤的运动企图把古巴的农业合作社说成是抄袭苏联的集体农庄。不是这样的。我们这里的合作社是按照我们的需要组成的”。
      “古巴化”是经常重复的一句话。在古巴产品首次展览会上，当我们在合作社的一间屋里喝咖啡时，我的一位同伴对我说，菲德尔·卡斯特罗这样说：“我们已经开始提倡要爱我们自己的产品，爱我们的祖国，爱我们所有一切的事物。首先，我们已使得古巴走向古巴化，这虽然似乎是怪论，但古巴过去确实没有古巴化，古巴不是古巴人的古巴”。现在这一切已经随着革命的胜利和发展而一去不复返了。
    在古巴农村正在大力推行合作化运动，现在大约已经组织了近两千个合作社。农民通过合作社将得到必要的技术和经济援助，以便使更大数量的农民参加生产。土地改革法禁止大庄园制度。一个自然人或法人拥有土地的最大面积为三十卡瓦耶里亚（每卡瓦耶里亚等于二百零一点四五中国亩）。在地里工作了五十四年的一个挺秀而壮健的农民伯尼格诺·埃尔南德思对我们说：“以前这里的土地都属于一个主人”。说罢，他用宽的短刀割下一些木瓜请我们吃。他清楚知道，在这个地方一年有几次收成，过去唯一缺少的是技术、深耕细作。今天他们感觉到，他们是为自己的福利，为祖国的富强而劳动。另外一个拿着把短刀的农民对我们说：“如果敌人要来进攻我们，就让他们马上来吧。谁要到这里来夺走我们的短刀，他们就会成为刀下之鬼。”
    在古巴农村中我还看到农民和起义军是团结合作的。军队都在帮助农民劳作。
    每一个合作社有自己的医院，还有一块地方设有人民商店，诊疗所和药房以及包括八个床位的急救医院。军队带给他们药品，并且由一个军医每星期至少到医院来一次作免费诊断。
    后来，我们访问了名为“中澳大利亚洲”的合作社。它原先是西班牙人的产业，是一个大庄园，有许多房间专门用来留宿客人的。院子像一座安达露西亚
  （西班牙地名——译者注）矢车菊（植物名）组成的博物馆。一排房子已经有一百多年的历史了，花园里有各种各样的果树。现在这个地方是集体垦植的中心，用来扩大橘子和鳄梨的生产。
    我们参观了农村里其他社会性的工程后，来到了萨巴德沼泽地。这是一大片直到不久以前还是难于接近和不适合居住的土地。有一大部分资源还没有经过勘察，但是随着“吸干沼泽地的计划”、“农业开发计划”，以及革命政府“旅行事业计划”的实现，它将以真正激动人心的形式改变了旧有的面貌。
    在泥泞地首先建筑起大型公路，然后是一般公路，再就是建立森林与采煤合作社。这个区域都在热火朝天地工作着。显然，他们正同大自然作斗争，用实际行动来粉碎帝国主义关于古巴人是懒惰和悠闲的诬蔑。
    在古巴，各项工作都在快速度进行。旧农村的面貌正在改变，许多古老破烂的小茅屋将逐渐被小城市所代替。菲德尔·卡斯特罗计划在农村中成百成百地建设这样的小城市。小城的大小是不等的。例如，在比那尔德里奥省有一片种有四百六十六公顷烟草的田地，这块地如此肥沃，它通常每年给巴蒂斯塔农业部长彼得罗·麦内德斯带来十五万美元的利润。而今天已成为那些新城市之一的中心。这里有一百二十所房屋。这些房子将在三年内移交给合作社农民作为个人财产。每逢星期天，人们从八十公里以外老远的地方来这里参观。参观的人并不都是农民，但他们想看看在古巴正在发生的变化以分享国家的荣誉。
    目前，古巴的土地改革已经基本结束了，古巴和美国大庄园主的土地已经根据土地改革法征用了。缺地或少地的农民分得了土地，他们劳动热情空前高涨。一面加紧生产，一面参加民兵组织，接受军事训练，随时准备着为保卫革命和保卫土地而战。在古巴农村中我不止一次地看到，背着枪支从事耕作的农民。“誓死保卫祖国！”和“我们必胜！”已经不只是口号，而是古巴人民的实际行动了。有这样的人民，古巴革命是不可战胜的。（附图片）
