    US Bourgeois Newspapers Comment on US Election Results
    Kennedy Will Continue to Pursue a Policy of Arms Expansion and War Preparations
    US Information Service Says Kennedy Will Not Change the Bipartisan Foreign Policy
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) American bourgeois newspapers and news agencies have recently pointed out in their comments on the results of the US election that Kennedy's election as the next US president will not bring about any fundamental changes in US foreign policy.
    On the first day the results of the US election were announced, Associated Press correspondent in Washington, Hightower, reported that "Kennedy is not expected to drastically change US foreign policy based on his campaign speeches." Many commentaries acknowledge that the next Democratic government will still basically pursue the Republican Party's foreign policy. The United States Information Service, the official American propaganda agency, said in a special dispatch that Kennedy is "unlikely to change" the "bipartisan attitude towards foreign affairs" that the United States has adopted since the end of the war, and that "in fact, Kennedy has indicated that he favors appointing Republicans to senior positions in defense and foreign policy."
  The "New York Times" also believes that "on most basic issues," the Democratic and Republican parties' "opinions are largely consistent."
  The "New York Times" also wants the United States' "friends abroad" to rest assured that after Kennedy takes office, "America's goal will continue to be to defend and maintain" the "beliefs" of Western countries together with them and to oppose the "advancement" of the world's communist cause.
    It can be seen from most comments in the American press that, for the benefit of American monopoly capital, Kennedy will work harder than the Eisenhower administration to pursue a policy of arms expansion and war preparations, and expansion and aggression. United Press International reporter Hansley said that "the task facing Kennedy's 'new government'" is to put the "Western world" in a "more active position" in the "relentless struggle" against communism. He said, "Kennedy has indicated that to establish a more effective foreign policy, it must have the following background or foundation: increase US military strength so that the government can express a tougher opinion when dealing with Khrushchev." The Associated Press also reported on the 11th that Kennedy "has always been very certain" about stepping up arms expansion and war preparations to strengthen US military strength, and "his plans include missile programs all the way to reorganizing and reforming the slow-moving Pentagon." The Associated Press also said that Kennedy will vigorously accelerate the development of long-range missiles to "bridge" the missile "gap" with the Soviet Union, while "modernizing ground conventional forces to conduct limited wars in places where nuclear war is not possible."
    When talking about the summit meeting issue, many comments pointed out that Kennedy will still adhere to the US's consistent practice of proceeding from a "position of strength." "New York Post" reporter Shannon said, "Kennedy intends to postpone all negotiations with Russia on the Berlin issue and other issues (except for negotiations on the prohibition of nuclear tests) for as long as possible, until our military strength has recovered to the level he deems appropriate." United Press International also admitted that Kennedy will "no longer seek to deal with Khrushchev at summit meetings" "unless there is prior indication that agreement can be reached on certain issues." Everyone knows that this attitude of setting preconditions for negotiations is actually a tactic used by the Eisenhower administration in the past to obstruct and undermine summit meetings.

    美国资产阶级报刊评美大选结果
    肯尼迪将继续推行扩军备战政策
    美国新闻处说肯尼迪不会改变两党一致外交政策
    本报讯　美国的资产阶级报刊和通讯社最近在评论美国大选结果时纷纷指出，肯尼迪当选下届美国总统，并不会使美国的外交政策发生任何根本的变化。
    在美国大选结果揭晓的头一天，美联社驻华盛顿记者海托华就报道称，“人们预料肯尼迪不会根据他的竞选演说而着手彻底改变美国外交政策”。许多评论都承认，下届民主党政府仍将基本上奉行共和党的对外政策。美国官方宣传机构美国新闻处在一则专电中说，肯尼迪“极少可能改变”美国战后以来“对外交事务所采取的两党一致的态度”，而且“事实上肯尼迪已经表示他赞成任命共和党的人担任国防和外交政策方面的高级职位。”
  “纽约时报”也认为，“在大多数基本问题上”，民主党与共和党的
  “意见在很大程度上是一致的”。
  “纽约时报”并且要美国在“国外的朋友们”放心，肯尼迪上台以后，“美国的目的将继续是同它们一起保卫和维护”西方国家的“信念”，反对世界共产主义事业的
  “推进”。
    从美国报刊的大多数评论中可以看出，为了美国垄断资本的利益，肯尼迪将比艾森豪威尔政府更加卖力地推行扩军备战和扩张侵略政策。合众国际社记者汉斯莱说，肯尼迪“新政府所面临的任务”，是要使“西方世界”在反对共产主义的“无情斗争中处于更主动的地位”。他说，“肯尼迪表明，要确立一项更加有效的外交政策，必须有如下的背景或基础，即增加美国军事力量，使政府在对付赫鲁晓夫时，能够表示更强硬的意见。”美联社在11日也报道称，肯尼迪在加紧扩军备战以加强美国军事力量方面“一直是很肯定的，他的计划包括导弹计划一直到改组和改进行动缓慢的五角大楼的等等计划。”美联社还说，肯尼迪将大力加速发展远程导弹，以“弥合”同苏联之间的导弹“差距”，同时“使地面常规部队现代化，以便在不可能进行核战争的地方进行有限战争”。
    在谈到最高级会议的问题时，许多评论指出，肯尼迪仍将坚持美国过去一贯从“实力地位”出发的做法。“纽约邮报”记者香农说，
  “肯尼迪打算尽可能长久地不同俄国进行关于柏林问题和其他问题的一切谈判（除了关于禁止核试验的谈判以外），一直到我们的军事实力恢复到他认为是适当的水平”。合众国际社也承认，“除非事先有迹象表明能够就某些问题达成协议”，否则肯尼迪将“不再设法在最高级会议上同赫鲁晓夫打交道”。大家知道，这种对谈判提出先决条件的态度，实际上就是艾森豪威尔政府过去用来阻挠和破坏最高级会议的一个手法。
