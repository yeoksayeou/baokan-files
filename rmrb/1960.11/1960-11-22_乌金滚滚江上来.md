　　Black Gold Rolls in from the River

　　At night, while people were asleep, the meeting room of the Yongning Wooden Boat Cooperative in Kai County, Sichuan Province, was still brightly lit. More than sixty cadres from the county's transportation system were intently studying an urgent transportation task – rushing the accumulated thousands of tons of coal from Tulong Port to support steel production. Currently, only 150 tons can be transported each day. How could they complete the task! At the meeting, someone said: "It is our responsibility to transport coal to support steelmaking. We are determined to participate in this campaign!"

　　As soon as the meeting adjourned, everyone busied themselves grabbing tools, putting on straw sandals, and going down to the river to mobilize boatmen to set sail; leading cadres were divided into four shock brigades and went down to the river to direct operations from the boats. A battle to transport coal began.

　　Early in the morning, more than two hundred wooden boats appeared on the river, some in groups of twenty or more, some in groups of several, one boat after another, one group after another, truly a mass of boats setting off together, vying for high output.

　　Zhu Dalun, director of the Kai County Transportation Bureau, personally served as the navigator of a large wooden boat, leading a fleet racing towards Tulong Port. As the fleet entered the "Rotten Boat Nest" shoal, raging currents pounded against the reefs, roaring. This was a notorious dangerous shoal, with steep cliffs above and rolling rapids below. Even veteran boatmen would break into a cold sweat here. However, Director Zhu Dalun, who had long been deeply involved in practical work and was familiar with the waters, led the boatmen in chanting resolute slogans, charging through the rapids.

　　Night fell. The lights along the river were brilliant, dyeing the autumn water red. The new boatman, Xia Shangzhi, suddenly said to Director Zhu: "It's dark, let's stop sailing!" "How can we? For the sake of fifteen hundred tons of coal, we must persevere to the end; be bolder, you go pull the towline, and I'll navigate." In the cold, quiet night sky, only the sound of the navigator directing operations could be heard. The boatmen were full of energy, determined not to stop until they reached Tulong Port. Thus, after more than ten hours of hard work, the fleet successfully reached its destination, breaking the convention of "no night sailing on small rivers."

    乌金滚滚江上来
    夜里当人们熟睡的时候，四川省开县永宁木船社的会议室里，还是一片灯光。全县交通系统的六十多名干部，正在聚精会神地研究一项紧急运输任务——抢运土龙港积存的几千吨煤炭，支援钢铁生产。现在每天只能运一百五十吨，怎么能完成任务呢！会上有人表示：“运煤支援炼钢是我们的责任，我们坚决参加突击！”
    会一散，大家都忙着拿工具，穿草鞋，下河动员船工开航；领导干部分成四个突击大队，全部下河，随船指挥。一场运输煤炭的战斗开始了。
    清晨，河面上出现了二百多只木船，其中有二十多只一组的，有几只一组的，一船接一船，一组挨一组，真是万船齐发，争夺高产。
    开县交通局长朱大伦亲自担任一支大木船的领航员，率领着一个船队，正向土龙港方向急驰。船队驶进“烂船窝”滩，只见急流拍打着礁石，发出咆哮的吼声。这是个有名的险滩，上面是悬岩陡壁，下面是滚滚的急流，多年的老船工到了这里也要出一把冷汗。可是，这位长期深入实际，熟悉水性的局长朱大伦，却率领着船工们喊着坚定的号子，向激流冲了过去。
    夜幕降临了。沿河灯光灿烂，染红了一江秋水。新船工夏尚志突然对朱局长说：“天黑了，停航吧！”“怎么行，为了一千五百吨煤，一定要坚持到底；把胆子放大些，你去拉纤，我来领航。“在冷清清夜空里，只听见领航员指挥操纵的声音，船工们浑身是劲，决心不到土龙港不收兵。这样，经过十多个小时的奋战，船队顺利地到达了目的地，打破了“小河不夜航”的常规。
