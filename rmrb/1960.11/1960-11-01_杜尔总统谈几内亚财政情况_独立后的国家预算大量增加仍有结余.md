Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, October 30th: According to the Guinean News Agency, Guinean President Sékou Touré, in a recent cadre meeting of the National Political Bureau of the Guinean Democratic Party, reported on Guinea's national financial situation before and after independence. He pointed out that Guinea's last budget during the colonial era (1958) was 4.5 billion francs, while Guinea's budget for the first year after independence, 1959, was 7.591 billion francs. This year's budget was not only fully implemented, but also had a surplus of more than 300 million francs.

Touré pointed out that Guinea's budget during the colonial era often had deficits, and the deficits increased year by year. This made it increasingly impossible for institutional bodies to function normally.

Touré continued, Guinea's 1960 budget is over 8 billion. He said that the unanticipated expenses when formulating this year's budget have greatly increased, but this year's budget can still be fully executed.

Touré spoke of the enormous difficulties encountered by the Guinean government in formulating the 1959 national budget, saying: The reason for these difficulties was, on the one hand, that Guinea had to bear the expenses left over from the budgets of the former French West Africa and France, and on the other hand, that the French authorities stubbornly refused to hand over to Guinea the cash that legally belonged to it. Touré said: However, the Guinean government was still able to ensure the normal operation of institutional bodies under such unfavorable financial conditions.

Sékou Touré emphasized that without economic development, there can be no social development; without political freedom, there can be no economic development. Therefore, after gaining political power, economic development must be given priority.

    杜尔总统谈几内亚财政情况
    独立后的国家预算大量增加仍有结余
    新华社科纳克里30日电　据几内亚新闻社报道，几内亚总统塞古·杜尔在几内亚民主党全国政治局最近召开的干部会议上就几内亚独立前后国家财政情况作了报告。他指出，几内亚在殖民地时代的最后一次预算（1958年）为四十五亿法郎，而几内亚独立后第一年即1959年的预算则为七十五亿九千一百万法郎，这一年的预算不仅完全付诸实施，而且还有三亿多法郎的结余。
    杜尔指出，在殖民时代几内亚的预算经常存在赤字，并且赤字逐年增加。这使得体制机构日益不能起正常的作用。
    杜尔继续说，1960年几内亚的预算在八十亿以上。他说，在制订今年预算时未曾估计到的开支大大增加了，但是，今年的预算仍可以完全得到执行。
    杜尔谈到几内亚政府在制订1959年国家预算时所遇到的巨大困难时说：造成这种困难的原因一方面是因为几内亚承担了前法属西非以及法国的预算遗留下来的开支，另方面是因为法国当局顽固地拒绝把依法应属于几内亚的现金提交给几内亚。杜尔说：然而几内亚政府还是能够在这样不利的财政情况下保证体制机构的正常运转。
    塞古·杜尔强调说，没有经济的发展，就不可能有社会的发展；没有政治上的自由，不可能有经济的发展。因此，获得政权以后必须优先地发展经济。
