(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Hebei Daily, the Yongnian County Party Committee organized cadres to start by checking the implementation of the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, helping production teams to formulate measures based on local conditions, focusing on the key task of managing late-planted wheat, striving to have late-planted wheat catch up with early-planted wheat, and weak seedlings catch up with strong seedlings, in order to win a comprehensive bumper harvest next summer.

Yongnian County planted more than 600,000 mu of wheat this year. Due to low rainfall in the summer and autumn, poor soil moisture, and late harvesting of autumn crops, more than 120,000 mu of late-planted wheat were sown. Among them, 14% of the land was not fertilized, 16% of the land had clods, and because of drought, there were many underground pests. In this situation, two situations emerged in the county: Most commune members, in order to help wheat survive the winter, adopted measures such as early watering, early topdressing, early cultivation, and early pest control, based on the growth characteristics of wheat this year, to strengthen the management of late-planted wheat, in order to compensate for the "congenital deficiencies" of wheat seedlings in the early stage; a small number of production teams did not pay enough attention to wheat field management, especially the management of late-planted wheat.

Why did these two situations occur? The Yongnian County Party Committee promptly analyzed and studied this, and believed that the production teams that implemented the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" policy better had better wheat field management and more enthusiasm from the commune members. The individual production teams with poor wheat management mostly had problems in implementing the policy: the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" had not been implemented in the production teams, some had not mobilized commune members to discuss, and some had set production targets that were too high. The County Party Committee believed that managing the 120,000 mu of late-planted wheat was an important issue for winning a comprehensive bumper harvest next year, and that conscientiously implementing the policy and fully utilizing the initiative and enthusiasm of each team was the key to solving this problem. In order to implement the policy well, the County Party Committee organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the production teams, mobilize commune members to conscientiously solve the problems in the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, and implement the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" to the production teams in the spirit of supplementing whatever is lacking. The original production target of Youcun Production Team of Zhoucun Commune was high. After the cadres went down, they immediately assisted the team cadres in finding old farmers for discussion and organizing commune members to discuss. Finally, the production target was revised realistically. In this way, the commune members felt that the goal was clear. As long as they managed the late-planted wheat in advance, it would be possible to achieve overproduction. All 125 households in the team automatically cleared out 364 carts of high-quality manure and quickly applied a topdressing to 140 mu of late-planted wheat.

At present, the management activities of applying additional fertilizer and water to late-planted wheat have been widely carried out among the commune members throughout the county. 63,000 mu of wheat in the county have basically achieved the "Three Universal Applications" (universal watering, universal fertilization, and universal cultivation), including more than 30,000 mu of late-planted wheat and weak seedlings.

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Shaanxi Daily, the Xia Sanmen Lane Production Team of Huazhou Commune in Weinan County, in view of the characteristics of large depletion of soil fertility in wheat fields this year, many return-cropped wheat fields, and late sowing of some wheat fields, promptly carried out activities to prepare early and skillfully apply "full-month fertilizer" to wheat fields, laying a good foundation for a bumper summer harvest next year.

The autumn sowing quality of this production team this year was generally better than in previous years, and the wheat seedlings emerged very neatly. In this situation, a few cadres and commune members developed a blindly optimistic mood, thinking that a bumper summer harvest next year was guaranteed. After the leadership discovered this situation, they immediately conducted research and organized the masses to discuss the autumn sowing work this year, asking if there were any shortcomings in addition to the good aspects, and how to remedy them. After discussion, everyone believed that the wheat fields this year had the following characteristics: First, the soil fertility recovery was insufficient. This year, all the autumn fields of this team were planted against drought, and more than 90% of these autumn fields were replanted with wheat. The land had not been fully weathered and rotted, and the soil fertility had not recovered. Second, most of the return-cropped wheat had insufficient base fertilizer. Third, the autumn crops were harvested late this year, and some of the return-cropped wheat was sown more than ten days after the "Frost's Descent", which had a great impact on the winter tillering of wheat. According to these characteristics, everyone believed that it was necessary to take measures as soon as possible to strengthen the field management of wheat. If they were satisfied with the status quo, it would cause losses later.

Now that the problems have been found, how to manage them? After research, the team cadres and old farmers believed that the current priority was to apply "full-month fertilizer" early and in large quantities. If enough fertilizer is applied, the soil temperature can be maintained, the soil fertility can be enhanced, and the winter tillering and rooting time of wheat can be extended, so as to strive to root well before winter and tiller more.

The team cadres then made a survey of the fertilizer and found that other fertilizers were mostly used in autumn sowing, but the commune members still had a large amount of farm manure at home. These fertilizers were all quick-acting fertilizers suitable for topdressing. It was decided to purchase the commune members' farm manure according to the method of high quality and high price, paying cash for cash, and giving work points for work points. In a few days, this production team received more than 200 large carts of high-quality farm manure, enough to apply "full-month fertilizer" to all the wheat fields in the team once.

After the fertilizer problem was solved, in order to give full play to the fertilizer effect, this production team adopted the method of observing the land, observing the seedlings, and applying fertilizer skillfully according to categories. For the 30 mu of wet land, 2,000 jin of hot barnyard manure were applied per mu to enhance the cold resistance of the seedlings; for the wheat fields that did not have enough base fertilizer during emergency planting, 6,000 jin per mu were supplemented according to the standard; a layer of fine soil fertilizer was generally covered on the wheat fields that had sufficient base fertilizer.

    检查政策执行情况调动社员超包产争丰收的积极性
    永年添肥加水精管晚茬麦
    下三门巷小队看地看苗巧施小麦“满月肥”
    本报讯　据河北日报消息：中共永年县委组织干部从检查“三包一奖”的贯彻执行情况入手，帮助各生产小队因地制宜制定措施，抓住重点偏管晚茬麦，力争晚茬麦赶早茬麦，弱苗赶壮苗，夺取明年夏季全面大丰收。
    永年县今年共种小麦六十多万亩。由于今年夏秋雨少，墒情不好，大秋作物成熟晚收割晚等原因，全县播种了十二万多亩晚茬麦。其中有14％的土地没有施上底肥，16％的土地有坷垃，因为干旱，地下虫害比较多。在这种情况下，全县出现了两种情况：大部分社队的社员为了使小麦过好越冬关，根据今年小麦的生长特点，采取了早浇水、早追肥、早中耕、早治虫等措施，加强了晚茬麦的管理，以弥补麦苗初期的“先天不足”；少数生产队对麦田管理特别是对晚茬麦的管理不够。
    为什么出现这两种情况？中共永年县委对此及时进行了分析研究，认为凡是“三包一奖”政策贯彻得较好的社队，麦田管理就搞得好，社员干劲就足。小麦管理不够好的个别社队，多是在贯彻执行政策当中还有问题：“三包一奖”还没有落实到小队，有的没有发动社员进行讨论，也有的包产指标偏高等。县委认为管好十二万亩晚茬麦是夺取明年全面大丰收的重要问题，而认真贯彻政策，充分发挥各小队的主动性、积极性，又是解决这一问题的关键。为了把政策很好地贯彻下去，县委组织了大批干部，分别深入生产队，发动社员认真解决“三包一奖”中的问题，并本着缺什么补什么的精神，把“三包一奖”落实到小队。周村公社油村生产队原来包产指标较高，下去的干部发现这种情况后，立即协助队干部找老农座谈，组织社员讨论，最后对包产指标实事求是地进行了修改。这样，社员们都觉得奔头明确了，只要提前管好晚茬麦，就有可能实现超产。全队一百二十五户社员自动地清理出三百六十四车质量较高的粪肥，给一百四十亩晚茬麦很快就施了一次追肥。
    目前全县广大社员对晚茬麦偏施肥偏浇水的管理活动已普遍开展起来。全县已有六万三千亩小麦基本上达到三普（普浇水、普施肥、普中耕），其中晚茬麦和弱苗有三万多亩。
    本报讯　据陕西日报消息：渭南县华州公社下三门巷小队，针对今年麦田地力消耗大、回茬麦多、部分麦田播种较迟的特点，及时开展了为麦田早备、巧施“满月肥”的活动，为来年夏田大丰收打好基础。
    这个生产小队今年的秋播质量一般比往年好，麦苗出土很整齐。在这种情况下，少数干部和社员产生了盲目乐观情绪，认为明年夏季大丰收是稳拿了。领导上发现这种情况后，立即进行了研究，并组织群众讨论今年的秋播工作，除了好的一面，还有没有不足之处，以及如何补救的问题。经过讨论，大家认为，今年的麦田有以下几个特点：第一是地力恢复不足。今年这个队的秋田全部抗旱抢种，这些秋田90％以上又回种小麦，土地没有得到充分风化腐熟，地力未恢复过来。第二是大部分回茬麦底肥不足。第三是今年秋庄稼收得迟，有些回茬麦到“霜降”后十来天才下种，对小麦冬前分蘖有很大影响。根据这些特点，大家认为必须及早采取措施，加强小麦田间管理，如果满足现状，就会给以后带来损失。
    问题找出来了，如何管呢？小队干部和老农经过研究，认为当前主要是早施、多施“满月肥”。肥施足了，就可以保持地温，增强地力，延长小麦冬前分蘖、盘根时间，争取冬前盘好根，多分蘖。
    队干部接着对肥料进行摸底，发现其他肥料多在秋播中用了，但社员家里还有大量的家肥，这些肥料都是适合作追肥使用的速效肥，便决定按照优质优价、要现款给现款、要记工分给记工分的办法，收买社员的家肥。几天时间，这个小队就收到优质家肥二百多大车，足够给全小队的麦田施一次“满月肥”。
    肥料问题解决之后，为了充分发挥肥效，这个小队采取了看地、看苗、分类巧施肥的办法，对于三十亩下湿地，每亩追施了两千斤热性圈肥，增强了幼苗抗寒能力；凡因抢种时没有施足底肥的麦田，每亩按六千斤的标准补足；施足了底肥的普遍盖一层细土肥末。（附图片）
