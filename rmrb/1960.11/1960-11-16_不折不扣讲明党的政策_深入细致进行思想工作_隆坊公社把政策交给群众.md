    Unreservedly Explain the Party's Policies, Conduct Thorough and Detailed Ideological Work
    Longfang Commune Entrusts Policies to the Masses
    (Our Dispatch) The Longfang Commune Party Committee of Huangling County, Shaanxi Province, insists on promptly explaining the Party's policies to the masses and conducting meticulous ideological education, so that the Party's policies are truly grasped by the masses.
    In implementing the Party's policies, Longfang Commune first unifies understanding from top to bottom, from within the Party to outside the Party, and from cadres to the masses, layer by layer without exception. This enables all cadres and the masses of the commune to work together with one heart and one mind in accordance with the Party's policies. This year, after the Huangling County Party Committee arranged to expand the area of autumn sowing, cadres at all levels of the commune immediately went to the production teams. Combining the situation of the production teams, they held various meetings to explain the policies, assign tasks, present the situation, raise questions, and mobilize the masses to conduct full discussions, so that the autumn sowing area plan was successfully implemented. Liu Zhengxing, secretary of the Tai Xian Production Team Party Branch, promoted the policy of "more planting, more harvesting" and "high yield, more harvesting" to cadres and the masses in the Cheng Cun Production Brigade. By holding meetings of Party and League members, he spoke extensively about the significance of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, enabling Party and League members to have a correct understanding of the issue. Five Party members, seven League members, cadres, and activists in the entire brigade divided up responsibilities, with each person connecting with several commune members. In the fields, canteens, villages, and roads, they conducted specific propaganda in conjunction with the brigade's situation and the masses' views on expanding the autumn sowing area. The entire brigade had unified thinking, and everyone was full of energy, overfulfilling the autumn sowing task by one hundred mu. Some commune members of the Wawu Village Production Brigade felt that there was a shortage of labor and fertilizer was not keeping up, so they lacked confidence in expanding the autumn sowing area. However, after in-depth and meticulous propaganda and education work, the fertilizer problem was solved, with more base fertilizer than last year; there was also enough labor, with all eighty-seven laborers in the entire brigade mobilized, making the autumn sowing work fast and good.
    When publicizing the Party's policies and conducting ideological work, Longfang Commune pays attention to seeing it through from beginning to end. At the beginning, when the masses did not fully understand the policies, Party organizations at all levels studied the masses' thinking, spoke extensively about the policies, and mobilized the masses. After the masses were mobilized, the main strength of Party organizations at all levels turned to going deep into reality, discovering problems in the implementation of policies, and effectively solving them. For example, after some achievements were made in implementing the Party's instructions on expanding the autumn sowing area, some commune members developed a blindly complacent mood. The Commune Party Committee promptly educated the masses, ensuring the expansion of the autumn sowing area and the quality of autumn sowing work.
    In implementing the Party's policies and conducting ideological work, Longfang Commune also adopts practical methods based on different situations and different objects. Women laborers account for about half of the commune's labor force. The commune attaches great importance to mobilizing women. In order to take care of the characteristics of women, in addition to holding mass meetings, they often use women's meetings, family meetings, and casual chats to carry out propaganda and education work; some elderly people accept new things slowly and often only believe what they see. The Commune Party Committee focuses on educating them with facts.
    The reason why Longfang Commune's ideological education work can be done so thoroughly and meticulously, uniting cadres and the masses around the Party, with one heart and one mind, working hard to forge ahead, and burying themselves in hard work, is mainly because the commune's responsible cadres, headed by Party Committee Secretary Zhang Huaide, can steadfastly implement the Party's policies. No matter how urgent the task, they always insist on the policy coming first. Once the Party's policies are issued, cadres immediately study them and quickly go to the masses to convey and promote them. The masses praised: "Roll up your sleeves and hold your hands tight, we'll go wherever the Party tells us to go, we know the Party's instructions early, and our leaping steps are faster than shooting stars."
    Because the Longfang Commune Party Committee conscientiously implemented the Party's policies and conducted in-depth and meticulous ideological education work among the masses, since 1958, the commune's agricultural production, commune-run industry, animal husbandry, culture, education, and health work have all developed rapidly. It has successively won thirty-nine award banners and certificates from the central government, provinces, special zones, and counties. The special zone and county held nine on-site meetings here to promote their work experience.

    不折不扣讲明党的政策  深入细致进行思想工作
    隆坊公社把政策交给群众
    本报讯　陕西省黄陵县隆坊公社党委坚持向群众及时地讲明党的政策，进行细致的思想教育工作，使党的政策真正为群众所掌握。
    隆坊公社在贯彻党的政策当中，首先从上到下，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，层层统一认识，一层不隔。这样就使全社干部、群众上下一心，按照党的政策办事。今年，中共黄陵县委布置了扩大秋播面积以后，公社各级干部立即深入到各生产队，结合生产队的情况，召开各种会议，讲政策，交任务，摆情况，提问题，发动群众充分进行讨论，使秋播面积计划顺利落实。太贤生产队党支部书记刘正兴，在程村生产小队向干部群众宣传多种多收和高产多收的政策，通过召开党、团员会议，大讲大办农业、大办粮食的意义，使党员、团员对这个问题有了正确认识。全小队五个党员，七个团员、干部、积极分子，分工包干，一个人联系几个社员，在田间、食堂，在村里、路上，结合小队的情况和群众对扩大秋播面积的看法，具体进行宣传，全小队人人思想通，个个干劲足，超额一百亩完成了秋播任务。瓦吾村生产小队一部分社员认为劳力缺，肥料赶不上，对扩大秋播面积信心不足，但是，在进行了深入细致的宣传教育工作以后，肥料问题解决了，底肥比去年还多；劳力也有了，全小队八十七个劳力全部出动，使秋播工作做得又快又好。
    隆坊公社在宣传党的政策，进行思想工作时，注意从始到终，一抓到底。开始当群众对政策还不太理解的时候，各级党组织就研究群众的思想情况，大讲政策，发动群众。当群众发动起来后，各级党组织的主要力量就转向深入实际，发现政策执行中的问题，并切实加以解决。例如，在执行党的关于扩大秋播面积的指示有了一些成绩以后，部分社员产生了盲目自满情绪。公社党委及时对群众进行了教育，才保证了秋播面积的扩大和秋播工作的质量。
    隆坊公社在贯彻党的政策，进行思想工作当中，还根据不同情况，不同对象，采取切合实际的办法。妇女劳力占全公社劳力的一半左右，公社对发动妇女非常重视，为了照顾妇女的特点，每次开展工作，除召开群众会外，还经常采用妇女会和家庭会、拉家常等方式进行宣传教育工作；一些老年人对新东西接受得较慢，常常要亲眼看见才相信，公社党委就着重用事实对他们进行教育。
    隆坊公社思想教育工作所以能作得深入细致，把干部、群众团结在党的周围，一条心一股劲，发愤图强，埋头苦干，主要原因是以党委书记张怀德为首的公社负责干部能够坚定不移地贯彻执行党的政策，不管任务多么紧迫，他们总是坚持政策先行，党的政策一下来，干部立即进行研究，迅速到群众中去传达、推行。群众赞扬说：甩起胳膊握紧手，党叫怎走咱怎走，党的指示早知道，跃进步子赛流星。
    由于隆坊公社党委认真地贯彻了党的政策，对群众进行了深入细致的思想教育工作，这个社1958年以来，农业生产、社办工业、畜牧业、文教卫生等工作都得到了迅速发展，先后获得了中央、省、专区和县的奖旗、奖状三十九面。专区和县在这里开了九次现场会，推广他们的工作经验。
