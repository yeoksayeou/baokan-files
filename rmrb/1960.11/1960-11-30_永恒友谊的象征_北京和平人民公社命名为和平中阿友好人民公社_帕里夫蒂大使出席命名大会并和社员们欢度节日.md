Xinhua News Agency, 29th. More than one thousand commune members of the Peace People's Commune in Chaoyang District, Beijing, gathered solemnly today to celebrate the 16th anniversary of Albania's liberation and the naming of the commune as the Peace Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune.

The Peace Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune was filled with a festive atmosphere today. Decorated archways were erected on the road leading to the commune, and more than a thousand commune members, holding bouquets, gathered early in the morning at the edge of the village, beating gongs and drums, and setting off firecrackers to warmly welcome Albanian Ambassador to China, Parifti, and his wife, Albanian poet Çaci and his wife, as well as the head of the Albanian Acrobatic Troupe, Agolli, and the performers who came to participate in the celebration and naming ceremony.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Ruilong, Deputy Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Qu Wu, President of the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association Jiang Nanxiang, Vice Mayor of Beijing Feng Jiping, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Chang Pu, and others attended the conference.

Vice Mayor Feng Jiping first congratulated the representatives of the heroic Albanian people at the meeting. In his speech, he warmly praised the great achievements made by the Albanian people in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha. He said that the Albanian people have a glorious revolutionary tradition, especially in the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and modern revisionism represented by the Yugoslav Tito clique, being staunch, unyielding, brave, and tenacious, making significant contributions to safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism and the unity of the socialist camp, and to promoting the international communist movement and the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, setting a brilliant example for the revolutionary people of the world. Feng Jiping said that although China and Albania are separated by vast oceans and thousands of miles, the people of the two countries have extremely close, brotherly friendship, and are closely united in the struggle against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and in building socialism. The Chinese people will always work together and fight together with the Albanian people, moving from victory to victory. Feng Jiping then said that the naming of the Peace People's Commune as the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune will further strengthen and develop the close, brotherly friendship between the people of China and Albania.

Ambassador Parifti extended warm congratulations to all the commune members at the meeting and introduced the construction achievements of Albania in the sixteen years since its liberation. He said that the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people is based on immortal Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese people are the loyal friends and comrades of the Albanian people. We should make every effort to strengthen our friendship. The stronger our friendship, the more our enemies will fear us. Under the leadership of Comrades Hoxha and Mao Zedong, the people of our two countries hold high the banner of pure Marxism-Leninism. This banner will always fly high, because it is the banner of invincible socialism and communism, the banner of the liberation of all mankind. Ambassador Parifti also warmly praised the achievements of China's Great Leap Forward. His speech was warmly welcomed by the commune members. After his speech, Ambassador Parifti presented the Peace Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune with a banner inscribed with "Symbol of Eternal Friendship."

Ma Haishui, the First Secretary of the Party Committee of the Peace Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune, congratulated the Albanian people on the holiday on behalf of the 100,000 commune members. He said that it is an honor for all commune members that the name of our commune can be linked with the heroic name of Albania, and it is also a great encouragement to all commune members. We must hold high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, learn from the firm and courageous spirit of the Albanian people, work hard, and strive to make the commune better. After his speech, he presented lacquerware produced by the commune to the Albanian friends.
