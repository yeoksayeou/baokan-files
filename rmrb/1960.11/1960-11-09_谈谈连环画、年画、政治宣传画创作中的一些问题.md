On Some Problems in the Creation of Lianhuanhua (sequential picture stories), New Year Pictures, and Political Propaganda Posters
    Shen Roujian

Lianhuanhua, New Year Pictures, and political propaganda posters are widely popular art forms that have extensive and close connections with the people in our socialist cultural life. They reflect the struggles of our great era and the new face of people's lives in popular art forms that are loved by the masses. Our Lianhuanhua, New Year Pictures, and political propaganda posters have implemented the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving the socialist cause, and the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new. Both creation and publication have greatly improved and developed. The extensive influence of these art forms among the people of our country can be seen from the hundreds of millions of works published in Beijing and Shanghai alone in recent years. In addition, the Lianhuanhua creation in Liaoning, the propaganda poster creation in Tianjin, and the New Year picture creation in Hubei, Shandong, Guangdong and other places also have their own characteristics. The folk woodcut New Year pictures in Weifang, Shandong, have also been inherited and developed under the policy of weeding through the old to bring forth the new, and have achieved remarkable results in using traditional art forms to express the themes of real-life struggles.

The creation of these three art forms is unprecedentedly prosperous, and many excellent works have emerged, such as the Lianhuanhua "Chicken Feather Letter" (Liu Jiyou), "Fifteen Strings of Cash" (Wang Hongli), "Child Labor" (Zhou Li, Wang Xuyang, etc.), "Reconnaissance Across the River" (Gu Bingxin), "The Great Change of Changshi" (Ding Binzeng, Han Heping, Zhang Dajing), "The Fury of Miaoshan" (Wang Zhongqing), "Railway Guerrilla" (Han Heping, Ding Binzeng); New Year Pictures "Zhao Guilan at the Heroes Conference" (Lin Gang), "Mom Can Go to Production with Peace of Mind" (Zhang Leping), "Winter Melon Goes to High Buildings" (Jin Meisheng), "Pulling Radishes" (Te Wei), "Eagle Catches Chicken" (Li Mubai); political propaganda posters "Advance Along the Socialist Road" (Jiang Zhaohe), "Armed Intervention Cannot Scare the People Who Strive for Independence" (Zhang Ruji), "Working Together, Sharing the Fruits" (Cai Zhenhua), "Strive for Greater Harvests, Dedicated to Socialism" (Qian Daxin), "Long Live Chairman Mao" (Ha Qiongwen), "More Pigs, More Fertilizer, Higher Grain Yield" (Yang Wenxiu), etc., have all been widely circulated and praised by the masses.

Here, taking Shanghai, which I am more familiar with, as an example, I will talk about the creation of Lianhuanhua, New Year Pictures and political propaganda posters, and some issues.

	Lianhuanhua Must Reflect Our
		Great Era

Since the founding of the country, the progress and development of Lianhuanhua has been enormous. It has fully played the special function of combining the plot of literature and the visual image of painting, widely reflecting the themes of real life and revolutionary history. It is a vivid and powerful tool for conducting communist moral education for the broad masses of the working people and children. Many excellent Lianhuanhua works have become good teachers and helpful friends to the broad readers. Many works have directly played an active role among readers. For example, after the Young Pioneers of Luxing Primary School in Xiangcheng Township, Wuxian County, Jiangsu, read the Lianhuanhua "Chicken Feather Letter," they were inspired to automatically organize a communications team. They worked conscientiously and were praised by the county party committee. The Lianhuanhua "Nobody Accepted the Good News" published in Shanghai is a story about the great collaboration of three shifts in the first open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1. After its publication, it greatly encouraged the workers of the factory. Later, the collaboration of these three shifts slackened somewhat, affecting the quality of products, and the red flag was lost. When the branch conducted education, they also used the Lianhuanhua "Nobody Accepted the Good News" to ask the workers to take another look. The three furnace chiefs were very moved and each examined their shortcomings, expressing their determination to regain the red flag. Finally, they created a new steelmaking record and regained the red flag. The painters then compiled and drew the Lianhuanhua "The Lost and Regained Red Flag" based on this life plot.

In recent years, the two-line struggle of Lianhuanhua has mainly revolved around important issues such as whether Lianhuanhua should reflect socialist life and how to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. Before 1958, there were still phenomena of valuing the ancient and worshipping the foreign, and compiling whatever was available regardless of good or bad. After criticism, the phenomenon of being divorced from politics, divorced from the masses, and divorced from life was basically overcome. The purpose of serving whom became clear, and the combat effectiveness of Lianhuanhua was strengthened. Going to life and going to struggle to compile and draw has become a positive requirement for the authors themselves. For example, the authors who painted "Railway Guerrilla," "Tracks in the Snowy Forest," and "Great Changes in the Mountain Village" all went to the places where the stories took place to conduct investigations and research. After the painters had feelings and understanding of actual life, and a deeper understanding of the theme and characters and environment of the script itself, the depiction of the image was more profound and moving, and had a sense of reality. Sometimes the compiler and the painter went deep into the actual struggle together to carry out compilation and creation, and the effect was also very good. For example, the "Old Sun Returns to the Cooperative" published in 1953 is an example. The recently published "The Great Change of Changshi" is a result of the close combination of the authors and the masses under the specific guidance of the Changshi People's Commune Party Committee. Because the authors were encouraged by moving deeds in actual life and supported and helped by cadres and the masses, they produced a creative enthusiasm to express these deeds profoundly. As the authors themselves said: "In the days of the Changshi People's Commune in Guizhou, our hearts could not be calm and we were excited; we were creating, but also being educated; it not only opened a new page in our creative life, but also made us improve a step in political thought." After the first draft was completed, it was repeatedly revised in the joint study with the masses and cadres of the commune. After the final draft, the masses of the commune said: "We would have solved so many problems if we had this book earlier for everyone to study! You should publish the book quickly, we must buy a few more copies, not only to read ourselves, but also to leave it to our children and grandchildren so they can see how we came here." From this, we can see how eagerly the masses hope that art creation can closely reflect their actual struggle, and how welcome the masses are to these works that reflect the real struggle. Of course, compiling and creating in actual life, and relying closely on the local party committee and the local masses, although not the only method, should be regarded as an important aspect.

In recent years, the creation and publication of Lianhuanhua has adopted a variety of forms such as wall charts and series of books, which are very popular with the masses. For example, to cooperate with political propaganda tasks, compile and draw wall charts in the form of Lianhuanhua for the masses to post anytime and anywhere, which is easy to penetrate deeply. Some Lianhuanhua adopt the form of a series of books, which can systematize and plan the publication of books.

Lianhuanhua must deeply reflect the new spiritual outlook of our great era in many ways, and better make it a powerful tool for the Party to conduct communist ideological education and popularize cultural and scientific knowledge to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and children. Therefore, the adaptation of literary scripts must start from the principle of "political standard first" and be strictly selected. Oppose politically and ideologically harmful works. In the creation of Lianhuanhua, we must continue to overcome crude manufacturing and the influence of Europeanization, and strive to carry forward the national style of Lianhuanhua, so that the content and form of Lianhuanhua are more abundant and perfect. Therefore, Lianhuanhua should pay attention to continuous improvement on the basis of a large number of popularization. There should be a part of key works in the annual creation plan to promote improvement in popularization. In recent years, Lianhuanhua artists have seriously studied and researched the Chinese national painting tradition, which is a good phenomenon. In addition to drawing essence from the early Lianhuanhua and embroidered image illustration editions and other heritage, they must also absorb nourishment from national and folk paintings such as Chinese paintings, murals, and woodcut New Year pictures to create more new and more beautiful Lianhuanhua works. Mr. Lu Xun predicted that Lianhuanhua could produce Da Vinci and Michelangelo, and this prediction can only be realized in our era. More importantly, we must greatly exceed them, and we will certainly be able to exceed them.

	Create New National Style New Year Pictures

New Year pictures are a unique art form in our country. They are a traditional art form that expresses the good wishes of the working people and enhances the festive atmosphere of the New Year, and has long been rooted and developed in the lives of the working people in our country.

Various new New Year picture creations have been continuously enriched and improved on the basis of carrying forward the excellent traditions of folk New Year pictures and liberated area New Year pictures, with wide themes and diverse forms. New Year picture artists and other painters have given full play to their good expressive techniques, absorbed and carried forward the excellent traditions of folk New Year pictures, and created many New Year picture works that sing the praises of the new things of the great era and reflect revolutionary historical events with different styles, which have produced a profound impact among the readers and the masses.

"Monthly Calendar" New Year pictures are a New Year picture form in Shanghai. Its painting style is generally meticulous, with bright colors, and is readily accepted by workers and peasants. It accounts for a large proportion of the various New Year pictures published in Shanghai. Before liberation, "Monthly Calendar" New Year pictures mainly served capitalist commercial advertisements. Except for a few good works, most of them were used as tools to promote the bourgeois way of life. After liberation, under the guidance of the Party's literary and artistic policy, based on the principle of gradually improving and improving on the basis of carrying forward the excellent traditions of New Year picture art, we have strived to overcome some of the past bad influences and have begun to embark on a healthy development path, making the "Monthly Calendar" New Year pictures a new look.

To develop "Monthly Calendar" New Year pictures, we must improve and improve the creation of "Monthly Calendar" New Year pictures, but the authors are generally unfamiliar with or have certain limitations in expressing new life and new characters. Therefore, we should often organize learning and timely summarize creative experience. The excellent traditions or advantages of "Monthly Calendar" New Year pictures should be given clear affirmation, such as the traditional painting style of Monthly Calendar New Year pictures has the characteristics of "auspicious, lively, bright, and gorgeous" that the working people require of New Year pictures. As for the problems of expressing the life and image of the working people unnatural, or still inevitably having some residual influence of capitalist commercial advertising paintings, we still need to go deep into the life of the masses to seek thorough improvement and improvement.

Since the Great Leap Forward, authors have generally gone deep into the life of the masses. While going deep into life or labor training, they have held art exhibitions, collected mass opinions, and conducted investigations and research, and have gained many gains in ideology and creation. In the life of the masses, ideological emotions have changed, aesthetic views have also changed, and creative ability has also improved. The opinions of the masses have also played a positive role in promoting creation, enabling authors to realize how they should strive to enrich the source of creation and change their ideological emotions and lifestyles by going deep into the masses. Folk songs and mass art creation with the spirit of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism have also inspired "Monthly Calendar" New Year pictures a lot. For example, excellent works such as "Winter Melon Goes to High Buildings" were produced on the basis of going deep into the life of the masses.

According to historical records, New Year pictures in our country have a history of nearly a thousand years. Woodcut printed New Year pictures have been popular and developed among the people since the Northern Song Dynasty, and have extremely rich excellent traditions. Moreover, folk New Year pictures in various regions have their own local characteristics. For a period of time, there was a phenomenon of neglecting the content and traditional forms of New Year pictures in the creation and publication of new New Year pictures. It was thought that there were no so-called traditional characteristics of New Year pictures. All kinds of paintings printed for pasting during the Spring Festival could be called "New Year pictures." Facts have proved that some works that do not have the characteristics of New Year pictures, lack content, have monotonous pictures, and have dull colors are not in line with the wishes of the masses. Our New Year picture creation today should take expressing the new era of life and reflecting revolutionary ideals as the main creative content, and also create new styles on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the excellent traditions of folk New Year pictures. The traditional characteristics of New Year pictures are inseparable from the ideological emotions and aesthetic habits of the working people in our country. In the past, folk New Year pictures from the working people often expressed the people's beautiful wishes with romantic techniques. The integrity of the art form and the enthusiasm and brightness of the colors are determined by its specific content and festive requirements. Today, the content and form of New Year pictures should better reflect the working people's yearning for a more beautiful life and their optimistic fighting will, and actively increase the joyful atmosphere of the New Year to meet the new needs of the masses. An art form that has been formed for a long time and is loved by the broad masses reflects the aesthetic views and preferences of the people, so the study and learning tradition and the creation of new national styles first require understanding and familiarity with the ideological emotions of the masses. The clear lines and enthusiastic and bright colors of folk woodcut New Year pictures mutually set off in strong contrast, achieving a harmonious and bright effect. These traditional expressive techniques are also useful for us to express new life content today. Our new New Year pictures should pay attention to drawing the essence from the tradition of folk New Year pictures. At the same time, we cannot ignore the learning and application of foreign painting techniques. After dissolving, we can create a new national style. The folk New Year picture heritage in various regions of our country is very rich and should also be sorted out and studied, removing the dross and selecting the essence, so as to create new New Year pictures with local characteristics.

	Political Propaganda Posters Are the Party's Propaganda
		A Powerful Tool for Arousing Enthusiasm

Political propaganda posters are one of the Party's powerful tools for propaganda and mobilization, and its combat role is increasingly showing in the socialist revolution and construction. The creation of political propaganda posters, except in general circumstances, needs to be timely and closely coordinated with the needs of political movements and struggles.

In the past, there were still phenomena of detachment between creation and political tasks and movements, as well as the shortcomings of ideological poverty, generalization, and imitation of foreign countries. Since the Great Leap Forward, the quantity and quality of propaganda poster creation have increased and improved significantly. Especially as the ideological emotions of the authors in the life of the masses have become closer to the working people, and attention has been paid to the study of excellent national and folk painting traditions, many propaganda posters with strong combat effectiveness and a distinct national style have emerged. For example, "Strive for Greater Harvests, Dedicated to Socialism" and "More Pigs, More Fertilizer, Higher Grain Yield" have these characteristics. At present, propaganda poster artists are still working hard to create our nation's unique propaganda poster style.

Propaganda posters closely coordinate with the current political tasks, and must timely promote the Party's policies through vivid painting images, promote communist ideas, reflect the heroic spirit and ambition of the people in the actual struggle of socialist revolution and construction, and inspire the people to build a modern industrial, modern agricultural, and modern scientific and cultural socialist power. In every stage of revolutionary development, our political propaganda posters are a battle drum that summons the masses to move forward in the direction indicated by the Party. Therefore, in order to strengthen political propaganda posters to better coordinate with political tasks, more widely reflect the struggle of life, and create works with profound content and novel style that people never get tired of seeing, it is necessary to further strengthen the profound ideology of the works and give full play to the special function of propaganda posters. In order to achieve the positive effect of propaganda and mobilization, the theme of the work must be prominent, the image must be vivid, concise and clear, and have generality and strong appeal. Many of our excellent propaganda posters have this effect. × × ×

Under the glorious illumination of the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the creation of Lianhuanhua, New Year pictures, and political propaganda posters in our country is constantly moving forward and developing along the Party's literary and artistic line. The tremendous achievements that have been obtained have powerfully proved the unparalleled correctness of the direction of our revolutionary art "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers" and "improving on the basis of popularization and popularizing under the guidance of improvement." Lianhuanhua and New Year pictures are the unique art forms of our country that have been enriched and perfected under the leadership of the Party and widely serve the workers, peasants, soldiers, and the socialist cause; political propaganda posters are the fighting art weapons we use for revolutionary propaganda and mobilization. They occupy a very important position on the socialist art front. These art forms, which have the widest connection with the people, have become tools to inspire the people to struggle for the realization of socialism and communism by widely reflecting the glorious and splendid reality of socialism in our country. At the same time, they are also sharp fighting weapons against imperialism.

An important task of our art creation is to help the people thoroughly eliminate the political influence and ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, actively cultivate people's communist spiritual qualities, and whether our works can be competent for this task fundamentally depends on the continuous transformation of the worldview of the painter itself and the industrialization of ideological emotions. Our Lianhuanhua artists, New Year picture artists, and political propaganda poster artists must also constantly hone and improve their artistic expression skills. In order to meet the growing cultural needs of the people and constantly adapt to the improvement of the audience's and readers' appreciation level, these art forms should produce more first-class painters and first-class works, and at the same time, we must establish a unique art system of Lianhuanhua, New Year pictures, and political propaganda posters in our country to radiate splendor to the world of culture and art.

    谈谈连环画、年画、政治宣传画创作中的一些问题
    沈柔坚
    连环画、年画、政治宣传画是普及很广的画种，在我国社会主义文化生活中，与人民群众有广泛、密切的联系。它们以通俗的、为群众所喜闻乐见的艺术形式，反映了我们伟大时代的斗争和人民生活的新面貌。我国的连环画、年画、政治宣传画贯彻了为工农兵服务，为社会主义事业服务的方向和百花齐放，推陈出新的方针，无论创作和出版都有很大的提高和发展。仅从北京、上海近年来出版的数以亿计的作品，也可看出这些画种在我国人民群众中的广大影响。此外，如辽宁的连环画创作，天津的宣传画创作，以及湖北、山东、广东等地的年画创作也都各有特色。山东潍坊的民间木版年画在推陈出新的方针下也得到了继承和发扬，运用传统的艺术形式，表现现实生活斗争的题材，取得了显著的成绩。
    这三个画种的创作空前繁荣，出现了许多优秀的作品，如连环画《鸡毛信》（刘继卣），《十五贯》（王弘力），《童工》（周立、王绪阳等），《渡江侦察记》（顾炳鑫），《长石的巨变》（丁斌曾、韩和平、张大经），《苗山怒火》（王仲清），《铁道游击队》（韩和平、丁斌曾）；年画《群英会上的赵桂兰》（林岗），《妈妈安心去生产》（张乐平），《冬瓜上高楼》（金梅生），《拔萝卜》（特伟），《老鹰捉小鸡》（李慕白）；政治宣传画《沿着社会主义道路前进》（蒋兆和），《武装干涉吓不倒争取独立的人民》（张汝济），《共同劳动，共享成果》（蔡振华），《争取更大的丰收，献给社会主义》（钱大昕），《毛主席万岁》（哈琼文），《猪多肥多粮产高》（杨文秀）等等都得到广泛流传和群众的好评。
    这里，仅就我比较熟悉的上海为例，谈谈连环画、年画和政治宣传画创作的情况和一些问题。
    连环画必须反映我们
          伟大的时代
    建国以来，连环画的进步和发展是十分巨大的。它充分发挥了文学的故事情节和绘画的视觉形象相结合的特殊功能，广泛地反映了现实生活和革命历史的题材，是对广大劳动人民和少年儿童进行共产主义道德教育的生动有力的工具。许多优秀的连环画作品已成为广大读者的良师益友。不少作品都在读者中直接起了积极的作用，如江苏吴县湘城乡陆行小学的少先队员看了《鸡毛信》的连环画后，受到启发，自动组织通讯队，工作认真，受到县委表扬。上海出版的连环画《没人接受的喜报》，是描写上钢第一转炉车间三个班大协作的故事，出版后对该厂的工人鼓舞作用很大。后来这三个班的协作有些松弛，影响产品质量，红旗丢了，支部进行教育时还拿连环画《没人接受的喜报》要工人们再看看，三个炉长很受感动，各自检查了缺点，表示决心夺回红旗，终于又创造了炼钢新纪录，夺回了红旗。画家们又根据这段生活情节，编绘了连环画《失而复得的红旗》。
    近几年来，连环画的两条道路斗争，主要的是围绕着连环画要不要反映社会主义生活和如何为工农兵服务等重要问题进行的。在1958年以前，还存在着厚古崇洋和不分好坏有啥编啥的现象。经过批判以后，基本上克服了脱离政治，脱离群众，脱离生活的现象，为谁服务的目的性明确了，连环画的战斗性加强了，到生活中、到斗争中去编去画，成为作者本身的一种积极要求。如画《铁道游击队》、《林海雪原》、《山乡巨变》等的作者，都曾经到故事发生的所在地去作调查研究。画家对实际生活有了感受和了解，对脚本本身的主题思想和人物、环境，有了较深切的体会之后，形象的刻划也就比较深刻动人，具有真实感。有时编者和画家一起深入实际斗争，进行编写和创作，效果也很好。如1953年出版的《老孙归社》，便是一例。不久前出版的《长石的巨变》，是在长石人民公社党委具体指导下，作者和群众紧密结合而取得的成果。由于作者们在实际生活中受到动人事迹的鼓舞和干部群众的支持帮助，产生了一种非把这些事迹深刻地表现出来不可的创作热情。正如作者们自己所说：“在贵州长石人民公社的日子里，我们的心情无法平静，激动不已；我们是创作，也是受教育；它不仅翻开了我们创作生活中新的一页，也使我们在政治思想上提高了一步。”初稿完成后在和公社群众、干部共同研究中，又一再作了修改。定稿以后，公社的群众说：“早有这本书，让我们大家学习，要解决多少问题啊！你们快出书吧，我们一定要多买几本，不仅自己看，还要留给儿孙看，让他们看看我们是怎样走过来的。”从这里我们可以看出群众是多么热切地希望美术创作能够密切地反映他们的实际斗争，而这些反映现实斗争的作品，群众又是多么的欢迎。当然，在实际生活中编写、创作，紧紧依靠当地党委和当地群众，这虽不是唯一的方法，但应当作为一个重要的方面来看。
    近年来，连环画创作和出版采用挂图、丛书等多种多样的形式，颇受群众欢迎。如配合政治宣传任务，以连环画形式编绘挂图，供群众随时随地张贴，容易深入。有的连环画采用丛书形式可以使出书系统化和更有计划性。
    连环画必须从多方面深刻地反映我们伟大时代的新的精神面貌，更好地使它成为党对广大工农群众和少年儿童进行共产主义思想教育和普及文化科学知识的有力工具。所以改编文学脚本须从“政治标准第一”的原则出发，严格地加以选择。反对政治上和思想上有害的作品。在连环画创作中，必须继续克服粗制滥造和欧化的影响，努力发扬连环画的民族风格，使连环画的内容和形式都更加丰富完美。所以，连环画在大量普及的基础上还要注意不断提高，在每年创作计划中应有一部分重点作品，使在普及中起促进提高的作用。近几年来连环画家对中国民族绘画传统认真学习和研究是好现象，除了在早期的连环画和绣像插图刻本等遗产中吸取精华外，还要从民族和民间绘画如中国画、壁画和木版年画等传统中吸取养料，以创造出更多更新更美的连环画作品。鲁迅先生曾预言连环画可以产生达·芬奇和米开朗基罗，这预言只有在我们的时代中才可以实现。更重要的是我们要大大地超过他们，而且一定能超过他们。
    创造民族新风格的年画
    年画是我国特有的画种，它是表达劳动人民美好愿望和增进年节欢乐气氛的传统的艺术形式，长久在我国劳动人民生活中生根发展。
    各种新的年画创作在发扬民间年画和解放区年画优良传统的基础上，不断得到了丰富和提高，题材广泛，形式多样。年画家和其他画家们，各发挥自己擅长的表现技法，吸取和发扬民间年画优良传统，创作了许多歌颂伟大时代新事物的和反映革命历史事迹的而风格又各不相同的年画作品，在读者群众中都产生了深刻的影响。
      “月份牌”年画是上海地方的一种年画形式，其画风一般描绘细致，色彩鲜艳，工农群众乐于接受。在上海出版的各种年画中，它占很大的比重。解放前，“月份牌”年画主要是为资本主义商业广告服务的，除部分较好的作品外，大都是被利用作为宣扬资产阶级生活方式的工具。解放后，在党的文艺方针的指引下，根据在发扬年画艺术优良传统的基础上逐步改进提高的原则，努力克服了过去某些不良的影响，开始走上了健康的发展道路，使“月份牌”年画面目一新。
    要发展“月份牌”年画就必须改进和提高“月份牌”年画的创作，但作者对表现新的生活新的人物一般都不熟悉或有一定的局限。因此，应经常组织学习和及时总结创作经验。对“月份牌”年画优良传统或优点应给以明确的肯定，如月份牌年画的传统画风具备着劳动人民所要求于年画的“吉利、热闹、鲜明、富丽”等特色。至于表现劳动人民的生活和形象不自然，或者还难免有些资本主义商业广告画的残余影响等问题，还须深入群众生活去求得彻底的改进和提高。
    大跃进以来，作者们普遍深入群众生活，在深入生活或劳动锻炼的同时，举行作品展览，收集群众意见，进行调查研究，思想上创作上都有许多收获。在群众生活中，思想感情变了，审美观点也有改变，创作能力也有提高。群众的意见对创作也起了积极的鞭策作用，使作者们注意到应如何努力在深入群众中去充实创作源泉和改变自己的思想感情和生活方式。具有革命现实主义和革命浪漫主义精神的民歌和群众美术创作对“月份牌”年画也有很多启发。如《冬瓜上高楼》等优秀作品，就是在深入群众生活的根基上产生的。
    我国年画，据历史记载可考的便有近千年的历史，木版印刷的年画自北宋以后便在民间普遍流行发展，有着极其丰富的优良传统，而且各地区的民间年画都各具自己的地方特色。有一个时期，在新年画创作和出版上曾有忽视年画内容和传统形式的现象，认为无所谓年画的传统特点，只要印给春节张贴的各式各样的画都可以叫“年画”。事实证明，某些不具备年画特色的内容贫乏、画面单调、色彩灰暗的作品是不合群众的心意的。我们今天的年画创作，要以表现新的时代生活，反映革命的理想作为主要的创作内容，并且还要在继承和发扬民间年画优良传统的基础上创造新的风格。年画的传统特色与我国劳动人民的思想感情和审美习惯是分不开的。过去来自劳动人民的民间年画，往往以浪漫主义的手法表现人民的美好愿望。艺术形式的完整性和色彩的热烈鲜明，又是由它的特定的内容和节日要求所决定的。今天年画的内容和形式更应该体现出劳动人民对更加美好生活的向往和乐观的战斗意志，积极增进年节的愉快气氛，以满足群众新的需要。一种长久形成的为广大群众所喜闻乐见的艺术形式，它反映了人民群众的审美观和爱好，所以研究和学习传统，创造新的民族风格，首先就需要了解和熟悉群众的思想感情。民间木版年画的明确的线条，热烈明快的色彩，在强烈的对比中互相反衬，达到和谐鲜明的效果，这些传统的表现手法，对我们今天表现新的生活内容也都是有用的。我们的新年画应该注意从民间年画传统中吸取精华，同时，也不能忽视外来的绘画技法的学习和运用，经过溶化，创造出民族的新风格。我国各地区的民间年画遗产十分丰富，也应加以整理研究，去芜存菁，从而创造出新的具有地方特色的年画。
  政治宣传画是党的宣传
      鼓动的有力工具
    政治宣传画是党的宣传鼓动的有力工具之一，在社会主义革命和建设中日益显出它的战斗作用。政治宣传画的创作除一般情况外，需要及时紧密地配合政治运动和斗争的需要。
    过去，还不免存在创作与政治任务和运动脱节的现象，以及思想贫乏、一般化和模仿外国的缺点。大跃进以来，宣传画创作的数量质量都有显著的增长和提高。特别是随着作者们在群众生活中思想感情和劳动人民日渐贴近，并注意到对民族民间优秀绘画传统的学习，因而出现了不少具有强烈战斗性和鲜明民族风格的宣传画。如《争取更大丰收，献给社会主义》和《猪多、肥多、粮产高》等作品，都具有这样的特色。目前，宣传画家们还正在为创造我们民族的独特的宣传画风格而努力。
    宣传画紧密地配合当前的政治任务，必须及时地通过鲜明的绘画形象宣传党的政策，宣传共产主义的思想，反映人们在社会主义革命和建设的实际斗争中的豪迈气概和雄心壮志，激励人民为建立一个现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国而战斗。在各个革命发展阶段中，我们的政治宣传画都是召唤群众向着党所指示的方向前进的一面战鼓，因此，为了加强政治宣传画更好地配合政治任务，更广泛地反映生活斗争，创作出内容深刻、风格新颖，使人百看不厌的作品，还需要进一步加强作品深刻的思想性和充分发挥宣传画的特殊功能。为了达到宣传鼓动的积极效果，作品的主题思想必须突出，形象生动，简洁明朗，富有概括性和强烈的吸引力。我们不少优秀的宣传画就具有这样的效果。×　　　× 　　×
    我国的连环画、年画和政治宣传画创作在毛泽东思想旗帜的光辉照耀下，沿着党的文艺路线不断前进不断发展。从已获得的巨大成就中，有力地证明了我国革命艺术“为工农兵服务”、“在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及”的方向的无比正确。连环画、年画是在党的领导下丰富完备起来的，为工农兵、为社会主义事业广泛服务的我国独有特色的画种；政治宣传画则是我们进行革命宣传鼓动的战斗的艺术武器。它们在社会主义美术战线上占着很重要的地位。这些与人民群众联系最广的画种在广泛反映我国社会主义的光辉灿烂的现实生活中，已成为激励人民群众为实现社会主义、共产主义而斗争的工具，同时，也是反对帝国主义的锐利的战斗武器。
    我们艺术创作的重要任务是帮助人民群众彻底清除资产阶级的政治影响和思想影响，积极培养人们的共产主义的精神品质，我们的作品能否胜任这个任务，基本关键是决定于画家本身的世界观的不断改造和思想感情工农化。我们的连环画家、年画家和政治宣传画家还要不断磨炼提高自己的艺术表现技巧，为了满足人民群众日益增长的文化生活的需要，和不断适应观众和读者欣赏水平的提高，这些画种都应该更多地产生第一流的画家和第一流的作品，同时必须建立我国的连环画、年画和政治宣传画的独特的艺术体系，为世界文化艺术放射异彩。
