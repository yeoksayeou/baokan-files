Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd, Sydney dispatch: Australian Communist Party organizations and laboring people in various regions held mass meetings, reports, dinners, and other activities to warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Australian Communist Party.

Yesterday, a grand rally was held in the Sydney Trades Hall to celebrate the Party's birthday. Laurie Aarons, a member of the Political Bureau of the Australian Communist Party, said at the meeting that the Australian Communist Party has made great progress. He said, "We are faced with huge tasks and struggles. With the support of the working class, we will win peace, democracy and socialism."

Aarons called on the working class to combine the celebration of the Party's birthday with further promoting the struggle against the Menzies government's fascist criminal law amendments. He pointed out that the main purpose of the criminal law amendments is to promote imperialist and colonialist policies and stifle freedom of speech. He said that the emergence of a national situation in Australia today against the fascist criminal law amendments is entirely the result of the leadership of the Australian Communist Party.

It is reported that Sydney dockworkers conducted a week-long celebration. Communists there held an exhibition of Party history and published a mimeographed special issue. Every day, a leader of the Australian Communist Party spoke at a rally attended by dockworkers.

In Perth in Western Australia, Adelaide in South Australia, and important industrial cities in New South Wales, many non-Party trade union workers attended dinners to celebrate the Party's birthday. Brisbane, Queensland, staged a program introducing the history of the Australian Communist Party. The Queensland State Committee of the Australian Communist Party republished the State Committee's publication, "Tribune Weekly," which had been discontinued four years ago.

It is reported that in the future, the Australian Communist Party will continue to hold dozens of meetings to explain the Party's policies, so as to combine this celebration of the Party's birthday with Party building work.

    澳大利亚劳动人民集会
    热烈庆祝澳共成立四十周年
    阿隆号召把庆祝活动和反对刑法修正案的斗争结合起来
    新华社3日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚共产党各地组织和劳动人民举行群众大会，报告会，聚餐会等，热烈庆祝澳大利亚共产党成立四十周年。
    昨天，为庆祝党的生日在悉尼工会大楼大厅举行了盛大的集会。澳大利亚共产党政治局委员阿隆在会上说，澳大利亚共产党已经取得巨大的进展。他说，“我们面临着巨大的任务和斗争。在工人阶级的支持下我们将赢得和平、民主和社会主义”。
    阿隆号召工人阶级把庆祝党的生日和进一步推进反对孟席斯政府的法西斯刑法修正案的斗争结合起来。他指出，刑法修正案的主要目的是推行帝国主义和殖民主义政策，扼杀言论自由。他说，今天在澳大利亚全国出现反对法西斯刑法修正案的形势完全是由于澳大利亚共产党领导的结果。
    据报道，悉尼码头工人进行了一星期的庆祝活动。那里的共产党员举办了党史展览会，出版了油印专刊。每天有一位澳大利亚共产党的领导人在码头工人参加的集会上讲话。
    西澳大利亚的佩思、南澳大利亚的阿得雷德和新南威尔士的重要工业城市，许多非党工会工作者出席了为庆祝党的生日的聚餐会。昆士兰的布里斯班演出了介绍澳大利亚共产党的历史的节目。澳大利亚共产党昆士兰州委员会重新出版了四年前停刊的州委员会的刊物——“前卫周刊”。
    据报道，今后，澳大利亚共产党还将继续举行几十个会议，说明党的政策，使这次庆祝党的生日的活动和建党工作结合起来。
