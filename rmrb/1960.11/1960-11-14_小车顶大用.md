Small Cart, Big Use
Li Xiushan, First Secretary of the CCP Hebei Zunhua County Jianming People's Commune Committee

Under the leadership of the Party Committee at the higher level, our commune overcame a severe drought rarely seen in decades this year, and the harvest of agricultural and sideline products was greater than in any previous year. To win a bumper harvest next year, this year's autumn plowing, autumn planting, and fertilizer transportation tasks have also greatly increased compared to previous years. Therefore, transportation work in agricultural production is busier than in previous years. However, this year's transportation tasks have been completed better than in the past. Autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting have also been completed better and faster than in previous years. One important reason for this is that light rubber-wheeled handcarts have demonstrated their power, and small carts have been put to great use.

At present, rural people's communes do not have many modern transportation tools, and many things are still carried by people on their backs, shoulders, or by lifting with poles. Therefore, the labor force used for field transportation and short-distance transportation generally accounts for a considerable proportion of the total labor force of the commune, and most of them are relatively strong laborers. How to accelerate the technical transformation of rural transportation is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Solving this problem well can not only better complete the ever-increasing rural transportation tasks, but also save a lot of labor from the transportation sector to enrich the front line of agricultural production. How to solve this problem? Some people advocate buying more cars and tractors. If possible, of course, we should increase the number of cars and tractors. The output of modern transportation tools in our country is also constantly growing, but it is still difficult to meet the needs of all communes at once. Starting from our current specific conditions, solving the problem of rural transportation must also adopt the method of "walking on two legs." Rubber-wheeled handcarts are a very important type of simple transportation tool in rural areas. Compared with modern transportation tools such as tractors and cars, handcarts are relatively backward, but compared to carrying by shoulder or hand, they are more advanced. Rubber-wheeled handcarts are divided into two types: two-wheeled and single-wheeled. They are simple to manufacture and do not cost much. As long as there are ball bearings and rubber wheels, the iron and wood factories of general communes can manufacture and install them. However, their effect is much greater than carrying by shoulder or hand. According to our experience, a two-wheeled handcart can generally carry four to five hundred catties, and if pulled by a small donkey, it can carry seven hundred catties; a single-wheeled cart can also carry two to three hundred catties. They increase work efficiency by three to four times to seven to eight times compared to carrying by hand or back. Compared with horse-drawn carts, rubber-wheeled handcarts are generally not as capable of carrying as much, but in many aspects, they are more convenient than horse-drawn carts. For example, when pulling soybeans in autumn or transporting wheat straw in summer, these things are bulky and light in weight, and large carts cannot load enough weight, so their potential cannot be fully utilized, but small carts can be fully loaded. In this case, a rubber-wheeled handcart can be equivalent to a large cart. The cost of manufacturing a single-wheeled cart is less than one hundred yuan, and the cost of a two-wheeled cart is less than two hundred yuan, which is only one-twentieth to one-tenth of the cost of a large rubber-wheeled horse-drawn cart. At the same time, handcarts can be used in plains, mountains, or hilly areas. Single-wheeled handcarts only need a small path to be used, and they are light and flexible to use. They can undertake most or all of the tasks of field transportation and short-distance transportation.

Our commune Party Committee, adapting to the growing needs of agricultural transportation, adhering to the spirit of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large and small, based on the characteristics of mountainous areas and local farm work, on the one hand, tried to increase large and small modern transportation tools, and on the other hand, vigorously developed handcarts. The Commune Party Committee first organized more than 20 skilled craftsmen to rush to manufacture a batch of handcarts, and focused on promoting them in the Xipu Village production team, making a model, and then promptly summed up experience, organized visits, and promoted them throughout the commune. In less than three months, the entire commune manufactured more than 700 handcarts, which were quickly promoted to various production teams. In order to strengthen the repair work of the carts and extend their lifespan, the Commune Party Committee also organized eight technicians to go to the countryside for inspection and repair.

Since last winter, with the strong support of the industrial sector, our commune has added 737 rubber-wheeled handcarts in addition to a part of cars and tractors. These handcarts have played a significant role in agricultural production. According to statistics, with these handcarts, it is equivalent to increasing more than 1,000 laborers and more than 500 livestock. During the autumn harvest, the transportation volume of handcarts accounted for more than 35% of the total transportation volume, and basically eliminated the phenomenon of people carrying and donkeys驮 in previous years, ensuring that 80% of the labor force in the entire commune was concentrated on the front line of production, which effectively promoted the continued leap forward in agriculture. Because small handcarts accomplished big things, some commune members compiled ditties to praise them: Handcarts are really good, they can run on big roads and small roads, they load a lot, transport quickly, save money, save effort, and are highly efficient; they free up labor to engage in production, ensuring a bumper harvest is a treasure!

    小车顶大用
    中共河北遵化县建明人民公社委员会第一书记　李岫山
    我们公社在上级党委的领导下，今年战胜了几十年来少有的大旱灾，农副产品的收获量比以往任何一年都多；为了夺取明年的丰收，今年的秋耕、秋种、运肥等任务也都比往年大大增加。因此，农业生产方面的运输工作比往年更为繁忙。可是，今年的运输任务比过去完成得都好。秋收、秋耕、秋种等各项工作也比往年完成得又好、又快。其中一个重要的原因就是：轻便胶轮手推车发挥了威力，小车顶了大用。
    目前，农村人民公社现代化的运输工具还不多，许多东西还由人力背、扛、抬、挑，因此，用于田间运输和短途运输的劳动力一般都在公社总劳动力中占相当大的比重，而且多数是比较强壮的劳动力。如何加速实现农村运输的技术改造，是一个迫切需要解决的问题。这个问题解决得好，不但可以更好地完成日益增长的农村运输任务，而且可以从运输方面节省出大量劳动力充实农业生产第一线。怎样解决这一问题呢？有人主张多买汽车、拖拉机。在可能的情况下，当然要增加汽车、拖拉机。我国现代化运输工具的产量也在不断增长，但是一下还难以满足所有公社的需要。从我们当前的具体条件出发，解决农村运输问题也必须采取“两条腿走路”的办法。胶轮手推车就是农村简易运输工具中很重要的一种。手推车比起拖拉机、汽车等现代化的运输工具，是比较落后，但比肩挑人抬，它又是比较先进的。手推胶轮车分双轮和单轮两种。制造简单，花钱不多，只要有了滚珠、胶轮，一般公社的铁木厂都能制造安装。它的作用却比肩挑人抬大得多。根据我们的经验，双轮手推车一般能运四、五百斤，如用一头小毛驴拉可运七百斤；单轮车也能运二、三百斤。它们比人抬、人背提高工效三、四倍到七、八倍。手推胶轮车同马拉大车比较，虽然一般不如马拉大车拉得多，但是，在不少方面它却比马拉大车方便。比如秋天拉豆子，夏天运麦秸，这些东西体积大，重量轻，大车不能装足份量，潜力不能全部发挥，小车却可以满载。在这种情况下，一辆胶轮手推车就可以顶一辆大车。而制造一辆单轮车不到一百元，一辆双轮车不到二百元，造价只相当于大胶轮马车的二十分之一到十分之一。同时，手推车不论平原、山区或丘陵地带都能使用，独轮手推车只要有条小道就行，使用起来轻便灵活。它可以把田间运输和短途运输的大部或全部任务承担起来。
    我们公社党委适应农业运输日益增长的需要，本着土洋结合，大小结合的精神，根据山区和当地农活的特点，一面设法增加大型和小型的现代化运输工具，一面大搞手推车。公社党委首先组织了二十多个能工巧匠，突击制造了一批手推车，在西铺村生产队重点推广，作出样子，然后及时总结经验，组织参观，在全社普遍推广。不到三个月，全社就制造了七百多辆手推车，迅速推广到各个生产队。为了加强小车的修理工作，延长小车的寿命，公社党委还组织了八名技术工人，下乡巡回检查修配。
    从去年冬季以来，我们公社在工业部门的大力支援下，除增加了一部分汽车、拖拉机以外，还增加了七百三十七辆胶轮手推车。这些手推车在农业生产上发挥了很大的作用。据统计，有了这些手推车，等于增加了一千多名劳动力、五百多头牲畜。在秋收当中，手推车运输量占总运输量的35％以上，并且基本上消灭了往年人担、驴驮的现象，保证全社80％的劳动力集中到生产第一线，有力地促进了农业的继续跃进。由于小手推车顶了大事，有的社员编顺口溜歌颂说：手推车，真是好，大路小路都能跑，装的多，运的快，省钱省力效率高；腾出劳力搞生产，保证丰收是一宝。（附图片）
