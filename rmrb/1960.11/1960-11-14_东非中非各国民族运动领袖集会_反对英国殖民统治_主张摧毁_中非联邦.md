    Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Kampala: According to the "Uganda Argus," the Pan-African Freedom Movement of East and Central Africa recently held its annual meeting, demanding the immediate dismantling of the so-called "Central African Federation" cobbled together by Britain.

    The annual meeting was held from October 24th to 26th in Mbale, eastern Uganda. Leaders of several national movements from East and Central Africa attended the meeting, which adopted nine resolutions.

    In the resolution regarding Central Africa, the meeting requested that the members of the movement dedicate all their material and moral strength to the immediate destruction of the "Central African Federation," and expressed opposition to the "Monckton Commission" established by Britain to maintain the "Federation," or any other "report" or "committee" aimed at revising the "Federation."

    In a resolution regarding military bases in Africa, the meeting unconditionally condemned and rejected the proposition of establishing such bases in Africa.

    In a resolution regarding the Congo issue, the Pan-African Freedom Movement of East and Central Africa expressed its unreserved support for the legitimate Lumumba government of the Congo.

    In another resolution, the meeting strongly condemned tribalism in Uganda, emphasizing that Buganda is an indivisible part of Uganda. The resolution expressed its willingness to provide moral support, and if necessary, also material support, to the nationalist forces in Uganda.

    The meeting resolved to demand the immediate release of Kenyan national movement leader Jomo Kenyatta, who is still being detained by the British colonial authorities, and demanded that the South African authorities release the imprisoned African leaders. The Pan-African Freedom Movement of East and Central Africa was established in September 1958. It is an organization that unites the nationalist movements of East and Central Africa.

    主张摧毁“中非联邦”
    新华社10日讯　坎帕拉消息：据“乌干达守卫报”报道，东非和中非泛非自由运动最近举行的年会，要求立即摧毁英国拼凑的所谓“中非联邦”。
    这次年会是从10月24日到26日在乌干达东部的姆巴尔举行的。有东非和中非各国一些民族运动领袖出席的这次会议通过了九项决议。
    会议在关于中非的决议中，要求这个运动的成员把它们的一切物质和道义力量用于立即摧毁“中非联邦”，并表示反对英国为了保持这个“联邦”而成立的“蒙克顿委员会”或其它目的在于修改这个“联邦”的“报告”或“委员会”。
    会议在一项关于非洲的军事基地的决议中，无条件地谴责和拒绝在非洲建立这种基地的主张。
    在关于刚果问题的决议中，东非和中非泛非自由运动表示毫无保留地支持刚果卢蒙巴合法政府。
    会议在另一项决议中强烈地谴责乌干达部族主义势力，强调布干达是乌干达不可分割的一部分：决议表示要给予乌干达民族主义力量以道义的支持，如果必要还有物质的支持。
    会议决议要求立即释放仍被英国殖民当局拘禁着的怯尼亚民族运动领袖乔莫·肯雅塔，要求南非当局释放仍被监禁的非洲人领袖。东非和中非泛非自由运动是在1958年9月成立的。它是一个把东非和中非各国民族主义运动联合在一起的组织。
