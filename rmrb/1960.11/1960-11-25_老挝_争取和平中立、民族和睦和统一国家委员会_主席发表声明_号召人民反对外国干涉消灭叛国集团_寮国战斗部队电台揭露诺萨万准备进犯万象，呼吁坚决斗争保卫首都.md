Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 24th: According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio today, Phoui Sananikone, Chairman of the Lao "National Committee for Achieving Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and a Unified Nation," issued a statement in Vientiane on the 21st, strongly condemning foreign interventionists for interfering in Lao internal affairs and supporting traitorous groups in undermining Lao unity. He endorsed the joint communiqué issued by the delegation of the Royal Lao Government and the delegation of the Lao Patriotic Front, and called on the Lao people to unite, oppose foreign interference, and eliminate traitorous groups.

The statement said that after the formation of the Souvanna Phouma government, it announced that Laos would pursue a policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony. The people of the whole country expressed their support for this and hoped for lasting peace in the country. However, the so-called "Revolutionary Committee," acting on the orders of foreign interventionists, betrayed the motherland, opposed the legitimate Phouma government, betrayed the King and the Constitution, provoked civil war, and made Laotians kill each other in an attempt to restore their dictatorial rule.

The statement continued, "Under the instigation of foreign interventionists and with their assistance in various aspects, the traitorous group seized power in Xieng Khouang city and the Plaine des Jarres on October 8, 1960, and seized power in Luang Prabang city on November 11, 1960. The purpose of this subversive activity by the traitorous group is to split the motherland, control the King, and force the King to form a puppet government in order to create favorable conditions for foreign aid to the Lao traitorous group and further interference in Laos."

The statement said that in the face of the above-mentioned crisis in Laos, the "National Committee for Achieving Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and a Unified Nation" issued the following statement:

"(1) Sternly condemn to the people of the whole country and the people of the world the act of foreign interference in Lao internal affairs and the traitorous group's undermining of the motherland. (2) Only recognize the Phouma government as the only legitimate government. (3) Support Prime Minister Phouma's statement regarding the non-recognition of any decisions made by the King under the coercion of the traitorous group. (4) Endorse the joint communiqué issued by the delegation of the Royal Government and the delegation of the Lao Patriotic Front on November 17."

The statement called on the patriotic monks, members of the royal family, government members, parliamentarians, staff, military, police, youth, students, industrialists, businessmen, workers, farmers, and people of all strata and ethnic groups in Laos to unite, oppose foreign interference, eliminate traitorous groups, safeguard the legitimate Phouma government, and promote Laos to follow the path of peaceful neutrality and get rid of the current crisis. The statement said that especially the garrison, police, and people of the capital Vientiane, who have a fighting spirit, must be vigilant against the divisive conspiracies of foreign interventionists and traitorous groups, and more resolutely defend the capital Vientiane.

The statement also called on the people, garrison, and police of Luang Prabang City, who have a strong patriotic spirit, to unite to oppose the traitorous group, save the King, and liberate Luang Prabang City from the control of the traitorous group.

The statement also called on the Phouma government to adopt a more resolute attitude to oppose foreign interference and to accept aid from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China as soon as possible.

The statement called on the governments and people of all peace-loving countries in the world to support and assist the Lao people's just struggle to defend national independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 23rd: The Radio Station of the Lao Fighting Forces published a commentary today, revealing that the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group is stepping up preparations for a new armed offensive against Vientiane, and calling on the people of Vientiane to resolutely smash this conspiracy.

The radio station said that the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary army is currently divided into two groups. The first group is gathering in the area north of Paksane, and the other group is preparing to advance along the Mekong River in order to cooperate with the army under the command of Captain Siho, a reactionary officer of this group who has been stationed in Thailand waiting for orders for several months.

The radio station also pointed out that the Thai reactionary group is concentrating the boats of the people in preparation for providing facilities for the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group to advance into Vientiane.

The radio station pointed out that while stepping up preparations for the offensive, the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group also sent pawns to infiltrate Vientiane to carry out activities of sabotage, slander, and alienation of patriotic forces.

The radio station emphasized that the above situation proves that the Lao capital Vientiane and the legitimate government are under serious threat. The radio station said, "Our urgent task is to resolutely struggle to defend the capital Vientiane, defend the legitimate government, defend the achievements of the coup, and defend the policy of peace and neutrality of the Lao nation."

The radio station called on all officers and soldiers and the people of Vientiane to strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and be ready at any time to smash the armed offensive of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group and the conspiracy to alienate the internal unity of the patriotic forces. The radio station also called on the people to help the government, monitor and stop the sabotage activities of the pawns of the traitorous group who infiltrated Vientiane.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 23rd: According to a broadcast by the Radio Station of the Lao Fighting Forces on the 21st, the conference of women of all ethnic groups recently held in Wang Ban Township, Luang Prabang Province, unanimously expressed their support for the Phouma government and the National Committee for Achieving Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and a Unified Nation, closely united with the people of the whole country, and fought against the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group together with the coup committee and the Lao Patriotic Front, so that Laos would follow the path of true peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and a unified nation, and the motherland would achieve peace.

    声明说，梭发那·富马政府成立后宣布老挝奉行和平中立、民族和睦政策，全国人民对此表示拥护，并希望国家长久安宁。但是，所谓
  “革命委员会”执行外国干涉者的命令，背叛祖国，反对合法的富马政府，背叛国王、宪法，挑起内战，使老挝人自相残杀，企图恢复他们的独裁统治。
    声明接着说，“在外国干涉者的指使和他们在各方面的帮助下，叛国集团在1960年10月8日抢夺了川圹市和查尔平原的政权，1960年11月11日又抢夺了琅勃拉邦市的政权。叛国集团这种颠复活动的目的是分裂祖国，控制国王，并逼迫国王成立傀儡政府，以便为外国援助老挝叛国集团和进一步干涉老挝创造有利条件。”

    “（一）向全国人民和全世界人民严厉谴责外国干涉老挝内政和叛国集团破坏祖国的行为。（二）只承认富马政府是唯一合法的政府。（三）支持富马首相关于不承认国王在叛国集团挟持下作出的任何决定的声明。（四）拥护王国政府代表团和老挝爱国战线党代表团11月17日发表的谈判联合公报。”
    声明号召老挝爱国的僧侣、皇族人士、政府成员、议员、职员、军队、警察、青年、学生、工商业者、工人、农民等各阶层、各民族人民团结起来，反对外国的干涉，消灭叛国集团，维护合法的富马政府，促使老挝遵循和平中立的道路，摆脱目前的危机。声明说，特别是具有战斗精神的首都万象驻军、警察和人民必须对外国干涉者和叛国集团的离间阴谋提高警惕，更加坚决地保卫首都万象。
    声明还号召具有强烈的爱国精神的琅勃拉邦市人民、驻军和警察，团结起来反对叛国集团，拯救国王，把琅勃拉邦市从叛国集团的控制下解放出来。
    声明还呼吁富马政府采取更坚决的态度以反对外国的干涉，尽快地接受苏联和中华人民共和国的援助。
    声明呼吁世界上一切爱好和平的国家的政府和人民支持和援助老挝人民保卫民族独立的正义斗争。
    新华社河内23日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天发表评论，揭露富米·诺萨万叛国集团正在加紧准备向万象进行新的武装进攻，并号召万象人民坚决粉碎这种阴谋。
    这家电台说，富米·诺萨万反动军队目前正在分成两批，第一批在北卡定以北地区集结，另一批准备沿湄公河沿岸进军，以便同几个月来驻在泰国待命的这个集团的反动军官西何大尉指挥下的军队配合。
    电台还指出，泰国反动集团正在集中老百姓的船只，准备为富米·诺萨万叛国集团向万象的进军提供便利条件。
    电台指出，富米·诺萨万叛国集团在加紧准备进攻的同时，还派遣爪牙潜入万象，进行破坏、诬蔑和离间爱国力量的活动。
    电台强调说，上述情况证明老挝首都万象和合法政府正在受到严重的威胁。电台说，“我们迫切的任务是坚决斗争，保卫首都万象，保卫合法政府，保卫政变的成果，保卫老挝民族的和平中立政策。”
    电台号召全体官兵和万象人民加强团结，提高警惕，随时作好准备，粉碎富米·诺萨万叛国集团的武装进攻和离间爱国力量内部团结的阴谋。电台还号召人民帮助政府，监视和阻止潜入万象的叛国集团爪牙的破坏活动。
    新华社河内23日电　据寮国战斗部队电台21日广播：最近在琅勃拉邦省旺班乡召开的各族妇女会议，一致表示支持富马政府和争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会，同全国人民紧密团结，并同政变委员会和老挝爱国战线党一道对富米·诺萨万叛国集团进行斗争，从而使老挝遵循着真正的和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的道路前进，使祖国获得安宁。
