    Streetcars That “Fly” in the Sky
    Leng Jie

    What will future urban transportation look like? Here, let's talk about streetcars first. When you mention them, you think of their swaying gait and the harsh noise they make while running, the newly built roads ruined by the violent vibrations... Although they have contributed to urban transportation, some of our cities have replaced them with trolleybuses. Can we improve them further? Some Soviet transportation experts have recently proposed a new design to make streetcars "fly" in the sky. They suggest installing the wheels on top of the car body and suspending the streetcar from an elevated track.

    Have you seen the overhead cranes in factory workshops? It's similar to that. First, erect "T"-shaped pillars tens of meters high on the ground, radiating to the four corners of the suburbs like high-voltage power poles. I-shaped steel rails are erected on both ends of the pillar's crossbeam. A silver gleaming streetcar speeds along, passing over people's heads, unimpeded by intersections and obstacles, unaffected by wind or rain, traveling "green lights" all the way to the distance. Its body is made of special plastic, plexiglass, and aluminum, making it very light. One locomotive can tow several or a dozen carriages, becoming an aerial streetcar "train." Its general speed is 100 kilometers per hour, and each carriage is tens of meters long, able to hold hundreds of passengers at once. If powered by an internal combustion engine, its speed on long-distance lines can even reach over 400 kilometers per hour, surpassing even trains with a safe operating speed of 160 to 180 kilometers per hour.

    Is the high-speed aerial streetcar safe? We don't have to worry about that. On the lower wing sides of the I-shaped steel rail, there are two pneumatic tire wheels that are close to the track walls, and the car body is suspended above them. On the upper layer, there are two more pneumatic tire wheels that diagonally support the steel rail, like four "pliers" clamping the track. A large pneumatic tire wheel is vertically installed under the steel rail and connected to the motor. This is the working wheel, which slides along the track during travel, like an arrow shot from a bow. A group of five wheels ensures the streetcar has good stability. The friction sound between the pneumatic tire wheels and the rails is extremely small during travel, and it will not disturb the city's tranquility in the slightest.

    在天上“飞行”的电车
    冷洁
    未来的城市交通工具将是什么样呢？在这里，先要谈谈有轨电车。提起它，就会想起那一步三摇的姿态，行走中伴着刺耳的噪音，新修的道路被剧烈的震动毁坏了……。虽然它曾为城市交通立过功，但我们有些城市还是用无轨电车代替了它的工作。能不能再改进一步呢？苏联一些交通专家们在最近提出了新的设计方案，让电车在天上“飞行”。他们建议把车轮安在车厢上面，电车悬挂在空中的铁轨上行驶。
    你见过工厂车间里的天车吗？它就和它类似。先在地面上竖起几十米高的“T”字形支柱，像高压电杆那样放射到城郊四方。支柱横梁上的两端，架起了工字形的钢轨。一列银光闪闪的电车疾驶而来，掠过人们的头顶，沿途不受交叉路口和障碍物的限制，风雨无阻，一路“绿灯”地驶向远方。它的车身是用特殊的塑料、有机玻璃和铝制成的，重量很轻，一辆机车头能拖曳几个或十几个车厢，成为空中电车“列车”。它的一般行驶速度就是一小时一百公里，每辆车厢长达几十米，一下子能装满几百个乘客。如果换用内燃机为动力，它在长途线路上的速度甚至达到每小时四百公里以上，就连每小时安全驶速有一百六十到一百八十公里的火车也追不上它。
    以高速度行驶的空中电车是否安全？这不要我们担心。在工字形钢轨下翼两侧安有两个贴紧轨壁的汽胎轮，车厢就悬挂在上面。靠上一层另有两个汽胎轮斜顶住钢轨，它们像四把“钳子”卡住了轨道。一个大汽胎轮垂直安在钢轨下面，同电动机连结，这个是工作轮，行驶时就靠它沿轨道滑行，就像一支箭脱弦而去。一组五个车轮保证电车有良好的稳定性，行驶中汽胎轮和铁轨的摩擦声音极小，丝毫不会侵扰城市的安宁。
