    Inner Mongolia Writes "The Primitive Social Form of the Ewenki People" and "A Concise History of the Mongolian People"
    Recently, relevant research institutions and universities in Inner Mongolia, under the leadership of the local Party committee, collectively wrote the first drafts of two books, "The Primitive Social Form of the Ewenki People" and "A Concise History of the Mongolian People."
    "The Primitive Social Form of the Ewenki People" was mainly compiled by comrades from the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences based on survey materials of the Ewenki people who hunt and live along the Ergun River in Inner Mongolia. In addition, they also appropriately used survey materials of other Ewenki people and the Oroqen people, who have historical ties with the Ewenki people. The book is approximately 150,000 words long and is divided into five chapters and seventeen sections, with an appendix.
    The compilers of this book attempt to accurately reflect the primitive social features and development laws of the Ewenki people, provide direct materials for the study of the history of the Ewenki people, and contribute to the study of the history of other ethnic minorities and the ancient social history of our country. Moreover, since the Ewenki people have long been in the stage of primitive social development, but today, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, are directly transitioning to socialism and preparing conditions for future transition to communism, studying their current social form will also help them solve the problem of how to transition to socialism and communism.
    "A Concise History of the Mongolian People" was collectively compiled by relevant units, mainly the Institute of History of the Inner Mongolia Branch, under the guidance of the Institute of History and the Institute of Ethnology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The compilers attempt to use Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong to accurately reflect the historical conditions of the Mongolian people in various stages of social development, the long-standing political, economic, and cultural relations between the Mongolian people and other fraternal ethnic groups in the country, especially the Mongolian and Han nationalities, and the great contributions of the Mongolian people to the creation of the motherland's big family, etc.
    This book focuses on the modern and contemporary history of the Mongolian people, and a large number of literature materials were referenced and utilized during the compilation. The book is approximately 150,000 words long.

    内蒙古写出《鄂温克人的原始社会形态》和《蒙古族简史》
    最近，内蒙古的有关研究机构和高等学校，在当地党委的领导下，用集体力量写出了《鄂温克人的原始社会形态》和《蒙古族简史》两部书的初稿。
    《鄂温克人的原始社会形态》是中国科学院内蒙古分院的同志们主要根据游猎于内蒙古额尔古纳河畔的鄂温克人的调查材料编写的。此外，他们也适当地利用了其他部分的鄂温克人以及与鄂温克人有历史渊源的鄂伦春人的调查材料。全书约十五万字，共分五章十七节，另有附录一篇。
    这部书的编写者试图正确地反映鄂温克人的原始社会面貌及其发展规律，为研究鄂温克人的历史提供直接材料，而且有助于对于其他少数民族历史和我国古代社会历史的研究。又由于鄂温克人虽长期处于原始社会发展阶段，但今天正在党和毛主席的正确领导下，直接向社会主义过渡并准备条件将来向共产主义过渡，所以研究他们现在所处的社会形态，对于帮助他们解决如何向社会主义和共产主义过渡的问题，也将会有所帮助。
    《蒙古族简史》是在中国科学院历史研究所和民族研究所的指导下，以内蒙古分院历史研究所为主，组织了有关单位集体编写的。编写者试图运用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，正确地反映蒙古族在各个社会发展阶段的历史状况，蒙古族与国内其他兄弟民族特别是蒙汉两族的政治、经济和文化的悠久关系，以及蒙族对缔造祖国大家庭的伟大贡献，等等。
    这部书以蒙古族近代、现代史为编写重点，编写时曾参考和利用了大量的文献资料。全书约十五万字。
