The No. 1 Coal Mining Area of Xie’er Mine in Huainan Coal Mine has adopted various methods to help production group leaders improve their leadership skills, enabling all forty-three production groups in the area to universally reach advanced levels. Since September, each group has broken new production quotas, overproducing more than three thousand tons of coal.

The primary measure taken by the No. 1 Coal Mining Area of Xie’er Mine to help production group leaders improve their leadership levels and working abilities is to help them establish a comprehensive understanding of production leadership and to learn the skills to manage production comprehensively. Area leaders and group leaders jointly researched and formulated the scope of responsibilities for group leaders, clearly stipulating that group leaders must focus on ideology, quality, output, attendance, safety, and welfare. They also organized group leaders to study the regulations regarding the scope of responsibilities for group leaders and posted these regulations in places where group leaders frequently meet, so that group leaders could see the work they needed to do every day and keep it firmly in mind. Group leader Chen Kaifu used to only manage the group's underground production and not care about the attendance of workers in the group. After clarifying the scope of responsibilities for group leaders, he frequently paid attention to conducting political and ideological education for workers, which rapidly increased the group's attendance rate by 10%, and the group's daily output exceeded the plan by eighteen tons of coal. Workers in Ma Hengfu's group used to only focus on speeding up coal mining progress, neglecting coal mining engineering standards, which frequently led to rework and affected production. After group leader Ma Hengfu realized that grasping engineering standards was his responsibility, he immediately implemented an acceptance system, ensuring that every prop and support met the standards, eliminating rework and waste. To help group leaders comprehensively manage production, this coal mining area also established three group leaders as models, organizing all production group leaders in the area to carry out activities to learn from and catch up with the models, and the leadership level of the group leaders was universally improved.

The second measure taken to help group leaders improve their leadership level is to hold a district-wide group leader meeting every two weeks to summarize and exchange the working experiences of advanced groups. Advanced working methods from many production groups in the area have quickly become common working methods for all production groups through these exchanges. After coal mining group leader Zhang Lankuan adopted the method of formulating group covenants to transform the tasks assigned by higher authorities into the conscious actions of each worker, all production group leaders in the area universally learned from Zhang Lankuan's experience, powerfully promoting the improvement of production levels. Area leaders also frequently invite group leaders to participate in squad and team leader meetings, organizing group leaders to learn from the experience of squad and team leaders in leading production. After group leader Lu Xinyu learned some working methods from advanced squad and team leaders, he promptly adjusted the labor organization, vigorously shortened transportation distances, and freed up one-third of the labor force to invest in coal mining, increasing coal production by four hundred and fifty tons in October.

The area's leaders also frequently go deep into backward groups to help improve their leadership methods. Many backward groups in the area have quickly transformed into advanced groups after receiving in-depth and specific assistance from leaders. Wang Lifu's coal mining group frequently failed to complete production tasks. After receiving specific assistance from area leaders, production rose sharply, and the coal production in October exceeded the plan by more than double.

    帮助小组长提高领导水平
    淮南谢二矿采煤一区生产小组普遍赶上先进
    本报讯　淮南煤矿谢二矿采煤一区领导采取多种办法，帮助生产小组长提高领导能力，使全区四十三个生产小组普遍达到了先进水平，9月份以来组组突破生产新定额，超产煤炭三千多吨。
    谢二矿采煤一区帮助生产小组长提高领导水平和工作能力的首要措施，是帮助生产小组长树立全面领导生产的思想并学会全面抓生产的本领。区领导干部和小组长共同研究制订了小组长的职责范围，明确规定了小组长必须抓思想、抓质量、抓产量、抓出勤、抓安全、抓生活，并组织小组长学习了小组长职责范围的规定；还把这个规定公布在小组长经常开会的地方，使小组长天天看到自己要做的工作，牢牢记在心上。小组长陈开富，原来只管小组井下生产，不管组内工人的出勤。经过明确小组长的职责范围以后，他经常注意对工人进行政治思想教育，使全组出勤率迅速提高10％，全组日产量比计划超过十八吨煤炭。马恒富小组工人原来只注意加快采煤进度，忽视采煤工程规格，经常返工，影响生产。小组长马恒富认识到抓工程规格是自己的责任后，立即执行验收制度，做到了棚棚支架符合规格，消灭了返工浪费现象。这个采煤区为了帮助小组长全面抓生产，还树立了三个小组长为标兵，组织全区生产小组长开展了学标兵、赶标兵的活动，小组长的领导水平得到了普遍的提高。
    帮助小组长提高领导水平的第二个措施，是每两个星期举行一次全区小组长会议，总结和交流先进小组的工作经验。全区许多生产小组的先进工作方法，经过交流，已迅速成为所有生产小组的普遍工作方法。采煤小组长张兰宽采用制订小组公约的方法，把上级交给的任务变成每个工人的自觉行动以后，全区所有的生产小组长普遍学习张兰宽的经验，有力地促进了生产水平的提高。采煤区领导上还经常吸收小组长参加班、队长会议，组织小组长学习班、队长领导生产的经验。小组长路新雨学习先进班、队长的一些工作方法后，及时调整劳动组织，大力缩短运输距离，腾出三分之一的劳动力投入采煤，10月份增产四百五十吨煤炭。
    这个区的领导干部还经常深入后进小组，帮助改进那里的领导方法。全区不少后进小组，经过领导干部深入具体的帮助，很快转变为先进。王立富采煤小组经常完不成生产任务，经过区领导干部的具体帮助，生产直线上升，10月份产煤量超过计划一倍以上。
