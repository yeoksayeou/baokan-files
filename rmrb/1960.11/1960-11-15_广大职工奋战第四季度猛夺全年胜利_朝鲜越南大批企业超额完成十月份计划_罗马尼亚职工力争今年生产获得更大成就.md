Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 14th: The Korean Central News Agency reported that factories and enterprises under the Heavy Industry Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea completed 101.2% of their October production plan.

    Factories and enterprises in the electricity, ferrous metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, chemical, pharmaceutical, cement, and other industrial sectors have all completed their October production plans. The output of heavy industrial products increased by 7.8% in October compared to September, with iron ore, siderite, steel, steel products, motors, and lathes increasing by 10% to 61% compared to September. The output of major mining machinery increased by two to five times.
    In October, various machinery manufacturing factories produced dozens of different trial products, such as 3,000-ton hydraulic presses, six-ton trucks, crane-hoists, traction road rollers, and high-pressure vacuum pumps.
    Compared with September, the output of granular iron in the metallurgical industry increased by 33%, steel by 14.8%, and steel products by 7.9%. These achievements were due to increased utilization rates of blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and rolling equipment.
    In October, the mines produced 23,000 tons more iron ore than in September, and the output of other ores also increased significantly. Coal production in October increased by 98,000 tons compared to September. Workers in factories and mines under the Heavy Industry Committee are now actively striving to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule and preparing for the seven-year plan that will begin next year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 13th: Many industrial and mining enterprises in North Vietnam have completed their production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets.
    According to incomplete statistics from the beginning of this month, nine factories and mines in the heavy industry sector and sixteen factories and enterprises in the light industry sector in North Vietnam have already completed and exceeded their production plans for October of this year ahead of schedule.
    In October, many industrial and mining enterprises conducted studies on the formulation of economic and technical indicators and advanced technical standards, and further launched labor emulation campaigns. As a result, the enthusiasm of workers increased, and the level of production technology continued to improve. Due to the achievement of advanced indicators, the Hanoi Tran Hung Dao Machine Factory's production volume in just ten days was equal to the production volume of the past month.
    Construction workers in North Vietnam, in the upsurge of labor emulation, have carried forward the spirit of hard work and skillful work, overcome various difficulties, and created remarkable achievements. The second quarter of this year was a season with particularly heavy rainfall, and the amount of construction was greater than in the first and second quarters. However, thanks to the tenacious struggle of all workers and cadres, the construction sector still exceeded the quarterly plan with a score of 101%.
    During the construction process, construction workers actively improved construction tools, adopted new working methods, and proposed a large number of rationalization proposals, which increased the labor efficiency of the construction sector by 20% compared with the same period last year.
    In Haiphong, an important industrial city in North Vietnam, industrial and mining enterprises have widely promoted the spirit of diligence and thrift, utilizing waste materials and scrap to develop production, and have achieved great results. According to statistics, in the process of developing production, twenty-three major factories and mines in the city have expanded equipment and developed production by utilizing waste materials, scrap, and waste machinery, completing this year's production plans and the three-year plan (1958-1960) 69 to 188 days ahead of schedule, and saving the state more than 1.33 million Vietnamese dong.
    The Haiphong Cement Plant, which produces 400,000 tons of cement annually, has almost all of its equipment from repaired old equipment. Originally, the cement plant had insufficient power supply. The workers managed to repair a turbine generator that had been abandoned for fifteen years, which not only met the power supply but also provided electricity to nearby residents.
    In the joint state-private Haiphong Machine Factory, which manufactures small and medium-sized iron barges and steamships, all the machines were pieced together and repaired by the workers. This year, the workers in the factory completed the three-year plan ahead of schedule while repairing the machines. Moreover, the number of machines repaired increased, the technical level of the workers greatly improved, and the factory area doubled.
    There is also a machine production cooperative in Haiphong that has developed by relying on waste materials and scrap. The cooperative's drilling machines, planers, and small blast furnaces were all equipped by workers using waste products. However, relying on this simple equipment, hardworking workers can produce more than 600 threshing machines, more than 30 electric looms, tens of thousands of iron water pipes, and a large number of machine parts every year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 13th: After overfulfilling the production plans for the first three quarters of this year, workers in Romanian industrial and mining enterprises are determined to fight hard in the fourth quarter, complete and overfulfill this year's production plans, and strive to achieve a brilliant victory in the first year of the six-year plan (1960-1965).
    The production situation on the Romanian industrial front has been good in the first three quarters of this year. For example, enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Forestry Economy overfulfilled the production plans for the first three quarters by 2.9% and 8.7% respectively. Enterprises under the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemical Industry completed the total output value plan for the first three quarters four days ahead of schedule. Enterprises under the Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry overproduced 3.62 million square meters of fabrics, 3.4 million pieces of knitwear, 400,000 pairs of leather shoes, and more than 40,000 tons of sugar in the first three quarters.
    The fourth quarter is a crucial quarter for completing the annual production plan. In order to successfully complete this year's production plan, more and more workers have joined the production competition movement. The number of workers participating in the production competition in Bucharest factories has increased to more than 260,000. Good news of completing production plans ahead of schedule has been continuously reported from various places. The Geological Drilling Company and the "Antrepriza Frigorifica" enterprise under the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemical Industry both completed this year's drilling tasks and production plans two and a half months ahead of schedule in October. The "Proletarul" refractory material factory in Turda, the "Moldova" knitting factory in Iasi, and the Billard bearing factory completed their October production plans 23, 18, and 10 days ahead of schedule, respectively. Steelworkers also overproduced a lot of steel in October.
    Romanian workers have also achieved remarkable results in conservation. For example, steelworkers across the country saved more than 60 million lei (Romanian currency) in the first eight months of this year. The "May 1" petroleum equipment manufacturing factory and the "Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej" factory in Prahova County saved 5,000 tons of metal in the first three quarters of this year.

    广大职工奋战第四季度猛夺全年胜利
    朝鲜越南大批企业超额完成十月份计划
    罗马尼亚职工力争今年生产获得更大成就
    新华社平壤14日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国重工业委员会所属的工厂和企业以101.2％的成绩，完成了10月份的生产计划。
    电力、黑色金属、机器制造、化学、制药、水泥和其他工业部门的工厂和企业都已完成了10月份的生产计划。重工业产品的产量10月份比9月份增加了7.8％，其中铁矿石、菱铁矿、钢、钢材、电机、车床等比9月份增长了10％到61％，主要采矿机器增长了两倍到五倍。
    各机器制造工厂10月份生产出数十种不同的试制品，如三千吨的水压机，六吨载重汽车，牵引起重机，牵引压路机，高压真空抽水机等。
    和9月份相比，冶金工业的粒铁产量增加33％，钢增加14.8％，钢材增加7.9％。这些成就的取得是由于提高了高炉、平炉和轧钢设备的利用率。
    10月份各矿山比9月份多生产了二万三千吨铁矿石，其他各种矿石的产量也有很大的增长。10月份的煤产量比9月份增加九万八千吨。重工业委员会所属各厂矿工人现在正在积极努力争取提前完成今年的计划、并为明年开始的七年计划做好准备。
    新华社河内13日电　越南北方许多工矿企业提前和超额完成生产计划。
    据本月初不完全统计，越南北方已有重工业部门的九个厂矿和轻工业部门的十六个工厂、企业提前超额完成了今年10月份的生产计划。
    在10月份中，许多工矿企业都进行了有关制订经济技术指标和先进技术标准的学习，并进一步开展了劳动竞赛，因而职工的劳动热情更加高涨，生产技术水平不断提高。河内陈兴道机器制造厂由于实现了先进指标，仅在十天中的生产量就等于过去一个月的生产量。
    越南北方建筑工人在高涨的劳动竞赛中，发扬苦干、巧干的精神，克服各种困难，创造了显著的成绩。今年第二季度是一个雨水特别多的季节，建筑量又比第一、第二季度大，但由于全体工人和干部的顽强奋战，建筑部门仍然以101％的成绩超额完成了季度计划。
    在施工过程中，建筑工人们积极改进建筑工具，采用新的工作方法，提出了大量的合理化建议，使建筑部门的劳动效率比去年同期提高了20％。
    在越南北方的重要工业城市——海防市，各工矿企业广泛发扬勤俭精神，利用废材、废料发展生产，获得巨大成绩。据统计，这个城市的二十三个主要厂矿企业在发展生产过程中，由于利用废材、废料和废机器，扩充设备，发展生产，提前六十九到一百八十八天完成了今年的生产计划和三年计划（1958—1960年），并为国家节省了一百三十三万多越元的资金。
    年产四十万吨水泥的海防水泥厂，几乎所有的设备都是经过修理的旧设备。原来这家水泥厂电源不足，职工们设法修好一架废弃十五年之久的涡轮发电机，不仅满足了电源供应，而且还向附近居民供电。
    在制造中小型铁驳船、汽船的公私合营海防机器厂，全部机器也都是工人拼凑修复起来的。今年，这个厂的工人在边修机器边生产的情况下，提前完成了三年计划，而且机器越修越多，工人的技术水平大大提高，工厂面积扩大了一倍。
    海防市还有一个依靠废材、废料发展起来的机器生产合作社。这个社的钻床、刨床、小高炉等全都是工人们利用废品装备起来的，但就是依靠这种简陋的设备，勤劳的工人每年可以生产六百多台脱谷机、三十多台电动纺织机、数以万计的铁水管和大量机器零件。
    新华社布加勒斯特13日电　罗马尼亚工矿企业职工在超额完成今年头三个季度的生产计划以后，又决心奋战第四季度，完成和超额完成今年的生产计划，争取使六年计划（1960—1965年）的第一年就获得辉煌胜利。
    罗马尼亚工业战线今年头三个季度的生产情况很好。例如重工业部和林业经济部所属企业分别超额2.9％和8.7％完成了头三个季度的生产计划，石油和化学工业部所属企业提前四天完成了头三个季度的总产值计划，消费品工业部所属企业在头三个季度中超计划生产了三百六十二万平方米布匹、三百四十万件针织品、四十万双皮鞋和四万多吨糖。
    第四季度是完成全年生产计划的关键性季度。为了胜利完成今年的生产计划，愈来愈多的职工投入了生产竞赛运动。布加勒斯特各工厂参加生产竞赛的职工已增加到二十六万多人。各地已不断传来提前完成生产计划的喜讯。石油和化学工业部的地质钻探公司和“昂特雷弗里格”企业在10月份都提前两个半月完成了今年的钻探任务和生产计划。杜尔达的“无产者”耐火材料厂、雅西的“莫耳多瓦”针织厂和比拉德轴承工厂分别以二十三天、十八天和十天提前完成了10月份的生产计划。钢铁工人在10月份也超计划生产了很多钢。
    罗马尼亚工人在节约方面也成绩显著。例如全国钢铁工人在今年的头八个月中就节约了六千多万列伊（罗币名）。普罗什蒂州的“五一”石油设备制造厂和“乔治乌—德治”工厂在今年的头三个季度中节约了五千吨金属。
