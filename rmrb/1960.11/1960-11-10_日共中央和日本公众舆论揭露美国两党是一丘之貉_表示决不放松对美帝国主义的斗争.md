Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch from Tokyo: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement tonight regarding Kennedy's election as US President, calling on the Japanese people to continue to resolutely oppose US imperialism and strive for Japan's independence and neutrality.

The statement said: The results of the US presidential election prove how deeply dissatisfied the American people are with the cold war and aggressive policies pursued by the Eisenhower-led Republican government. A growing number of Americans are raising increasingly loud calls for peace.

The statement said: However, Kennedy's victory does not mean that the nature of US imperialism has changed. In the United States, even if the Democratic Party replaces the Republican Party, the danger of war still exists. The Democratic and Republican parties are both mouthpieces of US imperialism. During the Republican government's tenure, the Democratic Party, in fact, closely cooperated with the Republican Party to promote President Eisenhower's "Cold War" policy.

The statement emphatically pointed out: "If the people of all countries in the world form a broad international united front against imperialism and wage a vigorous struggle, the possibility of preventing another world war can be increased. The struggle of the Japanese people for the abolition of US military bases and the withdrawal of US troops, and for the independence and neutralization of their motherland, is an important part of the worldwide struggle against imperialism."

The statement also pointed out: "If the Japanese people unite more closely than ever before and further advance their struggle on the basis of the achievements made during the anti-Security Treaty movement, they will surely achieve the goal of independence and neutrality."

Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch from Tokyo: Leaders of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), in commenting on Kennedy's election as US President, emphasized that even if the US Democratic Party comes to power, the Japanese people should not relax their vigilance against the actions of US imperialism and should continue to fight it.

Suzuki Seiichi, head of the International Bureau of Sohyo, told Japanese reporters tonight that it is quite clear that after Kennedy wins the presidential election, the United States will not change its basic policy toward Japan, nor will it change its policy toward China, because the new president can only be a representative of US imperialists.

Suzuki said: "In order to combat the aggressive and bellicose policies of the United States, the Japanese people must unite closely and wage a serious struggle against imperialism. Our current priority is to drive reactionary politicians who support the 'Security Treaty' off the political stage through the upcoming general election."

Shoji Ogata, Permanent Director of the Japan Peace Committee, also pointed out that Kennedy's election as US President will not bring about major changes in US foreign policy.

Ogata told Japanese newspaper reporters that the Democratic Party replacing the Republican Party only shows that US imperialists feel an urgent need to use a deceptive new appearance to disguise their aggressive "policy of strength." He emphatically pointed out that the Japan Peace Committee will further strengthen their movement in order to expose the true face of US imperialists to the public. (Attached picture)

    日共中央和日本公众舆论揭露美国两党是一丘之貉
    表示决不放松对美帝国主义的斗争
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央干部会今天晚间就肯尼迪当选美国总统一事发表声明，号召日本人民继续坚决反对美帝国主义，争取日本的独立和中立。
    声明说：美国总统选举结果证明，美国人民是多么深深不满以艾森豪威尔为首的共和党政府所执行的冷战和侵略政策。越来越多的美国人民发出日益响亮的要求和平的呼声。
    声明说：但是，肯尼迪的胜利并不意味着美帝国主义的本质有所改变。在美国，即使民主党代替了共和党，战争的危险仍然存在。民主党和共和党一样都是美帝国主义者的代言人。在共和党政府当政时，民主党事实上一直在同共和党紧密合作的情况下促进艾森豪威尔总统推行的“冷战”政策。
    声明着重指出：“如果世界各国人民组成反对帝国主义的广泛的国际统一战线，进行声势浩大的斗争，防止另一次世界大战的可能性是可能增加的。日本人民为撤销美国军事基地和撤走美军、为争取祖国的独立和中立化而进行的斗争是世界范围反对帝国主义斗争的重要部分。”
    声明还指出：“如果日本人民较以往更加紧密的团结起来，在反对安全条约运动期间取得的成就的基础上进一步推进他们的斗争，他们必将达到取得独立和中立的目标。”
    新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会领导人在评论肯尼迪当选美国总统时强调说，即使美国民主党上台，日本人民也不应当对美帝国主义的行动放松警惕，并且应该继续同它斗争。
    “总评”国际局负责人铃木诚市今晚对日本记者说，十分明显，肯尼迪在总统竞选中获胜后，美国将不会改变它的基本的对日政策，也不会改变它的对华政策，因为新总统只能是美帝国主义者的代表。
    铃木说：“为了打击美国的侵略和好战政策，日本人民必须紧密团结起来，对帝国主义作严重的斗争。我们现在的首要任务是通过即将举行的大选把支持‘安全条约’的反动政客赶出政治舞台。”
    日本和平委员会常任理事尾形昭二也指出，肯尼迪当选美国总统并不会使美国的外交政策发生重大变化。
    尾形对日本报纸记者说，民主党代替共和党，只不过说明美帝国主义者迫切感到有必要用骗人的新外貌来掩饰他的侵略成性的“实力政策”。他着重指出，日本和平委员会将进一步加强他们的运动，以便向公众揭露美帝国主义者的真面目。（附图片）
