Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 31st: "Red Right Daily" reported today that Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba and head of the Cuban economic delegation visiting Czechoslovakia, met with the newspaper's reporter before leaving Prague and answered questions raised by the reporter.

    When talking about the development prospects of Cuba's national economy after breaking the control of American monopoly capital, Guevara said that not long ago, Cuba was still a semi-colonial country with a deformed national economy. It practically only produced one product—sugar, and it only had one market—the United States. Leaving aside the imperialists' military aggression against our country, just considering the economic struggle, it must be said that Cuba must strive by all means to overcome the two reasons that make it subordinate to American monopoly capital: single-crop production and reliance on only one market.

    First, we must find new markets to free ourselves from American economic control. The imperialists were furious about this and embarked on the road of aggression. This led Cuba to establish relations with socialist countries, which have developed into sincere friendship. Now, Cuba no longer relies solely on one imperialist market. But now we must begin an even more difficult task: ending the single-crop economy without causing any harm to the people. We will concentrate our efforts on developing heavy industry, which will create a foundation for further industrial development. We will also focus on developing industries that process agricultural and livestock products. We will also develop our agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries, which have great potential, to the greatest extent possible. With the help of socialist countries, we will also develop the mining industry.

    In response to the question of how the Cuban people are dealing with the United States' continuous conspiracies against Cuba, Guevara told the reporter that you must know that these conspiracies are of a military and economic nature. American imperialism is plotting these conspiracies at the Guantanamo base and somewhere in Guatemala, as well as throughout Florida in the United States, and is constantly sending armed forces and pirate planes from these places to invade our democratic country. The imperialist economic offensive against us culminated in an embargo on Cuban goods, similar to the actions taken against your country in February 1948. The Cuban people are of course prepared to defend their revolution, and their answer to the imperialist offensive is firm unity. Led by their rebel army, the workers', peasants', and students' militias, relying on the unity of the entire people, can repel well-prepared acts of aggression. Unity and revolutionary enthusiasm strengthen our defense capabilities. In the economic field, the Cuban people are responding to the aggressors' conspiracies with tenacious work to overcome the difficulties caused by the imperialist embargo.

    Finally, Guevara answered a question about the possibility of expanding relations between Cuba and Czechoslovakia. He said that relations between Cuba and Czechoslovakia are developing increasingly, and trade between the two countries is also increasing. The Czechoslovak government has accepted Cuban students and will send experts to help Cuba. He said that we feel we have true friends here.

    格瓦拉答捷“红色权利报”记者问
    古巴依靠全民团结能够击退美国侵略
    古巴同社会主义国家的关系已发展成为真诚友谊
    新华社布拉格31日电　“红色权利报”今天报道，古巴国家银行行长、访问捷克斯洛伐克的古巴经济代表团团长格瓦拉在离开布拉格之前接见了该报记者，回答了记者提出的问题。
    格瓦拉在谈到古巴打破美国垄断资本控制后的国民经济的发展前景时说，不久以前，古巴还是一个半殖民地国家，它的国民经济是畸形的。它实际上只生产一种产品——糖，它只有一个市场——美国。姑且不谈帝国主义对我国的军事侵略方面，只要考虑一下经济斗争，就必须说，古巴必须以一切手段努力克服使它从属于美国垄断资本的两个原因：单一的作物生产和只依靠一个市场。
    第一，我们必须寻找新的市场，以便使我们摆脱美国的经济控制。帝国主义为此对我们狂怒起来，走上了侵略的道路。这使得古巴同社会主义国家建立了关系，这种关系已经发展成为真诚的友谊。现在，古巴已不再仅依靠一个帝国主义市场了。但是，现在我们必须开始从事一项更加困难的任务：结束单一作物经济，而不使人民遭受任何损害。我们将集中力量来发展重工业，重工业将为工业的进一步发展创造基础。我们还要着重发展加工农牧产品的工业。我们还要在最大的程度上发展我们具有极大潜力的农业以及畜牧业和渔业。在社会主义国家的援助下，我们还要发展采矿业。
    在回答古巴人民如何对付美国对古巴不断进行的阴谋活动的问题时，格瓦拉对记者说，你一定知道，这些阴谋活动具有军事和经济性质。美帝国主义正在关塔那摩的基地和危地马拉的某个地方以及整个美国佛罗里达州策划这些阴谋活动，现在正不断从这些地方派出武装部队和海盗飞机来侵犯我们的民主国家。帝国主义对我们的经济进攻以对古巴商品的禁运而达到了高潮，这类似1948年2月对你们国家所采取的行动。古巴人民当然准备保卫他们的革命，他们对于帝国主义进攻的答复就是坚定的团结。以他们的起义军为首，工人、农民和学生的民兵，依靠全体人民的团结，能够击退有准备的侵略行动。团结和革命热情加强了我们的防御力量。在经济方面，古巴人民用顽强的工作来回答侵略者的阴谋活动，以便克服由于帝国主义的禁运而造成的困难。
    最后，格瓦拉回答了关于扩大古巴同捷克斯洛伐克的关系的可能性问题。他说，古巴同捷克斯洛伐克的关系正在日益发展，两国间的贸易也在增加。捷克斯洛伐克政府接纳了古巴留学生，并将派遣专家帮助古巴。他说，我们感到这里有真正的朋友。
