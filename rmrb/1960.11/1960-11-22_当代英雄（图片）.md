    Contemporary Hero
    Wang Tuliang, a 23-year-old punch press die fitter at the Shanghai Machine Tool Electrical Factory, has, in less than ten months this year, converted parts that originally required processing on lathes, planers, milling machines, and drilling machines to be processed on punch presses. Considering only the 52 larger innovation projects put into production, it is estimated that by the end of this year, more than 17,000 work hours can be saved, which is equivalent to the workload of one worker for more than seven years. If calculated based on the annual savings value, more than 76,000 work hours can be saved, which is equivalent to the workload of one worker for 23 years.

    当代英雄
    上海机床电气厂二十三岁的冲床模具装拆工王土良，在今年不到十个月的时间，把原来需要用车床、刨床、铣床、钻床等加工的零件，改成用冲床加工。单从其中五十二项比较大的革新项目投入生产来算，到今年年底即可节约一万七千多工时，相当于一个工人做七年多的工作量。如果从全年的节约价值来算，就能节约七万六千多工时，相当于一个工人做二十三年的工作量。王土良正在制造冲压附着盖板的模具。　　新华社记者　杨溥涛摄
