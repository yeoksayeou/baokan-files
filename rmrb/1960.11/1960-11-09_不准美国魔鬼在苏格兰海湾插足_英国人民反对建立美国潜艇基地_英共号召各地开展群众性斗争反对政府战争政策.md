Xinhua News Agency, London, November 6th: The Supreme Council of the British Peace Committee today called on peace conferences throughout Britain to immediately launch a nationwide campaign to protest the establishment of an American nuclear submarine base equipped with "Polaris" missiles in Britain.

The wave of opposition to the establishment of submarine bases equipped with "Polaris" missiles continued to rise across Britain last weekend.

On Saturday, a group of students, youth, and trade union members held a demonstration in Leith, holding banners that read "Don't let American devils set foot in Scottish bays."

At the anniversary meeting of the British Veterans Movement for Peace held this afternoon at Trafalgar Square in London, a resolution was issued to the British Prime Minister protesting the United States' establishment of a "Polaris" nuclear submarine base in Britain.

In Scotland, the Scottish Labour Party Committee requested the Labour Party National Executive Committee to take action against the "Polaris" nuclear submarine base and all foreign bases in Britain.

The newly elected Labour leader, Gaitskell, faced strong opposition from ordinary grassroots members twice over the weekend due to his support for the "Polaris" nuclear submarine base plan. At a Labour Party meeting held in Liverpool today, Gaitskell was subjected to nearly an hour of protests raised by representatives. The same situation occurred in Manchester on Saturday.

Xinhua News Agency, London, November 5th: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party today issued a statement calling for mass struggles to be launched throughout Britain to oppose the establishment of American submarine bases in Britain.

The statement said that the United States' establishment of such bases in Britain "is an important part of the American aggressive plan to wage rocket warfare," and that it "will make the whole of Britain the primary target in a nuclear war," bringing new threats to the lives of the British people.

The statement demanded that this struggle be extended throughout Britain, demanding that "factories, organizations, streets, and villages raise protests, organize rallies, send delegations, and carry out activities to force every member of parliament to fight against Macmillan's betrayal!"
