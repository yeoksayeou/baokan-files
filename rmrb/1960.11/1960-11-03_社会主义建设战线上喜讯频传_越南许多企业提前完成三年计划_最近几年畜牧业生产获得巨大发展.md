Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 2nd: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, many transportation and enterprise departments in North Vietnam have completed their three-year plan (1958-1960) ahead of schedule.

The various departments of the Vietnam Railway General Administration completed the three-year plan from fifteen days to seven months and thirteen days ahead of schedule. The cargo transportation plan was completed six months and three days ahead of schedule. The construction plan was completed seven months and thirteen days ahead of schedule. The Dong Anh-Thai Nguyen railway (the first new railway built in North Vietnam) completed the plan four months ahead of schedule.

In the past three years, railway workers have repaired ten locomotives themselves, with a cost 4.9% lower than originally planned.

Earlier, the General Post and Telecommunications Bureau also announced that the departments under its leadership had completed the three-year plan.

Also announcing the early completion of the three-year plan were the Tran Hung Dao Machine Factory in Hanoi, the Haiphong No. 4 Shipyard, the Hai Lin Coal Mine, the Hanoi Tram Company, the printing factory in the Thai-Meo Autonomous Region, and other enterprises. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture announced that by the end of September, sixteen of the existing forty-nine farms had completed the three-year plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 2nd: In recent years, animal husbandry production in North Vietnam, which is rich in mountains and forests and has vast grasslands, has developed significantly. Currently, there are 2.4 million cattle in the North, an increase of 30% compared to 1955 and double the number in 1939 during the French colonial period. There are now a total of 3.6 million pigs raised in various parts of North Vietnam.

In order to provide more traction for agricultural production, more fertilizer for crops, and at the same time meet the growing needs of light industry for raw materials and the people for meat, the provinces are currently making full use of local favorable conditions and vigorously developing the breeding and raising of large livestock in accordance with the principle of comprehensive development. Thai Binh Province plans to raise 600,000 cattle in 1961, an increase of 2.9% over this year; and 300,000 pigs, an increase of 29% over this year. Vinh Phuc Province will increase the number of buffalo and yellow cattle raised next year by 1.2% and 1.6% respectively compared to this year, requiring an average of 1.5 to 2 pigs per household throughout the province. Ninh Binh Province plans to ensure that each agricultural cooperative with conditions for raising livestock raises 50 yellow cattle or 30 buffalo.

At present, the provinces have begun to take measures to vigorously seize livestock feed and make full preparations for further development of animal husbandry.
