    U.S. Economic Situation Continues to Deteriorate
    Officials Admit Unemployment Will Increase Further; Steel Production Continues to Decline with Little Hope of Recovery
    (Reported by this newspaper) Just as the United States' gold reserves are approaching a "danger point" and the U.S. balance of payments crisis is becoming increasingly serious, unemployment in the United States is tending to worsen further.
    According to a report in the U.S. "Wall Street Journal" on the 15th, "The Labor Department predicted last week that seasonal factors alone would cause the number of unemployed to reach 4.2 million by mid-December and 5.2 million by January 15." However, the newspaper believes that, based on "conclusions from a survey of nearly two hundred companies in major cities across the country, it appears that the increase in the number of unemployed in the coming weeks will probably exceed the seasonal increase."
    The newspaper admits that due to the market slump, "sales are declining, and inventories of manufactured goods are rising," and therefore some companies are "planning further reductions in production and employment."
    In another message on the same day, the "Wall Street Journal" said, "The American Iron and Steel Institute predicts that steel production this week will be at approximately the lowest rate of any week this year without holidays." When discussing the trend of steel production in the next two months, the newspaper said, "Steel industry leaders believe that there is little hope for a rebound in production trends within this month or within this year."

    美国经济情况继续恶化
    官方承认失业人数还要增加  钢产量续下降回升希望极小
    本报讯　正当美国的黄金储备接近“危险点”，美国的国际收支危机日益严重的时候，美国的失业情况有进一步恶化的趋向。
    据美国“华尔街日报”15日报道说：“劳工部上星期预测，光是季节性的因素会使失业人数在12月中旬将达到四百二十万人，在1月15日达到五百二十万人。”但是该报认为，根据“对全国大城市的将近二百家公司调查的结论，看来在今后几星期中失业人数的增加，大概会超过季节性的增加。”
    该报承认，由于市场萧条，“销售额正在下降，制成品存货正在上升”，因而一些公司正在“计划进一步减少生产和就业人员。”
    “华尔街日报”在同一天的另一条消息说，“美国钢铁研究所预测，本星期钢产量将大约为今年没有休假的任何一个星期中最低的比率。”在谈到今后两个月的钢铁生产趋势时，该报说：“钢业负责人认为生产趋势在本月内，或是在本年内回升的希望极小。”
