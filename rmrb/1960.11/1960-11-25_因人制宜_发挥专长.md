　　Tailor Measures to Individuals; Give Play to Special Skills
    Our commune recently made a comprehensive arrangement for winter production. The commune Party committee decided that the whole commune would invest 32 percent of its total labor force in winter sideline production. Sideline production projects are numerous and have characteristics such as being small and scattered. In this situation, rationally arranging the labor force participating in sideline production and achieving tailoring measures to individuals and giving play to special skills is a major event in developing sideline production. Based on this situation, our commune Party committee helped each production team rank production projects, rank labor strength, and rank technical levels, so that sideline production arrangements were thorough and reasonable. For example, male commune members with strong labor power were assigned to engage in short-distance transportation and mining stones in the mountains. Rope making, weaving straw bags, and knitting fishing nets are light work, but they require mastering certain production techniques, so they were done by elderly or weak female commune members who were familiar with this production. Embroidery is a traditional sideline production here, and engaging in this production requires care and quick eyes and hands. Therefore, it was assigned to young women. At the same time, the commune also adjusted the scope of sideline production operations for the commune, production teams, production brigades, and individual commune members, and stipulated a system of contracting production, contracting work, contracting costs, and rewarding over-fulfillment, so the whole commune's sideline production quickly developed. By the end of October, more than 1,500 people in the commune had been invested in sideline production, collecting more than one million catties of various tree strips, and harvesting 500,000 catties of mountain grass for weaving straw bags; sideline products worth more than 80,000 yuan have already been produced.

    因人制宜  发挥专长
    我们公社在最近全面安排了冬季生产，公社党委决定全社用总劳动力的百分之三十二投入冬季副业生产。副业生产项目繁多，又具有细小、分散等特点。在这种情况下，合理地安排参加副业生产的劳动力，做到因人制宜、发挥专长是发展副业生产的一件大事。我们公社党委根据这种情况，帮助各生产队做了生产项目的排队、劳力强弱的排队和技术水平高低的排队，使副业生产安排得周到合理。如搞短途运输、上山采矿石，就派男社员中的强劳力去做；搓绳、编草包、织鱼网是轻活，但是要掌握一定的生产技术，就由熟悉这项生产的年老或者体弱的女社员来做；绣花是这里的一项传统副业生产，搞这项生产需要细心和眼明手快。于是就分配给青年妇女来干。公社同时又调整了公社、生产队、生产小队和社员个人副业生产的经营范围，规定了包产、包工、包成本和超额奖励的制度，全社副业生产就很快开展起来了。到十月底，全社有一千五百多人投入了副业生产，采集了各种树条一百多万斤，收割编草包的山草五十万斤；已生产出价值八万多元的副业产品。
