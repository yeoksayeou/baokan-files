    The Interrelation of Organic and Inorganic Fertilizers
    Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    "Fertilizer" is one of the important contents of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and fertilization is the key to the sustained leap forward in agriculture. Many facts since the Great Leap Forward have proven that applying more fertilizer and applying it skillfully play an important role in increasing yield per unit area. Therefore, how to expand fertilizer sources and improve the scientific and technological level of fertilizer application has become an urgent problem to be solved in agricultural production and scientific research.
    There are many kinds of fertilizers used in our country, which can be roughly divided into two categories: organic fertilizers and inorganic fertilizers. Organic fertilizers mainly include human and animal manure, composted fertilizer, green manure, peat, etc., which are the main sources of fertilizer in rural areas. Inorganic fertilizers include chemical fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonia water, superphosphate, calcium-magnesium phosphate, and phosphate fertilizer, and mineral fertilizers such as phosphate rock powder and lime, all of which are made through mining, processing, and manufacturing. Organic fertilizers and inorganic fertilizers are closely related in terms of composition, properties, and application.
    Organic fertilizers have many advantages. They have a wide range of sources, large quantities, diversified fertilizer content, and long-lasting effects. They can supply various nutrients needed for crop growth and development. Organic fertilizers contain a large amount of organic matter, which has a great effect on improving the physical and chemical properties of the soil and cultivating soil fertility. In particular, the combined application of organic fertilizer with deep plowing of the entire layer can accelerate soil ripening, turn the lower layer of soil into living soil, deepen the cultivated layer, and increase the soil's granular structure, which has a great effect on water retention, fertilizer retention, and air permeability. The Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute conducted experiments on the impact of organic fertilizer application on the physical and chemical properties of soil. The results were: soil aggregates (0.25-1.0 mm) were 3.64% in the control area and 15.5% in the area where organic fertilizer was applied for many years; organic matter was 1.2% in the control area and 2.83% in the area where organic fertilizer was applied for many years; total nitrogen was 0.06% in the control area and 0.15% in the area where organic fertilizer was applied for many years. Organic fertilizers also contain a large number of beneficial microorganisms and growth stimulants, which are of great help in promoting crop growth. During the decomposition process, organic fertilizers produce a large amount of carbon dioxide, which helps to release some mineral nutrients in the soil that are difficult for crops to utilize, transforming them into utilizable forms and strengthening crop photosynthesis. Production practice and science have proven that increasing the application of organic fertilizers is the main key to obtaining large-area stable yield increases.
    Inorganic fertilizers (chemical fertilizers) are mainly divided into nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus fertilizers. Most of them are soluble in water or weak acids, and are easily absorbed and utilized by plants. They have a fast fertilizer effect and a large yield increase effect. They are also easy to package, transport, and apply, which greatly saves labor compared to organic fertilizers. The country is vigorously developing the chemical fertilizer industry in various ways, which is of great significance for ensuring the high-speed increase in agricultural production in our country. Therefore, it must be used in combination with organic fertilizers to fully exert its fertilizer effect.
    The necessity and relationship of combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers are as follows:
    First of all, the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers can complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, alleviate urgency, and meet the needs of crops for nutrients in various growth stages, preventing excessive fertilizer at one time and fertilizer deficiency at another. Most organic fertilizers decompose relatively slowly and have a long-lasting fertilizer effect, making them suitable for use as base fertilizer to supply the nutrients needed by crops throughout the entire growth period. Most chemical fertilizers have a fast fertilizer effect, but it is not lasting, making them suitable for use as top dressing, to strengthen the supply of fertilizer needed during the fastest growth and the period of greatest fertilizer demand on the basis of applying organic fertilizer. The appropriate combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers can significantly increase yield. For example, the average results of national cotton fertilizer experiments in 1958 showed that applying nitrogen fertilizer alone increased seed cotton production by 7.5 jin per jin of nitrogen, while applying it in combination with organic fertilizer increased seed cotton production by 9.5 jin per jin of nitrogen. Another example is a fertilizer experiment conducted at the Lutai Farm in Hebei. Applying 15 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu without applying organic fertilizer increased wheat yield by 21.9 jin, while applying the same amount of ammonium sulfate on the basis of applying 1,500 jin of stable manure increased wheat yield by 35.9 jin, an increase in fertilizer efficiency of 63.9% compared to not applying stable manure. The combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers can not only improve soil properties but also supply crop nutrition in a timely manner, thereby greatly improving fertilizer efficiency.
    Secondly, the combined application of inorganic and organic fertilizers can promote the conversion of mineral fertilizers and also facilitate the decomposition of organic fertilizers. For example, when the masses in Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces of our country apply phosphate rock powder, they mix it with organic fertilizer and compost it before applying it in order to promote the decomposition of phosphate rock powder, which significantly improves fertilizer efficiency. According to the results of experiments in 14 rice areas in Yunnan, the mixed application of phosphate rock powder and organic fertilizer increased yield by 13.3% compared to single application. The results of experiments in Guizhou Province showed that applying 25,000 jin of organic fertilizer and 50 jin of phosphate rock powder per mu of paddy field after mixing and composting increased yield by 15.6% compared to single application, increased corn yield by 14%, and increased rapeseed yield by 32.6%. The reason for the yield increase is that after phosphate rock powder and organic fertilizer are composted, the acidic substances produced during the decomposition of organic fertilizer can promote the decomposition of insoluble mineral fertilizers, increase the amount of available nutrients, and accelerate the activity of soil microorganisms, thereby also accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and producing more available nutrients to meet the needs of crops.
    Thirdly, the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers can buffer the adverse effects of inorganic fertilizers on the soil and crops. In the case of large-scale and continuous application of inorganic fertilizers, it often causes a decrease in soil organic matter content, an increase in soil solution concentration, or an increase in acidity or alkalinity, which deteriorates the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil and affects the normal development of crops. The combined application of organic fertilizer can prevent these adverse effects and bring soil fertility to a higher level. In the past, in some areas of Guangdong, Shandong, and other provinces, ammonium sulfate had been applied for a long time and in large quantities. Because no attention was paid to the combined application of organic fertilizer, the soil became hardened, the acidity increased, and the yield could not be increased. After liberation, this bias was corrected, and farmers applied large amounts of organic fertilizer, which improved the previously deteriorated soil and gradually increased yields. This is a clear example.
    Fourthly, applying a small amount of inorganic fertilizer to green manure crops can significantly increase fresh grass yield. Using this method of using small fertilizer to nourish large fertilizer not only expands the source of fertilizer but also cultivates soil fertility. At the same time, green manure crops are also a high-quality feed, which is of great significance for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. The root system of green manure is very strong, and many slow-release inorganic fertilizers such as phosphate rock powder and bone meal, when used for general crops, are far less effective than when applied to green manure crops first, and then applied to other crops through green manure. Doing so can greatly improve the effectiveness of slow-release mineral fertilizers.
    From the above, it can be seen that the relationship between organic and inorganic fertilizers is mutually reinforcing and complementary. Organic fertilizer is fundamental, and it has the effect of comprehensively improving soil fertility. Inorganic fertilizer is auxiliary, and it has the characteristics of flexible and coordinated application. At present, we must vigorously develop organic fertilizer with pig raising and manure accumulation as the main focus, and actively develop the chemical fertilizer industry. In the future, even after chemical fertilizers are supplied in large quantities, organic fertilizer will still be the most important fertilizer and cannot be replaced by chemical fertilizers. This fully demonstrates that the Party's policy of "organic fertilizer as the main focus and chemical fertilizer as the supplement" is completely correct.

    有机肥料和无机肥料的相互关系
    中国农业科学院土壤肥料研究所
    “肥”是农业“八字宪法”重要内容之一，施肥是农业持续跃进的关键。大跃进以来的许多事实证明，多施肥和巧施肥对提高单位面积产量有着重要作用，因此如何扩大肥源和用肥科学技术水平，就成为农业生产和科学研究中迫切需要解决的问题。
    我国施用肥料的种类很多，大致可以分为有机肥料和无机肥料两大类。有机肥料主要包括人畜粪尿、堆沤肥、绿肥、草炭等，是农村中主要的肥源。无机肥料包括硫酸铵、氨水、过磷酸钙、钙镁磷、磷肥等化学肥料，和磷矿粉、石灰等矿物质肥料，它们都是经过开采、加工制造而成的。有机肥料和无机肥料在成分、性质和施用上彼此存在着密切的关系。
    有机肥料的优越性是多方面的，肥源广、数量大、肥分含量多样化、肥效持久，可以供给作物生长发育所需要的各种养分。有机肥料里含有大量有机质，对改良土壤的物理化学性质，培养地力，有很大作用。特别是结合深耕全层施用有机肥料，可以加速土壤熟化，使下层土壤变为活土，加深耕作层和增加土壤团粒结构，对保水、保肥和透气性都有很大的作用。土壤肥料研究所关于施用有机肥料对土壤的物理化学性质的影响作了试验，其结果为：土壤团粒（0.25—1.0毫米）对照区是3.64％，多年施用有机肥料区是15.5％，有机质对照区是1.2％，多年施用有机肥料区是2.83％，全氮量对照区是0.06％，多年施用有机肥料区是0.15％。有机肥料里还含有大量有益微生物和生长刺激素，对促进作物生育有很大帮助。有机肥料在分解过程中，产生大量二氧化碳，有助于把土壤中一些难被作物利用的矿物养分释放出来，转化为可以被利用的形态，并加强作物的光合作用。生产实践和科学证明，增施有机肥料是获得大面积稳定增产的主要关键。
    无机肥料（化学肥料）主要分为氮素、钾素、磷素肥料，大多能溶于水或弱酸里，很容易被植物吸收利用，肥效快，增产效果也很大，且便于包装运输和施用，较有机肥料大大节省劳力，国家正以各种方式大力发展化肥工业，这对保证我国农业的高速度增产有重大意义。因此必须与有机肥料配合施用，才能充分发挥肥效。
    有机肥料和无机肥料配合施用的必要性及其关系，有下面几点。
    首先，有机肥料和无机肥料配合施用可以取长补短，缓急相济，满足作物在各个生育时期对养分的要求，防止一时肥分过多和一时脱肥的情况。大部分有机肥料分解比较慢，肥效持久，适宜用做基肥，以供给作物整个生育期所需要的营养。大部分化学肥料肥力快，但不能持久，适宜用做追肥，在施用有机肥料的基础上，加强供给作物生长最快需肥最多时期所需要的肥分。有机肥料和无机肥料适当配合施用，更能显著提高产量。如1958年全国棉花肥料试验平均结果，单施氮素化肥每斤氮素增产籽棉七点五斤，配合施用有机肥料后，每斤氮素增产籽棉九点五斤。又如在河北芦台农场进行的肥料试验，在不施有机肥料的基础上，每亩施用硫酸铵十五斤，增收小麦二十一点九斤，在施用一千五百斤厩肥的基础上，施用同数量硫酸铵则增收小麦三十五点九斤，比不施厩肥的提高肥效63.9％。有机肥料和无机肥料配合施用，既能改善土壤性质，又能适时供应作物营养，从而大大提高肥效。
    其次，无机肥料和有机肥料配合施用，可以促进矿物质肥料的转化，同时也有利于有机肥料的分解。如我国云南、贵州等省群众施用磷矿粉时，为了促进磷矿粉的分解，和有机肥料混合堆沤后才施用，这样就显著提高了肥效。据云南十四个水稻区试验结果，磷矿粉与有机肥料混合施用，比单用的增产13.3％。贵州省试验结果，水稻田每亩用二万五千斤有机肥料和五十斤磷矿粉混合堆沤后施用，比单用的增产15.6％，玉米增产14％，油菜增产32.6％。增产的原因是由于磷矿粉和有机肥料堆沤后，有机肥料在分解过程中所产生的酸类物质，可以促进难溶性矿质肥料的分解，有效态养分数量增加，加速了土壤微生物的活动，从而也加速了有机质的分解，产生更多的有效养分，以满足作物的需要。
    第三，有机肥料和无机肥料配合施用，可以缓冲无机肥料对土壤和作物所起的不良影响。无机肥料在大量和连续施用的情况下，往往引起土壤有机质含量的减退，土壤溶液浓度的增加，或酸度碱度的增高，使土壤理化生物性质变坏，影响作物的正常发育。配合施用有机肥料可以防止这些不良影响，并将土壤肥力提到更高的水平。过去在广东、山东等省的部分地区，施用硫酸铵的历史较久，用量也较大，由于没有注意配合施用有机肥料，以致土壤板结，酸性增大，产量不能提高。解放后，这种偏向得到纠正，农民大量施用有机肥料，使过去已经恶化的土壤得到改善，产量逐渐增加。这是一个明显的例子。
    第四，对绿肥作物施用少量无机肥料，能显著提高鲜草量。用这种以小肥养大肥的方法，既扩大了肥源，又培养了地力。同时绿肥作物又是一种高级饲料，对发展农业和畜牧业都有重大意义。绿肥的根系很强，很多迟效性的无机肥料如磷矿粉、骨粉等用于一般作物，它的肥效远不如先期施用于绿肥作物，通过绿肥再施用于其它作物。这样做可以大大提高迟效性矿质肥料的有效性。
    从上述可见，有机肥料和无机肥料间的关系是相互促进、相得益彰的。有机肥料是基本的，它具有全面提高土壤肥力的作用，无机肥料是辅助的，具有灵活配合施用的特点。目前要以养猪积肥为主大力发展有机肥料，并积极发展化学肥料工业。将来化学肥料大量供应以后，有机肥料仍然是最主要的肥料，并不能被化学肥料所代替。这充分说明党所提出的“有机肥料为主，化学肥料为辅”的方针是完全正确的。
