The Style of a Master
Yao Renwei

    According to reports: In the Hongliu Production Team of the Zhongfu People's Commune in Lintao County, Gansu Province, there is an old commune member named Mou Youlan, who is sixty-eight years old. Although he is not a team cadre, he wants to be involved in all the big and small affairs of the team; although he is not a feeder, he goes to the feeding farm several times a day; although he is not a herder, he is also very concerned about the team's sheep; although he is not a canteen manager or a cook, he has planted one or two mu of vegetable fields for the canteen every year since the canteen was established in 1958;… In a word, Mou Youlan manages wherever he goes.

    Logically speaking, Mou Youlan is approaching the age of "seventy is a rare age" as the ancients said, and he could very well enjoy his old age; but he is still vigorous and insists on doing more and managing more. This is truly the style of a master of the country.

    Being a master of the country is easy to say, but not so easy to do.

    First, he has the revolutionary enthusiasm to speak and manage. In the old society, people had the saying, "Eat your own food, don't interfere in other people's business." Is there any such thing as "other people's business" in today's new society? No. Every penny and every inch of land are related to the national plan of diligence and frugality in managing the household and running the commune. To manage and speak out is precisely the manifestation of the high revolutionary enthusiasm and patriotic zeal of the citizens of New China.

    Second, he has a sense of political responsibility to take the world as his own. Mou Youlan said: "I am not doing this to ask for credit or reward, I am doing it for everyone. Even if I die tomorrow morning, I will still speak and manage tonight!" May I ask, is there any moral quality more precious than caring for the collective cause more than caring for oneself? The working people have won the world, if they don't manage their own affairs, who will?

    Third, he has a positive spirit of not caring about personal gains and losses, and everything proceeds from the interests of the Party and the people.

    The style of the old man Mou Youlan is noble. From him, we can clearly see that the individualistic, narrow-minded and selfish old habits of "each sweeps the snow from his own door, and doesn't care about the frost on another's roof" before liberation have been swept away; from him, it also fully reflects that the Chinese working people no longer have that slave-like appearance of the past, they have become masters.

    主人翁的风格
    姚人为
    报载：甘肃省临洮县中孚人民公社红柳生产队，有个六十八岁的老社员牟友兰。虽然不是队干部，可是队里的大小事情，他都要过问；虽然不是饲养员，可是他每天都要到饲养场里转几次；虽然不是放牧员，但他对社里的羊群也挺关心；虽然不是食堂管理员，也不是炊事员，但从一九五八年食堂建立以后，他年年都给食堂种一二亩蔬菜地；……一句话，牟友兰走到哪里管到哪里。
    按理说，牟友兰快活到古人说的“人生七十古来稀”的高龄了，很可以享个晚景；可是他老当益壮，偏偏要多管事、多做事。这是真正做了国家主人翁的风格。
    做国家的主人翁，说起来倒容易，做起来可不简单。
    第一，他有要说要管的革命热情。在旧社会里，人们有“饭吃自己，闲事莫管”的话。今天，在新社会里还有闲事么？没有了。一分钱、一寸土都关系到勤俭持家、勤俭办社的国家大计。要管要说，正是新中国的公民具有高度革命热情和爱国热忱的表现。
    第二，他有以天下为己任的政治责任感。牟友兰说：“我又不是为了请功求赏，我是为大家。我哪怕明天早上死，今天晚上还是要说要管！”试问，还有什么比关心集体事业比关心个人为重的道德品质更可宝贵的呢？劳动人民坐了天下，自己的事业自己不管，谁去管呢？
    第三，他有不计较个人得失，一切从党和人民的利益出发的积极精神。
    牟友兰老大爷的风格是高贵的。从他的身上，我们可以清楚地看出，解放前那种“各人自扫门前雪，不管他家瓦上霜”的个人主义狭隘自私的旧习气，已经横扫一空了；从他的身上，也正充分反映了中国劳动人民没有过去那一副奴隶相了，他们做了主人了。
