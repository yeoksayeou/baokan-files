    Creating Better Conditions for the Widespread Application of Building-Block Machine Tools
    The Communist Party of China Harbin Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Machine Tools and Automation Major Branch General Committee
    In the past year, building-block machine tools have seen new developments in both practice and theory. Currently, the application of building-block machine tools has expanded from individual fields to all areas of mechanical processing; from single machine tools to assembling workshops in groups; from research and experimentation to application in actual production. More importantly, through research on building-block machine tools, people have initially grasped the laws of machine tools themselves, and the superiority of building-block machine tools has been theoretically demonstrated. In the past year or so, our school has cooperated with the Ji Lian Machinery Factory, in addition to completing the experiments and summaries of large-scale “three-izations” (multi-purpose, automated movement, and universal parts) and “four-degrees” (high rigidity, high precision, reasonable cutting speed, and reasonable tool angle) building-block machine tools, we have also designed and manufactured three types of building-block machine tools: one is a medium-sized building-block machine tool composed of nine building blocks, used for small and medium-sized local factories; one is a small building-block machine tool mainly used for rural machinery factories and repair stations, with a total weight of no more than two tons. There is also a "small-small" building-block machine tool, with a total weight of no more than half a ton, which can be moved anywhere and repaired on the spot, and its function is equivalent to a "mobile repair station." We have also jointly designed a complete set of drawings for a building-block machine tool workshop with the Harbin Industrial Bureau Technical Research Institute and Ji Lian Machinery Factory. This new workshop, equipped with thirty large, medium, and small building-block machine tools, officially started production on October 9th. In addition, an adjustable building-block machine tool automatic line is being manufactured, installed, and adjusted in our school's mechanical factory. The completion of this automatic line will prove that building-block machine tools are also fully applicable to batch and mass production. Building-block machine tools can develop the machinery industry more, faster, and better and more economically.

    Since liberation, China's machine tool industry has made tremendous progress, but the number and variety of machine tools are still far from meeting the needs of various sectors of the national economy, especially the large demand for machine tools from rural people's commune machinery factories. The emergence and development of building-block machine tools provide an important experience for solving this problem. The various parts of each machine tool are divided into three categories: working parts, transmission parts, and supporting parts. Among them, the working parts are used for direct processing, such as drill bits and tool holders. The transmission parts transmit motion to the working parts, and the supporting parts only function as supports. The reason why one machine tool differs from other machine tools mainly lies in the difference in the working parts. Therefore, it is entirely possible to universalize the transmission parts and supporting parts of various types of machine tools. The building-block machine tools initially created by the workers of Ji Lian Machinery Factory already contained this concept. At that time, the workpieces to be processed by the factory were often changing. After one type of workpiece was processed, the workers would disassemble the machine tool and reassemble it into a machine tool for processing new workpieces. In the reassembled machine tool, often only the working parts were different from the original, while the transmission parts and supporting parts remained unchanged. In the subsequent sets of building-block machine tools that we jointly designed and manufactured, this building-block concept of universal transmission parts and supporting parts was further developed. A set of several universal transmission parts and supporting parts, together with various special working parts, can be assembled into other machine tools. We are currently designing and trial-producing a "complete set" of medium-sized building-block machine tools. In this set of machine tools, the universal parts for lathes, boring machines, and milling machines can reach more than 80% of all parts of the machine tool, and the structure is simple. The number of basic parts is only one-third to one-fifth of that of foreign machine tools with the same performance. This set of machine tools can be manufactured by general prefecture-level or even county-level small and medium-sized machinery factories. It can be seen that the application of building-block machine tools is a way to develop China's machinery industry more, faster, better, and more economically. Of course, this view is not just an idea, and the newly built building-block machine tool workshop of Ji Lian Machinery Factory is a strong proof. The building blocks in this workshop can be combined into various machine tools such as horizontal lathes, vertical lathes, milling machines, planers, drilling machines, boring machines, and grinding machines. If ordinary machine tools were used to equip this workshop, so many varieties of machine tools would have to be ordered from machine tool factories all over the country to be fully equipped; but now these building-block machine tools are entirely produced by some small and medium-sized local state-owned factories in Harbin. The production of these machine tools adopts the method of "decentralized production and centralized assembly," that is, divided into building blocks, assigned to each factory for production according to production capacity, and then concentrated in the building-block workshop for assembly. Facing the countryside, facing agriculture, providing simple equipment to accelerate agricultural technical transformation

    In the process of agricultural mechanization, a large number of agricultural machinery factories or repair stations are needed. These factories and stations require a complete range of machine tool varieties that can be matched; and they must be simple to manufacture and easy to repair. If these factories and stations are equipped with ordinary machine tools, they must have various types of machine tools, and they are often limited by size, and cannot repair large jobs. Because the products are not fixed, generally speaking, the utilization rate of these machine tools is also very low. The small and "small-small" building-block machine tools for rural people's communes created by us and Ji Lian Machinery Factory have great advantages compared with ordinary machine tools. A set of building-block machine tools is equivalent to several types of machine tools, and it can be said that it itself is equivalent to a small mechanical repair station. But the total number of its parts is less than that of an ordinary machine tool, and the processing range can be flexibly changed according to the size of the workpiece. It can be seen that the solution of the matching problem is of great significance to the realization of rural mechanization and commune industrialization. Further efforts should be made in "using the rough to do the fine"

    While we are vigorously grasping the popularization of machine tools, we also need to improve the level of the machine tool manufacturing industry, especially to produce a large number of special and precision machine tools to meet the needs of various more precise mechanical processing. At present, the structure of general special and precision machine tools is very complex, and some people think that it is necessary to have complex technical conditions to manufacture these machine tools. Starting from the analysis of the laws of machine tools, we found that the main difference between special and precision machine tools and general machine tools lies only in the working parts. Therefore, we can first concentrate our efforts on solving the problem of producing precision and special working parts, plus ordinary transmission parts and supporting parts, we can give full play to the characteristics of building-block machine tools of "using the rough to do the fine" and assemble precision machine tools and special machine tools to meet the urgent needs of the country. This principle has been initially proven in the practice of using building-block machine tools. For example, the boring and milling machines in the large-scale "three-izations" and "four-degrees" building-block machine tools can achieve the accuracy of more precise boring machines in the holes they process (for example, when processing a batch of holes with a diameter of 180 mm and a length of 300 mm, the inspection results showed that the taper and ellipticity were within 5 microns). These machine tools seem relatively simple and rough, but they have achieved such high precision, which is due to the fact that the boring bar and spindle bearings of the machine tools are relatively precise, and they have a decisive influence on the processing accuracy. Therefore, we believe that we can fully adopt the principle of "rough when it should be rough, and precise when it should be precise" to greatly simplify the production process of special and precision machine tools. Even in ordinary machine tool factories, with certain cooperation, it is entirely possible to produce these machine tools to meet the needs of the country. Give full play to the characteristics of building-block machine tools of "using the small to do the big"

    In order to rapidly develop China's mining, metallurgy, electric power, chemical and other industries, a large number of large machine tools are needed to process the large and heavy equipment required by these parts. Two years of practice have repeatedly proved that using building-block machine tools to process large workpieces is superior to general large machine tools in terms of machine tool manufacturing speed, cost, and utilization rate. According to our recent experience, we believe that further giving play to the characteristics of building-block machine tools of "using the small to do the big" and making the workpiece stationary is likely to be the direction of large parts processing. In analyzing the contradictions of the machine tool itself, we see that the function of the machine tool is to use the tool to cut the blank to obtain the parts we need. Therefore, any machine tool must include two parts: the tool system and the workpiece system, which constitute the two aspects of the fundamental contradiction of the machine tool. The larger the workpiece, the larger the transmission parts and supporting parts that move the workpiece, and of course the larger the entire machine tool. At this time, the workpiece system becomes the main aspect of the contradiction. The workers who created the building-block machine tool of "using the small to do the big" correctly grasped the principle that the two sides of the contradiction can be transformed into opposite aspects under certain conditions, and came up with a way to make the workpiece stationary, which eliminated the part that moves the workpiece, greatly simplified the machine tool structure, and can use the ground to support the workpiece. In this way, the main aspect of the contradiction is transferred to the tool system, and the tool system can be free from the limitations of the size of the workpiece, and even the machine tool can be moved to the workpiece for processing. For example, the main part of the boring bar machine created by the workers of Ji Lian Machinery Factory is only a boring bar, which can be moved to the machine to bore and repair the cylinder. Another example is the planer for planing large gears with a diameter of more than four meters, which is only about the size of a general small shaper. We believe that this method of "ants gnawing bones" can not only solve the difficulty of not having large machine tools, but also conforms to the laws of the machine tool itself. Some building-block machine tools still move the workpiece, and also have the characteristics of "using the small to do the big." However, keeping the workpiece stationary will make this feature more fully developed, which should become the direction of large parts processing.

    In short, whether from the perspective of popularizing or improving machine tools, building-block machine tools are more in line with objective requirements and have greater advantages than general machine tools. Of course, building-block machine tools have only been around for two years, and there are still many problems that need to be studied in depth and systematically, and need to be further improved and perfected in many aspects. We firmly believe that as long as the staff and workers of the mechanical industry system and the engineering and technical personnel engaged in this work work together, it is entirely possible to establish a machine tool industry system that suits China's characteristics.

    为广泛应用积木式机床创造更好的条件
    中共哈尔滨工业大学机械系机床及自动化专业分总支委员会
    今年来，积木式机床在实践和理论方面又有了新的发展。目前，积木式机床的应用已由个别领域发展到机械加工的各个领域；由单套机床发展到成群地装配车间；由研究试验发展到运用于实际生产。更重要的是，通过对积木式机床的研究，人们初步摸索到机床本身的规律、使积木式机床的优越性在理论上得到了论证。在这一年多来，我们学校曾和机联机械厂合作、除了完成大型的“三化”（用途多能化，运动自动化，部件通用化）“四度”（高刚度、高精度、合理的切削速度，合理刀具角度）积木式机床的试验及总结外，又设计制造了三种积木式机床：一种是用于中小型地方工厂，由九块积木块组成的中型积木式机床；一种是主要用于农村机械厂和修配站的总重不超过两吨的小型积木式机床。还有一种“小小型”积木式机床，总重量不超过半吨，可以随处搬动，就地修理，它的作用相当于一个“活动的修配站”。我们还和哈尔滨工业局技术研究所、机联机械厂共同设计了积木式机床车间的全套图纸，这个装备有大、中、小型各种积木式机床三十台的新车间已于10月9日正式开工生产。此外，一条可调整的积木式机床自动线正在我校机械工厂制造及安装调整中。这条自动线的建成，将证明积木式机床也完全适用于成批的和大量的生产。积木式机床能多快好省地发展机械工业
    我国的机床工业在解放以来有了巨大的发展，但是机床的数量和品种还都远不能满足国民经济各部门的需要。特别是农村人民公社机械厂对机床的大量需要。积木式机床的产生和发展，为解决这一问题提供了一个重要的经验。每一台机床的各个部件，分为工作件、传动件和支承件三类。其中工作件是用来直接进行加工的，例如钻头、刀架等。传动件是将运动传给工作件，支承件则只是起支架作用。一种机床之所以区别于其他机床，主要表现在工作件的不同上。因此，完全有可能将各类机床的传动件和支承件加以通用。机联机械厂工人群众最初创造的积木式机床已经包含了这种概念。当时工厂要加工的工件常常是变换的，当一种工件加工完毕后，工人就将机床拆开，重新拼凑成加工新工件的机床。在重新拼凑的机床中，往往只有工作件与原来不同，而传动件和支承件仍然不变。在以后我们共同设计制造的各套积木式机床中，进一步发扬了这种传动件和支承件通用的积木式思想，用一套若干块通用的传动件和支承件，再配上各种特殊专用工作件，就可以拼组出其他的机床。我们目前正在设计和试制“配套成龙”的中型积木式机床。这套机床中，车、镗、铣床的通用零件，可达机床全部零件的80％以上，而且结构简单，其基本零件数目只有性能相同的洋机床的三分之一至五分之一。这套机床，一般的专区级甚至县级的中、小型机械厂都能制造。由此可见，应用积木式机床，这是一条多快好省地发展我国机械工业的道路。当然，这种看法并不仅仅是一个设想，机联机械厂新建成的积木式机床的车间，就是有力的证明。这个车间里的积木块可以并组成卧式车床、立式车床、铣床、刨床、钻床、镗床、磨床等各类机床。如果用一般机床来武装这个车间，这么多品种的机床要到全国各地的机床厂订购才能配全；但是现在这些积木式机床，完全是由哈尔滨市的一些中、小型的地方国营工厂生产出来的。生产这些机床采取了“分散生产、集中装配”的办法，也就是分成积木块，按生产能力分给各厂生产，然后集中到积木式车间进行装配。面向农村面向农业为加速农业技术改造提供简易设备
    在农业机械化的过程中，需要数量很大的农业机械厂或修理站，这些厂、站都要求机床品种全，能配套；而且要制造简单、修理方便。如果用一般机床装配这些厂、站，就要具有各种各类的机床，而且还常常受到尺寸的限制，不能修配大活。由于产品不固定，一般说来这些机床的利用率也是很低的。我们和机联机械厂创制农村人民公社用小型和“小小型”积木式机床，比起一般机床来有很大的优越性。一套积木式机床相当于好几台各种类型的机床，也可以说，它本身就相当于一个小型机械修配站。但是它的零件总数比一台普通机床还少，加工的范围还可根据工件大小灵活变化。由此可见，配套问题的解决对实现农村机械化和公社工业化有十分重要的意义。进一步在“以粗干精”方面下功夫
    我们大抓机床普及的同时，也需要提高机床制造工业的水平，特别是生产大批的特种和精密机床，来满足各种更精密的机械加工的需要。现在一般的特种和精密机床的结构都很复杂，有的人认为一定要有复杂的技术条件才有可能制造这些机床。我们从分析机床的规律出发，发现特种和精密机床和一般机床主要不同的地方，也仅仅在于工作件。因此，可以首先集中力量解决生产精密和特种工作件的问题，再加上普通的传动件和支承件，就可以充分发挥积木式机床“以粗干精”的特点，组成精密机床和特种机床来满足国家的急需。这个道理在运用积木式机床的实践中得到了初步的证明。如“三化”“四度”大型积木式机床中的镗、铣床，加工出的孔都达到了较精密镗床的精度
  （如加工一批直径一百八十毫米、长度三百毫米的孔，检查结果，锥度和椭圆度都在五微米以内）。这些机床看来比较简单粗糙，但却获得这样高精度，这是由于机床的镗杆和主轴轴承都比较精密，而它们却对加工精度有决定性影响。因此我们认为完全可采用“该粗则粗，该精则精”的原则，大大简化特种和精密机床的生产过程。即使在普通的机床厂，采取一定的协作也完全可能生产出这些机床来，以适应国家的需要。充分发挥积木式机床“以小干大”的特点
    为了迅速发展我国的矿山、冶金、电力、化学等工业，需要大量的大型机床来加工这些部件所需要的大型和重型设备。两年来的实践一再证明，用积木式机床来加工大型工件，无论在机床的制造速度，成本和利用率等方面，都比一般大型机床优越得多。根据近来实践中的体会，我们认为进一步发挥积木式机床“以小干大”的特点，使工件不动，很可能是大型零件加工的方向。我们在分析机床本身的矛盾中看到，机床的功用就在于用刀具切削毛坯，以得到我们所需要的零件。因此，任何机床都必须包括刀具系统和工件系统两个部分，构成了机床根本矛盾的两个方面。工件愈大，使工件运动的传动件和支承件也就愈大，当然整个机床也就越大。这时工件系统就成了矛盾的主要方面。创造“以小干大”的积木式机床的工人，正确地抓住了矛盾的双方可以依一定条件向相反方面转化的道理，想出办法，使工件不动，这样就省去了使工件运动的部分，大大地简化了机床结构，并可以用地面来支持工件。这样，矛盾的主要方面就转到了刀具系统，而刀具系统则可以不受工件大小的限制，甚至可以将机床搬到工件身上去加工。如机联机械厂工人创造的镗杆机的主要部分只有一根镗杆，可以搬到机器上面去镗修汽缸。又如刨直径四米多的大齿轮的刨床，大小只相当于一般小型的牛头刨。我们认为，这种“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，不但可以解决没有大型机床的困难，而且是符合机床本身的规律的。有些积木式机床工件仍然运动，也同样具有“以小干大”的特点。但是工件不动，就会使这一特点得到更大程度上的发挥，这应该成为大型零件加工的方向。
    总之，无论从机床的普及或是提高方面来看，积木式机床都比一般机床更加符合客观的要求，具有更大的优越性。当然，积木式机床还只有两年的历史，有许多问题还正待我们去深入、系统地研究，在许多方面都需要进一步提高和完善。我们深信，只要机械工业系统的职工们和从事这项工作的工程技术人员，共同努力，建立起适合我国特点的机床工业体系，是完全可能的。
