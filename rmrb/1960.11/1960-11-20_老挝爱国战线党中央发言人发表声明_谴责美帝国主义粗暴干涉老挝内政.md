Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 19th: The Lao Fighting Forces Radio broadcast today that a spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 18th, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's blatant pressure on the legitimate government of Phouma and its crude interference in the internal affairs of Laos.

The statement pointed out that after the Phouma government adopted a clear attitude towards the rebellion in Luang Prabang, especially after Prince Phouma announced that he would use force to recover Luang Prabang, Reuters reported that a spokesman for the U.S. State Department actually declared: "Such open use of force will promote a further deterioration of the situation and will delay the division of Laos." The statement said that the statement of the U.S. State Department spokesman is undoubtedly a blatant threat to the legitimate government of Laos, and at the same time shows its blatant interference in the internal affairs of Laos.

The statement said that in the face of the above-mentioned conspiracies and actions of U.S. imperialism, the spokesman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front is authorized to issue a statement:

“(1) Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to subvert the Phouma government by using the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, and resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's blatant pressure on the legitimate Kingdom government, preventing it from exercising its legitimate power to govern the country. These actions of U.S. imperialism constitute a crude interference in the internal affairs of Laos, and at the same time are a serious provocation to the people of Laos and the people of Southeast Asian countries.

“(2) The Lao Patriotic Front calls on the Phouma government to take resolute measures against the above-mentioned actions of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The Lao Patriotic Front has always supported the Kingdom government in taking a firm attitude and measures to crush the conspiracy of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, liberate Luang Prabang and other places from the control of the traitorous clique, thereby defending the King, defending the legitimate Kingdom government, defending the motherland and religion, and defending Laos' path of peace and neutrality."

    谴责美帝国主义粗暴干涉老挝内政
    新华社河内19日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人18日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义明目张胆地向富马合法政府施加压力，粗暴地干涉老挝内政的行为。
    声明指出，在富马政府对琅勃拉邦叛乱采取明确态度，特别是富马亲王宣布要用武力收复琅勃拉邦后，据路透社报道，美国国务院发言人竟宣称：“如此公开地使用武力，将会促进局势更加恶化，并会拖延老挝的分裂局面。”声明说，美国国务院发言人的这一发言，无疑是对老挝合法政府的明目张胆的威胁，同时表明了它对老挝内部事务的露骨干涉。
    声明说，面对美帝国主义的上述阴谋和行动，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人受权发表声明：
    “（一）坚决反对美帝国主义利用富米·诺萨万叛国集团进行颠复富马政府的阴谋，坚决反对美帝国主义明目张胆地向合法的王国政府施加压力，阻挠它行使管理国家的正当权力的行为。美帝国主义的这些行动是对老挝内部事务的粗暴干涉，同时是对老挝人民和东南亚各国人民的严重挑衅。
    “（二）老挝爱国战线党呼吁富马政府对美帝国主义及其走狗的上述行动采取坚决措施。老挝爱国战线党一贯支持王国政府采取坚决态度和措施，以粉碎富米·诺萨万叛国集团的阴谋，把琅勃拉邦和其他地方从叛国集团的控制下解放出来，从而保卫国王，保卫合法的王国政府，保卫祖国和宗教，保卫老挝的和平中立道路。”
