Hold High the Three Red Banners, Vigorously Develop Agriculture and Food Production
Xishuangbanna People Strive to Build a New Border Region

(Our dispatch) Guided by the Party's Three Red Banners and the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and food production, the 320,000 people of all ethnic groups in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the Yunnan border region are striving to break away from the backward production conditions left over by history and are launching a large-scale campaign into the wasteland that has been dormant for thousands of years, determined to build the motherland's border region into a green treasure land.

The rich and beautiful Xishuangbanna is a vast world for vigorously developing agriculture and food production. The land here is fertile, the climate is warm, and the water resources are abundant, making it extremely suitable for agricultural production. Rice can be harvested three times a year, tea can be picked in all four seasons, and it is suitable for growing cash crops such as coffee, camphor, purple stems, sugarcane, and peanuts, as well as tropical fruits such as coconuts, mangoes, pineapples, and bananas. Despite the excellent natural conditions here, agricultural production was very backward in the era of reactionary rule. The average yield of grain per mu was only over 200 jin, tropical and subtropical cash crops could not be developed, and large areas of paddy fields and tea gardens were overgrown with weeds.

After liberation, the implementation of national regional autonomy, the completion of peaceful consultation on land reform, and especially the promulgation of the Party's General Line, greatly encouraged the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna. People were determined to develop production and change the face of their hometown as soon as possible. In the past few years, the people of the autonomous prefecture have marched into the wasteland year after year, expanding the area of cultivated land. Last winter and this spring, more than 1,000 cadres from the state, county, district, township, commune, and agricultural cooperative levels led the people of all ethnic groups to the wilderness. They built sleeping sheds with banana leaves, branches, and thatch on the edge of the wasteland and lived there to reclaim land. People eliminated or drove away the wild cattle, muntjacs, red deer, pythons, leopards, and wild boars there and reclaimed more than 70,000 mu of wasteland. After studying the Party's policy of taking agriculture as the foundation in July this year, people's enthusiasm became even greater. They planted late rice one season earlier and organized 70% of the labor force to reclaim land for winter crops, striving to harvest one more season of grain. They reclaimed more than 100,000 mu, which is more than the wasteland reclaimed last winter and this spring. A total of more than 140,000 mu of winter crops were planted throughout the state. Now, the winter buckwheat, corn, and sweet potatoes in these fields are growing very well, and people are weeding and applying top dressing. This year, the area of cultivated land in the entire state has reached more than one million mu (including the area of late autumn crops), an increase of more than 30% compared with 1957; among them, paddy fields have increased by 20%, and dry land has increased by 40%.

While reclaiming wasteland, the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna carried out revolutions in the cultivation system and technology. In the past, the people of all ethnic groups here only planted one season of late rice and did not plant early or middle rice. In 1955, Dai farmers in Mancangzai Township, Jinghong County, successfully trial-planted early rice with the help of Han agricultural technicians. Later, the experience of planting early rice was promoted throughout the state. This year, the vast majority of dams in the state planted early rice. The unit area yield of early rice has also increased by 5% compared with last year. This year, Dai members of the Manzeng Agricultural Cooperative in Mancangzai Township, Jinghong County, created the experience of three rice harvests a year with the help of Han agricultural technicians. The first season of rice yielded 889 jin per mu, the second season yielded 550 jin per mu, and the third season of rice has matured, and people are busy harvesting it. In the past, the main reason why Dai farmers only planted one season of late rice a year was that most of the paddy fields relied on rainfall for planting, and only about 100,000 mu of paddy fields could be irrigated with water conservancy, accounting for one-third of all paddy fields. Since 1958, more than 6,000 small reservoirs and ditches have been built and repaired, expanding irrigation to more than 200,000 mu of farmland, which is more than twice the total water conservancy construction before liberation. In the past, the ethnic minorities in Xishuangbanna did not have the habit of deep plowing. The small curved plows they used could only plow three inches deep, and they never carried out winter plowing. After the paddy fields were harvested, they had to wait until June and July of the following year to plow and plant at the same time. In 1957, the Manhe Agricultural Cooperative in Menghai County learned from the advanced experience of the inland, replaced the small curved plow with the large iron plow of the inland, which can plow more than six inches deep, and promoted advanced cultivation techniques such as winter plowing and sun-drying the soil. In 1958, Menghai County promoted Manhe's experience, and 80% of the ethnic minorities in the county used large iron plows for winter plowing. This year, the vast majority of Dai areas in the state have promoted the experience of this county. In the past, the ethnic minorities in Xishuangbanna did not apply fertilizer to crops, and they did not even eat vegetables that had been fertilized with human and animal manure. During the Great Leap Forward, the masses' habits gradually changed. This year, high-quality fertilizer was applied to every mu of paddy field. Previously, the plant spacing for Dai rice planting was very wide, with only about 10,000 plants per mu. This year, the average density per mu has reached about 25,000 plants. In the past, after the seedlings were planted, they were not weeded or top-dressed. This year, all the rice in the state has been weeded twice, and some places have also used chemical fertilizers to promote seedling growth.

Due to the increase in cultivated land area and the great improvements in the cultivation system and technology, grain production has increased year after year. In the past, the Hani people living in the Gelanghe mountainous area of Menghai County could never produce enough grain for themselves. The Hani people said, "Our people are in the mountains, and our stomachs are in the dam area." Since the Great Leap Forward, large-scale mountain terracing has been carried out, the cultivated land area has been expanded by more than half, and grain has been harvested year after year. Since 1958, it has not been necessary for the dam area to supply grain, and there can be more than 200,000 jin of surplus grain every year. This year, the Gelanghe mountainous area is another year of bumper harvest. The Hani people said, "With Chairman Mao, the stomachs of our Hani people have moved back to the mountains."

Under the guidance of the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing agricultural production, the cash crops in Xishuangbanna have also been greatly developed. The barren tea gardens have been reclaimed, and more than 50,000 new tea trees have been planted. This year, the output of "Pu'er tea" has far exceeded the highest annual output in history.

    高举三面红旗　大办农业大办粮食
    西双版纳人民奋力建设新边疆
    本报讯　在党的三面红旗和大办农业、大办粮食的方针的指引下，云南边疆西双版纳傣族自治州三十二万各族人民正在奋力摆脱历史上遗留下来的落后生产状况，向沉睡千年的荒地大举进军，决心把祖国的边疆建设成绿色的宝州。
    丰饶而美丽的西双版纳是大办农业、大办粮食的广阔天地，这里土地肥沃、气候温暖、水源丰富，极适宜于农业生产。水稻一年可以三熟，茶叶能四季采摘，适宜于种植咖啡、樟脑、紫梗、甘蔗、花生等经济作物和椰子、芒果、菠萝、香蕉等热带水果。这里尽管自然条件很好，但是在反动统治的年代里，农业生产却十分落后，粮食平均亩产量仅达二百余斤，热带和亚热带的经济作物得不到发展，大片的水田和茶园都长满了杂树野草。
    解放以后，经过民族区域自治的实施，和平协商土地改革的完成，特别是党的总路线公布，大大地鼓舞了西双版纳的各族人民，人们决心发展生产，尽快地改变家乡面貌。几年来，自治州人民年年向荒地进军，扩大耕地面积。去冬今春，全州一千多名州、县、区、乡、公社、农业社的干部率领着各族人民来到了荒原。在荒地边上用香蕉叶、树枝、茅草搭起卧棚，住在那里开荒。人们消灭或者赶走了那里的野牛、麂子、马鹿、蟒蛇、豹子和野猪，开了七万多亩荒地。今年7月学习了党的以农业为基础的方针以后，人们的干劲更大了，提早一个节令栽下了晚稻，又组织了70％的劳动力为冬收作物开荒，力争多收一季粮食，共开荒十万多亩，比去冬今春开的荒地还多，全州一共种冬收作物十四万多亩。现在，这些地里的冬荞、玉米、红薯都长得很好，人们正在薅草、施追肥。今年，全州的耕地面积已达到了一百多万亩（包括晚秋作物的面积），比1957年扩大了30％以上；其中水田增加了20％，旱地增加了40％。
    西双版纳的各族人民一边开荒，一边在耕作制度和技术上进行了革命。过去，这里的各族人民只种一季晚稻，不种早稻和中稻。1955年，景洪县曼藏宰乡的傣族农民在汉族农业技术人员的帮助下试种早稻成功。以后，全州都推广了种早稻的经验，今年全州绝大多数大坝子都种了早稻。早稻的单位面积产量也比去年增加了5％。今年景洪县曼藏宰乡的曼增农业社的傣族社员，又在汉族农业技术人员的帮助下创造了水稻一年三熟的经验，第一季稻亩产八百八十九斤，第二季亩产五百五十斤，第三季水稻已经成熟，人们正在忙着收割。以往傣族农民所以一年只种一季晚稻，主要原因之一是大部分水田要靠天下雨栽秧，能用水利灌溉的水田只有十万亩左右，占全部水田的三分之一。1958年以来，兴修整修了六千多件小型水库和沟渠，扩大灌溉了二十多万亩农田，等于解放前全部水利建设两倍多。过去，西双版纳的少数民族没有深翻的习惯，他们使用的一种小弯犁只能犁三寸深，而且从不进行冬耕，水田收割以后，要等到次年6、7月才边犁边种。1957年勐海县的曼贺农业社学习了内地的先进经验，把小弯犁换成了内地的大铁犁，能深翻六寸以上，并推广了进行冬耕、晒垡子等先进耕作技术。1958年勐海县推广了曼贺的经验，全县80％的少数民族都用大铁犁进行冬耕。今年全州绝大多数的傣族地区都推广了这个县的经验。过去，西双版纳的少数民族种庄稼是不施肥的，甚至也不吃施过人畜肥的蔬菜。大跃进中逐步改变了群众的习惯。今年每亩水田都施用了优质肥料。以前，傣族栽秧株距很宽，一亩地只有万把丛。今年平均每亩密植到二万五千丛左右。过去，秧栽下以后，不薅草、不追肥。今年，全州的水稻都薅过两次，有的地方还用化肥催苗。
    由于耕地面积的增加，耕作制度与技术有很大改进，粮食产量年年都有增长。过去，居住在勐海县格朗和山区的哈尼族人民，粮食从来不能自给。哈尼人说：“我们人在山上，肚子在坝子里。”大跃进以来，大搞山区梯田化，耕地面积扩大了一半多，粮食年年丰收，从1958年起就不需要坝区供应粮食了，每年还可有二十多万斤余粮。今年，格朗和山区又是丰收的年景。哈尼人说：“有了毛主席，我们哈尼人的肚子搬回山上来了。”
    在以粮为纲、全面发展农业生产的方针指导下，西双版纳的经济作物也有了很大发展，荒芜的茶园都垦复了，又新栽了五万多株茶树，今年“普洱茶”的产量远远超过了历史上的最高年产量。	　　　（叶子健）
