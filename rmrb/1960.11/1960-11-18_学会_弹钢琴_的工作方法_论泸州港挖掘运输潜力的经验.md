Learn the Working Method of "Playing the Piano"
    ——On the Experience of Luzhou Port in Tapping Transportation Potential

Ports are hubs for water transportation; ships depart from one port to load cargo and arrive at another port to unload cargo. Ports are distribution centers for waterborne materials and junctions for truck-ship combined transport. Doing a good job in port work can significantly improve transportation efficiency. Luzhou Port in Sichuan Province is a case in point: the comprehensive efficiency of loading and unloading operations at this port from January to October this year increased by 1.98 times compared to the same period last year, and the time ships spend in port has been reduced from three days to no more than one day. Based solely on the wood boat capacity transferring through Luzhou Port from places like Fushun, Luxian, Naxi, and Neijiang, the transportation efficiency from January to October increased by 213% compared to the same period last year, equivalent to adding 15,000 tons of transportation capacity, which could transport more than one million tons of materials per year. The great potential of ports is evident from this.

Every port has potential, but it does not mean that the potential of every port has been tapped. Why is it that the same ships can complete operations in less than one day at Luzhou Port, while some ports require five or six days? Is it because there are fewer materials imported and exported through Luzhou Port? No, the cargo volume of this port is increasing month by month, with a multiple increase compared to the same period last year. Is it because Luzhou Port has more labor? No, this port originally planned to add more than 1,900 workers this year, but not only did it not add any, it actually saved 578 workers. Luzhou Port has been able to tap the potential of water transportation because they have firmly grasped the central task of the technological revolution and have also done a good job in coordinating various other tasks. Last year, the mechanization of loading, unloading, and handling was achieved, and this year, the transition to the "small foreign groups" mainly based on electric power is being made, increasing the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading machinery from 68.5% in the first quarter to 92%. Now, efforts are continuing to further develop, consolidate, and improve the already innovated machinery. While grasping the central task of the technological revolution, Luzhou Port has also carried out port construction in accordance with the principles of spending less money and not spending money, adapting to local conditions and using local materials; it has also improved organizational management based on the new situation after the technological revolution; it has also strengthened the cooperation between transportation, loading and unloading, and material units based on the characteristics of the large number of material units coming and going through the transfer port. Taking the technological revolution as the center and doing a good job in all aspects of work, the potential hidden in the port can be fully realized. This is the main experience of Luzhou Port.

From the experience of Luzhou Port, we can see that learning the working method of "playing the piano" is very important for improving work efficiency. Why has the potential of some ports not been tapped? Some are because the central task is not clear, and they have not first concentrated their efforts to do a good job in the central task; others are because they only pay attention to one aspect of the problem and ignore others. In short, from the perspective of leadership methods, they have not yet learned to "play the piano." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To play the piano, all ten fingers must move; it won't do if some move and some don't. But it won't make a tune if all ten fingers press down at the same time. To produce good music, the movements of the ten fingers must have rhythm and coordinate with each other. The Party committee must grasp the central task firmly and at the same time carry out other aspects of work around the central task."
 (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 4, p. 1443) The facts of Luzhou Port prove that working according to the method advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong is very effective; otherwise, the desired results will not be achieved.

Why does the working method have such a big impact on work? Because the correct working method is in line with the law of development of objective things, and thus can greatly promote the development of work. In doing anything, one cannot use strength equally, but must concentrate strength to grasp the central link. Once this link is grasped, that is, the main contradiction is resolved, other problems will be easier to handle. But this does not mean that other work is not important, or that no effort should be spent on it. No, strength should be appropriately allocated around the central task, and other aspects of work should be gradually carried out. The outline and the meshes, the central link and the entire chain, are also a unity of opposites. Without meshes, there is no outline; without the entire chain, there is no central link. To strengthen port work, we must concentrate our efforts and carry out the central task of the technological revolution to the end without turning back. Without conquering this barrier, it is impossible to improve port efficiency. But at the same time, we must systematically coordinate the central task to strengthen all aspects of port work. Because the speed of ship turnaround is of course primarily determined by the loading and unloading of materials, but the loading, unloading, handling, and transportation of the port are an interconnected organic whole. If the work of the wharf, yard, storage, and warehouse is not adapted to each other, or if the transportation management is not adapted to the new situation of loading and unloading operations, even if the mechanization and semi-mechanization of loading and unloading are achieved, the role of these machines cannot be fully utilized. At the same time, port operations are directly related to transportation and material units, especially ports with a large number of transfer tasks, which have transfer relations with waterways and land routes, upstream and downstream, and a wide range of contacts. To achieve the goal of fast loading and unloading, we must also strengthen the cooperation of all relevant units. All of these tasks are to strengthen the central task and make the central task play a greater role, and therefore cannot be ignored. Before the third quarter, Luzhou Port had often had 800 to 1,000 tons of wood boat capacity unable to leave the port in time due to insufficient cooperation between material, transportation, and loading and unloading units. Later, the cooperation between the relevant units was strengthened, and this situation was eliminated, and transportation efficiency was improved. It can be seen that learning the leadership art of "playing the piano" requires a certain process, but it is also completely learnable. The working method is the means taken to complete the work task. If we want to do a good job, we must pay attention to the working method. If we want to fully realize the potential of water transportation, we must take the technological revolution as the center and comprehensively do a good job in all aspects of the port.

At present, the berthing time of ships in ports directly under the Ministry of Communications is still very long, and the sailing rate of ships is still low. If the sailing rate of existing wooden sailing ships and tugboats nationwide is increased by another 5%, the increased transportation capacity will be more than the total actual transportation capacity of newly built tugboats and wooden sailing ships in 1959. In order to tap such a huge potential for water transportation, we hope that all ports can, like Luzhou Port, firmly grasp the central task of the technological revolution and never give up until the goal is achieved. At the same time, in coordination with this central task, we must do a solid job in other aspects of work one by one, and greatly improve the efficiency of water transportation.

    学会“弹钢琴”的工作方法
    ——论泸州港挖掘运输潜力的经验
    港口是水上运输的枢纽，船只从这一港口装货出发，又到另一港口卸货。港口是水运物资的集散点，又是车船联运的衔接处。港口工作做好了，便能大幅度地提高运输效率。四川省泸州港即是一个例证：这个港今年1至10月的装卸作业综合效率比去年同期提高了一点九八倍，船舶在港时间由三天缩短为不超过一天；仅据富顺、泸县、纳溪、内江等地在泸州港中转的木船运力计算，1至10月份运输效率就比去年同期提高了213％，相当于增加了一万五千吨运力，一年可多运物资一百万吨以上。港口的潜力之大，由此可见。
    每个港口都有潜力，并不等于每个港口的潜力都已挖掘出来了。为什么同样的船舶在泸州港作业时间已压缩到一天以下，而有些港却需要五、六天呢？是不是因为在泸州港进出口的物资少呢？不是，这个港货运量逐月上升，比去年同期有了成倍的增长。是不是因为泸州港的劳动力多？也不是，这个港原计划今年要增加一千九百多个劳动力，结果不仅没有增加，反而节约出五百七十八个劳动力。泸州港之所以能够挖掘出水上运输的潜力，是因为他们紧紧抓住了技术革命这一中心工作，并且配合做好了其他各项工作。去年实现了装卸搬运土机械化，今年又向以电动为主的“小洋群”过渡，使装卸搬运机械化半机械化程度由第一季度的68.5％提高到92％。现在正继续努力使已经革新的机具再发展、再巩固、再提高。泸州港在抓好技术革命这一中心工作的同时，还根据少花钱和不花钱的原则，因地制宜、就地取材地进行港口建设；还根据技术革命后的新形势改进了组织管理；还根据中转港往来物资单位多的特点，加强运输、装卸、物资等单位的协作。以技术革命为中心，做好各方面的工作，蕴藏在港口的潜力才能充分发挥出来，这便是泸州港的主要经验。
    从泸州港的经验中，我们可以看到学会“弹钢琴”的工作方法，对于提高工作效率是十分重要的。为什么有些港口的潜力没有挖掘出来呢？有的是因为中心工作不明确，没有首先集中力量把中心工作做好；有的是因为只注意了一方面的问题，而把别的丢掉了。总之，从领导方法来看，还没有学会“弹钢琴”。毛泽东同志说：“弹钢琴要十个指头都动作，不能有的动，有的不动。但是，十个指头同时都按下去，那也不成调子。要产生好的音乐，十个指头的动作要有节奏，要互相配合。党委要抓紧中心工作，又要围绕中心工作而同时开展其他方面的工作。”
  （《毛泽东选集》第四卷1443页）泸州港的事实证明，按照毛泽东同志提倡的这个方法进行工作，就卓有成效；反之，就得不到应有的效果。
    为什么工作方法对工作的影响这么大呢？因为正确的工作方法是符合客观事物发展的规律的，因而能大大促进工作的发展。办任何事情都不可平均使用力量，而必须集中力量抓住中心一环，这一环抓好了，也就是主要矛盾解决了，其他问题就好办了。但这不等于说其他工作就不重要了，就可以不要花什么力量了。不是的，应当围绕着中心工作适当配置力量，逐步开展其他方面的工作。纲和目，中心环节和整个链条，也是一个对立面的统一。没有目，也就无所谓纲，没有整个链条，也就无所谓中心环节。加强港口工作，一定要集中力量，百折不回地把技术革命这个中心工作进行到底，不攻克这一关，要想提高港口效率是不可能的。但同时又必须有计划地配合中心工作加强港口的各方面工作。因为船只周转的快慢，固然首先决定于物资的装卸，但港口的装、卸、搬、运又是一个互相联系的有机体，如果码头、场地、堆栈、仓库各个环节的工作不相适应，或者运输管理与装卸作业的新形势不相适应，就是实现了装卸机械化半机械化，仍然不能充分发挥这些机具的作用。同时，港口作业又直接联系运输和物资单位，特别是中转任务很大的港口，与水路和陆路、上游和下游都有中转关系，联系范围很广，要达到快装快卸的目的，还必须加强各有关单位的协作。这些工作都是为了加强中心工作，使中心工作发挥更大的效果，因而都是不可忽视的。泸州港在第三季度以前曾因为物资、运输、装卸等单位配合不够密切，经常有八百吨到一千吨木船运力不能及时出港，后来加强了各有关单位的协作，这种情况消灭了，运输效率也就提高了。可见学会“弹钢琴”的领导艺术，需要一定的过程，但也是完全可以学会的。工作方法是完成工作任务所采取的手段。我们要想把工作做好，就要认真讲究工作方法，要想充分发挥水上运输的潜力，就要以技术革命为中心全面做好港口的各项工作。
    目前交通部直属企业的船舶在港停泊时间还是很长，船舶的航行率还低。如果把全国现有的木帆船和轮驳船的航行率再提高5％，它所增加的运力就比1959年全年新建轮驳船和木帆船的实际使用运输能力总数还多。为了挖掘出如此巨大的水上运输潜力，我们希望各个港口，都能像泸州港那样，狠狠抓好技术革命这项中心工作，不达目的，决不罢休。同时又配合这个中心工作，把其他方面的工作一个一个地切实做好，把水上运输的效率大大提高一步。
