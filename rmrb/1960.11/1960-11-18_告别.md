Farewell

Wang Jiexiong, Worker at Beijing People's Printing Factory

	I carried my luggage, saying goodbye to the Party Committee Secretary. All the words I had prepared were chased away by my racing heart. Two hands clasped tightly together. Ah, how familiar this broad hand is! How many times it has patted my shoulder, how many times it has gripped mine. Each time, each instance, it was like an older brother to a younger brother, entrusting hope after hope, congratulating victory after victory.

	On the Taihang Mountains, it was this hand that taught me how to aim and shoot; under the oil lamp in the mountain cave, it was this hand that taught me to write "Chairman Mao." On snowy nights, standing guard at the village entrance, it was this hand that draped a cotton coat over me; at the celebration meeting on the front lines, it was this hand that pinned a red flower on my chest.

	After the revolutionary victory and the establishment of the new China, it was this hand that taught me how to operate machines; whenever production surged ahead, it was this hand that hung up the red flag...

	Ah, how familiar this broad hand is! It gave me boundless strength, it gave me boundless fervor. Today, this even more powerful hand, patted my shoulders again:

	"Old comrade-in-arms, good comrade, go to the front lines once more!"

	Like a bugle call ringing in my ears, like a raging fire burning in my heart, I am just like I was back then—saying "Yes!" and snapping to attention.

	"Goodbye, dear Party Committee Secretary, my old company commander, my old superior. If I don't achieve merit on the agricultural front, I will never return to see you!"

    告别
    北京人民印刷厂工人  王杰雄我背着行李，告别党委书记，准备的话全被心儿跳跑了，两双手紧紧握在一起。啊，这双宽大的手，我是多么熟悉，在我肩膀上拍过多少回，和我紧握过多少次。每一次啊，每一回，就像哥哥对弟弟，寄上一个个希望，祝贺一个个胜利。在太行山上，是这双手教我瞄准射击；在山洞的油灯下，是这双手教会我写“毛主席”。雪夜站岗在村头，是这双手给我披上棉衣；在火线庆功会上，是这双手把红花给我带在怀
  里。革命胜利建立新中国，是这双手教我开机器；每当生产冒出尖儿，又是这双手给我挂红旗……啊，这双宽大的手，我是多么熟悉，它给了我无限的力量，它给了我无限的热力。今天，这双更有力的手，又拍抚在我的双肩：
  “老战友啊，好同志，再一次去上前线！”像冲锋号响在耳边，像烈火在心中燃起，我像当年一个样——说声“是！”打个敬礼。
  “再见，亲爱的党委书记，我的老营长，我的老上级。农业战线不立功，我决不回来见你！”
