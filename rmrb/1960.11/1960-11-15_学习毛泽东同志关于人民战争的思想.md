Studying Comrade Mao Zedong's Thought on People's War

(Continued from yesterday)

Combining Regular Warfare with Guerrilla Warfare

	The form of combat is determined by the comparison of strength between the enemy and ourselves. In order to deal with a powerful enemy and fully exert the power of people's war, it is not only necessary to conduct regular warfare, but also non-regular warfare. That is to say, it is necessary to simultaneously carry out regular mobile warfare, positional warfare, and non-regular guerrilla warfare, coordinating with each other, in order to fully exert the strength and role of various people's armed organizations such as the main force corps, local corps, and militia. Therefore, the people's war conducted under the guidance of Mao Zedong's military thought, in terms of combat form, is also a magnificent and colorful picture interwoven with regular and non-regular warfare such as mobile warfare, positional warfare, and guerrilla warfare.

	In the long revolutionary war, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the needs of people's war, Comrade Mao Zedong conducted new research and new creations on these combat forms of mobile warfare, positional warfare, and guerrilla warfare, creating a brand-new series of strategies and tactics for people's war.

	The Third Domestic Revolutionary War, which was a decisive battle between the armed revolution and armed counter-revolution in China, mainly took the form of regular warfare. In the early stage of the war, mobile warfare was the main form; in the later stage of the war, positional offensive battles to seize cities gradually rose to an important position and became the main form of combat. In this war, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the cooperation of the militia and the support of the people throughout the country, conducted large-scale corps operations, annihilating large numbers of enemy divisions, armies, and even entire army groups. The People's Liberation Army conducted a series of large-scale campaigns, including the Liaoshen Campaign, the Huaihai Campaign, and the Pingjin Campaign, which were unprecedented in the history of the Chinese revolution and rare in world history. The large-scale regular warfare of large corps marked the new development of the Chinese people's revolutionary war and marked that the long and arduous revolutionary war had developed to the stage of achieving final victory. In such a new historical period, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the famous Ten Military Principles, which are the most complete and scientific high-level summary of our army's combat methods, the pointer for combat in the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, and a major development of Marxist-Leninist military science. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly instructed us: In order to defeat the enemy and win the victory of the war, the main goal should be to annihilate the enemy's effective strength, not to preserve or capture cities and places; in order to annihilate the enemy's effective strength, we should first attack the dispersed and isolated enemy, and then attack the concentrated and powerful enemy. Concentrate two, three, four, and sometimes even five or six times the enemy's strength in each battle, surround the enemy on all sides, and strive to completely annihilate them without letting any escape. This is another new development of Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thought of annihilation warfare in the new period. The Chinese People's Liberation Army followed the combat policy prescribed by Comrade Mao Zedong. In the early stage of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, it voluntarily gave up some cities and places, avoided the attack of the enemy forces with superior strength and superior equipment, avoided decisive battles under unfavorable conditions, and carried out mobile warfare with large strides forward and large strides backward, annihilating the enemy one by one in the movement. In this way, on the one hand, the enemy's forces were dispersed, the enemy's offensive power was weakened, and the enemy was placed in a passive and beaten position; on the other hand, our army concentrated its forces in the campaign and battle, occupied absolute superiority in the local area, and got rid of the passive and beaten position, achieving the greatest initiative. In this way, the entire war situation was gradually reversed, so that the enemy changed from strategic offensive to strategic defense, and our army changed from strategic defense to strategic offensive. In this way, although our army temporarily abandoned some places in the early stage of the war in the case of disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, it exchanged for a large amount of annihilation of the enemy's effective strength, thereby more effectively achieving the purpose of recovering all the lost land and then liberating the whole of China. Later, with the fundamental change in the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves, Comrade Mao Zedong timely and skillfully seized the most favorable opportunity, selected the most favorable direction, carried out strategic decisive battles, organized the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin three major campaigns, and annihilated most of the enemy's main force. In this way, in just three years, Chiang Kai-shek's more than four million troops, which had been superior in numbers and equipment and seemed very powerful, quickly collapsed. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which had been inferior in number and equipment, rapidly developed and grew stronger until it achieved the final victory of the revolutionary war.

	Guerrilla warfare cannot bear the main responsibility for resolving the fate of the war. To resolve the fate of the war and achieve the final victory of the war, the main thing must rely on regular warfare. However, the regular warfare in the Chinese people's revolutionary war developed from the long-term non-regular guerrilla warfare. And it has always relied on the powerful cooperation and assistance of guerrilla warfare. From small to large, from weak to strong, this is the universal law of development of all revolutionary forces. When the revolutionary armed forces are still weak, in the face of the powerful counter-revolutionary armed forces, in order to preserve and develop the revolutionary forces and avoid unfavorable decisive battles, in a certain period of time and under certain conditions, dispersing forces to fight guerrilla warfare has a special and important significance and becomes the main form of combat.

	Therefore, in a long-term development process of the Chinese revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong raised guerrilla warfare to an extremely important strategic position. He called on us to develop guerrilla warfare as much as possible, widely and massively in the areas occupied by the enemy. Guerrilla warfare is not only the combat method used by guerrillas and militiamen, but also, under certain conditions where the enemy is strong and we are weak, we use regular troops to penetrate deep behind enemy lines, disperse and carry out guerrilla warfare, and strike and weaken the enemy and develop our own strength through guerrilla warfare. Comrade Mao Zedong used the sixteen-character formula to stipulate the basic principles of guerrilla warfare, which are "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue." Sometimes we disperse into parts, sometimes we concentrate from parts, appear and disappear unpredictably, feint to the east and attack in the west, sometimes in the south and sometimes in the north, fight and leave immediately. In this way, we constantly harass and fatigue the enemy, drag down the enemy's hind legs, contain the enemy's forces, cooperate with frontal operations, constantly weaken the enemy's strength, reduce the enemy's area, develop our own strength, and expand the revolutionary base areas. Under certain conditions, guerrilla warfare is transformed into regular warfare. Due to the long-term and complex nature of the Chinese revolutionary war and the different direct combat targets of the various revolutionary wars, Comrade Mao Zedong, according to the changes in the enemy's situation and the changes in the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves, timely guided the strategic transformation of the Chinese revolutionary war. In the early stage of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the Chinese People's Army had just been established, and our party had just begun to independently carry out armed struggle. At that time, the main thing was guerrilla warfare; in the later stage of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, it turned into mainly regular warfare. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, it changed from mainly regular warfare to mainly guerrilla warfare; in the later stage of the Anti-Japanese War, it changed from mainly guerrilla warfare to mainly regular warfare. By the time of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, due to the new growth of the revolutionary forces and the new changes in the enemy's situation, regular warfare gradually developed into large-scale corps operations using a large number of weapons and including large-scale positional offensives. However, even under the conditions of conducting large-scale regular warfare during the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong never relaxed in developing guerrilla warfare as much as possible. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, we not only persisted in guerrilla warfare in the areas temporarily occupied by the enemy, but also developed guerrilla warfare to the deep rear of the Kuomintang-controlled areas, powerfully cooperating with frontal operations and ensuring the victory of the war. For example, in the first year of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, guerrilla warfare in the Hubei, Henan, and Shaanxi areas contained more than thirty brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army, enabling our main forces in Central and North China to pass through the most difficult period of Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, playing a huge strategic role.

	Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical thought is invincible precisely because it is based on people's war. This strategic and tactical thinking of people's war can only be used by the revolutionary people to defeat the anti-people reactionaries. For the reactionary army, because they are divorced from the people and opposed by the people, they can never learn it.

Combining Armed Struggle with Other Forms of Struggle

	Armed struggle is the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution, but it is not the only form of struggle, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Emphasizing armed struggle does not mean that other forms of struggle can be abandoned; on the contrary, without the cooperation of various forms of struggle other than armed struggle, armed struggle cannot achieve victory."?

	The Chinese people's revolutionary war was developed and won based on armed revolutionary base areas. Comrade Mao Zedong was the founder of armed revolutionary base areas in China. He not only created the first revolutionary base area in the history of the Chinese revolution in Jinggangshan, but also consistently attached great importance to the construction of revolutionary base areas in the long-term development of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: The enemies of the Chinese revolution are extremely powerful, not only with powerful imperialism, but also with powerful feudal forces, and also with the big bourgeoisie who collude with imperialism and feudal forces and are hostile to the people. "The powerful imperialism and its reactionary allies in China always occupy the central cities of China for a long time. If the revolutionary teams are unwilling to compromise with imperialism and its running dogs, but want to persist in the struggle, if the revolutionary teams want to prepare to accumulate and exercise their strength, and avoid decisive battles with powerful enemies when their strength is not enough, then it is necessary to build the backward rural areas into advanced and consolidated base areas, build great revolutionary positions in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, in order to oppose the fierce enemies who use cities to attack rural areas, and gradually strive for the complete victory of the revolution in the long-term battle."? At the beginning of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, more than a dozen armed revolutionary base areas, distributed throughout the country and possessing a population of more than 100 million, were established and developed in the long-term revolutionary war under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, along the road of Jinggangshan. Without these revolutionary base areas, it would be inconceivable to smash the offensive of Chiang Kai-shek's more than four million troops supported by US imperialism, persist in the revolutionary war, and win the victory of the war. These revolutionary base areas were established relying on armed struggle; at the same time, the establishment and consolidation of revolutionary base areas is the support for persisting in armed struggle. Therefore, when the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas, in order to smash the enemy's offensive, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us to make the greatest efforts to consolidate and develop the revolutionary base areas, especially in the newly liberated areas. We must "popularize the idea of mobilizing the masses and establishing base areas to all cadres and soldiers, mobilize all forces, and quickly engage in the great struggle to establish base areas."? Because our revolutionary war is based on revolutionary base areas, we can effectively combine the struggle on the military front with the struggle on the political, economic, and cultural fronts. Powerfully support and cooperate with armed struggle; and armed struggle has also played a powerful supporting and guaranteeing role in the development of these struggles.

	In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong paid special attention to mobilizing the peasant masses to carry out land reform and develop production in the application of various forms of struggle in combination with armed struggle, and regarded it as two major events in defending the liberated areas. The work of mobilizing the peasant masses initially mainly carried out through rent reduction and interest reduction, and later developed into carrying out thorough reform of the land system. At the beginning of the war, Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized: "Only by doing a good job in the two major events of rent reduction and production can we overcome difficulties, assist the war, and achieve victory." "Do not neglect rent reduction and production because of the new large-scale war; on the contrary, it is precisely in order to defeat the Kuomintang's offensive that we must step up rent reduction and production."? Why does Comrade Mao Zedong attach so much importance to the issue of mobilizing the peasant masses and the issue of developing production, and regard it as a major issue that determines the victory or defeat of the war? This is because China is an agricultural country, and peasants account for 80% of the country's population. The people's war we are conducting based on revolutionary base areas is actually a peasant war under the leadership of the Communist Party. Establishing a consolidated worker-peasant alliance and organizing and uniting the broad masses of peasants around the Party and the proletariat has become the key to winning the victory of the revolutionary war. Therefore, it is necessary to enable the peasants to turn over from feudal oppression and become the conscious masters of the liberated areas, actively participate in the construction of the base areas, and participate in and support the revolutionary war. Therefore, in the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the Party resolutely led hundreds of millions of peasants in the liberated areas to carry out thorough land reform, adopted the class line of relying on poor peasants, uniting middle peasants, and neutralizing rich peasants, and eliminated the feudal exploitation system step by step and separately. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The thorough reform of the land system is a basic task of the Chinese revolution at the present stage. If we can universally and thoroughly solve the land problem, we will obtain the most basic conditions sufficient to defeat all enemies."? The same is true for developing production. Only by developing production, improving people's lives, and supplying the needs of the army can we support the long-term revolutionary war and achieve the victory of the war. Under the guidance of the principle of "self-reliance" stipulated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the liberated areas, under the slogan of "everything for the front line, everything for the victory of the war," launched a large-scale production movement, striving to achieve complete self-sufficiency in all necessities, especially grain and cloth, effectively supporting the war. According to the instructions of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army not only assumes the tasks of combat teams and work teams, but also a production team. Many troops use their spare time from combat to develop production on their own, solving most or all of their own supply problems, greatly reducing the burden on the people, overcoming financial difficulties, and playing an effective guaranteeing role in persisting in the war and winning the victory of the war. At the same time, the Party, government, army, and people universally carried forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, practiced strict economy, and vigorously opposed waste, making long-term plans everywhere, sharing weal and woe, and overcoming various difficulties with full confidence. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We rely on self-reliance in everything, stand in an invincible position, and are completely opposite to Chiang Kai-shek's everything relying on foreign countries. We are struggling hard, taking care of both the army and the people, and are completely opposite to the corruption of the upper echelons and the misery of the people in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas. Under such circumstances, we are bound to win."?

	In order to win the victory of the revolutionary war, our Party not only vigorously carried out the work of creating and consolidating revolutionary base areas, mobilizing and organizing the people of the liberated areas to carry out various forms of struggle against the enemy, but also conducted many negotiations with the enemy according to the needs of the struggle situation, thoroughly exposing the enemy's political deception; at the same time, it also used all available legal means and strengthened the work in the entire Kuomintang-controlled area. It should be particularly pointed out that the broad masses of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled area, under the leadership of the Party, launched a vigorous and great struggle against civil war, against hunger, and against persecution. The worker movement, the peasant movement, and the student movement developed vigorously, setting off a new upsurge of people's struggle. The broad masses of the people, regardless of the Kuomintang reactionaries' suppression of arrest, imprisonment, beatings, and massacres, held strikes, class boycotts, and market boycotts, and even fought bare-handed with Chiang Kai-shek's military police and secret agents. Under this situation, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "There are already two fronts in China. The war between Chiang Kai-shek's invading army and the People's Liberation Army is the first front. Now a second front has emerged." "The Chiang Kai-shek government, which is an enemy of the entire people, has now found itself surrounded by the entire people. Whether on the military front or on the political front, the Chiang Kai-shek government has been defeated, has been surrounded by the forces it has declared as enemies, and cannot think of a way to escape."?

	Our Party not only led the people's revolutionary struggle in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, further shaking the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and effectively cooperating with the victorious conduct of the revolutionary war, but also vigorously carried out the work of disintegrating the enemy army, dismantling Chiang Kai-shek's military machine from within. On the one hand, our Party cooperated with military struggle, launched a large-scale political offensive against the enemy army, used various methods to divide the enemy, disintegrate the fighting will of the Kuomintang reactionary army, and disintegrate the fighting will of the Kuomintang reactionary army by using the contradictions between Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops and non-direct line troops, and the contradictions between superiors and subordinates, and between officers and soldiers; on the other hand, made every effort to organize uprisings from within the enemy army, and strive to get a large number of Kuomintang troops to stand on the side of the people. In the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, especially in the later period of the war, these works achieved great success, accelerating the victory of the war and the collapse and demise of the Kuomintang army.

	The victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war is the victory of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war. The invincible great power of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war lies in its ability to mobilize the strength of the people to the greatest extent, fully rely on the people, and conduct a wide-ranging people's war. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war is a great contribution to Marxist-Leninist military science and a great development of Marxist-Leninist military science.

	The aggressive US imperialism, which is addicted to aggression, will never and cannot draw real lessons from the end of Hitler and from the history of its own failures. It is unwilling to fail in China and unwilling to fail again and again all over the world. It is still frantically preparing for war and pursuing a policy of aggression. It still occupies our territory of Taiwan. Regardless of the repeated warnings from our government, it constantly violates our territorial waters and airspace to carry out war provocations. The danger of imperialism launching a war of aggression still seriously threatens us. In order to defend our great socialist construction, defend Asian and world peace, and prevent imperialist aggression, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us that we must build the Chinese People's Liberation Army into an excellent modern revolutionary army, and at the same time, run militias on a large scale throughout the country. This is a new development of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war under modern conditions. Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war will always be our invincible magic weapon to defeat any powerful enemy. We should earnestly study and master this magic weapon to deal with imperialist aggression. The Chinese people have always loved peace, have always strived for peace, and advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, but we are also vigilant against the imperialists' conspiracy to launch a war of aggression. In the face of the US imperialism wielding nuclear weapons, fear and shrinking does not help peace, but only encourages the arrogance of imperialist aggression. Begging for peace can never make imperialism show kindness. The only way is to wage a resolute struggle against it, relentlessly expose and crack down on its war conspiracy, and put it in a completely isolated position in front of the people of the world; at the same time, always maintain a high degree of vigilance, ready to give a resolute counterattack when imperialism launches a war of aggression. Only in this way can we prevent imperialism from acting rashly, and it is possible to prevent war and maintain peace; only in this way, when the imperialist madmen dare to carry out war adventures, can we give the enemy a crushing blow, until we eliminate imperialism from the earth!

    学习毛泽东同志关于人民战争的思想
    陈伯钧
    （续昨）
    正规战争与游击战争相结合
      作战的形式，是根据敌我力量对比决定的。为了对付强大
  的敌人，充分发挥人民战争的威力，就不仅仅需要进行正规战
  争，而且还必须进行非正规的战争。也就是说，必须把正规的运动战、阵地战和非正规的游击战同时并举，互相配合，才能充分地发挥主力兵团、地方兵团、民兵等各种人民武装组织的力量和作用。因此，在毛泽东军事思想指导下所进行的人民战
  争，从作战形式上来说，又是一幅运动战、阵地战、游击战这些正规战与非正规战交织的壮丽多彩的图画。
    在长期的革命战争中，毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义的原则和人民战争的需要，对运动战、阵地战、游击战这些作战形式进行了新的研究和新的创造，创造了崭新的一系列的人民战争的战略战术。
    作为中国武装的革命与武装的反革命进行决战的第三次国内革命战争，主要的作战形式是正规战。在战争的前期以运动战为主；到战争的后期，夺取城市的阵地攻坚战逐步提到重要地位，而成为作战的主要形式。在这次战争中，中国人民解放军在民兵的配合下，在全国人民的支援下，进行大兵团作战，大量地歼灭整师、整军以至整个集团军的敌人。人民解放军进行了一系列的大规模的战役，其中包括辽沈战役、淮海战役、平津战役这样一些在中国革命历史上空前的在世界历史上罕见的巨大战役。大兵团的大规模的正规战，标志着中国人民革命战争的新发展，标志着长期的艰苦的革命战争已经发展到就要取得最后胜利的阶段。在这样一个新的历史时期，毛泽东同志提出了著名的十大军事原则，这是我军作战方法上的最完备最科学的高度概括，是第三次国内革命战争作战的指针，是对马克思列宁主义军事科学的重大发展。毛泽东同志明确地指示我们：为了打败敌人，取得战争的胜利，应当以歼灭敌人的有生力量为主要目标，而不以保守或夺取城市和地方为主要目标；为了歼灭敌人的有生力量，应当先打分散和孤立之敌，后打集中和强大之敌，每战集中两倍、三倍、四倍，有时甚至五倍、六倍于敌人的兵力，四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。这又是毛泽东同志天才的歼灭战思想在新的时期的新发展。中国人民解放军遵循着毛泽东同志所规定的作战方针，在第三次国内革命战争的初期，主动地让出了一部分城市和地方，避开了具有优势兵力和优势装备的敌军进攻的锋芒，避免了在不利条件下的决战，而进行了大踏步前进和大踏步后退的运动战，在运动中各个歼灭敌人。这样，一方面分散了敌人的兵力，削弱了敌人进攻的力量，陷敌人于被动挨打的地位；另一方面，使我军在战役战斗上集中使用自己的兵力，在局部上占据绝对的优势，而摆脱了被动挨打的地位，取得了最大的主动。这样就逐步地扭转了整个战局，使敌人由战略进攻转入战略防御，使我军由战略防御转入战略进攻。这样，虽然我军在战争初期在敌我力量悬殊的情况下，暂时放弃了一些地方，但是，却换得了大量地歼灭敌人有生力量，从而更有效地达到了收复全部失地进而解放全中国的目的。后来，随着敌我力量对比的根本变化，毛泽东同志及时地巧妙地抓住了最有利的时机，选择了最有利的方向，进行了战略决战，组织了辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役，歼灭了敌军的大部分主力。就是这样，在短短的三年中，曾经在数量和装备上占优势的看来十分强大的蒋介石四百余万大军，就迅速的土崩瓦解了。而曾经在数量上和装备上居于劣势的中国人民解放军，却迅速地发展壮大起来，直到取得革命战争的最后胜利。
    游击战争不能担负解决战争命运的主要责任。要解决战争的命运，取得战争的最后胜利，主要的必须依靠正规战。但是，中国人民革命战争中的正规战，是从长期的非正规的游击战发展起来的。并且又一直依靠了游击战的有力的配合和援助。由小到大，由弱到强，这是一切革命力量发展的普遍规律。当革命的武装力量还弱小的时候，在强大的反革命武装力量的面前，为了保存和发展革命力量，避免不利的决战，在一定的时期内，在一定的条件下，分散兵力打游击战就有了特殊的重要意义，并成为主要的作战形式。
    因此，在中国革命战争的一个长期发展过程中，毛泽东同志把游击战提高到极其重要的战略地位，他号召我们在敌人占领的地区，尽一切可能地、广泛地、大量地发展游击战争。游击战不仅是游击队、民兵所使用的作战方法，而且在敌强我弱的一定条件下，我们还以正规军深入敌后，分散开来开展游击战争，从游击战争中打击和削弱敌人，发展自己的力量。毛泽东同志用十六字诀规定了游击战的基本原则，就是“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”。时而化整为零，时而化零为整，神出鬼没，声东击西，忽南忽北，即打即离。用这样的办法，不断地袭扰和疲惫敌人，拖住敌人的后腿，牵制敌人的兵力，配合正面作战，不断地削弱敌人的力量，缩小敌人的地区，发展自己的力量，扩大革命根据地。在一定的条件下，把游击战转变为正规战。由于中国革命战争的长期性和复杂性，各次革命战争的直接作战对象的不同，毛泽东同志根据敌情的变化和敌我力量对比的变化，适时地指导了中国革命战争的战略转变。在第二次国内革命战争的前期，中国人民军队刚刚建立，我们党独立地进行武装斗争刚刚开始，那时，主要的是游击战争；在第二次国内革命战争的后期，则转变为主要的是正规战争。抗日战争爆发后，又由主要的是正规战争转变为主要的是游击战争；到抗日战争的后期，又由主要的是游击战争转变为主要的是正规战争。到第三次国内革命战争时期，由于革命力量的新的成长和敌情的新变化，正规战争逐渐发展到运用大量的武器并包括大规模的阵地攻坚的大兵团作战了。但是，就是在第三次国内革命战争时期进行大规模正规战的条件下，党和毛泽东同志仍然一刻也没有放松尽一切可能地大量地发展游击战争。在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，我们不仅在暂时被敌人占领的地区，坚持了游击战争，而且把游击战发展到国民党统治区的深远后方，有力地配合了正面作战，保证了战争的胜利。例如在第三次国内革命战争的第一年，鄂、豫、陕地区的游击战争曾牵制了蒋介石正规军三十个旅以上，使我华中、华北主力渡过蒋介石进攻的最困难时期，起了极大的战略作用。
    毛泽东同志的战略战术思想所以是战无不胜的，正是因为它是建立在人民战争的基础上的。这种人民战争的战略战术，只能由革命的人民利用来打败反人民的反动派，对于反动军队来说，由于他们脱离人民为人民所反对，因而是永远也学不到手的。
    武装斗争与其它各种形式的斗争相结合
    武装斗争是中国革命的主要的斗争形式，但不是唯一的斗争形式，正如毛泽东同志所说：“着重武装斗争，不是说可以放弃其他形式的斗争；相反，没有武装斗争以外的各种形式的斗争相配合，武装斗争就不能取得胜利。”?
      中国人民的革命战争是以武装的革命根据地为依托发展起来并取得胜利的。毛泽东同志是中国武装的革命根据地的创始者，他不仅在井冈山创造了中国革命历史上第一个革命根据地，而且在中国革命的长期发展过程中，一贯地极为重视革命根据地的建设。毛泽东同志早就指出：中国革命的敌人是异常强大的，不但有强大的帝国主义，而且有强大的封建势力，而且还有勾结帝国主义和封建势力与人民为敌的大资产阶级，“强大的帝国主义及其在中国的反动同盟军，总是长期地占据着中国的中心城市，如果革命的队伍不愿意和帝国主义及其走狗妥协，而要坚持地奋斗下去，如果革命的队伍要准备积蓄和锻炼自己的力量，并避免在力量不够的时候和强大的敌人作决定胜负的战斗，那就必须把落后的农村建成先进的巩固的根据地，建成军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大的革命阵地，借以反对利用城市进攻农村区域的凶恶敌人，借以在长期战斗中逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。”?在第三次国内革命战争开始时，分布在全国各地的拥有一亿以上人口的十几块武装的革命根据地，就是在毛泽东同志的指导下，沿着井冈山的道路，在长期的革命战争中建立和发展起来的。如果没有这些革命根据地，要想粉碎在美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石四百余万大军的进攻，坚持革命战争并取得战争的胜利，是不能设想的。这些革命根据地是依靠武装斗争建立起来的；同时，建立和巩固革命根据地，又是坚持武装斗争的依托。因此，当国民党反动派向解放区发动大举进攻的时候，为了粉碎敌人的进攻，毛泽东同志指示我们必须尽最大的努力巩固和发展革命根据地，特别是在新解放区，必须“将发动群众、建立根据地的思想普及到一切干部和战士中去，动员一切力量，迅速从事建立根据地的伟大斗争”。?由于我们的革命战争是以革命根据地为依托的，因而使我们能够有效地把军事战线的斗争同政治战线、经济战线、文化战线的斗争紧密地结合起来。有力地支援和配合武装斗争；而武装斗争也对这些斗争的开展，起了有力的支持和保证作用。
    在第三次国内革命战争中，毛泽东同志在运用各种形式的斗争与武装斗争相结合上，特别注意了发动农民群众进行土地改革和发展生产，把它看成是保卫解放区的两件大事。发动农民群众的工作，开始主要是通过减租减息进行的，后来则发展成为进行彻底的土地制度的改革。在战争开始时，毛泽东同志就强调指出：“只有减租和生产两件大事办好了，才能克服困难，援助战争，取得胜利。”“不要因为新的大规模战争而疏忽减租和生产；恰好相反，正是为了战胜国民党的进攻，而要加紧减租和生产。”?为什么毛泽东同志如此看重发动农民群众问题和发展生产问题，并把它看成是决定战争胜负的重大问题呢？这是由于中国是一个农业国，农民占了全国人口的80％，我们以革命根据地为依托所进行的人民战争，实际上又是在共产党领导下的农民战争，建立巩固的工农联盟，把广大农民群众组织和团结在党和无产阶级的周围，就成了争取革命战争胜利的关键。因此，必须使农民在封建压迫下翻过身来，成为解放区自觉的主人翁，积极参加根据地的建设，参加和支持革命战争。因此，在第三次国内革命战争中，党坚决地领导了解放区的亿万农民进行了彻底的土地改革，采取依靠贫农、团结中农、中立富农的阶级路线，有步骤地、有分别地消灭封建剥削制度。正如毛泽东同志所说：“土地制度的彻底改革，是现阶段中国革命的一项基本任务。如果我们能够普遍地彻底地解决土地问题，我们就获得了足以战胜一切敌人的最基本的条件。”?发展生产也是同样。只有发展生产，改善人民生活，供给军队的需要，才能支持长期的革命战争和取得战争的胜利。解放区的人民在党和毛泽东同志规定的“自力更生”的方针指导下，在“一切为了前线、一切为了战争的胜利”的口号下，开展了规模巨大的生产运动，努力做到了一切必需品首先是粮食和布匹的完全自给，有效地支援了战争。中国人民解放军根据党和毛泽东同志的指示，不仅担负着战斗队和工作队的任务，而且它又是一个生产队。许多部队利用战斗之暇，自己动手，发展生产，解决了自己大部或全部的给养供应问题，大大减轻了人民的负担，克服了财政困难，对坚持战争和取得战争的胜利起了有效的保证作用。同时，党政军民普遍发扬了艰苦奋斗的优良传统，厉行节约，力戒浪费，处处作持久打算，大家同甘苦，共患难，满怀信心地战胜种种困难。正如毛泽东同志所说：“我们是一切依靠自力更生，立于不败之地，和蒋介石的一切依靠外国，完全相反。我们是艰苦奋斗，军民兼顾，和蒋介石统治区的上面贪污腐化，下面民不聊生，完全相反。在这种情形下，我们是一定要胜利的。”?
    为了取得革命战争的胜利，我们党不仅大力进行了创造和巩固革命根据地的工作，发动和组织解放区的人民对敌人进行各种形式的斗争，而且根据斗争形势的需要，同敌人进行了多次的谈判，彻底揭露了敌人的政治欺骗；同时还利用了一切可以利用的合法手段，还加强了整个国民党统治区的工作。特别应当提出的是，国民党统治区的广大人民，在党的领导下，展开了轰轰烈烈的反内战、反饥饿、反迫害的伟大斗争，工人运动、农民运动、学生运动蓬勃发展，掀起了人民斗争的新高潮。广大的人民群众不顾国民党反动派的逮捕、监禁、殴打、屠杀等暴力手段的镇压，举行罢工、罢课、罢市，甚至赤手空拳地同蒋介石的军警特务搏斗。在这种形势下，毛泽东同志指出：“中国境内已有了两条战线。蒋介石进犯军和人民解放军的战争，这是第一条战线。现在又出现了第二条战线。”“和全民为敌的蒋介石政府，现在已经发现它自己处在全民的包围中。无论是在军事战线上，或者是在政治战线上，蒋介石政府都打了败仗，都已被它所宣布为敌人的力量所包围，并且想不出逃脱的方法。”?
    我们党不仅领导了国民党统治区的人民革命斗争，进一步动摇了国民党的反动统治，有效地配合了革命战争的胜利进行，而且还大力开展了瓦解敌军的工作，从内部来拆散蒋介石的军事机器。一方面我们党配合军事斗争，对敌军展开了大规模的政治攻势，利用敌人内部的蒋介石嫡系军队与非嫡系军队的矛盾和上下之间、官兵之间的矛盾，用各种方式分化敌人，瓦解国民党反动军队的战斗意志；另一方面，尽一切努力从敌军的内部去组织起义，争取大量的国民党军队站到人民方面来。在第三次国内革命战争中，尤其是在战争的后期，这些工作得到了极大的成效，加速了战争的胜利与国民党军队的崩溃和灭亡。
    中国人民革命战争的胜利，是毛泽东同志人民战争思想的胜利。毛泽东同志的人民战争思想的无往不胜的伟力，就在于它能够最大程度地调动起人民群众的力量，充分地依靠人民群众，进行广泛的人民战争。毛泽东同志的人民战争思想是对马克思列宁主义军事科学的伟大贡献，是对马克思列宁主义军事科学的伟大发展。
    侵略成性的美帝国主义，永远不肯也不可能从希特勒的下场和从他们自己失败的历史中去吸取真正的教训，它不甘心在中国的失败，不甘心在全世界各地一次又一次的失败，仍然疯狂地进行战争准备和推行侵略政策，它仍然霸占着我国的领土台湾，不顾我国政府的一再警告，不断侵犯我国的领海领空进行战争挑衅。帝国主义发动侵略战争的危险仍然严重地威胁着我们。为了保卫我国的伟大的社会主义建设，保卫亚洲和世界和平，防止帝国主义的侵略，毛泽东同志指示我们，必须把中国人民解放军建设成为一支优良的现代化革命军队，同时在全国范围内大办民兵，这是毛泽东同志人民战争思想在现代条件下的新发展。毛泽东同志的人民战争的思想，永远是我们打败任何强大敌人的战无不胜的法宝。我们应当认真地学习和掌握这一法宝，来对付帝国主义的侵略。中国人民一贯爱好和平，一贯努力争取和平，主张不同社会制度的国家实行和平共处，但是我们也警惕着帝国主义发动侵略战争的阴谋。在挥舞着核子武器的美帝国主义的面前，恐惧畏缩无助于和平而只能助长帝国主义的侵略气焰，乞求和平也永远不能使帝国主义发出善心。唯一的办法就是同它进行坚决的斗争，无情地揭露和打击它的战争阴谋，使它在全世界人民面前处于完全孤立的境地；同时，时刻保持高度警惕，准备在帝国主义发动侵略战争的时候给予坚决的回击。只有这样，才能使帝国主义不敢轻举妄动，才可能防止战争，维护和平；只有这样，当帝国主义疯子胆敢进行战争冒险的时候，才能给敌人以粉碎性的打击，直到把帝国主义从地球上消灭！
