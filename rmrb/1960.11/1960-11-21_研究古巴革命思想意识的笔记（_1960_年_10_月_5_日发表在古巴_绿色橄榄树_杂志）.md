Notes on Studying the Ideological Consciousness of the Cuban Revolution
(Published in the Cuban "Green Olive Tree" Magazine on October 5, 1960) by Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara

The Cuban Revolution is a unique revolution. Some people believe that this revolution is inconsistent with one of the most orthodox premises of the revolutionary movement expressed by Lenin: "Without revolutionary theory, there will be no revolutionary movement." It should be said that revolutionary theory, as a manifestation of social reality, is not only limited to the scope of written expression. That is to say, even if one does not understand theory, as long as one can correctly explain the historical reality and correctly use the forces participating in the revolution, one can still carry out the revolution. All revolutions are attended by people with various tendencies, but they are consistent in their actions and in the most immediate goals of the revolution.

Obviously, if the leaders have sufficient theoretical knowledge before taking action, they can avoid hesitation and mistakes, as long as the theory adopted is in line with reality.

The protagonists of the Cuban Revolution did not have complete theoretical standards, but it cannot be said that they knew nothing about the various views on history, society, economy, and revolution discussed in the world today.

Due to a deep understanding of reality, close ties with the people, a firm commitment to the goal of liberation, and experience in revolutionary practice, these leaders have been able to arrive at a more complete theoretical concept.

The above can be regarded as a small introduction, and the purpose of this article is to explain a strange phenomenon that makes everyone feel puzzled: the Cuban Revolution. How is it possible and why is it possible for a small group of people to survive after being severely hit by an army that is greatly superior in technology and equipment, then gradually strengthen, then become stronger than the enemy in the combat area, and then enter new combat areas, and finally defeat the enemy in the field, even though the army they possess is still at a great numerical disadvantage? This is indeed a fact worthy of study in the history of the modern world.

Naturally, since we have not always shown proper concern for theory, we are not explaining the truth of the Cuban Revolution today as experts in theory, we only want to provide some basis for explaining this truth. In fact, the Cuban Revolution should be divided into two completely different stages: the stage from armed action to January 1, 1959, and the stage of political, economic and social changes thereafter.

Although these two stages can also be subdivided into several small stages, we will understand these two stages not from the point of view of historical explanation, but from the point of view of the evolution of the revolutionary ideas of their leaders through contact with the people. Here, we must also talk about the general attitude towards one of the most debated terms in the world today – Marxism. If someone asks us whether we are Marxists, our attitude is the same as that of a physicist when people ask him whether he is a "Newtonian," or a biologist when people ask him whether he is a "Pasteurian."

Some truths are clear and known to everyone, and there is no need to discuss them. The question of whether one is a "Marxist" is the same in nature as whether one is a "Newtonian" in physics or a "Pasteurian" in biology. It must be considered that new facts certainly determine new concepts, but they will never make the past lose its truth. For example, the relationship between Einstein's theory of relativity and Planck's "quantum" theory and Newton's discoveries is like this; their discoveries do not detract from the greatness of this British scholar. It was because of Newton that physics was able to advance to obtain new concepts of space. This British scholar is a necessary link in the development of physics.

The development of socio-political science, like other fields, is a long historical process, and its various links are connected, constantly increasing, connecting, and perfecting. At the beginning of mankind, there was only Chinese, Arabic, or Indian mathematics; but today mathematics has no borders. In the history of mankind, there was a Greek Pythagoras, an Italian Galileo, an English Newton, a German Gauss, a Russian Lobachevsky, an Einstein, and so on. The same is true in social and political science. From Democritus to Marx, countless thinkers of various eras have gradually enriched these sciences and accumulated a large amount of experience and doctrine with their unique research.

Marx's achievement is that he caused a sudden qualitative change in the history of social thought; he explained history, understood its vitality, and predicted the future, but in addition to fulfilling the scientist's responsibility of predicting the future, he also expressed a revolutionary concept: it is not only necessary to explain nature, but also to transform nature. Mankind is no longer a slave and tool of the environment, but becomes the master of creating its own destiny. At this time, Marx became the target of attacks by all those who were keen on maintaining the old things, just like Democritus's experience before, whose works were burned by Plato himself and his students – thinkers of the Athenian slave-owning aristocracy. Starting with the revolutionary Marx, a political faction with concrete ideas appeared. These concrete ideas were based on the two great men, Marx and Engels, and developed through successive stages like Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and the new leaders of the Soviet Union and China, establishing a complete set of doctrines, or we can say, a complete set of models to follow.

The spirit of Marxism that the Cuban Revolution absorbed is the spirit when he put down science and took up revolutionary weapons; the reason why the Cuban Revolution absorbed this is not in the spirit of revision, not to oppose the doctrines after Marx, not to revive the "pure" Marx, but simply because before this, the scientist Marx was outside of history in research and thinking. After that, the revolutionary Marx was in history and fought. When we practical revolutionaries launched our struggle, we only implemented the laws predicted by the scientist Marx. On this road of resistance, in opposing the old regime structure, in relying on the people to destroy this structure, and in taking the happiness of our people as the basis of our struggle, we are only in line with the predictions of the scientific Marx. That is to say, the laws of Marxism also played a role in the process of the Cuban Revolution, regardless of whether its leaders fully believed in or recognized these laws from a theoretical point of view. It is useful to elaborate on this point again.

The Cuban Revolution should be divided into the following stages: before the landing of the "Granma"; from this landing to the victories of La Plata and Arroyo de Fielno; from those days to Ubero and the establishment of the Second Guerrilla Column; from then until the establishment of the Third and Fourth Columns, entering the Sierra Cristal Mountains, and establishing the Second Front; the April strike and its failure; repelling the great offensive; entering Las Villas.

Each of these brief historical periods represents different social concepts and different understandings of the Cuban reality in the minds of the military leaders of the Cuban Revolution. These military leaders will also show their qualities as political leaders in the future.

Before the landing of the "Granma," the dominant ideology could be described to some extent as "subjectivism," blindly believing that a mass movement would break out quickly; that the forces of Batista would be eliminated through a rapid uprising plus a spontaneous revolutionary strike, and that the dictator would finally collapse. This movement was a direct product of the People's Party, and its central slogan was "Money is Shame." That is to say, the leading ideology of the new Cuban government was administrative integrity.

However, Fidel Castro pointed out the basic conditions of the Cuban Revolution in his book "History Will Absolve Me." These conditions were almost all realized, and the revolution even surpassed these conditions. The revolution further deepened in the economic aspect, which enabled the same further deepening to be achieved in the domestic and foreign political fields.

After the landing came failure, and almost all forces were destroyed, so the guerrillas were reorganized. A small number of survivors, especially those with a strong will to fight, realized that the idea of ​​a spontaneous germination of the whole country was wrong, and understood that the struggle must be long-term and that a large number of peasants should participate. From then on, the peasants began to join the guerrillas. The initial joining of the peasants involved two battles, which were not large in terms of the number of combatants, but were very important in terms of their psychological significance, because they cleared away the psychology of despising the peasants in the core group of guerrillas composed of city people. The peasants also did not trust the core group, especially fearing the government's brutal retaliation. Two things happened during this stage, and these two things are extremely important for the interconnected factors: for the peasants, they realized that the army's brutality and all suppression were not enough to eliminate the guerrillas, but could destroy their houses, their crops, and their families. Therefore, it was a good way to escape to the guerrillas to obtain a guarantee of life; on the other hand, the guerrillas realized that it was increasingly urgent to win over the peasant masses. For this reason, it was obviously necessary to try to give them something they longed for; and what a peasant longed for most was land.

After that, the mobile stage began, and the rebel army gradually expanded its sphere of influence. At that time, it was impossible to stay in one place for a long time, but the enemy could not stay in these areas for a long time, or even enter these areas. A line that was not delineated was gradually formed between the two sides in various battles.

May 28, 1957 was a dividing day. On this day, an attack was launched on a well-equipped and well-defended garrison in Ubero. This garrison was able to receive reinforcements quickly because it was stationed by the sea and had an airport. This was one of the most intense battles, and the casualties of the troops involved in the battle reached 30%. The victory in this battle completely changed the overall situation; the rebel army had a place to move freely, from which the news of the rebel army would not leak, and the rebel army could descend to the plains extremely quickly to launch an attack on the enemy's positions.

Soon after, the first division of troops took place, and two combat columns were established. The Second Column was named the Fourth Column because of its naive desire to blur the enemy's reasons. The two columns immediately launched activities. On July 26, they attacked Estrada Palma, and five days later, they attacked Bueycito, thirty kilometers away from this place. Showing strength was already more important. They stood firm and waited for the arrival of the suppressors, and several times prevented them from climbing the mountains, establishing a vast line of no-man's-land. These areas had been ravaged by the punitive attacks of two gangs, but the original line was largely maintained.

However, the guerrillas grew stronger with the strong support of local peasants and some members of the "July 26th" Movement in the cities, enhancing their combat effectiveness and improving their combat morale. After resisting several attacks, in February 1958, the Third Column, the Almeida Column, occupied the area near Santiago, and the Raul Castro Column was the Sixth Column, which was named after our hero Frank País, who sacrificed in the previous months. At the beginning of March of that year, Raul bravely crossed the central highway, penetrated into the mountains of Mayarí, and established the Frank País Eastern Second Front.

The increasingly expanding victories of our rebel army spread through news censorship, and the people's revolutionary activities quickly reached a climax. At this very moment, it was proposed in Havana to launch a struggle across the country through a revolutionary general strike. This revolutionary general strike must smash the enemy's forces and launch a comprehensive attack on the enemy at the same time.

At this time, the role of the rebel army was to promote or perhaps launch a "stimulus needle" for the movement. In those days, our guerrilla activities increased, and legends about the heroic deeds of Camilo Cienfuegos began to appear, and at the same time, the first organized and centrally led struggle was launched in the eastern plains.

However, it was inappropriate to propose a revolutionary strike, because this strike did not understand the importance of workers' solidarity, and ignored the fact that workers should choose favorable timing when carrying out revolutionary activities. The strike wanted to launch a surprise attack, calling for a strike from the radio, without knowing that this secret was not known to the people, but was known to the detectives. The strike movement failed, and many excellent revolutionary patriots were brutally massacred.

In the history of this Cuban Revolution, or should write down a strange fact, that the writer Jules Dubois, who was raised by the US monopoly capital, knew the date of the strike in advance.

At that time, one of the most important qualitative changes occurred in the progress of the war when it was understood that victory could only be achieved by gradually strengthening the guerrillas until the enemy army was defeated on the battlefield.

At that time, the rebel army had established extensive contacts with the peasants, promulgated criminal and civil laws, upheld justice, distributed food, and collected taxes within the managed areas. The adjacent areas were also affected by the rebel army. However, the enemy was preparing for a large-scale offensive. In two months, the rebel army caused nearly a thousand casualties to the extremely demoralized invading army, and our combat capabilities increased by six hundred guns.

This shows that the enemy cannot defeat us, and there is definitely no force in Cuba that can make the mountain peaks of the Sierra Maestra surrender, nor can it make the mountains of the Frank País Eastern Second Front surrender. The tyrant's army can no longer pass on the roads of Oriente Province. After smashing the offensive, Camilo Cienfuegos was ordered to lead the Second Column, and the author of this article to lead the "Ciro Redondo" Eighth Column, to cross Camagüey and go to Las Villas to establish territory and cut off the enemy's transportation lines. Camilo's task was to continue to advance in order to realize the heroic deeds of "Antonio Maceo" again. Camilo's column was named after this hero. That is to say, this was a complete offensive from east to west.

The war showed a new characteristic at this time. The balance of power had changed in favor of the revolution. Two small columns of eighty and one hundred and forty people had to cross the Camagüey Plain in a month and a half, often under the encirclement and pursuit of an army that mobilized thousands of troops, and go to Las Villas Province and begin to complete the task of splitting the island in half.

It is sometimes strange, sometimes incomprehensible, and even sometimes unbelievable that two such small columns can defeat a well-trained and well-equipped army without communication links, without mobile forces, and without the most basic weapons of modern warfare. The fundamental problem here lies in the nature of the two armies; the more arduous the guerrillas are, the deeper they go into the harsh natural conditions, the more freely they move, the higher their morale becomes, and the greater their sense of security. At the same time, the guerrillas dare to take risks and sacrifice themselves in any case. Generally speaking, each guerrilla fighter has long put aside the question of whether he will live or die after the battle.

In the example of Cuba that we have talked about, the enemy soldiers seem to be the most despicable partners of the dictator. There is a series of vested interests from Washington down, and these soldiers are at the bottom of these vested interests, only getting some crumbs. They are prepared to defend their privileges, but they want to see how important the privileges are. Their salaries and subsidies are worth some pain and risk to them, but they are never worth their lives. If keeping these salaries requires their lives, it is best not to do it. That is to say, surrender in the face of the danger of the guerrillas. The difference between these two concepts and morale caused the crisis of December 31, 1958.

The superiority of the rebel army has become increasingly obvious. In addition, as our column arrived in Las Villas Province, it showed that the July 26th Movement was more popular with the masses than all other organizations, the Revolutionary Directorate, the Second Front of Las Villas, the People's Socialist Party, and some small guerrilla teams of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. This is largely due to the attractive qualities of its leader, Fidel Castro, but the complete correctness of the revolutionary line also played a role.

The uprising ended here. However, those who came to Havana after two years of fierce fighting in the mountains and plains of Oriente Province, in the plains of Camagüey Province, and in the mountains, plains, and cities of Las Villas Province, were ideologically completely different from when they first landed on Las Coloradas Beach or first joined the struggle. Their distrust of the peasants has turned into love and respect for the virtues of the peasants. They originally did not understand rural life at all, but now they have a clear understanding of the needs of our peasants; they originally were fascinated by statistics and theories, but now they have consolidated them with practice.

These people, with land reform first implemented in the Sierra Maestra as their banner, launched a conflict with imperialism; they understood that land reform was the foundation for building a new Cuba; they also understood that land reform would give land to all those who had been deprived of land, and expropriate those unjust possessors; they also knew that the biggest unjust possessors were those who had power in the State Department or the US government; but they had learned to overcome difficulties with a bold, courageous spirit, especially with the support of the people, and had seen the prospects of our liberation waiting for us on the other side of suffering.

In order to achieve the final ideal of our goals, we have come a long way and made considerable changes. Along with the constant qualitative changes on the battlefield, the social composition of our guerrillas has also changed, and the ideas of their leaders have also changed. Because each process and each change actually means a qualitative change in the composition, strength, and revolutionary maturity of our army. The peasants are passing on their perseverance, their spirit of hard work, their knowledge of the land, their love for the land, and their desire for land reform to the rebel army. Various types of intellectuals began to put forward theoretical concepts and also contributed their share. The workers contributed their organizational skills and their inherent ideas of solidarity and unity. Most importantly, the example of the rebel army, which has shown a force far greater than the "stinging edge," inspired the masses and made them lose their fear of the executioners.

We have never had such a clear concept of mutual influence as we do now. We can feel this mutual influence is growing. We have shown the role of armed uprisings, showing the power that a person has when he holds a weapon for self-defense and is full of determination to win, and the peasants have shown the ingenuity of the mountains, the strength necessary to live and win in the mountains, and the perseverance and self-sacrificing qualities necessary to move the fate of the people forward.

Therefore, when the rebel leaders and their entourage, bathed in the sweat of the peasants, looking at the colorful clouds in the mountains, and under the bright sunshine of the island nation, entered Havana, a new "historical period created by the people entered the winter garden."

    研究古巴革命思想意识的笔记
    （1960年10月5日发表在古巴“绿色橄榄树”杂志）	埃尔内斯托·切·格瓦拉少校
    古巴革命是一个独特的革命，有些人认为，这个革命和列宁所表达的“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动”这个革命运动最正统的前提之一不符。应该说，革命理论作为社会真实的表现并不仅仅限制在文字表述的范围内，就是说，即使不懂理论，只要能正确地说明历史现实，正确地使用参加革命的力量，也是能够进行革命的。一切革命，总有各种不同倾向的人参加，但是他们在行动方面和革命最眼前的目标方面是一致的。
    很明显，如果领导人在行动之前有充足的理论知识，只要所采纳的理论符合于现实，他们就可以避免犹豫和错误。
    古巴革命的主角没有完整的理论标准，但是也不能说，他们对今天世界上讨论的关于历史、社会、经济和革命的各种不同观点是一无所知的。
    由于对现实的深刻了解、同人民的密切联系、对解放目标的坚定以及革命实践的经验，这些领导人有可能得出一个比较完整的理论概念。
    以上所述可以当作一个小引，而本文目的是要说明一种使人人感到不解的奇怪现象：古巴革命。一小批人在遭到一支在技术和装备上大大占优势的军队的重创之后还能保存下来，然后逐渐加强，再后来在作战地区比敌人强大，再后来开进新的作战地区，在野战中最终击败敌人，虽然所拥有的军队在数量上仍处于很大的劣势，这到底是怎样可能和为什么可能的呢？这确是现代世界历史上一个值得研究的事实。
    很自然，由于我们没有经常表示对理论的适当关心，我们今天不是作为精通理论的人来解释古巴革命的真实情况，我们只想为说明这种真实情况提供一些根据。事实上，应该把古巴革命分成两个完全不同的阶段：从武装行动到1959年1月1日的阶段，从此以后的政治、经济和社会变革的阶段。
    虽然这两个阶段还可以细分为若干小阶段，但是我们将不是从历史说明的观点出发，而是从他们的领导人的革命思想通过同人民的接触而发生的演化的观点出发来理解这两个阶段。这里必须顺带谈一谈对目前世界争论最多的名词之一——马克思主义——的总的态度。如果有人问我们是不是马克思主义者，我们的态度同一个物理学家对于人们问他是不是“牛顿派”，或者一个生物学家对于人们问他是不是“巴斯德派”的态度一样。
    有些真理是明明白白的，是人人知道的，根本用不着再去讨论。是不是“马克思主义者”的问题，就同物理学中是不是“牛顿派”或生物学中是不是“巴斯德派”的性质一样。必须考虑到，新的事实固然决定新的概念，也决不会使过去的事物失去其真理的部分。例如，爱因斯坦的相对论和普朗克的“量子”论同牛顿的发现的关系就是这样；他们的发现丝毫无损于这位英国学者的伟大。由于牛顿，才得以把物理学推进到取得空间的新概念。这位英国学者是物理学发展中的必要环节。
    社会政治科学的发展像其他领域一样是一个很长的历史过程，它的各个环节相互衔接，不断增加，联结和完善起来。在人类的开始，只存在中国、阿拉伯或者印度的数学；而今天数学已经没有疆界了。在人类的历史中，有一个希腊的毕达戈拉斯、一个意大利的伽利略，一个英国的牛顿，一个德国的高斯，一个俄国的罗巴切夫斯基，一个爱因斯坦等等。在社会政治科学方面也是这样，从德谟克利特到马克思，各个时代的无数思想家以自己独到的研究逐渐丰富了这些科学并积累了大量的经验和学说。
    马克思的功绩是，他在社会思想史上引起了突然的质变；他解说历史，理解它的活力，预见未来，但是除尽到了科学家的预见未来的职责以外，他还表达了一个革命概念：不仅必须解说自然，而且必须改造自然。人类不再成为环境的奴隶和工具，而变成创造自己命运的主人。在这个时候，马克思就成为一切热中于保持旧事物的人攻击的目标，像以前德谟克利特的遭遇一样，德谟克利特的作品被拍拉图本人和他的学生——雅典奴隶主贵族的思想家所焚毁。从革命的马克思开始，出现了一个有具体思想的政治派别，这些具体思想以马克思和恩格斯这两位伟人为依据，通过连续各个阶段得到像列宁、斯大林、毛泽东以及苏联和中国新领导人的发展，确立了一整套学说，或可以说，一整套遵循的榜样。
    古巴革命所吸取的马克思的精神是他放下科学而拿起革命武器时的精神；古巴革命之所以吸取这一点，不是本着修改的精神、不是为了反对马克思以后的学说，不是为了复活“纯粹”的马克思，而仅仅是因为在此以前科学家的马克思处于历史之外在研究和思考。之后，革命的马克思才处在历史之内进行了斗争。我们实际革命者展开我们的斗争时只不过实行了科学家的马克思所预见的规律，在这条反抗的道路上，在反对旧的政权结构方面，在依靠人民来摧毁这个结构方面，在把本国人民的幸福作为我们斗争的基础方面，我们仅仅是符合科学的马克思的预言。这就是说，马克思主义的规律在古巴革命的过程中也起作用，不管它的领袖们是否从理论观点上完全信奉或者认识这些规律。再一次详细论述这一点是有好处的。
    应该把古巴革命分成以下几个阶段：“格拉玛号”的登陆之前；从这次登陆到拉普拉塔和阿罗约德菲埃尔诺的胜利；从这些日子到乌贝罗和成立游击队第二纵队；从那时起到建立第三和第四纵队、进入克里斯达耳山区和成立第二战线；4月罢工及其失败；击退大攻势；进入拉斯维利亚。
    其中每一个短暂的历史时期都代表着古巴革命的军事领袖思想各种不同的社会概念和对古巴现实的各种不同的认识。这些军事领袖将来也会表现出他们作为政治领导人的条件。
    在“格拉玛号”登陆之前，占统治地位的思想在一定程度上可以称做“主观主义”，盲目相信会很快地爆发这样的群众性的活动；通过一次迅速的起义加上自发的革命罢工来消灭巴蒂斯塔的力量，而最后使这个独裁者垮台。这个运动是人民党的直接产物，它的中心口号是“金钱即是耻辱”。也就是说作为古巴新政府的主导思想就是行政管理上的廉洁。
    但是，菲德尔·卡斯特罗在“历史是我的鉴定人”一书中指出了古巴革命的各个基本条件，这些条件几乎全部得到实现，并且革命还超越了这些条件，在经济方面革命进一步深入发展，这一切就使得在国内外政治领域中取得了同样的进一步的深入。
    在登陆之后接着是失败，力量几乎全部被摧毁，于是重新组合成游击队。一小批幸存者，尤其是富有斗争意志的幸存者体会到对全国自发的萌芽的想法是错误的，理解到斗争必须是长期的，应该有大批的农民参加。从此农民就开始加入游击队，最初加入的农民进行了两次战斗，就战斗员人数来讲并不算多，就其心理意义来讲却十分重要，因为在由城里人组成的游击队中心小组中扫清了瞧不起农民的心理。农民们也不相信中心小组，特别是怕政府野蛮的报复。这个阶段出现了两件事情，这两件事情对于互相联系着的因素是极为重要的：对于农民来说，他们了解到，军队的残暴和一切镇压都不足以消灭游击队，但却能够毁掉他们的房子、他们的庄稼和他们的家庭，因此逃到游击队那里获得生命的保障倒是一个很好的办法；另一方面游击队了解到愈来愈迫切需要争取农民群众，为此，显然需要尽力给予他们某些他们所渴望的东西；而一个农民所迫切想念的不外是土地。
    之后就开始了流动阶段，起义军逐渐扩大了势力范围。当时还不能在一个地方呆很久，但是敌军也不能在这些地区呆很久，甚至不能进入这些地区。各次战斗中逐步在双方间形成了一种没有划定的战线。
    1957年5月28日是一个分界日，这一天在乌贝罗对一队装备精良、掩护相当好的城防军发起了攻击，这个城防部队由于驻扎在海边并且占有机场因而可以很快地接到援兵。这是一场最激烈的战役之一，投入战斗的军队伤亡达30％。这场战役的胜利完全改变了全局；起义军已经有了可自由行动的地方，从这里不会漏出起义军的消息，而起义军可以极为迅速地下到平原地区对敌人阵地发起进攻。
    不久之后，就进行了第一次分兵，建立了两个战斗纵队。第二纵队，由于很幼稚地想模糊敌人的理由取名叫第四纵队。这两个纵队立刻就展开了活动。7月26日进攻艾斯特拉达·巴尔马，五天以后，进攻离这个地方三十公里的布埃依西斗。显示力量已经是更为重要的事了，站稳脚跟等待着镇压者的到来，并几次阻住了他们登上山区的企图，建立了广大的无人区的战线，这些地区曾为两批匪帮的惩罚性的进攻所蹂躏，但是大体上仍然保持了原来的阵线。
    但是，游击队由于当地农民以及城市中“七·二六”运动的某些成员的大力支援壮大了他们的力量，增强了战斗力并提高了他们的战斗情绪。在抵挡住了几次进攻后，在1958年2月第三纵队，即阿尔米达的纵队就占了圣地亚哥附近地区，劳尔·卡斯特罗的纵队是第六纵队，这个纵队是以我们的英雄佛拉克·巴依斯命名的，佛拉克·巴依斯在前几个月牺牲了。劳尔在那一年3月初英勇地穿过了中央公路，深入到马拉里的山区并建立了佛拉克·巴依斯东方第二战线。
    我们起义部队日益扩大的战果透过新闻检查传播出去，人民的革命活动迅速达到高潮。就在此时此刻，在哈瓦那提出了通过革命总罢工在全国范围内展开斗争，这一革命总罢工必须打碎敌人的力量，同时全面地向敌人进攻。
    在这个时候，起义军的作用是促进或者也许是发动运动的一根“刺激针”。在这些日子里我们的游击队活动增加了，开始有了关于加米洛·西恩富戈斯的英雄事迹的传说，同时开始第一次在东部平原地区进行有组织的和有中央领导的斗争。
    但是，提出革命的罢工是不适当的，因为这次罢工不了解工人团结的重要性，忽视了工人在进行革命活动时要选择有利的时机。罢工想来一次突击，从电台号召罢工，而不知道这个秘密没有被人民知道，却被警探知道了。罢工运动失败了，许多优秀的革命爱国者被残酷地屠杀了。
    在这次古巴革命的历史上，或者应该注下一笔一件奇怪的事实，就是美国垄断资本豢养的文人朱勒斯·杜波依斯事先已知道要发动罢工的日期。
    在懂得了只有逐步壮大游击队的力量，直到在战场上击败敌人军队才能取得胜利的真理时，在战争的进展上发生了最重要的质变之一。
    那时起义军已和农民建立了广泛的联系，颁布了刑法和民法，申张正义，分配了粮食，并在管理的地区之内征收了税收。毗邻的地区也受到了起义军的影响，但是，敌人在准备大规模的进攻，在两个月中，起义军使士气极为低落的侵略军伤亡近千人，我们的战斗能力中又增加了六百条枪。
    这就表明了，敌军是不能击败我们的，在古巴肯定没有一种力量能够使马埃斯特腊山的山尖屈服，也不能使佛拉克·巴依斯东方第二战线的山峦屈服，暴君的军队已经不能在奥连特省的道路上通行了。粉碎了进攻之后，就命卡米洛·西恩富戈斯带领第二纵队，以本文的作者带领“西罗·瑞东多”第八纵队，穿过卡马圭，到拉斯维利亚斯去建立地盘，切断敌人的交通线。卡米洛的任务是继续挺进，以便再度实现“安东尼奥·马塞奥”这个英雄人物的伟绩，卡米洛的纵队就是以这个英雄的名字命名的，这就是说，这是一次整个的由东到西的进攻。
    战争在这时表现了一个新的特点，力量对比发生了有利于革命的变化，两支八十和一百四十人的小纵队要在一个半月之内穿过卡马圭平原，经常在一支调动了几千兵力军队的包围和追击之下前往拉斯维利亚斯省并开始完成把这个岛劈成两半的任务。
    两支这么小型的纵队在没有通讯联络、没有机动力量、没有现代战争中最基本的武器的情况下，能够击败训练有素、装备精良的军队，这件事有时是奇怪的，有时是不能理解的，甚至有时是令人难以置信的。这里根本问题在于双方军队的性质；游击队越是艰苦，越是深入到恶劣的自然条件中，他们就越是活动自如，他们的士气就越发高涨，他们的安全感就更大。同时在任何情况下游击队都敢于冒险和自我牺牲，一般说来，每个游击队员对于战斗结束后个人是死是活，是早已置之度外了。
    在我们谈到的古巴这个例子上看来，敌人的士兵是独裁者最卑鄙的伙伴。自华盛顿而下有一连串的既得利益者，这些士兵在这些既得利益者中名列最后，只得到一些面包屑。他们准备保卫他们的特权，但是他们要看特权的重要性如何。他们的薪饷和补贴值得他们去受些痛苦和风险，而永远也不值得他们牺牲生命，如果保持这些薪饷必须以生命做代价的话，最好是不干，即是说，在游击队的危险面前屈服。这两种概念和士气的差别造成了1958年12月31日的危机。
    起义军的优势已经日益明显了。此外，随着我们的纵队到达了拉斯维利亚斯省，情况表明，7月26日运动比其它所有的组织，革命指导委员会，拉斯维利亚斯第二战线，人民社会党和古巴革命党的一些小型游击队更受群众拥护。这很大程度上是由于它的领袖菲德尔·卡斯特罗具有吸引人的品德，但是革命路线的完全正确性也起了作用。
    起义至此结束，然而那些经过两年在奥连特省山区和平原、在卡马圭省平原、在拉斯维利亚斯省的山区、平原和城市中的激烈战斗之后来到哈瓦那的人，在思想上已经完全不同于他们最初在拉斯科劳拉达斯海滩登陆或者最初参加斗争的时候了。他们对农民的不信任已经转变成对农民的美德的热爱和尊重，他们原先完全不了解农村生活，这时已转变为清楚了解我们农民的需要了；他们原先迷恋统计数字和理论，这时已经用实践来加以巩固。
    这些人以首先在马埃斯特腊山实行的土地改革为旗帜，同帝国主义展开了冲突；他们懂得土地改革是建立新古巴的基础；他们也懂得土地改革将把土地交给所有被剥夺了土地的人，而剥夺那些不正义的占有者；他们也知道，最大的不正义的占有者也就是那些在国务院或美国政府中有势力的人；但是他们已学会了以大胆、勇敢的精神，特别是依靠人民的支持，去战胜困难，并且已经看到了在苦难的另一面等待着我们的解放的前途。
    为了达到我们目标的最后理想，已经走了不少路，发生了相当大的变化。随着在战场上不断发生的质的变化，我们游击队的社会成份也发生了变化，他们领袖的思想也有了转变。因为每个进程，每个变化实际上都意味着我们军队的成份、力量和革命的成熟性的质的变化。农民正在把他们的毅力、他们吃苦耐劳的精神、他们对土地的知识、他们对土地的热爱和他们对土地改革的渴望传给起义军。各种类型的知识分子开始提出理论的概念，也贡献了他们的一分力量。工人贡献出了他们的组织性和他们固有的团结与统一的思想。其中最重要的是起义军的榜样，他们已经显示出远比“刺人的锋芒”更为巨大的力量，这种教训鼓舞了群众，使他们失去了对刽子手的恐惧。
    对于相互影响我们从来没有像现在这样明确的概念。我们可以感到这种互相影响在日益增长，我们显示了武装起义的作用，表明一个人当他为了自卫而握有武器并充满胜利决心时所具有的力量，而农民表现出了山地的机智、为了在山地生活和取胜而必须的力量，和为了使人民的命运向前发展所必须有的那种坚毅不拔和自我牺牲的品质。
    因此，当起义领袖和他的随从沐浴着农民的汗水，瞻视着群山彩云，在岛国的灿烂阳光下，进入哈瓦那时，一个新的“人民开创的历史时期迈入了冬天的花园”。
