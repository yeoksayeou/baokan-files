    Donghu Farm Experience Blossoms Throughout the County: Shaoxing Triples Area Under Triple Cropping System
    (Our dispatch from Hangzhou, November 4th) Zhejiang's Shaoxing County has persistently promoted the high-yield experience of Donghu Farm's new triple cropping system, expanding the county's new triple cropping area from 50,000 mu in 1957 to 210,000 mu this year, raising the multiple cropping index to 265.6%. Currently, a vigorous and down-to-earth mass movement to learn from Donghu, catch up with Donghu, and surpass Donghu, focusing on planting more and better spring rapeseed, is flourishing throughout the county.
    Donghu Farm successfully trial-planted a new triple cropping system (spring rapeseed - double-cropped rice) in 1957, with the farm's annual yield per unit area under the new system increasing by 32% compared to double-cropped rice with green manure. After the Shaoxing County Party Committee discovered this advanced model, it treated it with great enthusiasm. The county party secretary personally summarized the farm's experience in planting the new triple cropping system and began promoting it throughout the county. Since last winter, sixteen county-wide on-site meetings have been held at Donghu Farm, promoting Donghu Farm's advanced experience step by step. Party committees at all levels also organized over 80,000 secretaries, cadres, and commune member representatives to visit and learn from Donghu Farm.
    In promoting Donghu Farm's advanced experience, the Shaoxing County Party Committee especially emphasized doing a good job in political and ideological work, deeply resolving the ideological understanding problems of cadres and commune members. For example, at the beginning of the mass movement to "learn from, catch up with, and surpass" Donghu Farm, many production team cadres and commune members believed that Donghu Farm had superior natural conditions, saying that "trying to surpass Donghu Farm is like hitting a rock with tofu, extremely difficult," and lacked confidence in the large-scale promotion of the new triple cropping advanced experience. In response to this thinking, the county party committee mobilized cadres and the masses throughout the county to carry out a great debate on "Do we want to catch up? Can we surpass?" To make the debate thorough and convincing, the county party committee also specifically summarized the experience of Xuanxi Production Team of Fusheng Commune, which had poor natural conditions but achieved high yields by implementing the new triple cropping system. The vivid facts profoundly educated the people, liberated their minds, and greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members to "learn from, catch up with, and surpass" Donghu Farm.
    The large-scale promotion of the new triple cropping system is a major reform in the cropping system, involving a wide range of aspects and requiring the resolution of many problems. Responsible comrades of the county party committee and the commune party committees all went deep into the grassroots, eating, living, working, and discussing with the commune members, following the mass line, and solving the practical problems one by one. For example, after the large-scale promotion of the new triple cropping system, the contradiction between labor shortage and seasonal tension became very acute. To solve this problem, in addition to taking measures to ensure that 82% of the strong labor force was used for the front line of production, the county party committee also mobilized the masses to vigorously carry out tool reform, promoting the use of more than 120,000 new-style tools in major harvesting and planting links such as cutting, threshing, transporting, plowing, and sowing. At the same time, they also conscientiously summarized the experience of advanced areas, listened to the opinions of the masses, and, in the spirit of "no land idle at any time, no time wasted, full utilization of labor, striving for high yields for every crop," made great efforts in variety selection. To solve the fertilizer problem and meet the needs of expanding the new triple cropping, the county party committee, based on local conditions, mobilized the masses to vigorously run field-side livestock farms. The county has now raised more than 244,000 pigs, vigorously promotes green manure and river weeds, and has cultivated more than 63,000 mu of revolutionary grass in the big river.
    In the mass movement to promote the Donghu Farm experience, one hundred pacesetter production teams in all communes throughout the county were linked up with Donghu Farm for competition. Doumen, Mashan, Fusheng and other communes also formed a chain competition network centered on the pacesetter production teams linked with Donghu Farm, forming a mass movement of pacesetters catching up with pacesetters, and the whole people catching up with pacesetters. The county's winter planting preparation work has been done better than in any previous year. Each mu of spring rapeseed field has accumulated about forty dan of fertilizer, all seeds have been secured, tool preparation has also started earlier than in previous years, and winter planting plans have been universally implemented down to the team level, and in some cases, even to the field. The broad masses of commune members are determined to strive for a spring rapeseed harvest next year that surpasses any previous year.

### 东湖农场经验在全县开花  绍兴三熟制面积扩大三倍

    东湖农场经验在全县开花
    绍兴三熟制面积扩大三倍
    本报杭州4日电　浙江绍兴县坚持不懈推广东湖农场新三熟制的高产经验，使全县新三熟制落实面积由1957年的五万亩扩大到今年的二十一万亩，复种指数提高到265.6％。目前，一个轰轰烈烈、踏踏实实的以多种、种好春花为内容的学东湖、赶东湖、超东湖的群众运动，正在全县蓬勃展开。
    东湖农场在1957年试种新三熟（春花——连作稻）成功，全场新三熟制的全年单位产量比绿肥田连作稻增产三成二。中共绍兴县委发现这个先进典型以后，就满腔热情地对待，由县委书记亲自动手总结了这个场种植新三熟制的经验，开始在全县推广。从去年冬天以来，先后在东湖农场召开了十六次全县性的现场会议，一环一环地推广了东湖农场的先进经验；各公社党委也先后组织了各级书记、干部、社员代表八万多人次到东湖农场参观学习。
    在推广东湖农场的先进经验中，绍兴县委特别重视做好政治思想工作，深入解决干部、社员的思想认识问题。例如在“学、赶、超”东湖农场的群众运动开始时，不少生产队的干部和社员认为东湖农场自然条件优越，说什么“想超过东湖农场是豆腐碰石头，难上难”，对大面积推广新三熟的先进经验缺乏信心。针对这种思想，县委发动全县干部和群众开展了“要不要赶？能不能超？”的大鸣大放大辩论。为使辩论深透，以理服人，县委还专门总结了自然条件不好、实行新三熟制得到高产的富盛公社玄溪生产队的经验。活生生的事实深刻地教育了人们，解放了思想，大大鼓舞了广大社员“学、赶、超”东湖农场的积极性。
    大面积推广新三熟制，是耕作制度上的重大改革，涉及的方面很广，需要解决的问题很多。县委和各公社党委的负责同志都深入基层，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，走群众路线，把实际问题一个一个地加以解决。例如在大面积推广新三熟制以后，劳动力不足和季节紧张的矛盾显得很尖锐。为了解决这个问题，县委除了采取措施保证82％的精壮劳力用于生产第一线以外，并且发动群众大闹工具改革，在割、打、运、耕、种等主要收种环节上推广使用了各种新式工具十二万多件，同时还认真总结先进地区的经验，听取群众的意见，本着“土地一时不空，时间一刻不松，劳力充分利用，力争熟熟高产”的精神，在品种搭配上大做文章。为了解决肥料问题，满足扩种新三熟的需要，县委根据本地具体情况，发动群众大办田头畜牧场，全县已养猪二十万四千多头，大搞绿肥下水，在大江里养活了六万三千多亩革命草。
    在推广东湖农场经验的群众运动中，全县各公社有一百个标兵生产队和东湖农场挂钩竞赛。斗门、马山、富盛等公社还以和东湖农场挂钩的标兵生产队为中心，组织了一个连环竞赛网，形成了一个标兵赶标兵、全民赶标兵的群众运动。全县冬种准备工作做得比以往任何一年都好，每亩春花田已积肥四十担左右，种子全部有了着落，工具准备也比往年动手早，冬种规划已经普遍落实到小队，有的已经落实到田，广大社员决心力争明年春花收成超过以往任何一年。
