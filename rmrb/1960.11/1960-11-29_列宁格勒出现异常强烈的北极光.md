    Leningrad Experiences Unusually Strong Aurora Borealis

    Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, 27th (TASS) -- Residents of Leningrad witnessed a phenomenon rarely seen at this latitude during this season: an exceptionally intense aurora borealis.

    The aurora borealis is a faint light that appears in the sky near the Arctic. The light is white, red, and green, resembling colorful brocade, garlands, and flames, making it very beautiful. It is generally believed that the aurora borealis is caused by increased solar activity.

    Professor Krat, of the Pulkovo Observatory, said that this unusual aurora borealis was the result of a huge solar chromospheric eruption. This eruption is one of the aftereffects of the solar storms that occurred in the past two to three years. These were caused by the peak of solar activity that occurred between the winter of 1957 and 1958. This peak was unprecedented in its intensity, at least the highest in nearly three hundred years. It can be expected that solar activity will decrease to its lowest level by 1964.

    列宁格勒出现异常强烈的北极光
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒27日讯：列宁格勒人看到了一次这个季节在这个纬度上十分稀有的现象——异常强烈的北极光。
    北极光是在北极附近天空中出现的一种薄光。光呈白色、红色、绿色，像五彩缤纷的彩绸、花环和火焰，非常美观。一般认为，北极光是由太阳活动加强造成的。
    普尔科沃天文台克拉特教授说，这次异常的北极光是太阳上巨大的色球爆发的结果。这一次爆发是近两三年来太阳上出现的风暴余波之一。它们是由1957年冬到1958年间出现的太阳活动高峰引起的。这次高峰就其强度说来是空前的，至少是近三百年来最高的一次。可以预期，到1964年，太阳活动将降到最低程度。
