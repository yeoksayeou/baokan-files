Australian Communist Party Central Political Bureau Member Aarons Writes Article Pointing Out That the Chinese People are Advancing Under the Guidance of Marxism-Leninism
Imperialists and reactionaries hate China because they see in China's Great Leap Forward a harbinger of their inevitable demise.
The working class and progressive people of all countries welcome China's great achievements and see China's resurgence as a harbinger of good fortune for the world.
The October issue of the Australian Communist Party's organ, "Communist Review," published an article by Laurie Aarons, a member of the Central Political Bureau of the Australian Communist Party, entitled "Great Events."

The article begins by stating that the proclamation of the People's Republic of China was the result of one of the greatest revolutions in history. This revolution was a long and epic struggle in which Chinese workers and peasants created many heroic deeds during more than two decades of armed struggle.

The Chinese revolutionary struggle was directed against the forces of old China, namely the landlords and bureaucratic capitalists. But these forces were not the only enemies of the Chinese people. Their irreconcilable enemy was imperialism, which invaded China in the 19th century. For more than a century, the imperialists divided China's exhausted body, squabbling among themselves like vultures, but united against the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. The imperialists supported the corrupt and reactionary ruling classes, using them to suppress the masses while they exploited and plundered China.

Therefore, the heroic struggle of the Chinese people was undermined by savage violence and slaughter. No matter how frequently the Chinese masses rose up against imperialism and feudalism, they were defeated, pushed back into destitution, extreme backwardness, and the rule of bayonets and machine guns.

Later, great changes took place in the world. The great Russian Revolution of 1917 broke through the imperialist front and established the first state of workers and peasants.

The Russian Revolution had a tremendous impact on the struggle of the Chinese people. Mao Zedong said, "The October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China."

After pointing out that the Communist Party of China led the people through a long struggle to finally build the People's Republic of China, the article says that there are two opposing views on the future of this new country.

On the one hand, the imperialists believed that the People's Republic of China would collapse. Former U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall said that because "China itself does not have raw materials and industrial resources," it would not be able to become a first-rate power in the foreseeable future.

Acheson, who succeeded Marshall as Secretary of State, ridiculed the Communists' "promise" to solve the "food" problem. He predicted that no government would be able to solve this problem.

The other view was that of the Communist Party. In June 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese people will see that once the fate of China is in the hands of the people themselves, China will shine brilliantly like the sun rising in the East, rapidly sweeping away the mud and filth left by the reactionary government, healing the wounds of war, and building a brand-new, strong, and truly people's republic."

Eleven years is a short period of time in the history of any people, especially in the history of China with its six thousand years of civilization. But in these eleven years, the Chinese people have proven Mao Zedong to be correct and have completely dismayed the spokesmen of imperialism.

The article emphasizes that the Chinese people, inspired by the Communist Party of China and guided by Marxism-Leninism, are marching forward.

The article goes on to say that China has solved the problem of food. Agriculture has made great progress, and the output of grain and other food crops is much higher than at any time in Chinese history. Indeed, China's progress in agriculture has surprised experts everywhere, many of whom did not believe such progress was possible.

They encountered and overcame natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and insect plagues. In the old society, such disasters used to cause millions of people to starve to death, but the disasters of 1959—the largest in a century—were overcome.

China's agriculture not only feeds the people but also expands the production of cash crops, helping China's large-scale industrial development.

The article says that China's industry is continuing to develop at an accelerating pace. Only twelve years after Marshall said that China could not become a first-rate power in the foreseeable future, China is already a first-rate power.

The development of Chinese industry is astonishing. China has leapt from an insignificant producer of basic materials such as steel, coal, electricity, and industrial machinery to the ranks of the world's major producers.

The article points out that along with the industrial and agricultural revolutions, China has also carried out a great cultural revolution. China, not long ago known for its large number of illiterates and low levels of education and science, is now educating the broad masses and training thousands of scientists, technicians, and teachers.

The tremendous development of industry, agriculture, science, and culture has changed the face of China. This country, with a quarter of the world's population, used to be a neglected country in world affairs. Now, all this has changed. China is now a great power whose opinions must be heeded. China's destiny will never again be decided by others; it will be decided by the Chinese people themselves.

This changed situation is welcomed by the working class and progressive people of all countries. They see China's resurgence as a harbinger of good fortune for the world—a world that has long been divided into oppressor nations and oppressed nations.

However, there is a contrasting assessment of China's new situation. This is the position of the imperialists and reactionaries of all countries, who correctly see in China's Great Leap Forward a harbinger of imperialism's inevitable demise. They fear and hate China, not only because of China's progress, but also because China is a shining example of socialism, especially for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

This is the reason for the fierce anti-China propaganda campaign, and why imperialist spokesmen like Eisenhower and Menzies issue a large number of lies and slanders every day through newspapers, radio, and television.

The article says that the people's communes in rural China arose from the demands of the peasants themselves. Since the land reform, China's 500 million peasants have understood that large-scale voluntary cooperation is necessary to solve the food problem, which self-righteous reactionaries claim is unsolvable.

The article emphasizes that the Communist Party of China leads and educates the peasants, adopting a mass line leadership method. The Party synthesized the opinions and experiences of the peasants, and Chairman Mao Zedong studied the experience of the first communes, formulating correct policies and organizational forms to establish communes throughout the country.

Reactionaries everywhere spread lies about forced collectivization. However, all those who have visited China, whether Communists or capitalists, have been convinced by what they have seen with their own eyes that the main characteristic of the Chinese people today is their boiling enthusiasm, their vitality, creativity, and initiative.

The article says that the most despicable slander against China is that it opposes peaceful coexistence and that it wants war and threatens peace.

The article points out that China first formulated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence with India. China's entire foreign policy is a policy of actively fighting for peaceful coexistence. Premier Zhou Enlai has once again proposed to the countries along the Pacific coast, including the United States, the conclusion of a Pacific Peace Pact.

The article says that the People's Republic of China firmly upholds peace, calmly carries out socialist construction, and exposes the United States' policy toward China as a threat to world peace. This threat arises from the imperialist nature of U.S. monopoly capitalism, and from its entire history of policies toward China and other Asian countries. However, the era of imperialism is coming to an end, and no matter what the U.S. rulers do, they cannot impose their will on China.

The article goes on to say that China has many important tasks to accomplish in building socialism. Chairman Mao Zedong has already said this. However, China also has many favorable conditions—such as its vast territory and natural resources. However, the greatest favorable condition is precisely the Chinese people, who are building a glorious future with labor and struggle.

The article points out that the imperialists are particularly worried about further evidence confirming the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, confirming that it can guide the struggle of the working people to build a new society and a new world without capitalist imperialism.

The article emphasizes that the Communist Party of China, in socialist construction as in the long revolutionary struggle, creatively applies Marxism-Leninism to Chinese conditions. China has developed the "walking on two legs" policy, that is, developing both large and small industries and using both indigenous and foreign methods simultaneously.

Under Chinese conditions, the Chinese Communists have established rural and urban communes to represent China's new socialist relations of production. In the struggle to establish socialist ideology, they launched rectification campaigns, conducted extensive discussions and debates on ideological issues, and implemented the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy in culture and art.

The article concludes by saying that the Australian Communist Party has always supported the struggle of the Chinese people. Comrade Sharkey described some of the movements we carried out in support of the Chinese revolution. These struggles were carried out in the spirit of great proletarian internationalism. They are entirely in the interests of the Australian working class. Today, the Australian Communist Party upholds internationalism, seeks friendship with China, supports the recognition of its rights in the United Nations, and opposes the imperialist anti-China propaganda campaign.

### 澳共中央政治局委员阿隆斯著文指出  中国人民在马克思列宁主义指导下迈进

    澳共中央政治局委员阿隆斯著文指出
    中国人民在马克思列宁主义指导下迈进
    帝国主义者和反动派仇恨中国，是因为从中国的大跃进中看到他们注定灭亡的前兆
    各国工人阶级和进步人士欢迎中国的巨大成就，并且认为中国的复兴是世界的吉兆
    澳大利亚共产党机关刊物“共产主义评论”10月号发表了澳共中央政治局委员阿隆斯写的一篇题为
  “伟大事件”的文章。
    文章首先说，中华人民共和国的宣告成立是历史上最伟大的革命之一的结果。这个革命是一场长期的史诗般的斗争，在这个革命中，中国工人和农民在二十多年的武装斗争中创造了许多可歌可泣的英雄事迹。
    中国革命斗争是对旧中国的势力，即地主和官僚资本家进行的。但是这些势力并不是中国人民的唯一敌人。他们不共戴天的敌人是帝国主义，帝国主义于十九世纪侵入中国。一百多年来，帝国主义者瓜分了中国的筋疲力尽的躯体，在他们自己之间像兀鹰一样进行争吵，但却一致反对中国人民的革命斗争。帝国主义者支持腐朽反动的统治阶级，利用它来镇压群众，同时他们剥削和掠夺中国。
    因此，中国人民的英勇斗争遭到了野蛮的暴力和屠杀的破坏。不管中国群众多么频繁地起来反对帝国主义和封建主义，他们都遭到失败，被推回到赤贫、极端落后状态和刺刀与机枪的统治之下。
    后来世界发生了伟大的变化。1917年伟大的俄国革命冲破了帝国主义的阵线，建立了第一个工农国家。
    俄国革命对中国人民的斗争产生了巨大的影响。毛泽东说，“十月革命一声炮响，给中国送来了马克思列宁主义。”
    文章在指出中国共产党领导人民经过长期斗争最后建成了中华人民共和国后说，但是，对这个新国家的前途有着两种相反的看法。
    一方面，帝国主义者认为，中华人民共和国将垮台。美国前国务卿马歇尔将军说，由于“中国自己没有原料和工业资源”，所以不能够在可以预见的将来变成一个一等强国。
    继马歇尔之后任国务卿的艾奇逊嘲笑了共产党人解决“吃饭”问题的“诺言”。他预言，没有一个政府能够解决这个问题。
    另一种看法是共产党的看法。1949年6月毛泽东主席说：“中国人民将会看见，中国的命运一经操在人民自己的手里，中国就将如太阳升起在东方那样，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照大地，迅速地荡涤反动政府留下来的污泥浊水，治好战争的创伤，建设起一个崭新的强盛的名副其实的人民共和国。”
    在任何人民的历史上，尤其是具有六千年文明的中国的历史上，十一年是很短的一段时间。但是在这十一年里，中国人民已经证明毛泽东是正确的，并使帝国主义的发言人完全惊惶失措。
    文章强调指出，中国人民在中国共产党的鼓舞下和在马克思列宁主义的指导下，正在向前迈进。
    文章接着说，中国已经解决了吃饭问题。农业取得了巨大的进展，谷物和其他粮食作物的产量比中国历史上任何时候都高得多。的确，中国在农业方面的进展使各地的专家感到吃惊，其中许多人不相信这样的进展是可能的。
    他们遇到了诸如旱灾、水灾和虫灾等自然灾害，并战胜了它们。在旧社会，以前这样的灾害使得千百万人饿死，而1959年的灾害——一世纪以来最大的灾害——则被克服了。
    中国的农业不仅使人民有饭吃，而且还在扩大经济作物的生产，帮助中国的大规模工业发展。
    文章说，中国的工业正以日益加快的速度继续发展着。仅仅在马歇尔说中国不能在可以预见的将来成为一等强国以后十二年，中国已经是一个一等强国了。
    中国工业的发展是惊人的。中国已经从钢、煤、电和工业机器等基本物资的微不足道的生产国跃进到世界主要生产国的行列。
    文章指出，在工业和农业革命的同时，中国还进行了伟大的文化革命。中国不久以前还是一个以有大批文盲、教育和科学水平低下著称的国家，现在它正在使广大群众受教育，培养成千上万的科学家、技术人员和教师。
    工业、农业、科学和文化的巨大发展改变了中国的面貌。这个有着世界人口四分之一的国家过去是世界事务中被忽视的国家。现在，这一切都改变了。中国现在是个伟大的强国，它的意见必须受到注意。中国的命运将永远不会再由别人决定；它将由中国人民自己决定。
    这个改变了的情况受到各国工人阶级和进步人士的欢迎。他们认为中国的复兴是世界——长期以来分为压迫民族和被压迫民族的世界——的吉兆。
    但是，对中国的新情况有一种相反的评价。这是帝国主义者和各国的反动派的立场，他们从中国的大跃进中正确地看到帝国主义注定灭亡的前兆。他们惧怕和痛恨中国，这不仅是由于中国的进展，而且是由于中国是一个光辉的社会主义榜样，特别是对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民的榜样。
    这就是进行激烈的反华宣传运动的原因，就是像艾森豪威尔和孟席斯这样的帝国主义发言人每天通过报纸、电台和电视发出大量谎言和诬蔑的原因。
    文章说，中国农村人民公社是由于农民自己的要求而产生的。从土地改革起，中国的五亿农民就懂得必须进行大规模的自愿的合作，努力以解决自作聪明的反动分子声称是不能解决的粮食问题。
    文章强调说，中国共产党领导和教育农民，采取群众路线的领导方法。党综合了农民的意见和经验，毛泽东主席研究了第一批公社的经验，制定出正确的政策和组织形式，以在全国范围内建立公社。
    各地的反动派散播关于强制组织化的谎言。但是，所有访问过中国的人，不管是共产党人还是资本家，都由于自己亲眼看到的东西而相信中国人民今天的主要特点是他们的沸腾的热情，他们的生气勃勃、创造性和积极性。
    文章说，对中国最卑鄙的诬蔑是说中国反对和平共处，说中国要战争和威胁和平。
    文章指出，中国首先与印度一起制定了和平共处五项原则。中国的整个外交政策是为争取和平共处而积极斗争的政策。周恩来总理再次向太平洋沿岸各国，包括美国在内，提出了缔结太平洋和平公约的建议。
    文章说，中华人民共和国坚决拥护和平，从容地进行社会主义建设，并揭露美国的对华政策是对世界和平的威胁。这个威胁是由于美国垄断资本主义的帝国主义性质，由于它对中国和对亚洲其他国家的政策的整个历史而产生的。但是，帝国主义的时代正在结束，不管美国统治者怎么做，他们都不能把他们的意志强加在中国身上。
    文章接着说，中国在建设社会主义方面有许多重大任务要完成。毛泽东主席已经说过这一点。但是，中国也有许多有利条件——例如它的广大幅员和自然资源。然而最大的有利条件恰恰是中国人民，他们正在用劳动和斗争建设光荣的未来。
    文章指出，帝国主义者特别担心有进一步的证据证实马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，证实它能指导劳动人民为争取建立一个新社会和一个没有资本主义帝国主义的新世界而进行的斗争。
    文章强调指出，中国共产党在社会主义建设中就像在长期的革命斗争中一样，创造性地把马克思列宁主义运用到中国情况中。中国发展了“两条腿走路”的方针，即同时发展大小工业和运用土洋方法。
    在中国的条件下，中国共产党人建立了农村和城市公社，来表示中国新的社会主义的生产关系。在为树立社会主义思想而进行的斗争中，他们开展了整风运动，对思想问题展开广泛的讨论和辩论，并且在文化艺术方面实行“百花齐放”政策。
    文章最后说，澳大利亚共产党一直支持中国人民的斗争。夏基同志描述了我们为支持中国革命而进行的一些运动。这些斗争是本着伟大的无产阶级国际主义精神进行的。它们完全符合澳大利亚工人阶级的利益。今天，澳大利亚共产党维护国际主义，它谋求与中国的友谊，支持承认它在联合国的权利，反对帝国主义的反华宣传运动。
