Xinhua News Agency, Changsha dispatch: Staff and workers of the Matian Coal Mine in Hunan Province recently constructed a large self-flowing coal screening sieve made of bamboo and wood. This coal sieve is located next to the coal unloading trestle. Coal trucks unload coal from the trestle above, which then passes through the sieve. Lump coal with a diameter of over thirty millimeters can automatically slide to the ground in front of the sieve, while fine coal falls to the area below the sieve.

    自溜选煤筛
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省马田煤矿职工，最近用竹木建成了一台大型自溜选煤筛。这台煤筛设在卸煤栈桥边上。煤车从栈桥上面把煤卸下来通过它，直径三十毫米以上的块煤就可以自动溜到筛子前面的地面上，末煤落到筛子下面去。
