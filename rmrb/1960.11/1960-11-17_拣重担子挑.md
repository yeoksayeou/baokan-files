	Choose the Heavy Burden to Carry
	Cheng Pu
	In revolution and construction, daring to choose heavy burdens to carry, daring to meet difficulties and overcome them, is the great spirit that communists should possess.
	"What is work? Work is struggle." "We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we must go, that is what makes a good comrade." Chairman Mao educates us with this spirit. He called on party cadres to learn from the communist spirit of those comrades who "give enjoyment to others, choose the heavy burdens to carry, endure hardship before others, and enjoy after others."
	In socialist construction, just like in the revolutionary war period, there are thousands upon thousands of good comrades in our cadre ranks who are not afraid of difficulties, dare to shoulder heavy burdens, and work hard for the cause of communism. Comrade Li Dianzhao, who is introduced in today's newspaper, is one of the thousands of comrades who dare to shoulder heavy burdens. Since the winter of 1954, the Party has always sent him to production teams (now production brigades) with the most difficulties and backward production to be the captain. And wherever he goes, he mobilizes the masses of that team to work vigorously, practically, arduously, and cleverly. In this way, he transformed four backward teams into advanced teams, developed the production of these teams, and increased the income of the members.
	How did Comrade Li Dianzhao manage to successfully carry one heavy burden after another? Does he have any extraordinary intelligence or a set of production experiences superior to others? Neither. His most important experience is quite ordinary: it is to resolutely believe in the masses and consult with them in everything. Whenever he goes to a backward team, he is never intimidated by the various difficulties, and he does not look down on the masses because of some temporary backward phenomena among them. He is so careful to discover positive factors, draw wisdom and strength from the masses, grasp the key to increasing production, and organize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, so that every team can become a high-yielding team in the same year.

    拣重担子挑
    程浦
    在革命中和建设中，敢于拣重担子挑，敢于迎接困难，战而胜之，这是共产主义者应有的伟大气魄。
    “什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席就是以这种精神教育我们的。他号召党的干部学习那些“享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头”的同志们的共产主义精神。
    在社会主义建设中像在革命战争时期一样，在我们的干部队伍中有着成千上万的不怕困难、敢挑重担子、为共产主义事业艰苦奋斗的好同志。今天本报介绍的李殿照同志就是千万个敢挑重担子的同志中的一个。从1954年冬季以来，党总是派他到困难最多、生产落后的生产队（现在是生产小队）去当队长，而他到了哪个队，就把哪个队的群众发动起来，猛干实干苦干巧干。这样他把四个落后队变成了先进队，使这些队的生产发展了，社员收入增加了。
    李殿照同志能够把一个又一个的重担子胜利地挑了起来，这力量是从何而来的呢？难道他有什么超凡的聪明，有一套比别人高明的生产经验？都不是。他的最主要的经验说来很平凡：就是坚决相信群众，事事同群众商量。每当他到一个落后队里的时候，他从来没有被各种各样的困难吓住，没有看到群众中的某些暂时的落后现象而看不起群众，他是那样细心地去发现积极因素，从群众中汲取智慧和力量，抓住了增产关键，把群众的积极性、创造性组织起来，因而就能使得每一个队都在当年变成了高产的队。
