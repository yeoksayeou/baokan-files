Xinhua News Agency, Havana, October 28th: People from all walks of life in Cuba held various activities throughout the country today to commemorate the first anniversary of the disappearance of former rebel army leader Camilo Cienfuegos.

Cienfuegos was one of the most beloved leaders of the Cuban Revolution and came from a working-class background. He died last year on this day during a flight from Camagüey to Havana after pacifying the counter-revolutionary rebellion led by Hubert Matos, instigated by U.S. imperialism.

From early morning until late at night, thousands of workers, staff, students, housewives, elderly people, teachers, and militia members in the capital Havana carried national flags to the seawall.

President Dorticós, government ministers, and the diplomatic corps also sailed on yachts near the Morro Castle and cast flowers into the sea. Throughout Havana and other cities in Cuba, many windows displayed national flags in mourning. Today's editorial in "Hoy" called on the Cuban people to "struggle like Camilo, unite even more closely, increase production, strengthen defense, raise awareness, and oppose the savage economic attacks that the mad U.S. imperialists and their bought-and-paid-for spokesmen are carrying out against us today, as well as the sinister threats of aggression using hired adventurers and traitors."

    古巴人民追念前起义军领导人
    “今日报”号召学习卡米洛对敌斗争的榜样
    据新华社哈瓦那28日电　古巴各阶层人民今天在全国举行了各种活动，追念前起义军领导人卡米洛·西恩富戈斯失踪一周年。
    西恩富戈斯是古巴革命中最受人民爱戴的领袖之一，工人出身。他是去年今天在平息了由美帝国主义唆使的以乌维尔特·马托斯为首的卖国叛乱集团之后由卡马圭到哈瓦那的飞行途中牺牲的。
    从清晨直到深夜，首都哈瓦那数以千计的工人、职员、学生、家庭主妇、老年人、教师和民兵携带着国旗走向堤岸。
    多尔蒂科斯总统、政府各部部长和外交使团也在莫罗要塞附近乘着游艇向大海投下了鲜花。在整个哈瓦那和古巴其他城市，许多窗口悬挂起致哀的国旗。“今日报”今天发表的社论号召古巴人民“像卡米洛一样地斗争，更加团结一致，提高生产，加强防卫，提高觉悟，反对疯狂的美帝国主义者及其收买的代言人今天对我们进行的野蛮的经济攻击以及利用雇佣的冒险分子和叛徒进行的罪恶的侵略威胁。”
