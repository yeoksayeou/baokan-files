Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 5th: According to Soviet press materials, the total electricity production in the Soviet Union in 1959 had increased 138 times compared to 1913 before the October Revolution; electricity production per capita increased eighty times compared to before the October Revolution. Now, the power generation capacity of the Lenin Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River alone is more than double the total national power generation capacity of Tsarist Russia in 1913 (1.1 million kilowatts).

In the past few decades, the Soviet electric power industry has developed at a rapid pace. In recent years, the average power generation capacity of power stations completed and put into production annually in the Soviet Union has been 5 million kilowatts; and now, this indicator has increased to approximately 6 million kilowatts. This year, the Soviet Union is constructing a total of forty large-scale thermal power plants and twenty-five hydroelectric power plants. Among them, some power stations have been completed and put into production. Between 1921 and 1935, the Soviet Union's power generation capacity increased almost six-fold, and electricity production increased forty-fold. From 1936 to 1958, the Soviet Union built a large number of power stations. Although German fascist invaders destroyed more than sixty large-scale power stations in the Soviet Union during the Great Patriotic War, the total power generation capacity of the Soviet Union still increased by 46 million kilowatts during these twenty-three years, enabling Soviet electricity production to jump from eighth place in the world during Tsarist Russia to second place in the world and first place in Europe.

During the Seven-Year Plan period (1959-1965), the Soviet Union will continue to build a series of power stations, including many large-scale power stations. The electricity produced by the Soviet Union in seven years will increase by 280 billion kilowatt-hours; the power generation capacity put into production will be equal to the total power generation capacity of the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany put into production up to now. During this period, the construction speed of Soviet power stations will be further accelerated.

The accelerated development of the Soviet electric power industry will mainly be achieved through prioritizing the construction of thermal power plants, while simultaneously constructing hydroelectric power stations with strong power generation capacity, and shortening the construction period of power stations as much as possible. Due to the continuous increase in the labor productivity of construction workers, the construction period of Soviet power stations has been greatly shortened. During the period from 1951 to 1958, the labor productivity of Soviet power station construction workers doubled; the Kremenchug Hydroelectric Station with a power generation capacity of 625,000 kilowatts was recently fully completed and put into production in only three years.

While building thermal power plants and hydroelectric power stations, the Soviet Union is also successfully building atomic energy power stations. The world's first atomic energy power station in the Soviet Union began supplying electricity in 1954. The power generation capacity of this power station is 5,000 kilowatts. In the future, the Soviet Union will build atomic energy power stations with a power generation capacity of more than 400,000 kilowatts.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: Melnik, Director of the Technical Bureau of the State Chemical Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers, told this reporter that in recent years, the chemical industry, as one of the key industrial sectors developed by the Soviet Union, has achieved rapid development. In 1959, the total output value of chemical industrial products (including rubber and asbestos) had increased 150 times compared to 1913 before the October Revolution. In the past year and the first half of this year, a total of seventy-six chemical industrial enterprises and workshops have been built throughout the country.

He also said that the Soviet chemical industry has made significant achievements in the manufacture of new products and technological progress. The geographical distribution of the chemical industry is also undergoing tremendous changes.

Melnik said that the Soviet Union has left all capitalist countries far behind in terms of the development speed of the chemical industry. Compared with 1937, Soviet chemical industrial production increased 9.6 times in 1959, while in the same period, the United States only increased 3.8 times, the United Kingdom - 1.9 times, France - 2.5 times, and West Germany - 2.3 times. This year, the Soviet chemical industry continues to develop at a higher speed, and the output value of some important products will have a great increase. For example, compared with 1958, the year before the start of the Seven-Year Plan, the production of plastics and synthetic resins will increase by 50%, chemical fibers will increase by 40%, synthetic rubber will increase by 30%, and synthetic ethanol will increase by about two times.

He pointed out that in recent years, the Soviet Union has carried out large-scale capital construction in the chemical industry. In 1960, Soviet investment in new construction and expansion of chemical industrial enterprises increased by 2.4 times compared to 1957, and the total amount of construction projects carried out in this year alone is equal to the total amount of construction projects completed in the four years before the start of the Seven-Year Plan. According to the plan, investment in chemical industrial capital construction in 1961 will increase by 40% compared to 1960.

Melnik said that in the past two years, the Soviet Union has widely implemented measures to improve process regulations and develop technological progress in the chemical industry. Due to the progress of science and technology, the raw material structure of the chemical industry has undergone significant changes. Inexpensive petroleum gas and natural gas occupy a certain position in chemical raw materials, which has produced enormous technical and economic effects on the national economy. For example, the Soviet Union used to produce ethanol entirely from grains and potatoes, but now some large factories have used petroleum gas to produce synthetic ethanol. With the improvement of production automation, the workshops of some large factories producing synthetic rubber, ammonia, and alcohol now use automatic instruments to control the production process, and the production of a factory or workshop only requires two to four workers to manage it.

Speaking of the changes in the geographical distribution of the chemical industry, Melnik said that before the October Revolution, Kazakhstan and the Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan had no chemical industry at all. By 1958, the total output value of the chemical industry in the Central Asian republics accounted for 3% of the total output value of the chemical industry in the Soviet Union. Now, the number of employees in the chemical industry in these regions has increased seventy-one times compared to 1926. And by 1965, their total chemical industrial output value will increase by 5.2 times compared to 1958.

Melnik finally said that the Soviet Union has exceptionally rich natural resources such as oil, coal, natural gas, wood, and salt, which provides the possibility for accelerating the development of the chemical industry in the future. Now, the Soviet Union is formulating a twenty-year general perspective plan for the development of the chemical industry starting from 1960, according to which a series of new chemical industrial sectors will be established.

    苏联电力和化学工业飞速发展
    发电量和化学工业产值都比十月革命前增加一百几十倍
    新华社莫斯科5日电　根据苏联报刊材料，苏联1959年电力总产量已经增加为十月革命前1913年的一百三十八倍；按人口平均计算的电力产量，比十月革命前提高了八十倍。现在，单是伏尔加河上的一座列宁水电站的发电能力，就比沙皇俄国1913年全国总发电能力（一百一十万瓩）多一倍。
    在过去几十年中，苏联电力工业以很快的速度发展。近几年来，苏联每年建成和投入生产的电力站的发电能力平均为五百万瓩；而现在，这一指标则已经提高到大约六百万瓩。今年，苏联总共建设四十座大型火电站和二十五座水电站。其中，已有一些电力站建成，并投入了生产。在1921年到1935年间，苏联的发电能力提高了几乎六倍，发电量增加了四十倍。从1936年到1958年，苏联建设了大批的电力站，尽管在卫国战争期间德国法西斯侵略者曾经破坏了苏联的六十多座大型发电站，但是，苏联的全部发电能力在这二十三年间仍然增加了四千六百万瓩，从而使苏联的电力生产从沙皇俄国时占世界第八位而跃居世界第二位，居欧洲第一位。
    七年计划期间（1959—1965年），苏联将继续建设一系列发电站，其中包括许多大型的发电站。苏联七年中所生产的电力将增加二千八百亿度；投入生产的发电能力将等于英国、法国和西德直到现在为止投入生产的发电能力的总和。在这期间，苏联电力站的建设速度将进一步加快。
    苏联电力工业的加快发展，主要将通过优先建设火力发电站，同时建设发电能力强大的水力发电站，以及尽可能缩短电站建设期限的途径来实现。由于建筑工人的劳动生产率的不断提高，苏联电站的建设期限已大大缩短了。在1951—1958年期间，苏联电站建设工人的劳动生产率提高了一倍；发电能力达六十二万五千瓩的克列门楚格水电站，只用三年就在最近全部建成并投入了生产。
    在建设火电站和水电站的同时，苏联还在成功地建设原子能发电站。苏联的世界第一个原子能发电站在1954年开始供应电力。这个电力站的发电能力为五千瓩。今后，苏联将建成发电能力在四十万瓩以上的原子能发电站。
    据新华社莫斯科电　苏联部长会议国家化学委员会技术局局长梅尔尼克对本社记者说，近年来，作为苏联重点发展的工业部门之一的化学工业获得了飞快的发展。1959年化学工业产品（包括橡胶、石棉在内）的总产值已经增加为十月革命前1913年的一百五十倍。在去年一年和今年上半年，全国共建成了七十六个化学工业企业和车间。
    他又说，在制造新产品以及技术进步等方面，苏联化学工业都取得了显著的成就。化学工业的地理分布状况也在发生着巨大的变化。
    梅尔尼克说，苏联在化学工业的发展速度方面已经把所有资本主义国家远远地抛在后面。同1937年相比，1959年苏联化学工业生产增长了九点六倍，而在同时期美国，只增长三点八倍，英国——一点九倍，法国——二点五倍，西德——二点三倍。今年，苏联化学工业继续以更高的速度发展，一些重要的产品的产值将有极大的增长。例如，同七年计划开始前的一年——1958年比较，塑料和合成树脂的生产将增长50％，化学纤维将增长40％，合成橡胶将增长30％，合成乙醇大约将增长两倍。
    他指出，近年来苏联在化学工业方面进行了大规模的基本建设。1960年苏联用于新建和扩建化学工业企业的投资比1957年增加了二点四倍，单是今年一年进行的建设工程总量就等于七年计划开始以前的四年中所完成的建设工程量的总和。根据计划，1961年化学工业基本建设的投资又将比1960年增加40％。
    梅尔尼克说，近两年来，苏联在化学工业中广泛地实行了改进工艺规程和发展技术进步的措施。由于科学技术的进步，化学工业的原料结构发生了显著的变化。廉价的石油气和天然气在化学原料中占了一定的地位，这对国民经济产生了巨大的技术和经济效果。例如，苏联过去完全用谷物和马铃薯生产乙醇，而现在一些大型工厂已经用石油气来生产合成乙醇了。随着生产自动化水平的提高，目前一些生产合成橡胶、氨、酒精的大型工厂的车间，都用自动仪器操纵生产过程，一个工厂或车间的生产只用两名到四名工人来管理就可以了。
    在谈到化学工业地理分布状况发生的变化时，梅尔尼克说，在十月革命前，哈萨克以及乌兹别克、吉尔吉斯、土库曼、塔吉克这些中亚细亚共和国根本没有化学工业。到1958年，中亚细亚各共和国的化学工业总产值，在全苏化学工业总产值中所占的比重达到了3％。现在，这些地区的化学工业的职工人数已经比1926年增加了七十一倍。而到1965年，它们的化学工业总产值还将比1958年增长五点二倍。
    梅尔尼克最后说，苏联拥有异常丰富的石油、煤、天然气、木材、盐等天然资源，这为在未来加速化学工业的发展提供了可能。现在，苏联正在制定从1960年开始的为期二十年的发展化学工业的总远景计划，根据这一计划将建立一系列新的化学工业部门。
