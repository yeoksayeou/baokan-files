    New Stoves That Can Burn Thatch
    The public canteen of the Li Huisi Production Team in Daokou Commune, Ningjin County, Hebei Province, originally had eight stoves, all of which could only burn coal and not thatch. In order to save coal, Qiu Zhigui, the secretary of the production team's party branch, and Chen Zhiwen, the canteen's administrator, jointly studied and improved the stoves. They visited the county town to learn from advanced experiences such as steam stoves and wooden cylinder pot connections, repeatedly studied and concentrated on the advantages of various stove types, and used old wooden cabinets to transform them into steam boxes, replacing cement with white mud, and successfully rebuilt stoves that could burn both coal and thatch. This type of stove can accommodate three pots in a row, making it very convenient to use. In the past, the canteen used to burn more than 1,600 jin of coal a day to cook, but now 450 jin of thatch is enough. In this way, the stalks and thatch roots allocated by the commune to the canteen for burning will be enough for eight and a half months. This will not only save a lot of coal, but also free up the eight laborers who transport coal year-round to participate in agricultural production.

    能烧茅柴的新炉灶
    河北宁津县道口公社李会寺生产队的公共食堂原有八个炉灶，都只能烧煤、不能烧茅柴。为了节约煤炭，生产队党支部书记丘之贵就和食堂事务长陈志文等共同研究，改良炉灶。他们到县城里参观学习了蒸气灶和木筒接锅等先进经验，反复研究和集中了各种灶型的优点，就用旧木柜改成蒸气箱，用白泥代替水泥，改建成功了能烧煤炭又能烧茅柴的炉灶。这种炉灶可以一连安三口锅，使用非常方便。过去食堂做饭一天要烧煤一千六百多斤，现在有四百五十斤茅柴就够了，这样一来公社分配给食堂做烧柴用的秸秆根茬和茅柴，足够烧八个半月，不仅能节约大量的煤炭，还可腾出常年运煤的八个劳动力参加农业生产。
