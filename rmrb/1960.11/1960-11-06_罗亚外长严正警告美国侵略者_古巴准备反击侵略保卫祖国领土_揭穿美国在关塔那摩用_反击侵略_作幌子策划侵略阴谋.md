Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 4th (TASS): Cuban Foreign Minister Roa issued a statement to the press yesterday regarding the US aggression plans against Cuba.

The statement pointed out that US President Eisenhower's recent statement regarding the US government's attitude toward the Guantanamo Naval Base is a clear threat of armed intervention against Cuba. The statement said that it is not the first time that high-ranking US officials have spoken in this or similar ways to my country after the overthrow of the Batista tyranny, but the difference this time is that this threat is in the process of being carried out.

It is particularly noteworthy that, just as preparations are being intensified for a large-scale offensive against Cuba from US territory, from Guatemala, and from the Swan Islands, President Eisenhower has made a statement regarding “the significance of the Guantanamo base for the defense of the Western Hemisphere (especially in light of the existing relations between the current Cuban government and the Sino-Soviet bloc)."

The statement pointed out that Eisenhower's statement that the US garrison in Guantanamo and the use of this base would not pose a threat to Cuba's sovereignty or the peace and security of its residents is purely a smokescreen, the purpose of which is to cover up the malicious conspiracy in his speech.

In this regard, it is sufficient to talk about the history of US and Latin American relations. The government of this country's so-called respect for the sovereignty, peace, and security of the people of Latin American countries depends on the extent to which the governments of these countries politically, economically, diplomatically, and militarily submit to the interests of this powerful imperial structure. Peoples who hope to get rid of this subordination or are in the stage of liberation have long known that their sovereignty, peace, and security are likely to be persecuted, suppressed, aggressed, subverted, and interfered with by the US government. If the government of any country dares to establish normal diplomatic and trade relations with socialist countries, then in this case, overthrowing it is considered legitimate, although this means a brutal violation and trampling of international law.

The statement said that the current situation in Cuba is exactly like this. The US government has taken various forms of suppression, intimidation, and aggression against the Cuban revolutionary government and people; however, because we cannot be subdued, it has now resorted to the clumsy excuse that Cuba has become a satellite of the Soviet Union and China to justify its aggression against Cuban territory and the restoration of political and economic rule in Cuba.

The statement pointed out that at the United Nations General Assembly, the Cuban delegation reiterated the revolutionary government's attitude towards the Guantanamo base, which has been firmly pointed out by Cuban Prime Minister Castro in the general debate of the UN General Assembly and earlier by some Cuban leaders on many occasions. Cuban President Dorticós also reiterated this position in response to Eisenhower's statement, that is: the revolutionary government has never intended to use force to restore the inalienable right of the Cuban people to fully legally and sovereignly exercise control over this vital location on the national territory. The US government hopes to do this; but it must be understood that no one intends to do such a stupid thing. It would indeed be stupid if the Cuban revolutionary government and people deliberately catered to the wishes of the US government.

The statement emphasized: In view of the fact that various representatives of the US government have been conducting a suspicious campaign for months regarding the issue of a hypothetical attack on the Guantanamo base, the revolutionary government has taken the most stringent measures to eliminate any excuse for provocateurs. What is being premeditated is undoubtedly this: to create objective and psychological conditions for a staged self-aggression, which, combined with invading troops and a puppet exile provisional government, leads to armed intervention and occupation of Cuba under the fabricated guise of safeguarding the Western Hemisphere from the threat of Soviet and Chinese infiltration.

This plan will have different options, because it has been widely publicized by US presidential candidates, especially the US ambassador to Mexico, and some of the actions taken have been blamed on the Cuban revolutionary government. In order to ensure the election of Vice President Nixon, an American imperialist "glorious victory" in Cuba is needed, and this victory will be shamelessly regarded by the two candidates as some kind of "capital." Therefore, it is logical to speculate that this staged self-aggression will be attempted before November 8. The strange weekend leave of US Marines at the Guantanamo base, the announcement of laying mines around the base to prevent an inevitable attack, and the announcement of exercises on the theme of repelling an unwarranted aggression are all signs of planning a staged self-aggression. Newspapers, radio stations, and television have prepared most of the American public opinion to welcome the appalling crime that is about to be implemented terribly irresponsibly and hysterically. We once again expose this crime to the world.

The statement concluded: But we want to make the following warning: The Cuban revolutionary government and people are prepared to repel aggression and retake every inch of national territory from the aggressors. We also declare that in this Second War of Independence, the Cuban revolutionary government and people will not be isolated. The cause of Cuba is the cause of the people of all underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, and the security and peace of the whole world depends on its fate.

### 罗亚外长严正警告美国侵略者  古巴准备反击侵略保卫祖国领土  揭穿美国在关塔那摩用“反击侵略”作幌子策划侵略阴谋

    罗亚外长严正警告美国侵略者
    古巴准备反击侵略保卫祖国领土
    揭穿美国在关塔那摩用“反击侵略”作幌子策划侵略阴谋
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社纽约4日讯：古巴外交部长罗亚昨天就美国对古巴的侵略计划向报界发表了声明。
    声明指出，美国总统艾森豪威尔最近关于美国政府对关塔那摩海军基地的态度的声明，是美国对古巴进行武装干涉的明显的威胁。声明说，在巴蒂斯塔暴政被推翻后，美国高级官方人士对我的国家讲这种的或类似的话已经不是第一次了，但是这一次的区别就在于，这种威胁正处在执行的过程中。
    十分值得注意的是，正当加紧准备从美国领土，从危地马拉和西斯内群岛广泛进攻古巴的时候，艾森豪威尔总统发表了关于“关塔那摩基地对西半球的防御的意义（特别是从目前的古巴政府和中苏集团之间现有的关系来看）”的声明。
    声明指出，艾森豪威尔声明中所谓美国在关塔那摩的驻军和对这个基地的利用不会对古巴的主权和它的居民的和平和安全构成威胁的话，纯粹是一种烟幕，其目的是要掩盖他的讲话中的恶毒阴谋。
    在这方面，只要谈一谈美国和拉丁美洲的关系史就足够了。这个国家的政府对拉丁美洲各国人民的主权、和平和安全的所谓尊重是取决于这些国家的政府在政治、经济、外交和军事上屈服这个强大的帝国结构利益的程度的。希望摆脱这种从属地位或正处在解放阶段的人民老早就知道，他们的主权、和平和安全很可能遭到美国政府的迫害、压制、侵略、颠复和干涉。如果有哪个国家的政府敢于同社会主义国家建立正常的外交和贸易关系，那么在这种情况下，推翻它被认为是合法的事，虽然，这意味着对国际法的粗暴破坏和蹂躏。
    声明说，古巴目前的情况也正是如此。美国政府对古巴革命政府和人民采取了种种形式的压制、恫吓和侵略手段；但是，由于我们是制服不了的，现在又使出了所谓古巴已变成苏中的卫星国这样一个拙劣的借口，来为它对古巴领土的侵略和在古巴恢复政治和经济统治进行辩解。
    声明指出，在联合国大会上，古巴代表团重申了革命政府对关塔那摩基地的态度，这已经在古巴总理卡斯特罗在联大一般性辩论中以及早些时候某些古巴领导人在许多场合下坚决地指出过。古巴总统多尔蒂科斯也在回答艾森豪威尔的声明时重申了这种立场，即：革命政府过去和现在始终不打算使用武力来恢复古巴人民实现对国家领土上的这个要害地点的充分的法律和主权的不可剥夺的权利。美国政府是希望这样做的；但是必须明白，谁也不打算做这种蠢事，如果古巴革命政府和人民故意去迎合美国政府的愿望，那确实是做了蠢事。
    声明着重说：鉴于美国政府的各式各样代表人物几月来在进行着一个关于假设的进攻关塔那摩基地问题的令人可疑的运动，革命政府采取了最严厉的措施，来消除挑衅者的任何借口。预谋着的东西是毫无疑问的，这就是：为一场扮演的自我侵略创造客观的和心理的条件，这种自我侵略同入侵的部队和徒有其名的流亡临时政府结合在一起，在臆造的保障西半球安全不受中苏渗透威胁的幌子下，导致武装干涉和占领古巴。
    这个计划会有不同的方案，因为它已被美国总统候选人，特别是美国驻墨西哥大使大肆宣扬了，已经暴露了，而所做的某些行动却被归罪于古巴革命政府。为了使副总统尼克松的当选，需要一个美国帝国主义在古巴的“光辉胜利”，这种胜利将被两名候选人厚颜无耻地当成某种
  “本钱”，因此推测在11月8日前尝试这种扮演的自我侵略是合乎逻辑的。美国海军陆战队士兵奇怪地在关塔那摩基地上度过星期六和星期日的休假，宣布在这个基地周围敷设地雷，以防必然的进攻，宣布以反击莫须有的侵略为课题的演习，这就是策划扮演的自我侵略的迹象。报纸、电台和电视已使大部分的美国舆论准备好，以便可怕地不负责任地以及歇斯底里地欢迎准备实施的骇人听闻的罪行，这种罪行我们再次向全世界揭露。
    声明最后说：但是我们要作如下警告：古巴革命政府和人民准备反击侵略，夺回侵略者手中的每块祖国领土。我们并且宣布，在这一场第二次独立战争中，古巴革命政府和人民将不是孤立的。古巴的事业是拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲所有不发达国家人民的事业，全世界安全和和平取决于它的命运。
