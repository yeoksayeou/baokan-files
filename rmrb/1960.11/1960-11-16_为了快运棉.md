    In the Acquisition Season

    To Expedite Cotton Transport
    One day, Wang Xingsheng, the director of the Commercial Section of our commune, received a call from the director of the Gangcheng Cotton Processing Factory in the county, hoping to find a way to quickly transport the acquired cotton to the factory.
    When Wang Xingsheng discussed this with the members of the Party branch of the commune store, some thought that they should immediately ask the commune Party committee to send a vehicle to deliver the cotton. Others said, "We are now in the midst of a concentrated effort to rush planting, so we should find a way to quickly send the cotton while also saving labor and animal power for the commune." Finally, it was decided that the store would deliver the cotton themselves. All employees organized into three teams: one team to deliver cotton, one team to work in the store, and one team to help commune members plant wheat. The comrades who delivered the cotton immediately began to prepare transportation tools and packaging supplies. In one night, they packed 384 bags of cotton.
    The next day, before dawn, the store's cotton delivery team's handcarts, rubber-wheeled carts, and bicycles formed a long line, heading towards the Gangcheng Cotton Processing Factory amidst laughter and chatter.

    为了快运棉
    我们公社的商业科主任王兴生有一天接到县里钢城棉花加工厂厂长的电话，希望设法快把收购起的棉花运进厂去。
    王兴生同公社商店党支部的委员们一说，有的人认为，应该马上请示公社党委派车送棉花。有的说：“现在正在突击抢种，我们应该设法既把棉花快送去，又为公社节省劳力、畜力。”最后决定商店自己动手送棉花。全体职工组织了三个队：一队送棉花，一队在门市部营业，一队帮助社员种麦子。送棉花的同志立即分头准备运输工具和包装用品。一夜之间就装了三百八十四袋棉花。
    第二天天还不亮，商店送棉队的手推车、胶皮车、自行车，就排成一长列，在谈笑声中奔向钢城棉花加工厂。
