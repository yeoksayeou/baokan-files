    Quick Loading and Unloading, Wholeheartedly Serving Production
    Hengyang Shipping Company's Loading and Unloading Tenth Team Proactively Cooperates with Factories and Mines, Exceeding Production Targets Every Month for Seven Years
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) According to a report in the New Hunan Daily: The Loading and Unloading Tenth Team of Hengyang Shipping Company has been performing quick loading and unloading duties day after day for seven years, exceeding the set targets every year and every month. This year, the number of loading and unloading personnel in the team has been reduced from twenty-nine last year to fifteen, but they still exceed the set targets every day and every shift.
    The characteristic of this team is that it considers loading and unloading from the standpoint of production. In addition to establishing a system of contacting fixed factories and mines three times a day and meeting once every three days, the team also regularly sends people to the factories and mines to understand the production needs for loading and unloading. In April of this year, team member Liu Fa-ying went deep into the Hengyang Chemical Factory and found that the factory's phosphate rock powder warehouse was more than four hundred meters away from the production workshop, which not only made production inconvenient but also increased the number of internal transport workers in the factory. He suggested to the factory that a shed should be built next to the production workshop, and that the loading and unloading workers should directly unload the phosphate rock powder into the shed. As a result, the factory saved twelve transport workers. The South District Mechanical Rope Factory purchased sixty tons of jute from outside, and the shipping port stipulated that it should be offloaded at the Shuikouzi Wharf; however, after going ashore, it would have to be transported along the riverside street for one and a half miles, requiring an additional transfer procedure, increasing transportation costs, increasing the burden of handling, and delaying entry into the factory by three days. After learning about this situation, the team sent team members Liu Heng-zhu and two others to support the boat to the wharf at the factory gate for offloading, which facilitated production. Because they care about production, the production departments also regularly inform them of the material usage situation, providing all conveniences, which further promotes the improvement of loading and unloading efficiency.
    The team's operating area is the main grain and steel throughput wharf in Hengyang Port. The loading and unloading of goods is unbalanced, with unloading accounting for more than 80% of the total loading and unloading volume; there is a wide range of cooperation and many relationships. Industrial and agricultural raw materials and products transported from the Jiahe, Leihe, and Caohe river basins are concentrated here. Whenever the spring rain and flood season arrives, the materials entering the port from downstream come in torrents and in large batches; especially since the Great Leap Forward, the raw materials and materials needed by factories and enterprises along the river have been numerous and urgent. At one time, because we did not fully understand these characteristics, we had to ask the mobile team for help in emergencies; sometimes, due to poor planning, it caused wasted man-hours. Later, the team sent out liaison officers to conduct in-depth investigations into ships, wharves, and warehouses, starting from understanding the laws of shipping material flow, changing from passive to active, and accumulating a set of loading and unloading work methods that adapt to the laws of material flow. That is: Whenever a consignment note is received, a "scout" is immediately dispatched to actively understand the type and nature of the goods, survey the route, and the storage site, so as to know the enemy and know yourself, and win every battle, so that loading is fast and unloading is fast. Taking advantage of the gaps, everyone takes the initiative to count, add, and repair loading and unloading machinery, so as to make the troops strong and strong, and win the battle as soon as they set out. When the weather suddenly changes, concentrate manpower and machinery to rush to load and unload those flat-bottomed boats that cannot withstand the wind and waves to protect the safety of the boats. Under normal circumstances, load and unload in the order of ships and row-position sequence to facilitate operation. One day in April, seven flat-bottomed boats came from Changning, loaded over their capacity, and the grain was piled too high. The waves stirred by the sixth-level wind threatened to sink the boats. Team leader Yao Pei-lan immediately mobilized the team members to stop loading and unloading other materials, jumped into the water to rescue with the crew, and unloaded more than two hundred tons of grain in five hours.
    The old loading and unloading workers of the Tenth Team are classified as a Class C labor force operation team; however, at the same distance and loading and unloading the same goods, their monthly loading and unloading volume is 15%-20% higher than that of the Class B labor force team, and 4%-6% higher than that of the Class A labor force team. What is the reason? It is because technological innovation is well done, and mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading by combining indigenous and foreign methods have been realized. The first is to innovate the tools for loading and unloading rice, which accounts for the largest loading and unloading volume. A bamboo and wood roller canvas conveying rice machine was erected from the river to the three-story warehouse of the rice mill, so that the rice could be directly transferred to each warehouse, and the factory saved personnel for transferring and handling; at the tail of the rice machine, a concave bucket was made of old materials and installed on an old wooden boat, aligned with the cargo hold, and the bucket mouth went directly into the cargo hold. At the same time, the rice machine was lengthened and changed from a fixed type to a bamboo-section-type living dragon tail and bucket connected. In this way, the machinery was completely integrated and could adapt to the characteristics of rising and falling water, which greatly accelerated the unloading speed.
    The workers of this team have a high level of political awareness and are full of energy. In the past seven years, six comrades have joined the Party, three have been promoted to serve as branch secretaries and directors, and eleven have been rated as advanced producers. They unanimously stated that they want to raise the red flag of quick loading and unloading higher and higher, and let it fly forever on the bank of the Xiangjiang River! (Attached photo)

    快装快卸　全心全意为生产服务
    衡阳航运公司装卸十分队主动和厂矿协作七年来月月超产
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：衡阳航运公司装卸十分队七年如一日地快装快卸，年年、月月超额完成装卸任务。今年来，这个队装卸人员由去年的二十九人减为十五人，仍然天天超额，班班超产。
    这个队的特点是处处立足于生产来考虑装卸。队里除与固定的厂矿装卸单位建立一天三次联系、三天一碰头的制度外，还经常派人深入厂矿，了解生产对装卸的需要。今年4月，队员刘发英深入衡阳化工厂，发现该厂磷矿粉仓库和生产车间相距四百多米，不仅生产不便，还增加了厂内运输工人，他便向厂里建议，在生产车间旁边搭座雨棚，由装卸工人直接把磷矿粉卸放在雨棚内，结果使厂里节约了十二个运输工人。南区机制绳缆厂从外面购回六十吨黄麻，航运港规定在水口子码头起坡；可是，上岸后还要沿河街搬运一里半，要多办一次运转手续，增加运费，加重搬运负担，且要推迟三天才能入厂。分队了解这一情况后，就派队员刘恒柱等三人，把船撑到厂门口的码头起坡，便利了生产。由于他们关心生产，生产部门也经常将用料情况向他们交底，提供一切便利条件，更加促进了装卸效率提高。
    这个队的作业区是衡阳港的主要粮、钢吞吐码头。货物装、卸不平衡，卸货占装卸总量80％以上；协作面广，关系多。由茭河、耒河、草河流域外运的工、农业原料和产品，大都在此集中，每当春雨洪水季节，下游进港物资，来得猛、批量多；特别是大跃进以来，沿河各工厂企业需要的原料、材料既多又急。有一个时候，由于对这些特点不太了解，一遇紧要情况，就得请机动队帮忙；有时计划不周，又造成窝工浪费。后来，队里分别派出联络员，分头深入船舶、码头、仓储进行调查，从摸清航运物资流向规律入手，变被动为主动，积累了一套适应物资流向规律的装卸工作办法。即：每当接到托运单时，立即派出“侦察员”，主动了解货物种类、性质、勘察路线，堆放场地，作到知己知彼，百战百胜，装得快，卸得快。利用空隙时间，人人动手清点、添制和维修好装卸机具，作到兵强马壮，出征即胜。当天气突然变化时，对那些经不起风浪的平板船，集中人力、机具，抢装抢卸，保护船只安全。在正常情况下，按船只先后、排艡顺序装卸，便于操作。4月的一天，常宁来了七只平板船，装载超负荷，粮食堆得太高，六级大风吹起的大浪有把船甩沉的危险，队长姚培兰立即动员队员停止其他物资装卸，跳下水去与船员一起抢救，在五个小时内，二百多吨粮食抢卸一空。
    十分队的老装卸工人按劳力分类是丙等劳力作业队，可是，在同样的距离，装卸同样的货物，他们每月的装卸量比乙等劳力队要高出15％—20％，比甲等劳力队也要高出4％—6％。是什么原因？是技术革新搞得好，实现了土洋结合的机械化和半机械化装卸。首先是革新了装卸量最大的稻谷装卸工具。从河下直达米厂的三层楼仓库，架起了一台竹木滚筒帆布输送起谷机，使稻谷起坡便直达各个仓库，并为厂里节省了转仓搬运人员；在起谷机的尾部，利用旧料制成凹斗，安装在一个旧木船上，与货舱相艡在一起，斗口直入船舱，同时，把起谷机加长，由定型固定改成竹节式的活的龙尾和戽相接。这样，使机具彻底成龙配上了套，并能适应水涨水落的特点，大大加快了卸货速度。
    这个分队的工人由于政治觉悟高，干劲足，七年来，有六个同志入了党，有三个被提拔担任支部书记、主任，有十一个人被评为先进生产者。他们一致表示：要让这面快装快卸的红旗，越举越高，永远飘扬在湘江岸上！（附图片）
