Changtu Finance and Trade Departments Create a Complete Set of Experiences to Support Agriculture
　　Both Business and Agriculture, Combining Agriculture and Commerce
　　Strengthen the work of resident team members; add commercial outlets, enrich the content of canteens and markets, and carry out sales work on the front line; improve the technical service team, providing supply, repair, and technical services to the fields; change business hours according to the agricultural season.
　　(Reported by Liaoning Daily) The finance and trade departments of Changtu County, Liaoning Province, have implemented a system of combining business and agriculture throughout the county to serve agricultural production and the lives of commune members.
　　The basic content of the system of combining business and agriculture is: First, improve the work of resident teams and widely promote the "two-eight system" working method. Within ten days, eight days are spent participating in production labor and helping production teams to study and solve problems in production, and two days are spent on the work and study of their own departments. Second, reduce and merge urban commercial outlets, further expand rural commercial outlets, establish purchasing and sales service stations in production brigades without outlets, and set up points in every canteen (食堂) on the basis of having a store (station) in every team (生产队); and further enrich the content of canteen markets. In the past, the canteen market was linked by shop (商店) and team (生产队), but now all industries of the finance and trade departments participate in the market team, not only supplying production and living goods to the canteen and purchasing agricultural and sideline waste products from the canteen market, but also sending cooking, hairdressing, photography, miscellaneous repairs and other technologies to the market, and carrying out propaganda and education around the central work of the Party. Third, organize the establishment of a technical service team to implement supply, repair, and technical services to the fields, providing whatever is needed, repairing whatever is broken, repairing it as soon as it is broken, without delaying production. Fourth, in the busy agricultural season, change the business hours of rural commercial networks and points, implement half-day business hours, and some implement three-meal business hours (that is, open for business before and after commune members eat), commune members rest, finance and trade personnel carry out business activities, commune members labor, and finance and trade personnel squeeze out time to participate in agricultural production labor.
　　Through the above measures, the circulation link and distribution work are more closely integrated with the needs of agricultural production, which is not only conducive to the participation of finance and trade work in production, organizing production, arranging consumption, and organizing the people's economic life; but also strengthens the work of the finance and trade departments themselves, fundamentally changing the face of finance and trade work. First of all, it has enabled the finance and trade departments to better play the role of the "logistics department" of production. Finance and trade work has truly achieved "logistics first, before troops and horses move", and the supply of production materials is always ahead of the agricultural season. As early as before the autumn harvest, the technical service team helped the communes conduct a comprehensive survey and repair of "three autumn" production tools. The addition of 197 commercial outlets and the promotion of canteen markets have reduced the amount of time that production teams and commune members spend running errands, and it is estimated that 220,000 working days can be freed up for agricultural production. Finance and trade workers also directly participated in labor to support agricultural production for more than 165,000 working days. Secondly, it has better played the role of the finance and trade departments as the "housekeepers" of life. Finance and trade cadres actively participate in organizing the people's economic life and promote the development of various welfare undertakings centered on the canteen. For example, focusing on arranging grain, helping the canteen to implement planned grain use and economical grain use, establishing housework, developing sideline production, innovating cooking utensils, and improving cooking skills, so that commune members can eat enough and eat well; combining production and vigorously grasping hairdressing, dismantling and sewing, kindergartens, nurseries and other service undertakings, and so on. Again, a large number of finance and trade cadres went to the front line of agricultural production, which not only effectively supported agricultural production, but also improved their own work. The relationship between the finance and trade departments and the communes and production teams, and between the finance and trade workers and the cadres and members of the communes and teams, is very close. When the communes and commune members have needs in production and life, the finance and trade departments provide full support, and the finance and trade departments also receive strong support from the communes, production teams, and commune members in completing their work tasks. According to statistics at the end of September, the total value of agricultural and sideline product purchases in the county increased by 15% compared with the same period last year, and the deposits of commune members increased by 3.6 times compared with the same period last year. In this way, finance and trade work has fundamentally changed its own work and kept up with the development of the situation in the face of a series of major changes in the production and lifestyle of the countryside.

    昌图财贸部门创造支援农业的整套经验
    亦商亦农  农商结合
    加强驻队员工作；增设商业网点，充实食堂集市内容，在第一线开展购销工作；健全技术服务队，供应、检修、技术服务到田；根据农业季节，改变营业时间。
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：辽宁省昌图县财贸部门在全县范围内实行亦商亦农、农商结合的制度，为农业生产和社员生活服务。
    亦商亦农、农商结合制度的基本内容是：第一，改进驻队工作，广泛推行“二·八制”的工作方法，在一旬之内，八天参加生产劳动和帮助生产队研究解决生产中的问题，两天搞本部门工作与学习。第二，减少和合并城镇商业网点，进一步扩大农村商业网点，在没有网点的生产大队，普遍设立购销服务站，在队队有店（站）的基础上，堂堂（食堂）设点；并进一步充实食堂集市内容。过去的食堂集市是店（商店）队（生产队）挂钩，现在是财贸部门各行各业都参加赶集队，不仅把生产、生活用品供应到食堂，从食堂集市中收购农副土废产品，还把炊事、理发、照像、杂修等技术送到集市，并围绕党的中心工作进行宣传教育。第三，组织建立技术服务队，实行供应、检修、技术服务到田，缺啥配啥，坏啥修啥，随坏随修，不误生产。第四，在农忙季节，改变农村商业网、点的营业时间，实行半日营业，有的实行三餐营业（就是在社员吃饭前后开门营业）制度，社员休息，财贸人员就开展业务活动，社员劳动，财贸人员就挤出时间参加农业生产劳动。
    通过以上措施，就使流通环节、分配工作与农业生产需要更密切地结合了起来，既有利于财贸工作参与生产，组织生产，安排消费，组织人民经济生活；也加强了财贸部门本身的工作，根本上改变了财贸工作的面貌。首先，使财贸部门更好地发挥了生产“后勤部”的作用。财贸工作真正做到了“兵马未动，粮草先行”，生产资料供应工作时时走在农业季节的前面。早在秋收之前，技术服务队就帮助各公社对“三秋”生产工具进行了全面普查和检修。增加一百九十七个商业网点和推广食堂集市后，使生产队和社员减少了大量跑街时间，估计可腾出二十二万个劳动日投入农业生产。财贸职工直接参加劳动支援农业生产的劳动日也达十六万五千多个。其次，更好地发挥了财贸部门的生活“管家人”作用。财贸干部积极参与组织人民经济生活，促进了以食堂为中心的各项福利事业的发展。例如，以安排粮食为重点，帮助食堂实行计划用粮、节约用粮，建立家务，发展副业生产，革新炊事用具，提高炊事技术，使社员吃得饱、吃得好；结合生产大抓理发、拆洗缝纫、幼儿园、托儿所等服务事业，等等。再次，大批财贸干部开赴农业生产第一线，不仅有效地支援了农业生产，也搞好了本身工作。财贸部门与公社、生产队，财贸职工与社队干部、社员的关系亲密无间。公社和社员在生产、生活上有需要时，财贸部门全力支援，财贸部门在完成工作任务中，也得到公社、生产队、社员的大力支持。到9月末统计，全县农副产品收购总值比去年同期增长了15％，公社社员存款比去年同期增长了三点六倍。这样，财贸工作就在农村的生产方式和生活方式发生一系列重大变化的情况下，根本转变了自己的工作，跟上了形势的发展。
