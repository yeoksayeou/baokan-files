    Statement by the Central Committee Cadre Council of the Japanese Communist Party on the Election Results
    Calling for Strengthening the Party's Power and Developing the Democratic United Front
    The Japanese People's Struggle Against the "Security Treaty" and for Peace, Independence, Democracy, and Neutrality is Gradually Advancing
    Although Reactionary Forces are Still Powerful, Their Foundation Has Begun to Shake; the Ikeda Cabinet Will Encounter Serious Obstacles
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 24th: The Central Committee Cadre Council of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today on the election results, calling on all party members to further strive to strengthen the party's power and strengthen the united front of democratic forces.
    The statement said that the Liberal Democratic Party's conspiracy to seize more than two-thirds of the seats in this election finally failed, and the number of votes for the Liberal Democratic Party is decreasing each time, which shows that the ruling foundation of the Liberal Democratic Party is unstable.
    The statement emphasized that the characteristic of this election is the progress made by the forces that launched a joint struggle against the "Security Treaty." Although the Japanese Communist Party launched its election campaign under extremely difficult conditions, it still gained two more seats, and the number of votes also increased by 150,000. The Socialist Party increased by 23 seats, gaining 145 seats. In contrast, the Democratic Socialist Party decreased from 40 seats to 17 seats. The disastrous defeat of the Democratic Socialist Party shows the strong criticism of this extremely anti-communist right-wing social democratic party by the Japanese democratic forces.
    The statement pointed out that although the reactionary forces in Japan are still powerful, their foundation has begun to shake. At the same time, the Japanese people's struggle against the "Security Treaty" and for peace, independence, democracy, and neutrality is gradually advancing. Therefore, the Ikeda cabinet's ambition to establish a long-term stable regime will inevitably encounter serious obstacles.
    The statement said that in order to adhere to the U.S.-Japan military alliance system and consolidate their rule, U.S. imperialism and the Ikeda cabinet will continue to use various deceptive means to launch new attacks on the people. However, this will only promote the further strengthening of the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, democracy, neutrality, and improving their living standards.
    The statement called on all party members to work hard to develop the united action of democratic forces in various struggles, especially in the struggle to abolish the "Security Treaty," and to further strengthen the united front and strengthen the party's power.
    The Japanese Communist Party's central organ, "Red Flag," also published an editorial today, emphasizing the important significance of the significant progress made by the Japanese Communist Party and democratic forces in the election, and calling on all party members to go deep into the masses, strengthen propaganda activities, and strengthen the party's unity with the masses.

    日共中央干部会就大选结果发表声明
    号召加强党的力量发展民主统一战线
    日本人民反对“安全条约”争取和平、独立、民主和中立的斗争逐步前进
    反动势力虽然仍然强大但基础已经开始动摇池田内阁必将碰到严重障碍
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天就大选结果发表声明，号召全体党员进一步为加强党的力量和加强民主力量的统一战线而奋斗。
    声明说，自由民主党企图在这次大选中攫取三分之二以上的议席的阴谋终于失败，自由民主党的得票数目一次比一次减少，这表明，自由民主党的统治基础是不稳定的。
    声明强调指出，这次大选的特点是展开反对“安全条约”共同斗争的力量取得进展。尽管日共在极为困难的条件下展开了竞选斗争，但是日共还增加了二个议席，选票也增加了十五万张。社会党增加了二十三个议席，获得一百四十五席。与此相反，民主社会党从四十席减少到十七席。民主社会党的惨败表明了日本民主力量对这个极端反共的右翼社会民主主义政党的强烈批评。
    声明指出，目前日本反动势力虽然仍然强大，但是它的基础开始动摇。与此同时，日本人民反对“安全条约”，争取和平、独立、民主和中立的斗争正在逐步前进。因此，池田内阁建立长期稳定政权的野心必将碰到严重障碍。
    声明说，美帝国主义和池田内阁为了坚持日美军事同盟体系和稳固它们的统治，今后仍会施用种种欺骗手段，对人民展开新的进攻，但是这反而只能促使日本人民为争取独立、和平、民主、中立和提高生活水平的斗争进一步加强。
    声明号召全体党员努力奋斗，在各项斗争中，尤其是在废除“安全条约”的斗争中，发展民主力量的统一行动，并进一步加强统一战线和加强党的力量。
    日共中央机关报“赤旗报”今天同时发表社论，强调指出日共和民主力量在大选中取得显著进展的重要意义，并号召全体党员深入群众，加强宣传活动，加强党同群众的团结。
