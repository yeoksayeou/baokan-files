Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, November 16th: Zhang Junxian, a cadre from Chengguan People's Commune in Zhenyuan County, Gansu Province, who was sent to a backward production team – Miaogoumen Production Team – for more than seven months, vigorously helped grassroots cadres establish clear policy viewpoints and a serious work style of resolutely implementing various policies. He also greatly improved their leadership skills and working abilities. Now, the enthusiasm of the team's members for labor has been greatly enhanced, and the overall appearance of the team's work and production has been significantly changed.

Communist Party member Zhang Junxian was transferred from the commune to Miaogoumen Production Team to settle down in March this year, serving as the deputy secretary of the production team's Party branch. On his first day in the production team, he participated in the construction of a dam, and afterwards, he was always the first to start work and did the heaviest jobs, thus quickly gaining the love and trust of the team members. In this process, based on the feedback from the masses and his own experiences, he believed that the backwardness of this team was mainly due to the lack of thoroughness and methods in the work of the cadres. He decided to first help the grassroots cadres improve their policy level, change their leadership style and working methods, and set an example himself. After discussing with the production team cadres, he decided that everyone should go to the various small teams and implement a system of assigning areas of responsibility; he himself would stay at the Duanyayao work team, which had the worst production performance. After arriving at the small team, he often carried manure, cultivated land, herded sheep, and fed livestock with the team members. During the summer harvest, he reaped two and a half mu of wheat a day, and at night, he guarded the crops with the team members, helped the small team cadres arrange work, and ate and slept with the team members. In the six months from March to September this year, in addition to work and meetings, he worked a total of one hundred and fifty-six workdays. Under his influence and constant assistance, the cadres of Miaogoumen Production Team and the various small teams quickly changed their leadership style and were able to eat, live, work, and consult with the team members. The cadres of the production team have each worked at least twenty workdays per month for more than half a year, further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

When helping the cadres of the production team and production small teams improve their leadership level, Zhang Junxian particularly emphasized the need to conscientiously study and resolutely implement the Party's various policies. On his suggestion, the production team established a system for studying policies. Three evenings a month are dedicated to studying, with the spirits of county and commune meetings conveyed on the 3rd of each month to study the Party's relevant policies, discuss methods of implementation, and arrange the work for the next three days; on the 6th, the focus is on studying the various instructions and circulars of the county and commune Party committees; and on the 10th, the experiences and lessons learned in the work are reviewed and summarized based on the policies, and the work for the next period is arranged. They have consistently adhered to this study system since August. The team's cadres not only studied various policies related to rural work but also studied more than twenty articles on improving leadership methods and leadership styles, greatly improving the policy level and leadership level of the grassroots cadres. In terms of learning methods, Zhang Junxian always paid attention to combining theory with practice, so that the grassroots cadres not only understood the policies but also knew how to apply them specifically. For example, for the "three guarantees and one reward" work, Zhang Junxian convened an on-site meeting at the Duanyayao small team to implement the "three guarantees and one reward" system, teaching the cadres by adopting a method of learning while doing, so that the "three guarantees and one reward" system was quickly implemented throughout the team.

Zhang Junxian set an example in the implementation of policies everywhere. Once, in order to convey the policies and guidelines in a timely manner, he crossed a turbulent river at night and rushed back from the commune to the Miaogoumen small team, thirty li away, and then continued to run through three small teams to convey the Party's resolutions. During the autumn sowing, the Duanyayao small team felt that there were too few people and too much work to do in time, so they planted wheat on fifty mu of river beach land without breaking up the clods of soil. After learning about this, he went to the small team to help the cadres tap labor potential and organized more than twenty semi-laborers to till the fifty mu of land finely and evenly. Through this fact, he repeatedly explained to the small team cadres that doing everything possible to plant more and better wheat was specifically implementing the Party's policy of running agriculture and grain production in a big way. This small team later completed the winter wheat sowing task with guaranteed quality and quantity. During the autumn harvest, Zhang Junxian found that the cadres of the Kangjiawan small team only cared about production and did not pay enough attention to the canteen, so he told the small team leader Liu Yongkui that the more intense the production, the more important it was to care about the lives of the masses, and specifically helped Liu Yongkui take measures to improve the food. While working with the team members, he found that the Miaogoumen small team did not strictly implement the system of assessing work and recording points, so he helped the small team leader insist on assessing work and recording it in the labor manual on the same day. As a result, the enthusiasm of the team members was greatly encouraged, and the efficiency of carrying manure in the Duanyayao small team immediately increased by more than half, which made the small team cadres feel more deeply the importance of resolutely implementing the Party's policies.

Zhang Junxian not only helped the grassroots cadres improve their policy level but also earnestly taught them working methods, helped them improve their leadership level and ability to analyze and deal with specific things, and acted as a good "advisor" for them, rather than taking over everything. The work team leader Duan Youlong had a lot of enthusiasm for his work but lacked methods. Zhang Junxian went to this team to participate in labor and found that the team's work was not arranged properly and the labor quotas were unreasonable, so he told Duan Youlong how to lead production carefully and specifically helped him arrange the work for each team member according to their specialties the night before and implement a method of assessing work face-to-face on the same day, so that the small team's production quickly changed its appearance, and Duan Youlong's leadership methods also made a lot of progress later. In the process of helping the grassroots cadres improve their leadership level, Zhang Junxian often started with key problems and weak links, and discussed and studied with the production team and small team cadres, and through the specific handling and solution of these problems, pushed the work and production forward, so that they were inspired and improved. The Miaogoumen small team has a total of four villages. In the past, the method of concentrating labor was often adopted, and climbing mountains and wading through water wasted a lot of labor. Zhang Junxian suggested and studied with the small team cadres to organize four field work groups according to the terrain. In addition to concentrated attacks on tasks with strong seasonality, activities are usually carried out in groups. As a result, less road was traveled, more work was done, and the team members were very satisfied. He paid special attention to helping the grassroots cadres save labor and helped the small team cadres summarize a lot of experience in arranging labor according to the agricultural season and the severity of the work. Therefore, the team's "three autumn" tasks were completed very well. This year, the task of sowing 2,600 mu of wheat was completed on time with guaranteed quality and quantity, the autumn harvest has been completely harvested and transported, and more than 60% of the autumn stubble land has also been plowed.

    建立制度定期进行学习　结合实际领会政策精神
    下放干部张俊宪帮助基层干部学政策
    新华社兰州16日电　甘肃省镇原县城关人民公社干部张俊宪，在下放到一个后进生产队——庙沟门生产队的七个多月中，大力帮助基层干部树立明确的政策观点和坚决贯彻各项政策的严肃作风，并且大大提高了领导水平和工作能力。现在这个生产队的社员群众劳动积极性更加高涨，全队的工作面貌和生产面貌得到显著改变。
    共产党员张俊宪今年3月从公社下放到庙沟门生产队安家落户，担任生产队的党支部副书记。他到达生产队的头一天就参加了修水坝的劳动，以后每天总是最早上工，干最重的活，因此很快就得到社员群众的爱戴和信任。在这个过程中，他根据群众的反映和自己的体会，认为这个队落后主要是由于干部工作不深入和缺少办法。他便决定首先帮助基层干部提高政策水平、改变领导作风和工作方法，并且自己作出样子来。他和生产队干部商量后，决定大家都下到各小队，实行分片包干；自己则到生产成绩最差的段崖窑作业队蹲点。他到小队后经常和社员一起担粪、耕地、放羊、喂牲口。夏收中，他一天割二亩半小麦，晚上还和社员一起看护庄稼，帮助小队干部安排活路，和社员吃、睡都在一起。今年3月到9月的六个多月里，除了工作和开会外，他一共做了一百五十六个劳动日。在他的影响和不断帮助下，庙沟门生产队和各小队的干部迅速改变了领导作风，都能和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。生产队的干部半年多来，每人每月至少做了二十个劳动日，进一步密切了干部和群众关系。
    张俊宪在帮助生产队和生产小队干部提高领导水平时，特别强调要认真学习和坚决贯彻执行党的各项政策。在他的建议下，生产队建立了学习政策的制度。每旬学习三个晚上，每月逢三传达县、社会议精神，学习党的有关政策，讨论贯彻执行的方法，安排今后三天工作；逢六重点学习县委和公社党委各项指示和通报；逢十，根据政策检查总结工作中的经验教训，安排下段工作。从8月份以来，他们一直坚持这个学习制度。全队干部不仅学习了有关农村工作的各项政策，还学了有关改进领导方法和领导作风的文章二十多篇，大大提高了基层干部的政策水平和领导水平。在学习方法上，张俊宪始终注意理论和实际结合，使基层干部既懂政策，又会具体运用。如对“三包一奖”工作，张俊宪就在段崖窑小队召开了贯彻“三包一奖”的现场会，采取边学边做的方法教会了干部，使全队的“三包一奖”很快落实。
    张俊宪在执行政策中处处以身作则。有一次他为了及时把政策方针传达下去，连夜涉过湍急的河水，从公社赶回三十里外的庙沟门小队，又继续跑遍三个小队传达党的决议。秋播时，段崖窑小队认为人少活多来不及，将五十亩河滩地的土块没有打碎就种上了小麦。他了解后就到小队帮助干部挖掘劳动潜力，组织了二十多个半劳动力，将这五十亩地整得又细又平。通过这个事实，他向小队干部反复讲解了千方百计多种、种好小麦，就是具体地执行党的大办农业、大办粮食政策的道理，这个小队后来保质保量地完成了冬小麦播种任务。在秋收中，张俊宪发现康家湾小队的干部只顾了生产，没有很好抓食堂，他就向小队长刘永奎讲了生产越是紧张越要关心群众生活的道理，并且具体帮助刘永奎采取措施改进了伙食。他在和社员一起劳动中，发现庙沟门小队没有严格实行评工记分制度，就帮助小队长坚持当天评工当天记入劳动手册，结果大大鼓舞了社员的积极性，段崖窑小队担粪的工效立即提高一倍多，小队干部从而更深刻地感到坚决贯彻党的政策的重要性。
    张俊宪不仅帮助基层干部提高政策水平，还认真地教给他们工作方法，帮助他们提高领导水平和对具体事物的分析处理能力，给他们当好
  “参谋”，而不是包办代替。作业队长段有龙工作干劲很足，就是缺少办法。张俊宪就到这个队参加劳动，发现队里活安排不当，劳动定额不合理，就告诉段有龙要怎样来细致地领导生产，并具体帮助他按每个社员的特长，在头天晚上就把活安排到人，并实行当天当面评工的办法，使小队的生产很快改变面貌，段有龙的领导方法以后也有了许多进步。张俊宪在帮助基层干部提高领导水平的过程中，多是从关键性的问题和薄弱环节入手，和生产队与小队干部一起商量研究，通过对这些问题的具体处理和解决，把工作和生产向前推进一步，从而使他们得到启发和提高。庙沟门小队共有四个村庄，原来在使用劳动力上多是采取大集中的方法，爬山涉水对劳动力浪费很大，张俊宪就提出建议和小队干部研究，按地形组织了四个田间作业组，除对季节性强的任务采取集中突击外，平时按小组活动，结果走的路少了，做的活多了，社员很满意，他特别注意帮助基层干部节约劳动力，帮助小队干部总结了不少根据农事季节和活路的轻重缓急安排劳动力的经验，因而使全队的“三秋”任务完成得很好，今年二千六百亩小麦播种任务都保质保量按时完成，秋收已全部收割拉运结束，秋茬地也翻耕了60％以上。（附图片）
