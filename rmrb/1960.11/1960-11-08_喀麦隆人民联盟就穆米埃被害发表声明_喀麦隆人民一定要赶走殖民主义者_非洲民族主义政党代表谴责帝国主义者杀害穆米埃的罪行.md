Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 7th. The Cameroon People's Union issued a statement today, strongly condemning the heinous crime of French-American imperialists in poisoning the Union's Chairman, Moumié. The statement calls on the people of Cameroon to transform their grief into strength and intensify the struggle until final victory.

	The statement, signed by Kingue and Ouandié, Deputy Vice-Presidents of the Political Bureau of the Guidance Committee of the Cameroon People's Union, and issued in Geneva, states that French imperialists, frightened by the rapid development of the Cameroon revolution, murdered the General Secretary of the Cameroon People's Union, Nyoubi, in the forests of the Sanaga Maritime region in 1958. Recently, French-American imperialists poisoned the Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, Moumié, in Geneva. This is a blow to the national cause of Cameroon, and the people of Cameroon feel deeply grieved by this. The statement points out that these crimes of the imperialists demonstrate their unscrupulousness and their evil determination to perpetually colonially exploit Cameroon and its people.

	The statement then points out that the imperialists' criminal activities are in vain. All events prove that the Cameroon revolution has not entered a low ebb; it is proceeding with such great scale and strength, both in the past and at present, that it will completely collapse the foundation of the imperialist system. The people of Cameroon know today, as they did yesterday, that they must continue to struggle until the colonialists are driven out of Cameroon. The statement calls on the people of Cameroon to take action and eliminate from Cameroon the imperialists and their allies and agents, and those who serve the French criminal organization "Red Hand," which plotted to murder the Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union.

	The statement calls on the people of Cameroon to "transform grief into strength." It says: "Moumié has gloriously sacrificed himself on the battlefield. Throughout his life, he has constantly set a shining example of dedication and bravery for you. This means that, in the current situation, in guerrilla areas, in offices, in factories, in workshops, in cities, and in villages, you should transform your grief into strength and intensify the people's struggle. Through resolute action, you must tell the imperialists and their agents that their days are numbered, and that they will soon be swept away by the storm of the Cameroon revolution."

	The statement says: The people of Cameroon will show the world that all blows have not only failed to defeat them spiritually, but have made them even stronger. Their resolute struggle for liberation for many years and the continuous sacrifices they have suffered have tempered them. They will continue the revolution with even greater anger.

	The statement concludes: "The Political Bureau of the Guidance Committee of the Cameroon People's Union solemnly declares: The revolution continues. Faithful to the struggle in which Nyoubi, Moumié, and many such patriots have sacrificed themselves, it will guide the actions of the people of Cameroon until final victory."

	The statement emphasizes: "'The barking of dogs cannot stop the great caravan.' The imperialists killed Moumié, but the revolution continues, and we will achieve victory."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 6th. Representatives of nationalist parties from several African countries in Cairo today jointly issued a press release on the death of Moumié, Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, condemning the imperialists' crime of murdering leaders of African national independence movements.

	These African nationalist parties are: the Zanzibar Nationalist Party, the South African United Front, the Kenya African National Union, the Northern Rhodesia United National Independence Party, the Southern Rhodesia National Democratic Party, and the Uganda National Congress.

	The press release said that the representatives of various African nationalist movements struggling against colonialism and imperialism "unreservedly condemn the act of French imperialists in murdering the African nationalist leader Dr. Moumié. We consider this action cowardly and immoral. We declare to the colonialists and imperialists, especially the French imperialists, that the struggle for African freedom and independence is not the matter of one person, but the expression of the will of the people. Eliminating African leaders in any way will never destroy the ability of the African people to struggle; in fact, such actions help to inspire the national liberation movement and give it momentum. The people of Cameroon, under the leadership of the Cameroon People's Union, must therefore redouble their efforts to fight for complete freedom and continue to adhere to Moumié's principles of striving for the complete liberation of Cameroon and the entire African continent."

	The press release points out that it is not only French imperialism that murdered Dr. Moumié. "This is a common conspiracy of imperialism to eliminate true African nationalist leaders. French imperialists and their accomplices must clearly see that African nationalism is already vigorous, and neither weapons nor poisoning its leaders can frighten or stop it. Our cause is simple and clear: it strives for freedom, independence, and the complete destruction of all forms of colonialism. Nothing can stop this movement."

	The press release concludes, "We pledge to continue the struggle and realize the beliefs and aspirations of our deceased comrade Moumié."

    喀麦隆人民联盟就穆米埃被害发表声明
    喀麦隆人民一定要赶走殖民主义者
    非洲民族主义政党代表谴责帝国主义者杀害穆米埃的罪行
    新华社日内瓦7日电　喀麦隆人民联盟今天发表声明，强烈谴责法—美帝国主义者毒死联盟主席穆米埃的卑鄙罪行。声明号召喀麦隆人民化悲愤为力量，加紧进行斗争，直到最后胜利。
    由喀麦隆人民联盟指导委员会政治局副主席金格和乌安迪署名在日内瓦发表的这份声明说，被喀麦隆革命迅速发展吓破了胆的法帝国主义者1958年在沙纳加海滨区的森林中杀害了喀麦隆人民联盟总书记尼奥比，最近，法—美帝国主义者又在日内瓦毒死了喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃。这是对喀麦隆民族事业的打击，喀麦隆人民对此深感沉痛。声明指出，帝国主义者的这些罪行表明他们不择手段，为永久地对喀麦隆和它的人民进行殖民剥削的罪恶决心。
    声明接着指出，帝国主义者的犯罪活动是枉费心机的。一切事件证明，喀麦隆革命没有进入低潮，它在过去和现在都以如此巨大的规模和力量进行，它将使帝国主义制度的基础完全崩溃。喀麦隆人民今天和昨天一样都知道，要继续进行斗争，一直到把殖民主义者从喀麦隆赶出去。声明号召喀麦隆人民行动起来，把帝国主义者及其同盟者和代理人、为谋害喀麦隆人民联盟主席的法国的罪恶组织“红手”效劳的人从喀麦隆清除掉。
    声明号召喀麦隆人民“化悲愤为力量”。它说：“穆米埃已在战场上光荣地牺牲。他的一生不断地给你们树立了献身和勇敢的光辉榜样。这就是说，在目前情况下在游击区，在办公室，在工厂，在工场，在城市，在乡村，你们应该把悲愤化为力量，加紧进行人民斗争。你们要通过坚决行动，告诉帝国主义者及其代理人：他们的日子屈指可数了，告诉他们，他们很快就会被喀麦隆革命的风暴刮走。”
    声明说：喀麦隆人民将向全世界表明，一切打击不但没有在精神上打倒他们，反而使他们更加坚强。他们好几年来坚决地进行解放战斗，他们不断遭到的牺牲把他们百炼成钢，他们将更为愤怒地继续革命。
    声明最后说：“喀麦隆人民联盟指导委员会政治局庄严宣布：革命在继续中。它忠实于尼奥比、穆米埃和许多这样的爱国者在其中牺牲了的斗争，将指导喀麦隆人民的行动，直到最后胜利。”
    声明强调说：“‘狗叫挡不住巨大的旅行队’。帝国主义者杀死了穆米埃，但革命在继续中，我们将获得胜利。”
    新华社开罗6日电　非洲若干国家的民族主义政党在开罗的代表今天就喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃之死联合发表新闻公报，谴责帝国主义者杀害非洲民族独立运动领袖的罪行。
    这些非洲民族主义政党是：桑给巴尔民族主义党、南非统一阵线、怯尼亚非洲民族联盟、北罗得西亚联合民族独立党、南罗得西亚民族民主党和乌干达国民大会。
    公报说，为反对殖民主义和帝国主义而斗争的非洲各民族主义运动的代表，“无保留地谴责法帝国主义者杀害非洲民族主义领袖穆米埃博士的行为。我们认为这个行动是懦怯的，不道德的。我们向殖民主义者和帝国主义者，特别是法帝国主义者宣布，争取非洲自由和独立的斗争不是一个人的事情，而是人民的意志的表现。以任何方式消灭非洲领袖决不会摧毁非洲人民斗争的能力，实际上，这种行动有助于激发民族解放运动使它获得动力。在喀麦隆人民联盟领导下的喀麦隆人民，必须因此加倍努力，为彻底的自由进行斗争，并继续坚持穆米埃争取喀麦隆和整个非洲大陆的彻底解放的原则。”
    公报指出，杀害穆米埃博士的并不单是法帝国主义。“这是帝国主义消灭真正的非洲民族主义领袖的共同的阴谋。法帝国主义分子和他们的同谋者必须清楚地看到，非洲民族主义已经生气勃勃，无论是武器还是毒害它的领袖都不能吓倒或制止它。我们的事业是简单明了的：它争取自由、独立和彻底摧毁各种形式的殖民主义。任何东西都无力制止这个运动。”
    公报最后说，“我们保证继续进行斗争，并实现我们已故的同伴穆米埃的信仰和愿望。”
