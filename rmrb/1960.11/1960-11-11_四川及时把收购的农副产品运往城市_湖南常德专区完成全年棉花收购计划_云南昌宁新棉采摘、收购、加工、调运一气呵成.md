Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 10th -- Sichuan Province is promptly transporting purchased cotton, hemp, tobacco, tea and other agricultural and sideline products to cities to support factory production. Since the new cotton came on the market, the province has been continuously transferring new cotton to Chongqing and Shanghai, while also transporting more than 140,000 dan of rosin, raw lacquer, gallnuts and other raw materials and local products for light chemical industry to many cities inside and outside the province.
	Sichuan Province’s relevant departments are all seizing the opportunity during the current agricultural and sideline product harvesting and purchasing season to do a good job in the initial processing and transportation of agricultural and sideline products, in order to supply a large amount of new raw materials to factories. The textile industry sector, in the midst of busy production, has dispatched employees to the main cotton producing areas to pick, process, and transport cotton together with commune members and commercial employees. Chongqing Yuhua, 601 and other textile factories sent more than 100 workers to communes and production teams in Jianyang County to help repair cotton ginning, power and other machinery, participate in cotton ginning, feeding, and packing, accelerating the speed of cotton transportation. Sichuan Province has a large output of cotton stalk skins. In addition to assisting communes in rationally arranging labor to peel the stalks while pulling them, the relevant departments also supplied more than 5,000 cotton stalk peeling machines, so that these cotton stalk skins could be peeled off and transported out in a timely manner.
	In order to accelerate the transportation of agricultural and sideline products, commercial departments in various places are cooperating with light industrial departments to establish joint transportation teams to strengthen leadership. The province's commercial system has dispatched more than 50 vehicles to transport cotton, hemp and other major industrial raw materials to supply the textile industry in Chongqing, Chengdu and other places. The railway department has organized direct special trains for cotton transportation, concentrating a large number of wagons at one time to transport cotton directly from the producing areas to the cities. According to Sichuan's favorable conditions of many rivers and large transport volumes, various places are also vigorously developing water transport and piggyback transport. For example, Nanchong Prefecture used ships carrying steel and grain to carry 15% to 20% of light chemical industry raw materials and small local products, transporting more than 6,000 dan of cotton in less than a month. Mianyang Prefecture also used wooden boats to carry cotton. In order to solve the problem of insufficient short-distance transportation capacity, 70% of the transportation tools in the commercial system in the province's 16 key cotton-producing counties have been engaged in cotton transportation. Santai, Jianyang and other places have also launched a mass short-distance collection and transportation of industrial raw materials.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th -- Changde Prefecture, a major cotton producing area in Hunan Province, has completed this year's national cotton purchase plan ahead of schedule, and has properly arranged for the consumption needs of the masses in accordance with the Party's policies.
	The cotton planted in Changde Prefecture this year suffered continuous attacks from cold waves in the spring, and severe drought and serious insect pests in the summer and autumn. However, due to the improvement of water conservancy conditions in many areas, the enhancement of drought resistance capabilities, the superiority of the people's communes, and the comprehensive cooperation of communes and production teams in labor, tools, and water sources, they carried out a tenacious struggle against natural disasters, and finally achieved a bumper harvest. The Party committees at all levels in the cotton-producing areas prepared early and started early on the cotton purchase work. Before the new cotton was harvested, cotton picking and purchasing command organizations were generally established in various places, and a large number of cadres were sent to the front line of production to earnestly sum up the experience of last year's purchasing work. While grasping grain production, they arranged for nearly 200,000 commune members to specialize in picking cotton. In the early morning and evening, they also organized the vast number of commune members to carry out surprise attacks, so as to pick in a timely manner and send the cotton to their homes. In order to accelerate the progress of new cotton purchase, all localities earnestly implemented the method of centralized picking, centralized processing, and centralized sales, drying the picked cotton on the same day and sending it to the national purchasing station for sale. Commercial personnel went deep into the front line, increased the number of purchasing points, and improved the purchasing methods for the convenience of the people. The commercial departments in various places also adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. On the one hand, the state-owned processing plants processed it, and on the other hand, they concentrated more than 2,500 cotton gins and more than 6,000 commune members to concentrate on ginning, basically keeping the processing work up to pace with the purchase.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th -- Changning County, Yunnan Province, achieved integrated new cotton picking, purchase, processing, and transportation.
	Most of the cotton fields in this county grew well this year. When cotton bolls were spitting out in large quantities, the Changning County Party Committee established a cotton office, and the communes, management districts and production teams also established command teams to uniformly command the new cotton from picking to purchase, processing, and transportation. On the basis of mobilizing the masses, the county formed four teams of pickers, purchasers, processors, and transporters, respectively, to carry out a one-stop competition. The county organized scalesmen, distributors, cooks, and service personnel to go "four to the fields", which greatly accelerated the picking progress. Administrative cadres and financial and trade cadres from the county to the communes also went deep into the front line to ensure that after the new cotton was picked, dried, and graded, it would be purchased in a timely manner and organized for processing. The county organized indigenous and foreign processing and transportation tools to ensure that a large number of new cotton would be transferred to the textile factory shortly after being picked.

    四川及时把收购的农副产品运往城市
    湖南常德专区完成全年棉花收购计划
    云南昌宁新棉采摘、收购、加工、调运一气呵成
    新华社成都10日电　四川省各地及时把收购的棉、麻、烟、茶等农副产品运往城市，支援工厂生产。自新棉上市以来，全省调进重庆和运往上海等地的新棉源源不断，同时调运了十四万多担松香、生漆、五倍子等轻化工业原料和土特产品到省内外许多城市。
    四川省各有关部门都抓紧在当前农副产品采摘、收购季节，作好农副产品初加工和调运工作，以大量新原料供给工厂。纺织工业部门在繁忙的生产中，抽出了职工到各棉花主要产区，和公社社员、商业职工一起，采摘、加工、调运棉花。重庆市裕华、六零一等纺织厂，派了一百多名工人到简阳县各公社和生产队，帮助修理轧花、动力等机械，参加轧花、喂花、打包等工作，加快了棉花调运的速度。四川省棉秆皮产量很大，各有关部门除了协助公社合理安排劳力，做到边拔边剥以外，还供应了五千多台剥棉秆皮的机器，使这些棉秆皮能及时剥下来运出去。
    为了加速农副产品的调运，各地商业部门与轻工业部门配合，成立了联合调运小组，加强领导。全省商业系统抽出五十多辆汽车，调运棉花、麻类等主要工业原料，供应重庆、成都等地纺织工业。铁路部门组织了调运棉花的直达专车，一次集中大量车皮，把棉花从产地直接运往城市。根据四川河流多、运量大这一有利条件，各地还大搞水上运输和捎脚运输。如南充专区利用载运钢铁、粮食的船只，搭15％到20％的轻化工业原料和小土产品，不到一月就运出棉花六千多担。绵阳专区也利用木船捎运了棉花。为了解决短途运输力量不足的问题，全省十六个重点产棉县，已把商业系统70％以上的运输工具从事棉花运输。三台、简阳等地还开展了群众性的工业原料短途集运工作。
    新华社长沙10日电　湖南省的主要产棉区常德专区，已经提前完成今年国家棉花收购计划，并且根据党的政策，妥善安排了群众的消费需要。
    常德专区今年种植的棉花，春季遭受寒潮的连续袭击，夏秋又遭受大旱和严重的虫害，但是由于许多地区水利条件改善，抗旱能力提高，人民公社发挥了优越性，各公社、生产队互相在劳力、工具、水源等方面全面协作，与自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，终于获得了丰收。棉区各级党委对棉花收购工作准备的早、动手的早。在新棉收获以前，各地普遍成立了棉花采摘、收购指挥机构，派出大批干部深入生产第一线，认真总结了去年收购工作的经验，在大抓粮食生产的同时，安排了近二十万社员专门摘花，早晚还组织广大社员突击，做到了及时采摘，朵絮归家。为了加速新棉收购进度，各地认真贯彻了集中采摘、集中加工、集中送售的方法，当天将采摘的棉花晒干，送到国家收购站交售。商业人员深入第一线，增加了收购点，改进了收购方法，便民利民。各地商业部门还采取土洋结合的办法，一方面由国营加工厂加工，一方面集中了二千五百多台轧花机，六千多名社员集中轧花，基本上使加工工作赶上了收购的进度。
    据新华社昆明10日电　云南省昌宁县新棉采摘、收购、加工、调运一气呵成。
    这个县今年大部分棉田成长较好。在棉花大量吐絮的时候，中共昌宁县委就成立了棉花办公室，各公社、管理区和生产队也成立了指挥小组，统一指挥新棉从采摘到收购、加工、调运等工作。在发动群众的基础上，全县分别组成采摘、收购、加工、调运四班人马，开展一条龙竞赛。全县组织了司秤、分晒、炊事和服务人员“四到田”，使采摘进度大大加快。从县到公社的行政干部和财贸干部，还深入第一线保证新棉采摘、晒干、分级以后，及时收购起来组织加工。全县组织了土、洋的加工、运输工具，保证了大批新棉摘下不久，就转运到纺织厂内。（附图片）
