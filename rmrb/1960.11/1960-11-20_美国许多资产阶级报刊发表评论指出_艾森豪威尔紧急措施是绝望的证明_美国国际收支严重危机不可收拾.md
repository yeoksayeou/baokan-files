Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from New York: Many U.S. newspapers admit that the emergency measures announced by Eisenhower on the 16th will not stop the massive outflow of U.S. gold and the increasing weakness of the dollar.

　　The "Washington Post and Times Herald" said that if viewed "from a psychological point of view," these measures can only weaken rather than strengthen confidence in the dollar, because the measures announced by Eisenhower "seem to be proof of desperation."

　　The "Wall Street Journal" said in an editorial that the dollar has reached a critical juncture between maintaining its value (referring to the official price) and devaluation. The newspaper said it would be a mistake to think that these measures would keep the U.S. balance of payments "in balance."

　　The "Wall Street Journal" advocated further measures to stop the outflow of U.S. gold, particularly advocating that the U.S. put more of its financial burden on its Western European partners in the North Atlantic Group. The newspaper estimates that the widening deficit in international payments will "force the next (U.S.) administration to consider this."

　　The "New York American" emphasized that the prestige of the dollar is constantly declining. The newspaper pointed out that in the capitalist world market, people are "now dumping dollars and buying gold whenever possible. If they can't buy gold, they buy Swiss francs or even pounds to protect themselves." The newspaper lamented, "This is a bad sign for us... What is happening now is that the credibility of the dollar as a hard currency is disappearing." The newspaper shouted, "Something needs to be done now, otherwise it will be impossible to avoid (open) devaluation of the dollar."

　　This newspaper reports that American bourgeois newspapers generally expressed extreme anxiety about the massive outflow of American gold and the increasingly serious deficit in the balance of international payments. The November 7th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine published some statistics on U.S. gold reserves. The magazine pointed out that the current gold reserves of the capitalist world total 41.4 billion U.S. dollars, and the U.S. has approximately 18.6 billion U.S. dollars in gold reserves (Editor's note: according to recent news, it has dropped to 18.006 billion U.S. dollars). After deducting 11.6 billion U.S. dollars in gold necessary to support its own currency and deposits, the remaining gold is only 7 billion U.S. dollars (actually only more than 6.4 billion U.S. dollars). However, foreign claims on U.S. gold already amount to 19.5 billion U.S. dollars, so if all foreign creditors demand payment in gold, the U.S. will be short 12.5 billion U.S. dollars. The magazine pointed out that the situation of the U.S. lacking gold has been deteriorating since 1957. For example, at the end of 1957, the amount of this U.S. gold shortage was 4.1 billion U.S. dollars, at the end of 1958 it increased to 7.1 billion U.S. dollars, at the end of 1959 it increased again to 10.4 billion U.S. dollars, and recently it has exceeded 12.5 billion U.S. dollars. And this situation will continue. The reason is that the net income that the United States earns from foreign trade generally does not exceed 5.5 billion U.S. dollars, while the United States spends as much as 8.3 billion U.S. dollars annually on overseas military expenditures, "aid" and private capital exports in order to expand its aggression madly, which causes the annual international balance of payments deficit to increase by at least 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.

　　The October 29th issue of the U.S. "Business Week" also published an article entitled "Gold Is Still the Standard of Currency." The author worriedly stated that U.S. gold could not withstand a long-term massive outflow.

　　After describing that the current U.S. gold reserves are far from enough to meet the needs of foreigners, the author wrote anxiously: "The tricky problem - this is the aspect where psychological effects play a role. As long as foreigners do not lose confidence in the purchasing power of the dollar and the free convertibility of the dollar, there will be no real danger of converting large amounts of dollars into gold... If they think the dollar has weakened compared to other currencies, then people may take some drastic remedies for the Victorian gold standard" (referring to a run on the dollar). The author then said, "No country, not even the United States, can sit idly by and watch its gold reserves flow out indefinitely."

　　On November 17th, the "New York Times" also published an editorial entitled "The Battle for the Dollar," saying, "The serious deterioration of the U.S. international balance of payments deficit, which has caused a gold rush, has prompted President Eisenhower to announce an emergency plan to save $1 billion a year in overseas spending, and to convene a meeting of the National Security Council to discuss defending the dollar - a key factor in our own economic defenses and the economic defenses of the free world. According to a report by the Department of Commerce, the improvement earlier this year has disappeared, and the current (international) balance of payments deficit has reached an annual rate (i.e., the deficit figure that may be reached based on the whole year) of 4.3 billion U.S. dollars."

　　Although the newspaper went on to reassure people that "financial authorities at home and abroad believe that there is no reason to panic," it had to admit that "a persistent deficit will inevitably subject the dollar to international attack," thereby "exposing the United States to a series of political, economic and financial problems."

    美国许多资产阶级报刊发表评论指出
    艾森豪威尔紧急措施是绝望的证明
    美国国际收支严重危机不可收拾
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：美国许多报纸承认，艾森豪威尔16日宣布的紧急措施将不会停止美国黄金大量外流和美元日益虚弱的情况。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”说，如果“从心理的观点”来看，这些措施只能削弱而不会加强对美元的信任，因为艾森豪威尔宣布的措施“看来是一个绝望的证明”。
    “华尔街日报”在一篇社论中说，美元已经到了在维护自己的价值（指官价）和贬值之间的紧要关头。这家报纸说，认为这些措施将可以保持美国国际收支“平衡”将是一个错误。
    “华尔街日报”主张采取进一步措施来制止美国黄金的外流，它特别主张美国更多地把美国的财政负担加在它的北大西洋集团的西欧伙伴身上。这家报纸估计，不断扩大的国际支付的逆差将“迫使下届（美国）政府不得不考虑这一点”。
    “纽约美国人报”强调美元的威信正在不断下降。这家报纸指出，在资本主义世界市场上，人们“现在正在抛出美元，并且只要有可能就购买黄金。如果他们买不到黄金，他们就购买瑞士法朗甚至英镑来保护自己。”这家报纸悲叹说，“这对我们说来是一个糟糕迹象……目前发生的事情是美元作为硬货币的信誉正在消失。”报纸叫喊：“现在需要做些事情了，否则就不可能避免美元（公开）贬值”。
    本报讯　美国资产阶级报刊对于美国黄金大量外流和国际收支逆差日益严重的现象普遍表现了极度焦虑的心情。11月7日“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志刊载了有关美国黄金储备的一些统计资料。这个杂志指出，目前资本主义世界的黄金储备共有四百一十四亿美元，美国手头的黄金储备约为一百八十六亿美元（编者按，最近消息，已下降为一百八十亿零六百万美元）。其中除掉为支持本国货币和存款所必需的一百一十六亿美元黄金之外，剩余黄金仅为七十亿美元（按目前实际上仅余六十四亿多美元）。但现时外国对美国黄金拥有的债权已达一百九十五亿美元，因此如果外国债权全部要求支付黄金，美国就将缺少黄金一百二十五亿美元。这家杂志指出，美国短少黄金的情况从1957年以来就一直在趋向恶化。例如1957年底，美国这一黄金短少的数目是四十一亿美元，1958年底增加到七十一亿美元，1959年底再增加到一百零四亿美元，最近更超过一百二十五亿美元。而这种情况还将继续下去。原因就是美国每年从对外贸易中所赚的纯收入一般不超过五十五亿美元，而美国为了疯狂向外扩张侵略每年用于海外军费开支、“援助”和私人资本输出的花费高达八十三亿美元，这就造成每年国际收支逆差至少要增加二十八亿美元。
    10月29日一期的美国“商业周刊”也刊载了一篇题为“黄金仍然是货币的本位”的文章，作者忧心忡忡地表示，美国黄金经不起长期大量外流。
    作者在叙述了美国现时的黄金储备远不足以满足外国人的需求之后，焦虑地写道：“棘手的问题——这就是心理作用起影响的方面。只要外国人对美元购买力和美元可以自由兑换这一点没有丧失信心，就不会有把大量美元换成黄金的实际危险……如果它们认为美元同其他货币比较之下削弱了，那么人们可能采取对维多利亚时代金本位的某种剧烈的补救办法”（即指挤兑美元）。作者于是说：“没有一个国家，那怕是美国，能够坐视黄金储备无限期地流失的”。
    11月17日，“纽约时报”也以
  “美元的战斗”为题发表社论说，“已经引起抢购黄金风潮的美国国际收支逆差严重恶化，因此艾森豪威尔总统宣布了一项在海外开支方面每年节省十亿美元的紧急计划，并且召开国家安全委员会会议来讨论保卫美元——这个在我们自己的经济防务和自由世界的经济防务中的关键因素。据商务部报告，今年早些时候的好转情况已经消失，目前（国际）收支逆差达到年率（即按全年计算可能达到的逆差数字）四十三亿美元”。
    这家报纸尽管接着就稳定人心地宣传什么美国“国内外的金融界权威人士认为还没有理由感到惊慌”，可是它也不得不承认：“持续的逆差必然会使美元受到国际上的进攻”，从而“使美国面临一系列政治、经济和财政问题”。（附图片）
