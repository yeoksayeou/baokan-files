Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 11th: Since the opening of the Exhibition of Achievements in Economic Construction of the People's Republic of China to the public on the 6th in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, approximately 50,000 people have visited the exhibition. November 11th (Friday) was the first Muslim holiday since the opening of the exhibition, and the number of visitors on that day reached more than 15,000.

During the visitors' tours, various precision machine tools, rotary printing presses, and textile machines in the magnificent exhibition hall were running, emitting a rumbling sound. Neon lights flashed on the automatic models of small iron and steel plants. Various steel products marking the high level of China's steel industry were also on display at the exhibition. Many visitors inquired with great interest about the quantity and price of China's steel production, feeling happy, friendly, and inspired by the achievements of the Chinese people, friends of the Arab people.

Models showcasing water conservancy irrigation and electrification in Chinese People's Communes, as well as pictures reflecting the work, study, and life of commune members, have consistently attracted large numbers of Iraqi farmers. One visitor said, "We should congratulate the Chinese farmers for finding such a good organizational form for themselves."

Many visitors wrote down their impressions of the visit in enthusiastic language in the visitor's book. One visitor wrote, "After seeing the Chinese (economic construction) achievements exhibition, I admire the great leap forward of the great Chinese people under the leadership of their heroic leader Mao Zedong. I admire the heroic people, the people of peace and freedom." Another visitor wrote, "Although I knew about the development and the great leap forward created by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, in fact, I never imagined that the development of People's China would be so enormous. I am indeed amazed."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, November 11th: Many high-ranking Iraqi government officials and prominent social figures have visited the Exhibition of Achievements in Economic Construction of the People's Republic of China held here in the past few days. They all praised China's great achievements in industry and agriculture, and were particularly interested in China's achievements in improving agricultural tools.

Iraqi Minister of State and Acting Minister of Agriculture, Brigadier General Fadhil Arif, along with about twenty other senior officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, visited the exhibition on the 8th, accompanied by Chinese Ambassador Zhang Weilie and Chinese Exhibition Hall Director Zhang Ziquan. He wrote in the visitor's book: "Very admirable is the enormous industrial development we have seen with our own eyes, which includes all aspects of industry and agriculture."

Abdul Jabbar Uwaz, Director of the Agricultural Machinery and Equipment Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, along with about thirty officials and experts, visited the exhibition on the 10th. They carefully studied various agricultural machinery and every simple improved agricultural tool. They expressed that those simple improved agricultural tools gave them great inspiration. They requested that they be able to obtain these agricultural tools after the exhibition is over, as samples for imitation in Iraq. Zhang Ziquan, Director of the Chinese Exhibition Hall, expressed his willingness to provide them with assistance.

When talking about his impression of the exhibition, Uwaz said: "The exhibition shows us that it is possible for Iraq to learn from the experiences of other countries to develop our backward tools, and it also shows us how a backward country can develop its industry and agriculture in a short period of time after liberation, just like what People's China has done in the production of heavy machinery. The similarities between our two countries in the past and other conditions give us confidence in the future and progress."

Approximately fifty senior officials from the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Trade, as well as some senior officials from other ministries and some well-known figures in cultural circles, have also visited the Chinese exhibition in the past few days. Muhammad Salman Hassan, Director of General Affairs of the Ministry of Planning, said that the combination of large, medium, and small-scale technologies in China's agricultural technology is a creative expression of the Chinese people, and it is particularly helpful for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    巴格达公众盛赞中国建设成就
    参观中国展览会的观众已达五万人
    据新华社巴格达11日电　中华人民共和国经济建设成就展览会自从6日下午在伊拉克首都巴格达向公众开放以来，已经有大约五万人参观了这个展览会。11日（星期五）是展览会开幕以来的第一个穆斯林休息日，这一天的观众达一万五千多人。
    在观众参观时，宏伟的展览厅里的各种精密机床、轮转印刷机和纺织机正开动着，发出隆隆的声音。小型炼铁厂和炼钢厂的自动模型上的霓虹灯闪闪发光。标志着中国炼钢工业的高度水平的各种钢产品也在展览会上展出。许多观众怀着极大的兴趣询问着中国钢铁生产的数量、价格等问题，他们为阿拉伯人民的朋友——中国人民的成就而感到高兴、亲切，并受到鼓舞。
    表现中国人民公社的水利灌溉和电气化的模型以及反映公社社员的工作、学习和生活的图片始终吸引着大批伊拉克农民。一位观众说，“我们应当祝贺中国农民给自己找到了很好的组织形式。”
    许多参观者在留言簿上用热情的语言写下了他们参观的印象。一位参观者写道，“我看了中国（经济建设）成就展览会以后，钦佩伟大的中国人民在自己英雄的领袖毛泽东领导下的大跃进。我钦佩英雄的人民、和平和自由的人民。”另一位参观者写道，“尽管我知道中国人民在毛泽东主席领导下所取得的发展和创造的大跃进，但是，事实上我根本没有想像到人民中国的发展有这么巨大。我的确感到惊异。”
    据新华社巴格达11日电　伊拉克政府许多高级官员和著名社会人士在过去几天中参观了在这里举行的中华人民共和国经济建设成就展览会。他们都盛赞中国工农业的巨大成就，并且特别对中国在改良农具方面的成就感到兴趣。
    伊拉克国务部长、代理农业部长法德·阿里夫准将8日同农业部的其他大约二十名高级官员在中国大使张伟烈和中国展览馆馆长张子泉陪同下参观了展览会。他在留言簿上写道：“非常钦佩我们亲眼看到的巨大的工业发展，这些巨大发展包括工农业各个方面”。
    农业部农业机器和设备司司长阿卜杜勒·贾巴尔·乌瓦兹同大约三十名官员和专家在10日参观了展览会。他们仔细研究了各种农业机械和每一件简易的改良农具。他们表示，那些简单的改良农具给他们很大的启发。他们要求在展览会结束以后能够得到这些农具，作为在伊拉克仿造的样品。中国展览馆馆长张子泉表示愿意给予他们帮助。
    乌瓦兹在谈到他对展览会的印象时说：“展览会向我们显示了，伊拉克有可能吸取其他国家的经验来发展我们落后的工具，也向我们显示了，一个落后的国家在解放以后怎样能够在短时期内发展它的工农业，就像人民中国在生产重型机器方面所做的那样。我们两国在过去的相似之处和其他条件使我们对前途和进步有了信心。”
    计划部和贸易部的大约五十名高级官员，以及其他各部的一些高级官员和文化界一些知名人士也在过去几天中参观了中国展览会。计划部总务司司长穆罕默德·萨勒曼·哈桑说，中国在农业技术方面大中小结合的特点是中国人民的创造性的表现，它对于亚非和拉丁美洲的人民特别有帮助。
