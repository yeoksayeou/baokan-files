The head of the Venezuelan Cultural Delegation, Dr. Hector Marcano Guevara, told Xinhua reporters about his impressions of his visit to China, saying that his visit to China has shown us that the socialist system is far better than the capitalist system. In China, there is no hunger, unemployment, prostitutes, or beggars. All the people are working enthusiastically and love peace. They hope for a peaceful international environment to build socialism at home. He enthusiastically praised China's General Line, Great Leap Forward, and People's Communes. He said that the development of China's industry shows the speed of the Great Leap Forward. China's Great Leap Forward will see even greater leaps forward in the near future.

Dr. Guevara also said that China's People's Communes left him with an unforgettable impression. He said that the People's Communes enable all workers to fully utilize their abilities.

Dr. Guevara also spoke in detail about his impressions of China's health work, especially the combination of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. He said that China's health work has adopted a policy of prevention first and following the mass line, which is suitable for China's conditions, and has spent very little money, but has achieved achievements that capitalist countries cannot achieve. He pointed out that China has mobilized thousands of people to participate in the treatment of schistosomiasis and made great contributions. He said that the policy of combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine put forward by the Chinese Communist Party and the government will also bear fruitful results in the future. Condemning the United States' aggression against Cuba, he said that U.S. imperialism fundamentally does not want peaceful coexistence; it is unwilling to live with even its small neighbor Cuba.

Dr. Guevara said that the U.S. imperialist economic blockade of Cuba is doomed to failure. He cited the example of the Soviet Union and China becoming increasingly powerful after being blockaded by imperialism. He said that China has also been blockaded, but the Chinese people have achieved great victories in industry, agriculture, and other fields.

Dr. Guevara also pointed out that the U.S. imperialist economic blockade of Cuba can also be said to be Cuba's good fortune, because from now on, Cuba can no longer import many useless things from the United States, such as pornographic movies and books and magazines that poison Cuban youth. At the same time, the people of socialist countries can provide Cuba with the machinery and technicians needed for industrialization, and all Latin American people will support Cuba.

He also said that during his visit to China, he deeply felt that the Chinese people firmly support the struggle of the Latin American people. Even children in nurseries know the name of Cuba.

    委内瑞拉文化代表团团长谈访华观感
    中国人民热情劳动爱好和平
    人民公社使所有劳动者充分发挥了自己的能力
    委内瑞拉文化代表团团长艾克多尔·马尔卡诺·古埃约博士在我国访问时对新华社记者谈访华观感时说，在中国访问，使我们看到社会主义制度远比资本主义制度要好得多。在中国没有饥饿、失业、妓女、乞丐等，全体人民都在热情地劳动，爱好和平，他们希望有和平的国际环境，在国内建设社会主义。他热情地赞扬了中国的总路线、大跃进和人民公社。他说，中国工业的发展显示了跃进的速度。中国的大跃进在不久将来还会出现更大跃进的局面。
    古埃约博士还说，中国的人民公社给他留下了难忘的印象。他说，人民公社使所有的劳动者充分发挥了自己的能力。
    古埃约博士还详细地谈到了对中国的卫生工作，特别是对中西医结合的印象。他说，中国的卫生工作采取了适合中国情况的以预防为主的方针和走群众路线，花了很少的钱，但是取得了资本主义国家所不能取得的成就。他指出，中国在医治血吸虫病方面动员了成千上万的群众参加，作出了很大的贡献。他说，中国共产党和政府提出的中西医结合的方针，将来也会结出丰硕的果实。在谴责美国对古巴的侵略时，他说，美帝国主义根本不要和平相处，即连小小的邻居古巴，美帝国主义都不愿和她一起生活。
    古埃约博士说，美帝国主义对古巴的经济封锁是注定要失败的。他引用了苏联和中国受到帝国主义封锁后反而日益强盛为例。他说，中国也遭到封锁，但中国人民在工农业和其他方面都取得了巨大的胜利。
    古埃约博士还指出，美帝国主义对古巴的经济封锁也可以说是古巴人民的幸运，因为从今以后，古巴可以不再从美国进口许多无用的东西，如黄色电影和毒害古巴青年的书报杂志。同时，社会主义国家的人民可以提供古巴工业化所需要的机器和技术人员，所有拉丁美洲人民也将支持古巴。
    他还说，他在中国访问期间深深体会到中国人民坚决支持拉丁美洲人民的斗争。甚至于托儿所的孩子也知道古巴这个名字。
