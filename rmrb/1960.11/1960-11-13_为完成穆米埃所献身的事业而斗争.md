Struggle to Complete the Cause to Which Moumié Devoted Himself
To the Editors:
    We, the African (Chad, Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon) students studying in the People's Republic of China, held a gathering in Beijing on November 9 regarding the assassination of Félix-Roland Moumié, President of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, by imperialist elements.

    We believe that the assassination of Moumié by French, British, American imperialists, and West German militarists is a frantic counterattack against the national liberation movement of the African people and the world peace movement.

    Félix-Roland Moumié participated in the establishment of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon in 1948. This organization has tirelessly struggled for the unification and independence of Cameroon, and has therefore been supported by the masses of all strata of society. The imperialists, fearing that they would be driven out of this rich land, were determined to suppress this movement and its leader. In May 1955, the French imperialists carried out a cruel massacre in Cameroon. Moumié and some of his comrades were forced to move, while the General Secretary of the UPC, Ruben Um Nyobé, went into the jungle. In July 1955, the French imperialists declared the UPC illegal. However, the struggle of the UPC, under the tireless activities of President Moumié and General Secretary Ruben Um Nyobé, saw a new upsurge. In 1958, the imperialists, just as they assassinated Moumié today, murdered the General Secretary of the UPC, Ruben Um Nyobé, in the jungle. But the people of Cameroon, united around the vigorous and wise leadership of President Moumié, continued to resist and struggle for national liberation. Moumié had repeatedly gone to the United Nations to state the Cameroonian nation's demand for independence and unification. However, the Cameroonian people, under the leadership of the UPC, received only disappointment from the United Nations, which was controlled by a reactionary majority, and were therefore forced to continue a more comprehensive armed struggle against the colonialists and their lackeys.

    Moumié tirelessly condemned the conspiracies of the imperialists in Africa, especially those of the American imperialists. He constantly called on all peace-loving people to fight against the American imperialists in order to defend world peace.

    As one of the initiators of the All-African Peoples Conference, Moumié advocated correct and necessary methods in various gatherings and organizations to liberate the African continent from all forms of exploitation and from all forms of neo-colonialism.

    Moumié was one of the outstanding heroes and leaders of the liberation struggle on the African continent. He was assassinated by the imperialists in Geneva at the young age of thirty-four.

    The imperialists thought that by assassinating Moumié they could strangle the revolution in Cameroon, but, on the contrary, the crimes of imperialism can only arouse a new upsurge in the Cameroonian revolution and the national liberation movement on the African continent. Moumié's death is another call to Africans to wage a resolute and uncompromising struggle against imperialists and colonialists.

    Immortal hero of the African people, Félix-Roland Moumié, we will work resolutely to struggle to complete the cause to which you devoted yourself!

    Rest in peace, Félix-Roland Moumié!

    Long live the Cameroonian revolution!

    Long live the freedom and prosperity of Africa!

### 为完成穆米埃所献身的事业而斗争

   为完成穆米埃所献身的事业而斗争编辑同志：
    我们在中华人民共和国学习的非洲（乍得、怯尼亚、乌干达、喀麦隆）学生，11月9日在北京就喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·穆米埃被帝国主义分子暗害的事件举行了集会。
    我们认为，法、英、美帝国主义者和西德军国主义者暗杀穆米埃，是对非洲人民的民族解放运动和世界和平运动的一个疯狂的反扑。
    费利克斯·穆米埃在1948年参加了建立喀麦隆人民联盟的工作。这个组织不懈地为喀麦隆的统一和独立而斗争，因而受到全国各阶层群众的拥护。帝国主义者害怕自己会被逐出这个富饶的土地，决心镇压这个运动和它的领袖。1955年5月，法帝国主义者在喀麦隆进行了残酷的屠杀。穆米埃和他的一部分战友被迫转移，而人民联盟总书记鲁本·于姆·尼奥勃则进入丛林。法帝国主义者于1955年7月宣布喀麦隆人民联盟为非法。但是，喀麦隆人民联盟的斗争在穆米埃主席和鲁本·于姆·尼奥勃总书记的不倦的活动下有了新的高涨。1958年，帝国主义者像在今天杀害穆米埃一样，在丛林里杀害了喀麦隆人民联盟总书记鲁本·于姆·尼奥勃。但是喀麦隆人民团结在穆米埃主席的生气勃勃的、英明的领导的周围，继续进行反抗斗争以求民族解放。穆米埃曾经数度前往联合国申述喀麦隆民族必须独立、统一的主张。但是，在人民联盟领导下的喀麦隆人民，从被反动多数所控制的联合国那里得到的只是失望，因而不得不对殖民者及其仆从继续进行更全面化的武装斗争。
    穆米埃不倦地谴责帝国主义者在非洲的阴谋，尤其是美帝国主义者在非洲的阴谋。他不断号召全人类爱好和平的人们对美帝国主义者进行斗争以保卫世界和平。
    作为全非人民大会的发起人之一，穆米埃在各种集会和组织中赞成解放非洲大陆脱离一切形式的剥削、脱离新殖民主义的各种正确和必要的办法。
    穆米埃是非洲大陆解放斗争的杰出英雄和领袖之一。他在年仅三十四岁的时候，就被帝国主义者在日内瓦杀害了。
    帝国主义者以为暗杀了穆米埃就可以扼杀喀麦隆的革命，但是，相反地，帝国主义的罪恶只能激起喀麦隆的革命和非洲大陆民族解放运动的新的高涨。穆米埃的死，向非洲人再一次发出号召，要求非洲人对帝国主义者和殖民主义者进行坚决的、不妥协的斗争。
    永垂不朽的非洲人民的英雄费利克斯·穆米埃，我们将坚决努力，为完成你所献身的事业而斗争！
    费利克斯·穆米埃，安息吧！
    喀麦隆革命万岁！
    非洲的自由与繁荣万岁！
