Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 16th: Currently, there are 180,000 young people in Czechoslovakia active on the agricultural production front. To ensure sufficient labor in rural areas, more than 30,000 young people have taken on the glorious post of agricultural labor each year in recent years. Since the beginning of this year, as of July, 31,000 young people have participated in agricultural labor.

To strive for high yields of crops and livestock products, young farmers have formed 1,300 youth collectives and are engaged in competitions under the guidance of experienced veteran farmers. More than 300 of these collectives are striving for the glorious title of "Socialist Labor Team."

Many young people who love agricultural labor have made outstanding achievements. For example, in the Komutov area, a young man named Novak sowed 200 hectares of corn by himself. Combine harvester operators Sroz and Kolar from the Breclav State Farm harvested 226 hectares of wheat. Rural youth have also become an extremely active force in promoting new technologies. This year, in addition to completing soil improvement work on 30,000 hectares of land, they have also accumulated 2 million cubic meters of fertilizer, which is equivalent to one-fifth of the national fertilizer accumulation plan.

The government provides young people participating in agricultural labor with various opportunities for improvement. To enable young people who have just completed eight or nine years of compulsory education to quickly master the basic knowledge and experience of planting crops or raising livestock, 259 agricultural apprentice schools have been established across the country, with more than 40,000 young people studying in these schools. They spend half of their time engaging in production internships in agricultural cooperatives or state farms. In addition to agricultural apprentice schools, 178 primary agricultural technical schools are opened during the agricultural off-season, with approximately 9,430 students.

In addition, a large number of young people are studying in various correspondence schools.

    加强农村劳力争取农作物和畜产品高产
    捷广大青年活跃在农业战线
    据新华社布拉格16日电　目前捷克斯洛伐克有十八万青年活跃在农业生产战线上。为了使农村有足够的劳动力，最近几年来，每年有三万多青年走上农业劳动的光荣岗位。今年以来到7月为止，已有三万一千个青年参加了农业劳动。
    青年农民们为了争取农作物和畜产品的高产，组成了一千三百个青年集体，在有经验的老农指导下展开了竞赛。其中有三百个以上的集体正在争取“社会主义劳动队”的光荣称号。
    热爱农业劳动的青年中有不少人作出了优秀的成绩，如在高穆托夫地方，一个姓诺瓦克的青年一人播种玉米二百公顷。布雷茨拉夫国营农场的联合收割机手斯罗兹和科拉尔收打小麦达二百二十六公顷。在推进新技术方面，农村青年也成为一支极为活跃的力量。今年他们除了完成在三万公顷土地上的土壤改良工作以外，还积肥达二百万立方米，这相当于全国积肥计划的五分之一。
    政府给予参加农业劳动的青年以各种提高的机会。为了使刚受完八、九年制义务教育的青年迅速掌握种植农作物或饲养牲畜的基本知识和经验，全国设立了二百五十九个农业学徒学校，有四万多青年在这些学校中学习，他们用一半时间在农业合作社或在国营农场里从事生产实习。除农业学徒学校外，还在农闲季节开设了一百七十八个初级农业技术学校，约有学生九千四百三十人。
    此外，还有大批青年在各种函授学校学习。
