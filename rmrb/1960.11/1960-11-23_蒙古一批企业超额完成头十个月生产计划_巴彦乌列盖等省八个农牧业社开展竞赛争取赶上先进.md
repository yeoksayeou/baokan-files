Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar Electric Dispatch: Some factories and enterprises in Mongolia have achieved outstanding production results in the first ten months of this year.

　　The largest factory in Mongolia, the Choibalsan Industrial Union Factory, produced products worth 48.9 million tugriks (Mongolian currency) in the first ten months of this year. The wool textile factory in this union factory excellently completed its task in the socialist labor competition, producing more than ten kinds of high-quality wool fabrics. Each workshop completed the production plan for the first ten months of this year with a score of 100% to 102.6%. The sewing factory also overfulfilled the production plan for the first ten months by 107.5%.

　　The Ulaanbaatar Woodworking Factory exceeded its October production plan by 3.4%. So far, the factory has produced products worth 11.5 million tugriks, which is 700,000 tugriks more than the total production value of the entire year of last year. This factory completed the 1958-1960 production plan six months ahead of schedule in June this year, and the workers are currently working on tasks for 1961. More than 70 advanced workers in the factory completed three to six years' worth of work in two years and eight months.

　　Good news from the local industrial production front also poured in. The Bayan-Ulgii Province Food Processing Factory has already completed 110.1% of its annual production plan ahead of schedule, increasing labor efficiency by 11%. The employees of the province's handicraft cooperatives also completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. The South Gobi Province Food United Factory completed its annual production plan for soap and pastries within ten months.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar Electric Dispatch: Damdin, the second secretary of the Party Committee of the Ulaanbaatar Railway Bureau in Mongolia, recently told Xinhua reporters that, driven by the socialist labor team movement, the bureau, after completing the three-year plan for cargo transportation one year ahead of schedule in 1959, also overfulfilled various production plans for the first ten months of this year.

　　He said that after the first socialist labor team in the Ulaanbaatar Railway Bureau Locomotive Repair Factory won this glorious title last spring, the movement to strive for the title of socialist labor team was widely launched in the railway bureau.

　　He said that the First Congress of Socialist Labor Teams of Railway Workers held by the Railway Bureau in the first quarter of this year proposed an initiative: to call on employees to work and study in a socialist manner, practice thrift, improve labor productivity, and strive to complete this year's national production plan ahead of schedule and beyond the target. This conference further promoted the development of this movement. Now, more than 60% of the employees in the bureau, a total of more than 380 working teams, have participated in this movement, and nine of them have won the title of socialist labor team.

　　He pointed out that in this movement, employees helped each other and improved their technical level. The freight transport plan for the first ten months of this year has been overfulfilled by 12.6%, the passenger transport plan by 19.2%, the cost has been reduced by 11.9%, and the labor productivity has been increased by 17.5%. More than 7,600 over-axle trains have been sent out successively, transporting 2.33 million tons of extra goods. The political and ideological level of the employees has also been improved. Many advanced individuals and advanced deeds have emerged. For example, Galaasantaukt, a train driver at the Zhongkhala Station, carried 2,500 tons of cargo in a single shipment, exceeding the quota by 1,000 tons, and safely transported it to the destination, thus creating a new record for over-axle freight transportation in the Mongolian railway.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar Electric Dispatch: The heads of eight agricultural and pastoral cooperatives in five provinces of the People's Republic of Mongolia, including Bayan-Ulgii, recently held an experience exchange meeting at the "Happy Life" Cooperative in Khovd Province, and decided to launch a competition to learn from the advanced experience of the "Happy Life" Cooperative and strive to catch up with this cooperative.

　　All members of the "Happy Life" Cooperative tapped their potential and actively developed production, increasing the number of livestock year after year for the past three years. This year's plan for increasing livestock was completed by 109%; at the same time, the output of livestock products was increased, and income was increased as a result, so the cooperative is developing and consolidating day by day.

　　In order to realize the call of the Second Congress of Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperative Members, this cooperative carried out settlement work. Offices, libraries, clubs, power stations, and dormitories were built in the center of the cooperative and in the production teams. Trees and grass were planted to beautify the environment, and cultural studies were organized, and various cultural and sports activities were carried out. Illiteracy has now been eliminated among adults. The cooperative also frequently helps members improve their political awareness and enthusiasm for labor.

　　After exchanging experiences, the heads of the eight agricultural and pastoral cooperatives in the five provinces wrote to the national agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, expressing their intention to learn from the experience of the "Happy Life" Cooperative, to better organize labor and develop production, and to gradually realize settlement. At the same time, they also expressed that they would improve leadership methods, listen to the opinions of the masses, do a good job in preparing for the wintering of livestock this year, and strive to better complete the plan for livestock increase in 1961, and further develop agriculture and other sideline production.

    蒙古一批企业超额完成头十个月生产计划
    巴彦乌列盖等省八个农牧业社开展竞赛争取赶上先进
    新华社乌兰巴托电　蒙古一些工厂企业在今年头十个月中取得了出色的生产成绩。
    蒙古最大的工厂——乔巴山工业联合工厂在今年头十个月中共生产了价值四千八百九十万图格里克
  （蒙币）的产品。这个联合工厂中的毛纺厂出色地完成了它在社会主义劳动竞赛中承当的任务，共生产了十多种质量良好的毛织品，各个车间分别以100％到102.6％的成绩完成了今年头十个月的生产计划。缝纫厂也以107.5％的成绩超额完成了头十个月的生产计划。
    乌兰巴托木器工厂超额3.4％完成了10月份生产计划。到目前为止，这个工厂已生产了价值一千一百五十万图格里克的产品，比去年全年的生产总值还多七十万图格里克。这个工厂在今年6月就已提前半年完成了1958—1960年的生产计划，工人们目前正在做着1961年的工作。全厂在两年八个月中作完三年到六年的工作量的先进工人达七十多名。
    地方工业生产战线上的捷报也纷纷传来。巴彦乌列盖省食品加工厂已经提前完成了全年生产计划的110.1％，提高劳动效率11％。全省手工业合作社的职工们也提前完成了年度生产计划。南戈壁省的食品联合工厂在十个月内就已完成了全年生产肥皂和点心的计划。
    新华社乌兰巴托电　蒙古乌兰巴托铁路局党委第二书记达木丁最近对新华社记者说，这个局在争取社会主义劳动队运动的推动下，继1959年提前一年完成三年计划的货物运输任务以后，又超额完成了本年头十个月的各项生产计划。
    他说，去年春天乌兰巴托铁路局机车修理厂第一个社会主义劳动队获得这个光荣称号以后，接着争取社会主义劳动队称号的运动便在这个铁路局广泛展开。
    他说，今年第一季度铁路局召开的铁路工人社会主义劳动队第一次会议提出倡议：号召职工们按照社会主义方式工作和学习，厉行节约，提高劳动生产率，争取提前超额完成今年国家生产计划。这次会议进一步推动了这个运动的开展。现在，全局60％以上的职工，共有三百八十多个工作队，都参加了这一运动，其中九个队获得了社会主义劳动队的称号。
    他指出，在这个运动中，职工们相互帮助，提高了技术水平。今年头十个月的货运计划已超额12.6％完成，客运计划超额19.2％完成，成本降低了11.9％，劳动生产率提高了17.5％，曾先后发出七千六百多列超轴列车，多运货物二百三十三万吨。职工们的政治思想水平也有了提高。出现了不少先进人物和先进事迹。如中哈拉车站火车司机嘎拉桑陶克特在一次运货中列车载重二千五百吨，超过定额一千吨，安全运到目的地，因而创造了蒙古铁路超轴货运的新纪录。
    新华社乌兰巴托电　蒙古人民共和国巴彦乌列盖等五个省的八个农牧业合作社社长最近在科布多省“幸福生活”合作社举行经验交流会，决定开展学习“幸福生活”合作社开展竞赛的先进经验，争取赶上这个合作社。
    “幸福生活”合作社全体社员挖掘潜力，积极发展生产，最近三年来年年增殖牲畜。今年的增殖牲畜计划完成109％；同时提高了畜产品的产量，收入也因而增加，合作社日益发展和巩固。
    这个合作社为实现第二次农牧业合作社社员会议的号召，开展了定居工作。在社的中心和生产队兴修了办公室、图书馆、俱乐部、发电站和宿舍等，植树种草美化了环境，并组织文化学习，开展各种文娱体育活动。现在在成年人中已经扫除了文盲。合作社还经常帮助社员提高政治觉悟和劳动的积极性。
    五个省的八个农牧业合作社社长在交流经验以后，写信给全国农牧业合作社，表示要学习“幸福生活”合作社的经验，更好地组织劳动，发展生产，逐步实现定居。同时他们还表示要改进领导方法，听取群众意见，做好今年牲畜的过冬准备工作，争取在1961年更好地完成牲畜增殖计划，进一步发展农业和其它副业生产。图为蒙古包尔努尔国营农场的工人在机械化挤奶房挤牛奶。新华社稿
