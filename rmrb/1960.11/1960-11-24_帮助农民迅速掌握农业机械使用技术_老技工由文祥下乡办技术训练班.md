To Help Farmers Quickly Master Agricultural Machinery Usage Technology
Veteran Technician You Wenxiang Goes to the Countryside to Run Technical Training Classes
(Our dispatch) You Wenxiang, the Red Banner Holder from the Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation's Mechanical and Power Station, known for quickly training apprentices, led four veteran technicians to run an amateur technical training class in Pengxing People's Commune, Xiaogan County. In one month, they trained a group of technical workers who could independently operate and repair new-style farm tools, setting an example for quickly and effectively training technical personnel in rural areas.

In early August, You Wenxiang and four other veteran technicians from the Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Corporation's Mechanical and Power Station came to Pengxing Commune. At that time, the rice was being irrigated, at the critical juncture of needing water for filling the grains, but the weather refused to rain for more than 20 days. At the same time, the commune's land reclamation task was also very urgent. Therefore, there was an urgent need to use pumps and tractors. However, the commune's 101 pumps frequently broke down, and the utilization rate of the 14 tractors and one car was only about 30%, urgently needing repair. However, the people at the commune's machinery station were all farmers who had just put down their hoes, and none of them knew how to repair machines. Faced with this situation, You Wenxiang and the other master craftsmen felt that it was not enough for just the five of them to rush to repair the machines. At this time, they remembered the instructions of the secretary of the Mechanical and Power Station Party Committee before they left: "Be sure to make the farmers understand technology and master machines just like you." So, while immediately engaging in drought resistance and repair, they suggested running an amateur training class to impart technology. The commune Party committee strongly supported this idea, and under the direct leadership of the commune Party committee, the training class was quickly established.

After the amateur technical training class was established, You Wenxiang and other master craftsmen closely integrated it with the actual situation in rural areas and determined that the training class's teaching policy would be: combining theory with practice, focusing on on-site teaching and object teaching, combined with lecturing on systematic technical knowledge. Because rural areas urgently needed technical knowledge in mechanical maintenance at that time, the content of the teaching focused on internal combustion engine repair, and helped to establish a mechanical maintenance system. The source of the teaching materials was: do what, compile what, teach what, compile and teach on the spot. In order to meet the needs of the rural drought resistance struggle, the training class adopted flexible teaching methods, attending classes in the morning and evening, fighting drought during the day, and taking advantage of any free time. Tractor construction sites and pumping stations were all classrooms, blackboards were hung on trees, and machine stands were used as desks. The students in the training class only had elementary school and junior high school education levels, and most of them did not understand any mechanical maintenance technology, nor could they understand drawings. In view of this situation, they focused on simplicity and clarity when lecturing, and adopted the "speak, compare, look, do" teaching method. For example, when technician Sun Benheng explained the structure and performance of the engine, he used a waterwheel as a metaphor, comparing the hand pulling the waterwheel to the piston of the engine, the connecting rod of the engine to the handle of the waterwheel, and the shaft of the engine to the shaft of the waterwheel. The energy of gasoline combustion drives the engine, just like a person using force to drive the waterwheel. The students could all understand and comprehend it thoroughly.

You Wenxiang and other master craftsmen regarded cultivating rural technical forces as their own responsibility and wholeheartedly taught the farmers to learn technology. During the tense drought resistance, the master craftsmen went to places dozens of miles away to repair machines during the day, and rushed back to teach classes at night. Late at night, when everyone else was asleep, they were still compiling handouts and preparing lessons.

After one month of hard work by the five teachers, You Wenxiang and others, the seeds of technology quickly took root and sprouted. At the end of the training class, of the thirty-odd students, fourteen had mastered the technology to independently operate and perform medium-level repairs on machinery, and in general, they had learned the maintenance knowledge of various machines in the commune. The average score on the exam was seventy-seven points. After the graduation of the first phase of the training class, You Wenxiang also used his Sunday rest time to go to the countryside to tutor the students. (Attached picture)

    帮助农民迅速掌握农业机械使用技术
    老技工由文祥下乡办技术训练班
    本报讯　以快速培训徒工出名的红旗手武钢机械动力站由文祥，率领四名老技工到孝感县朋兴人民公社举办的业余技术训练班。在一个月的时间内培养出一批能独立操作和修理新式农具的技术工人，为农村快速地有效地培训技术力量作出了榜样。
    8月初，武钢机械动力站由文祥等五名老技工来到朋兴公社。那时，稻子正灌浆，处在桶水斗谷的节骨眼上，老天爷偏偏二十多天不下雨。这时，社里开荒的任务又很迫切。因此，迫切需要使用抽水机和拖拉机。而社里的一百零一台抽水机经常出故障，十四台拖拉机和一部汽车利用率只及30％左右，急待检修。可是，社里机械站的人都是刚丢下锄头的农民，没有一个会修。由文祥等老师傅面临这种情况，觉得光靠五个人去抢修机器还是不行。这时他们想起临行前机械动力站党委书记的嘱托：“一定要使农民和你们一样，懂得技术，掌握机器。”于是他们一面立即投入抗旱抢修，一面建议办业余训练班传授技术。公社党委大力支持了这个意见，在公社党委的直接领导下，训练班迅速办起来了。
    业余技术训练班办起来后，由文祥等老师傅紧密结合农村实际，确定训练班的教学方针是：理论联系实际，以现场教学、实物教学为主，结合讲授系统的技术知识。由于农村当时迫切需要机械维修保养方面的技术知识，教学的内容便以内燃机修理为主，并帮助建立机械维护保养制度。教材的来源是：干什么、编什么、教什么，现编现教。为了适应农村抗旱斗争的需要，训练班采用灵活的教学方式，早晚上课，白天抗旱，见空就钻，拖拉机工地和抽水机站都是课堂，树上挂黑板，机台当课桌。训练班学员的文化水平都只有初小和高小程度，大部分人不懂一点机械维修保养技术，也看不懂图样。他们根据这一情况，在讲课时注意力求简单通俗，采用“讲、比、看、干”教学法。如技术员孙本衡在讲发动机的构造和性能时，就拿水车作比喻，把人拉水车的手比作发动机的活塞，把发动机的连杆比作水车的柄，把发动机的轴比作水车的轴。汽油燃烧的能把发动机一带动，就好像人一使劲把水车带动起来一样。学员听了，都能理解，懂得透彻。
    由文祥等老师傅把培养农村技术力量当做本身的职责，全心全意地教农民学技术。在紧张的抗旱中，老师傅都是白天到十几里甚至几十里远的地方去抢修机器，晚上又赶回来教课。深夜，大家都睡了，他们还在编讲义和备课。
    经过由文祥等五位老师傅一个月的刻苦办学，使技术的种子很快地生根发芽。训练班结束时，三十多个学员中，有十四个掌握了能单独操作和中修机械的技术，一般都学会了社里各种机械的维护保养知识，考试成绩平均七十七分。由文祥在第一期训练班结业后，还利用星期天休息时间下乡去对学员进行辅导。（附图片）
