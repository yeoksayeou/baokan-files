    Exposing Imperialism's "Goodwill Measures"
    Regret over the "gradual loss of power" and a call to "protect sovereignty" is one of the important themes of Zheng Guanying (Taozhai)'s "Lofu Waiting for Crane Mountain House Poetry Collection." He loudly exclaimed, "Profits and rights fall into foreign hands," and "Profits and rights are entirely held by foreigners." He repeatedly provided concrete materials on imperialism's forceful seizure of taxation, postal service, and mining in China. In the "Protecting Sovereignty" section, the situation in the customs is particularly reflected:
    ...Financial power is in the customs, commercial levies and postal taxes are provided to the treasury. The general key is exclusively controlled by Hart, and even Chinese officials are not allowed to assist. Foreigners are employed as customs tax commissioners, and only foreigners are allowed to be hired. ...
    There is also a note saying: "The Customs Tax Commissioner also manages the postal service." Hart was British and served as the Inspector General of Customs, acting as a "internal spy for the enemy," often "threatening and intimidating" China (Yang Ji, "Guangxu Trade List," Table 3). The foreign advisors at the time were basically all figures of this type. Therefore, his "Foreign Advisors" section exposes these people, saying: "Foreign advisors are used to control me, not me using foreign advisors. The reason for hiring advisors is that all countries compete. They interfere in my government affairs, and claim it's because of friendship. They either deceive or intimidate, and threaten to leave the capital at every turn. ...Even discussing the tax commissioner, how can it be called fair? Chinese are not allowed to fill the position, is there not a single loyal one? Customs declarations use the Western calendar (i.e., Gregorian calendar), and the language is English. ...If compatriots know shame, they should be determined to train a people's militia." He witnessed such situations, where even China could not decide the tax amount, resulting in massive imports of foreign goods and opium, and a massive outflow of silver. He was extremely indignant and advocated direct armed struggle with imperialism.

    Also paying attention to this aspect of the theme was Ni Zaitian (Zixin), the author of "Kusheng Songzhai Collection." He was "worried like fire, thinking of the nation's difficulties," and wrote "Taxation," believing that letting imperialists manage the customs was no different from "tigers and leopards guarding the gate," equivalent to handing them the keys to China. Filled with anxiety, he sang a song of sorrow and indignation: "A hundred rivers in a wild surge, how can they be controlled?" The poem says:
    Now I am not happy, driving that carriage. Tigers and leopards guarding the gate, I turn back to my hut. Where do the merchants come from? Wearing short rough clothes (wearing short rough clothes, with beards). Duliang ?? (fine cloth mat), valuing a thousand times. Lightly dressed clerks, with white hats and reaching the fence (white hat). Refusing to accept the offering, offering the key to the barbarians. The sea hangs down, the Great Wall cuts across. East, west, north, south, summer ice, spring snow. Picking the essence, like sand leaking water. The divine turtle has no breath, it will surely die in the end. Losing my rights, who will stop the crows? Want to draw my bow, and divine my fate again (using grass to predict good and bad luck). A hundred rivers in a wild surge, how can they be controlled?
    In the note to his "Six Character Poems" - Number Seven, he pointed out: "The tax, salt tax, and tariffs of all provinces must be managed by foreigners. Discarding those who are broken and used, they exhaust their profits to repay national debts." He lamented, "Rivers and marshes are dirty, good jade is hidden (even good jade escapes and hides), mountains and seas are controlled by officials without power, hundreds of rooms are full and suddenly empty, what sorrow can be suspended for long?" The copper mountain collapsed ("The copper mountain collapsed and does not respond"), the people are hungry and cold ("Babies look up for milk, I pity them"), the wealth of the Chinese people is plundered by imperialism, he cried out that such a situation cannot be allowed to continue for long.

    He believed that imperialism's method of oppressing China was "like sand sifting water, first draining its essence; like striking fish in the deep, who holds the sleeve?" ("Ancient Imitation"). In the preface, he revealed the following statistics, saying, "Now, those who manage our tariffs are 151 Englishmen, 25 Germans, 16 Americans, 11 Russians, 8 Italians, 6 Portuguese, 6 Dutch, 2 Australians, 2 Spaniards, 6 Swedes, and 6 Japanese. Norway, Belgium, and Denmark used to have some but no longer do. There are a total of 112 people." Their annual salaries are: Inspector General of Customs 24,000 taels, Deputy Tax Commissioner 18,000 taels. Customs Chief 9,200 taels to 15,000 taels, Deputy Customs Chief 7,500 taels to 8,400 taels. Assistants in four grades, from 6,000 taels to 1,800 taels. He wrote with emotion:
    "They are used not too little, and fed not too poorly! Counting the cost of customs duties in the world for forty or fifty years, how can this be counted? I will further verify their records." In fact, this is only a single system's figures in the late Qing period, how vast and shocking!

    The same is true in other aspects. For example, Xu Luan's "New Yuefu" (Volume Down of "Conggui Mountain House Poetry Collection") preface records that the "foreign instructors" for training troops in Tianjin were paid "more than 30,000 gold taels per month." During one period, "purchasing weapons" reached over ten million. Buying two German "ironclad ships" cost 1.6 million taels, and they could not be delivered for six or seven years. The "telegraph bureau" also had to ask foreigners to take care of it, and there were foremen, foreign students, clerks, and other titles. These people also carried out espionage activities, so he also wrote "Advisors," exposing the darkness in this area.

    These poems and casually collected figures prove that imperialism in China at that time was like tigers and wolves, frantically and cruelly plundering and controlling China's economic lifeline. They also confirm why imperialist countries' churches and "charitable" organizations invested so much in China, where the money came from, and some of the factors in the growth of the Chinese people's resistance to imperialism.

    读书札记

    揭露帝国主义的“善意措施”
    感慨于“大权日旁落”，而呼吁“保主权”，是郑观应（陶斋）《罗浮待鹤山房诗集》的重要主题之一。他大声疾呼：“利权落外洋”、“利权尽为外人握”。他一再具体的提供了帝国主义在中国强据税务、邮政和矿务的材料。在《保主权》篇里，特别反映了海关方面情况：
    ……财政大权在海关，商征邮税供天府。专司总钥为赫德，副以华员亦不许。海关税司用西人，不是西人不许雇。……
    并有注云：“海关税务司兼管邮政”。赫德是英国人，任总税务司，“为敌内间”，常常对中国“要挟恐喝”（杨楫《光绪通商列表》表三引）。当时的外国顾问，基本上都是这样类型的人物。所以他的《客卿》篇揭露这些人道：“客卿竟用我，非我用客卿。所以聘顾问，各国无不争。干预我政事，反说因交情。非骗即恐吓，动辄要出京。……即论税务司，安得谓公平？华人不准充，岂无一忠诚？报关用西历（即公历），文字用大英（即英文）。……同胞如知耻，发愤练民兵”。他目击这样一些情况，甚至连决定税额中国都做不得主，因而外货、鸦片大量的输入，白银大量的外流，愤慨极了，主张直截了当的和帝国主义进行武装斗争。
    同时注意到这一方面主题的，还有《枯生松斋集》的作者倪在田（子新）。他“忧心如焚，念国之难”，写了《税务篇》，认为让帝国主义者管理海关，无异于“虎豹当关”，等于把中国的锁钥送给他们。他满怀忧虑，慷慨悲歌：“百川狂澜，何以制之？”诗云：
    今我不乐，驾彼辕车（马车）。虎豹当关，翩然反庐。贾胡（帝国主义者）何来？短褐于思（穿粗短衣，有胡须）。都梁??（细布毛席），估值千回。翩翩小吏，白衣接篱（白帽）。纳手不入，奉籥（同钥）于夷。海水云垂，长城横绝。东西南北，夏冰春雪。搴摘菁华，如沙漏水。神龟无气，终则必死。失我利权，瞻乌谁止？欲张我弧，复筮我蓍（用草卜休咎）。百川狂澜，何以制之？
    他在《六言诗》之七的题注里，指出：“诸省税厘盐课，必尸以洋人。舍诸破用者，罄其嬴以偿国债。”他慨叹“川泽污兮瑾匿（连好玉都逃藏了），山海官兮无权，百室盈兮忽罄，愁何可兮久悬？”铜山倒了（“铜山倾兮不应”），人民饥寒交迫（“婴仰乳兮我怜”），中国人的财富，被帝国主义掠夺尽了，他惊叫这样的局面，不能听它长久下去。
    他认为帝国主义这样压迫中国的办法，是“如沙濿水，先漉其华；如渊殴鱼（以木击之），孰执其袪（衣袖）”（《拟古》）。他在叙引里揭出下列统计数字，说“今司我榷税者，英吉利一百五十一人，德意志二十五人，美利坚十六人，俄罗斯十一人，意大利八人，葡萄牙六人，荷兰六人，澳大利亚、西班牙各二人，瑞典六人，日本亦六人，而挪威、比利时、丹麦昔有今无者不及焉。凡一百一十二人”。这些人的年薪是：总税务司二万四千两，副税务司一万八千两。关长九千二百两至一万五千两，副关长七千五百两至八千四百两。帮办四等，从六千两至一千八百两。他感慨的写道：
  “用之不为不多矣，食之不为不厚矣！总计四、五十年间天下关税之所耗者，即此岂可数耶？吾将更核其册焉”。事实上，这还只是在清末时期一个体系的数字，是多么庞大惊人啊！
    其他方面也是一样。如许銮《新乐府》
  （《丛桂山房诗钞》卷下）小引，就记录着当时为天津练兵的“洋教习”，“月糜饷三万余金”，一个时期“购兵器”就达千余万，买两只德国“铁甲船”就是一百六十万两，还六、七年不能交货，“电报局”也要请洋人照料，并有工头、洋学生、司事等等名目。这些人同样执行着间谍活动，所以他还写了《顾问篇》，揭穿这一方面的黑暗。
    这些诗篇和随手摭拾的数字，证明帝国主义那时在中国，像虎狼一样在疯狂、残酷的掠夺，控制中国的经济命脉，也证实了帝国主义国家教会、“慈善”机关在中国投资多，是为的什么，钱是从哪里来的，以及中国人民反抗帝国主义力量之所以成长的某些因素。
