    Our newspaper reports that Xinglongtai in Qingyuan County, Liaoning Province, is using peat to generate methane, opening up new energy sources for power machinery in urban and rural areas. The materials for building peat methane stoves are mainly soil and red bricks, and the operation is easy.

    The comprehensive utilization and processing factory has built two earthen methane stoves. One stove burns 400 jin of peat, and the methane generated can drive an 18-horsepower methane engine to run continuously for about 12 hours. The other stove burns 500-600 jin of peat, and the methane generated supplies two boilers for steaming fertilizers and pesticides, shortening the steaming time by one hour. In three months, a total of more than 25,000 jin of charcoal and a large amount of coal have been saved, as well as manpower and transportation capacity. At the same time, coal tar and ammonia water have been extracted from the peat methane stove, which are good fuels and fertilizers for industrial and agricultural production. The Menlian Production Brigade of Caoshi Commune uses an earthen methane stove to drive a universal threshing machine, saving more than 80 jin of diesel per day and threshing 30,000 to 40,000 jin of soybeans per day, which is equivalent to the work of more than ten people and five horses for ten days. The Xinglongtai Production Team has also built three methane stoves, and the methane generated is enough for three canteens, each serving more than 300 people, to cook, stir-fry dishes, and boil water.

    动力机械的新能源
    本报讯　辽宁省清原县兴隆台利用草炭发生瓦斯，为城乡动力机械开辟了新的能源。建造草炭瓦斯炉的材料主要是泥土和红砖，而且操作容易。
    资源综合利用加工厂建了两个土瓦斯炉，一个烧四百斤草炭，发出的瓦斯可带动十八马力的瓦斯机连续运转十二个小时左右；另一个烧五、六百斤草炭，发出的瓦斯供蒸煮化肥、农药的两个锅炉使用，蒸煮时间缩短一个小时。三个月，共节省二万五千多斤木炭和大量煤炭，并节省了人力和运力。同时还从草炭瓦斯炉中，提取了煤焦油和氨水，而这又是工农业生产中的好燃料、肥料。草市公社门脸生产大队利用土瓦斯炉带动万能脱谷机，每天可省柴油八十多斤，每天能打大豆三万至四万斤，等于十多人和五匹马干十天的活。兴隆台生产队也建立了三座瓦斯炉，发生的瓦斯足够三个各三百多人吃饭的食堂做饭、炒菜，烧水使用。
