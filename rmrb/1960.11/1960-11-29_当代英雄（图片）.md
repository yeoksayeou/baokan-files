Contemporary Hero
Huang Rongchang, a nationally renowned innovator and trail-blazer, and the deputy chief engineer of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company who started as a carpenter, recently created a "simple dumper truck" together with technicians and workers. This dumper truck is converted from old carriage skins. It is simple to manufacture, requires less material, and can automatically unload. It only takes two minutes to unload a carriage of materials. It is not only suitable for slag discharge inside the steel plant, but also for unloading and transporting materials such as pig iron and lump coal. It has broad promotion value. This is Huang Rongchang (center) and others installing pulleys on the "simple dumper truck." Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Shilin photographed.
