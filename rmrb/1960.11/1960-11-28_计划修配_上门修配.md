Further improving the repair and assembly of farm tools is an important task for industry to support agriculture at present. An important aspect of "further improvement" is to change from "waiting for goods to arrive" to "door-to-door repair and assembly," and to combine "planned repair and assembly" with "repairing items as they come," so that the repair and assembly of farm tools can better adapt to the needs of the new situation of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production.

Since the Party Central Committee issued the great call for the whole party and the whole people to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, not only agricultural machinery manufacturing plants directly serving agricultural production have achieved "we repair whatever the farmers send," but other factories and mining enterprises have also enthusiastically accepted the repair and assembly work that farmers bring to their doors. This has won the enthusiastic praise of the broad masses of farmers. However, according to the requirements of the new situation of the whole party and the whole people vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, it is not enough to merely be satisfied with "repairing items as they come." The experience of some factories has proven that if we change the phenomenon of "waiting for goods to arrive," take the initiative to go out of the factory and delve into the front lines of agricultural production to investigate and understand the types, quantities, priorities, and urgencies of farm tools that need repair and assembly, and then, in the spirit of "staying ahead of the farming season," prepare accessories one season in advance and plan "door-to-door repair and assembly," this will win even greater praise from the broad masses of farmers. Doing so can more proactively support agriculture, allowing farmers to have sufficient tools before the production season, and in the process of "door-to-door repair and assembly," teach farmers how to use them and impart repair and assembly techniques. At the same time, farmers do not need to travel to deliver farm tools, saving manpower and time for the countryside. Doing so can also enable factories to better arrange their own production, uniformly organize labor, and prepare raw materials and other materials in advance, so as to complete the task of farm tool repair and assembly on the premise of saving manpower and materials.

When carrying out the above work, all factories and mining enterprises must pay special attention to the production of accessories for agricultural machinery and new-style farm tools. Only with a sufficient number of accessories can the existing agricultural machinery and new-style farm tools immediately play their role. Any ideas that neglect the production of accessories must be resolutely corrected. In addition, to carry out the repair and assembly of farm tools in a planned way, it is necessary to arrange it early. The standard for this "early" is to complete the repair and assembly of farm tools one season in advance according to the farming season. Only in this way can we truly stay ahead of the farming season.

    计划修配  上门修配
    进一步做好农具修配工作是当前工业支援农业的一项重要任务。所谓进一步做好，重要的一条就是要变“等货上门”为“上门修配”，把“计划修配”和“随到随修”结合起来，使农具修配工作更加适应大办农业、大办粮食新形势的需要。
    自从党中央发出全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的伟大号召以来，不光是直接为农业生产服务的农业机械修造厂做到了“农民送什么，我们修什么”，其他厂矿企业也踊跃接受农民送上门来的修配活。这是博得了广大农民的热烈称赞的。可是，根据全党全民大办农业、大办粮食这一新形势的要求，不能仅仅满足于“随到随修”。一些工厂的经验证明，如果改变“等货上门”的现象，主动走出工厂，深入农业生产第一线，调查了解需要修配的农具的品种、数量、先后、缓急，然后本着“赶在农事季节前面”的精神，提前一个季节，有准备有计划地生产配件，有计划地“上门修配”，这会更加博得广大农民赞扬。这样做，可以更加主动地支援农业，让农民在生产季节之前就有足够的工具，并在“上门修配”的过程中，教会农民使用，传授修配技术。同时，不用农民跑路送农具，替农村节省了人力和时间。这样做，还可以使工厂更好地安排自己的生产，统一组织劳力，事前做好原料材料等准备工作，在省人省料的前提下来完成农具修配任务。
    各个厂矿企业在进行上述工作的时候，特别要抓紧农业机械和新式农具的配件生产，只有有了足够数量的配件，才能使现有农业机械和新式农具马上发挥作用。任何忽视配件生产的思想，都是必须坚决纠正的。此外，要有计划地做好农具修配工作，必须提早安排。这个“早”的标准，就是按农事季节提前一季做好农具修配工作，只有如此，才能真正赶到农事季节前面。
