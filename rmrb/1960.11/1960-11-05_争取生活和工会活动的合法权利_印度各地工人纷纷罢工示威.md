Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from New Delhi: Workers in various parts of India have recently launched mass demonstrations and strikes to fight for work, improved treatment, and the legitimate rights to union activities.

According to the "Times of India," thousands of workers at the Seksaria factory in Mumbai held a demonstration on the 27th to protest the factory's closure. The demonstration was organized by the Mumbai Textile Workers' Union.

On October 25, approximately seven hundred workers in the textile department of the North Soomnugha Jute Mill near Chandernagore in West Bengal held a demonstration to protest the dismissal of seventeen workers by the management. According to the "Statesman," the management resorted to the brutal measure of dismissing workers due to an earlier dispute between the management and the workers over wage payments.

According to the "Hindustan Standard," thousands of dockworkers in Calcutta held a demonstration in front of the Labour Bureau office on October 25, demanding improved treatment and submitting a memorandum including twelve demands to the Labour Commissioner. The workers announced that if these demands for improved treatment were not met, they would demand the revocation of the ordinance prohibiting strikes in docks and ports in order to take direct action.

According to the "Indian Express," the Northern Railwaymen's Union of India, which has 45,000 members, filed a petition with the Delhi Circuit Court accusing the railway authorities of opposing the railway authorities' order to withdraw recognition of the union. The railway authorities revoked recognition of the union in order to suppress the workers after the general strike of government employees in July of this year.

    争取生活和工会活动的合法权利
    印度各地工人纷纷罢工示威
    新华社4日讯　新德里消息：印度各地工人最近纷纷举行群众示威和罢工，为争取工作、改善待遇和工会活动的合法权利而斗争。
    据“印度时报”报道，孟买塞克萨里亚工厂的几千名工人27日举行示威，抗议关闭工厂。这次示威是由孟买纺织工人工会组织的。
    10月25日，西孟加拉邦昌德那加尔附近的北舒姆努加黄麻厂纺织部的大约七百名工人举行示威，抗议资方解雇十七名工人。据“政治家报”报道，由于资方和工人之间早些时候在支付工资问题上发生了争执，资方就采取解雇工人的横暴手段。
    据“印度斯坦旗报”报道，加尔各答的几千名码头工人10月25日曾经在劳工局办事处前面举行示威，要求改善待遇，并向劳工局长提交一项包括十二点要求的备忘录。工人宣布，如果这些改善待遇的要求得不到满足，他们将要求撤销在码头和港口禁止罢工的法令，以便采取直接行动。
    据“印度快报”报道，拥有四万五千名会员的印度北方铁路工人工会向德里巡回法庭提出控告铁路当局的请愿书，反对铁路当局撤销对工会的承认的命令。铁路当局在今年7月政府雇员总罢工以后，为了镇压工人，撤销了对这个工会的承认。
