Reasonable Output Increases Daily Due to Production Quotas

    The location of our commune's Macha Production Team is in a mountainous area, with a wide range of sideline production avenues. The entire team has ten sideline production activities that can be started immediately, such as charcoal burning, medicinal herb digging, and weaving. However, in the past, these productions did not have unified production quotas and payment methods. In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members, the Party branch launched discussions among the masses to formulate quotas and payment methods. Then, the Party branch summarized and formulated production quotas and work-point recording and payment methods.

    Each major sideline production category here has many sub-items. If work points were recorded according to the quantity of production, the numerous items would be difficult to specify one by one. The production team adopted a method of recording work points based on the value of the product. For example, digging five jiao worth of medicinal herbs earns one work point, weaving one yuan worth of baskets earns one work point, and so on. This work-point recording method fully considered the specific circumstances of each production activity and made unified balance. Each group can complete the production quota with effort. At the same time, a reward and punishment system was formulated. Settlements are made monthly, achieving timely payment and timely rewards and punishments. After the implementation of this system, it further stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the commune members, and sideline production rapidly developed. The total value of various sideline productions of the entire team increased from 140 yuan per day to 420 yuan.

    定额合理产量日增
    我们公社麻岔生产队所在地是个山区，副业生产的门路很广，全队有烧木炭、挖药材、编织等十项副业可以立即开始生产。但是，这些生产在过去没有统一的生产定额和付酬办法。党支部为了调动社员劳动积极性，就发动群众讨论制订定额和付酬办法。然后党支部归纳起来制订了生产定额和记工付酬办法。
    这里的副业生产每一大项中又有很多小项，如果按生产的数量记工，项目繁多难以逐项规定，生产队就采取了折款记工的办法。如每刨价值五角钱的药材记工分一个，每编织价值一元的筐篓记工分一个等等。这种记工办法，充分考虑了各项生产的具体情况，并做了统一平衡，每个小组经过努力都能完成生产定额，同时又制订了奖罚制度。每月一结算，做到及时付酬、及时奖罚。这项制度贯彻执行以后，进一步激发了社员的劳动积极性，副业生产迅速地开展起来，全队各项副业产值由每日一百四十元提高到四百二十元。
