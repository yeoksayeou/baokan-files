　　Grasping Life Must Also Be Solid and Down-to-Earth

　　In the midst of the vigorous increase production and practice economy campaign, we published the news of the Benxi Coal Mine implementing meal delivery underground. The purpose was to awaken the leading cadres of various factories and mines to pay attention to grasping the lives of employees while vigorously grasping production, especially when the enthusiasm of the masses of employees for production is greater, the more they should care about the lives of the masses. Grasping life is not just about eating, clothing, and daily necessities, but it is related to the production enthusiasm and political enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees.

　　Grasping life, like grasping production, requires solving problems practically. Grasping life means earnestly solving the specific problems that the masses of employees urgently need to solve, and it must be carried through to the end, not just a general call. Life itself is very specific and trivial, and the masses have to live every day, eat, dress, and rest every day. If we do not grasp the specific and major problems, or if we grasp them for a while and then let go, we will certainly not be able to truly arrange the lives of the masses well. Many of our factories and mines, during the high tide of the production movement, organized activities such as delivering meals to underground, delivering meals to the furnace front, and providing services to the door, but after some time, some of them returned to their old ways. This will not be conducive to consolidating the production enthusiasm of the masses. We must persist in those good methods that can truly solve life problems and consolidate them with systems.

　　Arranging the lives of the masses is a very meticulous task. The scope is wide and there are many things to do. Therefore, we must distinguish between primary and secondary tasks. What can be done today must not be postponed until tomorrow, and what cannot be done today must be clearly explained to the masses. We should educate the masses to establish and carry forward the ideas of hard work, plain living, and building the country through diligence and thrift. The increase production and practice economy campaign on the industrial front is surging higher and higher. While vigorously grasping production, earnestly grasping the lives of employees will further stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the masses and push the increase production and practice economy campaign to a new climax!

### 抓生活也要扎扎实实

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    抓生活也要扎扎实实
    在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，我们发表本溪煤矿实行井下送饭的消息，其目的是要唤起各厂矿企业的领导干部注意，在大抓生产的同时，也要大抓职工生活，特别是当职工群众生产劲头越大的时候，越要关心群众生活。抓生活不仅是吃饭问题、穿衣问题、油盐酱醋问题，而是关系到广大职工群众的生产热情和政治热情的问题。
    抓生活也和抓生产一样，要切切实实地解决问题。抓生活就要切实解决职工群众生活中迫切需要解决的具体问题，而且要一抓到底，不能只是一般号召。生活本身就是很具体很琐碎的，而且群众天天都要生活，天天都要吃、穿、休息，如果不抓住具体的而又是主要的问题，或者抓一阵放一阵，一定不会真正把群众生活安排好。我们许多厂矿企业，在生产运动的高潮中，都曾组织过送饭到井下、送饭到炉前、服务到门等活动，可是过些日子，有的又恢复了老样子。这样会不利于巩固群众的生产积极性。必须把那些真正能解决生活问题的好办法坚持下去，用制度巩固下来。
    安排群众生活是一项相当细致的工作。方面广，事情多，因此要分别主次，今天能办到的决不推到明天，今天办不到的，一定要向群众说清楚。应该教育群众树立和发扬艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的思想。工业战线上的增产节约运动正在逐浪高涨。在狠抓生产的同时，切实抓好职工生活，就能更加激发群众的劳动热情，把增产节约运动推向新的高潮！ 　（摘自《辽宁日报》）
