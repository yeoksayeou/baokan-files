    Happily Returning to the Countryside
    Liu Hongzhi, Family Member of a Worker at the Jiaoghe County Agricultural Technology School

    I am a family member of a worker at the Jiaoghe County Agricultural Technology School, Hebei Province. I grew up in the countryside and participated in labor after graduating from junior high school. Since getting married, I have followed my husband and become a family member. For the past few years, my life as a family member has consisted of cooking and taking care of the children; every day, besides talking about food and clothing, there was nothing else to do.

    Recently, by attending meetings and studying the newspaper, I understood the important significance of the Party's proposal to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production. I deeply feel that the Party's measures to strengthen the front line of agricultural production are extremely wise. Every day, I am very excited when I see these news items in the newspaper, but they also stirred up many struggles within me. I thought about signing up to participate in agricultural production and going to the front line, but then I considered what to do about the children and the elderly. When I thought about what if nobody had children and elderly, and everyone were unwilling to participate in agricultural production, where would the grain come from? Where would the industrial raw materials come from? What would happen to the country's construction...? Especially after I read the heroic deeds of the "Iron Girls" and "Xing Yanzi" who were determined to change the face of the countryside, it gave me even more courage. I am a member of the Communist Youth League; if they can do it, why can't I? I should respond to the Party's call and step forward to the front line of agriculture. Thinking of this, I resolutely signed up. With the approval of the leadership, I have already moved to a glorious position, settling down in the Wangsanying Production Team of the Nanpi Commune in Jiaoghe County. Although it feels a little tiring at the beginning, I know that the cause I am engaged in is extremely glorious and great. Every time I think of this, I am full of energy. I have made up my mind to make contributions to the vigorous development of agriculture.

    心情愉快回农村
    交河县农业技术学校职工家属　刘洪志
    我是河北省交河县农业技术学校的职工家属，自小就在农村，高小毕业以后，在农村参加劳动。自从结了婚就跟丈夫出来当家属。几年来的家属生活总是做饭、看孩子；每天除了讲吃说穿，也没有什么别的事情干。
    最近，通过参加会议和学习报纸，我懂得了党提出大办农业，大办粮食的重要意义。我深深感到党采取加强农业生产第一线的措施是十分英明的。每天我看到报纸上这些消息都非常激动，但是也引起我内心里许多斗争。我想报名参加农业生产，到第一线上去，可是我又考虑孩子、老人怎么办？当我想到谁没有孩子和老人，都因为这不愿参加农业生产，粮食从哪里来？工业原料从哪里来？国家的建设怎么办……。特别是当我看了“铁姑娘”、“邢燕子”发愤图强，改变农村面貌的英雄事迹以后，更加鼓起了勇气。我是个共青团员，她们办得到的事情，我为什么办不到。我应该响应党的号召，挺身而出到农业第一线去。想到这里，我毅然决然地报了名，经领导批准，我已经走向光荣的岗位，在交河县南皮公社王三营生产队安家落户，尽管开头觉得累一些，但是我知道我所干的事业是极其光荣伟大的事业。每逢想到这里我便浑身是劲。我已经下了决心，一定要为大办农业立功。
