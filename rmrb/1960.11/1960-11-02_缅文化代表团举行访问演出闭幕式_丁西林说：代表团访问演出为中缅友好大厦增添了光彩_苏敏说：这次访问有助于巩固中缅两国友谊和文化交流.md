Colonel Su Min, head of the Burmese Cultural Delegation, said in his speech that he expressed his most sincere and heartfelt gratitude for the "Pauk Phaw" (fraternal) like, warm, and meticulous reception the delegation received in China. He said that the cultural ties between our two countries, like the waters of the Salween River and the Yangtze River, will flow forever; the cultural ships of our two countries are linked together just as the mountains and rivers of our two countries are connected. Colonel Su Min said that the common advocacy of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence by the leaders of our two countries has further strengthened the ties between our two countries. He said that cultural exchange is one of the effective ways to realize the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

In front of the Huabiao and the Independence Tower, Burmese singers sang "The Song of Burmese-Chinese Friendship" and "The Song of Chinese-Burmese Friendship" in both Chinese and Burmese. Their touching songs, "The Chinese-Burmese border is connected to the border, we are both friends and relatives" and "Chinese-Burmese friendship is like the water of the Nu River and the Salween River, harmonious,融洽(róng qià), and long-lasting," won warm applause from the audience again and again. Finally, the Burmese artists sang "The Sino-Burmese Border Treaty Song" together. The lyrics, "We are like brothers, loving and caring for each other, we shout that the Sino-Burmese Border Treaty has been successfully signed," sang out the common aspirations of the people of China and Burma, and the audience responded to their performance with a long applause.
