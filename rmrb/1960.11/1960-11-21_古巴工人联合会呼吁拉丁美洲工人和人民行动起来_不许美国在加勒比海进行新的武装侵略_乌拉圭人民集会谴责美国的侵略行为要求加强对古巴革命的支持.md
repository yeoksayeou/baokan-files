Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 19th. The Cuban Workers' Confederation issued a statement today calling on all workers and peoples of Latin America to mobilize militantly against the new acts of military aggression by U.S. imperialism in dispatching aircraft and fleets to the Caribbean region to suppress the struggles of the people of Guatemala and Nicaragua.

The statement pointed out that the dispatch of U.S. troops is to aid tyranny, suppress insurgent forces, safeguard the interests of U.S. monopoly groups, intimidate the Latin American people, and seek an excuse for a pre-planned armed aggression against Cuba. The statement emphasized that "In the face of the alliance of the worst elements remaining in the Americas, workers and people must unite strongly, continue to support the cause of freedom in Guatemala and Nicaragua, and condemn the common enemy of the Latin American working class and the oppressed classes – U.S. imperialism."

The statement said, "The Cuban working class strongly condemns the new aggression that attempts to obstruct the people from deciding their own destiny." It said, "Cuban workers have decided to declare one day as a day for all trade unions to express our condemnation of the activities of tyranny in Latin America and its Wall Street masters. We will also hold activities to support the American workers and people who are struggling for the right to control their own destiny."

The Cuban people continue to protest against U.S. imperialist interference in the affairs of Guatemala and Nicaragua. Militiamen from the Almancio Rodriguez sugar mill, workers from the maternal and sanitary supplies factory, and fishermen from the Florida Beach cooperative have all published protest statements in the newspapers today.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 18th. Cuban public opinion continues to unanimously and indignantly condemn the serious military provocation of the United States deploying troops in the Caribbean.

Today's commentary in "Calle" condemned the U.S. government's action of sending Marines, stating that it demonstrated "the United States is at war with the peoples of the Americas." The newspaper said, "The United States is so afraid of the widespread struggle against imperialism that it will henceforth abandon its mask and act openly. It will defend exploitation and attack the people of all countries." The commentary said, "The coming years will be difficult for the people of Latin America. Imperialism will brutally and fiercely take swift action to attack any attempt to distribute land, limit American interests, and take action freely and autonomously. The incorrigible U.S. imperialism will become increasingly violent and commit more and more crimes."

The newspaper emphasized that "the moment for a decisive struggle against imperialism throughout the continent is approaching." The commentary said that in the face of harsh reality, it is not feasible to rely on international organizations. "Although the struggle must continue within these organizations, it is clear that the people of Latin America should rely on their own courage and heroism to achieve the benefits of their economic freedom. The United States is today's new type of fascism. Monopoly groups directly manipulate the regime through the Pentagon, and their goals are the same as those of fascism and Nazism: to live a life of luxury at the expense of the interests of other parts of the world. Their actions are also the same: using force. Faced with this situation, our strength lies in courage and taking up arms."

The "Revolución" newspaper commented, "The dark history of U.S. imperialism is filled with attacks on the dignity and patriotism of our people, and now it once again proves that we will only have peace when imperialism is eliminated." The newspaper pointed out, "The anger felt by all Latin Americans is now beyond words." In expressing the Cuban people's support for the struggle of the people of Guatemala and Nicaragua, the newspaper said, "Their struggle is our struggle, and likewise, our struggle is their struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, November 20th. Montevideo dispatch: Workers, students, and people in Uruguay held rallies in various cities and factories, strongly condemning the U.S. deployment of troops in the Caribbean to threaten Cuba by force, and calling for strengthening support for the Cuban revolution. Uruguayan workers are closely watching the development of the situation and are prepared to take immediate measures in the event that the United States launches an attack on Cuba.

Some Uruguayan newspapers also criticized the new U.S. aggression. "El Popular" published an article entitled "The United States Extends its Claws to Support Dictators," saying, "The U.S. State Department is brandishing a big stick, intensifying the threat of direct military aggression against Cuba. Under these circumstances, the entire Latin America has stood up, raised its combat vigilance, and is prepared to go all out to defend this close sister country."

The article said, "Cuba is not isolated. In addition to the rock-solid determination of the Cuban people and the combat support of the Latin American people, there is also the support of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, which have clearly warned the U.S. imperialists that any attempt to invade Cuba will not go unpunished."

The weekly "Adelante" published an editorial saying: "In this incident, neither the U.S. government nor its 'friendly' allies have been able to uncover any specific facts about Castro's interference as a pretext for its patrols (near Cuban waters)."

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, November 18th. The U.S. President's order to dispatch the navy "to prevent aggression against Guatemala and Nicaragua" has aroused great indignation among the democratic classes of Venezuela. "Tribuna Popular" used the headline "Aggression Against the People of Guatemala and Nicaragua" when publishing this news.

The newspaper called on Venezuelans to be vigilant and prepared to defend the Cuban revolution, which is the aim of this U.S. mobilization.

Xinhua News Agency, November 19th. According to TASS, Mexico City: The "Novedades de México" published on the 19th a statement by the Guatemalan Patriotic Union on the situation in Guatemala, exposing the United States' use of Guatemala against the Cuban people.

The statement said that the Guatemalan Ydígoras Fuentes group does not represent the interests of the people of our motherland. This group places the interests of North American monopoly capital above national interests. The Ydígoras government has maintained a powerful state machine to suppress the people and to maintain its regime.

The statement pointed out that the Guatemalan people live in poverty and terror. That is why the people are forced to express their protest by all means.

The statement revealed that Ydígoras's accusation that Cuba interfered in Guatemalan affairs "is to prepare the conditions for North American imperialism to invade the Cuban people."

The statement strongly condemned the United States' decision to give Guatemala military "aid."

The statement concluded by pointing out that Ydígoras Fuentes is a dangerous provocateur in the Caribbean.

This Guatemalan Patriotic Union in Mexico is a political organization that unites democratic people inside and outside Guatemala. (Attached picture)

    古巴工人联合会呼吁拉丁美洲工人和人民行动起来
    不许美国在加勒比海进行新的武装侵略
    乌拉圭人民集会谴责美国的侵略行为要求加强对古巴革命的支持
    新华社哈瓦那19日电　古巴工人联合会今天发表声明，呼吁拉丁美洲所有的工人和人民战斗性地动员起来，反对美帝国主义为镇压危地马拉和尼加拉瓜人民的斗争而向加勒比海地区派遣飞机和舰队的新的军事侵略行为。
    声明指出，派遣美国军队是为了援助暴政，镇压起义力量，维护美国垄断集团的利益，恫吓拉丁美洲人民，并为已经策划好的武装侵略古巴寻找口实。声明强调说，“面对着美洲残存的最坏成分的联盟，工人和人民必须坚强地团结起来，继续支持危地马拉和尼加拉瓜争取自由的事业，谴责拉丁美洲工人阶级和被压迫阶级的共同敌人——美帝国主义。”
    声明说，“古巴工人阶级强烈地谴责企图阻挠人民决定自己命运的新的侵略”。它说，“古巴工人决定宣布一天为所有工会表示我们谴责拉丁美洲的暴政及其华尔街主子的活动日。我们也将举行支持为争取掌握自己命运的权利而斗争的美洲工人和人民的活动。”
    古巴人民群众继续抗议美帝国主义对危地马拉和尼加拉瓜人民的干涉。阿尔曼西奥·罗德里格斯糖厂的民兵，母亲用品和卫生用品工厂的工人以及佛罗里达海滩合作社的渔民今天都在报上发表了抗议声明。
    据新华社哈瓦那18日电　古巴舆论继续义愤填膺地一致谴责美国陈兵加勒比海的严重军事挑衅。
    “街道报”今天的评论谴责美国政府派遣海军陆战队的行动表明了“美国在与美洲各国人民为敌。”这家报纸说，“美国对反对帝国主义的普遍斗争感到非常害怕，以至从今以后将抛开假面具进行活动。它将维护剥削，攻击所有国家的人民。”评论说，“今后的几年对拉丁美洲人民来说将是艰苦的，帝国主义将残暴地、凶狠地采取迅速行动来攻击一切企图分配土地、限制美国利益以及自由和自主地采取行动的意图。执迷不悟的美帝国主义将日益凶暴，日益犯下更多的罪行。”
    这家报纸强调指出，“在全大陆范围内展开反对帝国主义的殊死斗争的时刻临近了。”评论说，在冷酷的现实面前，想依靠国际组织是不行的。“虽然必须继续在这些组织内进行斗争，但是，显然，拉丁美洲各国人民应该依靠他们自己的勇气和英雄主义来取得他们经济自由的利益。美国是今天的新型的法西斯主义。垄断集团通过五角大楼直接操纵着政权，它们的目的与法西斯主义和纳粹的目的一样：牺牲世界上其他各地的利益来过优裕的生活。它们的行为也是一样的：使用武力。面对这种情况，我们的力量也就是勇敢与拿起武器。”
      “前进报”评论说，“美帝国主义的黑暗的历史充满了对我们各国人民的尊严和爱国主义的攻击，现在它再一次证明，只有消灭了帝国主义我们才会有和平。”报纸指出，“现在全体拉丁美洲人感到的愤怒是言语所不能表达的。”报纸在表示古巴人民支持危地马拉和尼加拉瓜人民的斗争时说，“他们的斗争就是我们的斗争，同样，我们的斗争也就是他们的斗争。”
    新华社20日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭的工人、学生和人民分别在各市区和工厂举行集会，强烈谴责美国陈兵加勒比海武装威胁古巴，号召加强对古巴革命的支持。乌拉圭工人们正在密切注视着局势的发展，准备在一旦美国发动对古巴的进攻时，立即采取措施。
    乌拉圭的一些报纸也抨击美国的新侵略行动。“人民报”以“美国伸出魔爪支持独裁者”为题发表文章说，“美国国务院高举着大棒，加剧了对古巴进行直接的军事侵略的威胁。在这种情况下，整个拉丁美洲都挺身而出，提高了战斗警惕性，准备全力以赴地保卫这个亲密的姊妹国家。”
    文章说，“古巴不是孤立的。除了古巴人民磐石般的坚定性和拉丁美洲人民的战斗支援外，还有苏联和社会主义国家的支援，这些国家已经明确地警告美帝国主义者，侵略古巴的任何企图都不能逍遥法外。”
    “前进”周刊发表社论说：“在这次事件中，无论是美国政府，还是它的‘友好’盟邦都未能揭发出来任何关于卡斯特罗干涉的具体事实作为它（在古巴附近海面）进行巡逻的口实。”
    新华社加拉加斯18日电　美国总统下令派遣海军“去防止对危地马拉和尼加拉瓜的侵略”一事激起了委内瑞拉民主阶层的极大愤慨。“人民论坛报”在发表这条消息时所用的标题是“对危地马拉和尼加拉瓜人民的侵略”。
    这家报纸要求委内瑞拉人警惕起来，准备好保卫古巴革命，古巴革命是美国这次动员的目的。
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社墨西哥城讯：墨西哥城“新闻日报”19日刊登了危地马拉爱国联盟就危地马拉局势发表的一个声明，揭露美国利用危地马拉来反对古巴人民。
    声明说，危地马拉伊迪戈拉斯·富恩特斯集团并不代表我们祖国人民的利益。这个集团把北美垄断资本的利益置于民族利益之上。伊迪戈拉斯政府一直保持着强大的国家机器来镇压人民和借以维持其政权。
    声明指出，危地马拉人民生活在贫困和恐怖之中。这就是为什么人民被迫用一切手段来表示抗议。
    声明揭露说，伊迪戈拉斯指控古巴干涉危地马拉事务的“目的是为北美帝国主义侵略古巴人民准备好条件”。
    声明强烈谴责美国决定给危地马拉军事“援助”。
    声明最后指出，伊迪戈拉斯·富恩特斯是在加勒比海的危险的挑衅者。
    这个在墨西哥的危地马拉爱国联盟是团结危地马拉国内外民主人士的政治组织。（附图片）
