    Hu Kungi, an Expert in Conserving Firewood
    Hu Kungi, the cook of the No. 9 Production Team's public canteen in Julong People's Commune, Yanting County, Sichuan, assiduously studied and improved the stove design and firewood burning methods. In one hour, he can cook rice for 103 people, stir-fry 58 jin of vegetables and a pot of broad beans, boil a pot of pig feed, and boil a pot of water, all while burning only 51.54 jin of firewood.
    The firewood used by this canteen has to be collected from a place 25 li away, occupying more than 20 laborers. In order to save firewood, Hu Kungi thought hard day and night, inquired about advanced experiences from others, and actively studied with the production team's Party and Youth League members and cadres, finally figuring out a set of methods for saving firewood. His methods are: 1. The fire must burn continuously, not sometimes fierce and sometimes weak, or burning and extinguishing. 2. Add firewood at appropriate times, adding it frequently and in small amounts. 3. Burn loose firewood, not tight bundles. 4. Where fierce fire is needed, throw the firewood there, don't scatter the firepower. 5. People should be meticulous, and the fire should have an empty center; when burning firewood, stir and pick it frequently. Yang Zongquan

    节约烧柴能手胡坤贵
    四川盐亭县巨龙人民公社第九生产队公共食堂的炊事员胡坤贵，刻苦钻研，改进灶型和烧柴的办法，在一个小时内他能煮熟一百零三个人的饭，炒五十八斤菜和一锅蚕豆，熬一锅猪食，还烧一锅开水，总共只烧柴五十一点五四斤。
    这个食堂用的烧柴，要到二十五里远的地方去拾，占用劳动力二十多人。胡坤贵为节约烧柴日夜苦思，四处打听别人的先进经验，并主动和生产队的党、团员、干部研究，终于摸索到了一套节约烧柴的办法。他的办法是：一、火要一个劲的烧，不要时猛时微，一燃一熄。二、适时进柴，勤进少进。三、要烧散柴，不要烧死把子。四、哪里需要猛火，就把柴掷向那里，不要分散火力。五、人要精心、火要空心；烧柴时要勤拨勤挑。杨宗铨
