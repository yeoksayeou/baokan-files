Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai.  Dai Daolong, a Communist Party member and youth technician from a worker background at the Shanghai Synthetic Fragrance Factory, with the indomitable spirit of "one is not a hero unless he reaches the Great Wall," and with the help of his comrades, made 360 experiments in a year and a half, finally creating a simple method for manufacturing synthetic anisyl alcohol. In November, they began mass-producing synthetic anisyl alcohol using this new method, and the product quality fully meets the requirements.

Synthetic anisyl alcohol is one of the important raw materials for the production of medicine, food, and cosmetics. In the past, China extracted it from anise oil from plants and could not produce it by chemical synthesis. After the start of the Great Leap Forward, Dai Daolong saw that the production of anisyl alcohol could not meet the needs of all parties due to the limitation of raw materials, and he was very anxious, thinking that he must find a way in synthesis. Just at this time, the Shanghai Synthetic Fragrance Factory received the task of experimenting with synthetic anisyl alcohol, and Dai Daolong participated in this work.

According to the requirements of the old data, a set of acid-resistant rare metal reaction pots and advanced glass instruments and equipment were required for production. This factory did not have such equipment. Dai Daolong proposed to break through the old methods and come up with new methods. The Party Branch Secretary supported his opinion and said to him: "We should establish the concept of 'the less we ask from the state, the better, and the more contributions we make to the state, the better,' and we must spend less money and do more things." Dai Daolong, together with engineer Tu Bofan, workers Dai Daonian, Cao Lianxi, Le Xiuyun and others, discussed and decided to use other materials to replace the acid-resistant rare metals. He and Dai Daonian rode bicycles and ran more than thirty shops and flea markets, found the required substitute materials, and spent only a few tens of yuan to create a simple but practical indigenous equipment. At first, what they made was not fragrance, but a black and useless compound. After 95 experiments, it was still the same. Dai Daolong consulted engineers and technicians, ran to Xinhua Bookstore, and looked at fragrance manuals and organic chemistry books, but could not find a way to solve this problem. Dai Daolong believed that he could no longer copy the old calendars, he must blaze a new trail, so he reconsidered the formula and process route. They lined up the conditions for each reaction process, and after careful analysis, found the four links that were most likely to produce this useless compound, and then used the method of "exploring step by step, finding contradictions, accumulating data, drawing conclusions, and breaking through levels" to experiment more than 150 times before and after, and finally initially explored the law of manufacturing synthetic anisyl alcohol, and could produce a small amount of synthetic anisyl alcohol with new processes and new formulas.

Although a small amount of synthetic anisyl alcohol could be produced, Dai Daolong was not satisfied. He must find a faster, better and more economical process route in terms of output and quality. He and his comrades, regardless of day or night, wind or rain, always rode their bicycles to other factories to learn. In more than half a year, he and his comrades ran more than thirty factories in the fragrance, chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries, concentrated the relevant new processes and technologies of these factories, applied them to their own production, and changed the manual operation part to mechanization, and further experimented more than forty times, resulting in a great shortening of the reaction time, and found a road for mass production.

Now he is still continuing to improve, so that the manufacturing method of synthetic anisyl alcohol is more perfect.

    决心填补香料工业空白不屈不挠战胜重重困难
    戴道龙等用合成方法制成茴香醇
    新华社上海电　上海综合香料厂共产党员、工人出身的青年技术员戴道龙，以不到长城非好汉的顽强精神，在同志们的帮助下，一年半作了三百六十次试验，终于创造成功一种简便的制造合成茴香醇的办法。11月份，他们已用这种新办法开始成批生产合成茴香醇，产品质量完全符合要求。
    合成茴香醇是医药、食品、化妆品生产上的重要原料之一。过去，我国是从植物茴香油中提炼，不会用化学合成办法生产。大跃进开始后，戴道龙看到茴香醇的生产由于受原料的限制，不能满足各方面的需要，心里很急，想到一定要在合成方面想办法才行。刚好这时候，上海综合香料厂接到试验合成茴香醇的任务，戴道龙就参加了这项工作。
    按照老资料的要求，必须有一套耐酸的稀有金属反应锅和高级玻璃仪器设备才能生产。这个厂没有这样的设备。戴道龙就提出要突破老办法，想出新办法来。党支部书记支持他的意见，对他说：“我们应该树立‘向国家要的愈少愈好，为国家作出的贡献愈多愈好’的观念，一定要少花钱多办事。”戴道龙就和工程师屠伯范，工人戴道年、曹连喜、乐秀云等七人一起商量，决定用别的材料来代替耐酸的稀有金属。他和戴道年骑了自行车，跑了三十多家商店和旧货摊，找到了需要的代用材料，只花了几十块钱，就搞出了一套简陋而又实用的土设备。起初做出来的不是香料，而是一种乌黑的没用的化合物，一直试验了九十五次，还是这样。戴道龙请教工程师、技术员，跑新华书店，看香料手册、有机化学书籍，都没有找到解决这个问题的途径。戴道龙认为不能再抄老皇历了，一定要闯出一条新路来，于是重新考虑配方和工艺路线。他们把原来每一个反应过程所具备的条件都排了队，经过细致的分析，找出了最容易出这种无用化合物的四个环节，然后运用“步步摸索、找出矛盾、积累资料、得出规律、关关突破”的方法，前后又试验了一百五十多次，终于初步摸索到制造合成茴香醇的规律，用新工艺、新配方能生产出少量合成茴香醇。
    虽然合成茴香醇可以少量生产了，但是戴道龙并不满足，他一定要在产量、质量等方面，找出一条更加多快好省的工艺路线来。他和同志们一起，不管白天黑夜，风吹雨打，总是骑着自行车到外厂去学习。在半年多时间里，他和同志们跑了香料、化工、医药、食品等行业的三十多家工厂，把这些厂的有关新工艺新技术集中起来，运用到自己的生产上，又把手工操作部分改为机械化，进一步试验了四十多次，结果使反应时间大大缩短，找到了一条大量生产的道路。
    现在他还在继续改进，使合成茴香醇的制造方法更加完善。
