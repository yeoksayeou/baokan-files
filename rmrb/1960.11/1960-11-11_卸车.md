Unloading

    Early in the morning, more than twenty family members of employees excitedly rushed to the Bajiazi Ore Storage Yard of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Transportation Department. As soon as they arrived, they surrounded Tang Zaimin, the Party Branch Secretary of the loading and unloading team.
      "Secretary Tang, please assign us tasks quickly. We also want to contribute to increasing steel production."
    Secretary Tang asked them to sit down and explained, "Arranging the lives of employees is also very important. When their lives are well arranged, they can participate in production without any worries, which is supporting steel production."
    Secretary Tang's words made sense, but the employees' family members' reasoning was even more convincing: "Wouldn't it be even better if we both arrange our lives and directly support steelmaking?"
    Secretary Tang had no choice but to agree to their request. So, a temporary nursery was set up in the office, and Zhang Peiqiu volunteered to be the temporary nanny. A women's unloading team immediately went to the site.
    At five o'clock in the afternoon, after the work was finished, Secretary Tang announced: "The family members' production shock brigade worked quickly and well, exceeding the unloading task..." Before Secretary Tang could finish speaking, gongs and drums sounded, and the workers presented a big-character poster to the employees' family members, congratulating them. They also expressed that they would continue to exert their energy and, while arranging their lives well, take time to participate in production again.

    卸车
    清晨，二十多名职工家属兴冲冲地奔向鞍山钢铁公司运输部八家子储矿场。一到现场，她们就把装卸队党支部书记唐再民给围上了。
      “唐书记，有什么任务就快点分配吧，咱们也要为多产钢贡献一点力量。”
    唐书记一面给大家让坐，一面解释：“安排好职工生活也很重要，生活安排好了，让职工一心无挂地参加生产，就是支援钢铁生产。”
    唐书记的话是很有道理的，可是职工家属们的道理更有说服力：“我们既安排好生活，又直接支援炼钢，这不更好吗？”
    唐书记没有办法，只好答应了她们的要求。于是，办公室里组成了临时托儿所，张佩秋主动当了临时保育员，一支妇女装卸队就立即开赴现场了。
    下午五点，劳动结束了，唐书记宣布：“家属生产突击队干的又快又好，超额完成了卸车任务……”唐书记的话还没说完，锣鼓响起来了，工人们把一张大字报送给了职工家属们，向她们祝贺；她们也表示要继续鼓足干劲，在安排好生活的同时，再抽时间来参加生产。
