    The Chairman of the People's Comrade Party of Burma, Bo Bo Khin, a member of the Presidium of the Burma National United Front, said in Rangoon after returning from a recent visit to China that China, which is working hard in all aspects of socialist construction, naturally hopes for world peace. This is "to ensure the success and progress of their ongoing construction work and achieve solid and stable results."

    He said that it is natural for a country that hopes for peace to be willing to live in friendship with all countries in the world. He also said that the People's Republic of China has successfully concluded a treaty of friendship and a boundary treaty with the Union of Burma. The People's Republic of China is continuing its efforts to resolve border issues with other neighboring countries.

    In an interview with a Xinhua News Agency reporter, Bo Bo Khin praised the enthusiasm and achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction. He said that the country's construction work is constantly being carried out with the support of the masses. "I have personally witnessed how their socialist construction's Great Leap Forward and people's communes continue to achieve success on the basis of the power of the masses."

    Bo Bo Khin also praised the Chinese people's perseverance in their work and their simple spirit in terms of food and clothing. He said, "The Chinese people are working diligently to enable all Chinese people to reach a high standard of living according to their short-term and long-term plans, which has greatly inspired me."

    Finally, Bo Bo Khin expressed his sincere gratitude to all Chinese "Pauk Phaws" for the warm hospitality he received from the Chinese people during his stay in China.

    缅甸人民同志党主席说
    中国发愤建设希望和平
    最近访问中国后回国的缅甸民族团结阵线主席团委员、人民同志党主席波波昆在仰光说，在社会主义建设各个方面正在发愤努力的中国，自然是希望世界和平的。这样是“为了使他们正在进行的建设工作取得成功和进展，取得结实和稳固的成效。”
    他说，一个希望和平的国家愿意同世界各国友好相处，那是很自然的。他又说，中华人民共和国已经顺利地同缅甸联邦缔结友好条约和边界条约。中华人民共和国正在继续努力解决同其他邻国的边界问题。
    波波昆在接见新华社记者时赞扬了中国人民在社会主义建设中表现出来的热情和取得的成就。他说，国家的建设工作是在群众支持下不断地进行着的。“我亲眼见到，在群众的力量的基础上，他们的社会主义建设的大跃进和人民公社是怎样继续不断地取得成功的。”
    波波昆还赞扬了中国人民在工作中的坚持精神以及饮食衣着的简朴精神。他说，“中国人民根据他们的短期和长期计划，为了使全中国人民能够达到很高的生活水平而勤恳地工作，这使我得到很大的鼓舞。”
    最后，波波昆对在中国逗留期间受到中国人民的盛情款待，向所有中国“胞波”们表示诚挚的感谢。
