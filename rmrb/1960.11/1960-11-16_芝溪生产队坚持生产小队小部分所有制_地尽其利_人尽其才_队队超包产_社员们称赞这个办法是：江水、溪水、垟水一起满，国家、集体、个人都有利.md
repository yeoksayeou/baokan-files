(Reported by our newspaper from Hangzhou on November 15) The Zhixi Production Team of Chuanliao Commune in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the production teams. While ensuring the completion of the contracted production tasks, they actively encouraged the teams to make full use of the edges of fields and other idle land to plant more and harvest more. At the same time, they engaged in animal husbandry, forestry, and other sideline production. Over the past year, the production of each team has been excellent. The members praised this method as: River water, stream water, and field water all fill up; the state, the collective, and the individual all benefit.

Now, the entire team's late autumn crops have all been harvested. According to the yield entering the warehouse, all four teams in the entire team have exceeded production quotas. The teams have harvested more than 11,000 catties of various grains and more than 50,000 catties of vegetables by using the edges of fields, idle land in front of and behind houses, and land reclaimed for cultivation. Now, this team has changed from lacking 20,000 catties of grain last year to having a surplus of more than 30,000 catties; all four teams have surplus grain and cash reserves. The teams also engaged in animal husbandry, forestry, and other sideline production. This year, each team raised 20 pigs, more than 100 rabbits, and poultry. In terms of sideline production, a total of 31 types of operations were carried out, including making ramie rope, weaving straw sandals, digging medicinal herbs, collecting wild starch, and making aromatic oil. In addition to turning over a small portion of the income from operations beyond the contracted production tasks to the production team for unified distribution, the various production teams themselves extracted a small portion for public accumulation and added 411 small farm tools such as hoes, tea baskets, and sweet potato mats. The vast majority of the income was distributed to the members of the team. By the end of October, the average income per household was 37 yuan and 4 jiao. Among the 111 households in the entire team, 89 households had savings deposits.

Should production teams be allowed to engage in more production beyond completing their contracted production tasks? The Zhixi Production Team once had a heated debate about this. At that time, some people said that doing so was "having a foot in two boats," and people's minds would be unsettled. In order to reach a consensus, the Party branch organized all the cadres and members of the team to conduct free airing of views and debate. During the debate, members of the second team pointed out that their team had arranged for four elderly women to raise six pigs and 22 rabbits last year, accumulating more than 560 dan of manure alone, which reduced production costs and increased the yield of spring flowers. Female member Liu Qiuxing said: "There are dozens of small sideline occupations throughout the team, and it is impossible for the production team to arrange everything in detail. The team members meet every day, and even a small sideline occupation with an income of one fen can flexibly arrange labor to engage in it. If it is not operated by the team, it will be wasted." Everyone cited many facts to prove that adhering to the system of small-scale ownership by the production team, giving the team a certain degree of flexibility, can achieve making the best use of talent, making the best use of land, comprehensively developing production, and increasing the income of members.

After ideological understanding was improved, the Party branch immediately mobilized the members to discuss and, in accordance with the policies, delineated the scope of operations for the teams: On the premise of ensuring the completion of the "three guarantees" tasks, the teams could make full use of idle land such as field edges and corners to expand the planting of grain and other crops, and could engage in animal husbandry, forestry, and other sideline production. Regarding the arrangement of labor, during busy farming seasons, labor was concentrated on large-scale field production. During slack seasons, the teams vigorously engaged in operations beyond the contracted production tasks, and seized the gaps in production to organize shock work.

Due to the conscientious implementation of policies, the awareness of the team cadres and members was raised. When arranging production, each team first ensured the needs of the contracted production tasks. For example, shortly after transplanting late rice in continuous cropping, a pest infestation occurred. Each team immediately suspended the collection of medicinal herbs and wild plants and other sideline production, and concentrated a portion of the labor force to collect local pesticides. After more than a month of shock work, the entire team collected more than 2,300 catties of local pesticides, ensuring the continuous pest control needs of late rice in continuous cropping.

Now, all the late rice in the entire team has been harvested, and both main and sideline products have been harvested together. Each team has generally arranged 50% of the labor force for winter planting, and 35% of the labor force for accumulating fertilizer. Winter planting is fast and good. Each team has also arranged auxiliary labor to collect wild plants and engage in sideline production, making production more dynamic and colorful.

### 芝溪生产队坚持生产小队小部分所有制  地尽其利　人尽其才　队队超包产  社员们称赞这个办法是：江水、溪水、垟水一起满，国家、集体、个人都有利

    芝溪生产队坚持生产小队小部分所有制
    地尽其利　人尽其才　队队超包产
    社员们称赞这个办法是：江水、溪水、垟水一起满，国家、集体、个人都有利
    本报杭州15日电　浙江青田县船寮公社芝溪生产队，充分调动生产小队的积极性，在保证完成包产任务的前提下，积极鼓励小队充分利用田边地角和其他闲散土地，多种多收，同时经营牧业、林业和其他副业生产。一年来，各小队的生产都搞得很出色。社员们称赞这个办法是江水、溪水、垟水一起满，国家、集体、个人都有利。
    现在，全队晚秋作物已经全部收回，根据入仓产量计算，全队四个小队队队超产。各小队利用田头地角、屋前屋后闲散土地和开荒种植的地，已收获了各种粮食一万一千多斤，蔬菜五万多斤。现在，这个队已由去年缺粮二万斤，变为余粮三万多斤；四个小队队队有余粮，有现金储备。小队还经营了畜牧业、林业和其他副业生产。今年，每个小队都养了二十头猪、一百多只兔子和家禽。副业生产方面，共经营了打岩麻绳、编草鞋、挖药材、采集野生淀粉、制芳香油等三十一种。各个生产小队包产任务以外的经营收入，除了上缴了一小部分给生产队统一分配；小队自己提取了一小部分作公共积累，添置了锄头、茶箩、番薯帘等小农具四百十一件；收入的绝大部分，分配给本小队的社员，到10月底，平均每户收入三十七元四角。全队一百十一户社员中，八十九户有存款。
    要不要让生产小队在完成包产任务以外，再多搞一些生产？芝溪生产队曾经有过一番热烈的争论。当时有人说，这样干是脚踏两只船，人定心不定。为了取得一致的认识，党支部组织全队干部和社员开展鸣放辩论。在辩论中，第二小队社员提出：他们小队去年安排了四个老太太养了六头猪、二十二只兔子，光栏肥就积了五百六十多担，既降低了生产成本，又提高了春花产量。女社员柳秋杏说：“全队零零碎碎的小副业有几十种，生产队不可能件件细致安排。小队社员天天碰在一起，即使是一分钱收入的小副业，也可以灵活安排劳力来搞。要是不归小队经营，也就白白地丢掉了。”大家列举许多事实证明，坚持生产小队小部分所有制，给小队一定的机动权，这样能做到人尽其才，地尽其利，全面发展生产，增加社员收入。
    在思想认识提高以后，党支部立即发动社员讨论，按照政策，划分了小队的经营范围：小队在保证完成“三包”任务的前提下，可以充分利用田头、地角等闲散土地扩种粮食和其他作物，可以经营牧业、林业和其他副业生产；对劳动力的安排，农忙集中劳力搞大田生产，农闲大搞小队包产任务以外的经营，并且抓紧生产的间隙组织突击。
    由于认真执行政策，提高了小队干部和社员觉悟，各小队在安排生产时，都首先做到了保证包产任务的需要。如连作晚稻插秧后不久，发生虫害，各小队都立即将采集药材和野生植物等副业生产暂时停下来，集中一部分劳力采集土农药。经过一个多月的突击，全队共采集了土农药二千三百多斤，保证了连作晚稻连续治虫的需要。
    现在，全队晚稻已全部收好，而且做到主副产品一起收。各个小队大体上安排了50％的劳力进行冬种，35％的劳力积肥，冬种又快又好。各小队还安排了辅助劳力采集野生植物及副业生产，生产搞得更加有声有色。
