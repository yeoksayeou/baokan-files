As of now, small farm tools and old-style large farm tools are still used extensively and frequently in agricultural production in our province. Especially small farm tools, every one of the over ten million agricultural laborers in the province needs to use them, and needs to use them every day. Without a sufficient quantity and good quality of small farm tools, we cannot guarantee the attendance rate of commune members, and it will affect the completion of agricultural production tasks. Facts have proven that constantly doing a good job in the repair, manufacture, and management of small farm tools and old-style farm tools is an important aspect of leading agricultural production work, and there must be no negligence in this regard.

Since the communization, with the great development of agricultural production, our province has correspondingly strengthened the repair, manufacture, and management of small farm tools and old-style farm tools, especially in the manufacture and promotion of improved farm tools and semi-mechanized tools, and has achieved great results, playing a great role in promoting the improvement of labor efficiency and increasing production. However, due to the increase in labor force attending work, the expansion of production tasks, and the increase in agricultural capital construction, the demand and consumption of small farm tools and old-style farm tools have also increased accordingly. In addition, some places do not have enough understanding of this new characteristic, and the repair and replenishment work has not kept up, resulting in a shortage of small farm tools and old-style farm tools. According to a survey of four communes, Wengjiang in Pingjiang, Huanghua in Changsha, Gugang in Liuyang, and Shatou in Yiyang, if the missing farm tools are replenished and the farm tools that need to be repaired are repaired, labor efficiency can be improved by about 15%. This potential is very large. Therefore, we must quickly take effective measures to earnestly do a good job in the repair, replenishment, and management of small farm tools and old-style large farm tools, to create more favorable conditions for running agriculture in a big way and running food production in a big way. Based on our experience, the following tasks should be done currently:

First, in accordance with the spirit of acting while planning, we must quickly launch a campaign to repair and manufacture small farm tools and old-style large farm tools on a large scale, concentrate enough iron, wood, and bamboo workers and raw materials, and complete the repair and manufacturing tasks in batches and phases. The repair and replenishment of small farm tools and old-style large farm tools should focus on repair, and combine repair and manufacture. This work should be started early and arranged early, and should be fully completed before the spring plowing next year, to ensure production needs.

Second, the policy of self-preparation, self-use, self-repair, and self-management should be resolutely implemented for small farm tools commonly used by commune members when attending work. Because every laborer needs small farm tools, and the quantity is large and the use is frequent, self-preparation by commune members is convenient for taking, convenient for maintenance, and beneficial to production and management. This has been repeatedly proven in practice.

Third, distinguish the scope, stipulate the limits of authority, clarify responsibilities, and establish a responsibility system for the management of farm tools by communes, brigades, production teams, and work groups. According to the existing experience in various places, the following issues should be mainly resolved: 1. According to the principles of benefiting production, facilitating the masses, and facilitating management, the scope of use and management authority of public farm tools should be determined. Public farm tools such as plows, harrows, cultivators, mud boats, windmills, waterwheels, and earth carts are mainly managed by work groups. Farm tools and agricultural machinery that are not convenient for work groups to manage are managed by production teams, brigades, and communes respectively according to the actual situation. 2. Brigades, production teams, and work groups should all be equipped with farm tool custodians and establish farm tool storage rooms. Custodians should be selected from commune members with good backgrounds, high awareness, enthusiasm for collective undertakings, and certain experience in managing farm tools. The duties of the custodians are, on the one hand, to regularly check and clean up farm tools, and promptly propose plans for the repair and manufacture of farm tools according to the damage and needs of the farm tools; on the other hand, on the basis of strengthening ideological education for commune members to cherish public property, establish and implement the registration, issuance, compensation, and other systems for farm tools. Since Wu Ji Commune in Hengshan County adopted these methods in February this year, a situation of "every farm tool is managed by someone, every farm tool is stored in a room, and everyone has tools to use" has quickly emerged. Commune members use farm tools skillfully, take them conveniently, improve work efficiency, and greatly save farm tool repair costs. The farm tool repair cost of Yueping Brigade of this commune was 425.5 yuan from May to October last year, and only 213.5 yuan in the same period this year, a reduction of half.

Fourth, clarify the management policy and appropriately adjust the farm tool repair and distribution network. Commune agricultural machinery factories should adhere to the policy of serving agricultural production and place the repair and manufacture of small farm tools and old-style large farm tools in the primary position, as a regular and long-term production task. In order to facilitate production and the masses, commune agricultural machinery factories should also organize a group of iron, wood, and bamboo workers to enrich the farm tool repair and distribution stations of the brigades according to production needs. It is also possible for the commune agricultural machinery factory to set up farm tool repair and distribution points in each brigade, carry out mobile repairs, and contract for each area, so as to ensure quantity, quality, and season, and closely combine the repair and manufacture of farm tools with use.

    修好、造好、管好小农具
    中共湖南省委农村办公室副主任  张邦信
    目前，我省农业生产上大量使用和经常使用的仍然是小农具，旧式大农具。特别是小农具，全省一千多万个农业劳动力，人人都要用，天天都要用，没有数量足、质量好的小农具，就不能保证社员的出勤率，就会影响农业生产任务的完成。事实证明：经常作好小农具和旧式农具的修制与管理，是领导农业生产工作的一个重要方面，决不能有任何疏忽。
    公社化以来，随着农业生产的大发展，我省相适应地加强了小农具、旧式农具的修制和管理工作，特别是在改良农具和半机械化工具的制造和推广使用方面，取得了很大的成绩，对提高劳动工效，增加生产，起了很大的促进作用。但是，由于出工劳动力增加，生产任务扩大，农业基本建设增多，小农具和旧式农具的需要量和损耗量也随着增加了；加上有的地方对这一新的特点认识不够，修制补充工作没有跟上去，以致小农具和旧式农具出现不足现象。据平江瓮江、长沙黄花、浏阳古港、益阳沙头等四个公社调查，如果把所缺的农具补齐，把需要修理的农具修好，可以提高劳动效率15％左右，这个潜力是很大的。因此，我们必须迅速采取有效措施，切实作好小农具、旧式大农具的修理、补充和管理工作，为大办农业，大办粮食创造更为有利的条件。根据我们的体会，当前要做好以下几项工作：
    一、根据边行动、边规划的精神，迅速开展一次大修大造小农具和旧式大农具的运动，集中足够的铁、木、篾工人和原材料，分批分期完成修制任务。对小农具和旧式大农具的修理补充，应当以修为主，修制并举。这一工作要早动手，早安排，务期在明年春耕以前，全面完成，以保证生产需要。
    二、社员出勤常用的小农具坚决贯彻执行自备、自用、自修、自管的政策。因为每一个劳力都需要小农具，而且数量大，使用经常，由社员自备，便于取用，便于保养，有利生产，有利管理，这是在实践中反复证明了的。
    三、分清范围，规定权限，明确责任，建立公社、大队、生产队、作业组管理农具的责任制。根据各地已有的经验，主要解决以下问题：1、根据有利生产，便利群众，便于管理的原则，把公有农具的使用范围和管理权限确定下来。公有农具如犁、耙、中耕器、泥船、风车、水车、土车子等主要由作业组管理，那些不便于作业组管理的农具和农业机械，按实际情况分别由生产队、大队、公社管理。2、大队、生产队、作业组都要配备农具保管员，建立农具保管室。保管员要挑选成分好，觉悟高，热心于集体事业，有一定管理农具经验的社员担任。保管员的职责，一方面是定期检查清理农具，根据农具的损坏和需要情况，及时提出农具的修理制造计划；另一方面在加强对社员爱护公共财物的思想教育的基础上，订立和执行农具的登记、领发、赔偿等制度。衡山吴集公社于今年2月采取这些办法以后，迅速出现了“件件农具有人管，样样农具有室藏，人人都有工具用”的局面。社员使用农具得心应手，取用方便，提高了工效，而且大大节约了农具修理费用。这个社的岳坪大队去年5月份到10月份的农具修理费达四百二十五点五元，今年同期只用了二百一十三点五元，减少了一半。
    四、明确经营方针，适当调整农具修配网。公社农械厂应当坚持贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，把小农具和旧式大农具修理制造工作放在首要位置上来，作为一项经常的、长期的生产任务。为了便利生产、便利群众，公社农械厂还应当根据生产需要，组织一批铁、木、篾工人，去充实大队的农具修配站。也可以由公社农械厂在每个大队设立农具修配点，巡回修理，分片包干，做到保数量、保质量、保季节，把农具的修制工作和使用紧密结合起来。
