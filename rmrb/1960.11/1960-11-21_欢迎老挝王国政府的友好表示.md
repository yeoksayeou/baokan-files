According to the communiqué of the Lao government meeting broadcast by Vientiane Radio on the 17th and the first joint communiqué of the Lao Royal Government delegation and the Lao Patriotic Front delegation broadcast on the 18th, the Royal Lao Government, in accordance with the unanimous opinion of the Lao Patriotic Front and the government, has decided to establish friendly relations with our country and will send a friendly delegation to visit the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Our government issued a statement yesterday supporting this friendly decision of the Royal Lao Government and is prepared to take corresponding measures to facilitate its realization.

The Chinese people have always cherished the long-standing and profound friendship between the Chinese and Lao people and hope that China and Laos will become harmonious neighbors. In August 1956, when Premier Zhou Enlai welcomed the Lao Royal Government delegation headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma to visit our country, he clearly stated: "China will unswervingly base its relations with Laos on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and be a good friend and good neighbor of Laos." The Chinese government has consistently strictly adhered to the Geneva Accords, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the Bandung Conference spirit, respecting Laos' independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and supporting the Royal Lao Government in implementing a policy of peace and neutrality and achieving domestic unity.

Implementing a policy of peace and neutrality is the common aspiration of the vast majority of the Lao people. As early as 1956, Prime Minister Phouma explicitly announced that the Kingdom of Laos pursued a policy of peace and neutrality and, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, established friendly relations with all countries, especially its neighbors, that Laos would not join any military alliance, and would not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on Lao territory. These policies are conducive to consolidating Laos' peace and independence, achieving Laos' democracy, unity, prosperity, and strength, to the implementation of the Geneva Accords in the Indochina countries, and to maintaining the cause of peace in Southeast Asia.

The U.S. imperialism has consistently interfered with and undermined the policy of peace and neutrality pursued by the Royal Lao Government. After repeatedly failing to coerce the Phouma government to abandon its policy of peace and neutrality by cutting off "aid," U.S. imperialism overturned the Phouma government in July 1958, supported the pro-American group to come to power, and directed them to openly abandon the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, provoking civil war, and attempting to gradually turn Laos completely into a U.S. colony and military base. U.S. imperialism's interference and aggression have seriously damaged Laos' independence and threatened Laos' security. This cannot but arouse increasingly strong opposition from the vast majority of the Lao people. After the victory of the August 9th coup, which was supported by the broad masses of the Lao people, Prince Souvanna Phouma was reappointed to form a government and announced the implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality and national harmony.

However, U.S. imperialism, unwilling to accept defeat, is still trying to make a comeback, blatantly supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group, plotting to overthrow the Phouma government once again. According to the Pathet Lao Radio, as of now, U.S. imperialism has given the Nosavan group 16 million U.S. dollars, transported a large number of weapons from Thailand and South Vietnam, helped build airports and open up new air routes, dispatched officers to train and command the rebel group's army, and sent foreign soldiers disguised as the Nosavan group's army to strengthen the rebel group's forces and plan an attack on Vientiane. On November 11, U.S. imperialism again supported the Phoumi Nosavan group in launching a new rebellion in Luang Prabang, kidnapping the King of Laos. The U.S. government's pressure on the Phouma government is also becoming increasingly crude. The U.S. State Department even threatened Prime Minister Phouma not to "use force" against the rebellion in Luang Prabang, blatantly preventing the Lao government from establishing friendly relations with China and Vietnam.

From November 16 to 18, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization held a three-day "military advisory meeting" in Bangkok to plan an invasion of Laos. Admiral Felt, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Pacific region, who represented the United States at the meeting, arrogantly clamored that his troops were "ready to be called upon" to send troops at any time. Thai Deputy Prime Minister Nai Thanom falsely accused Laos of "violating" the Thai border, clamoring for drastic "retaliatory" actions against Laos, even at the cost of war with Laos.

These facts show that U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are stepping up their conspiracy to overthrow the Royal Lao Government.

Due to the U.S. imperialism's crude interference in Laos' internal affairs, the situation in Laos is still very serious. On the road of the Lao people's struggle for and safeguarding peace and independence, and realizing democracy, unity, prosperity, and strength, there are still various difficulties and obstacles. However, in the face of the vast Lao people who are determined to defend the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are difficult to succeed. Lao Prime Minister Prince Phouma condemned the United States for supporting the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group at a press conference on the 16th. Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued a letter to the whole nation on November 17, calling on all the people to unite closely and smash the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique to overthrow the Phouma government. The spokesman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front warned U.S. imperialism and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization: If U.S. imperialism and its running dogs dare to invade Laos, they will be resolutely countered by the Lao people. These propositions have been warmly supported by the Lao people.

China, as a participant in the Geneva Conference and a close neighbor of Laos, has always deeply sympathized with and supported the just struggle of the Lao people to defend their sovereignty and safeguard peace in the Indochina region. In its statement, our government strongly condemned the U.S. imperialism's crude interference in Laos' internal affairs, firmly supported the legal government of the Kingdom of Laos headed by Phouma, and believed that "as long as the Lao people can strengthen internal unity and resolutely oppose external interference and subversion activities, they will surely be able to overcome the difficulties on the road ahead, realize Laos' peace and neutrality, national harmony and state unity, and build the Kingdom of Laos into a prosperous and strong country."

The Chinese People welcome the expression of the Phouma Government to adhere to the policies of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and welcome its decision to establish friendly and neighborly relations with the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. We firmly believe that if this proposal can be realized, it will surely be conducive to the establishment and development of friendly and neighborly relations and economic and cultural relations between our two countries.

### 欢迎老挝王国政府的友好表示

    欢迎老挝王国政府的友好表示
    据万象电台17日广播的老挝政府会议的公报和18日广播的老挝王国政府代表团同老挝爱国战线党代表团谈判的第一号联合公报，老挝王国政府按照老挝爱国战线党和政府的一致意见，已决定同我国建立友好关系，并将派遣友好代表团访问中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国。我国政府已于昨日发表声明，支持老挝王国政府这一友好的决定，并且准备采取相应措施，促其实现。
    中国人民向来非常珍视自己同老挝人民之间悠久而深厚的友谊，希望中国和老挝成为和睦相处的邻邦。1956年8月，我国周恩来总理在欢迎以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府代表团来我国访问时，就曾经明确表示：“中国将坚定不移地在和平共处五项原则的基础上，做老挝的好朋友和好邻居。”中国政府一贯严格信守日内瓦协议、和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，尊重老挝的独立、主权和领土完整，支持老挝王国政府执行和平中立和实现国内团结的政策。
    实行和平中立政策，是老挝广大人民的普遍愿望。还在1956年，富马首相就明确宣布老挝王国奉行和平中立政策，以及根据和平共处的五项原则，同各国、特别是各邻国建立友好的关系，老挝将不加入任何军事联盟，不容许在老挝领土上建立外国军事基地。这些政策，有利于巩固老挝的和平、独立和实现老挝的民主、统一和富强，有利于日内瓦协议在印度支那各国的实施，有利于维护东南亚和平的事业。
    对于老挝王国政府奉行的和平中立政策，美帝国主义一贯加以横蛮的干涉和破坏。美帝国主义在屡次以断绝“援助”胁迫富马政府放弃和平中立政策失败之后，竟在1958年7月颠复了富马政府，扶植亲美集团上台，指使他们公然毁弃日内瓦协议和万象协议、挑起内战，企图一步一步地把老挝完全变成美国的殖民地和军事基地。美帝国主义的干涉和侵略，严重地损害了老挝的独立，威胁着老挝的安全。这就不能不激起老挝广大人民越来越强烈的反对。得到广大老挝人民支持的8月9日政变胜利以后，梭发那·富马亲王重新受命组织政府，并宣布奉行和平中立和民族和睦的政策。
    可是，不甘心失败的美帝国主义仍图卷土重来，露骨地支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团，阴谋再一次颠复富马政府。据寮国战斗部队电台揭露，截至目前为止，美帝国主义给了诺萨万集团一千六百万美元，从泰国和越南南方运去大批武器，帮助建造飞机场、开辟新航线，派遣军官训练和指挥叛乱集团的军队，派遣外国军人混充诺萨万集团的军队，增强叛乱集团的力量，策划进攻万象。11月11日，美帝国主义又支持富米·诺萨万集团在琅勃拉邦发动新的叛乱，劫持老挝国王。而美国政府对于富马政府的压力也日益粗暴。美国国务院甚至威胁富马首相，不得对琅勃拉邦的叛乱“使用武力”，公然阻止老挝政府同中越两国建立友好关系。
    11月16日到18日，东南亚条约组织在曼谷举行为期三天的“军事顾问会议”，策划侵略老挝。代表美国参加这次会议的美国太平洋地区武装部队总司令费耳特狂妄地叫嚣，他的部队随时都“准备应召”出兵。泰国副总理乃他侬则诬蔑老挝“侵犯了”泰国边境，叫嚷要对老挝采取激烈的“报复”行动，甚至不惜同老挝作战。
    上述这些事实表明：美帝国主义及其走狗正在加紧进行推翻老挝王国政府的阴谋活动。
    由于美帝国主义对老挝内政进行粗暴干涉，目前老挝的局势，依然是十分严重的。在老挝人民争取和维护和平、独立，实现民主、统一和富强的道路上，还有种种困难和障碍。然而，在决心保卫和平中立和民族和睦的政策的老挝广大人民面前，美帝国主义及其走狗的阴谋是难以得逞的。老挝首相富马亲王16日在一次记者招待会上谴责了美国支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团。老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯11月17日发表告全民书，号召全体人民紧密团结，粉碎美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团推翻富马政府的阴谋。老挝爱国战线党中央发言人警告美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织：如果美帝国主义及其走狗胆敢侵犯老挝，必将遭到老挝人民的坚决反击。这些主张，得到了老挝人民的热烈拥护。
    中国是日内瓦会议的参加者，是老挝的紧邻，对于老挝人民保卫主权、维护印度支那地区和平的正义斗争，一向寄予深切的同情和支持。我国政府在声明中严厉谴责了美帝国主义对老挝内政的粗暴干涉，坚决支持以富马为首的老挝王国的合法政府，并且认为“只要老挝人民能够加强内部团结，坚决反对外力的干涉和颠复活动，就一定能够战胜前进道路上的困难，实现老挝的和平中立、民族和睦和国家统一，把老挝王国建设成为一个繁荣富强的国家。”
    中国人民欢迎富马政府坚持奉行和平中立和民族和睦政策的表示，欢迎它关于建立同中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国友好睦邻关系的决定。我们深信，这一建议如能实现，必将有利于我们两国友好睦邻关系和经济文化关系的建立和发展。
