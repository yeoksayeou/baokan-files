Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch from Rome: The "Unita" newspaper on the 29th published an interview with Abbas, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, by a reporter from the newspaper on his recent visits to China and the Soviet Union.

Abbas said that Algeria has been at war for six years, and the Algerian people have suffered for six years from a war that is not only unjust but also cruel. French imperialism is doing everything possible to oppress a small nation. Therefore, Algeria needs allies, and it has found allies in Beijing and Moscow. These two major countries can help Algeria materially and diplomatically, not to mention that Algeria can also learn from the experience of these countries' socialist construction.

Abbas said that the leaders of China and the Soviet Union understand the importance of the Algerian people's struggle and have unhesitatingly given their support, and their assistance is multifaceted.

Abbas said that the Algerian people must demand and accept all possible assistance, no matter where it comes from. The Algerian people cannot allow themselves to be killed by Western weapons.

Abbas said that his trip to China and the Soviet Union made him aware of a serious, earnest and powerful world, where people are working tirelessly to build a new world. Abbas said that there, the happiness and peace of the people are not just empty talk as in Western countries.

Abbas then spoke of the de facto recognition of the Algerian Provisional Government by the Soviet Union. Abbas said that the de facto recognition by the Soviet Union helps to break the legal hypocrisy of the so-called "French Algeria" and helps to accelerate the arrival of peace, because: the day the Algerian people's right to independence is universally recognized is the day French colonialism is defeated.

Abbas finally spoke of the upcoming debate on the Algerian question at the United Nations. Abbas asked the United Nations to assume all its responsibilities. He pointed out that if the United Nations still refuses to clearly express its recognition of the independence of the Algerian people, it can only undermine its own moral prestige. As for the Algerian people, they are determined to carry on the struggle until they achieve their political goals, and that goal is always independence.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th dispatch: On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian national independence war, Ahmed Tewfik El Madani, head of the Algerian delegation to the United Arab Republic and Algerian representative to the Arab League, told Xinhua reporters on the 29th, "As the sixth year of the Algerian revolution ends, this revolution is stronger than at any time in the past six years in terms of its system, weapons, the number of the Liberation Army, and its unique strategy."

Maidani said, "The Algerian people declared on November 1, 1954, that the purpose of their struggle was to free Algeria from all the military, political, cultural and social constraints of imperialism. These goals remain the main tasks of the Algerian people, government and National Liberation Army. The Algerian army and all the Algerian people are still waging this war until their goals are achieved. The Algerian people will not give up armed struggle unless the freedom and complete independence of Algeria are realized."

In explaining the military situation in Algeria, Maidani said, "It is still implementing the policy of commando warfare. The Algerian Liberation Army still controls all parts of Algeria, including mountains, valleys and deserts. Recently, the Algerian army has begun to use semi-heavy weapons in addition to its original weapons. In mountainous areas such as Kabylie, Orsenis, Oran and North Constantine, Algerian military activities are still taking place fiercely." He said that the number of the Algerian National Liberation Army has reached more than 100,000, and there are still many people and young people who are willing to join the Liberation Army. We select from these people according to our needs and the number of weapons.

When talking about NATO and the United States, Maidani said, "NATO is an enemy of the Algerian people, just as France is an enemy of the Algerian people. We believe that if France did not have the support of NATO's air force and ground forces, it would not be able to sustain this war for six years."

Maidani said, "For us, the United States is the head of Western imperialism because it supports France's war against the Algerian people with capital, economic means, propaganda tools, and its influence over countries under the control of Western capitalism."

When talking about the friendship between China and Algeria, Maidani said that as a member of the Algerian delegation participating in the tenth anniversary celebration of the founding of China, "I personally witnessed the progress made by the Chinese people in the past ten years, their sympathy and support for the Algerian people and their cause, and their readiness to do everything possible to support the Algerian revolution until the revolution is victorious."

Maidani finally said, "On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian revolution, I once again extend my deep respect to the People's Republic of China and its glorious revolution, and express my heartfelt gratitude for its support for the Algerian people's great war of liberation against French imperialism in the past and in the future."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th dispatch: On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian national liberation war, the "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio station published a commentary on the evening of the 30th, pointing out, "It is very clear to us: the only way for us to obtain independence and freedom is armed struggle."

The radio station emphasized, "We will continue our heroic struggle more powerfully, more bravely, more resolutely and more firmly than ever before. The heroes of our young Algerian National Liberation Army will continue to fight heroically against French imperialism until the Algerian people gain independence."

The radio station said that the Algerian government has exhausted all means to achieve a just solution to the Algerian question. The Melun talks were the most recent effort in this regard, but the French government's true intentions have clearly exposed its purpose of continuing the war of aggression in Algeria. Therefore, De Gaulle's claim to restore peace in Algeria is nothing more than a cover for appeasing the angry Algerian people.

The radio station pointed out that since the beginning of the revolution, the Algerian people have realized that the struggle will be arduous, the sacrifices will be significant, and French imperialism will use various conspiracies and tricks to make the Algerian people deviate from their goals; however, the Algerian people have full confidence that they will surely gain independence and freedom and crush the brutal imperialist forces.

    阿巴斯总理对意大利“团结报”记者发表谈话
    阿尔及利亚人民将坚持斗争到独立
    迈达尼谴责美国支持侵阿战争“共和国之声”电台揭露戴高乐的假和平面目
    新华社31日讯　罗马消息：29日的“团结报”登载了阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯就他最近访问中国和苏联对该报记者的谈话。
    阿巴斯说，阿尔及利亚处于战争状态已经六年了，阿尔及利亚人民六年来遭受着一场不仅是非正义的而且是残酷的战争。法帝国主义竭尽全力压迫一个弱小民族。因此阿尔及利亚需要同盟者，而且在北京和莫斯科找到了同盟者。这两个大国能够在物质上和外交上帮助阿尔及利亚，当然更不必说，阿尔及利亚还可以从这些国家的社会主义建设的经验中取得教益。
    阿巴斯说，中国和苏联两国的领导人都了解阿尔及利亚人民的斗争关系重大，而且毫不犹豫地给予支持，他们的援助是多方面的。
    阿巴斯说，阿尔及利亚人民必须要求并且接受不论来自何方的一切可能的援助。阿尔及利亚人民不能听任自己被西方国家的武器杀死。
    阿巴斯说，他的中国和苏联之行使他认识了一个严肃认真的强大的世界，人们在不辞辛劳地建设一个新世界。阿巴斯说，在那里，人民的幸福和和平，不是像在西方国家那样只是空谈。
    阿巴斯接着谈到了苏联在事实上承认阿尔及利亚临时政府的影响，阿巴斯说，苏联事实上的承认有助于破除所谓“法属阿尔及利亚”的法律上的虚伪性，有助于加速和平的到来，因为：阿尔及利亚人民享有独立的权利得到普遍承认之日，也就是法国殖民主义被击败之时。
    阿巴斯最后谈到了即将在联合国进行的阿尔及利亚问题的辩论，阿巴斯要求联合国负起自己的一切责任。他指出，如果联合国仍然拒不明确表示承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立，那只能破坏自己的道义上的威信。至于阿尔及利亚人民，他们决意把斗争进行下去，直到达到自己的政治目标，而这个目标始终是独立。
    据新华社开罗30日电　在阿尔及利亚民族独立战争六周年前夕，阿尔及利亚驻阿联代表团团长、阿尔及利亚驻阿拉伯联盟代表艾哈迈德·陶菲克·迈达尼29日接见新华社记者时说，“当阿尔及利亚革命第六年结束时，这个革命就其体制、武器、解放军的人数和它特有的战略来说，已比过去六年内的任何时候更为强大。”
    迈达尼说，“阿尔及利亚人民在1954年11月1日宣布，他们斗争的目的是使阿尔及利亚摆脱帝国主义在军事、政治、文化和社会等方面的各种束缚。这些目标仍然是阿尔及利亚人民、政府和民族解放军的主要任务。阿尔及利亚军队和全体阿尔及利亚人民仍然在进行这种战争，直到他们的目标实现为止。阿尔及利亚人民将不放弃武装斗争，除非是阿尔及利亚的自由和彻底独立得到实现。”
    迈达尼在说明阿尔及利亚的军事情况时说，“它仍然在执行突击战的方针。阿尔及利亚解放军仍然控制着阿尔及利亚国内包括山岭、溪谷和沙漠在内的各个地方。最近，阿尔及利亚军队除了原来的武器以外开始使用半重型的武器，在卡比利、奥尔森尼斯、奥兰和北君士坦丁这样一些山区里，阿尔及利亚的军事活动仍然在激烈地进行。”他说，阿尔及利亚民族解放军的人数已达到十多万人，而现在还有很多愿意加入解放军的人和青年。我们根据我们的需要和武器的数量在这些人中进行挑选。
    迈达尼在谈到北大西洋公约组织和美国时说，“北大西洋公约组织是阿尔及利亚人民的敌人，正像法国是阿尔及利亚人民的敌人一样。我们认为，如果法国没有北大西洋公约组织的空军和地面部队的支持，它不能把这种战争坚持六年。”
    迈达尼说，“对我们来说，美国是西方帝国主义的头子，因为它用资本、经济手段、宣传工具和它对西方资本主义控制之下的国家的影响，支持法国反对阿尔及利亚人民的战争。”
    迈达尼在谈到中国同阿尔及利亚的友谊时说，作为参加中国建国十周年庆典的阿尔及利亚代表团的团员，“我亲眼看到了中国人民在过去十年中所取得的进步，他们对阿尔及利亚人民及其事业的同情和支持，他们随时准备尽一切办法支持阿尔及利亚革命，直到革命胜利为止。”
    迈达尼最后说，“值此阿尔及利亚革命六周年之际，我再次向中华人民共和国及其光荣的革命致以深切的敬意，并且对它在过去和将来给予阿尔及利亚人民反对法帝国主义的伟大解放战争的支持表示衷心的感谢。”
    新华社开罗30日电　在阿尔及利亚民族解放战争六周年纪念的前夕，“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台30日晚上发表评论指出，“对我们来说已经很清楚：我们获得独立和自由的唯一方法就是武装斗争”。
    这家电台强调说，“我们将比过去任何时候更加有力、更加勇猛、更加坚决和坚定地来继续我们的英勇斗争。我们年青的阿尔及利亚民族解放军的英雄们将继续进行反对法帝国主义的英勇战斗直到阿尔及利亚人民获得独立为止。”
    这家电台说，阿尔及利亚政府已经用尽了一切办法使阿尔及利亚问题获得公正的解决，默伦谈判是在这方面所作的最近一次努力，但是法国政府的真正意图已经清楚地暴露了它的目的是要在阿尔及利亚继续进行侵略战争。因此，戴高乐的关于恢复阿尔及利亚和平的说法，只不过是缓和愤怒的阿尔及利亚人民的遁辞。
    这家电台指出，从革命开始以来，阿尔及利亚人民就已经认识到，斗争将是艰苦的，牺牲将是重大的，法帝国主义将运用各种阴谋诡计来使得阿尔及利亚人民离开他们的目标；但是，阿尔及利亚人民有着充分的信心，一定要获得独立和自由以及粉碎残暴的帝国主义势力。
