Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th. General Heo Bong-hak, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, hosted a banquet at the Okryu Hall in Pyongyang tonight to bid farewell to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe, which accompanied the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to North Korea for a performance tour.

    Present at the banquet were General Choi Yong-jin, Vice Minister of National Defense of Korea, Major General Li Chang-soo, Deputy Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, Choi Sung-sook, Vice Chairman of the Korean Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, and Heo Seok-shin, Director of the Third Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Colonel Wang Yongnian, head of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe, Colonel Li Gan, Political Commissar, Lieutenant Colonel Li Saizhong, Deputy Head, Lieutenant Colonel Wei Feng, Deputy Political Commissar, and all members of the Art Troupe attended the banquet. Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang, Military Attaché Colonel Zhang Leting, and Cultural Counselor Li Lin were also invited to attend.

    In his speech at the banquet, General Heo Bong-hak first expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe for its performance tour in Korea. He said that the Art Troupe's performance has contributed to strengthening the friendship and unity between the people and armies of Korea and China, cemented with blood. Because the Art Troupe's performance is highly ideological and artistic, it has been warmly praised by the Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army wherever it goes. Through the Art Troupe's performance, we have seen the life of the Chinese people and the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who are constantly making great leaps forward under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the brilliant achievements of the rapidly developing culture and art.

    He finally expressed the hope that the Art Troupe will convey the militant friendship and friendly greetings of the Korean people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army to the fraternal Chinese people and the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army after returning home.

    Then, Colonel Wang Yongnian, head of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe, spoke at the banquet. He first expressed his gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, and the leaders at all levels of the People's Army for their care for the Art Troupe, and to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army troops for their warm welcome and cordial reception. He said that during our short 36-day visit to Korea, we deeply felt the unparalleled depth and warmth of the militant friendship between the people of China and Korea, forged with blood. When we arrived in various places and met with the comrades of the Korean People's Army, the enthusiastic welcome of the comrades of the Korean People's Army and our inner excitement merged together into an ocean of friendly joy, much like the scene of the victorious meeting of the Chinese and Korean brotherly troops fighting side by side, dancing and singing, enjoying themselves to the fullest. Whenever we left a place, we sang and danced, and after dancing, we sang again, with endless words, endless friendship, reluctance to part, and reluctance to separate. Even if it rained heavily, we had to brave the rain to see each other off, saying goodbye again and again, sending each other off for another journey, the tears of parting mingled with the raindrops.

    He said that we deeply know that our performance tour can be warmly welcomed by the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, not because of artistic magic, but because of the deeply affectionate militant friendship between the people of China and Korea. This is not a theatrical performance, but a meeting of comrades-in-arms, a reunion of proletarian family members. We are not performing art, but expressing the sincere feelings of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, and extending greetings and respect to the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army comrades who stand on the eastern outpost of the socialist camp.

    Colonel Wang Yongnian enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the Korean people in the Chollima Movement and in socialist construction. He said that we regard these achievements of the Korean people as our own and feel happy and encouraged. What makes us even happier is that this time we have personally seen how the heroic Korean People's Army has rapidly become a modern steel force, how it is constantly guarding its positions with hundredfold vigilance and monitoring the enemy. We firmly believe that in the past we fought side by side to defeat Japanese imperialism, and fought side by side to defeat the common enemy of the people of the world - US imperialism. In the future, in the struggle to liberate China's territory Taiwan, and to reunify the North and South of Korea, in the common struggle to defend peace and develop socialism and communism, we will still advance hand in hand, fight to the end, and victory belongs to the people of China and Korea.

    Wang Yongnian finally said that with a reluctant mood, we bid farewell to the Korean people and the People's Army comrades. We firmly believe that this visit will further deepen our militant friendship, and at the same time, we will certainly convey the deep friendship of the Korean people and their army to the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army.

    Chinese Ambassador to North Korea Qiao Xiaoguang also delivered a speech at the banquet. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government for their kind care and encouragement to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe, and to the Korean People's Army and the Korean people for their extremely warm welcome to the Art Troupe. He said that the unity between China and North Korea is a model of proletarian internationalist unity.

    At the banquet, the hosts and guests constantly toasted the militant friendship between the people and armies of China and North Korea, the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the health of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Mao Zedong. The banquet was held in a friendly and warm atmosphere.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe conducted a 36-day performance tour in Korea and was warmly welcomed everywhere. The Art Troupe will leave Pyongyang on the 29th to return home.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Art Troupe, led by the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to North Korea, concluded its one-month performance tour in Korea, conveying the greetings and respect of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the broad masses of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army. This morning, they left Pyongyang by special train to return home.

    Those who saw them off at the station included General Heo Bong-hak, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, Cho Yeong-chool, Vice Minister of Education and Culture, and Choi Sung-sook, Vice Chairman of the Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations. Qiao Xiaoguang, Chinese Ambassador to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and staff members of the embassy also saw them off at the station. In addition, many representatives of officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and Pyongyang citizens held bouquets and sent them off at the station.

    On their way back to China, the Art Troupe will give the last four performances in Sinuiju, a border city in Korea.

    新华社平壤28日电　朝鲜人民军总政治局长许凤学上将今天晚上在平壤市玉流馆举行宴会，欢送随同中国访朝军事友好代表团来朝鲜进行访问演出的中国人民解放军文艺工作团。
    出席宴会的，有朝鲜民族保卫省副相崔勇进上将、朝鲜人民军总政治局副局长李长秀少将，朝鲜对外文化联络委员会副委员长崔成淑，外务省第三局局长许锡信等。中国人民解放军文艺工作团团长王永年上校、政委李淦上校，副团长黎塞中校，副政委魏风中校和文艺工作团的全体人员参加了宴会，中国驻朝鲜大使乔晓光、武官张乐亭上校、文化参赞李林等也应邀参加了宴会。
    许凤学上将在宴会上致词时，首先对中国人民解放军文艺工作团在朝鲜进行的访问演出表示深深的感谢。他说，文艺工作团的演出对加强朝中两国人民和军队之间的以鲜血结成的友谊和团结作出了贡献。由于文艺工作团的演出具有高度的思想性和艺术性，因此每到一处都受到朝鲜人民和人民军官兵们的热烈赞扬。我们通过文艺工作团的演出，看到了在中国共产党的领导下，不断大跃进着的中国人民和中国人民解放军官兵们的生活和迅速发展着的文化艺术的辉煌成就。
    他最后表示，希望文艺工作团回国后转达朝鲜人民和人民军官兵对兄弟般的中国人民和中国人民解放军官兵的战斗友谊和友好问候。
    接着，中国人民解放军文艺工作团团长王永年上校在宴会上讲话。他首先对以金日成首相为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府以及人民军各级领导对文艺工作团的关怀，对朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军部队的盛情欢迎和亲切接待表示感谢。他说，我们在访问朝鲜短短的三十六天中，深刻地体会到中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊的无比深厚和温暖。当我们每到一地，会见朝鲜人民军战友们的时刻，朝鲜人民军同志们的热情欢迎和我们内心的激动交流在一起，汇成一个友谊欢乐的海洋，很像中朝兄弟部队并肩作战胜利会师的场面，跳舞唱歌，尽情欢乐；每当离开一地的时候，都是歌罢起舞，舞罢再歌，说不完的话，叙不完的友情，恋恋不舍，依依难分，即使天降大雨，也要冒雨相送，话别一遍又一遍，送别一程又一程，离别的热泪和雨点交融在一起。
    他说，我们深知我们的访问演出，能够得到朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的热情欢迎，不是艺术魔力，而是中朝两国人民充满深情的战斗友谊。这不是剧场的公演，这是战友的会见，这是无产阶级一家亲人的团聚。我们也不是在表演艺术，而是在倾诉中国人民和中国人民解放军对朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的衷情，是向站在社会主义阵营东方前哨的英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军同志们的问候和致敬。
    王永年上校热情赞扬了朝鲜人民在千里马运动中，在社会主义建设中取得的光辉成就。他说，我们把朝鲜人民的这种成就看成是自己的成就一样而感到欢欣鼓舞。更使我们高兴的，是这次我们亲眼看到了英雄的朝鲜人民军是如何飞速地成为一支现代化的钢铁队伍，是如何时时刻刻百倍警惕地守卫着自己的阵地和监视着敌人。我们深信，过去我们并肩战胜日本帝国主义，并肩战胜过全世界人民共同的敌人——美帝国主义，今后在解放中国领土台湾，和朝鲜南北统一的斗争中，在保卫和平和发展社会主义、共产主义的共同斗争中，我们仍将携手并肩前进，斗争到底，胜利是属于中朝两国人民的。
    王永年最后说，我们怀着依依不舍的心情，向朝鲜人民和人民军同志们告别，我们深信通过这一次访问将会更加加深我们的战斗友谊，同时我们一定把朝鲜人民及其军队的深情厚谊转达给中国人民及人民解放军。

    宴会上，宾主不断为中朝两国人民及其军队间的战斗友谊、为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结、为金日成首相和毛泽东主席的健康干杯。宴会是在友好热烈的气氛中进行的。
