    Fearless Warrior
    Lin Shi
    The revolutionary memoir "Opening Jinan" describes a fearless revolutionary warrior, Squad Leader Wang of the Ninth Company: "This sturdy, short, dark-skinned squad leader stood like an immovable, invincible Mount Tai at the breach. He grabbed two boxes of enemy hand grenades and hurled them to the left and right. The enemy shouted, 'Surrender!' He replied, 'Alright! I'm out of bullets, come on, I have sweet potatoes and peanuts here...' As a result, the enemy suffered heavy casualties, but the breach remained under Squad Leader Wang's feet..."
    What a strong warrior! What heroic spirit! In the tense and fierce battle, under the hail of bullets, facing the stubborn enemy, charging forward without fear. Why is this? Squad Leader Wang said, "We stormed up here, and so many comrades sacrificed themselves to take this opening. If I retreat, how much more blood will our comrades have to shed when the troops behind attack again!" How well said! This is the voice of a steel warrior, the voice of a great selfless person. Every word and sentence here rings loudly, encouraging the fighting people!
    Regarding the many aspects of the People's Liberation Army's strength, the enemy can sometimes make relatively accurate calculations, such as how many cannons, how many machine guns, how much ammunition, how many vehicles. Only one thing they can never calculate, and that is the high level of political consciousness of the People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters. How was the city of Jinan opened? How was victory in the war achieved? How was the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang overthrown? There are, of course, many reasons, but an important one is that, under the correct leadership of the Party, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the soldiers was developed a hundredfold, a thousandfold. Our army is composed of thousands upon thousands of people like Squad Leader Wang, who have a high degree of political consciousness. Such an army, with one heart and one mind, with collective wisdom and courage, bravely kills the enemy, fears no sacrifice, and is forever invincible in the world.
    Chairman Mao said: "On the basis of a people's war, on the basis of unity between the army and the people, unity between officers and men, and the disintegration of the enemy forces, the People's Liberation Army has established its own powerful revolutionary political work, which is a major factor in our victory over the enemy." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, page 1248)
    The fearless warrior shines with the light of the Party's revolutionary thought!
    The victory of the battle, the victory of the revolution, every bit of it, comes hard-won. Every inch of land under our feet, every achievement in our hands, is condensed with the blood of revolutionary martyrs. Comrades-in-arms have heroically sacrificed themselves ahead of us in order to win the victory of the revolution, and the people who come after must continue to advance along the revolutionary road they have opened up, following in their footsteps.
    "We stormed up here, and so many comrades sacrificed themselves to take this opening." Yes, this is true of a specific battle, but isn't the entire path of the proletarian revolution the same? When the enemy's fortress has already had a breach opened, the soldiers who rush up must guard this opening, expand this opening, and from this breakthrough, thrust into the enemy's heart and strangle the enemy. Standing at this breakthrough leading to victory, how can we retreat! Retreat is not possible. The road of revolution is traversed in this way: fighting tenaciously, fearing no sacrifice, bravely killing the enemy, and seizing victory.
    Victory forever belongs to the fearless warrior! Victory forever belongs to the people armed with revolutionary will!

    无畏的战士
    林石
    《打开济南府》这篇革命回忆录里，写到了一位无畏的革命战士——九连的王班长：“这个身体粗壮，个子不高、面色黝黑的班长，像座推不动、打不倒的泰山把住突破口，他抓起敌人的两箱子手榴弹，向左右猛打。敌人大喊：‘投降吧！’他说：‘好哇！我没子弹了，你们来吧，我这里有地瓜、花生米……’结果敌人死伤累累，突破口还在王班长脚下。……”
    多么坚强的战士！多么英勇的气概！在紧张激烈的战斗中，在枪林弹雨之下，面对着顽抗的敌人，冲锋陷阵，毫无惧色。这是为什么？王班长说：“我们突击上来，牺牲了多少同志才占了这个口子，我要是退下去，后面部队再突击，又要付出多少同志的鲜血！”说得多好啊！这是钢铁战士的声音，是伟大忘我者的声音，这里的字字句句都铮铮作响，鼓舞着战斗的人们！
    对于人民解放军力量的许多方面，敌人尽管有时可以作出比较精确的计算，例如有多少大炮、多少机枪、多少弹药、多少车辆。唯有一件，他们是永远无法计算的，那就是：人民解放军指战员高度的政治觉悟。济南城是如何打开的？战争的胜利是如何取得的？国民党反动统治是如何推翻的？原因当然很多，其中重要的一条，就是在党的正确领导下，百倍千倍地发扬战士们的革命热忱。我们的部队就是由千千万万个像王班长那样有高度政治觉悟的人组成的。这样的军队万众一心，群威群胆，英勇杀敌，不怕牺牲，永远无敌于天下。
    毛主席说：“在人民战争的基础上，在军队和人民团结一致、指挥员和战斗员团结一致以及瓦解敌军等项原则的基础上，人民解放军建立了自己的强有力的革命的政治工作，这是我们战胜敌人的重大因素。” （《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一二四八页）
    无畏的战士身上，正是闪耀着党的革命思想的光辉！
    战斗的胜利，革命的胜利，每一点每一滴，都是来得不易的。我们脚下的每一寸土地，我们手中的每一个成果，都凝结着革命先烈的鲜血。战友们为了争取革命的胜利，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，后来的人们就要沿着他们开辟的革命道路，踏着他们的足迹继续前进。
    “我们突击上来，牺牲了多少同志才占了这个口子”。是的，一个具体的战斗是这样，整个无产阶级革命的道路不也是这样吗？当着敌人的堡垒已经被突破了口子，冲上来的战士就要守住这个口子，扩大这个口子，并且从这个突破口向敌人的心脏插进去，把敌人扼死。站在这个通向胜利的突破口上，怎么能向后退啊！退却是不行的。革命的道路就是这样走过来的：顽强战斗，不怕牺牲，英勇杀敌，夺取胜利。
    胜利永远属于无畏的战士！胜利永远属于为革命意志所武装的人民！
