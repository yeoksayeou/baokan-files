Xinhua News Agency, 1st: The "Cuban Prints Exhibition," jointly sponsored by the China-Latin America Friendship Association and the Chinese Artists Association, grandly opened this morning in Zhongshan Park.

He said that it is very meaningful to hold the opening of the Cuban Prints Exhibition in our capital today. On behalf of the China-Latin America Friendship Association and the Chinese Artists Association, I extend a warm welcome.

Chu Tunan said that the Chinese people have been following every victory of the Cuban people after overthrowing the US imperialist puppet Batista regime with excitement. The Chinese people firmly support the Cuban people's heroic struggle to defend the revolution, safeguard national independence, and oppose US imperialist intervention.

Dr. Vicentina Antuña Davio, head of the Cuban cultural delegation, said in her speech that the Cuban Prints Exhibition is the first Cuban art exhibition to come to China after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and our country. We regard this exhibition as an expression of the Cuban people's sympathy for the People's Republic of China and their good wishes to maintain close relations with China.

Among the exhibits on display here are scenes depicting the miserable life of the Cuban people under the Batista tyranny in the past, and eulogies to the heroic deeds of the Cuban people in opposing the Batista tyranny. These prints, totaling one hundred and eighteen, were sent by the Cultural Bureau of the Revolutionary Provincial Government of Havana, Cuba.
