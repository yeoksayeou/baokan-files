    Watching a Play
    Hu Ruichuan
    In the late autumn evening, the sun had just set, and the rosy clouds painted the eastern hillside red. Commune members from Guanlegou Village, Menlou Commune, were heading home in groups of three or five after rushing to harvest their crops. Because there was a play to watch in the evening, everyone's face was full of smiles.
    Watching a play is not such a rare thing, but having a play performed in this remote mountain village is indeed unusual. In the past, people had to travel dozens of miles of mountain roads to see a play outside the mountains. The transportation here was too inconvenient. According to the elders, it had been forty-five years since a play had been performed here. Now the mountain village has changed: loudspeakers have been installed in the village, and people can hear news broadcast from Beijing and famous actors singing operas.
    After the Three Autumns campaign began this year, the commune members worked together to complete the autumn harvest and planting tasks ahead of schedule. Therefore, the Literary and Art Service Troupe organized by the Yantai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party came here specifically to comfort the commune members. The actors of the Yantai Lü Opera Troupe carried their luggage and costumes themselves, crossed the ten-mile-wide Menlou Reservoir, climbed over mountain ridges, and crossed mountain after mountain to reach this remote mountain village. The commune members were overjoyed when they heard the news.
    Huang Tian, the captain of the Second Team, was overjoyed when he heard that the Municipal Party Committee had sent the Lü Opera Troupe. He went up the mountain at the first glimmer of dawn. He said to all the team members: "The Party cares about us, and we will respond to the Party with practical actions. We are now harvesting peanuts, and we must ensure that not a single peanut is lost, and report our success to the Party."
    While harvesting peanuts, Huang Tian said, "Tonight they will perform 'Cui Niang Steals the Decree'. This play is good."
      "Yes, brother, this is the second time a play has been performed in our mountain gully since we can remember. I've calculated it, it's been a full forty-five years. Do you still remember the first time we watched a play?" Liu Jiatai, who was the same age as Huang Tian, said, counting on his fingers.
      "How could I not remember? Can such a blood feud be forgotten?" Huang Tian's face changed suddenly. His body trembled slightly, and anger burned in his heart.
    Forty-five years ago, Huang Tian was working for Li Yanwang, a local landlord. Hu Daba, a landlord in the same village, was celebrating his birthday and had hired a troupe from Yantai to perform a play. This was not a good thing for the people in the mountain village, because the poor had to pay eight strings of cash to see the play. At that time, Huang Tian's family of six depended on those who could work and those who could herd pigs, and they barely had enough to eat all year round. Where would they get the money to see the play? What the play was like was still a very novel thing for the young Huang Tian. He pulled his partner Liu Jiatai and said, "Let's go and take a look!"
      "My family doesn't have eight strings of cash."
      "It doesn't matter if we don't have money, we can climb over the north wall."
    The stage was set up in a large field, with two sides against the wall. The two men climbed up shoulder to shoulder. Huang Tian had just stood firm when he was spotted by Hu Jinsheng, the eldest son of the landlord, who came to the base of the wall with a "mourning stick" and scolded Huang Tian and his companion fiercely:
  "You poor ghosts, get down! You're not worthy to watch the play!"
    Huang Tian held back his anger and said nothing. The young man took a few quick steps, raised his stick and hit Huang Tian. Huang Tian dodged and grabbed the stick, pulled it hard into his arms, and Hu Jinsheng slammed into the base of the wall with a thud. He covered his chest and grimaced in pain, stooping to pick up a large brick. This angered Huang Tian, and the anger that had been buried in his heart for many days erupted. He reacted quickly, took a large brick from the top of the wall and smashed it down. There was a thud, and it hit Hu Jinsheng's bones. Hu Jinsheng cried out and fell to the ground. At this time, all the lackeys of the landlord rushed over. Huang Tian and Liu Jiatai jumped off the wall and ran.
    From then on, Huang Tian was fired by the landlord, his wages for the year were deducted, and the landlord tried to arrest him everywhere. He ran away and wandered outside for more than thirty years.
    After liberation, he lived a happy life. He loved to watch plays. Whenever there was a play nearby, he always tried to watch it. When he went to Yantai for medical treatment, he would also watch a small play. Once, there was a play performed in Menlou, more than twenty miles away from Guanlegou. As the sun set, he took a cold cooked sweet potato in his arms and left, returning late at night and working as usual the next day. Therefore, people gave him the nickname "play fan."
    After the commune members finished listening to his story, they quickly finished harvesting the peanuts.
    As night fell, Uncle Huang Tian walked home. After eating, his grandson, Little Pang, threw himself into his arms and said with a grin, "Grandpa, take me to see the play." Just then, the announcer's shrill voice came from the loudspeaker: "Attention everyone, there will be frost tonight at four o'clock, please do a good job in preventing frost damage..."
    The announcer's voice pierced Huang Tian's heart like a nail. He pushed away his little grandson and turned to run out. The commune members who were about to go to see the play also rushed to the team office after hearing the broadcast. Huang Tian shook his dark, bristly beard and said, "Comrades, there will be frost tonight. We still have five acres of high-yield sweet potatoes that haven't been dug up. We originally planned to watch the play tonight and dig them up tomorrow, but we must not let the sweet potatoes be damaged by frost. I think we have no choice but to give up watching the play, I don't know if everyone agrees?" The team members said yes in unison. Some people also suggested that the elderly and children should go to see the play, and the women should not go to the field either.
    Uncle Huang Tian waved his hand and said to everyone, "Let's do it, those of us who are not watching the play, let's go!"
    The moon climbed to the top of the mountain, and the white moonlight covered the ground, and the wind rustled the leaves of the persimmon trees on the mountain. Under the leadership of Captain Huang Tian, the members of the Second Team were digging sweet potatoes. The commune members said as they dug:
      "We opened up twenty more acres of wasteland this year and increased the planting of sweet potatoes by fifteen acres, so we only finished harvesting one day later than other teams, otherwise we would have finished it long ago!"
      "Now we won't fall behind, and we'll report our success tomorrow. From now on, we won't be afraid of frost, even if it snows."
      "It's a pity that we can't see such a good play!"
    Suddenly a voice came from the hillside: "Is Uncle Huang here?"
    Everyone knew at once that this was Hu Xiangchuan, the Party branch secretary of the brigade. Sure enough, he had brought some commune members and said to Huang Tian, "I heard that you are rushing to dig sweet potatoes, and the commune members of the Fourth Team know about it and asked to come and help you!"
    "Thank you for your kindness, you go and see the play. We can complete this task ourselves." Huang Tian expressed his gratitude on behalf of the commune members.
    People were working enthusiastically on the mountain, and from time to time they could hear the faint sound of gongs and drums from the village...
    After the performance, the actors finished their bows and were just about to take off their makeup. Hu Xiangchuan, the Party branch secretary of the brigade, led Huang Tian to the backstage. He shook hands with the head of the troupe and said, "You have worked hard. Tonight, two of our teams, in order to rush to dig sweet potatoes to prevent frost damage, did not get to see the play. Everyone has long admired Lü Opera and is grateful to you for performing in this mountain gully. They would like to meet the comrades."
    "That's fine!" said the head of the troupe, "The hard work of the commune members is worth our learning! I suggest we perform another play for everyone!"
    "That's great!" the actors said in unison, "We'll perform it again!"
    The actors were in an uproar. Those who were taking off their makeup stopped, and those who were washing their faces stopped washing; the huqin players who had already put their huqins in their bags retuned the strings again.
    The Party branch secretary's face flushed red with emotion from the enthusiasm of the actors, and he almost regretted that he should not have asked to meet the actors.
    "It's nothing, we are also supporting agriculture! This is our duty!"
    The gongs and drums sounded, and the commune members looked excitedly at the stage. In a moment, those actors wearing colorful costumes appeared on the stage to the sound of melodious music...

    看戏
    胡睿川
    深秋的傍晚，太阳刚刚落山，彩霞抹红了东山坡。门楼公社官乐沟村抢收作物的社员们，三五成群地往家走。因为晚上要看戏，大家脸上满是笑容。
    看戏本不算什么稀奇事，可是在这偏僻山村里演戏，确实不平常。在过去，人们要看戏都得跑几十里的山路到山外去看。这里的交通太不方便了。据老人们说，这儿已有四十五年没有演过戏了。如今山村变了样：村里安上了喇叭筒，可以听到北京播送的新闻和著名演员唱的戏。
    今年三秋工作开始以后，社员齐心协力把秋收秋种的任务提前完成了。因此，中共烟台市委组织的文艺服务团特意到这儿来慰问社员。烟台市吕剧团的演员们自己背着行李和戏装，渡过十余里宽的门楼水库，爬过一道道山梁，越过一重重山岭，来到这偏僻的山村。社员们听到这个消息，都喜的合不上嘴。
    二小队的队长黄田老叔，一听说市委派来了吕剧团，分外高兴，早晨天蒙蒙亮就上山了。他向全队社员说：“党关怀我们，我们用实际行动来回答党。眼下正收花生，咱们坚决做到颗粒不丢，向党报捷。”
    黄田老叔一边收花生，一边说：“今晚演《翠娘盗令》，这出戏好哇。”
      “嗯，大哥，这是咱记事以来，在山沟里第二次演戏了吧。我算了算，整整四十五年了。你还记得我们第一次看戏吗？”和黄田老叔同岁的刘家泰，扳着指头说。
      “咋不记得，那种血海深仇还能忘记？”黄田老叔的脸刷地一下变了。身子轻轻地颤抖了一下，愤火在心里燃烧了起来。
    四十五年前，黄田老叔正给本村地主李阎王扛活。本村地主胡大巴在家庆寿，从烟台搬来了班子唱戏。这对山村里的人来说并不是一件好事，因为穷人看戏要拿八吊钱。当时黄田家六口人吃饭，扛活的扛活，放猪的放猪，一年到头两根肠子闲着一根，哪有钱去看戏？戏是什么样的，对年青的黄田来说，究竟还是件非常新奇的事，他拉着他的伙伴刘家泰说：“走，咱瞧瞧去！”
      “俺家没有八吊钱呀。”
      “无钱不要紧，咱从北墙头上爬上去。”
    戏台搭在一个大场里，两面靠墙。两个人肩搭肩爬了上去。黄田刚站稳脚步，就被地主家的大儿子胡金生看见，他拿着“哭丧棒”，走到墙根，恶狠狠地冲着黄田他们骂道：
  “穷鬼，滚下去！你也配看戏！”
    黄田忍住气没言语。那小子紧走了几步，扬棍便往黄田身上打。黄田一闪身，抄手把棍拿住，用力往怀里一带，胡金生砰地一声撞在墙根。他捂着前胸疼的咧了咧嘴，哈腰拾起一个大砖。这时惹怒了黄田，多日埋藏在心里的怒火发作了。他手急眼快，在墙头上掀下一块大巴砖砸了下去。只听砰咚一声，中在胡金生的筋骨上。胡金生唉哟一声栽倒在地。这时狗仗人势的家奴全赶来了。黄田和刘家泰跳下墙就跑。
    从此，黄田被地主除了名，扣去一年的工钱，地主还想法到处捉拿他。他跑到外边一直流浪了三十多年。
    解放后，他过着幸福的生活。他爱看戏。附近只要有戏，他总想法去看，到烟台去看病也还顺便看看小戏。有一次，离官乐沟二十余里的门楼演戏，太阳落山的时候，他怀里揣上一块凉熟地瓜就走了，深夜回来，第二天照样干活。因此人们给他起了个外号叫“戏迷”。
    社员们听完了他的叙述，不大一会儿，大家就把花生突击完了。
    夜幕降临时，黄田老叔走到家里。吃过了饭，孙子小胖扑到他怀里，咧着嘴笑迷迷地说：“爷爷，快抱我看戏去。”正在这时候，广播筒里发出广播员尖脆的声音：“各位注意，今天夜里四点有霜冻，要做好防冻工作……”
    广播员的声音，像钉子似地扎着黄田的心。他把怀中的小孙子一推，扭头就往外跑。正准备看戏去的社员们，听见广播也赶到队部办公室来。黄田抖搂着黑喳喳的短胡子说：“同志们，今夜有霜冻，我们还有五亩丰产地瓜没刨，原打算今晚看戏明天再刨，可是我们绝不能让地瓜受到冻害呀。我看咱们只好放弃看戏了，不知大家同意不？”队员齐声说行。还有人提出，让老人和小孩去看戏，妇女们也甭下地了。
    黄田老叔挥了一下手，对大伙儿说：“说干就干，咱们不看戏的走！”
    月亮爬上山顶，白花花的月色撒了一地，风刮得山上的柿子树叶嗖嗖地响。二小队的社员们在队长黄田的领导下在刨地瓜。社员们边刨边说：
      “咱今年多开了二十亩荒地，增种了十五亩地瓜，才比别的队晚收完一天，要不早就收完了！”
      “现在咱也落不了后，明天就报捷去。往后别说下霜，就是下雪咱也不怕。”
      “可惜这样好的戏咱捞不着看了！”
    忽然从山坡那边飞来一声：“黄大叔在这儿吗？”
    大家一听就知道这是大队党总支书记胡祥川。果然是他领来了一些社员，向黄田说：“听说你们突击刨地瓜，四小队的社员们知道了，要求来援助你们！”
    “谢谢大家的好意，你们去看戏吧。这点活路我们自己能完成。”黄田代表社员表示感谢。
    人们在山上热情地劳动着，不时地可以听到从村里传来的隐隐约约的锣鼓声……。
    演完戏以后，演员们谢完幕，刚打算卸装。大队党总支书记胡祥川领着黄田来到了后台，他握住剧团团长的手说：“你们辛苦了，我们今晚有两个小队，为了抢刨地瓜防冻害，没捞着看戏，大家早就羡慕着吕剧，并且感谢你们到这山沟里来演出，想见见同志们。”
    “这行啊！”剧团团长说：“社员们这种干劲值得我们学习！我建议再给大家演个戏！”
    “行啊！”演员们齐声说：“我们再重演一次！”
    演员们轰动起来了。原来卸装的也不卸了，洗脸的也不洗了；已经把胡琴装在袋里的胡琴手又重新把弦上好。
    党总支书记被演员的热情感动的脸喷喷红，简直后悔不该要求和演员们见面了。
    “这没什么，我们也是为了支援农业呵！这是我们的义务！”
    锣鼓响了，社员们兴奋地望着台上。一忽儿，那些披霞戴彩的演员们便伴着幽扬的乐声出现在戏台上……。
