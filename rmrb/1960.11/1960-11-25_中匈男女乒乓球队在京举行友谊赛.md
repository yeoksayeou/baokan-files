Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The strongest European national men's and women's table tennis teams from Hungary held their first visit to China tonight in Beijing with the Chinese national men's and women's table tennis teams. They were warmly welcomed by approximately seven thousand spectators. In the women's team match held first, the Chinese team consisting of Qiu Zhonghui and Sun Meiying, after nearly two hours of hard fighting, won 3-2 against the Hungarian team composed of Koczian, who has won the European women's singles championship three times, and the 24-year-old newcomer, Matte.

The Chinese national men's table tennis team, composed of Rong Guotuan, Wang Chuanyao, and Zhuang Zedong, won 5-2 against the Hungarian national men's table tennis team, the champion of this year's European table tennis team competition, with fierce offensive tactics tonight. Rong Guotuan, who defeated Sido 3-1 in last year's World Table Tennis Championships to win the world singles title, met Sido again tonight and won 2-1. Nineteen-year-old Zhuang Zedong, despite being behind in points tonight, still boldly attacked and also won 2-1 against the 37-year-old Sido.

Berchik, the physically strong two-time European singles champion, combined steady chop defense with powerful sudden smashes, winning 2-1 against Zhuang Zedong and Wang Chuanyao respectively.

The final match of the night was Berchik against Rong Guotuan. The two had previously faced each other six times, with each winning half. Meeting for the seventh time tonight, Rong Guotuan won 2-1.

In the other two matches tonight, Wang Chuanyao and Rong Guotuan defeated Foldi 2-0 and 2-1 respectively.

After this nearly three-hour friendly match, Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, who attended the match, met with the athletes from both sides on the court and took a group photo with them.

The Hungarian national men's and women's table tennis teams will also hold friendly matches with the Chinese youth men's and women's table tennis teams in Beijing on the evening of the 26th.

    身体健壮的两届欧洲单打冠军的别尔切克，以稳健的削球防守结合强劲的突然抽杀，以二比一的比数分别赢了庄则栋和王传耀。
    今晚的最后一场比赛是别尔切克对容国团。在这以前两人曾六次交锋，胜负各半。今晚第七次相遇，容国团以二比一获胜。
