High Aspirations Dare to Subdue White Cloud Peak
By our reporters Cen Lidan and Zhou Yi

On White Cloud Peak, a towering mountain shrouded in mist in the southwest of Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, there is a well-known youth forest farm. This place was originally uninhabited. After cooperativization in 1956, Communist Youth League member Zhou Tiansong, with the lofty ideal of building the mountainous area, led a vanguard team to "green the barren hills," climbing this mountain, more than a thousand meters above sea level. They reclaimed land and planted forests, grew fruits and grains, raised livestock, and built houses on the mountain, restoring the ancient White Cloud Peak to its youth.

Greening White Cloud Peak had been the aspiration of the people of Yuechang at the foot of the mountain for many years. More than forty years ago, White Cloud Peak was extremely rich: the forests blocked out the sky, there were inexhaustible good timbers and unceasing medicinal herbs… More than thirty families on the mountain lived a diligent and prosperous life. But in the era of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, people were forced to be unable to live and work in peace, and the treasure mountain was burned into a poor mountain. After liberation, the People's Government wanted to develop forestry here. After cooperativization in 1956, the Party called on the people to "green the barren hills." Communist Youth League member Zhou Tiansong, the son of a poor peasant from Yuechang, had been selected as an advanced forest fire prevention worker for actively protecting forests and preventing fires after he left Dongguan Normal School to participate in agricultural production. When he heard the Party branch's call to green White Cloud Peak, he was the first to sign up in response. The Party branch, understanding that Zhou Tiansong was a young man with ideals and perseverance, sent him to lead the team up the mountain.

On a clear day in April 1956, twenty young people expressed their determination to the Party, bid farewell to their parents, and carried their quilts, pots, and pans, along with grain and seeds, happily up the mountain. They rested in a "Pangu Temple" on the mountainside, spending their first night using thatch as beds and mountain stones as pillows. The next day, they went to the top of the mountain to cut thatch and dig mountain stones, using the foundations of abandoned houses from more than forty years ago to build thatched sheds.

After settling down, they began reclaiming wasteland. Without cattle, they pulled the plow themselves. As soon as the plow started moving, the plowshare broke. In one morning, they broke three plowshares in a row. Team member Zeng Qunfa angrily threw down the plow and said, "We can't plow!" Zhou Tiansong said, "If we can't plow, we'll have to gnaw open the wasteland with hoes. What does it matter to suffer a little more to green White Cloud Peak!" Encouraged by him, everyone picked up their hoes again and chipped away at the mountain land, hoe by hoe. When winter came, White Cloud Peak was covered in ice and snow, a vast expanse of white. The mountain springs and pools froze over. The young people chiseled ice to get water, and continued to reclaim the wasteland as usual. Even in such difficult days, their cheerful songs often echoed through the valley: "Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of hardship, the wind and rain can't drive us down the mountain, thatch and leaves serve as quilts, green pines and bamboos serve as rooms."

The Party organizations of the county and township cared for this group of young people like loving mothers, repeatedly sending them grain, clothes, farm tools, books, musical instruments, and a radio. They themselves planted rice, sweet potatoes, vegetables, and peanuts on the reclaimed wasteland. Some team members knew how to make wooden clogs, so they started making wooden clogs on the mountain. As income increased, life gradually stabilized.

After more than a year of training on the mountain, everyone became stronger. When the pine cones were bearing seeds, Zhou Tiansong and Zeng Qunfa led everyone, carrying pots, pans, quilts, and rice, to trek to the mountains hundreds of miles away to collect pine nuts. At night, they slept under the trees or in caves. Once, a forest fire broke out. The wind howled, and the fire spread rapidly. To protect the seedlings on the mountain, the team members rescued them fearlessly. The eyebrows and hair of Qiu Qiulian and several others were scorched, and their clothes were burned, but they persevered and fought the fire to the end. Later, the masses at the foot of the mountain also came to help, and finally extinguished the fire.

Honor belongs to those who dedicate themselves to socialism. In the winter of 1958, the White Cloud Peak Youth Forest Farm was honorably named a national advanced collective in youth building socialism. Zhou Tiansong, Zeng Qunfa, and several other Communist Youth League members who had been tempered in wind and rain, joined the Communist Party, and Zhong Yuansheng, Zeng Jihua, and others also joined the Communist Youth League. This group of young people grew up together with the pines on the mountain.

The heroic deeds of developing White Cloud Peak inspired the young people of the whole county, and after communization, more and more people wanted to go to the mountain. This April, the Party organized nearly a hundred more young people to come here. With new reinforcements in the forest farm, production improved day by day.

Today's White Cloud Peak, after being reclaimed by diligent and brave young people, presents a scene of thriving prosperity everywhere. On the day we went up the mountain, as we climbed step by step along the steep and rugged mountain path, we saw that the barren hills and ridges, formerly covered with thorns, were now adorned like embroidery with patches of green carpets. Here were neatly planted eucalyptus, fir, and camellia seedlings, and there were verdant camellias, vegetables, and fruit trees, as well as thriving sorghum, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, pineapples, and rice about to be harvested… In three places on the mountainside, peak, and back, nine thatched sheds and two brick and tile houses were built against the mountain. These were the dormitories, canteens, and meeting and study places for the workers. In addition, there were pigsties and a basketball court. When we arrived, we happened to encounter a meeting of the team members. We found that several of the members were elderly people who had come to settle on the mountain with their daughters-in-law, and the young female members were also holding toddlers who were just learning to speak. In the past four years, this forest farm has planted more than 17,000 mu of pine, fir, camellia, and tung trees, reclaimed more than 600 mu of wasteland, planted miscellaneous grains, fruit trees, and vegetables, and raised more than 40 pigs and cattle and more than 400 chickens and ducks.

White Cloud Peak is no longer a desolate mountain with sparse trees and no inhabitants. In the near future, it will be transformed by this group of idealistic and persevering young people into a socialist and communist "treasure mountain" with dense forests, herds of pigs and chickens, and mountains full of flowers and fruits!

    志高敢伏白云嶂
    本报记者　岑荔丹　周毅
    在广东省惠阳县西南方一座云雾缭绕、峰峦接天的大山——白云嶂上，有一个远近闻名的青年林场。这里原来渺无人烟。1956年合作化后，共青团员周天宋，抱着建设山区的崇高理想，带领着一支“绿化荒山”的尖兵，爬上了这座海拔一千多米的大山。他们在山上开荒造林，种下瓜果杂粮，饲养了牲畜，搭起了房屋，使古老的白云嶂恢复了青春。
    绿化白云嶂，原是白云嶂山下约场一带人民多年来的愿望。四十多年前的白云嶂，富饶极了：林木遮天，有伐不完的良材，采不尽的中药……山上三十多户人家，过着勤劳丰足的生活。但在国民党反动统治的年代里，逼得人们无法安居乐业，烧得宝山变成了穷山。解放后，人民政府要在这里发展林业。1956年合作化后，党号召人民“绿化荒山”。共青团员周天宋，是约场一个贫农的儿子。当他离开东莞师范学校参加农业生产后，曾经由于积极护林防火，被选为护林积极分子。他一听到党支部绿化白云嶂的号召，就第一个报名响应。党支部了解到周天宋是个有理想、有毅力的青年，就派他领队上山。
    1956年4月一个晴天，二十个青年人向党表示了决心，辞别了父母，挑起了棉被、锅盆，带着粮食、谷种，欢天喜地上山了。他们在半山腰的一座“盘古庙”歇下来，用茅草当床、山石做枕度过了第一夜。第二天，就上山顶刈茅草，挖山石，利用四十多年前的废屋基搭起茅棚。
    把家安了下来，就开始垦荒。没有牛，他们自己拉犁，犁刚拉动，犁头碰断了，一个上午，就一连碰断了三张犁头。队员曾群发气得丢下犁说：“犁不成啦！”周天宋说：“犁不成，用锄头也要把荒地啃开。为了绿化白云嶂，多吃点苦算什么！”在他的鼓励下，大家又抡起锄头，一锄一锄地把山地啃开。冬天来了，白云嶂上冰封雪盖，白茫茫一片，山上的泉水、水潭都冻结了。青年们就用铁锹凿冰取水，照常开荒。就在这么艰难的日子里，山谷里仍然经常响着他们愉快的歌声：“不怕难，不怕难，风吹雨打不下山，茅草树叶当被盖，青松翠竹当房间。”
    县和乡的党组织，像慈母一样时刻关怀着这群青年。先后多次给他们送来了粮食、衣服、农具、书籍，还有乐器和一部收音机。他们自己又在开垦了的荒地上，种上了水稻、红薯、蔬菜和花生。队员中有人会做木屐，就在山上做起木屐来，收入增加了，生活也就逐渐安定下来。
    在山上经过一年多的锻炼，大家变得更坚强了。当松果结子时节，周天宋、曾群发领着大家，挑了锅盆、棉被、米粮跋涉到百里外的群山采集松子。晚上，他们就露宿在树下或岩洞里。有一次，山林发生了火灾，狂风呼啸，火势迅速蔓延。为了保住山上的苗木，队员们奋不顾身地抢救。丘秋莲等几个人的眉毛、头发都烧焦了，衣服也被烧破，但他们坚持着和烈火搏斗到底。后来山下的群众也赶来协助，终于扑灭了大火。
    荣誉属于献身给社会主义的人。1958年冬天，白云嶂青年林场光荣地被评为全国青年建设社会主义先进集体。周天宋、曾群发等几个在风霜雨雪中锻炼出来的共青团员，加入了共产党，钟元胜、曾纪华等也加入了共青团。这一群青年和山上的青松一道成长起来了。
    开发白云嶂的英雄事迹，激励着全县的青年人，公社化后，要求上山的人越来越多了。今年4月，党又组织了近百名青年来到了这里。林场增加了生力军，生产更加一天天向上了。
    今日的白云嶂，经过勤劳、勇敢的青年们开垦，到处呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象。我们上山那天，沿着峻峭崎岖的羊肠山路一步步往上爬的时候，见到昔日荆棘丛生的荒山野岭，现在像绣花般缀上一块块绿毯。这里，是栽得整整齐齐的桉、杉、油茶的幼苗，那里是长得青翠欲滴的山茶、蔬菜和果树，还有茁壮的高粱、红薯、甘蔗、菠萝和即将收割的水稻……。在山腰、顶峰和山背的三处地方，依山建起了九座茅棚和两座砖瓦平房。这就是场员的宿舍、食堂和开会、学习的地方。此外，还有猪舍、篮球场。我们来到的时候，刚好碰上召开队员大会。我们发现队员中还有好几个是随着儿媳上山安家落户的老人，年青的女队员还抱着牙牙学语的孩子。四年来，这个林场已经种下一万七千多亩松树、杉树、油茶、油桐，开垦出六百多亩荒地，种下杂粮、果木、蔬菜，共养了四十多头猪牛和四百多只鸡鸭。
    白云嶂，它再不是一个渺无人烟、林木稀疏的荒山了，不久的将来，它将在这群有理想、有毅力的青年手里，变成为一个森林茂密、猪鸡成群、花果满山的社会主义和共产主义的“万宝山”！（附图片）
