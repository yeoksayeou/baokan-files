Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 6th. The Guangzhou branch of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries held a banquet on the evening of the 5th to bid farewell to all the artists of the Japanese theater troupe who are about to return home.

Li Jiarren, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, and Jiao Linyi, Vice Mayor of Guangzhou, attended the farewell banquet.

Feng Naichao, Vice President of the Guangzhou branch of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, delivered a speech at the banquet. He said that this visit and performance in China by the Japanese theater troupe, composed of such a large lineup from five famous Japanese theater groups and overcoming many difficulties, is a great victory for the friendly unity of the Chinese and Japanese people. He also said that during their visit to China, the Japanese theater troupe used performances full of life and fighting spirit to introduce the life of the Japanese people and their heroic struggles against the United States and for patriotism to the Chinese people, strengthened the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Japanese people, and spread the seeds of friendship of the Japanese people in all parts of our country. He expressed his deep gratitude to the Japanese theater troupe and warmly congratulated them on the success of their visit and performance in China.

Murayama Tomoyoshi, head of the Japanese theater troupe, said in his speech that during our visit to China, we felt that the Chinese people are all our friends and are concerned about and support our struggle. He said that our visit to China has made us realize the superiority of the socialist system. Seeing these miraculous facts, we deeply feel that we must transform our beloved motherland into a democratic country. To this end, we must first drive the American imperialists, who are trying to build military bases in Japan and turn Japan into a pawn in launching wars against socialist countries, out of Japan and Asia. He said, we are about to return home, but we are still comrades-in-arms standing on the same front, helping each other, and continuing the struggle. Although the struggle will encounter great difficulties, the final victory will surely belong to the Japanese people. This is what our Chinese friends often tell us. This sentence has gradually become our firm belief.

More than one hundred people, including famous figures from the cultural circles of Guangzhou, attended the banquet.
