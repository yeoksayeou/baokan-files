    Xinhua News Agency, Boston, 22nd. According to a Boston radio broadcast, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp" suddenly received orders from the authorities on the 21st to prepare to go to the Caribbean Sea for "reinforcement." Prior to this, U.S. President Eisenhower had already dispatched U.S. naval and air forces to the Caribbean region to carry out armed intervention in Guatemala and Nicaragua and to conspire to launch an armed attack on Cuba.
    When the United States carried out military provocations against China in the Taiwan Strait and armed aggression against Lebanon in 1958, this notorious "Wasp" pirate warship participated. This year, when the United States interfered in the Congo, the "Wasp" was also active near the Congo.

    美国增派航空母舰去加勒比海
    新华社22日讯　波士顿消息：据波士顿电台广播，美国航空母舰“黄蜂号”21日突然接到当局命令，准备开到加勒比海去“增援”。在此以前，美国总统艾森豪威尔已经派遣了美国海空军去加勒比海地区，对危地马拉和尼加拉瓜进行武力干涉，并阴谋武装进攻古巴。
    当美国在台湾海峡对中国进行军事挑衅和在1958年武装侵略黎巴嫩的时候，美国这艘臭名远扬的“黄蜂号”海盗军舰都曾参与。今年，当美国干涉刚果的时候，“黄蜂号”又曾到过刚果附近活动。
