Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 5th. TASS Moscow, November 5th: Comrade Brezhnev, Member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, gave a speech at the airport:

    Respected Comrade Liu Shaoqi! Dear friends and comrades!

    On behalf of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and the Soviet government, allow me to extend to you – Comrade Liu Shaoqi and all members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation – a heartfelt welcome in Moscow, the capital of our country.

    The Soviet people believe that the participation of representatives of the working people of many countries and Party and Government delegations from socialist countries in the celebration of the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution is yet another recognition of the outstanding global significance of the victory of the ideas of Great October. The Great October Socialist Revolution ushered in a new era in human history and the era of transition from capitalism to socialism.

    This revolution has raised high the banner of proletarian internationalism, laid an unshakable foundation for the unbreakable friendship between the people of all countries, and the foundation of Soviet-Chinese friendship.

    After the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the fraternal friendship between our two peoples has been further strengthened. This friendship is based on the great principles of Marxism-Leninism and the commonality of our goals in the struggle to build socialism and communism, and in the struggle for world peace.

    Our unbreakable friendship brings remarkable results. We Soviet people feel heartfelt joy in the achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

    The unity of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all countries of the socialist camp is a powerful factor and reliable guarantee in ensuring lasting peace and the security of the people of all countries, and in opposing the conspiracies of the imperialist forces of aggression.

    The peaceful policy of socialist countries, based on the Leninist principles of peaceful coexistence, reflects the interests of the people of all countries and all working people.

    The work carried out by the Soviet delegation and other socialist countries' delegations at the 15th session of the UN General Assembly has increasingly strengthened the conviction that the cause of peace will triumph. The Soviet government's proposals on complete and thorough disarmament and on the complete and final elimination of the shameful colonial system, put forward by Comrade Khrushchev at the UN rostrum, have inspired the entire world public and are an extremely important contribution to the cause of world peace.

    Dear Chairman, we welcome you and all members of the Chinese Party and Government Delegation and firmly believe that your visit to the Soviet Union will help further strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and People's China, and help further unite the countries of the great socialist family.

    Long live the eternal fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people!

    Long live the unity of the entire socialist camp!

    Welcome, our dear and respected guests!

    在莫斯科伏努科夫机场上
    勃列日涅夫主席的讲话
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏共中央主席团委员、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席勃列日涅夫在机场讲话尊敬的刘少奇同志！亲爱的朋友们、同志们！
    请允许我代表苏共中央委员会、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和苏联政府在我国的首都莫斯科衷心地欢迎您——刘少奇同志和中华人民共和国党政代表团全体成员。
    苏联人民认为，许多国家劳动人民的代表以及社会主义国家党政代表团的参加伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年庆祝典礼，是对伟大十月的思想胜利的卓越的世界意义的又一个承认。伟大的十月社会主义革命揭开了人类历史新纪元和从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时代。
    这个革命高高地举起了无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，奠定了各国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊的不可动摇的基础和苏中友谊的基础。
    中国人民革命胜利后，我们两国人民的兄弟友谊更加加强了，这种友谊的基础是马克思列宁主义的伟大原则和在争取建立起社会主义和共产主义、争取世界和平的斗争中我们的目标的共同性。
    我们牢不可破的友谊带来卓越的成果。我们苏联人对中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会的领导下取得的社会主义建设成就感到衷心的喜悦。
    在保证巩固的和平和各国人民的安全、反对帝国主义侵略势力的阴谋的斗争中，苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营所有国家的团结一致是一个强大的因素和可靠的保障。
    建立在和平共处的列宁主义原则基础上的社会主义国家的和平政策反映着世界各国人民和全体劳动人民的利益。
    由于苏联代表团和其他社会主义国家代表团在联合国大会第十五届会议上所进行的工作，对于和平事业取得胜利的信念就越来越加强了。赫鲁晓夫同志在联合国讲坛上提出的苏联政府关于全面彻底裁军的建议、关于彻底和最后地消灭可耻的殖民主义制度的建议，鼓舞了整个世界公众，是对于争取世界和平的事业的极其重要的贡献。
    亲爱的主席同志，我们欢迎您和中华人民共和国党政代表团全体成员，并坚信，你们对苏联的访问将有助于进一步加强苏联和人民中国的友谊和合作，有助于伟大的社会主义大家庭各国进一步团结的事业。
    苏联和中国人民永远的兄弟友谊万岁！
    整个社会主义阵营的团结一致万岁！
    欢迎，我们亲爱的和尊敬的客人们！
