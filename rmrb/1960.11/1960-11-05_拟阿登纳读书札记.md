Inheriting the Nazi cause, following the "Fuhrer's" teachings;
Having thoroughly read "Mein Kampf," still feeling there are too few ideas.
Many thanks to the American allies, for sending the "Fuhrer's" manuscripts;
Every word deeply touches my heart, reading it is like finding a treasure.
Widely spreading it among the people, promoting the idea of revenge;
Following the "Fuhrer's" path, stepping up aggression and expansion.
Although times have changed, and today the East Wind prevails;
But to dominate the world, it is worth taking a risk.

    拟阿登纳读书札记
    逸寒　诗  方成　画继承纳粹事业，遵奉“元首”遗教；熟读“我的奋斗”，犹感主意太少。多谢美国盟友，送来“元首”遗稿；字字深得我心，读之如获至宝。广在民间传播，鼓吹复仇思想；沿着“元首”道路，加紧侵略扩张。虽然时移势改，今日东风盛强；但为称霸世界，不妨冒险一场。（附图片）
