	Singing of Friendship to Loved Ones
	——A Record of the Performance Tour of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Arts Troupe in North Korea
    On October 25th of this year, the tenth anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers entering North Korea to fight against U.S. aggression, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Arts Troupe, led by the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to North Korea, performed in North Korea for over a month. They conveyed the greetings and respect of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army to the Korean people and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army. During this period, the more than 300-member Arts Troupe was divided into three sub-groups, starting from the heroic city of Pyongyang, going north to the industrial cities of Chongjin and Hamhung, east to the heroic port of Wonsan, south to the eastern outpost of the socialist camp – Kaesong – and to the various units of the Korean People's Army guarding the peace front. They performed a total of eighty-six shows. The Arts Troupe's songs of friendship echoed throughout northern Korea. More than 180,000 Korean military and civilian audience members watched the performances and had cordial meetings with the comrades of the Arts Troupe. The Arts Troupe received an extremely warm welcome wherever it went, with seas of flowers and forests of flags. The cheers of "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung" and "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong" merged into one. As Colonel Wang Yongnian, head of the Arts Troupe, said: "The thirty-six days of our visit to Korea were thirty-six days of profound internationalist education for us, thirty-six days of living in proletarian brotherly friendship, and thirty-six days that each of our comrades will never forget... In these short days, we deeply experienced the unparalleled depth and warmth of the militant friendship forged with blood between the Chinese and Korean peoples."

	A Festival of Friendship, Songs of Friendship
    Unforgettable was the opening performance of the Arts Troupe in Pyongyang on October 26th. That evening, the National Theater of Pyongyang was especially brightly lit. Premier Kim Il-sung, Chairman Choi Yong-kun, and all the Korean party, government, and military leaders in Pyongyang came to see the performance, accompanied by Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing.
    The colorful curtain opened, and the large chorus, dressed in neat PLA uniforms, sang "Song of General Kim Il-sung" and "The East is Red." These cordial and solemn songs praising the leaders, coming from the hearts of the Chinese and Korean peoples, immediately immersed the entire audience in the enthusiastic atmosphere of Sino-Korean friendship. Then, the magnificent and unrestrained large chorus "Galloping on the Chollima" and the passionate and expansive large chorus "Ode to the Motherland" displayed the magnificent picture of the Chinese and Korean peoples building socialism at high speed side by side. ... When, finally, the dance "Encounter on the Heights" appeared on the stage, the enthusiastic atmosphere of the whole audience reached its peak. Brotherly comradeship between those on and off the stage intertwined. From the beginning of the dance, the audience applauded continuously. When the Chinese and Korean People's Armies on the stage defeated the U.S. aggressors side by side and planted the red flag on the top of the mountain, the applause and cheers rang out even more thunderously. At this time, Premier Kim Il-sung, with a smiling face, and the Korean party and government leaders presented a large flower basket filled with colorful flowers to the actors of the Arts Troupe, and shook hands with them cordially.
    The entire performance included a large number of Korean art programs, which made the Korean audience feel especially surprised and cordial. A group of girls dressed in the elegant long skirts of Korean women, holding the traditional Korean musical instrument – the gayageum – walked onto the stage, and played beautiful melodies, singing the Korean folk song "Eagle Peak Ballad," which praised the heroic deeds of the Korean People's Army soldiers. At this time, a series of exclamations of admiration came from the audience. They applauded and could not believe their eyes and ears. They simply could not believe that foreigners could master the gayageum, which even Korean people find difficult to learn, and could sing and play it so well. Some audience members said: This is because the Chinese comrades fought with us, shared life and death together, have a deep understanding of the life and feelings of our people, and love and respect our national art.
    The famous Korean musician Shin Do-sun said: "This performance consistently sang the praises of the friendship between our two peoples, and it is permeated with the active support and brotherly love that the Chinese people bring to the Korean people."

	The Jubilant Kaesong
    The Korean people did not go to see the performances of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Arts Troupe as if they were watching foreign art programs, but rather with excited hearts to meet their close comrades-in-arms, to relive the militant friendship with the Chinese people, and to see the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese brothers in the Great Leap Forward through the Chinese art programs.
    On November 1st, when the news spread that the Arts Troupe would perform at the Zinan Mountain Square in Kaesong, the entire population of Kaesong rejoiced. That afternoon, Kaesong was practically celebrating a festival. More than three hours before the performance, people eagerly gathered at Zinan Mountain Square, packing the square, which could hold 30,000 people, tightly. Later, more and more people came, and even the hillside opposite the square was filled with people. Hundreds and thousands of people surged to the backstage. An old woman even brought a photo to the backstage to look for Comrade Zhang, the accordion player who had lived in her house in the past. On this day, many people could not see or hear the performance clearly because they were too far away, but they said: "Seeing the Chinese comrades is enough to satisfy us."
    At the end of the performance that day, the applause and cheers from the more than 55,000 people of Kaesong who watched the performance (the current total population of Kaesong is about 100,000) shook the mountains and rivers. Dozens of large bouquets of flowers were thrown from the stage to the audience, and then from the audience back to the stage. People sang "The East is Red" and then "Song of General Kim Il-sung." The enthusiastic and excited crowd danced in collective dances in the square, reluctant to leave for a long time.

	The Hearts of Mothers
    When the news spread that the Chinese People's Liberation Army Arts Troupe was coming to visit, the hearts of thousands upon thousands of volunteer mothers in Korea were more excited than anyone else. How much they wanted to see their Chinese children who had been separated for two years! The following is the story of a volunteer mother meeting the Arts Troupe. When the Arts Troupe was riding in a car and arrived at Xinmu between Pyongyang and Kaesong, they stopped to rest by the side of the road. At this time, an old Korean woman came up to them, and hurriedly asked: "Are you volunteers?" The comrades of the Arts Troupe could not understand the old woman's words, and could only gesticulate anxiously. But the old woman had already recognized her Chinese children from their clothing and expressions, so without saying a word, she unwrapped her package and handed the gifts in the package to the members of the Arts Troupe.
    It turned out that this old woman was a volunteer mother who had taken care of wounded soldiers and washed clothes for the volunteers during the war... She did everything. Her own son, who was in the People's Army, was once wounded and rescued by the volunteers. This time, the old woman was going to see her eldest daughter, who was about to give birth to her first child (the gifts that she had just given to the members of the Arts Troupe were originally intended for her daughter). When she passed by Xinmu, she heard that the comrades of the Arts Troupe had just passed through Xinmu. She thought that as long as they had passed, they would come back. She decided to wait here to see her Chinese children. After waiting until the next day, she finally saw her long-awaited Chinese relatives...
    During this visit and performance tour, the Arts Troupe met many Korean mothers. How much the mothers longed for their Chinese children! The wife of the internationalist martyr Park Jae-geun, who sacrificed his life to save wounded volunteer soldiers, brought honey from her own home to the members of the Arts Troupe and gave them honey water to drink. The famous volunteer mother Gu Fuli gave her dowry set of copper bowls to the Arts Troupe and asked them to pass it on to Deng Fangzhi, the mother of Huang Jiguang. A female member of an agricultural cooperative polished her copper washbasin, which she had used for more than 30 years, until it was crystal clear, and gave it to the female Arts Troupe members to use when putting on makeup. Kim Mama, 64, and Yoon Woo-doo Mama from Nanjeong-ri, Gimcheon County, North Hwanghae Province, who had taken care of 32 wounded volunteer soldiers, and old mama Kim Chul-seon from Sinkye County in this province, traveled more than 200 li to Sariwon to see the Arts Troupe's performance, and brought ginseng and honey to their Chinese children. The comrades of the Arts Troupe also gave the mothers gifts such as wool blankets, and pinned exquisite "August 1st" commemorative badges on the mothers' chests as souvenirs.

	At the Forefront of the Peace Line
    When the Arts Troupe went to various units of the Korean People's Army guarding the eastern outpost of peace to give comfort performances, they experienced the baptism of the most intimate militant friendship in the world. The officers and soldiers of the People's Army welcomed the Arts Troupe from China as if they were welcoming close comrades-in-arms who had been separated for a long time. They built roads leading to the barracks with new sand and stones, and arranged the words "Sino-Korean Friendship" with white pebbles in front of the barracks. When the comrades of the Arts Troupe arrived, the entire unit rejoiced. The leaders of the various units personally came out to greet them. The officers and soldiers of the People's Army vied with each other to lift up the Chinese comrades and walk them through the entire welcoming line. Whenever the Arts Troupe finished performing and said goodbye, people were reluctant to part. When a sub-group of the Arts Troupe departed by car after performing in a certain unit of the People's Army, the local military and civilians lined up in a three- or four-li-long procession, braving the cold rain of early winter and treading through the mud to bid farewell. Crowds of people stood on the distant and nearby hillsides and hilltops to bid farewell, cheering "Long live!" People shook hands and shook hands, embraced and embraced. After the guests got into the car, countless hands stretched in from the car windows, wanting to give the Chinese brothers another hug. The car moved forward for a while, but was blocked by the People's Army officers and soldiers and women who did not want to leave, and the car was pushed back, and this happened five times. The tears of farewell between the hosts and guests and the rain flowed together, just as Colonel Wang Yongnian, the head of the Arts Troupe, said: "The enthusiastic welcome of the Korean People's Army comrades and our inner excitement merged together, forming an ocean of friendship and joy, very much like the scene of the victorious meeting of the Sino-Korean brotherly troops fighting side by side."
    In order to meet more loved ones, the comrades of the PLA Arts Troupe performed almost two shows every day. Even if they traveled by car during the day, as soon as they arrived at a place at night, they immediately organized performances for their Korean comrades-in-arms. Female singer Xu Youguang and others also climbed high mountains and crossed high ridges to comfort the soldiers of the People's Army on the front lines, and performed small programs for them. After listening to Xu Youguang's singing, one of the People's Army's model soldiers excitedly took off the model soldier badge he was wearing on his chest and pinned it on Xu Youguang's chest. He also told Xu Youguang that from now on, Xu Youguang's name would be left on the roll call of this People's Army unit. When the roll call reached Xu Youguang, the most outstanding model soldier in the entire company would answer for Xu Youguang.
    In the various units of the Korean People's Army, the miniature dance drama "Bridge" performed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Arts Troupe was particularly welcomed. This dance drama tells the story of a volunteer soldier and an old Korean woman who mutually covered each other and blew up a bridge guarded by the U.S. military, blocking the retreat of the fleeing U.S. military. Many People's Army soldiers were moved to tears after watching it. Once, after this dance drama was performed, two People's Army soldiers ran excitedly onto the stage with tears in their eyes, and hugged tightly the Arts Troupe actors Yi Bing and Liu Ying, who played the old woman and the volunteer soldier. They also shouted: "We must drive out U.S. imperialism." On another occasion, two People's Army soldiers named Ming Yong-sam and Kim Jong-eun bit their fingers after watching the performance, and wrote the four characters "Sino-Korean Friendship" in their own blood on white paper, and then gave them to the comrades of the Arts Troupe.
    This visit and performance tour of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Arts Troupe, and the welcome it received, once again demonstrated the unbreakable militant friendship forged with blood between the Chinese and Korean peoples, deeply rooted in the hearts of the broad masses of the people. With the passage of time, it will bloom more beautiful flowers year after year and bear more fruitful fruits. (Attached picture)

    友谊歌唱给亲人听
    ——记中国人民解放军文艺工作团访朝演出	新华社记者　王玉章
    今年10月25日，是中国人民志愿军抗美援朝入朝作战十周年，在这个中朝两国人民的友谊节日里，由中国访朝军事友好代表团率领的中国人民解放军文艺工作团在朝鲜进行了一个多月的演出，向朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军官兵转达了中国人民和中国人民解放军对他们的问候和敬意。在这期间，这个有三百多人的文工团分为三个分团，从英雄城平壤开始，北到朝鲜的工业城清津、咸兴，东到英雄港元山，南到社会主义阵营东方前哨阵地——开城，以及守卫在和平防线上的朝鲜人民军各部队，共演出了八十六场，文工团的友谊的歌声响遍了朝鲜北部各地，有十八万多名朝鲜军民观众观看了演出，并同文工团的同志们亲切地会见，文工团所到之处受到了极其热烈的欢迎，到处是花海旗林，“金日成元帅万岁”、“毛泽东主席万岁”的欢呼声汇成了一片。正如文艺工作团团长王永年上校所说：“在朝鲜访问的三十六天是我们深受国际主义教育的三十六天，是生活在无产阶级兄弟友谊中的三十六天，是使我们每个同志永远不忘的三十六天……。我们在这短短的日子里，深刻地体验到中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的战斗友谊的无比深厚和温暖。”
      友谊节日　友谊歌声
    令人永不能忘的是10月26日文工团在平壤举行开幕演出的那一天，这天晚上，平壤市国立剧场的灯火分外辉煌，金日成首相、崔庸健委员长和所有在平壤的朝鲜党政军领导人在贺龙元帅和罗瑞卿大将等的陪同下来看演出。
    彩色的帷幕拉开了，穿着整齐的解放军军服的大合唱队唱起了“金日成将军之歌”和“东方红”，这发自朝中两国人民内心的歌颂领袖的亲切的庄严的歌声，立刻使整个剧场全体观众浸入了热烈的中朝友谊的气氛之中，接着雄浑奔放的大合唱“跨上千里马奔驰”和热情辽阔的大合唱“祖国颂”，又展出了中朝两国人民并肩高速度建设社会主义的壮丽图景。……当最后，舞台上出现了舞蹈“高地相逢”时，全场的热烈气氛达到顶点，台上台下交融着兄弟般的战友之情，从舞蹈一开始观众就一直鼓掌不停，等到舞台上朝中人民军队并肩打败了美国侵略军把红旗插上山顶，掌声和欢呼声更加雷动地响起来。这时，金日成首相满面笑容同朝鲜党政领导人将一个盛着彩色缤纷的花朵的大花篮献给文工团的演员们，并且同演员们亲切地握手。
    整个演出中包括了大量朝鲜艺术节目，这使朝鲜观众特别感到惊喜和亲切。一队穿着朝鲜妇女的萧洒的长裙，拿着朝鲜的古典民族乐器——伽倻琴的姑娘走上舞台，并弹起了优美的曲调，唱起了歌颂朝鲜人民军勇士们的英雄史迹的朝鲜民谣“鹰峰谣”，这时，观众中发出了一阵阵的赞叹声，他们一面鼓掌，一面不相信自己的眼睛和耳朵。他们简直无法相信外国人也能掌握连朝鲜人民也很难学会的伽倻琴还能唱，而且弹唱得那么好。一些观众说：这是由于中国同志们同我们一起战斗，同生死共患难，对我们人民的生活感情有深刻的理解，并热爱和尊重我们的民族艺术的缘故。
    朝鲜著名的音乐家辛道善说：“这次演出始终都在歌颂我们两国人民之间的友谊，这里浸透着中国人民带给朝鲜人民的积极支持和兄弟般的热爱。”
          欢腾的开城
    朝鲜人民不是作为看外国艺术节目去看中国人民解放军文工团的演出的，而是人人怀着一颗激动的心，去会见自己的亲密的战友，去重温同中国人民的战斗友情，去通过中国的艺术节目看中国兄弟们在大跃进中取得的辉煌成就。
     11月1日，当文工团将在开城市子南山广场演出的消息传开来的时候，整个开城的人民欢腾起来了，这天下午，开城简直是过节日，在演出以前三个多小时，人们就迫不及待地涌集到子南山广场上来，把这个能容三万人的广场挤了个密不透风，后来人越来越多，连广场对面的山坡上也坐满了人，还有成百上千的群众涌到台后面来。有一个老大娘还拿着一张照片来到后台找过去在他家住过的手风琴手张同志。这一天有很多群众因为距离太远看不清也听不清演出的节目，但他们说：“看一看中国同志就心满意足了。”
    这一天演出结束时，观看演出的五万五千多开城人民（目前开城人口总数约为十万）一齐发出的掌声和欢呼声，震动山河，几十束大束的鲜花从台上抛到台下，又从台下抛到台上。人们唱了“东方红”，又唱“金日成将军之歌”，热情兴奋的人群欢呼着在广场上跳起集体舞，久久不愿散去。
            妈妈们的心
    当中国人民解放军文工团要来访问的消息传开时，朝鲜的千千万万个志愿军妈妈的心比谁都更加激动，她们多么想看一看离别了两年的中国儿女啊！下面就是一位志愿军妈妈同文工团会见的故事。当文工团乘坐汽车走到平壤和开城之间的新幕的时候，停下来在路旁休息。这时，迎面来了一位朝鲜老大娘，急急忙忙地问：“你们是志愿军吗？”，文工团的同志们听不懂老大娘的话，只能着急地打手式。但老大娘却已从衣着和神态上认出了是她的中国儿女，于是不由分说就解开包袱，把包里的礼品送到文工团团员手中。
    原来这个老大娘是一个志愿军妈妈，战争时期为志愿军看护伤员、洗衣服……什么都做，她自己的当人民军的儿子有一次负了伤被志愿军救了。这位老大娘这一次是去看她的就要生第一胎的大女儿（刚才送给文工团员的礼品就是原来带给女儿的），路过新幕时听说文工团的同志们刚从新幕路过，她想，只要过去了就还会回来。她便决定在这里等着看看自己的中国儿女。一直等到第二天，她终于真的看到了久盼的中国亲人。……
    文艺工作团这次访问演出，遇见了许多朝鲜妈妈，妈妈们是多么渴念着中国儿女们哪！为救志愿军伤员牺牲了自己的生命的国际主义烈士朴在根的爱人为文工团员们带来了自己家养的蜂蜜，给他们喝蜜水，著名的志愿军妈妈具富力把她陪嫁的一套铜碗送给文工团，托他们转交给黄继光的妈妈邓芳芝，一个农业社的女社员把自己用了三十多年的铜面盆擦得通体晶亮，送给了女文工团团员化妆时用。黄海北道金川郡楠井里的曾看护过三十二个志愿军伤员的六十四岁的金妈妈和尹宇斗妈妈以及这个道新溪郡的金出仙老妈妈，都特意赶了二百多里路到沙里院来看文工团的演出，并给中国儿女们带来了人参和蜂蜜。文工团的同志也赠给各位妈妈绒毡等礼品，还把精致的“八一”纪念章挂在各位妈妈的胸前，留作纪念。
      在和平防线的前哨
    文艺工作团到守卫在东方和平前哨的朝鲜人民军各个队进行慰问演出时经受了世界上最亲密的战斗友谊的洗礼。人民军官兵们像迎接久别的亲密战友一样来迎接来自中国的文工团。他们用新沙铺修了通向营房的道路，在营房前用白色的石子排成“朝中友谊”的字样，当文工团同志到来的时候，整个部队都欢腾起来，各个部队的首长亲自出来迎接，人民军的军官和战士们争着把中国同志抬起来，走过整个欢迎的行列。文工团每逢演出完毕告别时，人们又依依惜别。文工团的一分团在人民军某部演出后乘车出发时，当地军民排了三、四里长的队伍冒着初冬的冷雨踏着泥泞夹道欢送，远远近近的山坡上和山头上也站着欢送的人群，欢呼“万岁”，人们握手又握手，拥抱又拥抱，客人们登车以后又有无数双手从车窗外伸进来，要同中国兄弟再亲一亲。汽车向前走了一段，又被不愿离别的人民军官兵和妇女们挡住车头，把车推回来，如此五次之多。宾主惜别的眼泪和雨水横流在一起，正如文工团团长王永年上校所说：“朝鲜人民军同志们的热情欢迎和我们内心的激动交流在一起，汇成了一个友谊欢乐的海洋，很像朝中兄弟部队并肩作战胜利会师的场面。”
    解放军文工团的同志为了同更多的亲人会见，差不多每天都演两场，即使白天乘车赶路，晚上一到地方立刻为朝鲜战友们组织演出，女歌唱家徐有光等还攀大山、越高岭到前哨阵地上慰问人民军战士们，为他们演出小型节目。有一个人民军的模范战士在听了徐有光的歌声以后激动地把自己胸前佩带的模范军人章摘下来，给徐有光佩戴胸前，他并告诉徐有光，从今后这支人民军部队的花名册上将留下徐有光的名字。在点名点到徐有光时，由全连最优秀的模范战士代徐有光应到。
    在朝鲜人民军的各个部队里，中国人民解放军文工团演出的小型舞剧“桥”受到特别的欢迎。这个舞剧表现一个志愿军战士和一个朝鲜老大娘互相掩护，炸毁了美军守卫着的一座桥，拦住了逃跑中的美军的去路的故事。许多人民军战士看了感动得掉了眼泪。有一次这个舞剧演出后，两个人民军战士含着眼泪激动地跑上台去，同扮演老大娘和志愿军战士的文工团演员艺兵和刘英紧紧拥抱，他们并且高呼：“我们一定要把美帝国主义赶出去”。另有一次，名叫明永三和金正银的两个人民军战士在看了演出以后，咬破了手指，用自己的鲜血在白纸上写上了“朝中友谊”四个大字，然后赠给了文工团的同志。
    这次中国人民解放军文艺工作团的访朝演出，和受到的欢迎，再一次显示了中朝两国人民间的以鲜血凝成的牢不可破的战斗友谊，在广大人民的心中深深地生根，随着岁月的推移，它将年复一年地开出更为美丽的花朵，结出更为丰硕的果实。（附图片）
