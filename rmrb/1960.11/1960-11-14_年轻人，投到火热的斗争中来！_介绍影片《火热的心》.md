  　Young People, Throw Yourselves into the Ardent Struggle!
    ——Introducing the Film "Ardent Hearts"
    Shen Jiyu
    The Soviet film "Ardent Hearts" is a story depicting the heroic labor and ardent struggles of steelworkers. The young people in the film, such as Fiya, Zhenya, Maiya, and Yasnova, are all characters with the spirit of the era of building a communist society. In order to shorten the tapping time and strive to accelerate the pace towards communism, they waged a sharp struggle against serious conservative and individualistic thinking. In this struggle, the communist labor enthusiasm, youthful ambition, love, and friendship of this group of young people, along with their youthful vitality and energetic spirit, are rhythmically interwoven into a moving and magnificent picture, as if taking us to the steel mill where "molten iron flows and steel sparks fly," making us feel joyful and happy to have met several lovely new young friends.
    The film "Ardent Hearts" focuses on depicting the common characteristics of the working class in its portrayal of steelworkers Fiya and Zhenya: a will as strong as steel and a personality as fiery as molten iron. This is the image of workers with communist consciousness.
    When Fiya appears in the film, we immediately feel that he is a lively and cheerful character. Fiya hurries back from the sanatorium on a freight train, inspired by the train driver's speeding, and when he jumps off the train, he shows a joyful expression as if he has found a treasure. When Yasnova notices that his coat is stained with soot, he answers with a hearty laugh:
  “It doesn't matter, the price is worth it!” These concise descriptions at the beginning of the film clearly outline Fiya's simple temperament and spirit of inquiry, making us feel as if we are welcoming a long-lost friend, feeling incredibly kind and excited...
    After Fiya returns to the factory and proposes an initiative to improve steelmaking operations, it is as if a huge stone has been thrown into a calm river, suddenly stirring up waves. Because Fiya's initiative is supported by advanced workers, it is obstructed and coldly received by the workshop director, Savchuk, who is deeply afraid of disrupting the "routine" of life; at the same time, it arouses the opposition and jealousy of "engineer" Strelnikov, who opposes and provokes from the sidelines; to the point that Fiya and the workers have to secretly experiment behind their backs, but unfortunately, an accident occurs – running steel scalds Zhenya's eyes, and the experiment fails. At this point, the plot turns into a sudden change and pushes towards a climax, causing us to feel regret for the failure of Fiya's experiment and concern for Zhenya's injury. Here, at the same time, we foresee that two sharply opposed ideological contradictions will surge and collide like raging waves.
    Next, the film further portrays Fiya's distinct personality, showing the working class's confidence and fearless spirit in the face of difficulties. Seeing that the experiment has failed and an accident has occurred, Fiya's heart is as uncomfortable as if it is being fueled by fire; he is summoned by the workshop director, Savchuk, for questioning and punished by being sent to sweep garbage; and he is subjected to malicious ridicule and retaliation by the ulterior motives of Strelnikov. Can all this overwhelm Fiya's strong will? Can it extinguish Fiya's fiery enthusiasm? No. Fiya has not the slightest discouragement or wavering. On the contrary, he gathers greater confidence and courage, and decides to find helpers to see it through to the end! In Fiya's determination and actions, it can be seen that he possesses infinite energy and tenacious drive; he does not care about personal honor or disgrace, and is single-mindedly determined to fight for increased steel production. The film puts Fiya in this specific environment, and like a piece of gold, the more he is tempered, the more dazzling his brilliance becomes; his excellent qualities are revealed more deeply.
    The film successfully portrays the image of Party Secretary Grachev. We see that Grachev promptly investigates the truth of the accident, criticizes Savchuk's conservative thinking, and helps him recognize his mistakes and change. Grachev encourages Fiya and his colleagues to make persistent efforts and fully exploit the initiative and creativity of the masses, which finally leads to the success of Fiya's experiment.
    The film also successfully portrays the young worker Zhenya. When Fiya proposes the initiative to shorten the tapping time, Zhenya is the first to respond with enthusiastic support, and Zhenya actively participates in the experiment. He deeply understands how great a contribution this experiment will be to communist construction once it succeeds! When the experiment fails and his eyes are scalded, Zhenya is not intimidated and does not retreat. On the contrary, he attributes the responsibility for the accident entirely to himself; when he is lying in the hospital, he still cannot forget the experiment and questions Savchuk about why he adopted a cold and indifferent attitude towards the experiment. At this time, Zhenya's eyes are still bandaged, and it is difficult for the actor to convey the character's excited mood through facial expressions; however, through Zhenya's confession to the nurse, Dasha: "Oh, Aunt Dasha, you have no feelings for steel. You must know that everything is made of steel. The spacecraft in the sky, we fly to Mars, the Moon, and Venus..." From this sonorous metallic voice, it seems that we can hear his heart beating rapidly. What an ardent heart this is. Zhenya is such a young worker who loves labor, loves life, and has great ideals!
    Although the film's description of Fiya's younger sister, Maiya, is relatively simple, it expresses her childish and lively personality, her strong will that is not afraid of difficulties, and her excellent qualities of loving the cause of communist construction through two wonderful scenes. When Maiya graduates from middle school and receives a first-class diploma, her father is wholeheartedly thinking of sending her to college, hoping that she will become a scholar in the future. However, Maiya does not covet personal fame and fortune. At this time, she is determined to take pride in being a worker and has already closely integrated her personal ideals with communist construction. Therefore, Maiya asks her father, Shebalin, a question that is full of humor: "The Shebalin's father and son are steelworkers, but they only want their daughter to go to college. Why should I destroy our family's tradition?" In this short and loud answer, how much Maiya loves the glorious tradition of her ancestors being workers, how much she longs to become a member of the working class. With Zhenya's encouragement, she quickly becomes a worker at the steel mill. Maiya is such a girl who strides forward towards life and treats life like a flame. In another scene, when Zhenya is injured in an accident, Maiya is more concerned and takes care of Zhenya than before, and expresses fiery enthusiasm: "I love you more than before..." Here we see Maiya's new spiritual outlook, her heart appears as transparent and pure as crystal, how high her ideological realm is! After Zhenya recovers from his injuries, they establish deeper roots of love in their joint labor.
    From the young people like Fiya, Zhenya, and Maiya, we see their high-spirited fighting spirit for building communism and their infinite love and longing for today and tomorrow. Young people, let us all throw ourselves into the ardent struggle of socialist-communist construction!

  　年轻人，投到火热的斗争中来！
    ——介绍影片《火热的心》
    沈基宇
    苏联影片《火热的心》是描写炼钢工人的英勇劳动和火热斗争的故事。菲佳、热尼亚、麦娅和亚斯诺娃这几个年轻人，都是具有建设共产主义社会的时代色彩的人物。他们为了把出钢的时间缩短，争取加快速度向共产主义迈进，对严重的保守思想和个人主义思想进行了尖锐的斗争。在这场斗争中，这群年轻人的共产主义的劳动热情，年轻人的雄心壮志、爱情和友谊，和他们的青春活力以及充沛的干劲，有节奏地交织成一幅动人而壮丽的画面，仿佛把我们带到“铁水奔流，钢花飞溅”的钢铁厂，使我们为结识了几个可爱的年轻的新朋友而感到喜悦和高兴。
    影片《火热的心》对炼钢工人菲佳和热尼亚的描写，着重地刻划了他们作为工人阶级的共同特征：像钢铁一样坚强的意志，像炉水一样火热的性格，这是具有共产主义觉悟的工人形象。
    菲佳在影片里出现时，就使我们感到他是一个生气勃勃、性格开朗的人物。菲佳从休养地匆匆搭着货车回来，从火车司机超速运载中得到启示，因此当他跳下车时，显出了如获至宝的喜悦神情。当亚斯诺娃发现他的上衣沾了煤烟，他却是爽朗地笑着回答：
  “没关系，这代价花的值得啊！”影片开头这几笔简练的描写，把菲佳朴素的气质和钻研的精神很清晰地勾划出来，使我们好像迎接到久别远归的知友，感到无比的亲切和兴奋……
    菲佳回到工厂提出改进炼钢操作方法的倡议后，简直像一块巨石投入平静的河面上，突然激起了一片片的波澜。因为菲佳的倡议获得了先进工人的拥护和支持，却又遭到车间主任萨弗丘克的阻挠和冷淡，萨弗丘克深怕打乱生活“常规”；同时又引起“工程师”斯特列力尼科夫的反对和忌恨，从中加以反对和挑拨；以至于菲佳和工人们不得不背着他们偷偷试验，但不幸出了事故——跑钢烫伤了热尼亚的眼睛，试验失败了。这时，剧情转入急遽的变化而推向高潮，引起我们对菲佳他们试验失败而感到惋惜，对热尼亚的受伤而感到关切。在这里，同时使我们预感到两种尖锐对立的思想矛盾，将会像汹涌奔腾的波涛冲击激荡起来。
    接着，影片进一步刻划着菲佳的鲜明个性，表现出工人阶级的信心和在困难面前无畏的气概。菲佳眼看试验失败又出了事故，他的心像火上加油似的难受；他招来车间主任萨弗丘克的责难，受到去打扫垃圾的处罚；又遭到别有用心的斯特列力尼科夫的恶意嘲笑和报复，这一切难道就能压倒菲佳的坚强意志吗？就能浇灭菲佳的火样热情吗？不会的。菲佳没有丝毫的灰心和动摇，相反地，他却鼓起更大的信心和勇气，决定再找帮人干到底！在菲佳的决心和行动中，看得出在他身上蕴藏着无穷的精力、顽强的干劲；他不计较个人的荣辱得失，一心只为钢的增产坚持斗争。影片把菲佳放在这样特定的环境里，他像一块金子一样，越加磨砺，就越显出它耀眼的光辉；把他的优秀品质更深刻地揭示出来了。
    影片成功地塑造了党委书记格拉乔夫的形象，我们看到格拉乔夫及时查明了事故的真相，批评了萨弗丘克的保守思想，并帮助他认识错误而转变过来；格拉乔夫鼓励菲佳他们再接再厉，充分发挥了群众的积极性和创造性，终于使菲佳的试验获得成功。
    影片同样成功地塑造了热尼亚这个年轻工人的典型。当菲佳提出缩短出钢时间的倡议，是热尼亚首先报以热烈的支持，是热尼亚积极参加了这个试验。他深深懂得这个试验一旦成功，对共产主义建设是一个多大的贡献！当试验失败烫伤了自己的眼睛时，热尼亚并没有被吓倒而退却下来，反而把事故的责任完全归于自己；当他躺在医院里，还是对试验念念不忘，质问萨弗丘克为什么对试验采取冷淡旁观的态度。这时，热尼亚的眼睛仍包着绷带，演员在这时已很难用眼部表情传达出角色的激动心情；可是影片通过热尼亚对护士达莎的表白：“唉，达莎大婶，您跟钢铁没有感情啊。您要知道，什么都是钢做的。上天的宇宙飞船，咱们飞上火星、月球、还有金星……”我们从这铿锵金属般的声音里，好像倾听到他的心在急剧跳动，这是一颗多么火热的心。热尼亚，就是这样一个热爱劳动，热爱生活，而具有远大理想的年轻工人！
    影片对菲佳的妹妹麦娅的描写虽然比较简单，但通过两场精彩的戏，表现出她那种带有稚气而活泼爽朗的性格，那种不怕困难的坚强意志，以及热爱共产主义建设事业的优秀品质。当麦娅从中学毕业获得甲级奖状时，父亲一心想让她上大学，希望她将来当个学者。可是麦娅不贪图个人的名利，这时，她已立志以做个工人引以为荣，已经把个人的理想紧紧地与共产主义建设溶合在一起了。所以麦娅对父亲舍巴林提出了这样富有风趣的质问：“舍巴林的父子都炼钢，单叫女儿上大学。为什么我要破坏我们家的传统哪？”在这个简短的响亮的回答里，麦娅多么热爱祖辈是工人阶级的光荣传统，她是多么渴望成为工人阶级的一员。在热尼亚的鼓励下，她也很快地成为炼钢厂的工人了。麦娅就是这样一个大踏步向生活前进，像一团烈火般对待生活的姑娘。在另一场戏里，当热尼亚因事故受伤时，麦娅对热尼亚比前更加关切和照顾，并且表现了火似的热情：“我比以前更爱你……”在这里让我们看到了麦娅新的精神面貌，她的心灵显出像水晶般那样透明和纯洁，她的思想境界是多么高啊！当热尼亚受伤恢复以后，他们在共同劳动中扎下更深的爱情根苗了。
    从菲佳、热尼亚和麦娅这群年轻人的身上，使我们看到了他们建设共产主义的昂扬斗志，对今天和明天的无限热爱和向往。年轻人，让我们都投到社会主义—共产主义建设的火热的斗争中来！
