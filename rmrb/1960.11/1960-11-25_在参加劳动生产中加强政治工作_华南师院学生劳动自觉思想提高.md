Strengthen Political Work in Participating in Labor Production
Hua Nan Normal University Students Improve Their Awareness of Labor

    (Our report) Hua Nan Normal University, in the process of arranging students to participate in various forms of production labor, has continuously strengthened political and ideological work, enabling students to consciously participate in labor and transform their thinking. This has not only resulted in significant achievements in production, but has also greatly improved their ideological awareness, marking a major step forward on the path of intellectual laborization.
    The Hua Nan Normal University Party Committee has particularly strengthened specific leadership of political and ideological work when arranging for students to participate in labor. Each time students are organized to go to the countryside or factories for longer periods of labor, leading cadres of the university Party committee or the various departments' Party organizations participate with the students, engaging in both production labor and ideological work. The school's Party and Youth League organizations also play a combat role in production labor. In addition to taking the lead in labor, Party and Youth League members are responsible for doing ideological work among the students around them. Political teachers also work alongside the students, promptly helping them resolve ideological problems. When students participate in daily labor at the factories and farms run by the university, the Party and Youth League organizations also regard educating students on the laborization of intellectuals as an important task.
    In strengthening students' political and ideological education, the Party and Youth League organizations of Hua Nan Normal University pay attention to educating students to gradually establish a labor viewpoint and develop labor habits based on the production tasks of each period and the students' ideological trends and labor performance. According to the university's arrangements, first-year students mainly participate in farm production in the various departments within the university and regularly go to the countryside to support agricultural production; second-year students mainly participate in basic construction labor within the university and production at the university's main farm; and third- and fourth-year students go to factories and rural areas inside and outside the university for labor in conjunction with their major or scientific research. At the beginning, in response to the situation where some people were willing to do industrial work but not agricultural work, and willing to do technical labor but not general labor, the Party and Youth League branches organized discussions on questions such as "What is labor for?" and "How does the working class treat labor?" to criticize ideas that looked down on agricultural labor and physical labor. At the same time, students were organized to visit people's communes and factories, and hold forums with workers and peasants. After going to the countryside and factories, they were continuously educated with vivid examples of workers' and peasants' selfless labor and hard work. Encouraged by the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, the students consciously changed their attitude toward labor and eagerly took on heavy work in industrial and agricultural production, striving to participate in labor and training in the most difficult places. In August of this year, the university Party committee organized more than 800 teachers and students to Qingyuan County to support farmers in expanding planting and rush-transplanting. The students were highly motivated and transplanted more than 1,300 mu of rice in two weeks, in addition to harvesting rice and expanding planting by more than 300 mu. Recently, in the university's large-scale campaign to reclaim wasteland and expand planting and vigorously develop sideline production, the Party and Youth League organizations of various departments have also educated students to inherit and carry forward the Nanniwan spirit of hard work and struggle in production labor by inviting veteran revolutionaries to tell the story of the Nanniwan production struggle and carrying out activities such as "Youth League Member Day." The labor enthusiasm of the students throughout the university has been high, and in more than a month, they have reclaimed more than 80 mu of wasteland, planting vegetables, sweet potatoes and other crops on all the open and barren land in the university. Now, the students regard labor as equally important as learning, and have developed relatively solid labor habits. After class and meals, they automatically go to the vegetable and sweet potato fields to work. On weekends and holidays, they go to nearby people's communes in groups to support agricultural production.
    The Hua Nan Normal University Party organization also frequently educates students to serve the workers and peasants wholeheartedly and learn from the workers and peasants humbly when going to the countryside and factories. Each time they go to the countryside and factories, the Party organization requires the students to eat, live, labor, and consult with the workers and peasants. When students from the Chinese Department participated in agricultural production in the Wenchong Brigade of the Huangpu Commune in the suburbs last year, they used their rest time to visit farmers and make friends with them. Now, the students of this department have established a deep affection with the farmers of the Wenchong Brigade. The farmers often come to the university to visit them, and when they encounter the busy farming season, the students automatically go to support the farmers on Sundays.
    In order to improve students' understanding of the countryside and establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation, the Party and Youth League branches of the Chinese Department and the Political Education Department also organize students to participate in production labor in the countryside and factories, while combining what they have learned to conduct social surveys comparing rural life before and after liberation and before and after the Great Leap Forward; students of the History Department also conduct revolutionary history surveys in connection with labor. Students who went to Qingyuan Jintan Commune to support agriculture learned in their survey and visits that this commune, established only a year ago, had seen many miracles that had never happened in history, and they truly experienced the superiority of the people's commune! Cen Shujin, a female student in the third grade of the History Department, climbed high mountains and ridges to visit revolutionary masses and collect revolutionary historical sites when she labored in Nanxiong County. In the process of investigation and visits, she was deeply moved by the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses who worked hard and struggled, and she was determined to apply to be assigned there as a teacher after graduation to dedicate her knowledge and strength to the people in the mountainous area.

    在参加劳动生产中加强政治工作
    华南师院学生劳动自觉思想提高
    本报讯　华南师范学院在安排学生参加各种生产劳动的过程中，不断加强政治思想工作，使学生自觉地参加劳动和改造思想，不仅在生产中做出显著成绩，而且大大提高思想觉悟，在知识分子劳动化的道路上迈进了一大步。
    华南师范学院党委在安排学生参加劳动时，特别加强政治思想工作的具体领导。在每次组织学生下乡、下厂参加较长期的劳动时，学院党委或各系党组织负责干部都和学生一起，一面参加生产劳动，一面抓思想工作。学校的党、团组织，也在生产劳动中发挥战斗作用，党、团员除了带头劳动外，都负责做好周围学生的思想工作。政治教师则跟班劳动，及时帮助学生解决思想问题。学生日常在院办的工厂、农场参加劳动时，党、团组织也把对学生进行知识分子劳动化的教育，作为一项重要任务。
    在加强学生的政治思想教育中，华南师范学院的党、团组织都注意根据各个时期的生产任务和学生的思想动向、劳动表现，教育学生逐步树立劳动观点和养成劳动习惯。根据学院的安排，一年级学生主要是参加院内各系农场生产和定期集中下乡支援农业生产；二年级主要参加院内基本建设劳动和学院总农场生产，三、四年级则结合专业或科学研究，到院内院外的工厂、农村劳动。在开始时，针对一些人愿干工业活不愿干农业活，愿搞技术劳动不愿搞一般劳动的情况，党、团支部组织开展关于“劳动为了什么？”“工人阶级是怎样对待劳动的”等问题的讨论，批判轻视农业劳动、轻视体力劳动的思想。同时组织学生到人民公社和工厂参观访问，和工人、农民举行座谈。下乡下厂后又不断以工人、农民忘我劳动、艰苦奋斗的生动事例来教育他们。学生们受到工人、农民冲天干劲的鼓舞，自觉地改变劳动态度，在工、农业生产中都抢着干重活、争着到最艰苦的地方参加劳动锻炼。今年8月间，学院党委组织八百多师生到清远县支援农民扩种抢插，学生们积极性很高，两周内就插秧一千三百多亩，另外割稻、扩种三百多亩。最近学院在院内大搞开荒扩种，大搞副业生产运动中，各系的党、团组织又通过邀请革命老前辈讲述南泥湾生产斗争的故事，开展“共青团员日”等活动，教育学生在生产劳动中继承和发扬南泥湾的艰苦奋斗精神，全院学生劳动热情高涨，在一个多月内就开荒八十多亩，将全院空地荒地都种上了蔬菜、番薯等作物。现在，同学们已经把劳动看得与学习同等重要，养成了比较牢固的劳动习惯。课余饭后，就自动到菜地薯地干活。星期天假日，还成群结队到附近的人民公社支援农业生产。
    华南师范学院党组织还经常教育学生在下乡下厂中，全心全意为工农群众服务，虚心向工农群众学习。每次下乡下厂，党组织都要求学生们做到和工人、农民同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。中文系的学生去年到郊区黄埔公社文冲大队参加农业生产时，大家利用休息时间访问农民，和农民交朋友。现在，这个系的学生已经和文冲大队的农民建立了深厚的感情，农民经常来院探望他们，碰到农忙季节，学生就自动在星期天去支援农民。
    为了提高学生对农村的认识，树立以农业为基础的思想，中文系、政治教育系的党、团支部还组织学生在下乡下厂中一面参加生产劳动，一面结合所学专业进行解放前后、大跃进前后农村生活对比的社会调查；历史系的学生也结合劳动进行革命史调查。到清远浸潭公社支援农业的学生，在调查访问中了解到这个公社成立仅一年，就出现了许多历史上所没有过的奇迹，他们真正体会到人民公社的优越性！历史系三年级女学生岑淑金，到南雄县劳动时，曾爬过高山峻岭去访问革命群众，收集革命史迹，在调查访问过程中，她深为革命群众艰苦奋斗的革命精神所感动，决心在毕业后请求分配到那里当教师，把自己的知识和力量献给山区的人民。　（岑荔丹）（附图片）
