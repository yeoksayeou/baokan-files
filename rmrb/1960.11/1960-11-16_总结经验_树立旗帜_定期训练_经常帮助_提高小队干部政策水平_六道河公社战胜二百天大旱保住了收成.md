Reported by this newspaper: The Liudaohe Commune Party Committee in Xinglong County, Hebei Province, adopted effective measures to conscientiously improve the leadership and policy level of small team cadres, giving full play to the fighting role of the small teams, overcoming the severe drought, and preserving the harvest.

    Dissecting "Sparrows" to Summarize Experience

    This commune has ninety-one production teams. In 1959, most teams increased production, but twenty-two teams experienced a decrease. To find the reasons and learn from the lessons, members of the commune Party committee went to both increasing and decreasing production teams to "dissect sparrows." Through typical investigations, it was found that there were three types of reasons for the reduction in production: first, the leadership of the small team was in the hands of rich middle peasants, and the Party's various policies were not well implemented; second, some small teams lacked leading backbone, failing to form a strong leadership core; and third, some small team cadres, although loyal to the Party's cause and diligently working in production, had low policy levels and lacked working methods. In contrast to the situation in the decreasing production teams, the most important reason for the increased production in the increasing production teams was the better implementation of policies, which were implemented promptly, specifically, and thoroughly.

    Improving the Leadership Core of Small Teams

    Through typical investigations, the commune Party committee deeply realized that to run the people's commune well, it is necessary to improve the policy level of the small team cadres. To solve this problem, the commune Party committee first started by strengthening the Party's leadership and giving full play to the role of Party and League members in the small teams. The Party小组长 (xiaozu zhang or group leader) is generally the production team leader or deputy leader. With them as the core, they absorb work group leaders and enthusiastic, progressive old peasants and young people to form the small team's team affairs committee. Now, among the team affairs committee members of all ninety-one teams in the commune, poor and lower-middle peasants account for 75%, and lower-middle peasants account for 10%.

    Establishing Banners, Learning From and Catching Up With Pace-Setters

    Widely establishing pace-setters and carrying out the learn, catch up, and surpass movement is also an important aspect of improving small team cadres. First, Li Xiufa, the small team leader of Erdaohe, was established as a pace-setter. Li Xiufa's advantages are: firm class stand, conscientious study and implementation of the Party's policies; democratic style, good at following the mass line; skillful use of labor, enabling the small team to increase production year after year; and constant attention to arranging the livelihood of commune members. When the commune Party committee organized small team cadres to learn from Li Xiufa, it guided everyone to seriously compare themselves and clarify their learning goals. Li Fengzhi, the small team leader of Nantai Zi, used to have simple working methods and did not conscientiously implement policies. After learning Li Xiufa's leadership experience, she made great changes.

    Promoting the "Five-Character Method"

    The commune Party committee also adopted the "cultivate," "send," "lead," "summarize," and "teach" five-character working method in its organization, making the improvement of small team leadership a regular leadership system. "Cultivate" means to train small team cadres in a planned and step-by-step manner. Since this spring, one hundred and thirty production team leaders have been trained. The training methods are flexible and varied, including short-term training classes and on-site experience exchange meetings. In addition, the commune's four secretaries and four directors each cultivated a typical small team. This enriched the commune's leadership experience and specifically trained cadres. "Send" refers to sending people in and sending people out. Sending people in means that the commune Party committee secretary, director, and brigade branch secretary and captain all serve as deputy positions in the small teams to specifically help the small team cadres in their work; sending people out means organizing small team cadres to go to advanced small teams to "study abroad." "Lead" means taking on apprentices. Commune cadres and brigade cadres, after going down to the small teams, explain policies and working methods to the small team cadres, and then set an example for them to see. "Summarize" means helping the small teams summarize their work. "Teach" means conducting political and cultural education for all small team leaders. Now, all ninety-one small team cadres in the commune have broken the superstition that they dare not study theory, and fifteen of the more than thirty illiterate small team leaders have basically shed their illiteracy.

    Because the commune Party committee paid attention to cultivating and improving the leadership level of small team cadres, they have greatly improved in their thinking, working methods, and work style. Most small team cadres are able to promptly implement the Party's line and policies among the masses, and a new atmosphere of happy commune members and advancing production has emerged. This year, the commune encountered a severe drought with more than two hundred days without soaking rain, but the total grain output is still no less than last year.

    提高小队干部政策水平
    六道河公社战胜二百天大旱保住了收成
    本报讯　河北兴隆县六道河公社党委采取有效措施，认真提高小队干部的领导水平和政策水平，充分发挥小队的战斗作用，战胜了大旱，保住收成。
    解剖“麻雀”总结经验
    这个公社有九十一个生产小队。1959年大部分小队增了产，但有二十二个小队却减了产。为了找出原因，吸取教训，公社党委委员分头深入增产和减产小队“解剖麻雀”。通过典型调查发现，减产情况有三种：一是小队的领导权掌握在富裕中农手里，党的各项政策没有很好贯彻；二是有些小队领导骨干少，形不成坚强的领导核心；三是有些小队干部虽然对党的事业忠心耿耿，在生产中埋头苦干，但政策水平低，工作办法少。和减产小队的情况相反，增产小队获得增产的最主要原因，是执行政策较好，贯彻政策及时、具体和深透。
    健全小队领导核心
    通过典型调查，使公社党委深刻地认识到，要办好人民公社，必须提高小队干部的政策水平。为了解决这个问题，公社党委首先从加强党的领导，充分发挥小队中党、团员作用着手。党的小组长一般都是生产小队长或副队长，以他们为主，吸收作业组长和对农业热心、思想进步的老农、青年，组成小队队务委员会。现在，全社九十一个小队的队务委员，贫雇农占75％，下中农占10％。
    树立旗帜　学赶标兵
    广树标兵，开展了学、赶、超运动，也是提高小队干部的一个重要方面。首先树立了二道河小队长李秀发为标兵，李秀发的优点是：阶级立场坚定，认真学习和贯彻党的政策；作风民主，善于走群众路线；巧使劳力，使小队连年增产；经常注意安排社员生活。公社党委在组织小队干部学习李秀发时，引导大家认真对照自己，明确学习目标。南台子小队长李凤芝过去工作方法简单，不认真贯彻政策，学习了李秀发的领导经验之后，有了很大的转变。
    推行“五字法”
    公社党委还在组织上采取了“培”、“派”、“带”、“总”、“教”的五字工作方法，使提高小队领导水平成为经常的领导制度。“培”，就是有计划有步骤地培训小队干部。从今春以来，已培训了生产小队长一百三十名。培养的方法机动灵活，有短期训练班，有现场经验交流会。此外，公社四名书记、四名社长，每人都培养一个典型小队。这样一来既丰富了公社领导经验，又具体培养了干部。“派”，是派进来和派出去。派进来，是公社党委书记、社长和大队支书、队长都到小队任副职，具体帮助小队干部工作；派出去，是组织小队干部到工作先进的小队去“留学”。“带”，就是带徒弟。公社干部、大队干部下去后，给小队干部讲政策，讲工作方法，然后自己再作出样子叫他们看。“总”，就是帮助小队总结工作。“教”，就是对各小队长进行政治、文化教育。现在全社九十一个小队的干部都打破了不敢学理论的迷信思想，三十多名文盲小队长已有十五人基本上摘掉了文盲帽子。
    由于公社党委注意培养提高小队干部的领导水平，使他们在思想上、工作方法上和工作作风上都大大提高了一步。大部分小队干部能够把党的方针政策及时地贯彻到群众中去，出现了社员心情舒畅，生产跃进的新气象。今年，这个社遇到了二百多天没有下透雨的严重干旱，但是粮食总产量仍不低于去年。
