Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 21st: North Vietnam's factories, mines, enterprises, government offices, troops, and schools have launched a movement to support agriculture.

According to Vietnamese newspapers, in order to adapt to the needs of agricultural collectivization and collective production, North Vietnam's factories, mines, and enterprises, under the specific guidance of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, have generally formulated plans to support winter and spring agricultural production. The main content of factories and mines supporting agriculture is to make every effort to manufacture agricultural machinery and new farm tools. Factories and mines with the conditions should establish ties with agricultural cooperatives, help agricultural cooperatives repair farm tools for a long time, train technical cadres, and transfer manpower to support cooperatives during the busy farming season. In the past month, hundreds of enterprises and agricultural cooperatives in the north have established long-term contacts. One hundred and thirteen enterprises in Haiphong have supplied a large number of water conservancy machinery, fertilizers, scrap iron, and cash to one hundred and seventeen suburban agricultural cooperatives to support winter and spring agricultural production.

Commercial and supply and marketing departments also started supplying cattle, farm tools, and fertilizers to rural areas earlier this year. Supply and marketing cooperatives plan to supply 5,500 cattle, more than 1 million farm tools, and 63,000 tons of chemical fertilizers to rural areas this winter and next spring. At present, 62% of the plan to supply cattle has been completed, and the supply of farm tools and chemical fertilizers is also earlier and faster than in previous years. When supplying rice transplanters and new farm tools to rural areas, supply and marketing cooperatives in Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and other provinces also held exhibitions and comparative performances of new and old farm tools to impart technology to farmers.

In addition to using small plots of land to grow vegetables, raise chickens, and raise fish, government offices, troops, and schools in the north generally transfer manpower to support rural areas. High and middle schools in Nam Dinh province have generally formulated long-term plans for accumulating fertilizer and manufacturing farm tools, turning support for agriculture into a regular task for teachers and students.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest: The Hungarian "People's Freedom Daily" published on the 17th the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government's decision on new methods for the state to support, strengthen, and develop the economy of agricultural production cooperatives in 1961.

The resolution pointed out that the government will continue to regard making agricultural production cooperatives into advanced and modern large-scale agricultural enterprises in terms of organization and economy as the most important task as soon as possible.

The resolution called on all production cooperatives to make the most of their own strength. The government will gradually implement the principle of providing support according to the size of the cooperative's own strength.

The resolution stipulates that the government will continue to help agricultural cooperatives purchase seeds and maintain machinery with loans of eight to ten years, and will support cooperatives in developing water conservancy projects in many ways.

In 1961, the government will also strengthen agricultural cooperatives in various places with 1,000 agronomists and accountants.

The resolution said that in the future, the mechanization of cooperatives will mainly be completed by machine stations. However, the government will allow cooperatives to purchase agricultural machinery, and will provide cooperatives with loans of six to eight years for the purchase of tractors and other agricultural machinery. New cooperatives or cooperatives with a large increase in arable land will receive preferential treatment in terms of expenses when using the machines of machine stations.

The resolution said that the state will help cooperatives develop vegetable and fruit production, and called on all cooperatives to increase livestock products by utilizing the possible conditions for raising livestock on private plots while rapidly developing collective livestock raising.

The resolution attached great importance to the development of processing factories and other cooperative enterprises by cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw: According to Polish newspapers, the Polish Ministry of Agriculture has decided to send a large number of agronomists to the countryside so that in the next few years, each village will have an agronomist or agricultural technician settling there.

The Polish Agricultural Team Alliance sent more than 200 agronomists to rural areas this year, and plans to send 1,000 agronomists and 500 animal husbandry technicians next year. According to the initial plan of the agricultural sector, by 1965, there will be 6,440 agronomists going to the countryside, so that each village will have an agronomist. At the same time, the number of animal husbandry technicians working in rural areas will be increased to 3,000, and the number of veterinarians will be increased to 6,400.

At present, there are 3,500 agronomists and agricultural technicians working in rural areas in Poland, and 2,730 agronomists working in state-owned farms. Together with other agricultural technicians, there are a total of 13,000 agricultural technicians directly involved in production.

During the period of the people's regime, the state has trained more than 39,000 higher and secondary agricultural technical personnel.

The agricultural sector has also decided to establish agrotechnical center stations in each village. (Photo attached)

    越南北方广泛开展支援农业运动
    匈牙利政府决定以人力物力支持农业合作社发展经济  波兰农业部决定派大批农业技术人员到乡村中定居
    新华社河内21日电　越南北方各厂矿企业、机关、部队和学校展开了支援农业的运动。
    据越南报纸报道，为了适应农业合作化集体生产的需要，越南北方各厂矿企业在重工业部的具体指导下，普遍制订支援农村冬春生产的计划。厂矿企业支援农业的主要内容是，尽一切努力制造农业机械和新式农具，有条件的厂矿同农业合作社挂钩，长期帮助农业合作社修理农具，培养技术干部，并且在农忙时抽调人力支援合作社。近一个月来，全北方已有数百个企业单位和农业合作社挂钩，建立了长期联系。海防市一百一十三个企业单位已供给一百一十七个郊区农业合作社大批水利机械、肥料、废铁和现款，支援农业合作社冬春生产。
    商业、供销部门今年也提前开始供应农村耕牛、农具和肥料。供销合作社计划今冬明春供应农村五千五百头耕牛，一百多万件农具和六万三千吨化肥。现在，供应耕牛的计划已经完成62％，农具、化肥的供应也比往年又早又快。清化、宜安等省供销合作社在供应农村插秧机和新农具时，还举办了展览会和新旧农具对比表演，向农民传授技术。
    北方各机关、部队和学校除利用小块土地种植蔬菜，养鸡养鱼以外，一般都抽调人力支援农村。南定省高、中级学校普遍订出积肥、制造农具的长期计划，把支援农业变成学校师生的经常任务。
    新华社布达佩斯电　匈牙利“人民自由报”17日刊登了匈牙利工农革命政府关于国家在1961年支持、加强和发展农业生产合作社经济的新办法的决议。
    决议指出，政府今后将继续把尽早使农业生产合作社变为在组织上和经济上先进的现代化大型农业企业当作最重要的任务。
    决议号召各生产合作社必需尽可能地利用自己的力量。政府将逐步实现按照合作社本身力量的大小给予支持的原则。
    决议规定，政府将以八到十年的贷款继续帮助农业合作社购买种子和保养机器，并将多方面地支援合作社发展水利事业。
    在1961年，政府还将以一千名农艺师和会计员来加强各地农业合作社。
    决议说，今后合作社的机械化工作主要仍由机器站完成。但是政府将允许合作社购买农业机器，并在购买拖拉机和其它一些农业机器方面给予合作社六至八年的贷款。新社或耕地面积大量增加的合作社在使用机器站的机器时，在费用上将得到优待。
    决议说，国家将帮助合作社发展蔬菜和水果生产，并号召各合作社在快速发展集体饲养牲畜的同时，要利用自留地上饲养牲畜的可能条件来增加畜产品。
    决议对合作社发展加工工厂和其它合作社企业给予了很大的重视。
    新华社华沙电　据波兰报刊报道，波兰农业部决定派遣大批农学家下乡，以便在最近几年内，使每个乡村有一个农艺师或农业技术员在那里定居。
    波兰农业小组联盟今年派遣了二百多名农艺师到农村，明年准备派遣一千名农艺师和五百名畜牧技术员。根据农业部门的初步计划，到1965年，将有六千四百四十名农艺师下乡，使每个乡村有一个农学家，同时，使在农村工作的畜牧技术员的数目增加到三千名，兽医增至六千四百名。
    目前，波兰共有三千五百名农艺师和农业技术员在农村工作，二千七百三十名农学家在国营农场工作。再加上其它农业技术人员，直接参预生产的农业技术人员共有一万三千人。
    在人民政权期间，国家共培养了三万九千多名高等和中等农业技术人材。
    农业部门还决定在每个乡村建立农艺中心站。（附图片）
