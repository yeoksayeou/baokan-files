Xinhua News Agency, November 27th, Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower replied on November 25th to a telegram from President Sékou Touré of the Republic of Guinea, strenuously defending the U.S.'s interference in the Congo's internal affairs and insisting that the U.S. continue to push its conspiracy to swallow the Congo using the United Nations. In the telegram, he even counter-attacked, accusing those countries that opposed the U.S. manipulating the United Nations General Assembly to allow Kasavubu's representative to usurp the seat of the legitimate Congolese government in the United Nations of taking a so-called "biased attitude."

Eisenhower was responding to a telegram sent to him by Sékou Touré on November 20th. In that telegram, Touré accused the U.S. of taking a biased stance in the Congo situation and demanded that the U.S. stop supporting the enemies of African liberation. The White House released the content of Eisenhower's reply to Touré on November 26th. In the reply, Eisenhower even stubbornly claimed that Touré's telegram "reflected a serious misunderstanding of the U.S. government's policy of supporting African freedom." The reply attempted to conceal the U.S.'s role in plotting divisive activities in the Congo and the fact that the U.S. was interfering in the Congo's internal affairs under the banner of the United Nations, stubbornly portraying this U.S. policy as "recognizing and maintaining its [the Congo's] unity and territorial integrity."

Eisenhower also described the U.S.'s actions in supporting Kasavubu and being hostile to the legitimate Lumumba government as one of the "necessary foundations for the United States to try to strengthen stability and effective government in that unfortunate country." Eisenhower stated in the letter that the U.S. would continue to use the United Nations to interfere in the Congo. He insisted that the "success" of the United Nations in the Congo was "extremely important" and even demanded that Touré give "full support to the United Nations' efforts there."

According to Xinhua News Agency, in order to stir up discord among Africans, the U.S. is making every effort to exaggerate the conflict between the "UN forces" and the Congolese army into a conflict between Ghana and the Congo. On the 22nd, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Wadsworth, impatiently declared at the United Nations General Assembly that if Ghana "accepted" Mobutu's illegal "expulsion order," "the violent actions would never have occurred." He even said that the U.S. expressed "regret" that the Ghanaian government had failed to comply with "Congo's" request to withdraw Nkrumah's "personal" representative in Leopoldville, Welbeck.

    艾森豪威尔复电杜尔总统
    极力为美国干涉刚果的罪行辩解  坚持利用联合国鲸吞刚果的阴谋
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔25日复电几内亚共和国总统塞古·杜尔，极力为美国干涉刚果内政辩解，坚持美国要继续推行利用联合国鲸吞刚果的阴谋。他在电报里还反咬一口，攻击那些反对美国操纵联合国大会，使卡萨武布的代表篡夺刚果合法政府在联合国的席位的国家是采取了所谓“偏袒态度”。
    艾森豪威尔是答复塞古·杜尔11月20日打给他的电报。杜尔在那封电报里指责美国在刚果局势中采取偏袒立场，并且要求美国停止支持非洲解放的敌人。白宫在26日公布了艾森豪威尔给杜尔的复电的内容。艾森豪威尔在复电中竟然硬说杜尔给他的电报“反映了对于美国政府支持非洲自由的政策的严重误解”。复电企图掩饰美国在刚果策划分裂活动和美国打着联合国旗帜干涉刚果内政的事实，硬把美国这种政策说成是“承认和维护它（刚果）的团结和领土完整”。
    艾森豪威尔还把美国支持卡萨武布、敌视卢蒙巴合法政府的行动，说成是美国“试图在那个不幸的国家加强稳定和有效政府的必要基础之一”。艾森豪威尔在信中表明，美国将继续利用联合国干涉刚果。他坚持联合国在刚果的“成功”是“极为重要”的，甚至还要求杜尔“充分支持联合国在那里的努力”。
    据新华社讯　美国为了挑起非洲人之间的不和，正竭力把“联合国军”同刚果军队之间的冲突渲染成为加纳同刚果之间的冲突。22日，美国驻联合国代表华兹沃斯在联合国大会上迫不及待地扬言，如果加纳“接受”蒙博托的非法的“驱逐令”的话，“暴力行动原来是决不会发生的”。他甚至说，美国对加纳政府未能应“刚果”的要求撤走恩克鲁玛总统在利奥波德维尔的“私人”代表韦尔贝克表示“遗憾”。
