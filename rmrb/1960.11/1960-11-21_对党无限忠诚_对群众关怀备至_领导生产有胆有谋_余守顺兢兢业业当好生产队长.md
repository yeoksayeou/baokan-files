    Infinitely Loyal to the Party, Extremely Caring for the Masses, Bold and Resourceful in Leading Production
    Yu Shoushun Diligently Serves as Production Team Leader
    (Our Dispatch) Yu Shoushun, the production team leader of the Third Production Team of the Third Management Area of the Huanglin Commune in Santai County, Sichuan Province, is an outstanding grassroots commander with foresight and decisiveness. Over the past few years, relying on the leadership of the Party and the superiority of the People's Commune, he has led the team members to change the face of his hometown from poor soil, barren land, and low yields. Now, the two canteens in this team have achieved surpluses of grain, vegetables, and firewood. The living standards of the team members have generally surpassed those of the wealthy middle peasants in the local area.
    Transforming Poor Mountains into Rich Villages
    Yu Shoushun, born into a poor peasant family, worked as a boat puller along the Kaijiang and Fujiang rivers before liberation. It was the land reform that allowed him to settle down in the countryside. The experiences of land reform and other struggles after liberation have deeply made him realize that everything the Party wants to do stems from the interests of the people. Therefore, he resolutely listens to the Party and is infinitely loyal to the Party, doing whatever the Party tells him to do.
    The soil in Yu Shoushun's production team was very poor, and the farming methods were originally very rough. When each household farmed on its own, many lands were overgrown with weeds, and one mu of land could only produce four to five hundred catties of sweet potatoes. During the agricultural cooperative period, he led the team members to actively improve the soil and cultivate it meticulously, and grain production increased year by year. In 1959, due to an unprecedented drought in decades, although various rescue efforts were made, the grain harvest was still reduced. In order to overcome the difficulties after the disaster, Yu Shoushun, under the leadership of the Party, organized the masses to discuss questions such as "Is it okay to sit and wait for a good life? How does socialism come about?" This raised the ideological awareness of the masses, and a mass movement of self-reliance and overcoming disasters quickly took shape.
    To increase production, the first thing for this team to do was to further improve the soil. In the struggle to obtain grain from the soil, Yu Shoushun fully relied on the wisdom and strength of the masses and adopted various effective measures, such as mixing mud with sand, adding sand to mud, and making thin soil thicker... After a winter and a spring of hard work, the team improved more than 200 mu of soil. The second step was to vigorously accumulate fertilizer. In addition to accumulating fertilizer themselves, they also organized manpower to dig up tree stumps, collect corn cobs, and exchange them in the city for more than 40,000 catties of manure. In order to plant more and harvest more, they broke the superstition that slopes could not be intercropped, intercropping corn in sweet potato and peanut fields, intercropping peanuts in cotton fields, and intercropping radishes and autumn sweet potatoes in all early corn fields. They also intercropped pumpkins, corn, and cowpeas in the sweet potato fields at the same time, making one mu of land yield the equivalent of several mu. After this hard battle, the team harvested more than 83,000 catties of vegetables, melons, and beans alone this year. Many of the original slope tops where sweet potatoes would not produce vines have been planted with sweet potatoes and intercropped with corn this year, which not only increased the yield of sweet potatoes, but also harvested 60 to 70 catties of corn per mu.
    Resolutely Relying on the Masses
    In his work, Yu Shoushun is good at uniting and relying on activists, and good at relying on the masses. He often says: "No matter how great a person's ability is, without the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, it is difficult to do a good job." Around him, there are often sixteen or seventeen activists united. The vast majority of these people are poor and lower-middle peasants, including: Xiao Huifu, the deputy team leader who dares to speak and act, and is resourceful and decisive; Xiao Huidian and Xiao Hanshun, the work group leaders with advanced ideas and rich production experience; Xiao Hanwen, Xiao Maohua, and Xiao Hanquan, the young people who are hardworking, do their work bravely and vigorously, and are not afraid of difficulties or disregard for personal feelings; and Xiao Huisong, the old man who is impartial and loves to take care of everything. In addition, Yu Shoushun has capable assistants in all aspects of planting vegetables, cooking, and raising pigs.
    The reason why he can unite so many activists is first of all because his excellent qualities and work style are respectable. He has been the team leader for many years and has never owed the public a penny. The team members have repeatedly rated him as a special model, but he always says, "The credit belongs to everyone" and refuses to accept it. His position is firm and clear, he can resist various unhealthy trends and evil practices, and he can distinguish the direction clearly. Therefore, the masses trust him. Secondly, he often strengthens the education and training of activists, helps them solve ideological problems and practical difficulties, and improves their awareness. He is also open-minded in using activists. They not only provide advice and suggestions in production and charge ahead in labor, but also carry out political mobilization work among the masses anytime and anywhere, uniting the masses.
    Careful Calculation and Skillful Deployment of Troops
    Yu Shoushun is best at careful calculation, especially in the use of labor. He often uses the best troops on the front lines, and children and old people are also working on various jobs suitable for their physical strength under his rational arrangement. In order to reduce the labor force required by the logistics department, he solved the jobs of carrying water, cutting vegetables, and picking firewood through the method of incidental labor. In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of each worker, the production team has long implemented a system of quota scoring and awarding bonuses for exceeding the quota.
    Caring for the Masses Everywhere
    From the day the masses elected him as the production team leader, Yu Shoushun realized the importance of his responsibility. He always thinks like this: "The affairs of forty or fifty households cannot be taken lightly. If you lead well, you can make a living and establish a career in your hands; if you don't lead well, you will be unlucky." Therefore, he is always conscientious and diligent, trying his best to do things well.
    He firmly remembers the Party's instructions to care for the lives of the masses, and he also deeply understands the relationship between caring for the people's lives and doing a good job in production. He often keeps in mind the clothing, food, housing, birth, death, marriage, and funeral matters of more than 200 people in the team. Whenever severe cold and heat are about to come, Yu Shoushun always thinks about which household in the team still lacks cotton clothes, which household does not have mosquito nets, and actively helps solve these problems. Under the influence of Yu Shoushun, all the team members regard the difficulties of others as their own, and mutual assistance and unity have become a fashion. Yu Shoushun relies on the masses and arranges everything very thoughtfully for the team members' housing, the cotton thread used by women, the sugar cane that children want to eat, the cigarettes that team members smoke, and other trivial matters in daily life.

    对党无限忠诚　对群众关怀备至　领导生产有胆有谋
    余守顺兢兢业业当好生产队长
    本报讯　四川三台县黄林公社三管理区三生产队队长余守顺，是一位多谋善断、有胆有略的优秀基层指挥员。几年来，他依靠党的领导和人民公社的优越性，领导全队社员，改变了自己家乡土瘦地薄产量低的面貌。现在这个队的两个食堂都做到了粮有余，菜有余，柴有余。社员的生活水平普遍超过了当地的富裕中农。
    变穷山为富乡
    余守顺贫农出身，解放前一直在凯江和涪江沿岸拉船。土地改革才使他在农村安了家。解放后经历过土地改革等斗争，使他深切地认识到党所要办的事情，没有那一样不是从人民的利益出发，因此，他坚决听党的话，对党无限忠诚，党叫干啥就干啥。
    余守顺所在的生产队土质很坏，原来耕作又很粗糙，一家一户的时候，许多土地杂草丛生，一亩地只能产四、五百斤甘薯。在农业社时期，他领导社员积极改良土壤，精耕细作，粮食产量逐年有了增长。1959年，由于出现几十年不遇的大旱，虽然经过多方抢救，仍然少收了粮食。为了克服灾后的困难，余守顺在党的领导下，组织群众讨论了“要过好生活，坐着等待行不行？社会主义怎样来？”等问题，提高了群众的思想觉悟，一个自力更生、战胜灾害的群众运动很快就形成了。
    要增产，对这个队来说，首先是进一步改良土壤。在向土要粮的斗争中，余守顺充分依靠群众的智慧和力量，采取了各种有效的措施。例如大搞泥掺沙，沙加泥，薄土加厚，……经过一冬一春的奋战，全队改良了土壤二百多亩。第二步是大抓肥料，除了自己积造外，还组织人力挖树疙蔸，把玉米芯收起来，到城里换回了四万来斤大粪。为了多种多收，他们打破了坡不能间种的迷信，在甘薯和花生地里间作玉米，棉花地里间作花生，早玉米地全部间种了萝卜和秋甘薯，在薯地里同时套种上南瓜、玉米、豇豆，使一亩地当几亩收。经过这场苦战，今年全队光蔬菜、瓜豆就收了八万三千多斤；许多原来栽薯不倒藤的坡顶土，今年又栽甘薯又间种玉米，不仅甘薯增产，每亩还收了玉米六七十斤。
    坚决依靠群众
    余守顺在工作中，善于团结和依靠积极分子，善于依靠群众。他常说：“一个人再有天大本事，没有党的领导和群众的支持，就很难把工作搞好。”在他的周围，经常团结着十六、七个积极分子，这些人绝大多数都是贫农下中农，其中有：敢说敢干、多谋善断的副队长萧辉富；有思想先进，生产经验丰富的作业组长萧辉典、萧汉顺；有做事任劳任怨、做活勇猛顽强，不怕困难、不顾情面的青年萧汉文、萧茂华、萧汉泉；有铁面无私、啥事都爱管的老人萧辉松。另外，种菜、煮饭、喂猪等各方面都有余守顺的得力帮手。
    他所以能够团结这样多的积极分子，首先是由于他的优良品质和作风令人尊敬。他当了多年的队长，从没欠缺过公家一文钱；社员多次评他为特等模范，他总是说：“功劳是大家的”，不肯接受。他的立场坚定明确，能抵着各种歪风邪气，辨得清方向，因此群众信任他。其次，他经常对积极分子加强教育和培养，帮助他们解决思想问题和实际困难，提高他们的觉悟；对积极分子的使用也放得开手，他们不仅在生产上出谋划策，在劳动上冲锋陷阵，而且随时随地向群众进行政治鼓动工作，团结群众。
    精打细算巧用兵
    余守顺最善于精打细算，特别是在使用劳动力上精打细算。他经常把精兵用在第一线，儿童和老人也都在他的合理安排下，干着适合自己体力的各种活路。为了减少后勤部门所需要的劳动力，他把担水、切菜、拣柴等活路，通过捎带劳动的办法解决了。为了充分调动每个劳力的积极性，这个生产队长期实行了定额评分、超定额给奖的制度。
    处处关心群众
    余守顺从群众选举他当生产队长那一天起，便意识到了自己责任的重大。他随时都这样想：“四十几户人的事情，不可马虎，领导得好，成家立业在你手上；领导不好，背时倒灶也在你手上。”因此，他总是兢兢业业、勤勤恳恳，想尽一切办法把事情办好。
    他牢牢记住党要他关心群众生活的指示，也深深地懂得关心人民生活和搞好生产的关系。全队两百多人的穿衣、吃饭、住房以及生养死葬、婚丧嫁娶等事情，他都经常放在心上。每当严寒酷暑到来以前，余守顺总是要想想全队哪家还缺棉衣，哪家没有蚊帐，并主动帮助解决。在余守顺的影响下，全队社员都把别人的困难当成自己的困难，团结互助已成一种风尚。对于社员住房、妇女用的棉线、小孩要吃的甘蔗、社员抽的烟以及日常生活上的琐碎事情，余守顺都依靠群众，安排得十分周到。
