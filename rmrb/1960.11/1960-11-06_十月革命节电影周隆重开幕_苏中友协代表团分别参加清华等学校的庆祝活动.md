When talking about the tremendous and profound impact of many excellent Soviet films on the broad masses of Chinese film audiences, Shen Yanbing said: Under the guidance and care of the great proletarian revolutionary teacher Lenin and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Soviet film art for the first time became the art of the working people, and became a powerful weapon serving the proletarian revolution and socialist construction. According to Lenin's principle of the Party spirit in literature and art, Soviet film artists for the first time in film history positively praised the heroic deeds of the proletarian revolutionary struggle, and the workers and peasants began to appear on the screen as masters. The growth of Chinese film art takes the great Soviet Union's excellent films as an example.

The Soviet people and the Chinese people have been, are, and will continue to advance shoulder to shoulder in the struggle to win peace, freedom and happiness for all peoples.

Chervonenko introduced the development of the Soviet film screening industry and expressed the hope that the films shown during the film week will enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and will promote the further understanding of the Chinese working people of how the Soviet people of all nationalities defended the victorious achievements of the October Revolution in the cruel battles, and the heroic struggles they have been and are undertaking to build socialism and communism.

    沈雁冰在谈到苏联许多优秀影片对我国广大电影观众有着巨大和深远的影响时说：在伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁和苏联共产党的教导和关怀下，苏联电影艺术第一次成为劳动人民的艺术，成为为无产阶级革命和社会主义建设事业服务的强有力的武器。苏联电影艺术家根据列宁的文学艺术的党性原则，在电影史上第一次正面地歌颂了无产阶级革命斗争的英雄事迹，工农群众开始以主人翁的姿态出现在银幕上。我国电影艺术的成长，就是以伟大的苏联的优秀电影作为榜样的。他深信通过这次电影周这一庆祝活动，将进一步密切中苏两国电影工作者之间的联系，也将进一步加强中苏两国人民之间的兄弟般的深厚友谊。
    苏联驻华大使契尔沃年科也在开幕式上讲了话。他说，这个电影周再一次证明了苏中人民的巩固友谊和我们两国之间全面的文化合作的发展。
    契尔沃年科大使说，中苏两国之间的伟大友谊之所以巩固和牢不可破，是由于它是在马克思列宁主义不朽的灿烂光辉照耀下，并建立在为共产主义的完全胜利而斗争的这一共同基础之上的。苏联人民和中国人民在为争取各族人民的和平、自由和幸福的斗争中，过去、现在和将来都将共同并肩前进。
    契尔沃年科介绍了苏联电影放映事业发展的情况，并希望电影周所放映的影片将增进中苏两国人民的友谊，将促进中国劳动人民进一步了解苏联各族人民怎样在残酷的战斗中保卫了十月革命的胜利成果，以及他们为建设社会主义和共产主义社会已经和正在进行的英勇的斗争。
