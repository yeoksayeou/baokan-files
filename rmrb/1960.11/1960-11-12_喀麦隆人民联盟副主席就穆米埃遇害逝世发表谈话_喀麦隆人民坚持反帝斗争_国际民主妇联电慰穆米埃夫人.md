Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 10th. The Vice-Chairman of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, Kingue Abel, and Ernest Ouandi, when interviewed separately by Xinhua News Agency reporters here this afternoon, stated: "The imperialists' assassination of the Chairman of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, Félix-Roland Moumié, will absolutely not halt the development of the Cameroonian people's national movement. Despite the various difficulties ahead, the Cameroonian people will continue the struggle to the very end."

Kingue Abel said that the imperialists' assassination of the Cameroonian people's leader is an attempt to extinguish the rapidly developing people's revolutionary struggle. However, just like in the case of the assassination of the General Secretary of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, Njoumé, this attempt is destined to fail.

Kingue Abel, referring to the large number of condolence letters and telegrams pouring in from around the world mourning Moumié's death, pointed out that people all over the world oppose the vile crimes of imperialism.

He said that the support and solidarity of the Chinese people has encouraged the Cameroonian people. The imperialists' attempts to obstruct the development of friendly relations between the Chinese and African peoples will not succeed. He said that the African people believe that the Chinese people are their true friends.

Madame Moumié, the wife of the late Chairman Moumié of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, who arrived as the interview was coming to a close, emphasized that this murder was meticulously planned by the imperialist countries. The American, French, and West German imperialists hate the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, and they believe that the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon seriously threatens their interests.

She said: "The imperialists' bombing, slaughter, and assassination of the people proves their weakness and the strength of the people." She emphasized: "The people's struggle will be victorious. Victory belongs to us."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 10th. The Women's International Democratic Federation sent a telegram to Martha Moumié, the wife of the late Dr. Félix-Roland Moumié, Chairman of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon, who was murdered by imperialists, expressing condolences for the death of her husband. The telegram also condemned those who oppose the people's struggle for national independence.

    喀麦隆人民联盟副主席就穆米埃遇害逝世发表谈话
    喀麦隆人民坚持反帝斗争
    国际民主妇联电慰穆米埃夫人
    新华社日内瓦10日电　喀麦隆人民联盟副主席金格·阿贝尔和欧内斯特·乌安迪今天下午在这里单独接见新华社记者时说：“帝国主义者杀害喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·罗兰·穆米埃，这绝不能阻止喀麦隆人民民族运动的发展。尽管面前有种种困难，喀麦隆人民将继续斗争到底。”
    金格·阿贝尔说，帝国主义杀害喀麦隆人民领袖，企图扑灭迅速发展的人民革命斗争。但是，像杀害喀麦隆人民联盟总书记尼奥布的情况一样，这种企图注定要失败。
    金格·阿贝尔谈到从世界各地源源不绝地涌来的大批吊唁穆米埃被害的函电，指出全世界人民反对帝国主义的卑鄙罪行。
    他说，中国人民的支持和声援鼓舞了喀麦隆人。帝国主义者企图阻挠中国人民和非洲人民之间的友好关系的发展，这不会得逞。他说，非洲人民相信，中国人民是他们的真正朋友。
    在接见将结束时来到的喀麦隆人民联盟故主席穆米埃的夫人强调说，这件谋杀案是帝国主义国家周密策划的。美国、法国和西德帝国主义者痛恨喀麦隆人民联盟，他们认为，喀麦隆人民联盟严重地威胁着他们的利益。
    她说：“帝国主义者对人民的轰炸、屠杀和谋害，证明了他们的软弱和人民的力量。”她强调说：“人民的斗争将获得胜利。胜利是属于我们的。”
    新华社柏林10日电　国际民主妇女联合会打电报给被帝国主义者杀害的已故的喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·罗兰·穆米埃博士的夫人玛塔·穆米埃，对她的丈夫被害表示吊慰。电报并且谴责那些反对人民争取民族独立斗争的人。
