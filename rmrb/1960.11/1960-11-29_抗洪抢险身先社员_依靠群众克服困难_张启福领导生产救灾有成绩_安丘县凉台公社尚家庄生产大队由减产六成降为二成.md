(Our Report) Zhang Qifu, the Party Branch Secretary of Shangjiazhuang Production Brigade of Liangtai People's Commune in Anqiu County, Shandong Province, led commune members in production and disaster resistance, greatly mitigating the flood disaster and achieving victory in production and disaster relief work.

Zhang Qifu is forty-two years old this year. From the time he started the elementary cooperative in 1953 until the establishment of the advanced cooperative in 1956, he always served as the director of the cooperative. After the establishment of the People's Commune in 1958, he was elected as the Party Branch Secretary of this brigade. Over the past few years, he has been loyal and hardworking, always doing his best to handle matters that are beneficial to the Party and the commune members.

    Braving the Flood, Taking the Lead
On August 16 this year, due to torrential rain that lasted for a day and a night, the Qu River to the west of Shangjiazhuang breached its banks. The floodwaters, like a runaway horse, poured down with great force. That night, Zhang Qifu was attending a meeting at the commune party committee. The meeting ended too late, so he stayed at the commune. At dawn, he suddenly heard someone shouting, "The Qu River has breached its banks! Go quickly to prevent flooding!" At that moment, he threw on his clothes and ran out of the village. When he saw the situation, he realized that the flood had indeed arrived. What should he do? He first thought of the pig farm in the fields to the west of the village: the terrain there was very low and would definitely be flooded. "Right, go save the pigs first!" he said to himself, quickening his pace and rushing towards the pig farm. When he reached the pig farm, the water had already arrived, but the keepers were still fast asleep. At this critical moment, he shouted at the keepers while starting to open the pens to rescue the pigs. At this time, the farm manager, Sun Chuanli, also ran out of the house with the keepers. Some were driving the pigs out of the pens, while others used the bottoms of grain bins and large urns as small boats to transport the piglets… Thanks to their courageous rescue efforts, when the floodwaters submerged the entire pig farm, all but a few of the more than two hundred piglets were driven to safety.

The flood continued to rush towards the village, threatening the lives and property of more than 1,700 people in the entire village. "Can we just watch as the village and the lives and property of the commune members suffer disaster? Absolutely not." In his desperation, he immediately thought of blocking the flood to the west of the main canal. So, using all his strength, he rushed through the floodwaters, crossed the dam, and hurried back to the village. At this time, the brigade's cadres and commune members had already organized a flood-fighting force of more than 170 people, divided into four groups, and rushed to the canal embankment. When they reached the embankment, there were already two dangerous points where water was entering the embankment. Zhang Qifu took the lead and led a group of commune members to the largest danger point, immediately digging soil to block the breach. But after only a few shovelfuls, the breach became even larger, and the water rushed over, washing away one shovelful of soil for every shovelful that was placed. At that time, Zhang Qifu was heard to say, "As long as the person is here, the land is here, even if I have to give up my life to block it." Then he jumped into the water, using his body to block the flow. His selfless act of rushing to the rescue encouraged the commune members' courage to fight the flood, and before long, the breach was blocked.

    We Must Recover the Losses Caused by the Disaster
The flood damage had become a reality. What to do in the face of the disaster? Zhang Qifu's answer was: we must recover the losses caused by the flood.

The disaster situation at the time was serious. After the disaster, the commune members watched as their flourishing crops were mostly submerged by the water, and their hearts felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over them, and their morale was low. Some commune members said, "Six months of hard work, wiped out by a single flood." But Zhang Qifu was not intimidated by the difficulties. Under the leadership of the commune party committee, he and the brigade cadres, with their chests held high, mobilized the masses to launch a struggle for production and disaster relief. In response to the fear of difficulties that some commune members had, he first publicized the Party's concern and the support of leaders at all levels, and publicized the favorable conditions and specific methods for overcoming the disaster, in order to boost the confidence of the masses. The fourth team suffered the most damage, and the masses' thoughts were unstable. Zhang Qifu personally went to talk to them. Zhang Qifu said to them: "Because of the flood, production has decreased, but are we going to just wait to starve? Or are we going to find ways to help? Besides, if we seize the time to rescue the affected crops, we can still recover some of the grain." Under Zhang Qifu's patient education, the anti-disaster enthusiasm of many commune members was boosted, and they actively went to the fields to work.

Later, some commune members developed wavering sentiments in the actual rescue of late autumn crops, saying things like: "The beans are covered with mud, and nine out of ten pods are empty, washing them won't help." Some commune members also said, "Instead of bothering with this, it would be better to harvest them early." When Zhang Qifu heard these words, he hesitated in his mind, but then he immediately thought: "Is there really no way to deal with it? Let's go to the masses and ask." So, he went to discuss it with the old farmer Xu Qingxi. Xu Qingxi said with certainty:
"If the bean leaves are covered with mud, they can grow normally if they are washed clean." He also introduced his experience in rescuing flooded crops in 1946: that year, when there was a flood, one mu of beans on the west slope was flooded, and half a mu that was washed early yielded seventy-five jin, and half a mu that was not washed in time, and the mud dried on the leaves, only yielded more than ten jin later. After hearing this, Zhang Qifu had an idea in his mind. On the one hand, he publicized Xu Qingxi's experience, and on the other hand, he took the lead through activists such as Xu Benlan. At the same time, the brigade committee explicitly announced the adherence to the "three guarantees and one reward" policy, specifically stipulated labor quotas, so that the activities of washing soybean leaves and other rescuing of affected crops quickly unfolded throughout the brigade. After washing the leaves, picking seedlings, turning vines, and applying fertilizer, the soybeans and sweet potatoes all regained their vitality, creating good conditions for reducing losses in the autumn harvest. Now, according to the output verified during the autumn harvest, the reduction in production in the entire brigade has decreased from the original 60% to 20%, and four out of five teams have overfulfilled the revised contracted output targets.

In order to actively increase the income of commune members, he and the cadres and commune members have recently studied ways to open up more avenues for sideline production. Those lacking raw materials collect raw materials, and those lacking technology organize commune members to study outside, so that the brigade's sideline production has quickly increased from the original five types to nine types.

    We Must Care More About the Lives of Commune Members After the Disaster
Zhang Qifu has always cared about the lives of commune members. He often says: "We who are in charge must take care of both production and life. If the lives of the commune members are not taken care of, how can they have high production enthusiasm!" Especially after the disaster, he paid even more attention to this.

He focused his main efforts on the work of the canteens. In order to help the brigade's five canteens save grain and improve meals, he focused on the third canteen, working as a cook in the canteen on a regular basis to gain experience and promote it in general. He discovered an important problem in this canteen: the thinking of the cooks regarding production and disaster relief was not clear enough. Zhang Qifu educated the cooks, explaining the important responsibilities they bear in the work of production and disaster relief, and improving their ideological awareness; on the other hand, he solicited the opinions of the masses and studied how to improve the meals. In just a few days, the canteen changed greatly, with both dry and thin meals, so that the commune members were both full and saving grain. The commune members said with satisfaction: "The secretary goes down to the canteen, and life changes greatly."

Now, under the leadership of the Party branch, the commune members of the Shangjiazhuang brigade are advancing victoriously, widely unfolding the work of production and disaster relief.

    抗洪抢险身先社员　依靠群众克服困难
    张启福领导生产救灾有成绩
    安丘县凉台公社尚家庄生产大队由减产六成降为二成
    本报讯　山东安丘县凉台人民公社尚家庄生产大队党支部书记张启福，领导社员生产抗灾，大大减轻了洪水灾害，并取得生产救灾工作的胜利。
    张启福今年四十二岁，他从1953年办初级社起，到1956年成立高级社止，始终担任合作社的社长。1958年成立人民公社以后，才被选为这个队的党支部书记。几年来，他一直是忠心耿耿、埋头苦干，只要是对党、对社员有利的事，总是尽力办好。
    抗洪抢险身先社员
    今年8月16日，由于倾盆大雨一连下了一天一夜，尚家庄西面的渠河决口了。洪水像脱缰的野马一样，一股劲地倾泄下来。这一夜，张启福正在公社党委开会。因会散得太晚，宿在公社。拂晓，忽然听得有人喊叫：“渠河决口了，快去防水呀！”这时，他披上衣服就跑出村庄。一看，果然水头来了。怎么办？他首先想到了村西地里的养猪场：那里地势很洼，定会被水淹没。“对，先去救猪！”他自言自语地加紧了脚步，向养猪场奔去。当他跑到猪场时，水已冲来了，可是，饲养员们还在熟睡。在这万分紧急的时刻，他一面喊叫饲养员，一面动手开栏抢猪。这时，场长孙传礼也和饲养员们一起从屋里跑出来。有的从栏里向外赶猪，有的用囤底、大瓮充当小船，抢运小猪，……由于他们奋勇抢救，当洪水淹没整个养猪场的时候，二百多头小猪除了几头被水冲走以外，其余都赶到安全地带。
    洪水继续向村庄冲击，威胁着全村一千七百多口人的生命和财产。“能够眼看着村庄和社员们的生命财产遭受灾害吗？绝对不能。”情急智生，他立刻想到要把洪水挡在大渠道以西。于是，他用尽平生之力，冲过洪水，越过堤坝，急忙跑到了村里。这时队里的干部和社员已经组织了一百七十多人的抢险护坝大军，分作四路，奔向渠道坝堤。当他们跑到坝堤时，已有两处出险，向坝里进水。张启福身先士卒，带着一组社员走上了一个最大的险口，马上挖土抢堵。可是没堵几锨，险口越发开大了，水急冲过来，培上一锨土，冲去一锨土。当时，就听到张启福说了一句：“人在江山在，豁上命也要堵住它。”就跃身跳进水中，用身子堵住水流。舍身抢险的行动，鼓舞了社员的抗洪勇气，不多会，险口就被堵住了。
      一定要把受灾损失的夺回来
    洪水的灾害成为事实了。在水灾面前怎么办？张启福的回答是：一定要把水灾造成的损失夺回来。
    当时的灾情是严重的。受灾以后，社员们眼看着茂盛的庄稼大都被水淹没了，心里像泼上了一瓢凉水似的，情绪低落下来。有些社员说：“辛辛苦苦半年整，一场大水一场空。”可是，张启福并没有被困难吓倒，在公社党委的领导下，他和队干部一起，挺起胸膛，发动群众展开了生产救灾斗争。针对部分社员产生的畏难情绪，他首先到处宣传党的关怀和各级领导的支持，宣传战胜灾荒的有利条件和具体办法，用以鼓舞群众的信心。第四小队灾情重，群众思想不稳定。张启福便亲自找他们谈心。张启福对他们说：“因为水灾是减产了，可是咱是等着挨饿呢？还是想办法救灾？再说，受灾的作物如果抓紧抢救，还是能够收回一部分粮食。”在张启福的耐心教育下，许多社员的抗灾干劲被鼓起来了，积极下地干活。
    后来，有些社员在实际抢救晚秋作物中，又发生动摇情绪，说什么：“豆子淤了泥，十荚九秕子，洗出来也不管用。”有的社员又说：“费这个事，还不如趁早收割了利索。”张启福听了这些话，思想上犹豫了一下，但是，他立时又想：“是不是真的没了办法呢？到群众中去访问一下看。”于是，他去找老农徐清溪商量。徐清溪满有把握地说：
  “豆叶淤上泥，洗干净了就能正常生长。”同时还介绍了他在1946年抢救水淹庄稼的经验：那一年闹水灾时，西坡的一亩豆子被水淹了，有半亩洗得早，收了七十五斤，有半亩没来得及洗，淤泥干在叶子上，以后只收了十几斤。这一说，张启福心里有了主张。他一面宣传徐清溪的经验，一面通过徐本兰等积极分子，带头做起。同时，通过队委会明确宣布了坚持“三包一奖”政策，具体规定了劳动定额，使洗大豆叶等抢救受灾作物的活动，很快在全队展开。经过洗叶、挑秧、翻蔓、追肥的大豆和地瓜都恢复了生机，为秋收减少损失创造了好的条件。现在，全队据秋收核实的产量，减产由原来的六成降为二成，五个小队中有四个队超额完成了修订后的包产指标。
    为了积极增加社员收入，最近他又和干部、社员一起研究大开副业生产门路。缺原料的搜集原料，缺技术的便组织社员到外面学习，使全队的副业生产由原来的五种很快地增加到九种。
      受灾以后更要关心社员生活
    张启福一贯关心社员生活。他常说：“咱这个当家人，既要管生产也要管生活。社员的生活管不好，他那能有很高的生产劲头呢！”特别是受灾以后，他更加注意了这一条。
    他抓生活的主要力量放在食堂工作上。为了帮助全队五个食堂节约用粮，搞好伙食，他以第三食堂作为重点，定时到食堂当炊事员，摸出经验推动一般。他在这个食堂里发现了一个重要问题是：炊事人员生产救灾的思想还不够明确。张启福一面对炊事人员进行教育，说明炊事人员在生产救灾工作中所担负的重大责任，提高其思想觉悟；一面征求群众意见，研究改进伙食。不多几天，食堂就大大变了样，饭食有干、有稀，既使社员吃的饱，又节省了粮食。社员满意地说：“书记下食堂，生活大变样。”
    现在，尚家庄大队的社员在党总支领导下，正乘胜前进，广泛展开生产救灾工作。
