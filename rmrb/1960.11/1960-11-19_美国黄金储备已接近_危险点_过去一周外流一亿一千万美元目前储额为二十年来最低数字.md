Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th: The U.S. Federal Reserve Board announced on the 17th that U.S. gold reserves had fallen to only $18,000,600,000 by the night of the 16th, only $6 million away from the "danger point" of $18 billion recognized by the American newspapers.

This means that in the past week, foreigners have bought another $110 million worth of gold from the United States with the dollars in their hands.

The current U.S. gold reserve figure is the lowest in twenty years, since 1940.

According to the instructions announced by U.S. President Eisenhower on the 16th, attempting to plug the loopholes in the U.S. international balance of payments deficit, Secretary of State Herter has issued orders to ambassadors stationed in various countries, requesting them to report by December 10th which dollar expenditures abroad can be cut, including how much personnel and their families can be reduced.

U.S. Army Secretary Bruck admitted that Eisenhower's small calculations on U.S. troops stationed overseas and their families would affect "morale".

    美国黄金储备已接近“危险点”
    过去一周外流一亿一千万美元目前储额为二十年来最低数字
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：美国联邦储备委员会17日宣布，美国的黄金储备到16日夜间已经只剩下一百八十亿零六百万美元，距离美国报纸公认的一百八十亿美元的
  “危险点”只有六百万美元。
    这就是说，在过去一周中，外国人又以他们手中的美元从美国买走了一亿一千万美元的黄金。
    美国目前黄金储备的数字是1940年以来二十年来的最低数字。
    根据美国总统艾森豪威尔16日宣布的企图补塞美国国际收支逆差漏洞的指示，国务卿赫脱已经向驻各国大使发出命令，要求他们在12月10日前报告究竟可以削减那些在国外的美元开支，包括可以减少多少人员和家属。
    美国陆军部长布鲁克承认，艾森豪威尔在美国驻海外军队和他们的家属头上打的小算盘要使“士气”受影响。
