    Production Successes Pour In; Working People's Enthusiasm Soars
    Moscow Splendidly Adorned to Welcome the Holiday
    Crystal-Clear New Snow, Bright Red Flags
    Brilliantly Lit, Magnificent Cityscape
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 5th. (By our correspondent) As the great 43rd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution approaches, Moscow is filled with a festive atmosphere, brimming with holiday joy. Crystal-clear new snow, bright red flags, and dazzling lights all adorn Moscow, making the city's appearance exceptionally solemn and beautiful.
    On the world-famous Red Square, the holiday decorations have been completed. The Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum has been renovated, and its surroundings have a completely new look. Here, a model of a monument reflecting the Soviet people's excellent beginning in conquering space is installed—a huge, twenty-two-meter-long rocket model made of duralumin points directly at the vast sky. On the department store building, people can see large paintings depicting the Soviet people building communism.
    Gorky Street, the most prosperous street in the city center, has been dressed in festive attire. Countless red flags, slogans, and electric lights decorate the street like a beauty. The facade of the Central Telegraph Office is adorned with a portrait of Lenin, as well as the word "Peace" written in Russian, Chinese, and other languages. Not far from here, the USSR Council of Ministers building, the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building, and the Bolshoi Theatre also attract people's attention with their unique decorations.

    Outstanding Achievements in Labor Competition
    Surplus Production to Greet the Holiday
    Winter came particularly early to Moscow this year. The first snowfall occurred on October 18th. Old Muscovites say that this is a phenomenon unseen in over seventy years. However, the early winter has not diminished people's enthusiasm for celebrating the holiday. Workers, staff, and students, dressed in winter clothes, are using their free time to rehearse for the holiday parade.
    The working people of Moscow are greeting the great revolutionary festival with outstanding achievements in production and construction. As a result of the enthusiastic labor competition, factories and enterprises in Moscow had already completed their production tasks for the first ten months of this year by October 21st, and had exceeded the plan for increasing labor productivity. In the first ten months of this year, they have mastered the production of more than five hundred new types of machines, instruments, and other equipment. In terms of accelerating technological progress, factories and enterprises have installed more than two hundred and eighty automated, mechanized, and conveyor production lines. To date, Moscow's industrial workers have produced billions of rubles worth of steel, machinery, motors, and other industrial equipment above the plan. Construction workers are greeting the festival with one newly built high-rise building after another. Thanks to their efforts, Moscow has added another two and a half million square meters of housing, as well as many schools, clubs, nurseries, and kindergartens.

    Districts Hold Celebration Rallies; Workers Prepare to Be Reviewed
    In recent days, various districts of Moscow have been holding separate celebration rallies. Many members of the "Communist Labor Brigades" in factories are preparing to be reviewed on Red Square. In the parade on November 7th, people will see the contingent of representatives of the five hundred thousand "Communist Labor Brigade" members of the Soviet capital, who have created various models and are preparing to report their glorious labor achievements to the motherland using these models.

    Guests Gather on the Eve of the Festival; Airports and Stations Are Busy
    On the eve of the festival, delegations and distinguished guests from many countries come to Moscow every day. In recent days, the staff at airports and train stations have been exceptionally busy. They are doing everything possible to satisfy guests from all countries.
    The great 43rd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution has arrived, and the people of the Soviet capital are welcoming this holiday with great enthusiasm. (Attached photo)

    生产捷报纷至沓来  劳动人民热情高涨
    莫斯科盛装欢乐迎佳节
    新雪晶莹红旗鲜艳
    灯火辉煌市容壮丽
    新华社莫斯科5日电　本社记者报道：在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年降临的日子里，莫斯科呈现出佳节的气氛，充满着节日的欢乐。晶莹的新雪、鲜艳的红旗、灿烂的灯火，都一齐装饰着莫斯科，使这个城市的面容景色显得格外庄严美丽。
    在举世闻名的红场上，节日的装饰已经完成。列宁—斯大林陵墓经过了一番修整，四周的气象焕然一新。这里装置着反映苏联人民征服宇宙的良好开端的纪念碑模型，一支用硬铝制成的二十二米长的巨大火箭模型直指辽阔的天空。在百货公司的大楼上，人们可以看到描绘苏联人民建设共产主义的大幅图画。
    市中心最繁华的高尔基大街已经披上了节日的盛装，无数的红旗、标语和电灯把这条街道打扮成美人一样。中央电报大楼的正面高悬着列宁的画像，以及用俄文、中文等写成的“和平”字样。离此不远，苏联部长会议大楼、工会大厦圆柱大厅和苏联大剧院也以它们独特的装饰吸引着人们的注意。
    劳动竞赛成绩优异
    超额增产喜迎佳节
    莫斯科今年的冬天来得特别早，10月18日就下了第一场初雪。老莫斯科人说，这是七十多年来未有的现象。但是，早来的冬天并没有减弱人们准备欢度佳节的热情。穿着冬装的工人、职员和学生们，正在利用休息时间，进行参加节日游行的演习。
    莫斯科劳动人民以优异的生产建设成就来迎接伟大的革命节日。由于热烈开展劳动竞赛的结果，莫斯科市的工厂企业早在10月21日就提前完成了今年头十个月的生产任务，并且超额完成了提高劳动生产率的计划。在今年的头十个月中，它们已经掌握了五百多种新式机器、仪器和其它设备的生产。在加速技术进步方面，各工厂企业已经安装了二百八十多条自动化、机械化和传送作业线。到目前为止，莫斯科的工业劳动者已经超计划生产了价值数十亿卢布的钢铁、机器、电动机以及其它工业设备。建筑工人们用一座又一座刚刚建成的高楼大厦迎接节日。由于他们的努力，莫斯科又增加了二百五十万平方米的住宅，以及许多学校、俱乐部、托儿所和幼儿园的建筑物。
    各区举行庆祝集会　工人准备接受检阅
    这几天来，莫斯科市的各个区都在分别举行庆祝集会。许多工厂的“共产主义劳动队”队员们都准备在红场上接受检阅。在11月7日的游行队伍中，人们将看到苏联首都五十万“共产主义劳动队”队员代表们的队伍，他们制作了各种各样的模型，准备用这些模型向祖国汇报光辉的劳动成绩。
    节日前夕嘉宾云集　机场车站一片繁忙
    在节日的前夕，每天都有许多国家的代表团和贵宾来到莫斯科，这几天来，机场和火车站的工作人员，显得异常忙碌。他们正在进行着一切工作，以便使来自各国的贵宾感到满意。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年已经来到了，苏联首都人民正怀着巨大的热情在迎接这个节日。（附图片）
