What are the Background Reasons for the Capitalist World's Gold Rush?

Editor's Note: The gold rush that has recently erupted in the capitalist world has not yet subsided. Although American newspapers are reluctant to discuss the real reasons for this trend, they have to admit that this phenomenon reflects people's "uneasy feelings about the dollar" and "concerns about our (American) economic structure." The following are excerpts from two articles.

(I)

The "Christian Science Monitor" of October 21 published an article by its Washington correspondent Strout, entitled: "US Treasury Punctures Gold Bubble," excerpted as follows:

A secret and mysterious river of gold is flowing around the globe.

Since the US government holds $18.5 billion worth of gold in Fort Knox and elsewhere, and since the US is legally required to buy gold at $35 an ounce, this river has a huge impact on the United States.

Last week, a shock caused by foreign private speculators seeking limited freely tradable gold supplies caused gold prices to rise.

The United States once again found itself having to get involved in this vortex, because one of the reasons speculators are buying gold (and converting the international exchange medium – the dollar – into gold) is that they believe the "dollar is weak." Some are casually saying that the United States is planning to "devalue the dollar."

The price of gold per ounce rose as follows:

October 17 – 15 cents. October 18 – 18 cents. October 19 – 26 and a half cents. October 20 – Six dollars. On October 20, the price of gold in the London market rose to a peak of $41 per ounce.

In this gold rush, some have made fortunes and some have suffered losses. Apart from its vivid aspects, it is a cause for concern. It shows that the Western world is in an unstable state...

Superficially, the reasons for the rise in gold prices seem simple.

However, this gold wave also reflects, to some extent, uneasy feelings about the dollar.

(II)

The American "Star-Ledger" of October 25 published an article by Brown entitled "Fears About the US Economy," excerpted as follows:

The two presidential candidates have been trying to cover up economic and financial difficulties, because they have this popular idea: what voters don't know can't hurt them.

However, the recent dramatic rise in gold prices in the London market has drawn attention to our economic and financial structure. According to news from abroad, our Western allies are not very interested in who is elected the next president of the United States. Judging from the campaign speeches of Vice President Nixon and Senator Kennedy, they are convinced that neither of them will interrupt the US policy of supporting the free world.

But, at the same time, realistic politicians and financiers across the Atlantic recognize – perhaps more clearly than American voters and the economic advisors of the two candidates – that the United States can no longer play the role of Atlas (the god in Greek mythology who was punished to support the heavens on his shoulders – editor's note) and carry the world on its shoulders for long...

Whether our political prestige abroad has been lost or continues to be maintained is a question that Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kennedy and their supporters have been hotly debating. But those familiar with Europe, Asia, and Latin America know that prestige means reliance on strength.

Our prestige was at its peak when it was supported by our past enormous military and economic power. Regardless of what is said in the campaign speeches, our friends and allies... have fears about our economic structure. If we continue down the path we started more than twenty years ago, our financial structure may run into difficulties.

### 资本主义世界抢购黄金的背景原因何在？

专栏：外论摘要

    资本主义世界抢购黄金的背景原因何在？
    编者按：资本主义世界最近爆发的抢购黄金风潮，迄今尚未平息。美国报刊尽管不愿意谈论发生这一风潮的真正原因，但它们不得不承认，这种现象反映了人们“对美元的不安定的心情”，“对我们（美国）的经济结构有所忧虑。”下面是两篇文章的摘要。
              （一）
    10月21日的“基督教科学箴言报”刊载了该报驻华盛顿记者斯特劳特的一篇文章，题为：“美国财政部戳破了黄金的气泡”，摘译如下：
    一条秘密和神秘的黄金的河流正在环着全球流动。
    由于美国政府在诺克斯堡和其他地方握有价值一百八十五亿美元的黄金，由于美国按照法律规定以每盎斯三十五美元的价格购买黄金，因此，这条河流对美国影响巨大。
    上周，由外国的私人投机商为牟取有限的可以自由买卖的黄金供应而作的冲击使黄金价格上涨。
    美国又一次发现它自己不得不卷入这一旋涡，因为投机商购买黄金（并把国际兑换媒介——美元——变换为黄金）的原因之一是认为“美元孱弱”。有人在随便说美国正打算让“美元贬值”。
    每盎斯黄金的价格上涨如下：
    10月17日——一角五分。10月18日——一角八分。10月19日——二角六分半。10月20日——六块美元。10月20日，伦敦市场的黄金价格上升到最高峰，达每盎斯四十一块美元。
    在这个黄金潮中，有人发了财，有人遭到损失。除了它的生动的方面以外，它却是令人忧虑的原因。这表明西方世界处于不稳定的状态……。
    表面上，引起黄金价格上涨的原因似乎很简单。
    但是，这次黄金的浪潮在某种程度上也反映了对美元的不安定的心情。
              （二）
    10月25日的美国“明星晚报”刊载了布朗的一篇文章，题为“对美国经济的忧惧”，摘译如下：
    两位总统候选人一直在设法掩饰经济和财政方面的困难，因为他们有着这种流行的想法：凡是选民们所不知道的东西，那都是对选民没有损害的。
    然而，最近伦敦市场上黄金价格的惊人上升使我们的经济和财政结构引起了人们的注意。据来自国外的消息说，我们的西方盟国对于谁当选美国的下一任总统并不怎么感兴趣。它们根据副总统尼克松和参议员肯尼迪的竞选演说来判断，深信他们两人谁也不会中断美国的支持自由世界的政策。
    但是，同时，大西洋彼岸的现实的政治家和金融家们认识到——也许比美国的选民和两位候选人的经济顾问们认识得更清楚——美国不可能再长期扮演阿特拉斯神（希腊神话中被罚两肩掮天的神——编者注）的角色，而把世界掮在自己的肩上。……
    我们在国外的政治威信究竟已经丧失还是继续保持，尼克松先生和肯尼迪先生以及他们的支持者们一直在热烈辩论这个问题。但是，那些熟悉欧洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的人知道，威信意味着对力量的依靠。
    当我们的威信得到我们过去的巨大的军事和经济力量支持的时候，它就处于最高峰。不管竞选演说中说些什么，我们的朋友和盟国们……对我们的经济结构有所忧惧。如果我们在二十多年前开始走的道路上继续走下去的话，我们的财政结构可能陷入困难。
