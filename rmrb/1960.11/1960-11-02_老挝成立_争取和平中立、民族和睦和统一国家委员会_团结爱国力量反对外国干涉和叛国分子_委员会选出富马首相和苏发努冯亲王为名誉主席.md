Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 1st. According to Vientiane Radio's broadcast today, representatives from various Lao political parties, mass organizations, and non-partisan individuals, totaling thirty-four people, held a meeting in Vientiane yesterday to announce the establishment of the "National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unification."

    The chairman of the preparatory committee of this committee, Quinim Pholsena, delivered the opening speech at the meeting. He said, "Through the resolute struggle of the people of all ethnic groups and strata throughout the country, especially after the coup d'état led by Captain Kong Le on August 9th, the situation in our country has undergone new changes, creating favorable conditions for the country to break free from foreign constraints and control, and a government pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality has been established. This government has correctly implemented a number of foreign and domestic policies, such as establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union; holding negotiations between the government and the Lao Patriotic Front—which will lead to Lao national harmony and unification. All of this is a great victory for the people of our country, which has made the people very excited."

    He pointed out, "However, foreign interventionists and a small number of Laotians have expressed dissatisfaction with the above-mentioned victories of the people. They are stepping up their planning of vicious conspiracies to obstruct Laos' progress. They have established a so-called 'Revolutionary Committee' to oppose the King, the Constitution, and conspire to overthrow the legitimate government of Phouma, divide the motherland, and attempt to restore their dictatorial system and continue the civil war. Their actions are very dangerous to the country, and will bring the tragic sight of death to all Lao people."

    Quinim Pholsena said, "Under these circumstances, the entire people have unanimously expressed their desire for a peaceful and neutral, nationally harmonious and unified country. Various political parties, intellectuals, monks, people of all ethnic groups and strata have jointly expressed their opposition to the vicious conspiracies of foreign interventionists and traitorous groups that harm the people, and support a government that achieves peace and neutrality, national harmony and national unification."

    He continued, "Currently, there is no close cooperation between the various patriotic political parties and patriotic individuals, and the struggle activities carried out for the same purpose have not yet been unified. Therefore, although some victories have been achieved so far, they still cannot meet the requirements of the situation. Therefore, in order to meet the requirements of the situation and the wishes of the people, a meeting to establish the 'National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unification' is being held here."

    Quinim Pholsena said, "The purpose of this committee is to gather all patriotic political parties and all patriotic forces, regardless of class, ethnicity, or religious belief, to stand on the same path and fight for our beloved motherland to correctly follow the path of peace and neutrality, national harmony and national unification."

    He announced that the main policies of the "National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unification" are:

    Unite all people, ethnic groups, political parties, and patriotic intellectuals to oppose foreign interference and the conspiracies of traitorous elements, to make Laos a truly peaceful and neutral, independent, unified, and democratic country, and to defend the motherland, religion, the King, and the Constitution.

    Support the establishment of a coalition government including representatives of all political parties, ethnic groups, and patriotic intellectuals, symbolizing broad national unity.

    Take the Constitution, the 1954 Geneva Agreements, and the 1957 Vientiane Agreements as the principles for establishing national harmony, and guarantee the people's rights to freedom and democracy.

    Promote a policy of peace and neutrality and make it achieve practical results, establish friendly relations with all countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, especially with neighboring countries, regardless of their political systems. Do not join any military alliance, and, except as provided in the Geneva Agreements, do not allow any country to establish military bases on Lao territory.

    Freely accept assistance from all countries that sincerely help Laos without any political or military conditions attached, thereby improving the people's lives and building the country's economy, and enabling the country to embark on the path of genuine economic independence.

    Quinim Pholsena said that the above-mentioned policies are the direction in which all patriotic parties and patriotic individuals agree to participate as members of the "National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unification." It will help all patriotic parties and individuals achieve unified action in their political struggles, so that the nation will have more patriotic forces united, and this force will be further strengthened. Only in this way can the nation move towards the road of strength and prosperity.

    老挝成立“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”
    团结爱国力量反对外国干涉和叛国分子
    委员会选出富马首相和苏发努冯亲王为名誉主席
    新华社河内1日电　据万象电台今天广播，老挝各政党、群众组织的代表和无党派人士三十四人昨天在万象举行会议，宣布成立“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”。
    这个委员会的筹备委员会主席方·丰萨万在会上致开幕词。他说，
  “在全国各族各阶层人民和宗教人士的坚决斗争下，特别是在8月9日以贡勒大尉为首的政变发生后，我们国家的局势有了新的变化，出现了使国家摆脱外国束缚和控制的有利条件，并成立了奉行和平中立政策的政府。这个政府正确履行了一些对外对内政策，如同苏联建立外交关系；举行政府同老挝爱国战线党之间的谈判——它将使老挝民族和睦和统一。所有这一切都是我国人民的巨大胜利，它使人民非常兴奋。”
    他指出，“但是对于人民的上述胜利，外国干涉者和少数老挝人却表示不满。他们加紧策划恶毒的阴谋，来阻挠老挝的前进。他们成立了所谓‘革命委员会’来反对国王、宪法，阴谋推翻富马合法政府，分裂祖国，妄图恢复他们的独裁制度和继续进行内战。他们的这种行动对国家非常危险，它将给全体老挝人民带来死亡的悲惨景象。”
    丰萨万说，“在这种情况下，全体人民一致表示了他们希望和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的意志。各政党、知识分子、僧侣、各民族和各阶层人民共同表示反对外国干涉者和叛国殃民集团的恶毒阴谋，支持实现和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的政府。”
    他接着说，“目前在各个爱国政党之间和爱国人士之间还没有紧密的合作，由于同一目的进行的斗争活动还没有互相统一起来。所以到目前为止，尽管取得一些胜利，但是还不能满足局势的要求。因此，为了满足局势的要求和人民的愿望，在这里召开了成立‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’的会议。”
    丰萨万说，“这个委员会的目的是，集合一切爱国的政党、一切爱国力量，不分阶级、民族和宗教信仰，站在同一条道路上，为我们可爱的祖国正确遵循和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的道路而斗争。”
    他宣布，“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”的主要政策是：
    团结一切人民、民族、政党和爱国的知识分子，反对外国干涉和叛国分子的阴谋活动，使老挝成为一个真正和平中立、独立、统一和民主的国家，保卫祖国、宗教、国王和宪法。
    支持成立包括各政党、各民族和爱国知识分子代表参加的、象征民族广泛团结的联合政府。
    以宪法、1954年的日内瓦协议、1957年的万象协议作为建立民族和睦的原则，保障人民的自由民主权利。
    推进和平中立政策，并使其获得实际结果，按照和平共处五项原则同一切国家建立友好关系，特别是同邻国建立友好关系，不管它们的政治制度如何。不加入任何军事联盟，除了日内瓦协议的规定之外，不让任何国家在老挝国土上建立军事基地。
    放手接受一切有诚意帮助老挝的国家的不附带任何政治、军事条件的援助，从而改善人民的生活和建设国家的经济，使国家走上真正的经济独立。
    方·丰萨万说，上述的政策是一切爱国党派、爱国人士同意参加为“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”的成员的方向。它将帮助所有爱国党派和人士在进行政治斗争中获得统一行动，从而使民族有更多的爱国力量联合起来，使这种力量进一步壮大。只有这样才能够使民族走向强盛和富裕的道路。
    新华社河内1日电　据万象电台今天中午广播，老挝“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”中央委员会10月31日一致通过了一项告全民书。告全民书宣布，它将同老挝全国人民合作，反对外国的干涉和叛国分子，使老挝在和平中立的道路上前进，使老挝人民和睦来争取国家的统一。
    告全民书指出，老挝拥护和平中立政策委员会、政变委员会、青年组织、老挝爱国战线党的代表，爱国议员，政府重要人士，爱国人士，各族和宗教代表以及各阶层代表，10月31日在首都万象举行了会议，并成立了“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会 ”。 
    告全民书说，“这个委员会代表着我国民族广泛的团结，代表着老挝人民的爱国精神和正当愿望。它将同老挝全国人民合作，以反对外国的干涉和叛国分子的行动，使我们可爱的祖国在和平中立的道路上前进，使老挝人民互相和睦来争取祖国的统一。这都是为了切实地保卫祖国、宗教、国王和宪法。”
    告全民书说，“‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’必须得到全国人民的彻底支持和合作才能实现和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家的政策。”
    告全民书说，“‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’亲切地呼吁各政党、民族、职员、军警、青年、学生、商人、工人、农民、知识分子、僧侣、皇族中的爱国人士互相团结，支持‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’，使它成为富马合法政府实行和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家政策的后盾。”
    告全民书呼吁老挝全体人民起来反对外国的干涉，反对一小撮人正在阴谋推翻王国取消宪法、推翻富马政府、分裂祖国、拖延内战的叛国行动。
    委员会还呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民，尤其是亚非各国人民支持老挝人民的正义斗争。
