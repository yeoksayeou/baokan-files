    Toilets That Can Accumulate and Create Fertilizer

    The Jinhua Commune in Anyang City, Henan Province, has changed its earthen toilets and earthenware urn-style latrine ponds into trailer-type latrine ponds. This not only reduces the loss of manure and urine but also expands the source of fertilizer, turning the latrine pond from a place for accumulating fertilizer into a place for both accumulating and creating fertilizer.

    During the fertilizer accumulation campaign, the Commune Party Committee focused on summarizing the experience of latrine pond fertilizer accumulation. It discovered that earthen toilets and earthenware urn-style latrine ponds were narrow and small, unable to fully control the loss of manure and urine. Moreover, they could only accumulate fertilizer and not create it. Therefore, it was decided to mobilize the masses to rebuild the toilets, digging a four-foot-deep, five-foot-square pit next to the toilet. In this way, the loss of manure and urine could be reduced, and weeds, leaves, and dirty soil could be added to the pit at any time to promote fermentation and create fertilizer. After the reconstruction, in just five days, each latrine pond accumulated and created 500 dan (approximately 50,000 kg) of high-quality fertilizer.

    能积能造的厕所
    河南安阳市金华公社把土厕所和瓦瓮式茅池改为拖斗式茅池，既减少了粪尿流失，又扩大了肥源，使茅池由积肥的地方变成既能积肥又能造肥的地方。
    在积肥运动中，这个公社党委重点总结了茅池积肥的经验，发现土厕所和瓦瓮式茅池池子窄小，不能完全控制粪尿流失，而且只能积肥，不能造肥，于是决定发动群众改建厕所，在厕所的旁边挖一个四尺深、五尺见方的池坑。这样，既减少了粪尿流失，又可随时把杂草、树叶、脏土等掺在池内促使发酵造肥。改建以后，仅五天时间，每个茅池就积造了五百担优质肥料。
