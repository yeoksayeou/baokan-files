    Female Militia Bravely Rescue Disaster Victims

    Three young female militia members from Duc Son Commune, Duc Tho District, Ha Tinh Province, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recently rescued two hundred disaster-stricken people in the struggle against floods, risking their lives.

    Recently, Ha Tinh Province was hit by a typhoon, causing flash floods, and the Lo River overflowed, causing a disaster. In the areas affected by the floods, many people were trapped by the water or drowned, their lives in great danger.

    In this critical situation, young female militia members Xuan, Yin, and Qing of Duc Son Commune, Duc Tho District, along with many cadres and militia members, bravely launched a struggle to rescue disaster victims. The three girls risked their lives, rowing small boats everywhere to rescue people. They rescued batch after batch, forgetting sleep and meals, and fought continuously for seven days and seven nights. Once, the wooden boat that Qing and Yin were riding in was broken by the rapids of the Lo River, and they were also overturned by the flood. Fortunately, they grabbed onto trees and were not washed away, but after they were rescued, they did not hesitate to throw themselves back into the rescue battle.

    The flood was finally overcome by the people. The heroic deeds of these three female militia members were warmly praised by the people, and the people who were rescued by them were even more grateful. Everyone praised them in unison as "Female Soldiers of Dien Bien Phu." (Attached picture)

    女民兵奋勇救灾民
    越南民主共和国河静省德寿县德山乡的三位青年女民兵，最近在同洪水作斗争中，奋不顾身地抢救了二百个受灾人民。
    最近，河静省由于台风袭击，山洪暴发，罗江泛滥成灾。在受到洪水侵袭的地方，许多人被水围困或溺于水中，生命十分危险。
    在这种危急的情况下，德寿县德山乡青年女民兵春、寅、清同许多干部和民兵一起，奋勇地展开了抢救灾民的斗争。三位姑娘奋不顾身地摇着小船到处救人。她们救了这批又去抢救那批，废寝忘食，连续战斗了七天七夜。一次，清和寅乘坐的木船被罗江的激流冲破，她俩也被洪水打翻。幸而抓住树木，才没有被水冲走，但当她们获救以后，又毫不犹豫地投入了抢救战斗。
    洪水终于被人们战胜了，这三位女民兵的英勇事迹受到了人们热烈赞颂，被她们救出脱险的人们更是感佩不已。大家都异口同声地称她们为“奠边府的女战士”。（附图片）
