Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, October 31st: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, led by Deputy Head General Luo Ruiqing, bid farewell to Kaesong, a city full of Korean-Chinese friendship, this morning and visited the Hwanghae Iron Works in Hwanghae-bukto.

When the delegation left the people of Kaesong, who vigilantly guard the eastern outpost of socialism, more than 10,000 people and officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army went to the station to see them off with a feeling of reluctance to part with their Chinese relatives. They held high the national flags of Korea and China and flowers, enthusiastically shouting "Long live!" and scattering colorful confetti on the distinguished guests. The Kaesong station was transformed into an ocean of flowers and red flags, with songs such as "Song of General Kim Il-sung," "The East is Red," and "March of the Chinese People's Volunteers" rising one after another. General Luo Ruiqing and all members of the delegation shook hands with the leading comrades of the Party, government, and military in the Kaesong area who came to see them off, all the staff of the Korean-Chinese side of the Korean Military Armistice Commission, and waved frequently to the people of Kaesong. When the train started, the masses seeing them off also hung long colored ribbons on the train.

When the train carrying the delegation passed Sariwon City, the capital of Hwanghae-bukto, the leading comrades of the Party, government, military, and social organizations of Hwanghae-bukto and Sariwon City were already waiting warmly at the station to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests, including Li Jae-yeong, Chairman of the Hwanghae-bukto Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kim Yong-jin, Chairman of the Hwanghae-bukto People's Committee, Nam In-ho, Chairman of the Hwanghae-bukto Economic Committee, Park Young-seon, Chairman of the Sariwon City Party Committee, Jo Kuk-jin, Chairman of the Sariwon City People's Committee, and other heads of institutions and organizations. After General Luo Ruiqing and the comrades of the delegation got off the train and shook hands with the welcomers, they went to the Hwanghae Iron Works accompanied by Comrades Li Jae-yeong, Kim Yong-jin, and Nam In-ho.

Before the delegation even reached the factory gate, more than 8,000 steelworkers and their families were already cheering. A group of children ran up to present flowers, followed by a group of Young Pioneers who ran up to present red scarves to the delegation. From outside the factory gate all the way to the central office of the factory, the masses, holding high the national flags of Korea and China and bouquets of flowers, enthusiastically cheered "Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

Kim Hyung-sam, Director of the Hwanghae Iron Works, introduced to the delegation how, under the wise leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and Premier Kim Il-sung, this iron works was built into a modern-scale steel city on the ruins. During the war, American imperialism dropped 30,000 bombs on this iron works, destroying all the equipment, but the heroic Korean workers stubbornly persisted in their struggle, with the youth going to the front lines to kill the enemy and the older workers producing military supplies underground to support the front. After the armistice, the Hwanghae Iron Works restored production at a high speed in just over a year, using equipment entirely created by the Korean people themselves. Today, it has reached a level of producing more than 800 tons of steel per day. More than 220 work teams in the entire factory participated in the Chollima work team movement and carried out large-scale technological innovations. Their common determination is to strive to reach a level of producing 1,000 tons of steel per day by the end of this year.

After visiting this iron works, the delegation highly praised the soaring ambition of the Korean working class and exchanged gifts with the workers.

Accompanying the delegation on the visit today were Vice Minister of National Defense Choi Yong-jin, Lieutenant General, and Deputy Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, Li Jang-soo, Major General.

    告别充满朝中友谊的开城
    我代表团参观黄海制铁所
    新华社开城31日电　中国访朝军事友好代表团由副团长罗瑞卿大将率领，今天上午告别充满朝中友谊的开城，到黄海北道的黄海制铁所参观访问。
    当代表团离开警惕地守卫着社会主义东方前哨的开城人民时，一万多群众和朝鲜人民军官兵怀着对中国亲人依依不舍的心情，到车站欢送。他们高举着朝中两国国旗和鲜花，热情地欢呼“万岁”，并且把彩色缤纷的花纸撒到贵宾们的身上。开城车站变成了花和红旗的海洋，“金日成将军之歌”、“东方红”、“志愿军战歌”的歌声此起彼伏。罗瑞卿大将和代表团全体成员同前来送行的开城地区党、政、军领导人，朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中方面代表团全体工作人员一一握手并向开城人民频频招手致意。列车开动时，欢送的群众还把长长的彩带悬在列车上。
    代表团乘坐的列车路过黄海北道首府沙里院市时，黄海北道和沙里院市的党、政、军、以及社会团体领导人，早就热情地等在车站上欢迎中国贵宾，其中有朝鲜劳动党黄海北道委员会委员长李在英、道人民委员会委员长金容镇、道经济委员会委员长南仁浩，沙里院市党委会委员长朴英善、市人民委员会委员长赵国镇以及其他机关、团体负责人。罗瑞卿大将和代表团的同志们下车同欢迎者一一握手后，在李在英、金容镇、南仁浩三位同志陪同下，到了黄海制铁所。
    代表团还未到厂门，八千多名炼钢工人和工人家属早就欢呼起来。一群儿童跑来献了花，接着一群少年团员跑来向代表团献红领巾。从厂门外一直到厂中心的办公室，高举朝中两国国旗和花束的群众，热烈地欢呼“金日成元帅万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”
    黄海制铁所的所长金衡三向代表团介绍了这个制铁所在朝鲜劳动党和金日成首相英明领导下，在废墟上建成现代规模的钢铁城的情况。战争时期，美帝国主义向这个制铁所投下了三万颗炸弹，全部设备被破坏，但是英勇的朝鲜工人们始终顽强地坚持斗争，青年上前线杀敌，老年工人在地下生产军需品支援前线。停战后，黄海制铁所用不过一年时间的高速度，使用全部由朝鲜人民自己创造的设备恢复了生产。今天已达到了日产钢八百吨以上的水平。全厂二百二十多个作业班参加了千里马作业班运动，并且大搞技术革新，他们共同的决心是争取在今年年底达到日产一千吨钢的水平。
    代表团参观这个制铁所后，对朝鲜工人阶级这种高速度前进的雄心大志倍加赞扬，并且同工人们相互赠送了礼品。
    今天陪同代表团参观访问的有朝鲜民族保卫省副相崔勇进上将、朝鲜人民军总政治局副局长李长秀少将。
