Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 27th. The Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in its "Letter from the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to The National Congress of the Republic of Korea, South Korean Political Parties, Social Organizations and People," has attached an "Opinion Paper on Realizing Economic and Cultural Exchange Between North and South Korea and Seeking Independent Development of the South Korean National Economy."

Regarding the revitalization and development of South Korean agriculture, the opinion paper points out that, in order to make farmers the masters of the land, all existing tenant land should be purchased by the state and distributed free of charge to farmers with little or no land. The opinion paper also proposes specific measures to restore and expand South Korea's irrigation facilities and to extensively carry out soil and water conservation work. The opinion paper states that in order to realize agricultural mechanization in South Korea, while building modern agricultural machinery factories, it is necessary to firmly rely on the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry in the northern half. North and South Korea should exchange various seeds, breeding livestock, saplings, etc., and jointly take measures to combat diseases and pests. The opinion paper states that in order to eliminate the colonial nature of South Korean agriculture, it is necessary to eliminate the dumping of American surplus agricultural products and restore the cultivation of wheat, cotton and silkworm cocoon production. The opinion paper emphasizes the need to quickly stabilize the lives of South Korean poor farmers who are currently in a state of despair.

In order to rapidly revive and develop South Korea's fisheries and the lives of fishermen, the opinion paper emphasizes that North and South fishing grounds and fishing ports should be opened and jointly utilized, the US military's occupation of South Korean fishing grounds and fishing ports should be immediately removed, free fishing activities should be guaranteed, the restoration of damaged fishing port facilities should be actively promoted, the extremely difficult lives of fishermen should be rapidly stabilized, and the tax burden on fishermen should be significantly reduced.

When discussing the development of South Korea's national industry, the opinion paper suggests ensuring the normal production of existing factories and mines, building many industrial enterprises, and overcoming chronic mass unemployment in the next two or three years. After pointing out that the state should issue unemployment benefits to the unemployed and universally implement the eight-hour working day, the opinion paper states that we can accept South Korean unemployed people who are willing to come to the northern half to work at any time, and guarantee their employment and stable lives.

The opinion paper points out that the serious difficulties faced by South Korea's national industry in terms of raw materials, capital, and sales channels should be resolved quickly. To this end, South Korea should gradually establish an independent heavy industry base for developing national resources and a series of new industrial sectors. It is necessary to resolutely prevent the intrusion of foreign goods such as American surplus commodities and thoroughly protect national industries. The opinion paper further puts forward some specific suggestions for organizing the rational division of labor in the industries of North and South Korea and organically linking the industries of North and South Korea in order to create favorable conditions for future unified development. The opinion paper states that in order to alleviate the tense housing situation of South Korean residents, housing should be built on a large scale in South Korea.

The opinion paper states that when discussing economic cooperation and trade between the North and the South, in order to rely on the strong economic foundation of the northern half and mobilize all the materials, technologies and financial resources of the northern half to revive the bankrupt South Korean economy and stabilize and improve people's lives, we propose to provide a series of material and technical assistance.

The opinion paper says that economic exchange and mutual cooperation between North and South Korea can only be achieved through free trade between the North and the South. To this end, we suggest to the South Korean authorities that representatives from the business community of both sides organize a joint chamber of commerce to establish close commercial ties. The opinion paper points out that in order to fully guarantee economic exchanges, transportation and postal and telecommunications links between the North and the South must be restored immediately.

Finally, when discussing the realization of exchanges and cooperation in the fields of science, culture, education and health, the opinion paper states that all unemployed South Korean scientists and technicians should be absorbed into scientific research and technical guidance work, and North and South Korea should jointly establish scientific research institutions and jointly contribute to the development of the national economy. Exchanges and cooperation between the North and the South should also be realized in the cultural and artistic sectors, and the erosion of decadent American "culture" should be resolutely resisted. At the same time, the opinion paper also suggests that South Korea thoroughly improve the education of the next generation and the training of national cadres, and rapidly implement a comprehensive compulsory primary education system. North Korea will accept South Korean homeless orphans year by year and take full responsibility for raising them. The opinion paper also suggests that North and South health workers establish close ties and cooperate. Finally, the opinion paper calls on all workers, farmers, young students, scientific and cultural workers, entrepreneurs, merchants, and all conscientious and enlightened people in North and South Korea to unite and take action to realize this rational and urgent proposal.
