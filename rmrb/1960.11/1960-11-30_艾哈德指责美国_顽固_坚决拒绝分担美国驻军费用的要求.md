Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch from Dusseldorf: West German Economics Minister Erhard, speaking at a meeting of the Dusseldorf industrial and commercial community yesterday, angrily accused the United States of taking a "stubborn" attitude during the recent U.S.-West German financial talks.

Erhard was the chief West German representative at these talks. He expressed great dissatisfaction that the U.S. side repeatedly pressured West Germany to bear the expenses of the U.S. troops stationed in West Germany. He said, "In the course of the negotiations, the American negotiators never gave up their stubborn attitude, always reverting to the topic of the (U.S.) troop costs in West Germany, a question that must be firmly rejected."

He also criticized the United States for not being able to "fully appreciate" West Germany's promise to provide 4 billion marks (approximately 1 billion U.S. dollars) in so-called "development assistance" to underdeveloped countries. Erhard stated that West Germany had "nothing to be ashamed of" in its "contribution" to foreign "aid." He said that, compared to France, France's expenditures in Algeria "cannot be considered development assistance."

Erhard also listed in his speech the "contributions" West Germany had already made to the United States in other areas.

He said that West Germany had already prepaid 60% of its military orders from the United States, which were supposed to run until 1964. West German foreign "aid" loans are not limited to buying West German goods, which means that the United States can benefit from orders from underdeveloped countries using West German loans.

    艾哈德指责美国“顽固”
    坚决拒绝分担美国驻军费用的要求
    新华社29日讯　杜塞尔多夫消息：西德经济部长艾哈德昨天在杜塞尔多夫工商业界的一次会议上讲话时恼怒地指责美国在最近的美国西德财政会谈中态度“顽固”。
    艾哈德是这次会谈西德方面的主要代表。他表示十分不满美国方面再三逼迫西德承担美国驻西德军队的开支。他说，“在谈判过程中，美国的谈判人一直不放弃他们的顽固态度，总是回复到（美国在西德的）驻军费用的题目上来，而这个问题是必须予以坚决拒绝的。”
    他还抨击美国不能“充分赏识”西德答应提供的四十亿马克（约合十亿美元）的所谓对不发达国家的“开发援助”。艾哈德说什么西德在对外“援助”的“贡献”上是“毫无愧色的”。他说，比起法国来，法国在阿尔及利亚的支出是“不能算作开发援助”的。
    艾哈德还在讲话中历数西德在别的方面已经对美国作出的“贡献”。
    他说，西德已经向美国预付了到1964年为止的军事订货的60％。西德对外“援助”贷款并不限定要买西德货，这就是说，美国可以从不发达国家用西德贷款订货中得到好处。
