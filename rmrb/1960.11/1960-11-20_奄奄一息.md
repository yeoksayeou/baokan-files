    On the Verge of Death
    Fang Cheng (painting), Tian Ma (poem)
    1. This belly rumbles and groans, swollen to such a state, making it hard to move an inch, suffering immensely, sighing and panting on the bed. Hurriedly seeking a doctor for a prescription, the doctor takes the pulse and ponders: only to blame your deep-seated viruses, which caused this malignant bloating!
    2. One trip after another, this diarrheal patient insists on seeking me out! Shiny gold flows out, the belly empty and the guts aching. Everyone dislikes me, leaving me lonely and isolated. Back in the day, I stirred up storms and waves, but now I'm filled with sorrow!
    3. Hemiplegic, lying in bed, this suffering is truly extraordinary! Look at others, striving upwards with full force, the east wind brings the fragrance of a hundred flowers. Here, it is all desolation, the west wind rustling with secret sorrow! Any panacea is useless; eradicating the root of the disease is but a pipe dream!
    4. A series of moans and panics, each one critically ill. Bragging and blustering loudly, it's all a fantasy! Pity you too, Kennedy, you and I have the same condition! Registration procedures have been completed, you can take my bed! (Attached image)

    奄奄一息
    方成画  天马诗
    一这肚皮儿呼噜直响，胀成了这般模样，寸步难行苦难当，长吁短叹卧牙床。急寻大夫开药方，大夫把脉暗思量：只怪你病毒太深，害了这恶性膨胀！
    二一趟一趟又一趟，这泻肚病儿偏把咱找
  上！光闪闪的黄金往外
  流，肚内空空痛断肠。众人见我都讨厌，把我孤孤单单丢一
  旁。想当年也曾兴风作
  浪，到而今倍添惆怅！
    三半身不遂躺在床，这痛苦确非寻常！看人家一股劲儿往上
  长，东风阵阵百花香。咱这里满目凄凉，西风瑟瑟暗神伤！任什么神丹妙药，要挖掉病根儿那是妄
  想！

  一阵呻吟一阵惊慌，一个个病入膏肓。牛皮吹得怪响，全是幻梦一场！苦了你也肯尼迪，你我病情全一样！挂号手续已办好，我的床位你补上！（附图片）
