Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd: The China Political Science and Law Society hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the Japanese legal workers delegation headed by Takenaka Michitaka.

Wu Defeng, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Society, expressed a warm welcome to the Japanese friends in his speech at the banquet.

Wu Defeng praised the Japanese people of all strata for their more than twenty united actions against the Japan-U.S. military alliance treaty and for demanding Japanese independence. He said that although the struggle of the Japanese people is arduous, as long as they unite as one, persevere unremittingly, and fight to the end, the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Japanese people.

Takenaka Michitaka, head of the Japanese legal workers delegation, expressed gratitude to the Chinese people on behalf of the Japanese people at the banquet. He said that in the recent Japanese election, although the Liberal Democratic Party adopted many anti-democratic measures, the Japanese people finally shattered the original plan of the Liberal Democratic Party, which is an important victory. Takenaka Michitaka said that the struggle of more than ten million Japanese people against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is unprecedented in Japanese history. He said that our struggle lacks experience, and there will be many difficulties in the future, but we believe that as long as we have the correct purpose and take the correct actions, the struggle will surely be victorious.

Saito Kazuyoshi, a member of the delegation and representative of the Japan Young Jurists Association, and Naito Isao, a member of the delegation and representative of the Japan Trade Union Council Defense Team, also spoke at the banquet.

Among those present at the banquet tonight were Zhang Zhiran, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Society, Ma Xiwu, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, as well as Li Dequan, Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyuan, Zhao Anbo, Yang Zheng and other relevant figures.

Japanese peace activist in Beijing, Kinkazu Saionji, was also invited to attend the banquet.
