    An Old Doctor on the Agricultural Front Lines
    In the Menggan Brigade of the Jinya People's Commune, in Fengshan County, where the Yao ethnic minority lives, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, over half a century old, can often be seen with a medicine kit slung over his shoulder, patiently prescribing medicine to the sick and injured. The Yao compatriots of Menggan Brigade are all vying to spread his model deeds, calling him a "good doctor."
    This doctor is Su Yaohong.
    Su Yaohong is a traditional Chinese medicine doctor from the Neli Brigade of the Jinya People's Commune. When he learned that the Menggan Brigade had no doctor to treat illnesses, he thought, "Disease not only brings suffering to people but also hinders the realization of this year's exceeding production target. The Neli Brigade already has two doctors; I can spare myself to support the Yao compatriots." So he volunteered to the commune Party committee requesting to be sent to the Menggan Brigade, determined to settle there and contribute to the elimination of disease and the vigorous development of agriculture. The commune Party committee and the health center, after discussion, approved his request.
    In order to ensure the health of the army engaged in the autumn harvest and winter planting, Dr. Su often makes rounds in the fields, providing treatment on the spot for those who are ill and participating in production when not treating patients. The commune members said with emotion, "Dr. Su is truly our loved one, helping to treat illnesses and helping with production from early morning to late at night. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we have such a good doctor!"
    Dr. Su not only wholeheartedly treats patients but also frequently mobilizes the masses to eliminate the four pests and promote sanitation. Moreover, he is cultivating his own doctors from the minority ethnic group. With the efforts of Dr. Su and his apprentices, the incidence of disease among the commune members of the entire brigade has been greatly reduced, and the vast majority of people are healthy, full of energy, and have a high enthusiasm for labor.
    Because Dr. Su diligently serves the people, he has been awarded the title of model three times.

    农业第一线上的老医生
    在广西瑶族同胞聚居的凤山县金牙公社猛干大队，经常出现一位年过半百，身挂十字药箱的中医生，耐心地给病伤员开方治病。猛干大队的瑶族同胞都争相传诵着他的模范事迹，称他是个“好医生”。
    这个医生就是粟耀洪。
    粟耀洪是金牙公社内里大队的中医生。当他知道猛干大队没有医生医病的时候，他就想：“疾病不但给人们带来痛苦，而且也会妨碍今年超包产计划的实现，内里大队已有两个医生了，我可以抽身支援瑶胞。”于是他自告奋勇向公社党委请求派他到猛干大队去，决心在那里安家落户，为消灭疾病、为大办农业贡献出一份力量。公社党委和卫生所研究后，批准了他的请求。
    为了保证秋收冬种大军的身体健康，粟医生经常到田间巡回，做到有病随地治疗，无病治疗就参加生产。社员感动地说：“粟医生真是我们的亲人，每天早出晚归帮医病，帮生产，只有在共产党领导下才有这样的好医生！”
    粟医生不但一心一意给病人看病，同时还经常发动群众除四害，讲卫生；并且为少数民族培养了自己的医生。在粟耀洪师徒的努力下，现在全大队社员疾病大大减少，绝大部分人身体健康，精神饱满，劳动热情高涨。
    由于粟医生勤勤恳恳为人民服务，曾经获得三次模范的称号。
