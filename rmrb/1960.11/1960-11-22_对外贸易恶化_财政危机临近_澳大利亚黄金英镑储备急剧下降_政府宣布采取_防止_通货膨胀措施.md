    Xinhua News Agency, Sydney: The Australian government's gold and sterling reserves are plummeting. Foreign exchange reserves are now only 359.9 million Australian pounds. Since the decline began in May this year, foreign exchange has decreased by 107.7 million pounds to its current level.

    The Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia predicts that by the end of this year, Australia's foreign exchange reserves will decrease by another 200 million Australian pounds, which is "very dangerous" for Australia.

    The governor of the government-controlled Commonwealth Bank, H.C. Coombs, recently listed three reasons for the decline in reserves in the bank's annual report to the Federal Parliament: large imports; an estimated decrease in wool production; and a decline in wool prices.

    At the same time Coombs presented his report, the Federal Bureau of Census and Statistics released overseas trade figures showing an "visible" deficit of 83 million pounds in the three months of July, August and September. Export income was 198.4 million pounds, and import costs were 281.4 million pounds.

    The Australian government announced measures to prevent inflation on the evening of the 16th to cope with serious financial difficulties.

    The measures include raising bank overdraft rates from 6% to 7% and increasing the sales tax on automobiles from 30% to 40%.

    When announcing these measures in the House of Representatives, Treasurer Harold Holt admitted that Australia's foreign exchange reserves abroad have recently declined rapidly. He said that this decline would likely continue in this fiscal year.

    He said that banks would reduce advances and restrict borrowing. However, no direct action has yet been taken to restrict imports or increase tariffs.

    Holt said in a statement issued in Adelaide on Saturday that the average price of wool had fallen by about 15%, widening the gap between Australia's imports and exports.

    He said: "If the overall export prices continue to remain at the current level, our estimated export income in this fiscal year will be reduced by 40 million to 48 million pounds."

    Meanwhile, it is reported that Australian wool sales from July to October this year decreased by 19 million Australian pounds compared with the same period last year.

    As another indication of Australian economic trends, stock market prices have also been declining rapidly recently.

    Australian officials and bourgeois newspapers are uneasy about the prospect of a serious economic crisis facing the country.

    对外贸易恶化　财政危机临近
    澳大利亚黄金英镑储备急剧下降
    政府宣布采取“防止”通货膨胀措施
    据新华社讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚政府的黄金和英镑储备正在急剧下降。外汇储备现在只有三亿五千九百九十万澳镑。外汇从今年5月开始下降以来，已经下降了一亿零七百七十万镑而减到目前的水平。
    澳大利亚制造商联合会预测，到今年年底，澳大利亚的外汇储备会再减少二亿澳镑，对澳大利亚来说，“这是非常危险的”。
    政府控制的联邦银行行长麦克唐纳最近在向联邦议会提出这个银行的年度报告中列举了储备下降的三个原因：大量的进口；估计羊毛产量将减少和羊毛价格的下降。
    在麦克唐纳提出报告的同时，联邦调查统计局公布了海外贸易数字，它们表明，在七、八、九这三个月中，出现了八千三百万镑的“有形”赤字。出口收入是一亿九千八百四十万镑，进口费用是二亿八千一百四十万镑。
    澳大利亚政府16日晚上宣布了防止通货膨胀的措施，以应付严重的财政困难。
    这个措施包括把银行透支利率从6％提高到7％，把汽车销售税从30％增加到40％。
    财政部长哈罗德·霍尔特在众议院宣布此项措施时承认，澳大利亚的在国外的外汇储备最近已迅速下降。他说，这种下降在本财政年度中大概将继续下去。
    他说，银行将减少预支和限制借款。但是对限制进口或者增加关税方面尚未采取直接行动。
    霍尔特星期六在阿得雷德发表的声明中说，羊毛的平均价格下降15％左右，已扩大了澳大利亚进出口的差额。
    他说：“如果总的出口价格继续保持目前状况，我们在本财政年度中估计的出口收入将要减少四千万英镑到四千八百万英镑。”
    同时，据报道，本年7月到10月澳大利亚羊毛的销售比去年同期减少了一千九百万澳镑。
    作为澳大利亚经济趋势的另一迹象，股票市场的价格最近期间也一直在迅速下降中。
    澳大利亚官方和资产阶级报纸对这个国家面临严重经济危机的前景感到不安。
