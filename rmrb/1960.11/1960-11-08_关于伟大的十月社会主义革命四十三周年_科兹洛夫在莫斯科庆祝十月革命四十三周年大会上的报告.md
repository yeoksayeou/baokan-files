Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th (TASS dispatch): Kozlov's report at the Moscow celebration meeting for the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution on November 6, 1960, is as follows:

Dear Comrades! Respected foreign guests!

The glorious and joyous festival – the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution – has arrived. Our brothers, the people of the countries of the powerful socialist camp, the working people of all countries, and the entire progressive humanity are celebrating this great festival with the Soviet people.

Comrades, please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, the entire Soviet people, and the participants of this celebration, to extend a warm welcome to the leaders and members of the delegations of socialist countries present here, the leaders of fraternal communist and workers' parties, and all the guests who have come to Moscow to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Revolution with us.

Please allow me, through our dear foreign friends, to extend sincere respect to all fraternal communist and workers' parties who hold high the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism and continue the great cause of the October Revolution, and to extend warm respect to all the working people, all the ordinary people of the world, and all the fighters for peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism.

Comrades!

Every time we grandly celebrate the Great October Socialist Revolution, each of us feels proud of the unprecedented achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party, and rejoices in the brilliant victories we have achieved in another year of rapid progress.

Now, when the whole world sees how smoothly the magnificent program of our communist construction formulated by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is being realized, we feel particularly strong pride in our great people, in our beautiful motherland, and in the Leninist Communist Party.

The outstanding thinkers of mankind once predicted the inevitable victory of communism, and now, here with us, it is being transformed from the bright ideal of the working people into reality. This is the main summary of the 43-year development path of the Soviet state, and also the main summary of the heroic labor of the Soviet people, who are the masters of their country and the free and conscious creators of their own destiny.

The October Revolution opened a new historical era – the era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism and communism worldwide. The lofty ideas of the Great October inspired the working people and the exploited all over the world to rise up and fight against their age-old enemies – the oppressors, and this idea fundamentally shook the wage slavery system – the capitalist system.

The Soviet state, born in October 1917, built socialism under capitalist encirclement for many years, repelling the frenzied attacks of the imperialists. After the victorious end of the Second World War, when the most reactionary imperialist forces were defeated, an event of great historical significance occurred in the world. Following the Soviet Union, many countries in Europe and Asia embarked on the road of socialism. The powerful socialist camp now has more than one billion people – more than one-third of mankind. Under the blows of the national liberation movement, the shameful colonial system is collapsing completely; the people of many colonies and dependent countries have achieved national independence. The sphere of influence of imperialism has now been greatly reduced. The ideas of the October Revolution have brought freedom and happiness to billions of people. It will give freedom and happiness to all mankind.

The transition from capitalism to socialism, which began with the Great October Socialist Revolution, constitutes the main content of the present era.

In every corner of our planet, billions of people link the possibility of solving such pressing socio-political issues as guaranteeing lasting peace, complete and thorough disarmament, and eliminating colonialism with the Soviet Union, with the entire socialist camp, and with the ideas of communism. Our Soviet state is the spokesman and defender of peace, it expresses the hopes of all nations, firmly and confidently raising the banner of progress. A belief is growing ever deeper in the consciousness of the people of all countries: that the road of socialism and communism is the only correct road for social development, it can free the working people from devastating wars and bring them a high level of material well-being and genuine freedom.

The Soviet Union gloriously fulfills its lofty internationalist duty, the duty of a consistent and unwavering defender of the vital interests of the working people of all countries and all peace-loving nations. The outstanding activities of the Soviet delegation and its leader Comrade Khrushchev at the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly vividly confirm this.

The active participation of Comrade Khrushchev and many outstanding state activists from socialist countries in the 15th session of the UN General Assembly turned this session into an international event of very great significance. The Soviet proposals that the UN must discuss such issues as complete and thorough disarmament, the elimination of colonialism, and granting independence to all countries and peoples, and our other proposals, received the warm support of the delegations of socialist countries and a series of neutral countries. This is completely understandable, because the Soviet Union proposed for discussion pressing issues in contemporary international life that are of great significance to the fate of this generation and the next. A fresh breeze blew into the walls of the United Nations, clearing away the musty and stagnant atmosphere in the UN halls.

The speeches of N.S. Khrushchev, full of revolutionary enthusiasm and based on a great belief in the correctness of our cause, tore off the masks of the imperialist swindlers who deceive the people, exposing their hostile stance towards peace. The imperialists felt the irresistible force of communist logic and truth even in their own homes, let them and their lackeys run around and wail. The Soviet Union, socialism, and the forces of progress have once again achieved a major moral and political victory over the forces of imperialism, gaining millions of new friends. This is the inevitable result of our Leninist foreign policy, which is permeated with the vibrant ideas of October, and which, since the time of Lenin, has never been as active and purposefully determined as it is now.

The activities of the Soviet delegation and its leader Comrade Khrushchev at the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly received warm support from all Soviet people, the people of socialist countries, and the entire progressive humanity.

The Soviet people and our party consider their internationalist obligations to the working people of all countries to be: to further strengthen the power of the Soviet Union, to strengthen the unity and strength of the socialist camp and the international workers' and communist movement. Our people and their tested vanguard in struggle and labor, the glorious Communist Party, will continue to dedicate all their strength to the great cause of communism, to the struggle for world peace.

The Powerful Strides of Communism

Comrades!

Another year has passed in our lives, illuminated by the ideas of the Great October Revolution. This has been a year of new and outstanding achievements for the Soviet people. Now, all of us can say with satisfaction that the situation in our country has never been so solid and full of hope. Khrushchev once gave a short but very insightful evaluation of our country's life. He said: "We, the Soviet Union, have everything necessary. Our country is an economically prosperous and strong country. We are working to improve the living standards of our people. We have extremely good prospects. We do not need to get anything from other people, except friendship. We have everything necessary to satisfy the needs of the people."

Standing at the summit of the forty-three years experienced since the victory of the proletarian revolution, we can clearly see the difficult road our country has traveled in these decades and the greatness of our victory.

During the period when the young Soviet republic had just begun peaceful socialist construction, the great leader, the Communist Party, and the founder of our country, V.I. Lenin, spoke with feeling about the economic backwardness of the country, about the remnants of the patriarchal system, semi-savagery, and real barbarism that shrouded the vast expanse of our country. It was he, our dear Ilyich, who predicted that Soviet Russia would inevitably become a truly powerful and prosperous Russia.

Lenin's prophecy has come true. The wisdom and foresight of the Communist Party, its correct leadership, and the heroic working class, the glorious collective farmers, and the selfless struggle of the people's intellectuals year after year have transformed our motherland into a powerful socialist country.

The forty-third year of the Great October Revolution has added many achievements to the country. The Leninist policy of utilizing the unlimited possibilities of the socialist system to accelerate the advance towards communism is being resolutely implemented in our country. This policy is centrally reflected in the historically significant resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Party, in the seven-year plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union, and in a series of huge measures taken by the CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet government to further develop industry and agriculture, to improve the methods of leadership over industry and agriculture, and to accelerate technological progress and improve the material welfare of the people.

Now, as the second year of the seven-year plan is about to end, some conclusions can be drawn on the nationwide struggle to complete this grand plan.

The seven-year plan stipulates that industrial products will increase by an average of 8.6% each year. In fact, it increased by more than 11% in 1959. Agricultural workers also completed their tasks very well last year. This has expanded and strengthened the material and technical foundation of Soviet society, making it possible to greatly increase our material resources.

The tasks put forward for the second year of the seven-year plan are even higher than those stipulated in the seven-year plan. Although this year has not yet ended, there is every reason to say that these raised tasks will also be overfulfilled. In the first nine months of this year, the total industrial output value plan was completed by 103%. According to the control figures of the seven-year plan, the industrial output value of our country should increase by 17% from 1959 to 1960. In fact, it will increase by almost 23%. In the first two years of the seven-year plan, our industrial output value will be approximately 120 billion rubles more than stipulated in the seven-year plan. In 1960, more than 1,000 new large industrial enterprises were put into production. In this way, by the third year of the seven-year plan, we will have more potential.

The achievements made by agricultural workers are clear to all of us. In the past six years, our total agricultural output value has increased by one and a half times. Collective farms and state farms, in order to further increase production, expanded the sown area of crops harvested in 1960 by seven million hectares. It is gratifying that the state now obtains from collective farms and state farms not only the entire marketable product of grain crops and industrial raw material crops, but also the vast majority of marketable products of animal husbandry.

Collective farmers and state farm workers have also worked hard this year. It should be said that the current weather is unusually changeable: the southern regions lost a portion of winter crops due to frost and strong winds, and Kazakhstan and Siberia were affected by a long spring and cold summer. Nevertheless, the amount of grain purchased by the state will not be reduced, and beets, sunflowers, and vegetables will be more than last year. Six or seven years ago, bad weather had a serious impact on our food balance and the food supply to residents. This situation no longer exists. We are now less affected by natural phenomena than we were a few years ago. This convincingly proves the high effectiveness of the Party's measures to sharply increase agriculture and further strengthen the collective farm system.

Our Party Central Committee and the Soviet government will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that the country continuously receives increasing amounts of grain and agricultural raw materials for industry year after year. The plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, scheduled to be held in December, will comprehensively discuss the issue of agricultural development and formulate the path for the struggle to further expand the production of agricultural products.

The working people of our country have achieved many brilliant victories in preparing to solemnly welcome the forty-third anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the December plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee.

Yesterday, we all saw the news of the great achievements of the agricultural workers of the Russian Federation, who completed the plan for selling grain to the state. They sold 1,801 million poods of grain to the motherland, which is 158 million poods more than the total sales in 1959. It is gratifying that the harvest in the reclamation areas accounted for 1,008.9 million poods of these commercial grains. The collective farms and state farms of the Russian Federation sold 2.2 times more corn this year than last year, and completed the annual plan for the sale of meat ahead of schedule, providing the state with 281,000 tons more meat than in the same period in 1959. All Soviet people are proud of these outstanding achievements of the people of all nationalities of the Russian Federation.

The agricultural workers of the Belarusian Republic have completed the plan for selling grain, meat, milk, and eggs to the state ahead of schedule. The milk purchased in this republic was 122,000 tons more than in the same period last year, and the potatoes purchased were 350,000 tons more than the total purchased in 1959. All of us are very satisfied with these achievements of the Belarusian people.

Our other republics have also made significant achievements in agricultural development.

1960 marked many new scientific achievements and inventions. The most outstanding of these was the flight of a heavy spaceship carrying biological organisms into space and its return to Earth. This remarkable feat by Soviet scientists, engineers, and workers once again confirmed the Soviet Union's champion status in many fields of knowledge.

The achievements of Soviet science in the peaceful use of atomic energy are well-known. Great results have also been achieved in the theory of superconductivity, acoustics, solid-state strength physics, and ultra-high pressure. The research work of chemists in manufacturing new substances and materials, especially in manufacturing plastics that can replace steel and other metals, is extremely effective.

The achievements of science and technology enable us to solve the important tasks of the national economy in an unprecedentedly short period. It has become commonplace to build a large open-hearth furnace in five or six months and a blast furnace in eight or nine months. The builders of cement plants can complete powerful converter integrated technological process lines in six to eight months.

Now, we are building hydropower stations at a much faster rate. On November 4, the whole country knew about the huge victory on the Dnieper River. The builders put the Kremenchug Hydropower Station, with a total generating capacity of 625,000 kilowatts, into production two years ahead of schedule. This made a new contribution to the realization of the great Lenin's testament on the electrification of our country.

And how confidently is the machinery manufacturing industry striding forward! Let me give an example. A few years ago, we were very proud to say that we had manufactured geared turbines with a power of 115,000 kilowatts for the Volga Hydropower Station. Now, machine manufacturers have manufactured unparalleled radial-axial turbines with a power of 225,000 kilowatts for the Bratsk Hydropower Station and are studying water turbines with a power of 500,000 kilowatts. In the first year and a half of the seven-year plan, more than 3,000 new types of machines, machine tools, machinery, and instruments were manufactured.

The undeniable achievements of science, technology, and industrial construction make it possible to rapidly increase production capacity, thereby continuously increasing the absolute annual increase in industrial products.

This is a natural process, a reflection of one of the laws of communist construction, as N.S. Khrushchev said at the 21st Party Congress, that this law is: "The gradual transition to communism must not be understood as some kind of slow movement," and cannot be "limited to what has been achieved, because this will lead to stagnation."

The speed of establishing the material and technical base of communism is constantly increasing, also because the cultural and technical level of the people is rapidly rising, and their communist consciousness is increasing day by day.

The Soviet people now treat their labor with a higher standard than ever before. They are unwilling to tolerate the phenomenon of individual production units falling behind and failing to reach their potential. Therefore, many production innovators and experienced organizers have volunteered to go to backward units and bring these units into the ranks of advanced units. The communist labor movement is expanding and deepening. Now, there are many factories, mines, oil fields, and construction sites that are competing for the glorious title of communist labor collective.

What do all these facts indicate? What conclusions can be drawn from this?

First, we can now confidently say that the Soviet people will complete the seven-year plan ahead of schedule.

Second, the Soviet Union is winning more and more time in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism year by year, and therefore we are full of confidence that we will catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in the shortest historical period.

In terms of industrial production, the Soviet Union has long since jumped to second place in the world, second only to the United States. However, we are now advancing at a speed that the United States cannot reach. During the sixteen years after the war, the Soviet Union's industrial production increased by an average of 10.7% per year, while the United States increased by an average of 1.8% per year.

But the matter is not only about the percentage increase, we are confidently catching up with the United States in terms of the absolute annual increase in industrial products and in terms of the total output value of industrial products. Pre-revolutionary Russia produced seven-eighths less industrial products than the United States. Now, the output value of the Soviet Union's industrial production is 60% of that of the United States, and the agricultural output value is 75-80%. The Soviet Union has already surpassed the United States in terms of iron ore and coal mining, in terms of coke, mainline carriages, grain harvesting combines, sawn timber, woolen fabrics, animal oil, and sugar production. We certainly know that a series of industrial sectors in the United States are still ahead of us. But the "variety" of those products in which we are leaving the United States behind in absolute output will increase year by year.

The speed of our forward development and the achievements we have made in various sectors of the national economy leave us no doubt that the prospects for economic competition with capitalism are extremely bright for us. All sober-minded people in the world who can calmly assess the balance of power on the world stage and the unlimited potential of the socialist system are increasingly seeing this clearly.

However, among the defenders of capitalism, there are still some die-hards who waste their efforts to spread doubt about what is undeniable. For example, US presidential candidate Nixon said not long ago that the comparison between the Soviet speed and the US speed is "like comparing the speed of a child's physical growth and the speed of an adult's intellectual growth." This is truly like the saying: "Whoever has tasted bile, their mouth is always bitter." Unfortunately for Mr. Nixon, despite his pursuit of imagery but lacking persuasive comparisons, he himself is like a child "concentrating" on catching butterflies, not seeing anything else around him. Mr. Nixon is unwilling to consider: that the healthy and strong child has long since grown into an adult and is establishing the great achievements that those with so-called "adult wisdom" have been unable to establish until now.

While exposing the imperialist lackeys who painstakingly try to distort the facts, we say: the socialist economy is a young, powerful, and healthy organism, while the capitalist economy is an old man, and no matter what pills and plasters are used, he cannot be cured of his incurable diseases.

Communism is the true youth of the world, and capitalism is the yesterday of the world. This is the objective truth, this is the law of history.

True, the captains of capitalist countries do not recognize this objective truth and are unwilling to consider the facts. In particular, they still try to act tough. But, life is whipping them. President Eisenhower, in his State of the Union address in January, guaranteed that 1960 would be a year of "unprecedented prosperity" for the United States. However, the US business publication "Business Week" had to admit in August that there was a clear recession in many economic sectors in the United States this year, and it said with frustration: "The enthusiasm of industry does not appear according to the script written by Eisenhower."

The fact that the Soviet Union is rapidly catching up with the United States in steel production is particularly troubling to the Americans. We should say that their uneasiness is completely justified. In 1945, the Soviet Union's steel production was only equal to 17% of the US production level; while in 1959, our steel production reached 71% of the US production. And everyone knows that steel production is one of the basic signs of national strength.

Our Party and all the Soviet people firmly believe that our country will achieve victory in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism in the near future. This is inevitable, just as dawn inevitably comes after night.

However, the Soviet people will never be satisfied with everything that has been achieved, and will never revel in success. We have a good habit, which is to concentrate our efforts on completing new and greater tasks.

Now, the Communist Party has put forward an undertaking of paramount importance - to improve quality indicators in industry, construction, collective farms, state farms, and transportation, in all sectors of the national economy. The problem is not only the quality of products. Of course, the trademarks of Soviet enterprises are originally a reliable guarantee for every machine and every product. I am now referring to quality indicators in a broad sense. Now, when the planned tasks of total output value are usually completed and overfulfilled, the focus of attention of Party, Soviet, trade union, and economic organizations at all levels should be on improving labor productivity, reducing product costs and construction prices, increasing accumulation, and should be on technological progress, automation and full mechanization of production, and more rational utilization of investment.

In agriculture, we will continue to strive to increase the yield per unit area of all field crops and the productivity of livestock production, to strive to use technical equipment more effectively, and to continuously reduce the amount of labor expended for the production of each quintal of grain, cotton, vegetables, meat, and milk.

Comrades! When our Party mobilized the people for the October Revolution, it said that only socialism and communism can guarantee the full and comprehensive satisfaction of the material and spiritual needs of the working people. To this end, we have built and are building factories and power stations, accelerating the speed of economic construction, and developing all sectors of culture. And this is now bearing rich fruits. In the Soviet land, life is becoming more and more pleasant and happy!

In this regard, the forty-third year after the victory of the socialist revolution in Russia is very distinctive. Based on the growth of national income, the actual income of Soviet residents increased by more than half during the period from 1953 to 1960. The transition of all employees to a six or seven-hour working day is being completed. From November 1, about 50 million people have already transitioned to a shortened working day. The production of consumer goods is constantly increasing. From October 1, the gradual abolition of employee taxes began. Our motherland is confidently moving towards the world's highest standard of living for the people.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government pay special attention to the growth of social consumption funds. This is an extremely important communist path to improve the welfare of the Soviet people. By the end of the seven-year plan, the state's expenditure on national education, medical facilities, social insurance, and other social consumption aspects will reach approximately 3,800 rubles per capita per year, or more than 300 rubles per capita per month, calculated on the average for each employee. This is a considerable "supplement" to the wages of employees and the income of collective farmers. By the end of the seven-year plan, the state's appropriations for the construction of housing, schools, cultural life, and medical institutions will reach more than 800 rubles per capita per year, calculated on the average for each employee.

The Party's and government's constant concern for improving the living conditions of the Soviet people can also be illustrated by the following fact: from 1957 to 1960 (including 1960), the total housing area constructed in cities and worker settlements is almost 300 million square meters. Compare this to pre-revolutionary Russia, when the total housing area in all cities and worker settlements across the country was only about 180 million square meters.

Comrades! We have the right to point out the great achievements we have made in the economy, culture, science, and technology. But what makes us even prouder is the creator of all the beautiful and great things in our country - the Soviet people. The brilliant spiritual world of the Soviet people, their selfless loyalty to the cause of communism, their love and respect for labor, and collectivism - all of this can only be cultivated under the conditions of the socialist system, under the conditions of providing genuine freedom for creative talents.

Our great cultural revolution is inextricably linked to the huge economic transformation. As a result of this cultural revolution, a generation of knowledgeable and educated people has grown up in the Soviet country. We have long since occupied the first place in the world in training specialized personnel in many professions, especially engineers. The line of combining education with productive labor, which is implemented by the Party and supported by the people across the country, as well as the practice of massively involving people with secondary and higher education levels in material production, is achieving significant results in eliminating the major differences between physical labor and mental labor.

The outstanding result of the Party's huge educational work among the masses is that our people have accepted Marxism-Leninism as their worldview. The Soviet people fully understand the Party's line of building socialism and communism, and consciously build socialism and communism.

Where, in which capitalist country, can there be such a great will and spirit as millions of young patriots volunteering to reclaim wasteland, volunteering to go to new construction projects in the East? Where can there be such a thing as selfless help to comrades working together becoming a routine? Where can there be such things as the unpaid voluntary completion of all kinds of important tasks that often require a lot of effort and time? Only in socialist society can these firmly enter people's daily lives!

Comrades, you must have all read Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev's enthusiastic telegram to Mikhail Andreevich Lukashkin, a pig breeder at the "Glukhovsky" State Farm in the Tambov Oblast - a former major in the Soviet Army. Comrade Lukashkin did not go to find a "money-making" and "comfortable" job, did not pursue high positions. He voluntarily joined the glorious ranks of those who create material wealth and achieved excellent results.

From this incident, as well as many other similar facts, one can see the beauty of the Soviet people's hearts and their high sense of responsibility to society!

Continuing to educate the people in the communist spirit and resolutely eradicating the old remnants of the old era still retained by a portion - albeit a very small portion - of the Soviet people is an extremely important task of our ideological work.

Establishing the material and technical base of communism, developing communist social relations on this basis, and cultivating and training new people - these are the main and interrelated tasks of communist construction. We are successfully solving these tasks. More and more magnificent prospects are unfolding before us. We are moving forward with confidence, towards new victories.

The Struggle for Peace

Is the Most Important Task of Modern Times

Comrades! Socialism (the Great October Revolution declared its arrival in our country) has now become a world system. Under the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism, the great Chinese people, the people of Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia are now working together with the Soviet Union to establish a new life.

Socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country, this is one of the greatest victories in the long-term struggle between labor and capital. This victory has fundamentally changed the political, economic, and ideological life of all mankind. The era of the universal rule of imperialism has gone forever. The formation of the world socialist system is the most significant historical event after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and this system is becoming the decisive factor in the development of human society.

There is also a category of countries that have emerged on the international stage that are unwilling to absolutely obey the imperialist countries. The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, who have achieved independence or are fighting for independence in the stubborn struggle against the colonialists, are increasingly actively participating in international life, making their own contributions to weakening the position of imperialism.

In the countries of monopoly capital, the position of the working class has been strengthened. The influence of the eighty-seven Marxist-Leninist parties, which now have 36 million communist party members, has deepened. The working class has greatly expanded the possibility of uniting the majority of the people around itself, isolating the reactionary monopoly aggressive groups in the struggle, and achieving new victories in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

In this situation, the policy of peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems proposed and proven by Lenin has gained greater vitality. This policy is in line with the requirements of contemporary social development and the actual balance of power in the world. It is in the interests of all nations.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and made an extremely important conclusion at its 20th Congress: that at present, war is not inevitably inevitable, and war can be prevented. This conclusion was unanimously supported by the fraternal communist and workers' parties in the programmatic document - the Declaration of the Moscow Meeting of Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries. The points of the Moscow Declaration were reiterated in the communiqué of the Bucharest meeting of Marxist-Leninist parties. The conclusion of the 21st Congress of the CPSU pointed out that "the actual possibility of eliminating world war from the life of human society will arise before the complete victory of socialism on Earth, while capitalism still exists in parts of the world," which is a further development of Marxist-Leninist theory. The starting point for our Party to draw this conclusion is that the new achievements of the socialist camp will further increase the forces for world peace, and the number of countries advocating the consolidation of peace will also increase. Our Party has taken into account that the idea of not allowing war to break out will increasingly deeply take root in the consciousness of the people of all countries, and that they, relying on the power of the socialist camp, will be able to force the imperialist warmongering groups to abandon their plans to launch a new war.

The entire course of events proves that the communists' analysis is correct. The socialist camp, with the support of all peace-loving forces, has more than once prevented the imperialist aggressors from attempting to launch local wars in recent years, through which imperialism threatens humanity with a new world war. This vividly proves that, due to the formation of the world socialist system and the achievements of socialism, the balance of power in the international arena has undergone a fundamental change in favor of socialism and peace advocates. In our era, there has formed in the world the actual force that can stop the imperialist aggressors. Now, imperialism cannot decide at will whether or not a war will occur.

While fighting for peace, Marxists-Leninists, of course, take into account that as long as imperialism exists, the roots of war remain. The reactionary forces representing the interests of capitalist monopoly groups will attempt to launch wars. Imperialism was and still is aggressive, its wolfish nature has not changed now and will not change in the future. Therefore, socialist countries and all peace-loving forces should maintain maximum vigilance and be prepared to give a devastating rebuff if the imperialists dare to lead things to war.

Peace is the most sacred desire of all peoples on Earth. Now, people have no greater desire than to free mankind from the threat of a devastating new war.

But without the struggle for peace, peace cannot be consolidated. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary in our era for socialist countries to implement an active diplomatic policy with the principle of peaceful coexistence as their general line, to further mobilize all peace-loving forces, and to educate the people to believe that a new world war can now be prevented. V.I. Lenin said: "We should help the people of all countries to intervene in the issue of war and peace." Our Party follows this testament of Lenin with the consistent and firm spirit inherent in communists.

In the struggle for peace, our Party also clearly remembers Lenin's instruction: that the victorious socialism primarily influences the fate of mankind with its economic achievements. And these achievements can only be increased under peaceful conditions. There is no doubt that in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism, socialism will inevitably achieve a decisive economic victory and guarantee its people a higher standard of living than it is now. This will more clearly show the superiority of our social system than it is now, and set a strong and inspiring example for the struggle of people of all countries against capitalism and for socialism.

Comrades! We all see that the Soviet government has taken resolute action in defending peace.

The Soviet Union has waged a resolute struggle for the proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, which was supported by the United Nations General Assembly last year. Due to the consistent actions of the Soviet government in the struggle for complete and thorough disarmament, the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee was established. We had hoped that this committee could eliminate the obstacles that had formed in the disarmament negotiations. In January of this year, we passed a law to again unilaterally reduce the Soviet armed forces by 1.2 million people. Economic and cultural ties with many countries have been expanded. We have continued to give selfless assistance to economically underdeveloped countries.

Comrade N.S. Khrushchev's visits to Southeast Asian countries and France, like his trip to the United States last year, have helped to spread a correct understanding of the policies of socialist countries, promoted the health of the international atmosphere, exposed the conspiracies of imperialism, and created a favorable climate for summit meetings.

However, the strengthening of the cause of peace is not in the interests of the imperialist groups, and they do not want international relations to develop in a way that benefits the people. Under pressure from the monopoly capital that seizes huge profits from the arms race, the US government has embarked on a path of direct provocation against our country and against the cause of peace. American air pirates invaded Soviet airspace, and Eisenhower and the US government brazenly claimed that they had the "right" to violate our sovereignty, saying that this was to protect their "security." The US government sent us spy planes, but refused to honestly admit the crimes of these bandit acts, thereby destroying the summit meetings. The Western countries adopted an intolerable delaying tactic and were unwilling to conduct serious disarmament negotiations, which made it impossible for socialist countries to continue participating in the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee. The imperialists issued new signals of the "Cold War" in order to promote the arms race and incite the frenzy of preparing for war.

However, implementing this policy in international relations will not portend anything good for the imperialists.

We are certainly not afraid of the bellicose clamor of the aggressors. The era of implementing the imperialist policy of giving orders has passed. Now the strength is on our side. The working people of the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp are doing well in developing their own strong economies and are committed to strengthening their own defense forces.

When American spy planes (it should be said, these are the best planes in the United States) appeared in our sky, they were shot down to the ground and turned into fragments, and at the same time, they shot down the arrogance of the American militarists. We have firmly said in the past and we say now that it will continue to be so in the future. Our folk saying is good, "The soldiers on the front line and the soldiers on the labor front are all soldiers in the vanguard." If anyone tries to test our power again, he will get the retribution he deserves. Comrade Khrushchev said: "Today we are strong and powerful, and tomorrow we will be even stronger. Gentlemen, you will no longer be able to wait for the time when you mocked us for being weak."

The current international situation is such that the Soviet Union, the socialist countries, and the peace-loving peoples of all countries can calm down those arsonists who are overly fond of war.

While we expose the imperialist policy, we confront it with a realistic program of peace and international cooperation.

Imperialism is stepping up the arms race. We have put forward a constructive proposal for complete and thorough disarmament, and we firmly believe that this is the key to all pressing issues of modern times. At the UN General Assembly and in other speeches in New York, Comrade Khrushchev thoroughly refuted the lies of the bourgeois propaganda machine, which said that the Soviet Union was unwilling to supervise disarmament. He said, "As long as you accept disarmament, we will accept any supervision."

West German revanchists (and some people are now trying to give them modern weapons) openly put forward territorial demands and threaten to wage war in the center of Europe. We demand that the Bonn militarists be restrained, and we call for the conclusion of a peace treaty with the two Germanies based on the actual situation that has formed since World War II, and we insist on abolishing the outdated occupation status of West Berlin. It is already time for the Western countries to finally understand our position and stop testing the patience of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.

We suggest that Western countries hold honest state-to-state negotiations on disputes in international relations. We believe that this is an extremely wise way to ease international tension. Some leaders of Western countries, including British Prime Minister Macmillan, have more than

    关于伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年
    科兹洛夫在莫斯科庆祝十月革命四十三周年大会上的报告
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科6日电：科兹洛夫1960年11月6日在莫斯科举行的伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年庆祝大会上的报告，全文如下：亲爱的同志们！尊敬的外国来宾们！
    光辉的、愉快的节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年到来了。我们的兄弟——强大的社会主义阵营的各国人民、所有国家的劳动人民、整个进步人类都在同苏联人一道庆祝这个伟大的节日。
    同志们，请允许我代表苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联政府、全体苏联人民，代表我们这个庆祝会的参加者，热烈欢迎在座的社会主义国家代表团的领导人和成员、兄弟共产党和工人党的领导人以及到莫斯科来同我们一道庆祝伟大的十月革命四十三周年的所有来宾。
    请允许我通过我们的亲爱的外国朋友向高举不可战胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜和继续十月革命伟大事业的所有兄弟共产党和工人党致衷心的敬意，向所有的劳动人民、世界上所有的普通人们、所有争取和平、民主、争取民族解放、争取社会主义的战士致热情的敬意。
    同志们！
    每当我们隆重庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命节的时候，我们每个人都为苏联人民在共产党的领导下所树立的史无前例的功绩而感到自豪，都由于看到我们在迅速前进的又一年中取得的辉煌胜利而感到高兴。
    现在，当全世界都看到苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所制定的我国共产主义建设的宏伟纲领正在如何顺利地实现的时候，我们特别强烈地为我们伟大的人民、为我们美好的祖国、为列宁主义的共产党而感到高度的自豪。
    人类的优秀思想家曾经预言共产主义必然胜利，而现在，它正在我们这里从劳动人民的光辉理想变为现实。这就是四十三年来苏维埃国家发展道路的主要总结，也是作为自己国家的统治者和自己命运的自由的和自觉的创造者的苏联人民的英雄劳动的主要总结。
    十月革命揭开了新的历史时代——资本主义崩溃和社会主义、共产主义在世界范围内胜利的时代。伟大十月的崇高思想鼓舞着世界各地的劳动人民和被剥削者起来同他们世世代代的敌人——压迫者作斗争，这个思想从根本上动摇了雇佣奴隶制度——资本主义制度。
    在1917年10月诞生的苏维埃国家，曾经在许多年内在资本主义包围的条件下建设社会主义，击退了帝国主义者的猖狂进攻。在第二次世界大战胜利结束后，当最反动的帝国主义势力被击溃后，在世界上发生了具有重大历史意义的事件。继苏联之后，欧洲和亚洲又有许多国家走上了社会主义的道路。强大的社会主义阵营现在拥有十亿多人口——占人类的三分之一以上。在民族解放运动的打击之下，可耻的殖民主义制度正在彻底崩溃；许多殖民地和附属国的人民取得了民族独立。帝国主义的势力范围现在大大地缩小了。十月革命的思想给亿万人们带来了自由和幸福。它将给予全人类自由和幸福。
    由伟大的十月社会主义革命开始的资本主义向社会主义的过渡构成了现时代的主要内容。
    在我们这个星球上，各个角落的亿万人们都把解决像保障巩固和平、全面彻底裁军、消灭殖民主义这样一些迫切的社会政治问题的可能性，同苏联、同整个社会主义阵营、同共产主义思想联系在一起。我们苏维埃国家是和平的喉舌和捍卫者，它表达着各国人民的希望，坚决和满怀信心地举起进步的旗帜。各国人民的意识中这样一种信念越来越深：社会主义和共产主义的道路是社会发展唯一正确的道路，它能使劳动人民摆脱毁灭性战争，给劳动人民带来高度的物质福利和真正的自由。
    苏联光荣地履行自己崇高的国际主义职责，各国劳动人民和所有爱好和平国家人民的切身利益的一贯的坚定不移的捍卫者的职责。苏联代表团及其领导人赫鲁晓夫同志在联合国大会第十五届会议上的卓越活动，鲜明地证实了这一点。
    赫鲁晓夫同志以及许多社会主义国家的卓越的国家活动家积极地参加联大第十五届会议，使这届会议变成了意义非常重要的国际事件。苏联建议必须在联合国讨论这样一些问题：全面彻底裁军、消灭殖民主义和给一切国家和人民以独立，这些建议和我们的其他一些建议得到社会主义国家和一系列中立国家代表团的热烈支持。这是完全可以理解的，因为苏联提出讨论的是对这一代和下一代的命运具有重大意义的当代国际生活中的迫切问题。清风吹进了联合国的墙壁，清除掉联合国大厅中的霉湿和郁滞的气息。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的充满革命热情和基于对我们事业的正确性的伟大信念的发言，撕下了瞒哄人民的帝国主义骗子手的假面具，揭露了他们敌视和平的立场。帝国主义者在自己家里就感受到了共产主义逻辑和真理的不可抗拒，让他们和他们的仆从们去奔走狂号吧。苏联、社会主义和进步的力量又对帝国主义力量取得了一次重大的道义上和政治上的胜利，争取到了千百万新的朋友。这是我们列宁主义外交政策的必然结果，这个政策渗透了生气勃勃的十月思想，它从列宁的时代起，还从来没有像现在这样具有积极的意义和坚定的目标。
    苏联代表团和它的团长赫鲁晓夫同志在联合国大会第十五届会议上的活动，得到全体苏联人、社会主义各国人民和整个进步人类的热烈支持。
    苏联人民和我们党认为自己对各国劳动人民所承担的国际主义义务是：进一步加强苏联的威力，加强社会主义阵营以及国际工人运动和共产主义运动的团结和力量。我国人民及其在斗争和劳动中经过考验的先锋队——光荣的共产党，今后仍将把自己的一切力量贡献给伟大的共产主义事业，贡献给争取世界和平的斗争。
    共产主义的强大步伐
    同志们！
    伟大十月革命思想所照耀的我们的生活又过去了一年。这是苏联人民取得新的杰出成就的一年。现在，我们所有的人都能够满意地说，我们国内情况从没有过这样的巩固和充满希望。赫鲁晓夫曾给我国生活作过简短的、但是十分精辟的评价。他说：“我们苏联拥有一切必要的东西。我们的国家是一个经济繁荣的富强国家。我们努力提高我国人民的生活水平。我们有极其美好的前景。除了友谊之外，我们不需要从别国人民那里得到任何东西。我们拥有一切满足人民需求所必需的东西。”
    站在无产阶级革命胜利后所经历的四十三年的顶峰，我们可以清楚地看到，我国在这几十年中所走过的艰难道路和我们胜利的伟大。
    在年轻的苏维埃共和国刚刚开始和平的社会主义建设的时期，伟大的领袖、共产党和我们国家的奠基人弗·伊·列宁曾感叹地谈到国家经济的落后，谈到在我国广阔的幅员上，笼罩着宗法制度的残余、半开化状态和真正野蛮的现象。就是他，我们亲爱的伊里奇预言，苏维埃俄罗斯必然要变成一个真正强大的和富裕的俄罗斯。
    列宁的预言应验了。共产党的英明和远见，它的正确领导，以及英勇的工人阶级、光荣的集体农民和人民知识分子年复一年的顽强劳动和忘我斗争，使我们祖国变成了强大的社会主义国家。
    伟大的十月革命第四十三年为国家增添了很多成就。列宁主义关于利用社会主义制度的无限可能性来加速向共产主义迈进的政策，在我国得到坚定不移的贯彻。这个政策在党的第二十一次代表大会的具有历史意义的决议中，在苏联发展国民经济七年计划中，在苏共中央和苏联政府为进一步发展工农业和改善对工农业的领导方法、以及为加速技术进步和提高人民物质福利而采取的一系列巨大措施中得到了集中的反映。
    现在，当七年计划的第二年即将结束时，可以对争取完成这个宏伟计划的全民斗争作出某些总结。
    七年计划规定工业产品平均每年增长8.6％。实际上，在1959年增长11％以上。农业劳动者去年也很好地完成了任务。这就扩大和加强了苏维埃社会的物质技术基础，使得能够大大地增加我们的物质资源。
    七年计划的第二年提出的任务比七年计划中规定的更高。虽然这个年头还没有结束，但是有一切根据说，这些提高了的任务也将超额完成。今年头九个月，工业总产值计划完成了103％，按照七年计划的控制数字的计算，1959—1960年我国工业产值应增长17％。而实际上差不多将增长23％，在七年计划的头两年，我们的工业产值将比七年计划所规定的多大约一千二百亿卢布。1960年有一千多个新的大型工业企业投入生产。这样，到七年计划第三年的时候，我们就将拥有更多的潜力。
    农业劳动者所取得的成就是我们大家都清楚知道的。最近六年来，我们农业生产总值增加为一倍半。集体农庄和国营农场为了进一步增加生产，把1960年收获的农作物的播种面积扩大了七百万公顷。可喜的是，国家现在从集体农庄和国营农场不仅得到谷类作物和工业原料作物的全部商品性产品，并且得到绝大部分的畜牧业商品性产品。
    集体农民和国营农场的工人今年也同样进行了顽强的劳动。应当说，现在的天气是罕见地变化莫测：南部地区由于冰冻和大风而损失了一部分冬季作物，哈萨克和西伯利亚由于春季漫长、夏季寒冷而受到了影响。尽管如此，国家收购谷物的数量将不会减少，而甜菜、向日葵和蔬菜比去年还要有所增加。六、七年以前，天气不好对我们的粮食平衡和居民的粮食供应还发生过严重的影响。现在这种情况没有了。我们现在比几年以前受自然现象的影响更少了。这令人信服地证明了党关于急剧地提高农业、进一步加强集体农庄制度的措施的高度有效性。
    我们党中央委员会和苏联政府今后仍要不倦地工作，以便使国家一年一年地不断得到日益增多的粮食和工业用的农业原料。定于12月召开的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议将全面地讨论农业发展问题，制定为进一步扩大农产品生产而斗争的道路。
    我国劳动人民在准备隆重地迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年和苏共中央十二月全会期间，取得了不少光辉的胜利。
    昨天我们大家都看到了俄罗斯联邦农业劳动者取得巨大成绩的消息，他们完成了向国家交售粮食的计划。他们向祖国交售了十八亿零一百万普特谷物，这个数字比1959年全年的交售额多一亿五千八百万普特。可喜的是，在这些商品粮食中，垦荒地区收获量占十亿零八千九百万普特。俄罗斯联邦的集体农庄和国营农场今年交售的玉蜀黍比去年多二点二倍，提前完成了出售肉类的年度计划，向国家提供的肉类比1959年同期多二十八万一千吨。全体苏联人都为俄罗斯联邦各族人民的这些卓越成就而骄傲。
    白俄罗斯共和国的农业劳动者提前完成了向国家交售谷物、肉类、奶类和蛋类的计划。在这个共和国征购的奶类比去年同一时期多十二万二千吨，而征购的马铃薯比1959年全年征购的总额多三十五万吨。我们所有的人都对白俄罗斯人民的这些成就感到十分满意。
    我国的其他共和国在农业发展中也取得了不小的成就。
    1960年标志着许多新的科学成就和发明。其中最杰出的是：带有生物的重型宇宙飞船飞到宇宙并返回地球。苏联科学家、工程师和工人这一卓越的功勋再一次地证实了苏联科学在许多知识领域内的冠军地位。
    在和平利用原子能方面，苏联科学的成就是众所周知的。在超导性的理论、音响学、固体强度物理学和超高压方面也取得了巨大成果。化学家在制造新的物质和材料方面，首先是在制造能够代替钢和其他金属的塑料方面的研究工作是极有成效的。
    科学技术的成就使我们现在能够在空前短的期间内解决国民经济的重要任务。在五、六个月内，建成一座大平炉，在八、九个月内建成一座高炉，这已经是平凡的事了。水泥厂的建设者们在六个月至八个月中就能建成强大的转炉的综合技术规程作业线。
    现在，我们以更快得多的速度进行着水电站的建设。11月4日，全国都知道了第聂伯河上的巨大的胜利。建设者比原定期限提前两年使总发电能力为六十二万五千瓩的克列门楚格水电站投入了生产。这样就为实现伟大的列宁关于我国电气化的遗嘱作出了新的贡献。
    而机器制造业是多么信心百倍地阔步前进！我来举个例子。在几年前，我们曾十分自豪地说，我们制造了供伏尔加河水电站用的功率为十一万五千瓩的转齿涡轮机。现在，机器制造者为布拉次克水电站制造了举世无双的功率为二十二万五千瓩的放射轴涡轮机，并且正在研究五十万瓩的水轮机。在七年计划的头一年半内，制造出了三千多种新型机器、机床、机械和仪器。
    科学、技术和工业建设的无可争辩的成就使得有可能迅速增加生产能力，从而使工业品每年的绝对增长额不断增加。
    这是一个自然的过程，是共产主义建设规律之一的反映，正如尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在第二十一次党代表大会上所说的那样，这一规律就是：“向共产主义的逐步过渡决不能理解为某种缓慢的运动”，不能“拘限于既得的东西，因为这样将会陷于停滞”。
    建立共产主义物质技术基础的速度之所以不断增长，还由于人民的文化技术水平在迅速上升，他们的共产主义觉悟在日益提高。
    苏联人现在对待自己的劳动是采用比以往更高的另外一种标准。他们不愿容忍个别的生产单位落在后边和发挥不出自己的潜力这样一种现象。所以，有许多生产革新者和有经验的组织者纷纷自愿到落后单位去，把这些单位带入先进单位的行列。共产主义劳动运动正在日益扩大和日益深入。现在已经有许多工厂、矿井、油田和工地，正在为争取共产主义劳动集体的光荣称号而进行竞赛。
    所有这一切事实说明什么呢？由此可以得出什么样的结论呢？
    第一，我们现在可以有把握地说，苏联人将提前完成七年计划。
    第二，苏联在同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中正在一年比一年赢得更多的时间，因而我们满怀信心：我们定将在最短的历史时期内赶上并超过经济最发达的资本主义国家。
    在工业生产方面，苏联早已跃居世界第二位而仅次于美国。然而我们现在前进的速度是美国所达不到的。在战后的十六年期间，苏联的工业生产平均每年增长10.7％，而美国平均每年增长1.8％。
    但是，事情不仅仅在于增长的百分比，我们正在满怀信心地在工业品的每年绝对增长额和在工业品的总产值方面赶上美国。革命前的俄国所生产的工业品比美国少八分之七。现在苏联的工业生产的产值为美国的60％，而农业产值为75—80％。苏联在铁矿和煤的开采量方面，在焦炭、干线车厢、谷物收割联合机、锯材、毛织品、动物油和糖的生产方面已经超过了美国。我们当然知道，美国的一系列工业部门仍然走在我们的前面。但是我们在绝对产量方面把美国抛在后面的那些产品的“品种”将一年比一年增多。
    我们向前发展的速度、我们在国民经济各个部门中所取得的成就使我们毫不怀疑，同资本主义进行经济竞赛的前景，对我们来说是极其美好的。世界上凡是能够冷静地估价世界舞台上的力量对比和社会主义制度的无限潜力的、头脑清醒的人们，也越来越看清这一点。
    但是，在资本主义的辩护人当中还有一些死硬派，他们白费心机地对无可辩驳的东西散布怀疑。例如，美国总统候选人尼克松在不久前说，苏联速度和美国速度的对比，“好像是儿童身体的成长和成年人的智慧成长的速度的比较”。这真像俗话所说：“谁要尝了胆汁，谁的嘴里总是苦的”。对尼克松先生说来，不幸的是：尽管他追求形象的但是缺乏说服力的对比，而他本人却像个“专心”捉蝴蝶的小孩，没有看到周围有别的东西。尼克松先生不愿意考虑：健康的、结实的孩子早已长大成人了，并且正在树立那些具有所谓“成年人的智慧”的人们直到现在还无能树立的丰功伟绩。
    在揭露帝国主义仆从们费尽气力地颠倒黑白的同时，我们说：社会主义经济是年轻的、充满力量和健康的机体，而资本主义经济是个老朽的人，无论用什么丸散膏丹也不能使他摆脱不治之症。
    共产主义是世界的真正的青春，资本主义是世界的昨天。这就是客观的真理，这就是历史的规律。
    不错，资本主义国家的船长们不承认这一客观的真理，不愿意考虑事实。尤其是，他们还企图硬充好汉。但是，生活在鞭笞他们。艾森豪威尔总统在1月发表的国情咨文中保证：1960年将是美国“空前繁荣”的一年。但是，美国实业界的刊物“商业周刊”到8月就已经不得不承认，今年美国许多经济部门出现了明显的衰退，它沮丧地说：“实业的积极性不按照艾森豪威尔所写的脚本出现”。
    苏联在钢的生产方面迅速地追赶着美国，这使美国人特别感到不安。我们应该说，他们的这种不安是完全有道理的。1945年苏联的钢产量只等于美国生产水平的17％；而1959年我们钢产量达到了美国产量的71％。而大家都知道，钢的产量是国家实力的基本标志之一。
    我们党和全体苏联人民坚信，在同资本主义的和平经济竞赛中我国将在不久的将来取得胜利。这是必然的，正像黑夜之后清晨必然来临一样。
    但是，苏联人永远不会满足于已经取得的一切，永远不会陶醉于成就。我们有一个良好的习惯，这就是集中精力去完成新的更大的任务。
    现在，共产党提出了一项具有头等重要意义的事业——在工业、建筑业、集体农庄、国营农场和运输业，在国民经济的各个部门，提高质量指标。问题不只在于产品的质量。当然，苏联企业的商标本来就是每一台机器和每一件产品的可靠的保证。我现在是指广义的质量指标而言。现在，当总产值的计划任务通常是完成并超额完成的时候，各级党、苏维埃、工会和经济组织的注意中心应当是提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本和建筑价格、增加积累的问题，应当是技术进步、生产的自动化和全盘机械化、更合理地利用投资。
    在农业方面，我们今后仍将争取提高所有田间作物的单位面积产量和畜牧业的产品生产率，争取更有效地使用技术设备，不断降低为生产每公担谷物、棉花、蔬菜、肉类和牛奶所支出的劳动量。
    同志们！我们党在发动人民进行十月革命时曾说过，只有社会主义和共产主义才能保证充分地和全面地满足劳动人民的物质和精神要求。为此，我们过去和现在都在建造工厂、电站，加快经济建设的速度，发展文化各部门。而这，现在正在结出丰硕的果实。在苏维埃土地上，生活正变得越来越愉快和幸福！
    在这方面，社会主义革命在俄国取得胜利后的第四十三年是很有特色的。在国民收入增长的基础上，1953年到1960年这一期间苏联居民的实际收入增加了一半以上。所有职工向六、七小时工作日的过渡正在完成，从11月1日起，有约五千万人已经过渡到缩短了的工作日。消费品的生产不断增加。从10月1日起，开始逐步取消职工赋税。我们祖国正在满怀信心地朝着世界最高的人民生活水平迈进。
    共产党和苏联政府特别注意社会消费基金的增长。这是提高苏联人民生活福利的极其重要的共产主义途径。到七年计划结束时，国家用于国民教育、医疗设施、社会保险及其它社会消费方面的支出，按每个工作人员平均计算，将达每人每年三千八百卢布左右，即每人每月三百卢布以上。这是对职工的工资和集体农民的收入的相当可观的“补加”。到七年计划结束时，国家用于建设住宅、学校、文化生活和医疗机构的拨款，按每个工作人员平均计算，将达每人一年八百多卢布。
    党和政府对改善苏联人民生活条件的始终不断的关怀还可以从下列事实得到说明：从1957年到1960年（包括1960年在内），在城市和工人居住区建设的住房总面积几乎达三亿平方米。拿革命前的俄国来作比较，那时，全国所有城市和工人居住区住房的总面积只不过一亿八千万平方米左右。
    同志们！我们有权利指出我们在经济、文化、科学和技术方面所取得的伟大成就。但是，使我们更感到自豪的是我们国土上所有的一切美好和伟大的事物的创造者——苏维埃人。苏维埃人的光辉的精神世界、对共产主义事业的忘我忠诚、对劳动的热爱和尊重、集体主义——所有这一切只有在社会主义制度的条件下，在为发挥创造才能提供真正自由的条件下，才能培养出来。
    我国伟大的文化革命是同巨大的经济改造不可分割地统一进行的。由于这一文化革命，在苏维埃国家中，有学识的和受过教育的一代成长起来了。在培养许多专业的专门人材、首先是工程师方面，我们早已占居世界第一位。党所执行的并受到全国人民拥护的教育同生产劳动相结合的路线，以及使具有中等和高等教育水平的人们大规模地投入物质生产的做法，在消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的重大差别方面正在取得显著的成果。
    党在群众中进行巨大的教育工作所取得的杰出成果，就是我国人民接受了马克思列宁主义，作为自己的世界观。苏联人民完全领会党的建设社会主义和共产主义的路线，并且自觉地建设社会主义和共产主义。
    在什么地方，在哪一个资本主义国家里，会有像千百万年轻的爱国者自愿去开垦荒地，自愿走向东部新建工程那样的伟大意志和精神？无私地帮助共同工作的同志已成为常规，什么地方会有这样的事呢？无报酬地义务完成往往需要花费不少精力和时间的种种重要事情，这样的事什么地方会有呢？只有在社会主义社会，这些才会牢固地进入人们的日常生活！
    同志们，你们大家一定读过尼基塔·谢尔盖耶维奇·赫鲁晓夫给坦波夫州“格鲁霍夫斯基”国营农场养猪员米哈伊尔·安德列耶维奇·鲁卡什金——前苏军少校的热情的贺电。鲁卡什金同志没有去寻找“挣钱的”和“安逸的”工作，没有追求高职显位。他自愿地投入了那些创造物质财富的人的光荣行列，并取得了出色的成绩。
    从这件事以及其他许多类似的事实中，可以看出苏维埃人的心灵的美，他对社会的高度的责任感！
    今后仍要以共产主义精神教育人民，坚决根除一部分——虽然是很小一部分——苏联人身上还保留的旧时代的旧残余，这是我们思想工作的一项极其重要的任务。
    建立共产主义的物质技术基础，在这一基础上发展共产主义的社会关系，造就和培养新人——这就是共产主义建设的主要的、彼此相关联的任务。我们正在顺利地解决这些任务。在我们面前展现着越来越宏伟的前景。我们正在充满信心地前进，向新的胜利前进。
      争取和平的斗争
    是现代最重要的任务
    同志们！社会主义（伟大的十月革命宣告了它在我国的到来）现在已成为一个世界体系。在所向无敌的马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，伟大的中国人民、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古、波兰、罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克各国人民，现在都同苏联一道在确立新的生活。
    社会主义越出一国的范围，这是劳动和资本之间长期斗争中的一个最伟大的胜利。这个胜利使全人类的政治生活、经济生活和思想生活发生了根本的变化。帝国主义普遍统治的时代已经一去不复返了。世界社会主义体系的形成，是伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利后最重大的历史事件，这个体系正在成为人类社会发展的决定性因素。
    在国际舞台上还出现了一类国家，它们不愿绝对地听命于帝国主义国家。在反对殖民主义者的顽强斗争中已经取得独立或正在争取独立的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民，越来越积极地参与国际生活，对削弱帝国主义的阵地作出自己的贡献。
    在垄断资本的国家里，工人阶级的阵地加强了。现在拥有三千六百万共产党员的八十七个马克思列宁主义政党的影响加深了。工人阶级大大地扩大了把人民的大多数团结在自己的周围、在斗争中孤立反动的垄断侵略集团、在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中取得新的胜利的可能性。
    在这种情况下，列宁所提出并论证的不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策获得了更大的生命力。这一政策符合当代社会发展的要求和世界上力量的实际对比情况。它符合所有各国人民的利益。
    苏联共产党创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，在它的第二十次代表大会上作出了一个极重要的结论：目前，战争不是注定不可避免的，战争是能够防止的。在具有纲领意义的文件——社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议的宣言中，这一结论得到了各兄弟共产党和工人党的一致支持。在马克思列宁主义政党的布加勒斯特会议的公报中，又重申了莫斯科宣言的论点。苏共第二十一次代表大会的结论指出，“在社会主义还没有在地球上完全胜利以前，在资本主义还在世界部分地区存在的时候，就会出现把世界大战从人类社会生活中消除掉的实际可能性”，这一结论是对马克思列宁主义理论的进一步发展。我们党得出这一结论的出发点是：社会主义阵营的新成就将使世界和平力量得到进一步的增长，而主张巩固和平的国家的数目也将增加。我们的党考虑到了：不容许战争爆发的思想将日益深入地在各国人民的意识中扎下根子，他们只要凭借社会主义阵营的威力，就能够迫使帝国主义好战集团放弃发动新战争的计划。
    事态的整个过程证明共产党人的分析是正确的。社会主义阵营在所有爱好和平的力量的支持下，近几年来不止一次地制止了帝国主义侵略者发动局部战争的企图，帝国主义通过这种局部战争，用新的世界大战威胁人类。这鲜明地证明，由于世界社会主义体系的形成和社会主义的成就，国际范围内的力量对比发生了有利于社会主义和和平拥护者的根本变化。在我们的时代里，世界上形成了能够制止帝国主义侵略者的实际力量。现在，帝国主义不能随心所欲地决定——发生或者不发生战争。
    马克思列宁主义者在为和平而斗争的同时，当然考虑到，只要存在着帝国主义，就保持着发生战争的根源。代表资本主义垄断集团利益的反动势力会企图发动战争。帝国主义过去是、现在仍然是侵略性的，它的豺狼的本性现在没有变，将来也不会变。因此，社会主义国家、一切爱好和平的力量应该保持最大的警惕，并准备着，如果帝国主义者竟敢把事情引向战争，就给以毁灭性的回击。
    和平是地球上一切人民的最神圣的愿望。现在，人们再没有比使人类摆脱毁灭性新战争威胁更大的愿望了。
    但是，没有争取和平的斗争，和平是不能巩固的。因此，社会主义国家实现以和平共处原则作为其总路线的积极外交政策，进一步动员一切爱好和平的力量，教育人民相信，现在是可以防止新的世界大战的，所有这一切都是我们这个时代的绝对必要。弗·伊·列宁说过：“我们应该帮助各国人民干预战争与和平问题。”我们党就是以共产党人所固有的始终不渝和坚定的精神遵循着列宁的这一遗训的。
    我们党在争取和平的斗争中也清楚地记着列宁的这样一个指示：已经取得胜利的社会主义以自己在经济方面的成就给人类的命运以主要的影响。而这种成就只有在和平的条件下才能增加。毫无疑问，在同资本主义进行和平经济竞赛的过程中，社会主义必将取得决定性的经济胜利，保证自己国家的人民有比现在更高的生活水平。这就能比现在更加明显地显示出我们社会制度的优越性，为世界各国人民反对资本主义和争取社会主义的斗争树立强大的令人鼓舞的榜样。
    同志们！我们大家都看到，苏联政府在保卫和平方面采取了坚决的行动。
    苏联为实现在去年得到联合国大会支持的全面彻底裁军建议进行了坚决的斗争。由于苏联政府在争取全面彻底裁军斗争中的一贯行动，成立了十国裁军委员会。我们曾经希望这个委员会能排除裁军谈判中形成的障碍。今年1月，我们通过了再次单方面裁减苏联武装部队一百二十万人的法律。同很多国家的经济往来和文化联系已经扩大。我们继续给了经济不发达国家以无私的援助。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志对东南亚国家和法国的访问，同他去年的美国之行一样，都有助于传播对社会主义国家政策的正确理解，促进了国际气氛的健康化，揭露了帝国主义的阴谋诡计，为最高级会议创造了有利的气候。
    可是，和平事业的加强不合帝国主义集团的心意，它们不希望国际关系得到有利于人民的发展。美国政府在从军备竞赛中攫取巨额利润的垄断资本的压力下，走上了对我国、对和平事业直接挑衅的道路。美国空中强盗侵入了苏联领空，艾森豪威尔和美国政府竟然厚颜无耻地宣称有“权利”破坏我们的主权，说什么这是为了保卫他们的“安全”。美国政府既向我们派遣了间谍飞机，可是又不愿老老实实地承认干下这些强盗行为的罪行，因而就破坏了最高级会议。西方国家施行不可容忍的拖延手法，不愿进行认真的裁军谈判，这使得社会主义国家不可能继续参加十国裁军委员会。帝国主义者发出了新的“冷战”讯号，以便推进军备竞赛和煽起准备战争的热狂。
    但是，在国际关系中执行这种政策，对帝国主义者来说是不会预兆什么好结果的。
    我们当然不怕侵略者的好战叫嚣。实行发号施令的帝国主义政策的时代已经过去了。现在力量是在我们这一边。苏联和社会主义阵营各国的劳动人民很好地从事于发展本国的强大经济，致力于加强自己的国防力量。
    当美国的间谍飞机（应该说，这是美国最好的飞机）出现在我们的天空时，它们被打落到地面，变成碎片了，同时也打下了美国黩武主义者的气焰。我们过去和现在都坚决地说，今后仍将如此。我们的民间谚语说得好，“前线上的战士和劳动战线上的战士都是先进行列中的战士”。如果谁企图再来试探我们的威力，他就将得到应有的报应。赫鲁晓夫同志说过：“今天我们是强大有力的，明天我们将更加强大，先生们，你们再也等不到你们讥笑我们软弱的时代了”。
    今天的国际局势是这样的：苏联、各社会主义国家和爱好和平的各国人民能够使那些过分贪恋战争的纵火者冷静下来。
    我们一方面揭穿帝国主义政策，一方面用和平和国际合作的现实纲领同它对抗。
    帝国主义正在加紧进行军备竞赛。我们提出了全面彻底裁军的建设性建议，我们坚信，这是现代一切迫切问题的关键所在。赫鲁晓夫同志在联大会议上和在纽约的其他讲话中彻底击破了资产阶级宣传机构的谎言，即说什么苏联不愿意对裁军进行监督。他说，“只要你们接受裁军，我们就接受任何监督。”
    西德复仇主义分子（现在有人正竭力把现代化武器交给他们）公然提出领土要求，在欧洲中心以制造战争进行威胁。我们要求约束波恩军国主义者，呼吁根据第二次世界大战以后所形成的实际状况同两个德国缔结和约，坚持取消西柏林的业已过时的占领地位。已经是西方国家应该终于理解我们的立场，不再试验苏联和其他爱好和平国家的忍耐性的时候了。
    我们建议西方国家就国际关系中的争端举行诚实的国家之间的谈判。我们认为，这是缓和国际紧张局势的极其明智的途径。西方国家的某些领导人，其中包括英国首相麦克米伦先生，曾经不只一次地表示赞成举行这种谈判的适宜性。但是，英国政府最近的一些措施却使我们深深怀疑麦克米伦先生说英国政府期望缓和国际紧张局势这样的话是否是真诚的。
    就在几天以前，麦克米伦先生在议会宣布了英美两国签订一项协定的事情，根据这一协定，美国的海军将在苏格兰、在离英国的第二大城市格拉斯哥不远的地方获得一个基地，供以火箭武器和核武器装备起来的美国潜水艇舰队使用。这一基地建成以后，将作为用火箭—核武器装备起来的美国原子潜水艇舰队的出击点。美国军事司令部计划把这些潜水艇派往苏联海岸附近活动。
    谁不清楚这是美国企图大大加剧国际局势的极其危险的冒险行为，这种行为将给美国战争鼓吹者及其英国同盟者招致严重的后果。
    值得注意的是，关于建立这一基地的谈判是麦克米伦先生在美国参加联合国大会第十五届会议的时候进行的，而在联大的这次会议上所讨论的主要问题之一是裁军问题。他同美国人讨论了基地问题。麦克米伦先生又同苏联代表团讨论了关于通过谈判来解决已成熟的国际问题的必要性的问题。这样看来，英国政府企图一下子朝着两个截然相反的方向走去。
    显然，这些行动是彼此协调不起来的。英国政府口头上主张缓和紧张局势，而实际上却积极参加美国黩武主义者旨在加剧国际局势、破坏谈判或者把谈判变成继续进行核军备竞赛的幌子的挑衅行动。
    更不用说，英国领导人的这种行动更加牢固地把英国绑在美国的战车上，美国那些喜欢冒险的陆海军将领们正在力图驾驭这辆战车。这种行动使英国本身在一旦发生冲突的时候遭到更大的危险。英美两国签订关于在英国建立美国潜水艇基地的协议的消息引起了英国公众强烈的不安，这不是偶然的。看来，英国公众比英国的领导人更加关心自己国家的命运。
    同志们！立即消灭殖民主义残余，对各国人民的历史命运具有非常伟大的意义，殖民主义还在扼杀千百万人。不能再容忍这种可耻现象继续存在了。
    苏联政府建议在联合国通过关于给予殖民地国家和人民独立的宣言，这一建议是时代的迫切要求，是人类良心的呼声。帝国主义国家某些著名的人物力图削弱苏联的这一建议对世界公众所产生的巨大印象，力图贬低宣言对殖民地和附属国的人民的巨大的吸引力，并且企图证明，仿佛除了在殖民地“煽动暴乱”之外，宣言中没有别的东西。这种警察尺度只适用于为数非常有限的那些恶毒的人们，他们不愿意看到世界上在发生巨大变化，而只承认自己的利润、自己的掠夺他国人民的“权利”。但是，这种权利是没有的。这不是权利，而是胡作非为，各国人民都反对它！
    苏联政府用它的维护和平的建议推动了和大大扩大了为争取和平解决极尖锐的国际问题而斗争的阵线。今天，世界各地的人们都更清楚地看到为争取和平、自由、争取各国人民自己决定自己的命运的神圣权利而斗争的道路。
    苏联、各社会主义国家的积极外交政策以及和平运动的成就，已经产生了可观的结果。帝国主义政策正遭到深刻的危机。美帝国主义——仇恨各国人民的军国主义和殖民主义的堡垒，在道义上和政治上日益孤立。南朝鲜李承晚的血腥统治的被推翻，土耳其公开亲美的拜亚尔—曼德列斯政权的垮台，日本人民反对日美军事同盟的怒潮，非洲各国人民民族解放运动的高涨，这一切都证明了这一点。
    为英雄的古巴的榜样所鼓舞的拉丁美洲各国人民的斗争正在扩大。所有这一切意味着，帝国主义的阵地在继续削弱，而为和平、为各国人民的民族独立、为社会主义而斗争的战士的阵地越来越坚固了。
    同志们！伟大的社会主义阵营的各个国家和人民的团结，以及所有共产党和工人党的团结，是地球上建立巩固和平和劳动人民在反帝斗争中取得新胜利的最重要的条件。我们的党和我国人民不吝惜力量来加强这种团结。
    以马克思列宁主义理论武装起来的共产党员把列宁的下列原理作为自己的指南，这就是：“只有对这一时代的基本特征的了解，才能成为考虑这个或那个国家较详细的特点的基础”。列宁的这一卓越的指示是认识国际共产主义运动的每支队伍的国际任务和民族任务并把两种任务正确地结合起来的基础。共产党员是为本国人民的根本的民族利益而斗争的最坚定的战士。同时，他们反映着整个劳动人类的共同利益和目标。忠实于创造性的马克思主义原则，善于在新的历史环境中正确地理解和运用列宁主义以及国际主义的团结——这就是国际共产主义运动和工人运动的伟大力量之所在。
    共产党和工人党的兄弟团结，社会主义国家的友谊和互助，这是社会主义阵营国家之所以不可战胜的源泉，是它们胜利地走向社会主义和共产主义的保证。
    忠于马克思列宁主义的苏联共产党、我国政府和我国劳动人民，将坚定不移地加强社会主义阵营的团结和威力，加强国际共产主义运动和工人运动的团结，严格地奉行不同社会制度国家和平共处的列宁主义政策，加强各国人民的友谊。
    同志们！苏联人知道，他们所取得的一切成就和他们美好的未来都应该归功于共产党的英明领导。我国人民热爱自己的亲爱的党，正像列宁所说的，他们信任这个党，把它看作是我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。
    共产党由于自己队伍的磐石般的团结，由于对马克思列宁主义的无限忠诚，由于创造性地对待这一伟大的革命学说，由于对修正主义地歪曲这一学说或教条主义地使这一学说僵化的任何做法采取毫不妥协的态度，因而取得了并正在取得胜利。
    党的多方面的全部工作是建筑在使理论和实践有机地结合起来这一列宁主义原则基础上的。党不断地发展马克思列宁主义理论，并以符合历史情况的新的原理和结论来丰富马克思列宁主义理论。党巧妙地把理论体现在明确而具体的政策中，像有经验的舵手一样，善于引导着苏维埃社会走向共产主义。党正确地解决着领导国家经济生活和政治生活的复杂问题，并不断地使社会主义民主完善起来。
    我们党的力量的源泉在于同群众的不可分割的紧密联系，在于它无限地信任人民强大的创造力。同时，苏联人也无限地信任自己亲爱的党，坚定地、勇敢地跟着党走，因为他们根据多年的生活经验知道，党的唯一的最高利益，过去、现在和将来永远都是人民的利益，是劳动人民的幸福。党和人民的目标的一致、意志的一致和行动的一致——这是为共产主义的胜利而斗争的最伟大的力量。
    我们生活、工作和战斗在伟大而光荣的时代——十月革命思想取得胜利、马克思列宁主义思想取得胜利的时代。
    马克思列宁主义和十月革命思想在我国共产主义建设的成就中取得胜利。
    马克思列宁主义和十月革命思想在强大的社会主义阵营不可动摇的团结和不断增长的力量中取得胜利。
    马克思列宁主义和十月革命思想在国际共产主义运动和工人运动的成就中、在日益强大的民族解放运动中、在各国人民争取世界和平的斗争中取得胜利。
    英雄的苏联人民——共产主义建设者万岁！
    光荣的列宁主义的苏联共产党——共产主义建设的一切胜利的鼓舞者和组织者万岁！
    鼓舞着各国人民为全人类光辉的未来——共产主义而斗争的伟大的十月革命的旗帜、马克思列宁主义的旗帜万岁！
