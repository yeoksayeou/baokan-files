Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th: Faced with the grave threat of a rapidly increasing international balance of payments deficit and a swift outflow of gold, U.S. President Eisenhower and other high-ranking officials are anxiously seeking ways to plug the loopholes.

Eisenhower held what American news agencies called an "important meeting" on the 15th with U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Defense Secretary Gates. Anderson and U.S. Under Secretary of State Dillon are about to go to Bonn. Western news agencies have long revealed that they will ask West Germany to bear more of the occupation costs of U.S. troops stationed in West Germany and to bear part of the expenses of U.S. so-called economic "aid" to underdeveloped countries, in order to help the U.S. ease its international payments crisis. After the meeting, Anderson issued a statement openly admitting that they would go to Bonn with this purpose. The statement said that Eisenhower had instructed him to negotiate with Adenauer on the above two issues, and Eisenhower wanted him to express "his personal hope" that this negotiation would be able to "achieve mutually beneficial results." The statement also said, "This is in the interests of the strength of the free world." This tone shows that the U.S. is attempting to use the big stick of the "common interests" of the imperialist camp to pressure Adenauer.

Anderson also announced that Eisenhower is about to issue instructions requiring all U.S. government departments and agencies to "take actions within the scope of their activities in the U.S. government to help reduce our deficit in the balance of international payments."

It is reported that Eisenhower and Anderson also discussed how to deal with the Soviet ruble, which has already announced an increase in value, given that the dollar is increasingly threatened with devaluation.

After Bonn, Anderson and Dillon will also go to Paris and London.

A figure released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on the 15th further illustrated the seriousness of the rapid increase in the U.S. international payments deficit. The Department of Commerce admitted that if calculated according to the U.S. international payments deficit for the July to September quarter of this year, the annual deficit rate would reach 4.3 billion U.S. dollars, while based on the figures for the April to June quarter, the annual deficit rate was only 2.9 billion U.S. dollars.

In fact, July-September were not the most serious months. In October and November, the deficit situation has worsened even further.

    美国国际收支赤字一月比一月巨大
    按第三季情况计算年率高达43亿元
    艾森豪威尔慌忙寻求对策派遣财政部长和副国务卿赴欧求援
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：在国际收支赤字急剧增加、黄金迅速外流的严重威胁下，美国总统艾森豪威尔和其他高级官员正在紧张地寻找堵塞漏洞的办法。
    艾森豪威尔15日同美国财政部长安德逊和国防部长盖茨举行了一次美国通讯社称之为“重要的会议”。安德逊和美国副国务卿狄龙即将去波恩。西方通讯社早就透露，他们将要求西德负担更多的驻西德美军的占领费和负担一部分美国向不发达国家进行所谓经济“援助”的开支，帮美国缓和国际支付危机。会后，安德逊发表声明公开承认，他们将抱着这个目的去波恩。声明说，艾森豪威尔已经指示他同阿登纳谈判上述两个问题，艾森豪威尔要他表达“他个人的希望”，希望这一谈判将能“取得互利结果”。声明还说，“这是符合自由世界实力的利益的”。这种语调表明，美国企图用帝国主义阵营的“共同利益”的大帽子来压阿登纳。
    安德逊还宣布，艾森豪威尔即将发表指示，要美国政府各部门和各机构“采取它们在美国政府活动范围内能够采取的行动，来帮助减少我们在国际支付差额方面的赤字”。
    据报道，艾森豪威尔和安德逊还讨论了日益受到贬值威胁的美元如何对付已经宣布提高价值的苏联卢布的问题。
    安德逊和狄龙到波恩以后还要到巴黎和伦敦去。
    15日美国商务部发表的一个数字进一步说明了美国国际支付赤字急剧增加的严重情况。商务部承认，如果按照今年7月到9月的这一季度的美国国际支付赤字数目计算，今年的赤字年率达四十三亿美元，而照4月到6月这一季度的数字计算，赤字年率还只有二十九亿美元。
    实际上，7—9月还不是最严重的月份。在10月和11月，这种赤字情况已经更加恶化。
