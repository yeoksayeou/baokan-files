Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The China Political Science and Law Society hosted a banquet tonight to welcome the entire Cuban Legal Workers Delegation, led by Santiago Cuba, Attorney General of the Supreme Court of Cuba, who recently visited our country.

    Wu De-feng, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Society, expressed a warm welcome to the guests at the banquet. He said that the Chinese people and the Cuban people are standing on the same front in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and the friendship between the two peoples is solid and eternal. He emphasized that the Chinese people will do everything possible to support the Cuban people's revolution and the struggle against U.S. imperialism, and support the national democratic revolutionary movement of the Latin American people.

    Santiago Cuba, the head of the Cuban Legal Workers Delegation, emphasized in his speech at the banquet that the decisive factor in powerful strength is never weapons, but the most important thing is people. He said that if U.S. imperialism invades us, the Cuban people will resolutely fight to the last drop of blood.

    Santiago Cuba said that the Cuban people have a deep friendship with the Chinese people. The Chinese people are at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and in defense of world peace, and the Cuban people sincerely thank the Chinese people for their support. He said that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Cuban people, and also the enemy of the people of the world. Precisely because the Cuban revolution has won and established friendly relations with China and all socialist countries, U.S. imperialism hates us and wants to invade Cuba every day. However, he said, Cuba is not afraid of threats, and Cuba resolutely stands on its own position and fights U.S. imperialism to the end.

    Present at the banquet tonight were Zhang Zhizhiang, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Society; Ma Xi-wu, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court; Huang Huo-xing, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate; Chu Tu-nan, President of the China-Latin America Friendship Association; Dong Chun-cai, Vice President; and other relevant individuals.

    据新华社19日讯　中国政治法律学会今晚设宴欢迎最近来我国访问的以古巴最高法院检察长圣地亚哥·古巴为首的古巴法律工作者代表团全体成员。
    中国政治法律学会副会长吴德峰在宴会上向客人们表示热烈的欢迎。他说，中国人民同古巴人民站在同一条战线上进行反对美帝国主义的斗争，两国人民的友谊是牢固的、永恒的。他强调说，中国人民将尽一切可能来支援古巴人民的革命和反对美帝国主义的斗争，支持拉丁美洲人民的民族民主革命运动。
    古巴法律工作者代表团团长圣地亚哥·古巴在宴会上讲话时强调说，决定力量强大的因素，绝不是武器，而最主要的是人。他说，美帝国主义如果侵略我们，古巴人民将坚决战斗到最后一滴血。
