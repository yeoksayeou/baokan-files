Xinhua News Agency, 9th November. The All-China Youth Federation today sent a telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, warmly congratulating the World Federation of Democratic Youth on its 15th anniversary.

The telegram said: "The establishment of the World Federation of Democratic Youth is of great significance. It reflects the demands of the world's broad youth, raises the banner of striving for world peace, national independence, democratic freedom, and a bright future for youth, converges the democratic youth movements of all countries in the world into a huge current, and has contributed to the development of the world's democratic youth movement.

"For fifteen years, the struggle of the world's people and youth against imperialism and in defense of world peace has risen greatly, severely hitting the war and aggression policies of imperialism headed by the United States. However, imperialism headed by the United States, with its inherent aggression, is unwilling to accept its defeat, frantically expands its arms and prepares for war, continues to pursue its war and aggression policies, bloodily suppresses the revolutionary struggles of various countries, and tries every possible means to corrupt and poison youth. The youth of the world increasingly realize that they must unite and wage unremitting struggles against imperialism headed by the United States in order to defend world peace and realize the beautiful ideals of youth. Opposing imperialism is the fundamental interest of youth and the sacred task of the world's democratic youth. In the common struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and in defense of world peace, the Chinese youth will always be the loyal friends of the youth of all countries who are fighting for peace, democracy, national liberation and social progress.

We believe that the World Federation of Democratic Youth will continue to hold high the banner of unity against imperialism, constantly encourage the youth of the world to unite, and strive to push the common cause of opposing imperialism and defending world peace to new victories."

    中华全国青年联合会电贺世界民主青年联盟成立十五周年
    新华社9日讯　中华全国青年联合会今天致电世界民主青年联盟，热烈祝贺世界民主青年联盟成立十五周年。
    电报说：“世界青联的成立具有重大的意义，它反映世界广大青年的要求，举起了争取世界和平、民族独立、民主自由和青年美好将来的旗帜，把全世界各国的民主青年运动汇合成一支巨流，并对世界民主青年运动的发展作出了贡献。
      “十五年以来，世界人民和青年反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的斗争有了巨大的高涨，沉重打击了以美国为首的帝国主义的战争和侵略政策。但是，侵略成性的以美国为首的帝国主义不甘心于自己的失败，疯狂地扩军备战，继续推行战争政策和侵略政策，血腥地镇压各国人民的革命斗争，千方百计地腐蚀和毒害青年。全世界青年越来越认识到必须团结起来，同以美国为首的帝国主义进行坚持不懈的斗争，才能保卫住世界和平，才能实现青年的美好的理想。反对帝国主义是青年的根本利益所在，是全世界民主青年的神圣任务。在全世界人民反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的共同斗争中，中国青年永远是一切为争取和平、民主、民族解放和社会进步而斗争的各国青年的忠实朋友。
    我们相信，世界青联将继续高举团结反帝的旗帜，不断鼓舞全世界青年团结起来，为把反对帝国主义和保卫世界和平的共同事业推向新的胜利而奋斗。”
