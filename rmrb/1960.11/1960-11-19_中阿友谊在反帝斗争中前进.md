    Sino-Arab Friendship Advances in the Anti-Imperialist Struggle
    Zhang Zongxun, Head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation Visiting the United Arab Republic
    At the invitation of Marshal Amir, Vice President and Minister of Defense of the United Arab Republic, the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation paid a friendly visit to the United Arab Republic from September 26 to October 23. During the twenty-eight-day visit, the delegation visited eleven provinces and cities, including Cairo, Damascus, Alexandria, Port Said, Ismailia, Suez, Aswan, and Luxor. They visited troops, military academies, factories, agricultural stations, universities, historical sites, and museums. They were warmly welcomed by the people and army of the UAR everywhere. During the visit, President Nasser and Vice President Amir received the delegation and had friendly talks. The delegation also had extensive friendly contacts with leaders of the UAR Army, Navy, Air Force, and various military regions, as well as government ministers and social celebrities. We conveyed the friendship of the Chinese people and army to the people and army of the UAR and brought back the friendship of the people and army of the UAR to the Chinese people and army. At the same time, we gained much useful knowledge from the current economic and national defense construction of the UAR and from the past brilliant culture of this ancient country. It can be said that this was a visit that enhanced the friendship between the people and armies of the two countries.
    This visit made us deeply feel that although China and the Arab countries are separated by thousands of miles, have different social systems, different customs and languages, the friendship between the people of the two countries not only has a long historical tradition, but also has been newly developed in the struggle against imperialist aggression, to defend national independence and to safeguard world peace after the two countries achieved their independence successively. During our visit, we felt the friendly feelings of the Arab people towards China everywhere. The delegation was warmly welcomed by the masses in Cairo, Damascus, Port Said, Fayoum and other places. Men touched their heads, touched their hearts, bowed, applauded; women shouted "Hululu" sounds, these are the traditional habits of the Arab nation, only when encountering great happy events and welcoming the most respected and closest guests. They said:
  "This is the Arab people's feelings for China." Especially when we visited Port Said, as soon as the delegation's motorcade drove into the city, people immediately shouted: "Sini, Sini, Sayida!" (Arabic: "China, China, good!") and rushed up to shake hands with us; when we laid a wreath at the Martyrs' Monument in Port Said, the masses automatically gathered around the square in front of the monument and applauded the delegation to pay their respects. Although our stay in Port Said was only a few short hours, the deep feelings of the people of this heroic city for New China left an unforgettable impression on the members of the delegation.
    The delegation also received grand receptions and warm welcomes when visiting the UAR troops and military academies. The Air Force Flying Academy gave a flight performance, and the Military Academy held a military parade. Both academies lined up and shouted at the end of the performance: "Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live! Long live!" Wherever the delegation went, people from all walks of life unanimously expressed their heartfelt gratitude to China for its support to the UAR during the Suez Canal incident and expressed their earnest hope for further developing friendly relations with China in the future. One government minister pointed out when talking about the relations between the two countries: "Colonial countries always try to create conspiracies in friendly country relations, what we hope is to overcome conspiracies and strengthen the relations between the two countries in all aspects." Throughout the visit, strengthening the friendship between China and Arab countries in the anti-imperialist struggle was always the theme of the talks between the hosts and guests. Major General Mukhosan, who accompanied us on the visit, once came to see us with his two sons. I said to these two Arab teenagers: "We saw during the visit that our ancestors in both countries had friendly exchanges thousands of years ago. After our two countries successively achieved independence, we further established mutual friendship in the anti-imperialist struggle. Our older generation are friends, and your next generation must also be friends. Imperialism is not reconciled to our independence. You must maintain and develop the friendship established by our ancestors and the older generation." These words touched their hearts, and everyone laughed happily. Through this visit lasting nearly a month, we firmly believe that the common historical experiences of the past and the common anti-imperialist tasks of today have linked the hearts of the Chinese and Arab people together. This friendship cannot be destroyed by imperialism. It will shine forever like the Great Wall and the Pyramids created by our ancestors and will flow endlessly like the Yangtze River and the Nile River.
    The people of the UAR are heroic and hardworking people. We saw that more than 96% of the land in the Egyptian region of the UAR is desert, with almost no rain all year round. For generations, the Egyptian people have struggled against nature under such conditions, reclaiming fertile land in the Nile Delta and oases in the desert, establishing irrigation systems, and producing world-renowned long-staple cotton and abundant grain. Due to geographical and climatic conditions, "water" has almost become synonymous with "life" in the Egyptian region of the UAR. At present, the UAR is still further improving water conservancy facilities, seizing water from "heaven" and land from the desert. We believe that the heroic and hardworking people of the UAR will surely achieve new victories in this regard.
    Both regions of the UAR were subjected to long-term colonial rule by imperialism in the past, and the industrial base was extremely weak. However, after the UAR won independence, it has achieved noteworthy results in economic development. We saw during the visit that the Helwan area, which used to be a desert, has now established and is continuing to build new factories. Despite the difficulties in raw materials and technology, the UAR, which originally did not produce a ton of steel, has already sprayed molten steel in its own open-hearth furnaces. Moreover, the textile, petroleum, fertilizer, electricity, and national defense industries have also made new developments. The development of the UAR's industry is what imperialism is most unhappy about, but it plays a positive role in the UAR's cause of safeguarding national independence.
    During this visit, we also saw the efforts made by the UAR in building up its armed forces to defend its motherland. What we were particularly interested in was that they paid attention to the characteristics of the desert area, trained soldiers to adapt to the hot climate and desert environment, and conducted long-distance running or exercises in the scorching sun. All military academies and training centers have good sports equipment and pay great attention to physical training. In tactical and technical education, attention is paid to the use of sand tables, models, slides and other visual education. The performances they gave to the delegation showed good skills. We believe that in the struggle against imperialist aggression and to defend their motherland's independence, the UAR army will show its strength.
    Both regions of the UAR have a long ancient culture and a glorious history. During the visit, the pyramids near Cairo, the Karnak Temple and the Valley of the Kings in Luxor, the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, and other magnificent buildings from more than a thousand to five thousand years ago deeply aroused our admiration for the diligence and wisdom of the ancient Egyptian and Arab peoples. In particular, we also saw beautiful and healthy Arab national dances at the welcome banquet at the Azm Palace in Damascus, at the dance performance at the Cairo Higher Women's Sports Academy, and at the grand celebration of the UAR Army Day. We also saw a film called "the Romeo and Juliet of Arabia", which is a colorful film "Qays and Layla" with national characteristics based on Egyptian folk legends. We believe that the people of the UAR, who created the splendid ancient Arab culture, will surely achieve new achievements in resisting imperialist cultural aggression and developing their own national culture.
    During the short visit of less than a month, although it was impossible for us to conduct a comprehensive and detailed investigation of the efforts of our UAR friends in building and defending their motherland, the enthusiasm and desire of the vast number of UAR people and even people from all walks of life to enhance the friendly relations between China and Arab countries, the diligence and bravery of the UAR people, and the efforts of the UAR army to continuously strengthen its combat effectiveness in order to defend national independence have left a deep impression on us. The friendship between China and Arab countries is based on the common anti-imperialist struggle, the spirit of the Bandung Conference, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In today's continuing vigorous development of the anti-imperialist struggle, the further development of Sino-Arab friendship will surely make new contributions to stopping imperialist aggression and safeguarding world peace.

    中阿友谊在反帝斗争中前进
    中国访问阿联军事友好代表团团长　张宗逊
    中国军事友好代表团，应阿拉伯联合共和国副总统兼国防部长阿密尔元帅的邀请，于9月26日至10月23日在阿拉伯联合共和国进行了友好访问。在历时二十八天的访问中，代表团先后到了开罗、大马士革、亚历山大、塞得港、伊士美利亚、苏伊士、阿斯旺、路克苏尔等十一个省市，参观访问了部队、军事院校、工厂、农业站、高等院校以及名胜古迹、博物馆等，到处受到了阿联人民和军队的热烈欢迎。在访问期间，纳赛尔总统和阿密尔副总统分别接见了代表团并进行了友好的交谈。代表团还和阿联陆、海、空军和各军区的领导人，以及政府部长和社会名流进行了广泛的友好接触。我们向阿联朋友们传达了中国人民和军队对阿联人民和军队的友谊，也带回了阿联人民和军队对中国人民和军队的友谊，同时也从阿联当前的经济建设和国防建设中，从这个古老国家过去灿烂的文化中，得到了许多有益的知识。可以说：这是一次增进两国人民和军队之间友谊的访问。
    这次访问，使我们深深感到中阿两国虽然远隔万里，有着不同的社会制度，不同的风俗习惯和语言，然而两国人民之间的友谊，不仅有着悠久的历史传统，而且在两国先后取得自己的独立以后，又在反对帝国主义侵略、保卫民族独立和维护世界和平的斗争中，得到了新的发展。我们在访问期间，到处都感受到了阿联人民对中国的友好感情。代表团在开罗、大马士革、塞得港、法尤姆等地都受到了群众的热烈欢迎。男人们以手摸顶、扪心、鞠躬、鼓掌；妇女们喊出“呼噜噜”的声音，这些都是阿拉伯民族的传统习惯，只有在遇到大喜事和欢迎最尊敬最亲密的客人时才这样。他们说：
  “这就是阿拉伯人民对中国的感情”。特别是我们访问塞得港时，代表团车队刚一开进这个城市，人们立即喊着：“悉尼，悉尼，赛伊达！”（阿拉伯语：“中国，中国，好！”）纷纷赶上来同我们握手；当我们向塞得港烈士纪念碑献花圈时，群众又自动围拢在碑前广场的两旁，向代表团鼓掌致敬。我们在塞得港逗留的时间虽然只有短短的几小时，但是这个英雄城市的人民对新中国的深厚感情，却给代表团的成员们留下了难忘的印象。
    代表团在参观阿联部队和军事院校时，也都受到了隆重的接待和热烈的欢迎。空军飞行学院作了飞行表演，军事学院举行了阅兵式，这两个学院都在表演结束时列队高呼：“中华人民共和国万岁！万岁！万岁！”代表团所到之处，所接触到的各阶层人士，都不约而同地对中国在苏伊士事件中对阿联人民的支援表示衷心的感谢，对今后进一步发展同中国的友好关系，表示殷切的愿望。有一位政府部长在谈到两国关系时指出：“殖民国家在友好国家关系中总是企图制造阴谋，我们所希望的就是克服阴谋，加强两国各方面的关系。”在整个访问过程中，加强中阿两国在反帝斗争中的友谊始终是宾主双方谈话的主题。陪同我们参观的穆霍森少将，有一次带着他的两个儿子来看望我们，我对这两位阿拉伯少年说：“我们在参观中看到，我们两国的祖先在几千年前就有着友好的往来，在我们两国先后取得独立之后，我们又在反帝斗争中进一步建立了相互之间的友谊，我们老一辈人是朋友，你们下一代也要做朋友，帝国主义对我们的独立是不甘心的，你们一定要把祖先和老一辈建立起来的友谊保持和发展下去。”这些话说到了他们心里，大家都高兴地笑了起来。通过这次历时近一个月的访问，我们深信，过去共同的历史遭遇和今天共同的反帝任务，把中、阿两国人民的心连结了起来，这种友谊是帝国主义所破坏不了的，它将像我们祖先所创造的长城和金字塔一样永放光芒，将像长江与尼罗河一样长流不息。
    阿联人民是英勇而勤劳的人民。我们看到，阿联的埃及地区96％以上的土地是沙漠，几乎终年不落雨。埃及人民世世代代就是在这样的条件下同自然斗争，在尼罗河三角洲和沙漠中的绿洲上开垦出肥沃的土地，建立起灌溉系统，生产出世界驰名的长绒棉和丰盛的粮食。由于地理和气候条件，使得“水”在阿联的埃及地区几乎成了“生命”的同义语。目前，阿联还正在进一步改善水利设施，向“老天”夺水，向沙漠争地。我们相信，英勇勤劳的阿联人民，在这方面一定会取得新的胜利。
    阿联的两个地区，过去都受过帝国主义长期的殖民统治，工业基础极其薄弱，但是，阿联争得独立以后，在发展经济方面，已经获得了值得重视的成果。我们在参观中看到，原来一片荒漠的赫尔万区，现在已经建立起了和还在继续建设着新的工厂。尽管存在着原料和技术上的困难，但是，原来不出一吨钢的阿联已经在自己的平炉里喷吐出钢水来了，而且，纺织、石油、化肥、电力以及国防工业，也都有了新的发展。阿联工业的发展，是帝国主义最不高兴的，而对阿联维护民族独立的事业却起着积极作用。
    在这次访问中，我们也看到了阿联在保卫自己祖国的武装力量建设上所作的努力。使我们特别感到有兴趣的是，他们注意到沙漠地区的特点，锻炼士兵适应酷热气候和沙漠环境，在炽热的阳光下，进行长跑或操练，各军事院校和训练中心，都有良好的体育设备，很注意体格的训练。在战术技术教育中，则注意采用沙盘、模型、幻灯等形象化的教育。他们为代表团所做的表演中，都表现了良好的技术。我们相信，在反对帝国主义侵略、保卫自己祖国独立的斗争中，阿联军队将会显示出自己的力量。
    阿联的两个地区都有着悠久的古代文化和光荣的历史。在参观中，开罗附近的金字塔，路克苏尔的卡那尔神庙和帝王之谷，大马士革的奥玛雅清真寺等，这些一千多年至五千年以前的雄伟建筑，深深引起了我们对古埃及人民和阿拉伯人民勤劳与智慧的钦佩。特别是我们还先后在大马士革阿兹姆宫的欢迎晚会上，在开罗高等女子体育学院的舞蹈表演中，在阿联陆军节的盛大庆祝会上，都看到了优美而健康的阿拉伯民族舞蹈。我们还看到了被称作为“阿拉伯的梁山伯与祝英台”的影片，这是一部富有民族色彩的取材于埃及民间传说的彩色影片“盖伊斯与莱伊莱”。我们相信，创造了灿烂的古阿拉伯文化的阿联人民，在抵制帝国主义的文化侵略、发展自己的民族文化方面，是一定能取得新的成就的。
    在为时不足一月的短短访问中，我们虽然不可能对阿联朋友建设和保卫自己祖国的努力，作全面的详细考察，然而阿联广大人民以至各阶层人士，对增进中阿两国友好关系的热情和愿望，阿联人民的勤劳和勇敢，阿联军队为保卫民族独立不断加强自己战斗力的努力，都给我们留下了深刻的印象。中阿两国的友谊是建立在共同进行反帝斗争、万隆会议精神和五项原则的基础之上的，在反帝斗争继续蓬勃发展的今天，中阿友谊的进一步发展，必将对制止帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平作出新的贡献。（附图片）
