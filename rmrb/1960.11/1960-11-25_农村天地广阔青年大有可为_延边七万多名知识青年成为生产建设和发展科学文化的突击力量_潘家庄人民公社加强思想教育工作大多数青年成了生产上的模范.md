Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 24th: In recent years, 72,000 educated youths in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, have returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. Through practical training in productive labor, they have become a shock force in rural production and construction and the development of scientific and cultural undertakings.

Since 1953, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has seen over ten thousand educated youths return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production each year. Currently, educated youths participating in agricultural production account for approximately 30% of the total rural labor force, reaching over 85% of all rural youths in the prefecture. Some of these are high school and university graduates. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, they have actively and voluntarily participated in some of the more arduous production tasks in the countryside. During this year's rice transplanting season, the youths formed over 3,900 shock teams and launched a red flag competition for transplanting experts. As a result, over 530 red flag shock teams and 8,300 transplanting experts who could transplant over two mu per day were identified, winning praise from their fellow villagers. Under the leadership of the commune's Party committee, 135 educated youths from the Chongshan People's Commune in Helong County formed a youth shock team and, after two years of hard work, built an 18-li-long canal that irrigated 6,450 mu of paddy fields, transforming the area from a drought- and flood-prone region with frequent crop failures into a land of abundant rice harvests year after year. These returning educated youths are also a vital force in disseminating scientific and cultural knowledge in the countryside. They conduct scientific research activities based on the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" and using high-yield fields and experimental plots as their base. Party and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels in the prefecture attach great importance to the youths' scientific research activities. In addition to providing the necessary experimental plots and instruments, they also help them form over 3,000 research and experimental teams and groups, and regularly hold "three-way combination research meetings of cadres, experienced farmers, and youths" and "science and technology lectures" for them. Yanji County alone has 645 scientific experimental groups, mainly composed of youths and including experienced farmers and technicians, with the participation of over 8,600 youths, accounting for 72% of the county's total number of youths. Currently, over 8,000 rural educated youths in the prefecture have become technicians, researchers, and agronomists. Liu Changyin, a youth seed breeder from the Bao'an People's Commune in Antu County, has cultivated a high-yield rice variety suitable for high-altitude areas called "Wanbao No. 8," with each ear bearing around 300 grains. Over 10,000 educated youths across the prefecture have also served as amateur farmer teachers, helping the broad masses of commune members learn culture.

Through training in agricultural production and cultivation by Party and Communist Youth League organizations, these rural educated youths have continuously improved their socialist consciousness and greatly strengthened their class perspective. Since 1958 alone, over 2,200 rural educated youths in the prefecture have honorably joined the Communist Party of China, over 22,000 educated youths have joined the Communist Youth League, and over 15,000 youths have been selected as red banner pacesetters.

Xinhua News Agency reports: The Party organization of the Panjiazhuang People's Commune in Xingren County, Guizhou Province, emphasizes educating young people to love the countryside and agricultural labor, making over 5,000 young people in the commune the backbone of agricultural production and various construction endeavors.

The Party committee of the Panjiazhuang Commune and the Party general branches of the management districts, down to the Party branches of the production teams, put forward specific requirements for doing a good job in the ideological education of young people when arranging each task; when checking and comparing work, the ideological education of young people is also checked and compared at the same time. Under the specific guidance of the Party organization, the commune's Communist Youth League organizations at all levels also regard educating young people to love agricultural labor as their most important task. They once mobilized the youths of the entire commune to conduct long-term study and discussion on issues such as "how to become red in the countryside and expert in the countryside." Combining special discussions, the commune's Communist Youth League committee also organized the youths of the entire commune to study the advanced deeds of national famous youth socialist construction activists Xu Jianchun, Huang Baolan, and An Chengxiang, who regarded the commune as their home, loved the countryside, and loved agricultural labor. At the same time, the Party and Communist Youth League organizations promptly praised and rewarded advanced figures who emerged in various tasks in the commune, set up role models, and organized the youths of the entire commune to learn from them. In production, the Party organizations at all levels in the commune also provided various conditions and fully brought their role into play according to the characteristics of young people, so that young people could see that they had a lot to offer and a bright future in the countryside. For example, under the encouragement and specific guidance of the Party organization, the young men and women of each production team in the commune, in addition to actively participating in regular agricultural labor, also engaged in a wide variety of scientific experiments. New agricultural production technologies such as the wheat strip sowing dense planting method, rice double-plant dense planting, and corn artificial pollination in the commune were first successfully tested by young people and then promoted throughout the commune, which played a great role in increasing grain production throughout the commune.

Under the education of the Party, the production technology and political awareness of the youths have been continuously improved. Since this year, more than 60% of the youths in the commune have become labor models, production pacesetters, and five-good commune members of the commune and production teams. Two hundred and sixteen members of the Communist Youth League have honorably joined the Communist Party of China, and two hundred and seventy-eight young people have joined the Communist Youth League.

    新华社长春24日电　吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州几年来陆续回乡参加农业生产的七万二千名知识青年，通过生产劳动的实际锻炼，已经成为农村的生产建设和发展科学文化事业中一支突击力量。
    延边朝鲜族自治州自1953年以来，每年都有上万名知识青年回乡参加农业生产。现在，全州参加农业生产的知识青年已占全部农村劳动力的30％左右，达全州农村青年的85％以上。其中有一部分是高中和大学的毕业生。几年来，他们在党的领导下，积极主动地参加农村中一些较艰苦的生产任务。今年的插秧季节里，青年们组成三千九百多个突击队，开展了插秧能手红旗竞赛，结果提出了五百三十多个红旗突击队和八千三百名日插二亩以上的插秧能手，博得了乡亲们的赞扬。和龙县崇善人民公社的一百三十五名知识青年，在公社党委领导下，组成青年突击队，经过两年奋战，修成一条长达十八华里的水渠，灌溉了六千四百五十亩水田，使那里由旱涝成灾、十年九不收地方变成了连年丰收的米粮川。这些回乡的知识青年还是农村中传播科学文化知识的生力军。他们以农业“八字宪法”为内容，以丰产田、试验田为阵地开展科学研究活动。全州各级党、团组织，对青年们的科学研究活动极为重视，除给予必要的试验田和仪器外，并帮助他们组成三千多个研究试验队和小组，经常为他们举行“干部、老农、青年三结合研究会”、“科学技术讲座”等。延吉县就有六百四十五个以青年为主，有老农、技术员参加的各种科学试验小组，参加的青年达八千六百多人，占全县青年总数的72％。现在，全州已有八千多名农村知识青年成为技术员、研究员和农学家。安图县保安人民公社青年育种员柳昌银已经培育出一种适合高山地区的高产水稻品种“万宝八号”，每穗结三百粒左右。全州还有一万多名知识青年担任了业余农民教员，帮助广大社员学习文化。
    这些农村知识青年经过农业生产的锻炼和党、团组织的培养，社会主义觉悟不断提高，阶级观点大大增强。全州仅1958年以来就有二千二百多名农村知识青年光荣地参加了中国共产党，二万二千多名知识青年参加了共青团，一万五千多名青年被选为红旗手。
    据新华社讯　贵州省兴仁县潘家庄人民公社党组织重视对青年进行热爱农村、热爱农业劳动的教育，使全社五千多名青年，成为农业生产和各项建设事业的中坚力量。
    潘家庄公社党委和各管理区党总支，一直到生产队的党支部，在布置每项工作时，都对作好青年的思想教育工作提出具体要求；检查评比工作时，也对青年思想教育工作同时进行检查评比。在党组织的具体指导下，公社的各级团组织，也都把教育青年热爱农业劳动当作自己最重要的任务。它们曾发动全社青年就“如何红在农村，专在农村”等问题，进行了长时期的学习和讨论，结合专题讨论，公社团委还组织全社青年学习了全国著名的青年社会主义建设积极分子徐建春、黄宝兰、安成香等以社为家、热爱农村、热爱农业劳动的先进事迹。同时，党、团组织对本社各项工作中涌现的先进人物及时予以表扬、奖励，树立标兵，组织全社青年向他们学习。在生产中，公社各级党组织还根据青年的特点，提供各种条件，充分发挥他们的作用，使青年们看到自己在农村大有可为和远大前途。例如，在党组织的鼓励和具体指导下，公社各生产队的男女青年们，除了积极参加经常性的农业劳动外，还搞起了丰富多采的科学试验。全社的小麦条播密植法、水稻双株密植和苞谷人工授粉等新的农业生产技术，都是由青年们首先试验成功，然后在全社推广的，对全社粮食增产起了很大作用。
    在党的教育下，青年们的生产技术和政治觉悟都不断提高，今年以来，全社有60％以上的青年成为公社和生产队的劳动模范、生产标兵和五好社员。有二百一十六名共青团员光荣地参加了中国共产党，二百七十八名青年参加了共青团。
