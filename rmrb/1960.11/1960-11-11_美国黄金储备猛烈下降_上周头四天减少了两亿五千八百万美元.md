Xinhua News Agency, 9th November: According to Western news agencies, the decrease in U.S. gold reserves reached a record figure last week (the week ending November 5th). News revealed on the 8th indicated that on November 3rd alone, the United States lost $175 million in gold reserves, the largest single-day decline since the capitalist world economic crisis of 1931.

Adding to the amounts lost in the three days from October 31st to November 2nd, U.S. gold reserves decreased by $258 million in the first four days of last week alone, leaving only $18,159 million by November 3rd. It is estimated that this figure is already one or two hundred million dollars less than the short-term debts owed by American banks to foreigners, not even including the short-term dollar debts held by the International Monetary Fund and dollars held by foreigners.

The British "Financial Times" published an article on the 8th stating that U.S. gold reserves are reaching a dangerous point, and the next month or two will be a difficult period for the dollar. The newspaper said, "Unless there is an immediate turnaround, U.S. (gold) reserves will soon fall below $18 billion." The "Financial Times" pointed out that $18 billion in gold reserves "is considered a particularly significant figure in the (U.S.) struggle to maintain the current exchange rate between the dollar and gold."

Panic-stricken U.S. authorities are now frantically trying to slightly mitigate the current trend of rapid gold outflow. Because they are unwilling to reduce war preparations and economic expansion, they are not reducing the huge overseas military expenditures, the so-called "foreign aid" expenses, and overseas investments that are the main factors contributing to the huge deficit in the U.S. balance of international payments and the outflow of gold, but instead, they are focusing on minor details. For example, U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury Allen recently convened representatives from American businesses, labor unions, and marine insurance companies, asking them to transport goods on American ships as much as possible to prevent freight costs in dollars from falling into the hands of other countries. For the same purpose, the U.S. government is considering prohibiting U.S. military personnel stationed abroad from bringing their families. Some even advocate that the government launch a campaign to attract foreigners to travel to the United States in order to obtain the foreign exchange spent by these people in the United States.

### 美国黄金储备猛烈下降  上周头四天减少了两亿五千八百万美元

    美国黄金储备猛烈下降
    上周头四天减少了两亿五千八百万美元
    新华社9日讯　据西方通讯社报道，上星期（到11月5日为止的一周）中，美国黄金储备的减少达到了破纪录的数字。据8日透露出来的消息，在11月3日这一天，美国就丧失了价值一亿七千五百万美元的黄金储备，这是1931年资本主义世界经济大危机以来一天中减少得最多的数字。
    再加上从10月31日到11月2日三天中减少的数目，上星期单是头四天美国黄金储备就减少了两亿五千八百万美元，到11月3日已只剩下一百八十一亿五千九百万美元了。据估计，这个数字已经比美国银行欠外国人的短期债务还要少一两亿美元，还没有把国际货币基金组织所拥有短期美元债务和外国拥有的美元计算在内。
    英国“金融时报”8日发表文章说，美国黄金储备正在达到危险点，下一两个月将是美元的难关。报纸说，“除非立刻有一个向后转，美国（黄金）储备很快要降到一百八十亿美元以下”。“金融时报”指出，一百八十亿美元的黄金储备“被认为是（美国）在维持美元对黄金的目前的比价的挣扎中的有特别意义的数字”。
    惊惶的美国当局现在手忙脚乱地设法稍稍缓和目前黄金猛烈外流的趋势。由于它不肯放松战争准备和经济扩张，它不去减缩成为美国国际收支巨大赤字和黄金外流的主要因素的庞大的海外军费支出、所谓“援外”费用和海外投资，却在枝节上打主意。例如，美国财政部副部长艾伦最近召集了美国的企业、工会和海上保险业的代表开会，要求他们尽可能地把货物交给美国船只运输，以免运费这笔美元落入其他国家手中。为了同一目的，美国政府正在考虑要禁止美国驻在外国的军人带家属。有人甚至主张要政府发动拉外国人到美国来旅行的运动，以便取得这批人在美国花费的外汇。（附图片）
