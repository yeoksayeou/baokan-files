    Why Sweet Potato Vines Can Be Used for Propagation
    Zhejiang Agricultural University Crop Teaching and Research Group
    Editor's Note: In order to save sweet potato seed tubers, many regions have adopted the method of using retained vines for propagation this year. This newspaper has already introduced the effect and simple methods of using retained sweet potato vines for propagation. Today's article focuses on explaining why sweet potatoes can be propagated using retained vines.
    Using sweet potato vines for propagation is a good way to save seed tubers and food. Using potato vines for propagation can allow for earlier cuttings, and has the advantages of early budding, fast growth, early tuber formation, and high yield. In addition, it can also reduce the harm of black spot disease.
    The method of using potato vines instead of potato seeds to cultivate sweet potatoes was recorded in Xu Guangqi's "Complete Treatise on Agriculture," written in the Ming Dynasty, indicating that Chinese laborers were already using this method to plant sweet potatoes at that time. Currently, the application of this method is relatively common in provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian, and individual places in the Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Ningbo regions of Zhejiang Province have also accumulated a lot of experience.

        Why Can Potato Vines Still Grow
          and Form Tubers After Winter Storage?
    Why can sweet potato vines still sprout, grow vines, and form tubers in the second year after winter storage? This is determined by the growth characteristics of sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes can be planted in all seasons in tropical and subtropical regions, and are perennial crops, so they have the characteristics of perennial crops. Their life cycle is much longer than that of annual crops. When winter comes and the tubers stop developing and can be harvested, the potato vines do not die immediately. As long as they are stored well, they can still maintain relatively strong vitality. Secondly, sweet potatoes are crops that are propagated vegetatively for a long time, so they have a series of adaptations to vegetative propagation. This is mainly reflected in the strong regeneration ability of the stems. There are dormant buds on its stem nodes, which can use the nutrients stored in the stems and leaves to grow into new individuals as long as there is a suitable environment; at the same time, there are also differentiated latent root primordia on the stem nodes. These root primordia can quickly grow into young roots under high temperature and humidity, and perform the function of absorbing and storing nutrients. In addition, rich nutrients are stored in the sweet potato stems. In addition to the part consumed by respiration due to life activities during storage, the rest is enough to supply the growth of young buds and young roots. After the young roots grow out, as long as the management is timely and the conditions are suitable, they can generally grow into tubers well. Because sweet potatoes have these characteristics, high yields can also be obtained by using potato vines for propagation.
              How to Store Potato Vines for Propagation
    To use potato vines for propagation, it is necessary to master two important links: storing potato vines well and cultivating strong seedlings well.
    To store potato vines, first dig a cellar. The cellar should be selected on a high mound where the soil is firm, sheltered from the wind and facing the sun, well-drained, and has a low water table. In mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, hillsides and high embankments can be used, and dug in from the side like a stove hole. The cellar opening should be small. Potato vines must be harvested in advance before heavy frost, and attention should be paid to selecting the middle and upper parts of the potato vines that are green, sound, strong, and free from disease, and have the characteristics of the variety. The vines at the top contain too much water, and the vines at the base have too much fiber and aged tissue, and contain less nutrients, resulting in slow and thin seedlings, which are not suitable for propagation. After the potato vines are put into the cellar, seal the cellar door. After five to seven days, when the leaves have withered and yellowed, open the cellar door, shake off the withered leaves, pick off the green parts at the top, sweep out the fallen leaves in the cellar, and then put them back into the cellar in the same way, and then seal the cellar door. In order to control temperature and humidity, a vent hole can be left in the cellar opening for adjustment.
    From the Awakening of Insects to the Spring Equinox, take out the potato vines stored before the year from the cellar (at this time, thin roots one to two inches long have grown on the vine nodes), and select the middle vines for raising seedlings. The seedbed should be selected in a place that is sheltered from the wind and facing the sun, with high and dry terrain and good drainage. The method of making the seedbed is the same as the seedbed for raising seedlings using seed potatoes, except that after covering the heating material with fertile soil, the potato vines cannot be directly placed. A thin layer of rice straw needs to be laid on the fertile soil, and then the potato vines are placed, covered with a thin layer of rice straw, and then covered with about half an inch of fertile soil to prevent the soil from directly contacting the potato vines and causing rot. When the seedlings emerge from the soil, fertilization and soil cultivation and other seedling management can be carried out.

    为什么甘薯留藤可以做种
    浙江农业大学作物教研组
    编者按：为了节约甘薯种薯，今年许多地区采用了留藤做种的办法。关于甘薯留藤做种的效果、简单办法，本报已经有过介绍，今天发表的这篇文章，着重说明为什么甘薯能留藤作种。
    用番薯（甘薯）藤留种是节约种薯、节省粮食的好方法。用薯藤留种，能提早扦插，并具有出芽早、生长快、结薯早、产量高等优点。此外，还可以减轻黑斑病的危害。
    用薯藤代替薯种培育番薯的方法，早在明朝徐光启著的“农政全书”上已有记载，可见当时我国劳动人民已在应用这种方法种植番薯。目前，广东、福建等省应用此法种植番薯比较普遍，浙江省的温州、金华、宁波等专区的个别地方也累积了不少经验。
        为什么薯藤经过冬藏
          第二年仍能生长结薯
    为什么番薯藤经过冬季贮藏而在第二年仍然能够出芽、长藤、结薯呢？这是由番薯的生育特性决定的。番薯在热带和亚热带地区可以四季种植，是多年生的作物，因此它就具有多年生作物的特性。它的生命周期比一年生作物要长得多。当入冬以后，薯块停止发育可以收获时，薯藤并没有立刻死亡，只要贮藏得好，仍然能保持比较强盛的生命力。其次，番薯是长期用营养体繁殖的作物，所以它具有一系列营养体繁殖的适应性。这主要表现在茎的再生能力很强，在它的茎节上有潜伏芽，只要有合适的环境，就能利用茎叶中贮藏的养分长成新的个体；同时在茎节上还具有已经分化的潜伏的根原基，这种根原基在较高的温度和湿度下，能很快长成幼根，执行吸收和贮藏养分的功能。此外，在番薯茎中贮藏着丰富的养分。这些养分，除在贮藏过程中因生命活动进行呼吸作用而消耗一部分以外，其余的足够供给幼芽和幼根生出之用，当幼根长出以后，只要管理及时，条件适宜，一般都能很好长成薯块。由于番薯有这些特性，所以应用薯藤留种也同样可以获得高产。
              怎样贮藏做种的薯藤
    采用薯藤留种必须掌握贮好薯藤和育好壮苗两个重要环节。
    贮藏薯藤首先要挖好地窖。地窖宜选择在土壤紧实、避风向阳、排水良好、地下水位低的高墩处，在山区和半山区可以利用山坡和高墈，从侧面如灶孔一样挖入。窖口宜小。薯藤必须在浓霜前提前收获，并注意要选择色泽青绿、健全粗壮、没有病害，具有本品种特性的中部和中上部薯藤最好。梢部的薯藤含水分太多，基部的藤纤维质太多，组织老化，含养分少，出苗慢而瘦小，都不适用留种。薯藤放入窖里以后，将窖门封闭，过五至七天，叶片已枯黄，可打开窖门，抖落枯叶，摘去顶端青绿部分，扫出窖内落叶，再依前法放入窖内，然后封闭窖门。为了控制温度与湿度，在窖口可留一通气孔，以便调节。
    在惊蛰至春分时，把年前贮藏的薯藤从窖内取出（此时藤节上已长出一至二寸长的细根），选取中部藤蔓用来育苗。苗床要选择避风向阳、地势高燥、排水良好的地方，苗床的制作方法与应用种薯育苗的苗床相同，只是在酿热物上复盖肥土后，不能直接排放薯藤，需要在肥土上铺上一层薄薄的稻草，再排放薯藤，藤上铺一层薄稻草，然后再盖肥土半寸左右，防止泥土与薯藤直接接触引起腐烂。在薯苗露出土时，即可进行施肥培土等苗期管理。
