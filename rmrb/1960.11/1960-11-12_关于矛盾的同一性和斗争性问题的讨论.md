A discussion has been underway among some philosophy workers recently on the questions of whether there is identity between erroneous thinking and existence, the relationship between identity and struggle, whether there is identity in states of qualitative change, and the motive force of things' development. These questions all relate to the understanding of the core of dialectics, namely the law of the unity of opposites, and have therefore attracted people's attention.

The discussion on the identity and struggle of contradictions was triggered by an article by Comrade Xue Jing. Xue Jing's article "The Relationship Between Unity and Struggle" was published in the sixth issue of "New Construction" this year, followed by the publication of Yan Li's dissenting views in the seventh issue (reported in this newspaper). Subsequently, discussion articles by Zhou Shuwen, Wu Bingyuan, Tang Kailin, Ke Ji, and others were published in "Guangming Daily," "Academic Monthly," and "Wenhui Daily." The discussion is now in its initial stage.

Xue Jing's main arguments are: (1) "The unity and struggle of opposites refer to the two kinds of properties or two kinds of relationships that opposites possess. These two kinds of properties or two kinds of relationships also constitute opposites, that is, there is also the nature or relationship of the unity of opposites between them." (2) "From the aspect that struggle cannot be separated from unity, struggle is also relative." (3) "Unity only exists conditionally in the process of quantitative change, but does not exist in the process of qualitative change, while struggle exists unconditionally throughout the entire process of things."

In defending his arguments, Xue Jing cited Engels' discussion of the relative significance of opposites as the basis for "struggle is also relative." He refuted Yan Li's criticism, saying that since Comrade Yan Li admits that "any opposition (contradiction) is relative," then he cannot deny that struggle also has relativity. He said that denying the relativity of opposition, like denying the relativity of unity, is a metaphysical viewpoint. Regarding the point he himself had put forward, "the unity of opposites only exists conditionally and relatively in the quantitative change stage of the development process," he gave this explanation: "This unity refers to the state of unity, and saying that unity does not exist in the process of qualitative change refers to the destruction of the state of unity, the decomposition of the unified body."

Zhou Shuwen, in response to Xue Jing's arguments, put forward different opinions. He said that one of the meanings of identity is mutual transformation, so it can be seen that identity still exists in the state of qualitative change, but in the quantitative change stage of things, the identity of contradictions is mainly manifested as mutual dependence, coexisting in a unified body, while in the qualitative change stage, the identity of contradictions is mainly manifested as the mutual penetration and mutual transformation of opposing sides. He also disagreed with the statement that identity and struggle "mutually influence" and "mutually form the basis" for each other.

Wu Bingyuan said: The view that identity and struggle both have relativity, and that the status of the two is only half a catty to eight taels, does not conform to the dialectical law of objective things. Xue Jing's view that the identity of contradictions excludes the absolute development of struggle is incorrect. In fact, what hinders the development of things is not identity itself, but the old forces in the opposing sides of the contradiction.

Tang Kailin wrote that Xue Jing, on the one hand, admits that struggle exists within unity, and that there is no struggle without unity, but on the other hand, he believes that unity only exists in the process of quantitative change, while struggle exists throughout the process of things, which is self-contradictory. He believes that qualitative change is the decomposition of the identity of contradictions in things, but the decomposition of the identity of contradictions in things cannot be completed all at once, but requires a process. Only when the identity of contradictions in things is completely decomposed, then the process of qualitative change of things is finally completed, and the new things completely replace the old things. Therefore, even the struggle of contradictions in the process of qualitative change must exist within the identity of contradictions, "but this kind of identity is definitely not like the identity of contradictions in a relatively stable state in the process of quantitative change, but a kind of identity that is being rapidly destroyed by the struggle of contradictions."

Ke Ji also disagreed with Xue Jing's views. He put forward this view: regarding the question of whether there is identity of contradictions in the state of qualitative change of things, simply answering "yes" or "no" is incorrect and a metaphysical one-sidedness. Lenin believed that the difference between dialectical transformation and non-dialectical transformation "lies in the leap, in the contradictoriness, in the interruption of the gradual process, in the unity (identity) of being and non-being." Based on this, Ke Ji believes that the identity in the state of qualitative change both exists and does not exist, so it is the unity of existence and non-existence.

### 关于矛盾的同一性和斗争性问题的讨论

    关于矛盾的同一性和斗争性问题的讨论
    最近一个时期，一些哲学工作者就错误思维和存在有没有同一性的问题、同一性和斗争性的关系以及质变状态有没有同一性的问题、事物发展的动力问题进行了讨论。这些问题都涉及到对辩证法的核心即对立统一规律的认识，因此引起了人们的注意。
    矛盾的同一性和斗争性问题讨论是由薛靖同志的文章引起的。《新建设》今年第六期上发表了薛靖的《统一性和斗争性的关系》一文，随后在第七期上又发表了言立的不同意见（本报已作报道）。以后，《光明日报》《学术月刊》《文汇报》上又发表了周书文、吴秉元、唐凯麟、砢几等人的讨论文章。现在这个讨论已初步展开。
    薛靖的主要论点是：（1）“对立面的统一和斗争是指对立面所具有的两种性质或两种关系。这两种性质或两种关系也构成了对立面，即它们之间也有对立统一的性质或关系。”（2）“从斗争性不能离开统一性这一方面说，斗争性也是相对的。”（3）“统一性只是有条件地存在于量变过程中，而不存在于质变过程中，而斗争性则无条件地存在于事物过程的始终。”
    在为自己的论点进行答辩时，薛靖引证了恩格斯的关于对立具有相对意义的论述，作为“斗争性也是相对的”的论据。他反驳言立的批评说，既然言立同志承认“任何对立（矛盾）都是相对的”，那么就不能否认斗争也具有相对性。他说，否认对立的相对性，同否认统一的相对性一样，都是形而上学的观点。关于他自己曾提出的“对立面的统一只是有条件地相对地存在于发展过程的量变阶段”这个论点，他作了这样的解释：“这个统一是指统一状态，说质变过程中统一不存在，是指统一状态的破坏，统一体的分解。”
    周书文针对薛靖的论点，提出了不同意见。他说，同一性的含义之一就是互相转化，可见在质变状态中同一性还是存在的，只不过在事物的量变阶段，矛盾的同一性主要表现为互相依存，共处于统一体中，而在质变阶段，矛盾的同一性则主要表现为对立双方的互相贯通，互相转化。他也不同意同一性和斗争性是“互为影响”，“互为基础”的说法。
    吴秉元说：认为同一性和斗争性都有相对性，它们两者的地位不过是半斤八两，这种论点不符合客观事物的辩证规律。薛靖认为矛盾的同一性排斥斗争性的绝对发展，这是不对的，实际上阻碍事物发展的不是同一性本身，而是矛盾对立面中旧势力的一方。
    唐凯麟写道，薛靖一方面承认斗争性存在于统一性之中，离开了统一性就没有斗争性，但是另一方面又认为统一性只存在于量变过程中，而斗争性则存在于事物过程的始终，这是自相矛盾的。他认为，质变是事物矛盾同一性的分解，但是事物矛盾的同一性的分解不是一下子就能完成，而需要一个过程。只有当事物矛盾的同一性完全分解了，那时事物的质变过程才最终完成，新事物才完全代替旧事物。因此，即使是质变过程中矛盾的斗争也必须存在于矛盾的同一性之中，“但是这种同一性决不是像量变过程中处于相对稳定状态的矛盾的同一性，而是一种为矛盾斗争迅速破坏中的同一性。”
    砢几也不同意薛靖的意见。他提出了这样的看法：关于事物在质变状态时有没有矛盾的同一性问题，简单地答以
  “是”或“否”都是不对的，都是形而上学的片面性。列宁认为，辩证的转化和非辩证的转化的区别“在于飞跃，在于矛盾性，在于渐进过程的中断，在于存在和非存在的统一（同一）。”根据这一点，砢几认为，在质变状态中的同一性又存在又不存在，所以是存在与不存在的统一。
