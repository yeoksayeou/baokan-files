    Founding of the Guizhou Institute of Technology
    By our reporter Xiao Ming

    The Guizhou Institute of Technology was prepared in April 1958 and formally established in September of the same year. In its first academic year, it set up six departments and twelve majors, enrolling more than seven hundred students.

    The biggest difficulty encountered by the Guizhou Institute of Technology at the beginning was the shortage of teachers, which made it impossible to offer all courses. The institute mobilized existing teachers to "show their family assets." Teachers "showed" all the courses they could teach, or could teach with effort, and adopted methods such as one person teaching several courses, teachers teaching professional courses teaching basic courses, and teaching while learning, to overcome this difficulty. In order to improve the quality of teaching, especially to help young teachers who had just graduated to teach well, they also implemented collective lesson preparation, senior teachers gave demonstration lectures, and young teachers gave preliminary lectures to senior teachers. In this way, not only were all courses offered on time and as needed, but the quality of teaching was also guaranteed.

    The spirit of the Guizhou Institute of Technology in overcoming difficulties by its own efforts during the construction of the school is also vividly reflected in the labor of teachers and students participating in the construction of school buildings. After the students started classes in borrowed school buildings, the school's infrastructure construction became the focus of work. At this time, the engineering and construction departments of Guiyang City were busy with industrial construction and could not spare any resources. The borrowed school buildings were only enough for the first academic year's students. If some classrooms and dormitories were not built before the summer of the second year, it would be impossible to enroll students in 1959. When the Party committee raised this question to all teachers and students, the teachers and students expressed their confidence: students of industrial universities should learn to build houses, and they should better implement the Party's education policy on the school's infrastructure construction site, and build their own schools with their own hands. According to the requirements of the teachers and students, the Party committee of the institute decided to invite several experienced masters to provide guidance, and the teachers and students would build the school buildings themselves. The good ethos of combining teaching, labor, and scientific research should be established from the first batch of students.

    In November 1958, the students of the Civil Engineering Department, as the pioneers of school construction, were the first to carry their luggage and books and step onto the narrow paths to Xiaolongtan in the south of Guiyang City. As soon as they arrived there, they repaired bridges and roads, cut thatch, made adobe bricks, and built thatched sheds; they hung blackboards on the trunks of trees and held classes on the construction site. The two thatched houses still used as warehouses in the institute today, which do not provide any protection from the wind and cold, were the classrooms and dormitories of the Civil Engineering Department at that time.

    After the formal school building work began, the first step was to burn bricks. They searched for ingredient formulas from books and consulted with workers in brick and tile factories; without equipment, they found some broken wooden boards to make their own. The cold wind howled, and the young people stepped on the mud barefoot. When the first kiln of bricks was fired, they experienced for the first time the joy that laborers feel when they see the results of their labor. In order to improve efficiency, they studied technological innovations while stepping on the mud with their feet, first using cattle to step on the mud instead of people, and soon the cattle were no longer needed. The institute's extremely simple machinery factory manufactured a brick-making machine, which completely mechanized the brick-making process, and at full capacity, the daily output of bricks reached more than 50,000.

    In order to do a good job in infrastructure construction, the Party committee of the institute assigned tasks according to the specialties of each department. Teachers of the Civil Engineering Department were responsible for design, the Geology Department for laying the foundations, the Chemical Engineering Department for making bricks, the Civil Engineering Department for building walls, the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Department for making large and small machines for infrastructure construction and installing electrical wires, the Metallurgy Department was responsible for sand casting and forging, and others were specifically responsible for painting and other tasks. Most of the building materials were also solved by their own efforts. From mining stones, mixing sand, burning lime, making cement to sawing wood, all was done by themselves. Next to the building built by the teachers and students, the construction department was also building a building of the same type. The teachers and students took this building as an example and secretly encouraged themselves: "We must be as good as this building." As a result, after more than three months, the building was completed before the new students enrolled. Compared with the building next door, this building was more solid in quality, more beautiful in appearance, and lower in cost. All the teachers and students celebrated the birth of this building with joy. They could be proud that they were no longer talking on paper about the knowledge of building houses, but could really do it with real swords and guns.

    This summer, the teachers and students spent thirty-three days building a three-story building of 2,500 square meters that used no wood at all except for doors and windows, becoming a trial product in the Guizhou construction industry. In the past two years, the teachers and students have built tens of thousands of square meters of houses for the school, solving part of the school's needs.

    The site of the Guizhou Institute of Technology is separated from Guiyang City by a mountain called Jiebaikuan. If a gap is blasted open in this mountain to build a passage, it will be seven kilometers shorter. This idea coincided with the desire of the teachers and students of the Mining Department to find a "three-way combination" base, and they actively asked the school to undertake this engineering task. For young teachers and first-year students who lacked experience, it was very difficult to personally blast open the seventy-meter-thick mountain pass and carry out a large blasting operation with forty tons of explosives. However, the teachers and students believed that the more difficult it was, the more they could learn. Drilling holes seemed simple, as if it only required strength, but in practice, nine out of ten hammer blows were crooked. When detonating a pound or two of explosives, people would run away before the fire was even lit. After a month, these were no longer problems. Not only were they no longer hitting crooked blows, but they could also compete with the workers and often gained the upper hand. The Provincial Geological Bureau, the Railway Bureau and other agencies gave great support to these young students. The Railway Bureau sent experienced engineers and masters to help them and lent them seamless steel pipes, rubber pipes, and forging machines. The Geological Bureau supported air compressors and so on. The construction methods gradually changed from native to foreign, from slow to fast. From hammering holes by hand to drilling holes with pneumatic drills, from lighting candles to lighting electric lights. In just two months and four days, more than 400 meters of tunneling was completed. When loading explosives, all the teachers and students were mobilized, and the responsible comrades of the Party committee and the administration personally directed the operation. The blasting results fully met the design requirements, and the amount of blasted rock reached more than 70,000 cubic meters. A gap was opened in Jiebaikuan, and a road to Guiyang City was opened.

    It is indeed a great difficulty for a regular university to start classes without school buildings. However, the teachers and students of the Guizhou Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are good at turning difficulties into opportunities to practice their skills. The school's construction site has become a base for implementing the Party's education policy, an object of scientific research, and a place for learning and consolidating knowledge, exercising the body, and cultivating the feelings of the working people. At the construction site, in labor, each department combined the construction content with its own specialty to carry out learning and scientific research activities. The students of the Civil Engineering Department learned the construction structure and construction technology, construction organization, building materials, assembly line operation of bricklaying, types of large-scale bricklaying, thin-shell structure, and auxiliary enterprises of the project with the progress of construction. Some students have been able to undertake a complete set of construction organization work for a project. The students of the Mining and Geology Department learned a series of blasting operation techniques such as drilling, modifying explosives, supporting, and loading explosives, backfilling, and connecting external lines before blasting in the large blasting. The students of the Electrical Engineering Department combined the infrastructure construction to learn to install high-voltage lines and various power equipment used at the infrastructure construction site, and ensured the electricity supply at the construction site. They also researched and manufactured concrete mixers, brick-making machines, sawing machines, winches, lifting machines and other machines for the infrastructure construction site. The students of the Metallurgy Department made various castings and small rails for the construction site. Their creative labor made this construction site, which was originally entirely shoulder-carrying and back-carrying, rapidly move towards semi-mechanization.

    After two years of labor practice, the students of the Electrical Engineering Department can now repair electric wires on the construction site as easily as holding ordinary iron wires. Some of the most timid female students of the Mining Department are also dare to install explosives and light detonators. In the labor force of the institute's infrastructure construction site, whether it is heavy labor or technical labor, if you do not know them, you cannot tell whether they are workers, teachers or students. When ramming the earth, the workers took the lead, and the teachers and students sang the majestic work chants together. Who said they are not workers?

    In the past two years, although the students have spent more time participating in infrastructure construction labor, they have also achieved excellent academic results due to establishing a style of earnestly reading and studying diligently in their studies. Labor practice has also enabled students to more quickly establish the idea of scientific research facing production and facing reality. They are not only keen on building the school's infrastructure, but also solve technical problems for factories and mines in Guizhou, trial-produce new products, and regard this as the most glorious and urgent task.

    Now, the school buildings and campus construction of the Guizhou Institute of Technology have taken initial shape. The teachers and students who sweated for the construction of the school have written a glorious page in the history of the founding of this institute. In the years to come, all the students who enjoy this fruit will remember the previous generations of teachers and students who created the foundation for them with gratitude.

    贵州工学院创业记
    本报记者  萧明
    贵州工学院筹备于1958年4月，正式建立于同年9月。第一学年就设了六个系十二个专业，招收了七百多名学生。
    贵州工学院一开始碰到的最大困难是教师不够，开不齐课。学院就动员现有教师“亮家当”。教师们把自己所能教的，或经过努力能教的课都“亮”出来，采取一人兼教几门课、教专业课的老师教基础课、边学习边教课等办法来克服这个困难。为了提高教学质量，特别是帮助刚出校门的青年教师教好课，他们还实行集体备课，老教师示范讲课，青年教师向老教师进行预讲。这样，不仅按时按需要开齐全部课程，而且保证了教学质量。
    贵州工学院在建校过程中自己动手克服困难的精神，还特别生动地表现在师生参加修建校舍的劳动方面。当学生在借用的校舍里开课以后，学校的基本建设就成为工作的重心。这时贵阳市的工程建筑部门忙于工业建设，抽不出力量来。当时借用的校舍，只够第一学年学生用。如果在第二年暑期以前不修建起部分教室和宿舍，1959年就无法招生。当党委向全校师生提出这问题后，师生们充满信心地表示：工业大学的学生应该学会修建房子，要在学校的基本建设工地上来更好地贯彻党的教育方针，用自己的双手修建自己的学校。学院党委根据师生们的要求，便决定请几位老师傅作指导，由师生自己动手建筑校舍。教学、劳动、科学研究三结合的良好风尚，应该从第一批学生里树立起来。
    1958年11月间，作为建校先锋的土建系的学生，最先背着行李和书本，踩着羊肠小道来到贵阳城南的小龙潭。他们一到那里，就修桥补路，割茅草，打土坯，盖草棚；树干上挂块黑板，在施工场地上就地上课。现在学院里还留着作仓库用的两座茅草房，四面不遮风寒，便是当时土建系学生的教室和宿舍。
    正式建校工作开始以后，第一步是烧砖。他们从书本子上找寻配料方法，又到砖瓦场去向工人师傅请教；没有设备，便找些破木板来自己制造。冷风呼啸着，年青人光着脚踩泥巴。当第一窑砖烧成时，他们第一次体会到劳动者看到自己的劳动成果时的喜悦。为了提高效率，他们一边用脚踩泥，一边研究技术革新，先用牛踩代替人踩，不久以后牛也不用了，学院的设备极为简单的机械厂制成了制砖机，把制砖过程完全机械化了，开足马力，日产砖达到五万块以上。
    学院党委会为做好基本建设工作，按照各系特长分工负担任务。土建系教师搞设计，地质系打地基，化工系制砖，土建系砌墙，机电系制基建用的大小机具，安装电线，冶金系负责翻砂锤炼，其他粉刷油漆等都有专门负责的。建筑材料也大多数是自己动手解决。从开采石头、和沙子、烧石灰、制水泥到锯木板，全部自己动手。在师生们修建的这幢楼房的旁边，建筑部门也正在修建一座同型的楼房。师生们就以这幢楼房为榜样，暗中鼓着劲：“一定要比得上这座楼。”结果，花了三个多月，在新生入校以前，楼房竣工了。同旁边的楼房比较起来，这座楼房质量更坚固，外形更美观，造价更低廉。全校师生欢天喜地地庆祝这幢楼房的诞生，他们可以自豪的是，在修房子这门学问上，他们不再是纸上谈兵，而是能真刀真枪地干起来了。
    今年暑期，师生们又用三十三天的时间，修建起一幢除门窗外完全不用木材的二千五百平方米的三层楼房，成为贵州建筑业中的试制品。两年来，师生们共为学校建筑了成万平方米房子，解决了学校部分的需要。
    贵州工学院的校址同贵阳市之间，隔着一座山，名叫界白关。如果把这山炸开个口子，修一条通道，就可以少走七公里路。这个设想，正符合了采矿系师生物色“三结合”基地的愿望，他们积极向校方要求承担起这个工程任务。对于缺乏经验的青年教师和一年级的学生来说，要亲自动手炸开七十米厚的山垭，搞四十吨炸药的大爆破，是件十分困难的事。不过，师生们认为越是困难，就越能学到本事。打眼看起来简单，好像有力气就行，实际一干，十锤有九锤打成歪锤。放斤把重炸药的爆破，火还没点着，人就吓跑了。经过一个月后，这些都不成问题了，不但不再打歪锤，而且可以跟工人比赛，还常常占上风。省地质局、铁路局等机关对这些青年学生给予很大的支持。铁路局派了有经验的工程师和老师傅来帮助，借给他们无缝钢管、橡皮管、锻钎机，地质局支援空气压缩机等等。施工方法也渐渐由土到洋，由慢到快了。从手锤打眼到风钻钻眼，从点蜡烛到点电灯。只用了两个月零四天，打成掘进巷道四百多米。装炸药时，全校师生总动员，党委和行政的负责同志亲自指挥。爆破结果，完全符合设计要求，爆破石方达七万多。界白关打开了一个缺口，通向贵阳市的一条大道修通了。
    一个正规大学，没有校舍就开课，确是很大困难。但是，在毛泽东思想教导下的贵州工学院的师生们，善于把困难当成锻炼本事的机会。学校的基建工地成了贯彻党的教育方针的基地，成了科学研究的对象，成了学习和巩固知识、锻炼身体、培植劳动人民思想感情的场所。在工地上，在劳动中，各个系都结合施工内容和自己的专业，进行学习和科学研究活动。土建系的学生随着施工进度，学习了建筑构造与施工技术、施工组织、建筑材料、砌墙的流水作业、大型砌砖种类、薄壳结构、工程的附属企业等等，有些学生已经能够承担一个工程的全套施工组织工作；采矿系、地质系学生在大爆破中，学会了打眼、改装炸药、支架以及放炮前的装药、回填、联结传外线等一系列爆破中的操作技术；电机系的学生结合着基建，学会了安装高压线及各种基建工地用的动力设备，并且保证了工地用电，还为基建工地研究制成混凝土搅拌机、制砖机、锯板机、卷扬机、吊装机等等机具；冶金系的学生为工地制造各种铸件和小铁轨，他们的创造性的劳动，使这个原来完全是肩挑背驮的工地，迅速走向半机械化。
    经过两年劳动实践，现在电机系的学生，在工地上修理电线，就像拿着普通铁丝一样。采矿系一些最胆小的女学生，也都敢安装炸药、点雷管了。在学院基建工地的劳动队伍中，无论是笨重的劳动或技术性的劳动，如果你不认识他们的话，就无法分辨清那是工人，那是教师或学生。打夯时，工人带头，师生们跟着一起唱雄壮的号子，谁说他们不是工人呢？
    两年以来，学生们虽以较多的时间参加了基建劳动，但由于在学习上树立了认真读书刻苦钻研的学风，也取得了优良的学习成绩。劳动实践也使学生们更快地树立了科学研究面向生产面向实际的思想。他们不仅热衷于为学校搞基本建设，而且为贵州的厂矿企业解决技术上的疑难问题，试制新产品，并且把这当成最光荣最迫切的任务。
    现在，贵州工学院的校舍和校园的建设，已经初具规模。为建校流过汗的师生们，在这所学院的创业史上，写下了光荣的一页。在将来的年代里，所有享受这果实的学生们，都将以感激的心情，怀念为他们创下基业的前代师生们。
