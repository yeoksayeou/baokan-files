To Lay the Foundation for Achieving Laos' Peaceful Neutrality and National Unity
Prime Minister Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong Conclude Talks Successfully

The two sides issued a joint communiqué, unanimously agreeing that Laos must resolutely pursue a path of peaceful neutrality; must accept sincere assistance from all countries without any attached conditions and establish diplomatic relations with these countries; it is necessary to establish a coalition government including representatives of all nationalities, all patriotic parties, including the Lao Patriotic Front.
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 22nd (via cable) - According to a broadcast today from the Lao Combat Forces Radio, the Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, Prince Souvanna Phouma, and the Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, Prince Souphanouvong, held a meeting from November 18th to 20th in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and intimacy. The two princes issued a joint communiqué on the morning of the 20th regarding issues of peaceful neutrality, national harmony, foreign policy, acceptance of economic aid, and cooperation between the Royal Government and the Patriotic Front.

Attending the signing ceremony of the joint communiqué were, on the Royal Government side, Prime Minister Phouma and Champassak Phonexay; on the Patriotic Front side, Central Committee Chairman Prince Souphanouvong, Vice Chairman Kaysone Phomvihane, and Sithon Kommadam, head of the Lao Patriotic Front negotiation delegation Phoumi Vongvichit, and Tao Ma, acting governor of Sam Neua Province, among others.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 22nd - Vientiane Radio broadcast tonight the joint communiqué of the talks between the Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, Prince Souvanna Phouma, and the Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, Prince Souphanouvong. The full text of the communiqué is as follows:

On November 18, 1960, the Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government, honorary chairman of the "Committee for Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and Unified Nation," Prince Souvanna Phouma, visited Sam Neua, recently liberated from the shackles of the foreign interventionist lackeys Phoumi Nosavan and Boun Oum Na Champassak, and held talks in a pleasant and exciting atmosphere with the Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, former leader of the Lao Combat Forces, honorary chairman of the "Committee for Peaceful Neutrality, National Harmony, and Unified Nation," Prince Souphanouvong. The people of Sam Neua warmly received the Prince. On the 18th and 19th, Prince Souvanna Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong held cordial talks on the national situation and some major issues concerning the fate of the nation.

The two princes unanimously agreed that in the past, due to the interference of foreign reactionary forces and the sabotage of their lackeys, the policy of peaceful neutrality and national harmony jointly formulated by the former government of Prince Souvanna Phouma and the Lao Combat Forces could not be realized. Recently, the national people's struggle movement has surged. On August 9, 1960, the Vientiane troops, police, civil servants, and people, led by Captain Kong Le, launched a coup, overthrowing the Chao Somsanith and Phoumi Nosavan government and establishing the Souvanna Phouma government, unanimously approved by the National Assembly and ratified by the King. This government, in accordance with the people's wishes, announced that it would resolutely pursue a path of peaceful neutrality and has done some effective work, such as: excluding Phoumi Nosavan from the government; canceling the illegal cases against Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front; holding negotiations with the Lao Combat Forces—Lao Patriotic Front; establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union; and announcing that it would send friendly delegations to visit the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This resolute action has inspired the people's fighting spirit and further enhanced the government's prestige. However, the traitorous clique of Phoumi Nosavan and Boun Oum Na Champassak, relying on foreign forces, provoked a civil war in Laos, divided the motherland, declared opposition to the King and the Constitution, openly rebelled in Luang Prabang, attempted to overthrow the legitimate government, sabotage the policy of peaceful neutrality, and plunged Laos back into a state of darkness.

The legitimate government led by Prince Souvanna Phouma announced that it would not implement the instructions issued by the King under duress from the traitorous clique. The Lao people warmly welcomed Prince Souvanna Phouma's resolute attitude.

In the current chaotic situation in Laos, the two princes unanimously believe that:

	(1) Laos must resolutely pursue a path of peaceful neutrality. Since the world is currently divided into two camps—the socialist camp and the imperialist camp—Laos will not lean towards either camp, but will resolutely stand in the middle of these two camps, because this is the most suitable path for the current situation in Laos and in line with the people's wishes. Only in this way can we defend national independence, build a unified country, realize democratic and free rights, and unite all forces of the Lao people to build a progressive and prosperous motherland.

	(2) In order to consolidate the government's position, solve financial and economic difficulties, and create favorable conditions for the country's economic construction, the two princes believe that it is necessary to accept sincere assistance from all countries without any attached conditions and to establish diplomatic relations with these countries. In addition to aid from Britain, France, and the United States, Laos must now request assistance from peaceful neutral countries and socialist countries, and should establish economic and cultural relations with all countries with different political systems. Recently, relations in this area will be established with the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	(3) The two princes unanimously believe that the unity of the entire people is the decisive force for realizing a genuine policy of peaceful neutrality. The Lao Patriotic Front once again declares that it wholeheartedly supports the legitimate government and is fighting for Laos to become a truly peaceful and neutral country. The armed forces of the former Lao Combat Forces will follow the policies of the legitimate government in order to win victory in the struggle against the Phoumi-Boun Oum traitorous clique, and defend the motherland, religion, the King, and the Constitution. The Royal Government, with Prince Phouma as Prime Minister, guarantees to maintain the solid unity and mutual trust between the two sides in order to achieve national unity.

	(4) The two princes unanimously believe that it is necessary to establish a coalition government including representatives of all nationalities, all patriotic parties, including the Lao Patriotic Front, as a basis for realizing the people's wishes and for fighting for the independence, unity, prosperity, and happiness of Laos. As for the members of the so-called "Revolutionary Committee," apart from Phoumi Nosavan and Boun Oum Na Champassak, if they respect the legitimate government and support the policy of peaceful neutrality, they will obtain appropriate positions in the government.

The two princes, on behalf of the legitimate government and the Lao Patriotic Front, call on the King to take a firm stance against the traitorous clique and create favorable conditions for the legitimate government to complete its mission. The two princes call on the people of all strata and nationalities, all parties and religious believers, the army, police, civil servants, youth, and students to closely unite around the legitimate government, resolutely oppose the enemies of the policy of peaceful neutrality, in order to defend the legitimate government, defend the motherland, religion, the King, and the Constitution.

Finally, the two princes sincerely appeal to the governments and peoples of all countries in the world to give sympathy and assistance to the just struggle of the Lao government and people for defending independence, unifying the nation, for the peace of the people, and for contributing to the defense of world peace.
			Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of the Royal Lao Government
			Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front
				Sam Neua, November 20, 1960

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 22nd - Lao Combat Forces Radio today published a commentary, welcoming the joint communiqué issued by Prime Minister Phouma, representing the Royal Government, and Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front. The commentary pointed out that this joint communiqué has achieved a consensus on important issues for Laos, such as peaceful neutrality, national harmony, foreign policy, acceptance of foreign aid, and cooperation between the Royal Government and the Patriotic Front. This is an important event in the current stage of Laos and a huge new victory for the path of peaceful neutrality.

The commentary emphasized that this communiqué is all the more significant because it is being issued at a time when US imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique are concentrating all their efforts to step up the overthrow of the legitimate government of Laos, hold the King hostage, and plot to establish a puppet government of US imperialism's lackeys, and make this puppet government a tool for the United States to undermine Laos' policy of peaceful neutrality, turn Laos into a neo-colony and a base for war.

The commentary pointed out that the agreement reached by both sides on many major issues in Laos has brought about good practical results for the path of peaceful neutrality. This further proves that the Royal Government has recognized that in order to achieve genuine peaceful neutrality, it must express a clear attitude towards US imperialism, the traitorous clique, and those "two-faced" elements; it must unite all patriotic and peace-loving people and form a strong force; for US "aid," it must demand that they provide aid without any binding conditions. What is particularly important is to establish diplomatic relations with socialist countries and accept assistance from these countries.

The commentary then pointed out that the agreement reached between the Phouma government and the Lao Patriotic Front will inevitably cause panic among US imperialism and its lackeys, who will use all means to distort, slander, and threaten.

The commentary pointed out, but one thing is certain: the just actions of Prime Minister Phouma and the Patriotic Front will certainly receive the full support of all the Lao people and the people of the world. The commentary concluded by emphasizing that the increasingly powerful people's great unity will surely defeat all the conspiracies of US imperialism and the traitorous clique, and steadily advance on the path of peaceful neutrality and national harmony.

    为实现老挝的和平中立和全民团结奠定基础
    富马首相和苏发努冯亲王会谈圆满结束
    双方发表联合公报，一致认为老挝必须坚决奉行和平中立路线；必须接受各国真诚的、不附带任何束缚条件的援助，并且同这些国家建立外交关系；有必要成立包括各民族、各爱国党派、其中有老挝爱国战线党的代表的联合政府
    新华社河内22日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝王国政府首相梭发那·富马亲王和老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯亲王11月18日至20日在互相谅解的亲密的气氛中举行会晤，两位亲王在20日上午发表了关于和平中立、民族和睦、外交政策、接受经济援助、王国政府和爱国战线党实行合作等问题的联合公报。
    出席联合公报签署仪式的，王国政府方面有富马首相和占巴·丰马赞；爱国战线党方面有中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王，副主席凯山·丰威汉和西吞·库马丹，老挝爱国战线党谈判代表团团长富米·冯维希，桑怒省代理省长陶马等。
    新华社河内22日电　万象电台今晚广播了老挝王国政府首相梭发那·富马亲王和老挝爱国战线党主席苏发努冯亲王会谈联合公报。公报全文如下：
    1960年11月18日，老挝王国政府首相、“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”名誉主席梭发那·富马亲王到最近刚从外国干涉者的走狗富米·诺萨万和文翁·纳占巴塞的枷锁下解放出来的桑怒进行访问，并在愉快兴奋的气氛中同老挝爱国战线党主席、前寮国战斗部队领袖、“争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会”名誉主席苏发努冯亲王举行了会谈。桑怒人民非常热忱地接待了亲王。18和19两日，梭发那·富马亲王和苏发努冯亲王就国家局势和有关国家命运的一些重大问题，进行了亲切的会谈。
    两位亲王一致认为，过去期间，由于受到外国反动势力的干涉和它们的走狗的破坏，使梭发那·富马亲王前政府与寮国战斗部队所共同制订的和平中立和民族和睦政策不能得到实现。最近，全国人民的斗争运动已经高涨。1960年8月9日，由贡勒大尉领导的万象军队、警察、公务员和人民举行政变，推翻了昭·松萨尼特和富米·诺萨万政府，成立了由国会一致通过和国王批准的梭发那·富马亲王政府。这个政府根据人民的愿望，宣布将坚决奉行和平中立路线，并且做了一些具有良好效果的工作，如：把富米·诺萨万排除出政府；取消对苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领导人的非法案件；同寮国战斗部队—老挝爱国战线党举行谈判；同苏联建立外交关系；宣布将派遣友好代表团访问中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国。这种坚决的行动鼓舞了人民的奋发的精神和进一步提高了政府的威信。但是，富米·诺萨万和文翁·纳占巴塞叛国集团依靠外国的势力，挑起老挝的内战，分裂祖国，宣布反对国王和宪法，明目张胆地在琅勃拉邦市进行叛乱，企图推翻合法政府，破坏和平中立政策，并使老挝再次陷于黑暗的状态。
    由梭发那·富马亲王领导的合法政府宣布将不执行叛国集团逼迫国王所发布的指示。老挝人民热烈欢迎梭发那·富马亲王这种坚决的态度。
    在老挝当前混乱的情况下，两位亲王一致认为：
      （一）老挝必须坚决奉行和平中立路线，由于目前世界已经分成两个阵营——社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营，老挝将不倒向任何一个阵营，而坚决站在这两个阵营的中间，因为这是最适合老挝当前局势和符合人民愿望的路线。只有这样才能保卫民族独立，建设统一的国家，实现民主自由权利，联合老挝人民的一切力量，以建设进步、兴盛的祖国。
      （二）为了巩固政府的地位，解决财政经济方面的困难，为国家的经济建设创造顺利条件，两位亲王认为，必须接受各国真诚的、不附带任何束缚条件的援助，并同这些国家建立外交关系。除了英国、法国和美国的援助之外，现在老挝必须请求和平中立国家和社会主义国家的援助，应该同政治制度不同的所有各国建立经济和文化关系。最近，将同中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国建立这方面的关系。
      （三）两位亲王一致认为，全国人民的团结，是实现真正的和平中立政策的具有决定性的力量。老挝爱国战线党再一次声明，它全心全意地拥护合法政府，并为老挝成为真正和平中立的国家而斗争。前寮国战斗部队的武装力量将遵循合法政府的政策，以便在同富米—文翁叛国集团进行的斗争中争取胜利，保卫祖国、宗教、国王和宪法。由富马亲王为首相的王国政府保证将维护双方的巩固的团结和互相间的信赖，以便实现全民的团结。
      （四）两位亲王一致认为，有必要成立包括各民族、各爱国党派、其中有老挝爱国战线党的代表的联合政府，以作为实现人民的愿望和为老挝的独立、统一、繁荣和幸福而斗争的基础。对于所谓“革命委员会”的成员，除了富米·诺萨万和文翁·纳占巴塞之外，如果他们尊重合法政府和赞成和平中立政策，他们将在政府中获得适当的地位。
    两位亲王代表合法政府和老挝爱国战线党，呼吁国王对叛国集团采取坚决态度，为合法政府完成自己的任务创造有利条件。两位亲王号召各阶层和各民族人民、各党派和各宗教教徒、军队、警察、公务员、青年、学生紧密地团结在合法政府的周围，坚决反对和平中立政策的敌人，以保卫合法政府，保卫祖国、宗教、国王和宪法。
    最后，两位亲王真诚地呼吁世界各国政府和人民对老挝政府和人民为保卫独立、统一国家，为人民的安宁和为保卫世界和平作出贡献而进行的正义斗争，给予同情和援助。

                            1960年11月20日于桑怒
    新华社河内22日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天发表评论，欢迎富马首相代表王国政府同老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王发表的联合公报。评论指出，这项联合公报对老挝的重要问题，如和平中立、民族和睦、对外政策、接受外国援助和王国政府同爱国战线党之间的合作等问题取得了一致的看法，这是老挝当前阶段的重要事件，是和平中立路线的巨大的新胜利。
    评论强调指出，这项公报所以具有更为重大的意义是由于它是在这样的时候发表的：美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团正集中一切力量加紧实现推翻老挝合法政府，挟持国王，阴谋成立美帝国主义的走狗傀儡政府，并使这个傀儡政府成为美国破坏老挝和平中立政策、把老挝变成新殖民地和战争基地的工具。
    评论指出，双方就老挝的许多重大问题达成协议，给和平中立路线带来了良好的实际结果。这更加证明了王国政府已经认清，要实现真正的和平中立，必须对美帝国主义、叛国集团和那些
  “两头蛇”分子表示明确的态度；必须团结一切爱国爱和平的人士，结成坚强的力量；对美国的“援助”，必须要求它们给以不附带任何约束条件的援助。特别重要的是，要同社会主义国家建立外交关系，并接受这些国家的援助。
    评论接着指出，富马政府同老挝爱国战线党取得一致意见，必将引起美帝国主义及其走狗的惊慌，它们将使用一切手段来进行歪曲、诬蔑和威胁。
    评论指出，但是肯定的一点是：富马首相和爱国战线党的正义行动一定会获得全体老挝人民和世界人民的全力支持。评论最后强调说，日益强大的人民大团结，一定能够击败美帝国主义和叛国集团的一切阴谋，并在和平中立和民族和睦的道路上稳步前进。
