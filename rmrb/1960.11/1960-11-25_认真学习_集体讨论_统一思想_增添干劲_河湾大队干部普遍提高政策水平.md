Conscientious Study, Collective Discussion, Unified Thinking, Increased Enthusiasm
Cadres of the Hwan Brigade Universally Improve Policy Level

(Our dispatch) The Party General Branch of the Hwan Brigade in Majie Commune, Pingdingshan City, Henan Province, has deeply and meticulously implemented the Party's policies in all its work, mobilizing the production enthusiasm of cadres and members, and powerfully promoting agricultural production.

The Party General Branch of the Hwan Brigade realized in practice that to correctly implement the Party's policies, it is necessary to improve the policy level of all party member cadres and enhance the cadres' awareness of implementing policies. Therefore, they often organize party members and cadres to study the Party's guidelines and policies. This spring, the brigade's general branch established a system of concentrated study for seven days at a time. Based on the principle of studying what is needed for the work at hand, each time a study document is designated, and key points are put forward for everyone to think and discuss. For example, when studying the instructions on concentrating labor and strengthening the agricultural production front line, the Party General Branch raised the questions: Why is such an instruction issued now? How should our Hwan Brigade conscientiously implement it, etc.? Through discussion, everyone not only understood theoretically the importance of concentrating superior forces and strengthening the agricultural production front line for the development of agricultural production, but also examined the problems existing in the brigade's past use of labor. Because everyone studied well and improved their ideological level, the correct implementation of the Party's policies was guaranteed. Through accounting by teams, the entire brigade excavated a large number of laborers to invest in agricultural production. The number of laborers directly participating in field work increased from 757 in the past to more than 1,200, accounting for more than 80% of the total labor force.

In practice, the Party General Branch of the Hwan Brigade also experienced that mastering policies and implementing policies are not always smooth sailing and without ideological struggle. Therefore, in leading the study of the Party's policies, they paid attention to guiding everyone to closely integrate with reality, put forward different views and opinions, and repeatedly discuss them to achieve unified thinking and improve understanding. For example, on the issue of organizing collaboration within the brigade, some people once believed that since the basic team ownership system is now implemented, equal value exchange is not required for collaboration. Some comrades disagreed with this view. In order to unify understanding, the brigade's Party General Branch organized all cadres for a special discussion. Through discussion, everyone unanimously believed that implementing equal value exchange in collaboration can mobilize the enthusiasm of production teams, correctly resolve the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, and ensure that all farm work is completed on time while fully reflecting the spirit of the policy of more pay for more work. After the cadres unified their thinking, the brigade also formulated collaboration methods of exchanging labor for labor and accounting for payment, so that collaboration between production teams has always been based on equal value exchange, voluntary mutual benefit.

Due to the different ideological levels and work experiences of the cadres, their understanding of the policies also varies. Therefore, some problems may still occur in the actual implementation of the Party's policies. Based on this situation, the Party General Branch of the Hwan Brigade often goes deep into the teams to provide specific assistance. For example, in the fertilizer accumulation campaign, the Mengzhuang Production Team, due to the conscientious implementation of the system of collective fertilizer accumulation as the main method, combined with collective fertilizer accumulation and family fertilizer accumulation by commune members, and adopted the method of pricing according to quality, purchasing with cash or recording work points to reward commune members' family fertilizer accumulation, stimulated the enthusiasm of commune members for fertilizer accumulation. Both collective fertilizer accumulation and family fertilizer accumulation were done very well. The Hwan Production Team did not implement the policy of rewarding fertilizer accumulation well enough, and the effect was not as good as that of the Mengzhuang Team. After discovering this problem, the brigade's Party General Branch helped them study and discuss the experience of the Mengzhuang Production Team, cleared up the commune members' fertilizer accumulation accounts, recorded work points where work points were due, and paid for what was due, and formulated specific measures for pricing according to quality and rewarding fertilizer accumulation. The commune members' family fertilizer accumulation in this team also quickly improved. This example gave everyone great enlightenment. Li Hai, the Party Branch Secretary of the Hwan Production Team, said: "In the past, I only thought about completing the task and that was it. Who knew that without a good implementation of the Party's policies, the result would be that it took a lot of effort, and the work would not be able to keep up. This time, it was like giving me a dose of cooling medicine."

Due to the thorough and correct implementation of the Party's various policies by the Party General Branch of the Hwan Brigade, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and commune members has been greatly mobilized, promoting the sustained leap forward in agricultural production.

    认真学习　集体讨论　统一思想　增添干劲
    河湾大队干部普遍提高政策水平
    本报讯　河南省平顶山市马街公社河湾大队党总支，在各项工作中深入细致地贯彻执行党的政策，调动了干部和社员的生产积极性，有力地推动了农业生产。
    河湾大队党总支在实际工作中体会到，要正确贯彻执行党的政策，必须提高全体党员干部的政策水平，提高干部执行政策的自觉性。因此他们经常组织党员和干部学习党的方针、政策。今年春季，大队总支建立了七天集中学习一次的制度。根据干什么、学什么的原则，每次都指定学习文件，并提出重点，供大家思考讨论。比如，在学习关于集中劳动力，加强农业生产第一线的指示时，党总支提出：当前为什么要发出这样指示？我们河湾大队应该如何认真贯彻执行等问题。通过讨论，不仅使大家从理论上懂得了集中优势力量，加强农业生产第一线对发展农业生产的重要意义，而且也检查了本队过去在使用劳动力上存在的问题。由于大家学得好，提高了思想水平，就保证了党的政策正确贯彻执行。全大队通过站队算账，挖出了一大批劳动力投入农业生产，直接参加田间劳动的劳动力，由过去的七百五十七名增加到一千二百多名，占总劳动力的80％以上。
    在工作实践中，河湾大队党总支还体验到掌握政策、执行政策并不都是畅行无阻、没有思想斗争的。因此，他们在领导学习党的政策中，注意引导大家紧密联系实际，提出不同的看法和见解，反复进行讨论，达到统一思想，提高认识的目的。如大队内组织协作问题，曾有人认为：现在实行的是基本队有制，进行协作不需要等价交换。也有些同志不同意这种意见。大队党总支为了统一认识，就组织全体干部进行了专题讨论。通过讨论，大家一致认为：在协作中实行等价交换，可以调动生产队的积极性，正确解决先进与落后之间的矛盾，既能保证一切农活按时完成，又能充分体现多劳多得的政策精神。在干部统一思想认识后，大队还制订出了以工换工和记账付款的协作办法，使生产队之间的协作，一直建立在等价交换、自愿互利的基础上。
    由于干部的思想水平、工作经历不同，对政策的理解程度也不一样。因此，在实际贯彻执行党的政策中还会发生一些问题。根据这一情况，河湾大队党总支便经常深入各队进行具体帮助。如在积肥运动中，孟庄生产队由于认真贯彻执行了以集体积肥为主、集体积肥和社员家庭积肥相结合的制度，采取按质论价，现款收购或记工的办法，奖励社员家庭积肥，激发了社员的积肥积极性。集体积肥和社员家庭积肥搞得都很好。河湾生产队由于对奖励积肥的政策贯彻不够，效果不如孟庄队。大队党总支发现这一问题后，就帮助他们学习讨论了孟庄生产队的经验，清理了社员积肥账目，该记工的记工，该付款的付款，并制定了按质论价、奖励积肥的具体办法，这个队社员家庭积肥也很快搞起来了。这一实例，给了大家很大启示，河湾生产队党支部书记李孩说：“过去只想着完成任务就算完事，谁知不很好地贯彻党的政策，结果是费力不小，工作还赶不上去。这回算是叫我吃了一付清凉剂。”
    河湾大队党总支由于深入、正确地贯彻执行了党的各项政策，极大地调动了广大干部和社员的生产积极性，推动农业生产持续跃进。
