    Good Canteen Advisor—Yan Jingqing
    Yan Jingqing, a staff member of the Qinxian County People's Committee in Shanxi, was sent down by the county to the Second Production Team of the Xihedi Management Area in Chengguan Commune in August of this year to serve as the deputy team leader. He is not only a good leader in production but also a good advisor for running the canteen.
    After Yan Jingqing arrived at the production team, he learned that someone was needed to help run the canteen well. So he volunteered and asked to be a cook in the canteen. When Comrade Yan Jingqing arrived at the canteen, he didn't know anything at first. He carried water, fanned the fire, scrubbed pots, and fed pigs, learning and studying while doing. He quickly grasped the general idea of the work in the canteen. In response to the lack of a sense of responsibility and creativity among some cooks, he decided to conduct political and ideological education for the canteen staff. Yan Jingqing deeply understood their thoughts and organized everyone to study relevant documents. He also discussed how to run the canteen well and the relationship between life and production, and whether cooking was glorious. After ideological education, the cooks' awareness was greatly improved, and the original problems of not being content with cooking, digging coal, fanning fire, and feeding pigs were resolved. Mo Shouzhen and seven other clever housewives voluntarily asked to cook in the canteen. At the same time, the administrator was adjusted, a new cook was assigned, canteen rules were formulated, a food and living committee was established, and the food accounts were cleared daily and settled monthly. A comparison and competition campaign was also launched among the cooks. From then on, the cooks were full of energy, used their brains, implemented planned use of grain and vegetables, and the variety of cooking increased, and the food improved greatly.

    食堂好参谋——阎景庆
    山西沁县人委会科员阎景庆，是今年8月由县里下放到城关公社西河底管理区第二生产队当副队长的。他不仅是生产上的好领班，而且是办食堂的好参谋。
    阎景庆到了生产队后，了解到需要有人去帮助办好食堂。于是他就自告奋勇，要求到食堂当炊事员。阎景庆同志到食堂后，开始什么也不会，他就担水、煽火、刷锅、喂猪，边做边学边研究，很快的就把食堂的工作大体摸着了。他针对有些炊事人员对工作缺乏责任心和创造性的情况，便决定对食堂人员进行政治思想教育。阎景庆深入了解思想，组织大家学习了有关文件。并就如何办好食堂，生活同生产的关系，做饭是不是光荣等问题进行了讨论。经过思想教育，大大提高了炊事人员的觉悟，原来不安心做饭、挖煤、煽火、喂猪的问题都解决了。莫守珍等七个巧媳妇自动要求到食堂做饭。同时，调整了管理员，换了一个做饭的，制定了食堂规则，建立了伙食生活委员会，伙食账目做到日清月结，还在炊事人员中开展了评比竞赛运动。从此，炊事人员干劲十足，开动脑筋，实行计划用粮、计划吃菜，做饭花样也多了，伙食有了很大改进。（附图片）
