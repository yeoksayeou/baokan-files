    Always Promote the "Poor Stick" Spirit
    Zhao Zengyi, First Secretary of the CPC Kunming Municipal Committee

    For more than two years, we have consistently advocated and adhered to the "poor stick" spirit on the industrial front in Kunming, and it has been further developed and enhanced in the construction endeavors. Most of Kunming's factories, especially those belonging to the city and districts, were established and developed relying on this spirit.

    Kunming is a city located on the southwestern border of our country, with inconvenient transportation and a very weak industrial base. Before the Second Five-Year Plan, although there had been a certain degree of change in the backwardness of the industry after a series of restorations and developments, it was still constrained by certain traditional ideas at that time, and the establishment of industry was seen as excessively mysterious. In the spring of 1958, the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies gave us great inspiration and encouragement, our minds were opened, and a mass movement for the whole people to run industry was launched. In this movement, there were two completely different ideas and practices. Some people believed that running industry required the state to allocate funds, build factories, and transfer equipment, and nothing could be done without these. Therefore, they had to "look upwards with both eyes and reach outwards with both hands," relying and waiting, and the result was inevitably missing opportunities and accomplishing nothing. Others, however, based on the "poor stick" spirit, emphasized self-reliance and starting from scratch. They posed the question to themselves: "If a kitchen knife can make a revolution, why can't two pairs of pliers start a factory?" Under the guidance of this idea, some factories were not only quickly established, but also rapidly developed. The Kunming Electric Motor Factory, which can now produce electric motors in large quantities, is a clear example. This factory was originally a motor repair group with only a dozen people and a few simple repair tools. Later, they used a dilapidated warehouse from another factory as a workshop and started working in a makeshift manner. In less than half a year, it developed into a relatively decent small electric motor manufacturing plant, undertaking the motor matching tasks for more than twenty machinery factories. The path this factory has taken has been very enlightening in resolving the ideological problems of dependence and waiting among some cadres.

    In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, we relied on the "poor stick" spirit and achieved a great victory in the whole people running industry. In that year, the city's total industrial output value increased by one and a half times compared with 1957, and the output of major products almost doubled. More importantly, the large-scale steelmaking laid a solid foundation for sustained leap forward. By 1959, with the needs of the development of the entire construction industry, many enterprises were facing new tasks of "upgrading" and turning to the production of "high, large, and sophisticated" products. Under the new situation, some people's old problems relapsed, and they felt that the conditions were different from the past, and it might not work to rely on poor methods. Moreover, how could "high, large, and sophisticated" products be made without foreign equipment? According to them, "golden phoenixes cannot fly out of chicken coops," so they "waited for foreign things." Others, however, held the opposite view. They continued to adhere to the "poor stick" path, believing that "indigenous methods can generate foreign methods" and "chicken feathers can fly to the sky." As a result, the Kunming Power Machinery Factory, without large factory buildings, lacking large equipment, and with insufficient technical strength, manufactured huge steam engines that "required the roof to be removed for assembly and the gate to be dismantled for delivery" and relatively sophisticated air compressors. This once again made the vast number of cadres and workers deeply realize from their own practice that not only is it necessary to rely on the "poor stick" spirit in the early stage of establishing a factory, but it is also necessary to rely on this spirit when further developing and improving and carrying out technological transformation of enterprises. Last year, the city's local industry launched a great upsurge of "upgrading," improving, and creating "high, large, and sophisticated" products, which developed on this ideological basis. It has played a significant role in improving the production technology level of those newly established city, district, and commune industries.

    The practice of two years of continuous Great Leap Forward has powerfully proved that under the brilliant light of the Party's general line, as long as we adhere to and promote the "poor stick" spirit, our construction endeavors will be able to achieve rapid and vigorous development, and any difficulties standing in our way can be overcome. Therefore, since this year, in carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement centered on "four modernizations," many enterprises are still launching the masses to march towards industrial modernization in this spirit. As a result, the appearance of the enterprises has undergone fundamental changes in a very short period of time. The Kunming Forging Factory's past production methods were relatively backward, and most workers were engaged in heavy manual labor. In the technical revolution, they made the ambitious determination to "climb as high as the sky and drill as deep as the earth," made their own equipment, and tackled the forging problem, resulting in the realization of a mechanized production line where "large parts do not need to be carried by people, and small parts do not need to be hammered by hand." The Yunnan Towel Factory is also like this. This year, in order to meet the needs of the market, they "did not wait or rely, but everyone worked together to make" and finally manufactured 110 all-iron towel machines, wide-width machines, warp machines, and ironing machines in half a year. The factory has been completely renovated, and the variety and quality of the products have been significantly increased and improved. Now, compared with half a year ago, it is indeed a completely new look.

    The "poor stick" spirit is not only reflected in the technical innovation and self-made equipment in production, but also many enterprises, due to the needs of continuous production development and the inability to schedule basic construction, have also built their own factory buildings. According to preliminary statistics from the city's three industrial bureaus of machinery and electronics, chemical industry, and light industry alone, the self-built projects since this year have reached more than 30,000 square meters. Among them, the Kunming Lac Factory and the Anning Chemical Factory built a total of about 8,000 square meters of factory buildings by themselves, without any investment, construction force, or building materials, by burning bricks and tiles, quarrying stone, and using bamboo mat sheds and old wooden strips, respectively, solving the problem of insufficient production space. Now, for many enterprises in Kunming, "building factories without factory buildings, making equipment without equipment, finding materials without materials, and learning technology without technology" is no longer just a slogan, but the actual action of the vast number of employees.

    In the practice of production and construction in the past few years, we have always firmly grasped the "poor stick" spirit, promoted it widely, advocated it greatly, and carried it forward greatly. We have often used comparative methods to establish clear opposites to educate and improve cadres and the masses. As a result, people's mental outlook has also undergone great changes. Many people deeply realize that: "Self-reliance is vigorous and lively; waiting for rice to cook is cold and desolate," "'Self' is in the lead, the atmosphere is magnificent; 'Waiting' is in the lead, it is difficult to move forward." At the same time, through practice, they have further understood that: in our construction endeavors, always relying on and adhering to the "poor stick" spirit is not only a simple method problem, nor is it a temporary expedient, but a fundamental guideline in the entire socialist construction process. This spirit is not only needed for revolution in the past, but also needed for construction now and in the future; not only needed by poor factories and small factories, but also needed by large factories and modern factories; not only needed when "starting a family" in running a factory, but also needed when further improving and marching towards industrial modernization; not only needed in industrial and agricultural production and construction, but also needed in other construction undertakings. In fact, many units and examples of "building a family and starting a business" by relying on the "poor stick" spirit have also appeared in the city's cultural and educational, financial and trade, and other departments.

     The "poor stick" spirit is a vivid generalization of the characteristics of ambition, daring to think and act, self-reliance, and striving for strength. Chairman Mao said in the editor's note to the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" that the "poor stick cooperative" with only three donkey legs – the agricultural cooperative led by Wang Guofan – "used their own efforts to 'take from the mountains' a large number of means of production in three years, which moved some visitors to tears," and pointed out: "This is the image of our entire country." It is precisely because many such "images" have appeared on the industrial front in Kunming that they have powerfully promoted our construction endeavors to develop by leaps and bounds. The "poor stick" spirit is also a manifestation of a fearless spirit in the face of difficulties. In our construction endeavors, we will always encounter this or that difficulty. Our country is a large country with a large population and is very backward in economy and science and technology. It is inconceivable that there will be no difficulties in carrying out unprecedented and great construction. However, we have never been intimidated by difficulties, and we will never bow our heads in the face of any difficulties. Because the difficulties we encounter are difficulties in the course of progress, difficulties in the course of development, and temporary difficulties. These difficulties themselves contain factors that can be overcome. Chairman Mao pointed out in the article "Welcome the New Upsurge of the Chinese Revolution": "Both the reactionary forces and we have difficulties. However, the difficulties of the reactionary forces cannot be overcome, because they are forces that are close to death and have no future. Our difficulties can be overcome, because we are emerging forces with a bright future." Therefore, we follow this truth and treat any difficulties in production and construction in the same way as we treat class enemies. We always despise them strategically and as a whole, and at the same time, we must attach importance to them tactically and in specific work arrangements, and effectively solve every difficulty in the work. Since this year, many enterprises in Kunming have also encountered some major and minor difficulties in the continuous leap forward of production and construction. However, they have continued to carry forward the "poor stick" spirit, overcome difficulties, and achieved remarkable results. The Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory has once again set a good example for us in this regard. This factory wants to realize a major revolution in product output this year and has encountered many difficulties in its work. According to this situation, the factory's party organization summarized the experience of fighting against difficulties in the past few years and proposed the slogan of one no waiting (do not wait for others to help when encountering difficulties), two no yielding (not yielding when solving difficulties), three consultations (consult with the masses when there are difficulties), four supports (enthusiastically supporting various initiatives to overcome difficulties), and five problem-solving (also often setting difficult problems for yourself), fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the vast number of employees. They also combined planned technological transformation with the extensive development of mass "four small" movements (small innovation, small tricks, small improvements, and small creations), constantly solving contradictions and overcoming difficulties. Therefore, they were able to achieve the major victory of completing the annual product output plan, which was 4.8 times higher than the same period last year, ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, while reducing the number of employees by one-third.

    Opposed to the "poor stick" spirit are feelings of inferiority, "condition-ism," reaching out for help, and the world view of cowards and lazy people who "drag their feet, have many difficulties, and say that this is impossible and that cannot be done." In the relationship between "self" and "waiting," they do not put "self" in the lead and lack the ambition to "take from the mountains," but instead put "waiting" in the lead, always looking up to external support and upper-level assistance. In the relationship between indigenous and foreign methods, they do not adhere to both indigenous and foreign methods, but look down on indigenous methods and cannot achieve foreign methods, so they can only sigh at "foreign" things. In the relationship between people and things, they always see things but not people, stubbornly cling to "conditions," emphasize objective difficulties, and fail to see the subjective initiative of people. Some factories and enterprises, although possessing the same material and technical conditions as other units, or even better conditions than other units, have achieved very different achievements in production and construction and technological revolution due to the wrong mental state. There are two such cement plants in Kunming. One is a modern enterprise with a complete set of new equipment, and its technology and machine repair capabilities are also quite strong. However, for the weak links in its own production, it has always been waiting for the state to arrange basic construction projects and is unwilling to do it itself. Although some transformations have also been carried out in the technical revolution, after entering the consolidation and improvement stage, many innovation projects are in a state of dismantling (dismantling), displaying (displaying without use), and delaying (delaying without doing), and the enterprise's appearance remains "as it was," and production growth is very slow. The other small plant, which is half indigenous and half foreign, although its technology and equipment conditions are relatively poor, dares to compete with units that have much better conditions than itself. They carried out major technological transformations targeting the key to production, and basically realized mechanization in all processes such as mining, transportation, crushing, and firing in just half a year, and production has greatly increased compared with the same period last year. The main reason for the huge difference between these two plants in production and technological revolution is that their thinking is not "the same." One is "taking from the mountains," while the other is hoping to "wait for it." Between "taking" and "waiting," this reflects two completely different mental states, and different mental states produce two opposite results. Therefore, to promote the "poor stick" spirit, we must vigorously oppose feelings of inferiority, "condition-ism," reaching out for help, and break the world view of cowards and lazy people. Without breaking, there is no establishing. Without eliminating these things, it is impossible to adhere to the "poor stick" spirit and rapidly develop the cause of socialist construction.

    Why do we advocate this "poor stick" spirit in the construction endeavor? Why can such a significant role be played politically and economically as soon as it is advocated? Objectively speaking, it is because we are poor, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The most prominent feature of China's 600 million people is that they are poor and blank" "Poverty leads to the desire for change, the desire to work, and the desire to make revolution." Subjectively speaking, the "poor stick" spirit precisely reflects the strong desire of the people to rapidly change the face of "poverty and blankness." More importantly, the "poor stick" spirit is the class consciousness of the proletariat and is determined by the Marxist-Leninist world view. The proletariat bears the historical mission of eradicating all systems of exploitation, has the lofty ideal of building communism, and holds steadfast confidence in victory in the revolutionary cause it is engaged in. Therefore, they have ambition, dare to think and act, are not afraid of any difficulties and obstacles, and always maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm and a high degree of revolutionary optimism. They firmly believe in the truth of "self-liberation" and understand that "the liberation of the people's masses themselves can only be obtained, maintained and consolidated by the people's masses themselves rising up to struggle and striving for it; it cannot be bestowed or given by anyone outside the masses, nor can anyone outside the masses replace the masses to strive for it." (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party") Therefore, whether in the cause of revolution or construction, we have always emphasized relying on our own strength, working hard, striving for strength, and never simply relying on and waiting. Only in this way can all positive factors be fully mobilized, so that the broad masses have a place to use their talents in production and construction. We emphasize self-reliance and promoting the "poor stick" spirit, which is closely linked to the implementation of the Party's mass line.

    The "poor stick" spirit is also a fine and glorious tradition of our Party. In the past, many places started the revolution and engaged in armed struggle by "starting with a kitchen knife" and "building the country with two and a half broken rifles." During the most difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of the liberated areas responded to Chairman Mao's great call of "self-reliance" and "sufficient food and clothing" and launched a vigorous mass production movement, finally overcoming the serious economic difficulties caused by the encirclement and blockade by the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the War of Liberation, we used "millet plus rifles" to defeat the Kuomintang reactionary army equipped entirely with American equipment. Now, our advocacy of relying on the "poor stick" spirit for construction is precisely the inheritance and development of this fine tradition of our Party.

    The role that the promotion of the "poor stick" spirit can play in practical work has been proven by the practice of more than two years. However, why could this spirit not be fully developed in the past and play such a clear role in the cause of production and construction as it does now? Of course, this requires a process of understanding and practice, but more importantly, it is the proposal of the Party's general line for socialist construction and a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies, and the in-depth development of the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works. It can be said that without arming people's minds with the general line and Mao Zedong Thought, the "poor stick" spirit could not have exerted such great power in the construction endeavor. The general line helped people break superstitions, eliminate feelings of inferiority, and remove the heavy shackles on their minds, which provided the maximum possibility for the development of the "poor stick" spirit. Mao Zedong Thought, as many people figuratively call it, is a "universal golden key." With this "key," people's minds can be "opened," and the treasure house of the endless wisdom and strength hidden in the masses can be opened, and the enthusiasm of the masses can be mobilized to the fullest. Many "poor stick" enterprises in Kunming, like the Kunming Pneumatic Tool Factory, have encountered many difficulties in the process of "starting a business" and development. Some people have blown cold winds at them, but because they have drawn strength from Chairman Mao's works, they have finally been able to overcome difficulties, withstand the cold winds, and achieve victory. Many cadres have such an experience: "If you don't have enough drive, check your thinking. If your thinking is not clear, debate it. If you have no way, find the masses. If the direction is not clear, study the theory." Many difficult problems have been found in Chairman Mao's works. the answer.

    The "poor stick" spirit is a valuable style of our time. Through the Party's education and the practice of production and construction in the past few years, this spirit has taken root in the minds of the vast number of cadres and the masses. Now, as we are vigorously carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy with grain and steel as the center under the guidance of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and ensuring the continuous leap forward of our various construction endeavors, further promoting the "poor stick" spirit and promoting the fine revolutionary traditions of our Party's hard struggle, down-to-earth work, hard work, and striving for strength is undoubtedly of greater significance.

    永远要发扬“穷棒子”精神
    中共昆明市委第一书记　赵增益
    两年多来，在昆明的工业战线上，始终提倡和坚持“穷棒子”精神，并在建设事业中得到进一步的发扬光大。昆明的很多工厂，特别是市、区属工厂，绝大部分都是依靠了这种精神创办和发展起来的。
    昆明是个地处祖国西南边疆的城市，交通不便，工业基础很差。第二个五年计划以前，虽然经过了一系列的恢复和发展，工业落后的面貌有了一定程度的改变，但那时仍然受着某些传统观念的束缚，把办工业看得过分神秘。1958年春，党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”方针的提出，给了我们极大的启发和鼓舞，思想上开了窍，一个全民大办工业的群众运动兴起来了。在这个运动中，有两种截然不同的想法和作法。有些人认为，办工业反正就得国家拨资金、修厂房、调设备，没有这些总归不行。于是，只好“两眼向上，两手向外”，依赖、等待，其结果就必然是坐失良机，一事无成。而另一些人则是本着“穷棒子”精神，强调自己动手，白手起家。他们这样给自己提出问题：“一把菜刀能闹成革命，为什么两把老虎钳办不起工厂？”在这种思想指导下，有些工厂不仅很快地办了起来，而且迅速地得到了发展。像现在可以大量生产电动机的昆明电工厂，就是一个明显的例证。这个厂原是一个电机修理小组，一开始只有十几个人和一点简单的修理工具，后来他们利用了别厂的一个破旧仓库作厂房，因陋就简、七拼八凑地干了起来，不到半年就发展成为一个比较像样的小型电机制造厂，担负了二十多个机械工厂的电机配套任务。这个厂所走过的道路，对于解决一部分干部的依赖、等待等思想问题起了很大的启发作用。
    在1958年的大跃进中，我们依仗“穷棒子”精神，取得了全民大办工业的伟大胜利。这一年全市工业总产值比1957年增长一倍半，主要产品产量几乎是成倍地增长。更重要的是大办了钢铁，就为持续跃进打下了坚实的基础。到1959年，随着整个建设事业发展的需要，很多企业面临着“升级”并转向生产“高、大、精”产品的新任务。在新形势下，有一些人旧病复发，又觉得现在条件比过去不同了，还依靠穷办法，恐怕不见得能行吧？何况是搞“高、大、精”产品，没有洋设备怎么能办得到？按照他们的说法是“鸡窝里飞不出金凤凰来”，于是“坐以待洋”。而另外一些人则与此相反，他们继续坚持“穷棒子”道路，认定“土能生洋”“鸡毛可以上天”，结果出现了像昆明动力机械厂那样，在一无大厂房，二缺大设备，三是技术力量不足的情况下，制造出了“装配掀屋顶、提货拆大门”的庞大蒸气机和比较精密的空气压缩机。这就再一次地使广大干部、工人群众从自己的实践中深刻地体会到，不仅办厂初期需要依靠“穷棒子”精神，就是在进一步发展提高和对企业进行技术改造时，也同样需要依靠这种精神。去年，全市地方工业掀起大“升级”、大提高、大造“高、大、精”产品的热潮，就是在这个思想基础上发展起来的。它对于那些新兴办的市、区和公社工业，在生产技术水平的提高上起了很大作用。
    两年持续大跃进的实践，有力地证明了在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，只要坚持和发扬“穷棒子”精神，我们的建设事业就能够获得突飞猛进的发展，横在我们前进道路上的任何困难，都是可以被克服的。因此，今年以来，在开展以“四化”为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动中，不少企业仍然是本着这种精神发动群众向工业现代化进军，结果在很短时期内就使企业面貌发生了根本变化。昆明锻造厂过去的生产方法比较落后，大多数工人都是从事笨重体力劳动。在技术革命中他们立下了“天高要攀，地厚要钻”的雄心大志，自制土设备，大攻锻造关，结果实现了“大件不用人扛打，小件不用手锤敲”的机械化生产流水线。云南毛巾厂也是如此。今年为了适应市场的需要，他们“不等不靠，大家动手造”，终于在半年内制造出了全铁毛巾机、宽幅机、经纱机和烫平机等一百一十台。工厂完全换上了新装，产品的品种、质量都有显著的增加和提高，现在和半年以前相比，确乎是面貌一新了。
    “穷棒子”精神不仅表现在生产上的革新技术、自制设备等等方面，而且不少企业由于生产不断发展的需要，基本建设又排不上队的情况下，还自己动手大建厂房。仅据全市机电、化工、轻工三个工业局的初步统计，今年以来自建工程达三万多平方米，其中如昆明虫胶厂、安宁化工厂都是在一无投资、二无建筑力量、三无建筑材料的情况下，自己动手，烧砖瓦、采石料，利用篾席棚、旧木条，分别建成了总计约八千平方米的厂房，解决了生产场地不足的困难。现在，对于昆明市的许多企业来说，“没有厂房自己建，没有设备自己造，没有材料自己找，没有技术自己学”已经不只是一句口号，而是广大职工群众的实际行动了。
    这几年来，在生产建设的实践中，我们一直紧紧抓住“穷棒子”精神，大宣传，大提倡，大发扬，经常应用对比的方法，树立鲜明的对立面以教育提高干部、群众，因而使人们的精神面貌也起了很大变化。许多人深刻地体会到：“自己动手，轰轰烈烈；等米下锅，冷冷清清”，“‘自’字当头，气象万千；‘等’字当头，寸步难行”。同时，通过实践也进一步懂得了：在我们的建设事业中，始终依靠和坚持发扬“穷棒子”精神，这既不是一个简单的方法问题，也不是一时权宜之计，而是整个社会主义建设过程中一个根本性的方针。这种精神，不仅过去干革命需要，现在和将来进行建设也同样需要；不仅穷厂、小厂需要，大厂、现代化的工厂也同样需要；不只是办工厂“起家”的时候需要，进一步提高和向工业现代化进军也同样需要；不只是在工农业生产建设上需要，在其他各项建设事业中也同样需要。事实上，全市在文教、财贸等部门都同样出现了不少依靠“穷棒子”精神“兴家立业”的单位和事例。
      “穷棒子”精神，这是雄心壮志、敢想敢干、自己动手、发愤图强这些特点的形象性的概括。毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书的按语中讲到，只有三条驴腿的“穷棒子社”——王国藩领导的农业社，“他们用自己的努力，在三年时间内，‘从山上取来’了大批的生产资料，使得有些参观的人感动得下泪”，并指出：“这就是我们整个国家的形象。”昆明市的工业战线上正是由于出现了不少这样的“形象”，才有力地推动着我们的建设事业一日千里地向前发展。“穷棒子”精神，也是一种对待困难的大无畏精神的表现。在我们的建设事业中，总会经常遇到这样或那样的困难。我国是一个人口众多，在经济上和科学技术上又十分落后的大国，要进行史无前例的、伟大的建设，没有困难是不可设想的。但是，我们从来没有被困难吓倒，也决不会在任何困难面前低头。因为我们遇到的困难，是前进中的困难，是发展中的困难，是暂时性的困难，这种困难本身就包含着可以被克服的因素。毛主席在《迎接中国革命的新高潮》一文中指出：“反动势力面前和我们面前都有困难。但是反动势力的困难是不可能克服的，因为他们是接近于死亡的没有前途的势力。我们的困难是能够克服的，因为我们是新兴的有光明前途的势力。”因此，我们遵循着这一真理，对待生产建设中的任何困难，也和对待阶级敌人一样，总是在战略上、在整体上藐视它，同时在战术上、在具体工作安排上又要重视它，切实地解决工作中的每一个困难。今年以来，昆明市有许多企业，在生产建设持续跃进过程中，也曾经遇到过若干大大小小的困难，但是，他们继续发扬了“穷棒子”精神，大破难关，取得了显著成就。昆明风动工具厂在这方面又给我们树立了一个良好的榜样。这个厂，今年要实现产品产量大革命，在工作中碰到不少困难。根据这个情况，厂的党组织总结了几年来和困难作斗争的经验，提出一不等（碰到困难不等待别人帮助），二不让（解决困难当仁不让），三商量（有困难和群众商量），四支持（满腔热情支持各种克服困难的创议），五出题（还要经常给自己出难题）的口号，充分调动了广大职工群众的积极性。他们还把有计划地进行技术改造和广泛开展群众性的“四小”运动（小革新、小窍门、小改进、小创造）相结合，不断地解决矛盾，战胜困难，因而能在职工减少三分之一的情况下，又取得了提前超额完成比去年同期增长四点八倍的全年产品产量计划的重大胜利。
    和“穷棒子”精神相对立的是自卑感、“唯条件论”、伸手派，以及那种“拖拖沓沓，困难重重，这也不可能，那也办不到”的懦夫和懒汉的世界观。在“自”字和“等”字的关系上，他们不是“自”字当头，缺乏那种“从山上取来”的志气，而是“等”字当头，总是仰望外边支援，上边帮助。在土和洋的关系上，他们不是坚持土洋并举，而是土的看不起，洋的又搞不成，只好望“洋”兴叹。在人和物的关系上，他们总是见物不见人，死啃“条件”，强调客观困难，而看不到人的主观能动作用。有些工厂企业，虽然和别的单位具备同样的物质技术条件，甚至比别的单位条件更好，但由于精神状态不对头，在生产建设和技术革命中取得的成就却悬殊很大。昆明就有这样两个水泥厂，一个是拥有全套新式设备的现代化企业，技术和机修力量也相当强，但是对于本厂生产上的薄弱环节，一直是等待国家安排基本建设项目，自己不肯动手；在技术革命中虽然也进行了某些改造，但在转入巩固、提高阶段以后，许多革新项目又都处于拆（拆掉）、摆（摆着不用）、拖（拖着不搞）的境地，企业面貌“依然故我”，生产增长很慢。而另外一个半土半洋的小厂子，虽然技术和设备条件都比较差，却敢于和条件比自己好得多的单位比赛。他们针对生产关键大搞技术改造，仅仅半年时间就从采掘、运输、粉碎、烧成等所有工序基本实现了机械化，和去年同期比较生产有很大增长。这两个厂在生产和技术革命上所以有如此巨大的不同，最主要的无非是在思想上不“一个样”，他们一个是“从山上取来”，一个却是希望“等来”。“取”“等”之间，这反映了两种完全不同的精神状态，精神状态不同，得出相反的两种结果。因此，要发扬“穷棒子”精神，就必须大反自卑感、“唯条件论”、伸手派，大破懦夫和懒汉的世界观。不破不立，不破除这些东西，就不可能坚持“穷棒子”精神，迅速发展社会主义建设事业。
    为什么我们在建设事业中要提倡这种“穷棒子”精神？为什么一提倡就能在政治上、经济上发生这样显著的作用？从客观上讲，是因为我们穷，正如毛主席指出的：“中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白”“穷则思变，要干，要革命”。从主观上说，“穷棒子”精神正是反映了人们要求迅速改变“一穷二白”面貌的强烈愿望。更重要的是，“穷棒子”精神是无产阶级的阶级意识，是马克思列宁主义的世界观所决定的。无产阶级肩负根绝一切剥削制度的历史使命，有建设共产主义的远大理想，对于自己所从事的革命事业，抱着坚定不移的胜利信心。因此，他们具有雄心壮志，敢想敢干，不怕任何艰难险阻，永远保持着旺盛的革命热情和高度的革命乐观主义精神。他们坚信“自己解放自己”的真理，懂得“人民群众自己的解放，只有人民群众自己起来斗争，自己起来争取，才能获得，才能保持与巩固；而不是任何群众之外的人所能恩赐、所能给予的，也不是任何群众之外的人能够代替群众去争取的。”（刘少奇：《论党》）因此，不论在革命和建设事业中，我们从来总是强调依靠自己的力量，埋头苦干，发愤图强，而决不单纯地依赖和等待。也只有这样，才能把一切积极因素充分地调动起来，使广大群众在生产建设中有用武之地。我们强调自己动手与发扬
  “穷棒子”精神，这是和贯彻党的群众路线紧密联系在一起的。
  “穷棒子”精神也是我党的一种优良的光荣传统。过去闹革命、搞武装斗争，许多地方都是从“一把菜刀起家”“两条半破枪打江山”发展起来的。在抗日战争最艰苦的年代，解放区人民响应了毛主席“自己动手”“丰衣足食”的伟大号召，开展了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动，终于战胜了由于国民党反动派包围封锁造成的经济上的严重困难。在解放战争时期，我们曾经用“小米加步枪”，打败了全部美式装备的国民党反动军队。现在，我们提倡依靠“穷棒子”精神进行建设，正是对我党这种优良传统的继承和发扬。
    发扬“穷棒子”精神在实际工作中所能起的作用，已为两年多来的实践所证明。但是，为什么在这以前这种精神就没有能像现在这样充分得到发扬，在生产建设事业中发生这样明显的作用呢？固然，这是需要经过一个认识和实践的过程，但更重要的是党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套“两条腿走路”方针的提出，和学习毛主席著作的群众运动的深入开展。可以这样说，如果没有用总路线和毛泽东思想武装了人们的头脑，“穷棒子”精神就不可能在建设事业中发挥出这样巨大的威力。总路线帮助人们破除了迷信，打掉了自卑感，解除了精神上的重重束缚，这就给“穷棒子”精神的发扬提供了最大限度的可能性。毛泽东思想，正如许多人这样形象地称呼它，是一把“万能的金钥匙”，有了这把“钥匙”，才能使人们的思想“开窍”，才能把群众中蕴藏着的无穷无尽的智慧和力量的宝库打开，把群众的积极性最充分地调动起来。昆明市有许多“穷棒子”企业，在“创业”及发展的过程中，也正像昆明风动工具厂一样，曾经碰到过不少困难，有人向他们吹过冷风，但是由于从毛主席著作中汲取了力量，终于能够战胜困难，顶住冷风，取得胜利。许多干部都有这样的体会：“干劲不足查思想，思想不通就辩论，没有办法找群众，方向不明学理论”，许多难于解决的问题，都从毛主席著作中找到了答案。
    “穷棒子”精神，这是我们时代的一种可贵的风格。通过这几年来党的教育和生产建设的实践，这种精神在广大干部和群众的思想上已经生了根。现在正当我们在总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗的指引下，轰轰烈烈地开展以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动，保证我们各项建设事业持续跃进的时候，进一步地发扬“穷棒子”精神，发扬我们党的艰苦奋斗、脚踏实地、埋头苦干、发愤图强的优良的革命传统，无疑是具有更加重要的意义的。
