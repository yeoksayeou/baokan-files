    Major E. Che Guevara, Head of the Cuban National Bank and the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation, gave a speech at the welcome banquet.

    Comrades representing the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China, friends from Latin American countries and all countries of the world present here,

    Premier Zhou Enlai, in his welcome speech just now, not only outlined the international situation, but also made brilliant remarks on the common problems and mutual friendship between our two peoples. However, Mr. Premier forgot to mention the deep gratitude of the Cuban people towards the great Chinese people. This gratitude is beyond words and has been developing for a long time. As early as in our national liberation struggle, we took the Chinese people and the people of socialist countries as our example. We have always maintained this gratitude because the Chinese people, with their twenty-two years of struggle, have given us great experience. The worker-peasant alliance in China, under backward rural conditions similar to those in our American countries, has pointed out a new path for the Americas. After liberation, we still maintained this gratitude, because under the obvious danger of American aggression, the Chinese people rose up to fight to defend our freedom, standing in the ranks of defending our newly born revolutionary pioneer country.

    The friendship, understanding, respect, and admiration that our people have today for the Chinese people have been gradually developed over many years through long and difficult times because, in those years, imperialist propaganda blocked the sources of information and blinded the people of our American countries. However, no matter how eloquent they are, no matter how many times they repeat the same rhetoric among the oppressed peoples of various countries, they can never hide the facts. The fact is that when we faced aggression by others, the socialist countries extended a hand of friendship to us, giving us what was necessary to maintain our economy and the necessary guarantees to defend our country in the event of imperialist aggression.

    Two months ago, the entire Cuban people held a national congress and unanimously adopted the Havana Declaration. The entire Cuban people unanimously agreed to immediately sever all relations with the Chiang Kai-shek puppet clique and immediately establish diplomatic and all relations with the People's Republic of China. At that time, when our Premier sought opinions, one million people in Havana's Civic Square raised their hands and unanimously agreed to immediately establish various relations with the People's Republic of China.

    Now we come to China, bringing the respect, admiration, and gratitude of our people.

    Therefore, we agree with Premier Zhou's suggestion just now to toast the freedom of the people of all countries and world peace. At the same time, I propose a toast to the health of Premier Zhou Enlai, to the health of Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong!

    在周总理举行的欢迎宴会上
    格瓦拉少校的讲话
    新华社18日讯　古巴国家银行行长、古巴革命政府经济代表团团长埃·切·格瓦拉少校在欢迎宴会上的讲话。代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府的同志们在座的拉丁美洲各国和世界各国的朋友们
    周恩来总理刚才在致欢迎词中，不仅概述了国际局势，而且就我们两国人民之间共同的问题和相互的友谊作了精辟的论述。但是总理先生忘了谈到古巴人民对伟大的中国人民的深切的感激心情。这种感激心情是言语难以形容的，它的产生已非一日，早在我们的民族解放斗争中，我们就以中国人民和社会主义各国的人民为榜样。我们一直保持这种感激的心情，因为中国人民以他们二十二年的斗争给了我们伟大的经验，中国在类似我们美洲各国的落后的农村条件下的工农联盟给我们指出了美洲的新道路。在解放之后我们仍然保持着这种感激的心情，因为在美国明显的侵略危险下，中国人民起来为保卫我们的自由而斗争，站在保卫我们新生的革命的先锋国家的行列。
    我国人民今天对中国人民的友情、了解、尊敬和钦佩，是多年来长期而困难地逐渐发展起来的，因为在那些年代里，帝国主义的宣传封锁了消息来源，蒙蔽了我们美洲各国人民。然而不论他们如何花言巧语，不论他们如何在各国被压迫人民中一遍又一遍地重复同样的论调，他们却绝不能掩盖事实。事实是，当我们面临被别人侵略时，社会主义国家向我们伸出了友谊之手，给予我们维持我们的经济所必要的东西，和在帝国主义发动侵略的情况下维护我们的国家所必要的保证。
    两个月以前，古巴全体人民举行全国大会，一致通过了哈瓦那宣言。古巴全体人民一致同意立即同蒋介石傀儡集团断绝一切关系，并立即同中华人民共和国建立外交关系和一切关系。当时，我们的总理征询意见时，哈瓦那西维卡广场上的一百万人举起手来，一致同意立即同中华人民共和国建立各种关系。
    现在我们来到中国，带来了我国人民的敬意、钦佩和感谢。
    因此，我们同意周总理刚才所建议的为各国人民的自由、为世界和平而干杯，同时，我建议为周恩来总理的健康，为刘少奇主席的健康，为毛泽东主席的健康，干杯。
