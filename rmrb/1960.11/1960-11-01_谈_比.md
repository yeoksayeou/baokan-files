    On "Comparing"
    Zheng Yaozhong, Worker at Shanghai No. 101 Factory

    Dialectical materialism tells us that the development of things always proceeds from imbalance to balance, and then from balance to imbalance; and that balance is temporary and relative, while imbalance is constant and absolute. This is the objective law of the development of things. Because of this, in the process of the development of things, there are differences of fast and slow, good and bad, advanced and backward. Only by fully promoting the advanced to overcome the backward can society progress. Today, we are carrying out the "Five Comparisons" competition in order to fully promote the advanced, drive the backward, and continuously promote the development of productive forces.

    Cao Guanfu, a sewing worker in our factory, has processed 750,000 pieces of clothing in seven years, with only one second-class product. However, in the shirt group of our workshop, each person had an average of 44 rejected products in the first eight months of this year. If we also calculate it over seven years, that would be an average of 462 rejected products per person. Comparing this with Comrade Cao Guanfu's record of no rejected products in seven years, it's truly "you don't know until you compare, and you're shocked when you compare." However, what happens after being "shocked"? Everyone's attitude is not entirely the same, and the results are also different. Some people, after being "shocked," are intimidated, thinking that they are backward anyway and there is no way to improve. Subjectively, they do not seek to progress, and as a result, they become more and more backward. There are also some comrades who are different from this. They dare to admit backwardness, but they are unwilling to lag behind. Therefore, they carefully analyze the reasons for their backwardness, both humbly learn from the advanced, have the ambition to catch up with the advanced, and have concrete measures to put in place. After hard work, they finally "jump" up from the "shock," catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced. Comrade Xu Siyan of the Sixteenth Group in our factory used to make only 230 waistbands per day. Before the "Five Comparisons," he could make 460, doubling his output. At this time, he was satisfied. However, through this competition, he discovered that Comrade Lu Quanfu of the Eighteenth Group could make 660 a day, exceeding his own by 200. "You don't know until you compare, and you're shocked when you compare." So, he went to learn from the advanced, humbly learned from them, and made every effort to catch up. Finally, he caught up with the advanced level in three days. From this, we can see that through "comparison," everyone can see the advanced, find objects to learn from, and fully unleash everyone's enthusiasm and creativity.

    For the backward, there is the issue of catching up with and surpassing the advanced; for the advanced, there is also the issue of becoming even more advanced. The advanced is relative. What is advanced today may not be advanced tomorrow if there is no spirit of continuous revolution, complacency, and no desire for progress. The upstream has no end, and being advanced does not stop there. But people can also have two different attitudes towards being advanced: one is to stop after a little taste, and be complacent and satisfied after achieving a little success (which can be said to be great at the time). As a result, they cannot see the situation of "there are benchmarks ahead and pursuers behind." In this way, they slowly fall behind. Another attitude is to never be satisfied with one's achievements, to demand that oneself be better and better, more advanced and more advanced, and to continuously strive for the upstream. When others catch up with oneself, one can humbly learn from others to move oneself forward. Therefore, in the "Five Comparisons" competition, we must not only dare to compare, be brave to admit backwardness, and be brave to catch up with the advanced, but also promote the spirit of continuous comparison and continuous striving for the upstream. Only in this way can we form a situation in the competition where you chase me, the backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become even more advanced, thereby continuously improving the level of production.

    谈“比”
    上海一○一厂工人　郑耀忠
    辩证唯物主义告诉我们：事物的发展总是由不平衡到平衡，再由平衡到不平衡；而平衡是暂时的相对的，不平衡是经常的绝对的。这是事物发展的客观规律。由于这样，在事物发展的过程中，就存在着快与慢、好与差、先进与落后的差别。只有充分地发扬先进的东西去克服落后的东西，才能使社会前进。今天我们开展“五比”竞赛，就是为了充分发扬先进，带动后进，不断推动生产力的向前发展。
    我厂缝纫工曹关福，七年中加工了七十五万件衣服，只出一件二等品，而我所在的车间的衬衣小组，在今年的头八个月中，每人平均就有四十四件退修品。假使也以七年计算的话，那就是每人平均退修四百六十二件，与曹关福同志七年中没有一件退修的情况一比，真是“不比不知道，一比吓一跳”。但是，在“吓一跳”之后怎样呢？各人所抱的态度是不尽相同的，结果也不一样。有的人“吓一跳”以后，就被吓住了，认为反正落后了，没有办法，主观上不图上进，结果愈来愈落后。还有一些同志，与此不同，他们敢于承认落后，但不甘落后，因此，便认真分析自己的落后原因，既虚心向先进学习，有赶上先进的雄心壮志，又有踏踏实实的具体措施，这样经过刻苦努力，终于一“吓”而“跳”上去，赶上先进，超过先进。我厂十六小组徐四眼同志，以前做腰绊每天只做二百三十条，在“五比”前已能做四百六十条，产量提高了一倍，这时他就心满意足了。可是通过这次竞赛，发现十八小组陆全福同志每天可做六百六十条，超过自己二百条。“不比不知道，一比吓一跳”，于是他就上门拜师，虚心向先进学习，全力追赶，终于在三天内赶上了先进水平。由此可见，通过“比”，就能使大家看到先进，找到学习的对象，就能把大家的积极性、创造性充分地发挥出来。
    对于落后来说，存在一个赶先进、超先进的问题；对于先进来说，也同样存在一个先进更先进的问题。先进是相对的，今天是先进的，如果没有不断革命的精神，安于现状，不求进取，明天就不一定是先进了。上游无止境，先进也并非到此为止。但人们对待先进，也可以有两种不同的态度：一种是浅尝辄止，取得一点成绩（在当时也可以说是很大的），便沾沾自喜，自满起来，结果就看不见“前面还有标兵，后面还有追兵”的形势，这样，慢慢地就落后了。另一种态度是永不满足于自己的成就，要求自己好了还要好，先进更先进，不断地争上游，当别人赶上自己时，又能虚心向别人学习，使自己再前进一步。所以，在“五比”竞赛中，我们不仅要敢于比，勇于承认落后，勇于追赶先进，还要发扬不断比、不断争上游的精神，这样才能在竞赛中形成你追我赶，落后赶先进，先进更先进的形势，从而不断提高生产水平。
