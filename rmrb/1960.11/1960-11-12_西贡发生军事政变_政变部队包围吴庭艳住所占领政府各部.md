Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 11th: Saigon Dispatch: According to a Saigon radio report cited by the Vietnam News Agency, a military coup occurred in Saigon at 3:00 AM on November 11th. Coup troops surrounded Ngo Dinh Diem's residence, "Independence Palace," and some agencies belonging to the puppet "Presidential Palace."

Preliminary reports indicate that communication between "Independence Palace" and the outside world has been cut off. Ngo Dinh Diem's remaining forces had to hastily request troop reinforcements from My Tho Province, southwest of Saigon, via radio in order to lift the siege.

According to the Associated Press, the coup was launched by four paratrooper battalions responsible for maintaining Saigon's security, led by Colonel Nguyen Chanh Thi. Agence France-Presse reported that the 7th Division stationed in Saigon, along with some police and military police, also participated in the coup.

Reports indicate heavy gunfire during the attack on the "Presidential Palace," with fifteen paratroopers killed. Gunfire could still be heard in downtown Saigon at 12:20 PM.

    政变部队包围吴庭艳住所占领政府各部
    新华社河内11日电　西贡消息：据越南通讯社援引西贡电台消息报道，11月11日晨三时在西贡发生军事政变。政变军队包围了吴庭艳住所“独立宫”和隶属于伪“总统府”的一部分机关。
    据初步消息表明，目前“独立宫”和外界的联系已经中断。吴庭艳的残余势力不得不慌忙通过电台向西贡西南的美萩省调兵求援，以便解围。
    另据美联社报道，发动政变的是负责维持西贡治安的四个伞兵营，政变由阮正诗上校领导。据法新社报道说，驻在西贡的第七师部队和一部分警察、宪兵也参加了政变。
    据报道，在进攻“总统府”时有密集的枪声，有十五名伞兵被打死。直到中午十二时二十分，在西贡市中心还可听到枪声。
