To implement the "Three-Thirds System" of leadership method is not merely about sending more cadres down to the grassroots to participate in and lead production, but more importantly, to strengthen the Party's grassroots leadership, further implement the Party's policies, and mobilize the greater enthusiasm of the masses. In particular, we must first send a group of cadres to stay and work in weak grassroots units, strengthen the leadership there, help them do their work well, and completely change their outlook. At the same time, we must greatly strengthen grassroots inspection work, combining cursory observation with in-depth investigation and research, so as to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, exchange experiences in grassroots work; and also help leading organs grasp the situation at the lower levels and provide specific guidance to the grassroots. After a large number of cadres from leading organs go down, daily affairs will be reduced, which will facilitate concentrating efforts to do a good job in central tasks and improve work efficiency. In short, implementing the "Three-Thirds System" of leadership method is of great significance for improving leadership style, strengthening leadership of grassroots work, and strengthening specific guidance to the grassroots.

The "Three-Thirds System" of leadership method is a new thing, and it is impossible for everyone to recognize and master it all at once. Some people believe that after these years of sending cadres to work and train at the lower levels, the cadres' political and ideological level has been improved, and it is not necessary to stay and work for a year in implementing the "Three-Thirds System" of leadership method, except for continuing labor training. These people do not realize that the "Three-Thirds System" of leadership method that we are now implementing is not the same thing as long-term labor training for cadres. They have things in common, but also things that are different. The main purpose of sending cadres to work for long-term labor training is to improve the cadres' level of awareness and completely change their world view through labor training, while also strengthening grassroots work; the fundamental purpose of sending cadres to stay and work at the lower levels for a long time is to strengthen grassroots work, better implement the Party's policies, and further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, while also improving the ideological style of cadres through labor training. Therefore, we cannot think that the "Three-Thirds System" of leadership method is unnecessary just because a very small number of comrades have participated in labor training. Some people think that streamlining the organizational structure and reducing the number of cadres means that we cannot spare people to implement the "Three-Thirds System" of leadership method, which will affect the development of the work of the organs. We should see that after two-thirds of the cadres go down, the daily affairs of the organs will definitely be greatly reduced, and at the same time, meetings, official documents, and reports will also be greatly reduced. Even if the things that need to be done are still the same, this is a great opportunity to train and improve cadres. In the case of fewer people and more things, it can prompt us to improve our working methods, improve work efficiency, truly achieve fewer people doing more things, doing good things, and doing a good job in the work of the organs. At the same time, since two-thirds of the cadres are often at the grassroots level, going deep into reality and deep into the masses, discovering problems, and solving problems, it is conducive to combining inspection work, investigation and research, and summing up and promoting experience, and actually doing the work that the organs do at the grassroots level. Some comrades are afraid of the hardship and heavy work at the grassroots level and are unwilling to go down. It should be admitted that grassroots work is more difficult and heavier than organ work, but as long as we have full political enthusiasm and a high sense of responsibility for the Party's cause, and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work in the Yan'an period, we will certainly be able to withstand the test of the harsh environment. Facts have proved that the more difficult it is, the easier it is to improve our work ability and political awareness.

Now, a large number of cadres will be going down to stay and work one after another. We put forward the following specific requirements for the cadres at all levels who go down: First, they must resolutely obey the leadership of the local Party committee and model themselves on observing the Party's discipline; act as good advisers, offer ideas, and find ways to help grassroots cadres do their work well, and do not take over and do everything for them. Second, they must carry forward the fine tradition of close ties with the masses and seeking truth from facts, go deep among the masses, adhere to the "four togethers," and eat, live, work, and discuss with the masses. Third, they must attach importance to and strengthen investigation and research, sum up experience, pay attention to cultivating new things, and sum up and promote them in a timely manner. Fourth, and most importantly, they must continue to work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and study the Party's policies.

The situation is constantly changing, and the construction cause is changing with each passing day. Conscientiously implementing the "Three-Thirds System" of leadership method will enable us to further improve our work style, do our work more meticulously and solidly, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, and have the whole Party and the whole people engage in agriculture in a big way, striving to make next year's grain harvest exceed any year, and on this basis, promote the continued leap forward of the national economy.

    坚决实行“三三制”的领导方法
    陕西日报社论摘要
    贯彻执行“三三制”领导方法，不仅仅是多派一些干部下到基层，参加生产与领导生产，更重要的是加强党的基层领导，进一步贯彻执行党的方针政策，调动广大群众更大的积极性。特别是首先要派一批干部到薄弱的基层单位蹲点，加强那里的领导，帮助做好工作，彻底改变面貌。同时，大大加强基层的巡回检查工作，使走马观花和下马观花结合起来，深入调查研究，这样既有助于及时发现问题和解决问题，交流基层工作经验；又有助于领导机关掌握下情，对基层进行具体指导。领导机关大批干部下去后，日常事务减少，便于集中力量搞好中心工作，提高工作效率。总之，贯彻执行“三三制”领导方法，对于改进领导作风、加强基层工作领导、加强对基层的具体指导，都有着十分重要的意义。
      “三三制”的领导方法是一个新事物，不可能一下子就被所有的人所认识，所掌握。有人认为，经过这几年的下放干部劳动锻炼，干部的政治思想水平提高了，实行“三三制”领导方法，除掉继续劳动锻炼以外，蹲点一年没有必要。这些人没有认识到，现在我们要实行的“三三制”领导方法，和长期下放劳动锻炼，并不是一回事。它们有相同的地方，也有不同的地方。下放干部长期劳动锻炼的主要目的在于经过劳动锻炼，提高干部的觉悟程度，彻底改变世界观，同时也加强了基层工作；下放干部长期蹲点的根本目的在于加强基层工作，更好地贯彻党的政策，进一步调动广大群众的积极性，同时也通过劳动锻炼改进干部思想作风。所以，不能因为极少数同志参加了劳动锻炼，而认为“三三制”的领导方法就不必要了。有些人认为精简机构，干部减少了，再实行“三三制”领导方法，抽不出人来，会影响机关工作的开展。我们应该看到：三分之二的干部下去后，机关的日常事务一定会大大减少，同时会议、公文表报也会大量减少。即使应办的事情还是那样多，这正是锻炼提高干部的大好机会。在人少事多的情况下，可以促使我们改进工作方法，提高工作效率，真正做到人少多办事、办好事，把机关工作做好。同时，由于经常有三分之二的干部在基层，深入实际，深入群众，发现问题，解决问题，就有利于把检查工作，调查研究，总结推广经验等结合起来，实际上就在基层做了机关所做的工作。有些同志怕基层艰苦、工作繁重，不愿下去。应当承认，基层工作比起机关工作来，是要艰苦、繁重些，但只要我们有饱满的政治热情，对党的事业有高度的责任感，发扬延安时期艰苦奋斗的优良传统，就一定能够经得起艰苦环境的考验。事实证明：越是艰苦，越容易提高我们的工作能力和政治觉悟。
    现在，大批干部将陆续下去蹲点。我们对下去的各级干部提出以下几点具体要求：第一，必须坚决服从当地党委的领导，模范地遵守党的纪律；当好参谋，出主意，想办法，帮助基层干部搞好工作，不要包办代替。第二，必须发扬密切联系群众、实事求是的优良传统，深入群众，坚持“四同”，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量。第三，必须重视和加强调查研究，总结经验，注意培养新鲜事物，及时总结推广。第四，最重要的是必须继续努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，学习党的方针政策。
    情况在不断变化，建设事业日新月异，认真贯彻执行“三三制”领导方法，就会使我们进一步改进工作作风，把工作做得越细致，越扎实，把广大群众的积极性充分调动起来，全党全民大办农业，力争明年粮食收成超过任何一年，并在此基础上促进国民经济的继续跃进。
