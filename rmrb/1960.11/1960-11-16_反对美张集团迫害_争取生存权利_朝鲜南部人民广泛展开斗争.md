Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th: According to reports in the newspapers here, the struggle of the people of South Korea from all walks of life, led by the working class, against the various persecutions of the US-Chang Group authorities and for the right to exist, continues to develop in various parts of the South.

    On October 29, South Korean railway workers strongly protested against the puppet authorities' high-handed measures of collective dismissal of railway workers who demanded wage increases. They submitted a letter of protest to the puppet Ministry of Transportation, resolutely demanding that such illegal dismissal of workers be stopped immediately and that their jobs be restored.

    On October 21, South Korean railway workers put forward demands such as doubling wages and shortening the working hours of train drivers and stokers, and announced that they would take action if the puppet authorities did not accept the demands within six weeks. The panic-stricken puppet authorities not only did not agree to the workers' legitimate demands, but also dismissed thirty workers at once on October 28.

    On November 4, the workers of the "Daehan Ceramics Company" in Busan held a demonstration to fight for the victory of the strike that had been going on since September 28. About 370 workers, holding banners and slogans, rushed to the Gyeongsangnam-do "Provincial Hall," which sheltered the enterprise owners and carried out cruel exploitation, and held a sit-in in the "Provincial Hall" square, demanding direct talks with the puppet "Provincial Governor" and clarifying the attitude of the pseudo-provincial authorities towards the illegal acts of the enterprise owners.

    On November 3, all workers in the South Korean postal and telecommunications departments put forward a demand for a 50% wage increase, and the workers also organized a wage increase struggle committee.

    The Chang Myon Group is preparing to greatly increase electricity prices from January next year and "reform" the tax system, intensifying the plunder of the people. This has aroused strong opposition from the people of southern Korea. The South Korean authorities decided to maintain the original electricity prices for "military," "official" and power purposes, while increasing the electricity prices for civilian use by 85% at once.

    More than 300 farmers in Jeollabuk-do, belonging to the "Jeonbuk Irrigation Association," marched to the office of the "Association" on October 14, holding banners with the slogan "Reduce the water tax for one sakae-bo (approximately 1.5 acres) to 1,500 hwan." Under the instigation of the Chang Myon Group, many local "irrigation associations" plundered 12,000 to 13,000 hwan from the "water tax" of one sakae-bo of paddy field.

    Recently, small and medium-sized merchants in southern Korea opposed the Chang Myon Group's measures to restrict their trade under the instructions of US imperialism. In their letter of protest to the puppet Ministry of Commerce and Industry, they expressed their dissatisfaction with the methods of restricting small and medium-sized merchants by using "handling fees" and "collateral materials."

    Parents of elementary school students in Seoul stubbornly refused to purchase the "education bonds" forcibly issued by the authorities. According to reports, the Seoul "Education Committee" forced the parents of elementary school students to purchase 832.5 million hwan worth of "education bonds," but the parents did not buy them. The puppet authorities only forcibly sold 13%, and the rest had to be burned.
