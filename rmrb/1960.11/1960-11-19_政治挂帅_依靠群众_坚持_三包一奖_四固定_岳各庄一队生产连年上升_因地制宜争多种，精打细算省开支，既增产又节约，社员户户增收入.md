    Put Politics in Command, Rely on the Masses, Adhere to the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" and "Four Fixes"
    Yuegezhuang No. 1 Team's Production Increases Year After Year
    Adapt to Local Conditions to Strive for Variety, Practice Careful Calculation to Save Expenses, Increasing Production and Practicing Economy, Allowing Commune Members to Increase Income
    (Our Dispatch) The Yuegezhuang Production Brigade's No. 1 Production Team of the Lugouqiao People's Commune in Fengtai District, Beijing, persists in putting politics in command, conscientiously implements the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, and ensures that production and income increase year after year.
    This team mainly produces vegetables. From the time of the advanced agricultural producers' cooperative to the five years after the people's commune, it has consistently adhered to the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, fully mobilizing the production enthusiasm of the commune members, and the value and output of production have increased year after year, overfulfilling the production plan every year. Especially in the two years after the communization, the pace of the Great Leap Forward has been even greater. In 1959, they overfulfilled the production target by 18% and saved more than 2,400 yuan in expenses. This year, from January to October, the output value has already exceeded the actual output value of the entire year of last year by 13%, and the amount of vegetables on the market has increased by more than 10,000 catties compared with the actual amount on the market for the entire year last year.
    This production team, in implementing the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" system, mainly grasped the following links.
    1. In guaranteeing output, grasp the arrangement and implementation of the production plan, paying attention to doing a good job in sowing in accordance with local conditions and the seasons, and doing everything possible to increase the number of crop rotations to improve land utilization. This spring, this team planted more than nine mu of small red radishes and planted corn on the ridges. According to the original plan, after the small red radishes were harvested, no more crops would be planted, and large Chinese cabbages would be planted after the corn was harvested. However, when they were arranging the crop rotation, they found that they could increase the number of rotations. After the small red radishes were harvested, they rushed to plant a crop of fennel, and after the fennel was harvested, they rushed to plant a crop of pickled mustard greens. Due to careful management, these two crops yielded more than 48,000 catties; at the same time, it did not affect the yield of corn and the timely planting of large Chinese cabbages.
    2. In guaranteeing work, grasp the improvement of labor efficiency and the rational organization and use of labor. According to the distance of the land, the layout of the crops, and the strength of the labor force, the entire team is divided into three work groups, and each work group has a fixed work area. The production and management measures of the group and the use of labor are all discussed and implemented by the work group leader in conjunction with the commune members. The production captain and work group leaders make small arrangements for work every five days, and check the production situation every day, and solve problems as soon as they are discovered. This practice of arranging small sections of work and fixing work areas has strengthened the production responsibility system of the work groups. Therefore, the production team and the work groups, in allocating and using labor, constantly study and analyze the lightness and difficulty of agricultural work, and use the labor where it is most needed, and do the agricultural work in the most labor-saving period. Due to the good organization, arrangement and use of labor, all kinds of agricultural work in this production team are done early and well, saving labor every year.
    3. In guaranteeing costs, grasp careful calculation and thrift. They do not buy what they can do themselves, and do not add items that can be replaced with old ones; and they also pay attention to saving expenses when they should buy or add them. Every autumn, the cadres and commune members work together to collect forage for the livestock to spend the winter. Last year and this year, they collected more than 60,000 catties of forage, saving more than 2,600 yuan in the cost of buying forage. In order to apply sufficient fertilizer to the crops and save fertilizer expenses, they pay special attention to the year-round accumulation of fertilizer. All eight vegetable delivery trucks in the team bring back dirty soil every time they return from the city. Because they pay attention to saving expenses in everything, this team not only overfulfills the production target every year, but also saves expenses.
    The No. 1 Production Team has been able to smoothly implement the management system of "Three Guarantees and One Reward" because it has done the following:
    1. Strengthened political and ideological work and handed over the policies to the masses. In order to educate the commune members to establish the concept of comprehensively completing the three guarantees targets, they advocated that value and output be given equal importance, preventing the simple pursuit of value or output, according to the characteristics of the vegetable area; and advocated that good land and bad land be given equal importance, preventing the phenomenon of being willing to plant good land and unwilling to plant bad land. This spring, eight mu of lettuce were planted, because the planting period was relatively late. When the lettuce of the neighboring team was on the market, the lettuce of this team had not grown sufficiently. Some commune members said to the captain, "Can we rush to the market now that the market price is relatively high?" The captain patiently explained to the commune members, "The Party tells us to grow more vegetables in order to produce more and better vegetables to supply the urban people. We cannot disregard the Party's policy in order to sell a few more yuan. Besides, lettuce is now in the stage of growth. If we put it on the market a few days later, and let the lettuce grow a little more, we can not only increase the output and let the citizens eat more good vegetables, but also increase the income. Isn't this better?" The commune members thought that what the captain said was right, so they continued to strengthen the management of the lettuce. After all the lettuce was harvested, the average yield per mu reached 5,000 catties, which was one and a half times higher than the yield of the neighboring team; although the price per catty was cheaper, the total income was still higher than that of the neighboring team because 3,000 more catties of vegetables were produced per mu.
    2. The good work of the "Three Guarantees" is inseparable from the fact that the brigade (basic accounting unit) insists on implementing the "Four Fixes" of labor, land, animal power, and farm tools. After the communization, except for a small number of laborers who supported the construction of the reservoir, the remaining laborers in the first team were basically not transferred, ensuring agricultural labor. In terms of land, draught animals, and tools, they are also basically stable and can be used fixedly.
    3. Follow the mass line and jointly discuss measures to increase production. In the past few years, this production team has insisted on repeatedly mobilizing the masses to discuss the guaranteed output target in the process of implementing the three guarantees targets, so that the three guarantees targets are fulfilled every year; in the process of implementing the three guarantees, monthly trial calculations are carried out, and the trial calculation results are announced to the commune members, and everyone is mobilized to discuss the next step of production increase measures. Last August, they suffered a severe rain and flood disaster, and some commune members lacked confidence in completing the three guarantees targets. The production captain immediately, together with the brigade cadres, calculated in detail the situation of completing the three guarantees targets in the previous months, and announced the trial calculation results to the masses. The commune members said: "This time we have a bottom line. As long as we do a good job in field management and increase production, we can make up for the losses caused by the flood." As a result, the overproduction last year was more than 22,000 yuan.

    政治挂帅  依靠群众  坚持“三包一奖”“四固定”
    岳各庄一队生产连年上升
    因地制宜争多种，精打细算省开支，既增产又节约，社员户户增收入
    本报讯　北京市丰台区芦沟桥人民公社岳各庄生产大队第一生产队，坚持政治挂帅，认真执行“三包一奖”制度，保证了生产、收入连年增加。
    这个队主要生产蔬菜，从高级农业生产合作社起到人民公社化后的五年以来，一直坚持执行了三包一奖制度，充分调动了社员的生产积极性，产值、产量一年比一年增加，年年超额完成生产计划。特别是公社化以后的两年间，跃进的步子更大。1959年，他们超额18％完成了包产任务，并且节约了开支二千四百多元。今年，1月到10月的产值已经超过去年全年实际产值13％，蔬菜上市量比去年全年实际上市量增加了一万多斤。
    这个生产队，在执行“三包一奖”制度当中，主要抓住了以下几个环节。
    一、在包产中，抓生产计划的安排和执行，既注意因地、因时制宜地做好播种工作，又千方百计增加作物茬次，提高土地利用率。今年春天，这个队播种了九亩多小红萝卜，埂上种了玉米，按原来计划，小红萝卜收获后不再播种，等玉米收获后种大白菜。可是他们在安排茬口的时候，发现还可以增加茬次，在小红萝卜收获后，又赶种了一茬茴香，茴香收获后，又赶种了一茬雪里红。由于精心管理，这两茬菜收获了四万八千多斤；同时也没有影响玉米的产量和大白菜的适时播种。
    二、在包工中，抓提高劳动效率，合理组织使用劳动力。根据土地远近、作物布局、劳力强弱等情况，把全队划分成三个作业小组，每个作业小组有固定的作业区。小组的生产和管理措施以及劳力使用等，都由作业小组长会同社员商订执行。生产队长和作业组长，五天做一次小段活茬安排，并且天天检查生产情况，发现问题，随时解决。这种小段活茬安排和固定作业区的做法，加强了作业小组的生产责任制。因此，生产队和作业组在调配和使用劳动力上，随时研究分析农活的轻重难易，把劳力用在最需要的地方，把农活做在最省工的时期。由于劳力组织安排和使用得好，这个生产队的各项农活做到了一早百早，又快又好，年年都节约了劳力。
    三、在包成本中，抓精打细算，勤俭过日子。能自己动手做的就不买，能以旧代新的物品就不添；该买该添的，也注意节约开支。这个队每年秋季，干部和社员一起动手，为牲畜过冬大打饲草，去年和今年一共打了六万多斤饲草，节省了买饲草的费用二千六百多元。为了给庄稼施足肥料并且节约肥料开支，他们特别抓紧常年积肥工作。全队八辆送菜车，每次从城里返回的时候，都要捎回脏土。由于处处注意节省开支，这个队不仅年年超额完成包产指标，而且节约了开支。
    第一生产队能够顺利执行三包一奖的管理制度，是由于做好了以下几项工作：
    一、加强了政治思想工作，把政策交给群众。为了教育社员确立全面完成三包指标的观念，他们根据菜区的特点，提倡产值、产量并重，防止单纯追求产值或产量；提倡好地、坏地并重，防止愿种好地、不愿种坏地的现象。今年春天播种了八亩莴笋，因为播种期比较晚，当邻队莴笋上市的时候，这个队的莴笋还没有长足、长好，有的社员就对队长说：“能不能趁现在市场价格比较高，咱们也突击上市？”队长耐心地向社员解释说：“党叫我们多种菜，是为了生产又多又好的菜供应城市人民。不能为了多卖几个钱，就不顾党的方针了。再说，莴笋现在正是长个儿的时候，如果晚上市几天，让莴笋再长一长，既能够增加产量，让市民多吃上一些好菜，又能够增加收入，这不是更好吗？”社员认为队长说得对，就继续加强对莴笋的管理。莴笋全部收获以后，平均亩产量达到五千斤，比邻队产量增加了一倍半；虽然每斤的价格便宜了，但是由于每亩地多产了三千斤菜，总收入仍旧比邻队高。
    二、三包工作做得好，是同大队（基本核算单位）坚持执行劳动力、土地、畜力、农具“四固定”分不开的。公社化以后，第一小队的劳力中除小部分支援水库建设以外，其余劳力基本上没有调动，保证了农业用工。在土地、耕畜、工具方面，也基本上是稳定的，能够固定使用。
    三、走好群众路线，共商超产措施。几年来，这个生产队坚持在三包指标落实过程中，深入发动群众反复讨论包产指标，使三包指标年年兑现；在执行三包过程中，做到了月月试算，向社员公布试算结果，发动大家讨论下一步的超产措施。去年8月遭受严重的雨涝灾害，有些社员对完成三包指标缺乏信心，生产队长马上会同大队干部，详细地计算了以前几个月完成三包指标的情况，并向群众公布了试算结果，社员们说：这回心里有底了，只要鼓足劲把田间管理做好，增加产量，就能弥补涝灾损失。结果去年超产二万二千多元。
