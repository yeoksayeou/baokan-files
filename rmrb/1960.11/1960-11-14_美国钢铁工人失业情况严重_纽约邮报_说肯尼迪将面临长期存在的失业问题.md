Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th -- Two dispatches published in the American "Worker's Weekly" today indicate that, under the shadow of the economic crisis, the unemployment situation of American workers is becoming increasingly serious.

    In a Pittsburgh dispatch entitled "Unemployed Steel Workers Plan Hunger March," the "Worker's Weekly" wrote: The US government admits that in this center of the American steel industry, 97,000 workers are unemployed, accounting for 9.7% of the total labor force. It pointed out that in July of this year, the number of steel workers employed in the region had already decreased by 23,000 compared to July of last year. In August and September, more than 10,000 workers were unemployed, including 5,700 basic steel workers. Three thousand six hundred of the six thousand workers at Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corporation have been laid off; only one thousand two hundred of the five thousand workers at New Kensington Steel Corporation are working. The newspaper pointed out that steel monopoly capitalists are replacing workers with new machines. Therefore, even if the steel market barely maintains its current state, the number of unemployed steel workers will continue to increase.

    The newspaper pointed out that hunger is threatening the families of unemployed steel workers. In the first week of October, more than 68,000 people in the region were living on meager unemployment benefits. Two thousand three hundred and seventy-six unemployed workers have exceeded thirty weeks of unemployment and are now ineligible for benefits. In recent weeks, the number of unemployed workers who are ineligible for benefits is expected to increase substantially. Angry unemployed workers are brewing an organization of a "Hunger March on Washington" to protest to the US government.

    In a Cleveland dispatch, the "Worker's Weekly" reported the serious unemployment situation of workers in Ohio. It said that, according to statistics from the Ohio Department of Industrial and Economic Development, about 200,000 of the state's approximately four million workers are unemployed. According to Akron union workers, at least 15% of the workers in the city are unemployed, not including partially unemployed workers.

    The dispatch quoted the head of the Ohio Employment Bureau as saying that, as in the "recession" period of the American economy in 1958, Cleveland area capitalists have now begun to lay off skilled technical workers. The dispatch pointed out that the situation of more than 43,000 unemployed unskilled workers in Cleveland is even more miserable; they are the first to be laid off and it is difficult for them to find work again. The dispatch wrote that Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers union, said on October 29 that by mid-November, the US will have one million new cars unsold. He said that this situation will inevitably hit the steel industry and other industrial sectors, and will cause more workers to lose their jobs.

      The "New York Post" on the 10th also talked about the "gloomy situation" of unemployment in the United States. It wrote: In the United States, "forty-two of the one hundred and forty-nine major labor areas are now classified as 'areas of persistent labor surplus.' This means that in these areas, the unemployed have long accounted for 6% or more of all workers, and there is no hope of improvement. Only a few weeks ago, the Labor Department added five new 'areas of persistent labor surplus': San Diego, California; Birmingham, Alabama; Canton, Ohio; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Muskegon, Michigan."

    This newspaper, which is close to the Democratic Party, wrote: "When President-elect Kennedy takes office in January next year, one of the most pressing problems he will have to deal with immediately will be the long-standing problem of unemployment, because reliable calculations now show that on the day Kennedy enters the White House, there will be nearly five million men and women who are able and willing to work but have no jobs."

    美国钢铁工人失业情况严重
    “纽约邮报”说肯尼迪将面临长期存在的失业问题
    据新华社13日讯　纽约消息：美国“工人周报”今天发表的两篇通讯表明，在经济危机阴影笼罩下，美国工人失业的情况日益严重。
    “工人周报”在一篇题为“失业钢铁工人计划作饥饿进军”的匹兹堡通讯中写道：美国政府承认这个美国钢铁工业的中心地区有九万七千工人失业，失业人数占劳动力总数9.7％。它指出，在今年7月，这个地区就业的钢铁工人已经比去年7月减少了二万三千人。在8、9月间又有一万多工人失业，其中有五千七百人是基本钢铁工人。阿勒根尼—卢德伦钢铁公司的六千工人中有三千六百人被解雇；新肯星顿钢铁公司的五千工人中只有一千二百工人在工作。这家报纸指出，钢铁垄断资本家正在更换新的机器来代替工人。因此，即使钢铁市场勉强维持目前的状况，失业的钢铁工人的数字仍然会继续增加。
    报纸指出，饥饿正威胁着失业钢铁工人的家庭。在10月份的第一周，这个地区靠领少量的失业补助金生活的已有六万八千多人。有二千三百七十六名失业工人因为失业超过三十个星期，现在已领不到补助金。在最近几个星期，领不到补助金的失业工人的数字预计会大量增加。愤怒的失业工人正在酝酿组织一次“向华盛顿的饥饿进军”，以便向美国政府表示抗议。
    “工人周报”在一篇克利夫兰通讯中报道了美国俄亥俄州工人失业的严重情况。它说，据美国工业和经济发展部门的统计，在这个州约四百万工人中有二十万人失业。据阿克伦市工会工作者估计，在这个城市最少有15％的工人失业，部分失业的工人还不算在内。
    通讯引用了俄亥俄州就业局负责人的话指出，像1958年美国经济
  “衰退”时期的情况那样，克利夫兰地区资本家现在已开始解雇熟练的技术工人。通讯指出，克利夫兰四万三千多失业的不熟练工人的状况更惨，他们首先被解雇而且很难再找到工作。通讯写道，美国联合汽车工人工会主席路德10月29日说，到11月中旬，美国将有一百万辆新汽车卖不出去。他说，这种情况必然会打击钢铁工业和其他工业部门，并将使更多工人失业。
      “纽约邮报”10日也谈到美国工人失业的“阴郁情况”。它写道：在美国“一百四十九个主要劳工区中，有四十二个劳工区现在被列为
  ‘长期不景气’。这就是说，在这些地区中，失业者长期来占全体工人的6％或更多，而且也没有什么改善的希望。仅在几星期以前，劳工部增添了五个新的‘长期不景气’地区：加利福尼亚州的第亚哥，亚拉巴马州的伯明翰，俄亥俄州的坎顿，新泽西州的泽西城，密执安州的马斯根基。”
    这家接近民主党的报纸写道：
  “当新当选总统的肯尼迪在明年1月就任的时候，他将不得不立即处理的最紧迫的问题之一将是长期存在的失业问题，因为现在可靠的计算表明，在肯尼迪进入白宫的那一天，将有将近五百万能够并且愿意工作的男女工人没有工作。”
