Local Newspaper Commentary Excerpts:

	A high-quality agricultural implement that meets specifications is economical, durable, easy to use, and has high work efficiency; a low-quality agricultural implement that fails to meet specifications is uneconomical, not durable, cumbersome to use, and has low work efficiency. The former will surely be praised by the commune members, and they will love to use it more and more; the latter will inevitably be subjected to the legitimate criticism of the commune members, and even be rejected and unused. The effect of the former is to facilitate the masses and promote agricultural production; the effect of the latter is to bring trouble to the masses and cause losses to agriculture. Therefore, as the agricultural implement repair and supplement movement deepens, it is very necessary to raise the issue of agricultural implement quality and specifications in a timely manner to draw everyone's attention. If the quality of agricultural implements is not substantially improved, even if they are repaired faster and manufactured more, they will not achieve the practical effect of serving agricultural production, and will cause undue losses to the country. In the work of agricultural implement repair and manufacturing, paying attention to quality and specifications from beginning to end, and providing agriculture with a large number of high-quality agricultural implements, is the true demonstration of being a promoter of greatly developing agriculture and greatly developing grain production.
	To ensure the quality and specifications of repaired and manufactured agricultural implements, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, specific circumstances, and the timing of the season. Based on the characteristic of agricultural production being highly seasonal, investigations and repairs and manufacturing should be carried out in advance, instead of rushing to work temporarily, so as to avoid shoddy work. In addition to adapting to local conditions, specific circumstances, and the timing of the season, within the enterprise, attention should also be paid to assigning repair and manufacturing tasks according to individual strengths. For example, Zhang San has a lot of experience in making hoes, and Li Si is a skilled sickle maker. This group of people is good at making agricultural implements for high-lying land, and that group of people has high craftsmanship in making agricultural implements for river terraces. When assigning the task of repairing and manufacturing agricultural implements, the technical strengths of these people should be taken into consideration. The requirements should be directly put forward by the small team and the commune members, and the repair and manufacturing should be adapted to local conditions, specific circumstances, and the timing of the season, and the manufacturing tasks should be reasonably assigned according to individual strengths.
	In the practice of agricultural implement repair and manufacturing, our predecessors have accumulated considerable experience. For example, in order to ensure the quality of agricultural implements, the saying circulating among the masses is: "Three points of hot work, seven points of cold work," "A hundred taps with the cold hammer, even without steel it can be used," "First steel, second fire, third quenching, fourth grinding." These are all summaries of experience from the long-term production practices of the working people. These experiences must be treated correctly, inherited, reformed, and developed. For example, there is a method of stamping a firemark on the product in the management of agricultural implements, and there is also a method of implementing guaranteed use, guaranteed repair, and guaranteed replacement. These are all good ways to attract the masses to supervise the quality of products, and should also be promoted.

### 要不断提高农具修制质量

专栏：地方报纸评论摘要

    要不断提高农具修制质量
    一件质量规格很好的农具，经济耐久，使用起来轻巧省力，工效又高；一件质量规格低劣的农具，不经济不耐久，使用起来笨重累人，工效又低。前者，一定会受到社员的赞扬，越用越爱用；后者，必然遭到社员的正当批评，甚至厌弃不用。其效果，一个是便利了群众，促进了农业生产；一个是给群众带来麻烦，为农业造成损失。因此，正当农具修理补充运动深入开展的时候，及时提出农具质量规格问题，引起大家注意，就成为十分必要的一件事了。如果不切切实实地提高农具质量，即使修得再快，制得再多，也不能收到为农业生产服务的实际效果，并为国家造成不应有的损失。在农具修制工作中，自始至终注意质量规格，为农业生产提供数量又多质量又好的农具，才算真正做到了大办农业、大办粮食的促进派。
    要保证修制农具的质量规格，必须因地因事因时制宜。根据农业生产季节性强的特点，要提前调查，提前修制，而不要临时赶工，以免粗制滥造。除了因地因事因时制宜以外，在企业内部，也要注意因人制宜地分配修制任务，比如，张三做锄头很有经验，李四打镰刀是个能手，这部分人善制岗地的农具，那部分人做河畈地农具有很高的手艺，在分配修制农具时，就要考虑到这些人的技术特长。应由小队和社员直接提出要求，因地因事因时制宜地修制，因人制宜地合理分配制造任务。
    在农具修制的实践中，前人给我们积累了相当丰富的经验。例如，为了保证农具质量，在群众中流传着：“三分热活，七分冷活”，“冷锤点一百，没钢也用得”，“一钢二火三镪四磨”，这都是劳动人民在长期生产实践中经验的总结。对这些经验必须正确对待，加以继承、改革和发展。再如，在经营农具中有一种在产品上打火印的办法，又有一种实行包用、包修、包换的办法，这都是吸引群众对产品质量进行监督的好办法，也应该加以发扬。
