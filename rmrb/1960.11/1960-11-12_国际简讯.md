    Most Japanese Middle School Graduates Cannot Continue Their Education
    Tokyo Dispatch: This year, due to severe economic difficulties faced by millions of Japanese families, approximately 2.16 million middle school graduates have been forced to give up hope of continuing their education.
    The so-called "low" tuition of the national Tokyo University still requires students to pay more than 6,000 yen per month. This amount far exceeds the affordability of the Japanese working people, as the vast majority of Japanese laborers earn less than 8,000 yen per month.

    Six Thousand Fires in Tokyo This Year
    Tokyo Dispatch: According to the Tokyo Fire Department, as of the 10th of this month, there have been 6,000 fires in Tokyo this year.
    Japanese radio stations say that this year has seen the most fires in Tokyo since the establishment of the Tokyo Fire Department in 1948.
    The Tokyo Fire Department estimates that by the end of this year, the number of fires will increase to 7,000.

    Indonesian Currency Circulation Soars
    Jakarta Dispatch: According to the weekly bulletin of the Bank of Indonesia, which is responsible for issuing currency, the amount of Indonesian currency in circulation has reached 40.094 billion rupiahs as of November 2nd. This figure is more than double the amount of currency in circulation when large-denomination currency devaluation measures were taken on August 25th last year.

    More Than Two Million Refugees in Southern Korea
    Pyongyang Dispatch: According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency on the 9th, more than 40,000 refugees have been displaced by floods in the suburbs of Busan and Gyeongsangnam-do in southern Korea. They have been living in hunger and cold since being hit by a typhoon in August this year.
    According to southern Korean newspapers, more than 2,262,000 people have been affected by floods and droughts in rural areas of southern Korea. The vast majority of them are on the verge of death due to lack of food and clothing.

    Malayan Authorities Conduct Large-Scale Arrests
    Singapore Dispatch: The People's Socialist Front of Malaya issued a statement in Kuala Lumpur on November 6th, protesting against the Rahman government's large-scale arrest of members of the front under the reactionary "Internal Security Act."

    Two Thousand Port Workers in Peru Go on Strike
    Lima Dispatch: Two thousand workers at Peru's largest port, Callao, have been on strike since the 8th, demanding lower prices and improved living and working conditions.
    The Peruvian port authorities refused to meet the legitimate demands of the workers and unreasonably demanded that the workers compensate for the losses that may be caused by the strike.

    Franco Viciously Persecutes Patriots
    Paris Dispatch: According to the "Humanité" Madrid dispatch on the 9th, Franco's Spain is persecuting another group of Communists and people who oppose the Franco regime. Nineteen Communists face the risk of being sentenced to brutal punishments by the Madrid military court for allegedly participating in the Sixth Congress of the Spanish Communist Party. In addition, nineteen patriots face persecution by the Barcelona military court.
    The permanent military tribunals in Madrid, Oviedo, and Barcelona will also try seventy-four Spaniards. Their only crime is the so-called "thought crime."
