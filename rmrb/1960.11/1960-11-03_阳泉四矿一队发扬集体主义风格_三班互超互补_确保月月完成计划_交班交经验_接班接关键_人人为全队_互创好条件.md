(Our Taiyuan dispatch, 2nd) In the great battle to seize coal production by shift, by day, by ten-day period, and by month to complete the national plan, the coal mining team No. 1 from pit No. 1 of the Yangquan Mining Bureau's No. 4 Mine in Shanxi Province, everyone, based on their own shift and facing the whole team, created the advanced experience of "competing and complementing each other," organizing "mutual surpassing" between shifts when production conditions were good, and organizing "mutual complementing" between shifts when encountering difficulties, ensuring that "no shift falls behind for more than a day, and no team falls behind for more than ten days."

  Three Shifts as One Facet, The Whole Team as One Chessboard

As early as the competition movement in February and March of this year, the coal mining team No. 1, because the shifts did not clearly establish the idea of ​​"the whole team as one chessboard," although each shift actively tried to produce more coal, everyone only cared about their own shift's plan. When the working face conditions were good, each shift's production plan was also completed very well. When encountering difficulties, they often took care of themselves and affected each other, and each shift's plan was not completed well. Secondly, team and shift leaders and cadres did not promptly disclose information to the workers. Often, it was not until the 25th of each month that the captain announced the team's monthly plan completion status to the workers, and whether the shift's daily plan was completed well or badly was often announced to the workers after the shift handover. Because of the short time, it was not easy to make up for the loss if there was a deficit, which affected the completion of the team's monthly plan.

In mid-April, the Party Branch Committee of the No. 1 Recovery Team analyzed this situation and launched a large-scale airing of views, large-scale blooming, and large-scale debate among the team's employees to investigate the reasons and find measures. Through the debate, the indicators for shifts to lay the foundation for each other were clearly defined, and the slogan of "making up for deficiencies with surpluses" was put forward. When the previous shift did not complete the production task, the next shift was required to produce more coal to make up for the previous shift's deficit.

  No Shift Should Lose Production, No Day Should Be in Debt

After the slogan of "making up for deficiencies with surpluses" was put forward, the Party Branch earnestly summarized the workers' experiences and formed a set of production compensation systems: if the first half of the shift loses production, the second half of the shift should make it up; if the upper shift loses production, the lower shift should make it up; if today loses production, tomorrow should make it up; if this ten-day period loses production, the next ten-day period should make it up.

In order to ensure the implementation of this system, they insisted on the practice of the team and shift levels issuing tasks and measures to the workers at any time: the team announced the team's daily plan and the completion of each shift's plan every day; each shift explained to all workers the shift's tasks and the amount of work each section and each person should complete at the pre-shift meeting; the workers taking over the shift every two hours conveyed a message to the working face, telling the workers the coal output in two hours; the shift leader announced the amount of work completed in the first half of the shift at the mid-shift meeting. As a result, all workers were always aware of the completion of the shift and team's daily plan.

"Handover Includes Key Points" is an important measure for the No. 1 Recovery Team to make up for production. Whenever the upper shift loses production, the workers of the next shift must ask what the key is, so as to learn the lessons, take measures in a targeted manner, and make up for the amount lost by the upper shift. One day in late September, Wu Dengke's shift only completed 90% of the shift production plan due to a tail wheel accident on the coal chute. During the shift handover, they handed over this key point to Zhang Ziqin's shift. After careful research by the veteran workers, the tail wheel accident was eliminated. By the end of the shift, they not only made up for the previous shift's deficit but also exceeded the shift plan by ten tons.

  You Surpass, I Also Surpass; You Lose, I Surpass Even More

After the implementation of the production compensation system, the phenomenon of production loss decreased, but new problems also occurred: when the production situation was good in the first half of the shift, some people in the second half of the shift became slack; sometimes, when the production tasks were completed well in the first two shifts, the enthusiasm of the third shift workers was somewhat insufficient. From these facts, the cadres and workers of Team No. 1 increasingly felt that "making up" alone was not enough, and a "surpassing" should also be added. After discussions among all the workers in the team, a new slogan was further proposed: the second half of the shift surpasses the first half of the shift, the lower shift surpasses the upper shift, today surpasses yesterday, and this ten-day period surpasses the previous ten-day period.

Grasping the first shift and promoting the second and third shifts is a powerful measure for the No. 1 Recovery Team to organize overproduction. The first shift is the first battle of the team's three battles a day. Whether this battle is fought well or badly has a great impact on the second and third shifts. Therefore, they decided that the captain would follow the first shift to ensure that the first battle was fought well. When the first shift completes the plan, the second and third shifts are organized to try every means to surpass the first shift.

Handover of experience plays an important role in the lower shift surpassing the upper shift's output. In order to help the lower shift surpass the shift, each shift must hand over its advanced operating methods and experience to the lower shift during the shift handover. For example, one day in early September, Wu Dengke's shift created an advanced method that shortened the time for connecting the chute from six hours to four hours. During the shift handover, the workers taught this experience to Zhang Ziqin's shift, enabling Zhang Ziqin's shift to also overfulfill the shift plan. In this way, one shift passed on to another, and in just a few days, all three shifts used this method, generally shortening the time for connecting the chute.

  Mutual Surpassing and Mutual Complementation, Mutual Learning and Mutual Assistance

This set of "mutual surpassing and mutual complementing" methods promoted the habit of "mutual surpassing and mutual complementing" among the workers of the three shifts. They would surpass when they should surpass, and they would make up when they should make up. In order to surpass more, make up faster, learn well, and catch up well, the whole team also launched a comparison, learning, catching up, and helping competition between shifts, sections, and people. In order to strengthen the leadership of this competition, the Party Branch established a competition platform for red banner shifts, sections, and red banner bearers, held shift-by-shift evaluations, and raised red flags every day. Everyone in each shift strove to be the best, no shift fell behind, shifts laid the foundation for each other, created conditions for each other, left difficulties to themselves, and provided convenience to others, which became a common fashion among the team's workers. On September 15, Yan Fulu's shift was fully confident of overfulfilling the task of producing 190 tons of coal. However, in order to create high-yield conditions for the next shift, in addition to mining all the coal in the "empty lane" and maintaining the broken areas of the roof, they also built 45 meters of seat pieces for the next shift (15 meters more than the regulations). As a result, they lost 10 tons of production and did not complete the plan. During the shift handover, Yan Fulu said to Wu Dengke: "We lost 10 tons of production and want you to make it up." Wu Dengke said gratefully: "You have laid such a good foundation for us, we guarantee to make it up for you. Our plan is 222 tons, and we will make up 10 tons for you and surpass it by another 30 tons." Because the foundation was well laid, the shift production of Wu Dengke's shift reached 260 tons.

The "mutual surpassing and mutual complementing" competition, learning, catching up, and helping movement has fully developed the communist style of the coal mining team No. 1. The three shifts are united as one, everyone thinks of the whole team, and everyone plans for the whole team. Production is thriving. Since May, this team has completed the national plan every month except for August when it encountered particularly difficult continuous problems in production (which was made up for in September).

    阳泉四矿一队发扬集体主义风格
    三班互超互补　确保月月完成计划
    交班交经验　接班接关键　人人为全队　互创好条件
    本报太原2日电　在按班、按日、按旬、按月完成国家计划的夺煤大战中，山西省阳泉矿务局四矿一坑采煤一队，人人立足本班，面向全队，创造了“互超互补”的先进经验，在生产条件好的情况下，就组织班班“互超”；遇到困难的时候，就组织班班“互补”，保证了“班内亏产不过日、队内亏产不过旬”。
  三班为一面　全队一盘棋
    早在今年2、3月份的竞赛运动中，采煤一队因为班与班没有明确地树立“全队一盘棋”思想，虽然每个小班都积极想办法多产煤，可是大家却只关心自己的班计划，在工作面条件好的情况下，各班的生产计划也都完成得很好，遇到困难的时候，往往是各顾各，互相影响，各班的计划都完成得不好。其次是队、班领导干部向工人们交底不及时，往往是到了每月25日，队长才向工人们公布队的月计划完成情况，小班当天计划完成得好坏，也往往是在交班以后才向工人们宣布。因为时间短，有时亏产了就不容易补起来，影响到全队月计划的完成。
    4月中旬，回采一队党支部委员会，分析了这种情况，发动全队职工开展了查原因、找措施的大鸣、大放、大辩论。通过辩论，明确地规定了班与班互打基础的指标，提出了“以丰补歉”的口号。遇到上一班没有完成生产任务的时候，要求下一班多产煤，补起上一班所亏的产量。
    班不亏产　日不负债
    以丰补歉的口号提出以后，党支部又认真地总结了工人们的经验，形成了一套补产制度：前半班亏产后半班补，上班亏产下班补，今天亏产明天补，这旬亏产下旬补。
    为了保证这个制度的贯彻执行，他们坚持了队、班两级随时向工人交任务、交措施的做法：队每日公布队的日计划和各个小班班计划完成情况；每个小班在班前会上向全班工人交代全班任务和每段、每人应完成的工作量；每个班的接车工人每隔两小时向工作面传话一次，告诉工人两小时中出煤的情况；班长在班中会上，宣布前半班完成的工作量。这样做的结果，使全班工人对小班和队的日计划完成情况，时时心中有数。
    “交班交关键”，这是回采一队补产的一项重要措施。每逢上班亏了产，下班工人接班时，总要问清关键在那里，以便接受教训，针锋相对采取措施，补起上班亏的数量。9月下旬的一天，吴登科班因煤溜子发生跳尾轮事故，班产计划只完成90％。交班时，他们把这个关键交给了张子琴班。经过老工人们精心研究，杜绝了跳尾轮事故，到点时不仅补起了上班的亏产，还超额十吨完成了班计划。
  你超我也超　你亏我更超
    补产制度贯彻执行后，亏产的现象减少了，但同时也发生了新的问题：前半班生产情况好，后半班有些人就产生了松劲情绪；有时候前两班生产任务完成得好，第三班工人的干劲却有些不足。从这些事实中，一队的干部和工人们，越来越感觉到：光有了“补”还不够，还应该加上个“超”。经过全队工人的讨论，又进一步提出了新的口号：后半班超前半班，下班超上班，今天超昨天，这旬超上旬。
    抓第一班，促第二、第三班，这是回采一队组织超产的一个有力措施。第一个班是全队一天三次战役的第一次战役，这一仗打得好坏，对第二班、第三班有很大影响，所以，他们确定由队长跟第一班，保证打好第一仗。第一班完成计划时，就组织第二班、第三班千方百计地超过第一班。
    交班交经验，对于下班超过上班的产量起着重要作用。为了帮助下班超过本班，每个班在交班时，都要把自己班先进的操作方法和经验交给下班。如9月上旬的一天，吴登科班创造了一个先进的方法，使接溜子时间由六个小时缩短到四个小时，在交班时，工人们就把这个经验传授给了张子琴班；使张子琴班同样超额完成了班计划。这样一班传一班，只几天时间，三个小班就都运用了这个方法，普遍缩短了接溜子的时间。
    互超互补　互学互帮
    这一套“互超互补”的方法，促进了三个班的工人养成了“互超互补”的习惯，该超就超，该补就补。为了超得多、补得快，学得好、赶得好，全队还展开了班与班、段与段、人与人之间的比、学、赶、帮对手赛。党支部为了加强对这一竞赛的领导，建立了红旗班、段和红旗手竞赛台、班班评比，日日插红旗。各班人人争上游，班班不落后，班与班之间互打基础，互创条件，把困难留给自己，把方便送给别人，成为全队工人中普遍的风尚。9月15日阎福禄班攉一百九十吨煤的任务是满有把握超额完成的。但是，他们为了给下班创造高产条件，除把“空巷”的煤全采完，顶板破碎的地方维护好外，还给下班打好四十五米的座片（超过规定十五米），结果亏产十吨没完成计划。交班时，阎福禄对吴登科说：“我们亏产十吨，想让你们给补起来。”吴登科感激地说：“你们给我们打下这么好的基础，保证给你们补起来，我们的计划是二百二十二吨，给你们补上十吨，还要再超三十吨”。由于基础打的好，吴登科班的班产达到二百六十吨。
      “互超、互补”的比、学、赶、帮竞赛运动，使采煤一队工人们的共产主义风格得到了充分的发扬，三个班团结一致，人人为全队着想，个个为全队打算，生产蒸蒸日上。从5月份以来，这个队除8月份因生产中连续碰到特大困难，没完成计划外（9月份已补起），月月都完成了国家计划。
