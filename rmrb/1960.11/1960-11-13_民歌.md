Folk Songs

　　Wheat waves roll, nodding and smiling,
　　This year's crops are really good;
　　The stalks grow as tall as a person,
　　The heavy ears bend the stalks over.

　　Clear canal water winds around the mountains,
　　Terraced fields connect to the clouds,
　　Patches of grassland turn into fertile fields,
　　Rolling wheat waves weave into brocade;
　　Who brought such good times?
　　The people's leader, Mao Zedong!

　　Have you seen the peaks of the Bayan Har Mountains?
　　The Communist Party's kindness is higher and greater than them;
　　Have you seen the source of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers?
　　Chairman Mao's kindness is deeper and longer than them.

　　The highland barley grows as big as pearl necklaces,
　　We were not mistaken;
　　The grain is piled up over the mountains,
　　We were not wrong.

　　Hey ya, not relying on gods or Buddhas, but relying entirely on the sun, Chairman Mao,
　　Guiding us onto the road to happiness—the People's Commune!

    民歌
    麦浪翻滚点头笑，
    今年庄稼实在好；
    秆子长得如人高，
    穗头重把秆压倒。
    清清渠水绕山流，
    层层梯田接云头，
    片片草原变良田，
    滚滚麦浪织锦绣；
    是谁带来好光景？
    人民领袖毛泽东！
    你看见过巴颜喀喇山的峰顶吗？
    共产党的恩情比它还高还大；
    你看见过长江黄河的水源头吗？
    毛主席的恩情比它还深还长。
    青稞长得项珠般大，
    我们没有看错；
    粮食堆得盖过山头，
    我们没有说错。
    哎咿呀，不靠神仙不靠佛爷，全靠太阳毛主席，
    指引踏上幸福路——人民公社！
