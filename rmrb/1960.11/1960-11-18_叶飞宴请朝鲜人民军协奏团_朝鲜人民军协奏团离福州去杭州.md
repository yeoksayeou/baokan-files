Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 17th. Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Head of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Fujian Front, and General Han Xianchu, Head of the PLA Fujian Front, hosted a banquet on the afternoon of the 16th to welcome all distinguished guests of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, headed by Major General Zhang Ruihuan.

Among those attending the banquet were Lin Yixin and Jia Jiumin, Secretaries of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party; Chen Shaokuan, Xu Ya, and He Minxue, Vice Governors of Fujian Province; Lieutenant General Liu Peishan, Head of the PLA Fujian Front; and Major General Wei Chuantong, representative of our Ministry of National Defense, who accompanied the distinguished guests on their performance tour.

Comrade Ye Fei spoke first at the banquet, expressing his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the people of Fujian and all commanders and fighters of the PLA Fujian Front to the distinguished guests for their visit and performances on the Fujian Front.

Comrade Ye Fei said that the people of China and Korea fought shoulder to shoulder in the long struggle against imperialist aggression and made brilliant contributions. When American imperialism launched its aggressive war against Korea with great fanfare, the people of China and Korea fought side by side, defeating the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world—American imperialism, saving peace in the Far East and the world, and exposing the true face of the American paper tiger before the people of the whole world.

Comrade Ye Fei said that we resolutely support the statement issued by our government on the November 13th in support of the memorandum of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the peaceful reunification of Korea, and the soldiers and civilians on the Fujian Front resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people for the sacred cause of the peaceful reunification of their motherland. He said that the Korean people will surely achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland. Our territory of Taiwan will also surely return to the embrace of the motherland.

Major General Zhang Ruihuan, head of the Korean People's Army Ensemble, said at the banquet that we express our heartfelt joy for the brilliant achievements of the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Front in fulfilling their revolutionary tasks, just as we would for our own achievements, and we are very pleased with the achievements of the hardworking people of Fujian Province in building the socialist motherland and in the Great Leap Forward movement.

After condemning the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, Major General Zhang Ruihuan said that we must always maintain a high degree of vigilance against imperialism and wage a resolute struggle to defeat the imperialists. He said that the memorandum of our republic's government on November 11th thoroughly exposed the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism and once again clarified the plan for the peaceful reunification of the motherland. We firmly believe that our motherland will surely achieve peaceful reunification. Taiwan will surely return to the embrace of the Chinese people. If American imperialism continues its vicious aggressive conspiracies and activities, it will only accelerate its final demise. Our just common cause will surely achieve final victory.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly toasted the fighting friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea forged in blood, and the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

On the morning and evening of the 16th, the Korean People's Army Ensemble held performance visits in Fuzhou. At the end of the evening performance, Comrade Ye Fei, General Han Xianchu and others went to the stage to shake hands cordially with Major General Zhang Ruihuan and the actors, congratulating them on the success of their performance visit. The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Provincial People's Committee, and the PLA Fujian Front presented silk banners to the Korean People's Army Ensemble.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 17th. After a six-day performance visit in Xiamen and Fuzhou, the Korean People's Army Ensemble, led by Major General Zhang Ruihuan and accompanied by Major General Wei Chuantong, representative of our Ministry of National Defense, left Fuzhou by special train on the morning of the 17th to visit and perform in Hangzhou.
