Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Leopoldville News: Approximately four hundred residents of Stanleyville, the capital of Congo's Orientale Province, held a demonstration against the Mobutu rebel group. The demonstrators shouted slogans against the group's "Commissioner Committee," expressing their support for Prime Minister Lumumba.

News reports indicate that despite the Mobutu group's conspiratorial activities in Stanleyville, local military personnel and civilians who support Lumumba have maintained control of the city.

In the Manono region of northern Katanga Province, the Baluba people, who have launched a patriotic struggle, are bravely fighting against the reactionary troops of the Tshombe group who are suppressing them. News reports say that armed Baluba people have taken control of the situation there and have cut off the railway traffic between the Kamina military base and Kasongo in Kivu Province.

Xinhua News Agency, November 16th, Elisabethville News: Due to the increasing number of Baluba people resolutely opposing and resisting the "UN forces'" bloody massacres and atrocities in areas such as Niangba, the "UN forces" began to be forced to withdraw from parts of northeastern Katanga Province on the 15th.

According to a spokesman for the "UN authorities," the "UN forces" will change their approach to dealing with the activities of the heroic Baluba people.

Meanwhile, in the central region of Katanga Province, approximately five thousand Baluba people are gathering near Luena, a coal mining center, preparing to launch an attack on the city of Luena, which is occupied by the traitorous Tshombe group.

News reports say that on the 15th, a "UN force" rushed from Kolwezi to Luena in an attempt to intervene.

In the northeastern part of Katanga Province, a large number of Baluba people are gathering in the jungle areas there, preparing to launch a new struggle.

In other news from Leopoldville, the increasingly unstable rebel Mobutu is clamoring to hold a so-called "military parade" in Leopoldville on the 17th, and has used this as a pretext to transfer many troops from Matadi and Thysville to strengthen his forces.

Kasongo, the Speaker of the Congolese House of Representatives, sent a letter to the UN headquarters in the Congo, condemning Mobutu's transfer of troops as aiming to concentrate reactionary forces in the capital to strengthen the atmosphere of terror in order to intimidate the people and patriots.

Xinhua News Agency, November 15th, New York News: Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba recently sent a letter to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, the Irishman Boland, condemning the United States for funding a small group of people in the Congo to carry out subversive activities aimed at controlling the Congolese government.

The United Nations released yesterday the letter, dated November 11th, from the Congolese Prime Minister to the President of the General Assembly, who is being held under house arrest in Leopoldville by the Mobutu rebel group. In his letter, Lumumba exposed the "behind-the-scenes conspiracy" of imperialist countries such as the United States and Belgium to invade the Congo. He pointed out that the United States is funding subversive activities in the Congo. He said: "The thirty million francs recently seized in Stanleyville from a group of people who were plotting to seize power through a coup came from American sources." He also condemned the United States and certain UN member states for refusing to respect the decisions of the Congolese parliament. He emphasized: "The entire Congolese people are expressing regret over the attitude of the United States government."

Lumumba accused the imperialists and their lackeys of running rampant in the Congolese capital, causing widespread suffering. He said: In Leopoldville, "a small group of hired people are endlessly disrupting law and order. The people of Leopoldville are living under a reign of terror today."

    刚果人民坚持维护国家独立的斗争
    “联合国军”在刚果人民抗击下被迫撤出加丹加部分地区
    卢蒙巴致电联合国大会主席谴责美国颠覆刚果政府活动
    新华社17日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果东方省省会斯坦利维尔的约四百名居民举行示威，反对蒙博托叛乱集团。示威者高呼反对这个集团的“专员委员会”的口号，表示支持卢蒙巴总理。
    消息说，尽管蒙博托集团分子在斯坦利维尔进行阴谋活动，但是支持卢蒙巴的当地军民一直控制着这个城市。
    在加丹加省北部的马诺诺地区，掀起爱国斗争的巴卢巴人英勇打击镇压他们的冲伯集团反动军队。消息说，武装的巴卢巴人已控制了那里的局势，并且切断了加米纳军事基地同基伍省的卡松果之间的铁路交通。
    新华社16日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：由于愈来愈多的巴卢巴人坚决反对和抗击“联合国军”在尼昂巴等地区的血腥屠杀暴行，“联合国军”15日开始被迫撤出加丹加省东北部的部分地区。
    据“联合国当局”一位发言人透露，“联合国军”将改变对付英勇的巴卢巴族人活动的方法。
    同时，在加丹加省中部地区，约五千名巴卢巴人正在煤矿中心卢埃纳附近集结，准备向冲伯卖国集团占据下的卢埃纳城发动进攻。
    消息说，15日，一支“联合国军”从科耳威济赶往卢埃纳企图进行干涉。
    在加丹加省的东北部，大量的巴卢巴人民在那里的丛林地区集结，准备展开新的斗争。
    另据来自利奥波德维尔的消息报道，地位愈来愈不稳的叛乱分子蒙博托叫嚷17日要在利奥波德维尔举行所谓“军事检阅”，并借此从马塔迪和太斯维尔调来了许多军队，以加强实力。
    刚果众议院议长卡松戈曾致函在刚果的联合国总部，谴责蒙博托增调军队的目的是为了集中反动兵力在首都加强恐怖气氛来恫吓人民和爱国人士。
    据新华社15日讯　纽约消息：刚果总理卢蒙巴最近致函联合国大会主席爱尔兰人博兰，谴责美国正在资助刚果的一小撮人进行旨在控制刚果政府的颠覆活动。
    联合国昨天发表了这位被蒙博托叛乱集团软禁在利奥波德维尔的刚果总理11日给联大主席的信。卢蒙巴在信中揭露了美国、比利时等帝国主义国家侵略刚果的“幕后阴谋”。他指出，美国资助在刚果的颠覆活动。他说：“最近在斯坦利维尔从阴谋通过政变来夺取政权的一批人那里抄获的三千万法郎来自美国人士。”他还谴责美国及某些联合国成员国拒绝尊重刚果议会的决定。他强调说：“全体刚果人民都对美国政府的态度表示遗憾。”
    卢蒙巴指责帝国主义者及其走狗在刚果首都横行霸道，以致民不聊生。他说：在利奥波德维尔，“一小撮受人雇用的人正在无休止地破坏法律和秩序。利奥波德维尔市人民今天生活在恐怖统治之下。”
