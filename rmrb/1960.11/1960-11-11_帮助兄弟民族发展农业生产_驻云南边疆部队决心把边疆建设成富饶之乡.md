Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 9th. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed on the Yunnan border are vigorously assisting various fraternal nationalities in developing agricultural production, and have been warmly praised by the fraternal nationalities. They enthusiastically sang: The cicada changed its tune, the horse changed its shoe. The hard days are over, the sun shines on the mountaintop. The sun is the Communist Party, the sun is Chairman Mao. Bringing the sunlight are our dear ones, the People's Liberation Army.

In order to help the border fraternal nationalities catch up with the advanced Han nationality as soon as possible, the Yunnan garrison has continuously dispatched a large number of outstanding officers and soldiers over the past few years to form ethnic work teams, dispersed to more than 2,000 villages inhabited by minority nationalities. Under the leadership of the local Party committee and government, they help the fraternal nationalities develop agricultural production. In order to enable the K苦聪 (Kǔ Cōng) brothers wandering in the primitive forests to settle down and produce, a certain unit sent soldiers eight times into the deep mountains and dense forests to find them, help them build villages, teach them how to reclaim land and cultivate the land, develop agricultural production, and organize them to establish mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives, so that their lives have undergone fundamental changes. In the Ximeng山区 (Xīméng shānqū) area inhabited by the 佧佤 (Kǎwǎ) people, the average person had 300 catties of grain in 1958. In 1959, with the help of more than 30 ethnic work groups sent by the border guards, they conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and grain production was unprecedentedly abundant.

While sending out work teams, the Yunnan border troops also regularly organize manpower to participate in some intensive farm work. According to incomplete statistics, since last year, the Yunnan garrison has done more than one million workdays for the fraternal nationalities, helping them reclaim and transform more than 10,000 mu of land, build two small and medium-sized reservoirs, five dams, and 96 ditches, totaling more than 128,000 meters in length. They have accumulated more than 2 billion catties of fertilizer, plowed, hoeed, planted, and harvested more than 20,000 mu of land. Last year, the Hani, Yao, and Miao people on the banks of the 金水河 (Jīnshuǐ Hé) River wanted to build a reservoir, and the local garrison immediately sent cadres to help them survey and design it. When construction began, all the officers and soldiers came out together, helping to build the reservoir and transform the fields. In a short period of time, more than 230 mu of dry land were transformed into paddy fields. During the drought resistance in April and May this year, they went all out to build a large canal more than 300 meters long for the local people's commune, which played a great role in ensuring a bumper harvest in agriculture. People of all ethnic groups are extremely grateful for the help and support of the troops. They call the reservoirs built by the troops "Army-People Happiness Reservoirs," the fields opened by the troops "Great Army Fields," and the cooperatives established with the help of the troops "August 1st Agricultural Cooperatives."

The exemplary actions of the Yunnan border troops, who regard the border as their home and actively participate in border construction, have been continuously praised and encouraged by the local Party committees and governments. Recently, under the call of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, the officers and soldiers are determined to devote greater efforts to build the border of the motherland into a beautiful and prosperous land of fish and rice together with the fraternal nationalities.

    帮助兄弟民族发展农业生产
    驻云南边疆部队决心把边疆建设成富饶之乡
    新华社昆明9日电　中国人民解放军驻云南边疆部队，大力帮助各兄弟民族发展农业生产，受到兄弟民族的热烈赞扬。他们热情地歌颂道：蝉儿换了声音，马儿换了掌钉。苦日子已经熬尽，太阳照在山顶。太阳是共产党，太阳是毛主席。带来太阳光的，是亲人解放军。
    云南驻军为了帮助边疆兄弟民族迅速赶上先进的汉民族，几年来不断抽调大批优秀官兵，组成民族工作队，分散到少数民族聚居的二千多个村寨，在当地党委和政府领导下，帮助兄弟民族发展农业生产。某部为了使漂泊在原始森林中的苦聪兄弟定居生产，派出战士八次进入深山密林，把他们找出来，帮助他们建寨子，教他们开荒种地，发展农业生产，组织他们建立互助组、农业生产合作社，使他们的生活发生了根本变化。佧佤族聚居的西盟山区，1958年每人平均有三百斤粮食，1959年他们在边防军派出的三十多个民族工作组帮助下，认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，粮食生产空前丰收。
    在派出工作组的同时，驻云南边疆部队还经常组织人力参加一些突击性的农活。据不完全统计，去年以来，云南驻军已为兄弟民族做了一百多万个劳动日，帮助兄弟民族开荒、改田一万多亩，修中小型水库两座，筑水坝五个、修水沟九十六条，长达十二万八千多米。积肥二十多亿斤，犁田、锄草、栽种、收割二万多亩。去年，金水河畔的哈尼、瑶和苗族人民要修水库，当地驻军立即派出干部帮助他们勘测和设计。施工开始，全体官兵又一齐出动，一面帮助修水库，一面改田，在短短时间内，旱地改水田二百三十多亩。今年4、5月间抗旱时，他们又全力以赴，为当地人民公社修了一条三百多米长的大水渠，对保证农业丰收起了很大作用。各族人民异常感激部队的帮助和支援。他们把部队修的水库称做“军民幸福水库”，把部队开的田称“大军田”，把部队帮助建立起来的合作社称做“八一农业合作社”。
    云南边防部队这种以边疆为家，积极参加边疆建设的模范行动，受到了当地党委和政府的不断赞扬和鼓励。最近，官兵们在大办农业，大办粮食的号召下，决心尽更大的力量，同兄弟民族一道，将祖国的边疆建设成美丽富饶的鱼米之乡。
