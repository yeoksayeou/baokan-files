Xinhua News Agency, November 4th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Communist Party is launching election campaigns nationwide with the political slogan of striving to establish a democratic united government against the "Security Treaty."

In Tokyo, seven JCP candidates are holding speech meetings day and night in the streets and indoors, calling on the people to fight for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and to strive for Japan's neutralization.

Suzuki Ichizo, a member of the JCP Central Committee, called on the audience who filled the venue at a speech meeting on the evening of the 3rd to unite and force the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan and the removal of U.S. military bases, and to strive for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Japan, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States. Suzuki emphasized that this is the only way to ensure Japan's security.

Suzuki exposed that the Liberal Democratic Party received 2 billion yen in election funds from monopoly capitalists and called on voters not to vote for Liberal Democratic Party candidates.

Kikunami Katsumi, a member of the JCP Central Committee, exposed the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism to more than a thousand workers at a rally held by the Tokyo Metropolitan Central District Trade Union Council to protest the assassination of Socialist Party Chairman Inejiro Asanuma on the 1st. He said that wherever U.S. imperialism goes, there are conspiracies and acts of terror. Currently, the United States is interfering in the Japanese elections through various propaganda machines.

Kikunami emphasized that, however, if we unite to deal with the enemy, we will certainly be able to force U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital to become even more isolated.

Kikunami also exposed the deceptiveness of the Liberal Democratic Party's "doubling national income" plan. He pointed out that small and medium-sized enterprises in various industries can only force the Japanese government to reduce taxes through united struggle.

Kamiyama Shigeo, a member of the JCP Central Committee, delivered a speech to more than 500 listeners in front of Ikebukuro Station Square on the 1st. He emphasized that the Japanese people demonstrated an invincible and enormous force during the struggle against the "Security Treaty." Kamiyama called on the Japanese people to strive for victory in the general election and prevent Japan from further militarization.

Ii Yashiro, a member of the JCP Central Committee, focused on exposing to housewives in residential areas the Japanese government's conspiracy to revise the constitution in a malicious way to pave the way for the implementation of a conscription system.

In addition to holding speech meetings, communist organizations in various regions have also organized candidate support associations; launched signature campaigns to collect signatures against the "Security Treaty" and demanding the establishment of a democratic united government; and strived to expand the circulation of the "Akahata" newspaper to help the party's candidates achieve victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo dispatch: An increasing number of trade unions in various parts of Japan have expressed their support for Japanese Communist Party candidates in the general election.

In Tokyo, by the end of October, more than 330 grassroots trade unions had expressed their support for the candidates of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party.

In Osaka, an industrial center, the number of trade unions that have decided to support the Japanese Communist Party has reached 130, double the number of trade unions that supported the Communist Party in the last general election. Among these trade unions are the Osaka Regional Headquarters of the National Railway Workers' Union, the Osaka Teachers' Union, the Osaka Printing Workers' Union Federation, and various government agencies' employee unions.

"Akahata" reported that these trade unions not only support the Japanese Communist Party, but also actively carry out election campaigns for JCP candidates. In one post office, all the union members belonging to the All-Communications Workers' Union united to support the Japanese Communist Party candidate. In Osaka City Hall, hundreds of union members are brewing a broad union to support the Japanese Communist Party candidate.

In Nagano Prefecture, even a local union belonging to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has decided to support the Japanese Communist Party.

In Hokkaido, the trade union councils in ten cities and regions, including Sapporo and Otaru, have decided to support the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party. Many workers have also volunteered to apply to participate in the JCP candidate support association. These workers have also formed teams with JCP members to carry out propaganda work in rural areas.

In a certain constituency in Niigata Prefecture, 300 farmers have applied to join the JCP candidate support association.
