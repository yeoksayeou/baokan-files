    Sure to Win

    All efforts must be concentrated on solving key problems.

    Work itself contains many aspects of varying importance and priority, and involves different contradictions. Spreading efforts evenly and adopting a "grasp everything" approach not only fails to solve problems but also delays progress and wastes energy. Focusing major efforts on key problems and resolving them one by one is the way to be sure of victory.

    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us, "Do not fight unprepared battles," "Do not fight rashly," and "Strike to win." This means that there should be no element of luck in fighting a war. We should not seek accidental victories in the course of battle, but must make all preparations before the battle to create an absolute advantage for victory. Comrade Mao Zedong particularly emphasized concentrating six, five, four, or at least three times the enemy's strength to form an overwhelming and inevitable advantage for a comprehensive annihilation. This is very logical. Because with an overwhelming advantage, problems can be solved thoroughly and cleanly, and we can truly achieve "complete control over the odds of victory." The news about the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's ironmaking system concentrating its superior forces to tackle key production problems is an example of applying Comrade Mao Zedong's guiding ideology of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation wars in industrial production.

### 稳操胜券

    稳操胜券
    一切工作都要集中力量解决关键问题。
    工作本身包含许多主次轻重不同的方面，存在一些不同的矛盾，平均地使用了力量，“一把抓”的做法，不但不能解决问题，反而拖延了时日，耗费了精力。而集中主要力量对准关键问题，逐个加以解决，就能稳操胜券。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“不要打无准备的仗”，“不要轻易打”，“打则必胜”。这就是说，打仗绝不能存有任何侥幸心理，不应当在战斗的进程中去求得偶然的胜利，而必须在战斗之前就作好一切准备，造成胜利绝对优势。毛泽东同志特别强调集中六倍、五倍、四倍、至少是三倍于敌之兵力，形成压倒一切的必然优势，全面歼灭，这是很有道理的。因为有了压倒的优势，可使问题解决得彻底、干净，可以真正做到“胜算全操在手”。武汉钢铁公司炼铁系统各厂矿采取集中优势力量攻打生产关键的新闻，就是把毛泽东同志集中优势兵力打歼灭战的指导思想运用到工业生产中的一个例证。
