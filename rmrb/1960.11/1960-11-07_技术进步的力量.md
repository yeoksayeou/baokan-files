The Power of Technological Progress
By our correspondent Li Nan

    For more than two years, Soviet industrial enterprises have been taking technological progress as the central link in promoting production. In this broad movement of technological progress, much heavy manual labor has been mechanized, and tens of thousands of automatic work lines and automatic machine tools have been produced. Industrial production has taken a big step towards overall automation.

    The Moscow industrial area is installing more than a thousand automated and semi-automated work lines, five hundred mechanized conveyor belts, and fourteen thousand automated and semi-automated machine tools. Twenty-seven Moscow factories will become fully automated factories within the Seven-Year Plan. Some older machine factories, like the "Red Proletarian" factory and the "Orzhonikidze" factory, are being gradually converted into factories specializing in the production of automated lathes and instruments. Three small mechanical factories in Moscow have already been transformed into factories producing automated work lines.

    Leningrad is engaged in a heated competition with Moscow in terms of technological progress. This city is making twenty-one enterprises move towards full automation. Leningrad plans to establish more than two hundred automatic production lines.

    The movement of technological progress is being implemented in all industrial sectors and newly built factories and mines, as well as existing enterprises. This year, the machine-building sector is burdened with the task of ensuring the technological progress of various sectors of the national economy. The output of automated and semi-automated lathes will increase by one-fifth compared to last year, and the output of highly precise lathes, automated and semi-automated work lines, control instruments, and computers will increase by more than one-third compared to last year. The petroleum, coal, electricity, and metallurgical industries are all expanding the scope of technological progress. For example, the Kuzbass mining area will gradually fully automate thirty-six mines and fifteen ore dressing plants.

    The Moscow Automobile Factory, an old automobile factory built in the 1930s, is now regaining its youth in the technological progress movement. The factory's employees are building automatic work lines from some ordinary lathes. The design team led by engineer Agalov has created an automatic line for manufacturing speed regulators from existing ordinary lathes, which is the first automatic line of its kind in the Soviet Union. Another design team has also created automatic lines from ordinary machine tools. The factory originally had only nine automatic lines, but the number is gradually increasing and will total one hundred and seventy. After this, the factory's main and auxiliary labor, from final assembly to transportation, will be mechanized and automated. The First Ball Bearing Factory already has a fully automated workshop, and four more workshops will soon join the ranks of full automation. The factory will gradually ensure that 90% of the bearings are produced through fully automated workshops.

    In order to promote technological progress, many new organizational forms of cooperation and combination between ordinary workers and technicians, and between scientific workers and practical producers, have emerged. Last summer, the Ural Wagon Factory in Sverdlovsk took the lead in organizing mass design bureaus, absorbing engineers, technicians, and workers to jointly carry out design work. Now there are more than six hundred mass design bureaus in this state, one hundred and fifty in Stalinsk State, and ninety in the Lithuanian Republic. The mass design bureau of the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant has designed many new machine products and is undertaking the overall automation of the factory.

    Leningrad has made meticulous organizational efforts to promote technological progress and has universally mobilized the masses. First, the city's grassroots Party organizations established two thousand five hundred supervision committees to lead and supervise technological progress. Each enterprise also organized a technical committee responsible for the technical level of the factory's products and the review of the factory's technical policies. The Vyborg District established a district technical progress promotion conference, with initiative groups and scientific and technical work teams under it, to go deep into enterprises to promote technological innovation. Many factories and enterprises have also established production innovator conferences to specifically study and recommend rationalization proposals from employees and organize promotion work. The "Russian Internal Combustion Engine" factory mobilized employees to formulate individual technological progress plans. More than 80% of the workers have formulated such plans, and more than two thousand two hundred technical improvement suggestions have been put forward. The "Izhorsky" Mechanical Factory established a committee for promoting welding technology, with designers, engineers, and workers participating, to promote advanced methods of using welding to replace cast and forged parts, achieving good results.

    Organizing comprehensive work teams is the backbone of the Soviet factories and enterprises in implementing the technological progress movement. The Moscow First Ball Bearing Factory now has seventy-five comprehensive work teams, including all the production innovators and advanced workers in the factory. The Kolomna Diesel Locomotive Factory has two hundred comprehensive work teams. The comprehensive work team led by Muravyov has designed many universal machine attachments that can load and unload, so that the same parts can be used multiple times, saving 30% of metal consumption. Many factories and enterprises have also launched a competition to strive for excellent comprehensive creative work teams. Some comprehensive work teams have also adopted the method of combining with forces outside the factory.

    Re-equipping existing enterprises, renovating and expanding existing factories, and modernizing the original equipment is an important part of the Soviet technological progress movement. The Vladimir State took the lead in proposing a plan to renovate and expand existing factories, and after technological innovation, the output will be doubled. Ivanovo State took the lead in modernizing existing equipment and plans to modernize the textile machinery in the entire state within the Seven-Year Plan.

    During the Seven-Year Plan period, Soviet machine factories are preparing to modernize four hundred thousand machine tools, which can increase the production capacity of each machine tool by 25%, and in some cases even double it. Last year, the Russian Federation modernized thirty-six thousand machine tools and forging machines, and the effect of this innovation is equivalent to building six large machine factories. Half of the factories and enterprises in the Latvian Republic are carrying out expansion and modernization work with technological progress as the content. The Riga Turbine Machine Factory is renovating the casting workshop to modernize the original equipment, and as a result, the casting capacity will be doubled.

    Modernizing existing equipment fully demonstrates the power of the technological innovation movement. The Ural Electrical Equipment Factory encountered difficulties when trial-producing a 150,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generator. The factory did not have a machine that could bore such a large part, so the employees modernized the original machine tool and added attachments. As a result, this process was completed quickly. The Ural Automobile Factory used the innovated machine tools in the establishment of automatic work lines, accelerating the automation process and greatly saving investment costs at the same time.

    Many factories and enterprises, especially those in the European part of the Soviet Union, attach great importance to the work of modernizing equipment. The Meqixin Machinery Factory in Moscow State has established a special design institution to handle this task. The New Kramatorsk Heavy Machinery Factory in Ukraine plans to produce more than three thousand tons of equipment this year to help other factories and enterprises implement modernization. The Leningrad Hardware Factory decided to modernize the turbine generators with a power generation capacity of 100,000 kilowatts produced by the factory in the first quarter of next year. The employees of the Lugansk "October Revolution" Locomotive Factory decided to modernize the three hundred locomotives produced by the factory and currently used on various railway lines this year.

    As a result of the implementation of technological progress, the production level and technical level of Soviet industrial enterprises are constantly advancing. In the power industry, the Soviet Union now has more than one hundred large and medium-sized hydroelectric power stations, and more than four hundred generator sets have been fully automated. In thermal power stations, 85% of boiler operations have been fully automated. In the coal mining industry, the processes of coal cutting, coal falling, and coal transportation have been almost completely mechanized. Fully mechanized mines have begun to appear. In the steel industry, many control and adjustment procedures in the blast furnace production process have been automated, and most open-hearth furnaces have been equipped with automatic inspection instruments and temperature regulators. The petroleum and gas industry has also begun to gradually transition from partial automation to full automation.

    In the past year or two, many Soviet production technologies have surpassed the most developed capitalist countries and become the world's leading. For example, blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and continuous rolling equipment in the steel industry have greatly surpassed the level of the United States. Recently, some important enterprise sectors in the Soviet Union have seen the completion of new enterprises that are among the best in the world, and the construction of blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, rolling mills, hydroelectric generators, steam turbines, and cold rolling workshops that are the world's first is underway. These achievements illustrate the increasing advancement of Soviet production technology and also illustrate the great power of technological progress. (Attached picture)

    技术进步的力量
    本报记者　李楠
    两年多来，苏联的工业企业一直都把技术进步作为推动生产的中心环节。在这一范围广阔的技术进步运动中，许多繁重的手工劳动机械化了，成千成万的自动工作线自动机床产生了。工业生产向全盘自动化走了一大步。
    莫斯科工业区正在安装一千多条自动化和半自动化工作线，五百条机械化传送带，一万四千部自动化和半自动化机床。莫斯科的二十七家工厂将在七年计划内成为全盘自动化的工厂。一些历史较久的机器工厂像“红色无产者”工厂、“奥尔忠尼启则”工厂都在陆续改成专门生产自动化车床和仪器的工厂。莫斯科已有三家小型的机械工厂改变成生产自动化工作线的工厂了。
    列宁格勒在技术进步方面和莫斯科进行着热烈竞赛。这个城市正在使二十一个企业走向全盘自动化。列宁格勒计划建立两百多条自动作业线。
    技术进步的运动贯彻在各个工业部门和新建的厂矿以及现有的企业当中。机器制造部门今年负担着保证国民经济各部门技术进步的任务，自动化和半自动化的车床产量将比去年增加五分之一，高度精密的车床、自动化和半自动化作业线、控制仪器和计算机的产量，要比去年增加三分之一以上。石油、煤炭、电力、冶金工业都在扩大技术进步的范围。例如，库兹巴斯矿区将陆续使三十六座矿井和十五座选矿厂完全自动化。
    莫斯科汽车工厂是一个三十年代就建设起来的老汽车工厂，现在正在技术进步运动中恢复青春。工厂的职工正在从一些平凡的车床中建立自动工作线。工程师阿加洛夫领导的设计组从现有的普通车床制成了制造调速器的自动作业线，这是苏联第一部这样的自动线。另外一个设计组也从普通机床制成了自动线。工厂原来只有九部自动线，现在数目正在陆续增加着，将共增加成一百七十条。这样以后，工厂的主要劳动和辅助劳动，从总装配到传送都机械化自动化了。第一轴承工厂现在已有一个完全自动化的车间，接着又将有四个车间投入完全自动化的行列。工厂将陆续作到90％的轴承都是经过完全自动化的车间生产出来的。
    为了推动技术进步，普通工人和技术人员之间，科学工作者和实际生产者之间许多协作和结合新的组织形式出现了。去年夏天，斯维德洛夫斯克的乌拉尔车厢工厂首先组织群众设计局，吸收工程师、技术员和工人共同进行设计工作，现在这个州已有六百多个群众设计局，斯大林斯克州已有一百五十个，立陶宛共和国已有九十个。乌拉尔重型机器厂的群众设计局已设计出了许多新的机器产品，并且负担起工厂的全面自动化工作。
    列宁格勒对于促进技术进步作了细密的组织工作，普遍动员了群众。首先这个城市的基层党组织成立了二千五百个监督委员会，领导和督促技术进步。各企业还组织了技术委员会，负责工厂的产品的技术水平和审查工厂的技术政策。维堡区成立了区技术进步促进会议，下面设有创议小组和科学技术工作队，深入企业推广技术革新。许多工厂企业还成立生产革新者会议，具体研究和推荐职工的合理化建议，组织推广工作。“俄罗斯内燃机”工厂发动职工订立个人技术进步计划，有80％以上的工人都订立了这种计划，已提出了二千二百多件技术改进建议。“依若夫”机械工厂成立了促进电焊技术委员会，由设计师、工程师、工人参加，推广用电焊代替铸造和冶锻部件的先进方法，获得良好成果。
    组织综合工作队是苏联各工厂企业贯彻技术进步运动的骨干力量。莫斯科第一轴承工厂现在有七十五个综合工作队，包括了全厂的全部生产革新者和先进工人。科洛明内燃机车工厂现有二百个综合工作队。由穆拉甫也夫领导的综合工作队设计出了许多万能的能装能卸的机器附件，这样使同一部件可以多次使用，能节省30％的金属消耗。许多工厂企业还发动了争取获得优良综合创造工作队的竞赛。有些综合工作队还采取了和工厂以外的力量结合的办法。
    对现有的企业进行重新装备、改建和扩建现有工厂，使原有的设备现代化是苏联技术进步运动的一个重要内容。乌拉季米尔州最先提出改建和扩建现有工厂的计划，经过技术革新，将产量提高一倍。伊凡诺夫州最先提出使现有的设备现代化，准备在七年计划内将全州的纺织机器现代化。
    在七年计划期内，苏联的机器工厂准备将四十万部机床现代化，这样可以使每部机床的生产能力提高25％，有的甚至一倍。俄罗斯联邦去年现代化了三万六千部机床和锻压机器，这种革新所获得的效果等于新建六座大型机器工厂。拉脱维亚共和国有二分之一的工厂企业都在进行以技术进步为内容的扩大和现代化的工作。里加的透平机机械厂正在革新铸造车间，使原有设备现代化，结果将使铸造能力提高一倍。
    使原有设备现代化充分表现了技术革新运动的力量。乌拉尔电气设备工厂在试制一台十五万瓩的水力发电机，在搪定子外壳时遇到了困难，工厂没有能搪这样大部件的机器，职工们就将原有的机床现代化，加上附件，结果这道工序很快就完成了。乌拉尔汽车工厂将革新的机床运用到建立自动工作线工作中，加速了自动化的过程，同时大大节省投资费用。
    许多工厂企业，特别是苏联欧洲部分的工厂企业都十分重视使设备现代化的工作。莫斯科州梅启申机械工厂成立了专门的设计机构来处理这项任务。乌克兰新克拉马托尔斯克重型机器工厂计划今年内超计划生产三千多吨设备来帮助其他工厂企业实行现代化。列宁格勒五金工厂决定在明年第一季度将工厂先后出产的发电能力为十万瓩的透平发电机现代化。卢干斯克“十月革命”机车工厂职工决定，要在今年内将本厂生产的现在各铁路线使用的三百台机车现代化。
    由于实施技术进步的结果，苏联工业企业的生产水平和技术水平在不断前进。在动力工业中，苏联现在已经有一百多个大型和中型水电站、四百多个发电机组已全部自动化，火电站中85％的锅炉工作已完全自动化。采煤工业中的割煤、落煤、运煤等过程几乎已全部机械化。全盘机械化的矿井已开始出现。在钢铁工业中，高炉生产过程中的许多控制和调节工序都已自动化，大部分平炉都已装备了自动检查仪器和温度调节器。石油和瓦斯工业部门，也已开始从部分自动化逐步向全面自动化过渡。
    苏联的许多生产技术近一两年来都超过了最发达的资本主义国家跃居世界首位。例如钢铁工业中的高炉、平炉、连续轧钢设备，都大大超过了美国的水平。最近以来，苏联一些重要企业部门都有全世界数一数二的新企业落成，并且正在修建居世界第一的高炉、平炉、轧钢机、水轮发电机、汽轮机、冷轧车间。这些成就说明了苏联生产技术的日益推进，同时也说明了技术进步的伟大力量。（附图片）
