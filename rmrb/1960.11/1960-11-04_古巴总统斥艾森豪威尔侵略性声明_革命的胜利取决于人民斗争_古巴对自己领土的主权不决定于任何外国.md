Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 2nd: Cuban President Dorticos condemned Eisenhower's statement on the 1st regarding the Guantanamo base as an attempt to create an atmosphere domestically and internationally to justify launching an armed aggression against Cuba.

    "Revolución" published Dorticos's speech today, stating that Cuba will not launch an attack on the Guantanamo base, but will demand the return of the naval base territory through legal procedures at an appropriate time. He said that Cuba's sovereignty over its own territory is not determined by Mr. Eisenhower's generosity, nor by any foreign power, but by the Cuban people.

    Dorticos pointed out that through mobilizing the people, the Cuban revolution will surely achieve victory. He said, "Our people's enormous moral and military mobilization, the enormous support mobilized by the people of other countries, and our powerful condemnation have stopped the aggression." He said, "If they launch an aggression against us in the next few days, we will also achieve victory in the battle. In the history of the people and the revolution, the victory of the people and the revolution does not depend on the decisions of counter-revolutionaries and powerful empires, but on the decisions of the people themselves who have engaged in the revolution."

    Dorticos said, "No one should harbor naive illusions, hoping that the American empire will willingly allow the existence of a free, independent, and sovereign Cuba." He pointed out that American imperialism has made many of the most absurd and stupid decisions in its desperate hysteria to try to destroy the Cuban revolution. If the Cuban people had not undergone military training, if the militia had not been militarily mobilized, the revolution would have been defeated by American imperialism long ago. He pointed out that sacrifices will be made, and various difficulties await us; however, we feel empowered to overcome all difficulties.

    古巴总统斥艾森豪威尔侵略性声明
    革命的胜利取决于人民斗争
    古巴对自己领土的主权不决定于任何外国
    据新华社哈瓦那2日电　古巴总统多尔蒂科斯谴责艾森豪威尔1日发表的关于关塔那摩基地的声明是为了在美国国内和国际上制造气氛，以便为发动一次对古巴的武装侵略进行辩解。
      “革命报”今天发表的多尔蒂科斯的讲话说，古巴不会对关塔那摩基地发动进攻，但是将在适当的时机通过法律手续要求收回这个海军基地的领土。他说，古巴对它自己领土的主权不决定于艾森豪威尔先生的慷慨风度，也不决定于任何外国强国，而是决定于古巴人民。
    多尔蒂科斯指出，通过动员人民，古巴革命必将取得胜利。他说，“我国人民道义上和军事上的巨大动员，其他各国人民动员起来的巨大支援以及我们有力的谴责制止了侵略。”他说，“假如他们在不久后的几天内发动对我们的侵略，我们也将在战斗中取得胜利。在人民的和革命的历史上，人民和革命的胜利不取决于反革命分子和强大的帝国的决定，而是取决于已经投入革命的人民本身的决定。”
    多尔蒂科斯说，“任何人不能抱有天真的幻想，希望美国这个帝国甘心让一个自由、独立和主权的古巴存在。”他指出，美帝国主义在它企图摧毁古巴革命的绝望的歇斯底里中作出了许多最荒唐和愚蠢的决定，如果古巴人民不进行军事训练，如果不对民兵进行军事动员，革命早就被美帝国主义击溃了。他指出，牺牲是会有的，各种困难等待着我们；但是，我们感到有力量克服一切困难。
