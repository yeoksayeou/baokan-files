Following his report, representatives from Tirana's workers, peasants, People's Army, women, youth, and intellectuals delivered speeches congratulating the festival. They all unanimously stated that under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Hoxha, they would contribute their strength to build the motherland more beautifully and prosperously, and resolutely fight against imperialism and modern revisionism.

After the meeting, a wonderful artistic program was performed.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 29th: Theodosi, alternate member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered a report at the celebration of the 16th anniversary of the liberation of Albania on the 28th.

In his report, he warmly congratulated the Albanian people on the festival and introduced the achievements made in the sixteen years since the liberation of Albania. He said that the life of the past sixteen years has best proved the correctness of our party's general line and the vitality and superiority of our new system in all aspects of life. Due to the great victories achieved in establishing our new socialist industry, especially as a result of the realization of agricultural collectivization during the Second Five-Year Plan, socialist relations of production have been established in our country, and the socialist economic foundation has been established. Due to these victories, the question of "who will win" has been finally resolved in favor of socialism.

Theodosi said that in 1959, the socialist economy already accounted for 87.3% of Albania's national income, and the total industrial output value plan of the Second Five-Year Plan formulated by the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party has been completed three months ahead of schedule. The total industrial output value in 1960 increased twenty-three times compared to 1938. Currently, fifteen days are enough to produce the total products of the entire year of 1938.

When talking about the prospects of Albania's Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), Theodosi said that the Third Five-Year Plan will mark a major step forward for Albania in building the material foundation of socialism. Albania will move more rapidly on the road from an agricultural-industrial country to an industrial-agricultural country.

Theodosi then elaborated on Albania's foreign policy and views on major international issues. He said that due to the correct policy of friendship and cooperation between the peoples of all countries followed by our party and our government, today our country has established diplomatic relations with twenty-four countries and has trade relations with more countries. Our People's Republic follows a foreign policy of defending peace and strengthening friendship between the peoples of all countries, supports the peace proposals of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, and has put forward concrete initiatives aimed at easing the tension in international relations and consolidating world peace. The repeated initiatives of our government to establish and strengthen relations with neighboring countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence are well known. The People's Republic of Albania has become an important factor of stability and peace in the Balkan and Adriatic regions.

He said that the Albanian people firmly advocate peace, not because they are afraid of war. Albania has never surrendered to the enemy, but because it hopes that the people of all countries can live in peace and friendship, and hopes to devote all its energy to the peaceful construction of the country.

Theodosi pointed out that the current balance of world power is such that socialist forces exceed imperialist forces, anti-colonialist and national liberation forces exceed colonialism and enslavement forces, and peace forces exceed war forces. However, we do not harbor any illusions. The current balance of world power only provides the possibility of stopping war, and these possibilities should be turned into reality. All events prove that although the position of imperialism has weakened, it has not abandoned its policy of aggression and war, and it will not abandon it as long as it exists. This policy followed by world imperialism, headed by U.S. imperialism, arises from the very essence of the capitalist system of man exploiting man and man oppressing man. Therefore, as stated in the 1957 Declaration of Communist and Workers' Parties: "As long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive wars."

Theodosi continued, saying that all events have fully proven our party's correct Marxist-Leninist assessment of the development of the international situation, and have proven our concrete analysis of the development of world affairs based on the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. He said that we oppose all attempts to portray imperialism as "peace-loving" and to paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries in the struggle to defend peace. Imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is the most vicious enemy of peace, the freedom of the people of all countries, and all mankind. The policy of making concessions to imperialism on matters of principle and begging imperialism for peace is due to fear and distrust of the strength of the people. Imperialism will never bestow peace, but must be forced to accept peace. Therefore, the current task is to educate the masses, to make them highly vigilant against the schemes of imperialism, to raise their revolutionary consciousness, to establish a broad front against the aggressive forces of imperialism, to mobilize all the powerful peace forces in the world today to take concrete actions, to take an uncompromising attitude, and to constantly oppose the plans of war-mongers.

Theodosi then exposed the despicable acts of the revisionists. He pointed out that the purpose of the revisionists is to paralyze the revolutionary vigilance of the proletariat, paralyze the revolutionary movement of the working class, and allow the bourgeoisie to restore its lost positions and prolong the life of capitalism. That is why the 1957 Moscow Declaration correctly called revisionism the main danger to the international communist and workers' movement. Therefore, our Labor Party, which has been loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism to the end, has constantly carried out ideological and political struggles against modern revisionism, and will fight until modern revisionism is completely crushed. Therefore, our party follows its internationalist task, because modern revisionism is a deadly enemy of the socialist camp and the international communist and workers' movement.

Theodosi said that today, just as imperialism is plotting various conspiracies against the socialist camp, and just as modern revisionism is doing everything possible to undermine the unity of the socialist camp, it is of particular importance to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. He said that the Albanian Labor Party regards this unity as the foundation of its foreign policy, and has always striven and will always strive to strengthen the friendship between our people and the people of socialist countries based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

    必须教育群众提高革命意识建立反对帝国主义的广泛战线
    新华社地拉那28日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、部长会议、民主阵线全国委员会和劳动党地拉那市委员会，今晚在地拉那歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院隆重集会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十六周年。
    参加庆祝会的有：阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希、劳动党政治局委员巴卢库、努什、马尔科、科列加等党政领导人。各国驻阿尔巴尼亚的外交使节也应邀出席了庆祝会。
    在庆祝会上，劳动党政治局候补委员、部长会议副主席蒂奥多西作了报告。在他报告之后，地拉那的工人、农民、人民军、妇女、青年和知识界的代表先后致词祝贺节日，他们都一致表示将在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下贡献出力量，把祖国建设得更美丽、更富强，并坚决为反对帝国主义和现代修正主义而斗争。
    会后，演出了精采的文艺节目。
    新华社地拉那29日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局候补委员、部长会议副主席蒂奥多西28日在阿尔巴尼亚解放十六周年庆祝大会上作了报告。
    他在报告中热情地向阿尔巴尼亚全国人民祝贺节日，并且介绍了阿尔巴尼亚解放十六年来所取得的成就。他说，十六年来的生活最好地证明了我们党的总路线的正确性，证明了我们新的制度在生活的一切方面的生命力和优越性。由于在建立我国新的社会主义工业方面所取得的巨大胜利，特别是由于第二个五年计划期间实现农业集体化的结果，在我国已经建立了社会主义的生产关系，建立了社会主义经济基础。由于这些胜利，“谁战胜谁”的问题已获得了有利于社会主义的最终解决。
    蒂奥多西说，1959年社会主义经济已经占阿尔巴尼亚国民收入的87.3％，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会所制定的第二个五年计划的工业总产值计划已经提前三个月完成。1960年的工业总产值比1938年增加了二十三倍。目前，十五天就可以生产出1938年全年的产品。
    蒂奥多西在谈到阿尔巴尼亚第三个五年计划（1961—1965）的远景时说，第三个五年计划将标志着阿尔巴尼亚在建设社会主义物质基础方面向前迈进重大的一步。阿尔巴尼亚将在从一个农业—工业国变为一个工业—农业国的道路上更迅速地前进。
    蒂奥多西接着阐述了阿尔巴尼亚的对外政策和对国际重大问题的看法。他说，由于我们党和我国政府所遵循的各国人民之间友好和合作的正确政策，今天，我国已经同二十四个国家建立了外交关系，并且同更多的国家有着贸易关系。我们人民共和国遵循着保卫和平和加强各国人民之间的友谊的对外政策，支持苏联和其他爱好和平国家的和平建议，提出了旨在缓和国际关系中的紧张局势和巩固世界和平的具体倡议。我国政府所一再提出的关于在和平共处原则的基础上建立和加强同邻国的关系的倡议是众所周知的。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国已经成了巴尔干和亚得里亚海区域的稳定和和平的重要因素。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决主张和平，这并不是由于它害怕战争，阿尔巴尼亚从来没有向敌人屈服过，而是由于希望一切国家的人民能够和平和友好地相处，希望把自己的全部精力致力于国家的和平建设。
    蒂奥多西指出，今天世界力量的对比是这样的：社会主义力量超过了帝国主义力量，反殖民主义和民族解放力量超过了殖民主义和奴役的力量，和平力量超过了战争力量。但是，我们不抱有任何幻想。目前世界力量的对比仅仅提供了制止战争的可能，还应该把这些可能变为现实。所有的事件都证明，虽然帝国主义的地位削弱了，但是它并没有放弃而且只要它存在一天也就不会放弃侵略政策和战争政策。以美帝国主义为首的世界帝国主义所遵循的这一政策是产生于资本主义制度人剥削人和人压迫人的本质的本身。所以，正如1957年共产党和工人党宣言中所说的：“只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤”。
    蒂奥多西接着说，所有的事件都充分证明了我们党对国际局势发展所作的马克思列宁主义的正确估价，证明了我们根据马克思列宁主义的不朽学说对世界事态发展所作的具体分析。他说，我们反对一切旨在把帝国主义说成是“爱好和平”的并且在保卫和平的斗争中麻痹各国人民的警惕性的企图。帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义，是和平、各国人民的自由和全人类的最凶恶的敌人。在原则问题上向帝国主义让步和向帝国主义乞求和平的政策，是由于恐惧和不信任人民的力量。帝国主义决不会赐予和平，而必须强使它接受和平。所以，当前的任务是教育群众，使他们对帝国主义的诡计保持高度的警惕，提高他们的革命意识，建立一条反对帝国主义侵略势力的广泛战线，动员今天世界上所有强大的和平力量采取具体的行动，采取毫不妥协的态度，不断地反对战争贩子的计划。
    蒂奥多西接着揭露了修正主义者的卑鄙勾当。他指出，修正主义者的目的是麻痹无产阶级的革命警惕性，瘫痪工人阶级的革命运动，而放任资产阶级恢复失去了的阵地，延长资本主义的寿命。这就是为什么1957年的莫斯科宣言把修正主义正确地称作国际共产主义和工人运动的主要危险。因此，对马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则忠诚到底的我们劳动党，曾经不断地同现代修正主义进行了思想上和政治上的斗争，并且将斗争到现代修正主义被彻底粉碎时为止。因之我们党遵循自己的国际主义任务，因为现代修正主义是社会主义阵营以及国际共产主义和工人运动的死敌。
    蒂奥多西说，今天，正当帝国主义策划种种阴谋来反对社会主义阵营的时候，正当现代修正主义千方百计地企图破坏社会主义阵营队伍的团结一致的时候，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结就具有特别的重要性。他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党把这一团结作为对外政策的基础，曾经并将永远努力加强我国人民同社会主义各国人民之间的建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的友谊。
