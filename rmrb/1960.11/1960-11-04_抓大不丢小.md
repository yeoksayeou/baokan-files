    Grasp the Big, Don't Neglect the Small
    Jiangxi Tea Region Delivers Autumn Tea
    Following the bumper harvests of spring and summer tea, Jiangxi Province has achieved another bumper harvest of autumn tea. Commercial departments are strengthening procurement. By mid-October, together with spring and summer tea, they have completed more than 80% of the state's annual procurement plan. Various regions, through vigorous technical innovation, have manufactured and promoted a large number of wooden processing machines, enabling all 200-plus tea primary processing factories in the province to increase their processing capacity. This has not only saved a large amount of labor but also improved tea quality.
    Jian'ou Completes Tea Procurement Plan
    Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, has completed this year's tea procurement task ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. The county's tea procurement volume accounts for about 90% of the total output, the most procured since liberation.
    This year, Jian'ou County's tea production achieved a bumper harvest. The tea output of spring, summer, and autumn seasons increased by more than 30% compared with the total tea output of last year.
    Zhejiang Actively Procures Late Autumn Cocoons
    The procurement of early autumn cocoons and mid-autumn cocoons in Zhejiang Province has basically ended. Late autumn cocoons are entering the market successively, and commune members in silk-producing areas are launching a high tide of quick harvesting and quick selling of autumn cocoons. According to recent statistics, the amount of autumn cocoons already purchased in the province has increased by 37.5% compared with the same period last year; twelve counties and cities, including Changxing, Pinghu, and Linhai, have completed this year's procurement plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota.
    Guizhou Harvests and Procures Chinese Gall
    Guizhou Province has achieved a bumper harvest of Chinese gall this year. The procurement plan for the third quarter was overfulfilled by 90%, and procurement is still continuing.
    The mountainous areas of Guizhou are one of the main producing areas of Chinese gall in China. This year, thanks to the attention and protection of people's communes in various places, this important chemical raw material has achieved a bumper harvest. During the ripening period, party organizations at all levels promptly organized forces to carry out rush harvesting and formulated labor remuneration according to local conditions, further stimulating the enthusiasm of commune members. In the harvesting process, all localities also paid attention to seed retention in order to further increase the output of Chinese gall next year.
