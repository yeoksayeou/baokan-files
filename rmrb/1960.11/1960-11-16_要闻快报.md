Among them, cadres who went to the front line of agriculture accounted for more than 80% of the total, and 7,000 of them have been assigned to work as rural commune party committee secretaries, directors, general branch secretaries, team leaders, and living management personnel.
    Most of these transferred cadres have good political thinking, firm stances, upright work styles, and strong work abilities.
