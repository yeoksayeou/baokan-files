Rely on the Masses to Push the Farm Product Procurement Movement to a Climax

Currently, as the autumn harvest and wheat planting work has largely concluded or is nearing completion in many areas, rural Party committees are working hard to strengthen leadership, mobilize the masses, arrange labor, and organize a high tide of the procurement movement for agricultural products. As a result, the procurement volume of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds has recently seen a significant increase nationwide. Comparing the procurement volume in late October with that in mid-October, grain increased by 73.44%, cotton increased by 9.96%, and oilseeds increased by 31.57%. This trend indicates that the post-autumn high tide of agricultural product procurement has begun.

From now until the end of the year, there are still fifty days. These fifty days have historically been the most concentrated season for agricultural product procurement in the year. This year, many regions have suffered from drought and flood disasters, and the planting of late autumn crops has increased compared to previous years. Autumn-harvested crops have also been delayed in ripening due to the summer drought. The harvest time for crops has been delayed compared to normal years. In addition, the area sown for autumn and winter crops this year is relatively large, requiring more labor and time. Many regions have temporarily postponed some harvest and transportation work that could be delayed. This has resulted in some of the agricultural products that were procured in September and October in previous years being shifted to this period for procurement. Therefore, the procurement volume in the next fifty days will be greater than in previous years, and the procurement tasks will be more arduous than in previous years. We must seize this valuable time and work even harder to complete the procurement tasks.

Procurement work should first focus on the main agricultural products and the main work links. The procurement high tide in November should center on grain, cotton, and oilseeds, with grain procurement being the primary focus. To do a good job in grain distribution and procurement, the most important thing is to do a good job of weighing and warehousing. This is the main link in grain work. In all areas where conditions permit, the harvested grain should be inspected, weighed, registered, and statistically accounted for in November, and sent to national warehouses and production team warehouses for storing food, seeds, and fodder. After weighing and warehousing, the grain yield will be clear, the inventory figures will be verified, and there will be a solid basis for correctly implementing the grain distribution policy. After weighing and warehousing, the grain procured by the state will be controlled by the state, and the grain collectively owned by rural areas will be jointly controlled by the basic accounting units and grain-using units. This will enable more planned processing, storage, and use, and better management of grain throughout society. We should grasp the central link of weighing and warehousing, drive other links, and do a good job of a series of tasks in grain procurement, from threshing and drying to processing and transportation, and do a good job of life arrangements and planned grain use. In addition to grain, cotton, oilseeds, flue-cured tobacco, and other agricultural products should also be inspected and weighed at the time of procurement and warehousing to ensure that the procurement figures are clear.

To launch a greater upsurge in the procurement of agricultural products, it is necessary to further mobilize and organize the masses. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always taught us that all our work must be closely relied on the masses and mobilized by the broad masses. This is true for revolutionary work, and it is also true for construction work; it is true for production, and it is also true for distribution. Our work of procuring agricultural products, like other work, must be done well on the basis of extensive mobilization of the masses. To mobilize the masses, we must hand over the policies to the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our policies should not only be known to the leaders and cadres, but also to the broad masses"; "When the masses know the truth and have a common purpose, they will work together"; "When the masses are united, everything will be easy" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, "Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily"). The Party organizations in many of our areas are doing procurement work precisely according to this principle and have achieved remarkable results. The Party's procurement policy is in line with the interests of the broad masses, and once the policy meets the masses, it will definitely be supported by the masses. Handing over agricultural products not only meets the needs of the state, but also meets the requirements of farmers to exchange agricultural products for daily industrial products and agricultural production materials. Party organizations in various localities must conduct thorough and meticulous ideological work in light of the local actual situation. It is necessary to publicize the current favorable situation and the importance of handing over agricultural products, and to publicize the principles of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and mutual support between regions through facts familiar to the local masses; it is also necessary to publicize the achievements of socialist construction and the great prospects for the future through comparisons between the past and the present. In this way, everyone can recognize the way to correctly combine overall interests with partial interests, long-term interests with immediate interests, and understand and appreciate the principles and policies of agricultural product procurement. This will mobilize the broad masses to enthusiastically support procurement work and actively hand over agricultural products to the state.

In the procurement movement, it is also necessary to carry out meticulous organizational work among the masses. If there is only the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses without rigorous and meticulous organizational work, it is impossible to complete the procurement work well. Who should mainly do the organizational work? We believe that, in adapting to the current system of "three-level ownership, with the team as the basis" in rural people's communes, it should be organized mainly by the production team (basic accounting unit) under the unified leadership and overall planning of the rural Party committee and the commune. Collaboration and mutual assistance can be carried out between teams when necessary, but the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange should be adhered to. The production team should specifically arrange the progress of handover according to the agricultural season and the requirements of agricultural product procurement, and effectively organize the necessary labor force, tools, and animal power to ensure the smooth progress of the procurement movement. The experience of many places has proved that in organizational work, attention should be paid to integrating the current agricultural work and handover work, and to closely linking all links of harvesting, threshing, drying, transporting, and selling; it is necessary to give play to the role of professional teams and to organize necessary mass assaults; it is necessary to have a longer-term plan for a period of time and a short-term arrangement for each day. In this way, it is possible to ensure the completion of the task and to save manpower and material resources to the greatest extent. Reasonable labor quotas should also be stipulated for various tasks of harvesting and procurement, and the method of evaluating work and recording points should be implemented, which is also an important condition for mobilizing the enthusiasm of commune members and improving labor efficiency.

All cadres participating in agricultural product procurement work should conscientiously implement the Party's policies and strictly act in accordance with the policies. What should be procured should be procured, and what should be left should be left to the masses. Payment must be made in a timely manner for the procured products, and money and goods must be cleared. Commercial departments, grain departments, transportation departments, banks, and finance departments should also closely cooperate and work together under the unified leadership of the Party committee to do a good job of related business work. These departments should rely on the masses to do a good job of agricultural product inspection, grading, payment, storage, processing, collection, and transportation, combine the mass movement within each department with the mass movement outside the department, and combine meticulous business work with extensive mass activities to ensure that the current mass handover movement is carried out in an organized and orderly manner, and to ensure the implementation of the state's policy of agricultural product procurement.

The mass line is the Party's fundamental line. Our revolution and construction are all based on the interests of the broad masses of the people; the strength of our revolution and construction lies in fully valuing and developing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people. For this reason, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have always opposed relying only on a few people to issue orders and relying only on a few people to do work coldly and quietly in the cause of revolution and construction; they have always advocated letting the masses fully understand the Party's principles and policies, and have always advocated organizing the masses to do the work vigorously and enthusiastically. We have always implemented the Party's mass line in our agricultural product procurement work. In the past two years or so, with the leap forward in rural production and the people's communeization, the mass movement of procurement has been further developed. In our current procurement work, we should continue to use and develop the experience of past procurement movements, rely on the high consciousness of the masses, and rely on the strength of the masses to make the procurement work both vigorous and solid. We firmly believe that as long as we further rely on the masses and mobilize the masses, we will definitely be able to continue to promote the development of the procurement movement and achieve a comprehensive victory in the procurement work.

### 依靠群众，把农产品收购运动推向高潮

    依靠群众，把农产品收购运动推向高潮
    当前，由于很多地方的秋收种麦工作已大体结束或者将近结束，农村党委对于农产品的收购工作，正在努力加强领导，发动群众，安排劳力，组织收购运动的高潮。因此，最近全国的粮食、棉花、油料等主要农产品的收购数量有了显著的增长。以10月下旬的收购量与10月中旬相比，粮食增长了73.44％，棉花增长了9.96％，油料增长了31.57％。这种趋势说明，秋后农产品收购的高潮已经开始到来了。
    从现在到年底，还有五十天的时间。这五十天历来都是一年里面农产品收购最集中的季节。今年许多地区受到旱涝灾害，种植的晚秋作物比往年增多，秋收作物也由于夏季受旱而贪青晚熟，农作物的收获时间比正常年景推迟了一些；再加上今年秋冬播种的面积较大，需用的劳力和时间较多，很多地区把一部分可以推迟的收获和运送工作暂时推迟了一些。这样就使往年在9月和10月收购的农产品，有一部分也要移到今后这个时期收购。因此，今后五十天的收购数量会比往年更大，收购任务会比往年更繁重。我们必须紧紧抓住这段宝贵的时间，用更大的努力来完成收购任务。
    收购工作应当首先抓主要的农产品和主要的工作环节。11月份的收购高潮，应当以粮食、棉花、油料为中心，其中首先要做好粮食收购。而要做好粮食的分配和收购，最重要的是搞好过秤入仓工作。这是粮食工作的主要环节。在一切有条件的地区，都应当在11月里面，把收获下来的粮食、验收过秤，登记入账，统计清楚，分别送入国家仓库和生产队储存食粮、种子和饲料的仓库。经过过秤入仓，粮食的产量弄清楚了，库存数字核实了，就有了确实的根据，能够正确地贯彻粮食分配政策；经过过秤入仓，国家收购的粮食由国家掌握起来，农村集体所有的粮食由基本核算单位和用粮单位共同掌握起来，就能够更有计划地加工、保管和使用，把全社会的粮食管理得更好。我们应当抓好过秤入仓这个中心环节，带动其他各个环节，从脱粒、翻晒到加工和运送，把粮食收购中的一系列工作做好，把生活安排和计划用粮工作做好。除了粮食以外，棉花、油料、烤烟和其他农产品，也要在收购入库的时候，验收过秤，把收购数字弄得清清楚楚。
    要掀起收购农产品的更大高潮，就必须进一步发动群众和组织群众。党中央和毛泽东同志经常教导我们，我们的各项工作都要紧紧地依靠群众、动员广大群众来进行。革命工作是这样，建设工作也是这样；生产是这样，分配也是这样。我们进行农产品收购工作，也像其他工作一样，必须在广泛动员群众的基础上才能做好。要动员群众，必须把政策交给群众。毛泽东同志说过：“我们的政策，不光要使领导者知道，干部知道，还要使广大的群众知道”；“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做”；“群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了”（毛泽东选集第四卷“对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话”）。我们许多地方的党组织，正是按照这样的原则去做收购工作，并且获得了显著的效果。党的收购政策是符合广大群众的利益的，政策和群众见面以后，是一定能得到群众拥护和支持的。交售农产品，不仅符合国家的需要，而且符合农民以农产品换取日用工业品和农业生产资料的要求。各地党的组织必须结合当地的实际情况，深入细致地进行思想工作。要宣传当前的有利形势和交售农产品的重要意义，要通过当地群众所熟知的事实，宣传城乡互助和各地区相互支援的道理；还要通过今昔对比，宣传社会主义建设的成就和将来的伟大远景。这样，就能使所有的人都认识到整体利益和局部利益、长远利益和眼前利益正确结合的途径，都了解和体会农产品收购的方针政策；就能动员起广大群众来热烈支持收购工作，踊跃向国家交售农产品。
    在收购运动中，还要对群众进行细致的组织工作。如果只有广大群众的革命热情，没有严密细致的组织工作，也不可能很好地完成收购工作。组织工作主要靠谁来做呢？我们认为，适应目前农村人民公社实行“三级所有，队为基础”的体制，应当在农村党委和公社的统一领导和通盘规划之下，主要以生产队（基本核算单位）为单位来组织。队与队之间在必要的时候可以进行协作，互相帮助，但是应当坚持自愿两利、等价交换的原则。生产队应当按照农事季节和农产品收购的要求，具体地安排交售的进度，切实地组织所需用的劳动力和工具、畜力等，保证收购运动的顺利进行。许多地方的经验证明，在组织工作当中，既要注意把当前各项农活和交售工作穿插结合起来，又要把收、打、晒、运、售各个环节环环扣紧；既要发挥专业队伍的作用，又要组织必要的群众性突击；既要有一个时期的较长计划，又要有每一天的短安排。这样，就能做到既保证完成任务，又最大限度地节约人力物力。收获和收购的各项工作，还应当规定合理的劳动定额，贯彻执行评工记分的办法，这也是调动社员群众的积极性、提高劳动效率的一个重要条件。
    所有参加农产品收购工作的干部，都应当认真执行党的政策，严格按政策办事。该收购的收购上来，该留的留给群众。收购了产品，必须及时付款，钱货两清。商业部门、粮食部门、交通运输部门、银行和财政部门等，还应当在党委统一领导下紧密配合、协同动作，做好有关的业务工作。这些部门应当依靠群众，做好农产品的验收、分级、付款、保管、加工、集运等工作，把各部门内部的群众运动同部门以外的群众运动结合起来，把细致的业务工作同广泛的群众活动结合起来，以保证当前的群众交售运动有组织有秩序地进行，保证国家收购农产品政策的贯彻执行。
    群众路线是党的根本路线。我们进行革命和建设，都是从广大人民群众的利益出发的；我们进行革命和建设的力量，在于充分重视和发扬广大人民群众的积极性和创造性。正因为这样，党中央和毛泽东同志历来反对在革命和建设事业中只依靠少数人发号施令，只靠少数人冷冷清清地做工作；历来主张让群众充分了解党的方针政策，历来主张组织群众大家动手，轰轰烈烈地做好工作。我们在农产品收购工作中，历来都贯彻了党的群众路线。这两年多以来，随着农村生产的跃进和人民公社化，收购的群众运动更有了进一步的发展。我们在当前的收购工作中，应当继续运用和发扬过去收购运动的经验，依靠群众的高度觉悟，依靠群众的力量，使收购工作做得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。我们深信，只要我们进一步依靠群众和发动群众，就一定能够继续推动收购运动的发展，取得收购工作的全面胜利。
