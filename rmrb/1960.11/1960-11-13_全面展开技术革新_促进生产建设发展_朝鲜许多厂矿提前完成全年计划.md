Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang Electric Dispatch: The Korean working class, actively responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party, has comprehensively launched a technical innovation movement and achieved great success in developing production and saving labor. Some factories and mines have completed their annual plans ahead of schedule.

According to reports in the Pyongyang newspapers, the factories and mining enterprises under the Korean Heavy Industry Committee, in the first nine months of this year alone, adopted 7,380 innovative technologies, inventions, and rationalization proposals put forward by workers, which greatly promoted the development of production and construction and saved 1.27 million workdays of labor.

The workers of the well-known Songjin Steel Works, which produces special steel and steel products, have been continuously innovating technically and completed the annual output value plan more than two months ahead of schedule on October 25. The steelmaking workers of this plant have shortened the steelmaking time by various methods. Currently, the time required for each furnace of steel is one hour and fourteen minutes shorter than in the same period last year, increasing the daily steel output to 270-350 tons. The workers who roll silicon steel sheets have improved the technical management of the old rolling mill, increasing the hourly rolling of steel sheets by 1.5 to 2 tons.

Various machinery manufacturing plants have also vigorously innovated technologies. In the first nine months of this year, employees in the machinery industry used more than 3,100 inventions and rationalization proposals for production. They successfully trial-produced a 3,000-ton hydraulic press and a 38-spindle automatic boring machine. In addition, various machinery plants vigorously promoted the mechanization and automation of the casting department, achieving remarkable results.

The mining departments have also innovated technologies in rapid tunneling, constantly creating new tunneling records. On October 24, the Lim Wan-seok work team of the Geomdeok Mine created a record of 20 blasts and 15.3 meters of tunneling in three shifts.

Employees in the light industry sector of Korea have also made significant achievements in technical innovation. In the first three quarters of this year, more than 570 rationalization proposals were applied to production, saving approximately 110,000 workdays of labor. In the textile industry alone, labor productivity in the third quarter of this year increased by 14.9% compared with the same period last year. The output value produced by each worker in the Sinuiju Enamelware Factory in the third quarter of this year increased by 70% to 100% compared with the same period last year.

The Pyongyang Silk Weaving Factory, which has become a red banner on the technical innovation front in the light industry sector, completed its annual plan ahead of schedule on October 28. The workers in the silk reeling workshop of this factory launched the "multi-machine multi-spindle" movement, increasing the hourly output of each silk reeling spindle by 30%. The workers in the silk weaving workshop promoted the five-person group collaboration method and strengthened their connection with maintenance workers, improving equipment utilization and labor productivity, and greatly increasing output.

The workers in this workshop have already begun work for 1961. Korean Central News Agency draft (Xinhua News Agency)

    全面展开技术革新　促进生产建设发展
    朝鲜许多厂矿提前完成全年计划
    新华社平壤电　朝鲜工人阶级积极响应朝鲜劳动党的号召，全面展开技术革新运动，在发展生产、节约劳力方面取得了巨大的成就。有的厂矿已经提前完成了全年计划。
    据平壤报纸报道，朝鲜重工业委员会所属的各厂矿企业，仅在今年头九个月当中，采纳了工人们提出的七千三百八十项革新技术的创造发明和合理化建议，因而大大促进了生产和建设的发展，并节约了一百二十七万个工的劳动力。
    著名的生产特殊钢和钢材的城津炼钢厂的工人们，不断革新技术，在10月25日提前两个多月完成了全年的产值计划。这个厂的炼钢工人用各种方法缩短炼钢时间，目前每炼一炉钢所需要的时间比去年同期缩短了一小时零十四分，使钢的日产量增加到了二百七十——三百五十吨。轧制矽钢片的工人们改进了旧轧钢机的技术管理，使每小时轧制的钢片比过去增加了一吨半到二吨。
    各机械制造厂也大力革新技术。在今年头9个月中，机械工业部门的职工们把三千一百多项创造发明和合理化建议用于生产。他们试制成功了三千吨的水压机和三十八轴的自动镗床。另外，各机械厂大力促进铸造部门的机械化和自动化，取得了显著的成就。
    各矿山部门在快速掘进方面也革新技术，不断创造新的掘进纪录。检德矿山林万石作业班在10月24日创造了三班爆破二十次，掘进十五点三米的纪录。
    朝鲜轻工业部门的职工在革新技术方面也取得了显著成就，今年头三个季度有五百七十多项合理化建议用于生产，节约劳动力约十一万个工。仅纺织工业部门的劳动生产率，今年第三季度就比去年同期提高了14.9％。新义州搪瓷器工厂每个工人生产的产值，今年第三季度比去年同期提高了70％到一倍。
    在轻工业部门的技术革新战线上成为一面红旗的平壤丝织厂，已在10月28日提前完成了全年的计划。这个工厂的缫丝车间的工人们展开了“多台多锭”运动，使每个缫丝锭子每小时的产量提高了30％。织绸车间的工人们推广了五人小组协作作业法，并加强了同保全工的联系，提高了设备利用率和劳动生产率，大大提高了产量。（附图片）
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的广大职工在生产中不断进行技术革新，大大提高劳动生产率。图为熙川精密机械厂生产钻岩机的车间只用了六个月的时间就提前完成了今年的生产计划。这个车间的工人早已开始做1961年的工作了。　朝鲜中央通讯社稿（新华社发）
