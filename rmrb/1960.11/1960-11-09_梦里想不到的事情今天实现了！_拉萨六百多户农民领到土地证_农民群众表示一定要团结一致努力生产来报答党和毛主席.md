Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Electric Dispatch: On November 1st, the Caigongtang Office of the East District People's Government of Lhasa City held a mass meeting to solemnly issue land certificates. More than 620 emancipated peasant households in the three townships under the jurisdiction of the office, who had been allocated more than 17,000 "ke" (1 "ke" is approximately equal to 1 "mu") of land during the democratic reforms, each received a land certificate on the 1st.

On this day, red flags fluttered everywhere in Cai Village, where the Caigongtang office is located, and cheers resounded. Many Tibetan slogans were posted on residences, village lanes, walls, and trees, reading: "Celebrate the Return of Land to the People," "Celebrate This Year's Bumper Harvest in Agricultural Production," "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party," "Long Live Chairman Mao," creating a festive scene. At noon, the peasants, wearing new clothes, carrying national flags, and holding portraits of Chairman Mao, marched to the meeting place with drums and gongs. Many elderly people in their seventies and eighties were also supported by their children and grandchildren to attend this extraordinary celebration.

Cuike Dunzhu Cairen, the Mayor of Lhasa City, and Wang Peisheng (a Hui ethnic group member), the Deputy Mayor, also rushed to congratulate the emancipated peasants.

After the land certificate issuing ceremony began, all the emancipated peasants first stood up to pay tribute to the portrait of Chairman Mao. This ceremony was unanimously requested by the peasants of the three townships before the meeting. They said that the serfs and slaves who had suffered like cattle and horses were able to be emancipated, all thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Today, with the issuing of land certificates, they should first thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

A band composed of more than 20 children of emancipated peasants played the song "Socialism is Good" with drums and flutes. Amidst the music, applause, and cheers, Ciren Deji, the Deputy Director of the Caigongtang Office of the East District People's Government of Lhasa City, handed out the land certificates one by one to the emancipated peasants. At this moment, the peasant masses were extremely excited, and many elderly people shed tears of emotion when they received their land certificates.

The emancipated peasants who received the land certificates stepped onto the podium to speak one after another. Ciren Zhuoma, the Director of the Cai Village Peasants Association Branch, who had disguised herself as a man for more than ten years under the feudal serf system to escape the humiliation of the serf owners, said excitedly: In the old society, all the land was seized by the three major feudal lords. We worked like cattle and horses, and our sweat soaked the land, but we couldn't get food. Today, the Party has led us to turn over, and the land has been returned to us. We must work hard to produce, unite as one, and practice increasing production and practicing economy to repay the care of the Party and Chairman Mao. Many peasants also used their personal experiences in their speeches to denounce the crimes of the old system and praise the happy life of the new society. They all expressed that they would always listen to the Party and always follow the Party.

Cuike Dunzhu Cairen, the Mayor of Lhasa City, extended warm congratulations to the peasants of the three townships on behalf of the Lhasa Municipal People's Government. He said: "What the peasants of Tibet could not even dream of in the past has come true today. We must always remember the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao."

After the celebration meeting, the emancipated peasants sang and danced, fully celebrating their festival. (Attached photos)

In the past, they had no land, and the whole family did hard labor for the serf owners, and were scattered. Now that the land has been returned to their homes and their sisters have reunited, they are immensely grateful for the kindness of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    梦里想不到的事情今天实现了！
    拉萨六百多户农民领到土地证
    农民群众表示一定要团结一致努力生产来报答党和毛主席
    新华社拉萨电　拉萨市东城区人民政府驻蔡公堂办事处1日召开群众大会，隆重颁发土地证。办事处所属三个乡的六百二十多户翻身农民，在民主改革中共分得一万七千多克（一克约等于一亩）土地，1日他们每户都领到了一张土地证。
    这天，蔡公堂办事处所在地的蔡村到处红旗飘扬，欢声雷动。住宅、村巷、墙头和树上，张贴着许多藏文标语，上面写着：“欢庆土地还家”、“庆祝今年农业生产大丰收”、“中国共产党万岁”、“毛主席万岁”，一片节日景象。中午，农民们穿着新衣，打着国旗，高举毛主席像，击鼓鸣锣涌向会场。许多七、八十岁的老人也由儿孙搀扶着前来参加这次不平常的庆祝大会。
    拉萨市市长崔科·顿珠才仁和副市长王沛生（回族）也赶来向翻身农民们祝贺。
    颁发土地证仪式开始后，全体翻身农民首先起立向毛主席像致敬。这项仪式是三个乡的农民在开会前一致要求的。他们说，像牛马一样地受苦受难的农奴和奴隶得以翻身解放，全靠共产党和毛主席的好领导，今天颁发土地证，首先应该感谢共产党和毛主席。
    一支由二十多个翻身农民子弟组成的乐队，敲着大鼓，吹着长笛，奏起了“社会主义好”的歌子。在乐声、掌声和欢呼声中，拉萨市东城区人民政府蔡公堂办事处副主任次仁德吉把土地证一张一张地发到翻身农民手里。这时，农民群众激动非常，很多老年人领到土地证的时候感动得流下了眼泪。
    得到土地证的翻身农民纷纷走上主席台讲话。在封建农奴制度下，为了逃避农奴主的侮辱曾女扮男装十多年的蔡村农民协会分会主任次仁卓玛激动地说：在旧社会，所有的土地都被三大封建领主侵占，我们像牛马一样地劳动，血汗把地都浸透了，自己却得不到粮食；今天，党领导我们翻了身，土地还了家，我们一定要努力生产，团结一致，厉行增产节约，来回答党和毛主席的关怀。许多农民在讲话中还用亲身经历控诉了旧制度的罪恶，歌颂新社会的幸福生活。他们都表示要永远听共产党的话，永远跟着党走。
    拉萨市市长崔科·顿珠才仁代表拉萨市人民政府向三乡农民热烈祝贺。他说：“西藏农民过去梦里也想不到的事情，今天实现了，我们要永远记住党和毛主席的恩情。”
    庆祝大会结束后，翻身农民们高歌欢舞，尽情地庆祝他们的节日。（附图片）
