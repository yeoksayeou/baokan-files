    Preventing Pig Feed Poisoning
    Feed crops grown on land where manure or nitrogen fertilizer has been applied in particularly large quantities, such as beets, cabbage, and radish leaves used for feed, all contain considerable amounts of nitrate. These things, after being cooked, tend to produce a lot of nitrite during the cooling process in a closed pot. Livestock that eat food containing a lot of nitrite will be poisoned. Over the years, varying degrees of nitrite poisoning have occurred in pig farms in Hunan, Henan, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Beijing, and other places. The symptoms of poisoning in pigs are: spitting out yellow foam (or white foam), unsteady standing, rapid breathing, ears congested and turning dark brown, and low body temperature. In severe cases of poisoning, the bridge of the nose, lips, and tips of the hooves appear cyanotic before death; upon autopsy, the blood is coagulated and appears reddish-black, the liver is dark brown, and the lining of the stomach and intestines have hemorrhagic inflammation of varying degrees of severity.
    In order to avoid accidents of nitrite poisoning, when preparing feed, be sure to cook the feed thoroughly, stirring constantly while cooking, and open the lid to dissipate heat after cooking. If nitrite is already found in the feed, a small amount of "potassium permanganate" can be added for disinfection before feeding.
    What to do if a pig has already been poisoned? "Methylene blue solution" can be used for first aid (oral dosage of 3 to 5 mg per kilogram of body weight, intravenous injection of 1 to 2 ml of 1% methylene blue solution per kilogram of body weight), or oral administration of 0.1% potassium permanganate solution, or injection of cardiac stimulants, etc.
    Currently, it is the season for using cabbage, radish leaves, etc. as feed, and it is hoped that pig-raising units in various places will pay attention to preventing this type of poisoning.　Feed Research Office, Animal Husbandry Department, Beijing Agricultural University

    防止猪饲料中毒
    在施用厩肥或氮肥特别多的土地上生长的饲料作物，如作饲料用的甜菜、白菜、萝卜缨等都含有相当多的硝酸盐。这些东西在煮熟后，闷锅温凉的过程中，往往容易产生很多亚硝酸盐。牲畜吃了这种含有很多亚硝酸盐的食物就要中毒。历年来，在湖南、河南、浙江、四川、北京等地猪场，都发生过不同程度的亚硝酸盐中毒现象。猪中毒后症状是：口吐黄沫（或白沫），站立不稳，呼吸急促，耳根淤血成酱色，体温低。严重中毒的在死亡前鼻梁、口唇、蹄尖呈现乌青；死后剖解，血液凝固呈红黑色，肝脏暗褐色，胃肠内壁有大小轻重不同的出血性炎症。
    为了避免亚硝酸盐中毒的事故发生，在调制饲料时，要把饲料煮熟煮透，煮的时候要不断搅拌，煮好以后要掀开锅盖散热。如果发现饲料中已有亚硝酸盐，可以加入少量“高锰酸钾”消毒以后再喂。
    猪已经中毒怎么办呢？可以采用“美兰液”进行急救（口服剂量每公斤体重用三至五毫克、静脉注射每公斤体重用百分之一美兰液一至二毫升。）或口服0.1％高锰酸钾液，或注射强心剂等。
    目前，正是使用白菜、萝卜缨等作饲料的时期，希望各地养猪单位注意防止这项中毒。　北京农业大学畜牧系饲料研究室
