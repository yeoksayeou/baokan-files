Early Winter Irrigation Prevents Spring Drought
Jingyuan County Starts Early, Completes Half of Winter Irrigation Plan

(Our dispatch) Gansu Province's Jingyuan County, in order to strive for greater grain production next year, has dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the fields to lead commune members in vigorously grasping winter irrigation work. Currently, the county's winter-irrigated land has reached 53% of the winter irrigation plan.

Since autumn this year, the Jingyuan area has experienced continuous low rainfall. Based on this situation, the Jingyuan County Party Committee began to focus on winter irrigation preparation work in early September. The county, communes, and production teams all established winter irrigation headquarters, and designated a secretary to be specifically in charge of water conservancy. At the same time, each production team and production group formulated detailed winter irrigation plans based on their specific circumstances, and proposed specific measures, thereby promoting the early commencement of winter irrigation work. The County Party Committee also designated the eight major canal systems in Wudaping as the focus, first carrying out land leveling, repairing main and branch canals, agricultural channels, pressing floodgates, extending canal ends, repairing drops, and water diversion gates, so that the projects could be rapidly completed. At the same time, it organized forces to inspect and install the machinery that could be used, and vigorously promoted the effective irrigation experience accumulated by the masses over the years. In order to make this work solid and meticulous, the county party secretary and many cadres and technicians went deep into the front lines to conduct specific leadership.

In order to ensure sufficient water sources and timely irrigation, the County Party Committee, based on the principle of prioritizing small-scale and immediate irrigation, first focused on the construction of small canal and agricultural branch canal supporting projects that were labor-saving, cost-effective, simple, and easy to implement. In the eight major canal areas with abundant water sources, it concentrated sufficient manpower to press floodgates and extend canal ends to prevent river water from dropping, and focused on land leveling, digging and repairing branch agricultural channels, so that every piece of land had branch canals for water passage, and every plot was built with small ridges, realizing river-canal connection and smooth water flow in the canals. In areas with a shortage of surface water and sufficient groundwater, it vigorously seized well digging and spring tapping to draw water for irrigation. In some areas of Wudaping that could be mechanically irrigated, it concentrated superior forces to repair machinery on the one hand, and dig water intake pools, diversion canals, level land, and reinforce canals on the other hand, using water economically and expanding the irrigated area as much as possible. In arid mountainous areas, the main focus was on repairing cellars and kilns in preparation for winter ice and snow accumulation.

    早冬灌  防春旱
    靖远县及早动手冬灌地完成计划一半
    本报讯　甘肃省靖远县为争取明年增产更多粮食，大批干部深入田间，领导社员狠抓冬灌工作。目前，全县冬灌地已达到冬灌计划的53％。
    今年秋季以来，靖远地区一直少雨。中共靖远县委根据这一情况，从9月上旬就开始抓冬灌准备工作。县、社、队都成立了水利冬灌指挥部，并确定由一名书记专管水利。与此同时，各生产队、生产小队都根据自己的具体情况，细致地制定冬灌计划，提出了具体措施，从而促进了冬灌工作及早进行。县委还确定以五大坪的八大渠系为重点，首先进行平整土地、整修干支渠、农毛渠、压涨口、延长渠梢、修跌水、分水闸等工作，使工程迅速配套。同时，对可以利用的机具，组织力量进行检修安装，并大力推广群众中历年来行之有效的灌溉经验。为使这些工作做得扎实细致，县委书记和许多干部、技术员都深入现场进行具体领导。
    为保证有充足水源和适时灌溉，县委本着以小型、现灌为主，首先抓了省工收效大、简而易行的小型渠道及农毛支渠的配套工程。在水源充足的八大渠道地区，集中足够力量压涨口，延长渠梢，防止河水下降，并以平整土地、挖修支农毛渠为中心，做到地地有支渠通水，块块培起小畦，实现河连渠，渠水畅通。在地面水缺乏、地下水充足的地区，大抓掏泉挖井，引水灌溉。可用机械灌溉的五大坪部分地区，集中优势力量一面修理机具，一面掏挖进水池、引水渠、平整土地、加固渠道，经济用水，尽量扩大灌溉面积。在干旱山塬地区主要整修窖窑，以备冬季积冰积雪。
