Xinhua News Agency, Sydney. The Australian "Tribune" weekly recently commented on the US election, saying that the election result was simply one tool of monopoly capital replacing another "equally docile tool."

The weekly said that undoubtedly, the majority of the American people oppose exploitation, the Cold War, and brinkmanship, but the election does not allow them to freely and clearly express their wishes.

The weekly said that the only choice offered to them was a choice between tweedledum and tweedledee.

The "Tribune" weekly said that any illusion that Kennedy's victory foreshadows any fundamental change in American policy has been shattered by Kennedy's first press conference after his victory, because he indicated that the main domestic and foreign espionage chiefs, Allen Dulles and Hoover, would remain in office.

The "Tribune" weekly said that just as Kennedy was telling reporters that he would continue America's policy of striving for freedom, police in the Deep South arrested and detained hundreds of black people. It said that Kennedy avoided directly answering questions about foreign policy, but he did indicate that he still believed in the policy of strength. The weekly said that it is clear from all the facts that one cannot expect a positive transformation in the United States simply because of a change in the occupant of the White House; such a positive transformation can only come as a result of the American people's mass struggles.

    澳“论坛”周报说美国大选不反映人民愿望
    肯尼迪仍然迷信实力政策
    新华社悉尼电　澳大利亚“论坛”周报最近在评论美国大选时说，选举结果只是垄断资本的一个工具代替了另一个“同样驯服的工具”。
    这家周报说，毫无疑问，大多数美国人民反对剥削、冷战和边缘政策，但是选举不容许他们自由和清楚地表示他们的愿望。
    周报说，向他们提供的唯一选择是在半斤八两之间的选择。
      “论坛”周报说，认为肯尼迪的胜利预示着美国政策会有任何根本改变的任何幻想已经被肯尼迪在胜利后举行的第一次记者招待会上打破了，因为他表明，主要的对内和对外间谍头子艾伦·杜勒斯和胡佛将留任。
      “论坛”周报说，正当肯尼迪对记者们说他将继续美国的争取自由的政策的时候，在大南方的警察逮捕和拘禁了数以百计的黑人。它说，肯尼迪避不直接答复关于外交政策的问题，但是他的确表明他仍然迷信实力地位政策。这家周报说，从一切事实可以清楚看出，不能够单单由于白宫主人的改变而期望美国会有好的转变，只有作为美国人民进行群众斗争的结果才会有这种好的转变。
