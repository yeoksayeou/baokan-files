    The Old Red Flag Shines Again
    The Story of the Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, Converter Workshop, Working Together to Protect the Red Flag
    By our reporter Zhou Yongkang

    "The First Converter Workshop has also completed its plan!" On the morning of October 1st, the workers of the First Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 had just delivered a large red announcement of overfulfilling the September production plan to the plant's Party Committee. The news quickly spread, and countless people in the plant were happy for them! This news was so inspiring because it contained a tortuous story.

    The Inspiration of a "Good Neighbor"

    More than two months ago, one afternoon, the Open Hearth Furnace Workshop next to the First Converter Workshop, because it had re-raised the red flag of the national small open-hearth furnaces, all the workshops and departments of the plant went to congratulate them with gongs and drums. The workers of the First Converter Workshop sat at the door after congratulating them. Lu Fengyao, the Party Branch Secretary of the workshop, saw several workers sitting there silently and asked, "What are you thinking about?"

    Ding Qinghe and several old workers immediately surrounded Lu Fengyao and pointed to the two high chimneys of the adjacent Open Hearth Furnace Workshop, saying excitedly, "Secretary Lu, their Open Hearth Furnace Workshop has recaptured the red flag they lost for more than two years. We lost the red flag. As long as the leadership says a word, even if the red flag flies to the end of the sky, we will chase it back."

    Lu Fengyao returned to the office, and the workers' words kept ringing in his ears.

    The First Converter Workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 was originally a famous red flag workshop in Shanghai. However, for more than a year, from the spring of last year to the present, production has not been able to rise. In the first seven months of this year, the plan was not completed.

    How could an excellent red flag workshop suddenly become like this? Lao Lu had also heard various opinions. Some said that the conversion of the converter from acidic to alkaline was a failure; others believed that there were too many new workers and their operating skills were not skilled. Lao Lu had thought about these opinions. Shanghai is not the only workshop using alkaline converters to make steel, and everyone uses the same raw materials now; and compared with the main converter workshops in Shanghai, we have fewer new workers!

    Lu Fengyao thought that the fundamental reason was still the cadres, still the leadership.

    The Eve of Liberation

    The next day, at a meeting of the plant's Party Committee, Lu Fengyao reported this matter to Chen Lin, the Deputy Secretary of the Plant's Party Committee, during the break. Chen Lin asked Lu Fengyao, "What do you think?"

    "The masses have a high enthusiasm for protecting the red flag. As long as we mobilize them, we are confident that we can raise the red flag again."

    Chen Lin suddenly remembered something, "On which day in 1958 was your workshop named one of the eight red flags in the city?"

    "August 15th." As soon as Lao Lu answered, both of them looked at the calendar on the wall.

    "The day after tomorrow is the second anniversary. I suggest you take out the articles from the Shanghai newspapers at that time introducing your advanced deeds, read them, recall the past, and compare them with today. It will be beneficial."

    This was really a good idea. Lu Fengyao found the articles that night.

    On the 15th, the atmosphere in the entire workshop changed greatly. Inside and outside the workshop, everywhere, groups of three or five were discussing the red flag. In the Party Branch office, the cadres were also discussing that article. Everyone read the past articles while discussing today's problems. At the end of the meeting, the Party Branch Secretary Lu Fengyao stood up and made a brief conclusion: "In the past, some people said that our workshop was backward due to objective difficulties. Now it seems that our cadres have not made enough subjective efforts; in the past, some people said that the workers' red flag concept was not strong, but in reality, our cadres do not have deep feelings for the red flag."

    Finally, Lu Fengyao said, "Don't just examine the past, let's talk about how to seize the red flag in the future!"

    As soon as they talked about seizing the red flag, the atmosphere suddenly became active.

    The workers said in unison: "Let's all fight for a breath, work harder, unite, and raise the red flag again." Later, someone summarized this sentence as "Four Ones": One breath, one energy, one heart, one flag.

    Cadres and Workers Cross the River Six Times

    The high tide of seizing the red flag was set off, and the workers of the three shifts chased after each other. However, the slow melting speed of the pig iron furnace was a common difficulty for the three shifts. Although the capacity of the pig iron furnace in the First Converter Workshop was larger than that of the converter, the pig iron furnace itself was far inferior to other converter workshops in Shanghai. A twelve-ton furnace can only produce ten tons of molten iron per hour. Sometimes, even opening three pig iron furnaces cannot meet the needs of the four converters. They had also sent people across the Huangpu River to the advanced factory, the No. 1 pig iron furnace of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3, to learn. In July alone, they went there four times. They went, but the pig iron furnace was still the same.

    "Why has the pig iron furnace's output been unable to rise?" The Party Branch handed this question to the masses and asked everyone to come up with ideas and find the reasons. One night, seven or eight pig iron furnace workers held a meeting in the changing room next to the workshop to specifically study this issue. A young worker was also holding a copy of the "Liberation Daily" and reading the experience of the No. 1 pig iron furnace of Plant No. 3 introduced in the newspaper.

    "It's not enough to just read, it's best to go to the site to see." A pig iron worker suggested.

    "It may not be useful to see it. Haven't we already been there four times? Going again is like drinking plain water." Some people disagreed.

    Seven or eight people, some advocating going again, some opposing, no one could convince anyone. At this time, the foreman Wang Wanzhong, who had been sitting aside for a long time without speaking and had been thinking deeply, stood up.

    "Don't quarrel, listen to Lao Wang's opinion." Someone shouted.

    Lao Wang said affirmatively: "We still have to learn. We have learned four times in the past, and the problem has not been solved. The problem is not with Plant No. 3, but with our thinking."

    These words convinced everyone. Because in the previous few studies, some people went with the attitude of "see and say." When they arrived at Plant No. 3, they only saw that the style of the No. 1 pig iron furnace of Plant No. 3 was good and the material yard was wide. Once, after returning, they even took advantage of the furnace's major repair to change the style of the pig iron furnace to be exactly the same as that of Plant No. 3, but as soon as the furnace was fired, the molten iron still melted very slowly.

    "Learning without humility, no matter how many times you run, it's useless!" The workers themselves came to this conclusion.

    "Go again, this time, we can't just take a fleeting glance, we have to operate."

    Under the unified leadership of the workshop, each of the three shifts selected five pig iron workers and crossed the river for the fifth time to learn. This time it was very different. Fifteen workers put on their work clothes and followed the shifts to study day and night in three shifts. During the study, soldiers were matched with soldiers, generals were matched with generals. Everyone closely followed the workers of the No. 1 furnace of Plant No. 3, staying close to them, carefully observing while operating, and taking out their notebooks to make notes whenever they had time.

    After studying for three days, everyone returned fully loaded. On the ferry across the Huangpu River, someone said again: "The experience of Plant No. 3 is not just operational technical experience, they also have many good experiences such as politically going to the furnace front and mobilizing the masses. It would be great if the cadres could also learn these experiences. Their learning for one hour is more effective than our learning for one day."

    When these words reached the Party Branch Secretary Lu Fengyao, Lao Lu immediately felt that it made sense, and immediately organized a group of workshop directors and chief foremen to cross the river for the sixth time. After the cadres returned, political work went to the furnace front, and the face of the pig iron furnace underwent tremendous changes. The melting rate in September increased by more than 20% compared with the average in the first half of the year. Now the molten iron from the three pig iron furnaces is sometimes more than enough to deal with five converters.

    Raising the Red Flag Again

    On the morning of October 7th, Class C was the early shift. As soon as they started work, production was very normal. The No. 2 converter was in its "prime", producing a furnace of steel in less than 20 minutes, and the progress was very fast.

    Once, the steel in the furnace had just been discharged, and the workers were preparing to pour a package of molten iron sent from the pig iron furnace into the converter. Unexpectedly, the No. 1 converter next door also happened to be discharging steel. The overhead crane worker didn't know who to give this package of molten iron to, and the ground crane worker thought: In principle, it should be given to the No. 2 converter, but the No. 1 converter is an old furnace with a higher output. From the perspective of the entire shift, it can be given to the No. 1 furnace first. Just as the crane worker was in trouble, the No. 2 furnace foreman Sun Tingyu ran over: "We can wait a while, give this package of molten iron to the No. 1 furnace first." Since this was the case, the crane worker raised his hand and directed the crane to send the molten iron to the No. 1 converter. However, the No. 1 furnace foreman Wang Zhaoguo also rushed over: "The No. 2 furnace discharged steel first, they should use it first." In the end, for the sake of the entire shift's high yield, the molten iron was given to the No. 1 furnace. The pig iron furnace workers saw that the No. 2 furnace workers had a high style, and immediately tried to send them a package of molten iron. As a result, Class C set a new record of 203 tons of shift production that day.

    Class C took the lead, and Class A closely followed. After six hours of battle, 180 tons of steel were produced. Seeing the situation, it was not a big problem to surpass Class C. At this time, Pan Changrong, the deputy director on duty, discovered that several converters were "old" and might collapse during the shift handover. If the converter was not replaced during this shift and the workers of Class B were allowed to replace it, their output would be greatly affected.

    "Everyone pay attention, before we get off work, we must replace the No. 4 furnace so that Class B can have a high output as soon as they start work." Pan Changrong commanded everyone to prepare to replace the furnace in front of the amplifier.

    "The output of the No. 4 furnace is very high, and it has to be replaced in more than an hour. I'm afraid there won't be enough time! And we have to catch up with Class C today." Some people were worried that replacing the furnace would affect the production of this shift and discussed it below.

    Communist Party member Ji Youfa stood up chest out: "We can't just consider ourselves. Everyone is for steel. Those who are not afraid of difficulties, follow me..." Before he finished speaking, Communist Youth League member Chen Zhiming and several young men immediately responded, and several people braved the high temperature after steel was produced to remove the residue in the furnace pit. In less than an hour, they replaced the No. 4 converter, shortening the time by about half compared to the past. While accelerating the furnace replacement, the steelmaking workers in front of the furnace also seized every minute and second, shortening the blowing time of each furnace of steel. As a result, after the furnace was replaced, the shift output still refreshed the record of the previous shift with a new record of 212 tons. Then, Class B created an even higher record of 213 tons because the workers of Class A created high-yield conditions for them. The three shifts were all red, breaking through the 600-ton mark and creating the highest record of steel output in one day and night in more than a year.

    After two months of hard work, this old red flag of the First Converter Workshop continued to advance with high strides and released new brilliance. Although the action in August was late, the steel output increased by 23.26% compared with the average output in the first seven months. They started to work hard at the beginning of September, and it increased by more than 30% compared with August, and completed the plan for the first month since the beginning of this year. But the workers were not satisfied, and the steel output in October was more than 11% higher than in September, becoming one of the steel workshops with the largest increase in steel output among the ten major steelmaking workshops in Shanghai. This year, the workers looked at the six large characters "Forever Preserve the Red Flag Workshop" at the entrance of the workshop and issued a victorious smile.

    老红旗重放光芒
    上钢一厂一转炉车间群策群力保红旗的故事
    本报记者　周永康
    “第一转炉车间也完成计划啦！”10月1日早晨，上钢一厂第一转炉车间的工人刚把一张超额完成9月份生产计划的大红喜报，送给厂党委会，这个消息很快就传开了，听到这个喜讯，厂里不知道有多少人在为他们高兴啊！这个消息所以这样鼓舞人心，里面有着一个曲折的故事。
    “好邻居”的启示
    两个多月前的一个下午，第一转炉车间旁边的平炉车间，因为重新举起了全国小型平炉的红旗，全厂各个车间、科室都纷纷敲锣打鼓前去祝贺。第一转炉车间工人们贺喜回来坐在门口，车间党总支书记卢凤尧看见好几个工人都一声不响地坐在那里就问道：“你们在想什么？”
    丁庆和等几个老工人马上把卢凤尧围了起来，指指隔壁平炉车间的两个高烟囱，激动地说：“卢书记，他们平炉车间把丢了两年多的红旗重新夺回，我们丢了红旗，只要领导上说一句话，红旗就是飞到天边，我们也要追回来。”
    卢凤尧回到办公室，工人们的话一直在他耳边响着。
    上钢一厂第一转炉车间原来是上海闻名的红旗车间。可是从去年春天开始到现在的一年多时间内，生产一直上不去。今年头七个月，都没有完成计划。
    一个出色的红旗车间，怎么会一下子变成这个样子呢？老卢也听到过各种各样的说法。有的说，转炉酸性改为碱性改坏了；有的认为，新工人太多了，操作技术不熟练。这些意见老卢都想过。用碱性转炉炼钢，上海又不光是自己一个车间，用的原料现在谁都一样；新工人吧，和上海几个主要转炉车间比较起来，自己还算是少的哩！
    卢凤尧想到最后，觉得根本的原因还在干部，还在领导。
    翻身前夜
    第二天，厂党委开会，休息的时候，卢凤尧把这件事情向厂党委副书记陈林作了汇报。陈林问卢凤尧：“你是怎么看的？”
    “群众保红旗热情很高，只要发动一下，再举红旗是有把握的。”
    陈林忽然想起一件事：“你们车间在1958年哪一天评为全市八面红旗之一的？”
    “8月15日。”老卢一回答，两个人都向墙上的日历望了一下。
    “后天正好是两周年，我建议你们把当时上海各报介绍你们先进事迹的文章，拿出来读一读，回忆一下过去，对比一下今天，会有好处。”
    这真是一个好主意。卢凤尧当夜把文章翻了出来。
    15日这一天，整个车间空气大变。车间内外，到处三五成群，在议论着红旗。党总支办公室里，干部们也在讨论那篇文章。大家一边读过去的文章，一边谈今天的问题。会议结束的时候，总支书记卢凤尧站起来作了一个简短的结论：“过去有人说我们车间落后，是客观困难造成的，现在看来是我们干部主观努力不够；以前有人说工人的红旗观念不强，实际上是我们干部对红旗的感情不深。”
    最后，卢凤尧说：“不要光检查过去了，还是谈谈今后怎样夺红旗吧！”
    一谈到夺红旗，空气顿时活跃了起来。
    工人们异口同声地说：“大家争口气，加把劲，团结起来，把红旗再举起来。”后来不知谁又把这句话归纳为“四个一”：一口气、一股劲、一条心、一面旗。
    干部工人六次过江
    夺红旗的高潮掀起来了，三班的工人你追我赶。可是化铁炉溶化速度慢，是三个班的共同困难。第一转炉车间虽然化铁炉能力比转炉大，可是化铁炉的本身远远不如上海其他转炉车间。十二吨的炉子，一个钟头，只能出十吨铁水。有时开三只化铁炉，还满足不了四只转炉的需要。他们也曾经派人渡过黄浦江到先进工厂上钢三厂一号化铁炉去学习过，仅7月份一个月，他们就先后去了四次。去是去了，化铁炉还是老样子。
    “为什么化铁炉产量一直上不去？”党总支把这个问题交给了群众，叫大家出主意找原因。一天晚上，七、八个化铁炉工人在车间旁边的更衣室里，开会专门研究这个问题。一个青年工人手里还拿着一份“解放日报”，在读报上介绍的三厂一号化铁炉的经验。
    “光读不行，最好到现场去看看。”一个化铁工建议。
    “看也未必有用，我们不是已经去过四次了吗。再去也等于吃白开水。”也有人不同意。
    七、八个人，有的主张再去，有的表示反对，谁也说服不了谁。这时坐在一旁半天没有发言、一直在深思中的工长汪万忠站了起来。
    “不要吵，听听老汪的意见。”有人喊道。
    老汪肯定地说：“还要去学。过去学了四次，没解决问题，毛病不在三厂，而在我们思想上有毛病”。
    这几句话说得大家口服又心服。因为前几次学习，有的人就抱着“看看再说”的态度去的。到了三厂，只看到三厂一号化铁炉式样好、料场宽。有一次回来，还趁炉子大修，把化铁炉的式样改得和三厂的完全一样，可是炉子一升火，铁水仍然溶化得很慢。
    “不虚心的学习，跑得次数再多，也没有用呀！”工人们自己得出了这样的结论。
    “再去，这次去，不能走马看花，要下马操作。”
    在车间的统一领导下，三个班各抽出五个化铁工，第五次过江去取经了。这一次大不相同，十五个工人大家穿上操作服，分日夜三班，跟班学习。学习时，兵对兵，将对将，大家紧紧盯住三厂一号炉工人，寸步不离，一边操作，一边仔细观察，一有空就掏出本子做记录。
    学了三天，大家满载而归。在黄浦江的摆渡轮上，有人却又说了一句话：“三厂的经验，也不单是操作技术经验，他们还有政治上炉前，发动群众等许多好经验。这些经验，干部们也来学学多好，他们学一个钟头，比我们学一天的作用还大。”
    这句话传到总支书记卢凤尧那里，老卢一听有道理，又马上组织一批车间主任，总工长，第六次过江。干部们回来以后，政治工作上了炉前，化铁炉的面貌发生了巨大的变化。9月份的溶化率比上半年平均提高了20％多，现在三个化铁炉的铁水有时对付五个转炉还有余。
    再次高举红旗
    10月7日早晨，丙班是早班，一上班生产就很正常，二号转炉正在“壮年”，不到二十分钟就出一炉钢，进度很快。
    一次，炉子上钢水刚刚放完，工人们正准备把化铁炉上送来的一包铁水倒进转炉去。不料，隔壁一号转炉也刚好放钢。顶上行车工人不知这包铁水给谁才好，地上的领行车的工人想：按理应该给二号转炉，不过一号转炉是老炉子，产量较高，从整个班来看，可以先给一号炉。领行车工人正在为难，二号炉炉长孙廷雨跑了过来：“我们可以等一等，这包铁水先给一号炉。”既然如此，领行车工人就举手，指挥行车把铁水送给一号转炉。但是一号炉炉长王兆国也赶了过来：“二号炉先放钢，应该他们先用。”最后，为了全班高产，还是把铁水给了一号炉。化铁炉工人看到二号炉工人风格高，马上设法给他们也送来了一包铁水。结果丙班这一天又创造了班产二百零三吨的新纪录。
    丙班一马当先，甲班紧紧跟上。经过前六小时的战斗，出了一百八十吨钢，看情况超过丙班问题不大。这时候，值班副主任潘长荣发现有几个转炉“老了”，可能在交接班时会垮下来，如果不在本班上把转炉换好，让下面乙班工人去换，他们的产量就会大受影响。
    “大家注意，我们在下班以前，一定要把四号炉子换好，好让乙班一上班就高产。”潘长荣在扩大器面前指挥大家准备换炉。
    “四号炉产量很高，而且要在一个多小时内换好，时间怕来不及吧！而且今天还要赶丙班。”有人担心换炉子会影响本班生产，在下面纷纷议论着。
    共产党员吉友发挺胸而出：“我们不能光考虑自己。大家都是为了钢。不怕困难的跟我来……”话音未落，共青团员陈志明几个小伙子立即响应，几个人冒着出钢后的高温，抢除炉坑里的残渣。在不到一个小时内，他们就把四号转炉换好，时间比过去缩短了一半左右。在加速换炉时，炉前炼钢工人也抓紧一分一秒，缩短每炉钢的吹炼时间，结果炉子换好，班产量仍以二百一十二吨这个新纪录，刷新了上一班的纪录。接着，乙班就因为甲班工人给他们创造了高产条件，又创造了二百一十三吨的更高纪录。三班满堂红，冲出六百吨大关，创造了一年多来一昼夜钢产量的最高纪录。
    两个月的苦战，第一转炉车间这面老红旗，又继续高歌猛进，放出了新的光芒。8月份动手虽晚，可是钢的产量比前七个月的平均产量提高了23.26％。9月份一开始就抓紧，又比8月份提高了30％多，今年以来，第一个月完成了计划。但工人们并不满足，10月份的钢产量又比9月份提高了11％以上，成为上海十个主要炼钢车间中，钢产量上升幅度最大的车间之一。今年，工人们望着车间门口“永保红旗车间”这六个大字，发出了胜利的微笑。
