    Oil Mine Workers Vigorously Support Agricultural Construction
    (Our report) The Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau's various units are actively supporting agricultural technological transformation.
    Since the beginning of this year, under the education of the principle of taking agriculture as the foundation, the Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau's employees have regarded supporting agriculture as an important task. The Administration Bureau and its affiliated companies, factories, and offices have all established "Support Agriculture Offices," and have transferred more than one hundred outstanding technicians and technical cadres to form "Support Agriculture Work Teams." Carrying tools and materials, they have gone deep into Jiuquan City, Anxi County, and the suburbs of Yumen City, repairing and reforming more than five thousand sets of tools for the communes. This spring, when the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Instructions on the Emergency Mobilization of the Whole Party and the Whole People to Carry Out the Drought Prevention and Drought Resistance Movement," the Bureau immediately dispatched three drilling teams to drill eleven water wells for the Chijin People's Commune, with a daily water production of 9,000 to 15,000 tons, irrigating an area of more than 100 mu. At the same time, it sent a hydrological survey team to the mountainous area to survey water sources, solving the water problem for some crops. In addition, it also supported the Yumen Town Commune and the Changma Commune with a batch of urgently needed agricultural machinery such as diesel engines and lathes. The Exploration Company, the Machinery Factory, and the Hydropower Plant established the first power station for the Changma People's Commune. The Oil Construction Company supported the People's Communes in Gaotai and Anxi counties, which have ties with them, with more than one thousand pieces of various agricultural tools and machinery parts, and cultivated 1,075 mu of land on behalf of the Yumen Town Commune. The Refinery supported the Changma People's Commune with more than 90,000 kilograms of oil products and more than 4,000 kilograms of pesticides.
    The Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau's various units have adopted two methods, "delivering to the door" and "inviting to the door," to impart technology to farmers. On the one hand, they send experienced technicians to the countryside to help communes run training classes and organize mobile service lecture groups to give technical lessons according to local conditions; on the other hand, they invite farmers to come to the factory and adopt the method of "master teaching apprentice" to help farmers learn technology. By adopting these two methods, various units have trained 254 technical workers for the communes, including mechanics, lathe operators, fitters, and tractor drivers.
    The Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau's vigorous support for agriculture in carrying out technological transformation has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers in the suburbs of Yumen City and neighboring counties (cities). The vast number of farmers are determined to achieve a greater leap forward on the agricultural front, produce more agricultural and sideline products, and support the great leap forward in industry.

    油矿职工大力支援农业建设
    本报讯　玉门石油管理局各单位积极支援农业技术改造。
    今年以来，玉门石油管理局职工在以农业为基础的方针的教育下，把支援农业看做一项重要的任务。管理局及所属各公司、厂、处都设立了支援农业办公室，抽调了一百多名优秀的技术工人和技术干部，组成“支援农业工作队”，带着工具和材料，分别深入酒泉市、安西县和玉门市郊区，为公社修复和改革工具五千多套。今春，当中共甘肃省委发出“全党全民紧急动员开展防旱抗旱运动的指示”以后，该局立即派出三个钻井队，为赤金人民公社打水井十一口，日产水量九千至一万五千吨，灌溉面积达一百多亩，同时派出水文勘测队到山区勘测水源，解决了部分农作物的用水问题。另外，还支援玉门镇公社和昌马公社柴油机、车床等一批农村急需的机械。勘探公司、机械厂、水电厂等单位为昌马人民公社建立了第一座电站。油建公司支援了与自己有挂钩关系的高台、安西等县人民公社各种农具和机械配件一千多件，并为玉门镇公社代耕土地一千零七十五亩。炼油厂支援了昌马人民公社等方面油产品九万多公斤，杀虫药剂四千多斤。
    玉门石油管理局各单位采取送上门和请上门两种办法，给农民传授技术，一方面派有经验的技术人员到农村帮助公社举办训练班，组织流动服务讲课组，因地制宜讲技术课；一方面邀请农民上门，在工厂采取师傅带徒弟的方法帮助农民学习技术。各单位采取这两种办法，已经为公社培训了机修工、车工、钳工、拖拉机司机等技术工人二百五十四人。
    玉门石油管理局大力支援农业进行技术改造的行动，大大鼓舞了玉门市郊区及邻近县（市）广大农民的生产积极性。广大农民决心在农业战线实现更大的跃进，生产更多的农副产品，支援工业大跃进。（附图片）
