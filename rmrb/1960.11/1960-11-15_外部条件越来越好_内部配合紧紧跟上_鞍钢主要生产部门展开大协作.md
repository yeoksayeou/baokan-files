    External conditions are getting better; internal coordination is keeping up closely.
    Anshan Iron and Steel's major production departments launch large-scale cooperation.
    (According to the Liaoning Daily) The rapid steelmaking campaign at Anshan Iron and Steel has attracted workers from all fronts, including mining, sintering, ironmaking, coking, machinery repair, transportation, and power, all of whom are taking various measures to serve rapid steelmaking from all aspects.
    The workers in the production of raw materials mines, who are determined to be the vanguard of the rapid steelmaking campaign, launched an unprecedented scale of communist cooperation in order to prepare sufficient "grain and grass" for the open hearth furnaces. Mining, sintering, and coking workers launched a "one-dragon" production cooperation competition with ironmaking workers to ensure that the blast furnaces were well-fed and well-nourished. The sintering plant launched a large-scale joint problem-solving performance competition. In just over ten days, they overcame more than a hundred key problems, not only supplying the blast furnaces with an additional four to five hundred tons of concentrate every day but also increasing the grade of the concentrate by about 3%. Workers from the Dagushan, Dong'anshan, Gongchangling, and Yingtaoyuan iron mines, encouraged by the slogan "Step up production and produce more ore to support open hearth furnaces and make more steel," increased iron ore production by more than 9% compared to the past. Coking workers at the Chemical Plant, in addition to implementing measures such as coal washing and dewatering, and coke grading and screening, also made many important improvements in coal blending and fire regulation, increasing the lump coke rate from 92% to 93.6%, and producing more than 30,000 tons more of high-quality coke in October than in September. The ironmaking workers who directly control the blast furnaces launched a high-temperature, high-wind, heavy-load competition with the theme of producing more and better iron to support steelmaking, providing open hearth furnaces with more than 700 tons more of high-quality pig iron per day in October than in September.
    At the beginning of the rapid steelmaking campaign, the workers of the Transportation Department launched a mass movement of high-transport, high-security, and high-yield. Focusing on the key problem of poor line quality, the track maintenance workers worked hard for two days, solving the key problems of sixty-eight kilometers of lines, replacing more than two thousand rotten sleepers, reinforcing more than forty roadbeds, repairing more than seven hundred and seventy sets of turnouts, and clearing more than four thousand cubic meters of waste, making the quality of the main lines in the plant meet the standard, creating favorable conditions for safe driving. The loading and unloading workers made full use of twenty-four advanced loading and unloading tools, such as effective monorail cars, double-rail cars, Leap Forward cars, and electric scrapers, increasing the efficiency of loading and unloading by more than 30%, achieving the goal of unloading heavy cars as soon as they arrive and loading empty cars as soon as they arrive. With the widespread development of the rapid steelmaking campaign, the power load is getting heavier and heavier. In order to ensure safe power supply, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Power Supply Plant carried out a large-scale safety inspection, solving more than 1,700 equipment defects and avoiding more than 80 power outages, while actively implementing the major measure of ring power supply. In this way, not only did they supply 5% more power to the steelmaking open hearth furnaces in October than in September, but they also achieved safety without accidents. The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Water Supply Plant also actively adjusted the waterway network and increased the pressure, so that the upper and lower waterways of the open hearth furnace production were unimpeded.
    The goal of everything for rapid steelmaking has further mobilized the enthusiasm of the machine repair departments and auxiliary departments. They put forward the slogan "Deliver convenience to the furnace front, bring difficulties back," and generally formed "three-way combination" visiting groups with the participation of factory directors, technicians, and veteran workers, visiting the three major steel plants to understand the needs and meet the needs. The "three-way combination" visiting group headed by the factory director of the Northern Machinery Repair Plant visited the three major steel plants eighteen times and adopted the method of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles, completing the key spare parts manufacturing task in October four days ahead of schedule. After visiting door-to-door, the workers of the Electrical Repair Plant extensively carried out the "Top-notch Electrical Equipment for Three Steels and One Iron" and "Door-to-door Delivery" activities, not only increasing the monthly processing capacity from 160,000 pieces to 200,000 pieces but also achieving the goal of solving problems on-site and delivering goods to the door. Thanks to the active participation of the workers of the machine repair and auxiliary departments in fighting for steel, the production efficiency continued to improve, and the key spare parts completed in October to seize steel increased by more than 30% compared to September.
    At the same time, the refractory material workers are also improving product quality and increasing output. They worked together to tackle key production problems, focusing on key links such as raw materials, formulas, particle size, mixing, forming, and firing, so that product quality improved steadily. The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Refractory Material Plant implemented the "three fixings and three good" operation method of fixing the quality of raw materials, fixing the particle size, fixing the formula, and mixing well, forming well, and firing well, so that the first-class rate of magnesia bricks increased from 80.5% to 93.3%, and the first-class rate of open hearth furnace roof bricks soared from 60% to more than 94%. The workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine focused on the production of first-class raw materials, strictly implemented the thermal engineering system, strengthened the selection of finished products, and implemented the method of block-by-block calipers, so that the finished product rate of magnesia bricks exceeded the planned target, and the finished product rate of open hearth furnace roof bricks reached 92.17%, 2.17% higher than the planned target.

    外部条件越来越好　内部配合紧紧跟上
    鞍钢主要生产部门展开大协作
    本报讯　据辽宁日报消息：鞍钢的快速炼钢运动，吸引了从采矿、烧结、炼铁、炼焦、机修、运输到动力等各个战线的广大职工，都在采取各种措施，从各方面为快速炼钢服务。
    誓做快速炼钢运动急先锋的各生产原料厂矿的工人，为了给平炉备足“粮草”，在快速炼钢一开始，便开展了空前规模的共产主义大协作。采矿、烧结和炼焦职工为了保证高炉吃饱、吃好和炼铁职工开展了“一条龙”生产大协作竞赛。烧结总厂展开了声势浩大的联合攻关表演赛，十几天工夫，就攻克了大小关键百余项，不仅每天多供应高炉四五百吨精矿，还使精矿的品位提高了3％左右。大孤山、东鞍山、弓长岭、樱桃园铁矿职工，也在“加紧生产多出矿，支援平炉多炼钢”的口号鼓舞下，使铁矿石产量比过去提高9％以上。化工总厂炼焦工人，除了实行洗煤脱水、焦炭分级过筛等措施外，在配煤、调火等方面也都作了许多重要的改进，使块焦率由92％提高到93.6％，10月份比9月份多生产优质焦炭三万多吨。直接掌握高炉的炼铁工人，掀起了以多产好铁支援炼钢为内容的高温、大风、重负荷的竞赛，10月份比9月份每天多供给平炉七百多吨优质生铁。
    运输部职工在快速炼钢运动一开始，就掀起了热火朝天的高运保高产的群众运动。养路工人针对线路质量差的关键，大干两天，解决了六十八公里线路的关键问题，更换了二千多根腐朽枕木，加固了四十多处路基，修理了七百七十多组道岔，清理了四千多立方米废物，使厂内主要线路质量都达到了标准线，为安全行驶创造了有利条件。装卸工人充分运用行之有效的单轨车、双轨车、跃进车、电动拉铲等二十四种先进装卸工具，使装卸车效率提高30％以上，作到了重车随来随卸，空车随来随装。随着快速炼钢运动的广泛开展，电力负荷越来越大，鞍钢供电厂职工为了保证安全供电，一边进行安全大检查，解决了一千七百多件设备缺陷，避免了八十多次停电事故，一边积极实现环形供电的重大措施。这样，10月份不仅比9月份多供给炼钢平炉5％的电力，而且作到了安全无事故。鞍钢给水厂的职工也积极调整水道管网，增加压力，使平炉生产的上下水道畅通无阻。
    一切为了快速炼钢的目标，又把机修部门、辅助部门职工的积极性进一步调动起来。他们提出了“方便送到炉前，困难带了回来”的口号，普遍组成了有厂长、技术员、老工人参加的“三结合”访问团，遍访三大钢厂，了解需要，满足需要。北部机修厂以厂长为首的“三结合”访问团，先后到三大钢厂访问了十八次，采取了集中优势兵力打歼灭战的办法，使10月份的关键备品制造任务提前四天完成。电修厂职工登门访问之后，广泛开展了“三钢一铁电气设备天字号”和“送上门”的活动，不仅使月加工能力从十六万件提高到二十万件，还作到了解决问题上门、送货上门。由于各机修、辅助部门职工积极为钢而战，生产效率不断提高，10月份完成的夺钢关键备品比9月份增长30％以上。
    在这同时，耐火材料工人也在改进产品质量提高产量。他们齐心协力攻打生产关键，狠抓原料、配方、粒度、混拌、成型、烧成等关键性环节，使产品质量节节提高。鞍钢耐火材料厂的职工，实行了定原料的质量、定粒度、定配方和混拌好、成型好、烧成好的“三定三好”操作法，使镁砖一级品率由80.5％提高到93.3％，平炉顶砖一级品率由60％猛增到94％以上。鞍钢大石桥镁矿职工狠抓一级品原料生产，严格执行热工制度，加强成品拣选，实行块块卡尺的办法，使镁砖成品率超过计划指标，平炉顶砖成品率达到92.17％，高出计划指标2.17％。
