　　How to Manage Wheat Fields: Everyone Contributes Ideas
　　Pingxifu Brigade Cadres and Commune Members Pool Their Wisdom to Quickly Irrigate and Apply More Fertilizer to Wheat
　　Nanguan Brigade Mobilizes Commune Members to Find Experience, Formulate Measures, and Conduct Wheat Field Management Competitions

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The commune members of Pingxifu Production Brigade of Shahe People's Commune, Changping County, Beijing Municipality, are taking practical actions of "two quicks and one more"—quickly rolling the wheat, quickly irrigating, and applying more fertilizer—to strengthen winter management of wheat.

　　What are the benefits of rolling wheat before winter? When is it appropriate to irrigate for frost protection? When is the best time to apply fertilizer? The brigade party branch convened production team cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to specifically discuss these issues. At the meeting, everyone shared their experiences, presented situations, and offered ideas. Liu Shuhua, the wheat professional team leader, meticulously introduced their experience of achieving a bumper harvest last year by strengthening wheat winter management. Last year, they planted 100 mu of high-yield wheat fields. After the beginning of winter, they promptly irrigated the wheat fields for frost protection and applied fertilizer in conjunction with irrigation; after the wheat took root, they rolled the fields once. As a result, the yield per mu was about twice as high as that of wheat fields that were not irrigated for frost protection, not fertilized, and not rolled. He also used specific examples to prove that rolling wheat before winter can prevent drought, cold, and excessive growth of wheat seedlings, which is beneficial for wheat to safely overwinter. Bai Dequan, an experienced wheat grower, cited several years of facts to illustrate that wheat fields that are rolled, irrigated, and fertilized in a timely manner before winter will achieve high yields in the coming year. Technicians further introduced the scientific principles and some technical measures for achieving high yields by strengthening wheat winter management. After full discussion, everyone agreed that it is necessary to seize the agricultural season and quickly roll the wheat, quickly irrigate, and apply more fertilizer.

　　With a direction for strengthening management, the brigade party branch organized production team cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians to go deep into the wheat fields and adopt the method of watching and discussing to determine, according to the terrain, geology, and wheat seedling growth, which wheat fields should be irrigated, when to irrigate, which wheat fields should be fertilized, how much fertilizer to apply, which wheat fields should be rolled early, and which wheat fields can be rolled later.

　　After formulating wheat field winter management measures in accordance with local conditions, they organized twenty-eight wheat management professional teams with the production team as the unit, led by the production team's party branch secretary, with experienced farmers and technicians as consultants and technical guidance. Each professional team, according to the specific situation, divided the team members into several groups, assigning specific tasks and areas of responsibility, implementing methods of setting tasks, setting time limits, setting quality standards, setting remuneration, and rewarding over-fulfillment, and launched a warm wheat field management competition. The results of each group are announced daily, and experiences are exchanged in a timely manner, with everyone catching up with each other. According to current statistics, all wheat fields have been rolled once, creating favorable conditions for irrigating for frost protection. The people participating in irrigation and fertilization adopted the method of joint operation of several processes, such as transporting fertilizer, applying fertilizer, and checking water sources, checking channels, and watching furrow openings, greatly accelerating the progress of the work. Several hundred mu of wheat fields that needed to be fertilized early have been top-dressed with high-quality fertilizer; more than two thousand mu of wheat fields on dry and high ground have been irrigated for frost protection in advance. At present, each production team is adding manpower and machinery, striving to complete the tasks of irrigating and fertilizing before "Minor Snow".

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Nanguan Brigade of Chengguan People's Commune, Zaozhuang City, Shandong Province, after further implementing the "three contracts and one reward" policy, greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of small teams and commune members, and the entire team enthusiastically launched a wheat seedling stage management competition.

　　After the small teams of this brigade signed the wheat "three contracts" contract, they also mobilized commune members to compare specific facts and summarize the experience of early wheat management in previous years. For example, the Wangfuzhuang small team had 294 mu of wheat last year, and immediately strengthened management in all aspects after sowing. This year, the average yield per mu reached 216 jin, exceeding the contract production target and receiving a reward; the Caozhuang small team had 660 mu of wheat, and the soil conditions and sowing time were roughly the same as Wangfuzhuang. Due to the relaxation of early management, the yield per mu was 167 jin, failing to complete the contract production plan and being penalized. In the summary, the commune members also compared the different experiences in wheat growth and yield under the same conditions, such as irrigating with sealing frozen water versus not irrigating, fertilizing versus not fertilizing, rolling versus not rolling, and coarse management versus fine management, realizing the benefits of early management and the harms of late management.

　　Therefore, each small team formulated measures for exceeding the contract production plan and early wheat management based on their own production conditions: timely checking and replanting seedlings, timely rolling, spreading a layer of miscellaneous soil fertilizer before freezing, and irrigating with sealing frozen water to promote wheat to take good roots and strengthen the base. On this basis, a "four catch-up" (catching up late with early, catching up distant land with nearby land, catching up general fields with high-yield fields, catching up thin land with fertile land) and "four surpass" (enthusiasm surpasses measures, measures surpass indicators, this winter's wheat seedlings surpass last winter's, actual output surpasses contract output) wheat field management competition centered on realizing the contract production plan was launched between small teams, between work groups, and between individuals. The Caozhuang small team, which was penalized for reduced wheat production this summer, took the initiative to propose to the Leiyuan small team, which was rewarded for overproduction, to compete in management, enthusiasm, and measures this year, and to compete in output and rewards next year. The Wangfuzhuang small team, which was rewarded for overproduction of wheat this summer, has even greater enthusiasm, and has universally top-dressed the 48 mu of late-sown wheat with fertilizer once.

　　At present, the entire brigade has checked and replanted all the wheat that has emerged from the soil, applied fertilizer to 350 mu, and repaired more than 190 field canals. (Attached picture)
　　
　　After the wheat emerged from the soil, the members of the Dongxing Production Team of Xiaozhai Commune in Hengshui County, Hebei Province, sprayed 666 pesticide powder as early as possible to prevent pests such as autumn locusts from harming wheat seedlings.

    麦田如何管　大家献计谋
    平西府大队干部社员群策群力给小麦快浇水多追肥
    南关大队发动社员找经验订措施开展麦田管理竞赛
    本报讯　北京市昌平县沙河人民公社平西府生产大队的社员们，正以快轧麦、快浇水、多追肥的“两快一多”的实际行动，加强小麦越冬管理。
    冬前轧麦有哪些好处？什么时候浇冻水合适？什么时候追肥最好？大队党总支曾召集生产队干部、老农、技术员，专门座谈了这些问题。会上大家谈经验，摆情况，献计谋。小麦专业队长刘树华，细致地介绍了他们去年加强小麦越冬管理获得丰产的经验。去年他们播种了一百亩小麦丰产田，立冬后，及时给麦田浇了冻水，结合浇水追了肥；小麦盘根后，普轧一遍。结果，亩产量比没浇冻水、没追肥和没有镇轧的麦田高一倍左右。他又以具体事例，证明了冬前轧麦可以防旱、防寒和防止麦苗徒长，有利小麦安全过冬。种麦老手白德泉，举出几年的事实说明，凡是冬前及时镇轧、浇水、追肥的麦田，来年就获得高产。技术员们进一步介绍了加强小麦越冬管理获得丰产的科学道理和一些技术措施。经过充分商量，大家一致的意见是：要抓紧农时，快轧麦、快浇水、多追肥。
    有了加强管理的方向，大队党总支就组织生产队干部、老农、技术员一起深入麦田，采取边看边议的办法，针对地势地质和麦苗生长情况，分别确定哪块麦田该浇水、什么时候浇，哪块麦田该追肥、追多少，哪块麦田该提早轧、哪块麦田可推后轧。
    因地制宜地定出麦田越冬管理措施以后，他们以生产队为单位，组织起二十八个小麦管理专业队，由生产队的党支部书记挂帅，老农和技术员作顾问和技术指导。各专业队根据具体情况，把队员划分成几个小组，分片包活，实行定任务、定时间、定质量、定报酬和超额奖励办法，开展了热烈的麦田管理竞赛。每天公布各组成绩，及时交流经验，大家你追我赶。到目前统计，全部麦田已经普轧一遍，给浇冻水创造了有利条件。参加浇水、追肥的人，采取了运肥、追肥和查水源、查渠道、看畦口等几道工序联合作业的办法，大大加快了工作进度，几百亩需要及早追肥的麦田，已经追上了优质肥料；两千多亩高岗干旱地麦田，提前浇上了冻水。目前，各生产队又在增人添马，力争在“小雪”前完成浇水和追肥任务。
    本报讯　山东省枣庄市城关公社南关大队，经过进一步贯彻“三包一奖”政策，大大调动了小队和社员的积极性，全队热烈开展了小麦苗期管理竞赛。
    这个大队的各小队在签订了小麦“三包”合同后，还发动社员以具体事实对比，总结了往年及早管理小麦的经验。如王府庄小队去年有小麦二百九十四亩，播种后立即全面加强了管理，今年平均亩产达到二百一十六斤，超额完成包产指标，受到奖励；曹庄小队有小麦六百六十亩，与王府庄的土质条件和播种时间大致相同，由于放松了早期管理，亩产一百六十七斤，未完成包产计划，受了罚。在总结中，社员们还对比了在同等条件下，浇封冻水比不浇封冻水，追肥与不追肥，砘轧与不砘轧，粗管与细管，小麦的生长和产量的不同经验，认识了早管的好处和晚管的害处。
    于是，各小队均根据自己的生产条件，订出了超包产计划和小麦早期管理的措施：要及时查苗补苗，适时砘轧，封冻前普盖一遍土杂肥，普浇一遍封冻水，促使小麦扎好根，盘好墩。在此基础上，小队与小队、作业组与作业组、人与人之间，掀起了以实现超包产计划为中心的“四赶”（晚茬赶早茬、远地赶近地、一般田赶丰产田、薄地赶肥地）、“四超”（干劲超措施，措施超指标，今冬麦苗超去冬，实产超包产）的麦田管理竞赛。今年麦季减产受罚的曹庄小队，主动向超产受奖的雷园小队提出今年比管理、比干劲、比措施，明年比产量、比受奖的竞赛条件。今年夏季小麦超产受奖的王府庄小队干劲更大，四十八亩晚茬麦，又普遍追上了一次肥料。
    目前，全大队已将出土的小麦全部查补了一遍，追补肥料三百五十亩，整修田间渠道一百九十多条。（附图片）
    河北省衡水县小寨公社东兴生产队的社员们在小麦出土后，就及早喷射六六六药粉，预防秋蝗等虫害危害麦苗。
