Combining High Revolutionary Enthusiasm with a Realistic Approach
Yu Shundian Masters Timing and Local Conditions to Develop Mountainous Area Production

Comrade Yu Shundian, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Taiping Management District, Chengguan Commune, Yuan'an County, Hubei Province, is a good cadre adept at leading production.

The Taiping Management District is located on Taiping Mountain in the southeast of the county seat. Here, the mountains are high and the slopes are steep, with thick rocks and thin soil. Most of the district's cultivated land consists of small terraces built up with stones along the mountainside. Taiping Mountain is Yu Shundian's hometown; his family has farmed tenant land for four generations, and old Yu rarely had enough to eat, working as a cowherd and doing odd jobs for landlords since childhood.

        Going to the Most Difficult Place

In 1952, Yu Shundian returned to his hometown of Taiping Mountain after being demobilized from the army. The landlords and bullies who rode on the backs of the people were overthrown, and the forests and land returned to the people, but "Heaven" still oppressed them. Many people preferred to stay at the foot of the mountain and were unwilling to live on the mountain. During the land reform, his family was also allocated four mu of land at the foot of the mountain. Yu Shundian began to ponder whether Taiping Mountain had any potential. He visited some elderly people, his elder brother and sister-in-law. Some said, "Down the mountain, there are electric lights and telephones; up the mountain, there are lanterns and torches." Others said, "As long as you are willing to sweat, you can get a bowl of rice even on a cliff." Yes, Yu Shundian thought, there are people, land, trees, and water on the mountain, so why is there no potential, why can't we build socialism? He was determined to return the land at the foot of the mountain and wholeheartedly build the mountainous area, leading the farmers to set up mutual aid teams and establish agricultural production cooperatives. In 1955, he was transferred to the then-Hualin Township as the chief of public security. He applied to the Party organization five times to go to the most difficult place, to build Taiping Mountain. His request was finally approved.

From the foot of the mountain at two or three hundred meters above sea level, all the way to the high mountains at fifteen or sixteen hundred meters above sea level, the terrain is not only complex, and the differences between the top and bottom of the mountain are huge, but the climate is also changeable, with various natural disasters. Moreover, because he had been away from his hometown for many years, he was not very familiar with agricultural production and local natural changes. What to do? The Party branch secretary at the time told him, "Don't be afraid of not knowing, only be afraid of not learning." Learn, Yu Shundian began to learn earnestly from the local farmers, diligently studying agricultural production.

Under these very unfavorable natural conditions, due to Old Yu's down-to-earth work, hard work, and years of observing and studying local crops, soil, and weather, he figured out some rules to guide production. Under the leadership of the commune Party committee and the management district Party general branch, the Taiping Management District has reaped bumper harvests year after year. Last year, the total grain output of the entire management district more than quadrupled compared to 1949 at the time of liberation. This year, the "poor mountainous area" that had been short of grain for years sold more than 600,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

          The Origin of "Old Ling"

One day in 1955, Old Yu was leading the planting of corn in the Taiping Production Team when suddenly a torrential rain hit, washing away more than 40 mu of cornfields, losing the seeds, wasting labor, and missing the season. These losses left a deep impression on Old Yu's mind, and he was determined to find out the patterns of weather changes on Taiping Mountain and become the master of the weather. Over the years, Old Yu has put a lot of effort into studying weather changes. Since 1955, he has kept simple meteorological records every day; he collected a lot of agricultural proverbs and legends about weather changes from the elderly people in the entire management district, and verified, studied, and analyzed them in practice; he got up at the crack of dawn almost every day to go to the mountains to observe the sky and the earth, looking for and studying the rules of natural changes; the phenomenon of several rocks at the entrance of the management district getting tide, and the amount of dew on the roadside weeds, became his "native weather vanes" for testing weather changes. The general law of weather changes on Taiping Mountain was finally mastered by him, enabling them to better "fight guerrilla warfare" with the weather. On June 19 this year, some production teams were rushing to harvest wheat, and Old Yu noticed from the observed "symptoms" that the weather was about to change. He rushed back to the management district from below overnight and used the telephone to notify each production team to prevent rainstorms the next day. The next day, it did rain heavily, but because each team had made preparations in advance, the entire management district basically did not suffer any "threshing ground" losses. People admired him and said, "Our Secretary Yu has become 'Old Ling'!"

                A Meaningful Experiment

Timely early planting of corn has become a widely adopted experience on Taiping Mountain. However, in the spring of 1958, when Old Yu began to introduce this experience to everyone, although many people responded positively, there were also many people who opposed it. Old Yu summarized this experience from on-the-spot observation and research with some old farmers. He found that the seedlings planted later grew faster than those planted earlier, but the yield was generally not as high as those planted earlier. It was said that Old Yu could use this fact to persuade those who opposed it. No, he believed that one year's facts were not enough to convince everyone. Now, people should not only know that timely early planting can increase production, but also know why it can increase production. Only in this way can the idea of timely early planting be established more firmly. At the same time, according to the climatic conditions of Taiping Mountain, how early is the most suitable for early planting? This is also worth studying.

In order to answer these questions, the following year, he planted 190 corn plants in three batches in the Taiping Production Team: the first batch of 60 plants was planted before Qingming, the second batch of 80 plants was planted before Guyu, and the last batch of 50 plants was planted after Guyu. After sowing, he cultivated, managed, and continuously observed and compared the growth of these three batches of corn plants in the same way. The harvest results proved that the yield of the first batch of planting was higher than that of the second batch. The second batch was higher than the third batch, which once again proved that timely early planting can increase production. Through experiments, he also found that early-planted corn, under low ground temperature conditions, first tries to develop the root system after seed vernalization. When the time is right, the seedlings emerge from the soil and the foundation is laid; late-planted corn is different. Under high ground temperature conditions, the seeds germinate quickly after they fall into the soil, and then quickly rush upwards, but the foundation is insufficient. After the harvest, he carefully counted the main roots of the three batches of corn: the first batch had an average of 21 main roots per root, the second batch had 13, and the third batch had only 11. More roots absorb more nutrients and increase wind and drought resistance. This is why early-planted corn can produce more than late-planted corn. Since then, the experience of timely early planting of corn has been widely promoted on Taiping Mountain.

                Fertilizing should suit the field's "appetite"

Anyone who has talked to Yu Shundian about the production of the Taiping Management District has expressed surprise at his familiarity with the situation of the entire management district. He can almost recite what kind of soil a field is and what kind of fertilizer it is suitable for. Let's not talk about how many pairs of shoes he has worn out and how many roads he has traveled to achieve this—it is impossible to achieve this by simply running around without using his brain. Let's tell a story!

Wang Daozhi, a commune member of the sixth team of the Taiping Production Team, has a seven-mu field in front of his house, which was the corn test field for the production team last year. In order to test what kind of fertilizer is suitable for the soil of this field, people divided the seven mu of field into two: the upper three mu used cattle manure as the base fertilizer, and the lower four mu used burnt soil plus manure as the base fertilizer. As a result of the autumn harvest, the upper three mu achieved a yield of 618 jin per mu, while the lower four mu achieved a yield of only 492 jin per mu. At the team's production summary meeting, a dispute occurred. People from several teams on the mountain (including the sixth team) said, "Burnt fertilizer is not good, and we must resolutely revolt against burnt fertilizer." People from several teams at the foot of the mountain objected, saying, "Who said burnt fertilizer is not good? The fields where we use burnt fertilizer yield more than the fields where we use cattle manure." The two sides argued endlessly, and their eyes were directed at Old Yu, hoping that he would make a fair conclusion. Can this conclusion be made immediately? No, Old Yu refused to speak rashly without a basis. After the meeting, he carried a hoe and ran all over the mountains and mountains, visiting the masses in each team. The conclusion was finally found: the teams at the foot of the mountain are mostly yellow sandstone soil fields, which are naturally loose and not afraid of knotting, and are suitable for burning burnt fertilizer; the teams on the mountain are mostly white clay soil fields, which contain heavy moisture. Through the rotting of cattle manure, they absorb part of the moisture and can also loosen the soil. He said to the people who had been arguing, "Fertilizing the field is like people eating. If it suits your appetite, you eat more. If it doesn't suit your appetite, you eat less. We must also suit the field's 'appetite' when fertilizing!"

                  "Three Sowing Lines"

Recently, Yu Shundian has been studying the issue of "three sowing lines" with the production team and team cadres.

The so-called "three sowing lines" means that according to the characteristics of the great seasonal differences between the high mountains and low mountains of Taiping Mountain, the autumn sowing this year and the spring planting next year should be arranged together in a way that suits local conditions. Zhao Chuanmao, a commune member of the Taiping Production Team, is said to be good at farming by everyone. He knows what to plant and what not to plant on that piece of land, and what to plant in the last season and what to plant in the next season. Old Yu went to him to ask for advice on the arrangement of crop rotations. Zhao Chuanmao said, "Growing crops depends on people. Sometimes people reduce production in good years, and people reap a good harvest in bad years. 'For every ten feet the mountain rises, the water cools by three points.' Different situations require different crops. What to plant on the top and bottom of the mountain, on the shady and sunny slopes, must be in accordance with the temper of the land." According to this lesson, Old Yu discussed with many cadres and commune members, concentrated the experience of various places, and summed up these "three sowing lines": the first line is the high mountains above 1,300 to 1,400 meters above sea level, where wheat is generally not grown, but corn is intercropped in potato fields, and potatoes and corn are grown in rotation; the second line is the semi-high mountains around 1,000 meters above sea level, where the climate and soil are suitable for growing barley and broad beans, and late corn is planted after the barley and broad beans are harvested; the third line is the low mountainous area below 800 meters above sea level, where a large amount of wheat is planted, and sweet potatoes and sesame seeds are planted after the wheat is harvested, or millet is intercropped in the wheat fields. This kind of sowing can not only expand the autumn sowing area and ensure a bumper summer harvest next year, but also ensure that the spring sowing next year will not miss the season, and ensure a bumper autumn harvest next year. The commune members praised Old Yu for coming up with another good idea for everyone.

    高度革命热情和实事求是精神相结合
    余顺典掌握天时地利发展山区生产
    湖北远安县城关公社太平管理区党总支书记余顺典同志，是一个善于领导生产的好干部。
    太平管理区位于城东南的太平山上。这里山高坡陡，石厚土薄，全区的耕地大多数都是傍山打垱用石头码起来的一小块一小块的梯田。太平山是余顺典的家乡，一家四代人种佃田，老余从小就给地主放牛、打零工，难得吃一次饱饭。
        到最困难的地方去
    1952年，余顺典从部队转业回到自己家乡的太平山上。骑在人民头上的地主、恶霸被打倒了，山林土地回了老家，但是“天老爷”还欺压着人们，许多人还是愿意在山下，不愿意在山上。土地改革时也给他家分了四亩山下的地。余顺典开始琢磨，到底太平山上有没有出息。他拜访了一些大爷大妈们，哥哥嫂嫂们，有的说：“山下电灯电话，山上灯笼火把。”有的却说：“只要舍得一身汗，崖板上就是一碗饭。”对，余顺典想，山上有人有土、有树有水，为什么没有出息，为什么不能建设社会主义？他下决心把山下那几亩地退了，一心一意建设山区，领导农民办起了互助组，建立了农业生产合作社。1955年，他被调到当时的花林乡当治安保卫主任。他五次向党组织申请，到最困难的地方去，去建设太平山。他的要求终于被批准了。
    从拔海两三百米的山下，一直拉到拔海一千五、六百米的高山，不仅地势复杂，山上山下差异很大，而且气候多变，有各种自然灾害。他又由于多年离开家乡，对农业生产和当地的自然变化情况，也不很熟悉了。怎么办呢？当时党支部书记告诉他：“不怕不会，只怕不学。”学，余顺典开始认真地向当地农民学习，刻苦地钻研农业生产。
    就在这种非常不利的自然条件下，由于老余踏实工作，埋头苦干，数年如一日地留心观察和研究当地作物、土壤、天气，从中摸出了一些规律来指导生产。太平管理区在公社党委和管理区党总支领导下，连年获得丰收。去年全管理区粮食总产量比解放时的1949年翻了两番多。历年缺粮的“穷山区”，今年就向国家卖了六十几万斤余粮。
          “灵老”的由来
    1955年有一天，老余正在太平生产队领导播种苞谷，突然一阵暴雨，四十多亩苞谷田被打坂结了，棵苗没生，损失了种子，浪费了劳力，还误了季节。这些损失在老余的思想上留下了深刻的印象，他下决心要找出太平山上天气变化的规律，当天气的主人。几年来，老余在研究天气的变化上下了很大功夫。从1955年起，他每天都有简单的气象记载；他从全管理区的老人口中，搜集了很多有关天气变化的农谚和传说，并在实际中把它们加以验证，进行研究和分析；他几乎每天都是一麻亮起床，到山上去观天观地，寻找和研究自然变化的规律；管理区门口几块石头起潮的现象，路旁野草上露水的多少，都成了他测验天气变化的“土晴雨表”。太平山上天气变化的一般规律终于被他掌握了，使他们能更好地和天气“打游击”。今年6月19日，一些生产队正在抢打小麦，老余从观察的“症候”上发觉，快要变天了。他连夜从下面赶回管理区，用电话通知各生产队第二天打麦要预防暴雨。第二天，果然下了大雨，由于各队事先都作好了准备，全管理区基本上没遭到“场场”的损失。人们钦佩地说：“我们的余书记变成‘灵老’了。”
                一次有意义的试验
    适时早播苞谷，这在太平山上已成为普遍采用的经验了。可是1958年春天，当老余开始向大家介绍这个经验时，虽然有很多人积极响应，可是也有不少人反对。老余是从实地观察和与一些老农的研究中，总结出这条经验的。他发现，迟播的苗子比早播的就是长得快，可是，产量一般却不如早播的高。照说老余可以用这个事实来说服那些反对的人了。不，他认为一年的事实还不足说服大家，现在不仅应当使人们知道适时早播能增产，而且还要使大家知道为什么能增产，只有这样，适时早播的思想才能树立得更加牢靠。同时，根据太平山的气候条件，早播要早到什么时候最适宜呢？这也值得研究。
    为了回答这些问题，第二年，他在太平生产队分三批播种了一百九十棵苞谷：第一批清明前播了六十棵，第二批谷雨前又播了八十棵，最后一批五十棵是在谷雨后下的种。下种后，他对这三批苞谷一样的培育，一样的管理，不断地观察和比较它们的生长情况。收获的结果证明，第一批播种的比第二批播种的产量高。第二批又比第三批产量高，这又一次证明了适时早播能增产。通过试验，他还发现早播的苞谷在地面低温的条件下，种子春化后首先尽量发展根系，到了一定时机，苗子出土了，根基也打足了；迟播的却不同，在地面温度较高的条件下，种子一落土很快就发芽，发芽后又很快地往上冲，可是根基不足。收获后他仔细数了三批苞谷的主根：第一批每根平均有主根二十一条，第二批十三条，第三批只有十一条。根多吸收养分多，而且增加了防风耐旱能力，这就是早播的苞谷为什么比迟播的能增产的道理。从此，苞谷适时早播种的经验在太平山普遍推广了。
                下肥要合田的“胃口”
    凡是和余顺典谈过太平管理区生产的人，没有一个人不对他熟悉全管理区情况的程度表示惊异。那块田是什么土质，它适合下什么肥料，他差不多都背得出来。这里且不讲他曾经磨破过多少双鞋，跑了多少路，才能作到这步，——光跑路，不动脑的人，也是不可能作到这步的。还是让我们讲一个故事吧！
    太平生产队第六小队社员王道志的门口，有七亩大的一块田，是生产队干部去年的苞谷试验田。为了试验什么肥料适合这块田的土质，人们把这七亩田一分两开：上面三亩底肥下的是牛栏粪，下面四亩底肥是火土加大粪。秋收的结果，上面三亩单产达到六百一十八斤，下面四亩单产只有四百九十二斤。在全队总结生产的会议上，争执发生了。山上几个小队（包括第六小队）的人说：“火粪就是不好，要坚决革火粪的命。”山下几个队的人反对说：“谁说火粪不好，我们那里下火粪的田比下牛栏粪的田产量高。”双方争执不下，把眼睛直往老余身上溜，希望他出来作个公正的结论。这个结论能马上作吗？不，没有根据的话，老余是不肯乱说的。散会后，他扛上一把挖锄，跑遍了山上山下，到各个小队去访问群众。结论终于被找出来了，原来山下几个队大都是黄石楂子土田，本性松活，不怕坂结，适宜烧火粪；山上几个队大都是白善土田，含水分重，通过牛栏粪的腐烂，吸收一部分水分，也能泡松土壤。他对原来争执的人们说：“田下粪好比人吃东西，合胃口的吃得多，不合胃口的就吃得少，我们施肥也要合田的‘胃口’啊！”
                  “三道播种线”
    最近，余顺典正在和生产队、小队的干部研究“三道播种线”的问题。
    所谓“三道播种线”，就是根据太平山的高山低山季节差异很大的特点，因地制宜地把今年的秋种和明年春播的茬口一齐安排。太平生产队社员赵传茂，大家都说他会种田，那块地种什么不种什么，上季种什么下季种什么，都摸得一清二楚。老余去向他请教茬口安排问题，赵传茂说：“种庄稼在于人，有时年成好也有人减产，年成坏也有人丰收。‘山高一丈，水冷三分’，情况不同种的庄稼就不同。山上山下，阴坡阳坡，种些什么，都得顺着土地的脾气。”老余根据这个教训，又和许多干部、社员商量，集中各地的经验，总结出这个“三道播种线”来：第一道线是拔海一千三、四百米以上的高山，一般不种小麦，而实行洋芋田里套种苞谷，洋芋苞谷连作；第二道线是拔海一千米左右的半高山，气候、土壤都适宜种大麦、蚕豆，大麦、蚕豆收割后再赶一季迟苞谷；第三道线是拔海八百米以下的低山区，则大量种小麦，小麦收割后再插红苕、种芝麻，或在小麦田里套种粟谷。这样播种，既能扩大秋种面积，保证明年夏季大丰收，又能使明年春播不误季节，保证明年秋季大丰收。社员们赞扬老余又为大家出了个好主意。
