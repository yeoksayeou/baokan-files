Editor's Note: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Kennedy has been elected as the next U.S. President in the election held on the 8th. Like the current U.S. President Eisenhower, Kennedy is also an agent of U.S. monopoly capital. His election does not mean any fundamental changes in the domestic and foreign policies of the next U.S. government. Many of Kennedy's own statements prove this point. We can know his present by looking at Kennedy's past, and we can know his future by looking at his present. The following are some of Kennedy's statements on U.S. foreign policy during the campaign. These statements show that Kennedy is no less than his predecessor Eisenhower in pursuing anti-Soviet and anti-communist policies and seeking aggressive expansionist goals.

    从肯尼迪的言论看肯尼迪政策
    编者按：美国民主党总统候选人肯尼迪已在8日举行的大选中当选为下届美国总统。和现任美国总统艾森豪威尔一样，肯尼迪也是美国垄断财团的代理人。他的当选决不意味着美国下届政府的内政外交会有任何根本的改变。肯尼迪本人的许多言论，就证明了这一点。我们看肯尼迪的过去就可以知道他的现在，看他的现在就可以知道他的将来。以下是肯尼迪在竞选活动中发表的关于美国外交政策的一些言论。这些言论表明，肯尼迪在奉行反苏反共政策、追求侵略扩张目的上，是丝毫也不亚于他的前任艾森豪威尔的。
