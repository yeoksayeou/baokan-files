   Congolese Military and Civilians' Patriotic Struggle Intensifies
   Soldiers in Leopoldville Camp Dissatisfied with Mobutu's Rule, Angrily Arrest Reactionary Officers; Stanleyville People Demonstrate in Support of Lumumba Government and Oppose Treacherous Clique's Conspiracy

Xinhua News Agency, 26th - Leopoldville Dispatch: More than two thousand Congolese soldiers in Leopoldville Camp, the largest military camp in the Congolese capital, are increasingly dissatisfied with the rule of reactionary officers such as Mobutu, who have been bought off by imperialism. According to the Indian Press Trust, citing well-informed sources in Leopoldville, angry soldiers rose up and arrested some reactionary officers, demanding answers to their questions. These sources also said that the soldiers complained that their military pay was too low.

The report said that the soldiers had removed certain reactionary officers from their posts and elected their own officers.

Due to the soldiers' strong dissatisfaction, the traitor Mobutu dared not go to the camp. The Indian Press Trust reported that "Colonel Mobutu sent several officers to ease the soldiers' (dissatisfaction), but he himself could not visit the camp."

It is also reported that the situation in Leopoldville remains tense. The "UN Headquarters," telecommunications buildings, and other strategic locations there have seen a continuous increase in "UN forces," while "UN force" "patrols" in jeeps and trucks constantly "patrol" the streets and roads, attempting to intimidate the Congolese patriotic military and civilians.

Xinhua News Agency, 27th - Stanleyville Dispatch: In Stanleyville, the capital of the Eastern Province of Congo, local people have recently held continuous demonstrations in support of the Lumumba government.

According to reports, the traitor Mobutu sent several of his followers to the Congolese garrison in Stanleyville a few days ago to carry out conspiracies, attempting to incite soldiers against the Lumumba government, but were opposed by the soldiers. It is reported that around that time, the masses in Stanleyville launched four consecutive demonstrations, expressing their loyalty to Prime Minister Lumumba and opposing the traitors such as Tshombe and Mobutu.

    刚果军民爱国斗争日益扩大
   利奥波德军营的士兵不满蒙博托统治愤怒逮捕反动军官斯  坦利维尔人民示威支持卢蒙巴政府反对卖国集团阴谋
    新华社26日讯　利奥波德维尔消息：刚果首都最大军营——利奥波德军营的二千多名刚果士兵，对被帝国主义收买的蒙博托等反动军官的统治愈来愈不满。据印度报业托辣斯援引利奥波德维尔消息灵通人士的话说，愤怒的士兵起来逮捕了一些反动军官，要求回答他们的问题。这些人士还说，士兵们还抱怨他们的军饷太少。
    消息说，士兵们已经免除了某些反动军官的职务，并选出了他们自己的军官。
    在士兵们的强烈不满下，叛国分子蒙博托不敢前往军营。印度报业托辣斯报道说，“蒙博托上校派去了几个军官去缓和士兵们的（不满）情绪，但是他自己无法去访问这个军营。”
    另据报道，利奥波德维尔的局势仍然紧张。那里的“联合国总部”、电讯大楼等战略据点的“联合国军”在不断增加，而“联合国军”的“巡逻队”乘着吉普车和卡车在街道上和公路上不断“巡逻”，企图对刚果爱国军民进行恫吓。
    新华社27日讯　斯坦利维尔消息：在刚果东方省省会斯坦利维尔，当地人民最近连续举行示威游行，支持卢蒙巴政府。
    据报道，几天以前，叛国分子蒙博托曾派他的几个追随者到斯坦利维尔的刚果驻军中去进行阴谋活动，企图挑起士兵反对卢蒙巴政府，但是遭到士兵的反对。消息说，在这前后，斯坦利维尔群众连续展开了四次示威游行，表示忠于卢蒙巴总理，反对冲伯、蒙博托等卖国贼。
