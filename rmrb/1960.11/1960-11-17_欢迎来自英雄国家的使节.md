Welcome Envoys from a Heroic Nation

The Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation, headed by Ernesto "Che" Guevara, President of the National Bank of Cuba, will arrive in Beijing today. During its visit to China, the delegation will hold talks with the Chinese government delegation on issues such as the development of trade and economic relations between the two countries. This is the first government delegation from Cuba to visit China, marking a new stage in the friendly cooperative relationship between the Chinese and Cuban people. The Chinese people extend the warmest welcome to the distinguished guests from Cuba, who resolutely oppose US imperialist aggression and safeguard their national independence.

Cuba is a heroic country, and the Cuban people are a heroic people. The victory of the Cuban People's Revolution opened a new stage in the national democratic revolutionary movement in Latin American countries. For twenty-two and a half months, the Cuban people have been closely united around the revolutionary government headed by Fidel Castro, holding high the banner of the national democratic revolution, and with a spirit of fearless revolution and unwavering revolutionary perseverance, they have crushed the heinous interference and sabotage activities of US imperialism, defending and advancing the revolutionary cause of Cuba. The first stage of the Cuban Revolution has yielded fruitful results: the patriotic democratic forces are rapidly growing, the unity of the people has been significantly strengthened, the compromising and capitulationist elements hidden within the revolutionary ranks are constantly being purged, and the counter-revolutionaries continue to be resolutely suppressed; the national land reform has been basically completed, and the planting area and yield of crops are expanding and increasing; US monopoly capital enterprises in Cuba have all been nationalized; Cuba's revolutionary armed forces have been continuously consolidated and expanded, and a system of universal conscription has been implemented, ready at any time to repel enemies who dare to invade Cuban territory; in terms of diplomacy, Cuba has pursued a policy of peace and friendship with all countries, and has successively established diplomatic relations with socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, developing and expanding trade relations with these countries. Now, the Cuban Revolution has begun to enter its second stage, due to the Cuban Revolutionary Government's promulgation on October 14th of laws nationalizing large enterprises and private banks, and the promulgation on October 15th of the Urban Reform Law. The program for this new stage is the "Havana Declaration," adopted by the Cuban People's National Assembly held in Havana, the capital of Cuba, on September 2nd. The Cuban Revolutionary Government pointed out that the tasks of the new stage are: to continue to advance land reform and implement the nationalization policy, to realize national industrialization and agricultural diversification, to increase production and eliminate unemployment, to eliminate illiteracy and develop people's education, and to resolutely defeat the aggression and subversion plots of US imperialism and counter-revolutionary forces. These tasks are undoubtedly arduous, but since the Cuban Revolutionary Government was able to rely on the people and overcome all difficulties to achieve brilliant victories in the past, it can certainly continue to draw tremendous strength from the people in the future revolutionary cause and eliminate all difficulties on the road forward.

The significance and impact of the victory, consolidation, and development of the Cuban Revolution have far exceeded the scope of one country. Throughout Latin America, revolutionary Cuba has become a clear banner. The Cuban people's tit-for-tat struggle against US imperialism, their firm opposition to aggression, their defense of national independence, and their pursuit of economic development and social progress—all of this shows the Latin American people and the people of the world that US imperialism is not only not terrifying but can be defeated. The Cuban people have set an example with their own struggle: that countries closest to the United States and most tightly controlled by the United States can achieve victory in the national liberation struggle; that it is possible to develop a national economy without the so-called "assistance" from the United States. In this way, the paper tiger of the United States has been exposed once again. The heroic struggle of the Cuban people has not only greatly encouraged the national democratic revolutionary struggles of the people of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, but has also made outstanding and significant contributions to opposing the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism and defending world peace.

Naturally, US imperialism, which is the enemy of the people of the world, is by no means reconciled to its failure in Cuba. As the Cuban Revolution deepens, US imperialism has intensified its interference and aggression: on the one hand, it has implemented a comprehensive embargo against Cuba, vainly attempting to create difficulties for Cuba through economic blockade in order to undermine and strangle the Cuban Revolution; on the other hand, it is actively preparing for armed invasion, attempting to overthrow the Cuban Revolutionary Government. Cuban counter-revolutionaries and mercenaries gathered in the US state of Florida and in the territories of Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti are ready to move. The United States has also strengthened its military projects and combat deployments at the Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba, replaced the base commander, constantly conducted threatening military "exercises," and once sent Marines to land at the base to "show strength." These signs all indicate that the danger of US armed aggression against Cuba is increasing day by day.

However, as Prime Minister Fidel Castro said, "The Cuban people are an invincible force." The Cuban Revolution relied on the unity and struggle of the people to defeat the Batista dictatorship, which was armed to the teeth by US imperialism; it also relied on the unity and struggle of the people to crush countless sabotage and subversion plots by US imperialism and its running dogs, and to enable Cuba to advance by leaps and bounds on the road to economic independence and social progress. Since the Cuban people were able to achieve revolutionary victory, they will also be able to defend the victory of the revolution. Today's international situation is very favorable for the Cuban people who are carrying out a just struggle. Cuba has friends all over the world. The people of Latin American countries, the people of socialist countries, and all peace-loving people in the world stand on the side of the Cuban people. Relying on their own strength, relying on the unity and struggle of the people, and with the joint support of progressive and peace-loving forces internationally, the Cuban people will surely continue to make persistent efforts, overcome any aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism, and advance the revolution.

The Chinese people stand on the eastern front of the struggle against US imperialism, and the Cuban people stand on the western front of the struggle against US imperialism, encouraging and supporting each other in the struggle against the common enemy. The people of China and Cuba have long established a profound friendship. The Chinese people have always followed the Cuban people's tenacious struggle against US imperialism with admiration, and are willing to do their best to give the heroic Cuban people resolute support. We firmly believe that the just struggle of the Cuban people will surely move from victory to victory. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba has laid a solid foundation for the development of friendship between the people of our two countries. This friendly visit to our country by the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation headed by Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara will surely further strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries.

    欢迎来自英雄国家的使节
    以古巴国家银行行长埃尔内斯托·切·格瓦拉为首的古巴革命政府经济代表团将于今天到达北京。代表团在中国访问期间，将同我国政府代表团就发展两国贸易和经济关系等问题进行会谈。这是古巴第一个前来我国访问的政府代表团，它标志着中古两国人民的友好合作关系已经进入了一个新阶段。中国人民对来自坚决反对美帝国主义侵略、维护民族独立的古巴的贵宾们，表示最热烈的欢迎。
    古巴是一个英雄的国家，古巴人民是英雄的人民。古巴人民革命的胜利开辟了拉丁美洲各国民族民主革命运动的新阶段。二十二个半月以来，古巴人民紧密地团结在以菲德尔·卡斯特罗为首的革命政府周围，高举民族民主革命大旗，以大无畏的革命精神和坚韧不拔的革命毅力，粉碎美帝国主义穷凶极恶的干涉和破坏活动，保卫并推进了古巴的革命事业。古巴革命的第一阶段，已经获得了丰硕的果实：爱国民主力量正在迅速地壮大，人民团结有了显著加强，隐藏在革命阵营内部的妥协投降分子不断地被清洗出去，反革命分子继续受到坚决的镇压；全国的土地改革已经基本完成，农作物的播种面积和产量都在扩大和增长，美国垄断资本在古巴的企业已经全部收归国有；古巴的革命武装不断巩固和扩大，并且实行全民皆兵，时刻准备着迎击胆敢侵犯古巴领土的敌人；在外交方面，古巴执行了同各国人民和平友好的政策，并先后同苏联、中国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国等社会主义国家建立了外交关系，发展和扩大了同这些国家的贸易关系。现在，古巴革命已经由于古巴革命政府10月14日颁布把大企业和私营银行收归国有的法律和10月15日颁布城市改革法而开始进入了第二阶段。这个新阶段的纲领是9月2日在古巴首都哈瓦那举行的古巴人民全国大会通过的“哈瓦那宣言”。古巴革命政府指出，新阶段的任务是：继续推进土地改革和执行国有化政策，实现国家工业化和农业的多种经营，增加生产和消灭失业现象，扫除文盲和发展人民教育事业，并坚决击溃美帝国主义和反革命势力的侵略、颠复阴谋。这些任务无疑是艰巨的，但是，古巴革命政府过去既然能够依靠人民、排除万难，取得了辉煌的胜利，那么在今后的革命事业中，它当然可以继续从人民中吸取巨大的力量，扫除在前进道路上的一切困难。
    古巴革命的胜利、巩固和发展的意义和影响，已经远远地超出了一国的范围。在整个拉丁美洲，革命的古巴已成为一面鲜明的旗帜。古巴人民同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，坚决反对侵略、维护民族独立、争取经济发展和社会进步——所有这一切，向拉丁美洲人民以及全世界人民表明：美帝国主义不仅并不可怕；而且是可以被战胜的。古巴人民以自己的斗争树立了榜样：离美国最近、受美国控制最严的国家，是可以取得民族解放斗争的胜利的；没有美国的所谓“援助”，是可以发展民族经济的。这样，美国这只纸老虎就又一次被戳穿了。古巴人民的英勇斗争，不仅大大地鼓舞了拉丁美洲、亚洲和非洲各国人民的民族民主革命斗争，而且对反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平，作出了杰出和重大的贡献。
    自然，以世界人民为敌的美帝国主义绝不甘心它在古巴的失败。随着古巴革命的深入发展，美帝国主义加紧了它的干涉、侵略步骤：一方面对古巴实行全面禁运，妄想用经济封锁的手段给古巴制造困难，以破坏和扼杀古巴革命；另一方面又积极准备武装入侵，妄图推翻古巴革命政府。聚集在美国的佛罗里达州和危地马拉、洪都拉斯、尼加拉瓜、多米尼加、海地等国领土上的古巴反革命分子和雇佣兵正在蠢蠢欲动。美国还加强了它在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地的军事工程和战斗部署，更换了基地司令，不断进行威胁性的军事“演习”，并且一度派遣海军陆战队在这个基地登陆以“显示力量”。这些迹象都表明，美国武装侵略古巴的危险正与日俱增。
    但是，正如菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理所说的，“古巴人民是不可战胜的力量。”古巴革命正是依靠了人民的团结和斗争战胜了由美帝国主义武装到牙齿的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权；也正是依靠人民的团结和斗争粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗无数次破坏、颠复阴谋，并使古巴在经济独立和社会进步的道路上大步前进。古巴人民既然能够取得革命的胜利，也就能够保卫革命的胜利。今天的国际形势，对于进行正义斗争的古巴人民是十分有利的。古巴人民的朋友遍于全世界。拉丁美洲各国人民，社会主义阵营各国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民都站在古巴人民一边。古巴人民依靠自己力量，依靠人民的团结和斗争，以及国际上进步和爱好和平力量的联合支持，一定能够再接再厉，战胜美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋，把革命推向前进。
    中国人民站在反对美帝国主义斗争的东方前线，古巴人民站在反对美帝国主义斗争的西方前线，在反对共同敌人的斗争中，互相鼓舞，互相支持。中古两国人民早已建立了深厚的战斗友谊。中国人民一直以钦佩的心情，关注着古巴人民反对美帝国主义的顽强斗争，并且愿意尽力之所及，给予英雄的古巴人民以坚决的支持。我们深信，古巴人民的正义斗争必将从胜利走向胜利。中古两国外交关系的建立，为我们两国人民之间友谊的发展，奠定了牢固的基础。这一次以埃尔内斯托·切·格瓦拉少校为首的古巴革命政府经济代表团前来我国进行友好访问，必将进一步加强我们两国之间的友好合作关系。
