A good way to protect livestock through the winter
Fattening cattle with calcified straw

Protecting draft animals and keeping them in good condition over the winter is a comprehensive feeding and management problem that must be addressed through both warm housing and appropriate feed. The main feed for draft animals in winter is crop straw. Straw feed is relatively coarse and some of it is difficult to digest and absorb. Even though livestock eat a lot every day, they still inevitably lose weight. Last year, in the Dajinwan Brigade of the Yanghe Commune in Yingcheng County, Hubei Province, we treated rice straw with lime water, added human urine and salt water to feed draft cattle (yellow cattle). During the seventy-day trial period, the draft cattle in the experimental group gained an average total weight of twenty catties per head, while another group fed only ordinary dry rice straw lost an average of seven and a half catties per head. To confirm this result, an experiment was also conducted in the Hou'ai Brigade of the same commune, and the effect was also very good. Why can feeding draft cattle with rice straw treated with lime water, plus human urine and salt water, increase their weight? There are several reasons:

First, calcification of the rice straw can break down its fiber structure and dissolve some of the difficult-to-digest silicate, thereby improving the digestibility of the rice straw for draft cattle. According to our digestion tests on buffalo, the average protein digestibility of the experimental group of cattle was 57% per head, while that of cattle eating ordinary rice straw was only 42%.

Second, we know that the microorganisms in the rumen of ruminant animals play a major role in the digestion of fiber. The activity of rumen microorganisms largely depends on the acidity and alkalinity of the rumen. An alkaline environment is conducive to the activity and reproduction of microorganisms, and feeding calcified rice straw is conducive to creating an alkaline environment in the rumen. At the same time, the increase in microbial activity is also closely related to the amount of nitrogenous substances and carbohydrates ingested by the livestock. Human urine is rich in non-protein nitrogenous substances, for example, the content of urea in it accounts for about half of the total solids in urine. According to data, feeding ruminants with urea, one kilogram of urea is equivalent to about 8.6 feed units. This is because the microorganisms in the rumen of ruminants have a strong ability to synthesize non-protein nitrogenous substances into the proteins they need; at the same time, after the microorganisms enter the abomasum, they all die and become good nutrients for livestock.

The increase in the acidity and alkalinity of the stomach towards the alkaline side, and the amount of pure protein in the gastric juice also increased correspondingly. For example, if the protein content of the gastric juice at the beginning of the yellow cattle experiment is 100%, then it was 292% at the end of the experiment, an increase of nearly two times. The increase was even more significant for buffalo, with the content at the end of the experiment being 775% of that at the beginning of the experiment. This shows that the increase in the content of pure protein in the stomach comes from the nitrogen content in the feed supplied.

Third, rice straw treated with lime can also increase the calcium content of the rice straw, while the calcium content of ordinary crop straw is very low.

The following is a brief introduction to the preparation and feeding method of calcified rice straw: Use a wooden bucket, and add quicklime in the proportion of one catty to one and a half catties of quicklime per hundred catties of water. First pour the quicklime, add a small amount of water to make a lime slurry, and then add enough water according to the proportion. Cut the rice straw (other straw can also be used) into about three inches long, pour it into lime water, to the extent that it is submerged. Stir for fifteen minutes, and then use stones to press the rice straw to the bottom of the bucket for one to two hours. Then take out the rice straw, drain it, and spread it on a clean ground to dry for eighteen to twenty-four hours to obtain a crisp, golden-yellow calcified rice straw. Lime water can be reused, but half a catty of quicklime must be added to every hundred catties of old liquid to replenish its concentration, until the old liquid changes color. Generally, it can be used continuously for three or four times.

Before feeding, mix the chopped ordinary rice straw with calcified rice straw, sprinkle with human urine and salt water, stir well, and then feed the draft cattle. At the beginning, cattle generally do not like to eat it because they are not used to it, and it takes a period of patient training. In the first few days, ordinary rice straw can account for four-fifths of the total amount, and then gradually increase, and they will get used to it after a period of time. According to our experiments, the amount of calcified rice straw, human urine, and salt water is generally 8 to 12 catties of calcified rice straw, 2 to 3 catties of human urine, and 1 to 2 taels of salt per day for adult cattle; about 5 to 8 catties of calcified rice straw, 1 to 2 catties of human urine, and half a tael to one tael of salt per day for two-year-old draft cattle. Calcified rice straw must be mixed with ordinary rice straw, and too much human urine should not be fed to avoid poisoning; and it is best to use fresh urine, and the effect of old urine is poor.

    保护牲畜过冬的一个好办法
    用钙化稻草喂牛可以增膘
    耕畜越冬保膘是一个综合性的饲养管理问题，必须从畜舍保暖和饲料等方面来解决。耕畜在冬季的主要饲料是农作物的秸秆。藁秆饲料比较粗硬，有的难于消化吸收，尽管家畜每天采食很多，有时仍不免发生掉膘。我们去年曾在湖北应城县杨河公社大金湾大队，将稻草用石灰水处理后，加上人尿和食盐水饲喂耕牛（黄牛）。在七十天试验期内，试验组的耕牛，平均每头总增重二十斤，而另一组只喂普通干稻草的耕牛，平均每头反降重七点五斤。为证实这一结果，又在同一公社的后艾大队进行了试验，效果也很好。为什么稻草经过石灰水处理，加上人尿和食盐水饲喂耕牛，就能增膘呢？有以下几点原因：
    第一，稻草经过钙化，可破坏其纤维组织，并能溶去其中部分难于消化的矽酸，从而提高了耕牛对稻草的消化率。根据我们对水牛所进行的消化试验表明，试验组的耕牛对蛋白质消化率，每头平均为57％，吃普通稻草的牛，蛋白质消化率只达42％。
    第二，我们知道，家畜反刍瘤胃中的微生物对纤维的消化能力起着很大作用。而瘤胃中微生物的活性，很大程度上决定于瘤胃中的酸碱度。碱性环境有利于微生物的活动和繁殖，喂钙化稻草，就有利于创造瘤胃中的碱性环境；同时，微生物活性的增加，也与家畜所食入的含氮物质和碳水化合物的多少有着密切的关系。人尿含有丰富的非蛋白质含氮物质，例如其中尿素的含量，约占尿中总固体的一半左右。根据资料，用尿素饲喂反刍动物，一公斤尿素约相当于八点六饲料单位。因为反刍动物瘤胃中的微生物，有着强烈的综合非蛋白质含氮物转化为本身所需要的蛋白质的能力；同时微生物进入第四胃后，即全部死亡而成为家畜良好的营养物质。
    胃内酸碱度向碱性方面增大，胃液中含纯蛋白质量也相应地大大增加，如以黄牛试验始期的胃液蛋白质含量为100％，试验末期则为292％，增加了近二倍。水牛则更为显著，试验末期的含量为试验期的775％。这说明了胃内纯蛋白质含量的增加，来源于所供应的饲料中的氮的含量。
    第三，稻草经过石灰处理后，还可增加稻草中钙质的含量，而一般作物藁秆钙质含量是很低的。
    下面简单介绍一下钙化稻草的调制和饲喂方法：用一木桶，按一百斤清水加一斤到一斤半生石灰的比例，先将石灰倒入，加入少量清水调成石灰浆后，再按比例将水加足。把稻草（其他藁秆也可）切成三寸长左右，倒入石灰水内，以浸没为度。搅拌十五分钟后，用石块将稻草压沉桶底一至二小时。然后将稻草取出，滤干，摊于干净的地面上晾晒十八至二十四小时，就得到较脆的金黄色钙化稻草。石灰水可以再用，但得按陈液一百斤补加生石灰半斤以补足其浓度，一直到陈液变色为止，一般可连续用三、四次。
    饲喂前，将已切短的普通稻草和钙化稻草混合，洒上人尿和食盐水，搅拌均匀后饲喂耕牛。开始时，一般牛由于不习惯，不大喜吃，要经过一段耐心的训练。头几天普通稻草可占总量的五分之四，以后逐渐增加，经过一段时间就会习惯。根据我们的试验，钙化稻草、人尿和盐水的用量，一般成年牛每天可喂钙化稻草八至十二斤，人尿二至三斤，食盐一至二两；二岁左右的耕牛，每天可喂钙化稻草五至八斤，人尿一至二斤，食盐半两至一两。钙化稻草一定要与普通稻草混合饲喂，人尿不能喂得过多，以免中毒；而且最好是新鲜的，陈尿的效果较差。
