Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th. One of the important power projects stipulated in the Soviet Seven-Year Plan—the Kremenchug Hydropower Station—was fully completed and put into operation on November 1st. Less than eleven months elapsed from the start of power generation by its first hydraulic unit to the commissioning of the last, the twelfth, unit.

The Kremenchug Hydropower Station is one of a series of hydropower stations on the Dnieper River, the second largest river in the European part of the Soviet Union. It has a total generating capacity of 625,000 kilowatts and can generate 2.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The construction of this hydropower station has created a large reservoir near the station with a water storage capacity of approximately 20 billion cubic meters. This is the largest artificial reservoir on the Dnieper River, and its storage capacity can ensure the continuous power generation of the Kremenchug Hydropower Station throughout the year and increase the power generation capacity of the downstream hydropower stations on the Dnieper River—the Dnieper Hydropower Station, the Dneprodzerzhinsk Hydropower Station, and the Kakhovka Hydropower Station—by approximately 20%.

The Kremenchug Hydropower Station officially began construction in November 1957. Due to the continuous acceleration of construction speed and the continuous adoption of advanced technology by the builders, its first hydraulic unit started generating electricity in early December of last year, two years ahead of schedule, and the entire hydropower station was completed and put into operation far ahead of schedule.

    苏联七年计划又一重要动力工程提前建成
    克列门楚格水电站全部投入生产
    发电能力达六十二万五千瓩　每年可发电二十五亿度
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联七年计划规定的重要动力工程之一——克列门楚格水电站，已经在11月1日全部建成和投入生产。从它的第一台水力联动机开始发电到最后一台、即第十二台联动机投入生产，相隔还不到十一个月。
    克列门楚格水电站是苏联欧洲部分第二大河——第聂伯河上一系列水电站当中的一个。它的总发电能力为六十二万五千瓩，每年可以发电二十五亿度。由于这个水电站的建设，在电站附近形成了一个可蓄水约二百亿立方米的大水库。这是第聂伯河上最大的人造水库，它的蓄水量可以保证克列门楚格水电站全年不间断地发电，并使第聂伯河下游各水电站——第聂伯水电站、第聂伯罗捷尔任斯基水电站和卡霍夫卡水电站的发电能力大约提高20％。
    克列门楚格水电站是1957年11月正式动工兴建的。建设者们由于不断加快建设速度和不断采用先进的技术，结果就使它的第一台水力联动机提前两年，在去年12月初开始发电，并使整个水电站大大提前建成和投入生产。（附图片）
