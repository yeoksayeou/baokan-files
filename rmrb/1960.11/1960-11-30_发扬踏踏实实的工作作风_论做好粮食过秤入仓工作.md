Promote a Down-to-Earth Work Style
——On Doing a Good Job of Weighing and Storing Grain

Currently, rural areas across the country are tensely carrying out an important task, which is the weighing and storing of grain. Grain purchased by the state is weighed and enters state warehouses, and seeds, rations, and fodder left for rural use are weighed and enter collectively owned warehouses.

The broad masses of commune members and cadres in rural people's communes have expressed widespread attention and enthusiastic support for the work of weighing and storing grain. Grassroots cadres say: With all the grain weighed, everyone feels clear-headed, and it becomes more practical and reliable to complete the grain purchase tasks and arrange the lives of commune members. The commune members generally reflect: "Weighing and storing grain gives us three assurances: we are assured about grain storage, we are assured about our livelihood, and we are assured about our work." These short and simple words of the broad masses and cadres summarize the benefits of weighing and storing grain, and also show that seriously doing a good job of weighing and storing grain is a major event on the current grain front.

Agriculture is the foundation for developing the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. The current state of grain work has a direct relationship with everyone's life and all sectors of the national economy. The broad masses of people have always been very concerned about the work of grain purchase and distribution. Experience tells us that an important prerequisite for doing a good job of timely grain purchase and distribution is to have a "bottom line" in mind. With a "bottom line," we can determine how much grain to sell to the state, and how much rations, seeds, and fodder to leave for the commune and team; we can determine the ratio of grain consumption and accumulation; and the state can also arrange the needs of all aspects of the national economy for grain based on the purchase quantity. Where does the "bottom line" come from? First and foremost, it comes from weighing and storing. After the grain is harvested, it is inspected and weighed batch by batch, and then sent to the warehouse. The "bottom line" is then in our control. This is a scientific and down-to-earth correct method.

Being down-to-earth and proceeding from reality are the work style and methods that our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have always advocated. No matter when or what we are doing, to make our policies and guidelines conform to objective reality, we must adopt a realistic attitude. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To decide the work policy according to the actual situation is the most basic working method that all Communists must firmly remember." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume 4, page 1306). The same must be true for doing grain work. At present, our broad rural cadres have great determination and high enthusiasm to successfully complete the state's grain purchase plan and arrange the lives of commune members well. They understand that doing a good job in grain work will powerfully promote next year's production and construction, and promote the continued leap forward of the entire national economy. This kind of drive to do a good job and full of revolutionary enthusiasm is good and should be greatly promoted. However, having determination and enthusiasm, or having good subjective wishes, is not enough. To do a good job, we must also look at whether our working methods and work style are good, whether we are down-to-earth, and whether we proceed from reality. If we inspect and weigh the harvested grain and make clear statistics, we can understand the actual situation; if we grasp the actual situation, we can better carry out grain distribution and arrange the lives of the people. Therefore, grain weighing and storage itself is a scientific and down-to-earth task, and to do this work well, we must have a down-to-earth attitude and style. If, after the grain is harvested, it is sent to the warehouse without being weighed, we will inevitably be unclear about the grain yield. Or, even if it is weighed and stored, but in a perfunctory and formalistic way, we still cannot obtain a reliable "bottom line." Using this unscientific attitude to deal with grain storage work, the grain purchase and distribution work will inevitably not be done well.

Perhaps some people think that weighing and storing the huge amount of grain one by one is a very heavy task, too "troublesome." Yes, weighing hundreds of billions of catties of grain one by one, and storing it separately for the state and the collective, the workload is indeed very large and indeed "troublesome." However, this kind of "trouble" is indispensable. Every achievement of our revolutionary cause has never been obtained easily. There are many "troubles" in it. Only by seriously solving these "troubles" can the revolutionary cause continue to move forward. After the lives of the broad masses of people have been collectivized, in order to arrange the lives of the masses well and to accurately implement the principle of planned grain use, it is even more necessary to do a good job of weighing and storing grain. We must see that being proactively "troubled" now is precisely to avoid "trouble" in the future. The example of the Pingyong Production Team in Rongjiang County, Guizhou Province, can well illustrate this point. After the autumn grain was put into storage, this team was unable to finalize the grain distribution plan for a period of time. Why? Originally, in the process of grain storage in this team, some of the grain was not weighed carefully, so everyone was not sure and felt it was not practical. Later, after re-weighing and verifying the quantity, everyone felt clear-headed. The members of this team saw that all the grain was weighed and put into storage, and the living arrangements were in place, and everyone was in a happy mood and had a lot of energy. It can be seen how much impact a realistic and down-to-earth work style has on work. The more important the work, the less room for sloppiness.

Not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of trouble, working in a solid and concrete way, and solving one problem after another in the work, through arduous and meticulous work, to make our subjective understanding conform to objective reality to the greatest extent possible, this is a scientific and realistic work attitude. Our Party organizations at all levels and every relevant cadre must greatly promote this excellent work style in the current grain work.

In order to make the grain weighing and storage work both solid and meticulous, Party committees at all levels should also strengthen organizational leadership. We must make good arrangements for the labor force required for weighing and storage, and implement everything item by item. Whether it is weighing work, bookkeeping work, storage work, or security work, there must be someone in charge. We should select people with high awareness, good background, and impartiality to undertake these tasks. Whether it is grain purchased by the state or grain belonging to the commune and production team, all must be carefully, meticulously, and accurately weighed before being put into storage; in addition to the grain that the state should purchase being sent to state warehouses in a timely manner, the rations, seeds, and fodder grain belonging to the commune and production team must be recorded separately, stored separately, and kept separately according to the grain management system. At the same time, we must establish and improve the responsibility system and storage system on this basis. With a system, and strictly implementing the system, we can truly achieve receipt with evidence, expenditure with basis, accounts consistent with goods, without any confusion; the grain purchase and distribution plan can then be truly implemented. For the few grains that have not been weighed and stored, a thorough inspection should also be carried out, and the commune and team cadres should be organized to re-weigh them in order to finally verify the output.

In the work of weighing and storing grain, we must follow the mass line and absorb a certain number of commune member representatives and cadres to supervise the grain inspection, weighing, bookkeeping, and other work. This is not only conducive to completing the weighing and storage tasks quickly and well, but also helps cadres improve their work style and promote the democratic management system.

Policy is the life of the Party. Correctly implementing the Party's grain policy is the fundamental guarantee for the Party to achieve victory on the grain front. Doing a good job of weighing and storing grain is a very important part of correctly implementing the Party's grain policy. Therefore, it is not only an important economic work, but also an important political work. To do this work well, we must repeatedly publicize the benefits of weighing and storing grain to the broad rural grassroots cadres and masses, and repeatedly explain the Party's grain policy to the masses. As long as we disclose the policy to the masses and let the broad masses of commune members know the situation well, we will surely be able to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and help us do a good job of weighing and storing grain, so that the Party's grain policy can be perfectly implemented.

    发扬踏踏实实的工作作风
    ——论做好粮食过秤入仓工作
    目前全国各地农村正在紧张地进行着一项重要工作，这就是粮食过秤入仓。属于国家征购的粮食过秤进入国家仓库，属于农村留下的种籽、口粮、饲料，过秤进入集体所有的仓库。
    农村人民公社的广大社员群众和干部对粮食过秤入仓工作都表示了普遍重视和热烈支持。基层干部说：粮食全部过秤，大家心里亮堂了，完成征购任务和安排社员生活就更落实，更有把握了。社员们则普遍反映：“粮食过秤入仓有三放心：粮食保管放心，生活放心，干活放心。”广大群众和干部这些简短朴实的话，概括了粮食过秤入仓的好处，也说明了认真做好过秤入仓工作，是当前粮食战线上的一件大事。
    农业是发展国民经济的基础，粮食则是基础的基础。当前粮食工作做得如何，同每个人的生活和一切国民经济部门都有着直接的关系。广大人民群众对粮食的收购和分配工作历来都是十分关心的。经验告诉我们，要及时做好粮食的收购和分配工作，一个重要的前提是要心中有“底”。有了“底”，才能确定交售多少粮食给国家，留下多少口粮、种籽、饲料给社、队；才能确定粮食的消费和积累的比例；国家也才能根据征购数量安排国民经济各方面对粮食的需要。“底”从哪儿来？首先在于过秤入仓。在粮食收获以后，逐项逐批地验收过秤，再送入仓库，“底”就在我们的掌握中了。这是一种科学的、脚踏实地的正确方法。
    脚踏实地，从实际出发，这是我们党和毛泽东同志历来提倡的工作作风和工作方法。不论在什么时候，办什么事情，要使我们的方针政策符合于客观实际，都必须抱着实事求是的态度。毛泽东同志说：“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1306页），做粮食工作也必须这样。目前，我们的广大农村干部对于胜利完成国家粮食收购计划和安排好社员生活的决心很大，热情很高。他们懂得，粮食工作做好了，就会有力地推动明年的生产建设，推动整个国民经济的持续跃进。这种做好工作的干劲和饱满的革命热情是好的，是要大大发扬的。但是，有了决心和热情，或者说有了好的主观愿望，还不够。要做好工作，还要看我们的工作方法、工作作风好不好，要看我们是否脚踏实地，是否从实际出发。把收获下来的粮食验收过秤，统计清楚，我们就能够了解实际情况；掌握了实际情况，我们就能够更好地进行粮食分配和安排生活。所以，粮食过秤入仓本身就是一项科学的、脚踏实地的工作，而要做好这件工作，又必须有脚踏实地的态度和作风。如果在粮食收获下来以后，不经过过秤就送入仓库，我们对粮食的产量必然胸中无数。或者，虽然也过秤入仓，但马虎了草，流于形式，同样也不能得出确实的“底”。用这种不科学的态度对待粮食入库工作，粮食的收购和分配工作也必然是做不好的。
    也许有人认为，把数量十分巨大的粮食都逐一过秤入仓，是一项很繁重的工作，太“麻烦”了。是的，把几千亿斤粮食一笔一笔过秤，分别国家和集体入仓，工作量确实很大，确实
  “麻烦”。然而这种“麻烦”却是不可少的。我们革命事业的每一个成就从来都不是轻而易举地得来的，其中就有许许多多的“麻烦”，只有认真地去解决这些“麻烦”，革命事业才能不断前进。广大人民的生活实现集体化以后，为了很好地安排群众生活，为了准确地实现计划用粮的原则，更必须做好过秤入仓工作。我们要看到，现在主动地“麻烦”些，正是为了以后不“麻烦”。贵州省榕江县平永生产队的事例就很可以说明这个问题。这个队在秋粮入库以后，有一段时间粮食分配方案一直无法定下来。为什么呢？原来这个队在粮食入仓过程中，有一部分粮食没有认真履行过秤的手续，以致大家心中都没有底，都觉得不落实。后来经过重新过秤，核实了数量，大家心里就亮堂了。这个队的社员看见粮食全部过秤入仓，生活安排落实了，个个心情舒畅，干劲大增。可见，实事求是、踏踏实实的工作作风，对工作有多么大的影响。工作越是重要，就越是来不得半点马虎。
    不怕困难，不嫌麻烦，扎扎实实，具体解决工作中一个一个的问题，经过艰苦、细致的工作，使我们的主观认识最大限度地符合于客观实际，这就是科学的、实事求是的工作态度。我们各级党组织、每一个有关的干部在当前的粮食工作中都要大大发扬这种优良的工作作风。
    为了把粮食过秤入仓工作做得既踏实又细致，各级党委还应当加强组织领导。要把过秤入仓所需的劳动力安排好，件件事情都要落实。不论是司秤工作，记账工作，保管工作，保卫工作，都必须有专人负责。应当挑选觉悟高、成份好、办事公道的人担任这些工作。不论是国家征购的粮食，或者公社、生产队的粮食，在入仓以前一律都要认真、仔细、准确地履行过秤手续；除国家应当收购的粮食要及时送进国家仓库外，属于公社和生产队的口粮、种籽和饲料粮，都要根据粮食管理制度，分别记账，分别入仓，分别保管。同时还要在这个基础上建立和健全责任制度和保管制度。有了制度，并且严格执行制度，就能切实做到收有凭，支有据，账货相符，丝毫不乱；粮食的收购和分配计划也才能真正落实。对于少数没有过秤入仓的粮食，也应当进行深入的检查，并组织社、队干部重新过秤，以便最后核实产量。
    在过秤入仓工作中，要走群众路线，吸收一定的社员代表和干部一起到场监督粮食的检验、司秤、记账等项工作。这不仅有利于既快且好地完成过秤入仓任务，而且也有利于帮助干部改进工作作风，有利于发扬民主管理制度。
    政策是党的生命。正确地贯彻执行党的粮食政策，是党在粮食战线上取得胜利的根本保证。做好粮食过秤入仓工作是正确地贯彻执行党的粮食政策的一个十分重要环节，因此，它不仅是一项重要的经济工作，同时也是一项重要的政治工作。要做好这项工作，就必须向广大农村基层干部和群众反复宣传过秤入仓的好处，反复向群众讲清党的粮食政策。只要我们把政策向群众交底，让广大社员胸中有数，就一定能够把群众的积极性充分调动起来，帮助我们做好过秤入仓工作，从而使党的粮食政策得到完满的贯彻。
