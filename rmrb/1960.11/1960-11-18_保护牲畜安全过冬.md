    Protect Livestock Through the Winter
    Store Fodder and Strengthen Management
    In Shanxi Province, the focus is on storing fodder and launching a movement to protect livestock through the winter. In addition to collecting all crop stalks and agricultural by-products, various localities are actively gathering wild grass and leaves from the mountains and plains to serve as winter fodder for livestock. Preliminary statistics show that the province has stored more than 1,000 jin of fodder for each head of livestock.
    While storing fodder, many places have established fodder depots with designated personnel in charge of storage. The "three fix" system of "fixing the number of livestock, fixing the fodder consumption, and fixing the condition" is being widely implemented among feeders, effectively preventing the waste of fodder.
    Build Underground Warm Shelters for Livestock
    In Siping Prefecture, Jilin Province, various communes are actively building underground warm shelters to ensure that pigs, sheep, and large livestock can safely overwinter.
    Last winter, after Siping Prefecture promoted the experience of the Caijia Management Area pig farm in Guojia Township, Lishu County, in building underground warm shelters, it ensured the safe birth of sows and increased the survival rate of piglets by 20% to 30% compared to ordinary pens. This year, various localities are not only building underground warm shelters for pigs but also for large livestock and sheep. As of November 7, more than 13,000 underground warm shelters had been built throughout the prefecture, and existing underground warm shelters had also been repaired.
    Build Sheds and Pens to Receive Winter Lambs
    The Sujitan Commune in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, is actively preparing for winter lambing and rearing. The commune has organized 20 specialized teams to build sheds and pens, repairing old pens and building new ones. Now, breeding ewes have lambing rooms, and lambs have warm *kangs* (heated platforms) (rooms). Eight specialized grass-cutting teams have also been organized.
    Feed Stout Oxen to Welcome Spring Plowing
    The Lutou People's Commune in Zaoyang, Hubei, is comprehensively carrying out "five checks" and "five comparisons" to protect draft cattle through the winter and prepare for spring plowing.
    The "five checks" and "five comparisons" are: check cattle sheds and compare their quality; check the cattle's condition and compare feeding management; check fodder preparation and compare storage quantity; check feeding responsibilities and compare the care of draft cattle; and check leadership and compare the implementation of measures.
    Based on this, production teams and small teams take measures to strengthen feeding management based on the problems identified during the inspection. To strengthen leadership, the commune Party committee established a committee to protect draft cattle through the winter, management areas established guidance groups, and production teams and small teams established groups to protect draft cattle.
    Large and Small Livestock Each Find Their Place
    In the Lijia Production Team of the Ershijiazi Commune in Changtu County, Liaoning, all livestock sheds have been repaired, and sufficient winter fodder has been prepared for the livestock. All seven livestock pens have been fitted with windbreaks, and 17 pigsties have been generally covered with sheds and stacked with walls to face the wind. Twenty-five pigsties have also been built, and 40 warm cellars have been dug to ensure that sows can safely overwinter. Separate feeding of old, weak, and pregnant animals is practiced for large livestock, and pigs are separated by gender, strength, size, and pregnant pigs are kept in single pens. The brigade's 13 weaned foals have been concentrated in the foal rearing farm. A large amount of fodder and feed has been stored, enough for three months of feeding.
    One Township Lacks Grass, Other Townships Support
    Langding Township in Jiangzi County, Tibet, which has less grassland, has solved the difficulty of winter grass shortage with the strong support of Nieru and Gayao Townships, which have more grassland.
    Langding Township has more cattle and sheep and less grassland. The livestock could not gain weight in the autumn. After learning about the difficulties of Langding Township, the herdsmen of Nieru and Gayao Townships agreed to drive more than 3,100 cattle and sheep from Langding Township to the pastures of the two townships for grazing. After more than a month of grazing, the livestock quickly gained weight, and more than 250,000 jin of fodder was saved in the township. This laid the foundation for livestock to overwinter. The herdsmen of Langding Township are very grateful for the help of the herdsmen of Nieru and Gayao Townships. They said that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we herdsmen be so united; in the future, if others have any difficulties, we will certainly do our best to help.
    Carefully Feed to Increase Livestock Condition
    Fuhai County, Xinjiang, is focusing on increasing livestock condition to protect livestock through the winter. At present, nearly 100,000 sheep in the county have reached first-class condition, and 27,000 head of large livestock are also approaching first-class condition. The average weight of general adult ewes is more than 70 kilograms, and the average weight of general lambs of the year is 44 kilograms. This provides a strong guarantee for improving livestock breeding rates and ensuring livestock safety through the winter.
    In strengthening pasture management, herdsmen have generally promoted the method of supplementing saltpeter at any time, which has played a great role in enhancing livestock appetite and strengthening muscles and bones. They have also generally promoted the method of frequent transfers and slow grazing, so that livestock can often eat fresh and delicious grass heads.

    保护牲畜安全过冬
    收贮饲草加强管理
    山西各地以收贮饲草为中心，开展保护牲畜安全过冬的运动。各地除了把所有的农作物秸秆，农副产品全部收集起来以外，还积极收集漫山遍野的野草和树叶，作为牲畜过冬饲草。初步统计，全省已为每头牲畜储备饲草一千多斤。
    在收贮饲草的同时，许多地方建立了饲草库，固定专人保管，对饲养员普遍推行“定牲畜头数、定饲草耗量、定膘情”的制度，有效地杜绝浪费饲草现象。
    给牲畜修地下暖圈
    吉林省四平专区各公社积极修建地下暖圈，保证猪、羊和大家畜安全过冬。
    去冬，四平专区推广了梨树县郭家店公社蔡家管理区养猪场修建地下暖圈的经验后，保证了母猪安全产仔，仔猪成活率比一般圈舍提高了20％到30％。今年，各地不但为猪修建地下暖圈，还为大牲畜和羊修建地下暖圈。到11月7日止，全专区已修建地下暖圈一万三千多间，原有的地下暖圈也都作了修补。
    修棚打圈接冬羔
    青海省海北藏族自治州门源回族自治县苏吉滩公社，正在积极准备冬季接羔育幼工作。全公社组织了修棚打圈专业组二十个，一面整修老圈，一面添打新圈，现已做到母畜有接羔室、羔有暖炕（室）。还组织了八个专业打草组。
    喂壮耕牛迎春耕
    湖北枣阳鹿头人民公社全面开展“五查”“五比”，保护耕牛安全过冬，准备迎接春耕生产。
    “五查”“五比”即：查牛屋，比好坏；查牛膘，比饲养管理；查草料准备，比贮备数量；查饲养责任，比爱护耕牛；查领导，比措施落实。
    在这个基础上，各生产队、小队，根据检查出来的问题，采取措施，加强饲养管理。公社党委为了加强领导，成立了保护耕牛安全过冬委员会，管理区建立了指导小组，生产队、小队成立了保护耕牛小组。
    大小牲畜各得其所
    辽宁昌图县二十家子公社力家生产队，全部畜舍已整修完毕，并为牲畜备足了过冬草料。有七处畜圈全部夹上防风障，十七处猪圈普遍搭好圈棚、垛上迎风墙；还建了二十五间猪舍，挖了四十个暖窖，让母猪安全过冬。对大牲畜采取老弱和孕畜分槽饲养的办法，对猪采取公母分圈、强弱分圈、大小分圈、孕猪单圈饲养的办法，大队的十三头离奶幼驹已经集中到幼驹扶育场。全社贮备了大量饲草、饲料，够三个月喂用。
    一乡缺草各乡支援
    西藏江孜县草场较少的朗丁乡，在草场较多的涅如和嘎耀两乡的大力支援下，解决了冬季缺草的困难。
    朗丁乡的牛羊较多草场较少，牲畜在秋天迟迟抓不上膘，涅如和嘎耀两乡的牧民知道朗丁乡的困难后，同意把朗丁乡的三千一百多头牛羊赶到两乡的牧场上放牧。放牧了一个多月后，牲畜膘很快增加了，并节约了本乡的饲草二十五万多斤。这就为牲畜过冬打下了基础。朗丁乡的牧民们非常感谢涅如和嘎耀两乡牧民的帮助，他们说，只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们牧民才得这样团结；以后别人有什么困难，我们也一定尽力帮助。
    精心饲养增加畜膘
    新疆福海县为保护牲畜过冬，狠抓牲畜增膘工作。目前，全县有近十万只绵羊均达到一等膘，二万七千头大畜也接近一等膘。一般成年母羊体重平均达七十多公斤，一般当年羊羔体重达到四十四公斤。为提高牲畜繁育率和保畜安全过冬，提供了有力保证。
    牧民在加强牧放管理中，普遍推广了随时补饲盐硝的办法，对增进牲畜食欲，强筋健骨，起了很大作用；还普遍推行了勤转移、慢?行的办法，经常让畜群吃到新鲜可口的草头。
