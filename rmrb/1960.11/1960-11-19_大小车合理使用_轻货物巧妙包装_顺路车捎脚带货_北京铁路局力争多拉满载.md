	Rationally Use Large and Small Cars, Skillfully Package Light Goods, and Have Passing Cars Carry Goods as a Sideline
	Beijing Railway Bureau Strives to Haul More and Fill Every Load
	(Our dispatch) The Beijing Railway Bureau, in close collaboration with more than two hundred freight stations and production and sales departments, has launched a mass campaign of skillful loading and full loading, which has increased the tonnage loaded per vehicle.
	The Beijing Railway Bureau recently made a calculation: Comparing January to October of this year with the same period last year, the average load per vehicle per trip has increased by five and a half tons for the entire bureau. However, calculated based on the marked load capacity of freight cars, it only reached 95.9%. If each vehicle could carry one more ton of cargo per trip, it would be possible to transport 200,000 tons more cargo each month, saving more than 4,000 transport vehicles. The main reasons for vehicles not being fully loaded are: first, some goods are light and bulky, making it difficult to reach the marked load capacity. A 30-ton freight car loaded with cotton, when filled, usually only reaches about half of its load capacity; when loaded with reeds and pigs, it only reaches about eight tons. Second, some loading personnel, when loading goods, did not pay attention to both loading quickly and loading well. Sometimes, in order to save time, they used large cars for small loads, or drove away before the car was fully loaded. After the publication of this calculation, it aroused the attention of the staff of various stations. After further clarifying the significance of striving for full loading while striving for fast loading, they actively cooperated with production and sales departments, and, based on the specific situation of the type of vehicle and the goods, promoted and created many methods to increase the load capacity of vehicles.
	First, reasonably use vehicles according to the weight and characteristics of the goods. For large and small cars, they try to use large cars to transport heavy goods such as steel, iron, coal, and sand, to ensure that large cars are fully loaded on every trip; and use small cars to transport light goods, striving to load as much as possible. For high-sided cars and low-sided cars, they try to use high-sided cars to load coal, to ensure that coal cars are fully loaded; low-sided cars are used to transport particularly heavy iron ore, slag, refractory materials, and other goods, which can also be fully loaded.
	Second, vigorously improve the packaging of light goods. The staff made great technical innovations, and successfully tested many kinds of baling machines and new baling methods, which can compress the volume of various light goods without affecting the quality of the goods, in order to strive for more loading. The staff of Qianmotou Station in Shen County, Hebei Province, together with the Shen County Transport Company and the Tianjin Paper Mill, found a way to add a wooden board to the artificial reed baling machine, shortening the length and width of the reed bales, so that each 30-ton freight car could load more than 16 tons of reeds, increasing the load capacity by more than one time. The staff of Tianjin Zhongda Paper Mill, in collaboration with relevant transportation departments, successfully trial-produced a universal hydraulic baling machine, which enabled a 30-ton freight car to load 26.6 tons of reeds. According to statistics, if this baling machine is universally used when transporting the reeds needed by various paper mills in Tianjin, it can save more than 50,000 freight cars per year compared with the past, save 1.33 million workdays of baling and bundling labor, and also reduce the loss rate during transportation from 15% to 5%. The cotton hydraulic baling machine successfully trial-produced by Hengshui Station and the baling factory in Hebei Province increased the loading tonnage of each cotton car from 11 or 12 tons to 21 or 22 tons. The rubber tire rim is empty in the middle, and in the past, each car could only load ten tons. The loading and unloading workers of Tianjin West Station went to the factory that produced the tire rims to study with the production workers, and finally found a way to fold them into small pieces when the tire rims were just formed, so that a 30-ton car could load 30 tons of tire rims, which saved vehicles and freight, and did not affect the quality of the goods. Both the station and the shipping unit were very happy. These advanced packaging tools and packaging methods have begun to be promoted throughout the bureau.
	Third, make full use of the empty tonnage of freight cars, passenger cars, baggage cars, and postal cars to vigorously carry goods as a sideline. Each station first grasps the loading situation of passing trains, moves the scattered goods to the predetermined parking section, and uses the time for the locomotive to load coal and water to quickly load these goods onto the passing cars that have not yet been fully loaded. From January to October of this year, the stations under this railway bureau used this method to transport more than 13 million tons of goods.

### 大小车合理使用  轻货物巧妙包装  顺路车捎脚带货  北京铁路局力争多拉满载

    大小车合理使用  轻货物巧妙包装  顺路车捎脚带货
    北京铁路局力争多拉满载
    本报讯　北京铁路局所属两百多个货运站和产销部门密切协作，开展群众性的巧装满载活动，提高了车辆的装载吨数。
    北京铁路局在不久以前算过一笔账：今年1至10月和去年同期比较，全局每辆车每次平均多装了五吨半货物，但是按货车标记载重量计算，还只达到95.9％。如果每辆车每次能再多装一吨货，每个月就可以多运二十万吨货物，节约四千多辆运输车。车辆不能满载的主要原因，一是部分货物量轻体大，不易达到标记载重量。一个三十吨的货车装棉花，装满一车，一般只能达到载重量的一半左右；装芦苇和猪，都只能达到八吨左右。二是部分装运人员在装货时，没有注意既要装快又要装好，有时为了抢时间，就大车小用，或者车还没有装满就开走。这笔账公布以后，引起了各车站职工的重视。他们在进一步明确认识了争取快装必须同时争取满载的意义以后，积极同产销部门合作，针对车型、货物等具体情况，推行和创造了许多种增加车辆载重量的办法。
    第一，根据货物的重量和特点，合理使用车辆。对于大型车和小型车，他们尽可能选用大型车装运钢、铁、煤、砂石等体重货物，保证大型车趟趟满载；选用小型车装体轻货物，也力争多载。对于高边车和低边车，他们尽可能用高边车装煤，保证煤车满载；低边车则用来装运分量特别重的铁矿石、石渣、耐火材料等货物，同样可以满载。
    第二，大力改进体轻货物的包装工作。职工们大闹技术革新，试验成功许多种打包机械和新的打包方法，可以在不影响货物质量的前提下，将各种体轻货物压缩体积，争取多载。河北深县前磨头车站的职工和深县搬运公司、天津造纸总厂的职工一起，设法在芦苇人工打包机内加了一块木板，缩短了芦苇包的长度和宽度，使每辆三十吨的货车能装十六吨多的芦苇，载重量提高一倍以上。天津中达造纸厂职工和有关运输部门协作，试制成功一种万能油压打包机，使一辆三十吨货车能装芦苇二十六点六吨。据统计，如果运输天津市各造纸厂所需的芦苇时，普遍采用这种打包机，一年可以比过去节约货车五万多辆，节约打包和捆装劳动力一百三十三万工，还可以使途中损耗率由15％降低到5％。河北衡水车站和打包厂共同试制成功的棉花油压打包机，使每车棉花的装车吨数由十一、二吨提高到二十一、二吨。胶皮轮车带中间是空的，过去一车只能装十吨。天津西站的装卸工人到生产车带的工厂同生产工人一起研究，终于找到了在车带刚成型时将它折叠成小块的办法，使三十吨的车能装三十吨的车带，既节省车辆和运费，又不影响货物质量，车站和运货单位皆大欢喜。这些先进包装工具和包装方法已开始在全局推广。
    第三，利用货车、客车、行李车、邮政车等的空余吨位，大搞捎脚运输。各站都事先掌握通过的列车的装载情况，把零星货物搬到预定的停车地段，利用机车上煤、上水等时间，把这些货物迅速装上尚未满载的顺路车捎走。今年1至10月，这个铁路局所属各站就用这种办法运走了一千三百多万吨货物。
