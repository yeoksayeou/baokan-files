    Ode to "Riding the Crest of the Wave"
    Lu Fuwei
    "Riding the crest of the wave" has always been a derogatory term with ironic and dismissive connotations. It brings to mind "following fads," "showing off," and so on. "Riding the crest of the wave" with personal motives is something that should be resolutely opposed. However, "riding the crest of the wave" can also be a commendatory term; many people ride the revolutionary wave for the benefit of the revolution, and it then contains entirely new content.
    To "ride" is because one is unwilling to fall behind. China is a great socialist country, but it is currently still an economically backward country. Precisely because we are "poor and blank," the imperialists dare to bully us, and the revisionists attack us. We must strive for progress, whip the horse faster, and remove the two mountains of poverty and blankness… To "ride" is for the needs of the situation. The revolutionary struggle is like a vast ocean, surging, turbulent, and developing forward in rolling waves. Recently, the Party, based on the needs of the revolution, put forward the main attack direction and called for an advance on agriculture, which requires concentrating superior forces to fight decisive battles. Many comrades are rushing ahead, riding the crest of the revolutionary wave, going to the vast countryside, to the forefront of the struggle, precisely in order to set off a revolutionary high tide and complete the great historical task.
    There are only ripples in ditches, but there are winds and waves on the ocean. There are slow currents and rapid currents in life; there are relatively comfortable and easy places, and there are also boiling hot mass struggles. Marx said: Struggle is happiness. This is the motto of many outstanding revolutionaries. Revolutionaries never covet the tranquility and ease of the ditch like ducks; they yearn for the storm of struggle in the skies above the ocean like petrels. The more arduous, the more difficult, the more revolutionaries are needed. Now, many comrades are rushing to the countryside, depicting the newest and most beautiful pictures in the poorest and blankest places. This fully embodies the noble style of proletarian warriors.
    There have been many warriors in history who dared to "ride the crest of the wave." When the Soviet Union implemented the New Economic Policy, many Communist Party members responded to Lenin's call to engage in civilized business and defeated capitalism. In the early stages of agricultural collectivization, many outstanding workers were sent by the Party committee to lead the agricultural collectivization movement, enabling socialism to occupy the position in the countryside. When the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out in our country, many young students stepped out of the classroom and surged to participate in the anti-Japanese and national salvation activities, rushing to the battlefield. Today, in the great campaign to develop agriculture, many office cadres have raised hoes with the hands that once held pens, and tens of thousands of educated youth have rushed to the agricultural front lines to make great achievements in the vast world of the countryside. These revolutionaries who ride the crest of the revolutionary wave, despite their vast differences in gender, experience, age, and personality, have a common oath: "The needs of the Party are our aspirations!" "Wherever the Party points, we rush there!" "Wherever there are difficulties, we rush there!" They face the crest of the revolutionary wave, with the spirit of charging and breaking through enemy lines, throwing themselves into the torrent of revolutionary struggle, to lay the foundation for the great development and great prosperity of our national economy, and to shoulder heavy burdens. They are the most glorious people, the most happy people. They possess the Party's and the people's infinite expectations and trust, and bear a particularly important responsibility for the development of history.
    The revolution requires us to ride the crest of the revolutionary wave, past, present, and future!

### “赶浪头”颂

    “赶浪头”颂
    陆拂为
    “赶浪头”一直是一个带有讽刺和轻视意味的贬词。它使人联想起“学时髦”、“出风头”等等。抱着个人目的而“赶浪头”的，那是应该坚决反对的。但是，“赶浪头”也可以是褒词，有许多人为革命利益而赶革命的浪头。它就含有全新的内容了。
    赶，是因为不甘落后。中国是一个伟大的社会主义国家，但目前还是个经济落后的国家。正因为我们“一穷二白”，帝国主义才敢欺负我们，修正主义才攻击我们。我们必须发愤图强，快马加鞭，掀掉穷白两座大山……。赶，是为了赶形势的需要。革命斗争如汪洋大海，汹涌澎湃，波浪滚滚，向前发展。最近党根据革命需要提出主攻方向，号召向农业进军，就需要集中优势兵力打歼灭战。许多同志争先恐后，赶革命的浪头，到广大的农村去，到斗争的第一线去，正是为了掀起革命的高潮，完成伟大的历史任务。
    水沟里只有波纹，海洋上才有风浪。生活中有缓流，有激流；有比较安逸舒适的地方，也有沸腾火热的群众斗争。马克思说：斗争就是幸福。这是许多优秀革命者的座右铭。革命者从不像鸭子似的贪恋水沟的平静和安逸，他们像海燕似地渴望海洋上空的斗争风暴。越是艰苦，越是困难，就越需要革命者去。现在，许多同志奔赴农村，在最穷最白的地方，描绘着最新最美的图画。这正充分体现了无产阶级战士的崇高风格。
    历史上有许多这样勇于“赶浪头”的战士。苏联实行新经济政策时，许多共产党员响应列宁的号召去文明经商，战胜了资本主义；农业集体化初期，许多优秀工人被党委派去领导农业集体化运动，使社会主义在农村占领了阵地。我国抗日战争爆发时，许多青年学生跨出课堂，风起云涌参加抗日救亡活动，奔向战场。今天，在大办农业运动中，许多机关干部拿笔的手，举起了锄头，成千上万的知识青年奔赴农业第一线，到农村广阔的天地里去大展鸿图。这些赶革命浪头的革命者，尽管性别、经历、年龄、性格千差万别，但他们有共同的誓言，就是：“党的需要就是我们的志愿！”“党指向哪里，我们就奔向哪里！”“哪里有困难，就奔向哪里！”他们迎着革命的浪头，以冲锋陷阵的精神，投到革命斗争的激流中去，为我国国民经济的大发展、大繁荣去打基础，去挑起了千斤重担。他们是最光荣的人，是最幸福的人。他们拥有党和人民无限的期望和信任，对历史的发展背负着特别重大的责任。
    革命需要我们去赶革命的浪头，过去如此，现在如此，将来也如此！
