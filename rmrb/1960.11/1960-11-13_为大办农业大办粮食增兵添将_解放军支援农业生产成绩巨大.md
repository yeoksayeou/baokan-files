Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The People's Liberation Army (PLA) contingents supporting rural people's communes in the crash "Sanqiu" (Three Autumns: autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing) campaign have recently returned to their units one after another. The characteristics of this year's troop support for "Sanqiu" are: large scale, early action, and high labor enthusiasm, with millions of labor days contributed, truly deploying strong and healthy labor to the forefront of agriculture.

This autumn, under the slogan of "Augmenting agricultural production and grain production," officers and soldiers actively prepared for supporting "Sanqiu," some making tools and repairing vehicles, others learning local farming techniques. Many units in the Beijing, Shenyang, Chengdu, Jinan, and other military regions established "Sanqiu" command posts, linked up with local people's communes, and formulated support plans. As soon as the autumn harvest began, many units suspended military exercises and went to the fields in divisions and regiments to help communes with harvesting and plowing in a large-scale battle. According to incomplete statistics from the Beijing military region, during this period, they helped communes harvest more than 184,000 mu of crops, plow more than 24,800 mu, cultivate and weed more than 15,600 mu, repair more than 152,600 meters of canals, and transport more than 471,000 dan of fertilizer. In the Shenyang military region, troops helped people's communes in more than 20 counties, including Jinxi and Haicheng in Liaoning Province, harvest more than 122,000 mu of soybeans, sorghum, and other crops in just two or three days. The Xinyang Military Subdistrict in Henan organized a labor force, carrying cars, carts, tractors, and so on, to the people's communes in eight counties including Gushi, Queshan, and Zhengyang. In more than half a month, they helped these areas basically complete the harvest of crops and plant most of the wheat. The troops stationed in Yunnan, led by Lieutenant General Chen Kang, suspended military exercises during the autumn harvest to help the people, enabling many areas to complete the autumn harvest and autumn sowing tasks ahead of schedule. The Railway Corps, while completing road construction tasks, also extracted a large number of manpower and organized "expedition teams" to support "Sanqiu." The Shanghai Garrison District often extracts three-quarters of its manpower to support the "Sanqiu" in communes, rushing to harvest and plant. The troops stationed on the Tibetan Plateau had particularly high enthusiasm for helping the people with the autumn harvest this year. They said: Tibetan compatriots have obtained their first bumper harvest year after emancipation, and we must help them harvest the abundant grain.

In supporting "Sanqiu," all troops generally achieved careful harvesting, careful threshing, deep plowing, and careful planting. Under the slogan of "Not a grain lost, not an ear dropped, not a plant rotten, every inch of land must be planted," some troops harvested one piece of land as soon as it was ripe, and planted one piece as soon as it was harvested. Some troops organized inspection and acceptance teams, re-examining each harvested piece of land two or three times.

In supporting "Sanqiu," all troops promoted the glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people. In order to help the communes do more work, some troops set up tents in the fields, eating and sleeping in the fields. Many generals, veteran Red Army soldiers, and soldiers ate, lived, and labored together. Soldiers and commune members also conducted mutual teaching and learning and friendly competitions in the fields. When the officers and soldiers completed the task of supporting "Sanqiu" and returned to their驻地[zhùdì], the commune members beat gongs and drums and sent them off enthusiastically.

    为大办农业大办粮食增兵添将
    解放军支援农业生产成绩巨大
    新华社12日讯　中国人民解放军支援农村人民公社突击“三秋”的队伍，最近陆续返部。今年部队支援“三秋”的特点是：规模大、行动早、劳动热情高，付出的劳动日达数百万个，真正做到身强体壮的劳动力开赴农业第一线。
    今年刚入秋，部队官兵在“为大办农业，大办粮食增兵添将”的口号下，积极进行了支援“三秋”的各种准备，有的制工具、修车辆，有的学习当地的耕作技术。北京、沈阳、成都、济南等地区部队的许多单位还成立了“三秋”指挥部，与驻地人民公社挂钩，订出支援计划。秋收一开始，许多部队就停止操课，成师、成团地开赴田间，以大兵团作战的方式帮助公社收割耕种。据北京地区部队的不完全统计，这期间共帮助公社收割庄稼十八万四千多亩，耕地二万四千八百多亩，整地、锄草一万五千六百多亩，修水渠十五万二千六百多米，运肥四十七万一千多担。沈阳地区部队在两三天内帮助辽宁省锦西、海城等二十多个县的人民公社收割大豆、高粱等十二万两千多亩。河南信阳军分区组织的劳动大军，携带汽车、马车、拖拉机等开赴固始、确山、正阳等八个县的人民公社，半个多月帮助这些地区把庄稼基本收完，小麦大部分种好。驻云南部队在陈康中将带领下，秋收期间停止操课助民秋收，使许多地区提前完成了秋收、秋种的任务。铁道兵在完成筑路任务的同时也抽出大批人力，组织“远征队”等支援“三秋”。上海警备区在支援“三秋”时，经常抽出四分之三的人力到公社抢收、抢种。驻守在西藏高原上的部队，今年助民秋收的热情特别高，他们说：藏胞获得了翻身后的第一个丰收年，我们一定帮助藏胞把丰收的粮食收回来。
    各部队在支援“三秋”时普遍做到了细收、细打、深耕、细种。有的部队在“一粒不丢、一桔不掉、一棵不烂、寸土必种”的口号下，熟一块、收一块，收一块、种一块。有的部队组织了检查验收小组，收割的每一块地都复查两三遍。
    各部队在支援“三秋”时，都发扬了人民军队官兵一致、军民一致的光荣传统。为了帮助公社多干活，有些部队在田间搭起帐篷，吃在田里，睡在田里。许多将军、老红军战士和广大士兵同吃、同住、同劳动。战士和社员在田间还进行互教互学，友谊竞赛。当官兵们完成支援“三秋”任务返回驻地时，社员们都敲锣打鼓，热情相送。（附图片）
