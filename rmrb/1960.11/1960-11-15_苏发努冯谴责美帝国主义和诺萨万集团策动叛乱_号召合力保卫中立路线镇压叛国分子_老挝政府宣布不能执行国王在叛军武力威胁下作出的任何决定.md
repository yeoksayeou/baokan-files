Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 13th: According to a broadcast today by the Pathet Lao Fighting Units Radio, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued a statement condemning U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique for orchestrating a rebellion in Luang Prabang, and announced that it would cooperate with the government and the coup committee to suppress the traitors and defend the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony.

Major Inxieng Singmay, commander of the Third Battalion of the Royal Lao Army, launched a rebellion in Luang Prabang on November 11th. In a broadcast, he openly stated that he no longer recognized the authority of the Vientiane Royal Government.

Souphanouvong's statement said: "U.S. imperialism is increasingly intensifying its interference in Laos and vigorously assisting the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique. They also threatened to stop 'aid' to Laos and incited the Thai reactionaries to besiege and provoke the government of Prince Souvanna Phouma. They used military force to attack Vientiane, coercing the Phouma government and the King to concede to them. In addition, the Phoumi Nosavan clique is also formulating a dictatorial constitution, using its henchmen hidden in the Royal Army and regime to carry out riots in order to overthrow the legitimate regime of the Kingdom and establish their authority and dictatorial government."

The statement pointed out that in order to further realize their above-mentioned plans, the Phoumi Nosavan clique launched a riot in Luang Prabang on November 11th. "Their purpose is to coerce the King and the Phouma government to accept their conditions, namely to stop negotiations with the Lao Patriotic Front, abandon the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, continue the civil war, and create conditions for U.S. imperialism to turn our country into a new type of colony and military base."

The statement said, "Faced with the U.S. imperialist interference and the activities of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, which are seriously threatening our country and people, the Lao Patriotic Front announces: It resolutely opposes the U.S. imperialism and its reactionary running dogs that are intensifying interference in Laos and supporting the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique in betraying the country, religion, the King, and the constitution. The Lao Patriotic Front, together with the people of the whole country, fully supports the statement of the Prince Souvanna Phouma government that all decisions made by the King from now on are made under the coercion of the traitorous clique; and resolutely cooperates with the government and the coup committee to suppress and eliminate the traitors, defend the motherland, religion, the King, and the constitution, and defend the path of peace, neutrality, and national harmony."

The statement said, "In order to smash the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous clique, the Lao Patriotic Front calls on all compatriots across the country, especially the people and patriotic officers and soldiers of the First Military Region, regardless of whether they are farmers, merchants, civil servants, troops, police, students, members of the royal family, or monks, to unite around the Phouma government and the 'Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony, and National Unification', and together with the coup committee and the Lao Patriotic Front, resolutely fight to eliminate the traitorous clique, rescue the King, and defend the motherland, religion, the King, and the constitution."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 13th: According to a broadcast by Vientiane Radio at noon on the 12th, the Lao government held a meeting on the morning of the 12th to study the possible consequences of the rebellion of the Third Battalion in Luang Prabang.

The broadcast said that the Royal Lao Government has announced to the people of the world that the government cannot execute any decisions made by the King under duress.

The broadcast also said that the Royal Government cannot forget that the King does not participate in disputes between parties at any time.

The broadcast said that the Royal Government once again expressed its loyalty to the King. The King has recognized the current Royal Government and the government's political line, namely true national harmony and peaceful neutrality, which is a line that fully conforms to the wishes of the Lao people.

    老挝政府宣布不能执行国王在叛军武力威胁下作出的任何决定
    新华社河内13日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王发表声明，谴责美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团在琅勃拉邦策动叛乱，并宣布将同政府和政变委员会合作，镇压叛国分子，保卫和平中立和民族和睦路线。
    老挝王国军队第三营指挥官英锡相迈少校11月11日在琅勃拉邦发动了叛乱。他在广播中公然说，他不再承认万象王国政府的权力。
    苏发努冯的声明说：“美帝国主义正在日益加强对老挝的干涉，并大力援助富米·诺萨万叛国集团。它们还威胁要停止对老挝的‘援助’，唆使泰国反动派对梭发那·富马亲王政府进行包围和挑衅。利用军事力量进攻万象，要挟富马亲王政府和国王向它们让步。此外，富米·诺萨万集团还正在制订独裁宪法，通过其隐藏在王国军队和政权中的走狗进行暴动，以推翻王国的合法政权，建立它们的权威和独裁政府。”
    声明指出，为了进一步实现它们的上述计划，11月11日，富米·诺萨万集团在琅勃拉邦举行了暴动。“它们的目的是要挟国王和富马亲王政府接受它们的条件，即停止同老挝爱国战线党谈判，放弃和平中立和民族和睦路线，继续内战，为美帝国主义把我国变成新型殖民地和军事基地创造条件。”
    声明说，“面临着正在严重威胁我国和人民的美帝国主义干涉和富米·诺萨万叛国集团的活动，老挝爱国战线党宣布：坚决反对美帝国主义及其反动走狗正在加强对老挝的干涉以及支持富米·诺萨万叛国集团进行背叛国家、宗教、国王和宪法的活动。老挝爱国战线党和全国人民一起，彻底支持梭发那·富马亲王政府关于自此以后国王的一切决定都是在叛国集团要挟下作出的声明；并坚决同政府和政变委员会合作，镇压消灭叛国分子，保卫祖国、宗教、国王和宪法，保卫和平中立和民族和睦路线。”
    声明说，“为了粉碎美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团的阴谋，老挝爱国战线党号召全国同胞，特别是第一军区的人民和爱国官兵，不分农民、商人、公务员、部队、警察、学生、皇族人士和僧侣，团结在富马亲王政府和‘争取和平中立、民族和睦和统一国家委员会’的周围，同政变委员会和老挝爱国战线党一起，坚决为消灭叛国集团、救援国王、保卫祖国、宗教、国王和宪法而斗争。”
    新华社河内13日电　据万象电台12日中午广播，老挝政府12日上午举行会议，研究了第三营在琅勃拉邦的叛变可能带来的后果。
    广播说，老挝王国政府已经向世界人民宣布，政府不能执行国王在武力压力下而作出的任何决定。
    广播还说，王国政府不能忘记的是任何时候国王都不参与各党派之间的争执。
    广播说，王国政府再次表示忠诚于国王。国王曾经承认当前的王国政府和政府的政治路线，即真正的民族和睦和和平中立，这是完全符合老挝人民的愿望的路线。
