More Opinions, More Ideas

Communist Party member Zhang Liang used to work at the Anzhou store in Xushui County, Hebei. Now he has been sent to the Lizhuang Production Team's canteen as a manager.

When he arrived at Lizhuang, he held several meetings to understand the canteen situation, but he didn't get any information. What was going on? Zhang Liang repeatedly pondered the words of the commune Party secretary: "When doing work, you must appear as an ordinary member of the masses."

So Zhang Liang changed his working method and started working with the cooks. When it was time for meals, he served food and vegetables to the commune members, busying himself with the cooks. After finishing the work at the canteen, he went with the cooks to deliver food to the commune members working in the fields. In a few days, Zhang Liang learned about many suggestions from the commune members for improving the canteen. After reporting to the Party branch, he improved the canteen work according to the opinions of the masses.

One evening, Zhang Liang invited the cooks together to discuss the canteen work. Everyone said, "Whether the whole year's livelihood can be arranged well depends on how well we 'calculate'." So, they started calculating. They divided the annual grain ration into segments, months, and then days and meals. After strengthening the planning, the phenomenon of too much or too little food being cooked was eliminated. However, Zhang Liang discovered another problem. The number of people eating each day varied, and the farm work also varied in intensity. What should be done? Based on the opinions of the masses, he came up with the method of "rationing rice according to the number of people." Every day, if the number of people eating in a household changed, they would inform the canteen in advance. Zhang Liang also contacted the production team leader once a day to ask about the work that the commune members would be doing the next day, whether it was light or heavy. In this way, the grain usage plan was more reasonable, and the calculation was better.

    多听意见办法多
    共产党员张亮，原在河北徐水县安州商店工作，现在下放到李庄生产队食堂当管理员。
    他来到李庄，召开了几次会，了解食堂情况，可是什么情况都没摸到。这是怎么回事？张亮反复思索着公社党委书记嘱咐他的话：“做工作，一定要以普通群众的身份出现。”
    于是张亮改变了工作方法，开始同炊事员一起劳动。开饭了，他给社员端饭、盛菜，同炊事员们一起忙活。忙完了家里的，就又同炊事员一起给在地里干活的社员送饭。几天中，张亮了解到社员对改进食堂的许多建议。经过向支部汇报，根据群众意见，改进了食堂工作。
    一天晚上，张亮把炊事员们请在一起，讨论了食堂工作。大家都说：“能不能把全年生活安排好，就看咱们‘算’得怎样了。”于是，他们就算起账来。他们按全年的口粮标准，分到每段、每个月，又分到每天每顿。这样加强了计划性以后，做饭时多时少的现象没有了。可是，张亮又发现了问题。就是每天吃饭的人数有多有少，农活又有轻有重。这怎么办呢？他根据群众的意见，想出了“按人下米”的办法。每天，谁家吃饭的人数有变化，就提前告诉食堂。张亮每天还和生产队长联系一次，问清第二天社员们干什么活，是轻是重。这样，用粮计划更合理，算得更好了。
