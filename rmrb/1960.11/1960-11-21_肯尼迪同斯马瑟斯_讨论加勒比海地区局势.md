Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th - President-elect Kennedy met with Senator Smathers in Palm Beach, Florida, on the 19th to discuss the situation in the Caribbean region.

Smathers is a fervent advocate of American intervention in Cuba, and he has consistently advocated that the United States intensify measures to strangle the Cuban revolution. Kennedy has repeatedly stated during his campaign that he also advocates that the United States take further measures to subvert the Cuban Castro government.

After Kennedy met with CIA Director Allen Dulles on the 18th to hear a "report" on the US government's dispatch of naval and air forces to the Caribbean region, Kennedy's acting press secretary Wilson, when speaking to reporters about the meeting, did not in the slightest indicate that Kennedy did not approve of this action by the Republican government.

    肯尼迪同斯马瑟斯
    讨论加勒比海地区局势
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：当选下届美国总统的肯尼迪19日在佛罗里达州的棕榈海滩会见了参议员斯马瑟斯，同他讨论了加勒比海地区局势。
    斯马瑟斯是美国干涉古巴的狂热鼓吹者，他一直主张美国加紧采取措施来绞杀古巴革命。而肯尼迪在竞选中已多次表明，他也主张美国进一步采取措施来颠复古巴卡斯特罗政府。
    在肯尼迪18日会见了中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯，听取关于美国政府派遣海空军前往加勒比海地区的“汇报”以后，肯尼迪的代理新闻秘书威尔逊在对新闻记者谈到这次会见时完全没有丝毫表明肯尼迪不赞成共和党政府这一行动的表示。
