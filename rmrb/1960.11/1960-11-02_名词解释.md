Explanation of Terms

	Coke Load: In blast furnace ironmaking, materials are added in batches, each batch including coke, ore, limestone, etc. The ratio of the amount of ore to the amount of coke in a batch (such as one to one or one to two) is called the coke load. The volume of the blast furnace is limited. If there is more ore and less coke, the coke load is high, and more iron is produced. If there is less ore and more coke, the coke load is low, and less iron is produced.

	Coke Ratio: Refers to the tons of coke consumed to smelt one ton of pig iron.

	Total Coke Ratio: Refers to the total consumption of coke from the time it leaves the coke oven to the time it enters the furnace, including losses during transportation, storage, and processing.

	Coke Ratio into the Furnace: Refers to the consumption of coke after it enters the furnace. The lower the coke ratio, the more ore can be melted with the same amount of coke, so the lower the coke ratio, the higher the pig iron output.

	Smelting Intensity: Refers to the tons of coke burned per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day and night. If the coke ratio remains unchanged, increasing the smelting intensity means adding more materials to the blast furnace and accelerating ore smelting, which can greatly increase pig iron production.

    名词解释
    焦炭负荷　高炉炼铁是一批一批把料加进去的，每批料里包括焦炭、矿石、石灰石等。一批料中矿石和焦炭数量的比值（如一比一或一比二）就叫焦炭负荷。高炉的容积是有限的，矿石多，焦炭少，焦炭的负荷就大，产铁就多；矿石少、焦炭多，焦炭的负荷就小，产铁就少。
    焦比　指冶炼一吨生铁所消耗焦炭的吨数。
    全焦比　指焦炭从出焦到入炉前的整个过程中的消耗，包括运输、保管、加工中的损耗。
    入炉焦比　指焦炭入炉后的消耗。焦比愈低，就意味着同样数量的焦炭能够熔化更多的矿石，因而焦比愈低，生铁产量也就愈高。
    冶炼强度　指每立方米高炉容积一昼夜燃烧焦炭的吨数。在焦比不变的情况下，提高冶炼强度就意味着多向高炉下料，加速矿石冶炼，因而能大大增加生铁产量。
