Implementing "Four Fixes" and "Four Implementations"
    The Xiang Production Team Canteen in Xi'an Gets Better and Better

    (Our Dispatch) The Xiang Production Team of Anxiang Commune in Xinle County, Hebei Province, has been running its canteen better and better by adhering to the principle of democratic canteen management and implementing "Four Fixes" and "Four Implementations."

    Fixed Canteen Scale
    All members of this production team participate in the canteen. Initially, due to a lack of experience in running canteens, several production teams shared one canteen, which delayed mealtimes and made it difficult to arrange grain consumption plans and develop household production, preventing the integration of life and production. After fully mobilizing the masses and repeatedly discussing with the team members, the Party branch decided to form seven canteens based on small teams. In this way, each canteen had roughly the same number of households and people, generally around forty households, or one hundred fifty to sixty people. Cadres and team members believe that running canteens by small teams has five major benefits: first, it is easier to establish confidence in running the canteen well in the long term and a sense of responsibility for living a good life; second, it is easier to arrange production and life in a unified way in terms of the use of land, labor, livestock, and farm tools; third, it promotes the household production of the canteen; fourth, it can guarantee the rational distribution of team members' surplus grain, etc., and concretely implement the policy of "three guarantees and one reward"; fifth, it facilitates the organization of team members' political, cultural, and recreational activities.

    Fixed Cooks and Managers
    In the past, some canteens in this production team did not have fixed cooks. Instead, team members took turns cooking, resulting in meals not being served on time every other day, and the amount of food being either too much or too little. In response to these problems, the Party branch strengthened the organization, rectification, and ideological education of cooks, based on the principle of relying on poor and lower-middle peasants to run the canteen well. "Five-good" team members who had good backgrounds, good thinking, good labor, diligence, and good service attitudes were democratically elected by the masses to be cooks. Among the twenty-eight cooks in the seven canteens of the entire team, there are thirteen Party members, eight Youth League members, and the rest are team members from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, and it is made clear that they generally will not be transferred.

    Fixed Cooking Utensils
    In the past, due to the lack of management systems, there had been cases where furniture was broken and no one repaired it, and small cooking utensils were lost and no one looked for them. Branch Secretary Lu Kaoye held discussions with team members and cooks, and after research by the branch and discussion by team members, it was decided to fix the cooking utensils to the canteen and assign responsibility to individuals. All canteens universally inventoried all cooking utensils, classified and numbered them, registered them one by one, and designated special personnel for management. A "three guarantees" and "five fixes" responsibility system was adopted, with cadres guaranteeing the canteen, stove, and management, and cooks fixing personnel, cooking utensils, usage, repairs, and rewards.

    Fixed Vegetable Plots
    In the past, vegetable plots were not fixed, and some small teams were unwilling to apply more fertilizer or make a big investment in planting vegetables. Some canteens even planted grain on the vegetable plots. Based on the opinions of the team members, the branch fixed the vegetable plots and team members' private plots last spring, and clarified that the vegetables grown by that canteen would be eaten by that canteen, and the brigade would not allocate them. The income from the vegetable plots would be used by the canteen that planted them, and the brigade would not deduct any. This stimulated the enthusiasm of each canteen for planting vegetables. This autumn, in addition to planting vegetables in the squares and gardens, they also reclaimed 130 mu of wasteland and idle land to grow vegetables, and intercropped turnips, radishes, and other autumn vegetables on 280 mu of land with sweet potatoes, millet, cotton, and other crops.

    Implementation of Grain-Saving Policy
    Each canteen in this team implements a system of "fixed quantity per person, quotas to households, eating with tickets, and saving for oneself." Based on the different circumstances of adults, children, and single people, they are divided into different levels, and quotas are assigned per person based on households, and tickets are issued according to the quantity. The canteen has formulated grain tickets and vegetable tickets with different quantities, which are issued every seven days, and the amount of food consumed is controlled by the individual; settlements are made every ten days, and the accounts are reconciled every ten days. Grain is given for grain saved and money is given for money saved. In this way, saving grain is formalized into a system that everyone abides by. Currently, the seven canteens have more than 30,000 jin of reserve grain.

    Implementation of Policies to Reward Household Production
    The livestock and poultry raised by the canteen are at the disposal of the canteen itself. The seven canteens of the entire team now raise 370 pigs, 140 chickens, and 200 rabbits. In the past year, each canteen sold a total of 68 fat pigs, more than 100 rabbits, and more than 700 jin of fresh eggs to the state, plus the income from other poultry and livestock, totaling more than 4,000 yuan. This has basically solved the canteen's petty expenses.

    Implementation of the Policy of Democratic Canteen Management
    The Xiang Production Team Party Branch summarizes the experience of running the canteen democratically as follows: one visit (cadres visit and solicit team members' opinions), two invitations (invite experienced old farmers to share their wisdom), three discussions (hold forums for poor and lower-middle peasant team members), four summaries (frequently democratically summarize the experience of running the canteen), five inspections (mobilize team members to inspect the work of the canteen), and six improvements (continuously improve the management of the canteen according to the requirements of team members). During his door-to-door visits, Branch Secretary Lu Kaoye solicited the opinions of team members. Team member Lu Luoya said, "The managers haven't cleared the accounts for several months. What are they thinking? The team members don't know." The branch analyzed the team members' opinions and believed that running the canteen well and improving life was everyone's business and everyone's responsibility. Therefore, the Party branch, on the one hand, educated cadres, cooks, and managers and insisted on the principle of democratic canteen management; on the other hand, it democratically formulated and revised the canteen's rules and regulations, achieving daily account clearing, monthly balances, and public announcements every seven days, and settled accounts with team members for saved grain and meal tickets every ten days.

    Implementation of "Four-izations"
    Led by the Party branch of this production team, each canteen, in the spirit of the "poor stick," vigorously promoted the "four-izations" (mechanization of rice and flour processing, mechanization of ventilation, self-flowing water pipes, and canteen sanitation), mobilized the masses to study solutions item by item, and designated special personnel for experimentation. Carpenter Zhang Luosi visited Shangfang Village, fifty li away, and quickly made five blowers. Now, the 38-horsepower portable boiler, in addition to irrigating 150 mu of land every day, can also process more than 20,000 jin of grain, which not only meets the needs of the masses of the entire team to eat rice and noodles, but also increased income by more than 5,000 yuan in half a year and recovered more than 80,000 jin of rice bran.

### 实行“四固定”、“四落实”  西安香生产队食堂越办越好

    实行“四固定”、“四落实”
    西安香生产队食堂越办越好
    本报讯　河北省新乐县安香公社西安香生产队，由于坚持民主办食堂的原则，实行“四固定”、“四落实”，食堂越办越好。
    固定食堂规模
    这个生产队的全体社员都参加了食堂。开始，由于缺乏办食堂的经验，几个生产队办一个食堂，开饭耽悞时间，也不便于安排用粮计划和发展家底生产，使生活和生产不能很好的结合。党支部经过充分发动群众，反复和社员商量，确定以小队为单位，全队组成了七个食堂。这样，每个食堂的户数、人数，大体相等，一般四十户左右，一百五、六十口人。干部、社员认为由小队办食堂有五大好处：一、便于树立长期办好食堂的信心和过好大日子的责任感；二、在土地、劳力、耕畜、农具的使用上，便于生产和生活统一安排；三、促进了食堂的家底生产；四、可以保证社员的超产粮等进行合理分配，具体地贯彻“三包一奖”的政策；五、便于组织社员的政治、文化、娱乐等活动。
    固定炊事员管理员
    这个生产队有些食堂过去没有固定的炊事员，由社员轮班作饭，结果三天两头不能准时开饭，做的饭不是多就是少。党支部针对这些问题，本着依靠贫农、下中农办好食堂的原则，加强了对炊事人员的组织整顿和思想教育工作。由群众民主选出了成份好、思想好、劳动好、勤俭好、服务态度好的“五好”社员当炊事员。全队七个食堂，二十八个炊事员中，有党员十三名，团员八名，其余都是贫农、下中农成份的社员，并明确一般情况下固定不动。
    固定炊事用具
    过去，食堂的用具，由于缺少管理制度，曾出现了家具坏了没人修，小炊具丢了没人找的现象。支部书记卢考业和社员、炊事人员进行了座谈，又经过支部研究，社员讨论，确定把炊具固定到食堂，责任落实到人。各个食堂对所有炊具普遍进行了清点，分类编号，逐件登记，确定专人管理。并采取了干部包食堂、包灶、包管理，炊事员定人、定炊具、定使用、定修理、定奖励的“三包”、“五定”责任制。
    固定菜地
    过去菜地不固定，有些小队种菜就不肯多施肥，不肯下大本。有的食堂还把菜地种上粮食。支部根据社员的意见，从去年春季就把食堂的菜地、社员自留地固定下来，并明确那个食堂种的菜由那个食堂吃，大队不调拨，菜地收入那个食堂种的那个食堂用，大队不扣。这样，启发了各个食堂种菜的积极性。今年秋季，他们除种好蔬菜方和园地外，还开垦荒地、闲地种菜一百三十亩，利用甘薯、谷子、棉花等作物间作蔓菁、萝?等秋菜二百八十亩。
    节约用粮政策落实
    这个队各食堂实行“以人定量、指标到户、凭票吃饭、节约归己”的制度，根据大人、小孩以及单身汉等不同情况划分等级，以户为基础，以人定量，按量发票。食堂制定了数量不同的粮票、菜票，七天一发，吃多少，自己支配；十天一清算，十天一兑现。节约户要粮给粮，要钱给钱。这样，把节约粮食形成制度，人人遵守。现在，七个食堂已有储备粮三万多斤。
    奖励家底生产的政策落实
    食堂所养的家畜家禽归食堂自行支配。全队七个食堂现在已养猪三百七十口，鸡一百四十只，兔二百只。一年来，各食堂共卖给国家肥猪六十八口，兔一百多只，鲜蛋七百多斤，加上其他家禽家畜收入，共达四千多元。基本上解决了食堂的零用开支。
    民主办食堂的方针落实
    西安香党支部总结民主办好食堂的经验是：一访（干部登门拜访，征求社员意见），二请（把过日子有经验的老农请来献宝），三座谈（召开贫农、下中农的社员座谈），四总结（经常民主总结办食堂的经验），五检查（发动社员检查食堂工作），六改进（按照社员的要求不断改进食堂管理）。支部书记卢考业在登门拜访中，征求社员的意见，社员路洛亚说：“几个月管理员不清账，究竟怀着什么心，社员也摸不清。”支部分析社员的意见，认为办好食堂，搞好生活，是大家的事，人人有责。于是，党支部一方面向干部、炊事员、管理员进行教育，坚持民主办食堂的原则；一方面民主制定与修改了食堂的规章制度，达到了账目日清月结，七天一公布，对社员节约的粮票、饭票十天一算账。
    “四化”落实
    这个生产队党支部领导各食堂以“穷棒子”精神，大搞“四化”（米面加工机械化、鼓风机械化、水管自流化、食堂卫生化），发动群众逐项研究办法，确定专人试验。木匠张洛思到五十里地以外的上方村去参观访问，很快就制成了五个鼓风机。现在，三十八马力的锅驼机，每天除浇地一百五十亩外，还能加工两万多斤粮食，不但满足了全队群众吃米吃面的要求，半年来还增加收入五千多元，收回谷糠八万多斤。（阎梦吉、胡富才、田东维）
