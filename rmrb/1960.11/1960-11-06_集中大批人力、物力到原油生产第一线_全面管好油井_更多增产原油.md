    This newspaper reports: In the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on grain and steel, the Yumen Petroleum Administration achieved an all-round leap forward in various tasks and increased crude oil production significantly. By the end of September, the bureau's crude oil production had completed 75% of the annual state plan.

    In order to strive for high-speed oilfield development and rapidly raise crude oil production to a new level, the Yumen Petroleum Administration, while strengthening geological exploration, oilfield construction, and crude oil refining, concentrated a large amount of manpower and material resources on the front line of crude oil production. They adopted the method of fighting annihilating battles to develop oilfields, comprehensively manage oil wells, and ensure better completion of this year's crude oil production plan to support the sustained leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production. Strengthening oil well repair work and increasing the number of producing wells are important measures to ensure a substantial increase in crude oil production. In order to implement this production increase measure, the Yumen Petroleum Administration, in response to the key problem of weak well repair forces failing to keep up with the needs of oil production, first expanded the well repair team. While giving full play to the role of professional well repair teams, it also established more than one hundred well repair teams to carry out a mass well repair campaign. In order to repair more wells, repair wells faster, and repair wells well, the Laojunmiao Oil Production Plant conducted a detailed survey of all oil wells, formulated repair measures according to the wells, and ensured that a batch was repaired and put into production. Strengthening the well repair work has ensured the normal production of oil wells and increased the production of a large amount of crude oil. According to incomplete statistics, in the first nine months of this year alone, the discontinued wells and oil wells with abnormal production repaired by the Laojunmiao Oil Production Plant increased the national crude oil production by about 30,000 tons. The Party Committee of the Ya'erxia Oil Production Plant strengthened the ideological education of employees in the rapid well repair competition, formulated a competition method of one battle every three days, one evaluation every three days, one campaign every month, and one reward every month, and carried out counterpart competitions and opponent competitions between teams, classes, and individuals. This not only quickly broke through the deep well repair barrier, but also increased the average well repair speed by 22.9%, with a success rate of 96.4%, ensuring a steady increase in crude oil production. In August, the plant completed the monthly oil production plan ahead of schedule. In mid-September, the plant's crude oil production increased by another 8.5% compared with the first ten days of the month.

    In order to improve the utilization rate of oil wells, while vigorously grasping well repair work, oil production workers also adopted the method of special personnel, special wells, and special measures to further strengthen oil well management. Many districts and mines have established oil well management groups with the participation of leading cadres, technical personnel, and veteran workers, and promptly conduct "consultations" on oil wells with abnormal oil production, so that the utilization rate of oil wells and the oil production rate are continuously improved.

### 集中大批人力、物力到原油生产第一线  全面管好油井　更多增产原油

    集中大批人力、物力到原油生产第一线
    全面管好油井　更多增产原油
    本报讯　玉门石油管理局在以粮、钢为中心的增产节约运动中，实现了各项工作全面跃进，增产了大量原油。到9月底止，全局原油生产已完成全年国家计划的75％。
    为了力争高速度开发油田，迅速把原油生产提高到一个新的水平，玉门石油管理局在加强地质勘探、油田建设、原油炼制的同时，把大批人力、物力集中到原油生产第一线，用打歼灭战的方法，开发油田，全面管好油井，保证更好地完成今年原油生产计划，支援国家工农业生产持续跃进。加强油井修理工作，增加油井开井数，是保证原油生产大幅度增产的重要措施之一。为了执行这项增产措施，玉门石油管理局针对修井力量薄弱，赶不上采油需要的关键问题，首先扩大了修井队伍。在充分发挥专业修井队作用的同时，又先后成立了一百多个修井队，开展群众修井运动。老君庙采油厂为了多修井、快修井、修好井，对全部油井进行了详细摸底，按井制订了修理措施，做到了修好一批，投入生产一批。修井工作加强以后，保证了油井正常生产，增产了大批原油。据不完全的统计：今年前九个月，仅老君庙采油厂修好的停产井和生产不正常的油井，就给国家增产原油三万吨左右。鸭儿峡采油厂党委在快速修井竞赛当中，加强了职工思想教育工作，制订了三天一个战斗，三天一次评比，一月一个战役，一月一次奖励的评比竞赛办法，在队与队、班与班、人与人之间开展了对口赛和对手赛，不仅很快突破了深井修井关，而且使修井速度平均提高了22.9％，成功率达到96.4％，保证了原油产量的稳步上升。8月份，这个厂提前完成月度采油计划，9月中旬，全厂的原油产量比上旬又提高8.5％。
    为了提高油井利用率，采油工人们在大抓修井工作的同时，还采取专人、专井、专措施的办法，进一步加强了油井管理。许多区队、矿场成立了有领导干部、技术人员和老工人参加的油井管理小组，对出油情况不正常的油井，及时进行“会诊”，使油井利用率和采油时率不断提高。
