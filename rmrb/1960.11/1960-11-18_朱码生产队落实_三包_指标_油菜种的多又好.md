Zhu Ma Production Team Implements "Three Guarantees" Targets
Rapeseed Planted More and Better

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Zhu Ma Brigade of the Dongfeng Commune in Lianshui County, Jiangsu Province, has comprehensively and deeply implemented specific policies for planting rapeseed. By the 12th, it had successfully completed the transplanting of 266 mu of rapeseed, with better quality than last year.

    After sowing part of the rapeseed, the brigade conducted a timely summary. The summary revealed that some commune members did not have a deep enough understanding of the rapeseed planting policy, and had some opinions on the "Three Guarantees" of guaranteed production targets and guaranteed work quotas. The brigade party branch took measures to specifically implement the following policies:

    1. Revise the unreasonable parts of the original "Three Guarantees" to make the targets positive and reliable, with room for exceeding them.

    2. Implement the principle of voluntary mutual benefit and equivalent exchange to solve the problem of rapeseed seedling shortages. Because the amount of seedlings cultivated varied from team to team and household to household within the brigade, when carrying out cooperation and mutual adjustment, it was ensured that it was voluntary, mutually beneficial, priced according to quality, paid by the catty, and reasonably fulfilled. Different prices were determined for different rapeseed seedlings according to local market prices. Without affecting commune members' "side-of-house" rapeseed production, the production teams purchased seedlings enough to plant 60 mu of rapeseed, effectively solving the problem of rapeseed seedling shortages.

    3. The rapeseed planted by the canteen in spare fields, gaps, and reclaimed wasteland is self-planted, self-harvested, and self-used. A small amount of "side-of-house" gap land that is not suitable for collective management, such as scattered land in front of and behind commune members' houses, can be planted by commune members using spare time or holidays, and whoever plants it harvests it.

    Because the brigade earnestly implemented the above policies, in addition to successfully completing the planting plan, the team canteens and individual commune members also planted more than 40 mu of rapeseed using "side-of-house" land.

### 朱码生产队落实“三包”指标  油菜种的多又好

    朱码生产队落实“三包”指标
    油菜种的多又好
    本报讯　江苏省涟水县东风公社朱码大队全面深入地贯彻了种植油菜的具体政策，到12日，已胜利完成了二百六十六亩油菜的移栽任务，质量也比去年好。
    这个大队在播种一部分油菜后及时进行了总结。总结中发现，有些社员对油菜的种植政策了解不够深透，对“三包”的包产指标和包工数还有些意见。大队党支部就采取措施，具体贯彻了以下几项政策：
    一、修订原订“三包”的不合理部分，使指标订得积极可靠，有产可超。
    二、贯彻自愿互利、等价交换的协作原则，解决油菜缺苗问题。这个队因小队与小队、户与户育苗多少不一，在开展协作互相调剂时，切实做到自愿互利、按质论价、按斤计酬、合理兑现。并根据当地市价确定不同菜苗的不同价格。各生产小队在不影响社员“十边”油菜生产的前提下，共收购了可栽六十亩油菜的秧苗，有效地解决了油菜的缺苗问题。
    三、食堂利用零田、隙地和开垦生荒种植的油菜，自种、自收、自用；少量的不适宜集体经营的“十边”隙地，如社员家前屋后的零星地等，社员可以利用工余时间或假日栽种、谁种谁收。
    由于大队切实贯彻了上述政策，全队除胜利完成种植计划外，小队食堂和社员个人，还利用“十边”种了四十多亩油菜。
