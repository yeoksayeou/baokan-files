    New Type of Rural Market
    By Xinhua News Agency reporters Feng Xianghe, Wang Zhihan, Wang Dazhong

    In this season of crisp autumn weather, we arrived in Changtu County, one of the main grain-producing areas of Liaoning Province. Commune members are busily harvesting in the fields where crops have ripened. The scene of a bumper harvest brings boundless excitement to the people, and it also adds a prosperous atmosphere to the rural market after the communization.

    In previous years, at this time, the large and small stores in the city and the supply and marketing cooperatives in the towns would start to get busy, with people rushing from the countryside to sell local and sideline products and buy various daily necessities. This year, this situation has disappeared. Neither the state-owned stores in the county seat nor the supply and marketing cooperatives in the towns are as crowded as in previous years. However, the purchase and sales business of the commercial departments is more prosperous than in any other year. We were very surprised by this change at first, but after visiting the rural market of the Cilu Commune, these doubts were completely dispelled.

          New Market in Huajia Village

    At noon on September 17, Huajia Village, a production team of the Cilu Commune with only sixty-odd households, was bustling. This small village, which had never had a store, suddenly became a lively market. This is the canteen market organized by the Cilu Supply and Marketing Cooperative to adapt to the new situation in the countryside. This is already the third time. Because it is the season of autumn harvest and changing seasons, there are especially many people buying and selling things, and the goods brought by the supply and marketing cooperative are more complete. In the courtyard of the canteen, the stalls are lined up in a row, and the dazzling array of production materials and daily-use industrial products attracts hundreds of thousands of commune members. The stalls for purchasing sideline products stretch from the center of the courtyard to the small open space next door. Barbers, photographers, shoe repairers… all have chosen their appropriate business locations. Commune members who have finished lunch are either busy going home to fetch things they plan to sell, or they go to the stalls to choose the items they need. Commune members from nearby villages three to five miles away also bring eggs and waste products, and come one after another.

    A middle-aged commune member came out of the canteen, squeezed through layers of people, and found the place where sickles were sold. He chose a sickle and said happily, "I had a lot of trouble cutting rice in the morning. Now that I have a new sickle, I can have a good competition with them." An old man holding a pair of half-worn cloth-lined shoes consulted with the shoe repairer: "Comrade! Can you quickly nail a pair of soles for me? I'm waiting to go back to feed the livestock." In less than ten minutes, the old man walked away happily with his repaired shoes. At the photo service, an old man in his seventies led his daughter, daughter-in-law, and grandson to take a photo. As soon as the old man saw the photographer, he said, "I haven't taken a photo in more than ten years. Take a 'family portrait' for us this time!"

    More and more people came, and the transaction became more and more busy. Men, women, old people with crutches, and students wearing red scarves crowded the spacious canteen courtyard. Seeing that the salespeople were too busy to cope, two waiters from the canteen came out to help. The place for purchasing sideline products was even more difficult to handle, so the purchase and sales liaison officer of the team also became a temporary purchaser. Although the transaction in this lively market is very concentrated, it is busy but not chaotic, and very orderly. The commune members have things to buy and sell, and everyone is happy.

          The Joy of the Production Team Leader

    The commune members are most concerned about production. Their desire to strive for a bumper grain harvest can be fully seen from the scene of scrambling to buy autumn harvest tools. In front of the production materials stalls, it was very crowded. Some were fiddling with wooden rakes, and some were picking out rope loops, but the most transactions were still for the sickles and whetstones that commune members personally used in the autumn harvest. After commune members Li Huiling and Li Pu of the Majia Production Team bought the whetstones, they sat in front of the window of the courtyard service station and sharpened their sickles. While sharpening the knife, Li Pu said to Li Huiling: "The supply and marketing cooperative is really thoughtful. We can do everything while eating. We will definitely be able to do more work in the afternoon."

    In the crowd, a commune member said to the several people standing next to him, "The supply and marketing cooperative has brought everything we registered last time. The ones for the cart are here, and the ones for threshing are there. This time we have to buy everything. You have to watch carefully!" While helping those people choose, he muttered to himself: "Without this market, we would have to send people to the town by cart to buy them." This person was originally Gao Zhanfa, the captain of the Huajia Team. On this day, he led the production group leader and the cart team leader to buy more than a dozen kinds of farm tools such as forks and brooms. When talking about the canteen market, he told us with a very satisfied tone: "In the past, commune members had to walk 20 miles back and forth to buy things, which took most of the day. It is more convenient to set up a service station than before, but there are not many kinds of goods, and they still have to run to the market town twice a month. Since there is a regular canteen market, fewer commune members ask for leave, so the attendance rate has increased by 20% in the past two months. What's more, commune members can also sell sideline products to the state at each market. In the past, it was not worth running to sell some scattered things, but now it's different. No matter how much or how little, it supports the country's construction and increases the income of the commune members. It's really a win-win situation."

          Took Care of Urgent Needs

    The commune members praised the supply and marketing cooperative for being so thoughtful. Before the weather turned cold, window paper was delivered. It was the time to pickle vegetables, and a large truckload of sea salt was brought in. Moreover, some varieties that had not been seen a few days ago, such as yellow tobacco, biscuits, and soda, were also put out on this day's market. Because the work of the supply and marketing cooperative was meticulous, and the investigation was conducted in advance through the purchase and sales liaison officers and the stationed team members, they had already prepared for the special needs of each household. Zhong Zhenhua, an old commune member, had a sick grandson. After the liaison officer and the stationed team members found out, they notified the supply and marketing cooperative and asked them to bring some biscuits and white sugar. As soon as the market started that day, Grandma Zhong took a pound of biscuits and a packet of white sugar from the salesman.

    The time for work in the afternoon arrived, and the commune members left the market one by one. The salesmen calculated that in less than two hours, they had purchased more than 30 kinds of items such as eggs, medicinal materials, fibers, and waste products, worth more than 500 yuan; they supplied various production materials and living materials worth more than 1,100 yuan, which is equal to the purchase and sales volume at home for four days in the past.

### 新型的农村集市

    新型的农村集市
    新华社记者　冯向和　王智翰　王大中
    在秋高气爽的季节，我们来到了辽宁省主要粮食产区之一的昌图县。社员们在一块块作物已经成熟的田地里紧张地忙着收割。一片丰收景象，给人们带来无限的兴奋，也给公社化以后的农村市场增加了繁荣气氛。
    在往年，一到这个时候，城里的大小商店和市镇的供销社就开始忙起来，人们从乡下赶到这里，出售土、副产品，购买各种日用品。今年，这种情况不见了，无论是县城的国营商店，或是城镇的供销社，都不像历年那样拥挤。然而，商业部门的购销业务却比任何一年都兴旺。我们对这种变化，开始感到很奇怪，但在访问了此路公社的农村市场，这种疑虑完全解除了。
          华家村的新市场
    9月17日中午，此路公社的一个生产小队，仅有六十几户人家的华家村沸腾了。这个从来没有过商店的小村庄，突然变成了热闹的市场。这就是此路供销社适应农村新情况所组织的食堂集市。这已经是第三次了。因为正值秋忙和换季的季节，买卖东西的人特别多，供销社带来的商品也更齐全。在食堂的院里，货摊一字排开，琳琅满目的生产资料、日用工业品，吸引了成百上千的社员，收购副业产品的摊子从院心拉到右邻的小空场；理发员、摄影师、修鞋工人……都选定了自己合适的营业场址。吃完午饭的社员，有的忙着回家去取准备出售的东西，有的走到货摊跟前选择需用的物品，附近三里五村的社员也拿着鸡蛋、废品，陆陆续续地赶来。
    一个中年社员从食堂出来，挤过层层的人群，找到了卖镰刀的地点。他选好一把镰刀，高兴地说：“上午割谷子，费了好大的劲，这回有了新镰刀，可以好好和他们比赛一场了。”一位老大爷拿着一双半旧的布夹鞋，找修鞋工人商量：“同志！你能不能快些给我钉副鞋掌，我等着回去喂牲口。”不到十分钟，老人带着修好的鞋子高高兴兴地走开了。在照像服务处，一位七十多岁的老大爷领着闺女、儿媳、孙子来照像，老人家一见到摄影师就说：“十几年没照像了，这回给我们照个‘全家福’！”
    人越来越多，交易越来越忙。男的，女的，拄拐杖的老人，系红领巾的学生，把宽敞的食堂大院挤得水泄不通。看营业员忙得不可开交，食堂两名服务员也出来支援。收购副业产品的地方，更是难以应付，于是小队的购销联络员也成了临时收购员。这场热闹的集市，虽然交易很集中，但是忙而不乱，很有秩序，社员们有买有卖，人人欢欢喜喜。
          生产队长的喜悦
    社员们最关心的是生产，他们力争粮食丰收的心情，从争相购买秋收工具的场面中，就可以完全看到。生产资料货摊前面，十分拥挤，有的摆弄木?，有的挑选绳套，但是成交最多的还是社员个人在秋收中随身使用的镰刀和磨石。马家生产小队社员李毁令和李圃两人把磨石买到手以后，就坐在大院服务站的窗前磨起镰刀来。李圃一边磨刀一边对李毁令说：“供销社想的真周到，吃饭的工夫啥事都办了，下午一定能多出活。
    在人群中，有个社员向站在他身旁的几个人说：“咱们上次登记的东西，供销社都给带来了，大车用的在这儿，打场用的在那儿，这回可得买个全，你们好好看好啦！”他一面帮助那几个人挑选，一面自言自语：“没有这个集市，又得派人赶大车到镇上去买。”这个人原来是华家小队队长高占发，这天他领着生产组长、大车队长，一共买去了杈子、扫帚等十几种农具。在谈论起食堂集市时，他带着非常满意的口吻告诉我们：“以前社员买东西，来回得走二十里路，一趟就是大半天，成立服务站比以前方便了，但是商品样数不多，一个月还得跑两次集镇，自从有了定期的食堂集市，社员请假的少了，所以这两个月出勤率比过去增加20％。这还不算，社员们每次集市还可以向国家出售副业产品，过去卖些星星点点的东西不值得跑一趟，可现在不然了，多少不拘，既支援了国家建设，又增加了社员收入，真是一举两得。”
          照顾了急需
    社员们都称赞供销社替他们想的周到，天还没冷，糊窗纸送来了；正是腌菜的节骨眼，拉来了一大车海盐，而且在这天的集市上还摆出了黄烟、饼干、苏打等一些前几天见不到的品种。由于供销社工作做的细致，事前通过购销联络员和驻队员的调查，对谁家有什么特殊需要，他们早就做了准备。老社员钟振华的小孙子患了病，联络员和驻队员知道后，就通知了供销社，叫他们给捎些饼干和白糖来。这天的集市刚开始，钟老大娘就从营业员的手里接过一斤饼干和一包白糖。
    下午上工的时间到了，社员们一个个地离开了集市。营业员计算了一下，不到两小时，就收购了鸡蛋、药材、纤维、废品等三十多种，价值五百多元；供应了各种生产资料、生活资料一千一百多元，这等于过去在家四天的购销额。
