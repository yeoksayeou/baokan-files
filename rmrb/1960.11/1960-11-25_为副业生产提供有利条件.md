To improve sideline production this winter, Zhuangtou Commune in Weishi County, Henan Province, under the personal leadership of Liu Xingmin, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, established a sideline production committee. The committee set up a comprehensive office composed of finance, commerce, banking, transportation and other departments. Because the comprehensive office toured the production teams to help investigate raw materials for sideline production and solve technical and sales problems, sideline production developed rapidly. The Qiancao Production Team has a lot of cattails. If they are woven into grass bags, it can increase a lot of income. So the store immediately helped the production team send two commune members to Shangqiu City to learn weaving techniques, and after returning to the team, they taught other commune members. Grass bag production was quickly launched throughout the team. The cogon grass densely covering the barren hills around Zheng Guangda Production Team is a good raw material for making straw ropes. However, because they did not have good tools for harvesting, they could not harvest much each day. After the iron and wood factory discovered this problem, it quickly produced small wide-headed shovels specially for harvesting cogon grass, which increased the efficiency of grass cutting by more than two times compared with the original, and the amount of rope-making raw materials harvested every day increased a lot. The iron and wood factory also produced more than 310 jin of ammunition to meet the hunting needs of more than 20 production brigades.

    Our commune's sideline production has developed in this way. Now there are 15 production items that have already started: weaving, saltpeter boiling, braiding straw hat braids, etc. More than 70,000 straw ropes, 430 grass bags, and more than 8,700 earth baskets have been woven.

    为副业生产提供有利条件
    河南尉氏县庄头公社为了搞好今冬副业生产，在公社党委第一书记刘兴民的亲自领导下，成立了副业生产委员会。委员会下面设立了由财政、商业、银行、运输等部门组成的综合办公室。由于综合办公室巡回各生产队帮助调查副业生产原料和解决技术、销路等问题，因此使副业生产发展很快。前曹生产大队有很多蒲草，如果用它织成草袋，就能增加很多收入。于是商店立即帮助生产队派两个社员到商丘市学习编织技术，回队以后再教给别的社员，草袋生产很快就在全队开展起来。郑广大队四周的荒岗上密布的茅草是打草绳的好原料。但是因为他们没有好用的工具收割，所以每天收回的不多。铁木厂发现这个问题以后，就很快为它们生产出割茅草专用的宽头小铲，使割草工效比原来提高了二倍以上，每天收割的打绳原料增加很多。铁木工厂还生产出三百一十多斤枪弹，满足二十多个生产大队打猎的需要。
    我们公社的副业生产就这样开展起来了。现在已搞起的生产有：编织、熬硝、编草帽辫等十五项。已搓草绳七万多条，织草袋四百三十条，编土筐八千七百多个。
