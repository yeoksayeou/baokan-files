    Is it a treasure, or a bright pearl?
    Is it the full moon of the fifteenth,
    Or the newly rising sun?
    After reading Chairman Mao's works,
    My mind feels like a skylight has been opened,
    My will is like being cast into tons of pure steel.
    Spread those strong wings,
    Even if it's the cliffs of Mount Motian,
    Or the turbulent, boundless ocean,
    Don't even think of stopping the giant's footsteps,
    Because Mao Zedong Thought shines a brilliant golden light on us!
    			Hai Zhou, Worker, Inner Mongolia Printing Factory

    How can fish survive without water?
    How can grass live without soil?
    The moon relies on the sun to shine,
    The Chinese revolution shines red light because of Mao Zedong Thought!
    			Liu Jingli, Worker, Baoding Oil and Fat Chemical Factory

    Chairman Mao's works are a treasure,
    Infinite wisdom cannot be exhausted,
    Every chapter is the truth,
    Every word opens the mind,
    Close to the chest, the whole body is warm,
    Placed in the room, it shines with golden light.
    			Xu Zhuying, Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Liaoning

    Chairman Mao's works are a treasure chest,
    Strings of pearls sparkle with brilliance,
    Carefully polish, carefully chew,
    The ideological nutrition is priceless.
    Chairman Mao's works are an axe for opening mountains,
    Carried in the arms, strength is infinite,
    With a swing of the giant axe, mountains and rivers move,
    "Poor and blank" unfolds a grand plan.
    Chairman Mao's works are a compass,
    The sailing ship in the misty sea can see clearly,
    Facing a storm of twelve degrees,
    Chase the wind and waves towards the future.
    Chairman Mao's works are a demon-slaying sword,
    Even if fallacies are dressed in colorful clothes,
    With a wave of the sword, the painted skin falls off,
    Brightened the eyes and cleared the sky.
    Gold mountains, silver mountains, pearl mountains,
    Thousands upon thousands of treasures in the world,
    What treasure is the best?
    Chairman Mao's works are the treasure among treasures.
    			Cai Zhenxing, PLA Unit stationed in Qingdao

    The sun in the sky is red and glowing,
    Ten thousand flowers bloom beautifully,
    Commune members are beaming with joy,
    Studying theory reaches a peak.
    Chairman Mao's works open the mind,
    An eighty-year-old man becomes young again,
    The whole body suddenly grows the strength of Xiang Yu,
    Wielding an iron pickaxe, the big mountain shakes.
    Young people increase their energy after studying,
    Like a tiger with wings soaring into space,
    Carrying the water of the Five Lakes and Nine Rivers,
    Sprinkle it on the barren mountains to grow black gold.
    Women study even more enthusiastically,
    A leap forward fire burns in their chests,
    Working better than men,
    Vowing to seize high yields.
    Chairman Mao's works are true scriptures,
    Every word is like a pearl sprinkled in the countryside,
    Better than spring rain, better than oil,
    The mountain village is red with flowers overnight.
    Chairman Mao's works arrive in the countryside,
    Beating war drums to promote the leap forward,
    Songs of happiness are sung to the sky,
    The commune climbs another level.
    			Ren Guoyi, Weiyuan Commune, Longxi, Gansu

    幸福歌儿连天唱，
    公社更上天一重。
