　　Drawing Outstanding Cadres to Run Canteens

　　The Pingliang Special District of Gansu Province has transferred more than 2,000 outstanding cadres to go deep into rural public canteens as cooks and managers. Among these cadres, there are 193 leading cadres at the special district, county, and commune levels, and 2,228 general cadres, of which Communist Party members account for 59.4%, and Communist Youth League members account for 12%. The vast majority of these comrades are cadres with experience in rural work and possess excellent qualities such as selflessness, loyalty, and the ability to endure hardship.

　　Agricultural Advisory Network Shows its Value

　　The Party branch of the Hongxing Brigade of the Chengguan Commune in Meng County, Henan Province, fully utilizes the role of the agricultural advisory network in leading production work. This advisory network was established in the autumn of 1959, and its members are all poor and lower-middle peasants with rich production experience.

　　Over the past year, the main functions of the agricultural advisory network have been to rapidly implement the Party's guidelines and policies among the masses, to solve key problems in production in a timely manner, and to avoid subjectivism in the work of cadres.

　　Collecting Rice Roots as Pig Feed

　　Processed rice roots are a very good pig feed. The communes in the rice-producing areas of Songjiang, Jinshan, and Qingpu counties in the suburbs of Shanghai are mobilizing the broad masses of commune members to collect large quantities of rice roots during autumn plowing and autumn planting.

　　The majority of primary school students in Songjiang County are participating in picking up rice roots. Communes in Jinshan County organize auxiliary labor to pick up rice roots while turning the soil, picking as they turn, which saves effort and does not affect autumn planting.

　　Jiangsu Intensifies Cotton Picking

　　While rushing to finish autumn sowing, the people's communes in the cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu Province are arranging a certain amount of labor to seize sunny days and make the most of cloudy days to intensively pick cotton.

　　In order to ensure the quality of the late-stage cotton picking and achieve fine picking, all localities strictly follow cotton grades for separate picking and separate drying, separating good cotton from inferior cotton.

　　Shaanxi Re-collects and Re-picks Cotton

　　At the end of the cotton harvest season, the people's communes in the cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi Province are actively carrying out a re-inspection and re-picking campaign to bring this year's cotton harvesting work to a successful conclusion.

　　Tongchuan City mobilized a total of 35,000 laborers to re-inspect and re-pick the land section by section and plot by plot, trying to pick up as much seed cotton as possible that had fallen in the cotton fields and cotton husks.

　　In the re-collection and re-picking, all localities have adhered to the policy of work evaluation and scorekeeping, and more pay for more work. Some areas have also included careful collection and picking as part of the assessment of "Five-Good" commune members, which has promoted the development of the campaign.

　　Reserving Large Quantities of Dried and Pickled Vegetables

　　While harvesting autumn vegetables and planting winter vegetables well, public canteens in people's communes in various parts of Yunnan Province are seizing the favorable opportunity of the current large harvest of autumn vegetables to vigorously reserve dried vegetables for the slack season of vegetables next spring. At present, more than 100,000 public canteens across the province have reserved 67.8 million catties of various dried and pickled vegetables.

　　Grain, Vegetables, and Straw Arranged and Implemented Together

　　The Taoyuan production team of the Linze Commune in Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, while handing over and selling the state-procured grain, arranged and implemented the rations, vegetables, and straw for the commune members. Everyone knows what they have, and every family has a foundation for their lives.

　　Grain arrangements are made with long-term plans and short-term arrangements, with rations determined by the number of people, and planned grain consumption. For vegetables, consumption and production are combined and uniformly arranged. In order to arrange the straw well, the commune members make reasonable allocations based on the principle of comprehensive consideration and careful calculation of production, life, and feed.

　　Formulating Sweet Potato Cellar Management Archives

　　The Laodian People's Commune in Huaxian County, Henan Province, implements a sweet potato cellar management archive system. Out of the commune's 505 sweet potato cellars, 452 cellars have been documented separately for potato seedlings, potato seeds, and table potatoes. The recorded items are mainly divided into: variety, cellar number, time of entry into the cellar, quantity, cellar temperature, inspection time, changes in the cellar, technical management measures, etc.
