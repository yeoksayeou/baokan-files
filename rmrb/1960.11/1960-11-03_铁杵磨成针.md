Iron Pestle Ground into a Needle

　　We have all heard the story of "grinding an iron pestle into a needle," but it is just a fable.

　　When the Chinese People's Volunteers were in Korea, following the strategic policy of protracted warfare and active defense proposed by Chairman Mao, they launched a movement to build underground Great Walls with soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom. The volunteer soldiers used these simple tools, day and night, to fight against the stubborn rocks underground. The tunnel fortifications were lengthened day by day, and the tools were shortened day by day. Please look at the sharp contrast in this photo. The original sixty-centimeter-long cross pickaxe has been ground into a small thing the size of a thumb, and the original thirty-centimeter-long and twenty-centimeter-wide iron shovel is almost gone. From the degree of wear of these tools, we can imagine how arduous labor the volunteer heroes have put in. They have a determination more stubborn than stone and a will harder than steel. Isn't this the hero who is grinding the iron pestle into a needle today? Now the volunteers have long been withdrawn to the motherland, and these tools have also been sent to the museum for display, but this heroic spirit of grinding the iron pestle into a needle is worth learning forever.

    铁杵磨成针
    我们都听说过“铁杵磨成针”的故事，但那只不过是一个寓言。
    中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的时候，遵照毛主席提出的持久作战积极防御的战略方针，曾以冲天的干劲和无穷的智慧掀起一个修筑地下长城运动。志愿军战士就是用这些简单的工具，夜以继日地在地下与顽石搏斗。坑道工事一天天在延长，工具一天天在缩短，请看这照片上鲜明的对比，原长六十厘米的十字镐，被磨成拇指长的小东西了，原长三十厘米、宽二十厘米的铁锹，磨得都快没有了。从这些工具磨损程度上来看，我们可以想像出，志愿军英雄们付出了多么艰巨的劳动。他们有比石头还顽强的决心，比钢铁还坚硬的意志，这不正是今朝的铁杵磨成针的英雄吗？如今志愿军早已撤回祖国，这些工具也送到博物馆陈列起来，而这种铁杵磨成针的英雄精神却值得我们永远学习。
