(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 6th dispatch) The county and commune industries of Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, are fully utilizing the manpower and materials supported by urban industries, adapting to local conditions, and using both indigenous and foreign methods to reform equipment and agricultural machinery, thereby accelerating agricultural technological transformation.

This year, Wuxi County's county and commune industries have received strong support from Wuxi City's industrial departments and others. The county's forty communes have added more than seven hundred pieces of machinery and equipment. In order to gradually base the technological transformation of agriculture on self-reliance, the county and commune factories of Wuxi County have been vigorously engaged in technical innovation and technical revolution. On the one hand, they have reformed existing machinery and equipment to increase production capacity, and on the other hand, they have built various types of indigenous machinery to replace manual labor and improve the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of production. The forty-five agricultural machinery factories, which bear the main task of agricultural technological transformation, have become weak links in production, with casting, forging, and wooden parts processes relying on manual operation after having machine equipment such as lathes, planers, pliers, and punches with the support of urban industries. The workers of the agricultural machinery factories in each commune relied on the equipment and technical strength supported by the city to carry out technical innovation vigorously to change this situation. The workers of the Luoshe Agricultural Machinery Factory, with the help of workers sent to the countryside by the Wuxi Forging and Welding Factory, successfully manufactured a spring hammer for forging in only five days, eliminating the need for sledgehammers in ironworking. In half a month, this experience was widely promoted throughout the county. Promoted by the support of all sectors of the city, the county's forty-five factories have realized more than seven hundred innovation projects in half a year, manufactured three hundred pieces of indigenous equipment, greatly improving the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of production, and released more than five hundred and eighty laborers to strengthen the agricultural front line.

The county and commune factories of Wuxi County also rely on veteran workers and technicians from the city who are sent to the countryside to accelerate the training of technical forces through short-term intensive training and organizing master-apprentice teaching and learning methods. In half a year, the county's forty-five agricultural machinery factories have trained more than one thousand nine hundred people who are both workers and farmers, who can use, repair, and manufacture a variety of farm tools.

Now, the agricultural machinery factories in each commune in the county have established processes from casting and forging to processing and assembly, and have complete sets of machine equipment that combine indigenous and foreign methods. They not only achieve small and medium repairs without leaving the commune, but also produce improved farm tools, semi-mechanized farm tools, and many types of medium and small agricultural machinery suitable for local production characteristics in batches. For example, this county is a rice-wheat rotation area, and the rural areas are all small paddy fields, so general tractors are not suitable. Therefore, a dozen or so communes near the city with electricity have manufactured a batch of electric rope traction machines; communes far from the city and lacking electricity have manufactured mechanical rope traction machines. These two types of traction machines are not only suitable for the needs of both wet and dry seasons, but also have a simple structure, are easy to manufacture, and are easy to promote. The vigorous technical innovation of county and commune industries and the growth of the technical forces of workers and farmers also promote the vigorous development of the farm tool reform movement in rural areas. More than 30,000 pieces of improved tools have been created and promoted throughout the county.

    利用城市支援的设备发展生产能力
    利用城市下乡的工人提高技术水平
    无锡县社工业迅速成长更好地为农业生产服务
    本报南京6日电　江苏省无锡县的县社工业充分利用城市工业支援的人力、物力，因地制宜、土洋并举地进行设备改革和农业机械的改革，加速农业技术改造。
    无锡县县社工业今年得到了无锡市工业等部门的大力支援。全县四十个公社就增添了七百多台机器设备。为了把对农业的技术改造逐步建立在自力更生的基础上，无锡县各县社工厂大闹技术革新和技术革命，一方面改革原有机器设备，提高生产能力，一方面大造各种土机器用来代替手工操作，提高生产的机械化、半机械化程度。担负着农业技术改造主要任务的四十五家农业机械厂，在城市工业支援下，有了车、刨、钳、冲等机器设备以后，那些靠手工操作的铸造、锻压及木制配件等工序就成了生产上的薄弱环节。各公社农机厂的工人们就依靠城市支援的设备和技术力量，大搞技术革新，来改变这种状况。洛社农机厂的工人，在无锡锻焊厂下乡工人的帮助下，仅用五天时间，就制造成功了一台锻压用的弹簧锤，使打铁丢掉了鎯头。半个月，这一经验就在全县普遍推广。在城市各行各业支援的促进下，全县四十五家工厂在半年时间内，就实现了七百多项革新项目，制造了三百台土设备，使生产的机械化半机械化程度大大提高，并抽出了五百八十多个劳动力，加强了农业第一线。
    无锡县各县社工厂还依靠城市下乡的老工人和技术人员，通过短期集中训练、组织师徒包教包学等方法，加速培养技术力量。全县四十五个农机厂在半年时间内，就培养了一千九百多名亦工亦农、会用会修、能够制造多种农具的人材。
    现在，这个县各个公社的农机厂都建立了从铸造、锻压到加工、装备等工序，并有了土洋结合的成套的机具设备，不仅做到了中小修不出社，还成批地生产了适合本地生产特点的改良农具、半机械化农具和许多种中小型农业机械。例如，这个县是稻麦轮作区，农村都是地块较小的水田，一般拖拉机不适用。因此，靠城市较近的有电源的十几个公社，就制造了一批电力绳索牵引机；离城较远、缺乏电源的公社，则制造了机械绳索牵引机。这两种牵引机不仅适合水旱两季的需要，而且结构简单，制造方便，易于推广。县社工业大闹技术革新和亦工亦农的技术力量的成长，也促使农村中的农具改革运动蓬勃发展。全县创制和推广的改良工具已有三万多件。
