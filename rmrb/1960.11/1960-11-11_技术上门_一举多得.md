Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the leadership of local Party committees, science and technology associations in many places have organized scientific and technical personnel, teachers and students from relevant scientific research institutions, universities, and related production units, as well as production experts and other scientific and technical forces. This has created a more closely coordinated, more proactive, and more effective way to serve production: "Technology Door-to-Door." "Technology Door-to-Door" is a product of the mass movement of all people engaging in science and technology and the technological revolution. The content of "Technology Door-to-Door" activities is rich and varied. Some places mainly use it to summarize advanced technologies, advanced experiences, and promote new technologies and new experiences; some places mainly use it to solve technical bottlenecks in production; and some places mainly use this activity to popularize scientific and technological knowledge. Many places comprehensively leverage the above aspects when carrying out this activity. These activities have various names in different places. People often call the summarization of advanced technologies and advanced experiences "investigation teams," "survey teams," "general survey teams," etc.; the promotion of new technologies and new experiences is called "advanced technology promotion teams," "promotion teams," "service teams," "lecture teams," etc.; and the resolution of technical bottlenecks in production is called "technical consultations," "medical teams," "attack teams," "youth shock brigades," and so on. The scale of these activities also varies, from small groups of a few people in a single discipline to large-scale joint organizations of hundreds or thousands of people from many professional fields. The greatest feature of this "Technology Door-to-Door" activity is that it meets the requirements of developing science and technology and building socialism in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical. Its advantages are: clear goals, specific tasks, concentrated forces, flexible methods, rapid action, obvious results, and it is very much in line with the principle of economic thrift. Because this activity does not require investment in capital construction, nor does it require additional staffing, as long as there is correct leadership and the relevant parties are well organized, it can play a huge role.

Various "Technology Door-to-Door" activities have effectively strengthened scientific and technological work on the front lines of industrial and agricultural production, demonstrating great superiority. It can not only promptly popularize scientific and technological knowledge, summarize and promote advanced technologies and advanced experiences, but also solve major production technology problems that the scientific and technological forces of a region, a unit, or an aspect could not solve in the past, promoting the sustained leap forward in production. At the same time, through these activities, scientific and technical personnel and school teachers and students go deep into production and among the masses, making theory closely linked to practice, further enriching and supplementing the content of scientific research and teaching, promoting the ideological remolding of intellectuals, and deepening the mass movement of technological revolution. This is truly a good thing that accomplishes many things, so it is increasingly welcomed by the broad masses. "Technology Door-to-Door" activities are relatively common in provinces and cities such as Hubei, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, and Guangdong. In May of this year, Hubei Province organized a scientific and technological service group of more than 1,000 people from seven scientific and technological research units and twelve universities and secondary specialized schools in the Wuhan area to conduct activities in thirty-five rural people's communes and sixty factories and construction sites in thirteen counties. They assisted grassroots industrial and agricultural units in solving 207 urgent key problems, promoted the application of 17 new technologies, carried out 231 installations, modifications, and construction project designs, and summarized 121 advanced technologies and advanced experiences. This played a good role in promoting the implementation of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's call for "four fasts in wheat harvesting" in agriculture and "seizing high yield, high quality, and low cost" in industry at that time. For example, the technical service group repaired ten harvesters and threshers for the Lutou Commune, which increased the daily harvest from 1.5 million jin to 3 million jin. In industry, they found the rules for rational charging, temperature control, and cooling time in the sulfur sublimation production process, which increased the daily output from 350 kilograms to 3,250 kilograms, increasing production capacity by more than eight times, while reducing fuel consumption by 90%. Scientific and technical personnel and teachers and students who participated in this activity also conducted sixteen relatively major scientific research projects, compiled many valuable lecture notes, and collected many specimens. Because "Technology Door-to-Door" activities have so many benefits for production, scientific research, and teaching, the supported production units welcome it, praising it as timely help, and the units participating in this activity also welcome it, saying it is a lively school that promotes scientific research and teaching.

However, at present, this "Technology Door-to-Door" activity is not widespread enough. In order to adapt to the sustained leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, especially the current requirements for vigorously developing agriculture and grain production, to give full play to the role of science and technology in supporting agriculture, and to send science and technology to the front line of production more universally and better, it is necessary to universally promote the successful experience of "Technology Door-to-Door" in serving production throughout the country, and to continuously consolidate and improve it. Places that have done well in the past should continue to work hard and develop in a broader, deeper, and more comprehensive direction. In places where it has been carried out but not well, further strengthen the work and catch up with advanced areas. In places where this work has not yet been carried out, seize the opportunity and act quickly. To achieve this requirement, according to past experience, first of all, the leaders and masses of relevant scientific and technological departments and relevant institutions of higher learning must further strengthen their understanding of "Technology Door-to-Door" activities, attach great importance to this activity, and try every means to overcome the difficulties encountered in the process of carrying out this aspect of activities. It should be recognized that the process of carrying out "Technology Door-to-Door" activities is a process of implementing the Party's policy of science and technology serving production, constantly overcoming the bourgeois ideology of science for science's sake, a process of implementing the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and also a process of ideological remolding of scientific and technical personnel and intellectuals.

Specific arrangements should be made in a planned and appropriate manner to ensure the smooth progress of "Technology Door-to-Door" activities. According to the actual needs of industrial and agricultural production in various places and the specific conditions of local science and technology, how many "Technology Door-to-Door" activities should be organized in a year, half a year, or a quarter, especially in this winter? What are the main contents of each activity? What is the scale? How long does it take? Which relevant departments participate? The organizations of the Science and Technology Association at all levels should assist the Party committee in making specific plans. In places where there is already a foundation for this activity, efforts should also be made to continuously improve it when formulating plans, so that this activity is gradually institutionalized, regularized, and systematized.

In various "Technology Door-to-Door" activities, the forces sent down from above must be combined with the technical personnel, worker-peasant innovators of grassroots production units, and the scientific and technological forces of local scientific research organizations. Because the grassroots scientific and technological force is the backbone force in the mass movement of technological revolution and the mass base of "Technology Door-to-Door" activities, the good combination of the forces from above and them can solve the problems in production well, and can also continuously cultivate and strengthen the grassroots scientific and technological team, improve their theoretical level, and enable science and technology to continuously leap forward in the mass production practice of grassroots production units; this is also an important condition for promoting the continuous leap forward in production.

"Technology Door-to-Door" is still a new thing with little past experience, so it should be enthusiastically supported. To ensure that this activity is carried out better, Party committees at all levels in various places need to strengthen their leadership over this work, strengthen ideological and political work for scientific and technical personnel, and promptly summarize and promote the experiences of advanced areas, so that this activity can not only be quickly and universally unfolded in various places, but also continuously advance on the basis of the achievements already made, create more perfect forms, and make greater contributions in supporting production.

    “技术上门”一举多得
    自1958年大跃进以来，有不少地方的科学技术协会在当地党委的领导下，组织有关科学研究机关、高等学校以及有关生产单位的科学技术人员、师生和生产能手等各方面的科学技术力量，创造了一种更密切协作、更积极主动、更有效地为生产服务的活动方式——“技术上门”。“技术上门”是全民办科学和技术革命的群众运动发展的产物。“技术上门”活动的内容是丰富多采的，有的地方主要通过它来总结先进技术、先进经验和推广新技术新经验；有的地方主要通过它去解决生产上的技术关键；也有的地方主要通过这种活动去普及科学技术知识。很多地方在开展这一活动时，同时综合地发挥了以上各方面的作用。对于这种活动，各地有各种不同的名称，人们常把总结先进技术、先进经验的叫做“考察团”、“调查团”、“普查队”等，把推广新技术、新经验的叫做“先进技术推广队”、“促进团”、“服务队”、“讲师团”等，而把解决生产上技术关键的就叫做“技术会诊”、“医疗队”、“攻坚队”、“青年突击队”等等。这种活动的规模也是大小不等的，从一个学科的单一兵种的几人小组，直到由许多专业的多兵种大联合的几百上千人的组织。这种“技术上门”的活动方式，最大特色是合乎多、快、好、省地发展科学技术、建设社会主义的要求。它的好处是：目标明确，任务具体，力量集中，方式灵活，行动迅速，效果明显，而且很合乎经济节约的原则。因为在这种活动中不需要基本建设的投资，也不需要另外增加人员编制，只要有正确的领导，把有关方面很好地组织起来就可以发挥巨大的作用。
    各种“技术上门”的活动，有效地加强了工农业生产第一线的科学技术工作，显示了巨大的优越性。它不但能及时普及科学技术知识，总结和推广先进技术和先进经验，而且能够解决过去一个地区、一个单位、一个方面的科学技术力量一时所不能解决的生产技术上的重大问题，促进生产的持续跃进。同时，通过这些活动，使科学技术人员和学校师生深入生产、深入群众，使理论密切联系实际，更丰富了和充实了科学研究和教学的内容，促进了知识分子的思想改造，并使技术革命的群众运动深入发展。这真是一举多得的好事，所以日益受到广大群众的欢迎。“技术上门”的活动，在湖北、河北、江苏、上海、黑龙江、陕西、广东等省市都比较普遍。湖北省在今年5月组织武汉地区七个科学技术研究单位和十二所大专院校和中等专科学校，共有一千多人的科学技术服务团，深入十三个县三十五个农村人民公社和六十个工厂、工地进行活动，协助工农业基层单位解决了亟待解决的关键问题二百零七个，推广应用了新技术十七项，进行各种设备的安装、改装和建设工程的设计二百三十一项，总结各种先进技术、先进经验一百二十一项，这就为贯彻当时湖北省委在农业方面提出的“麦收四快”、在工业方面提出的“夺取高产、优质、低成本”的号召，起了良好的促进作用。如技术服务团为鹿头公社修复了十台收割机和脱粒机，就使过去每天收打一百五十万斤一跃而为三百万斤。而他们在工业方面找到了硫升华生产过程中的合理上料、掌握温度和冷却时间的规律，使日产量一下就由三百五十公斤跃为三千二百五十公斤，生产能力提高了八倍多，而燃料耗用则降低了90％。参加这一活动的科学技术人员和师生，在活动中也结合进行了比较重大的十六项科学研究，编写了很多有价值的讲义，搜集了很多标本。正因为“技术上门”的活动对生产、对科学研究和教学工作有这么多的好处，被支援的生产单位欢迎它，称誉它是雪中送炭，参加这一活动的单位也欢迎它，说它是推动科学研究和教学工作的生动活泼的学校。
    但是在目前，这种“技术上门”的活动还开展得不够普遍。为了适应工农业生产持续跃进，特别是当前大办农业、大办粮食的要求，要充分发挥科学技术支援农业的作用，把科学技术更普遍地更好地送上生产第一线去，必须把“技术上门”这一为生产服务的成功经验，在全国范围内普遍推广，并使之不断巩固和不断提高。过去开展得较好的地方，要继续努力，向更广泛、更深入、更全面的方向发展。在已开展但开展得不好的地方，要进一步加强工作，赶上先进地区。在尚未开展这一工作的地方，要抓紧时机，迅速行动起来。要达到这一要求，根据过去的经验，首先必须有关科学技术部门以及有关高等院校的领导和群众进一步加强对“技术上门”活动的认识，要十分重视这一活动，并千方百计地想办法克服在开展这方面活动过程中所遇到的困难。应当认识，开展“技术上门”活动的过程，是贯彻党的科学技术为生产服务的方针、不断克服为科学而科学的资产阶级思想的过程，是贯彻教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的过程，也是科学技术人员和知识分子进行思想改造的过程。
    应该有计划地妥善地进行具体安排，才能保证“技术上门”的活动顺利开展。根据各地工农业生产的实际需要，以及当地科学技术的具体条件，在一年、半年或一季当中，特别是在今年冬季当中，要组织多少次“技术上门”的活动？每次活动的主要内容是什么？规模有多大？时间多长？哪些有关部门参加？科学技术协会的各级组织都应该协助党委作出具体计划。而在对这一活动已经有基础的地方，在制订计划时，还要尽量设法使其不断提高，使这种活动逐步制度化、经常化和系统化。
    在各种“技术上门”的活动中，上面派下去的力量，必须与基层生产单位的技术人员、工农革新家以及当地的科学研究组织的科学技术力量结合起来。因为基层科学技术力量是技术革命的群众运动中的骨干力量，是“技术上门”活动的群众基础，上面的力量和他们结合得好，才能很好地解决生产中的问题，也才能不断培养壮大基层科学技术队伍，提高他们的理论水平，使科学技术在基层生产单位的群众生产实践中，获得不断跃进；这也是促进生产不断跃进的一个重要条件。
    “技术上门”还是一个新生事物，过去的经验还少，要热情地扶植它。保证更好地开展这一活动，还需要各地各级党委加强对这一工作的领导，对科学技术人员加强思想政治工作，及时总结和推广先进地区的经验，使这种活动不但能够迅速地在各地普遍展开，而且，能够在已取得成绩的基础上，不断前进，创造出更完善的形式，在支援生产方面作出更大的贡献。
