Nanchang Dispatch from Our Newspaper, October 31st: Jiangxi Province is planting winter green manure crops on a large scale, striving to ensure that there is basically one mu of green manure for every mu of early rice field in the province, as an important measure to guarantee high yields of early rice next year. Currently, the province-wide campaign to plant green manure on a large scale has fully formed a high tide. The characteristics of this year's large-scale green manure planting are: old areas that plant green manure are planting more, areas that plant less or do not plant green manure are also expanding planting significantly; plains areas are planting more, and hilly and mountainous areas are also expanding planting significantly; planting in good fields, and also expanding planting significantly in low-yield fields. By the 24th, a total of 1.05 million mu of green manure had been rushed into planting in various places.

Red clover and other green manure crops are winter-planted and spring-tilled, and are high-yield fertilizers suitable for planting in the south, containing the three major elements of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as rich organic matter. In order to adapt to the need for increased grain production, especially increased early rice production which accounts for more than half of the annual grain output, Jiangxi Province has vigorously expanded the planting of winter green manure crops in recent years. In 1959, the province's winter-sown green manure area reached more than 19 million mu. Calculated according to the early rice planting area, an average of 1.3 mu of land had one mu of green manure, an increase of nearly four times compared with the early days of liberation in 1949; the yield per unit area also increased from an average of about 1,000 jin in 1949 to more than 3,000 jin. The large-scale development of green manure has played a powerful role in solving the problem of early rice base fertilizer in the following year, improving the soil, and ensuring high yields of early rice.

According to the requirements of running agriculture on a large scale and running grain production on a large scale, Jiangxi Province will further expand the area of early rice next year. In order to achieve high yields of early rice next year, more and sufficient base fertilizer is needed. To this end, based on the spirit of grasping grain production with one hand and grasping fertilizer production with the other, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee called on the province to seize the winter planting of green manure with the same energy as grasping grain production, to continue to plant green manure on a large scale, requiring the green manure area to continue to expand on the basis of 19 million mu last year, to achieve one mu of green manure for every mu of early rice field, and at the same time to plant well and manage well to achieve high yields.

In order to expand the green manure area, the province has determined to grasp three types of regions together. First, old areas where green manure planting is already very common should still try every means to strive to plant more; second, in areas where green manure planting is less common or in new areas that do not yet have the habit of planting green manure, the area should be greatly expanded; third, in areas with many low-yield areas and low-yield fields, efforts should be made to plant all low-yield fields with green manure, so as to combine the development of green manure with the transformation of low-yield fields. At present, the broad masses of cadres and people in all regions are rapidly launching a campaign to expand and rush to plant green manure under the slogan of "using fertilizer to protect grain and using fertilizer to promote grain." Shangrao and Yichun prefectures are the regions where green manure was originally planted the most, and the area of winter green manure planting this year has been further expanded compared with last year. Leping and Pingxiang counties, key green manure producing areas, while maintaining the area of green manure planted on cultivated land last year, have also universally launched the green manure "moving" and "going up the mountain" campaigns. New areas where less green manure was originally planted and green manure was developed, put forward the slogan of green manure "catching up with the old areas and surpassing the old areas," grasping ideology, grasping measures, and trying every means to make full use of winter idle fields to strive to rush planting.

Most of the low-yield areas and low-yield fields in Jiangxi Province are red soil fields and cold paddy fields, and the soil lacks organic matter. Planting organic matter-rich green manure is an effective measure to transform low-yield fields. Therefore, this year, various localities have paid special attention to expanding green manure planting in low-yield areas and low-yield fields. Dongxiang County, a red soil area, used the fact that it has planted green manure on a large scale in recent years, improved the soil, and transformed low-yield fields into high-yield fields to educate the masses, mobilize the masses to advance victoriously, and plant all the remaining low-yield fields with green manure this year.

In order to strive for high yields of green manure, various localities have focused on planting quality and field management from the beginning of sowing. In the new green manure planting areas throughout the province, training classes on green manure cultivation techniques have been generally held before sowing, and sowing techniques have been taught to the broad masses through the trained farmer technicians. In sowing, various localities have promoted a series of measures such as uniform and fine sowing, rational close planting, and early ditching to prevent waterlogging. At the same time, in response to the past habit of "only planting fertilizer, not raising fertilizer," the masses were organized to apply base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer on a large scale, strengthen field management, so as to make green manure planted in a variety of ways, planted well, and managed well.

### 以肥保粮  肥足粮丰  江西为明年早稻高产大种越冬绿肥

    以肥保粮  肥足粮丰
    江西为明年早稻高产大种越冬绿肥
    本报南昌31日电　江西省大种越冬绿肥作物，力争全省一亩早稻田基本有一亩绿肥，作为保证明年早稻多种高产的重要措施。目前全省大种绿肥运动已全面形成高潮。今年大种绿肥的特点是：种绿肥的老区多种，种绿肥较少和不种绿肥的地区也大量扩种；平原地区多种，丘陵山区也大量扩种；在好田里种，在低产田里也大量扩种。到24日，各地共抢种绿肥一百零五万亩。
    红花草等绿肥作物冬种春翻，是适宜南方种植的含有氮、磷、钾三大要素和丰富有机质的高产肥料。江西省为适应粮食增产、特别是占全年粮食产量一半以上的早稻增产的需要，几年来大力扩种冬种绿肥作物。1959年全省冬播绿肥面积已达一千九百多万亩，按早稻播种面积计算，平均一点三亩田就有一亩绿肥，比解放初期1949年增加将近四倍；单位面积产量也由1949年的平均一千斤左右增加到了三千斤以上。绿肥大发展，对解决次年早稻基肥、改良土壤，保证早稻多种高产起了有力作用。
    根据大办农业、大办粮食的要求，江西省明年早稻面积将进一步扩大。为了明年早稻多种高产，需要更多更足的基肥。为此，江西省委根据一手抓粮、一手抓肥的精神，号召全省今年以抓粮食的劲头抓冬种绿肥，继续大种特种绿肥，要求绿肥面积在去年一千九百万亩的基础上再继续扩大，达到一亩早稻田基本有一亩绿肥，同时要种好、管好，实现高产。
    为扩大绿肥面积，全省确定分别三类地区一齐抓。一是原来种绿肥已很普遍的老区，仍要千方百计力争多种；二是在原来种植绿肥较少的地区或还没有种绿肥习惯的新区，要大力扩种；三是低产地区和低产田多的地区，要争取低产田全部种上绿肥，使发展绿肥和改造低产田结合起来。目前所有地区的广大干部和群众在“以肥保粮，以肥促粮”的口号下，扩种抢种绿肥的运动正在迅速展开。上饶、宜春两个专区是原来种植绿肥最多的地区，今年冬种绿肥面积都比去年进一步扩大。绿肥重点产区乐平、萍乡等县，在保持去年在耕地上种植绿肥的面积的同时，又普遍开展了绿肥“搬家”“上山”运动。原来种植绿肥较少和发展绿肥的新区，提出绿肥“赶老区、超老区”的口号，抓思想、抓措施，千方百计利用冬闲田奋力抢种。
    江西省低产区、低产田多系红壤地、冷浆田，土壤缺乏有机质，种植有机质丰富的绿肥是改造低产田的一项有效措施。因此，今年各地特别注意在低产区和低产田扩种绿肥。红壤地区的东乡县，运用几年来大种绿肥，改良土壤，低产变高产的事实教育群众，发动群众乘胜前进，把今年尚有的低产田全部种上了绿肥。
    为了争取绿肥高产，各地从播种开始就狠抓播种质量和田间管理。全省新扩种绿肥地区，播种前普遍举办了绿肥栽培技术训练班，并通过训练的农民技术员向广大群众传授播种技术。在播种中，各地推行了匀播细播、合理密植和提早开沟防渍等一系列措施。同时针对过去“只种肥，不养肥”的习惯，组织群众大施基肥、追肥，加强田间管理，从而使绿肥作到多种、种好、管好。（附图片）
