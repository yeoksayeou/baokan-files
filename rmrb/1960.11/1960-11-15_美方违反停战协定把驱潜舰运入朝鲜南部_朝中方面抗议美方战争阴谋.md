Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 14th: According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) from Kaesong: The Korean Military Armistice Commission held its 130th meeting today, based on the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese side. At the meeting, the Korean and Chinese side lodged a strong protest with the U.S. side regarding the U.S.'s another serious violation of Article 13, Paragraph D, of the Armistice Agreement by transferring U.S. ASW ships to the South Korean puppet navy.

The Chief Member of the Korean and Chinese side, Major General Zhu Changjun, said at the meeting that the U.S. side not only fails to withdraw all foreign troops headed by the U.S. military from South Korea at an early date, but also continues to transport combat equipment into South Korea, plotting to re-ignite the war. Major General Zhu Changjun condemned this action by the U.S. side, saying that it not only seriously violates the Armistice Agreement, but also is a vicious challenge to peace in Korea and the Far East. Major General Zhu Changjun strongly demanded that the U.S. side immediately cease the criminal act of transporting ASW ships into South Korea, and at the same time demanded that all atomic and missile weapons, as well as other new types of weapons, ships and combat aircraft illegally transported into South Korea be immediately removed from South Korea.

    美方违反停战协定把驱潜舰运入朝鲜南部
    朝中方面抗议美方战争阴谋
    新华社平壤14日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：朝鲜军事停战委员会根据朝中方面的建议，今天举行了第一百三十次会议。朝中方面在会上就美方又一次严重违反停战协定第十三款卯项、把美国驱潜舰移交给南朝鲜傀儡海军一事向美方提出了强硬抗议。
    朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在会上说，美方不仅不从朝鲜南部早日撤出以美军为首的一切外国军队，而且继续往朝鲜南部运入作战装备，阴谋重新挑起战争。朱昌骏少将谴责美方的这一行动说，这不仅严重地违反停战协定，而且是对朝鲜和远东和平的恶毒的挑战。朱昌骏少将强烈要求美方立即停止把驱潜舰运入朝鲜南部的犯罪行动，同时要求把非法运入朝鲜南部的原子、导弹武器以及其他各种新式武器、船只和作战飞机全部立即从朝鲜南部搬出去。
