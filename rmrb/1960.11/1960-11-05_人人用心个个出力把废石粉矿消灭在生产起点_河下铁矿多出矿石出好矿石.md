Hexia Iron Mine Produces More Ore and Better Ore
(Our newspaper Nanchang, 4th dispatch) The workers of Jiangxi Province's Hexia Iron Mine, in order to guarantee steel production with high yield and quality, are vigorously improving the quality of ore, and have launched a high tide of producing more ore, better ore, and lump ore, minimizing waste stone and powder ore in the ore. Now, the entire mine not only ensures that the blast furnaces are "full" in quantity, but also ensures that the blast furnaces are "eating" better in quality. The ore dilution rate has been reduced to below 10%, and the powder ore rate has also been significantly reduced, making the grade of commercial ore as high as 52% or more.

Hexia Iron Mine undertakes the task of supplying ore to four or five key iron and steel enterprises in Jiangxi Province. Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement, the iron and steel front has further implemented the policy of "fine materials, high wind, and high temperature", urgently requiring high-quality ore. Under this situation, Hexia Iron Mine workers have proposed: to take the high standards of smelting fine materials of various iron and steel enterprises as the criterion, further improve the quality of ore, and fully support the iron and steel front with high yield and quality. The mine's Party committee supported the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers and also calculated an account for all the workers: According to the original 20% waste stone and 40% powder ore per ton of ore, two to two and a half tons of ore are needed to smelt one ton of pig iron. If the waste stone and powder ore are reduced by half, half a ton to one ton less ore can be used to smelt one ton of iron, and a part of the labor force for mineral processing and powder ore sintering in steel plants can be reduced, and the smelting cost can also be greatly reduced. All the workers realized that grasping high ore quality is a powerful action to support steel production. Based on this, the mine's Party committee issued the call to "produce more ore, better ore, and lump ore", requiring "waste stone and powder ore not to go down the mountain". All the workers then launched a high tide of increasing production of high-quality ore.

In order to eliminate waste stone and powder ore at the starting point of production, mining workers have carried out a series of improvements to the methods of drilling holes, loading explosives, blasting, stripping, and even mining, depending on the different situations of open-pit mining, stope mining, ore seam thickness, and rock firmness. Wind drill workers and blasting workers pay attention to reducing the impact force when drilling holes and carefully avoid crushing when loading explosives to prevent mixing in waste stone. In the remaining edge part of open-pit mining, they take the method of first breaking the top plate to clean up the floating soil and then mining. After stripping, they carefully clean up the floating soil and waste stone. Workers in Pi Zuchun's mining team also added a layer of obstacles such as branches on the remaining edge part, so that many ores would not be blasted to the mountain rocks and crushed during blasting. Stope mining workers have also promoted the experience of the old worker Xu Changcai of drilling a hole at one time and blasting in stages, according to the characteristics of thin ore seams in the stope, close distance between the top and bottom plates, and easy mixing of waste stone, and many difficulties have been overcome by them.

The ore produced by the four large mining areas of Hexia Iron Mine must be uniformly transported down the mountain through a mineral transport area, which is an important checkpoint to further ensure the quality of the ore. All the workers in the mineral transport area took the initiative to cooperate closely with the mining workers, comprehensively adjusted the transportation routes, innovated the chute tools, and loaded and unloaded lightly, basically avoiding the phenomenon of ore colliding with each other and turning into powder ore during transportation. For the waste stone that the mining area cannot completely remove, the mineral transport workers also took many measures to remove it during transportation, making the transportation process a mineral processing process, thereby greatly improving the grade of ore for outward transportation.

The workers of Hexia Iron Mine also strengthened the quality inspection and gate-keeping system meticulously. From leading cadres, technicians to the broad masses of workers, and professional quality inspection teams closely cooperated, everyone is an inspector, and everyone is a mineral processing expert. Caring about the quality of ore anytime and anywhere has become the atmosphere of the entire mine. Mutual evaluation and supervision systems have also been implemented between shifts, between mining areas, and between the previous and next processes. (Picture attached)

    人人用心个个出力把废石粉矿消灭在生产起点
    河下铁矿多出矿石出好矿石
    本报南昌4日电　江西省河下铁矿职工，为保证钢铁，高产优质，大力提高矿石质量，掀起了多出矿、出好矿、出块矿的热潮，尽量把矿石中的废石、粉矿减少到最低限度。现在，全矿不仅在数量上保证了高炉吃饱，而且在质量上做到了让高炉吃得更好。矿石贫化率降低到10％以下，粉矿率也有大幅度下降，使商品矿石品位高达52％以上。
    河下铁矿担负着江西省四五个重点钢铁企业的矿石供应任务。开展增产节约运动以来，钢铁战线进一步贯彻执行了精料、大风、高温的方针，迫切需要优质矿石。在这一形势下，河下铁矿职工纷纷提出：要以各钢铁企业冶炼精料的高标准为准则，进一步提高矿石质量，全力支援钢铁战线高产优质。矿党委支持了广大职工群众的热情，并且向全体职工算了一笔账：按照原来每吨矿石含20％的废石、40％的粉矿，需要两吨到两吨半矿石才能炼出一吨生铁。如果把废石、粉矿减少一半，就可以少用半吨到一吨矿石炼出一吨铁，还可减少钢铁厂一部分选矿和粉矿烧结的劳动力，冶炼成本也可大幅度下降。全体职工认识到，狠抓矿石优质，是支援钢铁生产的一个有力行动。在此基础上，矿党委发出了“多出矿、出好矿、出块矿”的号召，要求做到“废石、粉矿不下山”。全体职工随即掀起了增产优质矿石的热潮。
    为了把废石、粉矿消灭在生产的起点，采矿工人分别露采、窿采、矿层厚薄、岩质坚松等等不同情况，对打眼、装药、放炮、剥离一直到采掘方法都进行了一系列的改进。风钻工人和爆破工人，打眼时注意减少冲击力量，装药时，细心避免炸碎，防止混入废石。在露采的残缘部分，他们就采取先破顶板清理浮土然后采矿的办法，在剥离以后细心的清理掉浮土废石。皮祖春采矿小组工人，还在残缘部分加盖上一层树枝等障碍物，使爆破时许多矿石不会炸飞到山岩下而碰碎。窿采工人也根据窿内矿层薄、顶板底板距离近、废石极易混入的特点，推广了老工人徐昌才一次打眼、分次放炮的经验，不少困难都被他们克服了。
    河下铁矿四个大型开采工区生产的矿石，都要统一通过一个运矿工区运输下山，这是一个进一步保证矿石质量的重要关口。运矿工区的全体职工便主动与采矿工人紧密协作，全面调整了运输线路，革新了溜放工具，装卸时轻装轻放，基本上避免了运输过程中矿石互撞变成粉矿的现象。对于开采工区无法全部剔除干净的废石，运矿工人也采取了许多办法，在运输过程中剔除，使运输过程变成了一个选矿过程，从而大大地提高了外运矿石的品位。
    河下铁矿职工还一丝不苟地加强了质量检查、把关制度。全矿从领导干部、技术人员一直到广大工人群众，和专业的质量检查队伍紧密配合，人人都是检查员，个个都是选矿手。随时随地关心矿石质量，成了全矿的风气。班与班，工区与工区，上一个工序与下一个工序之间，又实行了互相评比、监督制度。（附图片）
    湖北武钢大冶铁矿采矿车间职工因地制宜革新矿石的运输方法，由过去单靠电机车运输改为汽车与电机车联合运输，使矿石的运输量比过去提高了二倍半，为高炉增产准备了充足的“精粮”。这是汽车正在给电机车装矿石　新华社记者　于澄建摄
