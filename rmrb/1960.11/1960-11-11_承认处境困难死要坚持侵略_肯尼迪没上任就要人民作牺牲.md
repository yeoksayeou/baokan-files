Xinhua News Agency, 10th November, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts: After learning of his election as the next President of the United States, Kennedy issued a statement on the 9th. In the statement, Kennedy said that the next four years "will be difficult and challenging years." He asked the American people to make greater sacrifices for the cause of the American ruling class, saying, "The coming years will require the greatest national effort to see our nation safely through the sixties." "France-Soir" published an interview with Kennedy on the same day after he received the newspaper's reporter alone. Kennedy said he would "strengthen America's position and prestige."

Kennedy also expressed his intention to uphold the Western countries' occupation of West Berlin. He reiterated the Eisenhower administration's policy of continuing to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands.

While saying he would negotiate with the Soviet Union on the issue of stopping nuclear tests, he also said that he would resume testing if American defense required it.

    新华社10日讯　美国马萨诸塞州海恩斯港消息：肯尼迪在获悉他当选为下届美国总统以后，9日发表了一项声明。肯尼迪在声明中说，今后四年“将是困难和富有挑战意味的岁月”。他要求美国人民为美国统治集团的事业作出更大的牺牲，他说，“在今后的年代里需要全国进行最大的努力来使我们国家安全地度过六十年代。”“法兰西晚报”同一天发表了肯尼迪单独接见该报记者的谈话。肯尼迪说，他将使“美国的地位和威信得到加强”。
    肯尼迪还表示要坚持西方国家对西柏林的占领。他重申了艾森豪威尔政府关于继续霸占中国的领土台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿的政策。
    他一面说将同苏联谈判停止核试验问题，一面说什么如果美国防务需要，他将恢复试验。
