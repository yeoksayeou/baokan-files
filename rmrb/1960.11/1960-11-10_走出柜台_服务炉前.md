Shanghai Commercial Department Employees Organize Work Groups to Reside in Key Steel Plants

    Stepping Out of the Counter, Serving the Furnace Front
    They not only prioritize the needs of the steel industry and proactively improve supply work, but also offer ideas, act as advisors, and help steel plants manage their "household affairs."

    (Reported by the *Jiefang Daily*) In the new situation of all-round support for the great increase in steel production, the Shanghai commercial departments have adopted a revolutionary measure: commercial personnel have formed work groups and are stationed in several key steel plants, taking root in workshops, construction sites, and furnace fronts, wholeheartedly supporting production. They have not only improved supply and service work but have also played an advisory role, earning enthusiastic praise from steel plant workers.

    After the commercial personnel were stationed in the factories, they first underwent significant changes in their thinking, feelings, and work style. They sincerely developed a sense of urgency for the needs of the steel industry and production. Previously, although they also went to the factories, they often only visited the supply and marketing departments and did not go to the front lines of production. Now, they not only directly participate in production and research work but also frequently move about in workshops and at furnace fronts, witnessing firsthand how steelworkers braved high temperatures to race against time in iron and steelmaking, deeply moved. A resident representative from a hardware station said: "In the past, sitting behind the counter, I was often unhurried when others were anxious; now that I am at the furnace, I truly see it with my own eyes, feel the urgency in my heart, and run ahead." Therefore, they proposed: "As long as the furnace front has urgent needs, even if our feet get blisters, we guarantee supply within the specified time." They have successively solved more than 1,300 problems, large and small, for the steel plants. This sense of urgency for the needs of the steel industry among the resident representatives has also spurred the enthusiasm of the vast number of commercial workers to support steel production. To solve the problem of certain critical parts, many stores often mobilized the entire staff to deliver materials to the furnace front in a timely manner. In the past month or so, the commercial departments have supplied several key steel plants with more than 600,000 items worth nearly 22.2 million yuan, many of which are urgently needed mechanical parts, accessories, various tools, and labor protection equipment.

    After the commercial workers took root in the front lines of production, the supply work became more proactive, timely, meticulous, and accurate. Not long ago, a Siemens-Martin furnace at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3 was undergoing early maintenance and urgently needed a batch of important pipe fittings. There were no goods available on the market. The resident representative, Sun Xiangqin, immediately contacted the hardware station and asked the relevant factory to rush the production overnight. The next day, when the steel plant's supply and marketing department submitted the material plan for furnace repair, these materials had already been delivered to the steel plant, much to the delight and praise of the comrades in the supply and marketing department.

    After the work groups took root in the front lines of production, they not only did a good job in supply but also stepped out of the simple buying and selling circle, proactively acting as advisors to the steel plants and helping them manage their "household affairs." They enthusiastically helped the factories clean up warehouses, take stock of their assets, and also organized a large number of repair and fitting services, bringing a large amount of scrap materials back to life. The commercial personnel stationed in the Machinery Repair Main Plant discovered that the factory needed a large amount of hardware and electrical materials, which were difficult to fully meet on the market for a while. They thought: Could they help the factory solve part of the problem through self-reliance? After obtaining the factory's consent, they mobilized the electricians, electrical material experts, and hardware equipment specialists from various stores to go to the factory to help, turning the scrap warehouse upside down. As a result, they cleared out thousands of immediately usable materials. For batches of damaged and scrapped tools, they organized forces to repair them urgently. The factory's purchasing agent excitedly said: "Now we can go one or two months without purchasing goods." Currently, all purchasing and supply stations are carrying out large-scale repair and reconditioning work in key steel plants. Participation in this repair service work for steel plants has also expanded to a large number of joint state-private stores and some neighborhood service stations. Thanks to everyone's joint efforts, not only have tens of thousands of pieces of production materials been repaired, but tens of thousands of pieces of scrap work clothes, cotton overcoats, steelmaking shoes and hats, gloves, glasses, bowls, and other protective and daily necessities are also being repaired, allowing them to play a role again.

    上海商业部门职工组织驻重点钢厂工作组
    走出柜台　服务炉前
    他们不但急钢之急，主动搞好供应工作，还出主意，当参谋，帮钢厂管好“家务”
    本报讯　据解放日报消息：在各方面支援钢铁大增产的新形势下，上海商业部门采取了一项革命性的措施：商业人员组成工作组，驻在几家重点钢厂里，把根子扎到车间、工地、炉前，全心全意支援生产。他们不但搞好了供应工作和服务工作，而且起了参谋作用，获得炼钢厂职工的热情赞扬。
    商业人员驻厂以后，首先在思想感情上和工作作风上起了显著的变化。他们由衷地产生了急钢之急、急生产之急的心情。以前，他们虽然也下厂，但往往只跑供销科，没有到生产第一线去。现在，不但直接参与生产，参与研究工作，还经常活跃在车间、炉前，亲眼看见钢铁战士冒着高温分秒必争地炼铁炼钢，深受感动。五金站的驻厂员说：从前坐在柜台里，往往人急我不急；现在人到了炉边，才真是看在眼里，急在心里，跑在头里。因此，他们提出：“只要炉前有急需，那怕脚底跑起泡，保证限时限刻供应好。”他们已先后为钢厂解决了一千三百多起大大小小的问题。驻厂员们这种急钢之急的心情，也推动了广大商业职工支援钢铁生产的热情。为了解决某些关键性零件，许多商店往往全店动员，及时把物资送到炉前。一个多月来，商业部门已为几个重点钢厂供应了价值近二千二百万元的六十多万件商品，其中不少都是急需的机械零件、配件、各式工具和劳动防护用品。
    商业职工把根子扎在生产第一线以后，供应工作做得更加主动、及时、细致和准确了。前不久，上钢三厂一座平炉提前检修，急需一批重要管道零件，市场无货供应，驻厂员孙祥钦立即同五金站联系后，请有关工厂连夜赶制；第二天，钢厂供销科提出修炉物资计划时，这批物资已送到了钢厂，乐得供销科的同志们称赞不已。
    工作组扎根到生产第一线以后，不仅做好了供应工作，而且跳出了单纯买卖的圈子，主动为钢厂做参谋，帮钢厂管好“家务”。他们热情地帮工厂清理仓库，盘点家底，还组织了大批修配服务力量，让大量废旧物资复活。驻在机修总厂的商业人员，发现工厂需要大量的五金、电器物资，市场上一时很难全部满足需要。他们就想：能不能帮工厂用自力更生的办法解决一部分呢？经征得工厂同意，他们发动各商店的电工电料和五金器材方面的能手，下厂帮助，将废品仓库来了个大翻身，结果清理出数千件立即可用的物资。对成批损坏报废的工具等，他们便组织力量进行抢修。工厂采购员兴奋地说：这下我们可以一两个月不进货了。现在，各采购供应站都在重点钢厂开展了大规模的修旧配新工作。参加这种为钢厂修理服务工作的，还扩展到了广大公私合营商店及部分里弄服务站。由于大家共同努力，不但修好了数以万件计的生产资料，而且正在整修数万件废旧工作服、棉大衣、炼钢鞋帽、手套、眼镜、饭碗等防护用品和生活用品，让它们重新发挥作用。
