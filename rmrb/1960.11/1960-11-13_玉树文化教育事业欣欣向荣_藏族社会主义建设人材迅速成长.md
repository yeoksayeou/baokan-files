    The Thriving Cultural and Educational Undertakings in Yushu:
    Rapid Growth of Tibetan Talents for Socialist Construction
    (Our report) Under the radiant illumination of the Party's ethnic policies, the cultural and educational undertakings in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have achieved unprecedented development. Currently, the prefecture has established fifteen secondary schools, with over 1,300 students, a 2.7-fold increase compared to 1958. The number of primary schools has reached over 160, with over 10,000 students, a 2.4-fold increase compared to 1958, basically popularizing primary school education. At the same time, the mass-based amateur cultural learning movement has also achieved great success. Currently, over 11,000 commune members are studying in 215 literacy classes. A total of 52 staff amateur schools (classes) have been built, with more than 85% of staff participating in amateur cultural learning.
    Before liberation, cultural education in the Yushu area was extremely backward. At that time, due to the reactionary rule's cruel exploitation, the poverty-stricken Tibetan people lived a primitive life without culture. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government attached great importance to the cultural and educational undertakings of ethnic minorities. Party committees and governments at all levels strengthened leadership, increased cultural and educational funding, and vigorously cultivated talents for socialist construction. Especially after the red flag of the People's Commune rose on the grasslands, a great upsurge in running schools was set off throughout the prefecture, and secondary schools for training Tibetan specialized talents in normal education, agriculture and animal husbandry, health, post and telecommunications, and finance and economics were established successively. In recent years, these schools have conscientiously implemented the Party's education policy, and have trained a total of 800 cadres who have been sent to various fronts, becoming the first generation of cultured socialist construction talents of the Tibetan people. Qi Xingyuan, who came from a poor herdsman family, has become the Secretary of the Jiangnan County Party Committee after being trained by the Party. Wu Jin Cai Ren, a shepherd boy from Angqian County, has become the Deputy Principal and Theory Teacher of the Party School of the Yushu Prefecture Party Committee after more than four years of study and training in the Party School of the Yushu Prefecture Party Committee.
    With the development of cultural and educational undertakings, cultural centers, cultural stations, clubs, film projection stations, and wired broadcasting stations have been established in various parts of the autonomous prefecture. The literary and artistic workers of the autonomous prefecture have also created more than 110 dance and music works, such as the large-scale dance drama "Precious Knife and Coral String."

    玉树文化教育事业欣欣向荣
    藏族社会主义建设人材迅速成长
    本报讯　在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，玉树藏族自治州的文化教育事业获得空前的发展。目前，全州已建起中等学校十五所，在校学生数达一千三百多人，比1958年增长二点七倍；小学已达到一百六十多所，在校学生一万多人，比1958年增长二点四倍，基本上普及了小学教育。与此同时，群众性的业余文化学习运动也取得很大成绩。现在，已有一万一千多名公社社员在二百一十五个识字班学习，职工业余学校共建五十二所（班），85％以上的职工都参加了业余文化学习。
    解放前，玉树地区文化教育十分落后，当时由于反动统治残酷剥削，饥寒交迫的藏族人民过着没有文化的原始生活。解放后，党和人民政府极为重视少数民族的文化教育事业，各级党委和政府加强领导，增加文化教育经费，大力培养建设社会主义的人材。特别是人民公社的红旗在草原上升起以后，全州掀起了大办学校的热潮，先后建起了培养藏族专门人材的师范、农牧、卫生、邮电、财经等中等学校。几年来，这些学校认真贯彻党的教育方针，先后共培养出八百名干部输送各个战线，他们成为藏族人民第一代有文化的社会主义建设人才。贫苦牧民出身的七兴元经过党的培养，如今已成为中共江南县委书记。昂欠县的放羊娃乌金才仁经过在中共玉树州委干部学校四年多的学习和培养，如今已成为州委党校的副校长兼理论教员。
    随着文化教育事业的发展，自治州各地现已办起文化馆、文化站、俱乐部、电影放映站、有线广播站等。自治州的文艺工作者还创作出大型舞剧“宝刀与珊瑚串”等舞蹈音乐作品一百一十多件。　（刘苹）（附图片）
