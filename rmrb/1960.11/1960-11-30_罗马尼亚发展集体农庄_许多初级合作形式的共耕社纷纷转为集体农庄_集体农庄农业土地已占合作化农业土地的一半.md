Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, November 28th: Collective farms in Romania are constantly developing and consolidating. Because many primary cooperative forms of mutual aid teams have been transformed into collective farms, the agricultural land area of collective farms now accounts for 50% of the total cooperativized agricultural land area.

Many individual farmers and members of mutual aid teams, seeing that collective farms can achieve high yields, have decided to join collective farms. In Cluj Region, eight new collective farms were established in a single day, October 23rd. In Bucharest Region, more than fifty new collective farms were established in October, including over 90,000 hectares of cultivated land. By October 1st, the number of collective farms nationwide had increased from 3,737 at the end of last year to 4,297, including more than 1,120,000 farm households and more than 3,740,000 hectares of agricultural land.

Now, the scale of collective farms has generally expanded. In 1956, each collective farm had an average of only ninety households, but now it has two hundred and sixty-two. At the same time, the average land area of collective farms has more than doubled.

With the help of the Party and the government, the economic foundation and agricultural production of collective farms are constantly being consolidated and developed. In Constanta Region, the first region in the country to achieve agricultural collectivization, the total public accumulation fund of collective farms was 140 million lei in 1957, and by the end of June this year, it had increased to 300 million lei. This year, the collective farms in Urziceni County, Bucharest Region, have an average wheat yield of 400 to 500 kilograms per hectare more than the mutual aid teams, and sunflower yields are 800 to 1,000 kilograms more.

In order to further develop the collective farm movement, Romania will take many measures. First, continue to publicize the superiority of collective farms, and persuade individual farmers and members of mutual aid teams through examples so that they are willing to join collective farms. Secondly, machine tractor stations will add nearly 10,000 tractors and various harvesters this year, and the state will increase the number of agronomists and animal husbandry specialists assigned to collective farms. This year, 5,500 collective farm cadres will receive professional training. In addition, the state will also provide collective farms with loans of 450 million lei this year to develop animal husbandry and sideline occupations.

    罗马尼亚发展集体农庄
    许多初级合作形式的共耕社纷纷转为集体农庄
    集体农庄农业土地已占合作化农业土地的一半
    新华社布加勒斯特28日电　罗马尼亚集体农庄不断发展和巩固。由于许多初级合作形式的共耕社已转为集体农庄，目前全国集体农庄的农业土地面积已占整个合作化了的农业土地面积的50％。
    许多个体农民和共耕社社员，看到集体农庄能够获得高产，都决定加入集体农庄。克罗什州在10月23日一天中就新成立了八个集体农庄。布加勒斯特州10月份新成立了五十多个集体农庄，包括九万多公顷耕地。到10月1日止，全国集体农庄已从去年年底的三千七百三十七个增加到四千二百九十七个，已包括一百一十二万多农户和三百七十四万多公顷农业土地。
    现在，集体农庄的规模一般都扩大了。1956年，平均每个集体农庄只有九十个农户，而现在是二百六十二户。同时，集体农庄的平均土地面积也增加了一倍多。
    在党和政府的帮助下，集体农庄的经济基础和农业生产都在不断巩固和发展。在全国第一个实现农业集体化的康斯坦萨州，集体农庄的公积金总数在1957年为一亿四千万列伊（罗币），到今年6月底已增加为三亿列伊。今年，布加勒斯特州乌尔齐切尼县的集体农庄，每公顷小麦的平均产量比共耕社多四百到五百公斤，向日葵多八百到一千公斤。
    为了使集体农庄运动进一步发展，罗马尼亚将采取许多措施。首先，继续宣传集体农庄的优越性，通过实例说服个体农民和共耕社社员，使他们愿意加入集体农庄。其次，机器拖拉机站今年将增加近一万台拖拉机和各种收割机，国家将为集体农庄增派农艺师和畜牧师。今年将有五千五百名集体农庄干部接受专业训练。此外，国家今年还将给集体农庄贷款四亿五千万列伊，以发展畜牧业和副业。
