Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, November 15th: Workers at the Fushun Victory Coal Mine are currently engaged in an "Ascending from the Well, Never Empty-Handed" competition. The content of this competition is that everyone takes action to recover discarded and used equipment parts scattered throughout the mine, which are then handed over to the mine for repair and reuse. Through the "Ascending from the Well, Never Empty-Handed" competition, all mine workers have further strengthened their thinking on running enterprises diligently and thriftily. Workers use every spare moment available during underground production to find ways to collect even a small nail or piece of iron, and then bring it back to the surface.

    “升井不空手”竞赛
    据新华社抚顺15日电　抚顺胜利煤矿职工正在开展“升井不空手”的竞赛活动。它的内容是人人动手，把散落在矿井下面的废旧设备零件回收起来，然后交给矿上修复加以利用。通过“升井不空手”的竞赛，全矿职工进一步加强了勤俭办企业的思想。工人们利用井下生产的点滴空隙时间，想方设法，把那怕是只钉寸铁也收集到手，然后带回井上。
