    War Hysteria Pervades the United States
        Underground Elementary Schools and "Nuclear Shelters"
    The American "Time" magazine of September 5 reported that recently, a very peculiar elementary school was built in the American city of Eltersay. Except for a flagpole left on the ground, the entire school building is built underground.

    Could it be that attending classes underground is beneficial to elementary school students' learning? No, the purpose of building this underground elementary school is not to provide children with a better learning environment, but supposedly for the needs of "civil defense." This elementary school with 540 student seats is mainly used as a nuclear shelter for 2,000 people. The underground elementary school has a cafeteria that regularly stores food rations for 14 days; the 18 classrooms all have closets that store 970 canvas beds; the school also has two-way radios, underground telephone lines, radiation protection equipment, fire-fighting equipment, etc.; in addition, two wells have been dug underground as an emergency water source.
          The "Psychological Value" of a Morgue
    Particularly surprising is that this school also has a morgue. Elementary school students pass by this room every day on their way to class, seeing the horrifying word "Morgue" conspicuously written on the door. But the principal of this elementary school announced: "Such equipment has important psychological value."

    What "psychological value" does a morgue have? The American ruling group has its own plans. They attempt to scare the American people by creating war hysteria, so that their actions of stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, and pursuing aggressive and war policies, will not be opposed at home.

    Because of this, the practice of building underground elementary schools is highly appreciated and encouraged by the American authorities' "civil defense" agencies. The construction cost of this type of underground school building is 10% higher than that of above-ground school buildings, and this difference is entirely subsidized by "civil defense" agencies.
            A Series of Intimidation Tactics
    Of course, building underground elementary schools is by no means the first attempt by the American ruling group to intimidate the American people. In fact, the United States has long been permeated with an atmosphere of war hysteria.

    People remember that as early as January this year, "U.S. News & World Report" published a map of "Radioactive Particles of Nuclear Weapons Spreading Across the United States," hypothetically depicting the destruction of most major cities after the United States suffered a large-scale nuclear attack in mid-October, with radioactive particles spreading across the United States, 50 million Americans dead, and 20 million seriously injured. In early February, the U.S. Senate passed a bill stipulating that when more than half of the 400-plus members of the House of Representatives die in an "atomic attack," state governors have the power to appoint replacements. In late February, New York Governor Rockefeller decided to allocate funds to build an underground state capitol building to protect against nuclear bombing, and also demanded that all homeowners in the state build atomic bomb shelters.

    In addition, the American "civil defense" agencies have also conducted a series of atomic war "exercises." In June, all 300 households in Burlington, New Jersey, moved into the forest and spent two nights there. In June, twenty-nine American citizens in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, including elderly people in their seventies and children as young as seven, were treated as "experimental animals" and driven into a small hole, supposedly for protection against nuclear weapons damage, to live for two weeks for testing.
          Don't Forget Forrestal's Fate
    Seeing these facts, people cannot help but recall the past of the first U.S. Secretary of Defense, Forrestal. This promoter of the Cold War finally scared himself to death and ended his life by jumping out of a building. Now, the new Forrestals in Washington still want to use intimidation and threats to promote aggressive policies and war policies. However, this can only make the people of the world and the American people further see the belligerent nature and ferocious face of the American ruling group, resolutely oppose the evil policies of the warmongers, and strengthen the struggle to defend peace. And Forrestal's successors, no matter how rampant they are now, will ultimately not have a better ending than their predecessors.

### 战争歇斯底里气氛弥漫着美国

    战争歇斯底里气氛弥漫着美国
        地下小学校和“核子避难室”
    9月5日的美国“时代”周刊报道，最近，在美国艾尔特塞城建筑了一所十分奇特的小学校。这所小学校除了一根旗杆留在地面上以外，整个校舍都建筑在地下。
    难道在地下上课对小学生的学习会有什么好处吗？不，建筑这座地下小学的目的并不是为了给儿童更好的学习环境，而据说是为了“民防”的需要。这所有着五百四十个学生座位的小学校，主要是用作二千人的核子避难室。地下小学校内有食堂，里面经常储藏着可供十四天食用的口粮；十八间教室里都有壁橱，里面储有九百七十张帆布床；学校里面还有双程无线电、地下电话线、防辐射设备、救火设备等；另外地下还掘有两口井，作为紧急水源。
          停尸间的“心理价值”
    特别令人惊奇的是，在这所学校里还设有一个停尸间。小学生每天上课都要经过这间屋子，看到怵目惊心地写在房间门上的“停尸间”这个可怖的字。而这个小学校的校长却宣布：“这样的设备具有重要的心理价值。”
    究竟停尸间有什么“心理价值”呢？美国统治集团有着自己的打算。他们企图用制造战争歇斯底里的办法来吓唬美国人民，以便使他们加紧扩军备战、推行侵略和战争政策的行动在国内不受到反对。
    正因为如此，建造地下小学校的作法，就大受美国当局“民防”机关的赞赏和鼓励。这种建筑在地下的校舍造价，要比地上校舍的造价高10％，这笔差额便由“民防”机构全部津贴。
            一系列的恐吓手法
    当然，建造地下小学校决不是美国统治集团恐吓美国人民的第一个尝试。事实上，在美国，早就弥漫着一片战争歇斯底里的气氛。
    人们记得，早在今年1月，“美国新闻与世界报道”上就刊登过一张“核武器的放射性微粒弥漫美国”的地图，假想在10月中旬美国遭到大规模的核进攻之后多数大城市被毁灭，放射性微粒弥漫美国各地，有五千万美国人死去，二千万人受重伤。2月初，美国参议院通过一项法案，规定当四百多名众议员有一半以上在“原子袭击”下死去时，各州州长有权任命人选来替补。2月下旬，纽约州州长洛克菲勒又决定拨款修建防备核弹轰炸的地下州议会大厦，并且要求州内所有房主建造原子弹避难所。
    此外，美国的“民防”机构还进行了一系列的原子战争的“演习”。6月份，新泽西州柏林敦全城三百户人家搬进森林里，并在那里度过了两夜。6月份，宾夕法尼亚州的匹兹堡有二十九个美国公民，其中包括七十多岁的老人和七岁的小孩，被当成“试验动物”驱进一个所谓防避核武器伤害的小洞里，居住两个星期以供试验。
          别忘了福莱斯特的下场
    看到这一些事实，人们不禁会回想起过去美国首任国防部长福莱斯特来。这个冷战的鼓吹者，最后终于吓破了自己的胆而用跳楼结束了自己的生命。现在，华盛顿的新的福莱斯特之流仍然想用恫吓、威胁的手法来推行侵略政策和战争政策。但是，这只能使全世界人民和美国人民进一步看到美国统治集团的好战本性和凶恶面目，坚决反对战争狂人的罪恶政策，加强保卫和平的斗争。而福莱斯特的继承者，不论现在多么猖狂，到头来是决不会得到比他们的前辈更好的下场的。
