Xinhua News Agency, 29th, London dispatch: The "Movement for the Liberation of the Angolan People" recently issued a statement in London condemning the Portuguese colonial authorities for increasing troops and persecuting the Angolan people. The statement said that a large number of Portuguese reinforcements have landed in Angola and built military fortresses in various parts of the country. The statement revealed that on November 2, eight African patriots were murdered in the colonial military prison in Luanda, the capital of Angola.

Since April last year, the Portuguese colonialists have taken various measures in an attempt to extinguish the Angolan people's struggle for freedom. However, contrary to the colonialists' wishes, the national independence movement in Angola is developing more and more vigorously.

    安哥拉人民决心求解放
    民族运动组织谴责葡殖民者暴行
    新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：“争取安哥拉人民解放运动”最近在伦敦发表声明，谴责葡萄牙殖民当局增兵迫害安哥拉人民。声明说，大批的葡萄牙增援部队已在安哥拉登陆，并在这个国家的各个地方筑起了军事堡垒。声明揭露说，11月2日，在安哥拉首府罗安达的殖民者军事监狱里，有八名非洲爱国者被杀害了。
    从去年4月起，葡萄牙殖民者采取各种手段，企图扑灭安哥拉人民争取自由的斗争，但是，与殖民者的愿望相反，安哥拉的民族独立运动愈来愈蓬勃发展。
