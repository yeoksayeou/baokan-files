Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 6th. The fighting spirit of Cuban workers, who are simultaneously preparing to counter American armed aggression and intensifying production, has deeply impressed the visiting Chinese trade union delegation.

On the 4th, the Chinese trade union delegation visited the "Orucelias" soap and spice factory in Havana, which was recently nationalized. During the visit to this factory, more than seven hundred workers were holding a meeting to discuss measures to increase production and practice economy, and unanimously decided to name this factory, which formerly belonged to American capitalists, the "Pepin Prieto" Soap Factory, after a Cuban revolutionary martyr. Union leaders, administrators, and many worker representatives who spoke at the meeting unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely defend the motherland, oppose American aggression, strive to increase production and practice economy, and protect machinery. The meeting proposed a target of saving 20,000 pesos per month. While many workers put forward individual plans to increase production and practice economy, they also emphasized the need to raise vigilance and resolutely suppress counter-revolutionaries.

Kang Yonghe, head of the Chinese trade union delegation, spoke to the workers. He introduced the experience of the Chinese working class in overcoming various difficulties, defeating the economic blockade of US imperialism, and developing production with their own resources over the past decade. He expressed his conviction that the heroic Cuban people, under the leadership of the revolutionary government headed by Castro, will undoubtedly overcome the economic blockade of imperialism and defeat American aggression as long as they maintain unity and persevere in their struggle. Kang Yonghe's speech won warm applause from the workers.

On the 5th, the Chinese trade union delegation visited the Havana railway station, carriage repair workshops, and a nearby sugar factory. During the visit, railway workers said that since nationalization, the production volume of the carriage repair workshop has increased by 40%. Currently, they are making use of all available scrap materials and repairing every repairable tool, and the workshop's militia is actively strengthening military training.

On the same day, the Chinese trade union delegation also visited the office of the Cuban National Railway Workers Union and attended a luncheon held by the union for the delegation. Jesus Soto, Organizational Secretary of the Cuban Workers' Federation, and Lazaro Pena, an outstanding leader of the Cuban workers' movement, also attended the banquet. At the banquet, the hosts and guests toasted each other to celebrate the solidarity between the working classes of the two countries.

The Chinese trade union delegation, headed by Kang Yonghe, stayed in Cuba for a visit after participating in the third meeting of the International Trade Union Support Committee for Algerian Workers and People.

    支持古巴工人的英勇斗争
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴工人一面准备反击美国武装侵略、一面加紧生产的战斗精神使正在这里访问的中国工会代表团获得了深刻的印象。
    4日，中国工会代表团访问了最近被收归国有的哈瓦那“奥鲁塞利亚斯”肥皂和香料厂。在访问这家工厂时，七百多名工人正在举行会议讨论增产节约措施，并且一致决定把这家过去属于美国资本家的工厂以古巴革命先烈的名字命名为“佩平·普烈托”肥皂厂。在会上发言的工会领导人、管理员和许多工人代表一致表示坚决保卫祖国、反对美国侵略、努力增产节约和保护机器的决心。会上提出了每月节约二万比索的指标。许多工人在提出增产节约的个人计划的同时，还强调必须提高警惕和坚决镇压反革命。
    中国工会代表团团长康永和同工人讲了话。他介绍了中国工人阶级在最近十年以来克服各种困难、战胜美帝国主义的经济封锁和用自己的资源发展生产的经验。他表示确信，英勇的古巴人民在以卡斯特罗为首的革命政府的领导下，只要保持团结和坚持不懈地斗争，必将毫无疑问地战胜帝国主义的经济封锁和击败美国的侵略。康永和的讲话博得了工人们热烈的掌声。
    5日，中国工会代表团参观了哈瓦那车站、车厢修配车间和附近的一家糖厂。在参观时，铁路工人说，在国有化以后，车厢修配车间的生产量提高了40％，目前他们正在利用一切可以利用的零碎原料和修理每一个可以修理的工具，车间的民兵正在积极加强军事训练。
    同一天，中国工会代表团还访问了古巴全国铁路工人联合会办事处，出席了这个工会为代表团举行的午宴。古巴工人联合会组织书记赫苏斯·索托和古巴工人运动杰出的领导人拉萨罗·培尼亚也出席了宴会。宴会上宾主之间互相举杯祝贺两国工人阶级之间的团结。
    以康永和为首的中国工会代表团是在参加了国际工会支援阿尔及利亚工人及人民委员会第三次会之后留在古巴参观访问的。
