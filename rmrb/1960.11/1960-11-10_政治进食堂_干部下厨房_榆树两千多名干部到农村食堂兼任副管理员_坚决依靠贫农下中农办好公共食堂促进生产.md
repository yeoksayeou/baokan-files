Politics Enters the Canteen, Cadres Go Down to the Kitchen
Elm Tree [Yushu] County Sends More Than 2,000 Cadres to Rural Canteens as Part-Time Deputy Administrators
Resolutely Rely on Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants to Run Public Canteens Well and Promote Production

(Our reporter from Changchun, 9th) The Yushu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jilin Province, grasping production with one hand and daily life with the other, insists on implementing the leadership method of "politics entering the canteen, cadres going down to the kitchen," and organizes 2,270 county, commune, and management district cadres to go deep into the canteens to serve as part-time deputy administrators, making the canteens better and better, and further improving the production enthusiasm of the masses.

After continuous consolidation and improvement, the 2,270-plus public canteens in Yushu County are increasingly popular among commune members, and the number of people joining the canteens has reached 96% of the total population. In order to run the canteens better, since October, the county party committee has selected 2,270 cadres at all levels to go deep into the canteens and serve as part-time deputy administrators. Secretaries, members of the county party committee, the county head, and heads of various departments have also gone deep into the canteens to work as cooks, exploring a set of canteen management experience and promoting the "one handover, two grasps, and three combinations" leadership method throughout the county.

"One handover" is: When cadres at all levels serve as part-time deputy canteen administrators, they must not only lead well, but also work as cooks for at least five days each month. Before cooking, they must explain the work they were originally responsible for, and after leaving the canteen, they must make good arrangements for the canteen work, and take over production. "Two grasps" are: grasp production during the day, and grasp daily life in the morning, noon, and evening. "Three combinations" are: When cooking, combine political and ideological education for the cooks to help improve their cooking skills; when resting in the evening, help the administrators summarize the day's work and arrange the food menu for the next five days; when eating, widely solicit opinions from commune members on the canteen and help commune members develop a plan for saving food. Yang Wanzhong, secretary of the county party committee secretariat, worked as a cook in the canteen of the Second Production Team of Changxin Management District, Wukeshu Commune. He found that there was no plan for food consumption, sometimes cooking too much and sometimes too little. He discussed with the administrator and adopted the method of announcing the food menu in advance, letting commune members order food and ration rice according to the number of people. As a result, the canteen changed from eating thirty catties of grain more than the standard every day to eating thirty catties of grain less. After the party branch secretary of Xinli Management District of Wukeshu Commune served as a part-time deputy administrator in the canteen of the Second Production Team, he found that some cooks were not at ease in their work, so he conducted education on one hand and helped solve practical difficulties on the other, and labored with them, so that they were encouraged, at ease in their work, and made meals that everyone was satisfied with.

After cadres at all levels served as part-time deputy administrators, they all helped the canteen improve the democratic management system. All canteens have established a life committee (composed of the production team leader, canteen administrator, cook, and one representative elected from every ten commune member households), which meets regularly to study canteen work. The canteen of the Third Team of Kalu Management District, Chengfa Commune, saved more than 900 catties of grain in just the first half of October because commune members participated in management. The canteen administrator originally planned to eat the saved grain in the second half of the month. Wang Yucheng, deputy secretary of the commune party committee who was serving as a part-time deputy administrator in this canteen at the time, convened a meeting of commune member representatives to discuss the issue. Everyone unanimously advocated that grain should be used sparingly, and that one should not have firewood for one stove and rice for one pot, and that one should live a rich life as if it were a poor life. Each canteen is equipped with an opinion book, an opinion box, a big-character poster platform, a commendation platform, a suggestion platform, and a grain-saving record book, trying every means to create conditions for commune members to participate in management.

After cadres at all levels went deep into the canteens, in the spirit of "ten years of harvest, nine years of planning, looking ahead and behind, and leaving room for maneuver," they relied on poor and lower-middle peasants to make specific arrangements for food consumption. First, they mobilized commune members to elect more than 300 party members, league members, poor peasants, and lower-middle peasants with high awareness and good at managing their lives as canteen administrators, cooks, grain administrators, and rice and flour processors, and adopted the method of "four personnel" guarding "four checkpoints," guarding the four checkpoints of grain storage, processing, income and expenditure, and grain weighing, linking them tightly together, each responsible for their duties, and plugging loopholes. In order to make commune members eat well and save money, increase nutrition, and after cadres at all levels served as part-time canteen deputy administrators, they actively helped develop non-staple food production. According to incomplete statistics, the county's canteens raised more than 30,000 pigs and more than 120,000 chickens, geese and ducks, and stored a lot of vegetables.

Politics entering the canteen and cadres going down to the kitchen are the keys to running the canteen well. With the canteen run well, it has powerfully promoted production. At present, more than 330,000 commune members in the county are joyfully investing in autumn plowing.

    政治进食堂  干部下厨房
    榆树两千多名干部到农村食堂兼任副管理员
    坚决依靠贫农下中农办好公共食堂促进生产
    本报长春9日电　中共吉林省榆树县委一手抓生产，一手抓生活，坚持实行“政治进食堂，干部下厨房”的领导方法，组织两千二百七十名县、公社、管理区的干部深入食堂，兼任副管理员，使食堂越办越好，进一步提高了群众的生产热情。
    榆树县两千二百七十多个公共食堂，经过不断地整顿和提高，越来越受社员欢迎，加入食堂的人数已占总人口的96％。为了把食堂办得更好，县委从10月份以来，选派了两千二百七十名各级干部，深入食堂，兼任副管理员。县委各书记、委员、县长，各部门负责人，也都深入食堂当炊事员，摸索出一套食堂管理经验，在全县推行了“一交接、两手抓、三结合”的领导方法。
  “一交接”是：各级干部在兼任食堂副管理员时，不但要领导好，而且每月最少要当五天炊事员，做饭前交代好原来负责的工作，走出食堂以后再把食堂工作做好安排，把生产接过来。“两手抓”是：白天抓生产，早、午、晚抓生活。“三结合”是：做饭的时候，结合对炊事员进行政治思想教育，帮助提高做饭、做菜技术；晚上休息的时候，帮助管理员总结当天的工作，安排下五天的伙食谱；吃饭时，广泛征求社员对食堂的意见，帮助社员制订节约用粮计划。县委书记处书记杨万众在五棵树公社长新管理区第二生产队食堂当炊事员，发现用粮无计划，有时做饭多，有时做饭少，便和管理员一起研究，采取了事先公布伙食谱的办法，让社员定饭，按人下米，结果，食堂由每天按标准多吃三十斤粮变成少吃三十斤粮。五棵树公社新立管理区党支部书记在第二生产队食堂兼任副管理员以后，发现有的炊事员不安心工作，就一面进行教育，一面帮助解决实际困难，并且和她们一起劳动，使她们受到鼓舞，工作安心了，饭菜做得人人满意。
    各级干部在兼任副管理员以后，都帮助食堂健全了民主管理制度。各食堂都建立了生活委员会（由生产队长、食堂管理员、炊事员和每十户社员选出一名代表组成），定期开会，研究食堂工作。城发公社卡路管理区三队食堂，由于社员参加管理，仅10月上半月就节省了九百多斤粮食。食堂管理员原来准备在下半月把这批节省的粮吃掉，当时在这个食堂兼副管理员的公社党委副书记王玉成同志就召开了社员代表大会，讨论这个问题。大家一致主张用粮要留有余地，不能有柴一灶有米一锅，要把富日子当穷日子过。每个食堂都设有意见簿、意见箱、大字报台、表扬台、献计台、节约用粮簿，想一切办法为社员参加管理创造条件。
    各级干部深入食堂以后，本着“十成年景，九成安排，瞻前顾后，留有余地”的精神，依靠贫农和下中农，对用粮做了具体安排。首先，发动社员推选了三百多名觉悟高、会过日子的党员、团员、贫农、下中农当食堂管理员、炊事员和粮食管理员以及米面加工员，采取了“四员”把“四关”的办法，把守粮食保管、加工、收支和下米过秤四个关口，环环扣紧，各负专责，堵塞了漏洞。为了使社员吃好吃省，增加营养，各级干部兼任食堂副管理员以后，积极帮助发展副食品生产。据不完全统计，全县食堂养猪达三万多头，养鸡鹅鸭十二万余只，并且贮备了许多蔬菜。
    政治进食堂，干部下厨房，是办好食堂的关键。食堂办好了，有力地促进了生产。目前，全县三十三万余名社员正喜气洋洋地投入秋翻地。
