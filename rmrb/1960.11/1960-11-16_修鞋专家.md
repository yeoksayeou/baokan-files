Shoe Repair Expert

One day, Jiao Wanyuan, a shoe repair worker from the Sanma Road Comprehensive Service Department in Tianjin, arrived at Tianjin University with his mobile cart. A student brought a pair of worn-out sneakers for him to fix. Jiao Wanyuan took the shoes, examined them carefully, and said, "You must be playing right inside forward, right? You must be good at dribbling..."

Usually, a simple patch would suffice for the torn area. However, Jiao Wanyuan thought, that kind of patch would be awkward when playing. So, he used an inlaid patching method to make the repair both smooth and durable.

Two days later, the student brought Jiao Wanyuan a ticket to a game: "Please come and watch a good game. I can tell you're an expert on soccer; you must be a fan." Jiao Wanyuan smiled and waved his hand, saying, "I do watch games often, but I'm no expert." The student was puzzled: "If you're not an expert, how could you tell my position and playing style from the way my shoes were torn?"

Jiao Wanyuan explained that in order to repair shoes well, he often watched various games and studied which areas of shoes were most prone to tearing and how to repair them better. He also paid attention to observing different people in his daily life. For example, when he rode the bus and saw the driver constantly stepping on various switches, he thought: when repairing shoe soles for bus drivers, one must use patterned tire soles that are durable and non-slip. In this way, Jiao Wanyuan gradually became a shoe repair expert. Every pair of shoes repaired by Jiao Wanyuan satisfied the customer.

   修鞋专家
    一天，天津市三马路综合服务部的修鞋工人焦万元，推着流动小车来到天津大学。一个同学拿来一双破球鞋让他给修理。焦万元拿过鞋来仔细端详了一下说：“你是踢右内锋的吧？不用说，你一定好带球……。”
    通常，只要在破的地方打个补钉就行了。可是，焦万元想：那样补法踢起球来怪碍脚的。他便用挖补的办法，把鞋补得既平整，又结实。
    两天后，这个同学给焦万元送来一张球票：“请你看场好球赛。我看你对踢球很内行，一定是个‘球迷’。”焦万元一边笑，一边摆手说：
  “我倒是常看球赛，可不是内行。”这个同学不禁有些奇怪：“你不是内行，怎么能从鞋破的地方看出我踢球时的位置和踢球的方法呢？”
    焦万元解释了一下，原来是这么回事：他为了把鞋修补好，有空常去看各种球赛，研究什么人的鞋哪个地方最容易破，怎样能修理得更好。平时他也注意观察各种人。如他乘公共汽车时，看到汽车司机不断蹬各种开关，他就想：给汽车司机修鞋底，一定要用带花纹的轮胎底，这样既结实，又不滑。就这样，焦万元逐步成了修鞋专家。凡是焦万元修理的鞋，没有一双不让顾客满意。天津市南开区
