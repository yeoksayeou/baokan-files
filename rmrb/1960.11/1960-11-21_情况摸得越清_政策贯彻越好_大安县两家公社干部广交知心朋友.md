(From Our Correspondent in Changchun, November 20th) Cadres at all levels of the Liangjia People's Commune in Daan County, Jilin Province, have made many close friends, further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses, thereby implementing the Party's policies and promoting the development of agricultural production.

After the Liangjia Commune implemented the "three-seven system" of leadership this year, cadres at all levels launched the "one person makes ten friends" activity while actively eating, living, laboring, and consulting with commune members. Each cadre made many close friends among the masses, promptly understanding the opinions and demands of the commune members, discovering problems existing in production and work, and studying solutions together. Now, all twenty-one members of the commune's Party committee and sixty cadres from the commune and management area have made more than eight hundred close friends. After the cadres made many close friends, they also consulted with their friends when implementing every major political task and solving key production problems, thus enabling the cadres to grasp the key aspects of production leadership.

Because the cadres had these close friends, many problems in life that were difficult to discover and solve in the past were also discovered and solved in a timely manner. Lin Fa, the Party branch secretary of the Qingxiang Management Area, learned about the living conditions of the commune members in the Third Production Team from his close friend, Cai Ziren, a grain processing worker. Cai Ziren said: This year, both grain and vegetables have had bumper harvests, and the commune members are eating well, but there is still waste. Now, we should quickly implement the grain quotas to each household and allocate grain to the dining halls. Lin Fa thought that what his close friend said was very correct. Therefore, he immediately worked with the team cadres to implement the grain rations to each person and household according to the retention standards, and allocated the rations of the commune members who joined the dining hall to the dining hall. In this way, from the dining hall managers and cooks to all the commune members, everyone consciously saved grain and vegetables, so that the dining hall used less grain and vegetables, and the commune members ate well, greatly improving the attendance rate and labor efficiency of the commune members.

After cadres at all levels of the Liangjia Commune had these close friends, they consulted with their friends and solved problems together when implementing the Party's policies and promoting increased production experience and technical measures. Li Fa, the secretary of the commune Party committee, was discussing the policy of vigorously developing agriculture and grain with his close friends in the Third Team of the Qingxiang Management Area one day, when some friends said: "Now the labor force in agriculture has greatly increased, and we must plant more land next year to produce more grain. We should start early to reclaim the autumn wasteland." Comrade Li Fa thought that this issue was very important, so he immediately helped the production team arrange manpower and allocate two pairs of oxen to plow the wasteland. Then, it was widely promoted throughout the commune, and the entire commune has reclaimed more than 1,800 mu of wasteland, creating favorable conditions for expanding the planting area next year.

In order to give play to the backbone role of close friends in the movement to vigorously develop agriculture and grain, cadres at all levels of the Liangjia Commune often use individual visits, field talks, small-scale forums and other forms to cultivate and improve their ideological awareness and understanding of the Party's policies, and through them establish close ties with a wider range of masses. Now, most of these close friends have become active responders and implementers of the Party's policies, and they are also strong shock workers in production. Moreover, twenty-two have been admitted as Party members, thirty have joined the Communist Youth League, and more than seventy have been included in the Party's list of red and expert activists.

    情况摸得越清　政策贯彻越好
    大安县两家公社干部广交知心朋友
    本报长春20日电　吉林省大安县两家人民公社各级干部广交知心朋友，进一步密切了干部和群众的关系，从而贯彻了党的方针政策，推动了农业生产的发展。
    两家公社今年执行“三七制”领导方法以后，各级干部在积极和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量中开展了“一人结十友”的活动。每个干部在群众中广交知心朋友，及时地了解社员的意见和要求，发现生产和工作中存在的问题，共同研究解决。现在，全社二十一名公社党委委员和六十名公社、管理区干部，已结交八百多名知心朋友。干部广交知心朋友以后，在执行每一个重大政治任务和解决生产关键问题时，也先找朋友商量，因而，使干部领导生产能够作到样样抓在关键上。
    由于干部有了这些知心朋友后，使过去在生活上许多不易及时发现和解决的问题，也及时发现和解决。庆享管理区党总支书记林发，在第三生产队和他的知心朋友、粮米加工员蔡子仁了解社员生活情况时，蔡子仁说：今年粮、菜都丰收，社员吃的都好，就是还有浪费。现在应该快把粮食指标落实到户，粮食落实到食堂。林发认为知心朋友说的很对。于是，他立即和队干部根据留量标准按人按户落实了口粮指标，并将入伙社员的口粮落实到了食堂。这样，从食堂管理员、炊事员到全体社员，人人都自觉的节约粮菜，使食堂作到了粮菜用的少，社员吃的好，大大提高了社员的出勤率和劳动效率。
    两家公社各级干部有了这些知心朋友后，在贯彻执行党的方针政策，推行增产经验和技术措施时，都作到了和朋友共同商量，共同解决。公社党委书记李发，在庆享管理区第三队，有一天，和知心朋友们谈论大办农业，大办粮食的方针时，有的朋友说：“现在农业上的劳动力大大增加了，明年必须多种地，才能打更多粮食，现在就应早动手开秋荒。”李发同志认为这个问题很重要，便立即帮助生产队安排了人力，套出两副牛犁开荒。接着，在全公社普遍推行，全公社已开垦出一千八百多亩荒地，为明年扩大播种面积创造了有利条件。
    两家公社各级干部为了发挥知心朋友在大办农业、大办粮食运动中的骨干作用，经常运用个别访问、田头谈心、开小型座谈会等形式，培养提高他们的思想觉悟和对党的方针政策的认识水平，并且通过他们同更广大的群众建立密切联系。现在，这些知心朋友大部分已成为党的方针政策的积极响应和执行者，在生产上也是强有力的突击手。并且已有二十二名被接收为党员，有三十名加入共青团，还有七十多名被列入了党的红专积极分子名单。
