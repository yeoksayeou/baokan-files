    De Gaulle Plays New Tricks
    France Announces "Referendum" in January Next Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 24th: The French government announced on the 23rd that it would hold a "referendum" in the first two weeks of January on De Gaulle's proposed bill to establish a so-called "provisional administrative body" in Algeria.
    De Gaulle is preparing to establish a so-called "provisional administrative body" in Algeria before the exercise of "self-determination," in an attempt to deceive the Algerian people and prolong colonial rule.
    De Gaulle's request for a "referendum" on this bill is an attempt to use this deceptive tactic to ease the strong opposition of the French people to France's colonial war in Algeria, and to subdue the French ultra-colonialist group that opposes De Gaulle's strategy.
    It is announced that this "referendum" will be held in France and Algeria (i.e., the French-controlled areas of Algeria).
    In order to better promote his strategy on the Algerian issue, De Gaulle has transferred his confidant, former Minister of Education Joxe, to the post of Minister of State for Algerian Affairs, and appointed another confidant, Molin, to replace Delouvrier as the French Delegate-General in Algeria.

    戴高乐玩弄新骗术
    法国宣布明年一月举行“公民投票”
    新华社24日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府23日宣布，将在明年1月的头两个星期内就戴高乐提出的关于建立所谓阿尔及利亚“临时行政机构”的法案举行“公民投票”。
    戴高乐准备在阿尔及利亚建立所谓行使“自决权”之前的“临时行政机构”，企图以此来欺骗阿尔及利亚人民、苟延殖民统治。
    戴高乐要求就这个法案举行“公民投票”，企图通过这种欺骗手法来缓和法国人民对法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争的强烈反对，并且借此压服反对戴高乐的策略的法国极端殖民主义者集团。
    据宣布，这次“公民投票”将在法国和阿尔及利亚（即阿尔及利亚的法国控制地区）举行。
    为了更好推行他在阿尔及利亚问题的策略，戴高乐已经把他的亲信、原任教育部长若克斯调任阿尔及利亚国务部长，并且任命另一个亲信摩兰去接替德路弗里埃，担任法国驻阿尔及利亚总代表。
