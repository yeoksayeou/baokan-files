Shanghai New Products

	Universal Chassis Tractor
    A new type of tractor—a sixteen-horsepower universal chassis tractor—is currently on display at the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition. The chassis of this tractor can be fitted with various agricultural implements, such as plows, seeders, or harvesters, according to different needs, for plowing, sowing, harvesting, or transporting. The tractor's engine can also be used as a power source to drive irrigation and drainage machines, threshers, or other working machines through a universal shaft. The distance between the tractor's tires can be freely adjusted, making it suitable for traveling on roads of varying widths in rural areas. This was manufactured by workers at the Shanghai Tractor Factory based on the actual needs of the countryside.

	Advanced Electric Cranial Drill
    Doctors generally use hand-cranked cranial drills when performing surgery on a patient's head. However, in cases of emergency rescue for acute brain tumors and concussions, this type of hand-cranked cranial drill is slow and inconvenient to operate. Workers at the Shanghai Tongxin Medical Equipment Factory, based on medical needs and adopting a combination of internal and external methods, top-down and bottom-up approaches, and indigenous and foreign techniques, have successfully trial-produced an advanced electric cranial drill. This cranial drill is extremely precise; after drilling through the skull, the drill bit will automatically stop upon touching the meninges. The drill is also equipped with a safety positioning needle to ensure surgical safety. The time required for surgery using this electric drill is reduced by nine-tenths compared to using a hand-cranked drill, and it is also easy and flexible to operate.

	Fire-Resistant Wood Boards
    The Shanghai No. 1 Timber Factory conducted an interesting experiment: two wood boards of the same size, one ordinary wood board and one wood-based plywood manufactured by the factory, were placed in the flame of a 900-degree Celsius alcohol blowtorch. The ordinary wood board was completely reduced to ashes within one minute, while the plywood remained unharmed.

    This plywood is one of three types of plywood successfully manufactured by the No. 1 Timber Factory. It was trial-produced using indigenous methods by a youth team in the factory's laboratory.

	Double-Sided Dyed Khaki Fabric
    A skillful tailor can make a garment that is a People's Suit on one side and a reversible jacket or other style of clothing on the other. But it would be even more ideal if one side were light gray and the other side were beige. In order to satisfy this desire, the Shanghai Yangpu Cotton Textile Factory has woven this double-sided dyed khaki fabric. This khaki fabric is woven with eighty-count yarn, and both sides are colorfast and the texture is very strong.

	Durable Fancy Socks
    The sock bottom is the easiest part of a sock to wear out. Now there is a novel type of sock: reinforced fancy socks, the bottom of which is interwoven with one nylon thread and one cotton thread. Because of the addition of this nylon thread, the service life can be extended by one time compared to ordinary fancy socks. It is very popular among consumers after being sold on the market. This is a new product from the Shanghai Yangpu Cotton Textile Factory.

	Wonderful Electronic Organ
    An electronic organ manufactured by the Guoguang Harmonica Factory looks very much like a small harmonium. By simply pressing different timbre switches, you can play the sounds of more than fourteen different orchestral instruments on the same keyboard: it can be a graceful violin, or a soaring oboe, a majestic tuba, and it can also play the sounds of various instruments such as the pipa and the flute, and the timbre is exactly the same. This electronic organ uses vacuum tube oscillation to produce sound. It is also equipped with a radio receiver that can receive broadcasts.

	Multi-functional Camera
    In a photo studio, there is a camera for taking pictures, an enlarger for enlarging pictures, a printer for printing pictures... So many machines cost a lot of materials and man-hours to produce, and the purchase costs are also very high. Employees of the Shanghai May 1st Camera Factory have recently successfully manufactured a camera with "one top six" functions, which can be used for indoor and outdoor photography, as well as for copying, enlarging, printing, and flash photography. The camera is equipped with two linked flashlights and three lenses with different focal lengths. This camera saves a great deal on materials and manufacturing man-hours compared to manufacturing six machines, and it is also very convenient to use.

    上海新产品	万能底盘拖拉机
    一种新型拖拉机——十六马力万能底盘拖拉机，最近正在上海工业展览会上展出。这种拖拉机的底盘，可以根据不同需要，装上铧犁、播种机或收割机等各种农具，用来翻土、播种、收割或运输。拖拉机上的发动机，还可以通过一根万向轴，作为牵动排灌机、脱谷机或其它工作机的动力。这种拖拉机的轮胎之间的距离，可以自由伸缩，适宜在农村宽窄不同的道路上行驶。这是上海拖拉机厂工人，根据农村的实际需要而制造出来的。	高级电动颅骨钻
    医生在病人的脑袋上动手术，一般是用手摇颅骨钻。可是，在抢救急性脑瘤和脑震荡等的情况下，这种手摇颅骨钻就显得速度慢，操作不方便。上海同心医疗器械厂的工人，根据医疗上的需要，采取内外结合、上下结合、土洋结合的办法，试制成功了一种高级电动颅骨钻。这种颅骨钻精密度极高，在钻穿颅骨以后，钻头碰到脑膜会自动停止。钻上还装有保险定位针，保证手术安全。用这种电动钻动手术的时间，要比用手摇钻缩短十分之九，而且操作起来轻便灵活。	不怕烈火的木板
    上海木材一厂作过这样一次有趣的试验：用两块同样大小的木板，一块是普通木板，一块是这个厂制造的木质胶合板，放在摄氏九百度酒精喷灯的烈火中燃烧，普通的木板，在一分钟内就全部化为灰烬，而胶合板却安然无恙。
    这种胶合板是木材一厂制造成功的三种胶合板之一。它是这个厂试验室的一个团小组的青年，用土办法试制成功的。	双面染色的卡其布
    高明的裁缝师傅，能把一件衣服做成正面是人民装，反过来又成为两用衫，或者其他式样的服装。但如果正面是浅灰色，反过来又是米色，就更为理想了。上海杨浦棉纺织厂为了满足这种愿望，就纺织出了这种双面染色的卡其布。这种卡其布用八十支纱织成，两面两种颜色都不脱色，质地也很结实。	质地结实的花袜
    袜子最容易磨破的是袜底。现在有一种新颖的袜子：加固花袜，它的袜底是用一根尼龙一根棉纱交织而成的。因为加了这一根尼龙，使用寿命就可以比一般花袜延长一倍。在市场销售以后，极受消费者的欢迎。这是上海杨浦棉纺织厂的新产品。	奇妙的电子琴
    国光口琴厂制造的一种电子琴，外形很像一架小型的风琴，你只要揿一下不同的变音开关，就能在同一个键盘上弹奏出十四种以上不同管弦乐器的音响：可以是幽美的小提琴，或者是高扬的双簧管、雄浑的大喇叭，还可以奏出琵琶、笛子等各种乐器的声音，而音色完全一样。这种电子琴是利用电子管振荡发音的。它上面还装有一只无线电收音机，可以收听广播。	多能的照相机
    在照相馆里，照相有照相机，放大有放大机，印片有印片机……这么多的机具，生产时费料费工时，购买时费用也很高。上海五一照相机厂职工，最近制造成功一种用途“一顶六”的照相机，既可用于室内和室外摄影，又可翻版、放大，还可以印片和闪光摄影。摄影机上配有两只联动闪光灯和三种不同焦距的镜头。这种照相机在材料上、制造工时上都比原来要制造六种机具大为节省，使用也很方便。
