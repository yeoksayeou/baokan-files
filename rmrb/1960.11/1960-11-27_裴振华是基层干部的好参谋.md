Pei Zhenhua used to work in the Rural Work Department of the Yuncheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi. During the great drought fighting this summer, he was in Zhangcun Production Team of Yuncheng Commune, fighting the drought alongside the commune members, and became quite familiar with them. In August of this year, when the Party called on cadres to go to the front line of agricultural production and to the most difficult places, he accepted the Party's assignment and became the deputy leader of the Zhangcun Production Team.

As soon as Pei Zhenhua arrived at the Zhangcun Production Team, he discovered that Deputy Leaders Zhang Zhonghe and Li Bingli had many common advantages: they often participated in labor, were hard-working and simple, and treated the team as their home. The commune members often praised them, saying, "Zhonghe and Bingli are really good; they do all kinds of work, speak reasonably, and know how to lead production." Pei Zhenhua was determined to learn from them. Pei Zhenhua was not afraid of hardship or difficulty, and always took the lead in labor. He lived in the homes of commune members, helping with sweeping the courtyard and fetching water. People called him an "Old Eighth Route Army."

One day, he said to Team Leader Liu Fahe, "Let's also have an attendance chart for cadres so that they can all participate in production well and also be supervised by everyone." Liu Fahe very much agreed with this approach. So, the attendance chart for team cadres was immediately established. This further promoted the enthusiasm of cadres to participate in production. In August, the eight team cadres had a total of 182 attendance days, working 175 labor days; in September, the attendance days increased to 220, working 219 labor days; and in October, it further increased to 235 attendance days and 247 labor days.

Pei Zhenhua influenced others by setting an example in everything he did, always choosing the heaviest burdens to bear. During the "Three Autumns" work, the task of planting wheat was great, and strengthening the management of livestock feed was an extremely important task. So, he moved his luggage and lived with the feeders in the stable to feed the livestock, helping the feeders improve their methods of feeding. As a result, the livestock grew strong and fat. When the team cadres saw that this method was very effective, everyone imitated his approach and took the lead in everything. Some cadres moved to the threshing ground to live and work with the commune members, which greatly promoted production.

Pei Zhenhua also had another characteristic: he always thought of the masses, trusted the masses, and consulted with the masses on matters. Soon after he was sent down to the Zhangcun Production Team, he organized veteran peasants such as Liu Yuliang and Liu Shengwang to form an "Old Peasant Advisory Group," inviting them to be advisors to the team committee and teach the team cadres production knowledge. The veteran peasants, seeing that the team valued them so much, actively contributed their experience and played a great role in the "Three Autumns." And the team cadres have since become even closer to the masses, developing the habit of consulting with the masses on matters.

In early September, some commune members reflected that the food in the canteen was monotonous. Pei Zhenhua thought: the canteen is the key to improving livelihood and is a red flag after the rural people's communization, so it must be run well. With the leadership's approval, he went to the canteen to take charge of the meals. By burning fire and cooking with the cooks, and conducting economic accounting with the steward, he found that the main reason for the poor food in the canteen was the lack of non-staple foods. So, he led the commune members to open up avenues to obtain non-staple foods: on the one hand, he mobilized the commune members to plant vegetables in every possible way, reaching 130 mu; on the other hand, he organized some commune members to collect more than 125,000 jin of wild vegetables from outside. He also heard that the canteen in Xiaoli Village was run well, so Pei Zhenhua organized the cooks and stewards to visit and learn from Xiaoli Village. As a result, the canteen food quickly improved greatly. Pei Zhenhua knew that running the canteen well could not rely on one person, so he organized the commune members to discuss how to run the canteen well, and a canteen management committee was established, mainly composed of Party members and poor and lower-middle peasants. The management committee, based on the opinions of the masses, implemented a multi-stove system in one hall, in addition to the main stove for ordinary commune members, there were also stoves for the elderly, pregnant women, and patients. Each stove combined the characteristics of different groups and made different meals. Because the elderly were inconvenient to move around, a youth service team was organized to serve the elderly during meals.

Therefore, the cadres of the Zhangcun Production Team called him their "good advisor," and the commune members called him their "confidant."

    裴振华是基层干部的好参谋
    裴振华原在中共山西运城县委农村工作部工作，今年夏天大闹抗旱的时候，他就在运城公社张村生产队和社员们一起抗旱，同社员们相处得挺熟。今年8月，党号召干部到农业生产第一线、到最艰苦的地方去的时候，他接受了党的分配，到张村生产队当了副队长。
    裴振华一下放到张村生产队，就发现了副队长张中合、李秉立有着许多共同的优点：经常参加劳动，艰苦朴素，以队为家。社员们常常赞扬说：“还是人家中合、秉立行，啥活都干，说话在理，会领导生产。”裴振华就决心向他两人学习。裴振华不怕吃苦，不怕困难，劳动中处处走在社员头里。住在社员家里，不是帮助扫院，就是帮助打水，人们称他是一个“老八路”。
    一天他对队长刘法合说：“咱们干部也搞个考勤榜，让干部们都能好好参加生产，还能得到大家的监督。”刘法合很赞成这个作法。于是队干部的考勤榜就马上建立了。这样进一步促进了干部参加生产的积极性。八个队干部8月份出勤日一百八十二个，作了一百七十五个劳动日；9月份出勤日二百二十个，作了二百一十九个劳动日；10月份又进而提高为二百三十五个出勤日，二百四十七个劳动日。
    裴振华处处以身作则影响别人，专拣重担子挑。“三秋”工作中种麦任务大，加强牲畜的饲料管理是一项极重要的工作，他就搬上行李和饲养员一起住到马棚喂牲口，帮助饲养员改进了喂牲口的方法。结果牲口一个个长得肥壮。队干部们看到这办法收效很大，人人都仿效他的作法，事事带头干。有的干部搬到场里和社员一块劳动居住，大大促进了生产。
    裴振华还有个特点：就是处处想到群众，相信群众，有事同群众商量。他下放到张村生产队不久，就把老农刘玉良、刘升旺等组织起来，成立了“老农参谋部”，请他们作为队委会的顾问，教给队干部们生产知识。老农们看到队里这样重视他们，都积极把自己的经验贡献出来，在“三秋”中发挥了很大作用。而队干部们也从此更加密切了与群众的关系，养成了有事和群众商量的习惯。
    9月初，一部分社员反映食堂的饭菜单调。裴振华心想：食堂是搞好生活的关键，是农村人民公社化后的一面红旗，一定得办好。经过领导同意，他下食堂抓起伙食来了。他通过和炊事员一齐烧火做饭，一块和事务长进行经济核算，找到了食堂伙食不好的主要原因是缺乏副食品。于是就领导社员广开门路搞副食品：一面发动社员千方百计种植蔬菜达一百三十亩；一面组织部分社员到外边采集野菜十二万五千多斤。又听人说，小李村的食堂办得好，裴振华就组织炊事员和事务长到小李村去参观学习。这样一来，食堂伙食很快就有了很大改进。裴振华知道要办好食堂靠一个人还不行，又组织社员进行了如何办好食堂的讨论，以党员和贫雇农为主成立了食堂管理委员会。管理委员会又根据群众的意见，实行了一堂多灶，除了普通社员的大灶，还有老年人灶、孕妇灶、病人灶。各灶都结合不同对象的特点，作不同的饭食。老年人行动不方便，就组织青年服务队，吃饭时服侍老人。
    因此，张村生产队的干部们称他是自己的“好参谋”，社员称他是自己的“知心人”。
