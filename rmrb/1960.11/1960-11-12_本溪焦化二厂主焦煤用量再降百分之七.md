    Benxi Coking Plant No. 2 Further Reduces Use of Prime Coking Coal by Seven Percent
    (Our newspaper, Benxi, 11th dispatch) Benxi Iron and Steel Company's No. 2 Coking Plant is making every effort to save prime coking coal and has achieved remarkable results. Following a reduction in the proportion of prime coking coal from 45% to 36% in the first half of this year, it has now been reduced to about 29%, saving the country 15,000 tons of prime coking coal.
    In order to save more coking coal, the plant's Party committee conducted a series of educational sessions for coking workers on saving coal, calling on workers not to lose a piece of coal or a piece of coke, and put forward the topic of "using less prime coking coal to produce good coke," mobilizing workers to offer suggestions and improve operating techniques to break through the production key to reducing the amount of prime coking coal used. In the airing of views and debates, the workers put forward more than 500 innovation suggestions. At this time, the factory's Party committee organized experienced coking workers and technicians to conduct detailed operational experiments on the main coking production processes, such as adjusting the fire, adding coal, and pushing coke. In the experiment, the fire adjusters adopted the "fine adjustment of fire" operating method to keep the temperature of the coke oven normal. They took the initiative to establish contact with the weather station, kept abreast of the changes in the weather at all times, and adjusted the furnace temperature by adjusting the opening of the wind baffle and changing the suction of the flue according to the different air temperatures and wind directions. As a result, they quickly broke through the key to adjusting the fire. Subsequently, the Party committee carried out a series of reforms targeting coal adding, coke pushing, and other processes. After painstaking research, the coal adding workers improved the coal hopper and coal leveling bar of the coal adding vehicle and other equipment, which not only expanded the amount of coal added, but also saved raw material consumption. In the fire extinguishing operation, the workers studied and developed the method of matching the fire extinguishing car and the water spray pipe to extinguish the fire, which greatly reduced the phenomenon of coke fragmentation and excessive moisture, correspondingly improved the coke lumpiness and strength, and created favorable conditions for saving prime coking coal.
    After the success of the experiment of using a small amount of prime coking coal to produce good coke, the factory Party committee immediately incorporated a series of new operating methods that emerged in the experiment into the technical operating regulations and actively organized relevant employees to earnestly implement them. When arranging the supply plan for coking coal varieties in November, the plant took the initiative to request less prime coking coal to ensure the production of better quality and greater quantities of coke.

    本溪焦化二厂主焦煤用量再降百分之七
    本报本溪11日电　本溪钢铁公司第二焦化厂千方百计节约主焦煤，获得显著成绩，继今年上半年主焦煤比例由45％降低到36％以后，目前又降低到29％左右，为国家节约了一万五千吨主焦煤。
    为了节约更多的焦煤，这个厂的党委曾向炼焦职工进行了一系列的节约焦煤的教育，号召职工不丢一块煤，不掉一块炭，并且提出“少用主焦煤、炼出好焦炭”的课题，发动职工献计献策，改进操作技术，突破降低主焦煤用量的生产关键。职工们在鸣放辩论中，提出了五百多项革新建议。这时，工厂党委即组织有经验的炼焦工人和技术人员，在调火、加煤和推焦等炼焦主要生产工序上，进行了细致的操作试验。在试验中，调火工人为了使焦炉的温度保持正常，采取
  “细调火”的操作方法。他们主动和气象站建立联系，随时掌握气象的变化，按着气温风向的不同来调节风板开度，改变烟道吸力等办法进行调节炉温。结果迅速突破了调火关键。接着，党委又针对加煤、推焦等工序进行了一系列的改革。加煤工人经过刻苦钻研，改进了加煤车煤斗和平煤杆等设备，不仅扩大了加煤量，而且还节省了原料消耗。在消火操作上，工人们研究成消火车和喷水管对口灭火的方法，大大减少了焦炭碎裂、水份过多的现象，相应地提高了炭焦块度和强度，为节约主焦煤创造了有利条件。
    用少量主焦煤炼出好焦炭试验成功以后，工厂党委立即把试验中出现的一系列新的操作方法，纳入技术操作规程，并积极组织有关职工认真执行。在安排11月炼焦煤种供应计划时，这个厂已主动地提出少要主焦煤，保证炼出质量更好数量更多的焦炭。
