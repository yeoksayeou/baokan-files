　　Driving down the Sanda Mountain along the east bank of the Lancang River, we could see from afar, on the other side of the rolling river, amidst a green sea of tropical trees, the dots of red tiles and pink walls, which is Jinghong, the capital of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture.

　　Jinghong is an ancient city, formerly known as Cheli. As early as the end of the twelfth century, the feudal lords of the Dai ethnic group ruled Xishuangbanna and made it their capital. More than forty years ago, Yunnan warlord Ke Shuxun established the "Pusi Border Administration Bureau" here, ruling the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna. For nearly eight hundred years, the rice harvested by the hardworking Dai people was stored in the lords' granaries, and the silver earned by the blood and sweat of the people of all ethnic groups was stuffed into the pockets of warlords and bureaucrats! And what did these bloodsuckers leave behind?

　　In 1951, when the ethnic minority visiting delegation sent by the Central People's Government arrived here, besides a dilapidated "yamen" built by Ke Shuxun, and three small foreign buildings where American missionaries conducted cultural aggression, the entire ancient city of Cheli only had a half-section of earthen city wall surrounding a dilapidated street of a few dozen zhang long, inhabited by a dozen or twenty households struggling in the grip of malignant malaria, with a hundred or so residents. Weeds grew knee-high, and the scene was desolate, so much so that some comrades still asked on the street, "Where is Cheli?"

　　Now, Jinghong has completely changed. What appears before us is a brand-new, beautiful city full of tropical scenery. Fiery red phoenix flowers bloom all over the branches, tall coconut trees reach towards the blue sky, and neat, wide, tree-lined roads stretch straight into the distance. Along the roadsides, neat rows of five-colored buildings in beige, white, pink, and light green stand, shining brightly in the sun. The neat office building is the leading organ of the autonomous prefecture, the department store and Xinhua Bookstore bustling with customers, the cinemas, hotels, bus stations, and restaurants bustling with activity, the ethnic hospital where white-clad girls come and go, the scientific research institutions hidden in the greenery, the machinery, paper-making, oil-pressing, and brick and tile factories that make deafening rumbling sounds, the primary and secondary schools that emit loud reading voices, and the places where the zhi luo and elephant-foot drums are played thunderously are where the autonomous prefecture's theater troupe is rehearsing new songs and dances... In just ten years, the Party and the People's Government have brought so much happiness and joy to the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna; the population of Jinghong has increased from more than one hundred to more than eight thousand, becoming the political, economic, and cultural center of Xishuangbanna in the true sense of the word.

　　At the first normal school in Xishuangbanna, we saw more than one hundred future teachers from all over the prefecture studying here, belonging to eleven ethnic groups. Before liberation, only Dai children had the opportunity to learn the Dai language by becoming monks in Buddhist temples. Most other ethnic groups relied on primitive methods such as carving wood and tying knots to record events. Now, the Dai people have their own college students, doctors, teachers, and technicians.

　　Even before arriving in Jinghong, we knew that it used to be a famous "miasma" area, and the prevalence of malignant malaria had wiped out this city, which once had a population of 10,000. Therefore, we visited the autonomous prefecture's ethnic hospital with particular concern. This hospital has more than eighty beds and X-ray equipment. When we asked about the prevalence of malignant malaria, a doctor surnamed Zhao told us a story. More than forty years ago, when Yunnan warlord Ke Shuxun was building the "yamen" here, he brought more than five hundred construction workers from the interior. After two years of construction, only a few of these five hundred workers were still alive; the others had been taken by malignant malaria!

　　After liberation, the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army first sent a large number of medical personnel to eradicate malignant malaria and fight against death. After ten years of hard work, the incidence of malignant malaria has been reduced to below 1%. Malaria can be eliminated this year. Now, the autonomous prefecture has this ethnic hospital with internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and other departments, and each county in the autonomous prefecture has a health center, each district has a health station, and each village has a health worker and a midwife. "Miasma" and imperialism, warlord bureaucrats, and feudal lords have all been swept out of this area! The people of all ethnic groups have begun to live healthy, civilized, and prosperous lives.

    充满热带风光的城市
    黄昌禄
    汽车沿着澜沧江东岸的三达山盘旋而下，我们远远望见滚滚大江的彼岸，一片碧绿的热带树海中，浮现出点点朱瓦粉墙，这便是西双版纳傣族自治州的首府允景洪。
    允景洪是一座古老的城市，旧称车里。远在十二世纪末期，傣族的封建领主统治了西双版纳，就把这里作为首府。四十多年以前，云南军阀柯树勋在这里设立了“普思沿边行政总局”，统治西双版纳的各族人民。将近八百年间，勤劳的傣族人民收获的稻米被领主装进自己的谷仓，各族人民血汗换来的银元被军阀、官僚装进他们的腰包！而这些吸血者又在这里留下些什么呢？
    1951年，中央人民政府派来的民族访问团到达这里时，除了柯树勋修的一座破旧“衙门”，和美帝国主义传教士在这里进行文化侵略活动的三幢小洋楼以外，整个车里古城只有半条土城墙围着一条十几丈长的破烂街道，住着在恶性疟疾包围中挣扎着的一、二十户人家，百十来个居民。野草没膝，满目荒凉，以致有的同志走到街头还在打听：“车里在哪里？”
    现在，允景洪完全变了，出现在我们面前的是一个崭新的、充满热带风光的美丽城市。火红的凤凰花开满枝头，高大的椰子树撑向蓝天，一条条整齐宽广的林荫马路笔直地伸向远方。道旁整齐地矗立着一座座米黄色的、白色的、粉色的、浅绿色的五色缤纷的建筑，在太阳下闪闪发光。那整齐的办公大楼是自治州的领导机关，那顾客盈门的是百货大楼和新华书店，那熙熙攘攘的是电影院、旅馆、汽车站和饭馆，那白衣姑娘出没的是民族医院，那隐在绿荫丛中的是科学研究机关，那发出震耳的机器隆隆声音的是机械、造纸、榨油和砖瓦工厂，那传出朗朗读书声的是小学和中学，芝锣和象脚鼓被敲得震天响的地方是自治州的剧团正在排演新的歌舞……短短十年，党和人民政府给西双版纳的各族人民带来了多少幸福和欢乐；允景洪的居民由一百多人增加到八千多人，成为西双版纳名副其实的政治、经济和文化的中心。
    在西双版纳的第一所师范学校里，我们看见了来自全州各地的一百多名未来的教师在这里学习，他们分别属于十一种民族。解放前，只有傣族儿童进佛寺当和尚才有学习傣文的机会，其它民族大都靠着刻木结绳等原始方法来记事。现在，傣族人民有了自己的大学生、医生、教师和技术人员。
    还在到允景洪以前，我们就知道这里过去是有名的“瘴气”区，恶性疟疾的流行使这个曾经拥有一万居民的城市人烟灭迹。因此我们怀着特别关切的心情访问了自治州民族医院。这个医院有八十多张病床，还有X光设备。当我们问起恶性疟疾流行的事情时，一位姓赵的医生向我们介绍了一个掌故。那是在四十多年以前，云南省的军阀柯树勋在这里修建“衙门”时，曾从内地带来五百多名建筑工人。房子造了两年，这五百多名工人中还活在人间的只有几个，其它的都被恶性疟疾夺去了生命！
    解放了，人民政府和解放大军首先就派出大批医疗人员来根治恶性疟疾，和死亡作斗争。经过十年艰苦的努力，恶性疟疾的发病率已经降低到1％以下。今年就可以争取消灭疟疾。现在，自治州有这所内、外、妇产、小儿等各科俱备的民族医院，自治州各县都有卫生院，区区有卫生所，村村有卫生员和助产员。“瘴气”和帝国主义、军阀官僚、封建领主一起统统从这个地区清扫出去了！各族人民开始过健康、文明和富足的生活。
