Turning Degumming "Waste Liquid" into Dye

When the workers at the Yingshang County Knitting Factory in Anhui Province were washing cotton stalk husks, the splashing water would get on their white aprons and clothes. At first, no one paid any attention; after a few days, these water stains could not be washed off. Although their clothes were stained, they were inspired: "Can the waste liquid from degumming cotton stalks be used to dye clothes?"

In September of this year, the factory began using the waste liquid from degumming cotton stalk husks to dye yarn. After rinsing, the yarn had a very nice flesh color. Later, after dozens of experiments, by adding a small amount of other dyes, they could dye a variety of colors such as camel, reddish brown, coffee, and smoky yellow.

    脱胶“废液”变染料
    安徽省颍上县针织厂的工人在捶洗棉秆皮的时候，溅起的水花沾在白色围裙上和衣服上。起初谁也没有注意；过些日子，这些水渍就怎么也洗不掉了。衣服虽然染污了，他们却得到一个启示：“能不能用棉秆脱胶的废液染衣服呢？”
    今年9月，厂里开始利用棉秆皮脱胶后的废液染纱，经过漂洗后，细纱呈现出很好看的肉色。后来又经过几十次试验，加入少量其它的染料，便可以染出驼色、红棕、咖啡、烟黄等多种颜色。
