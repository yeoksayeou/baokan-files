Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 14th. A statement from the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the situation in Laos was released here today.

The statement, after outlining the facts that Prince Souvanna Phouma formed a government and announced the implementation of a policy of national harmony and peaceful neutrality following the coup in Laos on August 9th of this year, said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is extremely concerned and warmly welcomes the efforts made by the Royal Lao Government to realize its declared foreign policy.

The statement said that US imperialism is seeking every means to create tension in Laos, attempting to turn Laos into its military base. It is doing its utmost to support the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group in establishing a regime alone and is colluding with countries of the Southeast Asian military aggressive bloc to strengthen its interference in Laos. At the same time, US imperialism is also resorting to threats and coercion, attempting to force the Royal Lao Government to abandon its correct path.

The statement pointed out that on November 11, 1960, US imperialism instigated its running dogs to launch a rebellion in Luang Prabang and openly opposed the legitimate government of the Kingdom. On November 12, 1960, the Royal Lao Government announced to the world that it did not recognize the orders issued by the King under duress.

In its statement, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that with regard to the above-mentioned events, it is necessary to reiterate its view that it continues to regard the government headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma as the only legitimate government of Laos, and continues to welcome this government's policy of peace, neutrality and national harmony implemented in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns these conspiracies and actions by US imperialism and the countries that follow the US: interfering in the internal affairs of Laos, creating a situation of division in Laos, obstructing the Lao people and government from following the path of peace, neutrality and national harmony, and threatening the tranquility of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the peace of Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    越南外交部发表声明欢迎老挝政府宣布奉行和平中立政策
    谴责美国干涉老挝内政危害东南亚和平
    新华社河内14日电　此间今天公布越南民主共和国外交部就老挝局势发表的声明。
    声明在概述今年8月9日老挝政变后富马亲王成立了政府并宣布执行民族和睦及和平中立政策等事实之后说，越南民主共和国政府极为关注和热烈欢迎老挝王国政府为了实现其所宣布的外交政策而作的努力。
    声明说，美帝国主义正寻找一切办法来制造老挝紧张局势，企图把老挝变为它的军事基地。它竭力支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团单独建立政权，并拉拢东南亚军事侵略集团国家加强对老挝的干涉。与此同时，美帝国主义还采取威胁、挟逼等手段，企图迫使老挝王国政府放弃自己的正确路线。
    声明指出，1960年11月11日，美帝国主义又嗾使其走狗在琅勃拉邦发动叛乱，并公开反对王国的合法政府。1960年11月12日，老挝王国政府向全世界宣布不承认国王在武力压力下而被迫颁布的命令。
    越南民主共和国政府在声明中认为，对于上述事件，有必要重申自己的观点，即继续认为以梭发那·富马亲王为首相的政府是老挝唯一的合法政府，继续欢迎这个政府按照日内瓦协议精神而实行的和平中立和民族和睦政策。
    越南民主共和国政府强烈谴责美帝国主义和追随美国的国家的这些阴谋和行为：干涉老挝内政，制造老挝分裂局势，阻挠老挝人民和政府遵循和平中立和民族和睦道路，威胁越南民主共和国的安宁及印度支那和东南亚地区的和平。
