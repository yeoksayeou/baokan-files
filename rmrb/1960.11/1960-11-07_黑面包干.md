    Black Bread Crusts
    Bread: Bread to support the German working people!
    As the political crisis in Germany continued to escalate, Lenin called on Russian workers and peasants to concentrate all their efforts on helping the German working people facing severe trials. Even before Vladimir Ilyich had recovered from his injury, he wrote to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the Moscow Soviet, and the joint conference of trade unions, calling on everyone to increase efforts to procure grain, and that if German workers were to find themselves in dire straits because of their struggle for liberation against imperialism, we should stockpile grain in every granary to support them.
    "Let us prove that when the issue concerns not only the Russian revolution, but the international workers' revolution, Russian workers will work even harder, struggle more selflessly, and make more sacrifices," Vladimir Ilyich said in his letter.
    The Russian working class and all the peasants responded to Lenin's call, as they always had!
    The people, ravaged by war, economically devastated, facing famine, armed intervention, and counter-revolutionary rebellion, did not hesitate for a moment, and immediately decided to share their own bread with the German people.
    People all over the country decided to give up a portion of their grain: whether it was disaster-stricken Petrograd, harvestless Kostroma, or ruined Yaroslavl.
    "Our duty, comrades, is to give up the bread that we might have to seize from the rich peasants with rifles, to support the German workers, and if necessary, even increase the burden on the socialist motherland," said a worker from the "Duks" factory at a factory-wide employee meeting.
    "We share our last piece of bread with you, German proletarian brothers," declared the Petrograd Soviet.
    Peasants' carts drove across the Russian plains, thinly covered with the first snow, carrying sacks of grain, with red flags planted on them, marked: these grains are for Lenin to allocate, for Liebknecht to allocate, and to support the world revolution.
    Of course, there were inevitably some people who at the time were called "gossips."
    "We can't even feed ourselves," they grumbled quietly, "we don't have enough to eat, we're almost starving, but the Bolsheviks are giving away the last bit of grain to the Germans!"
    I heard someone say this criticism at a mass meeting at the Shiro factory. But at this moment, an old female worker stepped onto the stage.
    "Sisters, I'm going to say a few words as a mother," she said, "A mother can sometimes go hungry herself, but she must feed her children. And now our Russia is the mother of revolutions in all countries! So, should the Russians only think of their own stomachs and not think of the children in their own family?"
    The granaries were already full of grain and flour, but people were still collecting rye black bread and drying it.
    Black bread crusts, black bread crusts, some two, some three, people held them in their hands and brought them to the Party district committee and the Youth League district committee, and then carefully placed them on the table, not letting a single precious crumb fall.
    These black bread crusts, each one can explain so much. This is a thin square piece, symmetrical, neat, black, and dry. This is a day's ration, a quarter of a catty of bread, cut in half. This is a crust with a semi-circular edge, it was originally the end of a round loaf. People in Moscow don't bake this kind of bread, it was brought by villagers. The person who brought this bread may have clung to the train footboard or squeezed tightly under the iron tarpaulin for several nights. The color of this crust is slightly lighter than the others, this lighter colored bread is supplied on children's ration cards. Who sent it—mother? Or son? Look, this is an oat cake! When buying grain with ration cards, there are two days of bread and one day of oat flour in three days. The collected bread crusts were all wrapped in funnel-shaped paper packets, tied with thin ropes, and placed in cabinets. They must wait there, waiting for the opportunity to come, to be sent to support our foreign brothers.
    ...Bread, the sacred bread that hungry Russians sent to support the German working people, that's what it was like!

    黑面包干
    面包：支援德国劳动人民的面包！
    德国的政治危机正在不断地加剧，当这情形显得突出了以后，列宁就号召俄国工人和农民集中一切力量，帮助面临着艰苦考验的德国劳动人民。弗拉基米尔·伊里奇受伤后还没有复元，就写信给全俄中央执行委员会、莫斯科苏维埃和各工会的联席会议，号召大家增强力量来采购粮食，并且，如果是德国工人由于向帝国主义进行解放斗争而陷入了艰苦的环境的话，那我们就要在每一所谷仓里储备粮食，用来支援他们。
    “让我们证明，当问题涉及的不仅是俄国革命，而是国际工人革命的时候，俄国工人会更有力地工作，会更忘我地进行斗争和作出牺牲，”弗拉基米尔·伊里奇在信里说。
    俄国工人阶级和全体农民，都响应了列宁的号召，就像他们往常一贯响应他的号召那样！
    人民已经受到战争荼毒，遭到经济破坏，面临着饥荒、武装干涉和反革命叛乱，但是这时都毫不犹豫，立刻决定跟德国人民分吃自己的一片面包。
    全国各地的人，都决定把自己的粮食分出一部分来：不论是灾情严重的彼得尔，是没有收成的科斯特罗马，或者是已经沦为废墟的雅罗斯拉夫里。
    “我们的责任，同志们，是分出我们可能要用步枪向富农夺来的那块面包，去支援德国工人，在万不得已的时候，甚至要加重社会主义祖国的负担，”“杜克斯”工厂的一个工人在全厂职工大会上演说。
    “我们和你们分吃最后的一块面包，德国无产阶级弟兄们，”彼得格勒苏维埃宣布。
    农民赶的大车，在薄薄地复着一层初雪的俄罗斯原野上驶过去，车上载着一袋袋谷物，插着一面面红旗，旗上标明：这些谷物是请列宁调配的，请李卜克内西调配的，还有，是支援世界革命的。
    当然，免不了有些当时称之为“说闲话”的人。
    “自己还吃不饱哩，”他们小声地埋怨，“自己还没有吃的哩，都快饿死了，可是布尔什维克反而把最后的一点儿粮食送给德国人！”
    在席罗工厂的一次群众大会上，我听到有人这样非难。但是，就在这时候，一个年老的女工走上了讲台。
    “姊妹们，我现在以一个做母亲的身份来说几句话，”她说，“做母亲的，有时候自己可以不吃饱，但是却要喂饱孩子。而现在我们的俄国是世界各国革命的母亲！那末，俄国人就单想到自己的肚子，不想到自己家里的孩子了吗？”
    谷仓里已经储存了许多谷物和面粉，但是人们还在收集裸麦制的黑面包，把它们烘干了。
    黑面包干，黑面包干，有的两个，有的三个，人们捧着送到党区委会和团区委会里，然后慎重地放在桌子上，不让一点儿宝贵的碎屑儿落下来。
    这些黑面包干，每一个可以说明多少事情啊。这是薄薄的一块方的，匀称、整齐，又黑又干。这是一天的口粮，四分之一斤的面包，切成了两半。这是一个有半圆形边儿的面包干，它原先是一个圆面包的头儿。莫斯科人不烘这样的面包，这是村里人带来的。带这面包来的人，也许好几夜攀在火车踏脚板上面或者紧挤在铁车篷底下。这个面包干的颜色比其他的略淡一些，这种颜色较淡的面包，是凭儿童购粮证供应的。是谁把它送来的——是母亲？还是儿子？再瞧，这是一块燕麦饼！凭购粮证购粮时，三天里有两天是面包，一天是燕麦粉。搜集来的面包干，都包在漏斗形的纸包里，用细绳子捆了，摆在柜子里。它们必须在那里等候着，等机会一到，就送去支援外国的弟兄们。
    ……面包，饥饿的俄国人送去支援德国劳动人民的那些神圣的面包，就是这样的！
