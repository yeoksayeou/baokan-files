Actively and with Leadership Invigorate Rural Market Trade
Abstract of Hubei Daily November 11th Editorial

Rural market trade is a component of the socialist unified market. Under the leadership of state-owned commerce, it assists state-owned commerce in better meeting the reasonable needs of the people's production and life and invigorating the rural economy. All localities should actively and with leadership develop rural market trade.

State-owned commerce is the main part of the socialist market and the leading force of the market. There is no doubt that the future purchasing and marketing tasks should still mainly rely on state-owned commerce. However, we cannot therefore ignore the positive role of market trade in invigorating the rural economy. With the continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the continuous increase in social purchasing power, the demand of urban and rural people for daily necessities is also increasing day by day; moreover, this demand is very complex, requiring a wide variety of commodities. How to adapt to this requirement of production development and improvement of life? The method is "walking on two legs." In addition to continuing to strengthen direct procurement and supply work, state-owned commercial departments should also strengthen the organization and leadership of rural market trade work in order to better play the auxiliary role of rural market trade. Developing market trade can more widely organize the masses to sell commodities, enrich sources of goods, and increase commodity varieties; it can more fully utilize the role of various folk transportation forces in the process of commodity collection, distribution, and transportation to supplement the inadequacy of national transportation forces. In this way, it is convenient for people's communes, production teams, production groups, and commune members to exchange and adjust some commodities, further invigorate the rural economy, and better communicate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and it is also convenient for state-owned commercial departments to open up sources of goods. At the same time, since market trade is carried out with leadership and organization, it is also convenient for the state to manage the market.

Socialist trade is closely related to production. Only with more production can trade be active, this is one aspect; on the other hand, conscientiously implementing the state's various trade policies, organizing market trade well, and further invigorating the rural economy are conducive to better mobilizing the production enthusiasm of commune members and promoting the development of production.

The key to further invigorating rural market trade with leadership and planning lies in implementing the state's various trade policies and various policies for developing production. Except for grain, cotton, oil and other materials subject to state monopoly purchase and marketing, which are not allowed to be bought and sold in the market, other agricultural and sideline products, all surplus products of people's communes, production teams, and production groups after completing the state-prescribed sales tasks, can be brought to the market for trading; sideline food products, small local and special products, and household sideline products produced by members of people's communes and other individuals, except for certain materials (such as fat pigs) that must complete the state-prescribed sales tasks, can also be traded in the market. In addition to conscientiously implementing the state's various trade policies, it is also necessary to strictly implement the various policies of the people's communes. Only in this way can we develop production faster and organize market trade well.

To do a good job in market trade, we must strengthen leadership and management. The development of market trade does not reduce the state-owned commerce's responsibility for leading the market, but rather increases its leadership responsibility. State-owned commerce must better exert its leading role through the management of the market. The "Instructions on Organizing Rural Market Trade" issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on September 23, 1959, pointed out: "The principle of leading and organizing rural market trade should be to be lively but not chaotic, and to manage but not rigidly." In order to correctly implement this principle, it is necessary to carry out political and ideological education and propaganda work on economic policies among cadres and the masses. In addition to publicizing the benefits of developing market trade and various policies to ensure legitimate trade, and mobilizing everyone to actively participate in market trade, it is also necessary to educate everyone to be fair and reasonable in participating in market trade, only sell goods they produce themselves, only buy back goods they need, not engage in reselling to make money, not raise prices, not rush to buy, and not abandon agriculture for commerce; educate everyone to correctly treat the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, not buy or sell materials subject to state monopoly purchase and marketing in the market, first ensure the completion of the task of selling to the state, and individuals and families should actively engage in production under the principle of not hindering collective production. In addition to political and ideological and economic policy propaganda and education work, it is also necessary to strengthen the management of the market. The commercial, banking, taxation and other relevant departments at the commune level and the responsible cadres of the production teams where the market is located, under the unified leadership of the commune party committee, jointly organize the market management committee, which is very necessary to strengthen the management of the market. The task of the market management committee is to be responsible for implementing state policies and market management methods, ensuring legitimate trade, guiding market transactions; leading the exchange and service department; banning all illegal activities in the market, and handling various problems occurring in the market. Under the leadership and organization of the market management committee, adopt various forms to further invigorate rural market trade. For example, according to local historical customs, combined with commune members' fixed holidays or festivals, organize regular market trade and canteen markets, hold material exchange meetings of three categories with leadership, and establish and rectify exchanges, etc.

In order to effectively strengthen the leadership of rural market trade, party organizations at all levels in rural areas, especially commune party committees, should strengthen unified leadership over this work, select strong cadres to participate in the work of the market management committee and the exchange, and treat the development of rural market trade as a major event and handle it well.

    积极地有领导地活跃农村集市贸易
    湖北日报十一月十一日社论摘要
    农村集市市场，是社会主义统一市场的组成部分，它在国营商业的领导下，辅助国营商业更好地满足人民生产和生活的合理需要，活跃农村经济。各地都应该积极地有领导地开展农村集市贸易。
    国营商业是社会主义市场的主要部分，是市场的领导力量。今后的购销任务，仍然应该主要依靠国营商业来担当，这是毫无疑问的。但是，不能因此就忽视集市贸易在活跃农村经济方面的积极作用。随着工农业生产的不断跃进和社会购买力的不断提高，城乡人民对日用生活品的需求也日益增长；而且，这种需求又十分复杂，要求的商品多种多样。如何来适应生产发展和生活提高的这种要求呢？办法是“两条腿走路”。国营商业部门除了继续加强直接的收购和供应工作外，还要加强组织、领导农村集市贸易工作，以便更好地发挥农村集市贸易的辅助作用。开展集市贸易，就可以更广泛地组织群众出售商品，充实货源，增加商品品种；就可以在商品的集散运输过程中，更充分地发挥各种民间运输力量的作用，以补国家运输力量之不足。这样，既便于人民公社、生产队、生产小队和社员之间进行部分商品的交换和调剂，进一步活跃农村经济，更好地沟通城乡物资交流，又便于为国营商业部门开辟货源。同时，由于集市贸易是有领导有组织地开展的，它又便于国家管理市场。
    社会主义的贸易和生产有着密切联系。只有生产得多，贸易才能活跃，这是一方面；另一方面，认真贯彻执行国家的各项贸易政策，组织好集市贸易，进一步活跃农村经济，又有利于更好地调动公社社员的生产积极性，促进生产的发展。
    有领导地有计划地进一步活跃农村集市贸易的关键，在于贯彻执行国家的各项贸易政策，以及发展生产的各项政策。除国家统购统销的粮食、棉花、油料等物资不得在集市市场上买卖外，其他农副产品，凡是人民公社、生产队、生产小队在完成国家规定的交售任务以外的剩余产品，都可以拿到集市市场上进行交易；人民公社社员和其他个人生产的副食品、小土特产品、家庭副业产品等，除某些物资（如肥猪）要完成国家规定的交售任务外，也都可以在集市市场上进行交易。除了认真贯彻执行国家的各项贸易政策以外，还要严格执行人民公社的各项政策。只有这样，才能更快地发展生产，组织好集市贸易。
    要搞好集市贸易，必须加强领导，加强管理。集市贸易的开展，对国营商业来说，不是减轻了自己对市场的领导的责任，而是更加重了自己的领导责任。国营商业要通过对集市市场的管理，来更好地发挥自己的领导作用。1959年9月23日，中共中央和国务院颁布的关于组织农村集市贸易的指示中指出：“领导和组织农村集市贸易的原则，应当是活而不乱、管而不死。”为了正确贯彻执行这一原则，就必须在干部和群众中进行政治思想教育工作和经济政策的宣传工作。除了宣传开展集市贸易的好处和保障合法贸易的各项政策，动员大家积极参加集市贸易外，还要教育大家在参加集市贸易中，作到买卖公平合理，只出卖自己生产的商品，只买回自己需要的商品，不作转手买卖、从中赚钱，不抬价、不抢购，不弃农经商；教育大家正确对待国家、集体和个人三者间的关系，不在集市市场上买卖国家统购统销的物资，首先保证完成向国家交售的任务，个人和家庭的生产要在不妨碍集体生产的原则下积极经营。除了政治思想和经济政策的宣传教育工作外，还必须加强对集市市场的管理工作。公社一级的商业、银行、税务等有关部门和集市所在地的生产队的负责干部，在公社党委的统一领导下，共同组织市场管理委员会，对加强集市市场管理是十分必要的。市场管理委员会的任务，是负责执行国家政策和市场管理办法，保障合法贸易，指导市场交易；领导交易所和服务部； 取缔市场上的一切违法活动，处理市场上发生的各种问题。在市场管理委员会的领导和组织下，采取多种多样的形式，来进一步活跃农村集市贸易。例如，根据当地的历史习惯，结合社员的固定假日或者节日，组织定期的集市贸易和食堂集市，有领导地召开三类物资交流会，建立和整顿交易所等。
    为了能切实加强农村集市贸易的领导，农村各级党组织，特别是公社党委，要加强对这一工作的统一领导，选派强有力的干部参加市场管理委员会和交易所的工作，把开展农村集市贸易当成一件大事来办，一定办好。
