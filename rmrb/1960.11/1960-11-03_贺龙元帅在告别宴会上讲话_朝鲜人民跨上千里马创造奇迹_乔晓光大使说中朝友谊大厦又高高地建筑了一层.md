Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd: Marshal He Long, head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission of China, and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a speech at the farewell banquet held in Pyongyang tonight, the full text of which is as follows: Respected Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung, Respected Comrade General Kim Kwang-hyup, Dear Comrades and Friends:

Our friendly visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has lasted for more than ten days. During this period, we were honored to be received by the leaders of the Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, and the Korean People's Army, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung; participated in the grand commemorative activities held by the people of Pyongyang for the tenth anniversary of "October 25th"; visited cities such as Pyongyang, Kaesong, Songrim, and Heechon; and had cordial and enthusiastic meetings with the broad masses of Korean workers and peasants, and with our close comrades-in-arms, the comrades of the Korean People's Army; we also enjoyed your artistic performances with a long national tradition and a strong fighting spirit. Thanks to the meticulous care of the Korean Party and government, especially Comrade Kim Il-sung himself and Comrade Kim Kwang-hyup, we had a very pleasant, very satisfactory, and very rewarding visit. The warm welcome and grand reception given to us by the Korean people and the comrades of the People's Army deeply moved me, Comrade Luo Ruiqing, and all the members of the delegation. We believe that this is not only an expression of sincere friendship towards our delegation, but also an expression of the great friendship of the entire Korean people towards the entire Chinese people. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks and high respect to the respected Comrade Kim Il-sung and the leading comrades of the Korean Workers' Party, government, and army, to all the Korean comrades who have warmly received us, and through you, to the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army.

In these exciting days, the heroic image of the Korean people has left an indelible impression on us. Everywhere we can see that the Korean people have shown high political enthusiasm, soaring fighting spirit, and joyful emotions in the labor of building socialism. After the Korean armistice, the victorious Korean people rebuilt their motherland and homes almost on a pile of ruins. I once led a Chinese people's delegation to Korea for condolences shortly after the Korean armistice in 1953. Compared with that time, the face of northern Korea today has undergone fundamental changes, the serious wounds left by the war have been eliminated, and the socialist economic foundation has been firmly established. We saw a moving microcosm of the rapid development of Korean agriculture in the Korea-China Friendship Cooperative. Everywhere we saw large-scale, new-equipped, and highly efficient factories spring up like mushrooms after rain. We saw that many cities that had been bombed into rubble by American aerial bandits had become more magnificent and more beautiful than before, just like the heroic city of Pyongyang. The Korean people have created mythical miracles with the heroic spirit of riding on the Chollima. At present, the Korean people are confidently preparing to implement the even more ambitious Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. Your high-speed development on the economic construction front and the ever-increasing improvement of the people's living standards fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, and shattered the evil American imperialists' wishful thinking that they could use a large number of bombs, shells, and napalm bombs to put the Korean people in a state of "eternal doom." The great achievements created by the Korean people under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung will shine with the sun and the moon and last forever.

During our visit, we were also pleased to see that the fraternal Korean People's Army has achieved exciting achievements in the cause of army building and in improving military, political, and cultural qualities. The People's Army has many valuable experiences that are worth our humble study. The Korean People's Army, with its glorious fighting tradition, is tirelessly and vigilantly guarding the easternmost front of the socialist camp day and night, making and continuing to make significant contributions to maintaining the Korean armistice and defending world peace. We are sincerely delighted with the glorious achievements of the Korean People's Army and extend our fraternal congratulations.

Dear Comrades and Friends: We are facing a great situation in which the East wind has prevailed over the West wind and will continue to prevail over the West wind. The future of our two peoples' common cause of defending peace and building socialism is infinitely bright. One of the fundamental guarantees for the success of our cause is the unbreakable unity and close friendship that has been established between us and between us and all socialist countries. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples has a long history. After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, after the invincible Marxism-Leninism was spread to both countries and accepted by the outstanding sons and daughters of both countries, this friendship developed into a completely new historical period. Since then, the working people of the two countries have always supported, helped, and learned from each other in the struggle against international imperialism and domestic reactionary rule, in the struggle to build their own motherlands, in the struggle to uphold the principles of Marxism-Leninism and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and in the struggle against the aggression and war policies of American imperialism and to defend peace. In the first and second domestic revolutionary wars in our country, on the battlefields of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and on the battlefields of the Korean War of National Liberation, the blood of the soldiers of China and Korea has flowed together. We have always firmly believed that the solid unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples, forged with blood and based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, cannot be destroyed by any force. The Chinese people and the army must always unite with the fraternal Korean people and the army under any circumstances, and jointly strive to achieve our great goals—the lofty ideals of socialism and communism!

I propose: For the eternal friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Korea,
For the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
For the health of the leading comrades of the Korean Workers' Party and government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung,
For the health of Comrade Kim Kwang-hyup and all comrades of the Korean People's Army,
For world peace,
Cheers.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd: Chinese Ambassador to Korea Qiao Xiaoguang delivered a speech at the farewell banquet held in Pyongyang tonight by the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, the full text of which is as follows: Respected Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung: Respected Comrade Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Kim Kwang-hyup: Dear Comrades and Friends:

During the visit of our country's military friendship delegation led by Marshal He Long and General Luo Ruiqing to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, they received a very kind, warm, and meticulous reception and care from the leading comrades of the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, the People's Army, and the broad masses of the Korean people, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, thus making this visit of our country's military friendship delegation to Korea a great success. For this, I would like to express my highest respect and heartfelt thanks to the respected Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung! To the leading comrades of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, the Government of the Republic and the People's Army, to the heroic Korean workers and farmers, to the Korean artists with combat and beautiful art, to the Korean people and volunteer mothers who assisted and rescued the volunteers, to all Korean friends and comrades who warmly received our military friendship delegation, I express my heartfelt thanks and highest respect!

Between the Chinese and Korean peoples and the armies of the two countries, on the common ideological basis of Marxism-Leninism, in the long-term common struggle against imperialism, a fraternal and unbreakable fighting friendship has been forged. This friendship is like a solid tall building, which is being built higher and higher through mutual visits between the leaders of our two countries and mutual assistance and cooperation in various aspects. The success of this visit of our country's military friendship delegation to Korea and the grand, cordial, and warm reception it received shows that the edifice of friendship between the peoples of our two countries has been built higher. This has made new and significant contributions to strengthening the common struggle of our two peoples against American imperialism, to accelerating the socialist construction of our two countries and firmly defending socialist construction, to defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, to enhancing the unity and power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Dear Comrades and Friends! Allow me to propose:

For the everlasting fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples and the armies of the two countries,
For the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
For the good health of Comrade Premier Kim Il-sung,
For the health of the leading comrades of the Korean Workers' Party, the Government of the Republic, and the People's Army,
For the good health of the Korean artists, Chollima riders, and volunteer mothers,
For the good health of the ambassadors and charges d'affaires of various countries stationed in Korea and their wives,
For the good health of all comrades and friends present here,
For world peace,
Cheers!

    贺龙元帅在告别宴会上讲话
    朝鲜人民跨上千里马创造奇迹
    乔晓光大使说中朝友谊大厦又高高地建筑了一层
    新华社平壤2日电　中国访朝军事友好代表团团长、中国国防委员会副主席、国务院副总理贺龙元帅，今天晚上在平壤举行的告别宴会上的讲话，全文如下：敬爱的金日成首相同志，敬爱的金光侠大将同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行的友好访问，已经十多天了。在这个期间内，我们荣幸地受到了以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府和人民军领导同志的接见；参加了平壤市人民为“十·二五”十周年举行的盛大的纪念活动；访问了平壤、开城、松林和熙川等城市，同广大的朝鲜工人、农民弟兄们，同我们的亲密战友朝鲜人民军的同志们进行了亲切热情的会见；欣赏了你们具有悠久民族传统的和强烈战斗气息的艺术表演。由于朝鲜党和政府、特别是金日成同志本人和金光侠同志无微不至的关怀，使我们进行了一次非常愉快、非常满意而又获益甚多的访问。朝鲜人民和人民军战友们对我们的热烈欢迎和隆重接待，使我和罗瑞卿同志以及代表团的全体成员，都深为感动。我们认为，这不仅是对我们代表团的真诚友好的表现，而且也是全体朝鲜人民对全体中国人民的伟大的友谊表现。我愿借此机会，向敬爱的金日成同志和朝鲜劳动党、政府及军队的领导同志们，向所有盛情接待我们的朝鲜同志们，并通过你们向英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军表示衷心的感谢和崇高的敬意。
    在这些令人激动的日子里，朝鲜人民的英雄形象，给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。我们到处可以看到，朝鲜人民在建设社会主义的劳动中，表现了高度的政治热情、昂扬的斗志和欢乐的情绪。朝鲜停战以后，胜利了的朝鲜人民，几乎是在一片废墟上重建了自己的祖国和家园。1953年朝鲜停战不久，我曾经率领中国人民赴朝慰问团来过朝鲜。同那时相比，今天朝鲜北部的面貌，已经发生了根本的变化，战争遗留下来的严重创伤已经消除，社会主义的经济基础已经巩固地建立起来。我们在朝中友谊合作社看到了朝鲜农业飞快发展的一幅动人的缩影。我们在各地看到了一座座规模大、设备新、效率高的工厂，如雨后春笋一般地建立起来。我们看到许多曾经被美国空中强盗轰炸成一片瓦砾的城市，都同英雄的城市平壤一样变得比以前更宏伟、更美丽了。朝鲜人民以跨上千里马的英雄气概，创造出了神话般的奇迹。目前，朝鲜人民又在信心百倍地准备执行规模更加宏大的人民经济发展七年计划。你们在经济建设战线上的高速度发展，人民生活水平的日益提高，充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性，打破了万恶的美帝国主义以为凭借大量炸弹、炮弹和凝固汽油弹就可以把朝鲜人民置于“万劫不复”之地的妄想。朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的正确领导下所创造的丰功伟绩，将与日月争辉，万古流芳。
    我们在访问中还高兴地看到了，兄弟的朝鲜人民军在军队建设事业上，在提高军事、政治和文化素质等方面，都获得了令人兴奋的成就。人民军有许多宝贵的经验，值得我们虚心地学习。有着光荣战斗传统的朝鲜人民军，正在日夜不懈地警惕地守卫社会主义阵营东方的最前线，为维护朝鲜停战和保卫世界和平，作出了并在继续作出重大的贡献。我们为朝鲜人民军所取得的光辉成就感到由衷的喜悦，并致以兄弟的祝贺。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们：我们正面临着东风已经压倒西风，并将继续压倒西风的大好形势。我们两国人民保卫和平、建设社会主义的共同事业的前途，是无限光明的。我们的事业必获胜利的根本保障之一，是由于在我们之间、在我们同社会主义各国之间建立了牢不可破的团结和亲密的友谊。中朝两国人民之间的友谊是渊源久长的。在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利之后，在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义传播到两国、并被两国的优秀儿女们接受之后，这种友谊就发展到了一个全新的历史时期。从此，两国劳动人民在反对国际帝国主义和国内反动统治的斗争中，在建设自己祖国的斗争中，在维护马克思列宁主义原则、加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结的斗争中，在反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策、保卫和平的斗争中，一向是互相支援、互相帮助、互相学习的。在我国第一次和第二次国内革命战争中，在抗日战争和解放战争的战场上，在朝鲜祖国解放战争的战场上，朝中两国战士们的鲜血曾经流在一起，我们始终坚定不移地相信：用鲜血凝成的、建立在无产阶级国际主义基础上的朝中两国人民间的巩固团结，是任何力量都不能破坏的。中国人民和军队，无论在任何情况下，都一定要同兄弟的朝鲜人民和军队永远地团结在一起，为实现我们的伟大目标——社会主义和共产主义的崇高理想而共同奋斗！
    我提议：为中朝两国人民和军队之间的永恒友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，
    为以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和政府领导同志的健康，
    为金光侠同志和朝鲜人民军全体同志的健康，
    为世界和平，
    干杯。
