    In Bulgaria
    Li Ji
        A Worker in a Rose Village
    Where do I leave half my heart?
    In a rose village at the foot of the Balkan Mountains.
    Who makes me remember you often?
    A worker from Aloch'ao.
    Growing up in a mountain village planting roses,
    I had never seen a Chinese person before.
    Upon meeting, we shook hands and wouldn't let go,
    Looking at loved ones through teary eyes.
    Offering a bottle of rose water,
    Heart warm, stuttering, with earnest affection.
    The fragrance of roses is most fragrant,
    The affection is deeper than the ten-thousand-zhang Black Sea.
    "Since the time I learned about China,
    She has taken root in my heart;
    If you want me to forget her,
    Unless you dig out this heart!"
        The Female Workers of the Burgas Cable Factory
    On the beautiful Black Sea coast,
    I saw a group of girls.
    Faces like May roses,
    A pair of hands,
    Like two magical wands.
    Endless wires instantly become cables,
    Like silkworms spinning silk thousands and thousands of feet.
    Silkworms have a time when they finish spinning,
    Cables, ah,
    Like endless flowing water, long and continuous.
    Silk is woven into beautiful brocade,
    Cables are like spider webs densely covering the earth.
    Endless cables are thousands of blood vessels,
    In the blood vessels,
    Transmitting light, happiness, and strength.
    On the beautiful Black Sea coast,
    There is a cable factory.
    Here are produced the bonds connecting happiness,
    The masters,
    Are a group of rose-like girls.
        The Rose of Kazanlak
    The roses of Kazanlak are the most fragrant,
    The girls of Kazanlak are the most beautiful.
    Enthusiastic hosts fill rose brandy,
    Wanting to toast the fraternal Chinese people.
    Even though I don't have the capacity for an ocean of wine,
    I cannot help but raise my glass;
    The fragrant and rich wine has not yet touched my lips,
    The moving deep affection has already intoxicated me.

    在保加利亚
    李季
        玫瑰村一工人
    何处留我半边心？
    巴尔干山下玫瑰村。
    什么人使我常相记？
    阿洛希堖一工人。
    生长山村种玫瑰，
    从来没有见过中国人。
    相见握手不放手，
    透过泪眼看亲人。
    捧出一瓶玫瑰水，
    心热口吃情殷殷。
    玫瑰花香最芬芳，
    情赛黑海万丈深。
    “自从知道中国时，
    她就在我心里生了根；
    若是让我忘了她，
    除非挖掉这颗心！”
        布加斯电缆厂的女工们
    在美丽的黑海边上，
    我看见一群姑娘。
    脸儿像五月的玫瑰，
    一双手，
    像两只神奇的魔杖。
    不尽的导线转眼变成电缆，
    就像春蚕吐丝千丈万丈。
    蚕丝有吐尽的时候，
    电缆呵，
    像不尽的流水源远流长。
    蚕丝织成美丽的锦缎，
    电缆像密布在大地上的蜘蛛网。
    不尽的电缆是千万条血管，
    血管里，
    传送着光明、幸福和力量。
    在美丽的黑海边上，
    有一个电缆工厂。
    这里生产着连接幸福的纽带，
    主人们，
    是一群玫瑰花似的姑娘。
        喀山烈克的玫瑰
    喀山烈克的玫瑰最香，
    喀山烈克的姑娘最美。
    热情的主人斟满玫瑰烧酒，
    要为兄弟的中国人民干杯。
    纵然我没有海样的酒量，
    却也不自禁地举起酒杯；
    芳香浓郁的美酒还未沾唇，
    感人的深情却已使我沉醉。
