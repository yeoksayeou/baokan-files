    Jiguang Middle School Deeply Develops Scientific and Technological Activities

    (Report from this newspaper) Under the ideological guidance of comprehensively implementing the Party's educational policy, Jiguang Middle School in Shanghai has extensively, deeply, and persistently carried out scientific and technological activities for young people. This has not only improved the quality of learning, but also enabled students to receive ideological education through scientific and technological activities, establishing lofty ambitions to strive for self-improvement and dare to climb the peaks of science.

    Since the beginning of this semester, the school has first held special scientific lectures on agricultural planting and breeding, and then organized students to widely conduct various activities such as planting, breeding, trial-producing indigenous pesticides, indigenous fertilizers, increasing the egg-laying rate of artificial incubation, and breeding and raising poultry. Through these activities, students not only increased their scientific and technological knowledge, but also gradually cultivated a love for agriculture. In this support for "Three Autumns" labor in the countryside, the students applied the research results of scientific and technological activities to actively serve agriculture. For example, the first and second-year students who supported the "Three Autumns" labor in the Gusong People's Commune in Songjiang used linear programming during their labor, which not only accelerated the speed of rice harvesting but also saved labor. Cai Yafang, a first-year student, studied the breeding and raising of pigs. She personally delivered twenty-three piglets at the school's breeding farm. Now she has gradually developed feelings for raising pigs. She said: "If the Party needs me, I am willing to go to the countryside to be a breeder for life."

    Because the school pays attention to conducting education on increasing production and practicing economy in scientific and technological activities, students have carried forward the "poor man's" spirit in these activities. In terms of equipment for scientific and technological activities, they strive to be simple and crude, and use substitutes and break things down into smaller parts to save raw materials. The entire school implements the spirit of "spending less money and doing more things" in scientific and technological activities, cultivating students' spirit of hard work and plain living.

    Jiguang Middle School also pays attention to closely integrating scientific and technological activities with teaching, labor, national defense, and sports. The school incorporates scientific and technological activities into the teaching plan, establishes a regular system, and arranges two to three sessions per week for scientific and technological activities. Teachers of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology propose scientific and technological projects based on the teaching content and guide students to consolidate their knowledge through the practice of scientific and technological activities. For example, the physics teacher compiled the "lighting route" data from the electrician group's activities into teaching materials for third-year students, so that students can not only learn how to install but also firmly grasp theoretical knowledge.

    At present, Jiguang Middle School continues to follow the direction indicated by the Party's educational policy, more comprehensively planning the school's scientific and technological activities, so as to make the activities more widespread and deeper, and to train more and better technical reserve forces who are both red and expert for the country.

    继光中学深入开展科学技术活动
    本报讯　上海市继光中学在全面贯彻党的教育方针的思想指导下，广泛、深入、持久地开展青少年科学技术活动，不仅提高了学习质量，并且使学生通过科学技术活动受到了思想教育，树立了发愤图强敢于攀登科学高峰的雄心壮志。
    本学期开学以来，学校首先举办了有关农业种植、饲养的专题科学讲座，随后组织学生广泛地进行各种种植、饲养和试制土农药、土化肥、提高人工孵蛋出蛋率、家禽繁殖饲养等活动。通过这些活动，学生们不仅增加了科学技术知识，而且逐渐培养起爱农业的思想。在这次下乡支援“三秋”劳动中，学生们就应用科学技术活动的研究成果，积极为农业服务。如支援松江古松人民公社“三秋”劳动的高一、高二学生，在劳动中运用线性规划，既加速了割稻的速度，又节约了劳动力。高一学生蔡亚芳，研究猪的繁殖和饲养问题，她在学校的饲养场里亲自接生了二十三头小猪。现在她对养猪逐渐建立了感情。她表示：“如果党需要，我愿意到农村中去终身当一个饲养员。”
    由于学校在科学技术活动中注意进行增产节约的教育，学生在这些活动中都发扬了“穷棒子”精神。在科学技术活动的设备上，力求因陋就简，并以代用品、化整为零的办法来节省原材料。整个学校在科学技术活动中贯彻“少花钱多做事”的精神，培养了学生的艰苦朴素的作风。
    继光中学还注意把科学技术活动和教学、劳动、国防、体育等紧密结合起来。学校把科学技术活动纳入教学计划，建立经常的制度，每周安排二到三节时间，进行科学技术活动。数、理、化、生物等学科的教师根据教学内容，提出科学技术项目，指导学生通过科学技术活动的实践，巩固所学的知识。如物理教师将电工小组开展活动的“照明路线”资料整理后编成教材，对初三学生进行讲解，使学生既学会安装，又能牢靠地掌握理论知识。
    目前，继光中学继续沿着党的教育方针所指示的方向，更全面地规划全校的科学技术活动，以便使活动开展得更广泛、更深入，为国家培养更多更好的又红又专的技术后备力量。
