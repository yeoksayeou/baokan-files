　　Each Person Plants Another Fen of Vegetables
　　While harvesting and storing autumn vegetables well, our commune launched a campaign for each person to plant another fen of winter vegetables. Our commune is a mountainous area with a lot of land that can be used to grow winter vegetables. Because we didn't have the habit of planting winter vegetables in the past, this land could not be fully utilized. This year, the Party committee analyzed our local climate, soil and other conditions, and believed that winter vegetables could be planted in large quantities. The members of the production teams launched a debate on the issue of large-scale winter vegetable planting, and proposed that there are more than 10,000 mu of land and more than 30 kinds of vegetables in the whole commune that can be sown in winter.
　　In the process of planting winter vegetables, the commune Party committee helped the major brigades solve difficult problems such as planting technology and seeds. The commune also helped the major brigades to do experiments on vegetables going up the mountains and the northward movement of northern vegetables to the south. Now the whole commune has planted more than 3,000 mu of winter vegetables, including six new varieties that have not been planted here in the past, such as Hebei Dabao cabbage, Hunan cabbage, and Jiangsu Zhuyeqing.

    每人再种一分菜
    我们公社在收好、藏好秋菜的同时，开展了每人再种一分冬菜的运动。我们公社是个山区，有很多可以利用种冬菜的田地，由于过去没有种冬菜的习惯，使这些土地不能充分利用。今年，党委分析了我们这里的气候和土质等条件，认为完全可以大量种植冬菜，各生产队的社员为大种冬菜的问题开展了鸣放辩论，提出全社有一万多亩土地和三十多样蔬菜品种可以在冬季播种。
    在种冬菜的过程中，公社党委帮助各大队解决了种植技术、种子等困难问题。公社还帮助各大队做了蔬菜上山和北菜南移的试验。现在全公社已种冬菜三千多亩，其中有过去这里没有种过的河北大包头菜、湖南白菜、江苏竹叶青等六个新品种。
