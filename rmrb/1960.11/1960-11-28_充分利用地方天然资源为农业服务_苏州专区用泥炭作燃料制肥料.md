Fully Utilize Local Natural Resources to Serve Agriculture
    Suzhou Prefecture Uses Peat as Fuel to Make Fertilizer

    (Our newspaper, Nanjing, 27th dispatch) Many people's communes and factories and enterprises in Suzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are actively utilizing peat as fuel to make fertilizer, produce chemical raw materials, and use it as pig feed.

    The Suzhou area has abundant peat reserves and a wide distribution. In order to fully utilize this local natural resource with considerable economic value, in the first half of this year, each county in Suzhou Prefecture organized leading groups headed by the county party committee's industrial minister or finance and trade minister to ascertain the distribution of resources and formulate plans for exploitation and comprehensive utilization. People's communes with peat resources would exploit more during the agricultural slack season and less during the busy season, and actively exploit peat in conjunction with land reclamation and water conservancy projects. Many people's communes and factories and enterprises are vigorously promoting the comprehensive utilization of peat. At present, not only are canteens and bathhouses using peat as fuel, but industrial departments are also using peat extensively for boilers and brick kilns. Nearly half of the furnaces, stoves, and kilns in the machinery, chemical, and brick industries in Wujiang County are mixed with peat, and some even burn peat entirely.

    Suzhou Prefecture has created and promoted many good methods for using peat as fertilizer. For example, peat is dry-distilled to extract ammonia water, and ammonium sulfate is manufactured using indigenous methods. The equipment is simple, and the operation is easy. The residue after extracting ammonia water is still a quick-acting fertilizer containing phosphorus and potassium, and it can be directly applied to the fields after being crushed, making the stems of crops strong and preventing them from lodging. More than 38,000 dry distillation furnaces have been built throughout the prefecture. Peat mixed with caustic soda can be used to refine sodium humate and potassium humate. Since the beginning of this year, the entire prefecture has produced 46.49 million catties of sodium humate. Peat is also used extensively to manufacture bacterial fertilizers. Using peat as fertilizer is effective and inexpensive, and it is welcomed by the broad masses of farmers.

    Because peat contains undecomposed protein and hemicellulose, some communes have successfully used peat as pig feed. Peat can also be refined into oil. The Zhenze Chemical Plant uses dry peat to refine oil, with an oil yield of 3.3%. The crude oil is then fractionated into gasoline, kerosene, light diesel, heavy diesel, paraffin, asphalt, phenol, and other chemical raw materials.

### 充分利用地方天然资源为农业服务  苏州专区用泥炭作燃料制肥料

    充分利用地方天然资源为农业服务
    苏州专区用泥炭作燃料制肥料
    本报南京27日电　江苏省苏州专区许多人民公社和工厂企业积极利用泥炭作燃料，制肥料，造化工原料，作猪饲料。
    苏州地区泥炭藏量丰富，分布面广。为了充分利用这种有不小经济价值的地方天然资源，今年上半年，苏州专区各县都以县委工业部长或财贸部长为首组织了领导小组，摸清资源分布情况，制订开采和综合利用的规划。有泥炭的人民公社农闲多搞，农忙少搞，并结合开荒、修水利等积极开采泥炭。许多人民公社和工厂企业大搞泥炭的综合利用。目前不仅食堂、浴室用泥炭作燃料，工业部门烧锅炉、烧砖瓦等也已大量使用泥炭。吴江县的机械、化工、砖瓦等行业，已有近二分之一的炉、灶、窑掺用泥炭，有的还全部烧泥炭。
    苏州专区已经创造和推行了许多用泥炭做肥料的好办法。如把泥炭干馏，提取氨水，用土办法制造硫酸铵，设备简单，操作容易。提取氨水后的残渣还是含有磷钾的速效肥，粉碎以后可以直接下田，使庄稼茎秆坚实，不易倒伏。全专区已建干馏炉三万八千多只。泥炭和烧碱等混合，可以炼制胡敏酸钠、胡敏酸钾。今年以来，全专区已生产胡敏酸钠四千六百四十九万斤。泥炭还大量用来制造细菌肥料。用泥炭做肥料，效果好，花钱少，受到广大农民的欢迎。
    由于泥炭中含有没有分解的蛋白质和半纤维素，有些公社已把泥炭成功地用作猪饲料。泥炭也可以炼油。震泽化工厂利用干泥炭炼油，出油率达3.3％。原油又分馏出汽油、煤油、轻柴油、重柴油、石蜡、沥青、酚和其它化工原料。
