    Stalin City's Labor Emulation
    Stalin City, nestled in the Carpathian Mountains, is a machinery manufacturing center in Romania with well-developed textile and food industries. Romania's first tractors and trucks were produced here. In the nationwide socialist labor emulation, tens of thousands of workers in Stalin City stand at the forefront of the movement. This year, many important initiatives have spread from here to all parts of the country, setting a clear banner for the labor emulation movement.
    The initiative of saving every millimeter of metal, proposed by the Stalin City Lathe Factory, has been echoed by metal processing workers across the country. After studying the production process of machine parts, the workers and engineers of this factory believed that the blank weights of many parts exceeded actual needs, wasting a lot of metal during processing. Therefore, they proposed the initiative of reducing blanks and saving every millimeter of metal. This year, the factory has saved more than eighty tons of various metals.
      "Save enough material for two days' use every month" – this is the initiative proposed by the forging workshop of the "Ernst Thälmann" Tractor Factory. Many production industries across the country have already taken action according to this initiative. So far, this workshop has saved more than one hundred and fifty tons of metal.
    The practice of conducting competitions among workers in the same profession also started in Stalin City and has now been widely promoted throughout the country. The slogan of this professional competition is to strive to become the best worker in the profession, such as "the best fitter," "the best turner," and so on. More than nine thousand workers in Stalin City are now participating in this competition.
    Factories and workshops in Stalin City have established institutions to lead the technical innovation movement, such as "Technical Innovation Committees," "Technical Innovation Teams," "Technical Groups," and so on. More and more workers are participating in this movement this year. So far, there are more than two thousand six hundred innovators in the city, who have put forward more than three thousand innovation proposals. The "Ernst Thälmann" Tractor Factory, which has won the Red Banner of Production eighteen times, produced eleven thousand tractors last year. This year, the state's task for the factory is to produce sixteen thousand units, while the workers guarantee to produce seventeen thousand units. The central issue in realizing this guarantee is to carry out the technical innovation movement. In the "Ernst Thälmann" Tractor Factory, one in every four workers is an innovator, and the factory has put forward more than eight hundred innovation proposals this year. Lauzolia, a recipient of the "First-Class Labor Medal," suggested using aluminum instead of pig iron and welding instead of riveting when manufacturing heat sinks. In this way, each heat sink can save twenty-two kilograms of metal, saving more than three hundred tons of metal annually, and also increase the cooling effect by 30%. His recent innovation is to mechanize the work of the small iron supports used in sand casting, increasing the labor efficiency of this work by more than twenty times.
    In the factories and enterprises of Stalin City, there are many examples of advanced workers leading backward production teams and workers helping each other. A popular slogan here is: "There must be no laggards around you." Professional production competitions in various factories regard helping others as an important criterion for evaluating competition results. The chassis workshop of the "Red Flag" Factory was the most backward workshop in the entire factory in January this year. Among more than eight hundred workers, 30% often failed to complete their production quotas, which affected the production of other workshops. However, since the workshop was led by party member Krichun, this situation has changed, and now only individual workers cannot complete their quotas. The workshop exceeded its production plan for the first three quarters of this year by 3%, won the Red Banner of Production, and became the most advanced workshop in the entire factory. Workshop director Krichun said that one of the important reasons why this workshop could change from backward to advanced is that the spirit of mutual assistance has been promoted among the workers, and the technical level of the workers has been universally improved.
    Through the enthusiastic socialist labor emulation movement, the workers of Stalin City exceeded the city's industrial production plan for the first three quarters of this year by 3.5%, and the labor productivity increased by 13.7% compared to the end of last year. At the same time, they also fulfilled the guarantee of saving 153 million lei this year ahead of schedule. At present, the workers of the city are carrying out an intense production competition to welcome the Fourth Congress of Romanian Trade Unions, and they want to create new production achievements to present to their congress.

### 斯大林城的劳动竞赛

    斯大林城的劳动竞赛
    喀尔巴阡山中的斯大林市是罗马尼亚的一个机器制造业中心，纺织工业、食品工业等也很发达。罗马尼亚的第一批拖拉机和载重汽车就是这里生产的。在全国的社会主义劳动竞赛中，斯大林市的数万名工人站在运动的前列。今年，有许多重要的倡议从这里传播到全国各地，为劳动竞赛运动树立了鲜明的旗帜。
    斯大林市车床厂提出的节约每毫米金属的倡议，得到了全国金属加工工人的响应。这个工厂的工人和工程师在研究了机器部件的生产过程后，认为许多部件的毛坯重量都超过了实际需要，在加工时浪费了不少金属。于是，他们提出了减小毛坯、节约每毫米金属的倡议。今年，这个工厂已经节约各种金属八十多吨。
      “每月节约够两天使用的材料”——这是“恩斯特·台尔曼”拖拉机工厂的锻工车间提出的倡议。全国各地的许多生产行业都已经按照这个倡议行动起来。到现在为止，这个车间已经节约了一百五十多吨金属。
    在相同专业工人间开展竞赛的做法，也是从斯大林市开始的，目前已经在全国普遍推广。这种专业竞赛的口号是争取成为本专业的最好的工人，如“最好的钳工”、“最好的车工”等等。斯大林市现在有九千多名工人参加了这种竞赛。
    斯大林市的各工厂和车间都成立了领导技术革新运动的机构，如“技术革新委员会”，“技术革新工作队”，“技术小组”等等。今年参加这个运动的工人愈来愈多。到现在为止，全市共有二千六百多名革新者，提出了三千多条革新建议。曾十八次获得生产红旗的“恩斯特·台尔曼”拖拉机工厂，去年生产了一万一千台拖拉机。今年国家给这个工厂的任务是生产一万六千台，而工人们保证生产一万七千台。实现这个保证的中心问题就是开展技术革新运动。在“恩斯特·台尔曼”拖拉机工厂，每四个工人中就有一名革新者，全厂今年已经提出了八百多项革新建议。“一级劳动勋章”获得者劳佐利阿建议，在制造散热箱时，用铝代替生铁，用焊接代替铆钉。这样，每个散热箱就可节约二十二公斤金属，每年能节约三百多吨金属，而且还使冷却效力提高了30％。他最近的另一项革新是使生产翻砂时所用的小铁支柱的工作机械化，把这项工作的劳动效率提高了二十多倍。
    在斯大林市各工厂企业中，有许多先进工人领导落后生产队和工人间相互帮助的事例。这里流行的一个口号是：“在你周围不能有落后者”。各工厂进行的专业生产竞赛都把帮助别人作为评定竞赛成绩的一项重要标准。“红旗”工厂的底盘车间在今年1月份还是全厂最落后的车间，八百多名工人中经常有30％的人完不成生产定额，以至影响了其它车间的生产；但是，这个车间自从由党员克里丘恩领导后，就改变了这种状况，现在只有个别的工人不能完成定额。这个车间超额3％完成了今年前三个季度的生产计划，获得了生产红旗，成为全厂最先进的车间。车间主任克里丘恩说，这个车间能由落后变为先进的重要原因之一是，在工人中间发扬了互助精神，普遍提高了工人的技术水平。
    通过热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛运动，斯大林市的工人们超额3.5％完成了今年前三个季度的全市工业生产计划，劳动生产率比去年底提高了13.7％，同时还提前实现了今年节约一亿五千三百万列伊的保证。目前全市工人们正在为迎接罗马尼亚工会第四次代表大会进行着紧张的生产竞赛，他们要创造新的生产成绩向自己的代表大会献礼。
