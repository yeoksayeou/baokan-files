Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 24th: Fujian Province's agricultural technology service teams are bringing science and technology to the forefront of agricultural production. At the same time, they are combining it with current production, working with local agricultural science and technology personnel and experienced old farmers to summarize, study, improve, and promote successful local experiences and innovations.

This agricultural technology service team is jointly organized by the Fujian Provincial Science Popularization Association, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Agricultural Machinery, the Bureau of Chemical Industry, the Bureau of Animal Husbandry, and other departments, and includes more than 560 science and technology personnel and production experts from various fields. They are divided into six groups and are conducting technical service work in six special zones, cities, thirty-one counties, and more than sixty people's communes within the province. In the past month or so, under the leadership of local Party committees, they have assisted communes and production teams in solving many key production problems, repairing, modifying, and installing more than 15,000 pieces of new-style farm tools, conducted more than 200 scientific research projects, and written 290 investigation reports. They have also cooperated with relevant departments to hold various on-site meetings, organize various lectures on scientific and technological issues, and short-term training courses, cultivating a large number of technical talents for the communes and relevant departments.

When bringing science and technology to the doorsteps of farmers, the agricultural technology service teams generally go deep into the fields, humbly learn from experienced farmers and grassroots technical personnel, and work with commune members to greatly enrich the content of scientific research through concrete production practices and investigations. For example, in Shunchang, Jian'ou, Jianning, Shaowu, and Sha County, the technical service teams, together with local scientific and technical personnel, cadres, and experienced farmers, summarized the local method of intercropping early and late rice varieties and harvesting them separately – "Ge Dou Qing." Adopting this cultivation method not only increased rice yields in mountainous areas but also saved labor. It is very beneficial for mountainous areas with more land and fewer people to expand the planting area of double-cropping rice and solve the problem of labor shortages during the busy season of summer harvesting and planting.

    把科学技术送到第一线
    福建大批农业技术人员深入基层
    据新华社福州24日电　福建省农业技术服务队把科学技术送上农业生产第一线，同时结合当前生产，同当地农业科学技术人员和有丰富生产经验的老农一起，总结研究当地成功的经验和创造加以提高和推广。
    这支农业技术服务队是由福建省科学普及协会、农业厅、农业机械厅、化工局、畜牧局等部门联合组织的，包括各个方面的科学技术人员、生产能手等五百六十多人。他们分成六个小组，到省内六个专区、市、三十一个县、六十多个人民公社开展技术服务工作。一个多月来，他们在当地党委领导下，已经协助公社、生产队解决了许多生产上的关键问题，修配、改装和安装了新式农具一万五千多件，进行了二百多项科学研究，写出了二百九十多篇调查报告，并且配合有关部门召开各种现场会议，举办各种科学技术问题讲座和短期训练班，为公社及有关部门培养了大批技术人才。
    农业技术服务队在把科学技术送上门时，普遍深入田间，虚心向老农和基层技术人员学习，和社员一起动手，通过具体的生产实践和调查研究，大大丰富了科学研究内容。如技术服务队在顺昌、建瓯、建宁、邵武、沙县等地，就同当地科学技术人员、干部、老农等共同总结了当地水稻早晚两季混合种植分别收获的栽培法——“割兜青”，采取这种栽培法不但提高了山区稻谷产量，而且节省劳力，对地多人少的山区扩大双季水稻种植面积，解决夏收夏种大忙期间劳力紧张等问题很有好处。
