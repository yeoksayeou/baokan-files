Xinhua News Agency, Anshan Electric Dispatch: Anshan Iron and Steel Company employees recently launched a campaign to recover scrap steel, recovering more than 50,000 tons of scrap steel in the first half of November alone.

In the first ten months of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company employees have already recovered more than 470,000 tons of scrap steel. While taking measures to promote the increased production of more high-quality iron in blast furnaces, the company's Party committee further mobilized employees to recover scrap steel, which can support steelmaking production and improve the production environment. Now, various factories and mines have formed many shock teams and treasure hunting teams, active in all corners of the company. In early November, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant recovered a total of more than 610 tons of scrap steel. The Welded Steel Tube Products Plant established a scrap steel recovery office, put forward the slogan "Pick up every piece, dig up everything, carry everything away," and launched a shock activity, recovering more than 600 tons of scrap steel in just two days of spare time. The young workers in various factories put forward the slogan "Pick up everything on the ground, dig up everything underground, don't go empty-handed to and from work, don't lose an ounce or a pound," acting as the main force in recovering scrap steel. More than 2,200 young workers at the Lingshan Machine Repair Plant dig for scrap steel every Saturday morning, recovering more than 1,000 tons at a time.

In this movement, units such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Company Transportation Department, the Transportation Team, and the Scrap Iron Plant, drew more than 30 train cars, more than 80 trucks, and a large amount of manpower and equipment every day to crush and transport scrap steel, supplying it to open-hearth steelmaking in a timely manner. At present, the daily volume of scrap steel transportation has increased from 500 tons in the past to more than 2,200 tons, and the processing volume of scrap steel has increased from 1,800 tons in the past to more than 3,000 tons, achieving simultaneous recovery, rushing transportation, processing, and utilization.

    收集废铁  勤俭炼钢
    鞍钢十个月回收废钢铁四十七万吨
    新华社鞍山电　鞍山钢铁公司职工最近展开回收废钢铁运动，仅11月上半月就回收了废钢铁五万多吨。
    鞍钢职工在今年前十个月已经回收了废钢铁四十七万多吨。公司党委在采取措施促进高炉增产更多优质铁的同时，进一步发动职工回收废钢铁，这样既可以支援炼钢生产，又可以改善生产环境。现在，各厂矿已经组成很多突击队、挖宝队，活跃在公司的各个角落。无缝钢管厂11月上旬共回收了六百一十多吨废钢铁。焊接钢管制品厂成立了回收废钢铁办公室，提出“拣光、挖光、运光”的口号，发动职工展开一次突击活动，仅两天的业余时间就回收了六百多吨废钢铁。各厂的青年工人们提出
  “拣光地上，挖尽地下，上下班不空手，斤两不能丢”的口号，充当回收废钢铁的主力军。灵山机修厂二千二百多名青年工人，在每星期六早晨都挖掘废钢铁，一次就回收了一千多吨。
    在这个运动中，鞍钢运输部、交通运输队、碎铁厂等单位，每天抽出三十多个火车皮、八十多辆汽车和大批人力、设备，破碎和运输废钢铁，及时供给平炉炼钢。目前废钢铁的日运量由过去的五百吨提高到二千二百吨以上，废钢铁加工量由过去的一千八百吨提高到三千多吨，做到了边回收、边抢运、边加工、边利用。
