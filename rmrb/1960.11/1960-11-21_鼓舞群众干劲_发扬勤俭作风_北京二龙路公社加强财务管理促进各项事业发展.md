    Beijing, November 20th. The Party Committee of the Erlong Road People's Commune in Beijing has strengthened financial management, basically achieving planned financial income and expenditure, warehouse management systems, expense standards, approved procedures, accumulation and distribution methods, and accounting records in production and service units. This has promoted the further consolidation and development of various undertakings in the commune.

    The Erlong Road Commune has always attached importance to financial management. Shortly after its establishment, it held financial training courses, with the Party Committee's chief secretary leading factory directors and branch secretaries from the commune's affiliated factories in earnestly studying relevant commune financial operations. At the same time, it adopted the approach of strengthening political and ideological education and organizing financial personnel to go to workshops to participate in production, establishing the view of financial work serving production, and mobilizing grassroots cadres to actively carry out financial work.

    In order to adapt to the development of various undertakings in the commune, the Erlong Road Commune promptly established and improved financial institutions. The entire commune established a financial planning group to uniformly manage commune finances. Also, based on the needs of the commune's affiliated units, a group of people with good political ideology and a certain level of education were selected from production and service businesses to serve as grassroots financial personnel. At present, financial institutions have been generally established in the commune's thirty-plus factories and enterprises, and financial personnel have been assigned. In the one hundred and eighty-plus collective welfare and service units, the method of unified financial management and separate accounting has been adopted, establishing seven central accounting offices according to systems such as public canteens, childcare organizations, and service stations, with part-time bookkeepers to clear accounts daily.

    The vast majority of the commune's financial accounting personnel are selected from street women. The commune's Party Committee adopted various methods to train them, rapidly improving their political and professional level. Since 1959, the commune has successively run ten training courses, training more than four hundred accounting personnel. In order to continuously consolidate training results, the commune also organized financial accounting personnel mutual aid groups by region to provide guidance, and adopted methods such as "old leading new" and "skilled leading unskilled" within factories and enterprises to organize mutual teaching and learning.

    While establishing financial institutions and training financial personnel, the commune's Party Committee also closely grasped the important link of establishing financial systems. In the early days of the commune's establishment, in response to the situation of unclear property and inconsistent accounts in the commune's enterprises and institutions, a comprehensive inventory and system establishment was carried out throughout the commune. Through this work, assets were cleared, a clear picture of the commune's resources was obtained, and necessary systems were established in areas such as financial management of commune-run industries, expense standards of the commune, warehouse management, and financial work of service businesses and collective welfare undertakings. In order to strictly implement various systems, in addition to delving into reality in their daily work and adopting the method of focusing on key points at ordinary times and addressing the overall situation at regular intervals to guide and inspect the financial work of commune-run factories and enterprises, commune financial personnel also launched a "two grasps, three checks" campaign, mobilizing grassroots enterprise management personnel to grasp financial management and implement systems, check the use of funds, cost accounting, and plan implementation. This not only supervised and inspected the implementation of various financial systems but also further improved the commune's financial management level.

    On the basis of the gradual improvement of various management systems, in order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of production personnel and promote the development of commune production, the commune began to pilot mass accounting in key factories from April this year. Many factories organized mass accounting promotion groups, widely mobilizing production personnel to discuss team accounting plans, which not only boosted the production enthusiasm of the masses but also further established the idea of running the commune diligently and thriftily.

    鼓舞群众干劲　发扬勤俭作风
    北京二龙路公社加强财务管理促进各项事业发展
    本报讯　北京市二龙路人民公社党委加强财务管理工作，在生产和服务事业单位基本做到财务收支有计划、仓库保管有制度、费用开支有标准、审核批准有手续、积累分配有办法、账务处理有凭据，促进了公社各项事业进一步巩固和发展。
    二龙路公社一直重视财务管理问题。建社不久，举办了财务训练班，由党委主管书记带领公社所属工厂厂长、支部书记，认真地学习了有关公社的财务业务。同时，采取加强政治思想教育和组织财务人员下车间参加生产的办法，树立财务工作为生产服务的观点，发动基层干部积极做好财务工作。
    为了适应公社各项事业的发展，二龙路公社及时建立和健全了财务机构，全公社除成立了财务计划组，统一管理公社财务工作外，还根据公社所属单位的需要，从生产和服务事业中选拔一批政治思想好、具有一定文化水平的人，担任基层的财务工作。现在，公社的三十多个工厂企业普遍建立起财务机构，并配备了财务人员。在一百八十多个集体福利和服务事业单位中，采取财务统一管理、分别核算的办法，按公共食堂、托儿组织和服务站等系统，分别设立了七个中心会计，下设兼职报账员，逐日清理账务。
    公社各单位的财务会计人员，绝大多数是从街道妇女中选拔出来的。公社党委采取各种办法进行培训，迅速提高了她们的政治和业务水平。从1959年以来，这个公社陆续开办了十次训练班，培训会计人员四百多人次。为了不断巩固培训成果，公社还按地区组织了财务会计人员互助组进行辅导，并在工厂企业内部采取以老带新、以熟带生等方法，组织互教互学。
    在建立财务机构和培训财务人员的同时，公社党委又紧紧抓住建立财务制度这一重要环节。在建社初期，针对公社企业和事业单位中财产不清、账实不符等情况，在全公社普遍开展了一次清产建制工作。通过这项工作，清理了资产，摸清了家底，并在社办工业财务管理、公社费用开支标准、仓库保管以及服务事业和集体福利事业的财务工作等方面，都相应地建立了必要的制度。为了严格贯彻执行各项制度，公社财务人员除在日常工作中，深入实际采取平时抓点、定时抓面的办法，对社办工厂企业的财务工作进行辅导和检查以外，还开展了“两抓、三查”的运动，发动基层企业管理人员抓财务管理和贯彻执行制度，查资金使用、成本核算和计划执行情况。这样不仅督促检查了各项财务制度的贯彻执行，还进一步提高了公社财务管理水平。
    在各项管理制度逐步健全的基础上，为了充分调动生产人员的积极性，促进公社生产的发展，这个公社从今年4月开始在重点工厂试行群众核算。许多工厂组织了群众核算推动小组，广泛发动生产人员讨论班组核算计划，不仅鼓舞了群众的生产热情，还进一步树立起勤俭办社的思想。
