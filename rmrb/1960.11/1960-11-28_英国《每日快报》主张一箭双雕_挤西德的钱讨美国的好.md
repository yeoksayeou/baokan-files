The British "Daily Express" Advocates Killing Two Birds with One Stone:
Squeezing Money from West Germany to Please the United States

    (Reported in this newspaper) The British "Daily Express" published an article on the 26th, advocating that West Germany alone should bear the responsibility for helping the United States to resolve the dollar crisis. The article wrote:

    While some important American officials gather in London to discuss the status of the dollar, a particular idea has gained popularity.

    What Mr. Macmillan hesitates to do is: whether to support the American financial demands on the Germans, or to support the Germans in resisting American pressure.

    The impression of British hesitation can only stem from Mr. Macmillan's hope that Britain will engage in economic cooperation with the continent.

    Indeed, there can be no doubt that Britain must support the United States, whether out of interest, emotion, or morality!

    Germany has now accumulated 3 billion pounds in foreign exchange reserves, almost three times the total of Britain.

    Its defense spending is about fifteen pounds per person, while Britain's is thirty-one pounds.

    It sits on its increasingly high pile of gold on the Rhine, while the sons of other countries are protecting it.

    Britain's policy and duty are clear: to squeeze money from the Germans for the sake of the United States, and to withdraw its own soldiers.

    英国《每日快报》主张一箭双雕
    挤西德的钱讨美国的好
    本报讯　英国《每日快报》26日发表一篇文章，主张由西德独力承担帮助美国解救美元危机的责任。文章写道：
    当一些重要的美国官员聚集在伦敦讨论美元地位的同时，一种特别的想法得到了流行。
    麦克米伦先生所迟疑不决的是：是支持美国人对德国人提出的财政要求呢，还是支持德国人来抗拒美国人的压力。
    英国的这种迟疑不决的印象只能是出自于麦克米伦先生的这种希望：英国将同大陆进行经济合作。
    的确，不能有丝毫怀疑的是：英国不论是出于利益还是情感还是道德都必须支持美国！
    德国现已积累了三十亿英镑的外汇储备，几乎三倍于英国的总数。
    它的防务费用为每人约十五英镑，而英国却为三十一英镑。
    它坐在它在来因河上日益增高的黄金堆上，而其他国家的儿子们却在保护它。
    英国的政策和职责是明确的：为了美国而把德国人的钱挤出来，并撤回它自己的士兵。
