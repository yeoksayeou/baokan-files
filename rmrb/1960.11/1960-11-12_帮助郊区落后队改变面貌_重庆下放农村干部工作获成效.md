Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 11th: Since the spring of this year, various government agencies and enterprises in Chongqing have adopted methods such as forming work teams and sending cadres to rural areas to serve in grassroots positions. As a result, 98% of the backward teams in the city's suburban people's communes have initially changed their appearance.

Under the unified arrangement of district and county party committees, various levels of government agencies, enterprises, schools, factories, and other units in Chongqing have adopted the following methods to assist backward rural teams in improving their work: Cadres are organized into work teams, with each work team contracting to assist one or two backward or poor teams to change their appearance within a set time limit. In some cases, leading cadres from the county party committee are responsible for rotating cadres from the entire unit to assist one or two fixed backward or poor teams to change their appearance. In addition, each unit has sent a group of core personnel to serve as deputy party branch secretaries, deputy production team leaders, and other positions in backward or poor teams to strengthen the leadership of these teams. According to statistics, more than 1,500 cadres throughout the city have been sent to form work teams to work in backward and poor teams. Currently, each backward and poor team in the city's suburban people's communes generally has three or four state cadres stationed in the team to assist in work and participate in labor training.

After the cadres formed work teams and went to the grassroots level or assumed leadership positions at the grassroots level, their sense of responsibility for changing the backward teams was greatly strengthened because the tasks were specific and the responsibilities were clear. The cadres who were sent to the rural communes of Ba County formed work teams to work in seventy-one backward and poor teams in the county. Under the leadership of the party committees of various communes, they began by climbing mountains and crossing ridges to visit the masses or holding heart-to-heart talks with cadres and the masses to find out the main problems of the backward teams. Then, they helped the grassroots cadres calculate three accounts: the production potential account, the labor potential account, and the account of favorable conditions for catching up with advanced teams, thereby encouraging the grassroots cadres' ambition to change the backward situation. The dispatched cadres also went deep into the canteens to help the brigades equip the canteen managers and cooks and establish various management systems. In particular, they helped more than 340 canteens in backward and poor teams across the county establish more than 11,000 mu of vegetable bases, which quickly enabled these canteens to provide enough vegetables for each person every day. At the same time, they also helped each team widely organize economic income, so that each team could issue wages on time. After carrying out these tasks, the enthusiasm of the commune members for production increased, and the attendance rate generally increased to more than 98%, with many teams achieving full attendance. At the same time, the dispatched cadres also helped the grassroots cadres learn to arrange production and labor and cultivate their ability to work independently. They helped these teams establish systems for attendance, work point evaluation, study, democratic life, and other systems, and formulated commune member conventions. The dispatched cadres also took the lead in launching the "high efficiency, high quality" red banner competition. More than 80% of the dispatched cadres and more than 30% of the commune members were rated as production red banner holders. Now, seventy of the original seventy-one backward and poor teams in the county have significantly changed their appearance.

After various units were linked to people's communes and cadres were sent to work in backward and poor teams for a long time, the business work was better able to serve agricultural production. In the past, the Yunji Grain Station in Changshou County only focused on business. When arranging the work of purchasing grain into storage, it often failed to make reasonable arrangements according to the specific situation of rural production, harvesting progress, and labor availability. After the cadres of this grain station were sent to production teams to participate in work and labor, all the cadres of the station understood the law of grain production and established the idea that business work must be closely combined with agricultural production. When arranging the plan for transporting purchased grain into storage, they were able to specifically solve the problems in each link of harvesting, threshing, drying, and transporting team by team according to the early or late maturity of crops in the fields, which promoted harvesting and made the purchase task faster and better than in the past.

After these state cadres were sent to work in the communes, they universally strengthened their labor concepts and mass concepts, established a hard-working and simple style, and the masses called them "good cadres sent by Chairman Mao" and "like relatives to us." Of the 179 cadres sent by the municipal government to Qijiang County, 67 were rated by the masses as "five good" (good in labor, work, policy implementation, contact with the masses, and study) cadres, accounting for 38%. Of the 26 cadres sent by Chongqing Medical College to Changshou, 12 were rated as advanced workers in the county.

    帮助郊区落后队改变面貌
    重庆下放农村干部工作获成效
    据新华社重庆11日电　重庆市各机关、企业今年春季以来，采取组成工作队和下放干部到农村担任基层工作等方法，帮助全市郊区人民公社中的落后队有98％初步改变了面貌。
    重庆市的各级机关和企业、学校、工厂等单位，在区、县委的统一安排下，采取了以下方法来帮助农村落后队改进工作：将下放干部组成工作队，每个工作队包干帮助一、二个落后队或穷队限期改变面貌，有的单位是由县委领导干部负责，轮流下放全单位的干部，帮助固定包干的一、二个落后队或穷队改变面貌。此外，各单位还下放一批骨干力量，担任落后队或穷队的党支部副书记、生产队副队长等职务，加强落后队的领导力量。据统计，全市仅组成工作队到落后队和穷队进行工作的下放干部就有一千五百多名。现在，全市郊区人民公社的每个落后队和穷队，一般都有三、四名国家干部驻队帮助工作和参加劳动锻炼。
    干部们组成工作队下到基层或到基层担任领导职务以后，因为任务具体，责任明确，大大加强了他们对改变落后队的责任心。组成工作队下放到巴县农村公社的干部，包干了全县七十一个落后队和穷队进行工作，他们在各个公社党委的领导下，一开始就翻山越岭访问群众或召开干部、群众谈心会，摸清了落后队的主要问题。接着，他们就帮助基层干部算好三笔账：生产潜力账、劳动潜力账和赶上先进队的有利条件账，从而鼓舞了基层干部改变落后面貌的雄心壮志。下放干部还深入食堂，帮助大队把食堂管理员和炊事员配备好，建立了各种管理制度，特别是帮助全县落后队和穷队的三百四十多个食堂建立了一万一千多亩蔬菜基地，很快就使这些食堂每天每人可以吃到足够的蔬菜。同时又帮助各队广泛组织经济收入，使各队都能按期发放工资。在进行这些工作以后，社员的生产积极性高涨，出勤率一般都提高到98％以上，许多队达到了全勤。同时，下放干部们又帮助基层干部学会安排生产和劳力，培养他们的独立工作能力。帮助这些队建立了考勤、评工分、学习、民主生活等制度，订立了社员公约。下放干部们又带头开展了“高工效、高质量”的红旗手竞赛运动。80％以上的下放干部和30％以上的社员都被评为生产红旗手。现在，全县原有的七十一个落后队和穷队，已有七十个队显著地改变了面貌。
    各个单位与人民公社挂钩，下放干部长期到落后队和穷队工作以后，也使业务工作更好地为农业生产服务。长寿县的云集粮站过去只单纯抓业务，在安排征购粮入仓工作时，常常不能按照农村生产收割进度和劳力忙闲的具体情况进行合理安排。这个粮站的干部下放到生产队参加工作和劳动以后，全站干部懂得了粮食生产规律和树立了业务工作必须紧密结合农业生产的思想，在安排征购粮运送入仓的计划时，就能根据田间作物成熟的迟早，逐队具体解决收、打、晒、运各个环节上的问题，既推动了收割，又使征购任务比过去完成得又快又好。
    这些国家干部下放公社工作后，普遍加强了劳动观点、群众观点，树立了艰苦朴素的作风，群众称他们是“毛主席派来的好干部”
  “跟我们像亲人一样”。市级机关下放到綦江县的一百七十九名干部，被群众评为“五好”（劳动、工作、执行政策、联系群众和学习好）干部的就有六十七人，占38％。下放在长寿的重庆医学院的二十六名干部中，有十二名被评为县的先进工作者。
