Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Dispatch: Dazhou City's industries in Sichuan Province are vigorously carrying out a technical innovation and technical revolution centered on improving labor productivity, saving labor, and supporting grain and steel production. Various industrial enterprises have successively transferred 1,550 people to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, and 1,882 people to participate in coal and iron production. While labor was being transferred, the city's industrial production made an all-round leap forward. From January to October, the output of 22 major products increased from one to seven times compared with the same period last year, costs decreased by 7.21 percent, and product quality also greatly improved.

Dazhou is one of the key counties in Sichuan Province for grain and pig iron production. The urban area has 53 factories and enterprises, including textile, food, leather, machinery, and chemical industries. Previously, the proportion of manual production in various factories and enterprises was relatively high, occupying more labor. In response to this situation, various factories and enterprises actively carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, first using animal power and electric power to replace human power to solve the power problem. After only three months of effort, 144 locations had replaced human power with animal power, and 15 small power stations were established. With the improvement of the power situation, the city's industrial technical innovation and technical revolution rapidly reached a climax. The number of renovated machines increased from more than 19,000 units (pieces) to more than 70,000 units (pieces), thus the utilization rate of machinery and equipment and labor productivity were generally improved. Nine factories achieved one equaling three or one equaling two, respectively. Nearly half of the factories, after transferring labor to support grain and steel production, still experienced significant production increases. Since the beginning of this year, the city has increased production of more than 1,600 sets of mining equipment such as coal crushers, blowers, water pumps, motors, and mine cars, and more than 30,000 various parts and accessories; the supply of machinery to rural areas has increased more than two times compared with the same period last year (January to October).

    大搞技术革命提高设备利用率和劳动生产率
    达县城区工业省人增产
    新华社成都电　四川达县城区工业大闹以提高劳动生产率为中心的技术革新和技术革命，节约劳动力，支援粮钢生产。各工业企业已陆续抽调出一千五百五十人下乡参加农业生产，一千八百八十二人参加煤铁生产。在抽调出劳动力的同时，全城工业生产全面跃进。1月至10月份，二十二种主要产品产量比去年同期分别增长一倍到七倍，成本下降百分之七点二一，产品质量也大大提高。
    达县是四川省粮食和生铁生产的重点县之一。城区有纺织、食品、皮革、机械、化工等五十三个工厂企业。各工厂企业原来手工生产比重较大，占用劳力较多。针对这种情况，各工厂企业都积极开展技术革新、技术革命运动，首先以畜力和电力来代替人力，解决动力问题。他们仅仅经过三个多月努力，就有一百四十四处以畜力代替了人力作动力，并且办起了小型电力站十五处。随着动力情况的改善，全城工业技术革新和技术革命迅速推向高潮，革新机具由一万九千多台（件）增加到七万多台（件），因而机械设备利用率、劳动生产率普遍提高，有九个工厂分别达到了一顶三或一顶二，有将近半数的厂在抽调出劳动力支援粮钢生产后，生产仍然有很大的增长。今年以来，全市仅增产的矿山设备如碎煤机、鼓风机、水泵、电动机、矿车等就有一千六百多台，其他各种零件配件三万多个；供应农村的机械比去年同期（1月至10月）增长了两倍多。
