    "A Winter's Tale"?
    Ye. Drabkina
    I had never seen Sverdlov as active as he was on October 1, 1918. "He has a two-hundred-thousand-horsepower engine inside him," a comrade said. Every movement of his was so light, and he was always in such a hurry when he did things, now he seemed not to be walking, but flying, as if he didn't feel his feet on the ground. He could go to ten or so places in a day – chairing meetings of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, attending meetings convened by the People's Committee, giving speeches at mass rallies in Red Army barracks, receiving representatives of peasants from Tambov Province who had come to petition, talking to a group of Party members who were being sent to the Southern Front, arranging for a sick comrade to be placed in a sanatorium, carefully studying an article that Lenin had just written with a pencil, and, in addition, quickly handling thousands of official matters!
    When did he sleep? Did he sleep at all? Every movement of his revealed that kind of abundant energy. He had always been composed in demeanor and neat in appearance, but now he did everything with such passion and excitement, so boisterously.
    "Just think about what's happening now!" he said loudly with excitement. "All this is not a myth, not a fantasy, but a real thing! Look how great our nation is! A precious nation! A magical giant!"
    One day, the political commissar of the Latvian Rifle Division, Petersons, and the commander of the artillery division, Berzin, came to see him. This Berzin was the one the British Minister to Russia, Lockhart, promised to give five or six million Tsarist rubles to, persuading him to participate in a counter-revolutionary plot to help overthrow the Soviet government and assassinate Lenin and Sverdlov.
    Berzin gave only ambiguous replies and immediately told Peters about Lockhart's idea. Following Peter's instructions, he pretended to fully agree, and later met with Lockhart, French Consul General L'Ollivier, and former U.S. Consul General Colomatchiano several times, thus infiltrating the conspiracy group, finding out the members participating in this group, and receiving over a million rubles from Lockhart's promised bribe – and then... he reported everything to the Anti-Counterrevolutionary Committee!
    I also saw it when Petersons and Berzin brought these million-plus rubles to show Sverdlov. The million-plus rubles were in a gray burlap sack. Petersons carried the money on his shoulder as if he were carrying several sacks of potatoes. He untied the rope on the sack and dumped piles of dirty banknotes onto a sofa. It is said that Lockhart had told Berzin that this money was collected by some "Russian rich men" for conspiracy activities. The cash was exchanged for several checks, which would be paid by the British government in the future.
    Sverdlov tore off a piece of newspaper, walked to the sofa piled with millions of rubles, lined it with the newspaper, picked up a stack of banknotes, brought his nearsighted eyes closer, and looked carefully.
    "It feels dirty just holding it," he said.
    Lockhart's conspiracy failed, and several of the conspirators quickly hid, while the rest were arrested and sent to court. A shy and happy smile appeared on Berzin's face.
    "This Lockhart is really an idiot," Yakov Mikhailovich said, looking at Berzin. "He actually came to you to do this kind of thing!"
    In early November, Sverdlov went to Petrograd for a few days – to convene the Congress of Poor Peasant Representatives. When he returned from there, he was extremely happy and excited. He could talk about the situation there again and again, repeating it dozens of times.
    Although miracles were common in those days, this congress was still like a miracle. Originally, it was only expected that five or six thousand people would attend the meeting, but as a result, more than ten thousand representatives attended! The Winter Palace was designated as the venue, but the palace was too small – so the first congress was held on Uritsky Square (now Palace Square). Later, it was held simultaneously in two large halls of the People's Amusement Hall. The congress passed a resolution to organize several model poor peasant groups, with each poor peasant committee selecting two of the most loyal, reliable, and beloved comrades to participate. Those attending the congress enthusiastically elected a delegation to go to Germany and Austria, which included Maxim Gorky. The delegation's task was to represent the Russian poor peasants in greeting the German and Austrian workers. We must know the situation in Russia at that time to imagine how big a step forward the peasants from Pskov, Olonets, Novgorod, and Cherepovets who attended this congress took in just one year after the socialist revolution!
    ...Furthermore, the situation in Germany was becoming more and more tense at this time.
    It could be seen that decisive events would occur in the next few days. Everyone was hoping that the German revolution would break out on November 7 – the same day as the Russian revolution.
    A few days before the holiday, we intercepted a radio telegram about a sailors' uprising in Kiel. The next day, everyone knew that the first Soviets had been established in Germany. Voices were heard throughout Germany calling for the overthrow of the William monarchy and the immediate conclusion of a peace treaty.
    Shortly before these events, the German Social Democratic Party had made a struggle to try to save the monarchy. A leader of the Social Democratic Party, named Philipp Scheidemann, participated in the government. However, all efforts could not stem the coming revolutionary storm.
    The Moscow radio station received orders: to report any intercepted information of any importance to Lenin and Sverdlov as quickly as possible.
    On November 9, a soldier on a bicycle arrived at the Grand Theater, where the Sixth Congress of Soviets was being held, and delivered a London radio message saying that a general strike had broken out in Berlin, thousands of workers had gathered in front of the Imperial Palace, and Liebknecht had declared Germany a socialist republic. Everyone cheered when they heard the news, and the huge crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling shook.
    An hour later, another soldier arrived on a bicycle. He brought the latest news: Philipp Scheidemann, who had recently been appointed State Secretary of the German Emperor's government, announced the establishment of the "German Free Democratic Republic" from a window in the Reichstag building.
    Vladimir Ilyich became melancholic after reading the radio message.
      "A hen crowing like a rooster is a bad omen," he said.
    Everyone was looking forward to the development of the situation. People generally had the feeling that they had returned to the days of Smolny.
    ... When I went to work on the morning of November 10, Sverdlov was already in his office. He was sitting at his desk, reading the mail that had accumulated during the holidays, but every quarter of an hour, he would pick up the receiver and call the radio station and the Rosta News Agency to ask if there was any news. The reply was always no. Finally, he couldn't help but drop his pen and start pacing around the room – like a person who had been in prison for a long time, pacing back and forth diagonally.
    "I can't work," he said, and then began to recite "A Winter's Tale." Heine was his favorite poet.
    Yakov Mikhailovich recited the verses in German:
      "New songs, better songs,
    Ah, friends,
    Let us compose a song for you!
    ...New songs, better songs,
    Now, friends, let's start singing
      Song:
    We want to turn the earth into heaven,
    This earth will become our heaven.
    Let us find happiness in life!
    No more tears, no more suffering!
    No longer use food obtained with industrious hands,
    To feed those lazybones.
    We all have enough bread..."
    When he read the line "We all have enough bread," he stopped, then whistled and said:
    "Bread... bread... How about this, if it is..." He lunged at the phone and called Lenin's office.
    "Vladimir Ilyich! Vladimir Ilyich!" he rushed to say, "How about this, if I try to make a direct call to Liebknecht, okay?... I'll go!"
    He returned about two hours later. His shrewd black eyes flashed a smile, his hat was cocked on the back of his head, and the collar of his leather coat was unbuttoned. He had just spoken to Berlin on the Hughes telegraph. First, the officer on duty at the German Foreign Ministry answered the phone. When he learned that the call was from Moscow, he tried to avoid answering it, but Sverdlov told him to find Liebknecht immediately to answer the phone, and to take personal responsibility for the matter. Half an hour later, the officer on duty answered the direct line again, apologizing and saying: It was a great pity that Liebknecht could not be found, because he was giving speeches at mass rallies in various districts of Berlin.
    ...I didn't know these details immediately at the time. At that time, as soon as Sverdlov returned from the telegraph office, he rushed to the telephone, picked up the receiver of the "upper-level switchboard," connected to the phone of Choppa of the People's Committee for Food, and said to him:
      "Alexander Dmitrievich! I finally caught you. How is the food situation? Immediately send the first direct train of grain to Berlin!"
  Note: "Germany – A Winter's Tale" is a long poem written by the German poet Heine (1797-1856).
    Kiel is a city in northwestern Germany, a naval port on the Baltic Sea. On October 28, 1918, German sailors held an uprising here.
    Philipp Scheidemann (1865-1939) was one of the leaders of the right-wing opportunists of the German Social Democratic Party.

    《一个冬天的童话》?
    叶·德拉伯金娜
    我从来没有见过斯维德洛夫像在1918年10月1日那样活跃。“他身体里装了一架二十万马力的发动机，”一位同志说。他一举一动都是那么轻快，做起事来老是那么赶急，现在他仿佛不是在走，而是在飞，仿佛没有觉得脚踏在地上。他能够在一天里到十来个地方去活动——在全俄中央执行委员会担任会议主席，出席人民委员会召开的会议，在红军营房里的群众大会上发表演说，接见唐波夫省来请愿的农民代表，跟一群派往南方战线去的党员谈话，将一个有病的同志安置在疗养院里，拿着铅笔仔细地研究列宁刚写好的一篇文章，此外还要尽快地办好上千件公事！
    他什么时候睡觉呀？他究竟睡不睡呢？他的每一个动作中都流露出那种充沛的精力。他一向是举止从容、外表整洁的，而现在他做什么事都是那么热情激动，吵吵闹闹的。
    “你们想想现在发生的事情吧！”他激动地大声说，“这一切都不是神话，不是幻想，而是千真万确的事情！再瞧咱们的民族多么了不起！可贵的民族啊！神奇的巨人啊！”
    有一天，拉脱维亚步兵师政委彼捷尔松和炮兵师师长别尔津来看他。这个别尔津就是英国驻俄国公使罗卡尔特答应给他五六百万沙皇卢布，劝他参加反革命阴谋，帮助推翻苏维埃政府、刺杀列宁和斯维德洛夫的那个别尔津。
    别尔津只作了模棱的答复，当时就把罗卡尔特的主意转告了彼特尔斯。他按照彼特尔斯的指示，假装完全同意，以后曾经几次会见罗卡尔特、法国总领事路连纳尔以及前美国总领事柯洛玛契安诺，就这样打进了阴谋集团，探听出参加这一集团的分子，并且从罗卡尔特那里领到了他所允许的贿赂中的一百多万卢布——然后……他把一切报告了肃反委员会！
    当彼捷尔松和别尔津把这一百多万卢布带来给斯维德洛夫看的时候，我也看见了。一百多万卢布装在一个灰色的麻布袋里。彼捷尔松把钱掮在肩上，就好像掮着几袋马铃薯似的。他解开袋上捆着的绳子，把一叠叠肮脏的钞票倒出来，堆在一张沙发上。据说，罗卡尔特曾经告诉别尔津，说这些钱是一些“俄国阔佬”搜集了来，为了进行阴谋活动用的。现款调换了几张支票，这些支票将来由英国政府支付。
    斯维德洛夫撕下了一块报纸，走到堆着百万卢布的沙发跟前，用报纸衬着，捡起了一叠钞票，把近视眼凑得更近，仔细地看。
    “拿在手里都嫌肮脏，”他说。
    罗卡尔特的阴谋失败了，有几个参加阴谋的分子赶快躲藏起来，其余的都被逮捕了，送到法院去。别尔津的脸上现出了觍腼腆快乐的微笑。
    “这个罗卡尔特真是一个笨蛋，”雅科夫·米哈伊洛维奇望着别尔津说，“他居然会找您干这种事！”
    11月初旬，斯维德洛夫到彼得尔去了几天——去召开贫农代表大会。他从那里回来的时候，快乐和兴奋到了极点。他尽可以把那里的情形说了再说，重复地说上几十遍。
    虽然那些日子里的奇迹已经数见不鲜，但这次的代表大会仍像是一个奇迹。原来只指望有五六千人出席会议的，但结果到会的却有一万多位代表！冬宫被指定作会场，但是皇宫嫌小了——于是第一届大会改在乌利茨基广场（现皇宫广场）上召开。后来，又在民众文娱馆内两个大厅里同时举行。大会通过了决议，要组织几个贫农模范团，由每一个贫农委员会选出两名最忠实可靠和受人爱戴的同志参加。出席大会的人，热情高涨地选出了一个往德国和奥国去的代表团，团里有马克辛·高尔基。代表团的任务是代表俄国贫农问候德国和奥国工人。我们必须知道当时俄国的情形，才能够想像出：在社会主义革命后仅仅一年以内，那些出席这次代表大会的普斯可夫、奥隆涅茨、诺夫哥罗得以及切烈波威茨的农民竟然会向前跨进了这么一大步！
    ……再说，这时候德国的局势一天比一天更紧张。
    看得出来，在最近的几天内就要发生决定性的事件。大伙儿都在巴望德国革命将在11月7日爆发——和俄国革命发生在同一个日子。
    就在节日前的几天，我们截获了一份有关水兵在基尔起义?的无线电报。第二天，大伙儿都知道德国已经成立了第一批苏维埃。德国各地都发出了呼声，要求推翻威廉君主政体，立即缔结和约。
    在这些事件发生之前不久，德国社会民主党曾作了一番挣扎，企图挽救君主政体。社会民主党的一个首领，叫菲利普·谢德曼?的，参加了政府。但是，一切努力都不能遏止住那即将来临的革命风暴。
    莫斯科的无线电台，接到了命令：把截获的情报，只要是有些重要性的，都赶快报告给列宁和斯维德洛夫。
    11月9日，一个士兵乘着自行车，到了正在开第六届苏维埃代表大会的大剧院，送来一份伦敦无线电讯，说柏林暴发了总罢工，皇宫前面聚集了几千工人，李卜克内西已经宣布德国为社会主义共和国。大伙儿一听到这消息，欢声雷动，天花板下的巨型枝形水晶玻璃吊灯都摇晃起来。
    一小时后，又来了一个乘自行车的士兵。他带来了最后的消息：不久前刚任德皇政府的国务大臣的菲列普·谢德曼，在国会大厦的窗子里宣布成立“德意志自由民主共和国”。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇看完了无线电报，变得忧郁了。
      “雌鸡学雄鸡啼，这是一个不好的兆头，”他说。
    大伙儿都盼望着事态发展。一般人都有这样的感觉，仿佛又回到斯莫尔尼的日子了。
    ……11月10日早晨，我去上班的时候，斯维德洛夫已经到了他的办公室。他坐在桌子旁边，看节日这些天里积起来的邮件，但是，每隔一刻钟，就要拿起听筒，打电话给无线电台和罗斯塔通讯社，问有没有消息。那里都回说没有。最后，他忍不住丢了钢笔，开始在屋子里踱来踱去——像在监狱中坐久了的人那样，笔直地沿着对角线来回踱着。
    “我没法工作啦，”他说，接着就开始朗诵《一个冬天的童话》。海涅是他喜爱的诗人。
    雅可夫·米哈伊洛维奇用德文背诵诗句：
      “新的歌，更好的歌，
    啊，朋友们，
    让我们给你们编一首歌！
    ……新的歌，更好的歌，
    现在，朋友们，我们来开始唱
      歌：
    我们要把地变成天，
    这地将成为我们的天国。
    让我们在生活中得到幸福！
    再不要流泪，再不要受苦！
    再不要用勤劳的手获得的食
      物，
    去供那些懒汉果腹。
    我们人人都有够吃的面包……
    读到“我们人人都有够吃的面包。”这一行，他停下了，接着吹了一个口哨，说道：
    “面包……面包……这样可好，如果是……”他扑到电话跟前，叫接列宁的办公室。
    “弗拉基米尔·伊里奇！弗拉基米尔·伊里奇！”他抢着说，“这样可好吗，如果我试试跟李卜克内西直接通一个电话，好吗？……我就去！”
    大约两小时后，他回来了。他那双精明的黑眼睛闪出了微笑，帽子扣在后脑勺上，皮大衣的领子解开了。他刚用休斯式电话机跟柏林方面通了话。先是德国外交部的值勤员来接电话。他知道了这电话是从莫斯科打去的，就企图回避不接，但是斯维德洛夫叫他立刻去找李卜克内西来听电话，并且要他个人对这件事负责。过了半小时，值勤的又来接直线电话，道歉说：很是遗憾，没法找到李卜克内西，因为他正在柏林各区的群众大会上演说。
    ……这一些细节，我并不是当时立刻知道的。那时候，斯维德洛夫从电报总局一回来，就赶到电话跟前，拿起了“上层交换台”的听筒，接通了粮食人民委员会乔普帕的电话，跟他说：
      “亚历山大·季米特利耶维奇！我到底把您捉到啦。粮食的问题怎么样了？立刻把第一列直达的运粮车开到柏林去！”
