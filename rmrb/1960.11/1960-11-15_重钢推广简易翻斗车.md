Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 14th: Recently, a remarkable train car has appeared on the railway tracks of the Chongqing Steel Company's factory area. When the train arrives at the unloading point, it can automatically unload the materials on the car in less than two minutes. This type of car is called a "Simple Dump Truck," and it was created by Huang Rongchang, a well-known national model worker and Deputy Chief Engineer and Director of the Mechanization Workshop of Chongqing Steel, along with technical personnel and veteran workers using the "three-in-one" method. The emergence of this major innovation has solved the key problem of Chongqing Steel's vehicle unloading, which has been labor-intensive and time-consuming for many years, affecting the turnover of train cars. Currently, Chongqing Steel departments are vigorously rushing to produce and promote this type of car.

The advantages of using this type of car are: shortening the unloading time, which used to take at least an hour or more per carload, but now takes just over a minute; it can greatly reduce the number of unloading personnel; accelerate the turnover of train cars, and reduce backlog.

    重钢推广简易翻斗车
    据新华社重庆14日电  在重庆钢铁公司厂区的火车道上，新近出现了一节引人注目的火车车皮。火车行驶到倾卸地点，不到两分钟时间，就可以把车上的物资自动卸完。这种车皮名叫为“简易翻斗车”，是著名的全国劳动模范、重钢副总工程师兼机械化车间主任黄荣昌，同车间技术人员、老工人用“三结合”的办法创制成的。这项重大革新的出现，解决了重钢多少年来车辆卸货时费人费力、影响车皮周转的关键。目前，重钢部门正在大力赶制和推广这种车皮。
    使用这种车皮的好处是：缩短了卸车时间，过去卸一车皮至少要一小时以上，现在不过一分多钟；可以大量减少卸车人员；加速车皮周转，减少积压。
