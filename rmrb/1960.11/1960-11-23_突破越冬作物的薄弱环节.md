    Break Through the Weak Links in Overwintering Crops
    According to a report in the Hebei Daily: The Yongnian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the production teams to implement the "three guarantees and one reward" policy, help the production teams to manage early-sown wheat, and focus on late-sown wheat, determined to eliminate the third-class seedlings in the initial stage, in order to create conditions for a comprehensive bumper harvest in the summer of next year. This news raises a very important issue in the field management of overwintering crops this year.
    The sowing quality of overwintering crops (mainly winter wheat, as well as some buckwheat, barley, rapeseed, and green manure) in most areas this year is quite good; during the sowing period, many areas had consecutive soaking rains, and the wheat seedlings generally emerged neatly and grew vigorously. However, we should also see that several major winter wheat producing areas suffered severe droughts in the spring and summer of this year, and there are more late-sown crops; although these areas prepared for wheat planting early, the proportion of late-sown wheat is still quite large due to the late clearing of stubble. According to statistics from Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Shaanxi provinces, late-sown wheat generally accounts for about 50%. In addition, some dryland wheat, intercropped wheat, wheat planted in a rush for soil moisture, wheat with insufficient base fertilizer, and wheat in low-lying saline-alkali land and sandy, thin, and leaky land are not growing well enough. Due to these various circumstances, many counties and communes have a certain number of third-class wheat seedlings. According to years of experience, if measures are taken early, with extra fertilizer, extra water, and extra management, these wheat seedlings can be upgraded completely. Last year, the Houlyu Production Team of the Xiyou Commune in Ye County, Shandong, had 300 mu of late-sown wheat, which initially did not grow well enough; later, the field management was strengthened, and this year the yield per mu reached 334 jin, catching up with early-sown wheat and overfulfilling the production quota. Some other production teams in this commune did not grasp the management of late-sown wheat and third-class seedlings early enough, and this year's yield per mu was more than 50 jin less than early-sown wheat. According to the commune's calculations: if the management is strengthened this year to make all 6,000 mu of late-sown wheat in the entire commune catch up with early-sown wheat, more than 300,000 jin of wheat can be harvested next summer. From this, we can see how important it is to strengthen the management of late-sown wheat this year and eliminate third-class seedlings as early as possible.
    Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us that we should not use our strength equally when leading any work. Grasping the key issues in the work and concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles is an important guarantee for winning victory. The relatively large number of late-sown wheat and third-class seedlings formed due to the influence of natural conditions this year are the weak links in striving for a bumper harvest next summer. While managing early-sown wheat well, we should concentrate more strength (that is, extra fertilizer, extra water, and extra management) to break through this weak link, so that late-sown wheat can catch up with early-sown wheat, and third-class seedlings can catch up with first-class seedlings, and strive for a comprehensive bumper wheat harvest next year. Yongnian County planted 120,000 mu of late-sown wheat this year. The county party committee timely organized more than 1,000 cadres to help the production teams to focus on managing late-sown wheat, and this approach is very correct. Of course, focusing on the management of late-sown wheat and third-class seedlings does not mean that we can relax the management of first and second-class seedlings and early-sown wheat. The reason why we emphasize managing late-sown wheat and third-class seedlings well is only to promote the backward to catch up with the advanced, and to promote the advanced to become even more advanced.
    To strengthen the field management of wheat, we must prescribe the right medicine according to the condition of the seedlings. Topdressing, winter irrigation, harrowing, and middle tillage should be determined according to the specific conditions of each commune and each team, adapting to the time and adapting to the place. For example, winter irrigation should consider soil moisture, water sources, time, and location, and comprehensively consider various conditions to formulate a practical and feasible plan. The production team is the grass-roots unit for organizing production. The cadres of the production team and the commune members know the specific conditions of each wheat field best, are most familiar with the local meteorological laws, and are most clear about the methods for eliminating third-class seedlings locally and at that time. They have the right to formulate various practical technical measures and have the right to rationally arrange various farm work. The commune and the production team should be good at guiding and helping, and should not interfere and command blindly without considering the specific situation.
    How to mobilize the enthusiasm of the production teams to manage wheat fields? In addition to the party organizations of the commune and the production team frequently conducting education on "running agriculture on a large scale and running grain production on a large scale" to improve the awareness of grass-roots cadres and the broad masses of commune members, implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" policy and carrying out over-production competitions is also a very effective measure. "Three guarantees and one reward" is an extremely important management system and is one of the specific contents of the small part of ownership of the production team. Formulating and implementing the "three guarantees and one reward" as soon as possible will help mobilize the enthusiasm of the production teams and the broad masses of commune members and strengthen their sense of responsibility. Places that have not yet formulated the "three guarantees and one reward" plan for winter wheat should immediately mobilize the masses to formulate it effectively. Production teams that have already formulated the "three guarantees and one reward" plan for wheat should also generally check whether the "three guarantees" are reasonable and whether it is possible to over-produce in the summer harvest next year. The specific contents of the "three guarantees and one reward" for wheat should be clearly announced to the commune members so that they know the production target, labor input, and production cost of wheat next year. "When the masses are of one mind, everything will be easy to handle." The "three guarantees and one reward" policy not only conforms to the long-term interests of the masses but also conforms to their current interests and should be made known to every household and everyone should have a clear understanding. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is to make the masses aware of their own interests and unite to fight for their own interests." Striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year is the fundamental interest of the masses and also their current interest. After the "three guarantees and one reward" is implemented, the interests of the large collective and the small collective will be combined, and the masses will inevitably work together with one heart and one mind, and the mass movement of over-production will be launched.
    Overwintering crops are the earliest season of crops to be harvested next year and account for a large proportion of grain crops and oil crops. This is the first battle on the agricultural front next year, and our task is to fully mobilize the masses, conscientiously implement the policy, and go all out to fight this battle well.

### 突破越冬作物的薄弱环节

    突破越冬作物的薄弱环节
    据河北日报消息：中共河北永年县委组织大批干部，深入生产队，贯彻执行“三包一奖”政策，帮助生产小队抓好早茬麦，偏管晚茬麦，决心把三类苗消灭在初生阶段，为夺取明年夏季全面大丰收创造条件。这个消息提出了今年越冬作物田间管理中一个十分重要的问题。
    今年大部分地区的越冬作物（主要是冬小麦，还有一部分元麦、大麦、油菜、绿肥）的播种质量是相当好的；播种期间，许多地区连降透雨，麦苗一般出得整齐，长得茁壮。但是，我们同时应该看到，几个冬小麦主要产区，在今年春夏两季严重干旱，晚茬作物较多；这些地区种麦准备工作虽早，但因腾茬较晚，晚茬麦占的比重还相当大。据河南、山东、河北、陕西几省统计，晚茬麦一般要占50％左右。此外，有一部分旱地小麦、间作套种的小麦，抢墒下种、底肥不足的小麦和低洼盐碱地、砂薄漏地的小麦，长得也不够好。由于这种种情况，许多县和公社都有一定数量的三类麦。根据多年来的经验，如果及早采取措施，偏肥偏水偏管理，这部分麦苗完全可以升级。山东掖县西由公社后吕生产队去年有三百亩晚茬麦，最初长得不够好；后来加强了田间管理，今年亩产达到三百三十四斤，赶上早茬麦，超额完成包产指标。这个公社的另一些生产队对晚茬麦和三类苗的管理抓得晚了，今年每亩产量比早茬麦少收五十多斤。据这个公社计算：如果今年加强管理，使全公社的六千亩晚茬麦全部赶上早茬麦，明年夏季可以多收小麦三十多万斤。从一点以概其余，可以看到今年加强晚茬麦的管理，及早消灭三类苗是多么重要。
    毛泽东同志经常教导我们，领导任何工作，都不能平均使用力量。抓住工作中的关键问题，集中优势兵力打歼灭战，是赢得胜利的重要保证。由于今年自然条件的影响而形成的较多的晚茬麦和三类苗，是争取明年夏季丰收的薄弱环节。我们应该在管好早茬麦的同时，集中更多的力量（也就是偏肥、偏水、偏管理），突破这个薄弱环节，使晚茬麦赶上早茬麦、三类苗赶上一类苗，争取明年小麦全面丰收。永年县今年种了十二万亩晚茬麦。县委及时组织一千多名干部，帮助生产小队，偏管晚茬麦，这种作法是很对的。当然，偏管晚茬麦和三类苗，决不意味着可以放松一、二类苗和早茬麦。这里所以这样强调管好晚茬麦、三类苗，只是为了推动后进赶先进，促使先进更先进。
    加强小麦田间管理，要根据苗情，对症下药。追肥、冬灌、压耙、中耕，都要根据各社、各队的具体情况，因时制宜、因地制宜而定。例如冬灌，就要看墒情、看水源、看时间、看地点，综合各种条件，订出切实可行的方案。生产小队是组织生产的基层单位，生产小队的干部和社员群众，最了解每一块麦田的具体情况，最熟悉当地的气象规律，最清楚在当地当时消灭三类苗的办法。他们有权制定各种切合实际的技术措施，有权合理安排各种农活，公社和生产队要善于指点，善于帮助，而不要不看具体情况，乱干涉、乱指挥。
    怎样把生产小队管理麦田的积极性调动起来？除了公社、生产队的党组织经常进行关于“大办农业、大办粮食”的教育，提高基层干部和广大社员的觉悟水平以外，贯彻执行“三包一奖”的政策，开展超包产竞赛，也是一项很有效的措施。“三包一奖”是一项极重要的管理制度，是生产小队小部分所有制的具体内容之一。尽快地把“三包一奖”订好、落实，便于调动生产小队和社员群众的积极性，加强他们的责任感。还没有制订冬小麦“三包一奖”方案的地方，要立即发动群众切实订好。已经订了小麦“三包一奖”方案的生产队，也要普遍检查“三包”是否合理，明年夏收是否可能做到有产可超。要向社员群众明确宣布小麦“三包一奖”的具体内容，使社员知道明年小麦的产量指标、劳动用工量和生产成本。“群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。”“三包一奖”政策既符合群众的长远利益，又符合群众的当前利益，应当做到家喻户晓，人人摸底。毛泽东同志说过，“马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是要使群众认识自己的利益，并且团结起来，为自己的利益而奋斗。”争取小麦明年丰收，是群众的根本利益，也是群众的当前利益。“三包一奖”落实以后，把大集体和小集体的利益结合起来，群众必然同心协力，干劲倍增，超包产的群众运动就会开展起来。
  越冬作物是明年收获最早的一季作物，在粮食作物和油料作物中占有很大的比重。这是明年农业战线上的第一仗，我们的任务是充分发动群众，认真贯彻执行政策，全力打好这一仗。
