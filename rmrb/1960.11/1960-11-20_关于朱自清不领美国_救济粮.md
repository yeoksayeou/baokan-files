On Zhu Ziqing's Refusal to Accept American "Relief Food"
Wu Han

"Zhu Ziqing, seriously ill, would rather starve to death than accept American 'relief food'." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, p. 1499)

I feel particularly close and indignant about this matter. Although it happened more than ten years ago, reading these words now still brings the scene vividly to mind.

The so-called "relief food" was about this: Around June 1948, the Kuomintang government's legal tender was depreciating like a rushing river, constantly losing value; a pack of cigarettes cost tens of thousands of dollars. Professors' salaries were increasing monthly, but the legal tender depreciated even faster, and prices rose even faster. The professors, who originally lived relatively well, were now, like the vast majority of the people, unable to survive. Especially those with large families faced even greater difficulties.

The Kuomintang government was aware of the people's resentment, especially the intellectuals in universities, who were becoming increasingly intolerant of the situation. So, they employed a trick, issuing a kind of purchase permit that allowed people to buy "American-aid flour" at lower prices.

At the same time, the American government was actively supporting Japan, and the American Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, was making slanderous and insulting noises towards the Chinese people.

On the one hand, there was cheap bribery, and on the other, the support of Japan and the insult of the Chinese people. Some of us discussed it and decided to expose the Kuomintang government's conspiracy and protest the American government's insults by issuing a public statement. The statement went like this:

To oppose the American government's pro-Japanese policy, to protest the slander and insults of the Shanghai American Consul General Cabot and the American Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, against the Chinese people, and to demonstrate the dignity and integrity of the Chinese people, we resolutely refuse all forms of American charity, whether purchased or given, that are aimed at buying our souls. The following people agree to refuse to purchase American-aid low-price flour and unanimously return their purchase permits.

June 17, Year 37 [1948]

After the statement was written, signatures had to be collected. As usual, it was decided that each person would be responsible for contacting several others, and I was mostly responsible for running errands for the older professors. I took the draft to Mr. Zhu Ziqing.

At this time, his stomach ailment was already very serious. He could only eat very little, and a little more would cause him to vomit. His face was gaunt, and his voice was low. He had seven children of all sizes, and his life was more difficult than anyone else's. But as soon as he saw the draft, he signed it without hesitation. He always wrote neatly, and this time he still signed his name meticulously with a trembling hand.

At this point, it should also be mentioned that after returning to Tsinghua Garden from Kunming in 1946, his attitude had changed significantly; he was no longer silent. He opposed the civil war and disliked the Kuomintang. His views on the Communist Party also began to change. He had publicly recited poetry from the Liberated Areas at rallies, and sometimes even dressed up with students to perform the Yangko dance, working up a sweat. In the struggles against the United States and the Kuomintang, I always looked for him. As soon as he saw me, he understood what I wanted. "Is it for signatures?" After reading the draft, he would write his name. As far as I can remember, he signed eight or nine times out of ten. There were also times when he didn't sign because the wording was too fiery.

This time, I also approached some other professors, mostly ones I was familiar with or who lived nearby, and most of them signed. But I also met with some resistance. One professor, who only had three children, gave a very straightforward reply: "No! I still want to live!"

His stomach ailment came from starvation. There were many people to feed. In the later period in Kunming, someone had calculated that the salaries of people like us, converted to silver dollars before the war, were only about ten yuan.

He was concerned about politics, but he didn't express his opinions much. When he did, it was gentle and refined, without any fire. During the War of Resistance, news was blocked by the Kuomintang. People in the rear areas were not clear about the true situation of the Kuomintang's passive resistance to Japanese imperialism and its active friction with the Communist Party, which sparked several anti-communist climaxes. He believed that as long as we resisted, it was okay to live a little harder, and he rarely complained. Although he sympathized with many political activities in Kunming, he rarely participated. After the Kuomintang reactionaries assassinated Wen Yiduo, he felt extremely indignant. After returning to Beiping after the war, and seeing the American imperialists helping the Kuomintang launch a civil war on a large scale, his attitude changed. He stood up in front of the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries. Except for a few times, he joined our ranks.

Several things are worth mentioning. One is his effort in compiling the "Complete Works of Wen Yiduo." In the postscript of the complete works, I pointed out:

Mr. Peixian was Yiduo's old friend and colleague for more than ten years. For this book, he spent a year collecting posthumous works, compiling, and correcting them. He drafted the catalog... In short, without Mr. Peixian's labor and leadership, this collection would not have been possible.

At that time, the act of compiling and printing the Complete Works of Yiduo was a protest and condemnation of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In contrast, compared to some people who were once Yiduo's classmates or old classmates with twenty or thirty years of friendship, they never cared about this matter after Yiduo's death, nor did they write a commemorative article.

Another thing is his care for young students. For example, one time two students in his department had a fight, one from the Democratic Youth League and one from the Kuomintang Three People's Principles Youth League. The cause of the fight was, of course, political. Both went to the teacher to complain. Mr. Ziqing, fearing that the Minqing student would be at a disadvantage, secretly advised him to give in a little. After I learned about this, I wrote a letter expressing my opinion, asking him to consider who was right and wrong politically. Perhaps the tone of my wording was a little sharp. The next day, he came to my house and very seriously explained his intentions. Criticizing the worthy is a traditional concept; he said that he said a few words to the progressive student in order to protect him from the revenge of the Three People's Principles Youth League. At the same time, he also agreed that my opinion was correct. Afterward, I told this situation to the Minqing student, and this student was also very moved.

His opposition to the Kuomintang's secret agent rule, although he did not shout loudly, can also be seen from an incident I personally experienced. At this time, the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to save their dying fate, strengthened their secret agent control over universities. To protest, I wrote an academic paper "Schools in the Early Ming Dynasty," which talked about the early Ming Dynasty but scolded the Kuomintang reactionaries. I sent it to the school journal "Tsinghua Journal" for publication. Some of the journal's editors were Kuomintang members, and of course they were unwilling to publish it, believing that it was not an academic article. I talked to Mr. Ziqing about it. He was also a member of the editorial board of the journal and strongly advocated for its publication, writing a letter to the editor-in-chief, and finally this article was published. From this incident, we can see the changes in his thoughts and feelings. He had changed. Although he was tormented by stomach ailments for a long time and his body was excessively weak, he also understood that dawn was coming, the dark clouds were about to pass, and good days were coming. He felt gratified and wrote two lines of poetry under the glass of his desk: "Better to have an infinitely good sunset; Why be sad when nearing dusk?" These two lines of poetry very aptly expressed his mood in his later years.

On July 23, a symposium on "The Tasks of Intellectuals Today" was held in the Gongzi Hall of Tsinghua University. This was the last political activity he participated in. I personally went to his house to invite him, and walked slowly with him from the North Yard to the Gongzi Hall. He walked for a while, stopped for a while, and said to me intermittently: "You are right, you are on the right path. However, people like me are not very used to it yet. You have to educate us, slowly. This way, we can catch up with you." He also spoke at the meeting, and the main point was still this idea. He said: "There are two paths for intellectuals: one is to be accomplices and idlers, climbing upwards. There are such people in feudal and capitalist societies. The other is to go downwards. Intellectuals can go up or down, so they are a stratum rather than a class. It is not easy for many intellectuals to abandon their vested interests. Now we can't live the life of the masses. This is not because we are unwilling to accept it in terms of reason. Reason knows that we should accept it, but we cannot change our habits.

Mr. Ziqing knew in reason that he had to abandon his vested interests and live the life of the masses. He had taken another step forward, a big step forward.

He refused to buy American-aid flour. After signing his name, he recorded this event in his diary that day:

June 18: This matter will cost the family six million legal tender each month, which will have a great impact on the family, but I still decided to sign. Because if we oppose America's support of Japan, we should start directly with ourselves.

From this, we can see his determination. Not only that, but the day before his death, he also told his wife: "There is one thing you must remember: I signed the document refusing American-aid flour!"

Mr. Ziqing was a typical figure among intellectuals in the old era. He was once a liberal. He did not particularly like to participate in political activities, especially political activities that were more intense and combative. However, he had a sense of justice. As the Kuomintang and American imperialism intensified their enslavement and oppression of the Chinese people, and their armed provocations, massacres, and suppression of the Chinese people, he finally could not bear it. He spoke, he acted, expressing his attitude through cultural life, reciting poetry, and performing the Yangko dance. On the other hand, he resolutely did not take the middle road, the third path. At that time, someone wanted him to participate in a middle-of-the-road publication run by the Kuomintang called "New Road," but he resolutely refused. But he participated in our symposium despite his illness.

He clearly distinguished right from wrong, had clear likes and dislikes, and in his declining and sickly later years, he finally had a clear position, raised his head, straightened his spine, and would rather starve to death than resolutely refuse the enemy's "relief." This kind of character and integrity is worthy of our learning today.

"We Chinese people have backbone. Many people who were once liberals or democratic individualists have stood up in the face of American imperialists and their running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume IV, p. 1499) Comrade Mao Zedong praised the backbone of Wen Yiduo and Zhu Ziqing, saying that "we should write an ode to Wen Yiduo, and write an ode to Zhu Ziqing." This is the responsibility of us who have not died, especially the comrades-in-arms of Mr. Yiduo and Mr. Ziqing during their lifetimes. This kind of ode, expressing the heroic spirit of our nation, still awaits the future. This article can only be regarded as some memories triggered by rereading the article "Farewell, Leighton Stuart."

    关于朱自清不领美国“救济粮”
    吴晗
    “朱自清一身重病，宁可饿死，不领美国的‘救济粮’。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1499页）
    我对这件事特别感到亲切、悲愤。事情隔了十几年了，现在读到这几句话，当时情景还历历如在目前。
    所谓“救济粮”是这么一回事：1948年6月间，那时候国民党政府的法币像大江东下一样，时时刻刻在贬值，买一包纸烟要几万块钱。教授的薪水月月在涨，但是法币贬值得更快，物价涨得更快，原来生活比较优越的教授们，这时候，也和广大人民一样，活不下去了。特别是家口众多的人，生活更为困难。
    国民党政府也知道人民的怨恨，特别是在高等学校的知识分子也对这种情况忍受不下去了，便耍了一个手法，发了一种配购证，可以用较低的价格，买到“美援的面粉”。
    也正当这个时候，美国政府积极扶助日本，美国驻华大使司徒雷登对中国人民发出诬蔑和侮辱的叫嚣。
    一面是廉价收买，一面是扶植日本，侮辱中国人民。我们一些人商量了一下，要揭穿国民党政府的阴谋，抗议美国政府的侮辱，发表一个公开声明。声明是这样的：
    为反对美国政府的扶日政策，为抗议上海美国总领事卡宝德和美国驻华大使司徒雷登对中国人民的诬蔑和侮辱，为表示中国人民的尊严和气节，我们断然拒绝美国具有收买灵魂性质的一切施舍物资，无论是购买的或给与的。下列同人同意拒绝购买美援平价面粉，一致退还配购证，特此声明。
            三十七年六月十七日
    声明写好了，要征集签名，也和往常一样，决定每人负责联系若干人，年纪大一点的教授多半是归我跑腿的。我拿着稿子去找朱自清先生。
    这时候，他的胃病已经很沉重了，只能吃很少的东西，多一点就要吐。面庞瘦削，说话声音低沉。他有大大小小七个孩子，日子比谁过得都困难。但是他一看了稿子，毫不迟疑，立刻签了名。他向来写字是规规矩矩的，这次，他还是用颤动的手，一笔不苟地签上他的名字。
    于此，也应该交代一笔，1946年从昆明回到清华园以后，他的态度有了显著的改变，不再沉默了。他反对内战，讨厌国民党。对共产党的看法也开始改变了，他曾在公开集会上朗诵解放区的诗歌，有时候还和学生们一起化装扭秧歌，弄得满头是汗。在反对美国反对国民党的一些宣言、通电、声明等等的斗争中，我总是找他。他一看见我，也就明白来意，“是签名的吧？”看了稿子，就写上自己的名字。就我记忆所及，大概十次中有八九次他是签名的。也有不签的时候，原因是文字的火气大了一些。
    这次，我也曾找了另外一些教授，都是平时比较熟的，或是住在附近的，大多数签了名。但也碰过钉子。有个教授只有三个孩子，但他的答复很干脆：“不！我还要活！”
    他的胃病是饿出来的，人口多，要养活。在昆明的后期，有人算过账，我们这类人的薪水，折合战前的银元，大约只有十几元钱。
    他对政治是关心的，但不大发表意见。要说，也是温文尔雅，没有火气。抗战时期，消息被国民党封锁了，对于国民党对日本帝国主义消极抗战，对共产党却积极磨擦，掀起几次反共高潮的真实情况，大后方的人们是不清楚的。他认为只要抵抗，生活过得苦一些也应该，很少发牢骚。昆明的许多政治活动，他虽然同情，但很少参加。到了国民党反动派暗杀了闻一多，他感到极大愤慨。复员回到北平以后，又看到美帝国主义帮助国民党发动内战，大打特打，他的态度变了，在美国帝国主义者及其走狗国民党反动派面前站起来了，除了很少几次的例外，他参加到我们的行列里来了。
    有几件事值得提出，一件是他对编纂《闻一多全集》的努力，我在全集的跋文中曾指出：
    佩弦先生是一多十几年来的老友和同事，为了这部书，他花费了一年的时间，搜集遗文，编缀校正。拟定了目录……一句话，没有佩弦先生的劳力和主持，这集子是不可能编集的。
    在当时，编印一多全集这一举动，就是对国民党反动派的抗议和谴责。相反，和有些人相比，这些人曾经是一多的同班或者旧时同学，有二三十年的交谊，但在一多死后，却从来没有关心过这件事，也没有写一篇纪念的文字。
    另一件是他对青年学生的爱护。举一个例子，有一回他系里两个学生打架，一个是民主青年同盟的，一个是国民党三青团的。打架的原因当然是政治性的，两人都到老师面前告状。自清先生怕民青这位同学吃亏，背地里劝他让一点。我在知道这件事情以后，便写一封信提出意见，请他要考虑政治上谁对谁不对，大概措辞的口气尖锐了一些，第二天他就到我家里来了，非常认真严肃地说明他的用意，春秋责备贤者，他说了进步的学生几句，目的是为了保护他，免遭三青团的报复。同时，他也同意我的意见是正确的。事后我把这情况告诉了民青的同学，这个同学也很感动。
    他对国民党特务统治的反对，虽然没有大声疾呼，却也可以从我亲身接触的一件事看出来。这时候，国民党反动派为了挽救濒于灭亡的命运，加强了对高等学校的特务控制。为了抗议，我写了一篇学术论文《明初的学校》，说的是明初，骂的是国民党反动派，送给学校刊物《清华学报》发表，学报的编辑有些是国民党员，他们当然不肯发表，认为这不算学术性文章。我和自清先生谈起，他也是学报的编辑委员，极力主张发表，写信给主编，终于发表了这篇文章。从这件事，可以看出他的思想感情的变化，他变了。由于他被胃病长期折磨，身体过度衰弱，但他也明白天快亮了，乌云就要过去了，好日子要来到了。他感到欣慰，在自己的书桌上玻璃板下，写下两句诗：“但得夕阳无限好，何须惆怅近黄昏？”这两句诗十分恰切地表达了他晚年的心情。
    七月二十三日在清华大学工字厅举行“知识分子今天的任务”的座谈会，这是他最后一次参加的政治活动。我亲自到他家请他，和他一起慢步从北院走到工字厅。他走一会儿，停一会儿，断断续续地对我说：“你们是对的，道路走对了。不过，像我这样人，还不大习惯，要教育我们，得慢慢地来。这样就跟上你们了。”开会时他也发了言，主要一段话也还是这个意思，他说：“知识分子的道路有两条：一条是帮凶帮闲，向上爬的，封建社会和资本主义社会都有这种人。一条是向下的。知识分子是可上可下的，所以是一个阶层而不是一个阶级。要许多知识分子都丢开既得利益，是不容易的事。现在我们过群众生活还过不来。这也不是理性上不愿意接受，理性是知道应该接受的，是习惯上变不过来。
    自清先生在理性上知道要丢开既得利益，要过群众生活，他又进了一步了，这是大踏步前进的一步。
    他拒绝购买美援面粉，在签了名以后，这天的日记记了这件事：
    六月十八日，此事每月须损失六百万法币，影响家中甚大，但余仍决定签名。因余等既反美扶日，自应直接由己身做起。
    由此可以看出他的决心。不止如此，在逝世前一天，他还告诉他的夫人：“有一件事得记住，我是在拒绝美援面粉的文件上签过名的！”
    自清先生是旧时代知识分子中的典型人物，他曾经是自由主义者，他不大喜欢参加政治活动，特别是比较激烈、斗争性较强的政治活动。但是，他具有正义感，随着国民党和美帝国主义对中国人民奴役、压迫的加强，和向中国人民的武装挑衅屠杀、镇压，他毕竟忍受不住了。他说话了，行动了，通过文化生活、朗诵诗歌和扭秧歌，表明了他的态度。另一面，他坚决不走中间路线，第三条道路，当时有人要他参加国民党办的中间路线刊物
  “新路”，他坚决地拒绝了。但是他却带病参加了我们的座谈会。
  他明辨是非，爱憎分明，在衰病的晚年，终于有了明确的立场，抬起头来，挺起脊梁，宁肯饿死，坚决拒绝敌人的“救济”，这种品德，这种气节，是值得我们今天学习的。
    “我们中国人是有骨气的。许多曾经是自由主义者或民主个人主义者的人们，在美国帝国主义者及其走狗国民党反动派面前站起来了。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷1499页）毛泽东同志赞扬了闻一多、朱自清的骨气，说“应当写闻一多颂，写朱自清颂”，这是我们未死者、特别是一多先生和自清先生生前战友的责任。这种表现我们民族的英雄气概的颂歌，还有待于未来。这一篇文字，只能算是重读《别了，司徒雷登》一文所引起的一些回忆罢了。
