Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 16th: The Jiao coal producing areas of Shuangyashan, Hegang, Jixi and Boli in Heilongjiang Province are vigorously transferring more and better Jiao coal to support key steel enterprises across the country. Currently, thousands of train cars full of high-quality Jiao coal are departing from these mining areas every day, heading to key steel enterprises in Anshan, Benxi, Shanghai and other places.

Since the beginning of November, the First Secretaries of the Communist Party Committees of Shuangyashan, Hegang, Jixi and Boli cities and counties have personally taken charge and vigorously promoted coal transportation work. Liang Chengyi, the First Secretary of the Hegang Municipal Party Committee, and all members of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee, went deep into the mines to help formulate measures for high production and increased transportation, and to specifically solve various problems in the loading and transportation process, greatly accelerating the speed of coal transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 16th: Workers in various coal washing plants in Liaoning Province are actively devising ways to select more high-quality Jiao coal to support Anshan Iron and Steel. The Fushun Longfeng Mine Coal Washing Plant is constantly innovating operations and improving equipment, making the output and quality of coking coal steadily improve. In order to support Anshan Iron and Steel, the Taiji Mine Coal Washing Plant of the Beipiao Mining Bureau, without reducing the amount of coal washed in its own mine and without increasing equipment or manpower, washed and selected some Jiao coal from the Jingxing Coal Mine, and was able to send one more train car loaded with high-quality Jiao coal directly to Anshan Iron and Steel every day. In the past, the Lingshan Coal Washing Plant workers only selected one type of coal, but recently they changed to selecting multiple types of coal, so that whatever coal Anshan Iron and Steel needs, they wash that coal.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 17th: Wuhan City is vigorously carrying out the work of clearing warehouses and utilizing waste products. According to incomplete statistics, in just ten days in mid-October, the city recovered more than 41,000 tons of scrap steel and iron from warehouse clearing, a large portion of which has been allocated to Wuhan Iron and Steel and other key factories and mines to support increased steel production.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, November 16th: Twenty-four machinery manufacturing units in Weifang City, Shandong Province, have formed a joint collaboration group to support steel production and have linked up with seven steel plants. Since October, these units have produced 84 sets of raw material processing machinery for the steel plants, such as mineral powder washing machines, raw material mixing machines, and counter-roller crushers; at the same time, they have produced a large number of accessories to ensure the normal operation of the equipment in the steel plants.

After the various machinery units in the city formed a joint support steel collaboration group, they adjusted raw materials with each other and shared resources; when manufacturing machinery and equipment, if one factory could not manufacture it, several factories jointly manufactured it, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of support work.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 16th: Employees of the Chongqing Water Transportation Company have established a sense of the overall situation to ensure the timely supply of raw materials and fuels needed by key steel plants.

The Party Committee of the company transferred more than 90% of its cadres to the places with the most transportation of key materials and the most difficult transportation conditions, and worked with the workers to study measures to ensure the materials needed for high steel production were completed. Therefore, the employees were full of energy and vigorously engaged in more towing and more trips, overcoming difficulties, and transporting large quantities of coal, coke, pig iron and refractory materials to the steel plants. In August of this year, Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant urgently needed a batch of ferromanganese ore, but the manganese ore parked at the Chaotianmen Wharf could not be shipped out because there were no tugboats to tow it. When the crew of the No. 209 passenger boat learned about this, they immediately volunteered to add a wooden boat to be towed, and delivered the manganese ore on time, meeting the urgent needs of the steel plant.

The company has also fixed five tugboats with sufficient horsepower and complete equipment and a fleet with a transport capacity of more than 8,800 tons, compiled into a red flag fleet to ensure high steel production, specializing in transporting coal, coke, pig iron and other materials for the steel plants. The company also equipped on-site dispatchers at major steel plants and key wharves to understand and master the amount and reserves of coal, coke, and pig iron needed by each steel plant every day, and to do a good job in on-site dispatching.

Now, the dry season of the Yangtze River and Jialing River is about to begin. In order to supply the raw materials and fuels for steel production in a timely manner during the dry season, the entire company has launched a mass movement of "small boats topping big boats, old boats topping new boats, new boats are new every day, and one boat tops several boats" for ship type reform, and the company has also arranged more than 30 motor boats to participate in the transportation work during the dry season.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 17th: Employees of the Shenyang Fan Factory adopted the method of "five priorities, one non-concession" to concentrate superior forces and actively rush to manufacture equipment for Anshan Iron and Steel. By the beginning of November, the factory had completed more than 94% of Anshan Iron and Steel's entire order for this year.

The factory gives priority to ensuring that Anshan Iron and Steel's various fan orders do not fall behind in the planned progress in the five aspects of planning arrangements, equipment, manpower, transportation, and materials. For example, the six large boiler blowers and induced draft fans customized by Anshan Iron and Steel were originally planned to be produced in the third quarter; when they learned that Anshan Iron and Steel was in urgent need, they re-arranged the plan and rushed to manufacture this batch of orders from Anshan Iron and Steel ahead of schedule. In October, the factory rushed to produce 30 CT-Д type fans that were originally planned to be produced in November to support Anshan Iron and Steel.

    四方物资源源汇集钢铁厂
    据新华社哈尔滨16日电　黑龙江省双鸭山、鹤岗、鸡西和勃利等焦煤产地正在大力调运更多更好的焦煤支援全国各重点钢铁企业。现在，每天都有上千个车皮满载着优质焦煤，从这些矿区开往鞍山、本溪、上海等地的重点钢铁企业。
    进入11月份以来，中共双鸭山、鹤岗、鸡西和勃利市和县的第一书记，都亲自挂帅，大力抓煤炭运输工作。鹤岗市委第一书记梁成义和市委各常委，都深入各矿，帮助制订高产多运措施，具体解决装运过程中的各种问题。使运煤速度大大加快。
  据新华社沈阳16日电　辽宁省各洗煤厂职工积极想办法多选优质焦煤支援鞍钢。抚顺龙凤矿洗煤厂不断革新操作，改进设备，使炼焦精煤产量、质量蒸蒸日上。北票矿务局台吉矿洗煤厂为了支援鞍钢，在不减少本矿洗煤数量和不增加设备、人力的情况下，洗选了一部分井陉煤矿的焦煤，每天能够多开一列装载优质焦煤的货车直达鞍钢。灵山洗煤厂职工过去只选一种煤，最近他们改为选多种煤，做到鞍钢需要什么煤就洗什么煤。
    据新华社武汉17日电　武汉市大力开展清仓、利用废品的工作。据不完全统计，仅10月中旬十天的时间，全市从清仓中回收的废钢废铁就达四万一千多吨，其中很大部分已调拨给武钢等重点厂矿，支援炼钢增产。
    新华社济南16日电　山东省潍坊市二十四个机械制造单位组成支援钢铁生产联合协作小组，同七个钢铁厂挂上钩。从10月份以来，这些单位已经为各钢铁厂生产了矿粉水洗机、原料搅拌机、对滚粉碎机等原料加工机械八十四部；同时生产了大批配件，保证了各钢铁厂设备正常运转的需要。
    这个市的各机械单位组成联合支援钢铁协作小组以后，在原料方面彼此调剂，互通有无；在制造机器设备时，一厂不能制造，就数厂联合起来共同制造，从而保证了支援工作的顺利进行。
    据新华社重庆16日电　重庆水上运输公司职工树立全局观点，保证重点钢厂需要的原料燃料得到及时供应。
    这个公司的党委抽调了90％以上的干部，深入到运输重点物资最多、运输条件最艰巨的地方，和工人一起研究保证完成钢铁高产所需物资的措施。因此，职工干劲十足，纷纷大搞多拖多跑，战胜困难，把大批煤、焦、生铁和耐火材料运往钢厂。今年8月间重庆第三钢铁厂急需一批锰铁矿，而朝天门码头上停放的锰矿却因没有拖轮拖带发运不出去。这件事被二○九号小客轮的船员们知道了，他们立即自告奋勇增加拖带一只木船，按时载去了锰矿，满足了钢厂的急需。
    这个公司还固定了马力足、设备齐整的五只拖轮和八千八百多吨运量的船队，编成保证钢铁高产红旗船队，专门给各钢厂运输煤、焦、生铁等物资。公司还在各大型钢厂和重点码头配备了现场调度人员，每天了解掌握各钢厂需要煤、焦、生铁的数量和储备量，作好现场调运工作。
    现在，长江和嘉陵江的枯水期即将开始。为了在枯水季节及时供应钢铁生产的原料和燃料，全公司又掀起了一个“小船顶大船，旧船顶新船，新船日日新，一船顶数船”的船型改革的群众运动，公司还安排了三十多只内燃机船参加枯水季的运输工作。
    据新华社沈阳17日电　沈阳扇风机厂职工采用“五优先、一不让”的办法，集中优势力量积极为鞍钢赶制设备。到11月初，这个厂已完成鞍钢今年全部定货的94％以上。
    这个厂对鞍钢所需的各种风机定货，在计划安排、设备、人力、运输和材料等五方面，都优先保证不让鞍钢产品在计划进度上拖后。例如鞍钢定制的六台大型锅炉鼓风机和引风机，原来计划排在三季度生产；当他们了解到鞍钢急需时，就重新编排了计划，把鞍钢的这批定货提前赶制。在10月份，这个厂又把原计划11月生产的三十台CT—Д型风机，提前赶制出来，支援了鞍钢。
