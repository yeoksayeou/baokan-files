This newspaper reports: Recently, newspapers of the Yugoslav Tito group have continuously published a series of articles distorting the truth about Cuba, slandering the policies of the Cuban government, exaggerating the so-called "chaos" and "difficulties" in Cuba, shamelessly defending the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism, and viciously provoking relations between Cuba and socialist countries.

The "Politika" published an article on October 23 entitled "Clouds on the Island," depicting the current situation in Cuba as pitch black. The author deliberately obliterated the great achievements made by the Cuban people in consolidating the revolution and developing the economy, as well as their heroic spirit and revolutionary spirit in overcoming all difficulties, and talked about what "the difficulties facing the Cuban revolution are increasing," "economic difficulties and the intensification of relations around Cuba itself have created a series of new difficulties." This article even attacked Cuba's nationalization policy as being implemented "too quickly" and threatened that "Cuba's economic problems will become more complicated and the situation will be more bleak in the coming months." The author of the article also used the voice of religious forces to slander the "increasingly serious communist infiltration in the Cuban leadership" and the so-called "destruction of Cuban democracy."

"Borba" echoed this on November 6 in an article entitled "The Stage of 'Peace and People's Security' in Cuba," attacking the Cuban government's policies as "too hasty," saying that this policy began to produce "a certain atmosphere of unease, which is not conducive to the constant calls for maintaining the unity of the majority of the people here." This article desperately exaggerated the economic difficulties caused by the American embargo to Cuba. The author deliberately exaggerated the rebellious activities of Cuban counter-revolutionaries, portrayed Cuba as a scene of chaos and unease, and ridiculed Cuba for not having "peace and people's security" in a gloating tone.

A "Cuban Dispatch" published by this newspaper on November 8 more blatantly supported the American master, saying that Cuba would encounter "greater difficulties" if it lost "American aid," and that "the situation is very serious." It wrote: The Cuban government "has taken certain measures to alleviate the economic blockade by importing from other countries, but even so, difficulties cannot be avoided." It also said groundlessly that "Cubans know that relying on imports from countries that suggest replacing the American market with their own market cannot completely solve the problem." This dispatch attempted to lead people to the conclusion that it is impossible for the Cuban people to have any way out without succumbing to American economic pressure.

An article titled "Brazilian Dispatch" published in "Borba" on November 11, on the other hand, intimidated the Cuban people from another angle, saying that the Brazilian "social strata, which can be called the center of citizens, are unhappy to see Cuba's nationalization policy. They believe that Castro does not need to isolate himself from other governments in Latin America. They also sharply criticize him for unnecessarily intensifying relations with the United States." However, the author of this dispatch could not but admit that the United States' attempt to "isolate" Cuba had failed. He sighed that the United States' "high-pressure" tactics against Cuba "at most, produced suspicion of American policies and an increase in the openly 'anti-Yankee' sentiment." The "International Politics" bi-monthly published an article on November 1 entitled "Cuba Under the American Embargo," which even completely revealed the face of a lackey, lamenting that the American embargo measures were not worth the loss, saying that "it will inevitably force Cuba to link more firmly with the East economically." At the same time, it viciously provoked relations between Cuba and socialist countries, nonsensically saying that Cuba's development of friendly relations with socialist countries was "contrary to its own intentions and interests," and slandered Cuba as "becoming the object of group policies and bringing all the unfortunate consequences arising therefrom."

The Tito group has always pretended to sympathize with and support national independence movements, but whenever the struggle of various countries to strive for and maintain national independence reaches a critical juncture, the Tito group always comes out to support imperialism, attempting to shake, undermine, and weaken the struggles of the people of various countries. The above series of articles once again exposed the shameful face of the Tito group, a gang of modern revisionists, as loyal servants of imperialism.

    露出一付帝国主义走狗的嘴脸
    铁托集团报刊大肆诬蔑古巴革命
    恶毒攻击古巴政府政策多方恐吓古巴人民
    本报讯　最近一个时期，南斯拉夫铁托集团的报刊连续发表一系列歪曲古巴真相的文章，诬蔑古巴政府的政策，大肆渲染古巴国内的所谓
  “混乱”和“困难”，无耻地为美帝国主义的侵略政策辩解，并恶毒地挑拨古巴和社会主义国家的关系。
    “政治报”10月23日发表一篇题为“岛上的阴云”的文章，把古巴的现状写成漆黑一团。作者故意抹煞古巴人民在巩固革命和发展经济方面所取得的巨大成就，以及他们战胜一切困难的英雄气概和革命精神，而大谈什么“古巴革命所面临的困难日益增长”，“经济困难和古巴本身及其周围的关系尖锐化，造成了一系列新的困难”。这篇文章居然攻击古巴实行国有化政策
  “速度太快”，并且恐吓说“今后数月中古巴的经济问题将更复杂，情况将更惨淡”。文章的作者还借宗教势力之口，诬蔑“古巴领导机构中愈益严重的共产主义渗透”和所谓“古巴民主的复灭”。
    “战斗报”11月6日在一篇题为“在古巴‘和平和人民安全’的阶段”的文章中对此加以唱和，攻击古巴政府的政策“操之过急”，说什么这种政策开始产生“某种不安的气氛，这是不利于这里不断呼吁的维护大多数人民的团结的”。这篇文章拼命夸大美国禁运给古巴造成的经济困难。作者故意渲染古巴反革命分子的暴乱活动，把古巴描绘成一片混乱和不安，而用幸灾乐祸的口吻嘲讽古巴没有“和平和人民安全”。
    这家报纸11月8日发表的一篇“古巴通讯”，更露骨地为美国主子帮腔，说什么古巴失掉“美援”，将会遇到“更大的困难”，“情况非常严重”，它写道：古巴政府“采取了某些措施，通过从其他国家进口来缓和经济封锁，但是尽管如此，困难还不能避免”，它还毫无根据地说什么：“古巴人知道，依靠从那些向古巴建议以自己的市场来代替美国市场的国家的进口，不能彻底地解决问题”。这篇通讯企图使人得出这样的结论：古巴人民不向美国的经济压力屈服，是不可能有任何出路的。
    “战斗报”11月11日发表的一篇“巴西通讯”，则从另外一个角度来对古巴人民进行威吓，说什么巴西“可以被称为公民中心的社会阶层”“不乐于看到古巴的国有化政策。他们认为卡斯特罗没有必要与拉丁美洲的其他政府孤立起来。他们也尖锐地指责他不必要地加剧同美国的关系。”但是这篇通讯的作者却不能不承认美国企图“孤立”古巴未能得逞，他叹息美国对古巴的“高压”手段，“最多的是，产生了对美国政策的怀疑和公开‘反对美国佬’的情绪的增长”。“国际政策”半月刊11月1日发表的题为“在美国禁运下的古巴”一文，甚至完全露出奴才的嘴脸，哀叹美国的禁运措施得不偿失，说“它将不可避免地迫使古巴在经济上更巩固地同东方联结起来。”同时它恶毒地挑拨古巴与社会主义国家的关系，胡说古巴同社会主义国家发展友好关系是“违背自己的意图和利益”的，诬蔑古巴“成为集团政策的对象，并带来由此产生的一切不幸的后果”。
    铁托集团一向假装是同情和支持民族独立运动的，但是每当各国争取和维护民族独立的斗争到了紧要的关头，铁托集团就总是要出来为帝国主义帮腔，企图动摇、破坏和削弱各国人民的斗争。上述的一系列文章再一次暴露了铁托集团一帮现代修正主义者是帝国主义忠实奴仆的可耻面目。
