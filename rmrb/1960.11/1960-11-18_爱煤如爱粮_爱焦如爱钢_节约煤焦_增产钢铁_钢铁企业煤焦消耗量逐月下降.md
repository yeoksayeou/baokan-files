Love Coal as You Love Grain, Love Coke as You Love Steel, Conserve Coal and Coke, Increase Steel Production
Steel Enterprises' Coal and Coke Consumption Decreases Month by Month

    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The mass movement to conserve raw coal and coke in steel enterprises across the country has achieved significant results. For several months, on the basis of high and quality pig iron production, the consumption of coal and coke has gradually decreased. According to statistics from relevant departments, the average coke consumption per ton of pig iron produced by small and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide in September decreased by 110 kilograms compared to August, and in October it decreased by about 50 kilograms compared to September. Due to the reduction in coke consumption, the six provinces of Hebei, Henan, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang alone used nearly 400,000 tons less coking coal in one month. The coke produced from these raw coal could produce more than 100,000 tons of pig iron.
    In the increase production and conservation movement, steel enterprises in various regions have put forward the slogan "Love coal as you love grain, love coke as you love steel," and have tightly controlled all aspects of transportation, use, and storage, trying every possible means to reduce the loss of coke and raw coal. For example, workers at the Xiaohainan Iron Smelting Plant in Ba County, Chongqing, universally launched a one-stop competition from coking, loading and unloading, transportation, and crushing to iron smelting. Transportation workers ensured that people and animals did not crush the coke, crushing workers changed their sledgehammers to eagle-beak hammers, gently tapping and chiseling according to the coke's texture, and coking workers achieved the guarantee conditions of no black heads at the bottom of the kiln and no foamed coke on the top of the kiln, increasing the coke's coking rate from the original 60% to over 75%, reducing the loss rate by 10%, and reducing the iron smelting coke ratio by more than 600 kilograms compared to the beginning of the year. Workers at steel enterprises in Handan City enthusiastically launched a competition of "two highs" (high recovery rate, high coking rate) and "four picks" (picking coking coal in the kiln, on the road, in the ash, and at the station), saving more than 45,000 tons of coke in fifty days.
    While carrying out competitions, steel enterprises in various regions have established and improved various management and technical measures. Hebei Province has universally promoted the "fixed quota contracting" system for coal and coke supply created by Shijiazhuang City, ensuring that the plan for conserving coke and coal is implemented from the city down to each coke oven and blast furnace. Zhangjiakou City, which has promoted the system the best, has reduced the coke consumption per ton of iron by 17% compared to before the implementation of "fixed quota contracting."
    Implementing the technical operating principles of refined materials, strong blast, and high temperature in iron smelting blast furnaces is another important measure to reduce coal consumption. To this end, many places have carried out technical transformations of small and medium-sized blast furnaces, universally increasing the blast temperature and pressure, and strengthening the washing and sintering of ore. For example, iron smelting enterprises in Jinan City, Shandong Province, stipulate that all raw materials entering the furnace must meet seven standards, including high ore grade, small and uniform particle size, strong self-fluxing properties, and accurate laboratory analysis and batching. As a result, not only have many small blast furnaces reduced the coke ratio, but they have also improved the utilization coefficient and the quality of pig iron. Among them, the small blast furnaces of Jinan Textile Factory and other enterprises consume no more than 600 kilograms of coke per ton of iron.

### 爱煤如爱粮　爱焦如爱钢　节约煤焦　增产钢铁  钢铁企业煤焦消耗量逐月下降

    爱煤如爱粮　爱焦如爱钢　节约煤焦　增产钢铁
    钢铁企业煤焦消耗量逐月下降
    据新华社17日讯　各地钢铁企业节约原煤、焦炭的群众运动，已经取得显著成就；几个月来在生铁高产优质的基础上，煤、焦消耗量逐步下降。据有关部门统计，9月份全国中小高炉平均每产一吨生铁耗用的焦炭，比8月份减少了一百一十公斤，10月份又比9月份少用了五十公斤左右。由于焦炭消耗降低，只是河北、河南、湖南、安徽、江西、浙江六省，一个月就少用将近四十万吨炼焦煤，用这些原煤炼出的焦炭可以多炼十多万吨生铁。
    各地钢铁企业在增产节约运动中，都提出了“爱煤如爱粮，爱焦如爱钢”的口号，紧紧把住运输、使用、保管等各个关口，千方百计地减少焦炭和原煤的损耗。如重庆巴县小海南炼铁厂职工，从炼焦、装卸、运输、破碎，直到炼铁，普遍开展了一条龙的竞赛。运输工人做到人畜不压焦炭，破碎工人将大锤改成了鹰嘴锤，根据焦炭纹路轻打轻凿，炼焦工人实现了窑底无黑头、窑上无泡焦的保证条件，使焦炭的结焦率从原来的60％多提高到75％，损耗率降低了10％，炼铁焦比也比年初下降了六百多公斤。邯郸市各钢铁企业职工热烈开展了二高（回收率高、结焦率高）、四拣（窑里、路上、灰里、站上拣焦煤）的竞赛活动，五十天就节约了四万五千多吨焦炭。
    在开展竞赛的同时，各地钢铁企业建立和健全了各项管理工作和技术措施。河北省普遍推广了石家庄市创造的煤、焦供应“定额包干”的制度，使节约焦、煤的计划从市一直落实到每座焦炉和高炉，其中推广得最好的张家口市，每吨铁消耗的焦炭已比实行“定额包干”前下降了17％。
    炼铁高炉上贯彻精料、大风、高温的技术操作方针，是减少煤耗的另一项重要措施。很多地方为此对中小高炉进行了技术改造，普遍提高了风温风压，还加强了矿石的洗选和烧结工作。如山东省济南市各炼铁企业规定所有入炉原料都要达到矿石品位高，粒度小而均匀，自熔性强，化验配料准确等七项标准，结果不但许多小高炉降低了焦比，还提高了利用系数和生铁质量。其中济南织布厂等企业的小高炉，每炼一吨铁的焦炭耗量，都不超过六百公斤。
