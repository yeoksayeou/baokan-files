	Lychee Cannon

	In the turbulent year of 1927, as the red flag of Jinggang Mountain waved, a red storm swept across the country. This wooden cannon was the heroic weapon used by the people of Hainan Island in their revolution.

	The Hainan peasant Red Guard members, fighting alongside the Red Army, wielded knives, spears, and homemade guns, but they greatly desired a cannon to amplify the revolution's momentum. Han Jinzhun, a carpenter and Communist Party member from Wengtian Township, Wenchang County, and the Red Guard members used lychee wood, a specialty of Hainan, to create a "Lychee Cannon." This cannon could hold two jin of iron filings and more than three jin of gunpowder each time, and could be fired once a fuse was lit. The Red Guard members used this cannon in coordination with the Red Army in countless fierce battles, annihilating many enemies. (Xiao Bai)

    荔枝炮
    动荡的一九二七年，当井冈山的红旗招展的时候，红色的风暴席卷全国。这门木制大炮，就是当年海南岛人民闹革命的英雄武器。
    跟红军并肩作战的海南农民赤卫队员们，手拿刀、矛和土枪，但他们非常想要一门大炮，来壮大革命的声势。文昌县翁田乡木工共产党员韩今准，和赤卫队员们用海南特产的荔枝木，造出了一门“荔枝炮”，这炮每次可装两斤铁砂、三斤多粉药，装上导火线就可发射。赤卫队员用这门炮配合红军参加过无数次激烈战斗，歼灭了许多敌人。（晓白）
