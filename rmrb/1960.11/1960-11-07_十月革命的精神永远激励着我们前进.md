    The Spirit of the October Revolution Will Always Inspire Us to Advance
    Zhao Zongkun, Youth Blast Furnace Worker, Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company

    With the sound of the October Revolution, the world's first socialist state—the Soviet Union—was born. It illuminated the path forward for the exploited and oppressed people of the world. Today, the world is celebrating this glorious festival of the world's proletariat and working people. As a liberated Chinese worker, our excited feelings are as boiling as molten steel. At this moment, my heart yearns for the great Soviet people, for the great revolutionary teacher Lenin, and for the great October revolutionary struggle.

    I have watched the film "In the Name of the Revolution," and the movie of the Red Army soldiers attacking the Winter Palace. The glorious image of Comrade Lenin often appears before my eyes. Under the guidance of Comrade Lenin's revolutionary spirit, the Soviet working class and working people, with heroic and tenacious struggle, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Tsar and established the world's first proletarian dictatorship. For forty-three years, they have built the Soviet Union into the world's leading powerful industrial country with their hardworking hands. Today, Comrade Lenin's revolutionary spirit is surging throughout the world. A great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has formed in the world, and the national liberation movement in colonies and semi-colonies is rising unprecedentedly. Imperialism is collapsing day by day. We are in an era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. Thinking about the past, looking at the present, and looking forward to the future, I feel extremely excited and encouraged. We will never forget Comrade Lenin's revolutionary spirit; we must always cherish it, defend it, and carry it forward.

    Decades ago, Lenin advocated the "Communist Voluntary Saturday" system. Today, the Soviet working class has vigorously launched the "Communist Labor Team" movement throughout the country. Under the slogan of "working, studying, and living in a communist way," more than seven million people in the Soviet Union have participated in the movement. The Soviet working class has carried forward this communist spirit taught by Lenin, which makes me feel heartfelt joy and admiration.

    Many of our young blast furnace workers have smelted iron with Soviet comrades. Since our blast furnace came into the hands of the people, Soviet experts have given us excellent technical guidance. Soviet worker elder brothers have also come to our furnace to demonstrate ironmaking operations. Their proletarian internationalist spirit has left a deep impression on my heart. With the help of Soviet comrades, we have mastered new technologies in blast furnace smelting, such as steam blowing and ore grading into the furnace, which has rapidly improved our production level. Now the daily output of pig iron from the blast furnace has exceeded three times the design capacity, and recently it has reached a new peak. We are forever grateful for the assistance of the Soviet people.

    The employees of our Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the great leader Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, are building our country at a rapid pace. The three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune are the guiding lights for our brilliant victories. We once built a converter steelmaking workshop with an annual output of 100,000 tons in fourteen days with our own hands. Now we are rapidly mastering the technology of smelting various alloy steels. Since the beginning of this year, we have launched a widespread and in-depth red flag competition movement. The output of steel and iron in the first ten months has increased a lot compared with the same period last year. This is the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, and also the victory of Leninism.

    The people of China and the Soviet Union have formed a close and unbreakable friendship in the long struggle of revolution and construction under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. Let us always unite closely, hold high the victorious banner of the October Revolution, and advance towards even greater victories.

    十月革命的精神永远激励着我们前进
    北京石景山钢铁公司青年高炉工人　赵宗昆
    十月革命一声炮响，诞生了世界上第一个社会主义国家——苏联，它给全世界被剥削被压迫的人民照亮了前进的道路，今天举世在欢庆这个全世界无产阶级和劳动人民的光辉节日，作为一个获得了解放的中国工人，我们激动的心情，像钢水一样沸腾，此刻我的心向往着伟大的苏联人民，向往着伟大的革命导师列宁，向往着伟大十月的革命斗争。
    我看过影片“以革命的名义”，看过红军战士攻打冬宫的电影，列宁同志的光辉形象，经常浮现在我的眼前，在列宁同志革命精神的教导下，苏联工人阶级和劳动人民以英勇顽强的斗争，推翻了沙皇的反动统治，建立了世界上第一个无产阶级专政的国家，四十三年来，他们以勤劳的双手把苏联建设成世界上第一等的强大的工业国家。今天列宁同志的革命精神已经磅礴于全世界。世界上已形成了以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营，殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动空前高涨，帝国主义正在一天天走向崩溃，我们正处在东风压倒西风的时代。想想过去，看看现在，瞻望将来，我感到极大的兴奋和鼓舞，我们决不会忘记列宁同志的革命精神，我们要永远珍惜它、保卫它、发扬它。
    数十年前，列宁就提倡过“共产主义义务星期六”的制度，今天苏联的工人阶级在全国各地又蓬勃地开展了“共产主义劳动队”运动，在按“共产主义方式劳动、学习和生活的”口号下，苏联已有七百多万人参加到运动中来，苏联的工人阶级发扬了列宁教导的这种共产主义精神，使我感到由衷的高兴和敬佩。
    我们青年高炉的许多工人都和苏联同志在一起炼过铁。我们这座高炉自从掌握到人民手里以来，苏联专家曾经在技术上给过我们精湛的指导。苏联工人老大哥也到我们炉子上来表演过炼铁操作，他们的无产阶级国际主义精神，在我的心里留下了深刻的印象。在苏联同志的帮助下，我们掌握了蒸汽鼓风、矿石分级入炉等高炉冶炼的新技术，迅速地提高了生产水平，现在高炉的生铁日产量已超过设计能力的三倍以上，最近以来，更达到了一个新的高峰。我们对于苏联人民的援助是永远感激的。
    我们石景山钢铁公司的职工和全国人民一道在伟大的领袖毛泽东和中国共产党的领导下，正在一日千里地建设我们的国家。总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗是我们取得辉煌胜利的指路明灯，我们曾经用自己的双手在十四天的时间里，建成了一座年产十万吨的转炉炼钢车间。现在我们正在迅速地掌握冶炼多种合金钢的技术，今年以来，我们掀起了广泛深入的红旗竞赛运动。头十个月钢和铁的产量，比去年同期增长了很多。这是总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利，也是列宁主义的胜利。
    我们中国和苏联两国人民在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，在革命和建设的长期斗争中结成了亲密的牢不可破的友谊，让我们永远紧密地团结在一起，高举十月革命的胜利旗帜，向着更加伟大的胜利前进。
