Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 22nd. The National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic recently passed the law on the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) for the development of the national economy at its fourth session.  Simunek, Czechoslovak Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Planning Commission, delivered a report to the parliament on this issue.

The reporter said that the Third Five-Year Plan stipulates that national income will increase by more than 42%. The proportion of the means of production in the total social product will increase from 58.6% in 1960 to 60.7% in 1965.

In the next five years, priority will still be given to the development of the machinery manufacturing industry, especially heavy machinery. The production of machinery will increase by more than 76%. The chemical industry will also experience significant development, with 130 large-scale projects to be carried out in five years.

When discussing the tasks of the power and fuel industries, Simunek pointed out that the main focus will be on mining coking coal in the Ostrava-Karvina coal mining area. The amount of coal produced using combined coal mining machines will double, accounting for about half of the total output there.

During the Third Five-Year Plan, in order to change the face of agricultural production, it is necessary to accelerate the supply of machines, mineral fertilizers, and chemical fertilizers, expand soil improvement work, and adopt new technologies. It is necessary to continuously reduce agricultural production costs. By 1965, agricultural production costs should be reduced by 11%. During the Third Five-Year Plan, all basic work in agriculture will be mechanized.

When discussing basic construction, Simunek said that the scale of basic construction during the Third Five-Year Plan is very large, with investment reaching 322 billion crowns, which is more than the total investment in the past ten years. The Third Five-Year Plan also stipulates that labor productivity will increase by 43% in industry, 54% in construction, and at least 53% in agriculture.

Simunek said that it is expected that the economic levels of Slovakia and the Czech regions will converge before long during the Third Five-Year Plan. He pointed out that the total industrial output value of the Slovak region will increase by 84% by 1965.

    捷议会通过第三个五年计划法案
    将优先发展机械工业增加基本建设投资加速农业机械化
    新华社布拉格22日电　捷克斯洛伐克社会主义共和国国民议会第四次会议最近通过了发展国民经济的第三个五年计划（1961—1965年）的法案。捷克斯洛伐克副总理兼国家计划委员会主席西穆?克就这个问题在议会作了报告。
    报告人说，第三个五年计划规定，国民收入增加42％以上。生产资料的生产在全部社会产品中所占的比例将从1960年的58.6％增加到1965年的60.7％。
    在今后五年中，仍将优先发展机器制造工业，特别是重型机器。机器的生产将增加76％以上。化学工业也将有重大的发展，五年中将进行一百三十项大型工程项目。
    西穆?克在谈到电力和燃料工业的任务时指出，主要注意力将放在开采俄斯特拉发—卡尔维那产煤区的焦煤。利用联合采煤机所生产的煤产量将增加一倍，约占那里全部产量的一半。
    第三个五年计划期间，为了改变农业生产的面貌，必须加速供应机器、矿物肥料和化学肥料，扩大土壤改良工作和采用新技术。必须不断降低农业生产费用。到1965年，农业生产费用要降低11％。在第三个五年计划期间，农业中的全部基本工作将要实现机械化。
    西穆?克在谈到基本建设时说，第三个五年计划期间的基本建设规模很大，投资将达到三千二百二十亿克朗，这比过去十年中的投资总额还要多。第三个五年计划还规定劳动生产率在工业中将提高43％，在建筑业中提高54％，在农业中至少提高53％。
    西穆?克说，预计在第三个五年计划期间不要很久就将使斯洛伐克同捷克两地区的经济水平趋于一致。他指出，斯洛伐克地区的工业总产值到1965年将增加84％。
