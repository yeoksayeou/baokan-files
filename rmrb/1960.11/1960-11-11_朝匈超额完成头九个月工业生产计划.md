Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 8th: The Central Statistical Bureau of the State Planning Commission of North Korea recently released a communique on the execution of the industrial production plan for the first nine months of this year. The communique pointed out that North Korea exceeded the total industrial output value plan by 3% in the first nine months of this year, and the total industrial output value increased by 13% compared with the same period last year.

The communique stated that the output of various important industrial products in the first nine months of this year, compared with the same period last year, increased as follows: electricity generation increased by 15%, coal 23%, pig iron and granulated iron 28%, steel 51%, metal cutting machine tools 4%, agricultural machinery and farm implements 216%, tractors two hundred and sixty-one times, trucks forty-six times, fertilizers 31%, cement 25%, textiles 33%, rayon 59%, artificial silk 19%, shoes 32%, aquatic products 40%, and vegetable oil 5%.

The communique said that in the first nine months of this year, the workers in the heavy industry sector not only overfulfilled the production plan, but also produced many new products for agricultural mechanization and to strengthen the technical equipment of various economic sectors. These include new agricultural machinery such as small tractors and grain harvesters, a 3,000-ton hydraulic press, a six-ton truck, a 5,000-kilowatt hydropower generator, a six-meter vertical lathe, and various new types of lathes.

During this period, workers in the light industry sector also expanded the variety and increased the output of textiles and daily necessities. In the first nine months of this year, more than 12.8 million meters of cloth and 140,000 pairs of shoes were produced more than planned. In addition, many new plastic daily necessities were produced.

The communique said that in response to the call of the Korean Workers' Party to "increase production with existing manpower and equipment," the workers of various factories and enterprises have mechanized many processes and adopted many advanced technologies, improving labor productivity and equipment utilization. For example, in the iron and steel industry, the average daily output per square meter of open hearth furnace bottom increased by 19% compared with the same period last year, and the steel rolled per hour by large rolling mills increased by 25% compared with the same period last year. For example, in the machinery industry, the cutting speed of metal cutting machine tools per minute increased by 3%, and in the building materials industry, the output of each cement kiln per hour increased by 9%.

The communique concluded by saying that the Chollima Workteam Movement, which has become a powerful driving force for the production and development of various sectors of the national economy, is being further rapidly expanded and developed. At present, more than 13,400 workteams and collectives, and more than 274,000 workers, technicians, and staff members have participated in this mass movement, and 852 workteams have won the glorious title of "Chollima Workteam."

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 10th: According to reports in the local press, Hungarian industrial departments have victoriously completed 104.2% of the production plan for the first three quarters of this year. The average daily industrial output during this period increased by 13.3% compared with the same period last year.

At present, the broad masses of workers in Hungary's industrial departments are striving to further improve labor productivity, reduce production costs, and practice strict economy, striving to achieve even better results in the fourth quarter.

The workers of the Borsodnádasd Steel Plate Rolling Mill have created a record of monthly production increases. As of October 15, they had overfulfilled the plan by 3,300 tons of semi-finished products, 2,900 tons of refined steel plates, and 42 tons of steel ingots. The seventy-two labor teams in the factory striving for the honorary title of "Socialist Labor Team" have decided to make November a "shock month," guaranteeing to save 860,000 forints (Hungarian currency) in November.

The Dimavag Machinery Factory completed its annual gift-giving task in the first three quarters. The workers have proposed to increase production by another 250,000 forints worth of products in the fourth quarter. Workers at the Pick Carriage and Machinery Factory in Győr exceeded the original plan to increase labor productivity by 3.2%.

The workers in the coal districts of Komárom County saved a total of 5,300 cubic meters of pit props in the first three quarters, which is enough to extract an additional 18,000 carriages of coal. Each coal district has organized pit prop protection teams to collect usable pit props and make full use of waste processing methods to save pit props. In the first three quarters, the Komló coal district reduced the production cost per ton of coal by nearly 80 forints due to technological innovation. They adopted a centralized mining method to increase labor productivity by one time more than the original plan, thereby increasing coal production by 70,000 tons. At the same time, the workers increased the utilization rate of loading and unloading machines. The amount of coal loaded and unloaded by machines in the third quarter was equivalent to the total mining volume in the first half of the year. The degree of mechanization in coal transportation also increased by 30% compared with last year.

Workers in the leather and textile industries have also achieved good results in increasing production and practicing economy. For example, the workers at the Pécs Leather Factory adopted an accelerated tanning method, reducing the tanning time for cowhide from 80 days to 20 days, and the tanning time for pigskin from two weeks to three hours. The economic value of this innovative suggestion is 3 million forints per year. At the same time, it will enable the factory to double its output next year without increasing investment.

The workers in the weaving and spinning workshops of the Hungarian Cotton Yarn Factory launched a "do not lose a single thread" movement from the beginning of the year. In addition to striving to improve their operating skills, the workers also carefully collected waste materials. In the first three quarters, the weaving workshop saved a total of 49 tons of cotton thread, and the spinning workshop saved a total of 26.9 tons of cotton, thus increasing the country's production of 200,000 meters of clothing fabric.

    朝匈超额完成头九个月工业生产计划
    新华社平壤8日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：朝鲜国家计划委员会中央统计局最近发表了关于今年头九个月工业生产计划执行情况的公报。公报指出，朝鲜今年头九个月超额3％完成了工业总产值计划，同去年同时期相比，工业总产值增长了13％。
    公报说，今年头九个月各种重要工业产品的产量，同去年同时期相比，增长的情况如下：发电量增长15％，煤炭23％，生铁和粒铁28％，钢材51％，金属切削机床4％，农业机械和农具类216％，拖拉机二百六十一倍，载重汽车四十六倍，化肥31％，水泥25％，纺织品33％，人造棉59％，人造丝19％，鞋类32％，水产品40％，植物油5％。
    公报说，今年头九个月，重工业部门的职工不仅超额完成了生产计划，而且为了农业机械化，为加强各经济部门的技术装备，生产了许多新的产品。其中包括小型拖拉机、麦类收割机等新的农业机械，三千吨的水压机，载重六吨的载重汽车，发电容量五千瓩的水力发电机，六米立式车床和各种新式车床等。
    在这一期间，轻工业部门的职工在纺织品和日用品的生产方面，也扩大了品种，提高了产量。在今年头九个月中，比原计划多生产了一千二百八十多万米布匹和十四万双鞋子，另外，还新生产了许多种塑料制的日用品。
    公报说，各工厂企业的职工为响应朝鲜劳动党提出的“以现有的人力和设备增加生产”的号召，把许多工序机械化了，并且采用许多先进技术，提高了劳动生产率和设备利用率。如在钢铁工业部门，平炉炉底平均每平方米的日产量比去年同时期增长了19％，大型轧钢机每小时轧制的钢材比去年同时期增长了25％。又如在机械工业部门，金属切削机床每分钟的切削速度提高了3％，在建筑材料工业部门，每座水泥烧成炉每小时的产量提高了9％。
    公报最后说，成为国民经济各部门生产发展的强大推动力的千里马作业班运动正在进一步地迅速扩大和发展。目前，已有一万三千四百多个作业班和集体、二十七万四千多名工人、技术人员和职员参加了这一群众性的运动，并已有八百五十二个作业班取得了“千里马作业班”的光荣称号。
    新华社布达佩斯10日电　据此间报刊报道，匈牙利工业部门已经胜利地完成今年头三个季度生产计划的104.2％。在这期间的工业平均日产量比去年同一时期提高了13.3％。
    目前，匈牙利工业部门的广大职工正在为进一步提高劳动生产率、降低生产成本和厉行节约而奋斗，力争在第四季度取得更优良的成绩。
    包尔绍德纳达日德钢板轧制厂的职工创造了月月增产的纪录，到10月15日为止，已超计划增产了三千三百吨半成品、二千九百吨的精致钢板和四十二吨的钢锭。全厂争取“社会主义劳动队”光荣称号的七十二个劳动队已决定把11月作为“突击月”，保证要在11月份节约八十六万福林（匈币名）。
    第马瓦格机器厂在头三个季度内就完成了全年的献礼任务。职工们已提出要在第四季度再增产价值二十五万福林的产品。吉厄尔市皮克车厢和机器厂职工超额完成原定的提高劳动生产率的献礼计划的3.2％。
    科马罗姆州各煤区工人在头三季度共节约了五千三百立方米的坑木，这足够用来额外开采一万八千车皮的煤。各煤区都组织了保护坑木小队，把能用的坑木都收集起来，并充分利用废料加工法来节约坑木。柯姆洛煤区在头三个季度中由于革新技术，使每吨煤的生产成本降低近八十福林。他们采用了集中开采法使劳动生产率比原订计划提高了一倍，从而增产了七万吨煤。与此同时，职工们提高了装卸机器的使用率。第三季度内用机器装卸煤的数量就相当于前半年内的总开采量。运输煤的机械化程度也比去年提高30％。
    皮革和纺织工业的职工在增产节约方面也取得了良好成绩。例如，佩奇皮革厂的职工采用了加速鞣革法，使牛皮的鞣革时间由过去的八十天降低到二十天，猪皮的鞣革时间由两个星期降低到三小时。这一革新建议的经济价值一年就达三百万福林。同时使这个工厂明年在不增加投资的情况下就可以把产量提高两倍。
    匈牙利棉纱厂的纺织车间和纺纱车间的职工从年初就掀起了“不损失一条线”的运动。职工们除努力提高自己的操作技术外并细心地收集废料。头三个季度纺织车间共节约了四十九吨棉线，纺纱车间共节约了二十六点九吨棉花，这样共为国家增产了二十万米的衣料。
