Xinhua News Agency, November 24th Dispatch from Elisabethville: The "UN Forces" in the Congo are intensifying their collusion with the traitorous Tshombe clique in Katanga province, in order to more viciously suppress the patriotic people in this province who resolutely oppose the "UN Forces'" invasion and Tshombe's treasonous activities.

Berendson, the UN representative in Elisabethville, the capital of Katanga province, and his deputy, Chevalier, held talks with Tshombe "in a relaxed atmosphere" yesterday. A joint communiqué issued afterward stated that they discussed various issues, including how to use the Katanga northern railway network and the UN's "pacification activities" in the "UN Forces" occupied areas.

Agence France-Presse reported that well-informed sources in Elisabethville commented on the talks, pointing out that "UN Forces" are actively participating in suppressing the Baluba people who are carrying out armed struggle in northern Katanga against the Tshombe clique and to defend the independence and unity of the Congo.

These talks were held immediately after US Ambassador to the Congo, Timberlake, visited Elisabethville for two days and held "very frank talks" with Tshombe. In a statement issued after his meeting with the US Ambassador, Tshombe said he felt "the greatest pleasure and satisfaction" at Timberlake's visit. According to the US Consul in Elisabethville, "The issue of relations between Katanga and the United States was discussed during the talks."

At the same time, the Tshombe clique's "propaganda department" announced that "UN Forces" and Tshombe's gendarmerie would form mixed patrols to deal with the patriotic people in the coal mining town of Luena, about one hundred and eighty-five miles from Elisabethville.

Reports say that the "UN Forces" in Luena have been reinforced and have taken measures to disarm the patriotic people.

It is reported that despite the joint suppression by the "UN Forces" and the traitorous clique, the people in northern Katanga province are still persisting in their struggle. Several groups of Baluba people have been found in Albertville, four hundred and thirty-five miles northwest of Elisabethville. The Baluba people have also set up roadblocks on the road near Gangoro.

    “联合国军”进一步露出打手本色
    加紧勾结冲伯集团镇压加丹加人民
    据新华社24日讯　伊利沙伯维尔消息：在刚果的“联合国军”正在加紧和加丹加省的卖国贼冲伯集团的勾结，以便更加凶恶地镇压这个省内坚决反对“联合国军”的入侵和冲伯的叛国活动的爱国人民。
    联合国驻加丹加省首府伊利沙伯维尔的代表贝伦德森和他的副手薛瓦利埃昨天同冲伯“在轻松的气氛中”举行了会谈。随后发表的一份联合公报说，他们讨论了包括如何使用加丹加北部的铁路网以及联合国在“联合国军”占领地带的“绥靖活动”在内的各项问题。
    法新社报道，伊利沙伯维尔消息灵通人士评论这次会谈时指出：“联合国军”正在积极参加镇压在加丹加北部进行武装斗争反对冲伯集团和保卫刚果的独立和统一的巴卢巴族人民。
    这次会谈是在美国驻刚果大使廷伯累克访问了伊利沙伯维尔两天并和冲伯举行了“十分坦率的会谈”后随即举行的。冲伯在和美国大使会谈后发表的声明中说：他对廷伯累克的访问感到“最大的高兴和满意”。据美国驻伊利沙伯维尔的领事说：“在会谈中谈到了加丹加和美国之间的关系问题”。
    同时，冲伯集团的“宣传部”宣布：“联合国军”和冲伯的宪兵部队将组成混合巡逻队，来对付离伊利沙伯维尔约一百八十五哩的煤矿城卢埃纳地区的爱国人民。
    有消息说：卢埃纳的“联合国军”已经得到增援，并且采取了解除爱国人民的武装的措施。
    据报道：尽管遭到“联合国军”和叛国集团的合力镇压，加丹加省北部的人民仍然坚持斗争。在伊利沙伯维尔西北四百三十五哩的阿尔伯特维尔已经发现了几批巴卢巴族人。巴卢巴人还在刚哥罗附近的公路上设置了路障。
