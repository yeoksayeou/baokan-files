    A Batch of New-Type University Students Graduate
    The cadre class of Power Economics major at Harbin Institute of Technology, composed of 35 leading cadres such as Party committee secretaries, bureau directors, section chiefs, and factory directors from various water conservancy and power industry systems, graduated in early November.
    These students, after three years of off-the-job study, have completed 21 courses, including high school and university cultural foundation courses, technical theory, and specialized technical (water, electricity, heat) and power economics courses, reaching the level of graduates from power economics specialized courses.
    Based on the characteristics of these students, the Party Committee of Harbin Institute of Technology has revised the teaching plan and syllabus several times and assigned experienced veteran teachers to lecture and tutor.
    Through systematic study, the students have been able to elevate the rich experience accumulated in their past practical work to a theoretical understanding; at the same time, they have gradually mastered the general knowledge of natural science and the basic laws of power production.

    Jinghe Commune Establishes "Love the Commune Activity Day" System
    While implementing the "Four Togethers" (eat, live, work, and study together) for cadres, the Jinghe Commune in Pingliang City, Gansu Province, has launched a "Love the Commune Activity Day" system among its members.
    The content of the activities includes: organizing members to discuss the Party's policies, summarize the work of the previous ten days, and decide on the production, living, financial, and labor management issues for the next ten days. After implementing this system, both cadres and members are very satisfied. They say that the "Love the Commune Activity Day" is a "Meeting of Minds" and a "Meeting for Handling Affairs," and they have summarized that the "Love the Commune Activity Day" has "Three Goods" and "Three Reassurances." The "Three Goods" are: good implementation of policies, good reliance on the masses to solve problems, and good combination of work and rest. The "Three Reassurances" are: reassurance in production (clear tasks, everyone is responsible), reassurance in life (members participate in managing the canteen, everyone is clear about the canteen's assets), and reassurance in work (the ten-day work is arranged in detail, the cadres' opinions are consistent, and there are fewer detours in the work).

    Strengthening Policy Education for Young People
    Recently, under the unified leadership of the Party, the Shanxi Xinding County Communist Youth League organizations have launched an educational campaign among League members and young people to "Study the Party's Policies Well, Publicize the Party's Policies Well, and Conscientiously Implement the Party's Policies." More than 47,000 young people throughout the county have received profound education, and 200 League members and young people who closely connect with the masses, conscientiously implement the Party's policies, and actively participate in labor have been commended by the County League Committee. In organizing young people to study policies, League organizations in various communes have used methods such as organizing policy report meetings, forums, and League classes to educate cadres above the level of League branch committee members and League members and young people. They explained various policies concerning rural people's communes in light of the actual situation. Through education, the political and ideological awareness and policy level of the vast number of young people have been further improved, which has powerfully promoted the rapid progress of the current autumn cultivation production and other work.

    Implementing the Class Line in Schools
    Hunan Agricultural College resolutely implements the class line in education work and takes many measures to accelerate the training of agricultural technical personnel for socialism from among the children of workers and peasants.
    After accepting a group of children of workers and peasants recommended by rural people's communes to study in 1958, the college compiled them into "Worker-Peasant Classes," organized teachers and students to specially compile a set of new teaching materials suitable for worker-peasant students to learn, and selected a group of experienced teachers to teach. The Party Committee Secretary also frequently went deep into the classrooms to check and supervise, so that teaching was continuously improved. At present, the students in the worker-peasant classes have excellent academic performance and have been rated as an "advanced collective" in learning throughout the college. This year, the proportion of students from worker-peasant backgrounds in the college has accounted for more than 65% of the total number of students.

    Earnestly Learn Production Techniques from Veteran Farmers
    Under the leadership of the Party branch, all cadres and young members of the Langying Production Team of the Qutan Commune in Ledu County, Qinghai Province, have launched a surge of enthusiasm for learning from veteran farmers, humbly learning agricultural production techniques, and have carried out comparisons for "Four More" (more running around, more asking, more watching, more doing), "One Careful" (careful learning), and "One Good" (respect the teachers well) activities. In order to make the teachers teach better and the students learn better, the Party branch often summarizes the teaching experiences among the masses and promotes them, which has powerfully promoted the current production.

    要闻快报
    一批新型大学生毕业
    由各地水利电力工业系统的党委书记、局长、处长、厂长等三十五名领导干部组成的哈尔滨工业大学动力经济专业干部班，已在十一月初毕业。
    这批学员经过三年来的离职学习，已学完了高中、大学文化基础课和技术理论，专业技术（水，电，热）及动力经济专业课等二十一门课程，达到动力经济专业专修科毕业生的水平。
    哈尔滨工业大学党委根据这批学员的特点，几次修改教学计划、教学大纲，配备了有丰富教学经验的老教师讲课和进行辅导。
    学员们经过系统学习，已经能够把过去实际工作中所积累的丰富经验，提高到理论上加以认识；同时也逐渐掌握了自然科学的一般知识和电力生产的基本规律。
    泾河公社建立　“爱社活动日”制度
    甘肃平凉市泾河公社在干部实行“四同”的同时，在社员中开展了“爱社活动日”制度。
    活动的内容有：组织社员讨论党的政策、总结前十天工作，并决定下十天的生产、生活、财务和劳动管理等问题。实行这一制度后，干部和社员都很满意。他们说“爱社活动日”是“明心会”、“通事会”，并总结出“爱社活动日”有“三好”、“三放心”。三好是：贯彻执行政策好，依靠群众解决问题好，劳逸结合好。“三放心”是：生产放心（任务明确，人人负责）、生活放心（社员参加管理食堂，食堂家底人人清楚）、工作放心（十日工作安排具体，干部意见一致，工作中少走弯路）。加强对青年的政策教育
    最近，山西忻定县团组织在党的统一领导下，在团员和青年中开展了一个“学习好党的政策、宣传好党的政策，认真执行党的政策”的教育活动。全县四万七千多青年普遍受到一次深刻教育，并且有二百名密切联系群众、认真执行党的政策、劳动积极的团员和青年，受到团县委的通报表扬。在组织青年学习政策中，各公社团组织都通过组织政策报告会、座谈会和上团课等方式，分别向团支部委员以上干部和团员、青年进行教育。他们结合实际情况，讲解了关于农村人民公社的各项政策。通过教育，广大青年的政治思想觉悟和政策水平有了进一步提高，有力地推动了当前秋耕生产和其他工作的迅速进展。
    学校中贯彻阶级路线
    湖南农学院坚决贯彻教育工作中的阶级路线，采取很多措施，加速培养工农子弟为社会主义的农业技术人材。
    这个学院在1958年接受了一批农村人民公社保送来学习的工农子弟后，就把他们编为“工农班”组织师生专门编写了一套适合工农学生学习的新教材，并挑选一批经验较丰富的教师任课。党委书记还经常深入课堂进行检查督促，使教学不断改进。目前工农班的学生学习成绩优异，已被评为全院的学习“先进集体”。今年，这个学院工农成分的学生，已占学生总数的65％以上。
    切实向老农学生产技术
    青海省乐都县瞿昙公社浪莹生产队的全体干部和青年社员在党支部的领导下，掀起了拜老农为师，虚心向老农学习农业生产技术的热潮，并开展了“四多”（多跑、多问、多看、多做）、“一细”（细心学）、“一好”（尊敬师傅好）的评比活动。为了使师傅教得更好，徒弟学得更好，党支部经常总结群众中的教学经验，予以推广，有力地推动了当前生产。
