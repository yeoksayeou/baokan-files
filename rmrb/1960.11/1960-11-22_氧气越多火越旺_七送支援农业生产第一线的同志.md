The More Oxygen, the Stronger the Fire

What effect will it have to implement the Party's policies among the masses? To put it simply: The enthusiasm of the masses is like fire, and the Party's policies are like oxygen. The more oxygen, the stronger the flame.

Fire cannot burn without oxygen; this is a natural law. The enthusiasm of the masses cannot be separated from the guidance of the Party's correct policies; this is a law of revolutionary struggle.

Whether or not work is done well is determined by people, by whether the enthusiasm of the masses has been brought into play. And whether the enthusiasm of the masses can be fully brought into play depends on whether the cadres earnestly implement the Party's policies. Chairman Mao said that policy is the life of the Party. No matter what we do, we must base ourselves on the Party's policies. To measure whether the work is good or not, we must see whether the Party's policies are implemented firmly and thoroughly. History has repeatedly proven this truth: As long as the Party's policies meet the masses, as long as they become the conscious action of the masses, it is like blowing oxygen on a flame. The revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses will immediately burn like a raging fire, with boundless power.

A news item in the People's Daily on November 15th stated that the cadres of Panjiazhuang People's Commune in Xingren County, Guizhou Province, resolutely implemented the Party's policies concerning the people's communes in every task. As a result, the enthusiasm of the commune members generally increased, and the entire commune presented a scene of prosperity in production, with everything getting better and better. This year, despite more than 100 days of drought, the total grain output basically reached last year's level. After retaining enough grain, seeds, and fodder, the entire commune overfulfilled the state's grain purchase target by 42%. Look, what tremendous power the Party's policies have exerted after being grasped by the masses!

The Party's policies are a unified embodiment of the various interests of the people (long-term interests and current interests, overall interests and partial interests, etc.). Therefore, correctly implementing the Party's policies can continuously adjust relations in all aspects, correctly handle various contradictions, and mobilize all positive factors to carry out the cause of socialist construction victoriously. All of the Party's policies proceed both from the long-term interests of the broad masses and from the existing awareness of the broad masses. Therefore, the broad masses need the Party's policies as a guide for action, just as flames need oxygen. However, to deliver oxygen to the work, to deliver it to the masses, the primary key is for the broad cadres to fully absorb oxygen and arm their minds with the Party's policies. We must remember what Chairman Mao taught us: "Being good at turning the Party's policies into the actions of the masses, being good at enabling every movement, every struggle of ours, not only to be understood by the leading cadres, but also to be understood and grasped by the broad masses, this is a Marxist-Leninist art of leadership. Whether our work makes mistakes or not, the boundary lies here." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, page 1318)

    氧气越多火越旺
    ——七送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    把党的政策贯彻到群众中去，会产生什么样的作用？打个比方：群众的积极性好比是火，党的政策好比是氧气，氧气越多，火焰越旺。
    火的燃烧离不开氧气，这是一条自然规律；群众的积极性离不开党的正确的政策作指导，这是一条革命斗争的规律。
    工作做得好不好，决定的因素在于人，在于群众的积极性是不是发挥出来了；而群众的积极性能不能充分地发挥出来，关键问题又在于干部是不是认真贯彻执行了党的政策。毛主席说，政策是党的生命。无论办什么事情，做什么工作，都必须以党的政策为依据，衡量工作的好与不好，就要看党的政策贯彻得是不是坚决、是不是彻底。历史反复地证明了这条真理：党的政策只要一和群众见面，只要一变为群众自觉的行动，就如同氧气吹在火焰上，广大群众的革命积极性和创造性立刻就像烈火一样熊熊地燃烧起来，威力无穷。
    11月15日人民日报上有一条消息：贵州省兴仁县潘家庄人民公社的干部在每一项工作中都坚决贯彻党的有关人民公社的政策，结果社员的生产积极性普遍高涨，全社的生产呈现一片兴旺景象，样样工作越办越好。今年在一百多天干旱的情况下，粮食总产量基本上达到去年的水平，全社在留足口粮、种籽、饲料以后，超额42％完成了国家征购粮食的任务。看：党的政策被群众掌握了以后，发挥出了多么巨大的威力！
    党的政策，是集中体现人民群众的各方面利益（长远的利益和目前的利益、整体的利益和局部的利益，等等）的统一体。因此，正确地执行了党的政策，就能不断地调整各方面的关系，正确地处理各种矛盾，把一切积极因素都调动起来，胜利地进行社会主义建设事业。党的所有政策，都是既从广大群众的长远利益出发，又从广大群众的现有觉悟出发，所以广大群众就像火焰需要氧气一样，需要党的政策作为行动的指针。然而，要把氧气输送到工作中去，输送到群众中去，首要的关键在于广大的干部充分地吸收氧气，用党的政策武装自己的思想。我们一定要记住毛主席教导我们的话：“善于把党的政策变为群众的行动，善于使我们的每一个运动，每一个斗争，不但领导干部懂得，而且广大的群众都能懂得，都能掌握，这是一项马克思列宁主义的领导艺术。我们的工作犯不犯错误，其界限也在这里。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第一三一八页）
