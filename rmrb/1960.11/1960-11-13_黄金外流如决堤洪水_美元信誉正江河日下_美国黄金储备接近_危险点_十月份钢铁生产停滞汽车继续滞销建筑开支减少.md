Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 12th: U.S. gold reserves continue to decline rapidly.

According to the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's announcement on the 10th, as of November 9th, gold reserves have fallen to $18,116 million. This figure is only $116 million away from the $18 billion level, which is considered the "danger point" of U.S. gold reserves.

The recent loss of U.S. gold reserves has been like a burst dam. Following a record loss of $176 million in gold on November 3rd, another $39 million was lost on the 4th. From June 30th to November 9th this year, U.S. gold reserves have decreased by $1,206 million.

An investigation published in today's U.S. "Business Week" admits that the "foreign giants" holding U.S. short-term debt have a "tendency to unload." In other words, to transfer their dollar funds out of the United States.

An article published in the British "Times" on the 10th told the United States bluntly that the devaluation of the dollar against gold "will sooner or later prove inevitable." The newspaper emphasized that "the outflow of American gold makes many parties hold this view even more." The newspaper ridiculed the U.S. official attempt to attribute the recent gold rush in the capitalist world to "speculation," writing: "How can speculators benefit from buying gold at $37 and $38 an ounce without the prospect of raising the official price above $35?" The newspaper also sarcastically said, "The actions of the U.S. authorities have not been very effective in dispelling this view (referring to publicly announcing devaluation)." It went on to point out that there were reports that the United States asked the central banks of Western countries not to convert their dollar reserves into gold, especially not to allow dollars in private hands to be exchanged for gold, and that the United States had not made any arrangements to sell more gold to the market during the recent gold rush. The newspaper said, "Everyone, even the U.S. Treasury, knows very well that the dollar in 1960 is not the dollar in 1934, just as the pound in 1960 is not the pre-war pound." The current U.S. maintaining the price of gold at $35 an ounce "is only maintaining a nominal rather than an actual parity." The newspaper demanded that the dollar price of gold "be increased accordingly in proportion to the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar."

This newspaper reports: In October, the situation of the three pillars of the U.S. economy—steel, automobiles, and construction—remained bleak.

According to the "Wall Street Journal," U.S. steel production in October was 6.85 million tons, only slightly higher than in August. And "under normal circumstances, October should increase much more than August." The stagnation of steel production, according to the U.S. "Newsweek," has "worried Washington and Pittsburgh."

In October, U.S. automobile sales continued to lag, and inventories continued to increase. The "Wall Street Journal" wrote: "On October 20, automobile inventories were 895,000 vehicles, the highest record for this season of the year. It is expected that production in November will not exceed October (617,816 vehicles were produced in October) and may be lower than 600,000 vehicles."

According to a survey by the Census Bureau, U.S. construction spending in October was at an annual rate of $55 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% from September.

### 黄金外流如决堤洪水　美元信誉正江河日下  美国黄金储备接近“危险点”  十月份钢铁生产停滞汽车继续滞销建筑开支减少

    黄金外流如决堤洪水　美元信誉正江河日下
    美国黄金储备接近“危险点”
    十月份钢铁生产停滞汽车继续滞销建筑开支减少
    据新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国黄金储备继续迅速下降。
    据美国联邦储备委员会10日宣布，截至本月9日为止，黄金储备已下降到一百八十一亿一千六百万美元。这个数字距离被认为是美国黄金储备的“危险点”的一百八十亿水平只差一亿一千六百万美元了。
    最近美国黄金储备流失情况有如决堤洪水。继本月3日一天中创纪录地流失了一亿七千六百万美元黄金之后，4日这一天又失去了三千九百万美元黄金。从今年6月30日到本月9日为止，美国的黄金储备减少了十二亿零六百万美元。
    今天出版的美国“商业周刊”所发表的一篇调查承认，持有美国短期债务的“外国巨头们”有一种“想要脱手的倾向”。换句话说，把他们在美国的美元资金转移。
    英国“泰晤士报”10日发表的一篇文章直截了当地告诉美国，美元对黄金比价的贬值的道路“迟早会证明是不可避免的”。报纸强调说，“美国黄金的外流更加使许多方面人士持这种看法”。报纸嘲笑美国官方企图把最近资本主义世界抢购黄金风潮归之于“投机”的说法，报纸写道：“假如没有把官价提高到三十五美元以上的前景，投机商以每盎斯三十七美元和三十八美元的价格购买黄金怎样能得到好处？”报纸还挖苦说，“美国当局的行动在打消这种看法（指公开宣布贬值）上并不是十分有效的”。它接着指出，有消息说，美国要求西方各国的中央银行不要把自己的美元储存兑成黄金，尤其是不要让私人手中的美元换成黄金，在最近发生抢购黄金时美国也没有作出任何安排来向市场抛售更多的黄金。报纸说，“每一个人，那怕就是美国财政部都十分了解，1960年的美元并不是1934年的美元，这正如1960年的英镑不是战前的英镑一样。”美国目前保持每盎斯黄金三十五美元的价格“不过是保持一种名义上而不是实际上的平价”。报纸要求黄金的美元价格“按照美元购买力下降的比例相应提高”。
    本报讯　在10月份，美国经济的三大支柱——钢铁、汽车、建筑，情况仍然不妙。
    据“华尔街日报”报道，10月份，美国的钢产量为六百八十五万吨，比8月份只稍为增加。而“在通常情况下，10月份要比8月份增加很多。”钢铁生产的停滞不前，据美国“新闻周刊”说，已“使华盛顿和匹兹堡感到担忧”。
    在10月份，美国汽车继续滞销，库存量不断增加。“华尔街日报”写道：“在10月20日汽车存货为八十九万五千辆，这是每年这个季节存货的最高纪录。预料11月份生产不会超过10月份（10月份生产汽车六十一万七千八百一十六辆），而且可能低于六十万辆。”
    根据国情普查局的调查，10月份美国各项建筑的开支为年率五百五十亿美元，比9月份下降约1％。
