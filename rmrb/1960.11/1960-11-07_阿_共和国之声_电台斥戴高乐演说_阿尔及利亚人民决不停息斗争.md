Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 5th: The "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio station broadcast on the evening of November 5th that the Algerian revolution would never stop, and the struggle would never cease until Algeria achieved independence.

The radio station said that regardless of France's wishes, the Algerian people would achieve independence through struggle.

The radio broadcast was in response to De Gaulle's radio address on the 4th. In his speech, De Gaulle insisted on a colonialist policy towards Algeria and continued to peddle the so-called "self-determination" plan, which aimed to get the Algerian National Liberation Army to lay down its arms.

The radio station said that French politicians who dreamed of achieving a ceasefire in Algeria before recognizing our freedom and independence should understand that "this is impossible."

The radio station then said that although France's conspiracy to stop the Algerian revolution had failed, De Gaulle was still playing with words. He should understand that the Algerian revolution is determined to realize Algeria's freedom and independence, restore the sovereignty of the Algerian people, and never give up a single iota of this sovereignty.

The radio station also said that Algeria's international status has been enhanced, and it has unlimited potential for struggle. How could De Gaulle and other French politicians imagine that the great Algerian revolution would listen to the false promises and dazzling deceptive plans and proposals made from time to time by French imperialist politicians and stop fighting?

The radio station concluded by saying that neither De Gaulle nor anyone else could deceive the Algerian people with sweet words and false plans about independence and freedom, because any plan that does not allow the Algerian people to obtain dignity and sovereignty will be rejected and will only be a futile attempt.

    阿“共和国之声”电台斥戴高乐演说
    阿尔及利亚人民决不停息斗争
    新华社开罗5日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台5日晚广播说，在阿尔及利亚没有获得独立以前，阿尔及利亚革命决不会停止，斗争也决不会停息。
    电台说，不论法国的意愿如何，阿尔及利亚人民将通过斗争来取得独立。
    电台是针对戴高乐4日的广播演说发表的。戴高乐在演说中坚持对阿尔及利亚的殖民主义政策，继续兜售目的在于使阿尔及利亚民族解放军放下武器的所谓“自决”计划。
    电台说，梦想在承认我们的自由和独立之前在阿尔及利亚实现停火的法国政客们应当懂得，“这是办不到的事”。
    电台接着说，尽管法国企图制止阿尔及利亚革命的阴谋已经失败，但是戴高乐还在玩弄口舌。他应当懂得，阿尔及利亚革命决意要实现阿尔及利亚的自由和独立，恢复阿尔及利亚人民的主权，并且决不放弃这种主权的一丝一毫。
    电台又说，阿尔及利亚的国际地位提高了，它有无限的斗争潜力，戴高乐和其它的法国政客们怎么可能设想伟大的阿尔及利亚革命会听从法帝国主义政客们不时作出的虚假诺言以及令人眼花缭乱的骗人计划和建议而停止斗争呢？
    电台最后说，不论是戴高乐或者其它任何人都不能用关于独立和自由的甜言蜜语和假计划来欺骗阿尔及利亚人民，因为不让阿尔及利亚人民获得尊严和主权的任何计划都将遭到拒绝，而只是徒劳无益的企图罢了。
