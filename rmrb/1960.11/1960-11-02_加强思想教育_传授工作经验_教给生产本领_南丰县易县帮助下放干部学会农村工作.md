    Strengthening Ideological Education, Imparting Work Experience, Teaching Production Skills
    Nanfeng County and Yi County Help Downward-Bound Cadres Learn Rural Work

    (Our Dispatch) Jiangxi's Nanfeng County's Party committees at all levels have strengthened political and ideological education for downward-bound cadres, providing them with sincere care and enthusiastic assistance in all aspects, enabling them to further play their role in grassroots positions.

    After the Party put forward the call to vigorously develop agriculture and grain production, more than 220 cadres (including 153 Party members and 42 League members) in Nanfeng County voluntarily requested to be sent to the countryside. With the care and help of Party committees at all levels, all the downward-bound cadres have fully exerted their strength at the grassroots level in the past two months and achieved outstanding results. Recently, after evaluation by the masses throughout the county, 200 comrades, accounting for 93.6% of all downward-bound cadres, were rated as model cadres.

    Nanfeng County's Party committees at all levels first care for downward-bound cadres ideologically, strengthening regular political and ideological education. On the one hand, Party committees at all levels insisted on arranging two hours of study time for downward-bound cadres every day, organizing everyone to earnestly study the Party's instructions on vigorously developing agriculture and grain production and other relevant documents, enhancing their understanding of the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation, and inspiring their enthusiasm for work and labor. On the other hand, Party committees at all levels adopted a combination of general education and individual assistance to meticulously help downward-bound cadres solve difficult problems and encourage them to overcome difficulties. Zou Pusun, a cadre from the County Grain Bureau, was sent to Dayuan Brigade of Gucheng Commune as the team leader. At first, he was very enthusiastic, but later he encountered some difficulties and became a little discouraged. After the commune Party committee learned about this, it immediately educated and encouraged him, and helped him overcome difficulties in work and labor. Recently, Zou Pusun was rated as a "five-good" cadre who is "good in work, good in labor, good in study, good in unity, and good in contact with the masses." In order to better assist downward-bound cadres, the County Party Committee convened a county-wide conference of downward-bound cadres in late September, leading everyone to comprehensively summarize the achievements made in the previous period and commend a group of models. Through this conference, the idea of taking rural work as an honor was further established among the downward-bound cadres, and a competition to learn from models and catch up with advanced elements was immediately launched after the meeting. Driven by the competition, many downward-bound cadres brought their families back to the countryside, determined to settle down in the countryside and build it for a long time.

    Nanfeng County's Party committees at all levels also tried every means to help downward-bound cadres quickly become familiar with the countryside and learn rural work. This measure enabled many downward-bound cadres who had rarely been to the countryside in the past to quickly learn rural work. Xiong Zhengguo, a cadre from the County Grain Bureau, was not familiar with rural work in the past. After being sent to Qiacun Team of Qiacun Brigade of Qiacun Commune as the team leader, he was not very good at arranging work and production. Xie Haisheng, the secretary of the brigade Party branch, personally came to help Xiong Zhengguo and taught him the working method of "visiting in the morning, working during the day, and holding meetings in the evening." After that, Xiong Zhengguo's work became organized and orderly. As the work got better and better, Xiong Zhengguo's confidence became stronger and his enthusiasm became greater. Now he has become an excellent production team leader. In addition, Party committees at all levels also tried their best to absorb downward-bound cadres to participate in meetings to study production and arrange work, so that they could become familiar with rural work from them; at the same time, they paid attention to absorbing the opinions of downward-bound cadres on work, and guided them on how to do rural work well. In this way, the downward-bound cadres were effectively helped and encouraged.

    Nanfeng County's Party committees at all levels also showed great concern for the various difficulties faced by downward-bound cadres in labor and production. At the beginning, the cadres did not have tools when they went to the fields, so Party organizations at all levels promptly helped them equip themselves with tools; after the cadres worked in the fields for a few days, they felt sore and painful in their backs, so Party organizations at all levels immediately educated them to pay attention to proper rest, and encouraged them to overcome difficulties and persevere. In labor, Party organizations at all levels educated cadres to humbly learn production techniques and experience from the masses, and at the same time mobilized commune members to help cadres learn production techniques, and organized experienced farmers to take apprentices, leading cadres to the fields, teaching and learning at the same time, and helping downward-bound cadres quickly learn production.

    Another important aspect of Nanfeng County's Party committees' concern for downward-bound cadres is to care for their lives meticulously. Party committees at all levels arranged food, lodging and rest time for downward-bound cadres in the same way as they cared for commune members. Responsible cadres of Party organizations at all levels often visited downward-bound cadres to help solve difficulties in their lives; the Party committees also gave appropriate care to the family members of downward-bound cadres who stayed in cities and organs.

    (Our Dispatch) The Yi County Xianyugong Commune Party Committee in Hebei Province, focusing on grasping the current production, starting from specific problems, and taking measures to strengthen the leadership of downward-bound cadres, enabled the downward-bound cadres to become familiar with the work in a short period of time, improved their leadership level, and effectively promoted the current production.

    In mid-September, fifty-nine cadres from the province, city, county, and commune were sent down to thirteen production teams in Xianyugong Commune. These cadres had high enthusiasm for work and great ambitions to change the face of backward areas. However, due to their different work areas and work nature in the past, they encountered some difficulties when they first went to the production team. For example, young cadres sent down from the province and city generally lacked experience in leading agricultural production and had relatively few work methods; some old cadres were also somewhat unfamiliar with the rural situation and work due to their long separation from the grassroots. After analyzing the above situation, the commune Party committee believed that improving the leadership level of these cadres to meet the needs of the new situation was an important issue at present. Therefore, the commune Party committee assigned a secretary to be responsible for strengthening the leadership of downward-bound cadres in all aspects.

    The commune Party committee first led and organized the downward-bound cadres to study and master the policies to improve their policy level. The commune Party committee promptly explained to the downward-bound cadres the instructions from the higher levels and the problems existing in the countryside, and stipulated a system of four hours of study per week, so that the downward-bound cadres could consciously pay attention to policy issues and strictly follow the policies.

    Another measure taken by the commune Party committee to strengthen the leadership of downward-bound cadres was to seize the key to the current work, and the secretary took the lead in making a model and then spreading the experience. In the work of the three autumns, the commune Party committee found that some downward-bound cadres did not know how to measure production, so the commune Party committee organized them to further study the distribution policy, and the first secretary of the Party committee, Wang Guocai, conducted a pilot project in Xianyugong Production Team, summed up the experience of measuring actual output, and held a meeting of downward-bound cadres to promote it.

    In addition, the commune Party committee also adopted the method of having the Party committee secretary and members be responsible for helping downward-bound cadres in the work area according to the division of labor. By going deep into the key points, the downward-bound cadres could work with clear ideas and be confident, and always seize and solve the key problems of the production team. Wang Youtian, the Party committee member in charge of the Bao Yaocun area, found that the labor force was not fully mobilized in the autumn harvest work in the Beicheng Team, and promptly pointed out that solving this problem was the key. The downward-bound cadres and the cadres of the production team carried out publicity and education among the masses, and conducted a household survey and registration of the labor force, mobilized everyone to formulate work plans, and increased the number of people attending work in the team, so that harvesting, plowing and wheat planting were all arranged, and it was possible to harvest one piece and plant one piece, making it an advanced team in the three autumn tasks.

    The commune Party committee also paid special attention to strengthening the leadership of the downward-bound cadres in their studies, so that they could learn from the local cadres and from the old farmers. This not only effectively improved the leadership ability of the downward-bound cadres, but also further enhanced the work enthusiasm of the local grassroots cadres. A good atmosphere of unity, mutual assistance, mutual teaching and mutual learning emerged in the work. In order to take the best from each other and improve together, the commune Party committee also paid attention to the work of summarizing and promoting experience in a timely manner. Now the "collective research, division of labor, cooperation on major issues, and separate handling of minor issues" working method has been widely promoted in the production teams with downward-bound cadres, so that the role of collective leadership has been fully utilized and the initiative of the cadres has been inspired, and the local grassroots cadres have also gained strong assistants.

    Recently, in order to further improve the leadership level of the downward-bound cadres, the commune Party committee stipulated some methods so that these cadres could participate in meetings in a timely manner, so as to understand the leadership's intentions in a timely manner and clarify the direction of work. At the same time, in order to earnestly implement the "four togethers" and "five goods," it was also stipulated that an evaluation would be conducted once a month, red flags would be inserted, and pacesetters would be set up to promote the development of the study, catch-up, and surpass campaign.

    加强思想教育　传授工作经验　教给生产本领
    南丰县易县帮助下放干部学会农村工作
    本报讯　江西南丰县各级党委加强对下放干部的政治思想教育，从各方面给予亲切关怀和热情帮助，使他们在基层岗位上进一步发挥了作用。
    党提出大办农业大办粮食的号召后，南丰县有二百二十多名干部（其中有一百五十三名党员，四十二名团员）自动要求下放到了农村。在各级党委的关怀和帮助下，两个多月来，全体下放干部在基层充分发挥自己的力量，取得了十分出色的成绩。最近，经过全县群众的评比，有二百名、即占全体下放干部93.6％的同志，被评为模范干部。
    南丰县各级党委首先从思想方面关怀下放干部，加强经常性的政治思想教育。一方面，各级党委坚持为下放干部安排每天有两小时的学习时间，组织大家认真学习党的大办农业大办粮食的指示和其他有关文件，提高他们对于以农业为基础的方针的认识，鼓舞他们的工作和劳动热情。另一方面，各级党委采取普遍教育与个别帮助相结合的办法，细致地帮助下放干部解决疑难问题，鼓励他们克服困难。县粮食局干部邹普孙下放到古城公社大源大队当队长，开始他劲头挺大，后来遇到了一些困难，便有些泄劲。公社党委知道后，立即对他进行了教育和鼓励，并帮助他克服了工作和劳动中的困难。最近，邹普孙被评为“工作好、劳动好、学习好、团结好、联系群众好”的“五好”干部。为了更好地帮助下放干部，县委在9月下旬召开了全县下放干部大会，领导大家全面总结了前一时期取得的成绩，表扬了一批模范。通过这次会议，在下放干部中进一步树立了以农村工作为荣的思想，会后立即就掀起了学模范、赶先进的竞赛。在竞赛的推动下，许多下放干部纷纷把自己的家属接回农村，决心在农村安家立业，长期建设农村。
    南丰县各级党委还千方百计帮助下放干部迅速熟悉农村，学会农村工作。这一措施使许多过去很少下过农村的下放干部迅速学会了农村工作。县粮食局干部熊正国过去对农村工作不熟悉，下放到恰村公社恰村大队恰村小队当队长后，不大会安排工作和生产，大队党支部书记谢海生就亲自来帮助熊正国，教他学会了“早晨转、白天干、晚上会”的工作方法。这以后，熊正国的工作就有条有理了。随着工作越做越好，熊正国的信心更足了，干劲更大了。现在他已成为一名出色的生产小队长。此外，各级党委还尽可能吸收下放干部参加研究生产、布置工作的会议，让他们从中熟悉农村工作；同时，注意吸取下放干部对工作的意见，并从中诱导他们学会怎样做好农村工作。这样，就有力地帮助和鼓舞了下放干部。
    南丰县各级党委还非常关心下放干部在劳动生产中的各种困难。开始，干部下田没有工具，各级党组织便及时帮助他们配置了工具；干部下田劳动几天后，感到腰酸背痛，各级党组织立即教育他们注意适当休息，并鼓励他们克服困难，坚持下去。在劳动中，各级党组织教育干部虚心向群众学习生产技术和经验，同时发动社员帮助干部学习生产技术，并组织老农带徒弟，带领干部下田，边教边学，帮助下放干部迅速学会生产。
    南丰县各级党委关心下放干部的另一个重要方面，是无微不至地关怀他们的生活。各级党委像关心社员一样，为下放干部妥善安排了吃、住和休息时间。各级党组织的负责干部经常访问下放干部，帮助解决生活中的困难；对下放干部留在城市、机关的家属，党委也给予了适当的照顾。
    本报讯　河北省易县贤寓公社党委以抓好当前生产为中心，从具体问题入手，采取措施加强对下放干部的领导，使下放干部在短时间内熟悉了工作，提高了领导水平，并有效地促进了当前生产。
    9月中旬，有省、市、县、社五十九名干部分别下放到贤寓公社十三个生产队。这些干部工作热情高，有改变落后地区面貌的雄心大志。但是，由于他们过去的工作地区、工作性质不同，刚下到生产队的时候，遇到一些困难。例如，省、市下放的青年干部，一般都缺乏领导农业生产的经验，工作办法比较少；一些老干部也由于脱离基层时间较长，对农村的情况和工作也有些生疏。公社党委分析了上述情况以后，认为提高这些干部的领导水平，使其适应新形势的需要，是当前一个重要问题。于是公社党委确定一名书记负责，从各方面加强对下放干部的领导。
    公社党委首先领导和组织下放干部学习和掌握政策，来提高下放干部的政策水平。公社党委把上级的指示和当前农村里存在的问题，及时地向下放干部交代清楚，并且规定每周学习四小时的制度，使下放干部能够自觉地注意政策问题，并严格地按照政策办事。
    公社党委加强对下放干部领导的另一项措施是：抓住当前工作中的关键，书记动手做出样板，再传播经验。在三秋工作中，公社党委发现部分下放干部不知如何测产，公社党委就一面组织他们进一步学习分配政策，一面由党委第一书记王国才在贤寓生产队试点，总结了测实产量的经验，召开下放干部会议进行推广。
    另外，公社党委还采取了由党委书记和委员，按分工包干的工作片负责帮助下放干部。通过深入重点，使下放干部工作起来思想明确，心中有底，时刻抓住和解决生产队的关键问题。负责包姚村片的党委委员王友田，发现北城队在三秋工作中劳力发动的不充分，就及时指出以解决这个问题为重点。下放干部和生产队的干部一起，向群众开展宣传教育，并且逐户进行了劳力普查登记，发动人人制订出工作计划，全队出勤人数增加，使收秋、耕地和种麦等都有了安排，作到了收一块种一块，成为三秋工作中的上游队。
    公社党委还特别注意加强对下放干部学习的领导，使他们向本地干部学习，向老农学习。不仅有效地提高了下放干部的领导能力，也进一步发挥了当地基层干部的工作积极性，在工作中出现了一个团结互助、互教互学的良好风气。为了作到取长补短共同提高，公社党委还注意了及时总结和推广经验的工作。现在这个公社在有下放干部的生产队，已普遍推行了“集体研究，分工负责，大事合作，小事分头办”的工作方法，从而充分发挥了集体领导的作用，启发了干部的工作主动性，当地基层干部也增加了有力助手。
    最近，公社党委为了进一步提高下放干部的领导水平，规定了一些办法，使这些干部能够及时参加会议，作到及时了解领导意图，明确工作方向。同时，为了认真执行“四同”、“五好”，还规定每月进行一次评比，插红旗、树标兵，以促进学、赶、超竞赛运动的开展。（附图片）
