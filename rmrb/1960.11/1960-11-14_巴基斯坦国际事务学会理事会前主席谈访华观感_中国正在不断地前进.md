Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 12th - Professor Halim, former chairman of the Council of the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs, praised China's tremendous achievements in various fields of construction over the past eleven years at a gathering here on the 11th, and advocated the establishment of a Chinese language and literature department in a Pakistani university to pave the way for promoting cultural exchanges between China and Pakistan.

Professor Halim returned to Karachi not long ago after visiting China.

He said last night at a report on Chinese education issues to the Council of the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs in Karachi, "The impression I gained from my visits throughout China is that this country is constantly moving forward along the path of progress. Towns are being modernized. New buildings are emerging. Industry is growing rapidly, and even in the countryside, factories are being established. Steps are being taken in every possible way to develop agriculture. Afforestation work is being carried out on a large scale."

Professor Halim described in detail the development of education in China over the past eleven years in his report. He said, "There is no doubt that China has made great progress in education since 1949 and is still continuing to advance." He cited specific figures to illustrate the great achievements of Chinese school education and mass education.

Halim said that China and Pakistan are close neighbors, and there was considerable cultural exchange between the two countries in ancient times. He said that when he visited China this time, the Chinese educators he met all expressed their hope to strengthen cultural ties between the two countries. He said, "I think that a Chinese language and literature department should be established in a Pakistani university as a starting point in this regard to pave the way for future improvement of cultural exchanges."

Halim also said in his report, "There is religious freedom in China. Everyone has the freedom to believe or not to believe in religion."

Professor Halim's report aroused great interest among the audience. After the report, Professor Halim answered many questions from the audience about the new China.

    巴基斯坦国际事务学会理事会前主席谈访华观感
    中国正在不断地前进
    新华社卡拉奇12日电　巴基斯坦国际事务学会理事会前主席哈利姆教授11日在这里的一次集会上，赞扬中国十一年来各方面建设的巨大成就，并主张在巴基斯坦的一所大学中建立中国语言文学系，以便为促进中国和巴基斯坦的文化交流铺平道路。
    哈利姆教授是在访问中国后不久以前回到卡拉奇的。
    他昨晚在卡拉奇巴基斯坦国际事务学会理事会就中国教育问题作报告时说，“在中国各地的访问中，我所获得的印象是，这个国家正在不断地沿着进步的道路前进。市镇在现代化。新的建筑物在出现。工业在迅速成长，即使是在乡村里，工厂也在建立起来。正在以一切可能的办法采取步骤来发展农业。造林工作正在大规模地进行。”
    哈利姆教授在他的报告中详细地叙述了过去十一年中中国教育的发展。他说，“毫无疑问，自从1949年以来中国已在教育方面取得了巨大的进展，并且仍然在继续前进。”他列举了具体数字说明中国学校教育和群众教育的伟大成就。
    哈利姆说，中国和巴基斯坦是近邻，在古时，两国之间有相当多的文化交流。他说，当他这次在中国访问时，他所会见的中国教育工作者都表示希望加强两国之间的文化联系。他说，“我认为，应该在巴基斯坦的一所大学中建立中国语言文学系作为这方面的一个开端，以便为将来改善文化交流铺平道路。”
    哈利姆在报告中还说，“在中国是有宗教自由的。每一个人都有信教或不信教的自由。”
    哈利姆教授的报告在听众中间引起了巨大的兴趣。在报告结束后，哈利姆教授回答了听众提出的有关新中国的很多问题。
