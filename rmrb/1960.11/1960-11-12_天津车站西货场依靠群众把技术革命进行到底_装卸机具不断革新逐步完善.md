People's Daily report:

    Tianjin Railway Station's West Freight Yard's workers have promoted the spirit of continuous revolution, improving many innovative tools from imperfect to perfect, and combining single tools into sets, giving full play to the effectiveness of loading and unloading machinery. Now, with a 20% increase in the annual volume of goods dispatched, timely loading and unloading has been achieved, with no railcars being held up. The average dwell time for railcars at the yard in October was 4.85 hours, a 39% reduction compared to January. Due to increased labor productivity, 180 loading and unloading workers have been saved, accounting for 45% of the total number of loading and unloading workers, realizing the requirement of "increased production with fewer people."
    The technical revolution at the West Freight Yard began in December of last year. Within a few days, a large number of loading and unloading machines were manufactured. However, after some new machines were put into production, although the efficiency of individual operations was greatly improved, the overall loading and unloading efficiency decreased, and the dwell time of vehicles at the yard did not shorten. The freight yard's Party branch seriously checked the work of the previous stage and analyzed the reasons for the decline in the utilization rate of machinery: (1) From the perspective of the machines themselves, the main problems were that the performance was not perfect enough and the mobility was inconvenient, especially the failure to form complete sets in a timely manner according to needs; (2) In terms of improving the technical level of workers, attention was not paid to guiding them towards self-use, self-repair, and self-management, and only satisfying that workers could use them; (3) Some of the original management systems could not adapt to the needs after mechanization. Therefore, it was decided to consolidate and expand the achievements of the technical revolution in the following aspects:
    First, all kinds of conservative ideas were criticized to pave the way for the use and promotion of new machines. In the initial stage of putting new machines into production, the efficiency of individual operations increased, and some cadres developed a complacent and relaxed attitude, believing that "the technical revolution is almost over, there is nothing more to do." After using the new machines for a period of time, some cadres had doubts and wavering emotions, and even when the loading and unloading tasks were heavy, they did not use new machines, but still took the approach of increasing manpower. In order to solve these ideological problems, the freight yard's Party branch organized employees to conduct special discussions, criticized conservative ideas, and carried out positive education by seizing typical cases. For example, in the past, coal unloading electric shovels were not easy to use, and the masses were not mobilized well. A few cadres decided to change them to single-person electric shovels, which were almost all idle because they were not practical. Later, they were improved based on the opinions of the masses and quickly promoted. The freight yard's Party branch promptly educated the cadres to learn from this lesson. At the same time, through technical performance competitions, the experience of loading and unloading teams 2 and 4 in adhering to the use of machinery and improving machinery was summarized and promoted.
    Second, the direction was clarified, overall planning was carried out, types were selected and finalized, and sets were formed. They adopted the method of "three combinations" of leading cadres, workers, and technicians to classify and rank the existing innovative machines and select and finalize the types. Then, the masses were mobilized to improve a batch in a planned way, promote a batch, and consolidate and improve a batch. In the past six months, a total of 284 innovative machines have been repaired and improved. With the cooperation of the municipal transportation department, 1,300 meters of high roadbed and smooth station platforms, three underground conveyor belts, and five elevated hoppers have been built, so that the loading and unloading machines for bulk cargo have basically been matched into sets. The improved new machines are easy for workers to use and have good results. For example, the coal unloading electric shovel is installed with ball bearings and large rubber wheels, which is convenient to move. In the past, workers were unwilling to use it, but now they are rushing to use it. In particular, after connecting the high roadbed, electric shovel, underground conveyor belt, and elevated hopper to form a mechanical linkage operation line, continuous operation from unloading trains to loading trucks is achieved, which not only increased the cargo capacity of the coal and sand lines by four times and increased the efficiency of unloading trains by 20%, but also shortened the time for loading trucks by about 20%.
    Third, the technical level of workers is continuously improved. The Party branch has widely organized mass technical learning activities. In the past six months, more than 90% of loading and unloading workers have mastered the operating techniques of one or several machines, and 12% of workers are familiar with the performance of the machines and have learned simple maintenance techniques.
    Fourth, adapt to the improvement of the degree of loading and unloading mechanization and continuously improve enterprise management. This freight yard has carried out several mass discussions and debates on improving enterprise management work, established and improved a series of systems such as "five fixings" (fixed routes, fixed cargo spaces, fixed machinery, fixed cargo types, fixed personnel) and "four no unloadings" (different types of goods are not mixed, bifurcated points are not unloaded, intersections are not unloaded, and arrival and departure cargo spaces are not mixed), strengthened the technical management responsibility system and on-site management, so that the freight yard management is streamlined and systematized, and various types of work and various processes can be carried out simultaneously without interfering with each other, providing good conditions for giving full play to the effectiveness of new machines.

    天津车站西货场依靠群众把技术革命进行到底
    装卸机具不断革新逐步完善
    本报讯　天津铁路车站西货场职工发扬不断革命精神，使许多革新工具由不完善到完善，单项工具搭配成套，充分发挥了装卸机具的效能。现在，在全年货物发送量增长20％的情况下，做到了装卸及时，一车不压。货车在场停留时间，10月份平均为四点八五小时，比1月份缩短了39％。由于劳动生产率提高，还节约出装卸工人一百八十名，占装卸工人总数的45％，实现了“增产减人”的要求。
    西货场的技术革命是从去年12月份开始的，在几天时间内，就制造出大批装卸机具。但是，一些新机具投入生产后，单项作业的效率虽有很大提高，总的装卸效率却下降了，车辆在场停留时间也没有缩短。货场党支部认真地检查了前一阶段的工作，并分析了机具使用率下降的原因：（1）从机具本身来看，主要是性能不够完善，移动不便，特别是未能根据需要及时搭配成套；（2）在提高工人技术水平方面，没有注意引导到自用、自修、自管方面来，只满足于工人会使用；（3）原有的一些管理制度不能适应机械化以后的需要。因此，决定从以下几个方面巩固、扩大技术革命成果：
    首先批判了各种保守思想，为使用、推广新机具开辟道路。新机具投入生产初期，单项作业效率提高了，有些干部就产生了自满松劲情绪，认为：“技术革命差不多了，没什么可搞的了”。当新机具使用一个时期发现了一些毛病之后，少数干部又产生了怀疑动摇情绪，甚至在装卸任务繁重的时候，不采用新机具，仍然采取增加人的办法。为了解决这些思想问题，货场党支部组织职工进行了专题鸣放，批判了保守思想，并且抓住典型事例进行正面教育。比如，过去卸煤电铲不好用，没有很好发动群众，就由少数干部决定改为单人电铲，因为不切合实际，几乎全部闲置起来。后来根据群众的意见加以改进，迅速得到推广。货场党支部就及时地教育干部吸取这个教训。同时，通过技术表演赛，总结推广装卸乙二队和甲二队坚持使用机具、改进机具的经验。
    其次是明确方向，全面规划，选型定型，搭配成套。他们采取领导干部和工人、技术人员“三结合”的办法，对已有的革新机具进行分类排队，选型定型。然后发动群众，有计划地改进一批，推广一批，巩固提高一批。半年来共修复和改进革新机具二百八十四件，并在市内运输部门协作下，修建起高路基、滑溜站台一千三百米，地下传送带三条，高架漏斗五个，使散装货物的装卸机具基本上搭配成套。改进后的新机具，工人使用起来得心应手，效果很好。如卸煤电铲安装了滚珠轴承和大胶轮，移动方便，过去工人不愿用，现在抢着用。特别是把高路基、电铲与地下传送带、高架漏斗衔接起来之后，形成机械联动作业线，从卸火车到装汽车进行不间断作业，不仅使煤、砂线的货位容量提高了四倍，卸火车的效率提高了20％，而且装汽车的时间也缩短了20％左右。
    第三，不断提高工人的技术水平。党支部广泛地组织了群众性的技术学习活动。半年来已有90％以上的装卸工人掌握了一种或几种机具的操作技术，并有12％的工人熟悉了机具性能，学会了简单的维修技术。
    第四，适应装卸机械化程度的提高，不断改进企业管理。这个货场开展过几次改进企业管理工作的群众性鸣放辩论，建立和健全了“五固定”（固定线路、固定货位、固定机具，固定货种、固定人员）、“四不卸”（不同品种货物不混卸、岔尖不卸，道口不卸，到发货位不混卸）等一系列的制度，加强了技术管理责任制和现场管理，使货场管理作到了条理化、制度化，各工种、各工序同时作业，互不干扰，为充分发挥新机具的效能提供了良好条件。（附图片）
