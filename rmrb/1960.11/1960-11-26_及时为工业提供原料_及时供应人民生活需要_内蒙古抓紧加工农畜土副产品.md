According to the Inner Mongolia Daily: A mass movement of processing agricultural, livestock, native, and sideline products is gradually unfolding in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The scope, variety, and quantity of processing are increasing day by day; the processing volume of flax, wild fibers, and wild seeds has increased by 21% to three times compared with the same period last year.

While actively selling agricultural, livestock, native, and sideline products to the state, people's communes in various regions are relying on their own efforts, making use of simple and crude methods, and establishing more than 5,000 processing plants and professional teams to carry out the preliminary processing of agricultural, livestock, native, and sideline products. In order to process harvested crops and wild plants into fibers and starch to meet the needs of people's lives and industrial production in a timely manner, the Chengjisihan People's Commune in Butha Banner organized women and auxiliary laborers to set up 65 small-scale, indigenous fiber and starch production plants, trained more than 70 technicians, and has already processed more than 20 kinds of products. In order to speed up the processing progress, many communes have adopted the method of seizing every opportunity, utilizing mornings, evenings, and rainy and snowy days, and organizing part of the labor force and a large number of women and auxiliary laborers to carry out crash processing. The Wulan'erge Management Area of the Guiliuhe Commune in Kezuoqian Banner also organized various processing plants to carry out competitions, and the processing volume increased daily.

In the process of processing agricultural, livestock, native, and sideline products, various regions have actively improved processing machinery. Aohan Banner has created and reformed eight sets and forty-two pieces of grain, oil, and feed processing machinery, such as donkey-pulled double mills, which generally increased production efficiency by five to eight times, increased the processing volume by 50% compared with the same period last year, and also saved a large number of labor forces for agricultural production.

Many regions comprehensively utilize the roots, stems, leaves, seeds, and fruits of domestic and wild plants, as well as the bones, blood, skin, and hair of animals, to produce a variety of products such as starch, oils, fibers, pesticides, indigenous fertilizers, tannin extract, maltose, wine, soy sauce, and pulp. Taipusi Banner uses methods such as steaming, water immersion, and water retting to process flax stalks into fibers, and also extracts tannin extract, humic acid, and other products from the waste liquid from fiber production.

Local industrial and commercial departments actively assist the people's communes in their processing of agricultural, livestock, native, and sideline products in terms of technology and equipment. The Tongliao Native Products Station organized fourteen working groups to travel around and impart technologies such as fiber degumming, weaving, and boiling, increasing the variety of processing in various communes from twenty-one to forty-seven. Baotou Cotton Mill also sent more than 200 employees to various communes in Guyang to help process flax fibers.

    内蒙古抓紧加工农畜土副产品
    本报讯　据内蒙古日报消息：一个群众性的农畜土副产品加工运动，正在内蒙古自治区各地逐步展开。加工的范围、品种和数量，日益增多；胡麻、野生纤维、野生籽实的加工量比去年同期增长了21％到三倍。
    各地人民公社在积极向国家交售农畜土副产品的同时，自力更生，因陋就简，办起五千多个加工厂和专业队，进行农畜土副产品的初步加工工作。布特哈旗成吉思汗人民公社为使收获的农作物、野生植物初步加工成纤维和淀粉，及时供应人民生活和工业生产的需要，组织妇女和辅助劳动力办起小型土法生产纤维和淀粉的厂子六十五个，培训出七十多名技术人员，已经加工出二十多种产品。许多公社为加快加工进度，采取见缝插针的办法，利用早晚和雨雪天，组织部分劳动力和大批妇女、辅助劳动力，大搞突击加工。科右前旗归流河公社乌兰尔格管理区还组织各加工厂开展竞赛，加工量日增。
    各地在农畜土副产品加工过程中，积极改进加工机具。敖汉旗创制和改革了驴拉双磨等八套四十二件粮谷、油料和饲料加工机具，一般提高生产效率五至八倍，加工量比去年同期增加了50％，还节约了大批劳动力投入农业生产。
    不少地区综合利用家生和野生植物的根、茎、叶、籽实和动物的骨、血、皮、毛，制成了淀粉、油脂、纤维、农药、土化肥、栲胶、饴糖、酒、酱油和纸浆等多种产品。太仆寺旗用蒸煮、水浸、水沤等办法，把胡麻秆加工成纤维，又从制纤维的废液中提炼出了栲胶、胡敏酸等产品。
    各地工商部门积极从技术、设备方面帮助人民公社做好农畜土副产品加工工作。通辽土产站组织十四个工作组，巡回传授纤维脱胶、编织和熬制等技术，使各公社加工品种由二十一种增加到四十七种。包头棉纺厂也派出二百多名职工到固阳各公社，帮助加工胡麻纤维。
