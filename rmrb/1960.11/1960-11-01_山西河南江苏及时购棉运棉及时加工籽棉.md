Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 31st. Shanxi Province's cotton-producing areas are comprehensively arranging cotton picking, purchasing, processing, and transportation. Purchase volumes are rising, and processed lint is being loaded and shipped.

Shanxi has made comprehensive arrangements for "Three Autumns" labor in various regions. Jishan County, a key cotton-producing county, organized a 17,000-strong professional cotton-picking team to pick, dry, and sell cotton as it is harvested. The county's four cotton processing factories simultaneously purchase, process, and transport cotton, quickly transporting more than 570,000 jin of lint to nearby textile mills. Yuncheng County's people's communes organized more than 1,500 carts to transport cotton, and most of the newly picked cotton in the county has been sent to processing factories.

Commercial departments have dispatched a large number of cadres and grading technicians to work in the production teams to facilitate the sale of new cotton by the masses. At the same time, they have trained 50,000 cotton grading technicians for the people's communes in various regions to ensure the quality of purchased cotton.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 31st. The broad masses of commune members in the cotton-producing areas of Henan Province are seizing the period of peak cotton blooming, actively picking and selling new cotton. Xinxiang, Nanyang, Taikang, and other major cotton-producing counties and cities have picked 85% of the cotton that has opened. The picked cotton has been promptly sold to the state.

All major cotton-producing areas have extracted a certain amount of labor to form specialized cotton-picking and selling teams, implementing a combination of regular picking by specialized teams and mass shock picking, and a combination of all-day picking and afternoon rush transportation and sales to ensure timely picking and timely sales.

People's communes in various regions pay great attention to the quality of cotton picking, regularly conduct inspections and comparisons, and promote advanced experiences, striving for careful and meticulous picking, distinguishing grades clearly. Many communes have basically achieved no loss of fiber from the plant, no loss of petals from the fiber, no loss of cotton on the road, and every boll returning to the granary.

Commercial departments have increased the number of purchasing stations and points and have also improved purchasing methods. Some areas have also set up mobile purchasing groups to purchase cotton at the team and field levels. Various regions have also tried to locate processing factories and purchasing stations together, reducing transportation links.

This newspaper, Nanjing, 31st. In conjunction with the autumn planting upsurge, cotton-producing areas in Jiangsu Province are properly scheduling labor and tools, rushing to pick, dry, gin, and transport cotton, and actively accelerating the progress of cotton purchasing.

Yancheng, Nantong, Suzhou, and other major cotton-producing areas have linked up at all levels, from special districts to special districts, counties to counties, and communes to communes, to carry out cotton-selling competitions. In the counterpart competition between Dongtai County and Dafeng County, after Dafeng County learned that Dongtai County had completed its October cotton sales plan 13 days ahead of schedule, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee personally supervised the battle and quickly caught up. Six members of the County Party Committee led a large number of key personnel, divided into five groups, and went deep into the cotton-producing areas to mobilize the masses from picking to selling, linking each link tightly. The Xinfeng Commune of this county focused on short-distance transportation, organizing 197 small carts, earthen carts, 208 bicycles, 370 carrying poles, and dozens of wooden boats, dispatching a 1,200-person cotton transportation shock team. On October 17th, it sold 230,000 jin of new cotton. The County Party Committee used Xinfeng Commune as a model to organize competitions between communes and teams. The daily cotton purchase volume in the county was 2,800 dan in mid-October, but by the 22nd it had increased to more than 14,000 dan, basically achieving no white cotton in the fields and no stored cotton in the warehouses.
