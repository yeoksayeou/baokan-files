Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 3rd. Workers in the West Mining Area of Du'erping Coal Mine under the Taiyuan Xishan Mining Bureau, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, have broken the old convention that workface "relocation" "inevitably reduces production", and a new situation has emerged in which production has increased significantly during three consecutive "relocations". Compared with the total output of coal in the same period before the relocation, the total output of coal during these three relocations increased by 44%, 36%, and 22% respectively.

The significant increase in production when relocating coal mining workfaces (moving production sites) is the result of a revolution in production management at this coal mine, and it plays a significant role in ensuring sustained high coal production.

One of the characteristics of coal production is that the production location frequently moves. After mining one workface, it is necessary to relocate to a new workface to continue production. In the past, whenever Xishan Mining Bureau encountered the transition between old and new workfaces, the common saying was: "How can you produce coal when you relocate?" When arranging plans, the planning departments naturally had to take this "unfavorable factor" into account in advance, and whoever relocated would have their task indicators lowered accordingly. Therefore, "relocation inevitably reduces production" has become a conclusion or "convention" in people's minds and in enterprise management.

At the end of July this year, when the West Three Workface of the Zhuangzhi Coal Mining Team was about to be completed, people were again worried about production reduction due to relocation. In response to this situation, the Party General Branch of the mining area boldly mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and thoroughly checked and analyzed the team's relocation work in May, and found that the reason for the production reduction during this relocation was mainly because the relocation to the next workface only started after one workface was completed. The preparation work for the relocation was delayed, so the equipment was not well prepared, and the workers needed to become familiar with the coal properties and roof conditions at the new workface, which led to production reduction. After a comprehensive and in-depth analysis and research on the relationship between relocation and production, the Du'erping Mining Area of Xishan Mining Bureau believed that relocation is an important production preparation work for coal mining. If the preparation work for relocation is done in a timely manner, it can break the convention of "relocation inevitably reduces production" and turn the unfavorable factor of relocation into a favorable factor for increasing production. There are two reasons for this: First, after the initial relocation, the roof pressure of the new workface is not high, so it is not necessary to release the roof after a few cycles, and the number of times the scraper conveyor is moved is also reduced, which means more coal can be produced; second, relocation is the transition between old and new workfaces, and as long as the arrangements are made skillfully, a coal mining team can change from producing on one workface to producing on two workfaces during relocation. Therefore, they decided to adopt the method of grasping current production with one hand and preparing for the next step with the other, so as to advance the relocation work by one step. Before the production work of the first workface was completed, they began to prepare for the relocation to the new workface, so that during the transition from the old workface to the new workface, both production and relocation were carried out simultaneously. In this way, before the coal from the first workface has been completely extracted, the production preparation work for the second workface has been completed, and the old and new workfaces can produce coal together, which can greatly increase coal production. After they are familiar with the coal properties and roof conditions of the new workface, and the machines of the new workface have been stabilized after actual use, they can then concentrate all their manpower to eliminate the remaining coal in the old workface, and then transfer all of them to the new workface.

    太原杜儿坪煤矿西采区职工充分发挥主观能动性
    打破常规　换新掌子面也增产
    新华社太原3日电　太原西山矿务局杜儿坪矿西采区职工，在增产节约运动中，打破了掌子面“搬家”“必减产”的旧常规，出现连续三次“搬家”都大幅度增产的新局面。这三次搬家期间煤的总产量与搬家前同期总产量比较，分别增长44％、36％、22％。
    采煤掌子面搬家（移动生产场地）做到大增产，是这个煤矿在生产管理工作上进行革命的结果，它对保证煤炭生产持续高产有很大的作用。
    煤炭生产的特点之一，是生产地点经常移动，每采完一个掌子面，就得搬家到新掌子面继续生产。过去，西山矿务局每遇新旧掌子面交替，人们共同的说法是：“搬家那能出煤”？计划部门在安排计划时，也理所当然地要事先把这个“不利因素”打算进去，谁家搬家，就给谁家把任务指标订低一些。因此“搬家必减产”，这在人们的思想上和在企业管理上，已成为一种定论或“常规”。
    今年7月底，壮志采煤队的西三工作面快采完的时候，人们又很担心因搬家而减产。针对这种情况，采区党总支放手发动群众，依靠群众，踏实细致地对这个队5月份的搬家工作进行了一次彻底的检查分析，发现这次搬家减产的原因主要是由于在一个掌子面采完后，才开始往下一个掌子面搬，搬家的准备工作作的迟，因而设备准备不好，工人到新掌子面又需要有个熟悉煤性、顶板的过程，于是形成了减产。西山矿务局杜儿坪矿采区在全面、深入地分析研究了搬家和生产的关系后，认为搬家是采煤的一项重要生产准备工作，搬家的准备工作及时做好，就可以打破“搬家必减产”这个常规，就可以把搬家这个不利因素变为增产的有利因素。根据有二：第一，初搬了家，新的掌子面顶压不大，采几个循环不放顶，移溜子的次数也少，正好多出煤；第二，搬家是新旧掌子面交替，只要巧作安排，一个采煤队可以由平时一个掌子面生产变为搬家时两个掌子面生产。于是他们决定采取一手抓当前生产，一手抓下步准备的方法，把搬家工作提前一步。在没有结束第一个掌子面生产工作的时候，就开始做往新掌子面搬家的准备工作，使由旧掌子面到新掌子面的交替过程中，既生产又搬家。这样，第一个掌子面的煤还没有出完，第二个掌子面的生产准备工作已经做好，新旧掌子面就可以一齐出煤，这就可以使煤产量大幅度增长。当他们对新掌子面的煤性、顶板熟悉了，新掌子面的机器也经过实际使用稳定下来以后，再集中全部人力歼灭旧掌子面的存煤，然后全部转入新掌子面。
