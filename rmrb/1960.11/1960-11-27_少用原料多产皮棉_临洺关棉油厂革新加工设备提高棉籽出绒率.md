Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th. The Linmingguan Cotton Oil Factory in Yongnian County, Hebei Province, used indigenous methods to innovate cotton oil processing equipment, achieving continuous production and replacing heavy manual labor such as manual handling, treading in boxes, and packaging with machinery. As a result, labor was reduced by more than half, freeing up 346 workers to support agriculture, and significantly improving the factory's production level. From mid-September to early November, the factory's hourly output of seed cotton processing and short-fiber ginning exceeded the state plan. The quality of processed cotton was also higher than last year. In the past two months, due to the increased seed cotton output rate and cottonseed lint yield, the same amount of raw materials produced more than 16,000 jin of cotton for the country.

The Linmingguan Cotton Oil Factory is responsible for processing one-third of the county's cotton oil. Before the new cotton came on the market, the factory arranged equipment maintenance and, addressing the problems of high labor consumption, heavy manual labor, and discontinuous production, launched a major technical innovation campaign. Under the leadership of the factory's Technical Innovation Committee, the entire factory organized 110 workers into eleven maintenance and innovation teams, assigning tasks according to the process and implementing maintenance and innovation projects to individuals. From July to early September, all of the factory's more than 30 major processing and power machines were completely repaired, and the entire production process, from seed cotton transportation, cleaning, processing into cotton, to boxing and packaging, was closely linked for continuous production, eliminating heavy physical labor in the cotton oil processing production process. In addition, a cotton purchasing station was established within the factory, contracting the cotton purchasing and processing tasks for the four communes of Linmingguan, Zhoucun, and Ruzuo near the factory. Because preparations were made comprehensively from technical equipment and production technology to the organization and leadership of purchasing and processing before the new cotton came on the market, the factory was able to purchase, process, and transport cotton in a timely manner. Of the more than two million jin of cotton processed after the new cotton came on the market, 94% has been packaged and shipped out of the factory in a timely manner.

    少用原料多产皮棉
    临洺关棉油厂革新加工设备提高棉籽出绒率
    新华社天津26日电　河北永年县临洺关棉油厂用土办法革新棉油加工设备，实现了连续化生产，用机械代替了人工搬运、踩箱、打包等笨重劳动。结果，劳力节约一半以上，抽出三百四十六名工人支援农业，并且使本厂生产水平大大提高。从9月中旬到11月上旬，全厂籽棉加工、剥制短绒的台时产量都超过国家计划，加工的皮棉质量也比去年提高，近两个月中，由于籽棉出品率、棉籽出绒率提高，用同样多的原料为国家增产了皮棉一万六千多斤。
    临洺关棉油厂担负着全县三分之一的棉油加工任务。早在新棉上市以前，工厂就安排了设备检修工作，并针对加工用人多、笨重劳动多、生产不连续等问题，大搞技术革新。在工厂技术革新委员会领导下，全厂组织了一百一十名工人，分成十一个检修革新小组，按工序分配了任务，按人落实了检修和革新项目。从7月份到9月上旬，全厂三十多台主要加工和动力机器就全部检修完毕，并且使籽棉运送、清花、加工成皮棉、装箱、打包等整个生产过程紧密衔接，连续生产，消灭了棉油加工生产过程中的笨重体力劳动。另外，还在厂内设立棉花收购站，包下了工厂附近临洺关、周村、茹佐等四个公社的棉花收购、加工任务。因为在新棉上市以前，就从技术设备、生产工艺到收购加工的组织领导等方面全面作好了准备，全厂就作到了随收购、随加工、随调运。在新棉上市以后加工的二百多万斤皮棉，已经有94％及时打包调运出厂。
