    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The vanguards of groundwater development in the five northern provinces—the staff of the exploration departments—are actively exploring groundwater to provide water sources for large-scale agriculture. According to preliminary estimates based on extensive exploration by exploration personnel and long-term observations by the masses in recent years, especially this year, relevant departments believe that groundwater resources are abundant in the five provinces of Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Shaanxi. About half of the cultivated land in the plains and intermountain basins of these five provinces can be irrigated using groundwater.
    This year, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Shaanxi provinces have strengthened groundwater exploration. Currently, exploration personnel active on the North China Plain, the Guanzhong Plain, the Fen River Plain, and the Weibei Plateau have initially determined the specific distribution of groundwater resources in many places and have compiled a batch of hydrogeological maps for farmland irrigation in counties and cities, including all counties in the plain areas of Hebei Province; more than 20 counties in Shanxi Province such as Pingyao and Yingxian; five counties and cities in Henan Province such as Zhengzhou and Anyang; and counties in Shandong Province such as Yuncheng.
    In the process of exploring groundwater, all localities have implemented the principle of combining exploration with development. On the one hand, they extensively collect hydrogeological data obtained from the mass well-drilling movement to accelerate exploration. On the other hand, they allocate some drilling rigs to drill wells, thereby obtaining exploration data and accelerating the development of groundwater. According to statistics from the exploration departments of Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces, these regions have drilled more than 1,000 machine-operated wells this year in conjunction with exploration, many of which are artesian wells known as "Happiness Springs" by the masses.
    The five northern provinces located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River are one of China's main grain and cotton producing areas and also the earliest regions to develop and utilize groundwater. As early as the Zhou Dynasty, there were wells here. Farmers in these areas have deeply realized the many benefits of using groundwater for irrigation through long-term cultivation and struggle against drought, such as: convenient extraction, stable water volume, and relatively reliable drought-resistant water source; good water quality, which can wash away salt and alkali when irrigating saline-alkali land, and prevent salinization when irrigating general land. Therefore, since the Great Leap Forward, many underground water sources have been developed in various places during the water conservancy movement, and they have played a significant role in the drought resistance struggle in the past two years. Due to the good development and utilization of groundwater, Hejian in Hebei and Yuncheng in Shanxi, and other counties, still achieved good harvests of grain crops this year despite the severe drought.
    Recently, the Ministry of Geology convened a working conference on groundwater exploration and development in the seven provinces and autonomous regions of Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia, as well as Beijing. The relevant departments in these regions are currently actively formulating plans for further groundwater exploration and development and strengthening groundwater exploration and development.

    开发地下水  保证好收成
    山西、山东、河南、河北、陕西地质人员广泛勘探水源
    据新华社讯　北方五省开发地下水的尖兵——勘探部门的职工们，积极勘探地下水，为大办农业提供水源。有关部门根据几年特别是今年勘探人员广泛勘探和广大群众长期观测初步估算，山西、山东、河南、河北、陕西五省地下水资源丰富。这五省的平原和山间盆地约有一半左右的耕地，可以利用地下水浇灌。
    今年，山西、山东、河南、河北、陕西等省都加强了地下水的勘探工作。目前，活跃在华北平原、关中平原，汾河平原和渭北高原上的勘探人员，已初步摸清不少地方地下水资源分布的具体状况，并且已经编制出一批县、市的农田灌溉水文地质图，其中包括河北省平原地区各县；山西省平遥、应县等二十多个县；河南省郑州、安阳等五县市以及山东省的郓城等县。
    各地在勘探地下水的过程中，贯彻勘探与开发相结合的原则，一方面广泛搜集群众打井运动中所得的水文地质资料，加快勘探；一方面抽出部分钻机打井，从而既获得了勘探资料，又加快了地下水的开发。据河北、河南、山西、山东、陕西等省勘探部门统计，这些地区结合勘探，今年已打成机井一千多眼，其中有不少是被群众称作“幸福泉”的自流井。
    位于黄河中、下游的北方五省，是我国主要粮棉产区之一，也是开展利用地下水的最早的地区，早在周代这里就有了井。这些地区的农民从长期耕种和向旱灾作斗争的实践中，深深体会到用地下水灌田有很多好处，如：开采方便，水量稳定，抗旱水源比较可靠；水质也好，浇盐碱地可以浇去盐碱，浇一般地可以防止盐碱化等。因此，大跃进以来，各地在水利化运动中就开发了不少的地下水源，并且在近两年的抗旱斗争中都发挥了很大作用。河北的河间和山西的运城等县，由于地下水开发利用得好，今年在特大干旱的情况下，粮食作物仍获得了好收成。
    最近，地质部召开了山西、山东、河南、河北、陕西、甘肃、内蒙古七个省、区和北京市的勘探开发地下水工作会议，这些地区的有关部门目前都在积极制订进一步勘探开发地下水的规划，加强地下水的勘探、开发工作。
