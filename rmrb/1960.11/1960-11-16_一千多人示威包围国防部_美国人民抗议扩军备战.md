    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: More than a thousand demonstrators in Washington protested against the US government's arms race policy on the 13th and 14th consecutively.
    The demonstrators surrounded the US Department of Defense—the Pentagon—and set up picket lines. They came to Washington from all over the United States to participate in the large-scale march against military expansion and war preparations, which was organized by the "Quaker Society."
    The organizing committee of the large-scale march issued an appeal, demanding that the US government stop producing nuclear, chemical, and bacteriological weapons, and demanding the destruction of stored chemical and bacteriological weapons and the raw materials for manufacturing these weapons.
    The appeal also called for cuts in US appropriations for foreign military "aid."
    Although this demonstration was a peaceful one, the US authorities dispatched a police motorcycle team to the vicinity of the Pentagon to "maintain order."

    一千多人示威包围国防部
    美国人民抗议扩军备战
    新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：一千多名示威者在13日和14日接连在华盛顿示威，抗议美国政府的军备竞赛政策。
    示威者包围了美国国防部——五角大楼，并且布置了纠察线。他们是从美国各地到华盛顿来参加反对扩军备战的大游行的，这次大游行是由“教友会”组织的。
    大游行的组织委员会发表了呼吁书，要求美国政府停止生产核武器、化学武器和细菌武器，并且要求把储存的化学武器和细菌武器以及制造这些武器的原料销毁。
    呼吁书还要求削减美国对外军事“援助”的拨款。
    尽管这次示威是一次和平示威，美国当局却出动了警察的摩托车队到五角大楼周围去“维持秩序”。
