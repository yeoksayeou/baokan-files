    Everyone Strives to Be a Promoter of Large-Scale Agriculture
    Gengzhen Commune in Wutai County Comprehensively Implements the "Incidental Labor" System
    All Sectors Strive to Participate in Agricultural Production in Conjunction with Their Work

    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 12th) The Gengzhen People's Commune in Wutai County, Shanxi, is vigorously promoting "incidental labor," which has boosted current production.

    The "incidental labor" promoted by the Gengzhen Commune is being carried out in three aspects: First, all factories, farms, forestry farms, pig farms, offices, schools, and other units affiliated with the commune, in addition to supporting the agricultural front line through their own operations, are also directly and indirectly transferring labor to support agriculture by linking up with various management districts (basic accounting units). From January to August, these units directly contributed more than 9,900 labor days to agriculture. The Xianglusi area had thirty mu of remote land that could not be cultivated, so the nearby commune's mountain product processing factory took over the entire process from cultivation to harvest. In the past, these units had to draw agricultural labor for repairing houses, but now they do it themselves. In eight months, the commune built 304 pig pens, 90 houses, and 30 school buildings. Except for a few carpenters, all the work was done by workers, cadres, and students themselves, saving approximately more than 10,000 labor days for the rural areas. This year, of the production materials and agricultural and sideline products supplied and purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative to the management districts, more than 130,000 jin were delivered and picked up by themselves, saving 1,330 rural labor days. Second, among the managers, cooks, child care workers, feeders, inseminators, shepherds, and other personnel of various specialized teams under the management district, the method of "several combinations" is generally adopted to support agricultural production as much as possible. For example, shepherds implement "four combinations," that is, incidentally managing remote slopes, incidentally cutting grass and collecting wild vegetables; if the sheep do not leave the flock in the morning, they carry water for the canteen, and if the sheep are in the river ditch and do not go up the mountain in the afternoon, two shepherds will draw one person to do farm work in the nearby fields. In this way, from January to August this year, 864 professional personnel in 34 management districts contributed more than 75,000 labor days to agriculture, averaging 99 agricultural labor days per person; and in the "Three Autumns" work, through
  the incidental labor of "several combinations" and the active support of 1,800 middle and primary school teachers and students who were given leave to return home, 36,850 labor days were added to agriculture. Third, for the large number of laborers on the agricultural production front line, the slogan of "Don't walk empty on the land, don't go home empty-handed" was put forward, and the implementation of "three bringings and five incidentals" on the land, that is, bringing a sickle (to cut grass), a hoe (to dig yams), a basket (to carry yams), and incidentally applying manure to wheat fields, carrying soil back (to line the pens for fertilizer accumulation), carrying grass, carrying firewood, and carrying crops. In the first half of September alone, more than 300 canteens and horse sheds were built, and more than one million jin of grass were cut through "three bringings and five incidentals." These two items alone can be converted into more than 40,300 labor days.

    The reason why the incidental labor of Gengzhen Commune can be carried out comprehensively and continuously is mainly because it has strengthened political and ideological education, and repeatedly and deeply explained to the broad masses of commune members that doing more work is both beneficial to the collective and beneficial to the individual, so that the commune members have further established a socialist labor attitude.

    人人争当大办农业促进派
    五台县耿镇公社全面推行“捎带劳动”制度
    各行各业结合业务争先参加农业生产
    本报太原12日电　山西五台县耿镇人民公社大力推行“捎带劳动”，促进了当前生产。
    耿镇公社推行的“捎带劳动”是从三个方面开展的：第一，公社所属各工厂、农场、林场、猪场、机关、学校等单位，除通过本身业务支援农业生产第一线外，还以和各管理区（基本核算单位）挂钩的形式，直接和间接地抽调劳力支援农业。1至8月，这些单位直接向农业投工九千九百多个劳动日。香炉寺有三十亩远地种不过来，就由附近的公社山货加工厂从耕种到秋收，全部包下来。过去这些单位修理房舍，大部要抽调农业劳动力，现在都自己动手。八个月内，公社盖猪圈三百零四间，住房九十间，校舍三十间，除用几个木工外，全是工人、干部、学生自己动手搞的，共节省农村劳动力约一万多个劳动日。今年供销社向管理区供应和收购的生产资料、农副产品中，有十三万多斤都是自己送、取的，光这一项就节约农村劳动力一千三百三十个。第二，在管理区所属各种专业队的管理员、炊事员、保育员、饲养员、配种员、牧工等人员中，普遍采用“几结合”的办法，尽量支援农业生产。比如，牧工实行“四结合”，即捎着经营远坡地，捎带打草和采集野菜；早上羊不出群就给食堂担水，下午羊在河沟不上山，两个牧工就抽一人到附近地里干农活。这样，今年1至8月，三十四个管理区的八百六十四个专业人员，向农业投工七万五千多个，每人平均做农业劳动日九十九个；而且在“三秋”工作中，通过
  “几个结合”的捎带劳动和一千八百名放假返乡的中、小学师生的积极支援，为农业增加了三万六千八百五十个劳动日。第三，对农业生产第一线的大批劳力，提出“上地不空走，回家不空手”的口号，实行上地“三带五捎”，即出地带镰（割草）、镢（刨山药）、筐（背山药），捎带给麦田上粪，回来背土（垫圈积肥）。背草、背柴和背庄稼。9月上半月仅通过“三带五捎”，就修起食堂、马棚三百多间，打草一百多万斤。仅这两项，就可折合四万零三百多个劳动日。
    耿镇公社的捎带劳动所以能够全面而又持续地搞起来，主要是加强了政治思想教育工作，反复深入地向广大社员说明了多作活既对集体有利，又对个人有利，使社员进一步树立了社会主义的劳动态度。
