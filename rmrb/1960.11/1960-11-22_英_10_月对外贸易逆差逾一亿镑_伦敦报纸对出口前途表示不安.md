Xinhua News Agency, London, electric dispatch - According to preliminary figures released by the British Board of Trade on the 14th, Britain's foreign trade deficit in October reached 110 million pounds, while the average monthly deficit in the first half of this year was 62.2 million pounds.

    Britain's exports in October were valued at 257 million pounds, while the average export value in the third quarter was 371 million pounds, in the second quarter 300 million pounds, and in the first quarter 306 million pounds. Imports in October were valued at 379 million pounds, and re-exports at 12 million pounds.

    The "Financial Times," in discussing factors that will affect Britain's foreign trade prospects, pointed out that the first factor is that Europe's "prosperity" appears to be declining, with industrial output and exports leveling off or decreasing; the second factor is that raw material producing countries' exports are no longer rising, so they may soon have to restrict imports. The "Financial Times" said that the third factor is the concern that the new US government will try to continue its export drive, thereby "intensifying the overall pressure of competition." The "Daily Telegraph," in commenting on this issue, said that regarding the export record, "we have ample reason to be uneasy."

    英10月对外贸易逆差逾一亿镑
    伦敦报纸对出口前途表示不安
    据新华社伦敦电　据英国贸易部14日公布的初步数字，英国10月份对外贸易逆差达一亿一千万英镑，而今年上半年每月平均逆差是六千二百万镑。
    英国10月份出口值为两亿五千七百万镑，而第三季度出口值的平均数是三亿七千一百万英镑，第二季度是三亿英镑，第一季度是三亿零六百万英镑。10月份进口值为三亿七千九百万镑，再出口值为一千两百万镑。
    “金融时报”谈到将影响英国对外贸易前途的因素时指出，第一个因素是，欧洲“繁荣”看来正在衰退，工业产量和出口正在趋平或下降；第二个因素是，原料生产国的出口量不再上升，因此它们可能很快就不得不限制进口。“金融时报”说，第三个因素是，人们担心，美国的新政府将设法继续它的出口运动，从而“加强竞争的全面压力”。“每日电讯报”在评论这个问题时说，对于出口记录，“我们有充分的理由感到不安”。
