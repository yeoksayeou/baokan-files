    Getting to the Bottom of Things
    Yu Yang
    No matter what work we are doing, we cannot be satisfied with superficial phenomena and existing achievements. We should get to the bottom of things to understand them thoroughly, so as to further promote them, improve them, and raise them step by step.
    What is the true nature of things, where do they come from, and where are they going? Without a serious and down-to-earth investigation and research, it is impossible to understand them clearly. Only by knowing and understanding things deeply can we do them well. The news published in today's newspaper about the Pingxiang Coal Mine continuously improving labor productivity vividly illustrates this point. In the production increase and economy campaign, the Pingxiang Coal Mine transferred more than 2,000 employees to strengthen the front line of mining, and the mining progress was accelerated accordingly, and the output of raw coal also increased accordingly. In the eyes of ordinary people, the purpose of strengthening the front line has been achieved. However, the leading cadres of this mine were not satisfied with the existing achievements. They adopted the method of following shifts to conduct investigations and research on the actual production situation. As a result, they found that although the mining progress had been greatly accelerated and the output of raw coal had increased, judging from the average work efficiency and labor productivity, some work teams had not achieved the due improvement, and individual work teams had even declined compared with the past. What is the reason for this? They sought the "root" and investigated the "bottom," and came to the conclusion: after a large number of laborers were concentrated on the front line, some were not used in the most needed places for production, and the labor potential and expertise of some people had not been fully utilized. The arrival of production personnel on the front line does not mean the end of the matter, but the beginning of the matter. After the production personnel arrive on the front line, they still need to be further examined: whether the labor force is properly arranged, whether labor efficiency has been improved, and whether the daily output of raw coal can be increased further. Only by clarifying these situations can we further discover problems and improve labor organization better and further improve labor productivity.
    With the spirit of "getting to the bottom of things," we can constantly promote the development of work. Seeking the root and investigating the bottom once, we can discover some problems, improve the work to a higher level, and do things better. After the Pingxiang Coal Mine improved its labor organization and labor efficiency was generally improved, after another round of seeking the root and investigating the bottom, it was found that there was still a big difference between groups. In order to eliminate the differences, a high-efficiency labor competition of establishing pacesetters and planting red flags was launched, and high-efficiency groups of "one top two" and "one top three" emerged in large numbers, and the labor efficiency of the entire mine was raised to a new level.
     "Getting to the bottom of things" is the realistic and pragmatic scientific attitude that Marxists should have towards anything, and it is the down-to-earth and solid work style that every revolutionary worker should have towards any work. This work style is necessary for doing every job well.

    寻根究底
    于羊
    无论对待什么工作，都不能满足于表面现象和已有成就。而应当追根究底地了解清楚，以便进一步地去推动它，提高它，步步提高。
    事情的本来面目怎么样，它从何而来，又将往何而去？没有一番认真的踏实的调查研究工夫，是不可能弄得很清楚的。只有对事情本身深知深解以后，才会把它办好。今天本报发表的萍乡煤矿不断提高劳动生产效率的消息，就生动地说明了这个问题。萍乡煤矿在增产节约运动中抽调了两千多名职工去加强采掘第一线，采掘进度也就随之加快了，原煤产量也就随之上升了。这在一般人看来，加强第一线的目的是已经达到了的。可是，这个矿的领导干部没有满足于已有的成就，他们采取跟班劳动的办法，对生产实际进行了调查研究，结果发现了：采掘进度虽然大大地加快了，原煤产量虽然上升了，但是，从平均工效和劳动生产率来检查，有的班组却并没有得到应有的提高，个别的班组反而比过去下降了。这是什么原因呢？他们寻了“根”，究了“底”，得出了结论：原来劳动力大批集中到第一线以后，有些没有用到生产最需要的地方去，还有部分人的劳动潜力和专长没有得到充分发挥。生产人员到了第一线，绝不等于事情的完结，而是事情的开始。生产人员到了第一线以后，还需要继续加以考查：劳动力是否安排得当，劳动效率是否有了提高，原煤的日产量是否还可以再增多一点。弄清了这些情况，才可能更深一步地发现问题，使劳动组织，得到更好的改善，进一步提高劳动生产率。
    有“寻根究底”的精神，才能不断促进工作发展。寻一次根究一次底，就可以发现一些问题，把工作再提高一步，把事情办得更好。萍乡煤矿在改进了劳动组织，劳动效率普遍提高以后，经过又一番寻根究底，又发现了小组与小组之间还有很大差别。为了消除差别，一个大树标兵，大插红旗的高工效劳动竞赛就展开了，“一顶二”、“一顶三”的高效率小组就大批地涌现出来了，全矿的劳动效率又提高到了一个新的水平。
     “寻根究底”是马克思主义者对待任何事物所应有的实事求是的科学态度，是每个革命工作者对待任何工作都应有的脚踏实地、扎扎实实的工作作风。这种作风，是做好每一件工作所必需的。
