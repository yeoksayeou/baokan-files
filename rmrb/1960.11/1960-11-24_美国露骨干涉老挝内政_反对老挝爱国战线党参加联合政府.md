Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 23rd: The U.S. government continues to crudely interfere in Laos' internal affairs, openly opposing the establishment of a coalition government in Laos with the participation of the Pathet Lao.

State Department spokesman White threatened reporters on the 22nd that the proposal to form a coalition government with the participation of the Pathet Lao was fraught with "considerable danger." He said that the U.S. ambassador to Laos is currently doing his utmost to obtain the latest intelligence on the situation.

White also made it clear that the United States is continuing to vigorously support the Nosavan rebel group. Under the guise of U.S. "military assistance" being "provided to the Royal Lao Army as a whole," he admitted that the United States is currently providing "military assistance" to the Nosavan rebel group's army.

    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府继续粗暴干涉老挝内政，公开反对在老挝建立有老挝爱国战线党参加的联合政府。
    国务院发言人怀特22日在对新闻记者发表谈话时威胁说，关于成立有老挝爱国战线党参加的联合政府的建议具有“相当大的危险性”。他说，美国驻老挝大使目前正在尽他的最大力量来获得关于局势的最新情报。
    怀特同时表明，美国正在继续大力支持诺萨万叛乱集团。他在美国的“军事援助”是“向作为一个整体的老挝王国军队提供”的幌子下承认，美国目前正向诺萨万叛乱集团军队提供“军事援助”。
