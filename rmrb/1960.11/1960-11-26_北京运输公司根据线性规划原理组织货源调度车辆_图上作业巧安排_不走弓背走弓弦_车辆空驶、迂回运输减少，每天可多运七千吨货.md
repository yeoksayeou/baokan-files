Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: Beijing Transportation Company employees, based on the principles of linear programming, are using on-the-ground planning methods to organize freight and dispatch vehicles, reducing unreasonable phenomena such as vehicle deadheading and circuitous transportation. According to preliminary statistics from the company, in the past two months or so, the use of this method has reduced empty mileage by approximately 10,000 kilometers per day, which is equivalent to transporting an additional 7,000 tons of goods, saving more than 5,000 liters of gasoline.

The on-the-ground planning method involves prioritizing freight shipments based on their urgency and volume flow when creating transportation plans. Suitable freight for circular transportation is grouped together, mathematically calculated, and formed into a circular transportation route. When freight is insufficient, efforts are made to actively find more. Then, a flow diagram of all the company's freight shipments is drawn, and this is used to organize transportation, dispatch vehicles, and allocate loading and unloading workers. This greatly reduces or avoids empty mileage, circuitous transportation, and the phenomenon of "taking the arc instead of the chord" on transportation routes.

The company began using the on-the-ground planning method to dispatch vehicles in late August. Previously, each vehicle could only complete the transportation tasks for one or two shipping units at a time; now, it can complete the transportation tasks for three or even more. For example, the Beijing Automobile Factory, the East Suburb Station, and the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory all needed vehicles from the Jiulongshan Motor Pool. One needed to transport coal, one needed to transport earth for a foundation project, and one needed to transport out earth and transport in bricks and stones. In the past, the dispatcher would have to send vehicles to all three locations. Now, only one vehicle needs to be dispatched to complete the transportation tasks for all three units. The vehicle first goes to the East Suburb Station to transport coal to its destination, then travels three kilometers empty to the brick and stone loading point to load bricks and transport them to the Agricultural Machinery Factory. After unloading the bricks, it loads earth and transports it to the East Suburb Station. Then, it begins the second cycle. In this way, one vehicle completes the tasks that previously required three vehicles.

Based on linear programming principles, various motor pools have also created dozens of new loading and unloading methods, such as centralized loading and unloading and fixed-location circular loading and unloading. These methods generally increase loading and unloading efficiency by about 30%, saving a large amount of loading and unloading labor, reducing the labor intensity of loading and unloading workers, and shortening loading and unloading time by one-fifth. For example, when loading bricks at the brick factory, the Xiaoguan Motor Pool adopted the method of numbering vehicles, grouping loading and unloading workers, and assigning a fixed group to each vehicle number. This improved work efficiency, increasing the amount of bricks loaded per person per day from seven tons to ten tons, and reducing the number of loading workers by half.

In the process of promoting linear programming and on-the-ground planning methods, various motor pools have closely integrated them with improving enterprise management and strengthening internal and external collaboration, formulating systems such as the dispatcher and driver's two-level review of freight and "three checks before arrangement." Before accepting each batch of freight, they first check the freight, check the route, and check the site, then draw it on the map, allocate vehicles, and determine the route for organizing transportation. This minimizes the waste of transport capacity.

Promoting linear programming and on-the-ground planning methods is highly efficient, yields quick results, and does not require spending a penny. Moreover, as long as one has an elementary school education and understands addition and subtraction, one can skillfully master and apply them. With the help of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Science and Technology of China, Beijing Normal University, Peking University, Beijing Normal College, Hebei Normal College, and other institutions, more than 90% of the dispatchers in the company's twelve motor pools, including Jiulongshan, Malian Road, and Qinghe, were able to dispatch vehicles and allocate loading and unloading workers based on the principles of linear programming after just one month.

The Transportation Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an on-site meeting to promote the company's experience.

    北京运输公司根据线性规划原理组织货源调度车辆
    图上作业巧安排  不走弓背走弓弦
    车辆空驶、迂回运输减少，每天可多运七千吨货
    据新华社25日讯　北京市运输公司职工根据线性规划原理，采取图上作业的方法组织货源，调度车辆，减少了车辆空驶、迂回运输等不合理现象。据这个公司初步统计，两个多月来，运用这一方法，每天约可减少一万公里的空驶里程，等于多运七千吨货物，节约五千多公升汽油。
    图上作业法，就是在编制运输计划时，把需要托运的货物分别轻重缓急，根据流量流向进行排队，把适合循环运输的托运物资编在一起，经过数学计算，组成一个循环运输线。遇到货源不足，就积极寻找货源。然后画成全车场托运货物的流量流向图，根据它来组织运输、调度车辆、分配装卸工人。这样，就能大大减少或避免空驶、迂回运输和在运输线上“不走弓弦走弓背”的现象。
    8月下旬，公司开始采用图上作业法来调度车辆。以往，每辆汽车每次只能完成一个、两个托运单位的运输任务，现在已能完成三个以至更多托运单位的运输任务。例如，北京汽车制造厂、东郊车站、北京农业机械厂三个单位，都向九龙山汽车场要车。一个需要运煤块，一个需要运土方填基础工程，一个需要运出土方运进砖石。在过去，调度员要向三方面派车载运。现在，只要向一方面派车就能完成三个单位的托运任务。汽车先到东郊车站，把煤块运到目的地；然后空驶三公里到砖石装卸地点装车，把砖石运到农机厂；卸了砖石以后，又装上土方，运到东郊车站。接着，又开始第二次循环。这样，一辆汽车就完成了以往需要三辆汽车才能完成的任务。
    各个汽车场根据线性规划原理，还创造了集中装卸、固定地点循环装卸等几十种新的装卸方法，一般能提高装卸效率30％左右，节省了大量的装卸劳力，减轻了装卸工人的劳动强度，装卸时间也缩短了五分之一。如小关汽车场在往砖瓦厂装砖时，采取车辆编号、装卸工人编组、每个车号固定小组装卸的方法，提高了工作效率，每人每日装砖量从七吨提高到十吨，装车工人减少了一半。
    各个汽车场在推行线性规划、图上作业法的过程中，都与改进企业管理、加强内外协作密切地结合起来，制订了调度员、司机二级审查货源和“先三查后安排”等制度。他们在接受每批货源前，首先要查货源、查路线、查现场，然后画在图上，配车定线，组织运输。从而最大限度地避免了运力的浪费。
    推行线性规划、图上作业法，效率高、见效快，不需花费一分钱；而且只要小学程度，懂得加、减两种算术，就能熟练地掌握和运用。这个公司所属的九龙山、马连道、清河等十二个汽车场，在中国科学院、中国科学技术大学、北京师范大学、北京大学、北京师范学院、河北师范学院等单位的帮助下，经过短短一个月时间，就有90％以上的调度员能根据线性规划原理调度车辆，分配装卸工人。
    中共北京市委交通工作部最近已经召开现场会议，推广这个公司的经验。
