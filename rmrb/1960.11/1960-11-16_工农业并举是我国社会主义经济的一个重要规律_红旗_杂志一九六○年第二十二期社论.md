Comrade Mao Zedong proposed at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1959 that agriculture should be placed in the primary position in economic issues. This opinion is very important for our socialist construction cause.

As early as January 1934, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his essay "Our Economic Policy" that "Agricultural production is the first priority of our economic construction work." This is a fundamental point of view of Marxists on economic issues. This point of view was not only completely correct during the revolutionary base period, but also completely correct during the socialist construction period. Comrade Mao Zedong has always adhered to this point of view. In his report to the Seventh National Congress of the Party in 1945, he further and comprehensively expounded the importance of peasants in China's political life and the importance of agriculture in the entire national economy. He said:

	"The peasants—these are the predecessors of the Chinese workers. In the future, tens of millions of peasants will enter the cities and factories. If China needs to build a strong national industry and many modern large cities, it will have to go through a long process of transforming the rural population into an urban population.
	The peasants—this is the main body of China's industrial market. Only they can supply the most abundant food and raw materials and absorb the largest amount of industrial products."

After the national liberation, during the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the development of agricultural production must adapt to the needs of the development of socialist industrialization. To achieve this goal, the first step is to realize agricultural cooperation, and the second step is to gradually realize the technical transformation of agriculture following agricultural cooperation.

In his April 1956 speech "On the Ten Major Relationships," Comrade Mao Zedong said the first thing was that we must correctly handle the relationship between agriculture and industry. Subsequently, he sharply raised the issue in his work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." He said: "Our country has a population of more than 500 million peasants. The situation of the peasants is extremely important for the development of our economy and the consolidation of our political power." He summarized the experience of China's First Five-Year Plan and considered the experience of socialist brother countries, believing that in our socialist economic cause, "the development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture," and "heavy industry should take agriculture as an important market," etc. This is a prominent creative new generalization of Marxists on economic issues, and a prominent creative new generalization of Marxists on socialist construction issues. The series of "simultaneous development" policies put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee all start from the basic policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and our experience, especially the experience of the general line of socialist construction since 1958, proves that these policies are completely correct.

The Great Leap Forward and the People's Commune, which appeared under the guidance of the Party's general line, are two great new things in China's socialist construction period. In order to enable China's national economy to continue to maintain the speed of the Great Leap Forward and to continue to maintain proportional development, and in order to give full play to the superiority of the People's Commune, the economic construction agenda requires us to further specify the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under new conditions. The realization of the people's commune has opened up a broader world for the development of agriculture in our country. The requirements of agriculture for mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification are becoming more and more urgent; on the other hand, as far as industry itself is concerned, only by gradually realizing the above series of requirements of agriculture can agriculture provide more and more labor force and more and more grain and raw materials to industry. It is precisely based on this reason that Comrade Mao Zedong emphatically put forward the issue of putting agriculture in the primary position.

Putting agriculture in the primary position is a decisive step that must be taken to promote the continued leap forward of China's national economy. Taking this step will not only not hinder the development of industry, but will greatly promote the continued leap forward of industry. The Party Central Committee believes that the development of China's national economy must be based on agriculture, led by industry, and combine the priority development of heavy industry with the rapid development of agriculture.

Some comrades always regard the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture as two mutually exclusive things. Comrade Mao Zedong criticized this wrong view long ago. In his paper "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," he said: "We must never separate and isolate industry and agriculture, socialist industrialization and socialist agricultural transformation, and we must never emphasize only one aspect and weaken the other. The Soviet experience has also pointed out the direction for us on this issue, but some of our comrades have not paid attention to it, and they always look at these issues in isolation and without contact."

According to the Marxist viewpoint, the priority development of heavy industry and the rapid development of agriculture are mutually conditional, mutually combined, and mutually promoting. Marx made many arguments on the relationship between industry and agriculture under capitalist conditions. For example, he said: "A certain degree of development of domestic agriculture or foreign agriculture is the foundation for the development of capital." ① He also said: "The less time society needs to produce wheat and livestock, etc., the more time it has to carry out other production—material and spiritual production." ② "Agricultural labor productivity exceeding the individual needs of workers is the basis of all societies, especially the basis of capitalist production." ③ The so-called "agricultural labor productivity exceeding the individual needs of workers is the basis of all societies" of course not only refers to class societies, not only capitalist societies, but also socialist societies, and even communist societies.

However, in capitalist society, there are insurmountable contradictions between industry and agriculture. As Lenin said: "The lag in agricultural development behind industry is a phenomenon inherent in all capitalist countries, and is one of the most profound reasons for the disruption of proportions between various sectors of the national economy, the occurrence of crises, and high prices." ④ The United States is the most developed country in capitalist agriculture, and its agriculture has played a huge role in the development of industry; but from the entire history of the development of American capitalism, the development speed of American agriculture is also lagging behind industry, and there has always been a profound and insurmountable contradiction between agriculture and industry.

Engels said: "...Only by establishing a close internal link between industrial production and agricultural production, and expanding the means of transportation along with the needs arising from this—of course, on the premise of abolishing the capitalist mode of production—can the rural population be freed from the state of isolation and ignorance in which they have been almost unchanged for thousands of years." ⑤ There is no doubt that on the basis of socialist public ownership, it is entirely possible to overcome the inherent contradictions between industry and agriculture in capitalist society, completely avoid the phenomenon of agricultural development lagging behind industry in capitalist society, and completely plan to develop agriculture and industry simultaneously and simultaneously, and completely enable industry and agriculture to develop at a high speed that no capitalist country can have; therefore, it is also completely possible to "establish a close internal link between industrial production and agricultural production" as Engels said. This is an important law of socialist economic development.

The policy of "the development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture" put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong is precisely a careful consideration of the close internal link between industry and agriculture under the socialist system, and precisely correctly expresses and grasps the important law of socialist economic development that agriculture needs to advance closely with industry at the same time. Comrade Mao Zedong elucidated this important law of socialist economic development, which has a great guiding role for the advancement of socialist construction in our country. Practice will increasingly prove this role.

Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1959, especially since this year, in order to better implement the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the Party and the state have taken a series of powerful measures to further address the two key issues in agricultural development: one is the issue of rural production relations, mainly to implement a series of rural policies since the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the Zhengzhou Conference, and to continue to adhere to and consolidate the three-level ownership system of the commune based on the production team. The other is the issue of agricultural productivity, mainly to more rationally arrange the labor force in various economic sectors while actively promoting the technical transformation of agriculture, so that the first line of agricultural production maintains and is equipped with a sufficient labor force. It is possible to change the current situation of agricultural development lagging behind the rapid development of industry in a relatively short period of time by further addressing these two issues in a realistic manner, and it will also be conducive to the continued leap forward of industry and other economic sectors.

The development of China's national economy is a unity of the Great Leap Forward and proportional planning. At present, China's economic and technological level is not high, and agricultural technology is still very backward. Under such circumstances, the planned proportional development of China's national economy should pay special attention to the proportion of labor force allocated in various economic sectors, and pay special attention to the proportion of labor force occupied by the agricultural production sector. Rationally arranging this proportion is an important link for us to further implement the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture.

Marx said: "The number of workers who can be invested in industry and commerce without having to engage in agriculture... depends on how much agricultural products agricultural workers can produce in addition to their own consumption." ⑥ This means that how much labor force can be transferred from the agricultural population to engage in industry, commerce and other undertakings is not determined by the needs of these undertakings for labor force, but by the grain and other agricultural products produced by the workers remaining in the field of agricultural production, in addition to meeting the needs of the agricultural population, whether they can meet the needs of the non-agricultural population, and how much they can supply. We must actively promote the technical transformation of agriculture, gradually realize the mechanization, water conservancy, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture, and gradually improve agricultural labor productivity, so as to use much less agricultural labor than it is now to produce much more agricultural products than it is now, so as to gradually extract labor from the agricultural sector to engage in industry, commerce, and other undertakings. However, under the current conditions, China's agriculture cannot immediately fully realize technical modernization, and can only first gradually realize the mechanization of agriculture in some local areas. After the continuous leap forward of the past three years, and after the development of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, great changes have taken place in the use and distribution of labor force in our country. The problem of surplus labor force left over from old China has been completely solved, and a phenomenon of labor force shortage has emerged. This situation reflects the rapid progress and prosperity of China's economic development, and reflects the vigorous development and prosperity of China's various undertakings. The so-called problem of surplus labor force has been solved, but new problems have also arisen, the main one being that while various departments are making rapid progress, it is necessary to greatly strengthen the first line of agricultural production. Guaranteeing a sufficient agricultural labor force, and at the same time guaranteeing that the development of various sectors of the national economy has the necessary and reasonable labor force, is the top factor for guaranteeing the development of agricultural production, and is also the top factor for guaranteeing the development of industry and other undertakings.

Now, the various production departments of industry and transportation above the county level have a considerable amount of labor force, which is enough to guarantee the needs of the continued leap forward of industrial production and construction. The task facing these departments is to seriously study, think of more ways, continue to promote the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, improve labor organization, strengthen labor management, and constantly improve labor productivity to a new level. The further development of production in these departments is by no means mainly dependent on the gradual increase of labor force as in the past, but can only be, and must be, dependent on the continuous improvement of labor productivity. The labor force required by new factories and mines should be adjusted and resolved from the existing employees, and should not arbitrarily recruit labor from rural areas. As for various non-productive departments and administrative agencies, it is even more necessary to improve efficiency, implement streamlining, reduce staffing, so as to extract as much labor as possible to support productive undertakings, especially agricultural production undertakings. This should be the case in cities, and it should also be the case in rural areas.

The most important thing in the rational arrangement of labor force in rural areas is to solve the arrangement of agriculture and non-agriculture. The production undertakings of the rural people's communes should focus on the development of agricultural production. The development of other undertakings, including commune-run industry, short-distance transportation, commercial credit, cultural, educational and health, and livelihood and welfare undertakings, should all be subordinate to and conducive to the cause of agricultural production and construction. The labor force required by these undertakings should be properly arranged on the premise of ensuring the sustained leap forward of agriculture. In agriculture, the arrangement of labor force should first of all guarantee the development of agricultural production, and then, according to the plan, carry out various basic productive constructions separately, in order of priority, and at the same time, not build or build less various non-productive constructions that are not urgently needed. In agricultural production, the arrangement of labor force should focus on guaranteeing the needs of increasing crop production, and at the same time appropriately take care of the needs of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In crop production, the arrangement of labor force should not only guarantee the needs of grain crops, but also guarantee the needs of industrial raw material crops. In short, rationally arranging the distribution proportion of rural labor force is an important task for the rural people's communes to lead agricultural production and construction in the future, and is an important part of arranging the short-term and long-term plans of the rural people's commune economy. The leading organs of the commune should seriously study the specific conditions of local agricultural production at that time, consult with the masses in case of trouble, do this arrangement work realistically, and resolutely avoid the phenomenon of waste of labor force.

Of course, with the gradual advancement of the technical transformation of agriculture and the gradual realization of agricultural modernization, the needs of various undertakings in rural areas for labor force will continue to change, and the distribution proportion of rural labor force in various aspects will also change. In the future, we should strengthen the support of industry for agriculture, accelerate the mechanization and semi-mechanization of agriculture, and carry out mass movements to improve agricultural tools and tools, so as to promote this change. And after this change occurs, we should promptly and appropriately transfer labor force from those areas where there is indeed a surplus of labor force to supplement those areas that really need to increase labor force. However, under the conditions that technical conditions have not been significantly improved, it is never possible to arbitrarily draw labor force from agricultural production.

The policy put forward by the Party Central Committee to rationally arrange the labor force in various economic sectors, so that the first line of agricultural production can maintain and be equipped with a sufficient labor force, is a matter of grasping economic laws. Marx said: "All savings, in the final analysis, are reduced to the saving of time. Everyone should rationally allocate his time in order to acquire the knowledge that should be possessed in all aspects or to meet the various requirements for his activities. Similarly, society should also properly allocate its time in order to achieve the production that is suitable for its entire requirements. Therefore, saving time and planning to allocate labor time in various production sectors has become the primary economic law based on collective production. This is even an extremely advanced law." ⑦ What Marx said about saving labor time is to improve labor productivity. To improve labor productivity is to rationally use and save labor force while continuously improving technology. In social production, the saving of labor force is the greatest saving, and the waste of labor force is the greatest waste. To avoid the waste of labor force and realize the saving of labor force is to plan to allocate labor time and plan to allocate labor force in various production sectors, as Marx said.

Rationally allocating labor force is a prominent issue in our national economic plan. Not only should there be a unified labor force allocation plan suitable for the actual situation in the whole country, but also various economic sectors, various regions, various units, and various communes should also make a labor force allocation plan for their own departments, regions, units, and communes realistically according to the provisions of the national unified plan. There must be a labor force allocation plan for the production plan, and there must be a labor force guarantee for the increase in production measures. The production plans and labor force allocation plans of enterprises, institutions, and communes should be fully discussed by the masses, jointly formulated, and jointly implemented. As far as the commune is concerned, the production team members and cadres should mainly decide the production plan and labor force allocation plan, and the commune leading organs should not decide it from top to bottom alone.

Properly handling the issues of labor force saving and rational allocation, as far as the rural areas are concerned, is inseparable from adhering to and consolidating the three-level ownership system of the commune based on the production team. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party on the People's Commune in December 1958 clearly pointed out: "The means of production and products of the rural people's communes are now basically still collectively owned by the commune, which is different from the state-owned enterprises' means of production and products being owned by the whole people." "The people's commune should implement a system of unified leadership and hierarchical management... The production team is the basic unit for organizing labor." The distribution system of the people's commune "is still socialist, to each according to his ability, to each according to his work." At the Second Zhengzhou Conference convened by the Party Central Committee in February 1959, the three-level ownership system of the rural people's commune was further clarified, pointing out that it is necessary to have a long-term development process from basic team ownership to basic commune ownership, and then to ownership by the whole people. Since that time, the people's commune has embarked on a more consolidated and sound development path after many rectifications. Practice has proved that the three-level ownership system of the commune based on the production team is the best fundamental system of the people's commune at the present stage, and is the fundamental system conducive to the development of agricultural production, which must be stabilized for a long period of time.

The agricultural issue is a very important issue, and is a fundamental issue related to the continued leap forward of China's socialist economy. As long as we do our work better from the two aspects of agricultural productivity and rural socialist relations of production, we will be able to give greater and better play to the superiority of the people's commune, and we will be able to set off a new upsurge of agricultural production and strive to produce more grain and achieve a bumper harvest in 1961. In this way, the entire national economy based on agriculture will surely achieve a better and greater leap forward, and the Party's general line of socialist construction will surely achieve a better and greater victory.

    工农业并举是我国社会主义经济的一个重要规律
    “红旗”杂志一九六○年第二十二期社论
    毛泽东同志在1959年党的八届八中全会上提出要把农业放在经济问题中的首要地位。这个意见对于我们的社会主义建设事业，非常重要。
    早在1934年1月，毛泽东同志在“我们的经济政策”的论文中说过，“农业生产是我们经济建设工作的第一位”。这是马克思主义者在经济问题上的一个根本论点。这个论点不但在革命根据地时期是完全正确的，而且在社会主义建设时期也是完全正确的。毛泽东同志一直坚持着这个论点。他在1945年党的第七次全国代表大会的报告中，进一步地、全面地阐明了农民在我国政治生活中的重要性，阐明了农业在整个国民经济中的重要性。他说：
      “农民——这是中国工人的前身。将来还要有几千万农民进入城市，进入工厂。如果中国需要建设强大的民族工业，建设很多的近代的大城市，就要有一个变农村人口为城市人口的长过程。
    农民——这是中国工业市场的主体。只有他们能够供给最丰富的粮食和原料，并吸收最大量的工业品。”
    全国解放以后，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，毛泽东同志指出农业生产的发展必须适应于社会主义工业化发展的需要，而要达到这个目的，第一步就是要实现农业合作化，第二步就是要接着农业合作化逐步地实现农业的技术改造。
    毛泽东同志在1956年4月“关于十大关系”的演说中，第一条说的就是必须正确处理农业和工业的关系。随后他又在
  “关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的论著中尖锐地提出了问题。他说：“我国有五亿多农业人口，农民的情况如何，对于我国经济的发展和政权的巩固，关系极大。”他总结了我国第一个五年计划的经验，考虑了社会主义兄弟国家的经验，认为在我们的社会主义经济事业中，“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举”，“重工业要以农业为重要市场”，等等。这是马克思主义者在经济问题上一个突出的创造性的新概括，是马克思主义者在社会主义建设问题上一个突出的创造性的新概括。毛泽东同志和党中央提出的一系列的“同时并举”的方针，都是从工农业同时并举这一个基本方针出发的，而我们的经验，特别是1958年以来社会主义建设总路线实行的经验，证明这些方针是完全正确的。
    在党的总路线指导下出现的大跃进和人民公社，这是我国社会主义建设时期的两件伟大的新事物。为了使我国国民经济能够继续保持跃进的速度，又能够继续保持按比例的发展，为了充分地发挥人民公社的优越性，在经济建设的日程上，要求我们把发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，在新条件下进一步地具体化。人民公社化的实现，给我国农业的发展开辟了更广阔的天地，农业对于机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化的要求，越来越迫切；另一方面，就工业本身说，也只有逐步实现农业上述一系列的要求，才能使农业给工业提供越来越多的劳动力，给工业提供越来越多的粮食和原料。正是根据这个道理，毛泽东同志强调地提出了要把农业放在首要地位的问题。
    把农业列在首要地位，这是促使我国国民经济继续跃进所必须采取的一个具有决定性的步骤。采取这个步骤，不但不会妨碍工业的发展，相反地，会大大促进工业的继续跃进。党中央认为，我国国民经济的发展，必须以农业为基础，以工业为主导，把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业结合起来。
    有些同志总是把优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业当成两件互不相容的事情。毛泽东同志老早就批判了这种错误的观点。他在“关于农业合作化问题”的论文中说：“我们对于工业和农业、社会主义的工业化和社会主义的农业改造这样两件事，决不可以分割起来和互相孤立起来去看，决不可以只强调一方面，减弱另一方面。苏联的经验，在这个问题上也给我们指出了方向，我们的有些同志却没有注意，他们老是孤立地互不联系地去看这些问题。”
    按照马克思主义者的观点，优先发展重工业和迅速发展农业，这两件事是互为条件、互相结合、互相促进的。马克思对于资本主义条件下工业和农业的关系问题，作了很多的论证。例如，他说：“本国农业或者外国农业的一定发展程度，是资本的发展基础。”①他又说：“社会用来生产小麦和牲畜等等所需要的时间愈少，用来进行其他的生产——物质和精神的生产的时间就愈多。”②“超越于劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会的基础，尤其是资本主义生产的基础。”③所谓“超越于劳动者个人需要的农业劳动生产率，是一切社会的基础”，当然不只是说阶级社会，不只是说资本主义社会，而且也包括社会主义社会，以至共产主义社会。
    但是，在资本主义社会，工业和农业之间有不可克服的矛盾。正如列宁所说的：“农业的发展落后于工业，这是一切资本主义国家所固有的现象，是国民经济各部门间的比例遭到破坏、发生危机和物价高涨的最深刻的原因之一。”④美国是资本主义农业最发达的国家，它的农业对工业的发展起了巨大的作用；但是从美国资本主义发展的整个历史来说，美国农业发展速度也是落后于工业的，农业和工业之间始终是存在着深刻的不可克服的矛盾的。
    恩格斯说过：“……只有使工业生产和农业生产发生密切的内部联系，并使交通工具随着由此产生的需要扩充起来——当然以废除资本主义生产方式为前提——才能使农村人口从他们数千年来几乎一成不变地栖息在里面的那种孤立和愚昧的状态中挣脱出来。”⑤毫无疑问，在社会主义公有制的基础上，完全能够克服资本主义社会所固有的工业和农业的矛盾，完全能够避免在资本主义社会中那种农业发展落后于工业的现象，完全能够有计划地使农业和工业同时并举，同时并进，完全能够使工业和农业都以任何资本主义国家所不能有的高速度向前发展；因而也就完全能够如恩格斯所说的，“使工业生产和农业生产发生密切的内部联系”。这是社会主义经济发展的一个重要规律。
    毛泽东同志所提出的“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举”的方针，正是周密地考虑了在社会主义制度下工业和农业之间的密切的内部联系的问题，正是正确地表述了、掌握了农业需要同工业密切地同时并进的这个社会主义经济发展的重要规律。毛泽东同志阐明了这个社会主义经济发展的重要规律，对于我国社会主义建设的前进，具有伟大的指导作用。实践将越来越证明这种作用。
    1959年党的八届八中全会以来，特别是今年以来，为了更好地贯彻执行工业和农业同时并举的方针，党和国家采取了一系列有力的措施，来进一步处理农业发展的两个关键问题：一个是关于农村生产关系的问题，主要是贯彻执行党的八届六中全会、郑州会议以来一系列的农村政策，继续坚持和巩固以生产队为基础的公社三级所有制。另一个是关于农业生产力的问题，主要是在积极推进农业技术改造的同时，在各个经济部门更合理地安排劳动力，使农业生产的第一线保持和配备足够的劳动力。实事求是地、进一步地处理这两个问题，就有可能在比较短的时间内改变目前农业发展落后于工业迅速发展的状况，并且将同时有利于工业和其他经济部门的继续跃进。
    我国国民经济的发展是大跃进和按比例的有计划的统一。目前我国经济技术水平还不算高，农业技术还很落后，在这样的情况下，我国国民经济有计划的按比例的发展，要特别注意劳动力在各经济部门的分配比例，特别注意农业生产部门所占劳动力的比例。合理地安排这种比例，是我们进一步地贯彻执行工业和农业同时并举方针的一个重要环节。
    马克思说：“能够投于工商业上面而无须从事农业的劳动者人数……是取决于农业劳动者在他们自身的消费额以外，能够生产多少的农产物。”⑥这就是说，从农业人口中能够抽调多少劳动力来从事工业、商业和其他事业，不是决定于这些事业对于劳动力的需要，而是决定于留在农业生产领域上的劳动者所生产的粮食和其他农产物，除了供应农业人口的需要以外，是否能够供应非农业人口的需要，以及能够供应多少。我们要积极推行农业的技术改造，逐步实现农业的机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化，逐步地提高农业劳动生产率，以便用比现在少得多的农业劳动力，来生产比现在多得多的农产物，从而由农业部门逐步地抽出劳动力，来从事工业、商业和其他事业。但是，在目前的条件下，我国的农业还不能立即全部地实现技术现代化，而只能首先在一些局部的地方逐步实现农业的机械化。经过过去三年的连续跃进，经过技术革新和技术革命运动的开展，我国劳动力的使用和分配，发生了极大的变化。旧中国遗留下来的劳动力过剩的问题，已经完全得到解决，而出现了劳动力不足的现象。这种情况，反映了我国经济发展的突飞猛进、繁荣昌盛，反映了我国各项事业的蒸蒸日上、欣欣向荣。所谓劳动力过剩的问题解决了，但是新的问题又产生了，主要的就是，在各个部门突飞猛进的同时，要大大地加强农业生产第一线。保证足够的农业劳动力，同时，也保证国民经济各部门的发展有必需的合理的劳动力，这是保证农业生产发展的头等要素，也是保证工业和其他各项事业发展的头等要素。
    现在县城以上的工业、交通各个生产部门中，劳动力已经有了相当大的数量，足以保证工业生产、建设继续跃进的需要。这些部门面临的任务，是认真钻研，多想办法，继续推进技术革新和技术革命运动，改进劳动组织，加强劳动管理，把劳动生产率不断地提高到新的水平。这些部门生产的进一步发展，决不是像过去那样主要依靠劳动力的陆续增加，而只能是、必须是依靠劳动生产率的不断提高。新建厂矿所需要的劳动力，应当由现有职工中调剂解决，而不应当任意向农村招收劳动力。至于各个非生产性部门，以及行政机构，更必须提高效率，实行精简，缩小编制，以便尽可能抽出劳动力支援生产事业，特别是农业生产事业。这一点，在城市应当是这样，在农村也应当是这样。
    农村中劳动力的合理安排，最重要的是解决农业和非农业两个方面的安排问题。农村人民公社的生产事业，要以发展农业生产为主。其他各项事业，包括社办工业、短途运输、商业信贷、文教卫生、生活福利事业的发展，都应当服从于、有利于农业生产建设事业。这些事业所需要的劳动力，都应当在保证农业持续跃进的前提下，妥善安排。在农业中，劳动力的安排应当首先要保证农业生产的发展，而后按照计划，分别先后缓急，进行各项基本的生产性建设，同时，不建或者少建各种不是急需的非生产性建设。在农业生产中，劳动力的安排应当着重保证农作物增产的需要，同时适当照顾林业、畜牧业、副业、渔业的需要。在农作物的生产中，劳动力的安排既要保证粮食作物的需要，又要保证工业原料作物的需要。总之，合理安排农村劳动力的分配比例，是农村人民公社今后领导农业生产建设的一项重要任务，是安排农村人民公社经济的短期和长期计划的一个重要内容。公社的领导机关应当认真研究当地当时农业生产的具体条件，遇事同群众商量，实事求是地做好这种安排工作，坚决避免浪费劳动力的现象。
    当然，随着农业技术改造的逐步推进，农业现代化的逐步实现，农村各项事业对劳动力的需要会不断发生变化，农村劳动力在各个方面的分配比例也会发生变化。我们今后要加强工业对农业的支援，加快农业的机械化、半机械化，开展群众性的改进农具和工具的运动，以促进这种变化。并且在这种变化发生以后，及时地适当地从那些确有多余劳动力的方面，抽调劳动力来补足另一些确实需要增加劳动力的方面。但是，在技术条件还没有显著改进的情况下，决不能够主观任意地从农业生产方面抽调劳动力。
    党中央提出的在各个经济部门合理地安排劳动力，使农业生产的第一线能够保持和配备足够的劳动力这个方针，是一个掌握经济规律的问题。马克思说：“一切节省，归根到底都归结为时间的节省。每个人应当合理地支配自己的时间，以便获得应当具备的各方面的知识或者满足对他的活动的各种要求，同样的，社会也应当适当地支配自己的时间，以便达到那种适应于它的整个要求的生产。因此，节省时间以及在各个生产部门中有计划地分配劳动时间，就成了以集体生产为基础的首要的经济规律。这甚至是极其高级的规律。”⑦马克思所说的节约劳动时间，就是要提高劳动生产率。而要提高劳动生产率，就是要在不断改进技术的同时，合理使用和节约使用劳动力。在社会生产中，劳动力的节约是最大的节约，劳动力的浪费是最大的浪费。我们要避免劳动力的浪费，实现劳动力的节约，就是要像马克思所说的那样，在各个生产部门中，有计划地分配劳动时间，有计划地分配劳动力。
    合理地分配劳动力，是我们国民经济计划中一个突出的问题。不仅在全国范围内，要有一个统一的适合于实际情况的劳动力的分配计划，而且各个经济部门、各个地区、各个单位、各个公社，也都应当根据国家统一计划的规定，实事求是地做出本部门、本地区、本单位、本公社的劳动力分配计划。有生产计划，就要有劳动力分配计划，有增产措施，就要有劳动力的保证。企业、事业单位的和公社的生产计划和劳动力分配计划，都应当经过群众的充分讨论，共同制定，共同执行。就公社来说，决定生产计划和劳动力分配计划的，主要的，应当是生产队的社员群众和干部，不能只是由生产队的干部决定，也不能只是由公社领导机关自上而下地决定。
    妥善地处理劳动力的节约和合理分配的问题，就农村来说，是同坚持和巩固以生产队为基础的公社三级所有制分不开的。1958年12月党的八届六中全会关于人民公社的决议中明确指出：“农村人民公社的生产资料和产品，现在基本上仍然属于公社集体所有，同国营企业的生产资料和产品属于全民所有不同。”“人民公社应当实行统一领导、分级管理的制度。……生产队是组织劳动的基本单位。”人民公社的分配制度，“仍然是社会主义的，各尽所能，按劳分配。”在1959年2月，党中央又召开的第二次郑州会议，进一步地明确确定了农村人民公社的三级所有制，指出由基本队有到基本社有，再到全民所有，必要有一个长期的发展过程。从那个时候以来，人民公社经过多次的整顿，已经走上了更加巩固和更加健全发展的道路。经验证明，以生产队为基础的公社三级所有制，是现阶段人民公社的最好的根本制度，是有利于发展农业生产的根本制度，必须在一个长时期内稳定下来。
    农业问题，是一个非常重要的问题，是关系我国社会主义经济保持继续跃进的根本性问题。只要我们从农业生产力和农村社会主义生产关系两个方面进一步地做好工作，我们就能够更大更好地发挥人民公社的优越性，就能够掀起一个农业生产的新高潮，力争1961年多打粮食，获得大丰收。这样，以农业为基础的整个国民经济必将取得更好更大的跃进，党的社会主义建设总路线必将取得更好更大的胜利。
