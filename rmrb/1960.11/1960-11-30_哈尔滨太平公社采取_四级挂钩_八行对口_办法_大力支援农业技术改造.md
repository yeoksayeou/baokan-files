Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Harbin's Taiping Urban People's Commune has adopted the methods of "four-level linking" and "eight-line counterpart" to vigorously support the agricultural technological transformation of rural people's communes, achieving very good results.

The "four-level linking" method of Taiping Urban Commune to support agriculture is that, under the unified leadership of the Commune Party Committee, large factories are organized to contractually assist counties in establishing and appropriately developing machine manufacturing industries; factory workshops contractually assist rural people's communes in establishing mechanical repair factories, so that the communes can manufacture general agricultural implements and overhaul tractors themselves; larger factory sections contractually assist management districts (i.e., production teams) in establishing farm tool repair stations, so that the management districts can medium-repair tractors and manufacture small farm tools such as sickles and hoe blades themselves; and factory groups contractually assist production squads in equipping themselves with tools such as hammers, pliers, and wrenches, and establishing mobile repair points, so as to achieve "parts in groups, tools in sets, right at the field, available whenever needed." In addition, Taiping Urban People's Commune also organizes the technical, planning, materials, tools, education, finance, health, and capital construction departments of various factories to be linked with the corresponding departments of counties and communes respectively, and implement counterpart support.

After Taiping Urban People's Commune adopted this "four-level linking" and "eight-line counterpart" method, various factories, on the premise of completing the state plan, have ensured that the support to rural people's communes is planned at each level and has specific goals in each line. Harbin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory and the factory's various workshops, sections, groups, and relevant departments have conducted three or four investigation visits to the linked counties and rural people's communes, comprehensively understood the needs of the countryside, and generally formulated half-year or one-year support plans. Each department, workshop, section, and group has specific tasks to support agriculture, and 90% of the factory's employees participate in supporting agricultural activities. When the director and workers of the large parts machining workshop visited the Minhe Commune, the rural commune cadres told them that they were still short of bullhead planers and presses. After the workers returned to the factory, they racked their brains to find solutions, using old parts to assemble a grinder, converting an old fitter's workbench into a universal workbench, and picking up materials from the scrap pile to make a vise, and repairing and scraping a waste platform to make it a new platform. A few days later, the Minhe Commune not only had planers and presses, but also had platforms, vises, grinders, and universal workbenches. The commune members said: "Although it is an exchange of equal value, the worker comrades are really thoughtful and do a thorough job for us."

The technical department of Harbin No. 1 Machine Tool Factory helped the factories in Bin County master the technical design data of lathes, planers, drilling machines, threshing machines, etc., and also helped the county establish a technical library and a laboratory, and surveyed and mapped a complete set of parts and component drawings of existing agricultural machinery, so that they could manufacture parts themselves. The mechanical processing workshop of this factory sent functional personnel to the Binxigong Commune Machinery Factory in Bin County to help them formulate a set of management personnel responsibility systems and management systems for planning, scheduling, inspection, materials, tools, and technical safety, so that the production of rural commune factories is more planned, and the equipment utilization rate, product qualification rate, and labor productivity have been greatly improved.

    哈尔滨太平公社采取“四级挂钩”“八行对口”办法
    大力支援农业技术改造
    据新华社讯　哈尔滨市太平城市人民公社，采取“四级挂钩”、“八行对口”的办法，大力支援农村人民公社的农业技术改造，取得了很好的效果。
    太平城市公社支援农业的“四级挂钩”方法，就是在公社党委统一领导下，组织大工厂包干帮助县建立与适当地发展机器制造工业；工厂的车间包干帮助农村人民公社建立机械修配厂，使公社能自己制造一般农具和大修拖拉机；工厂的较大工段包干帮助管理区（即生产队）建立农具修配站，使管理区能自己中修拖拉机和制造镰刀、锄板等小农具；工厂小组包干帮助生产小队配齐锤、钳、搬等工具，建立流动修配点，做到“零件成组，工具成套，地头地脑，随用随到”。此外，太平城市人民公社还组织各工厂的技术、计划、材料、工具、教育、财务、卫生、基本建设等八个方面，分别与县、社的相应部门挂钩，实行对口支援。
    太平城市人民公社采取这种“四级挂钩”、“八行对口”的方法后，各工厂在完成国家计划的前提下，对农村人民公社的支援作到了级级有规划，行行有具体目标。哈尔滨第一机器制造厂和工厂的各车间、工段、小组以及有关科室，普遍到挂钩的县和农村人民公社里去进行了三、四次调查访问，全面了解了农村需要，并普遍制订了半年或一年的支援规划。每个科室、车间、工段和小组，都有支援农业的具体任务，全厂90％的职工参加支援农业活动。大件加工车间的车间主任和工人们到民和公社访问的时候，农村公社干部告诉他们还缺牛头刨床和压力机，职工们回厂后，大家分头想办法，用旧零件凑成了砂轮机，把旧钳工案改成了万能工作台，从废品堆里拣材料造出了老虎钳子，把废平台修理刮平改成了新平台。几天后，民和公社不仅有了刨床、压力机，而且有了平台、虎钳、砂轮机、万能工作台等。社员们说：“尽管是等价交换，可是工人老大哥给咱们想的真周到，做的也真周到。”
    哈尔滨第一机器制造厂的技术部门，帮助宾县的工厂掌握了车床、刨床、钻床、脱谷机等项技术设计资料，还帮助这个县建立了技术图书室和化验站，并测绘了现有农业机器的全套零件、部件图纸，使他们能自己制造零件。这个工厂的机械加工车间派出职能人员到宾县宾西公社机械厂，帮助他们制订了一套管理人员职责制度和计划、调度、检验、材料、工具、技术安全等管理制度，使农村公社工厂的生产更有计划，设备利用率、产品合格率、劳动生产率都有很大提高。
