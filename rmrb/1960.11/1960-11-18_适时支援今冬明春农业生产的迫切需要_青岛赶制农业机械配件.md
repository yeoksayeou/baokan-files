To meet the urgent needs of agricultural production this winter and next spring, the workers of Qingdao's industrial sector are vigorously rushing to produce agricultural machinery parts, according to a report in the Qingdao Daily. Statistics from September and October show that 21,520 parts for internal combustion engines, tractors, and tractor-drawn farm implements have been completed, along with more than 24.65 million parts for wheelbarrows and ground carts. These parts have been successively transferred to the countryside by commercial departments.

Factories and enterprises undertaking the task of producing parts, in order to resolutely guarantee the comprehensive completion of parts production tasks on time, with quality, in quantity, and according to variety and specifications, are grasping parts production as an important task in accordance with the principle of "equal emphasis on manufacturing and repair, equal emphasis on main engines and parts," and mobilizing workers to vigorously launch shock production. The Internal Combustion Engine Factory has made rapid progress in production due to the leadership's emphasis and the earnest mobilization of workers. This factory is responsible for producing 600 sets of 3.5 horsepower gasoline engine parts from September to December, and completed 550 sets in September and October alone. More than half of the 560 sets of 12 horsepower diesel engine parts and 11,540 sets of 40 horsepower diesel engine parts that they are responsible for have also been completed. The Vehicle Factory has now completed 21.3 million steel balls for wheelbarrows, 29,250 bundles of spokes, 140,000 wheel shafts, and 160,000 wheel bowls, among which wheel shafts and wheel bowls have completed the assigned tasks. The No. 1 Machinery Factory of the Handicraft Industry Bureau has nearly completed the task of forging 200,000 wheelbarrow bowls. In order to produce more parts, they have proactively proposed to forge another 140,000 wheel bowl blanks before the end of November. Other factories undertaking parts production tasks are also in the process of vigorously launching mass production.

In the shock production of parts, relevant commercial departments actively and proactively went to the factories to help solve key problems in production and urgently needed miscellaneous tools, which strongly guaranteed the progress of parts production.

    适时支援今冬明春农业生产的迫切需要
    青岛赶制农业机械配件
    本报讯　据青岛日报消息：为了支援今冬明春农业生产，青岛市工业部门职工正在大力突击农业机械配件生产。据9、10两个月的统计，已完成内燃机、拖拉机、机引农具等配件二万一千五百二十件，手推车和地排车配件二千四百六十五万多件，这些配件已由商业部门陆续调往农村。
    担负配件生产任务的各工厂企业，为了坚决保证按时、按质、按量、按品种规格地全面完成配件生产任务，根据“制造与修配并重，主机与配件并重”的方针，把配件生产当成一项重要的任务来抓，并发动职工大力突击。内燃机厂由于领导思想重视，认真地发动了职工，因而生产进度很快。这个厂9至12月份担负三匹半马力汽油机配件六百件的生产任务，仅9、10两个月就完成了五百五十件；担负的五百六十件十二马力柴油机配件和一万一千五百四十件四十马力柴油机配件，也都完成了一半以上。车辆厂现已完成手推车钢珠二千一百三十万粒、辐条二万九千二百五十包、车档十四万个和车碗十六万个，其中车档和车碗都已完成分配的任务。手工业管理局第一机械厂担负的二十万个手推车碗锻打任务已接近完成，为了更多地生产一些配件，他们又主动提出在11月底以前再锻打十四万个车碗毛坯。其它担负配件生产任务的各厂，也都在成批突击生产中。
    在突击配件生产中，有关商业部门积极主动地深入到各厂帮助解决生产中的关键问题，和生产上急需的零星工具，有力地保证了配件生产的进度。
