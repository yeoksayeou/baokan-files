Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 5th. The Cuban revolutionary government arrested the counter-revolutionary element and former General Secretary of the Confederation of Workers of Cuba, David Salvador, on the evening of the 4th.

According to an announcement issued by the News Bureau of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces on the 5th, former General Secretary of the Confederation of Workers of Cuba, David Salvador, was secretly engaged in rebellious activities, colluding with counter-revolutionary elements, serving imperialism, and shamelessly betraying the cause of the working class. The revolutionary government has ordered a search for and arrest him.

The announcement said that after a rapid search last night, military personnel discovered and arrested Salvador. At the time, he was meeting with a number of counter-revolutionary elements, attempting to escape to Miami, USA, from Jaimanitas Beach on a Caribbean yacht in order to join the counter-revolutionary mercenaries instigated there by the U.S. government. When Salvador was arrested, $13,500 was found on his person.

The announcement stated that the revolutionary government is determined to take action with all its strength against the enemies of the motherland – the traitors. The revolutionary government will publish the counter-revolutionary crimes of David Salvador and others arrested by the revolutionary courts.

According to "Free Press," David Salvador had already joined the "November 30th" counter-revolutionary organization funded by U.S. imperialism. He has consistently been a divisionist and anti-communist in the workers' movement.

    新华社哈瓦那5日电　古巴革命政府4日晚间逮捕了反革命分子、前古巴工人联合会总书记戴维·萨尔瓦多。
    据古巴革命武装部新闻局5日发表的公告说，前古巴工人联合会总书记戴维·萨尔瓦多由于秘密地从事叛乱活动，勾结反革命分子，为帝国主义效劳，无耻地背叛了工人阶级的事业，革命政府已经下令搜寻和对他进行逮捕。
    公告说，在昨晚进行急速的搜寻后，军队人员发现并逮捕了萨尔瓦多。当时他正和一些反革命分子在一起开会，企图从海马尼塔斯海滩乘加勒比游艇逃往美国的迈阿密，以便同美国政府在那里嗾使的反革命雇佣军会合。在逮捕萨尔瓦多的时候，从他身上搜到一万三千五百美元。
    公告说，革命政府决心以全力对祖国的敌人——叛变分子采取行动。革命政府将公布戴维·萨尔瓦多及其他被革命法庭逮捕的人的反革命罪行。
    据“自由新闻报”报道，戴维·萨尔瓦多已经加入了美帝国主义资助的“十一月三十日”反革命组织。他在工人运动中一贯是分裂主义者和反共分子。
