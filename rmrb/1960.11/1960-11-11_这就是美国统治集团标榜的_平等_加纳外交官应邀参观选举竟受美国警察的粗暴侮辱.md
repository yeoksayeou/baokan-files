Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th. News: A Ghanaian diplomat stationed in the United States was insulted by American police on the 8th while observing the American presidential election voting.

At the invitation of the American authorities to foreign diplomats stationed in the United States to observe the American election, Sikye, the Second Secretary of the Ghanaian Embassy in the United States, went to a polling station near Atlanta, Georgia, in the southern United States on the 8th to observe. However, he and another Ghanaian were forcibly driven out by two American policemen.

In a statement on the 9th, Sikye said that when the police came to drive them away, he pointed out that he was a guest of the United States and that the police's behavior "would cause trouble." But one of the policemen, who looked like a deputy officer, roared at Sikye, "There will be no trouble."

Sikye said that he was then forcibly driven out. He demanded an explanation as to why violence was being used against him, and an official from the police department actually said that it was because Sikye did not leave quickly enough.

    这就是美国统治集团标榜的“平等”
    加纳外交官应邀参观选举竟受美国警察的粗暴侮辱
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：加纳驻美国的一个外交官8日在参观美国总统选举投票时受到美国警察的侮辱。
    应美国当局请外国驻美外交人员参观美国大选的邀请，加纳驻美国大使馆二等秘书西克耶8日到美国南部乔治亚州亚特兰大附近的一个投票站去参观。但是他和另一个加纳人被两个美国警察用暴力赶了出来。
    西克耶9日发表谈话说，当警察来赶他们时，他曾指出他是美国的客人，警察的行为“会引起麻烦”。但是其中一个像是副警官的人却对西克耶咆哮说，“不会有麻烦”。
    西克耶说，他于是被用暴力赶了出来。他要求解释为什么要对他施用暴力，警察局的一个官员居然说，这是因为西克耶离开得不够快。
