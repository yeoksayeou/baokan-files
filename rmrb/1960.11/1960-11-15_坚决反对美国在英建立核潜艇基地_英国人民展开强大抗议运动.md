Xinhua News Agency, London, 14th. The British people's movement against the U.S. establishing a "Polaris" missile submarine base in Scotland continues to develop. Over a hundred residents of the village of Sandbank, Holy Loch, strongly protested against the U.S.'s preparation to establish a submarine base there, signing a petition and sending it to British Prime Minister Macmillan.

Marches against the establishment of such a base were held in Liverpool, Sheffield, and Manchester last weekend. The Eccles branch of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Liverpool branch of the Transport and General Workers' Union demanded the abandonment of plans to establish such a base in Britain.

It is reported that representatives of 20,000 miners in Fife and Clackmannan unanimously condemned the plan to establish such a base in Britain and decided to launch a petition movement in the coal mining areas.

The Glasgow Trades Council is preparing a large-scale demonstration. The other ten trades councils in Scotland have also announced their opposition to the U.S. base.

Clydeside plumbers have demanded that their national union executive committee declare a refusal to accept any work related to the establishment of this base.

The Halifax Trades Council condemned the U.S. establishment of this base as aggravating the "Cold War" situation.

The British Communist Party recently printed a striking two-color leaflet entitled "Keep Out!", calling for action against the establishment of a U.S. "Polaris" missile submarine base. More than 330,000 copies of this leaflet have been sent to local party organizations for distribution.
