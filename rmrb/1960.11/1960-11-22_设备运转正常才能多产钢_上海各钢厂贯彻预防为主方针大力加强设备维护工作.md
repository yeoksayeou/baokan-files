Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric - Guided by the idea that "time is steel, and only normal equipment operation yields steel," Shanghai's steel plant workers actively implement a prevention-first policy. They vigorously strengthen equipment maintenance, continuously improve the quality of equipment repairs, and improve the management system of repair equipment, ensuring the normal and safe operation of various equipment from multiple perspectives, promoting the continuous and substantial increase in steel production, and guaranteeing the completion of this year's production plan.

Since September, Shanghai's steel plants have regarded this work as an important measure to achieve sustained growth in steel production and complete the annual plan, mobilizing the masses to study methods for improving equipment maintenance and repair work. After criticizing the idea that "mechanical equipment is running all day long, and there is no way to prevent problems in advance" in discussions, the workers of the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant launched an activity where everyone acted as a "pre-event Zhuge Liang," and summarized a set of experiences for inspecting equipment: listen carefully (to the running sound), look closely (at whether the shape is normal), ask more questions (about the operating conditions), touch frequently (to check the temperature), and add oil frequently. After this workshop comprehensively promoted this set of experiences, it quickly eliminated equipment accidents, and steel production increased significantly, producing nearly 1,000 tons more steel than planned in two months.

In order to better strengthen equipment maintenance and repair work, some steel plants have also formulated many new management systems. The Party Branch of the No. 2 Open Hearth Furnace Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, the workshop repair workers, and the workers of each work section closely cooperated to divide the large and small equipment in the workshop into three systems: one is the "Iron Dragon Production Equipment System" centered on the pig iron furnace and composed of hot blast furnaces, material yards, and other types of work; one is the "Steel Dragon Production Equipment System" centered on the converter and composed of steel pouring and other types of work; and the other is a system mainly composed of overhead cranes operating at high altitude, plus blowers. In addition to repairing equipment that malfunctions at any time, special personnel are responsible for inspecting these three systems and arranging the time and items for regular maintenance. The maintenance workers also frequently learn about the operation of the equipment from the workers who use it, and formulate maintenance plans by category. Before maintenance, they prepare in advance for each maintenance item and the parts that need to be replaced, greatly improving the speed and quality of maintenance.

While strengthening equipment maintenance and repair work, various factories are also carrying out technical innovations, which not only make the equipment operate normally, but also make it more efficient.

### 设备运转正常才能多产钢  上海各钢厂贯彻预防为主方针大力加强设备维护工作

    设备运转正常才能多产钢
    上海各钢厂贯彻预防为主方针大力加强设备维护工作
    据新华社上海电　上海各钢铁厂职工在“时间就是钢、设备正常运转才有钢”的思想指导下积极贯彻执行预防为主的方针。他们大力加强设备的维护工作，不断提高设备的检修质量，改进检修设备的管理制度，从多方面来保证各种设备的正常安全运转，促使钢产量不断大幅度上升，保证完成今年的生产计划。
    上海各钢铁厂从9月份以来，都把这项工作作为实现钢产量持续增长、完成全年计划的一项重要措施，发动群众研究提高设备维护和检修工作的方法。上钢一厂第一转炉车间工人们在讨论中，批判了部分人认为“机械设备一天到晚在运转，有毛病也无法事先防治”的思想以后，开展了一个人人都当“事前诸葛亮”的活动，并且总结了一套检查设备的经验：静听（运转声音）细看（外形是否正常）多问（操作情况）、勤摸（温度高低）、勤加油。这个车间全面推广了这套经验以后，很快地从基本上消灭了设备事故，钢产量连续大幅度上升，两个月内比计划多生产了近一千吨钢。
    为了更好地加强设备维护检修工作，有些钢厂还制定了许多新的管理制度。上钢三厂第二转炉车间的党总支、车间检修工人和各工段工人密切合作，把车间里的大小设备分成三个系统：一个是以化铁炉为中心，同热风炉、料场等工种组成的“铁龙生产设备系统”：一个是以转炉为中心，同浇钢等工种组成的“钢龙生产设备系统”；一个是以高空起重运行的行车为主，加上鼓风机成为一个系统。对这三个系统的设备，除了平时发生故障，随叫随修以外，还有专人负责检查和安排定期检修的时间、项目。检修的工人还经常从使用设备的工人那里，随时了解设备的运转情况，分门别类地订出检修计划。检修以前，对每个检修项目和需要调换的部件，都事先作好准备，大大提高检修进度和质量。
    各厂在加强设备维护检修工作中，还同时开展技术革新，不仅使设备运转得正常，而且效率更高。
