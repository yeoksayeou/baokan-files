Smelting Steel for the Commune Members
Shenyang Zhongjie Friendship Factory Worker Ren Xing

Steelmaking workers busy smelting steel, steel drills dance, steel flowers fly, faces dripping with sweat that can't be wiped away, day and night skillfully seizing steel. Thousands of tons of steel, tens of thousands of tons of steel, lathes, milling machines, planers, machines installed, thousands and tens of thousands sent to the countryside, in autumn laughing and gazing at the granary.

    为社员炼钢
    沈阳中捷友谊厂工人  张振声炼钢工人炼钢忙，钢钎飞舞钢花扬，满脸汗水揩不尽，日日夜夜巧夺钢。千吨钢、万吨钢，车、铣、钳、刨机器装，千台万台送农村，秋后笑望米粮仓。（附图片）
