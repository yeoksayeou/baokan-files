    Party Newspapers Should Be Promoted Among Peasants; The Phenomenon of Many Townships in Fengcheng County, Jiangxi, Not Subscribing to Newspapers Should Be Corrected

    To the Editor: Party newspapers are the collective propagandists, agitators, and organizers of the masses, and it is essential that they are seen by the broad masses of workers and peasants every day. However, leading cadres in some districts and townships of Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, completely disregard this work.

    In January and February of this year, our land reform visiting group of teachers and students from Nanchang Normal School visited the thirteenth district of Fengcheng County to observe land reform and discovered that places such as Caoxi Township, Shangze Township, Gutang Township, and Shaofang Township in this district had not subscribed to a single newspaper. Therefore, local peasants fundamentally did not know what was going on with the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, which have already been launched with great fanfare in major cities across the country. Shili Township, only seven li away from Nanchang City, has not subscribed to a single newspaper. District and township cadres used "streamlining and saving" and "lack of office expenses" as excuses for not subscribing to newspapers. As a result, the political and current affairs learning of peasants in this area is very poor. This prevents the policies and decrees of the Party and the People's Government from being disseminated in a timely, widespread, and in-depth manner among the broad masses of peasants, and also makes it impossible to exchange advanced production and work experiences from various places. This is detrimental to the improvement of the political consciousness of peasants and the production and construction of rural areas. The propaganda and education departments of the local Party and government should recognize the role of Party newspapers in propaganda and education among the masses, and postal distribution personnel should actively promote the people's newspapers to the broad masses of peasants.

    应把党报推广到农民中去
    江西丰城县许多乡不订报纸的现象应予纠正
    编辑同志：党报是群众的集体宣传者、鼓动者和组织者，必须使它天天和广大的工农群众见面。但江西省丰城县有些区乡政府的领导干部，却根本漠视这一工作。
    今年一、二月间，我们南昌市师范学校师生土地改革参观团到丰城县十三区参观土地改革，发现这个区的草溪乡、上泽乡、古塘乡、邵坊乡等地连一份报纸也没有订。因此，当地农民对现在全国各大城市已经搞得轰轰烈烈的“三反”和“五反”运动，根本不知道是怎么一回事。距离南昌市只七里路的十里乡，连一份报纸都没有订。区乡干部藉口“精简节约”和“没有办公费”而不订报。因此，这一带地方农民的政治时事学习很差。这样就使党和人民政府的政策、法令不能及时、普遍、深入地在广大农民中传播，对各地先进的生产经验和工作经验也无从交流。这对农民政治觉悟的提高和农村的生产建设是不利的。当地党和政府的宣传教育部门应认识党报在群众中的宣传教育作用，邮局发行工作人员，应该积极地把人民的报纸推行到广大农民群众中去。    读者  江仁生
