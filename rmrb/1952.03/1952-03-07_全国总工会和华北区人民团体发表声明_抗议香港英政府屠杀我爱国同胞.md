Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement strongly protesting the British imperialists' crime of illegally massacring our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The statement is as follows:
Following the illegal arrest and deportation of our film artists and Kowloon disaster relief representatives Sima Wensen and Li Wenxing in January of this year, the British Hong Kong government, on March 1st, when more than 10,000 compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon went to the train station to welcome the "Delegation of People's Organizations from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City to Comfort Disaster-stricken Compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City," created a larger-scale bloody massacre of our compatriots. The British Hong Kong authorities first used police patrol cars to ram into the crowd, then threw tear gas at the crowd, and then directed a large number of British armed military police to open fire on the crowd. Many people were injured on the spot, including one seriously injured and three shot and wounded. Finally, the British police also mobilized hundreds of "riot squads," riding in armored vehicles to attack the crowd, and arrested more than a hundred of our patriotic compatriots.
We will never tolerate this planned and organized barbaric crime of the British imperialists in massacring our residents in Hong Kong and large-scale arresting and persecuting our patriotic compatriots! Our entire working class will resolutely oppose this provocative act by the British Hong Kong government to the end. The British Hong Kong government should recognize that the era of foreign imperialists bullying the Chinese people has been forever declared over with the founding of the People's Republic of China. If you still cling to your errors and act arbitrarily, you will be fully responsible for the serious consequences!
        All-China Federation of Trade Unions, March 6th
Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: The North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the North China Working Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the North China Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association, and the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and other people's organizations issued statements respectively, lodging serious protests against the British Hong Kong government's bloody massacre of our patriotic compatriots and its plot to arrest our patriotic compatriots on a large scale.
The statement of the North China Working Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions pointed out: This planned and organized provocative act by the British Hong Kong government is faithfully implementing the US imperialist policy of aggression against China, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. We will resolutely support this just struggle of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong until victory.
The statement of the North China Working Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League said: Since January of this year, the series of illegal acts by the British Hong Kong authorities have aroused great indignation and solemn protests from our people, but British imperialism has not only failed to stop its atrocities but has intensified them. The statement then called on members of the Youth League and the broad masses of patriotic youth in North China to actively rise up and support the struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong against imperialism with actions.
The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the North China Branch of the Resist America, Aid Korea General Association warned in their statements against the unreasonable atrocities of the British Hong Kong government, saying: If you dare to unscrupulously persecute our people in Hong Kong, you will be fully responsible for all serious consequences.

    全国总工会和华北区人民团体发表声明
    抗议香港英政府屠杀我爱国同胞
    【新华社六日讯】中华全国总工会发表声明，坚决抗议英帝国主义在香港非法屠杀我国爱国同胞的罪行，声明如下：
    香港英国政府继今年一月间非法逮捕和驱逐我国电影艺术工作者及九龙灾民代表司马文森、李文兴等之后，本月一日乘我香港九龙各界同胞万余人前往车站准备欢迎我国“广东省、广州市各界人民团体慰问九龙城东头村受灾同胞代表团”之际，又制造了更大规模的屠杀我国同胞的血腥暴行。香港英国当局始则用警察巡逻车向群众冲击，继则以催泪弹向群众投掷；再则指挥大批英国武装军警，向群众开枪射击。当场受伤人数甚多，其中一人被击重伤，三人中枪弹受伤；最后英国警署更调集了“突击冲锋队”数百人，分乘装甲车向群众冲袭，并逮捕了我爱国同胞百余人。
    英帝国主义这种有计划、有布置地屠杀我国在港居民、大规模地逮捕和迫害我国爱国同胞的野蛮罪行，我们决不能容忍！我们全国工人阶级对于香港英国政府这种挑衅行为，将坚决反对到底。香港英国政府应当认识，外国帝国主义者欺负中国人民的时代已由中华人民共和国的成立而永远宣告结束了。假如你们仍然执迷不悟，一意孤行，其所造成的严重后果将由你们完全负责！
        中华全国总工会三月六日
    【新华社六日讯】中华全国总工会华北工作委员会、中国新民主主义青年团华北工作委员会、华北抗美援朝总分会及华北文学艺术界联合会筹备委员会等人民团体分别发表声明，对香港英国政府血腥屠杀我爱国同胞的暴行、阴谋大规模逮捕我爱国同胞事件提出严重的抗议。
    中华全国总工会华北工作委员会的声明指出：香港英国政府这种有计划、有布置的挑衅行为正是在忠实地执行着美帝国主义的侵华政策，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。我们决以全力支持香港爱国同胞的这一正义斗争，直至胜利为止。
    中国新民主主义青年团华北工作委员会的声明说：自今年一月间以来，香港英国当局一连串的非法行为，已引起我国人民的极大愤慨和严正的抗议，但英帝国主义不但不因而停止其暴行，反变本加厉。声明继号召华北区的青年团员和广大爱国青年积极起来，用行动支援香港爱国同胞这一反对帝国主义的斗争。
    华北文学艺术界联合会筹备委员会及华北抗美援朝总分会在声明中警告香港英国政府的无理暴行说：如果你们胆敢肆无忌惮地迫害在香港的我国人民，一切严重后果，将由你们负全责。
