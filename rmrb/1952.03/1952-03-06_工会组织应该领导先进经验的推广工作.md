    Trade Union Organizations Should Lead the Promotion of Advanced Experiences

    The multi-tool, multi-edge cutting method initially appeared as a "trick" on a lathe in the Shenyang No. 6 Machine Tool Factory. After the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the China Machine Manufacturing Trade Union organized research and vigorously promoted it, it gradually became enriched, becoming an advanced working method applicable to all machine industries, and gradually forming a mass-based technical innovation movement.

    The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Machine Manufacturing Trade Union closely relied on advanced workers, using facts to educate workers with conservative ideas. Some workers doubted the superiority of the multi-tool, multi-edge method, saying, "It's only good for rough work; it can't handle precision work!" The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Machine Manufacturing Trade Union mobilized other workers to demonstrate and dispel their concerns. Then some workers said, "It won't work on steel!" The Municipal Committee then led the workers to solve this problem. One by one, the concerns were eliminated, and the workers turned to consciously learning this advanced experience. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Machine Manufacturing Trade Union, with a resolute attitude, closely relied on advanced workers, led backward workers, and continuously improved the ideological awareness of the workers, finally successfully promoting the advanced multi-tool, multi-edge working method among the broad masses of machine workers. This experience of organizing and leading the promotion of advanced working methods is worth the attention of trade union cadres in various regions.

    工会组织应该领导先进经验的推广工作
    多刀多刃切削法最初只是出现在沈阳机械六厂一个车床上的“窍门”。经过了中国机器制造业工会沈阳市委员会组织研究和大力推广以后，它才逐渐丰富起来，成为一个能适用于所有机器工业的先进工作法，并逐渐形成一个群众性的技术革新运动。
    机器制造业工会沈阳市委员会紧紧依靠先进的工人，以事实教育有保守思想的工人。有的工人怀疑多刀多刃工作法的优越性，说：“只配干这路粗活，干精密活可不行！”机器制造业工会沈阳市委员会动员别的工人做出样子来，打破了他们的顾虑。又有工人说：“干钢活可不行！”市委员会又领导工人把这个问题解决了。一个个的顾虑都消除了，工人转而自觉地学习这个先进经验。机器制造业工会沈阳市委员会以坚决的态度，紧紧依靠先进工人，带动落后工人，不断地提高工人的思想觉悟，终于在广大的机械工人中顺利地推广了多刀多刃的先进工作法。这种组织领导推广先进工作法的经验，值得各地工会干部重视。
