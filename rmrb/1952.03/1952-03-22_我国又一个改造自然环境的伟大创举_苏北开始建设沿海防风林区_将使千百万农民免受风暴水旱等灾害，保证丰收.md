Xinhua News Agency, Yangzhou, March 21st: The work of constructing a coastal shelterbelt area, extending over 1,000 *li* along the coast of northern Jiangsu, has begun. This is another great creation of our country in transforming the natural environment, following the implementation of the plan to build protective forest belts in the western part of Northeast China.

The northern Jiangsu shelterbelt area includes the main forest belt parallel to the Yellow Sea seawall, the auxiliary forest belts inside and outside the main forest belt, and the extensive shelterbelt networks between the main and auxiliary forest belts. The main forest belt is located inside the seawall, forming a sloping forest to resist sea winds. The auxiliary forest belts are located on the banks of tidal dikes, highways, and rivers parallel to the main forest belt. The shelterbelt networks are mainly distributed on the banks of ditches and embankments in many coastal reclamation areas. This shelterbelt area extends northward from the mouth of the Yangtze River, passing through the Sheyang River, the New Huai River, the Abandoned Yellow River, and the New Yi River, connecting with the Yuntai Mountain forest area, covering a total area of more than 60,000 square *li*, nearly one-third of the entire northern Jiangsu Plain.

Once the northern Jiangsu shelterbelt area is successfully constructed, it will save millions of coastal farmers from the suffering of marine storms, floods, droughts, and other disasters. It will also reduce the salt content in the air, transform alkaline soil, enable crops to grow well, and ensure bumper harvests. In the past, marine storms alone (especially the strong typhoons blowing from the Pacific Ocean during the peak growing season of various crops in July and August each year) caused an average annual reduction of 30% in crop yields in the coastal areas of northern Jiangsu, with the highest reduction reaching 80%; moreover, the lives and property of farmers were often greatly damaged. After the shelterbelt area is established, each forest belt will reduce wind speed by 35% to 40%, and the impact of storms on crops will be greatly weakened.

In order to build this forest area, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the East China Military and Political Committee and the Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office have dispatched a large number of agricultural and forestry experts and cadres for surveying, designing, and other preparatory work for more than two years. This year, northern Jiangsu has officially started cultivating seedlings, and it is expected that the entire afforestation plan will be completed in 1958. At present, the northern Jiangsu region has prepared 440,000 *jin* of more than ten kinds of seedlings suitable for growing on the coast, such as *Qiliu*, Honey Locust, Black Locust, Chinese Tallow Tree, Ginkgo, Mulberry, and Cypress, and has cultivated more than 800 *mu* of seedlings in places such as the Dongxin State-owned Farm in Guanyun County, and has mobilized coastal farmers to cultivate 5,000 *mu* of seedlings. Other work such as land reclamation, fertilization, and seed collection will also be widely carried out by mobilizing farmers.

    我国又一个改造自然环境的伟大创举
    苏北开始建设沿海防风林区
    将使千百万农民免受风暴水旱等灾害，保证丰收
    【新华社扬州二十一日电】建设苏北沿海长达一千多华里的防风林区的工作已经开始。这是我国在实施建设东北区西部防护林带计划之后的，又一个改造自然环境的伟大创举。
    苏北防风林区，包括和黄海海堤平行的主林带，在主林带内外的附林带，以及在主林带和附林带间的广大防风林网。主林带在海堤以内，成为抵御海风的斜面林。附林带在和主林带平行的潮堤、公路、河流两岸。防风林网主要分布在沿海垦区的许多沟洫堤岸上面。这个防风林区自长江口北延，经射阳河、新淮河、废黄河、新沂河，跟云台山林区相接，总面积达六万多平方华里，几占整个苏北平原的三分之一。
    苏北防风林区建设成功后，将使沿海千百万农民免受海洋风暴、水、旱等灾害的痛苦，而且还可以减少空气中的盐分，改造碱质土壤，使农作物得到良好的生长，保证丰收。过去单是海洋风暴（尤其是每年七、八月间各种农作物生长的旺季，从太平洋面吹来强烈的台风）的袭击，平均每年要使苏北沿海农田减产达百分之三十，最多的一年竟减产百分之八十；而且，农民的生命财产也常常受到很大损失。防风林区造成后，风暴每经一林带，将减低风速百分之三十五到四十，风暴对农作物的影响也就被大大削弱了。
    为建设这一林区，两年多以来华东军政委员会农林部和苏北人民行政公署派遣了大批农林专家和干部，从事勘察、设计等准备工作。今年苏北已正式开始培育树苗，预计一九五八年可完成全部造林计划。目前，苏北区已准备好了适宜海滨生长的杞柳、皂角、洋槐、乌桕、银杏、桑、柏等十余种树苗四十四万斤，由灌云县国营东辛农场等处育苗八百多亩，另外发动沿海农民育苗五千亩。其他垦地、施肥、采集树种等工作也将发动农民广泛进行。
