    Criticizing Bourgeois Ideology, Eliminating the Influence of American Imperialist Cultural Aggression
    The Ideological Struggle at Yenching University Enters a Climax
    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement at Yenching University has reached a climax. The movement began in late January with the mobilization of all faculty, staff, and students to inspect for waste. The inspection revealed that due to the corruption of bourgeois ideology and the remnants of American imperialist cultural aggression, the university widely exhibited serious phenomena of wasting national property and failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. The initial exposure of these facts made the vast majority of faculty, staff, and students realize the harm of bourgeois ideology and American imperialist cultural aggression to Yenching University. Therefore, students and staff, with anger, made sharp criticisms of the university's administrative leadership, transforming the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in the university into a thorough criticism of bourgeois ideology and opposition to American imperialist cultural aggression.
    In the early stage of the movement, the university's administrative leadership did not pay enough attention to the movement and acted passively. Most teachers also lagged behind the students and staff in the movement due to their own bourgeois ideology and pro-American, worship-America sentiments. Therefore, in mid-February, the university's Thrift Examination Committee called on all teachers to generally "get into the water and take a bath," to transform their thinking; thus, a deep ideological struggle unfolded among the vast majority of faculty, staff, and students. Young students, with a responsible attitude and full of enthusiasm, repeatedly raised solemn opinions to the teachers. The teachers also enthusiastically responded to the call, and, based on the opinions raised by each other and the opinions of the students, repeatedly made relatively deep self-criticisms on their political stance, academic viewpoints, work attitude, etc., at the department-level teacher-student meetings. These self-criticisms exposed the serious pro-American, worship-America sentiments among the teachers, further clarifying the line between the enemy and ourselves in the teachers' thinking. For example, Zhao Chengxin, a professor in the Department of Sociology, in order to become a so-called "international scholar," collected a lot of political and economic information to supply to American imperialism. In his self-criticism, he said: "This is actually selling out the interests of the motherland, how painful this is!" Cai Liusheng, a professor in the Department of Chemistry, even sent his own paper to the United States in the summer of 1950 and encouraged students to study in the United States. He made a painful self-criticism on this: "This is a concrete manifestation of failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, an act of helping the tiger devour people." Other teachers also exposed their pro-American, worship-America thoughts. For example, some people only believed in American magazines, thinking that they could not do research without American magazines; some even had to send their broken watches to the United States for repair. In the self-criticisms, bourgeois ideology among the teachers was also exposed, and the teachers' understanding of the corrupting influence of bourgeois ideology was enhanced. For example, Jiang Yinen, a professor in the Department of Journalism, criticized his own pursuit of fame and profit. He used to regard the journalism education career as capital, thinking that if the Department of Journalism was famous and had status, he would also gain fame and profit. Xu Xianyu, a professor in the Department of Mathematics, criticized his view of not asking about politics. Students also received a great education while analyzing and discussing the teachers' self-criticisms. After the professors of the Department of Western Languages criticized the poisoning of the students' minds by their own erroneous thoughts, many students who had never been willing to participate in patriotic movements also criticized their own individualism, not asking about politics, and other thoughts. Therefore, teachers and students more clearly realized the harm of American imperialist cultural aggression and corrupt bourgeois ideology to themselves, and urgently demanded to transform their thinking. They unanimously condemned American imperialist cultural aggression with a heavy heart, criticized corrupt bourgeois ideology, and demanded that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement be carried through to the end! In this way, not only was the ranks of activists expanded, but the ranks were also rectified and had stronger combat effectiveness.
    On February 25, the university's Thrift Examination Committee held a meeting of all cadres and teachers, at which the gains of the previous stage of work were summarized, and it was pointed out that the focus of the movement in the future would shift from the department level to the whole university, to fully expose the influence of American imperialist cultural aggression and find out the main root causes hindering the progress of Yenching University. At this time, the university's Thrift Examination Committee held an "Exhibition of Crimes of American Imperialist Cultural Aggression," providing ironclad evidence of American imperialism using Yenching University to carry out cultural aggression and espionage activities. Seeing these undeniable facts, the masses no longer had any doubts. Everyone felt that American imperialists and their agents were "bringing toxins into our brains like spreading bacteria." Everyone unanimously demanded that those who wore all kinds of disguises, but actually echoed American imperialism and continued to implement American imperialist aggressive policies, make public self-criticisms. Zhang Dongsun, chairman of the Department of Philosophy of the university, made two self-criticisms at the joint teacher-student meeting of the four departments of History, Philosophy, Chinese Literature, and Psychology on February 8 and 20, and made a third self-criticism at the university-wide teacher-student meeting on February 26. The university's Thrift Examination Committee held a university-wide teacher-student-staff meeting on February 29 to discuss Zhang Dongsun's previous self-criticisms. This discussion trained the masses' ability to analyze everything from the perspective of the people. Some people said: "Our eyes are getting brighter and brighter, and we have more confidence in carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle." On March 10, the university's Thrift Examination Committee held another university-wide teacher-student-staff meeting, at which it launched a serious criticism of the various erroneous thoughts and actions of Zhao Zichen, Dean of the Theological Seminary, which greatly educated all the people who attended the meeting. On the 11th, President Lu Zhiwei also made a self-criticism at the teacher-student meeting. All faculty, staff, and students are now conducting group discussions separately and are preparing to further launch discussions throughout the university.

    批判资产阶级思想、肃清美帝国主义文化侵略影响
    燕京大学思想斗争进入高潮
    燕京大学的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动已经进入高潮。运动在一月下旬是从发动全校师生员工检查浪费开始的。在检查中发现学校中由于资产阶级思想的腐蚀以及美帝国主义文化侵略的遗毒，普遍存在着浪费国家财产和敌我不分的严重现象。这些事实的初步揭露，使广大的师生员工看清了资产阶级思想和美帝国主义的文化侵略对燕京大学的危害性。因此，学生、职工以愤怒的心情对学校行政领导部门提出了尖锐的批评，使学校中的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，形成为彻底批判资产阶级思想和反对美帝国主义文化侵略的斗争。
    在运动初期，学校行政领导方面对运动很不重视，表现消极。而一般教员，由于自己有资产阶级思想和亲美崇美思想，在运动中也落后于学生和职工。因此，该校节约检查委员会在二月中旬号召全校教员普遍下水洗澡，改造思想；于是在广大的师生员工中展开了深刻的思想斗争。青年学生以负责的态度，情绪饱满地对教员再三提出严正的意见。教员也热烈响应了号召，根据相互间提出的意见和学生的意见反覆在系级师生大会上对自己的政治立场、学术观点、工作态度等作了比较深刻的检讨。这些检讨，暴露了教员中严重的亲美崇美思想，使教员在思想上进一步划分了敌我界限，如社会系教授赵承信为了想做所谓“国际学者”，曾收集了很多政治、经济情况，供给美帝国主义。他在检讨时说：“这实际上就是出卖了祖国的利益，这是多么痛心的事！”化学系教授蔡馏生，在一九五○年夏天还把自己的论文寄往美国，并且鼓励同学到美国去留学。对此，他沉痛地作了检讨：“这是敌我不分的具体表现，是为虎作伥的行为。”其他教员也揭发了自己的亲美崇美思想。例如有的人只相信美国杂志，认为没有美国杂志就不能研究学问；有的甚至坏了手表也要寄到美国去修理。在检讨中，也暴露了教员中的资产阶级思想，提高了教员对资产阶级腐朽思想的认识。如新闻系教授蒋荫恩检讨了自己的名利思想。他过去把新闻教育事业看作资本，认为新闻系有名气有地位，自己也就有名利了。数学系教授徐献瑜检讨了自己不问政治的观点。学生们在分析和讨论教员的检讨时，也受到了很大的教育。西语系教授在检讨了自己的错误思想对同学们思想上的毒害之后，使许多从来不愿参加爱国运动的同学也检讨了自己的个人主义、不问政治等思想。教员和学生因此更清楚地认识到了美帝国主义文化侵略和资产阶级腐朽思想对自己的危害，迫切要求改造思想。他们一致以沉痛的心情控诉了美帝国主义的文化侵略，批判了资产阶级腐朽思想，并要求把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进行到底！这样，不但扩大了积极分子的队伍，而且使队伍得到了整顿，有了更坚强的战斗力。
    二月二十五日，该校节约检查委员会召开全体干部和教员大会，会上总结了上一阶段工作的收获，指出今后运动的重点是由系级转向全校，充分揭发美帝国主义文化侵略的影响，找出阻碍燕京大学进步的主要根源。这时，该校节约检查委员会举办了“美帝国主义文化侵略罪行展览会”，提供了美帝国主义利用燕京大学进行文化侵略和谍报活动的铁证。看到这些不可否认的事实，群众再也没有怀疑了。大家感到美帝国主义者及其代理人像“撒细菌一样地将毒素带到我们脑子里”。大家一致要求那些披着种种外衣，但实际上和美帝国主义东西呼应，继续执行美帝国主义侵略政策的人公开检讨。该校哲学系主任张东荪于二月八日和二十日在历史、哲学、国文、心理四系联合师生大会上作了两次检讨，于二月二十六日在全校师生大会作了第三次检讨。该校节约检查委员会于二月二十九日召开全校师生员工大会，对张东荪历次的检讨展开讨论，这次讨论，锻炼了群众站在人民的立场分析一切事物的能力，有人说：“咱们的眼睛越练越亮了，进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的信心更足了。”三月十日，该校节约检查委员会又召开全体师生员工大会，对宗教学院院长赵紫宸的各种错误的思想和行动，展开了严正的批评，使全体到会群众受到很大教育。十一日，陆志韦校长也在师生大会上作了检讨，全校师生现正在分别进行小组讨论，并准备进一步展开全校范围的讨论。
