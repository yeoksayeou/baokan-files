Economic Life Brief Commentary

    All Regions Should Pay Attention to Pest Control Early
    The weather was warmer last winter, and not many pests died. In addition, some areas did not pay attention to pest control last winter, so there is still a possibility of serious pest outbreaks this year. Agricultural production leading organs in various regions should lead the masses to take effective prevention and control measures as early as possible.
    In areas where rice borers are serious, continuous prevention and control must be carried out during the borer's latent period. At present, we should step up spring plowing and irrigation, pick up and destroy rice roots, and massively eliminate rice borer larvae. Areas that are about to be sown must prepare suitable seedling fields to catch moths and collect eggs. Spring control of rice borers is the primary key to overcoming rice borer damage. We must vigorously develop this work to ensure that rice is not or is less affected by insect pests.
    Cotton aphids were common in all cotton-producing areas last year. In addition to fully preparing medicines and machinery, these areas should immediately mobilize the masses to clear weeds from fields, roadsides, field edges, and graves. Sow thistle and summer solstice grass are the main hosts of cotton aphids and must be uprooted and burned, never thrown in the fields so cotton aphids can breed. Pomegranates and hibiscus are also major overwintering hosts of cotton aphids. Before cotton seedlings emerge, these trees should be carefully inspected, and if cotton aphids are found, they should be sprayed immediately to eliminate them and prevent harm to cotton seedlings.
    In areas where locusts were severe last year, egg surveys should be strengthened. In some areas, although autumn plowing was carried out to kill eggs last year, only a portion was eliminated. Therefore, in all areas where locusts occurred last year, after the thaw, it is necessary to seize the time to carry out egg surveys and regularly scout for locust egg hatching to fully organize forces and immediately capture and kill locusts as soon as they occur to completely eliminate them. In areas where underground pests are serious, red arsenic, white arsenic, or sodium fluorosilicate must be prepared early and sown into the soil with the seeds during sowing for prevention and control.
    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Southern Jiangsu, Songjiang and other places should quickly supply pig feed to farmers
    Farmers in Songjiang and Nanhui counties in Southern Jiangsu have recently been selling and slaughtering pigs in large numbers, which seriously affects this year's pig raising and manure accumulation work. In order to increase production for the country, farmers in these areas responded to the government's call to raise pigs and accumulate manure in last winter's production and generally raised pigs. Taking Songjiang County as an example, more than 70,000 households in the county raised more than 80,000 pigs. However, this spring, farmers in some areas have successively sold or slaughtered their pigs. Many of the slaughtered pigs are small pigs that have not yet grown up, and even pregnant sows.
    The main reason why the masses of farmers sell and slaughter pigs is the lack of pig feed. They said, "They will starve to death if they are not killed." The farmers in this area all use bran and rice bran to raise pigs. Songjiang County needs more than 320,000 catties of bran every day. Due to the relaxation of business by the county cooperative and the shutdown of several rice mills, the supply of bran and rice bran has been hindered.
    Another reason why the masses of farmers in these areas sell and slaughter pigs is that the sales of pigs are not good, and farmers are afraid of losing money by raising pigs. Due to the relaxation of business by the cooperative, pig dealers took the opportunity to lower prices in rural areas, making the price of pigs more than half lower than at the end of last year.
    These two problems must be solved immediately. Cooperatives in southern Jiangsu must allocate clean and capable cadres to strengthen daily business work, and rice mills should also resume normal operations to help farmers solve the difficulty of insufficient bran and rice bran. The problem of pork sales must be considered early by cooperatives and native product companies to achieve large-scale consignment sales; otherwise, it will inevitably affect farmers' interest in raising pigs and hinder the increase in agricultural and sideline production.

    经济生活简评
    各地应及早注意防治虫害
    去冬气候较暖，害虫死亡不多；加以有些地区在去冬没有注意进行除虫工作，今年虫害仍有严重发生的可能。各地农业生产领导机关，应该领导群众，及早采取有效的防治措施。
    螟虫为害严重的地区，必须在螟虫潜伏时期，进行连续的防治。目前应加紧进行春耕灌水，拾毁稻根，大量消灭稻螟幼虫。将要播种的地区，一定要做好合式秧田，以便进行捕蛾采卵。春季治螟是战胜螟害的首要关键，必须大力开展这一工作，以保证水稻不受或少受虫害。
    各产棉区去年曾普遍发生棉蚜，这些地区，目前除应充分准备药械外，应即发动群众清除田间、路旁、地边和坟头的杂草。苦荬菜、夏至草是棉蚜的主要寄主，必须连根拔起，带回烧毁，切不可扔在田间，使棉蚜得以滋长。石榴、木槿也是棉蚜的主要越冬寄主；在棉苗未出土前，要对这些树木仔细检查，如发现棉蚜，应即喷药消灭，以免贻害棉苗。
    去年蝗虫严重发生的地区，目前应加强查卵工作。有些地区，去年虽曾进行秋耕灭卵，但也仅仅消灭了一部分。因此，凡是去年发生蝗虫的地区，在开冻以后，必须抓紧时间，进行查卵工作；并应经常侦察蝗卵孵化情形，以便充分组织力量，在蝗虫刚一发生时，立即进行捕打，使之彻底消灭。地下害虫严重的地区，必须及早准备红砒、白砒或氟矽酸钠等，在播种时和种子一起播入土中，加以防治。
    苏南松江等地的供销合作社应赶快给农民供应养猪饲料
    苏南区松江、南汇两县农民，近来大批卖猪、杀猪，严重地影响了今年养猪积肥工作。这些地区的农民，为了爱国增产，在去年冬季生产中响应政府养猪积肥的号召，普遍地养了猪。以松江县来说，全县七万多户即养猪八万多口。但是，今春若干地区的农民却相继把猪卖掉或杀掉了。所杀的猪很多都是没有长成的小猪，甚至是怀孕的母猪。
    农民群众卖猪杀猪的主要原因是猪的饲料不足。他们说：“不杀死也要饿死。”这一带的农民都是用麸皮和米糠养猪。松江县每天约需麸皮三十二万多斤。由于县合作社放松了业务和若干加工米厂停了工，麸皮、米糠的供应受到了妨碍。
    这些地区农民群众卖猪杀猪的另一原因是猪的销路不好，农民怕养猪蚀本。由于合作社放松业务，猪贩子在农村中乘机压价，使猪的价格比去年年底时降低一半还多。
    这两个问题必须立即设法解决。苏南地区的合作社必须抽出手脚干净和有能力的干部加强日常业务工作，加工米厂也应照常开工，帮助农民解决麸皮、米糠不足的困难。猪肉销路问题，合作社和土产公司必须早为考虑，作到大批代销；否则势必影响农民养猪的兴趣，妨碍农业副业的增产。
