    I request to go to the front line to undertake transportation work
    To strike back against the shameless crimes of American imperialism
    Comrade Editor: On February 27th, the People's Daily published an article about four female volunteer army truck drivers who safely completed 8,000 kilometers of driving in an extremely difficult combat environment. I deeply admire their noble internationalism and patriotism. Furthermore, upon seeing reports in the newspaper about American imperialism launching bacteriological warfare, I am filled with extreme indignation. In March 1951, I was injured on a train while on duty, and the organization took care of me with utmost dedication. First, they sent me to a hospital for treatment, and later they sent me to the well-equipped and scenic Qingdao "All-China Federation of Trade Unions Sanatorium" for recuperation. Such preferential treatment for workers would not be possible without the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Now, I want to recuperate peacefully, and after being discharged from the hospital, I will request that my superiors approve my request to go to the Korean front line to undertake transportation work, to emulate comrades like Meng Qingyun, and to strike back against the shameless and heinous crimes of American imperialism with practical actions.

    我要求到前线担任运输工作
    回击美帝国主义的无耻罪行
    编辑同志：二月二十七日人民日报登载志愿军四位汽车女司机，在极端艰苦的战斗环境中，安全完成了行车八千公里的任务。她们这种崇高的国际主义和爱国主义的行动，使我无限崇敬。我又见到报上登载着美帝国主义发动细菌战争的消息，愤恨之极。一九五一年三月，我在列车上因公负伤，组织照顾我真是尽心周到。先把我送到医院里治疗，以后又送我到设备完善、风景幽美的青岛“中华全国总工会疗养院”休养。对工人这样优待，若不是共产党和毛主席的英明领导，怎么可能呢？现在我要安心休养，出院后我要要求上级批准我去朝鲜前线，担任运输工作，向孟庆云等同志看齐，以实际行动来回击美帝国主义这种无耻的滔天罪行。
