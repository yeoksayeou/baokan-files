    The Correct Handling of the Zhou Jifang and Song Ying Conspiracy Case
    Further Demonstrates that the Communist Party is a Champion of Truth
    To the Editor: The correct handling of the errors of Zhou Jifang, Song Ying, and others has once again made me realize that the Chinese Communist Party always stands on the side of the working class and the people, and wages a merciless struggle against all vile behaviors that violate the interests of the people. The Chinese Communist Party is a champion of truth. No matter who it is, if they violate the interests of the people and break the laws of the country and Party discipline, they will be severely punished. This matter tells us that we must be vigilant against the attacks of the bourgeoisie and eradicate all bad influences left over from the bourgeoisie and the old society.   Lu Jing
    To the Editor: From the Zhou Jifang and Song Ying frame-up case, we can see that within our revolutionary ranks, within our Party, there are still a few lawless bad elements who hold important positions in revolutionary work and are doing things similar to counter-revolutionaries. Wherever these bad elements go, the work there will suffer. We must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate all the bad elements hidden in our revolutionary ranks and within our Party in order to purify the Party organization and consolidate our people's regime. Yao
    To the Editor: The Zhou Jifang and Song Ying case shows that once bourgeois toxins corrode Party members and cadres, they will undermine the internal unity of the revolution and reduce the Party's combat strength. At the same time, it further shows that the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks are all-pervasive. Therefore, we must resolutely and thoroughly counterattack this offensive without any relaxation in our struggle.
    Li Ying
    To the Editor: Wu Defeng and Xie Bangzhi have consistently lacked a democratic style and are also characterized by serious subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, which led them to shield lawless elements. This is extremely bad. Therefore, the dismissal of their positions inside and outside the Party is entirely justified. From this incident, we can see the importance of adhering to the Party's principle of struggle. We should learn from the spirit of comrades Ji Kaifu, Wang Shixun, and others who adhered to the principle of struggle, and carry the anti-corruption revolutionary struggle to the end.
    Beijing Industrial School Correspondence Group
    To the Editor: We believe that Comrade Ji Kaifu is a Youth League member with a high degree of principle. For the sake of the people's interests, he adhered to the principle of struggle against all kinds of unreasonable slanders and frame-ups, without any negativity or wavering. Every Youth League member participating in the anti-corruption movement should learn from Ji Kaifu's spirit of upholding the truth and completely eliminate corruption.

    对周季方宋瑛阴谋案的正确处理
    再一次说明共产党是真理的坚持者
    编辑同志：对周季方、宋瑛等错误的正确处理，使我再一次认识到中国共产党是永远站在工人阶级和人民的立场与一切违反人民利益的恶劣行为作无情的斗争的。中国共产党是真理的坚持者。不管什么人，如果违反了人民利益，违犯了国法党纪，一定要受到严厉处分。这件事告诉了我们：必须警惕资产阶级的进攻，必须根除资产阶级及旧社会遗留下来的一切坏影响。    鲁敬
    编辑同志：从周季方、宋瑛陷害案中可以看到，在我们革命阵营中，在我们党内，还有少数无法无天的坏分子，他们担任着革命工作的要职，做着类似反革命的事情。这些坏分子走到那里，那里的工作就会受到损失。我们必须坚决地、彻底地把隐藏在我们革命阵营中和我们党内的一切坏分子清除出去，以纯洁党的组织，巩固我们的人民政权。  遥
    编辑同志：周季方、宋瑛案件说明，资产阶级的毒素，一旦侵蚀到党员干部身上，就会破坏革命内部的团结，降低党的战斗力量。同时更说明了资产阶级的猖狂进攻是无孔不入的。因此，我们必须坚决地、彻底地对这一进攻进行无情的反击，绝不能放松我们的战斗。  
    李婴
    编辑同志：吴德峰和谢邦治等一贯地缺乏民主作风，又加上严重的主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义，以致庇护了不法分子，这是极恶劣的。因此，撤销他们在党内外的职务，也是完全应该的。从这一事件中可以看到坚持党的原则斗争的重要性。我们应该学习纪凯夫、王世勋等同志那种坚持原则斗争的精神，把反贪污的革命斗争进行到底。
    北京工业学校通讯组
    编辑同志：我们认为纪凯夫同志是一个具有高度原则性的青年团员，为了人民利益，他在各种无理的诬蔑和陷害中坚持原则斗争，丝毫没有消极和动摇。我们每一个参加反贪污运动的青年团员，应该学习纪凯夫这种坚持真理的精神，彻底消灭贪污现象。
