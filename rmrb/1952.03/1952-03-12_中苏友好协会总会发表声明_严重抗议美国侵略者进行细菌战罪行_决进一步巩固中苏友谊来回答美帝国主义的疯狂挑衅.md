(Xinhua News Agency, March 11th) The All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association issued a statement on the 10th, strongly protesting the heinous crimes of American imperialism in conducting germ warfare. The full text of the statement is as follows:

While delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, American imperialism, in order to prolong and expand the war of aggression against Korea, has recently spread bacterial insects in the Korean front and rear, as well as within the territory of Northeast China. This inhuman, vicious, and extremely brutal crime is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The Association, representing all its members, expresses its greatest indignation.

The American aggressors brazenly trampled on international law by conducting germ warfare, attempting to invade China and threaten the safety of the Chinese people. But this will not only fail to intimidate the Chinese people, it will only further arouse the righteous indignation of the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the people of the world, strengthening their determination to crush the conspiracy of aggression. The unparalleled strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, especially the fraternal and unbreakable unity of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, has become an indestructible and strong fortress. Any conspiracy and provocation of the American aggressors will undoubtedly be crushed before this fortress.

We fully support the solemn statements made by Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai on February 24th and March 8th. We believe that the towering crimes of the American aggressors will inevitably suffer the incomparably heavy blows and punishments of the Chinese and Korean people, and these war criminals who use bacteriological weapons will be subjected to the most severe sanctions by the peace-loving people of the world.

We are determined to carry the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy through to complete victory, resolutely repel the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, consolidate the people's democratic regime, strengthen national defense, and further consolidate the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union to answer the mad provocations of the American aggressors!

All-China Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
March 10th

    严重抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战罪行
    决进一步巩固中苏友谊来回答美帝国主义的疯狂挑衅
    【新华社十一日讯】中苏友好协会总会十日发表声明，严重抗议美帝国主义进行细菌战的滔天罪行。声明全文如下：
    美帝国主义在拖延朝鲜停战谈判的同时，为了延长和扩大侵朝战争，最近竟在朝鲜前线和后方，以及在我国东北境内撒布细菌毒虫，这一灭绝人性的、穷凶恶极的残暴罪行，是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。本会代表全体会员表示最大的愤怒。
    美国侵略者悍然蹂躏国际公法进行细菌战，妄图侵略中国、威胁中国人民的安全。但这不但不能吓倒中国人民，它只会更加激发中国人民、朝鲜人民和全世界人民的义愤，加强他们粉碎侵略阴谋的决心。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的无比强大，特别是中苏两大民族兄弟般的牢固团结，已成为不可摧毁的坚强堡垒，美国侵略者的任何阴谋与挑衅，都必将在这个堡垒面前被粉碎无疑。
    我们完全拥护我外交部周恩来部长二月二十四日与三月八日两次严正的声明。我们相信，美国侵略者的滔天罪行，必将遭受中朝人民无比沉重的打击和惩罚，这些使用细菌武器的战争罪犯，必将遭受全世界爱好和平人民的最严厉的制裁。
    我们决心将反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进行到彻底胜利，坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，以巩固人民民主政权，加强国防，并进一步巩固中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，来回答美国侵略者的疯狂挑衅！
    中苏友好协会总会
