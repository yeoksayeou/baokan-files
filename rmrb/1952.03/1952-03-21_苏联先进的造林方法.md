    Advanced Soviet Afforestation Methods

    I recently learned that the western part of Northeast China will also construct shelterbelts. This large-scale plan to transform nature, like the harnessing of the Huai River, is exciting. Now, I will introduce the advanced afforestation methods recommended in Soviet newspapers recently for reference.

    The Soviet plan to transform nature stipulates the construction of more than 6 million hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of shelterbelts in the grassland and forest-grassland areas of the European part by the end of 1965. In order to complete this enormous task, and to create forests that supply timber for the long term with minimal manpower and resources, the most effective afforestation methods are needed. The oak cluster planting method (hereinafter referred to as cluster planting method) developed by Soviet Academician Lysenko has proven to be the most valuable afforestation method in practice. The advantages of the oak cluster planting method are: economy, high tree survival rate, and rapid growth. This method began to be adopted in 1949. In that year, more than 4,000 hectares were trial-planted using this method, and in the following two years, hundreds of thousands of hectares were planted, with good results. Wherever the climate and soil conditions are suitable for planting oak trees, this method will be adopted. Clustered oaks will account for 60 percent of the constructed shelterbelts.

    Academician Lysenko's oak cluster planting method was created from the centuries of afforestation experience of Russia and the Soviet Union and his following theory: that there is no competition within the same species in nature, only competition between different species. The actual situation in the past three years has proven the correctness of this theory. Many three-year-old oak trees grown after cluster planting are densely packed together, and weeds cannot invade. Small oak trees grown after cluster planting are more resistant to grassland winds and other natural disasters than row-planted small oak trees. The more small oak trees in a cluster, the better they grow. Academician Lysenko believes that trees have self-thinning characteristics: non-competing trees of the same kind, after growing densely, will naturally die off in part to support a certain density of treetops. So, there is no fear of planting densely. This has also been proven by facts.

    Oak trees live long, can be planted in many places, and are of great value for protecting farmland and supplying timber. The oak cluster planting method is as follows: In a square meter of land, dig a small round hole in each of the four corners and in the center, and plant six to eight acorns in each hole. The five small round holes form a cluster. After the small trees in the central small round hole grow, they quickly become closely connected with the small trees grown in the four corner small round holes; in this way, the small trees are more resistant to drought, cold, and weeds. There is a spacing of two to three meters between one cluster and another, and a spacing of four to five meters between one row and another. In the first few years, the afforestation ground is planted with crops at the same time, using crops to protect the seedlings: after the crops grow, weeds cannot grow, resist the scorching sun in summer, and resist cold and gather snow in winter; at the same time, due to reducing the care of the seedlings, the land is also used, and the manpower and resources for afforestation can be greatly saved. The oak trees planted in this way grow very fast, and even faster in the third year than in the first two years. Within three years, the oak trees planted in clusters in the dry grassland areas of southern Soviet Union have grown to 25 to 40 cm, and in the black soil grassland areas, they have grown to 40 to 60 cm (some have grown to 1 meter). In the Kursk region, the cluster edge of the three-year-old oak trees has expanded from the original one meter to an average of 1.65 meters. If this development continues, the clusters (separated by two meters) can be connected in four or five years, and the rows (separated by four meters) can be connected in ten to twelve years.

    The cluster planting method is superior to the row planting method. According to a survey in 1948, there were 37-year-old oak trees planted in clusters and rows in the Tula region. The oak trees planted in clusters were 16.7 meters high, while those planted in rows were only 14.2 meters high, that is, the cluster-planted ones were 2.5 meters higher than the row-planted ones. In the Michurinsky District of the Tambov region, a piece of land was planted with oak acorns in clusters in the spring of 1949, and at the same time, a piece of land was planted with two- to four-year-old oak seedlings in rows. By October 1951, according to the statistics of 100 cluster-planted oak trees and more than 100 row-planted oak trees, the three-year-old cluster-planted oak trees were on average 48 cm high, while the five- to seven-year-old row-planted oak trees were only 24 cm high; in 1951, the cluster-planted ones grew an average of 18 cm, while the row-planted ones grew an average of only 8 cm; the cluster-planted ones had an average of 72 leaves per plant, while the row-planted ones had an average of only 44 leaves per plant.

    The cluster planting method requires much less labor than the insertion planting method. The Stalin Collective Farm in the Kotovsk District of the Odessa region planted two hectares of oak trees in 1949, spending an average of 121 labor days per hectare per year for planting and care; in 1950, 51 hectares of oak acorns were planted in clusters, spending an average of only 22 labor days per hectare per year for collecting oak acorns, planting, care, and cultivating the crops that sheltered the oak trees; in 1951, caring for the cluster-planted small oak trees required nine-tenths less labor than caring for single small oak trees.

    In the first few years of cluster planting oak trees, if crops are planted at the same time, less labor is required and the oak trees grow well. According to the results of an investigation of oak trees pulled out of the fields in the Kursk region, the one-year-old oak trees planted in clusters under the shelter of buckwheat were 11.5 cm high (measured from the ground), the trunk diameter was 2.9 mm, the trunk including branches and leaves weighed 1 gram, and the total area of all the leaves was 41 square cm; the one-year-old oak trees planted in clusters without the shelter of crops were 7.6 cm high, the trunk diameter was 2.9 mm, the trunk including branches and leaves weighed 0.9 grams, and the total area of all the leaves was 27 square cm. The crops used as shelter vary from place to place, including wheat, millet, corn, and potatoes; the yield of the crops has not decreased. Cluster-planted oak trees with crop cover grow best on fallow land. This is because fallow land has been cultivated and has no weeds, and stores nutrients and moisture. The Voroshilov Collective Farm in the Yelansky District of the Stalingrad region planted oak acorns in clusters on fallow land in 1950, and by the autumn of 1951, an average of 33 small trees grew in each cluster, while those planted in clusters on the autumn-plowed land in 1950 grew an average of only 9 small trees in each cluster.

    For the oak acorns used for afforestation, the Soviet people always select good ones so that they can be sprouted and planted in clusters in time. According to a study by an experimental station in the Kuibyshev region, using sprouted oak acorns for cluster planting increased the emergence rate from 62 percent to 93 percent, and the emergence time of the seedlings was also accelerated, increasing the height at one year from 13 cm to 21 cm.

    According to the principle that trees of the same kind do not compete, there is more fear of having too few oak acorns for cluster planting than too many. Academician Sukachev, the leader of the Forest Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, recently proposed reducing the number of six to eight oak acorns that should be planted in each small round hole in the cluster to three to five. Academician Lysenko criticized this opinion at a meeting on shelterbelts convened by the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture in February. Lysenko pointed out that facts have proven that the denser the oak acorns in a cluster, the better.

    The oak cluster planting method has become the basic method of afforestation in the Soviet Union. It will shorten the time limit for completing the plan to transform nature, and it will accelerate the growth of shelterbelts.

    苏联先进的造林方法
    最近知道我国东北区西部也要营造防护林带了。这个大规模的改造自然计划，和修治淮河一样，是令人兴奋的。现在把近来苏联报纸上推荐的先进的造林方法介绍过来，以供参考。
    苏联改造自然计划规定到一九六五年底在欧洲部分的草原区和森林草原区营造六百多万公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）防护林带。为了完成这个巨大的任务，为了以最少的人力、物力营造长远地供应木材的树林，需要最有效的造林方法。苏联李森科院士研究出的橡树簇状播种法（以下简称簇种法），在实践中被证明是最宝贵的造林方法。橡树簇种法的好处有：经济、树木成活率高、成长迅速。这个方法一九四九年就开始被采用。这一年用这种方法试种了四千多公顷，其后两年种了几十万公顷，效果都好。凡是气候、土壤条件可种橡树的地方，都将采用这种方法。簇种的橡树将占营造的防护林带的百分之六十。
    李森科院士的橡树簇种法，是从俄国和苏联百年来的造林经验和他的如下理论创造出来的，这种理论就是：自然界没有同类之内的竞争，只有异类之间的竞争。三年来实际情形证明了这个理论的正确性。许多簇种后长出来的三岁小橡树，密集一块，野草侵袭不进去。簇种后长出来的小橡树，比排植的小橡树更能抵抗草原上的旱风和其他自然灾害。一簇之内小橡树愈多，长得愈好。李森科院士认为树木有自稀的特性：不竞争的同类树木，稠密地生长之后，为了支持树梢一定的密集程度，部分树木自会正常地死掉。所以不怕种得密。这也由事实证明了。
    橡树活得久，可种的地方多，对防护农田和供应木材都有重要价值。橡树簇种法是这样的：在约一平方公尺的方块土地上，四角和中央各挖一个小圆穴，每穴种六个到八个橡实。五个小圆穴组成一簇。中央小圆穴的小树生长后，很快地和四角小圆穴长出的小树密接起来；这样小树更能抗旱、抗寒、抗野草。一簇和另一簇之间相隔两、三公尺，一行和另一行之间相隔四、五公尺。造林的地面，头几年同时种农作物，借农作物来保护树苗：农作物生长后，野草不能生长，夏天抵抗灼热的太阳，冬天抗寒聚雪；同时由于减少对树苗的一番照料，又使用了土地，造林的人力、物力就可以大大地节省下来。这样簇种的橡树长得很快，第三年比头两年更快。三年内在苏联南部干燥草原区簇种的橡树已长到二十五至四十公分，在黑土草原区已长到四十至六十公分（个别有长到一公尺的）。在库尔斯克州，三岁小橡树的簇边已由原来的一公尺扩展到平均一·六五公尺。这样发展下去，簇与簇（相隔两公尺）四、五年内可以衔接，行与行（相隔四公尺）十年到十二年内可以衔接。
    簇种法优越于排植法。据一九四八年调查，图拉州有簇种和排植的三十七岁橡树。簇种的橡树高十六·七公尺，排植的只高十四·二公尺，即簇种的高过排植的二·五公尺。坦波夫州米丘林区一九四九年春天用橡实簇种了一块地，同时用两岁到四岁小橡树排植了一块地。到一九五一年十月，根据对一百株簇种的和一百多株排植的橡树的统计，簇种的三岁橡树平均高四十八公分，而排植的五岁到七岁橡树只高二十四公分；在一九五一年中，簇种的平均长十八公分，而排植的平均只长八公分；簇种的平均每株有七十二片树叶，排植的平均每株只有四十四片树叶。
    簇种法比插植法少花许多劳动力。敖德萨州高托甫区的斯大林集体农场，在一九四九年植了二公顷橡树，连植树带照料，每公顷土地上一年平均花一百二十一个劳动日；一九五零年簇种了五十一公顷橡实，连收集橡实、种、照料带耕耘那些掩护橡实的农作物，每公顷土地上一年平均只花二十二个劳动日；一九五一年照料簇种的小橡树比照料单株小橡树少花九分劳动力。
    簇种橡树的头几年，如果同时种农作物，既少花劳动力，橡树也长得好。据考察从库尔斯克州田野上拔出来的橡树的结果，在荞麦掩护下簇种的一岁橡树，树干高（从地面量起）十一·五公分，树干直径二·九公厘，树干连枝叶重一克，所有叶子的面积共四十一平方公分；没有在农作物掩护下簇种的一岁橡树，树干高七·六公分，树干直径二·九公厘，树干连枝叶重○·九克，所有叶子的面积共二十七平方公分。作为掩护的农作物，各地不一样，有种麦子的，有种粟的，有种包谷、马铃薯的；农作物的收获量并没有减少。有农作物掩护的、簇种的橡树，在休耕地上长得最好。因为休耕地经过耕耘没有野草，并且积蓄着养分和水分。斯大林格勒州叶兰斯基区的伏罗希洛夫集体农场，一九五零年在休耕地上簇种橡实，到一九五一年秋天平均每簇长三十三株小树，而在一九五零年秋季翻耕地上簇种的平均每簇只长九株小树。
    对于造林用的橡实，苏联人总是挑选好的，使它们发芽以后就及时地簇种下土。据古比雪夫州一个实验站研究，用发芽的橡实簇种，出苗率从百分之六十二提高到百分之九十三，树苗出长的时间也加快了，一岁时高度从十三公分增加到二十一公分。
    根据同类不竞争的道理，簇种的橡实怕少不怕多。苏联科学院森林研究所领导人苏卡契夫院士，最近曾提议把簇内每个小圆穴中应种的六个到八个橡实，减低到三、五个。李森科院士在二月间苏联农业部召开的关于防护林带的会议上，批评了这种意见。李森科指出，事实证明，一簇内橡实愈密愈好。
    橡树簇种法，已成为苏联造林的基本方法。它将缩短改造自然计划完成的期限，它将加速防护林带的成长。
