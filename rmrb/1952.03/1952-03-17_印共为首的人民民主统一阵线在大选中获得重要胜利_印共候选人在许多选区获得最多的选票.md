Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 15th: The first Indian general election, which began last winter, concluded in early March. The People's Democratic United Front, led by the Communist Party of India (CPI), achieved a significant victory in the election. The election results indicate that the CPI has become the strongest opposition party in the Indian Parliament and the state (provincial) assemblies of Madras, Hyderabad, West Bengal, Travancore-Cochin, and Tripura.

According to an election bulletin issued by the Indian government's press office, the results of the People's Assembly (note: The People's Assembly is the lower house, with a total of 497 seats, of which 489 are elected and 8 are appointed by the President of India) are as follows: the Indian National Congress won 362 seats, the Communist Party of India and its United Front won 39 seats (of which 17 seats were directly elected from the CPI candidate list), the Indian Socialist Party 12 seats, the Hindu Mahasabha 4 seats, and other smaller parties and independents a total of 72 seats.

In the state (provincial) assembly elections, the Communist Party of India and its United Front won a total of 239 seats. The Madras Legislative Assembly has a total of 375 seats, with the Congress Party winning 152 seats and the CPI winning 64 seats. The West Bengal Legislative Assembly has a total of 238 seats, with the Congress Party winning 150 seats and the CPI-led United Front winning 45 seats. The Hyderabad Legislative Assembly has 175 seats, with the Congress Party winning 93 seats and the People's Democratic United Front winning 42 seats. The Travancore-Cochin Legislative Assembly has 108 seats, with the Congress Party winning 44 seats and the Leftist United Front winning 37 seats. The CPI also had seven candidates elected as members of the Orissa Legislative Assembly, and five candidates elected as members of the East Punjab Legislative Assembly. The Bombay United Front had three candidates elected. The Assam United Front had one candidate elected. In the Tripura Electoral College, the CPI and the alliance of democratic parties obtained 20 of the Electoral College's total of 30 seats.

In this general election, the Congress Party won a majority of seats in the Parliament and most state (provincial) legislative assemblies, but the number of votes it received was less than half of the total votes cast by the electorate. The candidate who received the most votes in a single constituency was Ravi Narayan Reddy, a CPI leader in Telangana, who received 300,962 votes. The second highest was Acharu, another CPI leader in Telangana, who received 282,117 votes. The Congress Party candidate with the most votes received only 233,571 votes.

In this election, Communist Party of India candidates defeated ministers of the Indian central government and state (provincial) governments to win their elections. For example, in the election for members of the People's Assembly, Nambiar, the leader of the South Indian Railway Workers' Union, defeated the Indian Minister of Railways, Santhanam; CPI leader Rama Rao defeated the Indian Deputy Minister of Food, Trimul Rao. CPI leader Hanumantha Rao defeated Chandramouli, a minister in the Madras provincial government. In West Bengal province, seven of the twelve ministers who participated in the election were defeated. Among them, Kalipada Mukherjee, the Labor Minister of the West Bengal provincial government, was defeated by Bankim Mukherjee, the CPI leader and General Secretary of the All India Farmers' Association; Education Minister Chowdhury was defeated by Basu, a member of the CPI Politburo; Revenue Minister Bimal Singh was defeated by Prabash Roy, a CPI leader and prominent peasant organizer.

The People's Democratic United Front movement launched under the leadership of the Communist Party of India is the foundation of this victory. The development of the United Front throughout the country shows that this movement has broad connections with the people. Although India does not yet have a nationwide United Front organization, this movement is currently continuing to develop throughout the country. The CPI's allies in the United Front in various states (provinces) include: the Forward Bloc in West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar and other provinces (note: India has two Forward Blocs, one Marxist group and one Ruiker group. The former is referred to here.), the Peasants and Workers People's Party in Malabar and several constituencies in Andhra Pradesh in Madras province, the Peasants and Workers Party in Maharashtra in Bombay province, the Kerala Socialist Party and the Revolutionary Socialist Party in Travancore-Cochin province, the People's Democratic United Front in Hyderabad, and independents in several states.

The Indian Socialist Party suffered a serious defeat in this general election. After the general election, a large number of Socialist Party members left the party to protest against the pro-American and anti-people policies of the Indian Socialist Party's leadership.

    印共为首的人民民主统一阵线在大选中获得重要胜利
    印共候选人在许多选区获得最多的选票
    【新华社新德里十五日电】去年冬天开始的印度第一次大选，已在三月初结束。以印度共产党为首的人民民主统一阵线在选举中获得了重要胜利。选举结果表明：印度共产党已在印度国会以及马德拉斯、海得拉巴、西孟加拉、特拉凡哥尔—柯钦和特里波拉等邦（省）议会中成为最强大的反对党。
    据印度政府新闻局发表的选举公报，人民院（按：人民院即下院，共有四百九十七席，其中四百八十九席由选举产生，八席由印度总统指定）的选举结果如下：印度国大党获得三百六十二席，印度共产党和它所领导的统一阵线获得三十九席（其中十七席是由印共候选人名单中直接选举出来的），印度社会党十二席，印度教大会四席，其他的许多小党派和无党派人士共七十二席。
    在各邦（省）议会的选举中，印度共产党和它所领导的统一阵线共获得二百三十九席。马德拉斯省立法会议共有三百七十五席，国大党得一百五十二席，印共得六十四席。西孟加拉省立法会议共有二百三十八席，国大党得一百五十席，印共领导的统一阵线得四十五席。海得拉巴邦立法会议共有一百七十五席，国大党得九十三席，人民民主统一阵线得四十二席。特拉凡哥尔—柯钦邦立法会议共有一百零八席，国大党得四十四席，左翼党派统一阵线得三十七席。印共并有七个候选人当选为奥里萨省立法会议议员，五个候选人当选为东旁遮普省立法会议议员。孟买统一阵线有三个候选人当选。阿萨姆统一阵线有一个候选人当选。在特里波拉选举团中，印共和各民主党派的联盟得到选举团的总共三十席中的二十席。
    在这次大选中，国大党获得了国会和大多数邦（省）立法会议的多数席位，但是它所得的票数还不到选举人所投总票数的一半。而在单独一个选区得票最多的是特仑甘纳印共领袖拉维·纳拉因·莱迪，他得到三十万零九千一百六十二票。其次是特仑甘纳的另一位印共领袖阿查鲁，他得到二十八万二千一百十七票。而国大党得票最多的候选人所得票数只有二十三万三千五百七十一票。
    印度共产党候选人在这次选举中，打败了印度中央政府和邦（省）政府的部长而胜利获选。例如，在人民院议员竞选中，南印度铁路工人工会领袖南姆比尔打败了印度政府铁道部长山萨南；印共领袖拉码·拉奥打败了印度政府粮食部次长特里玛尔·拉奥。印共领袖汉努曼塔·拉奥打败了马德拉斯省政府的部长昌德穆里。在西孟加拉省，参加竞选的十二个部长有七个被击败。其中，西孟加拉省政府劳工部长卡里巴达·穆克吉败于印共领袖、全印农民协会总书记班金·穆克吉；教育部长乔度里败于印共政治局委员巴苏；税务部长比马尔·辛格败于印共领袖、卓越的农民组织者普罗巴施·罗埃。
    在印度共产党领导下发动的人民民主统一阵线运动，是这次胜利的基础。全国各地统一阵线的发展显示这个运动与人民有着广泛的联系。虽然印度现在还没有全国性的统一阵线的组织，但这个运动目前正在全国各地继续发展着。印共在各邦（省）的统一阵线的同盟者有：西孟加拉、奥里萨、比哈尔等省的前进同盟（按：印度有两个前进同盟，一个是马克思主义集团，一个是瑞克尔集团。这里指的前者。），马德拉斯省马拉巴和安得拉的几个选区的农工人民党，孟买省马哈拉施特拉的农工党，特拉凡哥尔—柯钦邦的喀拉拉社会党和革命社会党，海得拉巴的人民民主统一阵线以及好些邦的无党派人士。
    印度社会党在这次大选中遭到严重失败。大选以后，社会党大批党员纷纷脱党，以示对印度社会党领导机构的亲美反人民的政策的抗议。
