    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 14th: The federations of returned overseas Chinese in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Jinjiang County have issued a joint statement, representing the returned overseas Chinese and their families in Fujian Province, strongly protesting the Thai reactionary government's barbaric increase of the "Foreigner's Personal Identification Fee," a criminal measure to further persecute overseas Chinese. The statement pointed out: The vast majority of our overseas Chinese in Thailand are shop assistants, coolies, small vendors, and farmers, living in extreme poverty. Shop assistants and coolies, for example, earn only dozens or a little over one hundred Thai Baht per month, which is not even enough to support their families. Now the Thai government has increased the "Foreigner's Personal Identification Fee" from 20 Baht to 400 Baht per person per year, which will inevitably plunge the vast majority of overseas Chinese into a miserable situation where they cannot make a living and are forced to wander from place to place. The purpose of this reactionary measure by the Thai government is to force overseas Chinese who are unable to pay the "fee" to work as forced laborers or even serve as soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, in order to facilitate the US imperialists' conspiracy to use Thailand as a base to drive the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army to harass our border. The statement firmly stated: The vast number of returned overseas Chinese, their families, and the people of the whole country will never tolerate this atrocity of the Thai reactionary government and all measures to persecute overseas Chinese. We are determined to support the just struggle of the overseas Chinese in Thailand to protect their own survival and rights.

    福州厦门等地归国华侨
    抗议泰国政府暴行
    【新华社福州十四日电】福州、厦门、泉州三市及晋江县归国华侨联谊会发表联合声明，代表福建省归国华侨和华侨家属，严重抗议泰国反动政府蛮横增加“外侨随身证例费”，进一步迫害华侨的罪恶措施。声明指出：我国旅泰侨民绝大部分是店员、苦力、小商贩、农民，生活十分贫穷，如店员、苦力每人每月只有数十铢或一百多铢泰币的收入，尚不足维持家庭生活。现泰国政府把“外侨随身证例费”由每人每年二十铢增加到四百铢，必将使绝大部分华侨陷于无以度日、颠沛流离的惨境。泰国政府这种反动措施的目的，是迫使无力缴纳“例费”的侨胞充当苦工，或甚至充当蒋匪军队的士兵，以便利美帝国主义以泰国作基地，驱使蒋匪军侵扰我国边境的阴谋活动。声明坚决表示：我国广大归国华侨、华侨家属和全国人民，决不能容忍泰国反动政府这种暴行和一切迫害华侨的措施。我们决心支持旅泰侨胞为保护自己的生存和权益的正义斗争。
