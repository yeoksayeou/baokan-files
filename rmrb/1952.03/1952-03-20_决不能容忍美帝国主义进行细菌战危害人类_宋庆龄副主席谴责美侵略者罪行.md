Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 19th: Soong Ching Ling wrote an article condemning the towering crime of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. Soong Ching Ling's article said:

The whole world is angrily condemning: "A shameful, unforgivable crime!" From every corner of the world, the broad masses of people are pointing at the United States with contempt and indignation, leveling accusations. The tide of anger against the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea continues to rise.

The American aggressors strafe peaceful laborers in the Korean fields. They use gasoline bombs to burn down even the smallest villages far from the front lines, and they bomb prosperous cities into ruins. Now, they are committing a monstrous crime, attempting to destroy the entire people of Korea and China with germ warfare. No wonder people all over the world initially found such barbaric acts by the United States almost unimaginable, and subsequently were aroused to boundless anger, rising up to protest. No wonder the Chinese and Korean people’s demand to judge the perpetrators of such heinous crimes as war criminals has gained strong support everywhere.

We must declare that the people of the world, especially the people of China and Korea, will never tolerate such acts of violence that endanger humanity. The international laws that define aggression and mass slaughter as crimes are well known. Resolutions passed by the World Peace Council and other peace organizations, calling for the cessation of such international crimes, have already gained the active support of hundreds of millions of people. Based on this position, we want to warn the American government, which is controlled by a small group of financial magnates, military personnel, and politicians: "You are fully responsible for all the destruction and every death and injury caused in Korea! We will judge your use of bacteriological weapons as a serious international crime!"

The American aggressors have committed this new crime, but dare not tell their own people. They know how much anger and unease this would cause! American spokesmen have resorted to all sorts of shameless denials. American newspapers and radio stations spread various rumors and slanders to divert attention and cover up their own crimes. They attempt to shift the responsibility for the spread of epidemics onto the Chinese and Korean people; however, they will absolutely not succeed in this.

American aggressors! You will absolutely not escape responsibility! We hold the evidence. The mark "Made in America" is crystal clear. The evidence itself accuses: we have placed it before the people of the world for everyone to judge. We have once again exposed your heinous crimes against humanity; exposed that you have fallen to the lowest level, even using Japanese war criminals, who have already been convicted for engaging in bacteriological warfare, as accomplices; exposed that in order to achieve your most heinous "mission," you do not hesitate to continue to taint the name and purpose of the United Nations.

Frankly speaking, you miscalculated from the beginning. The world has changed. You simply do not know this China, this Korea. What you are facing are People’s Republics, where love for our motherland and the path we have chosen for ourselves have become unwavering beliefs in the hearts of all workers, farmers, students, youth, and women and children. None of your conspiracies, including this most vicious conspiracy, can shake us in the slightest or stop us from moving forward. We have organized ourselves to confront and defeat your threats; and in this great battle, we have the material and spiritual support of all peace-loving people.

American aggressors: In the eyes of the people of the world, you are criminals; the Chinese and Korean people will surely achieve victory; we will persevere in the struggle to defend peace to the very end.

    决不能容忍美帝国主义进行细菌战危害人类
    宋庆龄副主席谴责美侵略者罪行
    【新华社上海十九日电】宋庆龄撰文谴责美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的弥天大罪。宋庆龄的文章说：
    全世界都在怒声谴责：“可耻的、不可饶恕的犯罪！”从世界每一个角落，广大人民以蔑视和激愤的心情，指着美国发出控诉。抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜暴行的怒潮，不断地在高涨。
    美国侵略者扫射着朝鲜田野中的和平劳动者。他们用汽油弹把远离火线的最小村庄都一起烧光，他们把过去繁荣的城市炸成废墟。现在他们又在干下弥天大罪，要用细菌战争毁灭朝鲜和中国的全体人民。无怪全世界人民对于美国这种野蛮暴行，最初认为简直不堪想像，其后就激起了无边愤怒，纷纷起来抗议，也无怪中朝人民提出把干着这种万恶罪行的凶手判定为战争罪犯的要求，到处都获得了有力的支持。
    我们要声明，全世界人民，特别是中朝人民，决不能容忍这种危害人类的暴行。把侵略和集体屠杀定为犯罪的国际法规，是人所共知的。世界和平理事会与其他和平团体通过决议，要求制止这种国际间的犯罪行为，已经获得了亿万人民的积极拥护。根据这样的立场，我们要向那个被一小撮财阀、军人与政客所操纵的美国政府发出警告：“你们对于在朝鲜所造成的一切毁坏与每一个人民的死伤，要全部负责！我们要把你们的使用细菌武器，作为一个严重的国际犯罪行为，来加以裁判！”
    美国侵略者干下了这种新罪行，但是不敢告诉他们自己的人民。他们知道这会引起多大的震怒和不安！美国发言人采用了种种的无耻抵赖。美国的报纸和广播散布了各种造谣诽谤，来分散注意，掩盖其本身的罪行。他们企图把疫病传染的责任推在中朝人民身上；然而，这点他们绝对作不到。
    美国侵略者们！你们绝对逃不了罪责！我们掌握着证据。“美国制造”的记号是清清楚楚的。证据的本身在控诉：我们已经把它放在全世界人民的面前，让大家来裁判。我们已经再一次揭露了你们的伤天害理的罪行；揭露了你们已堕落到最卑下的程度，甚至利用因从事细菌战而已被判罪的日本战犯来作帮凶；揭露了你们为要达到你们穷凶极恶的“使命”，不惜继续沾污联合国的名义和宗旨。
    老实说，你们从开头就估计错了。世界已经变了。这个中国，这个朝鲜，你们根本不认识。你们所面对的是人民共和国了，在这里，对于我们祖国的热爱，以及我们自己所决定的道路，已经在所有工人、农民、学生、青年、以及妇女儿童的心中，成为坚定不渝的信念。你们的任何阴谋，包括这次最恶毒的阴谋，都不能摇动我们一点，或阻止我们前进。我们已经组织起来对付和击败你们的威胁；而在这一场伟大的战斗中，我们有着全部和平人民的物质上与精神上的支援。
    美国侵略者们：在全世界人民的眼中，你们是犯罪者；中朝人民一定会取得胜利；我们要把保卫和平的斗争坚持到底。
