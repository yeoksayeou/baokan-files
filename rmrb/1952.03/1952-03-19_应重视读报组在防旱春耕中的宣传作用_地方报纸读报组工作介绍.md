We should emphasize the propaganda role of reading groups in drought prevention and spring plowing
——Introduction to the work of local newspaper reading groups

Drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing production are currently the overriding central tasks in rural areas. Editorial departments of newspapers such as the "Chahar Daily," "Suiyuan Daily," "Shanxi Peasant," and Hunan's "Zijiang Peasant" have successively issued instructions to rural reading groups to strengthen drought prevention and conduct extensive propaganda activities among the masses. They have also published reports on the activities of reading groups in drought prevention, drought resistance, and preparation for spring plowing. Local newspapers, especially peasant newspapers, should emulate the practices of these newspapers, strengthen their leadership over reading groups, and enable them to play their due role in propaganda and organization in drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing production.

Local newspapers emphasize the propaganda and mobilization power of reading groups in rural drought prevention work

According to reports from various newspapers, many peasants, and even some district and village cadres, currently harbor a侥幸 mentality. They say:

"It's still far from planting season. If we work hard now, won't it all be in vain if it rains!" A few lazy people believe that the People's Government will come to "rescue" them anyway. In response to these erroneous ideas, the Suiyuan Daily Reading Group recently issued a "Notice" calling on reading group members in agricultural and pastoral areas to discuss and publicize the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government's "Emergency Instructions on Preserving Moisture and Preventing Drought" and the report by Yang Zhilin, Vice Chairman of the province, at the provincial agricultural and pastoral production and disaster relief meeting. It also suggested that reading groups invite experienced farmers to discuss the drought prevention and resistance work in their villages and promote farmers to formulate plans for digging wells, opening canals, and rationally organizing labor. The Chahar Daily editorial department called on rural reading groups in the province to carry forward the propaganda and organizational role they played in the spring drought resistance planting and summer drought resistance preparation last year, and asked reading group members to play a greater role in propaganda, mobilization, and organizing the masses this year. The newspaper also praised the achievements of the reading groups in Sanjie, Huailai County, and Tanggongwa Village, Zhangbei County, in publicizing drought prevention work.

Newspapers report extensively on reading groups taking the lead in drought prevention activities

Organizing reading group competitions to expand the guiding role of newspapers

These newspapers used a lot of space to publish reports on the activities of rural reading groups in the drought prevention movement. After reading the State Council's instructions on drought prevention and resistance, the reading group in Taohaoban Village, Guisui County, promoted the village and a dozen nearby villages to negotiate, abolish feudal water regulations, and jointly open a 23-li long and 1.5-zhang wide canal, which guaranteed irrigation water for more than 200 hectares of land. In addition, it mobilized farmers in the village to dig an earthen well every three households. The farmers said with full confidence: "Eight tenths of our village's land was plowed last year. This year, we will ensure careful harrowing, ensure early planting of seeds, and not waste an acre of land, and strive for a bumper harvest this year!" The Shanxi Peasant Newspaper used the entire space of the first and second editions on February 29 to publish articles on reading group activities. At the discussion meeting of the Wei Shibin reading group in Lingchuan County, it was affirmed that the best way to prevent drought is to fully and rationally utilize all water sources and promote the experience of preserving moisture, seizing moisture, and planting drought-resistant crops. Under the active leadership of the reading group, 56 mutual aid groups have been formed in Wei Shibin's village, six dry wells have been dug, and 50 mu of soil have been improved. The newspaper also launched a "How does your reading group promote drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing preparation?" essay contest on the second edition. The Zijiang Peasant Newspaper recently used a fixed four-column space on each issue to exclusively publish activities of reading groups in drought prevention and resistance in various places. For example, farmers in Fenggongmiao, Chengbei Township, Shaoyang City, Hunan Province, formed a drought prevention mutual aid group under the leadership of the reading group, and have now started to repair public ponds and dig mountain trenches. The newspaper's editorial department also consciously organized reading groups in other villages to launch a competition with the Fenggongmiao reading group, which is a good way to expand the guiding role of the newspaper and is worth promoting.

Many examples prove that reading group members are not only powerful propagandists in rural areas, but also collective organizers of production and political movements. All localities should attach importance to and strengthen the leadership of reading group activities.

    应重视读报组在防旱春耕中的宣传作用
    ——地方报纸读报组工作介绍
    防旱、抗旱、春耕生产是农村当前压倒一切的中心任务。“察哈尔日报”、“绥远日报”、“山西农民”和湖南“资江农民”等报纸的编辑部，已先后向农村读报组发出加强防旱和在群众中进行广泛宣传活动的指示，并陆续发表了各地读报组在防旱、抗旱和准备春耕工作中的活动情况。地方报纸，尤其是农民报，应当仿效这些报纸的作法，加强对于读报组的领导，使之在防旱抗旱和春耕生产中，发挥应有的宣传、组织作用。
    各地报纸强调读报组在农村防旱工作中的宣传鼓动力量
    根据各地报纸反映，许多地区的农民，甚至一部分区、村干部，目前还存在着侥幸思想，他们说：
    “离种地还远着哩，现在忙一阵子，一下雨还不是白费劲！”有少数懒汉则认为，反正人民政府会来“救济”。针对这些错误思想，绥远日报读报工作组在最近发出“通知”，号召农牧业区读报组员讨论和宣传绥远省人民政府关于“保墒防旱紧急指示”及该省杨植霖副主席在全省农牧业生产与救灾保畜会议上的报告，并建议读报组邀请有经验的农民，座谈本村的防旱抗旱工作，推动农民订立打井、开渠和合理组织劳动力的计划。察哈尔日报编辑部号召该省农村读报组发扬在去年春季抗旱点种和夏季抗旱备荒中的宣传、组织作用，要求读报组员在今年发挥更大的宣传鼓动和组织群众的力量。该报还表扬了怀来县三街、张北县唐贡洼村读报组宣传防旱工作的成绩。
    报纸大量报道读报组带头防旱活动
    组织读报组竞赛扩大报纸指导作用
    这些报纸用大量篇幅刊登农村读报组在防旱运动中的活动情况。归绥县讨号板村读报组读了政务院关于防旱抗旱的指示后，就推动该村和附近十来个村庄协商，废除封建水规，伙开一条二十三里长、一丈五尺宽的水渠，这样就保证了二百多顷地的浇灌用水。另外，并发动该村农民每三家伙打一眼土井。农民们满有信心地说：“去年我村的地已有八成翻过，今年保证仔细耙耱，保证种籽早下土，不荒一亩地，争取今年的丰收！”山西农民报在二月二十九日用一版和二版的全部篇幅，刊登读报组活动的稿件。陵川县魏世斌读报组的讨论会上，肯定了防旱的最好办法是充分和合理利用一切水源，推广保墒、抢墒、抗旱下种的经验。在读报组积极带头下，魏世斌所在村已组成了五十六个互助组，打旱井六眼，改良土壤五十亩。该报并在二版上举办了“你们读报组是怎样推动防旱抗旱和准备春耕工作”的征文。资江农民报在最近每期的报面上，用固定四栏地位专刊各地读报组在防旱抗旱中的活动。如湖南邵阳市郊城北乡凤公庙的农民，在读报组的带领下，组成了防旱互助组，现已动手修公塘、挖山圳。该报编辑部并有意识地组织其他村庄读报组向凤公庙读报组展开竞赛，这是一种扩大报纸指导作用的好方法，很值得推广。
    许多事例证明，读报组员不但是农村中的有力宣传者，而且是生产运动和政治运动的集体组织者，各地应当重视和加强对读报组活动的领导。
