Illegal Capitalists Turn the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China into Their Own Private Treasury
By our reporter Lin Mo

For more than three years since the liberation of Tianjin, it has been a major port for foreign trade in the country. In order to sell a large number of local products and some agricultural products abroad, and in exchange for industrial equipment and other supplies, the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China has provided huge loans to support Tianjin's import and export traders. However, some illegal traders believe that this is a good opportunity for them to make a fortune and frantically attack the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China, usurp the leadership of loans, and undermine the country's loan policy, grabbing a large amount of money into their own pockets from this gap. They are like big stink bugs, drinking the blood of the country and the people.

In August 1950, a restaurant called "Songzhumei" was opened on Liaoning Road, Tianjin. The shareholders included the managers of five trading companies, including Xinfeng and Fengchang, as well as Cai Bingheng, the deputy chief of the loan section, and Zhao Xuegong, the head of the pledge group, of the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China. This "elegant" restaurant, specially set up, was the secret meeting place for these thieves to steal state loans. Formally, their loans were "approved" after layers of review and stamping in the office building of the bank; but in reality, many people's loans were secretly agreed upon in this restaurant. Bourgeois economic spies such as Cai Bingheng and Zhao Xuegong often reported confidential information to their masters here; at the same time, they also helped those masters who lacked or had no loan collateral to plan how to underreport or where to borrow collateral. Some illegal traders gradually learned that this was a black market for loans, so through layers of introduction, they brought their wives, young ladies, or dancers and singers in groups to eat, drink, and win over. It was also very convenient for them to bribe, and the manager of the restaurant could be responsible for collecting and transferring.

The Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China also stipulates in the loan system and procedures: the loan section conducts investigation and review of the loan applicants; the section chief reviews; and the manager and deputy manager finally stamp and approve. However, the actual decision-making power is in the hands of the personnel below the loan section. As long as the section agrees, the section chief and manager will stamp it as usual. The cadres of the loan section are all retained personnel, and the main responsible personnel, such as Deputy Chief Cai Bingheng, Head of the Pledge Group (responsible for managing collateral) Zhao Xuegong, and Field Staff (responsible for investigating loan applicants) Yang Xueliang, were all from bourgeois backgrounds and lived very corrupt lives. Their families and relatives all opened factories and shops, and some were engaged in trading.

Not long after liberation, in the spring of 1949, illegal traders began to attack the loan section. Kong Xiangsheng, the manager of Xinfeng Trading Company, wanted to defraud state loans, so he took cigarettes, candy, and a flattering face, and climbed onto the counter of the bank all day long, trying to persuade and wear down the staff. Kong Xiangsheng wanted to bribe, and Cai Bingheng and others wanted to embezzle, so they naturally hit it off. One day, Cai Bingheng sent Kong Xiangsheng a "donation request," saying that a friend's servant had died and asked Kong to donate funeral expenses. Kong Xiangsheng knew that the attack had been won, so the next day he not only sent money, but also invited Cai, Zhao, and others to eat and drink. At that time, the managers of three trading companies, Zengshengchang, Qilong, and Yifeng, also accompanied them. These people had all discussed with Kong Xiangsheng in advance to build relationships with Cai Bingheng and others. Since then, this group of profiteers colluded with Cai Bingheng and others to steal state loans by various means.

Xinfeng Company, owned by Kong Xiangsheng, did not engage in foreign trade after liberation. Dozens of workers in his shop were dedicated to processing export bristles for the North China Branch of the China Bristle Company. At this time, Kong Xiangsheng bribed the loan personnel of the bank on the one hand, and bribed the cadres of the bristle company on the other hand, and used the processed bristles as collateral to defraud loans from the bank one after another. Zengshengchang Trading Company had no collateral at all, but could still get loans.

Some illegal traders learned that loans could also be obtained by these methods, so they used various methods to build relationships with Cai Bingheng and Zhao Xuegong. Some people heard that Cai, Zhao, and others often went to dance halls to dance, so they tried to find dancers who were familiar with them to carry out activities. Xinzhong Native Produce Trading Company was introduced by the dancer Li Yuhua and obtained a loan. When Xinzhong Native Produce Trading Company applied for its first loan, the field staff of the loan section went to Xinzhong Native Produce Trading Company to investigate and found that the shop looked like a cotton cloth shop, not a trading company. They went in and asked the manager, who said, "Aren't you from Yuhua (i.e., dancer Li Yuhua)?" meaning that we are all our own people, so there is no need to be formal. This trading company, which was about to collapse, used the name of a dancer to obtain 15 loans totaling 1.54 billion yuan from August to December 1951.

Ding Yaquan, the manager of Yuanxing Carpet Factory, also frequented dance halls for a period of time in order to win over the loan section personnel through dancers. He recognized six or seven dancers who often danced with Cai Bingheng, Zhao Xuegong, etc. as "god-daughters." Through these "god-daughters," he got to know Cai Bingheng, Zhao Xuegong, Yang Xueliang, etc., and obtained loan convenience. In 1949, Yuanxing Carpet Factory was just a carpet processing workshop with only seven female workers, a small room, a coal stove, and a broken table. After defrauding loans to do business, it has now developed into a carpet factory with more than 250 workers and has acquired real estate. He defrauded a total of 22.6 billion yuan in loans, and still owes 2.1 billion yuan. Some traders said:
"Ding Yaquan has connected with the cadres of the Bank of China, so he doesn't need to worship the God of Wealth anymore!"

Bourgeois spies Cai Bingheng and Zhao Xuegong colluded with the big profiteers who acted as their accomplices and almost bought over all the personnel of the loan section of the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China. They carried out a series of fabrications and deceptions, from the investigation and approval of loan profiteers to the verification and management of collateral. More than 20 illegal traders colluded with Cai Bingheng, Zhao Xuegong, and others. No matter what kind of rascals and swindlers these profiteers were, Cai, Zhao, and others always wrote "strong capital," "good credit," and "sufficient collateral" on the credit investigation forms.

Cai Bingheng and Zhao Xuegong were very loyal in serving the profiteers. Taifeng Trading Company, which had defrauded 29 billion yuan in loans, had no collateral when it first applied for a loan. Cai Bingheng asked them to borrow a batch of straw braid from Shengxifu Straw Hat Shop as collateral. Later, when Taifeng Company applied for another loan, they didn't even bother with fake collateral. They first borrowed money from the bank and then bought goods on the market as collateral. Once, after borrowing money from the bank, Cai Bingheng called Shen Erchang, the export manager of Taifeng Trading Company, and said that the bank was going to inspect the collateral. Shen said, "Don't come yet. The goods have just arrived and haven't been loaded into the warehouse yet." After everything was done, Shen called and said, "Come and inspect it. It's all done." They colluded with each other to steal state property in this way. Mai Junlin, the manager of Fengchang Trading Company, who had defrauded 3.2 billion yuan in loans, was originally the son-in-law of the big traitor Pan Yugui and an officer of the Kuomintang bandit army. He fled to Taiwan with the Kuomintang bandit gang before the liberation of Shanghai, and returned to Tianjin in 1949. Cai Bingheng, Zhao Xuegong, Yang Xueliang, and others knew him in the past, so Yang Xueliang introduced him to work in Fengchang Trading Company, which was run by his father-in-law. At this time, Fengchang Trading Company had a remaining cash balance of 9,600 yuan, and they had not had money to pay the water and electricity bills for three months and were about to close down. At this time, Cai Bingheng and others colluded with Mai Junlin and continuously issued several loans to Fengchang. Mai Junlin used state loans to do business, and when he made money, he spent lavishly, eating, drinking, and dancing with Cai Bingheng and others all day long. They were shareholders of the "Songzhumei" restaurant and regulars of the Huizhong Dance Hall. According to statistics, Mai Junlin has squandered more than 700 million yuan personally in the past two years. Seeing that loans were so convenient, Mai Junlin also joined Zhao Xuegong's father and Li Xiqing, the chief of the loan section, and two others to open a Yitong Trading Company. This trading company had not yet opened, but it borrowed money from the bank through Cai Bingheng. The field staff of the loan section went to investigate according to the address they wrote down, and went twice. A woman who opened the door said impatiently, "This is the 'Jia residence,' not a trading company!" When Cai Bingheng heard the report from the field staff, he called Mai Junlin and said, "You are really absurd. How can you apply for a loan without even having a house?" Mai Junlin said:
"What's so absurd about that? You lend me the money first, and then I'll have everything, including the house and the collateral, right?" Mai Junlin, this complete rogue and scoundrel, when the bank's field staff sometimes went to check his loan usage
(this kind of inspection was mostly to cope with the task), he said impatiently, "What are you checking? I'm not using your money to visit prostitutes!" And turning around, he openly said to people: "The Bank of China is my treasury. I can use the money whenever I want, as much as I want." This group of rascals, profiteers, and spies have been occupying the loan department of the state bank for the past three years, wantonly stealing huge sums of state money. Now, the profiteer spy Cai Bingheng, Zhao Xuegong, and the big profiteers Shen Erchang, Mai Junlin, etc. have been arrested by the people's court and will be severely punished by state law.

    违法资本家把中国银行天津分行放款机构变成了自己的账房
    本报记者  林沫
    天津解放三年多以来，一直是全国进行对外贸易的主要港口。为了把大量的土产和一部分农产品推销到国外，并换回工业器材及其他用品，中国银行天津分行曾以巨额贷款扶助天津的进出口贸易商。而一些违法贸易商们却认为这是他们发横财的好机会，疯狂地向中国银行天津分行进攻，篡夺贷款的领导权，破坏国家的贷款政策，从这个缺口把大量的金钱抓到自己的口袋里。他们一个个像大臭虫一样，喝足了国家和人民的血。
    一九五○年八月间，在天津辽宁路新开了一家名叫“松竹梅”的饭馆，股东有新丰、丰昌等五家贸易行的经理和中国银行天津分行放款股副股长蔡秉衡、质押组组长赵学恭。这个特别设置得很“雅致”的饭馆，就是这伙盗贼偷窃国家贷款的秘密会议场所。形式上，他们的贷款是在银行大楼的办公室里经过层层审查、盖章，才得到“批准”的；但实际上，有很多人的贷款是在这个饭馆里暗中议定的。资产阶级的经济坐探蔡秉衡、赵学恭等，经常在这里向他们的主子们报告机密的消息；同时，还帮助那些缺少或没有贷款押品的主子们，筹划如何以少报多，或到什么地方去借押品。一些违法贸易商们渐渐探听到这里是贷款的黑市，于是通过层层介绍，带着自己的太太、小姐或者是舞女、歌女，成群结队地到这里来吃喝拉拢。他们要行贿也很方便，饭馆的经理就可以负责收转。
    中国银行天津分行在放款的制度和手续上，同样规定有：放款股对贷款户进行调查、复核；科长审查；经理、副理最后盖章批准。但实际决定权却操在放款股以下的人员手里。只要股里同意了，科长、经理就照样盖章。放款股的干部都是留用人员，而主要负责人员副股长蔡秉衡、质押组（负责管理押品）组长赵学恭、外勤（负责调查贷款户）杨学良等，都是资产阶级出身，生活非常腐化。他们的家属、亲友都开厂设店，有的就经营着贸易行。
    解放后不久，一九四九年春季，违法贸易商们就开始向放款股进攻了。新丰贸易行经理孔翔生想骗取国家贷款，他就带着纸烟、糖果和一副谄媚的面孔，整天爬在银行的柜台上，软泡，硬磨。孔翔生想行贿，蔡秉衡等想贪污，自然一拍即合。蔡秉衡有一天送给孔翔生一张“捐启”，说是一个朋友的用人死了家属，请孔捐助葬埋费。孔翔生知道进攻已经得胜，第二天不但送了钱，还请蔡、赵等去吃喝一顿。当时奉陪的还有增升昌、启隆、义丰等三家贸易行的经理，这些人都是预先和孔翔生商量好了，一同来和蔡秉衡等拉关系的。从此，这个奸商集团就和蔡秉衡等勾结起来，用各种方法盗窃国家贷款。
    孔翔生的新丰号解放后并没有经营对外贸易，他店里的几十个工人，是专门给中国猪鬃公司华北区公司进行出口猪鬃加工生产的。这时，孔翔生一方面买通了银行放款人员，一方面又买通了猪鬃公司的干部，就拿加工的猪鬃作押品，一笔接着一笔地向银行骗取贷款。增升昌贸易行根本没有押品，也一样可以贷到款。
    一些违法贸易商探听到用这些办法也可以抓到贷款，他们就用各种办法来和蔡秉衡、赵学恭拉关系。有人听说蔡、赵等常到舞场跳舞，就设法找到和他们熟识的舞女进行活动。新中土产贸易行就是由舞女李玉华从中介绍，得到贷款的。新中土产贸易行第一次贷款时，放款股的外勤人员到新中土产贸易行去调查，发现这个铺子只像一家棉布店，不像什么贸易行；他们进去问经理，经理却说：“你们不是玉华（即舞女李玉华）的人吗？”意思是说咱们都是自己人，不用外气。这家已经快要垮台的贸易行就用一个舞女的名字，从一九五一年八月到十二月，贷款达十五笔，共十五亿四千多万元。
    源兴地毯厂经理丁雅泉为了通过舞女拉拢放款股的人员，有一个时期也经常跑舞厅；他并把经常和蔡秉衡、赵学恭等跳舞的六七个舞女认作“干女儿”，经过“干女儿”结识了蔡秉衡、赵学恭、杨学良等，取得了贷款的方便。源兴地毯厂一九四九年时还只是一个仅有七个女工、一间小屋、一个煤球炉和一张破桌子的地毯加工作坊；经过骗贷款做生意，现在已发展为拥有二百五十多工人的地毯厂，并且置了房产。他前后共骗到贷款二百二十六亿元，现在还拖欠着二十一亿元没有归还。有的贸易商说：
    “丁雅泉拉上了中国银行的干部，就不用再敬财神爷了！”
    资产阶级的坐探蔡秉衡、赵学恭勾结和他们狼狈为奸的大奸商，差不多收买了中国银行天津分行放款股的全部人员。他们从对贷款奸商的调查、核批到押品的查对和管理，进行了一系列的捏造和欺骗。和蔡秉衡、赵学恭等勾结的违法贸易商有二十多家。不论这些奸商是一些什么样的流氓和骗子，蔡、赵等在徵信调查表上总是写着“资金雄厚”“信誉良好”“押品充足”。
    蔡秉衡、赵学恭替奸商服务是十分忠心的。曾先后骗取贷款二百九十亿元的泰丰贸易行，在开始贷款时没有押品，蔡秉衡就让他们借盛锡福草帽庄一批草帽辫作押品。后来泰丰行再贷款时，连假押品也不搬弄了。他们先从银行贷到款，再到市场上买了货作押品。有一次从银行把款贷出以后，蔡秉衡电话通知泰丰贸易行出口部经理沈尔昌，说银行要去检查押品。沈说：“先不要来，货刚到，还没装好仓库哩。”到一切办妥之后，沈才打电话说：“来人检查吧，已经搞好了。”他们就这样串通一气盗骗国家财产。曾骗到贷款三十二亿元的丰昌贸易行经理麦君麟，原是大汉奸潘毓桂的女婿、国民党匪军军官。他在上海解放前曾随国民党匪帮逃往台湾，一九四九年，又回到天津。蔡秉衡、赵学恭、杨学良等因过去和他相识，因此就由杨学良介绍到他岳父经营的丰昌贸易行去作事。丰昌贸易行这时所剩账存资金共有九千六百元，他们已经三个月没有钱付水电费，眼看就要关门。这时，蔡秉衡等就和麦君麟串通接连放给丰昌几笔贷款。麦君麟拿着国家贷款作生意，赚了钱就大肆挥霍，整天和蔡秉衡等吃喝、跳舞。他们是“松竹梅”饭馆的股东，又是惠中舞厅的熟客。据统计，两年多以来，麦君麟个人挥霍即达七亿多元。麦君麟见贷款这么方便，又和赵学恭的父亲及放款股股长李锡庆的岳父等三人合开了一个益同贸易行。这家贸易行还没有开张，就通过蔡秉衡向银行贷款。放款股的外勤人员根据他们写下的地址去调查，连去了两次，出来开门的一个妇女不耐烦地说：“我们这是‘贾宅’，不是什么贸易行！”蔡秉衡听到外勤人员的报告，就打电话对麦君麟说：“你实在太荒唐了，怎么连房子都没有就打出招牌来贷款？”麦君麟却说：
    “这有什么荒唐？你先把钱贷给我，连房子带押品，不什么都有了吗？”麦君麟，这个十足的流氓和恶棍，当银行的外勤人员有时去检查他的贷款用途时
    （这种检查多半是为着应付差事），他就不耐烦地说：“检查什么？又不拿你们的钱去嫖窑子！”而一转脸，他就又公开地对人说：“中国银行就是我的账房，我什么时候用款都可以，要多少有多少。”这一伙流氓、奸商和坐探们，三年来就是这样窃据国家银行的放款部门，放肆地偷盗国家的巨款。现在奸商坐探蔡秉衡、赵学恭和大奸商沈尔昌、麦君麟等已由人民法院分别逮捕，并将受到国法的严厉制裁。
