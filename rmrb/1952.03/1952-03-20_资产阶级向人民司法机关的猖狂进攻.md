    The Frenzied Attack of the Bourgeoisie on the People's Judicial Organs
    Li Jianfei
    From the day the bourgeoisie participated in the people's democratic dictatorship, due to their nature of harming others to benefit themselves, being solely profit-oriented, and engaging in speculation, they began to attack state financial organs and state-owned enterprises. At the same time, they also adopted extremely malicious methods to infiltrate the people's judicial organs, attempting to seize leadership. The current “Three-Anti” and “Five-Anti” struggles have preliminarily exposed the severity of the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on the people's judicial organs.
    In the past three years, the bourgeoisie has used illegal means such as bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work and the theft of state economic intelligence to make huge fortunes. In order to protect the huge amount of property obtained illegally, they sent "agents" to infiltrate the people's judicial organs. When their illegal acts of stealing state property were discovered and reported to the court, they instructed these agents to try their best to find ways to exonerate them and evade legal sanctions. For example, Li Rushan, the owner of the Beijing Huayang Construction Factory, contracted a project for the Electric Power Management Bureau and bribed the supervisor 5 million yuan, engaging in large-scale shoddy work and materials, causing state property losses equivalent to more than 80,000 catties of millet. The Beijing Municipal People's Court ordered him to pay full compensation and sentenced him to three years in prison. Li Rushan appealed to the Supreme People's Court and bribed Liu Yong, a clerk in the Criminal Trial Division of the Supreme People's Court. Liu Yong actively tried to get Li Rushan released on bail first, and then changed the sentence to only compensate the state for a loss of more than 30,000 catties of millet and changed the prison sentence to two years, suspended for three years. As a result, the state property lost more than 50,000 catties of millet, while Liu Yong received 12 million yuan in赃款 (ill-gotten gains) plus a pen. Another example is that the Tianjin Hengyu Cloth Shop embezzled gauze worth more than 400 million yuan stored by the traitor. The Tianjin Municipal People's Court ordered that all of it be handed over. Zeng Yuncheng, the owner of Hengyu Cloth Shop, appealed to the Supreme People's Court and bribed the clerk Liu Yong with 35 million yuan, as well as pens, wool fabrics, cigarettes, etc. Liu immediately inquired about trial information for him, offered advice, and bought off two employees and an accountant to provide false evidence. As a result, Hengyu Cloth Shop actually won the case. Take Gu Yushang, the major embezzler of the Supreme People's Court, as another example. He used his power to embezzle and pervert justice, and tried his best to exonerate the illegal capitalists from the crime of stealing state property, acquitting the guilty or giving lenient sentences for serious crimes. In the two cases he handled, the state property lost more than 300 million yuan.
    Among the current judicial personnel, a considerable number are "agents" who were sent in by the bourgeoisie through recommendation or examination; there are also some who are capitalists themselves. They go to work in the daytime to handle "official business," and return to their own shops at night to do business. They use the赃款 (ill-gotten gains) from corruption and selling the law to invest in shops, expand "operations," and make a fortune. At the same time, they use their positions in the people's judicial organs to protect their illegally obtained property.
    Some unreformed old judges and old lawyers were originally lackeys of the reactionary ruling class. After liberation, they became the most suitable and convenient targets for the bourgeoisie to seek agents. Many of these people wear the cloak of people's judicial cadres in the people's judicial organs, but in essence they are the bourgeoisie's "legal advisors" or "litigation agents." They act recklessly, distort policies, defend the bourgeoisie's illegal acts, and try their best to safeguard the interests of the bourgeoisie. For example, in the case of the North China Import and Export Branch suing the Minheng Trading Company for compensation for breach of contract for ordering麻袋 (gunny sacks), when the Supreme People's Court ruled that Sheng Xifu Hat Shop, the guarantor, should bear joint and several liability, Shi Jinghou, a clerk in the Civil Division of the court (old court personnel), clamored: "Letting Sheng Xifu go bankrupt is not in line with the policy of supporting industry and commerce." When the leaders of the Civil Division asked him to write the judgment according to the deliberation results, Shi deliberately delayed.
    What is even more serious is that the bourgeoisie uses all kinds of despicable and shameless means to corrupt the people's judicial cadres, drag those with weak wills into the water, rely on them as backers, so as to obtain protection and engage in illegal operations to make a fortune. For example, Ren Zijing, the former deputy judge of the Baotou Municipal People's Court in Suiyuan Province, was originally an old cadre from a Communist Party member and worker background. Because he coveted a life of enjoyment, he was spotted by Sheng Shangwen, an illegal capitalist (leather workshop owner) and counter-revolutionary. Sheng tried his best to attack Ren Zijing, first making him a pair of high-quality leather shoes, then sending money, and then instructing his young daughter-in-law to receive Ren Zijing to drink tea and smoke, and to develop a physical relationship with him, thus completely capturing Ren Zijing. When Wang, a worker in Sheng Shangwen's leather workshop, accused Sheng of owing him 100 silver yuan in wages and demanded payment, Ren Zijing "repaid his gratitude" and threatened the worker, saying: "You have no evidence, it is a false accusation; you are addicted to drugs, which is illegal." And he wanted to arrest the worker. The worker was forced to withdraw the lawsuit in court. Under Sheng Shangwen's enticement, Ren Zijing, under the guise of engaging in prison production, put the prison's cart with the organization's flag on it and lent it to Sheng Shangwen to sell drugs. Sheng Shangwen made a fortune, and Ren Zijing also received a huge amount of赃款 (ill-gotten gains). In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, Sheng was accused by the masses, and Ren Zijing betrayed the people and shielded the counter-revolutionaries. First, he suppressed the accusation against Sheng Shangwen and refused to handle it, then he found false evidence for Sheng and helped Sheng transfer property. Although Sheng was eventually executed due to great public outrage, it can be clearly seen from this fact how deliberately the bourgeoisie lured and corrupted the people's judicial cadres. Another example is Guan Dongping, a judge of the Harbin Municipal People's Court, who, due to the erosion of the bourgeoisie, became corrupted and degenerated, accepted huge bribes, and arbitrarily released two imprisoned奸商 (unscrupulous merchants) who had stolen state property.
    The bourgeoisie's attack on the people's judicial organs is organized and planned, and has even usurped the leadership of the people's judicial organs in some places. Taking the Fujian Provincial People's Court as an example, there are many old personnel in this court, and most of them are habitually corrupt. They have special "brokers" outside to solicit lawsuits, and there are two corrupt "offices" in the court, specializing in studying methods of blackmailing, extorting, and dividing赃款 (ill-gotten gains), and deciding the outcome of lawsuits based on the amount of bribery. Several important links in the court have become "tiger dens." Another example is that important departments such as the president's office, counseling office, and adjudication committee of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Court are controlled by elements who have served as pseudo-judges for many years. The person in charge of the president's office used to be the secretary-general and acting director of the pseudo-Ministry of Civil Affairs, but he often handled court affairs on his behalf, and actually became the president's agent; every judgment of the criminal and civil trial chambers must first be sent to the secretary of the adjudication committee for review, then sent to the counseling office for revision, and then sent to the president's office for signature and issuance. These bad elements took advantage of their positions to make trouble, so that policies were distorted and the court changed its nature.
    Due to the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on the people's judicial organs, the interests of the state and the people have been seriously harmed, the people's democratic dictatorship has been damaged, and the political prestige of the people's judicial organs among the people has suffered incalculable losses. Therefore, we must carry out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements to the end, thoroughly investigate the corrupt and pervert-the-law elements in the people's judicial organs, further purify the people's judicial organs, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and strengthen the people's state machinery, so as to ensure the smooth progress of the country's construction cause.

    资产阶级向人民司法机关的猖狂进攻
    李剑飞
    资产阶级自参加人民民主专政的国家政权那天起，由于他们损人利己、唯利是图、投机取巧的本性，就开始向国家财经机关和国营企业进攻。与此同时，他们也采用了极为恶毒的手段，向人民司法机关无孔不入地进行侵蚀，企图夺取领导权。目前正在进行着的“三反”、“五反”斗争，已初步揭露了资产阶级向人民司法机关猖狂进攻的严重性。
    三年来，资产阶级借行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报等违法手段，发了极大的横财。他们为了保护违法所得的巨额财产，就派遣“代理人”钻进人民司法机关。当他们盗窃国家财产的违法行为被发觉、被控告到法院时，他们就指使这些代理人千方百计地为他们设法开脱罪责，逃避法律制裁。如北京华洋营造厂老板李汝山，承包了电业管理总局的一项工程，就向监工员行贿五百万元，大肆偷工减料，使国家财产损失折合八万多斤小米。北京市人民法院判令如数赔偿，并处以三年徒刑。李汝山上诉到最高人民法院，贿赂了最高人民法院刑事审判庭一组书记员刘颙。刘颙就积极设法，先令李汝山取保回家，后又改判只令赔偿国家损失三万多斤小米，并改处徒刑二年，缓刑三年。结果国家财产损失了五万多斤小米，而刘颙分到赃款一千二百万元另钢笔一枝。又如天津恒裕布店曾侵吞汉奸所存的价值四亿元以上的纱布，天津市人民法院判令如数交出。恒裕布店老板曾云程上诉到最高人民法院，并贿赂了书记员刘颙三千五百万元，及钢笔、呢料、纸烟等物。刘即代为刺探审判情报，并为之出谋划策，收买了两个职员及一个会计师作反证，这样，恒裕布店竟获得了胜诉。再以最高人民法院的大贪污犯顾裕尚为例，他利用职权，贪赃枉法，竭力为违法资本家盗窃国家财产的罪恶行为开脱罪责，将有罪判无罪或重罪轻判，只顾犯经办的两案，即使国家财产损失三亿元以上。
    在现职司法人员中，有不小的一批是资产阶级用推荐或投考的方式打进来的“代理人”；也有一些人本身就是资本家。他们白天上班办“公”，夜晚就回到自己的商店作生意。他们用贪赃卖法得来的赃款，投入商店，扩大“经营”，发横财。同时，又利用他们在人民司法机关中混得的职位，保护他们违法取得的财产。
    有些未经改造的旧法官、旧律师，他们过去原是反动统治阶级的爪牙，解放后，又成为资产阶级物色代理人的最合适也是最便利的对象。这些人中的许多人，在人民司法机关中披着人民司法干部的外衣，实质上是资产阶级的“法律顾问”或“诉讼代理人”。他们胡作非为，并曲解政策，为资产阶级的违法行为作辩护，尽力维护资产阶级的利益。如华北进出口分公司控告民亨贸易行违反订购麻袋合同要求赔偿案，当最高人民法院判令担保者盛锡福帽庄负连带赔偿责任时，该院民庭书记员史靖侯
    （旧法院人员）即叫嚣：“让盛锡福赔光了，于扶植工商业政策不合。”民庭领导人要他按评议结果写判决时，史竟故意拖延不办。
    更严重的是，资产阶级采用种种卑劣无耻的手段，腐蚀人民司法干部，把那些意志不坚定的分子拖下水去，倚为靠山，以便取得保护，进行违法经营而大发横财。例如前绥远省包头市人民法院副审判长任子敬，原是共产党员、工人出身的老干部。由于贪图生活享受，被违法资本家（皮坊老板）、反革命分子盛尚文看中。盛犯就千方百计地向任子敬进攻，先是给他做了一双上等皮鞋，继则送钱，后又指使自己年青的儿媳妇接待任子敬喝茶吸烟，并使之和任子敬发生了肉体关系，就这样把任子敬伏伏贴贴地俘掳过去了。当盛尚文皮坊的工人王某控告盛犯欠工资一百银元要求偿付时，任子敬“感恩图报”，竟威胁工人说：“你无证据，是诬告；你吸毒，是犯法。”并要把这位工人押起来。这位工人被迫当庭撤销诉状。任子敬在盛尚文勾引下，又借搞监狱生产为名，把监狱的大车插上机关旗帜，借给盛尚文贩毒，盛尚文发了横财，任子敬也分得巨额赃款。在镇压反革命运动中盛犯被群众控告，任子敬竟背叛人民，包庇反革命分子。先是把告发盛尚文的状子压下不办，继又替盛犯找反证，并帮助盛犯转移财产。虽然盛犯因民愤极大终被处死，但从这一事实中，可以明显地看到资产阶级是如何处心积虑地勾引和腐蚀人民司法干部。又如哈尔滨市人民法院审判员关东平，由于受资产阶级的侵蚀，腐化堕落，接受巨额贿赂，擅将两个被押的盗窃国家财产的奸商放跑。
    资产阶级向人民司法机关的进攻是有组织有计划地进行的，甚至已经篡夺了某些地方人民司法机关的领导权。以福建省人民法院为例，这个法院旧人员很多，大部贪污成习，他们在外面有专门的“经纪人”包揽诉讼，在法院内有两个贪污“办公室”，专门研究敲诈、勒索、分赃的办法，并根据行贿的多少，来决定官司的胜负。该院的若干重要环节，已变成“老虎窝”。又如浙江省人民法院的院长办公室、辅导室、审判委员会等重要部门，都被曾任多年伪法官的分子所掌握。院长办公室的负责人曾任伪民政厅秘书长和代理厅长，院内事务却常由他代拆代行，实际上已成为院长的代理人；刑事和民事两审判庭的每一判决，都先送审判委员会秘书审核，再送辅导室修改，然后送院长办公室签发。这些坏分子则借职务的便利从中捣鬼，以致政策被歪曲，法庭变了质。
    由于资产阶级向人民司法机关的猖狂进攻，严重地危害了国家和人民的利益，损害了人民民主专政的政权，使人民司法机关在人民群众中的政治威信，遭受到无法估计的损失。因此，我们必须把
    “三反”、“五反”运动进行到底，把人民司法机关中的贪赃枉法的分子彻底清查出来，进一步纯洁人民司法机关，巩固人民民主专政，强化人民的国家机器，以保障国家建设事业的顺利进行。
