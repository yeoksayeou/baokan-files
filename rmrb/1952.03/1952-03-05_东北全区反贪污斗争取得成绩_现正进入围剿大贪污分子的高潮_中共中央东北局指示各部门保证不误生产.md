(Xinhua News Agency) The campaign to encircle and suppress major corruption offenders in the Northeast region is being vigorously carried out and has now entered a climax of wiping out major corrupt elements.

Since the large-scale launch of this struggle to encircle and suppress corruption offenders in all provinces and cities of Northeast China after January 10th, the plans have been revised twice. Up to now, great achievements have been made. Even in Rehe Province, which is generally considered relatively poor, many corrupt offenders, both large and small, have been investigated and exposed. In the struggle, the experience of capturing corruption offenders is becoming richer day by day. The "offensive and defensive alliance" between corruption offenders and illegal capitalists is being broken one by one, and many fortresses placed by the bourgeoisie within the revolutionary ranks have been uprooted.

At the beginning of the campaign to encircle and suppress major corruption offenders, Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, personally directed the work, strictly ordering Party committees at all levels to formulate plans within a limited time and report on achievements and experiences. However, at that time, some leading cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of the situation and had various erroneous ideas: for example, some heads of departments were blind to the major corruption offenders who were lurking around them, even considering them only "small mice" and letting them go lightly; some easily believed the confessions of corruption offenders, allowing many major corruption offenders to conceal their serious crimes; some, although possessing definite materials and reliable evidence, did not dare to treat them as major corruption offenders when the offenders refused to admit their guilt; some did not analyze or study materials, look for clues, or organize forces to attack, but waited for the major corruption offenders to confess voluntarily. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee strictly criticized and corrected these right-leaning ideas, expressing a firm attitude to eradicate evil completely, thus greatly increasing the vigilance of cadres and inspiring the fighting spirit of the masses. In addition, the announcement of the Beijing public trial gave the major corruption offenders two clear and different paths. Therefore, since mid-February, the achievements of the anti-corruption struggle have been increasing day by day, and many small and medium-sized corruption offenders, under relentless pursuit, have had nowhere to hide and have revealed their true colors as major corruption offenders.

However, after the in-depth development of the struggle to capture corruption offenders, the following three situations have emerged: (1) After each unit investigated and exposed a group of corruption offenders, some of the most stubborn and cunning major corruption offenders hid even deeper, making it more difficult to break through, thus often forming a stalemate. (2) Due to the strict supervision and urging of the higher authorities, some units that were not effective in capturing corruption offenders had the phenomenon of "completing tasks" or violating policies. (3) Some units hindered production and work in the anti-corruption struggle. These have now been resolved or are being resolved.

Shenyang City took the lead in breaking the stalemate and created the experience of conducting a joint campaign to encircle and suppress major corruption offenders in their lairs. In order to avoid delaying the construction season and to prevent capturing corruption offenders from affecting production, the city focused on capturing corruption offenders in the construction and industrial and commercial systems in February. The tax department adopted the method of "large meetings to explain policies and small meetings to fiercely encircle and suppress." After this method was promoted to various departments, it achieved significant results.

Regarding the phenomenon of some units falsely reporting achievements, "making up numbers," "handing in tasks," and violating policies, the Northeast Bureau, in addition to repeatedly pointing out that capturing corruption offenders should involve intelligence and strategy, emphasizing evidence, strengthening investigation and research, and earnestly mobilizing the masses, also specifically stipulated the standards for major corruption offenders. In this way, the goals of the struggle became clearer, and the focus of the struggle was completely concentrated on the major corruption offenders, thereby ensuring the correct conduct of the anti-corruption struggle.

Regarding the issue of combining the anti-corruption struggle with production, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has instructed all departments to assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for business work during the struggle to ensure the normal progress of production. At the same time, for units that have already cleared out a large number of corruption offenders, in addition to transferring necessary cadres to supplement them, it also instructed all business units to pay special attention to training activists in the struggle and to promote personnel who are honest and dedicated. In addition, due to the increased class consciousness of the masses, a competition between capturing corruption offenders and production has been launched in some industrial and mining enterprises. For example, the state-owned Rubber Factory No. 7, Shenyang Smelter, Machine Factory No. 3, and Factory No. 5 are all units that have captured major corruption offenders and completed or exceeded their production tasks on schedule.

Currently, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement within the organs of the Northeast region is closely cooperating with the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-embezzlement of state property, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement in the business community, fiercely launching an internal and external pincer attack on major corruption offenders and major thieves who devour state property.

### 东北全区反贪污斗争取得成绩  现正进入围剿大贪污分子的高潮  中共中央东北局指示各部门保证不误生产

    东北全区反贪污斗争取得成绩
    现正进入围剿大贪污分子的高潮
    中共中央东北局指示各部门保证不误生产
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：东北区围攻大贪污犯的斗争猛烈展开，目前已进入围剿大贪污分子的高潮。
    这一围攻贪污犯的斗争，自一月十日以后在东北全区各省、市大规模发动以来，曾经两次追订计划，到目前为止，已取得很大的成绩，即一般认为比较贫穷的热河省，也清查出了很多大小贪污犯。在斗争中，捕捉贪污犯的经验日益丰富，贪污犯和不法资本家之间的“攻守同盟”逐一被攻破，拔除了不少资产阶级安置在革命队伍内部的堡垒。
    围攻大贪污犯的斗争开始时，中共中央东北局书记高岗亲自指挥，严令各级党委限期制订计划，报告成绩和经验。但当时某些领导干部对于情况的严重性认识不足，存在着种种错误思想：如有的部门负责人，对大贪污犯在身边钻来钻去，还熟视无睹，甚至认为只是“小小的老鼠”，将它轻轻放过；有的人轻易相信贪污犯的坦白材料，使不少大贪污犯得以隐瞒自己重大的罪行；有的人虽掌握确实材料和可靠证据，但当贪污犯不肯承认时，就不敢当作大贪污犯来处理；有的人不去分析、研究材料，寻找线索，组织力量进攻，却等待着大贪污犯自动坦白。中共中央东北局严格地批评和纠正了这些右倾思想，表示了除恶务尽的坚决态度，因而大大地提高了干部的警惕，鼓舞了群众的斗志；加以北京公审大会的消息公布，又给大贪污犯指出了两条明显的不同出路。因此，从二月中旬以来，反贪污斗争的成绩与日俱增，不少中小贪污分子在穷追猛打之下，无处藏身，也都现出大贪污犯的原形。
    但捕捉贪污犯的斗争深入开展后，又出现了下述三种情况：（一）各单位清查出一批贪污犯后，有些最顽固、最狡猾的大贪污犯隐藏得更深，更不易于突破，因此，常常形成僵持的局面。（二）由于上级严令督促，某些捕捉贪污犯不力的单位便发生“凑任务”或违反政策的现象。（三）有些单位在反贪污斗争中妨碍了生产和工作。这些，现在已得到解决或正在解决。
    沈阳市首先打破僵持局面，创造了深入大贪污分子的巢穴进行会剿的经验。该市为了不误建筑施工时期和捕捉贪污犯不影响生产起见，在二月份有重点地捕捉修建部门和工商系统的贪污分子。税务部门采取了“大会交代政策，小会猛烈围攻”的方法。这一方法推广到各个部门后，获得显著成绩。
    对于某些单位虚报成绩、“凑数”、“交任务”以及违反政策的现象，东北局除反复指出捕捉贪污分子应斗智谋，重证据，加强调查研究，认真发动群众外，并具体地规定了大贪污犯的标准。这样，斗争目标更加明确，斗争的锋芒完全集中到大贪污分子身上，从而保证了反贪污斗争的正确进行。
    关于反贪污斗争结合生产的问题，中共中央东北局已指示各部门在斗争中，应指定专人负责掌管业务工作，保证生产正常进行。同时，对于已清理出一大批贪污分子的单位，除了抽调必要的干部加以补充以外，更指示各业务单位要特别注意在斗争中训练积极分子，注意提拔廉洁奉公的人员。此外，由于群众的阶级觉悟的提高，在某些工矿企业中已展开了捕捉贪污犯和生产的竞赛，如国营橡胶七厂、沈阳冶炼厂、机器三厂、五厂等单位，都是既捉到了大贪污犯，又按期完成或超额完成了生产任务。
    目前，东北区机关内部的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，正在密切地配合着工商界的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动，向吞噬国家财产的大贪污犯和大盗窃犯猛烈地进行内外夹攻。
