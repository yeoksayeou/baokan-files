Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 5th: The Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City People's Organizations comfort delegation to Kowloon City East Head Village disaster-stricken compatriots issued a statement on the 4th, protesting the bloody atrocities of the Hong Kong British military police in massacring patriotic compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon who were welcoming the comfort delegation. The statement is as follows:

"Entrusted by the people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, this delegation gathered at Guangzhou Railway Station at 7:00 AM on March 1st, preparing to depart for Hong Kong to offer condolences. Later, we received reliable reports that the Hong Kong British government had made various planned obstructions and sabotage arrangements in advance at the Tsim Sha Tsui Railway Station and the New Territories, attempting to unreasonably prevent the delegation from entering the country, and had pre-arranged another provocative conspiracy. For the sake of investigating the truth and exercising caution, the delegation temporarily announced a postponement of departure and immediately notified the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and relayed the message to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, and the preparatory committee of the Hong Kong and Kowloon All Circles Welcome Comfort Delegation. According to Hong Kong newspapers on March 2nd, the Hong Kong British government's Information Services Department announced at a press conference at 10:00 AM on the 1st, without any basis, that the delegation 'had arrived in Shenzhen on the evening of the 29th of last month' and stated that 'they will be refused entry.' In the afternoon of the same day, the massacre of our patriotic compatriots by the British police occurred. This fully proves that the Hong Kong British government's sabotage of the delegation's condolence work is a planned and pre-arranged conspiracy.

According to Hong Kong newspapers on the 2nd, when the news of the delegation's postponement of the trip to Hong Kong reached Tsim Sha Tsui Railway Station, the more than ten thousand people who came to welcome our comfort delegation immediately left the station in an orderly manner. However, on their way back, the British police brazenly and unreasonably rammed into them with police cars and dispatched a large number of fully armed military police to suppress them, throwing a large number of tear gas bombs and opening fire. Three of our compatriots were shot and injured on the spot, including Chen Dayi, who was shot several times and was in critical condition. In addition, many others were beaten and injured by British military police. Furthermore, more than one hundred people were unreasonably arrested.

We express our immense anger at this barbaric, shameless and bloody massacre by the Hong Kong British government and lodge a serious protest to the Hong Kong British government!

We solemnly declare: This delegation's visit to Hong Kong to comfort the disaster-stricken compatriots in East Head Village is a matter of course and is widely welcomed by compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The Hong Kong British government has no reason to refuse the delegation entry. Compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon have all patriotic freedoms and no persecution is allowed. We also issue a serious warning: If the Hong Kong British government attempts to use this provocative incident, which they planned and premeditated, to wantonly arrest and harm our patriotic compatriots, the Hong Kong British government will bear full responsibility for all consequences!"

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 5th: After the Hong Kong British government manufactured a massacre on the 1st and arrested a large number of our compatriots on the spot, it continued to unreasonably arrest our compatriots. It is known that Yangwu worker Fan Yan was illegally arrested at noon on the 3rd. In addition, carpenter Yan Lin was arrested at 10:00 AM on the 1st, and Wanbang Hotel worker Chen Weifen was arrested at 5:00 PM on the 1st and was beaten. According to reliable information, the Hong Kong British government is preparing to continue arresting our patriotic compatriots. During the massacre on the 1st, twenty-four of our compatriots who were illegally arrested have been illegally "tried," including three children: one twelve years old, one fifteen years old, and one sixteen years old. During the "trial," they alleged that they had been beaten by British police. Zhou Zhongjin said: They were beaten after being arrested and put into police cars, and one of them, named Zhou Qinyi, was severely injured. Dong Xiuye's left ear was bruised and black, and he had other injuries on his body. These twenty-four of our compatriots who were illegally arrested were forcibly charged by the Hong Kong British police authorities with "riots" and "inciting to undermine peace".

    广东省、广州市人民团体慰问九龙受灾同胞代表团
    抗议香港英国军警血腥屠杀暴行
    香港英国政府继续无理逮捕我国同胞
    【新华社广州五日电】广东省、广州市各人民团体慰问九龙城东头村受灾同胞代表团，在四日发表声明，抗议香港英国军警屠杀我港九各界欢迎慰问团的爱国同胞的血腥暴行。声明如下：
    “本团此次受广东省、广州市各界人民的委托，于三月一日晨七时齐集广州车站准备出发赴港慰问，后因获得确实报告：香港英政府事先已在尖沙咀车站及新界等地，作各种有计划的阻挠破坏布置，企图无理阻止本团入境，并已预先布置另一挑衅阴谋。本团为调查真相及慎重起见，临时宣布展期出发，并即以长途电话通知香港华商总会并转港九工会联合会，港九各界欢迎慰问团筹备委员会。据三月二日香港各报刊载：一日上午十时香港英政府新闻处即在记者招待会上，毫无根据地宣布本团‘于上月二十九日晚已抵达深圳’，并声言‘将被拒绝入境’。同日下午就发生了英国警察对我爱国同胞所进行的大屠杀事件。这就充分地证明了香港英政府破坏本团的慰问工作，实系一种有计划的、预先布置的阴谋。
    据香港各报二日报道，当本团展期赴港消息传至尖沙咀车站时，前往欢迎我慰问团的万余群众，当即有秩序地离开车站。可是在他们归途中，英国警察即以警车横蛮无理地向他们冲击，并调集大批全副武装军警到场镇压，投掷大量催泪弹和开枪射击。我国同胞当场中弹受伤者三人，其中陈达仪身中数弹，生命危殆。另有多人被英军警殴伤。此外，被无理拘捕者更达一百余人。
    我们对香港英政府的此种野蛮无耻的血腥屠杀暴行，表示无比的愤怒，并对香港英政府提出严重抗议！
    我们严正声明：本团此次赴港慰问东头村受灾同胞本属天经地义，并受港九同胞普遍欢迎，香港英政府绝无理由拒绝本团入境。港九同胞有一切爱国自由，绝不容许任何迫害。我们并严重提出警告：如香港英政府企图利用此次由他们有计划有预谋地布置的挑衅事件，而妄图滥捕加害我爱国同胞，一切后果将由香港英政府负其全责！”
    【新华社广州五日电】香港英国政府在一日制造屠杀暴行并当场大批逮捕我国同胞后，继续无理逮捕我国同胞。已知者有洋务工人范燕，在三日中午被非法逮捕。另有木匠严林在一日上午十时被捕，万邦酒店工人陈伟芬在一日下午五时被捕并遭殴伤。据确息，香港英国政府准备继续逮捕我爱国同胞。在一日屠杀暴行进行时，被非法捕去的我国同胞，已有二十四人被非法“审判”，其中有三个小孩子：一个十二岁，一个十五岁，一个十六岁。他们在“审判”中指控曾被英国警察殴打。周忠进说：他们被捕进警车后被殴，其中有一个叫周勤义的被打得重伤。董修业左耳被打伤呈瘀黑，身上还有伤痕。这二十四位被非法逮捕的我国同胞，被香港英国警察当局强加以“暴动”，“挑动破坏和平”的“罪名”。
