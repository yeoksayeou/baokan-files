    Xinhua News Agency, March 29th, Dispatch from TASS, Tokyo, March 29th: The Executive Committee of the Japan Peace Preservation Committee issued a statement protesting the use of bacteriological weapons by the US invading forces in Korea. The statement said: "The inhumanity of bacteriological weapons is no less than that of atomic bombs. The Warsaw World Peace Congress, representing the hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, demands the prohibition of atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and other weapons of mass slaughter of people. We call on all the Japanese people to support this demand."
    Xinhua News Agency, March 29th, Dispatch from TASS, Tokyo, March 28th: The Japanese Communist Party caucus organ "Kokkai Jiho" reported that at a meeting of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on March 20th, Communist Party member Hyakuro Hayashi questioned the Japanese government about the use of bacteriological weapons by the US military in Korea. He said: "According to foreign news, the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers has collected evidence of the US military using bacteriological weapons in Korea. Park Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has stated that Japanese war criminals Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano are cooperating with the US military in conducting bacteriological warfare. As early as February 1950, the Soviet government requested the extradition of former Kwantung Army war criminals, including Shiro Ishii. However, in violation of the decision of the Far Eastern Commission, these war criminals were not extradited, and no information was provided regarding what measures would be taken in this regard. At the same time, everyone knows that the former Kwantung Army conducted research in bacteriological warfare, resulting in the death or disability of tens of thousands of people. Everyone knows that the Geneva Protocol strictly prohibits bacteriological warfare and also prohibits the use of poison gas. What measures has the Japanese government taken regarding these war criminals, and how does it intend to control their activities?"
    Japanese Minister of State Katsuo Okazaki shamelessly replied to the questions, saying that the Japanese government "does not consider Shiro Ishii and those working in this area to be war criminals."

    日本拥护和平委员会执委会发表声明
    号召日本人民抗议侵朝美军进行细菌战
    日共议员就日细菌战犯参加美国细菌战争严厉质问日政府
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社东京二十九日讯：日本拥护和平委员会执行委员会发表声明，抗议美国侵朝军队使用细菌武器。声明说：“细菌武器的不人道并不下于原子弹。华沙世界和平大会代表全世界亿万爱好和平的人民，要求禁止原子武器、细菌武器及其他大规模屠杀人民的武器。我们号召日本全体人民支持这个要求。”
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社东京二十八日讯：日本国会共产党党团机关报“国会快报”报道，众议院外交委员会三月二十日开会时，共产党议员林百郎就美国军队在朝鲜使用细菌武器一事质问日本政府。他说：“据国外消息，国际民主法律工作者协会调查团已搜集到美军在朝鲜使用细菌武器的证据。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永曾经声明，日本战犯石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏正在与美军合作进行细菌战。早在一九五○年二月，苏联政府已要求引渡前关东军的战犯，其中就有石井四郎。但是，违反了远东委员会的决定，这些战犯没有被引渡，而且也没有提供关于这一方面要采取什么措施的情报。同时，大家知道，前关东军在细菌战方面曾经进行了研究，以致有成千成万的人民遭到死亡或残废。大家知道，日内瓦议定书严格禁止细菌战，也禁止使用毒气。日本政府对于这些战犯采取了什么措施，它打算如何管制他们的活动？”
    日本国务相冈崎胜男无耻地答复质问说，日本政府“并不认为石井四郎以及在这方面工作的人是战犯”。
