Secretary-General Lafferre's telegram to Guo Moruo, China Peace Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea, Beijing:

    We have received your telegram of March 10, 1952, and the protest from China's democratic parties against the U.S. military's insane use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

    We are forwarding this document to peace committees in various countries and asking them to tell us what measures they have taken to make the broad masses of people aware of these facts and to launch a worldwide condemnation. We support Chairman Joliot-Curie's statement condemning the use of bacteriological weapons and calling on public opinion to denounce this crime.

    Secretariat of the World Peace Council Lafferre
    Prague, 7:31 PM, March 12, 1952

Chairman Guo Moruo's reply telegram to Mr. Lafferre, World Peace Council, Prague:

    Chairman Joliot-Curie's statement condemning the United States' use of bacteriological weapons and calling on world public opinion to unanimously denounce it fully conforms to the wishes of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are extremely gratified and express their full support. The United States' mad crimes are increasing, and they recently dropped bacteriological bombs in Pyongyang. China's democratic parties and people's organizations have organized investigation teams to go to Northeast China and Korea to investigate, and details will continue to be reported.

    We are greatly encouraged that our democratic parties' joint protest has been forwarded to peace committees in various countries and that all suggestions have been adopted. The Chinese people deeply feel that with the unanimous condemnation of peace-loving and just people all over the world, we will certainly be able to stop the towering crimes of the United States and make the germ warfare criminals receive the most severe punishment they deserve.

    Guo Moruo, March 13
