    We Repelled the Attack of the Unscrupulous Merchant Feng Xijiu

    Editor: We are the workers of the Beijing Ziying Jiuji Automobile Company. Our capitalist, Feng Xijiu, served as the head of the Fengtai Material Depot during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and frequently stole materials from the warehouse. In the first year after liberation, he was placed under government supervision for a period. After the supervision was lifted, he continued to commit wrongdoing, violated laws, and oppressed workers. He used the automobile company as a front to hoard and speculate, buying and selling houses and cars in secret. The houses and cars he sold to the state were all made of substandard materials and inferior goods. He completely disregarded the workers' lives and even failed to settle their wages for one or two years. Some workers' families were unable to make ends meet and had to go outside to pick up coal. He shamelessly said, "The government is calling for increased production and thrift; you should eat cornbread and salted vegetables." After the anti-bribery movement unfolded vigorously throughout the city, he became panicked and restless day and night upon seeing the workers reporting him. He wanted to gauge the situation and called the workers together, saying, "Brothers, I have confessed all my problems. I'm afraid I've forgotten something. Please help me think about it." The workers ignored him. He said again, "Your wages will definitely be paid before the end of the year, even more than before." Everyone still ignored him. Later, the comrades from the inspection team explained the government's policy to us. Under the education of the inspection team and the trade union, we launched a face-to-face struggle against the unscrupulous merchant and exposed all his heinous crimes. His prestige ended under our powerful pressure.

    我们打退了奸商逢锡九的进攻
    编辑同志：我们是北京紫鹰九记汽车行的工人。我行资方逢锡九，在国民党反动统治时期，充任丰台材料库库长，经常盗窃仓库里的器材。解放后第一年，他被政府管制了一个时期；解除管制后，他依然为非作歹，违反法令，欺压工人。他以汽车行的招牌作掩护，暗地里囤积居奇，买卖房子和汽车。他卖给国家的房子和汽车，都用的是坏料和次货。他完全不管工人生活，甚至一、二年里都没有给工人算清工资。有的工人家属无法维持生活，只好到外边去捡煤。他还无耻地说：“政府号召增产节约，你们该吃窝窝头、老咸菜。”反行贿运动在全市轰轰烈烈展开后，他看见工人纷纷检举，就心慌意乱，昼夜不安。他想摸底，把工人召集来说：“弟兄们，我的问题都说了，我怕还有忘的，请大家替我想一想。”工人不理。他再说：“你们的工资在年底前一定发下，比以前还多点。”大家仍不理他。以后，检查组的同志向我们解释了政府的政策。在检查组和工会教育下，我们向奸商展开了面对面的斗争，检举了奸商各种丧尽天良的罪行。他的威风在我们的强大压力下宣告结束了。
