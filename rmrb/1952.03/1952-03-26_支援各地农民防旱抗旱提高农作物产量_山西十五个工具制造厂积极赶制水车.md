    Supporting Farmers in Various Regions to Prevent and Combat Drought and Increase Crop Yields
    Fifteen Tool Factories in Shanxi Actively Rush to Produce Waterwheels
    In order to support the drought prevention and combat and spring plowing production movement of farmers in various regions, the employees of public and private tool factories in Shanxi Province are actively rushing to produce a large number of waterwheels. The fifteen public and private tool factories in the province originally planned to complete more than 10,000 waterwheels from January to April. By the beginning of March, 8,000 units had already been completed, and more than 6,400 units had been transported to the countryside.
    In order to provide farmers with inexpensive, high-quality, and durable waterwheels as quickly as possible, the factory employees actively carried out production competition campaigns, striving to improve technology and overcome difficulties, so that the output and quality of waterwheels are increasing day by day, and costs are decreasing. In the red flag competition, the employees of the public Shanxi Machine Company made more than 20 major technological improvements, increasing the daily output from 100 units to 150 units, and the chain specifications were accurate to within one millimeter. During the anti-corruption struggle, the employees of the foundry department of this factory voluntarily selected two people out of ten to participate in "tiger fighting," while the remaining people guaranteed the completion of production tasks. When the supply of raw materials was difficult, the employees melted more than 600 kilograms of collected scrap iron into pig iron for use. The employees of the public Linfen Machinery Repair Factory improved more than 40 pieces of production tools. After the fitter Bai Aishao created a cap-twisting machine, the output of screws increased from 200 to 1,000 per day. Many workers in private factories also automatically supervised the capitalists to prevent them from cutting corners.
    With the development of the drought prevention and combat movement, farmers in various parts of Shanxi have successively requested to purchase additional waterwheels. Farmers in the Yuncheng area alone requested to purchase more than 7,000 units, accounting for 70% of the original order. Therefore, in addition to being determined to complete the annual production plan of more than 40,000 waterwheels ahead of schedule, the factory employees have also formulated a new production increase plan.

    支援各地农民防旱抗旱提高农作物产量
    山西十五个工具制造厂积极赶制水车
    山西省公营私营各工具制造厂职工，为了支援各地农民的防旱抗旱春耕生产运动，积极赶制大量水车。全省十五个公、私工具厂，原计划一月至四月完成一万多部水车，到三月上旬就已经完成八千部，并有六千四百多部已被运往农村。
    为尽快地供给农民价廉物美而耐用的水车，各厂职工积极开展生产竞赛运动，努力改进技术，克服困难，使水车产量质量日益提高，成本降低。公营山西机器公司职工在红旗竞赛中，有较大的技术上的改进二十多项，日产量由一百部提高到一百五十部，链子规格不差一公分。在反贪污斗争中，这个厂的铸工部的职工自动在十人中抽出二人参加“打虎”，其余的人保证完成生产任务；当原料供应困难时，职工便把收集来的六百多公斤废铁末化成生铁使用。公营临汾机械修造厂职工，改进生产工具四十多件。钳工白艾绍创造了绞帽机后，螺丝产量由每天二百个提高到一千个。许多私营工厂工人，也都自动监视资方，使不再发生偷工减料的现象。
    随着防旱抗旱运动的开展，山西各地农民纷纷要求添购水车。仅运城专区农民即要求添购七千多部，占原来定购的百分之七十。因此，各厂职工除决心提前完成全年生产四万余部水车的计划外，又订出了新的增产计划。（吴钢）
