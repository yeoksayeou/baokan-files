    “Teacher’s Monthly” Editorial Board’s Self-Criticism on Neglecting Politics
    Comrade Editor: Comrade Xia Jiang's criticism in the reader's letter column of the People's Daily on January 29th is correct. The main shortcomings of "Teacher's Monthly" are its weakness in political and ideological content, its lack of combativeness, and its insufficient guidance. Although these shortcomings were raised during the year-end summary last year, very little has been done to overcome them until now. The fact that the articles in the eleventh issue of "Teacher's Monthly" regarding the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement were so sparse illustrates this point. Although the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in Beijing schools had not yet begun when the last issue went to press, we did not earnestly strive to organize and guide the writing of articles on this struggle, thinking that if this issue missed the deadline, we could wait for the next one, and thus we only wrote a very weak short essay and published two articles on conservation. This fully demonstrates our insufficient understanding of the important significance of this great movement and shows that we do not pay enough attention to such a major political struggle currently underway in the country.
    Our publication has also not done enough work regarding the great Resist America, Aid Korea movement. We have not reflected the patriotic actions of Beijing educators in the great Resist America, Aid Korea patriotic movement. We have not mentioned a word about large-scale political movements such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and land reform. This is because we often thought that "Teacher's Monthly" is neither a general comprehensive publication nor an official publication of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education. If we also often publish articles of a political propaganda nature, wouldn't that be redundant with newspapers and other comprehensive publications! This understanding is obviously also wrong. This precisely shows that we have a purely business-oriented viewpoint that neglects politics. We will make our greatest efforts to correct this serious tendency to neglect politics.

### “教师月报”社对忽视政治的检讨

     “教师月报”社对忽视政治的检讨
    编辑同志：夏江同志在一月二十九日人民日报的读者来信栏中，对我们的批评是正确的。“教师月报”的主要缺点是政治性思想性贫弱，战斗性差，指导性不强。这些缺点在去年年终作总结时虽已提出，但直到现在还是克服的很少。第十一期“教师月报”关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的文章分量那样少，也正说明这一点。虽然在上一期刊物截稿时，北京市学校反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争还没有开始，但是我们并没有认真努力组织指导这个斗争的稿子，认为这一期赶不上就等下一期再说罢，因而只写了一篇十分无力的短论和发表了两篇有关节约的文章。这充分说明我们对这个伟大运动的重要意义是认识不足的，说明我们对国家当前这样重大的政治斗争是不够重视的。
    对于伟大的抗美援朝运动，我们刊物所做的工作也很不够。我们没有把北京市教育工作者在伟大的抗美援朝爱国主义运动中所表现的爱国行动反映出来。关于镇压反革命、土地改革等大规模的政治运动，我们是只字未提。这是因为我们常常以为“教师月报”既不是一般综合性的刊物，又不是北京市文教局的机关刊，如果也常登一些政治宣传性质的文章，岂不和报纸、其他综合性的刊物重复！这种认识显然也是错误的。这正说明我们存在着忽视政治的单纯业务的观点。我们将以最大的努力来纠正这种严重的忽视政治的错误倾向。
