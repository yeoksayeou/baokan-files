Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo dispatch, 19th: According to TASS, despite the Uruguayan authorities' unreasonable obstruction, peace fighters from North, Central, and South America held the Americas Peace Conference in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, from March 12th to 15th. The Uruguayan Ministry of Interior, under the direction of the U.S. State Department, had issued an order on the 11th prohibiting the Americas Peace Conference scheduled to be held that day at the "Defensa" Theater in Montevideo. However, this measure could not stop the determination of peace fighters from various American countries to fight for peace. Heads of delegations and most members still held the conference in private buildings.

More than 300 representatives of peace supporters from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, the United States, Paraguay, Venezuela, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Uruguay attended the conference. Many delegates overcame many difficulties to reach Montevideo.

The conference preparatory committee received hundreds of congratulatory telegrams from all over the world. Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, said in his congratulatory telegram on behalf of the World Peace Council that the resolutions of the Americas Peace Conference will mark a new milestone in the development of the peace movement in the Americas.

The conference discussed two issues: "The Threat of a Third World War Facing the Peoples of the Americas" and "The Struggle of the Peoples of the Americas for Peace."

Brazilian delegation leader Pareira Semberg gave a report on the first issue. He said that the people of the Americas, together with the people of the world, oppose the war policy. The frenzied war preparations and arms expansion movements have had a detrimental impact on American countries, including the United States. They have caused a decline in living standards and an increase in military budgets, and have allowed the United States to plunder the natural wealth and raw materials of Latin American countries.

Pareira Semberg emphasized the possibility of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and economic systems and the importance of concluding a Five-Power Peace Pact. He pointed out that the countries of the Americas had already collected more than 10 million signatures for a declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact. The people of the Americas demand a peaceful solution to international disputes. They demand an end to the Korean War, disarmament, and the prohibition of atomic bombs and all weapons of mass destruction.

Next, Argentine female writer Maria Luisa Oliver gave a report on the struggle of the peoples of the Americas for peace. She said that there is a strong feeling for peace among the peoples of the Americas. The current task of peace advocates is to turn this feeling into action.

After discussing these two reports, the delegations of peace advocates from various American countries attending the conference unanimously passed a number of resolutions.

On the 15th, a rally of 10,000 people was held in Montevideo to protest the Uruguayan government's obstruction of the Americas Peace Conference. The masses shouted slogans: "Defend peace! Down with war!"

    美洲和平大会在乌拉圭蒙得维的亚举行
    乌拉圭人民举行大集会抗议乌政府无理阻止大会的召开
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚讯：北美、中美和南美各国的和平战士不顾乌拉圭当局的无理阻挠，在三月十二日至十五日在乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚举行了美洲和平大会。乌拉圭内政部受美国国务院的指使，在十一日曾下令禁止预定当天在蒙得维的亚“第芬萨”剧院召开的美洲和平大会。但是，这种措施阻挠不了美洲各国和平战士为争取和平而斗争的决心，各国代表团团长和大多数团员们仍在私人建筑物内举行了大会。
    出席大会的有巴西、阿根廷、智利、美国、巴拉圭、委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、波多黎各、玻利维亚、危地马拉以及乌拉圭等国和平拥护者的代表三百余人。许多代表都是克服了许多困难才到达蒙得维的亚的。
    大会筹备委员会收到从世界各地发来的数百件贺电。世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在他代表世界和平理事会发来的贺电中说：美洲和平大会的决议，在美洲和平运动的发展中将标志着一个新的里程碑。
    会议讨论了两个问题：“美洲各国人民面临第三次世界大战的威胁”和“美洲各国人民为和平而斗争”。
    巴西代表团团长帕雷拉·森柏奥作了关于第一个问题的报告。他说：美洲人民和全世界人民一同反对战争政策。疯狂的战争准备和扩充军备运动给与包括美国在内的美洲各国以恶劣的影响。它们造成生活标准的降低和军事预算的增加，并使美国掠夺了拉丁美洲国家的天然财富和原料。
    帕雷拉·森柏奥强调具有不同的社会和经济制度的各国间和平共存的可能性与缔结五大国和平公约的重要性。他指出：美洲各国已经为要求缔结和平公约的宣言征集了一千多万人的签名。美洲的人民要求用和平方法解决国际间的争端。他们要求停止朝鲜战争、裁减军备、禁止原子弹和一切大规模屠杀人类的武器。
    接着，阿根廷女作家马丽亚·露莎·奥利佛作了关于美洲各国人民为和平而斗争的报告。她说：在美洲各国人民中间对和平有一种强烈的感情。和平拥护者们的当前任务，就是要把这种感情变成行动。
    在讨论了这两个报告以后，参加大会的美洲各国和平拥护者的代表团一致通过了决议案多起。
    十五日，蒙得维的亚举行了一万人的大集会，抗议乌拉圭政府阻止美洲和平大会的召开。群众高呼口号：“拥护和平！打倒战争！”
