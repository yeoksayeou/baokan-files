Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: The Soviet government's note to the U.S., British, and French governments regarding the issue of concluding a German peace treaty, as well as the draft principles for a German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union, align with the strong aspirations of peace-loving people worldwide, placing the United States and its British and French partners, who are determined to turn West Germany back into the core of military aggression in Europe, in a very difficult position.

According to news from U.S., British, and French news agencies, as of the 19th, the U.S., British, and French governments were still discussing a response to the Soviet note. Since the Soviet government presented the note on March 10th, the U.S. State Department, the foreign ministries in London and Paris, and the West German government in Bonn have been in turmoil. Anxious to unite Britain and France to seek countermeasures, the U.S. government hurriedly instructed its ambassador to Britain, Gifford, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli, to hold continuous consultations to study how to draft a response to the Soviet note and how the three countries should take "joint action" on this issue. According to a United Press International dispatch from London on the 13th, Gifford, Eden, and Massigli "have already agreed in preliminary talks that the Soviet proposals should not be easily rejected." According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Paris, as of the 17th, the three countries had not yet drafted an outline in their consultations and would hold further discussions this week in Paris with representatives of the three countries and the West German government.

The reason why the U.S., British, and French governments have been slow to respond is because they had decided in advance not to accept any such Soviet proposals, yet they fear that a simple rejection would expose their true attitude on the German issue in front of the people of the world and further isolate them politically. A United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 12th revealed that U.S. diplomatic officials privately admitted that the Soviet proposals "would be extremely appealing emotionally in Germany and have considerable appeal in France," therefore, "the Western countries must proceed with extreme caution" to avoid "political repercussions." Bartoli, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French Parliament, more frankly admitted in "Le Monde" that the Soviet proposals are deeply welcomed by the German people and "put the Allies (Western countries) in a difficult position." He said: rejecting the Soviet proposals "would put the Western countries in a dangerous position with regard to German and world opinion." The Dutch bourgeois newspaper "Nieuwe Haagse Courant" commented on the awkward situation of the Western countries, saying: "The Soviet proposals have presented the Western countries with a serious problem. It is very difficult to oppose these proposals... Many people in Western Europe believe that adopting the Soviet proposals can maintain peace."

What particularly unsettles the Western countries is that the Soviet Union's practical and clear proposals directly strike at the U.S.'s European war preparation plan centered on rearming West Germany. After the Soviet note was published, according to a United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 12th, officials at the U.S. State Department expressed concern about the impact of the Soviet proposals in West Germany, "which could make delicate negotiations on the inclusion of German troops in European defense (i.e., aggressive war preparation) more difficult." "The New York Herald Tribune" worried that if the Soviet proposals were accepted, the Western countries would "have to abandon one of the main sources of war production and troop manpower (referring to West Germany) on the European continent." This clearly directly contradicts U.S. policy. Therefore, the countermeasure discussed by the U.S., Britain, and France is to try their best to prevent the war preparation plan from being affected. The British Conservative Party's "The Observer" admitted on the 16th that the purpose of the three countries' discussion of how to respond to the Soviet proposals is "to prevent the work of rearming Germany from being delayed."

Currently, the U.S., Britain, and France are looking for excuses to continue to delay the resolution of the issue of unifying Germany and concluding a comprehensive peace treaty. But in doing so, they will inevitably once again expose themselves as the true responsible parties for continuing to divide Germany and creating a new war crisis in Europe.

    苏联关于对德缔和原则的建议深受欧洲各国人民欢迎
    美英法政府处境狼狈迟迟未能作复
    【新华社二十二日讯】苏联政府就缔结对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会以及苏联所提出的对德和约原则草案，符合全世界爱好和平人民的强烈愿望，使一心要把西德重新变成欧洲军事侵略势力核心的美国及其英法伙伴处境十分狼狈。
    据美、英、法等国通讯社的消息，截至十九日，美、英、法三国政府仍在讨论对苏联照会的复文。自苏联政府在三月十日提出照会以后，美国国务院、伦敦和巴黎的外交部以及西德波恩政府就乱作一团。亟图纠合英、法两国觅取对策的美国政府，慌忙指示其驻英大使吉福特和英国外交大臣艾登、法国驻英大使马西格里进行不断的会商，研究如何草拟对苏联照会的复文，以及三国如何在这个问题上采取“联合行动”的问题。据合众社伦敦十三日电透露，吉福特、艾登和马西格里“在初步会谈中业已协议：不应该轻易拒绝苏联的建议”。据法新社巴黎电透露，到十七日，三国在会商中还没草就纲要，本周还要在巴黎由三国及西德政府的代表再作讨论。
    美、英、法三国政府所以迟迟不能作出答复，是由于他们既然预先就决定了不接受苏联任何这类建议，又害怕简单的拒绝会在全世界人民面前暴露出他们在德国问题上的真正态度而在政治上更加陷于孤立。合众社十二日发自华盛顿的消息透露，美国的外交官员在私下承认：苏联的建议“在德国将极具感情上的吸引力，在法国也有相当程度的吸引力”，因此，“西方国家必须极为谨慎从事”，以避免“政治上的影响”。法国议会外交委员会主席巴托在“世界报”上更率直地承认苏联建议深受德国人民的欢迎并“使盟国（西方国家）处于困难的地位”。他说：拒绝苏联的建议“将使西方国家在德国和世界舆论方面处于危险的地位”。荷兰的资产阶级报纸“新海牙报”在评论西方国家的狼狈处境时说：“苏联的建议在西方国家面前提出了严重的问题。要反对这些建议是很困难的……西欧有许多人都认为，采纳苏联的建议可以维护和平。”
    特别使得西方国家不安的，是苏联的切实明了的建议直接打击了美国的以重新武装西德为中心的欧洲备战计划。苏联照会发表以后，据合众社华盛顿十二日消息透露，美国国务院的官员就表示担心苏联建议在西德所造成的影响，“可能使德军加入欧洲防御（按即侵略备战）的微妙谈判更多困难”。“纽约先驱论坛报”忧虑地认为，接受苏联的建议，西方国家就“必须放弃它们在欧洲大陆上的战争生产和军队兵员的主要来源之一（指西德）”。这显然与美国的政策直接矛盾。因此，美国和英法两国所讨论的对策就是要竭力不使备战计划受到影响。英国保守党的“观察家报”十六日承认，三国商议应付苏联建议的目的，就是“防止重新武装德国的工作被拖延”。
    目前，美国和英法两国正寻找藉口，继续拖延解决统一德国和缔结全面和约的问题。但是它们这样做，就无可避免地再一次暴露它们是继续分裂德国和在欧洲制造新战争危机的真正负责者。
