    A Terrible Account
    ——奸商 Colluding with Shanxi Province Cotton Yarn Company Cadres Causing Huge Losses to the State and People
    Ren Zhihao
    When we read in the newspapers or hear people say that corrupt elements and奸商s have stolen tens of thousands or hundreds of millions of yuan of state property, we are always very resentful and indignant. However, these figures are only a small part of the crime that is on the surface and easy to see through. An even greater and more serious crime is hidden and not immediately apparent, and that is the serious damage that corrupt officials and奸商s cause to our national economic construction and the people's lives. Now let's take an example to see:
    In June of last year, Huo Lingyun, the deputy head of the storage and transportation section of the Shanxi Provincial Cotton and Yarn Company, went to Shanghai and signed a contract with Zhou Mao Xing Machinery Factory for thirty "double-box top-force baling machines." The "double-box top-force baling machine" is a very small machine, and only thirty units were ordered. At the then market price, the pricing was not too expensive. However, due to the corruption and bribery of the corrupt element Huo Lingyun and the corner-cutting by the奸商 Zhou Xinglong, the harm to national construction and the people's lives reached an alarming level. Calculating the losses caused by such a small order in various aspects, it can be understood that the crimes of corrupt officials and奸商s are by no means limited to the small amount they directly steal.
    Huo Lingyun is a person of bad character and weak will, who cannot withstand the attacks of the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets." When he first discovered that there were many large sand holes on the large wheels in Shanghai, he questioned and protested to the奸商. However, when Zhou Xinglong, the manager of Zhou Mao Xing Machinery Factory and a big奸商, stuffed a roll of bills (400,000 yuan) into his pocket and bowed and scraped, saying, "This is a big machine, different from the parts on a clock. Our small factory has suffered a loss by taking on this batch of work. Mr. Huo, please forgive me," he fell silent. Later, Zhou Xinglong repeatedly delayed the delivery of the goods. Huo Lingyun threatened to sue the East China Military and Political Committee's Industrial Department, but after the奸商 stuffed another 500,000 yuan into his pocket, he "forgave" him. Later, every time he discovered a major case of shoddy workmanship, the奸商 bribed him again. When the machine was completed and shipped to Taiyuan, Zhou Xinglong was worried that the 100 million yuan deposit would not be received, so he gave the corrupt element Huo Lingyun a "big" benefit. He said: "Thank you for your visit, Mr. Huo. After the 100 million yuan outstanding payment is remitted from Taiyuan, I will give you another 10 million yuan as a 'reward.'" He then gave Huo Lingyun 500,000 yuan as "travel expenses." In total, the奸商 Zhou Xinglong gave Huo Lingyun 2.09 million yuan, plus the empty promise of 10 million yuan, which blocked Huo Lingyun's eyes and ears and bought his mouth to speak for the奸商 Zhou Xinglong. Therefore, when it was discovered during the installation of the machine that many wheels had no axles and there were no angle irons on the wooden boxes, he said that they were "lost in transit"; 30% of the parts were made of waste materials, and he said that they were "rusted in transit"; the gears ground into powder as soon as they turned, and many chains broke as soon as they were used (the contract stipulated that they would not break), and he said that the "packaging workers turned them too many times, and they were bound to break if they were tightened too much." It is already obvious that the service life of the machine will be shortened. According to experienced people, it can only be used for a maximum of three years, which is seven years shorter than the stipulated life. Even the 18-day delay in delivery caused a direct loss of 894.21 million yuan to the state. This is more than 400 times the amount embezzled by the corrupt element Huo Lingyun. Even if the 10 million yuan "reward" that he did not receive is added, it is still more than 70 times greater.
    The above is calculated based on the machine itself. Let's look at the losses caused to the state due to the reduced efficiency of the machine packaging. The contract stipulates that each bale of cotton should be packaged with 260 to 300 catties, but in reality, it averages less than 240 catties. If calculated according to the highest standard in the contract, each bale is short 60 catties, and if calculated according to the lowest standard, it is still short 20 catties. Now, let's calculate based on the most reasonable average figure of 280 catties and 40 bales packaged per day, and 1,600 catties of cotton are packaged less per day. From October of last year to January of this year, the Shanxi Cotton and Yarn Company packaged a total of 131,418 bales of cotton. Because the efficiency of the machine packaging was reduced, 5,256,720 catties of cotton were packaged less. This item alone will cost the state an additional 987.75 million yuan in packaging fees and packaging labor costs. From Jinan to Tianjin, 365 narrow-gauge train cars and 199 wide-gauge train cars were used, and the state paid an additional 1,096.04 million yuan in freight. In this way, in just three months, the state has already lost more than 2.08 billion yuan. This is only calculated based on three months. If this machine is used for three years, what a great loss it will cause to the state and the people! Dear readers! I think there is no need for me to calculate it. You can calculate it yourself. If it is "guaranteed for ten years" according to the contract, how much loss will it cause? You can also calculate it yourself!
    After such a calculation, some capitalists will definitely ask, "How can the accounts be calculated like this? It's unreasonable!" But, I'm sorry, this account can only be calculated like this, and it must be calculated like this! The contract stipulates that 260 to 300 catties of cotton should be packaged, but in reality, it averages less than 240 catties. Everyone understands the superficial truth that the less each bale is packaged, the more bales will be packaged, and the more packaging fees will be paid. It is also very obvious that 240 catties of cotton occupies the volume of 280 catties of cotton and takes up more space in the train car. Isn't it also a very obvious fact that one train car carries less cotton, and the number of train cars is increased, and more freight is paid? Moreover, the loss to the country caused by the increase in the number of cotton trains has not been calculated. This is not just a small amount of freight, but agricultural and local products that could have been exported are being stockpiled, preventing expanded reproduction, which will cause even greater losses to the entire national economy. This is a huge and irreparable loss! On the one hand, the cotton that the state has already purchased cannot be transported out, and a large amount of capital is being stockpiled; on the other hand, the cotton in the hands of farmers has no one to buy. A farmer would never have imagined that such a small order, and the small amount of money stolen by corrupt elements and奸商s, would affect the sales of their agricultural and local products. Now it can be understood. To sell surplus products and make life prosperous, we must wage a resolute struggle against corrupt elements and奸商s. We know that the Shanxi Provincial Native Products Company planned to export peach kernels, walnuts, red dates, persimmon cakes, hemp skins, and gypsum, etc. in December of last year, but they are still piled up at the station and in the warehouse and have not been shipped out. Funds are being stockpiled, and purchases have to be reduced or even stopped. As a result, the price of peach kernels has fallen from 5,500 yuan to 5,000 yuan, and the price of walnuts has also fallen from 2,500 yuan to 2,000 yuan. The impact of these two commodities on farmers' lives alone is very great. If calculated based on a farmer who produces 1,000 catties of walnuts per year, he is unknowingly looted of 500,000 yuan by corrupt elements and奸商s. If the losses suffered by every farmer in the province are added together, what a huge number it would be!

    一笔可怕的账
    ——奸商勾结山西省花纱布公司干部给国家人民造成的巨大损失
    任志浩
    当我们在报纸上看到或听人说到贪污分子和奸商盗窃了国家多少万元多少亿元的财产时，总是十分痛恨，愤愤不平。但是，这些数字只是摆在桌面上的，一眼就看透的一小部分罪恶。更大更严重的罪恶是隐蔽的，一眼看不出来的，这就是贪污犯和奸商对于我们国家经济建设和人民生活的严重破坏。现在我们就举一个例子来看看吧：
    去年六月，山西省花纱布公司储运科储运股副股长霍凌云，到上海和周茂兴机器厂订了一项三十台“双箱顶力打包机”的合同。“双箱顶力打包机”是一种很小的机器，也仅仅才三十台。按当时市价来说，定价也还不算太贵。可是，由于贪污分子霍凌云贪污受贿，奸商周兴隆从中偷工减料，国家建设和人民生活所受的危害却达到了惊人的地步。把这样一宗小的定货造成的各方面的损失计算一下，就可以明白，贪污犯和奸商的罪恶决不仅仅限于他们直接盗骗所得的那一点。
    霍凌云是一个品质恶劣、意志薄弱的分子，经不起资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的攻击。他在上海第一次发现大轮子上的砂眼很多很大时，曾向奸商提出质问和抗议。但是，当周茂兴机器厂经理大奸商周兴隆把一卷票子（四十万元）塞进他的口袋里，并哈腰打躬地说“这是大机器，和钟表上的零件不同。咱这小厂子，揽这批活就吃了亏，霍先生你多多原谅”时，他就不吭声了。之后，周兴隆一再延期不交定货，霍凌云闹着要往华东军政委员会工业部告状，但在奸商又塞到他腰包里五十万的一卷票子之后，他就“原谅”过去了。以后，每发现一处大的偷工减料，奸商就贿赂他一次。机器完工后起运太原时，周兴隆耽心一亿元的定款不能到手，因而又“大大”地给了贪污分子霍凌云一个“甜头”。他说：“多劳霍先生驾临光顾，太原汇来一亿元欠定款结账后，我再给你一千万元的‘好处’。”并随手给了霍凌云五十万元的“路费”。总共奸商周兴隆给了霍凌云二百零九万元，再加上那一千万元的空头黑钱，就堵死了霍凌云的眼睛和耳朵，收买了他的嘴巴为奸商周兴隆说话。因此，在安装机器中，发现不少轮子没有轴，木箱上没有三角铁时，他就说是“路途遗失”了；百分之三十的零件是废料新用，他说是“中途生锈”；齿轮一转动就磨出粉末，不少链条一用就断（合同规定保证不断），他说是“包装工人转圈多，拧得过紧必然要断”。机器使用年限要缩短，已经是很显然了。据有经验的人估计，最多只能用三年，比规定年限缩短了七年。连延缓交货日期十八天，给国家的直接损失就是八亿九千四百二十一万元。比贪污分子霍凌云贪污到手的大了四百多倍。就连未到手的一千万元的“好处”也加上，还大七十多倍。
    上面是就机器本身计算的。再请看由于机器包装效能减低给国家造成的损失吧。合同规定每包扎花二百六十斤至三百斤，实际上还平均不到二百四十斤。如果以合同的最高标准计算，每包就少扎六十斤，以最低标准计算也还少扎二十斤。现在我们以最合理的平均数字二百八十斤和每天包装四十包计算，每天就少扎一千六百斤棉花。从去年十月到今年一月三个月，山西花纱布公司共扎花十三万一千四百一十八包，因为机器包装效能减低就少扎了五百二十五万六千七百二十斤棉花。仅这一项，国家就要多付出扎包费和扎包工资费九亿八千七百七十五万元。由晋南运往天津多用了三百六十五个窄轨火车皮和一百九十九个宽轨火车皮，国家又多付出运费十亿九千六百零四万元。这样，在短短的三个月中，国家已经损失了二十亿八千多万元。这仅仅是就三个月计算。如果这机器用三年的话，要给国家和人民造成多么大的损失呢？亲爱的读者们！我想用不着我去计算了，你们可以自己计算出来的。如果按合同规定“保用十年”，又会造成多大损失，你们也可以自己计算出来的！
    这样一计算，有些资本家一定要问，“账怎么能这样算呢？不合理！”但是，对不起，这个账只能这样算，而且必须这样算！合同规定扎二百六十斤至三百斤棉花，实际上还平均不到二百四十斤。每包扎得少，就要多扎包，多出扎包费，这是谁也懂得的粗浅道理。二百四十斤棉花占了二百八十斤棉花的体积，装在火车皮里多占地方，这也是很明显的道理。一车皮少运了棉花，而增加车皮，多出运费，这不也是很明显的事实吗？而且，棉花车次运输的增加所招致的国家的损失，还没有计算在内。这不仅仅是少数的运费，而是本来可以出口的农产品和土产品被积压起来，不能扩大再生产，因而使整个国民经济会受到更为巨大的损失。这是一个大得无法计算和不可补偿的损失！一则是国家已经收购起来的棉花运输不出去，积压了大批资金；再则是农民手里的棉花无人收购。一个农民想也想不到，那么一宗小的定货，贪污分子和奸商盗窃的又只那么一点钱，会影响到他们农产品和土产品的推销。现在可以明白了。要想把剩余的产品卖出去，使生活宽裕，就必须对贪污分子和奸商进行坚决的斗争。我们知道山西省土产公司去年十二月份就计划出口的桃仁、核桃、红枣、柿饼、麻皮和石膏等等，直到现在还堆积在车站上和仓库里没有运出去。资金被积压了，不得不少收购甚至停购了。桃仁价格因此已由五千五百元降到五千元，核桃价格也由二千五百元降到二千元。仅这两种商品给农民生活的影响就很大。假如以年产千斤核桃的农户计算，则不知不觉地被贪污分子和奸商轻轻地掠夺了五十万元。把全省每个农民所受的损失加在一起的话，那又是多么大的数字啊！
