Economic Briefs

    ▲ Shaanxi Province is launching a province-wide drought prevention and resistance campaign. The Guanzhong region and the old revolutionary base areas in northern Shaanxi are the focal points of Shaanxi's drought prevention efforts. Both regions are vigorously mobilizing farmers to build farmland water conservancy projects to achieve the plan of expanding the irrigated area by 1,158,000 mu.
    Regarding the renovation of large canals: The 660-kilometer-long Weihui Canal main and branch canal project has been completed ahead of schedule. The newly built Luohui Canal is now under construction with its distribution and branch canals, in order to eliminate the blank areas within the irrigation zone and strive to release water on April 1st, irrigating 340,000 mu of farmland. The Qiuhui Canal in Weinan and the Juhui Canal in Hancheng County will be completed within the month. The Dinghui and Suihui Canals in northern Shaanxi will also start construction soon. After the thaw, the spring renovation projects of all canals in Shaanxi will generally commence. In addition, the thirteen canal administration bureaus across the province also plan to train 4,400 water management personnel this spring to establish and improve irrigation management organizations and promote a rational water use system.
    In addition, all parts of Shaanxi Province are paying special attention to extensively mobilizing the masses to build small-scale water conservancy projects.
    ▲ Spring plowing has already begun in Guangdong Province. Some rice paddies throughout the province are being plowed and harrowed, while others have already been planted with seedlings. Spring plowing and transplanting have already ended on Hainan Island, and the rice paddies have already begun intertillage (weeding). In the large-scale land reform movement, the production enthusiasm of Guangdong farmers is very high this year. They are confidently working to complete this year's task of increasing grain production by 1.3 billion jin.
    Farmers on Hainan Island are planting sugarcane and miscellaneous grains. In order to ensure the harvest, the fight against drought has been launched throughout the island. Yaxian County farmers have dug 560 wells, irrigating more than 1,300 mu of land.
    On March 8th, the Hainan People's Administrative Office issued an instruction to universally launch the drought prevention and resistance movement, calling on farmers throughout the island to carry out the fight against drought. In order to effectively lead this anti-drought struggle, the people's governments at all levels in the Hainan Administrative Region have established drought prevention and resistance offices.

    ▲陕西省防旱、抗旱工作正在全省展开。关中地区和陕北老区是陕西省防旱工作的重点，两区正大力发动农民兴修农田水利，实现扩大灌溉面积一百一十五万八千亩的计划。
    在大型渠道整修方面：六百六十多公里长的渭惠渠干支渠工程已提前修成。新修的洛惠渠，现在正在修斗渠和支渠，以求消灭灌溉区内的空白地带，争取在四月一日放水，浇灌三十四万亩农田。渭南的湭惠渠和韩城县的澽惠渠月内就可修成。陕北的定惠渠、绥惠渠也快开工。解冻后，陕西所有渠道的春修工程都将要普遍开工。此外，全省十三个渠道管理局还计划要在今春训练行水人员四千四百人，以便建立和健全灌溉管理机构和推行合理用水制度。
    此外，陕西省各地特别注重广泛地发动群众兴修小型水利工程。
    ▲广东省的春耕已经开始，全省的稻田有的在耕耙，有的已插秧。海南岛春耕插田都已结束，稻田已经开始中耕（耘田）了。在大规模土地改革运动中，今年广东农民的生产热情很高。他们正满怀信心地为完成今年增产十三亿斤粮食的任务而努力。
    海南岛农民正在种甘蔗和杂粮。为了保证收获，抗旱斗争已在全岛开展了。崖县农民已打成了五百六十眼井，使一千三百多亩田得到了灌溉。
    三月八日，海南人民行政公署已发出普遍展开防旱、抗旱运动的指示，号召全岛农民开展抗旱斗争。为了有力地领导这次抗旱斗争，海南行政区各级人民政府都已成立防旱抗旱办公室。
