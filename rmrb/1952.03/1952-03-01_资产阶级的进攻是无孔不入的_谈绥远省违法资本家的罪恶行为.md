The many corruption cases discovered in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are all related to the bourgeoisie who are heavily engaged in bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets. This has clarified a fundamental issue for us: the bourgeoisie is attacking us. The bourgeoisie and their spokespersons, when counterattacked, are not willing to admit their guilt, saying that the claim of a "bourgeois offensive" is "shooting at a phantom." However, the facts of the bourgeois offensive are so numerous that they cannot deceive anyone by trying to deny them outright. We can see the general picture from Suiyuan alone.

The spearhead of the bourgeois offensive is first directed at the staff of state organs. At a small-scale representative meeting of industry and commerce in Guisui City, capitalists confessed and exposed 384 illegal incidents, involving cadres from 75 units. Nearly ten thousand pieces of material confessed and reported by industry and commerce in Guisui and Baotou cities prove that they are accustomed to bribing cadres, evading taxes, stealing state assets, skimping on materials, and stealing state economic intelligence. The methods by which奸商 (treacherous merchants) attack state organ staff are roughly: ideological persuasion, lifestyle corruption, and infiltrating state organs. Ideological persuasion is necessarily accompanied by material enticement and lifestyle corruption. They are both soft and hard in their attacks. Zheng Chengcheng, a nineteen-year-old youth tax worker in Baotou City, wrote in his self-examination: "When I went to the Yihe Yong Grain Store to check taxes, they were very attentive and invited me to eat at the counter. The treacherous merchant said, 'You work hard all day and your meals are not good, it doesn't matter if you eat a little here. He also said, 'If you don't have any money to spend, take some from us.' In addition to bribes, they also introduced me to a wife." Manager Wu of the Minsheng Flour Mill said to cadre Wang Hantian, who was working there: "You work so hard and you are so thin, pay attention, it will be dangerous when you get to my age!" While capitalists were pulling cadres into the water, they desperately colluded with corrupt elements by deceptive methods, and sent "spies" to infiltrate state organs to carry out attacks. Jin Wanfa, a salesman at the Baotou Livestock Products Company, accepted gifts worth 70 million yuan from merchants, causing the state to lose 300 million yuan. Wang Yingxing, manager of the GuiSui FuheXing store, bribed cadres such as Bai Guangdou with 19 million yuan, evading taxes and stealing state property worth 300 million yuan. After the big奸商 (treacherous merchant) Lei Peisan stole the position of manager of the Baotou Livestock Products Company, he brought in five managers from old commercial firms. He alone established seventeen or eight accounts in the Guangheng West Fur Store, stealing state property worth 2 billion yuan in one year. Yang Yinghu, deputy manager of the Guangheng West Fur Store in Baotou City, consistently planned attacks on state organs. Last year, when purchasing 1.73 billion yuan worth of cashmere for the Zhangjiakou Trust Company, he delivered cashmere mixed with 50% sand as 75% pure cashmere. This one deal alone stole state property worth more than 570 million yuan. When the Guisui Flour Mill entrusted the Yiju and Xiesheng Grain Stores to purchase wheat, they colluded with cadres to mix in sand and soil, causing the Guisui Flour Mill to lose 900 million yuan in one year.

The bourgeoisie's offensive is all-pervasive. Zhang Zhongquan, manager of the Xinxing Construction Factory in Guisui City, deducted more than 51 million yuan from the wages of nearly 20,000 workers every day in contracting projects. Even worse, Xu Liang, manager of the Baotou Xinyisen, actually used drugs to pay workers' wages. What is the bourgeoisie like to the peasants? Listen to the confession of Chen Jinglu, manager of the Tianyuan Public Grain Store. He said: "In purchasing 17,600 shi of grain for the public, I mixed in 500 tons of bad wheat and stole 7,000 jin of public grain. I over-reported 6,000 jin in 580 shi of wheat. During the purchase period, I also lowered the price of grain for the peasants and bought 1,600 shi for my store." There are cases everywhere of capitalists lowering grain prices to抢购(rush to purchase) grain from farmers. Private merchants also used deceptive methods to acquire livestock and furs from Mongolian herdsmen, cruelly exploiting the herdsmen. Many city residents have also suffered from the害 (harm) of treacherous merchants. A private grain processing factory processed grain for the grain company and mixed 80 shi of naked oats and two carts of soil into 300 shi of wheat. Many people bought it back, and the oat flour was not like oat flour, and the bean flour was not like bean flour, and they could not eat it. Last year, Suiyuan Province suffered a disaster and became荒 (desolate).奸商 (treacherous merchants) in Guisui, Baotou and other places took the opportunity to囤积 (hoard) grain and raise grain prices, causing grain prices to rise several times a day. If the state had not allocated a large amount of grain, I don't know how many disaster victims would have starved to death! The奸商 (treacherous merchant) Wang Yingxing in Guisui made "毛咯噔" (coarse woolen fabric) for the People's Liberation Army, skimping on materials and stealing state property worth 38 million yuan in one go, causing the People's Liberation Army to wear clothes that could not keep warm. The Baotou Maosen Factory sold coffins to the rear hospital at a real price of 200,000 yuan, but issued receipts for 700,000 yuan. Some pharmacies bribed cadres, using bad medicine instead of good medicine, and made many patients worse. In short, the bourgeoisie attacked state organs, the People's Liberation Army, workers, peasants, herdsmen, city residents, students, disaster victims, patients, and even the dead, wherever there was profit to be made!

In the movement against corruption and bribery,奸商 (treacherous merchants) shamelessly organized "offensive and defensive alliances" to confront the state. A奸商 (treacherous merchant) in Fengzhen said to a corrupt element: "Friendship must be to the end, no one should say anything." A奸商 (treacherous merchant) in Guisui said to a corrupt element: "Bribery and acceptance of bribes are both crimes, it is good for both families not to say anything." The manager of a fur store in Baotou gave 1.5 million yuan to a tax bureau cadre named Li every month. After the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement began, he waited outside the Northwest Theater every day, instructing Li not to confess. As the movement deepened and the pressure from the masses increased, the "offensive and defensive alliances" were broken one by one, and the奸商 (treacherous merchants) put forward another slogan: "Rather die under the knife than die by talking." When the People's Government imposed severe legal sanctions on lawbreakers who had conclusive evidence, serious crimes, and showed no repentance, they resorted to means such as running away and assassination.

When the movement unfolded among workers and shop assistants, the capitalists became even more anxious. There were cases everywhere of intimidation and bribery of workers and shop assistants, mentioning "closing down" and "dismissing" at every turn. The manager of a fur store in Baotou threatened the workers: "Go ahead and make trouble! Wait until Chiang Kai-shek comes back to see!" Zhang Chengfu, manager of a tannery, threatened the workers: "Whoever runs to the trade union, I will break his back!" How much hatred they have for the people! In the Suiyuan Provincial Department Store, a traitor poisoned the food, and forty-eight people were poisoned. The奸商 (treacherous merchants) seized the opportunity to publicize: "Go ahead and make trouble, there is poisoning everywhere!" They wanted to intimidate people with this and prevent them from struggling. More often, they play tricks, falsely confess, and deliberately muddy the waters in a true-false-true manner, and finally kick it over and shirk responsibility. The people and the government have prevented this trick, and no matter how the奸商 (treacherous merchants) try to赖 (deny), it will not work. No matter what means they use, they cannot escape the palms of the people, and cannot escape the net of the people's law. Unless they truly confess and repent.

    资产阶级的进攻是无孔不入的
    ——谈绥远省违法资本家的罪恶行为
    绥远省人民政府副主席  杨植霖
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中所发现的许多贪污案件，都和大量行贿、偷漏税款和盗窃国家资财的资产阶级有关。这使我们弄清了一个本质问题：资产阶级在向我们进攻。遭到反击的资产阶级和他们的代言人并不甘心认罪，他们说：“资产阶级进攻”的说法是“无的放矢”。可是，资产阶级进攻的事实却是如此之多，他们要想矢口否认，能骗得了谁呢？我们只从绥远一地来看，就可见一般了。
    资产阶级进攻的矛头首先是指向国家机关的工作人员。归绥市一次小型工商界代表会上，资本家们就坦白、揭发了三百八十四件违法事件，其中牵涉到七十五个单位的干部。归绥、包头两市工商界坦白和被检举出来的近万件的材料，都证明他们是惯于向干部行贿、偷税漏税、盗骗国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报的。奸商们对国家机关工作人员进攻的办法大体是：思想劝诱，生活腐蚀，打入国家机关内部。思想劝诱必伴以物质引诱和生活腐蚀。他们在进攻时，是有软有硬的。包头市十九岁的青年税务工作人员郑成城在反省时写道：“我到义和永粮店查税时，他们很殷勤，并让到柜上吃饭。奸商说，你们整天辛苦，伙食又不好，在这儿吃点没有什么。又说，没花的，从咱们这里拿上。他们除贿赂外，还给我介绍爱人。”民生面粉厂的武经理对前往工作的干部王涵天说：“你工作这样卖力，身体那么瘦，注意点，到我这年纪就危险了！”资本家在拉干部下水的同时，拚命用欺骗方法和贪污分子勾结，派遣“坐探”，打入国家机关内部实行进攻。包头畜产公司营业员金万发，接受商人送礼七千万元，使国家损失三亿元。归绥复和兴货栈经理王映星向干部白光斗等行贿一千九百万元，偷漏税款、盗窃国家财产三亿元。大奸商雷沛三窃取包头畜产公司经理职位后，带进五个旧商号经理，仅他一人便在广恒西皮毛栈立了十七、八个户头，一年中盗窃国家财产达二十亿元。包头市广恒西皮毛栈副经理杨映湖，一贯主谋进攻国家机关，去年给张家口信托公司购买十七亿三千多万元的绒毛时，他竟把掺砂百分之五十的绒毛，当百分之七十五的净毛交货。只这一宗就窃取国家财产五亿七千多万元。归绥面粉厂委托义聚、协成二粮店代购小麦时，勾结干部掺砂掺土，使归绥面粉厂一年损失九亿元。
    资产阶级的进攻是无孔不入的。归绥市新兴营造厂经理张仲权，在包工中每天从近二万个工人中克扣工资五千一百多万元。更坏的是包头新义森经理许良，竟拿毒品给工人顶工资。资产阶级对农民是怎样的呢？请听天元公粮店经理陈景录的自供吧。他说：“我在为公家收购一万七千六百石粮食中掺了五百吨坏小麦，窃取公粮七千斤。在五百八十石小麦中多报了六千斤。收购期间还压低农民的粮食价格为本店买了一千六百石。”各地都有资本家压低粮价抢购农民粮食的事情。私商还用欺骗的办法收购蒙古牧民的牲畜、皮毛，残酷地剥削牧民。许多城市居民也受了奸商的害。某私营粮食加工厂给粮食公司加工，在三百石小麦中掺了八十石莜麦和两车土。许多人买回去，莜面不像莜面，豆面不像豆面，不能吃。去年绥远省受灾成荒，归绥、包头等地的奸商乘机囤积粮食，高抬粮价，使粮价一天数涨。若不是国家拨来大批粮食，灾民不知要饿死多少！归绥奸商王映星给解放军做“毛咯噔”，偷工减料，一次就盗窃国家财产三千八百万元，使解放军穿上不能取暖。包头茂森工厂卖给后方医院的棺材实价二十万元，却开了七十万元的单据。有些药铺向干部行贿，用坏药顶好药，把许多病人都治坏了。总之，资产阶级对国家机关、解放军、工人、农民、牧民、城市居民、学生、灾民、病人乃至死人，凡有利可图的地方都进攻了！
    在反贪污、反行贿运动中，奸商们又无耻地组织“攻守同盟”，和国家对抗。丰镇的一个奸商对贪污分子说：“交朋友要交到底，谁也不要说。”归绥的一个奸商对贪污分子说：“行贿受贿都有罪，不说两家好。”包头一个皮毛店的经理，每月给税务局干部李某一百五十万元。反贪污、反行贿运动开始以后，他每天在西北剧院门外等着，吩咐李某不要坦白。运动不断深入，群众的压力不断加强，“攻守同盟”一个个被攻破了，奸商们就提出另一个口号：“宁死刀下，不死话下。”及至人民政府对证据确实、罪大恶极、死不悔改的不法分子实行严厉的法律制裁，他们就使用起逃跑、暗害等手段来了。
    当运动在工人店员中展开以后，资本家更着急了。到处发现有威吓、收买工人店员的，动不动就提“歇业”、“解雇”。包头一个皮毛店的经理威吓工人说：“你们闹吧！蒋介石回来再看！”某制革店的经理张成富威吓工人说：“谁跑工会，砸断谁的腰！”他们对人民是多么仇恨！绥远省百货公司有奸徒放毒，四十八人吃饭中毒。奸商们便抓紧宣传：“闹吧，到处都有人放毒！”想以此威吓人们，不要斗争。更多的情形是耍滑头，假坦白，真一阵假一阵地故意搅混水，最后他来个一脚踢翻，推卸罪责。人民和政府已防住了这一手，奸商怎样撒赖也不行。无论他们使用什么手段，也逃不出人民的手掌，逃不出人民的法网。除非他们真正坦白，悔过自新。
