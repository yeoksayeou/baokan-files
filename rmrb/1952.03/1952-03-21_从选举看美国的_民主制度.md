    A Look at America's "Democratic System" Through Elections

    This year, November 4th marks the quadrennial U.S. election day. According to the U.S. Constitution, this year will see the re-election of the President and Vice President, who serve four-year terms, all members of the House of Representatives, who serve two-year terms, and one-third of the ninety-six Senators, who serve six-year terms. American political parties, mainly the dominant Democratic and Republican parties, have launched their campaigns. Americans have always boasted that this is one of the main manifestations of the American "democratic system." But what is it actually like?

    I. Undemocratic Electoral System

    The American electoral system is actually extremely undemocratic, with elections completely controlled by the Democratic and Republican parties, the two major monopoly capitalist parties. The undemocratic nature of the American electoral system is most evident in the various restrictions on the campaign activities of genuinely popular and democratic parties, as well as on the electoral rights of the people.

    According to the U.S. Constitution, presidential candidates must be nominated by political parties, and various restrictions are set by the states for the registration of new parties to run in elections. Some states even stipulate that only major parties can nominate. Therefore, in the vast majority of states, the people do not even have the opportunity to campaign, and in the very few other states, elections are effectively monopolized by the Democratic and Republican parties.

    The two parties each have their own complete set of machinery and methods for monopolizing elections. In thirty-two states, a handful of party bosses and their backers handpick the delegates to the national nominating conventions of the two parties. Voters have absolutely no say. In the other sixteen states, although there are so-called primaries, where delegates to the national nominating conventions are "elected," the selection of delegates and their choices in the nominations are still determined by a handful of politicians.

    At the national conventions of the two parties, after some infighting, the candidates for President and Vice President are decided, and then the delegates return to their respective states to decide on a list of "electors" for their party. In this way, the candidates for President and Vice President are effectively determined, leaving only the final contest between the two parties on election day. On that day, voters do not have the freedom to directly elect; their entire electoral right is simply to choose between the "electors" lists of the two parties.

    This system is a prominent example of the ruling bourgeois group's rape of public opinion, just as a British poet satirized the U.S. election in a poem: "No matter who I choose, I have to jump into that old boat."

    II. American-style "Democracy"

    Under the bourgeois regime, the American people are actually deprived of all electoral rights and freedoms. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that only citizens who are twenty-one years of age or older have the right to vote, which deprives nearly ten million young people between the ages of eighteen and twenty of their right to vote. In reality, even this is just a piece of paper. Many states have their own restrictions on voter qualifications, such as residency requirements, property, poll taxes, religious beliefs, educational levels, and so on, amounting to more than fifty different types. Some states, even without explicit legal restrictions, have various restrictions in practice, including intimidation, threats, and even barbaric means such as murder against voters.

    Under these circumstances, a large proportion of the American people have been unable to participate in elections in the past, so the actual proportion of voters who cast ballots is very low. For example, in the 1948 election, approximately 7.7 million people were deprived of their right to vote for failing to pay the poll tax, approximately 2.8 million people were deprived of their right to vote for not being able to write and speak fluent English, approximately 2 million people were deprived of their right to vote for not meeting the residency requirements, and approximately 3.5 million people were unable to participate in the election because they were traveling on election day. The number of people deprived of their right to vote under other pretexts is even impossible to count. In 1948, the U.S. population totaled more than 146 million people, and excluding minors and those deprived of citizenship, there were nearly 100 million voters. However, in the 1948 election, less than 50 million votes were cast in total, and everyone knows that this includes an uncountable number of "black votes."

    In racially discriminatory America, restrictions on the electoral rights and freedoms of black people are particularly strict. Black people account for ten percent of the total U.S. population, but among black people of voting age, only ten percent are registered to vote, and only one percent actually vote. Especially in the southern states, black people are subjected to open discrimination and persecution. They risk insults, beatings, and even murder to exercise their right to vote. During elections, it is common for black people to be killed for voting.

    The gangster-like interference with voters is one of the characteristics of "democracy" in American rogue society, and its targets are not limited to black people. During campaigns and elections, the party hacks and thugs hired by monopoly capitalists run rampant everywhere. A white reporter who witnessed an election in Kansas City once described the election situation in that city: "...Armed thugs with pistols, rifles, and clubs guarded the polling places in shifts. Four murders, a hundred armed assaults, and a hundred thousand illegal acts—this is the summary of one day of elections in this city." This is a vivid description of American "democracy."

    III. The Fraud of the "Two-Party System"

    The agents of American monopoly capital have always described the "two-party system" as a "sign" of American "democracy." They say that the Democratic and Republican parties, through voter voting, exchange governance and supervise each other, thus guaranteeing "democracy." In fact, since both major parties are parties of the big bourgeoisie and represent the interests of American monopoly capital, and since the entire electoral system is designed to ensure the rule of these two parties, the entire meaning of the "democracy" of the "two-party system" lies in covering up the reality of bourgeois dictatorship with a hypocritical "democratic" form, while arbitrarily restricting the independent political activities of the working class.

    The author of the famous book "The American Sixty Families" once specifically described the situation of American monopoly capitalists manipulating presidential candidates behind the scenes. The so-called competition between the "two parties" is nothing more than a reflection of the infighting between different monopoly capitalist groups. In fact, no matter which party comes to power, the bosses it serves are still the same people. The best proof of this is that the largest monopoly capitalist groups in the United States usually donate money to both sides.

    In the United States, campaigning costs a lot of money. In 1948, Truman's campaign spent more than 30 million U.S. dollars in disclosed campaign expenses, and countless more in secret. This money is provided by big capitalists. Billionaires like Morgan, Rockefeller, and DuPont are the real bosses of the Democratic and Republican parties. Under the guise of so-called "donations," these financial magnates secretly provide huge amounts of campaign funds for the two parties so that they can make a big splash, decorate "democracy," and deceive voters. They use the money they have obtained from exploiting the blood and sweat of the working people to create a murky atmosphere across the country through local party machines and rogue organizations, thousands of newspapers and hundreds of radio stations or television networks, and send their internally designated agents into the White House. Then they reap tens of billions of dollars in profits from the government's huge military budget and use the entire state apparatus to strengthen their rule and oppression of the people.

    Lenin, in analyzing the essence of the bourgeois dictatorship of the American "two-party system," pointed out sharply: "Since the emancipation of the black slaves, the differences between the two parties have become increasingly blurred. This struggle has no meaning for the people. The people are blinded by the symbols and empty duels of these two bourgeois parties and ignore their own vital interests. The so-called two-party system is one of the most ingenious methods of preventing the rise of a working-class party." This is even more true in the current United States. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 从选举看美国的“民主制度”

    从选举看美国的“民主制度”
    今年十一月四日，是美国四年一次的大选日。依照美国宪法，今年要改选任期四年的总统和副总统、任期两年的全体众议员和任期六年的九十六名参议员的三分之一。美国各政党，主要是占着统治地位的民主和共和两党，已展开竞选活动。美国人一向吹嘘说，这是美国“民主制度”的主要表现形式之一。但是，实际上是怎么样呢？
    一、不民主的选举制度
    美国的选举制度实际上是极不民主的，选举完全操纵在民主与共和两大垄断资本政党手中。美国选举制度的不民主，最显著地表现在对于真正人民的和民主政党的竞选活动以及人民选举权利的种种限制上。
    按照美国宪法，总统候选人必须由政党提名，而各州对新党登记竞选，订出了种种限制。有些州甚至规定，只有大党才能提名。因此，在极大部分州中，人民甚至没有进行竞选的机会，在另外的极少数州中，选举实际上也是由民主、共和两党所包办。
    两党各有其一整套垄断选举的机器和办法。在三十二个州中，一小撮党魁和他们的后台老板一手挑选出席两党全国提名大会的代表。选民根本无权过问。在另外十六个州中，虽然有所谓预选，由“选举”产生出席全国提名大会的代表，但代表的人选和他们在提名中的抉择仍是决定于一小撮政客。
    在两党的全国代表大会上，各派经过一番争夺，决定总统及副总统的候选人，然后代表们又回到各州去决定一个本党的“选举人”名单。这样，总统及副总统的人选就实际上已经确定，只剩下两党之间在大选日的最后一次争夺。在那一天，选民并没有直接选举的自由，他的全部选举权只是在两党的“选举人”名单之间作一抉择。
    这种制度是资产阶级统治集团强奸民意的突出的典型，就像英国一个诗人讽刺美国大选的一首诗中所说：“不管我选谁，我都得跳进那只老船里。”
    二、美国式的“民主”
    在资产阶级政权下，美国人民实际上被剥夺了一切选举权利和自由。美国宪法就规定，要年满二十一岁的公民才有选举权，这就剥夺了近千万十八岁到二十岁的青年的选举权。实际上，就连这一点也只是一纸空文。许多州对选民资格各自还规定有种种限制，例如居住年限、财产、人头税、宗教信仰、教育程度等等，不下五十余种。有些州纵然没有法律上明文的限制，但在实际上却有各种限制，包括对选民进行恐吓、威胁直到杀害等野蛮手段在内。
    在这种情形下，美国历次大选中都有很大一部人根本不能参加选举，因此实际投票的选民比例都很低。例如，在一九四八年大选时，约有七百七十万人由于没有缴纳选举税而被剥夺了选举权，约有二百八十万人由于不会写和说流利的英语而被剥夺了选举权，约有二百万人由于居住年限不够而被剥夺了选举权，约有三百五十万人由于选举那天正在途中而无法参加选举。在其他藉口下被剥夺了选举权者更是无法统计。在一九四八年，美国人口共计一亿四千六百余万人，除了未成年和若干丧失公民权的而外，选民人数近一亿人，而在一九四八年选举时，已投的选票总共不到五千万张，而且谁都知道，其中包括有数目无法统计的“黑票”。
    在种族歧视的美国，对黑人选举权利和自由的限制格外严格。黑人占美国总人口的百分之十，在到达选举年龄的黑人中，被列入选举名单的只有百分之十，而参加投票的更只有百分之一。特别是在南部各州，黑人受到公开的歧视和迫害。他们行使选举权要冒侮辱、痛打、甚至杀害的危险。在大选时，黑人因投票而被杀害已是常事。
    对于选民的强盗式的干涉是美国流氓社会的“民主”的特色之一，其对象并不仅限于黑人。在进行竞选和选举的时候，垄断资本家所雇用的党棍子和流氓们到处横行。一个曾目击堪萨斯城选举的白人记者曾描写该城选举情形说：“……武装的匪徒带着手枪、步枪和棍棒轮流把守着选举段。四次杀害、一百次武装进攻、十万次违法行为——这就是这个城市一天选举的总结。”这就是美国“民主”的活的描述。
    三、“两党制度”的骗局
    美国垄断资本的代理人一向把“两党制度”说成是美国“民主”的“标志”。他们说，民主、共和两党经由选民投票，交换执政、互相监督，这样就保障了“民主”。实际上，两大政党既然都是大资产阶级政党，都是代表美国垄断资本的利益，既然整个选举制度都无非保证这两党的执政，因此，“两党制度”的“民主”的全部意义也就在于以虚伪的
    “民主”形式掩盖资产阶级专政的实际，同时专横地限制工人阶级独立的政治活动。
    著名的“美国六十家”一书的作者曾具体地描述了美国垄断资本家在幕后操纵总统人选的情形。所谓“两党”的竞争，不过是各不同垄断资本集团之间钩心斗角的反映。事实上，任何一党上台，它所侍奉的老板仍是那些人。关于这一点，最好的证明就是：美国那些最大的垄断资本集团照例是两边出钱的。
    在美国，竞选要化费大量的金钱。一九四八年杜鲁门竞选，公开的竞选费就超过三千万美元，秘密的更不计其数。这些钱就是由大资本家供给的。像摩根、洛克斐勒、杜邦等这些亿万富翁们，是民主、共和两党的真正的老板。在所谓“捐助”的名义下，这些财阀们在暗中为两党供给巨量的竞选经费，以便它们大事吹打，装饰“民主”，迷惑选民。他们用这些剥削劳动人民血汗得来的钱，通过各地党机器和流氓组织、数千种报刊和几百个广播电台或电视网，在全国制造一片乌烟瘴气，把他们内定的代理人送进白宫。然后他们就从政府的庞大军事预算中捞回成百亿的利润，并且凭借全套国家机器来加强他们对人民的统治和压迫。
    列宁在分析美国“两党制度”的资产阶级专政的实质时曾尖锐地指出：“自从黑奴解放以来，两党的区别已日益模糊。这个斗争对于人民没有任何意义。人民被这两个资产阶级政党的象征与空虚的决斗所蒙蔽而忽视了自己的切身利益。所谓两党制度，是阻止工人阶级政党崛起的最巧妙方法之一。”这在现在的美国，更是千真万确。（新华社）
