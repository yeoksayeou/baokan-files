The working people of the German Democratic Republic, in response to the call of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to implement the plan for the national construction of Berlin, are actively undertaking the glorious task of rebuilding the capital.

    Model construction workers, engineers, and scientists have enthusiastically devoted themselves to this construction project. They are fully contributing their labor and experience. On the very first day of the reconstruction work, 45,000 people from all parts of the capital volunteered to participate. The First Secretary of the Berlin Party Organization of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Intlekofer, said in a speech before the start of the reconstruction work: "Better to sweat a thousand drops for peace than shed one drop of blood for war."

    Factories and enterprises in the German Democratic Republic are launching labor competitions to strive for overproduction of various materials and equipment for the reconstruction of the capital. Workers at the Radbruch glass factory have begun to produce an additional 10,000 square meters of window glass for Berlin; workers at the Karl Liebknecht machine factory in Magdeburg will supply Berlin with 1,000 tons of iron; and workers at the Potsdam railway repair shop have decided to work overtime to repair 180 freight cars for transporting building materials to Berlin.

    On the construction sites in Berlin, reconstruction work is proceeding intensely and joyfully every day; symphony orchestras and choirs appear from time to time on the construction sites to sing for the workers who are laboring to rebuild the capital. Berlin held a large-scale construction exhibition to introduce new working methods, new building materials, and new machines for reference.

    Berlin, through the creative efforts of the German working people, will be rebuilt from the ruins into a newly reborn peaceful city.

    民主德国人民重建柏林
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民，为响应德国统一社会党中央委员会关于实现国家建设柏林计划的号召，积极地担负起重建首都的光荣任务。
    模范建筑工人、工程师和科学家都踊跃地投入了这个建筑工程。他们充分地贡献出自己的劳动和经验。仅在重建工作开始的第一天，就有来自首都各部分的四万五千人自愿参加重建工作。德国统一社会党柏林党组织的第一书记英特莱茨基在重建工作开始前的演说中说：“宁可为和平淌一千滴汗，不愿为战争流一滴血。”
    德意志民主共和国的各工厂和各企业部门都在发动工作竞赛，争取超额生产重建首都的各种材料和用具。拉德堡的玻璃工厂的工人已开始为柏林额外生产一万平方公尺窗玻璃；马格德堡的卡尔·李卜克内西机器制造厂的工人将供给柏林一千吨铁；波茨坦的铁路修理工场的工人已决定加班工作，以修复一百八十辆运货车，作为运输建筑材料到柏林之用。
    在柏林的建筑现场上，重建工作每天都在紧张而愉快地进行着；交响乐队和歌唱团不时出现在建筑现场，为重建首都而劳动的工人们演唱。柏林举行了大规模的建筑展览会，介绍新的工作方法、新的建筑材料、新的机器等，以供参考。
    柏林，在德国劳动人民的创造性的努力下，将从废墟中重建成为一座新生的和平城市。
