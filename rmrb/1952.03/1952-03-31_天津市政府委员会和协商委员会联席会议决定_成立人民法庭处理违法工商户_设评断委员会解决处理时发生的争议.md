Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 30th: The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Committee and the People's Consultative Committee held a joint meeting on the 26th. The meeting heard a report by Zhang Fengshi, Secretary-General of the Municipal Economy and Inspection Committee, on the "Three-Anti" Movement, and a report by Committee Member Wu Yannong on the "Five-Anti" Movement. The meeting decided to resolutely carry out the movement to a complete victory with the spirit of "eliminating evil thoroughly." According to the order of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, the meeting decided to establish a Municipal People's Court under the leadership of the Municipal People's Government to handle illegal cases in the "Five-Anti" Movement; and approved the establishment of an Adjudication Committee by the Municipal Economy and Inspection Committee to resolve disputes arising from the handling of illegal events. In addition, the meeting also heard a report by Ma Like, Deputy Director of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, on the production and trade work since the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, and a report by Zhang Huayu, Director of the Municipal Construction Committee, on the construction workers' dormitories.

After discussion, the meeting unanimously agreed to the above four reports. During the discussion, Zhang Guofan and Bi Mingqi, members of the Municipal People's Government, and Tan Zhiqing, Yu Wen, Wang Guangying, Ye Pinzhi, and Zhu Jisheng, members of the Municipal People's Consultative Committee, spoke successively. They unanimously believed that the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements should be carried out thoroughly, ideological reform should be carried out in depth, and the achievements of the movement should be consolidated; illegal cases in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements should be handled in accordance with the methods promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, while normal production should be carried out.

Finally, Huang Jing, Mayor of Tianjin, made a concluding speech. He first pointed out that the purpose of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements was to achieve the following points: (1) to transform private industrial and commercial enterprises, (2) to transform state workers, (3) to establish a new atmosphere in society, and (4) to establish a sound system for the country. Then he analyzed and expounded on the following three issues.

Regarding the transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, Huang Jing pointed out that this is closely related to the entire social transformation work. The entire society is being transformed. If private industrial and commercial enterprises are not transformed, they cannot adapt to national construction. On the contrary, they will conflict with national construction and play a destructive role. The importance of transforming industrial and commercial enterprises has become very clear after this movement. What is incompatible with national construction is the five aspects opposed this time, such as bribery. These are all illegal behaviors. Facts have proved that these illegal behaviors are very common and serious. The total amount of tax evasion in the city accounts for about 30% of the city's national tax revenue, and the reduction of materials accounts for about 30%. The number of substandard materials in the construction industry is even as high as about 50%. From this, it can be seen how serious the destructive effect on national construction is. As for the loss of corrupting state workers and preventing the correct implementation of state policies and laws, it is even more serious. Therefore, private industrial and commercial enterprises must be transformed. However, the purpose of the transformation is not to eliminate private industrial and commercial enterprises, but to make them obey the state's policies and laws, abide by the Common Program, and become law-abiding industrial and commercial operators. At the same time, as long as private industrial and commercial enterprises engage in legitimate business within the scope prescribed by the state, they can fully develop. The normal development of private industrial and commercial enterprises is also needed by the state and the people. Precisely because of this, in this handling work, a lenient approach is adopted for industries and businesses that have a good effect on urban-rural exchanges, domestic and foreign exchanges, and urban supply. Therefore, people in the industrial and commercial circles should recognize this point. As long as the illegal behaviors are eliminated, normal development is entirely possible.

Secondly, Huang Jing pointed out that the importance of the leadership of the working class should be recognized in this movement. The most important reason for the continuous progress and transformation of society after liberation is the leadership of the working class. The working class is the most advanced force in society. The transformation of all classes and all major reforms in society can only be developed correctly under the leadership of the working class. This point is even clearer in this movement. When the "Five-Anti" Movement first started, it was led by the trade associations, and as a result, the movement could not be carried out. Only after workers and shop assistants were mobilized could the movement be promoted, the united front of the "Five-Anti" could be formed, and an in-depth struggle could be launched. In the future, to put private industrial and commercial enterprises on the normal track, it can only be achieved by strengthening the leadership of the working class.

Thirdly, Huang Jing pointed out that the issue of criticism and self-criticism should be correctly understood. In the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" Movements, many people tore apart their faces and launched face-to-face struggles, which seemed very "indecent" and "not friendly enough." However, we believe that friends should have right and wrong and principles, because unity is a unity with principles and right and wrong, and the standard of right and wrong truth is measured by the interests of the majority of the people. In the face of truth, we are not afraid of tearing apart our faces. As the saying goes: "A gentleman loves people with virtue." Cooperation between friends must have principles. If there are mistakes, we must struggle. The method of struggle is criticism and self-criticism. Isn't the confession and reporting in this movement criticism and self-criticism? Only those who are extremely serious in violating the law have been forced to adopt criminal punishment measures. This is an internal struggle and is completely different from the struggle against the enemy.

Huang Jing continued: The entire movement has now entered the handling phase. Most of those who have clarified the problems will be dealt with quickly and conclusions will be made. However, there are still some problems that have not been fully clarified. Therefore, on the one hand, we must carry out the handling work quickly, and on the other hand, we must continue to clarify those that have not been clarified. Therefore, we still have a lot of work to do, and confession and reporting must continue. Only by clarifying the problems can we carry out the handling, and we must never act hastily. After the handling work is completed, we should start construction work. In government agencies, we must adjust the organization, adjust cadres, strengthen political and ideological education, establish new systems, and establish a new style of work. There is more work to be done in the "Five-Anti" aspect, such as establishing new public-private relations and labor-capital relations. In short, we must eliminate the poison of the old society from ideology, style, organization, and system, and establish a new atmosphere.

In addition, Huang Jing suggested that the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the General Trade Union study and propose specific plans for the housing of construction workers in private enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 30th: The Tianjin Municipal Economy and Inspection Committee has established an Industrial and Commercial Household Illegal Event Adjudication Committee (this institution is also established simultaneously below the District Economy and Inspection Committee) in order to resolve disputes arising from the handling of illegal industrial and commercial households, with Wu Yannong (Secretary-General of the Municipal People's Government and member of the Municipal Economy and Inspection Committee) as Director, and Du Xinbo (Director of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce) and Zhu Jisheng (Deputy Director of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce) as Deputy Directors. The tasks of the Industrial and Commercial Household Illegal Event Adjudication Committee are:

1.  If a dispute arises in making a conclusion, or if one party disagrees and raises an objection after the conclusion is made, they can apply to the Economy and Inspection Committee to submit it to the Adjudication Committee for research and propose a solution.
2.  Study the relevant calculation issues in the illegal facts of industrial and commercial households. Those that need to be uniformly stipulated for the entire city shall be studied and proposed by the Municipal Adjudication Committee; individual issues shall be studied and resolved by the District Adjudication Committee.
3.  Study and provide technical materials needed for trials in the People's Court.

If one party disagrees with the adjudication made by the District Economy and Inspection Branch Adjudication Committee, they can apply to the Municipal Economy and Inspection Committee for re-adjudication.

The division of labor between the Municipal and District Adjudication Committees is: general disputes that do not have city-wide uniformity are adjudicated by the District Adjudication Committee; those that need to be resolved uniformly throughout the city are studied by the Municipal Adjudication Committee, and announced by the Municipal Economy and Inspection Committee, and the District Economy and Inspection Branch shall implement it accordingly.

The Adjudication Committee is a specialized committee under the Municipal and District Economy and Inspection Committees, and the members are appointed by the Economy and Inspection Committees. In order to study a specific issue, the Adjudication Committee may also establish temporary specialized organizations and appoint several experts to participate.

    天津市政府委员会和协商委员会联席会议决定
    成立人民法庭处理违法工商户
    设评断委员会解决处理时发生的争议
    【新华社天津三十日电】天津市人民政府委员会和各界人民协商委员会二十六日举行联席会议。会议听取了市节约检查委员会秘书长张逢时关于“三反”运动的报告及委员吴砚农关于“五反”运动的报告，决定坚决以“除恶务尽”的精神把运动进行到彻底胜利。会议根据中央人民政府政务院的命令，决定在市人民政府领导下，设立处理“五反”运动中违法案件的市人民法庭；并批准了市节约检查委员会为解决处理违法事件中的争议等而设立的评断委员会。此外，会议并听取了市工商局副局长马力克关于“三反”“五反”运动以来生产贸易工作情况的报告及市建设委员会主任张华戡关于建筑工人宿舍的报告。
    会议在进行讨论后，一致同意以上四个报告。讨论时，市人民政府委员张国藩、毕鸣岐，市各界人民协商委员谭志清、于文、王光英、叶聘之、朱继圣等先后发言。他们一致认为应该把“三反”和“五反”运动进行彻底，深入进行思想改造，巩固运动的成果；应按照中央人民政府政务院颁布的办法处理“三反”和“五反”运动中的违法案件，同时进行正常的生产。
    最后，天津市人民政府市长黄敬做总结发言。他首先指出这次“三反”“五反”的目的在于以下几点：（一）改造私营工商业，（二）改造国家工作人员，（三）在社会上树立新的风气，（四）建立国家的健全的制度。接着他就以下三个问题作了分析和阐述。
    关于改造私营工商业的问题，黄敬指出：这和整个社会改造工作是密切相联的。整个社会都在改造，如果私营工商业不进行改造，就不能和国家建设相适应，相反地要和国家建设相冲突，起破坏作用。工商业必须进行改造的重要性，经过这次运动，已经看得很清楚。它和国家建设不相适应的就是这次所反对的行贿等五方面。这都是属于违法的行为。事实证明，这些违法行为是非常普遍而严重的。全市偷税的数字约占全市的国家税收的百分之三十，偷工减料在百分之三十左右，营造业偷工减料的数字，更达百分之五十左右。从此可以看出对国家建设所起的破坏作用有多么严重。至于腐蚀国家工作人员，使国家政策法令不能正确执行的损失，就更严重了。所以私营工商业必须进行改造。但是改造的目的，并不是为了消灭私营工商业，而是使它服从国家的政策法令，遵守共同纲领，成为守法的工商业者。同时，私营工商业只要在国家规定的范围之内从事正当经营，是完全能够发展的。私营工商业的正常发展也是国家和人民所需要的。正因为这样，在这次处理工作上，对于工业以及对于城乡交流、内外交流、城市供应上有好的作用的商业，都采取从宽处理的精神。因此，工商界人士应当认清这一点，只要把违法行为去掉，正常的发展是完全可能的。
    其次，黄敬指出，应该在这次运动中认识工人阶级领导的重要性。解放后社会不断进步和改造，最主要的原因就是由于工人阶级的领导。工人阶级是社会中最先进的力量，各阶级的改造，社会上各种重大的改革，只有在工人阶级领导下，才有正确发展的可能。在这次运动中，就更看清了这一点。“五反”运动在刚开始时，由同业公会来领导，结果运动不得开展；而只有在发动工人和店员之后，才推动了运动，“五反”的统一战线才能结成，展开了深入的斗争。今后要使私营工商业走上正常轨道，也只有加强工人阶级领导才能做到。
    第三，黄敬指出应该正确认识批评与自我批评的问题。“三反”和“五反”运动中，许多人撕破了脸皮，展开了面对面的斗争，好像很不“体面”，“不够朋友”。但是，我们认为：朋友间应该是有是非、有原则的，因为团结是有原则、有是非的团结，而是非真理的标准是按大多数人民的利益来衡量的。在真理面前是不怕撕破脸皮的。古语说：
    “君子爱人以德”，朋友之间的合作要有原则，如果有错误，就必须要斗争。斗争的方法就是批评与自我批评。这次运动的坦白和检举不就是批评与自我批评吗？只有对违法极严重的人才不得已采取了刑事处分的办法。这是内部斗争，和对敌人的斗争是完全不同的。
    黄敬继指出：目前整个运动已进入处理阶段。大部分已经弄清问题的都将很快得到处理，作出结论。但也还有一些问题没有完全弄清。所以一方面要迅速进行处理工作，一方面没有弄清的还要继续弄清。因此，我们还有许多工作要做，坦白检举还要继续搞下去。只有把问题弄清，才能进行处理，决不能草率从事。处理工作完毕以后，即应着手进行建设工作。在政府机关方面，要调整机构、调整干部以及加强政治思想教育，建立新的制度、树立新的作风等。“五反”方面就有更多的工作要做。如建立新的公私关系，劳资关系等。总之，要从思想上、作风上、组织上、制度上，肃清旧社会的污毒，树立起新的风气来。
    此外，黄敬对私营企业建筑工人宿舍的问题，建议工商联及总工会研究提出具体方案。
    【新华社天津三十日电】天津市节约检查委员会为了解决处理违法工商户时发生的争议等，成立了工商户违法事件评断委员会（区节约检查委员会以下也同时成立这一机构），由吴砚农（市人民政府秘书长、市节约检查委员会委员）任主任，杜新波
    （市工商局局长）、朱继圣（市工商业联合会副主任委员）任副主任。工商户违法事件评断委员会任务是：
    1、在作结论中发生争议或作结论后一方不服事后提出异议，都可以申请节约检查委员会，交付评断委员会研究，提出解决方案。
    2、研究工商户违法事实中的有关计算问题。属于全市性须统一规定者，由市评断委员会研究后提出方案；属于个别问题者，由区评断委员会研究解决。
    3、研究并提供人民法庭审讯中所需要的技术性材料。
    区节约检查分会评断委员会所作评断，如一方不服可申请市节约检查委员会重新评断。
    市、区评断委员会的分工是：一般的争议事件而不带有全市统一性者，都由区评断委员会评断；凡须全市统一解决者，由市评断委员会研究后，由市节约检查委员会公布，区节约检查分会依照执行。
    评断委员会是市、区节约检查委员会下的专门委员会，委员都由节约检查委员会聘任。为研究某一专门问题，评断委员会并可设立临时专门组织，增聘若干专家参加。
