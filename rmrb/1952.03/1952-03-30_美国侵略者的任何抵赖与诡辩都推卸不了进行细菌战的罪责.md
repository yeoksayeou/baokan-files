No amount of denial and sophistry by the American aggressors can shirk their responsibility for waging bacteriological warfare.

Under the angry condemnation of people all over the world, the American aggressors, the bacteriological warfare criminals with heinous crimes, panicked. On the one hand, they continued to use clumsy lies for denial and slander, vainly attempting to shirk their guilt; on the other hand, they used various absurd arguments for sophistry, trying their best to prove that waging bacteriological warfare was not a crime. This extremely despicable, extremely clumsy, and extremely chaotic tactic of the American aggressors is precisely a manifestation of the guilty conscience of the American aggressors, and precisely further exposes the ferocious face of this murderer stained with blood in front of the people of the world.

In order to continue to deny its towering crime of waging bacteriological warfare, the United States Information Service, the official propaganda and intelligence agency of the United States, published a completely lying commentary on the 21st entitled "Today's World". This commentary tried its best to find two absurd but so weak reasons, trying to hide the fox's tail and decorate itself as an innocent lamb.

The first argument put forward by this commentary is: "Any country with the most basic humanitarianism would not be the first to use such weapons." Although the American aggressors here still do not have the courage to openly declare that they are a "country with the most basic humanitarianism", because they still fundamentally dare not criticize bacteriological weapons, they indeed want to imply that they are such a country. However, the people of the world know that the United States, controlled by the Wall Street financial groups, is by no means a "country with the most basic humanitarianism". The American aggressors not only actively prepared bacteriological weapons that violate humanitarianism, but also carried out planned bombing and strafing of undefended peaceful cities and villages in Korea, and carried out cruel massacres of unarmed Korean women, children, and the elderly; its invading troops in Korea arbitrarily raped women and looted property; it arbitrarily abused, insulted, and killed prisoners of war of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, and even conducted bacteriological experiments. Are all these countless crimes something that a "country with the most basic humanitarianism" could do? Facts prove that the American aggressors are just a group of the most brutal, the most barbaric, and the most shameless bandits.

The second argument put forward by this commentary is: "If the United Nations forces were to spread bacteria to the communist army, nothing could prevent these bacteria from spreading to their own troops." This sophistry is equally worthless. The fact is that in order to carry out bacteriological warfare, the American aggressors have already made various preparations on their own side. Many preventive inoculation certificates and confessions of many American and puppet troops captured recently on the Korean front prove that before carrying out bacteriological warfare, the American aggressors had first universally inoculated the invading troops with various vaccines such as plague, cholera, typhus, smallpox, tetanus, epidemic encephalitis B, and yellow fever. Everyone knows that plague has never occurred in Korean history, cholera has not been found in northern Korea since 1947, and yellow fever is a disease unique to the Americas and other tropical regions. The American aggressors' universal injection of these vaccines in advance in Korea is clear evidence that the American invading army is preparing to wage bacteriological warfare. Equally powerful proof is the fact that the American aggressors withdrew from the area where they were preparing to drop bacteria in advance. At 1:00 p.m. on February 11, three American planes dropped germ-carrying insects in an area 45 kilometers east-northeast of Kaesong and 15 kilometers northwest of Cheorwon. The American troops originally in that area had withdrawn on the evening of February 10. This is clearly not a coincidence, but a planned arrangement. The American aggressors thought that these preparations they had made were unknown to anyone, but it was precisely the soldiers in their army who were captured by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces who exposed their shameless conspiracy.

While pretending to be innocent lambs and categorically denying their crimes, the American aggressors are also showing their wolf teeth to bite people. The above-mentioned commentary by the United States Information Service repeatedly said that "influenza, pneumonia, measles, smallpox, scarlet fever, encephalitis, and other diseases are seriously prevalent in communist China", and that "the North Korean communist authorities have failed to take effective civil or military health measures" and other extremely clumsy lies. In order to prove the authenticity of the lies, it even invited a murderer, Sayms. The commentary said: "Last year, American medical expert Brigadier General Sayms led a four-person team behind the communist defense line to study the health situation there." The self-righteous American aggressors may think that others do not know Sayms's identity. However, everyone knows that Sayms is not only not a "medical expert", but also a criminal who holds the official title of Director of the "Health and Welfare Office", but is actually engaged in killing people and leading bacteriological warfare. American news agencies and magazines have constantly revealed that his bacterial landing craft No. 1091 used prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese side to conduct bacteriological experiments. He himself secretly sneaked into the rear of Korea in March of last year. According to the Associated Press at the time, he was there to collect "information on the plague" rather than "study the health situation there". What other meaning can there be for a big robber to bring a small minion to act as a witness, except to prove that this robber has committed numerous crimes and cannot find anyone to defend himself?

While carrying out denial and slander, the American aggressors are tightly grasping the
"International Committee of the Red Cross" as a "life-saving straw". The above-mentioned commentary by the United States Information Service once again said in a rogue tone: "Whether to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to go to North Korea depends entirely on the communists. Allowing an investigation, or withdrawing their accusations, also depends entirely on the communists." The obedient dogs of the so-called "Voice of the United Nations Forces" radio station in Tokyo and the British News Agency in London also barked incessantly. However, today's lies of the American aggressors and their accomplices are so despicable and so weak that they are merely repeating the completely exposed lies of yesterday and the day before yesterday. The American aggressors and their accomplices are only denying that they have waged bacteriological warfare, but they dare not condemn the use of bacteriological weapons, and dare not advocate the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. The American aggressors and their accomplices are constantly slandering the just accusations of the Chinese and Korean people against their bacteriological warfare as "monstrous lies", but they dare not even mention the facts that expose their deliberate preparations for bacteriological warfare. They repeatedly want the "fair and impartial" "International Committee of the Red Cross" to conduct investigations, but they dare not even say a word about the facts that expose the so-called "fair and impartial" face of the "International Committee of the Red Cross" that serves American imperialism, and even completely block the reporting of these facts, not even daring to reveal a single word. These iron facts have obviously poked at the sore spot of the American aggressors and their accomplices, just like the fear of a thief when he sees the captured stolen goods in court. How dare they mention it again? The cowardly and guilty state of the American aggressors has been exposed to the people of the world.

Because the evidence is so conclusive, the American aggressors themselves now seem to feel that all this sophistry, slander, and denial are ultimately useless. Therefore, they racked their brains to create various reasons to try to make people believe that waging bacteriological warfare is not a crime, and attempted to prepare public opinion in advance to exonerate themselves. For this purpose, they have fabricated three shameless and absurd arguments. But here, the American aggressors carelessly exposed the bloody face of their towering crime of waging bacteriological warfare.

The first absurd argument is: Bacteriological warfare is not illegal. The mouthpiece of the American war-mongers, "U.S. News & World Report," published an article on March 21 that frantically promoted bacteriological warfare. This article answered the question, "Is the U.S. Army actively experimenting with bacteriological warfare?" with an affirmative answer without any concealment, and admitted, "It has been doing so since the early days of World War II." The article also admitted that the American's "are able to do it" in "spreading diseased animals and insects from airplanes into wide areas -- as the Communists charge". This article devoted a great deal of space to shamelessly advocating bacteriological warfare, and finally it raised a question: "Is there any international agreement opposing the use of biological warfare, like an international agreement opposing the use of poison gas?" It shamelessly answered: "Apparently not." The American aggressors dare to obliterate well-known facts in broad daylight, which is a naked exposure of its shameless face. The fact is that both the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 stipulate the prohibition of the use of toxic weapons, and even the U.S. Department of the Army admits in the "Rules of Land Warfare" that this provision of the Hague Convention applies to the prohibition of the use of means to spread infectious diseases. The 1925 Geneva Protocol more clearly stipulates the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, and the United States was one of the signatories at the time. However, this shameless denial by the American aggressors precisely proves their own crimes, and ultimately exposes the fox's tail.

The second shameless and clumsy method of the American aggressors is: absurdly citing history, vainly attempting to use this to exonerate the crime of waging bacteriological warfare. The aforementioned "U.S. News & World Report" wrote in the same article:
	"Have there been actual instances in the past of using bacteriological warfare against people? Yes, there have been many times that it has been carried out to a limited extent. U.S. military officials believe that during World War II, the Japanese spread a small plague among Chinese troops. In World War I, the Germans infected some Allied horses with viruses, hoping that the disease would spread to the troops. Hundreds of years ago, when the British troops withdrew, they left behind clothes contaminated with plague bacteria. The advancing French troops contracted plague after seizing and wearing these clothes, and thus suffered a defeat. Going further back, Roman troops loaded the corpses of the dead onto catapults and shot them into besieged cities, causing a serious plague, which made it easier to occupy the cities." This clumsy method is precisely an unsolicited confession of the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare! It is trying its best to prove now that it is not the originator of bacteriological warfare, but that there are precedents to follow, thinking that history can help it reduce and absolve its own guilt in the future. However, the people who create history have never let go of any executioner in history who dared to massacre the people. It is futile for American war criminals to try to find their ancestors in Roman times. You should better look at the history that is close at hand and see the fate of those who were tried in the Nuremberg Tribunal and the Khabarovsk Tribunal. The American aggressors' wild ravings clearly cannot exonerate them from their crimes. On the contrary, they are powerful evidence in the future trial of these criminals.

The American aggressors also have a magic weapon: playing hooligan and rogue. The "New York Times" on March 16, in the "Science Overview" column, while trying its best to deny its crime of waging bacteriological warfare, also left a way out and spread lies in an extremely shameless manner, saying: "China is full of rats and fleas carrying germs, and a few more will not turn the unique diseases there into epidemics." The American aggressors' self-righteous idea is: in case they can't deny it, they can still forcefully put on a hooligan pose and use a rogue tone to deny the crime to the death, saying: I did drop the bacteria, but since you already have bacteria there, it doesn't matter if I drop some more. Is this still the language of civilized humans? No! This is the logic of robbers! The hiss of demons! As for the lies fabricated by the American aggressors themselves, they are even more unworthy of a smile. Everyone knows that American and British imperialism are extremely hateful and helpless towards the great People's Republic of China. They have to resort to the most ignorant curses, slanders, and rumors in an attempt to slander our country. As early as July 10, 1950, the British imperialist Hong Kong government spread rumors and announced that Xiamen was a plague port. In March 1951, the World Health Organization, controlled by American imperialism, shamelessly spread rumors and announced that all coastal ports in our country were epidemic ports in order to implement the US blockade of our country. In fact, China is neither "full of rats and fleas carrying germs" nor does it have any "unique diseases." Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, all epidemic infectious diseases have long been controlled. In Korea, as previously pointed out, there has never been plague in history. Cholera has been extinct in northern Korea since 1947. If rats and fleas carrying germs suddenly appear today, there can be no other reason than that they were dropped by the American aggressors. The American aggressors' attempt to play hooligan and rogue with this stupid lie and the logic of robbers just exposes the hideous face of this ferocious murderer who uses bacteriological weapons to massacre the Korean and Chinese people.

From the fact that the American aggressors only fabricate some clumsy rumors and slanders and dare not mention any facts exposing their crimes, from the fact that Acheson only categorically denies it and does not dare to condemn bacteriological warfare as illegal and inhumane, from the absurd sophistry made by American propaganda tools, people can see the American aggressors' cowardly and guilty state of embarrassment everywhere. All these shameless denials, slanders, and sophistry not only cannot exonerate the American aggressors from the serious crime of waging bacteriological warfare, but are also powerful negative evidence of the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare. The American aggressors cannot escape the serious responsibility for their bacteriological warfare in any way, and they will eventually be subjected to the most severe just sanctions by the people of the world!

    美国侵略者的任何抵赖与诡辩都推卸不了进行细菌战的罪责
    在全世界人民的愤怒声讨下，罪恶滔天的细菌战罪犯——美国侵略者慌了手脚。它一方面继续以拙劣的谎话进行狡赖和污蔑，妄想推卸罪责；另一方面，又以各种荒谬的根据进行诡辩，竭力想证明进行细菌战并不是什么罪恶。美国侵略者这种极度卑鄙、极度拙劣、极度混乱的作法，恰恰是美国侵略者作贼心虚的表现，恰恰在全世界人民面前进一步暴露了这个杀人犯的溅满了鲜血的狰狞面目。
    为了企图继续抵赖它进行细菌战的滔天罪行，美国官方宣传机关兼情报机关的美国新闻处，在二十一日发表了一篇以所谓“今日世界”为题的彻头彻尾撒谎的评论。这篇评论费尽心计找出了两个荒谬的但又如此无力的根据，企图藏起狐狸尾巴，把自己装饰成无罪的羔羊。
    这篇评论提出的第一个论据是：“凡是有最起码的人道主义的国家都不会首先使用这种武器”。美国侵略者虽然在这里也还没有胆量公开宣称自己就是“有最起码的人道主义的国家”，因为它仍然根本不敢斥责一下细菌武器。可是它的确想暗示自己就是这样的国家。但是，全世界人民都知道，由华尔街财阀集团所控制的美国，决不是什么具“有最起码的人道主义国家”。美国侵略者不但积极准备了违背人道主义的细菌武器，它还在朝鲜对不设防的和平城市和乡村进行了有计划的轰炸扫射，对手无寸铁的朝鲜妇孺老弱进行了残酷的大屠杀；它的侵略军队在朝鲜任意强奸妇女、劫掠财物；它对朝中人民军队的被俘人员任意虐待、侮辱、残杀以至进行细菌试验。所有这一切罄竹难书的罪行，难道是一个“具有最起码的人道主义的国家”所能做出来的吗？事实证明美国侵略者只是一帮最残暴、最野蛮、最无耻的匪徒。
    这篇评论提出的第二个论据是：“假如联合国军要向共军撒布细菌的话，没有什么东西能够防止这些细菌传布到他们自己的军队中。”这种诡辩同样不值一驳。事实是：为了进行细菌战，美国侵略者在自己这方面早已作了种种准备。最近在朝鲜前线俘获的许多美军和附庸军所带的预防注射证和他们的供词证明，美国侵略者在进行细菌战前，曾先在侵略军中普遍注射了鼠疫、霍乱、斑疹伤寒、天花、破伤风、流行性乙型脑炎、黄热病等各种疫苗。谁都知道：朝鲜在历史上从来不曾发生过鼠疫，朝鲜北部从一九四七年以来就不曾发现过霍乱病，而黄热病更是美洲和其他热带地区才有的病。在朝鲜的美国侵略军事先普遍地注射这些疫苗，正是美国侵略军准备进行细菌战的明证。同样有力的证明是：美国侵略军事先撤离它准备投掷细菌的地区的事实。二月十一日下午一时，美机三架在开城东北偏东四十五公里、铁原西北十五公里的地区撒下带有细菌的毒虫。而原在该地区的美国军队在二月十日晚上就撤退了。这显然不是什么偶然的巧合，而是有计划的布置。美国侵略者以为他干下的这些准备工作是神不知鬼不觉的，可是正就是做了中朝人民部队的俘虏的它的军队里的士兵揭穿了它的无耻阴谋。
    美国侵略者一方面装作无罪的羔羊，矢口抵赖自己的罪行，一方面又露出狼牙来咬人。上述美国新闻处的评论重复说什么“流行性感冒、肺炎、麻疹、天花、猩红热、脑炎及其他疾病在共产党中国严重流行”，什么“北朝鲜共产党当局未能采取有效的民政或军事卫生措施”等拙劣已极的谎话。为了证明谎话的真实性，它竟然请来了一个杀人犯赛姆斯。这篇评论说：“去年，美国医学专家赛姆斯准将曾率领四人小组在共产党防线后方研究那里的卫生情况。”自作聪明的美国侵略者也许以为别人不知道赛姆斯的身份。可是，谁都知道：赛姆斯不但不是什么“医学专家”，而是挂着“卫生福利处”处长官衔，实际上是以杀人为业，领导细菌战的罪犯。美国通讯社、杂志曾不断透露：他指挥下的一零九一号细菌登陆艇用朝中方面被俘人员作细菌试验。他本人曾在去年三月秘密潜入朝鲜后方，据美联社当时透露：是去搜集“瘟疫的情报”，而不是“研究那里的卫生情况”的。大强盗把小喽啰找来当证人，除了证明这个强盗罪行累累，找不到任何可以替自己辩护的人而外，还能有什么别的意义吗？
    美国侵略者一面进行狡赖、诬蔑，一面死死抓住
    “红十字国际委员会”这根“救命草”。上述美国新闻处的评论再一次以无赖的口吻说：“是否准许红十字国际委员会到北朝鲜去，这全要看共产党了。准许进行调查，不然就撤回他们的指责，这也全看共产党了。”东京的所谓“联合国军之音”的广播电台，伦敦英国新闻处的驯从的哈叭狗，也都跟着狂吠不休。可是，美国侵略者及其帮凶们今天的这类谎话，是如此卑鄙而又如此软弱，只是喋喋不休地重复着已被完全揭穿了的昨天和前天的谎话。美国侵略者及其帮凶只是一味抵赖曾经进行了细菌战，可是，却不敢斥责使用细菌武器，不敢主张禁止细菌武器。美国侵略者及其帮凶一刻不停地诬蔑朝中人民对其进行细菌战的正义控诉是“弥天大谎”，可是，对于那些揭露它们处心积虑准备进行细菌战的事实，却提也不敢提到，它们口口声声要让什么“公正无私”的“红十字国际委员会”进行调查，可是，对于那些揭穿了“红十字国际委员会”的为美帝国主义服务的所谓“公正无私”面目的事实不但连一句话都不敢讲，甚至将这些事实的报道完全加以封锁，连一个字都不敢透露。这些铁的事实显然已戳到了美国侵略者及其帮凶们的痛处，就像一个窃盗在法庭上看到了被捕获的赃物时那种恐惧一样，怎么敢再提到它呢？美国侵略者贼胆心虚的窘态已在全世界人民面前暴露无遗。
    由于罪证是如此确凿，美国侵略者现在自己也似乎感到这一切狡辩、诬蔑和抵赖终究是无济于事的。于是，它又挖空心思制造各种根据，硬要使人相信进行细菌战并非罪恶，企图预先准备舆论，开脱自己的罪责。为了这个目的，它已经捏造出三种无耻荒唐的论据。但是美国侵略者在这里却又不小心地暴露了他们犯下细菌战的滔天罪行的血腥面目。
    第一个荒唐的说法是：细菌战并不是非法的。美国战争贩子的喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”在三月二十一日出版的一期中，发表了一篇疯狂宣传细菌战的文章。这篇文章对于“美国陆军是否正在积极试验细菌战争？”的问题，毫不隐讳地作了肯定的答复，并且承认：“自第二次世界大战初期以来它就一直这样做了”。这篇文章同时承认：“如共方所指责的——把带病的动物和昆虫从飞机上散放在广泛的地区内”，美国“不是不能做到”的。这篇文章用了很多篇幅来毫不知耻地鼓吹细菌战，最后它提出一个问题说：“有反对使用生物战的，如同反对使用毒气的国际协定一样的任何国际协定吗？”它竟然厚颜无耻地回答说：“很显然的是没有的。”美国侵略者竟敢在光天化日之下抹煞尽人皆知的事实，这正是它无耻面目的赤裸裸的暴露。事实是：无论是一八九九年或是一九零七年的海牙公约，都规定禁止使用有毒武器，就是美国陆军部在“陆战规则”中也承认：海牙公约的这一规定适用于禁止使用散布传染病的手段。一九二五年日内瓦议定书更明确地规定禁止细菌武器，而美国是当时的签字国之一。但是，美国侵略者这种无耻的否认恰恰证明了自己的罪行，使狐狸终究露出了尾巴。
    美国侵略者第二种无耻而拙劣的手法是：荒谬地引证历史，妄想借此开脱进行细菌战的罪责。上述“美国新闻与世界报道”在同一篇文章中写道：
    “过去有没有用细菌战来对付人们的实际例子？有的，曾有好多次以有限度的范围进行过。美国军事官员相信，在第二次世界大战中，日本人在中国军队中散布过一场小瘟疫。在第一次世界大战中，德国人用病毒传染了若干联军的马匹，希望疾病传布到军队中去。几百年以前，英国人当退兵的时候，把带有鼠疫菌的衣服留在后面，挺进的法国军队在夺得并穿上这些衣服之后，传布了鼠疫，于是，吃了败仗。再往前说，罗马军队把死者的尸体装在投射机上射入围城，引起了严重瘟疫，使占领城市之举变得容易一些。”这种拙劣的手法又恰恰是美国侵略者进行细菌战的不打自招的供状！它竭力想在现在就证明它并不是进行细菌战的开山鼻祖，而是有前例可援的，以为历史能够帮助它在将来减轻和卸脱自己的罪责。可是创造历史的人民却从来不曾放过历史上任何一个胆敢屠杀人民的刽子手。美国的战争罪犯们妄想到罗马时代去找他们的祖宗是徒然的，你们最好去翻翻近在眼前的历史，看看在纽伦堡法庭和伯力法庭上受审判的人的下场。美国侵略者的狂言呓语显然非但不能开脱他们的罪责，相反地，是将来在审判这些罪犯们的法庭上的有力证据。
    美国侵略者还有一套法宝就是：耍流氓、耍无赖。美国“纽约时报”三月十六日在“科学一览”栏中一方面竭力抵赖它进行细菌战的罪行，同时，留下后步，极端无耻地散布谎言说：“中国充满了带有病菌的老鼠和跳蚤，再多几个也不会把那里特有的疾病变成流行病。”美国侵略者自作聪明的想法就是：万一在抵赖不过去的时候，还可以强横地摆出流氓架子，死不认罪地使用无赖的口吻说：细菌我是投了，可是你那里既然本来就有细菌，我再投下一些也无所谓。这难道还是文明人类的语言吗？不是的！这是强盗的逻辑！魔鬼的嘶叫！至于说到美国侵略者制造出来的谎话本身，那更是不值一笑。谁都知道：美英帝国主义对于伟大的中华人民共和国是极端仇恨而无可如何的。他们只好采用最无知的咒骂、诬蔑和造谣手段来企图中伤我国。早在一九五○年七月十日英帝国主义香港政府就造谣宣布厦门是鼠疫港。一九五一年三月美帝国主义控制的世界卫生组织为了执行美国封锁我国的命令，又曾无耻造谣宣布我全部海岸港口是疫情港。事实上，中国既不是“充满带有病菌的老鼠和跳蚤”，也没有什么“特有的疾病”，自从中央人民政府成立以来，所有的流行性传染病早已被控制住了。在朝鲜，就像前已指出的，历史上从来就没有过鼠疫。霍乱从一九四七年来就已在朝鲜北部绝迹。如果今天忽然出现了带有病菌的老鼠和跳蚤，除了是美国侵略者投下的以外，就不可能有其他的原因。美国侵略者企图用这种愚蠢的谎话和强盗的逻辑来耍流氓，耍无赖，正好揭穿了这个使用细菌武器来屠杀朝中人民的狰狞的凶手面目。
    从美国侵略者只是制造一些拙劣的造谣诬蔑而不敢提到任何一个揭发其罪行的事实，从艾奇逊只是矢口抵赖而丝毫不敢斥责细菌战为非法非人道的行为，从美国宣传工具所作的荒谬的诡辩，人们处处都可以看出美国侵略者贼胆心虚，捉襟见肘的窘态。所有这一切无耻的狡赖诬蔑和诡辩，不但丝毫不能开脱美国侵略者进行细菌战的严重罪行，而且是美国侵略者进行细菌战的有力反证。美国侵略者对于它进行细菌战的严重罪责，是无论如何逃不脱的，它最后必将受到全世界人民最严厉的正义的制裁！
