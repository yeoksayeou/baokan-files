    Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: While people all over the world are indignantly denouncing the towering crimes of the American aggressors in waging bacteriological warfare, the British government, not hesitating to follow its American master with slavish obedience, is barking wildly with extreme shamelessness, attempting to absolve its American master from guilt.
    On March 4th, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office made a shameful statement, echoing the words of the American master, slandering the accusations of the Chinese and Korean people regarding the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare as "absurd and disgraceful." The British official propaganda organ, the British Information Services, also published a completely fabricated commentary on the same day in the name of a diplomatic correspondent, repeating the lies spread by the British Foreign Office spokesperson with very few changes in wording.
    However, the British government's shameless denial and sophistry for its American master could neither cover up the crimes of the American aggressors in waging bacteriological warfare nor quell the righteous anger of the people around the world. Therefore, on March 19th, the British Foreign Office spokesperson, under the orders of its American master, had to brace himself and come out once again to spread lies. The spokesperson once again made a shameless slander against the just accusations of the Korean and Chinese people, saying: "The British government believes that this attack has no basis whatsoever and is utterly absurd and dishonorable." Since this spokesperson himself knew that these sophistries and slanders, which could not offer any arguments, were obviously not enough to deceive people, he tried his best to find a so-called basis: "The British government has inquired about this matter with the American government and the United Nations Command in Korea, and we have received replies from them guaranteeing without any doubt that they have not only not engaged in bacteriological warfare in Korea but have not even considered engaging in such warfare." Thus, in front of the people of the world, there appeared such an extremely ridiculous and absurd scene: in order to prove his innocence, a murderer brought in his accomplice as a defense lawyer, and in order to defend the murderer, this accomplice brought in the murderer himself as a witness.
    The British government's shameless sophistry for the American aggressors, this foolish sophistry that is very similar to a bandit who is keeping watch outside the door insisting that another robber who is robbing inside the house is not a robber, not only cannot absolve the American aggressors from guilt, but further exposes that the British government itself is completely a running dog of the American aggressors and is a deadly enemy of human justice and security just like the American aggressors.

### 英国政府竟替美国开脱罪责无狡赖

    英国政府竟替美国开脱罪责无狡赖
    【新华社二十二日讯】在全世界人民义愤填膺地声讨美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行的同时，英国政府竟不惜奴颜卑膝地追随其美国主子之后，极端无耻地狺狺狂吠，妄图为其美国主子脱罪。
    三月四日，英国外交部发言人发表了一通可耻的谈话，学着美国主人的舌头，污蔑中朝人民对于美国侵略者进行细菌战的控诉，是“荒谬的和可耻的”。英国官方宣传机关英国新闻处在同日也以外交记者的名义发表了一条完全撒谎的评论，把英国外交部发言人散布的谎话，连字句都很少变动地重复了一遍。
    可是，英国政府为他美国主人进行的无耻抵赖和狡辩，既无法掩盖住美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行，又不可能平息全世界人民的正义愤怒，于是在三月十九日，英国外交部发言人奉美国主子之命，不得不硬着头皮再一次出来散布谎话。该发言人对于朝中人民的正义控诉再一次进行无耻的污蔑说：“英国政府认为：这一攻击没有任何根据，而且是荒谬绝伦和不名誉的。”由于这个发言人自己也知道这些提不出任何论据的狡赖和污蔑显然不足以骗人，因此他就费尽心计找出了一条所谓根据：“英国政府曾就这事询问过美国政府和朝鲜联合国军司令部，我们得到的答复是，它们毫无问题地保证，它们不仅没有在朝鲜进行细菌战争，而且根本没有考虑到进行这种战争。”于是，在全世界人民的面前，就出现了这样一个极端滑稽而又荒唐的场面：杀人犯为了要证明自己无罪，把自己的帮凶找来当辩护人，这个帮凶为了要替杀人犯辩护，又把杀人犯自己找来当见证人。
    英国政府这种替美国侵略者进行的厚颜无耻的狡赖，这种很像一个在门外把风的匪徒硬说在屋内进行抢劫的另一个强盗不是强盗一类的愚蠢的狡赖，不仅不能替美国侵略者开脱罪责，反而更加暴露了英国政府自己完全是美国侵略者的走卒，是和美国侵略者一样是人类正义和安全的死敌。
