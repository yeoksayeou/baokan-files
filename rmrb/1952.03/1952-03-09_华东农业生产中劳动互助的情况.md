    The Situation and Characteristics of Original Labor Mutual Aid in Rural Areas

    The various forms of agricultural production mutual aid organizations originally existing among farmers in East China can be roughly divided into the following types:

    (1) Mutual adjustment of manpower or mutual aid of manpower and farm tools centered on large farm tools, including "exchange labor," "adjust labor," "pair labor," "accompany labor," "even labor," "labor for labor," "accompany water," "back-to-back," "join in," "work together," "help," "combine helpers," "team up," "partner," etc. These organizations are generally formed spontaneously by farmers during busy farming seasons such as sowing, transplanting, and harvesting, when working alone would delay the farming season. Some large farm tools, such as foot-operated waterwheels, cannot be used by one or two laborers alone; families with waterwheels but lacking labor need help from others, and families without waterwheels need to exchange manpower for the use of waterwheels to solve difficulties, so they help each other.

    Among this type, the following forms are relatively special:

    One is the "large accompaniment labor" in Songjiang Special District of Southern Jiangsu and the "team labor," "work together," "supplement labor" in Southern Anhui. Because these areas are close to the river and sea, natural disasters pose a greater threat to agricultural production, and nearby farmers have common interests. However, water conservancy construction for drought resistance and flood drainage cannot be carried out by a few farmers alone. Therefore, at critical moments in production, farmers spontaneously organize themselves. This organization is relatively large in scale, generally based on the acreage of benefited fields, with those with more fields and less labor paying wages.

    Another is the "dahunzuo" in Wujiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places in Southern Jiangsu. Land and farm tools still belong to individuals, but work is planned in advance, and everyone plows, plants, and harvests together. Wages are not recorded at ordinary times, but accounts are settled after the autumn harvest, and wages are paid. This organizational form originated in the water network area around Taihu Lake. Because the land there is far from home, making individual operation inconvenient, farmers spontaneously organized themselves to carry out collective production.

    Another is the "mountain opening team" in the mountainous areas of Zhejiang. The farmers participating in the "mountain opening team" all go up the mountain to reclaim wasteland and plant corn. Because opening mountains requires greater labor intensity, farmers organize themselves to go up the mountain collectively. In addition to producing for themselves, this "mountain opening team" also collectively sells labor to help wealthy and middle peasants open mountains.

    (2) Mutual adjustment of animal power or exchange of labor and cattle centered on animal power. In Shandong, Northern Anhui, and Northern Jiangsu, it is called "ge ju," and there is a "cattle team" organization in the suburbs of Nanjing. In general areas, it is called "jointly raising cattle."

    "Ge ju" is an organization for mutual aid in animal power. In some areas, because one ox cannot pull a plow, two oxen must be used together. Therefore, households with oxen who are of like mind cooperate in plowing the land. "Jointly raising cattle" is more common in various places. Some families buy cattle together and take turns feeding them. In Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui, it is called "supporting the cattle leg," and four families share one ox, which is called "one ox leg per family." Some families buy cattle, and other families "provide cattle grass"; families that "provide cattle grass" have certain usage rights for the cattle. There is also a type called "gan da," where households without cattle use cattle and pay a certain price, but are not responsible for feeding them.

    The exchange of labor and cattle is very common in various places and does not have a fixed name. Roughly, there are two forms: one is that households without cattle borrow cattle and repay with manpower; the other is that the cattle owner or the herdboy comes with the cattle, which is equivalent to the cattle-owning household plowing for the non-cattle-owning household, and the labor repayment includes the labor of the cattle owner.

    (3) Collective sale of labor. This is a larger-scale adjustment of labor. Because the agricultural seasons vary from place to place, poor farmers organize themselves to collectively sell labor to areas that need labor. After the land reform, poor farmers were allocated land, and this form of collective sale of labor has gradually decreased.

    In the collective sale of labor, in addition to selling manpower, there is also a collective sale of animal power in Northern Jiangsu. During the harvest season in rice-growing areas, farmers from dry-land areas bring large numbers of cattle to help with work. This situation is very common in the Yancheng and Huai'an area.

    The above are several types of original labor mutual aid in East China. In the new districts of Jiangnan, these types are relatively common. According to estimates in Southern Jiangsu, before liberation, households participating in these mutual aid organizations accounted for 50% to 60% of the total rural households in the Songjiang and Suzhou special districts, and 70% to 80% in the Zhenjiang and Changzhou special districts. One reason is that industry and commerce are developed in Jiangnan, and a large number of laborers flow to the cities, so laborers engaged in agricultural production need mutual aid to solve difficulties. Another reason is that many agricultural tasks in Jiangnan cannot be undertaken by a few farmers, such as water pumping and pond repair; especially in coastal and riverside areas, only by organizing can disasters be overcome. A third reason is that land is scarce, and farmers must also engage in sideline businesses; in order to take into account both agriculture and sideline businesses, they must organize themselves.

    These production cooperative organizations spontaneously organized on the basis of small-scale peasant economy have the following common characteristics:

    1.  The strata participating in the organizations are mostly middle peasants who have farm tools but lack labor and cannot afford to hire laborers, and poor peasants who have labor but lack farm tools. Wealthy peasants who can afford to hire laborers and have sufficient farm tools rarely participate. Therefore, it is basically a "poor help poor" organization. As Chairman Mao said, they are "merely a manifestation of the tragic life of peasants in the old era." Because middle peasants have farm tools and livestock, they often become the central figures of primitive mutual aid.

    2.  The scale is relatively small, generally two or three households, three or five households helping each other, and very few have more than eight or nine households. Because the purpose of the organization is only to overcome difficulties in production, it is generally temporary. They cooperate during the busy farming season and go their separate ways after the busy farming season is over. At the same time, it is generally not fixed. This season I am with you, and next season I am with him.

    3.  The scope of mutual aid members is relatively narrow, generally only young and middle-aged people participate, and the elderly, weak, and women do not participate. It is mostly based on emotional ties.

    4.  There are unreasonable aspects within these mutual aid organizations, for example:

    *   Poor peasants have to suffer some losses; but even knowing that they are suffering losses, they have to help each other. The main areas where they suffer losses are doing the work first or last and unequal exchange. In order to use the middle peasants' cattle and farm tools, the poor peasants have to do work for the middle peasants first. The crops of poor peasants who transplant seedlings late are not as good as those of middle peasants who transplant seedlings early, and there may even be a difference of 10% to 20%. In the exchange of manpower and cattle labor, cattle labor is often higher than manpower.

    *   The phenomenon of waste is very serious (including waste of expenses and waste of manpower). The waste of expenses is manifested in eating well when doing work for someone's family. Some places in Southern Jiangsu stipulate "three teas, four meals, and five rounds of smoking." The waste of manpower is manifested in the lack of scientific division of labor, with too many people and a chaotic work environment, making it impossible to get things done.

    *   In the collective sale of labor, the foreman takes a commission, which is equivalent to intermediate exploitation.

    *   In many places, women are not allowed to participate in labor, for fear of "breaking the feng shui," which hinders the enthusiasm of the broad masses of rural women for labor.

    The Development Process and Current Situation of Labor Mutual Aid in East China Since the Anti-Japanese War

    The organized labor mutual aid with leadership in the old areas of East China (including Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui) began in 1943 after Chairman Mao called for organization. At that time, after the rent reduction movement, the peasants were generally mobilized, and their enthusiasm for production increased; however, there were difficulties with manpower, cattle power, and farm tools. Therefore, after the leadership called for it, various places developed from typical experiments to relatively widespread organization.

    During the Anti-Japanese War from 1943 to 1945, labor mutual aid in various places developed from typical experiments to a widespread scale. During the Liberation War from 1946 to 1948, a large number of young and middle-aged people in Shandong joined the army and supported the front line. In order to overcome production difficulties, mutual aid organizations were further developed on a large scale; Northern Jiangsu entered a war environment behind enemy lines, and mutual aid organizations began to develop spontaneously; during the temporary occupation of Northern Anhui by the enemy, mutual aid organizations suffered devastation. After 1949, due to the victory of the war, stable environment, and relative increase in labor, coupled with the improvement of peasants' lives and production conditions after the land reform, grassroots cadres mistakenly believed that it was no longer necessary to organize labor mutual aid; the leaders in various places also relaxed their leadership due to having more tasks; thus, labor mutual aid in the old areas showed a spontaneous state. Leaders in many areas of Shandong had not inquired about this matter for two years, and grassroots cadres believed that "this is not the way to do things"; it was not until the State Council issued instructions in 1951 that they began to rectify the situation.

    Due to the impact of past organization on peasants and the increased enthusiasm of peasants for production, many mutual aid teams have persisted in various places. Such as the Lu Hongbin mutual aid team in Shandong and the Chen Weifang mutual aid team in Northern Jiangsu. However, individual regions have not yet escaped the state of spontaneous development.

    Southern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and parts of Northern Anhui's newly liberated areas also have a group of mutual aid teams organized under leadership. These mutual aid teams were generally organized during the production and disaster relief movement in the winter of 1949 and the spring of 1950. At the beginning, many were engaged in sideline production, and the profits obtained from sideline production were used as food to get through the famine.

    When the spring plowing season arrived in the spring of 1950, the disaster was not yet over in various places, but spring plowing and sowing could not wait. Under the slogan of "both spring plowing and disaster relief," most of the mutual aid teams developed from simply engaging in sideline production to combining agricultural production and sideline production. In areas with larger-scale water conservancy projects in Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui, the vast majority of male laborers participated in river management, and women's mutual aid teams staying at home had a great development. After the autumn of 1950, leading cadres in various places concentrated their efforts on leading the land reform and did not pay close attention to mutual aid teams; however, a large part of the mutual aid organizations that developed in production and disaster relief still persisted. Such as the Lü Dongyang mutual aid team in Fuyang County, Northern Anhui, and the Dong Cuiqin mutual aid team in Pi County, Northern Jiangsu.

    In the development process of the above-mentioned mutual aid teams in new and old areas, there is a common feature, that is, although leadership was once relaxed in some areas, many mutual aid organizations in rural areas were still preserved. This shows that regardless of new or old areas, peasants have an urgent demand for organizing to develop production.

    The saying that "the level of rural production in old areas has improved, the lives of peasants have risen, and labor mutual aid is not needed" and the saying that "there is no shortage of labor in new areas, and it is not necessary to organize labor mutual aid" are both one-sided and wrong.

    According to preliminary statistics, the scale of mutual aid teams in various places, regardless of new or old areas, ranges from three households for small teams to ten households for large teams, generally around five households. There are also large teams with more than twenty households in one administrative village, but these large teams are also divided into several small teams. The reasons for grouping are, first, because it is inconvenient to work with too many people and too large a team; second, it is for the convenience of leadership. This situation is generally adapted to local production conditions and the existing mutual aid experience of peasants.

    Divided by the content of the mutual aid team, there are roughly the following types:

    (1) Pure "exchange labor" or pure "ge ju"; this is basically still a primitive form of mutual aid and still exists in large numbers in rural areas everywhere.

    (2) Mutual adjustment in manpower and cattle power or manpower and farm tools, but purely mutual aid in agricultural production, and with great seasonality and instability, "mutual aid in busy times, scattered in slack times," "organized in spring, collapsed in summer, re-organized next spring plowing."

    (3) Relatively fixed year-round mutual aid teams. The characteristics are: ? Implement comprehensive mutual aid in labor, draft animals, and farm tools; ? Combine sideline production, and implement year-round mutual aid regardless of busy or slack farming seasons; ? Some also combine with improving farming techniques and handling supply and marketing businesses, enriching the content of mutual aid, increasing income, and further consolidating the mutual aid team. All mutual aid teams that persist year-round belong to this category.

    (4) Agricultural production cooperatives that have appeared in some sparsely populated rural areas and disaster areas: such as the mutual aid teams in Wanjiawuzi, Sanliushu, Houdong, and Pojiazhuang villages in the seventh district of Guangrao County, Shandong, the Song Zongguo mutual aid team in Zhougezhuang, Jiaodong, Zhao Zhuang village in Machang district and Liang Lianbi mutual aid team in Tanggou district, Shuyang, Northern Jiangsu. The Sanliushu mutual aid team in Guangrao County implements land and labor as shares, "collective labor, public work, and public harvest, profit sharing according to labor." (Editor's note: It is not appropriate to allocate dividends for land as shares, as is generally done in agricultural production cooperatives today; however, it is okay for existing cooperatives to adopt this practice if they wish to try it.) The Song Zongguo team merges the land together, sells the individual livestock and farm tools to the team at a discounted price, and uses the land, farm tools, livestock, and labor in a unified plan and unified use, and distributes grain according to large and small mouths. The Liang Lianbi mutual aid team implements division of labor according to each person's expertise and collective meals. (Editor's note: The methods of distributing grain according to the size of the family and eating collective meals are inappropriate. It is possible to allocate a certain amount of harvest according to the land invested, and obtain reasonable prices for the invested tools and livestock, while implementing piecework pay and profit sharing according to labor. The proportion of distributing harvests according to land and labor should be determined according to the wishes of the various members of the cooperative and the conditions of local economic development.)

    Although the composition and cooperation methods of these agricultural production cooperatives are different, they are all approved and satisfied by the team members, and the masses outside the cooperative express envy when they see that they produce more grain.

    Among the above types, the first and second types account for the majority, the third type is a minority, and the fourth type is individual. In the development and improvement of agricultural production, the role of agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations has these aspects:

    1.  Organizing mutual aid and cooperation can overcome various difficulties in agricultural production in a planned way, and rationally use manpower, animal power, and farm tools, thereby gradually overcoming the weaknesses of small-scale peasant economy. Individual peasants often find it difficult to cope with sudden agricultural operations such as harvesting wheat, weeding, transplanting seedlings, and pumping water. After organizing, it is possible to uniformly allocate labor according to the order of farming time for each family, helping each other in urgent and slow times, and ensuring timely farming. The Chen Weifang mutual aid team in Northern Jiangsu harvested wheat last year, and because of collective harvesting, they finished harvesting one and a half days earlier than individual households. Individual households, except for wealthy peasants, often find it difficult to obtain a complete set of farm tools, especially large farm tools, such as waterwheels and large carts. Many poor peasants lack draft animals. After organizing, it is possible to implement mutual exchange of manpower and farm tools or animal power, with those who have farm tools or draft animals helping those who do not have farm tools or draft animals, and fully utilize the existing farm tools and draft animals.

    2.  Organizing mutual aid and cooperation can save labor, implement a more scientific division of labor, and avoid waste of labor. When peasants work individually, each person's labor has strengths and weaknesses, and production technology has highs and lows. There is a shortage of labor during busy farming seasons and a surplus of labor during slack farming seasons. Therefore, individual operation by each family wastes a lot of labor. After organizing, during busy farming seasons, it is possible to appropriately divide the work according to the strengths and expertise of each person, so that each peasant can fully play a role; during slack farming seasons, it is also possible to organize surplus labor, capital, and tools to engage in other production. The Lü Dongyang mutual aid team in Northern Anhui has begun to implement the division of labor and industries, so that each team member can do their best. During busy farming seasons, sideline production can still be carried out. The Xu Guirong mutual aid team in Zhejiang invested most of its labor in sideline production after the autumn harvest. Many mutual aid teams in various places actively engage in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation in winter to prepare for the large-scale production in spring. The income of team members in all mutual aid teams that do well in this regard exceeds that of individual peasants.

    3.  Organizing mutual aid and cooperation can greatly improve the enthusiasm of peasants for production and labor efficiency, enable intensive farming, and also facilitate political education for peasants, cultivate peasants' collective concepts, and implement production policies. As the Chen Weifang mutual aid team in Northern Jiangsu put forward the slogan: "Hoeing is afraid of three, cattle are afraid of two ju", as long as the organization is good, the more people there are, the higher the morale of work, mutual supervision, and the more energetic they become, two people can抵three people. Individual peasants are often afraid to easily carry out new attempts that they have not experienced before because the land is limited. After organizing mutual aid and cooperation, there are more people and more wisdom. Under the promotion of advanced elements, it is easy to overcome conservative ideas and give play to collective wisdom to study and try out advanced farming methods. Guo Yongbin, a member of the Song Shikun mutual aid team in Shandong, never selected seeds or applied fertilizer in the past. After participating in the mutual aid team, under the influence of everyone, he applied 150 kilograms of soybean cake to the corn he planted the year before, and changed to improved varieties of sweet potatoes and wheat, resulting in a very good harvest. His grandfather said: "Old ideas won't work anymore. If you want to produce more grain in the future, you have to learn new methods." After the East China Military and Political Committee issued the "Ten Policies for Developing Agricultural Production" last year, many mutual aid teams conducted repeated discussions. In particular, after the call for the patriotic production increase movement was put forward, almost all mutual aid teams formulated patriotic production increase plans from the team to the household based on local conditions; advanced mutual aid teams also challenged Li Shunda, further stimulating the enthusiasm of peasants for production.

    4.  Organizing mutual aid and cooperation can start undertakings that individual peasants cannot start, can collectively purchase new-style farm tools that individual peasants cannot afford, and can overcome natural disasters that individual peasants cannot overcome. The Yu Songchang mutual aid team in Shandong improved the soil of more than 130 mu of land by pressing sand and dug dozens of wells successively, greatly increasing the yield of crops. The Lü Hongbin mutual aid team in Shandong currently has three 7-inch step plows, four liberation-style waterwheels, three sprayers, and two corn threshers. In the vast rural areas along the Huai River, due to the organization of mutual aid and cooperation, a large number of laborers can be drawn to participate in the management of the Huai River, so that the great task of permanently controlling the Huai River can be gradually realized. Last year, in areas where drought occurred, many mutual aid teams organized a large number of waterwheels to solve the problem of water shortage; in areas where insect pests occurred, the masses were organized to collectively eliminate insect pests, ensuring the growth of seedlings.

    In addition to the several main functions mentioned above, organizing mutual aid and cooperation can also solve the production and living difficulties of team members. For example, Song Fuzhuang, a member of the Dong Chonghua mutual aid team in Songjiagou Village, Kunyu County, Shandong, used to work independently. He was sick the year before last, and he lacked food last spring; after joining the mutual aid team, other team members in the same team lent him food to get through the spring famine; last year, not only was production timely, but he also earned 140 kilograms of grain. As another example, a team member in the Chen Weifang mutual aid team in Northern Jiangsu had a death in his family and prepared to sell two mu of superior land; later, the team lent him grain to solve the difficulties of the funeral and did not sell the land. Last July, Chen Fabi, a member of the Ge Laowu mutual aid team in Jianyang County, Fujian, died of illness, leaving behind his wife and two children, who were in financial difficulties. Ge Laowu called for carrying forward class friendship, and the entire team bought a coffin for the deceased, paid off his debts, and helped his family harvest five mu of early rice early and completed the autumn planting and autumn harvest.

    Because mutual aid and cooperation have so many functions in agricultural production, the crop yields of team members in all mutual aid teams that do well have increased significantly. The Lu Hongbin mutual aid team in Shandong, which is more prominent, has not only exceeded the pre-war level of production for the entire team, but has also approached 余一 (a surplus of one crop for every one crop), and Lu himself has exceeded 余一. Even temporary seasonal mutual aid teams have a greater role in agricultural production development than ordinary independent households; year-round mutual aid that combines sideline businesses and improves farming techniques has an even more significant role. Agricultural production cooperatives have more significant advantages in the centralized use of land, farm tools, and draft animals. In short, in all mutual aid teams that are doing relatively well, the production and living standards of peasants have been greatly improved, some have survived severe disasters, some have surplus grain, and the political awareness of peasants has been improved, and the habit of collective labor has been cultivated; the transformation of lazy people and second-rate people has also played a great role.

    华东农业生产中劳动互助的情况
    中共中央华东局农村工作委员会农业互助研究组
    农村中原有的劳动互助的情况和特点
    华东各地农民相互间原有的各种形式的农业生产互助组织，大体可分为下面的几种类型：
    （一）人力互相调剂的或以大型农具为中心实行人力与农具互助的，有“换工”、“调工”、“对工”、“伴工”、“匀工”、“工顶工”、“伴水”、“靠背”、“插伙”、“打伙”、“帮工”、“合帮子”、“搭班”、“合伙”等。这些组织，一般是在播种、插秧、收割等紧张的农忙季节，单干会耽误农时，由农民自动组织起来的。有些大型农具，像脚踏的水车，不是一两个劳动力所能使用的；有水车的人家缺少劳力时，需要别人帮助，无水车的人家需要用人力换取水车使用，解决困难，于是就互助起来。
    在这一类型中，比较特殊的有如下几种形式：
    一种是苏南松江专区的“大伴工”和皖南的“搭工”、“搭伙”、“贴工”等。因为这些地区靠近江、海，自然灾害对农业生产的威胁较大，附近农民都有共同的利害关系，而兴修水利抗旱排涝又非少数农民所能进行，因此在生产紧张关头，农民就自动地组织起来。这种组织，规模较大，一般是按受益的田亩出工，田多劳动力少的出工资。
    一种是苏南吴江、苏州、无锡等地的“打混作”。土地、农具还是各人的，做活事先计划好，一起耕，一起种，一起收，平时不记工，到秋收后结账，支付工资。这种组织形式，产生在太湖边水网地区。那里的农民因为地离家远，个体经营不便，就自动组织起来，进行集体生产。
    一种是浙江山区的“开山班”。参加“开山班”的农民，都是上山开荒种玉米的。因开山需要发挥更大的劳动强度，农民便组织起来集体上山。这种“开山班”除了为自己生产外，也有集体出卖劳动力，替富农、中农开山的。
    （二）畜力互助调剂，或以畜力为中心，实行人牛换工的，在山东、皖北、苏北一带叫“搿犋”，南京市郊有“牛帮”的组织，一般地区叫做“伙养牛”。
    “搿犋”是畜力互助的组织。在某些地区，由于一条牛拉不动犁，必须两头耕牛合拉才行，于是情投意合的有牛户，便合作耕地。“伙养牛”各地比较普遍。有的是几家合伙买，轮流喂养。在苏北和皖北叫做“帮牛腿”，一条牛四家共有就叫“一家一条牛腿”。有的是一家买牛，别的人家“贴牛草”；“贴牛草”的人家，对耕牛有一定的使用权利。也有的叫“干搭”，无牛户使用耕牛，出一定代价，但不负责喂养。
    人牛换工各地很普遍，无一定名称，大体上有两种形式：一种是无牛户借用耕牛，还给人工；另一种是牛主或带着牧童与牛同来，等于有牛户替无牛户代耕，还工时则包括牛主的人工在内。
    （三）集体卖工。这是一种较大范围内的劳动力调剂。由于各地农事季节有先后，贫苦农民便组织起来到需要劳力的地区去集体出卖劳动力。土地改革后，贫苦农民都分得土地，这种集体卖工的形式，已逐渐减少。
    在集体卖工中，除出卖人力外，在苏北还有集体出卖畜力的。在水稻地区收割季节，旱田地区的农民便牵着大批耕牛前来帮工。这种情形，在盐阜地区很普遍。
    以上是华东各地原有劳动互助的几种类型。在江南新区，这几种类型都比较普遍。据苏南估计，解放以前参加这些互助组织的农户，在松江、苏州两专区占农村总户口的百分之五十到六十，镇江、常州两专区为百分之七十到八十。原因之一是江南工商业发达，大批劳动力流向城市，从事农业生产的劳动力需要互助解决困难。原因之二是江南好多农作不是少数农民所能担任的，如车水、修塘等；尤其是沿海沿江地区，只有组织起来才能战胜灾害。原因之三是土地少，农民必需附带经营副业；为了兼顾农、副业，必须组织起来。
    这些在小农经济基础上自动组织起来的生产合作组织，有以下几个共同特点：
    一、参加组织的阶层，大多是有农具但缺乏劳动力又雇不起雇工的中农和有劳动力缺乏农具的贫农，有钱雇工和农具充足的富农很少参加。因此，基本上是一种“穷帮穷”的组织。正如毛主席所说：它们“只是旧时代农民悲惨生活的表现”。因为中农有农具、牲畜，所以中农又往往成为原始互助的中心人物。
    二、规模比较小，一般是二、三户，三、五户在一起互助，八、九户以上的很少。因为组织的目的只是为了克服生产中的困难，所以一般都是临时性的，农忙时合作，农忙一过就各干各的。同时，一般都是不固定的，这个季节我和你在一起，下一季节就和他在一起。
    三、互助成员的范围比较狭小，一般只是青壮年参加，老弱妇女不参加，大多以感情结合为基础。
    四、这些互助组织的内部，都有不够合理的地方，例如：
    ?贫农多少要吃点亏；但明知吃亏，也得互助。吃亏的地方主要在先做后做和不等价交换上。贫农为了使用中农的耕牛和农具，就得先替中农做活。栽秧栽得迟的贫农，收成就没有栽得早的中农好，甚至有相差到一成二成的。在人工与牛工的交换上，往往是牛工高于人工。
    ?浪费现象很严重（包括费用上的浪费和人力上的浪费）。费用上的浪费表现在做那家活吃那家饭时，要吃得好。苏南有些地方规定“三茶、四饭、五遍烟”。人力上的浪费表现在没有科学的分工，人多手杂，做不出活。
    ?集体卖工中工头要抽头钱，等于中间剥削。
    ?好多地方不许妇女参加劳动，怕“破了风水”，这妨碍了广大农村妇女劳动积极性的发挥。
    抗日战争以来华东劳动互助
    的发展过程和目前情况
    华东老区（包括山东、苏北、皖北）有领导的组织劳动互助，是在一九四三年毛主席号召组织起来之后开始的。当时在减租运动之后，农民普遍地发动起来了，生产积极性提高了；可是，人力、牛力、农具都有困难。因此，经领导上号召之后，各地就由典型试验到比较普遍地组织起来。
    一九四三年到一九四五年的抗日战争时期，各地的劳动互助由典型试验走到面的发展。一九四六年到一九四八年的解放战争时期，山东大批青壮年参军、支援前线，为了克服生产困难，进一步大量发展互助组织；苏北转入敌后战争环境，互助组织开始自流；皖北地区为敌暂时占领期间，互助组织遭受了摧残。一九四九年以后，由于战争胜利，环境安定，劳动力相对地增加，加上土地改革后农民生活上升和生产条件改善，基层干部就错认为不必再组织劳动互助了；各地领导方面，由于任务较多，也放松了领导；于是，老区的劳动互助，呈现了自流状态。山东不少地区的领导干部，就有二年没有过问这事，基层干部认为“不兴这一套”了；直到一九五一年政务院发布指示后，才开始着手整顿。
    由于过去较长时期内组织起来给农民的影响，以及农民生产积极性的提高，各地仍有很多互助组坚持下来。如山东的吕鸿宾互助组，苏北的陈维芳互助组等。但是，个别地区至今仍然没有摆脱自流状态。
    苏南、皖南、浙江、福建以及皖北一部分新解放区，目前也有了一批有领导地组织起来的互助组。这批互助组，一般都是在一九四九年冬、一九五○年春生产救灾运动中组织起来的，开始时很多是搞副业生产，以副业生产所获得的利润作度荒的口粮。
    一九五○年春耕季节到来时，各地灾荒还没度过，而春耕播种又迫不及待，于是在“春耕度荒两不误”的口号下，大部分互助组由单纯经营副业生产，发展到农业生产和副业生产相结合。苏北、皖北水利工程规模较大的地区，男劳动力绝大部分参加治河，留在家的妇女互助组，有了很大的发展。在一九五○年秋季以后，各地领导干部集中力量领导土地改革，对互助组没有抓紧；但在生产救灾中发展起来的互助组织，仍有很大一部分坚持下来。如皖北阜阳县吕东扬互助组，苏北邳睢县董翠琴互助组等。
    在上述新老地区互助组的发展过程中，有一个共同的特点，即部分地区虽一度放松领导，农村中的互助组织，仍有不少保存了下来。这说明不论新区老区，农民对组织起来发展生产是有迫切要求的。
    “老区农村生产水平提高了，农民生活上升了，劳动互助不需要了”的说法，和“新区劳动力不缺乏，不必组织劳动互助”的说法，都是片面的，错误的。
    据初步统计，各地互助组的规模，不论新区老区，小的三户，大的十户，一般在五户左右。也有多至二十多户到一个行政村的大组，但这些大组下面，还分若干小组。分组的原因，第一是因为人多、组大，做活不便；第二是为了便于领导。这种情形，一般是和当地生产条件以及农民过去已有的互助经验相适应的。
    以互助组的内容来分，大致有下面几种类型：
    （一）单纯的“换工”，或单纯的“搿犋”；这基本上还是原始的互助形式，仍在各地农村大量地存在着。
    （二）在人力和牛力或人力和农具上互有调剂，但单纯属于农业生产上的互助，且带有很大的季节性和不固定性，“忙时互助闲时散”，“春组织，夏垮台，明年春耕重新来”。
    （三）比较固定的常年互助组。特点是：?实行劳力、耕畜、农具全面互助；?结合副业生产，不管农忙农闲，实行常年互助；?有的还和提高耕作技术以及办理供销事业结合起来，充实了互助的内容，增加了收入，使互助组进一步地巩固起来。凡是坚持常年的互助组，大体上都属于这一类。
    （四）在部分地广人稀的农村和灾区里出现的农业生产合作社：如山东广饶县七区万家屋子，三柳树、后董、坡家庄等村的互助组，胶东周格庄宋宗国互助组，苏北沭阳马厂区赵庄村以及塘沟区梁连必互助组。广饶县三柳树互助组实行以土地和劳力入股，“集体劳动，公打公收，按劳分红”。（编者按：入股的土地不分红，在今天作为农业生产合作社的一般做法是不合适的；但是已有的社如采取这种做法也不妨试行。）宋宗国组是土地合并一起，个人的牲口农具折价卖给组内，土地农具牲口劳力统一计划统一使用，按大口小口分粮。梁连必互助组则实行按各人专长分工，集体吃饭。（编者按：按大口小口分粮和集体吃饭的方式是不适当的。可按入股的土地分配一定的收获量，并按入股的工具，牲畜取得合理的代价，同时实行计工取酬、按劳分红。按土地和按劳动分配收获物的比例，应根据社内各种成员的自愿和当地经济发展的条件而定。）
    这些农业生产合作社的组成与合作办法，虽各有不同，但都是组员赞成和满意的，社外群众见他们多打粮食，也表示羡慕。
    以上几种类型中，第一类第二类占大多数，第三类是少数，第四类是个别的。在农业生产的发展和提高上，农业互助合作组织的作用有这几方面：
    一、组织了互助合作，可以有计划地克服农业生产中的各种困难，合理地使用人力、畜力和农具等，从而逐步地克服小农经济的弱点。个体农民对于收麦、锄地、栽秧、车水等突击性的农事作业，往往很难应付。组织起来后，就可以根据各家耕作时间的先后，统一调配劳动力，缓急相帮，保证耕作及时。苏北陈维芳互助组去年麦收，因集体收割，比单干户提早一天半割完。个体农户除富农外，往往很难置全一整套的农具，尤其是大型农具，如水车、大车等。很多贫农是缺乏耕畜的。组织起来后，就可以实行人力与农具或畜力互换，有农具或有耕畜的和无农具或无耕畜的相帮，并能充分发挥现有的农具、耕畜的作用。
    二、组织了互助合作，可以节省劳动力，实行比较科学的劳动分工，避免劳动力的浪费。农民在单干时，各人劳动力有强弱，生产技术有高低，农忙时劳力不足，农闲时劳力有余。因此，一家一户的个体经营，浪费劳动力是很大的。组织起来后，在农忙时可以按各人劳动力的强弱和专长适当分工，使每个农民都能充分发挥作用；在农闲时，也可以组织剩余劳动力、资金、工具，经营其他生产。皖北吕东扬互助组，已开始实行分工分业，使每个组员各尽所能，在农忙时，仍可进行副业生产。浙江许桂荣互助组在秋收后，大部分劳动力即投入副业生产。各地很多互助组，在冬季积极兴修水利，从事积肥，为春季大生产作准备。凡是这方面搞得好的互助组，组员们的收入都超过单干农民。
    三、组织了互助合作，可以大大提高农民的生产积极性和劳动效率，能精耕细作，也便于从政治上教育农民，培养农民的集体观念，贯彻生产政策。正如苏北陈维芳互助组所提出的口号：“锄怕三张，牛怕两犋”，只要组织得好，人多干活情绪高，互相督促，越干越起劲，二人可抵三人。单干农民因为土地有限，往往不敢轻易进行自己所没有经历过的新的尝试，组织了互助合作，人多智广，在先进分子的推动下，便于克服保守思想，发挥集体智慧，研究和试行先进的耕作方法。山东宋世坤互助组组员郭永斌，过去从来不选种，不施肥，参加互助组后，在大家的影响下，前年种苞米也施了一百五十斤豆饼，地瓜和麦子换了良种，收成很好。他祖父说：“老脑筋是不行了，今后要想多打粮，得学新办法。”去年华东军政委员会“发展农业生产十大政策”颁布后，好多互助组都进行了反复的讨论，特别是爱国增产运动的号召提出来后，几乎所有的互助组都针对当地情况，从组到户订出了爱国增产计划；先进的互助组并向李顺达应战，进一步激发了农民的生产积极性。
    四、组织了互助合作，可以兴办个体农民所不能举办的事业，可以集体购买个体农民所买不起的新式农具，克服个体农民所不能克服的自然灾害。山东于松长互助组，用压沙办法改良了一百三十多亩地的土壤，并先后打了几十口井，使农作物的产量大大提高。山东吕鸿宾互助组，目前已拥有三张七吋步犁，四架解放式水车，三架喷雾器，二架玉米脱粒机。淮河沿岸的广大农村，由于组织了互助合作，因而能抽出大批劳动力参加治淮，使根治淮河的伟大任务能够逐步实现。去年在发生旱情的地区，好多互助组都组织了大批水车，解决了缺水的困难；在发生虫灾的地区，组织了群众集体扑灭了虫害，保证了禾苗的生长。
    除了上面说的几个主要作用外，组织互助合作还可以解决组员们生产上生活上的困难。如山东昆嵛县宋家沟村董崇华互助组组员宋福壮，过去是单干户，前年有病，去春缺口粮；参加互助组以后，同组的其他组员借给粮食度过了春荒；去年不仅生产及时，还赚了一百四十斤粮。再如苏北陈维芳互助组内某组员家中死了人，准备将二亩上等田卖了；后来组里借给粮食，解决了殡葬困难，没有卖地。去年七月，福建建阳县葛老五互助组组员陈发婢生病死了，丢下老婆孩子两人，生活困难。葛老五号召发扬阶级友爱，全组替死者买了棺材，还清了债务，并早早地帮他家割好五亩早稻，完成了秋种秋收。
    因为互助合作在农业生产中有上面这许多作用，所以凡是搞得好的互助组，组员们的农作物产量，都有了显著的增加。比较突出的山东吕鸿宾互助组，全组的产量不但已超过战前水平，且已接近耕一余一，吕本人已经超过耕一余一。即使是临时性季节性的互助组，在农业生产发展上的作用，也超过一般单干户；结合副业，提高耕作技术的常年互助，作用就更为显著。农业生产合作社在土地、农具、耕畜集中使用方面，有更显著的优越性。总之，凡是搞得比较好的互助组，农民的生产水平和生活水平都大大提高，有的度过了严重的灾荒，有的已有了余粮，并提高了农民的政治觉悟，养成了集体劳动的习惯；对懒汉二流子的改造，也起了很大作用。
