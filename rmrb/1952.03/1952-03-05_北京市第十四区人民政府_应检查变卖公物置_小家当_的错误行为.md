    The People's Government of the Fourteenth District of Beijing
    Should Examine the Mistaken Behavior of Selling Public Property to Acquire "Small Family Assets"

    To the Editor: In August 1951, the People's Government of the Fourteenth District of Beijing dismantled the broken bricks of the Niangniang Tomb (public property) in Caobali Village within the district and sold them for more than 13 million yuan. This money should have been turned over in full. However, they arbitrarily misappropriated more than 3.3 million yuan to build a "paved road" in the district; in addition, they misappropriated more than 8.6 million yuan to buy more than 70 pieces of furniture such as tables and chairs, as well as clocks, glass cabinets, cloth bags, and Jiangxi sea bowls. It was not until the end of 1951 that they turned over the remaining balance of more than 1 million yuan.

    I believe that the actions of the People's Government of the Fourteenth District in selling public property without seeking instructions and acquiring "small family assets" are violations of the financial system. The People's Government of the Fourteenth District should conduct an in-depth examination during the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    北京市第十四区人民政府
    应检查变卖公物置“小家当”的错误行为
    编辑同志：北京市第十四区人民政府在一九五一年八月间，拆除该区界内曹八里村娘娘坟（公产）的碎砖，变卖了一千三百多万元。这笔钱理应如数上缴。但他们竟擅自挪用三百三十多万元，在该区修筑了一条“甬路”；另外又挪用八百六十多万元，买了桌椅七十余件和钟表、玻璃柜、布包、江西海碗等。直到一九五一年底才把结余的尾款一百多万元上缴。
    我认为第十四区人民政府变卖公物不经请示，置办“小家当”的作法是违反财政制度的行为。第十四区人民政府应认真地在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动中深入检查。    志钧
