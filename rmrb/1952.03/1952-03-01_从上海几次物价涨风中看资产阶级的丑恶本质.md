    The Shanghai market, on which national commodity prices hinge, has been frantically disrupted countless times by illegal merchants since liberation. Although the People's Government and state-owned trading departments have won many victories in the fight against them and achieved basic price stability, the national economy and people's lives have suffered considerable losses as a result. In the successive struggles, the ugly essence of the bourgeoisie has been fully exposed.

    The attacks of illegal merchants in Shanghai on the national economy and the people's livelihood were most rampant in the period from Shanghai's liberation in May 1949 to the implementation of national financial and economic unification in March 1950. At that time, social production had not yet returned to normal, national finances had not yet stabilized, and the strength of state-owned trade was still small. Illegal merchants in Shanghai had organized large-scale and frenzied attacks on RMB and the prices of people's necessities.

    The attack on RMB was an attempt to subvert the new Chinese currency system, and it took half a year to basically quell it. Illegal merchants in Shanghai initially manipulated silver dollar speculation, depreciating the purchasing power of RMB and plundering the people's due living materials. In the early days of liberation – from June 2nd to 9th, 1949, within eight days, each silver dollar jumped from 660 RMB to more than 1,800 RMB, and prices therefore skyrocketed threefold within half a month. The leading illegal merchants used telephones to direct operations from the "Securities Building," then the center of speculation, dispatching large numbers of "scalpers" to spread rumors, buying low and selling high silver dollars, making noise everywhere. The price of silver dollars changed several times a day. Workers and staff members who received wages could originally exchange them for ten silver dollars, but the next day they could only exchange them for seven. When they exchanged them for use, the "scalpers" deducted one or two hundred RMB from each silver dollar, and the things they wanted to buy had increased by several percent. The Shanghai people, who suffered the barbaric plunder of illegal merchants, angrily rose up to assist the People's Government in searching the "Securities Building," arresting more than 200 profiteers, and eliminating open silver dollar speculation. However, illegal merchants in Shanghai quickly went underground and continued to disrupt finances. Many shops, banks, and money shops secretly bought and sold gold and US dollars, privately offered loans at high interest rates, and illegally exchanged foreign exchange. Some profiteers, such as Yuanda Cloth Shop and Huashengxin Cotton Cloth Shop, even refused to price goods in RMB. RMB continued to be artificially devalued, and prices continued to skyrocket. With the assistance of the people, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government cracked 350 "gold and banknote cases" within half a year, searched more than 20 "underground money shops," sanctioned more than 50 illegal banks and shops, and confiscated more than 200,000 taels of gold and more than 19,000 US dollars. These punished banks and shops and confiscated gold and banknotes are only a part of the group engaged in subversive activities, but they are enough to illustrate the extent of the rampant activities of illegal merchants in Shanghai at that time.

    Although the financial speculation of illegal merchants in Shanghai has been resolutely countered by the People's Government and the broad masses of the people, their impact on the prices of people's necessities is still very fierce. These are the three price hikes led by rice prices in July, November 1949, and the Spring Festival of 1950 that the people of Shanghai cannot forget. The most vicious elements among the illegal merchants in Shanghai shouted arrogantly "Eat tuo nong! (Eat you up!)" meaning to defeat the state-owned trade that had just entered the market. The remnants of the famous "Rice Tiger" Wan Molin publicly said: "Without us, there is no way for Shanghai to get food!" There were disasters in 1949, and the mainland liberation war was still going on. The People's Government transferred rice from faraway Northeast China and even Sichuan and sold it on the market without restriction. However, much of it was taken away by the "rice tigers." The first time illegal merchants in Shanghai took advantage of the state-owned trading departments' failure to schedule in time to hoard and refuse to sell, and on July 16, they raised the price of rice to eleven times that of the end of June. The second time, they saw that the state-owned trading departments had weaker control over retail, and organized forces to swallow the rice sold by state-owned grain companies in the market. Although the amount of rice sold by state-owned grain companies for several days exceeded the city's normal daily needs, such as on November 7, the amount sold exceeded the normal need by more than one time, and the price per picul was 58,000 RMB, the illegal merchants still raised the retail price that day to about 80,000 RMB, and on the 16th, they raised it to 160,000 RMB. The state-owned grain company then adopted the method of implementing special retail sales in more than 100 rice shops to contain their retail prices. The broad masses of citizens who could not bear the exploitation of the profiteers cheered "The state's rice is sold at a fair price!" and went to the special rice shops to buy rice. However, the illegal merchants sent a large number of "scalpers" to line up and snap up, and some special rice shops卑劣地偷换、盗窃国营公司的米, sabotaged the state-owned retail business. The third time, the price hike during the Spring Festival lasted longer, and the state-owned grain company suffered a great loss, selling an average of 75% of the actual transaction volume in the market every day. It was not until a large number of state-owned retail stores were opened to directly supply food for the people that the price hike was gradually suppressed.

    It is worth noting that neither financial speculation nor speculation in essential commodities is the sole action of a few illegal elements in the relevant industries. There is no need to prove that speculators in silver dollars, gold and banknotes are everywhere in all walks of life; in terms of speculation in essential commodities for people's livelihood, many examples can also be picked at random. Hengli and Dazhong banks, the illegal banks engaged in financial speculation, the former had collected customer deposits to participate in the cotton yarn merchants' activity of套购 state-owned cotton yarn and raised yarn prices in July 1949, and the latter colluded with a large number of rice merchants through "Dasheng Trading Company" to participate in the destructive activity of raising rice prices. During the rice price hikes in July and November, the number of rice merchants in Shanghai increased significantly. Guo Yongqing, a profiteer of Xinlaodafang Confectionery, actively participated in the snap-up in November and even改装 the confectionery into "Jinghu Rice Shop" overnight. The bosses of Yuxing and Zhonghui rice shops, which made waves in the rice market, are both famous gold and US dollar speculation profiteers, and the latter is also the person in charge of "Tao Tao Xiangdao Society," the largest prostitution organization in Shanghai at that time.

    These facts are sufficient to prove that the activities of subverting the national currency system, attacking state-owned trade departments, and attempting to continue肆意掠夺 the broad masses of the people are general activities of many illegal elements in the Shanghai bourgeoisie. Moreover, the repeated speculative activities of silver dollars, gold and banknotes, and food rice are sufficient to prove that their attacks are organized and planned.

    Perhaps some people will defend that the national finances were not stable at that time, and the currency was still inflating, and it was not entirely the making of profiteers? Then let's take a look at the actions of the profiteers after the national unification of finance and economy in March 1950, when the currency was stabilized. Many merchants in Shanghai are unwilling to engage in normal profit operations. They are unwilling to stand together with price stability. Over the past two years, they have still not relaxed their attacks on every market gap. In May 1950, state-owned department stores ordered a large number of underwear from private underwear weaving industry, and illegal merchants took the opportunity to refuse to sell the raw material for underwear, six-count coarse yarn, thus creating the historically rare "miracle" that the price of six-count coarse yarn was higher than that of 20-count yarn. In the autumn of 1950, when the rural areas had a bumper harvest, illegal merchants in Shanghai colluded with grain merchants from other places to drill into the rural areas and bid down the price of early rice. Farmers in various counties in Zhenjiang area of Southern Jiangsu Province only sold each catty of rice for more than 400 RMB, which was one-third lower than the state-owned price.

    These examples are endless.

    In June 1950, American imperialists invaded Korea, occupied Taiwan, and stepped up their economic blockade against our country. Many illegal merchants in Shanghai, as Gu Jialing, the person in charge of Dade Chemical Factory who recently confessed his crimes, said, "I saw that the opportunity to make a fortune through speculation had come again." The two sugar price hikes that everyone knows about were the result of organized sabotage led by Cheng Shunkang, Li Meiquan and other main persons in charge of the sugar industry trade association. They stole economic intelligence from state-owned companies and jointly 套购 state-owned company sugar in order to篡夺 the leadership of sugar prices. The inside stories of the several price hikes of chemical, hardware and other raw materials and equipment have also been seen in some cases revealed in this anti-profiteering struggle. Illegal merchants in Shanghai colluded with speculators in Hong Kong to create multiple price hikes. When state-owned companies imported large quantities of hardware equipment and chemical raw materials with the help of the Soviet Union and new democratic countries to supply the market, illegal merchants turned around and undermined the price list.

    Price speculation in the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea is not limited to imported goods. Illegal merchants in Shanghai also frantically attacked the price of coal, one of the daily necessities of the people, in October 1950. At that time, state-owned companies changed to supply Jiaozuo white coal because it was inconvenient to transport Yangquan white coal. Illegal merchants snapped up white coal and hoarded it and refused to sell it. Zhu Daozhong, a profiteer from Huatong Coal Shop, spread rumors everywhere, saying: "The coal company has stopped supplying." Within a few days, the retail price of Yangquan white coal was哄涨 by about one time. Coal ball manufacturers also took the opportunity to raise the price by one-third, and at one time even made it impossible for citizens to buy coal balls.

    Speculation in imported materials and other daily necessities is not only the individual action of a few illegal merchants in the relevant industries. Jukangxing Money Shop hoarded 100 barrels of caustic soda in the name of "investment in production." Rentai Rice Shop and Meifeng Cigarette Shop also actively participated in the hoarding during the white coal price hike. These are very common examples.

    从上海几次物价涨风中看资产阶级的丑恶本质
    新华社记者  徐中尼
    全国物价所系的上海市场，解放以来受到不法商人无数次猖狂的扰乱。人民政府和国营贸易部门在和他们斗争中虽然打了很多胜仗，取得了物价基本稳定的局面。但是国家经济和人民生活因此受到不少损失。在历次斗争中，充分暴露了资产阶级的丑恶本质。
    上海不法商人对国家经济和人民生活的进攻，在一九四九年五月上海解放到一九五○年三月全国实行财经统一的一段时期中最为猖獗。当时社会生产还未恢复正常，国家财政还未稳定，国营贸易的力量还小。上海不法商人曾大规模地组织了对人民币和人民生活必需品价格的疯狂冲击。
    对人民币的冲击，是一次对新中国币制的颠覆活动，先后半年才基本上被平息。上海不法商人开始是操纵银元投机，贬低人民币的购买力，掠夺人民应得的生活资料。在刚解放时——一九四九年六月二日到九日八天内，每枚银元从折换人民币六百六十元跳到一千八百多元，物价因此在半个月内暴涨三倍。为首的不法商人在当时的投机中心“证券大楼”用电话指挥，派出大批“黄牛”四出造谣，低收高卖银元，满街满巷叮叮当当地兴风作浪。银元价格一天几变。工人职员们领到的工资原可换十枚银元，第二天只能换到七枚了。等到兑出使用时，“黄牛”又每枚扣去他一二百元，要买的东西却又涨了几成价。遭受不法商人野蛮掠夺的上海人民，愤怒地起来协助人民政府抄查了“证券大楼”，逮捕了二百多名奸商，消灭了公开的银元投机活动。但是上海不法商人迅速转入地下继续破坏金融。许多商号、银行、钱庄都在暗中买卖黄金、美钞，私营拆放，高抬暗息，私套外汇。有些奸商如源大布号、华盛新棉布号等，甚至拒绝以人民币作价。人民币被继续人为地贬值，物价继续跳涨。上海市人民政府在人民群众协助下半年内先后破获了“金钞案”三百五十件，搜查了二十多家“地下钱庄”，制裁了五十多家不法行庄，没收黄金二十多万两和美钞一万九千多元。这些被惩处的行庄和没收的金钞数字仅是从事颠覆活动的集团中的一部分，但已足够说明上海不法商人当时猖獗的程度了。
    上海不法商人的金融投机虽然连续受到人民政府和广大人民的坚决反击，但是他们对人民生活必需品价格的冲击仍是很凶狠的。这就是上海人民忘不了的一九四九年七月、十一月、一九五○年春节三次以米价为先导的物价涨风。上海不法商人中最凶恶的分子狂妄地叫嚣“吃脱侬（吃掉你）！”意即要打垮刚刚进入市场的国营贸易。著名“米老虎”万墨林的余孽们公开说：“没有我们，上海的粮食就没有办法！”一九四九年有灾荒，大陆解放战争还在进行。人民政府从遥远的东北、甚至从四川调来了大米在市场上无限制地抛售。但其中有不少却被“米老虎”套购去了。上海不法商人第一次是趁国营贸易部门调度不及的机会囤积拒售，在七月十六日把米价哄抬到六月底时的十一倍。第二次他们看准国营贸易部门对零售控制较弱，组织力量整个地吞下国营粮食公司在市场上抛售的米。虽然国营粮食公司好几天抛售的米量超过全市每日正常的需要量，如十一月七日抛售量超过正常需要一倍以上，每石售价是五万八千元，但不法商人吞下后仍把当天零售价提高到八万元左右，到十六日竟抬到十六万元。国营粮食公司接着采取在一百多家米店实行特约零售的办法，牵制他们的零售价。受不了奸商剥削的广大市民欢呼“国家的米平粜了”，齐到特约米店去买米。但不法商人派出大批“黄牛”去排队抢购，一部分特约米店并卑劣地偷换、盗窃国营公司的米，破坏国营零售业务。第三次在春节的涨风延续日期更长，国营粮食公司损耗很大，平均每天抛售了市场实际成交量的百分之七十五。一直到大批开设了国营零售店直接供应民食，才渐渐把涨风抑平下来。
    值得注意的是：无论金融投机或民生必需商品的投机，并不是有关行业中少数不法分子的单独行动。银元、金钞等投机犯遍及各行各业是毋需证明的；在民生必需商品的投机方面，也可以随便拣出许多例子。从事金融投机的不法银行恒利和大中两家，前者曾抽集客户存款参加一九四九年七月的棉纱商套购国营棉纱并哄抬纱价的活动，后者通过“大生贸易行”勾结了大批米商参加哄抬米价的破坏活动。七月、十一月米价涨风中，上海米商业户曾大量发展。新老大房糖果店奸商郭永庆在十一月积极参加抢购，曾连夜把糖果店改装成“京沪米店”。在米市场中兴风作浪的大米行裕盛、中汇两家的老板都是著名的黄金、美钞投机奸商，后者还是当时上海最大的卖淫组织“陶陶向导社”的主持人。
    这些事实都足以证明：颠覆国家币制、进攻国营贸易部门，企图达到继续肆意掠夺广大人民的活动，是上海资产阶级中许多不法分子一般性的活动。而且从银元、金钞、食米等此伏彼起接二连三的投机活动中也足以证明：他们的进攻是有组织有计划的。
    也许有人会辩护：当时国家财政还未稳定，通货还在膨胀，不完全是奸商的兴风作浪吧？那就看一看一九五○年三月全国实行统一财经，通货从此稳定后奸商们的作为吧。上海许多商人不愿从事正常利润的经营，他们和物价稳定是不肯两立的，两年来仍然毫不放松向每一次市场的空隙袭击。一九五○年五月，国营百货公司向私营内衣织造业定购大批内衣，不法商人便乘机拒售内衣原料六支粗纱，因此制造了历史上罕有的六支粗纱价格高过二十支纱的“奇迹”。一九五○年秋农村丰收，上海不法商人便伙同外埠粮商钻入农村，杀价收购早稻。苏南镇江一带各县农民每斤大米只售得四百多元，低于国营牌价三分之一。
    这些事例是列举不完的。
    一九五○年六月，美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜、强占台湾、加紧对我国经济封锁，上海许多不法商人正如最近坦白自己罪行的大德化学厂负责人顾嘉龄所说的一样：“我看中投机发财的机会又到了。”大家都知道的两次糖价涨风，就是以糖商业同业公会的主要负责人程顺康、李梅泉等为首有组织地进行破坏的结果。他们盗窃国营公司的经济情报，合力套购国营公司食糖以篡夺糖价的领导权。化工、五金等原料器材的几次涨风的内幕，人们也在这次反奸商斗争揭露的一些案件中看到了。上海不法商人和香港的投机家勾结一起，制造了多次涨风。当国营公司在苏联和新民主主义国家帮助下进口大批五金器材、化工原料供应市场时，不法商人们就反过来破坏牌价。
    抗美援朝中的物价投机，并不限于进口货。上海不法商人在一九五○年十月份又疯狂地向人民日用必需商品之一的煤的价格袭击。当时国营公司因运输阳泉白煤不便，改供焦作白煤。不法商人就群起抢购白煤，囤积拒售。华通煤号奸商朱道中等到处造谣说：“煤业公司停止供应了。”几天内把阳泉白煤的零售价哄涨约一倍。煤球厂商也乘机抬价三分之一，甚至一度使市民买不到煤球。
    进口物资和其他民生日用品的投机，也不仅是有关行业中少数不法商人的个别行动。聚康兴钱庄假借“投资生产”为名囤积了烧碱一百桶。仁泰米店和美丰纸烟店在白煤涨风中也积极参加囤购。这些都是很寻常的例子。
