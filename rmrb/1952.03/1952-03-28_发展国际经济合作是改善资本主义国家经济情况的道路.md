    Developing International Economic Cooperation is the Path to Improving the Economic Situation of Capitalist Countries
    Pei Shan
    The International Economic Conference scheduled to be held in Moscow on April 3rd has aroused widespread and enthusiastic response around the world. Industrialists, businessmen, agriculturalists, technicians, cooperative workers, trade union workers, economists, and the broad masses of people from various countries have placed great hopes on this conference. The reason why this conference has aroused such a broad response is that the current international economic relations are extremely abnormal, endangering the living standards of the people of most countries.
    One
    The reason for the deteriorating economic situation in capitalist countries is primarily due to the fact that the economies of various countries have been shifted onto a war economy track. Stalin, in his analysis of the development laws of the war economy of Germany and Japan before World War II in 1939, said: "To put the domestic economy on a wartime economic track means to develop industry along a one-sided military trend, to vigorously expand the production of those goods that are specifically for war needs and have nothing to do with residents' consumption, to vigorously reduce the production of residents' consumer goods, especially to reduce the sale of residents' consumer goods, thereby reducing the amount of residents' consumption and plunging the country into an economic crisis." (Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the 18th Party Congress on March 10, 1939) Currently, capitalist countries are advancing along this track towards the path of economic crisis.
    The US imperialists began preparing for war shortly after the end of World War II. After launching the aggressive Korean War, they carried out military expansion and war preparations on an even larger scale. At the same time, the US government also forced its vassal states to prepare for war through the North Atlantic Treaty, military agreements, the Marshall Plan, and other means. According to statistics from "For a Lasting Peace, For a People's Democracy!", the military expenditure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in 1951-1952 totaled $190 billion. Of the total expenditure of $85.444 billion in the US budget for 1952-1953, direct and indirect military expenditure amounted to $65.088 billion; adding war-related expenses, the total reached $75.541 billion, accounting for 88.4 percent of the total expenditure. The total amount of the British three-year military plan is 4.7 billion pounds. The total budget of the United Kingdom in 1951-1952 was 4.197 billion pounds, and military expenditure has reached 1.49 billion pounds (later added to 1.7 billion pounds), accounting for one-third of the budget expenditure and 8 percent of the national income. The preliminary military budget proposed for 1952-1953 is more than 1.46 billion pounds. The total amount of France's two-year military expansion plan is 2 trillion francs. Military expenditure in 1951-1952 has reached 1.1 trillion francs, and the preliminary military budget proposed for 1952-1953 is 1.4 trillion francs. The total amount of Italy's three-year military expansion plan is 1.5 trillion lira, and military expenditure in 1951-1952 reached 625 billion lira. Military expansion and war preparations have become a common phenomenon in Western Europe, Northern Europe, the Americas, and other countries. Huge budgets inevitably increase the burden on the people. US taxes in October 1951 increased by 55.1 compared to the first quarter of 1950. All taxes in 1951-1952 accounted for 36 percent of the national income. British taxes account for 45 percent of national income (national income is calculated according to the British and American calculation methods, in which there are repetitions, so the proportion of taxes should be higher). According to statistics from the American "Outlook" magazine, during the six years and two months of Truman's tenure, taxes totaling $277 billion were collected, which is $21 billion more than the taxes collected by the 31 presidents in the past 156 years since the founding of the United States. Truman has been called the "largest tax collector in American history." Public debt is increasing rapidly: US public debt in 1951 was no less than $260 billion, British public debt exceeded 30 billion pounds, France reached more than 4 trillion francs, and Italy reached 2.8 trillion lira. Inflation and credit expansion are becoming more intense. In the year after the Korean War, the cost of living in the United States and the United Kingdom rose by 25 percent; prices in France rose by 36 percent, and prices in Japan rose by 65 percent. Huge budgets plunder the people through taxes or inflation, which further deprives the people of their purchasing power. Therefore, even after a large reduction in the production of civilian industries, there is still a phenomenon of supply exceeding demand. US inventories in July 1951 reached $70.3 billion, an increase of 32 percent compared to $53.2 billion in July 1950.
    Wilson, the director of the US Defense Mobilization Agency, openly shouted the slogan of replacing butter with cannons. Military industry is expanding rapidly. As the London "Economist" magazine said, the "killing industry" has replaced the peaceful industry, disrupting the entire process of reproduction.
    Military production requires a large amount of materials. As the American "Business Week" admitted, in 1951, 11 percent of the US national steel production, 20 percent of copper production, and 30 percent of aluminum production were directly used for military production. The expansion of military production has led to the shrinking of civilian industry. In 1951, although military production orders in the United States increased quarter by quarter, the overall production index was still declining due to the faster decline in civilian industry. The US total production index in 1951 fell from 223 in April and May to 218 in November; the textile industry fell from 194 in January 1951 to 155 in October; food production fell from 168 in January 1951 to 162 in September. The production of radio receivers, televisions, refrigerators, household appliances, textiles, and shoes has been reduced. The housing construction, textile, footwear, household appliance, and even machinery manufacturing industries in the United Kingdom have been forced to reduce production, thereby affecting the export of British hardware (accounting for 40 percent of exports) and textiles. The production of textiles, footwear, leather, tobacco, and metal products in the Netherlands has also decreased. The reduction in the production of civilian industries (especially the textile industry) and the increase in worker unemployment have become a common phenomenon in capitalist countries.
    Stalin pointed out in his interview with a Pravda reporter in February 1951: "Increasing the army and engaging in the expansion of armaments will expand the military industry, reduce the civilian industry, halt huge civilian construction projects, increase taxes, and increase the prices of consumer goods." This is the most profound analysis of the current economic crisis in capitalist countries.
    Two
    Another main reason for the deterioration of the economic situation in capitalist countries is the monopoly of the US imperialists over the markets of capitalist countries. This monopoly has made international economic relations increasingly worse. The United States has used "military aid" and other means to monopolize the markets of capitalist countries; through the conditions attached to US loans, it has made these countries lose their tariff autonomy and trade freedom, gradually losing their political and economic independence, and becoming the US's exclusive market for selling surplus goods. The United States not only sells surplus military goods to these countries, but also sells surplus goods of various kinds to destroy the industries of these countries. After the Korean War, US monopoly capital moved from monopolizing the market to monopolizing raw materials, and to this end, it forced its vassal states to sign international agreements on wheat, sugar, etc.; and convened international raw material conferences on wool, cotton, paper and pulp, manganese, lead, rubber, etc., to ensure that the United States obtains a large and cheap supply of raw materials. China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries advocate equal and mutually beneficial international trade between countries. China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries are important countries for purchasing commodities and raw materials in the world, and at the same time, they are important countries for exporting commodities, food, and raw materials in the world. They occupy a pivotal position in the international market and can improve the industrial and agricultural production of several countries. However, US monopoly capital monopolizes the international market for selfish purposes. Therefore, the United States uses various means to prevent its servant countries from breaking off trade relations with China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. However, facts have proved that the blockade and embargo have little impact on China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries, because our industry and agriculture have developed, we have abundant domestic resources, and we have greatly developed trade between each other. The blockade and embargo have had a great impact on capitalist countries. For example, Western Europe, Northern Europe, the Americas, and Japan have long-term trade relations with China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. They sell industrial equipment and chemical raw materials to us, and at the same time purchase our food (soybeans, eggs, peanuts, etc.), industrial raw materials, fuel, and wood. However, due to the embargo, these countries have suffered great losses. For another example, many countries in Asia, Central and South America, Africa, and Australia produce many of the world's important raw materials, such as rubber, wool, cotton, oil, copper, lead, tin, aluminum, cobalt, cocoa, and coconut. After the embargo, the United States has become the most important raw material buyer for these countries. However, because the United States manipulates prices, purchases at low prices, and does not supply them with industrial equipment, grain, and industrial products, after these countries export in large quantities, their currencies tend to inflate, prices rise, and the living standards of the people decline.
    Three
    The crisis led by the domestic war economy in capitalist countries and the destruction of international economic relations by US imperialism have caused the deterioration of the current economic situation in capitalist countries.
    Only a few US monopoly capitalists benefit from the war economy and blockade and embargo. In 1951, the profits of US companies almost doubled compared to 1950. Their pre-tax profits will exceed $60 billion; Morgan's "General Electric Company," which manufactures atomic bombs, doubled its profits, and DuPont Chemical Trust, which manufactures hydrogen bombs, also made double profits. Small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, the broad masses of workers and peasants suffer losses. The bankruptcy of small and medium-sized enterprises has greatly increased the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed workers in various countries. In 1951, the number of unemployed workers in various countries reached more than 45 million. In the four years from June 1948 to June 1951, the increase in unemployed workers was: three and a half times in Belgium, one and a half times in Italy, three times in Norway, Denmark, and West Germany, and seven times in Austria. People's living standards have been further reduced: the Joint Committee of the US Congress Economic Report admitted in August 1951 that a quarter of American families rely on eating potatoes and stale bread to live. In the recently announced fiscal budget for 1952-1953, the British Conservative government decided to cut 160 million pounds in food subsidies used to stabilize food prices, accounting for nearly one-third of the original total. This will undoubtedly further reduce and worsen the living standards of the British people. In Asian, African, and Latin American countries, prices are rising even faster: the cost of living in Iran has risen seven times compared to before the war, and food prices in Mexico rose by 60 to 100 percent in the first ten months of 1951, and the people's living standards have been severely reduced.
    Therefore, apart from a few monopoly capitalists, industrialists, businessmen, agriculturalists, cooperative workers, trade union workers, and the broad masses of people all over the world have recognized that military expansion and war preparations, blockade, and embargo are the reasons for the increasingly serious economic crisis. Even the American "New York Herald Tribune" cannot but admit that military expansion and war preparations have put some countries at risk of economic collapse.
    The International Economic Conference calls for the development of international economic cooperation under peaceful conditions, bringing new hope to the people of all countries. Opposing blockade and embargo, and widely developing international trade will further guarantee the possibility of peaceful coexistence among countries in the world, deal a greater blow to the military expansion of US imperialism and its servant countries, and facilitate the transition of these countries' economies from a war economy to a peaceful economy. This explains why convening the International Economic Conference can win the enthusiastic support of the people of the world.

    发展国际经济合作是改善资本主义国家经济情况的道路
    佩山
    定于四月三日在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议，已经引起全世界广泛的热烈反应。各国工业家、商业家、农业家、技术人员、合作社工作者、工会工作者、经济学家以及广大人民，都对这个会议寄予极大的期望。这个会议之所以引起广泛的反应，是由于目前国际经济关系已经极端不正常，使多数国家人民的生活水准受到危害。一
    目前资本主义国家经济情势恶化的原因，首先由于各国经济已经转到战争经济的轨道。斯大林在一九三九年分析第二次世界大战以前德国、日本备战经济的发展规律时说：“把国内经济转上战时经济轨道，就是使工业循着片面的军事的趋向发展，极力扩大专供战争需要而与居民消费无关的那些物品的生产，极力缩小居民消费品的生产，特别是缩小居民消费品的出售，因此减缩居民的消费额，使国家陷入经济危机。”（一九三九年三月十日在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告）目前资本主义国家正在循着这一轨道向经济危机的道路前进。
    美帝国主义在第二次世界大战结束以后不久，就开始进行战争准备。它在发动侵略朝鲜战争以后，更大规模地进行扩军备战。同时，美国政府还通过北大西洋公约、军事协定、马歇尔计划等方式，强迫它的仆从国家进行战争准备。据“争取人民民主，争取持久和平！”的统计，一九五一年——一九五二年度北大西洋公约国家的军事费用一共花费了一千九百亿美元。美国一九五二年——一九五三年预算的支出总额八百五十四亿四千四百万美元中，直接间接军费达六百五十亿八千八百万美元；再加上与战争有关费用，共达七百五十五亿四千一百万美元，占支出总额的百分之八十八点四。英国三年军事计划总额为四十七亿英镑，一九五一年——一九五二年度英国总预算为四十一亿九千七百万镑，军事费用已达十四亿九千万镑（后追加为十七亿镑），占预算支出的三分之一，占国民收入的百分之八，一九五二年——一九五三年军事预算初步已提出十四亿六千余万镑。法国两年扩军计划总额二万亿法郎，一九五一年——一九五二年军费支出已达一万一千亿法郎，一九五二年——一九五三年度军费预算初步提出为一万四千亿法郎。意大利三年扩军计划总额为一万五千亿里拉，一九五一年——一九五二年度军费达六千二百五十亿里拉。扩军备战已经成为西欧、北欧、美洲各国共同的现象。庞大的预算必然增加人民的负担。美国一九五一年十月的捐税较一九五零年第一季增加了五十五点一，一九五一年——一九五二年度全部捐税为国民收入的百分之三十六。英国捐税则占国民收入的百分之四十五（国民收入是按英美的计算方法计算的，其中有重复的地方，因此捐税所占比重应该更高）。据美国“展望”杂志统计，杜鲁门在执政六年又两个月当中，征税共达二千七百七十亿美元，比过去美国开国以来一百五十六年内三十一个总统所征的捐税，还要多出二百一十亿美元。杜鲁门已被称为美国“历史上最大的税吏”。公债迅速增加：一九五一年的美国公债不下于二千六百亿美元，英国公债超过三百亿英镑，法国达四万亿法郎以上，意大利达二万八千亿里拉。通货膨胀和信用膨胀更加剧烈，朝鲜战争后一年中，美国和英国的生活费用都上升了百分之二十五；法国物价上升了百分之三十六，日本物价上升了百分之六十五。庞大的预算，通过税收或通货膨胀去掠夺人民，其结果进一步剥夺了人民的购买力，因此，即使民用工业大量减产以后，仍然有供过于求的现象。一九五一年七月美国的存货达七百零三亿美元，较一九五零年七月的五百三十二亿美元增加了百分之三十二。
    美国的国防动员署署长威尔逊公开地叫出了以大炮代牛油的口号，军事工业急速地扩张。正如伦敦“经济学人”杂志所说，“杀人工业”代替了和平的工业，打乱了整个再生产的过程。
    军事生产需要大量的物资，正如美国“商业周刊”所承认的，一九五一年美国全国钢产量的百分之十一、铜产量的百分之二十、铝产量的百分之三十，已直接用于军事生产。军事生产的扩大导致了民用工业的萎缩。一九五一年美国尽管军事生产订单逐季增加，但是由于民用工业下降更速，总的生产指数仍在下降。美国一九五一年总生产指数自四、五月份的二二三降为十一月份的二一八；纺织工业从一九五一年一月至十月，由一九四降为一五五；食品生产从一九五一年一月至九月，由一六八降为一六二。无线电收音机、电视机、冷藏器、家用器具、纺织品、鞋类等产量都已降低。英国的房屋建筑和纺织、鞋靴、家用器具以至机器制造等工业，都被迫减产，因此影响了英国的五金（占出口的百分之四十）和纺织品的输出。荷兰的纺织、鞋靴、皮革、烟草、金属制品也减少了生产。民用工业（尤其是纺织工业）生产的减少和工人失业的增加，已成为资本主义国家的共同现象了。
    斯大林在一九五一年二月对真理报记者的谈话中指出：“增加军队和从事扩张军备，就使得军事工业扩大，民用工业减缩，使巨大的民用建设工程停顿，赋税增加，消费品价格上涨。”这就是对资本主义国家目前经济危机的最深刻的分析。二
    目前资本主义国家经济情势恶化的另一主要原因，是美帝国主义对于资本主义国家市场的垄断，这种垄断使国际经济关系日益恶劣。美国曾经通过“军事援助”等方式，来垄断资本主义国家的市场；通过美国贷款的附有条件，使这些国家的关税失去自主，贸易失去自由，使其逐步丧失政治和经济的独立，而成为美国推销剩余商品的独占市场。美国不仅向这些国家推销剩余军火，而且推销了剩余的各种商品，来摧毁这些国家的工业。朝鲜战争以后，美国独占资本由垄断市场进而垄断原料，为此强迫各附庸国与它签订关于小麦、糖等的国际协定；并召开关于羊毛、棉花、纸和纸浆、锰、铅、橡胶等的国际性的原料会议，以保证美国获得大量而便宜的原料供应。中国、苏联和各人民民主国家，则主张各国之间进行平等互利的国际贸易。中国、苏联和人民民主国家是世界上重要的商品和原料的购买国家，同时又是世界上重要的商品、粮食和原料的输出国家，在国际市场上占有举足轻重的地位，能够使若干国家的工业和农业生产的情况得到改善。可是美国独占资本为了自私的目的对国际市场加以垄断。因此，美国就使用各种手段，阻止它的仆从国家和中国、苏联和各人民民主国家断绝贸易关系。但是，事实证明，封锁，禁运对于中国、苏联和各人民民主国家影响很小，因为我们的工业和农业已经发展，国内拥有丰富的资源，而且大大发展了相互之间的贸易。封锁、禁运对于资本主义国家影响却是很大，例如西欧、北欧、美洲和日本，对于中国、苏联和各人民民主国家有长期的贸易关系，它们向我们推销工业器材、化学原料等货物，同时购买我们的食物（大豆、蛋品、花生等）、工业原料、燃料和木材；然而由于禁运，这些国家就遭受了很大的损失。又如亚洲、中南美洲、非洲和澳洲的许多国家生产许多世界上重要的原料，如橡胶、羊毛、棉花、石油、铜、铅、锡、铝、钴、可可和椰子，在禁运以后，对于这些国家美国就成为最重要的原料购买者。然而，由于美国操纵价格，压价收购，同时对于它们并不供给工业设备、粮食和工业产品，使这些国家大量输出之后，通货趋于膨胀，物价日益高涨，人民生活水准日益降低。三资本主义国家由国内战时经济所导引的危机和美帝国主义对于国际经济关系的破坏，已经造成目前资本主义国家经济情况的恶化。
    在战时经济和封锁、禁运中，获得利益的仅仅是美国少数独占资本家。一九五一年美国各公司的利润几乎达到一九五零年的一倍半，他们在纳税前的利润将超过六百亿美元；制造原子弹的摩根的“通用电气公司”的利润增加了一倍，制造氢弹的杜邦化学托辣斯也获得了加倍的利润。遭受损失的是中小企业家、广大的工人和农民。中小企业的破产，使各国工人失业和半失业人数大大增加，一九五一年各国工人失业人数已达四千五百万人以上。从一九四八年六月到一九五一年六月为止的四年中，失业工人的增加：比利时为三倍半，意大利为一倍半，挪威、丹麦和西德为三倍，奥地利为七倍。人民生活水准已经更加降低：美国国会经济报告联合委员会一九五一年八月承认：美国四分之一的家庭是依靠吃马铃薯和陈面包生活。英国保守党政府在最近宣布的一九五二—一九五三年度的财政预算中，又决定削减用来稳定食物价格的食物津贴一亿六千万镑，占原来总数将近三分之一。这无疑将使英国人民的生活水准进一步降低和恶化。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的国家中，物价上升更速：伊朗的生活费用已较战前上涨了七倍，墨西哥的粮食在一九五一年前十个月就上涨了百分之六十至一百，人民生活水准已严重地降低。
    因此，目前除了少数独占资本家外，全世界的工业家、商业家、农业家、合作社工作者、工会工作者和广大人民，已经认识扩军备战、封锁、禁运是目前经济危机日趋严重的原因。连美国的“纽约先锋论坛报”也不能不承认：扩军备战已使若干国家面临经济崩溃的危险。
    国际经济会议号召在和平条件下发展国际经济合作，给各国人民带来了新的希望。反对封锁、禁运，以广泛开展国际贸易，将进一步保证世界各国和平共处的可能，使美帝国主义及其仆从国家扩张军备受到更大的打击，并便利争取这些国家的经济由战时经济转入和平经济的轨道。这就说明了召开国际经济会议为什么能获得世界人民热烈拥护的原因。
