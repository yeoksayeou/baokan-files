    Take Practical Actions to Oppose the American Aggressors' Germ Warfare

    The heinous American aggressors, in violation of international conventions and human morality, are conducting germ warfare in Korea and in the Northeastern and Qingdao areas of Shandong Province in our country, arousing extreme indignation among the people of China and the world. Following the solemn statement by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and the strong protests of various democratic parties, all organizations, groups, schools, factories, rural areas, and even religious organizations, have unanimously condemned the American aggressors, demanding the most severe sanctions against the germ warfare criminals. The China Peace Committee has also organized an "Investigation Team on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by U.S. Imperialism" to conduct on-the-spot investigations in Northeast China and on the Korean front. These actions demonstrate the determination of the Chinese people to defend world peace and defeat the germ warfare being waged by U.S. imperialism.

    Beyond these actions, what else should we do? In their protests against the bacteriological warfare waged by U.S. imperialism, the democratic parties of our country called on the people of the whole country to continue to strengthen the just action of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, thoroughly complete the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and further practice increasing production and practicing economy, so as to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and give the germ warfare criminals a devastating blow. This is the work we should be doing at present. In addition to intensifying the work of eliminating germs and preventing epidemics in and near areas where the enemy is spreading germs, we should make earnest efforts in the following aspects:

    First, we must continue to strengthen the current political education and patriotic education for the people of the whole country, and enhance the people's patriotic enthusiasm; constantly raise the people's understanding that American imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people and their hatred for American imperialism. This is an important driving force for promoting all work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and construction work. Relaxing this work will make the people politically blind and paralyzed, and lose their vigilance. At present, the circulation of newspapers in some areas has decreased, and some people do not read newspapers or care about current affairs, which is a manifestation of political paralysis. We cannot stop reading newspapers because we emphasize economy. Where this phenomenon occurs, it should be corrected quickly.

    Second, concentrate our efforts to carry the struggle against corruption and theft to the end, thoroughly eliminate all corruption and theft, plug all loopholes that can be exploited by corruption and theft elements, so that we can effectively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy throughout the country, and ensure that the results of the people's increased production and economy are not stolen, but are all turned into a force to strengthen the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, support the People's Volunteers, and become a force for national defense construction and economic construction, and a force for improving the people's lives. There are still many corrupt and thieving elements who are stubbornly resisting the struggle against corruption and theft in various ways, trying to muddle through and continue to do evil; we must strengthen the firepower of the attack and take all necessary measures to completely destroy the bunkers of all die-hard lawbreakers, forcing them to surrender completely.

    Third, do a good job in production. The spring plowing and drought prevention and resistance work that has already begun should be strengthened by drawing necessary cadres to strengthen leadership, and must be done well, and strive for patriotic and abundant production. In factories, where the "Three-Anti" movement has basically ended, the leadership should use most of its energy to lead production; where the "Three-Anti" movement is underway, it should draw as much necessary force as possible to lead production activities to ensure the completion of the 1952 production increase and savings plan. Not only must we maintain the existing level, but we must also continue to improve. At present, some units are carrying out new creations while carrying out the struggle against corruption and theft, and have overfulfilled the production plan. Their experience should be promoted and popularized. Those who have relaxed production leadership due to the struggle against corruption and theft should be corrected immediately, and strive to thoroughly investigate corruption and theft elements on the one hand, and complete production tasks on the other.

### 以实际行动来反对美国侵略者的细菌战

    以实际行动来反对美国侵略者的细菌战
    万恶的美国侵略者违犯国际公约和人类道德，在朝鲜和我国东北、山东青岛地区进行细菌战争，激起了全中国人民和全世界人民的极度愤怒。继我国周恩来外长的严正声明和各民主党派的强烈抗议之后，各机关、团体、学校、工厂、农村以至宗教组织，都一致声讨美国侵略者，要求给细菌战犯们以最严厉的制裁。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会并已组织“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”，前往我国东北及朝鲜前线进行实地调查。这些行动，都表现出我国人民保卫世界和平、击败美帝国主义所进行的细菌战的决心。
    除了这些行动之外，我们还应该做什么呢？我国各民主党派对美帝国主义进行细菌战的抗议中，号召全国人民继续加强抗美援朝的正义行动，彻底完成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争任务，更进一步地厉行增产节约，以支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，给细菌战犯们以毁灭性的打击。这就是目前我们应该做的工作。我们除了在敌人撒布细菌的地区和附近地区加紧进行扑灭细菌的工作和防疫工作外，还应该从下列几方面进行切实的努力。
    第一、要继续加强对全国人民的时事政治教育和爱国主义教育，提高人民的爱国热情；不断地提高全国人民对美国帝国主义是中国人民死敌的认识和对美帝国主义的仇恨心。这是推进一切抗美援朝工作和建设工作的重要动力。放松了这一工作，就会使人民在政治上盲目与麻痹起来，丧失警觉。目前有一些地区报纸的发行量减少，有一些人不看报纸、不关心时事，正是政治上麻痹的表现。我们不能因为强调节约就连报纸也不看。发生这种现象的地方，应当赶快纠正。
    第二、集中力量，把反贪污、反盗窃的斗争进行到底，彻底肃清一切贪污、盗窃现象，堵住一切可供贪污、盗窃分子利用的漏洞，使我们能够在全国范围内有效地开展增产节约运动，保证人民增产节约的成果不被盗窃，而全部变成加强抗美援朝、支持人民志愿军的力量，变成国防建设与经济建设的力量，变成改善人民生活的力量。现在还有许多贪污、盗窃分子在用各种方法对反贪污、反盗窃斗争进行顽抗，企图混过关去，继续作恶；我们必须加强攻击的火力，采取各种必要的措施，把一切负隅顽抗的不法分子的碉堡彻底摧毁，迫使他们完全缴械。
    第三、把生产工作做好。目前已经开始的春耕工作和防旱、抗旱工作，应该抽调必要的干部力量加强领导，务必做好，争取爱国丰产。在工厂中，凡“三反”运动已经基本结束者，领导上应该用绝大部分力量来领导生产；凡正在“三反”运动中者，应该尽可能抽出必要的力量领导生产活动，保证完成一九五二年的增产节约计划。不仅要保持过去已有的水平，还要不断地提高。目前有的单位一面进行反贪污、反盗窃斗争，一面还有新的创造，超额完成了生产计划，他们的经验应该予以发扬推广。有因反贪污、反盗窃斗争而放松生产领导的，应该立即纠正，力争一面把贪污盗窃分子彻底清查出来，一面又能完成生产任务。
