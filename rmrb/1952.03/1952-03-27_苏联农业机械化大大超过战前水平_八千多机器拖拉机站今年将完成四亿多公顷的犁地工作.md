    Xinhua News Agency, March 26th: According to TASS, the scale of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union is expanding day by day.

    In recent years, the mechanization of Soviet agriculture has greatly exceeded pre-war levels. In 1951, machine tractor stations carried out more than 170 types of work, compared to only 90 in 1940. Last year, tractors completed 70% more work for collective farms than in 1940. Compared with pre-war levels, the total production capacity of tractor teams increased by 50% in 1951; the production capacity of crawler tractors doubled, and the production capacity of the most efficient and economical diesel tractors increased sevenfold. This year, more than 8,600 machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union will complete the plowing of more than 423 million hectares of land (1 hectare equals 15 mu), 38.5 million hectares more than last year. The level of mechanized sowing nationwide will increase to 82%, the level of combine harvesting of grain will increase to 72%, and the level of harvesting sunflowers will increase to 90%. This year, 57% of hemp threshing, 90% of sugar beet harvesting, 41% of grass cutting, and 58% of feed storage will also be mechanized.

    After the merger of small collective farms into large collective farms in the Soviet Union, the average area of each collective farm has greatly expanded, with the average arable land area increasing by 1.5 times compared to 1950. This has created favorable conditions for further improving the level of agricultural mechanization. For example, in the Kuban River basin, Ukraine, and the Volga River basin, all field work of many large collective farms this year, including plowing, harvesting, threshing, etc., will be completely mechanized. Currently, collective farmers and machine tractor station workers in Kuban have launched a socialist production competition to strive for the earliest possible completion of the mechanization of all agricultural work. Drivers of tractors, combines, and other agricultural machines have pledged to increase the production capacity of the machines. Tractor drivers have already exceeded the planned level of field work in this year's spring sowing.

    苏联农业机械化大大超过战前水平
    八千多机器拖拉机站今年将完成四亿多公顷的犁地工作
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联农业机械化的规模正在一天天扩大。
    近几年来苏联农业的机械化已大大地超过了战前的水平。一九五一年机器拖拉机站进行了一百七十多种工作，而在一九四○年只有九十种。拖拉机去年为集体农场完成的工作量比一九四○年增加了百分之七十。和战前水平相较，一九五一年拖拉机队的总生产能力提高了百分之五十；环带拖拉机的生产能力提高了一倍，最有效力而且最经济的柴油拖拉机的生产能力则提高到七倍。今年，苏联八千六百多个机器拖拉机站将要完成四亿二千三百多万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）土地的犁地工作，比去年多犁三千八百五十万公顷。全国播种机械化的水平将提高到百分之八十二，联合收割机收割谷物的水平将提高到百分之七十二，收割向日葵的水平将提高到百分之九十。今年打麻工作的百分之五十七，挖掘甜菜工作的百分之九十，割草工作的百分之四十一，饲料储藏工作的百分之五十八，也将实行机械化。
    苏联小型集体农场合并为大集体农场后，每个集体农场的平均面积已经大为扩大，平均可耕地面积比一九五○年增加了一点五倍。这就为农业机械化水平的进一步提高创造了有利的条件。例如，在库班河流域、乌克兰和伏尔加河流域，今年许多大集体农场的一切田间工作，包括犁田、收割、打谷等等，都将完全机械化。现在，库班的集体农民和机器拖拉机站的工人，已经展开了社会主义生产竞赛，争取尽快完成全部农业工作的机械化。拖拉机、联合机和其他农业机器的司机们，已保证要提高机器的生产能力。拖拉机司机今年所完成的春季播种工作，已经超过了预定的田间工作水平。
