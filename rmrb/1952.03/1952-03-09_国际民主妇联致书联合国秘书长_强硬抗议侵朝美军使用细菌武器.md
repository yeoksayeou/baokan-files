Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th. The International Democratic Women's Federation sent a strong protest to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the 4th regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors in Korea. The letter of protest was signed by Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation.

The protest letter stated: We, representing the International Democratic Women's Federation, composed of 135 million women from 62 countries, hope that you will pay serious attention to our strong, urgent and solemn protest against the United States of America's use of bacteriological weapons against the positions of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, as well as against peaceful residents in the rear. We express the indignation that all kind people must feel about this heinous act.

The protest letter pointed out: The United States, disregarding all concepts of humanity and violating all existing international conventions by using bacteriological weapons to wage war, is not doing this for the first time.

The protest letter said: Scientists have spent generations trying to eliminate diseases. Cholera, smallpox, and other terrible diseases have caused the deaths of millions of people. Eradicating these diseases is a victory for scientific progress. However, after a long period of preparation in cooperation with Japanese war criminals, the United States is now using the bacteriological weapons it has manufactured in an attempt to eliminate the Korean people and turn Korea into a wasteland.

The protest letter demanded that the United Nations immediately investigate the crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons and immediately stop them.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 8th. TASS reported from Sofia on the 8th: The Bulgarian National Committee for the Defense of Peace sent a telegram to the United Nations Secretariat, strongly protesting the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors in Korea. The telegram of protest stated: The Bulgarian National Committee for the Defense of Peace, representing millions of Bulgarian peace fighters, strongly protests the new and cruel methods adopted by the United States to destroy the Korean people, and insists that the United Nations immediately take decisive measures to stop the barbaric war in Korea and bring those who murdered Korean women and children to justice.

    【新华社柏林八日电】国际民主妇女联合会在四日就美国侵略者在朝鲜使用细菌武器一事，向联合国秘书长提出强硬抗议。抗议书由国际民主妇联总书记古久里夫人签字。
    抗议书说：我们代表由六十二国一亿三千五百万妇女组成的国际民主妇联，希望你严重注意我们就美利坚合众国对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军阵地以及对后方和平居民使用细菌武器而提出的强硬、迫切和严正的抗议。我们表示一切善良人们对这个恶毒行为一定要感到的愤慨。
    抗议书指出：美国不顾一切人道的概念，违反一切已有的国际公约而使用细菌武器进行战争，已不是第一次了。

    抗议书要求联合国立即调查美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行，并立即予以制止。
