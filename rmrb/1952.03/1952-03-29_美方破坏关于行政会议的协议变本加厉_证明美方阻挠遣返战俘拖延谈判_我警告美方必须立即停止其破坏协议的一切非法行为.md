Title: The U.S. Side's Sabotage of the Agreement on Administrative Meetings Escalates, Proving the U.S. Obstructs the Repatriation of Prisoners of War and Delays Negotiations, I Warn the U.S. Side Must Immediately Stop All Illegal Acts of Sabotage Against the Agreement

(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 28) After the U.S. side privately disclosed the details of the administrative meeting on the 25th to Reuters, it has intensified its sabotage of the agreement on not publishing the specific content of administrative meetings to the press, and blatantly continued to release the content of the ongoing administrative meetings through official news agencies. This continuous illegal act of the U.S. side in violating the bilateral agreement once again illustrates that the U.S. is deliberately obstructing the early and smooth resolution of the issue of repatriation of prisoners of war and delaying the rapid completion of the Korean armistice negotiations. This is completely contrary to the sincerity of our side in accepting the U.S. request to hold administrative meetings.

The official news agency of Ridgway's headquarters - the Tokyo Military Radio Station - quoted the statement of the U.S. news release officer Nakos, and publicly broadcast the specific content of the administrative meeting unscrupulously at 14:00 on the 27th, and carried out one-sided distortion propaganda, which seriously violated the agreement on administrative meetings.

While sabotaging the agreement on administrative meetings, the U.S. side unreasonably threatened our side to abide by the agreement. According to a Reuters dispatch from the United Nations on the 25th, "It is reported that the United Nations forces have warned the Communists that any disclosure of any concessions suggested by the United Nations forces will result in the agreement to hold secret meetings (referring to administrative meetings) being abandoned." It is well known that throughout the Korean armistice negotiations, the Korean and Chinese sides have always faithfully abided by all agreements, and it is the notorious U.S. side itself that has consistently violated the agreements; in terms of abiding by the agreement on administrative meetings, this is another good proof. Even the "United Nations" admitted this. Reuters said: "The United Nations received news today (the 25th) that the Communist reporters apparently did not obtain any information about the secret negotiations from the Chinese and North Korean representatives." The U.S. side's shameless intimidation of our side can only show that it has a guilty conscience and is plotting to repeat its habitual trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief.'"

Although the Nakos's statement quoted by the Tokyo Military Radio Station has exhausted the ability to fabricate rumors and slanders, this cannot cover up the truth. People can still perceive that the Korean and Chinese sides are continuing to work hard in the administrative meetings to quickly resolve the issue of repatriating prisoners of war, and are working hard to oppose the absurd proposition of "voluntary repatriation" in order to release and repatriate all the prisoners of both sides as soon as possible.

In contrast, the U.S. side stubbornly adheres to its absurd proposition of "voluntary repatriation," attempting to detain our prisoners of war. The Tokyo Military Radio Station frankly admitted that the U.S. "has always resolutely opposed" unconditional repatriation, "and there is no major change of attitude in the recent reports of the Allied forces." Even Nakos admitted that the U.S. position on the repatriation of prisoners of war is still the same old wine in new bottles. He said that the U.S. representatives recently canceled the term "voluntary repatriation" and replaced it with the words "no forced repatriation." However, Nakos unwittingly admitted: "In fact, the meanings of the two are the same, but it sounds better to the Communist side."

Whether viewed from the situation of the administrative meeting illegally disclosed by the U.S. side, or from the shouts of the personnel of Ridgway's headquarters outside the meeting tent, on the issue of repatriating prisoners of war, as before the administrative meeting, what is placed before people is still two completely different attitudes.

One is the one that the Korean and Chinese sides have always adopted, that is, they have always strived for a fair and reasonable solution to this issue as soon as possible, and, in accordance with international conventions, and also for the benefit of the prisoners of war and their families, to release and repatriate all the prisoners of both sides, so that they can return to their homes as soon as possible, reunite with their families, and restore a peaceful life.

The other is the one that the U.S. side has always adopted, that is, it has always obstructed the early and satisfactory resolution of this issue, unreasonably opposed our fair and reasonable proposals, stubbornly adhered to its absurd so-called "voluntary repatriation" proposition, proceeded entirely from the interests of the war, and completely disregarded the wishes and interests of the prisoners of war and their families. The U.S. attempt to use the absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation" to forcibly detain our prisoners of war and transfer them to the Kuomintang remnants and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang has long been clearly exposed. In order to create conditions for this absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation" in name but "forced detention" in reality, the U.S. aggressors have despicably and cruelly forced our prisoners of war to tattoo characters on their bodies and forced them to sign the "voluntary repatriation" petition with blood. The two Koje Island massacres created by the U.S. aggressors are bloody and concentrated manifestations of the "voluntary repatriation" conspiracy.

Even after the administrative meeting, according to the news revealed by Reuters Tokyo on the 25th, people can clearly see that the U.S. has not changed its conspiracy plan in the slightest. The so-called "new" proposal on the repatriation of prisoners of war put forward by the U.S. at the administrative meeting on the 25th is actually the same old stuff in a new bottle, and still has not abandoned the unreasonable request for "voluntary repatriation," and continues to attempt to detain our prisoners of war. According to the U.S. "new" proposal, even if our prisoners of war are "technically determined to be North Koreans or Chinese," as long as they are forcibly labeled by the U.S. as "anti-Communist prisoners," they cannot be repatriated. In addition, those of our prisoners of war who are from southern Korea can only be repatriated if they are "recognized as pro-Communist," otherwise they will be forcibly detained. This so-called "new" proposal of the U.S. is the actual so-called "concession" of the U.S. that Reuters was ordered to promote!

This tyrannical attitude of the U.S. against the repatriation of all prisoners of war not only shows its conspiracy to detain our prisoners of war, but also exposes the fact that the war-mongers in the White House not only do not care about the American soldiers who were driven to the Korean battlefield to serve as cannon fodder and were captured, but also have ulterior motives, and even do not hesitate to publicly massacre them. U.S. military aircraft have repeatedly bombed and strafed the U.S. and its vassal countries' prisoners of war held by our side, even though those bombed POW camps of our side have conspicuous marks. The U.S. war-mongers do not want all the American prisoners of war currently held by our side to be repatriated. They only hope that those prisoners of war who are willing to continue to be used as cannon fodder for them to drive back after being repatriated, U.S. representative Lee Bee officially said on January 21 at the subcommittee of the fourth agenda item: According to the principle of "voluntary repatriation," "only completely loyal personnel will be repatriated." He believes that in this way, the U.S. "will not encounter the problem of dealing with a group of dissatisfied elements or saboteurs." As for those American prisoners of war who oppose the war of aggression against Korea and may tell the truth about the U.S. war of aggression against Korea, the U.S. war-mongers obviously intend to refuse their release and repatriation. Once released, the U.S. authorities are not prepared to send these Americans home, but are plotting to imprison them in concentration camps. As early as January 21, the Washington correspondent of the Dentsu News Agency revealed that the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee had issued instructions to Attorney General McGrath on this matter. The instructions said: U.S. prisoners of war "may have different views from the official views on the purposes and objectives of the Korean War," and may spread news about North Korea and China. Therefore, after they are released, they must not be allowed to return home immediately, but must first be locked in concentration camps and isolated from the outside world. The instructions also said: All U.S. soldiers released by the Korean and Chinese sides must participate in a so-called "loyalty test" held under the supervision of representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. This test will be implemented according to the notorious fascist "McCarran Internal Security Act." The U.S. Department of Justice has prepared concentration camps for U.S. prisoners of war in accordance with this instruction. The locations that have been selected are: Florence, Arizona, Ali Reno, Oklahoma, and Chul Lake, California. The POW camps during World War II and the former aviation base in Wickenburg, Arizona. The U.S. authorities are also preparing to build such concentration camps in Japan. The brutality and inhumanity of the U.S. war-mongers are fully exposed in dealing with the issue of their own prisoners of war.

We once again solemnly warn the U.S. side that it must immediately and effectively stop all illegal acts of sabotaging the agreement on administrative meetings, abandon any disguised absurd proposition of "voluntary repatriation," and accept our humane, fair, and reasonable proposal to repatriate all prisoners of war in accordance with the wishes of the people of the world, especially the families of American prisoners of war, so that all prisoners of war can be released and returned to their homes as soon as possible to reunite with their relatives and friends and return to a peaceful life.

### 美方破坏关于行政会议的协议变本加厉  证明美方阻挠遣返战俘拖延谈判  我警告美方必须立即停止其破坏协议的一切非法行为

    美方破坏关于行政会议的协议变本加厉
    证明美方阻挠遣返战俘拖延谈判
    我警告美方必须立即停止其破坏协议的一切非法行为
    【新华社开城二十八日电】美方在私自向路透社透露二十五日行政会议的情况后，竟变本加厉地继续破坏关于不得向新闻界发表行政性的会议的具体内容的协议，明目张胆地由官方新闻机构继续露布正在举行的行政会议的内容。美方这种连续破坏双方协议的非法行为，再次说明美方存心阻挠遣返战俘问题的早日顺利解决，拖延朝鲜停战谈判的迅速完成。这完全与我方接受美方关于举行行政性的会议的要求的诚意，背道而驰。
    李奇微总部的官方新闻机构——东京军中电台，引用美方新闻发布官纳科斯的谈话，在二十七日十四时肆无忌惮地公开广播行政会议的具体内容，并进行片面的歪曲宣传，这就严重地破坏了关于行政性的会议的协议。
    与破坏关于行政性会议的协议同时，美方竟无理地恫吓我方必须遵守协议。据路透社联合国二十五日电透露，“传联合国军已警告共产党说，对联合国军建议的任何让步若有丝毫的泄露，结果都会使举行秘密会议（按指行政性的会议）的协定被废弃。”众所周知，在整个朝鲜停战谈判过程中，朝中方面是始终忠实遵守一切协议的，一贯破坏协议的正是声名狼籍的美方自己；在遵守行政性的会议的协议方面，对此又是一个很好的证明。即使是“联合国”也承认了这一点，路透社说：“联合国今天
    （二十五日）接到的消息说：共产党记者显然未从中国和北朝鲜代表方面获得任何有关秘密谈判的消息。”美方对我方的无耻恫吓，只能说明它自己作贼心虚，阴谋再度耍弄它所惯用的“贼喊捉贼”的下流手法。
    尽管东京军中电台所引的纳科斯的谈话，极尽造谣和诬蔑之能事，但是，这并不能一手遮天。人们还是可以觉察到：朝中方面在行政会议中继续在为迅速解决遣返俘虏问题而努力，为反对“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张以早日释放和遣返双方的全部被俘人员而努力。
    与此相反，美方则在顽固地坚持其“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，妄图扣留我方被俘人员。东京军中电台率直承认：美方“一直断然反对”无条件遣返，
    “而且在联军最近的报告中，一点也没有重大改变态度的表示”。甚至纳科斯也承认：美方对遣返战俘的主张迄今还是换汤不换药。他说：美方代表最近取消“自愿遣返”一词，而代之以“不得强迫遣返”这几个字。但是，纳科斯不打自招地说：“其实这两者的意义相同，但说起来让共方觉得好听一些。”
    不论是从美方非法透露的行政会议的情况来看，或者从李奇微总部人员在会议帐篷以外的叫嚣来看，在遣返战俘问题上，和举行行政会议以前一样，摆在人们面前的依然是两种截然不同的态度。
    一种是，朝中方面所一贯采取的，那就是始终竭力争取这一问题迅速获得公平合理的解决，根据国际公约，同时也为战俘及其家属的利益着想，释放并遣返双方所收容的全部被俘人员，使他们能够早日返归家园，与家属团聚，恢复和平生活。
    另一种是美方所一贯采取的，那就是始终阻挠这一问题的早日圆满解决，横蛮无理地反对我方的公平合理的建议，固执地坚持其荒谬的所谓“自愿遣返”的主张，一切从战争的利益出发，完全不顾战俘及其家属的意愿和利益。美方企图利用“自愿遣返”的荒谬原则，强迫扣留我方被俘人员，转送给国民党残匪和李承晚匪帮的阴谋，早已清楚地暴露出来了。美国侵略者为了替这一名为“自愿遣返”实为“强迫扣留”的荒谬原则创造条件，竟卑鄙且残酷地强迫在我方被俘人员的身上刺字，并强迫他们用血在“自愿遣返”的请求书上签字。美国侵略者两次制造的巨济岛惨案，就是“自愿遣返”的阴谋的血腥和集中的表现。
    举行行政会议以后，即使根据路透社东京二十五日电所透露的消息，人们也可以清楚地看出美方丝毫没有改变其阴谋计划。美方在二十五日行政会议上所提出的关于遣返战俘的所谓“新”建议，实际上是万变不离其宗，仍然没有放弃“自愿遣返”的无理要求，继续企图扣留我方被俘人员。根据美方的“新”建议，我方战俘即使“在技术上确定为北朝鲜人或中国人”，但是只要被美方硬指为“反共分子的俘虏”，就不能被遣返。除此以外，我方被俘人员中的籍贯是朝鲜南部者，只有“被公认为亲共分子”者，才能被遣返，其他都将被强迫扣留。美方这一所谓“新”建议，就是路透社奉命宣传的美方的所谓“让步”的实际！
    美方这种反对双方遣返全部被俘人员的暴虐态度，不仅说明它企图扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋，并且也暴露出白宫的战争贩子们对被他们驱使到朝鲜战场来充当炮灰而被俘的美国士兵，不但漠不关心，而且是存心不良的，甚至不惜公开地屠杀他们。美国军用飞机曾经多次轰炸和扫射我方所收容的美国及其仆从国家的被俘人员，尽管那些被炸的我方战俘营都有显明的标志。美国战争贩子并不希望现被我方收容的所有的美国被俘人员全部遣返回去。他们只希望那些被遣返之后愿意继续被当作炮灰供他们驱使的被俘人员回去，美方代表李比于一月二十一日在第四项议程的小组委员会上就曾正式说过：根据“自愿遣返”的原则，“只有完全忠心的人员才会遣回”。他认为这样一来，美方就“不会遇到对付一批不满分子或破坏分子的问题”。至于那些反对侵朝战争的和可能说出美国侵朝战争真相的美国被俘人员，美国战争贩子显然是意图拒绝他们被释放和遣返。一旦被释放了，美国当局也不准备把这些美国人遣送回家，而阴谋囚之于集中营里。早在一月二十一日，电通社驻华盛顿特派记者即已揭露，美国参议院国内安全小组委员会对于此事已向司法部长麦格拉斯发出指令。这个指令说：美军战俘“对于朝鲜战争的目的和宗旨的看法可能和官方的看法不同”，而且可能传播有关朝鲜北部和中国的消息。因此，他们在被释放之后，不能被允许马上回到家里，而是首先要关在集中营里，和外界隔绝起来。指令又说：被朝中方面释放的一切美国士兵，全都必须参加在美国司法部和参议院国内安全小组委员会的代表监督下所举行的所谓“忠诚试验”。此举行将根据臭名远扬的法西斯的“麦卡伦国内安全法”来实施。美国司法部已根据这
    一个指令在为美国战俘大事准备集中营，已经选好的地点是：美国亚利桑那州的福罗伦斯，俄克拉荷马州的艾利·雷诺，加利福尼亚州的丘尔湖等地的第二次世界大战期中的战俘营和亚利桑那州威肯堡的前航空基地。美国当局也准备在日本建立这种集中营。美国战争贩子的残暴不仁和缺乏人性，在对待他们本国被俘人员的问题上也充分暴露出来了。
    我们再度严正的警告美方，必须立即切实地停止破坏有关行政性的会议的协议的一切非法行为，放弃任何变相的“自愿遣返”的荒唐主张，接受我方符合全世界人民特别是美国被俘人员的家属的意愿的全部遣返被俘人员的人道、公正与合理的建议，以便使全部被俘人员能够早日获释返里，与其亲友团聚、重度和平的生活。
