Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 21st: The United Nations Disarmament Commission held a regular meeting on March 19th. After the meeting began, the chairman of the commission, Canadian representative Johnson, allowed U.S. representative Cohen to speak first and answer the questions raised by Soviet representative Malik to the U.S. representative at the commission meeting on March 14th. These questions were: Does the U.S. government agree to prohibit atomic weapons and reduce armaments and armed forces? Does the U.S. government agree to let the United Nations Disarmament Commission begin work and adopt decisions on prohibiting atomic weapons and substantially reducing armaments and armed forces? Does it agree to let the Disarmament Commission study and condemn the criminal actions of the U.S. armed forces in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China?

As everyone knows, Cohen originally wanted to answer the questions raised by the Soviet representative at the Disarmament Commission meeting on March 14th, and later wanted to answer them at a press conference on March 15th. However, he was fundamentally unable to give a definite answer to any of these questions from the Soviet representative.

At the meeting on the 19th, Cohen launched slanderous attacks on the Soviet Union's peace-loving policies, attempting to avoid directly answering the Soviet representative's questions by this method, and to divert the attention of the commission and world public opinion from the U.S. government's aggressive policy of opposing the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and opposing the reduction of armaments and armed forces.

Soviet representative Malik refuted the U.S. representative's slanderous attacks. Malik said: Although the U.S. representative had to answer the questions raised to him by the Soviet delegation for the third time, he still did not give these questions a definite answer. The more he answered these questions, the more ambiguous the answers became, especially in his speech today. He decided to cover up the substance of his answer by slandering the Soviet Union; this has become a habitual trick of the U.S. delegation. In order to cover up the U.S. government's unwillingness to disarm and prohibit atomic weapons, the U.S. representative to the United Nations has been making all kinds of slanders against the Soviet Union from the very beginning of the discussion of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Malik continued: Cohen is the same today as before. But from his answer today, everyone has clearly understood that the United States still does not want to disarm. From Cohen's answer today, it can be clearly seen that the United States does not want to prohibit atomic weapons, and it intends to replace solving these problems with a proposal to collect information on armaments. Therefore, our questions have been answered: the United States does not want to disarm or prohibit atomic weapons.

Subsequently, Malik issued a statement criticizing the "work plan" of the United Nations Disarmament Commission put forward by the United States. Malik further elaborated on the Soviet delegation's position—the Soviet delegation advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons and the reduction of armaments. Malik put forward a draft work plan for the Disarmament Commission and demanded that the Disarmament Commission study the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare, the issue of prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons, and the issue of holding violators of the ban on bacteriological warfare accountable for their actions.

    在联合国裁减军备委员会上
    马立克重申苏代表团立场
    严斥美国拒绝裁减军备禁止原子武器
    要求研究关于违反细菌战禁令等问题
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：联合国裁减军备委员会在三月十九日举行例会。开会后，委员会主席、加拿大代表江逊让美国代表柯亨首先发言，回答苏联代表马立克三月十四日在委员会会议上向美国代表提出的问题。这几个问题是：美国政府同意禁止原子武器并裁减军备和武装部队吗？美国政府同意让联合国裁减军备委员会开始工作、采取关于禁止原子武器并大量裁减军备和武装部队的决定吗？同意让裁减军备委员会研究并谴责美国武装部队在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪恶行动吗？
    大家知道，柯亨原来想在三月十四日的裁减军备委员会会议上答复苏联代表所提出的这些问题，后来又想在三月十五日的记者招待会上答复。可是，他对于苏联代表的这些问题中的任何一个，却根本不能给予确定的答复。
    在十九日的会议上，柯亨对苏联的爱好和平的政策进行了诬蔑性的攻击，妄想用这种方法避免直接答复苏联代表的问题，并转移委员会和世界舆论对美国政府反对禁止大批屠杀人类的武器以及反对裁减军备和武装部队的侵略政策的注意。
    苏联代表马立克驳斥了美国代表这种诽谤性的攻击。马立克说：美国代表虽然不得不对苏联代表团向他提出的问题作第三次的答复，可是他仍然没有给这些问题以确定的答复。他对这些问题回答得愈多，这种答复就愈模糊，特别是他在今天发言中的答复。他决定用诽谤苏联的办法来掩盖他的答复的实质；这已是美国代表团的惯技了。为了要掩盖美国政府不愿意裁减军备和禁止原子武器，美国驻联合国代表从一开始讨论裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题起，就对苏联发出各种各样的诽谤。
    马立克继续说：柯亨今天和以前一样。但是从他今天的答复中，一切人都已十分明白：美国迄今仍不想裁减军备。从今天柯亨的答复中，可以很清楚地看出美国并不想禁止原子武器，它打算用收集关于军备的情报的建议来代替解决这些问题。因此，我们的问题获得了答复：美国不想裁减军备和禁止原子武器。
    随后，马立克发表了一个声明，抨击美国提出来的联合国裁减军备委员会的“工作计划”。马立克又详细地说明了苏联代表团的立场——苏联代表团主张禁止原子武器并裁减军备。马立克提出了裁减军备委员会的工作计划草案，并要求裁减军备委员会研究关于违反细菌战禁令的问题、关于禁止使用细菌武器的问题和使细菌战禁令的违反者对其行为负责的问题。
