Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th: 160,000 people in Shenyang held a demonstration and march on the 13th to protest against the heinous crime of American aggressors conducting germ warfare in Korea and within Northeast China.

　　The march was held in ten locations. The main parade of 50,000 people gathered in the square in front of the Municipal People's Government. Gao Chongmin, Chairman of the Northeast General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, addressed the marching crowds. He angrily denounced the American aggressors for continuously conducting germ warfare on the Korean front and in the Northeast, destroying international law, massacring the Chinese and Korean people, and attempting to expand the aggressive war. Gao Chongmin said: The people of Northeast China absolutely cannot tolerate this inhuman atrocity of American imperialism. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement. To safeguard human peace and defend the security of the motherland, we must wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors who use germ weapons. He called on all the people of Northeast China to further recognize the beastly face of imperialism from this atrocity of the American aggressors, and to defeat the germ harm of American imperialism on the epidemic prevention front.

　　After the speech, the march from the central venue began, and the 110,000 demonstrators in the city's nine other locations also set off at the same time. The people of Shenyang, who had suffered from the germ warfare of American imperialism, were extremely angry at the utterly despicable atrocities of the American aggressors. They shouted: "Oppose the American imperialists' germ warfare that violates international law and human morality!" "Oppose the heinous crime of American aggressors spreading germs in Korea and Northeast China!" The marchers held up placards with slogans such as: "Resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and severely punish the germ warfare criminals!" "Intensify the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, and defeat the germ warfare of the American aggressors!" The marchers also carried huge cartoons exposing the crimes of the American murderers in conducting germ warfare. The cartoons read: "American germ warfare criminals cannot escape the just sanctions of the people of the world!"

　　Among those participating in the march were the famous industrial labor models Ma Hengchang, Wang Zhaoda, and Liu Jinggui, who are studying at the Northeast Workers and Peasants Rapid Course Middle School, and Su Changyou, an advanced producer who created the three-section continuous bricklaying method and is studying at the Northeast Workers Political University. They unanimously stated: We workers are using our sweat and blood to build our beloved motherland, and we must not allow American murderers to use germs to destroy our happy lives. They called on all the workers in Northeast China to step up production, practice thrift, support the Korean front, and give the American aggressors an even heavier blow. There were also people in the marching ranks who had suffered from the germ harm of Japanese bandits. Their anger was even more difficult to restrain. Sun Jihe, an elementary school teacher who grew up in Wudan County, Rehe Province, had his mother, wife, and three children taken away by the germs spread by the Japanese bandits. He said sadly: "I will always remember these old and new hatreds, and one day I will demand this blood debt from the American and Japanese germ warfare criminals!" Deng Changhai, a worker whose sister's family of four was killed by Japanese germ warfare criminals, said: "I personally witnessed the disasters that the germs spread by the Japanese bandits brought to the people. I am participating in the march today, not only to oppose the American devils spreading germs on the land of Korea and our country today, but also to oppose the American devils poisoning the people of the world with germs tomorrow."

　　The people participating in the march were all filled with confidence that as long as the people of the world unite to sanction the crimes of the American aggressors, the safety and justice of mankind can be guaranteed.

    抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战
    沈阳十六万人民示威游行
    示威群众坚决要求严厉惩办细菌战犯
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】沈阳市十六万人民在十三日举行反对美国侵略者进行细菌战的示威游行，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和东北境内撒布细菌的滔天罪行。
    此次游行分十处举行，五万人的主要游行队伍，在市人民政府前的广场上集会。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会东北总分会主席高崇民向游行群众讲话。他愤怒地指责美国侵略者连续在朝鲜前线和东北地区进行细菌战争，破坏国际公法，残杀中朝人民，企图扩大侵略战争的暴行。高崇民说：我们东北人民对于美帝国主义这一灭绝人性的暴行是万万不能容忍的，我们坚决拥护周恩来外交部长的严正声明，为了维护人类和平，保卫祖国安全，对于使用细菌武器的美国侵略者，必须进行坚决的斗争。他号召东北全体人民应从美国侵略者这一暴行中进一步认识帝国主义的禽兽面貌，并且要在防疫战线上战胜美帝国主义的细菌毒害。
    讲话毕，中心会场的游行队伍开始出动，全市九处的十一万示威群众也同时出发。身受美帝国主义的细菌祸害的沈阳市人民，对于美国侵略者卑鄙绝顶的暴行的愤怒达于极点，他们高呼着：“反对美帝国主义进行违背国际公法和人类道德的细菌战！”“反对美国侵略者在朝鲜和东北撒布细菌的滔天罪行！”游行者高举着标语牌，上面写着：“坚决拥护周恩来外交部长的声明，严厉惩办细菌战犯！”“加紧抗美援朝，打垮美国侵略者的细菌战！”游行者还抬着揭露美国凶手进行细菌战罪行的巨幅漫画，漫画上面写着：“美国细菌战犯逃不出世界人民的正义制裁！”
    参加游行的有正在东北工农速成中学学习的著名的工业劳动模范马恒昌、王兆达、刘景贵等人，还有正在东北工人政治大学学习的创造三段连续砌砖法的先进生产者苏长有，他们一致表示：我们工人正在用血汗建设着可爱的祖国，决不能容许美国凶手用细菌来破坏我们的幸福生活。他们号召全东北的工人加紧生产，厉行节约，支援朝鲜前线，给美国侵略者以更加沉重的打击。游行队伍中还有曾经身受日寇细菌毒害的人，他们的愤怒情绪更是难以抑制。一位小学教师孙继和生长在热河省乌丹县城，曾被日寇散布的细菌夺去了母亲、妻子和三个孩子的生命，他悲愤地说：“我要永远记住这些旧恨新仇，总有一天我要向美、日细菌战犯讨回这一笔血债！”一个被日本细菌战犯害死他姐姐一家四口的工人邓长海说：“我亲眼看到过日寇散布的细菌带给人民的灾难，我今天参加游行，不仅是为了反对美国鬼子今天在朝鲜和我国的土地上撒放细菌，也是为了反对美国鬼子明天用细菌去毒害全世界的人民。”
    参加游行的人们都满怀信心地认为：只要全世界人民一致起来制裁美国侵略者的罪行，人类的安全和正义是能够得到保障的。
