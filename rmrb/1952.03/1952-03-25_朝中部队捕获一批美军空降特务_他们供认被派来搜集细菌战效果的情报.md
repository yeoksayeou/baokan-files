    Korean and Chinese Forces Capture a Group of US Airborne Spies
    They Confess to Being Sent to Collect Intelligence on the Effects of Bacteriological Warfare
    [Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 24th] The Korean and Chinese People's Armies recently captured a group of spies airdropped by the American invading army into our rear. These spies were disguised as soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and carried weapons, radios, cameras, medicines, and other items. According to their confessions, they received more than a month of training in January of this year at an agency under the US Eighth Army Command in Seoul that specializes in training spies. The main task they were sent on this time was to collect intelligence on the effects of the bacteriological warfare being conducted by the American invaders and to scout out the epidemic prevention situation of our military and civilians.
    This fact thoroughly smashes the shameless denials of the US government Secretary of State Acheson and the so-called "United Nations Commander" Ridgway and their ilk regarding their crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare; and exposes their extremely ugly faces. They shout every day about sending some "International Committee of the Red Cross" to our rear to conduct "on-the-spot investigations," the purpose of which is exactly the same as their dispatching these spies.

    朝中部队捕获一批美军空降特务
    他们供认被派来搜集细菌战效果的情报
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】朝、中人民军队在最近捕获美国侵略军空降到我军后方的一批特务。这些特务化装成朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的战士，并带有枪支、电台、照像机、药品等物。据供称，他们今年一月份在汉城美国第八军司令部下属的一个专门训练特务的机构，受了一个多月的训练。这次派他们来的主要任务，是搜集美国侵略者进行细菌战的效果的情报，刺探我方军民防疫情况。
    这一事实彻底粉碎了美国政府国务卿艾奇逊和所谓“联合国军总司令”李奇微之流对其进行细菌战罪行的无耻抵赖；并暴露了他们极端丑恶的嘴脸。他们天天喊叫要派什么“红十字国际委员会”到我军后方来“实地调查”，其目的正和他们派遣这些特务一样。
