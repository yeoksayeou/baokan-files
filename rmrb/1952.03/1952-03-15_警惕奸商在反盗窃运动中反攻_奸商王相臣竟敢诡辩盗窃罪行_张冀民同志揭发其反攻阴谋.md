    Beware of Counterattacks by Unscrupulous Merchants in the Anti-Theft Campaign
    Unscrupulous Merchant Wang Xiangchen Dares to Quibble Over Theft Crimes
    Comrade Zhang Jimin Exposes His Counterattack Conspiracy
    Editor's Note: On February 24th, this newspaper published a message on page two, "Fu Guangqing Colludes with a Group of Unscrupulous Merchants to Sign False Contracts and Embezzle Large Amounts of Money." The unscrupulous merchant Wang Xiangchen, mentioned in this message, immediately called this newspaper, claiming that the article was "inconsistent with the facts and requesting a correction." He also wrote a letter stating that he himself was not an unscrupulous merchant. He even accused state-owned enterprises of being untrustworthy and not "paying 20% according to the contract." In order to expose the shameless lies of the unscrupulous merchant, this newspaper immediately sent a letter to the Anci County People's Court in Hebei Province for a detailed explanation. Zhang Jimin, the president of the court, completely confirmed in his reply that the letter from the unscrupulous merchant Wang Xiangchen was a shameless deception. We believe that malicious and vile unscrupulous merchants who dare to reverse black and white and launch counterattacks against the people should be given necessary punishment.

    Comrade Zhang Jimin's Letter
    Comrade Editor: Your letter has been received. The unscrupulous merchant Wang Xiangchen mentioned in the article "Fu Guangqing Colludes with a Group of Unscrupulous Merchants to Sign False Contracts and Embezzle Large Amounts of Money" published on page two of the People's Daily on February 24th, sent you a letter refusing to admit the fact that he stole and defrauded state property, and denying that he is an unscrupulous merchant. This is his rampant behavior of attacking us again. Now I will explain the situation to you.

    The contract between the Langfang Branch of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative Coal Industry Main Station and the unscrupulous merchant Wang Xiangchen stipulated "ordering 1.7 million bricks," "the standard is four-inch bricks (25 cm long, 12 cm wide)," and "the amount of smoke holes and water absorption cannot exceed 5% at most." The coal station did inspect and accept the bricks before the new year. However, during the inspection, the unscrupulous merchant's behavior of cutting corners was detected. Most of the bricks produced were not up to size, generally 5 millimeters short; the amount of smoke holes and water absorption reached more than 50%. Comrade Zhao Jiajun, the inspector, refused to accept them at the time. Because the unscrupulous merchant Wang Xiangchen had repeatedly bribed Fu Guangqing, the director of the Langfang Coal Station, he went to the coal station to find Fu Guangqing and asked him to call the inspector back. These bricks were indeed inspected by the Equipment Company, but the inspectors of the Equipment Company inspected more than one million bricks, and because the bricks did not meet the specifications, they did not complete the inspection. Based on this situation, can it be said that the unscrupulous merchant Wang Xiangchen handed over a single brick to the state? Even if we had accepted them all twice, does that mean they are not responsible for the illegal act of cutting corners?

    The unscrupulous merchant Wang Xiangchen denies that he is an unscrupulous merchant. He has no right to speak on this issue. We have found out (and he himself has admitted) that he and another unscrupulous merchant, Wang Guangchun, conspired to bribe Fu Guangqing with a rubber-wheeled cart and a mule (worth 7.3 million yuan). He also personally bribed Fu Guangqing with woolen blankets, pastries, etc. He also bribed a section chief of Daxing County with a fur coat. In the brick ordering contract, he showed the insidious and cunning nature of an unscrupulous merchant even more. If he is not considered an unscrupulous merchant, who is? In addition, he said in his letter to you: "...after mediation by the Anci County People's Court..." This is not true at all. We have never mediated anything for him. His letter is completely slander and defamation of the People's Government, and is deception to you.
    Zhang Jimin, President of the Anci County People's Court, Hebei Province

    Attached: Letter from Unscrupulous Merchant Wang Xiangchen
    Comrade Editor: Regarding the matter published in your newspaper on February 24th about Fu Guangqing signing a false contract with a group of unscrupulous merchants, the fact that Wang Xiangchen ordered 1.7 million bricks is very different from the truth. The facts are briefly stated as follows: According to the contract signed between the Wanzhuang Huaxing Brick Kiln and the Langfang Cooperative Coal Station, 1.7 million bricks were sold, and Comrade Zhao Jiajun of the Coal Station inspected and accepted 60% of them before the new year. Later, the coal station resold the bricks to the Equipment Company. Comrades Huang and Li of the Coal Station, together with Comrade Gai of the Equipment Company, inspected and accepted 1,252,000 bricks twice, which is estimated to be more than 70% of the bricks. According to the contract, 20% of the payment should be made, but after repeated requests, only 19 million yuan has been paid so far. Now, after mediation by the Anci County People's Court in Hebei Province, the coal station will pay the 20% payment in full, and both parties have agreed, but the payment has not yet been received. However, your newspaper published that not a single brick was delivered and that I am an unscrupulous merchant, which is inconsistent with the facts. I hope your newspaper will investigate and correct this.
                                                                                                   Huaxing Brick Kiln Wang Xiangchen

### 警惕奸商在反盗窃运动中反攻  奸商王相臣竟敢诡辩盗窃罪行  张冀民同志揭发其反攻阴谋

    警惕奸商在反盗窃运动中反攻
    奸商王相臣竟敢诡辩盗窃罪行
    张冀民同志揭发其反攻阴谋
    编者按：二月二十四日本报二版发表了“傅广庆勾结一伙奸商订假合同大量骗款”的消息。这个消息中提到的奸商王相臣，立即给本报来电话，声称该文与“事实不符，要求更正”。并写来一信，说他自己并非奸商。他甚至指责国营企业不守信用，没有“按照合同规定付款二成”。为了揭穿奸商的无耻谰言，本报即函请河北省安次县人民法院说明详细情况，该院院长张冀民在复信中，完全证实了奸商王相臣给本报的信乃是一种无耻的欺骗。我们认为，恶毒卑鄙的奸商竟敢颠倒黑白，对人民进行反攻，应予以必要的惩罚。
    张冀民同志的来信
    编辑同志：来信收到。二月二十四日人民日报二版登载的“傅广庆勾结一伙奸商订假合同大量骗款”一文中提及的奸商王相臣给你们去信，拒不承认盗骗国家财产的事实，并否认自己是奸商，这是他再次向我们进攻的猖狂行为。现在我向你们说明情况。
    河北省供销合作社煤业总栈廊坊分栈和奸商王相臣订的合同中规定“订砖一百七十万块”，“标准为四丁砖（长二十五公分，宽十二分）”，“窝烟和顶水最多不能超过百分之五”。年前煤栈确曾查验收砖。但在查验中察觉了奸商偷工减料的行为，所出的砖绝大部分不够尺寸，一般的短五公厘；窝烟顶水达百分之五十以上。验收人员赵家俊同志当时表示拒收。奸商王相臣因曾多次向廊坊煤栈主任傅广庆行贿，就跑到煤栈去找傅广庆，让他把验收人员叫了回去。这些砖也真是叫器材公司验收过，但器材公司的验收人员看了一百多万块砖，因砖不合规格，没有验妥。根据这种情况，能说奸商王相臣交给国家一块砖了吗？即便是我们两次都一一收下，难道说他们对偷工减料的违法行为就不负责任了吗？
    奸商王相臣否认自己是奸商。对这个问题，他没有说话的资格。我们已查出（他自己也已经承认）他和另一个奸商王广春合谋向傅广庆行贿胶皮轮车一辆，骡子一头（价七百三十万元）的事实。他个人还向傅广庆行贿线毯、点心等等。他并曾向大兴县某科长行贿皮袄一件。而在订砖合同中，他更表现了阴险奸诈的奸商本性。如果他不算奸商，谁算奸商？另外，他给你们的信中说：“……现经安次县人民法院调解……”，这根本不是事实，我们从没有给他调解什么。他的来信完全是对人民政府的诽谤和诬蔑，是对你们的欺骗。河北省安次县人民法院院长　张冀民
    附：奸商王相臣的来信
    编辑同志：查二月二十四日贵报刊登傅广庆与一伙奸商订立假合同一事，其中王相臣订砖一百七十万块与事实大有出入。谨将事实经过约述如下：按万庄华兴砖窑与廊坊合作煤栈订立合同，售砖一百七十万块，曾于年前会同煤栈赵家骏同志挑验已足六成。后煤栈将砖转售给器材公司。煤栈黄、李二同志偕同器材公司盖同志两次验收一百二十五万二千块砖，约计收砖已达七成有余。按合同规定应付款二成，但经多次追索，至今只付一千九百万元。现经河北省安次县人民法院调解，该煤栈将二成款付清，双方已经同意，但该款至今尚未领得。而贵报竟刊载一砖未交和奸商等情，与事实不符。请贵报查明更正是盼。　　　　　　　　　　华兴砖窑　王相臣
