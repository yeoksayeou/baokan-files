    Letter to the Editor Excerpts

    Cadres on a Salary System Should Not Receive Grain for Cultivation
    During the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Comrade Wang Yanan of the local products company in my county confessed that his family had received excessive grain for cultivation.

    Comrade Wang Yanan was originally on a supply system, but later switched to a salary system. At that time, he should have notified the district and village to stop the cultivation on his behalf, but he did not. When grain for cultivation was distributed at the end of 1951, his family still received 800 jin of millet for the whole year (an excess of 600 jin). I suggest that cadres in all localities who are on a salary system should immediately conduct a self-check. At the same time, all departments implementing the salary system should inform cadres to notify the relevant counties, districts, and villages to cancel cultivation on their behalf.

    Do Not Use Moldy Grain to Feed Livestock
    Last month, many sweet potatoes in Jiazhai Village, Huashan County, Shandong Province, rotted, tasted bitter, and were inedible. The masses felt it was a pity to throw them away, so they selected the better ones, cooked them, and fed them to the cattle. The cattle were happy to eat them at the time, but the next day they became poisoned and sick. Giving them detoxifying soup did not help, and they died after two or three days. Now four or five cattle have died in the whole village. I hope farmers in all localities will not casually feed moldy grain to livestock to avoid losing big for small.

    Opening a Pharmacy is Very Popular with Cooperative Members and the Masses
    In the past, the Yangjiazhai Village Cooperative in Yuanshi County, Hebei Province, did not have a pharmacy, and some cooperative members and the masses would seek out witches when they were sick.

    In 1946, the cooperative opened a pharmacy, and this situation changed. The cooperative's medicine is inexpensive, of good quality, and the scale is accurate. Therefore, when the masses are sick, they all come to the cooperative to buy medicine. After the rectification of the cooperative last September, non-members were once prohibited from trading, and the masses, in order to avoid exploitation by private merchants, have been clamoring to join the cooperative. We believe that medicine is something urgently needed by the masses, and cooperatives should serve the masses in this way.

    来信摘要
    实行薪金制的干部，不应该领代耕粮
    在反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我县土产公司王亚南同志反省出他的家庭曾经多领了代耕粮。
    王亚南同志原来是供给制待遇，后来改为薪金制。当时他本应通知区、村停止代耕，但他没有这样作。一九五一年年底发代耕粮时，他家中还领了全年的代耕粮八百斤小米（计多领六百斤）。我建议各地实行薪金制的干部都立刻检查一下。同时，所有实行薪金制的机关部门，应告诉干部转告有关县、区、村，取消代耕。

    不要用霉烂的粮食喂牲口
    上月间，山东华山县贾砦村有很多红薯烂了，味发苦不能吃。群众觉得丢了可惜，就挑选较好的，煮熟了喂牛。牛当时很欢喜吃，但到次日就中毒发病，灌解毒汤也不济事，两三天后就死了。现在全村已死了四、五头牛。希望各地农民不要随便把霉烂的粮食喂牲口，以免因小失大。    赵修
    河北元氏县杨家寨合作社
    开办药铺很受社员群众欢迎
    河北省元氏县杨家寨村合作社，过去没有成立药铺，有些社员群众病了，就找巫婆。
    一九四六年，合作社开办了药铺，这个情况就改变了。合作社的药，价钱低，质量好，秤又准。因此群众有了病，都到社里来买药。去年九月整社以后，曾经停止了非社员交易，群众为了免受私商剥削，都纷纷要求入社。我们觉得医药是群众急需的东西，合作社应该这样为群众服务。
