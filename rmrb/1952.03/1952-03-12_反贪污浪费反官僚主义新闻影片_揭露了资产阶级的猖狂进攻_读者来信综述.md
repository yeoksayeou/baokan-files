Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, Anti-Bureaucracy Newsreel
Exposing the Rampant Attack of the Bourgeoisie
——Summary of Readers' Letters

Since the screening of the first and second installments of the "Newsreel Special on the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement," the newspaper has received letters from readers such as Lang Xucai in Beijing, Qi Ruisheng from the China Salt Industry Company, and Yuan Jingtian, an electrician from the Railway Ministry's Construction Engineering Department. These letters warmly welcomed the films. In the first installment, they saw an overview of the people of the capital actively fighting in the anti-corruption movement. In the second installment, they saw the shameful end of major embezzlers Xue Kunshan and Song Degui, and the government's lenient treatment of Hang Xiaozu and Xia Maoru, who confessed thoroughly and reported others while still guilty. They said that these profoundly educated themselves and the audience, making everyone more clearly aware of the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the working class in thought. Qi Ruisheng's letter stated: "When the audience saw the crimes of unscrupulous merchants like Liu Yuanjing, who cut corners, underreported quantities, and substituted inferior materials for superior ones in a military project in a certain area, causing serious losses to the country, they were filled with hatred." He indignantly said: "Look, the foundation is sinking, the roof is leaking, the walls are cracking... How despicable and shameless the unscrupulous merchants are! This film is the most powerful indictment against the big profiteers!" After watching the film, an old lady said to Qi Ruisheng: "Now I know that the unscrupulous merchants are really hateful. The newly built houses are about to collapse. It is truly outrageous. If the government does not severely punish them, there will be no law and order." Some people, after watching these films, mobilized others to watch. Yuan Jingtian's letter stated: "Today, we screened the anti-corruption newsreel special, which is a great education for corrupt elements and can help them climb out of the pit of fire." He hoped that these films could be widely screened to promote the progress of the movement. Some, after watching the second installment, praised the people's government's policy of handling corrupt elements as correct, pointing out a bright path for corrupt elements—only thorough confession is a way out. Otherwise, the punishment will be aggravated.
Readers unanimously hope to continue using the image of film to reflect this great struggle.

    反贪污浪费反官僚主义新闻影片
    揭露了资产阶级的猖狂进攻
    ——读者来信综述
    自“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的新闻特辑”影片第一、二辑放映后，本报曾接到北京市读者郎需才、中国盐业公司祁瑞生、铁道部建筑工程处电灯工人袁景田等的来信，这些来信热烈欢迎这些影片。他们在第一辑里看到了首都人民在反贪污运动中积极斗争的概况，在第二辑里看到了大贪污犯薛昆山和宋德贵的可耻下场，看到政府对于坦白彻底并戴罪检举别人的杭效祖、夏茂如宽大处理的情况。他们说，这些都深刻地教育了自己和观众，使大家在思想上更加清楚地认识了资产阶级对工人阶级进攻的猖狂性。祁瑞生的来信中说：“当观众看到奸商刘元敬等在某地军事工程上偷工减料、以少报多、以坏顶好、使国家遭受到严重损失的罪恶时，莫不切齿痛恨。”他激愤地说：“看吧，房基下沉了，房顶漏水了，墙壁裂开了……奸商们是多么卑鄙无耻啊！这部影片是对大奸商最有力的控诉！”看完这个影片后，一个老大娘对祁瑞生说：“这次我才知道奸商真可恶，新盖的房子就要塌了，实在丧尽天良啦，政府不严惩，就无法无天了。”有的人看过这些影片后，就动员别人去看。袁景田的信中说：“今天我们这里放映了反贪污新闻特辑影片，这对贪污分子是一种很大的教育，可以帮助贪污分子从火坑里爬出来。”他希望能够普遍地放映这些影片，以推动运动的进展。有的看完第二辑后，赞颂人民政府处理贪污分子的政策是正确的，给贪污分子指出了一条光明大道——只有彻底坦白才是活路。否则，必将加重处分。
    读者们一致希望继续用电影的形象反映这一伟大的斗争。
