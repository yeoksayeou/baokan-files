    Guangzhou City Trust and Trade Company Responsible Cadres
    Xiao Fanbo and Others Reprimanded for Suppressing Mass Criticism
    Editor's Note: In December of last year, this newspaper received a letter from reader He Shan exposing the responsible cadres of the Guangzhou City Trust and Trade Company for threatening informants. This letter was forwarded to the Guangzhou Municipal People's Supervisory Committee for investigation and handling. On the 12th of this month, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Supervisory Committee sent a letter stating that they had handled the case. We now publish a summary of the reader's original letter and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Supervisory Committee's handling of the case.
    This incident shows that any bureaucrat who dares to suppress mass criticism will be subject to the legal sanctions of the People's Government. All agencies receiving mass letters of complaint must be responsible to the informants, responsibly handle the matters they report, and keep the informants' identities confidential. It is extremely wrong to disclose the identity of an informant or to give the original letter of complaint to the accused agency or individual.
    Original Letter from the Informant
    Editor: In November of last year, I wrote to the Guangzhou Municipal People's Supervisory Committee to report that Li Shaoxiang, the manager of Guangzhou Ning Tong Hang, a deceitful merchant, was suspected of colluding with personnel from the Guangzhou City Trust and Trade Company to steal state property. Because the Supervisory Committee sent my letter of complaint to the accused for a reply, my name and address were disclosed to the Trust and Trade Company, and I was therefore subjected to their threats and intimidation.
    The simple course of events is as follows: In September of last year, the Guangzhou City Trust and Trade Company, in order to establish a new Chinese medicine service department, found an office address at 47 Kangri East Road in the city and purchased more than 30 pieces of furniture, including fir wood bed boards, frames, and shelves, from Li Shaoxiang, the manager of Ning Tong Hang, a deceitful merchant. Li Shaoxiang dared to demand a huge price of 23 million yuan for these old fir wood furniture. The Trust and Trade Company did not examine the quantity and quality of the furniture purchased and rashly paid the full amount. These ordinary old furniture are available everywhere. Why didn't the Trust and Trade Company purchase them from furniture stores with marked prices, but instead traded privately with Li Shaoxiang at a price several times higher than the market price? This cannot help but make people suspect that there is fraudulent behavior between them.
    After the Trust and Trade Company discovered that I had reported this matter, instead of examining themselves, they sent people to find me and threatened me at my home, telling me to admit my "mistake" and immediately withdraw the "false accusation." Afterwards, they wrote a letter urging me to come to the company on time within the deadline to "discuss solutions," and threatened me with phrases such as "otherwise, we can only handle it according to law" and "you will bear full responsibility for all consequences."
    Based on the above facts, I hope you will support me so that the broad masses can break their concerns and dare to struggle against all corruption and waste. He Shan

    Guangzhou Municipal People's Supervisory Committee
    Handling of the Incident of Suppressing Complaints
    Editor: On November 5, 1951, this committee received a letter from citizen He Shan, reporting that the Guangzhou City Trust and Trade Company was suspected of colluding with Ning Tong Hang merchant Li Shaoxiang to defraud state property when purchasing furniture. This committee instructed the Personnel Office of the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce to investigate and handle the case and then report back. On November 30, the Personnel Office of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce forwarded a report from the City Trust and Trade Company on the handling of the case and a self-criticism, stating: "Because of insufficient understanding of the situation, we were deceived by Ning Tong Hang's transfer of shop property. Our company has filed a lawsuit with the court to recover the defrauded transfer fee and await the verdict, and on December 24, we convened relevant personnel to conduct a review." However, Xiao Fanbo, the deputy manager of the company, and Ma Zhigui did not conduct a thorough review of the matter. On the contrary, they investigated the motives of the informant. They first sent a letter to the informant inviting him to talk to the company. When the informant did not go, they sent people and wrote letters twice to threaten and intimidate him. A few days later, when the informant went to the company to meet Deputy Manager Xiao, Xiao read the original letter to the informant and scolded him for fabricating facts, forcing the informant to withdraw the original case.
    The judgment of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Court proves that Ning Tong Hang's deceitful merchant Li Shaoxiang privately transferred the shop address without the owner's consent and deceived the plaintiff, which is a serious fraudulent act in violation of government regulations. According to the re-evaluation by the Furniture Trade Union, the total value of all the property transferred to the plaintiff is at most 10 million yuan. The staff of the Trust and Trade Company did not conduct in-depth investigations, did not understand the situation, and trusted the deceitful merchant without principle, causing undue losses to state property, which is very wrong. The responsible persons of the company, after receiving the citizen He Shan's letter of complaint, repeatedly sent people and wrote letters to threaten and intimidate him, which is an even more serious mistake.
    On January 23 of this year, this committee convened relevant personnel from the City Trust and Trade Company to discuss the issue of responsibility for writing threatening letters and instructed Deputy Manager Xiao and Secretary Song Zhixing of the company to make a written self-criticism. However, their self-criticism was extremely superficial. Instead of seriously examining themselves, they deliberately blurred the essence of the problem, trying to explain the fact of writing threatening letters as merely "the wording was a little severe" and was to solve the "leasing problem," "although there were threatening words, there were no threatening thoughts."
    We believe that Xiao Fanbo, deputy manager of the City Trust and Trade Company, as a leading cadre, not only did not humbly examine the citizen's complaint, but instead knowingly violated the law and wrote letters to intimidate the informant. Afterwards, he shirked responsibility, avoided the important and dwelt on the trivial, and did not admit his mistake, which is a serious violation of discipline. This damaged the political prestige of the People's Government. Therefore, he should bear full responsibility for this case. In addition to making a public self-criticism in the newspaper, he should be given the punishment of being removed from the position of deputy manager of the Trust and Trade Company. Deputy Manager Ma Zhigui, although he did not directly participate in this matter, advocated retaliatory measures in this case, which fueled the mistakes of Xiao and others, and should bear significant responsibility. Moreover, he did not admit his mistake afterwards. In addition to making a public self-criticism, he should be given a demerit of one level. Secretary Song Zhixing of the company, as a participant in this case and the drafter of the threatening letter, should bear partial responsibility for this case. In addition to making a profound self-criticism, he should be given a demerit of one level. Zhang Xuan, director of the Personnel Office of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, was perfunctory in handling this case and handed over the original letter of complaint to the accused agency, revealing the informant's name, which led to the informant being threatened. He should bear full responsibility for disclosing the secret. In addition to making a public self-criticism, he should be given a minor demerit of one level.

### 广州市信托贸易公司负责干部  萧汎波等压制群众检举受到处分

    广州市信托贸易公司负责干部
    萧汎波等压制群众检举受到处分
    编者按：本报在去年十二月份收到读者何善揭发广州市信托贸易公司负责干部威胁检举人的来信，即将此信抄转广州市人民监察委员会调查处理。本月十二日广州市人民监察委员会来信说，他们对此案已作处理。现把读者原信和广州市人民监察委员会对此案的处理经过摘要发表。
    这一事件，说明了任何敢于压制群众批评的官僚主义分子都将受到人民政府的法律制裁。所有收到群众检举信的机关，必须对检举人负责，对于他们检举的事情，加以负责的处理，并为检举人保守秘密；凡泄露检举人，或把原检举信交给被检举的机关及本人的作法，都是极端错误的。
    原检举人的来信
    编辑同志：我在去年十一月间，曾写信给广州市人民政府监察委员会，检举广州市宁通行经理奸商李绍湘有串通广州市信托贸易公司人员盗窃国家财产的嫌疑。因为监察委员会把我的检举信发交被检举人答辩，我的姓名和地址被信托贸易公司知悉，我因此受到了他们的威胁和恐吓。
    事情的简单经过是这样的：广州市信托贸易公司在去年九月间，为了增设药材服务部，曾觅得该市抗日东路四十七号为办公地址，并向宁通行经理奸商李绍湘购买杉木床板、框围、货架等家具三十多件。对这些残旧杉木家具，李绍湘竟胆敢昂索两千三百万元的巨价。而信托贸易公司又不审查所买的家具数量、品质，贸然如数照付。像这些普通残旧家具，到处都可买到，信托贸易公司为什么不向明码标价的家具商店购买，反而以高出市价数倍的价钱和李绍湘私人交易？这不能不令人怀疑他们之间有舞弊的行为。
    信托贸易公司发觉此事被我检举后，不但不?自检讨，反而派人找我，并到我处进行威胁，叫我承认“错误”，还要我立即撤销“诬告书”，此后，又写信催我按照限期准时到公司“商谋解决办法”，并以“否则惟有依法办理”，“一切后果由你负全部责任”等语进行威胁和恐吓。
    根据以上事实，我希望你们支持，以便使广大群众打破顾虑，敢于向一切贪污浪费现象进行斗争。  何善
    广州市人民政府监察委员会
    对压制检举事件的处理
    编辑同志：本委于一九五一年十一月五日接到市民何善来信，检举广州市信托贸易公司向宁通行商人李绍湘购买家具时，有互相串通骗取国家财产嫌疑。本委将该案责成广州市工商局人事室调查处理，然后具报。十一月三十日市工商局人事室转来市信托贸易公司关于此案处理经过及检讨书一份，内称：“因为了解情况不够，以致被宁通行顶让铺产进行欺骗，本公司已向法院申诉，追回被欺骗的顶让费，听候判决，并于十二月二十四日召集有关人员进行检讨”。但该公司副经理萧汎波、马志贵，并没有对此事进行深刻检讨。不但如此，他们反而追查检举人的检举动机。他们首先函约检举人来公司谈话，因检举人没有去，便两次派人、写信进行威胁和恐吓。数日后，检举人去公司会见萧副经理时，萧就把原信读给检举人听，并责骂检举人伪造事实，强迫检举人撤销原案。
    广州市人民法院的判决证明：宁通行奸商李绍湘未经业主同意，私将铺址出顶，并瞒骗原告，这是严重地违犯政府法令的欺诈行为。据家具工会前往重估，顶给原告的全部财产总共最多只值一千万元。信托贸易公司经办人不深入调查，不了解情况，无原则地信任奸商，致使国家财产受到不应有的损失，是非常错误的。该公司的负责人在接到市民何善的检举信后，竟数次派人和写信进行威胁和恐吓，这一错误更为严重。
    今年一月二十三日，本委曾召集市信托贸易公司有关人员讨论写恐吓信的责任问题，并责成该公司萧副经理、宋志行秘书作出书面检讨。但他们的检讨极不深刻，他们不是认真检查自己，而是有意模糊问题的实质，想把写恐吓信的事实解释成不过是
    “词句上严厉些”，是为了解决“租赁问题”，“虽有恐吓词句，但无恐吓思想。”
    我们认为：市信托贸易公司副经理萧汎波身为领导干部，对市民的检举不但不虚心检查，反而知法犯法，写信恐吓检举人，事后又推卸责任，避重就轻，不承认错误，是一种严重地违犯纪律的行为，这使人民政府的政治威信受到损失，因此，对本案应负全部责任。除本人应在报章公开检讨外，并给以撤除信托贸易公司副经理职务之处分。副经理马志贵，虽然没有直接参与此事，但对本案主张采取报复手段，助长了萧等的错误，应负重大责任，而且他在事后又不承认错误；除本人应作公开检讨外，并应给以记大过一次的处分。该公司秘书宋志行，是本案参与者，也是恐吓信的执笔人，对本案应负部分责任，除本人作深刻检讨外，应记大过一次。市工商局人事室主任章璇，对本案敷衍应付，把检举信原文交被检举机关，泄露了检举人姓名，致使检举人受到威胁，应负泄露秘密全部责任，除作公开检讨外，应记小过一次。
