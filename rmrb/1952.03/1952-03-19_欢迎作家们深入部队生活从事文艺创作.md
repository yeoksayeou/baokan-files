    Welcome Writers to Go Deep into Military Life and Engage in Literary Creation
    Comrade Editor: I am an ordinary literary soldier in the army. I read with joy the news about the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles organizing writers to go deep into life and engage in creation, as published in the People's Daily on March 6th. I think it is excellent that writers can go deep into the army, factories, and countryside to participate in the fiery struggles of the masses and experience life. This is just as the "Brief Review of Cultural Life" in the People's Daily said: "This is a gratifying new phenomenon in literary and art circles and the first significant result of the rectification campaign in literary and art circles."
    Currently, the masses' demands on writers are constantly increasing. They eagerly hope that writers can produce a large number of works reflecting the great reality of struggle.
    Now, our writers have undergone rectification and study in literary and art circles, and their thinking has been significantly improved. They have clearly realized that the true source of creation is the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are now willing to go deep into the masses, temper and transform themselves in actual struggles, and engage in creation. This is very good and very necessary. This correct approach will surely be welcomed and supported by the broad masses of soldiers and people.

    欢迎作家们深入部队生活从事文艺创作
    编辑同志：我是部队里一个普通的文艺战士，我以欢欣鼓舞的心情，读完了人民日报三月六日所载有关中华全国文学艺术界联合会组织作家深入生活，进行创作的消息。我认为作家们能深入部队、工厂、农村，参加到群众的火热斗争中来体验生活，是再好没有的事了。这正如同日人民日报“文化生活简评”里所说：“这是文艺界的一种可喜的新气象，是文艺界进行整风以后第一个显著的成果”。
    在目前，群众对于作家们的要求，是不断提高着，他们迫切希望作家能够大量地生产反映伟大的现实斗争的作品。
    现在，我们的作家们经过了文艺界的整风学习，思想上有了显著的提高，明确地认识到真正创作的泉源，乃是广大的工农兵劳动人民群众。他们现在愿意深入群众，在实际斗争中锻炼自己，改造自己，进行创作，这是非常好的，也是非常必要的。这种正确的作法一定能够得到广大战士和广大人民的欢迎和拥护。　辽西军区后勤部　李有焕
