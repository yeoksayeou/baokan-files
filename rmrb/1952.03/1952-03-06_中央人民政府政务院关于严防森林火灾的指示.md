    Last spring, forest fires occurred successively in Northeast China and other regions, causing huge losses to the nation's forest resources. The main reasons for the fires are that the leading cadres in some areas have insufficient understanding of forest protection and fire prevention work, do not understand the serious situation of our country's scarce forest resources and insufficient timber supply, do not know the important role of forests in maintaining soil and water conservation and reducing natural disasters, and do not deeply understand the central government's policy of protecting mountains and forests. Therefore, they adopt a passive attitude towards forest protection and fire prevention work. Some cadres even mistakenly equate forest protection and fire prevention work with agricultural production, believing that forest protection and fire prevention work "hampers agricultural production," or, proceeding from a one-sided mass viewpoint, encourage the masses to burn mountains and reclaim wasteland at will in order to "take care of" mass production, resulting in serious forest fires. In order to correct these erroneous behaviors that ignore forest protection policies and laws, strengthen future forest protection and fire prevention work, and prevent forests from continuing to be damaged, the following instructions are hereby issued:

    I. During the seasons when mountain fires are likely to occur each year, people's governments at all levels in mountainous areas and near mountainous areas should list forest protection and fire prevention work as one of the central tasks, with the top leader taking responsibility and personally arranging, inspecting, and supervising the work. The work of forest protection and fire prevention should be closely integrated with agricultural production, so as to vigorously mobilize the masses, educate the masses, establish fire prevention organizations, and formulate fire prevention covenants, so that the glorious task of protecting national forest resources becomes one of the patriotic and production-increasing movements of the broad masses.

    II. For large areas of mountains and forests, a system of responsibility by district and section should be implemented according to administrative divisions. Whoever's area catches fire shall be held responsible, and appropriate punishment shall be given according to the severity of the loss. If a serious fire occurs within a province, the governor of the province shall be responsible. If a fire occurs in a county, district, or village, the county magistrate, district head, or village head shall be responsible. Joint prevention measures should be implemented in areas bordering two districts.

    III. While ensuring that mountains and forests are not damaged, appropriate consideration should be given to the sideline production of the masses. The masses who enter the mountains for sideline production and the people who regularly live in the mountains should be organized and given forest protection tasks, so that their production organizations and production tasks are fully integrated with forest protection organizations and forest protection tasks.

    IV. In mountainous areas and areas near mountains and forests, burning for cultivation and wasteland reclamation should be strictly prohibited. Efforts should be made to persuade the masses to use grass cutting instead of burning for cultivation and wasteland reclamation. Those who set fires to burn mountains or damage mountains and forests in other ways should be punished according to law.

    V. During the fire prevention period, train attendants and public security officers on trains passing through forest areas should strictly prevent locomotives from spraying fire and boilers from throwing fire. The "Fire Prevention Measures for Forest Areas along the Railways in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia" promulgated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on October 26, 1951, should be earnestly implemented.

    VI. A thorough investigation should be conducted on scattered households within large areas of state-owned forests. If necessary, they should be persuaded and assisted to relocate or live together. Unscrupulous elements hiding in the forests should be arrested and dealt with according to law, except for those who can be educated and reformed.

    VII. Government agencies, troops, industrial and mining enterprises, and farms in forest areas should not only be responsible for doing a good job in forest protection and fire prevention within their respective areas but should also assist the government in preventing mountain and forest fires in nearby areas.

    VIII. After a mountain or forest fire occurs, the local people's government should regard fire fighting as the most urgent task, and leading cadres should quickly and personally mobilize and lead the masses to enter the mountains to fight the fire. Nearby stationed troops should also actively participate in the fire fighting work.

    IX. All transportation agencies (including railways, highways, telecommunications, etc.) in fire-stricken areas should provide transportation and communication convenience for fire fighters.

    X. The people's supervisory organs of the major administrative regions and provinces should pay attention to inspecting the arrangement and implementation of forest protection and fire prevention work by local people's governments at all levels. Those who work actively and achieve results should be rewarded. Those who do not earnestly implement forest protection policies and laws and cause serious losses should be punished.

    After receiving these instructions, the people's governments of the major administrative regions and provinces should immediately arrange this year's spring forest protection and fire prevention work and report the arrangements to this Council.

    中央人民政府政务院关于严防森林火灾的指示
    去年春季，东北及其他各地先后发生多次山林火灾，使国家森林资源遭受巨大损失。发生火灾的原因，主要是由于某些地方的领导干部在思想上对护林防火工作认识不足，不了解我国森林资源贫乏和木材供应不足的严重情况，不知道森林对保持水土、减免天灾的重要作用，并对中央保护山林的政策体会不深，因而对护林防火工作采取消极态度。有些干部甚至错误地把护林防火工作与农业生产对立起来，认为护林防火工作是“妨害农业生产”的，或者从片面的群众观点出发，为“照顾”群众生产而鼓励群众随便烧山燎荒，致引起严重的山林火灾。为纠正这些忽视护林防火政策法令的错误行为，加强今后的护林防火工作，使森林不继续遭受破坏，特作如下指示：
    一、在每年容易发生山火的季节，山区及山区附近的各级人民政府应把护林防火工作列为中心工作之一，由首长负责，亲自布置、检查和督促。把护林防火工作与农业生产密切结合起来，以大力发动群众，教育群众，建立防火组织，订立防火公约，使保护国家森林资源的光荣任务成为广大群众的爱国增产运动的任务之一。
    二、对大面积的山林，应根据行政区划，实行分区分段负责制，在谁的地区起火，就由谁负责，并根据损失情况的轻重，给以应得的处分。如在一省之内发生严重火灾，应由省主席负责。在县、区、村内发生火灾，应由县、区、村长负责。在两区交界地带应实行联防办法。
    三、在保证不破坏山林的原则下，适当照顾群众的副业生产，把入山进行副业生产的群众和经常居住在山里的人民组织起来，给以护林任务，使他们的生产组织和生产任务完全与护林组织和护林任务结合起来。
    四、在山区及山林附近地区，应严禁烧垦烧荒，积极说服群众以割草代替烧垦烧荒，如有放火烧山或以其他方式进行破坏山林者，应依法惩处。
    五、在防火期间，通过林区的火车的乘务员和公安员，要严防机车喷火和锅炉抛火，要认真执行政务院财政经济委员会一九五一年十月二十六日所公布的“东北及内蒙铁路沿线林区防火办法”。
    六、对大面积国有森林内的零星住户，应加清查，必要时应说服并帮助他们迁居或集居。对匿居林内的不良分子，除可教育改造者外，应予逮捕法办。
    七、林区的机关、部队、工矿企业及农场等，除应负责做好所属范围内的护林防火工作外，应协助政府防止附近地区的山林火灾。
    八、山林火灾发生后，当地人民政府应把打火工作视为最紧急的任务，领导干部应迅速地亲自动员和领导群众入山打火。附近驻军亦应积极参加打火工作。
    九、发生火灾地区的一切交通运输机构（包括铁路、公路、电讯等），应给打火人员以交通运输和通讯的便利。
    十、各大行政区及省的人民监察机关，应注意检查各级地方人民政府对护林防火工作的布置及执行情况。对工作积极而有成绩者，予以奖励。对不认真执行护林防火政策法令，而造成严重损失者，予以处分。
    各大行政区及省人民政府，接到本指示后，立刻布置今年春季的护林防火工作，并将布置情况报告本院。
        总理  周恩来
        一九五二年三月四日
