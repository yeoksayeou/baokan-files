    Exposing the Crimes of Wang Fufa and Others in Embezzling Disaster Relief Funds
    We are exposing the crimes of Wang Fufa, head of the Finance Section of the Yutai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Huxi Special District of Pingyuan Province, along with Qin Lianzhu, the deputy director, and Long Xuerong, the accounting clerk of the Sales Section.

    In July 1950, the Huxi Special District Cooperative entrusted the Yutai County Cooperative to purchase one million square feet of homespun cloth to support disaster-stricken people in their production. Wang Fufa colluded with Qu Fulian, the chief accountant of the cooperative's audit section, and embezzled 80 million yuan from the funds for purchasing homespun cloth, giving it to Long Xuerong's brother to sell sheepskin in Xuzhou. At that time, the disaster situation in Yutai County was very serious. Therefore, the government specially allocated one million jin of grain to urgently aid the disaster victims. Wang Fufa and others used despicable means such as altering receipts, over-reporting expenses, raising unit prices, and using small items to substitute for large ones to steal large amounts of emergency relief grain. Among these, it has been found that Wang Fufa embezzled 200.9 million yuan, Qin Lianzhu embezzled 153.8 million yuan, and Long Xuerong embezzled 86.8 million yuan. In total, the loss of state assets amounted to more than 500 million yuan.

    We were extremely angry when we learned of the crimes of these embezzlers. In the past, we were disaster victims who had nothing to our name and were forced to flee famine every year. Chairman Mao gave us production loans, relief grain, relief cotton clothing, and so on, so that we no longer had to live as refugees. However, Wang Fufa and other embezzlers, for their despicable purposes, actually exploited us disaster victims and sucked our blood. How can this not make us angry? If the more than 500 million yuan stolen by the embezzlers were loaned to the disaster victims to buy reeds for weaving mats, how many people could be supported!

    We demand that the government severely punish Wang Fufa and other embezzlers and recover the stolen money from them.

    揭发王福法等贪污救灾款的罪行
    我们揭发平原省湖西专区鱼台县供销合作总社财务科长王福法、副主任秦连珠、推销科会计龙雪荣等贪污犯的罪行。
    一九五零年七月，湖西专区合作社为了支持灾民生产，委托鱼台县社代购土布一百万平方尺。王福法勾结该社会审科总会计屈福连，从代购土布的款项中挪用八千万元，交给龙雪荣的哥哥到徐州去贩卖羊皮。当时鱼台县的灾情很严重，因此，政府又特别拨下一百万斤粮食，急救灾民。王福法等用改单据、多报费用、提高单价和以小顶大等卑劣手段，大量盗窃急救粮。其中，已查知王福法贪污二亿零九百多万元，秦连珠贪污一亿五千三百多万元，龙雪荣贪污八千六百多万元。前后总计国家资财损失五亿多元。
    我们知道了这批贪污犯的罪行，非常气愤。过去，我们都是垅地皆无、年年逃荒要饭的灾民。毛主席给我们发了生产贷粮、救济粮、救济棉衣等等，我们才没有再过逃荒的日子。可是，王福法等贪污犯，为了他们可耻的目的，竟来剥削我们灾民，喝我们灾民的血。这怎叫我们不生气呢？如果把贪污犯们所盗窃的五亿多元，贷给灾民买苇子编席，可以养活多少人呀！
    我们要求政府严惩王福法等贪污犯，并向他们追回赃款。
