Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 3rd: The East China Administrative Region's first-level organs have victoriously concluded the third campaign to encircle and suppress major grafters and, beginning March 1st, have launched the fourth campaign.

The victories gained in the previous three campaigns were enormous: the number of major grafters who confessed and were denounced increased significantly; leading officials in various organs have accumulated experience, skillfully mastered methods for combating grafters, and flexibly applied new tactics; of particular importance, the patterns of resistance of certain stubborn and unrepentant major grafters have been identified, thus making it impossible for them to escape the fire net of the battle in the process of struggling with wits, reason, and force.

During this period, the main characteristic of the "tiger"-beating campaign in various organs was the capture of nests of major grafters, destroying a number of "tiger dens." Many cases involved a wide range of people, had complex clues, and were not easy to detect, but after bold suspicion, investigation of facts, meticulous study of materials, and analysis of the grafters' activity patterns, a breakthrough was made. Following this breakthrough, the pursuit was relentless, and no case remained unsolved. Some units, after capturing "tiger dens" distributed inside and outside, entered into a full-scale attack; some units where the struggle had started later have now broken through several major "tiger dens" and are rapidly moving towards the climax of the battle. Another characteristic of the struggle is the rectification of the combat ranks and the strengthening of political work. To catch all grafters, large and small, it is necessary not only to continuously overcome right-leaning thinking, rectify the ranks in battle, educate cadres, keep eyes open, repeatedly explain policies, tactics, the enemy situation, and countermeasures; but also to do a good job of political work against the enemy. The Trade Department of the East China Military and Administrative Committee, in each encirclement and suppression of "tiger dens," on the one hand, reorganized its own ranks, explained tasks, and at the same time explained discipline; on the other hand, repeatedly explained policies to grafters, pointed out the direction, and made full use of various propaganda tools for publicity, so that the grafters quickly became divided, and some major grafters who had been hiding very deeply also came to light.

After the start of the fourth campaign, the momentum of the anti-corruption struggle is even greater; but on the other hand, the difficulties have also clearly increased, because a group of more stubborn major grafters are hiding even deeper. For this reason, the East China Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee has specifically emphasized that it is necessary to continue to deepen investigative research work, in order to fully grasp reliable materials, and sweep away all corruption criminals in all organs.

### 华东区一级机关发动第四次战役  围剿隐藏的顽固的大贪污分子

    华东区一级机关发动第四次战役
    围剿隐藏的顽固的大贪污分子
    【新华社上海三日电】华东大行政区一级机关围剿大贪污分子的第三次战役已胜利结束，从三月一日起展开了第四次战役。
    前三个战役所获得的胜利是巨大的：坦白和检举出来的大贪污分子显著增加；各机关领导方面已积累了经验，熟练地掌握了对贪污分子的斗争方法，并且灵活运用了新的战术；特别重要的，是对某些顽固不化的大贪污犯摸出了他们顽抗的规律，因此，在斗智、斗理、斗力的过程中，使他们逃不脱战斗的火网。
    这一时期，各机关打“虎”战役的主要特点，是捉住了一窝一窝的大贪污分子，摧毁了一些“虎窝”。有不少案件牵连较广，头绪较杂，问题不易发觉，但是经过大胆怀疑，调查事实，缜密地研究材料，分析贪污分子的活动规律，打开缺口，步步紧追以后，就没有不破获的。有些单位捕获了分布在内外的“虎窝”以后，就进入全面出击；有些原来斗争开展得稍迟的单位，现在也已突破了几个重大的“虎窝”，迅速走向战斗的高潮。斗争的另一个特点是，整顿了战斗队伍和加强了政治工作。要捉尽一切大小贪污分子，不仅需要不断地克服右倾思想，在战斗中整顿队伍，教育干部，擦亮眼睛，反复地讲政策，讲战术，讲敌情，讲对策；而且必须做好对敌政治工作。华东军政委员会贸易部在各次围剿“虎窝”时，一方面整理自己的队伍，交代任务，同时交代纪律；另一方面，向贪污分子反复地说明政策，指明方向，并充分地利用各种宣传工具进行宣传，使贪污分子迅速分化，有些原来隐藏得很深的大贪污分子也因而露了头。
    第四次战役开始后，反贪污斗争的声势更为浩大；但另一方面，困难也显然增加，因为有一批更顽固的大贪污分子隐藏得更深。为此，华东增产节约委员会特强调指出：必须继续深入地加强调查研究工作，以便充分掌握可靠材料，在所有机关中，扫清一切贪污罪犯。
