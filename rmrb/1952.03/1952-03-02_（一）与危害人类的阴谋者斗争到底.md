    (I) Fight to the End Against Conspirators Who Endanger Humanity
    Regardless of the angry protests of the Chinese and Korean people and the serious warnings of all righteous people in the world, the American aggressors continue to engage in barbaric bacteriological warfare in Korea. In the nine days from February 17 to February 25, they dispatched aircraft eight more times to drop bacteriological bombs and large numbers of insect bacteria in areas such as Ichon, Hampori, Sukchon, Guhwari, Wonsan, and Siban-ri in Korea. The continuous and large-scale perpetration of this inhuman bacteriological warfare by the American aggressors further exposes their heinous determination to destroy humanity and international law.

    Facts tell us that the American aggressors are not only a group of heartless, vicious murderers, but also a most despicable and shameless demon accustomed to slander. The U.S. "United Nations Command" initially turned a deaf ear and remained silent to the angry protests of the Chinese and Korean people, and then engaged in shameless denial, insisting that they "have never used bacteriological weapons in the Korean War." But when they made this denial, did they stop their atrocities for fear of condemnation by world opinion? They did not do so. On the contrary, they denied it on the one hand, and openly continued to engage in this heinous crime of endangering humanity on the other. But the facts cannot be denied. We have collected all kinds of evidence of the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare, including a large number of insect bacteria spread by the American aggressors, leaflets attached with poisonous insects resembling lice, fragments of exploded American bacteriological bombs, and unexploded American bacteriological bombs, and have taken photos. The American aggressors can never deny their criminal responsibility for engaging in bacteriological warfare, and they can never escape the just and severe sanctions of the people of the world.

    In order to defeat the bacteriological warfare of the American aggressors, our medical and health science workers have quickly mobilized and formed the Anti-U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Volunteer Anti-epidemic Inspection Team, the first batch of which departed from Beijing by plane on February 29 to work in Korea. This anti-epidemic inspection team is composed of dozens of people, including bacteriology experts Professor Yang Shuya, Associate Professor Fang Liang, Professor Guo Chengzhou, Professor Xie Zhimu, parasitology expert Professor Wu Guang, entomology expert Professor Liu Zhiying, epidemiology expert Professor Yu Huanwen, and pathology expert Professor Yan Jiagui. In the future, more medical and health science workers will go to Korea to work. The work of this strong scientific anti-epidemic force in Korea will surely provide effective assistance and great encouragement to the heroic Chinese and Korean people's soldiers and the Korean people. Our great Chinese people, together with the Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world, will surely defeat the American aggressors who are engaged in bacteriological warfare, and give this group of demons who endanger humanity a severe punishment.

    （一）与危害人类的阴谋者斗争到底
    美国侵略者不顾中朝两国人民的愤怒抗议和全世界正义人类的严重警告，竟继续在朝鲜从事野蛮的细菌战。从二月十七日到二月二十五日的九天之内，又八次派遣飞机在朝鲜的伊川、汉浦里、肃川、九化里、元山、市边里等地区投掷细菌炸弹及大量昆虫细菌。美国侵略者这样连续不断地、大规模地进行灭绝人性的细菌战，进一步暴露了他们决心毁灭人道和国际公法的穷凶极恶的面目。
    事实告诉我们：美国侵略者不仅是一批毫无心肝的穷凶极恶的杀人犯，而且又是一种最卑鄙龌龊的惯于血口喷人的妖魔。美方“联合国军总司令部”，对于中朝人民的愤怒抗议，开初是装聋作哑，默不作声，接着便进行无耻的抵赖，硬说他们“从来没有在朝鲜战争中使用过细菌战武器”。但是当他们在作这种抵赖时，他们是否因为害怕世界舆论的责难而停止他们的暴行呢？他们并没有这样做。相反地，他们是一面否认，一面又公然继续从事这种危害人类的滔天罪行。但是事实是抵赖不了的。我方已经把美国侵略者从事细菌战的各种罪证，包括美国侵略者所撒布的大批昆虫细菌、附有类似虱子的毒虫的传单、已经爆炸的美国细菌弹的弹片、尚未爆炸的美国细菌弹收集起来，并已拍成照片。美国侵略者绝对抵赖不掉他们从事细菌战的犯罪责任，他们绝对逃避不了全世界人民的正义的严厉制裁。
    为了打败美国侵略者的细菌战，我国医药卫生科学工作者已经迅速动员起来，组成了抗美援朝志愿防疫检验队，其中第一批已于二月二十九日乘飞机自北京启程，前往朝鲜工作。这个防疫检验队，是由细菌学专家杨叔雅教授、方亮副教授、郭成周教授、谢知母教授，寄生虫学专家吴光教授，昆虫学专家柳支英教授，流行性病学专家俞焕文教授，病理学专家严家贵教授等数十人组成的。今后还将有更多的医药卫生科学工作者，陆续前往朝鲜工作。这一支强大的科学防疫部队的赴朝工作，必将给予英勇战斗中的中朝人民战士和朝鲜人民以有效援助和极大鼓舞。我们伟大的中国人民，和朝鲜人民及全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，必能战胜从事细菌战的美国侵略者，并给予这一群危害人类的恶魔以严厉的惩罚。
