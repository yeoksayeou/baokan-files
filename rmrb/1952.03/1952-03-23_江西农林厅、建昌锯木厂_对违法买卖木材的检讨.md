In response to People's Daily Readers' criticisms and suggestions:

    Editor's Note: In the "Readers' Letters" column of this newspaper on December 12th of last year, Comrade Qiu Yi's letter was published, criticizing the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the privately-owned-publicly-operated Nanchang Jianchang Sawmill for illegal timber trading. Now, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry and Jianchang Sawmill have conducted self-criticisms regarding this illegal behavior. (The original criticism stated that Jianchang Sawmill was a joint venture between the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Department of Commerce, and private merchants. According to a letter from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Commerce, Jianchang Sawmill is a joint venture between the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and private merchants, and is not related to the Department of Commerce.) We are now publishing excerpts of these letters below:

    I. Self-Criticism from the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry

    Jianchang Sawmill was originally the privately-owned Datong Sawmill. In June of last year, our department increased its investment and transformed it into a joint state-private enterprise. In August of that year, when timber prices in our province rose, our department, due to departmentalism and a purely profit-seeking mentality, allocated funds to Jianchang Sawmill to purchase timber. Jianchang Sawmill then purchased timber at high prices in Ji'an, disrupting the market.

    The illegal activities and non-compliance with government currency management regulations in Jianchang Sawmill's operations are inseparable from our department's bureaucratic work style and capitalist business ideology. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, responsible cadres in our department have recognized the seriousness of this error. Our department accepts this lesson and guarantees that similar incidents will never occur again.

    II. Self-Criticism from Jianchang Sawmill

    We accept the readers' criticism of our factory. Our factory once purchased a batch of timber at high prices in Ji'an, which disrupted the timber market at that time. In addition, our factory illegally sold a portion of the purchased logs externally and delayed participating in the state bank's currency management. These are all violations of economic discipline.

    Our factory made many mistakes during its operation, and these mistakes must be resolutely corrected in the current movement against corruption and theft.

### 江西农林厅、建昌锯木厂  对违法买卖木材的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    江西农林厅、建昌锯木厂
    对违法买卖木材的检讨
    编者按：本报去年十二月十二日“读者来信”栏曾发表丘邑同志的来信，批评江西省人民政府农林厅和私商合营南昌市建昌锯木厂，违法买卖木材的行为。现江西省人民政府农林厅和建昌锯木厂已对这一违法行为作了检讨。（原批评认为建昌锯木厂为江西省人民政府农林厅、商业厅与私商合营，现据江西省商业厅来信说，建昌锯木厂为农林厅与私商合营，与商业厅无关。）现在分别把这些信摘要发表在下面：
    一、江西省人民政府农林厅的检讨
    建昌锯木厂原为私营大同锯木厂，在去年六月由本厅增入资金后改为公私合营。在当年八月本省木材价格上涨时，本厅由于存在本位主义和单纯营利思想，曾拨款交由建昌锯木厂收购木材一批。建昌锯木厂就在吉安高价收购木材，扰乱市场。
    建昌锯木厂在经营中的违法行为和不遵守政府货币管理的规定，都是和本厅的官僚主义作风、资本主义经营思想分不开的。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，本厅负责干部已认识到这一错误的严重性。本厅接受这一教训，保证今后决不再有同类事件发生。    江西省人民政府农林厅
    二、建昌锯木厂的检讨
    我们接受读者对本厂的批评。本厂曾在吉安高价收购木材一批，对当时的木材市场起了扰乱作用。此外，本厂违法把收购的原木外销一部，拖延参加国家银行的货币管理。这都是违犯经济纪律的。
    本厂在经营期间，犯了许多错误，这些错误都要在目前的反贪污、反盗窃运动中坚决纠正。
