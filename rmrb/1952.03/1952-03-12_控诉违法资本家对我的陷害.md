Accusation Against Unlawful Capitalists for Framing Me
Li Wen, Student of Nanjing Huiwen Girls' High School

I am a student at Nanjing Huiwen Girls' High School. I accuse the unlawful capitalists of ruining my life's happiness and of deceiving me and using me to seduce cadres. I accuse the unlawful capitalists of the crime of framing me to every upright person and to every classmate!

My mother is a person thoroughly imbued with bourgeois ideology. She disliked my father for being a petty clerk, for being poor, and for not having fame or status, and she insisted on a divorce. She took me and married a man who owned a cloth factory, because people said he was a "very good money-maker." This is my stepfather, Zhou Xiaotian.

Zhou Xiaotian and my mother saw that selling opium was more profitable than running a cloth factory. In order to make money, they disregarded morality and engaged in the opium business.

While studying at school, I learned that opium is harmful. When I gradually learned that my family was doing this harmful thing, I felt ashamed of them, and I always felt I couldn't hold my head up in front of my classmates. But as long as they could make money, they were happy and didn't care that this was a crime of harming others to benefit themselves!

After liberation, they continued to engage in this conscienceless activity. In 1950, the Yinhongyuan police station discovered the illegal activities of my stepfather and mother. In order to continue their activities that harmed the people, my mother and stepfather deceived me and secretly used me as a tool to seduce cadres.

First, my mother colluded with the wife of Su Dongjin, the local household registrar, and tried every means to lure Pan Bingsheng, the director of the Yinhongyuan police station at the time (now transferred to the Real Estate Administration Bureau), to my home, asking him to recognize my mother as an "aunt." My mother wanted me to get close to Pan Bingsheng, and she would walk away whenever we started talking. I was only seventeen years old at the time, and I didn't know they were using me to seduce a cadre. I heard my mother praise him for being a good person and a "revolutionary cadre." Pan Bingsheng also said that he was a party member and talked to me about political theory. I felt he was very progressive, and with my mother's support for her selfish purposes, I developed feelings for him. At that time, I remember my mother seeing that Pan Bingsheng and I had a good relationship, and she asked him, "Director Pan, we need your help with our affairs!" He said, "It doesn't matter, you have completely confessed and repented, there is no problem." Now, when I think back to those days when I was being used, it was like a nightmare: my mother had never been so kind to me, Pan Bingsheng said he "loved" me very much, and I thought that my family, under the influence of Pan Bingsheng, had really "completely repented." I was grateful to Pan Bingsheng, trusted him, and discussed my beautiful ideals with him, hoping that he would help my family do legitimate business from now on, and hoping that he would help me make progress, so that I could strive to join the Youth League in the future. But soon after, my family suddenly forbade me from getting close to Pan Bingsheng. I was in pain and couldn't bear to break off my relationship with Pan Bingsheng. They beat me with wooden sticks at night. At this time, I discovered that my family was still doing the opium business, and I decided to leave this dishonorable family. I sought Pan Bingsheng's support and asked him, "What do you think about my family selling opium?" He hesitated and didn't answer. I began to suspect him. I questioned my mother, why did she let me get close to him in the first place.

At this time, I understood: my family, fearing being sanctioned by the people for selling opium, used my desire to make progress as a tool to seduce cadres, hiding it from me and setting a trap, colluding with the wife of household registrar Su Dongjin, to "play matchmaker" for Pan Bingsheng, the first step being to let Pan Bingsheng come and "understand each other" with me, with the aim of having Pan Bingsheng suppress the case. Once Pan Bingsheng and I developed feelings, their purpose had been achieved, so they wanted to "take me back." At this time, I remembered that my mother had also given money to Pan Bingsheng, and sent him sweaters, mooncakes, cotton shoes, slippers... Isn't this bribery? Pan Bingsheng was becoming a corrupt element under the attack of the bourgeoisie. Later, when he was transferred from the Yinhongyuan police station to the Real Estate Administration Bureau, he also embezzled radios and many other things. I knew I had been deceived! I remembered my family saying to me, "We work so hard, isn't it all to raise you to adulthood." My stepfather and mother usually said they "loved" me, so is using me as a tool to seduce cadres raising me? Is that loving and caring for me? I was heartbroken that in this shameless trap, I sincerely wanted Pan Bingsheng to help me make progress, hoping to join the Youth League with his help! I hate that my bourgeois family is so vicious, so despicable and hypocritical! The object of my affection was also such a degenerate and corrupt embezzler. In despair, I attempted suicide, but my family discovered it three times in a row. They were unwilling to lose an "effective" tool and wouldn't let me die.

For many days, I buried this matter deep in my heart. I was afraid of being used again, of being deceived again. I saw my classmates lively and happy, but I always felt that I was an insulted and injured person, and my mood was always heavy.

After the anti-embezzlement movement was launched, I was educated by the school teachers and the Youth League and received help from my classmates, which made me realize that this is precisely the essence of the bourgeoisie's pursuit of profit and self-interest at the expense of others. In order to make money, they can not only shamelessly use their own daughter as a tool to seduce cadres and corrupt the revolution, but they also secretly harm our "most beloved people." I saw through the despicable merchants who, in order to pursue profit, did not hesitate to abandon running a cloth factory to sell opium that poisoned the people. I could no longer endure it, and I could no longer allow the unlawful capitalists' despicable and shameless behavior of pursuing profit and self-interest at the expense of others to harm people. I am a child of the Mao Zedong era, and I resolutely reported my parents who sold drugs and poisoned the people, and reported Pan Bingsheng who had become a corrupt element under the attack of unlawful capitalists!

The Communist Party and Chairman Mao rescued me from my suffering. If the anti-embezzlement movement hadn't been launched, I really don't know how far I would have been framed by unlawful capitalists! When I think of the despicable crimes of unlawful capitalists who harm others to benefit themselves, I hate them! I am angry! I want to resolutely stand on the front line of the struggle against unlawful capitalists. In order to repay the beloved motherland and Chairman Mao for saving me, and so that I and all the brothers and sisters growing up in bourgeois families will never be harmed again, I want to report my unlawful parents, I want to accuse them of the humiliation they have given me, I accuse the unlawful capitalists of their crimes of pursuing profit, self-interest at the expense of others, and poisoning the people to all upright people, to the vast number of students, teachers, and sisters in the city!

    控诉违法资本家对我的陷害
    南京汇文女中学生  李雯
    我是南京汇文女中的学生，我控诉违法资本家断送我一生幸福，欺骗我、利用我勾引干部的罪行。我向每一个正直的人，向每一个同学控告违法资本家陷害我的罪行！
    我母亲是一个被资产阶级思想浸透了的人，她嫌我父亲是个小职员、嫌他穷、没有名誉、地位，闹着离了婚；带着我嫁给一个开布厂的人，因为人家说他是个“很会赚钱的人”，这就是我的继父周孝田。
    周孝田和我母亲看到卖鸦片比开布厂更赚钱，为了赚钱，他们不顾伤天害理，就去做鸦片生意。
    在学校里读书，我知道了鸦片是害人的东西，当我渐渐知道了家里正是做这种害人的事情的时候，我为他们感到耻辱，在同学面前总觉得抬不起头来，但家里他们只要有钱赚，他们就高兴、就不管这是损人利己的罪行！
    解放以后，他们依然干着这丧尽良心的勾当，一九五○年，饮虹园派出所发现了我继父和母亲的违法行为，我的母亲和继父为了继续进行危害人民的勾当，他们就欺骗我，暗地里利用我做勾引干部的工具。
    先由我母亲和附近的户籍员苏东晋的妻子勾结好，千方百计地引诱当时饮虹园派出所所长潘炳生
    （现已调职房地产管理局）到我家里来，要他认我母亲做“姨娘”，我母亲就要我和潘炳生接近，我们一讲话她就走开了。我当时才十七岁，不知道她们是利用我去勾引干部，我听母亲夸赞他为人好，是个“革命干部”，潘炳生也说自己是个党员，跟我谈政治理论，我觉得他很进步，加上妈妈为她自私的目的而加以支持，就对他发生了感情，那时，我记得母亲看我和潘炳生的感情很好，就问他：“潘所长，我们的事要你多多帮忙啊！”他说：“那不要紧，你们已经彻底坦白悔改了，没有什么问题。”现在想起我在那些被利用的日子里，真像作了一场恶梦：母亲对我的态度从来没有那么好过，潘炳生说他很“爱”我，我以为家庭经过潘炳生的影响，真的是“彻底悔改”了，我感激潘炳生，信任他，把美丽的理想和他商量，希望他帮助我家里从今后好好地做正当生意，希望他帮助我进步，我争取将来参加青年团。但，过了不久，家里忽然不准我和潘炳生接近了，我痛苦，不忍和潘炳生断绝感情。他们晚上就拿木棒打我。这时，我发现家里居然还在做鸦片生意，我决意离开这个不光荣的家，我找潘炳生支持我，问他：“你对我家里卖鸦片的看法怎样？”他吞吞吐吐地不回答。我开始对他怀疑起来，我追问母亲，当初为什么让我和他好起来。
    这时，我才弄明白：我家里为了怕因卖鸦片的事受到人民的制裁，利用我想进步的心情做为他们勾引干部的工具，瞒着我设好圈套，串通户籍员苏东晋的妻子，要替潘炳生“做媒”，第一步是让潘炳生来和我“互相了解”，目的是要潘炳生把这件案子压下来，等到我和潘炳生发生感情以后，他们的目的已达到了，因此就要把我“收回来”。这时，我想起母亲还送过钱给潘炳生，送羊毛衫、月饼、棉鞋、拖鞋……这不是行贿是什么？潘炳生正是在资产阶级进攻之下变成了一个贪污分子，他后来从饮虹园派出所调到房地产管理局时，也贪污了收音机等许多东西，我知道自己受了欺骗！我想起家里向我说过：“我们辛辛苦苦，还不是为了把你教养成人”。继父和母亲平时说“心疼”我这个女儿，难道利用我做他们勾引干部的工具就是教养？就是爱我疼我？我痛心我在这个无耻的圈套中，还真心真意想潘炳生帮助我进步，希望在他帮助下参加青年团！我恨我的资产阶级家庭是这样恶毒，这样卑鄙虚伪！我发生感情的对象又是这样一个堕落腐化的贪污分子，在绝望中我曾企图自杀，可是一连三次都被家中发现，他们不愿意失去一个“有效”的工具，不让我死。
    多少日子来，我把这件事埋藏在心底深处，我害怕再被利用、再受欺骗，我看到同学们活泼愉快，我总是感到自己是被侮辱与被损害的人，心情总是沉痛的。
    反盗窃运动展开以后，经过学校教师和青年团的教育并得到同学们的帮助，使我认清了这正是资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己的本质。他们为了钱，不但可以无耻地利用自己的女儿，做为勾引干部腐蚀革命的工具，他们还暗害我们“最可爱的人”。我看清了可耻的奸商，他们为了唯利是图，不惜放弃经营布厂去卖毒害人民的鸦片，我再也不能忍耐了，再也不能让违法资本家唯利是图、损人利己的卑鄙无耻行为来害人了。我是毛泽东时代的儿女，我坚决检举了贩卖毒品、毒害人民的父母，检举在违法资本家进攻下变成了贪污分子的潘炳生！
    共产党、毛主席把我从痛苦中挽救出来，要不是展开反盗窃运动，我真不知道自己会被违法资本家陷害到什么程度！当我想到违法资本家那些损人利己的卑鄙罪行时，我痛恨！我愤怒！我要坚决站到向违法资本家作斗争的最前线去，为了报答可爱的祖国和毛主席对我的挽救，为了我和所有生长在资产阶级家庭中的兄弟姐妹们永不再受陷害，我要检举我的违法父母，我要控诉他们给予我的屈辱，我向一切正直的人们，向全市广大同学们，教师们，姐妹们，控告违法资本家唯利是图、损人利己，毒害人民的罪恶！
