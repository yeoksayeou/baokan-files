How to Defend Against the U.S. Aggressors' Germ Warfare

I. Question: What is germ warfare?

Answer: Bacteria are very small organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye. They need to be magnified hundreds or thousands of times under a microscope to be visible. Some, called "viruses," cannot even be seen with a microscope. A drop of water can contain tens of thousands of bacteria, and a fly's leg can carry tens of thousands as well. Many kinds of bacteria are harmless to humans, but others are poisonous. These disease-causing bacteria are called "germs." We get sick because of these "germs" and "viruses." The People's Government tells everyone to practice hygiene and get vaccinations to prevent poisonous bacteria from making us sick. Our hygiene scientists are constantly researching how to kill these poisonous bacteria and prevent them from harming our bodies. However, the wicked U.S. imperialism uses bacteria as weapons to kill people. They research, experiment, and manufacture large quantities of poisonous bacteria, spreading them in various ways to infect people with various terrible diseases such as plague, cholera, and typhoid. This inhumane behavior is germ warfare. From this, we can clearly see that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of all humanity.

II. Question: Why should the use of bacteriological weapons be prohibited?

Answer: Bacteria are invisible and cannot attack fixed military targets; they can only be scattered indiscriminately. Therefore, germ warfare is essentially the artificial creation of infectious disease epidemics among peaceful residents. We know that infectious diseases are the great enemy of all mankind. For example, over five hundred years ago (from 1361 to 1382), a great plague struck Europe, killing a quarter of the continent's population. Countries have spent untold efforts to eradicate infectious diseases. Only in recent years, with advancements in medicine, have many terrible infectious diseases such as plague and cholera been almost completely eradicated by human effort. However, if imperialism is allowed to use bacteriological weapons in war, it would be artificially recreating infectious diseases that humanity has strived to eradicate for centuries, which is against the will of all humanity and threatens the safety of all mankind. Therefore, countries have long advocated prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons in war. On June 17, 1925, representatives from forty-four governments signed a protocol in Geneva prohibiting the use of poisonous gases or similar substances and bacteriological warfare. In November 1950, representatives from eighty countries at the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw passed a resolution and addressed the United Nations, demanding the unconditional prohibition of all atomic weapons, bacteriological and chemical weapons, poison gas, radioactive weapons, and other instruments of mass destruction; and declaring that the government that first uses these weapons is a war criminal.

Because all humanity opposes germ warfare, even a villain like Adolf Hitler, though researching and manufacturing bacteriological weapons during World War II, did not dare to use them on a large scale. Japanese imperialism manufactured bacteriological weapons in large quantities and spread germs in Ningbo, Changde, and other places in our country during the Anti-Japanese War. Some of the Japanese germ warfare criminals were captured by the Soviet Union. Representing the justice of all humanity, the Soviet government organized a military tribunal in December 1949 to try a group of Japanese germ warfare criminals. This fact demonstrates that war criminals who dare to violate human justice and international conventions will ultimately not escape the sanctions of justice.

III. Question: How is U.S. imperialism preparing to wage germ warfare?

Answer: Since the end of World War II, U.S. imperialism has intensified its plans to invade the whole world. It has gathered the bacteriological warfare criminals of Hitler's Germany and fascist Japan, and is conducting large-scale research and manufacturing of bacteriological weapons at home and abroad. For example, the Soviet and Chinese governments demanded the trial of Ishii Shiro, Wakamatsu Jiro, Kitano Masazo, and other leaders of the heinous Japanese germ warfare criminals; however, the U.S. aggressors re-employed these people, ordering them to establish a "Central Headquarters" for Japanese germ warfare research in Tokyo and sending them to Korea to help conduct germ warfare.

Aggressors must research and experiment when manufacturing bacteriological weapons. They must find bacteria with the greatest virulence, test whether they can poison humans, and determine how they can be transmitted to humans. The inhumane U.S. aggressors are even using captured personnel from the Chinese and Korean People's Armies for experiments. According to information revealed by U.S. news agencies themselves, eight out of ten captured personnel of the Korean People's Army on Geoje Island in Korea have been sickened by these crimes of the U.S. aggressors, and many are severely ill. This behavior of the U.S. aggressors in maltreating prisoners of war has aroused the public outrage of people all over the world.

IV. Question: Can the U.S. aggressors use germ warfare to salvage their military defeat in Korea?

Answer: No, they cannot. First, because it is people, not weapons, that determine the victory or defeat of a war. Many historical facts have proven this point. Take the Korean battlefield, for example. The U.S. has more airplanes and tanks than we do, but they are still losing more and more. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army can defeat U.S. airplanes and tanks, and they will certainly be able to defeat their bacteriological weapons. Second, bacteriological weapons, like any other weapon, can be defended against. Bacteria must attach to other things or use insects and animals to spread. And these things can be eliminated. Infectious diseases caused by bacteria can also be resisted, prevented, and treated. Our bodies have many systems that resist bacterial attacks. For example, our skin can block many bacteria from invading the body; the nose hairs, mucus, and mucous membranes in the nostrils can trap bacteria; saliva and gastric acid can kill many bacteria; and our blood contains antitoxins and many white blood cells, which are specialized warriors for killing bacteria. Usually, there are many poisonous bacteria in the air, but not all of them can make us sick. Moreover, we can administer vaccinations to increase the body's resistance to the various bacteria that the enemy may use. Finally, after bacteria are transmitted to humans, it takes a certain amount of time (this time is called the incubation period, ranging from several hours to several weeks) before symptoms develop, at which time treatment measures can be taken. In short, as long as all our people take action together, the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare can be completely crushed by us.

V. Question: How should the people of the whole country oppose the U.S. aggressors' germ warfare?

Answer: First of all, the people of the whole country should not be careless about the U.S. aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons. In particular, the troops at the front and the soldiers and civilians in areas that have been or may be attacked by the U.S. aggressor troops' bacteriological weapons must be vigilant. Do not think that "a few flies dropped by the enemy are nothing!" If you are not prepared, it will cause losses. Secondly, everyone should not panic, because, as we said above, we are confident of defeating bacteria. In order to smash the U.S. aggressors' conspiracy to wage germ warfare, everyone should strive to do three things: First, publicize to the people of the whole country and the people of the world, thoroughly expose the brutality and shamelessness of U.S. imperialism, and unite the people of the whole country and the people of the world to jointly oppose U.S. imperialism, which is waging germ warfare. Now, because the people of China and Korea and the people of the world have roared in anger at the U.S. aggressors' crimes of waging germ warfare, the U.S. aggressors are already trembling with fear. While continuing to use bacteriological weapons, they are also lying and quibbling, insisting that they have not spread bacteria. However, the evidence is irrefutable, and the U.S. aggressors cannot deny it no matter how they quibble; they will not be able to escape sanctions. We must further expose the despicable and shameless true face of the U.S. aggressors and strike them even harder. Second, people in all work positions must intensify their work and strengthen the power to resist the United States and aid Korea. The Volunteers must fight more bravely and eliminate more enemies. The People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces guarding the motherland must be vigilant at all times against the intrusion of enemy aircraft and special agents. Resolutely implement Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of March 8, capture those enemies who dare to come to our country to indiscriminately bomb and spread bacteria, and treat them as war criminals. The people in the country must step up the struggle against "three evils" and "five evils," do a good job in spring plowing and drought prevention, launch a patriotic production increase and economy movement, and vigorously support the Volunteers. Only when U.S. imperialism is forced to accept a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue can everyone's safety be guaranteed.

Third, strengthen publicity, education, and organizational preparations for defense against germ warfare. In particular, health and medical workers across the country, and the soldiers and civilians in areas where the enemy has spread bacteria or may spread bacteria, should pay more attention to this. The method of defending against germ warfare is, first of all, that everyone must organize themselves, establish epidemic prevention institutions and groups at all levels, listen to the guidance of health personnel, learn some epidemic prevention knowledge, and make some epidemic prevention preparations. When enemy aircraft drop insects, rats, or other things, immediately report to the higher authorities and take emergency epidemic prevention measures. If the enemy drops flies, rats, etc., we can wear gloves, masks, or wrap our heads and faces with cloth, and tighten sleeves and trouser legs to kill them and bury them deeply in the soil; if it is shredded cloth, cotton, paper scraps, etc., quickly sweep them up and burn them; if it is fleas, bedbugs, etc., we can use insecticides to kill them. After work, the clothes we wear must also be disinfected before returning home. If there is no disinfection equipment, you can put them in a pot and boil them vigorously a few times. When necessary, the areas where the enemy has spread bacteria should be isolated. Soldiers and civilians in coastal and border defense areas must also be vigilant against the enemy using lighter-than-air balloons, submarines, or dispatching special agents to sneak into the country to release bacteria. In addition, everyone should pay attention to personal and public hygiene, and especially protect the cleanliness of water sources. Drinking water must be boiled. Food should not be crawled on by flies. And catch and kill rats, lice, fleas, flies and other pests as soon as possible. At the same time, everyone should get vaccinated and inoculated. See a doctor as soon as possible when you are sick. If doctors discover infectious diseases or undiagnosable diseases, they should report them to the health authorities as soon as possible. As long as everyone pays attention to these tasks, the bacteria spread by the enemy can be eradicated.

### 怎样防御美国侵略者的细菌战

专栏：宣传员讲话

    怎样防御美国侵略者的细菌战
    一、问：细菌战是怎么回事？
    答：细菌是一种很小的生物，人眼睛是看不见的，要用显微镜放大几百倍或千倍以上才能看见。有还用显微镜也看不见的，叫做“病毒”。一滴水里可以藏多少万个细菌，一只苍蝇脚杆上也可以粘上多少万个。有许多种细菌，对我们人类没有害处；但另一些细菌是有毒的。这种足以使人致病的细菌就叫“病菌”。我们人生病，都是由于“病菌”和“病毒”在作怪。人民政府要大家讲卫生、打防疫针，为的是不让有毒的细菌来使我们生病。我们的卫生科学工作者，经常在研究怎样杀死那些有毒的细菌，不让他钻到人的身体里去为害。可是，万恶的美帝国主义，却用细菌来做杀人的武器。他们研究、试验，制造出大批有毒的细菌，用各种方法撒播开来，让这些细菌传到人身上去，使人生各种各样的恶病，如鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒等。这种惨无人道的行为，就是细菌战。从这样的事情上，就可以看清楚美帝国主义是全人类的死敌。
    二、问：为什么要禁止使用细菌武器？
    答：细菌是看不见的东西，它不能攻击一个固定的军事目标，它只能漫天撒。所以细菌战其实就是在和平居民中间用人工方法制造传染病的流行。我们知道，传染病是全人类的大敌。比如，在五百多年以前（一三六一年到一三八二年），欧洲各国发生过一次大鼠疫，全欧洲的人口死了四分之一。各国人民为了扑灭传染病，不知花费了多少力量。直到最近这些年，因为医学的进步，许多可怕的传染病，例如鼠疫、霍乱，已经快被人力全部消灭了。可是，如果让帝国主义在战争中使用细菌武器，那末，就是把人类千百年来努力扑灭的传染病用人工方法制造出来，这是违反全人类意志的行为，也威胁全人类的安全。所以，很早以来各国就创议禁止在战争中间使用细菌武器。一九二五年六月十七日，四十四个国家政府的代表在日内瓦签订了一项议定书，禁止用毒气或类似毒品及细菌作战。一九五○年十一月，八十个国家人民的代表在华沙举行的第二届世界保卫和平大会，通过了决议，并致书联合国，要求无条件禁止各种原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器以及其他大规模毁灭人类的工具；并宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    因为全人类都反对细菌战，所以连德国希特勒那样坏的家伙，在第二次世界大战中间虽然研究、制造了细菌武器，但也没敢大规模地拿出来使用。日本帝国主义曾经大量制造细菌武器，抗日战争时期在我国的宁波、常德等地撒布过病菌。日本的细菌战犯们，有一部分被苏联捉住了。苏联政府代表全人类的正义，在一九四九年十二月组织军事法庭，审判了一批日本细菌战犯。这件事实说明，敢于违反人类正义和国际公约的战争罪犯们，终久是逃不脱正义的制裁的。
    三、问：美帝国主义是怎样准备进行细菌战的？
    答：美帝国主义自从第二次世界大战结束以后，就加紧进行它的侵略全世界的计划。它把希特勒德国和日本法西斯的细菌战犯们收罗起来，在国内、国外大规模地研究制造细菌武器。比如，对罪恶滔天的日本细菌战犯首脑石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等人，苏联政府和中国政府都要求予以审判；可是美国侵略者却重用这些人，叫他们在东京成立了日本细菌战研究的“中央总部”，并派他们到朝鲜来帮助进行细菌战。
    侵略者制造细菌武器要经过研究和试验，要找出一些毒力最大的细菌，试验它们能不能毒害人，并用什么方法可以传到人身上去。惨无人道的美国侵略者，竟拿中朝人民部队被俘人员来作实验。据美国的通讯社自己透露出来的消息说，在朝鲜巨济岛的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，十个里面有八个被美国侵略者这种罪行弄病了，有许多人病得很厉害。美国侵略者这种虐害战俘的行为，已激起全世界人民的公愤。
    四、问：美国侵略者进行细菌战能不能挽救它在朝鲜的军事失败？
    答：不能够。第一，因为决定战争胜败的是人而不是武器。历史上的许多事实都证明了这一点。就拿朝鲜战场上来说，美国的飞机、坦克是比我们多的，可是他们还是越打越输。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军能够战胜美国的飞机坦克，一定也能够战胜它的细菌武器。第二，细菌武器和别的任何武器一样，是能够防御的。细菌是要附着在别的东西上面，或者利用昆虫、动物来传播的。而这些东西都是可以消灭的。由细菌引起的传染病也是可以抵抗、预防和治疗的。我们人的身体就有许多抵抗细菌进攻的组织。比如，我们的皮肤就能挡住许多细菌不让它侵到身体里去；鼻孔里的鼻毛、粘液和粘膜能够逮住细菌；唾液和胃酸都能杀死许多细菌；我们的血液里面还有一种叫抗毒素的东西和许多白血球，都是专门杀细菌的猛将。平常，在空气中间就有不少有毒的细菌，但不是都能够使我们生病的。而且，针对敌人可能利用的各种细菌，我们还可以施行预防注射来增加身体的抵抗力。最后，细菌传到了人身上，都要经过一定的时间（这时间叫做潜伏期，从几个小时到几星期不等）才发病，在这个时候可以采取治疗的措施。总之，只要我们全国人民一致行动起来，美国侵略者的细菌战是能够被我们彻底粉碎的。
    五、问：全国人民应该怎样来反对美国侵略者的细菌战？
    答：全国人民对于美国侵略者使用细菌武器，首先是不要麻痹大意，特别是前线的部队和受过或者可能受美国侵略军的细菌武器进攻的地区的军民，大家都要提高警惕。不要以为敌人“撒几个蝇子，没有啥！”如果不加防备，就会造成损失。其次，大家也不要恐慌，因为我们在上面说过了，我们有把握战胜细菌。为了粉碎美国侵略者进行细菌战的阴谋，大家应该努力的有三点：第一、向全国人民和全世界人民宣传，彻底揭露美帝国主义的残暴无耻，团结全国人民和全世界人民共同来反对进行细菌战的美帝国主义。现在，因为中朝两国人民和全世界人民对美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行发出了怒吼，美国侵略者已经吓得发抖了，它一面还在继续使用细菌武器，一面又撒谎、狡赖，硬说他们没有撒布细菌。可是，铁案如山，美国侵略者尽管狡赖也是赖不掉的；想逃避制裁是做不到的。我们要进一步揭穿美国侵略者这种卑鄙无耻的真面目，更严重地打击它。第二、各个工作岗位上的人，要加紧自己的工作，增强抗美援朝的力量。志愿军要更加英勇作战，多消灭敌人。守卫祖国的人民解放军陆海空军，要随时警惕敌人飞机、特务的侵入。坚决执行周恩来外长三月八日的声明，把敢于到我国来滥施轰炸、撒布细菌的敌人捉住，当做战争罪犯处理。国内的人民要加紧“三反”、“五反”的斗争，做好春耕防旱工作，展开爱国增产节约运动，大力支援志愿军。只有打得美帝国主义被迫接受了和平解决朝鲜问题，大家的安全才有保障。
    第三、加强防御细菌战的宣传教育和组织准备工作。特别是全国的卫生医药工作者和敌人撒过细菌或者可能来撒布细菌的地方的军民，更应该注意这一点。防御细菌战的办法，首先是大家要组织起来，成立各级防疫机构和小组。听从卫生人员的指导，学习一些防疫知识和做一些防疫的准备。发现敌机投下昆虫、老鼠，或者投下别的东西时，一面赶紧向上级报告，一面采取紧急的防疫措施。如果敌人投下苍蝇、老鼠等，我们可以戴上手套、口罩，或者用布把头、脸包起来，扎紧袖子、裤管，把它打死，用土深埋；如果是碎布、棉花、纸屑等，赶快扫集烧掉；如果是跳蚤、臭虫等，可以用杀虫剂把它杀死。工作以后，穿的衣服也要消过毒才回家。没有消毒的设备时，可以放到锅里猛煮几滚。必要时，对敌人撒过细菌的地方要隔离开来。在海防、边防地区的军民，还要警惕敌人使用轻气球、潜水艇或派遣特务等潜入国境撒放细菌。另外，大家要注意个人卫生和公共卫生，特别要保护水源的清洁。喝水一定要煮沸。食物不要被苍蝇爬过。并且及早捕灭老鼠和虱子、跳蚤、苍蝇等害虫。同时，大家要种痘和打防疫针。生病时赶快请医生诊断。医生们如果发现了传染病或不能诊断的病症时，应赶快向卫生机关报告。只要大家注意这些工作，敌人撒下的细菌是可以扑灭的。
