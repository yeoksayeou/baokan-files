	The People's Government of Guangde County, Southern Anhui, Should Sanction Profiteers Who Monopolize the Timber Market
	Editor: Yang Yirong, a staff member of the Finance and Economics Committee of the People's Government of Guangde County, Southern Anhui, and Wan Zhiliao, a staff member of the County Industry and Commerce Section, colluded with profiteers, leaked state economic secrets, and illegally engaged in the timber business, causing great losses to the state.
	Yang Yirong had served as a puppet Bao chief before liberation and infiltrated the Finance and Economics Committee of Guangde County after liberation. Soon after taking office, he colluded with Chen Fenglin, a timber joint venture profiteer in Guangde City, and secretly informed Chen Fenglin of the news that "timber was to be frozen." Chen Fenglin took the opportunity to rush to transport more than 3,000 cubic feet of timber and chartered the Native Produce Company's more than 2,000 cubic feet of timber to Shanghai, making a huge profit of 40 to 50 million yuan. Yang Yirong also colluded with Wan Zhiliao, a staff member of the County Industry and Commerce Section, and profiteers Chen Fenglin, Yan Yunpeng, Cai Guojie, Hu Baiqing, etc., to organize a profiteering group that stole state property. In order to seek exorbitant profits, Yang and Wan used their powers to force the Guangde Timber Joint Venture and two private timber firms to shut down. Instead, Chen Fenglin and others, under their name, jointly established "Guanglin Bamboo and Timber Firm" to monopolize the market timber, and Chen Fenglin and others gave Yang and Wan "dry shares" of 4 million yuan. This profiteering group, in order to seek greater illegal profits, also convened meetings of the round timber and square timber industries through Wan Zhiliao, requiring them to close down or change careers, so that the timber market in Guangde County was monopolized by "Guanglin Bamboo and Timber Firm." Yang Yirong, on the Finance and Economics Committee side, abused his power to control all the timber in the county, only allowing "Guanglin Bamboo and Timber Firm" to buy and sell for export. He also colluded with the local telecommunications bureau director, often using telephones and telegrams to inquire about Shanghai market conditions in order to carry out large-scale theft and transportation. Within two months of its establishment, "Guanglin Bamboo and Timber Firm" made a huge profit of nearly 50 million yuan. The firm also privately purchased timber in rural areas in the name of farmers' self-production and self-sale, smuggled more than 2,100 cubic feet to Shanghai, and evaded national taxes and forestry management fees of more than 26 million yuan. The two criminals, Yang and Wan, have now been arrested. We demand that the government punish the two criminals, Yang and Wan, and the profiteer Chen Fenglin and others who engaged in speculation and profiteering, according to national law.

    皖南广德县人民政府应制裁垄断木料市场的奸商
    编辑同志：皖南广德县人民政府财政经济委员会工作人员杨义荣、县工商科科员万智辽，勾结奸商，泄露国家经济机密，非法经营木板生意，使国家受了很大损失。
    杨义荣在解放前曾当过伪保长，解放后混入广德县财政经济委员会工作。他到职不久，就和广德城内木板联营奸商陈凤林勾结，把“木板要冻结”的消息密告陈凤林。陈凤林乘机抢运木板三千多方，并包运土产公司的木板二千多方到上海，获得暴利四、五千万元。杨义荣还勾结县工商科科员万智辽，和奸商陈凤林、严运鹏、蔡国杰、胡柏青等，组织了一个盗窃国家资财的奸商集团。为了牟取暴利，杨、万两人更利用职权，迫令广德木板联营处和两家私营木行停业，另由陈凤林等出名合股开设“广林竹木行”，垄断市场木板，并由陈凤林等给杨、万二人入“干股”四百万元。这个奸商集团，为了牟取更大的非法利润，还通过万智辽，召集圆木业、方木业开会，要他们歇业或转业，使广德县木料市场由“广林竹木行”垄断起来。杨义荣则在财政经济委员会方面，滥用职权，控制全县木板，只准“广林竹木行”买卖出口。他并勾结当地电讯局主任，经常用电话、电报打听上海行情，以便进行大量盗运。“广林竹木行”成立后不及两月，就获得暴利近五千万元。该行还借农民自产自销为名，在农村中私购木板，偷运上海二千一百多方，偷漏国税和逃避林木管理费二千六百多万元。现在杨、万两犯已被逮捕。我们要求政府给杨、万两犯和进行投机倒把的奸商陈凤林等以国法制裁。
