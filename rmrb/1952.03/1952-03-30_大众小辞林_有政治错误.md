    "Popular Small Dictionary of Words" Contains Political Errors
    To the Editor: The "Popular Small Dictionary of Words" published by Shanghai Central Bookstore (edited by Yao Nailin, reprinted in April 1951) is full of errors. For example, it explains the "state," which is an organ of class rule, as "an organization with three elements: land, people, and sovereignty"; it explains "politics," which is class struggle, as "matters of state administration"; it says that the traitor Li Hongzhang, who strangled the people's revolution, was a "famous minister of the Qing Dynasty who contributed to the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion"; it says that Bulgaria, a people's democratic country, is a "constitutional country," and so on. This book sells very well in various places, especially in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas. Therefore, the harm it causes to the broad masses of the people is extremely serious. I suggest that relevant departments promptly take appropriate action regarding this book.

    “大众小辞林”有政治错误
    编辑同志：上海中央书店出版的“大众小辞林”
    （姚乃麟编、一九五一年四月再版），错误百出。例如，把阶级统治的机关的“国家”解释为“具有土地人民主权三元素的组织”；把阶级斗争的“政治”解释为“国家行政上的事务”；说绞杀人民革命的汉奸头子李鸿章是“清朝名臣，平太平天国有功”；说人民民主国家的保加利亚是“立宪国”等等。这本书在各地，特别是在中小城市和乡间，销路很广。因此，它所给予广大人民的危害，是极其严重的。我建议有关部门迅速对这本书作适当的处理。
