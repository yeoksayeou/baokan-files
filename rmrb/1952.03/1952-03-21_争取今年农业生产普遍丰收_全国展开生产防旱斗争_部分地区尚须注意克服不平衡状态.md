    To strive for a general bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, the whole country is launching a production-focused drought prevention struggle; some regions still need to pay attention to overcoming imbalances.
    [By Our Own Correspondent] Since the Government Administration Council's decision on vigorously launching a mass drought prevention and resistance movement and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instruction on ensuring the implementation of the Central People's Government Administration Council's drought prevention and resistance decision were issued, local governments at all levels and Party committees at all levels immediately carried out emergency mobilization, leading the broad masses of peasants to engage in an intense struggle for production and drought prevention.

    Currently, the three major administrative regions of North China, Northwest China, and East China, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the sixteen provinces and regions of Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaodong, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Zhejiang, Henan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu, and most of their subordinate special districts and counties, have successively established production-focused drought prevention offices or committees. They have successively convened professional meetings related to production and drought prevention, model worker meetings, and peasant representative meetings, formulating specific plans for production and drought prevention. Many responsible cadres from administrative chiefs at all levels, Party committees at all levels, and economic and enterprise departments have been transferred from the front lines of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign to the command posts for production and drought prevention.  One-quarter to one-half of the cadres from the civil affairs, agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, trade, cooperative, banking, and health departments at the provincial, special district, and county levels have been successively投入(投入: devote) into the production and drought prevention front lines.  District and township (village) cadres are concentrating all their efforts on leading the production and drought prevention work.

    Propaganda work related to production and drought prevention has also begun to unfold in various places. Propagandists, Communist Party members, Youth League members, production activists, and teachers and students in various places have participated in propaganda activities. Various localities have also made full use of propaganda tools such as newspapers, radio, propaganda posters, and slides, as well as various gathering occasions, to carry out extensive propaganda. Some places have held production and drought prevention propaganda weeks, and some places have promoted production and drought prevention blitz months, criticizing complacency and a mentality of leaving things to chance, and encouraging the masses to actively carry out drought prevention and spring plowing, in light of the ideological situation of the local masses.

    Economic and enterprise departments in various places are vigorously supplying spring plowing production materials and purchasing and selling agricultural and sideline products and local products in order to cooperate with the production and drought prevention movement. To date, a large amount of fertilizer, agricultural tools, medicines, seeds, waterwheels, etc., have been transferred to various places to supply the needs of farmers. For example, Shanxi Province has purchased and manufactured more than 76 million catties of bean cake, more than 9,300 new-style walking plows, more than 13,000 waterwheels, more than 286,000 catties of pesticides, and more than 6 million catties of improved cotton seeds, and most of them have been distributed to various places. Hebei Province has completed the purchase and processing of more than 190 million catties of bean cake, and more than 25,000 waterwheels have been produced and are being transferred to various special districts and counties. Statistics from the four provinces and regions of Shandong, Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang in East China show that more than 260 million catties of bean cake and 100 million catties of chemical fertilizer have been prepared, and another 310 million catties of bean cake are being processed and manufactured.

    Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Party, the masses of peasants in various places have organized themselves and enthusiastically launched drought prevention and spring plowing activities. The snow accumulation and ice accumulation movement launched in February in various provinces in North China, Northwest China, and Inner Mongolia and Liaodong Provinces has achieved great results. In Lingchuan and other counties in Shanxi Province, 500 villages have accumulated snow to preserve moisture on 80,000 mu of land, and in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, more than 57,000 peasants have accumulated more than 86,000 tons of snow. This movement has not only laid a favorable foundation for spring plowing and sowing, but also strengthened the confidence of farmers in the drought prevention struggle. Canal digging, well digging, and spring irrigation are also being widely carried out in various places. The Cangxian Special District of Hebei Province plans to dig 400,000 earthen wells, and 15,000 earthen wells have been dug so far; there are 11 temporary canals diverting water from the Grand Canal for irrigation, irrigating a total of 150,000 mu of land. The Baoding and Xingtai Special Districts have irrigated 244,400 mu of land in the spring, and more than a dozen other medium-sized canals in the province are preparing materials and starting construction, which can irrigate about 130,000 mu of land. The Yellow River Diversion Project in Pingyuan Province was tested on March 12 and can irrigate 400,000 mu of land. The Taizhou Special District of Zhejiang Province has completed more than 5,600 small-scale water conservancy projects, benefiting 860,000 mu of land. In addition, after thawing, plowing, harrowing, and rolling work have also been widely carried out in various places.

    However, the development of the drought prevention and spring plowing movement in various places is still very uneven. Many areas in the south have not launched the production and drought prevention movement in a timely manner. Some cadres and masses in various places in the north believe that the spring is long this year and it is still early; some people have developed complacency and a mentality of leaving things to chance after seeing several rains and snows. The drought prevention work in some areas remains at the general call stage, without putting forward different requirements according to the local situation. For example, for the masses in areas with relatively developed water conservancy, they have not yet broken their thinking that there is no threat of drought, and put forward specific requirements for improving water management, improving cultivation and irrigation techniques, expanding the area of irrigated land, and striving for a bumper harvest on all land under any drought conditions; for farmers in mountainous areas, they have not vigorously promoted moisture retention and conservation, and building dams to store water; for the economic and technical difficulties felt in general areas, they have not seized the organization of manpower and material resources and the exchange of drought prevention and resistance experience to solve them. In terms of material preparation, although certain achievements have been made, some areas have not fully estimated that after the production and drought prevention movement is launched, the masses' demands for water conservancy and spring plowing materials will be very urgent and the required quantity will be very large. Therefore, they have not paid more attention to the preparation work for production supply. In addition, some district and township (village) cadres are not active in production and drought prevention work because their hands are not clean and they are afraid of being reported by the masses in the anti-corruption struggle in the future; some masses listen to rumors, fear checking waste, and fear "eating from the big pot", and their emotions are uneasy. All of the above-mentioned ideological and work situations have produced more or less hindering effects on the development of production and drought prevention work. The production and drought prevention command departments in various places should immediately conduct persuasive education, criticize and correct erroneous ideas, and more urgently lead the masses to prevent drought, resist drought, and intensify spring plowing work, so as to strive for an agricultural bumper harvest this year.

    争取今年农业生产普遍丰收
    全国展开生产防旱斗争
    部分地区尚须注意克服不平衡状态
    【本报讯】自政务院关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定和中共中央关于保证执行中央人民政府政务院防旱、抗旱决定的指示发布以后，各地各级人民政府、中共各级党委，立即进行紧急动员，领导广大农民群众紧张地投入生产防旱的斗争。
    目前，华北、西北、华东三大行政区、内蒙古自治区、河北、平原、山西、绥远、察哈尔、热河、辽东、黑龙江、山东、苏北、皖北、浙江、河南、江西、陕西、甘肃等十六个省区及所属大部分专区和县份，先后成立了生产防旱办公室或委员会，相继召开了有关生产防旱的专业会议、劳动模范会议、农民代表会议，拟定了生产防旱的具体计划。各地各级行政首长、中共各级党委和经济、企业部门的许多负责干部已从反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的战线上调到生产防旱的指挥部来。省、专区、县各级民政、农林、水利、贸易、合作社、银行、卫生等部门先后有四分之一到二分之一的干部已投入生产防旱战线。区、乡（村）干部则集中全力领导生产防旱工作。
    有关生产防旱的宣传工作，也在各地开始展开。各地的宣传员、共产党员、青年团员、生产积极分子和教员、学生、都参加了宣传活动。各地方并充分利用报纸、广播、宣传画、幻灯等宣传工具和各种集会场合，进行广泛的宣传。有的地方举办了生产防旱宣传周，有的地方推行生产防旱突击月，针对当地群众思想情况，批判麻痹侥幸心理，鼓动群众积极进行防旱春耕。
    各地经济企业部门为了配合生产防旱运动，正大力供应春耕生产物资，收购和推销农副业产品及土产。到现在止，已有大量的肥料、农具、药剂、种子、水车等调运各地，供应农民需要。例如山西省已收购和制造豆饼七千六百多万斤、新式步犁九千三百多张、水车一万三千多部、农药二十八万六千多斤，优良棉种六百多万斤，而且大部分已分发各地。河北省已完成一亿九千多万斤豆饼的收购加工业务，水车已出厂二万五千多部，正在向各专区、县调运。华东区山东、皖北、苏北、浙江等四省区统计，已备妥豆饼二亿六千多万斤和化学肥料一亿斤，另有豆饼三亿一千万斤正在加工制造。
    各地农民群众在人民政府和党的领导下，已纷纷组织起来，热烈地展开防旱春耕活动。华北、西北各省和内蒙古、辽东省等地，在二月间展开的积雪积冰运动，已取得很大的成绩。山西省陵川等县五百个村已积雪养墒八万亩，陕西省兴平县农民五万七千多人积雪八万六千多吨。这一运动不但给春耕播种打下有利的基础，并坚定了农民防旱斗争的信心。各地开渠、打井、春浇也在广泛开展。河北省沧县专区计划打土井四十万眼，现已打成土井一万五千眼；临时开渠引运河水浇地的已有十一处，共浇地十五万亩。保定、邢台两专区已春浇二十四万四千亩，全省另有十几处中型渠道正在备料兴工，共约能浇地十三万亩。平原省引黄济卫工程已在三月十二日试水，可浇地四十万亩。浙江省台州专区已完成小型水利工程五千六百多处，受益田亩八十六万余亩。此外，解冻后，各地耕耙轧地工作也已普遍展开。
    但是，各地防旱春耕运动的发展还是很不平衡的。南方很多地区还未及时把生产防旱运动开展起来。北方各地有些干部、群众认为今年春长，现在还早；有些人看到下了几次雨雪之后，滋长了麻痹侥幸心理。有些地区防旱工作停留在一般的号召阶段，没有根据当地的情况，提出不同的要求。例如对于水利较为发达地区的群众，还没有打破他们以为没有旱灾威胁的思想，向他们提出关于改进用水管理，提高耕作及浇地技术，扩大水地面积，争取全部土地在任何干旱情况下取得丰收的具体要求；对于山区农民，也没有大力提倡养墒保墒，筑坝蓄水的工作；对于一般地区所感到的经济和技术困难，也没有抓紧组织人力物力和交流防旱抗旱经验来加以解决。在物质准备方面，虽已有了一定的成绩，但是有些地区还没有充分估计到在生产防旱运动开展之后，群众对水利、对春耕物资的要求，将会是很迫切的而且所需的数量是很大的这一情况，因此对生产供应的准备工作，还未予以更大的注意。此外，有些区、乡（村）干部因为手上不干净，害怕将来在反贪污斗争中被群众检举，对生产防旱工作不积极；还有些群众听信谣言，怕检查浪费，害怕
    “吃大锅”，情绪不安。以上这些思想情况和工作情况，对于生产防旱工作的开展，都产生了或多或少的阻碍作用。各地生产防旱指挥部门，应当立即进行说服教育，并对错误思想予以批判和纠正，更紧张地领导群众防旱、抗旱和加紧春耕的工作，争取今年的农业丰收。
