Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 20th: Mass rallies are being held across the Soviet Union condemning the crime of American aggressors using bacteriological weapons and demanding severe punishment for bacteriological warfare criminals.

    Following the protest meeting held by Moscow workers' representatives on the 13th, countless mass rallies have been held in Moscow. At a rally of thousands of people at the "Hammer and Sickle" steel plant, steelworker Subokin said: The heinous crimes of the American aggressors surpass those of the Hitlerite executioners and Japanese murderers. The Soviet people, standing at the forefront of peace fighters, demand that the American aggressors be stopped from using bacteriological weapons against Korea and China, and that the American bacteriological warfare criminals be handed over to the courts. Old textile worker Kabuskina of the Three Hills Textile Factory said at the factory's protest rally: We women account for half of the world's population. If we all raise our voices in angry protest, we can force the mad murderers to stop their atrocities. The "Paris Commune" shoe factory also held a protest rally. Stalin Prize winner Matrosov pointed out: The heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors do not prove their strength, but their weakness. Worker Mokshina delivered a moving speech. She said: My husband sacrificed himself on the front lines of the Great Patriotic War. We Soviet mothers are very aware of the horrors and burdens of war. We demand the punishment of those American cannibals who spread death and bacteria. These monstrous crimes have aroused indignation in the hearts of all Soviet men and women. The Kolomna locomotive factory in the Moscow region held a protest rally of nine thousand people. In addition, the following also held protest rallies in Moscow: Soviet scientists, medical scientists, the Stalin Automobile Factory, the "Red Proletarian" machine tool factory, the "Kalibr" gauge factory, the First Ball Bearing Factory, the Transformer Factory, the "Fighter" machine factory, the Sherbakov Silk Weaving Factory, and the Dynamo Factory.

    In Leningrad, the famous Kirov factory held a protest rally on the 17th with thousands of people participating. All the workers of the factory unanimously protested the serious crimes of the American aggressors. Soviet Supreme Soviet representative and veteran foreman of the rolling mill department of the factory, Baikov, said: The crimes committed by American imperialism are unprecedented in world history. We condemn these crimes with anger and agitation. Humanity can never forgive the American man-eating beasts. The people of Leningrad, like all the people of the Soviet Union, express brotherly sympathy to the Korean people.

    In Kiev, the Lenin Metallurgical Plant also held a mass rally on the 17th. At the meeting, the Vice Chairman of the Peace Committee of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and poet Tychyna spoke. He said: The American imperialists are dropping bombs filled with infectious disease bacteria on the peaceful cities and villages of Korea and Northeast China. While committing this crime, they are also making boastful remarks, saying that bacteriological weapons are the most suitable and cheapest weapons for destroying people. The people of the world will never forgive the American warmongers for this crime. Millions of kind men and women are raising their voices to protest the crimes of the American aggressors. Worker Kolbasina said at the meeting: "After the murderers failed in atomic diplomacy, they launched a bacteriological war. They are determined to surpass war criminals like the Hitlerite bandits. They are preparing to turn the entire world into a desert, a breeding ground for infectious diseases, and are preparing to destroy millions of peaceful people. We will never allow them to do this! A shameful failure is now awaiting the American imperialists."

    Factories, mines, railways, collective farms, and educational institutions in Armenia have also held protest rallies. Vice President of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, Naseryan, said at the Academy of Sciences conference: "It is hard to believe that in the 20th century someone could use such an evil tool of destruction as bacteriological weapons against the people; but the American cannibals who vainly attempt to dominate the world have done such a thing. They must receive the same punishment as their aggressive predecessors - the Hitlerite fascists."

    Protest rallies have also been held in Azerbaijan, Latvia, and other union republics.

    苏联全国各地纷纷举行群众抗议大会
    要求严惩撒布细菌的美国战犯
    【新华社莫斯科二十日电】苏联全国各地纷纷举行群众抗议大会，谴责美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行，要求严惩细菌战犯。
    在莫斯科劳动者代表于十三日举行抗议大会后，莫斯科已举行了无数次群众集会。在“锤子与镰刀”钢铁厂数千人的大会上，炼钢工人苏波金说：美国侵略者的骇人罪行超过了希特勒刽子手和日本杀人犯。走在和平战士最前列的苏联人民要求制止美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器，把美国细菌战犯交给法庭。三山纺织厂老女工卡布斯金娜在该厂抗议大会上说：我们妇女占世界人口的一半。如果我们都发出愤怒的抗议呼声，我们能够迫使疯狂的杀人犯停止它的暴行。“巴黎公社”鞋厂也举行了抗议大会。斯大林奖金得奖人马特罗索夫指出：美国侵略者所犯的骇人罪行，不证明它强，而证明它弱。女工莫克希纳发表了动人的讲话。她说：我的丈夫在伟大的卫国战争前线牺牲了。我们苏联的母亲们非常清楚地了解战争的恐怖与负担。我们要求惩办那些撒布死亡和细菌的美国吃人生番。这些滔天罪行在苏联全体男女心胸中激起了愤慨。莫斯科州科洛姆纳的火车头工厂举行了九千人的抗议大会。此外，在莫斯科举行抗议大会的，还有苏联科学家、医药科学家、斯大林汽车工厂、“红色无产者”母机工厂、“加利伯”测径器工厂、第一球轴承制造厂、变压器工厂、“战士”机器制造厂、谢尔巴科夫丝织厂和狄纳摩工厂。
    在列宁格勒，著名的基洛夫工厂在十七日举行了有数千人参加的抗议大会。该厂全体工人一致抗议美国侵略者的严重罪行。苏联最高苏维埃代表、该厂轧机部老领班白科夫说：美帝国主义犯的罪行是世界历史上没有过的。我们带着愤怒激动的心情斥责这些罪行。人类永不能饶恕美国吃人野兽。列宁格勒人和全苏联人民一样，对朝鲜人民表示兄弟的同情。
    在基辅，列宁冶炼厂也在十七日举行了群众大会。会上，乌克兰加盟共和国和平委员会副主席、诗人蒂奇纳讲话。他说：美帝国主义者在朝鲜及中国东北的和平城市和乡村投掷充满着传染病细菌的炸弹，他们在犯这种罪行的同时，还发表吹牛的谈话，说什么细菌武器是毁灭人民最适宜和最便宜的武器。全世界人民将决不饶恕美国战争贩子这种罪行。千百万善良的男女正扬起他们的呼声，抗议美国侵略者的罪行。女工柯尔巴西娜在会上说：“杀人犯在原子外交上遭到失败后，就进行细菌战争。他们决心要超过希特勒匪徒这类战争罪犯。他们准备把整个世界变成沙漠区、传染病的温床，准备毁灭千百万和平人民。我们决不允许他们这样做！可耻的失败现在正等待着美帝国主义者。”
    亚美尼亚的工厂、矿场、铁路、集体农场和教育机关中也纷纷举行抗议大会。亚美尼亚加盟共和国科学院副院长纳赛斯扬在科学院大会上说：“在二十世纪还有人能够用细菌武器这种罪恶的破坏工具来对待人民，这是难以令人相信的事；但是，妄想独霸世界的美国吃人生番竟做出了这样的事。他们必须受到他们的侵略前辈——希特勒法西斯分子同样的惩罚。”
    阿塞拜疆、拉脱维亚和其他加盟共和国中也纷纷举行了抗议大会。
