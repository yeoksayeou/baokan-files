    Xinhua News Agency, March 8th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, representing women across the nation, issued a statement protesting the bloody atrocities of the British government in Hong Kong in massacring our patriotic compatriots. The statement said: The British government in Hong Kong, on March 1st, dispatched large numbers of military police to systematically and methodically massacre Chinese residents in Hong Kong and to carry out large-scale arrests of our patriotic compatriots. This atrocity has aroused immense anger among women across the country. We cannot but once again warn the British imperialists: Your open provocative atrocities and your conspiracy to turn Hong Kong into a base for imperialist aggression against our country are intolerable. You shall bear full responsibility for the serious consequences of this crime. The statement sternly warns the British imperialists: The strength of Chinese women and the Chinese people is immense and cannot be trifled with. The disastrous defeat of American imperialism on the Korean battlefield serves as a lesson for you. We, the women of the entire nation, will fully support the just struggle of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong against imperialism.
