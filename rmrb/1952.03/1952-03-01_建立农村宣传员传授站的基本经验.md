    Basic Experience in Establishing Rural Propaganda Instructor Stations
    Sun Zhongwen

    Over the past year, with the development of propaganda network work, the establishment of rural propaganda instructor stations has also made great achievements. The North China region has established 7,600 instructor stations. In the rural propaganda network organizations of Hebei Province, more than half already have instructor stations. The Northeast region has 4,683 instructor stations, among which Heilongjiang Province has the most widespread distribution, with an average of one instructor station for every three and a half villages. The number of instructor stations in rural propaganda network organizations in other major administrative regions has also increased significantly. At present, many county and district party committees have attached importance to the work of instructor stations, established a system for instructor work, and can ensure regular instruction to propagandists. Therefore, in these places, the role of instructor stations in promoting rural propaganda work has begun to be seen. This is manifested in: First, county and district party committees regularly provide propaganda materials to propagandists through instructor stations. In rural areas, because the environment is dispersed, the leadership ability of general branches is relatively weak, and illiterate propagandists cannot understand written materials, so the most difficult thing for propagandists is having nothing to propagate to the masses. The timely establishment of instructor stations in various districts, and the direct oral instruction of propagandists by county and district reporters, effectively solved this difficulty. Propagandists responded: "We have the capital to propagate." "After attending classes at the station, we know a lot about national affairs and the party's policies, and we don't worry about what to propagate." Second, county and district party committees inspect and guide the work of propagandists through instructor stations, organize them to exchange experiences and learn work methods, which powerfully promotes the work of propaganda networks in various villages, improves the work ability of propagandists, and strengthens their confidence. For example, at the instructor meeting of the Xiguozhuang instructor station in Suning County, Hebei Province, the Xiguozhuang propagandists reported their successful experience in the donation of airplanes and cannons propaganda work, being able to grasp the key points, distinguish the targets, and use the people known to the masses to carry out propaganda and mobilization. The villages quickly used these experiences, powerfully promoting the donation movement. Third, county and district party committees listen to the reports of propagandists at instructor meetings, and can also understand the thoughts and demands of the masses, and then answer the masses' questions and improve their ideological awareness through the propagandists. In this way, county and district party committees can more closely contact the masses through the work of instructor stations. The above experience proves that the instructor station is not only the most basic link for county and district party committees to lead propaganda network work, but also an important key to ensuring the regularity of rural propaganda work.

    However, the number of instructor stations in various places is still too small, and the distribution is very uneven. Many instructor stations have not fully played their role. Some do not have a fixed location or a dedicated person in charge. Others only instruct once when there is a central task, and often interrupt after the central task is over. Still others only conduct instruction during the rush propaganda of National Day, the Party's birthday, and other festivals. When the central task becomes busy, instruction is interrupted instead. This cannot guarantee that the rural propaganda network will always play a role. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to simultaneously establish and strengthen instructor stations while developing and consolidating the rural propaganda network. With the arrival of the busy farming season, it is even more urgent to use instructor stations to deploy propaganda work for drought prevention, drought resistance, spring plowing, and sowing, and to lead propagandists to study propaganda methods that combine production mutual aid organizations and field labor in order to strive for agricultural output to reach and exceed pre-war levels this year. In order to develop and improve the work of instructor stations, the basic experiences of establishing instructor stations in various places over the past year are now introduced as follows:

    I. County and district party committees must attach importance to this work. This not only requires a unified understanding of the significance of the entire propaganda network work, but also requires clarifying the role of the instructor station link in strengthening propaganda network work, educating and improving propagandists, and promoting central work. It is necessary to clarify the specific tasks and specific work content of the instructor station. Without clarifying these issues, some places often oppose it to the central work, emphasize that the work is busy and troublesome, and are unwilling to manage this work, or feel that it is unrelated to the work they are doing and that they do not need to care about it. Some places also confuse instructor stations with cadre joint meetings, not only deploying administrative tasks during instruction, but also instructing propaganda content. In this way, after listening, the propagandists only remember to complete those administrative tasks, and cannot remember the propaganda content and propaganda work. As a result, the instructor station cannot play its due role. In the future, in order to avoid repeating these detours, county and district party committees should effectively discuss the significance of establishing instructor stations in connection with the actual work situation and ideological realities. They should also implement key demonstrations, lead district cadres to conduct instructor experiments, and use practical results to educate cadres. In Fushan District, Laixi County, Shandong, most district cadres lacked confidence when they first established instructor stations, believing that there was too much work and they were too busy to instruct. However, after the instructor experiment, they unanimously believed: "No matter what task or policy, as long as it is accepted by the propagandists, it will be quickly implemented among the masses." Therefore, no matter how busy they are, they can insist on regular instruction.

    II. A serious instructor work system must be established and adhered to. The district committee is responsible for directly leading the instructor station, and is primarily responsible for regularly planning, deploying, inspecting, and summarizing the work of the instructor station. In this regard, the method in Heilongjiang Province is: district cadres go to the countryside twice a month and return to the district twice. Each time they stay in the district for five days. During these five days, they report and deploy the work of the entire district, and list the deployment of instructor station work as one item during this time. When deploying instructor station work, the district committee first makes a plan based on the propaganda points instructed by the higher-level party committee, and designates reporters to prepare central speeches according to the topic, and then conducts collective discussions. This not only promotes the learning of district cadres, but also prepares for instruction. When necessary, a reporter meeting can be held separately to exchange work experience and study instructor content and methods. Some district cadres in a certain district of the province reacted that the instruction of District Chief Wang was incomprehensible to the propagandists. The district party secretary presided over a forum for reporters. At the meeting, District Chief Wang first gave an instruction speech, and then everyone discussed it. Everyone specifically pointed out what examples should be given, what kind of wording should be changed, and what issues should be paid attention to. After such specific assistance, the quality of the instruction report was greatly improved. Second, district reporters should implement a division of labor responsibility system, with one or two people in charge of an instructor station. This can strengthen the sense of responsibility, facilitate familiarity with the situation of the propagandists, and enable the instruction content to be combined with local work. Third, each district should stipulate that instruction be given regularly every half month or month, and reporters must go to the station on time to instruct. If there are special reasons for not being able to instruct on time, the reasons must be stated, the date must be changed in advance, or someone must be found to replace them temporarily. When instructors are transferred, the instructor work must be clearly handed over. Those who do not go to the station on time to instruct without reason should be given appropriate criticism, and those who are enthusiastic and responsible should be praised.

    The county party committee must strengthen inspection and leadership. Grasp the regular reports of the sub-district committees, and can issue a "District Committee Instruction Result Report Form" for each district committee to fill out and submit to the county party committee on time. The county party committee discusses the report materials on time and provides the district committee with propaganda points or speech materials on schedule. The county-level reporter's reporting objects should be divided according to the region. When going to work in their responsible areas or reporting to the masses, they must cooperate with the district reporter to directly instruct at the station and guide the work of the instructor station at any time. The propaganda department of the county party committee should send people to inspect regularly and make a summary based on the inspection materials, issue a circular, and praise those who do a good job and criticize those who lag behind.

    III. The instructor content must be thoroughly studied. The reporter responsible for instruction must study the propaganda points and materials issued by the higher authorities on the one hand, and grasp the ideological situation and practical requirements of the masses on the other hand. It is necessary to closely combine the two in order to achieve the effect of instruction. In order to collect practical materials, district reporters must establish close contact with propagandists and listen to their opinions. When working in the countryside, they must use various opportunities to understand the situation. Before instruction, the propagandists or branch committee members should make a report. By using these methods to grasp the actual situation and then explaining current affairs, policies, or work tasks in response to these situations, the instruction content can be practical, vivid, and powerful. For example, Hao Chunsheng, the district party secretary of the tenth district of Pingding County, Shanxi, learned in advance that the masses wanted to expand the report on disaster conditions and reduce the burden when instructing on autumn grain requisition propaganda work. He specifically talked about the difference between the current burden and the era of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and the great significance of this year's autumn grain requisition. After the propagandists propagated, these eight villages completed the grain requisition in two hours. When Fushan District, Laixi County, Shandong, responded to the three major calls of the China Anti-US and Aid Korea Federation last year, the understanding of the district committee and propagandists was initially vague, thinking that this donation movement was simply for money. The propagandists only told the masses that they needed money to buy airplanes and cannons, and could not explain the reasons clearly. As a result, deviations such as "squeezing" and "攤派 (tānpài: apportioning)" that were detached from the masses occurred in the donation. Later, based on the instructions from higher authorities, the district committee fully studied the policy of increasing production for donation and the content of popular speeches, and convened propagandist meetings in separate points to conduct instruction. The propagandists understood the significance of the donation and propaganda methods, and said: "The method of the higher authorities is good, and we now have a way to propagate to the masses, and we guarantee that we can propagate well." After the propagandists' propaganda, the masses successively formulated production increase donation plans. They said: "If we had known this earlier, our thinking would have been clear, and we would be willing to donate more."

    The content of instruction must also be small and refined. In order to explain the problem thoroughly, each instruction can only focus on one or two issues. Too much content, the propagandists cannot remember or digest, and it takes too long, their spirit is also easily dissipated, and it will not have a good effect.

    IV. Correct instructor methods should be mastered. The instructor methods generally used in various places now are: The first step is for the branch committee members or propagandist representatives to report on the work situation in each village in the first half of the month or last month. If there is not enough time to allocate, typical villages or people of different types can also be selected to make reports. After the report, the reporter who presides over the instructor meeting will make a simple summary, promote the good experiences, praise the model examples, and give appropriate criticism to the shortcomings and errors in the work. The second step is for the reporter to explain the instructor materials. After the explanation, the reporter will propose several discussion questions based on the explanation content. The third step is to lead the propagandists to discuss. The reporter can check the propagandists' understanding of the explanation content from the discussion, and when the propagandists have difficult problems, they can give answers at the end. There are two advantages to using this instructor method: First, the propagandists exchanged work experience before the instruction, the district reporter understood the propaganda work situation and mass reaction in each village, and gave guidance to the propagandists' work. Second, the instruction combines explanation and discussion, so that the propagandists can review and digest the instruction content, so as to truly understand the spirit of the instruction content. However, the time spent in this instructor process should not be too long, preferably two to three hours. Because too long a time will tire the propagandists and affect their production, which must be noted.

    V. After the instruction is over, the district cadres should promptly help the branch in each village to convey the instruction to all propagandists and organize all propagandists to implement it. When organizing the instructor meeting in advance, it is necessary to require that each village have backbone members such as branch secretaries, branch propaganda committee members, or propagandist representatives with a high level of political and cultural understanding, so as to ensure that they can convey the instruction content after returning to the village. After the instruction is over, the district cadres who work in the countryside should immediately go to the central village and participate in the propaganda meetings they hold to convey and deploy propaganda work. Usually living in the village, they should work on the central task on the one hand, and observe how the branch leads the propagandists' activities and how the propagandists carry out propaganda on the other hand, in order to discover problems from them and help the branch strengthen its leadership over the propagandists' work. In this way, the deputy secretary of the Tenth District Committee of Pingding County, Shanxi, used the propaganda network in Xiadonghan Village to promote the organization of seven mutual aid groups, one credit cooperative, and one production self-rescue cooperative. The masses in the village earned 47,000 jin of rice in one and a half months. In this way, the district cadres learned how to use the propaganda network to promote work, and at the same time, they could check the effect of the instruction, so as to improve the instruction work.

    建立农村宣传员传授站的基本经验
    孙衷文
    一年来，随着宣传网工作的发展，建立农村宣传员传授站的工作也有很大的成绩。华北区已建立传授站七千六百个，在河北省的农村宣传网组织中，有一半以上已有传授站；东北区有传授站四千六百八十三个，其中分布最普遍的黑龙江省平均每三个半村即有一个传授站；其他各大行政区的农村宣传网组织中，传授站的数目也增加得很多。目前许多县区党委已经重视了传授站工作，建立了传授工作制度，能够保证经常向宣传员进行传授。所以，在这些地方也就开始看到传授站在推动农村宣传工作上所发挥的作用。这表现在：首先，县、区党委通过传授站经常向宣传员供给宣传资料。在农村因为环境分散，一般支部领导能力比较弱，不识字的宣传员又看不懂文字材料，所以宣传员最感困难的是没有东西向群众宣传。各区及时地分片建立起传授站，并由县区报告员直接向宣传员进行口头传授，这就有效地解决了这个困难。宣传员反应：“宣传有本钱了。”“经过上站听课，知道许多国家大事和党的政策，宣传时不发愁了。”第二，县区党委通过传授站检查和指导宣传员的工作，组织他们交流经验，学习工作方法，这就有力地推动了各村宣传网的工作，提高了宣传员的工作能力，也加强了他们的信心。例如在河北省肃宁县西郭庄传授站的传授会上，西郭庄宣传员报告了他们在捐献飞机大炮宣传工作中，能抓住重点，分清对象，并用群众各自的知己人去宣传动员等成功经验，各村就很快地运用了这些经验，有力地推动了捐献运动。第三，县区党委在传授会上听取了宣传员的汇报，又可以了解到群众的思想和要求，并通过宣传员再去解答群众的疑难问题和提高群众的思想觉悟；这样，县区党委通过传授站的工作，又能更密切地联系群众。以上的经验证明，传授站不仅是县区党委领导宣传网工作最基本的环节，也是保证农村宣传工作经常化的一个重要关键。
    不过，目前各地传授站的数量还是太少，分布很不普遍。许多传授站尚未充分发挥作用，有的没有固定地点，也没有专人负责；也有的只是来了中心工作才传授一次，中心工作过去又往往中断；还有的只在国庆节、党的生日等节日的突击宣传时，才进行传授，中心工作忙起来，传授反而停顿。这样就不能保证农村宣传网经常起作用。所以，今后必须在发展和整顿农村宣传网当中，同时建立和加强传授站。目前农忙季节来临，更迫切需要通过传授站来布置防旱、抗旱及春耕、播种的宣传工作，并领导宣传员研究在农忙时结合生产互助组织、结合田间劳动的宣传方法，为争取农业产量在今年内达到并超过战前水平而斗争。为了发展和提高传授站的工作，现特将过去一年来各地建立传授站的基本经验介绍如下：
    一、县区党委必须重视这一工作。这不仅要求对整个宣传网工作的意义有统一的认识；而且要弄清传授站这一环节对加强宣传网工作、对教育和提高宣传员、对推动中心工作等方面的作用；要弄清传授站的具体任务和具体工作内容。不弄清这些问题，有的地方就往往把它和中心工作对立起来，强调工作忙，嫌麻烦，不愿去管这个工作，或者觉得和自己担任的工作无关，用不着自己去关心。也有的地方把传授站和干部联席会议混同起来，传授时既布置行政任务，又传授宣传内容。这样，宣传员听了以后，只记得完成那些行政任务，而没法记得那些宣传内容和宣传工作，结果传授站也就不能起它应有的作用。以后为避免再走这些弯路，县区党委应联系工作情况和思想实际把建立传授站的意义切实加以讨论；并要实行重点示范，领导区干部进行传授试验，用实际效果来教育干部；在山东莱西县的福山区，区干部在开始建立传授站时，大多没有信心，认为工作太多太忙，没有时间传授；但在经过传授试验以后，一致认为：“无论什么任务和政策，只要被宣传员接受就会很快地贯彻到群众中去。”所以他们无论工作怎样忙，都能坚持经常的传授。
    二、必须认真建立和坚持传授工作制度。区委负责直接领导传授站，首先要负责经常计划布置和检查总结传授站的工作。在这一方面，黑龙江省的办法是：区干部每月两次下乡，两次回区里，每次回区住五天，这五天汇报、布置全区的工作，就在这个时间里把布置传授站工作列为一项。在布置传授站工作时，先由区委根据上级党委指示的宣传要点做出计划，按照题目分别指定报告员准备中心发言，然后集体讨论。这样既推动了区干部的学习，又做好了传授的准备工作。在必要时，可以单独举行报告员会议，专门交流工作经验，研究传授内容和方法。该省某区有的区干部反应：该区王区长的传授，宣传员听不懂。区委书记就主持举行报告员座谈会，会上先由王区长进行传授讲话，再由大家讨论，大家就具体指出那些地方还应举什么例子，那些地方还应换个什么讲法，还应注意些什么问题等等。经过这样具体帮助，就大大提高了传授报告的质量。第二，区报告员要实行分工负责制，每一人或两人包一个传授站。这样能加强工作责任心，也便于熟悉宣传员的情况，并可使传授内容和当地工作相结合。第三，各区要酌情规定每半月或每月定期传授一次，报告员必须按时到站传授。如有特殊原因不能按时传授，得声明理由，事先通知改变日期，或者临时找人代替。在传授人调动工作时，必须把传授工作交代清楚。对无故不按时上站传授的人，要给以适当批评，对热心负责者要给以表扬。
    县委要加强检查和领导。抓紧各分区委的定期汇报，可印发“区委传授结果汇报表”，由各区委定时填写交回县委，县委根据汇报材料定时讨论，并按期供给区委宣传要点或讲话材料。县级报告员的报告对象要按地区分工，在到自己负责地区工作或向群众做报告时，必须协同区报告员到站直接传授，并随时指导传授站的工作。县委宣传部要定期派人下去检查，并根据检查材料做出总结，印发通报，对工作好的要表扬，对工作落后的要批评。
    三、必须切实研究传授内容。负责传授的报告员，一方面要对上级发下的宣传要点和材料进行研究，一方面又要掌握群众的思想情况和切身要求，必须使两者紧密结合起来，才能收到传授的效果。为了搜集实际材料，区报告员要和宣传员取得密切联系，听取他们的意见，在下乡工作时，要利用各种机会去了解情况。在传授前，应由宣传员或支部委员做汇报。通过这些方法掌握实际情况，再针对这些情况去讲解时事、政策或工作任务，才能使传授内容切合实际、生动有力。例如山西平定县第十区的区委书记郝春生在传授秋征宣传工作时，他事先了解到群众想扩大报告灾情，减少负担，他就特别讲了现在的负担和蒋匪帮统治时代有什么不同，今年的秋征有些什么重大意义。经过宣传员再去宣传，这八个村都是两小时就缴完了公粮。山东莱西县福山区在响应去年抗美援朝总会三大号召时，起初从区委到宣传员的认识都很模糊，以为这次捐献运动单纯为了要钱。宣传员只会向群众说要钱买飞机、大炮，讲不清道理。因而在捐献中产生了“挤”、“摊”等脱离群众的偏差。后来区委根据上级指示，充分研究了增产捐献方针和通俗讲话的内容，分点召开了宣传员会议，进行传授。宣传员懂得了捐献意义和宣传方法，都说：“上级这个办法好，咱这次可有办法对群众宣传了，保证能宣传得好。”经过宣传员的宣传，群众纷纷订出增产捐献计划。他们说：“早知道是这样，思想早通了，再多捐几个也愿意。”
    传授内容还必须做到少而精。为了把问题讲解透彻，每次传授只能集中讲一个或两个问题。内容过多，宣传员记不住、消化不了，费的时间太长，他们的精神也容易涣散，不会收到好的效果。
    四、应该掌握正确的传授方法。现在各地一般所用的传授方法是：第一步先由支部委员或宣传员代表汇报各村上半月或上月的工作情况。若时间不够分配，也可以抽出不同类型的典型村或人来做汇报。汇报以后，主持传授会议的报告员给做一个简单的小结，对好的经验加以推广，模范例子加以表扬，工作缺点和错误加以适当的批评。第二步是报告员进行传授材料的讲解，讲解以后，报告员根据讲解内容提出几个讨论题。第三步领导宣传员讨论。报告员可从讨论中检查宣传员对讲解内容的理解程度，发现宣传员有疑难问题时，可在最后给以解答。用这个传授方法有两个好处：第一，在传授前宣传员交流了工作经验，区报告员了解了各村宣传工作情况及群众反应，并对宣传员的工作给予指导。第二，在传授中做到讲解和讨论相结合，使宣传员对传授内容得以温习和消化，以真正领会传授内容的精神。不过，这个传授过程所费的时间不能过长，以两小时到三小时较适宜。因为时间过长，会使宣传员疲倦，也会影响他们的生产，这是必须注意的。
    五、传授结束以后，区干部要及时帮助各村支部向全体宣传员传达和组织全体宣传员加以贯彻。在事先组织传授会议时，一定得要求各村都有支部书记、支部宣传委员或有较高政治水平和文化水平的宣传员代表等骨干分子参加，以保证他们在回村以后能够传达传授内容。下乡工作的区干部在传授结束以后，应即深入到中心村，参加他们传达布置宣传工作的宣传会议。平常住在村里要一面做中心工作，一面观察支部如何领导宣传员活动，宣传员怎样进行宣传，以便从中发现问题，帮助支部加强对宣传员工作的领导。山西平定县第十区区委副书记就这样在下东寒村运用宣传网，推动组织了七个互助组，一个信贷社，一个生产自救社。该村群众一个半月就赚了四万七千斤米。这样区干部一面学会运用宣传网去推动工作，同时又可检查传授的效果，借以改进传授工作。
