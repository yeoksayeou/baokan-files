    We Have the Strength to Defeat the Bacteriological Warfare Launched by the American Aggressors
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant All Employees
    Ignoring the condemnation of the people of our country and the people of the world, American imperialism has once again spread bacteria to Northeast China. We, all the staff and workers, bitterly hate this sinful provocative act of American imperialism, which violates humanity and all international law, and we will never tolerate it.
    We have defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang fully supported by the United States, and we also have the strength to defeat any sinful provocation by American imperialism. We understand that imperialism is a mad dog, and the closer it gets to death, the more insane and vicious it becomes. This sinful provocative act of American imperialism is not a manifestation of its strength, but a reflection of its death throes. When Japanese imperialism and the Hitlerite bandits were dying, they both used poison gas and bacteria, but this did not save them from death. American imperialism has concentrated its most elite troops, and its supposedly powerful air force and navy, in Korea, but they have all been defeated by the heroic Chinese and Korean People's forces. We drove them from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel. American imperialism has been defeated on the battlefield, and it has no reason on its side. It is afraid of the success of the armistice negotiations, afraid of the growth of world peace forces, and afraid of the increasing strength of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, so it dreams of using bacteriological warfare to salvage its impossible defeat.
    The sinful actions of American imperialism will inevitably isolate it further, and will inevitably arouse greater hatred for it among the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world.
    We want to warn the warmongers of Wall Street that we love peace, we are determined to defend peace, and we have the strength to punish all war criminals. We have 475 million united people, we have the world's first-class powerful army, and we have a powerful air force and artillery. Our national defense strength is increasing rapidly. Take our factory as an example: pig iron production has increased many times over before liberation. Peace-loving people all over the world are with us, the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union exceeds the strength of the imperialist aggression camp, and the movement to defend peace has become a worldwide movement. If the American warmongers do not immediately stop spreading bacteria and expanding the bloody crimes of war, we will certainly beat them until their heads are broken and bleeding.
    Workers and brothers of the whole country, patriotic compatriots, let us take active action, step up production, step up the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and use our practical actions to fight back against the sinful provocative acts of American imperialism.

    我们有力量打败美国侵略者进行的细菌战争
    石景山钢铁厂全体职工
    美帝国主义不顾我国人民和世界人民的声讨，竟然又把细菌撒布到我国东北来了。对于美帝国主义这种违反人道、违反一切国际公法的罪恶的挑衅行为，我们全体职工切齿痛恨，我们决不能容忍。
    我们曾经战胜过日本帝国主义和美国全力支持下的国民党匪帮，我们也有力量战胜美帝国主义的任何罪恶的挑衅。我们懂得：帝国主义是一条疯狗，它越接近死亡，就越发疯狂和毒辣。美帝国主义这种罪恶的挑衅行为，不是它的强大、而是它的垂死挣扎的表现。当日本帝国主义和希特勒强盗垂死的时候，都曾使用过毒瓦斯和细菌，但是，这并没有能挽救它们的死亡。美帝国主义在朝鲜集中了最精锐的部队，和自以为强大的空军和海军，却都被英雄的中朝人民部队打败了。我们把他们从鸭绿江赶到三八线附近。美帝国主义在战场上吃了败仗，讲理又没理，它害怕停战谈判的成功，害怕世界和平力量的增长，害怕中朝人民部队力量日益强大，于是梦想用细菌战来挽救它不可能挽救的失败。
    美帝国主义的罪恶行为，必将使它更加陷于孤立，必将激起中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民对它更大的仇恨。
    我们要警告华尔街的战争贩子们，我们热爱和平，我们有决心保卫和平，我们有力量惩罚一切战争罪犯。我们有四亿七千五百万团结一心的人民，我们有世界上第一流的强大的陆军，我们有强大的空军和炮兵。我们的国防力量是一日千里地增强着。就拿我们这个工厂说吧：生铁产量比解放前提高了许多倍。全世界爱好和平人民和我们在一起，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量超过了帝国主义侵略阵营的力量，保卫和平运动已形成全世界的运动。如果美国战争贩子们不立即停止撒布细菌和扩大战争的血腥罪行，我们必定打得他们头破血流。
    全国的工人兄弟们，爱国同胞们，我们要积极行动起来，加紧生产，加紧抗美援朝工作，用我们的实际行动来回击美帝国主义罪恶的挑衅行为。
