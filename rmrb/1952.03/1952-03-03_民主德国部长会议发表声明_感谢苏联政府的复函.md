Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 1st: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on February 28th, welcoming and thanking the Soviet government for its reply to the German Democratic Republic government's request for accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. In its reply, the Soviet government guaranteed that "In view of the great significance of concluding a peace treaty with Germany for strengthening peace in Europe, the Soviet government is willing to do its utmost to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and restore the unification of Germany."

    The Council of Ministers' statement pointed out that aggressive forces hope to use the fact that a peace treaty has not yet been concluded and the divided state of Germany to launch another war. Accelerating the conclusion of a peace treaty will mean maintaining peace in Europe and establishing a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

    The statement said: "The Soviet government's reply fills the hearts of the German people with hope and enthusiasm. This is new evidence of the Soviet government's consistent and friendly assistance to the German people in their efforts to peacefully resolve their vital issues."

    The statement also expressed the hope that the other three major powers exercising control in Germany could also give a positive reply to the German Democratic Republic's letter and take steps to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the reconstruction of a unified Germany.

    民主德国部长会议发表声明
    感谢苏联政府的复函
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国部长会议在二月二十八日发表声明，表示欢迎和感谢苏联政府对于德意志民主共和国政府关于加速缔结对德和约的要求的答复。苏联政府在这个答复中保证：“鉴于缔结对德和约对于加强欧洲和平有着最伟大的意义，苏联政府愿尽其所能加速缔结对德和约，并恢复德国的统一。”
    部长会议的声明指出：侵略势力希望利用尚未缔结和约的事实和德国的分裂状态，发动另一次大战。加速缔结和约将意味着保持欧洲和平，同时建立统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的德国。
    声明说：“苏联政府的答复使德国人民心中充满了希望和热情。这是苏联政府始终友好地援助德国人民努力以和平方法解决他们的切身重要问题的新证据。”
    声明并表示希望在德国施行管制的其他三大国也能对德意志民主共和国的公函给予肯定的答复，并采取步骤以加速缔结对德和约和重建统一的德国。
