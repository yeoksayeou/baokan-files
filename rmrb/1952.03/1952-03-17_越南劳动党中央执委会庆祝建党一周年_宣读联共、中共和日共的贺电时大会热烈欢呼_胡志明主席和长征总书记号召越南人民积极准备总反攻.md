Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 12th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, to commemorate the first anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the merger of "Viet Minh" and "Viet Lien" into the Vietnam National United Front, and the establishment of the United National Unified Front of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party held a commemorative meeting on March 3. The meeting was presided over by President Ho Chi Minh. The meeting elected Marshal Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, Comrade Thorez, and General Kim Il-sung as honorary presidium members, and elected President Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Vietnam National United Front Ton Duc Thang, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam National United Front Father Pham Ba Truc, and General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party Truong Chinh as the presidium. Representatives from the Government of Vietnam, the National Assembly, the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, the Vietnam Democratic Party, the Vietnam Socialist Party, various people's organizations, various ethnic minorities, and the People's Army units on the Peace City front attended the meeting.

　　Amidst enthusiastic cheers, telegrams of congratulations from the CPSU (Bolsheviks), the Communist Party of China, and the Japanese Communist Party were read. After President Ho Chi Minh delivered the opening speech, General Secretary Truong Chinh delivered a report.

　　Truong Chinh reported in detail on the great achievements made by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party in the past year in strengthening the united front, military struggle, economic finance, cultural education, and diplomacy. Truong Chinh pointed out that the Vietnamese people were able to achieve these achievements due to: 1. The Vietnamese people are closely united in the Vietnam National United Front, and the Vietnamese people's high patriotic enthusiasm and firm determination to fight for independence; 2. The correct leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Government of Vietnam; 3. The support of the world peace and democracy camp.

　　After analyzing the increasingly powerful international situation of the peace and democracy camp and the increasingly corrupt imperialist camp, Truong Chinh said: Our war of resistance is a long-term struggle. In order to prepare for the general counter-offensive, on the one hand, we should annihilate more enemies, consume and weaken the enemy's strength, and on the other hand, we must preserve and strengthen our strength to prepare for the transition to the general counter-offensive when all necessary conditions are met. Our plan is to carry out a long-term war of resistance and long-term preparations. We should never abandon the idea of ​​long-term war of resistance and self-reliance.

　　Truong Chinh finally put forward three major tasks to all the Vietnamese people and all members of the Labor Party: 1. Annihilate more enemy troops and strengthen guerrilla warfare; 2. Crush the enemy's conspiracy of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to kill Vietnamese"; 3. Strengthen and cultivate the anti-resistance forces of the Vietnamese people.

　　In his speech at the end of the conference, President Ho Chi Minh pointed out that under the circumstances that the international and domestic situations are all favorable to Vietnam, the struggle of the Vietnamese people will surely be victorious, because they have the correct leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, a Vietnam National United Front, and an army of the people.

　　The conference ended in enthusiastic cheers and shouts of "Long live President Ho Chi Minh" and "Long live the Vietnam Workers' Party".

    宣读联共、中共和日共的贺电时大会热烈欢呼
    胡志明主席和长征总书记号召越南人民积极准备总反攻
    【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社北越十二日消息：为纪念越南劳动党建党、“越盟”和“越联”合并为越南国民联合战线以及越南、寮国、高棉三国成立联合民族统一战线一周年，越南劳动党中央执行委员会在三月三日举行了纪念大会。大会由胡志明主席主持。大会推选了斯大林大元帅、毛泽东主席、多列士同志和金日成将军为名誉主席团，并推选了胡志明主席、越南国民联合战线主席孙德胜、越南国民联合战线副主席范伯直神父以及越南劳动党总书记长征为主席团。参加大会的有越南人民政府、国民议会、越南国民联合战线全国委员会、越南民主党、越南社会党、各人民团体、各少数民族以及和平城前线人民军部队的代表。
    大会在热烈的欢呼声中宣读了联共（布）党、中国共产党和日本共产党的贺电。胡志明主席致开会词后，由长征总书记作报告。
    长征详细报告了越南劳动党领导下的越南人民一年来在加强统一战线、军事斗争、经济财政、文化教育以及外交等各方面的巨大成就。长征指出越南人民能够获得这些成就是由于：一、越南人民紧密地团结在越南国民联合战线之中，越南人民的高涨的爱国热情和争取独立的坚决意志；二、胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南人民政府的正确领导；三、世界和平民主阵营的支持。
    长征在分析和平民主阵营日益强大、帝国主义阵营日益腐朽的国际形势以后说：我们的抗战是一个长期斗争。为了准备总反攻，一方面我们应该歼灭更多敌人，消耗并削弱敌人的力量，另一方面也要保存和加强我们的力量，以准备在一切必需条件具备时，转入总反攻。我们的计划是进行长期抗战和长期准备。我们决不应该放弃长期抗战和自力更生的思想。
    长征最后向全越南人民和劳动党全体党员提出三大任务：一、歼灭更多敌军并加强游击战；二、粉碎敌人的“以战养战”和“利用越南人杀越南人”的阴谋；三、加强并培养越南人民的抗战力量。
    胡志明主席在大会结束时的讲话中指出：在国际、国内形势都对越南有利的情况下，越南人民的斗争必将得到胜利，因为他们有越南劳动党的正确领导，有一个越南国民联合战线，并有一支人民的军队。
    大会在热烈欢呼声中和高喊“胡志明主席万岁”和“越南劳动党万岁”的口号声中结束。
