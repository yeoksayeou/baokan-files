    "Patriot"
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Qing Zhao
    In the motor vehicle transport lines on the Korean battlefield, there is a "Patriot" truck. The birth and experiences of this truck vividly embody the diligence, bravery, and love for the motherland's property of the volunteer army's logistics soldiers.
    In March of last year, when the blocking war on the Han River front was raging, the soldiers on the transportation lines used practical actions of cherishing vehicles and materials and vigorously supporting the front lines to cooperate with the battle. The leading cadres of a certain unit's automobile repair company decided to organize a group of people to collect machine parts from enemy vehicles abandoned on the battlefield and assemble them into new vehicles to increase transport capacity. This arduous task was assigned to Deputy Platoon Leader Li Zhicai and nineteen Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. They marched over a hundred li overnight to reach the work area. There, they found a house and used that cold little thatched cottage as their housing and the address of their "Resist America, Aid Korea Automobile Manufacturing Plant."
    The first step was to collect materials – from the frame and tires of the vehicles to every small screw. Every day at dawn, they would go out in groups of two or three to search the snowy mountain gullies, riverbanks, and roads with the determination of "not returning without finding materials." In the first few days, they could still find some broken cars near their housing; later, they had to run further and further, often climbing forty or fifty li of mountains a day, wading through several icy rivers; sometimes they even had to risk their lives to find one or two pieces of material. Communist Party member Wen Dehan spent five days and climbed more than 150 li of mountain roads to find a fuel tank switch from a destroyed enemy tank. Communist Youth League members Xu Zhuqian and Lu Zhigang found a broken car and also discovered a time bomb dropped by an enemy plane there. The two brave soldiers unhesitatingly moved the time bomb away first, and then climbed into the truck bed to disassemble the parts. Under the car was a small river that was still covered with thin ice. They endured the biting cold, not caring that their clothes were soaked by the river water, nor that their hands stuck to the iron pieces when they touched them. They worked from dawn until late at night. Sometimes their hands would freeze quickly, so the two of them would huddle together tightly, putting their hands into each other's sleeves to warm up. Sometimes when it got too cold to bear, they would run back and forth on the riverbank until their bodies warmed up a little, and then they would return to their original place and continue working. After seven days of hard work, they overcame many difficulties and finally collected most of the materials, but they were still missing some electrical wire. Just as they were getting anxious, an enemy plane that had been shot down happened to crash near their residence, which solved their remaining difficulties.
    Then they began the work of assembling the car, with the open space as their "factory." Whenever the moon appeared on the mountain peaks, they would work intensely, singing: "The open-air factory has a skylight, we start work as soon as the moon comes out; comrades, let's work hard to become new heroes!" The hammers rang out clangingly, and the bellows roared. Youth League member Zhang Hanji, who had just recovered from a shoulder injury, swung the sledgehammer while singing: "Clang, clang, clang, my hammer is powerful; the little devils dropped some scrap iron, the volunteer army will hammer it into steel, do you think our ambition is strong!" Zhang Peiqing, who was pulling the bellows, responded: "Strong! Our ambition is stronger than steel!"
    In these days of selfless labor, their eyes became bloodshot, and their bodies became thinner, but after more than ten days, a new car was finally assembled. This was the fruit forged with drops of blood and sweat, after enduring countless days and nights of hardship! They looked at the car, caressed it, and discussed what name to give it to commemorate it, as if a mother was gazing affectionately at her baby. Some said: "This is American raw materials made by the volunteer army, let's call it 'Foreign Materials, Indigenous Manufacturing'." Some said, "Let's call it 'Resist America, Aid Korea'." Everyone felt that these meanings were not enough. Finally, Deputy Platoon Leader Li Zhicai said: "Comrades, the car we assembled is an increase in wealth for the motherland, and it can also be said that our volunteer army can ask the people of the motherland for less money; why should we be so careful and economical for the motherland? Because we are soldiers who love the motherland, so this car should be called 'Patriot'." To commend these soldiers who loved the motherland, the higher-level leading organs awarded merit to the comrades who assembled this "Patriot" truck.
    The "Patriot" truck quickly joined the transportation line. Deputy Platoon Leader and Communist Party member Yin Junshan, who was driving this truck, knew the extraordinary birth history of this truck, and he was determined to perform meritorious service for the people of the motherland while driving this glorious truck. In the arduous and busy transportation tasks, a strong sense of responsibility often moved him. One day, when he was tired from driving, he jumped out of the car and scooped up river water to wash his bloodshot eyes; in winter, he grabbed a handful of snow to wipe his face, or opened the car window to let the biting cold wind clear his head. When he stopped to rest, he wiped and inspected the car regardless of fatigue, pouring all his energy into this car.
    One autumn night last year, he and his assistant Chen Ning were driving the truck to transport grain to the front line. In a certain place, they were spotted by the enemy. The enemy planes dropped flares, followed by a burst of machine-gun fire. The car was not hit, and he stepped on the accelerator and drove wildly. The enemy plane chased after them and fired another burst of machine-gun fire, hitting the tarpaulin covering the truck bed. Smoke and fire rushed into the cab, and Yin Junshan immediately stopped the car and told Chen Ning to rush to the truck bed and lift off the burning tarpaulin. At this time, he was hit by bullets in two places on his head and legs, and the serious injuries caused him to faint immediately. Chen Ning carried him down, bandaged his wounds, and turned around to put out the fire on the car. Three enemy planes were still bombing and strafing, and Yin Junshan woke up and shouted: "Chen Ning, drive out!" Chen Ning hesitated and asked: "Platoon Deputy, what about you!" "Don't worry about me, good comrade, you are a Communist Youth League member, the car and supplies are important! Hurry! You must be worthy of the motherland!" Chen Ning, with tears in his eyes, covered the platoon deputy with his coat, started the car, and rushed out.
    Yin Junshan was subsequently rescued by fraternal troops and taken to the hospital for surgery. The next day, the regimental political commissar and instructor came to visit him. His first sentence was: "Did Chen Ning drive the car to the front line? Were there any losses to the car and grain?" The instructor told him that the car and grain had safely reached the front line and handed him a certificate of merit. At this time, he forgot the pain of his wounds and smiled contentedly.
    When I visited this "Patriot" truck, which was full of honor, the owner proudly said to me: "This truck has already run 20,000 kilometers, and we will continue to let it run, until the victory of Resist America, Aid Korea, and then drive it back to the motherland to serve the motherland's production and construction!"

    “爱国号”
    新华社记者  庆肇
    在朝鲜战场上的汽车运输行列里，有一辆“爱国号”汽车，这辆汽车的诞生和它的经历，是志愿军后勤战士们勤劳勇敢，热爱祖国财产的生动体现。
    去年三月，正当汉江前线的阻击战打得火热的时候，运输战线上的战士们用爱护车辆物资，大力支援前线的实际行动来配合作战。某部汽车修理连的领导干部决定组织一批人到战场上去收拾敌人遗弃的汽车上的机件，装备成新的汽车，以增加运输力量。这个艰巨的任务交给了副排长李志才和十九名共产党员、青年团员。他们一夜急行百余里，赶到了工作地区。他们在那里找到了一间房子，并把那间寒冷的小茅屋当做他们的住房和“抗美援朝汽车修造厂”的厂址。
    第一步工作就是要收集材料——从汽车的骨架、轮胎到每一枚小螺丝钉。每当天一亮，他们便抱着“找不到材料不回来”的决心，三三两两地到积雪的山沟里、小河边和公路上去寻找。开头几天，他们在住房附近还可以找到一些破汽车；后来就越跑越远，往往一天要爬四五十里的山，涉几道冰河；有时甚至要冒着生命的危险，才能找到一两件材料。共产党员温德汉为了找一个油箱开关，就花费了五天功夫，爬了一百五十多里的山路，才从被炸毁了的敌人的战车上找到。青年团员徐祝千和鲁志刚找到了一辆破汽车，同时也发现了那里有一颗敌机扔下来的定时炸弹。这两个勇敢的战士毫不犹豫地先将定时炸弹搬走，然后爬到车箱下去拆卸零件。汽车底下是一道还结着薄冰的小河，他们忍受着刺骨的寒冷，不管衣服被河水打湿，也不管双手触到铁片上时和铁黏在一起，从白天一直干到深夜。有时手快冻僵了，两个人便紧紧地挨着，彼此把手伸进对方的袖手里取暖。有时实在冷得支不住了，他们就在河岸上来回跑步，一直到身上暖和了一点，就又回到原地干起来。他们经过了七天的辛劳工作，克服了许多困难，终于把大部分的材料都收齐了，但是还缺少一样电线。他们正在发急，凑巧有一架被击中的敌机迳直跌落在他们的驻地附近，这样就解决了他们剩下的困难。
    他们接着就开始了装车工作，空地就是他们的“工厂”。每当月亮在山峰上露脸的时候，他们就紧张地工作起来，并且唱着：“露天工厂有天灯，月亮一出就开工；同志们干哪，争取当新英雄！”锤子叮当地响着，风箱也呼啦啦地叫起来。左肩负伤刚好的青年团员张汉吉一边舞动着大锤，一边唱：“叮叮当，叮叮当，我的铁锤有力量；小鬼子扔下些破烂铁，志愿军要把它锤成钢，你说我们志气强不强！”拉着风箱的张佩庆就接着应声道：“强！我们的志气赛金钢！”
    在这忘我地劳动的日子里，他们的眼睛熬红了，身体消瘦了，但是十多天后，一辆新汽车终于装成了。这是忍受了多少日日夜夜的辛劳艰苦，用一滴血一滴汗铸造出来的果实啊！他们好似母亲爱抚地注视着自己的婴儿一般，围着车子，瞧着它，抚摸它，并且商量着要给汽车取个名字作纪念。有的说：“这是美国原料志愿军制造，就叫它‘洋料土造’号吧”。有的说“叫它‘抗美援朝’号吧。”这些大家都觉得意思还不够，最后副排长李志才说：“同志们，我们装起的这辆车子，对祖国来说就是增加了一笔财富，也可以说我们志愿军就可以向祖国人民少要一笔钱；为什么我们要这样为祖国精打细算呢，因为我们是热爱祖国的战士，所以这辆车应该叫做‘爱国号’。”为了表彰这些热爱祖国的战士，上级领导机关给装配这辆“爱国号”汽车的同志都记了功。
    “爱国号”汽车很快就参加到运输战线上来。驾驶这辆车子的副排长共产党员尹君山知道这辆车子的不平凡的诞生史，他也决心要在驾驶这辆光荣的车子中为祖国人民立功。在艰苦繁忙的运输任务中，一种强烈的责任感经常激动着他。一天行车疲劳了，他跳下车来掬起河水洗洗熬红了的眼睛；冬天就抓把雪擦擦脸，或者打开车窗让刺骨的寒风来清醒一下自己。停车休息了，他不顾疲劳地擦拭和检查车子，他把自己的全部心血都贯注在这辆车子上。
    去年秋天的一个月夜里，他和助手陈宁两人驾驶着车子往前线运送粮食。在某地，他们被敌人发现了目标。敌机扔下了照明弹，接着就是射来一梭子机枪子弹。车子并没有被打中，他不顾一切地加足了马力猛开。敌机追上来又一梭机枪子弹，打着护车箱上的篷布。烟火冲进了驾驶室，尹君山立即停下车，叫陈宁扑上车箱掀去着火的篷布。这时他头上和腿部两处中弹，严重的伤势使他当时就昏了过去。陈宁把他背下来，包扎了伤口，转身又扑灭了车上的火。三架敌机仍在轰炸扫射着，尹君山苏醒过来就叫：“陈宁，开车冲出去！”陈宁迟疑地问：“排副哪，你呢！”“不要管我，好同志，你是个青年团员，车子和物资要紧！快！要对得起祖国！”陈宁含着热泪，把大衣盖在排副身上，开起车子就冲了出去。
    尹君山随后被兄弟部队抢救到医院里施行了手术。第二天，团政治委员和指导员都跑来慰问他。他第一句话就问：“陈宁把车开到前线了吗？车子和粮食没有损失吗？”指导员告诉他车子和粮食都安全地到了前线，并且把一张功劳奖状交给了他。这时，他忘记了伤口的疼痛，满意地微笑起来了。
    在我访问这辆满载着荣誉的“爱国号”汽车时，主人自豪地对我说：“这车子已经跑了两万公里了，我们还要叫它跑下去，一直跑到抗美援朝胜利，还要开回祖国为祖国的生产建设服务！”
