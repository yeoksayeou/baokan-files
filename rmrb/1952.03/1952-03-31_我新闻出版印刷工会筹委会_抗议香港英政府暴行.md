Xinhua News Agency, March 30th:

    The British government in Hong Kong illegally summoned ten people on March 20th, 21st, and 24th, including Fei Yimin, owner and printer of the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao; editor Li Zongying; Weng Zhaofen, owner of the New Evening News; printer Guo Yongwei; editor Lu Fu; and Mei Wending, chairman of the Wen Wei Po; printer Yu Hongxiang; and editor Li Zisong, and sent them to court for trial. The British government in Hong Kong accused the above-mentioned newspapers of truthfully publishing on March 5th the news that the people of the motherland had lodged serious protests against the crimes of the British government in Hong Kong for massacring Chinese residents. The British government in Hong Kong accused them of "violating the Hong Kong British government's ordinance to prevent incitement to rebellion." Fan Changjiang, director of the Preparatory Committee of the National News Publication and Printing Workers' Union, issued a statement on the 30th, expressing serious protest against this barbaric act of the British government in Hong Kong, which unreasonably persecutes Chinese journalists and conspires to destroy the Chinese people's news undertakings in Hong Kong. The statement is as follows:
    I, on behalf of all news, publication, and printing workers in China, express serious protest against the barbaric act of the British government in Hong Kong in illegally "summoning" and "trying" ten Chinese journalists in Hong Kong. It is entirely reasonable for Chinese journalists in Hong Kong to truthfully publish reports on the protests of the people of the motherland against the reactionary crimes of the British government in Hong Kong in massacring Chinese people. The British government in Hong Kong's persecution of them fully exposes that the British government in Hong Kong has violently trampled on the principle of freedom of the press, and once again proves that British imperialism is following the aggressive policy of US imperialism and openly antagonizing the Chinese people. I solemnly warn that the British government in Hong Kong must immediately stop this violent and unreasonable behavior.

    抗议香港英政府暴行
    【新华社三十日讯】香港英国政府在三月二十、二十一和二十四日连续非法传讯香港大公报东主和督印人费彝民、编辑李宗瀛、新晚报东主翁兆芬、督印人郭永伟、编辑卢富，以及文汇报董事长梅文鼎、督印人余鸿翔、编辑李子诵等十人，并送往法院审讯。香港英国政府指控的罪名是上述各报在三月五日据实发表了祖国人民对香港英国政府屠杀中国居民的罪行提出严重抗议的消息，香港英国政府指控这是“触犯香港英国政府防止煽动叛乱则例”。对于香港英国政府这种无理迫害中国新闻工作者和阴谋摧残中国人民在香港的新闻事业的野蛮举动，中国新闻出版印刷工会筹备委员会主任范长江在三十日特发表声明，提出严重抗议。声明如下：
    我代表全中国的新闻出版印刷工作者，对香港英国政府非法“传讯”及“审讯”在香港的中国新闻工作者十人的野蛮举动，表示严重抗议。在香港的中国新闻工作者据实地发表了关于祖国人民对香港英国政府屠杀中国人民的反动罪行提出抗议的报道，是完全合理的，而香港英国政府对他们横施迫害，这就充分暴露了香港英国政府横暴地蹂躏了新闻自由的原则，并且又一次证明英帝国主义追随美帝国主义的侵略政策，公然与中国人民为敌。我严正地提出警告，香港英国政府必须立即停止这种横暴无理的行为。
