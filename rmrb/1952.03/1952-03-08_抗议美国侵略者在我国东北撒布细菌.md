    Protest Against American Aggressors Spreading Bacteria in Our Northeast
    The People's Daily published news of American bandits spreading bacteria in our Northeast. This fact has aroused even greater anger in us.
    All justice-loving people around the world unanimously condemn this shameless crime of American imperialism. The American aggressors cannot achieve victory on the Korean battlefield, nor can they achieve their aggressive goals from the armistice talks, so now they want to use germ warfare to intimidate us. But the Chinese people cannot be intimidated, and the atrocities of the United States can only arouse our infinite anger. We lodge a serious protest against the bestial behavior of the American bandits, and we guarantee to do a good job in the anti-corruption, anti-embezzlement, and anti-bureaucratism movement, do a good job in production, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers.
        All Employees of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau

    抗议美国侵略者在我国东北撒布细菌
    人民日报刊载了美国强盗在我国东北撒布细菌的消息。这一事实引起我们更大的愤怒。
    全世界有正义感的人民，一致谴责美帝国主义者这种无耻的罪行。美国侵略者不能在朝鲜战场上取得胜利，又不能从停战会议中达到侵略的目的，他现在就想用细菌战来威吓我们。但是中国人民是吓不倒的，美国的暴行只能引起我们无限的愤怒。我们对美国强盗这种野兽行为提出严重的抗议，并保证搞好反贪污、反盗窃运动，做好生产工作，支持中国人民志愿军。        北京电业局全体职工
