North China Region's Experiences in Drought-Resistant Sowing in 1951
(Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report)

Spring sowing is a major part of the agricultural production process. Whether sowing is timely or not is closely related to crop yield.

Spring drought frequently occurs in North China. In order to sow in a timely manner, preventing drought and preserving soil moisture, and drought-resistant sowing have become important tasks in agricultural production in North China. Last year, North China suffered from severe spring drought. The cotton fields sown using drought-resistant methods accounted for 70 percent of the total sown area in the region. Taking each province as an example, in Hebei last year, drought-resistant sowing of cotton fields accounted for 69 percent of the total sown area. According to statistics from Pingyuan Province in mid-May last year, out of 6.8 million mu of cotton sown, about 6 million mu were sown using drought-resistant methods. In Shanxi Province, 12.97 million mu of crops were sown using drought-resistant methods last year, accounting for more than 33 percent of the province's spring sowing area.

Precisely because North China frequently experiences spring drought, farmers in some areas have accumulated a lot of experience in drought-resistant sowing during the spring drought struggle. Especially last year, in the patriotic production increase movement, the broad masses of farmers in North China further developed methods of drought-resistant sowing.

Seizing Soil Moisture and Borrowing Soil Moisture, and Carrying Water for Spot Planting are the Two Main Methods of Drought-Resistant Sowing

The main method of drought-resistant sowing is seizing soil moisture and borrowing soil moisture. This method was widely used in cotton planting last year. In Hebei Province, more than half of the cotton fields were sown using this method last year.

Seizing soil moisture and borrowing soil moisture means seizing the opportunity when the soil contains a certain amount of moisture for spring sowing. The biggest advantage of seizing soil moisture and borrowing soil moisture is high efficiency. Last year, Xiguyi Village, Ci County, Hebei, planted 800 mu of cotton using drought-resistant methods. Using the method of seizing soil moisture and borrowing soil moisture, the task was completed in seven days. Farmers in Jiyuan, Meng County, Qinyang and other counties in Pingyuan Province took advantage of the soil moisture to rush planting and quickly completed their sowing plans.

Based on the experience of drought-resistant sowing in several areas of North China last year, in seizing soil moisture and borrowing soil moisture, it is very important to check the soil moisture, grasp the soil conditions, seize the opportunity, and sow in a timely manner. Last year, some cadres and farmers in Wu'an County, Hebei, lacked experience at the beginning of cotton planting. They did not pay enough attention to seizing soil moisture for planting. They simply adopted the method of spot planting when the soil moisture allowed for drilling, resulting in a waste of manpower and failure to complete the plan on time. The original plan was to plant 450,000 mu of cotton, but only 20,000 mu were planted by April 20th. Farmers in some villages in Ci County, Hebei Province, believed that the method of seizing soil moisture and borrowing soil moisture was not reliable and were unwilling to adopt it, resulting in a delay in planting in good soil moisture conditions. Taking Lintan Town as an example, this town originally had 300 mu of land with good soil moisture that could be sown, but after a few days' delay, only 70 mu of land could be sown by seizing soil moisture. One of the reasons why Quzhou County, Hebei Province, overfulfilled its drought-resistant sowing task in late April last year was the implementation of the policy of "seizing soil moisture first, then spot planting," which enhanced the efficiency of drought-resistant sowing.

In seizing soil moisture and borrowing soil moisture for sowing, in order to increase the moisture needed for seed emergence, many farmers, in addition to widespread seed soaking, also soaked sorghum stalks, corn cobs, etc., until they were full of moisture (one section of sorghum stalk can absorb one or two liang of water), and sowed them into the soil along with the seeds. Farmers in Yinjiafan Village, Lingshou, Hebei, adopted this method, and all 300 mu of cotton fields sown using drought-resistant methods produced seedlings.

The prerequisite for seizing soil moisture for sowing is that the fields have good soil moisture. The main methods of preserving soil moisture in many areas of North China are plowing and harrowing in autumn, and harrowing early in spring, and making sure to harrow frequently and carefully, so that the soil maintains a certain amount of moisture and reduces moisture evaporation. Harrowing is a necessary task in the current drought prevention and resistance movement.

In addition to seizing soil moisture and borrowing soil moisture, another drought-resistant sowing method is carrying water for spot planting. This method can be used in areas that are too dry and lack soil moisture. About one-quarter of the cotton sown using drought-resistant methods in Hebei last year was sown using this method.

The disadvantage of this method is that the sowing efficiency is low and it requires a lot of labor. To adopt this method, it is necessary to give full play to the organized strength, prepare enough tools for drawing water, carrying water, and storing water in advance, and reasonably organize manpower. Last year, in order to conduct organized and planned drought-resistant spot planting, 52 villages including Dongtangwang Village in Wuqiang County, Hebei Province, organized 556 mutual aid teams, dug 60 earthen wells, and prepared 3,290 buckets and 30 large gasoline drums. Farmers in Dahanji Village, Fangshan County, in order to prepare for drought-resistant spot planting last year, organized water-drawing teams and water-carrying teams with buckets, carts, and livestock as early as early April. In Daming County, all farmers in the county, in addition to digging earthen wells, used all the tools that could hold and transport water—wooden ladles, basins, tin cans, oil baskets, water tanks, carts, etc.—to participate in drought-resistant sowing. They made sure that people, livestock, carts, and water-holding tools were "all busy."

Because carrying water for spot planting requires a lot of water, it is necessary to strive to maximize the effectiveness of water when spot planting, and also pay attention to saving water in areas with insufficient water sources. Last year, farmers in Pengdian Village, Fifth District, Shahe, Hebei, did not know how to cherish pond water, and used 70 dan of water more per mu of cotton for spot planting than other villages (other villages used 30 dan). Their original plan was to use one pond of water to spot plant 100 mu of cotton, but they ran out of water after spot planting 40 mu.

In order to improve the efficiency of spot planting, some areas have adopted the method of digging pits along the ridges, first injecting water into the pits, and then having children and the elderly use spoons to scoop water for spot planting. Last year, Wang Qundao, a public security officer, and farmers Wang Leopard and others in Xijiazhuang Village, Jin County, Hebei Province, tried this method and achieved good results. Using the method of carrying water for spot planting, eight of them (including one child) could only plant two mu per day. After adopting this method, they planted eight mu every day.

It is Necessary to Establish the Idea of "Man Will Conquer Nature" and Give Full Play to the Organized Strength

The experience of drought-resistant sowing in various parts of North China last spring proves that the primary problem in doing this work well is to overcome the masses' idea of "relying on heaven and waiting for rain" and give full play to the spirit of patriotism. Many farmers felt that drought-resistant sowing was too troublesome, emphasizing the difficulties in drought-resistant sowing, and wanting to wait for rain to sow. Last spring, village cadres in Dazhang, Liutuoying and other villages in Boye County, Hebei Province, had two plans for cotton planting: if it rained, they could complete the plan, and if it didn't rain, they could plant at most half of it. Last spring, farmers in Zhongliulin Village, Handan, also planned to "plant 16 qing if it rains, and plant 8 qing if it doesn't rain."

Many facts prove that to eliminate this ideological obstacle, in addition to using the principles of "three-tenths of a harvest with seedlings" and "solar terms wait for no one" to persuade and mobilize labor models, and having farmers with drought-resistant sowing experience give typical demonstrations to establish the idea of "man will conquer nature," it is more important to inspire farmers' patriotic and production-increasing thinking, so that the masses consciously regard drought-resistant spot planting as one of their concrete expressions of patriotism. Last year, drought-resistant sowing in many areas was launched under the impetus of this huge force. After accepting the task of drought-resistant spot planting, many party members and farmers in Yuanshi County, Hebei Province, said: Although drought-resistant sowing is arduous, it is far less arduous than the hardships of the volunteer army fighting in Korea. The volunteer army wins battles and earns merits; we make contributions by drought-resistant spot planting.

The experience of drought-resistant sowing last year proves that another key to doing this work well is to universally promote labor allocation and mutual assistance. Drought-resistant sowing is a very difficult task, especially carrying water for spot planting, which requires a lot of people, labor, and many difficulties. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among farmers and implement labor allocation and mutual assistance to adjust the shortage of manpower and materials. In the drought-resistant sowing in various places last year, all 224 households and 269 people in Xiaodongguan Village, Lingshou County, Hebei Province, voluntarily formed 25 drought-resistant spot planting groups. Starting from April 20th, male laborers carried water, pulled water, and pushed water, while women and children dug pits and sowed seeds, and spot planted 820 mu of cotton in five days. Before farmer Zhao Yin joined the labor allocation group, he was worried all day long because his own land was dry and he did not have enough manpower. After joining the labor allocation group, he quickly spot planted 17 mu of cotton. In Gaizu Village, Qi County, Pingyuan Province, 600 people were organized for drought-resistant spot planting, planting more than 100 mu per day.

In some areas, there were also cases last year where the failure of farmers to help each other hindered drought-resistant sowing. In Shibei Village, Xinxiang County, Pingyuan Province, because farmers did not organize mutual assistance, those with wells watered and planted calmly, while those without wells had to wait. In many villages in the Fifth District, Shahe County, Hebei Province, pit water was used for spot planting. Last spring, there was little drought and water, and farmers in each village were afraid that there would not be enough water, so they developed localist thinking. Villages with more water did not allow other villages to use their water, and they were unwilling to help other villages even if they did not have enough manpower in their own villages. As a result, the drought-resistant spot planting plans of these villages were not completed.

The experience of drought-resistant sowing last year proves that doing this work well must also be based on facts and oppose any form of formalism. Last year, in drought-resistant sowing, cadres in some areas simply pursued the numbers of drought-resistant sowing. Among the 888 mu of cotton sown by drought-resistant methods in Maotan Village, Yuanyang County, Pingyuan Province, only more than 150 mu were planted by seizing soil moisture and spot planting, and the rest were dry-drilled and broadcasted, and most of them did not emerge. The main reason for this phenomenon was that some village cadres lacked concrete leadership and adopted commandist methods, limiting the masses: "Complete it in five days, or you will be criticized!" After completing the task of drought-resistant sowing, cadres in Majiazhai Village, Nangong County, Hebei Province, believed that "everything was fine" and let go. After inspection by the work team of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, it was found that among the 900 mu of cotton spot planted by drought-resistant methods, 400 mu did not have full emergence.

Drought-resistant sowing is an arduous and complex task, and after sowing, it is easy to have uneven emergence. For example, last year, there were 400,000 mu of cotton fields in the Xingtai area of Hebei Province that did not have full emergence. In order to consolidate the effect of drought-resistant sowing, after drought-resistant sowing, the emergence should be checked at any time, and replanting and transplanting should be done in time, and then attention should be paid to protecting the seedlings, so as to completely overcome the drought and ensure a bumper harvest.

    华北地区一九五一年抗旱播种的经验
    本报综合稿
    春耕播种是农业生产过程中的一个主要环节。播种及时与否，和作物的产量有密切的关系。
    华北地区经常发生春旱，为了及时播种，防旱保墒、抗旱播种就成为华北地区农业生产中的一项重要工作。华北地区去年春旱严重，全区抗旱播种的棉田占全部播种面积的百分之七十。以各省来说，河北去年抗旱播种的棉田占全部播种面积百分之六十九；据平原省去年五月中旬的统计，播种六百八十万亩的棉花中，抗旱播种的约有六百万亩。山西省去年抗旱下种的作物有一千二百九十七万亩，占全省春播面积的百分之三十三强。
    也正由于华北地区时常春旱，若干地区的农民在春季抗旱斗争中积累了许多抗旱播种的经验。特别是去年，华北广大农民在爱国丰产运动中，把抗旱播种的方法又进一步地发展了。
    抢墒借墒和挑水点种是抗旱播种的两个主要方法
    抗旱播种方法的主要一项是抢墒、借墒。这个方法在去年抗旱种棉时是被广泛采用的。河北省去年棉田播种有半数以上是用的这个方法。
    抢墒、借墒是抓紧土壤含有一定水分的时机进行春播。抢墒、借墒播种方法最大的好处是效率大。去年河北磁县西固义村抗旱种棉八百亩，用抢墒、借墒办法播种，七天就完成了。平原省济源、孟县、沁阳等县农民趁墒抢种，都很快地完成了播种计划。
    根据去年华北若干地区抗旱播种的经验，在抢墒、借墒中，查验墒土，掌握墒情，抓紧时机，及时播种，是很重要的。去年河北武安县有些干部和农民在植棉开始时，由于缺乏经验，对抢种借墒没有足够重视，在墒土允许耩种的情况下单纯采用点种的办法，以致浪费了人力，使计划未能按时完成。原计划种棉四十五万亩，直到四月二十日才种上两万亩。河北磁县若干村庄的农民认为抢墒、借墒办法不保险，不愿采用，结果把好墒土耽误了。以林檀镇为例，这个镇原有三百亩地有好墒土可以播种，耽误了几天，后来只有七十亩地能抢墒播种。河北省曲周县去年在四月下旬超额完成了抗旱播种任务的原因之一，就是贯彻了“先抢墒，后点种”的方针，增强了抗旱播种的效率。
    许多农民在抢墒、借墒播种中，为了增加种子出苗所需要的水分，除了普遍的浸种以外，还把高粱秸、玉茭瓤等泡得饱含水分（一段秫秸能吸水一、二两），伴随种子播入土中。河北灵寿尹家凡同村的农民采用了这一方法，抗旱播种的三百亩棉田都出了苗。
    抢墒播种的先决条件是田里有好墒土。华北许多地区保墒的主要方法是秋季随耕随耙，春天提早耙地，并作到勤耙、细耙，使土壤里保持一定的水分，和减少水分的蒸发。耙地是在目前防旱抗旱运动中必须作好的一件事情。
    在抢墒、借墒之外另一抗旱播种办法就是挑水点种。在过于干旱和缺乏墒土的地区，可以采用这个办法。去年河北抗旱播种的棉花，约有四分之一是采用这一方法播种的。
    这个办法的缺点，是播种效率低，费工多。采用这个办法，必须充分发挥组织起来的力量，事先准备足够用的拉水、挑水、盛水的工具，和合理地组织人力。去年河北省武强县东堂旺等五十二个村，为了有组织有计划地抗旱点种，组织了五百五十六个互助组，挖了六十个土井，准备了三千二百九十个水桶和三十个大汽油桶。房山县大韩继村农民去年为了准备抗旱点种，早在四月上旬就把水桶、大车、牲畜组织成拉水队和驮水队。大名县全县农民在参加抗旱播种中，除了赶挖土井以外，还把所有能盛水、运水的用具——木杓、盆罐、洋铁桶、油篓、水缸、大车等都使用起来。做到人、牲畜、车、盛水用具“四不闲”。
    因为挑水点种需水很多，所以在点种时一定要力求发挥水的效用，在水源不足的地区还要注意节约用水。去年河北沙河五区彭?村的农民，因为不知道珍惜池水，点种一亩棉花比别村多用七十担水
    （别村用三十担）。他们原计划用一池水点种一百亩棉花，后来点种了四十亩就没有水了。
    为了提高点种效率，有的地区采取顺垅挖坑，先把水注入坑内，然后由小孩、老人用勺舀水点种的办法。去年河北省晋县西贾庄村公安员王群道和农民王洛豹等试用这一方法，成绩还好。他们八个人
    （其中有小孩一人）用挑水点种的办法，一天只能种二亩。在采用这一办法后，每天点种八亩。
    必须树立“人定胜天”的思想和发挥组织起来的力量
    华北各地去年春季抗旱播种的经验证明：做好这一工作的首要问题是克服群众的“靠天等雨”思想，发挥爱国主义精神。许多农民嫌抗旱播种太麻烦，强调抗旱播种中的困难，而要等雨下种。河北省博野县大西章、刘陀营等村的村干部在去年春天对植棉就有两个打算：下了雨就能完成计划，不下雨顶多能种一半。邯郸中柳林村的农民在去年春天也有“下雨种十六顷，不下雨种八顷”的打算。
    许多事实证明，要排除这种思想障碍，除了用“见苗三分收”“节气不等人”等道理说服和动员劳动模范，有抗旱播种经验的农民典型示范，确立“人定胜天”的思想以外，更重要的是启发农民的爱国丰产思想，使群众自觉地把抗旱点种做为自己爱国的具体表现之一。去年许多地区的抗旱播种都是在这一巨大力量推动下展开的。河北省元氏县有许多党员、农民在接受抗旱点种任务以后表示：抗旱播种虽然艰苦，但是比起志愿军在朝鲜打仗的艰苦可差的多了。志愿军打胜仗立功；我们抗旱点种立功。
    去年抗旱播种的经验证明，做好这一工作的另一关键是普遍提倡拨工互助。抗旱播种是一件很艰巨的工作，特别是挑水点种，需人费工，困难很多。因此，必须发扬农民的团结友爱精神，实行拨工互助，以调剂人力、物力的不足。在去年各地抗旱播种中，河北省灵寿县小东关全村二百二十四户、二百六十九个人自愿组成二十五个抗旱点种小组，从四月二十日开始，男劳力担水、拉水、推水，妇女、儿童刨坑、下种，在五天内点种了八百二十亩棉花。农民赵印没有参加拨工组以前，看到他自己的地干、人力不够整天发愁，自参加拨工组以后，很快点种了十七亩棉花。平原省淇县盖族村为抗旱点种组织起六百人，一天点种了一百多亩。
    有的地区在去年也曾发生因农民不能互助而妨碍了抗旱播种的事例。平原省新乡县石碑村的农民因为没有组织互助，有井的从容浇种，没井的只好等待。河北省沙河县五区很多村庄都用坑水点种。去春天旱水少，各村农民都怕水不够用，就产生了本位主义思想，水多的村庄的水不许别的村用，本村人力不够也不肯和别的村互助。结果，这些村庄的抗旱点种计划都没有完成。
    去年抗旱播种的经验证明、做好这一工作还必须实事求是，反对任何形式主义。去年在抗旱播种中，有的地区的干部单纯追逐抗旱播种的数字。平原省原阳县毛滩村抗旱播种的八百八十八亩棉花中，抢墒种的和点种的只有一百五十多亩，其余都是干耩撒种的，大部没有出苗。产生这一现象的主要原因，是某些村干部缺乏具体领导，并采取命令主义的办法，限定群众：“五天完成，不完成受批评！”河北省南宫县马家寨村干部在完成抗旱播种的任务以后，认为“万事大吉”放手不管。经中共邢台地委工作队检查，发现抗旱点种的九百亩棉田中，有四百亩出苗不全。
    抗旱播种是一件艰巨复杂的工作，播种以后，很容易出苗不齐。如去年河北省邢台专区没有出全苗的棉田就有四十万亩。为了巩固抗旱播种的效果，在抗旱播种以后应该随时检查出苗的情况，及时补种和移苗，然后还要注意保苗，这样才能彻底战胜干旱，保证丰产。
