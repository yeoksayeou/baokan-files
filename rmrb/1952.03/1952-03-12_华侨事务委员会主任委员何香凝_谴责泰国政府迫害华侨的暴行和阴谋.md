Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: The Luang Phibunsongkhram reactionary government of Thailand has been frantically persecuting our overseas Chinese in Thailand under various pretexts in recent years. On February 4th, the Thai Supreme Administrative Council passed another "decree" to further persecute Overseas Chinese, increasing the "Alien Identity Certificate Fee" from 20 baht (Thai currency) per person per year to 400 baht. Returned Overseas Chinese in Beijing are extremely indignant about this "decree" of the Thai government which persecutes and extorts Overseas Chinese. He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, issued the following statement on this matter:

The Thai government's recent decision to increase the "Alien Identity Certificate Fee" to as much as 400 baht per person per year is another barbaric measure to persecute Overseas Chinese.

More than 90 percent of the aliens in Thailand are our overseas Chinese. When this "Alien Identity Certificate Fee" increased from 4 baht to 20 baht after 1950, many Overseas Chinese were already struggling to bear the burden. Now this "fee" has suddenly increased twentyfold. If a family has five members, the whole family will have to pay as much as 2,000 baht a year, which is equivalent to making it impossible for the vast majority of Overseas Chinese in Thailand to live.

The purpose of this measure by the Thai government is not only to extort a large amount of money from our compatriots to finance its war preparations, but also to force Overseas Chinese who are unable to pay the "fee" to work as coolies, and even force them to serve as soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, so as to invade our territory under the command of US imperialism!

I want to warn the Thai government: this act of harming the survival of millions of Overseas Chinese and plotting to attack the People's Republic of China is intolerable to the Chinese people. The Thai government must immediately stop this atrocity and other measures to persecute Overseas Chinese. Otherwise, the Thai government shall be responsible for all consequences.

    谴责泰国政府迫害华侨的暴行和阴谋
    【新华社十一日讯】泰国銮披汶反动政府年来在各种藉口下，疯狂地迫害我国在泰侨民。二月四日，泰国最高行政会议又通过了一项进一步迫害华侨的“法令”，把“外侨随身证例费”从每人每年二十铢（泰国货币名）增加到四百铢。北京归国华侨对于泰国政府此项迫害与勒索华侨的“法令”，极为愤激。中央人民政府华侨事务委员会何香凝主任委员特就此事发表谈话如下：
    泰国政府最近决定增加“外侨随身证例费”至每人每年四百铢之多，这是它迫害华侨的又一蛮横的措施。
    在泰国的外侨，百分之九十以上为我国侨民。当这种“外侨随身证例费”由四铢递增到一九五零年以后的二十铢时，很多华侨已苦于负担，现在此种“例费”竟突增到二十倍，若一家五口，全家一年即需缴纳二千铢之钜，等于要使在泰绝大多数华侨无法生活。
    泰国政府的这种措施，其目的不仅在于勒索我侨胞的大批款项，以充其备战费用，而且是为了要强迫无力缴纳“例费”的侨胞充当苦工，甚至强迫他们充当蒋匪军队的士兵，以便在美帝国主义指挥下侵扰我国疆土！
    我要警告泰国政府：这种残害数百万华侨的生存，以及图谋进攻中华人民共和国的行为，是我国人民所不能容忍的。泰国政府必须立即停止这种暴行及其他迫害华侨的措施。否则一切后果应由泰国政府负责。
