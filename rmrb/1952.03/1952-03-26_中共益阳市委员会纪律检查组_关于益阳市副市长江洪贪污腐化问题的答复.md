Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor: The letter published in your newspaper on March 3rd, jointly submitted by the Communist Youth League branch of the Yiyang City Public Security Bureau in Hunan Province and Wu Chun, et al. (25 people), accusing Jiang Hong, Deputy Mayor of Yiyang City, of corruption and degeneracy, is essentially correct. Jiang Hong is currently studying at the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres. We have collected and sorted out the relevant materials and sent them to the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres for assistance in handling the matter.

    The CPC Yiyang Municipal Committee has also conducted a profound self-criticism regarding Jiang Hong's wrongdoings. This serves as a good lesson for the CPC Yiyang Municipal Committee. The reason Jiang Hong's problem arose is inseparable from the leadership of the entire CPC Yiyang Municipal Committee. In the past, the CPC Yiyang Municipal Committee adopted a seriously liberal attitude towards Jiang Hong's problems. More seriously, the Yiyang Municipal Committee even supported some of Jiang Hong's wrongdoings. This not only caused undue losses to state assets but also created immeasurable losses politically.

    In addition to further examining the influence of bourgeois ideology on us, we guarantee to eliminate all bad habits in the organs and establish new systems. Discipline Inspection Group of the CPC Yiyang Municipal Committee

### 中共益阳市委员会纪律检查组  关于益阳市副市长江洪贪污腐化问题的答复

    关于益阳市副市长江洪贪污腐化问题的答复
    编辑同志：三月三日你报刊载了青年团湖南省益阳市公安局支部委员会及吴纯等二十五人检举益阳市副市长江洪贪污腐化的来信，这封信基本上是正确的。江洪现在中央政法干部学校学习。我们已把有关材料收集整理起来，寄请中央政法干部学校协助处理。
    对江洪的错误行为，中共益阳市委员会也作了深刻的检查；这对中共益阳市委员会是一个很好的教育。江洪的问题所以能够发生，是和整个中共益阳市委员会的领导分不开的。过去，中共益阳市委员会对江洪的问题，采取了严重的自由主义态度。更严重的是，益阳市委员会还赞助了江洪某些错误行为。这样，不但使国家资财受到不应有的损失，并且在政治上也造成了无法估计的损失。
    我们除进一步检查资产阶级思想对我们的影响之外，并保证肃清机关中的一切坏习惯，订定新的制度。中共益阳市委员会纪律检查组
