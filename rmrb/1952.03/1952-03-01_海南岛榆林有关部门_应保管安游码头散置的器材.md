    Relevant Departments in Yulin, Hainan Island,
    Should Safeguard Scattered Equipment at Anyou Pier
    Comrade Editor: At the end of January, I went to Yulin, Hainan Island to inspect work and discovered that many valuable pieces of equipment at the Anyou Pier petroleum materials depot had rusted and deteriorated. This equipment includes oil pumps, engines, steel bars, steel plates, and a large number of screws, rivets, welding rods, etc. In addition, I also saw cement mixers, cranes, graders, etc. on the grass near the Anyou Pier and the Sanya Port water plant. According to local residents, these machines have been exposed to wind and rain on the grass for a long time, and some parts have rusted. I request that the relevant local departments pay attention to state property, be responsible for collecting this scattered equipment, and take care of it. Zhang Songhuo

    海南岛榆林有关部门
    应保管安游码头散置的器材
    编辑同志：一月底我到海南岛榆林检查工作，发现安游码头石油材料库很多宝贵器材已生锈腐坏了。这些器材包括油泵、发动机、钢筋、钢板以及大量的大小螺丝、铆钉、焊条等。另外，我在安游码头和三亚港自来水厂附近草地上，还看到有洋灰拌和机、起重机、平地机等。据当地居民反映：这些机器在草地上长期遭受风吹雨淋，其中有些机件已腐锈了。我要求当地有关部门重视国家财产，负责把这些散置的器材搜集起来，并加以保管。  张松火
