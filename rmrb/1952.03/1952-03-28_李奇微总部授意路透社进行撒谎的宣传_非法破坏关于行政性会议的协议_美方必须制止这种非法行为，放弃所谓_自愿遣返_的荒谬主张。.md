    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 27th: The U.S. side is illegally undermining the agreement on administrative meetings reached during the staff meetings of the fourth agenda item of the Korean armistice talks by privately disclosing information about the administrative meetings to Reuters reporters and instructing them to conduct one-sided, false propaganda, thereby disrupting the smooth progress of the armistice negotiations.

    According to the agreement on administrative meetings reached during the staff meetings of the fourth agenda item, the specific content discussed during the administrative meetings would be limited to the official knowledge of both sides and would not be released to the press. However, on the very first day the administrative meetings began (March 25th), the U.S. side violated the agreement by disclosing the specific content of that day's administrative meeting to a Reuters reporter. Under the instructions of Li Qiwei's headquarters, Reuters published it in a dispatch from Tokyo on March 25th under the name of so-called "authoritative sources here (Tokyo)," conducting one-sided propaganda.

    Nevertheless, it is not difficult to see from Li Qiwei's headquarters' one-sided propaganda that the "new" suggestion of the so-called "compromise solution" on the repatriation of prisoners of war put forward by the U.S. side at the administrative meeting is, in essence, still unreasonably insisting on its absurd claim of "voluntary repatriation." According to the U.S. side's "new" suggestion, even if our prisoners of war are "technically identified as North Koreans or Chinese," as long as they are forcibly labeled by the U.S. side as so-called "anti-communist prisoners," they cannot be repatriated. At the same time, outside the conference tent, a spokesman for Li Qiwei's headquarters in Tokyo was frantically barking in defense of the absurd "voluntary repatriation" principle, saying: "The United Nations Command will never sacrifice the anti-communist elements detained in the South Korean prisoner-of-war camps in order to break the deadlock in the armistice negotiations." The situation inside and outside the conference tent fully exposed the U.S. side's continued firm adherence to the so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle, which has been refuted by our side, and its vicious attempt to detain our captured personnel.

    This dispatch issued by Reuters under the instructions of Li Qiwei's headquarters also engaged in propaganda that distorted the facts, but it also inadvertently revealed the U.S. side's shameful motives for requesting the holding of administrative meetings. As everyone knows, holding administrative meetings was originally a request from the U.S. side. In order to facilitate the smooth resolution of existing issues in the fourth agenda item, our side accepted this suggestion from the U.S. side. However, in order to cover up its ulterior motives for requesting the holding of administrative meetings, the U.S. side did not hesitate to spread unfounded rumors for days before it formally made this request at the negotiating table, falsely claiming that our side first tentatively suggested holding administrative meetings to the U.S. side through progressive reporters. While Reuters repeated this lie, it had to admit that the so-called "tentative inquiry" by the Korean-Chinese side was entirely a rumor "arranged" by Li Qiwei's headquarters. Moreover, according to "well-evidenced news," "the United Nations Command was the first to propose a substantial news blackout on the discussion of the prisoner of war release issue." This news "proves the widespread view here (Tokyo) that the Allied negotiators are trying to extricate themselves from the extreme difficult situation they created last December." At the same time, Tokyo "authoritative sources" also had to admit:

    "The United Nations Command first proposed holding secret meetings (i.e., administrative meetings) to enable its negotiators to extricate themselves from the difficult situation in the prisoner of war release negotiations." The so-called "difficult situation" is nothing other than the fact that, under the powerful exposure of the Chinese and Korean people, the U.S. side's conspiracy to detain our captured personnel by using the principle of "voluntary repatriation" has been completely exposed and can no longer stand before the world. Therefore, Li Qiwei's headquarters vainly attempts to use the administrative meeting approach to continue to uphold its bankrupt "voluntary repatriation" conspiracy in a disguised form, in order to avoid the terrible condemnation of the people of the world. On this point, Reuters also had to admit: The "difficult nature" of the "compromise solution" "can fully explain why the Allied forces want to conduct secret negotiations before a practical agreement is reached."

    It must be pointed out that our side's acceptance of the U.S. side's request for holding administrative meetings was originally intended to allow staff from both sides to discuss the details informally at the meeting in order to seek a reasonable solution to the existing issues in the fourth agenda item. However, we will never allow the U.S. side to engage in any acts of sabotage and violation of the agreement in order to hinder the smooth resolution of existing problems, and we resolutely oppose the absurd principle of "voluntary repatriation" aimed at detaining our captured personnel. In order for the fourth agenda item to achieve a fair and reasonable agreement, the U.S. side must immediately stop releasing the specific content of administrative meetings or any other illegal acts that violate the agreement to the press, abandon this intolerable absurd claim of so-called "voluntary repatriation," otherwise the U.S. side must be responsible for all the consequences of undermining the agreement and delaying the negotiations.

### 李奇微总部授意路透社进行撒谎的宣传  非法破坏关于行政性会议的协议  美方必须制止这种非法行为，放弃所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张。

    李奇微总部授意路透社进行撒谎的宣传
    非法破坏关于行政性会议的协议
    美方必须制止这种非法行为，放弃所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张。
    【新华社开城二十七日电】美方非法破坏朝鲜停战会议谈判第四项议程参谋会议关于行政性的会议的协议，私自向路透社记者透露行政会议的情况，并指使其进行片面的、撒谎的宣传，破坏停战谈判的顺利进行。
    根据第四项议程参谋会议关于行政性的会议的协议，在行政会议期间，该会议讨论的具体内容将限于双方官方知悉，而不向新闻界发表。但是，就在行政会议开始举行的第一天（二十五日），美方竟违反协议，将当天行政会议的具体内容透露给英国通讯社路透社的记者。路透社在李奇微总部的授意下，即在该社东京二十五日电中，以所谓“此间（东京）权威人士”的名义，将其发表，进行片面的宣传。
    但是，尽管如此，人们还是不难从李奇微总部的片面宣传中看出：美方在行政会议上提出的关于遣返战俘的所谓“折衷解决办法”的“新”建议，实质上仍然是无理坚持其“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张。根据美方的“新”建议，我方战俘即使“在技术上确定为北朝鲜人或中国人”，但是只要被美方强制戴上所谓“反共分子的俘虏”的帽子，他们就不能被遣返。同时，在会议帐篷之外，东京李奇微总部的发言人也为坚持荒谬的“自愿遣返”原则狂吠说：“联合国军决不因为要打破停战谈判的僵局而牺牲拘在南朝鲜战俘营中的反共分子。”会议帐篷内外的情况，完全暴露了美方仍巩固地坚持已经被我方驳斥得体无完肤的所谓“自愿遣返”原则，一心想扣留我方被俘人员的恶毒阴谋。
    李奇微总部授意路透社发表的这一电讯，还进行了歪曲事实的宣传，但也不小心地泄露了美方要求举行行政会议的可耻动机。大家知道，举行行政会议原是美方的要求。我方为了使第四项议程中现存问题得以顺利解决，因此接受了美方这一建议。但是，美方为了掩盖其要求举行行政会议的不可告人的动机起见，不惜在它还没有在会议桌上正式提出这一要求之前，连日散布无稽的谣言，诬称我方首先通过进步记者向美方试探建议举行行政会议。路透社一面重复了这种谎言，一面却不得不承认：所谓朝中方面进行“试探”云云，完全是李奇微总部“布置好了的”谣言。并且，根据“有充分证据的消息”，“首先建议对释放战俘问题的讨论实行实质上的新闻封锁的是联合国军。”这个消息“证明了此间（东京）已经普遍抱有的看法，即联军谈判代表正力图摆脱他们在去年十二月所造成的极端困难的处境”。同时，东京“权威人士”也不得不承认：
    “联合国军首先倡议举行秘密会议（按即行政性的会议），以使它的谈判代表摆脱释放战俘问题谈判中的困难处境。”所谓“困难处境”不是其他，就是在中朝人民有力的揭露之下，美方企图利用“自愿遣返”的原则扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋已经原形毕露，在全世界面前再也站不住脚了。因此，李奇微总部妄想利用行政性的会议的方式，改头换面地来继续坚持其业已破产了的“自愿遣返”的阴谋，以避免遭到全世界人民的可怕的责难。关于这一点，路透社也不得不承认：“折衷解决办法”的“困难性质”，“可以充分地说明联军方面为什么要在实际协定达成前进行秘密谈判”。
    必须指出，我方所以接受美方关于举行行政性的会议的要求，原为双方参谋人员可以在会议上不拘形式地讨论细节，以寻求对第四项议程中现存问题的合理解决。但是，我们决不允许美方有任何破坏和违反协议的行为以阻碍现存问题得以顺利解决的阴谋，也坚决反对以扣留我方被俘人员为目的的“自愿遣返”的荒唐原则。为了使第四项议程能得到公平合理的协议，美方必须立即停止向新闻界发表行政会议具体内容或任何其他违反协议的非法行为，放弃这种决不能容忍的所谓“自愿遣返”的荒谬主张，否则美方必须对破坏协议和拖延谈判的一切后果负责。
