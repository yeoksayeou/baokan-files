Editor's Note: Shi Linghe, Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, is a Communist Party member with a long party history, but in his work, he seriously demonstrated the decadent and inferior bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology and work style. This newspaper criticized him in the "Brief Review of Cultural Life" column on February 2nd. After the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee Propaganda Department conducted several rounds of education and assistance for Shi Linghe, it issued a preliminary inspection report on Shi Linghe's errors on February 10th. This inspection report was approved by the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee and published in the Jiangxi Daily to educate the literary and art circles in Jiangxi Province. Now, we excerpt and publish this inspection report as follows:

Jiangxi's literary and artistic work has made certain achievements in the past two years, which is particularly evident in the mass literary and artistic movement of workers and peasants throughout the province. However, there are also serious shortcomings and errors, mainly manifested in the leadership of literary and artistic work. Shi Linghe (Communist Party member), Director of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, abandoned his responsibility for ideological leadership. Because his understanding of the ideology of the working class is extremely vague, he cannot treat literary and artistic work seriously based on the principles of the Party, and he did not see literary and artistic work as a serious weapon of class struggle and ideological work. Because he did not seriously study and learn Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, he showed great vacillation and blindness in their implementation. Furthermore, because he himself has a strong petty-bourgeois ideology and abandoned ideological transformation, he lived peacefully with bourgeois ideology and even feudal class ideology. Under his erroneous ideological leadership, the ideology of Jiangxi's literary and art circles presented confusion, the provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles lost its combat power, and the work of its affiliated associations was not carried out at all. The united front of literary and art circles has not been developed and consolidated as it should be, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism is very weak, sectarianism, disunity, the vulgar style of liberalism, and the petty-bourgeois ideological sentiments have grown in the literary and art circles, and even usurped the leadership position in some aspects, causing serious losses to the Party's literary and artistic work.

The CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee Propaganda Department, based on the instructions of the Provincial Committee, made a preliminary inspection of Shi Linghe's ideological leadership and work style in the work of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The preliminary inspection is described as follows:

I. Neglecting the leadership of the working class ideology in literary and artistic work, abandoning the ideological struggle

Shi Linghe, in his leadership of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, did not sufficiently recognize the complexity and sharpness of the current ideological struggle in literature and art. Therefore, he turned a blind eye to the growing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological tendencies in literary and art circles, and lacked correct understanding and analysis, abandoning political vigilance and class struggle on the ideological front of literature and art. He did not seriously and earnestly regard the practice of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies as a major and arduous task, and did not deeply understand that this is a continuous and serious ideological struggle process. Instead, he simply believed that a report on the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, and the creation of several songs, could determine the "direction" of literary and art workers and "establish" the view that literature and art should serve politics. He lacked a mass perspective, did not allow literary and artistic work to directly face the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and did not believe in the wisdom and strength of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He was long satisfied with the slogan of "using intellectuals as a bridge" and inappropriately emphasized "must go through the middle and primary school students of each county" to "promote the peasant literary and art movement," instead of relying on the peasants to develop their own literary and art movement. In "Jiangxi Literature and Art," he also particularly emphasized "giving appropriate consideration to general intellectuals." In this way, he abandoned the leadership of the self-reform work of intellectuals combining with workers and peasants, mistakenly placed the organization of literary and artistic activities in the student group, and mistakenly placed the target of literary and artistic publications on the intellectuals.

He proceeded from personal interests, isolatedly carried out drama reform, and neglected the leadership of new literature and art. The Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles mainly carried out two tasks in the past two years. In addition to running literary and artistic publications, it was also reforming old dramas. The provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles actually turned itself into a drama reform institution. Shi Linghe did not face the entire province and the workers and peasants with the entire literary and artistic work, but limited his eyes to the city, and not the working class of the city, but the audience of the petty-bourgeois class. He also had right-leaning thoughts in the drama reform policy, which promoted the idea of delaying the time and not wanting to reform. He did not rely on or assist the main force of the new literature and art - the Military Region Cultural Troupe and the Provincial Cultural Troupe, resulting in sectarianism and causing a considerable serious phenomenon of disunity.

In the united front of literature and art, he did not propose the necessity of strengthening ideological transformation and launching literary and artistic criticism, but engaged in unprincipled unity and isolatedly put forward the slogan of "bold creation." Under this erroneous ideological leadership, the ideology of Jiangxi's literary and art circles was very chaotic. For example, when Wu Shuochang of the creation group of the Provincial Cultural Troupe was conducting creation, he shut himself in a room, imitating a French writer, took off all his clothes, put a plate of snacks, a plate of candy, and a bowl of cold water on the table, and the table was piled with manuscript paper, holding candy in one hand, spitting smoke in his mouth, and the room was filled with smoke. It is said that he can only have unlimited "creative inspiration" in such a creative environment. What a ridiculous thing this is! But this was not resolutely criticized by the leaders of literary and artistic work. After the movie "The Life of Wu Xun" was shown in Nanchang, Wang Ying of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles wrote a review praising "The Life of Wu Xun" and sent it to Shi Linghe for modification. It contained words such as: "Affirmatively speaking, this film is rich in ideological, class, and artistic value..." etc., and was sent to Jiangxi Daily for publication. Later, after the People's Daily published editorials and articles requesting discussion and criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun," the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles only held one symposium. At the meeting, Shi Linghe admitted that most of the content of Wang Ying's article was his own argument. Wang Ying wrote a review of this article, and it was sent to him for revision, but he did not publicly make any review in writing. As the person in charge of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, he wrote an erroneous article praising "The Life of Wu Xun" himself, and did not conduct in-depth reviews or actively lead the literary and art circles to launch discussions. This is related to his consistent erroneous thinking and lack of self-criticism.

II. Separated from politics, separated from the masses, ideological content of many literary and artistic works went wrong

"Jiangxi Literature and Art" and "New Literature and Art" are both publications founded in June 1950. There is no significant division of labor between the two, and both were established, but neither was well-managed. In particular, "New Literature and Art," with Shi Linghe as the "issuer," often published "traces of important people." Where Shi Linghe went, news was published on it. This is completely the bad style of bourgeois flattery. This publication greatly praised Shi Linghe's own work - "The Seven Clever Matches," and published more than a dozen news items before and after. This cannot but make people feel that this publication was established to some extent for Shi Linghe's personal boasting. From the inspection of the three volumes and eighteen issues of "Jiangxi Literature and Art," although some good works were discovered, the ideology of this publication is not high, and the editorial department of the publication failed to regard it as ideological work. Therefore, it published a considerable number of literary and artistic works with poisonous and erroneous content. The Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles lacked ideological leadership over "Jiangxi Literature and Art," the work of the editorial department of "Jiangxi Literature and Art" was unsound, and the editorial board was just a formality. The direction and service objects of the publication were extremely unclear. The internal political atmosphere of the editorial department was thin, there were no plans, no inspections, and no strict review system was established. The publication had very poor contact with readers. They often regarded other people's correct criticisms of "Jiangxi Literature and Art" as "prejudice" and "deliberately finding fault" with the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, thus rejecting beneficial criticisms. As for soliciting opinions from worker and peasant readers, it has never been done.

The working attitude of the editorial staff of the publication is not serious. The publication has become a garden for their self-appreciation and self-expression, with few worker and peasant works, and even those are just window dressing. The editors regard the publication as a tool of a small group, talking about "friendship" and "face." One editor changed six pen names to publish works. The editors basically did not take on the task of revising manuscripts for correspondents, but spent a considerable amount of time rushing to create for royalties. How can they concentrate on running the publication well? And how can they avoid producing shoddy works?

Most of the theoretical articles published in "Jiangxi Literature and Art" are large-scale articles summarizing work, and there are very few short critical texts written about the current ideological problems in literary and art circles. Some articles have very wrong arguments. Wang Kelang, the editor of the publication, published an article "Learning and Using Folk Vocabulary" in the fifth issue of the second volume, saying that "language has class nature." After Jiangxi Daily criticized it, Wang Kelang did not accept it, but thought that this was "Jiangxi Daily has prejudice against the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles." Because Wang Kelang was one of the persons in charge of "Jiangxi Literature and Art," he used his authority without the opposition of other comrades in the editorial department, and continued to publish an article by Qi Gu in the first issue of the third volume to support and maintain his erroneous argument in order to resist newspaper criticism. Shi Linghe had read and agreed to publish these articles. It was not until the Beijing "Literary Gazette" published criticisms that Wang Kelang admitted his mistake and wrote a review.

Many of the creations published in "Jiangxi Literature and Art" do not show any characteristics of the times, or any development and changes in social and people's lives. In works reflecting the land reform struggle, there are many that have no class viewpoint, or the distinction between the enemy and us is unclear, and the position is lost. In works reflecting the suppression of counter-revolutionary movements, such as the dramas "Aunt Ding Figured It Out," "Suppression," and "Who Is the Enemy and Who Is the Friend," some portrayed the poor and lower-middle peasants who turned over as characters who "protected special agents," and some portrayed the initial ideological concerns or doubts of the masses when they did not understand the policies as thoughts and actions that "opposed" the people's government. In works reflecting the new atmosphere in the countryside after land reform, many praised the satisfaction of the small-scale peasant economy and rarely pointed out the path of patriotism, increased production, cooperation and mutual assistance for the peasants. The authors of the above works are almost all keen on the pursuit of bizarre stories, expressing their petty-bourgeois tastes. In terms of expression techniques, non-realistic techniques are used. Between the characters, concealing, cheating, and stealing are written so that one family does not believe in me, and I do not believe in you, like playing hide-and-seek. And mistakenly think that this is the so-called "dramatic," "dramatic conflict," and "life contradiction." In fact, this is a completely distorted way of writing real life. In rewriting historical stories and myths, the anti-historical viewpoint is expressed. In the three works "The Seven Clever Matches," "Chang'e," and "The Biography of Yue Fei" written by Shi Linghe, the anti-historical viewpoint is more obvious. These three works contain many petty-bourgeois thoughts and feudal superstitious thoughts. In "The Seven Clever Matches" (published in "Jiangxi Literature and Art"), clichés are used to fill in the lyrics, and mythical stories and realistic struggle life are rigidly "combined." The play is filled with descriptions of heaven, turning myths into superstitions for publicity. In "Chang'e" (published in "New Literature and Art"), the author's completely vulgar petty-bourgeois sentiment and love views are more fully revealed, with sentences such as: "Royal Garden, late at night, cool breeze messy hair, willow tip, autumn rustling, celestial sound," etc., which are unbearable to read. In "The Biography of Yue Fei" (published in "Jiangxi Literature and Art"), Yue Fei is written as a "natural nobleman" who is different from "mortals," and Yang Yao, the leader of the peasant uprising at that time, is written as a "lake bandit" who was "pacified," believing that this is also a manifestation of his "patriotism." This is a very wrong act of distorting historical facts.

III. Serious bureaucracy in work, vulgar and corrupt personal style, extremely serious extravagance and waste

Shi Linghe's bureaucracy in leading the work of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles is very serious, his personal style is vulgar and corrupt, and he strives for extravagance. Shi Linghe carried the burden of an "old party member" and was not interested in political study. He often used the excuse of "being busy with work" to not attend relevant work meetings convened by the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Committee Propaganda Department. He did not study the instructions and policy spirit of the higher authorities, and did work based on his interests. Many things were not reported before the event, and not reported after the event. The political atmosphere of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles was weak, democracy was not developed, and criticism and self-criticism were not carried out, resulting in the vulgarization of the Party's organizational life, and party members and cadres were not united with each other. After the counter-revolutionary Chen Wenlong was arrested, because Shi Linghe knew him in the past, he even asked Ji Fumin (Party member, former Secretary-General of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles) to write a letter to comfort or bail him out. Ji Fumin did not agree, and Shi Linghe criticized Ji Fumin as "not obeying the leadership of the organization." This is completely an act of losing one's position.

Not only that, but he also has a serious bourgeois vulgar and corrupt style. He called his three creations of "The Seven Clever Matches," "Chang'e," and "The Biography of Yue Fei" his trilogy. When summarizing the observation and performance of "The Seven Clever Matches," Shi Linghe blew his own horn. In the drama "Chang'e," the lyrics were in ancient Chinese, and the audience could not understand it at all. Because the content did not arouse the audience's interest, he put effort into arranging the lighting and scenery. Under his influence, the atmosphere of paying attention to scenery in Nanchang theaters became popular for a while. As for the scene of "The Biography of Yue Fei" was even more "grand," with a total of six acts and twenty scenes, resulting in it being impossible to perform. When commemorating the 15th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, he planned to perform a play in which Mr. Lu Xun came on stage and debated with Xu Maoyong and others, and wanted to use the change of lights to continuously show the terrifying scene of "people eating people," which was not performed after being criticized by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee Propaganda Department. On October 20, 1951, Shi Linghe held an 80th birthday celebration for his father. On the one hand, he issued an announcement, widely soliciting poems and articles for the birthday celebration, and on the other hand, he compiled and printed some old poems and lyrics written by his father from the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty to the liberation, and distributed them to people from all walks of life. This book is promoting the reactionary ideology of the feudal class. In addition to poems and lyrics about traveling in the mountains and rivers, enjoying flowers and playing with the moon, reviving the ancients and defending the Dao, and the joy of family reunion, it also praised Shi Linghe and his younger brother to the extreme. What is even more intolerable is that the poems once praised "Sino-US diplomatic relations," flattered American imperialism, and slandered the liberation war led by the Communist Party; and praised Kang Wenqing, a large landlord and bureaucratic capitalist in Ji'an as a "philanthropist." This move is by no means accidental. This is the inevitable result and specific manifestation of the development of Shi Linghe's corrupt ideological style and loss of position to the extreme. As for the love poems written by Shi Linghe in his improper love affair with a female comrade, there are even words such as "regardless of any danger, regardless of the storm and madness, in order to pursue the beautiful petrel, destroy all obstacles!" and "break through the darkness and evil forces," which show his complaints and stubborn resistance to organizational discipline.

In terms of work style, Shi Linghe strives for extravagance and sets up stalls everywhere. The money recovered by "Jiangxi Literature and Art" is nearly 100 million yuan, which has never been reported. There are many expenses that cannot be reimbursed and do not meet the expenditure system, which he approved and misappropriated. To this day, there is no clear account.

In addition, Shi Linghe showed a lack of organization and discipline in employing people, proceeding from personal feelings without going through organizational procedures, and even allowed some people with unclear political backgrounds, traitors, spies, and landlords and bullies to take the opportunity to infiltrate the organs of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, seriously losing revolutionary stand and political vigilance. According to statistics, there are as many as ten people who have been privately introduced by him in the past two years, and they have been assigned to work in the organs of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, farms, Gan Opera Troupe, local opera troupes, and the Provincial Literary and Art Cadre School, including Zhang Haoru, who had served as a pseudo-county magistrate and had blood debts, and has been arrested by our public security organs in accordance with the law.

In summary, it can be seen that the leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has been invaded and corroded by bourgeois ideology and has lost its combat power. Shi Linghe, as a Communist Party member and the main person in charge of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, not only did not wage a resolute struggle against this erroneous ideology, but instead lived peacefully with it for a long time. This is due to his petty-bourgeois inferior nature, the bad habits of the bourgeoisie that he has been infected with in the working environment of the White area for a long time, and the lack of rigorous transformation and training, and the result of not working hard in political study. After liberation, he did not pay attention to ideological transformation, but regarded himself as a "meritorious minister," and petty-bourgeois individual heroism and other ideas are still developing. His thinking is far behind the development of the situation. He lacks a thorough liquidation and criticism of his own non-proletarian ideological style, overestimates his own strength, does not study the Party's instructions, does not resolutely rely on the Party and the people, and rejects criticism and self-criticism, which is why he has such a result. Shi Linghe must deeply and thoroughly criticize and eliminate his own non-proletarian ideology and style.

    中共江西省委宣传部对江西省文联主任委员石凌鹤在领导思想和工作作风上所犯错误的初步检查
    编者按：江西省文学艺术界联合会主任委员石凌鹤，是一个党龄较长的共产党员，但在他的工作中严重地表现了腐朽的、恶劣的资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想作风。本报已于二月二日“文化生活简评”栏进行了批评。中共江西省委宣传部在对石凌鹤进行了几次教育帮助以后，并于二月十日对石凌鹤的错误作出了一个初步的检查报告，这个检查报告业经中共江西省委批准，并在江西日报上发表，以教育江西省文艺界。现将这个检查报告节录发表如下：
    江西省的文艺工作，二年多来是有一定成绩的，这特别表现在全省的工农群众文艺运动方面。但也存在着严重的缺点和错误，主要表现在文艺工作的领导方面。省文联主任石凌鹤（共产党员）放弃了思想领导的责任。由于他对工人阶级的思想认识极为模糊，因此他就不能根据党的原则，严肃地对待文艺工作，没有把文艺工作看成是严重的阶级斗争的武器和思想工作；由于他对毛主席的文艺方针不认真研究和学习，因此在执行中表现了极大的动摇性和盲目性；又由于他自己有浓厚的小资产阶级思想，并放弃了思想改造，因而和资产阶级思想甚至封建阶级思想和平共居。在他的这种错误思想领导下，致使江西文艺界的思想呈现混乱，省文联机构失去了战斗的力量，其所属各个协会的工作根本没有开展。文艺界的统一战线没有得到应有的发展和巩固，批评和自我批评的空气非常淡薄，闹宗派，不团结，自由主义的庸俗作风和小资产阶级的思想情绪在文艺界更形滋长，甚至在某些方面篡夺了领导地位，使党的文艺工作，遭受到严重损失。
    中共江西省委宣传部根据省委指示对石凌鹤在省文联工作上的思想领导和工作作风，作了一个初步检查，现将初步检查情况分述如下：
    一、忽视工人阶级思想对文艺工作的领导，放弃了思想斗争
    石凌鹤在文联领导工作上因对目前文艺思想斗争的复杂性和尖锐性认识不足，所以对文艺界在日益滋长着的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想倾向熟视无睹，更缺乏正确的理解和分析，放弃了政治警惕和文艺思想战线上的阶级斗争。他没有认真、严肃地看待实践毛主席的文艺方针这个重大而艰巨的任务，没有深刻理解这是一个不断的严重的思想斗争过程。而只简单地认为：一次全国文代会的传达报告，几首歌曲的创作，即可以断定文艺工作者的“方向确定”和文艺服从政治的观点“确立”了。他缺乏群众观念，不使文艺工作直接面向工农兵，不相信工农兵的智慧和力量，长期满足于“通过知识分子作桥梁”的口号，不恰当地强调“必须经过各县中小学生”来“推动农民文艺运动”，而不是依靠农民来发展农民自己的文艺运动。在“江西文艺”上，也特别强调“对一般知识分子予以适当照顾”。这样，就放弃了领导知识分子和工农相结合的自我改造工作，就把文艺活动的组织工作错误地放到学生群中，把文艺刊物的对象错放到知识分子的身上了。
    他从个人兴趣出发，孤立地进行戏剧改革，忽视对新文艺的领导。江西省文联二年来主要进行了两个工作，除了办文艺刊物外，就是改革旧剧。省文联在实际上把自己变成了一个戏剧改革的机构。石凌鹤不把整个文艺工作面向全省，面向工农，而把眼睛局限于城市，而且不是城市工人阶级，而是小市民层的观众。他在戏剧改革政策上，也存在着右倾思想，助长了拖延时间不愿改革的思想。对新文艺的主力队伍——军区文工团、省文工团，不依靠，不协助，产生了宗派主义，造成了相当严重的不团结现象。
    在文艺统一战线中，他不提出加强思想改造和展开文艺批评的必要性，却搞无原则的团结，并孤立提出“大胆创作”的口号。在这种错误思想领导下，江西文艺界的思想是非常混乱的，比如省文工团创作组吴硕昌在进行创作时，关起门来，模仿法国某作家，把衣裳脱得净光，桌上放着一盘点心，一盘糖果，一碗冷水，桌上乱堆着稿纸，一手拿糖果，嘴里喷着香烟，屋里烟雾迷漫。据说，他只有这样的创作环境，才会发生无限的“创作灵感”，这该是何等荒唐的事！而这却未受到文艺工作领导方面的坚决的批判。当电影“武训传”在南昌放映后，省文联王莹写了一篇歌颂“武训传”的观后感，送给石凌鹤修改，其中曾写有：“肯定的讲，这部片子是富有思想性、阶级性和艺术价值的……”等语，送江西日报发表。以后人民日报发表了要求讨论和批判“武训传”的社论和文章后，江西省文联只召开过一次座谈会，会上石凌鹤承认王莹写的文章的内容，大部分是自己的论点。王莹对此文写了一篇检讨，又是送他改的，他却未公开用文字作任何检讨。做为一个江西省文联的负责人，自己曾写了歌颂“武训传”的错误文章，不进行深刻的检讨，不积极领导文艺界展开讨论，这和他的一贯的错误思想，毫无自我批评精神是相联系的。
    二、脱离政治，脱离群众，许多文艺作品思想内容发生错误
    “江西文艺”和“新文艺”这两个刊物，都是在一九五○年六月创刊的。二者无显著分工，都办了，却都未办好，特别是以石凌鹤为“发行人”的“新文艺”上经常登有“要人行踪”，石凌鹤到那里去，都在上面发表消息，这完全是资产阶级的吹吹捧捧的恶劣作风。这个刊物对石凌鹤本人的作品——“七巧姻缘”，更是大加吹捧，单是新闻前后就发表了十多条。这不能不使人感到这个刊物在某种程度上是为了石凌鹤个人吹嘘而办的。“江西文艺”从它出版的三卷十八期的检查中，虽然发现了一些好的作品；但是这个刊物的思想性不高，刊物的编辑部未能把它看成是思想工作。因而发表了相当数量内容有毒素、有错误的文艺作品。江西省文联对“江西文艺”缺乏思想领导，“江西文艺”编辑部的工作不健全，编委会徒具虚名。刊物的方针和服务对象都极不明确。编辑部内部政治空气稀薄，无计划、无检查，未建立严格的审稿制度，刊物和读者联系很差。他们常把别人对“江西文艺”的正确批评当作是对江西省文联“抱成见”“有意找岔”，这样便拒绝了有益的批评。至于向工农读者征求意见，则更是从来没有。
    该刊编辑部人员的工作态度不严肃。刊物成了他们自我欣赏自我表现的园地，工农作品很少，即有也是点缀门面。编辑人员把刊物看成了是一个小集团的工具，讲“友情”，讲面子。一个编辑改换了六个笔名来发表作品。编辑人员对于给通讯员修改稿件的任务，基本上未担负起来，却把相当多的一部分时间匆匆忙忙地去为稿费从事创作。这样，怎么能够集中精力把刊物办好呢？又怎么能避免不产生粗制滥造的作品呢？
    “江西文艺”上所发表的理论性文章，多半是工作总结性的大块文章，很少针对当前文艺界思想问题来写短小批评的文字，有些文章论点非常错误。二卷五期刊登了该刊编辑王克浪“学习与运用民间语汇”一文，说什么“语言有阶级性”，经过江西日报批评，王克浪并不接受，反认为这是“江西日报与省文联有成见”，因王克浪是“江西文艺”负责人之一，便擅用职权，不顾编辑部其他同志的反对，继续又在三卷一期上发表了齐谷的一篇文章，来支持和维护他的错误论点，以图抗拒报纸批评。这些文章石凌鹤都是看过同意发表的。直到北京“文艺报”发表了批评文字之后，王克浪这才承认错误，写了检讨文字。
    “江西文艺”所发表的创作中，不少是看不出任何时代特征，看不到社会和人民生活的任何发展和变化的。在反映土地改革斗争的作品中，有不少是没有阶级观点，或敌我界限不分，丧失立场的。在反映镇压反革命运动的作品中，如“丁大妈想通了”“镇压”“谁是敌谁是友”等剧，有的把翻身后的贫雇农写成了“保护特务”的人物，有的把群众在不了解政策时，最初产生的思想顾虑或怀疑，写成了“对抗”人民政府的思想和行动。在反映土地改革后农村的新气象的作品中，有许多是歌颂小农经济生活的美满，很少给农民指出爱国增产合作互助的前进道路。上述等作品的作者差不多都热衷于离奇故事的追求，表现自己的小资产阶级的趣味。在表现手法上，沿用了非现实主义的手法。人物互相间，瞒、骗、偷，写得一家人你不信我，我不信你，如同捉迷藏一般。并错认为这就是所谓“戏剧性”“戏剧冲突”“生活矛盾”，实际上这是完全歪曲现实生活的写法。在改写历史故事和神话故事中，表现了反历史主义的观点。在石凌鹤带头写的“七巧姻缘”“嫦娥”“岳飞传”三部作品中，反历史主义的观点更为明显。这三部作品其中包含着许多小资产阶级思想和封建迷信思想。在“七巧姻缘”
    （发表于“江西文艺”）中，用陈词滥调来填写唱词，把神话故事和现实斗争生活生硬地“结合”起来，在该剧中大写天堂，把神话变成迷信来宣传。在“嫦娥”（发表于“新文艺”）中，更充分地流露了作者本人十足庸俗的小资产阶级情调及恋爱观点，满篇是：“御花园，夜深沉，凉风乱鬓，柳梢头，秋瑟瑟，天籁清音”等不堪入目的语句。在“岳飞传”（发表于“江西文艺”）中，把岳飞写成了“天生贵子”和“凡人”不同，并把当时农民起义的领袖杨么写成“湖寇”而“平”之，认为这也是他的“爱国主义”的表现，这是非常错误的歪曲历史事实的行为。
    三、工作上严重的官僚主义，个人作风庸俗腐败，铺张浪费十分严重
    石凌鹤在领导江西省文联工作上的官僚主义十分严重，个人作风庸俗腐败，力求铺张。石凌鹤背了一个“老党员”的包袱，对政治学习不感兴趣，他经常藉口“工作忙”而不出席中共江西省委宣传部召开的有关工作会议，对上级指示及政策精神，不研究，从兴趣出发做工作。很多工作事前不请示，事后不报告。省文联政治空气淡薄，民主未发扬，批评自我批评未展开，致使党的组织生活庸俗化，党员干部也互相不团结。反革命分子陈文龙被捕后，因石凌鹤过去认识他，竟要季夫民（党员，原江西省文联秘书处长）写信去慰问或保释，季夫民不答应，石凌鹤竟批评季夫民为“不服从组织领导”，这完全是丧失立场的行为。
    不仅如此，他还存在着严重的资产阶级的庸俗腐败作风。他把他的“七巧姻缘”“嫦娥”“岳飞传”三个创作，称为他的三部曲。在总结“七巧姻缘”观摩公演时，石凌鹤为自己大吹一顿。“嫦娥”一剧，唱词是用的古文，观众完全听不懂。因为内容引不起观众的兴趣，便从铺排灯光布景上下功夫。在他的影响下，南昌各剧院讲究布景的风气，一时兴盛起来。至于“岳飞传”的场面更是“宏大”，共六幕二十场，结果无法演出。纪念鲁迅先生逝世十五周年时，他计划演戏，戏中使鲁迅先生出台和徐懋庸等论战，并想利用灯光的变换，连续映出恐怖场面“人吃人”，经江西省委宣传部批评才未演出。一九五一年十月二十日，石凌鹤又为他的父亲作八十大寿。一方面发出启事，广征贺寿的诗文，一方面将他父亲从满清光绪年间直到解放后所写的一些旧诗词，汇印成册，分赠各界人士。此书是替封建阶级的反动思想作宣传的，其中除游山玩景、赏花弄月、复古卫道、天伦叙乐、互相唱和的诗词之外，还对石凌鹤及其弟弟极尽吹嘘之能事。更令人难以容忍的是诗中曾有歌颂“中美邦交”，并向美帝献媚，诽谤共产党所领导的解放战争；还有歌颂吉安一大地主兼官僚资本家“慈善人”康文卿的。这一举动，也绝不是偶然的，这是石凌鹤的腐败的思想作风，和丧失立场的行为，发展到顶点的必然结果和具体表现。至于石凌鹤在其和某女同志不正当的恋爱中所写的情诗，更有所谓“不顾任何危险，不顾雨暴风狂，为了追求美丽的海燕，冲毁一切阻挡！”及“冲破黑暗和恶势力”等语，表现了他对组织纪律的抱怨和顽抗情绪。
    石凌鹤在工作作风上，力求铺张，到处摆摊子。“江西文艺”所收回来的钱近一亿元，从未上报过，有许多报销不了和不合开支制度的费用，经他一批便挪用了，到今天也没有一个清账。
    此外，石凌鹤在用人上表现了无组织无纪律，不通过组织手续，从私人感情出发，甚至让一些政治面貌不清、汉奸、特务、地主恶霸都乘机混进了省文联的机关里来，严重地丧失了革命立场和政治警惕性。据统计，二年来经他个人私自介绍者先后有十人之多，分别安插到省文联机关、农场、赣剧团、地方剧团和省文艺干校等处工作，其中章浩如曾当过伪县长，因有血债，已被我公安机关依法逮捕。
    综观以上情况，可以看出江西省文联的领导上，已被资产阶级思想所侵袭和腐蚀，失去了战斗力量。石凌鹤身为共产党员，又是江西省文联主要负责人，不仅没有和这种错误思想作坚决斗争，相反地竟长期与之和平共居，这是由于他的小资产阶级的劣根性，长期在白区工作环境中沾染了资产阶级的恶劣习气，未经过严格改造锻炼，不努力政治学习的结果；而解放以后，又不重视思想改造，而是以“功臣”自居，小资产阶级个人英雄主义等思想仍在发展，他的思想远远落后于形势发展。他对自己的缺点和错误缺乏彻底的清算和批判，对自己的力量估计过高，不研究党的指示，不坚决倚靠党和人民群众，拒绝批评自我批评，才有这样的结果。石凌鹤必须深刻地彻底地对自己的非无产阶级的思想作风加以批判和清除。
