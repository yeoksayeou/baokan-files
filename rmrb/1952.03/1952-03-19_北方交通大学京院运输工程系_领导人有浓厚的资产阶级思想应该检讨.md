To the Editor:

The chairman of the Department of Transportation Engineering at Northern Jiaotong University's Beijing Institute, Lin Damei, and the vice-principal, Jin Shixuan, have strong bourgeois ideologies. These two monopolize departmental affairs, boast to each other, and vigorously disseminate bourgeois ideology to the students. They have publicly stated to all students on more than one occasion at large meetings: "What are you making a fuss about? Once you leave school, you will all be station masters, then section chiefs, then bureau chiefs. You are all future bureau chiefs, so why don't you study hard!" They said to the students in the specialized courses: "Your future jobs will also be good, only twenty catties of millet less than the students in the Transportation Engineering Department."

When these bourgeois ideas of personal fame and gain failed to stabilize the students' emotions, Jin Shixuan and Lin Damei played new tricks. Our department was originally called the Transportation Department, but Jin Shixuan and Lin Damei, taking advantage of the students' interest in learning engineering, used the pretext of studying advanced Soviet experience to perfunctorily add some engineering courses and changed the name of the Transportation Department to the Transportation Engineering Department. Recently, Lin Damei said at a self-criticism meeting: "The motivation and purpose of changing the Transportation Department to the Transportation Engineering Department was purely to stabilize the students' emotions and maintain my personal reputation and position." Under the leadership of Lin Damei and others, our department's curriculum is divorced from the needs of the field. A graduate from the class of 1951 returned to the school and cried bitterly, saying to everyone: "Now I have to tell you, the four years I spent studying in the Transportation Department of Jiaotong University were completely wasted. What we learned is not suitable for use in the field at all." Director Zhao of the Business Department said in his self-criticism: "I once advocated that the first-year students of the Transportation Engineering Department should not go to the field for internships, because if they go to internships, they will understand everything, and then there will be nothing to teach." The students were very distressed when they heard these words.

After the Transportation Department was changed to the Transportation Engineering Department, our courses became unsystematic. Now, we have learned a little bit of everything, but we will be useless in the future. The students who graduated last year could not do machine work, nor could they do telecommunications work, so they had to become ticket sellers. This is not to say that the work of a ticket seller is not worth doing, but it is not appropriate to waste the people's millet by studying at university for four years and only being able to do the work of a ticket seller. The people hope to cultivate us into cadres with both moral integrity and talent, good health, and communist awareness, but our school is educating us with bourgeois ideas and misleading us with textbooks that are divorced from reality. This is completely inconsistent with the people's demands. We hope that the school leaders will quickly and thoroughly abandon bourgeois ideology and reconsider the fundamental problems of our department.

### 北方交通大学京院运输工程系  领导人有浓厚的资产阶级思想应该检讨

    北方交通大学京院运输工程系
    领导人有浓厚的资产阶级思想应该检讨
    编辑同志：北方交通大学京院运输工程系系主任林达美和副校长金士宣有浓厚的资产阶级思想。他们两人独揽系务，互相吹嘘，并向学生大肆散布资产阶级思想。他们不只一次地在大会上公开向全体学生说：“你们闹什么情绪？你们一出学校，就都是站长，由站长而段长而局长。你们都是未来的局长，还不好好念书！”他们对专修科的同学说：“你们将来的工作也不错，只比运输工程系的同学少二十斤小米。”
    这些资产阶级的个人名利思想不能稳定同学们的情绪时，金士宣和林达美就又玩弄新花样了。我系本来名叫运输系，而金士宣和林达美利用学生喜欢学工程的兴趣，就以学习苏联先进经验为幌子，敷衍塞责地添设了一些工程科目，把运输系改名为运输工程系。最近林达美在检讨会上才说：“把运输系改为运输工程系的动机和目的，纯粹是为了安定同学们的情绪，保持我个人的名誉和地位。”在林达美等领导下，我系的课程是脱离现场需要的。有一位一九五一年度毕业的校友回校大哭一场，向大家说：“事到如今，不得不对你们说，我在交通大学运输系学习的四年时间，可说完全白费，我们学习的那一套，根本不适合现场用。”商务系赵主任在检讨中说：“我曾主张运输工程系一年级的同学不要到现场去实习，因为要是让他们去实习，他们都懂得了，以后就无法教了。”同学们听了这些话都非常痛心。
    运输系改运输工程系后，我们的功课都变得毫无系统。现在，我们什么都学了一点，但是将来是一无所长的。去年毕业的同学，因为机务工作干不了，电务工作也干不了，只好做售票员。这不是说售票员的工作不值得做，但是在大学里吃了人民四年的小米，而只能做售票员的工作，这样浪费人民的小米是不应该的。人民希望把我们培养成为德才兼备，体魄健全，具有共产主义觉悟的干部，但是我们学校却是以资产阶级的思想教育我们，以脱离实际的教材贻误我们。这是完全不符合人民要求的。希望我校领导方面赶快彻底抛弃资产阶级思想，重新考虑我系的根本问题。
