To all levels of Democratic Women's Federations and member organizations:

I. This year's commemoration of "March 8th" International Women's Day, in urban areas, should, according to the unified arrangements of the Central and local Discipline Inspection Committees regarding the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy and the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, further mobilize and organize women to actively participate in this movement. We should more widely and deeply expose and denounce the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the working class and the people of the whole country, and expose the unscrupulous capitalists' despicable behavior of using women as commodities, toys, and sugar-coated bullets, so that working women can recognize the ugly face of the bourgeoisie, thereby raising the class consciousness and fighting enthusiasm of working women, expanding the organization of working women, strengthening the fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy and the fight against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, resolutely repelling the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, and consolidating the leadership of the working class in all aspects.

All localities must pay special attention to and systematically do a good job in the work of female shop assistants, female staff members, and the family members of shop assistants and staff members, so that they can actively report or mobilize illegal capitalists and corrupt elements to confess their crimes, and summarize and promote experience at any time. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, any exposure of serious incidents violating the Marriage Law and other laws concerning equality between men and women and protecting the interests of women and children should be supervised and assisted by the Women's Federation and the local government to resolve and deal with them separately in a timely manner, and support and encouragement should be given to those who expose them. At the meeting to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day, various types of advanced women who actively struggle in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy and the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence should be commended.

II. In rural areas, according to the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on agricultural production in 1952, the decision on vigorously carrying out mass drought prevention and anti-drought movements, and the specific arrangements of the local people's governments, women should be actively mobilized to participate in various agricultural and sideline productions, and specific tasks such as drought prevention and anti-drought. At present, we must concentrate our efforts to do a good job in spring plowing in a timely manner. When mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production, women who have not yet been organized should be called upon to actively participate in various mutual aid groups and cooperatives; the existing organizations should be consolidated and developed. And, on the basis of mass voluntariness, carry out childcare mutual aid work to solve the practical difficulties of women participating in production, so as to enhance women's labor efficiency and strive to increase unit area yield. Before and after the commemoration of "March 8th" International Women's Day, in conjunction with the central work of the local area, the Marriage Law should be further widely publicized and its implementation should be thoroughly checked. Educate men and women to correctly understand and implement the Marriage Law, and the Women's Federation should supervise and assist the government in appropriately handling typical cases of interference with freedom of marriage and persecution of women. At the meeting to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day, labor models, advanced producers, examples of free marriage, harmonious families, and efforts to increase production and practice economy, as well as cadres who conscientiously organize women's production and faithfully implement the Marriage Law, should be appropriately commended and rewarded.

III. This year's method of commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day should be based on the specific conditions of various localities, and various commemorative meetings of large and small masses and activists should be held. In the process of commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day, publicity must be expanded. In addition to focusing on the above-mentioned tasks in items I and II, the content of the publicity should appropriately publicize the resolutions of the Sixth Executive Committee Meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation on the women's movement to defend peace and convene an international conference to protect children (see the February 28th People's Daily and the second issue of this year's New China Women's Monthly), so as to strengthen the unity of international women.

IV. In addition to mobilizing the masses of women to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day, the women's federations at all levels should thoroughly carry out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the organs of the women's federations, resolutely correct the right-leaning idea that the organs of the women's federations are not large and there is no problem of corruption and waste, thoroughly investigate all corruption problems, large and small, practically reform the bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses (especially the masses of working women) and divorced from reality, conscientiously improve the relationship between the women's federations and the masses of working women, and better serve the working women.
