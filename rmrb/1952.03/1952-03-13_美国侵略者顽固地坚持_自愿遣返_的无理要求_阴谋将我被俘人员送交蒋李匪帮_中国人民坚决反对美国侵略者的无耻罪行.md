Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 12th: Numerous materials publicly released by the enemy side prove that the reason why the American aggressors have repeatedly stubbornly insisted on their unreasonable demand for "voluntary repatriation" in the discussion of the fourth item on the Korean armistice negotiation agenda, which violates international conventions, is entirely because they are attempting to transfer our captured personnel to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs. In order to realize this conspiracy, American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang have transferred a large number of special agents from Taiwan to the prisoner-of-war camps established by the U.S. military in South Korea to serve as so-called "teachers." For example, an Associated Press dispatch on March 2nd said that there were 19 Chinese from Taiwan serving as "teachers" in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp. The American "Time" magazine published on January 28th also reported that "the intelligence unit of the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island has five Chinese Kuomintang members from Taiwan, and another 22 people (Chinese) are in charge of education classes." Other news reports said that the Chiang gang has sent 104 instructors to Korea to carry out "training" "work" for our captured personnel. Even the United Nations Command spokesman, Nokes, could not deny this point, but sophistically said: "They (referring to these 104 so-called 'instructors') were all recruited in the East, and undoubtedly some of them came from Taiwan."

The special agent instructors sent by the Chiang Kai-shek gang, in order to create conditions for detaining our captured personnel, in addition to carrying out many despicable and shameless activities, also committed three of the most cruel and shameless crimes: The first was to cruelly inflict on our captured personnel the method of tattooing their bodies with anti-escape and "defection" slogans, which the Chiang gang has used for many years (this method is still being practiced in the remnant Kuomintang troops on the islands along the southeastern coast of China). According to an Associated Press dispatch on January 20th, at least 3,000 of our captured volunteer soldiers had been forced to have anti-communist slogans tattooed on their bodies, the most common of which was the phrase "Oppose Communism and Resist Russia" (these four characters are also a hackneyed tune used by the Chiang gang for many years). The second was to force our captured personnel to sign "voluntary repatriation" requests in blood. According to the Associated Press, as of January 20th, 12,448 people had been forced to sign in blood. The special agents of the Chiang gang attempted to use this barbaric method to prevent these captured personnel from expressing their desire to return to their motherland and their hometowns because they had anti-reactionary slogans tattooed on their bodies and had written blood letters. The officers of the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camps openly threatened our prisoners of war, saying, "If they fall into the hands of the Communist army again, they will definitely only have a dead end." (Associated Press dispatch on January 20th) The third was to spread rumors that if our captured personnel were to be sent back to China, then these captured personnel would collectively commit suicide, go on hunger strike, and riot. This kind of rumor, which shows a guilty conscience, completely exposes the American aggressors' attempt to use the Chiang gang to further create incidents and obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. All fair-minded people around the world will see clearly that these conspiratorial activities of American imperialism are aimed at handing over our captured personnel to Chiang Kai-shek for persecution and massacre.

The U.S. negotiators have sophistically argued that the principle of "voluntary repatriation" is to "respect the individual's free will." But this low-level lie cannot cover up the bloody facts. On February 18th, our captured personnel in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp were immediately subjected to a well-prepared large-scale bloody massacre by American executioners (75 people died tragically and 139 people were injured) simply because they refused the U.S. military's unreasonable "interrogation" and "screening." Is this not enough to prove the truth of the so-called "respect for individual free will" in the mouths of the U.S. representatives? The "individual free will" shown by our captured personnel being forced to tattoo and write blood letters cannot only deceive anyone with a little common sense and sound nerves, but even FitzGerald, the military police captain of the number one prisoner-of-war camp of the American robbers who personally presided over this criminal activity, does not believe it himself. He said: "I have received many petitions, said to be written in blood, requesting that the signatories not be sent back," "At this time, I don't have much faith in the opinions they express." And another American robber, Morlan, who personally presided over this criminal activity, said even more bluntly: "You can only split their (our captured personnel's) heads open to know what they are thinking. How can you say what they really want?" Now the problem is very clear. The so-called "voluntary repatriation" of American imperialism is actually "forced detention." If you don't believe it, please look at the murderers' confessions! Lieutenant Colonel Levy, a spokesman for the United Nations Command, openly said on December 11th of last year: "The United Nations Command does not intend to give the Communist army a large amount of manpower and is unwilling to release the prisoners of war back." Then, on January 15th, the personnel of the Chiang gang's puppet embassy in South Korea said: "Once things are ready, the vast majority of Communist Chinese prisoners of war will be willing to return to Kuomintang China."

The Chinese people vow to fight to the death against the extremely vicious and shameless crimes of American imperialism in instigating the Chiang family gang to interfere in the repatriation of prisoners of war. The countless blood debts owed by the American aggressors and the Chiang family gang to the Chinese people will eventually be finally settled and receive the punishment they deserve.

    美国侵略者顽固地坚持“自愿遣返”的无理要求
    阴谋将我被俘人员送交蒋李匪帮
    中国人民坚决反对美国侵略者的无耻罪行
    【新华社开城十二日电】敌人方面公开发表的许多材料证明，美国侵略者在朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程讨论中之所以一再顽固地坚持其破坏国际公约的“自愿遣返”的无理要求，完全是由于他们企图将我方被俘人员转送给蒋介石和李承晚匪帮。美帝国主义与蒋介石匪帮为了实现这个阴谋计划，曾经从台湾抽调了大批特务分子到南朝鲜美军所设的俘虏营中充任所谓“教员”。如美联社三月二日的电讯说，巨济岛战俘营中有十九名自台湾来的中国人充任“教员”。一月二十八日出版的美国“时代”周刊也报道巨济岛的“俘虏营谍报组中有五个从台湾来的中国国民党人，另外有二十二个人（中国人）掌管教育班”。另外的新闻报道中说，蒋匪帮已派了一百零四名教官到朝鲜担任“训练”我方被俘人员的“工作”。这一点连联合国军发言人纳科斯也无法抵赖，但诡辩说：“他们（按指这一百零四名所谓‘教官’）都是在东方招募的，无疑地有些是从台湾来的”。
    蒋介石匪帮所派的特务教官为了给扣留我方被俘人员制造条件，除进行了许多卑鄙无耻的活动之外，还做了三件最残酷最无耻的罪恶勾当：第一件是把蒋匪帮使用了多年的为防止士兵逃跑和“叛变”而强迫在他们身上刺字的办法（这个办法目前在中国东南沿海岛屿上的国民党残匪军队中仍在实行着），残忍地行施于我方被俘人员的身上。据合众社一月二十日的电讯中透露，我志愿军被俘人员中，当时至少已有三千人被强迫在他们身上刺上了反共标语，其中最常见的是“反共抗俄”的字句（这四个字也是蒋匪帮使了多年的谰调）。第二件是强迫我方被俘人员用血在“自愿遣返”的请求书上签字，据合众社报道截止一月二十日即已有一万二千四百四十八名被强迫用血签了字，蒋匪帮的特务们妄图使用这种野蛮的办法，使这些被俘的我方人员因为身上刺有反动口号和写过血书，而不敢再表示他们要求回到祖国、回到他们家乡来的愿望。美军俘虏营的军官曾公开地威吓我方战俘说：“如果他们再落入共军手中，他们一定只有死路一条了。”（合众社一月二十日电）第三件是大造谣言说，假如要把我方被俘人员送回中国的话，那末这些被俘人员将集体自杀、绝食和暴乱。这种此地无银三百两的谣言，完全暴露了美国侵略者企图利用蒋匪帮来进一步制造事件，阻挠战俘遣返的阴谋。全世界公正人士都会看清，美帝国主义这些阴谋活动都是为了要将我方被俘人员交给蒋介石，供其进行迫害和屠杀。
    美方的谈判代表曾诡辩地说，“自愿遣返”的原则是为了“尊重个人的自由意志”。但低劣的谎言掩盖不了血淋淋的事实。二月十八日巨济岛俘虏营中的我方被俘人员仅仅因为拒绝了美军无理的“讯问”和“甄别”，就立刻遭到美国刽子手们准备周密的大规模的血腥屠杀（惨死者七十五人，受伤者一百三十九人）。这难道还不足以证明美方代表口中的所谓“尊重个人的自由意志”的真相吗？我方被俘人员被强迫刺字写血书所表现出来的“个人的自由意志”，不仅骗不了任何稍有常识和神经健全的人，而且就连亲自主持这种罪恶活动的美国强盗第一号俘虏营的军事警察队长费兹吉罗德自己都不相信。他说：“我已接到许多据说是用血写的请愿书，请求不要把签字者遣送回去”，“在这个时候，我并不太信赖他们所表示的意见”。而另一个亲自主持这种罪恶活动的美国强盗——摩兰就更露骨地说：“你只有把他们（我方被俘人员）的头劈开，才能知道他们是怎样想的。你怎能说出他们真正希望什么呢？”现在问题已很明显，美帝国主义的所谓“自愿遣返”，实际上就是“强迫扣留”。不信请看凶手们的自供吧！联合国军司令部发言人李维中校去年十二月十一日曾公开说：“联合国军不打算给共军以很大的人力，不愿把俘虏释放回去。”接着一月十五日蒋匪驻南朝鲜的伪使馆人员说：“一俟事情准备停当，绝大部分共产党中国战俘都愿意回到国民党中国境内。”
    中国人民誓死反对美帝国主义指使蒋家匪帮干涉遣返战俘的极端狠毒的无耻罪行。美国侵略者与蒋家匪帮对中国人民所欠下的累累血债，终必得到最后的清算和应得的惩罚。
