Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 25th: Experts and representatives of people's organizations participating in the Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Team on the Crimes of U.S. Imperialism in Germ Warfare," regarding the branch's investigation confirming that U.S. aircraft dropped germ bombs and scattered poisonous insects and substances in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, spoke to our reporter, unanimously denouncing the U.S. germ warfare criminals' attempt to destroy the Chinese people.

Peng Zemin, member of the investigation team and representative of the Red Cross Society of China, said:
    "Since our investigation team arrived in Liaodong, we have seen U.S. aircraft intruding into our airspace and scattering poisons almost every day. Our on-the-spot investigation has obtained a lot of evidence. All of this will forcefully shut the mouths of Acheson, Ridgway and other U.S. imperialists who are trying to quibble. I believe that as we successively publicize the various evidences of U.S. imperialism's germ warfare, it will surely further arouse the public anger of the people all over the world."

Fang Shishan, member of the team and Secretary-General of the Chinese Medical Association, said: "After personally seeing the germ bombs dropped and the various poisonous substances and insects released by U.S. imperialism, we are extremely indignant at the crimes of U.S. imperialists in using bacteriological weapons in the Northeast. At the same time, we saw on the front lines of national defense that the people of Liaodong have united to become a team to eliminate bacteria, fully demonstrating that the power of the masses is unlimited and invincible."

Mei Ru'ao, member of the team and international jurist, said: "In our week-long on-the-spot investigation, we obtained a lot of physical and testimonial evidence, all proving that U.S. imperialists had scattered bacteria-carrying insects in various parts of Northeast China, especially along the Yalu River. The remains of the germ bomb found outside the East Gate of Kuandian and the accounts of those who witnessed it at the time more directly and powerfully prove that U.S. imperialists have indeed committed this heinous crime. From a legal point of view, this is the most valuable evidence, and U.S. imperialists cannot deny it. Everyone knows that the investigation of germ warfare is not an easy task, because the American aggressors themselves also know that germ warfare is a serious crime that violates international law and humanitarianism, so the methods it has taken to carry out germ warfare against our people are extremely cunning and extremely secretive. But after these days of hard work, we have now mastered sufficient, reliable materials to reveal that U.S. imperialists have indeed continuously done and are still doing this shameless and bloody deed. I believe that after these materials are published, honest people all over the world will feel infinite indignation and unite to condemn it, and those American germ warfare criminals who kill without bloodshed will never escape the most severe justice of the people of the world."

Zhou Jianren, member of the team and biologist, said: "The germ bomb containing poisonous insects and other objects that we found in Kuandian County adds another powerful piece of evidence on top of many powerful pieces of evidence. Although U.S. imperialists are known for their sophistry, facts speak louder than words. I believe that they will be judged by the people of the world."

Liu Chongle, member of the team and entomologist, said: "The bacteria-carrying poisonous insects we saw once again exposed the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism to the people of the world. I hope that entomology researchers across the country will be mobilized urgently. We will surely achieve victory on the anti-germ warfare front, just like in the treatment of the Huai River and the elimination of locusts."

Xie Shaowen, member of the team and bacteriologist, said: "Hearing the personal accounts of the working people and seeing the actual objects scattered by U.S. aircraft have given us sufficient facts to prove that U.S. imperialism has already started germ warfare and is still carrying it out. We bacteriologists will make further efforts to repel the germ warfare waged by U.S. imperialism."

Cheng Shaoqing, member of the team and veterinarian, said: "We scientists have full confidence that we can study any secret bacteria and viruses released by U.S. imperialism. At present, we have already made considerable gains and are continuing to expand these achievements."

Shen Qiyi, member of the team and botanist, said: "The large amount of testimonial and physical evidence obtained in just a few days has proven beyond any doubt that U.S. imperialists are carrying out inhumane germ warfare on our land. During our stay in Andong, U.S. aircraft scattered leaves and feathers containing toxins in Andong City. In addition to feeling extremely hatred for the brutal and shameless American germ warfare criminals, we natural science workers have a greater responsibility to participate in this just and glorious anti-germ warfare battle."

Wu Maosun, member of the team and Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, who attended the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, said: "Coming to Andong and Kuandian for only a few days, we see enemy planes intruding into our airspace every day, and we personally saw the masses capture a large number of poisonous insects. The fragments of the germ bomb found in Kuandian are an undeniable proof of U.S. imperialism's germ warfare. The Second World Peace Congress held in Warsaw once announced the definition of aggression, and also demanded an unconditional ban on all kinds of atomic and bacteriological weapons, and demanded that the first country to use these weapons must be declared a war criminal. U.S. imperialism ignores the just demands of the people of the world and dares to be the enemy of the people of the world. It has undoubtedly committed the crime of aggression and the crime against humanity. We demand that the World Peace Council immediately take effective measures based on the resolutions of the Warsaw Congress to stop the bloody crimes of U.S. imperialism."

Liao Gailong, member of the team and representative of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, said: "The discovery of the germ bomb carcass and other evidence in the eastern suburbs of Kuandian County once again irrefutably proves the crime of the American aggressors in carrying out inhumane germ warfare against the Chinese people, and proves that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of human justice, civilization, and the cause of world peace. We, the entire Chinese people and the people of the world, who bear the great responsibility of defending human civilization and the cause of international peace, should absolutely not tolerate the American aggressors continuing to carry out this bloody atrocity."

Tian Demin, member of the team and Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, said: "The germ bomb dropped by U.S. military aircraft in Kuandian County is one of the proofs of U.S. imperialism's germ warfare and is a fact that Truman and Acheson cannot deny. On behalf of the youth and students of the whole country, I lodge a serious protest against this heinous crime of U.S. imperialism, and at the same time call on the youth of the world who love peace and uphold justice to quickly form a common anti-germ warfare front to stop the inhumane germ warfare carried out by U.S. imperialism."

Wang Runfeng, member of the team and representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: "U.S. imperialism flagrantly violates human justice, violates international law, and scatters poisonous insects and other toxic substances carrying germs in our airspace, which has aroused the incomparable indignation of workers and peace-loving and just people across the country, Asia, and the world. The Chinese working class will support the Chinese and Korean People's Army with practical actions of active production and strict economy, and severely strike the U.S. imperialists who launched germ warfare."

Zhu Xi, epidemiologist researcher at Peking University Medical College, said: "After I joined the work of the investigation team in Liaodong, I personally saw that in a county, a large number of poisonous insects were found in areas where U.S. aircraft intruded, and on the snow. In other areas, there were no poisonous insects at all. The weather here is very cold, and it was still snowing yesterday. The scum of the American scientific community have lost their conscience and turned the results of human labor—scientific research—into a tool for imperialists to slaughter mankind. We must strive to try this group of germ warfare criminals fed by Wall Street bosses and stained with the blood of the people as soon as possible."

Sun Xipu, professor of the School of Public Health of the China Medical University, who participated in the work of the team, said: "The discovery of the American germ bomb imitating the 'Ishii bomb' is a relentless exposure of the sophistry and denial of U.S. imperialists."

Hu Xiangbi, technical director of the Veterinary Research Institute of the Department of Agriculture of the Northeast People's Government, said: "The testimonial and physical evidence obtained by the investigation team is so specific and reliable that U.S. imperialism has no room for denial and sophistry."

Cao Ming, vice chairman of the Northeast Literary and Art Workers Association and female writer, said: "If anyone still doubts whether U.S. imperialists are conducting germ warfare in the Northeast region of China, then please go to Kuandian to see the germ bomb dropped by U.S. aircraft! The broad masses of the Chinese people have risen to accuse this crime and make a request to the people of the world: The war criminals who used the germ bomb first must be held accountable!"

Ma Shijun, entomology expert, said: "I saw the germ bomb dropped by U.S. imperialism in Kuandian County and went to many places where poisonous insects were found, confirming the crime of U.S. imperialism in violating international law. Although Acheson is still quibbling, he cannot cover up the existing facts and the eyes of scientific workers. I once personally saw the evidence of the U.S. government's long-term and large-scale preparation for germ warfare. A year and a half ago, when I was in the United States, I personally saw photos of U.S. imperialism using living people for germ weapon experiments. I also talked face-to-face with Dr. Mike Cove, an employee of the U.S. Public Health Department. He said: 'The only effective way to deal with a populous enemy is to use biological products - bacteria. Japan used it in the past, and international wars will still consider using it in the future.' Today's facts fully prove that U.S. imperialism has been planning germ warfare against the Chinese people for a long time."

Guo Shutian, entomology worker, said: "The fragments of the germ bomb after the explosion, the bomb craters, and the large number of poisonous insects scattered around that we saw once again confirmed that U.S. imperialism has committed an unspeakable heinous crime." Photojournalist Wang Chunde said: "I have taken all the photos of the germ bomb carcass and witnesses dropped by U.S. imperialists, and recorded the heinous crimes of American germ warfare criminals. American germ warfare criminals must not escape the just punishment of the people of China and the world." Guard Wang Shanlin said: "After I followed the investigation team to the scene and saw the germ bomb dropped by U.S. aircraft, I felt unspeakable hatred for the atrocities of U.S. imperialism in carrying out germ warfare. I hope that the people of the whole country will unite to defeat the germ warfare of U.S. imperialism."

    调查团东北分团中的专家和人民团体代表
    痛斥美国在东北进行细菌战罪行
    美国细菌战犯决不能逃脱全世界正义制裁
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】参加“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团的专家和各人民团体代表，就该分团查明美国飞机在辽东省宽甸县投下细菌弹和撒布毒虫、毒物一事，向本社记者发表谈话，一致痛斥美国细菌战犯妄图毁灭中国人民的罪行。
    调查团团员、中国红十字会总会代表彭泽民说：
    “自从我们调查团到辽东以后，几乎每天都看到美国飞机侵入我国领空并撒布毒物，我们的实地调查，已获得很多证据。这一切将有力地堵住美帝国主义者艾奇逊、李奇微之流的强词抵赖的嘴，我相信我们把美帝国主义进行细菌战的各种罪证陆续公布出来，必将更加激起全世界人民的公愤。”
    团员、中华医学会总会总干事方石珊说：“我们亲眼见到美帝国主义投下的细菌弹和撒放的各种毒物、毒虫后，对美帝国主义者在东北使用细菌武器的罪行万分愤慨。同时，我们在国防前线看到辽东人民已团结成为扑灭细菌的队伍，充分地表现了群众的力量是无限度的、不可战胜的。”
    团员、国际法学家梅汝璈说：“在我们所进行的一星期的实地调查中，我们得到了许多人证物证，都证明美帝国主义者在我东北各地特别是沿鸭绿江一带撒布了带细菌的昆虫。这次在宽甸东门外所发现的细菌弹骸体和当时亲眼目睹者所口述的情形，更直接地有力地证明了美帝国主义者确实犯下了这种滔天罪行。从法律观点来看，这是一个最有价值的证据，美帝国主义者是无法抵赖的。大家都知道：细菌战的调查工作原不是一件容易事情，因为美国侵略者自己也知道细菌战是违反国际公法和人道主义的严重罪行，所以它对我国人民进行细菌战所采取的方法是极端狡黠、极端隐蔽的。但是经过这些天的辛勤工作，我们现在已经掌握了充分的确实可靠的材料，足以揭露美帝国主义者确曾继续不断地干过而且现在仍在干着这种无耻的血腥勾当。我相信：这些材料公布之后，全世界正直人士必会感觉无限愤慨、一致起来予以声讨，而那班杀人不见血的美国细菌战犯们也决不能逃避全世界人民最严厉的正义的制裁。”
    团员、生物学家周建人说：“我们在宽甸县发现美帝国主义者装置毒虫等物的细菌弹，这在许多有力的证据之上，又增加一种有力的证据。美帝国主义者虽以善于狡辩著称于世，但事实胜于雄辩，我相信它必将在全世界人民面前受到裁判。”
    团员、昆虫学家刘崇乐说：“我们所看到的带细菌毒虫，使美帝国主义穷凶极恶的罪行，再一次地暴露在全世界人民的面前。我希望全国的昆虫研究工作者紧急动员起来，我们一定会像治淮、灭蝗一样，在反细菌战的战线上取得胜利。”
    团员、细菌学家谢少文说：“我们听到劳动人民的亲口叙述和看到美国飞机撒下的实物，使我们掌握了充分的事实，证明美帝国主义已经开始了细菌战，并且还在进行中。我们细菌学工作者将作进一步的努力，打退美帝国主义进行的细菌战。”
    团员、兽医学家程绍?说：“我们科学家有万分信心，美帝国主义撒放的任何秘密的细菌病毒，我们都能研究出来。目前我们已有了相当的收获，并在继续不断地扩大这些成绩。”
    团员、植物学家沈其益说：“在短短几天内所获得的大量人证物证，已经分毫不容置疑地证明了美帝国主义者已在我们国土上进行着灭绝人性的细菌战。就在我们逗留安东的期间内，美国飞机在安东市撒布了含有毒素的树叶和羽毛。对于残暴无耻的美国细菌战犯，除了感到万分愤恨之外，我们自然科学工作者，更有责任参与这一正义的光荣的反细菌战的战斗。”
    团员、曾出席华沙第二届世界和平大会的中国人民外交学会秘书长吴茂荪说：“来到安东、宽甸短短几天，每天都看到敌机侵入我国领空，我们亲眼看见群众捕捉的大批毒虫。在宽甸发现的细菌弹破片更是美帝国主义进行细菌战无可抵赖的罪证。在华沙召开的世界和平大会第二届会议曾经宣布关于侵略的定义，也曾要求无条件禁止一切种类的原子武器和细菌武器，并要求第一个使用这些武器的国家必须被宣布为战争罪犯。美帝国主义不顾世界人民的正义要求，竟敢与世界人民为敌，毫无疑问地犯了侵略罪与反人道罪，我们要求世界和平理事会根据华沙大会的决议立即采取有效的措施来制止美帝国主义的血腥罪行。”
    团员、中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会代表廖盖隆说：“宽甸县城东郊细菌弹骸体及其他证物的发现，又一次地不可辩驳地证明了美国侵略者向中国人民进行灭绝人性的细菌战的罪行，证明了美帝国主义是人类正义、文明和世界和平事业的死敌。担负着捍卫人类文明和国际和平事业的伟大责任的我们全中国人民和全世界人民，都绝对不应该容忍美国侵略者继续进行这种血腥暴行。”
    团员、中华全国学生联合会主席田德民说：“美国军用飞机在宽甸县投下来的细菌弹，是美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪证之一，是杜鲁门、艾奇逊所不能抵赖的事实，我代表全国青年学生，对美帝国主义这种滔天罪行提出严重的抗议，同时向全世界爱好和平主持正义的青年们呼吁，迅速结成共同的反细菌战的战线，制止绝灭人性的美帝国主义进行的细菌战争。”
    团员、中华全国总工会代表王润丰说：“美帝国主义悍然侵犯人类的正义，违犯国际公法，在我国领空撒布带有病菌的昆虫等毒物，已激起全国、全亚洲、全世界工人和爱好和平正义人们的无比愤恨。我国工人阶级将以积极生产、厉行节约的实际行动，支援中朝人民军队，痛击发动细菌战的美帝国主义者。”
    北大医学院流行病学研究者朱?说：“我参加调查团的工作到辽东后，亲眼看到在一个县内凡美机侵入的地区都发现了大量毒虫，而且是在雪面上。另外一些地区就完全没有毒虫。这里天气很冷，昨天还在下雪。美国科学界的败类丧尽天良地把人类劳动的结晶——科学研究的结果变为帝国主义者屠杀人类的工具，我们要争取更快地审判在华尔街老板豢养下的这一批手上涂满了人民鲜血的细菌战犯。”
    参加该团工作的中国医科大学公共卫生学院教授孙锡璞说：“模仿‘石井炸弹’的美国细菌弹的被发现，是对美帝国主义者的诡辩和狡赖的无情的揭露。”
    东北人民政府农业部兽医研究所技术主任胡祥璧说：“调查团所得的人证物证是这样的具体和确实，使美帝国主义再无抵赖狡辩的余地。”
    东北文艺工作者协会副主席、女作家草明说：“如果还有人怀疑美帝国主义者是否在中国东北地区进行细菌战，那么，就请他到宽甸去看看美机投下来的细菌弹吧！广大的中国人民已起来控诉这一罪行，并向全世界人民提出要求：必须追究第一个使用细菌弹的战犯！”
    昆虫学专家马世骏说：“我看见美帝国主义在宽甸县所投下来的细菌弹和到了许多发现毒虫的场所，证实了美帝国主义违背国际公法的罪行。尽管艾奇逊还在狡赖，可是他无法掩盖已有的事实和科学工作者的眼睛。我曾经亲眼看见美国政府长期、大规模准备细菌战的罪证。一年半以前，当我在美国的时候，我曾经亲眼看到美帝国主义用活人作细菌武器试验的照片，我也曾面对面地和一个美国公共卫生部职员迈克夫博士谈过话，他说：‘对付人口众多的敌手，唯一的有效方法是利用生物制品——细菌，过去日本采用过，今后国际战争仍考虑再用。’今天的事实充分证明了美帝国主义对中国人民进行细菌战是蓄谋已久的。”
    昆虫学工作者郭书田说：“我们看到的细菌弹爆炸后的弹片、弹坑和撒布在周围的大量毒虫，再一次证实了美帝国主义犯了不可告人的滔天大罪。”摄影记者王纯德说：“我已经将美帝国主义者投下的细菌弹骸体和证人，全部拍摄成照片，纪录了美国细菌战犯的滔天罪行，美国细菌战犯决不能逃避全中国全世界人民的正义惩罚。”警卫员王善林说：“我随从调查团人员到现场看到美国飞机投下的细菌弹后，对于美帝国主义进行细菌战的暴行，感到说不出的仇恨。我希望全国人民团结起来，击败美帝国主义的细菌战。”
