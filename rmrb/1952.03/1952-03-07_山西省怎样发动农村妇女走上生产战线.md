Shanxi Province's broad rural women, after a year of patriotic ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the universal implementation of the Marriage Law, have experienced unprecedentedly improved political consciousness. With high patriotic enthusiasm, they joined the patriotic agricultural production movement of 1951 alongside men, making significant achievements.

**Women and Men Possess Equally Infinite Wisdom and Unlimited Productive Capacity**

Women's participation in production in old liberated areas accounts for about 90% of the female labor force (excluding pregnant, postpartum, sick, and elderly women), while in new liberated areas, it averages 50%. In counties with a good work foundation in the old liberated areas, those organized for production have reached about 60% of the total female labor force, and in general counties, it has reached about 15%; in new liberated areas with a relatively good work foundation, the average has reached about 10%. Besides cutting grass, feeding livestock, carrying water, and delivering meals, they generally directly participate in major labor such as spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvesting. For example, in manure accumulation, according to a survey of 198 villages in seven counties including Wuxiang and Linxian, 3,336 women participated, accumulating nearly 90,000 loads of various fertilizers, averaging 26 loads per person. In wheat weeding, according to a survey of 49 villages in eleven counties including Zhaocheng, 2,400 women participated, weeding an average of four mu per person. According to a survey of ten districts and 965 villages in 35 counties including Yangcheng and Qinyuan, over 125,000 women participated in summer weeding, weeding over 540,000 mu of seedlings, averaging more than four mu per person. In cotton-producing areas, with over three million mu of cotton fields across the province, women's labor input accounts for about half of the total labor required in the entire series of production processes from cultivation to harvesting. Besides participating in general field labor, many women actively participated in the province's agricultural technology improvement movement, such as building water conservancy projects, improving soil, promoting new-style farm tools, soaking and mixing seed selection, removing diseased plants, and killing pests. A few advanced women, such as the mutual aid groups of labor models Shi Niudi, Yan Xiangguo, and Wang Cuifang, collectively purchased new-style walking plows, corn threshers, sprayers, etc., experimenting and demonstrating to the masses. Labor model Zhen Xiuzhu, in order to promote superior varieties, trial-operated a "small farm," promoting 80% of the farmers in the village to plant superior varieties. Advanced women in Songmugou Village, Kelan County, put forward the slogan "Technology Delivered to Your Door," personally conducting germination experiments and promoting them door-to-door; Li Gaizhi, Chen Junying, and others personally helped the masses with warm water seed soaking. In the campaign to eliminate cotton aphids, women labor models Liu Yueying, Shen Shunjin, Wang Lahua, and others first used sprayers, "666," and cotton aphid soap to eliminate cotton aphids, and invited farmers from surrounding villages to visit, increasing the masses' confidence in aphid eradication. According to statistics from over 300 villages in 22 counties including Changzhi, Taigu, and Linfen, over 30,000 women participated in summer seed selection, selecting 17,119 shi of superior wheat seeds. According to statistics from eight districts and 356 villages in 17 counties including Yuci, 34,800 women participated in eliminating cotton aphids, eliminating cotton aphids on 100,345 mu of land, ensuring a bumper cotton harvest. In order to reduce pest damage in 1952, women in 198 villages in seven counties including Shenchi and Xiyang burned 1,735 mu of grain stubble last year. According to a survey of 23 villages in Yushe County, there are already 155 women's mutual aid groups, with 1,084 participants. In the past year, in addition to accumulating 15,000 loads of fertilizer, delivering 8,600 loads of manure, cultivating 530 mu of soil lumps, filling 90 pits, and weeding 4,200 mu of wheat, they exchanged varieties for 144 shi and soaked seeds above 90% for each group. These methods are very beneficial for the promotion of agricultural technology.

In the patriotic production movement, some outstanding women were not only participants in agricultural production but also made significant achievements in increasing yield per unit area. For example, Pei Zhiying in Yushe County created a new record for high yield; her mutual aid group cultivated 194 mu of land. Based on the 1950 production, they planned to increase grain production by 30 shi, but the actual harvest last year was more than 266 shi, exceeding the original plan by 38 shi 1 dou 6 sheng, exceeding the 1950 production by 68 shi 1 dou 6 sheng. The Shi Niudi mutual aid group in Licheng cultivated 171 mu of land. Last year, the actual harvest was 329 shi 5 dou, averaging 1 shi 9 dou 2 sheng 7 he per mu, with the yield per mu increasing by 1 dou 8 sheng 7 he compared to 1950, exceeding the original production increase plan by 3 sheng 7 he. The Ma Baobei mutual aid group in Changzhi County cultivated 59.8 mu of land. Last year, the average yield per mu was 197.5 jin, exceeding the per-mu yield in 1950 by 16.5 jin. The Zhao Fengxian mutual aid group in Huguan harvested an average of 2 shi of grain per mu last year, exceeding the per-mu yield in 1950 by 6 dou. In addition, in the province's famous Hutuo River water conservancy project, 21,300 women participated, and 92 labor models emerged. In 125 villages in nine counties including Taigu, over 3,800 women participated in the tree planting movement, planting an average of four trees per person, and many women became tree-planting models. These examples powerfully criticize the feudal thinking that "women's labor is useless, they don't have the skills and just mess around." These facts prove that women and men have equally infinite wisdom and unlimited productive potential.

**How to Mobilize the Broad Masses of Women to Participate in Production**

The result of the province's vast female labor force participating in agricultural production makes it possible for us to carry out intensive farming, improve technology, expand industrial crops, and overcome various disasters, thus achieving a bumper harvest; it also provides experience in mobilizing women to participate in production:

*Patriotic Ideological Education on Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea is the Main Driving Force for Promoting Women's Participation in Production*

In the past year, after patriotic ideological education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, many women, such as Shi Niudi, Yan Xiangguo, and Ma Baobei, have combined their patriotic plans (such as donations, supporting the military, propaganda, etc.) with their production plans, forming patriotic covenants as their action program for patriotism. Wan Qize, a woman in Qinyuan County, not only increased her production to complete her donation plan of 350,000 yuan but also promoted 145 women in the village to donate 1,534,400 yuan from increased production. Shi Niudi in Licheng organized the group to engage in sideline production, earning 2,140,000 yuan. After she personally donated 100,000 yuan, the group donated a total of 700,000 yuan, and also promoted the village to donate 5,000,000 yuan. They were also selected as "model plowing groups" in the work of supporting families of revolutionary soldiers. Because of the increased political consciousness, women's patriotic production enthusiasm also increased. Labor model Pei Zhiying said: "Resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is the responsibility of everyone, and women should not lag behind. We must support the Volunteer Army with practical actions." She launched a patriotic bumper harvest competition among women throughout the province. In the month of March to April alone last year, over 160 women's mutual aid groups in 19 counties across the province participated in the patriotic production competition movement. The Shi Niudi group launched a challenge to women throughout the county, and women from over 40 villages responded. Zhang Xiaoguo mobilized 70% of the women in the village to participate in the competition, and Wang Cuifang led 86 women and men in the village to engage in the competition. Many women's mutual aid groups put forward combat slogans such as "Eliminate insect eggs, dig up grass roots, harvest more grain and plant rich roots, support Korea to fight the enemy," and "Men plant more flowers, women guarantee to bring them home," greatly encouraging women's labor enthusiasm. At the same time, the mutual aid groups were consolidated and developed in the production competition. According to statistics from 3,505 villages and four complete counties in 20 counties including Jincheng, Licheng, Tunliu, and Wuxiang, there are a total of 33,443 mutual aid groups, with 146,331 women laborers participating, accounting for 37.6% of the total female labor force. In five counties including Licheng, Lingchuan, and Yushe, the women organized in 1950 averaged 66%, and in 1951, it expanded to 74%. In new liberated areas such as Anyi, Fenyang, Xixian, Shouyang, and Qixian counties, the women organized last year also accounted for more than 10% of the female labor force.

*The Political Liberation of Women Must be Closely Combined with Economic Liberation*

As the song compiled by the women themselves, "Land reform turned over, cooperation and mutual aid planted rich roots, marriage freedom got married, women lived like people," expresses, in the past year, due to the improvement of political consciousness of the broad masses of women and the implementation of the Marriage Law, they have begun to break free from the feudal shackles of the old marriage system, embarked on the road of production and construction, and improved their social status. For example, the Changzhi Special District, while implementing the marriage policy, vigorously mobilized women to participate in production, and organized the money earned by women from various productions into cooperatives; a total of more than 340,000 women in the entire special district have joined the cooperatives, accounting for 27% of the total number of women in the entire special district. In addition to increased agricultural production last year, labor model Shi Niudi's sideline income reached 2,140,000 yuan. The cooperative helped her mutual aid group sell agricultural and sideline products, totaling 2,000,000 yuan, and supplied her group with production and living materials totaling 1,300,000 yuan. After women have a way to earn money, they established their position in society. Many men said: "Now women are different from before, we dare not underestimate them anymore!"

*Holding Women's Representative Conferences, Establishing Women's Labor Banners, and Timely Commending and Rewarding Women Labor Models are Important Methods for Comprehensively Mobilizing Women's Production*

Last year, each county generally held women's representative conferences. The representatives attending the conferences were mostly outstanding members of the women's masses. They have the closest ties with the masses. Through them, it is easy to concentrate the opinions of the masses and to implement various policies and tasks. Therefore, the patriotic education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and the implementation of the Marriage Law and production competitions are all vividly and powerfully expressed among the broad masses of women. However, if only attention is paid to comprehensive mobilization and not to cultivating banner backbones, it is impossible to push the movement to a climax. For example, there is a Pei Zhiying in Yushe, and the production performance of women in the whole county is great; there is a Liu Yueying in Zhaocheng, and the production performance of women in Zhaocheng is also great; the Zhang Xiaoguo mutual aid group selected twelve labor models in the spring, and the production enthusiasm of the whole group is very high. Therefore, not only should women be mobilized through women's representative conferences, but attention should also be paid to establishing banners and cultivating typical examples. This is a complete set of methods for mobilizing women to participate in production.

*When Mobilizing Women to Participate in Agricultural Production, Some Specific Issues Must be Resolved Well*

1.  Correctly handle the relationship between women and the family. In rural areas dominated by small-scale farming, a family is an economic unit. However, some women leave the family to participate in other mutual aid groups for production, which often conflicts with the family, resulting in affecting women's production. Many women go to partner with other families with their family's labor force and appropriately divide the work between men and women according to the needs of field labor and household chores. This not only resolves the conflict between the individual and the family but also gives full play to women's role in production. The latter method should be adopted in the future. 2. Adhere to the principle of "equal pay for equal work." In the past, Shanxi Province had unreasonable phenomena of unequal pay for equal work in this regard. This has been improved last year. For example, the Wang Panghai, Shi Niudi, and Ma Baobei mutual aid groups all implemented the method of "scoring according to work," which not only consolidated mutual aid but also improved women's labor efficiency. However, the implementation of this principle is not thorough enough in various places, and attention should be paid to adhering to it in the future. 3. Pay attention to establishing nurseries during busy farming seasons. A total of 185 "busy farming nurseries" or "childcare groups" have been organized throughout the province, overcoming the difficulties of women being burdened by children and providing conditions for women to participate in agricultural production. However, these childcare organizations have not been universally established and should be vigorously promoted.

In the past year, the contribution of rural women in Shanxi Province to agricultural production has been enormous. However, from the leadership point of view, many cadres still neglect to mobilize women to participate in production, and do not actively cultivate typical examples or commend models. From the perspective of the masses, the feudal remnants of underestimating women still seriously exist in some areas, and the marriage policy has not been universally and deeply implemented in some areas. These most important issues are the key issues that must be resolved in order to carry out a larger-scale production movement this year.

    山西省怎样发动农村妇女走上生产战线
    王丕绪  李德生
    山西省广大农村妇女，一年来经过抗美援朝爱国主义思想教育和婚姻法的普遍实施，政治觉悟空前提高。她们以高度的爱国热情，和男子一齐卷入了一九五一年的爱国主义的农业生产运动，作出了巨大成绩。
    妇女和男子同样具有无穷的智慧和无限的生产能力
    妇女参加生产，在老区约占妇女劳动力（除孕、产、疾病和老弱妇女外）的百分之九十左右，新区平均也达到了百分之五十。老区工作基础好的县，组织起来进行生产的，已达妇女总劳动力的百分之六十左右，一般县也达到了百分之十五左右；新区工作基础较好的县，平均也达到了百分之十左右。她们除了切草、喂牲口、担水、送饭等外一般的都直接参加了春耕、夏锄、秋收等主要劳动。如在积肥上，根据武乡、临县等七县所属一百九十八个村的调查，参加的妇女即达三千三百三十六人，共积各种肥料近九万担，每人平均达二十六担。在锄麦上，根据赵城等十一个县所属四十九个村的调查，参加的妇女达二千四百人，每人平均锄四亩。据阳城、沁源等三十五县所属十个区及九百六十五个村的调查，参加夏季锄苗的妇女就有十二万五千多人，共锄苗五十四万多亩，每人平均锄四亩多。在产棉区，全省三百多万亩棉田，从培植到收摘的一系列生产过程中，妇女投入的劳动力，约占全部棉田所需劳动力的一半。不少妇女，除参加一般田间劳作外，并积极地参加了全省农业技术改良运动，如兴修水利、改良土壤、推广新式农具、浸拌选种、拔除病株、捕杀害虫等。有少数先进妇女，如劳动模范石牛弟、阎仙果、王翠芳等的互助组，集体购买了新式步犁、玉米脱粒机、喷雾器等，实习试用，向群众示范。劳动模范甄秀珠为了推广优良品种，试办了“小农场”，推动了全村百分之八十的农户种植优种。岢岚县宋木沟村先进妇女提出了“技术送上门”的口号，亲自作发芽试验，挨门挨户宣传；李改枝、陈俊英等并亲自帮助群众进行温汤浸种。在扑灭棉蚜运动中，妇女劳动模范刘月英、申顺金、王腊花等首先使用喷雾器、“六六六”、棉蚜皂，消灭了棉蚜，并请周围村庄的农民群众去参观，提高了群众灭蚜的信心。根据长治、太谷、临汾等二十二县所属三百多个村的统计，参加夏季选种的妇女，就有三万多人，共选出优种小麦一万七千一百一十九石。据榆次等十七个县所属八个区及三百五十六个村统计，在消灭棉蚜时，参加的妇女有三万四千八百人，消灭了十万零三百四十五亩地的棉蚜，保证了棉花丰产。神池、昔阳等七县所属一百九十八个村，为了减少一九五二年的虫害，去年妇女刨烧了一千七百三十五亩地的谷茬。据榆社县二十三个村的调查，已有一百五十五个妇女互助组，参加的人数有一千零八十四人，一年来，她们除积肥一万五千担、送粪八千六百担、打土圪垃五百三十亩、填坑九十个、锄麦四千二百亩外，在技术改良方面，调换品种一百四十四石，浸拌种各组均达百分之九十以上，调剂土壤三百五十亩。各地妇女参加农业技术改良运动的方法，一般有如下几种：一是妇女参加了村技术委员会；二是男女合组互教互学，提高妇女技术；三是聘请技术员，临时传授。这些办法对推广农业技术都有很大好处。
    在爱国主义生产运动中，有一部分优秀妇女，不仅是农业生产的参加者，而且在提高单位面积产量上作出了很大成绩。如榆社县裴志英曾创造了丰产新纪录；她的互助组共种地一百九十四亩，原计划在一九五零年的基础上增产原粮三十石，去年实收粮二百六十六石多，超过原计划三十八石一斗六，超过一九五零年产量六十八石一斗六。黎城石牛弟互助组共种地一百七十一亩，去年实收粮三百二十九石五斗，每亩平均一石九斗二升七，每亩产量比一九五零年提高一斗八升七，超过原增产计划三升七。长治县马宝贝互助组共种地五十九亩八分，去年每亩平均收粮一百九十七斤半，超过一九五零年每亩产量一十六斤半。壶关赵凤仙互助组，去年全组每亩平均收粮二石，超过一九五零年每亩产量六斗。此外，在全省著名的滹沱河水利工程中，参加的妇女达二万一千三百人，其中并涌现出九十二个劳动模范。太谷等九县的一百二十五个村，有三千八百多个妇女参加了植树运动，每人平均植树四株，也有许多妇女成为植树模范。这些范例，有力地批判了认为“妇女劳动不顶事，没有技术瞎胡混”的轻视妇女的封建思想。这些事实，证明妇女和男子同样具有无限的智慧和无限的生产潜在能力。
    怎样发动广大妇女群众参加生产
    全省广大的妇女劳动力投入农业生产的结果，使我们在农业生产上有可能进行精耕细作，改进技术，扩大工艺作物，战胜各种灾害，因而得到了丰产；同时也提供了发动妇女参加生产的经验：
    抗美援朝的爱国主义思想教育是推动妇女参加生产的主要动力
    过去一年来，经过抗美援朝的爱国主义思想教育后，妇女中很多人，如石牛弟、阎仙果、马宝贝等，都把她们的爱国计划（如捐献、优军、宣传等）和生产计划结合起来，订成了爱国公约，作为她们爱国的行动纲领。沁源县的妇女万七则除了个人增加生产完成了捐献三十五万元的计划外，并推动了全村一百四十五个妇女，从增产中捐献了一百五十三万四千元。黎城石牛弟组织全组搞副业生产赚了二百一十四万元，除去她个人捐献十万元外，全组共捐献七十万元，还推动全村捐献了五百万元；她们在优待革命军人家属的工作方面，又被选为“代耕模范组”。因为政治觉悟提高，妇女的爱国生产热情也随之高涨。劳动模范裴志英说：“抗美援朝，人人有责，妇女不应落后，我们要以实际行动来支援志愿军。”她曾发动了全省妇女的爱国丰产竞赛。仅去年三月到四月一个月内，全省就有十九个县的一百六十多个妇女互助组参加了爱国生产竞赛运动。石牛弟组发起了向全县妇女挑战，应战的有四十多个村的妇女。张小果发动了全村百分之七十的妇女参加了竞赛，王翠芳带领全村八十六个妇女和男子展开了竞赛。很多妇女互助组在竞赛时提出了“除虫卵、刨草根、多打粮食扎富根，支援朝鲜打敌人”，“男人多种花，妇女保证收回家”等战斗口号，大大鼓舞了妇女的劳动热情。同时，在生产竞赛中又巩固和发展了互助组。根据晋城、黎城、屯留、武乡等二十个县所属三千五百零五个村及四个完整县的统计，共有互助组三万三千四百四十三个，其中参加的妇女劳动力有十四万六千三百三十一个，占妇女总劳动力的百分之三十七点六。黎城、陵川、榆社等五县，一九五零年组织起来的妇女平均到百分之六十六，一九五一年扩大为百分之七十四。新区安邑、汾阳、隰县、寿阳、祁县等县，去年组织起来的妇女，也有妇女劳动力的百分之十以上。
    妇女在政治上的解放，必须和经济上的解放密切结合
    正如妇女们自己编的“土地改革翻了身，合作互助栽富根，婚姻自主结了婚，妇女们活的像了人。”这首歌所表现的一样，一年来，由于广大妇女政治觉悟的提高和婚姻法的贯彻，她们已开始摆脱了旧婚姻制度的封建枷锁，走入了生产建设的大道，提高了自己的社会地位。如长治专区在贯彻婚姻政策的同时，大力发动妇女参加生产，把妇女从各种生产中所赚的钱，又组织到合作社方面去；共计全专区入社妇女已有三十四万多名，占全专区妇女总数的百分之二十七。劳动模范石牛弟去年除农业增产外，副业收入达二百一十四万元，合作社帮助她的互助组推销农、副业产品，总值达二百万元，供给她组的生产资料和生活资料总值达一百三十万元。妇女们在经济上有了办法以后，确立了自己在社会上的地位。许多男人们说：“现在妇女可和从前不一样啦，再不敢小看啦！”
    召开妇女代表会议，树立妇女劳动旗帜，及时表扬奖励妇女劳动模范，是全面发动妇女生产的重要方法
    去年各县普遍召开了妇女代表会议，出席会议的代表，多是妇女群众中的优秀分子。她们和群众有最密切的联系。经过她们，既便于集中群众的意见，又便于贯彻各种政策和任务。因此抗美援朝的爱国主义教育和贯彻婚姻政策以及生产竞赛等，在广大的妇女群众中，都表现得生动有力。但只注意全面发动，而不注意培养旗帜骨干，就不可能使运动推向高潮。如榆社有个裴志英，全县妇女生产成绩就大；赵城有个刘月英，赵城妇女生产成绩也大；张小果互助组在春季评选出了十二个劳动模范，全组生产情绪都很高。所以，不仅要通过妇女代表会去发动妇女，并且要注意树立旗帜，培养典型。这是发动妇女参加生产的一套完整方法。
    在发动妇女参加农业生产时，有些具体问题必须很好地解决
    一、要正确处理妇女和家庭的关系。在小农经济为主的农村中，一个家庭就是一个经济单位；但有些妇女离开家庭而参加到别的互助组去进行生产，常和家庭发生矛盾，结果影响了妇女生产。有不少妇女和自己家庭的劳动力一起去和别家合伙碰组，并根据田间劳动和家庭零活的需要，适当地进行男女分工，这样既解决了个人和家庭的矛盾，也发挥了妇女在生产中的作用。后一种办法是今后应该采取的。二、要坚持“同工同酬”的原则。过去山西省在这方面曾有同工不同酬的不合理现象。这在去年有了改进，如王胖孩、石牛弟、马宝贝等互助组，都实行了“按活评分”的办法，既巩固了互助，又提高了妇女的劳动效率。但各地对这个原则贯彻得还不够彻底，今后还应注意坚持贯彻。三、注意建立农忙托儿所。全省共已组织了一百八十五个“农忙托儿所”或“看孩组”，克服了妇女受孩子牵累的困难，给妇女参加农业生产提供了条件。但这些托儿组织还没有普遍建立，还应该大力推广。
    一年来山西省农村妇女在农业生产上的贡献是巨大的。但从领导方面看，还有不少干部忽视发动妇女参加生产，不主动积极地培养典型，表扬模范；从群众方面来看，轻视妇女的封建残余思想，在部分地区还严重地存在着，婚姻政策在一些地区也还没有普遍深入地贯彻下去。这些最主要的问题，是今年开展更大规模的生产运动必须解决的关键问题。
