Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: Medical and health workers across the country are actively taking action and organizing themselves, stepping onto the front lines of the anti-bacterial warfare effort to deliver a forceful counterattack against the American aggressors who are using bacteriological weapons.

    Following the establishment of the Chinese Medical Association's Special Committee for the Prevention of Germ Warfare on February 22nd in Beijing, it has already held two meetings on February 27th and March 5th. During the meetings, Tang Feifan, Director of the Biological Products Research Institute of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and a bacteriology expert, was elected as Chairman, and Xu Yan as Vice Chairman. The committee discussed the germ warfare defense plan and passed its organizational rules.

    More than thirty medical professors and medical workers in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, gathered on February 29th. At the meeting, a special committee for germ warfare defense was established. On the spot, five people, including Yan Xifeng, professor of bacteriology at Jiangxi Medical College, voluntarily signed up to join the anti-American, aid-Korea epidemic prevention and inspection team. More than two hundred students from Jiangxi Medical College gathered to denounce the crimes of the U.S. military in conducting germ warfare and unanimously requested to go to Korea to participate in treatment and epidemic prevention work.

    In the Western Sichuan region, more than 1,290 scientific and health workers in Chengdu City formed an "Anti-American, Aid-Korea Epidemic Prevention Team," ready to respond to the call to rush to the Korean front at any time. Zhang Wenman, an infectious disease expert and deputy director of the Western Sichuan Infectious Disease Hospital, wrote in his letter of determination: "The duty of human infectious disease workers is to eliminate various infectious pathogens, but the American aggressors are manufacturing large quantities of pathogens to kill people; therefore, the American aggressor troops are the mortal enemies of scientific and health workers all over the world. To protect the safety of the Korean-Chinese forces and the Korean people, I am determined to go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare!" To strengthen research on germ warfare defense, the preparatory committee of the Western Sichuan Science Popularization Association and the Chengdu Health Workers Association have jointly formed the Western Sichuan Region Scientific and Health Workers Germ Warfare Defense Special Committee, with more than thirty members including Zhou Xude, director of the Department of Bacteriology at West China University.

    All personnel of the Plague Prevention Institute of the Northeast People's Government Health Department and the Northeast Infectious Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital, as well as health workers in Andong City, unanimously stated: Today we have the strength and confidence to eliminate the disasters created by the American and Japanese bacterial criminals for mankind, and we are ready to respond to the call at any time to go to the Korean front to participate in epidemic prevention work.

    The Qingdao Medical Workers Union called on medical workers throughout the city to strengthen research on germ warfare defense, conduct publicity and explanation to the people of the city, provide popular materials for understanding germ warfare, and continue to organize medical and epidemic prevention teams to go to Korea.
