The people of Jujia Kiln Village in Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, who once suffered from Japanese germ warfare, immediately launched a tearful indictment and lodged a stern protest after hearing the news that American invaders were colluding with Japanese germ warfare criminals to wage germ warfare in Korea.

The people of Jujia Kiln Village are currently preparing for spring plowing, but must also quickly launch epidemic prevention activities. People remember who left this epidemic behind!

It was in the winter of 1942 when the Japanese invaders sent motor vehicle corps and airplanes to force the people of Jujia Kiln Village to demolish houses, report land, and move. The Japanese invaders established an underground germ factory with airport equipment in an area of ​​seven li in the village. During the day, the Japanese invaders forced the local people to "donate" live mice, flies, and livestock hair; at night, they secretly came out to kidnap people. Twenty people were kidnapped at one time on Xingya Street in the county, and their whereabouts were never known. According to Ju San, a landlord who used to collude with a translator surnamed Sun in the factory, the kidnapped people were used for germ experiments.

The Japanese invaders set up a "restricted area" around the factory. People could only see cars covered with cloth constantly entering and exiting from a distance, and planes taking off and landing non-stop. People also saw Japanese invaders in white clothes driving thin cattle, horses, pigs, and sheep, walking back and forth from time to time. At night, people could only hear the sound of machines running. This "secret military town" was the Second Division – a plague and flea factory – of "Unit 731" directly led by the war criminal Shiro Ishii, as confessed by Japanese germ warfare criminal Kiyoshi Kawashima, who was tried by the Military Tribunal of the Soviet Maritime Territory.

When the Japanese invaders surrendered, in order to cover up their heinous crimes, they burned down the factory, but their criminal acts were exposed by the people one by one. People who went to the factory saw countless deep ditches, large holes, and small holes. Farmer Ju Shouchong saw live mice in iron cages in a large hole, and rows of dead mice on wooden racks; the ground was full of broken medicine bottles and powder; some wooden barrels contained colored medicine. Another large pit exposed unburied dead horses, and there were five large pits full of corpses. After the inhuman Japanese invaders took the lives of tens of millions of innocent people, they released a large number of germs when they were about to collapse, so that terrible epidemics threatened the residents of the surrounding villages. In 1945 and 1946, plague, typhoid, glanders, cattle plague, and other epidemics occurred several times in this area, with patients in every household and deaths in every village. Of Huang Jifang's family of twenty-one, nine died of the epidemic; half of Liu Jingbin's family of eight died. Until today, under the vigorous prevention and treatment of the People's Government, the man-eating epidemic has been eliminated in this area. However, various animal epidemics have not stopped, and pigs and chickens cannot be raised in each household. Therefore, while preparing for spring plowing, the people of Jujia Kiln Village also have to carry out prevention and control work for "foot-and-mouth disease".

When the people of Jujia Kiln Village were continuing to fight against the disasters left by the Japanese invaders, their anger reached its peak when they heard the news that American invaders were colluding with Japanese war criminals to wage germ warfare in Korea. On the evening of February 26, people held an indictment meeting. Facing the mass-murder factory with bones everywhere in front of the village, recalling the painful disasters, everyone had endless grievances to tell. Wang Yonggui, an old man who was kidnapped by the Japanese invaders in 1942 on Lunar New Year's Eve to build a germ factory, angrily denounced the situation of being forced to move by the Japanese invaders in the severe cold with snow and ice and howling north wind. He said: "We must seize Shiro Ishii and make him pay back blood and money, and settle all old scores!" Everyone gritted their teeth in anger when they heard the name of war criminal Shiro Ishii. Huang Jifang, whose family lost nine people to the epidemic, denounced the tragic deaths of his family members, saying: "My son was still playing and laughing while eating breakfast, but suddenly died by dinner time. I want the Japanese war criminals to return my son!" Finally, everyone at the indictment meeting unanimously expressed that they would actively increase production, strive to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, severely punish the American imperialists and Japanese germ warfare criminals, and pay off the blood debts owed for many years!

    愤怒的控诉
    新华社记者  曹克
    曾遭受日寇细菌毒害的黑龙江省安达县鞠家窑村人民，听到美国侵略者勾结日本细菌战犯在朝鲜进行细菌战争的消息后，立即进行了血泪的控诉和提出了严正的抗议。
    鞠家窑村人民目前正紧张地准备春耕，但又要迅速地展开防疫活动。人们都记得，这疫病是谁给留下来的！
    那是在一九四二年冬，日寇派来了汽车兵团，又来了飞机，强迫鞠家窑村人民拆房、报地和搬家。日寇在该村以方圆七华里的地区，建立起一个带有飞机场设备的地下细菌工厂。日寇白天强迫当地人民“献纳”活老鼠、苍蝇和牲畜毛；夜间偷偷地出来抓人。该县兴亚街一次即被抓去二十名，后来一直没有下落。据过去常和工厂里一位姓孙的翻译有勾结的地主鞠三说：被抓去的人都作了细菌试验。
    日寇在工厂周围设立“禁区”。人们只能从远处看到带着罩布的汽车整天出入不断，飞机起落不停。人们还看到有穿白衣服的日寇赶着瘦牛、瘦马、猪、羊，不时地走来走去。到夜间，人们只听到机器的转动声。这个“秘密的军用市镇”，就是苏联滨海军区军事法庭审判的日本细菌战犯川岛清所供认的战犯石井四郎直接领导下“第七三一部队”的第二处——鼠疫、跳蚤工厂。
    日寇投降时，为掩盖其滔天罪行，曾将该厂烧毁，但其罪恶行为都被人民一一揭露了。人们到厂内曾看见无数深沟、大洞、小洞。农民鞠守忠在一个大洞里看到铁笼里装着活老鼠，在木架上还摆着成排的死老鼠；地下全是摔破的药瓶和药粉；有些木桶里还有带色的药水。另一个大坑里露着未掩埋好的死马，还有五个满装着尸骨的大坑。绝灭人性的日寇夺去了千万个无罪人民的生命后，临溃退时又放出大批病菌，使可怕的疫病威胁着这一带村庄的居民。一九四五、四六两年，这一带曾几次发生鼠疫、伤寒、马鼻疽、牛疫等疫病，家家有病人，村村有死人。黄继芳一家二十一口人，得疫病死去了九口；刘景彬八口人，死去了一半。直至今日，在人民政府的大力防治下，这一带才消灭了吃人的疫病。但各种畜疫仍没停止，各家养不活猪、鸡。所以，鞠家窑村的人民在准备春耕中，还要进行防治“口蹄疫”的工作。
    鞠家窑村人民在继续与日寇遗留下来的灾难进行搏斗的时候，听到美国侵略者勾结日本战犯在朝鲜进行细菌战争的消息，人们的愤怒达到极点。二月二十六日晚上，人们举行了一个控诉会，人们面对着村前白骨遍地的杀人工厂，忆起痛心的灾难，每人都有诉不完的冤仇。曾在一九四二年旧历除夕被日寇抓去修建细菌工厂的老汉王永贵，愤怒地控诉了当年在遍地雪冰、北风怒吼的严寒里被日寇强迫搬家的情形。他说：“我们一定要抓住石井四郎叫他还血、还钱，算清一切旧账！”人们一听到战犯石井四郎，个个愤怒得咬牙切齿。被疫病夺去了九口人的黄继芳，控诉一家人死亡的惨状说：“我的儿子吃早饭时，还又玩又笑的，到晚饭时就突然死去。我要日本战犯还我的儿子！”最后，控诉会上大家一致表示要更加积极生产，努力支援中国人民志愿军，严惩美帝国主义者和日本细菌战犯，还清欠下多年的血债！
