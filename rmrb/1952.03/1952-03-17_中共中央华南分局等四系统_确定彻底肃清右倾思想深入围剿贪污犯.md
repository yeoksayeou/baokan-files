The anti-corruption struggle in the agencies under the four major units of the CCP Central South China Bureau, the South China Branch of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government is now undergoing a period of rest and consolidation after the end of the second campaign, in order to consolidate and develop the victory. The results of the second campaign were greater than those of the first. This is primarily the result of vigorously criticizing and overcoming the right-leaning thinking of leading cadres, and secondly, the gradual learning of how to use the "three treasures" (the masses, policies, and materials) in the struggle, with the leading organs promptly proposing the tactic of "attacking the heart and fighting with wits." However, although the current achievements are great, they are still far from "cleaning up" corruption completely. The future "tiger" hunting movement will enter a period of more serious struggle. Ye Jianying, the person in charge of the four major units, has already made important instructions on the future struggle at a meeting of party member cadres held on the 10th, mobilizing everyone to continue fighting to consolidate and develop the victory.

The victorious process of the anti-corruption struggle in various agencies over the past month has also been a process of opposing right-leaning thought. The leadership has determined that it is necessary to continue to oppose right-leaning thought in the future and completely overthrow the "ideological tigers." Currently, the manifestations of right-leaning thought are: being satisfied with the achievements already made, thus failing to see the more hidden and vicious "tigers"; failing to see that there are still gaps in some units and "dead corners" in some agencies; and the so-called "talent viewpoint" that condones corrupt elements has not been completely eliminated. In addition, there is the view of seeking simplicity and convenience, adopting hasty and stiff methods to deal with extremely cunning "tigers," which is a manifestation of insufficient understanding of the seriousness of the struggle and also a manifestation of right-leaning thought. Faced with a more serious struggle, the leadership instructed that investigation and research must be particularly emphasized, and that it must be recognized that the "masses, policies, and materials" are indispensable, with material evidence being the central link. Conducting arduous and meticulous investigation and research work and mastering material evidence are necessary conditions for deepening the struggle and necessary conditions for consolidating and developing the victory.

Currently, all units in the city are carrying out a period of rest and consolidation in accordance with the specific situation. During the rest period, experiences are being summarized to improve tactics; "dead corners" are being cleared to make the movement more widespread and in-depth; the ranks are being rectified and cadres are being adjusted (including strengthening the ranks of the "Five-Anti" movement and restoring the main businesses of various agencies); the results of the battle are being cleared, stolen goods are being recovered, and cases are being determined; and in conjunction with the "Five-Anti" movement, materials are being grasped to encircle from both inside and outside.

    中共中央华南分局等四系统
    确定彻底肃清右倾思想深入围剿贪污犯
    中共中央华南分局、中南军政委员会财政经济委员会华南分会、广东省人民政府和广州市人民政府等四大单位所属各机关的反贪污斗争在结束第二个战役后，现正进行休整，以便巩固胜利和发展胜利。第二个战役的战果比第一个战役更大。这首先是大力批判和克服领导干部的右倾思想的结果，其次是在斗争中逐渐学会了运用“三宝”（群众、政策、材料），领导机关及时提出了“攻心斗智”的战法。但是现在的成绩虽然很大，距离“打干净”还很远。今后的打“虎”运动将进入更严重的斗争的时期。四大单位的负责人叶剑英已在十日举行的党员干部会议中对今后的斗争做了重要的指示，动员大家为巩固胜利和发展胜利而继续战斗。
    各机关一个多月来反贪污斗争的胜利过程同时就是反对右倾思想的过程。领导方面确定今后还要反对右倾思想，彻底打倒“思想老虎”。目前右倾思想的表现是：满足于既得的成绩，因而看不见更隐蔽更恶毒的“老虎”；看不到有些单位还有空隙，有些机关里还有“死角”；姑息贪污分子的所谓“人材观点”还没有彻底肃清。此外，存在贪图简单省事的观点，采取急躁生硬的方法来对付极其狡猾的“老虎”，这是对斗争的严重性认识不足，也是右倾思想的表现。由于面临更严重的斗争，领导方面指示必须特别强调调查研究，必须认识“群众、政策、材料”三者不可缺一，而材料证据是中心的一环。艰苦细致地进行调查研究工作，掌握材料证据，是斗争深入的必要条件，是巩固胜利和发展胜利的必要条件。
    目前全市各单位正按照具体情况进行一次休整。在休整期间进行总结经验，提高战术；清查“死角”，使运动普遍深入，整顿队伍，调整干部（包括加强“五反”运动的队伍，各机关主要业务的恢复等）；清查战果，追赃定案；并结合“五反”，掌握材料，内外合围。
