Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 28th. The workers and shop assistants in the industrial and commercial households inspected in Shanghai actively cooperated with the "Five-Anti" work inspection team to investigate the illegal activities of capitalists. When the inspection team entered various private factories and shops, they were generally warmly welcomed by the workers and shop assistants. Some workers and shop assistants set off firecrackers, while others broadcast welcome speeches, and their emotions were extremely excited. Many blackboards and large-character posters in factories and shops wrote about the arrival of the inspection team. When the inspection team arrived at the private Tianzhang Paper Mill, more than 100 employee representatives lined up to welcome them, shouting: "Welcome to the 'Five-Anti' Inspection Team," "Resolutely defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks." Employees told each other: "The government has sent people, we have a way now."

After the inspection team entered the factories and shops, the employees helped the inspection team collect materials and expose the illegal activities of the capitalists. The workers and staff of Mingchang Wood Company held a recollection meeting together and jointly presented important illegal materials of the奸商 (crafty merchant) Diao Jinwen on sabotaging the Liberation War and national defense construction. For example, in November 1949, the East China Trade Company exchanged Northeast pine for his foreign pine to build ships to liberate Zhoushan. Diao Jinwen replaced it with short and rotten wood accounting for half of the total. When constructing a certain national defense project, Diao Jinwen sold wood with 20 percent hollow, rotten core, and cracks to the government. The employees of the private Zhonghua Iron Factory, in response to the situation of the illegal capitalist Fu Shoupou falsely reporting labor and materials and drastically cutting corners, organized a accounting check, work estimation, and material estimation team. Under the leadership of the inspection team, they checked his illegal acts of cutting corners according to the ordering and processing contracts and drawings signed by the government and Fu Shoupou. The work and material estimation team calculated the actual labor and materials used for several major projects from 1950 to 1951 within four days. The accounting team quickly calculated the serious illegal facts of Fu Shoupou's cutting corners based on the materials from the work and material estimation teams. In addition, during the inspection, the employees also organized picket teams and propaganda teams to be responsible for defending production and carrying out propaganda and mobilization work. They conducted two to three political appeals every day to urge illegal capitalists to confess and start anew.

The trade union grassroots organizations in each inspected household actively cooperated with the "Five-Anti" inspection team to mobilize the masses and win over and unite senior employees. After the inspection team entered the Huaxin Instrument & Stationery Factory, the trade union organized a "Five-Anti" branch. By telling about their sufferings and explaining the policies, they first mobilized all employees and united senior employees to participate in the struggle. Then, the factory's trade union organized several combat teams to launch face-to-face struggles against illegal capitalists.

With the close cooperation of workers, shop assistants, and staff, the inspection work has been rapidly developed. Most of the seventy-four illegal industrial and commercial households that began key inspections on the 21st have been solved. Feng Yixiang, the owner of the Merlin Canning Food Factory, has always cut corners and stolen state property. When the inspection team came to the factory to inspect this time, he cleverly refused to admit it. Later, the employees cooperated with the inspection team to expose his illegal facts one by one, and he had to bow his head and confess, admitting that he had stolen more than 10 billion yuan of state property.

### 上海“五反”工作检查队得到职工热烈支持  重点检查的违法工商户大部破案

    上海“五反”工作检查队得到职工热烈支持
    重点检查的违法工商户大部破案
    【新华社上海二十八日电】上海市被检查工商户中的工人、店员，积极配合“五反”工作检查队清查资本家的违法行为。检查队进入各私营厂店时，普遍受到工人、店员的热烈欢迎。工人、店员有的燃放鞭炮，有的播送欢迎词，情绪极为振奋。许多厂、店里的黑板报、大字报都写了欢迎检查队的消息。检查队到达私营天章造纸厂时，该厂一百多个职工代表排队欢迎，高呼：“欢迎‘五反’检查队”，“坚决打垮资产阶级的猖狂进攻”。职工们竞相传告：“政府派人来了，我们有办法了。”
    检查队进入厂店以后，职工们都帮助检查队收集材料，揭发资本家的违法行为。明昌木号的工人和职员在一起开了回忆会，共同提出奸商刁锦文破坏解放战争和国防建设的重要违法材料。如一九四九年十一月，华东区贸易公司以东北松换他的洋松，造船解放舟山。刁锦文竟以占总数一半的短木料和烂木料顶替。在建筑某国防工程时，刁锦文又以百分之二十的空头、烂心、裂缝的木料卖给政府。私营中华铁工厂的职工针对违法资本家傅守璞虚报人工、材料，大肆偷工减料的情况，组织了查账、估工、估料小组。在检查队的领导下，他们根据政府和傅守璞订立的定货、加工合同及图样，检查其偷工减料的违法行为。估工、估料组在四天内就把一九五零年到一九五一年间的几项大工程实用的人工、材料计算出来。查账组根据估工、估料两组的材料迅速地计算出傅守璞偷工减料的严重违法事实。此外，在检查期间职工们还组织了纠察组和宣传组，负责保卫生产和进行宣传鼓动工作。他们每天进行两次到三次的政治喊话，促使违法资本家坦白自新。
    各被检查户的工会基层组织都积极地配合“五反”检查队发动群众，争取、团结高级职员。华新仪器文具厂的工会在检查队进厂后，就组织了“五反”支会，他们通过诉苦、讲明政策，首先把全体职工发动起来，并团结高级职员参加斗争。接着，该厂工会又组织若干战斗小组，向违法资本家展开面对面的斗争。
    在工人、店员和职员的密切配合下，检查工作都得到了迅速的开展。二十一日开始重点检查的七十四户违法工商户，已大部分破案。梅林罐头食品厂的老板冯义祥一贯偷工减料，盗窃国家资财。这次检查队到该厂检查时，他还狡猾不承认。后来职工们配合检查队把他的违法事实一一揭露了出来，他才不得不低头认罪，承认曾盗窃国家资财一百多亿元。
