Chahar Province has a high altitude and a short frost-free period. Last year, it suffered from severe disasters such as drought, hail, insects, and frost. However, Chi Wanku, a labor model from Taishizhuang, Yanggao County, achieved a high yield of over 920 jin of millet (foxtail millet) per mu and over 7,300 jin of potatoes per mu. In order to summarize and promote Chi Wanku's advanced experience, the Chahar Provincial People's Government organized a high-yield investigation team to conduct on-site investigations in Taishizhuang. The investigation team included more than 20 cadres from the Chahar Provincial Communist Party Committees at all levels, People's Governments at all levels, and farms at all levels. The following are the results of our investigation.

I. High-Yield Achievements

Chi Wanku has a total of 4.749 mu of paddy land and 6 mu of dry land. The main high-yield achievements are: 1.149 mu of paddy land planted with millet, with a yield of 926.83 jin per mu, which is 4.19 times the average millet yield per mu of local farmers (221 jin) and 3.96 times the millet yield per mu (234 jin) of his neighbor Zhang Runyuan, who planted the same variety; moreover, the millet grains were full, weighing 14 jin per shi (local farmers' millet generally weighs 13 to 13.5 jin per dou). 0.36 mu of paddy land planted with potatoes, with a yield equivalent to 7,321 jin per mu, which is two to four times the potato yield per mu of local farmers. The remaining 0.74 mu of paddy land planted with potatoes was harvested and stored together with his son-in-law's land, as the land was adjacent, and the yield is no longer verifiable. In addition, 1.6 mu of paddy land was planted with broad beans in the first season, yielding three shi; in the second season, 0.8 mu was planted with tobacco, yielding 120 jin, and the remaining 0.8 mu was planted with soybeans to maintain soil fertility. Another 0.9 mu of paddy land was planted with garlic in the first season, yielding a total of 280 strings (40 heads per string); intercropped with carrots, yielding 4,000 jin; 3 mu of dry land was planted with millet, yielding 35 dou. The yields of all kinds of crops on both paddy and dry land were higher than the general yields of local farmers.

II. Reasons for High Yield

1. Creating High-Yield Conditions Through Labor

(I) Improving the Soil: Chi Wanku's millet field was originally third-class paddy land (paddy land in this village is divided into three classes), with low-lying terrain, many gravels, poor soil quality, and a shallow soil layer. Chi Wanku picked up large gravels from the field and piled them on the edge of the field to prevent flooding from washing away the topsoil. He also dug water storage ditches along the field edge near the road and a deep water storage pond at the other end of the field, connected to the water storage ditches. After heavy rains, floods from the upper reaches carried a large amount of sediment. Upon reaching the pond, the flow slowed down, and the sediment naturally settled. This alluvial soil is all topsoil from the upper reaches, fully weathered, and very fertile. If there was excessive water accumulation in the millet field after rain, Chi Wanku would divert the water to the storage pond to prevent the fertile water from flowing away. In winter, all the accumulated sediment from the ditches and ponds was dug up and poured into the field. Last winter alone, more than 20 carts of silt and quicksand were added. In this way, the water storage pond gradually deepened, and through digging up sediment to cushion the land, the topsoil of the cultivated land gradually thickened. Moreover, the sediment was near the land, requiring less labor. After years of embankment and compaction, coupled with heavy fertilization, deep plowing, and fine harrowing, Chi Wanku's paddy land is now moist and black in color, with a moderate sand content, not only very fertile but also with a good structure. The land of farmers Zhang Runheng and Yang Congxian in the same village is adjacent to Chi Wanku's land, but the soil is heavy and the structure is hard, which is very different compared to Chi Wanku's land.

(II) Accumulating a Large Amount of Fertilizer and Applying Fertilizer Rationally: Chi Wanku paid great attention to raising sheep to accumulate manure and utilizing urine fertilizer. He initially only raised two sheep, and through years of careful feeding, the number of sheep continuously increased, and in recent years, he has consistently kept 21 sheep. The manure from these sheep has become the main fertilizer for Chi Wanku's crops. The proportion of sheep manure mixed with soil is generally four parts manure to six parts soil. During the summer and autumn, when there is more sheep manure, the proportion can reach half manure and half soil. (The general proportion of manure to soil among farmers is mostly three parts manure to seven parts soil, or two parts manure to eight parts soil.) Whenever he had free time, he would carry a basket to collect manure. Whenever he saw traces of urine from pigs, dogs, livestock, or people, he would shovel it into the basket along with the wet soil. He paid great attention to urine fertilizer, saying, "Everyone picks up manure, but how much can you pick up? It's a great waste not to pick up the good urine fertilizer." Chi Wanku raises many sheep and diligently collects manure, accumulating at least 30 carts of manure each year, and the fertilizer is of good quality. After years of fertilization, the organic matter in the soil has gradually increased, and the soil particle structure has gradually improved. Last year, on average, six carts of high-quality sheep pen manure were applied per mu, equivalent to approximately 11,000 to 12,000 jin; 0.36 mu of potato land was applied with three carts of sheep pen manure, equivalent to approximately 5,500 to 6,000 jin. Calculating based solely on the amount of manure, it is about three to five times the amount of fertilizer applied by the average local people. Chi Wanku paid close attention to the sheep's feed when raising sheep to accumulate fertilizer. He usually fed each sheep one he of soybeans or black beans every day; after the autumn harvest, he added some leftover potato scraps and vegetable remnants. These organic materials, after being digested by livestock, do not decrease in fertility and are easier to decompose, making them more cost-effective than using them as compost or stir-frying black beans to fertilize the fields. Chi Wanku's emphasis on urine fertilizer is also reasonable because animal manure is mainly feed residue, rich in fiber, which is not easily utilized by crops. Its main effect is to increase soil temperature, loosen the soil, and increase the soil's water retention and nutrient absorption capacity, which is not as effective as animal urine fertilizer, which can be directly absorbed by crops. In terms of composition, urine contains more nitrogen, and most of the potassium is in the urine; in terms of quantity, humans or livestock excrete more urine than manure every day.

2. Breaking the Old Farming Methods from Plowing to Harvesting

(I) Paying Attention to Crop Rotation, Never Repeated Planting: Although Chi Wanku does not have much land, both paddy and dry land are divided into several groups for alternating crop rotation. Sometimes leguminous crops are planted to maintain and restore soil fertility; sometimes vegetables are planted with a large amount of fertilizer to enhance nutrients. The land he planted with millet last year was previously planted with potatoes, taking advantage of the deeper soil turning when harvesting potatoes and the greater accumulation of nutrients; the land he planted with potatoes last year was previously planted with millet, taking advantage of the shallower millet roots and the underutilization of nutrients in the lower layers. However, he does not rotate millet and potatoes every year but mainly looks at the soil conditions and appropriately rotates millet, potatoes, beans, and vegetables. In this way, fertility can be fully utilized, the soil can be properly restored and maintained, and the harm of pests and diseases parasitic in the soil can be reduced.

(II) Intensive Cultivation: The previous crop on the millet field was potatoes. The use of iron shovels to dig the soil when harvesting potatoes was already beneficial for deep plowing. Another deep plowing was carried out before freezing, without harrowing, allowing the soil clumps to stand up, fully sun-dried and weathered, killing insect eggs and pests lurking in the soil, and allowing snow to accumulate in winter and sand to accumulate in spring (because the local terrain is high, if the land is harrowed flat, snow and sand are easily blown away by the wind). After thawing, it was harrowed once to loosen and break up the soil, reducing water evaporation; then, it was leveled with a scraper to make the land flat before irrigation. After the land was slightly dry, it was harrowed again to allow air to circulate in the soil, avoiding agglomeration, and allowing full spring sun exposure. Before sowing, manure was spread first, followed by another plowing, slightly shallower than the autumn plowing, to avoid turning up the bottom soil, which is not conducive to crop growth. This was followed by one harrowing, one raking, and one more fine harrowing. In this way, the soil was turned three times (including once when harvesting the previous crop) and harrowed a total of five times. The soil was fully broken up, evenly mixed up and down, which is extremely beneficial to the development and elongation of crop roots. His potato field was dug with an iron shovel because the previous crop was millet. Although this method is slightly more labor-intensive, it plows deeper and more evenly than the old plows. As for plowing, harrowing, and cultivating, they were the same as for the millet field. Although both were autumn plowing, the method was different depending on the previous crop and the needs of the later crop, either plowing with a plow or digging with a shovel. From this, it can be seen that his cultivation method is extremely meticulous and thorough.

(III) Careful Seed Selection: Chi Wanku used to plant "Bai Yousha" and "Qitou Bai" millet varieties, which did not yield high yields. In 1951, he grasped the three favorable conditions of being able to irrigate at any time in the village, later and lighter frost damage than other villages, and having more accumulated fertilizer, so he went to Sunrenbao Village to exchange for the fertilizer-tolerant and water-loving, but longer-growing, high-yielding variety "Dongfang Liang." After the variety was selected, it was repeatedly screened and winnowed to remove shriveled grains. Last autumn, he selected seeds by the panicle, removing the small panicles at the top and base, and only taking the most full part in the middle. As for planting potatoes, he not only paid attention to selecting appropriate varieties and moderate-sized tubers but also strictly selected buds. When storing potato seeds, he paid attention to maintaining an appropriate temperature in the cellar to allow the tubers to sprout tender buds slightly, without letting them sprout too long. According to him, if the buds sprout too long, they are easily injured during planting, and the seedlings are relatively weak. When cutting the seeds, he selected the buds one by one, leaving only one bud per piece and cutting off the rest. This ensures reliable germination, avoids missing plants, makes it easier to emerge from the soil, and produces particularly strong seedlings.

(IV) Paying Attention to Seedling Selection and Protection, Maintaining Density: Careful thinning and retaining seedlings are of great importance to millet growth. Chi Wanku, based on the favorable conditions that the local terrain is high, easy to ventilate and drain, crops will not be damaged by heat, and he has applied a lot of fertilizer, and nutrients will not be depleted, implemented dense planting for both millet and potatoes to avoid yield reduction due to insect pests. When the millet was more than one inch tall, he began the first thinning; three or four days later, he did the second thinning, carefully selecting strong seedlings; the third thinning selected fertile and removed weak seedlings, and began to determine the seedlings (local farmers generally only thin once before determining the seedlings). After the seedlings were determined, he also removed diseased, insect-infested, and malformed weak seedlings at any time to avoid wasting soil fertility. He planted potatoes not only paying attention to selecting buds but also implementing single-bud double-planting (one bud per piece, two pieces per hole) and triangular staggered dense planting, with row spacing of about one foot five inches and plant spacing of one foot to one foot one inch, about 3,800 holes per mu. In this way, there are two plants per hole, which can save the labor of thinning and avoid seedlings growing in clusters and wasting soil fertility.

(V) Rational Fertilization: The row spacing of millet is narrow, making it inconvenient to apply topdressing; however, he can use different methods to apply fertilizer according to the different degrees of fertilizer decomposition to maximize the fertilizer effect. In one piece of land, he applied decomposed summer sheep manure and non-decomposed winter sheep manure. The former has a fast fertilizer effect and is applied in concentrated holes (applied to potato land) for absorption by crop seedlings; the latter is spread all over to avoid brewing heat and damaging young roots, because it decomposes slowly and can be absorbed by crops in the later stage. Because Chi Wanku applied a lot of fertilizer, and the quality was also good, the needs of crop growth throughout the entire period can be fully supplied even without topdressing. His millet usually tillers two to four times, and the millet plants are strong, the ears are large and dense, and the grains are full. Other farmers' millet rarely tillers due to insufficient fertilization.

(VI) Meticulous and Appropriate Irrigation: He grasped the fertilizer-tolerant and water-loving characteristics of the "Dongfang Liang" millet variety. Because the weather was dry and he applied a lot of fertilizer, he boldly irrigated the millet seedlings at an early stage. He irrigated many times, but the amount of each irrigation was small. The first irrigation before spring plowing was only shallow irrigation, so that the temperature of the land would easily rise, without affecting seed germination and fertilizer decomposition. After the millet seedlings were determined, he often checked the growth of the millet seedlings at noon. As soon as the millet seedlings showed slight withering, he immediately irrigated them shallowly. After entering the hot season and during the heading and flowering stages, he irrigated three times separately. He often said, "Irrigation depends on the weather, the land, and the crops." "Crops are like children, give them what they should eat and drink." Because his millet was given a lot of base fertilizer and the water was irrigated in a timely manner, nutrients could be fully supplied from beginning to end, and the growth was particularly robust. This broke the old farming method of "millet seedlings cannot be watered." In addition, he strove for consistency in irrigation depth, leveled the ground very flat, dug several water inlets, and irrigated shallowly in different plots, irrigating from east to west the first time and from west to east the second time, to ensure uniformity. After each irrigation, he used a hoe to loosen the soil once, dividing the soil into upper and lower layers, cutting off the capillaries, and reducing water evaporation. His potatoes were also watered four times in a timely and appropriate amount: the first time was before earthing up, after hoeing twice, when the weather was extremely dry, watering was followed by earthing up, which played a decisive role in avoiding drought. The second time was after entering the hot season, when the temperature was high, the leaf surface evaporated more, the growth was most vigorous, and the underground stems began to form, requiring the most water. At this time, irrigation had the greatest effect on high yield. The third time was at the beginning of flowering, when the underground stems had already expanded. If the rainfall was normal, it was possible not to irrigate, but in 1951, the weather was dry, and the soil drainage was good, so it was still necessary to irrigate shallowly in an appropriate amount. The fourth time was after the flowering was completed and half a month before harvest. According to general custom, it is not advisable to irrigate at this time to prevent rot, but Chi Wanku grasped the climate of that year and the local conditions and still irrigated shallowly in an appropriate amount to make the soil soft so that the underground stems could grow fully. Because he mastered the irrigation principles of multiple times, small amounts, irrigation in different plots, and irrigation along the ridges, he obtained a high yield, which also broke the old habit of ordinary farmers who believed that "potatoes cannot be watered too much, too much watering will cause blight (late blight)."

(VII) Fine Intertillage Management: After sowing, the soil was compacted twice within three days using small stone rollers, going back and forth twice each time, to make the seeds closely adhere to the soil and promote germination. Four days after sowing, there was a rain shower locally. To prevent the soil surface from gelling and hindering the emergence of seedlings, it was compacted again once, going back and forth twice. On the seventh day, the crops generally germinated, evenly and strongly. Five or six days after the seedlings were determined, it was hoed shallowly once with a small hoe, the purpose of which was to remove weeds, loosen the soil, and maintain soil moisture. After the first irrigation, it was hoed deeply once with a large hoe, about one inch or two inches deep, so that the soil between the rows was earthed up beside the roots of the seedlings, promoting root growth. It was hoed shallowly once during the heading stage and again during the peak flowering stage. The last two weedings were both after irrigation, and the purpose of both was to remove weeds, loosen the soil, maintain moisture, and inhibit evaporation. The timing of the above compaction and intertillage weeding and the depth of hoeing were all very appropriate and rational.

(VIII) Prevention and Control of Diseases and Insect Pests: Before sowing millet, he had conducted warm water seed soaking and seed disinfection, so white hair disease was very mild. Local sowing habits are mostly before the beginning of summer; Chi Wanku delayed sowing until after the beginning of summer, thus reducing the harm of heartworm. Every time he did intertillage weeding, he removed and burned diseased and insect-infested plants at any time to prevent spread. In addition to winter sheep manure (which has fewer parasitic diseases and insect pests), spring sheep manure was fully decomposed before application, which also eliminated many insect eggs and disease spores parasitic and lurking in the manure. He paid attention to the formation of potato tubers, discarding any with slight marks; the hole spacing was small, but there were only two plants per hole, so it could ventilate. In addition, the weather was dry this year, so no disease occurred.

III. How to Continue to Improve

After this investigation and understanding, Chi Wanku's high-yield achievements can be affirmed. The farming techniques are generally reasonable, and there are many innovations that are worth promoting widely. However, not being organized and working alone is his biggest shortcoming. In the future, following the path of organizing to develop production, helping each other in production with others, jointly studying technology, and improving farming efficiency will further improve high-yield achievements. There are also areas that need improvement in fertilization and sowing techniques:

(I) Chi Wanku's land has a larger sandy texture, and a large amount of base fertilizer is applied at one time, resulting in a lot of nutrient loss. In the future, attention should be paid to adopting the method of applying fertilizer in stages.

(II) For the convenience of topdressing and to strengthen intertillage and ventilation and light transmission, the row spacing of millet should be appropriately widened before dense planting; this will greatly facilitate intertillage management and increase yield.

(III) The paddy land in Taishizhuang is mostly sandy loam, and Chi Wanku's land has a very moderate sand content; if there is no actual need, excessive sand filling may lead to loss of water and nutrients, and attention should be paid to this.

    察哈尔丰产模范池万库的谷子和马铃薯为什么比当地一般农民的多收三倍
    察哈尔省人民政府农林厅
    察哈尔省地势较高，无霜期短，去年遭受了旱、雹、虫、霜等严重灾害。但是阳高县太师庄劳动模范池万库创造了谷子（粟）每亩产九百二十多斤、马铃薯每亩产七千三百多斤的丰产成绩。为了总结和推广池万库的先进经验，察哈尔省人民政府组织丰产调查团前往太师庄实地调查。参加调查团的有察哈尔省中共各级委员会、各级人民政府及各级农场的干部二十多人。下面是我们调查的结果。
    一、丰产成绩
    池万库共有水地四点七四九亩，旱地六亩。主要丰产成绩是：水地种谷子一点一四九亩，每亩产量九百二十六点八三市斤，为当地农民每亩平均谷子产量（二百二十一市斤）的四点一九倍，为他的地邻张润垣的同品种的谷子每亩产量（二百三十四斤）的三点九六倍；而且谷粒饱满，每市斗重十四市斤（当地一般农民每斗谷子重十三斤到十三斤半）。水地种马铃薯零点三六亩，折合每亩产量达七千三百二十一斤，为当地一般农民每亩马铃薯产量的二倍到四倍。其余水地种马铃薯零点七四亩，因和他的女婿的地相连，共同收获混合储藏，产量已不可考。另水地一点六亩第一季种蚕豆，收三市石；第二季用八分地种烟叶，收获一百二十斤，其余八分地种黄豆以保养地力。另水地零点九亩，第一季种蒜，共收二百八十连（每连四十头）；间作葫萝卜，收获四千斤；旱地种谷子三亩，收获三十五市斗。所有水地旱地各种作物产量，都在当地农民一般产量之上。
    二、丰产原因
    1、从劳动中创造了丰产条件
    （一）改良土壤：池万库的谷地原是三等水地
    （这个村水地共分三等），地势低凹，石砾颇多，土质贫瘠，土层很浅。池万库把地中大块石砾拣起堆放地头，以防洪水冲刷表土，又在地边沿大路旁挖蓄水沟，在另一地头挖一个深大的蓄水池，和蓄水沟相连。大雨以后，上游洪水挟多量泥沙流来，一到水池，流速顿缓，泥沙自然沉积。这种冲积土壤，都是上游表土，风化完全，肥分很大。雨后如果谷地积水过多，池万库就把积水引到蓄水池内，不使肥水流到远处去。冬季把沟、池中积存的泥沙，全部挖起倒入地内。仅去年一冬所倒的淤泥流沙，就有二十多车。这样，蓄水池逐年加深，经过挖泥沙垫地，耕地表土逐年加厚。而且泥沙就在土地近旁，费工不多。池万库的水地经过历年壅填培压，加上大量施肥，深耕细耱，现在土色润黑，含沙适中，不仅肥分甚高，而且结构很好。同村农民张润恒、杨从先的土地，和池万库的土地毗连，但土质粘重，结构坚硬，和池万库的地相比较，相差很大。
    （二）大量积肥，合理施肥：池万库十分注意养羊积粪和利用尿肥。他最初只养羊二只，经历年细心饲养，羊只不断繁殖，近年经常保持二十一只。这些羊的粪便，成为池万库农作物的主要肥料。他的羊粪掺土比例，一般是粪四成、土六成，夏秋时节羊粪较多，可达粪、土各半。（一般农民粪土比例，多是粪三成，土七成；或是粪二成，土八成。）他没事的时候就挎筐拾粪。每见有猪、狗牲畜或人尿痕迹，就连同湿土铲入筐内。他非常注意尿肥，他说：“大家都拾粪，那有许多可拾？大好尿肥，不拾实在可惜。”池万库养羊既多，拾粪又勤，每年积粪至少三十多车，而且肥分很好。土壤经多年施肥，有机质逐年加多，土粒结构逐年提高。以去年而论，各地平均每亩施用上好羊圈粪六车，约合一万一千斤到一万二千斤；马铃薯地三分六厘，施羊圈粪三车，约合五千五百斤到六千斤。单以粪量计算，约为当地一般群众施肥量的三倍到五倍。池万库养羊积肥，极注意羊的饲料。他平常每天给每只羊喂一合黄豆或黑豆；秋收后加喂一些剩下的零碎的马铃薯，和蔬菜的残叶败根。这些有机质物质经过牲畜消化以后，肥分并不减少，且更易腐熟分解，较之用作堆肥，或把黑豆炒熟肥田，更为合算。池万库重视尿肥，也是有道理的，因畜粪都是饲料残滓，富于纤维，作物不易利用，主要效用是增高地温，膨软土壤，增大土壤的保水力和养分吸收力，不如畜尿肥效较速，可供作物直接吸收。以成分而言，尿中氮素较多，钾素更大部分在尿内；以分量而言，人或牲口每天排泄尿量比粪量都多。
    2、从耕地到收获，打破老一套的耕作方法
    （一）注意轮作，决不重茬：池万库土地虽然不多，但水旱地都分为数组，更番轮作。有时种豆科作物以保养并恢复地力；有时种菜且大量施肥以增强养分。他去年种谷子的地，前作是马铃薯，取其收获马铃薯时翻土较深，积存的养分也多；去年种马铃薯的地，前作是谷子，取其谷子根较浅，下层养分还没有被充分利用。但他并非连年谷、薯轮作，主要是看土壤情况，适当地使谷子、马铃薯和豆、菜轮作。这样肥分可以充分发挥，土壤也得到适当恢复保养，同时也能减轻寄生在土壤中的病虫的为害。
    （二）精耕细作：谷地前作是马铃薯。在收获马铃薯时用铁锹挖土，已有深耕之利；又在封冻前深耕一次，不耙不耱，使土块立起，经充分日晒风化，杀灭虫卵和潜伏土内的害虫，且冬季可以积雪，春季可以积沙（因当地地势较高，如耙平了地，雪、沙都易被风刮走）。解冻以后，先耱一次，使土壤疏松碎细，减少水分蒸发；然后用括子推平，使地势平坦，再行灌水。等地稍干，又耙耱
    一次，使土壤空气流通，避免胶结，并且可以充分春晒，播种前先行铺粪，复耕一次，深度较秋耕略浅，以免翻上底土，不利作物生长。接着就耱一次，耙一次，再细耱一次。这样前后翻土三次（连同前作收获时一次），耙、耱共五次，土壤已充分细碎，上下均和，极有利于作物根部的发育伸长。他的马铃薯地，因前作是谷子，所以用铁锹挖地。这样作虽费工略多，但较旧犁耕得更深，而且更均匀。至于耕、耙、耱，都和谷地相同。同是秋耕，因前作情况不同，后作需要不同，或用犁耕，或用锹挖。从这可以看到，他的耕作方法是极其精细周到的。
    （三）细心选种：池万库往年种“白油沙”、
    “齐头白”等谷种，产量不高。一九五一年他掌握了本村可以随时灌溉、历年霜害较他村为迟为轻、自己积肥较多三个有利条件，就到孙人堡村换来耐肥嗜水但生长期较长的丰产品种“东方亮”。品种选定之后，又再三筛簸，除去秕粒。他去秋留种都是穗选，并摘去顶端和基部小穗，只取中部最饱满的部分。至于种马铃薯，他不仅注意选择适当的品种和个体适中的薯块，而且严格地选芽。储藏马铃薯种籽时，他注意窖内维持适当的温度，使薯块微萌嫩芽，而不使发芽过长。据他说：如发芽过长，栽种时容易受伤，幼苗也比较孱弱。在切种时，再逐块选芽，每块只留一芽，其余切去不要。这样发芽可靠，又可避免缺株，而且易于出土，幼苗也特别健壮。
    （四）注意选苗保苗，保持密度：细心间苗留苗，对谷子生长有重大关系。池万库根据当地地势较高，易于通风排水，作物不致热坏，和自己上粪很多、养分不致亏竭的有利条件，谷和马铃薯都实行密植，以避免因虫害而减产。在谷高一寸多时，他开始第一次间苗；三、四天后，再作第二次间苗，细心选留壮苗；第三次间苗选肥去弱，开始定苗（当地一般农民仅间苗一次即行定苗）。定苗以后，并随时拔除病株、虫株及畸形弱苗，以免耗费地力。他种马铃薯除注意选芽外，并实行单芽双植
    （每块一芽，每穴二块）、三角形错综密栽的办法，行距约一尺五寸，株距一尺到一尺一寸，每亩约三千八百穴。这样，每穴都是二株，既可免间苗之劳，也可免幼苗丛生虚耗地力。
    （五）合理施肥：谷子行距较窄，不便施用追肥；但他能根据肥料腐熟程度的不同，分别用不同的方法施肥，发挥肥料效果。在一块地内，他施用腐熟的夏羊粪，也施用未经腐熟的冬羊粪。前者肥效快，集中穴施（施于马铃薯地），供作物幼苗时期吸收；后者则全面铺撒，以免发生酿热，伤及幼根，因分解较慢，可供作物后期吸收。因池万库施肥既多，质量也好，虽不施追肥也可充分供应作物全期生长的需要。他的谷子通常分蘖二到四个，而且谷株健壮，穗大码紧，谷粒饱满。其他农民因施肥不足，谷子很少分蘖。
    （六）细致、适量地灌溉：他掌握了“东方亮”谷种耐肥嗜水的特性，因为天气干旱，自己施肥多，所以就大胆地在谷子幼苗期即行灌水。他灌水次数多，但每次灌量不大。在春耕前第一次灌水只是浅灌，使地的温度容易上升，不致影响种子发芽和肥料的分解。在谷子定苗后，中午就经常检查谷苗生长情况。谷苗微现衰萎，即行浅灌。在入伏以后和抽穗期、开花期，分别灌水三次。他常说：“灌水要看天、看地、看庄稼。”“庄稼像小孩，该吃给吃，该喝给喝。”他的谷子因施基肥较多，水又灌得适时，养分自始至终都可充分供给，生长得特别健壮。这就打破了“谷苗不能浇水”的老一套耕作方法。另外，他灌水务求深浅一致，地整得很平，掘好几个进水口，分畦浅灌，第一次从东向西灌，第二次从西向东灌，以求均匀一致。每次灌水以后，就用锄搂一次，使土壤分成上下两层，割断毛细管，减少水分蒸发。他的马铃薯，也适时适量地浇了四次水：第一次在培土以前，锄二遍以后，这时
    天气奇旱，浇水以后，接着培土，这对于避免旱灾有决定作用。第二次在入伏以后，气温较高，叶面蒸发较盛，生长最旺，地下茎开始形成，需水最多，这时灌水，丰产作用最大。第三次在开始落花时，这时地下茎已经膨大，倘雨量正常可以不灌；但一九五一年天旱，土壤排水现象良好，仍有必要适量浅灌。第四次在落花完了以后、收获前半月灌；按一般习惯，为防腐烂此时不宜灌水，但池万库掌握了这一年的气候和当地的风土，仍适量地浅灌，使土壤膨软，以便地下茎充分长大。因为他掌握了多次、少量、分畦灌、顺垅灌的灌水原则，获得了丰产，也打破了一般农民认为“马铃薯不能多浇，多浇会曝死（疫病）”的旧习惯。
    （七）精细中耕管理：播种后，在三天以内用小石墩镇压二次，每次往返两遍，使种粒和土壤密合，促进发芽。播后四天，当地曾降阵雨，为了防止土面胶着阻碍幼芽出土，又镇压一次，往返二遍。到第七天，作物普遍发芽，又齐又壮。定苗后五、六天，用小锄浅锄一次，目的是除去杂草，疏松土壤，保持土壤水分。第一次灌水以后，用大锄深搂一次，深约一寸多到二寸，使行间土壤壅培在苗株根旁，促进根部生长。抽穗期浅锄一遍，开花盛期又浅锄一遍。最后两次锄草，都在灌溉之后，目的都是除草松土，保持水分，抑制蒸发。以上镇压和中耕除草的时间和锄的深浅都十分适当合理。
    （八）防治病虫害：谷子没有播种以前，他曾进行温汤浸种和种子消毒，所以白发病很轻。当地播种习惯多在立夏以前；池万库延至立夏后播种，因此减少了钻心虫的为害。他每次中耕除草，发现病株虫株，就随时拔除烧去，以免蔓延。除冬羊粪外（这种粪寄生的病虫害较少）、春羊粪都经过充分腐熟，然后施用，也消灭了不少寄生和潜伏在粪内的虫卵和病胞子。他对马铃薯则注意造块，稍有伤痕即行舍弃；穴距小，但每穴仅二株，因之能通风，加以这年天旱，所以病害没有发生。
    三、怎样继续提高一步
    经过这次调查了解，池万库的丰产成绩是可以肯定的。耕作技术一般都合理，并且有不少创造，值得广泛推广。但没有组织起来，一人单干，是他的最大的缺点。今后走组织起来发展生产的道路，和别人一起互助生产，共同研究技术，提高耕作效率，才能把丰产成绩更提高一步。在施肥和播种技术上，也有须要改进的地方：
    （一）池万库的土地沙性较大，大量基肥一次施用，肥分流失颇多，今后应注意采用分期施肥法施肥。
    （二）为了追肥便利，并加强中耕及通风通光效果，谷子宜适当加宽行距再行密栽；这样中耕管理大为方便，产量可以增加。
    （三）太师庄水地多是沙质壤土，池万库的地含沙比例已很适中；如无实际需要，过分填沙，水分养分恐怕会流失，对这一点应加注意。
