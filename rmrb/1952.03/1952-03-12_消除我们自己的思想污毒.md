    Eliminate the Filth and Poison in Our Own Thoughts
    Jin Kemu
    Since the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy was launched in universities and colleges, many distressing and unreasonable phenomena have been exposed. More importantly, the thoughts that produce these phenomena are now becoming increasingly apparent.
    The decadent thoughts of the bourgeoisie and the vile ideas of petty merchants still exist seriously and quite widely in the minds of university and college teachers, albeit in different forms.
    Treating academic work as a commodity and advertising it with various trademarks; everyone claiming to be "the world's best" and "unparalleled globally," with the standards being nothing more than foreign brand names and "imported goods" from capitalist countries like Harvard, Yale, Cambridge, and Oxford; selling knowledge and seeking wide distribution. All of this follows the same path as the behavior of merchants.
    Snatching up new books and magazines from England and America first, engaging in "wholesale and retail," boasting and exaggerating, thinking they have obtained a unique secret; introducing reference books but never mentioning the secret texts they rely on; collecting materials and guarding them from others, treating them as "family secrets." Isn't this "hoarding" and "monopolization"?
    In order to compete for "first place" and become "experts," they delve into unpopular subjects, taking what others discard, and then "buying and selling short," making things "rare and valuable," securely occupying the top spot and "monopolizing the limelight." Isn't this like a great merchant harboring the thought of "profiting from scarce goods"?
    They take pride in having their papers "exported," trying to cater to the tastes of customers in capitalist countries; or they copy and plagiarize extensively, publishing everywhere to promote themselves; their names must be prominently displayed, and they haggle over royalties; they only care about sales and not about the readers.
    Academic research should be like accumulating firewood, with "latecomers surpassing the old"; however, they often conceal the achievements of others while exaggerating their own contributions as original creations; those with the same name are touted as "my teacher" or "my friend," while those with different names are warned against as "imitations"; all the "Wang Mazi" brands are "the only one, with no branches."
    Instead of competing in terms of contributions to the people, they love to listen to "informers" probing the "bottom line" of other brands; thus, some "runners" scurry around, causing other brands to close down while their own brand expands and establishes many branches.
    When boasting about the importance of the courses they teach to students, they must criticize others, and they regard students' career prospects as the main proof of importance; they see students as customers and colleagues as competitors for sales.
    They only care about their own fame and profit, regardless of the teaching results, even using students as experimental subjects or assistants for their own research, forgetting that they are cadres urgently needed by the country. They view the interests of the country and the people through the lens of their own interests, and once public and private interests cannot be reconciled, they do not hesitate to harm the public interest for their own benefit. When old goods are not selling, they sigh and moan, or even stick on labels to pass them off as new goods. The knowledge they have acquired through various schemes is only used as a commodity, and their own brains are only used as warehouses. "Free competition," "dumping," and "withholding sales" have become daily habits, but they do not realize that the world has changed.
    Shouldn't all of this awaken us suddenly under the loud shout of the working class?
    The bourgeoisie uses "sugar-coated bullets" to attack our revolutionary cadres in order to steal state property, while our teachers are controlled by the filth and poison in their own minds and unconsciously use the decadent thoughts of the bourgeoisie to influence the future cadres of the country every day. Can this be tolerated?
    For the sake of our great motherland, cherish our students, cherish ourselves, and quickly eliminate the filth and poison in our own thoughts!

    消除我们自己的思想污毒
    金克木
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动在高等学校展开以后，揭发了不少可痛心的不合理现象，而更重要的是现在已进一步显露出产生这些现象的思想。
    资产阶级的腐朽思想，恶劣的市侩思想，在高等学校教师的头脑中还严重地、相当普遍地存在着，不过采取了不同的形式而已。
    把学术当商品，用种种商标做广告；个个都自命“世界第一”“独步全球”；而标准又无非是哈佛、耶鲁、剑桥、牛津之类的资本主义国家的洋字招牌“舶来品”；贩卖知识，广求销路。这都和商人行为同出一轨。
    抢先把英美新书杂志霸在手中，“零趸批发”，大吹大擂，以为独得之秘；介绍参考书独不介绍自己所依靠的秘本；搜罗材料，唯恐人知，当作
    “家传秘方”。这岂不是“囤积”“独占”？
    为了争“第一”，当“专家”，就钻冷门，人弃我取，然后“买空卖空”，“物稀为贵”，稳坐第一把交椅，“独占鳌头”。这岂不是怀“奇货可居”思想的大贾？
    论文以“出口”为荣，揣摩资本主义国家主顾的脾味；或则东抄西袭，多多益善，四处发表，广作宣传；姓名必须显著刊登，稿费不惜斤斤计较；只顾推销，不管读者。
    学术研究本如积薪，“后来居上”；但是对他人的成果常隐匿不提，而对自己的补充就夸为独创；同一字号便标榜“吾师”、“吾友”，不同字号便声明“谨防假冒”；各种“王麻子”都是“只此一家，别无分店”。
    不是在对人民的贡献上竞赛，却专爱听“耳报神”刺探别家字号“存底”；于是就有一些“跑合”东奔西走，使别家字号关门，本号扩充，广设分店。
    对学生夸自己教的课程重要，就一定要指摘别人，而且把学生的职业出路当做重要性的主要证明；把学生看成顾客，把同事看做竞争销路的同业。
    只顾自己名利，不管教学结果，甚至拿学生当自己研究的实验品或助手，忘了他们是国家迫切需要的干部。看国家人民利益时都要通过自己利益的眼镜，一旦公私不能兼顾，就不惜损公利私。旧货滞销就长吁短叹，甚或乱贴商标，冒充新货出售。费尽种种心机贩来的学问只作为商品，自己的头脑只作为货栈，“自由竞争”、“倾销”、“惜售”，成了日常生活习惯，却不知世界已经换了面目。
    这种种情形还不该在工人阶级大喝一声之下猛醒过来么？
    资产阶级为盗窃国家财产用“糖衣炮弹”攻打我们的革命干部，而我们教师们却被自己头脑中的思想污毒所支配，也不自觉地天天用资产阶级的腐朽思想去影响未来的国家干部。这是可以容许的么？
    为了我们伟大的祖国，珍惜学生，珍惜自己，快些消除我们自己的思想污毒吧！
