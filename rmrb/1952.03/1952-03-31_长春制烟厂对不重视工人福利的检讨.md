    Changchun Cigarette Factory's Self-Criticism for Neglecting Workers' Welfare

    Comrade Editor: We sincerely accept the criticism from reader Tan Yi published in the People's Daily on March 7, criticizing our factory for not paying enough attention to workers' welfare, and we have gradually improved the shortcomings in our work.

    Bureaucratic work style has prevented us from adequately addressing the safety and welfare facilities for our employees. We failed to prioritize needs effectively, leading us to construct dormitories, a primary school, an adult education school, and a nursery before adequately addressing the urgent need for ventilation in the workshops. After September of last year, the destemming group transitioned from manual to machine destemming. Additionally, the tobacco leaves were steamed drier than before. The existing ventilation equipment was insufficient, causing tobacco dust to fill the destemming workshop. We repeatedly requested approval from higher-level leadership organs to install ventilation equipment before and after the Changchun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China inspection team raised its criticism. Because there was no construction plan at the beginning of last year, it was not approved. At the beginning of this year, we submitted a budget for the construction of ventilation equipment in the basic construction plan, and after approval by the leading organs, construction partially began in early March and will be completed in the second quarter.

    The canteen problem is the issue most complained about by employees. The reason for the poor quality of meals is embezzlement by management personnel and staff cooperative personnel. In January, we replaced the embezzlers, re-elected the catering committee, streamlined redundant personnel, and added a small shop. The meals have been gradually improved in March. We thank the readers for their criticism. We guarantee that we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "for every inch of production growth, there should be a corresponding fraction of welfare growth," and do our best to improve employee welfare.

    长春制烟厂对不重视工人福利的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报三月七日刊载了读者谭毅批评我厂不重视工人福利的来信，我们诚恳地接受这个批评，并已逐步改进我们工作中的缺点。
    官僚主义作风使我们没有能够很好地注意职工的安全福利设备。我们没有分清轻重缓急，因而先修建了宿舍、子弟学校、业余学校和托儿所等，却没有把最急需的车间通风设备搞好。去年九月以后，除梗组改手工除梗为机器除梗，又因蒸烟叶较前为干，旧有的一部分通风设备已不够用，以致除梗组的工房里烟土飞扬。在中共长春市委检查组提出批评前后，我们曾一再请示上级领导机关，准予安装通风设备。因为去年年初没有修建计划，所以未被批准。今年初，我们在基本建设计划里提出修建通风设备的预算，经领导机关批准后，三月初已部分动工，第二季度可以完成。
    食堂问题是职工意见最多的问题。伙食办不好的原因是管理人员和职工合作社人员贪污。一月份，我们撤换了贪污分子，改选了伙食委员会，并精简了多余的人员添设了小卖部，三月份伙食已逐步改善。我们感谢读者的批评。我们保证一定按照毛主席指示的“生产长一寸，福利长一分”的精神，尽力做好职工福利工作。
