    World Women Fight to Defend Peace
    International Department of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

    In the increasingly surging worldwide movement to defend peace, women have played an active role. From the painful memories of the Second World War and from the current aggressive war launched by American imperialism in Korea, women of all countries deeply realize that only by actively defending peace, exposing and stopping the imperialist conspiracies and crimes of aggression, can the lives, safety, and happiness of women and children be guaranteed.

    In February 1951, when the First Session of the World Peace Council issued a declaration on concluding a Five-Power Peace Pact, peace-loving women around the world responded enthusiastically and actively fought for this great call. Women accounted for half of the six hundred million signatures worldwide, and a large portion of the signature collectors were women. They used signatures to express their desire and determination for peace and opposition to aggressive wars, thus forming a huge force in the movement to defend peace.

    In the world's women's struggle to defend peace, the women of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, stand at the forefront. They express their determination to defend peace through selfless labor. Soviet women strive to strengthen the construction of the socialist country to consolidate the Soviet Union, the bulwark of world peace. In industry, transportation, and construction, millions of female workers, engineers, and foremen constantly improve their technical knowledge and production techniques, master the highest engineering, and achieve high production standards. Farm women in collective farms and state farms are working hard to increase yields and actively participate in the implementation of Stalin's plan to transform nature. More than 40 percent of agricultural scientists in the Soviet Union are women. The number of women specialists in the Soviet Union with higher education has reached more than 830,000. Soviet women contribute all their strength and wisdom to the cause of building communism and to the cause of protecting world peace.

    Chinese women have made significant contributions to the struggle to defend peace. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Chinese women, together with the people of the whole country, are carrying out a vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. They enthusiastically participate in production, donations, and preferential treatment movements to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Female soldiers in the Chinese People's Volunteers are engaged in medical, artistic, communications, and political work on the Korean front. They are engaged in arduous struggles in different posts, fighting directly against the American imperialist aggressors side by side with the Korean people and women. The just struggle waged by Chinese women and the Chinese people together gives great encouragement and confidence to the people of the world who defend peace, especially the people of Asia. Women in other new democratic countries, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the Mongolian People's Republic, are following the glorious example of Soviet women and successfully building socialism. Their labor achievements play a major role in strengthening the world peace and democracy camp. They are constantly vigilant against the sabotage activities of the imperialists and the Tito clique, and they support the Korean people, who are heroically fighting against the American aggressors to defend world peace, with large quantities of medical equipment and other relief supplies.

    In capitalist countries, the struggle to defend peace is closely linked to the struggle against colonial wars and to demand improved living conditions for the working people. French women resolutely oppose the colonial war waged by French imperialism in Vietnam. They demand the withdrawal of their husbands and sons from the shameful colonial war. The world-renowned French peace warrior Raymonde Dien used the heroic act of lying on the rails to protest the dirty war waged by French colonialists in Vietnam. British women firmly oppose the Malayan war, and they demand that the huge sums spent on expanding armaments and for war be used to improve the lives of the working people and for social welfare.

    American women, especially black women, use gatherings, parades, and sending delegations to the United Nations and Washington to demand an immediate ceasefire in Korea and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the time of the signing of the so-called "Japanese Peace Treaty," female workers, housewives, mothers, professional and religious women in San Francisco formed a committee and brought their children to meet with representatives from various countries, expressing their desire for peace and solidarity with women around the world.

    In colonial and dependent countries, women actively participate in the struggle for national liberation and independence. In the Vietnamese liberation war, more than 700,000 women participated in the guerrillas, and hundreds of thousands of female laborers bravely undertook war service work such as transportation, reconnaissance, and communications. The struggle of African women against racial oppression and discrimination contributes to the overall struggle for peace in the world. In Latin American countries, women actively participate in powerful mass movements to prevent the shameful conspiracies of governments to send troops to Korea.

    German and Japanese women, in order not to be subjected to the brutal ravages of another war, and in order not to allow their husbands and sons to be used as cannon fodder for imperialism, are intensifying their opposition to the rearmament of West Germany and Japan together with the people of the whole country.

    At present, with the growing strength of the world peace and democracy camp and the increasing upsurge of the struggle to defend peace, women all over the world are more closely united around the International Democratic Women's Federation, which has 135 million members in 62 countries, to fight for the defense of peace and the rights and interests of women and children. The struggle of women all over the world to defend peace is unprecedented in the history of the international women's movement in terms of its broad mass character, organization, and activity.

    Recently, the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation, at its meeting in Berlin, resolved to call on women from all countries to actively participate in regional peace conferences in all regions of the world, to actively participate in and prepare for the Third International Women's Congress, and the International Conference for the Defense of Children to be held soon in Vienna. These calls will further strengthen the unity and ties of international women, expand and deepen the world women's peace movement, and bring the peace movement to a new and important stage.

    In the face of the increasingly powerful international women's movement for peace, imperialism is extremely terrified. They have carried out various despicable and shameless persecutions against the heroic female peace fighters of various countries. The former Pleven reactionary government of France falsely accused Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, President of the International Democratic Women's Federation and winner of the 1950 Stalin International Peace Prize, of fabricated crimes. The British government also threatened Mrs. Monica Felton, winner of the 1951 Stalin International Peace Prize, in every possible way, preventing her from telling the British people the truth about the atrocities committed by the American and Rhee gangs she witnessed in Korea. The American occupation authorities in West Germany unreasonably arrested and sentenced Mrs. Wachter, the West German representative of the International Women's Investigation Team to Korea. The Truman government in the United States imprisoned the heroic female peace fighter, Mrs. Annette Doyle.

    But no matter how unreasonably persecuted and frantically prepared for war by imperialism, the will of peace-loving women all over the world is unshakable. For the sake of peace, that is, for the happiness of future generations, they bravely shoulder the important responsibilities entrusted to them by mankind and history, and resolutely fight to defend world peace.

    世界妇女为保卫和平而斗争
    中华全国民主妇女联合会国际部
    在全世界日益高涨的保卫和平运动中，妇女起了积极的作用。各国妇女从第二次世界大战的惨痛回忆里，从目前美帝国主义在朝鲜发动的侵略战争中，她们深深体验到，只有积极起来保卫和平，揭露和制止帝国主义的侵略阴谋和罪行，妇女和儿童的生命、安全与幸福才能得到保障。
    一九五一年二月，当世界和平理事会第一届会议发出了关于缔结五大国和平公约的宣言时，全世界爱好和平的妇女便热烈响应，为这一伟大号召而积极奋斗。在全世界六亿人的签名中，妇女占了一半。而签名的征集者很大一部分是妇女。她们用签名表示要求和平、反对侵略战争的愿望和决心，从而形成了保卫和平运动的一个巨大力量。
    在世界妇女保卫和平的斗争中，伟大的社会主义国家苏联的妇女站在最前列。她们以忘我的劳动表示保卫和平的决心。苏联妇女努力以加强社会主义国家的建设来巩固保护世界和平的堡垒苏联。在工业、运输业和营造业方面，千千万万女工、女工程师和女领班不断提高技术知识和生产技术，掌握了最高的工程学，达到很高的生产标准。集体农庄和国营农场的农妇都在努力提高收获量，积极地参加实现斯大林改造自然计划。全苏联农业学家中有百分之四十以上是妇女。在苏联受过高等教育的妇女专门人材的人数已达八十三万余人。苏联妇女把全部的力量和智慧贡献给建设共产主义事业，贡献给保护世界和平的事业。
    中国妇女对于保卫和平的斗争，曾作了重大贡献。我国妇女在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，正和全国人民一道进行着轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，她们热烈参加生产、捐献、优抚等运动来支援人民志愿军。中国人民志愿军中的女战士，在朝鲜前线从事着医务、文艺、报务、政治等工作，她们在不同岗位上进行着艰巨的斗争，和朝鲜人民与妇女并肩直接打击着美帝国主义侵略者。中国妇女和中国人民在一道所进行的正义斗争，给全世界保卫和平的人民，特别是亚洲人民以极大的鼓舞和信心。其他新民主主义国家波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和蒙古人民共和国的妇女，正遵循着苏联妇女的光辉榜样，胜利地建设社会主义。她们的劳动成果，对于加强世界和平民主阵营起了重大作用。她们时时刻刻警惕着帝国主义和铁托匪帮的破坏活动，并用大批医药器材和其他救济物资支援为反对美国侵略者、保卫世界和平而英勇战斗的朝鲜人民。
    在资本主义国家里，保卫和平的斗争是和反对殖民地战争、要求改善劳动人民的生活条件的斗争密切地联系着。法国妇女坚决反对法帝国主义在越南进行的殖民战争，她们要求从可耻的殖民战争中撤回自己的丈夫和儿子。全世界闻名的法国和平女战士雷蒙达·迪安用卧轨的英勇行动抗议法国殖民者在越南所进行的肮脏的战争。英国妇女则坚决反对马来亚战争，她们要求把扩充军备和用于战争的巨额费用，用于改善劳动人民的生活和社会福利事业上。
    美国妇女，特别是黑人妇女，她们用集会、游行及派遣代表团到联合国和华盛顿去等方式，要求立刻在朝鲜停火，要求和平解决朝鲜问题。在签订所谓“对日和约”时，旧金山的女工、家庭妇女、母亲、职业和宗教界妇女组成委员会，带着孩子去见各国代表，表达了她们要求和平和与全世界妇女团结一致的愿望。
    在殖民地和附属国家里，妇女们积极参加民族解放与独立的斗争。在越南解放战争中，七十多万妇女参加了游击队，几十万女民工勇敢地担任着运输、侦察、通讯等战勤工作。非洲妇女反对种族压迫与歧视的斗争，对于全世界争取和平的总斗争是有所贡献的。在拉丁美洲各国，妇女积极参加强大的群众运动，阻止了各国政府派遣军队到朝鲜去的可耻阴谋。
    德国和日本的妇女，为了不再重受另一次大战的残酷蹂躏，为了不使自己的丈夫和儿子替帝国主义去充当炮灰，她们正和全国人民一道，加紧反对重新武装西德和日本。
    目前，在全世界和平民主阵营的力量日益壮大、保卫和平的斗争日益高涨的情形下，全世界妇女更加紧密地团结在六十二个国家内拥有一亿三千五百万会员的国际民主妇联的周围，为保卫和平、保卫妇女与儿童的权益而斗争。全世界妇女保卫和平的斗争，就其广泛的群众性、组织性和积极性说来，是国际妇女运动史上空前未有的。
    最近，国际民主妇联在柏林召开的执行委员会上，决议号召各国妇女积极参加全世界各地区的区域和平会议，积极参加和筹备第三届国际妇女代表大会，以及即将在维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童会议。这些号召将更加加强国际妇女的团结和联系，使世界妇女保卫和平运动更加扩大和深入，使和平运动走上一个新的重要阶段。
    在越来越强大的国际妇女保卫和平运动面前，帝国主义是万分恐惧的；它们对于各国英勇的和平女战士们，进行了各种卑鄙无耻的迫害。法国前普利文反动政府曾以莫须有的罪名，诬控过国际民主妇联主席、一九五○年“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人戈登夫人。英国政府也曾百般威吓过一九五一年“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人费尔顿夫人，阻挠她把在朝鲜目睹的美李匪军暴行真象告诉英国人民。西德的美国占领当局蛮横无理地将国际妇女赴朝调查团西德代表瓦赫特夫人加以逮捕和判刑。美国杜鲁门政府则把英勇的和平女战士向纳德特·道伊尔夫人投入牢狱。
    但是不论帝国主义如何无理迫害和疯狂备战，全世界妇女爱好和平的意志是不可动摇的。为了和平，也就是为了未来一代的幸福，她们勇敢地肩负起人类和历史赋予她们的重大责任，为保卫世界和平而坚决斗争。
