    Ten. After the first "feeling flight" failure, an idea of "physical unsuitability for flight" arose in her mind. She thought that this flight might be the last one.
    Eleven. However, thanks to the Party's encouragement, she overcame this ideological concern, and made a second flight. This flight was completed very smoothly, which made her extremely happy.
    Twelve. But she vomited again during the third flight, and became ill for two weeks as a result. In bed, she thought that flying was probably impossible. Just as she was feeling sad, leading cadres came to see her, comforted her to rest well, and told her that vomiting at the beginning of flight does not necessarily mean that one is not suitable for flight. Thanks to the care of the leading comrades, she regained her self-confidence.

    十一、但是，由于党对她的鼓励，使她战胜了这种思想上的顾虑，她又作了第二次的飞行。这次的飞行很顺利地完成了，这使她无比的喜悦。
    十二、但在第三次飞行的时候她又呕吐了，并且因此病了两个星期。在病床上，她想，飞行，大概成为不可能的了。正在难过的时候，领导干部来看她，安慰她好好休养，并告诉她在开始飞行的时候，发生呕吐现象不一定就不适于飞行。由于领导同志的关怀，使她又恢复了自信心。
