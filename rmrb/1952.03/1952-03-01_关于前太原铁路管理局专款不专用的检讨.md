    A Self-Criticism Regarding the Former Taiyuan Railway Bureau's Misappropriation of Funds

    To the Editor: The People's Daily published a reader's letter on February 5th criticizing our misappropriation of funds. We now offer the following self-criticism:

    The houses along the lines under the jurisdiction of the former Taiyuan Railway Bureau were almost completely destroyed by the bandit阎匪 [Yán fěi, meaning Yan Xishan's bandit troops] Yan Xishan. During the emergency repairs of the Tongpu Railway in 1949, we built temporary station buildings at various stations along the line to meet the urgent needs of traffic. In 1950, after the formal station buildings were completed, we allocated the temporary station buildings to public security personnel for residence. In the same year, the state approved a grant of seven million jin of rice to solve the housing problem for public security personnel. Due to the needs at the time, we allocated 1.5 million jin of rice to the Shijiazhuang Branch Bureau to build houses for public security personnel along the line, and the remainder was allocated to the Taiyuan Branch Bureau and the Public Security Department. However, we believed that the Public Security Department should not build too many houses, so we deducted one million jin of rice from the funds allocated to the Public Security Department. Later, we agreed to the request of the Taiyuan Branch Bureau and allocated these funds to them to build an auditorium, which is inconsistent with the state's financial system of dedicated funds for specific purposes. We only took care of the needs of the staff of the Taiyuan Branch Bureau and ignored the state's financial system, which is a matter for deep self-criticism. Last year, we submitted the final accounts for the seven million jin of rice to the Ministry of Railways. The phenomenon of waste in construction at the former Taiyuan Railway Bureau was also very serious. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, I personally and related personnel have made self-criticisms, and some are still making self-criticisms. We are prepared to submit the results of our self-criticisms to the Ministry of Railways and relevant higher authorities for review.

### 关于前太原铁路管理局专款不专用的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    关于前太原铁路管理局专款不专用的检讨
    编辑同志：二月五日人民日报发表了读者的来信，批评我们专款不专用。现在我们检讨如下：
    前太原铁路管理局所辖沿线房子，因被阎匪锡山破坏，解放时几乎全部没有了。一九四九年抢修同蒲路，为了行车上的急需，我们在沿线各站都盖了临时站房。一九五○年正式站房盖好，我们即把临时站房拨归公安人员居住。同年，国家批准给我们七百万斤米，以解决公安人员房子问题。由于当时需要，我们分配给石家庄分局一百五十万斤米，盖沿线公安人员房子，其余拨给太原分局和公安处。但我们认为公安处不应盖太多房子，就从拨给公安处的款子里面扣下一百万斤米。之后，我们答应了太原分局的请求，把这些款子拨给他们盖大礼堂，这和国家的专款专用的财政制度是不符合的。我们只照顾了太原分局职工的需要，而忽视了国家的财政制度，是应该深刻检讨的。去年，我们已把七百万斤米的款项的决算呈报了铁道部。前太原铁路管理局在建筑方面的浪费现象也是很严重的，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我个人和有关人员有的已作了检讨，有的正在检讨。我们准备将检讨结果报铁道部及有关上级审查。
    前太原铁路管理局副局长  王效斌
