    Many Illegal Capitalists in East China Have Committed Serious Crimes
    Rampantly Stealing Military Supplies and Endangering National Defense Construction
    People in Various Regions Have Thoroughly Exposed Them, and Those Who Refuse to Confess Will Be Severely Punished
    In the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence in East China, many serious facts have been revealed about illegal capitalists launching frenzied attacks on the People's Liberation Army troops and endangering national defense construction.
    As early as 1949, not long after the complete liberation of mainland East China, the attacks of illegal capitalists on the People's Liberation Army troops began. In 1950, in order to successfully complete the battle to liberate the Zhoushan Islands, the Logistics Department of the East China Military Region ordered a large number of military supplies from private factories in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. These illegal capitalists took the opportunity to massively cut corners, steal state property, and manufacture military supplies that mostly did not meet specifications, causing the People's Liberation Army troops to encounter many avoidable difficulties in carrying out the task of liberating the Zhoushan Islands. For example, the Shanghai profiteer Zhao Jinfeng and others sold anchor ropes for ships to a certain unit, which were made of white coir on the surface but rotten hemp inside. A certain unit was delayed in landing during the cross-sea battle because the anchor rope broke, and some ships were swept away by the waves because the anchor ropes broke. (See page 2 of this newspaper on February 25 for details.) Gu Tonggao, the manager of the Gu Yongxing Sawmill in Nanjing, used damp wooden boards to make ammunition boxes for a certain artillery unit. The ammunition packed in these wooden boxes became damp and ineffective after being transported to the Zhoushan front, not only causing a loss of more than 30 billion yuan in state property, but also directly affecting the war to liberate Zhoushan. Gu Bingrui, the owner of the Shanghai Yide Rubber Factory, drastically cut corners when contracting to produce a batch of single-sided raincoat cloth and life-saving bags for a certain unit for cross-sea operations. The contract stipulated that the rubber content of each piece of raincoat cloth should be 55 percent, but he only used 33 percent; the contract stipulated that each piece of cloth should use 2.5 gallons of gasoline, but he only used 0.95 gallons. The total price of this batch of single-sided raincoat cloth was more than 700 million yuan, and the raw materials, gasoline, and other illegal profits he stole amounted to more than 427 million yuan. His theft in the production of life-saving bags was even more egregious. Life-saving bags are special military supplies that protect the lives of soldiers and ensure the victory of battles in cross-sea operations. All important raw materials were supplied by the unit. In order to steal and replace good raw materials in large quantities, the profiteer Gu Bingrui conducted nine consecutive experiments on stealing and replacing methods. As a result, he stole a large amount of rubber and valuable raw materials, and the life-saving bags produced were not only mostly substandard, but also 15 percent were completely unusable.
    When contracting for certain projects related to national defense, illegal capitalists did not abandon their evil intentions of cutting corners and obtaining exorbitant profits. Huang Junliang, the owner of the Huang Liangji Construction Factory in Nanjing, contracted to repair the barracks of a certain unit. The contract stipulated that 40 sheets of galvanized iron should be used to repair the roof. He found that the roof originally had two layers of galvanized iron, one layer was damaged and the other was still good, so he did not repair it at all, but simply removed the damaged layer. The contract stipulated that the wood and bricks used for the project should be provided by him, but he dismantled and patched up the barracks, and did not provide anything himself. The floor in one building was moldy and rotten. According to the contract, 200 square meters of white pine boards should be replaced. He saw that the floor below was cement, so he simply removed the old floor and reassembled and laid it without adding any new wooden boards. The cost of this repair project was 60 million yuan, but the profiteer Huang Junliang cheated and stole, making a profit of 140 million yuan, more than twice the total project cost.
    Not only that, but illegal capitalists also infiltrated certain military departments to steal information related to national defense construction. For example, Qin Zijun, the manager of the private Minghua Brick and Tile Factory in Nanjing, pretended to be progressive after liberation and infiltrated the East China Military Region Logistics Department Construction General Factory, serving as the head of the materials section. Taking advantage of the factory's need for personnel, he successively introduced more than 30 private merchants and classmates into the factory, forming a theft group. They stole information about national defense engineering construction, colluded with private merchants outside, contracted for projects, raised bid prices, and stole state property on a large scale. In more than a year, the total losses suffered by the factory amounted to more than 30 billion yuan. Many construction factories stole engineering drawings through their informants when contracting for military projects. In this movement, more than 20 stolen engineering drawings were found in only two construction factories in Nanjing. These facts show how serious the attacks of illegal capitalists on the People's Liberation Army troops have become in the past three years. In this movement, these crimes of illegal capitalists have been exposed one by one, and those whose crimes are serious and who refuse to confess will be severely punished by the people.

### 华东各地许多违法资本家罪恶严重  猖狂盗窃军需物资危害国防建设  各地人民已予以彻底揭发，拒不坦白者将受到严厉制裁

    华东各地许多违法资本家罪恶严重
    猖狂盗窃军需物资危害国防建设
    各地人民已予以彻底揭发，拒不坦白者将受到严厉制裁
    华东各地在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动中揭发了许多违法资本家向人民解放军部队猖狂进攻和危害国防建设的严重事实。
    还在一九四九年华东大陆全部解放不久，违法资本家向人民解放军部队的进攻就开始了。一九五○年，为了胜利完成解放舟山群岛的战役，华东军区后勤部曾向上海、南京等地私营厂商订购了大批军需物资，这些违法资本家竟乘机大量偷工减料，盗窃国家财产，制成的军需用品大部不合规格，使人民解放军部队在执行解放舟山群岛的任务中，遇到了许多原可避免的困难。例如：上海奸商赵金峰等卖给某部航船用的锚绳，表面是白洋棕，里面却是烂麻皮，某部在渡海作战时就是因为锚绳断了而延误了登陆时间，而且还有一些船只因为锚绳折断被海浪卷走。（详情见二月二十五日本报第二版）南京谷永兴锯木厂经理谷同高用潮湿的木板替某炮兵部队制造炮弹箱，装在这种木箱里面的炮弹运到舟山前线后，全部受潮失去效用，不仅使国家财产损失了三百多亿元，而且直接影响了解放舟山的战争。上海一德橡胶厂老板顾炳瑞在承制某部渡海作战用的单胶雨衣布和救生袋各一批时，大肆偷工减料。合同规定每匹雨衣布含胶量应为百分之五十五，但是他只用了百分之三十三；合同规定每匹布所用的汽油应为二点五加仑，但是他只用了零点九五加仑；这笔单胶雨衣布的全部定价是七亿多元，而他偷盗去的原料、汽油和其他非法利润就达四亿二千七百多万元。他在承制救生袋中的盗窃行为更加恶劣。救生袋是渡海作战中保护战士生命，保证战役胜利的特种军需品，重要原料都由该部供给，奸商顾炳瑞为了大量偷换好原料，曾连续九次试验偷换方法，结果他盗窃了大批橡胶和贵重原料，做成的救生袋不仅大部是次货，而且有百分之十五根本不能用。
    违法资本家在承包某些和国防有关的工程时，也不放弃他们偷工减料获取暴利的罪恶念头。南京黄亮记营造厂老板黄君亮承修某部营房，合同规定用四十张白铁皮修补房顶，他发现房顶本来有两层白铁皮，一层已坏，一层还好，于是他根本不加修补，只把一层坏的拆下来了事。合同规定工程所用的木料、砖头都由他出，可是他在营房内拆东补西，自己一点也没有出。有一幢房子里的地板已经霉坏，照合同应补二百方白松板，他一看下面是洋灰地，于是就将旧地板拆掉重新拼凑铺上，根本不添什么新木板。这个修理工程的费用为六千万元，可是奸商黄君亮连骗带偷，共获利一亿四千万元，比全部工程费还多出一倍有余。
    不仅如此，违法资本家还打入某些军事部门，盗窃有关国防建设的情报。例如南京私营明华砖瓦厂经理秦子隽在解放后伪装进步，混入华东军区后勤部营建总厂担任材料室主任的要职。他利用该厂需要人员的机会，先后将三十多个私商、同学引进该厂，组成了一个盗窃集团。他们偷窃有关国防工程建设的情报，和外面的私商互相串通，包揽工程，哄抬标价，大规模地盗窃国家财产，一年多来使该厂所受的损失总数达三百亿元以上。许多营造厂在承建军事工程时通过他们的坐探偷盗工程图样，在这次运动中，仅从南京两家营造厂中就查出了偷去的工程图样二十多份。这些事实说明三年来违法资本家向人民解放军部队的进攻已到了多么严重的程度。在这次运动中，违法资本家的这些罪行被一一揭发出来，其中罪行重大而又拒不坦白者将受到人民的严厉制裁。（新华社）
