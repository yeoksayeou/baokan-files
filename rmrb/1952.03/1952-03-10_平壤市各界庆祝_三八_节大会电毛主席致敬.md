Respected Chairman Mao Zedong:

　　Today, the women of Korea, amidst the fierce battles of the Fatherland Liberation War, greet "March 8th" International Women's Day, a day of friendship and solidarity for peace-loving women around the world who oppose aggression and defend peace. We would like to extend our warm gratitude and respect to you, the great leader of the Chinese people, the sincere helper of our Fatherland Liberation War, and to all the Chinese people.

　　We, the women of Korea, together with all the Korean people, are overcoming all difficulties, fully supporting the heroic Korean People's Army and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers, and effectively thwarting the vicious aggression attempts of the American aggressors against our country. The friendship and solidarity between the women of Korea and China has been further consolidated in the Korean Liberation War against the common enemy of the people of Korea and China - the American imperialist aggressors. The great power of this friendship and solidarity will enable us to achieve final victory in the sacred struggle for the freedom and independence of Korea and for lasting world peace.

　　Peace-loving women all over the world sympathize with and support us, the Korean women, in their opposition to the warmongers of American and British imperialism for world peace and the rights of women, as well as the happy future of children. We believe that we will surely win the victory. We are determined to further strengthen the international friendship and solidarity with the great Soviet women, Chinese women, and peace-loving women all over the world. For the common victory of the people of Korea and China and the unlimited prosperity of the People's Republic of China, and for the rights of women and the happy future of our children, we wish you longevity.
