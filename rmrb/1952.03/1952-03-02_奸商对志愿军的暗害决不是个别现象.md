The exposure of the heinous crimes committed by Wuhan merchant Li Yinting, Shanghai merchant Wang Kangnian, and others, who stole the assets of the people to support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and harmed the Volunteer Army, has aroused extreme anger among the people of the whole country. People from all walks of life are demanding severe punishment for these unscrupulous merchants. However, some people think: are such incidents just isolated and accidental? Although the bourgeoisie has a profit-seeking side, they are also Chinese and have also been oppressed by imperialism. So, there probably aren't many capitalists who can do such evil deeds, right?

Indeed, compared with the people of the whole country who love the motherland and enthusiastically support the Volunteer Army, the treacherous merchants who harmed the Volunteer Army are only an insignificant minority. But as far as the bourgeoisie is concerned, this kind of incident is by no means an isolated or accidental phenomenon, but one with universality. Judging from the facts that have continued to be revealed in large numbers recently, from Andong, Shenyang, Jinzhou, Tangshan, Tianjin, Beijing, Taiyuan, Baoding, Dezhou, Jinan, Kaifeng, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuhan all the way to Xi'an and Xining, such things have happened in almost every place that has had economic dealings with the Volunteer Army. In the process of capitalists undertaking the production of gun belts, saddles, tents, hoes, clothing, dry food, non-staple food for the Volunteer Army, repairing vehicles for the Volunteer Army, building rear hospitals, and selling medicines and other supplies to the Volunteer Army, there was almost no item that wasn't tampered with. Some treacherous merchants even stole the passports of the Volunteer Army and sent people to Korea to directly steal vehicles and other supplies of the Volunteer Army.

What is even more noteworthy is that when illegal capitalists in many places were engaged in such evil deeds, many companies openly united, organized, and carried them out on a large scale. For example, in February of last year, the representatives of Tianjin Machinery Industry United Manufacturing Factory and the representatives of United Foundry Factory, etc., accepted a batch of iron pickaxes and shovels ordered by the people to support the Volunteer Army and distributed them to more than forty iron factories for production. Yan Hongzhang, manager of the leading Yuxing Machinery Iron Factory, dared to hide the samples and took out products of extremely poor quality and non-standard specifications as models for each factory to produce. He also said: "Don't worry about the original samples, don't let the receiving personnel know that there are samples sent, everyone should do it according to mine, I guarantee it can be delivered." This group of treacherous merchants, on the one hand, cut corners, and on the other hand, set up traps to corrupt the receiving personnel, and at the same time, they clamored to the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Federation of Industry and Commerce: "The specifications are too strict" and "The inspection personnel are deliberately making things difficult." In this way, they stole 2 billion yuan of the people's assets, and many of the shovels and hoes produced were completely unusable. For example, in Tianjin's textile and dyeing industry and machinery industry, the huge case of stealing 16 billion yuan by cutting corners and other methods when processing a batch of canvas tents and car and carriage covers for the Volunteer Army was also done jointly by more than 140 dyeing and weaving manufacturers and a number of machine factories.

Among this group of treacherous merchants who made a fortune from the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, many were leaders of the bourgeoisie in a certain place or a certain industry. For example, Yang Yilin, the former chairman of the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and Li Shifang, the current vice chairman, together with more than 20 pharmaceutical factories, greatly reduced the main raw materials in the "drinking water disinfectant tablets" produced for the Volunteer Army, resulting in a large number of tablets having no disinfection effect and unable to kill bacteria in the drinking water. Zhang Yinting, a member of the executive committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce and director of the Machinery Manufacturing Industry Association, cut corners in a big way when undertaking the production of 300 military ambulance carts for the Volunteer Army, and some of the carts broke down as soon as they were pushed from the factory to the warehouse. Shen Anqing, director of the Kaifeng Federation of Industry and Commerce, together with fifteen large soy sauce gardens, stole a large amount of beans and various seasonings when processing and manufacturing spiced soybeans for the Volunteer Army. Zhao Zhangji, vice chairman of the Wuxi Federation of Industry and Commerce, stole grain in support of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Qian Qinghe and Yang Shenglin, the director and deputy director of the Xining Federation of Industry and Commerce, extracted exorbitant profits of 150 million yuan from processing 40,000 catties of beef jerky for the Volunteer Army, and some of the meat jerky produced tasted bitter and could not be eaten. Song Keren, vice chairman of the Nanjing Automobile Repair Industry Association, after stealing information that a batch of automobiles supporting the Volunteer Army urgently needed repair, summoned members of the industry association to a meeting to discuss raising repair costs and cutting corners. Zhang Shuchun, a member of the preparatory committee of the Zhenjiang Federation of Industry and Commerce and director of the Timber Industry Association, contracted to build a rear hospital for the Volunteer Army at a certain place, which collapsed less than two months after completion, killing and injuring seven Volunteer Army convalescents.

When the Volunteer Army was fighting bravely on the front lines in Korea and the people of the whole country were enthusiastically supporting the front lines, illegal capitalists, on the one hand, echoed the call for Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea with the people of the whole country, and on the other hand, tried every means to figure out how to take the opportunity to seize greater profits. They shamelessly said: "The army's warehouse doesn't store goods, they are in a hurry to use them as soon as they buy them, they can't bother to inspect, they have to take even if the goods are a little bit bad." "The weather is cold on the front line, they are in a hurry to wear clothes, so just be perfunctory and see if they want it!" "Korea is far away, it doesn't matter, they won't be able to find me." They believe that doing business with the Volunteer Army is the best opportunity to make bloody money.

Illegal capitalists are so vicious and so shameless! For the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, for the success of the country's construction, let us resolutely act and repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks!

    奸商对志愿军的暗害决不是个别现象
    李高
    武汉奸商李寅廷、上海奸商王康年等盗窃祖国人民支援抗美援朝战争的资财、暗害志愿军的罪恶事实被揭发以后，引起了全国人民的极度愤怒。各阶层人民都要求严厉惩办这些丧心病狂的奸商。但是，也有一些人这样想：这种事件只是个别的、偶然的吧？资产阶级固然有唯利是图的一面，但他们也是中国人，也受过帝国主义的压迫，所以，能够干出这种罪恶勾当的资本家总也不会很多吧？
    诚然，和热爱祖国、热烈支援志愿军的全国人民比起来，暗害志愿军的奸商只是微不足道的一小撮。可是就资产阶级来说，这种事件却绝对不是个别的、偶然的现象，而是带有普遍性的。从最近继续大量揭发出来的事实看，从安东、沈阳、锦州、唐山、天津、北京、太原、保定、德州、济南、开封、南京、镇江、无锡、苏州、上海、杭州、武汉一直到西安、西宁，凡是和志愿军有过经济来往的地方，几乎都发生了这类事情。资本家们在承制志愿军的枪皮带、马鞍、帐篷、锹镐、被服、干粮、副食品，给志愿军修理车辆，承建后方医院，向志愿军售卖药品和其他物资中，几乎没有一项不搞鬼。有的奸商甚至盗取志愿军的护照，派人到朝鲜去直接盗窃志愿军的车辆和其他物资。
    更值得注意的，是许多地方的违法资本家在干这种罪恶勾当时，竟是许多家公开地联合起来，有组织地大规模来做。例如去年二月间，天津市机器业联合制造厂代表和联合铸造厂代表等，接受了一批祖国人民支援志愿军的洋镐铁锹定货后，就分配在内部四十多家铁工厂承做。为首的钰兴机器铁工厂经理阎宏彰，竟胆敢把样品藏起来，而拿出质量极坏又不合规格的出品作为各厂生产的样子。并且说：“原来货样不要管它，不要让接收人员知道有发来的货样，大家就按我这个做，我保证交得上。”这伙奸商一面偷工减料，一面布置腐蚀接收人员的圈套，同时又向工商局、工商联合会大肆叫嚣：“规格太严”，“验收人员刁难”。就这样，他们前后盗窃了人民的资财二十亿元，制出来的锹镐有许多根本不能使用。又如天津市织染业和机器业在加工承做志愿军的一批帆布帐篷和汽车马车盖布时，以偷工减料等办法盗窃一百六十亿元的巨案，也是一百四十多家染织厂商和一批机器工厂联合干的。
    在这批大发抗美援朝财的奸商里面，有许多是某一地方、某一行业的资产阶级领导人物。例如天津市制药业同业公会前任主任委员杨益林、现任副主任委员李世芳，曾率同二十多家制药厂，在给志愿军承制“饮水消毒片”时，大量偷减药片中的主要原料，以致大批药片没有消毒效能，不能杀死饮水中的细菌。北京市工商业联合会执行委员、机器制造业同业公会主任委员张荫庭，在承做三百辆志愿军军用担架车时，大肆偷工减料，有的车子从厂房推到仓库就坏了。开封市工商联主任委员沈安卿，率同十五户大酱园，在给志愿军加工制造五香酱豆中，大量偷窃豆子和各种佐料。无锡市工商联副主任委员赵章吉，盗窃支援抗美援朝的粮食。西宁市工商联正副主任骞清和、杨生霖，从给志愿军制造四万斤牛肉干的加工中盗取暴利一亿五千万元，制出的肉干有的味苦不能吃。南京汽车修理业同业公会副主任委员宋克任，盗窃到有一批支援志愿军的汽车急需修理的情报后，竟召集同业公会委员开会，商同抬高修理费和偷工减料。镇江市工商联筹备委员、木业同业公会主任张树春，承建某处志愿军的后方医院，完工后不到两个月就坍塌，压死压伤志愿军休养员七人。
    当志愿军在朝鲜前线英勇作战、全国人民在热烈支援前线的时候，违法资本家们一方面跟着全国人民口喊抗美援朝，另一方面却千方百计在打算如何利用机会来攫取更大的暴利。他们无耻地说：“部队库里不存货，一买就用得急，顾不得验，货再坏一点他们也得要。”“前方天气冷，急着穿衣服，就这样马马虎虎，看他们要不要！”“朝鲜路远，没关系，找不到我头上来。”他们认为和志愿军做生意是发血腥财的最好机会。
    违法资本家就是这样的恶毒，这样的无耻！为了抗美援朝的胜利，为了祖国建设的成功，大家坚决地行动起来，打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻！
