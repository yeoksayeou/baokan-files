The anti-corruption struggle in a machinery factory under the Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau is well integrated with production. So far, it has achieved considerable success on the anti-corruption front, trained a group of "tiger-beating heroes," promoted a number of worker cadres, and greatly raised workers' awareness. On the production front, production tasks for January and February were completed ahead of schedule, and product quality has also improved significantly. For example, in December last year, first-class products accounted for 15.9 percent and third-class products accounted for 11.3 percent; in January this year, first-class products accounted for 62 percent, and third-class products were eliminated; in February, first-class products accounted for more than 98 percent, and third-class products were eliminated.

After the start of the anti-corruption movement, under the unified leadership of the Party organization, the factory unified its thinking and implemented a clear division of labor. The Party General Branch Secretary, the First Factory Director, the Chairman of the Trade Union, the Secretary of the Youth League General Branch, and outstanding cadres and employees were selected to form a thrift and inspection committee, under which was established a "tiger-beating team." In each workshop, shock groups were organized (later changed to investigation and research groups) to investigate clues about corrupt elements. The Second Factory Director and the Production Committee of the Trade Union, along with the Propaganda Committee of the Party and Youth League General Branches, were responsible for leading production. Cadres directly leading production in the workshops were not transferred. The administration and Party organization called on all employees to devote two hours of their spare time each day to participate in the anti-corruption struggle, advancing on two fronts.

Overcoming Right-Leaning Thoughts, Relying Closely on Workers

Before the Spring Festival, the factory's anti-corruption struggle was fully launched, but the workers were not very enthusiastic. The reasons were: some workers had taken small advantages of public property and did not understand the policy, so they only criticized themselves and dared not expose others; some workers saw that there were unclean elements and bureaucratic elements in the "tiger-beating" organization, doubted the leadership's determination, and feared that if they reported now, they would "wear small shoes" in the future. The leadership understood these ideological situations and immediately announced: those who have minor problems of not distinguishing between public and private property only need to not commit them again in the future. The factory and workshop leaders all made self-criticisms and called on the masses to report confidentially. Then, a cadres' meeting was convened, with worker representatives from the workshops participating, and democratic elections were held at the meeting to remove people suspected and dissatisfied by the masses from the "tiger-beating team," purifying and expanding the "tiger-beating" organization in a timely manner. Those elected were mostly outstanding employees who were supported and trusted by the masses. They had long seniority, high prestige, were familiar with the factory's history, and were brave and resourceful. On February 3, the factory held its first struggle meeting. However, because the workers were not yet familiar with the situation, the meeting was not well conducted; some staff and workers thought it was "leftist" and that "if there's nothing, then let it be, why force it?" Right-leaning thoughts arose. In fact, it wasn't that there were no problems, but that the method was wrong. Therefore, the leadership organized the masses again to re-investigate the tool warehouse. During the investigation, workers found many unrecorded materials from the ceiling, floor, and corners, and discovered a series of corruption tricks in the accounts, such as reporting small amounts as large amounts, reporting fewer items than actual, changing product names, and issuing fake invoices. At the same time, it was also found that the major corrupt official, Yu Chuntai, had stolen eight state-owned machine tools when the factory was built in 1949. The leadership fully grasped the materials and held a struggle meeting again on February 10, using facts to educate employees and overcome right-leaning thoughts. The leadership also encouraged workers to boldly suspect and follow up. After the meeting, the pattern shop workers immediately responded to the call, proposing: "We make patterns, if we can't finish, we contract it out. Is there no problem here?" "Why was the opinion given to the team leader erased? There must be a problem!" The leadership analyzed the situation and further mobilized the workers to accuse. As a result, it was found that Yu Dechun was a major corrupt official; he wanted to squeeze out good skilled workers so that the factory's work couldn't be finished, in order to contract it out to private merchants and embezzle money from it.

Organizing the Worker Masses to Participate in the Anti-Corruption Struggle

In addition to selecting outstanding workers to specifically carry out the anti-corruption struggle, this factory, under the policy of combining the anti-corruption struggle with production, organized workshop masses to participate in the anti-corruption struggle outside of production time. The methods are:

(1) The office of the Thrift and Inspection Committee printed and distributed the corrupt officials' corruption materials and clues to the workshops for workers to discuss, in order to mobilize workers to investigate. The workshops organized investigation and research groups to carry out mass investigation and research work. Workers were very willing to accept this task, and after work, they went out to find clues and relationships. Worker Hao Jingbo believed that the General Affairs Section and Jianhua Printing House often had dealings, and there might be problems, so he mobilized his cousin who worked as a counter clerk in Jianhua to expose the printing house manager's bribery and the General Affairs Section's Xiong Fengrong's theft of state property.

(2) Holding forums for veteran workers. Any questions raised by the masses and problems that the leadership couldn't figure out were solved by holding forums for veteran workers. For example, a material requisition slip stated: the repair department received 20 drill bits of 17.5 mm, but after checking with the veteran workers, it was confirmed that this material requisition slip had been modified by the material warehouse, and the repair department had only received one or two.

(3) Without affecting production, worker representatives were often sent to participate in small-scale struggle meetings. In addition, after the leading cadres grasped the materials, they first conducted struggles in their own departments (with representatives from other departments participating); if the corrupt elements were unwilling to thoroughly confess their problems, they would hold large-scale struggle meetings with the participation of all factory employees in a prepared manner. They used Sundays to hold large-scale struggle meetings. In this way, the materials were sufficient (prepared for a week), the time was long, and all workers could participate. The rich materials investigated by the masses and their tremendous pressure at the struggle meetings made the corrupt elements tremble with fear, feeling that the problems could not be kept secret, denied, or escaped, and thus they bowed their heads and confessed their crimes.

Timely Revision of Patriotic Pacts, Launching Production Competitions Combined with "Tiger Beating"

At the beginning of the movement, the employees were very enthusiastic and reported a lot of materials about corrupt elements. However, as the movement deepened, the workers felt that the facts they knew had been reported, and there was nothing to do, so their enthusiasm gradually declined. At the same time, as the movement deepened, the major corrupt officials became more cunning. Therefore, how to continue to mobilize the masses became an urgent problem to be solved. The way this factory solved this problem was to revise the patriotic pact and launch a production competition combined with anti-corruption. They convened a meeting of trade union chairmen, production committee members, and cultural and educational committee members from various workshops to specifically discuss how to revise the patriotic pact. Everyone unanimously decided that the basic content of the new pact should include five aspects:

(1) Actively participate in the anti-corruption struggle and eliminate all corrupt elements; (2) Ensure the completion of production tasks; (3) Solve the key problems existing in the workshop and group; (4) Strengthen the four-prevention work of fire prevention, anti-espionage, anti-theft, and air defense; (5) Actively participate in political study and strive to promote advanced production experience. Then, the leadership mobilized various workshops and groups to conduct discussions. During the workers' discussions, the leadership repeatedly conducted propaganda and education and specific guidance to the workers, so that the revised patriotic pacts all had clear central content.

After the workers revised the patriotic pact, their political enthusiasm immediately rose. Various workshops launched challenges and responses to realize the patriotic pact. In addition to actively investigating the materials of corrupt elements in the factory, many workers also raised the problems of other public factories that they knew about. Gao Guangzhen, the creator of the multi-tool multi-blade cutting method, used to work in the Rongjun Machinery Factory. After work, he went to find the workers who used to work with him to investigate the fact that the Rongjun Machinery Factory director was lured by unscrupulous merchants to jointly steal state timber, copper, and iron. In terms of production, the workers all strived to produce according to the goals stipulated in the patriotic pact. For example, foundry worker Ma Baozhi's output in February exceeded the task by 20 percent without producing any defective products. The most backward parts workshop in the past also continuously discovered five ways to improve production in this movement.

After the workers completed the February production task ahead of schedule, according to the March production plan, they revised the patriotic pact again, in which the standards for output and quality were higher than those in February. In order to ensure the realization of this standard, systems such as checking the implementation of the patriotic pact every Saturday were also stipulated.

Timely Promotion of Cadres from Workers and Revision of Systems

With the improvement of workers' awareness and the removal of corrupt officials, the leadership boldly and promptly promoted activists in the struggle to serve as acting section chiefs, section heads, and other positions; and assigned special personnel to help them become familiar with the business, so that they quickly learned the business work. Therefore, the supply of materials was guaranteed. This broke some people's past wrong views. In the past, some employees always thought that "managing materials is just looking at big piles, there's nothing to it," and that "having one person to do the material work is enough, putting capable people there is a waste." In this movement, they personally saw the harm of corrupt elements to the country, and discovered that the corrupt officials who stole more than 10,500 tons of grain from the fruits of increasing production and practicing economy were Liu Chengyou and others who usually thought "there's nothing to it" in managing materials. They deeply realized the importance of material supply work. Therefore, when the leadership proposed to select a group of people to work in the material department, all the employees in the factory actively and happily recommended the best workers in the workshop. The selected workers also said: "The leadership has placed us in such important positions, we guarantee to do the work well." The workers said: "We can no longer let corrupt elements occupy production management departments." "Doing this means that our working class is the master of the house!" In order to further strengthen the leading role in production, the leadership is still continuing to prepare to promote a large number of outstanding workers as cadres. At the same time, through checking accounts, not only were "tiger dens" found, warehouses were cleared, and chaotic accounts were corrected, but also a series of systems such as timed material requisition, issuance, reimbursement, acceptance, inventory, and safety responsibility were revised. These systems were all revised with the direct participation and active demands of the workers, and they have a broad mass base, so the masses can consciously abide by them.

Workers' Class Consciousness and Production Enthusiasm are Increased

In the anti-corruption struggle, the workers more clearly recognized the ugly face of the bourgeoisie and its despicable means, their class consciousness was improved, and their production enthusiasm was high, thus completing the production task ahead of schedule. For example: the pattern shop and parts shop, which often failed to complete tasks in the past and were called backward workshops, completed their tasks five days ahead of schedule in February due to the increased awareness of the workers. A certain group in the fitter shop drew out four technicians to "beat tigers," but the task was still completed five days ahead of schedule. Three machining workshops have universally promoted advanced rapid cutting methods, and production efficiency has increased by more than double. The knack of multiple-tool multiple-blade cutting also continues to appear. In the parts factory alone, the number of people who found knacks in the month from January 20 to February 20 accounted for one-third of the entire workshop, increasing production efficiency by 40 to 100 percent. Even the East Factory machining workshop, which was the worst at learning advanced experience in the past, has universally promoted the rapid cutting method. In the new factory's machining workshop, the old technical norms were revised. This work would have taken at least half a month to revise in the past, but now it can be discussed and resolved in just one day.

    东北某机器厂怎样发动工人
    在反贪污运动中每月提前完成生产任务
    东北机械工业管理局所属某机器厂的反贪污斗争，和生产结合得很好。到目前为止，在反贪污战线上已取得不小成绩，并锻炼了一批“打虎健将”，提拔了一批工人干部，工人觉悟空前提高。在生产战线上，一、二月份生产任务都提前完成了，产品质量也提高了很多。如去年十二月份，一级品占百分之十五点九，三级品占百分之十一点三；今年一月份一级品占百分之六十二，消灭了三级品；二月份一级品占百分之九十八以上，消灭了三级品。
    反贪污运动开始后，这个厂就在党组织的统一领导下，统一了思想，实行了明确的分工。党总支书记、第一厂长、工会主席、青年团总支书记及抽调出的优秀干部、职工，组织节约检查委员会，下设
    “打虎队”；在各车间组织突击组（后改为调查研究组），调查贪污分子的线索。第二厂长和工会生产委员、党和青年团的总支宣传委员负责领导生产。车间直接领导生产的干部，不予抽调。行政和党组织号召全体职工，每天抽两小时的业余时间参加反贪污斗争，两路进军。
    克服右倾思想，紧紧依靠工人
    在春节前，这个厂的反贪污斗争就全面展开了，但工人劲头不大。原因是：有的工人曾经占过公家的一点小便宜，又不了解政策，于是只检讨自己，不敢检举别人；有的工人看到“打虎”组织中有手脚不干净的分子和官僚主义分子，怀疑领导方面的决心，怕现在检举了将来“穿小鞋”。领导方面了解了这些思想情况，即刻宣布：有公私不分的小问题的人，只要以后不犯就行。厂和车间的领导干部都做了检讨，号召群众检举密告。接着召集干部大会，吸收车间工人代表参加，并在会上进行民主选举，把群众怀疑和不满意的人，清出“打虎队”，及时地纯洁并扩大了“打虎”组织。被选举的人多是得到群众拥护和信任的优秀职工，他们工龄长，威信高，熟悉工厂历史情况，有勇有谋。二月三日，全厂召开了第一次斗争大会。但由于工人还不摸底，会没开好；部分职员和工人认为“左”了，“没有就算了吧，何必强挤？”产生了右倾思想。实际上，不是没问题，而是方法不对头。于是领导方面又组织群众，再次清查工具仓库。在清查中，工人从天棚上、地板里、角落里，找出了许多没有记账的器材，发现了账上有以小报大、以少报多、改品名、开假发票等一系列的贪污花招。同时，又查出了大贪污犯于春太在一九四九年建厂时盗卖了国家八台机床。领导方面充分掌握了材料，又在二月十日开斗争大会，用事实教育职工，克服了右倾思想。领导方面又启发工人大胆怀疑，跟踪追击。会后，木型班工人立即响应号召，提出：“我们作木型，干不完往外包，这里边没问题吗？”“给班长提的意见为什么被抹掉了呢？这里一定有问题！”领导方面分析了情况，进一步发动工人来控诉。结果，查出了于德春是个大贪污犯；他想把好技术工人都挤出去，使工厂的活干不完，以便包给私商，从中贪污。
    组织工人群众参加反贪污斗争
    这个工厂除抽调优秀工人专门进行反贪污斗争外，并在反贪污斗争和生产结合的方针下，在生产时间以外，组织车间群众参加反贪污斗争。方法是：
    （1）节约检查委员会办公室把贪污分子的贪污材料和线索印发给车间，由工人讨论，以便发动工人调查。车间组织调查研究组，开展群众性的调查研究工作。工人非常愿意接受这一任务，下班后纷纷出去找线索，找关系。工友郝景波认为总务科和建华印刷所经常有来往，可能有问题，便动员他的在建华当外柜的表哥，揭露了这个印刷所经理行贿和总务科熊丰荣偷盗国家财产的行为。
    （2）开老工人座谈会。凡是群众提出来的疑问和领导方面弄不清的问题，就召开老工人座谈会来解决。如有一张领料单上写着：修理部领十七点五米厘钻头二十根，但找老工人一对，证实了这张领料单是被材料库修改了的，修理部只领过一两根。
    （3）在不影响生产的情况下，经常派工人代表参加小型斗争会。此外，领导干部掌握了材料，先在本部门斗争（其他部门派代表参加）；如果贪污分子不肯彻底交代问题时，便有准备地举行全厂职工参加的大型斗争会。他们利用星期日开大型的斗争会。这样，材料足（准备了一周），时间长，工人都能参加。群众调查的丰富材料和他们在斗争会上的巨大压力，使贪污分子胆战心惊，觉得问题保不住、赖不了、逃不掉，因而便低头认罪。
    及时修订爱国公约，发动和“打虎”结合的生产竞赛
    职工在运动开始时情绪很热烈，检举了很多贪污分子的材料。但当运动深入以后，工人们觉得自己知道的事实都已检举出来，没有什么事情好做了，因此情绪就逐渐低落下去。同时，运动深入了，大贪污犯也更加狡猾。因此，如何继续发动群众，就成为一个急待解决的问题了。这个工厂解决这一问题的办法是修订爱国公约，发动与反贪污相结合的生产竞赛。他们召集各车间的工会主席、生产委员、文教委员开会，具体讨论修订爱国公约的办法，大家一致决定新公约的基本内容应该包括五个方面：
    （一）积极参加反贪污斗争，清除一切贪污分子；（二）保证完成生产任务；（三）解决本车间、小组存在的关键问题；（四）加强防火、防奸、防盗、防空的四防工作；（五）积极参加政治学习，并努力推广先进生产经验。接着，领导方面就发动各车间、各小组进行讨论。在工人们讨论过程中，领导方面又向工人们反复进行了宣传教育和具体指导，因而使修订后的爱国公约都有明确的中心内容。
    工人们修订了爱国公约后，他们的政治积极性立刻高涨起来，各车间都为实现爱国公约展开了挑战、应战。许多工人除积极调查本厂贪污分子的材料外，还把自己知道的其他公营工厂中的问题也提出来。多刀多刃切削法首创者高光珍过去曾在荣军机械厂做过工，他下班后就去找以前和他一起做过工的工友，调查荣军机械厂厂长被奸商拉拢共同偷盗国家木材、铜、铁的事实。在生产方面，工人们都按照爱国公约中规定的目标努力生产，如铸工马保芝二月份的产量超过任务百分之二十，没出一个废品。过去最落后的零件车间，在这次运动中也连续出现了五个改进生产的窍门。
    工人们提前完成二月份生产任务后，根据三月份的生产计划，又修订了一次爱国公约，其中产量、质量的标准都比二月份提高了。为了保证实现这个标准，又规定了每星期六检查一次爱国公约执行情况等制度。
    及时从工人中提拔干部，并修改制度
    随着工人觉悟的提高，贪污分子的被撤职，领导方面及时地大胆地提拔了斗争中的积极分子，代理科长、股长等职务；并指定专人帮助他们熟悉业务，使他们迅速地学会了业务工作。因此，保证了材料的供应。这就打破了一些人过去的错误看法。过去有些职工总认为“管材料就是看大堆，没有啥”、“干材料工作有个人就行，把能力强的人放在那里是糟蹋”。在这次运动中，他们亲眼看到了贪污分子对国家的危害，发现盗窃增产节约果实一万零五百多吨粮食的贪污犯，就是平时认为“没有啥”的管理材料的刘成有等，他们才深刻认识到材料供应工作的重要性。因此，领导方面提出要选拔一批人到材料部门工作时，全厂职工就主动地、愉快地把车间里最好的工人提出来。被选拔上的工人也都说：“领导方面把我们放在这样重要的岗位上，我们保证要把工作做好。”工人们说：“再不能让贪污分子占据生产管理部门。”“这样做，才是我们工人阶级当家作主人！”领导方面为了更加强生产上的领导作用，现仍继续准备提拔大批优秀工人作干部。同时，通过查账，不但找到了“虎穴”，清查了仓库，纠正了账目混乱现象，而且重新修正定时领料、发料、报销、验收、查库、安全负责制等一系列的制度。这些制度，都是在工人直接参加和主动要求的情况下修订的，它拥有广大的群众基础，因此，群众都能自觉地遵守。
    工人的阶级觉悟和生产热情提高
    工人在反贪污斗争中，更清楚地认识了资产阶级的丑恶面貌及其卑鄙手段，阶级觉悟提高了，生产热忱高涨了，因而提前完成了生产任务。如：木型、零件两个车间，过去经常完不成任务，被称为落后车间；现在由于工人觉悟提高，二月份也提前五天完成任务。钳工厂某组抽出了四名技工“打虎”，但任务仍提前五天完成。三个加工车间，已普遍地推广了快速切削先进工作法，生产效率提高了一倍以上。多刀多刃的窍门，也继续出现。仅零件厂由一月二十日至二月二十日的一个月中，找出窍门的人数，占全车间的三分之一，提高生产效率百分之四十到一百。连过去学习先进经验最差的东厂加工车间，也普遍推广了快速切削法。在新厂加工车间，修改了旧技术定额。这种工作，在过去至少要半个月才能修改好，现在只要一天就讨论好了。
