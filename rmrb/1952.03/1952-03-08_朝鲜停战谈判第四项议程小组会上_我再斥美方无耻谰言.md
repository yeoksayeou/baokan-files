Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. At the Korean Armistice Talks Third Agenda Staff Meeting on March 7th, our side submitted to the other side the complete draft of our side's clauses regarding the preamble to the armistice agreement, issues concerning the military demarcation line and demilitarized zone (Article 1), and specific arrangements for the ceasefire and armistice (Article 2). The other side agreed to have the translators from both sides proofread the text of the agreed-upon parts after studying our side's draft. Regarding the unagreed-upon parts of the draft, our side again requested the other side to consider and accept our proposal.

At the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee, the other side continued to evade discussing the principles for resolving the existing fundamental issues of the Fourth Agenda, and defended its groundless so-called "voluntary repatriation" and illegal so-called "reclassification" with its long-refuted excuses, and repeated its fabricated slander that our side forcibly enlisted the other side's captured personnel. Our representative clearly pointed out that this attitude of the other side only shows that the other side is deliberately delaying the meeting, and has no other purpose.

    朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组会上
    我再斥美方无耻谰言
    【新华社开城七日电】三月七日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方提交对方停战协定序言、有关军事分界线与非军事区问题（第一条）以及停火停战的具体安排问题（第二条）的全部我方条文草案。对方同意在研究我方草案后，由双方翻译人员校正已协议部分的文字。对于草案中未协议部分，我方再次要求对方考虑并接受我方提案。
    第四项议程小组委员会上，对方继续回避讨论解决第四项议程现存基本问题的原则，并以其早已被驳得体无完肤的藉口辩护其毫无理由的所谓“自愿遣返”和非法的所谓“重行分类”，并重复其一手捏造的所谓我方强编对方被俘人员入伍的谰言。我方代表明白指出对方这种态度只是表明对方蓄意拖延会议，别无其他目的。
