    The First Female Aviators of New China
    Paintings by Miao Di and Zhao Zhifang
    (Based on Zhang Wen's report "The First Female Aviators of New China")
    I. On March 8th, International Women's Day, 1952, a ceremony was held in the capital to celebrate the first take-off of New China's first group of female aviators. This first group of female aviators set a glorious example for women in New China to master aviation technology and participate in national defense construction.
    II. A year prior, in order to strengthen national defense, a group of outstanding young women responded to the call of the motherland and joined military cadre schools one after another. Some of these young women were determined to dedicate themselves to the people's aviation cause. After passing inspections and examinations, they were honorably admitted. Full of excitement, they bid farewell to their classmates and relatives and went to aviation school.
    III. To study and become a female soldier of the People's Liberation Army Air Force requires a high level of political consciousness, the will to dedicate oneself to defending the motherland, a high degree of discipline, and the spirit to overcome difficulties. Therefore, they first began serious and earnest political study to strengthen their ideological training to ensure the completion of their learning tasks.

    （根据张文“新中国第一批女航空人员”的报道而作）
    一、一九五二年的“三八”国际妇女节，在首都举行了庆祝新中国第一批女航空人员“三八”起飞典礼。这第一批女航空人员为新中国妇女掌握航空技术、参加国防建设事业树立了光荣的榜样。
    二、一年以前，为了加强国防建设，一批优秀的女青年响应祖国的号召，先后参加了军事干部学校。其中一部分女青年决心要献身人民航空事业，经过检查考试合格，她们被光荣地录取了。她们满怀兴奋地告别了同学和亲友，前往航空学校。
    三、学习做一个人民解放军空军的女战士，是需要有很高的政治觉悟、献身保卫祖国的意志、高度的纪律性和克服困难的精神的。所以她们首先就开始了严肃、认真的政治学习，加强思想的锻炼，来保证学习任务的完成。
