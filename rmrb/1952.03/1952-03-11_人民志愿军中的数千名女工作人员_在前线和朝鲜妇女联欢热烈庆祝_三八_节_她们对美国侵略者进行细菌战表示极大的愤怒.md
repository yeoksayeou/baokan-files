Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 10th: This reporter reports: Several thousand female staff members of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front held memorial meetings and get-togethers on March 8th, and warmly celebrated "March 8th" International Women's Day with Korean women who have contributed greatly to the war to defend their country and resist aggression.

At the celebration meeting of all the female staff members of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army leadership organs, Commander Peng Dehuai personally attended and spoke. In his speech, he pointed out: In the past year or so, thousands of female comrades in the army have established many glorious achievements in the just war of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the country, and demonstrated a great spirit of internationalism. Up to now, more than 800 people have been elected as model workers and rated as people's meritorious workers. Commander Peng Dehuai also said: The liberation of women is linked to the liberation of the nation and the liberation of the class. Without the liberation of the nation and the liberation of the class, there is no liberation of women; therefore, the women of New China must love their motherland and make unremitting struggles to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland and the peace and justice of mankind.

Female staff members on the medical front unanimously expressed their determination to fight to the end to defeat the germ warfare of American imperialism while warmly celebrating their festival. Female medical workers of the General Hygiene Department of the Volunteer Army and female staff members of the recently voluntarily arrived in Korea anti-epidemic inspection team jointly held a celebration meeting. Female doctors and nurses who had been working on the Korean battlefield reported at the meeting on their deeds of rescuing, treating, and nursing the wounded on the Korean battlefield for more than a year, and exchanged work experience with their sisters who had just come from the motherland. They expressed incomparable anger at the towering crimes of American imperialism continuing to spread a large number of bacterial insects on the Korean battlefield and in Andong, Fushun and other places in Northeast China. All attendees wrote letters to Chairman Mao and women across the country, expressing their determination to win a complete victory in the anti-bacterial war. Among the 375 female medical workers in a certain field hospital, 30% gloriously performed meritorious service. At the celebration meeting they held, many female model workers reported their model deeds. At the meeting, they wrote letters to Chairman Mao and the women compatriots of the motherland, saying: "For more than a year, our female medical workers have fought side by side with male medical workers on the medical front of the Korean front, and have withstood many serious tests, overcome various difficulties, and completed the tasks assigned to us by the people of the motherland; and a large number of meritorious models have emerged. Now American imperialism, regardless of the opposition of the people of the world, is carrying out a dehumanizing bacteriological war in Korea. The enemy's atrocities have aroused our infinite anger, and we will definitely exert all our strength to resolutely smash all the enemy's evil actions and fight to the end to defend peace!"

At the get-together held by female staff members of many units and Korean women, a noble international friendship blended between Chinese and Korean women. Female staff members of a certain unit jointly held a celebration meeting of more than 600 people with local Korean female workers, government staff, and members of the Korean Democratic Women's Union. The chairman of the local Democratic Women's Union reported at the meeting on the great achievements of the local working women in the war against America. She expressed her heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese women for their great assistance to the Korean people and women. At the meeting, the representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also expressed lofty respect and gratitude to the Korean women who are engaged in heroic struggles and love the Volunteer Army.

    人民志愿军中的数千名女工作人员
    在前线和朝鲜妇女联欢热烈庆祝“三八”节
    她们对美国侵略者进行细菌战表示极大的愤怒
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】本社记者报道：在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军中的数千名女工作人员，在三月八日分别举行纪念会和联欢会，并与在保卫祖国反对侵略的战争中贡献了巨大力量的朝鲜妇女举行联欢，热烈庆祝“三八”国际妇女节。
    在中国人民志愿军领导机关的全体女工作人员的庆祝大会上，彭德怀司令员曾亲临讲话。他在讲话中指出：一年多来全军数千个女同志在抗美援朝保家卫国的正义战争中，建立了很多的光荣功绩，表现出伟大的国际主义精神，到目前为止，已经有八百多人当选为模范工作者和被评为人民功臣。彭德怀司令员并说：妇女的解放是和民族的解放、阶级的解放联系在一起的，没有民族的解放和阶级的解放就没有妇女的解放；因此新中国的妇女必须热爱自己的祖国，为保卫祖国的独立和自由以及人类的和平与正义作不懈的斗争。
    医务战线上的女工作人员们在热烈庆祝自己的节日时，一致表示了为战胜美帝国主义的细菌战而斗争到底的决心。志愿军总卫生部的女医务工作者和最近志愿来朝的防疫检验队中的女工作人员联合举行了庆祝大会。早在朝鲜战场上工作的女医生和女护士在会上报告了一年多来她们在朝鲜战场上抢救、治疗和护理伤员的事迹，并和刚来自祖国的姊妹们互相交流工作经验。她们对美帝国主义继续在朝鲜战场上和在祖国东北的安东、抚顺等地大量撒布细菌毒虫的滔天罪行，表示无比的愤怒。全体到会者写信给毛主席和全国妇女，表示她们保证取得反细菌战彻底胜利的决心。在某战地医院的三百七十五名女医务工作者中，有百分之三十光荣地立了功。她们举行的庆祝大会上，许多女模范工作者报告了自己的模范事迹。她们在会上写信给毛主席和祖国的妇女同胞说：“一年多来，我们女医务工作者和男医务工作者一道并肩战斗在朝鲜前线的医务战线上，经受了许多严重的考验，克服了各种困难，完成了祖国人民交给我们的任务；并涌现了大批的功臣模范。现在美帝国主义不顾世界人民的反对，正在朝鲜进行灭绝人性的细菌战争。敌人的暴行激起了我们无比愤怒，我们一定发挥全部力量，坚决粉碎敌人的一切罪恶行动，为保卫和平而战斗到底！”
    在许多单位的女工作人员与朝鲜妇女举行的联欢会上，中朝两国妇女间交融着崇高的国际友爱。某部女工作人员与当地的朝鲜女工人、政府工作人员、朝鲜民主妇女同盟盟员联合举行了六百多人的庆祝会。该地民主妇女同盟委员长在会上报告了当地劳动妇女在抗美战争中的伟大功绩。她对中国妇女给予朝鲜人民和妇女的伟大援助表示衷心的感谢。会上，中国人民志愿军的代表也向进行着英雄的斗争并热爱志愿军的朝鲜妇女表示崇高的敬意和感谢。
