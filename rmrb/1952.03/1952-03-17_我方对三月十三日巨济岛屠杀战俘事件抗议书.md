I am instructed by our chief representative to present the following protest to your side. Please forward this protest to your chief representative. In your side's "notification" to our side on March 15th, you "meticulously" described the massacre of our captured personnel under your custody as a conflict among our captured personnel, resulting in deaths and injuries. Our side completely rejects your self-contradictory and riddled narrative. It is entirely inconceivable that our captured personnel, under your supervision and disarmed, would "attack" each other and cause so many deaths and injuries. No sophistry or distortion can conceal the bloody fact that your side massacred our captured personnel. Following the bloody incident on February 18, 1952, in which your side barbarously massacred our captured personnel at the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, within a month, your side not only failed to provide our side with a responsible explanation for the February 18th incident, but on March 13, 1952, once again barbarously massacred our captured personnel under your custody. It should be pointed out that your side no longer has any excuse to escape the grave responsibility for this bloody incident. Your side's barbaric and continuous massacre of our captured personnel cannot be tolerated indefinitely. Our side lodges a serious protest with your side against this series of bloody incidents and demands that your side immediately provide a responsible explanation for the March 13th incident and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Your side must know that just as our side is responsible to your side for the safety of your captured personnel under our custody, your side should bear full responsibility to our side for the safety of our captured personnel under your custody. Our side awaits your satisfactory reply with grave concern.

    我方对三月十三日巨济岛屠杀战俘事件抗议书
    我奉我方首席代表之命，向你方提出下列抗议。请你将这一抗议转给你方首席代表。你方在三月十五日给我方的“通知”，“周密”地将你方对于在你方收容之下的我方被俘人员的屠杀，叙述成为我方被俘人员之间的冲突，因而造成死伤。对于你方的这种自相矛盾漏洞百出的叙述，我方完全不能接受。在你方的看管之下，并被解除了武装的我方被俘人员，会互相“攻击”，并造成这样多的人的死伤，是完全不可能设想的。任何诡辩与歪曲都不能掩盖你方屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥事实。一九五二年二月十八日你方在巨济岛战俘营，野蛮地屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥事件以后，一个月之内，你方不仅未对二月十八日的事件向我方作负责的交代，竟于一九五二年三月十三日再一次对于在你方收容下的我方被俘人员，施行野蛮的屠杀。应该指出你方已再没有任何藉口逃脱对此次血腥事件的严重责任。你方这种野蛮地连续屠杀我方被俘人员的事件，不可能长此以往地被容忍下去。我方对这一连续发生的血腥事件，向你方提出严重抗议，并要求你方对三月十三日事件，立即作负责的交代，并保证以后不再发生同样的事件。你方必须知道，正如我方对于在我方收容下的你方被俘人员的安全向你方负有责任一样，你方对于在你方收容下的我方被俘人员的安全，应向我方负完全的责任。我方以严重的关切心情，等待你方的满意答覆。
