(VII) By this time, Luo Shengjiao's blood was nearly frozen, his whole body was purple, his face pale, and he was already exhausted. But determined to rescue the Korean boy, he took another deep breath, sank to the bottom, stepped on the pebbles there, and did his utmost to use his head to push Cui Ying to the surface. At that moment, the barber of the company heard the news and hurriedly grabbed a telephone pole and rushed over. Cui Ying grabbed the pole and was pulled to safety.

(VIII) However, Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed himself to save others, never surfaced again and was swept away by the rapids under the ice. The barber, who couldn't swim, quickly ran back to call for help. By the time people arrived and chopped open the ice with axes to pull him up, he had already stopped breathing. More than twenty Korean families in the village gathered around the martyr's body, weeping as if they had lost a loved one.

(IX) That afternoon, villagers streamed to the military unit's base, repeatedly pleading with the unit's leader: "Comrade Luo sacrificed himself to save our child. Please give us his body so we can bury him with the most solemn Korean funeral!" Their earnest request was finally accepted by the leadership of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    （七）这时，罗盛教身上的血液快冻结了，全身发紫，面色苍白，已经精疲力尽了；但他为了决心救出这朝鲜少年，就又一次深深地吸了一口气，沉入水底，脚踏河底碎石，竭尽全力用自己的头将崔?顶出水面。这时候，连部的理发员听到这个消息，就急忙拿了一根电线杆子赶到，崔?抱住杆子被救了上来。
    （八）但是，舍己救人的罗盛教同志却再也没有浮出水面，就被急流冲到远处的冰层下面去了。不会泅水的理发员飞快地跑回去叫人来救。等人赶来用斧子斫开冰层捞他上来的时候，他已经停止呼吸了。村里的二十多户朝鲜老乡都赶来围在烈士身旁，像丧失了亲人一样地痛哭。
    （九）当天下午，老乡们川流不息地跑到部队的驻地，再三请求部队的负责人说：“罗同志为了救我们的孩子而牺牲了，请你们把他的遗体交给我们，按照朝鲜人民最隆重的葬礼安葬他吧！”他们的恳切要求终于被中国人民志愿军某部领导机关接受了。
