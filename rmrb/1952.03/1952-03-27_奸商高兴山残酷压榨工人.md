    The Unscrupulous Merchant Gao Xingshan Cruelly Exploits Workers
    To the Editor: Gao Xingshan, the unscrupulous merchant of Jufeng Coal Mine in Mentougou, Beijing, has been cruelly exploiting workers and stealing state property for the past three years. After Gao Xingshan bribed Guo Yamin, the chairman of the labor union, and Cheng Cheng, the accountant, he boldly created false accounts and sold coal that was not reported to private merchants. He used every possible method to evade taxes. After bribing the weigher from the China Coal Construction Company, he unscrupulously mixed stones and furnace ash into the coal, or substituted inferior coal for good coal. He used a large scale for purchasing and a small scale for selling. He embezzled more than 20 million yuan in worker wages. As for delaying wage payments, it was even more common. The wages for November of last year have not been paid to this day, but the workers have to work even if they have nothing to eat. Whenever workers mention this matter, Gao Xingshan immediately calls on Guo Yamin to threaten them. Gao Xingshan often beats and scolds workers, and does not provide medical treatment when workers are sick. He does not implement the labor-management contract, falsely reports the total wage amount, and underpays the labor union's cultural and educational funds, labor insurance and other fees by more than 15 million yuan. During the anti-theft movement, he, like all unscrupulous merchants, attempted to muddle through. It was not until the workers struggled repeatedly that he lowered his head. We demand that the government severely punish the unscrupulous merchant Gao Xingshan. Tong Lin

    奸商高兴山残酷压榨工人
    编辑同志：北京门头沟聚丰煤窑奸商高兴山，三年来残酷剥削工人，盗窃国家财产。高兴山收买了工会主席郭亚民、会计员程秤以后，就大胆地造假账，并将漏报煤售给私商。一切可以漏税的方式，他都用过。他向中国煤建公司的监磅员行贿后，即肆无忌惮地在煤内掺石头、炉灰，或以次煤顶替。他用大秤收、小秤卖。他克扣工人工资二千多万元。至于拖欠工资更是常事，去年十一月份的工资到现在还没有发给，但工人吃不上饭也得干活。工人们一提这个事，高兴山马上就叫郭亚民出马威胁工人。高兴山经常打骂工人，工人有病，也不给治。他不执行劳资合同，谎报工资总额，少缴了工会文教、劳保等费一千五百多万元。在反盗窃运动中，他和所有奸商一样，企图矇混过“关”。直到工人一再斗争，他才低了头。我们要求政府严惩奸商高兴山。佟林
