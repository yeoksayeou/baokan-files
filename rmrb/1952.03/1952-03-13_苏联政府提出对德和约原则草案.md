Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 11th: The Soviet government sent three identical notes to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France on March 10 regarding the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany. Attached to the notes was a draft of the principles for a German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet Union.

The full text of the note to the United States government is as follows:

"The Soviet Government considers it necessary to call the attention of the United States Government to the fact that although nearly seven years have passed since the end of the war in Europe, a peace treaty with Germany has still not been concluded.

In order to eliminate such an abnormal situation, the Soviet Government supports the letter from the Government of the German Democratic Republic to the Governments of the Four Powers requesting the acceleration of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet Government suggests to the United States Government, as well as the Governments of Great Britain and France, that the issue of a German peace treaty be discussed immediately, so that a draft treaty agreed upon by all parties can be prepared in the near future and submitted to a special international conference attended by all relevant countries for consideration.

It is understood that the drafting of such a treaty must involve the participation of Germany, that is, a pan-German government representing the will of the German people. Therefore, the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France, the powers exercising control over Germany, must also study the internal conditions of Germany in order to establish a pan-German government that expresses the will of the German people as soon as possible.

In order to facilitate the work of drafting the treaty, the Soviet Government suggests that the United States, British, and French governments consider the draft principles for a German peace treaty attached to this note.

The Soviet Government submits this draft for discussion and is willing to consider any suggestions others may have on this issue.

The Soviet Government hopes to receive a reply from the United States Government to the above suggestions as soon as possible.

The Soviet Government has sent identical notes to the governments of Great Britain and France separately.

Soviet Government's Draft on the Peace Treaty with Germany

Nearly seven years have passed since the end of the war against Germany, but Germany still does not have a treaty, remains divided, and is in a position of inequality with other countries. This abnormal situation must be terminated. Terminating this situation is fully in line with the wishes of all peace-loving people. Without the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, it is impossible to guarantee a fair attitude towards the legitimate national interests of the German people.

Concluding a peace treaty with Germany is of great significance for consolidating peace in Europe. After the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, it will be possible to finally resolve the various problems arising from the Second World War. The resolution of these problems is of vital interest to various European countries that have suffered from Hitler's aggression, especially Germany's neighbors. Concluding a peace treaty with Germany will help improve the overall international situation and thus be conducive to establishing lasting peace.

Due to the failure to implement the relevant resolutions of the Potsdam Conference to date, German militarism, which caused two world wars, has not been eradicated, and the danger of its revival has not been completely eliminated. This determines the need to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The German peace treaty must ensure the elimination of the possibility of the revival of German militarism and the resurgence of German aggression.

Concluding a peace treaty with Germany will establish a lasting state of peace for the German people, will help Germany develop into a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving country in accordance with the Potsdam resolutions, and will guarantee the German people the opportunity to cooperate peacefully with other countries.

Based on these reasons, the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France have decided to begin drafting a peace treaty with Germany immediately.

The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain, and France believe that the drafting of the treaty must involve the participation of Germany, that is, a pan-German government representing Germany, and at the same time, the German peace treaty must be based on the following principles:

### 苏联政府提出对德和约原则草案

    苏联政府提出对德和约原则草案
    照会美英法三国政府建议立即讨论对德和约问题并尽早建立全德政府草拟和约
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：苏联政府于三月十日就缔结对德和约问题以内容相同的照会三件送致美、英、法三国政府。照会中并附有苏联所提出的对德和约原则草案。
    致美国政府的照会全文如下：
    “苏联政府认为必须促请美国政府注意：欧洲的战争虽然已经结束将近七年了，可是对德和约仍然没有缔结。
    为了消除这样一种不正常的局势，苏联政府支持德意志民主共和国政府致四大国政府要求加速缔结对德和约的公函，苏联政府并向美国政府以及英、法两国政府建议，立即讨论对德和约的问题，以便在最近期间准备好各方一致同意的和约草案，提交一切有关国家参加的特别的国际会议考虑。
    大家都了解，草拟这样的和约，必须有德国参加，也就是说，由一个代表德国的全德政府参加。因此，苏联、美国、英国和法国这几个对德国执行管制权力的国家，还必须研究德国的国内条件问题，以便尽早建立一个表达德国人民意志的全德政府。
    为了使得拟订和约草案的工作得以顺利进行，苏联政府建议美国、英国和法国政府考虑附于本照会的对德和约原则草案。
    苏联政府提出这项草案请大家讨论，同时，别人在这个问题上如果有什么建议，苏联政府也愿意加以考虑。
    苏联政府希望能尽早接到美国政府对上述建议的答覆。
    苏联政府已将同样的照会分别送交英国和法国的政府。
    苏联政府关于对德和约的草案
    对德战争结束已经将近七年了，但是，德国仍然没有一个和约，仍然处于分裂状态，处于与其他国家权利不平等的地位。这种不正常的局势必须终止。终止这种局势是完全符合一切爱好和平的人民的愿望的。如果不能早日缔结对德和约，也就不可能保证对德国人民合法的民族利益采取公正的态度。
    缔结对德和约对于巩固欧洲的和平有着极其重大的意义。缔结对德和约之后，就可能最后解决因为第二次世界大战而产生的种种问题。解决这些问题，对于欧洲各个曾经遭受希特勒侵略的国家，特别是德国的邻国，都有着切身的利害关系。缔结对德和约，将有助于改进整个国际形势，并因此而有利于建立持久的和平。
    由于波茨坦会议的有关各项决议迄今没有履行，曾经造成两次世界大战的德国军国主义还没有被根除，它复活的危险仍然没有完全消除。这就决定了必须加速缔结对德和约。对德和约必须保证消除德国军国主义复活和德国侵略再起的可能性。
    缔结对德和约，将为德国人民确立持久的和平状况，将有助于德国按照波茨坦决议发展成为统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的国家，并将保证德国人民有机会和其他国家和平合作。
    根据这些理由，苏联、美国、英国和法国政府决定立即开始草拟对德和约。
    苏联、美国、英国和法国政府认为，草拟和约时，必须有德国参加，亦即由一个代表德国的全德政府参加，同时，对德和约必须以下述的原则为基础：
    对德和约的原则

    （三）必须保证德国人民享有民主权利，以便受德国法律管辖的一切人民，不分种族、性别、语言或宗教信仰，一律享有人权和基本自由，包括言论、出版、宗教信仰、政治主张和集会的自由。
    （四）必须保证德国各民主党派和团体的自由活动，给予它们以自由决定其内部事务，举行大会和集会的权利，让它们享有出版和发行的自由。
    （五）一切敌视民主及敌视保卫和平事业的团体，都不能允许在德国境内存在。
    （六）一切前德国军队的服役人员，包括军官和将领，一切前纳粹分子，如非曾因罪行而被法庭判刑者，一律得享有与其他德国人民同等的公民权利和政治权利，以便他们能参与建设爱好和平的、民主的德国。
    （七）德国必须保证不参加任何旨在反对任何一个曾以自己的军队参加对德作战的国家的集团或军事联盟。
