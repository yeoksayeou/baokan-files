Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 24th: According to TASS, Paris newspapers published on the 21st a statement by Chamberlin, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the International Economic Conference, refuting the slanderous statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Acheson on the 14th against the International Economic Conference. Chamberlin pointed out: Acheson said that recently "the U.S. State Department has received many inquiries about the International Economic Conference." If Acheson were willing to provide answers and give a fair and objective explanation of the nature of the issues, he would be welcome. However, unfortunately, Acheson is attempting to influence American public opinion on the goals and tasks of the International Economic Conference, trying to discuss the conference from an incorrect angle and distorting its true objectives. In doing so, he used self-contradictory arguments. On the one hand, he talked about developing constructive international economic cooperation, believing that the United Nations and its specialized agencies are the most suitable places to discuss suggestions in this regard. On the other hand, he demanded stricter restrictions on exports and strengthened control over trade between East and West for so-called "security" reasons. In this case, how can we talk about developing international economic cooperation? Acheson's statement is essentially nothing more than advocating the strengthening of so-called "control" and restrictions on international trade, which absolutely cannot promote the expansion of international trade; on the contrary, it will only lead to the contraction and chaos of international trade.

Chamberlin emphasized, when discussing the relationship between the International Economic Conference and the United Nations economic agencies: the initiators of the International Economic Conference never intended to use this conference to antagonize the United Nations economic agencies. On the contrary, their goal is precisely to assist the United Nations in fulfilling its task of developing international trade, so that the United Nations can smoothly fulfill the important task of developing and consolidating international economic cooperation. The Preparatory Committee of the International Economic Conference has taken all measures to ensure that all economic agencies of the United Nations, such as the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the Economic Commission for Europe, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, the Economic Commission for Latin America, and the Department of Economic Affairs under the United Nations Secretariat, have representatives attending the International Economic Conference. This alone is sufficient to convincingly prove that Acheson's attempt to view the Moscow International Economic Conference as antagonistic to the United Nations economic agencies is completely unfounded. The International Economic Conference has not only invited representatives from countries that are members of the United Nations, but has also invited representatives from countries that are not members of the United Nations—China, West Germany and East Germany, Italy, Japan, etc. This fact clearly shows that the goal of the conference is to promote the real expansion of trade between countries around the world.

Chamberlin finally said: Acheson's statement proves that he cannot conceal his anxiety about the great significance of the International Economic Conference, because without a doubt, this conference will have a good impact on the development and consolidation of international relations that are currently being damaged, on the expansion of international trade, and on alleviating the current tense international situation. Acheson's statement disappointed many countries and all those in the United States itself who hope to promote international economic cooperation. The only correct explanation for this statement is that Acheson and the group he represents are hostile to any form of international economic cooperation. But this cannot prevent the efforts of those who advocate that international cooperation must replace international confrontation.

    国际经济会议筹委会秘书长香贝朗发表声明
    驳斥艾奇逊诬蔑国际经济会议的谰言
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：二十一日巴黎各报发表了国际经济会议筹备委员会秘书长香贝朗的声明，驳斥美国国务卿艾奇逊在十四日发表的诬蔑国际经济会议的声明。香贝朗指出：艾奇逊说最近“美国国务院接到了许多关于国际经济会议的询问”。如果艾奇逊愿意提出答复，并就问题的本质给予公正客观的解释，他是会受到欢迎的。可是，不幸艾奇逊却企图影响美国舆论对国际经济会议的目标和任务的看法，力图从不正确的角度来谈这个会议，并歪曲会议的真正目标。他这样做时，使用了自相矛盾的论据。他一方面谈到发展建设性的国际经济合作，认为联合国及其各专门机构是讨论这方面建议的最适宜的地方。另一方面，他又要求为了所谓“安全”的缘故更加严格地限制出口，加强统制东西方之间的贸易。既然这样，又怎能谈发展国际经济合作呢？艾奇逊的声明实质上不过是主张加强对国际贸易的所谓“管制”和限制，这种主张绝对不能促进国际贸易的扩大，相反只会促成国际贸易的萎缩和混乱。
    香贝朗谈到国际经济会议与联合国经济机构的关系时着重指出：国际经济会议的发起人绝不是打算用这个会议来和联合国各经济机构闹对立，相反地他们的目标恰恰是要协助联合国履行其发展国际贸易的任务，以使联合国顺利地履行发展和巩固国际经济合作的重要任务。国际经济会议筹备委员会已采取了一切措施来使联合国的所有经济机构，如联合国经社理事会、欧洲经济委员会、亚洲暨远东经济委员会、拉丁美洲经济委员会及联合国秘书处所属的经济事务部等，都有代表出席国际经济会议。仅此一点就足以令人信服地证明艾奇逊企图把莫斯科国际经济会议与联合国的经济机构对立起来看是完全没有根据的。国际经济会议不仅邀请了属于联合国的国家的代表，并且还邀请了不是联合国会员国的代表——中国、西德与东德、意大利、日本等。这一个事实清楚地表明：会议的目标是促进世界各国间贸易的真正扩展。
    香贝朗最后说：艾奇逊的声明证明了他无法掩饰他对于国际经济会议将具有极大意义一事所感到的焦虑，因为毫无疑问，这个会议对于现正遭受破坏的国际关系的发展与巩固、对于国际贸易的扩展以及减轻目前国际关系的紧张局势会有好的影响。艾奇逊的声明使许多国家及美国本国的所有希望促进国际经济合作的人感觉失望。这个声明的唯一正确的解释就是艾奇逊及他所代表的集团仇视任何样的国际经济合作。但是这并不能阻止那些主张必须用国际合作来代替国际对抗的人的努力。
