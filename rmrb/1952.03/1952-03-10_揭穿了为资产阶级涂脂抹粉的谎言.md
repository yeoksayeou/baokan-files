    Exposed the Lies Whitewashing the Bourgeoisie
    Editor: I recently browsed the People's Daily of December 6, 1951, and saw an article on the third page written by Chen Yisheng entitled "The Ideological Transformation Process of the National Bourgeoisie." Judging from the main content of the article, I think it is an article that praises the bourgeoisie. The article praised the "transformation" and "progress" of the bourgeoisie, generally praised the bourgeoisie as a "revolutionary class," and listed nine major achievements for them. The author of the article seems to be explaining that the bourgeoisie needs to be reformed, but he did not point out what should be reformed, but just praised the bourgeoisie. Many of the nine achievements he listed are nominal; some are simply not true. Such as the sixth achievement: "Supporting financial and economic tasks, the business community never owes taxes, does not evade taxes, does not escape taxes, and further achieves collective tax payment and advance tax payment"... These lies have been completely exposed in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery struggle. The author of this article wrote such an article entirely to whitewash the bourgeoisie, and the newspaper published such a work, I am afraid it is not enough to recognize the ugly side of the bourgeoisie.

    Editor's Note: Reader Zhang Liyun's opinion is correct. Many of the untruthful aspects of Chen Yisheng's article have been refuted by the facts revealed in the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, and I believe that in the future there will continue to be many facts to negate the erroneous views in the article.

    揭穿了为资产阶级涂脂抹粉的谎言
    编辑同志：我最近翻阅一九五一年十二月六日的人民日报时，看到第三版载有陈巳生所写“民族资产阶级的思想转变过程”一文。就文章的主要内容看来，我觉得那是一篇对资产阶级捧场的文章。文章称赞了资产阶级的“转变”和“进步”，一般地誉资产阶级为“革命的阶级”，并为他们罗列了九大功绩。文章的作者，好像是要说明资产阶级是需要改造的，但他一点也没有指出应该改造的是些什么东西，只是对资产阶级大吹一顿了事。他列举的九大功绩，许多都是有名无实的东西；有的根本不合乎事实。如功绩第六条：“支持财经任务，工商界从不欠税，不漏税，不逃税，进一步做到集体缴税和提前缴税”……。在反贪污、反行贿斗争中已完全揭穿了这些谎言。这篇文章的作者撰写这样的文章，完全是为资产阶级涂脂抹粉，报纸刊登这样的作品，恐怕是对资产阶级的丑恶一面认识不够。

    编者按：读者张力云的意见是正确的。陈巳生的文章中许多言不符实的地方，已经被反行贿、反偷漏税运动中揭露的事实所批驳了，相信今后继续会有许多事实，来否定该文中的错误观点。
