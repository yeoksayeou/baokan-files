A Brief Commentary on Cultural Life

Profoundly Recognize the Seriousness of Shi Linghe's Mistakes

Our newspaper published on March 15th a preliminary self-criticism by the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the mistakes made by Shi Linghe, Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. This self-criticism has a certain educational significance. However, it must be pointed out that this self-criticism is not profound enough. This is not to say that the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has not sufficiently exposed the facts of Shi Linghe's mistakes, but rather that the recognition and analysis of the seriousness of those mistakes and the ideological essence of those mistakes are very inadequate.

The self-criticism states: "Because he (referring to Shi Linghe) himself has a strong petty-bourgeois ideology and has abandoned ideological remolding, he peacefully coexists with bourgeois ideology and even feudal class ideology." Saying that Shi Linghe has a strong petty-bourgeois ideology is, of course, not a problem; but judging from the facts listed in the self-criticism, Shi Linghe is far more than just "having a strong petty-bourgeois ideology," nor is it a problem of his petty-bourgeois ideology "peacefully coexisting" with bourgeois ideology and even feudal class ideology. The nature of his ideological errors is much more serious. Let us look at these facts:

	First, Shi Linghe celebrated his father's birthday, widely issuing notices to solicit congratulatory poems and essays, and compiling his father's reactionary "poems and lyrics" that promoted feudal ideology, even praised American imperialism, eulogized landlords, and slandered the People's Liberation War, into a booklet and distributing it everywhere.

	Second, after the counter-revolutionary element Chen Wenlong was arrested, Shi Linghe, because he knew him, asked Ji Fumin, Secretary-General of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, to write a letter to comfort or bail him out. When Ji Fumin refused, Shi Linghe scolded Ji Fumin for "not obeying organizational leadership."

	Third, Shi Linghe had an improper love affair with a female comrade, and because he was criticized, his love poems contained so-called phrases such as "breaking through darkness and evil forces." According to the self-criticism report, Shi Linghe's "darkness" and "evil forces" refer to the Party's organizational discipline.

Spreading reactionary "poems and lyrics," sheltering counter-revolutionary elements, resisting the Party's organizational discipline—how can such thoughts and behaviors be simply encompassed by "petty-bourgeois ideology"? Obviously, this is already a serious reactionary speech and behavior. The self-criticism's statement of "peacefully coexisting with bourgeois ideology and even feudal class ideology" is also incorrect. The facts show that Shi Linghe's own ideology has been severely corrupted and degenerated by bourgeois ideology and feudal class ideology. The essence of his thought is originally bourgeois and even feudal, not a matter of "peacefully coexisting" with them. From this, it can be seen that the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has a very insufficient understanding of the seriousness of Shi Linghe's mistakes, its analysis of his ideological nature is not profound, and its estimation is incorrect. Therefore, it is impossible to have a more profound and thorough criticism of Shi Linghe.

It is necessary to profoundly and adequately recognize the seriousness of Shi Linghe's mistakes, point out the reactionary nature of his thoughts and behaviors, in order to educate him personally, and to alert others who have similar thoughts and behaviors to Shi Linghe. Therefore, we believe that the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China should conduct another in-depth self-criticism of Shi Linghe's mistakes, thoroughly criticize and deal with them; at the same time, it should also deeply review the problems and shortcomings that exist in the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee itself in its leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the entire literary and artistic work.

### 深刻认识石凌鹤的错误的严重性

    深刻认识石凌鹤的错误的严重性
    本报三月十五日登载了中共江西省委宣传部对江西省文联主任委员石凌鹤所犯错误的初步检查，这个检查有其一定的教育意义。但必须指出，这个检查是不深刻的。这不是说中共江西省委宣传部对于石凌鹤所犯错误的事实揭发不足，而是指对于所列举的那些错误的严重性和对于那些错误的思想实质的认识和分析非常不够。
    检查中说：“由于他（指石凌鹤）自己有浓厚的小资产阶级思想，并放弃了思想改造，因而和资产阶级思想甚至封建阶级思想和平共居。”说石凌鹤有浓厚的小资产阶级思想，当然不会有什么问题；但根据检查中所列举的那些事实看来，石凌鹤决不止于是“有浓厚的小资产阶级思想”，也不是他的小资产阶级思想和资产阶级思想、甚至封建阶级思想“和平共居”的问题。他的思想错误的性质要严重得多。请看这几桩事实吧：
    一、石凌鹤为他父亲做寿，大发启事，广征贺寿诗文，并将他父亲的宣传封建思想、甚至歌颂美帝国主义、歌颂大地主而诽谤人民解放战争的反动“诗词”，汇印成册，到处送人。
    二、反革命分子陈文龙被捕，石凌鹤因和他认识，就要江西省文联秘书长季夫民写信去慰问或保释，而季夫民不答应，石凌鹤竟责骂季夫民为“不服从组织领导”。
    三、石凌鹤跟一个女同志闹不正当的恋爱，因受到批评，在他所写的情诗中，竟有所谓“冲破黑暗和恶势力”等词句。据检查报告中说，石凌鹤所说的“黑暗”和“恶势力”是指党的组织纪律而言。
    散播反动“诗词”，袒护反革命分子，抗拒党的组织纪律，像这样的思想和行为，怎么能仅仅用“小资产阶级思想”来包括呢？显然地，这已经是严重的反动的言行了。检查中所说的“和资产阶级思想甚至封建阶级思想和平共居”，也是不正确的。事实说明石凌鹤本人的思想已经被资产阶级思想和封建阶级思想严重腐蚀而蜕化了。他的思想实质原就是资产阶级的甚至是封建阶级的，而不是跟它们“和平共居”的问题。由此可见，中共江西省委宣传部对石凌鹤的错误的严重性的认识是十分不够的，对于他的思想性质的分析是不深刻的，估计是不正确的，因此，对于石凌鹤也就不可能有更为深刻和彻底的批判。
    必须深刻地、足够地认识石凌鹤错误的严重性，指出他的思想和行为的反动性质，才能教育他本人，并警惕其他和石凌鹤有相似的思想行为的人们。因此，我们认为中共江西省委宣传部应该对石凌鹤的错误再作深刻检查，加以彻底批判并予以处理；同时，还应该深刻地检讨江西省委宣传部自己对于江西省文联和整个文艺工作的领导上所存在的问题和缺点。
