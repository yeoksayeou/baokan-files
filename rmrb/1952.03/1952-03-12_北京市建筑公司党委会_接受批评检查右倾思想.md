Reaction to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions

    Beijing Construction Company Party Committee
    Accepts Criticism and Examines Right-leaning Thought

    Editor: The People's Daily published a reader's letter on February 27 criticizing our company for allowing corrupt elements to lead the anti-corruption movement. We immediately convened a Party Committee meeting and examined our right-leaning thought.

    Our company's Deputy Manager, Cui Yancai, was dishonest, but at the beginning of the movement, we not only did not order him to confess his problems, but instead allowed him to lead the movement. During this period, although we criticized him and asked him to write a letter of repentance, we lightly let him off even though we knew his self-criticism was not thorough. Cui Yancai even interrogated the person who wrote the letter to the People's Daily. After we found out, we only asked him to write a self-criticism and did not take appropriate action. Kang Jishi, formerly a supervisor at the Yongmao Branch in Taiyuan and currently Deputy Director of the Employee Hospital, had a very serious problem (see People's Daily, March 1st), but we did not deal with it in a timely manner. It was not until February 25th that we ordered him to suspend his duties and reflect, and to confess his problems. Cai Zhenghua, Director of the General Manager's Office and Director of the Party Committee Office, had problems (see People's Daily, March 3rd) that were raised at the Party Committee meeting, but were later shelved. All of this shows that we were not serious or resolute in handling problems, that we were lenient towards these people, and unwilling to confront them directly. This right-leaning thought became a major obstacle to the anti-corruption movement. We have recognized the seriousness of right-leaning thought and must thoroughly correct it. Now, the higher-level Party Committee has ordered Li Gongxia, the Party Committee Secretary and General Manager of our company, to suspend his duties and reflect, and has removed Cui Yancai, Kang Jishi, and Cai Zhenghua from their positions. We thank comrades such as Cheng Xu for their criticism and help.

### 北京市建筑公司党委会  接受批评检查右倾思想

    北京市建筑公司党委会
    接受批评检查右倾思想
    编辑同志：二月二十七日人民日报刊载了读者来信，批评我公司不应让贪污分子领导反贪污运动。我们立即召开党委会，检讨了我们的右倾思想。
    我公司副经理崔彦彩手脚不干净，而我们在运动开始时不但未令其交代问题，反让他领导运动。在此期间，我们虽对他进行过批评，要他写悔过书，但明知他检讨不深刻，仍轻轻地放了过去。崔彦彩曾追问写稿给人民日报的人，我们知道后只要他写检讨，也未作适当处理。原太原市永茂分公司监理、现职工医院副主任康济时的问题很严重（见三月一日人民日报），但我们没有及时处理，直到二月二十五日始令其停职反省，交代问题。总经理办公室主任兼党委会办公室主任蔡正华的问题（见三月三日人民日报）虽然在党委会上提出过，但以后也被搁置起来。这些都说明我们在处理问题上不认真、不坚决，对这些人姑息，撕不破脸皮。这种右倾思想变成反贪污运动很大的障碍。我们已认清了右倾思想的严重性，一定要加以彻底纠正。现在，上级党委已令我公司党委书记兼总经理李公侠停职反省，撤去崔彦彩、康济时、蔡正华的职务。我们感谢程序等同志的批评和帮助。
