Xinhua News Agency, March 14th: In order to expedite the handling of cases, the Beijing Committee for the Practice of Economy Inspection has ordered all industrial and commercial households to re-fill the "Investigation and Handling Form for Illegal Acts of Industrial and Commercial Households."

Since late last month, the Beijing Committee for the Practice of Economy Inspection has distributed investigation forms, instructing all industrial and commercial households to fill them out. However, many illegal industrial and commercial households, harboring the idea of ​​getting away with it, were extremely dishonest in their fillings. Some continued to conceal the facts, some shielded each other, and some tried every means to evade the scrutiny of shop employees and workers. The vast majority of these facts were exposed by the staff and workers. In order to save these industrial and commercial households and prevent them from suffering severe punishment in the future, the Municipal Committee for the Practice of Economy Inspection has, since the 13th, convened meetings of industrial and commercial households in various districts, ordering them to re-fill the forms truthfully. The content of this form is the same as the last time, but the review procedures are more clearly defined and stricter. The forms filled out by each household will go through five levels of review before a final decision is made. After each household fills out the form, it will be reviewed by the industrial and commercial household study group, then by the accountant or bookkeeper of the industrial and commercial household, then by the workers or shop employees of the factory or shop, then by the district trade union office, and finally by the municipal and district committees for the Practice of Economy Inspection. After this level-by-level review, the Committee for the Practice of Economy Inspection will handle the cases separately based on the "Standards and Measures for Classifying and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households by the Beijing Municipal People's Government" passed by the Government Administration Council.

Currently, industrial and commercial households in various districts are beginning to re-fill the forms. Given that the industrial and commercial households took the forms home to fill out the first time, and some delayed filling them out under various pretexts, the district committees for the Practice of Economy Inspection have decided that this time, the forms will be filled out collectively in industrial and commercial household study groups, with guidance from personnel dispatched by the Committee for the Practice of Economy Inspection, and must be completed within half a day to a day. The study group will then review the forms, with a time limit of one day. After the group review, the study group leader will hand the forms over to the household accountant for review, with a review time of half a day. The accountant will then hand them over to the workers or shop employees for review, and then they will be submitted level by level. It is estimated that the processing of the first, second, and third categories of industrial and commercial households will be largely completed by the 20th of this month.

    为挽救违法工商户使其免受严厉处罚
    北京市限令各工商户重填处理表
    违法工商户应彻底放弃矇混过关的思想
    【新华社十四日讯】北京市节约检查委员会已限令各工商户重新填具“工商业户违法事实调查处理表”，以便迅速进行处理。
    北京市节约检查委员会自上月下旬就曾分发调查表格令各工商户填报。但许多违法的工商户抱着矇混过关的思想，填写时极不老实，有的继续隐瞒，有的互相包庇，有的千方百计逃避店员工人的审查。这些事实绝大部分都被职工群众揭发出来。市节约检查委员会为了挽救这些工商业户，避免他们以后遭受严厉的处罚，特自十三日起，分区召开工商户会议，责令他们重新据实填报。这次表格的内容和上次相同，但审查手续更加明确和严格。各户填具的表格，将经过五层审查手续才能最后定案。各户把表格填写以后交工商户学习小组审查，第二步交各该工商户的会计或司账审查，第三步交该厂店工人或店员审查，第四步交区工会办事处审查，第五步由市、区节约检查委员会审查。这样逐层审查完毕后，节约检查委员会即根据政务院通过的“北京市人民政府关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”分别进行处理。
    现在，各区工商户正开始重新填具表格。各区节约检查委员会鉴于各工商户在第一次填报时把表格拿回家去填写，有的便借故拖延，因此这次确定以工商户学习小组为单位集中填写，并由节约检查委员会派人指导，限定在半天到一天内填写完毕。然后由工商户学习小组审查，时间为一天。小组审查后即由学习小组长交各户会计审查，审查时间为半天。然后由会计交工人或店员审查，以后逐级上交。预计第一、二、三这三类工商户的处理，到本月二十日即可大体结束。
