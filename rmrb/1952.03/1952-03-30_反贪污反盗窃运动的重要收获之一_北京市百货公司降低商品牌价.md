One of the Important Gains of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Theft Movement
Beijing Department Stores Lower Commodity Prices

The Beijing Company of China Department Stores recently lowered the prices of 560 commodities, with the largest reduction being 20% and the average reduction being 5%. This is one of the important gains of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement. The price reductions for most of the commodities are due to the department store more accurately calculating production costs when processing orders and purchasing goods from private factories, thereby setting more reasonable prices.

In terms of processing, in the past, illegal capitalists falsely reported raw material consumption quotas to inflate costs and seek exorbitant profits. For example, a bundle of yarn could originally weave at least seven dozen and nine pairs of socks, but in the past, they falsely reported it as seven and a half dozen. A bundle of yarn could originally weave at least sixteen taels of towel eight dozen and eight pieces, but in the past, they falsely reported it as eight and a half dozen. To cover up their crimes of stealing materials and cutting corners, they deliberately added more starch when weaving, or mixed sand in the starch, or sprayed water on the socks when delivering goods to increase the output of the products. This not only inflated the price of the goods but also reduced the quality of the products. These acts of deception and theft by illegal capitalists are now beginning to be corrected.

In terms of ordering, prices have also been reduced for the same reasons. The price of paper recently ordered by the department store has been reduced by 20%, matches by 8.7%, and rubber shoes by 10%. In addition, the purchase prices of toothbrushes, soap, stationery, and other daily necessities have been reduced by 10% to 20% compared to the past. However, even with the price reductions, capitalists can still make a profit. For example, the prices of various candies ordered by the company from the New China Candy Factory have been reduced by an average of about 28% compared to the past, but the factory can still obtain at least 20% profit.

There are two main reasons why the department store can more accurately calculate costs. One is that it has purged the corrupt elements within the company who were sent in and pulled over by illegal capitalists, and the other is that the company itself has improved its business operations, especially by closely relying on the working class in its business dealings with private manufacturers. Recently, when the company signed processing and ordering contracts with private factories, it first obtained the help of the workers in the relevant factories, conducted thorough research with them, and then negotiated with the capitalists. The workers put forward many valuable opinions, and the new consumption quotas for various raw materials were calculated by the workers. Not only that, but because the workers clearly understood the specifications of the products in the contract, they were able to effectively supervise the production process. The quality of the new products recently received by the company has improved.

    反贪污反盗窃运动的重要收获之一
    北京市百货公司降低商品牌价
    中国百货公司北京市公司最近降低了五百六十种商品的牌价，最多的降低百分之二十，平均降低百分之五。这是反贪污反盗窃运动的重要收获之一。绝大部分商品的减价是由于百货公司在向私营工厂进行加工定货和收购时，比较确实地核算了生产成本，因而规定了比较合理的价格。
    在加工方面，过去违法资本家们虚报原材料消耗定额，以扩大成本，牟取暴利。如一捆纱本来至少可以织七打零九双袜子，但是过去他们虚报为七打半。一捆纱本来至少可以织十六两的毛巾八打零八条，但是过去他们虚报为八打半。为了掩盖他们这些偷工减料的罪行，他们在织造时故意多加浆水，或在浆水里搀砂子，或在交货时在袜子上喷水，以增加产品的产量。这样就不仅扩大了货品的价格，而且降低了产品的质量。违法资本家们的这些欺骗和盗窃行为现在开始得到纠正了。
    定货方面，现在也由于同样的原因而减低了价格。百货公司最近定购的纸张，价格减低了百分之二十，火柴减低了百分之八点七，胶鞋减低了百分之十。此外，牙刷、肥皂、文具和其他日用品的收购价格都比过去降低了百分之十到百分之二十。但是价格虽然降低，资本家们仍然有利可图。如该公司向新中国糖果工厂定购的各种糖果，订购价格比过去平均降低了百分之二十八左右，但该厂至少仍可以获得百分之二十的利润。
    百货公司所以能比较确实地计算成本，有两个主要原因。一个是清除了违法资本家们派进来和拉过去的公司内部的贪污分子，另一个原因是公司本身改进了业务，特别是在和私营厂商的业务往来中紧紧地依靠了工人阶级。最近该公司在和私营工厂签订加工定货合同时，都事先取得了有关工厂的职工们的帮助，和他们进行了缜密的研究，然后再和资方协商。职工们提出了很多宝贵的意见，各种原材料的新的消耗定额，都是职工们计算出来的。不仅如此，职工们由于清楚地了解了合同中产品的规格，在生产过程中，就能予以有效的监督。最近该公司收到的新的产品，质量都提高了。
