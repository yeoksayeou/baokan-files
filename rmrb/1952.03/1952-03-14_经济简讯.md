    Economic Briefs
    ▲ During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the Machine Six Factory of the Northeast Machinery Industry Bureau paid close attention to the "four preventions" work (fire prevention, anti-espionage, anti-theft, and air defense). As a result, no accidents occurred during the intense anti-corruption struggle in February, ensuring production safety.
    ▲ In the deepening stage of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, in addition to continuing to concentrate efforts on "tiger hunting," the People's Bank of China in Beijing, in order to strengthen its business and support production, has ordered its subordinate offices to immediately appoint dedicated personnel to oversee operations. It has also decided that, in addition to state-owned trade and cooperatives already supported through processing, ordering, and purchasing, the bank should continue to provide loans to support legitimate production businesses lacking production funds, based on the specific circumstances and actual needs of each household.
