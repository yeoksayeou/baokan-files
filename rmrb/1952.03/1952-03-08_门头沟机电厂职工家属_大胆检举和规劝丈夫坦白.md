    Family Members of the Mentougou Mechanical and Electrical Plant Bravely Report and Advise Their Husbands to Confess
    Editor: The family members of the employees of the Mentougou Mechanical and Electrical Plant of the Jingxi Mining Bureau have played a significant role in the anti-corruption struggle. At the beginning of the movement, the trade union immediately called on the family members of employees to bravely report and mobilize their relatives to confess. When Zheng Suying saw her husband, Li Baoshan, looking distracted and restless, she explained the government's policies to him and encouraged him to confess. As a result, Li Baoshan put down his burden and confessed his corruption problems. Yue Zhenhai had embezzled the wages of the odd-job workers. During the movement, he formed a "defense alliance" with other corrupt elements and refused to confess. After repeatedly trying to persuade him without success, his family member, Li Wenge, resolutely reported him to the trade union. As the movement gradually entered the stage of encircling and suppressing major corrupt elements, family members organized "tiger-fighting teams" and "propaganda groups" to cooperate with employees in fighting "tigers." Zhao Pilon, a purchasing agent in the factory's general affairs section, was a major corrupt element, but only confessed to embezzling one million yuan and then stopped talking. The "tiger-fighting team" and "propaganda group" went to Zhao's house, and based on the clues provided by Zhao's wife, they found the materials and finally forced Zhao to confess the fact that he had embezzled 240 million yuan. Shen Zhiguang, a cooperative employee, had unclean hands and a tough attitude, and did not admit to corruption, but with the help of his wife, he confessed to embezzling and accepting bribes of 60 million yuan.

    门头沟机电厂职工家属
    大胆检举和规劝丈夫坦白
    编辑同志：京西矿务局门头沟机电厂职工家属，在反贪污斗争中，起了很大作用。运动开始时，工会立即号召职工家属大胆检举，动员自己的亲属坦白。家属郑素英看见丈夫李宝山神情恍惚，坐立不安，就对他讲解政府政策，动员他坦白。李宝山因而放下包袱，交代了贪污问题。岳振海曾贪污过小工工资，在运动中和其他贪污分子订了“攻守同盟”，拒不坦白。他的家属李文阁在屡劝无效之后，毅然到工会检举了他。运动逐渐进入围剿大贪污分子的阶段，家属们组织了“打虎队”、“宣传组”，配合职工打“老虎”。厂里庶务股采购员赵丕纶是个大贪污分子，只交代了贪污一百万元的事情就不说了。“打虎队”和“宣传组”人员到赵的家里去，根据赵的老婆所说的线索，找到材料，终于迫使赵交代了贪污二亿四千万元的事实。合作社职员申志广手上不干净，态度又强硬，不承认贪污，但他在他老婆的帮助下，坦白出曾贪污受贿六千万元。        佟屏亚
