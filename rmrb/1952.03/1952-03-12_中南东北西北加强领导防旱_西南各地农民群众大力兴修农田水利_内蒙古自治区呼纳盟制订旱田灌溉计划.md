The spring plowing production and drought prevention work in the Central South region have been widely launched throughout the region. Production and drought prevention offices in provinces such as Henan and Jiangxi have been established one after another. Liu Yifeng, Vice Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, personally led a working group to Yuanzhou, Fuzhou, and other special districts to inspect and supervise spring plowing production and drought prevention work. The spring plowing inspection group organized by the Hunan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture has also gone to the countryside. In addition, Henan Province has called on farmers to hoe wheat and apply topdressing fertilizer, and Guangxi Province has called on farmers to prepare for spring plowing and spring sowing, striving to increase the province's total grain output by 100% compared to last year.

This year, the spring plowing preparations in various parts of Central South China have been successful. The winter plowing area in Hengyang Special District, Hunan Province, has more than doubled compared to the previous year. Many mutual aid groups throughout the province, having absorbed Li Chenggui's experience in high yield, broke through conservative ideas in agricultural production, formulated high-yield plans of over 1,000 catties per mu, and launched high-yield competitions.

To support farmers in spring plowing, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has issued spring plowing loans of more than 140 billion yuan. In areas of Jiangxi that suffered crop failures due to drought last year, the People's Government also issued huge amounts of relief funds to solve the spring famine difficulties for farmers, and helped farmers build 3,000 medium-sized water conservancy projects, purchase more than 13,000 head of draught cattle, and large quantities of fertilizers, seeds, farm tools, and pest control machinery.

The People's Governments of Liaodong, Rehe, Songjiang, Heilongjiang and other provinces in the Northeast region have all held special meetings to study production and drought prevention work. Now, various regions have put forward many drought prevention and drought resistance measures according to the characteristics of the local climate and terrain, and have already begun to take action. Liaodong and Rehe provinces, which have more water sources, proposed that mountainous areas can use melting snow and build ponds and dams on the mountains to accumulate peach blossom water, preparing to irrigate the land during spring plowing; in plain areas, farmers can be mobilized to dig wells together to make full use of groundwater. Along the river areas, farmers can be promptly mobilized to pull ice from the river. Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces, which have difficulties with water sources, proposed to prevent and resist drought by improving farming methods. For example, farmers should be mobilized to clean up various crop stubbles from last year during thawing, advance spring plowing, so that the cultivated soil is loose and can absorb more ground water. Mobilizing farmers to use more water to rot fertilizer, so that it is fully decomposed before being applied to the land, can avoid the consumption of a large amount of water in the ground by applying dry manure. Early sowing of wheat (when there is not much moisture lost in the soil after thawing), and more rolling and compaction of various crops after sowing (which can maintain soil moisture) are also effective ways to resist drought.

At present, water conservancy construction has become an important task for preparing for spring plowing in various parts of the Northeast.

The Northwest District Production and Drought Prevention Committee held a meeting on the 4th to discuss emergency measures for drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing. The meeting decided to strengthen the leadership of production and drought prevention work. The civil affairs, agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, banking, and cooperative departments will select nine cadres at the director level or above to participate in the production and drought prevention office, and at the same time select 80 cadres to organize seven inspection teams to go to various provinces to supervise and inspect drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing. Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, as well as some special districts, counties, districts, and townships, have successively established production and drought prevention committees and have begun work. Relevant departments in the Northwest District have formulated a preliminary plan to solve the difficulties faced by farmers in drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing. The plan first requires doing a good job in mobilizing farmers to build farmland water conservancy, so that 3.1 million mu of dry land in the entire region can be turned into irrigated land. In order to strive for high yield, the government plans to lend and promote 21,500 waterwheels, 143,700 new-style walking plows, repair 93,900 old farm tools, lend 5,000 tons of chemical fertilizer, 15,579 tons of plant fertilizer, 1,400 tons of pesticides, 16,180 sprayers and dusters, 5.3 million catties of improved varieties, and 3 million catties of seeds for famine preparedness. These production materials will be lent to farmers before May.

The Hulunbuir League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is stepping up drought prevention work. The Hulunbuir League and various banners have established production and drought prevention offices. The League People's Government also formulated a Hulunbuir League Dryland Irrigation Plan at an emergency meeting on drought prevention and drought resistance held at the end of February.

The Hulunbuir League Dryland Irrigation Plan stipulates that from the beginning of March to before spring plowing, the entire league should dig 2,141 wells; with each well irrigating 75 mu, more than 160,000 mu can be irrigated. At present, the entire league is mobilizing farmers to transport ice and accumulate snow, which can irrigate more than 158,000 mu of farmland. From Grain Rain to Lesser Fullness, the entire league will mobilize farmers to transport water and carry water, which can irrigate more than 142,000 mu of farmland. In addition, individual areas can also open canals to irrigate more than 5,000 mu of farmland. In total, 21.6% of the farmland in Hulunbuir League can be fully irrigated this year. If faced with the threat of drought, each farmer can strive to obtain a harvest of at least three mu of land.

Now, the Hulunbuir League People's Government has issued the first agricultural loan of 600 million yuan to help farmers in various banners purchase water conservancy tools and new-style farm tools. The Hulunbuir League Production and Drought Prevention Office has sent working groups to various banners to inspect and assist in carrying out drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing preparation work.

From October to December last year, the entire Southwest region built more than 15,000 small irrigation projects such as ponds, dams, and ditches, which can irrigate 700,000 mu of farmland.

The Southwest region is mostly hilly, with crisscrossing mountain streams and small rivers. Developing such small-scale farmland water conservancy projects with low cost, simple construction, and great benefits is the valuable experience of Southwest farmers in developing agricultural production over the generations. After the autumn harvest last year, the agricultural production departments of local people's governments convened water conservancy professional meetings, respectively, planning to newly build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects covering more than 3.3 million mu in the Southwest region this winter and spring, and to comprehensively renovate existing irrigation projects. The method is "publicly run with government assistance," with the government providing necessary loan support and technical guidance.

As soon as last winter began, a heated mass movement for farmland water conservancy construction formed among the farmers in the North Sichuan area. In one winter, 16,915 large and small ponds and 400 dams were built, expanding the irrigation area by more than 320,000 mu. In order to support farmers in various places in widely building small-scale water conservancy projects last winter, the West Sichuan District successively issued loans of 1.9 billion yuan. According to statistics, the entire West Sichuan District has now newly built 168 weirs and ponds, 96 water-blocking dams, dredged 34 springs, and renovated more than 1,200 old weirs and ponds. More than 400,000 laborers in the South Sichuan District have participated in the construction of water conservancy projects since last winter. Many water conservancy projects that have not been repaired for many years have been completed this time. Other examples include the Diwo Dam in Kaiyang County, Guizhou Province, a waterway that had not been repaired for more than ten years, was also repaired at the end of last year. This waterway can irrigate 1,330 mu of land, and can increase rice production by a total of 480,000 catties per year.

Currently, farmers in various parts of the Southwest are continuing to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. The area of irrigation projects that have already been surveyed in Tianquan, Ya'an, and Mianning counties in Xikang Province last year reached more than 90 square kilometers. After completion, they can irrigate more than 130,000 mu of farmland. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    中南东北西北加强领导防旱
    西南各地农民群众大力兴修农田水利
    内蒙古自治区呼纳盟制订旱田灌溉计划
    中南区的春耕生产和防旱抗旱工作已在全区普遍展开。河南、江西等省的生产防旱办公室都已先后成立。江西省人民政府副主席刘一峰亲自率领的工作组，已分赴袁州、抚州等专区检查并督促春耕生产和防旱抗旱工作。湖南省人民政府农业厅所组织的春耕考察团也已经下乡。此外，河南省已号召农民锄麦追肥，广西省已号召农民准备春耕春播，争取今年全省粮食总产量比去年增加一倍。
    今年中南各地的春耕准备工作都有成绩。湖南省衡阳专区去年冬耕面积较前年扩大了两倍以上。全省许多个互助组因为吸取了李承桂的丰产经验，打破了农业生产上的保守思想，订出每亩千斤以上的丰产计划，展开了丰产竞赛。
    为扶助农民春耕，江西省人民政府已贷放了春耕贷款一千四百多亿元。江西去年因旱歉收的地区，人民政府还发放了巨额的救济金，解决了农民的春荒困难，和帮助农民兴修了中型水利工程三千座，购进耕牛一万三千多头和大批的肥料、种籽、农具和灭虫药械等。
    东北区辽东、热河、松江、黑龙江等省人民政府，都已召开过专门会议，研究生产防旱工作。现在各地都已按照当地气候和地势的特点，提出了许多的防旱、抗旱办法，并已动起手来。水源较多的辽东、热河两省提出山区可以利用融雪，在山上修池塘、筑堤坝蓄积桃花水，准备春耕时浇地；平原地区可发动农民群众合伙打井，充分利用地下水。沿河地区，可及时地发动农民到河里拉冰。水源困难的松江、黑龙江两省提出从改进耕作方法上来防旱、抗旱。如发动农民在解冻时把去年的各种庄稼槎子刨捡干净，提早春耕，使耕地土壤疏松可以更多地吸收地面水分。发动农民多用水沤肥料，使之充分腐熟后再上地，这样可避免施用干粪大量消耗地里水分。小麦提早播种（解冻后土壤中的水分还消失不多），各种作物播种后多用磙子镇压（可以保持土中水分）也是抗旱的有效办法。
    目前，兴修水利已成为东北各地准备春耕的一项重要工作。
    西北区生产防旱委员会在四日召开会议，讨论对于防旱、抗旱、春耕的紧急措施。会议决定加强对生产防旱的领导工作，由民政、农林、水利、畜牧、银行、合作社等部门抽调处长级以上的干部九人，参加生产防旱办公室，同时抽调八十个干部组织七个检查组，到各省去督促和检查防旱、抗旱和春耕。陕西、甘肃两省以及部分专区、县、区、乡都先后成立了生产防旱委员会，并已开始工作。西北区各有关部门为了解决农民在防旱、抗旱和春耕工作中的困难，已拟定了一个初步计划。计划首先要求做好发动农民兴修农田水利的工作，使全区有三百一十万亩旱地变成水地。为了争取丰产，政府准备贷放和推广水车二万一千五百辆，新式步犁十四万三千七百部，增修旧农具九万三千九百件，贷发化学肥料五千吨，植物肥料一万五千五百七十九吨，农药一千四百吨，喷雾器和喷粉器一万六千一百八十架，良种五百三十万斤、备荒种籽三百万斤。这些生产资料，争取在五月前贷放到农民手中。
    内蒙古自治区的呼纳盟已在加紧开展防旱工作。呼纳盟和各旗都已成立了生产防旱办公室。盟人民政府并在二月底举行全盟的防旱、抗旱紧急会议上，制订了一个呼纳盟旱田灌溉计划。
    呼纳盟旱田灌溉计划规定：从三月上旬到春耕前，全盟要打井二千一百四十一眼；以每眼井浇地七十五亩计，可浇地十六万多亩。目前全盟发动农民运冰积雪，可润田十五万八千多亩。从谷雨到小满，全盟再发动农民运水、担水，可浇地十四万二千多亩。另外，个别地区还可开渠灌溉农田五千多亩。总计呼纳盟今年可有百分之二十一点六的农田得到充分的灌溉，如果遇到旱灾威胁，每一家农民最低能争取获得三亩地的收获。
    现在呼纳盟人民政府已发放了第一次农业贷款六亿元，帮助各旗农民置办水利工具和新式农具。呼纳盟生产防旱办公室已派出工作组，到各旗检查和协助开展防旱、抗旱和春耕准备工作。
    西南全区从去年十月到十二月共修筑了塘坝沟渠等小型灌溉工程一万五千多处，可浇灌农田七十万市亩。
    西南地区多为丘陵地带，山溪小河纵横交错，举办这种费用少、工程简单而收益大的小型农田水利，是西南农民历代发展农业生产的宝贵经验。去年秋收后，各地人民政府农业生产部门曾分别召开了水利专业会议，计划去冬今春在西南全区共新修灌溉三百三十多万亩的小型农田水利工程，并普遍整修旧有的灌溉工程。办法是“民办公助”，政府给予必要的贷款扶持和技术上的指导。
    去冬一开始，川北区农民兴修水利就形成了热烈的群众运动，一个冬天兴修了大小水塘一万六千九百一十五个、坝四百座，扩大了灌溉面积三十二万多亩。川西区去年冬天为扶助各地农民普遍兴修小型水利，前后发放了十九亿元的贷款。据统计现在川西全区已新修堰塘一百六十八个、堵水坝九十六条、浚泉三十四眼、整修旧堰塘一千二百多个。川南区去冬以来也有四十多万民工参加修水利工程。许多常年没有修好的水利工程，这次都修成了。其他如贵州开阳县底窝坝，十几年来都没有修好的一条水道，去年年底也修好了。这条水道可灌溉一千三百三十亩田，每年共可增产稻谷四十八万斤。
    目前西南各地农民正在继续兴修小型农田水利工程。西康省天全、雅安、冕宁等县去年已经勘察过的灌溉工程的面积就达九十多平方公里，修成后可灌田十三万多亩。（据新华社消息）
