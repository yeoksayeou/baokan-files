Many countries are stepping up preparations to participate in the conference.

	In Eastern Europe, newspapers and magazines in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania have recently published many articles by economic figures, supporting the holding of the International Economic Conference in Moscow. Preparatory committees in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Hungary, and other countries have held meetings to discuss the issue of participating in the Moscow conference. The Polish Preparatory Committee meeting has decided to expand the preparatory committee and has elected three specialized committees to be responsible for preparing documents for the Polish delegation to submit to the Moscow conference. The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences is scheduled to hold an economic conference on March 23. Mateev, Chairman of the State Planning Commission under the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, and others, will report on issues such as the possibility of expanding international trade.

According to French newspapers, the French business community will send a 25-member delegation to Moscow. West German bourgeois newspapers are paying increasing attention to the International Economic Conference and are expressing dissatisfaction with the American occupation authorities' monopoly of West German trade. Belgian Socialist Party Member of Parliament Blum advocates participating in the Moscow conference. She pointed out that to combat unemployment in Belgium's textile, glass, and footwear industries, it is necessary to trade with the East.
