The microbiologists I represent are deeply indignant at the heinous crimes of the American imperialists who launched germ warfare. They vehemently condemn the murderous criminals who call themselves scientists and who are serving the mortal enemies of human civilization and progress—the barbaric American imperialists. Scientists of the Romanian People's Republic demand that the heinous American murderers in Korea be given the most severe punishment."
