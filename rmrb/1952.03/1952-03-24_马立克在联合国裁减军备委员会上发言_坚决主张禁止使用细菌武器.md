Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations Disarmament Commission held a regular meeting on March 20th.

The representatives of Greece, Turkey, and the Netherlands, as well as a Kuomintang element, spoke successively. In their speeches, they merely echoed the American representative, clearly attempting to prevent the committee from discussing the main issues: the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, the reduction of armaments and armed forces, and the question of violations of the ban on bacteriological warfare and holding violators of the ban accountable for their actions. They demanded that the consideration of the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation regarding violations of the ban on bacteriological warfare, the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, and holding the violators of the ban on bacteriological warfare accountable for their actions be stopped. They insisted that while the committee was qualified to discuss this issue "in principle," it was not qualified to consider a "special" aspect of this issue, namely whether the US military used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

Soviet representative Malik then spoke. He said that it was not surprising that the representatives of those countries participating in the aggression against the Korean people so actively defended the US military's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. However, their unwarranted denials, like Acheson's statements on the matter, were unconvincing.

Malik pointed out that the Soviet delegation had put forward its own concrete proposal: "To consider the issue of violations of the ban on bacteriological warfare, the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, and holding the violators of the ban on bacteriological warfare accountable for their actions." The Soviet delegation would most actively participate in the consideration of this issue, making resolutions to take measures to prevent the use of bacteriological weapons and hold the violators of the ban on bacteriological warfare accountable for their actions, so as to implement this ban. Malik emphasized that the Soviet delegation firmly demanded that this issue be considered in the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which is qualified to consider it, and demanded that the committee pass appropriate resolutions to prohibit the use of bacteriological weapons and hold the violators of the ban on bacteriological warfare accountable for their actions.

It is particularly noteworthy that the US monopoly newspapers have in fact remained silent about the Soviet representative's speech and the Soviet proposals. In the lounge of the United Nations, it was pointed out that the US delegation had instructed American reporters to remain silent about the Soviet proposals.

### 马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会上发言  坚决主张禁止使用细菌武器

    马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会上发言
    坚决主张禁止使用细菌武器
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国裁减军备委员会三月二十日举行例会。
    希腊、土耳其和荷兰代表以及一个国民党分子相继发言。他们在发言中只是做美国代表的应声虫，显然企图使委员会不去讨论主要的问题——禁止大规模毁灭性的武器、裁减军备和武装部队以及关于违反细菌战禁令并使细菌战禁令的违反者对其行为负责的问题。他们要求停止审议苏联代表团所提出的关于违反细菌战禁令、关于禁止使用细菌武器以及关于使细菌战禁令的违反者对其行为负责的问题。他们硬说：委员会虽然有资格在“原则上”讨论这个问题，却没有资格审议这个问题的一个“特殊的”方面，即美军在朝鲜和中国是否使用细菌武器。
    苏联代表马立克接着发言。他说：参加侵略朝鲜人民的那些国家的代表这么积极地替在朝鲜与中国使用细菌武器的美军辩解，那是毫不奇怪的。然而，他们毫无理由的否认，正和艾奇逊关于这件事的声明一样是不能令人信服的。
    马立克指出：苏联代表团已提出了自己的具体建议：“审议关于违反细菌战禁令、禁止使用细菌武器以及关于使细菌战禁令的违反者对其行为负责的问题。”苏联代表团将最积极地参加审议这个问题，作出决议，以便采取措施来防止使用细菌武器，使细菌战禁令的违反者对其行为负责，以贯彻这项禁令。马立克强调说：苏联代表团坚决要求在有资格审议这个问题的联合国裁减军备委员会中审议这个问题，并且要求委员会通过适当的决议，禁止使用细菌武器，使细菌战禁令的违反者对其行为负责。
    美国的垄断报纸事实上都对苏联代表的发言和苏联的提案保持缄默，这是值得特别注意的。联合国会场休息室中有人指出：美国代表团曾吩咐美国各报记者，对苏联的建议保持缄默。
