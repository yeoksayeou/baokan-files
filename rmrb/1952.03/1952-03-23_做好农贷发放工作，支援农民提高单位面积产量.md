    Do a Good Job in Issuing Agricultural Loans to Support Farmers in Increasing Yield Per Unit Area
    Jiang Xia
    The Central People's Government has decided to allocate 1 trillion yuan in agricultural loans to various parts of the country in 1952 (excluding large-scale water conservancy construction and fertilizer loans). This measure is of great significance for increasing agricultural yield per unit area this year. However, in order to ensure that these loans fully play their due role, the cadres responsible for issuing agricultural loans, as well as the agriculture, water conservancy, cooperation departments, and local leaders at all levels, must work together diligently and meticulously.
    First, it is necessary to struggle against certain erroneous ideas held by some cadres and farmers regarding agricultural loan work.
    Based on past experiences in loan work, some cadres have some misconceptions about agricultural loans. Some hold a patronage view and distribute loans using an egalitarian approach. For example, in Liangmei Village, Bobai County, Guangxi Province, 800,000 yuan in loans were evenly distributed among 70 farming households last year. In Qijiang County, Eastern Sichuan, loans for jute seeds were issued at one jin per household, valued at several thousand yuan. In Wanzai County, Jiangxi, when handling water conservancy loans, all nine districts in the county received loans, with some projects receiving only 60,000 yuan. The result of issuing loans in this "light rain for all" manner is the dispersion of funds and waste of loans. Some cadres have the idea of "treating loans as relief"; when recovering loans, some cadres even refuse to accept the loans returned by farmers. This one-sided "mass line" is extremely wrong. In addition, a small number of cadres in various places have a purely task-oriented view. They emphasize "borrowers must have the ability to repay," and they actually distribute loans to rich peasants; some even lend to merchants. This practice is actually a manifestation of serious right-leaning thought. All these erroneous ideas must be criticized and corrected.
    Based on the past situation of issuing agricultural loans in various places, the phenomenon of borrowers arbitrarily misappropriating and wasting loans is widespread. For example, last year, the deputy village chief and militia captain of Xueguantun Village, Cang County, Hebei, borrowed 700,000 yuan for a cart loan, but after receiving the loan, they did not buy a cart and each divided 350,000 yuan to buy grain; when the People's Bank went to inspect, they borrowed a cart from others to deceive them. In individual areas, some even took the received loans and engaged in usury to seek exorbitant profits. The phenomenon of borrowers collectively misappropriating loans also exists. To solve this problem, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for the masses on the one hand, and strengthen pre-loan investigation, loan-time review, and post-loan inspection work through the masses on the other hand. This is the key to whether the loan can be truly used to support and develop agricultural production. Some areas have already gained some experience in this regard. When Daxing County, Hebei, issued livestock loans in September 1950, they first studied the loan recipients with the district and village cadres, and then convened the farmers who requested loans to conduct democratic evaluation based on the loan conditions, and finally determined the loan households. Because sufficient investigation and research work was done in advance, good results were achieved. When the Leting Sub-branch of the People's Bank of Hebei issued fishing loans in January last year, they discussed the review methods democratically through the masses. With the supervision of the masses, the loans could be distributed more reasonably and play their due role. After the loans were issued, it was particularly important to inspect and supervise the use of the loans. When the Leting Sub-branch inspected the use of the loans, it found that eight loan households had misappropriated part of the loans, and the sub-branch promptly recovered the misappropriated part.
    We must ensure that agricultural loans are used in the most appropriate places.
    This year's agricultural loans should focus on areas with a high degree of commercialization of grain and economic crop areas. Loan issuing agencies at all levels, especially the loan issuing agencies in large administrative regions and provinces, should fully investigate and study the economic characteristics and agricultural production conditions of the loan issuing areas in order to use the loans reasonably. Last year, some agencies issuing agricultural loans did not understand the situation in the loan issuing areas, so the plans they formulated were not realistic and lacked overall planning. This resulted in many loans failing to play their due role. We should learn from this lesson in the future.
    This year, the government stipulates that agricultural loans should be mainly used for building small-scale water conservancy projects, purchasing medicine and machinery for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, breeding livestock, and new-style agricultural tools, which creates a favorable condition for improving agricultural technology. All localities must earnestly grasp this principle in issuing loans. The most important material guarantee for increasing crop yields is fertilizer and water conservancy. This year, there are special loans for fertilizer; for general agricultural loans, special attention must be paid to using them for building small-scale farmland water conservancy. In addition, attention should be paid to closely integrating the issuance of agricultural loans with the improvement of agricultural technology. For example, in Yugan County, Jiangxi, last year, under the leadership of the "Agricultural Loan Committee," a cotton and hemp promotion work team was organized, divided into general affairs, technology, pest control, and agricultural loan sections, respectively, to handle seed storage, transportation, cultivation technology guidance, pest control, and agricultural loan matters, which played a significant role in increasing the production of cotton and hemp.
    In order to maximize the effectiveness of agricultural loans, attention should also be paid to promoting and encouraging farmers to establish production cooperative mutual aid organizations during the issuance. Hebei Province offers a 2% interest rate reduction for loans to mutual aid teams. Last year, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi and other places adopted the method of "joint loan, joint raising, and joint use" for cattle loans, so that the same amount of loans concentratedly solved the difficulties of more people. Promoting and encouraging farmers to organize production mutual aid through loans can not only give full play to the role of loans, but also educate farmers and point out the correct direction for agricultural production.
    Agricultural production is currently undergoing recovery and development, and it needs a large amount of capital investment. Obviously, relying solely on national loan assistance is far from meeting this requirement. One of the ways to solve the problem of insufficient agricultural production funds is to promote free (credit) lending in rural areas and encourage private banks and firms in cities to invest. Last year, the Subei District achieved great results in carrying out free lending. The masses reflected: "Free lending has opened up the long-clogged dam, and it can circulate in the future." Last spring, various parts of Shanxi Province helped the masses increase 1,500 livestock and 4,000 farm tools through credit cooperatives. Some areas have already attached importance to encouraging private banks and firms to invest in rural areas. Last year, Suzhou and Wuxi absorbed 2 billion yuan each from private banks and firms to invest in agriculture, and the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank led private financial institutions to lend 6 billion yuan to invest in rice production. Although these numbers are still small, they have opened up a new source of funds for agricultural production, which is worth promoting in various places.
    Agricultural lending is an arduous and complex task. Past experience has proven that it is not possible to do this work well by relying solely on banks for lending. Various departments related to agricultural lending, such as agriculture, water conservancy, and cooperation departments, should cooperate closely and divide their work appropriately under unified organizational leadership in order to do this work well. The Northwest and Central South provinces have absorbed personnel from various departments to establish specialized agricultural loan organizations - "Agricultural Loan Committees" - to be responsible for loan planning and distribution. Jiangxi Province established "Agricultural Loan Committees" in various counties, led by the main cadres of the county, to be responsible for determining loan areas, distributing loan amounts, and transporting materials. The "Agricultural Loan Committees" in Nancheng and Xingguo counties in Jiangxi Province completed their loan plans ahead of schedule in the first half of last year. Although the situation varies from region to region, strengthening unified leadership and clarifying the division of labor are applicable to all regions.

    做好农贷发放工作，支援农民提高单位面积产量
    江夏
    中央人民政府已决定一九五二年拨给全国各地农业贷款一万亿元（不包括大型水利修建和肥料贷款）；这个措施对于今年提高农业单位面积产量有很重要的意义。但是，要使这些贷款充分发挥它们应有的作用，贷放农业贷款的干部和农业、水利、合作等部门和地方上的各级领导干部，还须协同一致，作许多艰苦的细致的工作。
    首先，要对某些干部和农民在农贷工作上的错误思想进行斗争。
    根据过去在贷款工作中所发现的情况，某些干部对农贷工作是有些错误看法的。有的人有恩赐观点，用平均主义的分配方法发放贷款。如广西省博白县良美村，去年以八十万元贷款平均分配给七十户农民。川东綦江县发放黄麻种籽贷款，平均每户一斤，折价几千元。江西万载县办理水利贷款时，全县九个区都贷放了，每一座工程有只贷放六万元的。用这种“普降小雨”的方式贷放的结果，分散了资金，浪费了不少贷款。有些干部有“赈贷不分”的思想；在收回贷款时，有的干部竟拒绝收受农民送还的贷款。这种片面的“群众观点”是极其错误的。此外，各地也有少数干部有单纯任务观点。他们强调“贷户要有还款能力”，他们竟把贷款分配给富农；有的甚至贷给商人。这种做法，实际上是严重的右倾思想的表现。对所有这些错误思想，都必须批判纠正。
    根据过去各地发放农贷的情况来看，贷户随便挪用和浪费贷款的现象是普遍存在的。例如去年河北沧县薛官屯副村长和民兵队长两家伙贷了大车款七十万元，贷到后没有买车，每人平均分了三十五万元糴了粮食；人民银行去检查时，他俩借了别人的大车顶名欺骗。个别地区甚至有把领到的贷款转手放高利贷牟取暴利的。贷户集体挪用贷款的现象也有。要解决这个问题，就必须一方面加强对群众的思想教育工作，一方面通过群众，加强贷前调查、贷时审查、贷后检查工作。这是能不能把贷款真正用于扶植和发展农业生产的重要关键。有些地区在这方面已经取得了一些经验。河北大兴县在一九五零年九月发放牲畜贷款时，就先和区、村干部在一起研究了发放对象，然后召集请求贷款的农民，根据贷款条件，进行民主评议，最后确定了贷款户。因为事前做了充分的调查研究工作，所以收到了良好的效果。河北乐亭银行支行在去年一月份发放渔贷时，通过群众，民主讨论了审查的办法。有了群众的监督，就使贷款能够更合理地分配，发挥它应有的作用。在贷放后，对于贷款用途进行检查和监督是特别重要的。乐亭支行在检查贷款用途时，发现有八个贷款户曾挪用一部分贷款，支行就及时把挪用部分收回。
    我们一定要保证把农业贷款用到最适当的地方。
    今年的农业贷款贷放地区，应当着重在粮食商品化程度较高的地区和经济作物区。各级贷放机关，特别是大行政区和省的贷放机关，要充分调查和研究发放贷款地区的经济特点和农业生产情况，以便合理地使用贷款。去年有些地区发放农贷的机关对贷放地区情况不够了解，因而订出的计划是不切合实际的，缺乏通盘打算的。这就使不少贷款未能发挥应有的作用。今后应记取这个教训。
    今年政府规定农业贷款用途以兴修小型水利、购置防治病虫害药械、种畜和新式农具为主，这就给提高农业技术创造了一个有利条件。各地在发放贷款中必须认真掌握这个原则。增加农作物产量的最重要的物质保证就是肥料和水利。今年肥料有专门贷款；对一般的农贷，就必须特别注意用于兴修小型农田水利。此外，要注意把农贷的发放和提高农业技术紧密结合起来。如江西余干县，去年在“农贷委员会”领导下，组织了棉麻推广工作队，下分总务、技术、防虫、农贷四股，分别办理种籽存储、调运、栽培技术指导、病虫害防治及农贷事宜，对棉、麻的增产起了很大作用。
    为了发挥农贷的最大效用，在发放中还应当注意促进和鼓励农民建立生产合作互助组织。河北省对互助组贷款有让息二厘的优待。去年河南、湖南、江西等地对耕牛贷款采用了“伙贷、伙养、伙用”的方法，使同样数量的贷款集中地解决了更多人的困难。通过贷款促进和鼓励农民组织生产互助，不仅可以充分发挥贷款的作用，而且也可以教育农民，给他们指出农业生产的正确发展方向。
    农业生产目前正在进行恢复和发展，是需要投放大量资金的。很显然，单靠国家的贷款扶助，还远不能满足这个要求。解决农业生产资金不足的办法之一就是提倡农村中的自由（信用）借贷，和鼓励城市的私营行庄投资。苏北区去年在开展自由借贷中曾经做出很大成绩。群众反映：“自由借贷开通了多年淤塞的坝，今后可以流通了。”山西省各地去年春天通过信用合作社贷款，帮助群众增加了一千五百头牲畜和四千件农具。在鼓励私营行庄向农村投资方面，有些地区已经重视。去年苏州、无锡两地各吸收了二十亿元私营行庄的贷款投入了农业，人民银行天津分行领导私营金融业贷放了六十亿元投入稻田生产。这些数目虽然还不多，但已开辟了农业生产资金的一个新来源，值得各地推广。
    农业贷款是一件繁重复杂的工作。过去的经验证明，单靠银行进行贷放是不能做好这个工作的。与农业贷放有关的各部门，如农业、水利、合作等部门，在统一的组织领导之下，密切配合，适当分工，才能把这个工作做好。西北、中南各省曾吸收各部门人员设立农业贷款的专门组织——“农贷委员会”，负责贷款的计划和分配。江西省各县普遍成立过“农贷委员会”，由县的主要干部领导，负责确定贷区、分配贷额、调运实物等工作。江西省南城、兴国两县的“农贷委员会”，去年上半年都提前完成了贷放计划。各个地区情况虽有不同，但加强统一领导和明确分工是各地都适用的。
