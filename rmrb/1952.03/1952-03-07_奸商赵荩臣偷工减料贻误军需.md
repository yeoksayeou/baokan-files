    Unscrupulous Merchant Zhao Jinchen Skimps on Materials and Delays Military Supplies
    Comrade Editor: A certain military department entrusted Beijing Judehou in February of last year to process 12,000 sheets of oiled paper. This batch of processed oiled paper was to be used for packaging certain machine parts and hardware tools. The department packed the machine parts and sent them to the front lines, only to discover that the quality of the oil was too poor. The paper packages were full of water droplets, causing more than 25,000 machine parts and tools, both large and small, to rust completely, rendering them unusable. To remove the rust, the military department spent more than six hundred workdays and a lot of materials; the service life of the machine parts and tools was still shortened, which is an incalculable loss.

    When this problem was discovered, the military department immediately notified the manager of the firm, Zhao Jinchen, to handle it properly. Zhao, however, was cunning and sophistical, claiming that it was not the oil quality that was bad, but rather improper storage. He irrationally evaded responsibility many times. During the anti-bribery and anti-skimping-on-materials movement, the military department sent people to conduct tests, which proved that it was indeed the result of skimping on materials. Only then did the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Jinchen bow his head and confess his crime. It turned out that he was not using tung oil for processing, but rather using soybean oil and sesame oil instead. This time, the unscrupulous merchant not only sought exorbitant profits by skimping on materials, but also directly affected the completion of military tasks. I demand that the government punish the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Jinchen according to the law.

### 奸商赵荩臣偷工减料贻误军需

    奸商赵荩臣偷工减料贻误军需
    编辑同志：某军事部门在去年二月间委托北京聚德厚加工油纸一万二千张。这批加工油纸是用于包装某项机件及五金工具的。该部包好机件送往前方，发现油的质量太坏，纸包里全是水珠，使大小两万五千多件机件及工具，全部生锈，不能使用。为了消除锈迹，某军事部门化了六百多个工和许多材料；机件、工具的使用年限仍然缩短了，这是难以计算的损失。
    当发现这个问题时，某军事部门即通知该号经理赵荩臣妥为处理。赵一味狡猾诡辩，说这不是油料不好，而是存放不当。好多次都被他无理地推诿过去了。在反行贿、反偷工减料运动中，某军事部门派人进行试验，确实证明这是偷工减料的结果。至此，奸商赵荩臣才俯首认罪。原来他不是用桐油加工，而是用苏油及麻油来代替的。奸商这次偷工减料，不只谋得了暴利，也直接影响了军事任务的完成。我要求政府依法惩办奸商赵荩臣。
