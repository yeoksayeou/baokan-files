Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: News from Tokyo: People from all walks of life in Japan continue to oppose the humiliating US-Japan "Administrative Agreement."

Takano Minoru, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which has approximately three million members, said: With the signing of the "Administrative Agreement," Japan has embarked on the path of rearmament. He pointed out: "The time has come for the people of Japan to resist the military rule of the United States and fight for the nation."

Kitamura Tokutaro, Chairman of the Policy Committee of the Kaishinto (Progressive Party), said that the signing of the "Administrative Agreement" is a "tragedy for Japan." This agreement "harbors the danger of inducing interference in (Japan's) internal affairs in the future." Kitamura Tokutaro also criticized Yoshida for attempting to distort the Japanese Constitution and rapidly rearm Japan in order to fulfill his promise as a loyal servant of the United States.

Hikomatsu Kamikawa, a Japanese international law expert and former professor at the University of Tokyo, expressed his opinion at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Diet on the 12th, saying that according to the "Administrative Agreement," Japan is being treated as a colony. He pointed out: The "Administrative Agreement" and the agreement between France and the Bao Dai puppet regime are a "similar situation." He also said: The provisions of the "Administrative Agreement" regarding granting the United States military bases and extraterritorial rights in Japan are something for which "one cannot find a similar situation except in cases like the Philippines."

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Late news from Tokyo: The Japan-China Friendship Association held its first board meeting of 1952 on February 1st. The meeting decided to hold the Japan-China Friendship Association National Congress around April 10th and strive to hold an exhibition related to Asian nations in Tokyo around May. The meeting resolved that the current focus of the Japan-China Friendship Association's work is to establish and strengthen local branches and expand the scale of the Japan-China Friendship Association to all levels of the Japanese people. The meeting welcomed the International Economic Conference to be held in Moscow and decided to assist in promoting Sino-Japanese trade as much as possible.

According to the decision of the meeting, the Japan-China Friendship Association Board of Directors issued a statement on February 10, denouncing Yoshida for sending a letter to Dulles guaranteeing Japan's separate peace with the Kuomintang remnants (Taiwan bandits). The statement said: Yoshida's letter violated the will of the Japanese people and placed the Japanese economy in a state of long-term isolation from the neighboring great power (People's Republic of China). The statement pointed out: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China represents 500 million Chinese people and represents the Chinese people who have suffered from the aggression of Japanese militarism. The Japanese government cannot deny the responsibility and obligation to conclude peace with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The statement finally emphasized that: The significance of Yoshida's letter is equivalent to denying Japan's war responsibility to China and is an act of challenging the entire Chinese people. We stand on the position of friendship between the Japanese and Chinese people and will unanimously oppose this act of Yoshida.

    日本进步人士纷纷发表谈话
    反对美日“行政协定”
    日中友协斥吉田与台匪单独媾和
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：日本各界人士继续反对丧权辱国的美日“行政协定”。
    拥有会员约三百万人的日本工会总评议会的事务局长高野实说：签订了“行政协定”，日本就走上了重新武装的道路。他指出：“日本全国人民反抗美国的军事统治、为民族而斗争的时候已经到了。”
    改进党政策委员会主席北村德太郎说：“行政协定”的签订是“日本的悲剧”。这个协定“暗藏着将来会诱致干涉（日本）内政的危险”。北村德太郎并斥责吉田为了履行作为美国忠实奴仆的诺言，正企图歪曲日本宪法，迅速重新武装日本。
    日本国际法专家、前东京大学教授神川彦松十二日在国会外务委员会发表意见说：根据“行政协定”，日本是被当作殖民地的。他指出：“行政协定”和法国与保大傀儡之间的协定是一种“相同的情况”。他又说：“行政协定”关于给予美国以日本的军事基地和治外法权的规定，“除了像菲律宾这种情形以外，找不到相同的情形”。
    【新华社十五日讯】东京迟到消息：日中友好协会在二月一日召开一九五二年度第一次理事会。会议决定在四月十日左右举行日中友协全国大会，并争取在五月前后在东京举行有关亚洲民族的展览会。会议决议：日中友协的当前工作重点是建立和加强地方支部，并把日中友协的规模扩大到日本人民的各个阶层中去。会议欢迎将在莫斯科举行的国际经济会议，并决定尽可能地协助促进中日贸易。
    根据会议的决定，日中友协理事会在二月十日发表声明，斥责吉田致函杜勒斯保证日本与国民党残匪单独媾和。声明说：吉田的信违背了日本人民的意志，并把日本经济长期地置于与邻邦大国（中华人民共和国）隔绝的状态中。声明指出：中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表着五万万中国人民，代表着曾经遭受过日本军国主义进行侵略所造成的苦难的中国人民。日本政府是不可能否认与中华人民共和国中央人民政府媾和的责任与义务的。声明最后强调说：吉田的信的意义等于否定日本对中国的战争责任，是向中国全体人民挑战的行为。我们站在日、中两国人民友好的立场，要一致反对吉田的这一行为。
