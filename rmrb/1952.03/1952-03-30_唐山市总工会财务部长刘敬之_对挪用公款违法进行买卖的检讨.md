    Tangshan City Federation of Trade Unions Finance Department Head Liu Jingzhi
    Self-Criticism for Misappropriating Public Funds for Illegal Trading
    Editor: The criticism from readers published in the People's Daily on February 25th regarding my misappropriation of public funds for illegal activities is accurate. Last year, the leadership of the Tangshan City Federation of Trade Unions approved my use of 200 to 300 million yuan from the workers' hospital construction fund for production, but I independently used 680 million yuan. I gave 200 million yuan to Li Ming, the manager of the Workers' Clothing Factory, for him to engage in fur processing and oil pressing in Zunhua. I invested a portion of the funds in the Liqun Native Produce Trading Company, a production entity under the Qinhuangdao Municipal People's Government, to transport 300 tons of pig iron. I used a portion of the funds to sell 2,800 bolts of homespun cloth, evading taxes of approximately 9 million yuan. Without approval, I lent 50 million yuan to the Qiming Factory (a joint public-private enterprise), and without principle, I used 4.9 million yuan in interest to subsidize the operating expenses of the City Federation of Trade Unions. After being criticized, I realized that this was a serious error of losing my position. In fact, I colluded with capitalists to deceive the state bank and disrupt the currency management system. As for the matter of lending 40 bolts of cloth to the Workers' Clothing Factory, it was done with the approval of the leadership. It is understood that the factory has already recorded this in its accounts.
    The main reason for the above serious mistakes is that my position was unstable, and my bourgeois ideology was never properly reformed, leading to violations of laws and discipline, which seriously damaged the Party's prestige among the masses. Due to my bureaucratic work style, the personnel of the business organization I led committed serious errors of corruption and perversion of justice. I should receive the strictest punishment. I am determined to correct my mistakes and atone for my crimes by performing meritorious service in future work.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    唐山市总工会财务部长刘敬之
    对挪用公款违法进行买卖的检讨
    编辑同志：二月二十五日人民日报刊登了读者对我挪用公款进行违法活动的批评，这个批评是真实的。去年，唐山市总工会领导方面批准我动用工人医院建筑基金二亿到三亿元，进行生产，而我擅自动用了六亿八千万元。我把二亿元交给工人被服厂经理李铭，由他在遵化搞皮毛加工及榨油业务。我把一部分款子投入秦皇岛市人民政府机关生产利群土产贸易行，贩运生铁三百吨。我用一部分款子贩卖了土布二千八百匹，偷税漏税约九百万元。我不经批准，贷给启明工厂（公私合营）五千万元，又毫无原则地以利息四百九十万元贴补市总工会的经费开支。我受到批评后，才认识这是犯了失掉立场的严重错误，事实上，我是与资本家合谋欺骗了国家银行，破坏了货币管理制度。至于借给工人被服厂四十匹布的事，是经过领导批准的。据了解，这个厂在账上已有记载。
    造成以上严重错误的原因，主要是我立场不稳，我的资产阶级思想始终没有得到很好的改造，以致发展到违反法纪的地步，严重地损害了党在群众中的威信；由于我有官僚主义作风，所以，我所领导的经营机关生产的人员，发生了严重的贪污枉法的错误。我应受到最严格的处分，我决心改正错误，在今后工作中立功赎罪。
        唐山市总工会财务部长  刘敬之
