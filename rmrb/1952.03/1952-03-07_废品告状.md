Scrap Materials Complain

Hong Guanglie

The year 1952 began with a resounding voice from the people's capital: Launch a vigorous and swift campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy! This is the battle cry of our great leader, Chairman Mao. Subsequently, the movement swept across the country like a storm, also stirring up our Fengfeng Coal Mine.

"Help! Help! I've become scrap! I'm so wronged, imprisoned here for years!" The materials stockpiled in the Fengfeng Mining Bureau's warehouse roared like a volcanic eruption. Boilers, pig iron, steel plates, small locomotives, etc., lying on both sides of the road, also cried out in the same way. The small locomotive, covered in scars and pockmarks, saw its master coming and, thinking it was going to be repaired, said with a bitter smile: "I was dragged here from Liuhegou by many people from the Fengfeng Coal Mine in 1946. During the war, I went up the mountain from here, and in 1947, I came down the mountain again. Since then, I've been abandoned here, with no one caring for me. I've suffered five years of wind, rain, and sun. Children crawl in and out of my body, which has been ruined like this, screws rusted, parts lost! Masters, quickly save me!" People hurried towards the warehouse, some squinting as if to say: "A little waste is nothing, stockpiling materials isn't a big problem, better safe than sorry..."

The small locomotive saw this look and continued to shout: "You know, I was still new when I got here! My masters! Are you going to continue to make me suffer? Or will you let me go out to cross the Yellow River and the Yangtze River to contribute to the people of the motherland?" People were busy inspecting the warehouse and went inside before it finished complaining. Ah, what a big "department store"! So many materials, all kinds of machine tools are placed here. Steam winches, electric winches, electric motors of all sizes, water pumps, and also flour mills, electric mills, vacuum cleaners... too many to count. At this time, a rumbling sound came from the vast room, some materials saying: "I can be used as soon as I'm taken out." Some said: "I'm still a good machine if I'm fitted with some parts." Some said: "Bureaucracy has harmed us; we were all strong and healthy, but being placed here, we're slowly turning into iron oxide." One raised its voice particularly loudly and shouted: "If we turn these materials into working capital, we can build half of another Fengfeng Coal Mine! We are worth more than 70 billion yuan in total, enough to buy 35,000 tons of millet." It shouted aggressively: "Have we broken the law? Why are we imprisoned here year after year, not allowed to go out and work? We want to increase production, we want to resist America and aid Korea, we want to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Whoever unreasonably imprisons us is a criminal of the motherland..."

A DC generator also spoke: "I was thrown here in 1946. At that time, I was still a young man. I was full of energy, new inside and out, agile, and worked very well. Unfortunately, I was thrown here, suffered from dampness and dust, and now my blood vessels are blocked, like having a serious illness. Is this 'better safe than sorry,' or is it blatant and open sabotage?"

However, these indignant and righteous voices did not fully awaken all the people.

In January 1952, as soon as the contract for the power plant's equipment was signed, the budget was supplemented again. When asked the person in charge: "Are the stockpiled materials not going to be used?" They said: "Not sure." Production quotas must be confirmed, but whether the stockpiled materials will be used is "not sure." What kind of thinking is this? It is to make up one’s mind to stockpile materials and create scrap. In addition, many units supplement their budgets five or six times a day. Some even hold the budget in their right hand and ask for materials with their left, replacing "planned economy" with the four words "urgent task." They don't cherish state property, and they don't consider how much waste is caused by stockpiled materials. Even the Fengfeng Mining Hospital has learned it; last October, it also urgently bought 1.5 billion yuan of equipment and put it in the warehouse. The Mining Bureau's funds are insufficient, so it borrowed 10 billion yuan from the bank, begging for food while holding a gold mine, and not using the equipment even as it turns into iron oxide. The Fengfeng Mining Bureau's "better safe than sorry" mentality and bureaucratic style have forced the scrap materials to speak. Their unanimous voice: "We want to be rehabilitated in this movement and judge those bureaucrats who unreasonably imprison us!"

    废品告状
    洪光烈
    一九五二年元旦，从人民首都传来了一个响亮的声音：大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地开展反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动！这是中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席的战斗号召。接着运动像暴风骤雨似地在全国开展起来了，也掀动了我们峰峰煤矿。
    “救命啊！救命啊！我成废品啦！我好冤屈呀，长年囚禁在这里！”峰峰矿务局仓库积压的器材像火山爆发一样地怒吼起来了。躺在道路两旁的锅炉、元铁、铁板、小火车头等也同样呼号着。全身净是斑疤，脸上生满了麻子的小火车头看见主人来了，他以为要修理他，就含酸带笑地说：“我是一九四六年峰峰煤矿用许多人马由六河沟拉到这里的，战争时期从这里上了山，一九四七年又下了山。从那时起就把我丢在这里没人管啦。我整整受了五年的风吹、雨打、太阳晒的罪。小孩子在我身躯里钻来钻去，身体已糟踏成这样破烂，镙丝锈住啦，零件丢失啦！主人们哪，快救救我呀！”人们匆匆地走向仓库，有的人瞬着眼睛，好像在说：“浪费点没什么，积压器材也不算什么大毛病，有备无患，……”
    小火车头看出了这种眼色，它又继续高喊：“你们知道吧，我到这里，还像新的呢！我的主人哪！你们还是叫我继续受罪呢？还是放我出去跨黄河、过长江，给祖国人民出力呢？”人们忙着到仓库里检查，没有等他诉完苦，就走到仓库里去了。呀，这么大的“百货公司”！这样多的器材，各式各样的工作母机都在这儿摆着呢。汽绞车、电绞车、大大小小的电动机，水泵，还有火磨机、电磨机、吸尘机……数都数不清。这时广阔的屋里发出轰轰的声音，有的器材说：“我现在拿出去就能使用。”有的说：“我添配一下零件也是好机器。”有的说：“官僚主义坑害了我们，我们本来都是身强力壮的，把我们放在这里慢慢都变成氧化铁了。”有一个特别提高嗓音叫起来：“如果把我们这些器材变成流动资金，可以再办半个峰峰煤矿！我们总起来值七百多亿元呀，能买小米三万五千吨。”它气势汹汹地叫着：“我们犯了法啦？为什么成年累月地把我们囚禁在这里，不叫我们出去干活呢？我们要增产，我们要抗美援朝、我们要支持中国人民志愿军。谁无理囚禁我们，谁就是祖国的罪人……”
    一架直流发电机也开腔了：“我一九四六年被抛到这里，那时我还是个年青小伙子哪，我精神饱满，里外如新，动作灵活，干活还很好呢。不幸把我抛到这里，受潮湿、遭尘袭，到现在血脉不通啦，像得了重病。这是‘有备无患’呢，还是明目张胆的、公开的破坏呢？”
    但是，这些愤激的、正义的声音，并没有完全震醒所有的人们。
    一九五二年一月份电厂的器材合同刚订好就又追加预算，问负责人：“积压的器材是不是不用了呢？”他们说：“不肯定。”生产定额要肯定，器材积压着要不要用，却“不肯定”，这是什么思想呢？是下定决心积压器材，制造废品。另外，许多单位追加预算的每天有五、六件。还有的右手拿预算，左手要材料，以“紧急任务”四个字，代替了“计划经济”。不珍惜国家资财，不考虑积压器材造成了多大浪费。连峰峰矿医院都学会了，去年十月份也急买十五亿元的器材，放在仓库里。矿务局资金不足，就向银行贷款一百亿元，抱着金矿讨饭吃，器材变成氧化铁也不动用。峰峰矿务局的“有备无患”的思想和官僚主义作风把废品都逼得说话了。它们一致的呼声：“我们要在这次运动中得到翻身，审判那些无理囚禁我们的官僚主义者！”
