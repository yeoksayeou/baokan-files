    Taiyuan City Guangda Store Employees
    Warmly Support the Standards and Methods for Categorizing and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households

    Editor: The "Standards and Methods for Categorizing and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households in the 'Five-Anti' Movement" promulgated by the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government has received enthusiastic support from the vast number of workers and shop assistants in Taiyuan City. Cao Chengzhu, a shop assistant at Zhongyuan Photo Studio, said, "Such measures are entirely correct. From this document, we have further recognized the greatness of the Communist Party." Many workers in the fur industry said, "The government's methods are truly in line with our wishes." They are earnestly studying this document in order to master this weapon, continue to deepen the anti-theft movement, and eliminate the criminal acts of illegal capitalists.

    The vast majority of independent laborers and independent operators also warmly welcome this method. Some people said, "The government truly keeps its word; all those who confess frankly will receive lenient treatment." Others said, "The government strives to transform general capitalists as much as possible, and only severely punishes those who are extremely guilty and refuse to confess." Many basically law-abiding capitalists have expressed that they will operate legally and with peace of mind in the future.

    However, there are also a few illegal capitalists—mostly seriously illegal households—who still deliberately take things out of context and distort the spirit of this method in an attempt to resist the movement. We must be vigilant against these people's conspiracies.

### 太原市广大店员工人  热烈拥护关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法

    太原市广大店员工人
    热烈拥护关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法
    编辑同志：中央人民政府政务院公布的“北京市人民政府在‘五反’运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”，得到了太原市广大工人、店员的热烈拥护。中原照相馆店员曹承祖说：“这样的措施是完全正确的，从这个文件中，我们进一步认识了共产党的伟大。”皮毛业许多工人说：“政府的办法真合乎我们的心意。”他们正在认真地学习这个文件，以便掌握这一武器，继续深入反盗窃运动，肃清违法资本家的罪恶行为。
    极大多数独立劳动者、独立经营户对这个办法也是十分欢迎的。有的人说：“政府真是言而有信，凡是坦白的都能得到从宽处理。”有的人说：“政府对一般资本家是尽量争取改造，只有那些罪大恶极、坚不坦白的，才予以严惩。”许多基本守法的资本家，都表示今后安心守法经营。
    但是，也有少数违法资本家——其中多半是严重违法户，仍故意断章取义，曲解这一办法的精神，企图对抗运动。我们必须警惕这些人的阴谋。
