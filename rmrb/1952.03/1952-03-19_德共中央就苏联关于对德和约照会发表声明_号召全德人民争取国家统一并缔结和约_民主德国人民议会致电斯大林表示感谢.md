Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 15th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement regarding the Soviet government's note on the German peace treaty, calling on all German people to unite and, at this decisive moment for Germany, strive for German unification and the conclusion of a peace treaty.

The statement pointed out: Every German patriot sincerely supports the Soviet government's note on the conclusion of a German peace treaty. The Soviet proposal offers the German people the opportunity to regain their sovereignty, build their lives in a peaceful and free environment, in a unified Germany, and coexist peacefully with the people of other countries on an equal footing. This note once again emphasizes that the Soviet Union is peace-loving and hopes to establish peaceful and friendly relations with the German people.

The statement said: The German people demand that the Adenauer government terminate negotiations on the conclusion of a military "General Agreement" and instead begin negotiations with representatives of the German Democratic Republic on holding all-German democratic elections and quickly concluding a peace treaty. Only by establishing mutual understanding between East and West Germany can an all-German government be formed, which can represent the German people in negotiating a peace treaty.

The statement said: The German Communist Party is prepared to reach an agreement with all patriotic and democratic forces, all parties and groups, in order to cooperate jointly in holding all-German elections and quickly concluding a peace treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: TASS, Berlin, March 15th: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic sent a telegram to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Stalin, on the 14th, stating:

The Soviet government's note of March 10 to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, and the draft German peace treaty proposed by the Soviet government, are completely in line with the vital national interests of the German people. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic expresses its warm gratitude to you, and through you to the Soviet government and all the Soviet people.

The Soviet government's proposal is of great historical significance. This proposal paves the way for a peaceful Germany: its state of division will finally be eliminated, and it will develop into a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving country, its trade and peaceful economy will be free from obstacles hindering its development. It is a Germany that hopes to coexist peacefully with all countries in the world.

The Soviet government's proposal has aroused hope in the hearts of millions of German people and opened up prospects for a happy future for all of us in the near future.

The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic recognizes the great responsibility of the German people in the struggle for peace. The People's Chamber has called on the German people to actively support the Soviet government's proposals and exert all their strength to fight for a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: Berlin News: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic discussed the Soviet government's proposal to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of concluding a German peace treaty on the 14th. Speaker of the People's Chamber, Dieckmann, pointed out at the meeting that the Soviet government's proposal conformed to the German people's legitimate demand to conclude a German peace treaty and expressed sincere gratitude to the Soviet government and Marshal Stalin. Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, spoke on behalf of the government, expressing enthusiastic support for the Soviet proposal and suggesting that the People's Chamber urge the West German Bonn Parliament to endorse the Soviet proposal. Finally, the People's Chamber unanimously passed a resolution and decided to send this resolution to the Bonn Parliament immediately. The resolution stated: "The members of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic unanimously approved all the proposals put forward by the Soviet government in its note of March 10 and in the draft German peace treaty at the meeting on March 14. The People's Chamber calls on all the German people to express their wishes and will: the conclusion of a German peace treaty must at least be based on these proposals. We expect the Federal Parliament (i.e., the Bonn Parliament) to express its willingness to conclude a German peace treaty as soon as possible based on the Soviet government's proposals."
