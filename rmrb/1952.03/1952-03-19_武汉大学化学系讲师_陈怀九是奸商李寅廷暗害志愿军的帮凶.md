Chen Huaijiu, a lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at Wuhan University, was an accomplice of the unscrupulous merchant Li Yinting. He was the "technical engineering consultant" for Li Yinting when he contracted to produce "emergency kits" for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He posed as an "expert," acted recklessly, and harmed wounded soldiers of our People's Volunteer Army. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, he not only failed to confess his criminal acts and explain his relationship with the unscrupulous merchant Li Yinting but instead spread reactionary remarks to defend shamelessly Li Yinting and other major corrupt elements, saying they were "sacrifices of political education," attempting to confuse the public and undermine the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. His reactionary words and deeds aroused the boundless indignation of the faculty and students of Wuhan University. After investigation, the Wuhan University Council and the Streamlining and Economy Branch decided to first give Chen Huaijiu a dismissal penalty. As for his legal responsibilities, they will be handled by the People's Government.

In December 1950, Chen Huaijiu privately accepted the position of "technical engineering consultant" for Li Yinting's production of "emergency kits" for the Volunteer Army. Chen Huaijiu designed all the important techniques for disinfecting, drying, and compressing the "emergency kits." He participated in the entire process of making "emergency kits," from disinfecting cotton to packing the kits into boxes. He was personally involved and fully aware of the inside story of the unscrupulous merchant Li Yinting's heinous crime of harming the Volunteer Army with emergency kits containing large amounts of bacteria. However, instead of confessing his criminal behavior and exposing Li Yinting's crimes, Chen Huaijiu shamelessly defended Li Yinting and other major corrupt officials. Chen publicly said that Li Yinting and other major corrupt officials were "sacrifices of political education," and shouted, "The leadership is suppressing democracy," etc., attempting to intimidate leaders and the masses, making everyone afraid to pursue his crimes, and facilitating his unbridled dissemination of various reactionary remarks among the masses. On February 25, at the anti-corruption struggle meeting at Wuhan University, Chen Huaijiu brazenly appeared as an "expert" and "concerned party," pleading for "justice" for the unscrupulous merchant Li Yinting to thousands of teachers and students. Regarding Li Yinting's crime of stealing new cotton allocated to him by the Ministry of Health for making medicinal cotton and using rotten, old cotton as medicinal cotton, he distorted the facts and defended Li Yinting, attempting to prove that Li Yinting's theft of the new cotton allocated by the Ministry of Health was legitimate. He even tried to make everyone believe that Li Yinting's use of old cotton containing large amounts of bacteria, and even cotton taken from corpses and garbage dumps, to make emergency kits was based on "scientific" grounds. He further fabricated rumors, saying, "The method of manufacturing and packing the emergency kits was stipulated in the contract; if there are any problems, the Ministry of Health should be responsible." However, he also said, "I have not seen the contract."

Chen Huaijiu also demonstrated his bad character in his work at the school. He was extremely selfish, self-interested, and only sought profit. He shamelessly said to others, "What is morality or reputation? You can get by if you have money." Therefore, he usually did not teach properly and instead sought various opportunities to make money. Before liberation, he worked as a traveling salesman in Guangzhou. After liberation, he tried every means to contact private merchants in order to make money. He had extensive contacts with private merchants, and the unscrupulous merchant Li Yinting was just one of them.

Starting from his pursuit of profit and self-interest at the expense of others, Chen Huaijiu displayed an extremely selfish "purely technical viewpoint" in his teaching work. He was extremely perfunctory and irresponsible in his teaching work. In the second half of 1951, he only held one exam, and he even made mistakes in the questions. For the chemistry experiments he was responsible for, he only opened the door to the laboratory, and the preparation work for the experiments was all left to the students. He seemed enthusiastic about doing experiments himself, but his purpose was not to teach the chemistry experiment course well, but to use the school's equipment and chemical reagents to conduct experiments that could make money, and then go out and open a factory to obtain patents. Therefore, after researching some "achievements," he kept them secret, calling it "keeping something up his sleeve," and did not tell the students when teaching. He also said to Jiao Gengxin, another teacher in the Department of Chemistry:

"Lao Jiao, don't be silly. If you put all your things out there, you'll never get ahead." In 1951, he published an article in the New Science magazine about his experience in making bakelite from raw lacquer, but he deliberately did not explain the key points clearly, only mentioning the best method in a footnote, which was equivalent to saying nothing. In Chen Huaijiu's view, technology was used to make money. In order to make money, he could help the unscrupulous merchant Li Yinting harm the Volunteer Army. If he couldn't make money, he wouldn't care even about the most urgent military supply tasks on the Korean front.

Chen Huaijiu used "science," "technology," "lecturer," and "expert" as his signboard, saying that he "doesn't ask about politics," "always hates politics," "detests politics," and "never participates in politics"; however, when we compare Chen Huaijiu's history and usual words and deeds, we find that it is the same Chen Huaijiu who, before liberation, when the Kuomintang was running for pseudo-National Assembly representatives, helped his sister's friend pull election votes and find people to stamp their seals; it is the same Chen Huaijiu who, when the U.S. military landed at Incheon in Korea and the Korean People's Army temporarily suffered setbacks, and Xu Maoyong, the secretary-general of Wuhan University, gave a current affairs report on campus, saying that the U.S. military would be defeated, openly said in the Department of Chemistry: "The U.S. military landed in Korea, we were defeated, the matter is clear, what else is there to say?" It is also this Chen Huaijiu who, when Chairman Mao called on us to resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's offensive and the nationwide anti-theft campaign was in full swing, defended Li Yinting, the unscrupulous merchant who harmed the Volunteer Army, and undermined the anti-theft campaign. This shows that Chen Huaijiu is very active in reactionary political activities, and what he hates and detests is only the revolutionary politics led by the Communist Party and the People's Government.

When Chen Huaijiu's reactionary words and deeds were severely criticized, he used "the leadership suppresses democracy" as a shield, clamoring that "Wuhan University has no freedom of speech," pretending to be something that he "suffered a blow," and refusing to submit to the truth. In his view, there is no truth, justice, or morality, only personal relationships based on money. He has repeatedly clamored: "The library should put all the reactionary books in, so that they can be freely compared. How can you know what is good or bad without comparison?"

What kind of freedom of speech does Chen Huaijiu and his ilk demand? That is, they are only allowed to have the freedom to spread reactionary remarks, and others are not allowed to have the freedom to criticize their reactionary words and deeds. As soon as others criticize them, they think they have "suffered a blow" and have "no freedom"; moreover, they do not allow the masses to support revolutionary remarks, only allowing them to support their reactionary and backward remarks. If the masses do not support them, they think they have "suffered a blow" and have "no freedom."

Chen Huaijiu's above-mentioned criminal acts prove that he is a lackey and spokesperson of the bourgeoisie and an accomplice of Li Yinting in harming the Volunteer Army. He has completely lost his qualifications as a people's teacher.

    武汉大学化学系讲师
    陈怀九是奸商李寅廷暗害志愿军的帮凶
    武汉大学化学系讲师陈怀九，是奸商李寅廷的帮凶。他是李寅廷承制人民志愿军“救急包”时的“技术工程顾问”，他冒充“专家”，胡作非为，暗害我人民志愿军的伤员。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，他不但不坦白自己的犯罪行为，交代他和奸商李寅廷的关系，反而散布反动言论，为奸商李寅廷及其他大贪污分子作无耻的辩护，说他们做了“政治教育的牺牲品”，企图混淆群众视听，破坏反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。他这种反动言行，激起了武汉大学全校师生的无比愤慨。武汉大学校务委员会和精简节约分会经过调查，决定先行给予陈怀九以撤职处分，至于他应负的法律责任部分，则待人民政府处理。
    陈怀九于一九五○年十二月私自应聘为李寅廷承制志愿军“救急包”的“技术工程顾问”。“救急包”的消毒、烘干、压缩等重要技术全部为陈怀九所设计。制“救急包”的工作自药棉消毒直到“救急包”装箱打包为止，他是全部参加了的。对奸商李寅廷以含有大量细菌的救急包暗害志愿军的滔天罪行的底细，他是亲临其事、完全了解的。但陈怀九非但不坦白自己的犯罪行为，揭发李寅廷的罪恶，反而为李寅廷及其他大贪污犯作无耻的辩护。陈公然说：李寅廷及其他大贪污犯是“政治教育的牺牲品”，并大叫“领导上压制民主”等等，企图吓唬领导人员和群众，使大家不敢对他的罪行进行追究，并便于他在群众中肆无忌惮地散布各种反动言论。二月二十五日，在武汉大学反贪污斗争大会上，陈怀九竟猖狂地以“专家”和“当事人”的面貌，向全校数千群众为奸商李寅廷“申冤”。他对于李寅廷偷走卫生部发给他做药棉的新棉花，用陈腐的破旧棉花作药棉的罪行，竟歪曲事实地为李寅廷作辩解，企图证明李寅廷偷走卫生部发给的新棉花是正当的，并企图使大家相信李寅廷用含有大量细菌的旧棉甚至用从死人身上和垃圾堆中取出的棉花作救急包是有“科学”根据的。他更进一步造谣说：“救急包制造和装箱的办法，是合同上规定的；如有问题，卫生部应负责任。”但他又说“没有看见合同”。
    陈怀九在学校工作中也表现了他的恶劣品质。他极端自私自利，唯利是图。他曾恬不知耻地对人说：“什么道德名誉，有钱就吃得开。”因此，他平日根本不好好教书，专门寻找各种机会赚钱。解放前，他曾在广州跑过单帮。解放后则想尽各种方法和私商取得联系，以便赚钱。他和私商的联系非常广泛，大奸商李寅廷只不过是其中的一个而已。
    陈怀九从唯利是图、损人利己出发，在教学工作上则表现了极端自私的“单纯技术观点”。他对于教学工作是极端敷衍和不负责的。一九五一年下半年，只举行了一次考试，还把题目出错了。他所负责的化学实验，也只管开一开实验室的门，实验准备工作全都交给同学去作。他自己搞实验看来似还热心，但目的不是把化学实验课程教好，而是想利用学校的仪器设备及化学药品作能赚钱的实验，将来出去开工厂获专利。因此，研究出一些“成绩”之后，则密不告人，谓之“留一手”，教书时不告诉学生。他还向化学系另外一位教员焦庚辛讲：
    “老焦，不要傻，你都把自己的东西摆出来，那永远出不了头。”一九五一年，他在新科学杂志上发表了一篇谈生漆制造胶木的经验的文章，但他故意不把关键的地方交代清楚，把最好的方法只在附注上提了一句，结果等于没有说。在陈怀九看来，技术是用来赚钱的，为了赚钱，他可以帮助奸商李寅廷暗害志愿军。如果赚不到钱，即使是朝鲜前线多么紧急的军需任务他也是不关心的。
    陈怀九以“科学”、“技术”、“讲师”、“专家”作招牌，说什么他“不问政治”、“一向厌恶政治”、“痛恨政治”、“从不参与政治”；但是，我们把陈怀九的历史和平日言行查对一下，发现正是同一个陈怀九在解放前，国民党竞选伪国大代表时，曾替他姐姐的朋友拉选举票，找人盖章；正是这个陈怀九，当美军在朝鲜仁川登陆，朝鲜人民军暂时失利，武汉大学秘书长徐懋庸在校内作时事报告，说美军必败的时候，他在化学系公开讲：“美军在朝鲜登陆，我们败了，事情明摆着，还讲什么？”也正是这个陈怀九，在毛主席号召我们坚决打退资产阶级的进攻，全国进行轰轰烈烈的反盗窃运动的时候，陈怀九却为暗害志愿军的奸商李寅廷狡辩，破坏反盗窃运动。这说明陈怀九对于反动的政治活动是很积极的，他所厌恶和痛恨的只是共产党和人民政府所领导的革命的政治。
    当陈怀九的这些反动言行受到严厉批判的时候，他便以“领导上压制民主”作挡箭牌，叫嚣“武汉大学没有言论自由”，装模作样地说什么自己“遭受了打击”，而不肯服从真理。在他看来，真理、正义、道德是没有的，有的只是以金钱为基础的私人关系。他不止一次地叫嚣：“图书馆应该把所有反动的书摆进去，这样才可以自由比较，不比较怎能知道好坏呢？”
    陈怀九之流所要求的言论自由究竟是什么样的言论自由？那就是只许他们有散布反动言论的自由，不允许别人对他们的反动言行有批评的自由。别人一批评，他们就认为“受了打击”，“没有自由”了；而且他们不允许群众拥护革命的言论，只准拥护他们反动落后的言论。群众不拥护他们，他们就又认为“受了打击”，“没有自由”了。
    陈怀九的上述种种罪恶行为证明了他自己是资产阶级的走狗和代言人，是李寅廷暗害志愿军的帮凶。他已经完全丧失了作为一个人民教师的资格。
