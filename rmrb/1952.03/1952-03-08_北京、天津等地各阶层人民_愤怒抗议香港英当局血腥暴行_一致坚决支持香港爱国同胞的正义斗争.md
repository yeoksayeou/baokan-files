    [Our Newspaper] The serious crime of the British authorities in Hong Kong in bloodily massacring and illegally arresting our patriotic compatriots on the 1st of this month has universally aroused anger and protest among the people of our country. Many readers have written to condemn this act of hostility towards the people of our country by British imperialism. Readers enthusiastically support the solemn statements of various people's organizations in our country protesting against the crimes of the British authorities in Hong Kong. In letters from workers, soldiers, cadres, students, and readers from other walks of life in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Zhengding and other places, some representing groups and units of hundreds or thousands of people, extreme indignation was unanimously expressed at the barbaric behavior of British imperialism in unreasonably arresting and killing our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The letter from all the teachers, students and staff of the Engineering College of Peking University stated: "The series of planned and arranged barbaric acts of British imperialism in Hong Kong are intolerable to every patriotic compatriot." Li Minchun and fifteen other soldiers from a tank regiment of the People's Liberation Army wrote: "British imperialism is the historical enemy of the Chinese nation. More than a hundred years ago, it provoked the Opium War to invade China. ... Its attacks on the people of our country have not diminished to this day." Many readers believe that the recent series of atrocities by British imperialism in Hong Kong are by no means accidental, but a manifestation of its obedience to and implementation of the will of American imperialism to be hostile to the Chinese people.

    Readers unanimously stated in their letters: The Chinese people are fully capable of crushing this provocative behavior of British imperialism towards the Chinese people. The soldiers said, "The Chinese people have stood up heroically and strongly; we will never be lenient towards the enemies who dare to invade the Chinese people." The students' letters said: If British imperialism dares to continue to expand its provocative conspiracy, "then it will inevitably be battered and bloodied before the iron fists of the 475 million Chinese people." Workers and shop assistants said: "The bloody atrocities committed by British imperialism only deepen the unparalleled hatred of the Chinese people," "If it remains unrepentant, persists in its own way, and is determined to be an enemy of the great Chinese people to the end, it will inevitably suffer the consequences of its crimes."

    Many readers expressed their firm support and deep concern for the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the suffering compatriots. Cui Xingmin and twelve other students from Yenching University wrote in their letter: "The compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon have the support of a strong motherland and people, ... their just struggle will surely be victorious!" All the students of Class Four, Group One of the Cadre School of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry attached 48,050 yuan in RMB to their letter as a sum to comfort the suffering compatriots in Hong Kong.

    Many readers further promised to turn their hatred for British imperialism into strength, and use practical actions such as thoroughly completing the tasks of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and studying hard and doing a good job to strengthen the motherland's strength and crack down on the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies.

    北京、天津等地各阶层人民
    愤怒抗议香港英当局血腥暴行
    一致坚决支持香港爱国同胞的正义斗争
    【本报讯】香港英国当局在本月一日血腥屠杀与非法逮捕我爱国同胞的严重罪行，已普遍激起我国人民的愤怒和抗议。许多读者纷纷来信，斥责英国帝国主义这种敌视我国人民的暴行。读者热烈拥护我国各人民团体抗议香港英国当局罪行的严正声明。在北京、天津、唐山、正定等地的工人、战士、干部、学生与其他各阶层的读者来信中，有的代表着几百人或几千人的团体和单位，对于英国帝国主义无理捕杀我香港爱国同胞的野蛮行为一致表示了极度的愤慨。北京大学工学院全体师生员工的来信中说：“英帝国主义在香港这一连串有计划、有布置的野蛮行为，是我们每一个爱国的同胞所不能容忍的。”人民解放军战车某师炮兵团的李民春等十六位战士写道：“英帝国主义是我们中国民族的历史敌人，早在一百多年以前它就挑起了侵略中国的鸦片战争。……它对我国人民的进攻直到今天还是有加无已。”许多读者认为英国帝国主义最近在香港的一系列暴行，决不是偶然的，而是它顺从和执行美国帝国主义敌视中国人民的意志的表现。
    读者在来信中一致表示：英国帝国主义这种对于中国人民的挑衅行为，中国人民是完全有力量能够加以粉碎的。战士们说：“中国人民已经英勇地、坚强地站立起来了；我们对于那胆敢侵犯中国人民的敌人是绝不留情的。”学生的来信中说：如果英国帝国主义敢于继续扩大其挑衅阴谋，“那么，它就必然要在四亿七千五百万中国人民的铁拳面前碰得头破血流。”工人店员说：“英国帝国主义所制造的血腥暴行，只有加深中国人民的无比仇恨”，“如果它仍执迷不悟，一意孤行，与伟大的中国人民为敌到底，它就必将自食其罪行的恶果”。
    许多读者对于香港爱国同胞的正义斗争与受难同胞，表示坚决的支持和深切的关怀。燕京大学崔醒民等十二位同学的来信中说：“港九同胞有着强大的祖国与人民的支持，……他们的正义斗争一定会得到胜利！”中央重工业部干部学校一班四组的全体同学在来信中附了四万八千零五十元的人民币，作为慰问香港受难同胞的款项。
    许多读者还进一步提出保证，要把对于英国帝国主义的仇恨变成力量，用彻底完成反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的任务和努力学习，做好工作等实际行动来加强祖国的力量，打击帝国主义者的侵略阴谋。
