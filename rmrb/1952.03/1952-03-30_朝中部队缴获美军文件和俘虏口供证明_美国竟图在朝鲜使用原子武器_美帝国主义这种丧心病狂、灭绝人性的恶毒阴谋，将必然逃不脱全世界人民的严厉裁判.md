Xinhua News Agency, 29th. According to numerous materials, the American aggressors are plotting to use atomic weapons in Korea after carrying out their vile germ warfare and releasing poison gas. Documents captured from the U.S. military and testimonies from prisoners of war by the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army prove that the U.S.-puppet troops in Korea have universally conducted education on gas, bacteria, and the effects and defensive measures of atomic radiation. On March 13th, the "New York Post" published a dispatch from Washington by reporter Robert Allen saying: "Although still in the 'talking stage,' the Joint Chiefs of Staff are seriously considering the merits of using atomic weapons in Korea. This is the first time the Supreme Command has considered this since the war began." In addition, according to a dispatch from New York on March 4th by United Press reporter Dibble, one of the reasons why the United States is obstructing and delaying the Korean armistice negotiations is because "Korea is a particularly useful place to test weapons." Based on the above materials, the fact that the United States has massively spread bacterial insects in Korea and northeastern China, and the continuous use of poison gas bombs on the Korean battlefield, it seems that after the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff "seriously considered" and education preparations have been carried out among the U.S.-puppet troops, atomic weapons are very likely to be "tested" on the Korean battlefield.

This frantic and inhumane evil conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists cannot but arouse the unparalleled indignation and serious vigilance of all people with a sense of justice in the world. If the U.S. imperialists dare to disregard everything and use atomic weapons in Korea, they will inevitably not escape the severe judgment of the righteous people of the world.

    朝中部队缴获美军文件和俘虏口供证明
    美国竟图在朝鲜使用原子武器
    美帝国主义这种丧心病狂、灭绝人性的恶毒阴谋，将必然逃不脱全世界人民的严厉裁判
    【新华社二十九日讯】根据许多材料证明，美国侵略者正阴谋在进行罪恶的细菌战和施放毒瓦斯之后，还要在朝鲜使用原子武器。据中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军所缴获的美军文件和俘虏的口供都证明在朝鲜的美伪军已普遍地进行了关于瓦斯、细菌及原子放射效力及其防御办法的教育。三月十三日“纽约邮报”载记者罗勃脱·艾伦发自华盛顿的电讯说：“虽然仍在‘谈论阶段’，但联合参谋部正在认真地考虑在朝鲜使用原子武器的可取之处。自从战争开始以来，最高统帅部这样考虑还是第一次。”另据合众社纽约三月四日电讯中记者迪波尔透露，美国之所以阻挠拖延朝鲜停战谈判的原因之一，就是因为“朝鲜是一个用来试验武器的特别有用的地方”。根据以上材料与美国在朝鲜和中国东北境内大量地撒布细菌昆虫和在朝鲜战场上不断使用毒瓦斯弹等事实看来，经过美国联合参谋部“认真地考虑”和在美伪军中已进行了教育准备之后，原子武器很有可能会在朝鲜战场“试验”。
    美帝国主义者这种丧心病狂、绝灭人性的恶毒阴谋不能不引起全世界一切有正义感的人们的无比愤慨与严重警惕。倘美帝国主义者竟敢不顾一切，在朝鲜使用原子武器，则它将必然逃不脱全世界人民正义的严厉裁判。
