    Editor,

    At the very beginning of the Korean War, the American imperialists released many Japanese war criminals who had conducted bacteriological warfare in our country, attempting to drive them to continue killing the Korean and Chinese people and use bacteriological warfare to salvage their disastrous defeat. Recently, disregarding the just warnings from our country and the people of the world, they scattered a large number of insects carrying bacteria in the Northeast region of our country.

    This inhuman and outrageous crime by the American aggressors, which violates international law, sufficiently proves their weakness and incompetence, and their lack of sincerity in the armistice talks. The crime of spreading bacteria by the American aggressors is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese and Korean people. We must hold our weapons tightly, vigilantly watch all the conspiracies and tricks of the American aggressors, and fight to the end to defend the motherland and the happiness and freedom of all mankind!

    Liu Chengzong and 21 other members of an anti-aircraft unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    某防空部队刘成宗等表示握紧武器警惕地保卫祖国
    编辑同志：美帝国主义在朝鲜战争刚刚开始的时候，就先后释放了许多曾在我国进行细菌战争的日本战犯，想驱使他们继续杀害朝中人民，用细菌战争挽救它们的惨败。最近它不顾我国和全世界人民的正义警告，在我国东北地区撒布大量传播细菌的昆虫。
    美国侵略者这种惨无人道的违反国际公法的滔天罪行，足以证明他们软弱无能和对停战谈判毫无诚意。美国侵略者撒布细菌的罪行，是中朝人民所绝对不能容忍的。我们要握紧武器，警惕地注视着美国侵略者的一切阴谋诡计，为保卫祖国、保卫全人类的幸福自由而斗争到底！
    中国人民解放军某防空部队刘成宗等共二十二人
