Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: Japanese democratic trade unions are firmly opposed to the humiliating U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement." According to TASS, Tokyo, March 27th: The trade union newspaper "Printing and Publishing Labor" published a statement from the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions protesting the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement." The statement said: "The purpose of the Administrative Agreement is to make Japan completely dependent on the United States. This agreement was secretly concluded, and the people of the country are unaware of it. This agreement violates both the Japanese Constitution and the rights of the Japanese people. This agreement is completely invalid. We will continue to fight with greater determination to abolish the separate peace treaty, the security treaty, and the shameful Administrative Agreement, and to overthrow the traitorous government and abolish the occupation system."
The newspaper "All Medical News" of the All-Japan Federation of Medical Workers' Unions stated that the union's Central Committee plenary session passed a resolution urging a struggle to abolish the separate "peace treaty," "security treaty," and "Administrative Agreement."

Xinhua News Agency, March 29th: TASS, Tokyo, March 27th: The so-called "Administrative Agreement" imposed on Japan by the United States has already produced results.
On March 24th, the "Mainichi Shimbun" published a preliminary list drafted by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, listing the military bases and locations to be handed over to the U.S. military for use. These include large military factories, air bases, arsenals, and naval bases. The newspaper pointed out that, in addition, the U.S. military will use many reserve airfields, landing strips, radar bases, and other military locations.

    【新华社二十九日讯】日本的民主工会坚决反对屈辱的美日“行政协定”。据塔斯社东京二十七日讯：工会报纸“印刷出版劳动”登载了全日本产业别工会会议的声明，抗议美日“行政协定”。声明说：“行政协定的目的是要使日本完全依赖美国。这个协定是秘密缔结的，全国人民都不知情。这个协定既违反日本宪法又违反日本人民的权利。这个协定是完全无效的。我们将以更大的决心继续为取消单独和约、安全条约和耻辱的行政协定，为打倒卖国政府和废除占领制度进行战斗。”
    全日本医疗从业员工会协议会的报纸“全医疗新闻”说：该工会的中央委员会全体会议通过了一个决议，敦促为取消单独“和约”、“安全条约”和“行政协定”进行斗争。
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社东京二十七日讯：美国强加于日本的所谓“行政协定”，已经产生结果。
    三月二十四日，“每日新闻”发表了日本外务省草拟的一份初步表单，上面列举了将交由美军使用的军事基地和地点。其中包括大军事工厂、飞机基地、军火库和海军基地等。该报指出，此外，美军将使用许多后备飞机场、降落场、雷达基地和其他的军事地点。
