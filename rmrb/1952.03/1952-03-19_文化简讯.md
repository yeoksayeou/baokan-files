Cultural Briefs

    ▲ To cultivate a large number of teachers for workers' and peasants' education and to further develop vocational spare-time education, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Education has decided, based on the "principle of running education with revolutionary methods," to establish twelve workers' and peasants' normal schools in the city's twelve districts (including Tanggu District). Each school is expected to enroll a total of 2,500 students. The target enrollees are mainly literacy class teachers, junior high school graduates, and unemployed or out-of-school youth with senior primary school or junior primary school fourth-grade level education. Each district's worker-peasant normal school will have three classes: elementary, accelerated, and preparatory. The duration of study is projected to be three years for the elementary class, one year for the accelerated class, and one year for the preparatory class before transferring to the elementary class. During their studies, students in the elementary and accelerated classes will practice teaching in their spare time. Upon graduation, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Education will assign the graduates to work in various vocational spare-time schools. The worker-peasant normal schools in the Sixth and Seventh Districts are mostly ready and will officially open classes within days. The remaining schools are actively preparing.
    ▲ The Hunan Provincial Survey and Excavation Team of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently excavated a large number of precious cultural relics in the suburbs of Changsha. The team began work in mid-October last year at four locations: Chenjiadashan and Xujiawan outside Xiaowumen, and nearby Yangjiashan and Wulipai, Shiziling outside Liuyangmen, and Wujialing outside Beimen, excavating a total of 162 ancient tombs (most of which are from the Warring States and Western Han periods). More than 2,000 artifacts were unearthed, including pottery, bronzes, wooden objects, lacquerware, and jade and stone objects. Pottery was the most numerous. The unearthed lacquerware, bronze mirrors, and wooden figurines are extremely exquisite. The most notable finds are a coffin from the Warring States period and stone axes, stone arrowheads, and pottery shards from the Neolithic Age. The coffin was unearthed at Wulipai. The tomb had four layers of outer coffins, and the skeletons inside the coffin were still intact. The tomb also contained valuable funerary objects such as wooden figurines, bamboo slips (with writing on the chest of the wooden figurines and on the bamboo slips), jade disks, bamboo mats, and silk products. No such complete lacquered wooden coffin has ever been excavated from pre-Qin ancient tombs nationwide. The Neolithic stone axes, stone arrowheads, and pottery shards are the second prehistoric artifacts discovered in Hunan. In addition, wooden boat and cart models from the Han Dynasty were also unearthed in a Western Han tomb in Wujialing, which are unprecedented major discoveries.
    ▲ On February 27, the Engineering Team of the Construction Bureau of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government discovered an ancient tomb on Fox Hill in Dunhe Township, Henan, Guangzhou. Based on the inscribed bricks in the tomb, it can be determined that the tomb was built in the sixth or seventh year of Yongjia (Yongjia is the reign title of Emperor Huai of the Western Jin Dynasty, more than 1,600 years ago).
    The ancient tomb is rectangular, with tunnels, ancestral halls, and main halls inside. The tomb surface is round and arched, and the architecture is quite neat. The entire tomb is built of large firebricks, most of which have inscriptions. The preliminary findings in the tomb include five large earthenware jars, four small earthenware jars, and one pottery animal, all glazed.
    After the ancient tomb was discovered, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Culture and Education has requested instructions from the Cultural Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee on how to handle it and has sent people to guard it, temporarily prohibiting visitors from entering in order to conduct further planned excavations.

    ▲中国科学院考古研究所湖南省调查发掘团，最近在长沙市郊区发掘出大批珍贵文物。该团于去年十月中旬开始工作，工作地点为小吴门外陈家大山、徐家湾及附近的杨家山和五里牌、浏阳门外识字岭，北门外伍家岭等四处，共发掘古墓一百六十二处（其中大部分是战国及西汉时期的）。出土古物有陶器、铜器、木器、漆器、玉石器等共二千多件。其中以陶器为最多。出土的漆器、铜镜、木俑等，手工极为精美，其中最引人注意的是战国时代的一副棺木和新石器时代的石斧、石簇和陶片等。这副棺木是五里牌出土的，墓中有椁四层，棺内骷髅都尚完整，墓中并有木俑、竹简（木俑胸前及竹简上均有文字）、玉璧、竹席和绢质制品等珍贵殉葬物。全国范围内曾经发掘的先秦古墓中，还没有像这样完整的漆?木棺。新石器时代的石斧、石簇、陶片等，是湖南第二次发现的史前古物。此外在伍家岭的西汉墓内，还掘出有汉代的木制舟、车模型，这些都是前所未有的重大发现。
    ▲二月二十七日广州市人民政府建设局工程队在广州市河南敦和乡狐狸山发现古墓一座。根据墓中字砖可断定这座古墓是永嘉六、七年所造（永嘉是西晋怀帝年号，距离现在一千六百多年）。
    这座古墓是长形的，内有隧道、道堂、大堂等。墓面是圆拱形的，建筑颇为工整。全墓都用大火砖砌成，多数砖上有文字。现在墓中初步发现的，有大缶五件、小缶四件、陶质兽一件，都有釉。
    古墓被发现后，广州市人民政府文教局已向中南军政委员会文化部请示处理办法，并派人看守，暂时禁止参观者入内，以便进一步作有计划的发掘。
