    Yiyang City Deputy Mayor Jiang Hong is Corrupt and Embezzles
    Relevant Leading Organs Should Quickly Investigate and Handle
    Editor: We are reporting the vile facts of corruption, waste, and bureaucratism of Jiang Hong, Deputy Mayor and concurrently Public Security Bureau Chief of Yiyang City, Hunan Province.

    In 1950, when Jiang Hong was the section chief of the Yiyang City Garrison Command, he privately divided more than one million yuan of surplus public funds with Wang Kun, the director of the Yiyang City Public Security Bureau, Zhao Jude, the suburban director, and four others. In 1951, when land reform was implemented in the suburbs of Yiyang City, Jiang Hong swallowed up the fruits of the farmers' struggle, worth approximately 3.5 million yuan. In addition, Jiang Hong embezzled twenty lengths of khaki cloth and ten bolts of silk material, worth more than 5 million yuan. Jiang Hong also took confiscated pens, watches, and other items from counter-revolutionaries without authorization, either taking them for himself or giving them away. In October 1951, under the pretext of "taking care of old cadres," Jiang Hong misappropriated 12 million yuan of public funds and sent a private merchant, Liu, to Guangzhou to purchase 34 pens, instructing the private merchant to evade taxes. The number of valuable public goods taken away by Jiang Hong from the Finance Section and the Finance Committee warehouse is countless.

    Jiang Hong's wasteful and corrupt behavior is also serious. Whether it's a large or small meeting, Jiang Hong always advocates eating and drinking lavishly. He said, "If we don't eat well at meetings, when will we?" When female guests arrive, Jiang Hong always buys sweets and fruits for lavish "entertainment". Every day, Jiang Hong either runs to the Finance Section and Finance Committee to get things, or stays at home playing the phonograph, looking for people to "talk heart to heart" and joke around. In July 1951, Jiang Hong arbitrarily selected a group of female teachers from the city's primary school teachers who met his so-called "pretty standard" to participate in "work." During his tenure as the Public Security Bureau Chief, he cultivated five "targets" single-handedly. He said, "My ultimate goal in coming south is to find a good lover." However, he treated his original lover in every possible way. Even when the other party was pregnant, he forced her to divorce him.

    Jiang Hong's bureaucratic style is also extremely serious. Since he served as the section chief of the Yiyang Garrison Command, the Deputy Mayor of Yiyang City, and the Director of the Public Security Bureau, he has consistently been arrogant, not implementing the Party's policies and resolutions, and issuing orders without authorization. He only uses cadres without educating them, and once a cadre makes a mistake, he adopts the so-called "Jiang Hong policy" - beating, scolding, expulsion, and imprisonment. For his own personal desires, he promotes cadres who flatter him, while attacking, squeezing out, and suppressing cadres who are loyal to the Party's cause and adhere to the Party's principles.

    We believe that Jiang Hong has been corrupted by bourgeois ideology and has degenerated. Relevant leading departments should quickly investigate and handle this matter.

### 益阳市副市长江洪贪污腐化  有关领导机关应速检查处理

    益阳市副市长江洪贪污腐化
    有关领导机关应速检查处理
    编辑同志：我们检举湖南省益阳市人民政府副市长兼公安局局长江洪的贪污、浪费、官僚主义等恶劣事实。
    一九五零年，江洪任益阳市警备司令部科长时，私自和益阳市公安局局长王崑、郊区所长赵钜德等六人，瓜分了节余的公款一百多万元。一九五一年益阳市郊实行土地改革时，江洪吞没农民斗争果实，约值三百五十万元。另外，江洪又贪污了二十丈卡叽布、十匹线春丝料，约值五百多万元。江洪还把没收反革命分子的钢笔、手表等物，擅自拿去或转送别人。一九五一年十月间，江洪在“照顾老干部”的藉口下，挪用公款一千二百万元，派私商刘某往广州购买钢笔三十四支，并指示该私商逃避税款。财政科、财委会仓库中的贵重公物，被江洪拿走的不知其数。
    江洪的浪费、腐化行为也是严重的。不论开大会、小会，江洪总是主张大吃大喝。他说：“开会不吃点好的，等什么时候？”女客来时，江洪总要买糖、买水果，大肆“招待”。江洪每天不是跑财政科、财委会搞东西，就是在家开留声机，找人“谈心”、开玩笑。一九五一年七月间，江洪擅自从市属各小学教员中挑选一批所谓“够漂亮标准”的女教员，来参加“工作”。他在公安局长任内，一手培养了五个“对象”。他说：“我的南下最终目的，就是找个好爱人。”他对原来的爱人，却百般虐待。正当对方怀孕时，他威逼着要离婚。
    江洪的官僚主义作风也异常严重。他自任益阳警备司令部科长、益阳市副市长、公安局局长以来，一贯居功自傲，不执行党的政策和决议，擅自发号施令。他对干部只使用不教育，一旦干部犯了错误，即采取所谓“江洪政策”——打骂、开除、坐牢。他为了个人的私欲，对逢迎他的干部则提拔，对忠于党的事业、坚持党的原则的干部，则打击、排挤、压制。
    我们认为江洪已经被资产阶级思想腐蚀了，已经蜕化了，有关领导方面应当迅速检查处理。
