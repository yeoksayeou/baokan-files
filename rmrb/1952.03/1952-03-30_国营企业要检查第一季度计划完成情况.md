Brief Economic Commentary

    After Party organizations and enterprise leadership organs in various regions issued instructions on strengthening business operations during the "Three-Anti" campaign, the production situation in most state-owned enterprises has gradually improved. Many factories and mines have successfully completed their March production plans. However, there are still many factories and mines that continue to neglect leadership in production, so that they still failed to complete their production tasks according to plan in March, let alone make up for the shortfall in January and February. The State-Owned Shandong Mining Bureau is one such example. Although the bureau also established production offices at all levels, these production offices were merely a formality. They had few cadres, and they did not truly take responsibility for solving problems in production in a timely manner. The responsible cadres in these units did not adopt a fighting spirit, devising various methods to overcome difficulties and rapidly improve production; instead, they mistakenly continued to abandon leadership in production. This situation should attract the attention of leading cadres in various factories and mining enterprises. With March coming to an end, leading cadres of state-owned enterprises should seize the time to inspect the completion of the first quarter's production plan and take effective measures to strive to make up for the production shortfall in the first quarter during the second quarter.

    国营企业要检查第一季度计划完成情况
    各地党的组织和企业领导机关分别发出在“三反”运动中加强业务工作的指示后，大多数国营企业的生产情况已经逐步好转。许多厂矿已经很好地完成了三月份的生产计划。但是，也还有不少厂矿依然放松对生产的领导，以致三月份仍然不能按计划完成生产任务，更无法补足一、二月份的差额。国营山东矿务局就是如此。该局虽然也成立了各级的生产办公室，但是这些生产办公室只是一个形式，其中干部很少，并且没有真正负起责任及时解决生产中的问题。这些单位的负责干部，不是以战斗的精神，想出各种办法，克服困难，使生产迅速提高；他们却错误地继续放弃对于生产的领导。这个情况应引起各个厂矿企业领导干部的注意。三月就要完了，国营各企业的领导干部应该抓紧时间，检查第一季度生产计划完成的情况，并采取有效的措施，争取在第二季度补足第一季度生产的差额。
