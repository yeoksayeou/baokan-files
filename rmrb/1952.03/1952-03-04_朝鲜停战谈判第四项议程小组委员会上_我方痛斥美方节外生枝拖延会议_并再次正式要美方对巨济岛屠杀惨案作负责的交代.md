    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 3rd: On the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on March 3rd, our side's representative sternly condemned the other side's attitude and actions of creating extraneous issues, refusing to discuss problems, and deliberately delaying the meeting; and pointed out that the issues of priority repatriation of seriously ill and wounded prisoners of war, exchange of prisoner of war parcels, and joint Red Cross teams visiting both sides' prisoner of war camps were all issues that had already been resolved. In order to delay the meeting, the other side actually proposed to re-discuss the issue of prisoner of war materials on the second day after the two sides had passed an agreement on these issues. Our representative pointed out that the other side's representative had mentioned the "agreements" of December 29th and January 1st, but the records of the subcommittee meetings on those two days clearly recorded that the agreement between the two sides at that time was that the other side should first hand over the basic materials that should have been handed over to our side on December 18th, including materials on more than 44,000 of our captured personnel, as soon as possible, and then the two sides would exchange supplementary materials within a possible scope. Our representative also cited the subcommittee meeting records to prove that it was the other side that violated the agreement between the two sides and their own promises; on December 31st, they said that this basic material could be submitted to our side on January 2nd, and on January 3rd, they said that it would be handed over to our side as soon as it was prepared. However, on January 12th, the other side suddenly changed its tune and said that our side did not need this material, and on the 15th, it changed its tune again and said that this basic material had to be exchanged for our side's supplementary material, and on the 18th, it publicly declared that this basic material was not basic material. To this day, more than seventy days have passed since the handover of the basic materials, and the other side has still not handed over this material. Our representative sternly questioned the other side, "Who is violating the agreement? Who is violating their own promises?"
    Regarding the incident on February 18th in which the other side massacred our captured personnel in the Geoge Island prisoner of war camp, our representative solemnly declared that after our staff were ordered to lodge a protest on February 23rd, the other side gave an absurd response that could not be imagined on February 27th. Our staff were again ordered to issue a statement on February 28th, but the other side has not given a responsible response to this. Our side now formally demands that the other side provide a responsible explanation for this massacre and for each of our captured personnel who were brutally murdered.
    At the Third Agenda staff meeting, the other side still unreasonably opposed our side's neutral country nominations and insisted on its unreasonable plan on the issues of rotation and port, so the meeting made no progress.

    朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上
    我方痛斥美方节外生枝拖延会议
    并再次正式要美方对巨济岛屠杀惨案作负责的交代
    【新华社开城三日电】三月三日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上，我方代表痛斥对方节外生枝拒绝讨论问题，有计划拖延会议的态度和行动；并指出重病重伤战俘优先遣返问题、交换战俘包裹问题和联合红十字会小组访问双方战俘营问题都是早已解决的问题。对方为了拖延会议竟在双方通过有关这些问题的协议的第二天，又提出要重行讨论关于战俘的材料问题。我方代表指出对方代表曾提到十二月二十九日和一月一日的“协议”，但那两天的小组会记录却清清楚楚地记载着当时双方的协议是，首先对方应将十二月十八日即应交与我方的基本材料，其中包括四万四千余我方被俘人员的材料，早日交出，然后双方在可能范围内交换补充材料。我方代表并引用小组会记录证明正是对方违反双方协议和自己的诺言；在十二月三十一日说这项基本材料在一月二日可以提交我方，一月三日又说一准备好就交给我方。但至一月十二日对方突然改口竟说这项材料我方不必需要，十五日又改口说这项基本材料须与我方的补充材料交换，十八日更公然宣称这项基本材料不是基本材料。至今距交出基本材料已七十余日，对方仍未交出此项材料。我方代表严词质问对方“是谁在违反协议？是谁在违反自己的诺言？”
    关于二月十八日对方在巨济岛战俘营屠杀我方被俘人员的事件，我方代表郑重声明我方参谋人员在二月二十三日奉命提出抗议后，对方在二月二十七日作了一个令人不能设想的荒谬的回答。我方参谋人员于二月二十八日又奉命发表声明，迄今对方对此并未有负责的回答。我方现在正式要求对方对于此项屠杀惨案及每个惨遭杀害的我方被俘人员必须作负责的交代。
    第三项议程参谋会议上对方仍然毫无理由地反对我方中立国提名，并在轮换与口岸问题上坚持其无理方案，会议因而毫无进展。
