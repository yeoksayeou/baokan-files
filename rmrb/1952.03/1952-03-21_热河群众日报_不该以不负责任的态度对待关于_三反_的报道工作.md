Rehe Masses Daily
Should Not Treat the Reporting Work on the "Three Antis" with an Irresponsible Attitude
To the Editor: The Rehe Masses Daily has done a lot of publicity work in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, which has played a certain role in promoting the movement. However, the Rehe Masses Daily has shown objectivism in some of its reports; in mass work, there is also a rather serious bureaucratic style.

The Rehe Masses Daily has not expressed its attitude in some reports of major corruption and theft cases. For example, on February 7, the newspaper published a news item entitled "Leading Cadres Fight Alone, Shop Employees and Workers Don't Move, the Anti-Movement in Chengde's Civil Engineering and Construction Industry is Poor." This title itself has the problem of objectivism. The news said that the Chengde Municipal People's Government only sent one cadre to lead the movement in the civil engineering and construction industry, and as a result, the profiteer Li Yongzhen took advantage of the loophole, causing the "movement to be poor." This is a very important issue, but the newspaper did not express its own attitude.

In handling readers' letters, the Rehe Masses Daily showed confusion and irresponsibility. For example, on January 25, the newspaper criticized our department's anti-corruption movement. On February 9, we sent our reply letter on this issue to the newspaper for processing through the Office of the Rehe Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. This letter had not been published by February 13. From the 13th to the 15th, we inquired with the newspaper by telephone four times. Some comrades who answered the phone said that they had not seen the manuscript, and some said that the manuscript could not be found. Finally, Comrade Tian Guoru from the newspaper called and said, "Please write another copy, the original manuscript has been lost." This phenomenon is really intolerable. I hope the Rehe Masses Daily will correct this bureaucratic style.

### 热河群众日报  不该以不负责任的态度对待关于“三反”的报道工作

    热河群众日报
    不该以不负责任的态度对待关于“三反”的报道工作
    编辑同志：热河群众日报在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，作了许多宣传工作，对运动是起了一定的推动作用的。但是，热河群众日报在某些报道中，有客观主义的表现；在群众工作上，还有相当严重的官僚主义作风。
    热河群众日报在一些大贪污、大盗窃案件的报道中，没有表示自己的态度。如二月七日该报刊登了题为“领导干部孤军作战，店员工人没动起来，承市土木建筑业运动差劲”的消息，这个标题本身，就有客观主义的毛病。这个消息说承德市人民政府只派了一个干部去领导土木建筑业的运动，结果被奸商李永珍钻了空子，使“运动差劲”了。这是一个十分重大的问题，但该报并没表示自己的态度。
    在处理读者来信方面，热河群众日报表现了混乱和不负责任。例如，一月二十五日，该报对我部的反贪污运动提出了批评。二月九日，我们就把关于这个问题的答复信，经由中共热河省委办公室转给该报处理。这封信直到二月十三日还没有登载。从十三日到十五日，我们以电话向报社询问四次。接电话的同志，有的说没见到稿子，有的说稿子找不到了。最后，报社田果如同志来电话说：“请你们再写一份吧，那份稿子已找不到了。”这种现象实在是不能容忍的。希望热河群众日报纠正这种官僚主义作风。
