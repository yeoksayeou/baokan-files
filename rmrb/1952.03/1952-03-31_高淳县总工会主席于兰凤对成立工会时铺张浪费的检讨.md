Column: Reaction to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editors: The reader's criticism published in the People's Daily on January 21st regarding the extravagance and waste that occurred during the establishment of the Gaochun County Federation of Trade Unions is correct. After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched in various places, I mistakenly believed that this was a matter for the financial departments. When Gaochun County held its first Workers' Representative Congress, it cost a lot of money, and I actually thought it "didn't matter." My bureaucratic work style is very serious. I didn't know beforehand that we were going to erect colored archways and pine gates, and I didn't stop it when I found out. I even refused to consider adopting suggestions when someone raised them with me. After the newspaper published the letter of criticism, not only did I not humbly accept it, but I mistakenly thought that people were taking advantage of the situation and "following the trend." What a serious mistake this is!
    After this democratic review and the criticism from the Party newspaper, I realized the harm of my non-proletarian thoughts. In the future, I will thoroughly correct my mistakes, accept the opinions of the masses at all times and in all places, improve my work, and atone for my sins to the people. I request the higher authorities to give me disciplinary action.

    Chairman of the Gaochun County Federation of Trade Unions

    高淳县总工会主席于兰凤对成立工会时铺张浪费的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报一月二十一日刊载的读者对高淳县总工会成立时发生铺张浪费的批评是正确的。各地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后，我还错误地认为这是财经部门的事。高淳县第一次开工人代表大会，花了不少钱，我竟以为“无所谓”。我的官僚主义作风是很严重的，我事前不知道要扎彩门和松门，发觉后也未加阻止，甚至在有人向我提出意见时，我也不考虑采纳。报纸发表了批评信后，我不但不虚心接受，反而错误地认为这是人家钻空子，“赶浪潮”。这是多么严重的错误！
    经过这次民主检查和党报的批评，我认识到自己这种非无产阶级思想的危害性。今后我要彻底改正错误，随时随地接受群众的意见，改进工作，向人民赎罪。我请求上级给予我处分。
    高淳县总工会主席  于兰凤
