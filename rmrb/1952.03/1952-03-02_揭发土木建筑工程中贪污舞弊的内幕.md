Editor's Note: For the past two or three years, the People's Government has made huge investments in national infrastructure construction. Now, the facts have proven that due to the serious bureaucracy of responsible cadres in many leading organs, as well as the collusion between construction companies and corrupt elements, almost every construction project has experienced corruption and malpractice, causing very significant losses to the state. This is an extremely painful lesson. After confessing their crimes, some engineering personnel from the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, in order to reform and start anew, have exposed the inside story of corruption and malpractice in civil engineering and construction. This article is compiled based on the materials they revealed. Although the inside story revealed in this article is not yet complete, it can help various regions find some tricks for inspecting corruption and waste in construction projects during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

In civil engineering and construction projects, contractors and engineering personnel collude, from the initial design to the completion of the project, and can engage in corruption in many ways. The main methods of corruption are underreporting and shoddy workmanship. The following are the main loopholes in each process. It is hoped that cadres responsible for leading engineering work will pay more attention and be highly vigilant.

**Fabricating Drawings and Budgets**

Design and estimation are the first important steps in infrastructure construction. In this step, drawings and budgets are most prone to problems. If attention is not paid at this time, after construction begins, time will pass, and the problems will not be easily discovered. Illegal contractors collude with engineering personnel, first looking for ways to cheat in these two areas.

The cheating in design is mainly manifested in the untruthfulness of drawings and specifications. Some exaggerate a certain part of the project, making it different from the actual situation, in order to achieve the purpose of falsely reporting quantities, from which contractors can profit. For example, in earthwork excavation and filling, cross-sectional drawings can be falsified, making the original ground surface of the part to be filled look lower than it actually is; and making the original topography of the part to be excavated look larger than it actually is. In this way, from the drawings, the amount of work to be done seems very large, but in reality, it is not. After construction begins, it is impossible to check. This kind of cheating occurs most often in highway, railway, and water conservancy projects. In general reinforced concrete projects, the amount of steel bars required per unit volume of concrete varies greatly depending on the structural method. The minimum is 460 pounds per hundred cubic feet; the maximum can be more than 2,900 pounds. Steel bars are very expensive and are buried in the concrete, making it impossible to check. Therefore, the thickness, number, length, dimensions, and quality grade of steel bars become the main objects of falsification in the drawing specifications. Other materials used in hidden or difficult-to-distinguish parts are also often deliberately exaggerated in dimensions and specifications in the drawings. Such as: the thickness of grilles and their arrangement spacing, the construction of roof trusses and the quality and types of ironware and wood materials required, the mixing ratio of cement, yellow sand, and gravel, etc., can all be planned in advance from the perspective of needing a lot of money, and then reduced in workmanship and materials later. In terms of foundation engineering, it is also easiest to cheat. It is common to deliberately increase the area and thickness of the footing in the design; or to increase the depth built underground. This not only allows for the false reporting of the quantity of the footing itself but also increases the false reporting of the structures above it, such as piers and toe walls. The above are the first methods used by these engineering personnel to cheat in drawings. The second method is to deliberately use ambiguous language, leaving room for flexible changes. For example, several kinds of engineering practices and dimensions are not noted in the drawings, but only stated in the specifications that "for any kind of project, unless otherwise specified in the drawings, the rest shall be handled according to a certain method." The so-called "certain method" must be more labor-intensive and material-intensive, which will facilitate cheating in the future. There are also cases where the total dimensions and sub-dimensions in the drawings are deliberately made inconsistent, looking ambiguous, which will facilitate collusion with contractors during construction. The third method of cheating is to lay an ambush in advance. Some engineering personnel know in advance that there may be large additional costs, such as strengthening the footing, adding piling, and other necessary equipment; but they deliberately hide it in the design, allowing contractors who collude with them to estimate a low price and win the bid, and then seek huge profits from the additional costs. The fourth method is to deliberately create mystery in the designed drawings, used to scare others, making it impossible for people to understand, except for contractors who have a relationship with the engineering personnel and know the secrets in advance. For example, small sample drawings such as decoration and other detailed drawings are drawn in a particularly complex and difficult way, but in fact, they will not be like this in the future; some deliberately write foreign languages, making them unfathomable. The fifth method is to use two sets of drawings, one real and one fake. The fake drawings are used during bidding, and another set is replaced during construction. A relatively concealed method of falsifying drawings is to deliberately show very little of the parts that are planned to be increased a lot in the bidding drawings, allowing the other party to set a large unit price; conversely, the parts that can be reduced a lot in the future are deliberately increased, allowing the other party to set a very small unit price; this kind of drawing is actually equivalent to a fake. For example, if the floor slab is originally planned to be mainly made of wood structure, and only a small room is specified to be made of reinforced concrete. If the wood floor slab is estimated to be very cheap and the cement floor slab is estimated to be very expensive, the total bid price will still be very low. When all or most of the cement floor slab is completely changed and the wood floor is canceled or reduced, the contractors who collude with themselves can greatly increase the bill and obtain illegal profits in the future because they have the original unit price as a basis. The sixth method is to exchange information in the design and focus on materials. For example, deliberately using materials that are out of stock in the design, but using other materials instead during construction. Sometimes, these engineering personnel can also design according to the favorable conditions of the contractors who collude with them, according to a certain specification of materials they currently have, so that the other party can benefit and facilitate profiteering. There are also those who secretly inform the other party of the large quantities of materials that will be needed in the future, so that the other party can manipulate them. The above six methods of cheating are not easy for outsiders to detect. The most important way to prevent this is to carefully review the drawings and calculation books in advance; and the subsequent construction inspection is also very important. In addition, the procedures for adding accounts should be very strict; attention should also be paid to keeping relevant information confidential.

The fraud in the budget is nothing more than deliberately inflating the amount of work and the unit price, reserving room for cheating. Especially in the more elusive parts. For example: waterproofing fees for bridges and water conservancy projects and general project equipment management fees have a lot of flexibility and are very easy to over-estimate to deceive others. Material losses can be over-estimated; labor has no fixed standard and can also be particularly generous. Water and electricity and heating projects in building construction are specialized technologies and are very easy to cheat. The transportation distance in earthwork projects can also be calculated randomly, thus increasing transportation costs. The estimation of repair projects is difficult to do correctly, and therefore, it is also easy to cheat. In addition to paying attention to verification and inspection, the methods to prevent false budgets must also be compared in many ways and master the rules.

**Traps in Tendering**

After the design is completed, the next step is bidding. Engineering personnel who have been bought off use all means to create opportunities for contractors who collude with them to win the bid, so that they can cut corners and make huge profits. First, these engineering personnel use various restrictive measures to prevent other contractors from participating in the bidding. For example, postponing or shortening the announcement date of the bidding, catching others off guard. When other contractors come to collect the bids, these engineering personnel claim that they have been collected or have expired, and do not give drawings and specifications. Sometimes, they also stipulate the special experience and qualifications of the bidders, so that they exactly match the conditions of the contractors who collude with them, while others cannot be considered qualified. Secondly, when these engineering personnel have relationships with all the bidders, they adopt the "lift the sedan chair" method. They have long been in contact with each other and take turns to win the bid; but on the surface, they have to make a formality and organize several construction companies to bid. In this case, these engineering personnel have also increased the budget early, so that even if the contract price is not too high, they can still find huge profits in cutting corners. If a contractor who has no relationship with the engineering personnel participates and wins the bid with the lowest estimate, these engineering personnel will collude with the related contractors to make this contractor lose a lot of money, so that he will never dare to try again in the future. Thirdly, it is still possible to open "soft bids" during bidding. The method is often to retain the lower bids after opening the bids. At this time, these engineering personnel see that although the bid submitted by a family that colludes with them is not the lowest bid, but the estimate is still low, they can invite other retained contractors to talk and force other contractors to automatically give in again; or propose other conditions to make others dare not agree; or temporarily set various restrictive measures, such as comparing experience, capital, guarantor, working ability, and completion deadline, in order to make a family that colludes with them selected. Fourthly, selling the bottom price. This method is often used when adopting reasonable bids. The so-called reasonable bid does not take the lowest estimate as the standard, but aims to prevent contractors from opening bad accounts and estimating the bid price too high or too low, which is detrimental to the project; but because the contractor who colludes with the engineering personnel already knows the bottom price, only this contractor can be closest to their budget, so they can steadily win the bid. This method of selling the bottom price makes it easy for contractors to win the bid even in cases where reasonable bids are not adopted and the lowest bid is still adopted. Sometimes, these engineering personnel deliberately do not list the quantity of various materials in the bid, allowing other bidders to calculate it themselves; but the contractors who collude with themselves have the original budget to copy. In this way, this contractor is easy to obtain the contracting right. Or deliberately let the other party omit the bill and estimate a low bid price, so they can win the bid first, and then find a way to add to the contractor's bill, so as to steal state property. In addition, supervisors and engineering personnel collude to cheat, and they can also publish a number of contractors who collude with them at the end with a figure that is less than the lowest price of other companies. In this way, this contractor will definitely win the bid. If the project is entrusted to an agent, the engineering personnel who collude with the contractor can directly designate the contractor, who can not only cut corners but also get a high agency fee. In the bidding process, strictly controlling and giving play to the role of the supervisor can preemptively detect these tricks.

**Three-in-One Cutting Corners**

Construction is the main step of a project. Poor construction directly affects the quality of the building. However, contractors regard construction as the main link in their theft of state assets and destruction of national infrastructure construction. Contractors collude with supervisors and foremen, three in one, and use the means of cutting corners to achieve their purpose of stealing state property. There are many ways for them to cut corners, some focusing on a few large ones; others are accumulating small amounts to make a large one. Generally, those with large packages (material and labor) mainly steal materials, while those with small packages (only labor) mainly steal labor. However, whether it is stealing labor or cutting materials, it is often done in the most critical parts of the project.

There are two ways to steal labor, one is to over-report the number of workers and wages; the other is to produce rough and shoddy products. The former is open theft; the latter is insidious destruction, and its danger is even greater. In carpentry, the rough and shoddy workmanship is mostly done in a perfunctory manner in inlaying, joining, splicing, and mortising; for example, the parts that should be joined by mortise and tenon are fixed with wire nails, which affects the appearance is a small matter, and endangering safety is more serious. There are more tricks in the rough and shoddy workmanship in masonry. Three-seven rammed earth or mortar and three-in-one soil is the foundation of the building, but they are unwilling to mix it evenly; they should be poured into the trenches several times, but they reduce the number of times; the ramming is not firm; the broken bricks are not crushed; the slurry is not poured enough. When building brick walls, they do not ask the workers to pay attention to watering the bricks; they do not ask the workers to use full knives of mortar; they do not ask the workers to pull the line to correct the vertical and horizontal directions; they do not ask the workers to avoid overlapping joints. The reason why reinforced concrete is used in construction projects is for firmness and durability. However, when mixing cement, they do not ask the workers to wash the yellow sand and gravel; they do not remove grass roots and debris, and they are unwilling to add water appropriately and mix it thoroughly. When tying steel bars, they do not ask the workers to tie them firmly. As a result, the position is inaccurate, easy to loosen, and weakens the due strength. After the reinforced concrete is tamped, they are unwilling to wait a few more days, and then do other projects on it, and remove the shells or supporting wood too early, reducing the strength of the project. When doing plastering work, they do not wait for the first coat of plaster to dry slightly, and then do the second coat; the plastering is not straight, which is easy to cause cracks and peeling. They even secretly saw off the parts that are difficult to drive in, just to save labor, regardless of the stability of the building.

Reducing materials is often combined with stealing labor; it is the most serious damage to the durability and consolidation of buildings. The main aspects of their material reduction are: one is expensive materials, and the other is materials that are not easily detected. Such as stealing steel bars, deliberately tying the steel bars into a flexible joint inside the shell, so that they can be removed at any time after inspection, but it is not easy to detect their intention at that time. The method of stealing cement is to change the composition of the three-in-one soil and reduce the amount of cement used. The original ratio was one (cement), two (yellow sand), and four (gravel), but they made one, three, six; the regulation was one, three, six, but they made one, four, eight. Measuring yellow sand and gravel with baskets, measuring cement with wooden buckets, the baskets and buckets can no longer be an accurate ratio, and when measuring with baskets, they are filled to the brim, and when measuring with buckets, they are loaded loosely and shallowly, and then some water is poured into the bucket, which looks like the cement is loaded enough, but in fact, a part at the bottom of the bucket is always sticking and cannot be poured out, reducing the bucket's proper volume. The foundation material is even easier to steal, mainly by reducing the depth and width of the trench, so that less three-in-one soil can be made, which saves both materials and labor. There are also many ways to steal wood. Or increase the spacing between rows, such as piling, flat top bars, board wall bars, and grilles, can all reduce the number of practical roots according to this method; or in the difficult to check parts, simply change the dimensions and specifications of the materials used, replacing the coarse ones with thin ones, replacing the square ones with round ones, and reducing the quality of the materials, using rotten wood with holes as good materials; for painting work, the methods of cutting corners are especially varied, commonly known as "paint confusion," which makes it even more difficult to check for problems. In addition, the parts where wood and wood are in contact are not fully coated with water tar; it is even common for the joints of moisture-proof felt to not be glued with rosin tar. Steel bars, cement, wood, and felt are all relatively expensive materials; if the contractor bears the cost, of course he will steal and reduce the use, if he supplies them himself, he is also easy to overestimate and fraudulently claim them, steal them and sell them, any material can be used as good goods with inferior goods, and a little red dan paint can steal the day and change the day to deceive outsiders.

Supervisors are mostly engineering personnel, directly responsible to the design engineer; if the design engineer and the contractor have no collusion, the contractor's cutting corners will not dare to be too rampant. But in most cases, they are colluding with each other. Therefore, to prevent contractors from cutting corners, we can only improve the political awareness of supervisors and strengthen their sense of responsibility for protecting state property.

**Covering Up Inferior Traces, Passing the Last Hurdle**

The project is completed, and contractors collude with engineering personnel, as usual, to make a big fortune. At this time, the main thing is to cheat in the additional accounts. What should be added is of course added, and what should not be added is also added; not only will the accounts that should be reduced not be reduced, but in order to create something out of nothing, they will fabricate facts and falsely report out of thin air. On materials, temporary workers, and daily expenses, they mostly make fake receipts for reimbursement. As for the acceptance work of the project, it is easier for contractors to pass the hurdle; as long as the engineering personnel nod, others will not easily see the problems. Moreover, the appearance of the building has been added a layer of decoration, and the damaged and inferior parts have been covered up, making it even more difficult for the acceptance personnel to detect. After a rainy season, all the holes and sores of the project came out. At this time, although the original contractor was found, the loss to the country has already been caused.

    揭发土木建筑工程中贪污舞弊的内幕
    编者按：两三年以来，人民政府在国家基本建设上进行了巨大的投资。现在事实已经证明，由于许多领导机关的负责干部存在着严重的官僚主义以及营造厂商和贪污分子内外勾结，几乎没有一件建筑工程中没有贪污舞弊现象，使国家遭受了十分重大的损失。这是一个极惨痛的教训。中央人民政府财政部一部分工程人员在坦白了自己的罪行之后，为了改过自新，又把土木建筑工程中贪污舞弊的内幕揭发出来。这篇文章就是根据他们揭发的材料整理出来的。这篇文章所揭发的内幕虽然还不完备，但可帮助各地在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中找到检查建筑工程贪污浪费的一些窍门。
    在土木建筑工程中，营造商和工程人员内外勾结，从开始设计到工程完工，在很多地方都能贪污。贪污的办法主要是以少报多和偷工减料。下面是各个过程中的主要漏洞，希望负责领导工程工作的干部多予注意，严加警惕。
    假造图样和预算
    设计和估价是基本建设工作的第一个重要步骤。在这一个步骤里，图样和预算最容易出毛病；这时如不注意，开工之后，时过境迁，弊病不容易再被发觉。违法的营造商勾结工程人员，首先就在这两方面找舞弊的门道。
    设计中的作弊，主要表现在图样和说明书的不真实。有的把工程中某一部分夸大，使它和实际情况不一样，达到虚报数量的目的，营造商便可从中得利。如土石方的填挖工作，可伪造横断面图，把应填部分的原地面，画得比实际低；又把应挖部分的原形势，画得比实际大。这样从图样中看起来，应做的工程数量确似很多，其实并不如此；开工之后，就无法查对了。这种舞弊，发生在公路、铁路及水利等工程中最多。在一般钢筋水泥工程中，每单位体积混凝土需用的钢条数量，随着结构方法的不同，出入很大。每一百立方英尺最少者需用四百六十磅；多者可用到二千九百多磅。钢条的价格很贵，而且都埋在混凝土内，无从检查出来。因此，钢筋的粗细、根数、长短尺寸及出品等级，便是在图样说明书内尽可伪造的主要对象。其他凡是用在隐藏或不易辨别部分的材料，也往往在图样中把尺寸和规格成份故意加重。如：櫊栅的粗细及其排列中距，屋架的做法及其需用铁器、木料的品质种类，水泥与黄沙石子的配合比例等，都可先从需要化钱很多的方面作计划，以后再偷工减料。在基础工程方面，也最容易作弊。常在设计时特别加大底脚的面积与厚度；或者再把筑在地面以下的深度加大。这样不但可以虚报底脚本身的应做数量，而且可以增多虚报在它上部的结构物，如墩子及勤脚墙等。以上都是这些工程人员在图样中作假的第一个办法。第二个办法是故意含糊其词，留出可以灵活变化的余地。如把若干种工程做法及尺寸，不在图内注明，仅在说明书内说明“凡某种工程，除于图内另有规定外，其余均照某种办法办理”，所谓某种办法，必是比较费工费料的，这样，将来就便于作弊；也有把图样内的总尺寸和分尺寸故意搞成不符，看起来模棱两可，将来施工时就便于向营造商勾结。第三个作弊办法，是预先打埋伏。有些工程人员事前明知可能有很大的加账，如加强底脚，增做打桩，以及其他必要的设备；但却在设计时隐去不谈，让和自己有勾结的营造商先估低价，争取得标，以后再从加账中找取暴利。第四个办法是在设计的图样内故弄玄虚，用来骇唬别人，使人无法看懂，只有与工程人员有关系的营造商，事先得知其中的秘密。如把装修等小样图和其他大样详图画得特别复杂难做，事实上将来并非这样；有的故意注上外国文字，叫人莫测高深。第五个办法是根本用两套图样，一个是真的，一个是假的。在招标时用的是假图样，施工时另换一套。一种比较隐蔽的造假图的方法，是在招标图样内，把将来计划增加很多的部分，故意显示得很少，让对方定出很大的单价；相反的把将来可以减去很多的部分，故意增大，让对方定出很小的单价；这种图样实际上等于假的。如原定楼板主要均做木结构，仅一小间规定做钢筋水泥。如果把木楼板估得很贱，水泥楼板估得很贵，对投标总价来说仍是很低廉的。等将来完全改做或大部分做水泥楼板而取消或少做木地板时，因有原单价作为依据，那么，与自己有勾结的营造商，日后即可大大加账，取得非法利润。第六个办法是在设计中互通情报，从材料上打主意。如故意在设计中采用缺货的材料，但在施工时改用别种材料代替。有时，这些工程人员又可根据与自己勾结的营造商的有利条件，按照他现有的某种规格的材料进行设计，好让对方沾光，便于从中取利。也有把将来需要用的大批材料，密告对方提早准备，使对方能操纵把持的。以上这六种作弊方法，非内行人，是不易觉察出来的。防止的办法，最主要的是事前对图样及计算书多加审核；而事后的施工检查也很重要。另外，加账的手续应十分严格；对于有关的情报，也应注意保密。
    在预算方面的舞弊，不外故意把工作数量及单价做大，预留作弊的余地。特别是在较难捉摸的部分。如：桥梁及水利工程的防水费和一般工程的设备管理费，有很大的伸缩性，极易多估以蒙蔽别人。材料可多估损耗；人工本无一定标准，也可以特别宽打。房屋建筑中的水电和暖气工程，是一种专门技术，很容易作弊。土石方工程中的运输距离，也可胡乱计算，因而加大运费。修理工程的估价，很难做到正确，因而，也是易于舞弊的。防止造假预算的方法，除应注意核算及检查外，并须多方比较，掌握规律。
    招标中的圈套
    在设计完毕后，接着就是招标。被收买了的工程人员，在招标中千方百计地制造在和自己勾结的营造商得标的机会，以便于他们偷工减料和牟取暴利。首先，这些工程人员用种种限制的手段，使别的营造商不能参加投标。如把招标的公布日期展缓、缩短，使别人措手不及。别的营造商来领标时，这些工程人员推说已领完或已过期，不给图说标单。有时又规定投标人的特殊经历和资格，使之和自己勾结的营造商的条件恰巧相符，而别人则不能被认为合格。其次，当这些工程人员和各投标商人都有关系时，就采取“抬轿子”的方法。他们彼此之间，早有联系，互相轮流得标；但在表面上要做个形式，组织了好几家营造商投标。在这种情况下，这些工程人员也早把预算加大了，即使承包价并不太高，也可在偷工减料中找到暴利。万一有一家和工程人员没有关系的营造商参加进来，并且估价最低而得标了，这些工程人员就和有关系的包商勾结，弄得这家营造商大亏其本，使他以后再也不敢尝试了。其三，招标时尚可开“软标”，其方法常常是在开标后保留较低标数家，这时，这些工程人员看到和自己勾结的一家所投的虽然不是最低标，但估价尚低，即可邀约其他保留的各家营造商谈话，迫使其他的营造商再行自动让步；或提出其他条件，使别人不敢应允；或临时定出种种限制办法，如比较经历、资本、保证人、工作能力及完工期限等，以期使和自己勾结的一家中选。其四，出卖标底。这种方法，常适用于采取合理标时。所谓合理标，并不以估价最低为标准，目的是怕营造商开烂账，把标价估得太大或过小，对工程不利；但因为和工程人员有勾结的营造商早已知道标底了，所以只有这家营造商能最接近自己的预算，因此，就可稳稳当当地得标。这种出卖标底的办法，即使在不采取合理标而仍采取最低标的情况下，由于营造商已掌握标底，他们也是容易得标的。有时这些工程人员故意在标单内不列明各项工料数量，让别的投标人自己去算；但和自己勾结的营造商却有原预算可以照抄。这样，这家营造商就容易获得承包权。或者故意让对方漏账估低标价，因而先行得标，然后再想办法给这家营造商加账，以从中偷盗国家财产。此外，监标人和工程人员共同作弊，他们还可以把和自己勾结的营造商的一标，在最后以比较别家最低标价还要少一些的数字发表。这样，这家营造商必能得标无疑。如果工程是委托代办，和营造商勾结的工程人员，更可直接指定承办者，对方不仅可以偷工减料，并可拿得高额代办费。在招标过程中，如能严格掌握并发挥监标人的作用，就可以预先识破这些诡计。
    三位一体的偷工减料
    施工是一个工程的主要步骤。施工不好，直接影响建筑物的质量。但是，营造商却把施工作为他们盗窃国家资财、破坏国家基本建设的主要一环。营造商串通监工员和把头，三位一体，用偷工减料的手段，达到他们盗窃国家财产的目的。他们偷工减料的方法很多，有的专注意几门大的；有的是积少成多。大致大包的（包工包料）主要偷料，小包的
    （包工不包料）主要偷工。但是，不论偷工或是减料，大都常在工程最关紧要的地方。
    偷工的方法有两个，一是多报工数和工价；二是粗制滥造。前者是公开的盗窃；后者是暗害性的破坏，它的危险性更大。木工方面的粗制滥造，多半是在镶、接、拼、?上草率从事；如应用?头镶接部分，改用洋钉钉牢，影响美观尚是小事，妨害安全则更为严重。泥工方面的粗制滥造，花样更多。三七灰土或灰浆三和土是建筑物的基础，但他们不肯调拌均匀；应分几次倒入沟槽，他们却把次数减少；夯打不结实；不把碎砖敲小；不把浆水浇足。在砌砖墙时，他们不叫工人注意浇水括斗；不叫工人用满刀灰；不叫工人拉线校正垂直和水平，不叫工人避免接缝重叠。建筑工程所以要用钢筋水泥，就是为了坚固耐久。但是，他们在拌水泥时，不要工人将黄沙石子洗净；不检去草根杂物，不肯适度加水并切实拌匀。扎钢筋时，他们不叫工人扎牢。以致地位不准确，易于松动，削弱了应有的强度。钢筋水泥捣好后，他们又不肯多等几天，接着就在上面做其他工程，并且太早地拆去壳子板或支撑木料，减少了工程的坚固性。做粉刷工作时，他们不等候第一道粉刷稍干，接着就做第二道；粉括又不平直，易致裂缝剥落。他们甚至把桩子难以打入的部分，偷偷地锯掉，只图省工，不顾建筑物的稳固。
    减料往往要结合偷工；对建筑物的耐久和巩固，是一种最严重的损害。他们减料的主要方面，一是贵重的材料，二是不易被人发觉的材料。如偷钢筋，故意在壳子板内把钢筋扎成活络，以便在检验后随时抽去，但是，当时是不易发觉他们的意图的。偷水泥的方法，是把三合土的成份改变，减少水泥用量。原规定用一（水泥）、二（黄沙）、四（石子）的比例，可是，他们做了一、三、六；规定一、三、六，却做了一、四、八。量黄沙石子用箩筐，量水泥用木斗，筐与斗已经不能成为准确的比例，再加上用筐量时装得满满的，用斗量时装得既松而浅，还要不倾倒干净，斗内再搪些水，粗看水泥装得好像很足，但实际在斗底的一部分老是黏结着倒不出来，减少了斗的应有容积。底脚工料更是易偷，主要是把地槽的深度和宽度减少，这样，三合土就可少做，既偷了料，又省了工。偷木料的方法也很多。或是将排列中距放大，如打桩、平顶筋、板墙筋、以及櫊栅等，都可按照这样办法减少实用的根数；或是在难检查的部分，干脆将用料的尺寸和规格改变，应用粗的换细的，应用方的换圆的，并降低材料的品质，把有腐烂洞疤的木料当好料用；对于油漆工作，偷工减料的方法尤其五花八门，俗称“漆糊涂”，更难检查出毛病来。此外，木料与木料接触部分，不涂足水柏油；防潮油毛毡的接头处，没有用松香柏油胶贴更是常事。钢筋、水泥、木料、油毛毡等，都是比较贵重的材料；若由营造商负担，当然要被他偷减少用，若自备供给，也易被他多估冒领，偷去盗卖，任何材料，都可把次货当好货，涂些红丹油漆，便可偷天换日，欺骗外行人了。
    监工人员多半是工程人员，直接对设计工程师负责；如果设计工程师和营造商没有勾结，营造商的偷工减料，还不敢太猖狂。但是在大多数情况下，他们是彼此串通一气的。所以，要防止营造商偷工减料，只有提高监工人员的政治觉悟，加强他们爱护国家财产的责任感。
    掩盖劣迹，混过最后一关
    工程完工了，营造商勾结工程人员，照例要大捞一把。这时主要在加账中作弊。应加的当然照加，不应加的也就加了；非但应减账的不减，为了无中生有，更会捏造事实，凭空虚报。在材料上，临时工上，日常开支上，他们大都造假单据报销。至于工程的验收工作，营造商更容易过关；只要工程人员点头了，别的人是不容易看出毛病来的。而且，建筑物的外表已被加上一番粉饰，破坏恶劣部分都已被掩盖起来，验收人员更不易发觉了。过了一个雨季之后，工程的千孔百疮都出来了。这时，虽然把原承包商找着了，但是，对国家的损失，却已经造成了。
