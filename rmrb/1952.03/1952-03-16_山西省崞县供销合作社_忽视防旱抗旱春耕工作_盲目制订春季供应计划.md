To the Editor: The leading cadres of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Guoxian County, Shanxi Province, have serious bureaucratic work styles. They blindly formulate supply plans, and do not care about drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring ploughing, which has caused great dissatisfaction among cooperative members. The cooperative did not conduct in-depth investigations beforehand, nor did it maintain close contact with the government, and blindly formulated spring supply plans, so it could not meet the actual needs of the cooperative members. For example, the county needs 13,000 jin of wheat seed mixing wine, but only 1,000 jin was budgeted. They originally only planned to supply wet DDT to the fruit tree area, but they distributed it to all nine districts of the county. At the county's water conservancy representative meeting, the masses requested a supply of 210 waterwheels, but only 60 were included in the plan. Corn threshers, rice threshers, etc. are not needed at all now, but they are included in the spring supply plan. More seriously, the government has already allocated medicines, machinery, and fertilizers from the province to the special commissioner's office, but the Guoxian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative is not even aware of this. They have also not paid good attention to helping the masses sell local products.

The above facts show that the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the Guoxian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative is very serious. They neither care about the lives of the masses nor understand the specific situation, which will seriously affect spring ploughing production and should be corrected immediately.

    山西省崞县供销合作社
    忽视防旱抗旱春耕工作  盲目制订春季供应计划
    编辑同志：山西省崞县供销合作社的领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风。他们盲目制订供应计划，不关心防旱、抗旱、春耕工作，引起社员群众极大不满。该社事先不作深入调查，又不和政府取得密切联系，就盲目地制订了春季供应计划，因而不能满足社员的实际需要。如全县共需小麦拌种酒一万三千斤，但只预算一千斤。原来只准备供给果木区用的湿性滴滴涕，他们却分配给全县九个区。在全县水利代表会上，群众要求供给二百一十辆水车，但在计划中只订了六十辆。玉米脱粒机、打稻机等现在根本用不着，但他们却把它列入春季供应计划中。更严重的是，政府已把药械、肥料由省拨到专署，崞县供销合作社还不知道这回事。他们对帮助群众推销土产工作，也没有很好注意。
    以上事实，说明崞县供销合作社领导干部的官僚主义作风是很严重的。他们既不关心群众的生活，又不了解具体情况，这将严重地影响春耕生产，应该立即纠正。
