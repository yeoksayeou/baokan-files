    ▲ In the Huai River spring project, the excavation of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal has started in full swing earlier than other projects. The spring construction plan for the Subei Irrigation Main Canal is very large in scale. The number of migrant workers participating in the construction last winter was 500,000, and now it is 800,000. In order to ensure the completion of this construction plan without delaying spring plowing and production, Taizhou, Yancheng and other special districts started mobilizing and organizing migrant workers very early. The broad masses of farmers are also very active, and they have all formulated plans that combine Huai River harnessing with production, ensuring neither is neglected. Farmers have also organized mutual aid teams combining Huai River harnessing and spring plowing and production. For example, the Ji Penghao mutual aid team in Huaian County has 27 laborers, and they divided into 13 people led by Ji Penghao to harness the Huai River, while the remaining people were led by the deputy leader to carry out spring plowing and production at home.
    ▲ The East China Military and Political Committee issued instructions on February 26 on vigorously carrying out spring repair work for water conservancy. The instructions pointed out that governments and water conservancy departments at all levels should immediately mobilize the masses of farmers to vigorously carry out spring repair work for water conservancy under the principle of not hindering the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, to ensure that irrigation projects can be used during spring plowing and planting, and that flood control projects can be completed before the flood season.
    Regarding the various spring repair projects for water conservancy in the East China region this year, the instructions pointed out that in addition to earth and stone work, there are also many building projects. These projects are related to farmland irrigation this year, or related to flood control and transportation, and construction procedures, construction progress, and material transportation plans must be formulated in advance. The people's governments of all provinces and regions must attach great importance to these projects and ensure that they are completed on schedule. Various preparatory work before construction should be carefully arranged and checked in various places; during the construction process, supervision and inspection of the project should be strengthened to strictly prevent contractors from cutting corners.
    ▲ Since last winter, farmers in southern Anhui have seized the slack winter season to actively build farmland water conservancy projects. In addition to repairing dikes and embankments, farmers throughout the region are also vigorously building ponds and dams to store water and prevent drought. The main dikes in the Chizhou Special District are being repaired, and 140,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. Thirteen large dikes in the Xuancheng Special District have started renovation, and farmers in various counties have started construction on 101 small dikes. The work of repairing ponds and building dams in the entire region has also formed a mass upsurge.
    ▲ A mass movement to build farmland water conservancy has been widely launched in the northern Anhui region. Since December of last year, farmers in northern Anhui have begun activities such as digging ponds, building dams, repairing dikes, and digging ditches. As of now, more than 641,800 farmers in twelve counties including Wuwei, He County, Hanshan, Chaoxian, Lujiang, Feidong, Feixi, Huaining, Wangjiang, Dingyuan, Luan, and Huoqiu have participated in small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. More than 300,000 migrant workers in seven counties of the Chaohu Special District completed more than 3.8 million cubic meters of earthwork in twenty days from December 5th to 25th last year.
    The broad masses of farmers in northern Anhui have all listed the task of building farmland water conservancy as an important part of their patriotic covenants. The patriotic covenant of farmers in the Da Ying District of Lai'an County not only stipulates that the ponds should be repaired well, but also that the pond mud dug out should be used as fertilizer for wheat fields to ensure a 20% increase in production this year. Farmers in the Xuqiao District of Taihu County want to repair all the ponds in the district, so that each pond can hold an average of two feet more water than before, ensuring that vast areas of farmland are not affected by drought for a month without rain.
    ▲ The Henan Provincial People's Government's Production and Drought Prevention Office was established on February 19, with Xu Xilian, Director of the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry, serving as Director. After the establishment of the office, it has transferred 46 cadres from the Provincial People's Government to form five inspection teams, led by Liu Xiaoran, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, to go to various special districts to inspect the preparation work for spring plowing and drought prevention.
    ▲ Heavy snow in northwestern regions. The snow accumulation in various parts of Guanzhong, Shaanxi Province, is four or five inches thick, and in Liquan and Xunyi counties in the Xianyang Special District, the snow accumulation is as thick as one foot. The snow accumulation in eastern Gansu Province is five or six inches, and in Yinchuan, Ningxia Province, it is two inches. Farmers in northwestern regions have responded to the emergency call of the Northwest Production and Drought Prevention Committee and launched a tense snow sweeping and snow accumulation movement.

    ▲治淮春季工程中，开挖苏北灌溉总渠的工程已先于其他工程全面动工了。苏北灌溉总渠的春季施工计划规模很大。去冬参加修工的民工是五十万，现在是八十万。为保证完成这期施工计划，又不耽误春耕生产，泰州、盐城等专区很早就已着手动员和组织民工。广大农民也很积极，他们都已订有治淮、生产两不误的计划。农民并组织了治淮和春耕生产结合的互助组，如淮安县纪彭高互助组有二十七个劳动力，他们便分十三个人由纪彭高带领去治淮，其余的人由副组长领导在家春耕生产。
    ▲华东军政委员会在二月二十六日发出了关于大力开展水利春修工作的指示。指示指出：各级人民政府和水利部门，要在不妨碍反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的原则下，立即动员农民群众大力开展水利春修工作，保证灌溉工程能在春耕春种时用水，防洪工程能在汛期前完成。
    关于华东区今年的各项水利春修工程，指示指出：除土方石方工程外，建筑物工程也不少。这些工程关系于今年的农田灌溉，或关系于防洪和交通，必须在事先拟订好施工程序、施工进度和调运器材等计划。各省区人民政府必须十分重视这些工程，保证如期修成。施工前的各项准备工作，各地应作周密的布置和检查；施工过程中，要加强工程的监督和检查，严防包商偷工减料。
    ▲去冬以来，皖南各地农民抓紧冬闲时期积极地兴修农田水利工程。全区农民除修堤圩以外，并大力兴修塘坝蓄水防旱。池州专区的各主要圩堤都在培修，已完成土方十四万公方。宣城专区有十三个大圩堤已动工整修，各县农民自修的小圩已有一百零一处动工。全区修塘筑坝工作也已形成一个群众性的热潮。
    ▲群众性的兴修农田水利运动，已在皖北区广泛展开。从去年十二月以来，皖北农民就已开始挑塘、打坝、修堤和挖沟等活动。截至目前，无为、和县、含山、巢县、庐江、肥东、肥西、怀宁、望江、定远、六安、霍邱等十二个县，已有六十四万一千八百多农民参加小型农田水利工程。巢湖专区七个县的三十多万民工，在去年十二月五日到二十五日的二十天中，就完成了三百八十多万公方土工。
    皖北广大农民都把兴修农田水利的任务列为爱国公约的重要内容。来安县大英区农民的爱国公约中，不只规定要修好水塘，并且要把挖出的塘泥做麦田肥料，保证今年增产二成。太湖县徐桥区农民要把全区的塘都修好，使每个塘平均比原来多装二尺水，保证广大农田一个月无雨不受旱。
    ▲河南省人民政府生产防旱办公室已在二月十九日成立，由河南省人民政府农林厅厅长许西连任主任。办公室成立后，已从省人民政府抽调干部四十六人组成五个检查组，由农林厅副厅长刘潇然领导，分赴各专区检查春耕、防旱准备工作。
    ▲西北各地大雪。陕西省关中各地积雪都有四、五寸厚，咸阳专区醴泉、栒邑县一带，积雪厚达一尺。甘肃省陇东积雪五、六寸，宁夏省银川二寸。西北各地农民已响应西北生产防旱委员会的紧急号召，展开了紧张的扫雪、积雪运动。
