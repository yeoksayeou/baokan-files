(Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th) News from Tokyo: In order to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism, the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan, under the direction of the American occupation authorities, has successively unpurged more than nine-tenths of the approximately 200,000 militarists who were originally purged, restoring their civil rights and opening the door for their re-employment.

In the second half of 1950, the Yoshida government, in accordance with the orders of the occupation authorities, established the so-called "Public Office Qualification Appeal Review Committee," which was specifically responsible for the work of unpurging militarists. From October 13, 1950, to October 31, 1951, during a period of more than a year, the Yoshida government, based on the so-called "review" results of the committee, successively announced eight lists of unpurged persons. The total number of militarists who were unpurged reached more than 177,000. Only 18,000 people were not unpurged, less than one-tenth of the total. Most of them were war criminals with notorious crimes and former high-ranking Japanese military officers.

As the United States intensifies the rearmament of Japan, the Yoshida government formulated a new "law" in November of last year, relaxing the scope of unpurging and re-establishing the "Public Office Qualification Appeal Review Committee" to exonerate those war criminals who have not yet been unpurged. From February 8th to March 4th of this year, the Yoshida government announced four more lists of unpurged persons, unpurging more than 1,100 war criminals, many of whom were invaders of China stained with the blood of the Chinese people and former Japanese general-level officers, such as: Arita Hachiro, former "diplomatic advisor" to the puppet Wang Jingwei regime, Ugaki Kazushige, former Governor-General of Korea, Okada Keisuke, former Prime Minister, Takeshita Isamu, Hyakutake Saburo, Fujita Hisanori, former naval admirals, and Yasui Fujiji, former lieutenant general of the army. Hundreds of notoriously infamous former Japanese military police personnel have been restored to their civil rights, and even former Japanese secret service chiefs - Hashimoto Seikichi, the chief of the "Keiho Bureau," and Usuda Bishō, the "Superintendent General" of Tokyo - are also on the list of those being unpurged. On February 29, the Yoshida government's "Public Office Qualification Appeal Review Committee" continued to conduct so-called reviews of 845 purged individuals, and has preliminarily decided to unpurge war criminals such as Godo Takuo, former Minister of Commerce and Industry, Nomura Kichisaburo, former Admiral of the Navy, and Kobayashi Seizo, former Governor-General of Taiwan.

Not only that, but the Yoshida government is secretly plotting with Ridgway Headquarters to completely unpurge Japanese fascists. According to Kyodo News, the Yoshida government has decided to completely abolish the purge system. This decision will first be discussed at the cabinet meeting on the 7th. After obtaining the consent of Ridgway Headquarters, the Yoshida government will submit a bill to the Diet for implementation. In this way, "the purge implemented under the purge order will be completely abolished," and "all restrictions on actions currently imposed on those being purged will be lifted."

After unpurging the fascists, the Yoshida government blatantly employed them to revive Japanese militarism and rearm Japan. For example, Sadao Iguchi, who served as the Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the war, was appointed by the Yoshida government as the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs after being unpurged, actively participating in the conclusion of the separate peace treaty, the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement." Eight hundred officers of the rank of lieutenant colonel and captain were transferred to work in the "Police Reserve Force" shortly after being unpurged.

Even war criminals who have not yet been announced to be unpurged are actually participating in the activities of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to rearm Japan. Nomura Kichisaburo, Kobayashi Seizo, Shimomura Sada, former Minister of the Army, and Tatsumi Eiichi, former Lieutenant General of the Army, are in fact all long-time military advisors to Yoshida, responsible for planning the reconstruction of the Japanese armed forces. This is an open secret. (Attached picture)

    美日反动派加紧重新武装日本的罪恶活动
    大批日本军国主义分子被非法解除整肃
    侵华战犯多人于解除整肃后参与了重新武装日本的罪行
    【新华社八日讯】东京消息：为了加紧复活日本军国主义，日本吉田反动政府在美国占领当局的指使下，已将原被整肃的约二十万名军国主义分子的十分之九以上陆续解除整肃，恢复他们的公权，为重新起用他们开了方便之门。
    一九五○年下半年，吉田政府根据占领当局的命令，成立了所谓“公职资格诉愿审查委员会”，专门负责对军国主义分子解除整肃的工作。从一九五○年十月十三日到一九五一年十月三十一日的一年多期间，吉田政府根据该委员会所谓“审查”的结果，竟先后宣布了八次解除整肃的名单，被解除整肃的军国主义分子共达十七万七千人以上。剩下未被解除整肃者仅一万八千人，不到全体的十分之一，他们大多是恶行昭著的战争罪犯和前日军高级将领。
    随着美国加紧重新武装日本，吉田政府在去年十一月间又制订了新“法律”，放宽解除整肃的范围，重新成立“公职资格诉愿审查委员会”，为那些还未被解除整肃的战犯开脱。从今年二月八日到三月四日，吉田政府又宣布了四次解除整肃名单，对一千一百多名战犯解除整肃，其中有许多都是双手沾染着中国人民的鲜血的侵华战犯和前日本将级军官，例如：前汪逆精卫傀儡政权的“外交顾问”有田八郎，前朝鲜总督宇垣一成，前首相冈田启介，前海军大将竹下勇、百武三郎、藤田尚德等，以及前陆军中将安井藤治等。成百的臭名远扬的前日本宪兵人员都已被恢复公权，甚至前日本特务头子——“警保局”局长桥本清吉、东京“警视总监”薄田美朝等——也在被解除整肃之列。二月二十九日，吉田政府的“公职资格诉愿审查委员会”继续对八百四十五名被整肃者进行所谓审查，并已初步决定对前商工相伍堂卓雄、前海军大将野村吉三郎、前台湾总督小林跻造等战犯解除整肃。
    不仅如此，吉田政府正与李奇微总部密谋对日本法西斯分子全部解除整肃。据共同社透露，吉田政府已决定完全废除整肃制度。这个决定将首先在七日的内阁会议讨论，在获得李奇微总部的同意后，吉田政府将向国会提出法案，付之实行。这样一来，“根据整肃令而实行的整肃就将完全废除”，现在对被整肃者所规定的“一切行动限制都将撤销”。
    吉田政府在解除法西斯分子的整肃之后，就明目张胆地起用他们为复活日本军国主义、重新武装日本而工作。例如，战时曾任外务省情报局长的井口贞夫，在被解除整肃之后就被吉田政府聘任为外务省次官，积极参与缔结单独和约、美日“安全条约”和“行政协定”的工作。八百名佐级（校级）和尉级的军官被解除整肃之后不久，就转入“警察后备队”工作。
    即使是还没有被宣布解除整肃的战犯，实际上也已在参与美、日反动派重新武装日本的活动。野村吉三郎、小林跻造、前陆相下村定以及前陆军中将辰己荣一等人，事实上都早就是吉田的军事顾问，担任着策划重建日本武装部队的工作，这已是公开的秘密了。（附图片）
