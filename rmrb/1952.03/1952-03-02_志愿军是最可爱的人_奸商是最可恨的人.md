    The Volunteers Are the Most Beloved People
    The Treacherous Merchants Are the Most Hateful People
    Gu Zhong, Worker at Shenyang Machine Factory No. 12
    Reading in the newspaper about the treacherous merchant Li Yinting stealing 10,000 jin of good cotton from the public and using rotten cotton to make emergency bandages for the Volunteers, and Zhang Xingen collecting stinking meat and passing it off as good meat to sell to the Volunteers, I was furious. I wished I could grab them and bite them a few times. Because of the heroic fighting of the Volunteers on the Korean front, our people have today's peace and happiness, can produce safely, and capitalists can make money doing business. The workers in our factory have all signed patriotic covenants, working hard from dawn to dusk to step up production. The first article of the patriotic covenant is to support our most beloved people—the Volunteers—with all practical actions. In order to further enhance the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, we also contribute one day's work each month. Even my little son, Dapeng, who is just five years old, saves one hundred yuan of his pocket money every day. He said to me naively, "Volunteer uncles are fighting in Korea and their lives are very hard. I eat my fill every day and don't need to spend money. I want to send my daily pocket money to the volunteer uncles. When the American devils are defeated, Dad can give me pocket money again!" See, even a five-year-old child knows how to love the motherland and love the Volunteers. But the treacherous merchants Li Yinting, Zhang Xingen, etc., are no different from those pot-bellied capitalists on Wall Street. They only seek personal wealth and enjoyment, and their bloody claws grab everywhere! If they had even a shred of conscience, how could they bear to harm the Volunteers who are defending our country? Such people must be promptly and severely punished.
    Li Yinting, Zhang Xingen, and other treacherous merchants who harmed the Volunteers have all been caught one
    by one. The movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of national economic intelligence is like
    a demon-revealing mirror, and all the demons and monsters have been exposed in the movement. I am extremely grateful for Chairman Mao's wise leadership. If we do not repel the bourgeoisie's attack in time, what great losses will the country suffer! I will definitely actively respond to Chairman Mao's call, break through all misgivings in the movement, and wage a merciless struggle against treacherous merchants and grafters. I will also actively complete the major task of increasing production and practicing economy.

    志愿军是最可爱的人
    奸商是最可恨的人
    沈阳市机器十二厂工人  顾众
    看到报上登载奸商李寅廷偷去公家一万斤好棉花，而用烂棉花给志愿军做救急包，张新根收拢臭肉冒充好肉卖给志愿军等消息，我气愤得要命。我恨不得立刻抓住他们咬他们几口。有了志愿军在朝鲜前线英勇战斗，我们祖国人民才有今天的和平幸福，才能够安全地生产，资本家也才能够做生意赚钱。我们厂的工人们都订立了爱国公约，起早贪黑地加紧生产。爱国公约的第一条就是用一切实际行动支援我们最可爱的人——志愿军。为了更多地增强抗美援朝的力量，我们每月还献一天工。就连我那刚刚五岁的小儿子大鹏，每天也把一百元的零花钱节省下来了。他天真地对我说：“志愿军叔叔在朝鲜打仗，生活很苦，我每天吃得饱饱的，用不着花钱，我要把每天的零花钱送给志愿军叔叔。等把美国鬼子打垮，爸爸再给我零花钱吧！”看，五岁的小孩都知道爱祖国，爱志愿军。但是奸商李寅廷、张新根等却和华尔街那些大肚子资本家简直没有两样。他们只图个人发财享乐，两只血爪子到处乱抓！如果他们还有一丝一毫的良心，怎能忍心向保家卫国的志愿军下毒手呢？对这种人一定要迅速地严厉惩办。
    李寅廷、张新根和其他暗害志愿军的奸商都一个
    一个地落网了。反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动好像
    一面照妖镜，什么妖魔鬼怪都在运动中露了原形。我万分感谢毛主席的英明领导。如果我们不及时地打退资产阶级的进攻，国家会遭受多大的损失啊！我一定积极响应毛主席的号召，在运动中打破一切顾虑，向奸商向贪污分子进行无情的斗争。我还要积极来完成增产节约的重大任务。
