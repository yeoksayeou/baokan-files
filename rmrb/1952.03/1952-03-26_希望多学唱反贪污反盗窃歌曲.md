    Hoping to Learn and Sing More Songs Against Corruption and Theft
    I have participated in many anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle meetings. Before the meetings, comrades enthusiastically sang songs, but most of the time we sang songs like "Unity is Strength," "Ode to the Motherland," and "Volunteer Army March." These songs are all very good, but they are not closely aligned with the current movement. I suggest that local agencies, organizations, and trade unions should make every effort to mobilize the masses to learn songs that complement the current movement. Now, local people's radio stations are teaching these kinds of songs. For example, Beijing People's Radio Station has already taught seven songs, and the People's Daily also published the song "Beat Back the Frenzied Attack of the Bourgeoisie" on March 23. I hope comrades will learn these new songs in a timely manner in order to enhance and expand the propaganda effect, boost morale, and strengthen our confidence in victory!

    希望多学唱反贪污反盗窃歌曲
    我参加过不少次反贪污反盗窃的斗争大会，会前同志们都热情地唱着歌子，但是大多数会上总是唱“团结就是力量”、“歌唱祖国”、“志愿军战歌”等歌曲。这些歌子都是很好的，然而并不是紧密地配合当前运动的。我建议各地机关、团体和工会组织，尽量发动群众学习配合当前运动的歌曲。现在各地人民广播电台，都在教唱这类歌曲，如北京人民广播电台已经教唱七支，人民日报在三月二十三日也刊载了“打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻”的歌曲，希望同志们及时学习这些新歌，以便增强和扩大宣传效果，鼓舞斗志，坚定胜利信心！
