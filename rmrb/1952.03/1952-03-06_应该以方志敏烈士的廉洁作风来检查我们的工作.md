    We Should Examine Our Work with Comrade Fang Zhimin's Integrity

    To the Editor: We read Comrade Fang Zhimin's posthumous work "Poverty" published in the People's Daily on February 22nd with boundless love and respect. The revolutionary martyr's perseverance, integrity, heroism, and enthusiasm deeply educated us. We must learn from the spirit of the martyrs and serve the people wholeheartedly.

    However, in the same issue of the People's Daily, we also saw the self-criticisms of Shao Shiping, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government, and Vice-Chairmen Fan Shiren and Fang Zichun regarding their bureaucratic work style. What is most distressing is that in 1950, the higher-level government, in order to care for the descendants of martyrs and allow them to study well so that they could inherit the martyrs' legacy and better serve the people in the future, specifically allocated 6 million jin of grain to the Jiangxi Provincial Martyrs' Children's School as school funding. Unexpectedly, this grain was not distributed but became a surplus in 1950 and was falsely reported to the higher-level government as part of the 1950 financial settlement. This practice is intolerable. We should do our best to help the families of martyrs solve their difficulties to support and educate them. However, the leading cadres of Jiangxi Province are aloof and only care about their own departmentalism, blind to the needs of the martyrs' children for education and upbringing. This is forgetting the blood of revolutionary martyrs and forgetting our political tasks.

    We should examine our work today from the spirit of Comrade Fang Zhimin.

### 应该以方志敏烈士的廉洁作风来检查我们的工作

    应该以方志敏烈士的廉洁作风来检查我们的工作
    编辑同志：我们以无比热爱和尊敬的心情，读了二月二十二日人民日报上所登载的方志敏烈士的遗著“清贫”。革命先烈的坚苦、廉洁、英勇、热情，深深地教育了我们。我们必须学习先烈的精神，全心全意为人民服务。
    但是，我们在同一天的人民日报上，又看到江西省人民政府主席邵式平和副主席范式人、方志纯关于官僚主义作风的检讨。其中最使人痛心的是：一九五零年上级政府为了爱护烈士的后代，让他们好好学习，以使他们将来能够继承烈士遗志，更好地为人民服务，特拨给江西省烈士子弟学校六百万斤粮食，作为该校经费。岂知该项粮食竟未发下，而变成一九五零年的节余，并当作一九五零年的决算浮报上级政府。这种做法，令人难以容忍。我们对烈士的家属本应尽力帮助他们解决困难，来抚养他们，教育他们。而江西省的领导干部，却高高在上，只顾闹本位主义，看不见烈士子弟们的需要教养。这是忘掉了革命烈士的鲜血，忘掉了我们的政治任务。
    我们应该从方志敏烈士的精神来检查我们今天的工作。
