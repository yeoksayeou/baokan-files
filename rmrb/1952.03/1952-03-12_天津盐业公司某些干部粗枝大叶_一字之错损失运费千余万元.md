    Some Cadres of Tianjin Salt Company Careless
    One-Character Mistake Causes Loss of Over Ten Million Yuan in Freight

    Editor: On February 22nd, the Tianjin Salt Company shipped eight trucks of crude salt to Wulidui, Xiangtan. The company's personnel mistakenly wrote the unloading station "Wulidui" as "Wulidun" (Wulidun is a small station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway between Liling and Zhuzhou, about 33 kilometers from Wulidui, Xiangtan). After the batch of crude salt was transported to Wulidun and unloaded, they realized the mistake and had to reload it and transport it to Wulidui, Xiangtan. This one-character error resulted in a loss of approximately 12 million yuan in loading, unloading, and transportation costs. During this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, it is intolerable that such carelessness continues to cause unnecessary losses. It is recommended that the company conduct a thorough investigation and hold those responsible accountable.

    天津盐业公司某些干部粗枝大叶
    一字之错损失运费千余万元
    编辑同志：天津盐业公司在上月二十二日把八卡车芦盐发运湘潭五里堆。该公司经办人员把卸货站“五里堆”错写成“五里墩”（五里墩是浙赣线醴陵、株州间的一小站，距湘潭五里堆约三十三公里），这批芦盐运到五里墩卸下后，才发觉送错了，只得再装车运往湘潭五里堆。因一字之误，共损失装卸和搬运费约一千二百万元。在此反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，竟因粗枝大叶继续造成不应有的损失，这是令人不能容忍的。建议该公司即作深入检查，追究责任。
