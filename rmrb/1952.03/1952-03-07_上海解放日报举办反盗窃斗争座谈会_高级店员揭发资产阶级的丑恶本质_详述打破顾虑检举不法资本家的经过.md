The Shanghai *Liberation Daily* invited veteran shop assistants and senior staff who had made significant contributions to the anti-theft struggle to a symposium on February 23. The attendees included Qian Zihe (62 years old, accountant at Yongtai Cigarette Shop), Gong Kezhong (56 years old, general affairs at Zhensheng Steel Factory and Yongyi Hardware Store), Wei Guojun (59 years old, accountant at Ruidai Coal Shop), Dong Yuan (chief accountant at Dakang Pharmacy), Huang Yaokui (chief accountant at Xiedaxiang Silk and Cloth Shop), Deng Renfu (director of the business department at Guangrongtai Hardware Store), Jiang Yongshun (accountant and head of the business department at Yichang Steel Products Hardware Store), Xie Rongxiang (accountant at Yongxianghua Firm), Sun Yueqing (involved in dissolution and traveling salesman at Jinfengtai Hardware Store), Jin Zukang (traveling salesman at Shuntai Hardware Store), and Wang Yuzhang (purchasing agent at Shuntai Hardware Store), totaling eleven people.

The shop assistants at the symposium used facts from their own experiences to expose the ugly nature of the bourgeoisie. In his speech, Xie Rongxiang revealed Yongxianghua Firm boss Chen Guozhen's crimes of deceiving state-owned enterprises and corrupting cadres through despicable means, proving that harming others to benefit oneself and pursuing profit at all costs is the nature of the bourgeoisie. Xie Rongxiang said: Yongxianghua Firm is a hardware trading company that speculates on credit. The treacherous merchant Chen Guozhen specializes in acting as a broker, dismantling goods from various manufacturers, then forging trademarks, changing their appearance, and passing them off as imported goods, selling them to state-owned enterprises at high prices. For example, last August, when Chen Guozhen learned that the public-owned Yubei Textile Factory in Pingyuan Province had sent personnel to Shanghai to purchase steel healds, he bought goods from Zhongyuan Company, tore off the domestic trademarks overnight, replaced them with counterfeit American trademarks, and sold them to Yubei Textile Factory at a high price of 168 million yuan, defrauding the state of 28 million yuan. Last October, he again used the method of buying and selling on credit to sell ten sets of ordered steel healds to Shanghai Hongfeng Textile Factory, falsely claiming that he had self-provided foreign exchange and could order Italian goods from abroad, defrauding them of an order deposit of more than 100 million yuan, which has not been delivered to this day. In order to entice cadres, he specially opened a Beibei Consignment Shop on the lower floor of his residence, filled with lighters, cigarette cases, pens, watches, and other commodities. When he invited cadres to his home for dinner, he always let them "visit" first. If the cadres found something they liked and wanted to buy, Chen would squint his eyes and smile, saying, "What's this? Take it and use it." At the same time, he also used his concubine, Zheng Xiaofeng, to peddle sex and corrupt cadres.

Illegal capitalists constantly used petty favors or other means to blur the class consciousness of senior staff, causing these senior staff to help them in their misdeeds. Most of the people who participated in the symposium had fallen for this trick of the treacherous merchants. They only began to wake up and return to the ranks of the working class after receiving class education in the anti-theft struggle. For example, Huang Yaokui said in his speech: The capitalist repeatedly courted me, gave me a generous gift when I got married, and exceptionally gave me a gold lock when my son was born. That's how I fell into the capitalist's trap. Xie Rongxiang said: The treacherous merchant Chen Guozhen used one-fifth of the dry shares to win me over, saying, "You and I are both managers. Anyone can withdraw money with our seals." Jin Zukang said: "I have known the boss of the shop for twenty years, so I have been under the old concept of 'old friend' and couldn't distinguish between our different positions. The boss sometimes gave me small favors, which made me think I should do more for my 'friend.' So I did whatever the boss told me to do." Jiang Yongshun said: "Other employees are not allowed to 'overdraw accounts,' but the boss allowed me to 'overdraw accounts' at will, so I obeyed the capitalist and made false accounts for the treacherous merchant."

After the start of the anti-theft movement, illegal capitalists still used the means of enticement and threats, attempting to get employees to "take the blame" for him. Sun Yueqing said: Jin Fengtai boss Chen Longzhi threatened me and four other employees to stamp his false confession, saying to us: "The illegal act of filling good goods with inferior silk screens was done by you. You should sign and seal my written confession."

Qian Zihe said: Yongtai Cigarette Shop boss Li Liangjie and his son felt guilty and changed their faces, deliberately trying to win me over, saying: "I know your salaries are not enough, and I will give you an extra 40,000 yuan per month in secret subsidies. At the end of the year, you can withdraw another 100,000 yuan from the account." They gave me 50,000 yuan at the time, asking me not to tell about the illegal acts of the firm's evasion of funds and taxes, and threatened me and other employees, saying: "If you report it, all the assets of the firm will be confiscated, and everyone will have no way to live." He specifically pointed to me and said: "You already have a white beard. Where will you go to eat after the shop closes? Will the trade union and the People's Government still want such an old person like you?" Huang Yaokui also revealed the fact that boss Sun Zhaoming personally picked him up in a car to sign a "defensive alliance" of "only talking about the clear, not talking about the hidden." However, these illegal capitalists' conspiracies were exposed along with other crimes after the shop assistants became aware.

Senior staff had many concerns about reporting the boss's illegal activities, but in the anti-theft struggle, they received class education, went through serious ideological struggles, and finally broke through all concerns and stood firm on the position of the working class. Dong Yuan, who reported the treacherous merchant Wang Kangnian for harming the volunteers, said: Before I reported him, I had thought about many questions, but finally they were all resolved. First, I thought that everyone had been working together for several years, and there was some "sentiment"; second, I earned 260 units per month at Dakang, and I couldn't get that high elsewhere; third, if the store closed and I couldn't find a job, it would be terrible; fourth, what if Wang Kangnian used hooligan methods to retaliate against me? Finally, after the education of the Youth League, the help of the trade union, and especially when I thought of the volunteers, I gained courage. Finally, I reported this wicked guy.

Wang Yuzhang said: "Reporting boss Zou Canhai's affairs was going back and forth in my mind. I thought that I had been friends with Zou Canhai for more than ten years. He treated me pretty well and had been polite to me for several years. I earned 260 units per month. When business was good, he also bought wine and meat to treat me. Isn't reporting him 'kicking away the ladder after crossing the river'? Besides, Zou Canhai engaged in smuggling and tax evasion. As long as there was money to be made, he would do anything. If he was reported, wouldn't the store close? At that time, if I lost my job, my family of five would starve? Isn't reporting the boss making fun of my own job and life? After thinking about it again and again, my heart softened again. But then I thought, Zou Canhai 'started from scratch' and now has billions of assets. This money was all obtained by him doing evil, smuggling, evading taxes, and stealing the people's property. He was sinister and vicious to the employees on weekdays, 'someone when needed, no one when not needed.' Didn't he also scold me when business was slow? Why talk about 'sentiment' with such a person? Then I thought that I was eating my own food by my own labor. The Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government promulgated four regulations. Our reporting of treacherous merchants is a patriotic and just action, and we have the government's support. My courage grew stronger. Then I thought that the working class is the leading class, and the treacherous merchants stealing state property is like stealing my own property. Thinking of this, I felt hatred for the treacherous merchant's actions and ashamed of my past cowardly attitude. So I resolutely stood up and fought against the treacherous merchant boss."

Jin Zukang said: In the anti-theft struggle, after learning, I understood this truth: We are the ones who support the boss, not the boss who supports us. We, whether senior staff or general employees, are all exploited. I always think: Is the relationship between me and the boss a personal friendship or a relationship between the exploiting class and the exploited class? There is no question. The relationship between labor and capital is not a friendly relationship, but two different classes. Why is the boss willing to give me a salary of 400 units per month, while the lowest salary for apprentices in the store is only 25 units? Obviously, because I am an important tool for him to make huge profits, the boss pays the price of 400 units per month and can get thousands or tens of thousands of units of illegal profits. And that's how I helped him do bad things. Speaking of "old friend," it is true that when I had not yet joined the store, when I was still working at the customs, the boss thought I was very "well-connected," invited me to see plays, and invited me to dinner. He seemed to be a very good "friend." But after I joined his store as a shop assistant to increase my income, he changed his face. Only when he wanted to use my name to illegally profit did he discuss with me very politely. At other times, wasn't he still a "sinister" boss? What "friendship," what "friend," isn't it all deceiving? The concern about "sentiment" was finally understood after such repeated thinking. In addition, I also thought about the issue of store closure and unemployment. Because I am not young and have no special skills, would my life be difficult in the future if the store collapsed? But after thinking carefully, I am a member of the working class. I have two hands, so I shouldn't have no work to do. At most, my future income will be less than in the past, which is also right. Because my higher income in the past was a part of the boss's shameful profiteering and was dirty. I also thought that the anti-theft struggle was originally for the long-term interests of the working class and the broad masses of the people, and I should no longer haggle over my personal temporary interests. At this time, I went to see the movie "Soviet Armenia" again. In the added newsreel, I saw the heinous crimes of the treacherous merchant Liu Yuanjing. I was extremely angry, which made my position even firmer. Then, the happy life of the Soviet people reflected in that Soviet movie made me think: Such a beautiful society is exactly the epitome of our tomorrow, and it is exactly what the working class and all working people have created. If we don't work together today to do a good job in the anti-theft movement, how can we build our great motherland well? Thinking step by step like this, I finally understood my thinking, and I became brave.

After returning to their ranks, the veteran shop assistants and senior staff who participated in the symposium reported many serious illegal activities of illegal capitalists. Xie Rongxiang went to the trade union to report the crimes of the treacherous merchant Chen Guozhen, and talked non-stop from 5:30 in the evening until 3:00 the next morning without finishing. After returning, while continuing to collect materials, he contacted the police station to monitor the treacherous merchant Chen Guozhen. Wei Guojun used the Spring Festival holiday to write a letter of accusation, writing for four consecutive days, totaling eleven sheets of paper. Deng Renfu and all the employees of Guangrongtai Hardware Store launched a face-to-face struggle with the illegal capitalist, and now they have reported more than 80 crimes committed by boss He Lisheng and others. Jin Zukang and other shop assistants of Shuntai Hardware Store have reported more than 90 illegal facts committed by the treacherous merchant. At the symposium for elderly workers and senior shop assistants in the Old Gate District on the evening of February 16, Jin Zukang also reported a case of more than 500 million yuan that only he and the boss knew about.

    上海解放日报举办反盗窃斗争座谈会
    高级店员揭发资产阶级的丑恶本质
    详述打破顾虑检举不法资本家的经过
    上海解放日报二月二十三日邀请了在反盗窃斗争中有较大贡献的老年店员和高级职员举行座谈会。出席座谈会的有钱子和（六十二岁，永泰烟栈会计）、龚克衷（五十六岁，振声钢铁厂、永益五金号总务）、魏国钧（五十九岁，瑞大煤号账房）、董渊（大康药房会计主任）、黄耀奎（协大祥绸布庄会计主任）、邓仁甫（广荣泰五金号营业部主任）、江永顺（益锠钢品五金号会计及营业部负责人）、谢荣祥（永祥华行会计）、孙岳青（锦丰泰五金号拆伙和跑街）、金祖康（顺泰五金号跑街）、王裕章（顺泰五金号进货）等十一人。
    参加座谈的店员用亲身经历的事实，揭露了资产阶级的丑恶本质。谢荣祥在发言中揭发永祥华行老板陈国镇用卑鄙手段欺骗国营企业、腐蚀干部的罪行以证明损人利己、唯利是图是资产阶级的本性。谢荣祥说：永祥华行是一家买空卖空的五金商行，奸商陈国镇专以掮客方式向各厂商拆货，然后伪造商标，改头换面，冒充进口货，高价售给国营企业。如去年八月，陈国镇得知平原省公营豫北纱厂派员来上海采购钢丝针布，他就向中元公司买进货，连夜把国货商标撕下，改贴自行伪造的美国商标，以一亿六千八百万元高价售给豫北纱厂，骗取了国家财产二千八百万元。去年十月又以买空卖空方式向上海市鸿丰纱厂抛售订货钢丝针布十套，诡称有自备外汇，可向国外订进意大利货，骗取了订金一亿多元，到现在还没有交货。他为了勾引干部，专门在住宅下层开设了一个蓓蓓寄售行，摆满了打火机、香烟盒、钢笔、手表等商品。当他请干部到家吃饭时，总是先让他们“参观”一回。如果干部发现自己喜爱的东西想买时，陈便眯起眼睛一笑说：“这算什么，拿去用好了。”同时，他还利用小老婆郑小枫卖弄色情，来腐蚀干部。
    不法资本家曾不断用小恩小惠或其他手段模糊高级职员的阶级意识，使这些高级职员帮同他们捣鬼。参加座谈会的人大部曾中过奸商的这一诡计。在反盗窃斗争中受到了阶级教育，才开始醒悟，回到工人阶级队伍中来。如黄耀奎发言说：资方一再拉拢我，在我结婚时送上一笔厚礼，生儿子时又破例地送了金锁片，我就这样上了资本家的圈套。谢荣祥说：奸商陈国镇拿五分之一的干股来笼络我，说：“你我都是经理，凭我们的图章谁都可以支钱。”金祖康说：“我和店里老板结识已二十年，因此一直在‘老朋友’这个旧观念下，分辨不清彼此间不同的立场。老板有时给我小恩小惠，使我认为更应该为‘朋友’办事了。因此老板叫我做啥我就做啥。”江永顺说：“别的职工不能‘宕账’，老板却允许我任意‘宕账’，因此我就听命于资方，替奸商造假账。”
    反盗窃运动开始以后，不法资本家仍然用利诱和威胁的手段，企图让职工替他“背黑锅”。孙岳青说：锦丰泰老板陈隆芝威胁我和另外四个职工在他的假坦白书上盖章，对我们说：“把劣货筛绢充好货的犯法行为是你们干的，应当在我写好的坦白书上签字盖章。”
    钱子和说：永泰烟栈老板黎良杰父子俩做贼心虚，换了一副嘴脸，有意拉拢我，说：“我知道你这几个薪水不够用，另外每月暗贴你四万元，年终时，账里可以再提十万元给你。”当时就给我五万元，要求我不要把行里逃避资金和逃税的犯法行为讲出去，又恐吓我和其他职工说：“假如你们检举，行里的资财全部要罚光，大家就无法生活。”特别指着我说：“你已白须一把了，店关门后到那里去吃饭，难道工会和人民政府还会要你这样老的人吗？”黄耀奎也揭发了老板孙照明亲自用汽车接他去订立“只讲明的，不讲暗的”的“攻守同盟”的事实。但是，这些不法资本家的阴谋活动，在店员觉悟后，和其他罪行同时被揭发出来。
    高级职员检举老板的不法行为是曾经有很多顾虑的，但在反盗窃斗争中，受到了阶级教育，经过严重的思想斗争，终于打破一切顾虑，站稳了工人阶级的立场。检举暗害志愿军的奸商王康年的董渊说：我在检举以前，曾想到过许多问题，但最后都得到了解决。第一，我想到大家在一块搞了好几年，多少有点“情面”；第二，在大康我月薪二百六十个单位，到别处工作，不可能这样高；第三，店一关，自己如果找不到职业，就糟了；第四，王康年如果用流氓手段，对我报复，怎么办？最后经过团的教育、工会的帮助，尤其当我想起了志愿军，就增加了勇气。终于检举了这个万恶的家伙。
    王裕章说：“检举老板邹灿海的事在我脑子里转来转去。我想到自己和邹灿海交‘朋友’已十多年，他待我还不错，几年来对我也客客气气，我每月拿二百六十个单位。遇到生意做开，他还买酒买肉请我吃。检举他不是‘过河拆桥’吗？再说，邹灿海走私漏税，只要有钱赚，什么都干，检举出去，不就要关店？那时候一失业，我一家大小五口，不要饿饭？检举老板不是拿自己的饭碗、性命寻开心？想了又想，我的心又软了。但又一想，邹灿海‘白手成家’，现在拥有几十亿财产，这些钱都是他为非作歹，走私漏税，盗骗人民财产得来的。他平日对待职工阴险毒辣，‘有事有人，无事无人’，生意清淡时，对我不也破口大骂过吗？对这样的人还讲什么‘情面’？再又想到我是靠自己的劳动吃自己的饭，军管会和市人民政府颁布了四项规定，我们检举奸商是爱国的、正义的行动，有政府撑腰，我的胆子就壮了。再想到工人阶级是领导阶级，奸商盗窃国家财产不就像盗窃我自己的财产一样？想到这些，我对奸商的所作所为有了仇恨心，对自己过去的懦弱态度感到了惭愧。于是我坚决地站起来和奸商老板斗争。”
    金祖康说：在反盗窃斗争中，经过学习，我明白了这样一个道理：是我们养活了老板，而不是老板养活了我们。我们，不管高级职员、一般职工，都是被剥削的。我时刻想：我和老板究竟是私人的情谊关系还是剥削阶级和被剥削阶级的关系呢？没有问题，劳资双方不是什么情谊关系，而是两个不同的阶级。老板为什么肯给我每月四百个单位的薪金，而店中学徒最低的薪水却只有二十五个单位？很明显，因为我是他牟取暴利的重要工具，老板付出了每月四百个单位的代价，就能得到几千几万个单位的非法暴利。而我就这样帮着他做了坏事。说是“老朋友”吧，的确当我未进店工作时，当我还在海关工作的时候，老板以为我很“吃得开”，请看戏，请吃饭，似乎确是一副很够“朋友”的面孔。但当我为了增多收入到他的店里当伙计后，他就换了另外一副面孔了。只有当他要借用我的名义非法图利时，才客气非凡地跟我商量，其他时候，还不是一副“阴险”的老板面孔吗？什么“交情”呀，“朋友”呀，还不是骗人的？关于“情面”的顾虑，经过这样反复思考，终于搞通了。另外，也还想到关店失业的问题。因为我年纪已不小，又没有特长，万一店垮了，将来生活是不是要发生困难呢？但我仔细再一想，我是工人阶级的一分子，我有两只手，不至于没有工作做，至多今后的收入比过去少一些，那也是应该的。因为过去我的较高的收入，是老板的可耻暴利中的一部分，是肮脏的。我再想到反盗窃斗争原是为了工人阶级和广大人民的长远利益，我不应该再斤斤较量个人的暂时的利益了。就在这个时候，我又去看了“苏维埃阿尔美尼亚”的电影。在加演新闻片中看到了奸商刘元敬的令人发指的罪行。我愤怒极了，使我的立场更加坚定。接着，那个苏联电影中所映现出来的苏联人民今日的幸福生活，又使我联想到：这样的美好社会，正是我们明天的写照，也正是工人阶级、一切劳动人民所创造出来的。如果今天我们大家不齐心协力地搞好反盗窃运动，怎么能把我们的伟大的祖国建设好呢？这样一步一步地想，我终于搞通了思想，我变得勇敢了。
    参加座谈会的老年店员和高级职员归队后，都曾检举不法资本家的许多严重违法行为。谢荣祥到工会检举奸商陈国镇的罪行，一口气从晚上五点半说到第二天早晨三点还没有说完。回来后，一面继续搜集材料，一面到派出所联系，监视奸商陈国镇。魏国钧利用春节假期写检举信，一连写了四天，共写了十一张纸。邓仁甫和广荣泰五金号的全体职工和不法资本家展开了面对面的斗争，现在已检举出老板何丽生等八十多件罪行。金祖康和顺泰五金号的其他店员已检举了奸商九十多件不法事实。金祖康在二月十六日晚老闸区老年工人、高级店员座谈会上，还检举了只有他和老板两个人知道的一件五亿多元的案子。
