    One Night on the Supply Line
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Ri Hong

    This night was the sixth night of the “Competition Month” launched by the 2nd Transportation Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to guarantee supplies for the front-line troops.

    It was a night of battle. On a snowy road leading to the front lines, a tense and noisy voice was heard: "Hey! Get ready to refuel!"
    "It's almost 4:30, bring the rice porridge!"

    This is the refueling station of the 2nd Transportation Company. Since the beginning of the competition, the comrades of the company headquarters have been refueling the drivers here every night, cooking rice porridge, and spreading the good news of each vehicle. Now the drivers are about to complete their tasks and return, and the people at the refueling station have prepared everything. Braving the blinding snow, they are looking north and discussing with concern:

    "Du Yezhong and Ao Xiangyun might not make it back!"

    Du Yezhong and Ao Xiangyun are drivers of the Fourth Platoon. Du Yezhong has the best driving skills in the entire company, and Ao Xiangyun drives the worst vehicle in the entire company. At the mobilization meeting of the company at the beginning of "Competition Month," each platoon responded to the call of the Communist Party branch to strive to be an "Excellent Platoon." Du Yezhong, representing the Fourth Platoon, challenged the Second Platoon, which had the best performance. The first five nights of the competition passed, and the scores of the Fourth and Second Platoons were always equal. Although it snowed heavily today, Du Yezhong was determined to make three trips. Ao Xiangyun also decided to make two trips, exceeding the performance of the Second Platoon.

    Du Yezhong and his assistant Bai Yongliu made all the preparations during the day. In the evening, they drove the truck onto the ice- and snow-covered highway. The north wind roared. Fearing that he would not hear the air raid warning gun, Du Yezhong lowered the glass on the car door, lifted the ear flaps of his hat, and, regardless of the wind and snow blowing in, stared at the vehicles on the road ahead and drove forward fiercely. Two and a half hours later, they arrived at the grain station. They also helped the staff at the station load the truck, quickly filled it with grain, and immediately went back. At this time, the wind and snow were even greater, the roads were particularly slippery, and there were more vehicles coming and going. In some places, enemy planes routinely hung up "sky lanterns," and bombs were constantly exploding nearby. Du Yezhong was as nervous as if he were in combat. Sometimes he drove very slowly, passing through the gaps between vehicles; sometimes he drove a little faster, like an arrow piercing through places illuminated by flares; sometimes he stuck his head out to listen to the sound of enemy planes overhead; sometimes he stared at the craters on the ground and the dark shadows of vehicles coming head-on. But no matter what, Du Yezhong had only one idea: don't stop for a second.

    Ao Xiangyun was also fighting nervously. The car he was driving had long exceeded its age and was already dilapidated, and half of the cab had collapsed. As soon as the car moved, the wind and snow rushed in, and the snow hitting his face quickly melted. When the wind blew again, frost formed on the brim of his hat, his eyebrows, and the buttons of his clothes. His hands, which were tightly gripping the steering wheel, were already numb. As soon as he moved, the thin ice on his gloves fell off, and his clothes were as frozen as iron armor. The car often broke down on the road. First, the water tank leaked, and then the oil lever became unusable. He had to drive a section and then repair it. Once, the cylinder nozzle broke, and he had to stop by the side of the road to repair it. Furthermore, this car also had to pass other vehicles and rush through places illuminated by flares. When passing other vehicles, he carefully parked the car on the side, shouting loudly to avoid damaging the cars. When rushing through places illuminated by flares, there was not enough water and he could not stop, so he filled a bucket with water, clamped it between his legs, and continued driving forward while using a leather tube to supply water. Many drivers saw that his car was broken and wanted to stop to help him repair it, but he always said, "I'll repair it myself, don't delay your work."

    Just as the people at the refueling station were discussing with concern, Du Yezhong returned for the third time. Then, the sound of motors came from far to near. Along with dazzling lights, one after another truck loaded with grain sped over, and Ao Xiangyun also arrived. Du Yezhong transported more than 33,200 kilograms of grain that night, and Ao Xiangyun also overfulfilled his task. Everyone gathered around the cabs of these two trucks and praised them: "You are truly hero vehicles!"

    供应线上的一夜
    新华社记者  日红
    这一夜，是志愿军某部汽车第二连为了保证前线部队的供应而开展的“竞赛月”的第六夜。
    这是一个战斗之夜。在一条通往前线的风雪道上传出了紧张的嘈杂的人声：“喂！准备加油啊！”
    “快到四点半啦，把稀饭担来呀！”
    这里是汽车第二连的加油站。竞赛开始以后，连部的同志每夜都在这里为司机们加油、烧稀饭和传播各车的好消息。现在司机们快要完成任务返回来了，加油站上的人已经将一切都准备好，正冒着迷眼的风雪，向北面眺望着；并且关切地议论着说：
    “杜叶忠和敖祥云怕赶不回来了！”
    杜叶忠和敖祥云是第四班的司机。杜叶忠的驾驶技术是全连最好的，敖祥云驾驶的汽车是全连最坏的一辆。“竞赛月”开始的时候，在连的动员大会上，各班都响应了共产党支部提出的争取做“优胜班”的号召。杜叶忠代表第四班向成绩最好的第二班提出挑战。竞赛的头五夜过去了，四班和二班的成绩总是相等。今天虽然下了大雪，杜叶忠却下定决心要跑三趟。敖祥云也决定要跑两趟，超过二班的成绩。
    杜叶忠和助手白永流白天就做好了一切准备工作。傍晚，他们就把车子开上了积满冰雪的公路。北风呼呼地吼叫着，杜叶忠怕听不见防空哨的警报枪，就把车门上的玻璃放下来，帽子的遮耳掀上去，不顾刮进来的风雪，盯住眼前路上的车辆往前猛开。两个半钟头以后，他们就赶到了粮站。他们又帮助站上的工作人员装车，很快装满了一车粮食，立刻就回去。这时风雪更大，道路特别滑，来往的车辆也多起来，有的地方敌机又照例地挂上了“天灯”，炸弹不断地在附近爆炸。杜叶忠紧张得像在作战一样，一会儿开得很慢，从一辆辆车子的空隙开过去；一会儿又开得快一点，像箭一样穿过了有照明弹照亮的地方；一会儿探出头来，听听上空敌机的响声；一会儿又盯着地下的弹坑和迎面驶过来的车辆的黑影子；但不管怎样，杜叶忠只有一个主意：不停一秒钟。
    敖祥云也在紧张地战斗着。他驾驶的车子早就超过了车龄，而且已经破旧不堪，驾驶室也塌了半边。车子一动，风雪便迎面扑进来，打在脸上的雪，很快就融化了，风再一吹，他的帽沿、眉毛和衣服的钮扣上都结起了冰霜。紧握着方向盘的两手已经麻木了，只要一动，手套上的薄冰就落下来，衣服也冻得像铁甲一样。车子在路上经常发生故障，先是水箱漏水，后来油斥拉杆也不好使了。他只好开一段修一段，有一次气缸嘴子坏了，他只得在路旁停下来赶修。再说这辆车子也同样要错车，要冲过有照明弹照亮的地方。错车时他就细心地把车停在一边，一面大声叫喊着，以免撞坏汽车；冲过有照明弹照亮的地方时，水不够用又不能停下来，他就用桶装了水，夹在两腿中，一面用皮管输水，一面往前开。许多司机见他的车子坏了，要停下来帮助他修理，他总是说：“我自己修理吧，不要耽误了你们的工作。”
    正当加油站上的人在关切地议论着的时候，杜叶忠第三趟返回来了。接着马达声由远而近，随着一道道刺眼的灯光，一辆辆满载着粮食的汽车急驰过来，敖祥云也赶到了。杜叶忠这夜载运了三万三千二百多斤粮食，敖祥云也超额完成了任务。大家都聚在这两辆汽车的驾驶室旁赞扬说：“你们真是英雄车啊！”
