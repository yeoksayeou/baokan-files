    Suggest Thorough Inspection of Beijing Fire Protection Enterprises

    To the Editor: None of the eight fire equipment factories in Beijing are free from cutting corners and speculation. Last March, the privately-owned Beijing Fire Equipment Factory undertook a large order of fire equipment for a certain department, worth 700 million yuan, reaping a profit of 100%. The most serious problem is that the sheet metal of this batch of equipment was of very poor quality, and the fire extinguishers were not pressurized at all. The privately-owned New China Fire Equipment Factory was even more whimsical, selling an "atomic fire extinguisher" in 1949. This fire extinguisher was completely ineffective, and would not work in a slightly larger room. Each fire extinguisher only cost three to five jin of millet, but was sold for six to seventy jin. The factory hard-sold these door-to-door, selling a total of 60,000 "atomic fire extinguishers," illegally profiting 3.6 million jin of millet. Other private fire equipment factories have engaged in similar behavior. Therefore, I suggest that the Beijing Municipal Thrift and Inspection Committee establish a special team to conduct a thorough inspection of the city's fire protection enterprises and related factories and fire brigades.

    建议彻底检查京市消防企业
    编辑同志：北京市八家消防器材厂，没有一家不偷工减料和投机倒把。去年三月，私营北京消防器材厂承做某部一大批消防器材，价值七亿多元，获暴利百分之百。最严重的是，这批器材的铁皮质量很坏，灭火器全部没有打气。私营新中国消防器材厂更异想天开，在一九四九年出售一种“原子消火器”。这种消火器毫无效力，在稍大一点的房内就不起作用。每个消火器成本只需三、五斤小米，售价却达六、七十斤。该厂挨户硬销，共售出六万个
    “原子消火器”，非法获利达三百六十万斤小米。其他几家私营消防器材厂也有类似行为。为此，我建议北京市节约检查委员会成立专门小组，对本市消防企业及有关工厂、消防队进行彻底检查。
