    Fengfeng Station and Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office Construction Section
    Should Not Treat State Property with Bureaucratic Attitudes
    To the Editor: During the winter of 1951, when our Fengfeng Mining Area was repairing the highway, we unearthed four sections of railway track. All the road repair workers excitedly said, "Let's hand it over to Fengfeng Station; this is also a small contribution to the country." However, when Wang Wenqing, a staff member of the mining area government, telephoned Fengfeng Station to ask them to quickly receive these rails, the people at Fengfeng Station actually replied, "We are under the leadership of the Taiyuan Railway Branch; you should contact them! We don't handle this kind of thing." The workers' boundless enthusiasm was met with a bucket of cold water, so they were all very angry. Some people then told the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office Construction Section, hoping they would pass it on to the Taiyuan Railway Branch. Unexpectedly, Section Chief Chang of the Construction Section had exactly the same argument as that comrade at Fengfeng Station. We believe that their attitude towards state property is wrong, and they should conduct a thorough self-examination. Now these rails are still in their original place, and we request that the relevant departments handle them quickly.

    峰峰车站和邯郸专署建设科
    不该用官僚主义态度对待国家财产
    编辑同志：我们峰峰矿区在一九五一年冬季修理公路时，刨出四根铁轨。全体修路民工兴奋地说：“把它交给峰峰车站吧，这也是对国家的一点贡献。”但是，当矿区政府工作人员王文清用电话要求峰峰车站的人员赶快接收这些铁轨时，峰峰车站的人竟回答说：“我们属太原铁路分局领导，你们到那边去联系吧！我们不管这种事。”工人们的无限热情换到了一盆冷水，因此，都非常气愤。有的人就告诉了邯郸专署建设科，希望他们转告太原铁路分局。不料，建设科常科长的论调，竟和峰峰车站那位同志完全一样。我们认为他们这种对待国家财产的态度是不对的，他们应该进行深入的检查。现在这些铁轨仍放在原地，我们要求有关部门迅速处理。    王平等五人
