    Guangzhou Branch of China Coal Industry Building Materials Company
    Greatly Improves Work Efficiency After the "Three-Anti" Campaign

    The entire staff of the Guangzhou Branch of the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company, after being educated in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, have enhanced their awareness of cherishing state property, and work efficiency has greatly improved. In early March, the company completed the task of receiving more than 1.9 million fir logs scattered across the rivers of Guangdong Province ahead of schedule. In order to rush these logs out before the spring floods, the company's staff in Guangzhou, Qujiang, Lechang, and other places, on the one hand, braved the strong winds and rain day and night to guard the riverbanks, fighting the tides regardless of their lives to protect the timber rafts that stretched for dozens of miles, preventing them from being scattered by the currents; on the other hand, they worked day and night to load and transport the logs. As of March 20, they had basically completed the entire month's transfer task, transporting more than 600,000 fir logs to supply construction needs in the Northwest, North China, and other regions. The company's transport volume at Guangzhou South Station has also greatly increased, recently increasing by 90% compared to before the "Three-Anti" campaign.

    The reason for overfulfilling the transportation task is that the staff not only changed their attitude towards labor during the "Three-Anti" campaign, but also used their brains to improve working methods. For example, at the wharf where the Guangzhou South Station working group operates, the mud is waist-deep when the water recedes, making it impossible to move the timber rafts from the water to the shore. Now, they have built several wooden bridges on the riverbed, extending into the river, so that they can continue to move the logs even after the water recedes. In the past, because the fir logs were of different lengths, there were many gaps left in the railcars during loading. Now, they pre-allocate the fir logs according to size, filling the gaps in the cars. As a result, the capacity of every eight railcars is now equal to that of nine railcars in the past.

    Other departments of the company have also shown new signs of improvement in production. For example, the Coal Industry Division originally had eight staff members. After the "Three-Anti" campaign, only one person was left to maintain operations. Because he was able to study the business diligently and go deep into the market to promote bituminous coal, the division still completed 95.5% of its bituminous coal sales plan in February, even with the "tiger-beating" sessions that stopped work in the afternoons. The sales plan for March was basically completed by March 20.

    Currently, the amount of money earned per person in the company (averaged across all original staff) is the highest among enterprises in the Central South region. As of March 20, the amount of money earned per person had reached 92 million yuan. The guaranteed number per person by the end of the month is 130 million yuan, while the average for the entire last year was only 91 million yuan. When the company increased its transport volume last year, everyone said the task was too heavy; now, they have voluntarily proposed a monthly transport volume that is 70% higher than last year (the higher authorities reduced it by half). In the first twenty days of March, they have already overfulfilled the entire month's transport volume.

    Based on the new ideological style of the staff, the company recently revised two plans. One is to increase the planned sales and transfers of goods for this year by 40%; the other is to increase the figure for increased production and savings this year from 2.5 billion yuan to 4.5 billion yuan. When the plan for increased production and savings was formulated at the end of last year, everyone was not very confident. Now, they say: "Increasing production and saving 4.5 billion yuan is actually a minimum figure!" (Xinhua News Agency)

### 中国煤业建筑器材公司广州分公司  经过“三反”运动后工作效率大大提高

    中国煤业建筑器材公司广州分公司
    经过“三反”运动后工作效率大大提高
    中国煤业建筑器材公司广州分公司全体工作人员，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中受到教育，增强了爱护国家财产的观念，工作效率大大提高。三月初，该公司提前完成了接收一批散布在广东省各江河面的一百九十多万根杉木的任务。为了要在春汛前将这批杉木抢运出去，该公司在广州、曲江、乐昌等地的工作人员，一面日夜冒着疾风暴雨在江边守望，不顾生命地和浪潮搏斗，保护着数十里长的木排，使它们不被水流冲散；一面日夜奔忙，装载抢运。到三月二十日止，他们已基本上完成了三月份全月的调运任务，计运出六十多万根杉木，供应西北、华北等地建设需要。该公司在广州南站的运输量也大大增加，最近几天已比“三反”运动前提高了百分之九十。
    超额完成运输任务的原因，是工作人员在“三反”运动中不但改变了劳动态度，而且还开动脑筋来改善工作方法，例如广州南站工作组工作的码头，水退时泥深及腰，过去无法把水里的木排搬到岸上，现在他们就在河床上架了几道木桥，伸到江中，水退后也可以照常搬运。过去因杉木长短不一，装载时车皮留出的空隙很多，现在他们按尺寸把杉木预先调配好，填满车上的空隙，结果，每八个车皮的容量便等于过去的九个车皮。
    该公司的其他部门也同样出现了改进生产的新气象。如煤业股原来有八个工作人员，“三反”运动后，只留下一个人维持工作，由于他能钻研业务，深入市场去推销烟煤，二月份在下午停止办公进行打“虎”的情况下，该股推销烟煤的计划还是完成了百分之九十五点五，三月份的推销计划，到三月二十日已基本完成。
    现在该公司每个人的卖钱额（按原有全部人员平均）是中南区各企业单位中最高的。三月份到二十日为止，每个人的卖钱额已达九千二百万元，到月终每个人的必成数是一亿三千万元，而去年全年平均只有九千一百万元。当去年该公司增加调出运输量的时候，大家都说任务太重；现在他们自动提出的每月运输量比去年提高了百分之七十（上级核减一半）。在三月份的二十天里，他们已超额完成全月运输量。
    在工作人员新的思想作风的基础上，该公司最近修订了两个计划。一个是把今年销售和调出的货物计划增加了百分之四十；另一个是把今年增产节约的数字由二十五亿元增加到四十五亿元。当去年底制订增产节约计划时，大家都信心不高，现在，他们说：“增产节约四十五亿元，实在是个最低限度的数目！”    （新华社）
