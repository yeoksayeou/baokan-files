Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 29th: Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, hosted a banquet at 8:00 PM on the 27th to entertain all members of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Delegation. Gao Chongmin, Chairman of the Northeast Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, as well as Ning Wu, Che Xiangchen, Guan Mengjue, Wang Bin (Director of the Northeast People's Government Health Department), Bai Xiqing (Deputy Director), and Jiao Ruoyu (Deputy Mayor of Shenyang) were invited to attend.

After the banquet, a symposium was held. Brandweiner, head of the delegation, and Cavaglieri, deputy head, expressed their deep gratitude to the people of Northeast China for their strong assistance in the delegation's investigation, which allowed them to complete their mission successfully. Brandweiner summarized the delegation's visits to many witnesses and inspections of various pieces of evidence, saying, "In my opinion, a large amount of material has proven the fact that the United States used airplanes to spread a large number of germ-carrying insects in the Northeast region of China. We will submit a report to the International Association of Democratic Lawyers."

British representative Gastel, Polish representative Wasilkowska, Belgian representative Morrens, Brazilian representative De Britto, and French representative Jascale successively spoke, unanimously condemning the heinous act of aggression by the US imperialists in carrying out germ warfare in the Northeast region of China, which violates international law and human justice.

British representative Gastel said: "The facts are very clear. Did the United States use germ bombs as weapons? How did the insects fall? Were the insects cultivated artificially? How were they brought to Chinese soil? These have already come to affirmative conclusions: It was definitely not an accidental event, nor was it naturally occurring, nor was it placed on the ground. Doctors have proven that various deadly germs are clearly seen on these insects. At the same time, according to the evidence, American planes were discovered a very short time before these insects were found in these areas. Therefore, the fact is established and should be announced to the world."

Polish representative Wasilkowska said: "I was deeply impressed by seeing the United States use germ warfare to kill the Chinese people in China. The materials show that the United States has long been preparing to use germ weapons in combat. But more importantly, this kind of germ warfare by the United States is not aimed at military targets, but at eliminating all mankind. This is the case in Korea, and it is also the case in China. This crime is a military crime, and also a crime against all mankind, a crime of eliminating all mankind, and a crime of aggression. The US germ warfare not only threatens the Chinese people and the Asian people, but also threatens all mankind; therefore, it should arouse the anger and hatred of all mankind. This heinous crime of US imperialism will promote the great unity of the world's people. Even if some people still doubt whether the US policy is aggressive, when they see that the US policy is to eliminate all mankind, they will definitely rise up to oppose and eliminate aggressive war. I believe that progressive people and progressive jurists will see this situation and work harder to expose the crimes of US imperialism and fight resolutely against the evil germ warfare."

Belgian representative Morrens said: "I think the facts have been established: Many witnesses saw objects dropped from the air, after which insects were discovered, and various evidence is consistent. We also heard reports from many entomologists and bacteriologists, many of whom are world-renowned. They proved that the insects carried bacteria. More importantly, we have obtained proof that the things were dropped from airplanes, American airplanes. These facts all prove that the United States is conducting germ warfare. I am sure that when our investigation report is made, it will cause widespread anger in our country."

Brazilian representative De Britto said: "Many factors convinced me that the claim that the United States had long prepared for germ warfare is correct. We heard reports from many experts. In the past, we rarely had so many experts testifying during our inquiries. What these experts said is true. After I return to my country, I will convey the facts they said to the people of our country. At the same time, I also want to say that these strange insects found here can be found in our South American Brazil. These mosquitoes, flies, and spiders also carry bacteria. Therefore, I am sure that these insects were artificially cultivated to carry bacteria. Moreover, the climate below zero degrees is the best time to preserve bacteria and wait for them to reproduce. The formal and serious testimony of the air defense commander convinced me that the planes were indeed American. The conclusions drawn from these facts constitute the crime of the aggressive act of the United States of America against the People's Republic of China."

French representative Jascale said: "After studying the reports and evidence from government authorities, witnesses, and experts, I believe that the bacteria were dropped by American planes after they passed; it is impossible to explain that the US government did not conduct germ warfare. After I bring the true facts back to my country, I will definitely be able to arouse the research of capable bacteriologists and entomologists in our country. The results of these studies will make them even more convinced of these facts. In addition, in Korea, we know that the United States has already used means of warfare prohibited by international law; therefore, it is not too surprising that they used germ warfare in the Northeast region of China. During our investigation, bringing back the accurate information about the US conducting germ warfare will be very helpful for defending world peace."

After the representatives of various countries spoke, Brandweiner, head of the delegation, spoke again. He said: "As an international law professor, I say that germ warfare is explicitly prohibited in international law. Therefore, the use of bacteria itself constitutes a war crime; using this method against ordinary civilians is a crime against humanity. Bacterial weapons are also a kind of war weapon. Using military weapons against a country is committing the crime of aggression."

Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, spoke last. He expressed his gratitude for the delegation's hard work. He emphasized that since US imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, it has repeatedly used military aircraft to intrude into our country's Northeast airspace to carry out bombing and strafing, killing and wounding our country's peaceful people and destroying our Northeast's construction endeavors. These are all facts. Since the end of February this year until now, the actions of the US aggressors have become even more despicable. They have even used military aircraft to spread germ-carrying insects in the Northeast region of our country. At the end of February, when the Northeast was still covered in ice and snow, germ-carrying insects spread by US military aircraft were discovered in many places. The delegation has collected many materials from many witnesses and pieces of evidence regarding these facts. As everyone has just said, the Chinese people have a deep understanding of the aggressive acts of US imperialism. Since the planes of US imperialism spread germ-carrying poisonous insects in the Northeast, our people's hatred for US imperialism has deepened even more. They have a greater understanding of the vulgarity and despicableness of US imperialism. After seeing the poisonous insects dropped by American planes, tens of thousands of people turned out to wipe them out cleanly and thoroughly. People said, "Killing a poisonous insect is equivalent to eliminating an American devil!" Therefore, it is difficult for the crime of US imperialism in spreading germ-carrying poisonous insects to achieve the effect it hopes for. Now, the broad masses of people in the Northeast region of China have formed a people's mass epidemic prevention front against germ warfare. However, the heinous US imperialists still want to continue their crime of spreading germ-carrying poisonous insects. This crime is not only a threat to the Chinese people, but also a threat to all mankind. The people of the Northeast hope that the delegation's accurate conclusions will be announced to the people of the world soon. This is not only for the Korean people and the Chinese people, but also for the just cause that is beneficial to the people of the world.

    国际民主法律工作者协会调查团全体团员在东北谈话会上
    一致斥责美国扩大细菌战的罪行
    东北人民政府副主席林枫曾设宴招待全体团员
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】东北人民政府副主席林枫二十七日午后八时设宴招待国际民主法律工作者协会调查团全体团员。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会东北总分会主席高崇民、在沈阳的各民主党派代表宁武、车向忱、关梦觉、东北人民政府卫生部部长王斌、副部长白希清、沈阳市副市长焦若愚等应邀作陪。
    宴会后，举行谈话会。调查团团长布兰德魏纳、副团长卡瓦莱里对东北人民大力协助该团进行调查工作，圆满完成任务，深深表示感谢。布兰德魏纳综述该团访问许多证人、考察各项证物的情形后说，在我看来，大量的材料都已证明了美国用飞机在中国东北地区撒布大量带细菌昆虫的事实。我们将向国际民主法律工作者协会提出报告。
    英国代表加斯特尔、波兰代表华西尔考夫斯卡、比利时代表莫伦斯、巴西代表狄布里托、法国代表贾斯盖相继发言，一致斥责美帝国主义者在中国东北地区进行万恶的、破坏国际公法、违犯人类正义的细菌战的侵略行为。
    英国代表加斯特尔说：事实是很明显的，美国是否使用了细菌弹武器？昆虫是怎样掉下来的？昆虫是否用人工的方法培养出来？怎样带到中国的土地上？这些都已经有了肯定的结论：绝对不是偶然发生的事件，也不是自然发生的，也不是放置在地上的。医生证明：从这些昆虫的身上很清楚地看到了带有各种致命的病菌。同时，根据证明，在这些地区发现虫类以前的很短时间内发现了美国飞机。因此，事实是成立的，也是应该向全世界宣布的。
    波兰代表华西尔考夫斯卡说：我在中国看到了美国用细菌战的方法杀害中国人民，得到了深刻的印象。从材料中看出，美国早已长期准备着使用细菌武器作战。但更重要的是，美国的这种细菌战，并不是针对着军事目标，而是在于消灭全人类。在朝鲜是这样，在中国也是如此。这一罪行是军事上的犯罪，也是反对全人类、消灭全人类的罪行、侵略的罪行。美国进行细菌战，不仅威胁着中国人民和
    亚洲人民，而且威胁着整个人类；因此，应该引起
    全人类的愤怒和仇恨。美帝国主义这种滔天罪行，将促成世界人类的大团结。即使有些人还怀疑美国的政策是否具有侵略性；但当他们看到美国的政策是要消灭全人类时，他们也一定会起来反对，消灭侵略战争。我相信：进步的人民、进步的法律学家看到了这种情况以后，会更加努力地揭发美帝国主义的罪行，与罪恶的细菌战作坚决斗争。
    比利时代表莫伦斯说：我认为事实已经成立：有许多证人看到空中有东西投下后就有昆虫发现，各种证据都是符合的。我们还听到许多昆虫学专家、细菌学专家的报告，他们之中许多人都是世界闻名的，他们证明昆虫是带有细菌的。更重要的是，我们得到了证明，东西是由飞机上投下的，是美国的飞机。这些事实，都证明了美国是在进行细菌战。我确信：当我们的调查报告作出后，在我们国内将引起广泛的愤怒。
    巴西代表狄布里托说：有许多因素使我确信，美国早已准备细菌战的说法是正确的。我们听到了很多专家的报告，过去我们在询问中很少有这许多的专家作证。这些专家所说的都是真实的，我回国以后，要将他们所说的事实传达给我国人民。同时，我还要说，在这里所发现的这些奇怪昆虫，在我们南美巴西是能够找得到的。这些蚊子、苍蝇、蜘蛛又带有细菌。因此，我确信：这些昆虫是用人工培养使其带菌的。而且，在温度零度以下的气候，正是保存细菌等待繁殖的最好时机。防空司令的正式的、严肃的作证，使我确信：飞机的确是美国的。这些事实得出的结论，构成了美利坚合众国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的犯罪。
    法国代表贾斯盖说：研究了政府当局、证人、专家的报告和各项证据以后，我相信，细菌是美国飞机经过以后所投下的；无法解释美国政府没有进行细菌战。我把确实的事实带回我国后，一定能引起我国有能力的细菌学家、昆虫学家的研究。这些研究的结果，会使他们更加确信这些事实。此外，在朝鲜，我们知道美国已经使用了为国际公法所禁止的战争手段；因此，它们在中国东北地区使用细菌作战，并不使人觉得太奇怪。我们在调查中，能把美国进行细菌战的确实情报带回去，对于保卫世界和平是很有帮助的。
    在各国代表发言后，调查团团长布兰德魏纳再度发言。他说：我以一个国际法教授的身份来说，细菌战在国际公法中是明文禁止的。所以使用细菌的本身，就构成了战争的犯罪；用这个方法对付普遍平民，就是对人类的犯罪行为。细菌武器也是战争武器的一种，用军事武器对付一个国家，就是犯了侵略的罪行。
    东北人民政府副主席林枫最后发言。他对调查团的辛劳工作表示感谢。他强调指出，自从美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争后，已经无数次地使用军用飞机侵入我国东北领空，进行轰炸、扫射，炸死炸伤我国的和平人民，破坏我东北的建设事业，这些都是事实。自从今年二月末以来，直到现在，美国侵略者的行为更加卑鄙，竟然使用军用飞机到我国东北地区撒布含菌昆虫。在二月底，东北还是冰天雪地的时候，许多地方都发现了美国军用飞机撒布的含菌昆虫。这些事实，调查团已从许多人证、物证中，搜集了许多材料。这也是事实，正如刚才大家所说的，中国人民对于美帝国主义的侵略行为已有深刻的认识。自从美帝国主义的飞机在东北撒布含菌毒虫以后，我国人民对美帝国主义的仇恨已更加加深了，他们更加认识了美帝国主义的下流、卑鄙。人们看到美国飞机撒下的毒虫后，成千上万的人一齐出动，把它干净、彻底地扑灭。人们说：“打死一个毒虫，就等于消灭一个美国鬼子！”因此，美帝国主义撒布含菌毒虫的罪行，是难以收到它所希望的效果的。现在，中国东北地区广大人民已经结成了反细菌战的、人民群众的防疫战线。但是，万恶的美帝国主义者，还是要继续其撒布含菌毒虫的罪行。这种罪行，不仅是对中国人民的威胁，也是对全人类的威胁。东北人民很希望调查团的确实结论很快地在全世界人民的面前公布。这不仅仅是为了朝鲜人民，为了中国人民，而是为了对世界人民有利的正义事业。
