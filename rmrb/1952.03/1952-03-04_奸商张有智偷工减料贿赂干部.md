    Profiteer Zhang Youzhi Skimps on Materials and Bribes Cadres
    Editor: Zhang Youzhi, the manager of the private Yuheng Yuan Construction Factory in Beijing, is a big profiteer who steals state property. He bribes cadres with money and goods, and even lures cadres to prostitutes. In one unit of a certain department of the North China Military Region alone, seven cadres accepted his bribes. When Zhang Youzhi contracted to build more than 2.7 billion yuan worth of construction projects for certain units of the North China Military Region, he used despicable methods such as skimping on materials and substituting inferior goods for good ones, causing the state to lose more than 470 million yuan. In the construction of 25 classrooms for a certain unit, the walls have subsided and begun to crack due to the insecure foundations; the ceilings and cement floors have all cracked; the cement floors of five classrooms have subsided half an inch in their entirety; and the building has also sunk. In the construction of 21 houses for another unit, the doors and windows are now all warped and cracked, and cannot be closed; all the indoor drains are unusable. I demand that the government severely punish the profiteer Zhang Youzhi and demand that he compensate for the losses.

    奸商张有智偷工减料贿赂干部
    编辑同志：北京私营玉恒源营造厂经理张有智是一个盗窃国家财产的大奸商。他以金钱财物贿赂干部，甚至勾引干部去玩妓女。只华北军区某部一个单位，就有七个干部受了他的贿赂。张有智承包华北军区某些单位二十七亿多元的修建工程时，用偷工减料、以坏顶好的卑鄙手段，使国家损失了四亿七千多万元。某单位的二十五间教室工程，因地基打得不实，墙壁已下沉，并开始裂缝；顶棚和洋灰地都崩裂了；有五间教室的洋灰地整块下沉了半英寸；房子也已下陷。另一单位的二十一间房屋工程，门窗现已全部翘裂，没法关拢；全部室内水沟不能使用。我要求政府严惩奸商张有智，并要他赔偿损失。
