    In the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign
    Northwest Refinery Corrects Neglect of Business Operations
    Tianjin No. 5 State-Owned Cotton Mill Simultaneously Attacks Corrupt Elements and Strives for Production
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency reports: A certain oil mine refinery in the Northwest, in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, corrected the tendency of not valuing production, and production is proceeding normally.
    In early January, after the mine launched the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the refinery's leading cadres and many workers adopted a merely "maintaining" attitude towards production. As a result, they were negligent in implementing safety regulations and observing labor discipline. In January alone, there were nineteen major and minor technical responsibility accidents. For example, the crude oil flow controller in the cracking plant malfunctioned, but the plant director did not discover it until eight days later. The production task for the main products in January was only 87.31 percent completed.
    After the above situation occurred, it aroused the attention of the refinery's leadership. In order to win victories on both the anti-corruption and production fronts, the administrative side of the refinery made careful and detailed adjustments between and within each production department. Small mobilization meetings concerning the anti-corruption struggle were held through cadre communication; large mobilization meetings were held through radio listening; those who could not listen to the radio used production gaps to convene expanded meetings of the trade union小组 (xiǎozǔ). In mid-February, the Mining Bureau convened an enlarged meeting of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Inspection Committee. Leading cadres explained that all employees must complete their production tasks according to plan in the anti-corruption struggle. If production is neglected, then the victory against corruption is not a complete victory. After the meeting, the factory workshops and小组 (xiǎozǔ) of the refinery discussed how to guarantee production, and combined with the accidents and lax phenomena that occurred in the factory's production, carried out self-criticism and criticism. Many小组 (xiǎozǔ) challenged each other, saying:
    "Anti-corruption is for the sake of doing a good job in production and building the motherland. On the one hand, we must bravely and seriously catch tigers, and on the other hand, we must have the confidence and determination to complete the production tasks." After these discussions, self-criticism and challenges, everyone's mood was very high. In their work, grassroots trade union cadres constantly encouraged everyone to work hard with the victories on the anti-corruption and production fronts. As of February 22, the attendance rate of the refinery's employees had increased from 95.5 percent last month to 99.8 percent. Gasoline production had already completed 85.1 percent of the monthly production plan, kerosene completed 82.1 percent, and lubricating oil completed 86 percent.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The entire staff and workers of Tianjin No. 5 State-Owned Cotton Mill are concentrating their efforts on encircling and suppressing corrupt elements while striving for production in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign. Currently, both the anti-corruption struggle and production at the factory have achieved great results. In the anti-corruption struggle, many major corrupt criminals have been captured, exceeding the original combat plan. They are now fiercely expanding their gains. In terms of production, the production plans for January and February have also been overfulfilled. In the first half of February, cotton yarn production exceeded the plan by seven pieces, and cotton cloth exceeded the plan by 210 bolts. The portion exceeding the plan in February doubled compared to January.
    In order to repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks without delaying production, the factory, under the leadership of the Party's general branch committee, organized a strong anti-corruption struggle command headquarters headed by the general branch secretary and deputy factory director. Representatives were elected from each workshop to form a 350-person combat force. At the same time, a temporary production command organization headed by the factory director and engineers was formed to specifically lead production work. Appropriate adjustments were also made to the organization of each workshop. Under the leadership of the Party's general branch committee, propagandists vigorously publicized the significance of launching the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, as well as the close relationship between this struggle and the increase production and practice economy movement. They proposed: "Concentrate efforts on production in the workshop to ensure overfulfillment of tasks; fiercely pursue corrupt criminals in the workshop, resolutely wiping them out in one fell swoop." The workers responsible for the anti-corruption task and those responsible for the production task made mutual guarantees to concentrate efforts on anti-corruption and actively engage in production. After analyzing the enemy's situation and selecting the key points, the anti-corruption command quickly cracked the major corruption case of the warehouse department and the opening and cleaning workshop colluding with unscrupulous merchants to collectively steal 130,000 catties of raw cotton. The victory of the anti-corruption struggle greatly encouraged the workers at their production posts. They reported their achievements to each other and encouraged each other to continue their efforts. The three-shift production indication charts established in the past were not abandoned in this struggle. Workers more actively inspected them at any time and competed with each other more than in the past. Although some of the backbone workers in the workshop were drawn to participate in the anti-corruption struggle, the workers who remained worked hard, actively studied technology, and production efficiency continued to improve.
    The factory's administrative leaders and technical personnel received profound education in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, and bureaucratic work styles have been significantly overcome. Technical cadres go deep into the workshops every day, and many problems that occur in production are solved in a timely manner. In this way, the production of the Fifth Cotton Textile Factory has been maintained normally and has developed in the anti-corruption struggle.
    The anti-corruption struggle has also created some difficulties for production. For example, the cadres of the warehouse department are all major corrupt criminals, and the supply of raw cotton is directly affected. The factory leadership quickly transferred three cadres to act as agents. Another example is that several administrators in the opening and cleaning workshop are corrupt elements. After they were discovered, the workshop director directly contacted the group leaders, and everyone guaranteed that problems would be studied and solved in a timely manner. In this way, not only did the lack of administrators not affect production, but workshop management became even more in-depth than before.

    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中
    西北某炼油厂纠正忽视业务工作
    国营天津第五棉纺织厂一面围攻贪污分子一面努力生产
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西北某油矿炼油厂，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中纠正了不重视生产的偏向，生产正常进行。
    一月初旬，该矿展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后，炼油厂领导干部和许多职工对生产采取仅仅“维持”的态度，因此在执行安全制度、遵守劳动纪律方面都疏忽了，在一月内就发生大小技术责任事故十九件。如裂炼厂原油流量管制器发生毛病，八天之后才为厂主任发觉。一月份主要产品的生产任务，仅完成百分之八十七点三一。
    以上情况发生后，引起了该厂领导方面的重视，为了在反贪污和生产两条战线上都获得胜利，该厂行政方面在各生产部门之间和部门内部都作了慎重细致的调整。有关反贪污斗争的小的动员会，采取干部传达方式举行；大的动员会采取广播收听方式举行，收听不到的利用生产空隙召开工会小组扩大会进行传达。二月中旬，矿务局召开增产节约检查委员会扩大会议，领导干部说明全体职工在反贪污斗争中，必须按计划完成生产任务。如果忽视了生产，那么反贪污的胜利，也不是完满的胜利。会后炼油厂所属各厂车间小组，都讨论如何保证生产，并结合本厂在生产中发生的事故和松弛现象，进行了检讨和批评。许多小组并相互挑战说：
    “反贪污就是为了搞好生产，建设祖国。我们一方面勇敢认真地捕捉老虎，一方面要有信心和决心来完成生产任务。”经过这些讨论、检讨和挑战后，大家情绪很高。在工作中，工会基层组织干部并随时以反贪污战线和生产战线上的胜利来鼓舞大家努力工作。到二月二十二日为止，炼油厂职工的出勤率已由上月的百分之九十五点五提高到百分之九十九点八。汽油产量已经完成全月生产计划的百分之八十五点一，煤油完成百分之八十二点一，机油完成百分之八十六。
    【本报讯】国营天津第五棉纺织厂全体职工，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，一面集中力量围攻贪污分子，一面努力生产。现在该厂的反贪污斗争和生产都得到很大成绩。在反贪污斗争中，已捕获了不少大贪污犯，超过了原来的作战计划，现正猛烈扩大战果。在生产方面，一、二月份的生产计划也都超额完成。二月份上半月棉纱产量超过计划七件，棉布超过计划二百一十匹。二月份超过计划部分较一月份增加了一倍。
    该厂为作到打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，又不耽误生产，便在党的总支委员会领导下，以总支书记、副厂长为首，组织了坚强的反贪污斗争的指挥部，并由各车间推选代表，组成一支包括三百五十人的战斗部队；同时，以厂长和工程师为首，组成了临时的生产指挥机构，专门负责领导生产工作，对各车间的组织，也进行了适当的调整。在党的总支委员会领导下，宣传员大力宣传了开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的意义，以及这一斗争和增产节约运动的密切关系，提出：“在车间集中精力搞生产，保证超过任务；下车间猛烈追击贪污犯，坚决一网打尽。”担负反贪污任务和担负生产任务的职工，都互相提出了集中力量反贪污和积极生产的保证。反贪污指挥部分析了敌情，选择了重点以后，便迅速地攻破了栈务科、清花间勾结奸商集体盗窃原棉十三万斤的大贪污案。反贪污斗争的胜利，大大地鼓舞了生产岗位上的职工。他们互相报告成绩，互相勉励继续努力。过去建立的三班生产指示图表，在这次斗争不但未废弛，工人们比过去更积极地随时进行检查并互相比赛。车间内的骨干工人虽然抽出了一些去参加反贪污斗争，但是留下的工人努力生产，积极钻研技术，生产效率仍然不断提高。
    厂的行政领导干部和技术人员，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中受到了深刻的教育，官僚主义作风已有了显著克服。技术干部每天深入车间，生产中发生的许多问题，都及时地得到解决。这样，第五棉纺织厂的生产，在反贪污斗争中保持正常，并且有了发展。
    反贪污斗争也曾给生产造成了某些困难，如栈务科的干部都是大贪污犯，原棉供应工作就直接受到影响。工厂领导方面迅速调了三个干部去代理工作。又如清花间里有好几个管理员都是贪污分子，发现以后车间主任就直接与组长联系，大家保证有问题及时研究及时解决。这样，不但没有因缺少管理员而影响生产，车间管理反而较以前更为深入了。    （刘再生）
