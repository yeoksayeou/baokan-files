Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 3rd:

    To purify the Party ranks and enforce strict Party discipline, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of Party member cadres on February 29th to announce its decision to discipline eight Communist Party members. Among the eight disciplined Communist Party members, four were removed from their posts for obstructing the development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, and four were of poor quality and had lost the qualifications to be Communist Party members, and were expelled from the Party. Liu Changsheng, Third Secretary of the Municipal Committee, explained the importance of purifying the Party ranks and enforcing strict Party discipline at the meeting, and then announced the Municipal Committee's decision: (1) Li Yu, member of the Municipal Committee and Secretary-General of the Municipal Committee, had committed serious errors in the past, and despite repeated education and assistance, had not improved. In his work in Shanghai for more than two years, he continued to maintain his consistent patriarchal style and serious bureaucracy, abused his power, and acted arbitrarily, obstructing the normal leadership of the Municipal Committee. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, he also lacked serious and conscientious self-criticism. It was decided to remove him from his post and order him to deeply reflect on his errors. As for his concurrent positions as member of the East China Military and Political Committee, member of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Municipal Construction Committee, it is recommended that relevant departments remove them as well. (2) Gu Zhun, member of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Municipal Committee, has consistently exhibited serious individual heroism, self-righteousness, lack of regard for organization, and violation of the Party's policies and guidelines. Despite repeated education, he has shown no improvement. It was decided to remove him from his post and order him to deeply reflect on his errors. As for his positions as Deputy Minister of the Finance Department of the East China Military and Political Committee, Deputy Director of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Director of the Finance Bureau, and Director of the Tax Bureau, it is recommended that relevant departments remove them as well. (3) Wang Jihua, one of the members of the Party group of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, has consistently exhibited a strong bourgeois ideology and style, violated the financial and economic laws and decrees of the People's Government, and failed to thoroughly confess to the Party. It was decided to remove him from his post and order him to deeply reflect on his errors. As for his position as Deputy Secretary-General of the Finance and Economics Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, it is recommended that relevant departments remove him as well. (4) Chen Gongqi, member of the Party group of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, has consistently displayed extremely serious patriarchal and bureaucratic styles in his work. His errors in implementing the cadre policy have caused disunity among the cadres of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. He did not seriously examine himself in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, which affected the development of the campaign and aroused extreme dissatisfaction among the workers. It was decided to remove him from his post and order him to deeply reflect on his errors. As for his position as Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, it is recommended that relevant departments remove him as well. (5) Cao Manzhi, Party cadre of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, is of extremely bad character and has committed serious errors in the past, which have not changed to this day. His consistent serious bureaucracy and bad patriarchal style have caused significant losses to the work. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, despite repeated urging from higher authorities, he still failed to seriously examine himself. He is full of the atmosphere of the decadent bourgeoisie and even feudal landlords, and his degeneration and deterioration are beyond salvation, completely losing the qualifications to be a Communist Party member. It was decided to immediately expel him from the Party. It is also recommended that relevant departments remove him from his positions as Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau. (6) Cheng Wanli, member of the Shanghai Electric Power Company Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, is of extremely bad character and has committed serious errors, which he has not repented to this day. During his tenure at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, he colluded with relatives and instigated corruption. He led a corrupt life and, after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, shielded and covered up embezzlers and thieves, and deceived the organization. The broad masses of workers at the Shanghai Electric Power Company are very dissatisfied with him. Cheng Wanli's degeneration and deterioration are beyond salvation, and it was decided to immediately expel him from the Party. His positions as Director of the Electric Power Management Department of the Public Utilities Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and Military Control Commissioner of the Shanghai Electric Power Company have already been removed by relevant departments; however, it is still necessary to recommend that relevant departments give him the necessary criminal punishment. (7) Ma Naisong, member of the Shanghai Dockworkers' Union Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, is of extremely bad character and has consistently failed to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, violating laws and regulations. While serving as the Director of the Criminal Police Division of the Public Security Bureau of the Municipal People's Government, he even associated with counter-revolutionaries. He also consistently appointed his own people and embezzled public funds, and is suspected of major corruption. In addition to being removed from his administrative position and arrested, it was decided to immediately expel him from the Party. His position as Manager of the Shanghai Dockworkers' Company has already been removed by relevant departments, and it is recommended that he be given the deserved criminal punishment. (8) Du Weiran, former Director of the Reform Through Labor Department of the Public Security Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, is of extremely bad character and has consistently violated laws and regulations and has a bad style. Therefore, in addition to being removed from his position and arrested, it was decided to immediately expel him from the Party, and it is recommended that relevant departments give him the deserved criminal punishment.
    After Liu Changsheng announced the above decisions, Tan Zhenlin, on behalf of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, announced the approval of the Municipal Committee's decision. Tan Zhenlin said: In order to purify the Party ranks and enforce strict Party discipline, the Municipal Committee's approach is completely necessary and correct. He severely criticized the four degenerate elements who were removed from their posts for reflection and the four bad elements who were expelled from the Party, as well as those who committed the same mistakes, and urged them to thoroughly transform themselves in the great anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle.
