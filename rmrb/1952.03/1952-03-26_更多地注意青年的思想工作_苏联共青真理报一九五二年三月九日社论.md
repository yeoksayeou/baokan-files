Pay More Attention to the Ideological Work of Young People
—Editorial of the Soviet Komsomol Truth, March 9, 1952

The Bolshevik Party is very concerned with educating young people with Soviet ideology. The Party of Lenin and Stalin educates our younger generation with the greatest loyalty to the Soviet system and the socialist state. The Party hopes that our young men and women are thoughtful, conscious, and highly cultured people, hoping that they are politically active, strong-willed, brave, able to overcome difficulties heroically, and selflessly work for the motherland.

The vivid example of the Party's paternal, Stalinist concern for the education of young people is the series of resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues. The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state spare no effort or money in educating young people. In our country, all conditions have been created for beneficial Marxist-Leninist study.

Studying revolutionary theory and the works of Lenin and Stalin has become an urgent need for our young people. More than four million people are now studying in the political groups and political schools of the Communist Youth League. About one million young men and women are studying in the Party's education system. Hundreds of thousands of Komsomol members are independently studying Marxist-Leninist theory.

However, there are still many shortcomings in the political education of young people. In many Komsomol organizations in the Kaluga and Kalinin provinces, in the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and in some other places, the ideological level of political study is often low, and the interpretation of Marxist-Leninist theoretical issues is superficial. Leaders of political groups often only require listeners to memorize individual definitions and remember dates and numbers. Obviously, this method of book worship and rote memorization will not be of much benefit. The leadership of political education for young people is not good everywhere. The courses of some groups and political schools lag behind the planned teaching materials. There is no organized supervision of activists who study independently, and the work of regular classroom discussions is not well arranged.

The end of the school year is not far away, and Komsomol organizations should pay attention to completing their studies successfully and in an organized manner.

Special attention should be paid to improving the ideological level of political study. Every lesson, every lecture, or discussion in political groups and schools should be politically purposeful and ideologically profound. In political study, it is necessary to emphasize the outstanding achievements of the Soviet people, the growth of the power of the Soviet state, and the Party's great concern for the education of young people.

Our lectures, discussions, and reports should educate Soviet youth with a high sense of patriotism, love for their motherland, and hatred for enemies. The bestial essence of American imperialism should be explained frequently, its aggressive policy exposed, and young people should be cultivated to hate the enemies of the socialist motherland.

The ideological education of young people should not be limited to political education. Komsomol organizations should make the widest possible use of all means and methods that ideologically influence young people.

The Komsomol congresses and representative conferences held in many republics and provinces have shown the great progress of Soviet youth in the spiritual aspect and their desire for knowledge and high culture. The delegates to the congresses and representative conferences rightly demanded that the Komsomol leading organs pay more attention to the important issue of in-depth research on ideological work. At the Komsomol congress in Uzbekistan, it was pointed out that the rude bourgeois nationalist distortions of science, literature, and art had damaged the education of young people, but the Central Committee of the Uzbek Komsomol had not paid attention to ideological work in the past. At the Komsomol congress in Kyrgyzstan, it was pointed out that the Central Committee of the Komsomol of the Republic did not pay attention to the activities of young scientists of the Republic and did not help them to formulate teaching materials exposing the remnants of feudal clans and nationalism.

Komsomol organizations must always delve into the activities of various cultural institutions—schools, clubs, universities, theaters, museums—and constantly care about the ideological education of creative young people—young scientists, writers, actors, and painters—and help them in their creation.

One of the most important tasks of Komsomol organizations is to strive to strengthen ideological work, to make the solution of ideological work subordinate to the tasks of communist construction, to educate young people with a communist attitude towards labor, and to resolutely fight against phenomena that undermine labor discipline and the perfunctory attitude of individual staff members towards the cause.

All our ideological work among young people should be to educate the new generation of Soviet people into people with profound ideas and loyal to the cause of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and to educate them into builders of communism.

    更多地注意青年的思想工作
    ——苏联共青真理报一九五二年三月九日社论
    布尔什维克党非常关怀以苏维埃思想来教育青年。列宁—斯大林的党以对苏维埃制度和社会主义国家最大的忠诚精神，来教育我国的青年一代。党希望我国的青年男女是有思想的、有觉悟的和具有高度文化的人，希望他们是政治上积极的、坚强不屈的、勇敢的、能英勇地克服困难并忘我地为祖国而劳动的人们。
    党对于青年教育的慈父般的、斯大林的关怀的鲜明范例，便是联共（布）中央关于思想问题的几项决议。布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家对于教育青年是不吝惜力量和金钱的。在我国，为了有益的马克思列宁主义学习，创造了一切条件。
    研究革命理论和列宁斯大林的著作，已经成为我国青年的迫切需要。在共产主义青年团的政治小组和政治学校中，现在有四百多万人在学习。在党的教育系统中学习的，大约有一百万男女青年。独立学习马克思列宁主义理论的有数十万共青团员。
    然而在青年的政治教育工作中，还有许多缺点。在卡路什省和加里宁省、在巴什基尔自治共和国的许多共青团组织和某些其他地方的共青团组织中，政治学习的思想水平时常是低的，对马克思列宁主义理论问题的解释是浮浅的。政治小组的领导者时常只要求听讲者背熟个别的定义，记住日期和数字。显然，这种读死书和死记的方法，是不会有什么益处的。对于青年的政治教育的领导，并不是各地都很好。有一部分小组和政治学校的课程落后于计划的教材。对于自学的积极分子没有组织监督，常设的课堂讨论的工作安排得也不好。
    距学年结束的时间已经不远了，共青团组织应该注意成功地、有组织地来完成学习。
    对于提高政治学习的思想水平方面，应该寄予特殊注意。政治小组和学校中的每门功课，每一次讲演或座谈，都应该是在政治上有目的的、思想内容深刻的。在政治学习中，必须强调苏维埃人民的卓越成就、苏维埃国家威力的增长和党对于青年教育的巨大关怀。
    我们的讲演、座谈和报告，都应该教育苏联青年以高度的爱国主义的情感，爱自己的祖国同时憎恨敌人。应该经常解释美帝国主义的兽性的实质，揭穿它的政策的侵略性，培养青年憎恨社会主义祖国的敌人的感情。
    青年的思想教育，不能只局限于政治教育。共青团组织应该尽可能更广泛地利用一切在思想上影响青年的方式和方法。
    在许多共和国和省中举行过的共青团代表大会和代表会议，表示出苏联青年精神方面的巨大进步、对知识和高度文化的渴望。代表大会和代表会议的代表们，对共青团的领导机关正当地提出了要更深刻地研究思想工作问题的重要要求。在乌兹别克斯坦的共青团代表大会上人们曾指出：对科学、文学和艺术的粗暴的资产阶级民族主义的歪曲，曾给青年教育带来了损害，但乌兹别克共青团中央委员会过去却不注意思想工作问题。在吉尔吉兹共青团代表大会上，人们曾指出共和国共青团中央委员会不注意共和国青年科学家的活动，不帮助他们制订揭露封建氏族的和民族主义的残余的讲义。
    共青团组织必须时时深入到各文化机关——学校、俱乐部、高等学校、剧院、博物馆——的活动中去，经常关怀创作青年——青年科学家、文学家、演员、画家——的思想教育，帮助他们进行创作。
    共青团组织的一个最重要任务，是尽力加强思想工作，使思想工作的解决服从于共产主义建设的任务，教育青年以共产主义的态度对待劳动，坚决地和破坏劳动纪律的现象、和个别工作人员对事业的粗枝大叶的态度进行斗争。
    我们在青年中的全部思想工作，应该是把苏联人的新的一代教育成具有深刻思想的、忠实于列宁—斯大林党的事业的人，教育成共产主义的建设者。
