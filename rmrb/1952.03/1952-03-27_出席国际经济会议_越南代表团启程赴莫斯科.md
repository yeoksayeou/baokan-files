    To Attend International Economic Conference
    Vietnamese Delegation Departs for Moscow
    [Xinhua News Agency, 25th] According to Vietnam News Agency, the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the International Economic Conference left Vietnam for Moscow in early March. The head of the delegation is Zheng Wenbing (Deputy Minister of Finance of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam), and the members include: Nguyen Son Ha (industrialist), Nguyen Thanh Ha (cadre of the Vietnam Farmers' National Salvation Association), and Deng Wenrong (Director of the General Office of the Economic and Financial Committee of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam). Delegation leader Zheng Wenbing told the Vietnam News Agency that the Vietnamese people warmly welcome the International Economic Conference held in Moscow. Vietnam has abundant resources. Under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people's war of liberation has continuously achieved victories. The liberated areas are expanding day by day, and restoration work is underway there. This provides enormous possibilities for developing foreign trade. The Vietnamese delegation hopes to exchange views with representatives from various countries at the Moscow conference and contribute its efforts to the success of the conference.

    出席国际经济会议
    越南代表团启程赴莫斯科
    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社消息：参加国际经济会议的越南民主共和国代表团，已在三月初离越南赴莫斯科。代表团团长是郑文炳（越南民主共和国财政部副部长），团员包括：阮山河（工业家）、阮清河（越南农民救国会干部）、邓文荣
    （越南民主共和国经济财政委员会办公厅主任）。代表团团长郑文炳对越南通讯社记者发表谈话说：越南人民热烈欢迎在莫斯科举行国际经济会议。越南有着丰富的资源。在胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府的英明领导下，越南人民的解放战争不断取得了胜利。解放地区正在逐日扩大，恢复工作正在那里进行着。这就为发展对外贸易提供了巨大的可能性。越南代表团希望在莫斯科会议上和各国代表交换意见，并为会议的成功贡献其力量。
