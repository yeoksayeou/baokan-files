    Let Us Work Together to Strive for the Final Victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
    ——A Letter of Reply from a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Female Conductors of the Beijing Train Section

To all the female conductors of the Beijing Train Section Women's Contract Group:

    We were infinitely excited and encouraged to read your New Year's letter to us in the 50th issue of the "Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea Special Edition." When we learned that you are the first group of female conductors on the nation's streamlined trains, we were proud of the new type of train in our motherland and even more delighted that you have mastered the new technology.

    Although we are on the Korean battlefield, our hearts are connected with the motherland. Every time we hear about the new achievements of the motherland, we gain infinite strength. We feel that with the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and such a vast, hardworking, brave, and excellent people, we have full confidence in defeating the aggression of US imperialism.

    In addition to expressing our gratitude to you and wishing you greater victories, all of us commanders and fighters guarantee to you: we will never waste the things that the people of the motherland have produced and donated with their blood and sweat; we will strive to practice thrift, pay attention to cherishing and saving clothing, equipment, weapons, ammunition, and provisions, to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, and to answer your enthusiastic support.

    Let us work together to strive for the final victory in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea!

    The headquarters of the 12th Detachment of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, all commanders and fighters

    让我们为争取抗美援朝最后胜利共同努力
    ——志愿军某部给北京列车段女乘务员的回信北京列车段妇女包乘组全体同志们：
    在第五十期“抗美援朝专刊”上读到了你们给我们的拜年信，我们感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。当我们知道了你们是祖国流线型火车的第一批女乘务员时，我们为祖国出现了新型列车而骄傲，更为你们掌握了新技术而庆贺。
    我们虽然在朝鲜战场上，但我们的心是和祖国连在一起的。每逢听到祖国的新成就，我们就会增加无限的力量。我们感到，祖国有伟大的毛主席领导，有这样广大的勤劳勇敢的优秀人民，我们对于打败美帝国主义的侵略是有充分信心的。
    除了向你们表示感谢并祝你们获得更大的胜利外，我们全体指战员并向你们保证：对祖国人民用血汗增产捐献出来的东西，决不随便浪费；我们要努力实行节约，注意爱护和节省被服、装备、武器、弹药和粮秣，以响应毛主席的伟大号召，以回答你们的热烈支援。
    让咱们为争取抗美援朝的最后胜利而共同努力吧！
    志愿军某部十二大队队部全体指战员
