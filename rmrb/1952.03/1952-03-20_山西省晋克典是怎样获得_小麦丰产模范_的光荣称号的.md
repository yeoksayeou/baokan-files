Editor's Note: The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, the Agricultural, Forestry and Water Conservancy Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee, and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Shanxi Province formed the "Jin Kedian High-Yield Investigation Group" to investigate Jin Kedian's experience in high-yield dryland wheat in Yuxiang County, Shanxi Province. The following is the investigation report of this investigation group.

Jin Kedian is a native of Puleitou Village, Third District, Yuxiang County, Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province, and is 67 years old this year. He was born into a poor peasant family and has been engaged in agriculture since childhood, exploring a lot of experience in farming techniques. Before liberation, he lived in extreme poverty, and his talents could not be brought into play. After liberation, through land reform, and with the support and rewards of the People's Government, his political awareness gradually increased, and his enthusiasm and creativity in production continued to improve. Especially in wheat cultivation, he has achieved great results.

In the past three years, Jin Kedian's wheat yield has been increasing year by year. In 1949, his average wheat yield was 155 jin per mu, in 1950, the average yield was 194 jin per mu, and in 1951, the average yield reached 245 jin per mu. Among them, 2.5 mu of land grew the best, with an average yield of 502 jin per mu. At the district-wide wheat high-yield appraisal meeting held by the Yuncheng Prefectural Commissioner's Office in August 1951, he won the glorious title of "Wheat Production Model".

The quality of Jin Kedian's land is the same as that of the local people. The reason why his wheat yield is much higher than that of the masses is mainly because he has many innovations in farming techniques. His main high-yield experiences are as follows:

I. Early Ploughing and Deep Ploughing, Diligent Harrowing and Weeding

In terms of land preparation, his main methods are early ploughing in the dog days, deep ploughing, and diligent harrowing and weeding in autumn. This can conserve moisture and cultivate land fertility. He often said: "If you work hard and carefully ponder (i.e., explore experience), you will harvest more grain." He grows dryland wheat once a year. After the previous season's wheat is harvested, he sends manure to the wheat stubble field, spreads the manure, and then hoes it once between the wheat stubble rows. The wheat stubble is covered with manure and soil, which is easy to rot. Then, the wheat stubble ridges are opened into ditches to allow the soil to weather and store moisture. After half a month, when it is almost time for the dog days, the land is raked flat, and a seven-inch step plow is used to deeply plough it once. After ploughing, it is not raked, so that the turned-up lower soil is fully exposed to the high heat of the dog days, weathered, and easily receives a large amount of summer rain. Every ten days or so after ploughing, a *lou* (also called a knife *lou*, a unique animal-drawn weeding device in southern Shanxi) is used to *lou* it once to prevent weeds from consuming the fertilizer and moisture in the soil. At the end of the dog days, it is finely plowed again to turn the weathered soil on the top down and the unweathered soil on the bottom up, so that all the soil has the opportunity to weather. The second application of manure is applied before ploughing, and the land is still not raked after ploughing. After the end of summer heat, it is raked and harrowed once, and then raked and harrowed once after each rain to maintain soil moisture. He calls this method "collecting moisture". Because the main purpose of ploughing the land during the dog days is to weather the soil and receive rainwater, there is no need to rake and harrow after ploughing, so that the ground surface is uneven, increasing the weathering area; and making it easier for rainwater to penetrate and reduce erosion. After the end of summer heat, the climate has turned to autumn coolness, and the soil has been properly weathered, so it is necessary to pay attention to harrowing and weeding to cut off the capillary tubes in the soil and prevent the loss of the received water. Later, when it is time for sowing, if the soil is saturated and hard, he will shallowly plough, finely rake and weed it once. After a series of ploughing, raking and weeding, the soil can be kept moist and loose, which is conducive to the germination of wheat seeds and the growth of seedlings. In addition, by regularly repairing the corners and edges of the land, the soil in the entire field is universally improved, and the fertility of the land is enhanced.

II. Applying a Large Amount of Fertilizer, Applying Basal Fertilizer Early

He often said: "People are iron, food is steel, people get flustered when they don't eat, and the fields don't grow without manure." His 2.5 mu of high-yield land had more than 24,000 jin of mixed composted manure applied, an average of more than 9,000 jin per mu. Other land also had more than 4,500 jin of manure applied per mu. When sowing, 5 jin of cooked rapeseed was applied per mu as fertilizer. The rapeseed was first drilled into the soil four inches deep with a *lou*, and then wheat was sown about an inch above the rapeseed. In addition, he also applied topdressing fertilizer (soil manure) of 1,500 jin to 4,500 jin per mu before the ground froze. He said: "The land becomes as dear as a mother after three years of planting. How can it work if you don't let it eat its fill of manure?" He pays attention to accumulating fertilizer anytime and anywhere. He said: "Others worry about not having manure to apply, but I never worry; as long as you are diligent, there is manure everywhere." He feeds three cows, which can produce more than 20,000 jin of manure per month; in addition, he also digs green mud from the pond and rotten house soil, pit soil, and ash residue as fertilizer. Because he applies a lot of manure, his wheat seedlings grow particularly well. Fertilizer is extremely scarce in southern Shanxi, and most dryland wheat is not fertilized, or only fertilized once every three to five years. Jin Kedian not only applies a lot of fertilizer, but also applies fertilizer at a very appropriate time. He advocates applying basal fertilizer early, and applying cattle manure to sticky dryland. This can promote soil weathering and facilitate the reproduction of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Wheat can grow vigorously when it receives sufficient nutrients during the seedling stage. The quality of wheat seedlings has a decisive impact on yield. Secondly, the topdressing fertilizer he applied in winter can catch up with the needs of wheat growth in the coming year, so as to avoid insufficient fertility before wheat matures, affecting grain filling.

III. Preventing Cold and Drought, Conserving Water and Protecting Seedlings

He often said: "We can't stick to old ways; we have to think of new methods." Every year, when the ground is about to freeze, he applies topdressing fertilizer (soil manure) once, scattering it in the wheat ridges. He calls this "warming ditch manure." He then rolls the wheat field once to closely combine the wheat roots with the soil particles, so that the cold wind does not blow into the soil. Flattening the ridge back with a roller can hold the wheat seedlings, which are both cold-resistant and goose-resistant (geese often eat wheat seedlings in southern Shanxi before winter every year). In December, he harrows it again to loosen the surface soil, retain moisture, and keep the wheat seedlings growing in warm soil. In the spring, he rolls and harrows it again to compact the soil that has been loosened by the winter frost, so that the soil and roots are closely connected. After the thaw, he harrows it once to loosen the topsoil and increase moisture retention, which is conducive to the greening and growth of wheat seedlings. After that, he hoes it more, which can not only remove weeds and protect seedlings, but also resist drought. During the Rain Water solar term, he shallowly hoes the wheat field once to loosen the topsoil, cover the cracks, prevent the cold wind from blowing on the wheat roots, reduce water evaporation, and remove the roots of weeds. During the Qingming Festival, he uses a *lou* to *lou* it once, and then hoes it again after half a month. After that, he hoes it every time it rains, and hoes it even more often when it doesn't rain for a long time, until the wheat is too tall to hoe. After such diligent hoeing, his wheat field not only does not have the phenomenon of solid hardening, but also always maintains sufficient moisture, prevents spring drought, and guarantees the growth of wheat seedlings.

IV. Emphasizing Seed Selection, Sowing at the Right Time

He said: "Seeds cannot be handled carelessly; everything must be planned." His wheat variety is the "Small Awn Wheat" adapted to the local conditions. It is selected by the ear in the field, and then winnowed, dried and stored. When sowing, every ten jin of seeds is mixed with five qian of red arsenic (arsenic) to prevent underground pests and ensure full emergence. He sows on time during the Autumn Equinox solar term. He understands the principle that dryland sowing should be slightly deeper than paddy fields, so sowing is generally slightly deeper than others, but very uniform. Therefore, his wheat seedlings emerge neatly, strongly, and are less prone to diseases and insect pests.

The main difficulties in wheat production in southern Shanxi are lack of fertilizer and water. However, he has explored a good set of experiences in cultivating land fertility and maintaining soil moisture. He uses early ploughing, multiple ploughing, and deep ploughing to promote soil weathering and increase land fertility; and uses fine harrowing, multiple harrowing, diligent intertillage, and timely intertillage to prevent cold and drought, conserve water and protect seedlings. He uses this entire set of farming techniques to solve the local difficulties of lack of fertilizer and water, and has achieved high yields. Of course, Jin Kedian still has some shortcomings in technology. For example, the amount of fertilizer he applies is very large, but the quality is poor; the main components of the fertilizer he applies are fallen house soil and coal cinder, which are beneficial for improving clayey soil, but the fertilizer effect is not great, and fine fertilizer must also be added, and fast-acting topdressing fertilizer must be applied in the coming spring. The sowing rate should also be appropriately increased. In this way, the yield may be even higher.

    山西省晋克典是怎样获得“小麦丰产模范”的光荣称号的
    晋克典丰产调查组
    编者按：中央人民政府农业部、华北行政委员会农林水利局、山西省农林厅组成“晋克典丰产调查组”，到山西省虞乡县调查了晋克典旱地小麦丰产的经验，下面是这个调查组的调查报告。
    晋克典是山西省运城专区虞乡县三区普乐头村人，现年六十七岁。他是贫农出身，自幼即从事农业，对于耕作技术，摸索出不少经验。在解放以前，他过着极贫困的生活，他的特长无从发挥。解放以后，经过土地改革，在人民政府的扶持和奖励下，他的政治觉悟逐渐提高，生产积极性和创造性也不断提高。特别在种植小麦上，有极大成绩。
    近三年来，晋克典的小麦产量是逐年提高的。一九四九年他的小麦产量每亩平均一百五十五斤，一九五○年每亩平均一百九十四斤，一九五一年每亩产量平均就达到二百四十五斤。其中有二亩五分地长得最好，每亩平均产麦五百零二斤。在一九五一年八月运城专署召开的全区小麦丰产评比会议上，他获得了“小麦丰产模范”的光荣称号。
    晋克典的土地的质量和当地群众相同。他的小麦产量所以能高于群众很多，主要是因为他在耕作技术上有许多创造。他的丰产经验主要的有以下几点：
    一、早耕深耕，勤耙勤耨
    在整地方面，他的主要办法是伏天早耕，深耕，入秋勤加耙耨。这样可以保蓄水分，培养地力。他常说：“勤耕作，细揣摸（即摸索经验），粮食就会打得多。”他种的是一年一季的旱地小麦。在前季小麦收割后，他就把粪送到麦茬地，把粪撒开，随即在麦茬行间耠一遍。麦茬被粪和土盖住，容易沤烂。随后把麦茬垅背开成沟，使土壤风化，蓄纳水分。经过半月，到快入伏时，再把地耙平，用七寸步犁深耕一遍，耕后不耙，使翻上来的下层土壤充分受到伏天高热阳光的曝晒而风化，并便于大量接受夏天雨水。犁后每隔十多天，就用?耧（也叫刀耧，是晋南特有的畜拉除草器）?一次，不让杂草消耗土中肥料和水分。末伏时再细犁一次，把上面已风化的土翻下去，把下面没有风化的土翻上来，使全部土壤都有风化的机会。在犁前上第二次粪，犁后仍不耙。到处暑以后，耙耱一次，以后下一次雨就耙耱一次，保持土壤水分。他把这种作法，叫做“收墒”。因为伏天耕地主要目的是风化土壤，接纳雨水，所以耕后不需耙耱，使地表凹凸不平，增大风化面积；并使雨水易于渗入，减少冲刷。处暑以后，气候已转入秋凉，土壤已适当风化，必须重视耙耨，切断土壤毛细管，阻止已接纳的水分散失。以后到下种时，如墒饱土硬，他又浅耕细耙耨
    一次。这样经过一连串的耕耙耨，就可保持土壤湿润松绵，有利于小麦种子的发芽和幼苗生长。再加上经常修整地角和边沿，全田土壤得到普遍改良，地力得以增强。
    二、大量施肥，早施基肥
    他常说：“人是铁，饭是钢，人不吃饭发慌，田禾没粪不长。”他的二亩五分丰产地里，上了混合堆粪二万四千多斤，每亩平均九千多斤。别的地每亩上粪也在四千五百斤以上。在下种时，每亩又上了煮熟的菜子五斤作肥料，把菜子先用耧耩到土里四寸深的地方，然后再在菜子上约一寸多的地方播种小麦。此外，他又在上冻前每亩施追肥（土粪）一千五百斤到四千五百斤。他说：“地种三年亲似娘，不让吃饱粪土那还行？”他随时随地都注意积肥。他说：“别人愁没粪上，我可永不愁；只要脚手一勤，到处都有粪。”他喂了三头牛，每月可出圈粪两万斤以上；另外还挖池中的青泥和坏了的屋土坑土及灰渣作粪。因为他上粪多，所以他的麦苗格外长得好。晋南肥料异常缺乏，一般旱地麦多不施肥，或隔三、五年才施一次肥。晋克典不仅施肥多，而且施肥时期很适当。他主张早施基肥，并且把牛粪下在黏性的旱地里。这样可以促进土壤的风化，并便于氮素细菌繁殖。小麦在幼苗时期得到充分的养料，就能蓬勃生长。小麦的幼苗长得好坏，对产量是有决定性的影响的。其次，他在冬季加施的追肥，可赶上来年小麦生长需用，以免小麦成熟前肥力不足，影响结实。
    三、防寒防旱、蓄水保苗
    他常说：“不能死守陈规，要想新法子。”他到每年地快上冻时，上一次追肥（土粪），撒在麦垅里。他把这叫做“暖沟粪”。随着把麦田碾一次，使麦根和土粒密切结合，使冷风不致吹入土中。垅背土碾平了，就可把麦苗拥住，既能耐寒，又能防雁（晋南每年冬前常有雁吃麦苗）。到腊月间他再耱一次，以松起表土，保持水分，使麦苗经常生长在温暖的土壤里。开春时再碾耱一次，压实经冬冻松的土壤，使土和根部密接。解冻后耙一次，使表土疏松，增加保墒力，以利麦苗返青生长。以后他就多锄，这不仅能除草保苗，并且能抗旱。他在雨水节时把麦田浅锄一次，疏松表土，掩塞裂缝，防止冷风吹着麦根，并可减少水分蒸发，除去杂草宿根。到清明节时，再用?耧耧一次，经半月后再锄一次。以后每下雨就锄一次，久不下雨更要多锄，直到麦高不能下锄为止。经过这样勤锄，他的麦田不但不发生坚固硬结的现象，还经常保持着充足的水分，防止了春旱，保证了麦苗的生长。
    四、重视选种，适时播种
    他说：“种子不能马虎下，什么都得有计划。”他的麦种是适应风土的“小芒麦”，在场内穗选，又经过风选，晒干贮藏。下种时每十斤种子拌红砷（砒）五钱，以防止地下害虫，保证出苗齐全。他在秋分节时按时下种。他懂得旱地播种应较水地略深的道理，播种一般比别人稍深，但非常均匀。因此，他的小麦出苗整齐、健旺，而且少生病虫害。
    晋南地区小麦生产上的主要困难，是缺肥缺水。他却摸索出了一套培养地力和保持土壤水分的好经验。他用早耕、多耕、深耕的办法来促进土壤风化，增加地力；运用细耙耱、多耙耱、勤中耕、适时中耕的办法来防寒防旱，蓄水保苗。他用这一整套的耕作技术，解决了当地缺肥缺水的困难，获得了丰产。当然，晋克典在技术上还是有若干缺点的，如他上的肥料，数量很多，但质量差；他上的肥料中主要成份是落房土和煤渣，这些东西对改良黏质土壤是有好处的，但肥效不大，还须要加施细肥，并在来春施用速效性追肥。播种量也还要再适当地多一些。这样，产量就可能更高。
