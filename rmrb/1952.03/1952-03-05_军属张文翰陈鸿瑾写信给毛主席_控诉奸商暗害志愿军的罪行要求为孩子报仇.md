To our respected Chairman Mao:

You and the Party led us to liberation. Our children, under your great and correct call, all joined the revolution. My eldest son, Shiming, heroically sacrificed himself in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. My younger son is working for the government in Tianjin; my daughter followed the Fourth Field Army south and is now working at a military academy in Guangzhou; my eldest daughter-in-law is a yarn worker with seven years of experience at Tianjin Cotton Mill No. 4; my younger daughter-in-law works for the Tianjin Women's Federation. They have respectively joined the Party or the League and are working very actively. One of us has been a staff member in the railway for over thirty years, and the other is also actively working in the neighborhood. I am very happy to live in such a family; I am very excited to witness the victories on the Korean front and the achievements of national construction.

After the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, I actively participated in this great struggle. Mayor Huang Jing sent representatives to visit the families of martyrs and workers, and we told them our opinions. I am grateful for the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government. We are working hard to assist the comrades of the visiting delegation in their work, and we believe that under your leadership and the leadership of the great and correct Chinese Communist Party, we will defeat the bourgeoisie's wild attack on the People's Government and achieve complete victory.

In the past few days, the newspapers have continuously exposed the heinous and extremely reactionary crimes of奸商 who暗害Volunteer Army soldiers. When undertaking the manufacture of military shoes, canned food, and emergency kits, they cut corners and substituted inferior materials to暗害Volunteer Army soldiers. They used rotten meat as good meat for our heroic sons and daughters to eat. Our children fell ill in difficult circumstances and took fake medicines sold to the Volunteer Army by奸商; our outstanding children were wounded but refused to leave the front lines, and they were crippled by using emergency kits made of dirty cotton by奸商, unable to continue fighting. The inhuman and outrageous acts of奸商 in殘害Volunteer Army soldiers are absolutely intolerable. We are very angry. We want to avenge our innocent children who sacrificed themselves. We demand severe punishment for奸商 who help American imperialism.

Sincerely,
Zhang Wenhan, Tianjin Railway Sub-bureau Nursery
Chen Hongjin, No. 40 Hebei Road, Tianjin First District

    军属张文翰陈鸿瑾写信给毛主席
    控诉奸商暗害志愿军的罪行要求为孩子报仇敬爱的毛主席：
    您和党领导我们得到了解放，我们的孩子在您的伟大正确的号召下，都参加了革命。我的大儿子世铭在抗美援朝的战斗中英勇地牺牲了；小儿子在天津参加了政府工作；女孩随第四野战军南下，现在广州军校工作；大儿媳是天津棉纺四厂有七年工龄的摇纱工人；小儿媳在天津妇联工作。他们分别入了党或团，工作都很积极。我俩人一个在铁路作职员三十多年了，一个在街道工作也很积极。我在这样的家庭中生活，是很幸福的；我目睹朝鲜前线的胜利及祖国建设的成就，是非常兴奋的。
    反贪污、反行贿运动开始后，我积极参加了这一伟大的斗争。黄敬市长派了代表到我们烈属、工属家里来访问，我们把意见都说了。我感谢共产党及人民政府的关怀。我们努力协助访问团的同志们进行工作，我们相信在您及伟大正确的中国共产党领导下，是会打退资产阶级向人民政府的猖狂进攻，是会完全胜利的。
    几天来，报纸上连续揭发了丧心病狂、极其反动的奸商暗害志愿军的罪行。他们在承制军鞋、罐头、救急包时，偷工换料，暗害志愿军。他们拿臭肉当好肉，给我们的英勇的儿女们吃。我们的儿女在艰苦困难的环境中生了病，吃奸商卖给志愿军的假药；我们的优秀儿女受伤不下火线，用了奸商们拿脏棉花做的救急包却残废了，不能继续作战了。奸商这些伤天害理残害志愿军的行为，是决不能容忍的。我们非常忿恨，我们要为我们无辜牺牲的儿女报仇，我们要求严惩帮助美帝国主义的奸商。此致敬礼
