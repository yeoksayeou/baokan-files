    Lu Xun and Gogol
    --Written for the Centenary of Gogol’s Death
    Feng Xuefeng

    "Lu Xun and Gogol" is a very meaningful topic. This is a problem that should be analyzed when studying Lu Xun's works, and it is also the problem that should be paid most attention to in order to understand Gogol's influence on Chinese literature. However, limited by my academic ability and time, I can only talk about some personal opinions now, and I can't call it research.

    I.

    Lu Xun was one of the first Chinese literary workers to come into contact with Gogol. As early as 1907, when he wrote the essay "On the Power of Mara Poetry" to introduce poets such as Byron and Shelley, Pushkin and Lermontov to the Chinese people to advocate revolution against the Manchu Dynasty, he had already mentioned Gogol. He was studying in Japan at this time. He knew Gogol and read Gogol's works during the period before 1907 and after 1902, because he began to study literary works of Russia and Northeast European countries after he went to Japan to study in 1902.

    At this time, Lu Xun was a young man in his twenties. He already had a clear and firm patriotic will, as he said in a lyric poem written in 1903 - "I recommend Xuanyuan with my blood" - to be a revolutionary patriot who revitalizes the motherland. Therefore, the works he studied and read enthusiastically at this time were all works of revolutionary patriotic poets and writers. In addition to Byron and Pushkin mentioned above, there were also Mickiewicz of Poland, Heine of Germany, and Petőfi of Hungary.

    Therefore, this is the first point that should be noted: Lu Xun searched, selected, studied, and introduced revolutionary patriotic poets and writers in world literature from his own revolutionary and patriotic standpoint and intention. Poets and writers who were not like this were not noticed by him.

    Lu Xun also treated Gogol with such a standpoint and intention. First of all, he believed that Gogol was a patriot like Pushkin and Lermontov; secondly, he believed that Gogol was engaged in "depicting the darkness of social life" based on the patriotic purpose. He believed that these three people were the creators of the beautiful and great Russian literature in the nineteenth century. Lu Xun's correct understanding at that time was the basis for his attitude towards Pushkin and Gogol and others.

    In the essay "On the Power of Mara Poetry," regarding Gogol, Lu Xun said:

    "...Russia's silence contains a resounding echo. Russia is like a Confucian scholar, but not a mute; Russia is like an undercurrent, but not an ancient well. In the early nineteenth century, Gogol arose, using invisible tears and sorrowful expressions to shake his countrymen..." (Gogol is Gogol - Xuefeng note)

    These words show Lu Xun's attitude towards Gogol and his starting point for valuing Gogol.

    As Lu Xun himself confessed, Gogol had a relatively obvious influence on Lu Xun in establishing his own realism; but this influence began when he was a young man who wanted to be a patriot, and he started from his revolutionary and patriotic standpoint and will, and maintained his independent and active spirit from the beginning.

    Therefore, it is very important, I think, to pay attention to this point first. First, pay attention to Lu Xun's attitude and spirit towards the excellent literary properties of the world, that is, the "borrowing" mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong and the "learning from" mentioned by Lu Xun himself, rather than following the old ways, then it is possible to understand why Lu Xun's realism has been helped by the influence of Russian and Northeast European literature, and it is completely independent, national, and most richly original of Lu Xun himself. Because Lu Xun took an independent attitude to learn from Gogol, and at the same time because he was in the era of the Chinese revolution, his realism was naturally more advanced and more revolutionary than that of Gogol and others.

    Second, only in this way can we understand: what is the real influence of Gogol on Lu Xun and Chinese new literature? That is, Gogol's patriotism and his profound exposure of social darkness and sharp, genius satire and criticism.

    II.

    Secondly, we can go further and look at the more specific situation of this influence from the creation of Lu Xun - the founder and master of Chinese realistic new literature.

    As mentioned above, what Lu Xun, a patriot, valued was Gogol's patriotism. Therefore, when it comes to Gogol's influence on Lu Xun, first of all, we should look at it in terms of the spirit of literature, that is, in the attitude towards the social purpose and function of literature; and then in terms of literary methods.

    When Lu Xun began to approach literature, he believed that literature served the nation and the people, and that literature was a powerful tool for transforming society and transforming people's consciousness; therefore, when he began to create, he belonged himself to the so-called "art for life school." The establishment of his initial literary attitude was fundamentally from his revolutionary thoughts, but it also benefited from the influence of the literature of Russia and Northeast European countries. Such influence, of course, did not come from Gogol alone.

    Lu Xun in his youth and the "May Fourth" period chose the position of a democrat revolutionary enlightener for himself in the patriotic and revolutionary cause of the people. Therefore, he believed that the task of literature was to criticize the darkness of society and politics and the shortcomings in the people's ideology. In this way, so-called critical realism, especially the realism in Russian literature pioneered by Pushkin, Gogol, and others, was particularly valued and "learned from" by him. In this way, it is natural to absorb the characteristics of Russian literature in terms of method. This, of course, did not come from Gogol alone, but the relationship with Gogol is relatively obvious and there are more traces to be found.

    The more obvious and traceable influence of Gogol on Lu Xun is Lu Xun's first short story written in vernacular in 1918 (which is also the first novel in Chinese new literature) - "Diary of a Madman." This is a tentative work created by Lu Xun "learning from" Gogol's short story also called "Diary of a Madman" (written in 1833-34, published in 1835), which is very similar to Gogol's "Diary of a Madman" in terms of genre, the depth and sharpness of the dissection. But the theme, content, thought, and style are very different, which I will talk about later; here we see Gogol's significant influence on Lu Xun, but also see the beginning of Lu Xun's independent creation.

    This is Lu Xun's initial experiment in creation (he had only written one novel in classical Chinese seven years before this novel), and also his initial experiment in "learning from," and also because it is the same "Diary of a Madman," so the similarity in genre is inevitable, but the significance is still very important, mainly in that this kind of learning from takes the spirit of creation, and at the same time, it is determined by such historical conditions, that is, the modern "novel" short story genre is lacking in Chinese old literature. The imitation of literary genres must first have a resonance in literary spirit to be possible, and at the same time, it must be a creative action to become one's own. Therefore, this also becomes the beginning of Chinese literature organically absorbing foreign modern literary forms. Here, needless to say, Gogol, as one of the representatives of Russian literature that has a great influence on Chinese modern literature, has a meaning worth specially recording in this more specific relationship for the influence of Lu Xun and Chinese modern literature. This is what Lu Xun himself clearly mentioned in his autobiography. Secondly, in Lu Xun, what he wanted to "learn from" Gogol and what he successfully learned from him was the depth and sharpness of psychological analysis and the sharpness of social criticism. These are Gogol's specialties, and Lu Xun has completely successfully learned these advantages from this teacher, and in his first work, these advantages are no less than his teacher and show his own excellence, because he has been developing in his original direction from the beginning.

    The superficial resemblance in genre and the traces of imitation that still remain are not important; what we think is of great significance is that this creative "learning from" is the establishment of modern literary forms and spirit in China. This is to be attributed to Lu Xun's independent spirit and creation, but it also benefits from the inspiration and demonstration of Russian literature and Gogol's creative work, which has historical significance in our literary development. In addition, what is more important for Lu Xun and Chinese modern literature is the method characteristics that embody the spirit of Russian literature, that is, the characteristics of psychological analysis and social criticism, which have a greater inspirational effect on the development of Lu Xun's independent creation.

    In short, the patriotic and independently creative Lu Xun completed his great people's literary career in his life. At the beginning, the great Russian literature and the great Gogol obviously had a great influence on him in terms of literary spirit and literary methods.

    We say Russian literature because the main influence is still the comprehensive influence of the entire Russian literature; Gogol is only relatively closely related to Lu Xun; if we talk about individual writers, we must not forget Korolenko, Garshin, Chekhov, the early Andreev, and Sienkiewicz of Poland, and others for their certain influence on him.

    However, whether for studying Lu Xun's creation or for studying this influence, we must especially value the development of Lu Xun's independent creation; because without independent creation, the influence will not be profound, will not take root, that is to say, will not be effective; if we do not pay attention to this aspect of research, we will not be able to understand where the real influence lies, and we will not be able to understand the spirit of independent creation.

    To study how a writer accepts the influence of the literature of other nations in creative work, it is originally necessary to study the social development conditions of the two nations, but it would take too long to talk about it, so let's skip it here and do a historical comparative study when we have the opportunity.

    The basis and key to Lu Xun's spirit of independent creation lies in his using literature as a tool for serving the nation and the people. For him, serving the people is the purpose of everything. Whether it is literary spirit, literary method, his independent creation, or "learning from" others, they all obey this purpose. This is also the key to our understanding of the problem.

    Let's compare the two "Diary of a Madman" together.

    Gogol's "Diary of a Madman" writes about a petty official, a "ninth-rank civil official," who goes mad because he is of low rank and has no right to love the director's daughter he loves. In his madness, he also consciously feels that his life and status are much more humble than the dog that the director's daughter dotes on. So he fantasizes that he is the King of Spain, secretly tailors his coat into a "dragon robe," and is finally locked up in a mental hospital, suffering countless abuses. But in the mental hospital, he still thinks he is in the "torture chamber" of the Spanish royal family, not in his own Russian land. The end of the diary is written like this: "On the left is the sea, on the right is Italy; the Russian houses can be seen far away. Is that my house shining with blue light in the distance? Is my mother sitting by the window? Dear mother, save your poor son!... They are torturing me!... There is no place for him to stand in the world! He is being driven out! Mother, have mercy on your sick child..."

    This is a masterpiece of Gogol sympathizing with the oppressed mediocre and weak characters. Lu Xun called this work writing out Gogol's "grief and indignation" towards society.

    But Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman" is about a person who goes mad because of the family system and the cannibalistic ethics of Chinese feudal patriarchal society, so the theme and content are not only different but also have a broader and clearer social nature than the former. The fighting nature of thought and the purpose of the theme are also stronger, so this work appears as a revolutionary bugle call against feudalism. Lu Xun himself also said: "The later 'Diary of a Madman' intends to expose the evils of the family system and ethics, but it is deeper and broader than Gogol's grief and indignation." (Preface to the second collection of Essays from the Qiejieting: Second Collection of Novels in the Grand Series of Chinese New Literature) This is a very true statement.

    At the same time, the depth and breadth of this content and thought, and the intensity of the fighting spirit, are displayed together with the excellent and independent characteristics of the literary method. The depth and sharpness of psychological analysis and the depth and sharpness of social criticism are only surpassed by Gogol's work on the same topic; and they all have Lu Xun's own brilliant characteristics full of national color. The style is also very different. I will not make a comparison here, but I can point out that Lu Xun's vigorous and graceful style comes from his strong grasp of reality and his sharp sense of society. This is the result of Lu Xun's original creation, and its source is the language of the Chinese people and the excellent traditions of Chinese literature.

    In terms of genre, Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman" is indeed very similar to Gogol's "Diary of a Madman," especially at the end. But this is only superficial, and the spirit is very different. Because Gogol's is shouting for his own mother to save his abused son, which of course also represents the voice of the abused; but Lu Xun's call to "save the children" is a revolutionary call against feudalism issued to society, and it is not a call for help at all, so let alone revolutionary, it is also much "deeper and broader" in terms of the historical and social nature of thought. This is due to the different content of the whole article and the different times of the two, but therefore, this superficial resemblance in genre does not matter much, and it is not a problem in terms of Lu Xun's independent creativity.

    I think this contrast and comparison is enough to illustrate the key to the problem.

    Besides "Diary of a Madman," it is difficult for us to see more obvious and traceable influences of Gogol or other foreign writers in Lu Xun's other works. This is because: 1. Lu Xun only received a more obvious influence from individual foreign writers this time; but if we say influence, he received the comprehensive influence of the literature of Russia and Northeast European countries, mainly in the literary spirit; in terms of method, he selectively adopted the respective strengths of each writer. As mentioned above, Lu Xun has been taking the road of independent creation from the beginning. He himself also said that he broke away from the influence of foreign writers after "Diary of a Madman." 2. The most important thing that influenced and promoted the development of Lu Xun's genius was the actual revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people and Lu Xun's own participation in the struggle.

    Because Lu Xun used literature as a tool to serve the people and treated the excellent property of world literature with an independent creative spirit, and because Lu Xun was a soldier of the people's revolution who personally participated in the struggle, and the times were different, and the national and social conditions were also different, the realism established by Lu Xun with the help of Russian literature and Gogol and others is a completely independent, Chinese, and more advanced realism than Gogol and others.

    The above is my opinion. From here, I think we can see Lu Xun's spirit, and we can also see the real significance of Russian literature and Gogol for Chinese modern literature.

    Regarding the relationship between Lu Xun and Gogol, it should of course also be mentioned that Lu Xun was the translator of Gogol's immortal epic "Dead Souls," because Lu Xun's brilliant translation is really worthy of the epic's immortal brilliant content and style, so in the relationship between Gogol and the Chinese people, and in the Sino-Soviet literary and artistic exchanges, it is a very important thing. Secondly, Lu Xun had some comments on Gogol in his later years, which are also worth valuing and studying. But here, I will not go into details.

    鲁迅和果戈理
    ——为果戈理逝世百年纪念而作
    冯雪峰
    “鲁迅和果戈理”，这是一个很有意义的题目。这是研究鲁迅创作的时候应该加以分析的问题，同时也是为了明了果戈理对于中国文学的影响所最应注意的问题。但是，因为限于我的学力，现在又限于时间，我只能谈一点个人意见，说不上什么研究。
    一、
    鲁迅是中国文学工作者中接触果戈理最早的人。早在一九○七年，他写“摩罗诗力说”论文，介绍拜伦和雪莱及普希金和莱蒙托夫等诗人给中国人民，以鼓吹反对满清皇朝的革命的时候，他已经提到了果戈理。他这时候是在日本留学。他知道果戈理以及读到果戈理的作品，当在一九○七年以前和一九○二年以后的期间，因为他是一九○二年到日本留学后，就开始研究俄罗斯及东北欧诸国的文学作品的。
    这时候，鲁迅是二十多岁的青年，他已经具有明确和坚定的爱国意志，如他在一九○三年作的一首抒情诗中所说——“我以我血荐轩辕”——要做一个振兴祖国的革命的爱国志士。因此，这时候他所热烈地研究和阅读的作品，都是富于革命性的爱国的诗人和作家的作品，除上面所说的拜伦和普希金等以外，就还有波兰的密克威支、德国的海湼、匈牙利的彼得斐等。
    所以，这是首先应该注意的一点：鲁迅是从自己革命的、爱国的立场和用意，去搜寻、选择、研究和介绍世界文学中的革命的爱国的诗人和作家的。凡不是这样的诗人和作家，都没有被他所留意。
    鲁迅也就以这样的立场和用意去对待果戈理。他首先认为果戈理是一个和普希金、莱蒙托夫等同样的爱国主义者；其次，他认为果戈理是秉于爱国的宗旨而从事着“描绘社会人生之黑暗”的。他认为这三个人就是十九世纪美丽而伟大的俄罗斯文学的创造者。鲁迅当时这个正确的认识，也就是他对普希金和果戈理等人的态度的根据。
    在论文“摩罗诗力说”中，关于果戈理，鲁迅说道：
    “……俄之无声，激响在焉。俄如儒子，而非喑人；俄如伏流，而非古井。十九世纪前叶，果有鄂戈理者起，以不可见之泪痕悲色，振其邦人……”（鄂戈理即果戈理—雪峰注）
    这几句话可以看出鲁迅对于果戈理的态度以及他看重果戈理的出发点。
    如鲁迅自己所告白，果戈理对于鲁迅在建立自己的现实主义上是有过比较明显的影响的；但这个影响就在他要作一个爱国志士的青年时候开始的，他是从他的革命的爱国的立场和意志出发的，从开始就保持着他的独立的、主动的精神的。
    所以，先注意到这一点，我以为很重要。第一，注意到了鲁迅的这种对待世界上优秀的文学财产的态度和精神，即毛泽东同志所说的“借鉴”，鲁迅自己所说的“取法”，而不是因袭，那就能够弄明白鲁迅的现实主义，为什么曾经得到了俄罗斯和东北欧诸国文学的影响的帮助，而它又是完全独立的、民族的、最富有鲁迅自己的独创性的这一个问题。由于鲁迅是以独立的态度去取法果戈理，同时又由于他是处于中国革命的时代，所以他的现实主义，又自然比果戈理等的现实主义更前进，更富有革命性。
    第二，也只有这样，才可以明白：究竟什么是果戈理对于鲁迅和中国新文学的真实的影响？那就是果戈理的爱国主义和他对于社会黑暗的深刻的揭露和警辟的、天才的讽刺和批判。
    二、
    其次，我们就可以进一步，从鲁迅——这个中国现实主义的新文学的开山祖和大师的创作上，看看这个影响的比较具体的情况。
    如上所说，爱国主义者的鲁迅所看重的，是果戈理的爱国主义。因此，说到果戈理对鲁迅的影响，首先当然在文学的精神上，即在对于文学的社会目的和作用的态度上去看；其次再在文学方法上去看。
    鲁迅开始接近文学的时候，即认为文学是服务于民族和人民的，认为文学是改造社会和改造人民意识的利器；于是在开始创作的时候，即把自己归属于所谓“为人生的艺术派”。他最初的这个文学态度的确立，根本上出自他的革命的思想，但也得力于俄罗斯和东北欧诸国的文学的影响。这样的影响，当然不是来自果戈理一个人的。
    青年时期和“五四”时期的鲁迅，在人民的爱国事业和革命事业中为他自己所选定的岗位，是做一个民主主义革命的启蒙主义者。因此，他认为文学的任务就是批判社会和政治的黑暗和批判人民思想意识中的缺点。这样，所谓批判的现实主义，尤其是普希金、果戈理等所开辟的俄罗斯文学中的这样的现实主义，就特别为他所看重和“取法”。这样，也就很自然地要摄取俄罗斯文学的方法上的特点。这当然也不是来自果戈理一个人的，但在这一点上和果戈理的关系，是比较的明显和比较的有迹象可寻。
    果戈理对鲁迅的比较明显而有迹象可寻的影响，是一九一八年鲁迅用白话写的第一篇短篇小说（也就是中国新文学的第一篇小说）——“狂人日记”。这是鲁迅“取法”果戈理的一篇也叫“狂人日记”的短篇小说（作于一八三三——三四年，发表于一八三五年）而成的一个试作，在体裁上、解剖的深刻和锋利上，都和果戈理的“狂人日记”很类似。但主题、内容、思想和风格，却很不相同，我在后面将再谈到；我们在这里就看到果戈理对鲁迅的重大的影响，但更看到鲁迅的独立创造的开始。
    这是鲁迅的创作的最初的试验（他只在这篇小说的以前七年，用文言写过一篇小说），也是他的“取法”的最初试验，同时又因为同是“狂人日记”，所以体裁上的类似是在所难免的，但意义仍很重要，主要的是在这种取法是采取创作的精神，同时又由于这样的历史条件所决定，就是近代的“新颖的”短篇小说的体裁，是为中国旧文学所缺少的。文学体裁的仿效一定先有着文学精神上的感应才有可能，同时也必须是一种创作行动才能成为自己的东西，因此，这也就成为中国文学有机地吸取外国近代文学形式的开始。这里，不用说，果戈理，作为对中国现代文学有很大影响的俄罗斯文学的代表者之一，对于鲁迅和中国现代文学的影响就在这一种比较具体的关系上有它值得特别记录的意义，这是鲁迅自己在自述中就明白地提到了的。其次，在鲁迅，他所要向果戈理“取法”和他取法得很成功的，还更在心理解剖的深刻和锋利及其批判社会的尖锐。这都为果戈理所专长，而鲁迅从这个老师这里又完全成功地学到了这些优点，并且在他的这第一篇作品里这些优点就显得不让于他的老师并显出他自己的优异，是由于他一开始就向着他独创的方向发展的缘故。
    体裁上的貌似以及还留有模仿的痕迹，关系并不重要；我们认为有重大意义的，是这种创造性的“取法”，乃是近代的文学形式和精神在中国的建立。这是要归功于鲁迅的独立精神和创造的，但也得力于俄罗斯文学和果戈理的创造工作的启发和示范作用，这后者在我们文学发展上也就具有历史的意义。加以，对于鲁迅和中国现代文学都更为重要的，是体现了俄罗斯文学精神的那方法上的特点，即心理解剖和社会批判的特点，这对于鲁迅的独立创造的发展上的启发作用是更大的。
    总之，爱国主义的、独立创造的鲁迅，一生完成了他的伟大的人民文学事业，在其开始时，伟大俄罗斯文学和伟大果戈理，在文学精神和文学方法上给他的影响，显然是很大的。
    我们说俄罗斯文学，是因为主要的还是整个俄罗斯文学的综合的影响；果戈理只是在关系上对鲁迅比较地密切；如果说到个别作家，我们也不可忘记柯罗连科、迦尔洵、契诃夫、前期的安得列夫，以及波兰的显克维支等人对他的若干影响。
    但是，无论为了研究鲁迅的创作，或为了研究这种影响，都必须特别看重鲁迅的独立创造的发展；因为没有独立创造，影响也不会深刻，不会生根，就是说，不会生效的；如果不注意这一方面的研究，也无从了解真的影响之所在，更无从了解独立创造的精神了。
    要研究一个作家在创造工作中如何接受别的民族的文学的影响，本来必须研究两个民族的社会发展的条件等问题，但说起来话长，这里且从略，等有机会时再作历史的比较研究罢。
    鲁迅的独立创造的精神的基础和关键，是在于他以文学作为对于民族和人民服务的工具。对于他，为人民服务，这是一切的目的。无论是文学精神，文学方法，他的独立创造或“取法”于人，都服从于这个目的。这也就是我们了解问题的关键。
    我们就把两篇“狂人日记”对照起来看一看罢。
    果戈理的“狂人日记”，写一个“九品文官”的小官吏，因为官职卑微而没有权利去爱他所爱上的司长的女儿，就此忧郁而发狂。他在疯狂中也自觉他的生活和地位比司长的女儿所爱宠的一只狗还要卑贱得多多。于是他就幻想自己是西班牙的国王，把大衣偷偷裁成为“龙袍”，这样终于被关进了疯人院，而受尽了无数的虐待。但他在疯人院，也还以为是在西班牙皇室的“拷刑室”里，而不是在自己的俄国国土上。日记的最后是这样写的：“左边是海，右边是意大利；俄国的房屋远远地可以看见了。那远方是不是我的家屋在闪耀着青光？我的母亲是不是正坐在窗前？亲爱的母亲呵，救救你可怜的儿子吧！……他们在磨折我！……世界上没有他站的地方！他被驱逐着！母亲，可怜可怜你这个病的孩子吧……”
    这是果戈理同情被压迫的平庸的弱小人物的一篇杰作，鲁迅称这篇作品写出了果戈理对社会的“忧愤”。
    但鲁迅的“狂人日记”，是写一个因中国封建宗法社会的家族制度和吃人的礼教的可怕而发狂的人的，所以主题、内容都不但不同，而且都比前者有更广阔和更明确的社会性。思想的战斗性和主题目的性也都更强烈，因此，这作品就作为反对封建主义的革命的一声号角而出现。鲁迅自己也说：“后起的‘狂人日记’意在暴露家族制度和礼教的弊害，却比果戈理的忧愤深广。”（且介亭杂文二集：中国新文学大系小说二集序）这是非常真实的话。
    同时，这内容思想的深广和战斗性的强烈，又是和文学方法上的优异与独立的特色而一并显示出来的。心理解剖的深刻和锋利，社会批判的深入和尖锐，比之果戈理的同题目的一篇作品来，都只有过之而无不及；并且都有鲁迅自己的、富于民族色彩的辉煌的特色。风格也是大大不同的。我不在这里作对照，但可以指出：鲁迅的苍劲挺秀的风格是他由于现实的概括力之强和对于社会的感觉的尖锐而来的，这是鲁迅独创的结果，同时它的渊源是中国人民的语言和中国文学的优秀传统。
    在体裁上，鲁迅的“狂人日记”是确实很类似于果戈理的“狂人日记”的，尤其在结尾处。但这也只是貌似，而精神又大不同。因为果戈理的是喊自己的母亲救救他这个被虐待的儿子，这当然也是代表了被虐待者的呼声；但鲁迅的“救救孩子”的号召，是对社会发出的反对封建主义的革命号召，而完全不是求救的呼声了，所以且不说革命性，即在思想的历史性和社会性上也都“深广”得远了。这是由于全篇的内容不同，更由于两人的时代不同而来的，但因此，这个体裁上的貌似，关系就不大，而在鲁迅的独立创造性上说来也不足为病了。
    我想，这一个对照和比较，已够说明问题的关键了。
    除了“狂人日记”，鲁迅的其他的作品，我们就很难看见比较明显的、有迹象可寻的果戈理或其他外国作家的影响。这是因为：一、鲁迅从个别外国作家受了比较明显影响的就只有这一次；但如果说影响，则他受的是俄罗斯和东北欧诸国文学的综合的影响，主要在文学精神上；在方法上他是分别地采取各个作家的各自的优长。如上所说，鲁迅是从开始就走独立创造的道路的，他自己也说过从“狂人日记”以后就脱离了外国作家的影响了。二、最主要地影响和推动鲁迅天才的发展的，是中国人民的实际革命斗争和鲁迅自己的参加斗争。
    由于鲁迅是以文学为替人民服务的工具而以独立的创造精神去对待世界文学上的优良财产，更由于鲁迅是亲身参与斗争的人民革命的战士，以及时代也不同，民族和社会等条件也都有不同，所以，鲁迅得力于俄罗斯文学和果戈理等人的影响而建立的现实主义，是完全独立的、中国的、并且比果戈理等人更前进的现实主义。
    以上就是我的一点意见。从这里，我以为可以看见鲁迅的精神，也可以看见俄罗斯文学和果戈理对于中国现代文学的真实意义。
    关于鲁迅和果戈理的关系，当然也应该提到鲁迅是果戈理的不朽史诗“死魂灵”的翻译者的事情，因为鲁迅的天才的辉煌的译文实在不愧于这史诗的不朽的辉煌内容和风格，所以在果戈理和中国人民的关系上，在中苏文艺交流上，都是一件很重要的事情。其次，鲁迅在晚年关于果戈理有过一些评论，也值得重视和研究。但这里，我也不详说了。
