    (I) Warmly Welcome the Investigation Delegation of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to Beijing
    The investigation delegation dispatched by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers to Korea to investigate the truth about the atrocities of the American aggressors has completed its investigation work in Korea and arrived in Beijing, China, on the 20th. On behalf of the Chinese people, this association expresses its warm respect to them. The delegation representatives come from eight countries spread across the Old and New World, including Austria, Italy, Brazil, the United Kingdom, France, China, Belgium, and Poland. Their wading through mountains and rivers to conduct investigations in war-torn Korea fully demonstrates the heroic spirit of peace-loving warriors.
    In his statement on February 24, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out that regarding the atrocities of the American aggressors spreading bacteria to kill peaceful Korean people, "If the people of the world do not resolutely stop it, then the disaster that has befallen the peaceful people of Korea today will befall the peaceful people of the world tomorrow." Therefore, the people of all countries in the world have a responsibility to stop this shameless atrocity of US imperialism, to shoulder the cause of maintaining world peace, and to resolutely defend the cause of peace. Currently, war criminals such as Acheson and Ridgway are using lies to mislead the people of the world, categorically denying their guilt in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China. The on-the-spot investigation conducted by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation delegation will greatly promote the exposure of the heinous crimes committed by US imperialism in Korea, the exposure of all the lies of Acheson, Ridgway, and others, and the further mobilization of the people of all countries to participate in the struggle to defend world peace. The efforts of the delegates of the investigation delegation will make the people of the world clearly aware of the hideous and despicable face of the American aggressors and mobilize the people of the world to fight to crush the crime of American imperialist bacteriological warfare. This is the most urgent and sacred task for striving for lasting world peace and defending human safety.
    The investigation delegation of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers is about to go to the Northeast for investigation. We wish the investigation delegation a successful completion of its work.

    （一）热烈欢迎国际民主法律工作者协会调查团来京
    国际民主法律工作者协会派往朝鲜调查美国侵略者暴行真相的调查团，已经完成其在朝鲜的调查工作，在二十日抵我国北京。本会代表中国人民谨向他们表示热烈的敬意。调查团代表来自奥地利、意大利、巴西、英国、法国、中国、比利时和波兰等分布在新旧大陆的八个国家。他们跋山涉水，前往战火迷漫的朝鲜去进行调查，这种正义的行为，充分表现了保卫和平战士的英雄气概。
    周恩来外长在二月二十四日发表的声明中曾经指出，对于美国侵略者撒布细菌杀害朝鲜和平人民的暴行，“如果全世界人民不坚决地加以制止，那么，今天落在朝鲜和平人民头上的灾难，明天就会落在世界和平人民的头上。”因此，全世界各国人民都有责任来制止美帝国主义这一无耻暴行，将维护世界和平的事业担负起来，坚强地保卫和平事业。目前艾奇逊、李奇微这些战争贩子正用谎言迷惑世界人民，矢口抵赖其在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的罪责，而国际民主法律工作者协会调查团实地进行调查，这对于揭露美帝国主义在朝鲜所犯下的滔天罪行，揭穿艾奇逊、李奇微之流的一切谎言，进一步动员各国人民参加保卫世界和平的斗争，将有着极大的推动作用。调查团诸位代表的努力，将让全世界人民清楚地知道美国侵略者的狰狞可耻的面目，动员全世界人民为粉碎美国帝国主义细菌战的罪行而斗争，这是当前为争取全世界持久和平，保卫人类安全的最紧迫的神圣的任务。
    国际民主法律工作者协会调查团即将赴东北进行调查。我们预祝调查团工作顺利完成。
