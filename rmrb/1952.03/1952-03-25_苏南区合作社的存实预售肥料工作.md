    The Cooperative's Work on Storing Actual Goods and Pre-selling Fertilizer in the Southern Jiangsu Area
    Su Nan Gong Xiao He Zuo Zong She
    Editor's Note: This year, supply and marketing cooperatives will supply a large quantity of fertilizer nationwide, but fertilizer loan funds are limited. To ensure the completion of the fertilizer supply task, in addition to a portion of the fertilizer requiring cash purchase to accelerate capital turnover, another method worth promoting is storing actual goods and pre-selling fertilizer. This means farmers first hand over their surplus actual goods (such as cotton, grain, etc.) to the supply and marketing cooperatives as circulating funds; the cooperatives then guarantee timely supply according to the amount of fertilizer pre-purchased by the farmers. This will be of great help in solving the problem of insufficient fertilizer loan funds. The typical experiment of storing actual goods and pre-selling fertilizer by the Southern Jiangsu Supply and Marketing Cooperative proves that this method can be promoted.
    Last winter, the general cooperatives of twelve counties, including Shanghai, Wuxi, and Wujin, conducted typical experiments on storing actual goods and pre-selling fertilizer. The experience of typical experiments conducted by cooperative in sixteen townships in various counties has proved that storing actual goods and pre-selling fertilizer is supported by the broad masses. With the support of party organizations and governments at all levels, and with the help of farmers' associations, this work has quickly and widely unfolded. The masses have consciously stored actual goods and pre-purchased fertilizer from the cooperatives. On average, more than 80% of the farmers in these sixteen townships who implemented storing actual goods and pre-purchasing fertilizer.
    The typical experimental work is roughly divided into three steps: First, ideological mobilization of cadres and the masses; second, collective recognition, signing of contracts, and delivery of actual goods by the masses; and third, consolidating mass sentiment and further mobilizing the masses to carry out fertilizer accumulation campaigns. The key to the success or failure of this movement lies in the quality of the ideological mobilization work. In the typical experiment, we came to the following experiences:
    First, to mobilize farmers to store actual goods and pre-sell fertilizer, it is necessary to first summarize the reasons for past harvests with the masses, and mobilize the masses to compare production achievements, so that the masses know the important role of applying more fertilizer to agricultural harvest. After the masses have confidence that more fertilizer and more application of fertilizer can increase production, they often have dependent thoughts such as "the government will lend a large amount of fertilizer." In response to this ideological situation, it is necessary to conduct education on resisting America and aiding Korea and increasing production and practicing economy, explaining the important significance of pre-selling fertilizer, so that farmers realize that to increase production and buy bean cake, they must start with frugality. After Shanghai Beiqiao Township carried out these educations in a typical experiment, some farmers at that time were prepared to save on New Year's expenses and make less non-essential clothes, and take the saved, originally planned to be sold grain to pre-purchase fertilizer. If the method of "straightforward approach" is adopted, directly proposing that farmers store actual goods and pre-purchase fertilizer, it will fail. Some say that applying bean cake fertilizer is the only way to increase production, which is also impractical, which will reduce farmers' interest in accumulating fertilizer and is harmful to production. Using coercive orders will create even worse results. A village chief in Dong? Township, Wuxi, did not patiently educate and enlighten the masses when mobilizing all the villagers to store actual goods and pre-purchase fertilizer. He only said, "Production must be increased next year, and everyone must apply more fertilizer. If you (referring to the farmers) don't subscribe, you won't be able to buy it next year, and you will be responsible for it yourselves." As a result, it caused ideological confusion among the farmers and a phenomenon of rushing to buy fertilizer occurred. Some farmers said dissatisfiedly, "It's really strange, I've never heard of paying for next year's fertilizer this year." "The cooperative wants to get our rice to do business." These phenomena all illustrate the necessity of conducting sufficient ideological education.
    Second, it is necessary to explain the relationship between the cooperative and its members. Starting from summarizing the achievements of the cooperative in serving its members, it is also necessary to explain that the cooperative's funds belong to the members, and the cooperative's purpose of running fertilizer is to support agricultural production and handle it for everyone, not to make money; to compare the price of fertilizer supplied by the cooperative this year with the price of fertilizer on the market, so that members further trust the cooperative. Explain the cooperative's financial situation to the masses so that everyone recognizes the necessity of storing actual goods and pre-purchasing. At the same time, in the implementation of storing actual goods, it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of complete voluntariness. Moreover, the amount of fertilizer subscribed by each household should not exceed its needs.
    In the implementation of storing actual goods and pre-selling, the masses have concerns, they are afraid of suffering losses due to price changes after pricing in advance. In order to solve this problem, the method of not pricing temporarily by both parties should be adopted when storing actual goods and pre-selling.
    Third, in the work of storing actual goods and pre-selling, it is best to achieve a village or a cooperative member group (or mutual aid group, production cooperative) to collectively store actual goods and sign contracts, and pre-pay actual goods. This makes it easy to create a upsurge. However, it is necessary to prevent coercive orders or wasting farmers' labor time. Shanghai Beiqiao Township adopted the method of collective storage and contract signing in groups. Under the influence of this group, it was quickly promoted to other groups, which was very effective. This not only works faster, but also makes the masses feel better; on the contrary, adopting sporadic individual storage and contract signing with the cooperative takes a long time and the movement cannot be fully developed.
    At the same time, attention should be paid to adopting the working method of starting from points to areas and leading by backbones. It should start from places with a good mass base and easy to promote, and then promote it to other places. The backbone of mobilization should be selected from truly active advanced elements, who should be able to actively work and have prestige among the masses. After the storage and pre-sale work is completed, it should also be explained that bean cake alone is not enough, and it would be better to have bean cake plus other manure; methods of actively accumulating fertilizer should be put forward to turn the movement into fertilizer accumulation and increased production. On the other hand, it should also carry out enlightenment education for farmers in individual areas that have not yet implemented storage and pre-sale, and promote it to neighboring areas through various relations of the masses.

    苏南区合作社的存实预售肥料工作
    苏南供销合作总社
    编者按：今年供销合作社在全国范围内供应肥料的数量很大，但肥贷资金有限。为了保证完成供应肥料的任务，除一部分肥料需要现款现购以加速资金周转外，另一种值得提倡的方法是存实预售肥料，即先由农民把自己所存的多余的实物（如棉花、粮食等）交给供销合作社，作为周转资金；合作社根据农民预购肥料的数目保证按时供应。这对解决肥贷资金不足的问题将会有很大帮助。苏南区供销合作总社的存实预售肥料工作典型试验，证明这个方法是可以推广的。
    上海、无锡、武进等十二个县合作总社去冬分别进行了存实预售肥料典型试验。各县合作社在十六个乡所作的典型试验的经验，证明存实预售肥料工作是广大群众所拥护的。这个工作在各地党的组织、政府的支持和农会的帮助下，很快就广泛展开。群众纷纷自觉地向合作社存实物，预购肥料。在这十六个乡实行存实预购的农户平均占总户数的百分之八十以上。
    典型试验工作大体上分三个步骤：一、对干部、群众进行思想动员；二、群众集体认购、订约、缴送实物；三、巩固群众情绪，进一步动员群众开展积肥运动。这一运动做得成功或失败的关键，决定于思想动员工作做得好或坏。在典型试验中，我们得出了以下几点经验：
    一、向农民进行存实预售肥料的动员，必须先和群众一起总结过去丰收的原因，发动群众比生产成绩，使群众知道多施肥料对农业丰收的重要作用。群众对于多积肥多施肥可以增加产量有了信心以后，又往往会产生“政府要大量贷给肥料”等依赖思想。针对这一思想情况，就必须进行抗美援朝和增产节约的教育，说明预售肥料的重要意义，使农民认识到要增产，要买豆饼，就要从节约做起。上海北桥乡在典型试验中，进行了这些教育后，有些农民当时就准备节省过年费用和少做不急需的衣服，把节约下来的、原计划卖出的粮食，拿来预购肥料。如果采取“单刀直入”的方法，直接提出要农民存实预购肥料，是会失败的。有的把施用豆饼肥料说成唯一的增产的方法，也是不合实际的，这会减低农民积肥的兴趣，对生产是有害的。用强迫命令的方式，更会造成恶果。无锡东?乡有一个村长，在对全村群众进行存实预购肥料的动员的时候，没有耐心教育启发群众，只说“明年要增产，大家要多施肥料。你们（指农民）不定购，明年就买不到，由你们自己负责。”结果引起农民思想混乱，发生了抢购肥料的现象。有些农民不满意地说：“真奇怪，从没听到过明年的肥料今年就要付钱。”“合作社想弄我们的稻子做生意。”这些现象都说明了进行充分的思想教育的必要。
    二、必须说明合作社和社员的关系。从总结合作社为社员服务的成绩说起，还要说明合作社的资金是社员的，合作社办肥料的目的是为了扶植农业生产，给大家代办的，并不是为了赚钱；要把合作社今年供应肥料的价格和市场上的肥料价格对比，使社员进一步信任合作社。把合作社资金的情况向群众讲明白，使大家认识到存实预购的必要。同时，在实行存实时，要坚决地执行完全自愿的原则。而且每户认购肥料的数量，不要超过其需要量。
    在执行存实预售工作当中，群众是有顾虑的，他们怕因事先作价后，再因物价有变动而吃亏。为解决这一问题，要采用存实预售双方暂不作价的办法。
    三、在存实预售工作中，最好做到一个村或一个合作社员小组（或互助组、生产合作社）集体存实订约，预交实物。这样容易形成热潮。但要防止强迫命令，或浪费农民劳动时间。上海北桥乡采用了以小组为单位集体存实订约的办法。在这个组的影响下，紧跟着就推广到其他小组，收效很大。这样不但工作较快，而且群众情绪也好；相反的，采用零星个别的到合作社存实订约，时间拖长了，运动也不能全面展开。
    同时，要注意采取由点到面、骨干带头的工作方法。应当从群众基础较好、容易推动的地方着手，然后向其他地方推广。动员的骨干，要选真正积极的先进分子，他们要能积极劳动，在群众中有威信。存实预售工作完成后，还要说明只靠豆饼也是不够的，有了豆饼再加上别的粪肥就更好；应提出积极积肥的办法，使运动转入积肥增产。另一方面还应向尚未实行存实预售的个别地区的农民进行启发教育，并通过群众的各种关系向临近地区推广。
