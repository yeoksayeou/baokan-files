    Immortal Internationalist Fighter
    Chen Xinghua (artwork)
    (1) On the South Slope of a village in northern Korea, there is a newly built tomb. All revolutionary soldiers and civilians who pass by this tomb pay their respects to this internationalist fighter buried on Korean soil—Comrade Luo Shengjiao, a martyr of the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    (2) Luo Shengjiao was the son of a poor peasant from Tongzi Village, Zishan District, Xinhua County, Hunan Province. He was an outstanding member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. He worked as a clerk in the reconnaissance team of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. In his work, he was always active, responsible, and unafraid of difficulties. In his diary, he wrote a short poem: "If I am hit by the aggressor's bullet, I hope you will not linger in front of my body, but continue to advance bravely and avenge the millions of Korean people and the sacrificed comrades!"
    (3) On the morning of January 2nd this year, Luo Shengjiao was walking by the river after finishing his morning exercises. At this time, four Korean children were happily skating on the river. A boy named Cui Ying suddenly fell into an ice hole more than eight feet deep; the other three children were frightened and cried.

    不朽的国际主义战士
    陈兴华　作
    （一）在朝鲜北部某村的南山坡上，有座新建的坟墓。凡是从这座墓前经过的革命军人和群众，都怀着崇敬的心情，来凭吊这位埋葬在朝鲜土地上的国际主义战士——中国人民志愿军的罗盛教烈士。
    （二）罗盛教是湖南新化县紫山区桐子村的一个贫农的儿子。他是中国新民主主义青年团的优秀团员。在中国人民志愿军某部侦察队担任文书工作，在工作中他一向是积极负责不怕艰难困苦的。在他留下来的日记本上，曾经写了这样一篇短诗：“当我被侵略者的子弹打中以后，希望你不要在我的尸体面前停留，应该继续勇敢前进，为千万朝鲜人民和牺牲的同志报仇！”
    （三）今年一月二日的早晨，罗盛教作完早操从河边走过。这时，河面上有四个朝鲜少年在快乐地滑冰。有个名叫崔?的少年，忽然失足掉入八尺多深的冰窟窿里去了；另外三个少年吓得哭叫起来。
