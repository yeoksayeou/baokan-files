    Resolutely Solve the Problem of Agricultural Fertilizer

    The decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council regarding agricultural production in 1952 sets forth the goal of striving to reach and surpass pre-war levels in agricultural production this year. The basic principle for achieving this goal is to increase yield per unit area; and one of the most effective ways to increase yield per unit area is to increase the application of fertilizer. Fertilizing farmland can not only improve the soil and provide crops with sufficient nutrients, but also increase the crops' resistance to diseases and insect pests. Under certain production conditions, the more fertilizer applied, the greater the crop yield. Through years of diligent production, the vast majority of farmers fully understand the important role of fertilizer. Proverbs such as "People depend on food, land depends on manure" and "There is no other trick to farming, the first is to have enough fertilizer" fully illustrate the relationship between fertilizer and agricultural production.

    However, currently, on a national scale, fertilizer shortage is still a very common problem. In the past, Chinese farmers suffered from the cruel exploitation of the feudal class, completely lost the ability to expand reproduction, and the amount of fertilizer applied was already very small. At present, in rural areas across the country, except for some areas that have reached or exceeded the pre-war standard of fertilizer application, in most areas, the amount of fertilizer applied by farmers has gradually increased, but it still has not reached the pre-war standard; and whether it is the former or the latter, it actually lags far behind the needs of China's agricultural development. Therefore, helping farmers solve the fertilizer problem has become one of the important tasks of Party organizations, people's governments, cooperatives, and mass organizations at all levels.

    To solve the fertilizer problem at present, it is necessary to start from two aspects. The first is to lead farmers in launching a fertilizer accumulation campaign, and the second is to supply farmers with large quantities of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer.

    In the process of agricultural production over thousands of years, Chinese farmers have accumulated a wealth of experience in accumulating fertilizer, such as raising pigs to ferment manure, collecting human waste, accumulating stable manure and compost, and collecting river mud, pond mud, silkworm dregs, and bird droppings. This is the main source of fertilizer for agriculture in China today, and farmers should be mobilized to promote it universally. Among these methods, the most effective and largest in quantity is raising pigs to ferment manure. Pig manure has a high nitrogen content and is one of the best fertilizers; at the same time, raising pigs can also increase the supply of important materials such as meat, pig bristles, and casings. People's governments at all levels should, based on the habits and wealth of local farmers, immediately formulate practical and feasible plans for raising pigs and accumulating fertilizer, and mobilize farmers to fully implement them. For some areas far from transportation lines, people's governments and cooperatives should earnestly help farmers solve the problem of pig sales; in areas with food shortages, the problem of feed for farmers raising pigs should be solved; and in all areas, attention should be paid to preventing and controlling hog cholera. Some rural workers believe that leading farmers to accumulate fertilizer is a trivial matter. They say: "Farmers can accumulate fertilizer themselves, they don't need us to manage it." This is a very wrong idea. This is a manifestation of a bureaucratic style that is only satisfied with general appeals and is unwilling to do hard work, and it must be changed immediately.

    Another source of agricultural fertilizer is cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer. This year, the People's Government has allocated 1.5 trillion yuan in fertilizer loans (excluding the Northeast region) and entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase fertilizer to supply the needs of farmers. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives will supply farmers with 2.28 million tons of cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer this year, of which an estimated 32.5 percent will be applied to paddy fields, which can increase rice production by about 2.2 million tons; 17.1 percent will be applied to wheat fields, which can increase wheat production by about 600,000 tons; 38.5 percent will be applied to cotton fields, which can increase cotton production by about 8.25 million dan; and the remainder will be applied to tobacco, hemp, and other producing areas, which, together with the above-mentioned increase in production, can reach a total of about 7 trillion yuan. Therefore, doing a good job in supplying farmers with cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer is of extremely important significance to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

    Cooperatives at all levels must implement the policy of planned, focused, and step-by-step supply when supplying fertilizer. First of all, fertilizer should be delivered to farmers in a timely manner. Farmers should be educated to apply more accumulated fertilizer during spring plowing and keep most of the cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer for topdressing in the summer and autumn seasons. Last year, cooperative departments in some areas, due to lack of experience, sold off the entire year's fertilizer during the spring plowing period. By the summer and autumn seasons, they were unable to continue to supply the fertilizer urgently needed by farmers, so that unscrupulous merchants were able to take the opportunity to raise the price of cake fertilizer and disrupt the fertilizer market. This year, cooperatives in various regions have made relatively thorough preparations in this regard, but they should also pay close attention to avoid repeating last year's lessons. Secondly, fertilizer should be used in a focused manner in grain and cotton producing areas in coordination with agricultural production increase plans, and oppose average supply. Special care should be given to some areas that grow cash crops but lack fertilizer.

    Cooperatives should sign supply and sales contracts with farmers in order to supply fertilizer and purchase agricultural products. Reasonable fertilizer prices should be determined and implemented, and the purely profit-seeking viewpoint and one-sided mass viewpoint should be opposed. Some cooperative cadres, under the influence of capitalist ideology, have developed a purely profit-seeking viewpoint. They raise fertilizer prices, which undermines farmers' enthusiasm for fertilizing and endangers agricultural production. This is contrary to the nature and mission of cooperatives. However, many cadres, especially grassroots cadres of Party and people's organizations, one-sidedly emphasize the interests of farmers and advocate keeping fertilizer prices very low, or advocate more use of purchase on credit and arrears. This is also wrong. Because the result of doing so will inevitably disrupt the state and cooperative's fertilizer supply plan, which is actually very unfavorable to farmers.

    This year, the task of supplying fertilizer by cooperatives is very heavy, and the cooperatives themselves lack sufficient funds. Therefore, cooperatives operating fertilizer in various regions should vigorously promote and popularize the method of "saving in kind and pre-selling" to absorb some of the masses' funds in advance for turnover. As long as the benefits of this method for the country and the farmers are thoroughly explained to the farmers, they can fully accept it. The Sunan area has already created good experience in this regard. Secondly, "cash sales" should be promoted to accelerate capital turnover. As for sales on credit, they are to take care of a small number of farmers in disaster areas who are unable to purchase fertilizer. In short, only by adopting various effective methods, accelerating the turnover of existing funds, and absorbing mass funds can cooperatives complete the task of supplying a large amount of fertilizer.

    Cooperatives at all levels responsible for supplying fertilizer should establish special personnel and special organizations to manage the supply of fertilizer, which is a guarantee for completing the fertilizer supply plan. Most areas have solved this problem, but cooperatives in some areas have not yet seriously solved it. These places should immediately select a group of cadres who are clean, have a correct work style, and have thoroughly confessed even if they have problems, and establish specialized organizations to lead the work of supplying fertilizer. Otherwise, delaying the farming season will cause serious losses to agricultural production.

    At present, large-scale spring plowing is about to begin. Party organizations, relevant departments of people's governments, and cooperatives in various regions must earnestly check the status of local fertilizer preparation and supply, discover problems, solve them in a timely manner, lay the foundation for increasing yield per unit area, and ensure the realization of this year's agricultural production increase plan.

### 切实解决农业肥料问题

    切实解决农业肥料问题
    中央人民政府政务院关于一九五二年农业生产的决定中，提出了今年农业生产要达到并且超过战前水平的奋斗目标。实现这个奋斗目标的基本方针是提高单位面积产量；而提高单位面积产量的最有效的办法之一是增施肥料。农田施肥，不但可以改良土壤，供给农作物以充足的养料，而且可以增加农作物抵抗病虫害的能力。在一定生产条件之下，施肥越多，农作物的产量越大。广大农民在长年勤劳生产中，是完全懂得肥料的重要作用的。“人靠饭养，地靠粪肥”、“种田无别巧，第一肥料饱”等农谚，充分地说明了肥料和农业生产的关系。
    但是，目前就全国范围说来，肥料不足，仍是一个十分普遍的问题。过去我国农民遭受封建阶级的残酷剥削，完全丧失了扩大再生产的能力，施肥量已经很少；目前全国农村，除部分地区达到或超过抗战以前的施肥标准以外，大部分地区，农民的施肥量虽然逐渐增加，但仍然没有达到战前的标准；而无论前者或是后者，实际上都远远赶不上我国农业发展的需要。因此，帮助农民解决肥料问题，已经成为各地党的组织、人民政府、合作社及群众团体的重要任务之一。
    在目前解决肥料问题，需要从两方面来着手。首先是领导农民开展积肥运动，其次是向农民供应大量的饼肥和化学肥料。
    我国农民在几千年来进行农业生产的过程中，已经积累了十分丰富的积肥经验，如养猪沤粪，收积人粪尿，积厩肥、堆肥，收积河泥、塘泥、蚕渣、鸟粪等。这是我国当前农业用肥的主要来源，应该发动农民，普遍地加以推广。在这些办法之中，收效最快、数量最大的是养猪沤粪。猪粪的含氮量很大，是最优良的肥料之一；同时养猪又可增加食肉及猪鬃、肠衣等重要物资。各级人民政府，应该根据当地农民的习惯和富力等条件，立即作出切实可行的养猪积肥的计划，发动农民全力加以实现。对于某些距离交通线较远的地区，人民政府和合作社应该切实帮助农民解决猪的销路问题；在粮食缺少地区，应该解决农民养猪的饲料问题；在所有地区，又都要注意防治猪瘟。有些农村工作人员，认为领导农民积肥是琐碎的事情，他们说：“农民自己会积肥的，用不着我们管。”这是非常错误的想法。这是一种只满足于一般号召，不肯作艰苦工作的官僚主义作风的一种表现，必须立即加以改变。
    农业肥料的另一个来源，是饼肥和化学肥料。今年人民政府已经拨出一万五千亿元的肥料贷款（东北区尚不在内），委托供销合作社购置肥料，供应农民的需要。全国合作总社今年将以二百二十八万吨饼肥和化学肥料供应农民，预计以其中的百分之三十二点五施于稻田，约可增产稻谷二百二十万吨；以其中的百分之十七点一施于麦田，约可增产小麦六十万吨；以其中的百分之三十八点五施于棉田，约可增产棉花八百二十五万担；以其余额施于烟、麻等产地，连上述增产数量，总计可达七万亿元左右。因此，做好供应农民饼肥和化学肥料的工作，对国计民生是有极为重要的意义的。
    各级合作社供应肥料，必须贯彻有计划、有重点、有步骤的供应方针。首先，应该把肥料不违农时地发到农民手里。要教育农民，在春耕时多施积肥，把大部分饼肥和化学肥料留作夏秋两季施追肥时使用。去年某些地区的合作部门，由于缺乏经验，把全年肥料在春耕期间都抛售出去，至夏秋两季，无力继续供应农民所急需的肥料，以致奸商得以乘机抬高饼肥价格，捣乱肥料市场。今年各地合作社在这一方面已经进行了比较周密的准备，但还应该切实注意，避免重复去年的教训。其次，应该配合农业增产计划，把肥料有重点地使用于粮、棉产区，反对平均供应。对于某些种植经济作物而又缺乏肥料的地区，应该予以特殊的照顾。
    合作社应该和农民订立供销合同，以便供应肥料，收购农产品。应该确定和贯彻合理的肥料价格，反对单纯营利观点和片面的群众观点。有一些合作社的干部，在资本主义思想影响之下，产生了单纯营利观点。他们抬高肥料价格，以致打击了农民施肥的积极性，危害农业生产。这是违背合作社的性质和任务的。但也有不少干部，特别是党和人民团体的基层干部，片面地强调了农民利益而主张把肥料价格压得很低，或者主张更多地采用赊购、拖欠的形式。这同样是错误的。因为这样作的结果，势必破坏国家和合作社的供肥计划，对农民实际上是很不利的。
    今年合作社供应肥料的任务很大，而合作社本身又资金不足，因此，各地经营肥料的合作社，应该大力提倡和推广“存实预售”的办法，预先吸收一部分群众的资金，以便周转。只要把这种办法对国家、对农民的好处向农民进行深入的教育，解释清楚，农民是完全可以接受的。苏南区在这一方面已经创造了很好的经验。其次，应该提倡“现售”，以加速资金周转。至于赊购，则是为了照顾少数灾区无力购买肥料的农民。总之，合作社只有采取各种有效的办法，加速现有资金的周转，并吸收群众资金，才能完成大量肥料供应的任务。
    各级负有供应肥料任务的合作社，应当设立专人和专门机构，管理供应肥料业务，这是完成供肥计划的保证。多数地区已经解决了这个问题，但部分地区的合作社至今尚未认真解决。这些地方应该立即选择一批手头干净、作风正派和虽有问题但已彻底交代的干部，建立专门机构领导供应肥料的工作。否则贻误农时，会造成农业生产的严重损失。
    目前，大规模的春耕即将展开，各地党的组织、人民政府的有关部门和合作社等，必须切实检查当地准备和供应肥料的状况，发现问题，及时解决，打下提高单位面积产量的基础，保证今年农业增产计划的实现。
