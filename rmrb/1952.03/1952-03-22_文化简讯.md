	▲ The Shanghai Film Script Writing Studio was established on March 13th. Xia Yan and Ke Ling are the director and deputy director, respectively. The film scripts created by the studio will be exclusively produced by the newly established Shanghai United Film Studio.
	After the establishment of the Shanghai Film Script Writing Studio, it will, on the one hand, organize its screenwriters to delve into the laboring people and the working masses, transform themselves in the process of participating in actual struggles, and create film scripts with modern themes. At the same time, the studio will also organize a large number of creative forces to write film scripts with historical themes, fairy tale film scripts, and short story film scripts in a planned way, and adapt famous literary works from China's "May Fourth" New Literature Movement into film scripts. Currently, adaptations underway include "The True Story of Ah Q" and "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," the latter of which is planned to be filmed as a folk tale.
	The Shanghai Film Script Writing Studio and the Shanghai United Film Studio are making great efforts to produce the above-mentioned historical films, fairy tale films, literary classics, and short story films because the above-mentioned types of films will become an important part of the national film production plan. Now, the main task facing the creative comrades of the studio and the Shanghai United Film Studio is to fully recognize the importance and necessity of creating the above films and to complete the creative tasks assigned to them by the state well.
	The Shanghai Film Script Writing Studio is a business unit under the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Culture. Prior to this, Shanghai had a unit specializing in writing film scripts: the Film Literature Research Institute. As recently pointed out by the Literary Gazette, the Shanghai Film Literature Research Institute had mistakenly adopted the Hollywood-style creative methods of American imperialism, completely disregarding the ideological transformation and life experience of the screenwriters; as a result, it produced a series of film scripts with serious errors, spreading bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas. Now, the Shanghai Film Script Writing Studio is a completely different organization from the Film Literature Research Institute. Currently, some of its staff are actively participating in the anti-theft struggle that is unfolding in Shanghai.
	▲ In the drought prevention and anti-drought campaign in the Fifth District of Funing County, Hebei Province, people were sent to bring radios to the villages, organizing farmers to listen on a rotating basis, which effectively promoted the drought prevention and anti-drought campaign in the district.
	The radio is an effective propaganda tool, and farmers like it very much. Every time they arrive at a village, the masses ask the staff to stay and listen for a while longer. The content of the listening this time mainly explained the principle of "man will conquer nature," pointing out that the idea of "relying on heaven for rain" is wrong. During the listening, the masses deeply felt the care of the People's Government for them. Some people said: "In the countryside, radios could only be enjoyed by landlords in the past. Now, the People's Government sends people to bring them to our mountain villages to listen to, which is the result of Chairman Mao's leadership."
	▲ The Chinese version of "World Youth" No. 3, 1952, was published on March 17th. The content of this issue includes an editorial entitled "World Youth Week - A Festival for Youth to Strive for Peace and Defend the Right to Life." The editorial pointed out: World Youth Week has become a traditional festival in the world democratic youth movement. During this week, young people all over the world firmly express their desire to maintain peace and strive for a better life; this year, in commemorating World Youth Week, young people should enthusiastically demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, protest against the United States rearming Japan and West Germany, oppose the United States' aggression against Korea, and firmly demand disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The article "Great Cultural Anniversary" briefly and concisely introduced the life and deeds of four cultural giants, Hugo, Vinci, Gogol, and Avicenna, and explained the great significance of commemorating them. The article "The Development of Higher Education in the Soviet Kyrgyz Republic" forcefully illustrates the great progress and general situation of the Kyrgyz Republic's education under the leadership of the Soviet government.
	In addition, this issue also contains articles such as "Japanese Youth Actively Acting in the Struggle for National Independence" and "Oppose Discrimination Against Black Athletes."

    ▲上海电影剧本创作所已于三月十三日成立。由夏衍、柯灵分任正副所长。该所创作的电影剧本，专供新近成立的上海联合制片厂摄制。
    上海电影剧本创作所成立后，一面将组织其编剧人员深入劳动人民，深入工人群众中去，在参加实际斗争中改造自己，创作现代题材的电影剧本。同时，该所也将组织大批创作力量，有计划地编写历史题材的电影剧本、童话片剧本、小型故事片剧本，并改编我国“五四”新文学运动以来的文学名著为电影剧本。近已着手改编的，有“阿Q正传”、“梁山伯和祝英台”，后者拟作为民间故事来拍摄。
    上海电影剧本创作所和上海联合电影制片厂，以大力来从事拍摄上述历史片、童话片、文学名著和小型故事片，是因为上述各种类型的片种，将成为国家整个制片计划中的重要组成部分。现在，放在该创作所和上海联合制片厂创作同志们面前的主要任务，乃在于充分地认识创作以上影片的重要性和必要性，把国家交给他们的创作任务很好地完成。
    上海电影剧本创作所是属于上海市人民政府文化局的一个业务单位。在此以前，上海有过一个专门创作电影剧本的单位：那就是电影文学研究所。正如最近文艺报所指出的，上海电影文学研究所曾经错误地采用了美帝国主义好莱坞式的创作方法，完全漠视了编剧者的思想改造和生活体验；其结果，就是制造出一连串犯有严重错误的，散布资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的电影剧本。现在，上海电影剧本创作所是和电影文学研究所完全不同的组织。目前它正以一部分人员积极地去参加正在上海展开的反盗窃斗争。
    ▲河北省抚宁县第五区在防旱抗旱运动中，派人把收音机送到乡村里，巡回组织农民群众收听，有力地推动了该区的防旱抗旱运动。
    收音机是一种有效的宣传工具，农民非常喜欢它。每到一村，群众都挽留工作人员，要求多收听
    一会。这次收听的内容，主要是解释“人定胜天”的道理，指出“靠天等雨”的思想是不对的。在收听中，群众深深地感觉到人民政府对他们的关心，有人说：“在乡下，收音机早先只有地主才可以享用，现在人民政府派人把它送到山村里来给我们收听，这是毛主席领导的结果。”
    ▲“世界青年”中文版一九五二年第三号已于三月十七日出版。这一期的内容：有题为“世界青年周——青年争取和平、保卫生活权利的节日”的社论。社论指出：世界青年周已经成为世界民主青年运动中的一个传统节日，全世界青年在这一周里都坚决表示他们维护和平和争取美好生活的愿望；今年纪念世界青年周，青年们应该热烈要求五大国缔结和平公约、抗议美国重新武装日本和西德，反对美国侵略朝鲜和坚决要求裁减军备和禁用原子武器。“伟大的文化纪念日”一文，简单而扼要地介绍了雨果、芬奇、果戈理、阿维森纳等四位文化巨匠的生平事迹，和阐释了纪念他们的伟大意义。“苏联吉尔吉斯共和国高等教育的发展”一文，有力地说明了吉尔吉斯共和国的教育事业在苏联政府领导下的伟大进展及其概况。
    此外本期还载有“在争取祖国独立斗争中积极行动起来的日本青年”和“反对歧视黑人运动员”等文章。
