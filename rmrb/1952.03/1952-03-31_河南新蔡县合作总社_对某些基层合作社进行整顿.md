    Henan Xincai County Cooperative Federation
    Rectifies Certain Grassroots Cooperatives
    Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 11 published a letter from Ma Buyun, pointing out that some grassroots cooperatives in our county had chaotic operations and serious corruption and theft. After our investigation, we feel that the chaotic phenomena in the business and financial aspects of the grassroots cooperatives are indeed very serious. The serious bureaucratic style of our county cooperative federation is the main reason for this phenomenon. We usually abandon the necessary leadership over the grassroots cooperatives and do not conduct in-depth inspections of the work. When problems arise, we do not promptly find ways to deal with them, causing the work of the grassroots cooperatives to fall into a state of laissez-faire, resulting in the phenomenon of "everyone selling goods, everyone managing money, and accounts are all based on conscience," giving some lawless elements an opportunity to exploit. The Songgang branch of Guan Jin Cooperative and the branch of Zhangzhai Cooperative have successively experienced the theft of public funds and goods. The criticism of Comrade Ma Buyun has given us a great education, making us realize the serious harm of bureaucracy to our work. We have already worked out specific methods for rectifying the grassroots cooperatives, and we are now continuing to carry out the rectification and clearing up of the grassroots cooperatives.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    河南新蔡县合作总社
    对某些基层合作社进行整顿
    编辑同志：一月十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了马步云的来信，指出我县某些基层合作社业务混乱，有严重的贪污、偷盗等现象。我们调查后，觉得各基层社在业务上和财务上混乱的现象确是很严重的。我们县社工作上的严重的官僚主义作风，是造成这种现象的主要原因。我们平日对基层社放弃应有的领导，不深入检查工作，等到问题发生后，又没有及时设法处理，致使各基层社工作陷于自流状态，发生了“人人卖货，个个管钱，账都是良心账”的现象，给一些不法分子钻了空子。关津合作社宋岗门市部和张寨合作社门市部并且先后发生过公款、货物被盗的事情。读者马步云同志的批评给了我们很大教育，使我们认识到官僚主义对工作的严重危害性。我们已经研究出具体整顿基层社的办法，现在正继续作整顿和清理基层社的工作。
    河南新蔡县合作总社
