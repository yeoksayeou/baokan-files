Party Life

    After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the agricultural production instructions, the Party committees of various provinces and special districts have begun to pay attention to them. While thoroughly striving for the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, they have strengthened the work of leading agricultural production. Many regions have issued spring plowing production instructions, started production inspections, and begun to organize spring plowing production propaganda activities. These are necessary measures to promote the spring plowing production movement. These regions should resolutely carry out the established policy and universally launch the spring plowing production movement. In addition, some regions have not yet put production work on the agenda of the leading organs, which must be changed immediately.

    I. Party Organizations Below the County Level Must Resolutely Implement the Policy of Fully Leading Production

    At present, the Party committees of various provinces and regions have made specific arrangements for spring plowing and drought prevention work in accordance with the instructions of the Government Administration Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and most of the spring plowing production offices have been established. The serious problem currently existing is that although many regions have office organizations, they are nominally so as there is no one specifically in charge, nor is there a dedicated institution to lead them. This situation has been found in various places and needs to be resolved urgently. In many areas, county-level cadres are still concentrating their efforts on fighting tigers, without reducing their efforts to turn to leading spring plowing. Some have proposed "fighting tigers on one hand and leading production on the other," which is not suitable for the principle of production being the overriding center below the county level. Why is there a phenomenon of neglecting production in these areas? According to reports from various places, the main reason is that many leading cadres believe that "fighting tigers cannot be put aside," "spring plowing issues are simple, and fighting tigers issues are complex and require leadership," and "the masses will naturally take care of spring plowing when the time comes, and it is enough to send a few people to inspect the work." This kind of thinking is a major obstacle to production leadership. These leading cadres have not seriously studied the central government's instructions on production and drought prevention, and therefore have not made up their minds to shift all their strength or focus of work to leading production. Now that the spring plowing season has arrived, various urgent problems in production have been raised from all sides, and these urgent problems sharply prove how serious a mistake it is to abandon production leadership. According to reports: Some county-level leading cadres in Fujian Province are concentrating on the "Three-Anti" movement and relaxing their leadership over production. For example, at the joint meeting of district Party secretaries and district heads held in Gutian County on March 1, no arrangements or solutions were proposed for the urgent problems to be solved, such as afforestation, famine preparation, seeds, water conservancy, spring famine rations (more than 600,000 catties of grain shortage in 60 townships), pig plague, and cultivation on behalf of revolutionary martyrs' families. Water conservancy projects in the province are also at a standstill. Banks and water conservancy departments have not tightly grasped the spring repair work. Of the original 4.5 billion yuan in water conservancy loans planned for the second half of 1951, only more than 2 billion yuan has been loaned out, affecting the construction of water conservancy projects. There are still nine large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in the province that have not been completed. The fertilizer supply problem has not been completely resolved, and the fertilizers needed by sixteen remote counties cannot be supplied in time. The above-mentioned situation exists not only in Fujian Province, but also in other places. The Party's leading organs should immediately conduct inspections of this situation and earnestly solve it. The Northeast has organized a large number of cadres to go to various places to inspect the preparation for plowing. Other places can follow suit. At present, all rural work must revolve around spring plowing work. Party organizations should pay attention to correcting all phenomena that may relax leadership over production, criticize the "laissez-faire theory" of abandoning production leadership, correctly supervise and organize all forces to implement the Government Administration Council's instructions on production and drought prevention, and check whether the leadership of spring plowing production in various places has been grasped tightly, whether the production office is already leading production work in an organized and planned manner, and whether the office has enough cadres working. If the cadre problem has not been resolved, we should boldly promote activists among the masses or supplement some necessary manpower from higher levels. At the same time, we must check the main problems and difficulties in the masses' production, such as in the area south of the Huai River, where there has been more rain and snow this year, and some wheat fields have accumulated water, so we must take measures to prevent and control it in time, and carefully check and repair flood prevention projects. In the Southwest region, it has not rained for a long time, and drought has already formed in some areas, reducing wheat production. If it does not rain again, the problem will be even more serious. These drought-stricken areas should carefully check and do a good job in drought prevention and drought resistance. All rural areas should also check whether fertilizers and farm tools have been fully prepared and can meet the needs of farmers, whether cooperatives can supply them on time, whether seeds have been fully adjusted, whether insecticides and machinery have been fully prepared, and whether there are comprehensive solutions for disaster relief and sideline production in spring famine areas. Has the work of purchasing local products in rural areas in various places been restored? For the above-mentioned problems, the Party's leading organs must put forward solutions based on the overall situation and solve them. This is the most decisive work to complete the Government Administration Council's and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on production and drought prevention, and to strive for a bumper harvest this year.

    II. Propaganda Workers of Rural Party Organizations Should Launch Large-Scale Production Propaganda Activities

    In accordance with the agricultural production policies stipulated by the Central Committee and the specific plans put forward by the Party's leading organs and the people's governments in various regions to implement this policy, Party propaganda workers should take themselves as the center of activity, organize all forces, and launch large-scale propaganda activities. Attention should be paid to the following aspects during propaganda: 1. Loudly put forward the slogan "Strive for a Bumper Harvest This Year" to cadres, Party members, and the broad masses, and explain that in order to achieve a national bumper harvest, it is necessary to increase the unit area yield of agricultural production. At present, the most urgent work to increase farmland yield is to vigorously accumulate fertilizer, especially pig manure, which is the most beneficial. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to enthusiastically respond to the slogan put forward by the Government Administration Council of "Every family raises pigs, builds pens, and accumulates fertilizer." 2. Build small water conservancy projects and establish small reservoirs and pools to ensure timely irrigation and long-term struggle against natural disasters such as drought, flood, and insect pests. 3. Widely introduce the model farms, mutual aid groups, and bumper harvest models of 1951 released by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Committee to the masses, and introduce their achievements in production and political advantages. When publicizing these model examples, we must especially publicize the typical experience of improving production by organized methods, and introduce the excellent achievements of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. 4. Use the materials about state-owned farms that have been published in newspapers to conduct appropriate socialist perspective education for cadres, Party members, and farmers, and explain to Party members and farmers the vivid fact that state-owned farms use workers' production methods to carry out agricultural production, which can greatly increase production. Tell them: State-owned farms and collective farms are the future happy prospects for farmers across the country. Combining such vivid examples to carry out socialist education for rural Party members and farmers can greatly improve the farmers' horizons, break various doubts, and enhance their confidence in production; at the same time, it can also correct the selfish ideas of "production has reached the top," "burying one's head in getting rich," "fear of mutual aid and no freedom," and "successful revolution, self-sufficiency" among some rural Party members, cadres, and some of the masses, and inspire farmers' enthusiasm for organizing production. 5. In response to the various specific issues that urgently need to be resolved in the minds of cadres, Party members, and farmers, combine the instructions of higher authorities to carry out propaganda, such as explaining the "Three-Anti" policy to address the ideological concerns of some cadres about the "Three-Anti" movement, and calling on those with unclean hands and feet to atone for their crimes and make meritorious deeds; for those who do not have a clear understanding of the "Three-Anti" movement, it is necessary to call on them to eliminate doubts and work hard. For example, in response to the idea of "fear of eating from the big pot" among some of the masses in the land reform areas, correctly explain the policy of agricultural production, and explain that the Party's policy is to support farmers' production and highly promote farmers' enthusiasm for production. In addition to calling on the organization to carry out production in the land reform areas, we should also encourage the production enthusiasm of individual farmers, and on the basis of gradually raising their awareness, enlighten and improve their interest in organizing.

    Propaganda workers should promote all propaganda forces in rural areas (such as blackboards, mass propaganda teams, people's schools, reading groups, night schools, etc.) to carry out huge propaganda activities, but the propaganda methods must be very flexible, not delaying agricultural time, and not holding too many meetings, so as not to hinder agricultural production activities.

    Party organizations should strengthen the leadership of propaganda workers. When carrying out propaganda, every propaganda worker should prevent the method of simply motivating the masses from economic interests, and pay attention not to repeat the capitalist tendencies in past propaganda, such as the error of publicizing "planting cotton to get rich." We must combine the propaganda of agricultural production with the mobilization of patriotism, correctly explain the consistency between loving the country and doing a good job in production, make farmers across the country realize the country's care for farmers, and mobilize farmers to engage in production with patriotic enthusiasm. At the same time, through ideological education, farmers should understand the direction of rural economic development, call on farmers to organize, follow the Communist Party, and create a happy and prosperous life with their own hands. Party propaganda workers should carry out patient propaganda work, improve the ideological awareness of farmers, and fight to complete the Party's and the People's Government's call for agricultural production this year.

    III. Win Over and Unite Senior Staff

    After ordinary shop employees and workers actively take action, illegal capitalists will be forced to confess their problems. However, if the senior staff who know the most about the capitalist's illegal activities have not been won over, some fortresses will still be difficult to completely destroy. Therefore, the inspection team should vigorously win over and unite senior staff such as accountants and runners. Some of these people are relatives and friends of capitalists, have some shares in factories or shops, some have been instructed by capitalists to do illegal things, and some have even bullied workers by taking advantage of their power. Therefore, they are afraid of returning stolen goods and being punished by law, and doubt whether the working class still wants them. When encountering such a situation, the inspection team should patiently point out to them that only by explaining the problem clearly and reporting meritorious service can the People's Government not pursue it, and they can also return to the working class team with unlimited bright prospects. To improve their awareness, one of the most effective ways is to settle accounts with them in detail, and use concrete facts to illustrate the result of their being used by capitalists to do illegal things, which is to fatten the capitalists, while they themselves have gained little, but have been stained with mud; if they do not wake up quickly, they will really be implicated by the capitalists and ruin their future. Wang Shidang, the accountant of Dahua Mineral Oil Factory, who was bought by unscrupulous merchants, was awakened by this method of settling accounts in detail, and as a result, he exposed more than 40 problems such as tax evasion, theft of state property, and harboring counter-revolutionaries by the factory's capital at the accusation meeting.

    After the senior staff are won over, in order to strengthen the unity within the staff, the inspection team should convene a "unity meeting," "criticism meeting," or "return meeting" of all staff to welcome the awakened class brothers back to the team. At the meeting, staff who have made serious mistakes should make self-criticisms, and everyone should also conduct strict criticisms on them, and express the hope that they will be determined to correct their mistakes. This kind of meeting full of class friendship often deeply moves the staff who have made mistakes and strengthens their determination to fight the illegal capitalists to the end. After the angry exposure and denunciation by all the staff, the illegal capitalists will generally be forced to confess their problems. Although some illegal capitalists are still unwilling to confess frankly, with the help of all the staff, the inspection team quickly found out all their illegal activities.

### 党组织必须加强对农业生产的领导

    党组织必须加强对农业生产的领导
    中共中央和中央人民政府政务院发布农业生产指示后，各省和各专区地区党委都已开始加以注意，在彻底争取“三反”和“五反”运动胜利的同时，加强领导农业生产的工作。很多地区发布了春耕生产指示，着手进行了生产检查，并开始组织了春耕生产的宣传活动，这是推动春耕生产运动的必要措施。这些地区应当坚决按照既定方针把春耕生产运动普遍开展起来。另外有些地区现在还没有把生产工作提到领导机关的议事日程上，这是必须立即改变的。
    一、县以下党的组织必须坚决贯彻全力领导生产的方针
    现在各省、区党委对春耕、防旱工作都按照政务院和党中央的指示作了具体布置，春耕生产办公室大部已建立，目前存在的严重问题是许多地区虽有办公室组织，但因无专人负责，也没有专门机构来领导，结果形同虚设，这种情况在各地都有发现，急需解决。有不少地区县级干部仍在集中力量打虎，而没有收缩力量转入领导春耕，有的提出“一面打虎，一面领导生产”，这都是不适合于县以下以生产为压倒一切中心的原则的。为什么这些地区有着忽视生产的现象呢？据各地反映，主要是很多领导干部认为“打虎放不下手”，“春耕问题简单，打虎问题复杂需要领导”，“春耕到时群众自然会搞起来，抽个把人检查一下工作就可以了”。这种思想是目前生产领导的重大障碍。这些领导干部没有认真研究中央关于生产防旱的指示，因而没有下决心把全副力量或工作重心转向领导生产。现在，春耕季节已到，生产上的各种迫切问题已经从各个方面被提出来了，这些迫切的问题尖锐地证明放弃生产领导是多么严重的错误。据反映：福建有些县领导干部集中精力搞“三反”，放松对生产的领导。如古田县在三月一日召开的区委书记、区长联席会议上对急待解决的造林、备荒、种籽、水利、春荒口粮（六十个乡缺粮六十万斤以上）、猪瘟、烈军属代耕等问题，都没有布置和提出解决办法。该省水利工程也在停顿中，银行和水利部门对春修工作抓的不紧，原定一九五一年下半年的四十五亿元水利贷款，现只贷出二十多亿，影响水利工程的兴修，该省较大的中型水利工程尚有九处未完工。肥料供应问题尚没有完全解决，十六个僻偏县份所需肥料不能及时供应。以上这些情况，不仅福建省有，其他各地也都有。党的领导机关对于这种情况应即进行检查，认真加以解决。东北已组织大批干部分赴各地检查备耕工作，各地可以仿行。当前农村一切工作都必须围绕着春耕工作来进行。党的组织应当注意纠正一切可能放松领导生产的现象，批评放弃生产领导的“自流论”，正确地监督并组织一切力量执行政务院的生产防旱指示，检查各地对春耕生产的领导工作是否抓紧，生产办公室是否已经有组织有计划地在领导生产工作，办公室是否有着足够的干部在工作。如果干部问题没有解决，就应大胆提拔群众中的积极分子，或由上级补充一些必要的人力。同时要检查群众生产中的主要问题和困难，如淮河流域以南，今年雨雪较大，部分麦田已有积水，就要及时设法防治，并认真检查和修治防涝工程。西南地区天久不雨，有的地区旱象已成，小麦减收，如果再不下雨，问题将更严重，这些干旱地区应当认真检查并做好防旱抗旱的工作。所有农村又都应该检查肥料、农具是否已经准备充分，能否满足农民的需要，合作社是否能做到按时供应？种籽是否充分地作了调剂？治虫药械是否作了充分准备？春荒地区的灾民口粮、副业生产等是否有了通盘解决的办法？各地农村土产收购工作是否已经恢复？对于以上这些问题，党的领导机关要依据全面情况提出办法，加以解决，这是为完成政务院和党中央关于生产防旱指示，争取今年丰收的最有决定意义的工作。
    二、农村党组织的宣传员要开展大规模的生产宣传活动
    按照中央所规定的农业生产方针和各地区党的领导机关、人民政府为贯彻这个方针而提出的具体计划，党的宣传员应当以自己为活动中心，组织一切力量，展开大规模的宣传活动。宣传时应当注意以下几个方面：一、响亮地向干部、党员和广大群众提出“争取今年丰收”的口号，说明为了实现全国丰收，就必须提高农业生产的单位面积产量。目前提高农田产量最紧迫的工作是大力积肥，肥料中特别是以积猪肥最为有利，要动员群众热烈响应政务院提出的“家家养猪，修圈积肥”的口号。二、兴修小型水利，建立小型水库水池，保证及时灌溉，长期地同旱灾和水灾虫灾等自然灾害进行斗争。三、广泛介绍中央农业部发布的一九五一年的模范农场、互助组和丰产模范，向群众介绍他们生产上的成就和政治上的优越性。在宣传这些模范例子时，特别要宣传其中的用组织起来的办法提高生产的典型经验，介绍农业生产合作社、互助组的优良成绩。四、利用报纸上已发表的关于国营农场的材料向干部、党员、农民进行适当的社会主义远景的教育，向党员和农民说明国营农场用工人生产的办法来进行农业生产，可以大大提高生产量的生动事实。告诉他们：国营农场和集体农场是全国农民的未来的幸福的远景。结合这样生动事例进行对农村党员和农民的社会主义教育，就可以大大提高农民的眼界，打破各种疑虑，增强生产的信心；同时也可以纠正某些农村党员、干部和部分群众中的“生产到顶”，“埋头发家”，“怕互助不自由”，“革命成功，自耕自足”等等自私自利的思想，启发农民组织起来生产的积极性。五、针对干部、党员和农民思想中各种迫切需要解决的具体问题，结合上级指示进行宣传，如针对某些干部对“三反”运动的思想顾虑，解释“三反”政策，号召手脚不干净的人戴罪立功；对“三反”运动认识不清的人，要号召他们消除疑虑努力工作。又如针对土地改革地区部分群众中“怕吃大锅饭”思想，正确地解释农业生产的政策，说明党的政策是要扶助农民生产，高度发扬农民的生产积极性。在土地改革地区除号召组织起来进行生产以外，还应鼓励单干农民的生产积极性，在逐步提高他们的觉悟的基础上，启发和提高他们对组织起来的兴趣。
    宣传员要推动农村一切宣传力量（如黑板报、群众宣传队、民校、读报组、夜校等）进行巨大的宣传活动，但宣传方式必须是十分灵活，不能耽误农时，不可开会过多，以免妨碍农业生产活动。
    党的组织要加强对宣传员的领导。每一个宣传员在进行宣传时，都要防止单纯从经济利益去鼓动群众的办法，注意不要重复过去宣传中的资本主义倾向，如宣传“要发家种棉花”等的错误。一定要把农业生产的宣传同爱国主义的动员结合起来，正确解释爱国家同搞好生产的一致性，使全国农民认识国家对农民的关怀，动员农民以爱国主义热情从事生产。同时经过思想教育，使农民懂得农村经济发展的方向，号召农民组织起来，跟着共产党走，用自己的双手创造美满富裕的生活。党的宣传员应当进行耐心的宣传工作，提高农民的思想觉悟，为完成党和人民政府关于今年农业生产的号召而斗争。三、争取和团结高级职员
    一般店员工人积极行动起来后，违法资本家会被迫交代问题。但如果了解资本家违法事实最多的高级职员尚未争取过来，有的堡垒仍然难于全部摧毁。因此检查组应大力争取和团结会计、跑外等高级职员。这些人，有的是资本家的亲戚朋友，在工厂或商店中有一些股，有的是曾受资本家的指使，干过违法的事，有的还仗势欺压过工人。因此他们害怕退赃、法办，怀疑工人阶级是否还要他们。遇到这样的情况，检查组应耐心地给他们指明，只有把问题交代清楚，并检举立功，人民政府可以不追究，还可以回到前途无限光明的工人阶级队伍中来。为了提高他们的觉悟，最有效的方式之一是和他们算细账，用具体的事实说明他们被资本家利用来干违法事情的结果，是养肥了资本家，而他们自己却所得不多，反而染上了一身污泥；如果还不赶快醒悟，那就真要受资本家的连累，断送自己的前途了。被奸商收买的大华矿油厂的会计王世堂，就是通过这种算细账的方法使他恍然大悟的，结果他在控诉会上检举了该厂资方漏税、盗窃国家资财和包庇反革命分子等四十多个问题。
    在高级职员被争取过来以后，为了加强职工内部的团结，检查组应召开全体职工的“团结会”“批评会”或“归队会”，欢迎觉悟了的阶级兄弟归队。在会上，曾经犯过严重错误的职员应作检讨，大家也应向他们进行严格的批评，并表示希望他们决心改正错误。这种充满阶级友情的会议，常常使犯过错误的职员深受感动，坚定了和违法资本家斗争到底的决心。违法资本家经过全体职工愤怒的检举揭发，一般就会被迫交代问题。有些违法资本家虽然仍是不肯坦白，但在全体职工的协助下，检查组也迅速查清了他们的一切违法行为。
