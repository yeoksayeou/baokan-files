Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: Women from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a grand rally on the evening of the 7th to celebrate International Women's Day. The rally was attended by over a thousand people, including responsible individuals from the Central Committee and various levels of organizations of the Korean Democratic Women's League, prominent female Heroes of the Republic, female Labor Heroes, female model combatants of the People's Army, female guerrilla fighters, female model workers, and female model farmers from the Pyongyang area. Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Vice Premier of the Cabinet Heo Ga-i, Vice Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Tal-hyeon, Lee Young and other heads of the Republic's government, as well as responsible individuals from democratic parties and social organizations led by the Korean Workers' Party, personally attended. Representatives from the embassies and organizations of the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries in Korea, as well as the women's delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, were also invited to participate in the rally.

Amid thunderous applause, all attendees unanimously elected General Kim Il-sung, Marshal Stalin, Chairman Mao Zedong, and leaders of the People's Democratic countries, along with Madame Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and Frédéric Joliot-Curie, President of the World Peace Council, as honorary chairpersons of the rally. Following this, a Pyongyang children's congratulatory delegation marched into the venue to the sound of military music, extending warm congratulations to the mothers.

Park Jeong-ae, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League, delivered a commemorative report to the rally. She emphasized that the heroism and patriotism displayed by Korean women in the anti-aggression war, as well as the labor achievements they have already established and are continuing to establish, not only strengthened the connection between the front and the rear but also served as an important factor in ensuring victory on the front lines. She then said that the strong support of international democratic women for Korean women has infinitely inspired the confidence of Korean women in smashing the aggressive crimes of the American bandits. Park Jeong-ae called on all Korean women to unite more closely around the leader of the Korean people, General Kim Il-sung, and dedicate all their strength to win the final victory in the Fatherland Liberation War.

Women representatives from the Chinese, Hungarian, and Romanian embassies in Korea delivered congratulatory speeches in succession. The congratulatory messages from the Soviet women's delegation and the women's delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Pyongyang were also read at the meeting.

The congratulatory message from the women's delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers stated: Our two peoples, China and Korea, have forged an unbreakable friendship in the common struggle against American aggression, and the unity and friendship between the women of our two countries have been further consolidated and strengthened in the struggle. This noble friendship and unity are a reliable guarantee for us to achieve greater victories in the future. Korean women have already made great contributions in the anti-aggression war. The heroic spirit they have shown in defending peace has set an outstanding example in the international democratic women's struggle to defend peace. The congratulatory message said: The female comrades in the Chinese People's Volunteers, entrusted by the Chinese people, have come to fight alongside the Korean sisters against the American aggressors. It is the most glorious task of our lives to be able to participate in this struggle to resist America and aid Korea. We have resolutely and bravely overcome all the difficulties imposed on us by the enemy and completed various arduous tasks. More than 500 female comrades in our army have gloriously rendered meritorious service. The congratulatory message concluded: We have already achieved great victories, and we must move from victory to victory! Dear Korean sisters, let us unite more closely, fight more bravely and resolutely to defend peace!

The rally unanimously adopted a telegram of respect to General Kim Il-sung, Marshal Stalin, and Chairman Mao Zedong.
