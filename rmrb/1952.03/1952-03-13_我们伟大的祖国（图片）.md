    Our Great Motherland
    Twenty-five miles south of Luoyang City in Henan Province lies the famous "Yique" at the Dragon Gate, where the Yi River flows. On the stone cliffs facing each other on both sides of the river, there are countless stone Buddhas carved by our working people more than 1,400 years ago. This place and Luoyang City were liberated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army on this day four years ago.
