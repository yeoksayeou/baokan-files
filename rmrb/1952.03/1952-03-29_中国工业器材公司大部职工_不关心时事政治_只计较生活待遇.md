    Most Employees of the China Industrial Equipment Company
    Do Not Care About Current Affairs and Politics, Only Focus on Living Standards
    Editor: The People's Daily's reader's letters column on March 22nd criticized medical workers for not paying attention to reading newspapers and studying. This situation also seriously exists among our trade workers. Taking the China Industrial Equipment Company as an example: among more than two hundred people, very few read the newspaper relatively carefully, most people just glance at the headlines very hastily, or don't read the newspaper at all. This situation makes it impossible for the vast majority of cadres to receive education from the Party newspaper, and of course, they cannot work according to the guidance of the Party newspaper. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the situation of staff not reading newspapers is even more serious. Many people are busy fighting "tigers," emphasizing that they do not have time to read newspapers. Since these comrades do not read the newspaper, how can they profoundly recognize the great significance of the "Three-Anti" movement ideologically and politically? And how can they carry out the movement according to the instructions of the Central Committee? Some comrades also know about the "frenzied attacks of the bourgeoisie," but they only heard the leaders report this at the anti-corruption meetings. As for what its meaning is, many people cannot say. In this way, in the great "Three-Anti" movement, many people have not yet ideologically drawn a line between themselves and the bourgeoisie.
    Because most people do not care about national affairs, they haggle over their living standards and salaries. What a terrible tendency this is! It is hoped that the leadership and the trade union organization will pay attention to this issue and solve it immediately.    Jia Hua

### 中国工业器材公司大部职工  不关心时事政治  只计较生活待遇

    中国工业器材公司大部职工
    不关心时事政治  只计较生活待遇
    编辑同志：三月二十二日人民日报读者来信栏批评了医务工作者不重视读报学习的情况。这种情况在我们贸易工作者中间也是严重存在的。以中国工业器材公司为例：二百多人中间，比较认真读报的人为数很少，极大部分人只是十分潦草地看一看大标题，或者根本不看报。这种情况使得绝大部分干部不能从党报上获得教育，当然就不能按照党报的指导来作工作了。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，工作人员不看报纸的情况是更严重了。许多人忙于打“老虎”，强调自己没有时间读报。这些同志既然不看报，怎样能够从思想上、政治上深刻地认清“三反”运动的重大意义呢？又怎样能够根据中央的指示来开展运动呢？有些同志虽然也知道“资产阶级的猖狂进攻”这些话，但这都是在开反贪污大会时听首长们报告的，至于它的意义是什么，许多人就说不出来。这样，在伟大的“三反”运动中，许多人就还没有从思想上和资产阶级划清界限。
    由于大部分人不关心国家大事，他们就斤斤计较自己的生活待遇、薪金，这是一种多么恶劣的倾向！希望领导方面和工会组织重视这一问题，立即加以解决。    家骅
