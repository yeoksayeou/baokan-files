    Instructions from the CCP Central Committee to Party Committees at All Levels on the Issue of Preventing Forest Fires

    Forest fires occur frequently in our country, causing immense damage to vast areas of forests in various regions. This not only severely damages the source of timber, making the timber needed for national economic construction even more scarce, but also invites various agricultural disasters such as waterlogging, drought, wind, sandstorms, and hail. In order to guarantee the needs of our country's industrial construction and agricultural production, existing forests must be effectively protected to prevent them from continuing to be destroyed. The CCP Central Committee fully agrees with the instructions on strictly preventing forest fires issued by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. All levels of local Party committees in areas with mountains and forests, especially the Northeast and Inner Mongolia Party committees, must seriously discuss and ensure its thorough implementation. At the same time, they should be responsible for leading and督促 (du cu = urge and supervise) Party organizations of local people's governments at all levels, and educating all Party members, Youth League members, as well as members of farmers' associations and women's federations, to deeply mobilize the masses and work hard to protect forests and prevent fires.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, March 4, 1952

    关于防止森林火灾问题
    中共中央给各级党委的指示
    我国森林因经常发生火灾事件，致各地广大面积森林被害甚巨。这不仅严重地损害了木材的来源，使国家经济建设所需要的木料更加缺乏，且将招致农业上的水、旱、风、沙、雹等各种灾害。为保障我国工业建设和农业生产的需要，必须把现有森林确实保护好，不使继续遭受破坏。中共中央完全同意中央人民政府政务院所颁布的关于严防森林火灾的指示，凡有山林地区的各级地方党委，尤其东北和内蒙党委，必须认真讨论并保证其彻底执行。同时应负责领导和督促各级地方人民政府党的组织并教育所有党员、团员以及农民协会和妇女联合会的会员，深入地发动群众，努力进行护林防火工作。
    中国共产党中央委员会  一九五二年三月四日
