Right when the people of China and Korea and peace-loving people all over the world are continuously expressing their angry protests against the unreasonable attitude of the American aggressors in the Korean armistice negotiations, and issuing serious warnings and righteous condemnations against the American aggressors' crimes of waging bacteriological warfare in Korea, the extremely vicious American aggressors have no intention of repentance, and dare to continue their frantic struggle, recklessly dispatching the American air force invading Korea to continuously invade our Northeast China from February 29th to March 5th, indiscriminately bombing the Linjiang area, and spreading a large number of insects carrying bacteria in Fushun, Xinmin, Andong and other places. This heinous crime fully proves that the American aggressors are continuing to attempt to realize their sinister plan to expand the war of aggression, and once again make a further crazy provocation to the people of our country and peace-loving people all over the world. Today, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, issued a statement on behalf of our government, lodging a serious protest with the United States government, announcing that any American air force personnel who invade China's airspace and use bacteriological weapons will be treated as war criminals once captured, and declaring that the United States government must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from this crime. This solemn statement of our government fully reflects the infinite anger of our people at the American aggression against Korea, the expansion of the war of aggression, and the crime of conducting bacteriological warfare, as well as our unshakable fighting will.

The facts clearly tell people: the American aggressors' sinister plot to expand the war of aggression is increasing. From the first day of the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, the American aggressors' bloody plan to invade our country, invade the whole of Asia, and invade the whole world has been fully exposed to the people of the world. For the past year and a half, thanks to the voluntary action of the Chinese people to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries and people around the world to defend peace and oppose American aggression, the American aggressors have suffered heavy defeats on the Korean battlefield, and the American aggressors have had to accept the proposal to hold armistice negotiations in Korea. However, during the eight months of negotiations, the American aggressors have tried every means to obstruct the progress of the negotiations and constantly create provocative incidents. These have fully proved that the American aggressors are not giving up their plan to expand the war of aggression. Now the American air force invading Korea is constantly invading our Northeast China and creating so many brutal crimes, which further proves that the American aggressors are blatantly expanding the war of aggression and wantonly undermining the Korean armistice negotiations.

The people of our country will never tolerate the crimes of the American air force invading Korea in infringing upon our Northeast China. People will remember that in September and October of 1950, when the flames of the American war of aggression against Korea were increasingly burning towards our border, the American air force invading Korea had repeatedly invaded our Northeast China dozens of times, indiscriminately bombing and strafing, thus further arousing the angry tide of the Chinese people resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. It was from that time that the great Chinese People's Volunteers appeared in human history; it was also from that time that the American aggressors suffered increasingly heavy blows on the Korean battlefield and were badly battered. The Chinese people's determination to defend their motherland's territorial sovereignty and to fight for peace and against aggression is firm and unwavering, and becomes stronger with tempering. Now the American air force invading Korea is once again indiscriminately bombing and strafing our Northeast China, killing and injuring our people and destroying our houses. This is another crime of the American aggressors violating international law, infringing upon our country's territorial airspace sovereignty, and残害the people of our country. The people of our country have every right to accuse and condemn the American aggressors to the people of the world and demand that their aggressive bloody hands be completely severed.

The people of our country will never tolerate the extremely insane crime of the American air force invading Korea spreading a large number of bacteria-carrying insects in our Northeast China. Since the American aggressors launched a large-scale bacteriological warfare on the Korean battlefield in late January, the people of China and Korea and fair-minded public opinion around the world have unanimously condemned the American aggressors' heinous crime of exterminating humanity. However, the American aggressors, regardless of the serious warnings from righteous mankind, have now expanded this inhuman bacteriological warfare to our Northeast China. The American aggressors have shamelessly denied the fact that they are conducting bacteriological warfare, attempting to shirk their responsibility for this crime. US Secretary of State Acheson issued a shameless statement on the 4th of this month, falsely claiming that "United Nations forces have not conducted and are not conducting any kind of bacteriological warfare." However, no matter how accustomed Acheson or other shameless people are to sophistry, they cannot cover up the bloody traces of a series of planned and prepared bacteriological warfare by the American invading forces. Iron facts prove that the so-called "United Nations forces" not only conducted bacteriological warfare in the past, but are now conducting it on a larger scale, and the American aggressors must bear full responsibility for this bacteriological warfare crime.

Everyone remembers that in the winter of 1950, when the American invading forces were retreating in embarrassment under the strong blows of the Chinese and Korean people's forces, they used bacteriological weapons in the north-south area from Pyongyang to Wonsan; everyone remembers the bloody records of a group of "bacterial experts" directed by Sims, director of the "Public Health Bureau" of the American invading forces headquarters, experimenting with bacteriological weapons on the American bacteriological landing craft No. 1091; everyone also knows the criminal activities carried out by the Japanese fascist bacteriological war criminals such as Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, who were kept by the American aggressors. Acheson and his like dared not mention a word about these facts known to the world. Moreover, the countless pieces of evidence of the American invading forces spreading bacteria on a large scale recently on the positions of the Chinese and Korean people's forces on the Korean front and in the rear areas, and now within our Northeast China, are absolutely undeniable by Acheson and his like.

The people of the world have long seen through that the American aggressors and their government officials are a group of shameless thugs accustomed to lying and denying. People also remember that two months after the outbreak of the American war of aggression against Korea, when Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country, sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council on August 24, 1950, protesting against the American aggression against our territory of Taiwan, US Department of Defense officials also "solemnly declared" that "there are no American military personnel in Taiwan" and that "American naval aircraft and ships have not visited Taiwan," but the fact is that American military personnel and the navy and air force had already occupied Taiwan and its sea areas. Now, the extremely vicious American aggressors thoroughly violate humanity, destroy international conventions, and conduct large-scale bacteriological warfare. The ironclad evidence is like a mountain, not only cannot be denied, but the more they deny it, the more they expose their bloody faces. The people of our country must take practical actions to severely punish the heinous murderers of bacteriological warfare. This is the sacred right that the people of our country must insist on in order to uphold justice and protect the safety of themselves and all mankind.

The reason why the American aggressors want to indiscriminately bomb our Northeast China again at this time, and conduct large-scale bacteriological warfare, is obviously to try to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations, to try to prolong and expand the war of aggression against Korea, and to further provoke a new war. The American aggressors are trying to maintain the war profits of American monopoly capitalists and continue to plunder the manpower and material resources of various vassal states by means of this extremely adventurous struggle. Therefore, a serious test is now placed before the governments of various countries that are servants of the United States. The governments of these countries must express their attitude towards the increasingly serious crimes of the United States in undermining the Korean armistice negotiations, wantonly bombing our Northeast China, spreading bacteria on a large scale, and expanding the war of aggression. Whoever advocates and strives to stop the heinous crimes of the American aggressors will have the opportunity to get rid of the new war trap set by the American aggressors; whoever supports and agrees to these heinous crimes of the American aggressors, or makes excuses to shirk and cover up, will finally prove that he is completely a pawn of the American aggressors, proving that he is as much a deadly enemy of human justice and security as the American aggressors.

The people of our country firmly support the solemn statement of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country. We must severely punish all crimes of the American aggressors, especially the American murderers who use Japanese bacteriological war criminals to slaughter and poison the people of our country, and we must demand repayment of this endless blood debt. The people of our country are not afraid of any provocation by the American aggressors, because we deeply know that the more frantic the enemy is, the more isolated and desperate the enemy is. The great movement of the Chinese people to resist US aggression and aid Korea will advance on a broader scale; the heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese and Korean people will respond to the frantic American aggressors with heavier blows. Peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world will be with us, fighting to the end to stop the heinous crimes of the American aggressors and severely punish the brutal and inhumane American murderers.

    严惩滥炸我东北和撒布细菌的美国凶手
    正当中朝两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，对于美国侵略者在朝鲜停战谈判中蛮横无理的态度不断发出愤怒的抗议，对于美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行发出了严重警告和正义声讨的时候，穷凶极恶的美国侵略者竟然毫无悔祸之心，胆敢继续疯狂挣扎，不顾一切地派遣侵朝的美国空军，自二月二十九日至三月五日，连续侵入我国东北，在临江地区滥施轰炸，并在抚顺、新民、安东等地撒布大量传播细菌的昆虫。这种丧心病狂的滔天罪行，完全证明美国侵略者正在继续企图实现其扩大侵略战争的罪恶计划，再一次向我国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民作进一步的疯狂的挑衅。我国外交部周恩来部长今天代表我国政府发表声明，向美国政府提出了严重抗议，宣布凡属侵入中国领空、使用细菌武器的美国空军人员一经俘获，即行作为战争罪犯处理，并声明由于这种罪行所引起的一切后果，都必须由美国政府负全部的责任。我国政府的这个严正的声明，完全反映了我国人民对于美国扩大侵朝战争和进行细菌战罪行的无限愤怒和我们的不可动摇的战斗意志。
    事实极明显地告诉了人们：美国侵略者扩大侵朝战争的罪恶图谋是有加无已的。从侵朝战争爆发的第一天起，美国侵略者侵略我国、侵略全亚洲、侵略全世界的血腥计划就已经充分地暴露在全世界人民的面前了。一年半以来，由于我国人民抗美援朝的志愿行动，由于全世界爱好和平的国家和人民保卫和平、反对美国侵略的努力，使美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上遭受了惨重的失败，使美国侵略者不能不接受在朝鲜举行停战谈判的建议。但在八个月的谈判中，美国侵略者百般阻挠谈判的进行，不断制造挑衅事件，这些又充分证明了美国侵略者对于扩大侵略战争的计划是并不死心的。现在美国侵朝空军竟又不断侵入我国东北，制造了这许多残暴的罪行，这就更加证明美国侵略者是明目张胆地在扩大侵略战争，肆无忌惮地在破坏朝鲜停战谈判了。
    我国人民对于侵朝的美国空军侵犯我国东北的罪行，是决不能容忍的。人们都会记得，当一九五○年的九、十月间，即美国侵朝战争的火焰日益烧向我国边境的时候，美国侵朝空军就曾连续数十次侵入我国东北，滥施轰炸和扫射，因而更加激起了我国人民抗美援朝的怒潮。正是从那时候开始，伟大的中国人民志愿军就在人类历史上出现了；也正是从那时候开始，美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上就遭受到日益沉重的打击，碰得头破血流了。中国人民为保卫自己祖国的领土主权，为保卫和平反对侵略而斗争的决心是坚定不移的，是愈磨砺而愈坚强的。现在美国侵朝空军竟又向我国东北滥施轰炸和扫射，杀伤和毁坏我国人民的生命和房屋。这是美国侵略者违反国际公法、侵犯我国领土领空主权、残害我国人民的又一罪行，我国人民完全有权向全世界人民控诉和声讨美国侵略者，要求把他们的侵略血手完全斩断。
    我国人民对于侵朝的美国空军向我东北大量撒布传播细菌昆虫的绝顶疯狂的罪行，更是决不能容忍的。自从一月下旬美国侵略者在朝鲜战场上进行大规模的细菌战以来，中朝两国人民和全世界公正舆论，都一致愤怒声讨美国侵略者的这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行。然而美国侵略者竟不顾正义人类的严重警告，现在又把这种惨无人道的细菌战扩大到我国东北地区来了。美国侵略者曾无耻地否认他们进行细菌战的事实，企图推卸他们对这种罪行所应负的责任。美国国务卿艾奇逊于本月四日曾发表无耻声明，胡说“联合国军过去未进行现在也未进行任何种细菌战”。但是，不论是艾奇逊或是别的什么无耻之徒怎样惯于狡赖，也不能掩盖美国侵略军有计划、有准备地进行细菌战的一连串血腥的罪迹。铁的事实证明，所谓“联合国军”不但过去进行了而且现在更大规模地进行着细菌战，而美国侵略者则必须对这种细菌战罪行负完全责任。
    谁都记得一九五零年的冬季，当美国侵略军在中朝人民部队坚强的打击下狼狈败退的时候，就曾在平壤到元山一线的南北地区使用了细菌武器；谁都记得美国侵略军总部“公共卫生局”局长赛姆斯所指挥的一群“细菌专家”，在美国一零九一号细菌登陆艇上试验细菌武器的血腥记载；谁也晓得美国侵略者豢养着石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等日本法西斯细菌战犯所进行的罪恶活动。艾奇逊之流对于这些举世周知的事实是一字也不敢提的。而美国侵略军最近在朝鲜前线中朝人民部队的阵地及后方地区和现在对我国东北境内，大规模撒布细菌的无数罪证，更是艾奇逊之流所绝对抵赖不了的。
    全世界人民都早已看透了美国侵略者及其政府官员是一群毫不知羞耻的惯于撒谎抵赖的暴徒。人们还记得在美国侵朝战争爆发两个月之后，当我国外交部周恩来部长于一九五零年八月二十四日致电联合国安全理事会抗议美国侵略我国领土台湾的时候，美国国防部官员也曾“郑重声明”，说“台湾并无美国军事人员”，“美国海军飞机及船舰并未访问台湾”，然而事实是美国的军事人员和海军、空军早已侵占了台湾及其海面。现在穷凶极恶的美国侵略者彻底违反人道，破坏国际公约，进行大规模细菌战，铁证如山，不但抵赖不了，而且他们愈抵赖就只能愈加暴露他们的血腥嘴脸。我国人民对于万恶的细菌战凶手，一定要采取实际行动予以严惩，这是我国人民为了伸张正义、为了保障自己和全人类安全所必须坚持的神圣权利。
    美国侵略者之所以要在这个时候再次向我国东北滥施轰炸，并且进行大规模的细菌战，其目的显然是企图破坏朝鲜停战谈判，是企图延长和扩大侵略朝鲜的战争，并进一步挑拨新的战争。美国侵略者企图以这种极端冒险的挣扎，来维持美国独占资本家的战争利润，来继续搜括各附庸国的人力物力。因此，现在摆到为美国仆从的各国政府面前的是一个严重的考验。这些国家的政府必须对美国破坏朝鲜停战谈判、疯狂滥炸我国东北、大量撒布细菌、扩大侵略战争的日益严重的罪行，表示自己的态度。谁主张并努力制止了美国侵略者的滔天罪行，他便可以取得机会摆脱美国侵略者给他设下的新战争的陷阱；谁要是支持和同意美国侵略者的这种滔天罪行，或借词加以推诿和掩饰，他便最后证明自己完全是美国侵略者的走卒，证明他和美国侵略者一样地是人类正义和安全的死敌。
    我国人民坚决支持我国外交部周恩来部长的严正声明，我们对于美国侵略者的一切罪行，特别是对于利用日本细菌战犯来屠杀和毒害我国人民的美国凶手，一定要予以严重的惩罚，一定要讨还这无尽的血债。我国人民对于美国侵略者的任何挑衅是无所畏惧的，因为我们深知敌人愈疯狂的时候，正是敌人愈加孤立和绝望的时候。我国人民伟大的抗美援朝运动，将以更广阔的规模前进；中朝人民的英雄子弟将以更沉重的打击去回答疯狂肆虐的美国侵略者。全世界爱好和平、主持正义的人类将和我们在一起，为制止美国侵略者的滔天罪行、严惩残暴不仁的美国凶手而奋斗到底。
