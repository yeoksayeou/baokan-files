Xinhua News Agency, Tbilisi, 26th: According to TASS, Chinese writers Ding Ling and Cao Yu, who came to the Soviet Union to attend the centenary memorial ceremony of the death of the great Russian writer Gogol, are visiting the Georgian Republic. In the republic's capital, Tbilisi, they visited museums, the Palace of Young Pioneers, Tbilisi University, the Samgori Irrigation Project, and other places of interest, and met with writers from the Georgian Writers Association and the republic. The guests also visited Stalin's hometown of Gori and other scenic spots related to Stalin's life and revolutionary activities. They traveled to Sukhumi on the 25th to continue their visit.

Before leaving Tbilisi for Sukhumi, Chinese female writer Ding Ling gave an interview to a TASS reporter, describing the impressions they gained from their visit to Georgia and the warm welcome they received from the Soviet people. She pointed out: Georgia is carrying out huge construction work for peace and the welfare of the people. And the American cannibals are committing new crimes of spreading bacteria in Korea and Northeast China. During our visit, we have personally witnessed and felt the Soviet people's anger and protest against these crimes. The people of the world will never forgive the crimes of the American aggressors. The unbreakable friendship between the great Soviet and Chinese peoples is a reliable guarantee of world peace.
