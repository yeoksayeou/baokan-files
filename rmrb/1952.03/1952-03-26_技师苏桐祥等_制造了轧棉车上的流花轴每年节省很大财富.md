To the Editor:

Technicians Su Tongxiang and Wang Zhongyuan of the Xinjian Factory in Cheng'an County, Hebei Province, successfully manufactured a lint discharge shaft for the roller cotton gin, eliminating the phenomenon of oil-stained cotton. In the past, oil-stained cotton was a serious problem with roller cotton gins, with each gin ruining about half a kilogram of cotton per day due to oil stains. To overcome this problem, they made a wooden four-toothed lint discharge shaft. However, after prolonged use, the wood became sticky and easily attracted cotton; the four-toothed gears also did not rotate smoothly. They continued their research and wrapped the wooden lint discharge shaft with lead sheeting, and changed the four-toothed gears into fully rounded gear teeth, driven by iron chains. In this way, during ginning, the cotton rolled down the lint discharge shaft and into the cotton collection bucket, and the cotton fiber was no longer contaminated by oil. This factory has forty roller cotton gins, which can now avoid forty jin of oil-stained cotton per day (the value difference between good cotton and oil-stained cotton is six thousand yuan per jin). This innovation can save the factory 19,200 jin of oil-stained cotton per year (based on the factory's forty machines), creating a great deal of wealth for the country.

    制造了轧棉车上的流花轴每年节省很大财富
    编辑同志：河北成安县新建工厂技师苏桐祥、王仲元，制造轧棉车上的流花轴成功，根绝了油污皮棉的现象。过去，轧花车上油污皮棉很厉害，每天一辆轧花车要污毁一斤皮棉。为了克服这种毛病，他们做了一个木质的四牙轮的流花轴。但使用久了，木头发黏，容易沾花；四牙轮在转行时也不滑畅。他们继续钻研，在木质流花轴上裹了铅皮，再把四牙轮改成全圆面的牙齿轮，用铁炼子带动。这样，轧花时，棉花顺流花轴滚下，流到盛花桶，皮棉不再被油沾污了。这个厂有四十辆轧花车，每天就能少油污四十斤皮棉（好皮棉和油污皮棉价值，每斤相差六千元）。这一创制，每年可使该厂少出油污棉一万九千二百斤（以全厂四十台车计），为国家创造了很多的财富。
