    Cadres of the People's Bank of Pingyuan Province, Yutai Branch,
    Should Be Punished for Illegally Stealing and Selling Relief Grain
    Comrade Editor: In 1950, the spring famine in Yutai County, Pingyuan Province, was severe. In order to support the disaster victims' production, the Shanxian Central Branch of the Provincial People's Bank allocated approximately 600,000 jin of lentil beans to the Yutai Branch in February. However, this batch of grain encountered heavy snow on the way to Yutai. After it was transported to Yutai, it was stored in the warehouse without being dried in the sun. After the bad element Dong Xiyan found out about this, he colluded with Wang Yinming, a correspondent (now the cashier) of the Yutai Branch, to steal and sell the grain. He said to Wang, "The beans are bound to gain weight after being hit by snow and not being dried in the sun. Let's make some money from it!" As a result, they stole and sold 10,000 jin, obtaining 10 million yuan. Wang received 5.5 million yuan, and Dong received 4.5 million yuan. In March, Dong Xiyan again colluded with Dai Enlang, the manager of the branch (currently the director of the issuing treasury of the Shanxian Central Branch), to steal more than 23,000 jin of beans and invest them in Lu Zhaowen's oil mill in Dongguan, Yutai, as capital. Fearing that the matter would be exposed, they gave Wang Yinming another 3.5 million yuan, asking Wang to keep the secret. After that, Dai and Dong also stole more than 31,000 jin of beans and transported them to Guting Town to sell, obtaining more than 30 million yuan, which was divided equally among Dai, Dong, and Wang. When the disaster victims came to collect the production loan grain, Dai Enlang took the opportunity to deceive them by reducing the quantity and mixing in moldy beans. I suggest severely punishing these corrupt elements.

    人民银行平原省鱼台支行干部
    违法盗卖救济粮应受惩办
    编辑同志：一九五零年平原省鱼台县春荒严重，省人民银行单县中心支行为了支持灾民生产，在二月间曾拨给鱼台支行贷粮豆子约六十万斤。但这批粮食运往鱼台时，中途遇着大雪，等运到鱼台后，也没倒晒就入了仓。这事被坏分子董希言知道后，他就勾引鱼台支行通信员王荫明（现任该行出纳）同谋盗卖，对王说：“豆子经雪一打，又没翻晒，准涨秤，咱们从中弄两个花花吧！”结果盗卖了一万斤，得款一千万元；王分得五百五十万元，董得四百五十万元。到三月间，董希言又勾引该行经理戴恩朗（现单县中心支行发行库主任），同谋盗出豆子约二万三千多斤，投入鱼台东关吕兆文油坊作资金。他们怕事情泄露，又分给了王荫明三百五十万元，叫王保守秘密。此后戴、董还盗出豆子约三万一千多斤运往谷亭镇变卖，得款三千多万元，由戴、董、王三人平分。等到灾民来领生产贷粮时，戴恩朗就乘机用减少份量、掺杂霉烂豆子等方法来欺骗灾民。我建议严惩这些贪污分子。
