    Introducing Methods for Utilizing Waste Batteries
    Editor: On January 30th, the People's Daily published my suggestion on saving waste batteries. Some people wrote to ask about specific methods. Now I will introduce the saving methods as follows:
    (1) Method for Utilizing Waste A Batteries: Remove the paper tube outside the waste A battery, use a hammer to pierce several small holes in the zinc skin, the distance between the holes should be one centimeter, and the depth should be one centimeter, and place it in a glass tube. Then, dissolve 5% of sal ammoniac (chemical name ammonium chloride) in a cup of clean water, mix it, and pour it into the glass tube (about 80% full). Soon the waste A battery will generate current. If the waste A battery is ineffective after a long time using the above method, a zinc plate can be added around the battery.
    (2) Method for Utilizing Waste Flashlight Batteries: Remove the sealing shellac of the waste flashlight battery (if it is an iron cover, pry it open), inject a mixture of 5% sal ammoniac and clean water, and wait for it to penetrate to restore the current. Then melt the shellac to seal the opening for use. If there is no sal ammoniac, it can be replaced with table salt, but the effect is worse.
    (3) Method for Utilizing Waste B Batteries: Remove the sealing shellac of the waste B battery, then disassemble the welding wires of the small batteries inside, and implement the treatment method for flashlight batteries. After restoring the current, seal the opening with shellac, and solder the copper welding wires in series as before (note that the anode welding wire must not be short-circuited – that is, contact the zinc cylinder cathode), put it back into the original cardboard box, and there is no need to seal the shellac again for use.

    介绍废电池利用法
    编辑同志：一月三十日人民日报刊载了我对节约废电池的建议，有人写信来问具体方法，今把节约方法介绍如下：
    （一）废A电池利用法：去掉废A电池外面的纸筒，用锤子在锌皮上刺若干小孔，孔和孔的距离一公分，深一公分，置玻璃筒中。然后用净水一杯，溶入百分之五的硇砂（化学名氯化铵），混合后倒入玻璃筒中（八分满即可），不久废A电即发生电流。如废A电池因日久用上法不生效时，可加锌板一块于电池周围。
    （二）废手灯电池利用法：把废手灯电池封口的火漆去掉（如系铁盖把它揭开），注以百分之五的?砂和净水的混合液，俟其渗入，即恢复电流。然后化开火漆封口，即可使用。如无?砂，可以食盐代之，但效果较差。
    （三）废B电池利用法：去掉废B电池封口火漆，再把其中的小电池焊线拆开，按手灯电池的处理方法施行。等到恢复了电流，然后用火漆封口，仍以铜焊线照旧串连焊住（注意阳极焊线不可短接——即接触锌筒阴极），纳入原来纸盒，不必再封火漆，即可使用。吴金铭
