Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Li Wenxing, the chief representative of the fire victims in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, Hong Kong, delivered a radio speech on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the 17th, accusing British imperialism of persecuting Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong. The text of the speech is as follows:

Dear compatriots:

I am Li Wenxing, the chief representative of the fire victims in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, Hong Kong. On behalf of the more than 16,000 fire victims in Tung Tau Tsuen, Hong Kong, I would like to express my gratitude to the compatriots of the motherland for their support and assistance! At the same time, I want to use unparalleled anger and hatred to accuse the British imperialist government in Hong Kong of the crime of persecuting our Chinese compatriots!

In Hong Kong, I personally witnessed and experienced the atrocities of British imperialism persecuting us with shameless, despicable, and vicious means. British imperialism is increasingly adopting a hostile attitude towards our Chinese compatriots and carrying out provocative acts against our country. Following the Tung Tau Tsuen fire incident, the barbaric and shameless bloody atrocities of slaughtering our compatriots on March 1st occurred again. This is intolerable to the Chinese people. Today, as the chief representative and witness of the fire victims in Tung Tau Tsuen, I want to accuse the British imperialists of their atrocities!

The great fire in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, Hong Kong, occurred at 6:45 p.m. on November 21, 1951. This sudden fire lasted for more than four hours, creating a disaster area of four square kilometers and more than 3,000 disaster-stricken households, with more than 16,000 fire victims. This was the largest and most bizarre fire in Hong Kong in more than 100 years. Before the fire, the British imperialist government in Hong Kong had announced that it would expand the area of Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon. Residents of Tung Tau Tsuen near the airport opposed the unreasonable forced relocation by British imperialism in order to protect their residential rights. The origin of the fire was in a small textile factory. The two brothers who owned this small textile factory, one in charge of the textile factory and one working in the British imperialist government in Hong Kong, suddenly moved away two days before the fire. This was not accidental. During the fire, the British imperialist government in Hong Kong not only did not actively put out the fire, but instead prevented residents from putting out the fire; and even condoned organized bandits taking advantage of the fire to loot. After the fire, the British imperialist government in Hong Kong did not provide any relief, causing more than 16,000 fire victims to suffer from hunger and cold, and become displaced. On November 23, they announced that "no new wooden houses are allowed to be built in the disaster area of Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon," and designated us to move to a remote, mountainous area near the sea called Ngau Tau Kok, forcing more than 16,000 fire victims who rely on labor income in the urban area to make a living to be unable to survive! This series of persecutions, this strange fire, clearly proves that it was planned and arranged by British imperialism in Hong Kong. British imperialists vainly attempt to achieve their conspiracies and goals through such despicable, vicious, insidious, and cruel means! They dare not investigate the cause of the fire; under the questioning of people in society, they never dare to tell the truth about the fire. However, we have long seen through the sinister and vicious hearts of the British imperialists!

What is even more infuriating is that the British imperialist government in Hong Kong not only failed to provide relief but also obstructed the relief work of compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The "Kowloon City Neighborhood Welfare Association Fire Relief Committee," an incarnation of the Hong Kong British imperialist government's Social Affairs Bureau, withheld HK$220,000 and a large number of clothing items donated by compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon out of their enthusiasm for mutual love and mutual assistance, and has never distributed them to the fire victims! The continuous development of these criminal acts is to expel me from Hong Kong and attempt to unreasonably prevent the "Delegation of People's Organizations from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City to Comfort Compatriots Affected by the Disaster in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City" from entering Hong Kong. On March 1, 1952, British imperialists once again planned and arranged the massacre of our Chinese residents who welcomed the delegation and the arrest of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. A large number of British police officers used police cars to unreasonably crash into more than 10,000 welcoming crowds, and dispatched a large number of fully armed military police to the scene to suppress them, throwing a large number of tear gas and opening fire, causing many Chinese compatriots to be shot and injured on the spot, including Chen Dayi who was shot several times and in danger of his life, and many others were beaten by British military police, and more than 100 people were unreasonably arrested. This illegal arrest continued until March 3, and the arrested patriotic compatriots were illegally tried under the so-called "charges" of "riot" or "inciting sabotage of peace." British imperialism first conspired to set fire to persecute our Chinese compatriots, and then barbarously and shamelessly bloodily massacred our Chinese compatriots. This provocative act of British imperialism has been exposed more nakedly. This is what we cannot tolerate. I want to accuse the compatriots of the motherland; I want to accuse the people of the world.

At the same time, I also want to accuse the British imperialist government in Hong Kong of persecuting me personally. This persecution is the same in nature as other incidents of persecution of the Chinese people before and after I was forced to leave Hong Kong. At 3:15 a.m. on January 10, 1952, I was unreasonably arrested by British police at my home. A total of more than ten police officers came, led by a British man in plain clothes, woke me up, and searched my house extensively. I questioned the British police, "I have not committed any crime, why are you looking for me in the middle of the night," but the police did not give any reason. Under armed surveillance, I was taken to the police station, and that afternoon, I was forcibly forced to leave Hong Kong by the Hong Kong British imperialist government. In Hong Kong, British imperialist police can break into private residences in the middle of the night without announcing any reason, arrest people at will, and they can use force to force a Chinese person to leave his own land! When the British police in Hong Kong read the so-called "deportation order" to me, it even contained such contemptuous and absurd words, saying: "The Governor of Hong Kong is not interested in you." Today, as a great Chinese person, I declare to the world: the Chinese people will not allow anyone to bully them!

MacKenzie, the Commissioner of Police of the British imperialist government in Hong Kong, issued a statement on my departure, saying that I had political activities. What kind of political activities? It is because I, as the chief representative of the fire victims, appealed to people in society for sympathy and support. This is for our survival and basic human rights and freedom. If it is said that asking for survival and basic human rights and freedom is political activity, then not only more than 16,000 fire victims must participate in this political activity, but also the Chinese people of Hong Kong and Kowloon must participate! No matter what form of persecution, our struggle must be carried through to the end!

Compatriots: The bizarre fire in Tung Tau Tsuen, the bloody massacre on March 1st, and the illegal arrests of me and many compatriots in Hong Kong, this series of conspiracies, a series of planned and arranged crimes, all show the hostile, cruel, and barbaric ferocious faces of British imperialism towards our Chinese compatriots. These persecutions are not local incidents, but British imperialists, complying with the will of the American imperialist aggressors, colluding further, engaging in military expansion and war preparations in Hong Kong, and attempting to turn Hong Kong into a base for aggression against our country. The continuous occurrence of these events is the result of British imperialism further kowtowing to American imperialism after the ascension of the warmonger Churchill. The compatriots of our motherland must not sit idly by and watch the two million compatriots in Hong Kong suffer the persecution of imperialism. We must use all our strength and all practical actions to support the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong in their just struggle against this provocative persecution! The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government issued a statement on January 25, lodging a serious protest with the British imperialist government. The Central People's Government solemnly announced on behalf of the entire Chinese people: "The government of the United Kingdom must immediately stop such barbaric persecution of Chinese residents and acts of openly provoking the People's Republic of China, otherwise, the government of the United Kingdom must bear full responsibility for all the consequences." After the March 1st incident, the people of the whole country expressed unparalleled anger and determination to support the Hong Kong patriotic compatriots in their struggle to the end. People's organizations in various parts of the country have issued many protests and statements. The history of foreign imperialists invading China has long been declared over since the founding of the People's Republic of China. The powerful Chinese people will not allow anyone to invade and bully them. We have the confidence and determination that our struggle will be victorious—a complete victory!

    香港九龙城东头村火灾灾民总代表李文兴发表广播演说
    控诉英帝国主义迫害香港我国同胞的罪行
    【新华社十八日讯】香港九龙城东头村火灾灾民总代表李文兴十七日在中央人民广播电台广播讲演，控诉英帝国主义迫害香港我国同胞的罪行。讲演词如下：亲爱的同胞们：
    我是香港九龙城东头村火灾灾民总代表李文兴。我要代表香港东头村一万六千多灾民，对祖国同胞给我们的支持和援助表示感谢！同时，我要以无比的愤怒和仇恨，来控诉在香港的英帝国主义政府迫害我国同胞的罪行！
    我在香港亲眼看到、亲身体验到英帝国主义用无耻的、卑劣的和毒辣的手段迫害我们的暴行。英帝国主义日甚一日地对我国同胞采取敌视态度，并且对我国进行挑衅行为。继东头村火灾事件，又发生了三月一日屠杀我同胞的野蛮无耻的血腥暴行。这是我们中国人民所不能容忍的。我今天要以东头村火灾灾民总代表和证人身份，来控诉英帝国主义的暴行！
    香港九龙东头村的大火灾发生在一九五一年十一月二十一日下午六时四十五分。这个突如其来的大火延烧了四个多钟头，造成了四平方公里大的灾区和三千多灾户，一万六千多灾民。这是香港一百多年来最大的最离奇的火灾。在大火发生之前，香港英帝国主义政府曾经宣布要在九龙扩大启德机场的面积，机场附近的东头村居民为了自己居住的权益，反对过英帝国主义无理迫迁。而火灾的起源，又是在一家小纺织厂中，这一个小纺织厂的两弟兄，一个主持纺织厂，一个在香港英帝国主义政府机关内工作，火灾的前两天，他们突然搬走了，这不是偶然的。而大火燃烧的过程中，香港英帝国主义政府不但不积极地救火，相反地阻拦居民去救火；并且还纵容有组织的匪徒趁火打劫。火灾以后，在香港的英帝国主义政府更不进行救济，使一万六千多灾民饥寒交迫，流离失所，并且在十一月二十三日宣布“九龙东头村灾区以内，不准重新搭盖木屋”，指定我们搬到远离市区，靠近海边的一个叫做牛头角的荒山野岭的地方去居住，迫使一万六千多在市区依靠劳动收入来维持生活的灾民无法生活下去！这一连串的迫害，这一场奇突的大火，非常清楚地证明了是在香港的英帝国主义有计划、有布置地一手制造出来的。英帝国主义者妄想通过这种卑鄙毒辣、阴险残酷的手段来达到他们的阴谋和目的！他们不敢调查火灾发生的原因；在社会人士的质问之下，他们也从不敢说出起火的真情。但是，阴险毒辣的英帝国主义者的心肠，我们早就看清楚了！
    更令人愤恨万分的是，在香港的英帝国主义政府不但没有进行救济，还阻挠港九各界同胞的救济工作。一个香港英帝国主义政府社会局的化身的“九龙城街坊福利会火灾筹赈委员会”，把港九各界同胞在互爱互助的热情下所募集起来的捐款港币二十二万元和大批衣物加以扣留，一直不发给灾民！这一些罪恶行为的连续发展，就是驱逐我离开香港，并且企图无理阻止“广东省、广州市各界人民团体慰问九龙城东头村受灾同胞代表团”进入香港。在一九五二年三月一日，英帝国主义者又有计划、有布置地屠杀欢迎代表团的我国居民和逮捕在港的爱国同胞。大批英国警察，用警车向一万多欢迎群众进行了无理的冲击，并且调集了大批全副武装的军警到场镇压，投掷大量催泪弹和开枪射击，使我国同胞当场中弹受伤许多人，其中陈达仪身上被打中几枪，生命危险，还有很多人被英国军警打伤，一百多人被无理拘捕。这种非法逮捕一直继续到三月三日，并且用所谓“暴动”或者“挑动破坏和平”的“罪名”对被捕的爱国同胞进行非法审判。英帝国主义先是阴谋纵火迫害我国同胞，后来又野蛮无耻地血腥屠杀我国同胞，英帝国主义这种挑衅行为，已经更露骨地暴露出来了。这是我们所万不能容忍的，我要向祖国同胞们控诉；我要向全世界人民控诉。
    同时，我还要控诉在香港的英帝国主义政府对我个人的迫害。这种迫害，和我被迫离开香港以前和以后的其他迫害中国人民的事件的性质是一样的。一九五二年一月十日上午三时十五分，我在家中被英国警察无理拘捕。一共来了十多个警察，由一个穿便衣的英国人率领，把我叫醒了，并且在我的屋子里大肆搜查。我质问英国警察“我没有犯罪，为什么半夜三更找我去”，但是警察并不说明任何理由。在武装的监视下，我被带到警署，当天下午，我就被香港英帝国主义政府用武力强迫离开了香港。在香港，英帝国主义的警察可以不宣布任何理由深夜闯进私人住宅，随便捕人，并且他们可以用武力强迫一个中国人民离开他自己的土地！香港的英国警察对我宣读所谓“递解令”的时候，其中竟有这种轻蔑侮弄的荒谬的词句，说：“港督对你不感兴趣”。我今天在这里以一个伟大的中国人民的身份对全世界宣布：中国人民是不容许任何人欺侮的！
    香港英帝国主义政府警务处长麦景陶曾对我的出境发表声明，说我有政治活动。怎样的政治活动呢？是因为我当了灾民总代表向社会人士呼吁同情和支援，这是为了我们的生存和基本的人权自由，如果说为了要求生存和基本的人权自由就是政治活动，那这种政治活动不但是一万六千多灾民都要参加，而且是香港九龙的中国人民都要参加的！不管任何方式的迫害，我们的斗争一定要坚持到底！
    同胞们：东头村的离奇的大火，三月一日的血腥屠杀，以及对我和许多在港同胞的非法逮捕，这一连串的阴谋，一连串的有计划有布置的罪行，都显示了英帝国主义对我国同胞所采取的仇视的、残忍的、野蛮的狰狞嘴脸，这一些迫害，不是什么地方性的事件，是英帝国主义者顺从美帝国主义侵略者的意旨，更进一步地勾结起来，在香港进行扩军备战，企图把香港变成侵略我国基地的阴谋。这些事件的不断发生，正是战争贩子邱吉尔登台之后，英帝国主义对美帝国主义进一步屈膝的结果。我们祖国的同胞决不能坐视香港二百万同胞横遭帝国主义的迫害，我们必须以一切力量、一切实际行动来支援香港爱国同胞对这种挑衅性的迫害进行正义斗争！中央人民政府外交部在一月二十五日发表了声明，对英帝国主义政府提出了严重的抗议。中央人民政府代表全中国人民庄严地宣布：“英国联合王国政府必须立即制止这类蛮横迫害中国居民并向中华人民共和国公开挑衅的暴行，否则，英国联合王国政府必须对一切后果担负全部责任。”三月一日的事件以后，全国人民更表示了无比的愤怒和支持香港爱国同胞斗争到底的决心，全国各地各人民团体发表了许多抗议和声明。外国帝国主义者侵略中国的历史，从中华人民共和国成立起早已宣告结束了，强大的中国人民是不容许任何人侵略和欺侮的，我们有信心有决心，我们的斗争一定会得到胜利——彻底的胜利！
