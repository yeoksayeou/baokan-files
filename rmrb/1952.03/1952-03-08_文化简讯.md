Cultural Briefs

    ▲ In order to eliminate the unhealthy trend of shoddy and substandard work in the publishing industry, the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Press and Publication Bureau has decided to ban the illegal operations of two speculative publishers in Beijing, Xinchao Bookstore and Huoxing (Mars) Society. With the approval of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce has revoked their business licenses.
    The privately owned Xinchao Bookstore in Beijing was a typical speculative publisher, and most of its books were full of errors, shoddy, and pieced together by plagiarism. This newspaper's "Cultural Life" column on August 16th and August 25th of last year criticized this speculative bookstore. The store claimed to be engaged in publishing, but had no editorial organization. However, when registering with the government, it falsely reported the names of some professors, claiming they were the store's "editors." Many of the responsible personnel in the store were former high-ranking officials during the enemy puppet regime, and the store concealed the names or resumes of these people when applying for registration.
    The Huoxing Society, which was criticized in this newspaper's "Letters to the Editor" column on October 12th of last year, was also a business engaged solely in speculative publishing. The majority of its books were entirely or partially plagiarized from the contents of other people's publications, and some even contained serious political errors repeatedly. After these ugly behaviors of seriously infringing on the legitimate rights and interests of colleagues and deceiving readers were exposed, the person in charge of the society even attempted to quibble, lying to the Beijing Municipal Press and Publication Bureau about the printing factory, forging original manuscripts, and fabricating the names of "translators" in order to deceive the government. The society also had no editorial organization, but falsely reported some government workers as their "editors" and "editorial board members" to the government in order to gain the government's trust, and used this to speculate and profit, harming readers.

    ▲为了肃清出版业中粗制滥造的邪风，北京市人民政府新闻出版处决定取缔北京市两家投机出版商新潮书店和火星社的违法经营。经报请北京市人民政府批准后，已由市工商局撤销其营业执照。
    北京私营新潮书店是一家典型的投机出版商，它所出的书籍极多是谬误百出、粗制滥造、抄剪拼凑而成的。本报去年八月十六日、八月二十五日的“文化生活”栏，曾批评了这家投机书店。该店名为从事出版事业，却没有编辑机构，但在向政府登记时，竟伪报一些教授的名字，说是该店的“编辑”。该店负责人员中有不少曾经是敌伪时代的高级官吏，而该店在申请登记时，竟向政府隐瞒了这些人的姓名或履历。
    曾为本报去年十月十二日“读者来信”栏所批评的火星社，也是专门从事投机出版的商户，所出的书籍绝大部分是全部或局部剽窃他人出版物的内容，有的并连篇累牍地出现重大政治性的错误。而在此种严重侵害同业的正当权益和欺骗读者的丑恶行为被揭露后，该社负责人还企图狡赖，向北京市新闻出版处谎报印厂，假造原稿，捏造“译者”姓名，欺骗政府。该社也没有编辑机构，却向政府谎报一些政府工作人员为他们的“编辑”、“编委”，来骗取政府的信任，借以投机牟利贻害读者。
