    We Will Certainly Defeat the American Invaders' Germ Warfare
    Lin Shixiao, Deputy Secretary-General of the Red Cross Society of China
    Members of the Red Cross, workers of Red Cross branches in various regions, members of service teams, and all patriotic people, let us take active action to defeat the germ warfare of American imperialism!
    We can say with certainty: we will definitely defeat germ warfare! We will definitely shatter the new conspiracy of the American invaders.
    Why do we have such confidence? Because any bacteria and bacteria-carrying vector insects, their activity, their reproduction, and the harm they cause, all require certain conditions. That is to say, they are limited by certain conditions. If we can find these laws and create conditions that restrict them, and use all effective preventive measures, then the germ warfare of American imperialism, however vicious, can be completely defeated. Not to mention the distant past, let's just take our own experience as an example. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese imperialists, in order to save their dying fate, also used bacterial weapons such as plague and cholera in Zhejiang, Hunan, Hebei Central and other places, but the Japanese imperialists were still defeated by our Chinese people. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, from 1949 to the present, due to our various efforts in hygiene and epidemic prevention, there has been no outbreak of true cholera in the country. The serious plague in the Inner Mongolia Chahar League in 1949 was also extinguished by us. This proves that we have sufficient power to extinguish the bacteria spread by American imperialism. But we must actively create conditions to realize this possibility. We must not be careless or wait passively, but should immediately organize and act better for the victory of this struggle.
    The objects that bacteria can generally harm are nothing more than people, livestock, crops, and horticultural crops. We need to understand that in order for toxic bacteria to achieve its goal of harming human health, it must: first, be able to approach the human body or our food and drink; second, be able to invade the human body; and third, be able to survive and reproduce after invading the human body. And humans have a certain degree of resistance to bacteria, which greatly limits the harmful effects of toxic bacteria, not to mention the various natural conditions that limit its reproduction (such as light, heat, cold, dryness, and humidity).
    So, how can we prevent bacteria from approaching us and invading our bodies? First, let's analyze the routes through which it invades our bodies and causes its harm. First, it attaches to food and drink and enters the human body through the mouth. Its spread is mostly through flies, food, and unclean utensils. For example, cholera, typhoid, and dysentery bacteria approach us and invade the human body through flies, unclean water, or by attaching to food, drink, and utensils. Some enter the human body through the respiratory organs with the air, such as meningitis, pneumonia, and plague. Another opportunity to invade the human body is through damaged skin. These bacteria mostly use the soil where they are lurking as cover. Tetanus and anthrax bacilli are the most obvious examples. Some are transmitted into the human body by the bites of mosquitoes, lice, fleas, sandflies, etc. carrying the bacteria, such as encephalitis, dengue fever, trench fever, relapsing fever, plague, and kala-azar. From this, we can understand that if we can make good use of various favorable conditions and create conditions that restrict bacteria, the enemy's germ warfare, however vicious and sinister, can still be defended against.
    First of all, we must fully recognize the serious harm of the bacteriological warfare conducted by the American imperialists who have lost all conscience and violated humanity. Every patriotic person must be vigilant and not be careless. At the same time, every patriotic person should also realize that bacteriological warfare can be defended and can be defeated. Do not be afraid. Everyone should take active action to discover and eliminate on the spot. (See the "Propagandist's Speech" in the Anti-American Aid Korea Special Issue of this newspaper on March 16th) The method of eliminating on the spot is to implement disinfection. In places where there are chemical drugs, chemical drugs can be used to eliminate poisonous insects and poisonous substances. In places where there are no chemical drugs, simple burning or burying methods can also be used. As long as the poisonous insects and poisonous substances and their infectious materials are burned or buried deep in the soil, infection can be avoided.
    Second, any food, utensils, clothing, bedding, etc. that have come into contact with the poisonous insects and poisonous substances thrown by the American imperialists should be boiled or steamed before being used again, after the poisonous substances and poisonous insects on these things have been immediately killed, deeply buried or caught and burned. It is best not to drink contaminated river water or well water. If you must drink it, it must be boiled. All bacteria can be killed by boiling to a steam temperature of 120 degrees.
    Third, the hands of those who participate in burning, burying, cooking and other work should pay special attention to disinfection. If there are no disinfectants, wash with hot water soaked in ash from the stove, or wipe with vinegar before washing clean.
    Fourth, in places where American imperialists have been found to spread bacteria, or where it is estimated that they will attack, it is necessary to do a good job in environmental sanitation, so that the bacteria dropped by the enemy will lose the opportunity to parasitize and have no conditions for reproduction: the indoor courtyards are often cleaned; the room should be ventilated and dry, and rat holes should be blocked to avoid the breeding of fleas. Water pits around the residence should be dredged, small ones should be filled, and large ones that can raise fish should be used to raise fish to prevent mosquito breeding. Toilets and livestock pens should be cleaned regularly and padded with dry soil; garbage and feces should be piled up or stored in deeper pits, and covered with clean soil to prevent flies from using them to parasitize and reproduce. The kitchen should be kept dry and clean. Wells should preferably be covered with well lids, and the wellhead should be higher than the surrounding area to prevent outside dirt and sewage from flowing in.
    If we all organize and do this, germ warfare will not be terrible, and we will definitely be able to defeat germ warfare!

### 我们一定能够打败美国侵略者的细菌战

    我们一定能够打败美国侵略者的细菌战
    中国红十字总会副秘书长  林士笑
    红十字会的会员们，各地红十字分会的工作者们，各服务队的队员们，全体爱国人民，积极行动起来，打败美帝国主义的细菌战！
    我们可以肯定地说：我们一定能够打败细菌战！我们一定能够粉碎美国侵略者的新阴谋。
    为什么我们有这样的信心呢？因为任何细菌和带有细菌的媒介昆虫，它的活动、它的繁殖和发生危害作用，都需要一定的条件，也就是说它是受一定条件的限制的。如果我们能找到这些规律，进而造成限制它的条件，运用一切有效的预防办法，美帝国主义的细菌战虽然很凶毒，却是完全可以打败的。远的且不说，就拿我们本身的体验来说吧，在抗日战争中日本帝国主义者为挽救其死亡的命运，也曾在浙江、湖南、冀中等地使用过鼠疫、霍乱等细菌武器，但是日本帝国主义仍然被我们中国人民打败了。中华人民共和国成立以后，从一九四九年到现在，由于我们在卫生防疫工作上的种种努力，全国就再没有发生过真性霍乱的病疫了，一九四九年内蒙察盟的严重鼠疫也被我们扑灭了。这就证明：我们有足够的力量扑灭美帝国主义所撒布的细菌。但我们必须积极地去创造条件，实现这种可能。我们不能马虎大意，或消极等待，而应当立即为这个斗争的胜利更好地组织起来，行动起来。
    细菌所能侵害的对象，大体不外是人、家畜、农作物和园艺作物等。我们要了解，毒菌要能够达到它为害人类健康的目的，必须：第一能够接近人体或我们的饮食品；第二能够侵入人体；第三侵入人体以后有可能生存繁殖。而人是具有某种程度的抵抗细菌的能力的，这就使毒菌的危害作用大受限制，更不用说限制其繁殖的种种自然条件了。（如光、热、冷、干、湿。）
    那么，怎么样才能不让细菌接近我们、侵入我们的身体呢？先来分析一下它是经由那些途径侵入我们的身体，而发生它的危害作用的。第一，它附于饮食物上，从口腔侵入人体，它的传播多借助于蝇子、食物和不清洁的食具等。如霍乱、伤寒、痢疾菌就是经过蝇子、不洁的水，或附于饮食物、食具来接近我们，侵入人体的。有的是随着空气经呼吸器官侵入人体的，如脑膜炎、肺炎、鼠疫等就是走的这条“路”。侵入人体的另一个机会就是从破损的皮肤侵入，这类病菌多是以它所潜伏的土壤为掩护，如破伤风、炭疽杆菌就是最明显的例子。有的经带有该种病菌的蚊、虱、蚤、白蛉子等刺螫传入人体，如大脑炎、登革热、战壕热、回归热、鼠疫、黑热病等就是依赖上述媒介侵入人体的。由此，就可以懂得：假如我们能够很好地利用各种有利条件，并创造限制细菌的条件，敌人的细菌战虽然十分毒辣、十分险恶，还是可以防御的。
    首先，我们必须充分认识到丧尽天良、违背人道的美帝国主义者进行细菌战的严重危害性，每一个爱国的人民都要提高警惕，不要麻痹大意；同时，每一个爱国的人民也应该认识到细菌战是可以防御的、能够战胜的，不要害怕，大家要积极行动起来，就地发现，就地扑灭。（参看本报三月十六日抗美援朝专刊“宣传员讲话”）就地扑灭的方法，就是实行消毒。在有化学药品的地方可用化学药品消灭毒虫毒物。在没有化学药品的地方，也可用简单的烧或埋的办法处理。只要把毒虫毒物及其传染物烧掉，或深埋在土里，就可以免去传染。
    第二、凡是美帝国主义者所投掷的毒虫、毒物接触过的食物、食具、衣服、被褥等，除把这些东西上的毒物毒虫立即打死深埋或捉起烧掉之外，这些东西应经过煮、蒸之后再用，被污染的河水、井水最好不饮用，要饮用时一定得煮沸过。一切细菌，只要煮沸到一百二十度蒸汽温度就可以被杀死。
    第三、参加烧、埋、煮等工作的人的手应当特别注意消毒。如果消毒药都没有，就用灶内的灰浸热水洗，或用醋先擦洗一下之后再洗干净。
    第四、已发现美帝国主义者撒布细菌的地方，或估计它会下毒手的地方，一定要搞好环境卫生，使敌人投下的细菌失去寄生的机会，没有繁殖的条件：室内庭院常打扫干净；室内要通风干燥，鼠洞要堵死，以免滋生跳蚤。住地周围的水坑要疏通，小的要填平，大的能养鱼的就养鱼，以免蚊子繁殖。厕所畜圈要常清除并垫上干土；垃圾粪便要堆起来或存在较深的坑里，都要盖上净土，免得蝇子借以寄生和繁殖。厨房要保持干燥清洁。井最好用井盖，井口井沿要比四周高，不让外面污物污水流进去。
    我们都组织起来，都这样作了，细菌战也就不可怕了，我们就一定能打败细菌战！
