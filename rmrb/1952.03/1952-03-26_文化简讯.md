Cultural Briefs

    ▲ Harbin Medical University, in order to improve the quality of teaching, has organized all medical education cadres to study Pavlov's theory since mid-November 1951. Everyone has been studying for more than two months now. After studying, listening to reports, and discussing, all medical education cadres have gained a preliminary understanding of Pavlov's theory and have seriously criticized conservative and erroneous ideas, especially Virchow's cellular pathology theory. Many professors and lecturers have realized their past mistakes, conducted self-reflection and self-criticism, acknowledged the superiority of Soviet medicine, and expressed their determination to implement it in teaching and medical practice.
    Currently, the Research Department of Harbin Medical University has compiled the second collection of "The Development of Pavlov's Theory," which will be published by the end of March and will be used to launch new studies in early April.

    ▲ The filmstrip work in Chahar Province has achieved considerable success. The province has decided to vigorously develop filmstrip work this year, striving to equip every district and most mines and factories with filmstrip equipment. In February this year, the Provincial Department of Culture and Education held a training class for filmstrip work cadres in the province. There were 99 trainees. A feature of this training class is the comprehensive training of filmstrip workers. The trainees included primary school teachers and health, forestry and other workers. Although the training period was only two weeks, the trainees initially recognized the development direction of filmstrip work and learned the principles of filmstrip structure, the methods of drawing filmstrips, and the knowledge of projection and sound recording technology.

    ▲ The Guangxi Branch of the Central Institute for Nationalities was officially established on March 19. There are 150 students, including children from 13 ethnic minorities such as Miao, Yao, Dong, Zhuang, and Hui from Guangxi Province. The first phase of the study period is tentatively set at five months, and the content of the study mainly includes education on patriotism and ethnic policies. In addition, short-term training courses for ethnic minorities have also been opened in areas with concentrated ethnic minorities in Yishan County, Guangxi.

    ▲哈尔滨医科大学为了提高教学质量，自一九五一年十一月中旬起，组织全体医学教育干部学习巴甫洛夫的学说。现在大家已经学习了两个多月了。全体医学教育干部经过了学习、听报告、讨论后，对巴甫洛夫的学说已有了初步体会，对保守的错误的思想，特别是魏尔啸的细胞病理学说进行了严肃的批判。有好多教授、讲师认识到自己过去的错误，进行了反省和检讨，承认了苏联医学的优越性，并表示决心在实践中把它贯彻到教学和医疗中去。
    目前哈尔滨医科大学研究处又编印了“巴甫洛夫学说之发展”第二集，三月末即可出版，准备于四月初展开新的学习。
    ▲幻灯工作在察哈尔省已取得相当成绩。该省决定今年大力发展幻灯工作，争取全省每一个区和大多数的矿厂都有幻灯的设备。今年二月间，该省文教厅举办了一期全省幻灯工作干部训练班。学员共九十九人。这期训练班的一个特点是全面地培养幻灯工作人员。学员中有小学教师和卫生、农林等工作人员。学习期限虽仅为两周，但学员们都初步认清了幻灯工作的发展方向，并学习了幻灯构造原理，灯片绘制方法及放映收音技术等方面的知识。
