The Soaring Patriotic Enthusiasm of the People of All Nationalities in the Motherland
—One Week in Chengdu
Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation Southwest Branch Representative Pei Guang

We arrived in Chengdu on February 19th. At that time, the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the Western Sichuan District and Chengdu was entering a tense and fierce stage. We read many letters in the newspapers from cadres, workers, shop assistants, students, and citizens. They proposed to welcome us by doing a good job in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; they angrily protested against the crimes of unscrupulous merchants who harmed the Volunteer Army and demanded that the government severely punish them. All of this greatly encouraged us. During our work, we also personally witnessed many touching patriotic actions by people from all walks of life. Wang Zhiqing, a worker from the Hankou Automobile Materials Company, exposed the unscrupulous merchant Qiu Wanggen at the meeting where Comrade Zhao Degong gave a report; at the same time, he handed over the ten taels of gold that the unscrupulous merchant Qiu Wanggen used to bribe him on the spot. After the shop assistants and workers in the cultural and educational supplies industry proposed to launch a more fierce attack on the big unscrupulous merchants and strive for new victories to welcome the "most beloved people," the Xu Junde group completely revealed the illegal acts of ten unscrupulous merchants and dozens of related shops in two days. The five combat teams of the papermaking industry shop assistants concentrated all their efforts on collecting the illegal facts of the big unscrupulous merchant Zhao Guojun. They ran from the West Gate to the North Gate, from the state-owned printing factory to the private printing factory, so busy that they only ate one meal a day, and finally revealed all the illegal acts of the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Guojun in two days. Shop assistant Zeng Rongmou had received small favors from his boss Bai Yunchen, and at first he was afraid to expose his boss's illegal acts; after listening to the report, he also asked to join the combat team. He said to us: "If I don't actively expose the illegal acts of the unlawful boss, what gifts can I use to welcome you?"

A worker named Deng Bochao from the hostel industry union was very active in the movement and repeatedly exposed the illegal acts of unscrupulous merchants, but later became somewhat complacent. After listening to the report, he examined himself and said: "A Volunteer Army comrade annihilated one hundred and twenty enemies without leaving the battlefield, made great contributions, and still wants to continue fighting; I have made a little achievement, and I am complacent and relaxed. This is a big mistake." In our work, we received many letters from people from all walks of life, all enthusiastically reporting to us their achievements in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The faculty and students of the College of Arts of West China University told us in a letter: They have already requested the government to arrest and punish the big corrupt elements Yang Siche and Wang Xiangui according to the law. They said: "Dear comrades: Your arrival has further encouraged our will and enthusiasm for the struggle. We must, on the basis of victory, further fight against the unlawful capitalists who endanger the people's construction cause. The school is the battlefield, and your heroic and exemplary behavior is our example."

On the 25th, we and the Korean People's Delegation to China visited the Southwest Institute for Nationalities together. As soon as we got out of the car outside the school gate, we were lifted up by young men and women of twenty-five fraternal nationalities and carried all the way to the venue. More than a dozen different languages cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" Songs and cheers resounded through the sky.

Here, we met with Tian Bao, Chairman of the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang, and Xia Ke Dao Deng, Vice Chairman. Vice Chairman Xia Ke Dao Deng very much hoped that we would go to the Tibetan Autonomous Region. He said: "The Tibetan Autonomous Region is different from the past. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, there was not a single bridge there that could accommodate three people walking side by side. After liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Tibetan people established their own government and carried out many important constructions, opening up broad prospects for the happy life of the Tibetan people." When we told him the news that we would go to Ganzi, he was extremely happy and said that he would personally come to Ganzi to meet us.

We received a large number of flowers and condolence bags and letters embroidered with various words and patterns from young men and women of twenty-five nationalities. Unable to hold them in our hands, they hung these gifts on our bodies and chests. Tibetan youth Qi Yaozu said: "Since the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea began, many of our classmates have taken out their most beloved national costumes and jewelry to donate. A Miao classmate who lived in the hospital saved her allowance every month and donated it all after being discharged from the hospital. Many female classmates worked hard to wash clothes for others, embroider handkerchiefs, and knit sweaters, using their labor income to make donations."

Comrades from the minority nationality delegation from Maoxian Prefecture to Beijing presented us with extremely precious hadas, musk, and cordyceps when we reported. Suo Guanying, Vice Chairman of the Provisional Military and Political Committee of the Fourth Tu Aba Choskia, presented Commander Peng Dehuai with a golden thread monkey fur coat and General Kim Il-sung with a leopard skin mattress. They also asked us about our life on the front lines and asked us what difficulties we had and what we needed. This simple and sincere feeling deeply moved us. On the front lines of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, we have the infinite power of dozens of fraternal nationalities of our great motherland as our backing, and we will achieve greater victories.

    祖国各族人民高涨的爱国热情
    ——成都一周记事之一
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团西南分团代表  裴光
    我们在二月十九日到达成都市。这时，川西区和成都市的反贪污、反盗窃斗争正进入紧张激烈的阶段。我们从报纸上读到了许多机关干部、工人、店员、学生和市民们写的信。他们提出要用搞好反贪污、反盗窃斗争来欢迎我们；他们愤怒地抗议奸商暗害志愿军的罪行，要求政府严惩奸商。这些都给我们以极大的鼓舞。工作中间，我们又亲眼看到了各界人民许多感人的爱国行动。汉口汽车材料行的工人王之清，在赵德恭同志作报告的会上，检举了奸商邱旺根；同时把奸商邱旺根用来收买他的十两黄金当场交了出来。文化教育用品业的店员工人们，提出向大奸商更加猛烈地进攻，争取新的胜利来迎接“最可爱的人”之后，徐俊德小组在两天内就把十名奸商和有关的几十家商店的违法行为全部揭露出来了。造纸业店员的五个战斗小组，集中全力收集大奸商赵国钧的犯法事实。他们从西门跑到北门，从公营印刷厂跑到私营印刷厂，忙得一天只吃一顿饭，终于在两天内把奸商赵国钧的全部违法行为揭露出来。店员曾荣谋因为受过老板白云臣的小恩小惠，最初不敢检举老板的违法行为；听了报告后，也请求参加战斗小组。他对我们说：“我不积极起来检举不法老板的犯法事，拿什么礼物欢迎你们？”
    有一个旅栈业工会的工人邓伯超，在运动中表现很积极，多次检举了奸商的违法行为，后来有些自满。听了报告以后，他自己检讨说：“一位志愿军同志消灭了一百二十个敌人都不下阵地，立了很大的功劳，还要继续战斗；我有了小小的一点成绩，就居功自满，松懈下来，这是很大的错误。”在工作中，我们接到各界人民的许多来信，都热烈地向我们报告他们在反贪污反盗窃斗争中的战果。华西大学文学院师生在来信中告诉我们：他们已经请求政府把大贪污分子杨思澈、王贤贵逮捕法办了。他们说：“亲爱的同志们：你们的到来，更鼓舞了我们斗争的意志和热情，我们一定要在胜利的基础上，更进一步向危害人民建设事业的不法资本家进行斗争。学校就是战场，你们的英雄模范行为就是我们的榜样。”
    二十五日，我们和朝鲜人民访华代表团一同去参观西南民族学院。我们刚在校门外下车，就被二十五种兄弟民族的男女青年抬了起来，一直抬到会场上。十几种不同的语言欢呼着：“毛主席万岁！”“金日成将军万岁！”歌声、欢呼声响彻云霄。
    在这里，我们会见了西康藏族自治区人民政府天宝主席，夏克刀登副主席。夏克刀登副主席很希望我们到藏族自治区去。他说：“藏族自治区和过去不同了，在国民党反动派统治时，那儿没有一座可容三个人并行的桥。解放后在毛主席领导下，建立了藏民自己的政府，进行了很多重要建设，为藏民的幸福生活开辟了广阔的道路。”当我们说我们将到甘孜去的消息时，他高兴极了，并表示要亲自到甘孜来接我们。
    我们收到二十五种民族青年男女赠送的大批鲜花和绣着各种文字、各样花纹的慰问袋、慰问信和礼物。手里拿不了，他们就把这些礼物挂在我们的身上、胸前。藏族青年齐耀祖说：“自从抗美援朝运动展开以来，我们很多同学把自己最心爱的民族衣服和首饰拿出来捐献。有一个住在医院里的苗族同学，按月把津贴保存好，出院后全部捐献了。许多女同学辛勤地代人洗衣，绣手帕，织毛衣，用劳动所得进行捐献。”
    茂县专区少数民族赴京参观团的同志在我们报告时，把极珍贵的哈达、麝香和虫草送给我们。四土阿坝绰斯甲临时军政委员会索观瀛副主席并献给彭德怀司令员金线猴皮大氅一件，献给金日成将军豹皮褥子一床。他们还关心地问到我们在前线的生活情况，问我们有什么困难，需要什么。这种朴实、真挚的感情，深深地感动了我们。在抗美援朝战线上，我们有伟大祖国的数十种兄弟民族的无穷力量作后盾，我们将取得更大的胜利。
