Cultural Briefs

    ▲ To strengthen the reform work of Beijing Normal University, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, with the approval of the Government Administration Council, merged the Teaching and Research Office and the Educational Training Class of the Renmin University of China into Beijing Normal University on February 23.
    ▲ More than 6,000 teachers, students, and staff members from primary and secondary schools in Beijing held an anti-corruption accusation meeting at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall on February 27. At the meeting, accusations were made against seven corrupt elements, including Zhu Jiayan (Acting Director of General Affairs of Beijing Normal University, who colluded with unscrupulous merchants to steal 130 million yuan of state assets in the construction and purchase of school buildings) who refused to confess their crimes. The Beijing Public Security Bureau was requested to arrest them on the spot and punish them according to law. Five corrupt criminals, including Xiao Zimei (Mathematics teacher at New England Middle School), were treated leniently because they confessed thoroughly.
    ▲ The film "Special Newsreel No. 3 of the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Movement," exposing the crimes of the big unscrupulous merchants who harmed the Chinese People's Volunteers, will be screened in Beijing cinemas.
    The film contains irrefutable evidence of the heinous crimes of big unscrupulous merchants Wang Kangnian, Zhang Xingen, Xu Miaoxin, and others. It also shows the protest made by Li Xuesan, head of the Chinese People's Volunteers' delegation returning from Korea, against the crimes of these unscrupulous merchants.
    The film was shot in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou and other places by the News Photography Team of the Beijing Film Studio, the East China District, in collaboration with the Shanghai Film Studio and the Shanghai United Film Studio. The film has been screened in Shanghai since the 2nd.
