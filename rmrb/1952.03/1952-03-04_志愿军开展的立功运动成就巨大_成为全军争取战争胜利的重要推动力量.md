Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, March 3rd: This reporter reports: The emulation campaign carried out in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has become an important driving force for the entire army to win the war. Over the past year, the entire army has produced 48 heroes and models, 265 special-class meritorious personnel, 2,475 first-class meritorious personnel, and tens of thousands of second-class and third-class meritorious personnel. Among these heroes, models, and meritorious personnel, members of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League account for approximately 70%.

In the war against aggression in Korea, the political work organs at all levels of the Volunteer Army attached great importance to carrying out the emulation campaign. This movement further developed the revolutionary heroism of commanders, fighters, and various staff members, filling the entire army with the spirit of struggling to overcome difficulties, complete tasks, and win honors, ensuring the victorious completion of combat missions.

The emulation campaign carried out in the Volunteer Army has two significant characteristics: one is that the emulation campaign has become a widespread mass movement in the entire army. "Everyone strives for merit, everything strives for merit!" has become the slogan of the entire army. From the front lines to the rear, from hospitals to transportation lines, all personnel are shouting the loudest slogan: "Strive to earn international merit!" Therefore, after each combat or work task is issued, commanders and fighters actively formulate merit plans, write guarantees or pledges, and launch merit competitions. Many commanders also actively participated in this movement, often publishing their merit plans to lower-level commanders and soldiers, and inviting soldiers and the masses to act as judges, so that their command art can be continuously improved. Another characteristic of the Volunteer Army's emulation campaign is the large increase in collectively meritorious units. The victories in the past battles in the war are the result of joint and coordinated operations by various units, which requires everyone and every unit to obey the overall intent, closely cooperate, and support each other. Therefore, in many units, from combat teams to companies, battalions, and regiments, all have formulated unit merit plans. When troops of different arms fought side by side, the soldiers created the method of "contractual merit." The famous Battle of Ma Liang Mountain was an example of this coordinated operation. In this battle, the infantry and artillery fully exerted the power of coordinated operations, killing and wounding a large number of enemy troops.

The political workers at all levels in the Volunteer Army, according to the actual requirements of the war against aggression in Korea, constantly enriched the content of the emulation campaign. They constantly put forward new and practical slogans to promote the troops to overcome various difficulties and strive for victory. The Fifth Company of a certain unit penetrated deep into the enemy's rear during the Fifth Battle. The company's political workers put forward the slogans of cherishing ammunition, cherishing food, cherishing the body, and cherishing comrades to inspire the morale of the troops. The soldiers actively used the enemy's weapons and ammunition, replenishing them while fighting; when food was not enough, they went to the mountains to dig wild vegetables and mixed them with grain to eat, and saved the good grain for the lightly wounded soldiers accompanying the team; many soldiers insisted on not drinking cold water, and made sure to cover themselves with raincloth when sleeping and resting. They overcame various difficulties, fought continuously for ten times, and annihilated more than 200 enemies, and the entire company collectively won the second-class merit.

### 志愿军开展的立功运动成就巨大  成为全军争取战争胜利的重要推动力量

    志愿军开展的立功运动成就巨大
    成为全军争取战争胜利的重要推动力量
    【新华社朝鲜前线三日电】本社记者报道：中国人民志愿军中开展的立功运动已成为全军争取战争胜利的重要的推动力量。一年多来，全军已涌现了四十八名英雄和模范、二百六十五名特等功臣、二千四百七十五名一等功臣和成万名二等功臣及三等功臣。在这些英雄模范和功臣中，中国共产党党员和中国新民主主义青年团团员约占百分之七十左右。
    在朝鲜反侵略战争中，志愿军各级政治工作机关十分重视开展立功运动。这一运动进一步发挥了指挥员战斗员及各种工作人员的革命英雄主义精神，使全军充满着战胜困难、完成任务、争取荣誉的斗争精神，保证了战斗任务的胜利完成。
    志愿军中开展的立功运动有着两个显著的特点：一个是立功运动已经成了全军中广泛的群众性的运动。“人人立功，事事立功！”已成为全军的口号。从前线到后方，从医院到运输线上，在各种人员中还都喊着一个最响亮的口号：“争取立国际功！”因此在每一个战斗或工作任务下达之后，指挥员战斗员们便纷纷订立立功计划，写保证书或决心书，展开立功竞赛。许多指挥员也积极参加了这一运动，他们常把自己的立功计划向下级指挥员和战士公布，并请战士群众作评判人，使自己的指挥艺术能不断提高。志愿军立功运动的另一个特点是集体立功的单位大量增加。战争中历次战役的胜利是各部队联合协同作战的结果，这样就要求每一个人、每一支部队必须服从总的意图，密切配合，互相支援。因此，在许多部队中，从战斗小组一直到连、营、团都订出单位的立功计划。当不同兵种的部队并肩作战时，战士们创造了“合同立功”的办法。著名的马良山反击战便是这一协同作战的范例。在这个战斗中，步兵和炮兵充分发挥了协同作战的威力，大量杀伤了敌军。
    志愿军中的各级政治工作者根据朝鲜反侵略战争的实际要求，不断充实和丰富了立功运动的内容。他们不断提出切合实际的新的口号，推动部队战胜各种困难，争取胜利。某部第五连在第五次战役中深入敌后作战。该连政治工作者就提出了爱弹药、爱粮食、爱身体、爱同志的立功口号，以鼓舞部队的斗志。战士们便积极利用敌人的武器弹药，边打仗边补充；粮食不够就上山挖野菜和粮食掺起来吃，把好粮留给随队的轻伤员吃；许多战士都坚持不喝冷水，睡觉休息时一定给身上盖好雨布。他们克服了各种困难，连续作战十次，歼敌二百多人，全连集体立了二等功。
