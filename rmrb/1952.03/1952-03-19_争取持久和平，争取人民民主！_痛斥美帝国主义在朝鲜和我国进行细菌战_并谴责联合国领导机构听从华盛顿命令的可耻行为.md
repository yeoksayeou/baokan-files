Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th. The latest issue of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" devoted nearly half of its first page to publishing the angry protests of people all over the world against the heinous crimes of American imperialism in using bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

The newspaper published an article saying: Neither Acheson nor his lackeys can cover up the crimes of the American cannibals. The truth will surely come to light. The article said: "The people of the whole world believe that the despicable American rulers who launched the evil germ warfare in Korea and China are shameful. Humanity is increasingly aware that the American imperialists are attempting to achieve their goal of dominating the world through the most evil germ warfare and at the cost of the lives of millions of people." The article commented on the silence of the United Nations Secretariat and Lie regarding the thousands of telegrams received by the United Nations demanding punishment of American criminals, saying: This "once again proves that the United Nations leadership is obeying Washington's orders." The article concluded: "The people of the world denounce the brutal acts of the American government, demand an end to the heinous crimes of the American aggressors, and severely punish the beasts in human clothing who launched germ warfare."

The newspaper also published a cartoon entitled "Washington's Plague." In this picture, a plague god, riding a huge and hideous fly, leads a large group of various kinds of insects out of the White House.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    痛斥美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战
    并谴责联合国领导机构听从华盛顿命令的可耻行为
    【新华社布拉格十八日电】最近一期“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”，在第一版几乎以一半篇幅刊载了全世界人民对美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的滔天罪行提出的愤怒的抗议。
    该报发表文章说：不论是艾奇逊或是他的狗腿子，都掩盖不了美国吃人生番的罪迹。真相必定会大白于天下。文章说：“全世界的人民都认为，在朝鲜和中国发动罪恶的细菌战争的卑劣的美国统治者是可耻的。人类愈来愈清楚地看出，美帝国主义者企图借助于万恶的细菌战，并牺牲千百万人的生命来达到他们统治世界的目的。”这篇文章评论联合国秘书处和赖伊对联合国所收到的千百件要求惩办美国罪犯的电报一声不响的情形说：这“再一次证明联合国领导机构是听从华盛顿的命令的”。文章最后说：“全世界人民都痛斥美国政府的残暴行为，要求制止美国侵略者的万恶罪行，并严惩那些发动细菌战的衣冠禽兽。”
    该报还刊载了一幅漫画，标题是“华盛顿的瘟疫”。在这幅画中，一个瘟神骑着一只巨大而丑恶的苍蝇，率领着一大群各种各样的虫子从白宫出来。
