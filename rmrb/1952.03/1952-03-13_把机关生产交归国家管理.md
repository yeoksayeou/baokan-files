    Turning Over Management of Agency Production to the State
    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued on March 12th the "Decision on Unified Handling of Agency Production." This is one of the necessary measures to consolidate the achievements of the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
    Agency production played a significant historical role in our people's revolutionary war. Before the victory of the People's Liberation War, especially during the Anti-Japanese War, the people's revolutionary bases suffered from enemy division and blockade, and material conditions were very difficult. Although the masses of people in the base areas enthusiastically handed over public grain, the amount collected was limited in order not to increase the burden on the people, and it could not solve the entire supply problem for agencies and troops. In order to ensure the supply for the revolutionary war and appropriately improve the lives of soldiers and staff, agency production, mainly based on agriculture and handicrafts, was successively organized in various revolutionary base areas, starting from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. At that time, agency production was organized in accordance with the correct policy of "doing it yourself, overcoming difficulties" formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong. In terms of management, it implemented the policy of leaders taking responsibility, doing it themselves, everyone working, striving for production, overcoming difficulties, ensuring supply, and obeying the policies and decrees of the People's Government. In terms of management, it implemented the policy of "centralized leadership, decentralized operation." These correct policies, and the military communist lifestyle of the cadres and soldiers at that time, and the objective conditions such as scattered raw materials, inconvenient transportation, and scattered labor force, were completely compatible. At that time, the organization of such agency production did indeed enhance the production enthusiasm of the broad masses, increased social material wealth, prospered rural markets, reduced the burden on the people, improved the material life of agency and troop personnel, and cultivated and improved people's labor concepts. At that time, many agencies not only fully self-sufficient in office expenses and miscellaneous expenses, but also many cadres and service personnel paid hundreds of kilograms of grain produced by themselves to the state every year. Some troops, such as the 359th Brigade stationed in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, completely relied on their own labor income to solve all their food and clothing problems. Generally speaking, agency production in this period had more advantages than disadvantages. Although some malpractices occurred in the process of operation and expenditure, our Party has continuously and promptly pointed out and corrected these malpractices.
    Since the national liberation, the situation of agency production has gradually undergone significant changes in the past three years. Due to changes in objective conditions, agency production has developed rapidly. Not only has it increased many small-scale industries, increased social wealth, and prospered certain markets, but it has also solved the difficulties of some agency cadres in terms of medical care, family life, and insufficient agency expenses, that is to say, it has continued to play some positive roles. However, from a global perspective, the result of the development of agency production has been more disadvantages than advantages. First of all, the source of funds for many agency production is not legitimate: such as "turning public into small public," not handing over budget surpluses, or falsely reporting and receiving more funds to invest in agency production. This is a violation of the Party's policies and damages the interests of the state. Secondly, there are also many problems with the management policy of agency production. For example, although many agency productions have established many small-scale industries, the main thing is no longer the agriculture and handicrafts that everyone invests in and produces through labor, but the operation of commerce by a few people in pursuit of profits; some even violate government policies and laws, engage in smuggling and tax evasion, and speculation. Again, in terms of expenses, many agencies have therefore experienced extravagance and waste, and have developed to the point of only supplying a few people in the agency to squander and waste; many directly involved personnel take the opportunity to embezzle for personal gain. In many agency production institutions, there are also many "mole"-style merchants who use all means to steal the property of small public entities, "stealing small public entities to enrich themselves." This kind of agency production is greatly contradictory to the concentration and planning necessary for our country's economic construction today. It not only corrupts many cadres, but also affects the unity among cadres due to the uneven distribution of hardships and joys between agencies and within agencies. That is to say, the decentralization, blindness, and certain destructiveness of agency production under the new conditions have been fully exposed; unified handling of agency production has become a very urgent requirement.
    Unified handling of agency production is now not only urgently needed, but also completely possible. Now our country's financial and economic strength has been greatly enhanced, and the state is fully capable of supplying the financial expenditures of agencies, troops, organizations, and schools, and can guarantee the lives of all staff. Some people are afraid that "if agency enterprises are cancelled, some problems in the agency cannot be solved." This concern is completely unfounded. Our state-owned enterprises have developed greatly, and relying on the strength of state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and uniting legitimate private enterprises can completely solve the problem of material exchange. Unified management by the state of the originally decentralized and unplanned agency production, making it a central or local state-owned enterprise, can achieve the effect of unified concentration. As for the saying that "the cancellation of agency production will affect economic construction" is also unfounded. Because now the state has the power to manage these enterprises and will manage them better than before. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the broad masses of cadres and leaders have deeply recognized the decentralization, destructiveness, and corrupting nature of agency production on cadres, and therefore have requested that all agency production be turned over to the public. This request is correct and is a favorable condition for the unified handling of agency production. Only by turning all agency production over to the public can we truly give play to the good role of agency production and overcome the malpractices caused by agency production.
    In order to solve the problem of unified management of agency production completely, thoroughly, and in an orderly manner, all agencies, troops, parties, organizations, and schools should thoroughly and conscientiously implement the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Unified Handling of Agency Production" to ensure that "complete transfer" is achieved. All units must, with a high degree of responsibility to the country and the people, hand over the funds, accounts, materials, and personnel of agency production completely and without any omissions, and listen to the unified allocation of the state. All acts of outwardly agreeing but inwardly opposing, passively resisting work, "laying ambushes," concealing materials, withdrawing funds, removing personnel, stirring up trouble, and eating and drinking extravagantly are criminal acts; if an irresponsible attitude is adopted and the matter is handed over perfunctorily, resulting in losses to production, the parties concerned will be severely punished. If it is said that problems have occurred in many agency enterprises in the past, the leading cadres of the agency should bear certain responsibility, then if they still cannot handle this matter well in this unified handling of agency production, it will be a mistake on top of a mistake and they will be severely blamed or punished.

### 把机关生产交归国家管理

    把机关生产交归国家管理
    中央人民政府政务院三月十二日发布了“关于统一处理机关生产的决定”。这是巩固反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争成果的必要措施之一。
    机关生产在我国人民革命战争中，曾经发挥了巨大的历史作用。在人民解放战争胜利以前，特别是在抗日战争时期，人民革命根据地遭受了敌人的分割和封锁，物质条件十分困难，当时根据地人民群众虽然踊跃交纳公粮，但是，为了不加重人民的负担，公粮徵收的数目很有限，并不能解决机关、部队的全部供给问题。为了保证革命战争的供应，适当地改善战士和工作人员的生活，从陕甘宁边区开始，各革命根据地相继举办了以农业和手工业为主的机关生产。当时的机关生产，是按照毛泽东同志规定的“亲自动手、克服困难”的正确方针组织起来的。在经营方面，它实行了首长负责、亲自动手，大家劳动，努力生产，克服困难，保证供给，服从人民政府政策法令的方针。在管理方面，它实行了“集中领导，分散经营”的方针。这些正确的方针，和当时的干部、战士所过的军事共产主义的生活，和当时原料分散、交通不便、劳动力分散等客观情况，是完全相适应的。当时举办这样的机关生产，确是提高了广大群众的生产积极性，增加了社会的物质财富，繁荣了农村的市场，减轻了人民的负担，改善了机关、部队人员的物质生活，并且锻炼和提高了人们的劳动观念。当时许多机关不但办公费和杂费完全自给，而且许多干部和勤杂人员，每年要向国家缴纳自己生产的几百斤粮食。有些部队，如驻防陕甘宁边区的三五九旅，完全靠自己的劳动所得，解决了自己全部的衣食问题。总的说来，这一时期的机关生产是利多弊少的。在经营和开支过程中虽然也曾发生了一些流弊，但是我们的党已不断地及时地指出和纠正了这些流弊。
    全国解放以后，三年来机关生产的情况又逐渐发生了重大的变化。由于客观条件的改变，机关生产发展很快。不但增加了许多小型工业，增加了社会财富，繁荣了某些市场，而且解决了一部分机关干部的医药、家属生活的困难和机关开支不足的问题，也就是说，继续发挥了一些积极的作用。但是，就全局而言，机关生产发展的结果，已是弊多利少了。首先，许多机关生产的资金来路不正：如
    “化大公为小公”，预算结余不上缴，或浮报多领经费，投入机关生产。这是违背党的政策，损害国家利益的。其次，机关生产的经营方针也有不少毛病。例如，许多机关生产，虽然办了很多小型工业，但主要的已经不是经营大家入股、劳动生产的农业和手工业，而是由少数人去经营商业，追逐利润的；有的甚至违反政府的政策法令，走私漏税，投机倒把。再次，在开支方面，许多机关因此发生铺张浪费现象，而且发展到只供给机关少数人员挥霍浪费；许多直接经手的人员，则乘机贪污自肥，在许多机关生产的机构中，还混入了不少“坐探”式的商人，他们利用一切手段，窃取小公的财产，“盗小公以自肥”。这种机关生产，在今天对于我们国家经济建设所必需的集中性和计划性是有很大抵触的。它不但腐蚀了许多干部，而且由于各机关之间和机关内部苦乐不均，更影响了干部之间的团结。这就是说，机关生产在新条件下的分散性、盲目性及由此而产生的某种破坏性，已经充分地暴露出来；统一处理机关生产，已经成为一个十分迫切的要求了。
    统一处理机关生产，现在不仅是迫切需要的，而且是完全可能的。现在我们国家的财政经济力量，已经大为增强，国家完全有力量供给机关、部队、团体、学校的财政开支，并可保证全体工作人员的生活。有些人害怕“取消了机关企业，机关有些问题解决不了”。这种顾虑是完全没有根据的。我们的国营企业，已有很大的发展，依靠国营企业、合作社并团结正当的私人企业的力量，完全可以解决物资交流的问题。由国家统一管理原来分散的、没有统一计划的机关生产，使之成为中央的或地方的国营企业，正可收统一集中之效。至于所谓“机关生产取消了要影响经济建设”的说法，也是没有根据的。因为现在国家有力量来管理这些企业，而且会管理得比原来更好。在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动中，广大干部和领导人员，已经深刻地认识了机关生产的分散性、破坏性及其对于干部的腐蚀性，因而纷纷要求把机关生产全部归公。这种要求是正确的，是统一处理机关生产的有利条件。也只有把机关生产全部归公，才能真正发挥机关生产的好的作用，克服机关生产所产生的弊病。
    为了完满地、彻底地、有条不紊地解决统一管理机关生产的问题，各机关、部队、党派、团体、学校应该彻底地、认真地执行政务院“关于统一处理机关生产的决定”，保证作到“完整移交”。各单位要以对国家、对人民高度负责的精神，把机关生产的资金、账目、物资和人员，完整地、一点不漏地交出来，听候国家统一支配。所有阳奉阴违、消极怠工、“打埋伏”、隐蔽物资、提取资金、抽走人员、混水摸鱼、大吃大喝等，都是犯罪行为；如有采取不负责任的态度，马虎交代了事，以致生产受到损失的，当事人都要受到严厉的处分。如果说过去许多机关企业发生了问题，该机关的领导干部要负一定的责任，那么，在这次统一处理机关生产的过程中，他们如果还不能把这件事情办好，就是错上加错，就要受到严厉的责备或处分。
