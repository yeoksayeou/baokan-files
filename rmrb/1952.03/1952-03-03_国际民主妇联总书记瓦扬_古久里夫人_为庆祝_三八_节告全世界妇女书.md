They have joined us in defending their civil rights, labor rights, and maternal rights, and in protecting their lives and the lives of their children. Women of all countries: We should turn "March 8th" into a day of demonstrations for peace and for saving the lives of our children.
    The letter to women of the world pointed out: The International Conference for the Defense of Children is scheduled to be held in Vienna from April 12th to 16th, and preparations are currently underway in various countries. During our preparations for the celebration of "March 8th", we must publicize the International Conference for the Defense of Children on a broad basis, and demand that governments increase appropriations to protect the lives, health, and education of children. We demand an immediate cessation of all hostilities in Korea and Vietnam, the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of the production of atomic weapons and the establishment of international control, and that governments increase funding to maintain the people's livelihoods, health, and cultural standards. We demand an immediate halt to the re-militarization of West Germany. We should collect millions of signatures for the World Peace Council's declaration calling for a peace pact between the five major powers. We must also support the women of Egypt and Tunisia who are fighting alongside their people for the independence of their homelands.
    The letter to women of the world concluded: Women, mothers: We bear a great responsibility. But as long as we all rise up together to overcome the dangers we feel, we will surely achieve peace.

    【新华社二日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：国际民主妇女联合会总书记瓦扬—古久里夫人，为筹备庆祝今年“三八”国际妇女节，发表告全世界妇女书说：今年，不仅国际民主妇联在六十二个国家中的一亿三千五百万会员，而且全世界各国千百万妇女也筹备庆祝“三八”节。她们已跟我们联合起来，以维护她们的公民权利、劳动权利和母性权利，维护她们和孩子们的生命。各国妇女们：我们应该把“三八”节变成为和平、为拯救我们孩子们的生命而举行示威的日子。
    告全世界妇女书指出：国际保卫儿童大会定于四月十二日到十六日在维也纳举行，目前各国正在进行筹备工作。我们在筹备庆祝“三八”节期间，必须在广大的基础上宣传关于国际保卫儿童大会的事情，并且要求各国政府增加保障儿童的生命、健康和教育的拨款。我们要求立刻停止朝鲜和越南境内的一切敌对行动，裁减军备，禁止原子武器生产并建立国际管制，要求各国政府增加经费来维持人民的生存、健康和文化水平。我们要求立即制止西德重新军国主义化。我们应该为世界和平理事会要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言征集千百万人的签名。我们也要支援正在和本国人民一道为祖国的独立而斗争的埃及和突尼斯的妇女们。
    告全世界妇女书最后说：妇女们，母亲们：我们负着重大的责任。但是，只要我们大家一致奋起克服我们感受到的危险，我们就一定会得到和平。
