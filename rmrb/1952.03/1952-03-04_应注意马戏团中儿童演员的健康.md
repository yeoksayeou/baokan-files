    Attention Should Be Paid to the Health of Child Performers in Circuses

    To the Editor: On January 8th, I saw something in Houzui Town, not far from Xinpu City, Shandong, which made me very uncomfortable. I am writing to tell you about it.

    That day, a circus came to the town, and I went to see it with other comrades. It started with a large table act. Soon, a little girl with braids walked to the table. An adult grabbed her braid, lifted her onto the table, and made her bend backward until her head touched her heels. He even made her pick up a coin with her mouth. Then, they put a stool on the table and made her climb onto it to do the same action; finally, they added another stool on top of the first one. Only after she completed the same action was she allowed to stop. While she was doing these actions, the adult said beside her, "She doesn't feel any pain." And he seemed to ask the child very affectionately, "My dear, does it hurt?" "No, it doesn't!" the child replied, but there were tears in her eyes. At this point, the adult asked the audience for money. Seeing this, I felt very uncomfortable and also very angry. I remembered a few years ago, a circus came to our hometown and performed a so-called "three hangings" act, using hooks to hang children by their braids in mid-air. Once, the child's jaw was damaged by the hook, and he died. What a cruel thing!

    Editor, disregarding the health of children and using their pain to exchange for money is an inhumane act. The children of New China have been liberated and are living and studying happily. However, the children in the circus (as far as I know, most of them are children from poor families who were bought by the circus) have not yet been liberated. They suffer pain all day long, and if they are not careful, they are in danger of losing their lives. Therefore, I hope that local governments will advise those in charge of circuses not to let children participate in performances that are harmful to their physical and mental health, and if they do not listen to the advice, they should be prohibited.

### 应注意马戏团中儿童演员的健康

    应注意马戏团中儿童演员的健康
    编辑同志：一月八日，我在离山东新浦市不远的猴嘴镇看到一件事情，这件事使我很难受，特写信来告诉你们。
    那天，镇上来了一个马戏团，我和其他同志一起去看。开始是玩的大桌子。不久，一个扎着辫子的小女孩走到桌子边，一个大人提着她的小辫子将她提到桌子上，叫她头向后弯，一直弯到脚跟，还叫她用嘴衔起铜板。接着，又在桌上放一只凳子，叫她爬上去做同样动作；最后在凳子上又加上了凳子，做完同样动作才罢休。在做这些动作的时候，大人在旁边说：“她这样是不疼的。”并且似乎很亲密地问孩子：“我的乖乖啊，你疼不疼哪！”“不疼！”孩子答着，可是孩子眼中含着泪水。这时，大人就向观众讨钱了。看到这里，我心中十分难受，也非常气愤。我想起几年前，在我们家乡有一个马戏团表演，在演出所谓“三上吊”的节目中，用钩子钩着孩子的辫子，把孩子吊到半空。有一次，这个孩子竟被钩子钩坏了下颚而送了命，这是一件多残酷的事情啊！
    编辑同志，不顾孩子的健康，用孩子的痛苦来换取金钱，这是非人道的行为。新中国的孩子已经解放了，他们愉快地在生活、学习。可是，马戏团里的孩子们（据我所知，他们绝大部分是贫苦人家的子女，被马戏团买去的），依然没有解放，他们终日受着痛苦的折磨，偶一不慎，就有丧失性命的危险。因此，我希望各地政府，劝告马戏团的负责者，不要让孩子参加有害身心健康的演出，如果不听从劝告，就予以禁止。  王保林
