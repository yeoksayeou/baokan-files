An introduction to Issue No. 130 of the Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" which was published on the 1st.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies in Peaceful Construction," and also carries the communiqué of the Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on the results of the implementation of the plan for the development of the national economy of the Soviet Union in 1951, and news of the completion of the 1951 production plan by the People's Democracies. The editorial first described the successful completion of last year's national economic plans by the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and then emphasized that the results of the implementation of the Soviet Union's plan for the development of the national economy have very important international significance. It shows that the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the great Stalin, have taken another big step towards communist society. These achievements vividly embody the ideals of Lenin and Stalin in transforming the world. Because of the Soviet Union's economic achievements and its policy of peace, it has attracted the hearts of people of all countries, thus profoundly affecting the development of world history as a whole. On the other hand, the achievements of the People's Democratic countries show how powerful the creative power of the people of all countries has become after overthrowing the reactionary ruling classes. The editorial concludes by saying that the achievements of the socialist and democratic camp in peaceful construction are a great contribution to the common cause of progressive mankind throughout the world, and to the struggle against the danger of a new war and for the freedom and independence of all peoples.

Gero, a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Working People's Party, published an article entitled "Hungary's Struggle to Complete the 1952 National Economic Plan and the Lessons of Last Year," saying that in 1951, Hungary's industry completed 103.4 percent of the expanded plan, and labor productivity increased by 14.5 percent compared with 1950. Agriculture and other sectors of the national economy also completed and overfulfilled the 1951 plan. All this proves that Hungary has taken another step forward along the road of socialist industrialization. Gero pointed out that while overfulfilling the overall plan, Hungary still lagged behind in some respects. Based on last year's experience, economic workers, party cadres and mass organization cadres must focus their attention on several basic issues that determine whether this year's plan can be successfully completed: 1. Better utilize existing means of production, industrial equipment and raw materials, and better organize the labor force; 2. Strengthen labor, financial and planned discipline; 3. Meet the manpower needs of industry, transportation and agriculture in 1952; 4. Reduce production costs; 5. Improve the economic leadership level of leading cadres.

This issue carries an article by Diaz, General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party, entitled "Struggle for the Victory of the Chilean National Liberation Movement." Diaz first analyzed the situation of the cruel exploitation of the Chilean people by American monopoly capital. He pointed out that the profits squeezed by American trusts in Chile every year are equivalent to the total annual budget of Chile. Chile's foreign trade is almost entirely monopolized by the United States. The Chilean people have become increasingly aware that they must end this vicious plunder and end the pro-American policy implemented by the government since 1947. The current political situation in Chile is characterized by: the struggle of the working people to meet their current demands is unprecedentedly high, and the mass movement against imperialism and against war is booming. The working people have united in the struggle, and the national bourgeoisie also opposes the government's pro-American policy. The Communist Party, which is in an underground state, has put forward a policy of striving for independence, progress, democracy, prosperity and peace, which has been echoed by all patriots. Chilean communists believe that they can not only win the battle against foreign imperialism and war, but also wage many victorious and decisive battles in the struggle for national independence and peace.

This issue publishes Limushan's article "The National Liberation Movement of the People of North Africa Cannot Be Strangled by Imperialists." Limushan pointed out that recently, British, American, and French imperialists have brutally suppressed the struggle of the people of the Near East, Middle East, and North Africa for national independence and peace, attempting to place them under the arbitrary rule of the "Middle East Command" in order to prepare for a new world war. However, the people of the colonies and dependent countries are taking increasingly resolute actions to defend their rights, oppose foreign enslavement, and strive for their own national liberation. The people of North Africa are increasingly aware that their struggle for national independence and their struggle to defend peace are inextricably linked. Only by uniting and participating in a united front, and struggling against the conspiracy of American imperialism to launch a new world war and its ambition to "dominate the world," can the people of all dependent countries win independence and control their own destiny.

This issue also published Grigoriev, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party's "Marxist-Leninist Education of the Bulgarian Communist Party"; Mattern, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party's "Results of the German Socialist Unity Party's Review of Members and Candidate Members," and other articles.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三○期介绍
    共产党与工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三○期已在一日出版。
    本期发表了题为“苏联和人民民主国家在和平建设上的成就”的社论，并刊载了苏联部长会议中央统计局关于苏联一九五一年发展国民经济计划执行结果的公报，和人民民主国家完成一九五一年生产计划的消息。社论首先叙述了苏联和各人民民主国家胜利完成去年国民经济计划的情况，接着强调指出：苏联发展国民经济计划的执行结果，是有非常重大的国际意义的。它说明了苏联人民在共产党和伟大斯大林领导之下，又向共产主义社会迈进了一大步。这些成就生动地体现了列宁—斯大林的改造世界的理想。由于苏联的经济成就和它的和平政策，它吸引了各国人民的心灵，从而深刻地影响了整个世界历史的发展。另一方面，人民民主国家的成就，说明了各国人民在推翻了反动统治阶级以后，他们所发挥出来的创造性力量，是多么的强大。社论最后说：社会主义和民主阵营在和平建设方面的成就，对于全世界进步人类的共同事业，对于反对新战争危险、争取各国人民的自由和独立，是一个伟大的贡献。
    匈牙利劳动人民党政治局委员格罗，以“匈牙利为完成一九五二年国民经济计划的斗争与去年的教训”为题发表文章说：在一九五一年，匈牙利的工业完成了扩大后的计划的百分之一○三·四，劳动生产率比一九五○年提高了百分之十四·五。农业和国民经济其他部门也完成了和超额完成了一九五一年的计划。这一切证明了匈牙利已沿着社会主义工业化的道路又前进了一步。格罗指出：在超额完成整个计划的时候，匈牙利在若干方面还是落后的。根据去年的经验，必须使经济工作人员、党的干部和群众组织的干部，把注意力集中到决定今年计划能否胜利完成的几个基本问题上：一、更好地利用现有的生产工具、工业装备和原料，更好地组织劳动力；二、加强劳动、财政和计划性的纪律；三、满足一九五二年工业、运输业和农业在人力上的需要；四、减低生产成本；五、提高领导干部的经济领导水平。
    本期刊载了智利共产党总书记迪亚斯的“为智利民族解放运动的胜利而斗争”一文。迪亚斯首先分析了美国垄断资本残酷剥削智利人民的情况，他指出：每年美国托辣斯在智利榨取的利润，相当于智利全年的预算总额。智利的对外贸易几乎全部为美国垄断。智利人民已经日益觉悟到必须结束这种恶毒的掠夺，结束政府在一九四七年以来所实行的亲美政策。目前智利的政治局势的特点是：劳动人民争取满足当前要求的斗争正空前高涨，反对帝国主义和反对战争的群众运动正蓬勃发展。劳动人民已在斗争中团结起来，民族资产阶级也反对政府的亲美政策。处在地下状态的共产党所提出的争取独立、进步、民主、繁荣与和平的政策，得到了所有爱国者的响应。智利共产党人相信：他们不仅能够赢得反对外国帝国主义和战争的战斗，而且也能够在争取民族独立与和平的斗争中，进行许多胜利的决定性的战斗。
    本期发表了立穆善的“北非人民的民族解放运动是帝国主义者绞杀不了的”一文。立穆善指出：近来，英、美、法帝国主义者残暴地镇压近东、中东和北非人民争取民族独立与和平的斗争，企图把他们置于“中东司令部”的专横统治下，以便准备新的世界大战。但是，殖民地和附属国的人民正在采取日益坚决的行动来保卫自己的权利，反对外国的奴役，争取自己民族的解放。北非人民愈来愈清楚地认识到，他们争取民族独立的斗争和保卫和平的斗争，是不可分割地联系在一起的。各附属国人民只有团结起来，参加统一战线，为反对美帝国主义发动新世界大战的阴谋和“独霸世界”的野心而斗争，才能够赢得独立，把他们的命运掌握在自己的手里。
    本期还发表了保加利亚共产党中央委员会宣传鼓动部部长葛里哥洛夫的“保加利亚共产党的马克思—列宁主义教育”；德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员马吞的“德国统一社会党审查党员和候补党员的结果”等文章。（新华社）
