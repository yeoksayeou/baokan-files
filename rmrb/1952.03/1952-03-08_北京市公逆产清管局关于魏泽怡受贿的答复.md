    Beijing Public Confiscated Property Management Bureau's Reply Regarding Wei Zeyi's Bribery
    To the Editor: On January 21st, the People's Daily published a report from workers at the Gui Xiang Cun Food Store, exposing the capitalist's concealment of shares of traitorous property and our bureau cadre Wei Zeyi's acceptance of bribes. We thank the workers for this report. We now report on the handling of the situation as follows:
    After Japan's surrender, the capitalist of Gui Xiang Cun Food Store – the traitor Zhou Dawen – was arrested. His son, Zhou Ximing, colluded with other capitalists to change Zhou's original one-half share of the equity to one-quarter. After our bureau took over the supervision of these traitorous properties, we dispatched Wei Zeyi and others to handle it. They conducted a review based on the already altered false accounts and did not conduct in-depth investigation and research. As a result, one-quarter of the traitorous shares were concealed. During the anti-corruption campaign, Wei Zeyi had already confessed to accepting bribes from various liquidated units, including borrowing money from the Gui Xiang Cun Food Store. When handling this matter, we lacked vigilance and were very numb ideologically. We are now thoroughly examining all units that have been liquidated by our bureau. The errors committed by Wei Zeyi and his embezzlement are still under investigation. We also hope that the general public will assist us in recovering the escaped traitorous property. Our bureau has sent a letter to the Municipal People's Court regarding the concealment of traitorous shares, requesting investigation and handling.

    北京市公逆产清管局关于魏泽怡受贿的答复
    编辑同志：一月二十一日，人民日报刊登了桂香村食品店工人检举资方隐匿逆股及我局干部魏泽怡受贿等情形。我们感谢工人这个检举。现在我们把处理情况报告如下：
    日本投降后，桂香村食品店资方——汉奸周大文被捕。其子周锡铭串通其他资方，把周逆名下二分之一的股权改为四分之一。我局监管这些逆产以后，即派魏泽怡等前往处理。他们根据已改的假账，进行审查，并未深入调查研究，因之四分之一的逆股就被隐匿了。在反贪污运动中，魏泽怡已坦白了曾接受各被清算事业单位的贿赂，包括向桂香村食品店借钱等在内。处理这件事的时候，我们缺乏警惕性，在思想上非常麻痹。我们现正彻底检查曾经我局清算过的各单位。关于魏泽怡所犯错误及其贪污问题，我们仍在追查中。我们还希望广大市民协助我们，以追回逃掉的逆产。我局已把隐匿逆股的情况，函请市人民法院追究处理。
