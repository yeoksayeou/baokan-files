The Growth of a Collective Farm
By our correspondent Tian Liu

Here, on the North Manchurian prairie, once known as "Great Northern Wilderness" a few years ago, I saw a new, happy life. On the land of our great motherland, collective farms have begun to appear.

This collective farm is located on the south bank of the Songhua River, forty miles east of Jiamusi City. It is the Ninth Farm of the Songjiang Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm. Although the other eight farms have collective farming groups of varying sizes, they are not fully collectivized. Because this farm was newly established last year, people call it "New Farm."

I arrived at this collective farm on the morning of February 19th. Because the chairman of the farm, Comrade Jin Baishan, had gone to the other farms to negotiate with many farmers who wanted to join this collective farm, only the vice-chairman and the finance and grain committee members were at the farm. The farm members were busily and happily threshing rice in the threshing ground. The vice-chairman of the farm told me: "Last autumn, it rained continuously for more than fifty days, and the rice 'stayed green,' maturing late. The harvest was not completed until November, and the threshing work was also delayed. The farm members are now working hard to catch up."

The "rumbling" electric sheller divided the threshing ground into two parts: On this side, more than a dozen people were carrying bundles of rice from the mountain-like piles of rice stalks to the threshing machine. Several others untied the bundles and passed them to the people operating the threshing machine. The rice stalks, laden with grains, had just been placed on the threshing machine when the grains fell onto the clean ground like a summer rain. On the other side, people were constantly pushing the rice, which was rapidly piling up under the threshing machine, to the center of the threshing ground with wooden shovels. The large pile of grain in the center of the field was already more than a person tall. Five or six farm members stood on the grain pile; more people stood beside it, some pushing, some sweeping, some loading carts. This is truly a picture of a bountiful harvest.

This is the harvest of the first year since the establishment of this collective farm. This year, each labor force has cultivated an average of 2.5 hectares of land; the entire farm of 99 hectares has achieved a high yield of 8,430 catties of rice per hectare.

The Road Traveled

The members of this collective farm are now living a happy life of abundance. In 1951, the personal income of a full labor force farm member was at least 9,500 catties of rice, and the highest reached more than 14,000 catties. Including their families, each person had a high income of approximately 2,500 to 3,300 catties of rice. The collective farm has established huge public property: They already have twenty-eight weeding machines, eight threshing machines, five row seeders, and many other machines. They have built a rice mill with four electric rice milling machines, five electric motors, one internal combustion engine, and an iron factory. They also have forty-six head of oxen and ten Berkshire breeding pigs.

How was this collective farm established?

Jin Baishan, the chairman of the farm, and Shen Zicheng, the leader of the production team—the two earliest initiators of the collective farm—told me: "We were originally penniless farmers who came to the farm in the spring of 1948. Because the land, houses, and even our own food were supplied or loaned by the state, we organized mutual aid groups under the leadership of the farm. But the first year was a complete failure..."

I already knew this situation from the farm headquarters: As early as 1947, in order to open up a path to unlimited happiness for farmers who had been freed from the shackles of the feudal land system, the Party and the People's Government decided to establish a model farm on the prairie east of Jiamusi City—the Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm. It would absorb nearby farmers to participate in farm cultivation, with the state providing land, houses, and machinery, so that farmers could recognize the benefits of collective labor, mechanized cultivation, and large-scale agricultural production from their own personal experience, thereby consciously and voluntarily moving towards a collective agricultural economy. At that time, the farm cadres lacked experience, and they simply used coercive methods to form the farmers into cultivation groups of "four households each," allocated a piece of land to each group according to their labor force, and began the first year of production. Facts have proved that the farmers could not immediately abandon their traditional and strong private ownership concepts simply because they were cultivating on state land. Many groups, like the rural areas undergoing land reform at the time, "evenly divided" the land supplied by the farm for the common use of the group, giving each person a share. Those cultivation groups that did not "evenly divide" the state land pushed and dragged each other when working, shirking and loafing; when it came to distributing the harvest in the fall, they fought and scrambled. Although they were "organized" in form, they did not play a role in mutual assistance. The chairman of the farm recalled the situation that year: "It was a complete mess. No one wanted to do more work, and everyone wanted to divide more. Some people would reluctantly do a little when the cadres were around; as soon as the cadres turned around, they would squat on the edge of the field smoking and chatting idly." The production performance that year was very poor. Each labor force cultivated an average of only one hectare of land, and although the rainfall was favorable, each hectare yielded only 4,729 catties of rice. The cultivation group formed by Jin Baishan, Shen Zicheng, and other four households, like other groups, had no rules or work point recording system. They usually worked in a muddle-headed way, and in the fall they casually "divided" the harvested grain "equally among each person."

Failure is often the prelude to success. Both the farm cadres and the farmers learned beneficial lessons from the practice of 1948. The Party organization of the farm, in response to the prevalent selfish petty-bourgeois ideology and the absolutely equalitarian agricultural socialist ideology among the farmers, strengthened the Party's educational work among the farmers and strengthened the Party's political work among the farmers. The farm's administrative side, when organizing farmers' labor, adhered to the principle of "voluntary and mutually beneficial." In 1949, three forms of labor appeared in the Chuan Water Conservancy Farm: A few backward farmers, believing that "too many cooks spoil the broth," "voluntarily" did not participate in mutual aid groups and went to the farm to claim a piece of land and "work independently." The vast majority of farmers formed small mutual aid groups of three, four, five, or six households by finding partners voluntarily. The advanced elements among the farmers organized cultivation teams of an agricultural cooperative nature. The predecessor of the collective farm—the Fifth Group of Jin Baishan and Shen Zicheng of the Third Farm—was one of the best of the aforementioned last type of group at that time.

Jin Baishan was the production committee member of the Third Farm. After coming to the farm, under the education of the Party, his thinking progressed rapidly, and his level of awareness increased day by day. In the propaganda and education of the Party and farm cadres, he began to understand that only the realization of collectivized agriculture could truly lead farmers to a happy life. Therefore, when he organized the Fifth Group in 1949, he advocated organizing a collectivized cultivation group, where everyone would work together on the land allocated by the farm for use, and the harvest would be distributed according to labor in the fall. The farmers did not agree with his opinion. Most people advocated "separating" the land according to the population of each household, but without demarcating boundaries or designating plots, each household would simply have a "quantity" of land, and grain would be distributed according to the land in the fall, with wages compensating those who worked more and those who worked less. At that time, although Jin Baishan said that this was unreasonable, he had no choice but to temporarily accommodate it since everyone wanted to do it that way. This year, because the group members were all like-minded people, and there was a system of work point recording, and everyone held meetings to make democratic decisions, the group members were in high spirits for production. Although they suffered a serious pest infestation, they still harvested an average of 4,800 catties per hectare in the fall; those who were not affected by the disaster reached a yield of 6,400 catties of rice, exceeding all other groups. Labor efficiency also improved, and the land cultivated by each labor force increased from one hectare in the previous year to 1.78 hectares. Their group was selected as the model group of the Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm.

The members of the Fifth Group, in their own experience, recognized the benefits of not dividing plots or demarcating boundaries. Shen Zicheng said: "This way, there is no favoritism when working, and there are no contradictions about whether your planting is early or my harvesting is late. If there are disasters on one or two pieces of land, it will not fall on one family alone to bear." They also realized two major shortcomings of the method this year: First, families with a small population but strong labor force suffered. Like Jin Baishan, he only had two people in his family, so he could only be allocated the "quantity" of land for two people. But both he and his wife were good laborers, and they worked more than forty extra workdays a year, only receiving 800 catties of rice in wages; if grain were distributed according to workdays instead of land, he could have received 1,400 catties. It can be seen that there is exploitation in this organizational form. Especially on the farm, the land belongs to the state, and it is even more unreasonable to exploit other people's labor with state land. Second, with only five households organized together, there were too few people; during the busy farming season, they were often unable to attend to everything. For example, after the rice was in the filling stage, flocks of wild ducks often flew into the rice paddies to damage the crops. With few people in the group, and the land not connected into a single piece, it took several people to watch the ducks, which delayed other work. If the group was larger and had more people, this contradiction would be resolved. Therefore, the entire group decided to change to a collectivized cultivation group in the second year, distributing the harvest entirely according to workdays, and to expand the group.

The farmers of the Third Farm had seen with their own eyes that the crops harvested by the Fifth Group led by Jin Baishan and Shen Zicheng were so abundant, and the cadres were leading so well, that they had long been very envious. When they heard that the Fifth Group was accepting new members, everyone rushed to participate. In 1950, a collectivized cultivation group including fourteen households was formed. As the group expanded, and the distribution system of "to each according to his work" was implemented, the group members' enthusiasm for labor was very high, and the benefits of collective labor became more and more obvious day by day. With more people, they could divide the work according to each person's strengths, "those who can control the wind control the wind, those who can control the rain control the rain," and labor efficiency was high. When there was urgent farm work, there was a shock force. For example, when insect pests were found on seven hectares of rice paddies in the group that year, all the men, women, and children of the group worked together to eliminate the insects at once, preventing a disaster. This year, the area cultivated by each labor force increased to 1.8 hectares, and the yield reached 6,880 catties of rice per hectare, which was the highest yield in the entire farm, 2,800 catties more per hectare than individual households, 2,000 catties more than mutual aid groups, and 800 catties more per hectare than agricultural cooperatives or small-scale collectivized cultivation groups. At this time, the Fifth Group became the target of mass discussion. The farmers envied it endlessly and asked to join. The Fifth Group expanded to thirty-six households at once. The farm leadership saw that the time was ripe and invested 180 million yuan to build the "New Farm" for them. Thus, in February 1951, the first collective farm of the Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm was born.

Economic benefits alone, the improvement of material life alone, cannot guarantee the smooth establishment of collective farms, and even if they are established, they are not easy to develop and cannot be consolidated. Transforming from a personal economy to a collective economy, from a farmer engaged in small private production to a member of a collective farm, is a huge transformation. It requires not only fighting against external obstacles and difficulties, but also fighting against the farmers' own traditional private ownership concepts. Shen Zicheng told me this story: In early 1951, when the Fifth Cultivation Group was about to develop into a collective farm, many farmers, even Jiang Dongxun, who had never believed that collective production would bring any benefits to farmers, were asking to join the collective farm, but an old member of the Fifth Group withdrew instead. This farmer did not realize that the collective farm system is the only correct path to thoroughly liberate farmers, allowing all farmers to forever get rid of poverty and achieve an increasingly happy life. He regarded it as a temporary place to get rich together. This farmer's name was Hong Rinan. After three years of collective labor, he had an ox, a cart, and had accumulated more than 3,000 catties of rice. He said: "I can live on my own now." So, he drove his large ox cart to the north of the Songhua River to "create his own happy life." He cultivated two and a half hectares of land on the prairie, working like an ox until autumn; unfortunately, a flood washed everything away, and he didn't even recover the seeds. People always have to eat. He had no choice but to sell his ox. By winter, he couldn't even afford cotton clothes and lived every day by breaking ice on the Songhua River to catch fish.

I asked farm member Li Cheng Lin: "What has the collective farm given to the farmers?" He said: "How can that be said clearly?" He spoke of his grandfather's poverty to today's abundance, and from his family to the families of other farm members—yes, how can it be said clearly? The collective farm will give the farmers everything. The road traveled by this collective farm has proven to the farmers that from mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives to collective farms, is the only correct direction for farmers to move towards a happy and civilized life.

The Party – The Organizer of the Collective Farm

The Communist Party is the organizer of the collective farm. Every achievement of this collective farm is inseparable from the Party's tremendous political and educational work among the farmers, and inseparable from the selfless labor and exemplary actions of the Party members.

Farmers enslaved under the feudal land system had dreamed for thousands of years of having a small piece of land and an ox. In order to overcome this "working alone" mentality of the farmers, from the time the Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm began to be established in 1948, the Party carried out extensive political work among the farmers: establishing winter schools, running training classes, and using various gatherings to publicize the benefits of organized cooperative production to the masses of farmers, to publicize the unparalleled superiority of large-scale agricultural production using machinery; to publicize the infinitely beautiful future of socialism and communism; so that farmers could recognize the path they should choose from the laws of social development.

The Party called on the Party members in the countryside and the advanced farmers who were around the Party to unite and educate the farmers with their own exemplary behavior and specific help to the farmers, in order to gradually guide them towards the path of production cooperation. Jiang Jingxiao joined the collective farm under the specific help and brotherly care of Party member Comrade Jin Baishan. When Jiang Jingxiao came to the farm in 1948, although he nominally participated in the joint cultivation group, he was actually working alone. That year, he worked very hard, but because he didn't know how to plan, and sometimes even if he made a plan, he couldn't implement it because he was working alone, his production was very poor that year. In the summer, he couldn't even afford a pair of trousers, so he wore a torn burlap sack around his waist and hid and dodged all summer. Comrade Jin Baishan helped him plan his life well, exchanging the harvested rice for millet, corn, and other coarse grains to prepare for the next year's food. Jiang Jingxiao was very moved, and from then on, he joined Comrade Jin Baishan's agricultural production cooperative—a semi-collectivized cultivation group. Now, Jiang Jingxiao has become one of the best members of the collective farm.

Farmers are the most practical people. Only when they actually see that collective cultivation can bring them more benefits will they believe in it, support it, and participate in it. Party members taking the lead and first setting an example for the farmers is a very important method of organizing farmers for mutual aid and cooperation and guiding them towards collectivization. Jiang Dongxun participated in the collective farm in this way. In 1948, he was assigned to a joint cultivation group composed of four households, just like other farmers. The situation in the group made him certain that "three monks have no water to drink" was an unshakeable "truth." He said at that time: "Even brothers will argue, how can farmers who don't know each other cultivate together!" The farm allowed farmers to voluntarily organize cultivation groups in the second year, so he "voluntarily" went back to his old ways: claiming five hectares of land from the farm and working alone. He, his wife, and his sixteen-year-old son all went to the fields. He saw those mutual aid groups that had made some progress but were still somewhat lazy and smiled: "Let's see the harvest in the fall!" That year, his hard work did not go to waste, and he harvested 5,200 catties of rice per hectare; except for being worse than Jin Baishan's Fifth Group, he had a higher yield than any mutual aid group in the entire farm. The bountiful harvest enriched Jiang Dongxun's life, and he bought a large ox and a large cart. He thought: "I can live even better now." However, things were not as wonderful as he thought. The ox plowed the land, pulled the cart, and transported things for him; he also had to prepare grass and water for the ox. Going to feed the ox would delay planting, and going to plant would prevent him from taking care of the ox. He had no choice but to leave his wife at home, unable to go to the fields. Looking at Jin Baishan's collectivized cultivation group, those who planted planted, those who fed the oxen fed the oxen, and they did everything ahead of him without rushing. This year, Jiang Dongxun harvested 4,800 catties per hectare, a decrease of 400 catties compared to the previous year. Jin Baishan's collectivized cultivation group harvested 6,880 catties per hectare, an increase of more than 2,000 catties compared to the previous year. At this time, he began to believe that collective production was much better than working alone, and he began to believe that the words of the farm cadres, who repeatedly publicized that "only collective agriculture can give farmers the greatest benefits," were not lies. Therefore, when Jin Baishan and others initiated the organization of the collective farm, he was the first to sign up to participate.

The selfless work and exemplary labor attitude of Party members are a huge driving force to encourage the farm members to move forward. Branch Secretary Li Zaigen and Farm Chairman Jin Baishan are two very good Party cadres. Comrade Li Zaigen is good at relying on the masses, uniting the masses, and works conscientiously and responsibly. When the collective farm was first established last spring, he led the masses to build the farm village despite his illness, completed the task ahead of schedule, and was elected by the farm members as a representative to attend the 1952 Northeast China Labor Model Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. Comrade Jin Baishan considers issues carefully and leads all the farm members in production work in an orderly manner, so that the 99 hectares of rice paddies in the entire farm have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average harvest of 8,430 catties per hectare. This large-scale, high-yield production in the entire farm is the highest record not only in the Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm but also in the entire Songjiang Province. Therefore, the farm members elected him to participate in the 1951 Songjiang Province Labor Model Congress and was rated as one of the provincial model cadres.

In all aspects of the collective farm's life, especially in production and labor, there are many exemplary behaviors and selfless labor examples of Party members. Comrade Sun Jingdao, a Communist Party member, has been continuously selected as a labor model of the farm and the province since 1948. After the collective farm was established in 1951, he was elected by the farm members as the farm's production committee member. He not only led the three production teams of the entire farm and cultivated the land very well, ensuring the bumper harvest of rice paddies; but also never delayed participating in field labor because of his work. He put all his work, such as attending meetings, planning work, organizing the labor accounts of the farm members, etc., in the evenings after labor. In any public labor of the farm, he did more and better than others. Last fall, the farm bought ten Berkshire breeding pigs. Because the farm members adhered to the old breeding methods and because they were tired from field labor, many people were unwilling to participate in the labor of building pig houses. He took the lead, first started building pig houses, and drove the farm members to participate as well. His selfless hard work has established a glorious example among the masses. When the farm members talk about their production committee members, they all sincerely support and admire him: "Sun Jingdao is responsible for so much work, and he works more workdays than anyone else." In 1951, he worked a total of 268 workdays, the highest in the entire farm.

The process of establishing, developing, and consolidating the collective farm is also a process of overcoming the small farmer mentality and private ownership concepts. According to the experience of Li Zaigen, the secretary of the farm branch, this kind of education for farmers is not only necessary in the early stages of moving towards collectivization, but also very important after the collective farm is established. He said: "This is a long-term task."

In September 1951, after most of the farm members had already had two years of collectivized agricultural economic life, the following incident still occurred: With the help of a state loan, the collective farm purchased forty-six head of oxen. When the farm members discussed how to use and raise the oxen, many people advocated distributing the oxen to each household, "wanting to tie a large ox in front of their own door." Of course, this is a manifestation of the farmers' private ownership concept, which is inconsistent with the principle of public ownership of the collective farm's oxen. The Party organization of the farm explained the harm of doing so from various aspects and influenced and persuaded the masses through the exemplary actions of Party members who did not want oxen. Later facts proved that it was more beneficial for the oxen to belong to the farm publicly than to belong to the farm members individually: When feeding, two or three people could take care of all the oxen; the efficiency when cultivating was much higher than that of privately owned oxen. Now, the farm members all say: "It's better for the oxen to belong to the entire farm. Otherwise, you can't take care of both feeding the oxen and going to the fields, it takes more work!"

Along with carrying out extensive political work, the close concern and economic assistance given to the farmers by the Party and the People's Government are also important factors in making the collective farm develop rapidly and become increasingly consolidated. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the People's Government has given the farmers who moved to the farm, especially the farmers who organized to carry out collectivized production in collective farms, frequent concern and tremendous assistance over the past few years. In addition to supplying land and houses like to the general farmers who moved to the farm, it also gave a large number of loans. In 1951 alone, the state loaned 180 million yuan to the collective farm, built new houses for all the farm members, and purchased more than forty head of oxen and many farm tools.

The New Type of Farmer

The Party led the farmers to create a happy new life, and also nurtured new farmers. Loving labor, loving the collective, cherishing public property, and loving our great motherland have begun to become new characteristics of the members of the collective farm.

In the old society, in the villages of the feudal era where people exploited people, there was a saying circulating among the farmers: "One monk carries water to drink, two monks carry water to lift, three monks have no water to drink." - With so many people in the collective farm, how do they live together?

The members of this collective farm live very well. Not only has the situation of "three monks having no water to drink" not occurred, but they have also turned the collective farm into a large family of farmer unity and friendship. When the chairman of the farm talked about the labor situation of the farm members, he said: "Labor is out of consciousness, and the farm members do not slack off or slip in production." This collective farm has developed step by step on the basis of exchanging labor and mutual assistance and agricultural cooperatives; it is the farmers who, from their own personal experience, recognized that collective labor would bring them a happier life, and consciously and voluntarily organized. The farm members know that the better they work in collective production, the more abundant their lives will be; the stronger their farm, the more their interests will increase. Therefore, every farm member regards the affairs of the collective farm as their own affairs.

In the busy threshing ground, an old farm member with scars on his face is working hard beside the electric threshing machine. This is Jiang Dongxun, who had been working alone since he moved to the Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm in 1948, and only joined the collective farm when it was established last year. Not long ago, when he was threshing grain with the threshing machine, he accidentally let the rope tied to the rice stalks on his hand get caught in the threshing machine. The threshing machine threw him from this side to the other side very far away. He suffered very serious injuries: his face and eyes were broken, and his arm was unable to move. The farm management committee, in accordance with the farm's regulations, allowed him to rest for five days and still calculated his labor days. However, on the third day, Jiang Dongxun came to the threshing ground again. The farm members all persuaded him to go back to rest, and the farm chairman also criticized him for not neglecting his body. He thanked everyone for their concern, but insisted on his own opinion: "Being bored is more uncomfortable than the pain. I can't stay at home, let me do some light work!" So he stood beside the "rumbling" threshing machine again.

Last summer, after the rice paddies had been weeded for the last time, the farm members used this short "slack farming" time to turn to the intense labor of cutting grass, gathering firewood, and building the school building of this farm. The rice stalks, which had been carefully cultivated by the farm members, were growing very fast under the warm summer sunshine. In a few days, the fragrance of rice flowers wafted in the prairie breeze. Jiang Jingxiao, who was cutting grass and gathering firewood on the prairie, smelled the refreshing fragrance and thought of the ripening rice: "It's time for the wild ducks to damage the rice paddies again." The next morning, at the crack of dawn, Jiang Jingxiao went to the rice paddies to check by himself without telling anyone. Sure enough, flocks of wild ducks were "giggling" and "yelling" noisily in the rice paddies, swallowing rice spikes in strings. Jiang Jingxiao fought with the wild ducks: he scared away the east group, then went to disperse the west group, drove away the north group, and then chased the south group. When he finished driving away the wild ducks and went home for breakfast, he was covered in sweat and exhausted. But he didn't say a word, and after eating breakfast, he went to the prairie to cut firewood with the people in the production team as usual. The next morning, he went to the rice paddies early again. There were more wild ducks, and Jiang Jingxiao drove them away even more fiercely. As the rice ripened, the wild ducks became more and more rampant every day, and it was difficult for one person to cope with the wild duck groups that flew here and fell there. The third morning, after returning from the rice paddies, Jiang Jingxiao had to report the serious duck damage to the farm chairman. The farm chairman immediately accepted his suggestion and strengthened the prevention of damage to the rice paddies.

Cherishing public property and the interests of the entire farm as meticulously as one cherishes oneself has become a new moral standard for the farm members. After the work ends in the evening, there are always many people who automatically stay behind to sweep the threshing ground and tidy up every farm tool properly. Zheng Qiuxing, the farm member who knows about mechanical and electrical engineering and has only one hand, went to Jiamusi City to buy parts for the rice milling machine, traveling eighty miles back and forth. Without resting after returning, he installed the electric rice milling machine overnight. There are endless such things to say. "Everyone for everyone, everyone for everyone," new qualities of loving labor, loving the collective, and cherishing public property can be found on any farm member.

Under the education and care of the Party and the People's Government, the farmers of the collective farm, who have obtained an abundant life and embarked on the road to the happiest life for mankind, love our great motherland. They say: "Only in such a country can our farmers be happy." In June 1951, when the General Association to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea called on the people of the country to increase production and donate airplanes and artillery to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, the members of the collective farm decided to increase production by 70 catties of rice and 500 catties of rice straw per hectare to donate to the Volunteers. After the autumn harvest, they donated a total of 7,000 catties of rice and 50,000 catties of rice straw. The female farm members also donated a large 300-catty fat pig and 143 grass sacks from their sideline income. The farm members know that their happy life is protected by the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, and they usually do a very good job of giving preferential treatment to military families. During the Spring Festival, the farm members used 54 catties of pork to comfort the military families of the Third Farm—their "hometown"; and used 36 catties of pork to comfort the nine military families of this farm. They also wrote congratulatory letters to all the military families in the Huachuan Water Conservancy Farm.

When I was interviewing at the collective farm, I stayed at the home of farm member Shen Zicheng. Whenever we ate, he would talk about the poor life in the past. Once I interrupted and talked to him about the present life. We talked a lot, very lively. Finally, looking at the hot rice in his bowl, he said in a conclusive tone: "This is all given by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!"

In 1949, when Comrade Jin Baishan organized a collectivized cultivation group, he did not agree and insisted on distributing grain according to land; now, he said: "Now you see, as long as Chairman Mao and the People's Government make a call, none of our farm members will not follow immediately."

New farmers have new lifestyles. The farm has a good democratic management system and a conscious discipline. These new types of farmers have begun to master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism as a driving force for their progress.

In late February, the chairman of the collective farm held farm member meetings for several consecutive nights, reporting to the farm members the situation of the farmers in the nearby rural areas asking to join the collective farm, and asking the farm member meeting to discuss and approve it. The matter of absorbing new farm members is greatly related to the development and consolidation of the collective farm, and it must be discussed and approved by the farm member meeting before it can be implemented. No individual can make decisions on their own. The farm member meeting is the highest authority of the collective farm. It elects the chairman of the collective farm and the members of the management committee, discusses and approves the farm's production plan; formulates the farm members' work standards and work remuneration; reviews the farm's financial expenditures and approves the budget; listens to the work reports of the management committee and the chairman and summarizes them, and so on. In short, all important matters in the collective farm must be discussed and approved by the farm member meeting before they can be implemented. The charter of this collective farm stipulates that a farm member meeting must be held at the end and beginning of each agricultural season to listen to the work summary of the previous season and the work plan for the next season. Because the collective farm was established not long ago, all aspects of work are in the initial stage, and there are especially many issues that need to be discussed and decided by the farm members. In 1951, a total of more than 30 farm member meetings were held, with a farm member meeting held every ten days on average.

The management committee is the daily working organ that implements the resolutions of the farm member meeting. The management committee has a chairman, vice-chairman, production committee member, cultural and educational committee member, financial and grain accounting committee member, etc., who are responsible for managing daily work with division of labor. The chairman, vice-chairman, and financial and grain committee members are separated from production and do not participate in field labor; their remuneration is calculated according to the labor days of medium labor force, and they get the deserved remuneration according to the "value" of the labor days in the fall, just like the farm members. In a collective farm of thirty-six households, are three staff members separated from production too many? After detailed interviews, it is known that this is not too many. In the collective farm, the things that each farmer needed to prepare and arrange on their own in the past, such as preparing farm tools, seeds, feeding oxen, paying public grain, etc., are all managed centrally by the management committee. No wonder the farm members always boast when talking about their free and unrestrained new life: "When you come back from the fields, you can rest if you want to rest, and you can read if you want to read, whatever you want, and no trivial matters will bother you." If you calculate the time spent by thirty-six individual farmers in this regard, it is much more than three people. Of course, with the development of the collective farm and the progress of work, the professional cadres who are separated from production can still be reduced. In 1952, after the collective farm expanded from the original thirty-six households to sixty households, there were still three professional cadres, and no increase.

Because all important matters in the farm are discussed and decided by the farm members, and because the farm's cadres are directly elected by the farm members, the farm members regard the farm's affairs as their own affairs, and they automatically and voluntarily work for the work of the entire farm. Even when individual farm members violate resolutions, not only will the cadres of the management committee advise him, but the farm members will also criticize him. For example, last spring, the farm members had already decided that the production committee member would ring the bell as a signal when going to the fields; but female farm member Cui Mingshu was always late, and sometimes the production committee member would have to go to her house to call her before she would come. After the farm members criticized her, she corrected herself. Now, the system and discipline in work are no longer felt by the farm members to be restrictive, but have become their habit of life and work.

    一个集体农庄的成长
    本报记者  田流
    这里是在几年前还被人叫作“北大荒”的北满草原。就在这北满草原上，我看到了一种新的幸福的生活。在我们伟大祖国的土地上，已经开始出现集体农庄了。
    这个集体农庄在松花江南岸，佳木斯市以东四十里的草原上，是松江桦川水利农场的第九农庄。其他八个农庄虽然都有或大或小的集体化耕作组，但还不是全庄集体化。因为这个农庄是去年新建立起来的，人们都叫它“新庄”。
    我在二月十九日上午到达这个集体农庄。因为其他农庄有许多农民都要求参加这个集体农庄，农庄主席金白山同志到各庄接洽去了，只有副主席和财粮委员在庄里。庄员们正在打谷场上紧张、愉快地进行稻谷脱粒工作。农庄副主席告诉我：“去年秋天，接连下了五十多天的秋雨，稻子‘贪青’，熟得晚，十一月才收割完毕，脱谷工作也推迟了。现在庄员们正紧张突击。”
    “轰轰”转动的电力脱壳机，把一个打谷场分成了两部分：这一边有十几个人从小山一样的禾堆上，把一捆捆稻子运到脱谷机旁，另几个人把稻捆解开，转递给在脱谷机上操作的人。籽粒累累的稻禾，刚放到脱谷机上，稻粒就像夏日的暴雨样“刷刷”地落到明净的场地上了。那一边正有人不停地把脱谷机下迅速堆高起来的稻谷用木锨推到打谷场中央去——场中央的大谷堆已经堆积得有一人多高了。五六个庄员站在谷堆上；更多的人站在谷堆旁，有的推，有的扫，有的装车。这真是一幅丰收的图画。
    这是这个集体农庄成立的第一年的收获。这一年每个劳动力已经平均耕种二点五公顷土地；全庄九十九公顷土地，平均达到每公顷八千四百三十斤稻谷的高额产量。
    走过的道路
    这个集体农庄的庄员们，现在都过着丰衣足食的幸福生活。一个整劳动力的庄员的个人收入，一九五一年，最低的有九千五百斤稻谷，最高的达到一万四千多斤；连他们的家族在内，每人约计有二千五百斤到三千三百斤稻谷的高额收入。集体农庄已经建立起巨大的公有财产：他们已经有二十八台锄草机、八台脱谷机、五台条播机和其他许多机具；他们已经建设了拥有四部电力制米机的制米厂、五部电动机、一部内燃机和一座铁工厂；他们还有四十六头耕牛和十口巴克夏种猪。
    这个集体农庄是怎样建立起来的呢？
    农庄主席金白山、生产小组长慎自成——集体农庄最早的两位发起人告诉我：“我们原来都是一无所有的农民，是一九四八年春天来到农场的。因为土地、房屋甚至自己的口粮都是国家供给或贷给的，我们就在农场的领导下，组织了共耕组。但第一年完全失败了……。”
    这情形我在农场场部里已经知道了：还在一九四七年，党和人民政府为了给摆脱了封建土地制度束缚的农民开辟一条通往无限幸福的道路，决定在佳木斯市东面的草原上建立一个示范农场——桦川水利农场，吸收附近农民参加农场耕作，由国家供给土地、房屋和机械，使农民在自己的亲身经验中，认识集体劳动、机械耕作和大规模农业生产的好处，从而自觉自愿地走向集体农业经济。当时农场干部缺乏经验，他们只是简单地用强迫命令的方式把农民们“四户一组”编成耕作组，按各组的劳力拨给了一块土地，就开始了第一年的生产。事实证明，并不因为在国家土地上耕作，农民们就能立即丢掉那传统的、强固的私有观念。有许多组，把农场供给小组公共使用的土地，也像当时正在进行土地改革的农村一样，每人一份“平分”了。那些没有把国家土地“平分”的耕作组，劳动起来是你推我拖，偷懒耍滑；到秋天分配收获时又你争我夺。虽然形式上“组织起来”了，实际上没有起互助的作用。农庄主席回忆当年的情形时说：“真是乱糟一团，活谁也不愿多作，收下来谁也想着多分。有些人当干部在跟前时，还勉强做两下；干部刚转身，就蹲在地头上抽烟扯闲天。”这一年生产成绩很坏，每个劳动力平均只耕种一公顷土地，虽然雨水调和，每公顷只收获了四千七百二十九斤稻谷。金白山和慎自成等四户编成的那个耕作组，像别的组一样，既没有制度，也不评工记分，平常胡里胡涂地干活，秋后马马虎虎地“人各一份”地“平分”了收获的粮食。
    失败常常是成功的先导，农场干部和农民都从一九四八年的实践中得到了有益的教训。农场党组织针对农民中普遍存在着的自私自利的小农思想，和绝对平均主义的农业社会主义思想，加强了党对农民的教育工作，加强了党在农民中的政治工作。农场行政方面组织农民劳动时，坚持了“自愿两利”的原则。一九四九年，川水利农场出现了三种劳动形式：少数落后的农民，认为“人多心不齐”，就“自愿”不参加互助组，向农场领了一块土地，“单干”去了。极大多数农民自找对象，两相情愿地组成了三、四户或五、六户的小型互助组。农民中的先进分子，组织了农业合作社性质的耕作小组。集体农庄的前身——第三农庄金白山、慎自成等五户组成的第五小组当时就是上述最后一种小组中最好的一个。
    金白山是第三农庄的生产委员。他来农场后，在党的教育下，思想进步很快，觉悟程度日高。在党和农场干部的宣传教育中，他开始了解到：只有实现集体化的农业，才能使农民真正走向幸福的生活。因此，一九四九年他组织第五小组时，就主张组织集体化耕作组，大家在农场拨给使用的土地上共同劳动，秋后按劳动分配收获物。农民们不同意他的意见，多数人主张把土地按各户人口“分开”，但不划地界不定地段，只是各户有个土地“数量”，秋后按地分粮，出工多和出工少的人用工资找补。当时金白山虽然说这样不合理，既然大家都要那样做，也只好暂时迁就一下。这一年，因为组里都是对心思的人，又有了些评工记分的制度，有事大家开会民主决定，组员们生产情绪很好。虽然遭到严重的虫灾，秋天每公顷仍平均收获四千八百斤；没有受灾的产量达到六千四百斤稻谷，超过其他各组。劳动效率也提高了，每个劳动力耕种的土地，由前一年的一公顷扩大到了一点七八公顷。他们这个组被选为桦川水利农场的模范组。
    第五组的组员们在自己的经验中，认识到这种不分地段不分地界的好处。慎自成说：“这样干起活来没偏心，没有你的种早啦、我的收晚啦的矛盾。遇到一两块地上有了灾害，也不致落在一家头上担不起。”他们也体会到这一年的办法的两大缺点：第
    一，人口少劳力壮的人家吃亏。就像金白山，他只两口人，只能分到两口人的土地“数量”。但他和他妻子都是好劳动，一年多出了四十多个工，只得到八百斤稻子的工资；如果不按土地而是按劳动日分粮，他可以分到一千四百斤。可见这种组织形式里面有剥削。特别是在农场里，土地是国家的，这是用国家的土地剥削别人的劳动，当然更不合理了。第二，只有五户组织在一起，人手太少；农忙时节，常常顾东顾不了西。比方稻子灌浆后，常有成群成群的野鸭，飞到稻田里糟害庄稼。小组人少，地连不成片，看鸭子需要好些人，别的活就耽误了。如果组大人多，这矛盾就解决了。因此，全组决定，第二年要改变成集体化耕作组，完全按劳动日分配收获物，并且把小组扩大。
    第三农庄的农民，亲眼看到金白山、慎自成领导的第五小组，庄稼收获的那么多，干部又领导得好，早已十分羡慕；听说第五小组吸收新组员，大家抢着参加，一九五○年就成立起了一个包括十四户的集体化耕作组。组扩大了，而且实行了“按劳取酬”的分配制度，组员们劳动热情很高，集体劳作的好处，一天比一天明显地表现出来。人手多了，可以按着各人特长分工，“能行风的行风，能行雨的行雨”，劳动效率高。遇有紧急农作时，有突击力量。像那年组里有七公顷稻田发现虫害，全组男女老少齐动手，一下子把虫子扑灭了，没有成灾。这一年的每个劳动力的耕种面积提高到一点八公顷，产量达到每公顷六千八百八十斤稻谷，是全农场产量最高的，比单干户每公顷多收二千八百斤，比互助组多收二千斤，比农业合作社或小型的集体化耕作组，每公顷也多收八百斤。这时，第五小组成了群众谈论的目标。农民们对它羡慕不已，纷纷要求参加。第五组一下扩大到三十六户。农场领导方面看到时机已经成熟，便投资一亿八千万元，为他们建立起“新庄”。于是，在一九五一年二月，桦川水利农场的第一个集体农庄便诞生了。
    只有经济利益，只有物质生活的提高，也还不能使集体农庄顺利地建立起来，建立了也不易发展，不能巩固。由个人经济变为集体经济，由一个小私有生产的农民变为集体农庄的庄员，是个巨大的变革；不仅要同外部的阻碍和困难作斗争，还要同农民自己的传统私有观念作斗争。慎自成告诉我这样
    一个故事：一九五一年初，第五耕作组要发展成为集体农庄时，许多农民，连那从来都不相信集体生产会给农民带来任何好处的姜东勋，都要求参加集体农庄时，五组一个老组员反而退了出去。这个农民没有认识到集体农庄制度是彻底解放农民，使一切农民永远摆脱穷困并进而获得一天比一天幸福的生活的唯一正确的道路，他把它当成暂时搭伙发财的场所了。这个农民叫洪日南。经过三年的集体劳动，他有了一头牛一辆车，还积蓄了三千多斤稻子。他说：“我现在可以自己过活了。”于是，他赶上他的大牛车到松花江北去“创造自己的幸福生活”去了。他在草原上开垦了两公顷半土地，像牛一样劳动到秋天；不幸得很，一场大水冲了，连种子也没收回来。人总是要吃饭的，没办法，卖掉了他的耕牛；到冬天连棉衣也穿不上，每天靠着在松花江上破冰捉鱼过日子。
    我问庄员李成林：“集体农庄给了农民些什么？”他说：“那怎么能说清呢？”他从他的祖父的穷困说到今天的丰裕生活，又从他的家庭说到其他庄员的家庭——是的，怎么能够说清呢？集体农庄将给予农民一切。这个集体农庄走过的道路已经向农民证明：由互助组、农业生产合作社到集体农庄，是农民走向幸福的文明的生活的唯一正确的方向。
    党——集体农庄的组织者
    共产党是集体农庄的组织者。这个集体农庄的每一个成就，都和党在农民中间进行的巨大政治工作和教育工作分不开，都和党员的忘我劳动和模范行动分不开。
    封建土地制度奴役下的农民，几千年一直梦想着自己有一小块土地、一头耕牛。党为了克服农民这种“单干”思想，从一九四八年桦川水利农场开始建立时起，便在农民中间进行了广泛的政治工作：建立冬学、开办训练班，利用各种集会，向农民群众宣传组织起来合作生产的好处，宣传大规模的、使用机械的农业生产的无比的优越性；宣传社会主义共产主义的无限美好的前途；使农民从社会发展律规中，认识他们应该选择的道路。
    党号召农村中的党员和围绕在党周围的先进农民，用自己的模范行为和对农民的具体帮助来团结和教育农民，以便逐渐地引导他们走向生产合作的道路。姜敬孝就是在党员金白山同志的具体帮助和兄弟般的关怀下参加集体农庄的。一九四八年姜敬孝来到农场时，虽然名义上参加了共耕组，实际上是单干的。那年，他劳动得很卖力气，但因为不会计划，有时作了计划，但因单枪匹马，力不从心，常常不能按计划实行，那年生产得很不好。夏天连条单裤也买不起，腰里围着条破麻袋，闪闪躲躲地混了一夏天。金白山同志帮助他把生活好好地计划了一下，把收获的稻子换成了小米、苞米等粗粮，准备下了第二年的吃粮。姜敬孝很感动，从此便参加了金白山同志的农业生产合作社——半集体化的耕作组。现在，姜敬孝已变成集体农庄中最好的庄员之一了。
    农民是最实际的人，只有他在实际上看到集体耕作能给他更多的利益时，他才相信它、拥护它、参加它。党员带头，首先给农民作出榜样来，是组织农民互助合作、引导农民走向集体化的一个很重要的方法。姜东勋是这样参加集体农庄的。一九四八年，他和别的农民一样被编到一个四户组成的共耕组里。组里的情况，使他认定了“三个和尚没水吃”是定而不移的“真理”。他那时说：“亲弟兄还有个争吵，素不相识的农民怎么能在一起共耕呢！”第二年，农场允许自愿组织耕作组时，他就“自愿”地回到老样子去了：向农场领了五公顷土地单干起来。他、他的妻子和十六岁的儿子，统统下地了。他看见那些虽有进步但还有些懒散的互助组，就微笑起来：“秋天看收成吧！”那年，他的辛勤劳动没有白费，每公顷收获了五千二百斤稻谷；除了比金白山的第五组较差外，比全庄任何互助组的产量都高。丰收使姜东勋的生活富裕起来，买进了一头大耕牛和一辆大车。他想：“我可以过活得更好些了。”可是，事情并不如他想的那样美妙。耕牛替他耕地、拉车、运东西；他也必须给耕牛准备草料和饮水。去喂耕牛便误了种地，去种地就不能照料耕牛。没办法，妻子留在家里，不能下地了。看看金白山他们的集体化耕作组，种田的种田，喂牛的喂牛，不慌不忙啥事也做在他前头。这一年姜东勋每公顷收获四千八百斤，比前一年减少了四百斤。金白山的集体化耕作组，每公顷收获六千八百八十斤，比前一年增加了二千多斤。这时候他才开始相信集体生产比他单干要好得多，开始相信农场干部一再宣传的“只有集体农业，才能给农民最大的利益”的话不是骗人的。所以，当金白山等发起组织集体农庄时，他第一个报名参加了。
    党员的忘我的工作和模范的劳动态度，是鼓舞庄员们前进的巨大动力。支部书记李在根，农庄主席金白山，是两个很好的党员干部。李在根同志善于依靠群众、团结群众，工作认真负责。去年春天集体农庄刚成立时，他带病领导群众兴建庄园，提前完成任务，被庄员们选举为出席一九五二年东北区工农兵劳动模范代表大会的代表。金白山同志考虑问题周到，领导全体庄员进行生产工作，做得有条不紊，使全庄九十九公顷的稻田得到了空前的丰收，每公顷平均收获八千四百三十斤。这样全农庄的、大面积的高额产量，不仅在桦川水利农场，在松江全省也是最高纪录。因此，庄员们选他参加了一九五一年度松江省的劳动模范大会，被评为全省的模范干部之一。
    在集体农庄各方面的生活中，尤其在生产劳动中，党员的模范行为和忘我无私的劳动范例是很多的。共产党员孙景道同志从一九四八年起，就连续被选为农场的、全省的劳动模范。一九五一年，集体农庄成立后，他又被庄员们选举为农庄的生产委员。他不仅领导全庄三个生产分队，把土地耕作得很好，保证了稻田的丰收；而且从没有因为工作耽误了参加田间劳动。他把开会、计划工作、整理庄员的劳动账目等等一切工作，都放到劳动过后的夜晚。他在农庄的任何公共劳动中，都比别人作得更多、更好。去年秋天，农庄买来十口巴克夏种猪。因为庄员们墨守过去旧的饲养方法，也因为田间劳动疲劳，很多人都不愿参加建筑猪舍的劳动。他以身作则，首先动手修建猪舍，带动庄员们也参加进来了。他这种忘我的辛勤劳动，在群众中树立起光荣的榜样。庄员们谈起他们的生产委员时，都衷心地拥护和赞佩：“孙景道担负着那么多工作，劳动日作的比谁都多。”一九五一年他共作了二百六十八个劳动日，是全庄最高的一个。
    集体农庄的建立、发展和巩固过程，也是克服小农思想和私有观念的过程。根据农庄支部书记李在根同志的经验，对农民进行这种教育，不仅在开始走向集体化的初期是必需的，就是在集体农庄成立以后，也是很重要的。他说：“这是长期的工作。”
    一九五一年九月，大部分庄员已经有了两年集体化农业经济的生活之后，还曾发生过这样的事情：集体农庄在国家贷款帮助下，购买了四十六头耕牛。庄员们讨论如何使用和饲养耕牛问题时，不少人主张把牛分配给各户，“想在自己门前拴上一头大耕牛”。当然，这是农民私有观念的表现，是同集体农庄耕牛公有的原则不合的。农庄党组织从各个方面说明这样作的害处，并通过党员不要耕牛的模范行动，影响和说服群众。后来的事实证明，耕牛属于农庄公有，比属于庄员个人是好处更多的：饲养时，全部的耕牛，有两三个人就可以照管过来了；耕种时的效率比私人的耕牛效率更高出许多。现在，庄员们都说：“耕牛还是属全庄公有更好些。要不，顾了喂牛顾不了下地，费工多啦！”
    和进行广泛的政治工作同时，党和人民政府，给予农民的密切关怀和经济援助，也是使集体农庄迅速发展和日益巩固的重要因素。在共产党领导下的人民政府，几年来曾给予移来农场的农民，特别是对于组织起来进行集体化生产的集体农庄的农民，以经常的关怀和巨大的援助。除了像对移来农场的
    一般农民一样供给土地房屋外，还给予大量贷款。仅仅在一九五一年内，国家就贷给集体农庄一亿八千万元，为全体庄员建造起新的住宅，购买了四十多头耕牛和许多农具。
    新型的农民
    党领导农民创造了幸福的新生活，也培育着新的农民。爱劳动、爱集体、爱护公共财产和热爱我们伟大的祖国，已开始成为集体农庄庄员们新的特质了。
    在旧社会里，在那人剥削人的封建时代的乡村里，农民间流传着这样一句话：“一个和尚担水吃，两个和尚抬水吃，三个和尚没水吃。”——集体农庄那么多人，他们怎样生活在一起的呢？
    这个集体农庄的庄员们，生活得很好，不仅没有发生“三个和尚没水吃”的事情，他们还把集体农庄变成了农民团结友爱的大家庭。农庄主席在谈到庄员们的劳动情形时说：“劳动是出于自觉，庄员们在生产中没有偷懒耍滑的。”这个集体农庄是在换工互助、农业合作社的基础上一步步发展起来的；是农民们从自己的亲身经验里，认识了集体劳动会带给他们更幸福的生活以后，自觉自愿地组织起来的。庄员们知道：他们在集体生产中劳动得越好，生活也就越丰裕；他们的农庄越壮大，他们的利益也越增多。因此，每个庄员都把集体农庄的事情，看作是自己的事情。
    在忙碌的打谷场上，一位脸上带着伤痕的老庄员，正在电力脱谷机旁紧张劳动。这就是从一九四八年搬到桦川水利农场来就一直单干，去年集体农庄成立时才参加集体农庄的姜东勋。不久前，他正在用脱谷机脱谷的时候，一不小心，挽在手上束稻禾的绳子，让脱谷机搅住了。脱谷机把他从这边摔到那边很远的地方去。他受了很重的伤：脸、眼摔破了，胳臂摔得不能动转。农庄管理委员会根据农庄的规定，让他休养五天，照样给他计算劳动日。可是，第三天姜东勋就又到打谷场上来了。庄员们都劝他回去休养，农庄主席也批评他不该忽视自己的身体。他感谢大家对他的关心，但却坚持自己的意见：“心烦比伤疼还难受。我在家闷不住，让我干点轻便活吧！”他就又站在那“轰轰”转动的脱谷机旁了。
    去年夏天，稻田除过最后一遍草后，庄员们利用这短暂的“农闲”时间，转入割草、打柴、建筑本庄小学校舍的紧张劳动中。经过庄员们精心侍弄的稻禾，在热烈的夏日阳光照耀下，是生长得很快的。不几天，稻花的清香便随风飘荡在草原上了。正在草原上割草打柴的姜敬孝，闻到那沁人心肺的清香，便想起那正在成熟的稻子：“又到野鸭糟害稻田的季节了。”第二天早晨，天蒙蒙亮，姜敬孝不告诉别人，便自己到稻田里去查看。果然，成群的野鸭，正在稻田里“咯咯”“呀呀”地喧闹着，成串地吞掳着稻穗。姜敬孝就和野鸭斗争起来：他吓跑东群，又去驱散西群，轰走北群，又去追赶南群。他赶完野鸭回家吃早饭的时候，累得浑身大汗，精疲力竭。但他一声不响，吃过早饭就像平常一样地同生产组的人到草原上去割柴。第二天早晨他又早早地到稻田里。野鸭更多了，姜敬孝更加狠狠地驱逐它们。随着稻子的成熟，野鸭一天比一天更猖狂了，一个人再难应付那此飞彼落的野鸭群。第三天早晨，姜敬孝从稻田里回来后，不得不把这严重的鸭害情况，报告给农庄主席，农庄主席立时接受他的建议，加强了稻田的防害工作。
    像爱护自己一样地无微不至地珍爱公共财产和全农庄的利益，已成为庄员们新的道德标准。晚上收工后，打谷场上总有不少人自动留在后边，清扫场院，把每一件农具都收拾得妥妥贴贴。那位会机电工程的、一只手的庄员郑求兴，到佳木斯市购买制米机上的零件，往返八十里，回来后不休息，连夜把电力制米机安装起来。这样的事体是说不完的。“每人为大家，大家为每人”，从哪一个庄员身上都可以找到爱劳动、爱集体、爱护公共财产的新品质。
    在党和人民政府的教育和关怀下，获得了丰裕生活，踏上了进往人类最幸福的道路的集体农庄的农民，是热爱我们伟大的祖国的。他们说：“只有在这样的国家，我们农民才能得到幸福。”一九五一年六月，抗美援朝总会号召全国人民增加生产，捐献飞机、大炮，支援中国人民志愿军时，集体农庄的庄员们决定：每公顷土地增产七十斤稻子、五百斤稻草，捐献给志愿军。秋收后，他们共捐献了七千斤稻子、五万斤稻草。女庄员们还另从她们的副业收入中，捐献了一口三百斤的大肥猪和一百四十三个草袋子。庄员们知道，他们的幸福生活，是靠英勇的中国人民志愿军和人民解放军来保卫的，平常对于优待军人家属工作就作得很好。春节时，庄员们用五十四斤猪肉去慰劳第三农庄——他们的“故乡”的军属；用三十六斤猪肉，慰劳了本庄的九户军属。他们还向桦川水利农场中所有的军属写了祝贺信。
    我在集体农庄采访时，住在庄员慎自成家里。每逢吃饭他就说起过去的穷困生活。有一次我插了话，和他谈起现在的生活来，我们谈的很多，很热闹。最后，他对着自己碗里盛着热腾腾的大米饭，下结论似地说：“这全是共产党、毛主席给的啊！”
    一九四九年，金白山同志组织集体化耕作组时，他还不赞成，硬要按土地分粮；现在，他说：“如今你看看，毛主席和人民政府只要一号召，咱庄员们没有一个不是马上照办的。”
    新型的农民有新的生活方式。农庄有很好的民主管理制度，有自觉的纪律。这些新型的农民，已开始掌握批评和自我批评的武器作为自己进步的动力。
    二月下旬，集体农庄主席连续召开了几个夜晚的庄员大会，向庄员们报告附近农村的农民要求参加集体农庄的情形，并请庄员大会讨论批准。吸收新庄员的事情是和集体农庄的发展、巩固有很大关系的，必须由庄员大会讨论通过才行，任何个人都不能自作主张。庄员大会是集体农庄最高的权力机关，它要选举集体农庄的主席和管理委员会的委员，要讨论和批准农庄的生产计划；拟定庄员的工作标准和工作报酬；审查农庄财政开支和批准预算；听取管理委员会和主席的工作报告同总结等等。总之，集体农庄里一切重要的事情都要经庄员大会讨论批准，才能实行。这个集体农庄的章程上规定：每一个农业季节终了和开头，都要举行庄员大会，听取上一季节的工作总结和下季的工作计划。因为集体农庄成立不久，各方面工作都是初创，需要庄员们讨论决定的问题特别多，一九五一年共召开过三十多次庄员大会，平均十天就举行了一次庄员大会。
    管理委员会是执行庄员大会决议的日常工作机关，庄员大会的主席也就是管理委员会的主席。管理委员会有主席、副主席、生产委员、文化教育委员、财粮会计委员等，分工负责管理日常工作。主席、副主席和财粮委员是脱离生产不参加田间劳动的；他们的报酬，按照中等劳动力计算劳动日，秋后和庄员们一样，按照劳动日的“值”得到应得的报酬。在一个三十六户的集体农庄里，三个脱离生产的工作人员是否太多了？详细访问以后，知道这是不算太多的。集体农庄里是把过去每个农户需要自己筹办、安排的事情，像准备农具、种子、喂养耕牛、缴纳公粮等等，都由管理委员会集中管理起来。难怪庄员们谈起他们那自由自在的新生活时，总是炫耀地说：“从田里回来，愿意休息就休息，愿意看书就看书，随你的意，什么杂事也不来麻烦你。”如果计算一下三十六户个体农民在这方面化费的时间，是远比三个人多得多的。当然，随着集体农庄的发展和工作进步，脱离生产的专业干部是还可以减少的。一九五二年这个集体农庄庄员由原来的三十六户扩大到六十户后，专业干部还是三个人，并不增加。
    因为农庄里一切重要事情，都是经过庄员们讨论决定的，因为农庄的干部都是庄员们直接选举的，所以庄员们都把农庄的事情看成自己的事情，对于整个农庄的工作，都自动自愿地作。就是有个别庄员违犯决议时，不仅管理委员会的干部会劝告他，庄员们也会批评他。像去年春天，庄员们本来已经决定，下地时由生产委员敲钟为号；但女庄员崔明淑总是迟到，有时生产委员去她家叫她才来。庄员们对她提出批评后，她就改正了。现在，工作上的制度和纪律，已不再被庄员们觉得是拘束，而成为他们的生活和工作的习惯了。
