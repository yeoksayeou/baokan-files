Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 2nd:

    In recent days, the US side representatives have adopted an arrogant and unreasonable attitude in the Korean armistice negotiations, attempting to use the destruction of the armistice negotiations as a threat to force our side to accept the other side's absurd proposals on various issues. At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item and at the staff meeting on the third agenda item on March 2nd, the other side more deliberately and publicly stated: "Seriously doubt whether it is worthwhile to continue efforts to reach an agreement." Our side representatives severely criticized the other side's absurd and arrogant attitude at both group meetings, pointing out that since the beginning of the armistice negotiations, the other side has repeatedly attempted to obstruct the armistice negotiations by bombing the neutral zone and undermining the neutral zone agreement, and the other side has also repeatedly attempted to threaten with so-called "military pressure." But the other side should have learned from past experiences that any arrogant threats from the other side will only expose the other side's attempts to delay and undermine the armistice negotiations in front of the people of the world, and will not have any effect on the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. If the other side is still sincere and desires progress in the armistice conference, it must withdraw such an arrogant and unreasonable attitude; if the other side deliberately delays and undermines the armistice negotiations, the other side must bear all responsibility.
    At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, our side strongly condemned the other side's unjustified opposition to our side's nominations of neutral nations. The other side itself had to admit that every neutral country proposed by our side fully complied with the definition of a neutral country agreed upon by both sides. The other side itself knows that it cannot offer any reasons, and there is no reason to oppose any of the neutral countries nominated by our side, but the other side is still attempting to use the procedure of mutual agreement as an excuse to unjustifiably oppose our side's nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral country. Our side once again pointed out that the definition of a neutral country is the only criterion for accepting or rejecting nominations of neutral countries, and the procedure of mutual agreement is a form of expressing mutual respect between the negotiating parties, and must not be used to reject a nomination by one party that fully complies with the definition of a neutral country. In order to resolve the issue of neutral country nominations, our side has proposed two completely reasonable plans, either both sides simultaneously and at once agree to all the nominations proposed by the other side, or both sides nominate neutral countries separately without any agreement procedure, one of the two must be chosen.
    At the subcommittee meeting on the fourth agenda item, our side representatives strongly condemned the other side for creating various excuses and adopting various tactics to delay the meeting, and pointed out that in order to delay the meeting, the other side did not hesitate to push the meeting's discussion back to the situation on December 18th of last year. Our side representative solemnly told the other side: "In the three days of meetings, you have blatantly expressed your determination to delay any progress in the meeting and fundamentally do not want to solve the problem." "If you want to repeat past discussions and recite the records of the past seventy-odd days, you certainly have your freedom. But we will resolutely oppose and resolutely fight against your tricks of creating extraneous issues and using excuses to delay. If you are really concerned about the armistice, concerned about the welfare of the prisoners of war, and willing to negotiate to solve the problem, you must withdraw your unreasonable attitude of using excuses to delay the meeting and your absurd and arrogant principles."

    朝鲜谈判第三、四两项议程会议上
    我方严正指斥美方借端拖延停战谈判
    【新华社开城二日电】连日以来，美方代表在朝鲜停战谈判中采取了蛮横无理的狂妄态度，企图以破坏停战谈判作为威胁强迫我方接受对方在各项问题上的荒谬方案。三月二日第四项议程的小组委员会上和第三项议程的参谋会议上，对方更有计划地公开声称：“严重怀疑是否值得继续达成协议的努力。”我方代表在两组会议上痛斥对方的荒谬狂妄态度，指出对方自停战谈判开始以来，曾一再企图以轰炸中立区、破坏中立区协议来阻挠停战谈判，对方亦曾一再企图以所谓“军事压力”进行威胁。但对方早应从过去的经验教训中得出结论，任何对方狂妄的威胁将只是在全世界人民面前暴露对方拖延和破坏停战谈判的企图，而不能对朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军产生任何作用。如果对方还有诚意愿望停战会议的进展，就必须撤回这样狂妄无理的态度；如果对方蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判，对方必须担负全部责任。
    第三项议程的参谋会议上，我方痛斥对方对于我方中立国提名的毫无理由的反对。对方自己也不得不承认我方所提出的每一个中立国家都是完全符合于双方协议的中立国的定义的。对方自己也知道提不出任何理由，也没有任何理由反对我方提名中的任何一个中立国家，但对方却仍然企图以双方同意的手续为藉口，毫无理由地反对我方提名苏联为中立国。我方再次指出中立国定义是接受或拒绝中立国提名的唯一标准，双方同意的手续是表示谈判双方互相尊重的形式，决不容许被利用来拒绝一方完全合乎中立国定义的提名。为了解决中立国提名问题，我方已提出两种完全合理的方案，要就是双方同时并一次同意对方所提出的全部提名，要就是双方各自提名中立国家不必进行任何同意手续，二者必居其一。
    第四项议程小组委员会上，我方代表痛斥对方制造种种藉口，采取各种手法来拖延会议，并指出对方为了拖延会议，竟不惜把会议的讨论推回到去年十二月十八日的状况。我方代表郑重告诉对方说：“你们在三天会议中，露骨地表示你们决心要拖延会议的任何进展，根本不想解决问题”。“如果你们要重复过去的讨论，背诵已往七十余日的记录，当然有你们的自由。但我们将坚决反对，坚决与你们这种节外生枝、借端拖延的诡计进行斗争。如果你们真的关心停战，关心战俘的福利，愿意谈判解决问题，你们必须收回你们那种横蛮无理的借端拖延会议的态度，和荒谬狂妄的原则”。
