Soviet Life and People's Democratic Countries

    Soviet Children's Literature Awarded Stalin Prizes
    The Soviet Union published nearly 60 million copies of children's books in the languages of the various Soviet peoples last year. Many children's literature writers were awarded Stalin Prizes for 1951. Belyayev's trilogy "The Old Fortress," Nosov's story "Vitya Maleev at School and at Home," and Osyeyeva's "Trubachev's Detachment" all received Stalin Prizes.
    These books are very popular with young readers. They faithfully depict the lives of Soviet children and teenagers, and the democratic Soviet education they receive. The protagonists in these books—contemporaries of the readers—are role models worthy of emulation. These books inspire magnificent thoughts, strong and noble emotions, and the desire to be useful to society and to serve the people wholeheartedly.
    The story of "The Old Fortress" takes place in Ukraine. This trilogy tells the story of the generation of Soviet people who spent their childhood in the first few years after the October Revolution. They grew and matured along with the country; they strengthened the motherland and fought against its enemies. Today, these men and women are participating in the great communist construction projects, and they are transforming nature.
    The stories by the extremely popular children's literature writers Nosov and Osyeyeva introduce the atmosphere of school life, recreate the imagination of Soviet children, and show their spiritual purity. These two books enlighten children on how to overcome difficulties not only in learning but also in life.
    The development of multinational children's literature is a major achievement of Soviet culture, and the best Soviet writers have contributed to this literature. The children's books published in the Soviet Union reflect the wide range of life phenomena in socialist society, and they inform young readers about the achievements in science and mechanics, and about the lives of foreign people. The best readings with noble ideological content teach millions of Soviet children how to live, how to master knowledge, and how to strive for the bright future of mankind.
    
    Poland Collects Folk Music
    The Polish government attaches great importance to Poland's national cultural heritage and folk art.
    With the assistance of the radio station, the Polish National Art Institute has been collecting Polish folk music, songs, and recording records since July 1950. With the strong assistance of the state, the personnel engaged in this work organized six touring groups to collect folk songs and music in Silesia, Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk (Danzig), Lublin and other places. Now more than 20,000 songs have been recorded.
    In order to enable young people interested in folk music to participate in this work, the National Art Institute and the music departments of the universities of Warsaw, Poznan and Krakow jointly held a special class in the summer of 1951 to enable music students to learn and familiarize themselves with knowledge in this area.
    The rich materials collected by the various groups are of great value to composers, professional or amateur bands and choirs, and the entire Polish literary and artistic undertaking.
    The Polish National Art Institute will organize the collected materials and publish them in books for promotion throughout the country.

    荣获斯大林奖金的苏联儿童文学作品
    苏联去年用苏联各族人民的语文出版了将近六千万册儿童读物。许多儿童文学作家荣获了一九五一年斯大林奖金。柏里雅耶夫的三部曲“古堡”、诺索夫的故事“马列耶夫在学校和在家里”以及奥塞耶娃的“特鲁巴契夫和他的同志们”都荣获了斯大林奖金。
    这几本书很受少年读者的欢迎。它们忠实地描写了苏联儿童和少年的生活、他们所受的民主的苏维埃的教养。这些书中的主人公——读者的同代人——都是值得仿效的模范。这些书激发了人们辉煌的思想、强烈而高尚的情感、想对社会有益并且忠心为人民服务的愿望。
    “古堡”的故事发生在乌克兰。这部三部曲叙述了在十月革命以后最初几年度过了童年的那一代苏联人的故事。他们跟着国家一道生长成熟起来；他们加强了祖国的力量并对它的敌人斗争。今天，这些男男女女参加了伟大的共产主义建设工程，他们在改造大自然。
    极受欢迎的儿童文学作家诺索夫和奥塞耶娃的故事介绍了学校生活的气氛，它们重现了苏联儿童的想像并且显示了他们精神上的纯洁。这两本书开导儿童们不仅在学习方面、而且在生活方面如何克服困难。
    多民族的儿童文学的发展乃是苏维埃文化的一大成就，苏联最优秀的作家对这种文学都有贡献。苏联出版的儿童读物反映出社会主义社会极大范围的生活现象，它们使少年读者知道了科学和机械方面的成就，知道了外国人民的生活。具有高尚思想内容的最优秀的读物教导了千百万苏联儿童如何生活，如何精通知识，如何为人类光辉的未来而努力。
    波兰搜集民间音乐
    波兰政府十分重视波兰的民族文化遗产与民间艺术。
    波兰国家艺术学院在广播电台的协助下，自一九五○年七月起开始搜集波兰民间音乐、歌曲与灌制唱片的运动。由于国家的大力协助，从事这一工作的人员组织了六个巡回小组，分别到西里西亚、克拉科、波斯南、革旦斯克（但泽）、卢布林等地搜集民间歌曲和音乐，现在已有二万多个歌曲灌制成唱片。
    为了使对民间音乐感到兴趣的青年参加这项工作，国家艺术学院和华沙、波斯南及克拉科各大学的音乐系于一九五一年夏季共同合作举办了一个特别班，使音乐系的学生们得以学习与熟悉这方面的知识。
    各小组所搜集来的丰富材料，对于作曲家、职业的或业余的乐队合唱团与波兰整个文艺事业来说，都具有十分重要的价值。
    波兰国家艺术学院将把所搜集来的材料整理出来，刊印成册，以便推广全国。
