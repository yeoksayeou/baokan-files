Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 7th: People's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held meetings on the 6th, angrily protesting the bloody atrocities of British imperialism in slaughtering and arresting Chinese people in Hong Kong on March 1st. Participants included representatives from 25 people's organizations, such as the Guangdong Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the Guangzhou City Branch, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou City Federation of Trade Unions, as well as representatives of disaster victims from Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, who were unreasonably deported by the British Hong Kong government, and film artists. At the meeting, representatives of various people's organizations unanimously stated that they absolutely could not tolerate the atrocities of British imperialism in slaughtering our patriotic compatriots, and solemnly warned the British Hong Kong government that if the British Hong Kong government did not immediately stop the persecution of Chinese residents, it would be met with utter defeat in the face of the powerful Chinese people. Lin Qiangyun, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, called on the working class and people from all walks of life in Guangdong to unite and support the anti-persecution struggle of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong until they achieve final victory!

The conference finally adopted a joint statement from people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City to protest the British Hong Kong government's refusal to allow a delegation to visit Kowloon to express condolences to the disaster-stricken compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, and its planned and organized bloody atrocities of slaughtering our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The statement said: "On February 6th, we jointly organized a delegation to visit 16,000 of our compatriots in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, who suffered a catastrophe in the bizarre fire that occurred on November 21st last year and who have been continuously persecuted by the British Hong Kong government, preparing to thoroughly investigate the truth about the fire and the persecution of our compatriots and make it public. This action to uphold justice and fairness is something the British Hong Kong government has no reason to refuse. However, the British Hong Kong government officially announced on the morning of March 1st that it would refuse our delegation to go to Kowloon. This unreasonable behavior is evidence that the British Hong Kong government insists on being hostile to the Chinese people and has a guilty conscience. What is particularly infuriating is that while unreasonably refusing our delegation to go to Kowloon, they dispatched a large number of police in a planned and organized manner to capture and kill compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong who were waiting to welcome our delegation from 3:45 pm to 5:45 pm on March 1st, and after staging bloody atrocities, they conspired to arrest our patriotic compatriots on a large scale.

We will never tolerate the British Hong Kong government's unreasonable behavior, bloody atrocities, and malicious conspiracies! We want to lodge a serious protest with the British Hong Kong government and solemnly declare: The British Hong Kong government must bear full responsibility for this bloody atrocity! The British Hong Kong government must immediately release the Hong Kong residents of our country who have been unreasonably detained, be responsible for the medical treatment of the injured, compensate for all the economic losses of those arrested and injured, and punish all the murderers! The British Hong Kong government must immediately abandon its conspiracy to persecute Hong Kong residents of our country, stop all provocative actions, and change its course; otherwise, it will bear full responsibility for all serious consequences.

Finally, we express our admiration for the spirit of Hong Kong compatriots in loving the motherland and fighting against persecution, and express our sincere concern for the compatriots who have suffered in this British imperialist killing atrocity. Although the delegation is unable to personally go to Kowloon to express condolences due to the British Hong Kong government's unreasonable refusal, we are determined to continue to support your just struggle with all our strength until final victory!"

The Guangzhou Nanfang Daily published an editorial on the 7th entitled "Another Blood Debt of British Imperialism in Slaughtering Patriotic Compatriots in Hong Kong," severely condemning the British Hong Kong government's bloody atrocities of arresting and slaughtering our patriotic compatriots on March 1st, and issuing a serious protest and warning.

    广东省、广州市各人民团体集会
    抗议英帝国主义捕杀我国同胞
    严正声明：香港英国政府必须释放被无理拘捕的我国居民，负责医疗受伤者，赔偿损失，惩处一切杀人凶犯
    【新华社广州七日电】广东省、广州市各人民团体在六日举行集会，愤怒抗议英帝国主义在三月一日屠杀和逮捕香港中国人民的血腥暴行。参加集会的有中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会广东省分会、广州市分会、广东省总工会筹备会、广州市总工会筹备会等二十五个人民团体的代表和最近被香港英国政府无理驱逐出境的九龙城东头村灾民代表及电影艺术工作者。会上，各人民团体代表一致表示绝对不能容忍英帝国主义屠杀我爱国同胞的暴行，并严正警告香港英国政府，如果香港英国政府不立即停止迫害中国居民的暴行，必将在强大的中国人民面前碰得头破血流。广东省总工会筹备会主任林锵云在会上号召全广东的工人阶级和各界人民，一致起来支援香港我爱国同胞的反迫害斗争，直到他们取得最后胜利！
    大会最后通过了广东省、广州市各人民团体为抗议香港英国政府拒绝慰问九龙城东头村受灾同胞代表团前往九龙和有计划、有布置地屠杀我香港爱国同胞的血腥暴行的联合声明。声明说：“我们在二月六日联合组织代表团，要前往九龙东头村慰问在去年十一月二十一日发生的离奇大火遭受浩劫并不断被香港英国政府迫害的一万六千位我国同胞，准备把当时起火真相和同胞被迫害情形，作详细调查后公诸于世。这一维护公理正义的行动，香港英国政府是没有任何理由可以拒绝的。但香港英国政府竟于三月一日上午十时正式宣布拒绝我代表团前往九龙。这种无理行为，是香港英国政府坚持与中国人民为敌和作贼心虚的证据。尤其令人愤恨的是：他们一面无理拒绝我代表团前往九龙，一面于三月一日下午三时四十五分至五时四十五分的时间内，出动大批警察有计划、有布置地捕杀候迎我代表团的香港各界同胞，复在演出血腥暴行之后，阴谋大规模逮捕我爱国同胞。
    香港英国政府的无理行为、血腥暴行和恶毒阴谋，我们决不能容忍！我们要向香港英国政府提出严重的抗议，并严正声明：香港英国政府对这次血腥暴行要负完全责任！香港英国政府必须立即释放被无理拘捕的香港我国居民，负责医疗受伤者，赔偿被捕者和受伤者的全部经济损失，惩处一切杀人凶犯！香港英国政府必须立即放弃其迫害香港我国居民的阴谋计划，停止一切挑衅行动，改弦易辙；否则它要对一切严重后果负完全的责任。
    最后，我们对香港同胞热爱祖国和反迫害斗争精神表示敬佩，对在这次英帝国主义捕杀暴行中受害的同胞表示亲切关怀。现在代表团虽因香港英国政府横蛮拒绝而无法亲到九龙进行慰问，但我们决定继续以全力支持你们的正义斗争直到最后胜利！”
    广州南方日报七日以“英帝国主义屠杀香港爱国同胞的又一笔血债”为题发表社论，对香港英国政府三月一日逮捕和屠杀我爱国同胞的血腥暴行严予斥责，并提出严重抗议和警告。
