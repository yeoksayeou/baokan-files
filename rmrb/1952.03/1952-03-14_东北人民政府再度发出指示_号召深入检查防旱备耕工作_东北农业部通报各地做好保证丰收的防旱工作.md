The Northeast People's Government Agricultural Department recently issued a circular on inspection of drought prevention and spring ploughing, pointing out that the spring ploughing and drought prevention work in many places has not been done well enough, and the leading organs in many places have not seriously led and inspected production and drought prevention work. The circular requires all regions to pay attention to this serious problem and solve it in a timely manner, so as not to affect the increased production movement. Concurrently with the circular, on the 5th of this month, the Northeast People's Government reissued instructions, ordering all regions to conduct in-depth inspections of drought prevention and spring ploughing work.

The Northeast People's Government Agricultural Department's circular stated: In the key village surveys in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Liaodong provinces, it was found that fertilizer application in farmland was generally insufficient. In Zhengyi Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, the fertilizer application area can only reach about 40% of the village's cultivated land area. In Daizhu Village, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, the fertilizer application area only reached 30%. In Minhe Village, Acheng County, Songjiang Province, the fertilizer application area only reached 44.3%. Xingtai Village, Dongfeng County, Liaodong Province, was relatively better, but even there only 80% of the cultivated land was fertilized. Therefore, all regions must seize the time, try all possible means to increase fertilizer application, and increase the fertilizer application area by 10% on the basis of 1951.

In terms of seed selection: In the cotton-producing areas, only Zhangjiatun, Gaiping County, Liaodong Province, carried out seed selection by grain, while Yi County, Liaoxi Province, did not. In the grain-producing areas, generally only soybean seeds were selected, and other grain seeds were not. Therefore, in addition to actively mobilizing farmers who have not selected seeds to immediately carry out seed selection, all regions should also organize all forces to exchange improved varieties. The people's government should help solve the seed problems of farmers in disaster areas as soon as possible.

Agricultural tools in many areas have not yet been inspected and repaired. The relationship between households with horses and those without must be properly adjusted to ensure that households without horses do not suffer losses or get bullied. In cotton-producing areas with insufficient livestock power, plowing should be started appropriately earlier.

Many leading cadres in various regions still have a paralyzing mentality towards drought prevention and drought resistance work. Individual counties have experienced drought for two consecutive years, but leading cadres still do not pay attention to leading farmers in drought prevention. Therefore, all regions need to earnestly summarize and promote past drought prevention and drought resistance experiences, and combine them with improved farming techniques to effectively carry out drought prevention and drought resistance work to ensure a bumper harvest.

### 东北人民政府再度发出指示  号召深入检查防旱备耕工作  东北农业部通报各地做好保证丰收的防旱工作

    东北人民政府再度发出指示
    号召深入检查防旱备耕工作
    东北农业部通报各地做好保证丰收的防旱工作
    东北人民政府农业部最近发出防旱备耕检查通报，指出好些地方备耕工作和防旱工作都作得不够好，好些地方的领导机关没有认真领导和检查生产防旱工作。通报要求各地注意这个严重的问题，及时加以解决，以免影响增产运动。与通报同时，本月五日，东北人民政府再度发出指示，责成各地深入地检查防旱备耕工作。
    东北人民政府农业部的通报说：吉林、黑龙江、松江、辽东四省在重点村调查中发现各地农田施肥普遍不足。吉林省舒兰县正义村的施肥面积只能达到全村耕地面积的百分之四十左右。黑龙江省肇东县戴朱屯施肥面积只达百分之三十。松江省阿城县民合村施肥面积只达百分之四十四点三。辽东省东丰县兴太村比较好，也只有百分之八十的耕地下了肥。为此，各地必须抓紧时间，想尽各种办法增加施肥，在一九五一年的基础上提高百分之十的施肥面积。
    选种方面：棉产区除辽东省盖平县张家屯作到粒选外，辽西省义县就未做到。粮产区一般的只选了一下豆种，其他粮食种籽都未选。因此，各地除一方面积极发动未选种的农民立即进行选种外，并组织一切力量串换良种。灾区农民的种籽问题，人民政府更应及早帮助解决。
    许多地区的农具至今也还没有检查和修补。有马户和无马户的关系须要很好调整，务使无马户不吃亏、不受气。棉产区畜力不足，应适当地提早开犁。
    不少地区的领导干部对防旱、抗旱工作仍存有麻痹思想。个别的县份连旱过两年，但领导干部还不注意领导农民防旱。为此各地需切实地总结和推广过去防旱、抗旱经验，结合改进耕作技术，有效地做好保证丰收的防旱、抗旱工作。（新华社）
