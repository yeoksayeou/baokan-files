Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 21st—The French imperialists, who have suffered shameful defeats in the war of aggression against Vietnam, are intensifying their persecution of overseas Chinese workers living in the French-occupied areas of Vietnam.

According to overseas Chinese workers like Long Haiwen, who were forced to return from Mong Cai in North Vietnam, from December 13th of last year to January 19th of this year, the special agents and military police of the French imperialists, under the pretext of searching for "identification papers," searched eleven bowl factories and one tile and brick factory in Mong Cai, and unreasonably arrested a total of twenty-six overseas Chinese workers and their family members, including Qiu Mingliang, Long Haide, and Pan Fulin. Among them, six people, including Lü Liu and Chen Gengsi, have been released, but the whereabouts of Zhong Xin and Huang Deqiang's wife are unknown, while the other eighteen people, including Qiu Mingliang, were taken to Xian'an and Haiphong on February 2nd and 5th, and their fate remains unknown. The arrested overseas Chinese workers have all been subjected to torture and ill-treatment, including beatings and electric shocks. In addition, the French imperialists also forced sixty-five overseas Chinese workers, including Chen Jinming, to leave Vietnam and return to China.

This brutal persecution of overseas Chinese by the French imperialists has aroused great anger among the broad masses of overseas Chinese. The workers who have been forced to return to places like Dongxing in Guangxi Province have received warm condolences from the local People's Government and their working-class brothers, and the People's Government has helped them return to their hometowns to engage in production.

    法帝国主义加紧迫害华侨　引起越南广大华侨的愤怒
    【新华社南宁二十一日电】在侵略越南的战争中遭到可耻失败的法帝国主义者，正在加紧迫害住在越南法占区的华侨工人。
    据从北越芒街被迫归国的华侨工人龙海文等说：从去年十二月十三日到今年一月十九日，法帝国主义者的特务和军警，以搜查“身税证”为藉口，搜查了芒街的十一家碗厂和一家瓦磁厂，无理逮捕了邱明亮、龙海德、潘富林等华侨工人和工人的眷属共二十六人。其中除吕六、陈廾四等六人已被释放外，钟信和黄德强之妻两人不知下落，其他邱明亮等十八人则在二月二日和五日先后被押往先安和海防，至今生死不明。被捕的华侨工人都曾受过毒打、电刑等酷刑和虐待。此外，法帝国主义者并迫令华侨工人陈锦明等六十五人离越返国。
    法帝国主义者这种残酷迫害华侨的暴行，已引起广大华侨的极大愤怒。被迫回到广西省东兴等地的工人，受到当地人民政府和工人阶级兄弟的亲切慰问，人民政府并已帮助他们回乡生产。
