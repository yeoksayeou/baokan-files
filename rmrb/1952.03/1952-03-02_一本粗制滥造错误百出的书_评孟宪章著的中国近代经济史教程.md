    A Crude and Error-Ridden Book
    -- A Review of Meng Xianzhang's "A Course in Modern Chinese Economic History"
    Wang Jingyu
    Published by Zhonghua Book Company, September 1951
    Meng Xianzhang's "A Course in Modern Chinese Economic History" is the first specialized book on modern Chinese economic history published after the national liberation. Its content summary declares the goal of "using dialectical materialism to systematically narrate the semi-feudal and semi-colonial economy of the past hundred years." In the author's preface, he lists many past studies and works on Chinese social and economic history, emphasizing the importance of "organizing a correct and detailed Chinese modern economic history based on the painstaking research achievements of Chinese economic scholars." However, in reality, this is a book with serious political errors, written with an extremely unserious attitude.
    First, the author did not seriously study Chairman Mao's analysis of the nature of modern Chinese society, and therefore did not possess the primary conditions for studying modern Chinese economic history. Although the author quoted some of Chairman Mao's words, in many places, he violated the essence of these words. Many errors and ambiguous assertions arise from this. For example, when explaining the economic status of the petty bourgeoisie, the author said: "Various types of petty bourgeoisie... like the workers and peasants, suffer from triple oppression" (page 139). When explaining that the petty bourgeoisie "is one of the driving forces of the revolution and a reliable ally of the proletariat," he said: "The intellectual group and the youth student group... from the student movement before the Xinhai Revolution, all mass movements have had their participation and guidance." (page 139). He juxtaposes the May Fourth Movement with the Hundred Days' Reform and the Xinhai Revolution, believing that they all belong to the "past old democratic revolution stage" (page 29). He said that the Chinese bourgeoisie once "demonstrated their dominant force" in the May Fourth Movement (page 29), but could not "transform it into a bourgeois democratic revolution to complete the unfinished tasks of the Xinhai Revolution" (page 117), so "the May Fourth Movement must be recognized as a stillbirth in the process of national liberation" (page 118).
    "The subsequent May 30th Movement, the Northern Expedition, the Agrarian Revolution... until the People's Liberation War, this bourgeois revolutionary movement... was no longer led solely by the fragile and compromising bourgeoisie." (page 385). These ambiguous explanations substantially violate Chairman Mao's scientific judgment on history. In addition, the author attributes the need for two steps in the Chinese revolution to "general economically backward countries, which not only suffer from unequal fair management, but also suffer more from scarcity" (page 384). He made an extremely vulgar explanation of why the New Democratic economy is necessary. For example, he said that the four major families "accumulated a large amount of capital for China's New Democratic national economy" (page 318), that the Russo-Japanese War "inspired the East Asian nations" (page 78); that the Opium War "is not considered a particularly great humiliation", and that China's descent from a feudal society to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society is called "revolution" (all above from page 26). These statements are problematic. As for his definition of the four democratic classes as the people, and "the general reactionary elements, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists who have been deprived of political rights but have not lost their nationality" as the nationals (page 390), it fully demonstrates the author's ignorance.
    Secondly, the summary states that this book "on the other hand, narrates how the revolutionary democratic regime under the leadership of the CCP correctly leads the people... to fight for the destruction of the old production relations and the establishment of a New Democratic economic system. There is a detailed narrative of the sharp contrast between the liberated areas and the KMT-controlled areas during the Anti-Japanese War and after the victory." However, the author is completely unqualified to undertake this task. He not only cannot grasp the development process of the New Democratic economy, but also does not understand the basic economic policies of the people's democratic regime in various periods. This is concentrated in his understanding of land policy. Although he spent a considerable amount of space explaining this issue, his understanding is very vague and disorganized. It is only necessary to give one example: when elaborating on Chairman Mao's speech at the Cadre Conference in Jin Sui, he actually dropped the sentence "except for those counter-revolutionary elements and despotic elements who are hated by the broad masses of the people and whose crimes have been verified, and who can and should be punished", leaving only the sentence "firmly advocating a lenient policy towards all people" (page 377). In addition, when elaborating on the financial policy of the people's democratic regime during the Anti-Japanese War, he said: "The characteristic of the New Democratic finance is that it uses 90% of its strength to serve the people and solve their production problems, and then only uses 10% of its strength to ask the people for things." (page 267). This statement is very erroneous. The "using 90% of its strength to serve the people... and then using 10% of its strength to ask the people for things" mentioned here is copied from Chairman Mao's "Economic Problems and Financial Problems" written in 1942 (and it is not the original sentence). However, Chairman Mao was talking about it as a problem of mass viewpoint at the time; Meng Xianzhang regarded it as a "characteristic of the New Democratic finance", which is an ignorant distortion.
    We say that the author adopted an unserious attitude towards the writing of "A Course in Modern Chinese Economic History", which is also reflected in his bold plagiarism style. This book is actually a patchwork of copies from various sources. (It is surprising that from the Opium War to the First Domestic Revolutionary War, most of it can be said to be excerpts from Hua Gang's "History of the Chinese National Liberation Movement" and Hu Hua's "History of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution.") Therefore, in terms of viewpoints and the handling of historical facts, there are many places where errors are inherited, and there are contradictions before and after. For example, Dasheng Textile Factory, Huasheng Textile Factory, Rihui Woolen Factory, Boshan Glass Company, Yaoxu Glass Company, Liling Porcelain Company, Jingdezhen Porcelain Company, Zhongxing Coal Mine Company, etc., were first called "national enterprises" (pages 80-81), and later classified as "bureaucratic capital" (page 94). Why are there contradictions before and after? The reason is that one is copied from An Yuan Misao's "Industry and Raw Materials of China", and the other is copied from Xu Dixing's "On Bureaucratic Capital". As for the places where errors are inherited, we only need to give one example: when the author analyzed "the Treaty of Nanjing broke the restriction of Chinese tariffs on foreign goods", he said: "British goods, once taxed in Hong Kong according to regulations, can run unimpeded in the Chinese mainland" (page 45), which is inherited an error in the book "History of the Chinese National Liberation Movement". In addition, the author even made many mistakes in the simple work of copying. For example, he said that the "consular jurisdiction of capitalist powers in China" (page 47) was first established by the Treaty of Tianjin, but at the same time he said that the "Sino-US and Sino-French treaties" signed with the United States and France in 1844 "determined the consular jurisdiction of the United States and France in China" (page 44). Comparing these two places with the "History of the Chinese National Liberation Movement" (pages 122 and 254), it can be known that this is not only plagiarism, but also erroneous plagiarism!
    Because the author did not seriously study Chairman Mao's works; because the author adopted such an unserious attitude towards his research work, so despite the author's repeated emphasis on the importance of using new viewpoints and methods to study modern Chinese economic history, this book actually completely failed to achieve his stated goals. Although it emphasizes "how imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism... exploit the broad masses of the Chinese people through unequal exchange, investment, heavy rent, heavy taxes, public bonds, usury, and inflation" (see content summary), the author's explanation is extremely superficial. For example, when explaining the Kuomintang's inflation, the author specifically pointed out two "methods": "One is that the Ministry of Finance borrows from the Central Bank on credit, and the other is to issue public bonds and hand them over to the four banks or the Central Bank for advance loans." (page 258). Everyone knows that the so-called "borrowing on credit" and "advance loans" are actually just a guise. Secondly, when criticizing the Kuomintang's policy of issuing public bonds during the Anti-Japanese War, the author specifically pointed out that "most of them were not publicly issued", and "the position of internal debt in wartime finance is not very important" (all the above are from page 262). It seems that if it were publicly issued, or if internal debt occupied an important position in wartime finance, it would be a good financial policy. This simple economic analysis reflects the author's position. For example, in the chapter "Rural Economy in the KMT-controlled Areas in the Anti-People Civil War", the author concluded based on the "statistics of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" that "if the work of relieving disaster areas is not stepped up, 30 million Chinese people will die of famine" (page 334). Is it that if the "work of relieving disaster areas is stepped up," the people in the KMT-controlled areas will not "die of famine" or will "die of famine" less? Isn't this a megaphone for the US imperialists? Since the author has this viewpoint, when he commented on the "Rural Reconstruction Movement" before the Anti-Japanese War, he said "except for Zouping and Dingxian, the rural reconstruction work in other places... all ended in failure" (page 180). However, the author's evaluation of Zouping and Dingxian is completely wrong. In Dingxian, which was ruled by Yan Yangchu's gang of American imperialism's running dogs, there were 46,000 indebted households and 2,000 bankruptcies due to debt (see "Folk" issue 1 published before the Anti-Japanese War), isn't this a fact?
    Finally, the organization and arrangement of this book lacks system. Some only have titles but no content, and some repeat the same content in various chapters. As for the errors in historical facts and the ambiguity of meaning, it shows the author's crude style. For example, Yizhong Tobacco Company is called "Anglo-American joint venture" (page 330); "Germany obtained the rights of the Qinyu Railway in 1914" (page 112); for example, the estimate of American imperialism's smuggling in China after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War actually used the estimate of Yishibao in 1936 (page 346). In addition, there are countless places where there are contradictions before and after. For example, the monthly expenditure figures of the Kuomintang reactionary government in 1944 are contradictory on pages 252 and 262; the same British imperialist financial invasion institution is called "Far East Bank" on page 90 and "Oriental Bank" on page 92. There are many examples, and there is no end to them.
    Chairman Mao said: "The economic history of the past century, the political history of the past century, the military history of the past century, and the cultural history of the past century, no one has seriously started to study." He pointed out: "We should first do analytical research on several departments of economic history, political history, military history, and cultural history, and then it is possible to do comprehensive research." Although Chairman Mao's words were spoken eleven years ago, they are still the pointer for every researcher engaged in the study of modern Chinese history today. Meng Xianzhang does not seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, does not strive to analyze modern Chinese economic historical materials, and does not conduct independent thinking, but writes with a stealing, plagiarizing, and crudely manufactured attitude. This approach is most undesirable, and I hope he will thoroughly correct it as soon as possible. And I hope that those engaged in the study of modern Chinese history can implement Chairman Mao's instructions eleven years ago, adopt the method of concentrating talents, dividing labor, and cooperating, and jointly research and write some books with correct content and detailed materials to meet the current needs.

    一本粗制滥造错误百出的书
    ——评孟宪章著的中国近代经济史教程
    汪敬虞
    中华书局出版  一九五一年九月
    孟宪章著的“中国近代经济史教程”，是全国解放以后第一本以中国近代经济史为题而出现的专书。它的内容提要，揭橥了“用唯物辩证法，对百余年间的半封建半殖民地经济，加以系统的叙述”的目标。作者在自序里面，更缕列了许多过去中国社会经济史的研究和著作，并着重说明“根据中国经济学者荜路蓝褛，辛勤钻研的一点成绩，整理出一部正确的详尽的中国近代经济史”的重要。然而事实上这是一本有严重政治错误的书，它是用极不严肃的态度写出来的。
    首先，作者没有认真学习毛主席对中国近代社会性质的分析，因此，研究中国近代经济史的首要条件便没有具备。作者虽然征引了一些毛主席的字句，但是在很多地方，却违背了这些字句的实质。许多错误和似是而非的论断，便从这里产生出来。例如在说明小资产阶级的经济地位时，作者说：“各种类型的小资产阶级，……他们同工农大众一样，都受三重压迫”（第一三九页）。在说明小资产阶级“是革命的动力之一，是无产阶级的可靠的同盟者”时，他说：“知识分子群与青年学生群……从辛亥革命前的留学生运动起，历次群众运动，都无不有他们参加指导。”（第一三九页）。他把五四运动和戊戌变法、辛亥革命并列，认为它们同属于“过去旧民主主义革命阶段”（第二九页）。他说，中国的资产阶级，曾经在五四运动中，“表现过他们的主导力量”（第二九页），但已不能“使之转变为资产阶级性的民主革命，完成辛亥革命所未完成的任务”（第一一七页），于是“五四运动在民族解放运动过程中，不能不承认为流产了。”（第一一八页）
    “以后的‘五卅’运动，北伐战争，土地革命……直到人民解放战争，这种资产阶级性的革命运动……已不是由富有脆弱性、妥协性的资产阶级所单独领导。”（第三八五页）这些似是而非的说明，都是在实质上违背了毛主席对历史所作的科学论断的。此外，作者把中国革命之所以需要两个步骤，归结为“一般经济落后国家，它不仅患正当经营的不均，更其患寡”（第三八四页）。对新民主主义经济之所以必需，作了极其庸俗的解释。如说四大家族“为中国新民主主义国家经济积累了很大的资本”（第三一八页），日俄战争“给东亚民族以鼓舞”（第七八页）；说鸦片战争“并不算得是怎样了不起的奇耻大辱”，把中国由封建社会降为半封建半殖民地，称之为“革命”（以上均见第二六页）。这些提法，都是有问题的。至于他以四个民主阶级为人民，而以“被剥夺政治权利的一般并未丧失国籍的反动分子、封建地主、官僚资本家”为国民（三九○页），则更充分表示作者的无知了。
    其次，提要中说，这书“另一方面，叙述在中共领导下的革命民主政权如何正确的领导人民……为摧毁旧生产关系和建立新民主主义经济制度而奋斗。对于抗战期间及胜利之后解放区与蒋管区经济之适成一尖锐对照情形，尤有详尽的叙述”。但作者对担任这一工作的条件，是完全不具备的。他不但不能掌握新民主主义经济的发展过程，甚至连对人民民主政权在各个时期的基本经济政策，都没有理解。这一点集中表现在他对土地政策的认识上。虽然他用了相当大的篇幅说明这个问题，但他的认识却是非常模糊而零乱的。只须举一个例：他在阐述毛主席在晋绥干部会议上的讲话时，竟丢掉“除了可以和应当惩办那些为广大人民群众所痛恨的查有实据的罪大恶极的反革命分子和恶霸分子外”一句，只留下“坚决主张必须对一切人的宽大政策”一句（第三七七页）。此外，在阐述抗战期间人民民主政权的财政政策时，他说：“新民主主义财政的特点，就是在于用百分之九十的力量，为人民服务，替人民解决生产上的问题，然后只用百分之十的力量，去向人民要东西。”（第二六七页）这种说法，是十分谬误的。这里所提的“用百分之九十的力量，为人民服务……然后用百分之十的力量，去向人民要东西”，是从毛主席在一九四二年所写的“经济问题与财政问题”一书中抄来的（抄的也不是原句）。但是，毛主席当时是作为群众观点问题来讲的；孟宪章把它当作“新民主主义财政的特点”来提，这是一种无知的歪曲。
    我们说作者对待“中国近代经济史教程”的写作，采取了不严肃的态度，还表现在他的大胆的抄袭作风上。这本书实际上是东抄西袭拼凑而成的作品。（令人惊异的是由鸦片战争到第一次国内革命战争，大部分可以说是华岗的“中国民族解放运动史”和胡华的“中国新民主主义革命史”两书的摘录。）因此它在观点上，在史实的处理上，有许多地方，因袭错误，前后矛盾。例如大生纱厂、华盛纱厂、日晖织呢厂、博山玻璃公司、耀徐玻璃公司、醴陵瓷业公司、景德镇瓷器公司、中兴煤矿公司等，先称为“民族企业”（第八○—八一页），后又划归“官僚资本”（第九四页）。为什么会前后矛盾呢？原因是一抄自安原美佐雄的“支那之工业与原料”，一抄自许涤新的“官僚资本论”。至于因袭错误的地方，我们也只须举一个例子：作者在分析“南京条约打破了中国关税对于外货的限制”时，说道：“英国的货物，一经在香港按例纳税后，即可在中国内地运行无阻”（第四五页），这是因袭了“中国民族解放运动史”一书中的一个错误。此外，作者甚至在单纯地抄袭工作上，也产生了很多错误。如他既说“资本主义列强在华的领事裁判权”（第四七页）是由天津条约首先创立，却同时又说一八四四年“与美法签订”的“中美中法两约，确定美法两国在中国的领事裁判权”（第四四页），拿这两处和“中国民族解放运动史”（第一二二页与第二五四页）对照，便知道这不仅是抄袭，而且是错误的抄袭！
    由于作者没有认真学习毛主席的著作；由于作者对待他的研究工作，采取了这样不严肃的态度，所以尽管作者一再强调用新的观点和方法来研究中国近代经济史的重要，他这本书实际上完全没有达到他所悬的目标。它虽然着重说明“帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义………如何透过不等价交换、投资、重租、重税、公债、高利贷、通货膨胀等方式，以压榨剥削中国广大人民”（见内容提要），但作者的说明，是极其表面的。例如作者在说明国民党的通货膨胀时，特别指出两种“方式”：“一是由财政部向中央银行赊借，二是发行公债交由四行或央行垫借。”（第二五八页）人人都知道所谓“赊借”、“垫借”，实际上都是一个幌子。其次，作者在批判国民党在抗战时期发行公债的政策时，特别指出“其中极大部分，亦并没公开发行”，“内战在战时财政所占的地位，是并不怎样重要的”（以上均见第二六二页）。好像如果公开发行了，或者内债在战时财政中占了重要的地位了，就是好的财政政策了。这种单纯的经济分析，反映出了作者的立场。如在“反人民内战中蒋管区的农村经济”一章中，作者根据“联合国善后救济总署统计”得出“若救济灾区工作不加紧进行，则中国人民之死于饥馑者将达三千万人”的结论（第三三四页）。是不是“加紧进行”了，蒋管区的人民就不会“死于饥馑”或者“死于饥馑”的要少一些呢？这不是美帝国主义者的传声筒是什么呢？作者既然有了这个观点，所以在他评论抗战以前的“乡村改良运动”时，就说“除邹平、定县外，其他各地乡村改良工作……结果都归失败”的话来（第一八○页）。然而作者对邹平、定县的评价是完全错误的，美帝国主义的走狗晏阳初这一派人统治下的定县，欠债者达四万六千户，因债务而破产者达二千家（参阅抗战前出版的“民间”第一期），这难道不是事实吗？
    最后，这本书的组织编排，缺乏系统，有的只有题目而无内容，有的则同一内容，在各章节中互相重复。至于史实的错误，含义的模糊，则更表示作者粗枝大叶的作风。如称颐中烟草公司为“英美合营”（第三三○页）；“德国于一九一四年获得钦渝等路权利”（第一一二页）；如估计抗战胜利后美帝国主义在中国的走私，竟用了益世报一九三六年的估计（第三四六页）。此外，前后互相抵触之处，更不胜枚举。如国民党反动政府在一九四四年的每月支出数字，在第二五二页和第二六二页是互相抵触的；同一个英帝国主义的金融侵略机构，在第九十页称为“远东银行”，在第九二页称为“东方银行”。例子很多，不一而足。
    毛主席说：“近百年的经济史，近百年的政治史，近百年的军事史，近百年的文化史，简直还没有人认真动手去研究。”他指出：“应先作经济史、政治史、军事史、文化史几个部门的分析研究，然后才有可能作综合研究。”毛主席的话，虽然是在十一年以前讲的，但是到今天还是每一个从事中国近代史的研究工作者的指针。孟宪章不认真研究毛泽东思想，不努力分析中国近代经济史料，不进行独立的思考，却用偷巧的、抄袭的、粗制滥造的态度来写作，这样做法是最要不得的，我希望他赶快彻底纠正。并望从事中国近代史研究的工作者能够执行毛主席十一年前的指示，采取集中人材，分工合作的方法，共同研究，写出一些内容正确、材料翔实的书籍来，以满足当前的需要。
