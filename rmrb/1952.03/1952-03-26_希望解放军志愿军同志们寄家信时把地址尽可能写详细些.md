Letter Excerpts

    Hope that when the PLA and Volunteer Army comrades send letters home, they will write the address as detailed as possible.
    We are doing preferential treatment work. We often receive revolutionary soldier certificates, merit citations, good news reports, and various letters sent home by comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army or the Volunteer Army, but we cannot deliver them. The names of the districts and townships to which the families of some PLA and Volunteer Army comrades belong have changed, and some of the letters sent by comrades have a county but no village on the envelope, or a village but no district or township. Therefore, despite many inquiries, we still cannot find the addresses of the families of the relevant comrades. We hope that comrades will write the address as detailed as possible when sending letters home in the future. If the name of the area cannot be given, you can write: in what direction from the county seat, how far, how close to which market town. It is best to write clearly which district, which township, which village.

专栏：来信摘要

    希望解放军志愿军同志们寄家信时把地址尽可能写详细些
    我们是做优抚工作的。我们常常接到中国人民解放军或志愿军同志们寄回家的革命军人证书、立功、报喜以及各种信件，但无法递交。有的解放军、志愿军同志们家庭所属区乡的名称改变了，有的同志所投寄的信件，封面上有县无村，或有村无区乡，所以我们虽经多方了解，仍然找不到各有关同志们家属的住址。希望同志们今后寄信件回家时，把地址尽可能写详细些。如果地区的名称叫不出，可以写：在县城的何方，多远，距何集近。最好写清某区、某乡、某村。
