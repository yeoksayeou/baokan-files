Embezzlers Li Laiying and Others of the Beijing Construction Bureau

Arrested and Prosecuted for Refusing to Confess Despite Small Embezzled Amounts

Wang Shusheng and Others Thoroughly Confess and Perform Meritorious Service to Atone for Their Crimes, Will Be Treated Leniently

At the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau's meeting on March 17th to handle embezzlers, Li Laiying and Li Xirui, embezzlers who refused to confess and believed in the "offensive-defensive alliance," were arrested on the spot. This measure once again warned embezzlers that no matter how much they embezzled, if they did not honestly confess their crimes and attempted to resist the anti-corruption movement with a reactionary "offensive-defensive alliance," they would not escape the people's justice. The People's Government will impose severe legal sanctions.

Embezzler Li Laiying worked in the Third Works Section of the Road Engineering Office of the Construction Bureau. In the construction of various highways in Beijing, he consistently engaged in embezzlement and fraud by "reporting small labor as large labor," stealing and selling cement, and accepting bribes from merchants. The total amount embezzled was over 30 million yuan. If he had confessed his crimes honestly, he could have been exempt from criminal punishment. However, from the beginning of the "Three-Anti" movement until his arrest, he refused to confess any problems. Before February 6th, he pretended to be active in an attempt to get away with it. At the same time, he and embezzler Wang Shusheng formed an "offensive-defensive alliance," agreeing to resolutely not confess and promising that even if they confessed themselves, they would not reveal others.

After the public trial of major embezzlers at Zhongshan Park on February 1st, many embezzlers began to confess their problems. But Li Laiying remained silent, pretending to be calm. Later, after the patient persuasion of comrades in the group, he finally confessed some small problems on February 6th, but his attitude was still very dishonest. He would confess in the morning and deny it in the afternoon; confess in the afternoon and deny it at night, reversing his statements more than thirty times. The workers were so angry that they said, "This guy is like a rubber man, impossible to cook or steam through. Let's just ignore him and punish him according to the facts."

After investigation and accusations from other embezzlers, the leadership fully grasped the materials about him and clearly told him that Wang Shusheng had already confessed and the "offensive-defensive alliance" had collapsed. But he continued to deny it. Only when others specifically raised his embezzlement activities at the Tiananmen construction site and the Xizhimen construction site was he forced to admit that he had accepted a bribe of 800,000 yuan from the Yuan Da Construction Factory at the Tiananmen construction site. In more than ten days, he confessed to over 10 million yuan of embezzled materials. But soon he denied it again, only admitting to stealing and selling six bags of cement.

On March 8th, the Construction Bureau held a meeting to once again persuade and educate the embezzlers, pointing out the path for them and asking them to write materials on the spot. Li Laiying also wrote materials at this meeting, admitting to embezzling seven or eight million yuan. But as soon as he returned to the works section, he said it was all nonsense. Until the day before his arrest, he still refused to confess his problems and even submitted a conclusion, guaranteeing that besides the six bags of cement, there were no more embezzlement activities.

Another embezzler who was arrested and prosecuted was Li Xirui, a production recorder at the First Branch of the Construction Bureau's Brick Kiln Factory. He colluded with Shang Jianqiao, the administrator of the First Branch, and Feng Tinghe, the director of the rotary kiln workshop, to steal and sell public bricks, and successively divided the spoils of more than 60 million yuan. After the anti-corruption movement began last December, they agreed with each other that "no one should confess." He only confessed some small problems, trying to muddle through. In early February, when the Beijing Municipal Construction Bureau sent an inspection team to the Brick Kiln Factory to help with the work, he and several other embezzlers felt the seriousness of the problem and held a secret meeting to form an "offensive-defensive alliance." Li Xirui said, "Don't panic, the movement will pass quickly." Therefore, during the movement, he stubbornly refused to admit his crimes and pretended to be an activist, pretending to mobilize other embezzlers to confess.

As the movement deepened, embezzler Shang Jianqiao confessed to his formation of the "offensive-defensive alliance" and his embezzlement, and also reported Li Xirui's embezzlement activities. The personnel of the Brick Kiln Factory used meetings, both large and small, and individual talks to urge Li Xirui to confess. Shang Jianqiao even pointed at Li Xirui at a meeting and said, "I have talked about my affairs with you, you must confess well!" However, Li Xirui still refused to confess. At the last meeting, he confessed two things to the inspection team. One was that he stole and sold 30,000 bricks, and he got 3 million yuan; the other was that he stole and sold 20,000 bricks, and he got 2 million yuan. When the inspection team pointed out that both of these numbers were wrong, he said, "My problem cannot be right, because I have never stolen and sold bricks." He has been using this rogue method to resist the movement.

At the Construction Bureau's meeting on March 8th, Li Xirui also only wrote about two small things. At the second meeting when he was asked to write materials, he still did not confess anything and submitted a conclusion.

Based on the above situation, the Construction Bureau's Savings and Inspection Committee believes that the stubborn attitude of these two embezzlers shows that although the amount of embezzlement is not very large, they have no remorse, so it was decided to send them to the Beijing Municipal People's Court for severe punishment according to law. However, embezzlers such as Wang Shusheng and Shang Jianqiao, who thoroughly confessed their embezzlement activities and were able to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, were recommended to the People's Court for lenient treatment.

### 北京市建设局贪污分子李来英等  贪污数目不大拒不坦白被捕法办  王树声等彻底坦白并戴罪立功将予以从宽处理

    北京市建设局贪污分子李来英等
    贪污数目不大拒不坦白被捕法办
    王树声等彻底坦白并戴罪立功将予以从宽处理
    北京市人民政府建设局三月十七日召开的处理贪污分子大会上，拒不坦白、迷信“攻守同盟”的贪污分子李来英和李锡瑞被当场逮捕。这一措施，再次向贪污分子发出警告：不管他们贪污数字多少，如果不老老实实地坦白认罪，而企图以反动的“攻守同盟”来抵抗反贪污运动，一定不能逃脱人民的法网。人民政府一定予以严厉的法律处分。
    贪污分子李来英，在建设局道路工程事务所第三工务所工作。在修建北京市各公路工程中，他一贯地利用“小工报大工”、盗卖洋灰、接受商人贿赂等方式进行贪污舞弊。贪污总数三千余万元。他如果坦白认罪，本来可以免受刑事处分的。但是，从
    “三反”运动开始一直到被捕，他什么问题都不肯交代。二月六日以前，他曾假装积极，企图混过关去。同时他和贪污分子王树声订立“攻守同盟”，相约坚决不坦白，并相约即使自己坦白，也不说出别人。
    二月一日中山公园公审大贪污分子大会后，不少贪污分子开始交代自己的问题。但李来英却一声不响，故作镇静。后来经过小组同志耐心劝导，他到二月六日才交代了一些小问题，态度仍然很不老实。上午坦白，下午推翻；下午坦白，夜里推翻，前后共推翻三十多次。气得工人们说：“这家伙是个胶皮人，煮不熟，蒸不烂。大家都不管他。根据事实惩办就得了。”
    经过调查和其他贪污分子检举，领导上完全掌握了他的材料，并明确地告诉他王树声已经坦白了，“攻守同盟”破产了。但他一直抵赖。别人具体提出他在天安门工地和西直门工地的贪污行为，他才又被迫承认在天安门工地时，接受元大营造厂八十万元的贿赂。十多天共谈出一千多万元的贪污材料。但是不久他又推翻了。只承认盗卖过六袋洋灰。
    三月八日，建设局召开大会，对贪污分子再次进行说服教育，给他们指出道路，并要他们当场写材料。李来英在这个会上也写了材料，承认贪污七、八百万元。但他一回到工务所就说是瞎写的。一直到逮捕的前一天，他仍然拒不交代自己的问题，并且还具了结，保证除了六袋洋灰之外，再无贪污行为。
    另一个被逮捕法办的贪污分子，是建设局砖窑厂第一分厂的生产记录员李锡瑞。他和一分厂管理员商健樵、转盘窑车间主任冯亭河等互相勾结，盗卖公家的砖，先后共分到赃款六千多万元。去年十二月反贪污运动开始以后，他们就互相约定，“谁都不准坦白”。他只交代一些小问题，企图混过去。二月初，北京市建设局派检查组到砖窑厂帮助工作时，他和另外几个贪污分子感到问题严重，开了一个秘密会，订立“攻守同盟”。李锡瑞说：“不要着慌，运动很快就过去了。”于是，他在运动中对自己的罪行坚不吐实，并装做积极分子，假意去动员其他贪污分子坦白。
    随着运动的深入，贪污分子商健樵坦白了他订立“攻守同盟”和贪污的事实，并且检举了李锡瑞的贪污行为。砖窑厂的人员利用大会、小会和个别谈话来督促李锡瑞坦白。商健樵并在大会上指着李锡瑞说：“我和你们的事情都谈出来了，你要好好交代！”但是，李锡瑞仍不坦白。最后一次大会，他向检查组交代了两件事。一件是盗卖了三万块砖，他分了三百万元；另一件是盗卖了两万块砖，他分了二百万元。当检查组指出这两个数目都不对时，他又说：“我的问题对不了，因为我没有盗卖过砖。”他一直用这种无赖手段来抗拒运动。
    在三月八日建设局大会中李锡瑞也只写了两件小事情。在第二次大会上要他写材料时，他仍然什么都不交代，并且具了结。
    根据以上情况，建设局节约检查委员会认为这两个贪污分子的顽抗态度，说明他们虽然贪污数字不很大，但毫无悔过之心，所以决定送交北京市人民法院依法严惩。而对彻底坦白了自己的贪污行为，并能戴罪立功的王树声、商健樵等贪污分子，则提请人民法院予以从宽处理。（建白）
