To the Editor:
    Liu Ximei (a Youth League member), a spinning worker at our factory, Qingdao State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4, has created a scientific knotting method without flyaway fibers. In the past, the knotting methods for spinning all followed the so-called "standard knotting method" imported from foreign countries. The movements were very complex, and they produced flyaway fibers and knots, which had a certain adverse effect on the quality of the yarn. The knotting method created by Liu Ximei has simple movements. When knotting, after pulling out the bobbin, the thumb and index finger of the right hand find the head and pinch it (with the head end exposed by about five fen). Extend the middle finger to tension the yarn, and at the same time, hook the middle finger onto the steel wire ring. At this point, the middle finger naturally retracts, and the thumb and index finger pick up the head and knot it. This not only eliminates the two movements of winding a loop and pinching the head, but also saves flyaway fibers, eliminates knotted yarn, and improves quality. Our factory currently produces six pounds of knotting flyaway fibers per day and night. After adopting Liu Ximei's working method, at least 1,600 pounds of flyaway fibers will be saved per year. Also, because the thread ends are not pinched, the thread ends in the roving waste can be completely eliminated, so that the roving waste can also be used to spin 10-count yarn.

    青岛国棉四厂刘希美
    创造无回丝的接头工作法
    编辑同志：我们厂的细纱女工刘希美（青年团员），创造了科学的无回丝接头工作法。过去细纱的接头方法，都习用从外国传来的所谓“标准接头法”，动作很复杂，又出回丝，又有疙瘩，对纱的品质有一定的不良影响。刘希美创造的接头方法，动作简单。接头时拔纱管后，右手拇、食两指即找头捏住（头端露出约五英分），伸中指紧张纱条，同时中指找钢丝啳钩上，此时中指自然缩回，拇、食两指即提头接上。这不但能省去挽圈搯头两动作，并且能节省回丝，消灭疙瘩纱，提高品质。我厂目前一昼夜出接头回丝六磅，采取刘希美工作法后，一年至少要节省回丝一千六百磅。又因不搯线头，可彻底消灭细纱地脚花中的线头，使地脚花也可以用来纺十支纱。青岛国棉四厂
