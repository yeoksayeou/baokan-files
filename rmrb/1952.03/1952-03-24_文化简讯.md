    Cultural Briefs
    ▲ Under the call of the Central South China Literary and Art Circles Federation and the Propaganda Department of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in coordination with the Cultural Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee and the Propaganda Office of the Wuhan Anti-Corruption Joint Inspection Committee, a group of literary and art workers was organized to participate in Wuhan's anti-theft movement. The purpose was to experience life, transform their thinking, and promptly create a batch of theatrical, artistic, and musical works reflecting the anti-theft movement. This aimed to provide materials for propaganda activities in various places during the anti-theft movement.
    This group of literary and art workers has been assembled since March 18th. Wang Renzhong, Director of the Wuhan Anti-Corruption Joint Inspection Committee, gave them principled and specific instructions on the significance of mobilizing the worker masses in the anti-theft movement, how to mobilize the worker masses, and how to carry out creative activities.
    This participation of literary and art workers in the movement for creation is organized and led. Yu Heiding, Vice Chairman of the Central South Literary Federation, Cui Wei, President of the Central South Academy of Arts, and Wang Tianduo, Director of the Propaganda Office of the Wuhan Anti-Corruption Joint Inspection Committee, are directly leading this creative endeavor. Drama and fine arts groups have now been formally organized. In music, Sha Lai will organize some comrades to create works. In addition, some literary and art workers will directly participate in the "tiger-beating" battle while also writing short articles and performance materials.

    ▲中南文学艺术界联合会在中共中央中南局宣传部号召之下，协同中南军政委员会文化部、武汉市反贪污联合检查委员会宣传处，组织了一批文艺工作者参加武汉市的反盗窃运动，以体验生活，改造思想，并及时地创作出一批反映反盗窃运动的戏剧、美术、音乐作品，以供各地在反盗窃运动中进行宣传活动的需要。
    这批文艺工作者已在三月十八日集中起来。武汉市反贪污联合检查委员会主任王任重就反盗窃运动中发动工人群众的意义，和如何发动工人群众，以及如何进行创作活动等问题，对他们作了原则而又具体的指示。
    这次文艺工作者参加运动进行创作是有组织有领导地进行的。中南文联副主席于黑丁、中南文艺学院院长崔嵬、武汉市反贪污联合检查委员会宣传处处长王天铎等直接领导这次创作。现在已经正式组织了戏剧、美术两个组。音乐方面则将由莎莱组织一部分同志进行创作。此外，还有一部分文艺工作者将要一面直接参加“打虎”战斗，同时也要写一些短小的文章和演唱材料。
