    Suggestions to Overcome Waste of Telegrams and Telephones in Government Offices
    Editor: I have some opinions on the waste of telegrams and telephones in government offices.

    From May to October 1951, the China Petroleum Corporation's average monthly telegram and telephone expenses were 46 million yuan; after responding to the "increase production and practice thrift" campaign in November, it was reduced to 16.5 million yuan per month. It can be seen that the previous waste figures were very alarming. This waste was caused by the staff's lack of attention to the people's property and the bureaucratic style of leading cadres who signed off on everything. We once made three long-distance calls to a certain agency in the Northeast in one day, and also sent a telegram of about 150 words. Some long-distance calls had "talking times" exceeding 15 minutes. These wasteful situations are worthy of attention by every state organ and every staff member. In order to overcome these wasteful phenomena, I suggest: 1. In future telegrams, those words and phrases that can be omitted should be deleted as much as possible; 2. When using long-distance telephones, the matters to be discussed should be fully prepared in advance; the time should be calculated carefully. Under the principle of not delaying urgent official business, letters should be used to replace telegrams and long-distance calls as much as possible.　Long Zixun

    建议克服机关中使用电报、电话的浪费现象
    编辑同志：我对机关中浪费电报、电话的情形提些意见。
    一九五一年五月到十月，中国石油公司平均每月的电报、电话费为四千六百万元；十一月份响应“增产节约”号召之后，即降低为每月一千六百五十万元。可见以前的浪费数字是非常惊人的。这些浪费，是工作人员对人民财产不够重视，领导干部提笔就签字的官僚主义所造成的。我们曾有一天向东北某机关去过三次长途电话，还发过长约一百五十多字的电报。有的长途电话的“说话时间”竟超过十五分钟。这些浪费情形，是值得我们每一个国家机关和每一个工作人员注意的。为了克服这些浪费现象，我建议：一、在今后的电报中，应尽量删去那些可用、可不用的词句；二、使用长途电话时，应在事前把要谈的事情完全准备好；要很好地计算时间。在不耽误紧急公事的原则下，应尽量以信函代替电报和长途电话。　龙子勋
