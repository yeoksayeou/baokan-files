　　▲ Workers at the Taiyuan North Station Locomotive Section of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau have set new over-axle records on roads with many bends and steep gradients. Wang Quanyou of the 235 crew was the first to set a new record. In January, he set a new record of exceeding the axle load by 102 tons on the Saiyu to Shouyang section of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan line (8‰ gradient), breaking the idea that over-axle loading was impossible on steep gradients and roads with many bends. Thanks to Wang Quanyou's leadership, the 234 Jiang Zuotang group and the 230 group also set new over-axle records one after another. The 230 group, which had always been the most backward, actually exceeded the axle load by more than 5,000 tons in February and saved 34 tons of coal. Especially after the crackdown on the coal theft and corruption group headed by Zhao Xisan, the enthusiasm of the train attendants for production was even higher. From January to February 15, they saved a total of 1,100 tons of coal for the country. Machine tool operators Li Zixing and Lin Hongchun, who used to produce the most defective products, not only no longer produce defective products, but also repeatedly set new records in their work and doubled their work efficiency.
　　▲ As soon as the anti-corruption movement started at the state-owned Tangshan Power Plant, the Party, administration, and trade union put forward the battle slogan of "fighting tigers while producing." In the movement, the administration carefully adjusted personnel to ensure leadership over production. The workers consciously and actively participated in the anti-corruption struggle, while in production, they conscientiously implemented the safety work system and observed labor discipline. The attendance rate of all employees in the anti-corruption movement reached more than 98%, thus ensuring safe power generation and transmission. From December last year to March 4 this year, the turbine and boiler have been safely generating electricity for 577 days. Coal consumption in January and February was reduced to 0.556 kg per kilowatt-hour. Plant electricity consumption and oil consumption were also lower than the original quotas in January and February.

    ▲太原铁路分局太原北站机务段工人，在弯路多、坡度高的路上创造超轴新纪录。最先创造新纪录的，是二三五包乘组王全有。他在一月份创造了石太线赛鱼到寿阳间（千分之八的坡度）超轴一百○二吨的新纪录，打破了坡度高、弯路多不能超轴的思想。由于王全有的带头，二三四姜佐棠小组、二三○小组都先后创造超轴新纪录。二三○小组一向是最落后的，它在二月份竟超轴五千余吨，并节省三十四吨煤。尤其是突破以赵锡三为首的盗煤贪污集团以后，乘务员的生产热忱更高了。从一月份起到二月十五日止，他们共给国家节省了一千一百吨的煤。机床组李子馨和林鸿春，一贯出废品最多，现在不但不出废品了，反而在工作中屡次创造新纪录，提高工作效率一倍。
    ▲国营唐山发电厂反贪污运动一开始，党、行政和工会就提出了“一面打虎，一面生产”的战斗口号。行政方面在运动中慎重地调整了人事，保证了对生产的领导。工人们自觉地积极参加反贪污斗争，在生产中则认真执行安全工作制度，遵守劳动纪律。全厂职工在反贪污运动中出勤率达到百分之九十八以上，因此，保证了安全发电送电。自去年十二月到今年三月四日为止，汽机、锅炉已安全发电五百七十七天。一、二月份煤耗降低到每度电零点五五六公斤。厂用电和油耗在一、二月份内也都比原定额为低。
