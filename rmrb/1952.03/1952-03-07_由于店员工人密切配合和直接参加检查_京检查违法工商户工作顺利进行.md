Xinhua News Agency, March 6th. Beijing's inspection of illegal industrial and commercial households has entered a new stage thanks to the close cooperation of the vast number of shop employees and workers, and the participation of some shop employees and workers in the inspections.

As the struggle of the vast number of shop employees and workers against illegal capitalists has developed into face-to-face struggle, the third group of inspection teams dispatched by the Municipal Economy and Austerity Inspection Committee was warmly welcomed and assisted by the employees of the inspected households. When the inspection team arrived at Yu Feng He Dyeing Factory, more than fifty employees immediately gathered to express their welcome and demonstrate against the capitalist. They held a meeting of the united forces with the staff of the inspection team and handed over three ledgers of tax evasion by the factory's capitalist, providing a great deal of material. The workers also organized a "mobilization group" to mobilize senior staff to expose the capitalist's illegal activities. Workers at Guanghua Wood Factory held a "Joint Effort Meeting" with the inspection team staff, and the workers launched a competition to report violations. All seventeen workers in the factory reported more than two hundred illegal acts by the capitalist, and key members joined the inspection team to help audit the accounts. When the inspection team questioned the capitalist, workers at Yonglin Weaving Factory shouted slogans outside the window to demonstrate against the capitalist: "If you don't confess, we'll reveal your secrets." Employees of Mo Hou Cheng Well Machinery Factory helped the inspection team staff audit the accounts and questioned the capitalist. As a result, the inspection work progressed rapidly, and many groups were able to basically solve the cases within a few days.

The direct participation of shop employees and workers in the inspection teams has made the inspection work even smoother. The inspection team inspecting Xinsheng Pharmaceutical Factory had three shop employees, who used their own oppression as shop assistants to enlighten the class consciousness of the factory's workers, and introduced their struggle experience, which eliminated the workers' concerns and encouraged them to actively accuse the capitalists of their crimes. At the same time, because the shop assistants participating in the inspection team were familiar with the business, many technical problems could be solved at any time. For example, two members of the inspection team inspecting Hua Feng Construction Factory were originally construction workers. They were familiar with the inside story of shoddy workmanship and material substitution in the construction industry, which played a great role in the inspection work.

The close cooperation of shop employees and workers and their direct participation in the inspection work greatly strengthened the momentum of the inspection teams, making the illegal capitalists deeply terrified and forcing them to surrender. When the inspection team inspecting Yihe Gong Jingji Construction Factory explained the policies to the capitalist and ordered him to state his attitude, the factory's capitalist expressed his willingness to confess completely. Three days later, he automatically calculated that he had evaded more than 1 billion yuan in taxes through shoddy workmanship and material substitution in the more than 30 projects he contracted.

At the same time, because a large number of shop employees and workers participated in the inspection team work, the inspection team's lineup has also been greatly expanded. As of the 5th, the inspection teams had expanded from 325 groups in the second batch to 444 groups.

    由于店员工人密切配合和直接参加检查
    京检查违法工商户工作顺利进行
    【新华社六日讯】北京市检查违法工商户的工作，由于广大店员工人密切配合和一部分店员工人参加检查，已进入一个新的阶段。
    由于广大店员工人反对违法资本家的斗争已发展到面对面的斗争，市节约检查委员会第三批派出的检查组受到了被检查户职工的热烈欢迎和帮助。裕丰和染厂的五十多个职工在检查组到达时，马上集合起来表示欢迎并对资本家进行示威。他们和检查组的工作人员开了会师大会，同时交出了该厂资本家三本偷税的账摺，提供了许多材料。工人们并组织了“动员小组”，动员高级职员揭露资本家的违法事实。广华木厂的职工和检查组工作人员开了“齐心会”，工人们并展开了检举竞赛。全厂十七个工人，检举了资本家二百多条违法行为，骨干分子并参加检查组帮助查账。永林织布厂工人在检查组向资本家问话时，在窗外高呼口号，向资本家示威：“你不坦白，我们泄你的底。”默厚成井械厂的职工并帮助检查组的工作人员查账，对资本家进行问话。因此，检查工作进展很快，许多小组在几天之内就可以基本破案。
    店员工人直接参加检查小组，使检查工作的进行更加顺利。检查新生制药厂的检查组有三个店员工人，他们以自己当店员所受的压迫去启发该厂工人的阶级觉悟，并介绍了他们的斗争经验，使该厂职工消除了顾虑，积极控诉资本家的罪恶。同时，因为参加检查组的店员熟悉业务，许多技术问题得以随时解决。如检查华丰营造厂的检查组中有两个组员原来是营造业工人，他们熟悉营造业偷工减料的内幕，对检查工作起了很大作用。
    店员工人密切配合和直接参加检查工作，大大壮大了检查组的声势，使不法资本家深为震恐，不得不缴械。检查义和公景记营造厂的检查组向资本家交代了政策，责令资本家表明态度时，该厂资本家就表示愿意彻底坦白，三天后他自动算出他在承包的三十多件工程中偷工减料十亿多元的账目。
    同时，因为大批店员工人参加了检查组工作，检查组的阵容也更加扩大了。截至五日止，检查组已由第二批的三百二十五个组，扩大到四百四十四个组。
