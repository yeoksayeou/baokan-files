The Fundamental Reason for the Serious Right-Leaning Errors of the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee
Wu Guang, Third Secretary of the CCP Western Guangdong District Committee

Editor's Note: Regarding the serious right-leaning errors made by the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in leading urban work, this newspaper reported on it on page one of the February 19th issue. The Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Government did not rely on the working class to lead the entire urban construction work, but instead relied on the bourgeoisie. As a result, the bourgeoisie usurped the leadership of the working class in this area. This serious error was revealed in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and is now being corrected. This is an article written by Comrade Wu Guang, Third Secretary of the CCP Western Guangdong District Committee, on this issue.

The people's cities led by our Communist Party are essentially different from the cities ruled by the Kuomintang in the past. Our cities are for production, not consumption; our urban work policy is to rely on the working class, not the bourgeoisie. This kind of city and the policy of urban work conforms to the demands of the broad masses of working people. The bourgeoisie, who seek only profit, harm others for their own benefit, and engage in speculation and trickery, although verbally shout "support," try every possible means to change the nature of the city and the work policy to suit their own selfish interests. In order to achieve this goal, the bourgeoisie do not hesitate to violate the Common Program that their representatives raised their hands to pass, and launch a frenzied attack on the working class and the Communist Party with sugar-coated bullets, attempting to usurp leadership.

If this frenzied attack by the bourgeoisie is met with strong resistance or counter-attack, their conspiracy will naturally fail to materialize; if it encounters those weak-willed, unwary Communist Party or People's Government cadres, they will take an inch and advance a foot, gradually pressing forward. After completely defeating or capturing these cadres, they will change the nature of the city and the work policy according to the interests of the bourgeoisie, serving their interests.

The frenzied attack of the bourgeoisie in Jiangmen City against the Party and the people's regime is such a matter of class struggle. The Jiangmen Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party completely abandoned the Party's and the working class's position in this struggle.

Now, let's take a look at where the errors in Jiangmen City's work policy lie? What is the leading ideology of the CCP Jiangmen Municipal Committee?

First, the leading ideology of the Municipal Party Committee is not the ideology of relying on the working class, and the focus of leadership is not placed on the work of the workers. From the leadership ideology of the Municipal Party Committee to its regular activities and the use of cadre forces, it shows that the main strength, thoughts, and energy of the Municipal Party Committee are not focused on the workers. Therefore, the Municipal Party Committee knows very little about the needs of the workers, the problems that the workers themselves urgently need to solve, and the welfare of the workers, and solves even fewer of them. When problems occur among the workers, the leadership does not pay attention to them. It is said that during the construction of the Zhongshan Hall, an accident occurred and workers died, but no one cared about it. In the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, the sentencing of counter-revolutionaries was only discussed by neighborhood groups (mainly industrial and commercial households), and the opinions of the workers were not specifically solicited. The leading ideology is not clearly relying on the working class, but relying on the bourgeoisie. Some responsible cadres said: "If we don't rely on industrialists and businessmen in this place, we can't complete any tasks such as tax collection and donations." This means that some cadres ideologically believe that they can do without relying on the working class, but they cannot do without relying on the bourgeoisie. Isn't this still a serious right-leaning ideology?

Secondly, in the city's construction work, it is not primarily for the workers, but to see the needs of the bourgeoisie. For example, fearing that capitalists do not have "entertainment" venues to satisfy their extravagant lives, they are allowed to illegally extract 1.8 billion yuan from citizens (including workers and the poor) in disguise to build the so-called "Industrial and Commercial Circles Cultural Palace." However, workers and the poor do not even have housing, and some of them still live on dilapidated boats on the riverbank, and some build small houses with tree bark to shelter from the wind and rain. Ultimately, whose lives should our Communist Party care about first? And who needs our care most urgently? The Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee has not figured this out.

Jiangmen City also spent 400 million yuan to build five public toilets. The beauty of these toilets is something I have never seen in large cities I have visited, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and other places. What is even more intolerable is that today, in order to build such bourgeois foreign toilets, they ruthlessly demolish the thatched huts of poor citizens as bases for building toilets, causing these homeless people to cry and sob. This has aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses of citizens and many cadres.

Workers lack housing, and there are no clinics. What should workers do when they get sick? It was not considered. However, in order to make it convenient for capitalists to see a doctor at the North Street Hospital, a car was specially purchased. The education of workers' children is also not well taken care of. The workers reacted: "Now that we are liberated, the children still have no place to go to school." (Because there are not enough school buildings now, the workers asked the government to allocate a piece of land to build a house, but it was not allowed. Only more than 4 million yuan was given to repair the old school buildings. However, when the third People's Congress was convened, 9 million yuan was spent just on arranging the venue.) This proves that the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee did not rely on the working class, but on the bourgeoisie, and served the bourgeoisie. In the past, some people said that "the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee has a grand construction ideology." We believe that this is not a question of grand construction or small construction ideology, but a question of who to rely on and who to carry out construction for. The urban construction work in Jiangmen City relied on the bourgeoisie and was for the bourgeoisie, not for the working people.

In leading the work, the Municipal Party Committee only made unprincipled concessions to the bourgeoisie, but rarely struggled. In addition to the above-mentioned construction of the Industrial and Commercial Circles Cultural Palace, which is a clear example, the Municipal Party Committee also shielded businessmen (the director of the Federation of Industry and Commerce) from tax evasion. The responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee did not allow people to talk about the illegal event of a large businessman in Jiangmen City evading 50 billion yuan in taxes, fearing that talking about it would "hinder the united front." In Jiangmen City, the labor-management consultation meeting was only where the labor side listened to the orders of the capital side, and there was no such thing as consultation between the two sides.

The Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee handed over the work of the urban-rural liaison office to businessmen to control, and the businessmen were naturally satisfied. It is completely understandable that they simply protect the interests of businessmen and do not support land reform.

Because there is a serious right-leaning ideology in the leadership work of the Municipal Party Committee, they cannot see the strength of the working class and are afraid that nothing can be done if the capitalists do not support it. Therefore, it has fueled the arrogance of illegal capitalists. For example, the secretary of the Federation of Industry and Commerce claimed: "Our Federation of Industry and Commerce is a small municipal government."

The serious right-leaning ideology in the leadership work of the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee has won the favor of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, people shouted "Long live!" to some of our comrades and praised the united front in Jiangmen City as a "model" for the whole country. It should be understood that this is not said by the working class, but by the bourgeoisie. Some of our comrades have been defeated by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie and are still not aware of it. They do not understand that the bourgeoisie saying that our united front work is a "model" is a great irony and insult to us. If we were to put it in our own words, it should be: The united front work in Jiangmen City is a model that is used by the bourgeoisie. It is also this "model" that has completely usurped the Party's leadership in Jiangmen City by the bourgeoisie.

Due to the serious right-leaning ideology in the leadership work of the Municipal Party Committee, the thinking of many of our cadres has also been seriously problematic. For example, the cadres of the Industry and Commerce Section publicly said to the cadres of the Labor Section: "The cadres of the Labor Section represent the working class, and our Industry and Commerce Section represents the bourgeoisie." Because the leading ideology of the Municipal Party Committee lacks a clear class stand, bourgeois elements can be even more rampant and blatantly make ill-gotten gains. They even take the opportunity of the Resist America, Aid Korea donation movement to make a fortune from it. For example, when we called on the workers to step up production to donate airplanes and cannons, illegal capitalists put the income from increased production and saved raw materials by the workers into their own pockets and did not donate more. Individual comrades in the Municipal Party Committee raised objections to this situation, but the Municipal Party Committee did not pay attention to it.

The expression of the serious right-leaning ideology of the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee in the cadre policy is: those cadres who are firm in their stand and are serious and responsible to the Party and the people are not valued, while those who are good at supporting the right-leaning ideology, and even some of whom are politically suspicious, are valued instead and are considered good cadres.

What is the fundamental reason for the occurrence and long-term existence of this right-leaning error of the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee?

From the leadership's perspective, the District Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee are both responsible. We did not provide enough assistance and education to the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee. Although the District Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee sometimes put forward some opinions on the leading ideology and work policy of the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee, they did not fully understand the seriousness and harm of this frenzied attack by the bourgeoisie in Jiangmen City, and did not raise the serious right-leaning ideology in the leadership work of the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee to a principled level for criticism. Therefore, they did not better adhere to the Party's political principles and organizational line, and did not resolutely and decisively repel the frenzied attack of the bourgeoisie. However, the leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee should still bear the main responsibility. There is a lack of ideological struggle within the Municipal Party Committee, and the committee system is not well implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution. The main leaders of the Municipal Party Committee have serious individualism and meritorious service ideology, lack the organizational concept of the Party, lack Party spirit, only value themselves, despise the Party Committee, and many things are decided by individuals, requiring subordinates to be responsible to themselves instead of being responsible to the Party Committee. The tendency of the Municipal Party Committee to detach itself from politics is serious. They have never seriously engaged in study, their theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is very low, their political awareness is not high, their class stand is not stable, they lack class concepts, cannot see the strength of the working class, and do not understand who the Communist Party members should serve. Therefore, they cannot withstand the flattery of the bourgeoisie and are corrupted and captured by bourgeois ideology. This is the fundamental reason why the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee has abandoned the Party's and the working class's position, been captured by the bourgeoisie, and served the bourgeoisie.

    江门市委发生严重右倾错误的根本原因
    中国共产党粤西区党委第三书记  武光
    编者按：关于中共江门市委在领导城市工作中发生的严重右倾错误，本报在二月十九日第一版已有报道。江门市市委和市人民政府没有依靠工人阶级领导整个城市建设工作，而是依靠了资产阶级。结果使资产阶级在这个地区篡夺了工人阶级的领导权。这个严重的错误在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中被揭发出来，现已开始纠正。这是中共粤西区党委第三书记武光同志关于这一问题所写的文章。
    我们共产党领导的人民的城市，和以前国民党统治的城市有本质上的不同。我们的城市是生产的，不是消费的；我们的城市工作方针是依靠工人阶级的，不是依靠资产阶级的。这种性质的城市和城市工作的方针，是符合广大的劳动人民的要求的；唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的资产阶级虽然口头上喊“拥护”，但却千方百计地企图改变城市的这种性质和工作方针，以符合他们少数人的私利。为达到这个目的，资产阶级不惜违反他们的代表人物所举手通过的共同纲领，用糖衣炮弹向工人阶级和共产党猖狂进攻，妄图篡夺领导权。
    资产阶级的这种猖狂进攻，若是遭受到坚强的抵抗或反攻，他们的阴谋自然无法实现；若是碰到那些意志薄弱，不知警惕的共产党的或人民政府的干部，他们就得寸进尺，步步进逼，在完全击败或俘掳了这些干部之后，就按照资产阶级的利益，改变城市的性质和工作方针，为他们的利益服务。
    江门市的资产阶级对党和人民政权的猖狂进攻，就是这样的阶级斗争的问题。中国共产党江门市委员会在这个斗争中完全离开了党的、工人阶级的立场。
    现在，我们来看看江门市的工作方针错误在什么地方？中共江门市委的领导思想是什么思想？
    首先，市委的领导思想，不是依靠工人阶级的思想，领导重心未放到工人工作上。从市委的领导思想到经常的活动，以及干部力量的使用，都说明市委的主要力量、思想、精力都未放在工人身上。因此，对工人的需要，工人本身迫切要求解决的问题，工人的福利，市委知道得很少，解决得更少。工人中发生了问题，领导方面不重视。据说在修建中山堂的时候，曾发生过事故，死过工人，而未有人过问。在镇压反革命运动中，对反革命分子的量刑，只经过街坊小组（其中主要是工商户）的讨论，未专门征求过工人的意见。领导思想上不是明确地依靠工人阶级，而是依靠了资产阶级。有的负责干部这样说：“在这地方如果不依靠工商业家，税收、捐献等什么任务都完成不了。”这就是说，有些干部在思想上认为可以不依靠工人阶级，但却不能不依靠资产阶级。难道这还不是严重的右倾思想吗？
    其次，在城市的建设工作上也不是首先为了工人，而是看资产阶级的需要。譬如怕资本家没有满足奢侈生活的“娱乐”场所，就允许他们非法地向市民（包括工人、贫民在内）变相地抽税十八亿元来修建所谓“工商界文化宫”。而工人、贫民则连住房也没有，他们有的还住在江边的破船上，有的用树皮搭个小屋以避风雨。究竟我们共产党应该首先关心什么人的生活？谁又是最迫切需要我们关心的呢？这一点，江门市委是没有弄清楚的。
    江门市还化了四亿元修了五个公共厕所，这些厕所的漂亮程度，是我所曾到过的大城市如北京、天津、南京、汉口、广州、青岛等地还未见过的。更不能容忍的是，在今天为了修这样资产阶级化的洋厕所，又狠心地拆去穷苦市民的茅屋作建厕基地，致使这些无家可归的人哭哭啼啼。这引起了广大市民和不少干部的不满。
    工人既缺乏住房，也没有诊疗所，工人生了病如何办？没有被考虑。但为了照顾资本家到北街医院看病方便，却专门买了一辆汽车。工人子弟读书的事情照顾得也不够。工人反应：“现在解放了，孩子们还没有地方去上学。”（因为现在校舍不够，工人要求政府拨块地皮盖房子，没有得到允许，只给了四百多万元作补修旧校舍之用。而召开第三届人民代表会议时，仅只布置会场倒用了九百万元。）这证明了江门市委没有依靠工人阶级，而是依靠了资产阶级，是为资产阶级服务的。过去有人说“江门市委是大建设思想”，我们认为这不是什么大建设、小建设思想的问题，而是依靠谁，为了谁进行建设的问题。江门市的城市建设工作是依靠了资产阶级，为了资产阶级，而不是为了劳动人民。
    市委在领导工作上，对资产阶级只有无原则的让步，却少有斗争。除上述的修建工商界文化宫的事情乃是一个显明的例证外，市委还包庇商人（工商联主任）漏税。对江门市大商人漏税五百亿元的违法事件，市委负责同志不让讲，怕讲出去“妨碍统一战线”。劳资协商会议，在江门市则只是劳方听资方之命，无所谓双方协商。
    城乡联络处的工作，江门市委竟交给商人掌握，商人自然是得其所哉。他们单纯保护商人利益，不支持土地改革，那是完全可以理解的。
    由于市委领导工作上存在着严重的右倾思想，看不到工人阶级的力量，事事怕资本家不支持就做不成，于是就助长了违法资本家的威风。如工商联秘书自称：“我们工商联就是小市政府。”
    江门市委领导工作上的严重右倾思想，博得了资产阶级的欢心，于是乎，人家喊我们的某些同志“万岁！”又誉称江门市的统一战线是全国的“模范”。应该懂得，这不是工人阶级讲的，而是资产阶级讲的。我们有些同志已经被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹所打倒而尚不自觉，他们不懂得资产阶级说我们的统一战线工作是“模范”，这是对我们的莫大讽刺和污辱。如果换成我们自己的话说，应该是：江门市的统一战线工作是为资产阶级所利用的模范。也就是这种“模范”，使党在江门市的领导权完全被资产阶级所篡夺。
    由于市委领导工作上存在着严重的右倾思想，也就使我们许多干部的思想发生了严重问题。例如工商科的干部就曾公开地对劳动科的干部说：“劳动科的干部是代表工人阶级的，我们工商科是代表资产阶级的。”由于市委领导思想上缺乏鲜明的阶级立场，资产阶级分子就能够更加猖狂地、明目张胆地大发其不义之财，他们竟连抗美援朝捐献运动的机会也不放过，从中捞一把。如我们号召工人加紧生产来捐献飞机大炮时，违法资本家就把工人增加生产、节省原料得来的收入装入了自己的腰包，并没有更多地捐献。市委有个别同志对这种情况提出意见，但市委会并未重视。
    江门市委的严重右倾思想在干部政策上的表现是：那些立场坚定、对党对人民认真负责的干部不被重视，而那些善于对右倾思想捧场的，甚至其中有的是政治上的嫌疑分子，反而被重视，被认为是好干部。
    江门市委的这种右倾错误所以发生和长期存在的根本原因是什么呢？
    从领导方面检查，区党委、地委都有责任。我们对江门市委的帮助教育不够。虽然有时区党委、地委对江门市委的领导思想和工作方针也提出一些意见，但对江门市资产阶级这一猖狂进攻的严重性和危害性认识不足，对江门市委领导工作上的严重右倾思想没有提高到原则的高度进行批判，因而没有更好地坚持党的政治原则和组织路线，没有及时地、坚决地打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。但是，市委领导同志仍应负主要的责任。市委内部缺乏思想斗争，没有很好地依照党章的规定执行党委制。市委主要领导人有着严重的个人主义和功臣思想，缺乏党的组织观念，缺乏党性，只看重自己，轻视党委会，很多事情都是个人决定，要下级对自己负责，而不是对党委会负责。市委的脱离政治的倾向是严重的。他们从未认真进行学习，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的理论水平很低，政治觉悟不高，阶级立场不稳，缺乏阶级观点，看不到工人阶级的力量，不懂得共产党员应该为谁服务。因而经不起资产阶级的捧场，被资产阶级思想所腐蚀、所俘掳。这就是江门市委所以离开了党、离开了工人阶级的立场，为资产阶级所俘掳并为资产阶级服务的根本原因。
