Xinhua News Agency, Twenty-fourth Dispatch: Tokyo Delayed News: The Japanese Communist Party's Provisional Central Guidance Department and the JCP Diet Members Group jointly issued a letter to the people of the whole country on January 22, calling on the Japanese people to rise up and overthrow the Yoshida government and immediately dissolve the Diet.

The statement said: Shigeru Yoshida has organized a cabinet based on the Liberal Party for three years, and its traitorous and anti-people nature has become increasingly obvious. The Japanese people now feel a deep sense of unease about the future of Japan.

The statement exposed the Yoshida government's recent anti-people policies, saying: First, for the benefit of a part of foreign countries, the Yoshida government is destroying the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation and the Japanese Constitution, and is preparing to strengthen the "Police Reserve Force" and the "Maritime Safety Agency," which is obviously a means of establishing a standing army and restoring war institutions. At the same time, the Yoshida government is taking a hostile attitude toward the governments and people of Japan's neighbors, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, plunging Japan into international disputes and war. Yoshida's letter to Dulles on December 24 last year was an act of challenging the People's Republic of China. Second, the draft budget for this year will use more than half of the budget for rearmament, and this draft is serving the American occupation and war policies. The lives of the Japanese people are already extremely impoverished, and the brutal implementation of this draft budget will cause heavy taxes and soaring prices, causing Japan's industry, agriculture, and commerce to be completely destroyed, and social life to be comprehensively damaged. Third, in order to make the various occupation regulations that deprive the Japanese people of their freedom into Japanese law, the Yoshida government is formulating laws such as the "Organizations Regulation Law" and the "General Strike Prohibition Law." These repressive bills are obviously an attempt to revive Japanese fascist militarism for the sake of war, and an attempt to severely oppress the freedom of the people.

The statement continued: The Japanese people's indignation is rising day by day against this series of war policies. The mood of distrust of the Yoshida cabinet and the demand for the establishment of a national liberation and democratic government is growing. Yoshida is increasingly isolated, and the contradictions within the Liberal Party are also deepening. The people's forces demanding the overthrow of the Yoshida cabinet, the establishment of a democratic government, and the abolition of the separate peace treaty and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," two traitorous treaties, are tending towards unity, and the organizations of workers and peasants are the center of this force.

The statement said: The Japanese people clearly recognize their enemies and clearly understand the road to liberation. Expelling the Yoshida traitorous government, immediately dissolving the Diet, and opposing the Yoshida government's various policies centered on the two traitorous treaties will surely be able to defend peace and establish a national liberation and democratic government.

The statement concluded: We firmly believe that the Japanese people have now taken a big step in this direction. We call on all patriotic political parties and organizations, trade unions, peasant organizations, and civic groups to jointly overthrow the Yoshida cabinet, immediately dissolve the Diet, abolish the two traitorous treaties, organize a national united front, and establish a national liberation and democratic government.

Xinhua News Agency, Twenty-fourth Dispatch: Tokyo News: On the 20th, under the auspices of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, representatives of about seventeen trade unions, a total of 5,000 people, held a conference in Kyoto to protest against the separate peace treaty, the US-Japan "Security Treaty," and the Yoshida government's plan to revise labor laws. After the meeting, the masses held a march and demonstration. The Yoshida government dispatched 3,500 police officers to attack the demonstrators. According to Agence France-Presse, the "conflict" lasted for two hours, and a number of people were killed and injured.

    组织国民战线打倒吉田卖国政府
    日本京都工会代表五千人集会示威抗议卖国条约
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党临时中央指导部和日共国会议员团在一月二十二日联合发表告全国人民书，号召日本人民起来打倒吉田政府，立即解散国会。
    文告说：吉田茂以自由党为基础组织内阁，迄今已有三年，它的卖国反人民的性质已经日益明显。日本国民现在对日本的前途感到深刻的不安。
    文告揭露吉田政府最近的反人民政策说：第一，吉田政府为了一部分外国的利益，破坏波茨坦公告的规定和日本宪法，准备加强“警察后备队”和“海上保安厅”，这显然是建立常备军和恢复战争机构的手段。同时，吉田政府对日本邻邦苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的政府和人民，采取敌对的态度，使日本陷于国际纠纷和战争的漩涡中。去年十二月二十四日吉田给杜勒斯的信，就是对中华人民共和国的挑战行为。第二，本年度的预算草案是要把预算的一大半用于重新武装，这个草案是为美国的占领和战争政策服务的。日本国民的生活已经贫困到极点，横蛮地实行这一预算草案，就会造成重税和物价飞涨，使日本的工业、农业、商业完全趋于毁灭，社会生活全面遭受破坏。第三，为了使剥夺日本人民的自由的各项占领法规成为日本的法律，吉田政府在制订“团体等规正法”、“禁止总罢工法”等法案。这些镇压性的法案显然是企图为了战争而复活日本法西斯军国主义，企图严重地压迫国民的自由。
    文告接着说：对这一连串的战争政策，日本国民的激愤情绪正在日益高昂。不信任吉田内阁、要求建立民族解放民主政府的情绪与日俱增。吉田日益孤立，自由党内部的矛盾也日益深刻了。要求打倒吉田内阁、建立民主政府、废弃单独和约和美日“安全条约”这两个卖国条约的人民势力正趋向于统一，而工人和农民的组织是这一势力的中心。
    文告说：日本国民明确认识了自己的敌人，明确了解了解放的道路。驱逐吉田卖国政府、立即解散国会和反对以两个卖国条约为中心的吉田政府的各种政策，这样就一定能够保卫和平，建立民族解放民主政府。
    文告最后说：我们深信日本国民现在已经向这个方向迈进了一大步。我们号召一切爱国的政党和团体、工会、农民团体和市民团体，共同起来打倒吉田内阁，立即解散国会，废除两个卖国条约，组织国民战线，建立民族解放民主政府。
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：二十日，在日本工会总评议会的主持下，约有十七个工会的代表共五千人在京都举行大会，抗议单独和约、美日“安全条约”和吉田政府修改劳工法规的计划。会后，群众举行游行示威。吉田政府出动了三千五百名警察攻击示威群众。据法新社讯，“冲突”历时达两小时之久，有若干人死伤。
