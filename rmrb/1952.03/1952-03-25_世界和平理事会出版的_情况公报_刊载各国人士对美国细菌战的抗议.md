    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 24th: The latest issue of the World Peace Council Secretariat's "Information Bulletin" published numerous protests against American bacteriological warfare. Below are some excerpts:

    World-renowned French mathematician Hadamard published an open letter to Professor Einstein in the French weekly "Action," in which he said: Some American scientists are participating in the preparation of bacteriological weapons; they can only arouse the contempt of scientists around the world for them.

    In a letter supporting Professor Joliot-Curie's statement, George Amado said: "With infinite anger, I join all those who raise their voices in protest against the barbaric behavior of the warmongers. I express the complete solidarity of the Brazilian people with the people of Korea and China."

    Mexican celebrity General Heriberto Jara wrote in a letter to the Secretary-General of the World Peace Council: "Guo Moruo's statement should be widely disseminated, because this statement can play a great role in making the world aware of the atrocities committed by those who call themselves defenders of civilization and Christianity. The brutality of the American war-makers is a great testimony, enough to awaken those who are indifferent and correct the views of those who think these beasts still have humanity."

    世界和平理事会出版的“情况公报”
    刊载各国人士对美国细菌战的抗议
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】世界和平理事会秘书处出版的最近一期“情况公报”上刊载了许多对美国进行细菌战的抗议，下面是几段摘引：
    世界闻名的法国数学家阿德马在法国“行动”周刊上发表一封给爱因斯坦教授的公开信，他在信中说：美国一些科学家参加了准备细菌武器的工作，他们只能引起全世界科学家们对他们的鄙视。
    乔治·亚马多在拥护约里奥—居里教授的声明的信中说：“我以无限愤怒的心情，与所有高扬起抗议呼声的人们一起抗议战争贩子的野兽行为。我代表巴西人民表示我们与朝鲜和中国的人民完全团结一致。”
    墨西哥名流艾里伯托·哈拉将军在给世界和平理事会秘书长的信中写道：“郭沫若的声明应该予以广泛传播，因为这个声明在使全世界认识那些自称为文明与基督教的保卫者的人所干下的兽行方面，可以起极大的作用。美国战争制造者的残暴是一个极大的证据，足以使那些漠不关心的人们猛醒过来，并纠正那些认为这些野兽还有人性的人们的看法。”
