    Depending on the masses to conduct trials of law-breaking industrial and commercial households
    The Central People's Government's State Council's regulations regarding the establishment of people's courts during the Five-Antis Campaign, for handling cases of serious and complete law-breaking by industrial and commercial households, and other cases that should be handled through trial procedures, is a powerful fighting weapon to guarantee the complete victory of the Five-Antis Campaign. This regulation will undoubtedly receive the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people.

    From beginning to end, the handling of cases of law-breaking by industrial and commercial households in various localities has relied on the strength of relevant organs, groups, and the broad masses of workers and shop assistants. These organs, groups, and workers and shop assistants have used great strength to investigate and grasp the facts and evidence of these industrial and commercial households' illegal activities, and in particular, the activists among the workers and shop assistants have engaged in resolute and heroic struggles face-to-face with the law-breaking industrial and commercial households. They are familiar with the history and current situation of these law-breaking industrial and commercial households, and they are also familiar with all the shameless tricks these law-breaking industrial and commercial households have used in the past and are currently using to conceal their crimes. Therefore, the establishment of people's courts for the "Five-Antis" campaign must have the participation of responsible persons from these organs and groups, and representatives of activists from among the workers and shop assistants. Relying on such people's courts to conduct trials will certainly be able to overcome various difficulties in the trial work, so that the trial work can proceed smoothly and quickly, and can guarantee the correctness of the handling. This is one of the important forms of the People's Government's implementation of the mass line. This is also an important creation in judicial work.

    Some people think that trial work can only be undertaken by professional legal workers, and that others cannot undertake this work; this is completely wrong. The law of the people's country is a weapon grasped by the broad masses of the people to punish various saboteurs; it is by no means something mysterious and unfathomable grasped only by a few people and divorced from the broad masses of the people. The broad masses of the people have a high degree of enthusiasm for protecting state property and safeguarding revolutionary law and discipline, and they have a clear and definite ability to distinguish between the interests of the country and the interests of the people, as has been demonstrated very clearly in the "Five-Antis" struggle. Moreover, in the "Five-Antis" struggle, they have conducted uncompromising struggles against the various illegal behaviors of industrial and commercial households, and have accumulated rich experience. They are fully capable of doing a good job in the trial work. Is there any doubt about this! It can be believed that their participation in the work of the people's courts will not only enable the trial work in this Five-Antis campaign to achieve great success, but also generally promote the necessary transformation of judicial work and legal workers. Those legal workers who only understand legal provisions but do not understand the actual situation should learn useful knowledge and experience from the people's courts.

    Of course, even with people's courts, not all problems can be solved. The People's Government must still be responsible for the cases heard by the people's courts. The State Council's regulations have already pointed out that the presiding judge, deputy presiding judge, and judges of the municipal people's court and its branches shall be appointed by the municipal people's government; the death penalty, life imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment of ten years or more sentenced by the municipal people's court must be approved by the municipal people's government. This means that the People's Government must carefully consider the candidates for the people's court and the cases it judges, and must not adopt a perfunctory, hasty, or irresponsible attitude. The spirit of these regulations is to require that in trial work, on the one hand, the mass line must be followed, and on the other hand, there must be effective leadership, and there must be no laissez-faire. In implementing this, all localities must grasp this spirit well, so that the people's courts can play their due role well, and avoid all possible mistakes.

### 依靠群众审判违法工商户

    依靠群众审判违法工商户
    中央人民政府政务院关于五反运动中成立人民法庭的规定，对于处理工商户中严重违法和完全违法的案件及其他应经审判程序处理的案件，保障五反运动完满的胜利，是一个有力的战斗武器。这个规定无疑地将获得广大人民的热烈拥护。
    各地对于工商户的违法案件，自始至终都是依靠有关的机关、团体和广大工人店员群众的力量来进行的。这些机关、团体和工人店员群众，曾经用了很大的力量来调查和掌握这些工商户违法的事实和证据，特别是广大工人店员的积极分子曾经和违法工商户面对面地进行过坚决的英勇的斗争。他们熟悉这些违法工商户的历史和现状，也熟悉这些违法工商户过去和现在掩饰罪行的一切无耻伎俩。因此，现在建立关于“五反”运动的人民法庭，就必须有这些机关、团体的负责人和工人、店员群众中的积极分子的代表参加。依靠这样的人民法庭来进行审判，就一定能够克服审判工作中的各种困难，使审判工作能够顺利地、迅速地进行，并且可以保证处理的正确。这是人民政府执行群众路线的重要形式之一。这在司法工作上也是一个重要的创造。
    有些人以为审判工作只能由专业的法律工作人员来担任，别的人就不能担任这种工作，这是完全错误的。人民国家的法律，是由广大人民掌握、用以制裁各种破坏分子的武器，决不是只由少数人掌握、脱离广大人民的什么神秘的莫测高深的东西。广大人民群众有爱护国家财产和维护革命法纪的高度热情，他们对于国家的利害和人民的利害有清醒而明确的分辨能力，这在“五反”斗争中已经表现得十分明白了。何况在“五反”斗争中，他们对于工商户的各种违法行为进行了不妥协的战斗，又积累了丰富经验，他们完全能够把审判工作做得好，这难道还有什么疑问吗！可以相信，由他们来参加人民法庭的工作，不但可以使这次五反运动中的审判工作获得极大的成功，而且一般地也可以促使司法工作和法律工作者获得必要的改造。那些只懂得法律条文而不了解实际情况的法律工作者应当从人民法庭学到有益的知识和经验。
    当然，有了人民法庭，也还不是一切问题都可以解决的，人民政府仍然要对人民法庭所审理的案件负责。政务院的规定中已经指明，市人民法庭及其分庭的审判长、副审判长、审判员，均由市人民政府任命；市人民法庭所判决的死刑、无期徒刑及十年以上的有期徒刑，并须由市人民政府批准。这就是说，人民政府对人民法庭的人选和它所判决的案件，都必须审慎考虑，不能采取敷衍草率、不负责任的态度。这些规定的精神，就是要求在审判工作中一方面要走群众路线，一方面还要有切实的领导，不能放任自流。各地在执行中，必须很好地掌握这种精神，使人民法庭能很好地起它应有的作用，而避免一切可能发生的错误。
