    Yishun Leather Shop's Profiteers Secretly Harm the Volunteer Army

    To the Editors: The capitalists of Yishun, Xingsheng, Sanheyuan, and other leather shops in Beijing have consistently cruelly exploited and oppressed workers. Yishun Leather Shop, in particular, has cut corners and secretly harmed the Volunteer Army. This firm’s profiteers are frenzied, and last year, when undertaking a batch of items for the Volunteer Army, they cut corners to obtain exorbitant profits. The iron rings used on carts were originally supposed to be new, but the profiteers went to the market to buy old ones to replace them. The leather used for the small saddles was of inferior quality, but the profiteers passed it off as good. The ropes used for the carts were not up to standard, and even the whips used to drive the carts were made of shoddy goods by the profiteers. Most of the other parts had problems. We demand that the government severely punish these profiteers who secretly harm the Volunteer Army.

    义顺皮子铺奸商暗害志愿军
    编辑同志：北京义顺、兴盛、三合元等皮子铺资方，一贯残酷剥削和压迫工人。义顺皮子铺更偷工减料，暗害志愿军。该号奸商丧心病狂，在去年承做的一批志愿军用的物件上偷工减料，获取暴利。大车上用的铁环原来说好要用新的，奸商却到小市上去买旧的来顶替。小鞍子上用的皮子，奸商用次的冒充好的。车用绳子都不够份量，甚至连赶车用的鞭子，奸商也用了坏货。其他各项零件多半有问题。我们要求政府严惩这些暗害志愿军的奸商。
