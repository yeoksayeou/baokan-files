Why the Innovation Record Movement of Pingxiang Coal Miners Last Winter Was Not Consolidated
Zhang Taoguang

From the end of October to December 28th last year, the state-owned Pingxiang Coal Mine experienced a vigorous innovation record movement. At that time, the democratic reform of Pingxiang Coal Mine entered the stage of democratic unity; due to the overthrow of the foremen in the democratic reform, the workers' awareness and production enthusiasm were greatly improved, and they consciously used their brains to study technology and create new records. However, the leading cadres of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau and relevant higher-level leading cadres did not have enough understanding of the masses' awareness and creativity, and failed to organize the masses' innovation record movement in a planned manner, so that many extremely valuable new records could not be maintained and promoted in a timely manner.

From the end of October to December last year, the workers of Pingxiang Coal Mine created 166 new records. Among them, hand-picked coal mining and rock roadway excavation created the highest national records. Guo Qingsi, a hand-picked coal miner, mined 79 tons of coal per shift, which was six times higher than the general efficiency of Pingxiang Coal Mine at that time, exceeding the efficiency prescribed by the Ministry of Fuel Industry by 60%, setting an example for improving production efficiency under backward conditions. The Shimen Iron and Steel Team of the Wangjiayuan Mine of Pingxiang Coal Mine created the highest national record of 20.3 meters of rock roadway excavation efficiency, exceeding the original highest national record by more than 20%. Before October, the excavation efficiency of Pingxiang Coal Mine was only 4 meters. Liu Songqiao and He Jincheng, workers in charge of roof caving and material extraction, improved the method of roof caving and material extraction, so that the recovery rate of pit wood reached 50% under the condition of local roof caving, which was more than four times higher than in the past, reducing the total cost of each ton of coal by 8%. In addition, the efficiency of pneumatic picks, coal washing, pushing carts, pillars, and filling has increased several times compared with the past. The innovation record movement of Pingxiang Coal Mine workers was not planned and organized by the leadership, but the result of the workers' improved awareness in the democratic reform movement and their spontaneous demand to improve production. Just as the first pneumatic pick operator who created a new record said: "In the past, when the foremen were in power, people's hearts were scattered. When working and eating, no one wanted to produce more. Now I feel happy, and my hands are strong. When I say something, everyone will do it." When the news of the new record in Longhu Mine spread to Wangjiayuan Mine, the workers immediately boiled over, and everyone clamored: "We just want to improve production, but we can't find the way." On the same day, seven workers ran seven or eight miles to Longhu Mine to learn from experience during their rest time. This innovation record movement of Pingxiang Coal Mine workers has two very prominent characteristics: First, they strive to study technology and improve tools. In the innovation record movement, the workers automatically established a "pit technology research association" system, studying the various conditions of the working face on that day before going to work, and discussing how to carry out the work; summarizing the experiences and lessons in production on that day after work. Feng Jiali, a pneumatic pick operator at Wangjiayuan Mine, started to improve the pneumatic pick drill bit in order to improve production efficiency. At that time, someone said: "You have to pay if you break it." He said: "In order to improve production, I have to try even if I break it and have to pay." After he successfully improved the pneumatic pick drill bit, he mined more than 30 tons of coal per shift in a thin coal seam of less than 1.5 meters, and the efficiency was twice as high as in the past. Another feature of the new record movement is that the workers consciously united and helped each other, automatically improved labor organization, and various types of work closely cooperated. The sectarian disputes that existed among workers in the past, such as mutual disregard, disunity between outside and inside workers, and mutual conservatism of technology between southern and northern workers, have been basically resolved in the democratic reform. In the innovation record movement, all supporting departments put forward their guarantees. The cart pusher and hooker guaranteed how much coal would be produced; the electromechanical worker guaranteed that the electric chute would not stop for a minute; the group leaders were responsible for ensuring environmental safety; the previous shift prepared the working face and tools for the next shift. When the Shimen Iron and Steel Team created a new record in excavation, the electromechanical department guaranteed to provide them with sufficient wind power (more than twice the usual wind power). The prospects for the innovation record movement carried out on such a good basis were extremely broad; if the leaders of Pingxiang Coal Mine could scientifically summarize these valuable creations of the workers and promote them in an organized and planned manner, it would be an important guarantee for completing the increase production and save economy plan.

However, the innovation record movement of Pingxiang Coal Mine workers quickly collapsed. Why did the new record movement of Pingxiang Coal Mine collapse? The basic reason is that the bureau, mine, and relevant leading cadres underestimated the workers' awareness and creativity, and even did not believe in the awareness and strength of the masses, so they could not stand in front of the masses and lead the masses to improve production in a planned manner. Cao Zhizhen of the Central South Democratic Reform Inspection Team (Minister of Production of the Central South Federation of Trade Unions) said when talking about the new record movement of Pingxiang Coal Mine: "The new record has not been maintained. Is it because it was raised too high and too far away from the level of the general masses?" Feng Guanzhi of the Central South Democratic Reform Inspection Team (Minister of the Youth Workers Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the Central South Bureau) also believed: "The new record movement appeared too early, and the workers' ideological awareness was not enough; if it appeared after the completion of the democratic reform, it would be consolidated." In fact, many workers were already spontaneously learning from the experience of advanced producers there. In the face of the great creation of the working class, the leading cadres of the bureau and the mine were not happy and encouraged, but first considered that the innovation record movement should not "overwhelm" democratic unity. They did not regret the failure to maintain the new record, but instead believed that it was "inevitable" that the new record could not be maintained by concentrating on democratic unity. In fact, it was not the workers but the leading cadres who opposed democratic reform and the innovation record movement. At that time, the democratic unity of Pingxiang Coal Mine was indeed in a paralyzed state, and the workers were indeed slackening their efforts on democratic unity. But this was not because the workers carried out the innovation record movement, but mainly because the leading cadres who led democratic unity did not accept the workers' opinions well, and the movement lasted too long. Therefore, the essence of the problem is that the leading cadres do not believe in the awareness of the masses and lack enthusiasm for the great creation of the masses.

Since the leading cadres of Pingxiang Coal Mine did not attach importance to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, they could not solve the problems in the ideology of cadres and business management exposed in the new record movement in a timely manner. At that time, some cadres and technicians had many incorrect views on the new record. Some people were out of touch with reality and treated the creation of the masses with an irresponsible attitude. Guo Qingsi's new record of hand-picked coal mining and Liu Songqiao and He Jincheng's method of roof caving and material extraction were not valued. Even some administrative leading cadres did not pay attention to these things at all. They believed: "These are new records under backward conditions. In the future, everything will be mechanized, so it is useless." They did not take into account that Pingxiang Coal Mine could not be completely mechanized in one or two years, and that promoting the experience of Guo Qingsi and Liu Songqiao could greatly reduce costs and create more wealth for the country under the existing equipment conditions; this would also enable mechanization to be realized sooner. Some cadres only believed in the advanced experience of other places and could not humbly accept the advanced experience of their own mines. When the new record of rock roadway excavation in Wangjiayuan Mine appeared, Gaokeng Mine was learning the excavation experience of Hongshan Coal Mine in Shandong. The chairman of the trade union of this mine did not believe in the experience of Wangjiayuan, and even openly said to the workers: "Don't believe it, they are bragging." Some people even stood aside with a very bad attitude and pointed fingers at the great creation of the masses, criticizing, making things difficult, and even deliberately slandering them. Some people said that the workers created new records with "impure motives," "wanting glory, wanting to be labor models," and "wanting to get more wages"; some people said that those new records that appeared because of the improvement of labor organization were made with "the help of others"; some people deliberately picked faults, saying that the "method is not safe" for workers to create new records, and so on. These harmful ideas also hindered the development of the movement to a greater or lesser extent.

When the workers created new records and labor productivity increased, some production equipment could not keep up with the needs. The leadership did not solve these problems in a timely manner, which directly affected the development of the innovation record movement. For example, Wangjiayuan Mine could produce more than 600 tons of raw coal a day in the new record movement. However, the coal washing capacity was only more than 400 tons, and the transportation capacity was only more than 200 tons, resulting in the accumulation of more than 30,000 tons of raw coal, which was piled up at the wellhead like a small mountain. Raw coal will spontaneously ignite if it is left on the ground for a long time, which the workers call "burning pile." Wangjiayuan Mine had several "burning pile" phenomena. The workers asked the mine director to solve the problem in order to continue to improve efficiency. The mine director's reply was: "Forget it, it's even worse to dig it out and let it burn." In fact, these problems can be solved. Wangjiayuan Mine uses manual coal washing; the problem can be solved by appropriately adjusting the labor organization. According to the original design capacity, the transportation equipment of Wangjiayuan Mine can transport 600 tons; if the utilization rate of the equipment is improved, the transportation will not catch up with the mining. Similarly, the lifting capacity of Longhu Mine is small, and the leadership did not seize the opportunity to solve it.

With the emergence of new records, there began to be a surplus of labor, which needed to be adjusted. When Pingxiang Coal Mine transferred these workers, they did not give them sufficient explanations and mobilization, and the handling of wages was not appropriate, which resulted in great dissatisfaction among the transferred workers. The leadership's handling of the award issues in the new record movement was not serious enough. In the new record movement, it was correct for Pingxiang Coal Mine to conduct awards in a timely manner and mobilize workers to evaluate merit. However, they did not deal with the opinions of each group carefully enough, and even missed the opinions of many groups, so that some new record creators did not win awards, which affected the workers' emotions.

There are also some objective reasons for the failure to maintain the new record of Pingxiang Coal Mine, such as the poor working face for coal mining at that time, with many rock inclusions, and the need to explore water in the rock roadway due to many old tunnels; however, these reasons are secondary.

Now, the leadership of Pingxiang Coal Mine has begun to pay attention to solving the various problems exposed in the new record movement, and has summarized the experience of the three new records of hand-picked coal mining, rock roadway excavation, and roof caving and material extraction, while continuing to train these advanced producers. The trade union has also begun to organize key groups in each mine to learn from these advanced experiences, preparing conditions for popularization in each mine in the future. Recently, Zhu Xuechu, an underground staff member of Wangjiayuan Mine, has improved the filling method, which has greatly improved the recovery rate of pit wood and created the highest national record for the recovery rate of pit wood for manual roof caving and material extraction; this has advanced the roof caving and material extraction method of Liu Songqiao and He Jincheng, workers of Longhu Mine, by a big step. Feng Jiali and other workers of Wangjiayuan Mine learned Guo Qingsi's method of hand-picked coal mining, and on February 5th, they created a new national record for hand-picked coal mining in medium-hard coal seams. The leadership of Pingxiang Coal Mine should accept the lessons of last winter, pay enough attention to the new creations of workers and staff in production, and summarize and promote them well, so that the new records can be maintained, popularized, and continuously advanced.

    萍乡煤矿工人去年冬天的创新纪录运动为什么没有巩固下来
    张涛光
    去年十月底到十二月二十八日，国营萍乡煤矿曾经出现过一个轰轰烈烈的创新纪录运动。那时候萍乡煤矿的民主改革进入了民主团结阶段；由于在民主改革中斗倒了把头，工人们的觉悟程度和生产积极性大大提高，自觉地开动脑筋钻研技术，创造新纪录。但是，萍乡矿务局的领导干部以及有关的上级领导干部却对群众的觉悟程度和创造性认识不足，未能有计划地组织群众的创新纪录运动，因而使许多极可宝贵的新纪录不能保持下来并及时推广。
    去年十月末到十二月，萍乡煤矿的工人们曾先后创造了一百六十六件新纪录。其中手镐采煤和石巷掘进两项创造了全国最高纪录。手镐采煤工人郭清四，一班挖煤七十九吨，较萍乡煤矿当时的一般效率提高了六倍，超过了中央燃料工业部所规定的效率的百分之六十，为在落后条件下提高生产效率作出了榜样。萍乡煤矿王家源矿场的石门钢铁队，创造了石门掘进效率二十点三公尺的全国最高纪录，超过原来全国最高纪录的百分之二十以上。而萍乡煤矿在十月份以前的掘进效率仅四公尺。放顶抽料工刘松桥、何金城改进了放顶抽料工作法，在局部放顶的条件下，使坑木回收率达到百分之五十，较过去提高四倍以上，使每吨煤的总成本降低百分之八。此外，风镐，洗煤、推车、支柱、充填各工种的效率都比过去提高数倍。萍乡煤矿工人的创造新纪录运动并不是领导方面有计划地组织的，而是工人们在民主改革运动中觉悟提高了，自发地要求搞好生产的结果。正像第一个创造新纪录的风镐手说的：“过去把头当权，人心是散的，干活吃饭，谁也不想多生产。现在心里痛快，手上就带劲儿，说一声大家就干起来了。”当龙虎矿出现了新纪录的消息传到王家源矿的时候，工人们马上沸腾起来，大家吵嚷着：“光想提高生产，就是找不着门道。”当天就有七个工人在休息时间跑七八里路到龙虎矿去学习经验。萍乡煤矿工人这次创新纪录运动有两个很突出的特点：一是努力钻研技术，改进工具。在创新纪录运动中，工人们自动建立了“坑上技术研究会”的制度，上班前研究当天工作面的各种条件，讨论应该如何进行工作；下班时总结当天生产中的经验教训。王家源矿场风镐手冯家礼为了提高生产效率，着手改进风镐钎子。当时有人说：“改坏了你可得赔。”他说：“为了搞好生产，就是改坏了让我赔，我也得试试。”他改进风镐钎子成功后，在一公尺半以下的薄煤层中，一班挖煤三十多吨，效率较过去提高一倍。新纪录运动的另一特点，是工人们自觉地团结互助，自动地改善劳动组织，各种工种密切配合。过去工人之间存在的互不理睬，外工、里工不团结，南方工人和北方工人互相保守技术等宗派纠纷，在民主改革中都已基本上得到解决。在创新纪录运动中，各配合部门都提出了自己的保证。推车挂钩工保证有多少煤出多少煤；机电工保证电溜子一分钟不停；大小组长负责保证环境安全；前班为后班准备工作面，预备工具。石门钢铁队创造掘进新纪录时，机电部门就曾保证供给他们以足够的风力（超过平时风力的两倍以上）。在这样良好的基础上开展起来的创造新纪录运动，它的前途本来是极其广阔的；如果萍乡煤矿的领导方面能够把工人们的这些宝贵的创造加以科学的总结，并有组织有计划地进行推广，对于完成增产节约计划将是一个重要的保证。
    但是，萍乡煤矿工人们的创新纪录运动很快地垮下来了。萍乡煤矿的新纪录运动为什么会垮下来呢？基本原因在于：局、矿以及有关的领导干部对群众的觉悟程度和创造性估计不足，甚至不相信群众的觉悟和力量，因而不能站在群众的前面有计划地领导群众提高生产。中南民主改革检查组曹志真
    （中南总工会生产部长）在谈及萍乡煤矿的新纪录运动时曾说：“新纪录没有保持，是不是因为提得太高，距离一般群众水平太远的缘故？”中南民主改革检查组封贯之（中共中央中南局青委青工部部长）也认为：“新纪录运动出现得太早了，工人思想觉悟不够；如果在民主改革完成以后出现，就会巩固下来。”实际上，许多工人已在那里自发地向先进生产者学习经验了。局和矿的领导干部在工人阶级的伟大的创造面前，不是欢欣鼓舞，而是首先考虑到创新纪录运动不该“压倒”了民主团结。他们对于新纪录的没有保持并不惋惜，反而认为集中力量进行民主团结，新纪录不能保持是“必然的”。实际上把民主改革和创新纪录运动对立起来的并不是工人而是领导干部。当时萍乡煤矿的民主团结确是处于瘫痪状态，工人也确实对民主团结松了劲。但这并不是因为工人们开展了创新纪录运动，而主要是因为领导民主团结的领导干部没有很好地接受工人的意见，同时运动的时间又拖得太长。所以，问题的实质还是领导干部不相信群众的觉悟，对群众的伟大的创造缺乏热情。
    萍乡煤矿的领导干部既然不重视工人群众的热情和创造，对于在新纪录运动中暴露出来的干部思想和经营管理上的问题就不能及时地予以解决。当时，在部分干部和技术人员中，对新纪录有许多不正确的看法。有些人脱离现实，以不负责任的态度对待群众的创造。郭清四的手镐采煤新纪录和刘松桥、何金城的放顶抽料法出现后，都没有受到重视。甚至有些行政领导干部对这些事情根本不加理睬。他们认为：“这些是落后条件下的新纪录，将来都要机械化，就没有什么用处了。”他们完全没有考虑到萍乡煤矿在一两年内仍不可能完全机械化，而推广郭清四和刘松桥等的经验，在现有的设备条件下就可以大大降低成本，为国家更多地创造财富；这样也才能更早地实现机械化。还有些干部只相信外地的先进经验而不能虚心地接受自己矿场上的先进经验。王家源石门掘进的新纪录出现时，高坑矿场正在学习山东洪山煤矿的掘进经验，这个矿的工会主席却不相信王家源的经验，甚至公开地对工人说：“不要信，他们吹牛皮。”有些人甚至以十分恶劣的态度，站在一旁对群众的伟大的创造指手划脚地加以指责、非难以至有意中伤。有人说工人创造新纪录是“动机不纯”、“想光荣、想当劳动模范”、“想多拿工资”；有人说那些因为改善劳动组织而出现的新纪录是“有旁人帮忙”才做出来的；有些人故意挑毛病，说工人创造新纪录的“方法不安全”等等。这些有害的思想也都或多或少地阻碍了运动的发展。
    工人创造了新纪录，劳动生产率提高了，有些生产设备赶不上需要。领导方面没有及时解决这些问题，直接地影响了创新纪录运动的发展。比如，王家源矿场在新纪录运动中，一天能出六百多吨毛煤。但是洗煤能力只有四百多吨，运搬能力只有二百多吨，以致积压毛煤三万多吨，在井口上堆得像小山一样。毛煤在地面上放久了就要自燃，工人们叫做“烧堆”。王家源矿便发生过几次“烧堆”现象。工人们要求矿长解决问题，以便继续提高效率。矿长的回答却是：“算了吧，挖出来让它烧了，更不好。”实际上，这些问题是可以解决的。王家源矿洗煤是用人工；适当地调整劳动组织，问题就可以解决。王家源矿的运搬设备按原设计能力可运六百吨；如果提高设备利用率，就不致使运搬赶不上回采。同样，龙虎矿的提升能力较小，领导方面也没有抓紧解决。
    随着新纪录的出现，劳动力开始有了剩余，需要进行调整。萍乡煤矿在调动这些工人时，没有向他们进行充分解释动员，对工资的处理也不恰当，结果引起被调工人的很大不满。新纪录运动中的奖励问题，领导方面处理得也不够认真。在新纪录运动中，萍乡煤矿及时进行奖励并发动工人评功，这是正确的。但是他们对各小组的意见处理得不够慎重，甚至遗漏了不少小组的意见，使得有些新纪录创造者没有得奖，结果影响了工人的情绪。
    萍乡煤矿的新纪录没有保持，也还有一些客观原因，如当时采煤工作面不好，夹石多，石门掘进因老窿多要探水等；不过，这些原因都是次要的。
    现在，萍乡煤矿的领导方面已开始注意解决新纪录运动中暴露出来的各种问题，并且总结了手镐采煤、石门掘进、放顶抽料三项新纪录的经验，同时继续培养这些先进生产者。工会也开始组织各矿的重点小组学习这些先进经验，为今后在各矿普遍推广准备条件。最近，王家源矿场井下职员朱学初又改进了充填方法，使坑木回收率又大大提高，创造了人工放顶抽料坑木回收率的全国最高纪录；把龙虎矿场工人刘松桥、何金城的放顶抽料方法又推进了一大步。王家源矿场工人冯家礼等学习郭清四手镐采煤方法，二月五日又创造了中硬煤层手镐采煤全国新纪录。萍乡煤矿领导方面应当接受去冬的教训，足够地重视工人职员们在生产上的新创造，好好总结，好好推广，使新纪录能够保持、普及并不断前进。
