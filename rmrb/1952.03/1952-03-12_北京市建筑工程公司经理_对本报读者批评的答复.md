Column: Reactions to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

To the Editors:

The People's Daily published letters from readers Chen He and others on January 23rd and 30th, criticizing our company for not doing a good job in the anti-corruption movement. This criticism is correct. After the anti-corruption movement began in our company, I thought that "materials are supplied by the company, workers are assigned by the company, and there shouldn't be major problems with the personnel on the construction sites." I wanted the construction department to squeeze out seven days to resolve the salary adjustment and bonus issues for technical personnel, thereby relaxing leadership over the construction department and delaying the progress of the department's movement. My understanding of the corruption problems among technical personnel was also inadequate. Without investigation and analysis, I assumed that the technical personnel didn't have significant problems, and I mistakenly approved Shen Hongtao, who hadn't completely confessed his problems, to go home for the Spring Festival. These all demonstrate that my right-leaning thinking is very serious. In fact, in the forty-plus days of struggle, the construction department discovered significant corruption and theft problems. This proves that my previous understanding was completely wrong. In addition to making a self-criticism here, I am determined to thoroughly carry out the anti-corruption movement in the construction department and other departments of the company, and I will not stop until a complete victory is achieved. I thank the readers who criticized us.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　崔映国, Manager of Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Company

Editor's Note: From the repeated letters from readers of this newspaper, it is clear that Beijing Construction Company has many problems. The above three self-criticisms are not profound enough. We believe that Beijing Construction Company should systematically examine its right-leaning tendencies.

### 北京市建筑工程公司经理  对本报读者批评的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    北京市建筑工程公司经理
    对本报读者批评的答复
    编辑同志：人民日报在一月二十三日、三十日刊载了读者陈和等的来信，批评我公司没有搞好反贪污运动，这是对的。我公司反贪污运动开始以后，我认为“材料由公司供应，工人由公司调配，工地人员问题不大”，要施工部挤出七天时间解决技术人员的调薪给奖问题，因而放松了对施工部的领导，拖延了该部运动的进程。我对技术人员的贪污问题也是认识不足的。我没有经过调查分析，就以为技术人员无多大问题，在春节时并错误地批准了没有彻底交代问题的沈洪涛回家过节。这些都说明了我的右倾思想很严重。事实上在四十多天的斗争中，施工部查出有很大的贪污、盗窃问题。这证明我以前的认识是十分错误的。我现在除了对此作检讨外，并要下决心彻底搞好施工部和公司其他部门的反贪污运动，不获全胜，决不收兵。我向批评我们的读者致谢。　北京市建筑工程公司经理崔映国
    编者按：从本报读者屡次来信中看，北京建筑公司的问题很多。以上三个检讨都不深刻。我们认为北京建筑公司应系统地检查右倾思想。
