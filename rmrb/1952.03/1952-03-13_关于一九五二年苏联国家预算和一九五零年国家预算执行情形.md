——Full Text of the Report by Soviet Minister of Finance Zverev at the Joint Session of the Union Council and the National Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on March 6 Regarding the 1952 Soviet National Budget and the Implementation of the 1950 National Budget

Responsible personnel of government ministries, enterprises, and economic organs must make more resolute efforts to be more economical, which is extremely important for further economic development. To this end, it is necessary to constantly consolidate cost accounting as the basic method of socialist management, adopt more extensive methods of saving in production, and more effectively utilize the materials and money allocated by the state to enterprises.

In this regard, financial and credit institutions also play an important role. However, some staff members of financial and credit institutions have still not been able to ensure effective control over the economic and financial activities of enterprises and organs, and their research into the economic and financial situation of enterprises and economic organs is insufficient.

The finance ministries of the Kirghiz and Karelo-Finnish republics were found to have serious shortcomings in their work last year. They did not thoroughly examine the budgets and reports submitted by some enterprises and organs, and they were not strict and rigorous enough in strengthening financial discipline and using state funds frugally.

The Soviet Ministry of Finance, together with financial organs and the State Bank and its institutions, must daily strengthen financial control over the production and circulation of goods. Financial organs and credit institutions must closely supervise the fulfillment of the tasks of reducing production costs and circulation expenses, the expenditure of salary funds, and the timely and complete remittance of funds due to the budget by enterprises and economic organizations.

As pointed out above, the majority of budget revenue comes from the socialist economy. The 1952 Soviet National Budget stipulates that residents pay taxes of 47.4 billion rubles, accounting for 9.3 percent of total revenue.

In the past year, financial organs have had serious shortcomings in collecting taxes from residents in some union republics and states. The agricultural tax collection plans in the Krasnodar Territory, Orel, Bryansk, and some other states of the Russian Federation, as well as the Grodno and Minsk states of the Belarusian Republic, were not completed in a timely manner.

The financial organs of various republics and states should improve their rural tax collection activities, and the councils of ministers and executive committees of the labor people's representative soviets of various republics should provide the necessary assistance to the financial organs in this regard.

The people's voluntary contributions—public bonds and savings bank deposits—are very important.

The actual subscription amount of the Soviet National Economic Development Bonds issued in 1951 exceeded the original amount by 4.8 billion rubles. Last year, the purchase of public bonds by collective farmers with steadily increasing incomes greatly increased.

This year, the revenue from promoting and selling public bonds to the people and state organs is stipulated to be 42.5 billion rubles. Public bond funds will be used for the construction of great communist construction projects and for measures to ensure the further improvement of the material and cultural standards of our people.

The continuous improvement of the people's material welfare has also increased the work of savings banks in attracting deposits.

In 1951, deposits in savings banks increased by 4 billion rubles, and the number of depositors increased by more than 3 million. The plan for 1952 requires an increase of 4.5 billion rubles in savings bank deposits. The state insurance industry has further developed last year, and a considerable amount of funds will be used in this area this year. Collective farm crop and livestock insurance has increased, as has individual voluntary insurance.

However, the state insurance industry needs to be significantly improved, especially in the area of voluntary insurance. Financial organs, especially insurance workers, must expand the scope of voluntary insurance and increase the collection of insurance premiums.

Expenditures of the 1952 Soviet National Budget

Comrade Representatives! The productive forces of our socialist country are developing forward at an unprecedented speed.

The great communist construction plans being implemented on the initiative of Comrade Stalin are of particular importance for the further development of our country's productive forces and for the increase of social wealth and living welfare. The Volga-Don waterway project—the first of the great plans—will begin to be used this year.

The construction of the world's largest hydroelectric project, as well as the further development of industry, agriculture, transportation, housing construction, science, education, and healthcare, requires a large amount of budgetary expenditure.

The total expenditure of the 1952 Soviet National Budget is stipulated to be 476.9 billion rubles, of which 180.4 billion rubles will be used to develop the national economy, 124.8 billion rubles will be used for social and cultural facilities, 113.8 billion rubles will be used for defense, 14.4 billion rubles will be used for the expenses of state administrative organs, and 8.9 billion rubles will be used to pay bonuses to the people and interest on public bonds.

The 1952 budget expenditure will be 35.6 billion rubles or 8.1 percent more than the 1951 budget expenditure.

Looking at the above figures, it is clear that the largest part of the national budget funds is used for the national economy and cultural undertakings.

Financial Management of the National Economy

This year, more than half of the funds stipulated in the budget for the national economy will be used for capital construction.

The funds allocated for investment and increasing the working capital of construction work in 1952 are set at 143.1 billion rubles, of which 98.1 billion rubles come from the budget and 45 billion rubles come from the funds of enterprises and economic organs.

Compared with 1951 and 1950, construction agencies have reduced construction costs and shortened construction time.

However, some institutions under the Ministry of Construction of Heavy Industry Enterprises, the Ministry of Heavy Machinery Manufacturing, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Power Stations, and the Ministry of Machinery and Instruments Manufacturing have failed to ensure that the targets set by the state plan for reducing construction costs are met, because there are serious shortcomings in the organization of construction work and the utilization of a large number of construction machines owned by the construction industry.

Machines are not fully utilized in construction projects, and there are still many cases of construction machines being left idle.

In the institutions of the "Dzerzhinsky Construction Engineering Management Office" and "Makayevka Construction Engineering Management Office" under the Fifth Trust of the Ministry of Construction of Heavy Industry Enterprises, excavators, loaders, and cranes are often left idle due to inappropriate organization of the entire work front and accidental repairs and damage. In 1951, at the construction site of the Kama Hydroelectric Power Station, cranes and tractor-towed scrapers were idle for more than one-third of the working time. In many construction sites, the organization of automobile transportation work is inappropriate, leaving automobiles idle or running empty.

Some institutions use construction materials beyond the quota, overspend on wages, and pay excessive miscellaneous expenses.

In the first nine months of 1951, the Second Department of the Fifth Trust under the Ministry of Construction of Heavy Industry Enterprises used materials exceeding the estimated quantity as follows: sawn timber exceeded the estimated quantity by 23 percent, iron roofing materials exceeded the estimated quantity by 32 percent, and lime exceeded the estimated quantity by 53 percent.

In the ten months of 1951, the Nazarov Construction and Installation Management Office of the Krasnoyarsk Mining Construction Management Office under the Ministry of Coal Industry overspent on wages by nearly one million rubles, and the cost of construction materials used exceeded the original plan by 200,500 rubles.

The construction project of the Bashyesk Cement Factory, carried out by the trust of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry of the Soviet Union, paid more than double the estimated miscellaneous expenses in the nine months of 1951.

The leaders of government departments should supervise the fulfillment of the task of reducing construction costs, strictly abide by the completion deadlines stipulated by the government for projects under construction, make better use of construction machines, not allow raw material expenditures to exceed the prescribed estimates, and reduce miscellaneous expenses.

The Long-Term Investment Bank must systematically supervise the fulfillment of the task of reducing construction costs, but it cannot often complete this important task. For example, the industrial bank offices in Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Lison, and Vinnitsa have not established the necessary supervision over the use of materials and wages, have not fully checked the blueprints and estimates of construction projects, and have not made the necessary struggle to strengthen the financial discipline and accounting discipline of construction projects.

Various long-term investment banks should improve their work and exercise strict financial supervision over the progress of construction.

In 1952, the working capital of enterprises and economic organs will be 10.7 billion rubles more than in 1951. The increase in working capital is determined to adapt to the increase in production and trade volume and taking into account the task of reducing production costs. In addition, in 1952, the turnover rate of funds in the national economy must be further accelerated.

4.6 billion rubles allocated by the state budget and 6.1 billion rubles provided by the profits of the national economy and other domestic economic sources will be used to increase the working capital of this year. In raising funds to increase the working capital of various enterprises themselves, the proportion provided by the resources of the enterprises themselves will increase to 57.2 percent, while it was 52.6 percent in 1951. This places a great responsibility on the leaders of enterprises and economic institutions for fulfilling the tasks of reducing production costs, obtaining profits, and accelerating the turnover rate of commodities and materials.

In recent years, the use of working capital in the national economy has improved. The turnover rate of commodities and materials allocated to enterprises under various central industrial departments was 4 percent faster in the first nine months of 1951 than in the same period in 1950.

However, there are still major shortcomings in the use of working capital in enterprises under some departments; the work of searching for and utilizing surplus and unnecessary raw materials has not been well organized; and the quantity of stored raw materials, materials, fuel, and finished products also exceeds the plan.

The over-planned accumulation of commodities and materials is often related to the imbalance of production and the serious shortcomings of some government departments in organizing the supply of raw materials and equipment.

For example, in the Mytishchi Machine Manufacturing Factory under the Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry, the average monthly production in the first ten days of the month in 1951 was 18 percent, the middle ten days was 27.1 percent, and the last ten days was 54.9 percent. This unbalanced situation in the factory's work leaves workers idle for a lot of time, reduces the utilization rate of equipment, and creates a large surplus of commodities and materials exceeding the estimate; these surpluses were worth more than 11 million rubles on January 1, 1952.

The central administrations and supply agencies of various government departments often allocate funds improperly when allocating them to various enterprises, and they also lack flexibility in supplying raw materials to various enterprises.

For example, the Viksa Factory under the Ministry of Construction and Road-Building Machinery Manufacturing only needed 2,827 tons of alloy steel plates in the first nine months of 1951, but the actual allocation to the factory was 4,048 tons. The allocation of materials to help production, such as iron bars, conveyor belts, engines, and diesel engines, also exceeded the actual needs by a lot.

Once, the Central Administration ordered the allocation of fuel to the Krasnoyarsk Factory under the Ministry of Heavy Machinery Manufacturing, but it did not take into account the original accumulated fuel. As a result, the factory's coal reserves greatly exceeded the original quota, resulting in a large loss of coal and increasing many non-productive expenses.

The heads of various departments and enterprises must pay more attention to the planning and use of working capital, pay more attention to the organization of material and equipment supply, not allow too much goods and materials to be stockpiled, and should deal with these materials in a timely manner in accordance with the orders of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

All this is a necessary condition for further improving the economic and financial activities of enterprises and institutions.

The various levels of financial organs and state banks must constantly supervise the situation of various enterprises and institutions, supervise the use of their working capital and bank loans.

However, it should be pointed out that some financial and credit organs have not fully fulfilled their responsibilities and have not fully supervised the use of working capital of various enterprises and institutions. The worst work in this regard is done by the state bank branches in Tajikistan and Penza, which have not carried out the necessary struggle to eliminate the phenomenon of enterprises and trade institutions stockpiling goods and materials exceeding the estimate, nor have they ordered them to carry out economic accounting and abide by financial discipline in a timely manner.

The staff of financial and credit organs must eliminate the current shortcomings and greatly improve their work.

The state budget stipulates that the expenditure for agriculture and forestry in 1952 is 34.7 billion rubles, and this figure was decided taking into account the reduction in the prices of tractors, agricultural machines, and fuel. Of this amount, 17 billion rubles will be used to maintain machine tractor stations and afforestation stations.

At the end of last year, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union adopted a decision on improving the work of machine and tractor stations, which is very important for the further development of various departments of agriculture and increasing the output of agricultural products.

Machine tractor stations must eliminate the existing serious shortcomings in the use of machines, must greatly improve the efficiency of machine tractor teams, improve the quality of work of collective farms, ensure that this work is completed in a shorter period of time, and meet the latest requirements of agricultural science, and ensure the completion of the task of reducing the cost of tractor work.

State farms also have important tasks in developing agriculture. In the post-war years, state farms have increased the output of agricultural products, increased crop yields, and increased the number of livestock and the productivity of products.

At the same time, the labor productivity of many state farms is not high enough, they have not observed the state discipline in terms of material consumption and funds, they exceed the quota in the consumption of fuel and raw materials, and the expenditure of wages also exceeds the regulations.

As a result of all this, these state farms have not completed the plans for the yield of crops per unit area and the productivity of livestock products, and they have not completed the plans for reducing production costs.

The important tasks of state farms are to develop multi-faceted agriculture, increase the yield of crops per unit area and the productivity of livestock products, improve labor productivity and more effectively use machines, so as to reduce production costs.

A large amount of funding in the budget is used to implement Stalin's plan to transform nature. In 1952, forests will be planted in vast areas, and many land improvement and irrigation works will be carried out.

It is also stipulated in 1952 to further expand retail trade, increase the variety of goods, and improve the quality of goods.

The heads of trade institutions are often not serious enough to demand that goods suppliers deliver goods on time, improve the quality of goods, and increase the variety of goods; they do not fully utilize the system of ordering all kinds of goods from industrial institutions, nor do they fully utilize local sources of goods.

The Ministry of Commerce of the Soviet Union and its local organs do not fully estimate the people's demand for certain items when formulating retail trade plans, and trade institutions do not fully consider the timely utilization of the funds prepared for them. When goods are delivered to trade institutions, they often do not take into account the seasonal requirements.

In some towns and rural areas, there are still phenomena of shortages on the one hand and surpluses of these goods in the warehouses of trade institutions on the other hand.

The tasks of trade institutions are to improve services to consumers, use commodity funds wisely, actively encourage industry to improve the quality of finished products and increase the variety of finished products, and improve their own economic and financial activities.

Expenditure on Social and Cultural Measures

The further development of socialist culture is one of the most important tasks in our country. The party of Lenin and Stalin believes that the high awareness of the Soviet people and their continuous development in culture and ideology are a powerful source of strength for the Soviet state and an extremely necessary condition for our advance towards communism.

The Soviet government pays great attention to the comprehensive education of our working people. After the Soviet government victoriously completed the work of implementing compulsory primary education nationwide before the war, it has now begun to implement the seven-year education system nationwide and is striving to develop the ten-year education system.

In 1952, 1,416,000 students will be studying in universities, 60,000 more than last year. The number of students in technical schools will increase by 57,000 to 1,441,000.

The Soviet social system has created unlimited opportunities for the progress of science, this true science, as Comrade Stalin pointed out,
"is not isolated from the people, nor is it far from them, but is ready to serve the people, giving them all the benefits of science, it does not serve the people reluctantly, but voluntarily and willingly."

The plan for 1952 stipulates that we should further develop the scientific research institutions that study how to use the forces of nature to benefit mankind, how to reduce labor, and how to improve productivity.

This year, 60 billion rubles have been allocated for education, 22.8 billion rubles for public health and sports, 37.5 billion rubles for social insurance and welfare, and 4.5 billion rubles for state allowances for mothers with many children and single mothers.

All these figures vividly reflect the constant concern of the Soviet government and Comrade Stalin himself for improving the material and cultural standards of the broad masses of the people.

The government pays great attention to improving the administrative organs of the Soviet Union and making them perfect. In the past few years, important work has been completed in simplifying state organs; state organs have improved their work and reduced expenses.

But there are still state organs and enterprises with too many people, and there are also things that violate the discipline of staffing and financial budgets.

In 1951, financial organs found that many enterprises belonging to the Ministry of Timber Industry, the Ministry of Meat and Dairy Industry, the Ministry of Automobile and Tractor Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and some other ministries had staffing exceeding the regulations.

The State Personnel Commission should work harder to reduce the excess personnel and simplify the structure of state organs, and financial organs must strengthen supervision to ensure that the organs comply with the staffing and budget system.

It is necessary to ensure further improvement of the quality of supervision and auditing work of financial organs and government departments and increase its efficiency. Auditors and accountants must not only discover violations of the financial system, but also strive to completely eliminate the defects that have been found.

Expenses for Consolidating Soviet National Defense

The Soviet Union is steadfastly pursuing a policy of peace and stands at the forefront of the struggle for international peace and friendship. The Soviet Union's peace-loving policy is determined by the nature of the Soviet state, the fundamental basis of the Soviet social system, and the vital interests of our people.

Comrade Stalin once pointed out: "The whole world has not only believed in the power of the Soviet state, but also believes that its policy based on the recognition of the equality of rights of all countries and based on respect for their freedom and independence is just. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union will still be faithful to its policy in the future—the policy of peace and security, the policy of international equality and friendship."

The peaceful policy pursued by the Soviet state relies on the invincible power of our country. Only short-sighted political leaders and open enemies of the Soviet state can believe that this peace-loving policy is a manifestation of the Soviet people's lack of confidence in their strength. Socialist countries adhere to the struggle for peace because it does not need war, because the Soviet people believe that wars of aggression are the most serious crimes against humanity.

The Soviet people, who are engaged in peaceful construction labor, vigilantly pay attention to the conspiracies of imperialist aggressors. Comrade Stalin said: "Of course, the aggressors hope that the Soviet Union will not be armed when they attack the Soviet Union. But the Soviet Union does not agree with this, and the Soviet Union believes that it should be fully prepared to deal with the aggressors."

The ruling groups of the United States, Britain, France, and other aggressive countries are actively preparing for a new world war and have allocated a large amount of funds for this. A large part of the budgets of these countries is swallowed up by war preparations and the expansion of armaments. Taking the United States as an example, even according to official statistics, its military appropriations have increased more than threefold last year, and currently account for more than 80 percent of the entire national budget. The military expenditures of Britain, France, and other aggressive countries have also increased sharply in recent years.

The imperialist aggressive policy of the US ruling group is most vividly manifested in the budget message for the 1952-1953 fiscal year recently proposed by the US President.

Despite the arrogance and boasting of Truman's message, it cannot hide the fear felt by the US ruling group, the growing dissatisfaction of the American people with their policies, and the intensification of contradictions within the imperialist camp are making them sleepless.

The Soviet Union is exactly the opposite of the aggressive imperialist countries. Its national budget, like in previous years, has most of its expenditures used on the national economy and on improving the material and cultural standards of the working people. The defense expenditure for 1952 is determined to be 113.8 billion rubles, accounting for 23.9 percent of the national budget. These allocations enable our country to implement the necessary measures to further strengthen the national defense of our motherland.

The Soviet Union has no plans for aggression. It does not threaten any country or any nation. Its armed forces are not conducting wars anywhere, nor are they participating in any military operations. The Soviet Union has a law to defend peace, the purpose of which is to strengthen international peace and friendship.

The peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union is an insurmountable barrier to the imperialist war mongers. The strength of this camp is expanding and growing stronger day by day. The peace movement is one of the greatest movements of our time, and a powerful and invincible force of our time. The basis of this great movement is the desire of millions of honest people in all countries to safeguard the cause of peace and avoid war.

Comrade Representatives! Under the inspiration of Stalin's plan to build communism, the Soviet people have shown selfless spirit and heroism in peaceful construction labor. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet people are victoriously and gradually completing the task of building communism.

The 1952 Soviet National Budget submitted to you by the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union stipulates sufficient funds to realize the huge measures planned by the Party and the government in further developing the national economy and further improving the happiness and culture of the Soviet people.

The task is to implement the budget in a timely manner, fully utilize the existing economic reserves, strive for economy in the expenditure of state funds, and ensure the further consolidation of the financial and credit system, so that the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble will be further improved. Victoriously implementing the national budget will be another important contribution to the cause of consolidating the economic strength of the Soviet state.

The working people of our country, united around the Bolshevik Party, will do their best to victoriously complete the national economic plan and the national budget, and will achieve new victories in building a communist society in 1952. We will confidently move towards this goal under the leadership of the great party of Lenin and Stalin, and under the leadership of our beloved leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin.

专栏：

    关于一九五二年苏联国家预算和一九五零年国家预算执行情形（续完）
    ——苏联财政部长兹维列夫在苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议三月六日联盟院和民族院联席会议上的报告全文
    政府各部以及各企业和经济机关的负责人员必须更为坚决地努力更加节约，这对于更进一步的经济发展是极其重要的。为了这个目的，必须经常地巩固成本核算作为社会主义管理的基本方法的地位，更为广泛地采行生产方面的节约方法，更加有效地利用国家拨给企业的物资和金钱。
    在这方面，财政机关和信用机构也起着重要的作用。然而，某些财政机关和信用机构的工作人员仍然没有能够保证有效地控制企业和机关的经济和财政活动，他们对于企业和经济机关的经济和财政情况的研究是不够的。
    吉尔吉斯和卡累利阿—芬兰两个加盟共和国的财政部去年就被发现了这方面工作中的严重缺点，它们没有十分彻底地检查某些企业和机关提出的概算和报告，在加强财政纪律和节俭地使用国家资金方面也没有足够的严格和严密。
    苏联财政部与财政机关以及国家银行及其机构日常必须在财政上加强对货物的生产与流通的控制。财政机关与信用机构必须严密监督减少生产成本和流通费用这些任务的履行、薪给款项的支出以及各企业与经济组织应归预算的款项之及时完全上缴。
    像上面所指出的，预算岁入的大部分来自社会主义经济。一九五二年苏联国家预算规定居民缴纳赋税四百七十四亿卢布，即全部岁入的百分之九点三。
    在过去一年里面，财政机关在徵收若干加盟共和国与若干州的居民的赋税上有着严重缺点。俄罗斯联邦的克拉斯诺达边疆区、奥勒尔、布利安斯克及其他一些州以及白俄罗斯共和国的格罗德诺州与明斯克州的农业税徵收计划没有及时完成。
    各共和国与州的财政机关应该改进它们的乡间税收活动，而各共和国部长会议和劳动人民代表苏维埃执行委员会应该在这一方面给各财政机关以必要的帮助。
    人民的自动贡献——公债，储蓄银行的存款，是很重要的。
    一九五一年发行的苏联国民经济发展公债的实际认购额比原订数额多四十八亿卢布。去年，收入不断增加的集体农民所购买的公债大大地增加了。
    今年规定从向人民和国家机关推销公债取得的收入为四百二十五亿卢布。公债资金将用于建筑伟大的共产主义建设工程和进行保证我们人民的物质和文化水准进一步提高的措施。
    人民物质福利的不断提高也使得储蓄银行吸收存款的工作加多。
    一九五一年，储蓄银行里的存款增加了四十亿卢布，而存户数目也增加了三百多万。一九五二年的计划要求储蓄银行的存款增加四十五亿卢布。国家保险事业在去年有了进一步的发展，今年将以相当大的款项用于这方面。集体农场作物和牲畜保险，和个人自愿保险一样地增加了。
    然而，国家保险事业需作重大的改进，特别是在自愿形式的保险方面。财政机关，首先是保险事业工作者必须扩大自愿保险的范围，并且增加收集保险费的工作。
    一九五二年苏联国家预算的支出
    代表同志们！我们的社会主义国家的生产力正以空前的速度向前发展着。
    根据斯大林同志的倡议正在实施的伟大的共产主义建设计划，对于我国生产力的进一步发展、对于社会财富及生活福利的增加都是特别重要的。伏尔加河—顿河的水道工程——伟大计划中的第一个计划——将于今年开始使用。
    世界上最大的水力工程的建设，以及工业、农业、运输、房屋建筑、科学、教育及卫生事业的进一步发展需要很大一笔预算开支。
    一九五二年苏联国家预算的支出总额规定为四千七百六十九亿卢布，其中一千八百零四亿卢布将用来发展国民经济，一千二百四十八亿卢布用来从事社会及文化事业设施，一千一百三十八亿卢布用于国防，一百四十四亿卢布用作国家行政机关的经费，八十九亿卢布支付人民的奖金及公债利息。
    一九五二年的预算开支将比一九五一年的预算开支多三百五十六亿卢布或百分之八点一。
    看了上面的数字就可以明白：国家预算经费的最大部分是用在国民经济及文化事业上的。
    国民经济的财政管理
    今年，预算中规定用于国民经济的资金有半数以上将用于基本建设。
    一九五二年供投资与增加建设工作流动资金之用的款项定为一千四百三十一亿卢布，其中九百八十一亿卢布来自预算，四百五十亿卢布来自企业与经济机关的资金。
    以一九五一年与一九五○年相比，建筑机关减低了建设成本，并且缩短了建设时间。
    但是，重工业企业建造部、重型机器制造部、煤业部、电站部和机器与器械制造部所辖若干机构却没有保证达到国家计划所规定的减低建设成本的目标，因为在建设工作的组织和建筑业所拥有的大量建筑机件的利用方面存在着严重的缺点。
    建设工程上没有充分利用机器以及把建筑机件搁置不用的事还不少。
    在重工业企业建造部所属“捷尔仁斯基建筑工程管理处”、“马卡耶夫卡建筑工程管理处”两个托辣斯的机构内，由于整个工作阵线组织的不适当和意外的修理与损坏，还时常让掘凿机、装土机和起重机闲在那里。一九五一年，在卡马水力发电站建筑工地，起重机和拖拉机牵引的铲土机在三分之一以上的工作时间内空闲着。在许多建筑工地，汽车运输工作组织得不适当，让汽车空闲着或是空着跑来跑去。
    一些机关超过定额使用建筑材料，透支工资金，并且支付过多的杂费。
    重工业企业建造部所辖第五托辣斯第二部在一九五一年九个月内所使用的材料超过估计数量的情形如下：锯好的木材超过估计数量百分之二十三，铁质屋顶材料超过估计数量百分之三十二；石灰超过估计数量百分之五十三。
    在一九五一年的十个月内，煤业部所辖克拉斯诺雅尔斯克矿业建设管理处的纳萨罗夫建筑与装配管理处透支工资几达一百万卢布，所用建筑材料费超过原订计划二十万零五千卢布。
    苏联建筑材料工业部托辣斯所进行的巴什耶斯克水泥工厂的建筑工程，在一九五一年的九个月内所支付的杂费超过估计一倍以上。
    政府各部门领导人应该对履行减低建设成本的任务予以监督，应该严格遵守政府对于建设中的工程所规定的落成时限，更好地利用建筑机器，不允许原料支出超过规定的估计，并且要减少杂费。
    长期投资银行必须对于履行减低建设成本的任务进行系统的监督，但是却不能经常完成这项重要工作。例如，阿塞拜疆、乌兹别克、利森及文尼萨等地的工业银行办事处没有对于物资与工资金的使用建立必要的监督，没有对建筑工程的蓝图与估计进行充分的检查，没有作必要的斗争来加强建筑工程的财政纪律和会计纪律。
    各长期投资银行应改进它们的工作，并对建设的进程施以严格的财政监督。
    一九五二年，企业和经济机关的流动资金将比一九五一年多一百零七亿卢布。流动资金的增加是为了适应生产与贸易数量的增加而决定的，并且考虑到减低生产成本的任务。此外，在一九五二年内，国民经济中资金的周转率必须进一步加速。
    国家预算指拨的四十六亿卢布和由国民经济的利润及其他国内经济来源提供的六十一亿卢布将用来增加本年度的流动资金。在为增加各企业自己的流动资金而筹措资金上，由各企业本身的资源提供的那一部分将增加到百分之五十七点二，而在一九五一年则为百分之五十二点六。这就使企业和经济机构的领导人对于履行减低生产成本，取得利润和加速商品与物资的周转率这方面的任务负有很大责任。
    最近几年，国民经济中的流动资金的使用已经改进了。各中央工业部门所辖企业中分配到的商品和物资的周转率在一九五一年的九个月里比一九五○年同一时期加快百分之四。
    但是，在若干部门所属企业的流动资金的使用方面仍然存在着重大缺点；找寻和利用剩余的与不必要的原料的工作没有好好地组织起来；储存的原料、材料、燃料和制成品的数量也是超过计划的。
    超计划堆积起来的商品与物资时常是和生产的不平衡及政府若干部在组织原料和设备的供应上的严重缺点有关的。
    例如，在汽车与拖拉机工业部所辖米提什奇机器制造厂，一九五一年全年平均每月上旬生产百分之十八，中旬生产百分之二十七点一，下旬生产百分之五十四点九。工厂工作的这种不平衡情况使工人在很多的时间内无事可做，使设备的利用率低落，造成了商品和物资超过估计的大量剩余；这些剩余在一九五二年一月一日共值一千一百多万卢布。
    政府各部的各中央管理处以及供应机构在给各个企业分配指拨给它们的资金时，时常分配不当，而在供应原料给各个企业时也缺乏灵活性。
    例如，建造及筑路机器制造部属下的维克沙工厂在一九五一年的九个月中只需要二千八百二十七吨合金钢板，可是实际拨给该厂的钢板竟有四千零四十八吨。铁条、输送带、发动机和柴油机等帮助生产的物资的拨付也超过实际需要很多。
    有一回，中央管理局命令拨付燃料给重型机器制造部属下的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克工厂，但是却没有计算到原来积存的燃料。结果，该厂的煤斤存量大大地超过了原来的定额，造成了大量煤的损失，增加了许多不生产的开销。
    各部和各企业的负责人必须更加注意计划和使用流动资金的问题，更加注意物资和装备供应的组织问题，不要让太大量的货物和物资积压下来，并应该按照苏联部长会议的命令及时地处理这些物资。
    这一切都是更进一步改进企业和机构的经济财政活动的必要条件。    
    财政机关和国家银行的各级组织必须经常地监督各企业和机构的情况，监督它们的流动资金和银行贷款的使用情况。
    然而，应该指出，某些财政和信用机关却没有充分履行它们的责任，没有充分地监督各企业和机构流动资金的使用情况。在这方面，工作最坏的是塔吉克和奔萨两个地方的国家银行分行，它们没有进行必要的斗争，以消除各企业和贸易机构积压超过估计的货物和物资的现象，也没有责成它们及时地进行经济核算和遵守财政纪律。
    财政和信用机关的工作人员必须消灭目前的缺点，大大地改进他们的工作。
    国家预算中规定一九五二年用于农业和林业的开支为三百四十七亿卢布，决定这个数字时曾考虑到拖拉机、农业机器和燃料价格的降低。这笔款项中，一百七十亿卢布将用来维持机器拖拉机站和造林站。
    去年年底，苏联部长会议通过一项关于改进机器与拖拉机站工作的决定，这个决定对于进一步发展农业各部门和增加农产品产量是很重要的。
    机器拖拉机站必须消灭使用机器方面的现有严重缺点，必须大大提高机器拖拉机队的效率，改进集体农场工作的质量，保证这种工作在较短的时间内完成，并且符合农业科学的最近的要求，保证完成减低拖拉机工作费用的任务。
    国家农场面前也有着发展农业的重大任务。在战后年份里，国家农场增加了农产品的产量，提高了作物的收获量，增加了牲畜的头数和产物生产率。
    同时，许多国家农场的劳动生产率还不够高，还没有遵守材料消耗与资金方面的国家纪律，在燃料和原料的消费方面超过定额，并且工资的开支也超过了规定。
    由于这一切的结果，这些国家农场没有完成单位面积作物产量和牲畜产物生产率的计划，它们也没有完成减低生产成本的计划。
    国家农场的重要任务是发展多方面的农业，提高单位面积作物产量和牲畜产物生产率，改进劳动生产率和更有效地使用机器，借以减低生产成本。
    预算中有大量经费是用于实现斯大林的改造自然计划的。一九五二年要在广大的地区植林，要进行许多改良土地的工作和灌溉工作。
    一九五二年并规定要进一步扩展零售贸易，增加货物的种类并改良货物的质量。
    贸易机构的负责人常常不够认真要求货物供应者按时交货，改良货品的质量和增加货物的种类；他们不充分利用各种货物都向工业机构定货的制度，也不充分利用本地的商品来源。
    苏联商业部及其所属的地方机关在订出零售贸易计划时不充分估计到人民对某些物品的要求，而贸易机构则不充分考虑到及时利用为它们准备的经费。货物交付给贸易机构时，常常不考虑到季节的要求。
    在某些城镇和乡区里，仍发生一方面缺货而另一方面这些货物却在贸易机构的仓库里有着剩余的现象。
    贸易机构的任务是改良对消费者的服务，精明地运用商品基金，积极地鼓励工业改良成品的质量和增加成品的种类，并改进它们自己的经济和财政活动。
    社会文化措施的开支
    社会主义文化的进一步发展是我国最重要的任务之一。列宁和斯大林的党认为苏联人民的高度觉悟，他们在文化和思想方面的不断发展是产生苏维埃国家力量的一个强大泉源，是我们向共产主义前进的一个极端必要的条件。
    苏维埃政府对我国劳动人民的全面教育给予极大注意。苏维埃政府在战前胜利地完成了实现全国强迫初级教育的工作以后，现在已在全国开始实行七年教育制，并且正在竭力发展十年教育制。
    一九五二年将有一百四十一万六千学生在高等学校攻读，这比去年多六万人。技术学校的学生人数将增加五万七千人而达一百四十四万一千人。
    苏维埃的社会制度为科学的进步创造了无限的机会，这种真正的科学，如斯大林同志所指出的，
    “并不是与人民隔绝的，也不是远离他们的，而是准备为人民服务，给予他们科学的一切利益，它并不是被迫地而是自愿地，甘心地为人民服务。”
    一九五二年的计划规定要进一步发展各个研究怎样利用自然力量来造福人类，怎样减轻劳动、提高生产率的科学研究机关。
    今年拨充教育之用的有六百亿卢布，公共卫生和体育二百二十八亿卢布，社会保险和福利三百七十五亿卢布，国家给多子母亲和单身母亲的津贴四十五亿卢布。
    这一切数字鲜明地反映出苏联政府和斯大林同志本人对于提高广大阶层人民的物质和文化水准的经常关怀。
    政府很注意改进苏联的行政机构，使之臻于完善。在过去几年内，在简化国家机关方面完成了重要工作；国家机关已改进了它的工作，减少了经费。
    但是现在仍有用人过多的国家机关和企业，也有破坏关于人员编制和财政概算方面的纪律的事情。
    在一九五一年内，财政机关发觉在许多属于木材工业部、肉乳工业部、汽车与拖拉机工业部、铁道部和若干其他部的企业中有人员编制超过规定的事情。
    国家人事委员会应该更努力地裁减超额人员和简化国家机关的机构，而财政机关必须加强监督，使各机关遵守人员编制和概算方面的制度。
    必须保证进一步改进财政机关，政府各部门的监督和审核工作的质量并增加其效率。审计员和查账员必须不仅限于发现破坏财政制度的事情，也应努力使已发见的缺点完全消除。
    巩固苏维埃国防的费用
    苏联在坚定不移地奉行着和平政策，并且站在争取国际和平与友好的斗争的最前线。苏联爱好和平的政策是由苏维埃国家的性质、苏维埃社会制度的根本的基础和我国人民的切身利益所确定的。
    斯大林同志曾经指出：“全世界已经不仅相信苏维埃国家的威力，而且相信它的以承认一切国家权利平等为基础、以尊重它们的自由和独立为基础的政策是正义的。无须怀疑，苏联将来还是要忠实于它的政策——和平与安全的政策，国际权利平等和友好的政策。”
    苏维埃国家所执行的和平政策是依靠于我国的无敌的威力的。只有眼光短浅的政治领袖和苏维埃国家的公开敌人才能认为这种爱好和平的政策是苏联人民对于他们的力量没有把握的表现。社会主义国家坚持不渝地为争取和平而斗争，因为它不需要战争，因为苏联人民认为侵略战争是对人类犯下的最严重的罪行。
    从事和平建设劳动的苏联人民警觉地注意着帝国主义侵略者的阴谋。斯大林同志说：“当然，侵略者希望一旦他们进攻苏联的时候，苏联没有武装。但是苏联不同意这样，苏联认为它应有充分的准备来对付侵略者。”
    美国、英国、法国和其他侵略国家的统治集团正在积极准备新的世界大战，并拨了大量款项供这方面的开销。这些国家的预算很大一部分被战争准备和扩张军备的开销吞噬去了。以美国的情形为例，即使根据官方统计，它的军事拨款在去年增加三倍多，目前占全部国家预算百分之八十还多。英国、法国和其他侵略国家的军事开支在近几年来也激烈增加。
    美国统治集团的帝国主义侵略政策，在美国总统最近提出的一九五二—一九五三财政年度的预算咨文里最生动地表现了出来。
    杜鲁门这个咨文的口气尽管那么嚣张和吹嘘，却掩盖不了美国统治集团感到的忧惧，美国人民对他们的政策的日益不满，帝国主义阵营内部矛盾的加剧都是使他们寝食不安的。
    苏联就恰恰和侵略性的帝国主义国家相反，它的国家预算跟往年一样，大部分开支用在国民经济上面，用在改善劳动人民的物质和文化水准上面。一九五二年的国防费用决定为一千一百三十八亿卢布，占国家预算百分之二十三点九。这些拨款使我国可能实行必要的措施，以便进一步加强我们祖国的国防。
    苏联并没有侵略计划。它并没有威胁任何国家或任何民族。它的武装部队并没有在任何地方进行战争，也没有参加任何军事行动。苏联有一个保卫和平法，目的是要加强国际和平与友好。
    以苏联为首的和平民主阵营是帝国主义战争贩子无可奈何的障壁。这个阵营的力量在一天天地扩展壮大。和平运动是我们当代最伟大的运动之一，是我们当代强大的不可征服的力量。这个伟大的运动的基础是各国千百万正直的人民维护和平事业和避免战争的愿望。
    代表同志们！苏联人民在斯大林的建设共产主义计划的鼓舞之下，在和平建设劳动方面表现了忘我精神和英雄主义。苏联人民在布尔什维克党的领导之下，正在胜利地逐步完成共产主义建设的任务。
    苏联部长会议提交你们通过的一九五二年苏联国家预算，规定了足够的款项来实现党及政府所计划的，在进一步发展国民经济、进一步增进苏联人民的幸福和文化方面的巨大的措施。
    任务是要及时执行预算，充分利用经济上现有的后备力量，在国家资金的开支上力求节约，保证进一步巩固财政和信用制度，使苏联卢布的购买力进一步提高。胜利地执行国家预算对巩固苏维埃国家经济力量的事业将是另一重要贡献。
    团结在布尔什维克党周围的我国劳动人民将尽全力来胜利完成国民经济计划和国家预算，并将于一九五二年在建设共产主义社会方面取得新的胜利。我们将在列宁和斯大林的伟大的党的领导下，在敬爱的领袖和导师斯大林同志的领导下满怀信心地向这个目标迈进。
