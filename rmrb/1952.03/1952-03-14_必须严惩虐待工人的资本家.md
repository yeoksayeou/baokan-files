Capitalists Who Abuse Workers Must Be Severely Punished
Xue Feng

Reports like the one published in the March 8th "People's Daily" entitled "Female Workers in Various Regions Accuse Capitalists of Abusing and Persecuting Female Workers" should be read by everyone, and even more so, should not be taken lightly after reading.

I think that people who are not usually familiar with the situation of female workers in these private enterprises after the victory of the revolution will definitely be shocked after reading it and can't help but shout: "Capitalists! Have you forgotten what era this is!"

Needless to say, our country is now led by the working class; that is, the working class occupies the position of the main ruler. However, after reading the examples listed in the report, capitalists are using feudal and barbaric methods, using the methods of slave owners treating slaves, and using the methods of imperialists treating colonial people and Kuomintang prison guards treating prisoners, to rule female workers, to rule the working class!

Using iron nails and wooden sticks to beat; kicking in the abdomen; piercing eyelids with iron wire; dragging young female workers by the ears around the workshop; inserting chopsticks into the mouth; scalding breasts with boiling water... As for hitting the palms of the hands and slapping the face at every turn, it is simply not worth mentioning. Naturally, there are also female workers who cannot bear the abuse and commit suicide by drowning. In addition, all kinds of insults and arbitrary deprivation of human rights, as well as super-economic feudal exploitation, are clearly written in the report, so there is no need to repeat them.

How is this different from the capitalists' oppression and abuse of workers during the Kuomintang reactionary rule?

But if this was the daily routine of capitalists abusing workers during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and the working class therefore rose up to fight, then now that capitalists dare to do so, they should be fought against even more, and should be given severe punishment by law under public indignation!

These capitalists have forgotten the times! But we must not forget the reactionary class nature of the bourgeoisie and its rampant face!

These examples can also shut the mouths of the bourgeoisie's apologists, who close their eyes and actually betray their conscience, stubbornly claiming that the bourgeoisie has not attacked the working class. At the same time, it should awaken those with right-leaning thoughts, who should open their eyes to see such realities that still exist.

In short, the bourgeoisie's reactionary thoughts and actions must be crushed, and the democratic reforms in all private enterprises must be thoroughly carried out!

    必须严惩虐待工人的资本家
    雪峰
    像三月八日“人民日报”所载“各地女工控诉资本家虐待和迫害女工的罪行”这样的报道，是每一个人都应该看一看的，看了更不应该等闲视之。
    我想，平日不大熟悉革命胜利以后这些私营企业中女工情况的人，看了一定都会大吃一惊，禁不住要叫起来罢：“资本家！你们忘记了现在是什么时代！”
    用不到说，现在我们国家是工人阶级领导的；也就是，工人阶级居在主要统治者的地位上。然而，看了报道中所列举的实例，却是资本家们在用封建野蛮的办法，用奴隶主虐待奴隶的办法，用帝国主义者对待殖民地人民和国民党狱吏对待囚徒的手段，在统治着女工们，在统治着工人阶级！
    用铁钉和木棍打；用脚踢腹部；用铁丝刺眼皮；拉着女童工的耳朵在车道里绕圈子；用筷子插嘴；用开水烫乳房，……至于动辄打手心、打耳光，简直不值得提了。也自然就有受不了虐打而投河自杀的女工。此外，种种的侮辱和任意剥夺人权，以及超经济的封建剥削，报道中都清楚地写着，用不到重述了。
    这和国民党反动统治时代，资本家压迫和虐待工人，有什么两样？
    但如果在国民党反动统治时代，这是资本家虐待工人的家常便饭，而工人阶级就因此起而斗争；那么，在现在，资本家还胆敢如此，那就应该加倍与之斗争，应该在公愤之下用法律给以严厉的惩处！
    这些资本家们忘记了时代！但我们却不可以忘记资产阶级的反动的阶级本性及其猖狂的面目！
    这些事例，也可以使资产阶级的说客们闭嘴，他们闭着眼睛，实际上是昧着良心，硬说资产阶级没有向工人阶级进攻。同时也应该使思想右倾者惊醒，他们应该张开眼睛来看看还存在着的这样的现实。
    总之，必须粉碎资产阶级的这样反动的思想和行动，而一切私营企业中的民主改革是必须彻底进行的！
