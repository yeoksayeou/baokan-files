To Mayor Peng:

We are female workers who, after the closure of brothels, studied at the Women's Production and Education Center or the Huaxing Factory and returned to the Jiefang Weaving Factory last November. We have completed the first three months of study. We would like to report to you our feelings and production situation since returning to the factory. We believe you will be interested to know.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have been saved and are growing stronger day by day.

As the saying goes, "Newly recovered legs are weak, and a blind man who suddenly sees the sun cannot open his eyes." In the old society, we were deceived and abused from a young age, so we dared not trust anyone. After liberation, although the government rescued us from that living-dead hell, our minds still harbored remnants of poison and concerns. At that time, we were unwilling to work, believing that nothing was as reliable as finding a wealthy husband, and worrying that the government could not truly be responsible for us. Therefore, we left the factory one after another. After we stumbled around alone for more than a year, encountering many difficulties and suffering a lot of pain, we understood the sentence that our comrades often taught us in the past: only by participating in labor can we achieve true liberation.

Especially when we saw our sisters who stayed in the factory, relying closely on the government and their own laboring hands, transforming into useful technical workers of the country and being respected everywhere, we all felt extremely regretful and suffered great mental pain. At that time, we thought, what can be done now? Would the government still set up a factory for us? We never expected that when you heard our requests and pain, you established the Jiefang Weaving Factory again last November, liberating us once more. You treated us politically and economically as apprentices, not only teaching us technical skills and life skills but also treating our illnesses again, and making cotton clothes for us when the weather was cold! How much money have you spent on us, one after another! Most of our sisters were sold from a young age and had never felt the love of parents, and some were even pushed into the fire pit by their own parents when they grew up. In the past two years, what the People's Government has done has made us deeply feel that the People's Government is even closer than our own mothers. Many sisters were moved to tears at meetings, in group discussions, and during casual conversations. When we returned to the factory, some people said that the government was only taking care of people like us. Those who said this did not understand how the People's Government is responsible for the people to the end, and how the Communist Party cherishes the people who suffered oppression and abuse in the old society. Who says we have no relatives? We have the Communist Party, our reborn parents.

After the anti-corruption movement began, we reported twenty-seven embezzlers, and six sisters also reported their husbands' tax evasion or corruption. After studying, we understood that corrupt elements who steal state property are enemies of our national construction. In order to protect the construction of our motherland, and also to protect our future, no matter who he is, even if he is our husband, as long as he is corrupt, we will resolutely report him.

In the anti-corruption movement, we discovered that the bourgeois, especially the corrupt ideology remnants of the most vicious landlords, were also eroding us. We had shortcomings in our work, life, style, and feelings. The People's Government cherishes and cultivates us, and the anti-corruption movement cured our illnesses. We unhesitatingly and boldly exposed the vicious scars left to us by the landlords. Our slogan is that you can’t cure the illness if it doesn’t hurt, and we spent half a month exposing these scars, changing our erroneous stance of recognizing thieves as fathers and not distinguishing between enemies and ourselves, and eradicating the ideological roots of not working for gain, corruption, and decadence. At meetings, large and small, we heard sisters painfully telling their inner feelings. In the past, the landlords taught us how to steal and how to deceive. Later, we became accustomed to it, and we couldn’t do without stealing. Under the abuse of this group of tigers and wolves, we were not like humans! If we hadn't been liberated, who knows what we would have become now.

Like pouring clean water into a bottle after pouring out dirty water, after our minds became clear, our production also improved with the improvement of our awareness. In the month before the anti-corruption movement, our first-class cloth accounted for 68.6 percent. In the month during the anti-corruption movement, it accounted for 86.7 percent. Before the anti-corruption movement, only the day shift was open. After the anti-corruption movement, the entire factory only added a cook, and the day and night shifts were successfully opened. Most people increased the number of looms they watched. Production increased, and the absenteeism rate was reduced by half. What power has improved our production morale? This is because we have recognized two truths from the things we have come into contact with, especially in this anti-corruption movement study: one is that the Communist Party and the People's Government are truly for the people, and we must respond to all calls of the Communist Party and the People's Government; the other is that only by participating in labor can we achieve true liberation.

There is also one thing we want to protest against the criminal acts of American imperialism in spreading germs in Korea and Northeast China. Usually, when several workers in the factory were found to have lice, the People's Government Health Bureau immediately sent medical personnel to thoroughly exterminate the lice and test the blood in order to protect our health. Our People's Government is so considerate of the people in every way. However, American imperialism inhumanely spreads germs to kill humans. From these two completely opposite behaviors, we have a deeper understanding that our People's Government is for the people. In order to ensure future happiness and defeat the American robbers, we guarantee to work hard in production, become self-sufficient starting from March, and complete the six-month study task one month ahead of schedule.

With respect,
All female workers of Beijing Jiefang Weaving Factory

### 北京解放织布工厂女工写信给彭真市长  报告她们在反贪污运动中进一步肃清了腐化堕落思想，认识了只有参加劳动才能真正得到解放

    北京解放织布工厂女工写信给彭真市长
    报告她们在反贪污运动中进一步肃清了腐化堕落思想，认识了只有参加劳动才能真正得到解放
    彭市长：我们是封闭妓院后在妇女生产教养院或华兴工厂学习过，在去年十一月又回到解放织布工厂的女工。我们已经结束了上半期三个月的学习。我们愿意把我们重新回到工厂的感想和生产情况报告给您，想来您一定愿意知道。
    在共产党毛主席的领导下我们得救了，而且一天天的健壮起来了。
    俗语说：“大病刚好的腿软，乍见太阳的瞎子睁不开眼”，在旧社会里我们从小就受欺骗，受糟踏，所以对谁也不敢相信。解放后，我们虽然被政府从那种活不得、死不了的火坑里救了出来，但是思想里仍有遗毒和顾虑。我们当时不愿意劳动，认为甚么都不如找个有钱的丈夫可靠，顾虑政府不能对我们真正负责。因此，我们就陆续离开了工厂。当我们在外边独自撞了一年多，碰到很多困难，受了很多痛苦时，我们才懂得了过去同志们常常教育我们的一句话：只有参加劳动，才能得到真正的解放。
    特别是看到留厂的姐妹们，她们紧紧地依靠政府和自己劳动的双手，都变成国家有用的技术工人，到处受人尊敬时，我们都极后悔，精神上感到很大痛苦。当时我们想，这又有什么办法呢？政府还能再为我们办工厂吗？我们完全没有想到，当您听到我们的要求和痛苦后，在去年十一月就又成立了解放织布工厂，又一次解放我们。对我们在政治上、经济上按学徒工待遇，不只是教我们学技术，学生活的本领，还又一次给我们治病，天气冷时又给我们作棉衣服，前前后后为我们花了多少钱！我们大部分姐妹从小就被卖出，没有感受过父母的爱，甚至有几个是长大后被亲父母推到火坑里去的。两年来，人民政府所作所为，使我们深刻地感到人民政府比亲母亲还亲，许多姐妹不论在大会上、小组会上以及平时聊天时都感动得落泪。在我们回到工厂时，有人说，政府尽照顾你们这样儿的人。说这话的人，他们不懂得人民政府是如何对人民负责到底的，共产党是如何爱护曾遭受旧社会压迫糟踏的人民的。谁说我们无亲无故？我们有再生的父母共产党。
    反贪污运动开始后，我们检举了二十七名贪污分子，还有六个姐妹检举了丈夫漏税或贪污的行为。经过学习，我们懂得盗窃国家财产的贪污分子是我们建设祖国的敌人。为了保障我们祖国的建设，也同样保障我们的前途，不管他是谁，就是我们的丈夫也好，只要他贪污，我们就坚决检举他。
    在反贪污运动中，我们发现资产阶级，特别是资产阶级中最恶毒的领家恶霸们的腐化思想残余也侵蚀着我们，我们在工作、生活、作风、感情上都存在着缺点。人民政府爱护和培养我们，反贪污运动治了我们的病。我们毫不犹豫地大胆揭露了领家恶霸们留给我们的恶毒疮疤。我们的口号是不疼治不了病，我们花了半个月的时间揭去这些疮疤，改变了那认贼作父、分不清敌我的错误立场，连根拔掉不劳而获、腐化堕落的思想臭根儿，在大会上、小会上，都听到姐妹们痛苦地诉说心里的话。从前领家教我们如何偷、如何骗，后来我们成了习惯，不偷都不成了。在他们的带领下，我们从来没说过
    一句真话，整天是捉摸骗钱打扮。在这群虎狼的糟踏下，我们那像人呀！如不是被解放了，现在说不定成了个什么样子。
    像一个瓶子倒出臭水灌入了清水似的，心里明静后，我们的生产也就随着觉悟的提高而提高了。反贪污运动前的一个月，我们一等布占百分之六十八点六，反贪污运动进行中一个月占百分之八十六点七，反贪污运动前只开了白班，反贪污运动后全厂只添了一个厨子，就顺利地开了日夜班两班。大多数人都增看了一台织机。产量提高了，欠勤率也减低了一半。什么力量使我们的生产情绪提高了呢？这是因为我们从所接触的事物上，特别是在这次反贪污运动学习中认清了两条真理：一条是共产党、人民政府是真正为人民的，我们要响应共产党和人民政府的一切号召；另一条是，只有参加劳动，才能得到真正的解放。
    还有一件事，我们要对美帝国主义在朝鲜和东北撒布细菌的罪恶行为提出抗议。平时，工厂里发现有几个工人生虱子，人民政府卫生局为了保护我们的身体健康，就马上派医务人员来彻底灭虱，验血，我们的人民政府是这样处处为人民着想。而美帝国主义却无人性地撒布细菌杀害人类。从这两种完全相反的行为中，我们更深刻地体会到我们的人民政府是为人民的。为了保障将来的幸福，打垮美国强盗，我们保证努力生产，自三月份起开始作到自给自足，并提前一个月完成半年的学习任务。敬礼
    北京解放织布工厂全体女工
