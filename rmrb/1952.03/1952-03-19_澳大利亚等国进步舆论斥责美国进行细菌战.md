Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, March 17th, Elect Telegraph Agency: This issue of the Australian Communist Party newspaper "The Guardian" (published in Brisbane) states that the United States' germ warfare in Korea "is a new barbarous action. The Menzies government, which obeys American orders, treats Japanese fascists as allies, and sends Australian troops to their deaths in Korea, should be held responsible for this action."

The newspaper said: World opinion must stop this germ warfare, just as world opinion once used the Stockholm Appeal to stop the imperialists from using atomic bombs.

Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: The people of Israel and Lebanon protest against the heinous crime of American imperialism in conducting germ warfare.

According to the Telegraph Agency, Tel Aviv, March 17th: The Israeli Communist Party newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary stating that the war criminals in the White House in Washington and the headquarters of Ridgway in Tokyo have committed heinous crimes and cannot escape responsibility. "People's Voice" pointed out that the peace-loving people of Israel, together with all justice-minded people around the world, will protest against the new atrocities committed by the American aggressors in Korea and resolutely demand an end to the germ warfare in Korea.

According to TASS, Beirut, March 17th: The Lebanese newspaper "Al-Telegraph" reported that a delegation from the Beirut Non-Denominational Higher School visited the newspaper's editorial department and left a protest letter against the American imperialists' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea. The delegation condemned this shameful act of American imperialism, which aims to massacre people in large numbers through plague and other infectious diseases.

    澳大利亚等国进步舆论斥责美国进行细菌战
    【新华社十八日讯】电通社墨尔本十七日讯：本期的澳大利亚共产党的报纸“卫报”（在布利斯班出版）说：美国在朝鲜进行细菌战“是一种新的野蛮行动。听从美国命令把日本法西斯当做盟国并派遣澳大利亚军队去朝鲜送死的孟席斯政府，对于这种行动应该负责”。
    该报说：全世界舆论必须阻止这种细菌战，一如世界舆论曾经通过斯德哥尔摩宣言，制止帝国主义者使用原子弹一样。
    【新华社十八日讯】以色列和黎巴嫩的人民抗议美帝国主义进行细菌战的滔天罪行。
    据电通社特拉维夫十七日讯：以色列共产党报纸“人民呼声报”发表评论说：华盛顿白宫和东京李奇微总部的战争罪犯们犯了滔天罪行，是逃避不了责任的。“人民呼声报”指出：以色列爱好和平的人民将和全世界有正义感的人民一道，抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜所犯的新暴行，并坚决要求停止在朝鲜进行的细菌战。
    另据塔斯社贝鲁特十七日讯：黎巴嫩报纸“电讯报”报道：贝鲁特非宗教高等学校的代表团曾访问该报编辑部，并留下一份抗议美帝国主义者在朝鲜使用细菌武器的抗议书。代表团谴责美帝国主义这种旨在借鼠疫和其他传染病来大批屠杀人民的可耻行为。
