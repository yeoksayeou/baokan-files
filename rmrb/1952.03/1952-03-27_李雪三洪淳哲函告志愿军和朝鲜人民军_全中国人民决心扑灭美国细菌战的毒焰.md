    Li Xuesan and Hong Chunzhe's Letter to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army:
    The Entire Chinese People are Determined to Extinguish the Poisonous Flames of American Bacteriological Warfare
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 26th] Li Xuesan, head of the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning from the DPRK, and Hong Chunzhe, head of the delegation of the Korean People's Delegation to China, who are visiting Wuhan, wrote a letter to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, reporting the determination of the broad masses of the Chinese people to oppose American imperialism's bacteriological warfare. The original letter is as follows: Dear Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army!
    Since the newspapers revealed the news that the American imperialists, nearing their demise, were spreading bacteria in large quantities, vainly attempting to salvage their irreparable defeat, we have seen in East China and Central South hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, scientists, revolutionary army family members, and students' anger and hatred towards this shameless crime of American imperialism, and heard the common voice of hundreds of millions of people: "Resolutely support the front line with practical actions and extinguish the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism!"
    Countless people have expressed to us: "We will never allow American imperialism to use bacteriological weapons to run rampant against humanity again!" When we arrived in Hangzhou, Zhou Shuigen, a worker at the Fuhua No. 1 Silk Factory, said: "When I was thirteen years old, Japanese devils' planes spread plague bacteria in Quzhou, and my father died at the hands of Japanese bandits! Now, the American bandits dare to openly collude with Japanese bacteriological war criminals like Shiro Ishii to carry out inhumane bacteriological warfare, which I resolutely cannot tolerate! I want to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions!" Zheng Jiean and Wang Yuzhen, technicians of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, saw the tragic suffering of the local peaceful people from the plague in Ningbo and Quzhou in 1940. Those who suffered from the poisonous effects of the Japanese bacteriological warfare were either bedridden, or their whole families were infected and died without anyone to collect their bodies. They expressed great anger at this monstrous crime. They said: "For twelve years, the people of Zhejiang have fresh memories of this. The American bandits are now spreading bacteria in large quantities again, once again proving that they are our mortal enemies. Today, we have the strength and determination to defeat American imperialism's bacteriological warfare!"
    In Guangzhou, there are also tens of millions of people expressing their determination to oppose bacteriological warfare to us. All the military dependents in Jixiang Street, Yuexiu District, wrote to us, saying: "We feel extremely angry at this inhumane and crazy behavior of the American army! We have written to our children on the front lines in Korea, encouraging them to annihilate more American aggressor troops. We vow to improve household sideline production and strive to enhance the strength of resistance against America and aid to Korea." Li Ting, director of the Bacteriological Research Institute of Zhongshan University, said: "In order to extinguish the poisonous flames of the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare, we have prepared everything. As soon as the motherland calls, we will rush to the front line to eliminate germs and serve the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and peaceful residents." Xu Maoyong, Secretary-General of Wuhan University, told us: "We have already formed an anti-bacteriological warfare organization and trained a large number of anti-bacteriological warfare cadres. Wherever they are needed, we will go there to serve and strive to extinguish the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare!" Medical workers from the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Medical Association and Xiangya Hospital in Changsha have all formed volunteer anti-bacteriological warfare epidemic prevention teams, waiting to depart.
    When we arrived in Hunan Province, we visited the hometown of the Chinese people's leader, Chairman Mao. Mao Renqiu, the responsible cadre of the township, said to us with excitement on behalf of the farmers in the township: "Please tell Commander Peng Dehuai, General Kim Il-sung, and all the comrades of the Volunteers and the People's Army that we are determined to continue to strengthen the work of resisting America and aiding Korea with practical actions, support the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, and completely defeat all the vicious conspiracies of American imperialism!"
    The comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who are defending the national defense of the motherland, have also unanimously expressed that they will learn modern military technology well, raise their vigilance, and do their best to safeguard the security of the motherland and world peace.
    Comrades who are carrying out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements have expressed that they will eliminate embezzlers and thieves and do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy to support us!
    Comrades! Japanese imperialism used bacteriological weapons, but it could not save it from failure; today, American imperialism will also not be able to use bacteriological weapons to save it from failure. The Chinese people who have stood up are continuing to organize epidemic prevention teams in a fighting posture, and the people of the democratic countries, headed by the Soviet Union, are unanimously sympathizing with and helping us. We will surely smash all the conspiracies of the American aggressors. Comrades! Work hard! We have achieved a series of victories on the Korean battlefield. Today, on the front line of resisting the American aggressors' bacteriological warfare, we will surely achieve greater victories! Let us continue to answer the Chinese people's support for us with new victories!
    Li Xuesan, Head of the Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers Returning from the DPRK
    Hong Chunzhe, Head of the Delegation of the Korean People's Delegation to China

    李雪三洪淳哲函告志愿军和朝鲜人民军
    全中国人民决心扑灭美国细菌战的毒焰
    【新华社汉口二十六日电】在武汉市访问的中国人民志愿军归国代表团团长李雪三和朝鲜人民访华代表团团长洪淳哲，写信给中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，报告全中国广大人民反对美帝国主义进行细菌战的决心。原信如下：亲爱的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军同志们！
    自从报纸上揭露了临近死亡的美帝国主义大量撒布细菌，妄图挽救它不可挽救的失败的消息以后，我们在华东、中南看到了亿万工人、农民、科学工作者、革命军人家属、学生们，对美帝国主义这一无耻罪行的愤怒和仇恨，听到了亿万人民共同的呼声：“坚决以实际行动支援前线，扑灭美帝国主义的细菌战！”
    无数人民都向我们表示：“决不容许美帝国主义再用细菌武器向人类逞凶！”我们到达杭州时，福华第一丝厂工人周水根说：“我在十三岁时，日本鬼子的飞机在衢州撒布鼠疫菌，我爸爸就这样死在日本强盗的手下！现在，美国强盗竟敢公然勾结日本细菌战犯石井四郎等进行惨无人道的细菌战，这是我坚决不能容忍的！我要以实际行动抗美援朝！”浙江省人民政府技工郑介安和王毓榛一九四零年曾在宁波、衢州看到当地和平人民遭受鼠疫的惨状，凡遭受日本细菌战毒害的，有的辗转病榻，有的全家染病，死后无人收殓。他们对这滔天罪行表示极大愤怒，他们说：“十二年来，浙江人民对此记忆犹新，美国强盗如今又大量撒布细菌，再次证明了它是我们的死敌。今天，我们有力量有决心来战胜美帝国主义的细菌战！”
    在广州，同样有千千万万的人民向我们表示反对细菌战的决心。越秀区吉祥街全体军属写信给我们说：“我们对美军这种惨无人道的疯狂行为，感到无比愤怒！我们已经写信给在朝鲜前线的儿女，鼓励他们歼灭更多的美国侵略军。我们誓以搞好家庭副业生产，为增强抗美援朝力量而努力。”中山大学细菌研究所主任李挺表示：“为了扑灭美国侵略者细菌战的毒焰，我们已准备好一切，祖国一有号召，立即奔赴前线，消灭毒菌，为中朝人民军队及和平居民服务。”武汉大学秘书长徐懋庸对我们说：“我们已经组成了反细菌战的组织，培养了大批的反细菌战干部，那里需要，我们就到那里去服务，为扑灭美国侵略者细菌战而努力！”中华医学会广州分会、长沙湘雅医院等医务工作者都已组成了反细菌战志愿防疫队，待命出发。
    到湖南省时，我们访问了中国人民领袖毛主席的故乡。该乡负责干部毛仁秋代表全乡农民激愤地对我们说：“请你转告彭德怀司令员、金日成将军和志愿军、人民军全体同志，我们决心以实际行动继续加强抗美援朝工作，支援中朝人民部队，彻底击垮美帝国主义的一切毒辣阴谋！”
    保卫着祖国国防的中国人民解放军同志们，也一致表示要学好现代军事技术，提高警惕，全力保卫祖国的安全和世界的和平。
    正在开展“三反”和“五反”运动的同志们，表示要肃清贪污分子和盗窃分子，做好增产节约，来支援我们！
    同志们！日本帝国主义使用过细菌武器，但没有能挽救它的失败；今天，美帝国主义也同样不能用细菌武器来挽救它的失败。站起来了的中国人民正继续以战斗的姿态组织防疫队，以苏联为首的民主国家人民正一致起来同情与援助我们，我们一定可以粉碎美国侵略者一切阴谋。同志们！努力吧！我们在朝鲜战场上曾经取得了一连串的胜利，今天，在抗击美国侵略者细菌战的战线上，我们必将获得更大的胜利！让我们继续以新的胜利来回答中国人民对我们的支援吧！
