Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd—In order to counter the U.S. imperialists’ provocative act of spreading bacteria in Korea with practical actions, medical workers in Tianjin and Chongqing have formed bacterial warfare defense organizations. The Tianjin Medical Workers' Aid Korea and Rescue Committee specially invited experts in biology, bacteriology, entomology, and public health to a meeting at the Public Health Bureau on the 2nd, and formed a "Special Committee for Bacterial Warfare Defense." Zhu Xianyi was elected as the chairman and Liu Pu as the vice-chairman on the spot. The committee's work is mainly divided into three aspects: bacterial testing, epidemic prevention, and propaganda and education. In order to raise citizens' awareness of the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes against humanity, the committee has decided to focus on propaganda and education work. The committee has now formed research, epidemic prevention, and propaganda and education groups, and has made preliminary discussions on specific work in the future.
    The Chongqing Health Workers Association and the Chongqing Branch of the Health Workers' Aid Korea Association jointly formed a "Bacterial Warfare Defense Committee" on the 1st, with Chen Wengui, a bacteriology expert and Deputy Minister of Health of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, as the chairman. The committee members include experts in parasitology, pathology, epidemiology, public health, surgery, and pharmacology. The "Bacterial Warfare Defense Committee" will conduct research on defense against various bacteria that the U.S. military may use; and will carry out mass-based publicity and education work related to bacteria.
    Health workers in Chongqing have also requested to go to Korea to stop the crimes of the American aggressor troops in bacterial warfare. As of the 3rd, more than 350 people have written to newspapers expressing their willingness to go to Korea. The Chongqing Health Workers Association has initiated a signature campaign for a volunteer aid Korea epidemic prevention work team.
