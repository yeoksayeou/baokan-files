    Thirteen: When she flew again after recovering from her illness, the vomiting stopped. The leadership then assigned a senior instructor to fly with her, helping her make up for missed lessons. Later, she was gradually able to fly independently. This event left a deep impression on her. She said: From this, I further realized the care and concern of the Party and the state for us. This is the inexhaustible strength and protection that enables us to increase our confidence, overcome difficulties, and master technology.
    Fourteen: In this way, they have traversed a glorious and arduous path.
    Now, they have not only initially mastered flying skills, but also can undertake aerial navigation, communications, mechanics, and ground maintenance work. On this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, a take-off ceremony was held in the capital. When the plane was preparing to take off, the women at the airport waved their arms with boundless excitement to congratulate the successful take-off of the plane piloted by the first group of female aviation personnel in New China.
    Fifteen: When the plane piloted by the female aviators flew over Tiananmen Square in the capital, people were delighted to see that the liberated women of New China have infinitely broad avenues to serve the motherland.

    十三、当她病好以后再飞行的时候，呕吐现象没有了。领导方面又派主任教员带她飞行，帮助她补上课目，后来她就慢慢地能够单独地飞行了。这件事留给她的印象很深。她说：我从此更体会到了党和国家对我们的关怀，这是使我们能够提高信心、克服困难、掌握技术的无穷力量和保护。
    十四、就这样，她们走过了一段光荣艰巨的道路。
    现在，她们不仅已经初步掌握了飞行技术，而且空中的领航、通讯、机械、地面的机务等工作也都能担当起来了。今年“三八”节的那一天，在首都举行了起飞典礼。当飞机准备起飞的时候，机场上的妇女们，以无限兴奋的情绪，挥舞着手臂来祝贺新中国第一批女航空人员驾驶的飞机胜利地起飞。
    十五、当由女航空员驾驶着的飞机，飞行在首都天安门上空的时候，人们喜悦地看到：解放了的新中国妇女，有着无限广阔的为祖国服务的道路。
