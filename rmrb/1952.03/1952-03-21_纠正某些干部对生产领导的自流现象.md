Correcting the Spontaneous Tendencies of Certain Cadres in Production Leadership

In the great “Three-Anti” movement, many cadres, technicians, and staff members of state-owned enterprises have been greatly tempered, and their political awareness and sense of responsibility have been greatly strengthened. However, some people have changed very little in this regard, and some have even developed another erroneous idea, adopting an irresponsible attitude towards production. They abandon their leadership responsibilities, fail to supervise and inspect production according to plan, fail to solve problems in production in a timely manner, and are timid and afraid of “making trouble.” As a result, labor discipline is relaxed, and production suffers. For example, the squad leader of the forging workshop of the Fushun Machine Repair Factory in Northeast China remained silent even when defective products were produced. The stalk-removing team of the tobacco blending workshop of the Harbin Cigarette Factory, which used to be a model team in the factory for implementing operating procedures, no longer implements operating procedures now. Certain cadres of the factory not only failed to persuade and correct these deviations, but instead adopted a compromising attitude.

Most of those who hold this attitude have an insufficient understanding of the “Three-Anti” movement, or have not actively participated in the movement. Seeing the masses' resentment towards bureaucracy and the intense fire of the struggle against bureaucrats, they are afraid of making mistakes and being criticized by the masses again. Therefore, they abandon their responsibilities and allow the work to suffer losses. In fact, this is another form of bureaucracy. This is very harmful to production. If this error is not thoroughly corrected, it will cause even greater losses to the cause of national construction. This is something the people will never allow.

    纠正某些干部对生产领导的自流现象
    在伟大的“三反”运动中，许多国营企业的干部、技术人员和职员，都受到了很大的锻炼，他们的政治觉悟和工作责任心大大加强了。但是，也有些人在这一方面改变得很少，有的甚至产生了另一种错误思想，对生产采取了不负责任的态度。他们放弃领导责任，不按照计划督促检查生产情况，不及时解决生产中的问题，畏首畏尾，唯恐“多事”。结果，使劳动纪律废弛，使生产受到损失。如：东北抚顺机器修理厂锻造车间的班长，眼看着出了废品，也不做声。哈尔滨制烟厂配烟车间抽梗组，过去是全厂执行操作规程的模范小组，现在也不执行操作规程了。该厂某些干部对于这些偏向，不但不进行说服，予以纠正，反而采取了迁就的态度。
    有这种态度的人，大多数是对“三反”运动认识不足，或者是没有主动地参加运动的。他们看到群众对官僚主义的愤恨，对官僚主义者斗争的火力十分猛烈，就怕犯错误，怕又受到群众批评，因此，就放弃了自己的责任，听任工作遭受损失。其实，这是官僚主义的另一种表现形式。这对生产的危害是很大的。如不彻底改正这种错误，将要给国家建设事业造成更大的损失。这是人民决不能容许的。
