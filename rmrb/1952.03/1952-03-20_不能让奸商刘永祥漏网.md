    We Must Not Let Profiteer Liu Yongxiang Escape!
    Editor: The profiteer Liu Yongxiang is the manager of the Yongming Construction Factory in Beijing. After the Japanese surrendered, he seized enemy assets and opened a construction company in Shenyang. After liberation, he hid Kuomintang military intelligence agents and raped a female accountant in the company. In the past year, Liu contracted six projects of various sizes in Beijing, from which he made exorbitant profits of more than 300 million yuan, accounting for more than 30 percent of the project costs. His methods of theft mainly involve underreporting, using inferior goods, raising prices, smuggling materials, and bribing cadres. He evaded taxes of more than 200 million yuan by using tricks such as expanding expenses and not recording funds. From January to May of last year, he colluded with Zhang Yingqi, the manager of Qiye Wood Factory, to illegally transport timber from Northeast China to Beijing and Tianjin, earning more than 70 million yuan. In order to fraudulently obtain a certificate of qualification for a second-level construction factory, he falsely reported the list of engineers and basic technical personnel to cope with the inspection by the Construction Bureau. When the anti-theft struggle began, this profiteer was summoned to Shenyang because he was reported. But he stubbornly refused to come clean and sent a fake confession and a letter of guarantee, attempting to deny his crimes. We must not let him escape justice.

    不能让奸商刘永祥漏网
    编辑同志：奸商刘永祥是北京永明营造厂的经理。他在日寇投降后，侵吞了敌产，在沈阳开设建筑公司。解放后，他曾隐藏国民党军统特务，强奸公司里女会计员。一年来，刘在北京承包了大小六个工程，从中获暴利三亿多元，占工程费百分之三十以上。他的盗窃方法，主要是以少报多、以次顶好、提高价格、偷运材料以及向干部行贿。他用扩大开支、款不入账等花样偷漏税款二亿多元。去年一月到五月，他勾结起业木厂经理张英起，从东北违法承运木材到北京天津，赚了七千多万元。他为了骗取二级营造厂的合格证，竟假报工程师及基本技术人员名单，以应付建设局的检验。在反盗窃斗争开始时，这个奸商因被人检举而被传到沈阳。但他执迷不悟，托人捎来假坦白书和具结书各一份，企图混赖自己的罪行。我们不能让他漏过网去。
