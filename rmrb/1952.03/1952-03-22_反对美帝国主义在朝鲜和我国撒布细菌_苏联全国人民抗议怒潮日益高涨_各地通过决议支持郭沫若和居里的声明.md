Xinhua News Agency, March 21st dispatch from Moscow, TASS: The rising tide of protest from people across the Soviet Union against the American aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons is growing ever stronger. At mass rallies everywhere, workers, engineers, and technicians from factories and institutions, scientists and students, and collective farmers have all expressed their boundless anger at the heinous crimes of the American aggressors in using bacteriological weapons.

At a general meeting of all staff members of the Moscow Second Ball Bearing Factory, Stakhanovite lathe operator Filkova said: What could be more vile and inhuman than the crimes of the American barbarians who are committing base atrocities? Like millions of honest people, we express our deep anger and demand an immediate end to germ warfare and that those who plan such wars be declared war criminals.

At a meeting at the Moscow "Ilyich Factory," Chernikov, director of the forging and casting department, said: The American imperialists are now engaging in unprecedentedly vile behavior. Their crimes have surpassed the bloody atrocities of Hitlerite fascism. We demand an immediate end to this unheard-of brutality.

The working people of Leningrad have expressed fierce protests against the recent crimes of the American aggressors. Metallurgical workers at the Stalin Factory held a meeting on March 18th in the spacious hydraulic turbine workshop. Stalin Prize winner and head of the design office, Engineer Romakin, said: American devils are dropping bombs containing plague, cholera, typhoid, and other germs on cities and villages in Korea and Northeast China. These enemies of mankind, these modern cannibals, are already calculating their profits. They shamelessly boast that plague, cholera, or typhoid are cheaper than other weapons, and that if the men and women on the other side all get sick and die, then their factories can fall intact into the hands of the victors. Romakin said: The workers of our factory, named after the great standard-bearer of peace, Comrade Stalin, like all the Soviet people, feel boundless anger at the heinous crimes of the American aggressors. We demand an immediate end to germ warfare and the cessation of American aggression against Korea.

The "Race Walker" factory, the Molotov factory, and other enterprises in Leningrad also held meetings, and the speakers at the meetings all expressed extreme anger.

At a meeting of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Academician of the Academy of Sciences, member of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council, and famous writer Kornechuk said: The American lunatics have embarked on an unprecedentedly sinful path—using bacteriological weapons against the Korean and Chinese people. In doing so, they have finally exposed themselves as the mortal enemies of mankind. We express our deep anger and condemn the instigators, planners, and perpetrators of these heinous crimes.

Academician Kavetsky, Director of the Institute of Biology of the Ukrainian Republic Academy of Sciences, said: Advanced medical workers have been focusing their efforts on studying ways to eliminate diseases and have often shown heroism and self-sacrifice. The famous Russian scientist and founder of microbiology, Mechnikov, in order to test whether his method of preventing and treating cholera was harmless to the human body and to test the effectiveness of the method, once personally swallowed a pure culture of cholera bacilli. The late President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Zabolotny, personally led an epidemic prevention team to India to assist the local people in fighting the rampant plague. The new research and achievements made by Soviet scientists for the benefit of the people have enriched science. But, at the same time, the American imperialists are using the achievements of science to exterminate people on a large scale. For these crimes, not only the American government and American generals and officers must be held responsible, but also the American quack scientists.

Miners in the Karaganda coal region of the Kazakh Republic also angrily protested the heinous crimes of the American devils in using bacteriological weapons. A mass meeting was held at the Zhdanov Mine, the largest in the Karaganda coal region. Skakov, a Kazakh loader, said: Soviet miners express boundless anger at the inhuman acts of the American aggressors in using plague-carrying flies and typhoid-carrying lice to kill peaceful residents in Korea and Northeast China. The congress unanimously passed a resolution, representing millions of miners, demanding an immediate cessation of germ warfare.

Various protest rallies have also been held in cities and villages throughout Uzbekistan. A staff meeting of more than 1,000 people was held at the agricultural machinery factory in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. Uzbek assembler Shabukhanov said: The American bandits cannot escape responsibility for the unprecedented crimes they have committed in Korea and Northeast China. No matter how mad the aggressors are, they will absolutely not be able to thwart the will of the people fighting for peace. The forces of peace and democracy are great. This force is growing stronger and stronger every day and will undoubtedly stop the evil schemes of the American imperialists.

At a rally at a refinery in Baku, the capital of the Azerbaijan Republic, Engineer Mamedov said: The people of the world will one day punish these mad aggressors who dare to use terrible weapons of mass destruction against mankind. We unanimously support the statement by World Peace Council Chairman Joliot-Curie calling on the people of the world to express fierce protest against the new crimes of the American warmongers.

A protest rally was held in Stalinabad, the capital of the Tajik Republic. Aliyev, Director of the Tajik Agricultural Research Institute, Akhadova, foreman of the Stalinabad Textile Factory, teacher Abasina, and poet Mirshakar successively spoke, demanding that these American criminals, who seriously violate human conscience and all standards of international law, be brought to the people's court for trial. All attendees unanimously supported this view.

The working people of the Soviet Baltic republics also expressed anger at the crimes of the American war criminals. A rally was held at the Riga Automatic Electrical Instrument Factory. Stakhanovite assembler Osis said at the meeting: The working people of Latvia have personally suffered from the atrocities of Hitlerite fascism. The crimes of the German fascist aggressors at that time seemed to have reached the extreme of barbarity. However, the American aggressors have now surpassed the Hitlerite bandits. The heart of every honest man and woman is burning with indescribable anger. The American murderers will not escape their responsibility!

The working people throughout the Moldavian Republic have held rallies to condemn the atrocities of the American aggressors.

The rallies in various regions unanimously adopted resolutions supporting the two statements by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, and Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, calling on the people of all countries in the world to express angry protest against the atrocities of the American aggressors and to stop the use of bacteriological weapons for the benefit of all mankind.

    反对美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国撒布细菌
    苏联全国人民抗议怒潮日益高涨
    各地通过决议支持郭沫若和居里的声明
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联全国各地人民抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器的怒潮，正在愈来愈高涨。在各地的群众大会上，工厂和机关的工作人员、工程师和技术人员、科学家和学生、集体农民，对美国侵略者使用细菌武器的滔天罪行都一致表示无比的愤怒。
    在莫斯科第二球轴承制造厂的全体工作人员大会上，斯塔哈诺夫式镟工菲尔科瓦说：美国野蛮人在干着卑劣的暴行，还有什么能比他们的罪行更加龌龊和不人道的呢？我们跟千千万万正直的人民一样表示我们深切的愤怒，要求马上制止细菌战争，并把筹划这种战争的人宣布为战犯。
    在莫斯科“伊里奇工厂”的会议上，锻铸部主任契尔尼科夫说：美帝国主义者现在正干着空前卑劣的行为。他们的罪行已经超过了希特勒法西斯主义的血腥暴行。我们要求马上制止这种闻所未闻的残暴行为。
    列宁格勒劳动人民对美国侵略者最近的罪行表示激烈的抗议。斯大林工厂的冶金工人于三月十八日在宽敞的水力透平车间内举行了集会。斯大林奖金得奖人、设计处主任罗马金工程师说：美国恶魔们正在对朝鲜和中国东北的城市和乡村投下带有鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒及其他病菌的炸弹。这些人类的敌人、这些现代的食人生番已经在计算他们的利润了。他们无耻地吹嘘说，鼠疫、霍乱或伤寒比其他的武器便宜，假如对方的男男女女都得病死掉，那么他们的工厂便可完好地落到战胜者手里。罗马金说：我们以伟大的和平旗手斯大林同志的名字命名的工厂的工人，和全体苏联人民一样，对美国侵略者的滔天罪行感到无比的愤怒。我们要求马上制止细菌战争，停止美国对朝鲜的侵略。
    列宁格勒的“竞走者”工厂、莫洛托夫工厂和其他企业也都举行了集会，人们在会上的发言都一致表示极度的愤怒。
    在乌克兰科学院的一次会议上，科学院院士、世界和平理事会执行局委员、名作家考涅楚克说：美国的疯子们已经走上了空前的罪恶的道路——对朝鲜和中国人民使用细菌武器。他们这样就最后暴露了他们原来是人类的死敌。我们表示我们深切的愤怒，并斥责这些滔天罪行的鼓动者、策划者和执行者。
    乌克兰共和国科学院生物研究所所长卡维茨基院士说：先进的医学工作者一直在集中精力研究消灭疾病的办法，并常常表现了英雄主义和自我牺牲的精神。俄罗斯著名的科学家、微生物学的创始者麦奇尼科夫为了试验他的防治霍乱的方法是否对人体无害和试验这方法的效力，曾经亲自吞服霍乱杆菌的纯粹培养物。已故乌克兰科学院院长查波洛特尼曾亲率防疫队到印度，协助当地人民扑灭当地猖狂流行的鼠疫。苏联科学家为了人民的福利而进行的新的研究和所取得的新的成就，使科学丰富了起来。但是，就在同时，美帝国主义者却利用科学的成就来大规模地绝灭人民。对于这些罪行，不单美国政府和美国将领军官要负责任，就是美国的冒牌科学家也要负责任。
    哈萨克共和国卡拉干达煤区的矿工们也愤怒地抗议美国恶魔使用细菌武器的滔天罪行。卡拉干达煤区规模最大的日丹诺夫矿举行了大会，哈萨克族的装卸工人斯卡科夫说：苏联矿工对于美国侵略者使用带有鼠疫的苍蝇和带有伤寒的虱子杀害朝鲜和中国东北和平居民的不人道行为，表示无比的愤怒。大会一致通过决议，代表千千万万的矿工，要求马上停止细菌战争。
    乌兹别克各地的城市和乡村也纷纷举行各种抗议集会。乌兹别克首都塔什干的农业机器制造厂举行了一千多人的职工大会。乌兹别克族的装配工沙布哈诺夫说：美国匪徒们逃避不了他们在朝鲜和中国东北所犯下的空前罪行的责任。侵略者们无论怎样疯狂，绝对挫折不了为和平而斗争的人民的意志。和平民主的力量是伟大的。这力量正在一天天地增长壮大，无疑地一定会制止美帝国主义者的罪恶阴谋。
    在阿塞拜疆共和国首都巴库的炼油厂的一个集会上，工程师马麦多夫说：世界人民终有一天要惩办这些敢于使用大规模灭绝人类的恐怖武器的疯狂侵略者。我们一致支持世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里号召全世界人民对美国战争贩子的新罪行表示激烈抗议的声明。
    塔吉克共和国首都斯大林纳巴德举行了抗议大会。塔吉克农业研究所所长阿里耶夫、斯大林纳巴德纺织厂领班阿哈多瓦、教师阿巴辛娜和诗人米尔沙卡尔相继发言，要求把这些严重地违反人类良知和国际法一切标准的美国罪犯交付人民法庭审判。全体到会者一致支持这个意见。
    苏联波罗的海沿岸各共和国的劳动人民也对美国战犯的罪行表示愤怒。里加自动电工仪器厂举行了集会，斯塔哈诺夫式装配工奥西斯在会上说：拉脱维亚劳动人民曾亲自受过希特勒法西斯主义暴行的痛苦。德国法西斯侵略者当时的罪行，似乎已经野蛮到了极点。但是，美国侵略者现在竟超过了希特勒匪徒。每一个正直的男女的内心都燃烧着言语难以形容的怒火。美国杀人犯逃脱不了他们的责任！
    摩尔达维亚共和国全国各地的劳动人民纷纷举行集会，谴责美国侵略者的暴行。
    各地的集会都一致通过决议，支持中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若和世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里号召全世界各国人民对美国侵略者的暴行表示愤怒抗议、并为全人类的利益制止使用细菌武器的两个声明。
