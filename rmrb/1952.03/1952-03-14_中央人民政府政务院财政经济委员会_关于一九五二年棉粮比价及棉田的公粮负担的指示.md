The national cotton production in 1951 exceeded the planned target and achieved great success. This year's task is to maintain the national cotton planting area at the 1951 level and to complete the 1952 grain production increase plan, so as to increase the yield per unit area of cotton and grain fields. To this end, the cotton-grain price ratio and the public grain burden on cotton fields in 1952 are hereby stipulated as follows:

I. Cotton-Grain Price Ratio for 1952

Region					Grain Type		Quantity of Grain Exchanged per Jin of 7-8 Inch Medium Grade Lint Cotton
Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong		Millet			8-9 Jin
Shanxi	Jinzhong			Millet			8.5-9.5 Jin
	Jinnan			Wheat			7.5-8.5 Jin
Shaanxi, Henan			Wheat			7.5-8.5 Jin
Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan		Medium-Season Rice	8-9 Jin
Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Southern Anhui, Zhejiang	Medium Indica Rice	8-9 Jin
Southwest, Northeast			Self-Determined		Self-Determined

Appendix: 1. Millet prices in millet areas should be calculated according to local rice prices, and new rice prices should be used after December 1st.
	  2. Medium-season rice is equivalent to twice-milled Indica rice.

II. The above price ratio is the price at which state-owned trading companies and cooperatives purchase cotton from farmers and sell grain, which is also the actual price farmers receive for selling cotton. This should be maintained within this range regardless of the season. As for the grain prices in adjacent areas, such as the adjacent areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Pingyuan, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government should adjust them at any time to ensure the balance of cotton prices.

III. The Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government shall uniformly stipulate cotton prices in various places and ensure the implementation of the price ratio. Cooperatives should, under the assistance of state-owned trading companies, carry out pre-purchase and credit purchase work based on the state's cotton and grain production and purchase situation. When cooperatives pre-purchase cotton, agricultural departments at all levels should assist in mobilizing farmers to sign contracts. In areas where the strength of trade departments and cooperatives is insufficient, people's governments at all levels must assist state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in every possible way to ensure the implementation of the above price ratio.

IV. Implement the policy of "superior grade, superior price; inferior grade, inferior price," improve grading and inspection techniques, and give fair and reasonable prices according to grade. It is strictly forbidden to suppress grades and prices. The difference between lint cotton and seed cotton, as well as the method of purchasing improved seed cotton at a premium, shall continue to be implemented in accordance with the joint instructions issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government in 1950.

V. In order to appropriately balance the proportion of public grain burden between grain fields and cotton fields, and to maintain the cotton planting area, the following regulations are hereby made regarding the public grain burden on cotton fields: In areas where the average proportion of public grain burden on cotton fields in the past accounted for more than 11% of the cotton field's expected output (for example, if each mu of cotton field should produce 30 jin of lint cotton, the burden is 3.3 jin), the burden method shall remain unchanged; in areas where the average proportion of public grain burden on cotton fields in the past was less than 11% of the cotton field's expected output, the average proportion of public grain burden on local cotton fields should be increased to 11%. The specific methods shall be formulated by the people's governments (military and administrative committees) of major administrative regions in accordance with the above principles, with reference to the situation in their respective regions, and shall be implemented after being submitted to this committee for approval.

All relevant departments must earnestly guarantee the implementation of the above regulations, and conduct in-depth publicity to the peasants, raise the enthusiasm of peasants to increase grain and cotton production, and ensure the completion of grain planting and cotton planting tasks.

    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会
    关于一九五二年棉粮比价及棉田的公粮负担的指示
    一九五一年全国棉花生产，已超计划完成任务，成绩甚好。今年的任务是既要保持一九五一年全国棉田种植面积水平，又要完成一九五二年的粮食增产计划，以提高棉田和粮田的单位面积产量。为此，特将一九五二年的棉粮比价及棉田的公粮负担规定如下：
    一、一九五二年的棉粮比价
    地           区   粮食种类    每斤7—8吋中级皮棉换粮数量
    河北、平原、山东  小米        八—九斤
    山西  晋中        小米        八·五—九·五斤
          晋南        小麦        七·五—八·五斤
    陕西、河南        小麦        七·五—八·五斤
    湖北、江西、湖南  中熟米      八—九斤
    苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南、浙江  中籼米  八—九斤
    西南、东北        自行规定    自行规定
    附注：1，小米区米价按当地米价计算，十二月一日后按新米价计算。
    2，中熟米相当于籼稻二机米。
    二、上述比价是国营贸易公司和合作社向农民收购棉花出售粮食的价格，亦即农民售棉所得的实际价格，不论任何季节，均应保持在此幅度之内。至于各个接壤地区的粮价，例如河北、山东、平原接壤地区的粮价，应由中央人民政府贸易部随时调节，保证棉价的平衡。
    三、各地棉价由中央人民政府贸易部统一规定并保证比价的执行。合作社应根据国家棉粮的生产和收购情况，在国营贸易公司协助下，进行预购和赊购工作。在合作社预购棉花时，各级农业部门应协助动员农民进行订立合同的工作。在贸易部门和合作社力量不足的地区，各级人民政府必须协助国营贸易公司及合作社用一切办法保证上述比价的贯彻执行。四、实行“优级优价、低级低价”的政策，提高分级检验技术，公平合理地按级给价，严禁压级压价。皮棉籽棉差价以及良种籽棉加价收购办法，仍按一九五零年中央人民政府农业、贸易两部联合指示执行。五、为了适当平衡粮田棉田的公粮负担比例，为了保持植棉面积，特规定棉田的公粮负担办法如下：凡过去棉田的公粮负担占棉田应产量的平均比例在百分之十一（例如每亩棉田应产皮棉三十斤，负担三点三斤）以上的地区，其负担办法照旧不变；过去棉田的公粮负担占棉田应产量的平均比例不及百分之十一的地区，应把当地棉田的公粮负担的平均比例提高到百分之十一。具体办法由各大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）根据上述原则，参照本区情况拟订，报本委批准后施行。
    以上规定，各有关部门必须切实保证执行，并向农民深入宣传，提高农民增产粮棉的积极性，保证种粮和植棉任务的完成。
    主任  陈云  一九五二年三月十二日
