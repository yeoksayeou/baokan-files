The per unit area yield exceeds 1943 by more than eight percent, and the cooperative and mutual aid economy has become the main body of the rural economy.

After four years of the great production movement following land reform in Heilongjiang Province, especially after the patriotic bumper harvest movement in 1951, the rural landscape has undergone significant changes. The current basic situation in the countryside is:

First, agricultural and sideline production has generally recovered and developed throughout the province, except for disaster areas. The per unit area yield has generally exceeded the pre-liberation level, and many new records for individual, mutual aid group, and village-wide bumper harvests have been created. The individual who created the highest bumper harvest record for wheat is Zhang Cai, a farmer from Qinggang County, with an average yield of 7,575 jin per hectare (one hectare equals fifteen Chinese mu). The highest bumper harvest record for soybeans was created by Wang Shun, a farmer from Nehe County, with an average yield of 7,200 jin per hectare. The highest bumper harvest record for corn was created by Zhao Guangtian, a farmer from Nehe County, with an average yield of 12,214 jin per hectare. The highest bumper harvest record for sorghum was created by Xing Gui, a farmer from Baiquan County, with an average yield of 7,220 jin per hectare. These bumper harvest records are all more than twice the local average yield. Mutual aid groups that created new bumper harvest records include: the Ma Qingfu mutual aid group in Nehe County, which planted 81 hectares of newly reclaimed wheat land and averaged more than seven shi (3,500 jin) per hectare; the Meng Qingyu mutual aid group in Hailun County, which planted 89.51 hectares of wheat with an average yield of 5.06 shi per hectare, soybeans with an average yield of 7.34 shi per hectare, sorghum with an average yield of 9.23 shi per hectare, millet with an average yield of 7.73 shi per hectare, and corn with an average yield of 13.8 shi per hectare, totaling an average yield of 8.55 shi of raw grain per hectare, approximately 4,120 jin; the Zhu Qingshan mutual aid group in Hailun County, with an average yield of 9 shi of raw grain per hectare, approximately 4,230 jin, exceeding the normal standard yield by more than 1,000 jin. These are all examples of collective creation of bumper harvest records on large plots of land. This year, the province has 4 million hectares of cultivated land. Subtracting more than 300,000 hectares for vegetable and industrial raw material land, and 600,000 hectares of disaster-stricken land, the province still produced more than 3.9 million tons of grain. The province's cultivated land area and total output both reached 90 percent of the 1943 level; the average yield per hectare reached 2,435 jin, exceeding the 1943 yield of 2,252 jin per hectare by more than eight percent.

Second, with the development of the rural economy, the lives of the vast majority of farmers have generally improved, and middle peasants have become the majority of farmers and the main force in rural production. According to a survey of six villages in Hailun, Keshan, and Nehe counties, before land reform, the original middle peasants accounted for only 17.1 percent of the total number of rural households. Now, middle peasants and prosperous middle peasants account for 64.1 percent of the total number of households. They own 76.8 percent of the cultivated land, 86.2 percent of the draft animals, 87.4 percent of the carts, and 88.3 percent of the farm tools. Middle peasants, especially prosperous middle peasants, generally have two or three horses and surplus grain and capital, but feel that labor and land are insufficient; they actively demand expanded reproduction. This is the main force for further improving agricultural productivity. However, according to the survey of the above six villages, 30.6 percent of farmers are still at the living standards of poor peasants, including 3.6 percent of hired laborers. Although the economic conditions of this part of the farmers have improved significantly since land reform, they still have great difficulties in production and life. They have surplus labor, but lack draft animals and production funds, and some even have debts. They urgently demand expanded production.

Third, the planting of commercial grain and industrial raw materials in rural areas has been further developed, which is a central link for further developing agricultural production and increasing farmers' purchasing power. Farmers sold 1.15 million tons of commercial grain in 1950 (from the fourth quarter of 1949 to the third quarter of 1950, the following is calculated in the same way), 1.35 million tons in 1951, and will reach 1.46 million tons in 1952. In 1950, farmers sold native and sideline products equivalent to 920,000 tons of grain, and in 1951 it reached 1.6 million tons. The cultivated area of ​​soybean and wheat commercial crops was 820,000 hectares in 1949 and reached 1.19 million hectares in 1951; the output increased from 580,000 tons in 1949 to 1.04 million tons in 1951. According to surveys of Yong'an Village and Yaofangshen Village in Hailun, farmers' purchasing power increased by 42.7 percent in 1951 compared with 1950. The main reason for the increase in farmers' purchasing power is the development of the rural commodity economy.

Fourth, the rural cooperative and mutual aid economy has become the main body of the rural economic form. Various types of labor mutual aid groups account for 72.5 percent of the total number of farm households (there are more than 150,000 mutual aid groups in the province, with more than 689,000 farm households participating), accounting for 82.9 percent of the total rural labor force; individual farmers account for about 27 percent of the households (mainly middle peasants); new rich peasants have emerged, and in some areas have even developed to some extent. According to the survey of the above six villages, new rich peasants account for 0.4 percent of the households.

Based on the above situation and the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the basic tasks of Heilongjiang Province in rural work and agricultural production in the future should be: to concentrate efforts on increasing the yield per unit area, gradually expand the area of ​​reclamation in areas where conditions permit, appropriately develop the planting of commercial grain, and further commercialize farmers' surplus grain, in order to promote the rapid rise of farmers' economic life, make the existing middle peasants richer, enable the existing poor peasants to quickly catch up with the living standards of middle peasants, and enable a small number of farmers to avoid decline and poverty. To this end, we must continue to implement the方針 of organization, labor production, and common prosperity, further develop and consolidate farmers' cooperative and mutual aid organizations, and expand agricultural reproduction.

The development of the cooperative and mutual aid movement is extremely uneven, and the farmers' demand for expanding reproduction cannot be met.

The labor mutual aid in Heilongjiang Province in 1951, with the development of the patriotic bumper harvest movement, coupled with the training of mutual aid group leaders, has been further consolidated and developed compared with 1950. During spring plowing and summer hoeing, 51,619 mutual aid groups in the province (accounting for 34.2 percent of the total number of mutual aid groups in the province) formulated patriotic bumper harvest plans, and another 26,671 groups (accounting for 17 percent of the total number of mutual aid groups in the province) formulated patriotic pacts and carried out competitions. Therefore, the phenomenon of "spring planting, summer scattering, and autumn collapse" in the past has been changed, so that labor mutual aid has made new developments in improving technology, increasing the yield per unit area, mobilizing women and semi-laborers to participate in production, combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and combining production and supply and marketing; more importantly, patriotic ideological education has been carried out in most mutual aid groups.

However, the development of labor mutual aid is still extremely uneven, and the dominant position of the cooperative and mutual aid economy is not consolidated enough in many rural areas.

In advanced villages with better work, the mutual aid movement has been gradually consolidated, improved, and expanded due to strong leadership. In these villages, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members take the lead in participating in mutual aid groups, and there are good labor model mutual aid groups as examples; mutual aid groups have improved technology internally, combined sideline production, produced more grain, and increased income, thus solving the problem of farmers expanding reproduction, and farmers have obtained greater practical benefits in mutual aid. In this type of village, the superiority of being organized has been fully demonstrated. The vast majority of middle peasants and prosperous middle peasants have joined mutual aid groups, and general farmers admire and tend to be organized. However, this type of village is still a minority. In general villages, especially in villages with relatively backward work, because the leading organs relax their leadership over the cooperative and mutual aid movement, some party members hire long-term workers and work individually, and there is a lack of good mutual aid groups as examples. The production content of general mutual aid groups is not substantial, and they cannot smoothly expand reproduction. Farmers cannot get more practical benefits in mutual aid groups. In villages with relatively backward work, most of the middle peasants and prosperous middle peasants (who have two or three horses and can farm independently) work individually, new rich peasants have emerged, and the banner of developing production is in the hands of rich peasants and individual households. Farmers admire individual households and rich peasants, and the cooperative and mutual aid movement is gradually declining, and temporary mutual aid groups are increasing day by day.

Judging from the proportion of various types of mutual aid groups, it can also be seen that the development of the cooperative and mutual aid movement is very uneven. The organizational forms of cooperative and mutual aid in Heilongjiang Province can be divided into four types:

The first type is temporary mutual aid groups. These groups are horse sharing and people temporary exchange labor in spring, which is a small and low-level form. The number of such groups is very large, accounting for about 30 to 40 percent of the total number of households organized in the province; there are more such mutual aid groups in backward villages.

The second type is seasonal mutual aid groups. In agriculture, they share horses and exchange labor in the three major seasons, and engage in sideline production individually. This mutual aid organization can solve the problems of intensive farming and cooperative reclamation in agricultural production, but it cannot completely solve the problem of expanding reproduction. This type of mutual aid group is the main form of cooperative and mutual aid in rural areas throughout the province today, accounting for about 40 to 50 percent of the total number of households organized. There are more such groups in general villages.

The third type is permanent mutual aid groups that combine agriculture and sideline occupations. This type of mutual aid group has production plans, combines agriculture and sideline occupations, and pays attention to improving technology. Generally, there is a division of labor in technology, and a small number of them have implemented division of labor and industry. Some of them already have some public farm tools and livestock or public accumulation funds. This type of mutual aid group is generally larger and can initially solve the problem of farmers expanding reproduction. There are more such mutual aid groups in villages with a foundation for cooperative and mutual aid movements and with labor models, accounting for about 15 to 20 percent of the total number of households organized.

The fourth type is partnership groups that implement land, labor, and livestock shares, and agricultural production cooperatives that are characterized by the use of new-style horse-drawn farm tools and carry out collective production by breaking land boundaries. Partnership groups are most numerous in areas close to Inner Mongolia. Because this area is mostly sandy land, and is often attacked by wind and drought disasters, the yield is very high in mutual aid regardless of whether the crops are planted early or late. In order to avoid personal disasters, farmers spontaneously organized partnership groups to plant, harvest, and distribute together. These groups are all small (two or three households to five or six households in a group) and not very fixed (changing once a year). The vast majority of them only carry out production cooperation in the three major agricultural seasons, do not combine agriculture and sideline occupations, and have very poor technological improvements. Therefore, most of these groups cannot solve the problem of farmers expanding reproduction. There are about 200 such groups in the province. Agricultural production cooperatives are the highest level of cooperative and mutual aid organizations. Households within the cooperative have broken land boundaries between households, use Soviet-style new horse-drawn farm tools for cultivation, implement agriculture and sideline occupation combinations, divide labor and industry, have unified production plans, plant according to the land, and can more reasonably allocate labor and improve labor efficiency. This type of organization can better solve the problem of farmers expanding reproduction, and is a transitional form to guide farmers towards socialist collectivization. There are currently only four such agricultural production cooperatives in the province.

The guiding principles for developing and consolidating cooperative and mutual aid organizations and several issues that should be paid attention to

Based on the above situation, the guiding principles for labor mutual aid in Heilongjiang Province in the future should be: (1) In backward villages with a poor foundation for mutual aid, vigorously develop the first type of cooperative and mutual aid organizations, and raise the first type of groups to the second type of groups; we must also focus on cultivating permanent mutual aid groups as examples for the first and second types of groups. We must correct the erroneous attitude of some cadres who believe that temporary horse sharing and labor exchange are not called mutual aid, and thus adopt an attitude of exclusion and abandonment of leadership. (2) In general villages, we should lead the large-scale development and improvement of the second type of mutual aid groups. (3) In advanced villages with a better foundation for mutual aid, we should actively develop and promote the third type of mutual aid groups under leadership.

(4) We should strengthen the leadership of partnership groups, and strive to gradually combine most of them with sideline occupations and technological improvements to achieve permanent cooperative and mutual aid; individual ones with conditions can be appropriately expanded, loaned new farm tools, and raised to agricultural production cooperatives. We should focus on establishing technology promotion stations based on new-style horse-drawn farm tools, and develop agricultural production cooperatives under leadership and with a focus around the technology promotion stations.

In order to further consolidate, improve, and develop labor mutual aid organizations, attention should be paid to solving the following issues:

First, the key to further consolidating and improving labor mutual aid at present is: on the one hand, to solve the problem of middle peasants demanding to expand reproduction, and on the other hand, to solve the problem of poor peasants demanding rapid economic rise. To this end, we must guide households with horses and households without horses, households with capital and households without capital to organize together, that is, to combine the surplus capital and livestock of middle peasants with the surplus labor of poor peasants, in order to carry out expanded reproduction. To this end, we must rationally organize the funds of mutual aid groups under leadership, cooperate in purchasing new-style farm tools, cooperate in reclaiming wasteland, cooperate in purchasing rubber-tired carts to develop the transportation industry, cooperate in developing sideline occupations and handicrafts, or cooperate in building water conservancy projects and organizing livestock cooperatives to develop animal husbandry, etc. In short, relying solely on agriculture cannot solve the farmers' demand for expanding reproduction. Only by increasing the wealth of mutual aid groups from many aspects, producing more grain, can the mutual aid cooperation movement be consolidated and developed. Therefore, some mutual aid groups with a better foundation should be appropriately expanded and gradually move towards division of labor and industry. In addition, we must also plan to integrate mutual aid groups with rural credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives.

Second, guide mutual aid groups to summarize and promote the experience of the patriotic bumper harvest movement and new bumper harvest records, and universally reward farmers and mutual aid groups that create new bumper harvest records. Each county, district, and village should select the highest standards for new bumper harvest records for various crops, spread bumper harvest experience, and call on everyone to learn. At the same time, we should call on every good mutual aid group to use a certain amount of land to carry out intensive farming, improve technology, and create new bumper harvest records for various crops.

Third, implement the policy of equal value and mutual benefit in labor exchange and mutual aid. At present, middle peasants occupy a dominant position in the rural political economy, and the phenomenon of excluding poor households and households without horses (poor peasants) has occurred in mutual aid groups. For example, the wage for horse labor is high and the wage for manual labor is low. In cooperative reclamation, the phenomenon of labor and livestock being equally divided (some even taking livestock as the main factor) in dividing wasteland and distributing grain is quite common. In this way, livestock profits are too high. Investing a horse in reclamation in the spring can earn back a horse in the fall; while labor is reduced to an auxiliary position in production. This is unreasonable. In the future, under the principle of not making households with horses suffer losses, we should lead and appropriately gradually reduce the wage for horse labor. In cooperative reclamation, land and grain should be distributed according to labor, and livestock should be given rent or wages.

Fourth, it has been discovered that mutual aid groups collectively hire long-term workers, and new rich peasants and prosperous middle peasants bring long-term workers to participate in mutual aid groups. This is a direction of the rich peasant economy. In the future, this kind of exploitation form of collective hiring of long-term workers or bringing long-term workers to participate in mutual aid groups should not be allowed within mutual aid groups.

Fifth, we must strengthen the party's leadership over the mutual aid movement. At present, there are a small number of party cadres and party members in rural areas who adopt an attitude of indifference to the mutual aid movement. Some hire long-term workers to cultivate, and some work individually. For example, in Keshan County, among party cadres who hire long-term workers, there are nine branch secretaries and twenty-three village heads. Forty-seven party members hire long-term workers, accounting for 4.3 percent of the total number of party members in the county; 200 party members work individually, accounting for 11 percent of the party members in the county. In Zhaodong County, party members who hire long-term workers account for 3 percent, and those who work individually account for 15.5 percent. Among the 354 party members in the fourth district of this county, 49 hire long-term workers, accounting for 13.9 percent. Among the 384 party members in the fourteenth district, only 47 participate in labor mutual aid. This tendency of developing towards a capitalist economy seriously hinders the development of the mutual aid cooperation movement. In addition, last year, the leadership of the mutual aid movement in some areas still had a serious tendency to let things take their own course. This tendency gradually diminished the mutual aid movement. Therefore, county and district party committees and rural branches must strengthen the political leadership and ideological education of mutual aid groups; first of all, they must strengthen the ideological education of party members, so that they understand that party members are not allowed to hire workers, and it is wrong to work individually. Party members should actively participate in various types of mutual aid groups, and persuade individual farmers to participate in cooperative mutual aid, and lead farmers to advance in the direction of agricultural collectivization.

Sixth, county and district party committees should convene representative meetings of mutual aid groups on a quarterly basis to summarize and exchange experiences, train and cultivate mutual aid group backbones, and pay attention to improving the democratic management system within the groups.

Seventh, advocate the combination of state-owned farms and mutual aid groups. State-owned farms should provide guidance and assistance to the surrounding mutual aid groups in technology, train mutual aid group technical cadres centered on the farms, and can sign contract farming contracts with mutual aid groups using Soviet-style horse-drawn farm tools and tractors. At the same time, each county should plan to organize farmers to visit state-owned farms to educate farmers with the superiority of mechanized large-scale production of state-owned farms. The tendency of state-owned farms to separate from the masses and produce in isolation must be corrected.

    黑龙江省农村生产的新情况和合作互助运动中的几个问题
    中共黑龙江省委办公室主任　张士英
    单位面积产量超过一九四三年百分之八强，合作互助经济已成为农村经济中的主体
    黑龙江省经过土地改革后四年来的大生产运动，特别是经过一九五一年的爱国主义丰产运动，农村面貌已起了很大变化。目前农村的基本情况是：
    第一、全省除灾区外，农业副业生产已普遍地恢复和发展，单位面积产量已普遍超过解放前的水平，并且创造了许多个人的、互助组的和全村的丰产新纪录。个人创造小麦最高丰产新纪录的有青冈县农民张才，每垧地（一垧等于十五市亩）平均产七千五百七十五斤；大豆的最高丰产新纪录有讷河县农民王顺，每垧地平均产七千二百斤；玉米的最高丰产新纪录有讷河县农民赵广田，每垧平均产一万二千二百十四斤；高粱的最高丰产新纪录有拜泉县农民邢贵，每垧平均产七千二百二十斤。这些丰产新纪录，都超过当地一般产量的两倍以上。互助组创造丰产新纪录的有：讷河县马庆福互助组，种八十一垧新荒地小麦，平均每垧打七石（合三千五百斤）以上；海伦县孟庆余互助组，全组种八十九点五一垧小麦，平均每垧打五点零六石，大豆平均每垧打七点三四石，高粱平均每垧打九点二三石，谷子每垧平均打七点七三石，玉米每垧平均打十三点八石，总计全组平均每垧产原粮八点五五石，约合四千一百二十斤；海伦县朱清山互助组，全组平均每垧产原粮九石，约合四千二百三十斤，超过常年标准产量一千多斤。这些都是在大块土地上集体创造丰产新纪录的范例。全省今年耕地四百万垧，除种菜和工业原料地三十多万垧，受灾地六十万垧外，全省仍打粮三百九十多万吨。全省的耕地面积和总产量都达到一九四三年水平的百分之九十；常年平均每垧产量已达到二千四百三十五斤，超过一九四三年每垧产量二千二百五十二斤的百分之八强。
    第二、随着农村经济的发展，广大农民的生活已普遍上升，中农已成为农民的多数和农村生产的主力军。根据海伦、克山、讷河三县六个村的调查，土地改革前原有中农仅占农村总户数的百分之十七点一，现在中农和富裕中农已占总户数的百分之六十四点一。他们占有耕地百分之七十六点八，占有耕畜百分之八十六点二，占有大车百分之八十七点四，占有农具百分之八十八点三。中农，特别是富裕中农，一般都有两三匹马，并有余粮余资，但感到劳力、土地不足；他们积极要求扩大再生产。这是进一步提高农业生产力的主要力量。但据以上六个村调查，仍有百分之三十点六的农民现在还处在贫农生活水平，其中有雇农百分之三点六。这一部分农民在经济上虽比土地改革时显著上升，但在生产和生活上仍有很大困难。他们劳力有余，但缺乏畜力和生产资金，有的甚至欠有债务。他们迫切要求扩大生产。
    第三、农村商品粮和工业原料的种植已有进一步的发展，这是进一步发展农业生产、提高农民购买力的中心环节。农民出卖的商品粮一九五○年（从一九四九年第四季度到一九五○年第三季度，以下照此推算）为一百一十五万吨，一九五一年为一百三十五万吨，一九五二年将达到一百四十六万吨。一九五○年农民出卖土产和副业产品折粮九十二万吨，一九五一年达到一百六十万吨。豆、麦商品作物的耕种面积，一九四九年是八十二万垧，一九五一年已达到一百一十九万垧；产量已由一九四九年的五十八万吨增加到一九五一年的一百零四万吨。据海伦永安村和腰房身屯的调查，农民购买力一九五一年比一九五○年提高了百分之四十二点七。农民购买力提高的主要原因是农村商品经济的发展。
    第四、农村合作互助经济已成为农村经济形态中的主体。各种类型的劳动互助组，已占总农户的百分之七十二点五（全省共有互助组十五万多个，六十八万九千多农户参加），占农村总劳力数的百分之八十二点九；单干的个体农民约占农户的百分之二十七左右（主要是中农）；新富农已出现，在少数地区并有某些发展，根据上述六个村的调查，新富农占农户的百分之零点四。
    根据以上情况和中共中央东北局的指示，黑龙江省今后在农村工作和农业生产中的基本任务应该是：集中力量提高单位面积产量，有条件的地区逐渐扩大开荒面积，适当地发展商品粮的种植，进一步使农民余粮商品化，以促进农民经济生活的迅速上升，使现有的中农生活更加富裕，使现有的贫农迅速赶上中农的生活水平，使少数农民能够避免下降和贫困。为此，必须继续贯彻组织起来、劳动生产、大家富裕的方针，进一步发展和巩固农民的合作互助组织，扩大农业再生产。
    合作互助运动的发展极不平衡，农民扩大再生产的要求还不能满足
    黑龙江省一九五一年的劳动互助，随着爱国丰产运动的开展，加以对互助组长进行了训练，已较一九五○年进一步地巩固和发展了。春耕夏锄中，全省有五万一千六百一十九个互助组（占全省互助组总数百分之三十四点二）订立了爱国丰产计划，另有二万六千六百七十一个组（占全省互助组总数百分之十七）订了爱国公约，并开展了竞赛。因此，改变了过去“春插夏散秋垮台”的现象，使劳动互助在改进技术、提高单位面积产量、发动妇女和半劳力参加生产、农业和副业相结合、生产和供销相结合等方面都有了新的发展；更重要的是在大多数互助组中都进行了爱国主义的思想教育。
    但劳动互助的发展仍是极不平衡的，在许多农村中合作互助经济的优势地位仍不够巩固。
    在工作较好的先进村，因领导力量较强，互助运动已逐步巩固、提高和扩大。这些村子里，共产党员、青年团员带头参加互助组，有好的劳动模范互助组做样子；互助组内部改进了技术，结合了副业生产，多打了粮食，增加了收入，因而解决了农民扩大再生产的问题，农民已在互助中得到了较大的实际利益。在这类村子中，组织起来的优越性已充分显示出来，中农和富裕中农绝大多数参加了互助组，一般农民都羡慕和倾向于组织起来。但这类村子还是少数。在一般的村子，特别是工作较落后的村子中，因为领导机关放松对合作互助运动的领导、部分党员雇长工和单干，缺乏好的互助组做样子，一般互助组内生产内容不充实，也不能顺利进行扩大再生产，农民在互助组中得不到更多的实际利益。在工作比较落后的村子中，中农和富裕中农
    （有两三个马能独立耕作的）大部是单干，新富农已经出现，发展生产的旗帜握在富农和单干户手中，农民羡慕单干户和富农，合作互助运动逐渐消沉，临时性的互助组日渐增多。
    从各种类型的互助组所占的比重来看，也可以看出合作互助运动的发展是很不平衡的。黑龙江省合作互助的组织形式可分为四种类型：
    第一种类型是临时性的互助组。这类组是马插犋、人在春季临时换工，是小型的低级的形式。这类组数量很大，在全省约占组织起来的总户数的百分之三十到四十；落后村中这类互助组更多。
    第二种类型是季节性的互助组。在农业方面三大季在一起插犋换工，副业单干。这种互助组织可以解决农业生产的精耕细作和合作开荒等问题，但还不能完全解决扩大再生产的问题。这类互助组是今天全省农村合作互助的主要形式，约占组织起来总户数的百分之四十到五十。这类组在一般村较多。
    第三种类型是常年农副业结合的互助组。这种互助组有生产计划，实行农副业结合，注意提高技术。一般的有技术分工，少数的实行了分工分业。其中一部分已有部分公共农具和牲畜或公积金。这类互助组一般是比较大型的，能初步解决农民扩大再生产的问题。这类互助组在合作互助运动有基础和有劳动模范的村子中较多，约占组织起来总户数的百分之十五到二十左右。
    第四种类型是实行土地、劳力、畜力入股的合伙组和以使用新式马拉农具为特点、打破地界进行集体生产的农业生产合作社。合伙组以靠近内蒙的一带地区为最多。因这一带多是沙土地，常受风灾、旱灾的袭击，在互助中先种后种关系产量很大，农民为避免个人遭受灾害，自发地组织了合伙组，伙种、伙打、伙分。这类组都是小型的（一组两三户到五、六户）不太固定的（一年一变），绝大多数只是在农业的三大季进行生产合作，农、副业不结合，技术改进很差，内部还有许多不合理的制度。因此，这类组大多数还不能解决农民扩大再生产的问题。这类组全省约有二百余个。农业生产合作社是合作互助组织中最高级的形式，社内户和户间已打破地界，使用苏联新式马拉农具耕种，实行农业副业结合，分工分业，有统一的生产计划，因地种植，能更合理地调配劳力，提高劳动效率。这类组织能更好地解决农民扩大再生产问题，是引导农民走向社会主义的集体化的过渡形式。这种农业生产合作社目前全省只有四个。
    发展与巩固合作互助组织的方针和应注意解决的几个问题
    根据以上情况，今后黑龙江省对劳动互助的方针应该是：（一）在互助基础较差的落后村，大力发展第一类的合作互助组织，并把第一类组提高到第二类组；还要有重点地培养常年互助组作为第一、二类组的榜样。对某些干部认为临时插犋、换工不叫互助，因而采取排斥和放弃领导的错误态度，必须予以纠正。（二）在一般村应有领导地大量发展和提高第二类互助组。（三）在互助基础较好的先进村，应有领导地积极发展和推广第三类互助组。
    （四）对合伙组应加强领导，争取其中的大部分逐渐做到和副业结合，和改进技术结合，达到常年合作互助；个别有条件的可适当扩大，贷给新式农具，把它提高到农业生产合作社。应有重点地建立以新式马拉农具为主的技术推广站，以推广站为中心，有领导地有重点地发展农业生产合作社。
    为进一步巩固、提高和发展劳动互助组织，应注意解决以下几个问题：
    第一、目前进一步巩固和提高劳动互助的关键是：一方面要解决中农要求扩大再生产的问题，另
    一方面要解决贫农要求经济迅速上升的问题。为此，必须引导有马户和无马户、有资金户和无资金户组织起来，也就是使中农的剩余资金、畜力和贫农的剩余劳力结合起来，以便进行扩大再生产。为此，必须有领导地合理组织互助组的资金，合作购买新式农具，合作开荒，合作购买胶皮车发展运输业，合作发展副业和手工业，或合作兴修水利、组织牧畜合作社发展牧畜业等等。总之，单纯依靠农业是不能解决农民扩大再生产的要求的，只有从多方面去增加互助组的财富，多打粮食，互助合作运动才能巩固发展。因此，一些较有基础的互助组应该适当扩大，逐步走向分工分业。此外，还要有计划地使互助组和农村的信贷合作社和供销合作社结合起来。
    第二、领导互助组总结和推广爱国丰产运动和丰产新纪录的经验，普遍奖励创造丰产新纪录的农民和互助组。各县、区、村都应当选出各种作物的丰产新纪录的最高标准，传播丰产经验，号召大家学习。同时，要号召每个好的互助组都用一定数量的土地，进行加工细作、改良技术，创造各种不同作物的丰产新纪录。
    第三、贯彻换工互助中的等价互利政策。目前中农在农村政治经济上占优势地位，在互助组中已发生排斥困难户、无马户（贫农）的现象。如马工工资高、人工工资低。合作开荒中劳力、畜力同等
    （有的甚至以畜力为主）分荒地分粮食的现象相当普遍。这样，畜力利太大，春天投资一个马去开荒，秋后就能赚回一个马；而劳动力在生产中则降到了附属地位。这是不合理的。今后应在不使有马户吃亏的原则下，有领导地适当地逐步降低马工工资。在合作开荒中，应按劳力分地分粮，畜力则给租金或给工资。
    第四、目前已发现互助组集体雇长工、新富农和富裕中农带长工参加互助组的现象。这是一种富农经济的方向，今后互助组内部不应允许这种集体雇长工或带长工参加互助组的剥削形式存在。
    第五、要加强党对互助运动的领导。目前农村中有少数党员干部和党员对互助运动采取毫不关心的态度，有的雇长工耕种，有的自己单干。如克山县党员干部雇长工的有支部书记九名，村长二十三名，党员雇长工的有四十七名，共占全县党员总数的百分之四点三；单干的党员二百名，占全县党员百分之十一。肇东县党员雇长工的占百分之三，单干的占百分之十五点五。这个县的第四区三百五十四个党员中，雇长工的四十九个，占百分之十三点九。第十四区三百八十四个党员中，参加劳动互助的只有四十七个。这种向资本主义经济方向发展的倾向严重地妨碍了互助合作运动的发展。此外，去年部分地区对互助运动的领导还有严重的放任自流倾向，这种倾向使互助运动逐渐消沉。因此，县区党委和农村支部必须加强对互助组的政治领导和思想教育；首先要加强对党员的思想教育，使他们懂得：党员雇工是不允许的，单干是不对的。党员应该积极参加各种类型的互助组，并说服单干的农民参加合作互助，领导农民向农业集体化的方向前进。
    第六、县、区应按季召开互助组代表会议，总结交流经验，训练和培养互助组骨干，并注意健全组内民主管理制度。
    第七、提倡国营农场和互助组相结合。农场应在技术上给周围的互助组以指导和帮助，以农场为中心训练互助组技术干部，并可用苏联马拉农具、拖拉机和互助组订代耕合同。同时，各县应有计划地组织农民参观国营农场，以国营农场机械化大生产的优越性教育农民。各地国营农场脱离群众、孤立生产的倾向必须纠正。
