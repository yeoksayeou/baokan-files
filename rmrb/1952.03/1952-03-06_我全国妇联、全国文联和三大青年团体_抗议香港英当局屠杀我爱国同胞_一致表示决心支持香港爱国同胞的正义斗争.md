    Our All-China Women's Federation, All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Three Major Youth Organizations
    Protest the Massacre of Our Patriotic Compatriots by the British Authorities in Hong Kong
    Unanimously Expressing Determination to Support the Just Struggle of Patriotic Compatriots in Hong Kong
    [Report from this newspaper] Following the illegal arrest and expulsion of our film artists and Kowloon disaster victim representatives Sima Wensen and Li Wenxing, etc., in January, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the three major national youth organizations—the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation—issued statements respectively regarding the Hong Kong British authorities' dispatch of a large number of military police to frantically massacre our patriotic compatriots on the first of this month, and their conspiracy to arrest our patriotic people on a large scale. They expressed extreme indignation at this atrocity by the Hong Kong British authorities and once again lodged a serious protest with the British government in Hong Kong.
    The All-China Women's Federation, representing women throughout the country, stated in its declaration: "The Hong Kong British government dispatched a large number of military police on the first of this month to systematically and methodically massacre Chinese residents in Hong Kong, and to arrest our patriotic compatriots on a large scale. We cannot but warn the British imperialists once again that you are entirely responsible for the serious consequences of this open provocative atrocity, which is intended to realize the conspiracy to turn Hong Kong into an imperialist base for aggression against our country. The power of Chinese women and the Chinese people is immense and cannot be bullied. The disastrous defeat of American imperialism on the Korean battlefield is a lesson for you. We will fully support this just struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong against imperialism."
    The statement from the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles pointed out: "The brutal crimes of the British imperialists in illegally persecuting our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong have not stopped because of the unanimous indignation and solemn protests of the people of our country, but have instead increased day by day and become more serious. This fact undoubtedly proves that the British imperialist government is despicably carrying out the shameful conspiracy of the American imperialist government to systematically and methodically persecute our patriotic people. If the British imperialists do not immediately stop these crimes and conspiracies, they will be responsible for all serious consequences."
    The joint statement from the Central Committee of the Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation stated: "The Chinese people and Chinese youth cannot tolerate such barbaric and brutal crimes of British imperialism. The British imperialists, complying with the will of the United States, have intensified the bloody tragedy of arresting and killing our residents in an attempt to realize the conspiracy to turn Hong Kong into an imperialist base for aggression against our country. The British imperialists must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by this provocative act against the great People's Republic of China." The statement seriously warned British imperialism: "Chinese youth and Chinese students will fully support the struggle of our compatriots in Hong Kong to love the motherland and oppose the atrocities of imperialism."

    我全国妇联、全国文联和三大青年团体
    抗议香港英当局屠杀我爱国同胞
    一致表示决心支持香港爱国同胞的正义斗争
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会和全国三大青年团体——中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会，中华全国学生联合会为香港英当局继一月间非法逮捕、驱逐我电影艺术工作者及九龙灾民代表司马文森、李文兴等人之后，竟于本月一日派遣大批军警疯狂屠杀我爱国同胞，并阴谋大规模逮捕我爱国人民，分别发表声明，对香港英当局这种暴行表示万分愤怒，再一次向香港英政府提出严重抗议。
    全国妇联代表全国妇女发表声明指出：“香港英政府本月一日出动大批军警，有计划、有步骤地屠杀香港我国居民，并大规模的逮捕我爱国同胞，我们不能不再次警告英帝国主义者，你们这种公开的挑衅暴行，以图实现把香港变为帝国主义侵略我国的基地的阴谋，你们对这一罪行的严重后果，应负全部责任。中国妇女和中国人民的力量是巨大的不可欺侮的，美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上的惨败是你们前车之辙。我们将以全力支持香港爱国同胞这一反对帝国主义的正义斗争。”
    全国文联的声明中指出：“英帝国主义者在香港非法迫害我爱国同胞的残暴罪行，不但没有因为我国人民的一致愤慨和严正抗议而停止，反而日益增加并且更严重了。这一事实，毫无疑问的证明：英帝国主义政府是在卑鄙的执行着美帝国主义政府的有计划、有步骤地迫害我爱国人民的可耻阴谋。英帝国主义的这种罪行和阴谋，如果不火速停止，一切严重后果，将由英帝国主义者负责。”
    青年团中央委员会、全国青联总会、全国学联的联合声明说：“英帝国主义如此野蛮残暴的罪行，是我们中国人民和中国青年所决不能容忍的。英帝国主义者顺从美国意旨，变本加厉地造成捕杀我国居民的血腥惨案，以图实现把香港变成帝国主义侵略我国基地的阴谋。英帝国主义向伟大的中华人民共和国人民的挑衅行为所造成的严重后果，必须负全部责任。”声明严重警告英帝国主义说：“中国青年和中国学生将以全力支援香港我国同胞的热爱祖国、反对帝国主义暴行的斗争。”
