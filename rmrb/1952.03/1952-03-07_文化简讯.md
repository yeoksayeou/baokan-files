Cultural Briefs

The entire staff of the "Xiangyu Opera Troupe," led by the famous Henan opera actress Chang Xiangyu, have been touring patriotic performances against U.S. aggression and aiding Korea in the Central South region, starting from Xi'an for half a year, to donate a fighter plane. They have now completed their donation plan and returned to Xi'an on March 4th. Li Furen, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Branch of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea General Association, Ke Zhongping, Chairman of the Northwest Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and representatives from various literary and art groups in Xi'an, totaling more than 1,500 people, welcomed them at the station.

Since leaving Xi'an in early August last year, the "Xiangyu Opera Troupe" has performed more than 170 shows in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Nanchang, and other places over the past six months, with an audience of over 300,000 people. All the income from the charity performances, after deducting the necessary expenses, was donated to purchase fighter planes. The troupe donated a total of 1,520,000,000 RMB yuan from the performances, including Chang Xiangyu's personal donation of 40,000,000 RMB yuan from her savings over the years and all her personal income from the tour. Their patriotic enthusiasm has been admired and supported by people in the Northwest and Central South regions. Workers in many theaters in Changsha, Guangzhou, and other places volunteered to help them. Electricians in Zhengzhou voluntarily helped them renovate the lighting. The patriotic new opera "Hua Mulan" that they performed was enthusiastically welcomed by audiences everywhere.

In the practical action of this patriotic charity performance, the ideological and technical level of all members of the troupe has been improved. Chang Xiangyu said that the achievements and glory they have gained today were obtained under the education of the Chinese Communist Party and the encouragement of the Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea patriotic movement. She said: "After this performance, all members of our troupe have more deeply realized the importance of combining art and politics. We will actively participate in the great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, strive to do a good job in propaganda, and continue to transform our thinking in practice to better serve the people."

    河南戏著名女演员常香玉领导的“香玉剧社”全体人员，为捐献战斗机一架，半年来从西安转赴中南各地作抗美援朝爱国巡回义演，现已完成捐献计划，在三月四日回到西安。西北抗美援朝总分会副主席李敷仁、西北文学艺术界联合会主席柯仲平和西安市各文艺团体的代表一千五百多人曾到车站欢迎。
    “香玉剧社”自去年八月初离开西安，半年来在郑州、开封、武汉、广州、长沙、南昌等地共演出一百七十多场，观众达三十多万人。义演收入除去演出的必要开支外全部捐献购买战斗机。该剧社共计捐献演出所得人民币十五亿二千余万元，其中包括常香玉个人捐献的历年积蓄四千万元和巡回演出中的个人全部收入。他们的爱国热情，受到西北、中南各地人民的敬佩和支持。长沙、广州等地很多剧院的工人都尽义务来帮助她们。郑州电业工人曾自动帮助她们装修电灯。她们所演出的爱国主义新剧“花木兰”，更受到各地观众的热烈欢迎。
    在这次爱国义演的实际行动中，该社全体人员的思想和技术水平都提高了一步。常香玉说，他们今天所得到的成绩和光荣，是在中国共产党的教育和抗美援朝爱国运动的鼓舞下得到的。她说：“我们全社人员经过这次演出，更加深刻地认识到了艺术和政治结合的重要性。我们将积极投入反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义和反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的伟大斗争中，努力做好宣传工作，并在实践中继续改造思想，更好地为人民服务。”
