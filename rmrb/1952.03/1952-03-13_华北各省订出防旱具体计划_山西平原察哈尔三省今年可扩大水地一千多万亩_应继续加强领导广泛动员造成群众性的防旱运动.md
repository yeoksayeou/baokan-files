After the establishment of the Production and Drought Prevention Offices in North China provinces and the convening of various relevant meetings, specific drought prevention plans have been made to better ensure that spring sowing is not affected by drought. The plans all emphasize expanding irrigated land through improved irrigation management, rational water use, well-digging, and canal construction. Regarding strengthening irrigation management and rational water use, Shanxi Province proposed to expand irrigated land by one million mu based on the existing 4.82 million mu. Pingyuan Province aims to expand from the existing 3.15 million mu of irrigated land to 4.88 million mu. In terms of canal construction and well-digging, Shanxi proposes to build 330 new large, medium, and small river canal projects, drill and repair 22,780 wells, promote 20,000 waterwheels, and drill 101 new artesian wells, which can expand irrigated land by 898,931 mu. Pingyuan Province plans to build six new canals, dig 30,000 brick wells (originally planned for 20,000), 1 million earthen wells, sink 5,000 spring wells, and promote 33,000 waterwheels, which can expand irrigated land by 4.33 million mu. Chahar Province plans to dig 60,925 wells, install 10,740 waterwheels, and expand irrigated land by 551,203 mu. Suiyuan Province is preparing to build 14 water conservancy projects of varying sizes, which can protect one million mu of land from drought. Baoding Prefecture in Hebei Province has proposed a plan to dig 100,000 earthen wells, aiming to have "a well for every plot of land" and expand the area of irrigated land. Pingyuan Province is also preparing to widely launch small-scale water storage projects, mobilizing the masses to dig and repair water pits and carry out pump irrigation to expand irrigated land by 516,200 mu. Shanxi requires every farming household to develop small-scale water conservancy projects, collect snow and ice, and dig pits for water storage to ensure that they all have one mu of moisture-retaining land; areas with suitable conditions should strive to exceed this; the province should have 3.5 million to 5 million mu of moisture-retaining land. Chahar Province has proposed that each household should ensure 1.5 mu to 3 mu of pre-sowing moisture-retaining land.

According to the above plans, Shanxi Province can strive to have 11 million mu of land unaffected by drought, more than double the original irrigated land. Pingyuan Province can increase irrigated land by 6,496,200 mu, which, together with the original 3.15 million mu of irrigated land, will reach 9,646,200 mu, more than twice the original irrigated area. Chahar Province can expand irrigated land by 1.7 million mu, an increase of 62.9% compared to the original irrigated area. These three provinces alone can expand irrigated land by more than 10 million mu.

In terms of the supply of spring plowing materials, various provinces have made some preparations. Of the 20,000 waterwheels planned for supply in Shanxi Province, more than 18,600 have been ordered, half of which have already been loaned to the masses. Chahar Province has completed 4,000 waterwheels and plans to complete 10,000 by the end of June. The supply of waterwheels in Suiyuan Province has doubled compared to the original plan (1,500 units), and one-third has been completed. Throughout North China, the fertilizer supply has completed slightly more than 23% of the amount needed for spring sowing. Chahar Province has prepared more than 6 million jin of seeds (more than half of the total task) to be loaned to the masses and has conducted germination tests on the seeds. The province currently has 10,000 seven-inch walking plows distributed to various prefectures, and plans to complete the supply of another 10,000 walking plows before the end of April, and allocated 28 million jin of relief grain and 100 million jin of grain for production support, which can be distributed to the masses before March 20 to ensure that the masses can engage in production with peace of mind. The Hebei Province Cooperative is preparing to complete the production and sales of 2 million jin of cottonseed oil soap by mid-May to supply farmers to fight against insect pests.

With the help of the people's government, farmers in various places have actively launched drought prevention and resistance movements. Many farmers have begun digging wells, digging canals, carrying ice, collecting snow, watering land, and harrowing land to preserve moisture, laying a favorable foundation for spring plowing. Pingyuan Province universally launched a snow collection movement after the snowfall. For example, in the Fourth District of Gaotang County in Liaocheng Prefecture, more than 13,000 male laborers were mobilized to use carts, wheelbarrows, baskets, and other tools to transport snow to the fields, increasing the snow in the fields by more than double the original snowfall. Shanxi Province has also launched snow collection movements one after another. For example, in Yushe County in Yuci Prefecture, more than 10,000 mu of land has benefited from the use of snow and ice accumulation, and they are now opening canals and digging wells to strive to irrigate 3,000 mu of watered land; 20 villages in Lingchuan and Wuxiang in Changzhi Prefecture have accumulated 600,000 dan of snow, which can preserve moisture for more than 8,800 mu of land. Incomplete statistics from Huai'an and other five counties in Chanan Prefecture, Chahar Province, show that more than 16,600 mu of land can be sown on time because they have already been spring-irrigated; in areas where conditions for irrigation are not available, the masses carry ice to irrigate the land. For example, in Shanghuayuan and other seven villages in the Fourteenth District of Xuanhua, 540 people and 60 head of livestock were mobilized to transport more than 52,000 dan of ice in three days, which can irrigate 50 mu of land. After the land thawed, many farmers harrowed the land in a timely manner. In Hengshui Prefecture, Hebei Province, 80% of the land has been harrowed once.

Although drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing preparation work have begun, they are not yet widespread, and in particular, have not yet penetrated the masses and become a conscious movement of the masses. Some cadres and the masses have serious paralysis in their thinking because of the two snowfalls (the actual amount of snow is extremely insufficient). Some district and village cadres are sitting and waiting for the "Three-Anti" campaign and preparing to be "rectified." All of these hinder the progress of drought prevention, drought resistance, and preparation for cultivation. At the same time, the leadership in some counties is still stopping at general calls and has not made widespread mobilization and specific arrangements. In the preparation of material supply, some economic departments, such as cooperatives, native product companies, agricultural tool factories, and banks, have not yet put forth enough effort to support this movement. Hebei's fertilizer supply has only completed one-quarter of the task; Pingyuan has only completed 18%. Therefore, all localities must strengthen the leadership of this work, pay attention to vigorously overcoming the thinking of district and village cadres sitting and waiting for the "Three-Anti" campaign, clarify the policies to them, and explain that the "Three-Anti" campaign will not be carried out in districts and villages during the spring plowing production period. Even if they made mistakes in the past, they can unite the masses, lead production, and atone for their sins through meritorious service in spring plowing production. Similarly, the paralyzing thoughts among the masses must also be fully explained based on past historical experience and the current insufficient snowfall to raise vigilance and start early. At present, all localities should use the time to harrow as early and as much as possible, and strive to harrow two to three times to preserve moisture and ensure spring sowing. Furthermore, relevant economic departments must quickly adjust their organizations, boldly transfer, promote, and supplement cadres, quickly replenish incomplete institutions, and ensure that all materials needed for preparation for cultivation are supplied in a timely manner.

    华北各省订出防旱具体计划
    山西平原察哈尔三省今年可扩大水地一千多万亩
    应继续加强领导广泛动员造成群众性的防旱运动
    华北各省自成立了生产防旱办公室，召集了各种有关会议后，为了更好地保证春播不受天旱的影响，都作出了具体的防旱计划。在计划中，都着重地提出了要以改善灌溉管理、合理用水、打井、修渠来扩大浇地面积。在加强灌溉管理、合理用水方面，山西省提出了要在原有浇地四百八十二万亩的基础上，扩大一百万亩。平原要在原有浇地三百一十五万亩的基础上，扩大到四百八十八万亩。在修渠、打井方面，山西提出新修大、中、小河渠工程三百三十处，新凿和修复水井二万二千七百八十眼，推广水车二万部，新凿自流井一百零一眼，可扩大水浇地八十九万八千九百三十一万亩。平原省计划新修水渠六道，打砖井三万眼（原计划二万眼），土井一百万眼，凿井下泉五千眼及推广水车三万三千部，可扩大水浇地四百三十三万亩。察哈尔省计划打井六万零九百二十五眼，安装水车一万零七百四十部，扩大浇地五十五万一千二百零三亩。绥远省准备新修十四个大小水利工程，可使一百万亩土地免受旱灾。河北省保定专区提出了打土井十万眼的计划，要作到“块块地有井”，扩大水浇地面积。平原省并准备广泛举办小型蓄水工程，发动群众挖修水坑及开展抽水机灌溉，扩大浇地五十一万六千二百亩。山西要求每户农家发展小型水利、积雪、积冰、挖坑蓄水等，保证作到都有一亩保墒地；有条件的地区争取超过；全省要有三百五十万亩到五百万亩保墒地。察哈尔省提出了每户要保证作到一亩半到三亩保播地。
    按照以上计划，山西省可争取到有一千一百万亩土地不受旱灾的威胁，较原有的水浇地增加一倍多。平原可增加水浇地六百四十九万六千二百亩，连原有的水浇地三百一十五万亩，共达到九百六十四万六千二百亩，较原有浇地面积增加两倍多。察哈尔省可扩大一百七十万亩浇地面积，比原浇地面积增加百分之六十二点九。只是这三省就可以扩大水浇地面积一千多万亩。
    在春耕物资供应方面，各省都有了一部分准备。山西省计划供应的两万部水车已定购了一万八千六百多部，其中一半已贷放到群众手中。察哈尔省已完成四千部水车，计划在六月底完成一万部。绥远省的水车供应较原计划（一千五百部）提高了一倍，现已完成了三分之一。全华北的肥料供应，已完成了春播所需要的百分之二十三强。察哈尔省已准备了六百万多斤种籽（占总任务的二分之一强）贷给群众，并已作了种籽的发芽试验。这省目前已有一万张七吋步犁分到各专区，计划在四月底前再完成一万张步犁的供应，并拨出二千八百万斤救济粮及一亿斤扶植生产的贷粮，可在三月二十日以前一律发到群众手中，保证群众能安心生产。河北省合作社准备在五月中旬完成二百万斤棉油皂的制销工作，以便供给农民向虫害作斗争。
    各地农民在人民政府的帮助下，已积极开展防旱抗旱运动，许多农民已开始打井、挖渠、背冰、积雪、浇地、耙地保墒等，为春耕打下了有利的基础。平原省在雪后普遍地展开了积雪运动。如聊城专区高唐县四区就发动了一万三千多男劳动力以大车、小车、篮、筐等工具，把雪运到地里，使地里的雪较原有的降雪量增加了一倍。山西全省也先后展开积雪运动。如：榆次专区榆社县已用积雪、积冰的办法使一万多亩土地受益，现正开渠、打井，争取浇三千亩水地；长治专区的陵川、武乡二十个村，就积雪六十万担，能使八千八百多亩地保存墒土。察哈尔省察南专区怀安等五县不完全的统计，就有一万六千六百多亩地，因为已经春汇，保证能按时播种；没有条件汇地的地区，群众就背冰浇地，如宣化十四区上花园等七个村就发动了五百四十人，六十头牲口，三天运冰五万二千多担，可浇地五十亩。土地解冻后，许多农民及时地进行了耙地。河北衡水专区已有百分之八十的土地耙了一遍。
    防旱、抗旱和春耕准备工作虽已开始，但还不普遍，特别是还没有深入群众，成为群众自觉的运动。一部分干部和群众因为两次下雪（实际雪量极不够），有严重的麻痹思想。有些区村干部在坐待“三反”，准备“挨整”。所有这些，都妨碍了防旱、抗旱、备耕工作的进行。同时，有些县的领导还停止于一般的号召，没有作到广泛动员和具体布置。在物资供应的准备上，一些经济部门如合作社、土产公司、农具工厂和银行等，还没有拿出足够的力量来支持这个运动。河北的肥料供应仅完成了任务的四分之一；平原仅完成百分之十八。因此，各地必须加强对这一工作的领导，注意大力克服区村干部坐待“三反”的思想，对他们讲清政策，说明春耕生产期间区、村坚决不进行“三反”，即使自己过去犯了错误，也正好在春耕生产中团结群众，领导生产，立功赎罪。同样，对群众中的麻痹思想也要根据过去历史经验和现在雪量不足的情况，作充分的解释，以便提高警惕，及早动手。目前各地应利用时间，做到早耙多耙，争取普耙两遍至三遍，以保存水分，保证春播。再则，有关经济部门必须很快地调整组织，大胆地抽调、提拔和增补干部，迅速补全残缺的机构，保证作到适时供应备耕中的一切物资需要。
