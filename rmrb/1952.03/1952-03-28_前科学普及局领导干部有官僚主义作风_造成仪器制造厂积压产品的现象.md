　　Former Leading Cadres of the Bureau of Scientific Popularization Exhibit Bureaucratic Work Style, Leading to a Backlog of Products at the Instrument Manufacturing Factory

    Editor: The former leading cadres of the Bureau of Scientific Popularization under the Central Ministry of Culture have a serious bureaucratic work style, which has resulted in a large amount of capital being tied up in the Instrument Manufacturing Factory under its leadership. The Bureau of Scientific Popularization, without any investigation or research, ordered the factory to manufacture a large number of electric slide projectors. These slide projectors were of fine quality and high cost. After receiving this task, the factory workers demonstrated production enthusiasm and creativity, overfulfilling the annual production target. However, only 40 percent of these products were sold. Factory Director Feng reported this situation to the Bureau of Scientific Popularization several times, but the responsible cadres of the Bureau of Scientific Popularization turned a deaf ear.

    Later, the Bureau of Scientific Popularization adopted a "treat the head when the head aches" approach to solve this problem, ordering the factory to switch to manufacturing gas-powered slide projectors. However, changing the production plan required half a year of preparation. In order to avoid a situation of having no work to do in the first quarter, at the request of the factory workers, the Bureau of Scientific Popularization ordered the factory to continue producing the unsold electric slide projectors in the first and second quarters. Gas-powered slide projectors are all made by fitters and do not require the lathes, planers, and milling machines used to produce electric slide projectors. When the factory was producing gas-powered slide projectors, 80 percent of the machines in the factory had to be idled. We have reported this situation many times, but the Bureau of Scientific Popularization has not taken any action.

    The Instrument Manufacturing Factory was originally a factory specializing in the manufacture of physics and chemistry instruments for middle schools. It is inappropriate for the Ministry of Culture to transform it to manufacture slide projectors because it does not need instruments. The factory has a large stock of instruments, but the Bureau of Scientific Popularization instructed the factory "not to sell" because it "does not need money." This is also wrong.

    The Bureau of Scientific Popularization's leadership over the factory is very inadequate. In the past two years, the Bureau of Scientific Popularization has only sent people to the factory three times. The Bureau of Scientific Popularization has only played the role of transmitting information between the Central Ministry of Culture and the factory.

    We hope that the Bureau of Scientific Popularization will thoroughly solve these problems in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

### 前科学普及局领导干部有官僚主义作风  造成仪器制造厂积压产品的现象

　　前科学普及局领导干部有官僚主义作风
    造成仪器制造厂积压产品的现象
    编辑同志：前中央文化部科学普及局的领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，致使该局所领导的仪器制造厂积压了大批的资金。科学普及局未经过任何调查研究，即令该厂制造大量的插电式幻灯机。这种幻灯品质精细、成本很高。该厂职工接到这个任务后，发挥了生产积极性和创造性，超额完成了年度的生产任务。但是，这批产品只销出了百分之四十。该厂冯厂长曾经几次向科学普及局反映这个情况，但科学普及局的负责干部却置若罔闻。
    后来科学普及局以“头痛医头”的办法来处理这个问题，命令该厂改制汽灯式幻灯机。但是，改变生产计划需要半年的准备时间，为了避免第一季度发生无活做的现象，经该厂职工要求，科学普及局又命令该厂在第一、第二季度继续生产滞销的插电式幻灯机。汽灯式幻灯机都是钳工，用不着生产插电式幻灯机用的车刨铣床，在该厂生产汽灯式幻灯机时，厂内百分之八十的机器都得闲起来。我们曾多次反映了这个情况，但科学普及局都不作处理。
    仪器制造厂原是一个专门制造中学理化仪器的工厂。文化部因其不需要仪器，而改造幻灯机，这是不应该的。该厂存有大批仪器，但科学普及局因为“不需要钱”，竟指令该厂“不出售”。这也是错误的。
    科学普及局对该厂的领导是非常不够的。两年来，科学普及局只派人到过该厂三次。科学普及局只是起了中央文化部与该厂之间的传达作用。
    我们希望科学普及局在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，彻底解决该厂这些问题。
