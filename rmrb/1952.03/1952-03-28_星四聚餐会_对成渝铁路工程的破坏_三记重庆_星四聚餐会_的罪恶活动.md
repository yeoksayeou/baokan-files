    The Sabotage of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Project by the "Star Four Dinner Party"
    ——Three Records of the Sinister Activities of the Chongqing "Star Four Dinner Party"
    By Our Correspondent Lin Li
    The more we see the sinister facts of the "Star Four Dinner Party," the more we feel the severity of the harm this group of lawless capitalists is causing to the nation's construction efforts. In undertaking the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, the destructive and thieving activities carried out by the "Star Four Dinner Party" seriously hindered the progress of the project and greatly shortened the railway's lifespan. The losses it brought to the nation and the people cannot be calculated in numbers.
    Everyone still remembers that when the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway began construction, the representatives of the Chongqing bourgeoisie repeatedly expressed their "willingness to contribute everything to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway." They said: "As long as the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway requires private factories, we will go all out and spare no effort to help." However, how did the member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" "help" and "contribute" to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway?
    Here, we can first look at the crimes of the Yuxin Steel Plant.
    The Yuxin Steel Plant is one of the member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party." Below the General Steelmaking Plant, there are also ironmaking yards, coal yards, and two machine shops. It is the largest private factory in Southwest China. The Yuxin Steel Plant once contracted the rail spike project for the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau. This batch of rail spikes was originally to be manufactured by a state-owned factory. Li Zhiqin, the manager of the Yuxin Steel Plant, learned about this in advance. On one hand, he directed Zhou Shaowen, a mole placed by the "Star Four Dinner Party" in the state-owned factory, to set the rail spike price at 17 million yuan per ton; on the other hand, he went to the Railway Bureau to stir up trouble, saying: "The state-owned factory wants 17 million yuan, but I only need 16.8 million yuan here." Li Zhiqin thus contracted this large batch of rail spike project and made the Railway Bureau extremely dissatisfied with the state-owned factory. According to Li Zhiqin, the forging cost of each ton of rail spikes was at most 3.8 million yuan (including legitimate profits) when the manufacturing contract was signed. But because there was no other factory in the Southwest that could do it, he did 5.75 million yuan less work. Li Zhiqin raised the forging cost of each ton of rail spikes by 1.95 million yuan, which was exactly 50 percent higher than the reasonable price. He stole over 300 million yuan of state property on this forging project alone. At that time, the low-carbon steel used to manufacture rail spikes cost only 8 million yuan per ton; but Li Zhiqin insisted on setting it at more than 11 million yuan, stealing more than 470 million yuan of state property by inflating material prices. The above is only a rough estimate of the theft of state property in terms of estimating work and materials before construction. What is particularly infuriating is what happened during the manufacturing process of the rail spikes. Li Zhiqin not only failed to construct according to engineering specifications, but also replaced low-carbon steel with some kind of iron material. The price difference between steel and iron is huge, and the performance is vastly different. As a result, some of the rail spikes made were so large that they broke the sleepers, some were so small that they could not grip the rails tightly, some had nail heads that came off as soon as they were hit, and some bent as soon as they came into contact with the sleepers. Therefore, every rail spike threatened the safety of the trains. According to the person in charge of the Railway Bureau, if the railway built with this batch of rail spikes was lucky enough not to have an accident, the service life of the railway would be shortened by one-third compared to the expected lifespan. This cruel sabotage by the Yuxin Steel Plant is the "help" and "contribution" of the "Star Four Dinner Party" to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, which the people of Southwest China have long awaited. (Note: To ensure traffic safety, the Railway Bureau has begun to replace these substandard rail spikes.)
    The "Shanghai Machinery Factory," another member factory of the "Star Four Dinner Party," has always been known for monopolizing water turbines in Southwest China. Its manager, Mao Yike, is a nationally renowned water turbine "expert" and was therefore hired by the Southwest Military and Political Committee's Finance and Economics Committee as a "member." At the beginning of the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Mao Yike contracted 30 water pumps and diesel engines. Hundreds of large and small bridges and culverts along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway depended on these water pumps to be the pioneers in erecting bridges. Therefore, when the water pumps arrived at the construction site, the workers jumped up and down with joy, saying: "This is a liberation. We can use machines to replace manual labor." Some even composed lyrics to welcome the water pumps, saying: "We will pump the spring water that has never dried up for a thousand years, and we will suck it dry, so that our train can victoriously drive to Chengdu." However, the workers' enthusiastic expectations were immediately doused with cold water. During the emergency repair of a bridge project in the Ziyang section, the workers were troubled by the undrainable spring water, and the water pump manufactured by Mao Yike happened to arrive. People cheered in unison to welcome it and immediately installed and started the water pump. However, as soon as the motor started, with a loud bang, the massive flywheel came off the axle and flew two or three zhang away, almost hitting the workers who were working there. The people disappointedly carried the flown flywheel back and reinstalled it, but after rotating for a few minutes, it flew off the axle again. All 30 machines had such frequent accidents and could not be used at all. It not only failed to replace manual water pumping, but also tied up a large number of workers to repair the machines. And the "mole" sent by the "Star Four Dinner Party" to the Railway Bureau coldly mocked, saying: "The workers are hicks and can't even operate the machines." It was not until the Railway Bureau took back this batch of water pumps and asked mechanical experts to inspect them that it was discovered that about 50 percent of the main parts of the diesel engines and water pumps manufactured by Mao Yike were pieced together with waste materials. None of the "fuel injectors" of the 15 diesel engines were new. This nationally renowned "expert" and "member" used these scrap iron and rotten materials to put together water pumps and diesel engines. He himself obtained a huge profit of 1.17 billion yuan; the loss caused by hindering and delaying the progress of the project is incalculable. This is another "help" and "contribution" of the "Star Four Dinner Party" members to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway!
    The obstruction and sabotage of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway by the "Star Four Dinner Party" was not limited to the individual activities of individual factories. It also sent its "capable general" Wu Zongkai to form the "Star Five Dinner Party" with nine iron workshops in order to carry out organized and planned sabotage. In October 1950, Wu Zongkai contracted the clamp board project for the Railway Bureau's construction of the Youxi temporary bridge. The Youxi Bridge is the first bridge from Chongqing to Youxi. Only by building this bridge can traffic be opened to Youxi on time and the road construction plan for 1950 be successfully completed. Wu Zongkai is known as a "railway expert," and he is well aware of the significance of clamp boards for building bridges. After receiving the news that the Railway Bureau was contracting out the temporary bridge clamp boards, he immediately conspired with his member factories to raise prices. When the Railway Bureau asked them to undertake the construction of the temporary bridge clamp boards, the member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" replied in unison: "We don't have new flat iron, so we don't dare to contract it." During this process of coercion and difficulty, Wu Zongkai ran out and said: "I can do it, but the price will be higher." As a result, a contract was signed to undertake the construction of 880 temporary bridge clamp boards at a price 80 percent higher than the reasonable price. After Wu Zongkai and others obtained the huge profits from raising prices, they began to steal materials and cut corners to sabotage the project. They did not use new flat iron to manufacture temporary bridge clamp boards, but instead used waste ship plates and rotten boiler iron. They knew that this illegal behavior would arouse opposition from the workers in their own factories, so they decided not to do it in the factory, but to hire temporary workers and build tents in a remote wilderness to carry out the construction. As a result, the clamp boards made were of different sizes, uneven thicknesses, and more than 80 percent unusable. Wu Zongkai spared no effort to steal materials and cut corners, and also carried out a series of sinister activities in the process of delivering goods. He knew that the clamp boards he made would not be easy to deliver, so he did not deliver the goods in batches, but sent hundreds of clamp boards all at once on the day before the contract expired. Because the time was short, the inspectors could not complete the inspection in time. Wu Zongkai arrogantly said: "I have delivered the goods and you have not inspected them. Who is responsible for the losses due to the breach of contract?" Wu Zongkai also took the clamp boards that did not meet the specifications of the Railway Bureau to the Southwest Finance and Economics Committee and the Southwest Industry Department as "evidence" to "accuse" the Railway Bureau of "bureaucracy." Wu Zongkai said: "We are in the era of handicrafts, and we are not yet mechanized. How can we guarantee that so many clamp boards are not too big or too small? I firmly oppose the bureaucracy of the Railway Bureau." At this time, all the employees who erected the Youxi temporary bridge had arrived, and all kinds of materials had also arrived, but because there were no clamp boards, the engineering team of several hundred people could not start construction. The engineering team sent three urgent telegrams to the Railway Bureau every day, the long-distance telephone urging the clamp boards never stopped, the train stopped and howled on this side of the bridge, and all the employees were restless because there were no clamp boards. However, Wu Zongkai remained calm. He pointed to those unusable clamp boards and told his partners: "If we can't deliver them today, we will deliver them again tomorrow. We must put these clamp boards in the warehouse of the Railway Bureau." So, on the one hand, they moved those unusable clamp boards back and forth again and again; on the other hand, they organized a dance troupe and opened "rooms" in the "Xindu Guest House" to let the dancers accompany the Railway Bureau's inspectors to take a bath, and let their own "lovers" accompany the Railway Bureau's personnel to "eat." Wu Zongkai used this despicable and ugly means to stop the train bound for Youxi on this side of the Youxi Bridge. According to the person in charge of the Railway Bureau, not counting the time delayed due to the clamp boards, the Railway Bureau alone compensated the engineering team for food and wages, which amounted to 3,900 kilograms of rice. This organized and planned obstruction and sabotage is another "help" and "contribution" of the "Star Four Dinner Party" to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.
    The "Star Four Dinner Party" not only delayed the opening of traffic on the temporary bridge clamp board project and carried out large-scale sabotage on the rail spike project, but also did its best to steal materials and cut corners on such an important project as the turnout. The frog rail of the turnout manufactured by the factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" was 10 centimeters higher than the main rail; the distance from the tip of the frog rail to the main rail at two meters away should not exceed three millimeters according to regulations, but what they made exceeded 30 millimeters. The important position of turnouts on the railway is well known, and a difference of one millimeter may cause the train to derail. The factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" once made a large number of railway materials, but everything they manufactured was not only stolen and cut corners in large quantities, but also seriously hindered and sabotaged the progress of the project, or greatly shortened the life of the railway. All the turnouts and rail spikes manufactured by the member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" had to be completely dismantled, redone, and repaired. The losses this brought to the country and the people were really too great!
    At the beginning of the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, Chongqing's private steel and machinery industry was in a precarious situation; it was only because of the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the assistance of the People's Government in various aspects that Chongqing's steel and machinery industry was spared death or bankruptcy, and many factories relied on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to recover, develop, and expand, and many factory owners made a fortune from the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. According to a survey by the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce: Since the start of the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, more than 400 machinery factories in Chongqing have been revived, thousands of iron workshops have work to do, and industries related to road construction such as cement, carpentry, construction, bricks and tiles, transportation, chemical industry, and electrical equipment have also recovered, developed, and exceeded any historical period. Therefore, when the
    first train passed between Bashan and Shushui, the representatives of the bourgeoisie also repeatedly praised: "The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has paved the way for the development of industrial production in Southwest China." "The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is indeed a road to happiness." They almost exhausted the good words, but they also did all the bad things. How can the people of Southwest China and even the whole country not be angry at the sabotage and obstruction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway by the "Star Four Dinner Party"!

    “星四聚餐会”对成渝铁路工程的破坏
    ——三记重庆“星四聚餐会”的罪恶活动
    本报记者  林里
    越看“星四聚餐会”的罪恶事实，就越感到这群违法资本家对于祖国建设事业危害的严重。在承做成渝铁路工程上，“星四聚餐会”所进行的破坏性的盗窃活动，严重地阻碍了工程的进展，大大地缩短了铁路的寿命，它给国家和人民所带来的损失是不可能用数字计算的。
    大家都还记得，当成渝铁路动工之初，重庆资产阶级的代表们，曾经再三表示“愿为成渝铁路贡献一切”。并且说：“只要是修筑成渝铁路所需要于私营工厂的，我等将全力以赴，不遗余力地来帮助。”然而，“星四聚餐会”的会员厂是如何“帮助”和“贡献”于成渝铁路的呢？
    这里，我们可以首先看看渝鑫钢铁厂的罪行。
    渝鑫钢铁厂是“星四聚餐会”的会员厂之一，在炼钢总厂以下，还有炼铁场、煤炭场和两个机器场。它是西南私营工厂中最大的一个。渝鑫钢铁厂曾经包揽过西南铁路工程局道钉工程。这批道钉，原来是要交给国营某工厂制造的。渝鑫钢铁厂经理李志亲事先知道了这件事，他一面指挥“星四聚餐会”安排在国营某工厂的坐探分子周绍文，让他把道钉造价定为每吨一千七百万元；一面到铁路局挑拨说：“国营工厂要一千七百万元，我这里只要一千六百八十万元。”李志亲就这样包揽了这一大批道钉工程，并且弄得铁路局对国营某工厂极度不满。据李志亲说：签订制造道钉合同时，每吨道钉的锻制费用顶多不过三百八十万元（包括合法利润在内）。但因为西南再没有那家工厂可做，所以他就少了五百七十五万元不做。李志亲把每吨道钉的锻制费用抬高了一百九十五万元，恰比合理价格高百分之五十。仅在这个锻制工程上，他就盗窃国家财产三亿元以上。当时制造道钉的低炭钢，每吨不过八百万元；但李志亲硬要定为一千一百多万元，在哄抬料价上又盗窃国家财产四亿七千多万元。以上还只是在施工以前，单在估工估料方面盗窃国家财产的粗略统计。特别使人愤怒的，是在制造道钉过程中。李志亲既不按着工程规格施工，又用某种铁料代替了低炭钢。钢与铁的差价极大，性能悬殊。因此，做出来的道钉，有的大得撑坏了枕木，有的小得扒不紧路轨，有的钉帽一打即脱，有的一和枕木接触就弯曲。因此，每一个道钉都威胁着行车的安全。据铁路局负责人说：用这批道钉修成的铁路，假若侥幸不出事故，铁路的使用时间也要较预期的寿命缩短三分之一。渝鑫钢铁厂这种残忍的破坏，就是“星四聚餐会”对西南人民长期盼望的成渝铁路的“帮助”和“贡献”。（按：为了保证行车安全，铁路局已开始撤换这些不合规格的道钉。）
    “星四聚餐会”的另一会员厂“上海机器厂”，素以垄断西南水轮机自居。它的经理毛毅可，是全国著名的水轮机“专家”，并因此而被西南军政委员会财政经济委员会聘请为“委员”。成渝铁路动工之初，毛毅可曾经包揽了三十部抽水机和柴油机。成渝沿线数百个大小桥梁和涵洞，就依赖这些抽水机做架设桥梁的开路先锋。因此，当抽水机到达施工地点时，工人们高兴地跳着说：“这可解放了，可以用机器代替人工了。”有的还为迎接抽水机编下了歌词，说：“千年不干的泉水，我们要把你抽干吸尽，让我们的火车胜利地开到成都。”然而，工人们的热情期待立时被浇上了一瓢冷水。在抢修资阳段某一桥梁工程中，工人们正为排不干的泉水所困惑，毛毅可所制造的抽水机恰好赶到了。人们一致欢呼着迎接它，立刻把抽水机安装并开动起来。然而，马达刚刚发动，就在轰然一声巨响之后，庞然大物的飞轮脱轴而出，一下飞出两三丈远的地方，差一点砸着正在那里做工的工人兄弟。人们失望地把飞走了的飞轮搬回，重新装起，但转动不几分钟又脱轴飞起。三十部机器都是这样事故百出，根本不能使用。它不但不能代替人工抽水，而且把大批工人牵制住去修理机器。而“星四聚餐会”派进铁路局的“坐探”，反冷眼嘲笑着说：“工人是土包子，连机器也操作不了。”直到铁路局把这批抽水机重新收回，请机械专家检验以后，才发现毛毅可所制造的柴油机和抽水机，主要机件有百分之五十左右是用废料搭配的。其中十五部柴油机的“喷油嘴”，竟没有一个是新的。这位闻名全国的“专家”兼“委员”，就用这些废铁烂料拼凑成了抽水机和柴油机。他自己获得十一亿七千多万元的暴利；阻扰和延误工程进度的损失是无法计算的。这就是“星四聚餐会”分子对于成渝铁路的又一“帮助”和“贡献”！
    “星四聚餐会”对于成渝铁路的阻扰和破坏，还不仅限于个别厂的个别活动。它还派了它的“干将”吴宗楷，把九家铁作业组成“星五聚餐会”，以便进行有组织有计划的破坏。一九五零年十月，吴宗楷包揽了铁路局修建油溪便桥的夹板工程。油溪桥是重庆通往油溪的第一座桥梁。只有修起这座桥，才能按时通车到油溪，才能胜利完成一九五零年的筑路计划。吴宗楷被人称为“铁路通”，他十分清楚夹板对于修建桥梁的意义。他得到铁路局发包便桥夹板的消息后，立即和他的会员厂密谋哄抬造价的方式方法。当铁路局要他们承造便桥夹板时，“星四聚餐会”的会员厂一同回答说：“没有新扁铁，不敢包揽。”就在这种要挟和刁难的过程中，吴宗楷跑出来说：“我可以做，不过价钱要高一些。”结果，以高出合理价格百分之八十的工价，签订了承做八百八十块便桥夹板的合同。吴宗楷等得到哄抬造价的暴利后，又开始了偷工减料的破坏活动。他们不用新扁铁制造便桥夹板，而用废船板、烂锅炉铁来代替。他们知道这种不法行为会激起本厂工人的反对，便决定不到工厂去做，而雇用临时工，在
    一个偏僻的旷野搭起帐棚施工。结果，做出来的夹板大小不一，厚薄不匀，百分之八十以上不能用。吴宗楷挖尽心机地偷工减料，又在交货过程中进行了一连串的罪恶活动。他知道他所做的夹板不容易交上，就不陆续送货，而在合同期满的头一天，把几百块夹板一下都送了去。因为时间短促，验收人员一时检验不完。吴宗楷便狂妄地说：“我交了货你们不验收，违反合同的损失由谁负责？”吴宗楷还把铁路局验收不合规格的夹板拿到西南财政经济委员会和西南工业部，做为“控告”铁路局“官僚主义”的“证据”。吴宗楷说：“我们是手工业时代，还没有机械化，那里能保证那末多的夹板不大也不小？我坚决反对铁路局的官僚主义。”就在这个时间，架设油溪便桥的职工已经全部到达，各种材料也已全都到齐，只是因为没有夹板，几百人的工程大队不能动工。工程队一天给铁路局三个加急电报，催促夹板的长途电话终日不停，火车停在桥的这边吼叫，所有职工人员都为没有夹板而坐卧不安。然而，吴宗楷却处之泰然。他指着那些不能用的夹板，告诉他的伙伴们说：“今天交不上，明天再去交。一定要把这些夹板摆在铁路局的库房里。”于是，他们一面把那些不能用的夹板，一次又一次地搬来又搬去；一面组织舞女团，在“新都招待所”开了“房间”，让舞女们陪同铁路局的验收人员去洗澡，让他们自己的“爱人”陪铁路局人员去“吃饭”。吴宗楷就用这种卑鄙而又丑恶的下流手段，把要通往油溪的火车，阻止在油溪桥的这边。据铁路局负责人说：因为夹板而延误的通车时间不算，铁路局单是赔偿工程队的伙食工资费，就合三千九百斤大米。这种有组织有计划地阻扰和破坏，是“星四聚餐会”对于成渝铁路的又一“帮助”和“贡献”。
    “星四聚餐会”不仅在便桥夹板工程上延误了通车时间，也不仅在道钉工程上大肆破坏，而且竟然在道岔这样重要的工程上，也极尽其偷工减料的能事。由“星四聚餐会”各厂所制造的道岔，辙轨比正轨高十公分；辙轨尖端至正轨两公尺处的距离，按规定不得超过三公厘，而他们做的竟超过了三十公厘。道岔在铁路上的重要地位是众所周知的，一公厘的差数都可能招致火车出轨的危险。“星四聚餐会”各厂，曾经做了许许多多的铁路器材，但所有他们所制造的东西，没有一样不经过大量地偷工减料，也没有一样不严重地阻扰和破坏了工程的进展，或大大地缩短了铁路的寿命。凡是用“星四聚餐会”会员厂制造的道岔和道钉，都不得不再彻底拆除、重做重修。由此带给国家和人民的损失实在太大了！
    成渝铁路动工之初，重庆私营钢铁机器业还处于摇摇欲坠的情况下；只是因为成渝铁路的兴工，和人民政府在各方面的扶助，重庆的钢铁机器业才免于死亡或倒闭，而且许多工厂依靠成渝铁路恢复、发展并扩大了，许多工厂的老板依靠成渝铁路发了大财。据重庆市工商业联合会调查：自从成渝铁路动工以来，重庆四百多机器厂复活了，上千户的铁作业有工可做了，与筑路有关的水泥、木作、建筑、砖瓦、运输、化工和电工器材等等行业，也都恢复发展并超过了历史上的任何时期。因此，当第
    一列火车在巴山蜀水之间驶过的时候，资产阶级的代表们也一再称赞说：“成渝铁路给西南工业生产的发展铺平了道路。”“成渝铁路实在是一条通往幸福的道路。”好话几乎被他们说尽，坏事却又被他们全都做完。“星四聚餐会”对于成渝铁路的破坏和阻扰，西南乃至全国的人民，怎能不愤怒！
