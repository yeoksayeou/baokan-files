　　Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 27th: According to newspaper reports, the Iraqi parliament's approval of the agreement between Iraq and the British Petroleum Company has aroused great indignation among the Iraqi masses. The opposition parties in Iraq have issued a public statement urging the Iraqi people to "reject this agreement that infringes upon national rights."

　　On February 19th, Iraq held a general strike to protest the Anglo-Iraqi agreement. In the days leading up to the strike, the Iraqi government, fearing the great dissatisfaction of the people with the enslaving terms of the Anglo-Iraqi agreement, warned the people that if they opposed the oil agreement, the government authorities would take severe measures. The streets of major Iraqi cities were filled with police and troops. "Troublemakers" were arrested. "Al-Shaq Newspaper" reported that all educational institutions and schools in Iraq were closed for fifteen days to prevent protests and demonstrations.

　　Despite these police measures, in many major cities in Iraq—Baghdad, Basra, Mosul, and others—the masses still shouted slogans against imperialism and held demonstrations.

    伊拉克各地人民示威
    反对奴役性的英伊石油协定
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社德黑兰二十七日讯：据报纸报道，伊拉克议会批准伊拉克和英国石油公司之间的协定一事，引起了伊拉克广大群众的极大愤慨。伊拉克的反对党派已经发表公报，敦促伊拉克人民“拒绝这个侵犯国家权利的协定”。
    二月十九日，伊拉克举行了总罢工，抗议英伊协定。在罢工前几天，伊拉克政府慑于人民大众对英伊协定奴役条件的极大不满，警告人民说，如果人民反对石油协定，政府当局将采取严厉的措施。伊拉克大城市的街道上布满了警察和军队。“不稳分子”都被逮捕了。“阿尔·夏克报”报道，伊拉克所有的教育机构和学校都关门十五天，以防止抗议示威。
    尽管有这些警察措施，但是在伊拉克的许多大城市——巴格达、巴士拉、摩苏尔等地，群众还是高喊着反对帝国主义的口号，举行了示威。
