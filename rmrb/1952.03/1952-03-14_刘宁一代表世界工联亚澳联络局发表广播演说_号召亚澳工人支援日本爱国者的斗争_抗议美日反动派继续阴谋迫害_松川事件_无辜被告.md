Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: Liu Ningyi, representing the World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau, delivered a radio speech once again to the working people of Asia and Australia to protest the continued conspiracy of the US and Japanese reactionaries to persecute the twenty innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." The broadcast first pointed out that the "Matsukawa Incident," concocted single-handedly by the US and Japanese reactionaries to persecute those who bravely fought for Japanese national independence, peace, and democracy, had aroused angry protests from people all over the world and resolute resistance from the Japanese people. The truth has been completely exposed, and the conspiracy has been completely unmasked; therefore, the Sendai High Court of Japan was forced to decide on December 20th of last year to "re-trial." Now, people all over the world clearly see that the so-called "crimes" of the twenty defendants are completely fictitious and fabricated; the "Matsukawa Incident" is a repeat of the "Nazi Reichstag fire."

The broadcast pointed out that this initial victory of the struggle once again proves that as long as the working class of the world unites with the peace-loving and democratic people of the world, any attack and persecution by the reactionaries against the people can be repelled and defeated!

The broadcast then said, "Although the 'Matsukawa Incident' has been ordered for re-trial, the attempt by the US and Japanese reactionaries to suppress Japanese progressive organizations and the rising national liberation movement of the Japanese people has not only not stopped but has intensified. Recently, new provocations and persecutions have emerged one after another. The US and Japanese reactionaries are using the Hokkaido train derailment, the Matsusaka fire, the murders of police officer Indo in Itabashi, Tokyo, and police officer Shiratori in Sapporo, and the so-called 'military espionage case' of Iida Shichizo and six others as excuses to arrest and try large numbers of Japanese progressives and continue to intensify the persecution of innocent Japanese people.

The people of the world know, and even the Yoshida government understands, that the truly advanced organizations of the working class do not resort to terrorist means in their just struggles for peace, democracy, and improved working and living conditions. The people of the world also know very well that Prime Minister Yoshida is also fully aware that it is the imperialists and those traitors who, in order to realize their ulterior, despicable, and dirty ambitions, resort to arson, assassination, and the creation of other provocative incidents to carry out their various destructive activities. This is an old method inherited by American criminals from Hitler's fascists. The reason why they want to persecute the progressive organizations of the Japanese people is simply because the latter wholeheartedly represent the interests of the Japanese people and openly struggle against the US-made "San Francisco Peace Treaty" and the so-called "US-Japan Security Treaty," against turning their own country into a colony, and turning the Japanese people into slaves of US imperialism. The progressive organizations of the Japanese people oppose the reactionary policies of the Yoshida government, which attempts to push the motherland into the abyss of suffering, and oppose turning the Japanese people into cannon fodder for the US imperialists' war of aggression; and this struggle has won the enthusiastic support and support of all the Japanese people—from workers, farmers, intellectuals, and even some capitalists—giving a serious blow to the US imperialists' evil plan of large-scale war of aggression, which is being actively promoted; this is the real reason why the American occupiers are angry and actively create various incidents to intensify the persecution of the Japanese people and their progressive organizations.

The broadcast emphasized that the freedom-loving Japanese people will never bow their heads and submit to the reactionaries! They will stand at the forefront of the battle for peace and true democracy! This arrogant ambition and action of US imperialism equally threatens the independence of all nations in the East and the freedom and democracy of the people, and threatens the cause of peace and justice for mankind in the world. The heroic and unremitting struggle of the Japanese people for independence, democracy, peace, and happiness has won the full sympathy and firm support of the people all over the world, especially the millions of workers in Asia and Australia. Therefore, we firmly believe that the Japanese people will surely achieve the final victory!

The broadcast finally issued a call saying: Workers in Asia and Australia! People who love peace, democracy, and justice! Continue to organize widespread protests and provide strong support to all Japanese patriots who are still being persecuted in every possible way. Demand the immediate withdrawal of the charges against the twenty innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and demand the immediate release of all innocent defendants.

People's Peace Committees in Various Parts of Italy Strongly Protest Against the US Military's Bacteriological Warfare in Korea
Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: The Italian people have risen up to protest against the crimes of the American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare. According to a Rome report by the Electric Communication Agency on the 11th, some doctors, scientists, and intellectuals in Turin, an industrial city in northern Italy, have sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council, strongly condemning bacteriological warfare and demanding punishment for the criminals who conduct bacteriological warfare.

The Rome Peace Committee issued a statement on the 10th, denouncing the US military's crime of using bacteriological weapons in Korea. This statement has been sent to the speaker and members of the Italian Parliament, the Italian Red Cross, various democratic groups, and cultural workers, asking them to demand that all countries in the world strictly abide by the Geneva Protocol prohibiting bacteriological warfare.

The trade union committee of Naples, an important seaport in Italy, passed a resolution on the 10th, denouncing the US military's crime of spreading bacteria in Korea. The resolution pointed out that this crime is as serious as the most serious crimes committed by the Nazis.

A mass rally was held in Piombino, a center of the steel industry, on the 10th to protest against the US military's bacteriological warfare in Korea; the rally also elected a delegation to hand over the protest resolution to the municipal authorities. The Magona factory in the city sounded its sirens especially to express the protest of the steelworkers.

The Peace Committee of Livorno Port, the electrical and chemical workers of Bariano, and the steelworkers of Terni also passed resolutions on the 10th denouncing the US military's use of bacteriological weapons.

The Danish People Believe That the Crimes of the American Aggressors Are More Sinister and Shameless Than Hitler's Death Camps
Xinhua News Agency, March 11th: According to a Copenhagen report by the Electric Communication Agency, the Danish Communist Party organ "Land and People" published an editorial on the 10th, sternly denouncing the US aggressors' crime of conducting bacteriological warfare. The editorial said: "The US war actions in Korea have deteriorated to a level more despicable than Hitler's death camps, crematoria, and gas chambers." The editorial said: "We Danes believe that the Danish government, as a member of the Atlantic Pact, as part of the US war machine, and as a member of the United Nations, which is now conducting bacteriological warfare in its name, has a responsibility to make a strong protest while there is still time, so that new war criminals cannot harm humanity. All good people must rise up against this barbarity, against this loss of human morality, against this crime that our language cannot describe."

    刘宁一代表世界工联亚澳联络局发表广播演说
    号召亚澳工人支援日本爱国者的斗争
    抗议美日反动派继续阴谋迫害“松川事件”无辜被告
    【新华社十三日讯】刘宁一代表世界工会联合会亚澳联络局为抗议美、日反动派继续阴谋迫害“松川事件”二十名无辜被告，再次向亚洲和澳洲劳动人民发表广播演说。广播词首先指出：美、日反动派为了迫害争取日本民族独立与和平、民主而勇敢斗争的人们所一手制造的“松川事件”，激起了全世界人民的愤怒抗议和日本人民的坚决反抗，真相已经彻底暴露，阴谋已经完全被揭穿；因而日本仙台高等裁判所被迫于去年十二月二十日决定“重新审判”了。现在全世界人民都清楚地看到：二十名被告的所谓“罪状”，完全是虚构和捏造的；“松川事件”是“纳粹国会纵火案”的再版。
    广播词指出：这一斗争的初步胜利又一次证明了：只要全世界的工人阶级与全世界爱好和平民主的人民团结一致，任何反动派对于人民的进攻、迫害，都是可以打退和击败的！
    广播词接着说：“松川事件”虽然已下令重审了，美、日反动派镇压日本进步组织，镇压日本人民日益高涨的民族解放运动的企图，不仅没有停止，而且是更为加紧了。最近新的挑衅、迫害事件更加层出不穷。美、日反动派正藉口北海道火车出轨、松阪火灾、东京板桥的警察印藤和札幌的警察官白鸟被杀害、以及所谓饭田七三等七人的“军事间谍案”等，在大批逮捕、审判日本的进步人士，继续加紧迫害无辜的日本人民。
    全世界人民都知道，连吉田政府也很了解，工人阶级真正的先进组织，在其为和平、为民主、为改善劳动生活条件的正义斗争中，是不采用恐怖手段的。全世界人民更知道，吉田首相也完全清楚，正是帝国主义者及那些卖国贼，为了实现其不可告人的卑鄙龌龊的野心，才采用放火、暗杀以及制造其他挑衅事件来进行其各种破坏勾当。这是美国犯罪者从希特勒法西斯那里继承过来的旧方法。他们所以要迫害日本人民的进步组织，只是因为后者全心全意地代表日本人民的利益，并公开地进行斗争，反对旧金山美制“和约”和所谓“美日安全条约”，反对变自己的祖国为殖民地，变日本人民为美帝国主义的奴隶。日本人民的进步组织反对企图把祖国推下痛苦深渊去的吉田政府的反动政策，反对把日本人民去充当美帝国主义者侵略战争的炮灰；而且这一斗争获得了全体日本人民——从工人、农民、知识分子，甚至部分的资本家——的热烈支持和拥护，给予了美帝国主义正在日益积极推行的大规模侵略战争的罪恶计划以严重的打击；这就是美国占领者所以恼怒和积极制造各种事件来加紧迫害日本人民及其进步组织的真正原因。
    广播词强调说：爱好自由的日本人民，绝不会向反动派低头屈服的！他们将站在争取和平、争取真正民主的战斗的最前列！美帝国主义这种狂妄的侵略野心和行动，同样地威胁着东方一切民族的独立与人民的自由、民主，威胁着世界人类的和平正义事业。日本人民为谋取独立、民主、和平、幸福所进行的英勇不懈的斗争，获得了全世界人民特别是亚洲、澳洲千百万工人的充分同情与坚决支持。因此，我们深信日本人民一定能够取得最后的胜利！
    广播词最后发出号召说：亚洲、澳洲的工人兄弟们！爱和平、爱民主与正义的人们！继续组织广泛的抗议，用各种可能的方式，给予仍在遭受迫害的一切日本爱国者以有力的支援。要求立即撤销对“松川事件”二十名无辜被告的起诉，要求立即释放全体无辜被告。
    伊朗“忠言报”发出紧急呼吁号召人民抗议美国可耻罪行
    【新华社十三日讯】据电通社布拉格十二日讯：伊朗和平拥护者协会的机关报“忠言报”最近刊载了一项紧急呼吁，号召伊朗人民起来抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行。
    “忠言报”指出美国使用细菌武器的危险说：“这种危险不仅威胁一个国家或者威胁一国人民，而是威胁着世界各国的人民。”“这样恶毒的，可耻的罪行是史无前例的”。
    “忠言报”号召全国人民，不论住在什么地方，不论是什么社会地位，都起来对于全世界亿万人民所维护的国际公法所严禁的这种滔天罪行，提出严正的抗议。
    意大利各地人民与和平委员会强烈抗议侵朝美军进行细菌战
    【新华社十二日讯】意大利人民群起抗议美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行。据电通社罗马十一日讯：意大利北部工业城市都灵市的一些医师、科学家和知识分子，已打电报给联合国安全理事会，强烈地斥责细菌战，并要求惩罚进行细菌战的罪犯。
    罗马和平委员会十日发表声明，痛斥美军在朝鲜使用细菌武器的罪行。这个声明已经送给意大利议会的议长和议员、意大利红十字会、各民主团体和文化工作者，请他们要求全世界各国严格遵守禁止进行细菌战的日内瓦议定书。
    意大利重要海港那不勒斯的工会委员会在十日通过决议，斥责美军在朝鲜撒布细菌的罪行。决议指出：这种罪行和纳粹分子所犯下的最严重的罪行同等严重。
    炼钢业中心城市皮奥宾诺十日举行了群众大会，抗议美军在朝鲜进行细菌战；大会并选出代表团，将抗议决议交给市政当局。这个城市的玛戈纳工厂特别长鸣汽笛，表示炼钢工人们的抗议。
    里窝那港和平委员会、巴力安诺的电业工人和化学工人、特尔尼的炼钢工人也都在十日通过了斥责美军使用细菌武器的决议。
    丹麦人民认为美国侵略者的罪行比希特勒的死亡营还更恶劣无耻
    【新华社十一日讯】据电通社哥本哈根讯：丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民”在十日发表社论，严正斥责美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行。社论说：“美国在朝鲜的战争行为，已经恶劣到比希特勒的死亡营、烧人炉和毒气杀人室更卑劣的程度。”社论说：“我们丹麦人认为：丹麦政府作为大西洋公约成员国，作为美国战争机器的一部分，作为现在正用它的名义进行细菌战的联合国的会员国之一，有责任在目前还来得及的时候提出强有力的抗议，使新的战犯不能伤害人类。一切善良的人都必须起来反对这种野蛮行为，反对这种丧失人类道德的行为，反对这种我们的语言所无法形容的罪行。”
