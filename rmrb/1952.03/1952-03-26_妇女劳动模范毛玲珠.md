    Model Woman Laborer Mao Lingzhu
    Editor: Mao Lingzhu, a military dependent and model laborer from Zhou Shen Village, Jiangguo District, Fenghua, Zhejiang, toiled like an animal for the landlord in the old society, never having enough to eat year-round. In famine years, she had to eat chaff and wild vegetables; she only had one pair of torn trousers to wear. After liberation, during the land reform, she and her husband, Wang Ahong, boldly and fully poured out their grievances, bravely struggled against the landlord, and were allocated six mu and three fen of land and two rooms. Not only were they active in production, but they also worked hard for the village. Mao Lingzhu was therefore honored to join the Communist Youth League. Last spring, when the township mobilized for military service, she encouraged her husband to join the army. At the farewell, she encouraged her husband, saying, "You must bravely kill the enemy at the front. Don't worry about things at home, I will take care of everything myself. I am waiting for you to return home victoriously soon." After her husband joined the army, the peasants wanted to cultivate her land for her. She thought that if every military dependent family had their land cultivated for them, the burden on the peasants would be too heavy. Now that men and women are equal, can't I learn to produce? So she joined the mutual aid team for cultivation, working from dawn till dusk, actively engaging in production. Last summer, during pest control, she mobilized 106 women to remove more than 350,000 withered seedlings. When the pest control was first launched, some backward masses did not believe that it would be beneficial. She used real objects and examples to publicize it to everyone, breaking through their thinking. During the drought, she mobilized women to tread waterwheels and dig ditches, and asked elderly women to boil tea at home. At the same time, she also promptly organized a busy farming season nursery, so that women participating in production did not have to worry about their babies not being cared for. In the slack season, she led women to make straw sandals and weave hemp fibers to donate to airplanes and artillery. Last year, when delivering patriotic public grain, she first mobilized women to fan and dry the grain, and then took the lead in delivering the golden, full grain to the public granary. This year on New Year's Day, Mao Lingzhu attended the county-wide labor model representative conference, was named a second-class labor model, and also received many agricultural tool prizes, wearing a bright red flower of glory on her chest. She happily said: "Today's glory is given to me by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. I will always listen to Chairman Mao and follow the Communist Party. In the future, I must work harder, actively take the lead in production, mobilize the masses, and do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy."

    妇女劳动模范毛玲珠
    编辑同志：浙江奉化江国区周沈村军属、劳动模范毛玲珠，在旧社会里整年给地主做牛马，一年到头吃不饱。遇到荒年，只得吃糠吃野菜；他只有一条破单裤子穿。解放后进行土地改革时，她和她的丈夫王阿宏大胆尽情地诉苦，勇敢地斗争了地主，分到了六亩三分田和二间房子。他们夫妻不但生产积极，而且努力作村里的工作，毛玲珠因此光荣地参加了青年团。去年春季，乡里发动参军，她就动员自己的丈夫去参军，在送别时，她鼓励她的丈夫说：“你到前方要勇敢杀敌人，家里的事情你不用担心，一切我自己会解决的，我等着你早日胜利回家。”她丈夫参军后，农民们要给她代耕，她想，乡里有许多军属，如果户户代耕，农民们负担太重了，现在男女平等，难道我不能学习生产吗？于是她参加了代耕互助组，早出晚归，积极生产。去年夏季除虫时，她发动妇女一百零六人，拔除了枯心苗三十五万多根。刚发动除虫时，个别落后群众不相信除虫有好处，她就用实物和实例向大家宣传，打通他们的思想。在抗旱时，她又发动妇女车水、挖沟，让老年妇女在家里烧茶水。同时还及时地组织农忙托儿所，叫参加生产的妇女不必担心自己的娃娃没人照护。在农闲时她带领妇女做草鞋打麻筋，捐献飞机大炮。去年交爱国公粮时，她先发动妇女扇谷、晒谷，然后自己带头把黄橙橙饱满满的谷子送到公仓里。今年元旦，毛玲珠出席全县劳动模范代表大会，被评为二等劳动模范，还得了好多农具奖品，胸前带着一朵通红的光荣花。她快乐地说：“今天的光荣是毛主席和共产党给我的，我要永远听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，今后更要努力，积极带头生产，发动群众，把增产节约搞好。”
