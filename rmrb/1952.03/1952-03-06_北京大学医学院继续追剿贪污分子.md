To the Editor: In the initial stage of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, many people at Peking University Medical College believed that the school was a "clean government office and there would be no corruption," and that "there was no need to engage in anti-corruption in the school." Facts have proven that this right-leaning thinking is wrong. Not only is there corruption in our school, but the phenomenon of corruption is very serious. Many embezzlers have been discovered so far, and some embezzlers are very stubborn and cunning. The embezzler, Bai Shanlin, was a ledger clerk in the pharmacy. His life was very decadent, and he had two wives. He had many tricks: colluding with private merchants for personal gain, taking kickbacks, stealing medicines, reporting less than the actual amount, and secretly altering accounts, stopping at nothing. Because his hands were not clean, he was afraid of being exposed, so he showed courtesy to people everywhere, giving them fruits and ballpoint pens, trying to win them over. When the anti-corruption movement was launched, he stubbornly refused to confess. He secretly formed an "offensive and defensive alliance," threatening other embezzlers to prevent them from reporting him. Later, the leaders publicly named some embezzlers and asked them to explain their problems. Only then did he become anxious. He quickly confessed some corrupt acts to the organization, but it was very incomplete. He feigned madness and used suicide to scare people. That night, he overturned the corrupt acts he had confessed during the day, and formed an "offensive and defensive alliance" with the corrupt officials Li Tongnian and Ding Jiuying. However, the school's Thrift Examination Committee checked his accounts clearly, and he could not deny his corrupt acts, but he was still obsessed and tried to muddle through. On February 15, the responsible comrade of the Central Health Department talked to him, explained the policies of the People's Government to him, and the comrades of the Thrift Examination Committee repeatedly enlightened him. Only then did he confess the crime of embezzling 110 million yuan, but it was still incomplete.
    The "Tiger Hunting Team" of Peking University Medical College is now pursuing the victory, and everyone is determined to "never withdraw until the matter is thoroughly investigated."

    北京大学医学院继续追剿贪污分子
    编辑同志：在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的初期，北京大学医学院很多人认为学校是“清水衙门，不会有贪污”，“在学校里不必搞反贪污”。事实证明这种右倾思想是错误的。我校不只有贪污，而且贪污的现象很严重。目前已发现许多贪污分子，而好些贪污分子是十分顽固、狡猾的。贪污分子柏善林，是药房司账员，他的生活非常腐化，他有两个老婆。他的花样多得很：勾结私商营私舞弊、拿回扣、偷盗药品、以少报多、偷改账目，无所不为。他因为手上不干净，怕人揭发，到处向人献殷勤，送水果、送原子笔，企图拉拢别人。反贪污运动展开时，他死不坦白。他暗地里订立“攻守同盟”，威胁其他贪污分子，不让别人检举他。后来领导方面当众点了一些贪污分子的名，要他们交代问题。这时他才急了。他赶紧向组织上交代了一些贪污罪行，但是很不彻底。他装疯卖傻，并以自杀吓唬人。当晚他又把白天所坦白的贪污罪行推翻，又同贪污犯李桐年、丁玖英订了“攻守同盟”。但是校节约检查委员会把他的账目都查得清清楚楚，他无法否认贪污罪行，但仍执迷不悟，企图蒙混过关。二月十五日中央卫生部负责同志找他谈话，向他解释人民政府的政策，节约检查委员会的同志又再三启发他，他才坦白了贪污一亿一千多万元的罪行，但是还不彻底。
    北京大学医学院的“打虎队”，现正乘胜追击，人人都下定决心，“不搞彻底，决不收兵”。
