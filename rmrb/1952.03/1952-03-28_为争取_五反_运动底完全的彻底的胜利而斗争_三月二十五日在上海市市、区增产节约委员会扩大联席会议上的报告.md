Shanghai citizens!

I announce: Our struggle in Shanghai against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence has officially begun.

For three years, the Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party have been uniting with the Chinese national bourgeoisie entirely in accordance with the policies stipulated in the Common Program. They have sent their representatives to the people's representative conferences at all levels and to the people's governments at all levels. They have ample conditions and full opportunities to act according to the rules and regulations. When the national financial situation showed a temporary contraction in 1950, and national industry and commerce encountered difficulties, the People's Government implemented measures such as processing orders, purchasing finished products, and bank loans to help the bourgeoisie tide over the difficulties. The working class also helped the bourgeoisie overcome difficulties at this time. This enabled the national bourgeoisie, which was dying under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, not only to catch its breath in a short period after liberation, but also to obtain profits unprecedented during the twenty-two years of Kuomintang reactionary rule. It can be said that the working class and the Communist Party have been benevolent and righteous to the national bourgeoisie, and there is nothing they have done to wrong them. However, many lawless elements of the national bourgeoisie have different intentions and other plans. After obtaining political status and high economic profits, they not only did not appreciate the working class and the Communist Party, but instead ungratefully launched a frenzied attack on the working class and the Communist Party. They violated the Common Program and carried out many open and secret sabotage activities, destroying the country's economic construction, national defense construction, resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and people's production and construction. They systematically dispatched and placed their economic spies inside the Communist Party, inside the People's Government, inside the People's Liberation Army, especially inside the financial and economic organs, like blood vessels inserted into various departments of the state organs, unscrupulously carrying out bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence and other destructive activities. Their profit-seeking, self-serving, opportunistic, and unscrupulous nature has been fully exposed. Just imagine, if the rampant attacks of the illegal bourgeoisie were allowed to run rampant, what would be the future of our country? Undoubtedly, the new democratic economy would not be built successfully, the people's lives would not be improved, and the socialist future would not be realized. Therefore, in response to the crimes of the illegal bourgeoisie, a vigorous and large-scale struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence is completely necessary and can no longer be delayed. We must solemnly warn all law-breaking capitalists that the People's Government and the people can no longer tolerate your crimes. Unless you repent, thoroughly confess in accordance with the laws of the People's Government, return the stolen goods and money, and guarantee that you will not repeat the same mistakes in the future, the People's Government and the people will never forgive you, and will give your rampant attacks economic blows and legal sanctions! All illegal capitalists, no matter how high their position in the government, no matter how great the cause they are engaged in, no matter how skilled they are in managing production technology, and no matter how strong their foundation for forming cliques for private gain, whether they make false accounts, form offensive and defensive alliances, or evade and conceal, the People's Government has the right and full confidence to impose severe sanctions.

Shanghai citizens! Shanghai is a place where Chinese industry is concentrated, and it is also the place where the Chinese national bourgeoisie is most concentrated. Therefore, the Shanghai bourgeoisie ranks first among the national bourgeoisie, which is in line with the facts. The Shanghai bourgeoisie used to boast about this to each other, which caused dissatisfaction among bourgeois elements in various places, which is also a well-known fact. Therefore, it should be admitted that the sabotage carried out by illegal elements in the Shanghai bourgeoisie in the country's economic construction is all-round, and its poisonous gas is overwhelming. Its rampant attack not only has its own set of methods in economics but also in politics. It has already taken a serious step of destroying the Common Program, which is also in line with the facts. The rampant attacks of the Shanghai illegal bourgeoisie against the Chinese Communist Party, the working class, and the People's Government are more organized and planned than the bourgeoisie in other parts of the country, the attacking techniques are more sophisticated, the degree of viciousness is also the greatest, and the rampant attacks rank first among the national bourgeoisie, which is also in line with the facts. Even the Shanghai bourgeoisie cannot deny this. Therefore, since the "Five-Anti" struggle should be thorough and strict in all parts of the country, not only should it not be an exception in Shanghai, but it should be even stricter and more thorough. Failure to do so will definitely be unpopular and too unfair. I believe that Shanghai's "Five-Anti" struggle is the key to the success or failure of the national "Five-Anti" struggle. Shanghai citizens should take the lead in shouldering the glorious task of breaking the rampant attack of the Shanghai illegal bourgeoisie. Shanghai's "Five-Anti" struggle is only allowed to succeed, not to fail. I hope that the majority of citizens will respond to the government's call, enter the combat post, and await action. As far as Shanghai capitalists are concerned, if they are truly patriotic elements, if they are truly law-abiding elements, if they have indeed committed crimes but are willing to repent, they should also support the "Five-Anti" and actively participate. This is also predictable. We will let the Shanghai bourgeoisie choose this point themselves.

I should point out to everyone: The People's Government's adoption of such a policy towards illegal capitalists does not mean that the People's Government's policy towards the bourgeoisie has changed, or that the people's democratic dictatorship has changed into an alliance of three classes. This is completely wrong, completely not the case. The policy of uniting with the bourgeoisie has not changed. The Chinese People's Democratic Dictatorship is still the people's democratic united front regime of the Chinese working class, the peasant class, the urban petty bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic elements under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party. The "Five-Anti" struggle is not the same as the land reform struggle, which eliminates the landlord class in the same way as it eliminates the bourgeoisie. The "Five-Anti" struggle only eliminates the bad things among the bourgeoisie that endanger the national economy and the people's livelihood: that is, eliminate the criminal acts of bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. After the "Five-Anti", and the elimination of the "five poisons", the bourgeoisie can act according to the rules and regulations within the scope of the Common Program and the laws of the People's Government. The bourgeoisie can honestly engage in undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood under the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy, so that the country's economic construction can develop healthily towards the road to prosperity. This is the fundamental purpose of the "Five-Anti" movement. For example, the "both public and private interests" policy must be correctly implemented under the leadership of state-owned enterprises. This is stipulated in the Common Program. The bourgeoisie's attempt to deny and usurp the leadership of state-owned enterprises is illegal and must be corrected in the "Five-Anti" movement. Another example is the "both labor and capital benefit" policy, which must be correctly implemented under the leadership of the working class. This is also stipulated in the Common Program. The bourgeoisie has always distorted it and used it to attack the working class, which is also illegal and must be corrected in the "Five-Anti" movement. Therefore, we can understand that the "Five-Anti" movement is to realize the Common Program, ensure the implementation of the People's Government's policies, and oppose the sabotage of illegal elements of the bourgeoisie. After the "Five-Anti", private enterprises must take into account the capitalists' profits and the factory's public accumulation fund, as well as the state's tax revenue and the workers' welfare, and it is no longer allowed to only take into account the capitalists' interests, regardless of the interests of the other three parties. Only in this way can the correct policy of "both public and private interests and both labor and capital benefit" stipulated in the Common Program be reasonably realized.

All law-abiding capitalists and those who have committed crimes in the past but have now clearly explained the issues do not need to worry. The bourgeoisie is completely allowed to exist legally throughout the entire period of the New Democracy. You are completely allowed to engage in legal businesses and earn legal profits, and are protected by the government. However, violating the Common Program, launching a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and the working class, and carrying out the five poisons is not allowed.

Some illegal capitalists said that the People's Government will carry out "Five-Anti" today, and "Seven-Anti" or "Eight-Anti" tomorrow. Today, it opposes the bourgeoisie, and tomorrow it will oppose the petty bourgeoisie. This kind of propaganda is to confuse the public and expand the ranks of the profiteers. But this is in vain. The content and scope of the "Five-Anti" stipulated by the People's Government are very clear. The "Five-Anti" is to oppose bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence. It should neither be narrowed nor expanded. Small rebates are not considered bribery, but only small problems. Of course, small problems should also be corrected. Being blackmailed is called being blackmailed, and cannot be called bribery. Accidental leaks, unintentionally talking about the country's financial situation, should be opposed and corrected, but cannot be called spies, nor can it be considered theft of state economic intelligence. Concealing enemy and puppet property and evading and exchanging foreign exchange is of course an act of stealing state property, and must be opposed, but do not list it as a separate item, which was originally included in the "Five-Anti". Other issues such as closing factories, stopping salaries, and stopping meals have already been expressly prohibited by the Military Control Commission of this city and can be handled in accordance with the promulgated laws.

Some law-breaking capitalists also said that the policies of the Central People's Government are good, but will Shanghai implement them without any discount? Or, will Beijing implement them very well, and will Shanghai also implement them very well? This is also malicious slander, the purpose of which is to resist the "Five-Anti". It must be told to everyone that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government, there is only one policy in the country, and Shanghai has never been and will never be an exception. Based on the "Standards and Methods for Classified Treatment of Industrial and Commercial Households in the 'Five-Anti' Movement" approved and promulgated by the State Council of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, we also roughly divide Shanghai's 163,400 industrial and commercial households (excluding 110,000 peddlers) into five categories: law-abiding households, which are estimated to account for about 15% of the total number of industrial and commercial households. Basically law-abiding households, which are estimated to account for about 50% of the total number of industrial and commercial households; we also plan to relax the standards and stipulate that those whose illegal profits are less than 10 million yuan and who have thoroughly confessed and explained the situation will still be regarded as basically law-abiding households. Half-law-abiding and half-law-breaking households, which are estimated to account for about 30% of the total number of industrial and commercial households; we also plan to relax the standards and stipulate that those whose illegal profits are more than 10 million yuan, but who can thoroughly confess, sincerely repent, and actively report others and make meritorious service, can also be regarded as basically law-abiding households. Seriously law-breaking households and completely law-breaking households, which are estimated to not exceed 5% of the total number of industrial and commercial households, of which the extremely small number of those with heinous crimes that cannot be calmed without handling them; even those with great crimes can be leniently reduced if they can thoroughly confess, sincerely repent, and actively report others and make meritorious service. All law-breaking capitalists can choose their own path between confession and resistance, leniency and severity. Those who confess sincerely will be given appropriate reductions or exemptions; those who refuse to confess will be severely punished.

After the start of the "Five-Anti" movement, we will successively adopt the three procedures of capitalists' self-reporting and public evaluation, collective review by workers and shop assistants, and approval by the municipal and district production increase and economy committees based on the "Standards and Methods for Classified Treatment of Industrial and Commercial Households in the 'Five-Anti' Movement" approved and promulgated by the State Council of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. After the gradual review is completed, the cases can be finalized separately and the processing notice can be issued. Among these three procedures, the second procedure (collective review by workers and shop assistants) is the most important. All capitalists must go through this review by workers and shop assistants. If the workers and shop assistants do not pass it, they cannot be given a conclusion.

I have already clearly explained the People's Government's policies and policies on the "Five-Anti". The Shanghai bourgeoisie should rise up and choose their own way out. I think they should support the above-mentioned correct "Five-Anti" policies. They should honestly confess their "five poisons" crimes in front of the people. Honestly obey the people's inspection and the People's Government's handling. After the handling, ensure that they will not repeat the same mistakes in the future and honestly participate in the country's economic construction, do their part, and obtain legal profits. This prospect is indeed very bright. Implementing the "Five-Anti" is beneficial to the bourgeoisie, and this reason is also very clear. I think the majority of the Shanghai bourgeoisie will choose the path of confession and thoroughly explaining the problems. However, since we have been in contact with the Shanghai bourgeoisie for three years, we know very well that there are good people and bad people among them; we also know very well that some of them are indeed very bad in their style of work, stirring up trouble when things happen. They are trying to deny the facts and insist on resisting the "Five-Anti". They regard the People's Government's lenient treatment as a sign of weakness; they think the People's Government does not dare to touch them, so they refuse to confess. This attitude of resisting the "Five-Anti" and resisting the People's Government is not allowed. The People's Government must severely punish these bad elements, and the broad masses of citizens will definitely support severely punishing them, which is not a problem.

Workers, shop assistants, and staff members! You are the main body of the "Five-Anti" united front. You should stand firm on the position of the working class and distinguish yourselves from the capitalists. You have been getting along with the bourgeoisie for many years, and you know the internal situation of the bourgeoisie very well. As long as you speak, the bourgeoisie's plan to escape the "Five-Anti" will be completely defeated. The bourgeoisie usually looks down on workers. Now, in order to escape the "Five-Anti", they suddenly humble themselves to beg for mercy from the workers and conduct new bribery. You must see through the bourgeoisie's conspiracy, expose illegal capitalists, and strive for the complete victory of the "Five-Anti" struggle.

Senior staff members and senior shop assistants! You know the illegal behavior of capitalists more clearly than ordinary workers. Many "five poisons" ends of illegal capitalists are handled by you. It is possible that you have also been involved in the illegal behaviors of capitalists such as bribery, tax evasion, and shoddy workmanship. These capitalists then threaten you by saying, "Since you have been involved in the five poisons, if you tell the secrets, the government will not forgive you and will definitely punish you together." The illegal bourgeoisie is spreading rumors and provoking dissension on the one hand, and bribing you on the other. You must see through this despicable and dirty new conspiracy of the illegal capitalists. You must bravely expose the illegal capitalists and abandon the "offensive and defensive alliance". You bravely return to the ranks of the working class, make meritorious service in the "Five-Anti" and transform and improve yourselves. The People's Government can not only not hold you accountable for the past, but also reward you for your "Five-Anti" contributions.

Law-abiding, basically law-abiding, and half-law-abiding industrial and commercial households! After you have thoroughly confessed and explained your own problems, you should actively expose the illegal behavior of seriously law-breaking households and completely law-breaking households, and persuade them to thoroughly confess. If you do this and have achievements and contributions, you will be encouraged and rewarded according to the size of the achievements and contributions.

Seriously law-breaking and completely law-breaking capitalists! You are violating the law. You will be sanctioned by the state, but if you can thoroughly confess, sincerely repent, and actively report other law-breaking capitalists and make meritorious service, you can still be given a discretionary reduction of your punishment.

All Shanghai citizens! Shanghai's "Five-Anti" should be carried out in an organized and planned manner. The "Five-Anti" should be done thoroughly, but it should be "anti" but not chaotic. Only the municipal and district production increase and economy committees have the right to decide on the inspection of all industrial and commercial households. Anyone who enters industrial and commercial households under a false name to conduct inspections will be punished as theft, and industrial and commercial households and residents are allowed to report them, and the public security bureau will investigate and immediately arrest them and bring them to justice. Each inspection team is required to have official documents to prove that there are no errors before the inspection can begin. All inspection teams should abide by the stipulated inspection discipline, and shall not abuse their powers for personal gain, and shall not infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of industrial and commercial households. During the "Five-Anti" struggle, all industrial and commercial enterprises in the city should operate and produce as usual. The "Five-Anti" inspection is carried out step by step throughout Shanghai. Industrial and commercial households that are included in the inspection should respect the leadership of the inspection team and explain the problems. Industrial and commercial households that have not yet been included in the inspection should operate as usual and wait for inspection, and do not disturb each other. Those who create rumors and cause trouble to sabotage the "Five-Anti" will be severely punished. The "Five-Anti" struggle must be carried out in an organized, planned, and step-by-step manner, and normal activities and operations of industry and commerce should not be hindered. This requirement is completely necessary, and I hope that all citizens will abide by it.

The vigorous "Five-Anti" struggle in Shanghai has officially begun. I believe that we have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, correct policies and policies, and a broad "Five-Anti" united front. We will surely be able to walk out of this great struggle with the qualifications of victors, thoroughly repel the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, achieve production development, economic prosperity, and market activity, and pave the way for our country's large-scale planned economic construction.

    为争取“五反”运动底完全的彻底的胜利而斗争
    ——三月二十五日在上海市市、区增产节约委员会扩大联席会议上的报告上海市人民政府市长  陈毅
    全上海的市民们！
    我宣布：我们上海的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，正式开始。
    三年以来，中国工人阶级和中国共产党对中国民族资产阶级是完全按照共同纲领所规定的政策去团结他们的。他们在各级人民代表会议中和各级人民政府中，都派遣了他们的代表。他们完全有充足的条件，有充分的机会，规规矩矩地按章程办事。当一九五零年全国财经状况表现一度紧缩，全国工商业遇着困难的时候，人民政府又实行了加工定货、收购成品和银行贷款等办法去帮助资产阶级度过难关，工人阶级也在这时候帮助资产阶级克服困难。这样就使得在国民党反动统治下奄奄待毙的民族资产阶级，于解放之后短期内，不但喘过气来，而且获得了在国民党反动统治二十二年期间所从来未有的利润。工人阶级和共产党对民族资产阶级可以说得上是仁至义尽，毫无对他们不起的地方。但是民族资产阶级中的很多不法分子，别具肝肠，另作打算。在他们获得了政治上的地位和经济上的高额利润之后，他们不但不感激工人阶级和共产党，而竟忘恩负义地向工人阶级和共产党实行猖狂的进攻。他们违背共同纲领，进行了许多公开的和秘密的破坏活动，破坏国家的经济建设事业，破坏国防建设事业，破坏抗美援朝，破坏人民生产建设。他们有计划地向共产党内部、向人民政府内部、向人民解放军内部，特别是向财政经济机关内部派遣和安置他们的经济坐探，如像吸血管一样插在国家机关的各个部门内，肆无忌惮地进行行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报种种破坏活动。他们唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧、寡廉鲜耻的恶劣本质便完全暴露出来了。试一设想，如果让不法资产阶级的猖狂进攻自己泛滥下去，我们国家的前途将会是怎样呢？毋庸置疑，新民主主义的经济将不可能建设成功，人民的生活将不可能改善，社会主义前途将不可能实现。因此，针对不法资产阶级的罪行，来一个雷厉风行的大张旗鼓的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，在目前是完全必要的，是不能再缓的。我们必须正告一切不守法的资本家们，人民政府和人民对你们的罪行已经再不能容忍了，除非你们翻然悔改，按照人民政府的法令，彻底坦白，退出赃款赃物，保证以后不再重犯，否则，人民政府和人民将决不会宽恕你们，对你们的猖狂进攻必将给以经济上的打击和法律上的制裁！一切违法的资本家们，不管他们在政府中的地位怎样高，不管他们经营的事业怎样了不起，不管他们管理生产的技术如何高明，也不管他们结党营私的根基怎样雄厚，他们造假账也好，订攻守同盟也好，逃避隐匿也好，人民政府完全有权利也有十分把握给予严厉的制裁。
    上海市民们！上海是中国产业集中的地方，也是中国民族资产阶级最集中的地方，因而上海资产阶级在全国资产阶级中占首位，这是符合事实的。上海资产阶级过去常常以此自相夸耀，这一点曾引起各地资产阶级分子的不满，这也是尽人皆知的事实。因而便应该承认上海资产阶级中的不法分子在国家经济建设中所进行的破坏，是五毒俱全，是毒气熏天，其猖狂进攻不仅在经济上而且在政治上有他一套办法，业已走上破坏共同纲领的严重地步，这也是合乎事实的。上海不法资产阶级向中国共产党，向工人阶级，向人民政府的猖狂进攻，较之全国其他各地的资产阶级是更有组织有计划，进攻技术更高明，其恶毒程度也最大，其猖狂进攻居全国资产阶级的首位，也是符合事实的。这一点连上海资产阶级自己也不能否认。因此在全国各地开展“五反”斗争既然应该彻底、应该严格，在上海就不但不能例外，而且应该更加严格、更加彻底。不这样做，一定不得人心而且太不公道。我认为上海的“五反”斗争，是全国“五反”斗争的成败关键，上海市民们应首先担负起打破上海不法资产阶级猖狂进攻的光荣任务。上海的“五反”斗争只许成功，不许失败，希望广大市民们响应政府号召，进入作战岗位，待命行动。就拿上海资本家来说，如果他真是爱国的分子，如果他真是守法的分子，如果他虽然是犯了法但确系愿悔过的分子，也应该拥护“五反”并踊跃参加，这也是可以预料的，这
    一点我们让上海资产阶级自己选择。
    我应该向大家指出：人民政府对违法的资本家采取这样的政策，并不意味着人民政府对资产阶级的政策已经改变了，或者说人民民主专政已经改变成三个阶级的联盟了。这是完全不对的，完全不是这样一回事。团结资产阶级的政策并未改变，中国人民民主专政仍然是中国工人阶级、农民阶级、城市小资产阶级、资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子在工人阶级和共产党领导之下的人民民主统一战线的政权。“五反”斗争并不同于土地改革斗争，如同消灭地主阶级一样来消灭资产阶级。“五反”斗争只是消灭资产阶级中间危害国计民生的那些坏事：即消灭行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报等罪恶行为。经过“五反”，消灭了
    “五毒”，才能使资产阶级在共同纲领和人民政府法令的范围内循规蹈矩地办事，才能使资产阶级老老实实地在工人阶级和国营经济的领导下，经营有利于国计民生的事业，使国家经济建设事业健康地向繁荣的道路发展，这就是“五反”运动的根本目的。例如“公私兼顾”政策，一定要在国营企业领导之下才能正确实现，这是共同纲领所规定了的，资产阶级企图否认和篡夺国营企业的领导，这就是犯法，一定要在“五反”运动中加以纠正。又如“劳资两利”政策，一定要在工人阶级领导之下才能正确实现，这也是共同纲领所规定了的，资产阶级历来加以曲解并借以打击工人阶级，这也是违法行为，也一定要在“五反”运动中加以纠正。因此，我们可以懂得“五反”运动是为了实现共同纲领，保证人民政府政策的贯彻，反对资产阶级不法分子的破坏。在“五反”以后，私营企业必须是既照顾资本家的利润和工厂的公积金，又照顾国家的税收和工人的福利，而再不允许只顾资本家一面利益，而不顾其他三面的利益。只有这样，共同纲领所规定的“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的正确政策才能够合理地实现。
    一切守法的以及过去虽然犯过法而现在已把问题交代清楚的资本家们，你们是用不着担心的；在新民主主义的整个时期内，是完全允许资产阶级合法存在的；你们经营合法事业，赚取合法利润，是完全允许的而且在政府保护之列；但是，违背共同纲领，向共产党和工人阶级发动猖狂的进攻，施行五毒，则是不允许的。
    有些不法资本家们，他们说，人民政府今天“五反”，明天就来个“七反”“八反”，今天反对资产阶级，明天就要反对小资产阶级了。这种宣传，是为了淆惑视听，扩大奸商们的队伍。但这是徒劳的。人民政府所规定的“五反”的内容和界限是很明确的。“五反”就是反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报，既不应该缩小它，也不应该扩大它。小额回扣不算做行贿，而只算做小毛病，当然小毛病也应该纠正；被人敲诈勒索就叫被人敲诈勒索，也不能叫做行贿；偶尔失密，无意中谈及国家财经情况，这是应该反对和纠正的，但不能叫坐探，也不能算做盗窃国家经济情报。隐匿敌伪财产和逃汇套汇，这当然是盗窃国家资财的行为，必须反，但不要另列一项，这原来就是列在“五反”之内的。其他如关厂、停薪、停伙等，本市军管会已有明令禁止，可按照已发布的法令办理。
    有些不守法的资本家们，他们又说了，中央人民政府的政策是好的，可是上海是否会不折不扣地执行呢？或者说北京执行的很好，上海是否也会执行的很好呢？这也是恶意中伤，其目的在于抗拒“五反”。必须告诉大家，在毛主席和人民政府的领导下，全国只有一个政策，上海从来没有今后也不会有例外。我们根据政务院所批准公布的“北京市人民政府在‘五反’运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”，也同样大体把上海十六万三千四百户工商业（十一万户摊贩在外）分为五类：守法户，估计大约可占工商业总户数的百分之十五左右。基本守法户，估计大约可占工商业总户数的百分之五十左右；我们并拟放宽尺度，规定凡违法利得在一千万元以下并彻底坦白交代者，仍算做基本守法户。半守法半违法户，估计大约占工商业总户数的百分之三十左右；我们也拟放宽尺度，违法利得虽在一千万元以上，但如能彻底坦白、真诚悔过并积极检举他人而立功者，亦可算做基本守法户。严重违法户和完全违法户，估计不会超过工商业总户数的百分之五，其中罪大恶极、不办不足以平众愤的当然是极少数；就是罪恶很大如能彻底坦白、真诚悔过并积极检举他人而立功者，仍可酌予减轻。所有不守法的资本家，都可以在坦白与抗拒，宽大与严惩之间选择自己的道路。真诚坦白者，酌予减免；拒不坦白者，加重处罚。
    在“五反”运动开始以后，我们即将陆续根据政务院所批准公布的“北京市人民政府在‘五反’运动中关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”，采取资本家自报公评、工人店员集体审查、市区两级增产节约委员会批准的三道手续办理审查。逐级审查完毕后，才能分别定案，并发给处理通知书。这三道手续之中又以第二道手续（工人、店员的集体审查）为最重要。所有的资本家都要经过工人、店员的这种审查。如果工人、店员不通过，就不能给他们作出结论。
    上面我已经把人民政府关于“五反”的方针和政策讲清楚了，上海的资产阶级应该起来选择自己的出路。我认为他们应该拥护上述的正确的“五反”政策。应该老老实实在人民面前交清自己的“五毒”罪行。老老实实服从人民的检查和人民政府的处理。在处理之后，保证今后不重犯而老老实实地参加国家经济建设，尽自己的本分，取得合法利润，这个前途确实是非常光明的。贯彻“五反”对于资产阶级是有利的，这个道理也是很清楚的。我想上海资产阶级的大多数一定会选择坦白和彻底交代问题这一条路。但由于我们与上海资产阶级接触有三年之久，深知其中有好人也有坏人；更深知其中有一部分人确实作风很坏，遇事兴风作浪，他们正企图否认事实，硬要抗拒“五反”，他们把人民政府的从宽处理当成示弱；他们以为人民政府不敢动他们，因而拒不坦白。这种反抗“五反”，反抗人民政府的态度，是不能容许的，人民政府定要严办这些坏分子，广大市民一定拥护严办他们也是不成问题的。
    工人们、店员们和职员们！你们是“五反”统一战线的主体。你们应站稳工人阶级的立场，跟资本家分清界限。你们多年与资产阶级相处，你们深知资产阶级内部情形，只要你们一讲话，资产阶级逃避“五反”的计划必遭完全的失败。资产阶级平日是看不起工人的，现在他们为了逃避“五反”，突然卑躬屈节向工人讨情并进行新的贿赂，你们要识破资产阶级的阴谋，检举不法资本家，争取“五反”斗争的彻底胜利。
    高级职员们和老年店员们！你们对资本家的不法行为比一般工人知道得更清楚些。不法资本家许多“五毒”首尾，都是你们经手办的。可能在资本家行贿、偷税漏税、偷工减料等不法行为上，你们也沾了一点边。这些资本家便以此威吓你们说：“你们五毒既沾了边，如讲了秘密，政府将不宽恕，一定将你们连同办罪。”不法资产阶级一面造谣挑拨，一面又对你们进行贿赂。你们要识破不法资本家这种卑鄙龌龊的新阴谋，你们要勇敢检举不法资本家，抛弃“攻守同盟”。你们勇敢回到工人阶级的队伍里来，在“五反”中立功改造和提高自己，人民政府不但可以不究既往，而且对你们的“五反”贡献将有奖励。
    守法的、基本守法的和半守法的工商户们！在你们彻底坦白把你们自己的问题交代清楚以后，应该积极地检举严重违法户和完全违法户的不法行为，并劝说他们彻底坦白，你们这样做，如果有成绩有贡献，将视成绩与贡献的大小获得鼓励与奖励。
    严重违法和完全违法的资本家们！你们是犯法的。你们将要受到国家的制裁，但如果你们能彻底坦白，真诚悔过并积极检举其他违法的资本家而立了功，仍可以酌情减轻你们的处分。
    全上海的市民们！上海的“五反”应该有组织有计划地去进行，“五反”应彻底做好，但要“反”而不乱，对一切工商户的检查，只有市、区增产节约委员会才有决定检查之权，任何冒名进入工商户进行检查者以盗窃论罪，并准许工商户和居民申报，由公安局查明立即逮捕法办。各检查队规定有公文证件，证明无误才可开始检查。一切检查队应遵守规定的检查纪律，不得假公济私，不准侵犯工商户的合法权益。在“五反”斗争中，全市的工商业应照常营业照常生产。“五反”检查在上海全市分步骤来进行，列入检查的工商户，应尊重检查队的领导，交代问题，尚未列入检查的工商户，应照常营业听候检查，不要自相惊扰。如有不法之徒造谣生事破坏“五反”，一定严惩不贷。“五反”斗争必须有组织有计划有步骤地去进行，对工商业的正常活动与经营不要加以妨碍，这样的要求是完全必要的，希望全体市民们一致遵守。
    全上海轰轰烈烈的“五反”斗争正式展开了。我相信：我们有毛主席的英明领导，有正确的方针和政策，有广泛的“五反”统一战线，我们一定能够在这一伟大斗争中以胜利者的资格走出来，彻底地打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，做到生产发展、经济繁荣和市场活跃，为我国大规模的有计划的经济建设铺好道路。    （新华社）
