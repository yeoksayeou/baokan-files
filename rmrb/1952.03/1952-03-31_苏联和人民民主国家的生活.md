    The Largest Metallurgical Plant in Czechoslovakia - "Huko" Metallurgical Plant
    Near Kosice in eastern Czechoslovakia, the working people of Czechoslovakia are building a huge integrated metallurgical plant. Thousands of diligent hands are erecting building supports, stacking rows of brick walls, laying railways and installing water pipes, drawing pictures and measuring foundations; everywhere you can hear the exciting sounds of labor.
    This metallurgical plant is the "Huko" Metallurgical Plant, which is about to become the largest metallurgical plant in Czechoslovakia. Its blast furnace will begin producing pig iron in 1953, and from 1955, it will produce millions of tons of steel every year. Comrade Ďuriš, the former Minister of National Planning of Czechoslovakia, explained the importance of this metallurgical plant at the February 1951 meeting of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party: "After this metallurgical plant is completed, Slovakia's steel production per capita will exceed that of the United Kingdom, and Czechoslovakia's steel production will therefore jump to sixth place in the world."
    The scale of the "Huko" Metallurgical Plant can be seen from the following statistics: At the beginning of construction, a long train full of building materials and steel parts needed to be transported every hour, and by the time the construction is near completion, the same train must arrive every half hour. The metallurgical plant's station will be equipped with the latest unloading machines, unloading one thousand tons per hour.
    To build this metallurgical plant, which covers an area of one thousand hectares, three million cubic meters of earth must be excavated and transported, more than one million cubic meters of cement and reinforced concrete must be used, five hundred thousand cubic meters of walls must be built, and five hundred boxcars of steel must be transported to the construction site and erected. The entire "Huko" Metallurgical Plant project requires sixty million work hours.
    The industrial equipment of the "Huko" Metallurgical Plant is completely commensurate with its scale. The blast furnace in the factory is the largest in Europe outside of the Soviet Union. The products produced by the largest blast furnace in the factory must be transported by sixteen to twenty trucks. By 1955, "Huko" will be fully operational, producing one million tons of steel annually. With these steels, people can build a railway that circles the moon once.
    The workers building the "Huko" Metallurgical Plant have never built such a large-scale project before. Therefore, to complete this huge construction plan, we must rely on the help of Soviet workers and experts. For example, water pipes with a diameter of 300 cm must be installed 14 meters underground. The project to install these water pipes requires the tunnel method and installation with Soviet tunnel liners - the Moscow subway was built using this method. The Soviet Union also supplied some tractors, excavators and cranes for the construction project.
    The project of carrying out this huge socialist construction is a source of pride and glory for every Czechoslovakian. Skilled workers and short-term voluntary laborers go to the construction site from eastern Slovakia and other parts of Czechoslovakia. 40,000 adult residents of Kosice have made a collective guarantee to work one million hours on the "Huko" Metallurgical Plant construction site. In accordance with the instructions of President Gottwald, a socialist city will also be built next to the "Huko" Metallurgical Plant, on the wasteland that was originally only trees and grass. The offices of local governments and other people's organizations will be built in the central area of ​​the city, next to "Labor Team Avenue", which is fifty meters wide, with trees and stone statues of labor models on both sides. Directly in front of the city center will be built a monument to President Gottwald, who is loved by the Czechoslovak people.
    The worker dormitories of the "Huko" Metallurgical Plant have modern facilities: heating, hot water, kitchens equipped with gas stoves or electric stoves, etc. Every forty to fifty dormitories has a public electric laundry room, saving women from unnecessary heavy work. Vegetable gardens and greenhouses outside the city supply the city's residents with fresh vegetables, fruits and flowers. On a small hill overlooking the entire city, a statue of Stalin will be built, expressing the love and gratitude of the Czechoslovakian working people for Stalin, the standard-bearer of peace.
    Soon, hundreds of thousands of tons of steel produced by the "Huko" Metallurgical Plant will be made into generators, steam turbines, machine tools, textile machines, presses and various engines in the highly developed Czech machine manufacturing industry. The huge "Huko" Metallurgical Plant will not only strengthen Czechoslovakia's national defense forces and make Czechoslovakia's entire national economy develop more rapidly, but will also help other people's democratic countries accelerate industrial construction.

    捷克斯洛伐克最大的冶炼厂—“胡科”冶炼厂
    在捷克斯洛伐克东部柯西兹地方的附近，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民正在建设一个巨大的联合冶炼厂。数千双勤劳的手正在竖立起建筑物的支架，堆砌一排排的砖墙，铺设铁路和按装水管，画图和测量地基；这里到处可以听见令人兴奋的劳动的声音。
    这个冶炼厂就是即将成为捷克斯洛伐克最大冶炼厂的“胡科”冶炼厂。它的鼓风炉将在一九五三年开始出产生铁，而从一九五五年起，它每年将出产成百万吨的钢。捷克斯洛伐克前国家计划部部长杜兰斯基同志在捷共中央一九五一年二月会议上曾经说明了这个冶炼厂的重要性：“这个冶炼厂完成之后，斯洛伐克钢的产量以每一人口计算，将超过英国，而捷克斯洛伐克钢的产量则将因此而跃居于全世界的第六位。”
    “胡科”冶炼厂的规模之大，可以从下面的统计看出来：在建筑开始的时候，每一小时就需要运来
    一长列满载着建筑材料和钢铁零件的火车，而到建筑快完成的时候，则每半小时就得有同样的火车开来。冶炼厂的车站将设有最新式的卸货机，每小时卸货一千吨。
    建筑这个占地一千公顷的冶炼厂必须挖掘和搬运三百万土方，要用一百万立方公尺以上的水泥和钢骨水泥，要建筑五十万立方公尺的墙壁，要把五百车皮的钢料运到工地并建筑起来。整个“胡科”冶炼厂的工程需要六千万个工作小时。
    “胡科”冶炼厂的工业设备完全和它的规模相衬。厂里的鼓风炉除了苏联以外是欧洲最大的。厂里最大一个鼓风炉出产的产品必须用十六至二十辆的货车装运。到一九五五年时，“胡科”就将全部开工，每年出产一百万吨钢。用这些钢材，人们可以造一条环绕月球一周的铁路。
    建筑“胡科”冶炼厂的工人们，还没有建筑过这样大规模工程的经验。因此要完成这个巨大的建设计划就必须依靠苏联工人和专家的帮助。例如，直径三百公分的水管必须按装在十四公尺深的地下，这个按装水管的工程需要采用隧道法，并用苏联的隧道衬筒进行按装——莫斯科的地下铁道就是用这个方法建筑的。苏联并且供给了建筑工程应用的一些拖拉机、挖土机和起重机。
    进行这个巨大的社会主义建设的工程，是每一个捷克斯洛伐克的人民引为骄傲与光荣的。技术工人和短期义务劳动者从斯洛伐克东部和捷克斯洛伐克其他地方到工地去。柯西兹城的四万成年居民已经提出了集体保证，要在“胡科”冶炼厂的工地上工作一百万小时。遵照哥特瓦尔德总统的指示，还要在“胡科”冶炼厂旁边，原来只有树木和草丛的野地上建立起一座社会主义城市来。地方政府和其他人民团体的办公室将建筑在城市的中心区，旁边是宽达五十公尺的“劳动队大街”，两旁有树木和劳动模范们的石像。在城中心区的正前方，将建立一座被捷克斯洛伐克人民所热爱的哥特瓦尔德总统的纪念像。
    “胡科”冶炼厂的工人宿舍具有现代化的设备：暖气、热水、装有煤气炉灶或电灶的厨房等。每四五十所宿舍有一座公共的电气洗衣房，给妇女们省去多余的繁重工作。设在城外的菜园和暖房供给城内居民以新鲜的蔬菜、水果和花卉，在一座可以了望全城的小山上，将修建一座斯大林的纪念像，表示捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民对于和平旗手斯大林的热爱和感谢。
    不久以后，“胡科”冶炼厂生产出来的数十万吨钢铁，将在高度发展的捷克机器制造工业中制成发电机、蒸汽透平、工作母机、纺织机器、压力机和各种发动机。巨大的“胡科”冶炼厂不但将增强捷克斯洛伐克的国防力量，使捷克斯洛伐克的整个国民经济更加迅速向前发展，而且也将帮助其他人民民主国家加速工业建设。
