    Some Capitalists in Shijiazhuang Still Use Feudal Contracts to Bind Apprentices

    To the Editor: Some capitalists in Shijiazhuang are still forcing apprentices to sign feudal contracts. Taking a barber shop's contract as an example, it contains phrases like: "So-and-so is willing to become an apprentice under so-and-so (the capitalist) for a term of four years. After this, the capitalist is not responsible if the apprentice commits suicide by jumping into a well or river, running away, or taking poison." After forcing apprentices to sign such contracts, the capitalists unscrupulously exploit them. They beat and scold apprentices at will, deduct wages, and restrict apprentices from participating in trade union activities. Some capitalists, fearing that apprentices cannot stand the abuse and quit midway, stipulate in the contract: "If you quit midway, you will be charged rice per day." Zhongshan Barber Shop charges two catties of rice per day, and Dazhong Barber Shop charges nine catties of rice per day. After signing this kind of contract, the apprentice can no longer escape the shackles of capitalist exploitation. I suggest that relevant departments should thoroughly investigate and correct this illegal behavior of capitalists.　Li Feng

    石家庄市某些商店的资方
    仍用封建契约束缚学徒
    编辑同志：石家庄市有些商店的资方，现在还强迫学徒订立封建性的契约。以理发业的一份契约来说，其中有这样的话：“某人愿在某某（资方）门下为徒，学习期限四年。此后学徒如投井、跳河、逃跑、食毒，概与资方无关。”资方强迫学徒签订这种契约后，就有恃无恐地放胆剥削学徒。他们随意打骂学徒，克扣工资，还限制学徒参加工会活动。有的资方怕学徒不堪虐待，中途不干了，就在契约上规定：“中途不干，按日退米。”中山理发馆规定每日退米二斤，大中理发馆规定每日退米九斤。订了这种契约之后，学徒再也无法脱离资本家剥削的枷锁了。我建议有关部门应彻底检查并纠正资方这种违法行为。　黎风
