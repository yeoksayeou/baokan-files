Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The US-Japan "Administrative Agreement’s" clauses, which blatantly infringe upon Japan’s independent sovereignty, have aroused opposition from people of all strata in Japan. The left wing of the Socialist Party and other bourgeois parties also issued statements on the 26th, opposing the "Administrative Agreement" and expressing concern about the United States using this agreement to push Japan onto the path of war.

The statement by the left wing of the Socialist Party pointed out: The "Administrative Agreement" makes the separate peace treaty with Japan and the US-Japan "Security Treaty," which undermine Japan's independence and peace, even more of a reality. The statement said: On the whole, the "Administrative Agreement" was not formulated by the US and Japan on an equal footing. Because of this agreement, all parts of Japan are becoming military bases to a greater extent than before, and half of Japan's industrial and mining equipment is placed under military control. The Socialist Party's left wing condemned the Yoshida government for secretly agreeing with the United States to treat important matters such as "states of emergency" as "matters of understanding" without making them public. It said: This measure by the Yoshida government is an "intolerable act of violating the constitution," and at the same time makes the Japanese people feel uneasy because the United States will in fact have the right to interfere in Japan's internal affairs. Regarding the provisions on extraterritoriality, "it gives people the impression that Japan is being treated as an affiliated state." The statement reiterated the party's position of abolishing the US-Japan "Security Treaty" and demanded that the "Administrative Agreement" be submitted to the Diet for deliberation. The statement pointed out: In order to completely eliminate the unrestricted extraterritorial rights of the US troops stationed in Japan, a resolute struggle must be launched.

The New Party – the Reform Party – which was recently formed with the Democratic Party as its center, condemned the Yoshida government for violating the constitution by not reporting to the Diet on the "Administrative Agreement" issue in advance. The party's statement said: The disguised extraterritoriality – "jurisdiction" – is a "servile and humiliating provision" that "excessively infringes upon national rights." The party was "extremely surprised" by the provisions regarding the so-called "state of emergency" which binds Japan to the American chariot and believes that this provision "creates a mood of anxiety."

The right wing of the Socialist Party also opposed the infringement of Japanese sovereignty and the basic human rights of the people by the provisions of the "Administrative Agreement" in its statement. The party believes that the so-called "jurisdiction" is essentially a "privilege of extraterritoriality" that "severely restricts" Japan's sovereignty. The statement also expressed opposition to the provisions regarding "states of emergency." The statement said: "This vague provision makes our country's sovereignty lose its independence in essence."

    日本社会党左派等发表声明
    反对美日“行政协定”
    【新华社二十九日讯】东京消息：美日“行政协定”的赤裸裸侵害日本独立主权的条款，已激起日本各阶层人民的反对。社会党左派和其他资产阶级政党也在二十六日纷纷发表声明，反对“行政协定”，并对美国利用这个协定把日本推上战争轨道表示忧虑。
    社会党左派的声明指出：“行政协定”使破坏日本独立与和平的单独对日和约和美日“安全条约”变得更现实了。声明说：整个说来，“行政协定”不是由美日两国在平等的地位上制订的。由于这个协定，日本全国各地都比以前更进一步地军事基地化了，日本的工矿设备有一半置于军事管制之下。社会党左派斥责吉田政府与美国协议把所谓“紧急状态”等重要事项作为“谅解事项”秘而不宣。它说：吉田政府这一措施是“难以容忍的违反宪法的行为”，同时使日本国民因为美国事实上将有权干涉日本内政而感到不安。关于治外法权的规定，“使人有日本被作为附属国家的印象”。声明重申该党废除美日“安全条约”的主张，并要求将“行政协定”提交国会审议。声明指出：要彻底消除驻日美军的无限制的治外法权，必须展开坚决的斗争。
    最近以国民民主党为中心而成立的新党——改进党，谴责吉田政府违反宪法，没有在事先就“行政协定”问题向国会报告。该党的声明说：变相的治外法权——“审判权”是“奴役而屈辱的规定”，它“过分地侵害了国家权利”。该党对于把日本缚上美国战车的所谓“紧急状态”的规定，“极感惊讶”，并认为这种规定“形成人心不安的情绪”。
    社会党右派在声明中也反对以“行政协定”的规定来侵害日本主权和国民的基本人权。该党认为所谓“审判权”在实质上就是“治外法权性的特权”，使日本的主权“受有严重的限制”。声明并表示反对关于“紧急状态”的规定。声明说：“这种茫然的规定使我国的主权在实质上丧失独立性。”
