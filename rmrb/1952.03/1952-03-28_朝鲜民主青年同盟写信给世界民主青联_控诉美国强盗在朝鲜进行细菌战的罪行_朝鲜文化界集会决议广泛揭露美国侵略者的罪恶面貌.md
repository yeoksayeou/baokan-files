Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 27th: The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League wrote to the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth on March 15th, condemning the towering crime of American aggressor bandits conducting germ warfare in Korea, calling on peace-loving youth around the world to unanimously denounce it, demanding severe punishment for germ warfare criminals, and holding the US imperialists and their lackeys internationally responsible.

The letter said: After suffering shameful defeats militarily and politically, US imperialism deliberately delays the armistice negotiations that are unanimously hoped for by peace-loving people around the world, while at the same time constantly creating towering crimes. American bandits have turned peaceful Korean cities and villages into ashes, brutally trampling on all international law, and even using poison gas. The inhuman armed interventionists have recently begun to use, on a large scale on the Korean front and in the rear, the bacterial weapons they have long prepared. After expert analysis, it has been determined that the insects they spread carry terrible infectious germs such as plague, cholera, and typhus.

The letter also said: American bandits had already spread smallpox germs in Korea during the period from December 1950 to January 1951. Since then, the youth of all Korea have been vigilant about this atrocity by American bandits.

After exposing the crime of collusion between American aggressors and Japanese germ warfare criminals, the letter said: The entire Korean people and the entire Korean youth, closely united around our leader General Kim Il-sung, are effectively crushing the evil conspiracy of the aggressor bandits. We Korean youth know that the heinous crimes of the Wall Street monopolists and their mercenaries, who launch aggressive wars and brutally trample on international law, can only promote the further strengthening of the anti-imperialist struggle of peace-loving people and youth around the world. The denunciation of germ warfare criminals by members of the great Lenin Communist Youth League, our young comrades-in-arms in People's China, and peace-loving friends in various people's democratic countries, as well as the actions of the brave youth in various capitalist countries who are fighting to refuse to go to the Korean battlefield, encourage us to fight the enemy more bravely.

The letter concluded: The Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League, entrusted by all the youth of Korea, calls on peace-loving youth around the world to severely denounce the crime of American aggressors using bacterial weapons against the Korean people, and demands severe punishment for germ warfare criminals who have planned to use bacterial weapons and hold the US imperialists and their lackeys internationally responsible.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 27th: Education, culture, and art workers in various parts of the Korean rear continue to hold meetings to protest and denounce the towering crime of American aggressors conducting germ warfare. They unanimously stated that while actively carrying out the anti-epidemic struggle, they will make full use of cultural and educational tools and various art forms to more forcefully expose the evil face of the aggressors and widely call on all the people to fight to the end to crush the enemy's heinous germ warfare. At the protest meeting of all education, culture, and art workers in Kanggye City, Jagang Province, on the 22nd, many teachers, writers, and artists, in their speeches, indignantly demanded severe punishment for the germ warfare criminals who spread insects carrying germs in large quantities in Korea and China, and expressed their determination to crush the enemy's germ warfare with practical actions. The meeting unanimously passed a protest letter, calling on all education, culture, and art workers in North Korea to thoroughly expose the insidious conspiracy of the American aggressors and deal a heavier blow to the aggressors.

    控诉美国强盗在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行
    朝鲜文化界集会决议广泛揭露美国侵略者的罪恶面貌
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会在三月十五日写信给世界民主青年联盟执行委员会，控诉美国侵略强盗在朝鲜进行细菌战的滔天罪行，号召全世界爱好和平的青年一致予以声讨，要求严惩细菌战犯，并追究美帝国主义及其走狗的国际责任。
    该信说：美帝国主义在军事上、政治上连遭可耻的失败之后，故意拖延全世界爱好和平人民所一致期待着的停战谈判，同时更不断地制造着滔天罪行。美国强盗使朝鲜的和平城市与农村变成灰烬，凶暴地蹂躏着一切国际公法，甚至使用了毒气。丧尽人性的武装干涉者，最近更在朝鲜前线和后方开始大量地使用了它们准备已久的细菌武器。经专家们化验的结果，业已判明它们撒布的昆虫带有鼠疫、霍乱、斑疹伤寒等可怕的传染病菌。
    该信又说：美国强盗早在一九五零年十二月到一九五一年一月的期间，就曾在朝鲜撒布过天花病菌。从那时起，全朝鲜青年就对美国强盗的这种暴行提高了警惕。
    该信在揭露了美国侵略者和日本细菌战犯相勾结的罪行后说：紧密地团结在我们领袖金日成将军周围的全朝鲜人民和全朝鲜青年，正在有效地粉碎着侵略强盗的罪恶阴谋。我们朝鲜青年知道，发动侵略战争并横暴地蹂躏国际公法的华尔街垄断资本家及其雇佣兵的万恶罪行，只能促使全世界爱好和平人民和青年的反帝斗争进一步加强。伟大的列宁共产主义青年团团员、人民中国的青年战友和各人民民主国家爱好和平的朋友们对细菌战犯的声讨，以及为拒绝到朝鲜战场而斗争的勇敢的各资本主义国家青年的行动，鼓舞我们更勇敢地和敌人斗争。
    该信最后说：朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会受到全朝鲜青年的委托，号召全世界爱好和平的青年严厉地声讨美国侵略者对朝鲜人民使用细菌武器的罪行，并要求严惩有计划地使用细菌武器的细菌战犯，追究美帝国主义及其走狗的国际责任。
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜后方各地的教育、文化、艺术工作者继续举行集会，抗议和声讨美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行。他们一致表示要在积极展开防疫斗争的同时，充分利用文化教育工具和各种艺术形式，更有力地揭露侵略者的罪恶面貌，广泛号召全体人民为粉碎敌人万恶的细菌战而斗争到底。在二十二日举行的慈江道江界市全体教育、文化、艺术工作者的抗议大会上，许多教师、作家和艺术家在发言中，都激愤地要求严惩在朝鲜和中国大量撒布带有细菌的昆虫的细菌战犯，并表示要以实际行动来粉碎敌人的细菌战。大会并一致通过抗议书，号召全朝鲜的教育、文化、艺术工作者彻底揭露美国侵略者的险恶阴谋，更沉重地打击侵略者。
