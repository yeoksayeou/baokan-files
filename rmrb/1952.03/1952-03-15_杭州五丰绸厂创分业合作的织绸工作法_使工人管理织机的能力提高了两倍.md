The Hangzhou Public-Operated Wufeng Silk Factory, under the leadership of factory director Tang Chi, in collaboration with the factory's workers and technical personnel, has created a cooperative weaving method that doubles the workers' loom management capacity. Previously, a worker could only manage one loom. Using this new method, four people can collectively manage twelve looms.

Currently, across various locations, processes such as warp arrangement and weft thread replacement are generally done manually. In a ten-hour workday, a worker's actual hands-on operation time is only three to five hours. However, due to the high-quality requirements of silk, if a worker simultaneously manages two or more looms, they can easily become overwhelmed, affecting the quality of the fabric. Therefore, silk factories generally assign one worker to one loom. In Hangzhou, it is common for every three to four looms to be equipped with an assistant specifically for arranging the warp threads.

The new method involves a team jointly managing multiple looms. Its main content is to divide the weaving work into four categories: inspection, arrangement, warp separation, and machine repair, each handled by a separate worker. The inspection worker is primarily responsible for checking the quality of the fabric and issuing signals to instruct the entire group's work. The arrangement worker is mainly responsible for changing shuttles, changing pirns, and mending broken threads. The warp separation worker is mainly responsible for arranging the warp threads. The machine repair worker is mainly responsible for inspecting and repairing the machines. The four workers elect one person to serve as the team leader. During work, the four people follow a certain route, patrolling back and forth around the twelve looms arranged as a group. If anyone discovers a fault that is not within their job scope, they handle it themselves if they can without affecting their own work. Otherwise, they turn on signal lights of different colors (red, blue, white, etc.) installed on the upper end of the loom, according to the nature of the fault, and move the pointer on the "fault indicator board" next to the loom to indicate the type and location of the fault, notifying other workers to handle it. If several looms experience faults simultaneously, and the original worker is unable to handle them in time, the inspection worker will issue an emergency signal, concentrating the entire group's workers to eliminate the fault in order to reduce downtime. After implementing this method, each loom can be inspected by the inspection worker on average once per minute. Any weaving flaws on the fabric produced during this time (approximately one inch long) can be detected and remedied in a timely manner, preventing them from becoming defective products.

The characteristic of this new method is the combined application of the monitoring management method, the patrol management method, and the call management method, which turns non-productive time into productive time. After adopting the above new method, silk factories that originally operated one shift (ten hours) can switch to operating three shifts (eight hours each) without increasing workers or machines. This can greatly reduce production costs.

The Wufeng Silk Factory first successfully tested this new method in May 1950. In August 1951, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government Industry Department officially approved the design and initial experiment report of this method and instructed the Zhejiang Silk Weaving and Dyeing United Factory Preparatory Office to conduct a special experiment. In December of the same year, the Industry Department, together with representatives from the Zhejiang Provincial and Hangzhou Municipal Trade Unions, the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the China Textile Workers' Union, and twenty-six advanced silk weaving workers and technical personnel from Hangzhou and Huzhou, organized a measurement team to conduct a measurement. The measurement reaffirmed this method while pointing out some shortcomings in the division of labor. Currently, the Zhejiang Silk Weaving and Dyeing United Factory is further improving the method based on the opinions of the measurement team. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 杭州五丰绸厂创分业合作的织绸工作法  使工人管理织机的能力提高了两倍

    杭州五丰绸厂创分业合作的织绸工作法
    使工人管理织机的能力提高了两倍
    杭州市公营五丰绸厂厂长汤池和该厂工人、技术人员共同创造了一种分业合作的织绸工作法，使工人管理织机的能力提高两倍。原来一个工人只能管理一台织机，采用这种工作法，四个人可以共同管理十二台织机。
    目前各地织绸，整理经线和换纬线等一般还是用手工。一个工人在每天十小时工作中，实际动手操作的时间只有三小时到五小时，但由于绸缎的品质要求很高，如果一个工人同时管理两台或两台以上的织机，就容易顾此失彼，影响织物的品质，因此各地绸厂还都是一个工人看一台织机。杭州市一般绸厂，每三至四台织机又另配备一名帮机，专门整理经线。
    新工作法是一个小组共同管理多台织机。它的主要内容是把织绸工作划分为检查、整理、分经、机修四类，由四个工人分别担任。检查工人主要负责检查织物的品质，发布指示全组工人工作的讯号；整理工人主要负责换梭、换纾、补断头；分经工人主要负责整理经线；机修工人主要负责检查和修理机器。四人互选一人担任小组长。工作时，四人按照一定的路线，分别在排列成为一组的十二台织机前后巡回工作。任何一人发现不属于自己职务范围的故障时，如果自己能处理，又不致影响本身工作，便自己处理，否则便按照故障的性质，打开安装在织机上端的红、蓝、白等不同颜色的讯号灯，并拨动织机旁边“故障指示牌”上的指针，指明故障的类别和发生的位置，通知其他工人来做。如果几部织机同时发生故障，原来负责的工人来不及处理，便由检查工人发布紧急讯号，集中全组工人消灭这一故障，以减少停车时间。实行这一工作法后，每台织机平均在一分钟内可以受到检查工人检查一次，在这段时间织出的织物（约长一寸）上如有织疵，可以被及时发觉和补救，不致成为次货。
    这种新工作法的特点是监视管理法、巡回管理法、召换管理法的结合运用，使非生产时间变成为生产时间。采用以上新工作法后，原来每天开一班
    （十小时）的绸厂，不用增加工人和机器，就可以改开三班（每班八小时）。这样就可以大大降低生产成本。
    五丰绸厂在一九五○年五月初次试验这种新工作法成功。一九五一年八月，浙江省人民政府工业厅正式批准这项工作法的设计和首次实验报告，并责成浙江丝织染联合工厂筹备处专门进行实验。同年十二月，工业厅会同浙江省和杭州市总工会、中国纺织工会杭州市委员会等单位的代表，以及杭州和湖州两地的先进织绸工人、技术人员共二十六人组织测定小组，进行了一次测定。测定再次肯定了这一工作法，同时指出了分工方面的一些缺点。目前，浙江省丝织染联合工厂正根据测定小组的意见，进一步进行改进。　　　　　　　（新华社）
