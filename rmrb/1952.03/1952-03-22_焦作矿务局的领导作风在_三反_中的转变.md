    In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the bureaucratic style of many leading cadres has been severely criticized by the masses, and a new leadership style is growing. Recently, I visited Qian Chuhang, Director of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau. He had just come to Beijing from the front line of the anti-corruption struggle. When talking about future production, he was full of optimism. He told me that the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau had overfulfilled the production increase and economy plan for January and February in the anti-corruption struggle. January exceeded the plan by 1.24 percent, and February exceeded the plan by 7.53 percent. At the same time, fatal and serious injuries were eliminated. Minor injuries were also greatly reduced: 25 minor injuries in January (a decrease of 7.5 percent compared to December of last year), and further reduced to 15 in February. This is exciting news. At the planning meeting held by the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry last December, many leaders of the coal mine management bureaus were skeptical about the production increase and economy plan of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau. Some said that the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau was exaggerating and boasting; others asked: "Can your plan be completed at all?" The production increase and economy plan of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau this year is indeed very large. The planned output for this year is 80 percent higher than the actual output in 1951. Therefore, Comrade Qian Chuhang also said: "Although we accepted the task through mass discussion on the basis of criticizing conservative ideas and departmentalism; however, we were not absolutely certain whether it could be completed at that time." Can it be completed now? He said with confidence: "Yes, we are confident! At the very least, it will be completed according to the plan, I dare guarantee it!"

    He talked about some touching new atmospheres in the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau during the anti-corruption movement. These new atmospheres made people deeply believe that they were fully confident of successfully completing the arduous and glorious task assigned to them by the state.

    Where is the key to completing the task? Director Qian Chuhang said: "Resolutely rely on the masses and give full play to the role of grassroots cadres." At first glance, this is old news. Which leading cadre of our enterprises does not say these two sentences when talking about enterprise management? Qian Chuhang answered this question, he said: "In the past, we often talked about relying on the working masses, but we were still hampered by bureaucratic ideas. We only believed in the leadership and believed in the cadres, but we didn't believe in the masses very much. When we encountered problems in our work, we only consulted with the cadres. When we had tasks, we would assign them to the masses. The leaders of the Party organization and the trade union also made reports to the masses; however, we rarely let the masses speak and rarely listened to the voices of the masses. As a result, the task was not completed. When the leading cadres criticized the masses, the masses did not say anything, but they were not convinced in their hearts. They felt that if the problems in production were not solved, simply giving tasks was bureaucracy. When we heard that we had bureaucracy, we still felt wronged in our hearts. In the past, we always felt that we had made so many reports to the masses and carried out so much mobilization work when assigning tasks, wasn't that relying on the masses? We neither ate our fill all day long and put on bureaucratic airs, nor did we force orders, and we explained many great principles and small principles to the masses, how could it be considered bureaucracy?" This formalistic leadership method of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau was criticized in the mass movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy under the leadership of higher authorities. Last December, with the direct help of Chen Yu, Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the leading cadres of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau relied on the strength of the masses to thoroughly liquidate their conservative ideas and began to truly realize the greatness of the strength of the working masses and appreciate the importance of relying on the masses. As the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, the leading cadres made a preliminary self-criticism in front of the masses about the various wastes caused by the bureaucracy of the leadership. The broad masses of employees also exposed many serious corruption and waste phenomena and the bureaucratic style of leading cadres. For example, in the departments of the procurement team, material warehouse, lumber factory, and general affairs section under the management section, corruption was extremely widespread. Gao Qingshan, the leader of the procurement team, privately misappropriated public funds to lend to private merchants for speculative business, which has been verified to be more than 400 million yuan. The acceptance personnel of the material warehouse, due to being bribed by private merchants, accepted a large number of materials (wood, gunpowder, electrical materials, etc.) that did not meet the specifications, causing great losses to production. In terms of waste, the losses caused by poor engineering design, blind construction, and lax production management were also very large. For example, the installation of electric saws in the No. 39 mine, because it was not well designed, was rarely used after installation, and then dismantled and moved to other places, wasting more than 80 million yuan. The wooden pillars transported from the Northeast were mostly rotten and deteriorated because the management department did not remove the bark of the wooden pillars in time, resulting in a loss of more than 30 million yuan. In the past, someone had reported Gao Qingshan for corruption, but the leadership ignored it, and Tian Yuhu, the head of the management section, even thought that Gao Qingshan was a good cadre and promoted him to the leader of the procurement team. The masses criticized this section chief, saying:
    "He wears wooden glasses all day long (meaning he can't see anything). How can things not go wrong?" At this time, the leadership further realized that if they could have consulted with the masses more in the past and listened to the opinions of the masses more, many corruption and waste incidents could have been avoided. Gao Qingshan, the leader of the procurement team, was arrested and brought to justice by the People's Government, and the responsible cadres of some departments were dismissed. This not only did not hinder the progress of the work, but also greatly improved the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the employees. The leadership saw the strength of the masses, and decided to further rely on the masses to carry out the anti-corruption movement and conduct production, while also letting go and giving play to the strength of grassroots cadres. The leading ideology was clarified, and the policy of relying on the masses was truly implemented in the work; the practice of the masses greatly educated the leading cadres, making them more clearly realize the harm to the work caused by the disconnection between the leadership and the masses in the past, and initially learned some specific methods of relying on the masses. Here, Qian Chuhang cited several obvious examples.

    When leading cadres asked grassroots cadres to be responsible for solving problems in production, grassroots cadres put forward their opinions to the leadership: "If you want us to be responsible for production, you have to give us time." Originally, in the past, the spare time of the workers was occupied by the leading comrades of various systems to hold meetings. In these meetings, the leading cadres always talked about sets of principles, and rarely solved practical problems. The workers were not interested in such meetings. They said: "All they talk about are principles, they just don't like to talk about production matters. We remember very little of what we hear, and we forget it quickly." During the meetings, some workers dozed off, and some went out for a stroll under the pretext of relieving themselves. Now, the situation has changed. Before going to work and after getting off work, the classrooms of the spare-time schools at the pit entrances are always crowded, and the district heads lead the workers in their respective work areas in meetings. These meetings are very lively, and the workers vie to speak and launch criticisms. This one says that the supply of materials is not keeping up, delaying production, and the responsible cadres have to examine their bureaucracy; that one says that so-and-so is not energetic in production and is not cooperating well with others, and wants him to examine and correct himself. Many problems are immediately solved in the meetings; those that cannot be solved are submitted to the higher levels. The workers are very enthusiastic about participating in such meetings, because the time is short and they can solve practical problems. Some leading cadres of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau have been greatly inspired after participating in these meetings. Everyone deeply felt that political mobilization must be combined with solving specific difficulties, otherwise it will be divorced from the masses. The leading cadres of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau are working hard to implement this spirit of combining leadership with the masses. Now, when holding bureau meetings to study problems and summarize work, labor models, advanced producers, and worker representatives from important production departments are also invited to participate, and their opinions are listened to with an open mind. The workers concretely put forward the problems that urgently need to be solved in production and life at the meetings. These problems often lead the leading cadres to find the direction of progress in difficulties. For example, the speed of crossing faults in the Lifeng Mine was very slow in the past. The leading cadres thought that the efficiency of crossing faults could only be so high and could not be improved any further. However, the worker representatives who participated in the meeting proposed that the drainage capacity of the current pump cannot keep up with the tunneling; if the pump problem is solved, the efficiency can be improved. There are many such examples. Some problems that the leading cadres originally thought could not be solved; the workers talked about it, and found that many of these problems were caused by the failure of the material supply, the poor cooperation between the various types of work, or other unsuitable equipment. These problems can be solved with effort. Just as Qian Chuhang said: "In the past, if a task could not be completed, it could not be completed, and if a problem could not be solved, it could not be solved; now, when the workers express their opinions, we can know why it cannot be completed, why it cannot be solved, and how it can be completed and solved. In this way, we have touched the bottom, and we have a number in our minds, and naturally we have the confidence to complete the plan." Such meetings have further closely combined the leadership and the masses.

    Safety issues were originally the most troublesome issues for coal miners. In the past, the comrades in the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau who were responsible for safety work were always worried about accidents when they heard about increasing tasks. When the anti-corruption movement began, the amount of coal mining increased greatly compared to last year. Although there was a lot of gas underground, and accidents could easily occur, the cadres responsible for security work implemented the spirit of relying on the masses in their work, and there were no gas accidents, and minor injuries were also greatly reduced. Their method is to conduct a mass security inspection every ten days. In the past, there were also inspections for security work, but only a few mass representatives participated, and the inspections were always not detailed and in-depth enough. When this time the inspection work was handed over to the masses, the situation was different. The workers are most concerned about safety issues and are most able to find problems. They criticized the shortcomings without any hesitation; if they did not correct them after criticizing them, they would write articles and publish them in the small newspapers. In this way, the problems are naturally easy to solve. The head of the Security Section said: "This time, I have learned how to do security work. Working with the trade union, using small newspapers, and organizing mass inspections and supervision is the best way." The leading cadres of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau have deeply realized that mass inspection is one of the best ways to promote work. Qian Chuhang said that at the bureau meetings, he told the worker representatives that they were welcome to conduct strict supervision over them and to criticize the shortcomings at any time; if they did not correct them after criticizing them, they would publish them in the small newspapers; if they still did not correct them, they would write letters to the People's Daily. The leadership also strictly demanded the same from the workers. The leadership clearly told the masses about the tasks, and solved the difficulties in time; if the workers failed to complete the tasks, the leadership would also criticize them. The workers welcomed this method. In the past, the workers did not often give opinions to the leadership, and even less often gave opinions in person. Now a new situation has emerged. Qian Chuhang said happily that no matter where they were, when the workers had problems, they would raise them to the leading cadres when they met them and ask for solutions.

    After I visited Comrade Qian Chuhang and initially understood the main reasons why the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau overfulfilled its tasks, I deeply felt that a new leadership style is growing. This is a good start. If we maintain and develop this style well, the people's enterprises will advance even more by leaps and bounds.

    焦作矿务局的领导作风在“三反”中的转变
    宋琤
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，许多领导干部的官僚主义作风受到了群众严格的批判，新的领导作风正在成长着。最近，我访问了焦作矿务局的钱初航局长。他是新从反贪污斗争前线到北京来的。在谈到今后的生产时，他充满着乐观的情绪。他告诉我：焦作矿务局在反贪污斗争中超额完成了一、二月份增产节约计划，一月份超过计划百分之一点二四，二月份超过计划百分之七点五三。同时，消灭了死亡和重伤事故。轻微伤也大大减少：一月份轻微伤二十五人（较去年十二月减少百分之七点五），二月份又减少到十五人。这是一个令人兴奋的消息。在去年十二月，中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局召开的计划会议上，许多煤矿管理局的领导同志对焦作矿务局的增产节约计划都抱怀疑态度。有人说焦作矿务局是在说大话、吹牛；有人问：“你们的计划到底能不能完成？”焦作矿务局今年的增产节约计划的确是很大的，今年的计划产量比一九五一年的实产量提高了百分之八十。所以，钱初航同志也说：“虽然我们在批判了保守思想和本位主义的基础上，通过群众讨论，接受了任务；但是，到底能不能完成，当时确实也没有绝对的把握。”现在看能不能完成呢？他满怀信心地说：“可以，有把握！最低也是按计划完成，敢打保票！”
    他谈了焦作矿务局在反贪污运动中的一些感动人的新气象。这些新气象使人深信他们完全有把握胜利地完成国家交给他们的艰巨而光荣的任务。
    完成任务的关键在那里呢？钱初航局长说：“坚决依靠群众，充分发挥基层干部的作用。”乍一听来，这是老话，我们那一个企业的领导干部在谈到企业管理时不会讲这两句话呢？钱初航回答了这个问题，他说：“过去也常讲依靠工人群众，但是在思想上还是受着官僚主义的障碍，只相信领导，相信干部，而不大相信群众；在工作中遇到问题也就只找干部商量。有了任务，就向群众布置，党的组织和工会的领导干部也都向群众做报告；但是，却很少让群众讲话，很少听听群众的声音。结果，任务完不成。领导干部批评群众时，群众嘴里虽然不说，心里可并不服气。他们觉得，生产中的问题不解决，光给任务，就是官僚主义。当我们听到说我们有官僚主义时，心里还觉得冤枉。过去，我们总觉得向群众做了这样多报告，布置任务时做了这样多的动员工作，还不是依靠群众吗？我们既没有饱食终日摆官僚架子，又不强迫命令，大道理小道理向群众讲了很多，怎么能算官僚主义呢？”焦作矿务局这种形式主义的领导方法，在上级领导之下，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的群众运动中，受到了批判。去年十二月，在中央燃料工业部陈郁部长的直接帮助下，焦作矿务局领导干部依靠群众的力量，彻底地清算了自己的保守思想，并且开始真正认识到工人群众力量的伟大，体会到依靠群众的重要。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始，领导干部又在群众面前初步检讨了由于领导方面的官僚主义所造成的各种浪费。广大职工群众也揭发了许多严重的贪污浪费现象和领导干部的官僚主义作风。如经理科所属采购组、材料库、木料厂及总务股等部门，贪污现象极为普遍。采购组长高青山私自挪用公款借给私商作投机生意，已查明的就有四亿多元。材料库的验收人员，由于受了私商的贿赂，收进大批不合乎规格的材料（木材、炮药、电料等），造成生产上的极大损失。在浪费方面，因工程设计不周、盲目施工和生产管理不严造成的损失也很大。如三十九号矿井安装电锯，因为没有很好地设计，安装后很少使用，又拆卸移到别的地方，浪费八千多万元。由东北运来的木柱，因管理部门没有及时把木柱的皮剥掉，大部腐朽变质，损失三千多万元。过去曾有人检举高青山有贪污行为，但领导方面置之不理，经理科长田玉瑚还认为高青山是好干部，把他提拔为采购组长。群众批评这个科长说：
    “他整天戴着木头眼镜（即看不见东西的意思），什么事情搞不坏呢？”这时，领导方面才进一步觉察到，假使过去能多和群众商量，多倾听群众的意见，许多贪污浪费事件都是可以避免的。采购组长高青山被人民政府逮捕法办了，有的部门的负责干部被撤职了，这不但没有妨碍工作的进行，而且使职工群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性大为提高。领导方面看到了群众的力量，就决心进一步依靠群众开展反贪污运动和进行生产，同时放手发挥基层干部的力量。领导思想明确了，并且在工作中真正贯彻了依靠群众的方针；群众的实践又大大地教育了领导干部，使他们更清楚地认识到过去领导和群众脱节给予工作的危害，并且初步学会了依靠群众的一些具体办法。这里，钱初航举出了几个显明的例子。
    当领导干部要基层干部负责解决生产中的问题时，基层干部向领导方面提出了意见：“要我们负责生产得给我们时间。”原来，过去工人业余的时间，都被各系统的领导同志占去开会了。在这些会议上，总是领导干部讲一套一套的道理，很少解决实际问题。工人对这样的会议是不感兴趣的。他们说：“讲的净是道理，就是不爱讲生产上的事。我们听了记住的很少，忘得很快。”开会时，有的工人打磕睡，有的藉口大小便出去蹓跶蹓跶。现在，情况改变了。上班前，下班后，坑口的业余学校教室里人总是挤得满满的，区长们各自领着自己工作区内的工人在开会。这些会议开得很热闹，工人们争着发言，展开批评。这个说，材料供应不上，耽误了生产，负责的干部得检讨官僚主义；那个说某某人生产不起劲，和别人配合不好，要他检讨改正。许多问题在会议上随即得到解决；解决不了的就提交上级。工人们对参加这样的会议兴头很大，因为时间既短，又能解决实际问题。焦作矿务局的有些领导干部参加了这些会议后，得到了很大的启发。大家深深感到政治动员必须和解决具体困难结合起来，否则就要脱离群众。这种领导与群众结合的精神，焦作矿务局的领导干部正在努力贯彻。现在，在召开局务会议研究问题总结工作时，也要邀请劳动模范、先进生产者、重要生产部门的工人代表参加，并且虚心地倾听他们的意见。工人们在会议上具体地提出了生产中和生活中迫切需要解决的问题。这些问题常使领导干部在困难中找到前进的方向。比如，李封矿过断层的速度过去是很慢的，领导干部以为过断层的效率只能如此，无法再提高了。但是参加会议的过断层的工人代表却提出说：现在泵的排水能力赶不上掘进；泵的问题解决了，效率就能提高。这样的例子很多。有些问题领导干部原来认为无法解决；工人们一谈，发现其中许多问题发生的原因是材料供应不上，各工种间配合不好或是其他设备不合适。这些问题，经过努力，都是可以解决的。正像钱初航所谈的：“过去一个任务完成不了就是不能完成了，一个问题解决不了就是不能解决了；现在工人一发表意见，就可以知道为什么不能完成，为什么不能解决，怎么样才能完成，才能解决。这样，我们就摸着了底，心里有了数，自然就有了完成计划的信心。”这样的会议使得领导和群众进一步密切结合起来了。
    安全问题本来是煤矿工作者最感棘手的问题。过去，焦作矿务局负责安全工作的同志们，一听说增加任务，就提心吊胆地怕出事故。反贪污运动开始时，煤的开采量较去年大大增加了。虽然坑下瓦斯很多，很容易出事故，但是，由于负责保安工作的干部们在工作中贯彻了依靠群众的精神，始终没有出瓦斯事故，并且轻微伤也大大减少了。他们的办法是每十天进行一次群众性的保安检查。过去，保安工作也有检查，但只有少数群众代表参加，检查得总是不够细致深入的。当这一次把检查工作放手交给群众时，情况就不同了。工人们对安全问题最为关心，最能发现问题。他们对缺点毫无顾虑地提出批评；批评了不改正，就写稿子登在小报上。这样，问题自然就容易解决了。保安科长说：“这一次，我可学会怎样做保安工作了。和工会在一起，利用小报，组织群众性的检查监督，就是一个最好的办法。”焦作矿务局的领导干部们都深深地体会到群众性的检查是推动工作的最好办法之一。钱初航说，在局务会议上，他向工人代表们提出，欢迎工人对他们进行严格的监督，随时对缺点提出批评；假如批评了不改，就登小报；再不改，就写信给人民日报。领导方面也同样严格地要求工人。领导方面把任务明确地告诉群众，有困难及时解决；假如工人完不成任务，领导方面也要批评他们。工人们是欢迎这样的办法的。过去，工人们不常向领导方面提意见，更很少当面提意见。现在已经出现了新的情况。钱初航高兴地说，不论在那里，工人们有问题时，碰到领导干部就会向他们提出来，要求解决。
    当我访问了钱初航同志，初步地了解了焦作矿务局超额完成任务的主要原因后，我深深地感到，一种新的领导作风正在生长。这是一个良好的开端。好好保持和发展这种作风，人民企业将会更加大踏步地前进。
