    "Veterinary Epidemiology" Contains Serious Errors and Must Be Promptly Corrected

    Comrade Editor: "Veterinary Epidemiology," written by Wu Xinfa (first edition in early January 1951, sold by Wufu Medical Equipment Store, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Books and Equipment Department), is a book with serious political errors.

    In Chapter 3 of the book, the author states, "Laws and regulations can serve as our guiding principle." Subsequently, he copies numerous "laws and regulations" concerning the prevention and control of animal epidemics from the reactionary government. When discussing animal disease intelligence, he proposes, "Existing political organizations can be used, with... local... Lianbao chiefs and Baojia heads... as natural intelligence officers." This is truly absurd! Does it mean that the reactionary government's "laws and regulations" are also "our guiding principle"? Can we still "use" reactionary political organizations like Baojia heads, which have been destroyed by the people long ago? On page 83, when mentioning the transmission of equine glanders, the author states, "Our country's army often sells horses with infectious diseases to the people, causing great harm to the people's horses." The army referred to here is clearly the old reactionary army, but the author fails to clarify this, which is unacceptable.

    In short, the errors in "Veterinary Epidemiology" are extremely serious. In addition to the numerous errors mentioned above, the explanation of veterinary science also contains many fallacies. In order to clarify the adverse effects caused by these errors, I believe the author must promptly conduct a deep self-criticism.

### “兽医防疫学”有严重错误观点，必须迅速纠正

    “兽医防疫学”有严重错误观点，必须迅速纠正
    编辑同志：吴信法著的“兽医防疫学”（一九五一年一月初版，五福医疗器械行畜牧兽医图书药械部经售）是一本有严重政治错误的书。
    作者在该书第三章中说：“法令可为吾人之绳准”，接着他就抄录了许多反动政府关于兽疫防治的“法令”；他在讲到兽疫情报时主张：“可应用现有之政治机构，以……当地之……联保主任暨各保甲长……等为当然之情报员。”这真是太荒谬了！难道说反动政府的“法令”也是“吾人之绳准”？像保甲长这些反动的而且早已为人民摧毁的政治机构，还能为我们“应用”吗？在该书八十三页提到马鼻疽的传染时，作者说：“我国军队中常将有传染病之马售与民间，贻民马以大患”。这里所指的军队分明是旧日的反动军队，但作者却没有说明，这是不应该的。
    总之，“兽医防疫学”的错误是异常严重的。它除了有着上述的许多错误外，对于兽医科学的说明也颇多谬误。为了澄清这些错误所造成的恶劣影响，我认为作者必须迅速进行深刻检讨。
