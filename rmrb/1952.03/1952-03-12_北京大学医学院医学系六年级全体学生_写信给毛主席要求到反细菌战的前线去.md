Peking University Medical College, Department of Medicine, Sixth Grade Students Write to Chairman Mao Requesting to Go to the Anti-Bacterial Warfare Front

Respected Chairman Mao: The American aggressors are frantically continuing to use bacteriological weapons to invade our country's Northeast. Our anger can no longer be suppressed.

We have a clearer understanding that American imperialism is the most dangerous deadly enemy of all mankind. As the People's Daily pointed out: If the crimes that the American aggressors are inflicting on the Chinese and Korean people today are not stopped, they will be inflicted on peace-loving people all over the world tomorrow. In order to defend the happiness of the Chinese and Korean people and to safeguard the safety of the working people all over the world, we pledge to take concrete actions to smash the enemy's evil conspiracy.

Respected Chairman Mao, we are sixth-grade students of the Department of Medicine, Peking University Medical College—a class of students who are about to graduate, and are medical workers who have been painstakingly trained by the people of the motherland. Please allow us to go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare, to Korea or the Northeast. Where there are evil insects dropped by the enemy, we will go there. We have enough confidence and courage to complete the tasks assigned to us by the motherland and by you.

    写信给毛主席要求到反细菌战的前线去
    敬爱的毛主席：美国侵略者疯狂地继续使用细菌武器，侵犯我们祖国的东北。我们的愤怒再也不能抑止了。
    我们更清楚地认识到美帝国主义是全人类最危险的死敌。正如人民日报所指出的：美国侵略者今天加到中朝人民头上的罪行，如果不予制止明天就要加到全世界爱好和平的人民头上。为了保卫中朝人民的幸福，为了维护全世界劳动人民的安全，我们誓以具体的行动，粉碎敌人万恶的阴谋。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们是北京大学医学院医学系六年级——即将毕业的一班学生，是祖国人民辛苦培养的医务工作干部。请允许我们开赴反细菌战的最前线，到朝鲜或东北。那里有敌人抛下的罪恶的昆虫，我们就到那里去。我们有足够的信心和勇气来完成祖国和您所交给我们的任务。
    北京大学医学院医学系六年级学生汪秀明等共三十人
