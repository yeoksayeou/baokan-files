    Sanction the奸商 Peng Yuefan and others who harmed the Volunteer Army

    To the Editor: The奸商 Peng Yuefan and Zhang Mengshu of the Beijing Ruishenxiang Leather Goods Factory, by cutting corners and using inferior materials in the production of supplies for the Volunteer Army, are directly sabotaging the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Last year, these two奸商 undertook to make 4,948 medicine pouches for the Volunteer Army. The contract stipulated that each pouch should use seven chi eight cun five fen of leather, using good northern cowhide. However, the奸商 violated the regulations, using only six chi eight cun of leather for each pouch and substituting inferior leather for northern cowhide. They obtained exorbitant profits of over 180 million yuan from this order alone. When making saddles, they used 60% inferior leather instead of good cowhide; this batch of saddles was simply unusable. When making bits, they painted and oiled the bad leather to make it look like good leather, but it would break with a single fold. After making tarpaulins, they deliberately mixed the good and bad ones together to deceive the inspectors. After the anti-bribery movement began, they evaded the important issues and refused to confess their problems. I believe they should be sanctioned by the law.

    制裁暗害志愿军的奸商彭越凡等
    编辑同志：北京瑞生祥皮件工厂奸商彭越凡、张孟书，在承制志愿军用品中，偷工减料，直接破坏抗美援朝运动。去年，这两个奸商为志愿军承做药囊四千九百四十八个，合同上规定每个药囊用七尺八寸五分皮子，用好的北牛皮。但奸商违反规定，每个药囊只用六尺八寸，并用次等皮代替北牛皮。他们在这一项订货中获得暴利一亿八千多万元。做马鞍时，他们拿百分之六十的次皮顶好牛皮，这批马鞍根本就不能用。做马嚼子时，他们把坏皮子上面涂了色，抹上油，看起来像是好皮子，实际上一折就断。他们做好苫布后，故意把好的坏的放在一块，欺骗检查验货员。反行贿运动开始后，他们避重就轻，拒不交代问题。我认为他们应受到国法的制裁。    李光哲
