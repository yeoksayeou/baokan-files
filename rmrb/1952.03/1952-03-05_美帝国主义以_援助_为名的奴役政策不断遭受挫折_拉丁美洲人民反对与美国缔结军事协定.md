Xinhua News Agency dispatch, March 1st: According to TASS: The people of Latin American countries are fiercely opposing the secret negotiations between the United States and various Latin American governments for the conclusion of military agreements.

    In Chile, a protest movement against the conclusion of a military agreement with the United States is actively unfolding, and the people are demanding the expulsion of US military personnel. The National Youth Peace Council and the National Committee of the Chilean People's Front have recently issued statements, both strongly condemning the Chilean government's policy. In response to the call of the National Youth Peace Council, many youth organizations have joined the National Committee for Safeguarding Youth Rights and National Independence, established in Santiago, to jointly fight against war and against the enslavement of Chile by US imperialists. Diaz, the General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party, revealed the true nature of the Chilean government's secret military agreement negotiations with the United States, saying that the main purpose of US imperialism is to obtain methods to plunder Chile and implement military plans. Diaz pointed out: "US imperialism is busy preparing to open up new battlefields in order to escape the economic crisis. It has already suffered significant losses in Korea. The anti-war movement is growing in the United States. That is why it wants to use our soldiers."
    The Mexican people are widely protesting the recent military negotiations between Mexico and the United States. A group of prominent Mexican leaders have published statements in many newspapers, warning the Mexican people to pay attention to the United States' attempt to force Mexico to "adopt a war policy." The Mexican National Peace Council condemned the military negotiations, saying that they are "a threat to the free exercise of national sovereignty and to our country's development and progress."
    The Dominican People's Socialist Party issued a declaration entitled "Remove the Gringo Military Bases from the Dominican Republic!", denouncing the military agreement recently signed by the government of the Dominican Republic with the United States. The declaration condemns the military construction carried out by the United States in the Dominican Republic, saying that it "will virtually turn our country into a naval and air military base...for the use of the aggressive war that the US imperialists are frantically preparing." The declaration pointed out: "Our people oppose this heinous plan of using others as cannon fodder with anger."
    Even the Peruvian Congress has issued a statement opposing the US policy of enslaving Peru. Congressman Bournes condemned the US interference in Peru's internal affairs, saying: "We cannot accept an agreement that treats us as a colony of the gringos and forces us to accept it."
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch, March 1st: The United States' conspiracy to use so-called "aid" under the "Mutual Security Act" to buy off and enslave other countries to serve its aggressive plans has recently suffered repeated setbacks. Negotiations between the United States and its neighbor Mexico on military "aid" have recently failed again.
    During the negotiations between the United States and Mexico, the broad masses of the Mexican people launched a powerful protest movement against the conclusion of a military agreement with the United States. Even the "New York Times" had to admit that the Mexican people's movement against the conclusion of a military agreement with the United States was very successful. Under strong pressure from the people, the Mexican government announced on February 22 that the negotiations had broken down "without reaching any agreement" and stated that negotiations could not be resumed unless the United States withdrew certain conditions. Agence France-Presse revealed in a report of this news that the reason why the Mexican government had to interrupt the negotiations was that "the conditions put forward by the United States violated its (Mexico's) sovereignty." This infringement was so blatant that the Mexican government, fearing the fierce opposition of the people, did not dare to accept it rashly.
    Agence France-Presse also revealed that Mexico is already the seventh country that has "refused to accept the conditions stipulated by the US Congress in the foreign aid legislation." Similarly, due to the opposition of the people at home, the Iranian government has stated that it is not prepared to sign an agreement accepting US military "aid." In Burma and Indonesia, negotiations conducted by the United States in accordance with the "Mutual Security Act" have also encountered setbacks.
    The setbacks suffered by the US policy of enslaving the people of other countries in Mexico and other countries under the name of "aid" have greatly alarmed the US ruling clique. Agence France-Presse reported that "the decision announced yesterday (February 22) by Mexico to terminate negotiations with the United States on granting military aid has greatly surprised and caused considerable anxiety to Washington officials. ... US diplomats have begun to fear that the attitude adopted by these countries may become an unfortunate example for other US partners."

    美帝国主义以“援助”为名的奴役政策不断遭受挫折
    拉丁美洲人民反对与美国缔结军事协定
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社讯：拉丁美洲各国人民激烈反对美国和拉丁美洲各国政府间为缔结军事协定而举行的秘密谈判。
    在智利，反对与美国缔结军事协定的抗议运动积极展开，人民要求把美国军事人员驱逐出境。全国青年和平理事会、智利人民战线全国委员会最近先后发表声明，都坚决谴责智利政府的政策。为了响应全国青年和平理事会的号召，许多青年组织加入了在圣地亚哥成立的保障青年切身权利和国家独立全国委员会，共同进行反对战争、反对美帝国主义者奴役智利的斗争。智利共产党总书记迪亚斯揭露智利政府与美国的秘密军事协定谈判的真正性质说，美帝国主义的主要目的，在于获得掠夺智利和实行军事计划的方法。迪亚斯指出：“美帝国主义正在忙于准备开辟新战场，以便逃避经济危机。它在朝鲜已经受到重大的损失。反战运动在美国正在日益高涨。这就是它所以要利用我国士兵的缘故。”
    墨西哥人民普遍地抗议墨西哥与美国最近举行的军事谈判。墨西哥一批著名领袖曾在许多报纸上发表声明，警告墨西哥人民注意美国想强迫墨西哥
    “采取战争政策”的企图。墨西哥全国和平理事会谴责这个军事谈判说，这个军事谈判是“对自由执行国家主权以及对我国发展和进步的威胁。”
    多米尼加人民社会党以“撤除美国佬在多米尼加共和国内的军事基地！”为题发表宣言，斥责多米尼加共和国政府最近与美国签订的军事协定。宣言谴责说：美国在多米尼加进行军事建设，“实际上将把我国变成一个海空军事基地……以供美国帝国主义者正疯狂准备的侵略战争之用。”宣言指出：“我国人民以愤怒的心情反对这种借刀杀人的罪恶计划。”
    甚至秘鲁国会也发表声明，反对美国奴役秘鲁的政策。议员布尔尼斯谴责美国干涉秘鲁内政说：“我们不能接受把我们当做美国佬的殖民地而迫使我们接受的协定。”
    【新华社一日讯】美国利用所谓“共同安全法案”规定的“援助”来收买和奴役其他国家为其侵略计划服务的阴谋，最近接连遭受挫折。美国和它的近邻墨西哥之间关于军事“援助”的谈判最近又告失败。
    在美国和墨西哥举行谈判期间，墨西哥广大人民发动了强大的抗议运动，反对与美国缔结军事协定。连“纽约时报”也不得不承认，墨西哥人民这一反对与美国缔结军事协定的运动是很成功的。在人民的强大压力下，墨西哥政府在二月二十二日宣布谈判在“未达成任何协议”的情况下破裂，并表示除非美国撤消某些条件，谈判无法恢复。法新社在报道这个消息时透露，墨西哥政府所以不得不中断谈判，是因为“美国提出的条件侵犯它（墨西哥）的主权”。这种侵犯是这样彰明昭著，以至墨西哥政府慑于人民的猛烈反对，不敢贸然接受。
    法新社的消息还透露，墨西哥已经是曾经“拒绝接受美国国会在援外立法中所规定的条件”的第七个国家。同样由于国内人民的反对，伊朗政府曾表示不准备签订接受美国军事“援助”的协定。在缅甸和印尼，美国按照“共同安全法”进行的谈判也曾遭遇波折。
    美国以“援助”为名奴役他国人民的政策在墨西哥和其他国家所受到的挫折，使美国统治集团大为惊慌。法新社的消息说，“昨日（二月二十二日）宣布的墨西哥终止与美国关于给予军事援助的谈判的决定，已使华盛顿人士大为惊奇，并感到相当的焦虑。……美国外交界人士已开始害怕这些国家所采取的态度，可能会变成美国其他伙伴们的不幸的榜样。”
