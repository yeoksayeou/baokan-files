    The laboring people of the Soviet Union are greeting International Women's Day on March 8th this year, amidst the continued great development of the socialist economy and culture of our motherland.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people, implementing Stalin's plan for building communism, have victoriously completed the first post-war Five-Year Plan and have achieved new and brilliant victories in all aspects of the economy and culture in 1951. Industry is developing by leaps and bounds, socialist agriculture has achieved further successes, the latest machinery is being widely used in all sectors of the national economy, and labor productivity is constantly increasing. The Soviet working people are building great hydroelectric power stations, canals, and irrigation systems with great enthusiasm and creativity, and the completion of these projects will further help lay the material and technical foundations of communism.
    The achievements made in developing the national economy have guaranteed the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people. In our country, national income is constantly increasing, and consumer goods prices are falling. The real wages of workers and the income of farmers are increasing, and housing construction is being carried out on a large scale. In capitalist countries, unemployment is a disaster for the working people, while in socialist countries, unemployment does not exist.
    The power of the Soviet socialist state, which has consistently striven for lasting and solid world peace and to strengthen international friendship, is growing. The achievements of the Soviet state and its peaceful foreign policy have further enhanced the prestige and international influence of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The people of all countries around the world are increasingly convinced that the Soviet socialist system is superior to the capitalist system.
    Soviet women have made great contributions to the cause of strengthening the power of the socialist state. Having broken free from the shackles of capitalist political and economic oppression, Soviet women have given full play to their creative abilities and have become an active force in the construction of socialist society. Inspired by the great ideals of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, Soviet women are actively participating in the nationwide socialist competition to further develop our country's economy; they are striving for new achievements in socialist culture and contributing all their strength and knowledge to the cause of building communism.
    In all sectors of our country's national economy, there are many women trained by the Communist Party and the Soviet state participating in work. In our country, the number of women specialized talents with higher education has reached more than 830,000, which is more than three times that of the pre-war year of 1940. There are more than one million women studying in higher education institutions and secondary specialized education institutions.
    In industry, transportation, and construction, thousands upon thousands of female workers, female engineers, female technicians, and female foremen have become models of socialist labor attitude in the struggle to increase labor productivity; they are constantly improving their technical knowledge and production skills, mastering the latest engineering, and reaching very high production standards.
    Collective farmers and state farm peasants are working hard to increase yields, increase the number of publicly owned livestock and their production productivity, and actively participate in the realization of Stalin's plan to transform nature; they are mastering agricultural science knowledge and learning to drive agricultural machines. More than 40 percent of the country's agronomists are women, and hundreds of thousands of women have become tractor drivers and combine harvester drivers; hundreds of thousands of women workers have emerged in socialist agriculture and animal husbandry.
    Soviet women are actively participating in the work of developing Soviet science and culture. In the Soviet Union's scientific, educational, and cultural institutions, there are more than 2.5 million women workers, and hundreds of thousands of women are working in Soviet universities, colleges, and scientific research institutions, and their research results and discoveries have enriched Soviet science. Many Soviet women have demonstrated their creative talents in literature and art, creating many works with high ideological content, inspiring our people to create amazing heroic achievements for their motherland.
    Soviet women have achieved fruitful results in public education and health care. In the Soviet Union, the people generally receive seven years of education; ten-year primary education schools, specialized secondary schools, and higher education institutions are universally established throughout the Soviet Union, and state-run vocational and technical schools are also established. In these schools, there are more than one million female teachers who educate the younger generation with communist consciousness and Soviet patriotism. More than one million women serve in public health. The number of female doctors in our country has more than doubled compared with 1940, and now totals 200,700.
    The socialist motherland highly respects the selfless labor of Soviet female patriots. At present, 70 women have been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union; 2,170 women have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. More than 730,000 women have been awarded various orders and medals of the Soviet Union. They are workers, collective farmers, engineers, agronomists, and workers in culture, education, and health care. In addition, 579 women have received Stalin Prizes for their outstanding achievements in scientific inventions, literature, and art.
    The Communist Party and the Soviet government have consistently shown concern for mothers and children. In our country, motherhood is respected by everyone. More than 35,000 women have been awarded the title of "Mother Hero," and more than 3.5 million women have been awarded the "Glory of Motherhood" medal and the "Medal of Maternal Merit." The state has allocated 6 billion rubles in subsidies to mothers with many children and single mothers, and provides subsidies for newborn babies. Young Pioneer camps and children's sanatoriums receive hundreds of millions of rubles in funding from the state each year. Due to the increase in people's welfare and the state's constant concern for improving public health and maternal and child health care, the mortality rate of Soviet children has been greatly reduced. In recent years, the Soviet population has increased by more than 3 million people each year. In our country, a strong younger generation of communist builders is growing up, and all paths to a happy and creative life are unfolding before them.
    In the Soviet Union, women widely participate in the management of the state and the development of Soviet work. In the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, there are 280 female representatives; in the Supreme Soviets of the various union republics and autonomous republics, there are a total of 2,209 female representatives, and there are more than 500,000 female representatives in local Soviets. More than 40 percent of the people's judges and people's assessors are women.
    The great example of the Soviet Union inspires the women of the people's democratic countries to strive to build a new life. The women of China are actively participating in the work of restoring and developing their country's industry and agriculture, and actively participating in the implementation of democratic reforms. The women of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the Mongolian People's Republic are working with all the working people of their countries to build socialism victoriously. The women of the German Democratic Republic are working hard to establish a unified, independent, and democratic Germany.
    In capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, women are commemorating "March 8th" in the context of capitalists' further attacks on the living standards and democratic rights of the working people. The US and British imperialists are using preparations for a new war to intensify the plunder of the people and seek excess profits. In capitalist countries, military budgets are huge, the taxes borne by the people are increased, the prices of manufactured goods and food products are soaring, civilian production is being cut, and hundreds of thousands of working people have been forced into the ranks of the unemployed. The situation of working women and children is particularly dire, and millions of women and children are dying from unbearable labor, hunger, and disease.
    In the face of the threat of another world war, the camp of peace and democracy is uniting more and more closely; the international front of peace fighters, headed by the Soviet Union, is gradually expanding and strengthening. Approximately 600 million people have signed the declaration calling for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers.
    Working women around the world are celebrating International Women's Day with the slogan of strengthening the struggle for peace and strengthening the struggle against the threat of a new war prepared by the US and British imperialists. Millions of women are joining the ranks of peace and democracy fighters. Currently, 135 million women in 62 countries have joined the Women's International Democratic Federation, which is waging a firm and unwavering struggle for peace, for the economic and political rights of working women, and for the lives and future of children. The women of colonies and dependent countries are increasingly actively participating in this struggle.
    In various capitalist countries, millions of women are fighting for wage increases, for the establishment of labor protection systems and social insurance systems by the state, and for the state to increase spending on public education and child care.
    The working women of all countries demand the prohibition of atomic weapons, the reduction of armaments, and the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers; they oppose the bloody aggression of US imperialism against Korea. The women of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are at the forefront of the international democratic women's movement.
    Soviet women have a responsibility to further expand and strengthen international ties with women of all countries, and to actively fight with them for international peace, for friendship among all nations, and against the imperialists who are instigating a new world war.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) has instructed party organizations at all levels to set the central task of celebrating "March 8th" International Women's Day as: mobilizing the strength of Soviet women to engage in the struggle for a great new upsurge in the Soviet economy and culture, and guiding women to participate in the nationwide socialist production competition in order to strive for the early completion of the 1952 plan in all sectors of the national economy.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) calls on female workers, female engineers, and female technicians to more persistently redouble their efforts to increase labor productivity, to more actively strive to improve product quality, to strive to reduce production costs, to strive to save raw materials and electricity, and to more boldly learn to operate new machines and master the latest labor methods.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) calls on collective farm women, female workers at machine tractor stations and state farms, and female agricultural experts to tirelessly strive to increase the yields of all agricultural products, to do everything possible to increase the number of publicly owned livestock and improve their production productivity, to apply the achievements of agricultural science and advanced practical experience to the cultivation of collective farms and state farms, and to do everything possible to further strengthen and develop the publicly owned collective farm economy.
    Women engaged in scientific and cultural work should unswervingly promote the development of Soviet science and engineering, and contribute their creativity and talents to further develop socialist culture, literature and art, public education, and public health.
    In order to build a communist society in our country, party organizations at all levels must continue to guide women to participate in social production labor in industry, transportation, and agriculture, and must increase women's initiative in all aspects of public life, political life, state economic life, and cultural life. Party organizations at all levels should strengthen the political education of women, and should regularly care about improving their cultural and technical level, and care about improving their political and production enthusiasm. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) has instructed the party, Soviet, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels to more fully seize opportunities to promote female cadres, and to more boldly promote advanced women to participate in leadership work at all levels of party, Soviet, economic organs, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations, as well as in all sectors of the national economy and culture.
    Party, trade union, Communist Youth League, Soviet, and administrative organs have the responsibility to strengthen their daily care for improving the working conditions and living conditions of working women; they have the responsibility to provide constant assistance to mothers raising children, to further universally increase the number of various nurseries, clinics, public canteens, clothing repair shops, garment stores, laundries, and other service organizations that can reduce women's household labor, and to improve these aspects of work.
    On the occasion of "March 8th" International Women's Day, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) extends its congratulations to all the working women of the Soviet Union, and firmly believes that Soviet women will show more initiative and activity in all aspects of communist construction, and firmly believes that they will continue to work selflessly to increase the power of our great socialist Soviet motherland.

    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会
    关于三月八日国际妇女节的决定
    今年，苏联劳动人民在我们祖国的社会主义经济和文化继续大大发展的情况下迎接三月八日国际妇女节。
    在共产党的领导下，执行着建设共产主义的斯大林计划的苏联人民，已经胜利地完成了战后第一个五年计划，并且在一九五一年经济和文化各方面都获得了新的辉煌的胜利。工业正在大步地发展，社会主义农业已获得进一步的成就，国民经济的各部门都正在广泛地使用着最新式的机器，劳动生产率正在不断提高。苏联劳动人民正在以极大的热情和创造力建设伟大的水力发电站、运河和灌溉系统，这些工程的完成，就会将进一步帮助奠定共产主义的物质的和技术的基础。
    发展国民经济的工作中所获得的成就，保证了苏联人民的物质和文化生活水准的不断提高。在我国，国民收入不断地增加，消费品价格下降。职工们的实际工资和农民的收入都在增加，建筑住宅的工作也正在大规模地进行。在资本主义国家里，失业是劳动人民的灾难，而在社会主义国家里，失业是不存在的。
    一贯为争取持久而巩固的世界和平、为加强国际友好而奋斗的苏维埃社会主义国家的威力，正在增长。苏维埃国家的成就和它的和平外交政策，进一步地提高了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的威望和国际影响。全世界各国的人民越来越确信：苏维埃社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越。
    苏联妇女在加强社会主义国家的威力的事业中，有着伟大的贡献。苏联妇女摆脱了资本主义的政治和经济压迫的锁链，发挥了她们的创造能力，成了社会主义社会的一支积极的建设力量。苏联妇女在列宁和斯大林的党的伟大理想的鼓舞下，正在积极地参加全国的社会主义竞赛，以求进一步发展我国的经济；她们正在为社会主义文化的新成就而努力，并把她们所有的力量和知识贡献给建设共产主义的事业。
    在我国国民经济的一切部门中，都有由共产党和苏维埃国家培养出来的许多妇女参加工作。在我国，受过高等教育的妇女专门人材的人数，已达八十三万余人，相当于战前一九四○年的三倍以上。在高等教育机关和中等专门教育机关学习的妇女，有一百多万人。
    在工业、运输业和营造业方面，千千万万女工、女工程师、女技师和女领班成了提高劳动生产率的斗争中具有社会主义劳动态度的模范；她们不断地提高技术知识和生产技术，掌握最新的工程学，达到了很高的生产标准。
    集体农民和国家农场的农民都在努力提高收获量，增加公有牲畜的头数及其产量生产率，积极地参与实现斯大林改造自然计划；她们正在掌握农业科学知识，并正在学习驾驶农业机器。全国的农业学家当中有百分之四十以上是妇女，成千上万的妇女当了拖拉机手和联合收割机驾驶员；社会主义农业和牲畜饲养业中涌现了数十万妇女工作者。
    苏联妇女积极地参加发展苏联科学和文化的工作。在苏联的科学、教育和文化机关里，有二百五十多万妇女工作者，在苏联的大学、学院和科学研究机关里有几十万妇女在工作，她们的研究成果和发现丰富了苏维埃科学。许多苏联妇女表现了她们在文学艺术方面的创作才能，创作了许多具有高度思想内容的作品，鼓舞我国人民为自己的祖国创造惊人的英雄业迹。
    苏联妇女在公共教育和卫生事业方面有着丰硕的工作成果。在苏联，人民普遍得受七年教育；苏联全国各地普遍设有十年制初等教育学校、专业中等学校和高等学校，并设有国立的职业技术学校。在这些学校中有一百多万女教师，她们以共产主义觉悟和苏维埃爱国主义来教育年青的一代。一百多万妇女在公共卫生事业中服务。我国女医生的数目比一九四○年增加了一倍多，现在总数有二十万零七千人。
    社会主义祖国非常尊重苏联女爱国者的忘我劳动。现在，有七十名妇女得过苏联英雄的称号；有两千一百七十名妇女得过社会主义劳动英雄的称号。有七十三万多妇女得过苏联各种勋章和奖章。她们是工人、集体农民、工程师、农业学家、文化、教育和卫生事业工作者。此外，还有五百七十九名妇女因为在科学发明、文学和艺术方面有特出的成绩而获得过斯大林奖金。
    共产党和苏维埃政府始终如一地表现了对母亲和儿童的关怀。在我们的国家，母性受到人人的敬重。三万五千多名妇女得过“母亲英雄”的称号，三百五十多万妇女得过“母亲之光”勋章和“母德奖章”。国家已经拨款六十亿卢布津贴子女众多的母亲和单身母亲，并对新降生的婴儿给予补贴。少年先锋营和儿童休养所每年获得国家数亿卢布的拨款。由于人民福利的增进、由于国家对改善公共卫生和妇婴保健事业的经常关怀，苏联儿童的死亡率大大地降低了。在最近数年来，苏联人口每年增加三百多万。在我国，体魄坚强的青年一代的共产主义建设者正在成长，他们面前展开着走向幸福和创造性的生活的一切道路。
    在苏联，妇女广泛地参加管理国家并发展苏维埃的工作。在苏联最高苏维埃中，有二百八十名女代表；在各加盟共和国和自治共和国的最高苏维埃中，共有两千二百零九名女代表，地方苏维埃中的女代表共有五十万人以上。人民法官和人民陪审员中，百分之四十以上是妇女。
    苏联的伟大榜样，鼓舞着人民民主国家的妇女努力建设新的生活。中国的妇女正在积极地参加恢复和发展她们国家的工业和农业的工作，并积极地参加实行民主改革。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和蒙古人民共和国的妇女，正在和她们国家的全体劳动人民一道胜利地建设社会主义。德意志民主共和国的妇女正在努力争取建立一个统一、独立和民主的德国。
    在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国中，妇女们是在资本家进一步进攻劳动人民的生活水准和民主权利的情况下纪念“三八”节的。美英帝国主义者正在利用准备新战争来变本加厉地掠夺人民并谋取超额利润。在资本主义国家，军费预算庞大、人民所担负的赋税加重、制成品和粮食产品的价格高涨、民用生产被削减、数十万的劳动人民被迫参加了失业者的行列。劳动妇女和儿童的情况，尤其恶劣，千百万的妇女和儿童因为难以忍受的劳动、饥饿和疾病而死亡。
    面对着另一次世界大战的威胁，和平民主阵营正在日益紧密地团结起来；以苏联为首的国际和平战士阵线正在逐渐地扩大并加强。约有六亿的人民签名拥护要求五大国缔结和平公约的宣言。
    全世界的劳动妇女都以加强争取和平的斗争、加强为反对美英帝国主义者所准备的新战争的威胁而进行的斗争的口号，来庆祝国际妇女节。千百万的妇女正在参加和平民主战士的队伍。现在有六十二个国家的一亿三千五百万妇女参加了国际民主妇女联合会，它正在进行着坚决不渝的斗争，以争取和平、争取劳动妇女的经济和政治权利、争取儿童的生活和前途。殖民地和附属国的妇女们，正在日益积极地参加这个斗争。
    在各资本主义国家，千百万的妇女在为争取提高工资、为使国家设立劳动保护制度和社会保险制度、为使国家增加公共教育和儿童保健方面的开支而奋斗。
    各国的劳动妇女都要求禁止原子武器，要求裁减军备，要求五大国缔结和平公约；她们反对美帝国主义对朝鲜的血腥侵略。苏联和人民民主国家的妇女走在国际民主妇女运动的最前列。
    苏联妇女有责任更加扩大和加强与一切国家的妇女的国际联系，和她们在一起积极奋斗，争取国际和平，争取各民族间的友谊，反对煽动新世界战争的帝国主义者。
    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会已指示各级党组织，把庆祝“三八”国际妇女节的中心工作定为：动员苏联妇女的力量从事争取苏联经济和文化的伟大新高涨的斗争，引导妇女参加全国性的社会主义生产竞赛，以争取国民经济的一切部门提前完成一九五二年的计划。
    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会号召女工、女工程师和女技师更坚持地加倍努力，提高劳动生产率，更积极主动地争取提高产品质量，争取降低生产成本，争取节约原料和电力，更大胆地学习操纵新的机器，掌握最新的劳动方法。
    苏联共产党（布）中央委员会号召集体农妇、机器拖拉机站和国家农场的女工、女农业专家不倦地努力，争取提高一切农产品的收获量，尽一切努力增加公有牲畜的头数并提高其产品生产率，把农业科学和先进实际经验的成就应用到集体农场和国家农场的耕作中去，尽一切可能更进一步加强和发展公有的集体农场经济。
    从事科学和文化工作的妇女应该坚持不渝地推动苏联科学和工程学的发展，贡献出她们的创造力和才能来更进一步发展社会主义的文化、文学艺术、公共教育和公共卫生。
    为了在我国建设共产主义社会，各级党组织必须继续引导妇女参加工业、运输和农业方面的社会生产劳动，必须提高妇女在公共生活、政治生活、国家经济和文化生活等一切方面的积极性。各级党组织应该加强对妇女的政治教育工作，应该经常地关心提高她们的文化和技术水平，关心提高她们的政治积极性和生产积极性。苏联共产党（布）中央委员会已指示党、苏维埃、工会和共产主义青年团的各级组织更充分地抓紧机会提拔女干部，在党、苏维埃、经济机关、工会和共青团各级组织以及在国民经济和文化的一切部门中，更加放手地提拔先进的妇女参加领导工作。
    党、工会、共青团、苏维埃和行政机关有责任加强它们对改善劳动妇女的劳动条件和生活条件的日常关怀；它们有责任对于母亲抚养孩子给予经常的协助，更进一步普遍增设各种托儿所、医疗所、公共食堂、衣物缝补店、成衣店、洗衣店及其他可以减轻妇女的家庭劳作的服务机构，并改进这些方面的工作。
    值此“三八”国际妇女节，苏联共产党（布）中央委员会谨向苏联全体劳动妇女致贺，并深信苏联妇女将在共产主义建设的一切方面表现得更为主动积极，深信她们将继续忘我地努力，以增加我们伟大的社会主义苏维埃祖国的威力。
