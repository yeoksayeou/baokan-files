Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th: The Shenyang Municipal People's Government announced on the 10th the conclusion of cases for 11,502 industrial and commercial households; at the same time, it arrested 20 major thieves who were extremely guilty and refused to confess.

The process by which the People's Government handled these closed-case industrial and commercial households was as follows: first, the industrial and commercial households filled out the "'Five-Anti' Conclusion Report Form," which was discussed and approved by the same trade group, then jointly reviewed by the trade union of each industry, and finally meticulously verified, reviewed, and approved by the economy inspection committee of each district. Under the leadership of the district economy inspection committee, the workers in each industry collected sufficient materials on these illegal industrial and commercial operators in advance. When passing the industrial and commercial operators' report forms, they also launched a face-to-face struggle with the illegal industrial and commercial operators. They carefully and meticulously reviewed the materials confessed by the industrial and commercial operators, exposed and reported the illegal activities that the capitalists attempted to conceal; and educated the illegal industrial and commercial operators that they must abide by the law, obey the leadership of the People's Government, and are not allowed to engage in illegal activities again. Under the active exposure, reporting, and education of the workers, many illegal capitalists realized that only confession could lead to a way out. For example, Li Guozhen, the manager of Xingsheng Iron Furnace, an illegal capitalist in the Nan District, stole work and materials worth more than 260 million yuan when processing automobile springs for the state. However, he was unwilling to confess clearly when he confessed, only talking about stealing work and materials worth more than 100 million yuan. The workers immediately put forward strong rebuttals and questions based on the materials they had mastered, finally forcing him to confess all the illegal facts.

Among the more than 11,000 industrial and commercial households whose cases have been concluded this time, some are law-abiding households, some are basically law-abiding households, and some are half-law-abiding and half-illegal households. The People's Government will issue them notices of law-abiding, basically law-abiding, and half-law-abiding and half-illegal households respectively. For some serious illegal households who have performed meritorious service after confessing, the People's Government will also reduce or exempt the fines they should pay as appropriate. For example, Liu Jinfang, the manager of Heji Iron Shop, had engaged in speculation and profiteering and evaded huge amounts of taxes, and the circumstances of his violations were serious. However, after being educated by the working group of the economy inspection committee, he confessed his illegal activities relatively thoroughly, reported other illegal industrial and commercial households, and guaranteed that he would not repeat the same mistakes in the future, so the People's Government announced that he would be given lenient treatment. Wang Junjie, the manager of Junxing Iron Factory, who had performed meritorious service to a greater extent, was given lenient treatment without refund or fine.

At the same time as leniently handling a group of industrial and commercial households, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government arrested 20 illegal industrial and commercial operators who were extremely guilty and still refused to confess after repeated education, based on their criminal facts and the demands of the masses. These included Ma Chunlin, deputy director of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and manager of Dongmin Iron Factory, Zhang Shida, chairman of the Civil Engineering and Building Industry Guild, Bo Qianqiao, chairman of the Edible Oil Industry Guild, Wang Xingya, chairman of the Printing and Dyeing Industry Guild, and Xu Jingtai, chairman of the Gold and Silver Industry Guild. Ma Chunlin had consistently evaded state taxes, stolen state property, corrupted cadres, stolen state economic intelligence, and manipulated production. In the "Five-Anti" movement, he not only refused to confess, but also organized the so-called "three lines of defense," sending "detectives" to infiltrate the workers to inquire about information, attempting to undermine the movement. In view of this serious situation, the People's Government should have arrested and punished him according to law long ago, but in order to give him a chance to reform himself, the People's Government sent a working group to Dongmin Iron Factory to inspect and urge him to confess seriously. During the inspection, the relevant parties and government leaders repeatedly enlightened and educated him, but he still cunningly denied and stubbornly resisted the movement. Zhang Shida, Bo Qianqiao, Wang Xingya, Xu Jingtai and others, as leaders of the industry guilds, had committed serious crimes in the past, and all resisted confession and undermined the movement in the same way as Ma Chunlin. Therefore, the Municipal People's Government has arrested them all in accordance with the law. For some illegal capitalists whose attitude is not honest enough and whose confession is not thorough enough, the Municipal People's Government has ordered them to continue to reflect, confess within a time limit, and then deal with them.

    沈阳宽大处理大批工商户
    同时逮捕拒不坦白的大盗窃犯
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】沈阳市人民政府在十日宣布了对一万一千五百零二户工商业者的结案处理；同时逮捕了二十名罪大恶极、拒不坦白的大盗窃犯。
    人民政府对这批已结案的工商户的处理过程是：先由工商业户填写“‘五反’结论报告表”，经同业小组讨论通过后，再由各行业职工联合审查，最后由各区的节约检查委员会缜密对证、审查和批准。各行业职工在区节约检查委员会领导下，事前搜集了这些违法工商业者的充分材料，在通过工商业者的报告表时，又和违法工商业者展开了面对面的斗争。他们认真仔细地逐项审查工商业者坦白的材料，揭发和检举资本家企图隐瞒的非法行为；并教育违法工商业者今后必须安分守己，服从人民政府的领导，不准再有违法活动。在职工们的积极揭发、检举和教育下，许多违法资本家认识到只有坦白才有出路。如南市区违法资本家兴盛铁炉经理李国祯，在给国家加工汽车弓子等时曾偷工减料二亿六千多万元。但他在坦白时不肯交代清楚，只谈偷工减料一亿多元。职工们马上根据掌握的材料，提出有力的反驳和责问，终于迫使他谈出了全部违法事实。
    在这次已结案的一万一千多户工商业者中，有的是守法户，有的是基本守法户；有的是半守法半违法户。人民政府将分别发给他们守法、基本守法和半守法半违法户的通知书。对于一些坦白后有立功赎罪表现的严重违法户，人民政府也酌量减免他们应罚的款项。如合记铁店经理刘锦芳曾投机倒把，偷漏巨额税款，违法情节严重。但经节约检查委员会工作组教育后，比较彻底地坦白了不法行为，还检举了其他不法工商业户，并保证自己今后不再重犯，人民政府即宣布予以宽大处理。有较大立功赎罪表现的俊兴铁工厂经理王俊杰，并受到了不退、不罚的宽大处理。
    与宽大处理一批工商业户的同时，沈阳市人民政府对二十户罪大恶极、经再三教育仍然拒不坦白的违法工商业者，根据他们的罪恶事实和群众的要求予以逮捕。其中包括沈阳市工商联合会副主任委员、东民铁工厂经理马春霖，土木建筑业同业公会理事长张士达，食用油业同业公会理事长伯千乔，印染业同业公会理事长王兴亚，金银业同业公会理事长徐景泰等。马春霖一贯偷漏国税、盗窃国家资财、腐蚀干部、盗窃国家经济情报，操纵生产。在“五反”运动中，他不但拒不坦白，反而组织所谓“三道防线”，派“侦探”打入职工内部探听消息，企图破坏运动。根据这种严重情况，人民政府本早应依法逮捕惩办，但为给他改造自新的机会，人民政府曾派工作组去东民铁工厂检查，促其认真坦白。在检查期间，有关方面和政府首长又对他一再启发教育，但他仍狡猾抵赖，对运动顽强抗拒。张士达、伯千乔、王兴亚、徐景泰等身为同业公会的领导人，过去罪恶严重，在运动中也都与马春霖同样抗拒坦白，破坏运动。因此，市人民政府已依法将他们一并逮捕。对一部分态度还不够老实，坦白还不够彻底的不法资本家，市人民政府已令他们继续反省，限期坦白，再作处理。
