    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 29th: At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 29th, during the discussion of the wording of the armistice agreement draft, the other side once again created side issues and unreasonably demanded that the word "South Korea" be used in the Korean and Chinese versions of the agreement draft in places where it should say "Korea"; and insisted on using the name "International United Army" in the Korean version of the agreement draft to replace the correct translation of "United Nations Forces." Our side pointed out that the name Korea has a long history, and the Korean language cannot allow the arbitrary changing of its clear meaning in the armistice agreement. For the integrity of the armistice agreement, the Korean name for the "United Nations Forces" should have used the correct translation, but since the other side insisted on using the name "International United Army," our side suggested that the problems of these two terms be resolved at the same time. Our side agreed with the other side's opinion on the Korean translation of its own name, but the other side must respect our side's correct usage of the name "Korea." At the meeting on the 29th, the other side still made a fuss over a minor issue and insisted on using the word "South Korea." This attitude of creating side issues on the part of the other side only exposed once again the other side's attempt to deliberately delay the armistice negotiations.

    At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, the two sides continued to exchange views on the issue of the principles of prisoner repatriation. After the staff meeting adjourned, at the request of the other side, each side sent one staff member to confer on the issue of the location of our prisoner-of-war camps and aerial markings. In response to the questions raised by the other side, our staff pointed out that the specific locations of our prisoner-of-war camps had already been clearly marked on the map for the other side, and that all prisoner-of-war camps had been marked with obvious agreed-upon markings in accordance with the agreement between the two sides. If the other side can abide by the agreement and care about the safety of its own captured personnel, and not carry out indiscriminate bombing, there will be absolutely no problem with the safety of the captured personnel from the other side in our prisoner-of-war camps. After the other side had obtained the specific locations of our prisoner-of-war camps, and our prisoner-of-war camps had been marked with obvious markings, incidents of bombing and strafing our prisoner-of-war camps still occurred twice in succession, which shows that the other side does not care about the safety of its captured personnel. In order to carry out its indiscriminate bombing, the other side has again demanded that we transfer the location of several prisoner-of-war camps, which has been sternly rejected by our side.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上
    美方竟又节外生枝蓄意拖延谈判会议
    我方严词拒绝对方所提转移若干战俘营位置的无理要求
    【新华社开城二十九日电】二十九日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，在关于停战协定草案的文字的讨论中，对方又一次节外生枝，无理要求在朝文与中文的协定草案中应作“朝鲜”处，使用
    “韩国”的字样；并坚持在朝文协定草案中，使用“国际联合军”的名称，以代替“联合国军”的正确译名。我方指出：朝鲜的名称，有着悠久的历史，朝鲜语言不能容许在停战协定中任意改变其明确含义。为了停战协定的完整，“联合国军”的朝文名称，本应使用正确的译名，但由于对方坚持使用“国际联合军”的名称，我方建议将这两个名词的问题同时解决。我方同意对方对于对方本身名称的朝文译文的意见，但对方必须尊重我方对于“朝鲜”的名称的正确使用。对方在二十九日的会上，却仍然小题大做，坚持使用“韩国”的字样。对方这种节外生枝的态度，只是又一次暴露了对方蓄意拖延停战谈判的企图。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方继续就遣俘原则问题交换意见。参谋会议休会后，应对方要求，双方各派参谋一人会商关于我方各战俘营的位置及对空标志问题。在答复对方所提出问题时，我方参谋人员指出，我方战俘营的具体位置早已在地图上明确标示给对方，且各战俘营均已按照双方协议设有明显的约定标志。如果对方能遵守协议，并关心其本方被俘人员的安全，不进行狂轰滥炸，在我方战俘营的对方被俘人员的安全绝无问题。在对方已获得我方各战俘营的具体位置，且我方各战俘营已作了明显的标志后，竟仍连续两次发生轰炸及扫射我方战俘营的事件，足见对方并不关心其被俘人员之安全。对方为进行其狂轰滥炸，又要求我转移若干战俘营位置，已遭我严词拒绝。
