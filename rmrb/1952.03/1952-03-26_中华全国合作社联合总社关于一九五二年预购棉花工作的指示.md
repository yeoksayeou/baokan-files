The State Council of the Central People's Government pointed out in its "Decision on Agricultural Production in 1952": "Mutual aid teams and production cooperatives should formulate production increase plans and sign pre-purchase contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives to integrate the state's economic plans with the economic organizations of farmers." Cooperatives should carry out the 1952 pre-purchase work on the basis of last year's pre-purchase work.

In 1951, the pre-purchase work played a certain role in helping farmers overcome some difficulties in production, expanding the area of industrial raw material crops, ensuring the completion of the state's production increase plan, and promoting the development of cooperative organizations and businesses. Because cooperatives purchased cotton at prices stipulated by the state based on pre-purchase contracts, and supplied farmers with the production and living materials they needed at low prices based on orders, farmers benefited materially from production to cotton sales and the purchase of materials. This kind of organized and planned supply and marketing business has begun to sprout a new form of commodity circulation between cities and rural areas, industrial products and agricultural products, that is, planned and organized transactions, rather than the old free transactions, which is important for farmers to develop collective habits.

However, due to insufficient understanding of the political and economic role of the pre-purchase work, sufficient preparation and extensive and in-depth mobilization were not carried out, so cadres and farmers were not fully mobilized and organized into this work. Also, due to lack of experience, there was a lack of necessary accounting management and statistical systems, as well as clearing work during the purchase, which caused confusion in the recovery of pre-purchases. This must be thoroughly changed.

(II)

This year's national policy of increasing cotton production is to increase the yield per unit area on the basis of last year's cotton fields. In order to fulfill this national plan and the task of purchasing cotton on behalf of the state, cooperatives in cotton-producing areas are required to pre-purchase 40% of the total cotton production in 1952; after the autumn harvest, purchases will be carried out on the basis of pre-purchases. Pre-purchases should be carried out by grassroots cooperatives signing pre-purchase contracts with agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and member groups, and generally should not be signed with individual farmers. In areas where there is no basis for labor mutual aid, or where grassroots cooperatives have no foundation or are unsound, under the leadership of the Party and government, efforts should be made to obtain assistance from other mass organizations, combined with pre-purchase business, to vigorously develop and improve the organization and business work of mutual aid teams and cooperatives.

The pre-purchase method mainly adopts "credit pre-purchase", followed by "credit sales pre-purchase". Generally, credit pre-purchase is adopted for wealthy farmers, that is, farmers exchange their products or cash for fertilizers, grain, coal and other production and living materials from the cooperative, and at the same time, the cotton they produce must be pre-purchased by the cooperative. For disaster areas and general poor peasants who have real difficulties in production, the latter method is adopted, that is, a deposit is prepaid to pre-purchase the cotton they produce. This deposit should not exceed 10% of the total pre-purchase value in principle. In this way, the production difficulties of different farmers can be solved, and the state's loans can play a greater role. Last year, only the "credit sales pre-purchase" method was adopted, which prevented the loan from circulating, and therefore could not solve the difficulties of more farmers, which was wrong. The prepayment of deposits is uniformly distributed by the National Federation of Cooperatives, and the major district cooperatives adjust themselves according to specific economic conditions. The pre-purchase quantity and the name and quality of prepaid materials of each level of cooperative are contracted level by level from the National Federation of Cooperatives to the grassroots cooperatives.

According to national requirements and last year's experience, the focus of pre-purchase should be on cotton crops, and should not be evenly placed on general cash crops. The price of pre-purchased cotton is the actual price obtained by cotton farmers according to the ratio of cotton to grain stipulated by the state at the time of purchase; after the new cotton is on the market, the cooperative will purchase it according to the price list stipulated by the state.

In order to eliminate the concerns of cotton farmers about the need for physical goods after the autumn harvest and promote the planning of the cooperative's supply business, when signing pre-purchase contracts, several major materials should be appropriately stipulated according to the state's ability to supply and the operating capacity of cooperatives at all levels, and "order forms" should be signed with cotton farmers. The materials ordered should be limited to those urgently needed by cotton farmers and that can be guaranteed to be supplied in a timely manner. In order to encourage cotton farmers to store cotton after the autumn harvest, the ordered materials generally do not exceed 30% of the total pre-purchase value. The specific methods for order forms will be stipulated separately.

The pre-purchase time is mainly from mid-April to mid-June, and ends at the end of July, that is, it must be settled separately. The specific methods and accounting treatment will be stipulated separately.

(III)

The cotton business in 1952 is one of the central tasks of cooperatives in cotton-producing areas throughout the year. Cooperatives at all levels in cotton-producing areas should list the cotton pre-purchase business as the central task of the second quarter.

Experience has proved that organization and leadership, and publicity and mobilization are important keys to doing a good job in pre-purchase business. Cooperatives at all levels must, according to the instructions of the National Federation of Cooperatives, under the leadership of the Party and government, in coordination with agricultural and trade departments, deploy from top to bottom, carry out in-depth mobilization, explain the policies and methods, and carry out pre-purchase on the basis of the voluntary participation of cotton farmers, avoiding coercion and commandism, and a purely numerical task perspective. When signing contracts, the contracts should be drafted in writing after the unanimous agreement of the masses through the members' representative meeting, the agricultural production cooperative, and the mutual aid team meeting, and representatives elected by the farmers should sign and seal the contracts seriously and responsibly.

The cotton pre-purchase business is the current central task of cooperatives at all levels. The idea that pre-purchase work is only the task of the business department is harmful. Before deploying the work, the council of each level of cooperative must hold a meeting to explain the policies and methods, organize and plan, and the cadres, finance and accounting, supply, and sales departments must clearly divide the work and closely combine to complete the pre-purchase work.

Spring plowing is imminent, cooperatives at all levels must immediately mobilize, concentrate their efforts, and seize the time to deploy, and strive to complete the task of pre-purchasing cotton by cooperatives in 1952!

    中华全国合作社联合总社关于一九五二年预购棉花工作的指示
    （一）
    中央人民政府政务院关于一九五二年农业生产的决定中指出：“互助组和生产合作社要订立增产计划，并与供销合作社订立预购合同，使国家的经济计划与农民的经济组织结合起来。”合作社应在去年预购工作的基础上，开展一九五二年的预购工作。
    一九五一年的预购工作，在帮助农民克服生产中某些困难，扩大工业原料作物的面积，保证完成国家增产计划，及推进合作社组织和业务的发展上，均起了一定的作用。由于合作社在预购合同的基础上，根据国家规定的价格收购棉花，又根据定货单廉价地供给农民所需要的生产资料和生活资料，这样，就使农民从生产到推销棉花，及购买物资上，都得到了物质实惠。这种带有组织性、有计划性的供销业务，开始萌芽了城市与农村、工业品与农产品之间，新的商品流转形式，即有计划有组织地交易，而不是旧的自由交易，这对农民养成集体习惯有着重要的作用。
    但由于对预购工作在政治上、经济上的作用认识不足，就没有进行充分的准备工作，和广泛地，深入地动员工作，因此干部和农民没有能够被充分地发动和组织到这一工作中来。又由于缺乏经验，就缺乏一套必要的账务管理与统计制度，以及收购时的清理工作，就造成了收回预购时的混乱情况，这是必须彻底加以改变的。（二）
    今年国家增产棉花的方针，是在去年棉田基础上，提高单位面积产量。合作社为了完成国家这一计划和代国家收购棉花的任务，一九五二年要求棉产区合作社预购棉花总产量百分之四十；秋收后，即在预购基础上，进行收购。预购应由基层合作社与农业生产合作社、互助组及社员小组订立预购合同，一般不应与个体农民订立预购合同。在劳动互助尚无基础的地区，或基层合作社尚无基础或不健全的地区，应在党政领导下，争取其他群众组织帮助，结合预购业务，大力发展，并健全互助组和合作社的组织及业务工作。
    预购办法主要采用“信用预购”，其次采用“赊销预购”。一般对富裕农民采用信用预购，即农民以其产品或现款换购合作社的肥料、粮、煤及其他生产和生活资料，同时须将其生产的棉花，由合作社预购下来。对灾区和一般贫农，生产上确有困难者，采用后一种办法，即预付一部定金，把其生产的棉花预购下来，这种定金应以不超过全部预购总值百分之十为原则。这样，既可解决不同农民的生产困难，又可使国家贷款发挥更大的作用。去年只采用了“赊销定购”一种办法，致使贷款不能周转，因而不能解决更多农民的困难，是不对的。预付定金由全国总社统一分配，各大区社根据具体经济情况，自行调剂。各级社预购数量与预付物资品名、质量，由全国总社至基层合作社逐级签订合同。
    根据国家要求和去年经验，应把预购重点放在棉花作物上，不应平均地放在一般经济作物上。预购棉花的价格，以国家规定收购时之棉粮比价为棉农实得之价格；新花上市后，合作社根据国家规定之牌价，进行收购。
    为解除棉农秋后实物需要的顾虑，促进合作社供应业务的计划性，在订立预购合同时，应根据国家能够供应，及各级合作社经营能力，适当地规定几种主要物资，与棉农签订“订货单”。所订物资，应以棉农迫切需要而又能保证及时供应的为限。为鼓励棉农秋后储棉，订货物资一般不超过预购总值百分之三十。订货单之具体办法，另订之。
    预购时间，主要在四月中旬到六月中旬进行，到七月底告一段落，即须单独结算。其具体办法及账务处理另行规定。
    （三）
    一九五二年棉花业务为棉产区合作社全年中心工作之一。棉产区各级合作社，应把棉花预购业务，列为第二季度的中心任务。
    经验证明：组织领导，宣传动员是搞好预购业务的重要关键。各级社必须根据全国总社指示，在党政领导下，配合农业和贸易部门，自上而下布置，进行深入的动员，讲清政策和办法，在棉农自愿基础上进行预购，避免强迫命令，单纯数字任务观点。签订合同时，应通过社员代表会议、农业生产社、互助组会议，经群众一致同意后，拟订书面合同，由农民推选代表，严肃负责，签字盖章。
    棉花预购业务为各级合作社当前的中心工作。认为预购工作仅为业务部门的任务的想法是有害的。各级社理事会，于布置工作前，必须召开会议，讲清政策和办法，组织计划、组导、干部、财会、供应、推销各部门，明确分工而又密切结合地完成预购工作。
    春耕在即，各级社必须立即动员起来，集中力量，抓紧布置，为完成合作社一九五二年预购棉花任务而奋斗！
