Two Different Paths for Scientists
		Hu Weibai

	American warmongers have spread potato beetles to destroy crops in the German Democratic Republic, repeatedly used poison gas in Korea, and are now spreading poisons and poisonous insects in Korea and even in Northeast China and Qingdao.

	This illustrates what the "scientific achievements" of the United States, once worshiped or promoted by some, are; it shows that this kind of so-called "science," under the brutal monopoly and supervision of the bourgeoisie, can only go down the dead end of increasing exploitation profits and enslaving mankind, and is openly used to attack workers and peace-loving people all over the world. Physics is used to make atomic bombs; chemistry is used to produce poison gas; the science of life—biology—becomes the science of death; medicine is not for the benefit of the people, but becomes a method of mass extermination of mankind; "bacteriology" and "entomology" are no longer aimed at eliminating bacteria and insects harmful to mankind, but have become sciences specializing in cultivating and spreading bacteria and insects harmful to mankind.

	What is science ultimately for? People with neurasthenia are crying out about a "crisis of science."

	But there is another kind of science, a science led by proletarian ideology, serving the people, opposing the obsolete, daring to innovate, developing vigorously, full of constructiveness and great vision, becoming a tool to safeguard peace, and giving strength to human life—Soviet science is the most outstanding example.

	Those "American scientific masters" who were once worshiped or flaunted by a few self-proclaimed "supra-class" scientific workers, chanted "for academics, for humanity," but their bloody hands were making poison gas and cultivating killer bacteria; they hung up the signboard of "scientific research" but were actually destroying science and culture. These fake scientific workers are actually lackeys who sell themselves to the moneybags, slaves who have lost their reason, accomplices of warmongers, and public enemies of peace-loving people.

	"You can't blame the scientists for this!" Some people have defended themselves and others in this way. As if being led by the nose by capitalists is excusable, and there is no other way out!

	But there is another kind of scientific worker, who dares to resist the enslavement of the exploiting class, who closely connects with the broad masses of working people, and wholeheartedly serves the people; they are not isolated thinkers, but fighters for world peace. Their work is entirely for the interests of the proletariat, and they are full of vitality in striving for the great cause of socialism. These are glorious scientific workers.

	It is obvious that in a class society, science cannot transcend the control of the ruling class. In imperialist America, all the work of scientists is causing stagnation and crisis in the development of science because it is dependent on capitalists; to eliminate this crisis, there is no other way than to eliminate imperialist rule.

	Natural scientists, as members of society, cannot transcend the social, political, and economic life, and they cannot but have a class stand. If they do not face the people, they will turn their backs on the people; if they do not harbor extreme hatred to resist the imperialists, they will lack the love for the broad masses of the people of the motherland. The paths and boundaries between them are very clear.

    科学家的两种不同道路
    胡为柏
    美国的战争贩子在德意志民主共和国撒布过杀害农作物的马铃薯甲虫，在朝鲜多次施放毒气，现在又在朝鲜以至我国的东北和青岛撒放毒物和毒虫了。
    这就说明了那曾经被一些人崇拜或宣扬过的美国的“科学成就”是什么；说明了这一种所谓“科学”，在资产阶级残暴的垄断和监督之下，只能向增加剥削利润和奴役人类的死路上走，公开地被利用来向劳动者和全世界和平人民进攻。物理学被用来制造原子弹；化学被用来生产毒气；生命的科学—生物学变为死亡的科学；医学不是为了造福人民，而变成大量消灭人类的方法；“细菌学”、“昆虫学”不再是以消灭对人类有害的细菌昆虫为目标，已变为专门培养及传布对人类有害的细菌和昆虫的科学。
    科学究竟为的是什么？神经衰弱的人喊起“科学的危机”来了。
    但有另外一种科学，是无产阶级思想领导下，为人民服务的科学，它反对陈腐，勇于革新，正在蓬勃发展，充满着建设性和伟大的远景，成为保障和平的工具，给予人类生命以力量——苏维埃科学就是最出色的榜样。
    就是那些曾经被少数自以为“超阶级”的科学工作者所崇拜或炫耀过的“美国科学大师”，口里高唱“为学术、为人类”，而他的血淋淋的双手却在制造毒气，培养杀人的细菌；他挂着“研究科学”的招牌而实际是在破坏科学和文化。这些冒牌的科学工作者，实际上是卖身投靠钱袋的仆从，是属于失掉理性的奴隶，是战争贩子的同谋犯，是和平人民的公敌。
    “这也怪不得科学家啊！”有人曾经这样地来替自己和别人辩护。好像被资本家牵着鼻子走是情有可原，没有其他出路！
    但是就有另外一种科学工作者，他们敢于反抗剥削阶级的奴役，他们紧密地和广大劳动人民相联系，忠心耿耿地为人民服务；他们不是与世隔绝的思想家，而是世界和平的斗士。他们的工作完全为了无产阶级的利益，活力充沛地为社会主义的伟大事业而努力。这是光荣的科学工作者。
    很明显的，科学在阶级社会里，就不能超脱统治阶级的掌握。在帝国主义的美国，科学家的一切工作就因为依附于资本家而造成科学发展的停滞和危机；要消灭这危机，除了消灭帝国主义统治以外，没有其他途径。
    自然科学工作者既是社会的一分子，他本身就不能超越社会政治经济的生活，他就不能不有阶级立场。他不面向人民，就要背向人民；他如果不怀着极度的仇恨去反抗帝国主义者，他就会缺乏对于祖国广大人民的热爱。其间的道路和界限是很明确的。
