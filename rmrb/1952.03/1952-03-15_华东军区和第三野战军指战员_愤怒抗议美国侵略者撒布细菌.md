Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 12th - Following the American imperialist military aircraft spreading germs in Korea, they have continually violated our Northeast airspace and spread large quantities of germs. This towering crime has aroused the boundless anger of all commanders and fighters of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement of March 8th.

Air Force soldier Lü Huaijin personally witnessed the crimes of the Japanese bandits spreading germs in Jinhua, Ningbo, and other places. He said: "We cannot tolerate American imperialism using Japanese war criminals to continue slaughtering the Chinese people. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and must severely punish the American murderers who use bacteriological weapons." The entire soldiers of the model training squad of the ninth company, first platoon of a certain army regiment, after reading the news of American imperialism carrying out large-scale germ warfare, unanimously pointed out in anger that the American imperialists' crimes of invading the motherland's airspace and slaughtering the Chinese and Korean people are intolerable. They expressed that they must further heighten their vigilance, intensify their studies, and practice strict economy to enhance the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea, and defending the motherland and world peace. Medical personnel in the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army have also requested the organization of epidemic prevention and inspection teams to go to the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare. All members of the epidemic prevention team of the Logistics Health Department of the East China Military Region and the students of the Nursing School of the East China Military Region Hospital jointly wrote to their superiors, requesting to go to the areas where American troops spread germs to smash the American imperialists' aggressive plot to massacre the Chinese and Korean people.
