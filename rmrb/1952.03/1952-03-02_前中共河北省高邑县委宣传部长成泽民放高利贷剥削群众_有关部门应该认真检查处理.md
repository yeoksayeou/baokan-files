    Former Propaganda Minister of the CCP Hebei Province Gaoyi County Committee, Cheng Zemin, Exploits the Masses by Lending Money at High Interest Rates.
    Relevant Departments Should Seriously Investigate and Handle This.
    Editor: We are reporting the criminal behavior of Cheng Zemin, the former Propaganda Minister of the CCP Hebei Province Gaoyi County Committee, who abused his power to illegally lend money at high interest rates.

    In 1950 and 1951, Cheng Zemin used the methods of the exploiting class, taking advantage of the time when the masses were short of food, to lend a total of 3,927 jin of surplus rice from the agency's mess to the masses in Beiguan (exchanging 100 jin of rice for 140 jin of wheat). In four months, he obtained a profit of 1,570 jin of wheat. More seriously, he lent rice that had gone bad from the agency's production to the masses, stipulating that 100 jin of rice would be exchanged for 120 jin of wheat, obtaining a profit of 1,689 jin of wheat in just three months. Because Cheng Zemin and the County Committee Secretary Wang Baozhen took the lead in lending money at high interest rates, other county-level agencies followed suit. For example, the Gaoyi County People's Government had 60 shi of wheat that were frequently lent out. After Cheng Zemin was transferred to work in the Propaganda Department of the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee, the CCP Gaoyi County Committee continued to lend out 25,400 jin of rice from construction funds to make a profit. Some cadres and correspondents even believed that lending was "legal." Cheng Zemin started lending money at high interest rates with a capital of 570 jin of rice in the spring of 1950, and by the autumn, the principal and interest had turned into 1,258 jin of millet. In 1951, Cheng Zemin's wife, Ji Dezhen, exchanged 400 jin of millet for 480 jin of wheat. The masses in Beiguan said: "The County Committee agency lends money for exploitation, which is even worse than the landlords."

    At the beginning of the anti-corruption movement, the Gaoyi County Committee agency branch submitted Cheng Zemin's materials to the Hebei Provincial Committee Propaganda Department's Thrift Inspection Committee to help Cheng Zemin correct his mistakes. However, Cheng Zemin adopted a resistant attitude. In a letter "inspecting" himself, he said: "Lending grain to the masses is helping the masses with production and is not wrong. We cannot 'fail to distinguish right from wrong' and oppose what is 'correct' just because we are opposing bourgeois ideology." Cheng Zemin was clearly taking the opportunity to exploit the masses, but he described it as helping the masses with production. What a shameful nonsense!

    We are not satisfied with Cheng Zemin's self-criticism. We believe he should honestly make a deep self-criticism again.
        All Comrades of the CCP Hebei Province Gaoyi County Committee

    Editor's Note: The mistakes of Cheng Zemin and other relevant personnel are extremely serious. The Hebei Provincial Committee and the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee should seriously deal with them.

### 前中共河北省高邑县委宣传部长成泽民放高利贷剥削群众  有关部门应该认真检查处理

    前中共河北省高邑县委宣传部长成泽民放高利贷剥削群众
    有关部门应该认真检查处理
    编辑同志：我们检举前中共河北省高邑县委员会宣传部长成泽民利用职权，非法放高利贷的犯罪行为。
    在一九五零年和一九五一年的两年中，成泽民用剥削阶级的手段，乘着群众青黄不接时节，先后把机关伙食余米三千九百二十七斤，贷给北关的群众
    （每百斤米换一百四十斤麦子）。他在四个月中，获得暴利一千五百七十斤麦子。更严重的是，他把机关生产里有了臭味的米借给群众，规定每百斤米换一百二十斤麦子，不过三个月获得暴利一千六百八十九斤麦子。由于成泽民和县委书记王保珍带头放高利贷，县级其他机关也照样作起来了。如高邑县人民政府有六十石麦子经常在外出借。成泽民调到中共河北省委宣传部工作后，中共高邑县委员会还继续把修建费两万五千四百斤米借出取利。有的干部和通信员竟认为出贷是“合法”的。成泽民用五百七十斤米的本钱从一九五零年春天开始放高利贷，到秋后连本带利变成了一千二百五十八斤小米。一九五一年，成泽民的妻子纪德真又以四百斤小米换成四百八十斤麦子。北关的群众说：“县委机关出贷剥削，比地主还厉害。”
    反贪污运动开始时，高邑县委机关支部就把成泽民的材料送交河北省委宣传部节约检查委员会，以帮助成泽民纠正错误。但是成泽民却采取了抵抗的态度。他在“检查”自己的来信中说：“贷粮食给群众是帮助群众生产，没有错误，我们不能因为反资产阶级思想便‘是非不分’，把‘正确的’也反掉。”成泽民明明是乘机剥削群众，自己却说成是帮助群众生产，这是何等可耻的胡说！
    我们对成泽民的检讨是不满意的。我们认为他应该老老实实地重新作深刻检讨。
        中共河北省高邑县委员会全体同志
    编者按：成泽民及其他有关人员的错误，是极其严重的。河北省委和石家庄地委应认真加以处理。
