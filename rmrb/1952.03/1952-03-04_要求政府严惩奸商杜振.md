    Demand the Government Severely Punish the Unscrupulous Merchant Du Zhen
    Editor: Du Zhen, an unscrupulous merchant from the Hangzhou City Qiangli Automobile Repair Iron Factory, sought exorbitant profits and undermined the Liberation War. In February 1950, the Mechanical Department of a certain corps of the Zhejiang Military Region commissioned Du Zhen to customize 2,000 pieces of certain equipment. Knowing that these were supplies for the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands, Du Zhen took the opportunity to defraud, demanding 200,000 yuan per piece, but subcontracted the work to a small iron factory in Shanghai at a price of 100,000 yuan each, embezzling 200 million yuan in the process. The quality of this batch of equipment was very poor, with 60 percent being defective. In the same month, he contracted with the Zhejiang Military Region for more than 2,000 military shovels, at 92,000 yuan per shovel. He used the same trick, subcontracting the order to a certain factory at a price of 70,800 yuan per shovel, instantly pocketing more than 50 million yuan. Many of these shovels were substandard and broke easily upon use. He also subcontracted and cut corners in contracting for the military region's picks, broadswords, and other items. After the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement began, Du Zhen and his fellow unscrupulous merchants formed a "defense alliance," traveling to Nanjing twice to discuss countermeasures with corrupt elements. We all hate this kind of extremely wicked big merchant who undermined the Liberation War and demand that the government severely punish him. Shen Youcheng

    要求政府严惩奸商杜振
    编辑同志：杭州市强力汽车修理铁工厂奸商杜振，贪图暴利，破坏解放战争。一九五零年二月，浙江军区某兵团机械处向杜振定制某项用具二千个。杜振知道这是解放舟山群岛的用品，就乘机欺诈，每个要价二十万元，但以十万元一个的价钱转包给上海一个小铁工厂，从中盗骗了二亿元。这批用具的质料很差，其中百分之六十是废品。同月，他又向浙江军区承接军用洋锹二千多把，每把九万二千元。他又施故技，以每把七万零八百元的价格包给某厂，一下子又捞了五千多万元。这批洋锹很多是次货，一用就坏。他在承包军区洋镐、大刀等活中，也是层层转包和偷工减料。反贪污、反行贿运动开始后，杜振和同伙奸商订立“攻守同盟”，两次赶到南京和贪污分子商讨对策。对这种罪大恶极破坏解放战争的大奸商，我们都切齿痛恨，要求政府予以严厉制裁。  沈有成
