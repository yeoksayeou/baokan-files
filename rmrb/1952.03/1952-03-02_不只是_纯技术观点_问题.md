Not Just a Matter of "Purely Technical Viewpoint"
    Ji Chuyang

    "What is the meaning of education?" Kalinin once said to rural school teachers who were awarded medals: "It is to influence the psychology and moral character of students. During the entire ten years of study, students should be influenced in a certain direction, that is, to mold students into people." (See "On Communist Education," page 65)

    But with what kind of "concept" are some of our teachers "influencing the psychology and moral character of students"? For example, a civil engineering professor often says to students with an air of self-importance: "If you master reinforced concrete, you can go anywhere in the world. I rely on this skill to make a living!"

    Our institutions of higher learning, as stated in the decision proposed and adopted at the First National Higher Education Conference, are places "to cultivate high-level national construction talents with a high level of culture, mastering modern science and technology, and wholeheartedly serving the people through an educational method that unifies theory and practice." Our Party and the People's Government tirelessly care about our higher education and higher education teachers precisely for these reasons.

    But if some of our teachers treat the school as merely a place to "learn skills to make a living," what kind of "people" and "talents" will they "mold" and "cultivate" from those growing young students? Listen to a popular saying among young students: "If you learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry well, you won't be afraid of anyone." This means that as long as you "master reinforced concrete" or "learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry well," you can not only "go anywhere in the world" and have food to eat, but you also "won't be afraid" whether the Kuomintang or the imperialists come, and you can still have food to eat. Is this the result of some of our teachers "influencing the psychology and moral character of students"? Is this the purpose of our institutions of higher learning "molding" and "cultivating" "people" and "talents"?

    Some people say this is just a "purely technical viewpoint." But this "purely technical viewpoint" can "cultivate" a young student into a "wage laborer of the bourgeoisie," and it can also "mold" a young student into a traitor who has no national integrity and betrays his own country and people. Therefore, this is not just a matter of a "purely technical viewpoint." Because this "purely technical viewpoint" does not promote or lead young students to tend towards revolution and dedicate their labor to the people and serve our motherland; but instead encourages bourgeois individualism and promotes the idea of "whoever provides the milk is my mother."

    Therefore, the "viewpoint" itself should be said to include a fundamental question. This question is: Is our education training money-grubbing lackeys and subservient slaves for the bourgeoisie and the international bourgeoisie? Or do we want to cultivate outstanding cadres for our country who not only possess certain construction skills but also have a high degree of revolutionary consciousness and are infinitely loyal to the cause of the working people? This question must be clarified.

    不只是“纯技术观点”问题
    纪初阳
    “教育是什么意思呢？”加里宁曾对荣受勋章的乡村学校教师说过：“这就是影响学生们的心理和道德面貌，要在整整十年的学习期间内从一定方向上影响学生，也就是说，要把学生造就成人。”（见“论共产主义教育”第六十五页）
    可是我们有些教师，是用怎样一种“观念”在“影响学生们的心理和道德面貌”的呢？比如一个教土木的教授经常飘飘然地和学生这样说：“搞好钢筋混凝土，就可以走遍天下，我就是靠这一套本领吃饭的！”
    我们的高等学校，如在第一次全国高等教育会议上提出并通过的决定中所说：是“以理论与实际一致的教育方法，为培养具有高度文化水平的、掌握现代科学和技术的成就的、全心全意为人民服务的、高级的国家建设人材”的地方。我们的党和人民政府，所以不倦地关怀着我们的高等学校教育和高等学校的教师们，也就正是为了这些。
    但如我们有些教师那样，把学校只当成是一个“学本领吃饭”的所在，又将会把那些正在生长着的青年学生们“造就”、“培养”成为怎样的“人”和“人材”呢？请听一听在青年学生们中流行着的一句话罢：“学会数理化，谁来都不怕。”这也就是说，只要“搞好钢筋混凝土”或“学会数理化”，不仅可以“走遍天下”有饭吃，而且无论是国民党来还是帝国主义来“都不怕”，都可以有饭吃。难道这便是我们有些教师们“影响学生们的心理和道德面貌”的结果么？难道这就是我们的高等学校“造就”和“培养”“人”和“人材”的目的么？
    有人说，这只是一种“纯技术观点”。但这种 “纯技术观点”可以使一个青年学生被“培养”成为“资产阶级的雇佣”，也可以使一个青年学生被“造就”成为一个毫无民族气节的、背叛自己祖国和人民的叛徒。所以，这其实是并不止于一个“纯技术观点”的问题的。因为这种“纯技术观点”，不是推动、领导青年学生们在趋向革命、并把自己的劳动献给人民，为我们的祖国服务；而是在鼓励资产阶级的个人主义和宣传“有奶便是娘”的思想。
    所以，这“观点”的本身，还应该说是包括着一个带有根本性质的问题。这问题便是：我们的教育是在替资产阶级和国际资产阶级训练那种唯利是图的走狗和俯首贴耳的奴才呢？还是要为我们的国家培养那种既具备一定的建设技能、而又是具有高度的革命觉悟和无限忠心于劳动人民事业的优秀干部？这个问题是必须弄得清清楚楚的。
