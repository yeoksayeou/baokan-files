    The Phenomenon of Not Caring About Current Affairs Should Be Overcome

    Editor: In our school, many students do not care about current affairs. Last week, when students from our school were conducting propaganda among residents about the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, one resident asked: "What is the situation with the Korean armistice negotiations?" At the time, none of the twenty or so students were able to answer him. Another time, at a school assembly, the principal asked the students about the Korean armistice negotiations, and the result was the same. The vast majority of the three hundred or so students could not answer. Some people even hold the view that the Korean armistice negotiations are not going to succeed anyway, so why waste time looking at them. I think: Although the Korean armistice negotiations have been going on for more than half a year without success, in the process of the negotiations, American imperialism has constantly delayed and sabotaged the negotiations, which has fully exposed its aggressive face to the people of the world. We should pay close attention to the progress of the negotiations and should not take a dismissive attitude. We know that peace cannot be waited for, peace must be fought for. When the people of our country and the peace-loving people of the world work together to strive for peace, American imperialism will not dare to further expand its aggression.

    应该克服不关心时事的现象
    编辑同志：我们学校有许多同学不关心时事。上星期，我校同学向居民进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的宣传时，有一位居民问：“朝鲜停战谈判的情况怎样了？”当时，二十多个同学，没有
    一个能回答他。另一次，在学校的一个大会上，校长问同学关于朝鲜停战谈判的情况，结果也是一样，三百多同学，绝大部分都答不上来。还有人抱着这种看法：朝鲜停战谈判反正是不会成功的，何必白花时间去看它。我以为：朝鲜停战谈判虽然谈了大半年还没有成功，但是，在谈判过程中，美帝国主义不断地拖延、破坏谈判，却在全世界人民面前充分地暴露了它的侵略面目。我们应该密切注意谈判进行的情况，不应该采取漠视的态度。我们知道：和平不能去等待，和平必须去争取。我们全国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，努力争取和平，美帝国主义就不敢进一步扩大侵略。
