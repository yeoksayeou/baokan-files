    International Economic Conference Warmly Supported Worldwide
    Di Chaobai
    Since the meeting of the initiators of the International Economic Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October 1951, people from all walks of life around the world, except for the groups determined to create war, have warmly supported the convening of this conference. After nearly half a year of preparation by the Preparatory Committee, representing the major countries of the world, the official conference will open in Moscow in early April. More than 50 countries will be represented at the meeting, including industrialists, agriculturalists, businessmen, economists, engineers, trade union and cooperative personnel from various countries. This is an unprecedentedly broad international conference. Regardless of the political system of each country, and regardless of the political beliefs of each representative, they will be welcomed to attend the meeting in Moscow. Prominent newspapers in capitalist countries (including the United States), and their business representatives, are becoming increasingly fond of the convening of this conference.
    The reason why this conference has received such widespread response and support is not accidental. Just as the economic construction of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries is advancing by leaps and bounds, and the people's lives are improving day by day, the capitalist countries and the colonies and dependent countries are bound to the chariot of US imperialism, production and trade are constantly shrinking, fiscal deficits are expanding, currency values are falling, and the people's lives are declining sharply. Except for a few monopoly capitalist groups related to military preparations who are making huge profits, industrialists, technicians, freelancers, and the broad working people in various countries all feel deeply that following the imperialist policy of war preparation will lead them to the bottomless abyss of poverty and bankruptcy.
    The economic panic in the capitalist world, accelerated by the policy of war preparation, has become increasingly apparent. Because Western European countries followed the US imperialist economic blockade against the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, they could not purchase cheap grain, timber and coal from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. They were forced to purchase these important materials for life and production from US imperialism and the dollar bloc at much higher prices. Therefore, the amount of imports increased, the trade deficit expanded, and the dollar shortage became more acute. On the other hand, the products of Western European countries, such as machinery, metal equipment, chemical industry raw materials, and silk fabrics, could have been exported to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in large quantities, but now they are forced to stop production, reduce production, or be converted to military service, which has created a crisis of reduced exports and domestic inflation. In the context of shrinking production and reduced exports, the governments of the imperialist countries have to rely more and more on inflation as a source of income for expanding military preparations. Whether it is the exhaustion of the British-style gold and dollar reserves or the rapid decline of the French-style franc, the result will promote the shrinkage of domestic production and the bankruptcy of the financial economy in various countries.
    In some countries in the Far East and the Middle East, their economies have also been severely hit by embargoes and various monopolies. Since the second half of last year, tin and rubber prices have begun to fall, and the clouds of recession have enveloped countries such as Malaya, Indonesia, and Ceylon. Rice production in countries such as Burma and Thailand is far from the pre-war production level due to the heavy exploitation of farmers by various domestic and international controls. Trade between India and Pakistan, as well as trade with some other countries, is also in an abnormal state, hindering India and Pakistan from obtaining cheap raw materials, grain and industrial products, and increasing domestic living expenses and production costs. The Middle East's oil production has been severely damaged due to imperialist control and exploitation, and Middle Eastern countries are not allowed to sell their oil according to their own will and interests. All of this shows that the economies of the Far East and the Middle East have suffered serious damage due to political control and war policies.
    Even the countries of Northern Europe and Central and South America deeply feel the pain of severing trade relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. They are very impatient with the fences of the sterling area and the dollar area. They all complain about the coercion and restrictions of the United States and Britain, and shout the slogan of "opening up new markets and increasing and expanding trade with all countries."
    From the above facts, it can be seen how the artificial and unreasonable restrictions on international trade profoundly affect the economy of the capitalist world, how backward countries suffer more pain, and how the living standards of the vast people of all these countries have dropped sharply. Comparing these situations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, it is a clear contrast: the domestic economies of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all the People's Democratic countries are thriving, and the people's lives are significantly improved. The international trade between countries can serve as an example for all countries in the world, truly achieving equality and mutual benefit, and carrying out reasonable and full exchanges entirely based on the free will and legitimate interests of each country.
    Resolutely implementing a peaceful policy and developing international trade and economic cooperation are major reasons for the success of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in carrying out national economic construction and improving the people's lives. Therefore, the International Economic Conference Preparatory Committee invited economists, industrialists, agriculturalists, businessmen, engineers, trade union and cooperative personnel from all countries in the world with various different views to hold an international economic conference to discuss how to achieve peaceful cooperation through the development of economic relations between countries, and thereby seek possibilities for improving the people's living conditions. This call has received a wide response in countries around the world, even in the United States, Britain, and Japan. American bourgeoisie newspapers such as the "New York Times" and "Wall Street Journal" have unanimously emphasized the hope that this conference will expand international trade, and many industrialists are willing to go to Moscow to participate in the conference. Former British Trade Commission Chairman Wilson said: One of the conditions for improving the British economic situation is that Britain "restores its freedom to develop trade with Eastern Europe and other parts of the world, which is indispensable to the British economy." The shipping business in the Far East of Britain is in a slump due to the embargo, and British merchants in the Far East are generally dissatisfied with the embargo on our People's Republic of China. Industrialists, businessmen, financiers, engineers, and trade unions in Japan are all very interested in the International Economic Conference. Japanese newspapers such as "Asahi Shimbun", "Yomiuri Shimbun", "Tokyo Times" and "Industrial Economic News" have expressed their support for Japanese representatives to go to Moscow.
    From the reactions of the above three countries to the Moscow International Economic Conference, it is not difficult to imagine how enthusiastically other capitalist countries are responding to this conference. The number of manufacturers and bankers in France who are keen to make suggestions and offer prices to the conference far exceeds the number of French delegations planned to be sent to Moscow.
    In order to promote world peace and improve the lives of people in all countries through the rational exchange of international trade, our People's Republic of China wholeheartedly supports the convening of this conference and will do our best to make this conference achieve its due success.
    Just as the United States is clamoring about the failure of Truman's foreign aggression policy, just as the governments of Western European countries are exhausted by expanding their military forces, and just as many small and medium-sized countries have tasted the bitter fruits of the war preparation policy and are complaining, the Moscow International Economic Conference brings new hope to the people and industrialists and businessmen in the capitalist world: to lead to peace and prosperity from international economic cooperation.
    The reason why we advocate international economic cooperation and develop equal and mutually beneficial international trade regardless of political systems and political beliefs is because this is a concrete step to defend world peace at present, and a feasible step to alleviate the suffering of the people in capitalist countries and improve their living conditions.
    The central issue of the International Economic Conference will be to discuss how to promote the development of international trade. Since 1938, the rate of increase in international trade has been gradually shrinking, and the quantity and quality of food consumed by people in the United States and Britain have been gradually decreasing. What is the reason? The various restrictions and obstacles to international trade set up due to political relations are one of the main reasons. We believe that peaceful coexistence between planned economies and private enterprise countries is possible, so the expansion of trade relations is also possible. The conference will begin to conclude various trade contracts based on the actual possibilities of import and export of various countries, so that the International Economic Conference will become the starting point for expanding international trade.
    At present, capitalist countries are feeling a lack of raw materials: this is caused by the policy of war preparation and a series of measures. The conference will discuss the situation of major raw materials and food in the world and ways to overcome difficulties.
    Various technical measures related to promoting international trade, such as how to stabilize markets and prices, methods for international credit loans and development, transportation conditions, etc., will be fully exchanged in group meetings. Regarding the living conditions, wage income of people in various countries, how to use international cooperation to fight against disasters, and how to improve agricultural production, etc., there is also a need for sufficient mutual understanding and research on possible implementation methods.
    "Developing backward countries" has become a slogan of imperialist aggression. We oppose singing the development of backward countries in the posture of masters, oppose so-called "economic assistance" attached to any political terms, and advocate helping backward countries on the basis of true equality and mutual benefit, so that they can freely and autonomously utilize their materials and resources, and obtain economic development and improve their people's living standards with the sincere help of advanced countries. This issue is also one of the main topics of the conference.
    The reason why such a large-scale and meaningful international economic conference is held in Moscow is precisely because the Soviet Union is a fortress of peace, one of the major powers willing to promote international economic cooperation, and the Soviet Union can grant entry visas to representatives of all countries in the world, regardless of nationality or political beliefs, which no capitalist country can currently do.
    From the full preparation for this conference and the enthusiastic response from countries around the world, it can be predicted that this conference will have great achievements and lay the foundation for new international cooperation in the future.

    全世界热烈拥护的国际经济会议
    狄超白
    自一九五一年十月国际经济会议发起人于丹麦京城哥本哈根举行会议以来，全世界除决心制造战争的集团以外的各阶层人民，都热烈拥护这一会议的召开。经过代表世界上各主要国家的筹备委员会将近半年的筹备，正式会议将于四月初旬在莫斯科开幕。出席会议的国家将有五十多个，出席代表包括各国的实业家、农业家、商人、经济学家、工程师、工会与合作社人员。这是空前广泛的一次国际性会议。不论各个国家的政治制度如何，也不论各个代表的政治信仰如何，都将被欢迎前往莫斯科开会。资本主义各国（包括美国在内）的著名报纸，及其工商界的代表人物，他们愈来愈倾心于这个会议的召开了。
    这个会议之所以获得这样广泛的响应和拥护，不是偶然的。正当苏联及人民民主国家经济建设突飞猛晋，人民生活蒸蒸日上的时候，各资本主义国家和殖民地与附属国却被束缚在美帝国主义的战车上，生产与贸易不断萎缩，财政赤字扩大，币值下跌，人民生活急剧下降，除少数与军备有关的独占资本集团获得暴利而外，各国的工商业家、技术人员、自由职业者、广大的劳动人民，都切身地感觉到追随帝国主义的备战政策将把他们引向贫困破产的无底的深渊。
    资本主义世界因备战政策而加速的经济恐慌已愈来愈表面化了。西欧各国因为遵循美帝国主义对苏联和东欧的经济封锁，他们不能向苏联和东欧购买廉价的粮食、木材和煤，他们被迫以高出很多的价格向美帝国主义和美元集团购买这些生活和生产的重要物资。因此，输入金额增大了，逆差扩大了，美元的短缺益发尖锐化了。在另一方面，西欧各国的生产品如机器、金属器材、化学工业原料以及丝织品等，本来可以大量输出苏联及人民民主国家，现在则被迫停工减产或转化为军备服务，这就造成输出减少和国内通货膨胀的危机。各帝国主义国家的政府在生产萎缩和输出减少的情况下要进行扩张军备，其收入的来源就不得不愈来愈依赖通货膨胀。不论是英国式的黄金美元储备的枯竭和法国式的法郎迅速下跌，结果都会促使各个国家国内生产的萎缩和财政经济的破产。
    在远东和中东一些国家，他们的经济也因禁运和各种垄断而受到严重的打击。自去年下半年以来，锡、胶价格开始下跌，不景气的乌云已笼罩着马来亚、印尼、锡兰等国家；缅甸、泰国等国的大米生产，因受国内和国际的各种统制使农民受到重重剥削，生产量还远离战前的生产水平；印度与巴基斯坦之间的贸易以及与其他某些国家的贸易，也在不正常的状态中，妨碍了印度、巴基斯坦两国取得廉价的原料、粮食和工业品，提高了国内的生活费用和生产成本。中东的石油生产由于帝国主义的控制与剥削已遭到严重的破坏，并且不容许中东国家按照他们自己的意志和利益出售他们的石油。这一切，说明远东和中东国家的经济因政治控制和战争政策已遭受到了严重的破坏。
    即使是北欧和中南美洲的国家，也深深感到与苏联及人民民主国家断绝贸易关系的痛苦。他们对英镑区和美元区的藩篱已经很不耐烦，他们一致抱怨美英的强制与限制，喊出“开辟新市场，增加和扩大与一切国家的贸易”的呼声。
    从以上的事实可以知道：国际贸易的人为的不合理限制，如何深刻地影响到资本主义世界的经济，如何使落后国家遭受到更多的痛苦，并使所有这些国家的广大人民的生活水平急剧下降。把这些情况拿来与苏联、人民民主国家对比，那是一个鲜明的对照：苏联、中华人民共和国以及所有人民民主国家的国内经济无不蒸蒸日上，人民生活无不显著的提高，而各国之间的国际贸易，正可作为世界各国的范例，真正做到了平等互利，并完全根据各个国家的自由意志和正当的利益而进行合理、充分的交换。
    坚决贯彻执行和平政策、发展国际贸易和经济合作，是苏联和各人民民主国家在进行国家经济建设、改善人民生活等方面获得成功的重大原因。因此，国际经济会议筹备委员会邀请世界各国的具有各种不同见解的经济学家、实业家、农业家、商人、工程师、工会与合作社人员举行国际经济会议，以讨论如何经由发展各国间的经济关系来实现和平合作，并由此来寻求改善人民生活状况的可能性的这一号召，在世界各国获得了广泛的响应，即使是美国、英国、日本都不例外。美国资产阶级的报纸如“纽约时报”、“华尔街日报”等都一致强调希望通过这次会议能扩展国际贸易，并有许多实业家愿意前往莫斯科参加会议。英国前贸易委员会主席威尔逊说道：改善英国经济局面的一个条件是英国“恢复其与东欧及全世界其他部分发展贸易的自由，这种贸易自由对英国经济是不可缺少的。”英国在远东的航运事业因禁运而生意萧条，英国的远东商人普遍地不满对我中华人民共和国的禁运。日本的工商业家、金融家、工程师、工会，都对国际经济会议发生莫大的兴趣，日本的报纸如“朝日新闻”、“读卖新闻”、“东京时报”和“产业经济新闻”，都表示支持日本代表前往莫斯科。
    从上述三个国家对莫斯科国际经济会议的反应中，不难想见其他资本主义国家更是如何热烈地响应这个会议。法国热心于向大会提建议和开行情的制造商和银行家，远远的超过计划中要派赴莫斯科的法国代表团的人数。
    我中华人民共和国为了促进世界和平，为了通过国际贸易的合理交流来提高各国人民的生活，我们衷心地拥护这个会议的召开，并尽我们的可能来使这个会议获得其应有的成就。
    正当美国内部喧嚷杜鲁门的对外侵略政策失败的时候，正当西欧各国政府为了扩军而精疲力竭的时候，正当许多中小国家尝到备战政策底恶果而怨声载道的时候，莫斯科国际经济会议给资本主义世界人民及工商业家带来新的希望：从国际经济合作来导向和平与繁荣。
    我们所以提倡国际经济合作，提倡不问政治制度和政治信仰而发展平等互利的国际贸易，因为这乃是目前保卫世界和平的具体步骤，是减轻资本主义世界各国人民的痛苦和改善其人民生活状况底可行步骤。
    国际经济会议的中心问题将讨论如何促进国际贸易的发展。自一九三八年以来，国际贸易的增加率在逐步萎缩中，美英等国人民消费的食物的量与质都在逐渐减低。其原因何在？因政治关系而设的种种国际贸易的限制和障碍是其主要原因之一。我们相信计划经济的国家与私人企业国家间的和平共处是可能的，因此贸易关系的扩大也是可能的。会议将根据各国输出输入的实际可能，开始订立各种贸易合同，使国际经济会议成为扩大国际贸易的行动起点。
    目前资本主义国家都在感到原料的缺乏：这乃是备战政策及其一系列的措施所引起的。会议将讨论世界主要原料及粮食的情况和克服困难的方法。
    与促进国际贸易有关的各种技术性措施，如怎样稳定市场及价格，关于国际信用贷款及发展的办法，运输条件等等，都将在分组会议中充分的交换意见。关于各国人民的生活状况，工资收入，怎样用国际合作来与灾荒斗争，以及怎样改进农业生产等等问题，也需要相互间有足够的了解和研究可能的施行办法。
    “开发落后国家”已经成为帝国主义侵略的一个口号。我们反对以主人的姿态来高唱开发落后国家，反对附以任何政治条款的所谓“经济援助”，主张在真正平等互利的基础上帮助落后国家，使他们能够自由自主地利用其物资与资源，在先进国家的真诚帮助之下获得经济上的发展并提高其人民生活水平。这一问题，也是会议的主要议题之一。
    这样一次规模宏大意义深长的国际经济会议，所以选定莫斯科为开会地点，正是因为苏联是和平的堡垒，是愿意促进国际经济合作的主要大国之一，并且，苏联能够不问国别不问政治信仰，给全世界各国的代表以入境的签证，这是目前任何资本主义国家所不能做到的。
    从这次会议筹备的充分，以及全世界各国的热烈响应来看，可以预料到这次会议会有伟大的成就，而为今后新的国际合作奠立基础。
