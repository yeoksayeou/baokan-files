    Monopoly and Merger
    -- Another Record of the Sinister Activities of the Chongqing "Star Four Dinner Party"
    By our reporter, Lin Li
    While investigating the case of the "Star Four Dinner Party," I have been constantly enraged by the wild ambitions of this gang of thieves. These extremely rampant capitalists not only dared to steal state property secretly but in an organized and planned manner, dared to blatantly exclude and attack state-owned enterprises, and also to merge and crush small and medium-sized private factories. They妄想妄想to develop into monopolistic capitalists controlling the national economy and people's livelihood in the new China.
    The leading figures of the "Star Four Dinner Party" have repeatedly discussed "public-private relations." In the resolution of the third meeting of the association, it was openly written: "If the 'division of public and private tasks is not clear', private enterprises 'cannot produce with peace of mind'." However, how did the member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" handle public-private relations?
    Here, the example of the Zhendan Fire Extinguisher Factory can be cited.
    Zhendan Fire Extinguisher Factory is one of the member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party". Its head office is located in Shanghai, and its distribution offices and branches are all over major cities in the country. This factory has always monopolized the production of fire extinguishing equipment in China. In the Southwest region, Zhendan is even more dominant. Since liberation, various economic construction undertakings in the Southwest region have developed rapidly, and urban fire protection facilities have also greatly increased. The production volume of Zhendan Fire Extinguisher Factory has been unable to meet the needs of the market. Therefore, state-owned enterprises decided to open the "Forward Fire Extinguisher Factory". The capitalists of Zhendan heard the news and immediately decided to implement a "complete blockade" against state-owned enterprises. Chongqing lacked skilled workers to manufacture fire extinguishing equipment, and the capitalists of Zhendan seized on this point and pulled the workers scattered in the local area to their own factory. They said basely and insidiously to those workers who were preparing to work at the Forward Factory: "Our wages are high here, and we can also share dividends after making money. Come to our factory!" In this short period, the number of workers at the Zhendan factory suddenly increased by more than two times. Around the Zhendan factory, there were more than a dozen small factories specializing in the manufacture of fire extinguisher parts. The capitalists of Zhendan were afraid that these small factories would accept processing orders from state factories, so they tried every means to "persuade" the small factories to "cooperate" with them. Some small factories saw through this as a "big fish eats small fish" trick and resolutely refused. After this conspiracy of the Zhendan factory failed, it immediately began the second "attack". It handed over huge processing tasks to the small factories, requiring them to complete them in the shortest possible time. In this way, on the one hand, the small factories had no strength to accept orders from state factories; on the other hand, when the small factories could not deliver the goods on time, they were forced to submit. It used this vicious method to merge more than a dozen small factories one after another. At the same time, the Zhendan factory massively searched the Chongqing market for raw materials for manufacturing fire extinguishing equipment such as copper, sulfuric acid, calcium carbide, and paint, and sent special personnel to Chengdu to抢购抢购 copper materials, attempting to completely control the raw materials for fire extinguishing equipment. During this period, the copper materials acquired by the Zhendan factory were enough for several years. However, no matter how much the Zhendan factory "completely blockaded", the state-owned Forward Fire Extinguisher Factory was still successfully established and produced in large quantities. The capitalists of the Zhendan factory organized a new offensive. When the first batch of products from the Forward Fire Extinguisher Factory came on the market, the capitalists of the Zhendan factory spread rumors and slanders on the one hand, and on the other hand, reduced the selling price of fire extinguishers from 280,000 yuan to 240,000 yuan, attempting to squeeze the products of the Forward Fire Extinguisher Factory out of the market. Rampant attacks on state-owned enterprises, this is the "public-private relationship" that the "Star Four Dinner Party" wants to create.
    If these "big families" do not crush or merge small and medium-sized private enterprises, they cannot do whatever they want. At the secret gatherings of the "Star Four Dinner Party," these illegal capitalists have discussed the relationship between industries more than once. They use all kinds of卑鄙无耻卑鄙无耻 means to control the machinery, equipment and manpower of small and medium-sized factories in their hands. They say that this is to "take care of" the "interests" of small and medium-sized factories. Over the years, the member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" have relied on their advantages in production equipment and huge organizational strength to form an absolute monopoly on private industries; at the same time, through the "informers" they placed in state-owned enterprises and government agencies, they formed a monopoly network for state processing orders. Small and medium-sized enterprises cannot get government processing orders without going through them; the right to allocate large amounts of processing orders from state-owned enterprises has been almost completely篡夺篡夺 by the "Star Four Dinner Party". At the end of 1951, the "Star Four Dinner Party" obtained the processing order figures for 1952 from the Southwest Industrial Department, and immediately set up a processing order distribution group within it, with the chief member Gao Gongmao personally serving as the leader. Gao Gongmao first "allocated" more than 200 of the more than 400 processing orders to his own Minsheng Machinery Factory, then let the member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party" choose, and finally allocated the processed products that they considered unprofitable to more than 200 small and medium-sized factories. Before this, the processing orders of state-owned enterprises were also first distributed to large factories by the "Star Four Dinner Party", large factories subcontracted to medium-sized factories, and medium-sized factories then subcontracted to small factories. This process of layer-by-layer subcontracting is also a process of layer-by-layer exploitation.
    At the beginning of 1951, Wu Zongkai and Yin Renji, the leading figures of the "Star Four Dinner Party", obtained the processing rights for 30,000 straight-foot screws from state-owned enterprises. The state stipulated that the processing fee for each screw was 6,500 yuan. They subcontracted part of it to 18 small factories, giving them only 4,500 yuan in processing fees. Mao Yike, another member of the "Star Four Dinner Party", accepted 40 million yuan in processing orders from the state. He would not manufacture this batch of orders at all, but he subcontracted it to several small factories at a low price of 17 million yuan. In the transfer, he obtained much more profit than the direct producers. Therefore, some members of the "Star Four Dinner Party", such as Wu Zongkai, no longer operate factories at all, but specialize in the business of "eating overwater". This kind of cruel exploitation is feudal in nature. This is the "care" of the "Star Four Dinner Party" for small and medium-sized industries.
    In the past half year, the strength of the "Star Four Dinner Party" has become stronger, and it has further launched an attack on small and medium-sized industries, simply eating them or squeezing them out. There are two methods of eating them, "soft eating" and "hard eating". "Soft eating" is to use a certain profit as bait, deliberately distributing too many processed products to small factories that exceed their equipment capacity, and setting a very short time for delivery. When the small factories cannot deliver the goods, they force the small factories to move to the large factories with people and machines, and also say that this is to allow the small factories to use the equipment of the large factories to "catch up" with the tasks. At this time, the large factories use various means to buy the machines and workers of the small factories to achieve the purpose of merging the small factories. The method of "hard eating" is to desperately lower the price when distributing tasks to small factories, forcing small factories to profit from偷工减料偷工减料. At this time, they instigated the state inspection personnel to ask the small factories to rework or compensate for losses. They took the opportunity to buy the factory buildings and machines of the small factories. Using these卑鄙龌龊卑鄙龌龊 means, the Shanghai Machine Factory bought the machines of the Fangxingfa Factory; the Xinmin Machine Factory contracted all the equipment of the Gongyi Factory; and the Yuxin Steel Factory ate seven small factories by itself.
    The group of illegal capitalists of the "Star Four Dinner Party" treat the people's government with "ingratitude", and treat private industries with "bullying the weak". According to the statistics of the Steel and Machinery Industry Association: Before liberation, all the steel and machinery factories in Chongqing were destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits. In the early days of liberation, none of the remaining 160 factories had the strength to start production. However, with the strong support of the people's government, the recovery speed of Chongqing's steel and machinery industry has surpassed any period in history. In order to support private industrial production, the state bank lent enough money to ten member factories of the "Star Four Dinner Party", such as Yuxin, Hengshun, Dalai, Xinmin, Shunchang, Huigong, Shanghai, Ronghua, Zhendan, and Cooperation, to办办 factories of the same scale and the same quantity. In the two years, the total value of processing orders given to Chongqing's private steel and machinery industry by the state was more than 300 billion yuan. The capitalists of the steel and machinery industry have made a fortune from it. By June 1951, there were a total of 418 steel and machinery factories in the city, an increase of 2.4 times compared to the early days of liberation. The Yuxin Steel Factory, which had less than 300 employees in the early days of liberation, now has 1,200 employees. Factories such as Xinmin, Dalai, Cooperation, Shunchang, and Hongfali have also developed from five, six, or ten people in the early days of liberation to one or two hundred people now. In this leap of ten or twenty times, the "Star Four Dinner Party" used monopoly and exclusive methods to merge many small and medium-sized factories. According to the investigation of the Steel and Machinery Industry Association, the original Chongqing steel and machinery industry, which had developed to more than 400 factories, only had 312 factories left by September 1951, and now there are less than 280. The reason why one-third of the factories closed down was all due to the direct merger and indirect squeezing out by the "Star Four Dinner Party". However, the illegal capitalists of the "Star Four Dinner Party" are not satisfied yet. Before the anti-bribery campaign was launched, Gao Gongmao and Wu Zongkai, in the name of the Southwest Industrial Department, said to Lin Shiqi, the deputy manager of Zhendan Fire Extinguisher Factory: The government is preparing to "merge small factories into large factories", "small bourgeois capitalists should participate in production, and Chongqing's steel and machinery factories can only have seven or eighty factories at most". Lin Shiqi is also a member of the "Star Four Dinner Party". He took this "plan" and publicized it everywhere, calling on "everyone to respond to the government's call", "organize joint ventures", and "expand production", which caused great chaos among small and medium-sized factories and dissatisfaction with the people's government. The ambitions of the illegal capitalists of the "Star Four Dinner Party" are getting bigger and bigger. In the early days, they openly demanded to grasp the secrets and various engineering blueprints of the Southwest economic construction, and now they are going to "develop to Beijing and other regions". However, the great anti-theft campaign has shattered the ambitions of the illegal capitalists of the "Star Four Dinner Party". Their sins have been very serious, and they will have to taste the bitter fruit today.

    垄断和并吞
    ——再记重庆“星四聚餐会”的罪恶活动
    本报记者  林里
    在采访“星四聚餐会”的案件时，我一直为这伙盗窃犯的狂妄野心所激愤。这群猖狂透顶的资本家，他们不但敢于偷偷地但是有组织有计划地盗窃国家资财，敢于明目张胆地排斥、打击国营企业，并且吞并、挤垮中小私营工厂。他们妄想在新中国发展成操纵国计民生的独占资本家。
    “星四聚餐会”的首脑分子曾经多次讨论“公私关系”。在该会第三次会议的决议上，公然写道： “不把‘公私任务划分清楚’，私营企业就‘不能安心生产’”。然而，“星四聚餐会”的会员厂是如何处理公私关系的呢？
    这里，可以举出震旦灭火器材厂的例子。
    震旦灭火器材厂是“星四聚餐会”的会员厂之一。它的总公司设在上海，它的经销处和分公司遍布全国各大城市。这个厂一直垄断着我国灭火器材的生产。在西南区，震旦更是独霸一方。解放以来，西南区各种经济建设事业突飞猛进，城市防火设备也大为增加。震旦灭火器材厂的生产量已不能满足市场的需要。因此，国家企业机关决定开办“前进灭火器材厂”。震旦的资本家听到这个消息，立刻决定对国营企业实行“全面封锁”。重庆缺乏制造灭火器材的技术工人，震旦的资本家就抓住这一点，把分散在当地的工人拉到自己的厂里。他们卑鄙而阴险地对那些准备到前进工厂工作的工人说：“我们这里工资高，赚了钱还可以分红，到我们厂里来吧！”在这短短的期间，震旦厂的工人突然增加两倍多。震旦厂的周围，原有十多家专做灭火器材零件的小工厂。震旦的资本家害怕这些小厂接受国家工厂的加工定货，便千方百计地“劝导”小厂和它“合营”。有些小厂看透了这是“大鱼吃小鱼”的诡计，就坚决拒绝了。震旦厂的这一阴谋失败后，立即开始第二个“进攻”。它把庞大的加工任务交给小厂，要它们在最短期间完成。这样，一方面使小厂没有力量接受国家工厂的定货；另一方面，又在小厂不能按时交货的时候，强逼小厂就范。它用这个恶毒的方法，先后吞并了十多家小工厂。与此同时，震旦厂大量搜购重庆市场上的铜、硫酸、电石、喷漆制造灭火器具的原料，并派专人去成都抢购铜料，企图完全把灭火器材的原料控制起来。就在这个时期，震旦厂收购的铜料足够几年之用。但是，不管震旦厂如何“全面封锁”，国营前进灭火器材厂还是创建成功了，并且大量生产了。震旦厂的资本家又组织了新的进攻。当前进灭火器材厂第一批产品上市时，震旦厂的资本家一面造谣诬蔑；一面把灭火机的售价由二十八万元降到二十四万元，企图把前进灭火器材厂的产品挤出市场。对国营企业猖狂进攻，这就是“星四聚餐会”所要造成的“公私关系”。
    不挤垮或吞并私营中小企业，这些“大家”是不能为所欲为的。在“星四聚餐会”的秘密集会上，这些不法资本家不止一次地讨论过同业之间的关系。他们用各种卑鄙无耻的手段，把中小工厂的机器设备和人力掌握在自己的手里。他们说，这是为了
    “照顾”中小工厂的“利益”。历年来，“星四聚餐会”会员厂仗恃着它们在生产设备上的优势和庞大的组织力量，形成了对私营同业的绝对垄断；同时，通过它们在国营企业和政府机关里所安置的“坐探”，组成了对国家加工定货的垄断网。中小企业不通过它们，就得不到政府的加工定货；国营企业大量的加工定货的分配权，几乎完全被“星四聚餐会”所篡夺。一九五一年底，“星四聚餐会”得到了西南工业部一九五二年的加工定货数字，立即在它内部，设立了加工定货分配组，由首脑分子高功懋亲自担任组长。高功懋在四百多种加工定货中，首先“分配”给他自己的民生机器厂二百多种，然后让“星四聚餐会”各会员厂挑选，最后把他们认为无利可图的加工品，分配给二百多家中小工厂。在这以前，国营企业的加工定货，也是先经“星四聚餐会”分配给大厂，大厂转包给中厂，中厂再转包给小厂。这个层层转包的过程，也就是层层剥削的过程。
    一九五一年初，“星四聚餐会”的首脑分子吴宗楷和印仁基，从国营企业揽到三万个直脚螺丝的加工权利。国家规定每个螺丝的加工费为六千五百元。他们把其中一部分转包给十八家小厂，只给加工费四千五百元。“星四聚餐会”另一会员毛毅可，接受了国家四千万元的加工定货，这批定货，他是根本不会制造的，但他用一千七百万元的低价，转包给若干家小工厂。转手之间，获得比直接生产者多得多的利润。因此，“星四聚餐会”中的某些分子，如吴宗楷等，现在根本不再经营工厂，而专干“吃过水”的勾当了。这种残酷剥削是带有封建性的，这就是“星四聚餐会”对于中小同业的“照顾”。
    近半年来，“星四聚餐会”的力量雄厚了，它进一步向中小同业展开进攻，干脆把它们吃掉或挤垮。吃掉的方法，有“软吃”和“硬吃”两种。“软吃”是以一定的利润作钓饵，故意分给小厂过多的超过其设备能力的加工品，并且限定很短时间交货。到时小厂交不了货，就强迫小厂连人带机器搬到大厂中，还说这是让小厂利用大厂的设备“赶”任务。这时，大厂便用种种手段，收买小厂的机器和工人，达到吞并小厂的目的。“硬吃”的方法，是在分给小厂任务时，拚命把价钱压低，迫使小工厂从偷工减料中取利。这时，他们就挑动国家验收人员，要小厂返工重做或赔偿损失。他们即乘机收买小厂的厂房和机器。就用这些卑鄙龌龊的手段，上海机器厂收买了方兴发厂的机器；新民机器厂包下了公益厂的全部设备；渝鑫钢铁厂一家就吃掉了七个小工厂。
    “星四聚餐会”的一群不法资本家对待人民政府是“以怨报德”，对待私营的同业是“恃强凌弱”。据钢铁机器业公会统计：解放以前，重庆钢铁机器厂全被国民党匪帮摧毁，解放初期，仅余的一百六十来家，没有一家有力量开工生产。但在人民政府大力扶植下，重庆钢铁机器业的恢复速度超过了历史上的任何时期。为了扶植私营工业生产，国家银行贷给“星四聚餐会”的会员厂渝鑫、恒顺、大来、新民、顺昌、惠工、上海、荣华、震旦、合作等十家的款额，就足够与办同样规模和同等数量的工厂。二年以来国家交给重庆私营钢铁机器业的加工定货，总值在三千亿元以上。钢铁机器业的资本家，都从中发了大财。到一九五一年六月，全市钢铁机器厂共四百十八家，比解放初期增加了二点四倍。解放初期不足三百名职工的渝鑫钢铁厂，现有一千二百名职工。新民、大来、合作、顺昌、洪发利等厂，也由解放初期的五、六人或十多人，发展到现在的一、二百人。在这十倍二十倍的飞跃发展中，“星四聚餐会”用垄断和独占的方法，吞并了许多中小工厂。据钢铁机器公会调查，原来发展到四百多家的重庆钢铁机器业，到一九五一年九月，只剩下三百十二家，现在则已不足二百八十家。三分之一的工厂所以倒闭，全是被“星四聚餐会”直接并吞和间接挤垮的。然而，“星四聚餐会”的不法资本家还不满足。在反行贿运动开展以前，高功懋和吴宗楷假借西南工业部名义，向震旦灭火器材厂副经理林式棨说：政府准备“把小厂都并入大厂”、“小资产阶级的资方应该参加生产，重庆的钢铁机器厂至多只能剩七、八十家”。林式棨也是“星四聚餐会”的会员之一，他拿着这个“计划”，到处宣传，要“大家响应政府号召”、“组织联营”、“扩大生产”以致引起中小工厂极大混乱和对人民政府的不满。“星四聚餐会”的不法资本家的野心是越来越大的。初期，他们曾经公开要求掌握西南经济建设的机密和各种工程蓝图，现在他们又要向“北京和外区发展”了。但是，伟大的反盗窃运动，粉碎了“星四聚餐会”不法资本家的野心。他们的罪孽已经十分严重，他们今天要自食其果了。
