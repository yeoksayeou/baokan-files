Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: London Dispatch: The British House of Commons resumed its foreign policy debate, which had been interrupted by the death of the British monarch, on February 26th. Faced with the powerful movement of the British people against war policies, the Conservative and Labour parties were extremely embarrassed, shifting responsibility for the war obligations to the United States in a conspiracy to invade China. However, the squabbling over shifting responsibility precisely proves that both the Conservative and Labour parties are merely loyal accomplices of the American aggressors.

As everyone knows, on January 17th of this year, British Conservative Prime Minister Winston Churchill delivered a shameless speech in the U.S. Congress to please his American masters. In this speech, Churchill obsequiously echoed his American masters, intimidating the Chinese and Korean people by saying that if the Korean armistice were disrupted, Britain would support the United States in taking "swift, resolute, and effective" action. This public announcement that the Conservative government was succumbing to the American attempt to expand the Korean War policy aroused strong opposition from the British people, causing a great uproar in domestic public opinion. Even the conservative "Times" demanded "clarification" of Churchill's remarks. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, Churchill quickly made a vague statement, claiming that he had not undertaken any "specific or formal obligations."

Amidst the British people's condemnation of Churchill, the Labour Party, which failed in the general election last October because of its insistence on following the United States in expanding its arms race, took the opportunity to attack the Conservative Party, impeaching Churchill's statement in an attempt to regain some political capital. In the debate on the 26th, Labour's former Foreign Secretary Morrison even pretentiously expressed doubt whether Churchill's speech indicated a change in policy and expressed concern that "Britain might be dragged into the serious danger of a general war without proper consultation." However, Morrison clearly knows that it is not the Conservative Party that has changed the policies of its predecessor Labour government, nor does the Labour Party have its own fundamental policies that differ from the Conservative Party. Precisely because of this, Morrison's attack was limited to vague hints and criticisms.

Churchill's reply greatly embarrassed the Labour Party. He said that it was Attlee and Morrison who twice accepted the demand to support the United States in seeking opportunities to expand the war action in May and September of last year. First, they promised the United States that if the U.S. and British invading forces were subjected to fierce air raids, Britain would participate in "combat operations outside the Korean region"; later, they agreed to support the United States in "taking some more unrestricted action" after the armistice negotiations broke down. As for Churchill himself, according to Churchill, he was "merely following the policies set by the previous government." However, Churchill himself immediately proved that his attempt to shirk responsibility was also to divert the people's opposition to his government's following of the American war policy. Obviously, fearing to cause misunderstanding among his American masters, Churchill, after exposing the fact that the Labour government had undertaken Washington's war obligations, quickly stated: "The present government believes that the Labour government's decisions in these two incidents were correct." And in his reply, he repeatedly stated that Britain's policy on the Korean War "has not changed at all." In fact, the previous Labour government basically implemented the reactionary policies of the Conservative Party headed by Churchill.

After Churchill unceremoniously exposed the Labour Party's shameful secrets, Labour leader Attlee had to admit that this was the case, but he still tried to conceal his ugly face and claimed that the Labour government's two promises "did not deviate from the general policy of limiting the war to the Korean theater."

Regardless of what arguments and explanations the Conservative and Labour parties make regarding the British government's consistent pursuit of the adventurous policies of the American aggressors, one thing is certain: both parties are loyally acting as accomplices of the United States. The main theme of Churchill's speech to the U.S. Congress was to express this sentiment, and Labour's Morrison also eagerly stated in this questioning of Churchill: "No one wants to maintain warm and good relations with the United States more than we do."

This British Parliament's foreign policy debate exposed the despicable faces of the Conservative and Labour parties as being birds of a feather. It also further illustrates that the British ruling group, which pursues American war policies, has become increasingly fragile and chaotic under the strong opposition of the broad masses of people.

    惧怕在人民面前承认充当美国阴谋侵略中国的帮凶
    英议会中保守党和工党互相攻讦乱作一团
    关于外交政策争吵结果证明两党都是美国的忠实奴仆
    【新华社五日讯】伦敦消息：英国议会下院因英王逝世而中断的外交政策辩论，于二月二十六日起继续进行。在英国人民反对战争政策的有力运动面前，保守党和工党十分狼狈，互相推诿对美国承担阴谋侵略中国的战争义务的责任。但是双方在互相推诿责任的争吵中，恰恰证明保守党和工党同样只是美国侵略者的忠实帮凶。
    大家知道，今年一月十七日，英国保守党政府首相邱吉尔曾在美国国会发表了一篇讨好其美国主人的无耻演说。在这篇演说里，邱吉尔奴颜婢膝地为他的美国主人帮腔，恫吓中朝人民说：一旦朝鲜停战受到破坏，英国将支持美国采取“迅速、坚决而且有效的”行动。这一公开宣布保守党政府屈从美国企图扩大侵朝战争政策的演说，激起英国人民的强烈反对，使国内舆论大哗，连保守的“泰晤士报”也要求“澄清”邱吉尔的谈话。邱吉尔看见势头不妙，赶紧含糊其词地声明并未承担任何“具体的或正式的义务”。
    在英国广大人民声讨邱吉尔声中，在去年十月因为坚持追随美国扩军备战而在大选中失败的工党，乘机攻击保守党，对邱吉尔的声明提出弹劾，企图借此捞回一些政治资本。在二十六日的辩论中，工党前任外交大臣莫里逊更装腔作势地表示怀疑邱吉尔演说是否表示政策已有了改变。并表示担心“英国会不经过适当的协商就被拖入普遍战争的严重危险”。但是莫里逊清楚地知道，既不是什么保守党改变了它前任工党政府的政策，也不是工党有其自己与保守党相异的基本政策。正因为如此，所以莫里逊的攻击仅限于暧昧含糊的暗示和批评。
    邱吉尔的回答使工党十分难堪，他说：正是艾德礼和莫里逊在去年五月和九月两次接受了支持美国伺机扩大战争行动的要求，先是向美国应承，如果美英侵略军受到猛烈空袭，英国愿参加“在朝鲜地区以外的作战”；后来又同意支持美国在停战谈判破裂后“采取某种较为不受限制的行动”。至于邱吉尔自己，据邱吉尔说：“不过遵循着前任政府定下的政策”而已。但是，邱吉尔自己立即证明他这样推卸责任，也是为了转移人民对他的政府追随美国战争政策的反对。显然是由于深怕引起美国主人的误会，邱吉尔在暴露了工党政府承担华盛顿的战争义务的事实之后，就赶紧声明：“本政府认为工党政府在这两次事件上的决定都是正确的。”并且在他的答辩中一再声明，英国对朝鲜战争的政策“完全没有改变”。事实上，前任工党政府基本上也是执行着以邱吉尔为首的保守党的反动政策。
    在邱吉尔不客气地揭穿工党的可耻的隐秘之后，工党首领艾德礼不得不承认确有其事，但他仍然企图掩饰自己的丑恶面目，竟表示工党政府的两次承诺，“并没有离开把战争限于朝鲜战区的总政策”。
    不论保守党和工党对于英国政府始终追随美国侵略者从事冒险的政策作什么样的争辩和解释，有一点是肯定的，就是两党都忠心地充当美国的帮凶。邱吉尔美国国会演说的主旨就是表白这一心意，而工党的莫里逊在这次对邱吉尔的责问中也唯恐怠慢地声明：“没有人会比我们更希望和美国保持热诚和良好的关系。”
    英国议会这次外交政策辩论，暴露了保守党和工党原是一丘之貉的可鄙面目。也进一步说明了：奉行美国战争政策的英国统治集团，已在广大人民的强烈反对下变得越来越脆弱和混乱了。
