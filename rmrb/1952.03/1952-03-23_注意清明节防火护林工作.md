    Pay attention to Fire Prevention and Forest Protection during the Qingming Festival
    Comrade Editor: The Qingming Festival is approaching. In the past, people in various places often caused mountain fires due to burning paper money and tin foil, lighting incense and candles, and setting off firecrackers when visiting graves, causing serious damage to forests. For example, last spring, Tang Youming of Wopu Village, District 3, Longhua County, Rehe Province, caused a mountain fire while burning paper money at a grave. The masses who were cutting grass on the mountain at the time were unable to escape and two were burned to death, two were injured, and the fire was extinguished after burning for a day, burning a total of seven mountain gullies and destroying more than 600 mu of firewood forest. Another example is Lu Dingshi of Erxiang Township, Jing County, Hunan Province, who caused a fire by burning paper money at a grave, destroying more than 50,000 tea trees. I think cadres in various places should educate the peasants that it is not necessary to burn paper money, light incense and candles, or set off firecrackers, because these are superstitious and wasteful behaviors. Investing this money in production is beneficial to both oneself and the country. I also hope that village cadres, farmers' associations, and forest protection organizations in various regions will carry out forest protection propaganda and education well before the Qingming Festival, so as to prevent mountain fires caused by the masses burning paper when visiting graves.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Li Yihua's opinion is very important. Cadres in areas near mountains and forests should thoroughly educate the masses on forest protection and fire prevention, and ensure that mountain fires are not caused by burning paper when visiting graves during the Qingming Festival.

### 注意清明节防火护林工作

    注意清明节防火护林工作
    编辑同志：清明节就要到来，以往各地人民由于上坟烧纸钱锡箔，燃香烛，放鞭炮，常常引起山火，使林木遭受到严重的损失。例如去年春季热河省隆化县三区窝铺村唐有明上坟烧纸，引起山火。当时在山上割草的群众因来不及逃跑，被烧死二人，烧伤二人，火烧了一天才被扑灭，共烧了七道山凹，烧毁柴山六百多亩。又如湖南省靖县二乡卢丁氏上坟烧纸，引起火灾，烧毁茶树五万余株。我认为各地干部应该教育农民，不必烧纸钱、燃香烛、放鞭炮等，因为这都是一种迷信和浪费行为。把这笔钱投入生产，对自己对国家都是有利的。并希望各地区村干部、农会及护林组织，在清明节前，好好进行护林宣传教育，以免群众上坟烧纸时引起林火。    李一化
    编者按：李一化同志这个意见非常重要。各靠近山林地区的干部，要深入教育群众，护林防火，并要保证在清明节上坟时，不因上坟烧纸引起山林火灾。
