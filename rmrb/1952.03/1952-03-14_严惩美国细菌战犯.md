    Sternly Punish the American Bacterial Warfare Criminals
    Dong Qiushi, Head of the Propaganda Department of the China Association for Promoting Democracy
    American imperialists, in their aggression against Korea, suffered a bloody nose. Their atomic blackmail was exposed, and their so-called "air and sea superiority" is nothing but empty talk that defies reality. This paper tiger can be said to have been completely unmasked before the people of the world. Imperialists are, by nature, international gangsters, and gangsters will never admit defeat. Their methods can only become more and more despicable, finally extinguishing humanity and not even reaching the level of beasts, simply turning into poisonous bacteria. The only way to deal with bacteria is to exterminate them.
    The use of bacteriological weapons is prohibited by international law and conventions. This provision is entirely in line with justice and is therefore supported by the people of the world. Whoever violates this provision will inevitably become the enemy of the people of the world. For this reason, even the most vicious fascists in the past did not dare to openly use this weapon. Now, American imperialists are not only using it on the Korean front, but also against peaceful residents in the rear, and even extending its use to within our borders. The scope is so large, and the evidence is so plentiful, that no matter how good American imperialists are at creating rumors and denying them, how can they deny it?
    The use of bacteriological weapons by American imperialists is already proven, a case as solid as a mountain. The question now is how to deal with it. The solution is very simple: exterminate the users of the bacteria along with the bacteria themselves. Just as we have sufficient power to exterminate the bacteria spread by the enemy, we also have sufficient power to exterminate the users of the bacteria, because justice is on our side, and the people of the world with a sense of justice are on our side.
    This monstrous crime of the American imperialists further proves that they are wholeheartedly hostile to the people and hostile to peace, and that they have no sincerity whatsoever in the armistice negotiations. Since they are willing to regard themselves as poisonous bacteria, we cannot but recognize them, be vigilant against them, and deal with them in this way. The most effective way is for all of our people to do their best to carry out the sacred task of exterminating bacteria, and to achieve a final and complete victory in the current patriotic anti-corruption and anti-theft movement.

    严惩美国细菌战犯
    中国民主促进会宣传部长  董秋斯
    美国帝国主义者侵略朝鲜，碰了一个头破血流，原子敲诈也被揭穿了，所谓“海空优势”更是违反事实的空谈，这只纸老虎在全世界人民面前可以说是原形毕露了。帝国主义者原是国际的流氓，流氓是永远不会服输的。它的手段只能越来越卑劣，终于灭绝了人性，甚至连兽性也够不上，简直变成了有毒的细菌。对付细菌的办法，只有加以扑灭。
    使用细菌武器，原是国际公法、公约所不许的。这一条规定是完全合于正义的，因而是全世界人民共同支持的。谁违反了这一条规定，谁就必然成为全世界人民的敌人。因为这个原故，过去穷凶极恶的法西斯主义者，都不敢明目张胆地使用这一个武器。现在美国帝国主义者不但在朝鲜前线使用它，也在朝鲜后方和平居民中使用它，而且把使用的范围一直扩展到我国边界以内。范围是这样的大，证据是这样的多，尽管美国帝国主义者善于造谣抵赖，如何抵赖得了呢？
    美国帝国主义者使用细菌武器，已经是证据确凿，铁案如山，今后的问题是怎样处理它的问题了。处理的问题也很简单，把细菌使用者连同细菌一同扑灭就是了。正如我们有充分的力量扑灭敌人撒布的细菌，我们也有充分的力量扑灭细菌的使用者，因为正义在我们这一边，全世界有正义感的人民都在我们这一边。
    美国帝国主义者这一滔天罪行，进一步证明它一心仇视人民，仇视和平，它对停战谈判没有丝毫的诚意。它既甘心以有毒的细菌自居，我们也就不能不这样来认识它，警戒它，对付它。最有实效的办法是，我们全体人民各尽所能，执行扑灭细菌的神圣任务，更要在目前爱国主义的反贪污、反盗窃运动中取得最后的彻底的胜利。
