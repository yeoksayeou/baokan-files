Correct the Tendency of Rural Theaters to Stage Grand Operas

According to reports from our readers and local newspapers, many rural theaters are currently deviating from their important tasks of serving production, educating farmers, and raising farmers’ political consciousness. They are solely focused on form, blindly imitating certain professional theaters, and indulging in staging grand operas and pursuing large-scale scenes. They waste a lot of money on purchasing costumes and sets, increasing the burden on the masses, and creating a serious deviation.

Some rural theater members see performing as a way to "show off" personally, believing that performing short plays that are relevant to reality is "not exciting" and "not worth performing." Therefore, they compete to perform grand operas and historical dramas, such as "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl," "Nine Garments," "Li Chuang Wang," and "Lord Xinling." Some theaters, in order to perform grand operas but lacking enough manpower, fragmentarily perform only a few scenes from the grand opera to "satisfy their cravings," such as the Huangwei Theater in Siyang County, Northern Jiangsu, which performed "The White-Haired Girl" up to Yang Bailao's suicide and then ended the play the year before last, and last year they performed up to Xi'er's rape and then ended the play, giving the masses a very bad impression.

The result of rural theaters blindly staging grand operas is inevitably that the theaters become detached from the masses. Many actors speak in "Beijing accents" on stage instead of the local dialect. They also believe that performing in their own villages is "just self-entertainment" and very embarrassing, and that it is only glorious to perform in the district or county. Some cadres leading the theaters also believe that leading the theaters out of the village to perform grand operas is "very glorious," "more impressive than leading a division of soldiers." Some theaters in Yixing, Southern Jiangsu, were still performing everywhere last year when the early rice was mostly about to be harvested. Wherever the theater went, they demanded this and that, and also required good food, but the masses did not like the performances at all.

The result of rural theaters blindly staging grand operas will inevitably lead to extravagance and waste. For example, the Keqiao Town Theater in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, spent more than one million yuan on just setting up a set for "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl." A certain theater in Jiangdu, Northern Jiangsu, sold tickets for 1.2 million yuan for a charity performance, but spent 1.4 million yuan on twelve hard sets and other expenses. The Yangxiang District Theater in Yixing, Southern Jiangsu, did not focus on local opera, but specially hired a teacher to teach Peking Opera, with a monthly salary of two *shi* of rice. In addition to the head and deputy head of the theater, the Duguangbu Theater in Xiaogan, Hubei, also imitated some large theaters by setting up eight groups, including writing and painting, drama, music, storage, borrowing, arrangement, lighting, and makeup. The silk string band and *yangge* band in Zhushan Village, Zanhuang, Hebei, competed with each other in extravagance. The *yangge* band spent 1.2 million yuan to buy a stage curtain, and the silk string band spent even more money to buy a better stage curtain in Tianjin. The Ziyun Township Theater in Jingtang District, Yixing, Southern Jiangsu, was short of robes and gowns for performing, so it sent militiamen to a temple in Pingli Township, Xushe District, to rob the robes worn by the Bodhisattvas at night, which caused disputes. In order to compete in extravagance and buy stage properties, many rural theaters in Xiaogan, Hubei, Ningling, Henan, Wu'an, Hebei, Jiexiu, Shanxi, and other places even infringed on the interests of poor peasants and farm laborers, selling the fruits of victory of land reform, such as land and houses.

Rural theaters are a huge propaganda force in the countryside that cannot be ignored. According to the lowest estimates, there are currently more than 60,000 rural theaters nationwide, with nearly two million members. The leading departments in various regions must attach importance to the leadership of this propaganda force, must quickly correct the above-mentioned serious deviations, and strengthen the political and ideological education of rural theaters, so that they do not violate the principles of amateurism, voluntarism, and seasonality, closely combine with production and politics, and become a powerful tool for educating farmers.

### 纠正农村剧团演大戏的偏向

    纠正农村剧团演大戏的偏向
    据本报读者和各地报刊反映，目前有许多农村剧团离开了它服务于生产和教育农民、提高农民政治觉悟的重要任务，一味讲究形式，盲目向某些专业剧团看齐，醉心于演大戏，追求大场面，浪费许多钱购置服装布景，加重了群众的负担，产生了严重的偏向。
    有些农村剧团团员把演剧看成是为个人“出风头”，认为演出结合实际的短剧“不过瘾”“不值得演”，于是竞演大戏，演古装戏，如演“牛郎织女”“九件衣”“李闯王”“信陵公子”等。有的剧团为了要演大戏，但人手又不够，便支离破碎地演出大戏中的某几场来“过瘾”，如苏北泗阳县黄圩剧团前年演“白毛女”，演到杨白劳自杀就结束，去年演到喜儿被强奸就结束了，给了群众以很坏的影响。
    农村剧团盲目演大戏的结果必然是使剧团脱离群众。许多演员上台不说本地话，要说“京腔”。还认为在本村演戏，“自唱自乐”丑得很，要到区里县里去演才光荣。某些领导剧团的干部也认为带领剧团离开本村出外演大戏，“很有光彩”，“比带一师人马还威风”。苏南宜兴某些剧团去年在早稻大部分快要收割时，还四出演戏。剧团每到一处，要这要那，还要好饭招待，而演出的戏群众很不爱看。
    农村剧团盲目演大戏的结果必然会造成铺张浪费现象。如浙江绍兴柯桥镇剧团演“牛郎织女”，单装置一套布景就花了一百多万元。苏北江都某剧团义演，卖票一百二十万元，作十二片硬布景等的用费就用了一百四十万元。苏南宜兴杨巷区剧团不注重地方戏，特地请一个教师教京剧，每月月薪两石米。湖北孝感陡岗埠剧团除正副团长外，还仿效某些大剧团设立了写绘、戏剧、音乐、保管、借物、布置、灯光、化装等八个组。河北赞皇朱山村的丝弦班和秧歌班互比排场，秧歌班花了一百二十万元买了一个戏帐子，丝弦班就花更多的钱到天津去买更好的戏帐子。苏南宜兴鲸塘区紫云乡剧团因演戏缺少袍套，便在晚上派民兵到徐舍区洴浰乡庙里去抢菩萨穿的袍子，以致引起纠纷。为了比排场、买行头，湖北孝感、河南宁陵、河北武安、山西介休等地的许多农村剧团竟然侵犯贫农和雇农的利益，折卖了土地改革的胜利果实，如土地、房屋等。
    农村剧团是农村中的一支不可忽视的巨大的宣传队伍，根据最低估计，目前全国农村剧团在六万个以上，团员近二百万人。各地领导部门必须重视对这支宣传队伍的领导，必须迅速纠正上述的严重偏向，加强对农村剧团的政治思想教育，使它不违背业余的、自愿的和季节性的原则，密切结合生产，结合政治，成为教育农民的有力工具。
