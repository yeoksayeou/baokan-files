    Resolutely Crush the Bacteriological Warfare Endangering Humanity
    Tang Yongtong, Vice President of Peking University

    Since the beginning of this year, the American imperialists have encountered even heavier blows from the Chinese and Korean People's armies in their war of aggression against Korea. In a preposterous attempt to salvage their practically inevitable defeat, they have intensified their violation of international law and the treaties they signed in Korea, using airplanes to spread bacteria and firing bacteria-laden shells in a most despicable manner on the front lines. Recently, they even used 448 sorties of invading aircraft to spread large numbers of germ-carrying insects in Fushun, Xinmin, Andong, Kuandian and other places in our Northeast. This heinous crime of the American imperialists has surpassed the brutal record of the Nazis of that time! This shows that the closer the imperialists are to their demise, the more frantically they struggle, attempting to prolong their dying fate.

    Such inhuman actions thoroughly expose the savage nature of American imperialism. In the past, their sugar-coated poison of running schools and opening hospitals failed to achieve their aims of aggression. Then, they revealed their ferocious faces and resorted to armed attacks with airplanes and tanks. Now, they are even more desperately spreading bacteria. In the hands of the imperialists, science and technology not only fail to benefit mankind, but on the contrary, become tools for slaughtering humanity.

    The people of China and the world who love peace are paying serious attention to this heinous crime of American imperialism and expressing great anger. Medical and health science workers in our country have already organized epidemic prevention and inspection teams to fly to the Korean front lines to carry out their work. After receiving the news that American imperialism had further spread bacteria in the Northeast, the teachers were aroused to unparalleled hatred, enthusiastically supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's righteous and stern statement, and preparing to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. We firmly believe that the people have enough strength to guarantee the crushing of the bacteriological warfare that endangers humanity, and resolutely eliminate the invading beasts. The American imperialists' unjust war of aggression will inevitably suffer the most shameful defeat, and the Chinese and Korean people will surely achieve a glorious victory.

    坚决粉碎危害人类的细菌战
    北京大学副校长  汤用彤
    美帝国主义自今年开始以来，侵朝军事更遭遇到中朝人民军队沉重的打击。它为了谬想挽救其实际上不可避免的失败，竟变本加厉在朝鲜违反国际公法及其所签订的条约，用飞机撒布细菌，在前线极其卑鄙地发射细菌炮弹。最近并且用四百四十八架次侵朝飞机，居然在我国东北抚顺、新民、安东、宽甸等地，撒布大量传播细菌的毒虫。美帝国主义这种滔天罪行，突破了当年纳粹的凶残纪录！说明了帝国主义者愈到灭亡的边缘愈要作疯狂的挣扎，妄图延长其垂死的命运。
    这样丧失人性的举动，彻底暴露了美帝国主义凶残的本质，它在以前用办学校开医院等糖衣毒药不能达到侵略的目的，继则露出狰狞的面目改用飞机坦克作武装的进攻，现在更是穷凶极恶地撒布细菌。科学技术在帝国主义者的手中，不但不能为人类谋取福利，恰恰相反变成了残杀人类的工具。
    我国和世界爱好和平的人民，对于美帝国主义这一罪大恶极的暴行，正在严重的注意，表示极大的愤怒。我国医药卫生科学界人士，已经组织防疫检验队飞往朝鲜前线进行工作。教师们在得到美帝国主义进一步在东北撒布细菌的消息后，激起了无比的仇恨，热烈拥护周外长义正辞严的声明，准备随时响应祖国的号召。我们坚决相信，人民有足够的力量，保证粉碎危害人类的细菌战，坚决消灭侵略的野兽。美帝国主义违反正义的侵略战争必将遭到最可耻的失败，中朝人民必然取得光荣的胜利。
