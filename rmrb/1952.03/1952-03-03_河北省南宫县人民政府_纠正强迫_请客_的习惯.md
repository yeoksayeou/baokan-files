Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    The People's Government of Nangong County, Hebei Province
    Corrects the Habit of Compulsory "Treats"
    To the Editor: On February 4th, the People's Daily published a letter from reader Liu Zeting, criticizing our bad habit of forcing people to give treats. We believe that Comrade Liu's criticism is correct, and we accept it humbly. From the perspective of the entire organization of the People's Government of Nangong County, the practice of giving treats has formed a very bad trend. This not only wastes countless state resources, but also seriously affects the prestige of the Party and the People's Government among the masses. Therefore, after seeing Comrade Liu's criticism, in addition to immediately convening a meeting with the personnel responsible for reception at that time, the county's leading comrades also took the lead in conducting an examination of this issue.
    Currently, the cadres of our county-level organs are carrying out the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In addition to further examining the influence of bourgeois ideology on us, we are also formulating a system for the organs to eliminate this bad habit.
    The People's Government of Nangong County, Hebei Province

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    河北省南宫县人民政府
    纠正强迫“请客”的习惯
    编辑同志：二月四日，人民日报发表了读者刘泽庭同志的来信，批评我们强迫人家请客的坏习惯。我们认为刘同志这一批评是正确的，我们虚心地接受。从河北省南宫县人民政府整个机关来说，请客已形成了一种很坏的风气，这不但浪费了国家无数的资财，而且严重地影响了党和人民政府在群众中的威信。因此，我们看到刘同志这一批评后，除立刻召集当时负责接待的人员进行谈话外，县的领导同志并带头进行了对这一问题的检查。
    目前我们县级机关的干部，正在进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，我们除进一步检查资产阶级思想对我们的影响外，并制订机关肃清这种坏习惯的制度。
    河北省南宫县人民政府
