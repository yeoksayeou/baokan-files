Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 17th: Chinese writer Ding Ling, who is visiting Moscow to attend the centennial commemoration of the death of the great Russian writer Gogol, recently gave the following speech to our agency's reporter regarding her novel "The Sun Shines Over the Sangkan River" winning the Stalin Prize:

I am a very insignificant person, having done only a very, very small amount of work, and have never dared to have any illusions. I love Stalin, and I love Mao Zedong. When I am working, I often think of them, as if they were standing in front of me. In this way, I try my best to work according to their thoughts, what they like and what they hate, for fear of doing the work badly. But I never dared to dream that Stalin's name and Mao Zedong's name could be linked with my two words, Ding Ling. And today, I have the honor of receiving the second prize of the Stalin Prize in Literature. This glory unexpectedly fell upon my head. This unexpected glory shocked me greatly. I am happy, but also mixed with great unease: I cannot describe my complex mood now. I want to repeat this sentence: I am a very insignificant person, and have done only a very, very small amount of work. But I have received countless and incalculable rewards and encouragement from the people. What moves me especially is the encouragement and help from the Soviet people. After my book was translated and published in the Soviet Union, 500,000 popular editions were printed, and I received continuous encouragement from all sides. Now, I am even honored to have the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union announce the awarding of the Stalin Prize. This glory belongs to all Chinese writers, and to the Chinese people. This is an encouragement to all Chinese people and writers. All glory to the Chinese people, to the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong. I sincerely thank the Soviet people and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union for giving me this great honor and encouragement. I must work harder, do my best for the construction of the Chinese people and for world peace, and improve work efficiency, so as to be worthy of winning the Stalin Prize and worthy of the education given to me by Chairman Mao Zedong.

    丁玲就荣获斯大林奖金发表谈话
    感谢苏联人民对中国作家和人民的鼓励和帮助
    【新华社莫斯科十七日电】为参加俄罗斯伟大作家果戈理逝世一百周年纪念仪式来莫斯科访问的我国作家丁玲，顷就他的小说“桑乾河上”荣获斯大林奖金事，对本社记者发表谈话如下：
    我是一个很渺小的人，只做了很少很少的一点工作，从来不敢有什么幻想。我爱斯大林，我爱毛泽东。当我工作的时候，我心里常常想到他们，好像他们站在我的面前一样。这样，我就尽力按照他们的思想，他们所喜欢、所憎恶的意思去工作，就怕把工作作坏。但是，我从来连做梦也不敢想到斯大林的名字、毛泽东的名字能和我丁玲这两个字连在一起。而今天，我光荣地获得了文学方面的斯大林奖金二等奖。这个光荣是多么想不到地落在我的头上。这个意外的光荣是多么震动了我。我欢喜，却又夹杂着巨大的不安：我无法形容现在的复杂心情。我要重复这句话：我是一个很渺小的人，只做了很少很少的一点工作。可是我却得到了无数次和无法计算的从人民那里来的报酬和鼓励。尤其使我感动的，是苏联人民对于我的鼓励和帮助。我的书在苏联被译出后，印了五十万普及本，陆续得到各方面来的鼓励，现在更承苏联部长会议宣布授予斯大林奖金。这个光荣是中国所有作家的，是中国人民的。这是对全体中国人民和作家的鼓励。一切光荣归于中国人民，归于中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东。我衷心感激苏联人民、苏联部长会议给我这个极大的荣誉和鼓励。我一定要更加努力，为中国人民的建设、为世界和平尽所有的力量，并提高工作效率，以无愧于斯大林奖金的获得，无愧于毛泽东主席给我的教育。
