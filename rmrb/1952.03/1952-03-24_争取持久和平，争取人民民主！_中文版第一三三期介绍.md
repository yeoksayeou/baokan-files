The 133rd issue of the Chinese edition of the Cominform's organ, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", was published on the 22nd.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Resolutely and Tirelessly Expose the Warmongers," and includes the following important articles: "The Fourth Anniversary of the Victory of the February Revolution in Czechoslovakia" by Josef Čepička, Political Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; "The Struggle Against the Right-Wing Socialists and for the Unity of the Italian Working Class" by Colombo, Member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party; "The Great Struggle of the French Communist Party for National Independence, for Freedom and Peace," a report given by French Communist Party Secretary Marty at the Party Central Committee meeting in February of this year; "The Polish People Support the Cause of Peace with the Greatest Determination" by Dembowski, Chairman of the Polish National Committee for the Defense of Peace; "‘Free People’ Daily Fights for Peace and the Construction of Socialism" by Betlen, Editor-in-Chief of the Hungarian "Free People" newspaper, and others.

The editorial in this issue states: The rulers of capitalist countries are accelerating their sinister preparations for a new war. The American imperialists are forcing the governments of Western European countries to establish the so-called "European Army," while Hitler's "Wehrmacht" is being rebuilt. The American rulers are wantonly demanding that the governments of Marshallized countries further depress the living standards of the working people to increase war budgets, demanding that they suppress democratic forces, abandon national sovereignty, and accelerate the supply of cannon fodder. However, events of the past few months show that the masses of people in capitalist countries are launching an increasingly tenacious resistance movement against this imperialist policy. They firmly demand that their governments abandon the policy of war and demand the establishment of governments of peace. In capitalist countries, in dependent and colonial countries, more and more prominent figures and people with different political, religious, and other views have begun to see that the "Atlantic" decision-makers are trying to throw all mankind into the abyss, and they are increasingly condemning the policy of preparing for war and urging the establishment of normal political and economic relations between countries. The editorial emphasizes that: However, the imperialists are still constantly spreading rumors and slanders to cover up their aggressive plans, and are trying to deceive the people with a web of lies. The great task of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to resolutely and tirelessly expose the advocates of a new war, to help the masses of people unite more closely, and to fight resolutely to maintain and consolidate peace!

Čepička said in his article: It has been four years since the working people of Czechoslovakia thwarted the conspiracy of domestic and foreign reactionaries to overthrow the people's democratic system through a counter-revolutionary coup. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has continuously consolidated the unity between the working class and the peasants, and consolidated the unity of its own ranks, thereby paving the way for the establishment of socialism. The situation in the past four years clearly shows that the victory of the February Revolution won by the working people of Czechoslovakia is of great significance. Under the conditions created by the victory of the February Revolution, the Czechoslovak people not only abolished capitalism in industry, transportation, and other economic sectors, but are also confidently engaged in socialist construction, achieving great development in industry, agriculture, and culture. Čepička pointed out: However, the Western imperialists saw these situations and were filled with anger and hatred. This emotion has been manifested in open hostile activities against the Czechoslovak people; the American and British imperialists are remilitarizing West Germany. However, the Czechoslovak people will never allow the perpetrators of the 1938 Munich incident to carry out their sinister activities again. Under the banner of the victory of the February Revolution, they are exposing the masks of imperialist criminals, defeating the reactionaries, and moving with more courageous steps towards the victory of peace and socialism.

Colombo pointed out in his article that the Italian right-wing socialists held a congress in Bologna in early January of this year. After the meeting, the party changed its signboard again, renaming itself the "Italian Social Democratic Party." Nevertheless, the right-wing Socialist Party is still a party of the United States. The various groups within the party either belong to various American and British intelligence agencies, or belong to Italian capitalist groups or to the Church. It has lost its important position in leading the working-class movement and is the main enemy within the working class. When discussing the unity of the Italian working class, Colombo said: There is a deep contradiction between the demands of the rank and file members of the right-wing Socialist Party and the policies of the rebellious leaders, and this contradiction is becoming increasingly apparent. Many Social Democratic workers have gradually realized that the struggle to establish a government of peace under the banner of unity and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Socialists is a common cause of all the people. The Communist Party organization in every enterprise must support the desire for unity of the general members of the Social Democratic Party and strive for them to join the struggle to demand increased wages and fundamental economic reforms. Finally, the working class must also use persistent and flexible struggles to overcome the ideological and political bourgeois influence that has infiltrated through the right-wing socialists.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三三期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一三三期已在二十二日出版。
    本期发表了题为“坚决地和不倦地揭露战争贩子”的社论，并刊载了下列重要的文章：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治书记处书记查佩茨基的“捷克斯洛伐克二月革命胜利四周年纪念”，意大利共产党中央委员科隆比的“反对右翼社会党、争取意大利工人阶级团结的斗争”，法国共产党书记马尔梯今年二月间在党中央委员会会议上所作的题为“法国共产党为争取民族的独立、为争取自由与和平而进行伟大的斗争”，波兰保卫和平全国委员会主席德姆鲍夫斯基的“波兰人民以最大的决心支持和平事业”，匈牙利“自由人民”报总编辑贝特伦的“‘自由人民’报为和平与建设社会主义而斗争”等。
    本期的社论说：资本主义国家的统治者正在加速进行罪恶的准备新战争的工作。美帝国主义者正在强迫西欧各国政府成立所谓“欧洲军”，同时希特勒“国防军”正在重新建立起来。美国统治者蛮横地要求马歇尔化各国的政府进一步压低劳动人民的生活水准以增加战争预算，要求它们镇压民主力量，放弃国家主权和加速供应炮灰。但是，过去几个月的事件表明：资本主义国家的人民群众正在展开一个越来越顽强的抵抗运动，反对这个帝国主义的政策。他们坚决主张他们的政府放弃战争政策，并要求成立和平的政府。在资本主义国家中，在附属国和殖民地国家中，愈来愈多的知名人士和政治、宗教及其他观点不相同的人们，已开始看出“大西洋”决策者企图把全人类投进万丈深渊，他们日甚一日地斥责准备战争的政策，并力促建立各国间的正常的政治经济关系。社论强调指出：但是，帝国主义者仍在不断散播谣言和诽谤，来掩盖他们的侵略计划，竭力以谎言的罗网来欺骗人民。共产党和工人党的伟大任务，就是坚决地和不倦地揭露新战争的鼓吹者，帮助人民群众更紧密地团结起来，为维护和巩固和平而坚决斗争！
    查佩茨基在文章中说：自从捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民挫败国内外反动派企图以反革命政变推翻人民民主制度的阴谋以来，已经有四年了。捷克斯洛伐克共产党不断地巩固工人阶级和农民之间的团结，巩固自己队伍的团结，从而为建立社会主义铺平道路。过去四年来的局势清楚地说明了捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民赢得的二月革命的胜利，是具有极大意义的。在二月革命的胜利所创造的条件下，捷克斯洛伐克人民不仅把工业、运输业和其他经济部门的资本主义废除了，而且正满怀信心地从事社会主义建设，使工业、农业和文化方面都获得了很大的发展。查佩茨基指出：但是，西方帝国主义者看到了这些情形，就充满了愤怒和仇恨的情绪。这种情绪已在对捷克斯洛伐克人民的公开敌对活动中表现出来；美英帝国主义者正在使西德重新军国主义化。但是，捷克斯洛伐克人民绝不会让一九三八年慕尼黑事件的制造者重新进行罪恶的活动。他们正在二月革命的胜利的旗帜下，揭露帝国主义罪犯的假面具，击败反动分子，并以更勇敢的步伐，走向和平与社会主义的胜利。
    科隆比在文章中指出，今年一月初，意大利右翼社会党人在波伦亚举行了代表大会。会后该党再一次改换了招牌，改称“意大利社会民主党”。虽然如此，右翼社会党依然是美国的政党。党内的各个集团不是属于美、英的各种谍报机关，就是属于意大利各资本家集团或者属于教会。它已丧失了在领导工人阶级运动方面的重要地位，而是工人阶级内部的主要敌人。科隆比在论到意大利工人阶级的团结时说：在右翼社会党党员群众的要求和叛逆的领袖们的政策之间，存在着深刻的矛盾，这种矛盾愈来愈表面化了。许多社会民主党工人都已逐渐认识到，在团结的旗帜下并在共产党与社会党人的领导下，争取建立一个和平政府的斗争，是全体人民的共同事业。每一个企业里的共产党组织必须支持社会民主党一般党员要求团结的愿望，争取他们加入要求增加工资和要求进行基本经济改革的斗争。最后，工人阶级也必须用坚持不懈的和灵活的斗争，来克服经由右翼社会党人侵袭进来的思想上和政治上的资产阶级影响。    （新华社）
