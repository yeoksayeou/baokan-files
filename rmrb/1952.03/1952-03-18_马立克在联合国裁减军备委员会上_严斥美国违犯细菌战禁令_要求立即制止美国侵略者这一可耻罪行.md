(Xinhua News Agency, March 17th) According to a TASS dispatch from New York on March 15th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission, established in accordance with the resolution of the Sixth United Nations General Assembly on January 11, 1952, held its second meeting on the 14th. Soviet representative Malik severely condemned the United States at the meeting for its lack of sincerity in disarmament and banning the use of atomic weapons, and demanded a discussion of the issue of the United States' use of bacteriological weapons in Korea.

The American representative presented the committee's "work plan" at the meeting. This plan tried every possible means to avoid touching on the issue of disarmament and armed forces, and did not mention a word about the necessity of banning atomic weapons and establishing strict international control over such a ban.

After exposing the ulterior motives of the "work plan" presented by the American representative, Soviet representative Malik raised two questions to the American representative.

When raising the first question, Malik said that U.S. Secretary of State Acheson had made slanderous remarks against the Soviet Union on March 12th, attempting to prove that the existing threats all came from the Soviet Union and the Soviet armed forces. Malik said that the whole world knows that this is a lie and a slander against the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union has always pursued a peaceful policy and cooperated peacefully with all nations and countries that are committed to peace and friendship among nations. Malik pointed out that Acheson's nonsense was nothing new, but it is worth noting because it was published before the Disarmament Commission began its work. Malik refuted Acheson's excuse, saying that the arms race was necessary because the Soviet Union supposedly had a large number of troops, with concrete facts. Malik pointed out that it is the United States that has a large armed force. According to incomplete statistics, the United States now has 3.5 million armed forces, plus 2 million various reserve forces and National Guard. The armed forces of the United States, Britain, and France in 1939 exceeded the Soviet Union's armed forces by more than two times. And the United States' current military strength has reached 10.4 times its strength in 1939. The armed forces of the Atlantic aggressive bloc headed by the United States, plus Yugoslavia and Spain, which are closely attached to the United States, have now reached more than 7 million, according to extremely incomplete figures recently announced by the "New York Herald Tribune," in addition to the United States' 2 million various reserve forces and National Guard. Malik pointed out: Acheson talks about disarmament but actually demands further strengthening of military strength. Malik asked: Since Acheson wants to prove that the arms race and the huge growth of American armaments are because the Soviet Union supposedly has a large number of troops, and the Soviet Union proposes to immediately adopt a decision to reduce the armaments of the five major powers and ban weapons of mass human slaughter, then why not start the work of the Disarmament Commission by adopting the extremely important decision to disarm, first of all to disarm the five major powers?

The American representative refused to answer this question.

Malik said that, in this way, the American representative also refused to answer the second question of the Soviet delegation. That is, what is the United States' attitude towards the immediate adoption by the five major powers of a decision to reduce armed forces and armaments and to ban weapons of mass human slaughter, and towards the United Nations Disarmament Commission beginning its work and discussing this issue? Neither in the plan presented by the American representative nor in his speech about this plan was this mentioned at all.

Then Malik said: Now I will talk about the third question. I hope the committee will pay attention to the following situation. World public opinion is currently paying close attention to the issue of the use of bacteriological weapons by the American army in Korea and China. This matter has aroused reasonable indignation among all honest people in the world. With great importance attached to this issue, I raise the following questions to the American representative and the committee: "Since the Disarmament Commission cannot avoid asking about the most practical issues in the arms area, then it cannot ignore some recent events such as the use of bacteriological weapons by the American army in Korea and China to massacre civilians on a large scale. Shouldn't the Disarmament Commission therefore immediately consider the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare—a very shameful war incompatible with the conscience of honest people and the conscience of civilized people—so that bacteriological weapons may not be used in the future, and those who violate the ban on bacteriological warfare may be brought to justice?"

The American representative, while admitting that the issue of banning bacteriological warfare is within the jurisdiction of the committee, tried to deny the use of bacteriological weapons by the American army in Korea, and also cited Acheson's statement on this issue. Regarding the American representative's remarks, Malik said: It is precisely because the Disarmament Commission has the right to consider the issue of bacteriological warfare that the Soviet delegation raises this question: Shouldn't the Disarmament Commission therefore immediately consider the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare—a very shameful war?

The chairman of the committee, Canadian representative Johnson, fearing that the discussion would be even more unfavorable to the American delegation, announced a recess.

    马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会上
    严斥美国违犯细菌战禁令
    要求立即制止美国侵略者这一可耻罪行
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约十五日讯：遵照第六届联合国大会一九五二年一月十一日的决议成立的联合国裁减军备委员会，在十四日举行第二次会议。苏联代表马立克在会上严厉指责美国对裁减军备、禁止使用原子武器缺乏诚意，并要求讨论美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器的问题。
    美国代表在会上提出了委员会的“工作计划”。这个计划想尽办法避免触及裁减军备和武装部队的问题，并且一字不提禁止原子武器和对这种禁止建立严格国际管制的必要性。
    苏联代表马立克在揭穿了美国代表所提出的“工作计划”别有用心以后，向美国代表提出了两个问题。
    马立克在提出第一个问题时说，美国国务卿艾奇逊曾经在三月十二日发表污蔑苏联的谈话，企图证明现存的威胁都是来自苏联和苏联的武装部队。马立克说，全世界都知道这是谎话和对苏联的污蔑。因为苏联一向奉行和平政策，并和一切致力于和平与各民族间友好的民族与国家和平合作。马立克指出，艾奇逊的谰言本来已经不是什么新的东西，可是因为它发表在裁减军备委员会开始工作之前，这就值得注意了。马立克用具体事实有力地驳斥了艾奇逊的藉口，说什么因为苏联有大量军队，所以有必要进行军备竞赛。马立克指出，有庞大的武装部队的正是美国。据不完全统计，美国现在有三百五十万武装部队，还有二百万人的各种后备部队和国民警卫队。美、英、法三国的武装部队，在一九三九年就比苏联的武装部队超过二倍以上。而美国现在的兵力，已经达到它在一九三九年时的兵力的十点四倍。而以美国为首的大西洋侵略集团的武装部队，加上紧紧依附美国的南斯拉夫和西班牙，据不久前“纽约先驱论坛报”宣布的极不完全的数字，现在已达七百多万人，此外还有美国的二百万人的各种后备部队和国民警卫队。马立克指出：艾奇逊嘴里说要裁减军备，实际上却要求进一步增强军事力量。马立克问道：既然艾奇逊想证明军备竞赛和美国军备的巨大增长，是因为苏联彷佛有了大量的军队的缘故，而苏联却建议马上采取裁减五大国军备和禁止大规模屠杀人类的武器的决定，那么为什么不从采取极为重要的裁减军备、首先是裁减五大国军备的决定来开始裁减军备委员会的工作呢？
    美国代表拒绝回答这个问题。
    马立克说，这样，美国代表也就拒绝回答苏联代表团的第二个问题。这就是要问，对于五大国立即采取裁减武装部队和军备、禁止大规模屠杀人类的武器的决定，对于联合国裁减军备委员会开始工作并讨论这个问题，美国的态度如何？无论在美国代表所提出的计划里，无论在他有关这个计划的发言里，对这一点都一句话也没有涉及。
    接着马立克说：现在我来谈第三个问题。我希望委员会注意下面这种情况。全世界的舆论目前都十分注意美国军队在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的问题。这件事引起了全世界一切正直人们合理的愤慨。我以非常重视这个问题的心情向美国代表和委员会提出下列问题：“既然裁减军备委员会不能避而不问军备方面最实际的问题，那么对于像美国军队在朝鲜和中国使用大批屠杀平民的细菌武器这样一些最近发生的事情，它也就不能置之不理。难道裁减军备委员会不应该因此立即考虑关于违犯细菌战——与正直人的良心、文明人民的良心不相容的十分可耻的战争——禁令的问题，使今后不得使用细菌武器，并使违犯细菌战禁令者受到审判吗？”
    美国代表一方面承认禁止细菌战的问题属于委员会的权限之内，另一方面却试图否认美国军队在朝鲜使用细菌武器，而且还引证艾奇逊关于这一问题的声明。关于美国代表的这种言论，马立克说：正是因为裁减军备委员会有权考虑细菌战的问题，苏联代表团提出这个问题：难道裁减军备委员会不应该因此立即考虑关于违犯细菌战——十分可耻的战争——禁令的问题吗？
    委员会主席、加拿大代表江逊，因为害怕讨论将对美国代表团更加不利，就宣布休会。
