Xinhua News Agency, March 13th—Mr. Li Xijiu, a member of the Central People's Government Committee, a member of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the Central People's Government, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, and a Central Committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, passed away due to esophageal cancer at Peking Union Medical College Hospital on March 10, 1952, and was encoffined on the 11th. The funeral committee for Mr. Li Xijiu held a memorial service yesterday afternoon. Those who attended the encoffining ceremony and memorial service included Li Jishen, Zhou Enlai, Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, Luo Ronghuan, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Tan Pingshan, Li Weihan, Zhang Xiruo, Peng Zemin, Ma Yinchu, Wu Yuzhang, Xu Teli, Liu Geping, Situ Meitang, Cai Tingkai, Fu Zuoyi, Zhang Bojun, Liu Yazi, Jiang Guangnai, Liu Lantao, Yang Xiufeng, Deng Yingchao, Wang Kunlun, Chen Shaoxian, Shao Lizi, Xie Juezai, Wang Shao'ao, Zhu Xuefan, Li Shucheng, Chen Qiyuan, Wang Baozhen, Xing Xiping, Zhang Youyu, Qi Yanming, Yu Xinqing, Liu Gufeng, Liu Qingyang, as well as Mr. Li Xijiu's family and friends.

At Mr. Li Xijiu's memorial service, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government and Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Li Jishen, and Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, Yang Xiufeng, both delivered speeches. Vice Chairman Li Jishen, after recounting Mr. Li Xijiu's deeds over the decades in opposing the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, Japanese imperialism, and American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, said: Eighty years of Chinese history have been a tortuous and winding path, but at several historical turning points, Mr. Xijiu always moved in the direction of progress. For decades, he adhered to one principle: anything that was beneficial to the Communist Party, he would take the lead in doing because it was beneficial to the people; anything that was harmful to the Communist Party, he would resolutely not do because it was harmful to the people. This kind of integrity, strong in old age, is worthy of our emulation.

Chairman Yang Xiufeng, in his speech, said that what moved him most deeply and what he would miss most about Mr. Li Xijiu's thought and style was the old gentleman's loyalty in uniting and cooperating with the Communist Party, his resolute support and implementation of the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, his loyal service to the people, his sincere support for Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation, as well as his simple life and amiable and approachable manner. Chairman Yang Xiufeng concluded by saying that we will definitely implement Mr. Xijiu's noble patriotic spirit, internationalist spirit, concern for the people's lives, and honest and simple style into the entire cadre and all work of Hebei Province.

Mr. Li Xijiu's memorial service ended after a response from Li Zize, the representative of the family.

Mr. Li Xijiu was a native of Anping County, Hebei Province, and was 80 years old. He was an old member of the Tongmenghui and always supported Dr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants. In September 1949, he was elected as a representative to the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and at the meeting, he was elected as a member of the Central People's Government.

    李济深副主席、周恩来总理等参加入殓仪式
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府委员、中央人民政府最高人民检察署委员、河北省人民政府副主席、中国国民党革命委员会中央委员李锡九先生患食道癌于一九五二年三月十日在北京协和医院病故，十一日入殓。李锡九先生治丧委员会特于十三日下午举行追悼会。参加入殓仪式和追悼会的，有李济深、周恩来、沈钧儒、陈叔通、罗荣桓、郭沫若、黄炎培、谭平山、李维汉、张奚若、彭泽民、马寅初、吴玉章、徐特立、刘格平、司徒美堂、蔡廷锴、傅作义、章伯钧、柳亚子、蒋光鼐、刘澜涛、杨秀峰、邓颖超、王昆仑、陈劭先、邵力子、谢觉哉、王绍鏊、朱学范、李书城、陈其瑗、王葆真、邢西萍、张友渔、齐燕铭、余心清、刘古风、刘清扬及李锡九先生家属亲友等。
    在李锡九先生追悼会上，中央人民政府副主席、中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深，河北省人民政府主席杨秀峰均作了讲话。李济深副主席在历举李锡九先生数十年来反对满清、反对北洋军阀、反对日本帝国主义和美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的事迹后说：八十年来的中国历史，是一段迂回曲折的历史，但是在几个历史转折点上，锡九先生总是朝着进步的方向走的。数十年来，他本着一个原则，凡是对共产党有利的，他一定抢先去做，因为那是对人民有利的；凡是对共产党有害的，他一定坚决不做，因为那是对人民有害的。这种劲骨清操，老而弥坚，是值得我们向他学习的。
    杨秀峰主席在讲话时，说到李锡九的思想和作风使他感动最深、怀念最切的，是老先生忠诚地与共产党团结合作，坚决地拥护和贯彻中国共产党和中央人民政府的政策，忠心耿耿地为人民服务，诚挚地拥护中苏友好合作，以及生活朴素，作风和霭近人。杨秀峰主席最后说，我们决将锡九先生崇高的爱国精神、国际主义精神，时刻关心人民生活的思想和廉洁朴素的作风，贯彻到河北省的全体干部与各项工作中去。
    李锡九先生追悼会在家属代表李子泽致答词后结束。
    李锡九先生为河北省安平县人，享年八十，老同盟会会员，始终是孙中山先生联俄、联共、扶助工农三大政策的拥护者。一九四九年九月，被举为中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议代表，在会议上，被选举为中央人民政府委员。
