    Broad Masses of Women, Stand on the Front Lines of the Anti-Corruption Struggle

    The "March 8th" International Women's Day is coming. I hope that my dear sisters will all stand on the front lines of the anti-corruption struggle.

    I used to be a poor child. The life of a "child bride" painfully consumed my precious childhood. After the liberation of Hunan, I joined the revolutionary work. In the past three years, under the education of Chairman Mao, I joined the Youth League, and I became a daughter of the Communist Party. I worked actively. I competed with my comrades in work. I strive to make my youth more beautiful.

    Today, commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day, is precisely the time when the nationwide anti-corruption and anti-theft movement is deepening. We can think of our responsibilities as significant. I want to stand at the forefront of the struggle, mobilize others, help others, and capture the major corrupt elements. I want to learn from the volunteer army heroines in Korea.

### 广大妇女站到反贪污斗争的阵地上来

    广大妇女站到反贪污斗争的阵地上来
    “三八”节到来了。我希望亲爱的姊妹们都站到反贪污斗争的阵地上来。
    我从前是一个穷孩子。“童养媳”的生活，痛苦地消磨了我宝贵的幼年。湖南解放，我参加了革命工作。三年来，在毛主席的教养下，我入了青年团，我成了共产党的儿女。我积极地工作。我和同志们在工作中竞赛。我努力把我的青春过得更美丽。
    今天纪念“三八”节，正是全国深入反贪污、反盗窃运动的时候。我们可以想到，我们的责任是重大的。我要站在斗争的最前列，动员别人，帮助别人，捕捉大贪污犯。我要向在朝鲜的志愿军英雄姊妹们学习。    丁维
