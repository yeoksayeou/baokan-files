A Letter of Irresponsible "Guarantee" to the Party

    Ruan Dimin, the Director of Gansu Daily, the Director of Gansu People's Publishing House, and the Director of Gansu People's Broadcasting Station, wrote a letter to the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on February 4th, the content of which was extremely absurd, proving that his right-leaning麻痹 (ma bi) in the anti-corruption struggle had reached its peak. In this letter, he said:
     "Provincial Committee: Regarding the Gansu Daily, Gansu People's
    Publishing House, Gansu People's Broadcasting Station, and the Tibetan
    Reporters Group stationed in Gansu, which I lead, I guarantee, with an
    attitude of absolute responsibility to the Party, that there is not a
    single major embezzler with over 100 million yuan. If any major
    embezzler is found, I am willing to accept the Party's punishment."
    At the time, the Provincial Committee lightly believed the "guarantee" put forward by Ruan Dimin and did not send anyone to Gansu Daily and other units to inspect. Unexpectedly, three days later, the facts ruthlessly shattered Ruan Dimin's "guarantee," and also struck at the麻痹 (ma bi) thinking of the Provincial Committee's leadership. Ruan Dimin, who had made a guarantee to the Party three days earlier, had to admit his mistake and asked for punishment. The following is Ruan Dimin's letter to the Gansu Provincial Committee on February 8th:
     "Provincial Committee: Today, the Broadcasting Station has uncovered
    two major embezzlers: one is Wang Yutang, a technology worker in the
    Engineering Department, who stole equipment worth a total of 140 million
    yuan when Lanzhou was liberated. The other is also a technology worker
    in the Engineering Department, named Zhu Chuanqin, who stole equipment
    worth a total of 30 million yuan when Lanzhou was liberated. These are
    all things I did not anticipate. The day before yesterday, I made a
    guarantee to the Provincial Committee, saying that there were no major
    embezzlers with over 100 million yuan in the units I led. Now that the
    facts are before me, it proves that my understanding and research of the
    situation are very insufficient, and my bureaucracy has reached its
    peak. I hereby request the Provincial Committee to give me punishment."
    Shortly after Ruan Dimin requested punishment, another major embezzler named Fang Yingmao, who embezzled 140 million yuan, was discovered in the units he led.
    The facts are very clear: the "guarantee" that Ruan Dimin previously made to the Party was actually a deception and a lie against the Party. Regardless of his subjective intentions, his deception objectively shielded major embezzlers.
    What caused Ruan Dimin to do such an irresponsible thing to the Party? According to Ruan Dimin, it was because his "bureaucracy had reached its peak" and his "understanding and research of the situation were insufficient." However, people must ask: since his "understanding and research of the situation were very insufficient," why did he make a "guarantee" "with an attitude of absolute responsibility to the Party"? This is difficult to justify. In fact, Ruan Dimin simply had no concept of the enemy's presence and did not go to the front line. Therefore, he regarded the units he led as "clean departments." In this way, although he was sitting in the combat headquarters or even shouting about capturing embezzlers, he could not see the embezzlers right beside him because he did not understand the serious facts of the bourgeoisie launching an attack on the revolution. Therefore, Ruan Dimin's report requesting punishment is also extremely superficial in its understanding of his mistakes.
    The duty of a combat commander is to understand the situation, grasp the policies, and deploy the battle. However, even now, some people are still unsure whether there are embezzlers in their units, some underreport the amount, and some "guarantee" that there are no embezzlers. These all seriously demonstrate right-leaning thinking. This right-leaning thinking must be corrected as soon as possible to avoid repeating Ruan Dimin's lesson.

### 一封对党不负责任的“保证书”

    一封对党不负责任的“保证书”
    甘肃日报社社长、甘肃省人民出版社社长、甘肃省人民广播电台台长阮迪民，在二月四日给中共甘肃省委写了一封信，内容十分荒谬，证明他在反贪污斗争中麻痹右倾达于极点。他在这封信里说：
     “省委：在我领导的甘肃日报社、甘肃人民出
    版社、甘肃人民广播电台以及西藏驻甘肃记者
    组，我以对党绝对负责的态度，保证没有一个一
    亿元以上的大贪污分子。如果查出大贪污分子，
    我愿受党的处分。”
    当时，省委轻信了阮迪民所提出的“保证”，没有派人到甘肃日报社等单位去检查。不想过了三天，事实却无情地打破了阮迪民的“保证书”，同时也打击了省委领导方面的麻痹思想。三天前曾经向党提出保证的阮迪民不得不承认错误，自请处分了。下面是阮迪民二月八日给甘肃省委的信：
     “省委：今天广播电台突破了两个大贪污分
    子：一个是工务科技工王育棠，兰州解放时，他盗
    窃器材，总值达一亿四千万元。另一个也是工务
    科技工，叫朱传勤，兰州解放时，他偷窃器材，总
    值达三千万元。这都是我未估计到的。大前天，
    我向省委作了保证，说我领导的各单位没有一亿
    元以上的大贪污分子，现在事实摆在面前，证明
    我对情况的了解和研究非常不够，官僚主义到了
    顶点，特请省委给我以处分。”
    而在阮迪民请求处分以后，不久，在他领导的单位又查出了一个大贪污分子，叫做方应茂，贪污达一亿四千万。
    事实看得很清楚：以前阮迪民对党所提出的“保证”，原来是对党的欺骗和撒谎。他的这种欺骗，姑不论主观意图如何，客观上是掩护了大贪污分子。
    是什么原因使阮迪民做出这种对党不负责任的事情呢？照阮迪民说，是因为“官僚主义到了顶点”、“对情况的了解和研究不够”，可是，人们要问：既然“对情况的了解和研究非常不够”，为什么又“以对党绝对负责的态度”提出“保证”呢？这是很难说通的。事实上，阮迪民根本就没有敌情观念，根本就没有上前线，因而他把自己所领导的各单位，当作“清水衙门”，这样，他虽然坐在作战指挥部或者也在叫喊着捕捉贪污分子，却看不到贪污分子就在他的身边，因为他不了解资产阶级向革命进攻的严重事实。因此，阮迪民自请处分的报告，对他的错误的认识也是极不深刻的。
    一个战斗的指挥人员的职责是了解情况，掌握政策，部署战斗。可是，直到现在，有的人对本单位有无贪污分子还不敢肯定，有的人则以多报少，有的人则“保证”没有贪污分子。这些都严重地表现了右倾思想。这种右倾思想必须及早纠正，以免重复阮迪民的教训。
