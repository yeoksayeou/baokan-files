    Biology Department Faculty and Students of Several Beijing Universities Resolve to Contribute Biological Science Knowledge to the Forefront of Epidemic Prevention Work

    Editor: After our department's faculty and students saw the news of the American invaders launching a bacteriological war against our Northeast, we held a general meeting that evening. All the faculty and students of the department unanimously expressed their determination to first carry out the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to the end, and at the same time organize to study, preparing to respond to the solemn call of the motherland at any time and accept the glorious combat mission.
    Beijing Normal University Biology Department Faculty and Students

    Editor: When American imperialism spread bacteria in Korea, we wrote to the editor, determined to participate in bacteriological warfare defense work when the motherland needed us, in order to directly resist this shameless aggression by American imperialism. Later, we saw the news that American imperialism, disregarding the warnings of our country and the people of the world, invaded our Northeast and spread bacteria, and felt even greater anger.

    We are students of the Biology Department and have certain biological science knowledge. We ask the People's Government to assign us practical work to defend against bacteriological warfare, so that we can do our part in the struggle against American imperialism.
    Hong Duo Jia and 46 other students from the Biology Department of Tsinghua University

    Editor: We feel boundless anger at the crimes of American imperialism spreading bacteria in the Northeast. We are determined and confident to work with the people of the whole country to smash all the conspiracies of American imperialism. We have organized a small team and are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and participate in epidemic prevention publicity and other work. Wherever the motherland needs us, we will go there. We are determined to fight American imperialism to the end until it is forced to lay down its arms and accept peace.

    Editor: The crime of the American invaders launching bacteriological warfare proves that they are extremely hostile to the desire for peace of the people of the world and the interests of all mankind.

    In order to respond with practical actions to this monstrous crime against humanity committed by American imperialism, all the fourth-year students of the Biology Department of Fu Jen Catholic University resolutely demand to go to the forefront of the battle to carry out epidemic prevention work. We will thoroughly eliminate the bacteria spread by American imperialism in Korea and our Northeast, and use practical actions to strengthen the power of resisting America and aiding Korea, so as to smash all the arrogant and reckless moves of American imperialism.
    All Fourth-Year Students of the Biology Department of Fu Jen Catholic University

    北京几个大学的生物系师生
    决心贡献出生物科学知识到最前线去进行防疫工作
    编辑同志：我系全体师生看到美国侵略者向我东北发动细菌战的消息后，当天晚上就开了大会。全系师生一致表示决心，首先把目前的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进行到底，同时组织起来学习，准备随时响应祖国的庄严号召，接受光荣的战斗任务。北京师范大学生物系全体师生
    编辑同志：当美帝国主义在朝鲜撒布细菌时，我们曾经写信给编辑同志，决心在祖国需要的时候，参加细菌战防御工作，以便直接抗击美帝国主义这种无耻的侵略。后来我们看到美帝国主义不顾我国和全世界人民的警告，侵入我国东北撒布细菌的消息，感到更大的愤怒。
    我们是生物系的学生，有一定的生物科学知识。我们要求人民政府分配我们防御细菌战的实际工作，使我们在抗击美帝国主义的斗争中尽一份力量。
    清华大学生物学系学生洪多加等四十六人
    编辑同志：我们对美帝国主义在东北撒布细菌的罪行，感到无比的愤怒。我们有决心也有信心和全国人民在一起，粉碎美帝国主义的一切阴谋。我们组织了一个小队，随时准备响应祖国号召，参加防疫宣传等工作。祖国需要我们到那里，我们就到那里。我们坚决和美帝国主义斗争到底，直至迫使它放下武器接受和平为止。
    辅仁大学生物系教师刘玉素　武兆发    王玢

    戚其慧　魏开元　张启元
    编辑同志：美国侵略者发动细菌战的罪行，证明了它对全世界人民要求和平的愿望及全人类的利益是极端仇视的。
    为了用实际行动回击美帝国主义这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，我们辅仁大学生物系四年级全体同学，坚决要求到战斗最前线，进行防疫工作。我们要彻底扑灭美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北所撒布的细菌，用实际行动加强抗美援朝的力量，来粉碎美帝国主义一切狂妄的蠢动。
    辅仁大学生物系四年级全体学生
