Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 27th: The Northeast Branch of the "Investigation Group on American Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes" returned to Shenyang on the afternoon of the 26th from Fushun. Over the past two days, the investigation group collected a large amount of evidence in Fushun City regarding the germ warfare conducted by American imperialism.

On the afternoon of the 25th, the investigation group conducted an on-site investigation of the poisonous insect area near Xintun Street and the Machinery and Electrical Repair Manufacturing Plant in the Xin'an District. The density of poisonous insects distributed on Xintun Street was astonishing. On another piece of land, they personally saw many poisonous spiders. Local residents expressed extreme anger at the barbaric atrocities of American imperialist germ warfare. They guided the investigation group to survey the areas contaminated by poisonous insects and described in detail how they were discovered. Wang Shirong, a family member of a soldier, said: "After twelve American planes invaded our Fushun airspace at 7:50 a.m. on February 29th, I found many black jumping insects and flies on the snow. At that time, not a single fly was found in the warm workers' residences." Liu Hushi, a fifty-year-old family member of a worker, said: "A large number of flies, mosquitoes, and spiders were flying and jumping on the half-foot-deep snow. This has never happened before." Qi Yangshi, a sixty-year-old woman, said: "If American planes didn't scatter small black insects on our roofs, how could a large number of small black insects jump so high onto the roofs? The facts are all here today. The American devils still want to deny it. They are truly shameless." Zhao Peihua, Yu Tongzhen, Zhang Qiumei, and elementary school students Ma Jieru and Zhao Hong, and other family members of workers all accused the American planes of spreading germ-carrying poisonous insects. Wang Shiwei, a farmer in the city, found a large number of germ-carrying poisonous insects dropped by American planes on the roof of the two-story steel-concrete building at the racecourse; students at Fushun No. 1 Middle School also found poisonous insects similar to earthworms on the roof of the school building. These powerfully demonstrate that the crimes of American imperialism in conducting germ warfare cannot be denied at all.

During the two days the investigation group spent in Fushun, in addition to investigating and collecting a lot of evidence, they also went to various epidemic areas to express their condolences to the local residents. Everywhere they went, they saw the masses bravely exterminating poisonous insects with various effective methods. The workers of the Machinery and Electrical Repair Manufacturing Plant not only eliminated the vast majority of the germ-carrying poisonous insects in the plant, but also overfulfilled their production tasks in mid-March by 27.2%. On the morning of the 26th, the investigation group conducted an on-site inspection of 7th Street, Beiyaodi, in the Xinfu District, and witnessed the heroic struggle of local women on the anti-bacterial warfare front. Forty-four women from the street jointly signed an indictment to the investigation group, accusing the American aggressors of spreading germ-carrying poisonous insects. The indictment stated: "These poisonous insects in our Fushun City, according to the season, climate, morphology, and species, are unprecedented in history. The quantity we have captured and eliminated with great effort also proves that these bacterial poisonous insects were spread by American imperialism."

Xinhua News Agency, Antung, March 26th: The group of Chinese and foreign journalists investigating American imperialism's germ warfare in Northeast China arrived in Antung on the morning of March 24th and immediately rushed to Kwandien County, where germ bombs were discovered, for an on-site investigation. After arriving in Kwandien, Han Yongbin, the owner of the Tongjuhe grocery store in Nanmenli, Kwandien County, who witnessed American planes dropping germ bombs, and Li Sijian, a first-year student at Kwandien Middle School, led the group to the site for investigation and described in detail what had happened. In addition to recording the details of American planes dropping germ bombs, poisonous insects, and poisons from the air, the journalists took photos of the witnesses who saw the American planes spreading germs and the on-site physical evidence, and returned to Antung that night. On the 25th, the journalist group visited the "Exhibition Room of Evidence of American Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes" in Antung City and conducted interviews and investigations in Antung City. Chinese and foreign journalists witnessed the various crimes committed by American germ warfare criminals in violation of humanitarian principles and international law, and expressed extreme indignation. After two days of intense work, the group returned to Shenyang on the evening of the 25th.

    “美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团
    续获美国细菌战大量罪证
    中外记者团在安东宽甸记录下美国侵略者的滔天罪行
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”东北分团，二十六日下午由抚顺市回到沈阳。调查团在过去两天中，在抚顺市收集了大量的关于美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪证。
    调查团在二十五日下午，到新安区新屯街和机械电器修理制造厂附近毒虫区作了实地调查。新屯街毒虫分布的密度十分惊人。在另一片地上，他们又亲自看到许多含毒的蜘蛛。当地居民对美帝国主义细菌战的野蛮暴行，表示万分愤怒。他们引导调查团去勘察被毒虫污染的地区，并详述发现毒虫的经过。军人家属王世荣说：“美国飞机十二架在二月二十九日午前七时五十分侵入我们抚顺上空后，我就在雪地上发现了很多黑跳虫、苍蝇，当时在温暖的工人住宅中却没有发现一个苍蝇。”五十岁的工人家属刘胡氏说：“大量的苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛在半尺深的积雪上飞的飞、跳的跳，这是过去从来没有过的。”六十岁的老大娘齐杨氏说：“不是美国飞机把小黑虫撒在我们房顶上，难道大批的小黑虫都能跳那么高跳到屋顶上去吗？今天事实俱在，美国鬼子还想抵赖，真是太不要脸了。”工人家属赵佩华、于同珍、张秋梅和小学生马洁茹、赵红等都控告了美国飞机撒布细菌毒虫的罪行。该市农民王世维在跑马场的二层钢骨水泥楼顶上发现有美国飞机撒下的大量含菌毒虫；抚顺市第一中学的学生在学校楼房顶上也发现了类似蚯蚓的毒虫。这些都有力地说明了美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行是绝对抵赖不了的。
    调查团在抚顺的两天中，除调查和收集了许多罪证外，并赴各疫区慰问当地居民，每到一处，都看到群众正以多种多样的有效方法、英勇地扑灭着毒虫。机械电器修理制造厂的工人们不仅消灭了厂内绝大部分的含菌毒虫，并在三月中旬超额完成生产任务的百分之二十七点二。调查团在二十六日上午到新抚区北腰地七街进行了实地勘察，看到当地妇女在反细菌战线上英勇奋斗的情形。该街四十四名妇女当场联合签名向调查团提出了控告美国侵略者撒布含菌毒虫的控诉书。控诉书说：“这些毒虫在我们抚顺市，根据季节、气候、形态、种类，是历史上所没有的，经我们大力捕捉和消灭的数量，也证明出来这些细菌毒虫为美帝国主义所撒布。”
    【新华社安东二十六日电】调查美帝国主义在东北进行细菌战的中外记者团，在三月二十四日晨由沈阳抵安东后，当日即赶赴发现细菌弹的宽甸县进行实地调查。记者团到达宽甸后，由目击美机投下细菌弹的宽甸县城南门里同聚合杂货铺掌柜韩永斌和宽甸中学一年级学生李思俭带领该团赴现场调查，并详细介绍事件发生经过。记者团除记录了美国飞机从空中投下细菌弹、毒虫、毒物的详细经过外，并将目击美机撒布细菌的证人和现场物证拍成照片，当晚回到安东。二十五日记者团在安东市参观了“美帝国主义细菌战罪证陈列室”，并在安东市内访问和调查。中外记者目击美国细菌战犯进行违反人道、破坏国际公法的各项罪证，无不表示万分愤慨。该团经过两日的紧张工作后，已在二十五日晚返回沈阳。
