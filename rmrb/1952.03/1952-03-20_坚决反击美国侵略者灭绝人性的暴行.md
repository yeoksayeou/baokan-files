    Resolutely Counter the Inhumane Atrocities of the American Aggressors
    Qiu Zuyuan, Director-General of the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association

    The American imperialists are recklessly using bacteriological weapons on the Korean battlefield. Years ago, they painstakingly gathered and fostered a group of German and Japanese fascist bandits to research bacteriological weapons. Recently, in addition to waging a brutal bacteriological war on the Korean front, they have expanded the scope of bacteriological warfare to Northeast China and Qingdao, frantically dropping bacteriological bombs, spreading large numbers of germ-carrying insects, and carrying out indiscriminate bombings.

    This shows that the American imperialists are determined to be enemies with the Chinese and Korean people and all honest and kind people in the world to the very end.

    I represent the Council of the Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association in calling on members of local branches and anti-tuberculosis workers across the country to mobilize together, immediately join the ranks of epidemic prevention, participate in the anti-bacteriological warfare, and contribute all their strength to resolutely counter the frantic and shameless American imperialists.

    坚决反击美国侵略者灭绝人性的暴行
    中国防痨协会总干事　裘祖源
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜战场不顾一切地使用了细菌武器。早在若干年前，它就处心积虑地网罗并豢养了一批德日法西斯强盗们研究细菌武器。最近除了在朝鲜前线进行惨无人道的细菌战争外，更把细菌战的范围扩大到我国东北及青岛等地，疯狂地投掷细菌炸弹，散布大量传播细菌的昆虫，并滥施轰炸。
    这就说明了，美帝国主义者决心和中朝人民及全世界正直善良的人民为敌到底。
    我代表中国防痨协会理事会，号召全国各地分会会员及防痨工作者，一致动员起来，立刻参加到防疫的队伍里去，参加到反细菌战的队伍里去，贡献出一切力量，给予疯狂无耻的美帝国主义者以坚决反击。
