    Shameless Scoundrel Zhao Mingzhi Should Make a Public Self-Criticism to the People
    To the Editors: The CCP Hebei Provincial Committee's decision to expel Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan from the Party pointed out: There once was a shameless scoundrel who, at a meeting commemorating the Party's birthday, led the masses in shouting: "Salute the wise leader, Commissioner Zhang!" This shameless scoundrel is Zhao Mingzhi, the former Secretary of the Tianjin District Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and now working in the North China Working Committee of the Youth League. Since Zhao Mingzhi shouted such absurd slogans at a meeting commemorating the Party's birthday, spreading such despicable poison, we can assert: He must have been deeply influenced by the reactionary ideology of the traitors Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, and may have even been bribed.
    The two traitors, Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, have long been executed, but this shameless scoundrel, Zhao Mingzhi, has not yet made a public self-criticism. We believe that the people will not let him get away with it silently.

### 无耻之徒赵明之应该向人民作公开检讨

    无耻之徒赵明之应该向人民作公开检讨
    编辑同志：中共河北省委关于开除刘青山、张子善党籍的决定上曾指出：曾有无耻之徒，在纪念党的生日的大会上，领导群众高呼：“向英明的领袖张专员致敬”。这个无耻之徒就是前中国新民主主义青年团天津地委书记、现在在青年团华北工作委员会工作的赵明之。赵明之既然在纪念党的生日的大会上高呼这种荒谬的口号，散布这种可耻的毒素，我们可以断言：他受叛徒刘青山、张子善的反动思想影响一定很深，并且可能受了贿赂。
    刘青山、张子善这两个叛徒早已被处决了，但赵明之这个无耻之徒却一直没有作公开检讨。我们相信人民是不能让他不声不响地混过去的。
