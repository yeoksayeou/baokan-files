Sun Fengchi Locomotive Repair Group of Jilin Locomotive Depot Factory
    Creates "Double-Layer Operation Method" to Shorten Locomotive Repair Time

    The Sun Fengchi Locomotive Repair Group of Jilin Locomotive Depot Factory, Jilin Railway Administration, created the "Double-Layer Operation Method" for locomotive repair in the process of promoting the Soviet "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System," shortening repair time and improving locomotive utilization efficiency. This advanced working experience has been valued by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government. The Ministry of Railways organized railway workers from across the country to study in Jilin last December, preparing to promote this operation method nationwide.

    The characteristics of the "Double-Layer Operation Method" are: (1) Under the conditions that do not affect the locomotive's cooling, furnace cleaning, water filling, ignition, and steam raising, the repair work in the single-line operation sequence of washing and inspecting locomotives is carried out simultaneously with cooling, furnace cleaning, water filling, ignition, and steam raising as much as possible, to shorten downtime. The previous single-line operation method was: after the locomotive entered the depot and released steam, cooling, furnace cleaning, and other work were carried out on the upper part of the locomotive first, and then repair work was carried out. The double-layer operation method is different; repair and installation work are closely linked in sequence, without wasting a minute or a second. For example, to cooperate with water filling and steam raising, the repair work of the steam section is carried out from top to bottom; after cooling is finished, the steam dome cover is opened to repair and adjust the valve; when the water is drained to expose the crown sheet, the water gauge is repaired; after the water is drained, the drain valve is repaired; before the furnace cleaning work is completed, the work affecting the steam and water parts is completed first. (2) Distribute different levels of work according to the workers' technical proficiency, that is, skilled workers do fine work, and workers with lower skills do ordinary work. This makes it easier for workers to improve their skills and ensures that the repair quality meets the standards. (3) By adopting the double-layer operation method, the locomotive entry time can be set from 5:00 to 6:00 am (previously from 0:00 to 4:00 am), eliminating waiting time before work and shortening the locomotive's stay in the depot.

    In addition, the Sun Fengchi Repair Group has also established systems such as "Three Inspections" (self-inspection, foreman inspection, and inspector inspection), "Mutual Supervision" (mutual supervision to improve quality and mutual supervision to speed up work), and "Centralized Material Requisition" (the foreman collects the required materials centrally every day to avoid wasting working hours due to requisitioning materials when needed and each person requisitioning their own).

    They try their best to shorten the washing and inspection time. In July 1951, they shortened the washing and inspection time to twelve hours and thirty-six minutes. Especially when repairing locomotive Mi-K1-1006, it only took nine hours and thirty-five minutes, creating a new national record for locomotive washing and inspection time at that time.

    The "Double-Layer Operation Method" of the Sun Fengchi Repair Group was created in the process of promoting the Soviet "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System" by overcoming conservative ideas and striving for in-depth research.

    When the Soviet "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System" began to be promoted in the fourth quarter of 1950, the Jilin Locomotive Depot was "ordered" to promote the "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System." The leadership did not thoroughly communicate with the workers, so many workers did not sufficiently recognize its benefits and disliked this "troublesome work" of "disassembling even if it's not broken" and "powder flaw detection." At the same time, the various systems to ensure the "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System" (such as ten-day plans, three-day plans, and thirty-six-hour registration system) were not established. In name, they were doing the "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System," but in reality, the workers were still "working according to the old routine" like they did with the B and C inspections in the past. Therefore, the depot was filled with locomotives awaiting repair without fire, and the repair time was even longer than when the B and C inspection systems were implemented. In January of last year, the average repair time for each locomotive reached sixty-nine hours and twelve minutes. In particular, it took two hundred and fifteen hours for locomotive Mi-K1-613 and two hundred and seventy-eight hours for locomotive S-L3-7 to be repaired. This further fueled the workers' resistance to the "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System." The workers said, "This change has messed everything up!" "Soviet experience is good, but it won't work without those conditions!" At this time, Sun Fengchi did not think so. He thought, "The Soviet Union is a socialist country, and everything is our example. Their experience cannot be bad. The problem is that there is conservatism at work in our thinking." He mobilized the workers in the group to thoroughly follow the operating procedures of the "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System." The four Youth League members and six young workers in the group agreed, but four older workers disagreed. In February, the Administration called for 24-hour dispatch. The section chief was so anxious that he scratched his head and reluctantly implemented it, asking everyone to find a way to ensure it. Some workers said, "Ensure what? We can't do it even if we're exhausted!" Sun Fengchi again mobilized all the workers in the group to try. After full discussion and research by the entire group, they loudly proposed a guarantee of 24-hour dispatch. As a result, locomotive Mi-K1-864 was dispatched from the depot in twenty-five hours, and the average washing and inspection time in February was also shortened to twenty-eight hours and eighteen minutes. From then on, the Sun Fengchi Repair Group cleared the thinking of the older workers, and the whole group worked even harder. The washing and inspection time in March broke the standard and reached twenty-three hours and thirteen minutes. This drove other repair groups to earnestly implement the "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System."

    After the Sun Fengchi Repair Group achieved success, the leadership began to pay attention to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Therefore, Wang Zhizhong, the assistant section chief for repairs, went to the Changchun Locomotive Depot of the China Changchun Railway at the end of March to study the washing and inspection operation process and the ten-day plan, three-day plan, and thirty-six-hour registration system. After returning from the study, he conducted a pilot project in the Sun Fengchi Repair Group in April, which deepened the implementation of the "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System" a step further. For example, in the past, locomotives for washing and inspection entered the depot after 2 or 3 pm. After entering the depot, they underwent operations such as steam release, cooling, water drainage, and furnace cleaning until 7:30 am the next day, when the repair group began to repair. However, the Changchun Locomotive Depot's washing and inspection locomotives entered the depot after midnight; at the same time, the repair group started working before the furnace cleaning was completed, which initially eliminated the interruption of the operation process and shortened the repair time. Also, in the past, only the factory implemented the "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System," and other departments did not interfere. Since the implementation of the ten-day plan and the three-day plan, the people in charge of operation and dispatch have correctly grasped the running mileage of the locomotives and strengthened the planning of locomotive use to ensure that they enter the depot for repair according to the plan and the stipulated time. Since the implementation of the thirty-six-hour registration system, the train drivers have also strengthened their control over the quality of the locomotives so that they can submit the repairs that must be done outside the scope within thirty-six hours before the locomotive enters the depot, so that the factory can prepare materials, tools, etc. as soon as possible. In this way, the implementation of the "Cyclical Washing and Inspection System" has become the overall action of all departments in the entire section. Therefore, the washing and inspection time in April was further shortened to twenty-one hours and thirty-six minutes. Under the education of the Party, Sun Fengchi united the old workers and the technical personnel to work together to shorten every second of the repair time. Finally, he created the "Double-Layer Operation Method."

    The Sun Fengchi Repair Group used the "Double-Layer Operation Method" to gradually shorten the repair time from the initial sixty-nine hours and twelve minutes to about twelve hours. In the past year, among the two hundred and seventy-nine locomotives they repaired, none had a repair responsibility accident due to poor quality. In this way, calculating only the two hundred and twenty-eight locomotives they repaired in the section last year (excluding the fifty-one locomotives repaired in the Tonghua auxiliary team), the time saved by getting the locomotives out of the depot ahead of schedule, according to the indicators set by the Administration, totaled eight hundred and twenty-nine hours. These locomotives, due to good repairs and careful maintenance by the train drivers, extended the scheduled overhaul kilometers by more than one hundred and eighty-six thousand kilometers, which is equivalent to doing forty-seven fewer washing and inspections and using the locomotives for one thousand one hundred and twenty-eight more hours. At the same time, due to their careful calculations and saving of working hours and materials, the average repair cost for each locomotive was only 39% of the repair cost. Adding these all together, the wealth accumulated for the country that can be calculated alone is seventeen hundred and fifty million yuan. The package inspection groups of each locomotive depot factory in the Jilin Railway Administration have accepted their advanced experience, shortening the repair time from the initial average of forty-one hours and twelve minutes to about fifteen hours, which has effectively guaranteed the implementation of railway transportation and the railway locomotive department's economic accounting system.

    吉林机务段工厂孙凤池机车包修组
    创造“双层作业法”缩短机车检修时间
    吉林铁路管理局吉林机务段工厂孙凤池机车包修组，在推行苏联“循环洗检制”的过程中，创造了机车检修的“双层作业法”，缩短了修车时间，提高了机车运用效率。这一先进工作经验受到中央人民政府铁道部的重视。中央铁道部在去年十二月组织了全国各铁路局机务工作者去吉林学习，准备在全国推广这个作业法。
    “双层作业法”的特点是：（一）在不影响机车减温、洗炉、上水、点火、烧汽等条件下，把洗检机车的单线作业顺序中的检修工作，尽量和减温、洗炉、上水、点火、烧汽等工作同时进行，以缩短停修时间。以前的单线作业法是：机车入库放完汽后，先在机车上部进行减温、洗炉等工作，然后再进行检修工作。双层作业法则不一样，修理和安装工作按照顺序紧密衔接，不浪费一分一秒钟。例如，为配合上水、烧汽，蒸汽部的检修工作由上而下地进行，减温终了，即打开汽包盖加修调整阀；放水到露出天顶板时，即加修水表；放水完了，加修放水阀；洗炉工作完成以前，先把影响汽、水部分的工作干完。（二）按工人技术的熟练程度，分配不同等级的工作，即技术熟练的工人做精细活，技术较低的工人做普通活。这就使工人容易提高技术，保证检修质量合乎标准。（三）采用双层作业法，可以把机车入库时间定为上午五点到六点（以前是零点到四点），消灭开工前的等待时间，缩短机车在库内的停留时间。
    此外，孙凤池包修组还订立了“三检”（自己检查、工长检查、验收员检查）、“互监”（互相监视提高质量和互相督促抓紧工作）、“集中领料”（每天由工长把所需材料集中领来，以免现用现领、各人用各人领而浪费工时）等制度。
    他们尽量想办法争取缩短洗检时间，在一九五一年七月份就把洗检时间缩短到十二小时三十六分。特别在修冖ㄎ1一○○六号机车时，只用了九小时三十五分，创造了当时的机车洗检时间的全国新纪录。
    孙凤池包修组的“双层作业法”，是在推行苏联
    “循环洗检制”的过程中，克服保守思想，努力钻研而创造出来的。
    一九五○年第四季度开始推行苏联“循环洗检制”时，吉林机务段是“奉命”推行“循环洗检制”的。领导方面没有深入打通工友们的思想，许多工友对它的好处就认识不够，讨厌这种“不坏也得拆”和“涂粉探伤”的“麻烦活”。同时，保证“循环洗检制”的各项制度（如旬计划、三日计划、三十六小时登记制等）也没有建立。名义上做的是“循环洗检制”，实际上工友们仍然像过去做乙、丙检一样的“照票干活”。因此，那天库内都停有无火待修车，检修时间比实行乙、丙检制时更延长了。去年一月份每台机车平均检修时间竟达六十九小时十二分。特别像冖ㄎ1六一三号机车在库二百十五小时，ㄙ?3七号机车在库二百七十八小时，才修出去。这就更助长了工友们对“循环洗检制”的抗拒。工友们说：“这一改，乱了套啦！”“苏联经验虽好，没那样条件也行不通！”这时，孙凤池就不以为然。他想：“苏联是社会主义国家，样样都是我们的榜样，他们的经验不会差的，问题是我们的思想里有保守主义在作怪。”他就动员组内工友们彻底按照“循环洗检制”的作业程序去作，组里头的四名团员与六名青年工人都同意，但是，四名老年工友中有不赞成的。到了二月份，管理局号召二十四小时出车。段长急得抓头，捏着鼻子往下贯彻，要求大家想办法保证。有的工友说：“保证啥？累死了也干不出来！”孙凤池又动员全组工友试试看。经过全组充分讨论、研究，响亮地提出了二十四小时出车的保证。结果，修冖ㄎ1八六四号机车二十五小时就出了库，二月份的洗检时间也平均缩短到二十八小时十八分。从此，孙凤池包修组打通了老年工人的思想，全组更加了一把劲，三月份的洗检时间就突破了标准，达到了二十三小时十三分。这就带动了其他包修组认真地贯彻了“循环洗检制”。
    孙凤池包修组取得了成绩以后，领导方面对苏联先进经验才重视起来。于是，检修助理段长王志忠于三月末到中长路长春机务段去学习洗检的作业过程和旬计划、三日计划、三十六小时登记制等制度。学习回来以后，四月份就在孙凤池包修组试点，使“循环洗检制”的贯彻，又深入了一步。如过去洗检的机车是下午二、三点以后入库，入库后进行放汽、减温、放水、洗炉等工作，一直到第二天七点半钟，包修组才动手检修。而长春机务段的洗检机车则是零点以后入库；同时不等洗完炉，包修组就上班工作，这就初步消灭了作业过程的中断现象，缩短了修车时间。又如过去只是工厂实行“循环洗检制”，别的部门不过问。自从实行了旬计划和三日计划以后，管运转和调度的人就正确地掌握机车的走行公里，加强机车运用的计划性，以保证按照计划和规定的时间入库检修。自从实行了三十六小时登记制以后，乘务员也就要加强对于机车质量的掌握，以便在机车入库检修的三十六小时以前提出范围外必须检修的活，使工厂早作材料、工具等的准备。这样，“循环洗检制”的贯彻实行，更成为全段各部门的整体的行动了。因此，四月份的洗检时间又缩短到二十一小时三十六分。孙凤池在党的教育下，团结老工人，团结技术人员，共同为缩短一分一秒的修车时间而奋斗。终于创造了“双层作业法”。
    孙凤池包修组运用“双层作业法”，把修车时间由最初的六十九小时十二分逐渐缩短到十二小时左右。去年一年内，他们检修的二百七十九台机车中，没有一台因质量不好而发生过检修责任事故。这样，仅就他们去年一年在本段所修的二百二十八台机车计算（在通化助勤所修的五十一台不计算在内），按管理局所定指标，提前出库的时间累计共八百二十九小时。这些机车由于检修得好和乘务员的细心保养，共延长了十八万六千多定检公里，等于少做了四十七次洗检和多运用了一千一百二十八小时。同时，由于他们精打细算，节省工时、材料，洗检每台机车平均只用了百分之三十九的修车成本费。把这些都加起来，光是能计算出来的，就一共给国家积累了十七亿五千万元的财富。吉林铁路管理局内各机务段工厂的包检组都接受了他们的先进经验，把修车时间由最初平均四十一小时十二分缩短到十五小时左右，有力地保证了铁路运输和铁路机务部门的经济核算制的贯彻实行。（中国铁路工会吉林区委员会生产工资部通讯组）
