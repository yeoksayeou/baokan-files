Xinhua News Agency report: The broad masses of people in North China and Qinghai and Ningxia provinces unanimously support the solemn statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on March 8, protest the brutal crimes of the American invading army in spreading germs, and have expressed their determination to fight the American imperialists to the end with practical actions.

People's organizations in Shanxi, Chahar, and other provinces, in their statements issued on the 10th, unanimously pointed out that this monstrous crime of American imperialism is intolerable to peace-loving people all over the world. People from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Taiyuan, Baotou, Guihua, Sulaqi, Jining and other places held rallies. More than 7,000 women and more than 5,000 young students in Xuanhua and Zhangjiakou held parades and demonstrations, unanimously protesting the inhuman and brutal crimes of American imperialism. Editorial departments of newspapers in various provinces have received countless protest letters from readers, who all expressed their determination to crush this barbaric act of American imperialism, which attempts to destroy humanity, with practical actions. Some schools in Taiyuan have formed volunteer epidemic prevention and inspection teams to go to Korea. Medical personnel from units such as the Zhangjiakou Railway Hospital are preparing to go to the Korean front in the near future to participate in the fight against germ warfare. Branches of the Chinese Medical Association's Germ Warfare Defense Special Committee have been established in Taiyuan and Zhangjiakou.

On March 12, more than 40 representatives from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Qinghai Province held a forum. Yang Xiyao, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Qinghai Provincial Branch of the China Democratic League, Meng Zhaohan, Director of the Xining Municipal Christian Self-Government Reform Movement Committee, and others expressed their determination to crush the germ warfare of the American aggressors. Liang Changhan, Chairman of the Qinghai Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, called on medical and health workers throughout the province to take active action, improve epidemic prevention technology, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. Mongolian herdsmen and lamas from temples in various "Bags" (administrative units, smaller than a district, larger than a village) in the Alxa Banner of Ningxia, located in the northwestern border region of the motherland, also accused the heinous crimes of the American aggressors. Several young archers in Tonghu "Bag" have requested to go to the Korean front to kill the enemy in person. Lama Danbula from the temple in Ailibugai "Bag" said: "The lamas in our temple have decided to actively participate in the local work of eliminating wolves and protecting livestock, and increase the strength of resisting America and aiding Korea." Xia Qida, a herdsman woman from Shugui "Bag", demanded severe punishment for American germ warfare criminals.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th: Medical and health workers, medical experts and professors in Northeast China are enthusiastically heading to the forefront of the anti-germ warfare. Medical experts and professors from the three provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Jilin, and the three cities of Shenyang, Fushun, and Luda, and the epidemic prevention team of the Northeast People's Government's Ministry of Health have formed a powerful epidemic prevention force. Among them are well-known internal medicine expert Wu Zhizhong, associate professor of bacteriology Jing Guanhua, chairman and professor of the Department of Epidemic Prevention Sun Xipu, professor of pathology Li Peilin, professor of parasitology Qin Yaoting, and Ji Zhongpu, who represented our country at the International Physiological Society last year, and others.

The Northeast Epidemic Prevention Team, which has rich experience in epidemic prevention work, has extinguished the large-scale plague caused by Japanese germ warfare criminals in Harbin and other places, and has also marched to the Leizhou Peninsula. Among them are Zhang Xueqian, a first-class meritorious hero who gloriously made contributions in the work of extinguishing the plague in the Leizhou Peninsula, Shi Yongxiang, a first-class meritorious hero who made contributions in extinguishing the plague in Nongan, and Jia Hongyuan, a first-class meritorious hero who made contributions in extinguishing the plague in Tongliao. After seeing the outrageous crimes of American imperialism daring to spread germ-carrying insects on our Northeast territory and slaughtering our people, all the team members were extremely angry. They have all automatically packed their bags, waiting for orders to depart at any time. Zhang Xueqian, the squad leader of the team and a first-class meritorious hero, and others wrote letters of determination, guaranteeing to complete the most arduous tasks in any environment. Currently, a large number of personnel from the team have set off to Andong, Fushun, Ji'an, Xinmin and other places to engage in intensive work.
