    Liu Dexiang Makes Self-Criticism for Withholding Relief Funds
    To the Editor: I have read the reader's criticism, published in the People's Daily on January 25th, of my illegal withholding of funds donated to unemployed workers in Shanghai. This criticism is entirely correct. I now make the following self-criticism:
    In the spring of 1950, workers in the Tong County Special District donated over 29 million yuan to aid unemployed workers in Shanghai. These funds were all turned over to the higher authorities. Afterward, various county-level organizations, enterprises, and units sporadically submitted additional donations totaling over 3.8 million yuan. I then committed the error of departmentalism, thinking that since our district had already donated a considerable amount, it would be better to use this money to aid unemployed workers in our district. However, after withholding these donations, I did not use them to aid unemployed workers in our district but used them for other purposes. Particularly worthy of self-criticism is that last December, I even attempted to use this money for business transactions. Although this did not happen because other cadres disagreed, my erroneous thinking was serious.
    Through studying in the anti-corruption movement, I have realized that my arbitrary withholding of donations without reporting to higher authorities is a serious act of being unorganized and undisciplined, which has created a very bad influence among the masses. In addition to requesting the organization to give me disciplinary action, I also guarantee that, under the leadership of the Party, I will thoroughly eliminate my erroneous thinking and maintain a spirit of hard work and plain living.

    刘德相检讨扣留救济款的错误
    编辑同志：我读了人民日报一月二十五日刊载的读者对我非法扣留捐助上海市失业工人的款项的批评。这个批评完全正确，今作如下检讨：
    一九五○年春天，通县专区工人为了救济上海市失业工人，捐献了二千九百多万元。这些款项都已上缴。之后，各县机关企业单位又零星缴来捐款三百八十多万元。我当时犯了本位主义的错误，认为我区已捐了不少，不如拿这些钱来救济我区的失业工人。但是，我扣留了这批捐款后，并没有救济本区失业工人，却用到其他方面。特别值得检讨的是，在去年十二月份，我曾企图拿这些钱作买卖，虽因其他干部不同意而未成，但我的这种错误思想是严重的。
    经过反贪污运动的学习，我认识到我任意扣留捐款，不报告上级，是一种严重的无组织、无纪律的行为，在群众中造成了很坏的影响。我除了要求组织上给我处分外，并保证在党的领导下，清算错误思想，保持坚苦朴实的作风。
