To the Editor:
    Suihua Station of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau successfully promoted the Li Xikui shunting method for luggage transport during the anti-corruption movement, saving one locomotive. After the anti-corruption movement was launched at the station, the corrupt elements who used to act arrogantly were successively brought to justice, and the workers were able to hold their heads high and their work enthusiasm greatly increased. In February, the leadership called for the promotion of the Li Xikui shunting method. After the workers tried it out, work efficiency gradually increased. After 18 days of trial implementation, they saved one locomotive. In the past, three locomotives assembled and disassembled an average of 90 trains per day, transferring 1,400 vehicles; now, two locomotives assemble and disassemble an average of 95 trains per day, transferring 1,500 vehicles. The turnaround time has been reduced from three hours and eight minutes to three hours and five minutes, and the dwell time has been shortened from eleven hours and two minutes to eight hours and five minutes. Workers' wages have also increased by 30 percent as a result. The workers are more motivated, and shunter Guo Shiming said: "The Li Xikui shunting method is really good. In the past, we were exhausted, but now we are not only not tired, but we have also overfulfilled our production tasks. In the future, I will definitely strengthen the study of advanced experience and further improve work efficiency."

    绥化车站推行李锡奎调车  法节省一台机车效率反而提高
    编辑同志：齐齐哈尔铁路局绥化车站在反贪污运动中，推行李锡奎调车法成功，节用了一台机车。反贪污运动在该站展开后，过去作威作福的贪污分子相继就擒，职工们都扬眉吐气，工作情绪大大高涨。二月份，领导方面号召推行李锡奎调车法。职工试行以后，工作效率日渐提高。试行了十八天，他们就节用了一台机车。过去三台机车每天平均编组解体九十列车，中转一千四百辆；现在两台机车每天平均编组解体九十五列车，中转一千五百辆，中转时间由三小时八分缩到三小时五分，停留时间由十一小时二分缩短到八小时五分。工人的工资也因而提高了百分之三十。职工们越干越有劲，调车员郭世明说：“李锡奎调车法真好。过去累得要命，现在我们不但不累，还超额完成了生产任务。今后我一定加强学习先进经验，把工作效率再提高一步。”
