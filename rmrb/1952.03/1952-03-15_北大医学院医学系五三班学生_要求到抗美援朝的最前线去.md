    Peking University Medical School, Department of Medicine, Class of '53 Students
    Request to Go to the Forefront of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Comrade Editor: We are students of the Department of Medicine. Eliminating bacteria is our task. When we learned that the Chinese people had dispatched the first batch of epidemic prevention and inspection teams to Korea, we were indescribably excited. The newspapers said that the Chinese people would successively send epidemic prevention teams to Korea, which made us even more excited. This is a good opportunity for us to contribute to the motherland and perform meritorious service for the people. We request the higher authorities to allow us to go to the forefront of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to strike at the enemy and eliminate bacteria.
    The entire student body of the Peking University Medical School, Department of Medicine, Class of '53

    要求到抗美援朝的最前线去
    编辑同志：我们是医学系的学生。消灭细菌是我们的任务。当我们知道中国人民派出第一批防疫检验队到朝鲜时，兴奋得无法形容。报上说中国人民将陆续派遣防疫队去朝鲜，使我们更兴奋了。这是我们为祖国贡献力量，为人民立功的好时机。我们要求上级准许我们到抗美援朝的最前线去，打击敌人，消灭细菌。
