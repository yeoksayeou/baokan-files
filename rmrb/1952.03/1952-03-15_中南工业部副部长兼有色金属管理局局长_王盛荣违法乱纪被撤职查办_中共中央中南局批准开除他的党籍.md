Wang Shengrong, former Deputy Director of the Industrial Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee and Director of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau, came from a working-class background, joined the revolution in 1926, and became a member of the Chinese Communist Party. He had made some contributions to the revolution. He had committed several serious errors in his work and had been disciplined by the Party. Since being transferred to the Central South Industrial Department in 1949 for the past two and a half years, he has committed a series of extremely serious errors of principle, even developing into violations of law and discipline, degenerating to the point of being beyond redemption. The Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has approved his expulsion from the Party, and the State Council of the Central People's Government issued an order on the 7th to dismiss him from his post and arrest him for legal action.

Wang Shengrong used his position for personal gain and squandered public funds recklessly. In July 1949, when the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee ordered him to go south, he abandoned his work and spent more than a month in Tianjin, indulging in extravagant eating and drinking. In the two and a half years as the Director of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau, his life became corrupt to an alarming degree. According to preliminary investigations, he spent more than 190 million yuan of public funds on gifts to individuals alone. He squandered 155 million yuan just to renovate his residence. His extravagance and waste in life were even more severe when he traveled to the various branches of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau. When he went to Jiangxi, Song Erlian, the director of the Jiangxi branch, hired a chef especially for him. He indulged in even more debauchery when he was in Guangzhou. Under his influence, extravagance and waste became a common practice in the Central South nonferrous metal industry system. Wang Shengrong also stole huge amounts of state funds and made illegal gifts in his own name. Last autumn, he sent 500 million yuan to the Central Heavy Industry Department Hospital (which was returned in January this year). Wang Shengrong often boasted that the nonferrous metal industry was a "money tree," and even said at a meeting that the Nonferrous Metals Bureau "looks at 100 to 200 million yuan like rice grains falling from a meal." He often said to people: "Come work at my branch, the branch's small villas are very luxurious." He often gave pens and clothing materials to key subordinates to win them over. But he took action against those cadres who could not completely go along with him.

When the Central South Nonferrous Metal Industry was preparing its financial settlement for 1950, the total management fee for the year was only more than 700 million yuan, but he instructed his subordinates to report it as 18.7 billion yuan. In May and June 1951, Wang Shengrong arbitrarily approved the allocation of 50 billion yuan of the 1951 over-planned profits of the nonferrous metal industry to various branches. Afterwards, he deceived the organization with the excuse that "the living conditions of miners are extremely harsh, and there is an urgent need to build dormitories for workers and solve the problem of welfare facilities and medical and health expenses," and requested approval. He also instructed the branches: "The central government can still invest in factories and mines in the future, the branches can only grab a bit this year, and there will be no way when financial discipline becomes stricter next year." The Central South Industrial Department ordered him three times to compile and submit a usage plan, but he refused. By July last year, unplanned investments in the units under the Nonferrous Metals Bureau had increased to 77.5 billion yuan. After criticism from the Central South Industrial Department, Wang Shengrong decided to reduce this unplanned investment to 51 billion yuan. However, by December last year, the actual total amount used by various branches had reached 64 billion yuan. A large part of this fund was used for the construction of magnificent buildings. For example, the Hunan branch spent 5 billion yuan to build an office building; the Jiangxi branch spent more than 10 billion yuan to build office buildings and cultural palaces in Ganzhou. In order to cover up these crimes, Wang Shengrong ordered the branches to divide the funds used into the cost of tungsten, antimony, and manganese through miscellaneous capital expenditure projects.

At the same time, he violated laws and regulations in business management, accumulating a large amount of national funds. For example, in 1950, the central government's investment in nonferrous metals, the Central South branches only used a small part of this investment by August of that year because various tasks had not yet been fully launched. Later, when Wang Shengrong heard that the central government had decided that the investment should be turned over if it was not used up, he took emergency measures: on the one hand, he purchased a large amount of materials such as galvanized iron sheets and gasoline for long-term stockpiling (the gasoline currently stored in Xikuangshan is still enough for one year); on the other hand, he ordered the branches to bury hidden dangers when making engineering settlements. This made the financial system below very chaotic. Some projects were reported as completed when they were only halfway through, and some were even reported as completed before they had even started. This resulted in a large amount of funds that should have been turned over being handled carelessly, resulting in many unnecessary losses.

In order to achieve the purpose of arbitrary squandering, Wang Shengrong refused to submit the financial cost statements of nonferrous metals to the Central South Industrial Department under the pretext of confidentiality. It was clear that the branches had already submitted the statements to the head office, but when the Finance Department of the Central South Industrial Department sent people to retrieve them, he used various methods to deceive his superiors, either saying "it hasn't been sent from below yet" or "there are no accountants below, the costs are a mess, and you can't see anything." Up until now, not a single cost financial statement from the nonferrous industry system has been submitted to the Central South Industrial Department. When the Nonferrous Metals Bureau held a planning meeting in December 1951, the Planning Department of the Central South Industrial Department sent cadres to participate in the meeting. When costs were discussed at the meeting, Wang Shengrong tried to get the sent cadres out so they would not understand the secrets of the costs. The personnel from the Finance Department also often suffered the same treatment. The Central Financial and Economic Commission and the Central Heavy Industry Department wanted to understand the cost of nonferrous metals in Central South, but he also claimed that "it hasn't been submitted from below" or submitted fake costs. The fake costs were often much higher than the actual costs.

In July 1949, Wang Shengrong met Chen Hezeng, the general manager of Tianjin Tongfu Bank, in Tianjin. When he went south in September, he took Chen Hezeng to Wuhan and helped Chen Hezeng establish a Hankou branch of Tongfu Bank in Hankou. Through Wang Shengrong's relationship, Chen Hezeng once purchased a large batch of tobacco leaves from Henan, transported them to Guangzhou, and sold them at the Guangzhou branch of Tongfu Bank. When he went south in 1949, Wang Shengrong used the name of the Logistics Department of the Fourth Field Army to transport eight train cars of wood for private merchants when military transportation was busy and train car scheduling was difficult. In addition, Wang Shengrong often made remarks that undermined policies, damaging the prestige of the Party and the People's Government.

Wang Shengrong also deceived the organization and shielded embezzlers. Zhou Nu'an, an engineer of the Central South Nonferrous Metals Bureau, embezzled and stole a large amount of state property at the Ningxiang Mining Bureau. During the democratic reform, the Ningxiang Mining Bureau sent people to ask for this person, but Wang Shengrong refused. During this anti-corruption struggle, someone criticized this matter, but Wang Shengrong falsely claimed "I don't know about this." He also openly shielded the embezzler Liu Peibao. He once said to Liu Peibao:
    "You and I know about the embezzlement, that's all." In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he also played tricks and resisted the movement. Finally, under the pressure of the masses, he confessed to some facts, but his attitude was extremely dishonest.

From Wang Shengrong's wanton squandering of state property, corruption and degeneration, violation of laws and discipline, disregard for organization, acting arbitrarily, unauthorized use of huge amounts of state funds, and his言行 against policies, it can be seen that he has been thoroughly corrupted by bourgeois ideology, lost the qualities of a Communist Party member, and betrayed the Party and the people. In order to maintain the purity of the Party and safeguard government discipline, with the approval of the State Council, the Central South Military and Political Committee has dismissed Wang Shengrong from his post and arrested him for legal action. The Directly Subordinate Organs Committee of the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has also passed and approved by the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and expelled Wang Shengrong from the Party.

### 中南工业部副部长兼有色金属管理局局长  王盛荣违法乱纪被撤职查办  中共中央中南局批准开除他的党籍

    中南工业部副部长兼有色金属管理局局长
    王盛荣违法乱纪被撤职查办
    中共中央中南局批准开除他的党籍
    原中南军政委员会工业部副部长兼有色金属管理局局长王盛荣，工人出身，一九二六年参加革命，并加入中国共产党。他对革命曾有过一些贡献。在工作中曾犯过几次严重错误，受到过党纪的处分。从一九四九年调到中南工业部工作的二年半以来，又犯了一系列极端严重的原则错误，甚至发展到违法乱纪，蜕化堕落到难于救药的地步。中共中央中南局已批准开除他的党籍，中央人民政府政务院已于七日发布命令将他撤职，并逮捕法办。
    王盛荣平日假公济私，挥霍无度。一九四九年七月，中共中央东北局下令调他南下时，他抛开工作，在天津遨游一个多月，大吃大喝。两年多来在有色金属管理局局长任内，生活的腐化到惊人的程度。据初步调查，仅动用公款向私人送礼一项即达一亿九千余万元。他修饰自己住的宿舍，就挥霍一亿五千五百万元。他出差到有色金属管理局各分局，生活方面的铺张浪费更为厉害。到江西时，江西分局局长宋尔廉为他专请了厨师。到广州时更是花天酒地。在他的影响之下，中南有色金属工业系统中的铺张浪费成了风气。王盛荣还盗窃国家巨款，以私人名义进行非法赠送。去年秋季一次就送中央重工业部医院五亿元（已在今年一月退还）。王盛荣平日到处吹嘘有色金属工业是“摇钱树”，在某次会议上竟说有色金属管理局“看一两亿元像吃饭掉下来的米粒一样”。他常对人说：“到我分局去工作吧，分局的小公馆很阔。”他对主要下级干部常送钢笔、衣料，进行笼络。而对不能完全和他同流合污的干部则施行打击。
    中南有色金属工业在作一九五○年财务决算时，全年管理费只用七亿多元，但他却指示下属报为一百八十七亿元。一九五一年五、六月间，王盛荣把有色金属工业上缴国家的一九五一年度超计划利润擅自批准各分局动用五百亿元。事后又以“矿山职工生活极苦，急需建筑职工宿舍，解决职工福利设备与医药卫生费用”为辞，欺骗组织，请求批准。他并指示分局：“中央将来仍可向厂矿投资，分局只有今年抓一把，明年财政纪律严了便无办法。”中南工业部曾三次下令要他编送使用计划，都被他拒绝。到去年七月，有色金属管理局所属各单位计划外的投资竟增至七百七十五亿元。后经中南工业部批评，王盛荣决定把这笔计划外的投资减为五百一十亿元。但到去年十二月，各分局实际动用总数又达六百四十亿元。这批资金中的很大一部分，是用在建设富丽堂皇的建筑上了。如湖南分局修建办公大楼即用去五十亿元；江西分局竟动用一百多亿元在赣州大肆建筑办公大楼和文化宫。王盛荣为了掩饰这些罪行，竟令各分局以零星资本支出项目，把所用去的款项分别摊入钨、锑、锰的成本中。
    同时，他在经营管理工作中，违法乱纪，积压国家大量资金。如一九五○年中央对有色金属的投资，中南各分局因各种工作还没有全面展开，所以到当年八月才使用了这笔投资中的一小部分。后来王盛荣听说中央决定投资使用不完时即应上缴，便作出紧急措置：一面大量收购白铁皮、汽油等物资，长期积压（锡矿山现存汽油仍够一年之用）；一面令各分局在作工程决算时打埋伏。这样就把下面的财务制度弄得十分混乱。有的工程刚进行一半就报竣工，有的甚至工程还没有动工就报竣工。这就使大量本应上缴的资金，草率处理，遭致了许多不应有的损失。
    王盛荣为达到任意挥霍的目的，藉口保密，拒绝向中南工业部呈送有色金属的财务成本报表。明明各分局已经把报表送达总局，当中南工业部财务处派人去取时，他用种种办法欺瞒上级，不是说“下面还没有送来”，就是说“下边没有会计人员，成本乱七八糟，看不出什么”。一直到现在，有色工业系统的成本财务报表一份也没有呈送中南工业部。一九五一年十二月有色金属管理局开计划会议时，中南工业部计划处派干部去参加会议。会上谈到成本时，王盛荣就设法让派去的干部出去，不让了解成本的秘密。财务处的人员也常遭受同样的待遇。中央财政经济委员会和中央重工业部想了解中南有色金属的成本，也推说“下面未交”，或以假成本呈报。假成本时常高出实际成本很多。
    一九四九年七月，王盛荣在天津结识了天津同孚行总经理陈和曾。九月南下时，即携带陈和曾一道到了武汉，帮助陈和曾在汉口成立同孚行汉口分号。陈和曾通过王盛荣的关系，曾从河南购买大批烟叶，运到广州，在同孚行广州分号销售。一九四九年南下时，王盛荣曾假借第四野战军后勤军需部名义，在军运繁忙，车皮调度困难的时候，替私商贩运木料八车皮。此外，王盛荣经常发表破坏政策的言论，损害党和人民政府的威信。
    王盛荣还欺骗组织，包庇贪污分子。中南有色金属管理局工程师周怒安曾在宁湘矿务局贪污盗窃国家大量资财。在民主改革时，宁湘矿务局派人来要这个人，被王盛荣拒绝了。这次反贪污斗争中有人批评这件事，王盛荣却诡称“不知此事”。对贪污分子刘培宝，他也公开包庇。他曾对刘培宝说：
    “贪污的事，你知道我知道就算了。”在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，他还玩弄手法，抗拒运动。最后在群众的压力下才坦白若干事实，但态度极不老实。
    从王盛荣这种肆意挥霍国家财产，腐化堕落，违法乱纪，目无组织，独断专行，擅自动用国家巨额资金及其违反政策的言行看来，他已彻头彻尾的为资产阶级思想所腐蚀，丧失了共产党员的品质，背叛了党和人民。为了保持党的纯洁，维护政府法纪，经政务院批准，中南军政委员会已将王盛荣撤职逮捕法办。中共中央中南局直属机关委员会也已通过、并经中共中央中南局批准，将王盛荣开除出党。
