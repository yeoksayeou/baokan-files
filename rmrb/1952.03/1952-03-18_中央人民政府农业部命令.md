Order of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government

In the 1951 Patriotic Agricultural Production Increase Movement, many high-yield villages, high-yield agricultural producers' cooperatives, high-yield mutual aid teams, and high-yield model farmers emerged. They possessed a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm and production initiative, enthusiastically responded to the government's call, organized themselves, worked diligently, studied technology, and created new records in China's agricultural production. Their brilliant achievements have become a clear banner for the vast number of farmers to increase production, pointing out the bright future for the further development of agricultural production in New China, and should be gloriously rewarded by the state.

Based on the "Provisional Measures for Rewarding High-Yield Agricultural Production in 1951," and after detailed review, this Ministry has decided on the first batch of award-winning high-yield model individuals, which is hereby announced.

Farmers across the country should conscientiously learn from the advanced experiences of the high-yield models, emulate the high-yield models, and universally increase the yield per unit area. The awarded high-yield models should continue to promote your glory, make persistent efforts, create even higher high-yield records, and lead the masses to increase production. Agricultural workers across the country should earnestly study and promote high-yield experiences, lead the vast number of farmers to launch a more extensive and in-depth patriotic production increase competition movement, in order to bring about more high-yield models. Strive to successfully complete the 1952 agricultural production tasks!

This order.

Minister Li Shucheng
