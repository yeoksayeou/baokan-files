Shandong Jinan Xingye Warehouse Profiteer Wang Ziyi
Should Be Punished for Stealing Large Amounts of State Assets

Editor: Wang Ziyi, the manager of Xingye Warehouse, a big profiteer located at Jingyi Road and Wei 6th Road in Jinan, Shandong Province, stole and swindled large amounts of state assets by falsely reporting prices and bribing cadres when purchasing, selling, and transporting a large number of commodities for the Liaocheng Branch of the Pingyuan Provincial Grain Company. For example, on a certain day in 1949, the Liaocheng Branch entrusted him to sell more than 53,700 square feet of native cloth at a price of 2,860 yuan per foot, but the market price that day was 4,000 yuan per foot. Therefore, he sold each foot of cloth for more than 1,000 yuan less. In the same year, Wang Ziyi sold vulcanized blue, black dates, diao ash, black electric powder, etc., on behalf of the Liaocheng Branch, for a total of more than 21.5 million yuan less than the market price. In January 1950, Wang Ziyi managed cotton on behalf of the Liaocheng Branch and stole state assets worth 451.6 million yuan. In 1949, Wang Ziyi purchased 188 boxes of matches on behalf of the Liaocheng Branch and stole more than 4.8 million yuan from them. He also purchased 6,939 pieces of miscellaneous wood padding and stole more than 200.65 million yuan from them.

In October 1951, the branch sent Wang Shaofu to Jinan to purchase a large number of padding. Wang Ziyi felt that this was a good opportunity to make a fortune, so he took Wang Shaofu to live in a hotel and invited Wang Shaofu to watch operas, eat, and visit Daming Lake. During the conversation, he learned that Wang Shaofu had hemoptysis, so he said, "Young people get hemoptysis. It's dangerous if you don't see a doctor quickly!" Wang Shaofu said, "I don't have money, so I can't treat it!" Wang Ziyi immediately said, "I will buy this batch of wood for you. If I make money, I will give you 10 to 20 million yuan to treat your illness." Wang Shaofu was weak-willed and was deceived by this profiteer's sweet words. In this wood transaction, Wang Ziyi stole 73 million yuan of state assets.

After preliminary inspection, it has been found that Wang Ziyi has bribed five or six cadres and stolen more than 900 million yuan of state assets. I request the government to severely punish this profiteer and hope that the responsible comrades of the Liaocheng Branch will conduct a deep self-criticism.

    山东济南兴业货栈奸商王子义
    大量盗窃国家资财应受惩办
    编辑同志：济南市经一路纬六路兴业货栈经理大奸商王子义，在给平原省粮食公司聊城分公司代购、代销、转运大批商品时，虚报价格，贿赂干部，大量盗骗国家资财。如一九四九年某日，聊城分公司委托他出售五万三千七百多方尺土布，售价每尺二千八百六十元，但当日市价是每尺四千元，因此，每尺布少卖了一千多元。同年王子义代售的硫化青、乌枣、刁灰、黑电粉等，共少售二千一百五十多万元。一九五○年一月王子义代聊城分公司经营棉花，盗窃国家资财达四亿五千一百六十多万元。一九四九年王子义代聊城分公司购进火柴一百八十八箱，从中盗取了四百八十多万元，代购杂木垫木六千九百三十九根，从中盗取了二亿零六百五十多万元。
    一九五一年十月，分公司派王少甫去济南采购大批垫木，王子义觉得这是个发财的好机会，就把王少甫接到客店去住，请王少甫看戏、吃饭、逛大明湖。在谈吐间，他知道王少甫有咯血症，于是就说：“你年青人得吐血病，不赶快看可危险呀！”王少甫说：“我没钱，不能治！”王子义马上说：“这批木头，我替你买，赚下了钱，送你一两千万就可以治病了。”王少甫意志薄弱，就被这个奸商的甜言蜜语所蒙蔽了。在这次木材买卖中，王子义盗骗了国家资财七千三百万元。
    经过初步检查，现已发现王子义曾向五、六个干部行贿，盗窃国家资财九亿元以上。我要求政府严惩这个奸商，并希望聊城分公司的负责同志进行深刻的检查。　　　　　郭子韬
