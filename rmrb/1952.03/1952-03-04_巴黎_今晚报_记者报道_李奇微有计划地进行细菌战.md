    Paris "Ce Soir" Reporter Reports
    Ridgway Systematically Conducts Germ Warfare
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] Paris "Ce Soir" reporter Pierre Béguin reported from Kaesong on February 29th: Further details of Ridgway's germ warfare in Korea reveal that Ridgway's troops suddenly withdrew from the front line the night before airplanes dropped insects carrying bacteria. On the morning of the 29th, I visited a member of the Chinese People's Volunteers who was on a mission 45 kilometers northeast by east of Kaesong and 15 kilometers northwest of Cheorwon. He saw three airplanes flying from the direction of Cheorwon at 1:00 PM on February 11th, circling over an area about 10 kilometers north of the demarcation line. He said: "These planes circled twice, flying very low, and scattered a black mist-like substance. About an hour later, we found piles of flies and fleas scattered on the snow on the hillside. In one place, there were more than a thousand fleas in an area of one square meter." Local Korean residents said that they had never seen such fleas before, and that flies would not appear in this area until the end of March at the earliest. An old farmer said that he had lived here for sixty-three years, but had never seen such fleas. Coincidentally, the Chinese-Korean patrol in this area discovered that the American troops had retreated on the night of February 10th, apparently to protect the American troops from the effects of Ridgway's germ warfare.

    李奇微有计划地进行细菌战
    【新华社一日讯】巴黎“今晚报”记者贝却敌二月二十九日自开城报道称：李奇微在朝鲜进行细菌战的更进一步详情表明，在飞机投下带有细菌的昆虫的前一天晚上，李奇微的军队突然撤离了前线。二十九日早晨，我访问了一位曾在开城东北偏东四十五公里、铁原西北十五公里的地点执行任务的中国人民志愿军人员。在二月十一日下午一时，他看到三架飞机从铁原那面飞来，在分界线以北约十公里的地区上空盘旋。他说：“这几架飞机飞了两个圈，飞得很低，撒下了一阵黑雾似的东西。大约一个钟头以后，我们发现山坡的积雪上散布着一堆堆的苍蝇和跳蚤。在一个地方，一平方公尺的面积内就有一千多个跳蚤。”当地的朝鲜居民说，他们以前从来没有见过这种跳蚤，而且这一带最早也得三月底以后才会有苍蝇。一位年老的农民说，他在这里已经住了六十三年，但是从来没有见过这样的跳蚤。凑巧得很，这个地区朝中方面的巡逻队发现美国军队在二月十日晚上撤退了，显然这是为了使美国军队免受李奇微的细菌战的影响。
