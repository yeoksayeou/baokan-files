    Qianxi County People's Government, Hebei Province
    Should Protect Mountain Forests and Stop Destructive Phenomena
    In Qianxi County, Hebei Province, destructive phenomena are occurring in the mountain forests due to lax management by the local government. In recent years, the people of Qianxi County have responded to the government's call to close off hillsides for afforestation, and vegetation has grown on the mountains, preserving the soil and water. However, last winter, a few farmers, because they had not prepared firewood, dug up the roots of scrub trees on the sunny slopes of Chaoyang Mountain after the spring, even scraping away the sod. This has a great destructive effect on the mountain forests. For example, on the sunny slopes of Dabeishan in Chengxi Yu, Wangjiafen in Zhaoyan Zhou Village, and Taluanyu, the red soil has been exposed by digging, and they can no longer retain moisture. We believe that the local people's government should pay attention to this issue. In addition to effectively stopping the digging and giving the forest destroyers their due punishment, they should also vigorously educate the farmers to consider the long-term interests of all the people and consciously protect the mountain forests.

    河北迁西县人民政府
    应保护山林制止破坏现象
    河北省迁西县境内的山林，由于当地政府管理不严格，又发生破坏现象。近几年来，迁西县的人民响应政府号召，实行封山育林，山上长起了草木，保持了水土。但是去年冬天，有少数农民因为没有准备柴草，竟在开春后挖掘朝阳山坡上的疙疸树根，连草皮子都铲光了，这对山林的破坏作用很大。如城西峪大北山、照燕洲村的王家坟、撘峦峪等朝阳山坡都刨的露出红土，不能保持水分了。我们认为当地人民政府应该重视这一问题，除了有效地制止刨掘并给破坏山林分子以应得的处罚外，还应该大力教育农民，为全体人民的长期利益着想，自觉地保护山林。    赵一  马永勋
