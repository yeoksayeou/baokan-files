Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The Japanese Yoshida government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on the 15th that the Yoshida government had decided not to issue passports to Japanese representatives attending the International Economic Conference and Professor Oyama Ikuo, winner of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin International Prize, for travel to the Soviet Union.

    Oyama Ikuo issued a statement that day, denouncing the Yoshida government's fascist behavior, saying: The Yoshida government's measure to refuse to sign passports for representatives attending the International Economic Conference and for himself completely violates the Japanese people's hope for world peace. The statement said: This measure by the Yoshida government is precisely to tell the people who is preparing for war and who is provoking war. Oyama Ikuo denounced the Yoshida government's shameless slander against the Soviet government. He said: All Japanese working people will further launch a strong struggle against the illegal actions of the Yoshida government to defend the constitution and peace.

    At the same time, Hoashi Kaoru, a representative attending the International Economic Conference, also made a statement on the 15th, denouncing the Yoshida government's refusal to issue passports as an act of violence that tramples on the freedom of travel stipulated in the Japanese Constitution and violates basic human rights. He also stated that he would submit the facts of the Yoshida government's violation of basic human rights to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.

    Prior to this, Hoashi Kaoru and another Japanese representative invited to participate in the International Economic Conference, Miyakoshi Kisuke (Diet member of the Reform Party), had filed a lawsuit with the Tokyo District Court on the 11th against the Yoshida government's unconstitutional act of refusing to issue passports.
