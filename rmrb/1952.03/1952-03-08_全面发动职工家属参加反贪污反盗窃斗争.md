    Fully Mobilize Workers' Families to Participate in the Struggle Against Corruption, Theft, and Speculation
    All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Women Workers Department

    Since the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-theft, and anti-speculation movement, in units where education has been conducted among workers' families and workers' families have been fully mobilized to participate in the struggle, the class consciousness of workers' families has been significantly enhanced. They actively mobilize corrupt elements to confess, provide clues about corrupt elements, and work with workers to encircle and suppress corrupt officials, playing a significant role. However, there are still many units where leading cadres have not recognized that fully mobilizing workers' families is an indispensable part of winning the anti-corruption, anti-theft, and anti-speculation struggle. They have not conducted extensive policy education among workers' families, nor have they fully mobilized and organized workers' families to participate in this movement, only working on the families of individual corrupt elements when problems arise. In some units, workers' families have already taken action, but the leadership has not paid attention to it, allowing it to drift. The masses of workers' families do not understand the principles and specific tasks of the anti-corruption, anti-theft, and anti-speculation movement, and are busy examining their own trivial matters, relaxing their attack on major corrupt elements. Some factories are already pursuing major corrupt elements, but have not collected materials from the families of the masses, thereby affecting the movement. Some units even believe that "family members are at home all day washing clothes and cooking, and do not understand the details of corrupt elements, so it is useless to mobilize them," and do not carry out the work. Because workers' families do not understand and care about the anti-corruption, anti-theft, and anti-speculation movement, capitalists have taken advantage of the loopholes and done "family work."奸商The cunning merchants use "jobs" to threaten family members, "favor" to deceive family members, and "gifts" to entice family members, trying everything possible to get family members to obstruct workers from reporting奸商the cunning merchants. Zhao Jichuan, the manager of the Beijing Tiantai Hardware Store奸商and a cunning merchant, fearing that shop assistant Ding Zhenying would report him, even sent someone to the countryside to bring Ding's father, saying that "grandfather is seriously ill" and insisting that Ding return home.

    Now, the anti-corruption, anti-theft, and anti-speculation movement is developing with increasing momentum. Workers and shop assistants across the country have torn off their masks with the capitalists and are engaged in face-to-face struggles with illegal capitalists. For this struggle, all grassroots trade unions must strengthen their leadership and fully mobilize workers' families to participate in this serious class struggle. It is recommended that a dedicated person be responsible for family work under the unified leadership of the thrift inspection committee. For example, the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Thrift Inspection Committee has set up a family work group, the Beijing Mentougou Coal Mine's Thrift Inspection Committee has absorbed the director of the family committee to participate in the work, and the State-owned Tianjin Third Cotton Textile Factory's Thrift Inspection Committee Office directly leads the family work, all of which have achieved results. In order to educate workers' families to cherish state property and recognize the nature of the bourgeoisie, this movement must be used to universally raise the class consciousness of workers' families and actively mobilize corrupt elements to confess, assist and encourage workers to boldly report奸商the cunning merchants, in order to strive for the complete victory of the anti-corruption, anti-theft, and anti-speculation movement.

    全面发动职工家属参加反贪污反盗窃斗争
    中华全国总工会女工部
    反贪污、反盗窃运动开展以来，凡是在职工家属中进行了教育，全面发动职工家属参加了斗争的单位，职工家属的阶级觉悟都显著提高，积极动员贪污分子坦白，提供贪污分子的线索，和职工一起围剿贪污犯，并起了很大作用。但还有许多单位，领导干部没有认识到充分发动职工家属是争取反贪污反盗窃斗争胜利不可缺少的一环，没有在职工家属中进行广泛的政策教育，没有全面地发动组织职工家属参加这个运动，只是在遇到问题时，对个别贪污分子的家属进行工作。有些单位的职工家属已经动了起来，但领导人员没有给予重视，而任其自流。职工家属群众不明了反贪污、反盗窃运动的方针和具体任务，忙于检讨自己的一些琐细小事，放松了对大贪污犯的进攻。有的工厂已经在追剿大贪污分子了，但没有在家属群众中搜集材料，因而使运动受到影响。有的单位甚至认为：“家属整天在家里洗衣、作饭，不了解贪污分子的底细，发动起来也没有用”，而不去进行工作。职工家属对反贪污、反盗窃运动不了解，不关心，资本家就钻了空子，做了“家属工作”。奸商们用“饭碗”来威胁家属，用“情面”来欺骗家属，用“送礼”来利诱家属，想尽办法要家属来阻挠职工检举奸商。北京天泰五金行经理奸商赵济川，怕店员丁振瀛检举他，甚至派人到乡下把丁的父亲请来，说“祖父病重”，一定要丁回家。
    现在，反贪污、反盗窃运动正在日益高涨地开展，全国的工人、店员都已和资本家撕破了脸皮，向违法资本家进行面对面的斗争。对于这一斗争，各个基层工会必须加强领导，全面发动职工家属参加这场严重的阶级斗争，并建议在节约检查委员会统一领导下有专人负责做家属工作。如上海铁路局节约检查委员会下设家属工作组，北京门头沟煤矿节约检查委员会吸收家属委员会主任参加工作，国营天津第三棉纺织厂节约检查委员会办公室直接领导家属工作，都做出了成绩。为了教育职工家属爱护国家财产，认识资产阶级的本质，必须通过这次运动，使职工家属普遍提高阶级觉悟，并积极地动员贪污分子坦白，协助和鼓励职工大胆检举奸商，以争取反贪污反盗窃运动的完全胜利。
