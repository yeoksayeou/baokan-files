    Changchun Cigarette Factory Leadership
    Should Quickly Improve Worker Safety and Welfare Facilities
    Comrade Editor: The Changchun Cigarette Factory leadership's disregard for worker safety and welfare has reached an intolerable level. The cigarette preparation workshop and the cigarette rolling workshop lack sanitary facilities. The double-paned windows are closed all day long, and the rooms are filled with smoke vapor and tobacco dust. Most of the workers have developed lung diseases and bronchitis. Workers have repeatedly suggested installing skylights to improve the equipment, but the leadership turns a blind eye. The canteen issue is similar. Workers pay 42 cents a month for meals, but they are often served moldy rice and rotten vegetable stalks. Because everyone is not getting enough to eat, those who have money go out to eat, and those who don't have money have to go hungry. Of the more than 800 female workers in the packaging workshop, more than 200 have become ill. I urge the factory leadership to quickly correct this bureaucratic style of work and promptly improve worker safety and welfare work.

### 长春制烟厂领导方面  应速改善工人安全福利设施

    长春制烟厂领导方面
    应速改善工人安全福利设施
    编辑同志：东北长春制烟厂领导方面漠视工人的安全和福利，已达到令人不能容忍的程度。香烟预备车间和卷烟车间，没有卫生设备，双层玻璃整天关着，满屋子充塞了烟的蒸汽及烟粉。工人们多数生了肺病和肺管支炎。工人多次提意见要求安天窗改善设备，领导方面却熟视无睹。食堂问题也是如此。工人们每月出四十二分伙食费，但经常吃的是霉烂米、坏菜梗。大家因为吃不饱，有钱的就到外面去吃，没钱的只好挨饿。包装车间八百多女工，得病的已有二百多。我要求该厂领导方面赶快纠正这种官僚主义作风，迅速改善工人的安全和福利工作。    谭毅
