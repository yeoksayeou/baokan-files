Xinhua News Agency, March 24th: The American aggressors, who have been frantically waging germ warfare against the Korean and Chinese people in violation of international law and humanitarian principles, are exposed and embarrassed by the irrefutable evidence and the increasingly surging just condemnation from people all over the world. Thus, they racked their brains to play a despicable and clumsy trick, raising the banners of the "International Committee of the Red Cross" and the "World Health Organization," two organizations they use as instruments. They also gathered their large and small lackeys, minions, and running dogs, clamoring for "on-site investigations" and "technical assistance," attempting to deceive the people of the world and cover up their heinous crimes of using germs to massacre humanity. Furthermore, they sought to allow the special agents employed by the American aggressors to infiltrate the rear of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies to gather intelligence and carry out other unspeakable crimes.

To achieve this goal, the American aggressors played their first trick. On March 4th, while categorically denying the American aggressors' crimes of conducting germ warfare, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson declared that he "welcomed an impartial investigation by an organization like the International Committee of the Red Cross." On March 11th, Acheson telegraphed the International Committee of the Red Cross, asserting that the committee was "an impartial and selfless international organization" and again advocated that the committee "arrange for investigation matters." To embolden themselves and create public opinion, the American aggressors directed their large and small lackeys, running dogs, and minions to bark in unison. On the 14th, the British Foreign Office spokesman hastily declared, "Britain welcomes the Red Cross investigation into the Communist accusations of American germ warfare in Korea." The American running dog newspaper "Manila Times" in the Philippines also hurriedly came out to echo the sentiment, obediently following the American master's instructions, calling the "International Committee of the Red Cross" "possibly the only completely impartial and non-partisan organization in the world" and "an organization with the sole aim of seeking human welfare." At the United Nations Disarmament Commission, U.S. Representative Cohen, under the solemn questioning of Soviet Representative Malik, once again brought out this fig leaf of requesting an investigation by the "International Committee of the Red Cross." Representatives from Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek gang immediately echoed in unison, barking wildly.

Based solely on the American aggressors and their servants' trust in this organization and their constant praise of it as "impartial and selfless," the people of the world have ample reason and necessity to study what this organization actually is. Please look at a few recent "impartial and selfless" records of this "impartial and selfless" "International Committee of the Red Cross"! Since American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, it has been serving the American aggressor army in South Korea in the name of implementing the Geneva Convention. However, it turned a blind eye to the American aggressors' acts of destroying peaceful Korean towns and villages and slaughtering the Korean people, which clearly violated international conventions. It is said to be a humanitarian organization "with the sole aim of seeking human welfare," but it did not intervene in the slightest when the American aggressors inhumanely abused, threatened, and slaughtered the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, even to the point of using captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies for germ experiments. After receiving the investigation report from the International Women's Investigation Team on the atrocities of the American and Li forces in Korea, it hurriedly cited the 1939 regulations, declaring that it had no power to investigate incidents violating and undermining international law, for fear that someone would ask it to investigate. However, after receiving the order from U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, it not only did not declare itself "powerless," but instead took unprecedentedly swift action. On March 4th, Acheson said he welcomed it to investigate, and on the 5th, it telegraphed the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army and the Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, requesting to go to the rear of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. On March 11th, Acheson openly proposed that the "International Committee of the Red Cross arrange for investigation matters," and on the 12th, it telegraphed Acheson, expressing its loyalty and thoughtfully proposing to form a special committee composed of "some people who are fully guaranteed to be morally and scientifically independent" to conduct the investigation. Such a thoughtful servant clearly won the master's favor. Acheson immediately replied, expressing his "admiration" for the committee's "swift action."

These irrefutable facts fully prove that the so-called "impartial and selfless" International Committee of the Red Cross is not only not an "organization with the sole aim of seeking human welfare," but also the most evil, most shameless, and most despicable accomplice and running dog of American imperialism in its bloody aggression. Can there still be any doubt about this?

From this, it can be seen that the purpose of the International Committee of the Red Cross in going to Korea to investigate is clearly to investigate the effects of the American aggressors' heinous germ warfare and, after the "investigation," to use a worthless report to exonerate the aggressor murderers. In fact, the American aggressors have carelessly revealed their latter despicable purpose. In his telegram to the International Committee of the Red Cross on March 11th, Acheson clearly affirmed that the committee's "investigation" "will provide evidence to illustrate the untruthfulness of the accusations regarding germ warfare." This is precisely an involuntary confession of the American swindlers' attempt to achieve this despicable goal!

The American aggressors' trick of attempting to use the banner of the International Committee of the Red Cross to carry out conspiratorial activities is so despicable and shameless, but also so clumsy and easily recognized, that they came up with a second trick – "providing assistance." On March 21st, the American aggressors again instructed their loyal servant, UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, to come forward in the name of the so-called "World Health Organization," fabricating rumors and expressing to our government and the Korean government their willingness to "provide technical assistance to put out the plague reportedly occurring in North Korea." Acheson followed up with a lying statement: "The U.S. government is fully prepared to cooperate with the World Health Organization in assisting victims of epidemic diseases in North Korea."

A robber actually has a change of heart, this is simply a strange thing in the world! However, by lifting the curtain, people can easily see that this trick is nothing new. As everyone knows, this so-called "World Health Organization" is a specialized agency of the "United Nations," and this "United Nations" organization has long become an instrument of American aggression. Under the manipulation of the American aggressors, the United Nations, one year and nine months ago, in June 1950, further used its blue flag to cover up the criminal war of aggression launched by the United States to enslave the Korean people. Subsequently, this "United Nations" controlled by the United States, in February 1951, also reversed right and wrong and passed a shameful proposal slandering our country as an "aggressor," thereby further exposing its ugly face as an instrument of American aggression and an enemy of the Chinese and Korean peoples. At the same time, this UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, who sent a telegram to our government and the Korean government, has become world-renowned as a "subservient servant of the American imperialists" and "a chamberlain of Wall Street" because of his utter loyalty to his American masters.

As for this "specialized agency" under the so-called "United Nations" organization, the "World Health Organization," like many other agencies under the name of the "United Nations," is completely controlled by the American aggressors. It is a espionage agency operating in the name of "promoting human health," but in reality, it conducts criminal activities for American imperialism. It has not taken any steps to promote human health, but rather collects and studies intelligence on public health measures, drug manufacturing, and medical supplies in various countries. In fact, this hypocritical American puppet organization has long revealed its ferocious face of hostility towards the Chinese people. Since March 1951, the Singapore epidemic station under its jurisdiction has issued announcements fabricating our country's "epidemic situation" four times, absurdly declaring all our ports as "plague ports."

The matter is already very clear. The so-called "technical assistance" proposal put forward by the American aggressors, instructing their servant Trygve Lie to come forward in the name of the "United Nations" specialized agency, the "World Health Organization," which is covered in dirt, has the same shameful purpose as the so-called "on-site investigation by the International Committee of the Red Cross" that the American aggressors are desperately demanding. This is also an attempt by the American aggressors to cover up the sky with one hand, conceal the heinous crimes they have committed in conducting germ warfare, and enable American special agents to sneak into the rear of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies to carry out their unspeakable criminal activities.

No matter what tricks the American aggressors painstakingly play, they will obviously never succeed in front of the Chinese and Korean people and peace-loving people of the world. The American aggressors' crimes of conducting germ warfare are numerous and cannot be concealed by any sophistry, slander, or trickery. All materials prove that the American aggressors' conduct of germ warfare is a planned and purposeful action. In a report on March 4th, a United Press reporter, De Borchgrave, who had just returned to the United States from Korea, inadvertently revealed this heinous conspiracy of the American aggressors. He revealed that one of the motivations for the American aggressors to delay and obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations and "not rush to seek a solution" was because the American aggressors believed that "Korea is a particularly useful place to test weapons." Isn't this powerful evidence against the American aggressors' planned germ warfare?

The crimes of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare will surely be subject to the most severe just sanctions, and all those who help the American aggressors to cover up their bloody crimes will also suffer the consequences of their evil activities.

    艾奇逊抵赖不了美国细菌战罪行
    新华社再次揭穿“红十字国际委员会”和“世界卫生组织”的假面具
    【新华社二十四日讯】违反国际公法和人道原则对朝中人民疯狂进行细菌战的美国侵略者，在铁证如山的有力指控和全世界人民日益汹涌的正义声讨面前，罪恶昭彰，狼狈不堪，于是挖空心思玩弄一套可恶的而且也是拙劣的把戏，抬出了“红十字国际委员会”和“世界卫生组织”这两块御用组织的招牌，并纠集大小奴仆、喽啰、走狗，叫嚣什么要进行“实地调查”和“提供技术援助”，妄想借此蒙蔽世界人民的耳目，掩盖其使用细菌屠杀人类的滔天罪行；并进而使美国侵略者所雇用的特务分子得以混到朝中人民军队的后方，进行刺探情报和其他不可告人的罪恶勾当。
    美国侵略者为了达到这个目的，于是耍起了第一套戏法。三月四日，美国国务卿艾奇逊在矢口抵赖美国侵略者进行细菌战罪行的同时，声明“欢迎由像红十字国际委员会这样的机构进行公正的调查。”三月十一日，艾奇逊又致电红十字国际委员会，断言该会是“一个公正无私的国际机构”，再次主张由该会“安排进行调查的事宜”。为了张胆壮势和制造舆论，美国侵略者并指挥其大小奴仆、走狗、喽啰一齐狂吠。英国外交部发言人在十四日急忙声明：“英国欢迎红十字会调查共产党指责美国在朝鲜进行细菌战一事”。远在菲律宾的美国走狗报纸“马尼拉时报”也慌忙出台帮腔，卑顺地遵照美国主子的意旨，把“红十字国际委员会”称为“可能是世界上唯一完全无偏无党的组织”、“以谋求人类福利为唯一目标的组织”。在联合国裁减军备委员会上，美国代表柯亨在苏联代表马立克的严正质问下，又拿出了这块要求由“红十字国际委员会”进行调查的遮羞布，英国、希腊、荷兰、土耳其以及蒋记残余匪帮的代表，也立即齐声附和，狺狺狂吠。
    就凭美国侵略者和它的仆从们如此信赖这个组织、口口声声称赞它为“公正无私”这一点，全世界人民就有充分的理由和必要来研究一下这个组织究竟是个什么东西了。请看这个“公正无私”的“红十字国际委员会”最近活动的几笔“公正无私”的记录！自从美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以来，它就以奉行日内瓦公约的名义在南朝鲜替美国侵略军服务，可是它对于美国侵略者破坏朝鲜和平城乡、屠杀朝鲜人民等显然违反国际公约的暴行却置若罔闻。据说它是“以谋求人类福利为唯一目标的”人道主义组织，可是它对于美国侵略者灭绝人性地虐待、威胁、屠杀朝中人民军队的被俘人员，以至把朝中人民军队的被俘人员作细菌试验，却丝毫不加干预。它在收到了国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团的调查报告后，曾经因为怕有人要它调查，于是急忙引证一九三九年的规定，声明自己并无权力调查违反和破坏国际公法的事件。可是，它在接到美国国务卿艾奇逊的命令后，它不但不声明自己“无权”，相反地，采取了空前迅速的行动。三月四日，艾奇逊说欢迎它去调查，它在五日就致电朝鲜人民军最高司令官和中国人民志愿军司令员要求到朝中人民军队后方。十一日，艾奇逊公开提出要“红十字国际委员会安排进行调查的事宜”，它在十二日就致电艾奇逊，表示效忠，并设想周到地提出要由“一些完全保证在道德上和科学上具有独立性的人们”组成一个特别委员会来调查。奴才如此体贴人意，显然博得了主子的欢心。艾奇逊马上复电，对该会的“迅速行动”，表示“感佩”。
    这些无可辩驳的事实，充分证明了所谓“公正无私”的红十字国际委员会，不但不是什么“以谋求人类福利为唯一目标的组织”，而且是美帝国主义进行血腥侵略的最恶劣、最无耻、最卑贱的同谋和走狗，这难道还能有丝毫怀疑的余地吗？
    由此可见，红十字国际委员会要到朝鲜调查的目的，显然是为了替美国侵略者调查他们进行罪恶的细菌战的效果，并在“调查”之后，以一文不值的报告来洗脱侵略者杀人犯的罪名。事实上，美国侵略者对于它的后一个卑鄙目的已不小心地泄露了出来。艾奇逊在十一日致红十字国际委员会的电报中，就已经明明白白地肯定：该会的“调查”，“将提供佐证，说明关于细菌战的指责的不真实性”。这正是美国骗子们企图达到这个卑鄙目的的不打自招的供词！
    美国侵略者妄想利用红十字国际委员会的招牌来进行阴谋活动的戏法，是如此卑鄙无耻、但又如此拙劣而易被识破，因此又拿出了第二套戏法——“提供援助”。三月二十一日，美国侵略者又指使它的忠实的奴仆——联合国秘书长赖伊出面，以所谓“世界卫生组织”的名义，制造谣言，向我国政府和朝鲜政府表示，愿“提供技术援助扑灭所传北朝鲜发生的瘟疫”。艾奇逊跟着作了一个撒谎的声明：“美国政府完全准备与世界卫生组织合作在北朝鲜援助流行疫病的受难者。”
    强盗竟然发起善心来了，这简直是人间怪事！可是，揭开它的幕布，人们不难看出这套戏法并不是什么新鲜东西。大家知道，这个所谓“世界卫生组织”乃是“联合国”的一个专门机构，而这个“联合国”组织早已经成为美国的侵略工具。在美国侵略者的操纵下，联合国在一年另九个月以前，即一九五○年六月，进一步把自己的蓝色的旗帜用来掩盖美国为了奴役朝鲜人民而发动的罪恶的侵略战争。接着，这个美国把持下的“联合国”在一九五一年二月又颠倒是非地通过了诬蔑我国为“侵略者”的可耻提案，从而更进一步地暴露了它是美国的侵略工具、并和中朝两国人民为敌的丑恶面目。同时，这个出面打电报给我国政府和朝鲜政府的“联合国”的秘书长赖伊，由于他对美国主子的忠心耿耿，已以“美帝国主义者的百依百顺的奴仆”和“华尔街的侍从长”而闻名于世。
    至于这个所谓“联合国”组织下的“专门机构”
    “世界卫生组织”，它和“联合国”名下的其他许多机构一样，是由美国侵略者所完全掌握的。它是一个以“促进人类健康”为名，其实是为美帝国主义进行罪恶活动的谍报性机构。它并没有采取任何步骤来促进什么人类的健康，而是收集和研究各国公共卫生措施、药品制造及医药供应等情报。事实上，这个假冒为善的美国御用机关早就露出了仇视中国人民的凶恶面目。一九五一年三月以来，它所管辖的新加坡疫情站曾四次发表捏造我国“疫情”的通告，荒谬地宣布我国全部港口为“疫港”。
    事情已经十分明显，美国侵略者指使其奴仆赖伊出面，以满身肮脏的“联合国”专门机构“世界卫生组织”名义提出的所谓“提供技术援助”的建议，和美国侵略者竭力要求的所谓“红十字国际委员会实地调查”，具有同样的可耻目的，这同样是美国侵略者企图借此一手蔽天，掩盖它所犯下进行细菌战的滔天罪行，并使美国特务分子得以钻进朝中人民军队的后方，进行其不可告人的罪恶活动。
    不管美国侵略者费尽心机玩弄任何诡计，在中朝人民和世界爱好和平人民的面前显然都是绝对不能得售的。美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪迹累累，决不是任何狡赖、污蔑和玩弄把戏所能掩盖得了的。一切材料证明：美国侵略者进行细菌战是有计划有目的的行动。新自朝鲜返美的合众社记者迪波尔在三月四日的一篇报道中，也曾不注意地泄露了美国侵略者的这一万恶阴谋。他透露美国拖延和阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，“不急于迅速求得解决”的动机之一，乃是因为美国侵略者认为“朝鲜是一个用来试验武器的特别有用的地方”。这不是美国侵略者有计划地进行细菌战的有力反证吗？
    美国侵略者进行细菌战的罪行必将受到最严厉的正义的制裁，所有那些帮同美国侵略者来掩盖其血腥罪行的人们也必将因为他们的罪恶活动而自食恶果。
