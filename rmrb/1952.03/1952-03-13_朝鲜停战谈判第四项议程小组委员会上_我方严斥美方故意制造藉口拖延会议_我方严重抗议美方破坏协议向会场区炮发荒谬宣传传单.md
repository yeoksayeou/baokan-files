Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 12th. At the Fourth Agenda Subcommittee of the Korean Armistice Negotiations on March 12, our side's representatives cited the other side's recent statements to prove that the other side also admitted that there was only one remaining issue in the fourth agenda, namely the principle of repatriation of prisoners of war. However, since March 3rd, the other side suddenly raised the fabricated, unfounded, and groundless issue of the so-called 50,000 opposing prisoners of war now serving in our army, insisting that it was another unresolved dispute. Our side's representatives solemnly pointed out that the so-called issue of 50,000 people is a baseless fabrication that is completely untenable. The other side's deliberate creation of problems can only be interpreted as a delay of the meeting. Our side's representatives further pointed out that the other side's attitude in resolving problems should be to move forward on the basis of existing achievements, rather than stopping or even retreating. Our side's proposal on March 5th pointed out the correct path to be followed by both sides.

At the Third Agenda Staff Meeting, our side once again put forward our reasonable solutions on the issues of neutral nation nominations, rotation and ports, and the authority of neutral nation inspection teams to strictly inspect weapons and ammunition entering Korea, and requested the other side to reconsider and accept them. Translators from both sides continued to proofread the agreed-upon clauses of the armistice agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 12th. This reporter reports: On the 11th, our side's chief liaison officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, sent a letter of protest to the U.S. side's chief liaison officer, Kenney, strongly protesting the U.S. forces' violation of the agreement by firing propaganda leaflets insulting our side into the Panmunjom conference area's eastern edge at 5:30 PM on March 7th. The letter of protest pointed out: On the 8th, our side's conference area security officer conducted an investigation with the U.S. side's security officer. Propaganda leaflets fired by the U.S. side were found at thirty-two locations within the conference area. The U.S. side's behavior in violating the "Agreement between Liaison Officers of Both Sides Regarding the Resumption of Meetings of Both Delegations" demonstrates the U.S. side's rude contempt for the armistice negotiations, as if the U.S. side believes that the location where the two sides are conducting armistice negotiations no longer needs to be given its due respect.

The letter of protest demanded that the U.S. side take responsible action regarding the incident of firing propaganda leaflets and ensure that such violations of the agreement do not occur again.

    朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上
    我方严斥美方故意制造藉口拖延会议
    我方严重抗议美方破坏协议向会场区炮发荒谬宣传传单
    【新华社开城十二日电】三月十二日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程小组委员会上，我方代表历举对方最近的发言，证明对方原来也承认目前在第四项议程中双方只剩下唯一的一个问题，即遣返战俘的原则问题没有解决。但对方自三月三日起突然把他们所一手捏造的无中生有毫无根据的所谓有五万名对方被俘人员现在我方军中服役的问题提出来，硬说是另一个尚未解决的争端。我方代表严正指出那个所谓五万人的问题是毫无根据，完全不能成立的捏造。对方这种故意制造问题，除了是拖延会议外，无法作其他的解释。我方代表进一步指出对方的解决问题的态度，应该是以已有的成就为基础向前推进，而不能停止不进或甚至向后倒退。我方三月五日的提案，指出了双方应走的正确的道路。
    第三项议程参谋会上，我方再次提出我方在中立国提名问题、轮换与口岸问题以及中立国视察小组严格检查进入朝鲜的武器弹药的权力问题上的合理解决方案，要求对方再加考虑，并予接受。双方翻译人员继续就已协议部分的停战协定条款进行文字校正。
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社记者报道：十一日我方首席联络官张春山上校致美方首席联络官肯尼抗议书一件，对三月七日下午五时三十分，美方部队破坏协议向板门店会场区东缘炮发侮蔑我方的宣传传单事提出严重抗议。抗议书指出：八日上午我方会场区安全军官会同美方安全军官进行调查。在会场区内三十二个地点发现美方炮发的宣传传单。美方这种违反“双方联络官间关于双方代表团复会事宜协议”的行为，说明了美方无礼地蔑视停战谈判，好像美方认为双方进行停战谈判的所在地已无须受到它应有的尊重了。
    抗议书要求美方对炮发宣传传单事件作负责的处理，并确实保证这类违反协议的事件不再发生。
