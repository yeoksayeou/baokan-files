    Jinan Grain Company and Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce Shield Profiteers, Harming the Interests of Railway Workers

    To the Editor: In January and February of 1951, our office (formerly the Supply General Store of the Tianjin Railway Bureau) entrusted the Jinan Railway Bureau Supply Store to purchase 54,000 bags of "August 1st" flour from the Jinan Grain Company. After this flour was distributed to employees along the railway line, they all reported that each bag of flour was short of 44 *jin* (about 22 kilograms). At that time, we thought it was a product of a state-owned company and would not be short in weight, so we explained it to the employees through the "Livelihood Committee." Later, as more and more employees complained, we checked the flour in stock and found that each bag of flour was indeed short by four *liang* to one *jin*. We wrote to the Jinan Grain Company and sent people to investigate repeatedly, but the matter was delayed for a long time without resolution. At that time, the company even telephoned to say: The Jinan Administration for Industry and Commerce believes that your reasons for the flour's weight shortage are not very sufficient, and asked us to provide the actual situation and reasons for reference. We immediately wrote again, asking them to send personnel to Tianjin for on-site investigation, but they always delayed and prevaricated, without responding. In May, we purchased another 7,800 bags of flour from the company (processed by the private Huaging Flour Mill). After this batch of flour was distributed to the employees, they again reported that the flour quality was not good. After raising the issue, the Jinan Huaging Flour Mill sent people to Tianjin to investigate and test, confirmed that it was true, and was willing to negotiate a solution through the company. When we purchased the flour, we had direct contact with the Jinan Grain Company. Therefore, we want the company to be responsible to us. However, after repeated negotiations, the company only notified the Jinan Supply Store to inform us that it agreed to compensate 4,000 yuan per bag of flour, and solicited our opinion. We immediately sent someone to Jinan to go through the formalities. Who knew that after arriving in Jinan, the company overturned the previous agreement, using the excuse that "the processing manufacturer does not agree to compensation," and repeatedly delayed the time, prevaricating with an utterly irresponsible attitude. It was not until September of last year that the second batch of flour was compensated for 23.4 million yuan, but the first batch of flour never received reasonable compensation.

    The general lack of weight and poor quality of these two batches of flour can certainly be attributed to the processing manufacturers cheating. But why do the Grain Company and the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce adopt a tolerant and protective attitude towards these profiteers? This is questionable. We hope that the relevant departments will thoroughly investigate the work of the Jinan Grain Company and the Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, and demand that the Jinan Grain Company and the Administration for Industry and Commerce publicly respond in the newspaper.

### 济南市粮食公司和市工商局包庇奸商损害铁路职工利益

    济南市粮食公司和市工商局包庇奸商损害铁路职工利益
    编辑同志：我处（前天津铁路局供给总店）在一九五一年一、二月间，曾委托济南铁路局供给商店由济南市粮食公司购到“八一”粉五万四千袋。这些面粉配发沿线职工后，职工纷纷反映：每袋面粉不足四十四市斤。我处当时以为这是国家公司出品，不会缺秤，因此曾通过“生计委员会”向职工进行了解释。后来职工的意见越来越多，我们于是检查了库存面粉，发现每袋面粉确是短少四两到一斤。我们给济南市粮食公司写信，并派人一再前往调查，但拖延好久，也没有解决。当时该公司并转电话说：济南工商局认为你处所提面粉亏秤问题，理由不很充足，嘱将实际情况及理由提出供参考。我们马上又写信请他们派员来天津实地调查，但他们始终是拖延支吾，不予答复。我们五月份又购该公司面粉七千八百袋（这是私商华庆面粉厂加工的）。这批面粉配发职工后，职工又纷纷反映说，粉质不好。经提出交涉，济南市华庆面粉厂曾派人来天津调查、尝试，确认属实，并情愿通过该公司，协商解决这个问题。我们购买面粉时，是直接和济南市粮食公司发生关系，因此，我们要该公司对我们负责。但经一再交涉，该公司才通知济南供给商店转告我处，同意每袋面粉赔偿四千元，并征求我处意见，我处马上派人前往办理手续。谁知到济南后，该公司竟推翻前议，藉口“加工厂商不同意赔偿”，一再拖延时间，以毫不负责的态度支吾搪塞。直到去年九月，才把第二批面粉赔偿了二千三百四十万元了事，第一批面粉却始终没有得到合理补偿。
    这两批面粉，普遍缺少分量和质量太坏，可以肯定是加工厂商从中捣鬼。但粮食公司和市工商局为什么对这些奸商采取纵容和包庇的态度？这是值得怀疑的。我们希望有关部门彻底检查济南市粮食公司和市工商局的工作，并要求济南市粮食公司和工商局在报纸上公开答复。  天津铁路局职工生活供应处工会委员会
