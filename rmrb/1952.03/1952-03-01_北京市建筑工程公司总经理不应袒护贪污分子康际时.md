    Beijing Construction Engineering Company General Manager Should Not Protect Embezzler Kang Jishi
    Editor: Li Gongxia, the general manager of the Beijing Construction Engineering Company, is protecting the embezzler Kang Jishi and has serious right-leaning ideas. Kang Jishi was the supervisor of the former Taiyuan branch of Beijing Yongmao Construction Engineering Company (now renamed Beijing Construction Engineering Company). During his tenure in Taiyuan, he was used by the big embezzler Liu Lihua, and it is said that his hands were very dirty. He spent more than 120 million yuan decorating a dormitory, where he often danced all night. The masses called this house the "Yongmao Palace." He acted like a bureaucrat to his subordinates, but treated the foremen and private businessmen such as Guan Xiangting exceptionally well. In three months, he spent more than 20 million yuan on eating and drinking with the foremen and private Si Lian Construction Company merchants. In order to please everyone, he used the money the foremen squeezed from the workers to provide extra meals. He once asked his cousin Ding (an officer under Yan Xishan) to solicit housing for the company. Ding violated the policy and bought houses at high prices. During this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he has been resisting all along. He had a close relationship with the big embezzler Liu Lihua. When the masses exposed Liu's embezzlement crimes, he said to the masses, "What do you know?" On January 26, when he was called to study at the company's construction department, he roared to the office staff: "If you find out that I have embezzled, just shoot me. At most, I will just examine my bureaucracy."
    He was unwilling to study. On February 1, at the meeting to struggle against embezzlers, all the personnel again proposed that he should come to study. That night, the company called Li Gongxia and asked for approval for Kang to come to study, but there was no response. After repeated requests from the representatives, Li Gongxia finally approved: "Comrade Kang Jishi, I think you should go to participate in the study." Kang Jishi, after reading this instruction, was indifferent and said to the representatives, "The general manager agrees, but I don't agree. I won't go!" It was not until he learned that someone had written to the newspaper to expose his problems that he hurriedly came to the construction site on February 27 to make a "self-criticism" that did not address the issues, attempting to lightly pass the anti-corruption struggle. This attitude of his has hindered the continued progress of the movement. General Manager Li Gongxia should overcome his right-leaning ideas and immediately investigate Kang Jishi's illegal activities.

    北京市建筑工程公司总经理不应袒护贪污分子康际时
    编辑同志：北京市建筑工程公司总经理李公侠袒护贪污分子康际时，有严重的右倾思想。康际时是前北京市永茂建筑工程公司（现改为北京市建筑工程公司）太原分公司的监理。在太原任内，他为大贪污犯刘礼华所利用，据闻，手面很不干净。他曾花一亿二千多万元修饰一所宿舍，经常在这里彻夜跳舞。群众称这座房子为“永茂皇宫”。他对下耍官僚架子，对管相亭等大把头及私商却优待异常。他在三个月内，请把头及私营四联营造厂商人吃喝花二千余万元。他为了讨好大家，拿把头剥削工人的钱给大家加餐。他曾经叫他的表弟丁某（阎匪锡山属下的军官）给公司拉房纤。丁某违反政策，高价购买房屋。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，他一直采取抵抗态度。他与大贪污犯刘礼华关系甚密，当群众揭露刘的贪污罪行时，他对群众说：“你们懂得什么？”一月二十六日，他被叫到公司施工部学习时，他对办公室的人员咆哮：“查出我有贪污，就枪毙我，我至多不过检查一下官僚主义。”
    他不愿学习。二月一日，在斗争贪污分子大会上，全体人员又提出他应来学习。当夜，公司方面打电话给李公侠，请批准康来学习，但没有下落。经过代表们的再次要求，李公侠才批：“康际时同志，我看你还是去参加学习吧。”康际时看了这个批示，满不在乎，对代表们说：“总经理同意，我不同意，我不去！”直到他知道有人写信给报社揭露他的问题时，他才在二月二十七日匆匆地来工地做了一个不交代问题的“检讨”，企图轻轻地混过反贪污斗争，他这种态度，已阻碍运动的继续前进。总经理李公侠应克服右倾思想，立即检查康际时的不法行为。  程序
