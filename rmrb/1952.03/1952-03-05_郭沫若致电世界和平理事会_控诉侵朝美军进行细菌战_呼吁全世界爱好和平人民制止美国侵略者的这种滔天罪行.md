Xinhua News Agency, March 4th: Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, sent a cable to Mr. Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, on February 25th, accusing the American aggressors of the heinous crime of waging germ warfare in Korea, and calling on peace-loving people around the world to mobilize to stop this massacre and uphold the solemn resolution of the World Peace Congress to ban the use of weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Rafeal, Secretary-General of the World Peace Council, replied on March 1st, stating that he had forwarded Chairman Guo Moruo's accusatory telegram to Chairman Joliot-Curie for publication, and to all members of the World Peace Council and national peace committees. The original telegram and reply are as follows:

To Mr. Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, Prague:

The inhuman American aggressor troops have recklessly and openly launched a large-scale germ warfare in Korea. From January 28th to February 17th of this year, the American aggressor troops have continuously used military aircraft to scatter large quantities of insects containing plague, cholera, typhoid, and other infectious bacteria over the front lines and rear areas of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, attempting to massacre large numbers of peaceful Korean residents and the armed forces of the Chinese and Korean people.

This inhuman and heinous crime has aroused unparalleled anger and indignation among the broad masses of the Chinese and Korean people. It seriously violates the resolution formulated by the Warsaw Conference of the World Congress for the Defense of Peace, representing the will of the people of the world, to ban the use of bacteriological, chemical, and all weapons of mass slaughter, and it also seriously violates all international laws and conventions prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons. Anyone who loves peace, has a modicum of reason, or possesses even a little human sympathy cannot tolerate or stand idly by. I, on behalf of the China Peace Committee, lodge a strong protest against this inhuman and brutal crime of the American aggressors, which seriously violates international law and launches a mad attack on human civilization and justice.

As the world knows, since the end of World War II, the American aggressors have been harboring a large number of Japanese bacteriological war criminals, secretly researching and manufacturing various bacteriological weapons. Recently, they have continuously used captured personnel from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as peaceful Korean residents, as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. Today, while unreasonably obstructing and delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, the American aggressors have openly launched a large-scale germ warfare. This has fully exposed the evil plot of the American aggressors to prolong and expand the Korean War in preparation for launching another world war. Therefore, the heinous crimes of the American aggressors in Korea are not only a massacre of peaceful Korean residents and the armed forces of the Chinese and Korean people, but also a major threat to world peace and the safety of all mankind. Peace-loving people all over the world should recognize that the American aggressors are the most dangerous enemies of world peace and human justice. I firmly believe that this crime of slaughter, which is hostile to world peace and human security, will be resolutely opposed by peace-loving people all over the world and will also suffer a crushing blow from the Chinese and Korean people.

Now, on behalf of the China Peace Committee, I lodge a righteous accusation against this crime of slaughter by the American aggressors to the World Peace Council and peace-loving people all over the world: In order to safeguard world peace and human security, peace-loving people all over the world should mobilize to stop the heinous crime of the American aggressors in waging germ warfare in Korea, and demand that the U.S. government immediately cease its delaying tactics used in the Korean armistice negotiations, so that the armistice negotiations can be successfully concluded. Peace-loving people all over the world will never allow the American aggressors to use bacteriological weapons unscrupulously, expand the Korean War, and undermine world peace. The solemn resolution of the World Congress for the Defense of Peace and the World Peace Council to ban the use of weapons of mass destruction will surely be upheld by the great strength of peace-loving people all over the world.

Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Guo Moruo
Beijing, February 25, 1952

    郭沫若致电世界和平理事会
    控诉侵朝美军进行细菌战
    呼吁全世界爱好和平人民制止美国侵略者的这种滔天罪行
    【新华社四日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若二月二十五日曾致电世界和平理事会约里奥—居里主席，控诉美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战的滔天罪行，呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民动员起来制止这种屠杀罪行，并维护世界保卫和平大会禁止使用大规模杀人武器的庄严决议。世界和平理事会秘书长拉斐德先生三月一日复电，谓已将郭沫若主席控诉电文转交约里奥—居里主席，请他发表，并转交世界和平理事会全体理事及各国和平委员会。原电及复电电文如下：布拉格世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里先生：
    灭绝人性的美国侵略军已在朝鲜不顾一切地公开进行了大规模的细菌战。自本年一月二十八日到二月十七日，美国侵略军竟以军用飞机连续在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的前线阵地和后方大批地撒布各类含有鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒及其他传染病菌的昆虫，企图大量虐杀朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民的武装力量。
    这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行已激起了中朝广大人民无比的愤怒和激动。它严重地破坏了世界保卫和平大会华沙会议代表全世界人民的意志所制定的禁止使用细菌、化学及一切大规模屠杀武器的决议，也严重地破坏了一切禁止使用细菌武器的国际公法和公约。任何爱好和平、稍有理性、稍具人类同情心的人都是绝对不能容忍和坐视的。我代表中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会对美国侵略者这种严重破坏国际公法、向人类文明和正义疯狂进攻的灭绝人性的残暴罪行，提出严重抗议。
    举世周知，第二次大战结束以来，美国侵略者就豢养着大批日本细菌战犯、秘密研究和制造各种细菌武器。最近并曾不断地以朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员及朝鲜和平居民作细菌武器的实验品。今天美国侵略者一面正无理地阻挠和拖延朝鲜停战谈判，一面竟公然发动了大规模的细菌战。这已完全暴露了美国侵略者正企图延长并扩大朝鲜战争，以准备发动另一次世界大战的罪恶阴谋。因此，美国侵略者在朝鲜的滔天罪行已不单是对朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民武装力量的虐杀，它并且是对全世界和平与全人类安全的重大威胁。全世界爱好和平人民应当认清：美国侵略者是世界和平与人类正义的最危险的敌人。我坚决相信这种与世界和平与人类安全为敌的屠杀罪行，必将遭受全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对，亦必将遭受中朝人民粉碎性的打击。
    现在我代表中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会向世界和平理事会和世界爱好和平的人民，对美国侵略者这种屠杀罪行提出正义的控诉：为了维护世界和平与人类的安全，全世界爱好和平的人民应该动员起来，制止美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战的滔天罪行，要求美国政府立即停止其在朝鲜停战谈判中所使用的拖延战术，以便停战谈判能够顺利地达成协议。全世界爱好和平人民绝不容许美国侵略者肆无忌惮地使用细菌武器，扩大朝鲜战争，破坏世界和平。世界保卫和平大会及世界和平理事会的禁止使用大规模杀人武器的庄严决议，必将为世界爱好和平人民的伟大力量所维护。
        中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席    郭沫若
        一九五二年二月二十五日北京
