Regulations on the Establishment of People's Tribunals in the Three-Anti Campaign
(Adopted at the 130th Session of the Government Administration Council on March 28, 1952)

I. In order to handle cases involving the sentencing and exemption from punishment of corrupt elements, as well as other cases that should be handled through judicial procedures, in a serious, prudent, and timely manner during the Three-Anti Campaign, People's Tribunals may be established in organs above the Special District level and in military units above the regimental level to carry out trial work under the leadership of the People's Courts and military judicial organs at the corresponding level. People's Tribunals at all levels and in all units may be established separately by one organ or jointly by several organs, according to actual needs and specific circumstances, and with the approval of the People's Government or military leadership organ at the corresponding level.

In counties where the Three-Anti Campaign is already underway, People's Tribunals may also be established to handle the trial of corrupt elements, according to the circumstances and in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph.

II. Each People's Tribunal should have a Trial Committee, composed of one Presiding Judge, one or two Deputy Presiding Judges, and several Judges, and may also have other staff to assist in the work. The Presiding Judge and Deputy Presiding Judge should generally be the head or deputy head of the organ. The Judges should include active elements from the masses in the Three-Anti Campaign, as well as representatives from various democratic parties and non-party democrats in the organ. The list of candidates should be submitted by the relevant units establishing the People's Tribunal to the People's Government or military leadership organ at the corresponding level for approval, and then formally announced to the masses.

III. Each People's Tribunal has the power to summon, arrest, detain, release, and sentence individuals to control by the organ, labor reform, fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and the death penalty, as well as to declare the recovery of赃款赃物 (ill-gotten gains and stolen goods), confiscation of property, deprivation of political rights, probation, exemption from punishment, and acquittal.

IV. The power to approve criminal punishments generally adopts a system of approval at intervals of one level. The lowest level with this approval power is the Commissioner's Office (or the Provincial People's Government in the absence of a Commissioner's Office) and the division level. Exemption from punishment for life imprisonment and corrupt elements with more than one hundred million yuan in embezzlement should be approved at intervals of two levels. The lowest level with this approval power is the Provincial People's Government and the Second-Level Military Region and Army Corps. All death sentences should be approved by the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council and the Greater Administrative Region People's Government, or the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the Greater Military Region, respectively.

V. If the defendant or plaintiff disagrees with the judgment of a People's Tribunal, they may appeal to the People's Court or military judicial organ at the corresponding level within three days of receiving the judgment.

VI. The judgments of People's Tribunals are executed in accordance with the following provisions:

	A. Those sentenced to control by the organ are generally executed by the organ itself, but may also be sent to an organ designated by the government or military unit;

	B. Those sentenced to labor reform should be sent to an organ designated by the government or military unit;

	C. Those sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment, and the death penalty should be transferred to the local People's Court or military judicial organ for execution;

	D. Those sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment with probation, changed to control by the organ, are executed by the organ itself; those changed to labor reform are handled in accordance with Section B of this article; those sentenced to life imprisonment with probation or the death penalty with probation should be transferred to the local People's Court or military judicial organ for detention and forced labor.

VII. For cases that are particularly complex and crimes that are particularly serious, and that are difficult for People's Tribunals to conclude temporarily, they may be transferred to the People's Court or military judicial organ for trial after being approved by the People's Government or military leadership organ at the corresponding level.

VIII. In order to strengthen leadership over trial work, People's Courts and procuratorial, supervisory, judicial, and public security departments at all levels may jointly form specialized committees to conduct inspections of People's Tribunals at all levels and in all units. Military units will have their political work departments conduct inspections.

IX. People's Tribunals in all units will be abolished by order of the People's Government and military leadership organ at the corresponding level after the end of the Three-Anti Campaign and the completion of the trial tasks.

X. These regulations shall come into effect on the date of promulgation.
