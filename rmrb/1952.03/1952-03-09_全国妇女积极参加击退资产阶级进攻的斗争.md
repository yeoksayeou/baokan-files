Under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and the working class, women across the country have taken a fighting stance and actively participated in the anti-corruption and anti-embezzlement movement, resolutely fighting alongside the people of the whole country to repel the bourgeoisie's frantic attack on the revolutionary camp.

Some regions' leading organs in charge of the entire movement have grasped and implemented the policies of mobilizing both men and women, mobilizing both cadres of organs and family members of cadres, and intensifying education for women. This has led to a significant improvement in women's political awareness, further strengthened women's organizations, deepened their understanding of the People's Government, and further enhanced their love for the motherland. They have become one of the strong forces in encircling and suppressing corrupt elements and illegal capitalists. In particular, they have played a significant role in exposing corrupt elements and persuading criminal family members and relatives to confess.

In the early stages of the movement, women had many concerns. Although most women supported the movement in their hearts, they were afraid that their words would be ineffective and would instead offend people, leading to retaliation; some were afraid that after exposing someone, their husbands, fathers, or brothers would lose their jobs or be punished, harming family relationships. Another part of women felt that they "usually don't manage money, accounts, or affairs, and don't know anything about things inside or outside the home," and didn't believe they could play any role. Therefore, they were indifferent to the movement. There was also a small number of women whose own hands were not clean, or who colluded with family members who had committed crimes, and adopted a resistant attitude towards the movement. In response to these thoughts, democratic women's federations in various regions, in coordination with relevant departments, conducted extensive publicity and education for women, repeatedly publicizing the political significance of the movement and explaining policies through women's mass meetings, women's representative meetings, forums held separately by women from all walks of life, "kang-head" meetings, area meetings, courtyard meetings, door-to-door visits, as well as performances and quick talk shows. They also seized typical examples at any time to carry out enlightenment education. In Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and other places, the publicity for the anti-corruption and anti-embezzlement movement basically reached every household. This kind of publicity and education has raised the political awareness of the broad masses of women, who have stood up in the movement with the posture of masters, exposing and persuading their family members to confess, demonstrating the power of women. In Beijing, the cases exposed by women in each district generally accounted for one-quarter of the total number of exposed cases, with the highest reaching two-thirds. Niu Baozhen, a woman from the Fifth District of Jinan City, mobilized two people to confess their illegal activities, and exposed sixteen corrupt and bribing elements, and also promoted other women to expose five people. In Chongqing, Xi'an, and other places, women's persuasion groups were organized to first explain the policies to women, and then mobilize them to persuade their husbands, fathers, and brothers, which played a significant role. A large number of women activists emerged and were cultivated in the movement. In Beijing, women activists participating in the movement accounted for one-half of the male and female activists in the entire movement, and in some areas it was as high as two-thirds. In Nanchang City, residential women activists undertaking certain tasks in the movement accounted for two-thirds of the total number of women activists. Generally, they enthusiastically looked for materials, found clues, reflected the situation, and actively mobilized others to confess and expose. In many areas, women "checked family income" and "checked the sources of their husbands' money," which formed a trend, breaking the attempts of criminals to establish or maintain a family "alliance of defense." Through the movement, the prestige of the Communist Party and the People's Government has been incomparably enhanced. The people's love and praise for Chairman Mao are simply indescribable. Most women believe that "in the old society, it was a matter of course for officials to be corrupt and businessmen to bribe. Only Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government can completely eradicate these poisonous remnants of the old society."

Some areas have also carried out preliminary democratic reforms of the women's federation organizations through the movement, removing or re-electing cadres and representatives with undemocratic styles or corrupt behavior, and replacing them with activists supported by the masses. Some areas have further eliminated feudal residual ideas and behaviors through the movement. For example, when dealing with problems of corruption, waste, bureaucracy, and illegal capitalists, problems of their violation of the Marriage Law and abuse, killing, or rape of women were also dealt with at the same time. This has played a good role in relieving women's personal suffering, raising women's awareness, and improving their understanding and enthusiasm for the movement.

In terms of the general performance of women participating in the movement, female workers, female students, street working women, female cadres in organs, female employees, and female shop assistants, although they also had some concerns at the beginning, they became active and resolute once they received publicity and education and understood the government's policies. In particular, family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and female party members and female members of the Communist Youth League among these women, became the backbone of the movement. Women in general small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households had more concerns, but after repeated explanations of policies, especially after their relatives were treated leniently by the government, they generally were able to actively support and participate in the movement. Only those family members of capitalists who committed serious crimes shielded their relatives in every possible way and resisted the movement.

At present, the participation of women in the movement is still developing unevenly. First of all, the understanding of women in general areas of this movement and their understanding of the government's policies are not enough. Even in areas where it has basically reached every household, the above-mentioned ideological concerns of women have not been completely broken. Therefore, in the future, continuing to strengthen publicity and education for women in the movement, repeatedly explaining policies at any time and place, and constantly opening up the ideological work of women are still the main and basic tasks. Therefore, the publicity and education work for women in various regions should continue to be strengthened and strive to be deepened.

Secondly, some regions do not pay enough attention to and lead the work of family members of cadres, industrialists, and businessmen. Some ignore these family members and let them drift, so they cannot fully use their power when encircling and suppressing corrupt and embezzling elements. Sometimes, it even becomes an obstacle to the encirclement work. According to the existing experience in family work, all organs and even the organs leading the entire movement in various regions must allocate a certain amount of force to specialize in this work, and designate special personnel or special organs to regularly guide this work, exchange experiences, and deal with problems in a timely manner.

Thirdly, the work of clearly dividing the ideological boundaries between the bourgeoisie and the working class among the working women masses has not yet explored certain experiences, and some regions have not yet seen the importance of this work. In order to consolidate the achievements that women have already gained in the anti-corruption and anti-embezzlement movement, and in order to further enable working women to become a broad social force to eliminate bourgeois ideology and transform social customs, the organs leading the entire movement in various regions, especially the democratic women's federations at all levels, should quickly accumulate experience in this area, study and promote it.

    全国妇女积极参加击退资产阶级进攻的斗争
    加林
    各地妇女群众在中国共产党和工人阶级的领导与教育下，以战斗的姿态，积极地参加了反贪污、反盗窃的运动，坚决和全国人民一道，为击退资产阶级向革命阵营的猖狂进攻而斗争。
    有些地区领导整个运动的负责机关，掌握了和执行了男女一齐发动，机关干部和干部家属一齐发动以及对妇女加一把力进行教育的方针，使妇女在运动中，政治觉悟有了显著的提高，妇女组织有了进一步的加强，对人民政府有了进一步的认识，对祖国的热爱也进一步加深了。她们已成为围剿贪污分子和违法资本家的坚强队伍之一。特别在检举贪污分子和规劝犯罪家属和亲友坦白方面，起了重大的作用。
    运动初期，妇女群众的顾虑很多。多数妇女虽然心里拥护这个运动，但怕说了不顶事，反而得罪人，以后遭受报复；有的怕检举以后，自己的丈夫、父兄要失业或受处罚，怕伤亲属感情。另一部分妇女觉得自己“平时不管钱，不管账，不管事，家内家外的事情都不知道”，也不相信自己能起什么作用。因而对运动漠不关心。还有一小部分妇女自己手上不干净，或者和犯有罪行的家属狼狈为奸，而对运动采取抗拒态度。针对这些思想，各地民主妇女联合会配合有关方面，对妇女群众进行了广泛的宣传教育，通过妇女群众会、妇女代表会、各界妇女分别召开的座谈会、炕头会、片会、院会、串门走访以及演戏、说快板等方式，反复宣传运动的政治意义，交代政策。并随时抓住典型事例来进行启发教育。北京、天津、沈阳等地，反贪污、反盗窃运动的宣传基本上做到了家喻户晓。这种宣传教育，使广大妇女群众提高了政治觉悟，以主人翁的姿态站到运动中来，检举和规劝家属坦白，表现了妇女的力量。北京市各区妇女检举的案件，一般占检举案件总数的四分之一，最高的达三分之二。济南市第五区妇女牛宝珍，动员两个人坦白了违法行为，并检举了十六个贪污、行贿分子，还推动其他妇女检举了五人。重庆、西安等地组织了妇女规劝小组，首先向妇女交代政策，然后再动员她们去规劝丈夫、父兄，起了很大作用。运动中涌现出和培养了大批的妇女积极分子。北京市参加运动的妇女积极分子，占整个运动中男女积极分子的二分之一，个别地段高达三分之二。南昌市居民妇女积极分子在运动中担负一定工作的，占全体妇女积极分子总数的三分之二。她们一般的都热心地找材料，找线索，反映情况，积极动员别人坦白和检举。很多地区，妇女“检查家里的收入”，“检查丈夫的来钱路”，形成了风气，打破了犯罪分子企图订立或坚守家庭“攻守同盟”的企图。通过运动，共产党和人民政府的威信是无比地增高了。人民对毛主席的爱戴和歌颂，简直难以形容。一般妇女认为：“在旧社会里做官的人贪污、做生意的人行贿，是天经地义的事，只有毛主席、共产党、人民政府才能把这些旧社会遗留下的污毒彻底铲除干净”。
    有些地区通过运动，还初步进行了妇联组织的民主改革，把作风不民主，或有贪污行为的干部、代表，加以撤职或改选，代之以为群众所拥护的积极分子。有些地区通过运动，进一步扫除了封建残余思想和行为。如在处理贪污、浪费、官僚主义分子及违法资本家的问题时，对他们违犯婚姻法及虐待、杀害或强奸妇女的问题，也同时加以处理。这样，对于解除妇女切身痛苦、提高妇女的觉悟、提高她们对运动的认识和积极性方面，起了很好的作用。
    从妇女参加运动中的一般表现来说，女工、女学生、街道劳动妇女、机关女干部、女职员、女店员，开始时虽然也有些顾虑，但一经宣传教育，知道了政府政策以后，就表现得积极、坚决。特别是这些妇女中的烈军工属和女党员、女青年团员，更成为运动中的骨干分子。一般中、小工商户中的妇女则顾虑较多，但经过反复交代政策，特别是她们的亲属受到政府的宽大处理以后，一般的也能积极拥护运动、参加运动。只有那些犯有严重罪行的资本家家属，才多方包庇亲属，抗拒运动。
    目前妇女参加运动的情况，还发展得不平衡。首先表现在，一般地区的妇女群众对这个运动的认识和对政府的政策的了解还不够，即使在基本上做到了家喻户晓的地区，也还没有完全打破妇女群众的上述思想顾虑。为此，今后在运动中继续加强对妇女的宣传教育，随时随地反复交代政策，不断地打通妇女群众思想的工作，仍是主要的、基本的。因此，各地对妇女群众的宣传教育工作，还应继续加强和力求深入。
    其次，有些地区对机关干部、工商业者的家属工作重视和领导不够。有的对这些家属不闻不问，任其自流，因此也不能在围剿贪污盗窃分子时充分地运用上她们的力量。甚至有时竟成为围剿工作中的障碍，根据已有的家属工作经验，各机关乃至各地领导整个运动的机关，必须分配一定的力量专门进行这一工作，并指定专人或专门机关经常指导这一工作，交流经验，及时处理问题。
    第三，在劳动妇女群众中明确地划分资产阶级和工人阶级的思想界限的工作，目前还没有摸索出一定的经验，有的地区还没有看到这个工作的重要性。为了巩固妇女在反贪污、反盗窃运动中已获得的成绩，为了使劳动妇女进一步成为清除资产阶级思想、转移社会风气的广泛的社会力量，各地领导整个运动的机关，特别是各级民主妇女联合会，应迅速积累这方面的经验，加以研究和推广。
