Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th. Our front-line reporter reports: The U.S. aggressors' increasingly intensified and arrogant provocative act of expanding germ warfare to the territory of the motherland has aroused even greater anger among the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. When the frontline gazette carrying the news of the enemy spreading bacteria in Andong, Fushun, and other places and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement of March 8th was distributed to a certain unit, the soldiers were all infuriated, clenching their fists and seething with rage. Wang Faqing, the political instructor of a certain company, said excitedly to the soldiers gathered around him: "Comrades, now the evil U.S. aggressors dare to blatantly spread murderous bacteria and insects into our motherland! This is the enemy's most barbaric and brutal provocative act. We must resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and demand severe punishment for the American war criminals who spread bacteria. We should even more fiercely attack the enemy in front of us to avenge the motherland and the Korean people!" Ma Fa, a soldier and meritorious hero of a certain company, said: "The American murderers dare to commit such heinous crimes, and they will never escape the severe punishment of peace-loving people all over the world!" Many soldiers whose homes are in the Northeast gnashed their teeth and said, "A blood debt must be paid with blood, and we will never stop until we eliminate the enemy!" Platoon Leader Li Wanfa warned the U.S. aggressors: "The Chinese people cannot be intimidated and must not be provoked. If you dare to continue down this path to destruction, you will die even faster!"

The soldiers of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit, after hearing the news, angrily and vigorously wiped the gun barrels and shells. They vowed not to let go of a single war criminal and to shoot down those murderers who spread bacteria one by one!

Tan Bingyun, a Volunteer Army combat hero, National Day observation delegate, and anti-tank hero, who recently returned to the Korean front, said: "We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. In order to defend the safety of the motherland and the world's righteous people, we will fight to the end with the brutal and shameless American murderers!" Che Shuqin, a model medical worker, said: "The extreme and heinous barbaric behavior of the United States is an attempt to expand the war of aggression and drag the whole world into the disaster of war. Peace-loving people all over the world should immediately mobilize to stop this crazy crime of the U.S. aggressors. We medical workers must stand at the forefront of the anti-bacterial warfare and resolutely eliminate the bacteria spread by the U.S. military to protect the health of soldiers and people." Zhou Wenjiang, a combat hero who represented the Volunteer Army at the Third World Youth and Student Peace Festival in Berlin, said: "This despicable and vicious crime of U.S. imperialism, which blatantly violates international law and human morality, further exposes it as the deadly enemy of all mankind; it will inevitably be justly punished by the people of the world and accelerate its final demise."

    愤怒抗议美军在我东北撒布细菌
    决心加紧打击敌人为祖国和朝鲜人民报仇雪恨
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】本社前线记者报道：美国侵略者变本加厉地把细菌战扩大到祖国领土的狂妄挑衅行为，在志愿军指挥员战斗员中激起了更大的愤怒。当刊登着敌人在安东、抚顺等地撒布细菌的消息和周恩来外长三月八日声明的火线小报传送到某部时，战士们个个气得磨拳擦掌，热血沸腾。某连政治指导员王法庆激动地对围集在他身边的战士们说：“同志们，现在万恶的美国侵略者竟敢明目张胆地把杀人的细菌毒虫撒到我们祖国去了！这是敌人最野蛮最残暴的挑衅行为。我们要坚决拥护周外长的声明，要求严厉惩办撒布细菌的美国战争罪犯；我们更应该狠狠地打击当面的敌人，为祖国和朝鲜人民报仇雪恨！”某连战士大功功臣马法说：“美国杀人凶犯胆敢干出这样的滔天罪行，它决逃不掉全世界爱好和平人民的严厉惩罚！”许多家在东北的战士更咬牙切齿地说：“血债一定要用血来还，不消灭仇敌不罢休！”排长李万发警告美国侵略者说：“中国人民是吓不倒的，惹不得的；你们要是敢继续这样往死路上走，你们就会死亡得更快一些！”
    某高射炮部队的战士们听到这个消息后，愤怒地使劲擦拭炮筒与炮弹。他们立誓不放走一个战争罪犯，要把那些撒布细菌的凶手们一个个都打下来！
    最近返抵朝鲜前线的志愿军战斗英雄国庆节观礼代表、反战车英雄谭秉云说：“我们坚决拥护周外长的声明，为了保卫祖国和世界正义人民的安全，要和残暴无耻的美国杀人凶犯战斗到底！”模范医务工作者车书琴说：“美国这种穷凶极恶的野蛮行为，是企图扩大侵略战争，把全世界拖进战争的灾难中去。全世界爱好和平的人民应当立即动员起来，制止美国侵略者这种疯狂的罪行。我们医务工作者要站在反细菌战的最前线，坚决扑灭美军撒布的细菌，保护战士和人民的健康。”曾代表志愿军参加柏林第三届世界青年与学生和平联欢节的战斗英雄周文江说：“美帝国主义这种公然违反国际公法和人类道义的卑鄙恶毒的罪行，更加暴露了它是全人类的死敌；它必然会遭到全世界人民的正义惩罚而加速其最后灭亡。”
