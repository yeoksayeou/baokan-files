    The Entire World is Threatened by American Aggressors
    Jiāsīgài
    Our investigation team has been to most parts of North Korea, and everywhere we saw the ruins of cities reduced to ashes. Many buildings protected by international agreements—hospitals, churches, and schools with Red Cross markings—were also bombed by American planes. Many villages were similarly destroyed.
    We have questioned many witnesses who have witnessed the crimes committed by American troops during their occupation or retreat. They recounted many shocking murders to us. We have learned that in several areas, some residents were systematically massacred under the direction of responsible American military officers.
    All these facts violate not only international law but also the conscience of all mankind.
    After returning to France, I will not only report these facts to progressive men and women but also to all honest people who have been deceived by reactionary newspapers serving the United States. I will demand that the people of my country exert pressure on our government to immediately cease participating in these crimes.
    During my stay in Korea, I saw with horror the consequences of the entire war, and the entire world is now threatened by the war of the American aggressors.

    整个世界遭受着美国侵略者的威胁
    贾斯盖
    我们调查团到过北朝鲜的大部分地区，我们到处看见化为灰烬的城市废墟。许多受国际协定保护的建筑物——具有红十字标志的医院、教堂、学校，也被美国飞机炸毁了。许许多多乡村也同样被毁灭了。
    我们询问过许多曾经目睹美国军队在占领期内或撤退时所犯罪行的证人。他们向我们叙述了很多骇人听闻的杀人事实。我们曾获悉，在几个地区，一部分居民是在美军负责军官的指使下被有计划地屠杀的。
    所有这些事实，不仅违反了国际公法，而且违反了全人类的良心。
    我回到法国后，不仅要把这些事实向进步的男女们报告，而且也要对那些被服务于美国的反动报纸所欺骗的一切诚实人民进行报道。我将要求我国人民对于我国的政府施用压力，使我国政府立刻停止参与这些犯罪的事。
    我逗留朝鲜期间，我以惊恐的心情看见了整个战争的后果，整个世界今天已遭受到美国侵略者的战争威胁。
