Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: The British government, the number one accomplice of the invading American army in Korea, continues to shamelessly and frantically parrot Acheson's words, desperately trying to cover up America's heinous crimes of conducting germ warfare. This despicable, vile, and foolish act of the British government, besides further clarifying that it is Wall Street's obedient lackey, also confirms that the British government is the primary accomplice of the United States in conducting germ warfare.

According to British Information Services, on the 25th, British Foreign Secretary Eden said in the British Parliament regarding America's germ warfare in Korea: "Mr. Acheson suggested that an international organization like the International Committee of the Red Cross conduct an investigation to seek the truth." Then Eden wagged his tail at his master Acheson and said: "The British government believes that this is a very fair and appropriate proposal, and we wholeheartedly support it." Here, Eden played another trick of asking the murderer to act as a witness himself. He said: "Mr. Acheson has clearly denied these completely unfounded and false accusations." The British government seems to know that the International Committee of the Red Cross, in order to cover up the atrocities of its American master in Korea, has long stipulated that it has no right to conduct this type of investigation. Obviously, this fig leaf can no longer cover up Acheson's ugly behavior; therefore, the British government cannot help but play another trick. On the evening of the 25th, a spokesman for the same British Foreign Office issued a statement saying that the British government welcomes the World Health Organization's suggestion to go to North Korea to "prevent and control" infectious diseases. But the hole in this fig leaf is no smaller than the previous one. Just imagine: the United Nations World Health Organization, also controlled by American bandits, goes to "prevent and control" the epidemics spread by the United Nations forces under the control of American bandits in Korea. Isn't this absurd to the extreme! Therefore, it is very clear that this so-called World Health Organization attempts to sneak into North Korea under the guise of "preventing and controlling" infectious diseases, obviously to achieve the despicable purpose of collecting intelligence on its germ warfare for the American aggressors. Can there be any other explanation for this?

Since these two fig leaves cannot cover up the shameless faces of Acheson and Eden, the British Foreign Office simply closed its eyes and spread lies. According to an AFP dispatch from London on the 26th: "The British Foreign Office today flatly denied the Communist accusations that United Nations doctors were conducting inhumane medical experiments on Communist prisoners of war." In order to eagerly shirk responsibility for its American master, the British Foreign Office rashly slapped its American master in the face. The hypocrites in the British Foreign Office originally remembered the words and deeds of their American masters so well that they could flatter and echo them at any time, but they frantically forgot them. These hypocrites were obviously too alarmed and forgot to flip through the newspapers to see a news report by the Associated Press on May 18, 1951. This news said that United Nations doctors on Infantry Landing Craft 1091 "obtained oral and rectal cultures from patients in prisoner-of-war camps all over Geoje Island, conducting about three thousand tests every day." The American "Newsweek" published on April 9, 1951, also talked about the fact that this ship used Chinese people for experiments outside Wonsan Port. The British government, faced with these bloody facts, shamelessly wants to erase them with a single stroke. It is really arrogant and shameless to the extreme. This also shows how panicked it is, so that it can only speak incoherently and talk nonsense.

People cannot help but wonder, why is the British government so panicked and confused? In fact, there is nothing strange about this. As long as you briefly review the criminal records related to germ warfare, people will find that the British government is the primary accomplice of the United States in conducting germ warfare!

An article in the American reactionary magazine "Reader's Digest" in August 1946, entitled "The Deadliest War," stated that as early as December 1943, "the British and American sides began research on germ warfare." The article also stated that "the biological warfare experiments carried out by the United States" were "conducted secretly" with "Britain and Canada" during World War II. "Reader's Digest" reported in January 1951 that one of the largest bases for researching germ warfare in the British Commonwealth was the "Chemical Warfare Laboratory" near Suffield, Alberta, Canada. Many American "scientists" were participating in the work of this unspeakable "laboratory" during the war.

After the end of the war, the crimes of the United States, Britain, and Canada colluding with each other to research and prepare for germ warfare did not stop, but continued to develop. The British government also established a new germ warfare research organization in Porton, Salisbury Plain, called the "Biological Research Department." In an article discussing germ warfare published in the December 1950 issue of the British magazine "Discovery," British scientist Pincher quoted an official British report from 1947, revealing the details of the organization manufacturing pneumonic plague. According to Pincher, the Porton Institute is "the largest scientific institution in Britain." In order to expand the work of the "Chemical Warfare Laboratory" in Suffield, Canada, the authorities added sixty British and Canadian "graduate students" in January 1950. From March 15th to 17th of the same year, American, British, and Canadian "scientists" held "secret negotiations on chemical and germ warfare" in Ottawa, Canada. "The negotiations were due to the defense ministers of the three countries hoping to exchange scientific intelligence so that the three countries could benefit from any new discoveries" (AFP Ottawa, March 16, 1950).

After the outbreak of the war of aggression against Korea, the British government, under the direction of the United States, stepped up its research and preparation for germ warfare. On July 26, 1950, the then British Defense Minister Shinwell submitted a plan to the Lower House to increase the allocation of about 100 million pounds to implement a plan to strengthen domestic preparations. One of the key points of the plan was: "Strengthening the research on weapons of mass destruction, missiles, germ warfare, and chemical warfare" (United Press London, July 26, 1950). British scientists also directly participated in the criminal work of manufacturing germ weapons in the United States. The aforementioned British scientist Pincher admitted in the same article that British scientists are working with American biologists at the American germ warfare research center, Camp Detrick. Recently, the Anglo-Chinese Friendship Association's statement protesting against American germ warfare also revealed that Henderson, the director of the British germ warfare research office, visited the United States last year and personally witnessed the large-scale preparations for germ warfare in the United States.

All of the above facts revealed by the United States, France, and even Britain's own magazines and news agencies undeniably show that Britain is an accomplice in American germ warfare. From these facts, people can fully understand: why the British government should follow Acheson in lying and acting like a rascal like an echo; why the British government has never dared to say a word condemning germ warfare until now.

The crime of the American aggressors conducting heinous germ warfare has been firmly established, and any tricks of the American bandits cannot cover it up. And the British government's echoing behavior is not only equally useless, but on the contrary, it exposes the ugly face of the British government as an accomplice to the world. The American war criminals who dare to conduct inhumane germ warfare will inevitably be subject to just sanctions by the people of the world, and the British government, which acts as an accomplice, will inevitably not escape the responsibility it should bear.

### 艾登厚颜无耻掩饰美国滔天罪行  证明英政府是美国细菌战同谋犯  主犯和帮凶都将受到世界人民的正义制裁

    艾登厚颜无耻掩饰美国滔天罪行
    证明英政府是美国细菌战同谋犯
    主犯和帮凶都将受到世界人民的正义制裁
    【新华社二十七日讯】侵朝美军的头号帮凶英国政府，继续厚颜无耻和慌乱地学着艾奇逊的舌头，竭力掩饰美国进行细菌战的滔天罪行。英国政府这种卑鄙下流而又愚蠢的行径，除了更清楚地说明它是华尔街的唯命是从的小伙计而外，同时也证实了英国政府正是美国进行细菌战的首要同谋犯。
    据英国新闻处的消息，二十五日，英国外交大臣艾登在英国议会里说：关于美国在朝鲜进行细菌战，“艾奇逊先生建议由红十字国际委员会之类的国际机构进行调查，以求得事实真相”。接着艾登就向他的艾奇逊老爷摇着尾巴说：“英国政府认为，这是非常公道和恰当的建议，我们衷心地表示拥护。”艾登在这里又耍了一套请杀人犯自己来充当见证人的流氓把戏，他说：“艾奇逊先生已经明确地否认了这些完全没有根据和虚假的指责。”英国政府似乎自己也知道红十字国际委员会为了替它的美国主子掩盖在朝鲜的暴行，早就规定了自己无权进行这一类调查，显然用这块遮羞布已经掩盖不住艾奇逊的丑态；因此英国政府就不能不耍起另一支花枪。在二十五日晚上，同一个英国外交部的一个发言人发表谈话说：英国政府欢迎世界卫生组织到朝鲜北部去“防治”传染病的建议。可是这块遮羞布上的破洞并不比上一块小些。试想：同样由美国强盗控制之下的联合国世界卫生组织，去“防治”美国强盗控制之下的联合国军在朝鲜散播的疫病，岂不是荒唐到绝顶的胡说八道！因此，事情已经十分明白，这个所谓世界卫生组织企图以“防治”传染病为名而钻进朝鲜北部，显然是要达到替美国侵略者搜集它的细菌战情报的卑鄙目的，这难道还能作任何别的解释吗？
    既然这两块遮羞布都遮不住艾奇逊和艾登的无耻嘴脸，英国外交部就索性闭起眼睛撒起漫天大谎来了。据法新社伦敦二十六日电称：“英国外交部今天断然否认共产党提出的联合国医生对共产党战俘进行不人道的医学实验的指责。”英国外交部为了急于替他的美国老爷推卸责任，竟十分冒失地打了他的美国老爷一记清脆的耳光。英国外交部的那些伪君子们原来是把美国主子们的言行记得烂熟以便随时捧场附和的，可是他们却慌乱地把它忘记了。这些伪君子们显然过度惊张而忘记去翻一翻报纸，看看美联社在一九五一年五月十八日报道的一篇新闻。这篇新闻说，在一○九一号步兵登陆艇上的联合国医生们，“从巨济岛各处的战俘营的病人取得口腔和直肠培养物，每天进行大约三千次试验”。一九五一年四月九日出版的美国的“新闻周刊”也谈到了这艘船在元山港外用中国人做实验的事实。英国政府对于这些血淋淋的事实，竟然厚着脸皮想一笔抹杀，实在是狂妄和无耻到了极点。这也说明了它是如何惊慌失措，以至只能语无伦次，满口胡扯了。
    人们不能不奇怪，为什么英国政府会惊慌失措到这样昏头昏脑的地步呢？其实这并没有什么奇怪，只要略为查阅一下有关细菌战的罪恶纪录，人们就会发现：原来英国政府正是美国进行细菌战的首要同谋犯！
    美国反动杂志“读者文摘”一九四六年八月号曾刊载一篇题为“最致命的战争”的文章说：早在一九四三年十二月，“英美方面就开始了细菌战的研究”。该文章又说：“美国所施行的生物战争的实验”是在第二次大战期间“与英国和加拿大”“秘密进行”的。“读者文摘”在一九五一年一月曾经报道说，英联邦境内的研究细菌战的最大的基地之一就是设在加拿大阿尔培达省萨菲尔德附近的“化学战争实验室”。这个不可告人的“实验室”在大战期间就有许多美国“科学家”在参加工作了。
    大战结束以后，美、英、加三国相互勾结研究和准备细菌战的罪行并未停止，而且在继续发展。英国政府并在萨里斯柏雷平原的波顿地方建立了一个新的细菌战研究组织，名叫“生物学研究部”。英国科学家宾乔在一九五○年十二月号的“发现”杂志上发表的一篇论述细菌战的文章中，引述了英国官方一九四七年的一个报告，透露出制造肺鼠疫的机构的详情。据宾乔说：波顿研究所是“英国最大规模的科学机构”。为了扩大在加拿大的萨菲尔德
    “化学战争实验室”的工作，有关当局在一九五○年一月间增加了六十个英国籍和加拿大籍的“研究生”。同年三月十五日到十七日，美、英、加三国
    “科学家”在加拿大渥太华举行了“关于化学及细菌战争的秘密谈判”。“谈判是由于三国的国防部长希望交换科学的情报，借以使三国能够因任何新发现而获益”（法新社渥太华一九五○年三月十六日电）。
    侵朝战争爆发后，英国政府在美国的指使之下，加紧了对细菌战的研究和准备工作。一九五○年七月二十六日，当时的英国国防大臣辛威尔向下院提出了增拨约一亿镑以实行加强国内准备方案的计划。计划的要点之一就是：“加强研究大规模毁灭武器、飞弹、细菌战及化学战”（合众社伦敦一九五○年七月二十六日电）。英国科学家并直接参加美国的制造细菌武器的罪恶工作。上述英国科学家宾乔在同一篇文章中承认：英国科学家正在美国细菌战研究中心狄特里克营和美国生物学家一起工作。最近，英中友好协会发表的抗议美国进行细菌战的声明也揭露：英国细菌战研究处处长亨德逊曾在去年访问过美国，并亲眼看到美国大规模准备细菌战的活动。
    所有上面这一切由美国、法国以至英国自己的杂志和通讯社所透露出来的事实，无可置辩地说明了英国是美国进行细菌战的同谋犯。从这些事实里，人们就可以完全理解：为什么英国政府要像应声虫
    一样跟着艾奇逊撒谎耍无赖；为什么英国政府直到现在始终不敢说一句谴责细菌战的话。
    美国侵略者进行万恶的细菌战的罪行已铁案如山，美国强盗的任何鬼蜮伎俩都是掩盖不了的。而英国政府的帮腔行为不但同样无济于事，相反地却向世界暴露了英国政府帮凶者的丑恶嘴脸。胆敢进行无人道的细菌战的美国战争罪犯们，必将受到全世界人民的正义制裁，充当同谋犯的英国政府也必然逃脱不了它应负的责任。
