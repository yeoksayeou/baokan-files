    Shijingshan Steel Plant
    Investigating and Disciplining Embezzlers in the Construction Procurement Section's Projects

    Editor: We sincerely accept the readers' criticism of our plant's procurement section's projects published in the People's Daily on March 16th.

    In the past, the plant leadership had serious bureaucratic work styles, excessively trusting some cadres in the capital construction department and lacking supervision of the work. This led to unscrupulous merchants cutting corners and reducing materials, causing significant losses to the state. During the anti-corruption movement, we have conducted inspections of the project's quality, contracts, and accounts, and have also dispatched civil engineer Zhao Guangwei to participate in the Beijing Municipal Savings Inspection Committee's inspection team at Fulong Construction Company, providing them with the materials we have discovered. We have already dismissed the former head of the capital construction department, the chief engineer in charge of the construction procurement section's projects, and the supervisors who were major embezzlers, placing them under in-plant review; the chief engineer has also confessed to accepting bribes of 30 million yuan. We are continuing to investigate related issues concerning this project.

    Ma Kaixu, a staff member of our plant's supply section, did not earnestly and responsibly report the inspection team's opinions to us, and we have severely criticized him.

    Shijingshan Steel Plant Savings Inspection Committee

### 石景山钢铁厂  检查修建采购课工程的贪污分子

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    石景山钢铁厂
    检查修建采购课工程的贪污分子
    编辑同志：人民日报三月十六日刊载的读者对我厂采购课工程的批评，我们诚恳地接受。
    过去我厂领导方面有严重的官僚主义作风，过分相信了基本建设处的一些干部，对工作缺乏检查，致奸商偷工减料，使国家遭受了很大的损失。在反贪污运动中，我们对该工程的质量、合同、账目等已作了检查，并派土木工程师赵光维参加北京市节约检查委员会福隆营造厂检查组，把我处已发现的材料供给他们。我们已将前基本建设处处长、修建采购课工程主管工程师与监工人员等大贪污犯撤职，留厂反省；该主管工程师并已坦白受贿三千万元。现在，我们仍在继续调查有关这一工程的问题。
    我厂供应课职员马开绪，没有把检查组的意见认真而负责地向我们反映，我们已对他提出严厉的批评。
    石景山钢铁厂节约检查委员会
