Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: According to TASS, Pyongyang, March 6th: The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party has passed a resolution on "March 8th" International Women's Day. The resolution states: All the Korean people are commemorating the international day of friendship for peace-loving world democratic women during the patriotic liberation war to win the independence, freedom, and glory of the fatherland, and to oppose the Anglo-American aggressors and their running dogs.

The resolution points out: On the front lines, in the rear areas, and in the enemy-occupied zones, Korean women have demonstrated unparalleled patriotism, selflessness, heroism, and perseverance. Six Korean women have been awarded the title of Hero of the People's Republic of Korea, and more than six thousand women have received medals and awards. Today's Korean women are no longer the women who were recently subjected to feudal, colonial oppression and exploitation.

The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party recommends that all Party organizations universally commemorate International Women's Day under the slogan of strengthening the struggle at the front and in the rear, and striving for victory in the patriotic liberation war.

The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party calls on all women to take over the work of those who have gone to the front, achieve even more glorious achievements in the cause of defending their beloved fatherland and families, and further strive to support the front lines and consolidate the rear areas.

The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party also calls on all women of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to strengthen their unity and ties with democratic women around the world who are fighting for lasting world peace and security, and to unite more closely around the Workers' Party, the People's Government, and General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 7th: Park Chung-ae, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League, wrote an article entitled "The Friendship and Solidarity Between Chinese and Korean Women Forged in the Joint Struggle Against American Aggressors" to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day.

Park Chung-ae wrote: In the two world wars, many women lost their husbands and sons. While the pain they suffered is still fresh in their minds, they are again faced with the threat of war due to the frantic arms race of the American and British warmongers. Especially the women of our two countries, Korea and China, because our common enemy, the American aggressors, launched the war of aggression against Korea, we have sent our sons and husbands to the front lines.

Park Chung-ae then pointed out: The purpose of the American imperialists in launching the war of aggression against Korea is to make the Korean people their slaves and to make Korean territory their base for attacking the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. At the beginning of the serious situation facing my country, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, under the banner of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Defend the Home, Defend the Country," formed the Volunteers and came to the Korean front lines to resist the American aggressors. The fighting friendship between the peoples of Korea and China in jointly resisting aggression has a long historical tradition. Today, the peoples of the two countries are united even more firmly. In the just struggle to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of their homelands, as well as to defend world peace and security, the women of Korea and China consciously and fully exert their potential strength and unite with comradely love and kinship.

Chinese women support the just war of liberation of the fatherland of Korean women and the Korean people with heartfelt encouragement and a large amount of material assistance, and unhesitatingly send their sons and husbands directly to the Korean front lines to support us. Korean women feel supremely proud of this noble friendship and support, and their confidence in victory is further enhanced because hundreds of millions of Chinese sisters are fighting alongside them.

The Korean people will never forget the great achievements made by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the just war to defend our country. Korean women who have sent their sons and husbands to the front lines support the Chinese People's Volunteers as if they were supporting their own relatives, and do everything they can to help and care for them.

Park Chung-ae pointed out: The flesh-and-blood friendship and solidarity between the women and all the people of Korea and China in the just war of jointly resisting the American aggressors and their running dogs cannot be destroyed by any imperialist aggressor forces. The basis of this consolidated friendship and solidarity is the patriotism and internationalism of the women of Korea and China. Under the people's democratic system, the women of Korea and China, who have long groaned under the oppression of feudalism and imperialism, have been freed from their miserable lives and have been guaranteed the same rights and freedoms as men in all aspects of politics, economy, society, and culture. They are determined to defend their people's democratic states. At the same time, in order to stop the American and British warmongers from attempting to create a new war, they stand at the forefront of the struggle against aggression and in defense of peace, and take on the responsibility of crushing the American aggressors' conspiracy to expand the war on the Korean battlefield in front of all the mothers and children of the world.

Park Chung-ae concluded by saying: Today, peace-loving women and kind people all over the world are widely supporting our just struggle and expect us to achieve victory. The American imperialist beasts, which have suffered a crushing defeat militarily and politically, disregard international laws and human morality concerning war and use bacteriological weapons in an inhumane manner. However, any atrocities committed by the American imperialist beasts will be bankrupted in the face of the great solidarity and strength of the peoples and women of Korea and China. We believe that the final glorious victory will surely belong to the peoples and women of Korea and China. In order to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of our homelands, to defend world peace and security, the rights of women, and the happy future of children, let us further strengthen and consolidate the friendship and solidarity between the women of Korea and China!

    朝鲜劳动党中央通过“三八”国际妇女节的决议
    号召朝鲜妇女更进一步支援前线保卫祖国
    朴正爱著文赞扬中朝妇女密切团结共同反抗美国侵略者
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社平壤六日讯：朝鲜劳动党中央委员会通过关于“三八”国际妇女节的决议。决议称：朝鲜全体人民是在争取祖国的独立自由与光荣、反对美英侵略者及其走狗的爱国解放战争中，来纪念爱好和平的世界民主妇女国际友爱的节日的。
    决议指出：在前线、后方和敌占区，朝鲜妇女都表现了无比的爱国主义的忘我精神、英雄气概和坚忍不拔的精神。六个朝鲜妇女荣获朝鲜人民共和国英雄的称号，六千多个妇女得到勋章和奖章。今天的朝鲜妇女不再是不久前还遭受封建主义、殖民主义压迫和剥削的妇女了。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会建议所有党组织在加强前线和后方的斗争的口号下，为争取爱国解放战争的胜利而普遍纪念国际妇女节。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会号召所有妇女接下到前线去的人的工作，在保卫她们的亲爱的祖国和家庭的事业中，取得更加光辉的成就，进一步努力支援前线和巩固后方。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会并号召朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的所有妇女，加强与正在为争取世界持久和平与安全而斗争的全世界民主妇女的团结和联系，并更加紧密地团结在劳动党、人民政府和朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军的周围。
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜民主妇女同盟中央委员会委员长朴正爱以“朝中两国妇女在共同反抗美国侵略者的斗争中结成的友谊团结”为题，撰文纪念“三八”国际妇女节。
    朴正爱写道：在两次世界大战中，许多妇女丧失了丈夫和儿子。当她们身受的创痛记忆犹新的时候，由于美、英战争贩子的疯狂备战，她们又面临着战争的威胁。特别是我们朝中两国的妇女，由于我们的共同敌人美国侵略者发动了侵朝战争，我们已把自己的儿子和丈夫送往前线。
    朴正爱接着指出：美帝国主义发动侵朝战争的目的，是想使朝鲜人民成为它的奴隶，使朝鲜领土成为它进攻伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国的基地。当我祖国面临严重局势的开头，中国人民的优秀儿女在“抗美援朝保家卫国”的旗帜下，组成志愿军，到朝鲜前线来抗击美国侵略者。朝中两国人民并肩反侵略的战斗友谊是有长期的历史传统的。今天，两国人民是团结得更加巩固了。朝中两国的妇女在保卫祖国的独立、自由、荣誉以及保卫世界和平安全的正义斗争中，自觉地充分发挥了潜在的力量，以同志爱和亲如骨肉的情谊团结起来了。
    中国妇女以由衷的鼓励和大量的物资支援朝鲜妇女和朝鲜人民的正义的祖国解放战争，并毫不犹豫地把自己的儿子和丈夫，直接送到朝鲜前线来支援我们。朝鲜妇女为这种崇高的友谊支援而感到无上的骄傲，并因为有数万万的中国姊妹和自己一起进行斗争而进一步地提高了胜利信心。
    朝鲜人民永远不会忘记中国人民志愿军在保卫我国的正义战争中所建立的伟大功勋。已经把儿子和丈夫送往前线的朝鲜妇女，像支援自己的亲人一样地支援着中国人民志愿军，尽一切力量帮助和爱护他们。
    朴正爱指出：朝中两国妇女和全体人民在并肩抗击美国侵略者及其走狗的正义战争中的血肉友谊和团结力量，是任何帝国主义侵略势力所不能摧毁的。这一巩固的友谊团结的基础，是朝中两国妇女的爱国主义精神和国际主义精神。在人民民主制度下，长期呻吟在封建主义、帝国主义压迫下的朝中两国妇女，摆脱了悲惨的生活，在政治、经济、社会、文化等各方面，得到了享有和男子同样的权利和自由的保障。她们决意保卫自己的人民民主制度的国家。同时，她们为了制止美英战争贩子企图制造的新战争，屹立在反对侵略保卫和平的斗争的最前线，在全世界的母亲和儿童面前，负起了在朝鲜战场上粉碎美国侵略者扩大战争的阴谋的责任。
    朴正爱最后说：今天，全世界爱好和平的妇女和善良的人民广泛地支援着我们的正义斗争，并期望我们取得胜利。在军事上政治上都遭到惨败的美帝国主义野兽，竟无视有关战争的国际法规和人类道德，灭绝人性地使用细菌武器。但是，美帝国主义野兽的任何暴行，都将在朝中两国人民和妇女的伟大团结力量面前遭到破产。我们相信：最后的光荣的胜利，一定属于朝中两国人民和妇女。为了自己祖国的独立自由和荣誉，为了全世界的和平安全，妇女的权利及孩子们的幸福的将来，把朝中两国妇女之间的友谊团结进一步加强和巩固起来！
