Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 20th (TASS dispatch): The American Peace Congress, held in Montevideo by peace fighters from various American countries, passed a resolution condemning war and policies of war preparation, and calling for a struggle for peace. The resolution pointed out: In various American countries, war preparations and war propaganda are being constantly strengthened, threatening the happiness and security of the people of all countries. The cause of these events is primarily the war policy pursued by the American ruling clique, who are unwilling to accept the principle of peaceful coexistence of different social systems.

The resolution said: "Because of this war policy, the people are being forced to bear a heavy burden of taxation, being forced to accept absurd and intolerable war budgets and economic treaties and agreements that harm our interests. Our oil, copper, tin, agricultural products, and other wealth necessary for our prosperity and progress are being forcibly plundered. We are being forced to supply soldiers and war bases on the territory of our countries. Therefore, this Congress condemns this war policy and declares that we absolutely cannot, under any pretext, under the guise of any agreement or any principle of friendship and unity among the peoples of the Americas, participate in a war that violates our most precious feelings and the most fundamental interests of mankind."

The resolution continued: The Congress concludes that the most effective and decisive way to realize the noble ideal of peace is for the five major powers to reach an agreement and conclude a peace pact, welcoming the participation of all countries.

The Congress calls on the people of the Americas to:

	(1) Strive for simultaneous and gradual disarmament under supervision by all countries, strive to ban atomic weapons and establish strict international supervision to enforce this ban, and strive for the complete use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

	(2) Oppose sending troops to Korea and advocate a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict.

	(3) Do everything possible to condemn the war policies pursued by certain groups in the United States; oppose militarization and war preparations; condemn the military agreements concluded by the governments of the Americas, and condemn these agreements that require the sacrifice of our youth, the material and cultural progress of our countries, and national sovereignty.

	(4) Denounce all forms of war propaganda.

	(5) Protest against the persecution of peace advocates, oppose the abolition of democratic rights, oppose racial discrimination, and support all those persecuted by racial discrimination.

	(6) Defend our mineral resources; ensure that these resources are only used to promote our economic development and the prosperity of the people.

	(7) Demand the elimination of restrictions on the free exchange of economic, scientific, and cultural activities between countries, as this exchange is conducive to strengthening peace and cooperation between countries and raising the living standards of the people.

	(8) Advocate that the five major powers—the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France—conclude a peace pact in which all other countries in the world can participate, and step up the collection of signatures for the declaration advocating the conclusion of such a peace pact.

The Congress specifically calls on the people of the Americas to sign in support of the peace pact and take joint action to defend peace.

The Congress also passed a special resolution condemning the United States for using bacteriological weapons in Korea. The resolution said: "The use of such weapons is simply an outrageous crime that fills the people of all countries around the world with immense anger from the bottom of their hearts. The Congress demands an immediate end to the use of such weapons against the Korean people. The Congress calls on the people of the Americas to strongly and resolutely protest against this act."

    美洲和平大会要求五大国缔结和平公约
    并通过决议谴责美国侵略者进行细菌战
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社蒙得维的亚二十日讯：美洲各国和平战士在蒙得维的亚举行的美洲和平大会通过决议，谴责战争和备战政策，号召为和平而斗争。决议指出：在美洲各国，战争准备和战争宣传正在不断地加强，威胁到各国人民的幸福和安全。产生这些事件的原因，首先是美国统治集团奉行的战争政策，他们不愿接受各种不同的社会制度和平共存的原则。
    决议说：“为了这种战争政策，人民被强迫承受沉重的赋税负担，被强迫接受荒唐到不能忍受的战争预算以及损害我们利益的经济条约和协定。我们的石油、铜、锡、农产品及其他等等我们的繁荣和进步所必需的财富，都被强暴地掠夺去了。我们被强迫供给士兵，供给我们各国领土上的战争基地。正因为这样，所以本大会谴责这种战争政策，并宣告我们绝不能以任何口实，绝不能藉口什么协议、什么美洲各国人民友好团结的原则，而参加一个违反我们最宝贵的感情和人类最根本利益的战争。”
    决议继续说：大会得出的结论是，要实现和平这种崇高的理想，最有效的最决定性的办法便是由五大国取得协议，缔结和平公约，欢迎一切国家参加。
    大会号召美洲各国人民：
    （一）努力争取各国同时逐步地在监督之下裁减军备，争取禁止原子武器并为执行这禁令而建立严格的国际监督，争取原子能完全用于和平目的。
    （二）反对派遣军队到朝鲜去，主张和平解决朝鲜冲突。
    （三）尽一切办法谴责美国某些集团奉行的战争政策；反对军国主义化和战争准备；谴责美洲各国政府缔结的军事协定，谴责这些要求牺牲我们的青年，牺牲各国的物质进步和文化进步以及民族主权的协定。
    （四）斥责一切形式的战争宣传。
    （五）抗议迫害和平拥护者，反对取缔民主权利，反对种族歧视并声援一切受种族歧视迫害的人。
    （六）保卫我们的矿物资源；使这些资源只用于促进我们的经济发展和人民的繁荣。
    （七）要求消除各国经济、科学和文化的自由交流所受到的限制，因为这种交流有利于加强各国间的和平和合作，提高人民的生活水准。
    （八）主张五大国——美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国和法国——缔结全世界其他一切国家都能参加的和平公约，加紧为主张缔结这种和平公约的宣言征集签名。
    大会特别号召美洲各国人民签名拥护和平公约，共同行动起来，保卫和平。
    大会并通过一项特别决议，谴责美国在朝鲜使用细菌武器。决议说：“使用这样的武器，简直是一种滔天罪行，使全世界各国人民都从内心感到无比的愤怒。大会要求马上停止对朝鲜人民使用这种武器。大会号召美洲人民强硬地坚决地抗议这种行为。”
