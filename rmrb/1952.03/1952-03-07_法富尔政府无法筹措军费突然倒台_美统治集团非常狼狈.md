Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: As U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, fresh from the NATO Council meeting in Lisbon, was boasting to Congress about his "achievements," the French Faure government suddenly collapsed. The direct cause of the collapse was the failure to pass in the National Assembly the financial bill requesting a 15% tax increase to fund the new military budget imposed on France by the Lisbon meeting. This fact greatly embarrassed the U.S. ruling clique. This embarrassment is clearly visible in the dispatches from American and French bourgeois news agencies, which used words like "panic," "discouraged," "great anxiety," and "very depressed" to describe the reaction of the U.S. ruling clique to the fall of the Faure government.

Agencé France-Presse (AFP), in a dispatch from Washington on February 29th, stated: "U.S. government officials expressed panic at the new French government crisis" because this event "shows France's refusal to fulfill its obligations undertaken at the Lisbon meeting." The Americans worry that "the cause assiduously built up by American diplomats over the past few months may be ruined."

United Press (UP), in a dispatch from Washington on the same day, said: "The sudden collapse of the French government inevitably made American diplomatic and military officials feel somewhat discouraged" because "the French government encountered difficulties in its proposal to increase new taxes to build French defenses (which should be read as the U.S.-prescribed war preparation tasks)."

The Overseas News Agency (ONA) Washington message on the 1st admitted: "The Atlantic Treaty nations expressed great anxiety because the French National Assembly failed to pass a tax increase for expanding armaments and the subsequent collapse of the Faure government." The message also stated: "Diplomatic circles believe that the fall of the Faure cabinet creates a fear that France's division will be detrimental to European efforts and set a bad example among the North Atlantic Treaty nations."

This development is a sharp mockery of the U.S. government, and the enraged U.S. imperialists disregarded diplomatic etiquette and openly and rudely interfered in France. According to ONA, the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives (responsible for drafting the so-called "foreign aid" appropriations) both openly declared: "(The U.S.) Congress has no intention of tolerating France's slow pace in expanding armaments." Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, even publicly said on the 3rd in the tone of a master to a servant: "France must fulfill its responsibilities," and he stipulated that France must make "the greatest effort" for the U.S. European war preparation plan. The "New York Times," one of the main mouthpieces of the American bourgeoisie, followed up with an editorial on the 4th, warning "French politicians" and "European countries" "not to ignore (Connally's) warning."

However, the cabinet crisis in France did not occur because those servile "French politicians" failed to diligently carry out the will of the United States, but because of the increasingly serious political and economic crisis that is universally present in "European countries." Therefore, even the "New York Times," after reprimanding those European lackeys, could not help but admit that unless the United States itself pays, "they have no way to obtain the conditions for rearmament." The newspaper also said depressingly: "The current development of the situation in Europe makes people wonder how enthusiastic Europeans are about consolidating their defenses."

Another major mouthpiece of the American bourgeoisie, the "New York Herald Tribune," also expressed pessimism, saying: "The impatience of some of our congressional speakers is understandable. However, we cannot therefore assume that some statements that are now being prepared can immediately alleviate the crisis as soon as they are issued."

    法富尔政府无法筹措军费突然倒台
    美统治集团非常狼狈
    【新华社六日讯】当刚从里斯本回国的美国国务卿艾奇逊正在国会内大吹他在北大西洋公约理事会会议上所得到的“成就”时，法国富尔政府突然倒台，倒台的直接原因是在国民议会内通不过它为筹措里斯本会议加给法国的新的军备预算而要求增税百分之十五的财政法案。这个事实使得美国统治集团非常狼狈。这种狼狈相从美、法资产阶级通讯社的电讯里也明显地看得出来，这些电讯用“惊慌”、“气馁”、“极大忧虑”、“甚为沮丧”等字眼来形容美国统治集团对富尔政府倒台的反应。
    法新社二月二十九日从华盛顿发出的电讯说：“美国政府人士对新的法国政府危机表示惊惶。”因为这件事情“说明法国拒绝履行它在里斯本会议上承担的义务”，美国人担心“美国外交官过去几个月来兢兢业业地造就的事业可能要毁于一旦了”。
    合众社同日发自华盛顿的消息说：“法国政府突然垮台，不免使美国外交与军事官员觉得有些气馁”，因为“法国政府是在增加新税以建立法国防务（应读作美国所规定的备战任务）的建议上遇到了困难”。
    国新社一日华盛顿消息承认：“大西洋公约国家因为法国国民议会未能通过为扩张军备而增加税收和随之而来的富尔政府的垮台而表示极大忧虑。”这则消息还说：“外交界人士认为富尔内阁的垮台造成这样一种恐惧，即法国的分裂对于欧洲努力将是不利的，并且在北大西洋公约国家中间树立了一个坏榜样。”
    事态的这一发展是对美国政府的一个尖锐的嘲弄，于是老羞成怒的美国帝国主义分子便顾不得外交的礼貌，公开对法国进行粗暴的干涉。据国新社消息，美国参众两院外交委员会（负责拟定所谓“援外”经费拨款）主席都公开宣告：“（美国）国会无意容忍法国扩张军备的迟缓。    ”参院外委会主席康纳利三日并公开以主人对奴仆的口吻说：“法国必须尽它的责任”，他限定法国对美国的欧洲备战计划“尽最大的努力”。美国资产阶级的主要喉舌之一“纽约时报”四日社论接着警告“法国政治家们”和“欧洲各国”“不要忽视（康纳利）这个警告”。
    但是法国内阁所以发生危机，并不是那些奴性的“法国政治家们”奉行美国的意志不力，而是普遍存在于“欧洲各国”愈来愈严重的政治与经济危机。因此，连“纽约时报”在训斥了那些欧洲仆从之后，也不能不承认，除非美国自己掏腰包，“否则它们就没有什么办法取得重整军备的条件”。该报并且沮丧地说：“欧洲目前的局势发展，使人们不禁怀疑欧洲人对于整顿他们的防务到底有多大的热情。”
    美国资产阶级另一主要喉舌“纽约先驱论坛报”也表示悲观说：“我们某些国会发言人的不耐烦是可以理解的。然而，我们却不能因此就以为，现在正在准备着的某些声明只要一发表，就马上可以把危机和缓下来。”
