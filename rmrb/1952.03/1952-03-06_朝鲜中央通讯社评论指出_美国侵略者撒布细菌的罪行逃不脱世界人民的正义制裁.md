Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 5th: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 3rd entitled "American Aggressors Attempt to Salvage Their Defeat with Germ Warfare," saying: The American aggressors have used bacteriological weapons more than once in their war of aggression against Korea. Now, the aggressors, who have suffered repeated defeats, are using bacteriological weapons on a large scale while holding Korean armistice talks, attempting to disrupt the armistice talks, massacre a large number of soldiers and civilians of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies and the people in the rear of Korea in order to expand the war and salvage their irretrievable defeat.

The commentary wrote: After the enemy retreated from northern Korea in December 1950, smallpox epidemics spread in the areas once occupied by them, while smallpox did not occur in areas not occupied by the enemy. This proves that the enemy had already used bacteriological weapons since then.

After exposing the crimes of the American aggressors colluding with Japanese bacteriological war criminals to conduct germ warfare, the commentary pointed out: However, the cold-resistant "bacterial soldiers" spread by Tojo's and Hitler's successors were effectively wiped out after landing. No matter what heinous crimes American imperialism commits, we, the Korean people, must, in accordance with the instructions of the Military Committee and the orders of General Kim Il-sung, as well as the government's epidemic prevention policies, wage an organized struggle against the enemy's germ warfare and smash the enemy's brutal conspiracy. The new and heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors cannot frighten the Korean people. Nor can it escape the just sanctions of the people of the whole world. The solidarity and support given to the Korean people by the kind people of the world are increasing day by day, and the fraternal Chinese people are calling on epidemic prevention workers to rise up in unison and vigorously assist the Korean military and civilians in fighting the enemy's germ warfare.

The commentary emphasized: All the Korean people resolutely oppose the American robbers' germ warfare. With extreme anger and a firm will to kill the enemy, they gathered in meetings, condemned and protested against the enemy's monstrous crimes, and unanimously and solemnly demanded that the American cannibals be given just sanctions.

    朝鲜中央通讯社评论指出
    美国侵略者撒布细菌的罪行逃不脱世界人民的正义制裁
    【新华社平壤五日电】朝鲜中央通讯社三日发表题为“美国侵略者企图以细菌战来挽救它的失败”的评论说：美国侵略者在其侵朝战争中已经不止一次地使用细菌武器。现在，连遭失败的侵略者，在举行朝鲜停战谈判的时候，又大量使用了细菌武器，企图破坏停战谈判，大量虐杀朝中人民军队和朝鲜后方人民，以扩大战争，挽救它无可挽回的败局。
    评论写道：一九五零年十二月敌人从朝鲜北部溃退以后，在一度被其侵占的地区就蔓延了天花疫病，而在未被敌人侵占的地区天花却没有发生过。这证明敌人早从那时起就已使用了细菌武器。
    评论在揭露了美国侵略者与日本细菌战犯勾结进行细菌战的罪状后，指出：但是，东条和希特勒的继承者所撒布的耐寒的“细菌士兵”，在着地以后就遭到了我们有效的扑灭。不管美帝国主义制造什么样的滔天罪行，我们朝鲜人民一定要按照军事委员会的指示和金日成将军的命令以及政府的防疫政策，与敌人的细菌战展开有组织的斗争，粉碎敌人的残暴阴谋。美国侵略者所制造的新的万恶罪行是吓不倒朝鲜人民的。它也逃不脱全世界人民的正义制裁的。全世界善良人民给予朝鲜人民的声援和支持日益加强，兄弟般的中国人民号召防疫工作者一致奋起，大力援助朝鲜军民与敌人的细菌战展开斗争。
    评论强调指出：全朝鲜人民坚决反对美国强盗的细菌战。他们以极端愤怒的心情和坚强的杀敌意志纷纷集会，痛斥和抗议敌人的滔天罪行，并一致严正要求给予美国吃人生番以正义的制裁。
