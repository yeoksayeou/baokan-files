    Newspapers Should Not Be Fooled by False Confessions of Corrupt Officials and Thieves
    Jiang Heng
    In the sharp struggle against corruption and theft, some law-breaking capitalists and major corrupt officials often pretend to be serious, downplaying their offenses and "confessing" to some trivial matters, deceiving everyone in an attempt to get through the "checkpoint." However, some newspaper staff members do not have enough understanding of this and often believe and publish some false confessions. This inadvertently makes the newspaper a "hiding place" for thieves.
    Based on inspections of newspapers in various places, this phenomenon is not universal, but it is quite serious. For example, in the Tianjin Progress Daily's January 9th first-page news story "Tianjin Construction Industry Launches Anti-Bribery Campaign," they were misled by the sweet talk of Qi Yushu (Director of Tianjin Construction Industry Association), a major thief who was not effective in leading the movement and refused to make a thorough confession, saying that Qi Yushu and others "took the lead in confessing" and "seriously mobilized all members of the industry," so that the movement "gradually unfolded"; and also said that the "basic reason" why the construction industry was able to mobilize quickly was because Qi Yushu "attached importance to this movement," and so on. However, in less than a month, Qi Yushu revealed his true colors under the relentless pursuit of the "members of the entire industry." The February 3rd second-page news story in the Progress Daily, "Reorganization of Tianjin Construction Industry Association," also illustrates this fact. It turns out that this "leading confessant," Qi Yushu, "not only did not actively lead the movement and take the lead in confessing; but instead used all kinds of shameless means to openly obstruct and resist the development of the movement." Therefore, he was announced to be removed from his post. But the seriousness of the inaccurate reporting is not limited to this, but also lies in completely obliterating Qi Yushu's evil deeds. According to employee Zhang Yanling, Qi Yushu did everything possible to distort and slander the movement at the mobilization meeting on January 3rd. Qi Yushu once said publicly: "Everyone quickly tell us about the cadres extorting from us! We must raise 'vigilance' in our future speech, and the government will not 'make things difficult' for us." The cunning law-breaking capitalists were so "vigilant" in slandering the movement; but some reporters were so lacking in vigilance that they were even captured by law-breaking capitalists.
    Another example is the February 13th Shandong Dazhong Daily, which easily published a false confession letter from the major corrupt official An Chengxi (staff member of the business section of Shandong Construction Engineering Company) in the "Reader's Letters" column. In this letter, An pretended to be serious and said how he had gone through "ideological struggle" and had "confessed" to the problem of "embezzling and accepting bribes totaling more than 4.8 million yuan." And he indicated that his "ideological baggage" had been completely put down. However, in just seven days, it was revealed by reader Sun Bo's letter (see February 20th Dazhong Daily) that this was not the case at all. It turns out that An Chengxi, who "confessed" to embezzling and accepting bribes of "more than 4.8 million yuan," was a big "tiger" who "embezzled up to 600 million yuan, but it is still not thorough."
    Cunning corrupt officials and thieves are thus planning and taking advantage of every opportunity to resist the movement and cover up their crimes. But their attempt to take advantage of the temporary lack of understanding of the actual situation by newspaper staff members is ultimately futile. While Shandong Dazhong Daily exposed the trick of the major corrupt official An Chengxi "using newspapers to make false confessions" for the second time, it also reviewed the lack of high vigilance and investigation and research work by the editorial department.
    The editorial departments of newspapers in various places should learn from the above lessons: increase vigilance against corrupt officials and thieves, and carefully handle submissions and letters related to confessions and self-criticisms. Some of these submissions and letters should be subjected to necessary investigation and research, and some should be reviewed by the frugality inspection committee of the individual's organization. As a newspaper commanding operations, it must never be sloppy, be deceived by the sweet talk of false confessions, and make the newspaper a "hiding place" for corrupt officials and thieves.

    报纸不要为贪污犯盗窃犯的假坦白所骗
    江横
    在反贪污、反盗窃的尖锐斗争中，有些违法资本家和大贪污犯往往假装正经，避重就轻，“坦白”
    一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事，欺骗大家，企图混过“关”去。可是，有些报纸工作人员对此认识不够，常把
    一些假坦白书，信以为真，发表出来。这就使报纸无意中作了偷盗犯的“藏身之所”。
    根据对各地报纸的检查，这种现象虽不是普遍的，但却是相当严重的。例如天津进步日报在一月九日一版“津营造业反行贿运动展开”的新闻中，曾对领导运动不力和拒不彻底坦白的大盗窃犯齐玉书（天津市营造业同业公会主任委员）的甜言蜜语所迷惑，说什么齐玉书等怎样“带头坦白”，“认真发动全业会员”，使运动“逐步展开”；又说什么营造业所以能够迅速动员起来的“基本原因”，是由于齐玉书“重视这一运动”等等。可是为时不到一个月，齐玉书就在“全业会员”的穷追猛打之下，显露了原形。二月三日进步日报二版“津营造业公会改组”的新闻，也说明了这一事实。原来这个
    “带头坦白”的齐玉书，“不但没有积极地领导运动，带头坦白；反而以种种无耻手段，公开进行阻挠和抗拒运动的开展”。因而被宣布撤职。但报道失实的严重性还不止此，还在于把齐玉书的恶迹一笔抹煞了。据职工张延龄说，齐玉书在一月三日动员大会上就对运动极尽歪曲污蔑之能事。齐玉书就曾这样公然说：“大家快把干部向我们勒索的事情说出来罢！我们以后说话要提高‘警惕’，政府就不会‘刁难’我们了。”狡猾的违法资本家是那样的“提高警惕”，污蔑运动；但有些记者却是这样的丧失警惕，竟至作了违法资本家的俘虏。
    又如二月十三日山东大众日报“读者来信”栏轻易地刊登了大贪污犯安承禧（山东建筑工程公司营业课的工作人员）假坦白的来信。安犯在这封来信里，装得像煞有介事地说什么自己经过怎样的“思想斗争”，已经“坦白”了“共贪污受贿约计四百八十多万元”的问题。并表明自己的“思想包袱”已完全放下了。可是为时不过七天，经读者笋波来信揭发（见二月二十日大众日报），根本不是那么回事。原来这个“坦白”贪污受贿“四百八十多万元”的安承禧，却是一个“贪污达六亿元，但也还不彻底”的大“老虎”。
    狡猾的贪污犯盗窃犯就是这样有计划地无孔不入地抵抗运动，掩饰罪行。但他们这种利用报纸工作人员一时不了解实际情况的空隙的妄图，毕竟是徒劳的。山东大众日报在二次揭发了大贪污犯安承禧“利用报纸进行假坦白”的诡计同时，对编辑部缺乏高度警惕性和调查研究工作，也作了检讨。
    各地报纸编辑部应该接受上述教训：提高对贪污犯盗窃犯的警惕性，慎重处理有关坦白检讨一类的来稿来信。这些来稿来信，有的应经过必要的调查研究，有的应经过本人所在机关节约检查委员会的审查。作为指挥作战的报纸，绝不能潦草从事，为甜言蜜语的假坦白所骗，而使报纸成为贪污犯盗窃犯的“藏身之所”。
