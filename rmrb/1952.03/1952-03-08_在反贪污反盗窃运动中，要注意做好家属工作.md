    In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement and the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state assets, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement, the family members of staff, workers, shop assistants, other laborers, and even people in industry and commerce, under the leadership of the central and local savings inspection committees of various agencies and organizations, have successively participated in these two major movements. Some have persuaded criminal relatives to confess, and some have reported the crimes of other illegal capitalists and corrupt elements, playing a considerable role. However, many family members have expressed hesitation and wavering in the face of such a great movement. Some of them, while acknowledging the illegal acts of the bourgeoisie, dare not face the criminal acts of their own relatives, or, having recognized the crimes of their relatives, have various concerns and are unwilling to sincerely advise and thoroughly confess. Even a few stubborn women have secretly formed "alliances of defense" with their relatives, even helping them to destroy evidence, conceal赃物 (booty), and insist on being enemies of the people, hindering the progress of the movement.

    These two aspects of the facts tell us that the attitude of family members, good or bad, often has a significant impact on whether the movement can be carried out smoothly. Therefore, in these two major movements, we must implement the policy of mobilizing both men and women together. That is to say, in agencies and organizations, we must mobilize male and female staff and their families together; in society, we must mobilize male and female workers and their families, male and female shop assistants and their families, and other laborers and their families together, and make industrialists and businessmen and their families receive education and be inspected together. Existing experience has proven that this can be done.

    In order to do a good job in family work, we must repeatedly conduct policy education for family members, patiently and tirelessly explaining the great political significance of the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement, fully exposing the serious harm to the country and the people of illegal capitalists and corrupt elements stealing state wealth, exposing the despicable behavior of illegal capitalists using women as commodities, toys, and sugar-coated bullets, and especially repeatedly explaining the people's government's policy towards corrupt elements and illegal capitalists, pointing out that only by thoroughly confessing, sincerely repenting, reporting others, and performing meritorious service to atone for their crimes can corrupt elements and illegal capitalists find a way out.

    Investigating and understanding the situation of family members, distinguishing different types, and making various different demands is also a very important task. For the families of workers, shop assistants, and other laborers, they should be required to bravely report the crimes of illegal capitalists and corrupt elements, and expose the mistakes of bureaucratic and wasteful elements. For the families of industrialists and businessmen, they should be required to thoroughly confess their own criminal acts and mobilize their lawbreaking husbands and fathers and brothers to thoroughly confess. For the families of agency staff, they should be required to sincerely advise or bravely report relatives with criminal behavior, eliminate the decadent thoughts of the bourgeoisie, study the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, raise their political awareness, cultivate and develop their independent ability, and promote a hard-working and thrifty style. For various types of women such as ordinary housewives, intellectual women who have newly joined revolutionary work, and female cadres who have undergone considerable long-term revolutionary struggle training, we should deeply understand their different ideological situations, treat them differently, and carefully and thoroughly break through their ideological concerns. According to current understanding, the reason why family members whose husbands and fathers and brothers have criminal behavior do not dare to expose their evils is generally because they are afraid of "losing face," afraid of "government punishment," afraid of "financial difficulties," afraid of "hurting marital feelings," and afraid of "implicating themselves," so they dare not report or advise. However, different types of people have different concerns, so we must carefully analyze them, patiently mobilize and persuade them, talk about the great principles of loving the country and the people from the personal and family interests, and use real people and real events as examples to gradually enlighten them. And adopt methods such as large meetings, small meetings, and individual visits to carry out education and persuasion work repeatedly and tirelessly.

    To mobilize all family members universally, there must be appropriate organizations and dedicated personnel in charge of regularly and systematically carrying out family work. In local areas, in addition to the trade unions being responsible for the work of the families of employees who live together, the local women's federations should be responsible for the work of the families of employees who live scattered. In order to adapt to the needs of the current movement, the local women's federations should also concentrate more cadres under the unified leadership of the local savings and inspection committees to vigorously carry out family work. The Beijing Municipal Women's Federation once concentrated 34 female teachers and more than 1,000 female students to go deep into the streets to carry out work among female shop assistants, shop assistant families, and industrial and commercial families. The Xi'an Municipal Women's Federation also organized 180 persuasion groups to go deep into industrial and commercial households to carry out work, mobilizing the families of illegal industrialists and businessmen to persuade illegal industrialists and businessmen to confess. These practices have already achieved certain results. Similar practices should also be adopted in agencies and organizations. Either a women's work committee is established in the agency trade union, and families are organized by dormitory unit to carry out work regularly; or the personnel department leads the work, and it should never be allowed to drift on its own. No matter which aspect leads it, no matter what organizational form is adopted, it should be determined according to the specific situation of each agency and organization. Each agency must designate dedicated personnel to be responsible for the family work of the staff of the agency, and should not rely on any organizations outside the agency to do it. That is not only impossible, but also cannot be done well. It must be pointed out that whether carrying out family work in local or agency organizations, attention must be paid to cultivating family activists and promoting them to do the work, which can both deepen the work and solve the difficulty of lacking cadres.

    The Party's full concern and attention is the decisive factor in doing a good job in family work. Party committees at all levels must earnestly lead the Party organizations in various agencies, organizations, factories, and streets, and educate all female party members, female League members, and non-party female activists to do a good job in family work in the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement.

    In the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement, for the various problems that have been reported and exposed that violate the Marriage Law and disregard or destroy the interests of women and children, we must solve them in a practical way, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies; and in the staff of agencies and organizations and among the people, we must resolutely eliminate the reactionary thoughts of feudalism and the bourgeoisie that discriminate against and oppress women and children.

    We believe that as long as we can persist in the family work that has been established in this movement, regularly and systematically organize families, educate families, and raise the political awareness of families, we will certainly be able to more widely mobilize and organize women and become an important force in defending the motherland and building the motherland.

### 在反贪污反盗窃运动中，要注意做好家属工作

    在反贪污反盗窃运动中，要注意做好家属工作
    在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动和反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报运动中，机关工作人员、职工、店员、其他劳动者以至工商界的家属们，在中央及各地各机关团体的节约检查委员会的领导之下，已先后参加了这两大运动，有的劝说犯罪的亲属坦白，有的检举其他违法资本家和贪污分子的罪行，起了相当的作用。但是也有不少家属，在这样伟大的运动面前表示犹豫动摇。她们有的虽然承认资产阶级的违法行为，但不敢正视自己亲人的犯罪行为，或者认识了自己亲人的罪行，而有种种顾虑，不肯真诚规劝，彻底交代。更有少数执迷不悟的妇女，与自己的亲属暗订“攻守同盟”，甚至帮助亲属消灭罪证，隐瞒赃物，坚持与人民为敌，阻碍运动的前进。
    这两方面的事实告诉我们，家属们态度的好坏，对于运动的能否顺利开展，往往会发生不小的影响。因此在这两大运动中，必须贯彻男女一齐发动的方针。这就是说，在机关、团体中，要做到男女工作人员及其家属一齐发动；在社会上要做到男女职工和职工家属、男女店员和店员家属以及其他劳动者和家属们一齐发动，并使工商业者及其家属一齐受教育，一齐受检查。已有的经验证明，这是可以做到的。
    为了做好家属工作，我们要向家属们反复进行政策教育，耐心地不疲倦地反复说明反贪污和反盗窃运动的伟大政治意义，充分揭露违法资本家和贪污分子盗窃国家财富对于国家和人民的严重危害，揭发违法资本家以妇女为商品、玩具和糖衣炮弹的卑劣行为，特别要反复说明人民政府对于贪污分子和违法资本家的政策，指出贪污分子和违法资本家只有彻底坦白，真诚悔过，检举别人，戴罪立功，才有出路。
    调查了解家属们的情况，分别不同类型，提出各种不同的要求，也是非常重要的工作。对于职工家属、店员家属及其他劳动者家属，应要求她们勇敢检举违法资本家和贪污分子的罪行，揭露官僚主义分子和浪费分子的错误。对于工商业者的家属，应要求她们彻底坦白自己的犯罪行为，并动员犯法的丈夫和父兄彻底坦白交代。对于机关工作人员的家属，应要求她们真诚规劝或勇敢检举有犯罪行为的亲属，清除资产阶级的腐朽思想，学习中国共产党和人民政府的政策，提高政治觉悟，培养和发扬她们独立自主的能力，提倡艰苦朴素的作风，厉行节约。对于普通的家庭妇女、新参加革命工作的知识妇女、经过相当长期革命斗争锻炼的女干部等各种不同类型的妇女，应深入了解她们的不同思想情况，分别对待，细致深入地打破她们的思想顾虑。根据现在了解，凡是丈夫和父兄有犯罪行为的家属，她们所以不敢暴露其罪恶，一般的是怕“失面子”，怕“受政府处分”，怕“生活困难”，怕“伤夫妇感情”，怕“牵累自己”，因此不敢检举，不敢劝说。但是各种不同类型的人，还有各种不同的顾虑，因此必须仔细加以分析，耐心进行动员和说服，从个人的、家庭的利害说到爱国、爱人民的大道理，用真人真事来做榜样，逐渐加以开导。并采取大会、小会和个别访问等方式，再三再四地不疲倦地进行教育和说服工作。
    要把所有的家属普遍动员起来，必须要有适当的组织和专人负责，经常地有计划地进行家属工作。在地方上，除对于集中居住的职工家属，应由当地工会负责进行工作，对于分散居住的职工家属，应由当地民主妇女联合会负责进行工作以外，为了适应当前运动的需要，各地民主妇女联合会还应该在当地节约检查委员会的统一领导下，集中较多的干部，大力开展家属工作。北京市民主妇女联合会曾集中了女教师三十四人女学生一千余人深入街道，在女店员、店员家属、工商业者家属中进行工作。西安市民主妇女联合会也组织了一百八十个规劝小组，深入到工商户去进行工作，动员违法工商业者的家属，规劝违法工商业者坦白。这些做法，都已经收到了一定的效果。在机关、团体中也应该采取类似这样的做法。或者是在机关工会中设立妇女工作委员会，以宿舍为单位，把家属们组织起来，经常进行工作；或者是由人事部门领导来进行工作，决不应该听其自流。无论由那一方面来领导，无论采取那一种组织形式，都应该根据各机关、团体的具体情况来规定。各机关必须指定专人，负责做本机关工作人员的家属工作，而不应该依赖本机关以外的任何团体来做。那样不但是不可能的，也是做不好的。必须指出，不论在地方或机关团体中进行家属工作，都必须注意培养家属积极分子，提拔她们来做工作，这样既能使工作深入，又能解决缺乏干部的困难。
    党的充分关怀和重视，是做好家属工作的决定因素。各级党委必须认真地领导各机关、团体、工厂、街道中的党的组织，并教育所有的女党员、女团员和非党妇女积极分子，在反贪污反盗窃运动中做好家属工作。
    在反贪污、反盗窃运动中，对于已被检举和揭露出来的违反婚姻法、漠视或摧残妇女儿童利益的各种问题，我们必须分别轻重缓急，切实予以解决；并在机关、团体的工作人员中、人民群众中，坚决清除封建的、资产阶级的歧视和压迫妇女儿童的反动思想。
    我们相信只要我们能够把这次运动中已经建立起来的家属工作坚持下去，经常有计划地组织家属，教育家属，提高家属的政治觉悟，我们就一定能够把妇女群众更广泛地发动和组织起来，成为保卫祖国、建设祖国的一支重要的力量。
