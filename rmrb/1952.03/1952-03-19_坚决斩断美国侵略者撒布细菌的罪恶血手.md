The towering crime of the American aggressors in inhumanely and brutally conducting germ warfare in Korea and the northeastern and Qingdao areas of Shandong in our country has aroused extreme indignation among peace-loving people all over the world. Righteous people everywhere are carrying out powerful protest movements against the American use of bacteriological weapons. In particular, the defenders of world peace – the working people of Moscow, Soviet Union – held a grand rally on the 13th of this month, angrily protesting the heinous crimes committed by the American aggressors in Korea and China; following this, Soviet representative Malik, at a meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission on the 14th of this month, severely condemned the American crime of conducting germ warfare in Korea and China, and demanded that the Disarmament Commission immediately consider this issue. This just condemnation by Malik fully represents the common aspiration of peace-loving people all over the world and will inevitably receive the heartfelt support and endorsement of peace-loving people throughout the world.

The facts are very clear: the American aggressors' insane and outrageous crime of conducting germ warfare against the Korean and Chinese people has not only completely violated international conventions, but also seriously threatens and destroys the civilization, justice, and security of all mankind. This is far more serious than the crimes committed by the Japanese fascists and Hitler aggressors against the peace-loving people of the world during the Second World War. All peace-loving people in the world are unanimously denouncing such heinous American murderers, and the United Nations Disarmament Commission should clearly not turn a blind eye to this. Therefore, Malik's proposal to this commission to condemn and prohibit the United States from conducting germ warfare is completely reasonable and just, and it is also a serious test for this international organization, which claims to reduce armaments and eliminate the crisis of war. The countries participating in this commission must recognize that they are facing an extremely serious issue related to the safety of all mankind, and they should strive to break free from the new war trap set by the United States for them (the United States is carrying out the war of aggression against Korea in the name of the United Nations). If there are still people among them who continue to be deluded, listen to the arbitrary manipulation of the United States, and help the United States cover up this monstrous crime, then he will inevitably anger the peace-loving and just people of the world, and prove that he, like the American aggressors, is an enemy of human justice and security.

The American murderers, who have been angrily denounced by the people of the world, are trying to cover up their crimes with shameless denials. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson and U.S. "United Nations Forces" Commander Ridgway have repeatedly repeated the lie that "United Nations Forces have not conducted and are not conducting any germ warfare in the past or present." Acheson also attempted to cover up their crimes, which are deeply hated by mankind, with the shameless trick of requesting a "on-site investigation" by the "International Committee of the Red Cross," and to use this to ease the world's people's angry condemnation of them. They think that as long as they repeatedly repeat their outrageous lies and repeatedly play the trick of "on-site investigation," they can deceive the people of the world. However, in fact, anyone with a clear mind can see at a glance how shameless a political fraud the tricks played by the likes of Acheson are. Everyone knows that the "International Committee of the Red Cross" has long become a tool arbitrarily directed by American imperialism. The people in charge of this committee are so loyal to their American masters that they even refuse to condemn the brutal crimes of the American aggressors in indiscriminately bombing Red Cross hospitals and slaughtering Red Cross staff in Korea. At the Korean armistice talks, the U.S. representatives also repeatedly tried to have personnel dispatched by the "International Committee of the Red Cross" go to northern Korea to work for the American aggressors. This situation clearly illustrates that the reason why the likes of Acheson repeatedly propose the so-called "investigation" is precisely to take this opportunity to send those special agents, who are dressed in the "impartial" guise of the "International Committee of the Red Cross" and hired by the United States, to the northern areas of Korea to collect reports on the effects of germ warfare for them. This inferior deceptive tactic, commonly used by American liars, is clearly absolutely unsalable in front of the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world.

The American swindlers, with ulterior motives, also knew that their despicable and shameless trick of deception would definitely be seen through. Therefore, after Acheson put forward the so-called "on-site investigation" proposal, they tried their best to use their reactionary newspapers and news agencies to tout the "reputation" of the "International Committee of the Red Cross" in order to deceive people into paying attention to the so-called "investigation" trick. A dispatch from Washington by the U.S. Information Service on March 11 stated: "The International Committee of the Red Cross has been dedicated to assisting patients for more than 100 years, and its reputation is well known, and it cannot be said that its activities have political conspiracies." This statement of "a guilty conscience doth need no accuser" is precisely an unconfessed confession of the American swindlers. This even more nakedly exposes that the so-called "on-site investigation" proposal is a completely ugly political conspiracy.

The towering crime of the American murderers in conducting germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people cannot be covered up by the lies and tricks of the likes of Acheson. At the end of January this year, Colonel Creasy, director of the "Research and Development Division" of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, publicly revealed the appalling intentions of the American murderers, saying: "I believe that this weapon (i.e., bacteriological weapon) that we are researching can enable us to weaken the enemy's resistance at the least cost, thereby achieving victory." Creasy also said: If people get sick and die, the factories and houses will remain intact in the hands of the victors. What an outrageous and hateful bloody confession this is. American officials and generals are so unscrupulous in earning profits from death and bloodshed for the big Wall Street financial tycoons and plundering the resources and property of the people of various countries. On the 4th of this month, reporter Dibble of the U.S. Associated Press, returning from Korea, revealed in a dispatch from New York about the factors hindering and delaying the Korean armistice talks that the American aggressors believed that "Korea is a particularly useful place to experiment with weapons." The confessions of Creasy and Dibble completely exposed the shameful lies of the likes of Acheson in flatly denying that the U.S. military is conducting planned germ warfare.

However, the bloodthirsty beasts of the likes of Acheson, Ridgway, and Creasy, attempting to save their failure with their insane and outrageous crimes and to realize their sinister plan of slaughtering the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people in the world, will eventually go bankrupt. The angry Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world will surely continue to give heavy blows to the brutal American aggressors until they stop their bloody crimes.

We, the Chinese people, fully support Malik's proposal at the United Nations Disarmament Commission and are fully willing to stand with the peace-loving people of the world, unyieldingly wage a resolute struggle against the American aggressors, and resolutely chop off the sinister, blood-stained hands of the American murderers spreading germs!

### 坚决斩断美国侵略者撒布细菌的罪恶血手

    坚决斩断美国侵略者撒布细菌的罪恶血手
    美国侵略者灭绝人性、残暴无耻地在朝鲜和我国东北及山东青岛地区进行细菌战的滔天罪行，已引起了全世界爱好和平人民的极度愤怒。世界各处正义的人民都进行着反对美国使用细菌武器的强大的抗议运动。特别是世界和平的捍卫者——苏联的莫斯科劳动人民在本月十三日举行了盛大集会，愤怒抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国所犯下的这种令人发指的罪行；接着，苏联代表马立克在本月十四日联合国裁减军备委员会的会议上，严厉地谴责了美国在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪行，要求裁减军备委员会立即考虑这个问题。马立克的这一公正的谴责，完全代表了全世界爱好和平人民的共同意愿，必然会得到全世界爱好和平人民的衷心支持和拥护。
    事实非常明显，美国侵略者对朝鲜和中国人民进行细菌战的疯狂绝顶的罪行，不仅已彻底地破坏了国际公约，并且严重地威胁和破坏着全体人类的文明、正义和安全。这比日本法西斯和希特勒侵略者在第二次世界大战期中对世界和平人民所犯下的罪行还要严重万分。对于这样罪大恶极的美国杀人犯，全世界爱好和平的人民都一致加以声讨，联合国裁减军备委员会对此显然是不应该熟视无睹的。因此，马立克向这个委员会提出谴责和禁止美国进行细菌战的建议，是完全合理的和正义的，而且这对于以裁减军备和消除战争危机为标榜的这个国际机构也是一个严重的考验。参加这个委员会的各国，必须认清他们所面对着的是一个极其严肃的关系全人类安全的问题，他们应该努力摆脱美国为他们所设下的新的战争陷阱（美国是以联合国的名义进行侵略朝鲜战争的）。如果在他们当中还有人继续执迷不悟，听从美国任意摆布，并且帮同美国掩盖这种滔天罪行，那末，他就必然会触怒全世界爱好和平与正义的人民，而证明他和美国侵略者一样是人类正义和安全的敌人。
    受到全世界人民愤怒斥责的美国杀人犯，正力图以无耻的抵赖来遮盖他们的罪行。美国国务卿艾奇逊和美国的“联合国军”总司令李奇微，接二连三地重复“联合国军过去未进行现在也未进行任何细菌战”的这句谎言，艾奇逊还企图以要求由“红十字国际委员会”来进行“实地调查”的无耻诡计，来掩盖他们为人类所深恶痛绝的罪行，并借以缓和世界人民对他们的愤怒斥责。他们以为只要屡次重复他们的漫天大谎，并一再耍弄“实地调查”的诡计就可以蒙混天下人的耳目。但是，事实上任何神志清醒的人都可以一眼看出艾奇逊之流所玩弄的诡计，是怎样无耻的一种政治欺诈。谁都知道，“红十字国际委员会”早已成为美国帝国主义任意指使的一个工具，这个委员会的负责人们对于他们的美国主子是那样忠实，甚至对于美国侵略者在朝鲜滥炸红十字会医院，屠杀红十字会工作人员的残暴罪行竟都拒绝加以谴责。在朝鲜停战谈判的会议上，美方代表也曾屡次努力想使“红十字国际委员会”所派遣的工作人员到朝鲜北部为美国侵略者工作。这种情形极其清楚地说明了艾奇逊之流所以一再提出所谓“调查”的建议，正是企图借此机会将那些披着“红十字国际委员会”的“公正”外衣，受美国雇佣的特务分子派遣到朝鲜北部地区，为他们搜集关于细菌战的效果的报告。美国骗子们所惯用的这种低劣的欺诈手法，在中朝人民和世界爱好和平人民的面前显然是绝对不能得售的。
    心怀鬼胎的美国骗子们，也明知道他们卑鄙无耻的障眼术是一定要被人识破的，因此他们在艾奇逊提出了所谓“实地调查”的建议之后，曾尽力利用他们的反动报刊和通讯社为“红十字国际委员会”的“名誉”吹嘘，以骗取人们对于所谓“调查”诡计的注意。美国新闻处三月十一日自华盛顿发出的电讯中曾这样说：“红十字国际委员会一百多年来致力于协助病人的名誉是尽人皆知的，而不能说它的活动有政治阴谋”。这种“此地无银三百两”的说法，正是美国骗子们不打自招的供词。这更赤裸裸地暴露出，所谓“实地调查”的建议完全是极端丑恶的政治阴谋。
    美国杀人犯对中朝人民进行细菌战的弥天大罪，是艾奇逊之流的谎言和骗术所绝对掩盖不住的。今年一月底，美国陆军化学兵团“研究与发展处”处长克利西就曾公开透露美国杀人犯们的骇人听闻的心意，他说：“我相信我们正在研究的这种武器（即细菌武器）可以使我们能够花最少的代价削弱敌人的抵抗力，从而取得胜利。”克利西还说：如果人害病死了，工厂和房子就会原封不动地落在战胜者的手中。这是多末令人发指、令人愤恨的血腥供状。美国的官员们和将军们就是这样伤天害理地为华尔街的大财主们从死亡和血泊中捞取利润，并掠夺各国人民的资源和财产的。本月四日，美国合众社自朝鲜返国的记者迪波尔从纽约发出的电讯中，谈到美国阻挠和拖延朝鲜停战谈判的因素时，也透露美国侵略者认为“朝鲜是一个实验武器的特别有用的地方”。克利西和迪波尔的供状，彻底地揭破了艾奇逊之流矢口否认美国军队有计划地进行细菌战的可耻谎言。
    然而，艾奇逊、李奇微和克利西之流的嗜血野兽，企图以他们疯狂绝顶的罪行来挽救他们的失败，来实现他们屠杀中朝人民及全世界和平人类的罪恶计划，最后一定是要破产的。愤怒的中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民必然会再接再厉地给残暴的美国侵略者以沉重的打击，直到他们停止他们的血腥罪行而后止。
    我们中国人民完全支持马立克在联合国裁减军备委员会上的提议，并且完全愿意与全世界和平人民在一起，不屈不挠地与美国侵略者进行坚决的斗争，一定要斩断美国杀人犯们撒布细菌的罪恶血手！
