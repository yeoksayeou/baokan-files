The rainfall in Chahar Province is very low and unevenly distributed each year, especially during the severe droughts of late spring and early summer. Adding to this, nine-tenths of the cultivated land in the area is dry land, making timely sowing often difficult. However, under the leadership of the local people's government, the farmers of Chahar have continuously fought against drought, not only overcoming the droughts of 1949 and 1951 but also accumulating many experiences in drought prevention and resistance, adopting relatively effective methods for moisture retention, drought prevention, and drought-resistant planting.

Moisture Retention and Drought Prevention

To retain moisture and prevent drought, farmers in Chahar Province have adopted methods of meticulous land preparation and multiple hoeings and weedings in their cultivation. According to their experience, only by storing moisture can they retain it; only by retaining moisture can they sow and ensure seedling emergence in time. The method for storing moisture in the soil is to plow more, plow deeply, and harrow and roll after plowing each time, starting in the autumn of each year. In this way, the soil's ability to retain moisture increases with the thickening of the loose soil layer. In the following spring, if the land is not too dry, it should be plowed shallowly once and harrowed and rolled several times. If the land is already dry, it should not be plowed again but should only be harrowed early and frequently. After sowing and seedling emergence, the main method of moisture retention is to hoe more, hoeing when there are weeds, when the soil surface is dry, and after rain. Yang Shunkui, a model worker in Chicheng, achieved a bumper harvest of millet on dry land by adopting this method of moisture retention and drought prevention. His land was plowed three times, harrowed three times, rolled three times, and pressed once. After harvesting before the end of the year, it was immediately plowed shallowly (about four inches) once, followed by double harrowing (each harrowing starting from the half side previously harrowed) once, then cross-rolled and straight-rolled once each; before the frost sets in, it was deeply plowed (about five inches) once, followed by immediate harrowing and rolling once or twice; in early spring of the following year, when the ground thaws about four or five tenths, it was rolled once, and before sowing after Grain Rain, it was plowed shallowly again once, followed by harrowing and rolling once each. After the seedlings emerged, they were weeded early once, followed by four more weedings.

Another method used by farmers in Chahar Province to retain moisture is to apply plenty of fully decomposed organic fertilizer. The specific method is to pile up the fertilizer collected from May to October each year (cattle and pig manure, weeds, fertile soil, etc.), add appropriate amounts of water to make it decompose, and then apply it to the fields before spring sowing. This fertilizer, after decomposition and containing more organic matter, can not only increase soil fertility but also increase the soil's ability to store and retain moisture after application. Yang Shunkui, a model worker in Chahar Province, uses this method to accumulate and apply fertilizer.

In addition, they also have a method of drought prevention and moisture retention, which is to store water and nurture ice, expand the area of spring thawing, and increase the moisture in the soil.

Drought-Resistant Planting

One method of drought-resistant planting used by farmers in Chahar Province is to utilize the soil moisture to sow in a timely manner, with five specific methods: (1) Furrow-guided sowing: First, use an empty seeder, tie grass bundles to the seeder feet, and use it to open up the dry soil in front, then use another seeder behind to sow in the exposed moist soil; after sowing, use a roller to press it once first, and then cover it with a shallow layer of dry soil to prevent moisture evaporation. (2) Borrowed-moisture sowing: In winter, send the well-decomposed fertilizer with appropriate moisture to the field, and immediately cover it with moist soil for future use. When sowing in the spring, if the soil moisture is not good and seedling emergence is not guaranteed, the seeds can be mixed with these decomposed and moisture-containing fertilizers for sowing to increase the moisture needed by the seeds. (3) Seizing-moisture sowing: When the soil temperature in spring reaches the temperature that can make the seeds germinate, sow in advance; although the temperature is low and germination is slow at this time, the roots can grow deep downward, which can increase the drought resistance of the seedlings. (4) Semi-moist soil sowing: If the land is not too dry, but sowing the seeds cannot guarantee seedling emergence, the seeds can be soaked first and then sown in the soil.

The method of carrying water for spot sowing used by farmers in Chahar Province is similar to that commonly used by farmers in various places. According to their experience: (1) Spot sowing is suitable for crops such as beans, corn, sorghum, peanuts, sunflowers, and potatoes. (2) When spot sowing small-grain crops (millet, sorghum, etc.), it is necessary to predetermine the ridges, and then dig a small ditch (also five or six inches or seven or eight inches long) every five or six inches or seven or eight inches along the ridges, and water the ditch; after the water has seeped in, scatter ten to twenty seeds at both ends and in the middle of the ditch, leaving three or four seedlings after emergence, arranged in a triangular shape. In this way, the small seedlings are easy to survive, and it is also easy to thin the seedlings later. In general, whether spot sowing large-grain crops or small-grain crops, attention should be paid to: after watering, wait until the water has seeped in before sowing and covering with soil; after covering with soil, use your hands to gently pat it flat, or use a hoe to push it flat, but never press it down forcefully or step on it with your feet, so as to avoid the moist soil becoming hard lumps after drying, which will hinder seedling emergence.

After drought-resistant sowing, if the weather continues to be dry, it is also necessary to water the seedlings to protect them. The method of watering is to insert a hole next to the seedlings with an iron rod or a wooden rod, pour water into it, and then cover the water hole with soil to maintain moisture. This method was widely adopted by the masses last year and played a significant role in resisting drought and protecting seedlings.

    察哈尔省农民防旱保墒、抗旱播种的经验
    察哈尔省人民政府农林厅
    察哈尔省每年雨量很少，并且很不均匀，特别是春末夏初干旱得非常厉害。在这种情况下，再加以这个地区十分之九的耕地是旱田，所以经常不容易做到及时播种。但是，察哈尔的农民，在当地人民政府领导下，不断和旱灾斗争，不但战胜了一九四九、一九五一两年的旱灾，并且积累了许多防旱抗旱的经验，采用了比较有效的保墒防旱、抗旱播种的方法。
    保墒防旱
    察哈尔省农民为了保墒防旱，在耕作中采用了精细整地和多搂多锄的方法。根据他们的经验，只有收墒，才能保墒；只有保墒，才能及时播种出苗。田内土壤收墒的办法，是从每年秋季开始多耕，深耕，随耕随耙、随耱。这样，土地保墒的能力随着松土层的加厚而增强。在来年的春天，如地不太干旱，还要浅耕一次和耙、耱几次。如地已干旱，就不要再耕，只能提早耙和勤耙。在播种出苗以后的保墒办法，主要是多锄，应该做到有草锄、地皮干了锄和雨后锄。赤城劳动模范杨顺奎旱地谷子丰产，就是采用这种保墒防旱的办法。他的地是耕三次、耙三次、耱三次、压一次。在年前收割后，马上浅耕（约四寸）一次，紧接双耙（每耙一遭都是沿着上遭耙过的半边起始）一次，耙后横耱、直耱各一次；霜降结冻前深耕（约五寸）一次，耕后立即耙耱一二次；来年春初地解冻约四五分时滚压一次，谷雨后播种前再浅耕一次，耙、耱各一次。苗子长出以后早锄一遍，续锄四遍。
    察哈尔省农民另外一个保墒的方法是多施用充分腐熟的、有机质的肥料。具体的作法是把每年五至十月积下的肥料（牛、猪粪、杂草、沃土等）堆积起来，加入适当的水分，使其腐熟后，在春播前上到地里。这种肥料经过腐熟，而且含有机质多，施用后既可以增加地力，又可以增加土壤收墒、保墒能力。察哈尔省劳动模范杨顺奎就是采用这种方法积肥、施肥的。
    此外，他们还有一个防旱保墒的方法，就是储水养冰，扩大春汇面积，增加土壤中的水分。
    抗旱播种
    察哈尔省农民抗旱播种的方法，一种是利用墒土适时播种，具体方法有五：（1）引耧播种：先用空耧一张，在耧脚上绑上草把，在前头先挑开干土，后边再用一个耧在露出的湿土内播种；播种后用砘子先压一次，然后再浅覆干土，以防止水分蒸发。（2）借墒播种：在冬天，把腐熟好的肥料加上适当的水分送到田里，立即用湿土封盖备用。在来年春季播种时如果墒土不好，出苗无保证时，可以把种籽和这些经过腐熟并含有水分的肥料混合播种，以增加种籽所需的水分。（3）抢墒播种：在春季地下温度达到可以使种籽发芽的温度时，提前播种；虽然这时温度低发芽慢，但根能向下深长，可增加幼苗的抗旱力。（4）半湿土播种：凡土地不太干，但播下种粒又不能保证出苗时，可以先把种子浸过，然后播到土里。
    察哈尔省农民挑水点种的方法和各地农民所习用的相仿。根据他们的经验：（1）点种的作物以豆类、玉米、高粱、花生、葵花、马铃薯为宜。（2）在点种小粒作物（谷、黍等）时，要预先定出行垅，然后顺行垅每隔五、六寸或是七、八寸挖小沟一条（沟长也是五、六寸或是七、八寸），在沟内浇水；水渗完后在沟的两端和中间撒种十至二十粒，出苗后留下三、四棵苗，留成三角形。这样小苗容易活，最后也好定苗。总的来说，不论点种大粒作物或是小粒作物，都要注意：浇水后，要等水渗完才可播种覆土；覆土后可用手轻轻拍平，或用锄推平，但切不可大力镇压或用足踏，以免湿土干后变成硬块，妨碍出苗。
    在抗旱播种之后，如天气继续干旱，还要浇苗保苗。浇的方法，可在幼苗旁用铁棍或木棍插一孔，把水灌入，然后用土把水孔盖住，以保持水分。这个方法，去年曾被群众大量采用，对抗旱保苗起了很大作用。
