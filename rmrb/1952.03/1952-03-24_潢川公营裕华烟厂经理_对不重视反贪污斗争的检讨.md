    Hunchuan Public Yu Hua Cigarette Factory Manager's Self-Criticism for Not Valuing the Anti-Corruption Struggle

    Editor: After reading the criticism in the People's Daily on February 25th that the Yu Hua Cigarette Factory manager was dealing with the anti-corruption struggle in a perfunctory manner, I realized the seriousness of my mistakes.

    After entering the city, I couldn't resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology and gradually lost the revolutionary work style of hard work and simplicity. I thought that as the manager, an old cadre, it was justifiable to eat and drink a little, and I slowly became corrupt and degenerate. I had serious bureaucratism. My work style was undemocratic, and I didn't value the workers' rational suggestions, always thinking that I knew more. This kind of thinking that didn't rely on the working class made me detached from reality and the masses. Because my thinking had been corroded by the bourgeoisie, I didn't have enough understanding and regard for the "Three-Anti" movement, which has great historical significance, and I didn't promptly launch the movement.

    In the anti-corruption struggle, I realized my mistakes. I have made these mistakes in the past, and I am sorry to the country and the people, and I am sorry to the Party and Chairman Mao. In addition to asking the higher authorities to give me the deserved punishment, I am determined to correct my mistakes in the future. Now, I have unreservedly taken the lead in "diving into the water," washing away the poisonous contamination of corruption, waste, and bureaucratism, drawing a clear line, and thoroughly transforming myself.

    Wei Jinchi, Manager of Hunchuan Public Yu Hua Cigarette Factory, Henan Province

    潢川公营裕华烟厂经理
    对不重视反贪污斗争的检讨
    编辑同志：读了人民日报二月二十五日刊载的裕华烟厂经理竟以应付态度对待反贪污斗争批评后，我认识到了我的严重错误。
    进城后，我经不起资产阶级思想的侵袭，逐渐失去了坚苦朴素的革命工作作风；以为自己是经理，是老干部，吃点喝点是应该的，慢慢地就腐化堕落起来。我是有严重的官僚主义的，我作风不民主，不重视工人的合理化建议，总以为自己懂得多。这种不依靠工人阶级的思想，使我脱离了实际，脱离了群众。由于我的思想已被资产阶级所腐蚀，因此，我对具有伟大历史意义的“三反”运动，就没有足够的认识和重视，没有及时地把运动开展起来。
    在反贪污斗争中，我才认识到我的错误。我过去犯了这些错误，对不起国家和人民，对不起党和毛主席。除了请示上级给予应得处分外，我今后下决心要痛改前非。现在，我已毫无顾虑地亲自带头下水，洗除所沾染的贪污、浪费、官僚主义的污毒，划清界限，彻底改造自己。
    河南省潢川公营裕华烟厂经理  韦金池
