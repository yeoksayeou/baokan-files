Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 28th: The journalist group composed of Beijing's Chinese and foreign journalists, after investigating the crimes of bacteriological warfare by American imperialism in Northeast China, departed from Shenyang by train on the afternoon of the 27th to return to Beijing.

During their stay in Northeast China, the journalist group inspected the evidence of the American aggressors spreading bacteria-carrying insects and poisonous substances in Fushun, Andong, Kuandian, Shenyang and other places. On the 24th, when the group went to Louhetao, east of Kuandian City, to inspect the bacteriological bombs dropped by American military aircraft, they witnessed two American aircraft intruding over Andong City and spreading bacteria-laden bird feathers in the Liudaogou area. On the 25th, the group immediately went to the scene for investigation and confirmed the American aggressors' unscrupulous continuation of the bloody crime of bacteriological warfare.

On the morning of the 26th, after returning to Shenyang from Andong, the journalist group conducted interviews in groups. On the 27th, they visited the "Exhibition of Evidence of American Imperialism Conducting Bacteriological Warfare in Northeast China."
