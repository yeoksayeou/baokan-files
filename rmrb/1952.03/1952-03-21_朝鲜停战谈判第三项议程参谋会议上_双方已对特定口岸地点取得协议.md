Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, March 20th. On March 20th, at the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item of the Korean Armistice Talks, our staff, at the request of the other side, further clarified our proposal of March 5th. They emphasized that our proposal was made on the premise that the other side, like us, has the sincerity to solve the problem. If the other side still confuses the prisoners of war we once held with the prisoners of war we currently hold at the staff meeting, we can only believe that the other side has no sincere intention to solve the problem seriously, and fundamentally destroys the premise of our March 5th proposal. Our staff further pointed out that our March 5th proposal puts forward practical and feasible specific steps that are sufficient to solve the existing problems in the fourth agenda item. It is a positive and reasonable plan, and a definite step forward in solving the fourth agenda item.

At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, both sides agreed to designate Sinuiju, Chongjin, Hungnam, Manpo, and Sinanju as our specific ports; and Busan, Incheon, Gangneung, Gunsan, and Daegu as the other side's specific ports. The specific scope of each specific port and the points of entry included will be determined when each specific port is specifically delineated.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上
    双方已对特定口岸地点取得协议
    【新华社开城二十日电】二十日朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程参谋会议上，我方参谋应对方请求，就我方三月五日建议加以进一步的阐明。并着重指出，我方这一建议是在对方如我方一样也具有解决问题的诚意的前提下提出的。如对方在参谋会议上仍将我方所曾收容过的战俘，与我方目前所收容的战俘混为一谈，我方只能认为对方尚无认真解决问题的诚意，根本破坏了我方三月五日建议的前提。我方参谋并进一步指出，我方三月五日的建议提出了切实可行的具体步骤，足可以解决第四项议程中的现存问题，是积极而合理的方案，是在解决第四项议程中确定地向前进了一步。
    第三项议程参谋会议上双方协议以新义州、清津、兴南、满浦、新安州为我方特定口岸；以釜山、仁川、江陵、群山、大邱为对方特定口岸。各特定口岸的具体范围与其所包括的进口点，将在具体划定每一特定口岸时，予以确定。
