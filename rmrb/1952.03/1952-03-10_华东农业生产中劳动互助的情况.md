The Organization and Development of Labor Mutual Aid

In various areas, mutual aid groups generally emerged during the busy farming seasons, but some were also organized to combat natural disasters and, during the war, to overcome the contradictions between supporting the front lines and production.

In the early stages of organizing mutual aid in various areas, the following three methods were generally adopted:

The first method was initiated by leaders who mobilized district and township cadres to form groups household by household and register them door-to-door. This was a relatively common method in new areas when starting to organize labor mutual aid. Using this method, because the ideological issues of the masses were not carefully resolved in advance, it often became a matter of formalism. For example, in some places in northern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang, there were formalistic tendencies such as "forming groups household by household, ringing the bell to get up, blowing the whistle to assemble, standing in line to divide the work, and starting to work when the red flag was planted." As a result, the masses were not enthusiastic, and with too many people doing different things, they did not do the work well, wasting the masses' production time. These mutual aid groups collapsed quickly. Some mutual aid groups organized using this method were rectified and became genuine. Having discovered the shortcomings, they immediately focused on rectification, cultivated activists, persuaded the masses, and reorganized according to the principle of voluntariness. However, such situations were few.

The second method was initiated by leaders who first made appeals, and then labor models and activists took the lead in responding and organizing. Many areas adopted this method for organization. The method was to convene labor model conferences, where education on organizing was conducted, and labor models were mobilized to go back and take the lead in organizing mutual aid. Provinces and regions such as Zhejiang, Fujian, and southern Jiangsu did this, and indeed organized many mutual aid groups. The Lü Hongbin mutual aid group in Shandong and the Chen Weifang mutual aid group in northern Jiangsu were also organized under these circumstances. This method had better backbones as the core of the mutual aid group from the beginning, making it easier to consolidate. However, because these backbones lacked experience, many unreasonable things may have occurred when they started organizing. For example, the Chen Weifang mutual aid group initially counted all men as full laborers and all women as half laborers, which affected women's enthusiasm for production. Therefore, the leadership must keep a close watch and correct unreasonable things in a timely manner for the mutual aid group to be consolidated.

The third method was for the county and district Party committees to send working groups to select key villages, conduct investigations and research first, find activists, and further organize the masses on the basis of existing mutual aid habits. Generally speaking, this method can be successful as long as the working group itself does not make mistakes.

In areas where leading cadres lack experience in organizing mutual aid, it is best to adopt the third method in order to gain experience and set up banners. In areas where there is already a foundation for organizing mutual aid groups and preliminary experience in organizing mutual aid, the second method should be adopted in order to further promote the movement. As for the first method, because it hinders production, it must be effectively avoided in all areas.

When adopting the second or third method to organize mutual aid groups, some difficulties will inevitably be encountered at the beginning, but there are also many favorable conditions.

The most basic is that the masses demand to be organized. Due to the seasonality of agricultural production, many farm tasks must be rushed; due to the backwardness of agricultural production technology and the differences in production techniques, labor strength, and the ability to use tools among farmers, farmers have no choice but to engage in mutual aid in production; in the past, farmers also had mutual aid habits and demanded improvements to the unreasonable phenomena in past mutual aid; there is also a need for adjustments in labor, farm tools, and draught animals; after land reform, farmers' enthusiasm for production has increased, and they are more eager to organize to overcome difficulties, improve technology, and increase production; these are all favorable conditions for organizing mutual aid and cooperation.

However, farmers also have different concerns about organizing, and if these are not eliminated in a timely manner, they will seriously affect the development and consolidation of mutual aid groups. According to reports from various areas, poor peasants are eager to engage in mutual aid, but they are afraid that after organizing, they will not be free to sell their labor, that they will not be paid in cash for their work, that their work will be done late, and that everyone will be selfish and do other people's work poorly, thus reducing yields. Middle peasants have more concerns than poor peasants, fearing that poor peasants will use their cattle and farm tools for free, or not take care of them and break them; fearing that the work will not be done well with many people together, and it would be better to work alone; fearing that there will not be many benefits from organizing, but they will have to find work outside. Farmers with weak labor are afraid that they will not be able to keep up after mutual aid.

In addition, grassroots cadres also have erroneous ideas such as "fear of trouble and fear of taking the lead." The old capitalist ideas of some farmers and cadres further affect the organization of mutual aid groups. A jingle said by a cadre in a certain township in the seventh district of Jidong County, Shandong, can very well represent the thoughts of some cadres and farmers: "Mutual aid groups are troublesome, farming is not guaranteed, paying cash is not cost-effective, it is better to hire a worker to obey orders, you can't tell him to plow shallower even if you want him to plow deeper, and he's happy to take a handful of grain."

When starting to organize mutual aid in various areas, the following methods were generally adopted:

1.  First, understand the difficulties of local farmers in developing agricultural production and the original forms of mutual aid in the local area.

2.  Consciously select and cultivate activists among farmers with difficulties in production conditions, promote them to take the lead, and publicize to the masses, making them the backbone of organizing the masses for mutual aid.

3.  Through labor model conferences, farmer representative conferences, and other meetings, widely publicize the benefits of labor mutual aid to the masses, creating public opinion for organizing. In order to facilitate the acceptance of the masses, some places start by summarizing the benefits of the original mutual aid organizations and pointing out the unreasonable aspects that need to be improved, inspiring the masses to further organize.

4.  Start organizing by solving current production difficulties, and then gradually expand the scope of mutual aid, from partial mutual aid to comprehensive mutual aid. In the process of gradual expansion, pay special attention to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit, allowing mutual aid during busy times and dispersion during idle times, mutual aid for big jobs and individual work for small jobs, so that all participating members benefit and do not suffer losses. Experience has shown that rushing into things or one-sidedly emphasizing the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers, or one-sidedly emphasizing the interests of households with cattle and carts, will cause adverse consequences.

5.  In terms of organizational scale, generally start from small to large, from three or five households, or divide into smaller groups within larger groups. Avoid the tendency of "mass action" at the beginning.

6.  Some rural areas have also taken the following measures as auxiliary methods for transitioning to labor mutual aid: ? In disaster areas or areas with more people and less land, start by organizing sideline mutual aid and gradually move towards comprehensive mutual aid combining agriculture and sideline occupations. ? Start by organizing to cultivate land on behalf of revolutionary martyrs' families and gradually move towards labor mutual aid between farmers. ? Organize labor mutual aid on the basis of farmers jointly using draught cattle and large farm tools lent by the government. ? Develop from voluntary help based on personal relationships to mutual aid groups based on equivalent exchange. ? Expand the membership and improve the mutual aid methods by using the original organizations such as "joint plowing" and "partnerships."

The basic link in the development of labor mutual aid from point to surface is to first do a good job of some good typical groups, so that the farmers participating in the mutual aid groups can truly get some benefits. Then summarize the work of these mutual aid groups and mobilize nearby farmers to participate in the summary meeting. This can not only educate the farmers who have already participated and improve their understanding, but also allow the farmers who have already participated to speak from experience, reporting the benefits and experiences of organizing, and educating nearby farmers. In addition, model mutual aid groups can also challenge farmers or mutual aid groups in surrounding districts and townships to conduct production competitions; in the competitions, discover new activists, brew and generate new mutual aid groups.

Consolidation and Improvement of Labor Mutual Aid

The development, consolidation, and improvement of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation must be based on a solid foundation at the beginning. It should be organized step by step according to the principles of voluntary association, equivalent exchange, and democratic management, based on local conditions, production needs, and mass habits. The methods of "patient persuasion" and "typical demonstration" must be adopted, and coercion and commandism are absolutely not allowed. The development law of mutual aid groups should be from small to large, from low to high, from temporary to fixed; it should start with major labor mutual aid during the busy farming season, and gradually combine it with overcoming natural disasters, developing sideline occupations, improving production technology, and preparing for the busy farming season during the slack season, so as to gradually overcome the seasonal restrictions on agricultural production and make the mutual aid group a long-term and fixed organization. At present, there are several relatively consolidated mutual aid groups in various places; these mutual aid groups have also experienced several storms in their development. The reasons why some mutual aid groups have collapsed are generally: (1) The production conditions between the farmers participating in mutual aid are different, such as differences in labor strength, the number of production tools, the timing of cultivation, the distance of the land, and the quality of meals. The contradictions arising from these differences have not been resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. (2) The economic life of individual farmers has improved, but our political work has not kept up, the farmers' political awareness has not been further improved, and the idea of working alone has raised its head. (3) Due to the continued development of production, farmers have the need to break through the current production situation, but the mutual aid group is still at the stage of hoeing the land one more time and applying one more cart of manure. The surplus labor force cannot be properly resolved, so the content of mutual aid cannot meet the needs of farmers. (4) The mutual aid group itself lacks a strong leading backbone, and the leadership lacks regular and sound guidance.

To further consolidate and develop mutual aid groups in the future, the following issues must be resolved:

(1) The issue of equivalent value: Equivalent exchange is the basis for protecting the economic interests of farmers, encouraging their enthusiasm for production, and consolidating mutual aid groups. This does not mean that the members of the mutual aid group must necessarily be "soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals" in order to achieve fairness and rationality (it is precisely because farmers have different production conditions that it is necessary to organize mutual aid), but that after organizing, it is necessary to basically achieve equivalent exchange in several major links and achieve "mutual benefit." The method of equivalent value should be adapted to local conditions and decided by the farmers themselves through democratic discussion. Localities should not force uniformity, nor should cadres subjectively set out a set of overly complex calculation methods. According to Shandong's experience, it should basically be achieved:

? Rational use of labor: Determine work points through democratic appraisal based on different situations such as labor strength, labor efficiency, labor type, and labor technology; specifically stipulate wages according to the busy and slack seasons; equal pay for equal work for men and women; settle work accounts at the field head every day; flexibly divide work according to each person's skills, give full play to each person's strengths, and rationally use labor, preventing labor waste; the wage within the group should not be too high or too low compared to the market price. ? Rational use of farm tools: Large farm tools (such as plows, harrows, waterwheels, etc.) are purchased, used, and repaired jointly by contributing money according to the amount of land. Private farm tools are either put in the group for shared use and "valued according to condition" (i.e., paying depreciation fees), repaired jointly if damaged, or borrowed temporarily to offset labor. ? Rational use of draught cattle: One method is to buy cattle jointly by contributing money according to the amount of land and allocating feed according to the quality and amount of land. A dedicated person is responsible for feeding (the feeder records points), and a dedicated person (who knows how to use cattle) uses them. Cattle manure is distributed according to the land. Another method is for private cattle to offset labor within the group.

In implementing equivalent exchange, attention must be paid to the issue of equal pay for equal work for men and women, and the special difficulties faced by women participating in labor production must be resolved, and nurseries should be established during the busy farming season. Women responsible for nurseries during the busy farming season should also be properly credited or given necessary rewards to give full play to the productive enthusiasm of the broad masses of women.

Generally speaking, after the "equivalent value" problem is solved, the enthusiasm of both male and female farmers for improving technology, improving varieties, and purchasing new farm tools can be fully exerted; with jointly purchased and used draught animals and farm tools, mutual aid groups are easier to consolidate.

(2) Strengthen technical guidance to mutual aid groups. Increasing the yield per unit area and increasing income so that farmers participating in mutual aid groups can benefit are the material foundations for consolidating mutual aid groups. To increase the yield per unit area, it is necessary to build water conservancy, increase fertilizer application, select and breed good varieties, improve soil, increase and supplement farm tools, promote new farm tools, cultivate meticulously, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests. In short, it is necessary to adopt advanced scientific farming methods and change backward and conservative production habits. Mutual aid groups have more people and wisdom, and coupled with increased labor efficiency and concentrated production funds, they are more likely to accept technical guidance than individual farmers; and after mutual aid groups adopt advanced farming methods, they further provide an outlet for surplus labor and accumulated funds, which can further consolidate mutual aid organizations. In conducting technical guidance, the principle of combining scientific knowledge with farmers' experience should be implemented. The technical promotion networks and technical training classes of farms in various parts of Shandong, the establishment of agricultural production technology guidance committees in some villages and towns, the establishment of agricultural production technology research groups in villages, and other methods such as old farmers' forums, slide propaganda, labor models reporting production experience, labor model forums, and "taking farms as bases, mutual aid groups as the foundation, and labor models as the backbone to launch a mutual teaching and learning movement" can all be used when conducting technical guidance to mutual aid groups.

(3) Developing marketable sideline production is the basic method to solve the problem of surplus labor and to gradually transform temporary and seasonal mutual aid groups into fixed and year-round mutual aid groups. In some places, the content of mutual aid has increased and the mutual aid organization has expanded and consolidated because the sideline occupations have been done well and further combined with supply and marketing; in other places, agricultural mutual aid has been consolidated and agricultural investment has been expanded because the sideline occupations have been done well. At present, the several forms of combining sideline occupations are: ① engaging in farming during the busy farming season and engaging in sideline occupations during the slack season; ② focusing on agriculture and maintaining sideline occupations during the busy farming season; ③ in areas with a high population density and little land, appropriately dividing labor and carrying out agricultural and sideline occupations simultaneously. In short, various forms of sideline production organizations should be established based on different production conditions, different production content, and the original foundations in various places. Speculative commercial activities should be prevented in the operation of sideline production. Experience has shown that mutual aid groups engaged in commercial speculation are bound to go to the point of collapse.

(4) The issue of democratic management. Promote democracy in production planning, production management, and ideological leadership. Plans should be discussed by everyone, and rules and discipline should be decided by everyone. All those who have done this have generally been able to consolidate. For example, the covenant of the Jia Huibang mutual aid group states: Discuss everything together, do not haggle over food and drink, do not delay in returning labor, and do not be careless in work. The Cao Xubao group in Kunyu stipulates: Meet briefly every evening, hold a small group meeting every five days, settle accounts every ten days, and find out the grain every quarter. The Lü Hongbin group not only achieved the three major rationalizations in the use of labor, draught cattle, and farm tools, but also grasped the three key points of mutual aid groups that are prone to collapse due to the strong seasonality of rushing to harvest wheat, harvesting and planting beans, and rushing to hoe the fire-colored land (land that dries easily), and resolved them through timely democratic consultation. The Luo Tengyun group has a system of criticism and self-criticism of "comparing benefits, calculating achievements, and checking shortcomings."

(5) Strengthen political education for members of mutual aid groups to improve their ideological awareness. The content of education should include patriotism, the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, selflessness, the benefits of organizing, and the future of agricultural development, so that farmers participating in mutual aid groups can correctly understand the relationship between "patriotic production increase" and "labor to get rich," closely integrate daily production activities with the political tasks of building a new China, so that members of mutual aid groups can see the benefits of organizing and see their bright future under the leadership of the working class, thereby eliminating conservative and backward ideas, demanding themselves with higher production increase requirements, and continuously improving their production enthusiasm. The method of education can be through winter schools, combined with people's schools, and establishing a newspaper reading system to study current affairs and politics. Where conditions permit, representatives can be recommended to visit factories, visit mechanical farms, and launch workers and farmers to communicate with each other.

(6) Cultivate labor models in mutual aid groups, enrich the backbone, and cultivate model mutual aid groups, production base villages, and production demonstration townships within the scope of a township, a district, or a county as the base points of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the process of cultivation, the production time of labor models and model mutual aid groups should be cherished, and tasks that they are not capable of should not be assigned to them. After labor models, model groups, etc. are formed, their experiences should be well promoted so that they can play a demonstrative role among the broad masses. When promoting experience, it should first be done in the local township so that they can continue to move forward under the supervision and promotion of the local masses, so as not to produce the result of "focusing on the distant and not the near."

(7) Establish various systems for leading mutual aid groups, establish the correct relationship between mutual aid groups and cooperative societies, banks, trade, and other departments, and national economic departments should vigorously support mutual aid groups so that mutual aid groups can continue to develop.

After the mutual aid groups are consolidated and developed, some mutual aid groups have rich experience and relatively strong leading backbones, and members have higher requirements, agricultural production cooperatives should be gradually developed in a planned, led, and focused manner, guiding the broad masses of farmers to the path of collectivization step by step.

    华东农业生产中劳动互助的情况
    中共中央华东局农村工作委员会农业互助研究组
    （续昨）
    劳动互助的组织和发展
    各地互助组，一般都是在农忙时产生的，但也有为了战胜灾荒以及在战争时期为了克服支援前线和生产的矛盾组织起来的。
    各地在组织互助的初期，大体采用了以下三种办法：
    第一种是领导方面号召，区乡干部按居民组挨户编组，登门造册。这在新区开始组织劳动互助时是比较普遍的方式。采用这种方式，由于事先没有细致地解决群众的思想问题，往往流于形式主义。如皖北、苏南、山东和浙江的个别地方，都发生过“挨户编组，敲钟起床，吹哨集合，站队分工，红旗一插，大家劳动”的形式主义偏向。结果是群众情绪不高，人多手杂，反而做不好活，浪费了群众的生产时间。这种互助组，垮得很快。用这种方法组织起来的互助组，也有经过整理弄假成真的。由于发现了缺点，立即有重点地整理，培养积极分子，说服群众，按照自愿原则，重新组织起来。但这种情形为数不多。
    第二种是领导方面先作号召，然后由劳动模范积极分子带头响应，组织起来的。各地采用这种方式进行组织的较多。方法是召开劳动模范会，在会上进行组织起来的教育，动员劳动模范回去带头组织互助。浙江、福建、苏南等省区这样做了，确实组织起不少的互助组。山东吕鸿宾互助组，苏北陈维芳互助组，也都是在这种情况下组织起来的。这种方式一上来就有较好的骨干做互助组的核心，比较容易巩固。但由于这些骨干分子缺乏经验，开始组织时也可能发生很多不合理的地方。如陈维芳互助组开头把男人一律算全劳动力，妇女一律算半劳动力，影响了妇女的生产积极性。因此，领导上必须抓得紧，及时纠正不合理的地方，互助组才能巩固起来。
    第三种方式是党的县委区委派出工作组，选择基点村，先进行调查研究，物色积极分子，在原有的互助习惯基础上，把群众进一步组织起来。一般说，这种方式，只要工作组本身不犯错误，是可以搞得好的。
    在领导干部没有组织互助经验的地区，为了吸取经验，树立旗帜，最好采用第三种方式。在已有互助组组织基础且有了初步组织互助的经验的地区，为了进一步把运动推开，应当采用第二种方式。至于第一种方式，因为会妨碍生产，不论何种地区，都必须切实避免。
    在采用第二种或第三种方式组织互助组时，开头必然会遇到一些困难，但也有很多的有利条件。
    最基本的是群众要求组织起来。由于农业生产的季节性，很多农活要抢着做；由于农业生产技术还很落后，及各个农民生产技术有高低，劳动力有强弱，使用工具有会与不会，使农民在生产中非互助不行；过去农民也有互助习惯，对过去互助中的不合理现象，要求改进；在劳动力、农具和耕畜上，也有调剂的必要；土地改革后，农民生产积极性提高，更迫切要求组织起来，克服困难，提高技术，增加生产；这些，都是组织互助合作的有利条件。
    但农民们对组织起来也有不同的顾虑，如不及时予以消除，就会严重地影响互助组的发展和巩固。各地反映，贫农是迫切要求互助的，但怕组织起来后，出卖劳动力不自由，怕做了活拿不到现钱，怕自己的活做得晚，怕大家有私心，把人家的活做坏，因而产量降低。中农的顾虑比贫农更多，怕贫农白使耕牛农具，或不爱护耕牛农具，出劲用，用坏了；怕人多合在一起活做不好，不如自己单干来得好；怕组织起来好处不多，反要向外找工钱。劳动力不强的农民则怕互助以后，拖不了，吃不消。
    此外，基层干部也有“怕麻烦，怕带头”等错误思想。部分农民及干部旧的资本主义思想，更影响了互助组的组织工作。山东即东县七区某乡干部说的一段顺口溜，很能代表一部分干部和农民的思想：“互助组找麻烦，作庄稼不保险，掏现钱不合算，宁愿雇个工听使唤，叫耕深不敢浅，拿把粮也心甘。”
    各地在开始组织互助时，大体上采取了以下办法：
    一、首先了解当地农民在发展农业生产中的困难，及当地原有的互助形式。
    二、在生产条件上有困难的农民中，有意识地选择、培养积极分子，推动他们带头，向群众进行宣传，成为组织群众进行互助的骨干。
    三、通过劳动模范大会、农民代表会等各种会议，广泛地向群众宣传劳动互助的好处，造成组织起来的舆论。为了便于群众接受，有的地方从总结原有互助组织的好处着手，并指出其中不合理、须要改进的地方，启发群众进一步组织起来的要求。
    四、从解决当前生产困难着手组织，然后逐步扩大互助范围，从局部互助进到全面互助。在逐步扩大过程中，特别抓紧自愿互利的原则，允许忙时互助，闲时分散，大活互助，小活单干，使参加的成员都有好处，互不吃亏。经验证明，在这方面犯急性病或片面强调贫雇农的利益，或片面强调有牛有车户的利益，都会造成不良的后果。
    五、为了便于掌握，在组织规模上，一般都是由小到大，从三户五户开始，或者在大组中再分成小组。在开始时切忌“大呼隆”的偏向。
    六、有些农村还采取了下列几种措施作为过渡到劳动互助的辅助办法：?在灾区或人多地少地区，从组织副业互助入手，逐渐走到农副业相结合的全面互助。?开始组织起来替烈军属代耕，逐渐进到农民与农民间的劳动互助。?运用政府贷放的耕牛和大型农具，在农民共同使用的基础上，组织劳动互助。?从义务相帮的人情工，发展成等价交换的互助组。?运用原有的“合犋”、“合伙”等组织，扩大成员，改进互助办法。
    劳动互助由点到面的发展，基本一环是首先搞好一些好的典型组，使得参加互助组的农民，都真正得到一些好处。然后总结这些互助组的工作，发动附近农民来参加总结会议。这样既可教育已参加的农民，提高他们的认识，又可由已参加的农民现身说法，报告组织起来的好处和经验，教育附近农民，此外，还可以通过模范互助组向周围区乡农民或互助组挑战，进行生产竞赛；在竞赛中，发现新的积极分子，酝酿与产生新的互助组。
    劳动互助的巩固和提高
    农业生产互助合作的发展、巩固和提高，必须在开始时便打好基础。应当根据当地条件、生产需要、群众习惯，有步骤地按照自愿结合、等价交换、民主管理等原则，进行组织。必须采取“耐心说服”和“典型示范”的方法，绝对不许强迫命令。互助组的发展规律，应是从小到大，从低级到高级，从临时性到固定性；应从农忙时主要劳动互助作起，并逐步结合战胜自然灾害、发展副业、提高生产技术，及利用农闲为农忙进行准备等，以逐渐克服农业生产上的季节性的限制，使互助组成为长期的固定的组织。现在各地都有若干比较巩固的互助组；这些互助组在发展中也曾经过若干风浪。有些互助组曾经垮台的原因一般是：（一）参加互助的各户农民之间的生产条件不同，例如劳动力有强弱、生产工具有多少、耕作时间有先后、田地有远近、吃饭有好坏等，对于从这些地方产生的矛盾，没有及时地、适当地加以解决。（二）个别农民经济生活上升了，我们的政治工作没赶上，农民的政治觉悟没有进一步提高，单干思想抬头。（三）由于生产的继续发展，农民有突破生产现状的要求，而互助组还停在多锄一遍地、多上一车粪的阶段，剩余劳动力不能适当解决，因而互助内容不能满足农民的要求。（四）互助组本身缺乏坚强的领导骨干，领导方面缺乏经常的和健全的指导。
    今后要进一步巩固和发展互助组，必须解决下列几个问题：
    （一）等价问题：等价交换，是保护农民的经济利益和鼓励农民生产积极性、巩固互助组的基础。不是说互助组的成员一定都要“兵对兵，将对将”才能做到公平合理（正因农民之间生产条件不同，才需要组织互助），而是说在组织起来后，在几个主要环节上，必须基本上做到等价交换，做到“互利”。等价的办法应因地制宜，由农民自己民主讨论决定，各地不可强求一致，也不可由干部主观地订出一套过于复杂的计算方法。根据山东的经验，基本上应做到：
    ?合理使用劳动力：按劳动力强弱、劳动效率、劳动种类、劳动技术等不同情况，采取民主评议方法，确定工分；工资按季节忙闲具体规定；男女同工同酬；每天田头结清工账；按各人技术灵活分工，发挥各人专长，合理使用劳动力，防止劳动力浪费；组内工资比市价不应过高和过低。 ?合理使用农具：大农具（如犁、耙、水车等）按地亩出钱，公买、公用、公修，私人农具，或放在组内伙用“打成色”（即偿付折旧费），用坏了公修，或临时借用顶工。 ?合理使用耕牛：一种是伙买牛，按亩出钱伙买，按地亩好坏多少出草料，专人喂养（喂养人记分），专人（会使牛的）使用，牛粪按地分。一种是私人的牛，组内用牛顶工。
    在实行等价交换中，必须注意男女同工同酬问题，并解决妇女参加劳动生产时的特殊困难，建立农忙托儿所。负责农忙托儿所的妇女，也应适当记分，或进行必要的奖励，借以发挥广大妇女的生产积极性。
    一般说，“等价”问题解决后，男女农民对改进技术、改良品种、购买新式农具等的积极性就能充分发挥；有了公买公用的耕畜农具，互助组更容易巩固。
    （二）加强对互助组的技术指导。提高单位面积产量，增加收入，使参加互助组的农民，都得到好处，是互助组巩固的物质基础。要提高单位面积产量，必须兴修水利、增施肥料、选育良种、改良土壤、增补农具、推广新式农具、精耕细作、防治病虫害。总之，必须采用先进的科学的耕作方法，改变落后的保守的生产习惯。互助组人多智广，加上劳动效率提高，生产资金集中，比单干农民容易接受技术指导；而互助组采用了先进的耕作方法后，更使剩余劳动力和积累的资金，有了出路，可进一步巩固互助组织。在进行技术指导方面，应贯彻科学知识与农民经验相结合的方针。山东各地农场的技术推广网和技术训练班，部分乡里成立农业生产技术指导委员会，村里成立农业生产技术研究小组，其他地方的老农座谈会、幻灯宣传、劳动模范报告生产经验、劳动模范座谈会，及“以农场为据点，互助组为基础，劳动模范为骨干，展开互教互学运动”等方法，在向互助组进行技术指导时都可以采用。
    （三）发展有销路的副业生产，这是目前解决剩余劳动力的出路问题，和使临时性季节性互助组逐渐转变为固定性的常年的互助组的基本方法。有些地方由于副业搞得好，并进一步结合供销，互助的内容就多了，互助组织也就扩大和巩固了；也有的由于副业搞得好巩固了农业互助，并且扩大了农业投资。目前结合副业的几种形式是：①农忙务农，农闲搞副业；②农忙时突击农业维持副业；③人稠地少，劳动力多时，适当分工，农副业同时进行。总之，应根据不同的生产条件，不同的生产内容，和各地原有的基础，建立各种不同形式的副业生产组织。在经营副业生产中应防止投机性的商业行为。经验证明，凡从事商业投机的互助组，必然要走上垮台的道路。
    （四）民主管理问题。在生产计划、生产管理、思想领导等方面发扬民主，计划由大家讨论，制度和纪律由大家决定。凡是这样做的，一般都能巩固。如贾惠邦互助组的公约：凡事大家商量，吃喝不计较，还工不拖欠，干活不马虎。昆嵛曹绪宝组规定：每晚一碰头，五天一次小组会，十天一算账，每季找清粮。吕鸿宾组不但做到了劳动力、耕牛、农具使用上的三大合理，而且抓住了互助组抢割麦子收种豆子与抢锄火色地（易干的地）的三个带有强烈季节性容易垮台的关键，及时民主协商解决。骆腾云组有“比比好处，算算成绩，查查缺点”的批评和自我批评制度。
    （五）加强对互助组组员的政治教育，提高他们的思想觉悟。教育的内容，应包括爱国主义、工人阶级领导的工农联盟、大公无私、组织起来的好处和农业发展的前途，使参加互助组的农民，正确地认识“爱国增产”和“劳动发家”的关系，把日常的生产活动，和建设新中国的政治任务密切地结合起来，使互助组组员们看到组织起来的好处，看到自己在工人阶级领导下的光明前途，从而消除保守落后思想，以更高的增产要求来要求自己，不断地提高生产积极性。教育的方式，可以通过冬学，结合民校，建立读报制度学习时事政治。有条件的地方，可以推举代表参观工厂，参观机械农场，发动工人农民相互通信。
    （六）在互助组中培养劳动模范，充实骨干，并在一个乡、一个区、一个县的范围内培养模范互助组、生产基点村、生产示范乡，作为互助合作运动的基点。在培养过程中，应十分爱护劳动模范和模范互助组的生产时间，不应交给他们力不胜任的任务。当劳动模范、模范组等形成后，应很好地推广他们的经验，使他们能在广大群众中起示范作用。在推广经验时，应首先在本乡做起，使他们能在本乡群众的监督和推动下，继续前进，不致产生“照远不照近”的结果。
    （七）建立领导互助组的各种制度，确立互助组和合作社、银行、贸易等部门的正确关系，国家经济部门应大力支持互助组，使互助组不断地向前发展。
    在互助组巩固了、发展了之后，有些互助组有了丰富的经验和比较强的领导骨干，组员又有了更高的要求时，就应该有计划有领导有重点地逐步发展农业生产合作社，一步一步地把广大农民引导到集体化的道路上去。（完）
