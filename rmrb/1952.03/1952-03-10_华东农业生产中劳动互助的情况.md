The Organization and Development of Labor Mutual Aid

In various areas, mutual aid groups generally emerged during the busy farming seasons, but some were also organized to combat natural disasters and, during the war, to overcome the contradictions between supporting the front lines and production.

In the early stages of organizing mutual aid in various areas, the following three methods were generally adopted:

The first method was initiated by leaders who mobilized district and township cadres to form groups household by household and register them door-to-door. This was a relatively common method in new areas when starting to organize labor mutual aid. Using this method, because the ideological issues of the masses were not carefully resolved in advance, it often became a matter of formalism. For example, in some places in northern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang, there were formalistic tendencies such as "forming groups household by household, ringing the bell to get up, blowing the whistle to assemble, standing in line to divide the work, and starting to work when the red flag was planted." As a result, the masses were not enthusiastic, and with too many people doing different things, they did not do the work well, wasting the masses' production time. These mutual aid groups collapsed quickly. Some mutual aid groups organized using this method were rectified and became genuine. Having discovered the shortcomings, they immediately focused on rectification, cultivated activists, persuaded the masses, and reorganized according to the principle of voluntariness. However, such situations were few.

The second method was initiated by leaders who first made appeals, and then labor models and activists took the lead in responding and organizing. Many areas adopted this method for organization. The method was to convene labor model conferences, where education on organizing was conducted, and labor models were mobilized to go back and take the lead in organizing mutual aid. Provinces and regions such as Zhejiang, Fujian, and southern Jiangsu did this, and indeed organized many mutual aid groups. The LÃ¼ Hongbin mutual aid group in Shandong and the Chen Weifang mutual aid group in northern Jiangsu were also organized under these circumstances. This method had better backbones as the core of the mutual aid group from the beginning, making it easier to consolidate. However, because these backbones lacked experience, many unreasonable things may have occurred when they started organizing. For example, the Chen Weifang mutual aid group initially counted all men as full laborers and all women as half laborers, which affected women's enthusiasm for production. Therefore, the leadership must keep a close watch and correct unreasonable things in a timely manner for the mutual aid group to be consolidated.

The third method was for the county and district Party committees to send working groups to select key villages, conduct investigations and research first, find activists, and further organize the masses on the basis of existing mutual aid habits. Generally speaking, this method can be successful as long as the working group itself does not make mistakes.

In areas where leading cadres lack experience in organizing mutual aid, it is best to adopt the third method in order to gain experience and set up banners. In areas where there is already a foundation for organizing mutual aid groups and preliminary experience in organizing mutual aid, the second method should be adopted in order to further promote the movement. As for the first method, because it hinders production, it must be effectively avoided in all areas.

When adopting the second or third method to organize mutual aid groups, some difficulties will inevitably be encountered at the beginning, but there are also many favorable conditions.

The most basic is that the masses demand to be organized. Due to the seasonality of agricultural production, many farm tasks must be rushed; due to the backwardness of agricultural production technology and the differences in production techniques, labor strength, and the ability to use tools among farmers, farmers have no choice but to engage in mutual aid in production; in the past, farmers also had mutual aid habits and demanded improvements to the unreasonable phenomena in past mutual aid; there is also a need for adjustments in labor, farm tools, and draught animals; after land reform, farmers' enthusiasm for production has increased, and they are more eager to organize to overcome difficulties, improve technology, and increase production; these are all favorable conditions for organizing mutual aid and cooperation.

However, farmers also have different concerns about organizing, and if these are not eliminated in a timely manner, they will seriously affect the development and consolidation of mutual aid groups. According to reports from various areas, poor peasants are eager to engage in mutual aid, but they are afraid that after organizing, they will not be free to sell their labor, that they will not be paid in cash for their work, that their work will be done late, and that everyone will be selfish and do other people's work poorly, thus reducing yields. Middle peasants have more concerns than poor peasants, fearing that poor peasants will use their cattle and farm tools for free, or not take care of them and break them; fearing that the work will not be done well with many people together, and it would be better to work alone; fearing that there will not be many benefits from organizing, but they will have to find work outside. Farmers with weak labor are afraid that they will not be able to keep up after mutual aid.

In addition, grassroots cadres also have erroneous ideas such as "fear of trouble and fear of taking the lead." The old capitalist ideas of some farmers and cadres further affect the organization of mutual aid groups. A jingle said by a cadre in a certain township in the seventh district of Jidong County, Shandong, can very well represent the thoughts of some cadres and farmers: "Mutual aid groups are troublesome, farming is not guaranteed, paying cash is not cost-effective, it is better to hire a worker to obey orders, you can't tell him to plow shallower even if you want him to plow deeper, and he's happy to take a handful of grain."

When starting to organize mutual aid in various areas, the following methods were generally adopted:

1.  First, understand the difficulties of local farmers in developing agricultural production and the original forms of mutual aid in the local area.

2.  Consciously select and cultivate activists among farmers with difficulties in production conditions, promote them to take the lead, and publicize to the masses, making them the backbone of organizing the masses for mutual aid.

3.  Through labor model conferences, farmer representative conferences, and other meetings, widely publicize the benefits of labor mutual aid to the masses, creating public opinion for organizing. In order to facilitate the acceptance of the masses, some places start by summarizing the benefits of the original mutual aid organizations and pointing out the unreasonable aspects that need to be improved, inspiring the masses to further organize.

4.  Start organizing by solving current production difficulties, and then gradually expand the scope of mutual aid, from partial mutual aid to comprehensive mutual aid. In the process of gradual expansion, pay special attention to the principles of voluntary mutual benefit, allowing mutual aid during busy times and dispersion during idle times, mutual aid for big jobs and individual work for small jobs, so that all participating members benefit and do not suffer losses. Experience has shown that rushing into things or one-sidedly emphasizing the interests of poor peasants and hired laborers, or one-sidedly emphasizing the interests of households with cattle and carts, will cause adverse consequences.

5.  In terms of organizational scale, generally start from small to large, from three or five households, or divide into smaller groups within larger groups. Avoid the tendency of "mass action" at the beginning.

6.  Some rural areas have also taken the following measures as auxiliary methods for transitioning to labor mutual aid: ? In disaster areas or areas with more people and less land, start by organizing sideline mutual aid and gradually move towards comprehensive mutual aid combining agriculture and sideline occupations. ? Start by organizing to cultivate land on behalf of revolutionary martyrs' families and gradually move towards labor mutual aid between farmers. ? Organize labor mutual aid on the basis of farmers jointly using draught cattle and large farm tools lent by the government. ? Develop from voluntary help based on personal relationships to mutual aid groups based on equivalent exchange. ? Expand the membership and improve the mutual aid methods by using the original organizations such as "joint plowing" and "partnerships."

The basic link in the development of labor mutual aid from point to surface is to first do a good job of some good typical groups, so that the farmers participating in the mutual aid groups can truly get some benefits. Then summarize the work of these mutual aid groups and mobilize nearby farmers to participate in the summary meeting. This can not only educate the farmers who have already participated and improve their understanding, but also allow the farmers who have already participated to speak from experience, reporting the benefits and experiences of organizing, and educating nearby farmers. In addition, model mutual aid groups can also challenge farmers or mutual aid groups in surrounding districts and townships to conduct production competitions; in the competitions, discover new activists, brew and generate new mutual aid groups.

Consolidation and Improvement of Labor Mutual Aid

The development, consolidation, and improvement of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation must be based on a solid foundation at the beginning. It should be organized step by step according to the principles of voluntary association, equivalent exchange, and democratic management, based on local conditions, production needs, and mass habits. The methods of "patient persuasion" and "typical demonstration" must be adopted, and coercion and commandism are absolutely not allowed. The development law of mutual aid groups should be from small to large, from low to high, from temporary to fixed; it should start with major labor mutual aid during the busy farming season, and gradually combine it with overcoming natural disasters, developing sideline occupations, improving production technology, and preparing for the busy farming season during the slack season, so as to gradually overcome the seasonal restrictions on agricultural production and make the mutual aid group a long-term and fixed organization. At present, there are several relatively consolidated mutual aid groups in various places; these mutual aid groups have also experienced several storms in their development. The reasons why some mutual aid groups have collapsed are generally: (1) The production conditions between the farmers participating in mutual aid are different, such as differences in labor strength, the number of production tools, the timing of cultivation, the distance of the land, and the quality of meals. The contradictions arising from these differences have not been resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. (2) The economic life of individual farmers has improved, but our political work has not kept up, the farmers' political awareness has not been further improved, and the idea of working alone has raised its head. (3) Due to the continued development of production, farmers have the need to break through the current production situation, but the mutual aid group is still at the stage of hoeing the land one more time and applying one more cart of manure. The surplus labor force cannot be properly resolved, so the content of mutual aid cannot meet the needs of farmers. (4) The mutual aid group itself lacks a strong leading backbone, and the leadership lacks regular and sound guidance.

To further consolidate and develop mutual aid groups in the future, the following issues must be resolved:

(1) The issue of equivalent value: Equivalent exchange is the basis for protecting the economic interests of farmers, encouraging their enthusiasm for production, and consolidating mutual aid groups. This does not mean that the members of the mutual aid group must necessarily be "soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals" in order to achieve fairness and rationality (it is precisely because farmers have different production conditions that it is necessary to organize mutual aid), but that after organizing, it is necessary to basically achieve equivalent exchange in several major links and achieve "mutual benefit." The method of equivalent value should be adapted to local conditions and decided by the farmers themselves through democratic discussion. Localities should not force uniformity, nor should cadres subjectively set out a set of overly complex calculation methods. According to Shandong's experience, it should basically be achieved:

? Rational use of labor: Determine work points through democratic appraisal based on different situations such as labor strength, labor efficiency, labor type, and labor technology; specifically stipulate wages according to the busy and slack seasons; equal pay for equal work for men and women; settle work accounts at the field head every day; flexibly divide work according to each person's skills, give full play to each person's strengths, and rationally use labor, preventing labor waste; the wage within the group should not be too high or too low compared to the market price. ? Rational use of farm tools: Large farm tools (such as plows, harrows, waterwheels, etc.) are purchased, used, and repaired jointly by contributing money according to the amount of land. Private farm tools are either put in the group for shared use and "valued according to condition" (i.e., paying depreciation fees), repaired jointly if damaged, or borrowed temporarily to offset labor. ? Rational use of draught cattle: One method is to buy cattle jointly by contributing money according to the amount of land and allocating feed according to the quality and amount of land. A dedicated person is responsible for feeding (the feeder records points), and a dedicated person (who knows how to use cattle) uses them. Cattle manure is distributed according to the land. Another method is for private cattle to offset labor within the group.

In implementing equivalent exchange, attention must be paid to the issue of equal pay for equal work for men and women, and the special difficulties faced by women participating in labor production must be resolved, and nurseries should be established during the busy farming season. Women responsible for nurseries during the busy farming season should also be properly credited or given necessary rewards to give full play to the productive enthusiasm of the broad masses of women.

Generally speaking, after the "equivalent value" problem is solved, the enthusiasm of both male and female farmers for improving technology, improving varieties, and purchasing new farm tools can be fully exerted; with jointly purchased and used draught animals and farm tools, mutual aid groups are easier to consolidate.

(2) Strengthen technical guidance to mutual aid groups. Increasing the yield per unit area and increasing income so that farmers participating in mutual aid groups can benefit are the material foundations for consolidating mutual aid groups. To increase the yield per unit area, it is necessary to build water conservancy, increase fertilizer application, select and breed good varieties, improve soil, increase and supplement farm tools, promote new farm tools, cultivate meticulously, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests. In short, it is necessary to adopt advanced scientific farming methods and change backward and conservative production habits. Mutual aid groups have more people and wisdom, and coupled with increased labor efficiency and concentrated production funds, they are more likely to accept technical guidance than individual farmers; and after mutual aid groups adopt advanced farming methods, they further provide an outlet for surplus labor and accumulated funds, which can further consolidate mutual aid organizations. In conducting technical guidance, the principle of combining scientific knowledge with farmers' experience should be implemented. The technical promotion networks and technical training classes of farms in various parts of Shandong, the establishment of agricultural production technology guidance committees in some villages and towns, the establishment of agricultural production technology research groups in villages, and other methods such as old farmers' forums, slide propaganda, labor models reporting production experience, labor model forums, and "taking farms as bases, mutual aid groups as the foundation, and labor models as the backbone to launch a mutual teaching and learning movement" can all be used when conducting technical guidance to mutual aid groups.

(3) Developing marketable sideline production is the basic method to solve the problem of surplus labor and to gradually transform temporary and seasonal mutual aid groups into fixed and year-round mutual aid groups. In some places, the content of mutual aid has increased and the mutual aid organization has expanded and consolidated because the sideline occupations have been done well and further combined with supply and marketing; in other places, agricultural mutual aid has been consolidated and agricultural investment has been expanded because the sideline occupations have been done well. At present, the several forms of combining sideline occupations are: â  engaging in farming during the busy farming season and engaging in sideline occupations during the slack season; â¡ focusing on agriculture and maintaining sideline occupations during the busy farming season; â¢ in areas with a high population density and little land, appropriately dividing labor and carrying out agricultural and sideline occupations simultaneously. In short, various forms of sideline production organizations should be established based on different production conditions, different production content, and the original foundations in various places. Speculative commercial activities should be prevented in the operation of sideline production. Experience has shown that mutual aid groups engaged in commercial speculation are bound to go to the point of collapse.

(4) The issue of democratic management. Promote democracy in production planning, production management, and ideological leadership. Plans should be discussed by everyone, and rules and discipline should be decided by everyone. All those who have done this have generally been able to consolidate. For example, the covenant of the Jia Huibang mutual aid group states: Discuss everything together, do not haggle over food and drink, do not delay in returning labor, and do not be careless in work. The Cao Xubao group in Kunyu stipulates: Meet briefly every evening, hold a small group meeting every five days, settle accounts every ten days, and find out the grain every quarter. The LÃ¼ Hongbin group not only achieved the three major rationalizations in the use of labor, draught cattle, and farm tools, but also grasped the three key points of mutual aid groups that are prone to collapse due to the strong seasonality of rushing to harvest wheat, harvesting and planting beans, and rushing to hoe the fire-colored land (land that dries easily), and resolved them through timely democratic consultation. The Luo Tengyun group has a system of criticism and self-criticism of "comparing benefits, calculating achievements, and checking shortcomings."

(5) Strengthen political education for members of mutual aid groups to improve their ideological awareness. The content of education should include patriotism, the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, selflessness, the benefits of organizing, and the future of agricultural development, so that farmers participating in mutual aid groups can correctly understand the relationship between "patriotic production increase" and "labor to get rich," closely integrate daily production activities with the political tasks of building a new China, so that members of mutual aid groups can see the benefits of organizing and see their bright future under the leadership of the working class, thereby eliminating conservative and backward ideas, demanding themselves with higher production increase requirements, and continuously improving their production enthusiasm. The method of education can be through winter schools, combined with people's schools, and establishing a newspaper reading system to study current affairs and politics. Where conditions permit, representatives can be recommended to visit factories, visit mechanical farms, and launch workers and farmers to communicate with each other.

(6) Cultivate labor models in mutual aid groups, enrich the backbone, and cultivate model mutual aid groups, production base villages, and production demonstration townships within the scope of a township, a district, or a county as the base points of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the process of cultivation, the production time of labor models and model mutual aid groups should be cherished, and tasks that they are not capable of should not be assigned to them. After labor models, model groups, etc. are formed, their experiences should be well promoted so that they can play a demonstrative role among the broad masses. When promoting experience, it should first be done in the local township so that they can continue to move forward under the supervision and promotion of the local masses, so as not to produce the result of "focusing on the distant and not the near."

(7) Establish various systems for leading mutual aid groups, establish the correct relationship between mutual aid groups and cooperative societies, banks, trade, and other departments, and national economic departments should vigorously support mutual aid groups so that mutual aid groups can continue to develop.

After the mutual aid groups are consolidated and developed, some mutual aid groups have rich experience and relatively strong leading backbones, and members have higher requirements, agricultural production cooperatives should be gradually developed in a planned, led, and focused manner, guiding the broad masses of farmers to the path of collectivization step by step.
