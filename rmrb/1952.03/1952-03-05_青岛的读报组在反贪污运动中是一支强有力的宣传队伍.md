    Qingdao's Reading Groups are a Powerful Propaganda Force in the Anti-Corruption Campaign

    To the Editor: After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the Qingdao City Fourth People's Representative Conference (Second Session) resolved to mobilize the city's 3,800-plus reading groups (with over 60,000 members) to make them a powerful mass propaganda force in this campaign. The Qingdao Daily organized meetings for representatives of reading group leaders from various districts, reporting on the significance and policies of carrying out the anti-corruption campaign, and at the same time, mobilized the reading groups to carry out the following tasks: 1. Seriously study relevant documents on anti-corruption and anti-waste, and understand the spirit and policies of the campaign; 2. Use various methods to conduct propaganda among the masses and mobilize all the people to participate in this struggle; 3. Take the lead in launching confession and reporting movements, ensuring "absolutely no concealment of what is known"; 4. Promptly report the progress of the campaign to the newspaper.

    In less than ten days after the meeting, the newspaper received 591 letters from reading groups. A reading group from the Taixi District wrote: "We are determined to break through all concerns and open fire on all lawbreakers who steal state property, and guarantee to lead the masses around us to report whatever they know or hear, and not let a single lawbreaker slip through the net!" Many reading group members in stores wrote to express that they would stand firm on the working class's position, not be swayed, and not be afraid of retaliation. Lu Xianting, a reading member and shop assistant at Xie Xing Hao Store No. 84 Zhiluo Road, wrote: "In the past, I didn't dare to expose the tax evasion behavior of the counter because the manager was my relative. I couldn't break through the personal ties, and I was afraid of losing my job. After studying the newspapers, I dispelled these concerns. I must follow Chairman Mao and eliminate all the filth and poison of the old society!" More than 250 reading groups in the Cangkou District have formed a mass propaganda team, which is uniformly guided by the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee. The central reading groups of the police stations in Taixi, Shibei, and Taidong districts have also formed street propaganda teams and drawn up plans for study and propaganda.

    In the upsurge of confession and reporting throughout the city, the newspaper received a large number of letters every day from reading groups reporting on propaganda activities and denunciations. Many vivid examples show the patriotic enthusiasm of the reading group members. A reading group on Xinxian Road exposed 21 cases of illegal acts of corruption and theft. Some reading groups, after discovering problems, took the initiative to assist the government in finding clues and collecting materials. In the reading groups, there emerged examples of persuading relatives and friends to confess and reporting on the corruption and theft of relatives. For example, a female reading group member on Suiyuan Road advised her unlawful husband (a businessman) to confess to the government, and the leader of the group also reported his relatives. Facts have proven that the propaganda activities of the reading groups have achieved good results.

### 青岛的读报组在反贪污运动中是一支强有力的宣传队伍

    青岛的读报组在反贪污运动中是一支强有力的宣传队伍
    编辑同志：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，青岛市四届二次各界人民代表会议决议，要把全市三千八百多个读报组（组员六万多人）发动起来，使他们成为这个运动中一支强有力的群众宣传队伍。青岛日报社分别召开了各区读报组长代表会，报告开展反贪污运动的意义和政策，同时发动读报组进行下列几件事情：一、认真学习有关反贪污浪费的文件，领会运动的精神和政策；二、用各种方式向群众进行宣传，动员全体人民参加这个斗争；三、带头开展坦白检举运动，做到“知道的决不隐瞒”；四、及时向报社反映运动的情况。
    会后不到十天，报社收到读报组来信达五百九十一件。台西区的一个读报组来信说：“我们坚决打破顾虑，要向一切盗窃国家资财的不法分子开火，并保证带领我们周围的群众做到知道就检举，听到就报告，不让一个违法分子漏网！”很多商店里的读报组员们来信表示：要站稳工人阶级立场，不被拉拢，不怕报复。芝萝路八十四号协兴号店员读报员吕仙亭来信说：“我过去对柜上的偷税行为不敢揭发，因为经理是我的亲戚，打不破情面，又怕失业，打了饭碗。经过读报学习后，我打消了这些顾虑，我一定要跟着毛主席走，把旧社会的一切污毒清除干净！”沧口区二百五十多个读报组，已组成了一个群众性的宣传大队，由中共区委会宣传部统一指导进行活动。台西、市北、台东等区各派出所的中心读报组也组成了街头宣传队，并订出了学习和宣传的计划。
    在全市坦白检举运动的高潮中，报社每日收到大批读报组报告宣传活动和检举的信件，许多生动事例，表现着读报组员爱国主义的热情。莘县路一个读报组即检举出贪污、盗窃的不法事实二十一件。有的读报组发现问题后，主动协助政府找线索，收集材料。在读报组里，涌现了规劝亲友坦白和检举亲属贪污、盗窃的事例。如绥远路一个妇女读报组员，劝告她不法丈夫（商人）向政府坦白，这个组的组长也检举了他的亲戚。事实证明，读报组的宣传活动已经收到了良好效果。
