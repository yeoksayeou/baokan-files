    Love the Motherland's Property, Carefully Protect Public Grain
    The more than 120 grain protectors in the Grain Protection Committee of the Lao Guan Miao Grain Depot in Zhonghe Township, District One, Wushan County, Eastern Sichuan, have made great achievements in their grain protection work in the past six months. They have established organizations for guarding, checking, processing, and fire prevention, each with its own responsibilities. Women guard during the day, and men patrol at night, without interruption. On the evening of June 7th last year, they maintained strict vigilance and captured a special agent who was preparing to set fire to the warehouse. Around the warehouse, they placed many sandbags and water for fire fighting. Regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, a team of two inspectors regularly went to the warehouse to check. Last summer, a million catties of public grain in the warehouse began to heat up and become infested with insects. Under the leadership of the grain depot management comrades, they opened the warehouse for ventilation every afternoon, closed it in the morning, and used blowers in shifts to blow air into the warehouse at night, finally ensuring the safety of the grain through the summer.
    Every time they turned and dried the public grain, they were very careful, and even if a grain of rice fell on the ground, they would pick it up.
    Whenever the government wanted to sift rice, the masses in the processing group would actively find sieves and borrow furniture to solve the problem of the grain depot's lack of equipment. The grain depot contracted them to process rice, and the regulation was to hand in 73 catties and six taels of polished rice for every 100 catties of paddy. But since they heard the call for "increase production and practice economy" and the news that Soviet experts were helping our country's construction and were being meticulous in everything, they further improved their understanding. Everyone used their brains to find ways to improve the local sieves and tried to dry and clean the rice as much as possible, which improved the rice yield. They voluntarily decided to hand in 74 catties of polished rice for every 100 catties of paddy. In the past two months, they have increased the wealth of the country by more than 5,000 catties of rice.
    All the members of the Grain Protection Committee are able to be so active and responsible mainly because their ideological awareness has been raised after the liberation, and they love the People's Government and the property of the state. For example, member Yang Zhengbao said: "Chairman Mao led us poor people to turn over, and I will actively respond to the call to increase production and practice economy to thank Chairman Mao." At the same time, the comrades who manage the grain depot often organize them to study, which has also helped their progress. For example, member Zhang Dama has been participating in the study for only half a year, and now she can recognize more than 300 characters and understands many principles. After studying the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, member Zhou Taoshi actively reported that Yang Zhisan, the accountant of the grain depot, had embezzled more than 5,000 catties of public grain and more than 6,000 catties of rice coupons, as well as his corrupt behavior such as opium smoking and prostitution. She said indignantly: "Yang Zhisan embezzled so much, how many years will we have to produce to make up for it! We must better protect public grain in the future and not allow it to suffer any more losses."

    热爱祖国财产小心保护公粮
    川东巫山县一区中和乡老关庙粮库护粮委员会的一百二十多个护粮员，半年来护粮工作有很大的成绩。他们成立站岗放哨、检查、加工、防火等组织，分工负责。妇女白天站岗，男子晚上放哨，从未间断过。去年六月七日晚上，他们警戒得严密，曾捕获过一个准备放火烧仓的特务。在仓库周围，他们安置了很多消防用的沙包和水。不论天晴或落雨，经常有检查组的两个人到仓库去检查。去年夏天，仓里有一百万斤公粮开始发热生虫，他们在粮库管理同志们的领导下，每天下午开仓透风，早上关仓，夜里还用鼓风机轮班向仓内车风，终于使这些公粮安全度过夏天。
    每次翻晒公粮时，他们都很小心，即使落在地上
    一粒粮食，他们都要拣起来。
    加工组的群众，每当政府要筛谷子时，他们就主动找筛子、借家具，解决粮库用具缺乏的困难。粮库包给他们加工的谷子，照规定是每百斤缴碛米七十三斤六两。但自从他们听到了“增产节约”的号召，和苏联专家帮助我们国家建设处处都精打细算的消息后，更提高了认识。大家开动脑筋，想办法改良了土筛子，尽量把稻谷晒干、拣净，这样便提高了筛米的成率。他们自动决定每百斤稻谷缴碛米七十四斤。两个月来给国家增加了五千多斤大米的财富。
    护粮委员会全体会员能够这样积极负责，主要是翻身后思想觉悟提高，热爱人民政府，热爱国家财产。如会员杨正保说：“毛主席领导我们穷人翻了身，我就要积极响应增产节约的号召，感谢毛主席。”同时，管理粮库的同志经常组织他们学习，也帮助了他们的进步。如会员张大妈参加学习不过半年，现在已能认得三百多字，还懂得很多道理。会员周陶氏经过这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的学习后，积极地检举了粮库会计杨植三盗卖公粮五千多斤和大米票六千多斤以及吸吗啡、嫖妓女等贪污腐化行为。她愤慨地说：“杨植三贪污这么多，我们要生产多少年才凑得起呀！我们以后更要好好保护公粮，不让它再受一点损失。”
