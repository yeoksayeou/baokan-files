Mei Ru'ao, Chinese jurist, former judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and member of the World Peace Council, recently spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter regarding the crimes of the American aggressor troops in using bacteriological weapons to massacre the Chinese people and violate Chinese airspace. He stated: The recent continuous intrusions by American imperialists with large numbers of military aircraft into Chinese airspace, repeatedly spreading bacterial insects in various parts of Northeast China, and massacring peaceful Chinese residents, are base and shameless acts that constitute the most blatant and barbaric violations of international law and international conventions, constituting the most serious and heinous war crimes under international law. My Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on March 8 that "any American air force personnel who intrude into Chinese airspace and use bacteriological weapons will be treated as war criminals once captured" is a completely legitimate and reasonable measure that will inevitably be supported by just people worldwide.

Mei Ru'ao said: Aggression is the most serious crime under current international law. Since the end of World War II, through the judgments of the Nuremberg and Far East International Tribunals and the support of world public opinion, engaging in aggression and undermining peace has been recognized as the "supreme crime" under international law. Since launching the Korean War, American imperialism has continuously taken open and direct acts of aggression against our country,肆意 violating our territorial sovereignty. On June 27, 1950, American imperialism openly announced the naval occupation of our territory of Taiwan. From August 27, 1950, American military aircraft began intruding into our northeastern airspace, conducting reconnaissance, strafing, and bombing. American imperialism not only shows no remorse for these naked acts of aggression, which constitute the supreme crime under international law, but has recently become even more vicious and intensified its actions, openly using large numbers of military aircraft to spread bacteria-carrying insects on a large scale in various parts of Northeast China. In just one week, from February 29 to March 5 this year, the United States dispatched 68 batches of military aircraft, totaling 448 sorties, to spread bacteria in various parts of Northeast China. There is no precedent in history for such a continuous large-scale bacterial massacre of peaceful residents.

Mei Ru'ao pointed out: Bacteriological warfare is absolutely prohibited under international law. It is illegal for either side in a conflict to use bacteriological warfare on the battlefield and constitutes a serious war crime. To use bacteria against the peaceful residents of a rear-area city in a country with which no war has been declared is an even more heinous and illegal act of violence. As everyone knows, the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 stipulated the prohibition of "poisonous weapons," which undoubtedly includes bacteriological weapons. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 explicitly declared the use of bacteriological weapons to be an illegal crime. These documents were signed by the vast majority of countries worldwide and have long formed the basic principles recognized and observed by civilized humanity under international law. The World Peace Congress, representing the wishes of peace-loving people worldwide, also firmly declared at its Second Session in 1950 the prohibition of the use of atomic bombs, bacteriological, and chemical weapons. However, in order to save itself from its inevitable defeat, the American aggressors completely disregarded these basic principles stipulated in international law and international conventions, and disregarded the common will expressed by peace-loving people worldwide. Since January 28 this year, they have conducted large-scale bacteriological warfare on the front lines and in the rear areas of Korea on many occasions. There is no doubt that this extremely serious act of violence by the American aggressor troops constitutes a "war crime of violating international conventions and rules of war" as defined by international law.

Mei Ru'ao further pointed out: The recent bacteriological massacre of our peaceful residents in the Northeast territory by American aggressors is not only a war crime of violating international conventions and rules of war; it is also the most serious "crime of aggression" because it wantonly violated our territorial sovereignty. At the same time, because it is a large-scale massacre of peaceful people, it also constitutes a "crime against humanity." Although the "crime against humanity" was created after World War II, it has been recognized by the judgments of the Nuremberg and Tokyo International Tribunals and the formulation of the "Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide" by various countries in December 1948. These types of crimes have been recognized as one of the most serious war crimes under current international law.

Mei Ru'ao pointed out: The war crimes recognized under current international law are no more than three types: 1. Crime of aggression (undermining peace); 2. Crime of violating international conventions and rules of war; 3. Crime against humanity. The recent massacre of our peaceful residents in Northeast China by the United States has committed each of these three types of war crimes, that is, all war crimes. It is both a naked, open, and direct act of aggression, the most blatant violation of international conventions and rules of war, and the most barbaric and cruel crime against humanity. The people of the world will inevitably rise up to condemn and sanction such inhuman and evil war criminals. The Chinese people are the direct victims, and we certainly have the right and responsibility to impose the most severe sanctions on them.

Mei Ru'ao concluded: As a legal scholar, I fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement that all flight personnel who intrude into our airspace and use bacteriological weapons should be treated as war criminals. At the same time, for all those who plan, prepare, launch, or participate in the execution of this war of aggression and bacteriological warfare—including American politicians, warlords, financiers, as well as American and Japanese "bacteriological experts" such as Simes, Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, Masazo Kitano and their ilk—as long as they directly or indirectly participated in this criminal conspiracy and bloody dealings at any stage, we must also treat them as war criminals once they are captured or extradited, so that these bloodthirsty devils will be subjected to the most severe and just sanctions by the people.

### 梅汝璈向新华社记者发表谈话  抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行

    梅汝璈向新华社记者发表谈话
    抗议美国侵略者使用细菌武器的罪行
    我国法学家、前远东国际军事法庭法官、世界和平理事会理事梅汝璈，顷就美国侵略军使用细菌武器屠杀我国人民、侵犯我国领空的罪行，向新华社记者发表谈话称：美帝国主义者最近连续以大批军用飞机侵入我国领空、在我国东北各地多次撒布细菌昆虫、屠杀我国和平居民，这种卑鄙无耻的行为是对国际公法和国际公约最粗暴最野蛮的破坏，构成国际法上最严重最恶劣的战争犯罪。我周外长三月八日声明“凡属侵入中国领空、使用细菌武器的美国空军人员，一经俘获，即行作为战争罪犯处理。”那是完全合法合理的措施，必然获得全世界正直人民的拥护。
    梅汝璈说：侵略是现在国际法上最严重的罪行。自第二次世界大战终结、经过纽伦堡及远东国际法庭的判决和全世界舆论的支持，从事侵略和破坏和平已被确认为国际法上的“最大罪行”。美帝国主义自发动朝鲜战争以来，曾继续不断地对我国采取了公开的直接的侵略行为，肆无忌讳地破坏了我们的领土主权。在一九五○年六月二十七日，美帝国主义便公然宣布以海军占领我国领土台湾。从一九五○年八月二十七日起，美国军用机又开始侵入我国东北领空，进行侦察、扫射和轰炸。美帝国主义对这些构成国际法上最大罪行的赤裸裸的侵略行为，不但毫无悔祸之意，而且最近更是穷凶极恶、变本加厉，竟公然以大批军用飞机在我东北各地大量撒布传播细菌的昆虫。仅自今年二月二十九日到三月五日的这一个星期内，美国便出动了军用飞机六十八批、四百四十八架次，在我国东北各地撒布细菌。对和平居民实行这样连续的大规模的细菌屠杀，在历史上是没有先例的。
    梅汝璈指出：细菌作战是国际法上所绝对禁止的。交战双方在战场上使用细菌作战都是违法的，构成严重的战争犯罪。至于对一个未经宣战国家后方城市的和平居民使用细菌，那更是罪大恶极的违法暴行。大家都知道：一八九九年和一九○七年的海牙公约规定禁用“有毒武器”，无疑地包括着细菌武器在内。一九二五年的日内瓦议定书更明文宣布了使用细菌武器是违法的罪行。这些文件是全世界极大多数国家所签订的，在国际法上早已形成了文明人类所公认和共守的基本原则。代表全世界和平人民意愿的世界和平大会在一九五○年第二届会议上也坚决宣布了禁止使用原子弹、细菌和化学武器。但是，美国侵略者为了妄图挽救它不能挽救的失败，却完全不顾这些国际法和国际公约上所规定的基本原则，不顾全世界和平人民所表示的共同意愿，自今年一月二十八日起，便在朝鲜前线和后方大规模地进行了多次的细菌战。毫无疑义，美国侵略军的这种极端严重的暴行，构成了国际法上所称的“破坏国际公约和作战法规的战争犯罪”。
    梅汝璈进一步指出：美国侵略者最近在我东北领土对我和平居民所进行的细菌屠杀，不仅是犯了破坏国际公约和作战法规的战争犯罪；同时，还犯了最严重的“侵略罪”，因为它横暴地侵犯了我国领土主权。同时，由于它是对和平人民大规模的屠杀，又构成“违反人道罪”。“违反人道罪”虽是二次世界大战后所创立的，但经过纽伦堡和东京国际法庭的判决承认和一九四八年十二月各国“禁止灭杀人种公约”的制订，这类罪行在今日的国际法上已被确认为战争犯罪中最严重的一种。
    梅汝璈指出：现在国际法上所承认的战争犯罪不外三种：一、侵略（破坏和平）罪；二、破坏国际公约和作战法规罪；三、违反人道罪。美国最近对我东北和平居民的屠杀犯了这三种战罪中的每一种，亦即战争犯罪的全部。它既是赤裸裸的公开直接侵略的罪行，又是最粗暴地破坏国际公约和作战法规的罪行，也是最野蛮最残酷的违反人道的罪行。对这样灭绝人性、无恶不作的战争罪犯，全世界人民必然都会起来加以声讨和制裁。中国人民是直接受害者，我们当然更有权有责对他们予以最严厉的制裁。
    梅汝璈最后说：作为一个法律学者，我完全拥护周外长的声明，把那些侵入我国领空、使用细菌武器的飞行人员，一律当做战犯看待。同时，对于那些从事策划、准备、发动或参加执行这种侵略战和细菌战的一切人们——包括美国的政客们、军阀们、财阀们以及美日“细菌专家”们如赛姆斯、石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏之流，只要直接或间接在任何阶段中参加过这种罪恶阴谋和血腥勾当，他日一经俘获或引渡，我们也必须把他们作为战犯处理，使这班杀人不见血的魔鬼，都受到人民最严厉的正义的制裁。（新华社）
