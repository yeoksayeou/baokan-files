    Beijing Dongsi People's Market Phonograph Industry
    Accepts Reader Criticism and Guarantees to No Longer Broadcast Poisonous Records
    Editor: The criticism from Comrade Song Qi in the People's Daily "Readers' Letters" column on March 12 regarding the Dongsi People's Market phonograph industry broadcasting yellow records is completely correct. All the vendors in the phonograph industry convened a meeting specifically to conduct a review and made a guarantee at the meeting: From now on, they will no longer broadcast poisonous records in the market. Our Dongsi People's Market Vendors' Union Preparatory Committee Business Guidance Group was wrong for failing to discover and stop this bad phenomenon in a timely manner and made an on-the-spot self-criticism. We hope everyone will continue to offer criticisms of the Dongsi People's Market at any time. We will sincerely accept and strive to correct them.

    北京东四人民市场唱机业
    接受读者批评，保证不再放送有毒素的唱片
    编辑同志：三月十二日人民日报读者来信栏内登载了宋奇同志对于东四人民市场唱机业放送黄色唱片的批评，这是完全正确的。唱机业全体摊商，为此召开了一个会议，专门进行了检讨，并在会上提出保证：今后不再在市场里放送有毒素的唱片。我们东四人民市场摊贩联合会筹备委员会业务指导组对此不良现象未能及时发现和加以制止，是不对的，当场作了检讨。希望大家对东四人民市场随时提出批评，我们一定诚恳接受并努力改正。
    北京东四人民市场摊贩联合会筹备委员会
