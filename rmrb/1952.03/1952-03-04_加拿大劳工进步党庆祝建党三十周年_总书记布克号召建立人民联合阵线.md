Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, March 3rd: The Labor-Progressive Party of Canada held a rally in Toronto last week to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of its founding. Twenty-five hundred people attended the rally, where Labor-Progressive Party General Secretary Buck delivered a speech outlining the party's new program. The goal of this program is to establish a People's United Front, create a People's Government, restore independence, uphold peace, and join hands with all countries in the world that respect Canadian national independence to struggle together.

Buck called on the people to unite and save their country from the dangers of war and economic enslavement incited by the United States. Buck said: The struggle to achieve people's governance is inseparable from the struggle for peace, because those elements of the Canadian bourgeoisie who are selling Canada to the United States are also prepared to drag Canada into war on behalf of American imperialism. Buck concluded by pointing out that through the struggle for independence, a People's Parliament will be established and a people's democracy will be built. Through the alliance of all democratic forces and the unity of all Canadian patriots, Canada will regain its independence.

Executive Committee member Buchai then spoke, providing a historical review of the path the party has taken over the past thirty years.

Telegrams of congratulations were read at the meeting from the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Great Britain, Italy, Israel, and many other countries.

    加拿大劳工进步党庆祝建党三十周年
    总书记布克号召建立人民联合阵线
    【新华社三日讯】多伦多消息：加拿大劳工进步党上周在多伦多举行集会，庆祝加拿大劳工进步党建党三十周年，出席集会的有二千五百人，劳工进步党总书记布克在会上发表演说，阐明加拿大劳工进步党的新纲领。这个纲领的目标是成立人民联合阵线，建立人民政府、恢复独立、拥护和平、与世界上一切尊重加拿大民族独立的国家携手而共同斗争。
    布克号召人民团结起来，拯救他们的国家免遭美国煽动的战争的危险与经济的奴役。布克说：争取人民执政的斗争是与争取和平的斗争分不开的，因为加拿大资产阶级中那些把加拿大出卖给美国的分子也准备代表美帝国主义把加拿大拖入战争。布克最后指出：通过争取独立的斗争，人民议会必将成立，人民民主制度必将建立。通过一切民主力量的联盟和一切加拿大爱国人士的团结，加拿大必将重获独立。
    接着由党执行委员会委员布海发言，他就党在三十年中所经历的道路作一历史的回顾。
    会上宣读了苏联、中华人民共和国、英国、意大利、以色列及其他许多国家的共产党寄来的贺电。
