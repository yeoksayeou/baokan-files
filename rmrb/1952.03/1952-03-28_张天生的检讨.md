    Zhang Tiansheng's Self-Criticism

    Comrade Editor: Your letter has been received. The criticism from Comrade Wang Yifeng and other comrades from the Pingyu County Cooperative General Agency regarding my irresponsible writing is entirely correct. When I wrote the稿 (gao3, manuscript/article), I lacked a serious and conscientious spirit, resulting in a "misattribution" [literally "Zhang Guan wears Li Dai's hat," an idiom for misattribution or mistaken identity], which consequently affected the development of the cooperative cause in Pingyu County. This is entirely my fault. I will certainly learn from this incident in the future, overcome my careless work style, and establish a serious, responsible, and fact-based work style to avoid similar errors from happening again.
        Zhang Tiansheng

    张天生的检讨
    编辑同志：来信收到。平舆县合作总社王一峰等同志对我写稿不负责任提出批评，这是完全正确的。我写稿时缺乏严肃认真的精神，弄成“张冠李戴”，因而影响了平舆县合作事业的发展。这完全是我的错误。我今后一定接受这一事件的教训，克服马虎作风，并树立起认真负责和实事求是的作风，避免再发生类似的错误。    张天生
