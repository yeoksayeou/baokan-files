    Beijing Ninth District Cooperative
    Many Cadres Neglect Current Affairs Study
    The Vast Majority Basically Don't Read Newspapers;
    Some Read Newspapers to "Find Amusement"
    Comrade Editor: Many staff members of the Beijing Ninth District Cooperative have a serious tendency to "emphasize business and neglect politics." The Ninth District United Cooperative was established in June of last year, and a formal study system has not yet been established to this day. The situation of staff studying newspapers is very poor. In our entire cooperative, with more than 170 people, only 32 newspapers are subscribed to; only 19 people regularly read and pay attention to the main content, and the vast majority do not read the newspaper or occasionally "browse" the headlines. It is particularly worth mentioning that among the comrades who read the newspaper more seriously, only three or four regularly read the People's Daily editorials; some comrades read the newspaper to "find some amusement and relieve boredom." This situation is very serious.
    Many people do not pay attention to reading newspapers, therefore, they lack the necessary understanding of major domestic and international political issues. To this day, many cadres' understanding of the "Three-Anti" movement is still very vague, and some cadres even believe that carrying out the "Three-Anti" is to confiscate the property of cadres. A portion of comrades here are still not very clear about the crimes of American imperialism in spreading bacteria in Korea and our Northeast and Qingdao. The day after the Central Commission for the Inspection of Economy and Finance published the "Certain Provisions Regarding the Handling of Corruption, Waste, and Overcoming Bureaucratic Errors," the "tiger beaters" did not know about it.
    Why don't these people pay attention to reading newspapers? As far as I know: most of those who do not pay attention to reading newspapers are business personnel and workers. They work from 7:30 in the morning until 6:00 in the afternoon, and they still have to settle accounts in the evening, so there is very little time to read the newspaper; some people are indeed limited by their cultural level and cannot understand the content of the newspaper, which is a real objective difficulty. Of course, they also have incorrect ideas subjectively, such as some people thinking that "newspapers have nothing to do with us, it's the same whether we read them or not." Some business personnel themselves said: "I have been participating in the cooperative for more than two years, and I have never read a newspaper." However, I think the key to the problem lies in the fact that leading cadres neglect political current affairs education for cadres. I hope to expose this tendency to neglect politics in the newspaper to attract the attention of the leading organs.

### 北京市第九区合作社  许多干部忽视时事学习  绝大多数人基本上不看报，有人看报是为了“找趣味”

    北京市第九区合作社
    许多干部忽视时事学习
    绝大多数人基本上不看报，
    有人看报是为了“找趣味”
    编辑同志：北京市第九区合作社许多工作人员，存在着严重的“重业务，轻政治”的倾向。第九区联社在去年六月成立，到现在还没有建立起正规的学习制度。工作人员学习报纸的情况是很不好的。我们全社有一百七十多人，订了三十二份报纸；能够经常看报并注意阅读主要内容的仅有十九人，绝大多数的人是不读报或偶尔把报纸上的大标题“阅览”一下。特别值得提出的是，在比较认真读报的同志们中间，经常看人民日报社论的仅有三、四人；有些同志看报是为了“找些趣味，解解闷”。这种情况是十分严重的。
    许多人不注意阅读报纸，因此，他们对于国内外重大的政治问题缺乏应有的认识。至今仍有不少干部对“三反”运动的认识十分模糊，甚至有的干部认为搞“三反”是要把干部的家产充公。我们这里竟有一部分同志到现在还不大清楚美帝国主义在朝鲜及我国东北和青岛等地撒布细菌的罪行。报纸发表了中央节约检查委员会“关于处理贪污、浪费及克服官僚主义错误的若干规定”的第二天，“打虎”队员们还不知道有这一回事。
    为什么这些人不注意阅读报纸呢？据我所知：不注意读报的多数是业务员和工人。他们从早上七时半开始工作一直到下午六时，晚上还要结账，看报的时间是很少的；有些人确实受文化水平的限制，不能理解报纸的内容，这是实际存在的客观困难。当然，他们在主观上也存在着不正确的思想，如有的人认为“报纸对我们没有多大关系，看不看一样工作。”有的业务员自己说：“我参加合作社两年多，就没看过报。”但是，我认为问题的关键在于领导干部忽视干部政治时事教育。我希望在报上揭发这种忽视政治的倾向，以引起领导机关的注意。
