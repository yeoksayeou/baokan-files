Since the launch of the "Three-Anti" movement, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, many trade union organizations have achieved great results in their own "Three-Anti" movements and have played an active role in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in public and private industrial and commercial enterprises. However, many trade union organizations have not yet launched their own "Three-Anti" movements, or have not carried them out thoroughly. The reason for this is that, in cities where the "Five-Anti" movement has been launched, trade unions have generally been engaged in the urgent "Five-Anti" movement under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, and have not had time to carry out their own "Three-Anti" movement, or it has not been possible to carry out the trade union's own "Three-Anti" movement thoroughly for a time. In cities where the "Five-Anti" movement has not yet been launched, in addition to some who are actively preparing for the "Five-Anti" work under the leadership of the Party, there are also some trade union organizations that underestimate the problems within the trade union itself, thinking that the problems of corruption and waste in the trade union are not significant, that there is nothing to oppose, or that some leading cadres are not clean themselves, or that bureaucratism is very serious.

It must be recognized that the problems in the trade union system are serious. Not only are the problems serious in trade unions in private enterprises, but also in trade unions in state-owned and public enterprises, and in the leadership organs of trade unions at all levels. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the national committees of various industrial trade unions, as well as some provincial and municipal federations of trade unions, have already cleared out a number of corrupt elements, some of whom have embezzled more than 800 million yuan. In small cities, towns, and some mining trade unions, the scope of embezzlement is even wider, and the amount of embezzlement is also very large. The chairman of the Shaoyang City Trade Union in Hunan Province is a big "tiger"; the vice-chairman of the Changxing County Trade Union in Zhejiang is also a big "tiger," and he even killed the accountant to silence him. The nature of some embezzlement is very serious, such as embezzling membership dues, labor insurance funds, mutual aid funds, donations for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, cultural and educational expenses, unemployment relief funds, family relief funds, etc., and even extorting workers' wages. For example, Huang Jingting, chairman of the Pukou Civil Ship Trade Union, extorted 120,000 yuan from a worker (the worker's monthly wage was only 130,000 yuan), causing his family to go hungry for a month; Liu Jianzhong, a representative of a civil ship trade union, extorted more than 10 million yuan from workers.

Among the trade union cadres in private factories and shops, many have been "sent in" or "pulled over" by capitalists. For example, Hou Boling, the cultural and educational committee member of the Fuxing Cigarette Factory in Nanjing, was secretly appointed as the deputy director of the factory by the capitalist; the cultural and educational committee member of the Capital Match Factory in Nanjing was recognized as a godson by the capitalist... These people were all pulled over by the capitalists. Lin Wenchao, chairman of the Wuxi Southwest Steamship Company Trade Union, Zhu Kaiyuan, a member of the Xi'an Dahua Textile Factory Trade Union and the labor representative of the Labor-Capital Consultation Committee, Xu Dihai, vice-chairman of the Shanghai New China Scissors Factory Trade Union... were all sent in by capitalists in a planned way. Ding Shaoxian, vice-chairman of the Nanjing British-owned Hutchison Factory Trade Union, even became a running dog of imperialist elements. As for being bewitched by the flattery of capitalists, having a blurred class consciousness, and an unstable class stance, this is even more common.

There are also some production units run by trade union organs themselves that have degenerated into "factories" and "shops" that exploit workers. For example, the Nanjing Shangxinhe Transport Trade Union, in order to run a so-called "production cooperative," extracted 20 percent of the workers' wages and opened a sawmill, rice mill, and tofu shop, using merchants, secret agents, and traitors as heads, colluding with private merchants, engaging in speculation and profiteering, and stealing state property, which was completely a set of illegal capitalists. The Datong Transport Trade Union, which operates its own transportation business, assigns "captains" and "deputy captains" to workers, which is no different from headmen.

Why are the problems in the trade union system so serious? Because the trade union is one of the main targets of the bourgeoisie's attack. In order to maintain its oppression and exploitation of the working class, the bourgeoisie does not hesitate to use all possible despicable means to corrupt, win over, buy off, and influence some trade union cadres. The bourgeoisie's rampant attack, coupled with the impurity within the trade union and the bureaucratism of leaders at all levels, has made the problems of the trade union particularly serious. The bourgeoisie's attack must be resolutely repelled, and the problems of the trade union leadership organs must be thoroughly resolved. This is the most urgent and most important issue before us. By solving this problem, we can victoriously lead the broad masses of workers, launch a movement to increase production and practice economy, and embark on the road of large-scale construction.

All trade union cadres must examine their own positions, thoughts, and actions, and bravely abandon their own "burdens." Doing so is precisely a counterattack against the bourgeoisie. All members and non-member workers must actively expose the corruption, bribery, loss of position, and bureaucratism of trade union cadres, and help them unload their "burdens." Doing so is also a counterattack against the bourgeoisie's rampant attack. Those who have been sent in or pulled over by the bourgeoisie, or who have seriously lost their position, and those who are seriously corrupt, must be removed from leadership positions at all levels. If they do not thoroughly confess, repent, and resolutely stand on the side of the working class, their membership should also be expelled. At the same time, activists who have a firm stand, are supported by the masses, and have certain working abilities should be promoted to leadership positions to replace them.

In the "Three-Anti" movement in the trade union system, all kinds of funds sent from above and collected from below—regular expenses, membership dues, donations for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, mutual aid funds, unemployment relief funds, cultural and educational expenses, labor insurance funds, production of organs, etc.—must be thoroughly investigated. Where the amount of funds handled is very large and the system is very chaotic, there must be many problems. It is necessary to clarify the problems under the leadership of the Party and with the full mobilization of the masses of organs and members. The results of the investigation should be announced to the masses and reported to the higher authorities.

After the problems in the trade union itself have been clarified, in addition to helping the lower-level trade unions to complete the "Three-Anti," it is necessary to use the main force to go deep into public and private industrial and commercial enterprises, mobilize the masses of workers, and launch the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. Units that have not thoroughly carried out their own "Three-Anti" before going down to carry out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" must make up for this lesson of their own "Three-Anti" at an appropriate time.

In the "Three-Anti" movement in state-owned and public enterprises, the problems of the trade union and the problems of administrative management can be checked and resolved together under the unified leadership of the Party. And the problems of leading cadres (administrative and trade union) should be solved first, and then the problems of general personnel. If such steps are not taken, the enterprise's leadership group will not dare to mobilize the masses, and it will be very easy for the true corrupt elements to turn the spearhead of the movement towards the workers. In private enterprises, the problems of the trade union should generally be solved first, and then the "Five-Anti" should be launched. If the trade union has problems that are not resolved, it cannot become the headquarters for the "Five-Anti." Of course, it is also possible to first carry out the "Five-Anti" and then the "Three-Anti" with external support. In the "Five-Anti" movement or after the "Five-Anti" movement, it is also necessary to carry out the rectification of the trade union in conjunction with the specific situation. In the "Five-Anti" movement, it is not only necessary to fully mobilize the masses of workers, but also to win over the majority of staff members, and to pay special attention to winning over and uniting accountants, runners, and senior staff members. Only in this way can the capitalist be isolated and placed under the supervision of the masses.

Regardless of whether it is in the "Three-Anti" movement in state-owned and public enterprises or the "Five-Anti" movement in private enterprises, it is necessary to use realistic materials to educate the masses of workers and thoroughly distinguish the boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie, recognize the antagonistic nature of the bourgeoisie towards the working class, recognize the leadership responsibility and bright future of the working class, and raise the class consciousness of the masses. And in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, thoroughly complete the democratic reform of public and private enterprises, rectify trade union organizations, establish democratic systems for enterprises and trade unions, and prepare favorable conditions for increasing production and practicing economy.

In the "Three-Anti" movement, trade union organizations in state-owned enterprises must not only mobilize workers to actively participate in the "Three-Anti" movement, but also mobilize the masses to adhere to production, adhere to labor discipline, and pay attention to the responsibility system and security system, so as to ensure the completion of the state's production tasks.

### 中华全国总工会  关于进一步开展工会系统的“三反”运动的指示

    中华全国总工会
    关于进一步开展工会系统的“三反”运动的指示
    “三反”运动以来，在各级党委的领导下，许多工会组织本身的“三反”运动已经取得很大成绩，并且在公私工商企业的“三反”、“五反”运动中发挥了工会组织的积极作用。可是也有许多工会组织本身的“三反”运动至今还没有开展起来或开展得还不彻底。其原因，在已经开展了“五反”运动的城市，一般是因为工会在当地党委的统一领导下去进行迫不容缓的“五反”运动，而顾不上去搞工会本身的“三反”运动，或一时不可能把工会本身的“三反”运动搞彻底；在尚未开展“五反”运动的城市，除掉某些由于正在党的领导下，积极准备“五反”工作者外，还有一些工会组织是由于对工会本身的问题估计不足，以为工会中的贪污、浪费问题不大，没有什么反头，或是某些领导干部自己的手面不干净，或是官僚主义十分严重。
    必须认识：工会系统的问题是严重的。不但私营企业的工会问题严重，国营、公营企业的工会和工会的各级领导机关的问题也是严重的。全国总工会和各产业工会全国委员会以及某些省、市总工会，都已经清出了一批贪污分子，其中有贪污达八亿元以上者。小市、镇和某些矿山工会，贪污的面更大，贪污的数量也很大。湖南省邵阳市工会主席就是一只大“老虎”；浙江长兴县工会副主席也是一只大“老虎”，而且为了灭口，他还杀死了会计。贪污的性质有些是很严重的，如贪污会费、劳动保险费、互助金、抗美援朝捐献款、文教费、失业救济金、家属救济费等，甚至有勒索工人工资者。如浦口民船工会主席黄景亭勒索某工人十二万元（该工人一月工资仅十三万元），使其全家饿了一个月；一个民船工会代表刘建忠，竟勒索工人一千余万元。
    在私营工厂、商店的工会干部中，被资本家“派进来”或“拉过去”的也是很多的。例如南京福星烟厂工会文教委员侯伯令，被资本家秘密委任为副厂长；南京首都火柴厂工会文教委员，被资本家认作干儿子，……这些人都是资本家拉过去的。无锡西南轮船公司工会主席林文超，西安大华纱厂工会委员、劳资协商委员会的劳方代表朱开元，上海新中华刀剪工厂工会副主席徐地洋，……都是资本家有计划派进来的。南京英商和记工厂工会副主席丁绍先，竟成为帝国主义分子的走狗。至于为资本家的恭维奉承所迷惑，阶级意识模糊，阶级立场不稳，则更是普遍现象。
    还有一些工会机关自己搞的生产单位，已蜕变为剥削工人的“厂”、“店”。如南京上新河搬运工会为举办所谓“生产合作社”，抽取工人工资百分之二十，开了锯木厂、碾米厂、豆腐店，利用商人、特务、叛徒为负责人，勾结私商，投机倒把，盗窃国家财产，完全是违法资本家的一套。大同搬运工会，自己经营运输业，给工人派“大队长”、“大队副”，和把头没有两样。
    为什么工会系统中的问题这样严重呢？因为工会是资产阶级进攻的主要目标之一。资产阶级为了维持它对工人阶级的压榨剥削，不惜采取一切可能的卑鄙手段，来腐蚀、拉拢、收买和影响一部分工会干部。资产阶级的猖狂进攻，加上工会内部的不纯和各级领导的官僚主义，就使工会的问题异常严重。资产阶级的进攻必须坚决打退，工会领导机关的问题必须彻底解决。这就是摆在我们面前的最紧迫、最重要的问题。解决了这一问题，我们才能胜利地领导广大的工人群众，开展增产节约运动，走向大规模建设的道路。
    所有的工会干部，都必须检查自己的立场、思想和行为，勇敢地丢掉自己的“包袱”。这样做，就正好是对于资产阶级的反击。所有的会员同志们和非会员职工同志们，都要积极地揭发工会干部的贪污、受贿、丧失立场、官僚主义等行为，帮助他们卸下“包袱”。这样做，也是对于资产阶级猖狂进攻的反击。那些被资产阶级派进来、拉过去或严重地丧失立场的分子、严重的贪污分子，都必须从各级领导岗位上撤下来。如他们不彻底坦白，痛改前非，坚决站在工人阶级方面来，还应当开除他们的会籍。同时应提拔那些立场坚定、群众拥护、有一定工作能力的积极分子到领导岗位上来代替他们。
    在工会系统的“三反”运动中，必须彻底清查经上边发来的和从下边收来的各种款项——经常费、会费、抗美援朝捐献款、互助金、失业救济金、文教费、劳动保险费、机关生产等。凡经手款项很大，制度很乱的，问题一定很多，必须在党的领导下，并充分发动机关群众和会员群众，才能把问题弄清。清查的结果，要向群众公布和向上级报告。
    工会本身的问题弄清之后，除了帮助下边工会完成“三反”之外，必须以主要的力量，深入公私工商企业，发动职工群众，开展“三反”、“五反”运动。本身的“三反”没有搞彻底就下去开展“三反”、“五反”的单位，必须在适当的时机补足本身“三反”的这一课。
    在国营、公营企业的“三反”运动中，工会的问题和行政管理方面的问题，可以在党的统一领导下，一并检查解决。并且应该首先解决领导干部（行政的和工会的）的问题，然后再解决一般人员的问题。不采取这样的步骤，企业的领导集团就不敢发动群众，就很容易被那些真正贪污分子把运动的锋芒转向工人群众。在私营企业当中，一般应该先解决工会的问题，然后开展“五反”。工会如果有问题而得不到解决，它就不能成为“五反”的指挥部。当然，在外力支援之下，先“五反”再“三反”也是可以的。在“五反”运动中或“五反”运动后，还需要结合具体情况，进行工会的整顿工作。在“五反”运动中，不但要充分地发动工人群众，而且要争取大多数职员，特别要注意争取、团结会计、跑外与高级职员。只有这样，才能把资本家孤立起来，才能把它放在群众监督之下。
    不管在国营、公营企业的“三反”运动中或私营企业的“五反”运动中，都必须以现实的材料，教育职工群众，彻底分清工人阶级与资产阶级的界限，认识资产阶级对工人阶级的敌对性质，认识工人阶级的领导责任和光明远大的前途，提高群众的阶级觉悟，并在“三反”、“五反”运动中，彻底完成公私企业的民主改革，整顿工会组织，建立企业的和工会的民主制度，为增产节约准备有利条件。
    在“三反”运动中，国营企业中的工会组织，不但要发动工人积极参加“三反”运动，同时必须发动群众坚持生产，坚持劳动纪律，注意责任制和保安制度，以保证国家生产任务的完成。
