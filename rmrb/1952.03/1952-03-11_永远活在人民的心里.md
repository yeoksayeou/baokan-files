In recent days, many people have come to the home of a farmer in Tongzi Village, Songshan Township, Xinhua County, Hunan Province, to express their condolences to the owner of the house—this is the home of the immortal internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao. His family includes his father, mother, three younger sisters, and a younger brother.

Luo Shengjiao was a brave soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and an outstanding member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, only twenty-one years old. On January 2nd of this year, in order to save a Korean boy named Cui Ying, he braved the sub-zero temperature of twenty degrees Celsius and plunged into the icy river three times, saving the boy at the cost of his own life.

Like on the front lines in Korea, Comrade Luo Shengjiao's heroic deeds have been widely spread and studied in the rear of the motherland. Especially in Comrade Luo Shengjiao's hometown—Xinhua County, Hunan Province—people feel infinitely honored and proud of this. The county's blackboards and reading groups are widely promoting this shining example. The Xinhua County People's Government has also provided generous compensation to the martyr's family, and the local people are enthusiastically helping the martyr's family solve difficulties in production and life.

Luo Shengjiao's family has continuously received many letters of condolence from various places. Zhang Yanwen, a convalescing member of the Volunteer Army recuperating in a hospital in Wuhu, wrote to the parents of the martyr Luo: "In order to learn from the great spirit of my comrade-in-arms, after my injuries heal, I will return to the front line to strike at American imperialism!" Li Hui of the Hubei Provincial People's Government Guesthouse wrote in a letter of condolence: "Although martyr Luo sacrificed himself, his great internationalism and patriotism will forever live in the hearts of the people! You have lost a son or brother, but all revolutionary youths who, like Comrade Luo Shengjiao, fight for the motherland and the people are your sons or brothers, and they will cherish you as they would their own parents and siblings."

On February 22nd, Zhang Lie, the head of the Central South Branch of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, and Huang Guihan, the head of the Central South Branch of the Korean People's Visiting China Delegation, and representative Xu Jinyu, met with Comrade Luo Shengjiao's parents, younger siblings, in Xinhua County. The representatives cordially expressed their condolences to them. They also told the representatives many stories about the martyr and took out the martyr's letters sent back from the front line. From his letters, people can more deeply understand the unparalleled deep feelings this great internationalist fighter had for the Korean people. He wrote in his letter: "The beasts' planes destroyed the houses of the Korean people, so they dug earth caves in the mountains and continued to work, continuing to fight unyieldingly for the happiness of the Korean people's descendants. These facts are enough to prove that the Korean people are steadfast and unyielding and cannot be defeated." Luo Shengjiao's letter was full of boundless hatred for the American aggressors. One passage describes his feelings when crossing the Yalu River: "Looking at Sinuiju on the opposite side, I thought, 'This is one of Korea's major cities, why is there no electricity?' But I immediately understood everything: when I stepped onto Korean soil for the first time after getting off the bridge, I smelled the scent of smoke and gunpowder. The beautiful city has been bombed by the beasts' planes! All that remains is scorched earth and rubble. My heart ached, I shed tears, and I was filled with boundless anger. I vowed: I will not cross this bridge again until I have eliminated the American imperialist dog robbers!" The letter wrote about the great victory of the Chinese and Korean troops: "Our situation is getting better and better as we fight, and the enemy is becoming less and less able to hold on. Every one of our comrades has the confidence to eliminate the invaders, avenge the Korean people, win glory for the motherland, and win glory for Chairman Mao!"

Yes, this immortal internationalist fighter has won infinite glory for Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland. Huang Guihan, the head of the sub-delegation, said gratefully to the martyr's parents: "Your son's excellent qualities and outstanding behavior have set a shining example for us, the Korean people. He will forever live in the hearts of our Korean people and all people who love freedom and peace!"

When Zhang Lie, Huang Guihan, and others left Xinhua, Luo Diekai, the martyr's father, gave a letter to the Korean boy Cui Ying to Huang Guihan, asking him to bring it to Cui Ying. The letter said: "Shengjiao has sacrificed himself, but you are still alive. I will treat you as if you were Shengjiao. I hope you will write to me often. I am truly grateful to the Korean mother who prepared her own burial place to bury Shengjiao and to those Korean people who treated Shengjiao as family. I hope you will convey my gratitude to them." Huang Guihan repeatedly told him: "Please rest assured, I will bring the letter! Cui Ying will definitely write to you and send you his photos. Because he is not only the son of the Korean people but also your son!"

    永远活在人民的心里
    新华社记者　方堤
    这些天来，在湖南省新化县松山乡桐子村的一个农民家里，经常有许多人来慰问这家的主人——这就是不朽的国际主义战士罗盛教的家，他家里有父亲、母亲、三个妹妹和一个弟弟。
    罗盛教是中国人民志愿军中的一个勇敢的战士，是年仅二十一岁的中国新民主主义青年团优秀团员。今年一月二日，为了抢救一个叫崔?的朝鲜少年，他冒着零下二十度的严寒，三次钻进冰河里，拯救了这个少年而牺牲了自己。
    和在朝鲜前线一样，罗盛教同志的英雄事迹在祖国的后方也被广泛地传诵着、学习着。特别是在罗盛教同志的故乡——湖南省新化县，人们都以此而感到无限光荣和骄傲。该县的黑板报和读报组，普遍宣传着这一光辉榜样。新化县人民政府并对烈士的家属进行了优厚的抚恤，当地群众也热情地帮助烈士家属解决生产和生活中的困难。
    罗盛教的家里，不断接到了许多来自各地的慰问信。正在芜湖某医院里休养的志愿军休养员张彦文写信给罗烈士的父母亲说：“为了学习我的战友的伟大精神，等伤好后，我要重返前线，打击美帝国主义！”湖北省人民政府招待所李蕙的慰问信说：“罗烈士虽然牺牲了，但他的伟大的国际主义和爱国主义精神是永远活在人民的心里的！您们失去了一个儿子或兄弟，但所有像罗盛教同志一样的为祖国为人民而斗争的革命青年，都是您们的儿子或兄弟，他们会像爱护自己的父母和兄弟姐妹一样来爱护您们。”
    二月二十二日，中国人民志愿军归国代表团中南分团团长张烈、朝鲜人民访华代表团中南分团团长黄龟汉和代表许金玉，到新化县和罗盛教同志的父母弟妹们见了面。代表们亲切地慰问了他们。他们也告诉了代表们许多关于烈士的事迹和拿出了烈士自前线寄回的家书，从他的信里，人们可以更深切地理解这位伟大的国际主义战士对朝鲜人民怀着的无比深厚的感情。他在信中写道：“野兽们的飞机把朝鲜人民的房屋炸毁了，他们便在山地里挖一个土洞，继续劳动，继续为朝鲜人民的子子孙孙的幸福，进行不屈的战斗。这些事实足以证明：朝鲜人民是坚毅不屈的，是不可战胜的。”罗盛教的信中充满着对美国侵略者无比的仇恨，其中有一段描述跨过鸭绿江时的心情说：“我望着对面的新义州，心里想着：‘这是朝鲜的大城市之一，为什么没有电灯呢？’但立即我就明白了一切：当我下桥第一脚踏上朝鲜的土地时，我就嗅到了烟烬和火药的气味。美丽的城市已经被野兽的飞机炸光了！剩下的只是一片焦土和碎瓦。我心酸了，流泪了，也无比地愤怒了。我发誓：非消灭美帝狗强盗不可，否则，我再不过这座大桥！”信中写到中朝部队的伟大胜利说：“我们的情况越打越好，敌人越打越不撑劲了。我们每个同志都有信心消灭侵略者，为朝鲜人民复仇，为祖国争光，为毛主席争光！”
    是的，这个永垂不朽的国际主义战士，已经为毛主席和祖国人民争得了无限光荣。黄龟汉分团长对烈士的父母亲感激地说：“你们儿子的优秀品质与卓越行为，已经给我们朝鲜人民作出了光辉的榜样。他将永远地活在我们朝鲜人民和全世界爱好自由、和平的人们的心里！”
    当张烈、黄龟汉等离开新化的时候，烈士的父亲罗迭开老人把给朝鲜少年崔?的信交给黄龟汉分团长，请他带给崔?。信中说：“盛教已经牺牲了，但是你还活着，我要把你当作盛教一样来看待。希望你常给我写信。我真感谢那位把准备作自己的葬地拿来安葬盛教的朝鲜母亲和那些对待盛教如亲人一样的朝鲜人民，希望你把我的感激告诉他们。”黄龟汉再三地告诉他说：“请放心吧，我会把信带到的！崔?一定会给你们来信，会把他的相片寄给你们。因为他不仅是朝鲜人民的儿子，也是你们的儿子！”
