Economic Briefs

    ▲ With the gradual melting of ice and snow in various parts of Xinjiang Province, farmers in the Turpan Basin in southern Xinjiang have begun spring plowing. Xinjiang Province universally implemented rent reduction in rural areas last winter and this spring. The feudal forces in the countryside have been weakened, and the enthusiasm of farmers for increasing production has been heightened. Moreover, various localities have obtained some much-needed means of production during the rent reduction movement. Now, farmers are vying to keep the fruits of their struggle as seeds or to exchange them for agricultural implements, and are organizing mutual aid teams to expand production. In order to strive for an average increase of twenty to thirty catties of grain per mu compared to last year, farmers of all ethnic groups throughout Xinjiang have universally established production increase plans.
    ▲ The chemical fertilizers and cake fertilizers prepared by the East China Cooperative General Office and cooperative societies in various places have exceeded 185% of the same period last year. The fertilizers needed by farmers for spring plowing can be fully supplied. This year, the East China region's fertilizer loans and all fertilizer supply work are uniformly managed by the state-entrusted cooperative societies. The method of supplying fertilizer by the East China region's cooperative societies this year mainly focuses on storing actual goods and preselling; at the same time, when selling fertilizers for cash, it is also stipulated that prices be set in Renminbi or in kind to avoid the accumulation of funds. Installment purchase orders mainly promote short-term installment business; for example, when farmers purchase fertilizers on credit for use in cotton fields, they do not necessarily have to repay with cotton in the future, but can repay with rapeseed or other early-harvest crops, which can reduce the burden on cooperative societies.
    ▲ Cooperative societies in various parts of northern Jiangsu are actively supplying fertilizers to farmers for spring plowing. The fertilizers operated by cooperative societies in the northern Jiangsu region this year, calculated on the basis of 40 catties of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, are sufficient to supply the fertilizer needs of 15 million mu of cultivated land, which is more than three times that of last year. The funds operated by cooperative societies throughout the region for fertilizers in the first half of this year have increased by nearly three times compared to last year.
    ▲ The China National Grain Corporation's Central South Region Company is transferring large quantities of grain both within and outside the region. In January and February, the Central South Region transferred rice, wheat, and flour to North China, East China, Northeast China, and other places, completing 90% of the original plan. State-owned grain companies in various provinces have also transported large quantities of grain to industrial and mining areas and special product areas for cotton, tea, and tobacco. Xiang rice is being continuously transported to various parts of Guangdong Province and the cities of Guangzhou and Wuhan. Grain prices throughout the region are basically stable.
    ▲ State-owned trading companies and cooperative societies in various parts of Henan Province are processing and manufacturing agricultural implements and fertilizers in large quantities. The processing of agricultural implements and fertilizers is mostly based on the principle of purchasing raw materials locally, processing them locally, and supplying them locally, in order to facilitate meeting the needs of farmers in various places. Therefore, the processed finished products are very popular among farmers. Cooperative societies in various parts of Henan Province have completed more than half of the annual fertilizer procurement plan. Many regions are now adopting methods such as cash sales, presales, ordering, and exchange of goods to supply fertilizers to farmers.
    ▲ In order to strive for a bumper harvest this year, various parts of Hunan are continuing to build water conservancy projects. Since last October, Lan Shan County has been carrying out land reform while simultaneously engaging in the intense construction of water conservancy projects. After Tang Shilin (cotton planting model), a labor model from Datong Township in the county, and his son Tang Yuwen (bandit suppression model) actively took the lead in finding an underground water source from the valley, the Lan Shan County People's Government lent them two million yuan to develop the water source. After three months of effort, the Tang family and local people blasted the rocks open, and mountain water gushed out, which can irrigate more than 800 mu of land. Now they are excavating a canal more than 1,000 meters long, which, when completed, can increase grain production by more than 100,000 catties.

    经济简讯
    ▲新疆省各地冰雪渐融，南疆吐鲁番盆地的农民已开犁春耕。新疆省农村去冬今春曾普遍实行减租，农村中封建势力已被削弱，农民增产热情提高，而且各地在减租运动中都得到了一部分极为需要的生产资料。现在，农民纷纷把分得的斗争果实留做种籽或换买农具，组织互助组扩大生产。为了争取今年每亩地平均较去年增产二十斤至三十斤粮食，全疆各族农民都普遍订了增产计划。
    ▲华东合作总社及各地合作社准备的化学肥料和饼肥，已超过去年同期的百分之一百八十五以上。农民春耕所需肥料已可充分供应。华东区今年肥料贷款及全部肥料供应工作，由国家委托合作社统一经营。华东区合作社今年供应肥料方法以存实预售为主；同时，在现售肥料时，又规定以人民币或实物作价，以免积压资金。赊销订购以推行短期赊销业务为主；例如，农民赊购施用于棉田的肥料时，将来不一定以棉花偿还，而可以菜籽或其他早收作物偿还，这样做可以减轻合作社的负担。
    ▲苏北各地合作社积极供应肥料给农民进行春耕。苏北区合作社今年经营的肥料，以每亩耕地施肥四十斤计算，足可供给一千五百万亩耕地施肥的需要，这比去年增加了三倍以上。全区合作社今年上半年经营肥料的资金，比去年增加近三倍。
    ▲中国粮食公司中南区公司正向区内区外大量调运粮食。一、二月份中南区调到华北、华东、东北等地的大米、小麦、面粉，完成原定计划百分之九十。各省国营粮食公司也已把大批粮食运到工矿区，棉、茶、烟特产区去，湘米正源源地运到广东省各地和广州、武汉两市。全区粮价基本上稳定。
    ▲河南省各地国营贸易公司和合作社，大量加工制造农具和肥料。农具、肥料加工工作，大都以就地收购原料、就地加工、就地供应为原则，以便于适应各地农民的需要，因此，加工制造的成品，很受农民欢迎。河南省各地合作社，已完成全年肥料收购计划的一半以上。许多地区现正采用现售、预售、订货、实物交换等办法，把肥料供应农民。
    ▲为了争取今年的大丰收，湖南各地正在继续兴修水利。蓝山县自去年十月开始，就在一面进行土地改革，一面紧张地兴修水利。这个县大同乡劳动模范唐士林（植棉模范）和他的儿子唐郁文（清匪肃特模范）积极带头从山谷里找出一道地下水源后，蓝山县人民政府便贷给他们二百万元，进行开发水源的工作。经三个月的努力，唐家父子和当地群众把岩石炸开，山水汹涌而出，可灌地八百多亩。现在他们又在开掘一条一千多公尺长的渠道，修成后可增产粮食十多万斤。
