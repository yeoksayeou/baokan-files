    March 9th is the sixtieth birthday of Comrade Mátyás Rákosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party. Rákosi is an outstanding fighter of the Hungarian working class and the international working class. Throughout his life, he has fought unremittingly for the freedom and happiness of the Hungarian people, for the victory of the working-class cause, and for world peace.

    Rákosi was born on March 9, 1892. At that time, Hungary was still part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the country was beginning to move towards industrialization; feudalism was ostensibly abolished, but the peasants still groaned under the exploitation of the large landowners. The workers' and peasants' movements against Austrian plunder and oppression were then developing vigorously.

    Rákosi joined the workers' movement in middle school and became a member of the Social Democratic Party. Around 1910, he studied at the Oriental Commercial Academy in Budapest and actively led the student movement. He received a public scholarship for his excellent academic performance to study in Hamburg, Germany, and London, England, where he continued to participate in the workers' movement. When he returned to his country in 1914, he already had rich experience and theoretical knowledge of the international working-class struggle. When the First World War broke out, Rákosi was conscripted into the army and transferred to the Eastern Front, where he was captured by the Tsarist Russian army in April 1915. In the prisoner-of-war camp in Siberia, he continued to study Marxism-Leninism and maintained contact with many exiled Russian socialists. The great October Socialist Revolution freed him. He returned to his country in May 1918 to participate in the domestic revolutionary movement.

    On November 20, 1918, the Hungarian Communist Party was founded. Comrade Rákosi was one of the creators of the Party. He made significant contributions while carrying out the tasks of Provincial Committee Secretary and other duties. On March 21, 1919, the Hungarian Social Democratic Party merged into the Communist Party. With the unanimous support of the working people, the newly established Socialist Party took control of the state power and established the Hungarian Republic of Councils. Comrade Rákosi was the youngest People's Commissar in the council at that time, made valuable contributions to organizational work, and personally participated in the fight against imperialism and domestic enemies. The Republic of Councils failed under the pressure of domestic and foreign enemies and the betrayal of the right-wing Social Democrats. Rákosi went to the Soviet Union via Austria and Germany and participated in the leadership of the international working-class movement, serving as the Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. Under the guidance of Lenin, he went to Czechoslovakia, Germany, Italy, and France, devoting himself to consolidating the work of the parties in various countries with the lessons of Lenin and Stalin and the rich experience of the Bolshevik Party.

    In 1924, Rákosi returned to Hungary and immediately reorganized the Party organization and launched a struggle against the reactionary ruling class. He organized the First Congress of the Hungarian Communist Party, which was held in Vienna in August 1925. He returned to his country in September and was arrested by the Horthy government, the reactionary ruling group at the time. Upon hearing this news, progressives around the world were extremely indignant and protested the atrocities of the Hungarian reactionary rulers of the Horthy government, demanding the release of Comrade Rákosi. Telegrams and letters of protest poured in from all over the world, and the protest movement spread to countries around the world. Famous French writers Barbusse and Romain Rolland participated in the movement to rescue Rákosi.

    In the court of the reactionary ruling group, Rákosi firmly and faithfully adhered to Marxism-Leninism, demonstrating the glorious example of a Communist fighting for the truth under the shadow of the class enemy's gallows. This illegal trial of Rákosi fully exposed the corruption, stupidity, and weakness within the Hungarian counter-revolutionary group. The right-wing Social Democrats also participated in this shameful trial as accomplices. Rákosi and his comrades heroically refuted the enemy's slanders and lies in the reactionary court. Rákosi did not defend himself; he accused the counter-revolutionary group and imperialism. He said, "I don't need to defend myself; all my activities are to organize the Communist Party." He and his comrades fought in the enemy's court as if on the front line. He turned from being accused to being the accuser, relentlessly exposing the Horthy ruling apparatus's conspiracy to infringe on the rights of the working people and carry out anti-Soviet and anti-Communist activities under the guise of this illegal trial. At the same time, the world's protest movement grew even stronger.

    "Committees to Rescue Rákosi" were established in many places. The workers' movement in Hungary also combined the struggle against poverty and unemployment with the movement to support Rákosi, launching a fierce offensive against the counter-revolutionary rulers. Under the pressure of the people at home and abroad, the Hungarian counter-revolutionary group was forced to abandon its attempt to sentence Rákosi to death and instead sentenced him to eight and a half years in prison.

    In prison, Rákosi continued to fight against the reactionary government that oppressed the people and worked tirelessly to consolidate the Party. When his term expired, the Horthy government still dared not release him. In February 1935, he was charged again with having served as a People's Commissar. In court, Rákosi solemnly explained the policies of the Hungarian Republic of Councils. He stated before the Hungarian working people that the Hungarian Communist Party was the glorious heir to the historical tradition of striving for freedom. The reactionary ruling group shamelessly sentenced Rákosi to life imprisonment.

    People all over the world responded to this shameful verdict with an even stronger protest movement. Protest rallies were held in factories throughout Hungary. Laboring people in many countries, including the Soviet Union, France, Belgium, the United States, and Czechoslovakia, held rallies and passed resolutions demanding the release of Rákosi. Many famous writers from various countries participated in this protest movement. Under the rescue efforts of the Soviet people and the people of other countries, Rákosi was released from prison on October 30, 1940. On November 2, he crossed the border at Uzhok to the Soviet Union.

    During his stay in the Soviet Union, Rákosi continued to work hard for the liberation of the Hungarian working people. He sent excellent fighters back to the country to lead the Party's underground struggle and anti-fascist guerrilla warfare. The Soviet army, in its pursuit of fleeing Nazi bandits, liberated all of Hungary. In the spring of 1945, Rákosi returned to his country and became a leader in building a new democratic Hungary.

    In the name of the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, he put forward the slogan "Land! Bread! Freedom!" to the people of the whole country, calling on the people of the whole country to take up arms. At the Party Congress on February 11, 1945, he said, "Now, a new era has begun. We must turn promises into action."

    On Rákosi's motion, the Provisional National Assembly passed the Land Reform Decree on March 15, 1945, ending the large estate system in Hungary. In May of the same year, the Hungarian Communist Party held its first National Congress in 25 years in an illegal state. Rákosi emphasized that national construction was the primary task at present and put forward the slogan "Everything for building the motherland!" He said, "The Hungarian Communists must, in the future, as in the past, stand at the forefront, spare no effort, disregard sacrifice, and fight for the construction of the motherland." In the great construction work, the Hungarian Communists, under the leadership of Rákosi, put this great call into practice.

    Rákosi led the Party and the domestic democratic forces to wage a relentless struggle against the counter-revolutionary activities of the bourgeois remnants. When the counter-revolutionaries attempted to sabotage the Land Reform Decree, he replied, "We will never return the land," his resolute assertion further enhanced the confidence of the laboring peasants in their struggle. In order to defeat the counter-revolutionaries' economic sabotage, he resolutely curbed inflation. In early August 1946, the new stable currency, the Forint, was successfully issued throughout the country. He said, "The Forint is stable, and we must do our best to maintain it to consolidate the national economy."

    At the Party's Third Congress, Rákosi suggested formulating a three-year plan for the development of the national economy. He also put forward the slogan "Resolutely drive the enemies of the people out of the United Front" at this congress. He gave some specific instructions in order to further develop the country and consolidate the power of the working class. He said, "We believe that our cause will surely be victorious. We know that only people's democracy can guarantee the development of Hungary's various productive forces and improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people. Our road is the road of people's democracy, the road of domestic peace and domestic unity."

    In December 1946, the State Security Agency discovered a large-scale counter-revolutionary conspiracy. Under the leadership of Comrade Rákosi, the Hungarian Communist Party concentrated all its efforts to expose this conspiracy. In the year following this decisive struggle, the Hungarian people defeated and expelled those representatives of the exploiting classes and their followers who were placed in power in various places, winning brilliant victories.

    The Hungarian Communist Party won a decisive victory in the 1947 general election, thus enabling it to begin efforts to unify the working-class parties. In June 1948, Party organizations across the country merged with the Social Democratic Party, forming the Hungarian Working People's Party—a unified Bolshevik-style party of the working class. Rákosi was elected General Secretary of the Party. At the merger congress of the two parties, Rákosi said, "We are full of confidence that all the work we have done since liberation and will do in the future is supported by every patriotic person in the country. The principle of every action we take is to advance the country and serve the people. This is the source of our strength and inevitable victory. And another important principle in all our work is: We must do what we say."

    The Hungarian working people hailed the decrees nationalizing large enterprises and mines, and with the same enthusiasm, they supported the government's judgment against counter-revolutionaries, especially the treason case of the American spy Mindszenty. In the spring of 1949, the People's Independence Front, which united the Hungarian democratic forces, elected Rákosi as its chairman. Soon after, 99.5 percent of the five million voters voted in favor of the People's Front, demonstrating an unprecedentedly powerful unity of the Hungarian people. On August 17, 1949, the Hungarian Parliament passed the state's fundamental law—the Constitution—drafted by Rákosi.

    At the parliament that adopted the Constitution, Rákosi said, "The Soviet army liberated us, and the great friend of the Hungarian people—Stalin—has given and is giving us all kinds of assistance. This is the starting point for every success and every achievement of our people's democratic regime. As we adopt the Constitution today, this is a new milestone in the progress of our people's democratic construction. We will once again express our heartfelt gratitude to the great Soviet Union for its help and support."

    Throughout the entire development of liberated Hungary, the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union can be seen everywhere. The Soviet Union was the first to help Hungary in its national construction work, and since then, it has provided assistance in political, economic, and cultural aspects, and sent construction experts. In 1948, the Hungarian-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance—the most important document in the history of the Hungarian people—was negotiated and signed in Moscow, with Rákosi participating in the negotiations and signing as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. This treaty enabled Hungary to participate in the global struggle to defend peace, enabling Hungary to embark on the road of building socialism and become an equal member of the world peace and democracy camp.

    At the end of 1949, the Hungarian people completed the three-year plan for developing the national economy seven months ahead of schedule. The five-year plan, drafted under the leadership of Rákosi, began to be implemented. Rákosi once said, "In our country, labor is a matter of honor." It is in the spirit of this sentence that the Hungarian working people, with new socialist labor enthusiasm, are launching production competitions everywhere, striving to build socialism and defend peace.

    In the great work of building socialist industry and transforming the country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, Rákosi successfully solved many major problems. He tirelessly combined the struggle to defend peace with the great cause of building socialism. Rákosi wrote in "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" on December 9, 1949, "We will continue to fight victoriously in the struggle to defend peace, strengthen the forces of socialist construction, and smash the imperialist conspiracy plans, consolidate the people's democratic regime and the peace front guarded by the Hungarian Working People's Party." At the Second National Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party in February 1951, Rákosi said, "We Hungarian working people can guarantee that we will continue to fight tirelessly, faithfully, and unsparingly on the front of defending peace. Whenever it is necessary to sacrifice for the great cause of peace, we will bravely move forward!"

    Under the leadership of the Labor People's Party and Rákosi, the Hungarian people are fighting to realize the expanded five-year plan and build socialism to further improve the living welfare of the laboring people. They are also united like a giant in the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union to defend peace and attack the attacks and provocations of imperialism and its lackeys. (Attached picture)

    庆祝拉科西同志六十寿辰
    本报特稿
    三月九日是匈牙利劳动人民党总书记玛吉阿斯·拉科西同志的六十寿辰。拉科西是匈牙利工人阶级和国际工人阶级杰出的战士。他一生为了匈牙利人民的自由和幸福，为了工人阶级事业的胜利，为了世界和平，坚持不懈地战斗着。
    拉科西生于一八九二年三月九日。那时，匈牙利还是奥匈帝国的一部分，国家正开始走向工业化；封建主义在表面上被废除了，然而农民仍在大地主的剥削下呻吟着。反对奥地利掠夺和压榨的工人运动和农民运动当时已有澎湃的发展。
    拉科西在中学时代就参加工人运动，并成为社会民主党党员。一九一○年前后他在布达佩斯东方商业学院读书，积极领导学生运动；以学习成绩优异获公费赴德国汉堡和英国伦敦读书，在两地继续参加工人运动。一九一四年返国时，他已有了丰富的国际工人阶级斗争经验和理论知识。第一次世界大战爆发，拉科西被征召入伍，调赴东线作战，于一九一五年四月为帝俄军队俘虏。在西伯利亚的俘虏营里继续研究马克思、列宁主义，并与许多被流放的俄罗斯社会主义者保持接触。伟大的十月社会主义革命使他自由了。他于一九一八年五月返国参加了国内的革命运动。
    一九一八年十一月二十日，匈牙利共产党成立。拉科西同志是党的创造者之一。在执行省委书记和其他任务时，他有过重大的贡献。一九一九年三月二十一日匈牙利社会民主党并入共产党内，在劳动人民一致支援下，新成立的社会主义党掌握了国家政权，建立了匈牙利共和国议会，拉科西同志是当时议会中最年青的人民委员，在组织工作上有过珍贵的贡献，并曾亲自参加了反对帝国主义和国内敌人的战斗。共和国议会在国内外敌人和右翼社会党人出卖的压力下失败了。拉科西经奥地利和德国到了苏联，参加了国际工人阶级运动的领导工作，担任共产国际执行委员会书记。在列宁的指导下，他曾到过捷克斯洛伐克、德国、意大利和法国，以列宁和斯大林的教训和布尔什维克党的丰富的经验致力于巩固各国党的工作。
    一九二四年，拉科西回到匈牙利，立即整顿党的组织，向反动统治阶级展开了斗争。他组织了一九二五年八月在维也纳召开的匈共第一次代表大会。他于九月返国，被当时的反动统治集团霍尔第政府逮捕入狱。全世界各地进步人士听到这一消息，愤慨异常，纷纷抗议匈牙利反动统治者霍尔第政府的暴行，要求释放拉科西同志的电报、信件自各地如雪片飞来，抗议运动普遍到世界各国。法国名作家巴比塞、罗曼罗兰等都参加了营救拉科西的运动。
    在反动统治集团的法庭上，拉科西坚定地忠实于马克思、列宁主义，表现了共产党人在阶级敌人的绞架的阴影下为坚持真理而斗争的光辉榜样。对拉科西这一非法的审讯，充分暴露了匈牙利反革命集团内部的腐朽、愚蠢和软弱。右翼社会党人作为帮凶也参加了这一可耻的审讯。拉科西和他的战友们在反动的法庭上英勇地驳斥了敌人的中伤和谰言。拉科西没有为自己辩护，他控诉了反革命集团和帝国主义。他说：“我没有必要为自己辩护，我的全部活动就是为了组织共产党。”他和他的战友像在前线一样地在敌人法庭上坚持战斗。他从被控告的身份成为控告者，他无情地揭露了霍尔第统治机构藉口这一非法审讯侵犯劳动人民权利的阴谋和进行反苏反共的活动。同时，世界的抗议运动更为高涨，
    “援救拉科西委员会”在许多地方建立起来，匈牙利国内的工人运动，也把反对贫穷反对失业的斗争和声援拉科西的运动结合起来，向反革命统治者展开汹涌的攻势。匈牙利反革命集团在国内外人民的压力下，被迫放弃了判处拉科西死刑的企图，而改判有期徒刑八年半。
    拉科西在监狱中继续战斗反对压迫人民的反动政府，为了巩固党进行了不懈的工作。在他徒刑期满时，霍尔第政府仍不敢把他释放，一九三五年二月，又以他曾充当人民委员的罪名提出控告。拉科西在法庭上严正地说明了匈牙利共和国议会的政策，他在匈牙利劳动人民面前表示，匈牙利共产党是争取自由的历史传统的光辉的继承人。反动统治集团竟无耻地判处拉科西以无期徒刑。
    全世界人民以更高涨的抗议运动回答了这一可耻的判决。匈牙利各工厂中都举行了抗议集会。苏联、法国、比利时、美国、捷克斯洛伐克等许多国家的劳动人民都举行了集会，通过决议要求释放拉科西，各国许多名作家都参加了这一抗议运动。在苏联人民和各国人民的营救下，拉科西于一九四○年十月三十日出狱。十一月二日他经过边界乌兹索克地方到了苏联。
    拉科西在苏联伫留时期，继续为解放匈牙利劳动人民而努力地工作着。他派遣了优秀的战士返国领导党的地下斗争和反法西斯游击战争。苏军为追歼逃窜的纳粹匪徒，解放了匈牙利全境。一九四五年春天，拉科西返国，并成为建设新的民主匈牙利的领导者。
    他以匈共总书记的名义向全国人民提出“土地、面包！自由！”的口号，号召全国人民武装起来。他在一九四五年二月十一日党的大会上说：“现在，新的时代开始了。我们要将诺言变成行动。”
    由拉科西的动议，临时国民议会于一九四五年三月十五日通过了土地改革法令，从此结束了匈牙利的大庄园制度。同年五月，匈共举行了二十五年来处于不合法地位的第一次全国代表大会，拉科西强调指出国家建设工作为当前首要任务，并提出“一切为了建设祖国！”的口号。他说：“匈牙利共产党人在将来也必须像过去一样地站在最前列，决不吝惜力量，不顾虑牺牲，为建设祖国而斗争。”在伟大的建设工作中，匈牙利共产党人在拉科西领导下实践了这一伟大的号召。
    拉科西领导党和国内民主力量向资产阶级残余分子的反革命活动进行了无情的斗争。当反革命分子企图破坏土地改革法令时，他曾回答说，“我们决不退还土地”，他的坚决主张更提高了劳动农民斗争的信心。为了击溃反革命分子在经济方面的破坏，他坚决地制止了通货膨胀。一九四六年八月初，新的稳定的货币——福林，顺利发行全国。他说：“福林是稳定的，我们必须尽力维持它以巩固国家经济。”
    在党的第三次代表大会上，拉科西建议制订发展国民经济的三年计划，他并在这一次大会上提出了“坚决从联合阵线中驱逐人民的敌人”这一口号，他曾指示一些具体任务，以求得国家进一步发展，巩固工人阶级的政权。他说：“我们相信我们的事业必将胜利。我们知道，唯有人民民主才能保证匈牙利各种生产力的发展，提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平。我们的道路是人民民主的道路，是国内和平和国内团结的道路。”
    一九四六年十二月，国家保卫机关发现了大规模的反革命阴谋。匈牙利共产党在拉科西同志领导下集中一切力量揭发了这个阴谋。在这一个有决定意义的斗争以后一年中，匈牙利人民在各地都击败了而且驱逐了那些剥削阶级派在政权中的代表和他们的追随者，获得了辉煌的胜利。
    匈共在一九四七年大选中获得决定性的胜利，因而能够开始统一工人阶级政党的努力。一九四八年六月，全国各地党组织都和社会民主党进行了合并，成立了匈牙利劳动人民党——一个统一的工人阶级的布尔什维克式的政党，拉科西被选为党的总书记。在两党合并大会上，拉科西说：“我们满怀信心，所有我们在解放以来和今后要做的工作，都受到国内每一个爱国的人民的支持。我们每一个行动的原则都是为了使国家前进和为人民服务。这就是我们有力量和必然胜利的泉源。而在我们一切工作中的另一个重要原则就是：我们说到就要做到。”
    匈牙利劳动人民欢呼将大企业、矿山收归国有的法令，并以同样的热情拥护政府对反革命分子特别是对美国间谍明曾蒂叛国案的判决。一九四九年春天，团结匈牙利民主力量的人民独立阵线选举拉科西任主席，不久之后，五百万选民中百分之九十九点五的人都投票拥护人民阵线，表示了匈牙利人民空前未有的有力的团结。一九四九年八月十七日，匈牙利议会通过了拉科西制订的国家根本大法——宪法。
    在通过宪法的议会上，拉科西说：“苏联军队解放了我们，匈牙利人民伟大的友人——斯大林曾经和正在给我们以各种援助，这是我们人民民主政权获得每一次成功和每一个成就的起点。当我们今天通过宪法，这是我们人民民主建设前进的新的里程碑，我们将再一次向给我们帮助和支持的伟大的苏联致以衷心的感谢。”
    在解放了的匈牙利全部发展过程中，随时随地都可以看到苏联的兄弟般的援助。苏联最先帮助了匈牙利国家建设工作，此后并在政治、经济和文化各方面给以援助，并派遣了建设方面的专家。一九四八年匈苏友好互助同盟条约——匈牙利人民历史上最重要的文件，在莫斯科谈判的时候，拉科西以部长会议副主席的资格参加谈判和签字。这一条约使匈牙利参加了全世界保卫和平的斗争，使匈牙利开始走向建设社会主义的道路并成为世界和平民主阵营中平等的一员。
    匈牙利人民于一九四九年年底提前七个月完成了三年发展国民经济计划。由拉科西领导制订的五年计划开始实行了。拉科西曾说过：“在我们国家里，劳动是荣誉的事情。”正是本着这一句话的精神，匈牙利劳动人民以新的社会主义劳动热情，到处展开生产竞赛，为建设社会主义和保卫和平而努力。
    在建设社会主义工业和将国家从落后农业国转变为进步工业国的巨大工作中，拉科西胜利地解决了许多重大问题，他不知疲倦地将保卫和平的斗争和建设社会主义的伟大事业紧密地结合起来。拉科西在一九四九年十二月九日的“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”上著文说：“我们在保卫和平、增强社会主义建设的力量、粉碎帝国主义的阴谋计划的斗争中将继续进行胜利战斗，巩固人民民主政权和由匈牙利劳动人民党护卫着的和平阵线。”一九五一年二月在匈牙利劳动人民党第二届全国代表大会上，拉科西说：“我们匈牙利劳动人民能够保证我们将继续不懈地、忠诚地并且不吝惜力量地在保卫和平战线上战斗，任何需要为伟大的和平事业献身的时候，我们都将勇往直前！”
    匈牙利人民在劳动人民党和拉科西领导下，正为实现扩大的五年计划和建设社会主义进一步提高劳动人民的生活福利而斗争，他们并且团结得像一个巨人似的在苏联为首的和平民主阵营中为保卫和平而斗争，打击帝国主义及其走狗的攻击和挑衅。（附图片）
