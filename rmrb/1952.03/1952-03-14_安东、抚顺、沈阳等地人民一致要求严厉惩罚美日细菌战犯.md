Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 12th: People in areas of Liaodong Province, including Andong City, Kuandian County, Fushun City, and the suburbs of Shenyang City, where American invaders spread bacterial insects, are angrily protesting the towering crimes of the US government in slaughtering the Chinese people and violating Chinese airspace. They unanimously demand severe punishment for the American and Japanese war criminals who used bacteriological weapons. The local people have also been urgently mobilized, and with the assistance of a large number of epidemic prevention personnel sent by the people's governments at all levels, they have bravely thrown themselves into the battle to exterminate the disease-spreading insects.

Sun Leren, a resident of Langtou District, Andong City, accused: "At noon on March 4, I personally saw six American planes flying over Pingzhong Street, and I saw two black objects falling from the planes. Subsequently, I found piles of dense flies, mosquitoes, and spiders in my residence and nearby fields. These poisonous insects are the same as those found on the Korean battlefield as reported in the newspapers. Obviously, the American devils want to use these bloodless things to slaughter the Chinese people. We must never agree to this. We demand severe sanctions and punishment for the American war criminals who use bacteriological weapons to kill people!" Song Chuan-yi, an old farmer from the eastern suburbs of Andong City, said angrily after carefully observing the captured poisonous insects: "I have lived for seventy years and have never seen such insects. The American devils are inhuman beasts. They spread poisonous insects and shamelessly try to deny it. For the sake of our future generations, they must be severely punished!" Wang Yupu, a farmer from Jiapigou District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, said: "On the morning of March 4, American planes circled in the high altitude in this area. When I went out to take a look in the afternoon, I found many poisonous insects scattered on the snow. If these poisonous insects were not dropped by the American devils, where did they come from? The American devils cannot deny it under any circumstances!" After killing a large number of poisonous insects, more than 300 farmers in Dongmenwai Village in the district held a condemnation meeting against the crime of spreading bacteria by American invaders. At the meeting, everyone unanimously stated: "We are irreconcilable with the American invaders. We will never give up until the American war criminals are severely punished!"

Residents of Nanhua Street, Nanhua District, Fushun City, immediately convened an emergency meeting when they found poisonous insects scattered by American aerial bandits all over the vicinity of their residences. More than 400 male and female residents voluntarily signed up to participate in the work of exterminating the poisonous insects. Barber Fang Junshan is a survivor of the "Pingdingshan Massacre" perpetrated by the Japanese invaders in Fushun City. The American aerial bandits have also spread a large number of bacterial poisonous insects around Pingdingshan, and his heart is filled with grief and anger. He said decisively: "We must avenge both new and old hatreds! The American devils are harboring Japanese bacterial warfare criminals to slaughter us again. This is even more vicious than the 'Pingdingshan Massacre' back then. But the Chinese people are no longer the Chinese people of that time. We will definitely be able to defeat the American devils' bacteriological warfare!" Hou Chunhe, a farmer in the area of the city suburbs of Fushun where poisonous insects were found, said when talking about the crime of spreading bacteria by the American devils: "Even small children who know a little bit about things hate the American devils. We must demand a blood debt from these bloodless murderers!"

Many villages and hamlets in Jiuzhan Sub-district, Shenjingzi District, on the outskirts of Shenyang City, discovered poisonous insects dropped by American planes. The farmers in the district all hate the shameless crimes of the American invaders. Chen Huanzhang, a farmer and family member of a volunteer soldier in Gaokan Village, gritted his teeth after discovering poisonous insects in his vegetable garden and said: "The American devils are really crueler than wolves and more poisonous than poisonous insects. They actually spread these insects to poison us! I will write to my son immediately and tell him to step up killing the enemy and severely strike the American bandits!" Zhang Zhenfa, a well-known agricultural labor model in Shenyang City who lives in Gaokan Village, organized all the farmers in the village to help epidemic prevention personnel exterminate bacterial poisonous insects. He said: "The American devils want to scare us by spreading bacteria, but they can't scare us. We have already defeated the Japanese devils' bacteriological warfare, and we will definitely be able to defeat the American devils' bacteriological warfare even more!"

    安东、抚顺、沈阳等地人民一致要求严厉惩罚美日细菌战犯
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】辽东省安东市，宽甸县以及抚顺市和沈阳市郊等发现美国侵略者撒布细菌毒虫地区的人民，愤怒抗议美国政府屠杀中国人民、侵犯中国领空的滔天罪行，一致要求严惩使用细菌武器的美国和日本战争罪犯。当地人民并已紧张动员起来，在各级人民政府派去的大批防疫人员协助下，英勇地投入了扑灭传播细菌的毒虫的战斗。
    安东市浪头区居民孙乐仁控诉说：“三月四日中午，我亲眼看到六架美国飞机在我们平中街的上空飞过，并看见从飞机上落下两个黑色物体，随后我就在我的住宅和附近田地中发现成堆密集的苍蝇、蚊子和蜘蛛。这些毒虫和报上刊载朝鲜战场上所发现的一样，显然是美国鬼子想用这些杀人不见血的东西来屠杀中国人民。我们绝不能答应，我们要求严厉制裁和惩办用细菌武器杀人的美国战争罪犯！”安东市东郊的一位老农民宋传义在仔细观察了捕到的毒虫后愤怒地说：“我活了七十岁，从来没见过这样的虫子。美国鬼子是没有人性的畜生，他撒了毒虫还无耻地狡赖。为了咱们的后一代，必须严厉地惩罚他们！”辽东省宽甸县夹皮沟区农民王玉璞说：“三月四日上午，美国飞机在这一带高空盘旋。下午我出门看看，就发现雪地上散布着许多毒虫。雪地上发现这些毒虫，不是美国鬼子丢的是那里来的？美国鬼子要想抵赖，万万不能！”该区东门外村三百多名农民在扑杀了大批毒虫后，举行了对美国侵略者撒布细菌罪行的控诉大会。会上大家一致表示：“我们与美国侵略者誓不两立，不严厉惩罚美国战争罪犯，誓不甘休！”
    抚顺市南花园区南花园街的居民，在发现住宅附近遍布美国空中强盗所撒下的毒虫时，立即召开紧急大会，四百多名男女居民自动报名参加扑灭毒虫的工作。理发工人方俊山是从日寇在抚顺市制造的“平顶山大屠杀惨案”中死里逃生的人，而美国空中强盗又在平顶山周围撒下了大量细菌毒虫，心中悲愤已极，他斩钉截铁地说：“新仇旧恨我们都要报！美国鬼子豢养日本细菌战犯又来屠杀我们，这比当年‘平顶山惨案’还恶毒。可是中国人民再也不是那时的中国人民了，我们一定能够战胜美国鬼子的细菌战！”该市市郊发现毒虫地区的农民侯春和谈到美国鬼子撒布细菌的罪行时说：“如今稍为懂点事的小孩子也恨透了美国鬼子，我们一定要向这些杀人不见血的凶手讨还血债！”
    沈阳市郊深井子区旧站分区许多村屯发现了美机投下的毒虫。该区农民无不痛恨美国侵略者的无耻罪行。高坎村农民、志愿军家属陈焕章在他家的菜园子里发现了毒虫后咬牙切齿地说：“美国鬼子真是比狼还狠，比毒虫还毒，竟撒放这些虫子来毒害我们！我马上给我儿子写信，叫他加劲杀敌人，狠狠打击美国强盗！”住在高坎村的沈阳市著名农业劳动模范张振发把全村农民都组织起来，协助防疫人员扑灭细菌毒虫。他说：“美国鬼子想用撒细菌来吓唬我们是吓唬不了的，我们已经打垮了日本鬼子的细菌战，我们也一定更能够打垮美国鬼子的细菌战！”
