    No Passing Without Honest Confession!
    ——Records of Tianjin Feilong Rubber Factory and Other Factories' Employees Reviewing Capitalists' Confession Materials
    The Tianjin Municipal Savings Inspection Committee is currently using a "Five-Anti Conclusion Report Form" to process illegal industrialists and businessmen who have confessed and repented. Every illegal capitalist, during the conclusion process, must go through an important step—honestly confessing their illegal activities and having them reviewed and approved by the employees. The following is a report from a Tianjin Daily reporter on the situation of employees from the 11th District Feilong Rubber Factory and other factories reviewing capitalists' confession materials in recent days.
    Workers in each factory temporarily cleaned out the workshop or counter room to use as meeting places, and posters with slogans like "Only confession offers a way out" and "Obey the leadership of the working class" were pasted on the walls. All employees sat on one side, and on the other side was the review committee (or review小组) elected by the employees—including Communist Party, Communist Youth League, and trade union cadres, staff, veteran technicians, and female workers.
    The capitalists came in and began confessing their crimes of tax evasion, bribery, and theft of state assets. The review committee members constantly flipped through and checked the capitalists' confession materials; every employee listened carefully, not letting a single word go by.
    After the confession, if employees found discrepancies with the information they had, or if they had any doubts, they immediately raised them and questioned the capitalists.
    The employees of Guoguang Rubber Factory questioned, "Why is the rubber content of the batch of green running shoes made for the Railway Bureau's Ministry of Public Security only 40%?"
    The employees of Wanyuan Rubber Factory pointed out, "There's another tax you haven't mentioned!"
    The capitalists had to truthfully explain these issues. When the capitalists attributed the corner-cutting to "inexperience in cost accounting," they were immediately refuted by the employees. If the review couldn't be completed on the same day, the employees preferred to continue the review the next day, never being careless. The workers said: Since you have broken the law, you should bow your head and admit your guilt. If your attitude is not honest, don't expect to pass.
    At the review meetings, the employees of each factory also accused the capitalists of their crimes—their outrageous attacks on the state and the working class.
    "At the time of liberation, the factory only had a small boiler and a few rollers; before long, we added a 14-inch rubber mixing machine, a cloth scraping machine, and two slurry pots, and also built a building and a warehouse... These are all the result of the workers' blood and sweat, and the government's support!"
    "However, when you encountered some temporary difficulties in 1950, you hid the money and cried poor, reaching out with both hands: one hand reaching out to the government, and the other hand reaching out to the workers. The government took care of you; the workers voluntarily reduced their wages by half and even lent you the millet stored in the savings club to help you get through, so we have been good to you!"
    "But that was not enough. You still tried every means to evade taxes, cut corners, and steal state assets. Do you still have a conscience?"
    These are the words of Chen Wenqi, a worker at Guoguang Rubber Factory.
    Many workers, due to long-term oppression and abuse, didn't dare to speak out in the past, and were even afraid to see the capitalists. Through this movement, their awareness has been raised, and they have generated the courage and spirit they should have, daring to confront and denounce the capitalists' crimes. Wang Shuqin, a female worker at Guoguang Rubber Factory, accused, "After liberation, female workers were not treated for illnesses, and if they took a day off, they would be fined three days' wages. Once, I cut my hand while cutting sponge soles, and it was so painful that it was festering, but I had to endure it and keep working."
    Many senior staff members joined the workers in exposing the capitalists' crimes and conspiracies. In the past, most of them were tightly held by the capitalists, and there was some distance between them and the workers. In this movement, after unity and education, they became aware and returned to the team. For example, Zhou Zhichao, a salesman at Feilong Rubber Factory, and Li Zhengyuan, an accountant at Wanyuan Rubber Factory, actively participated in the exposure work. Now, at the review meetings, workers and staff members are asking the capitalists face-to-face:
    "Dividing workers into day laborers, piece-rate workers, outworkers, and temporary workers with different piece rates, isn't that intentionally undermining the unity of the workers?" the workers asked.
    "What did you mean by changing the formula without letting me and the workers know?" the technicians asked.
    "Secretly giving us extra money, isn't this dividing the employees?" the senior staff members asked.
    Every fact raised by the employees was ironclad. The capitalists had no answer, and could only repeatedly say, "Yes, I admit it," "This is my mistake." The exposure and accusations of the broad masses of employees suppressed the arrogance of the illegal capitalists, and they bowed their heads in the face of truth.
    As a result of the review, the capitalists' confessions were relatively thorough and could be passed, but what should be done in the future? The following are the questions raised by the employees of Feilong Rubber Factory and the guarantees made by Wei Changbin, the manager of the factory:
    "How do you plan to return the stolen money?" "I have drafted a plan to return the state assets I stole to the government. I will certainly abide by whatever the government decides to do with me; and I will try my best not to touch the factory's property."
    "How will you process orders in the future?" "I will never deceive the government or cut corners again. I am willing to make the cost calculation public. In the future, when signing contracts, I must do so openly and accept everyone's supervision."
    "What about the current unreasonable system?" "Yes, there are many unreasonable systems. I guarantee that I will discuss with the employees through the labor-management consultation meeting and gradually reform."
    Finally, with the consent of all employees, the review committee (or review小组) filled in the review opinion column of the "Five-Anti Conclusion Report Form" with words such as "The confession is relatively honest, passed," and signed and sealed it.
    The working class has a broad mind. At the end of each factory's review meeting, the employees repeatedly explained to the capitalists: Doing this is only to help you correct your mistakes. As long as you abide by the law in the future and become a legitimate industrialist and businessman, relying on all the employees and actively managing the business, the employees will definitely further unite with the capitalists, work hard to produce, and work together to build a new China.
    The capitalists of these factories were grateful for the education and lenient treatment given to them by the government and employees. They unanimously stated: In the future, they must obey the leadership of the working class, actively manage their businesses, and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes.

### 不老实坦白，就别想通过！——记天津飞龙橡胶厂等厂职工审查资方坦白材料

    不老实坦白，就别想通过！
    ——记天津飞龙橡胶厂等厂职工审查资方坦白材料
    天津市节约检查委员会目前正采用填写“‘五反’结论报告表”的方式处理坦白悔过的违法工商业者。每一个违法资本家在作结论的过程中，必须经过一个重要的步骤——老实坦白出自己的违法行为交职工审查通过。以下是天津日报记者报道的第十一区飞龙橡胶厂等厂职工在日前分别审查资方坦白材料的情形。
    各厂工人把车间或柜房临时清理出来，作为开会的处所，墙上贴着“只有坦白才有出路”“要服从工人阶级领导”等的标语。全体职工坐在一边，另一边是职工推选出来的审查委员会（或审查小组）——包括共产党、青年团、工会的干部，职员，老技术工人和女工。
    资本家进来了，开始坦白自己偷税漏税、行贿、盗窃国家资财的罪行。审查委员随时翻阅查对资方的坦白材料；每一个职工都仔细听着，不放过一句话。
    坦白以后，职工发现有和自己掌握的情况不符的，或有怀疑的地方，马上提出来，向资方提出质问。
    国光橡胶厂的职工曾提出质问：“给铁路局公安部做的一批绿跑鞋，为什么含胶量只有百分之四十呢？”
    万源橡胶厂的职工提出：“还有一笔税你没有谈呢！”
    对这些问题，资本家必须真实地交代。资本家把偷工减料的原因说成是“对成本计算不内行”，立即遭到了职工的驳斥。当天审查不完，职工宁肯第二天继续审查，决不马虎过去。工人说：既然犯了法，就应低头认罪，态度不老实，就别想被通过。
    各厂职工还在审查会上控诉了资方的罪行——他们向国家、向工人阶级猖狂进攻的罪行。 “刚解放的时候，厂里只有一个小锅炉、几个滚子；不多久就添了一个十四吋压胶机，一台刮布机，两个浆子锅，还盖了楼，盖了仓库……这些都是工人流血流汗，都是政府扶助的结果呀！ “可是，一九五零年遇到一点暂时的困难，你们就把钱藏起来，口口声声哭穷叫苦，张开两只手：一只手伸向政府，一只手伸向工人。政府照顾你们；工人自动减去一半工资，还把存在柜上的小米借给你们周转，总算对得起你们了吧！
     “但是，这样还不行。你们还要千方百计偷税漏税，偷工减料，盗窃国家资财。你们还有良心吗？”
    这是国光橡胶厂工人陈文起说的话。
    也有不少工人，由于长期地被压迫，被虐待，过去有苦不敢说，甚至不敢见资本家。经过这次运动，他们的觉悟提高了，产生了应有的勇气和气魄，敢于面对面地指斥资本家的罪行了。国光橡胶厂的女工王淑琴控诉说：“解放后女工有病不管治，歇一天工还要罚三天工资，有一次我剪海绵底把手剪破了，烂得生痛还得忍着干活。”
    许多高级职员和工人一起，也当场揭发了资本家的罪行和阴谋。过去，他们大多是被资方紧紧拉住，和工人之间有些隔膜的。在这次运动中，经过团结和教育，他们觉悟了，归队了。譬如飞龙橡胶厂跑外的周志超、万源橡胶厂会计李正元等，就都积极参加了检举工作。现在，在审查会上，工人和职员都当面向资方提出来：
    “把工人分成日工、里工、外工、件外临时工等多少等，是不是有意破坏工人的团结？”工人问。“改变药方不让我和工人说是什么意思？”技术人员问。
    “偷偷摸摸给我们加钱，这不是分化职工吗？”高级职员问。
    职工提出来的，每一件都是铁的事实。资本家无言答辩，只有连声说：“是，我承认”，“这是我的错误”。广大职工的揭发和指责，压下了不法资本家的嚣张的气焰，在真理面前他们低头了。
    审查结果，资方坦白比较彻底，可以通过了，但今后应该怎么办呢？下面是飞龙橡胶厂职工提出的问题和该厂经理魏昶斌的保证： “打算怎样退还赃款？” “我盗窃的国家资财，已拟定了一个退还给政府的办法，将来政府给我什么处理，一定遵照执行；我并且要尽量不动厂内的财产。”
    “以后加工定货怎么做呢？” “决不再蒙骗政府和偷工减料。我愿意把成本计算公开，今后订合同时一定要公开，接受大家的监督。”
    “目前的不合理制度呢？” “是，不合理的制度很多，我保证通过劳资协商会议，和职工共同研究，逐步改革。”
    最后，经全体职工同意，审查委员会（或审查小组）在“‘五反’结论报告表”的审查意见栏填上了类如“坦白比较老实，通过”等字样，并签名盖章。
    工人阶级的胸襟是宽大的。每一个工厂的职工，在审查会快结束时都向资方反复说明：这样做，只是为了帮助你们改正错误，只要你们今后奉公守法，作一个正当工商业者，依靠全体职工，积极经营，职工就一定更进一步团结资方，努力生产，共同为建设新中国而努力。
    这些工厂的资本家，感激政府和职工给予他们的教育和宽大处理。他们一致表示：今后一定要服从工人阶级的领导，积极经营，立功赎罪。    （新华社）
