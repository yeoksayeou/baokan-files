Heilongjiang Mutual Aid and Cooperation Model Village - Minji Village, Suihua County
Liu Xiaoguang

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government decided at the Fourth Provincial Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers and Peasants to award Minji Village, Ninth District, Suihua County, as a provincial mutual aid and cooperation model village.

(I)

Minji Village has a total of 181 households, with a cultivated area of 583 hectares. After the land reform in 1948, under the leadership of the Communist Party branch and the village people's government, the villagers implemented the policy of organization and mutual aid in labor and launched the first large-scale production campaign. The average yield per unit area was only 320 kilograms. There were only 132 draught animals. By 1951, the cultivated area had expanded to 616 hectares, and the yield per unit area had reached 830 kilograms, an increase of 150% compared to 1948. The village's draught animals increased to 194. Sideline production also greatly developed, and agricultural tools and houses also significantly increased. The lives of the masses improved, and the economic situation of 98% of the households in the village was better than during the land reform. Now, over 79% of the households in the village have reached the level of well-to-do middle peasants, while poor peasants and farm laborers account for less than 16%. More than half of the farmers in the village have surplus grain, and the purchasing power of the masses has increased. Currently, 60% of the male laborers in the village have two sets of cotton clothes, and more than 80% of the male and female laborers have shirts. The village has an average of two quilts for every three people.

How did Minji Village undergo such a significant change in four years? If you ask any farmer in Minji Village this question, they will happily answer you: Thanks to the good leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our village is organized, and everyone is becoming prosperous!

(II)

The main reason for the rapid development of production in Minji Village is the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement under the leadership of the Communist Party branch. All poor and middle peasants in the village participated in mutual aid teams, solving the difficulties in production for households without animals and also solving the problem of expanded reproduction for middle and well-to-do middle peasants. From then on, the peasant economy generally improved.

In the first year of the large-scale production campaign after the land reform in Minji Village, in addition to 131 horses and 13 carts, the village lacked other production tools, and some households were unable to cultivate the land on their own. At that time, the village cadres forcibly formed thirteen large mutual aid groups by assigning sections. These so-called large mutual aid groups were actually just "hook-up groups" of two to four households working together. They would join together for plowing and then disperse after planting. That year, most of the land in the village was only hoed once and plowed twice, without fertilizer application, and the average yield in the autumn was 320 kilograms per hectare. There was no record-keeping or work-exchange system in the mutual aid teams, and they often argued. The masses also had many complaints about the village cadres. When the village people's government was re-elected at the beginning of 1949, the Party branch examined the shortcomings in its work and further realized that leading the peasants to organize, assist each other in labor, and improve production was the only reliable way to make the masses move from poverty to prosperity. Therefore, the branch decided to strengthen its leadership over the labor mutual aid movement, calling on all Party members to take the lead in organizing a mutual aid team, adhering to the principle of voluntariness and implementing a mutually beneficial exchange of labor. Wang Ximing, the Party branch secretary, first promoted the Zhang Wennian mutual aid team, implementing a system of evaluating work points for people and animals and a work-ticket system. This group quickly improved its farming techniques, increased fertilizer application by 40%, and hoed and plowed three times. As a result, the yield per hectare was more than 100 kilograms higher than other groups.

(III)

They implemented a combination of agriculture and sideline production in production. The year-round mutual aid teams implemented a division of labor and specialization, organized surplus labor and surplus labor during slack seasons, directed it towards sideline production, developed year-round mutual aid, and increased farmers' income. In 1949, Minji Village established a supply and marketing cooperative, with each production team acting as a member representative team, with a supply and marketing team leader who submitted orders to the cooperative and plans for promoting products based on the team's agricultural and sideline production plan, combining production and supply and marketing. This not only enabled planned production but also promoted the development of the cooperative's supply and marketing business. In the same year, the Party branch also summarized the experiences and lessons of the past two years, grasped the general laws of mutual aid team development, put forward the slogan of consolidating mutual aid teams, changed the twenty-six teams into twenty-one, and helped three poor households, Sun Shan, Yu Jingbin, and Wang Yongqing, to join the mutual aid teams, organizing 100% of the farmers in the village. In the winter of 1949, a production increase plan for 1950 was drawn up, boosting the enthusiasm of the masses for production and leading sideline production such as carting, firewood collection, and manure accumulation, enriching the content of the mutual aid teams. Two more "three-major-season teams" were transformed into year-round mutual aid teams combining agriculture and sideline production, the number of seasonal teams increased to eleven, and the number of temporary teams decreased to six. In 1950, 32 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed in the village, and the amount of fertilizer and the number of hoeing and plowing operations were increased, and the yield per unit area increased to 730 kilograms, an increase of 280 kilograms compared to 1949. In the same year, the village added eleven large carts, thirty-two horses, and twenty-four head of cattle. Some sold weak livestock and bought strong livestock, and the lives of the masses became prosperous.

Minji Village implemented a combination of male and female labor, unified leadership, unified planning, and established a system of division of labor. The women's mutual aid teams in this village gradually improved with the development of the men's mutual aid teams. In 1948, there were sixteen temporary exchange labor mutual aid teams for women. By 1951, the mutual aid organization was gradually consolidated, becoming fifteen teams (including one year-round mutual aid team, six seasonal mutual aid teams, and eight temporary mutual aid teams). Women participating in mutual aid teams accounted for 86% of the village's female labor force. Due to the implementation of a male-female division of labor system within the mutual aid team, conditions were created for improving technology and increasing sideline income. For example, women in the Zhao Yongxi team participated in eleven types of light and heavy labor, such as picking weeds, spreading manure, hoeing and weeding, and applying topdressing fertilizer, which saved male labor and enabled more hoeing and plowing in the fields, with intensive and careful cultivation. The women's mutual aid teams especially formulated some necessary systems based on the physiological conditions of women. For example, the Wang Yuqin team formulated a system for rest during menstruation and before and after childbirth, and implemented a mutual aid system for taking care of children. Women in the mutual aid teams participated in learning like men, and democratic life was established within the team. Everyone's political awareness gradually increased, cultivating habits of mutual assistance and cooperation, which further consolidated the mutual aid teams.

(IV)

In the spring of 1951, under the leadership of the Zhang Wennian mutual aid team, all twenty mutual aid teams in the village participated in the patriotic production increase competition movement, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production increase reached an unprecedented high. The village set a production increase plan to achieve an average yield of 800 kilograms per hectare. After the popularization of patriotic education to resist US aggression and aid Korea before and after May 1st and the education in response to the "June 1st" call of the General Association to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the masses in the village realized that they must do a good job in the mutual aid teams to ensure the completion of the production increase plan to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Each household made concrete guarantees in the patriotic pacts to do a good job in the mutual aid teams and increase grain production. In the four production increase competition evaluations in the village, the work of improving mutual aid teams was inspected as the main item, and a movement to improve farming techniques was launched with the village technology committee and the mutual aid teams as the core. Fertilizer application reached 100% in the village, selected seeds were carefully chosen, and cultivation was meticulous, which had never happened before. In 1948, an average of 22.5 man-days and 15.5 horse-days were used per hectare. In 1951, an average of 48 man-days and 40 horse-days were used per hectare. Yields generally increased. The village averaged 830 kilograms of grain per hectare, exceeding the production increase plan by 30 kilograms. Zhang Wennian and other six mutual aid teams also created new records for high yields. However, there were differences in yields between different types of mutual aid teams. The large-scale, year-round mutual aid teams had higher yields than seasonal and temporary teams. For example, the Zhang Wennian-led year-round mutual aid team averaged 920 kilograms per hectare, while the Yu Jingfang team, which exchanged labor for the three major seasons, averaged 724 kilograms. During the patriotic production increase movement, the masses in this village saw more specifically the superiority of the more advanced mutual aid teams and demanded that the mutual aid teams continue to be improved. The Yu Jingfang team added four more households while engaging in sideline production and transformed from a seasonal mutual aid team into a year-round mutual aid team.

The year-round mutual aid teams have a relatively complete organizational structure and a detailed division of labor system. It has an agricultural team leader, a sideline team leader, a "leader," a substitute cultivation team leader, a supply and marketing team leader, a newspaper reading team leader, a credit team leader, and a technician, etc., each with specific responsibilities. The backbone of the team increased, and everyone had the opportunity to learn culture and politics. In addition to production mutual aid, mutual assistance was also implemented in supply and marketing, culture, politics, technical learning, and credit. Various organizations in the village are connected to the mutual aid teams. For example, the village technology committee can directly meet with the masses through technicians. The Party's propagandists also carry out propaganda according to the division of labor and contracting system for mutual aid teams. The mutual aid teams have become the most active organizations in the village. The patriotic production increase competition movement and the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Minji Village promoted each other and were closely integrated with the political movement, thus forming a high tide of the 1951 production increase competition and patriotic movement.

(V)

In December 1951, under the assistance of the work team led by Zhang Shiying, director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee Office, the Communist Party branch of this village clearly recognized the development direction of the rural economy. The branch led Party members, Youth League members, cadres, and activists in repeated deliberation and discussion, and formulated a five-year new rural construction plan for the entire village from 1952 to 1956. By 1956, it was required to increase the average yield per unit area to 1300 kilograms. It was required to eliminate households without horses in the village in 1953, use new Soviet-style animal-drawn farm implements, develop animal husbandry, build brick kilns to build a new countryside... In supporting poor peasants in developing production, it was decided to establish a credit department in the supply and marketing cooperative to develop and consolidate the credit business between mutual aid teams and to organize and use the surplus funds within the teams reasonably. Now, the mutual aid teams in the village have been rectified, and it has been decided to establish an agricultural production cooperative based on the Zhang Wennian mutual aid team. Now the masses in the village are preparing to realize the first year of the new rural construction plan.

    黑龙江互助合作模范村——绥化县民吉村
    刘晓光
    中共黑龙江省委员会和黑龙江省人民政府，在全省第四届工农劳动模范代表大会上，决定评奖绥化县第九区民吉村为全省互助合作模范村。
    （一）
    民吉村共有一百八十一户，耕地面积五百八十三垧。一九四八年土地改革后，全村农民在共产党支部和村人民政府领导下，贯彻了组织起来、劳动互助的方针，开展了第一次大生产运动。单位面积产量平均只有三石二斗，耕畜只有一百三十二头；到一九五一年，耕地面积扩大到六百一十六垧，单位面积产量达到八石三斗，比一九四八年提高了一倍半；全村耕畜增加到一百九十四头；副业生产也有很大发展，农具、房屋也显著地增加了。群众生活改善了，全村百分之九十八的户数的经济状况比土地改革时上升了。现在全村已有百分之七十九强的户数，提高到中农生活的水平，贫农和雇农只占百分之十六弱。村中一半以上农户有了余粮，群众购买力提高了。现在全村百分之六十的男劳动者已有两套棉衣，百分之八十以上的男女劳动者都有了衬衣，全村平均每三人有两床被子。
    民吉村四年来怎么会有这么大的变化呢？这一问题，你随便问民吉村那一个农民，他便会很愉快地回答你：毛主席共产党领导的好，我们村里组织起来，大家就富裕了！
    （二）
    民吉村生产迅速发展的主要原因，是在共产党支部领导下，开展了互助合作运动。全村贫农和中农全部参加了互助组，解决了没马户生产中的困难问题，也解决了中农和富裕中农的扩大再生产的问题。从此，农民经济普遍上升。
    民吉村在土地改革后第一年大生产运动中，全村除了一百三十一匹马、十三辆车以外，其他生产工具很不齐全，有些户无力单独种地。当时村干部曾强迫分段编起了十三个互助大组。所谓互助大组，实际上只是两户到四户插犋的“挂勾组”，扣地时候联起来，种完地就散了。这一年，这个村大部分土地只铲一遍、趟两犁，没有上粪，到秋天每垧平均打了三石二斗粮。互助组在变工中没有记账还工制度，常常争吵。群众对村干部也有不少意见。一九四九年初改选村人民政府时，党支部检查了工作上的缺点，进一步认识到领导农民组织起来，劳动互助，搞好生产，是使群众由穷变富的唯一可靠的办法。于是支部便决定加强对劳动互助运动的领导，号召全体党员每人带头组织起一个互助组来，坚持自愿原则，实行两利的换工办法。党支部书记王喜明首先推动张文年互助组，实行了人马评功和工票制度。这个组很快提高了耕作技术，施肥增加了百分之四十，铲趟达到三遍。结果，每垧地比其他组多打一石多。
    （三）
    他们在生产中实行了农副业结合。常年互助组实行了分工分业、组织剩余劳动力以及农闲时的剩余劳动力，投向副业生产，发展了常年互助，增加了农民收入。一九四九年民吉村成立了供销合作社，以每一生产小组为一社员代表小组，有供销组长，按照组里农副业生产计划向合作社提出定货和推销产品的计划，生产和供销结合起来。这样，不仅能有计划地进行生产，同时也促进了合作社供销业务的发展。这一年，党支部还总结了两年来的经验教训，掌握了互助组发展的一般规律，提出整顿互助组的口号，把二十六个组改变为二十一个组，并帮助孙山、于景滨、王永清等三个贫困户参加到互助组里去，全村农户百分之百组织起来了。在一九四九年冬季，就订出了一九五零年的增产计划，鼓起群众生产热情，有领导地搞起拉脚、打柴、积粪等副业生产，充实了互助组的内容。又有两个“三大季组”改变为农副业结合的常年互助组，季节组多到十一个，临时组减少到六个了。一九五零年，全村开了三十二垧荒地，施肥量和铲趟遍数都增加了，单位面积产量提高到七石三斗，比一九四九年增加了两石八斗。这一年全村添了十一辆大车、三十二匹马、二十四条牛，有的把软弱的牲口卖掉，买进了壮实的牲口，群众生活富裕起来了。
    民吉村实行了男女劳动力结合，统一领导、统一计划，并建立了分工分活的制度。这个村的妇女互助组是随着男子互助组的发展而逐年提高的。一九四八年有十六个妇女临时换工互助组；到一九五
    一年互助组织逐渐巩固，变成十五个组（其中常年互助组一个，季节互助组六个，临时互助组八个）。参加互助组的妇女占全村妇女劳动力的百分之八十六。由于互助组内实行男女分工分活制度，创造了提高技术、增加副业收入的条件。如赵永喜组妇女参加了拣槎子、扬粪、铲耨地、施追肥等十一种轻重劳动，节省了男劳动力，使地里活作到多铲多趟，精耕细作。妇女互助组特别根据妇女的生理条件，制订了一些必要的制度。如王玉琴组制订了月经期和产前产后休息的制度，并实行了互助带孩子的办法。在互助组的妇女和男子一样参加学习，组内建立了民主生活，大家政治觉悟逐渐提高了，养成了互助合作的习惯，更加巩固了互助组。
    （四）
    一九五一年春，在张文年互助组带头号召下，全村二十个互助组都参加了爱国丰产竞赛运动，群众增产热情空前增高，全村订出了平均每垧地打粮八石的丰产计划。经过“五一”前后普及抗美援朝爱国主义教育和响应抗美援朝总会“六一”号召的教育，全村群众认识了必须搞好互助组，保证完成丰产计划，来支援中国人民志愿军。各户在爱国公约里都订出了搞好互助组和增产粮食的具体保证。全村四次丰产竞赛评比中，把搞好互助组工作作为主要项目进行检查，并以村技术委员会和互助组为核心，展开改进耕作技术的运动。全村施肥达到百分之百，精选种籽，耕作细致，是过去从没有过的。一九四八年，每垧地平均用二十二个半人工，十五个半马工；一九五一年平均每垧地用四十八个人工，四十个马工。产量普遍提高了。全村平均每垧地产粮八石三斗，超过丰产计划三斗。张文年等六个互助组，还创造了高额产量新纪录。但是，在不同类型的互助组之间，产量是不同的，大型的常年互助组比季节组和临时组产量都高。如张文年领导的常年互助组，每垧平均产量是九石二斗；三大季换工的于景芳组平均每垧打七石二斗四升。在爱国丰产运动中，这个村的群众更具体地看到较高级的互助组的优越性，都要求把互助组继续提高。于景芳组在搞副业当中，又增加了四户，而且变季节互助组为常年互助组了。
    常年互助组内，有一套比较完整的组织机构和细密的分工制度：它有农业组长、副业组长、“打头的”、代耕组长、供销组长、读报组长、信贷组长和技术员等等，各负专责。组内骨干增加了，大家都有机会学习文化和政治，而且在生产互助之外，供销、文化、政治、技术学习和信贷等等方面，也都实行互助。村里的各种组织，都和互助组发生联系，如村技术委员会可以通过技术员直接和群众见面；党的宣传员也按互助组实行分工包干制进行宣传，互助组已成为村里最活跃的组织了。民吉村的爱国丰产竞赛运动和互助合作运动相互推动，并紧密地结合了政治运动，因此形成了一九五一年丰产竞赛与爱国运动的高潮。
    （五）
    一九五一年十二月，这个村的共产党支部在黑龙江省委办公室主任张士英领导的工作组的帮助下，明确地认识了农村经济的发展方向。支部领导党员、团员、干部和积极分子反复酝酿、讨论，订出了全村从一九五二年到一九五六年的五年新农村建设计划。到一九五六年，要求平均单位面积产量提高到十三石。要求在一九五三年全村消灭无马户，全部使用苏联新式马拉农具，发展牧畜业，修砖窑建设新农村……。在扶助贫农发展生产上，决定在供销合作社里成立信贷部，发展巩固和互助组之间的信贷事业，合理地组织、使用组内剩余资金。现在，全村互助组已经进行了整顿，决定以张文年互助组为基础，成立一个农业生产合作社。现在全村群众正为实现第一年新农村建设计划作准备工作。
