The public security personnel in Huanggu District, Shenyang, Lost Their Stance and Actually Supported Unscrupulous Merchants, Unreasonably Detaining Workers
To the Editor: Unscrupulous merchants in Huanggu District, Shenyang, are using certain corrupt public security personnel to persecute workers. Zhang Yunxiu, an unscrupulous merchant running the Fuxing Iron Furnace Shop in the district, had previously signed a guarantee to repay the wages he had unjustly deducted from the workers. In order to evade his debt, he sent his henchmen to the Xuechi Street Police Station to make a false report, claiming that worker Zhang Fengxuan had injured his accomplice, Ma Fengjiang. Wu Qingyun, the household registration officer at the police station, was in collusion with the unscrupulous merchant and also resented the fact that the workers had recently reported him. He immediately led the police to the shop and arrested Zhang Fengxuan and three other workers. Upon hearing the news, the heads of the district's Handicraft Workers' Union and the factory's union went to the police station to explain the truth of the matter. Jing Yuantong, the director of the police station, without inquiring into the facts, detained all the people who came, and even ordered Zhang Fengxuan to confess his guilt to Ma Fengjiang. When Zhang Fengxuan refused, Jing scolded him, saying:
	"What's so great about you workers? This is a public security organ, not a place for you to speak!" Jing then ordered the district's Joint Hospital to issue a diagnosis certificate and sent the arrested workers and union cadres to Bureau Chief Zhu of the District Public Security Sub-bureau for strict handling. The District Thriftiness Inspection Committee raised objections, and the workers in the district also filed complaints with higher authorities. Bureau Chief Zhu then ordered the release of those arrested, but these people had already been detained for ten hours. Afterwards, Bureau Chief Zhu treated the matter with an extremely unserious attitude and has not dealt with it to this day. This behavior has created a very bad influence among the masses, and the relevant leading departments should investigate and deal with it.

    沈阳市皇姑区公安人员失掉立场
    竟替奸商撑腰无理扣押工人
    编辑同志：沈阳市皇姑区奸商利用某些腐化的公安人员迫害工人。该区复兴铁炉铺奸商张云修曾具结偿还被他无故克扣的工人的工资。他为了赖债，就派爪牙到雪耻街派出所作假报告，说工人张凤选打伤了他的同伙马封疆。派出所户籍员吴庆云和奸商有勾结，又恨工人最近检举了他，即率警察到该铺逮捕了张凤选等四个工人。区手工业工会、该厂工会等负责人闻讯，即到派出所说明此事真相。派出所所长荆元通不问情由，即将来人一并扣押，还叫张凤选向马封疆认罪。张凤选不答应，荆就骂他说：
    “你们这些工人有什么了不起，这里是公安机关，不是你们说话的地方！”荆接着命令区联合医院开诊断书，把被捕的工人与工会干部送交区公安分局朱局长严办。区节约检查委员会提出意见，该区工人又纷纷向上级控诉，朱局长才下令释放被捕者，但这些人已被扣押十小时了。事后，朱局长以极不严肃的态度对待此事，迄今没有处理。这种行为在群众中造成很不好的影响，有关领导部门应予以检查处理。　虞唐
