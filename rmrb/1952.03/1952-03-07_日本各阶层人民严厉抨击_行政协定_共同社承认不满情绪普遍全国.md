Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: The Japanese bourgeois news agency Kyodo News Agency published an article by its political affairs vice-director, Tsuyoshi Hidefu, on the 4th. This article admitted that the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," recently signed by the traitorous Yoshida government of Japan and its American masters to enslave Japan, has been strongly opposed by the Japanese people. Tsuyoshi Hidefu said: "The reaction to the Administrative Agreement" "within (Japan) has been unexpectedly bad." He pointed out: "The attitude taken by the majority of the people towards the Administrative Agreement shows a very high level of criticism compared with their attitude when the peace treaty and security treaty were signed in the past." Even some intellectuals who are "extremely indifferent to politics" "feel strong dissatisfaction and unease about this agreement." Tsuyoshi Hidefu also said that in the Diet, the opposition parties will link the "Administrative Agreement" issue with the deliberation of the Yoshida government's draft budget, "launching fierce attacks on the government" and "issuing sharp criticisms."

Tsuyoshi Hidefu admitted that the severe criticism of the "Administrative Agreement" by the Japanese people of all classes is "a matter of course." He said: because, "it is not difficult to predict" that "the consequences of this agreement will directly become a painful burden on the lives of the people." Providing military bases, materials, labor, and maintenance fees for the US military, extraterritorial rights, and regulations regarding so-called "emergency situations" "all have a great impact on the lives of the people." Moreover, in the draft budget, a very large percentage is occupied by rearmament and "items directly related to the Administrative Agreement," while the Yoshida government not only did not submit the "Administrative Agreement" to the Diet for discussion in advance, but even "stubbornly delayed the date of the agreement's publication until after the House of Representatives passed the draft budget." Tsuyoshi Hidefu said that all of this makes people "clearly feel" that the Yoshida government's signing of the "Administrative Agreement" "is not an open and aboveboard act," and this act "cannot be said to be a democratic method."

Tsuyoshi Hidefu also had to admit that although the "Administrative Agreement" has been announced, many major issues related to the vital interests of the Japanese people are still being kept secret. For example, "the issue of providing facilities (i.e., military bases), which is most closely related to the lives of the people," and "the issue of emergency situations, which is directly related to the fate of the country," etc. "the most important issues in the agreement," the specific provisions of which have still not been made public. Tsuyoshi Hidefu finally said: "Judging from the government's consistent approach, the general public cannot but feel a deep sense of unease about the outcome of the Administrative Agreement."

    日本各阶层人民严厉抨击“行政协定”
    共同社承认不满情绪普遍全国
    【新华社六日讯】日本资产阶级通讯社共同社四日发表了该社政务次长津吉秀夫的一篇文章，这篇文章承认：日本吉田卖国政府和它的美国主人最近签订的奴役日本的美日“行政协定”，已遭到日本人民的强烈反对。津吉秀夫说：“行政协定”“在（日本）国内的反应是出乎意料的坏”。他指出：“大多数国民对行政协定所采取的态度和从前在和约与安全条约签字时的态度相比较，表现出很高的批评力。”甚至若干“对政治极为冷淡”的知识分子“对这个协定也都感到强烈的不满和不安”。津吉秀夫又说：在国会中，各在野党派将“行政协定”问题联系着对吉田政府预算草案的审议，“向政府猛烈攻击”，“发出了尖锐的批评”。
    津吉秀夫承认：日本各阶层人民对“行政协定”的严厉抨击是“理所当然的事”。他说：因为，“不难预料”，“这个协定的后果将直接成为国民生活中痛苦的重担”。向美国驻军提供军事基地、物资、劳务和维持费，治外法权以及关于所谓“紧急状态”的规定等，“都对国民生活有极大的影响”。而且，在预算草案中有关重新武装和“与行政协定有直接关系的款项”占着极大的百分比，而吉田政府不但不先将“行政协定”提交国会讨论，竟然“蛮横地把协定的发表日期拖延到众议院通过预算草案之后”。津吉秀夫说：这一切都使人“清楚地感觉到”：吉田政府签订“行政协定”“不是光明磊落的作为”，这种作为“决不能说是民主的办法”。
    津吉秀夫也不得不承认：尽管“行政协定”业已公布，但是许多有关日本人民切身利害的重大问题尚被保持在秘密中。例如，“对国民生活关系最深切的提供设施（按即军事基地）问题”、“和国家命运有直接关系的紧急状态”问题等“协定中最重要的问题”，其中的具体规定仍然没有被公布出来。津吉秀夫最后说：“从政府的一贯的这种作风看来，一般国民对行政协定的结果不能没有痛切的不安之感。”
