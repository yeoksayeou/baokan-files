Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 21st (TASS dispatch): Soviet representative Malik delivered the following statement at the United Nations Disarmament Commission meeting on March 19:

    The United Nations Disarmament Commission established by the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly has begun its actual work.

    Regarding the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament, there were two opposing attitudes at the last United Nations General Assembly: one was the Soviet attitude, and the other was the attitude of the United States, Britain, and France.

    The Soviet Union then suggested that the United Nations General Assembly should consider the use of atomic weapons—instruments of aggression and mass slaughter of people—as a violation of the honor and conscience of nations and incompatible with membership in the United Nations. Therefore, it should declare an unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and establish strict international control to implement this prohibition. At the same time, the Soviet Union believed that the prohibition of atomic weapons and the implementation of international supervision should be carried out simultaneously.

    The Soviet Union then suggested that the Disarmament Commission should begin drafting a convention that stipulates all necessary measures to ensure the fulfillment of the resolutions on prohibiting atomic weapons, ceasing their production, completely using the already-made atomic bombs for civilian purposes, and establishing strict international supervision for the implementation of the above convention. The Soviet Union then suggested that such a draft convention should be drafted before June 1, 1952, and submitted to the Security Council for consideration.

    The Soviet Union then suggested that the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, China, and France reduce their armaments and armed forces by one-third within a year.

    The Soviet Union then suggested that, in any case, no later than one month after the United Nations General Assembly passed the resolution on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament of armaments and armed forces, all countries must submit complete official materials reporting the status of their armaments and armed forces, including atomic weapons and military bases on foreign territories.

    The Soviet proposals stipulated the establishment of an international control body within the Security Council to supervise the implementation of the resolutions on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament of armaments and armed forces and to review the reports submitted by countries on their armaments. To establish an appropriate guarantee system to ensure compliance with the resolutions on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament, the Soviet Union suggested that the international control body should have the right to conduct regular inspections without the right to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries.

    Finally, the Soviet Union then suggested that a world conference should be convened no later than July 15, 1952, inviting member states of the United Nations and countries that are not yet members to jointly discuss the issue of large-scale disarmament of armaments and armed forces, and to discuss practical measures for prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing international supervision for the implementation of such a prohibition.

    However, these Soviet proposals, like before, were resisted and opposed by the United States, Britain, and France. They put forward their joint proposal, the purpose of which was essentially to avoid the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament, and to replace it with a suggestion of collecting military intelligence.

    The amendments and suggestions made by the Soviet delegation to this proposal were opposed by the three countries. In order to justify their opposition, they insisted that the Soviet proposals did not stipulate the simultaneous implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons and international supervision. Furthermore, they insisted that the Soviet proposals did not stipulate regular inspections of the implementation of the resolutions on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament. But when the Soviet Union explained its attitude on these issues and put forward specific suggestions, advocating the simultaneous implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons and international supervision, and in order to establish an appropriate guarantee system to ensure that the General Assembly's resolution on the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament was complied with, the international supervision body had the right to conduct regular inspections without the right to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, the United States, Britain, and France not only refused to accept these Soviet suggestions at this time, but even disagreed to discuss them at the General Assembly meeting.

    The United States' voting machine in the United Nations, as in the past, was activated at the Sixth General Assembly, forcing the General Assembly to accept a resolution that prevented the United Nations from trying to solve the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament.

    It is very necessary to review all these situations when this Disarmament Commission has just started its work.

    There are two proposals submitted to the Disarmament Commission for consideration: one contains the Soviet suggestions, and the other contains the suggestions of the three countries.

    Therefore, the Disarmament Commission is faced with this question: What should it discuss? How should it start its work?

    Should it follow the path that the US delegation is trying to force it to accept, wasting its breath discussing the issue of collecting military intelligence, regardless of how to solve the issue of disarmament and prohibiting atomic weapons? Or should it immediately and without delay begin work that is truly beneficial to the cause of peace, and immediately begin to study the prohibition of atomic weapons, disarmament, and the submission of complete official reports by countries on their armaments?

    Whether this work can be successful, whether it is useful to establish this committee, and whether it is worthwhile will mainly depend on what the committee is going to discuss and how it starts its work.

    The US representative has presented his committee's work plan. In this plan, the whole thing is just about collecting military intelligence. The US representative said when presenting this suggestion that the wording of this plan is consistent with the proposals previously submitted by the United States, Britain, and France at the United Nations General Assembly. However, in this "wording," we only hear very clearly and explicitly about collecting military intelligence. The issue of disarmament and prohibiting atomic weapons is not mentioned at all. He shelved this issue and replaced it with the ghost story of collecting military intelligence.

    The Soviet representatives have asked the US representatives whether they are willing to support the suggestions of disarmament and prohibiting weapons of mass destruction, because if such a resolution is passed, it is possible to immediately obtain complete military intelligence from all countries. In response, the US representative openly said that his Disarmament Commission's work plan has nothing to do with this issue, that is, the issue of disarmament and prohibiting atomic weapons. Therefore, according to this plan, the work of the committee cannot produce positive results that can solve this important issue. There is nothing new in this US attitude.

    The United States has consistently harbored a goal—to obtain intelligence on the armaments and armed forces of other countries, but to keep its atomic weapons intelligence secret, while in any case preventing the Soviet suggestions on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament of armaments and armed forces from being adopted.

    Now, the United States is once again, for perhaps the nth time, suggesting collecting military intelligence in the name of reporting and inspecting armaments and armed forces, once again attempting to hide the urgent need to prohibit atomic weapons and disarmament and to stop the expansion of the arms race, and to divert the world's attention from this urgent need.

    US newspapers openly said in their comments on the US attitude: The US government wants to turn this entire issue into a universal reporting of armaments and armed forces by all countries in the world, instead of disarmament and prohibiting atomic weapons.

    We believe that it is necessary to clarify here what attitude each side has taken in the past and is taking now on the issue of disarmament and prohibiting atomic weapons. The best way to do this is to talk about specific facts and figures. Let's talk about this now.

    The US government always says that the Soviet Union has a large army, trying in vain to use this as an excuse to justify the expansion of the arms race (especially the massive growth of US armaments). We believe that the reason why the United States is expanding its armaments and forcing other countries to engage in the arms race is precisely because the ruling groups in the United States are implementing an expansion of the arms race and aggressive policies, which allows the monopoly capitalists who rule the United States to obtain great profits.

    The US ruling groups have chosen the path of aggression, expansion of armaments, and launching a new world war. Let me cite some facts. The profits of US monopoly capital, before taxes, averaged $5.3 billion per year from 1936 to 1939; during the war years from 1942 to 1945, the average annual profit increased to $22.7 billion, which is four times that of peacetime. In 1951, at the height of the expansion of the arms race and the war of aggression against Korea, the profits of US monopoly capital grew to an unprecedented record in US history—$44.8 billion, almost twice the average profit during World War II and more than eight times the profit in peacetime.

    Along with the unprecedented profits gained by monopoly capital, the situation of the people is getting worse and worse, inflation is intensifying, the cost of living is rising, and taxes are greatly increasing. According to materials published in the Congressional Record, the total amount of various taxes in the United States is currently 63.3 percent higher than the total taxes in the years of World War II.

    Taxes devour one-third of the people's income. The situation is even more bitter in Western European countries. Under the demands of the US ruling groups, these countries are all engaging in an expansion of the arms race, preparing for another world war. In these countries, on average, 47 to 60 percent of the people's annual income has to be paid in taxes. These figures were published by US newspapers not many days ago. They pointed out: The heavy tax burden in Western European countries is beyond all imagination.

    This is how this small group of billionaires and millionaires have amassed their wealth on the suffering of the masses of the people. DuPont, one of the representatives of US big business, admitted in a recent public speech that at present, that is, at the moment of the frenzied arms race and the Korean War, the situation is the same as in the previous two world wars, with the vast majority of war orders going to the big monopoly capitalists, and therefore the profits generated from them also falling into their pockets. President Truman also largely confirmed this in his latest State of the Union address to Congress on January 16, 1952. Truman reported that in 1951 alone, military appropriations for basic types of war spending reached $45 billion, and the profits of US monopoly capital before taxes were $44.8 billion, the highest in US history.

    It was in these years that the United States refused to prohibit atomic weapons and increased the production and storage of atomic weapons at a frenzied pace.

    After World War II, the US atomic expansion of the arms race has not stopped for a single day. Now, this has become a multi-billion dollar business, earning huge profits for US monopoly capital. In the US fiscal year of 1945, the amount used for the production of atomic weapons was 418 million US dollars; this expenditure doubled in the fiscal year of 1950, reaching 897 million US dollars. In 1951, this expenditure doubled again, reaching 1.7 billion US dollars. In the next two years, this expenditure will continue to grow, and is expected to increase to more than 3 billion US dollars per year. This is the truth about the US government's "peaceful" policy and the "demobilization" of the US armed forces after the war.

    The United States not only completely retained its network of military bases surrounding the Soviet Union in foreign territories after World War II, but also began to expand this network from the very day the war ended.

    During this period, US representatives in the United Nations kept talking about disarmament, attempting to replace disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons with the collection of military intelligence. However, at the same time, the US ruling groups were carrying out a frenzied expansion of the arms race, increasing their armed forces, expanding military bases, and organizing new military aggression alliances. According to incomplete official materials, since 1947, when the United Nations began discussing disarmament, the strength of the US armed forces has increased by more than 2.3 times. According to the statement of the US representative to the Disarmament Commission, the total number of US armed forces today has reached 3.5 million. They also plan to increase it by another 220,000 in 1952, not including the increase in military reserves and the National Guard.

    If we compare the military expenditures of the United States in recent years with the military expenditures during the war, we can see that long before the United States began its aggression against Korea, the direct military expenditures in the fiscal year of 1949 had already almost reached three times the military expenditures in the first year of World War II, equivalent to 17 times the military expenditures in the pre-war year of 1940. The military appropriations in the fiscal year of 1951 exceeded the military appropriations in 1942, the year of the war. The total amount of war appropriations earmarked for the upcoming fiscal year of 1952 exceeded all direct military expenditures in 1943.

    At the Sixth United Nations General Assembly in 1951, the United States stubbornly refused to disarm and also refused to prohibit atomic weapons. The United States is still doing the same in 1952, as can be seen from the plan submitted by the United States to the Disarmament Commission.

    This committee is called the Disarmament Commission, but the US plan not only does not conform to this name at all, nor does it conform to the task of disarming, nor even does it conform to the disarmament work that the committee must handle.

    The committee's work plan proposed by the US delegation is to turn this committee into a committee to discuss the issue of collecting military intelligence, thus replacing the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament, which is of great importance to the cause of peace and international security.

    This plan may conform to the interests of the US intelligence agencies because it can use the committee to obtain intelligence; but this plan does not conform at all to the work of prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament that the committee must handle.

    It is certainly necessary to submit complete military intelligence to the committee at the appropriate time—when the resolutions on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament have been passed. There is no doubt that at that time, all countries will consider it a matter of course to submit the necessary intelligence to the committee; and at that time, of course, no one will refuse to submit such intelligence.

    In view of the above, the committee must first begin by passing a resolution on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament, instead of engaging in fruitless discussions on the issue of providing military intelligence. This should be very obvious.

    It can be seen from the US plan that the drafters of the plan are determined to have the committee engage in fruitless discussions on the issue of collecting military intelligence, to avoid discussing the issue of disarmament after delaying the discussion on the issue of reporting and reviewing intelligence, although the name of this committee is the Disarmament Commission. In fact, the US representative is suggesting that the committee abandon solving the issues of disarmament, prohibiting atomic weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

    The US plan does not mention disarmament; "Item III" of this plan reduces the whole thing to formulating national plans agreed upon by all parties, and these plans are agreed upon after countries hold negotiations on the issue of the military and armaments that each country is allowed to possess. This item does not even mention the necessity of disarmament—all of this is not accidental. It is very obvious that the US plan is for countries to hold negotiations behind the committee's back to increase armaments instead of reducing armaments.

    I cannot but point out that the ensuing situation is to replace the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament with the issue of providing military intelligence. I also cannot but point out that, as I have already pointed out, the US draft reduces this matter to agreements between governments on their military plans, not to disarm, but to force countries to intensify the arms race. And all of this will be carried out under the banner of the Disarmament Commission, in endless talk about the "reporting and inspection" of military "intelligence."

    But this would mean that the committee would be openly deceiving public opinion. Because the committee cannot start deceiving public opinion, it cannot accept the US plan as the work plan of the Disarmament Commission.

    What is of decisive importance in the entire issue of disarmament and prohibiting atomic weapons is the adoption of a principled resolution on disarmament and prohibiting weapons of mass destruction (including atomic weapons). Adopting such a resolution is very important for consolidating peace. As for the issue of countries providing military intelligence, by adopting a resolution on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament, it is immediately possible to obtain complete intelligence on the armaments of all countries. This will ensure that complete intelligence on the strength of the armed forces and armaments of all countries can be obtained.

    The Soviet delegation believes that since this committee is named the Disarmament Commission, it should first discuss and adopt a resolution on prohibiting atomic weapons and carrying out disarmament, mainly starting with the five major powers, at the beginning of its work. Therefore, the Soviet delegation, under the instructions of the Soviet government, proposes the following work plan for the United Nations Disarmament Commission:

    (I) Prohibiting atomic weapons, disarmament, and reporting military intelligence.

    (1) Adopt a resolution on unconditionally prohibiting atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. Establish strict international supervision for the implementation of this prohibition, and the prohibition of atomic weapons and international supervision should be carried out simultaneously.

    (2) Adopt a resolution on disarmament and armed forces:

    (a) Formulate a plan agreed upon by all parties, suggesting that the five major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, the People's Republic of China, Britain, and France—reduce their respective existing armaments and armed forces by one-third within a year.

    (b) Adopt a resolution to convene a world conference to discuss the issue of large-scale disarmament of armaments and armed forces, and to discuss practical measures for prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing strict international supervision for the implementation of this prohibition.

    (3) Adopt a resolution stipulating that after the resolution on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament is passed, the governments of all countries must immediately submit complete official intelligence on the status of their armaments and armed forces, including atomic weapons and military bases in foreign territories.

    (II) Study the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare, the impermissibility of using bacteriological weapons, and the punishment of those who violate the ban on bacteriological warfare.

    (III) Draft a convention to be submitted to the Security Council for consideration, which stipulates various measures to ensure:

    (1) Prohibiting atomic weapons and stopping their production;

    (2) Existing atomic bombs are only used for civilian purposes;

    (3) Establishing strict international supervision for the implementation of the convention on prohibiting atomic weapons.

    (IV) Formulate a provision to establish an international supervision body within the Security Council, whose functions are:

    (1) To supervise the implementation of the resolution on prohibiting atomic weapons;

    (2) To supervise the implementation of the resolution on disarmament and armed forces;

    (3) To review the intelligence submitted by the governments of various countries on the status of their armaments and armed forces.

    (V) In order to establish an appropriate guarantee system to ensure compliance with the resolutions on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament, the international control agency should have the right to conduct regular inspections without the right to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries.

    The plan we have put forward stipulates the study of the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass slaughter of people, and at the same time the establishment of strict international supervision over the implementation of this prohibition, with a view to the simultaneous implementation of the prohibition of atomic weapons and international supervision.

    Our plan also stipulates that the Disarmament Commission must immediately begin to study the issue of disarmament.

    An effective work plan for the Disarmament Commission must provide for the formulation of a plan that recommends the immediate adoption of a principled resolution on prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing international supervision over the implementation of this prohibition, over disarmament and armed forces.

    The work plan for the Disarmament Commission proposed by the Soviet Union also stipulates that the governments of various countries submit complete official intelligence on the status of armaments (including atomic weapons), which must be submitted immediately after the resolution on prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament is passed.

    The plan we have put forward also stipulates the study of the issue of violating the ban on bacteriological warfare, the impermissibility of using bacteriological weapons, and the punishment of those who violate the ban on bacteriological warfare. The urgency of this issue can be clearly seen from the fact that today, the US military is already using bacteriological weapons on a large scale, thus viciously violating the international agreement on prohibiting the shameful and inhumane war—bacteriological warfare. This kind of war is intolerable to the conscience of upright people and the conscience of all civilized nations. The committee cannot ignore this issue.

    This issue must be brought to the attention of the committee even more, since the military that is using bacteriological weapons today is the military of a country whose government has refused to ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use of asphyxiating gases and other similar poisonous gases and bacteriological weapons in wartime. At the Geneva Conference in July 1949, when drafting the international conventions for the protection of war victims, the US government opposed the prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction of people.

    At that conference, the US delegation refused to accept the suggestion put forward by the Soviet delegation, which at that time suggested passing a statement saying: "The use of bacteriological and chemical weapons, atomic or other weapons for the purpose of mass slaughter of people is a violation of the basic principles of international law."

    Recently, some US generals, such as Rooks, Clissey, and Bull, have confirmed in their conversations that the United States has been intensively preparing for bacteriological warfare for a long time. I cannot but remind everyone of the fact that US Secretary of State Acheson, although attempting to clumsily deny that the US military has used bacteriological weapons, did not want to express his opposition to the use of such weapons, nor did he denounce this evil means of warfare.

    The United Nations Disarmament Commission must study this issue. The committee must condemn those who violate the convention prohibiting bacteriological weapons in order to prevent the use of such weapons and punish those who violate the above-mentioned convention prohibiting bacteriological weapons.

    If the committee adopts the work plan proposed by the Soviet delegation, studies the suggestions contained in this plan, and formulates specific plans based on these suggestions, it will help to accelerate the solution of the problems of prohibiting atomic weapons and disarmament, which should have been solved long ago. However, the US-British bloc in the United Nations, primarily the stubborn resistance of the United States, is still hindering the solution of these problems to this day.

    苏联代表马立克三月十九日在联合国裁减军备委员会会议上的声明全文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：苏联代表马立克三月十九日在联合国裁减军备委员会会议上发表声明如下：
    由联合国大会第六届会议设立的联合国裁减军备委员会开始进行实际工作了。
    关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备的问题，上次的联合国大会上有两种相反的态度：一方面是苏联的态度，另一方面是美、英、法三国的态度。
    苏联当时建议，联合国大会应该认为使用侵略和大规模屠杀人民的工具——原子武器是违反国家的荣誉和良知的，而且是和联合国会员国资格不相容的，因此应该宣布无条件禁止原子武器，为执行这项禁令而建立严格的国际监督。同时，苏联认为，禁止原子武器和实施国际监督，两者应该同时实行。
    苏联当时建议，裁减军备委员会应该着手拟订一个公约草案，规定各种必要的措施，以保证关于禁止原子武器、停止其生产、将已经制成的原子弹完全用于民用目的以及就上述公约的履行建立严格的国际监督这几方面的决议，得以履行。苏联当时建议，这样的公约草案应该在一九五二年六月一日之前拟订好，提交安全理事会考虑。
    苏联当时建议，苏联、美国、英国、中国和法国在一年期间内把它们的军备和武装部队裁减三分之
    一。
    苏联当时建议，无论如何最迟不得超过联合国大会通过了禁止原子武器和裁减军备与武装部队的决议之后一个月内，一切国家必须提出完整的官方材料，报告它们的军备和武装部队的情况，包括原子武器及在外国领土上的军事基地的情况。
    苏联的建议规定，在安全理事会之内建立一个国际监督机构，负责监督关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备及武装部队的决议的执行，并审查各国就它们的军备情况提出的报告。为了建立适当的保证制度，以使关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备的决议得到遵守，苏联建议国际监督机构，在没有权利干涉各国内政的条件下，有权进行经常的视察。
    最后，苏联当时建议，最迟在一九五二年七月十五日之前召开一次世界会议，请联合国各会员国以及目前还不是会员国的国家参加，共同研讨大量裁减军备和武装部队的问题，并研讨禁止原子武器以及为这种禁令的执行建立国际监督的实际办法。
    然而，苏联这些建议也是像以前一样，受到美、英、法三国的抗拒和反对。它们提出了它们的联合提案，其目的实质上就是避开禁止原子武器和裁减军备的问题，而代之以收集军备情报的建议。
    苏联代表团对这项提案所作的修正案和建议遭到了三国的反对。它们为了替它们的反对态度辩解，便硬说苏联的建议没有规定禁止原子武器和国际监督两者同时实施。此外，他们又硬说苏联的建议没有规定对禁止原子武器和裁减军备的决议的执行情况进行经常的视察。可是当苏联说明它对这些问题的态度，并提出了具体的建议，主张禁止原子武器和国际监督两者同时实施，并为了建立适当的保证制度，使大会关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备的决议得到遵守，国际监督机构在无权干涉他国内政的条件下，有权进行经常的视察时，美、英、法三国这时又不仅拒绝接受苏联这些建议，而且甚至不同意在大会会议上加以讨论。
    美国在联合国内拥有的表决机器，在第六届大会上也像以往一样开动了起来，强使大会接受了一个决议，使联合国反而不设法解决关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备的问题。
    在这裁减军备委员会刚刚开始工作的时候，回顾一下这一切情形是非常必要的。
    现在提交裁减军备委员会考虑的有两个提案：一个包含着苏联的建议，另一个包含着三国的建议。
    因此，裁减军备委员会就面临着这样的问题：它应该讨论什么呢？它应该怎样开始它的工作呢？
    它是照着美国代表团企图强迫它接受的道路，白费唇舌地讨论收集军备情报的问题，而不管如何解决裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题呢？还是马上就毫不拖延地开始对和平事业真正有利的工作，马上开始研究禁止原子武器、裁减军备以及各国就它们的军备提出完整的官方报告的问题呢？
    这个工作是否能够成功，建立这个委员会是否有什么用处，是否值得，主要将取决于委员会要讨论些什么以及它怎样开始它的工作。
    美国代表提出了他的委员会工作计划。在这个计划里，整个事情就不过是收集军备情报。美国代表在提出这建议时说，这计划的措辞跟美、英、法三国以往在联合国大会上提出的提案是一致的。然而，在这“措辞”里，我们只是非常清楚明确地听到关于收集军备情报的话。裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题就根本没有提到。他搁开了这问题，而用什么收集军备情报的鬼话来代替。
    苏联的代表们曾经问美国的代表们，他们是否愿意支持裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭的武器的建议，因为如果通过了这样一个决议，就可能立刻获得一切国家完整的军备情报。美国代表在答复中却公然说，他的裁减军备委员会工作计划和这个问题，即裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题，毫无关系。因此，根据这个计划，委员会的工作就不可能产生能够解决这个重要问题的积极成果。美国这种态度并没有什么新的东西。
    美国一贯地怀抱着一个目标——获得其他国家的军备和武装部队的情报，但是它的原子武器的情报却要保持秘密，同时无论如何要使苏联关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备及武装部队的建议不能获得通过。
    现在，美国又不知第几次地再度以报告和检查军备和武装部队为名义，建议收集军备情报，再度企图隐藏禁止原子武器和裁减军备以及制止扩张军备运动的迫切需要，而吸引开全世界对这种迫切需要的注意。
    美国报纸在评论美国的态度时就公开地说：美国政府想把这整个问题化为全世界各国普遍报告军备和武装部队的情况，而不是裁减军备和禁止原子武器。
    我们认为，这里必须弄清楚，在裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题上，到底每一方面在过去和现在采取怎样的态度。要想这样做，最好的办法就是谈具体的事实和数字。我们现在就在这方面谈一谈吧。
    美国政府总是说苏联拥有庞大的军队，枉费心机地想把这作为口实，替扩张军备运动（特别是替美国军备的庞大增长）辩解。美国统治集团实行的扩张军备运动和侵略政策，使统治美国的垄断资本家得到很大的利润，我们认为，美国之所以扩张军备、并强迫别的国家进行扩张军备运动，其原因正是在这里。
    美国统治集团已经选择了侵略、扩张军备和发动新的世界战争的道路。我且引证一些事实吧。美国垄断资本的利润，在一九三六年到一九三九年，按没有纳税之前计算，每年平均是五十三亿美元；而在一九四二年到一九四五年这段战争期间，平均每年利润增加到二百二十七亿美元，也就是增加为和平时期的四倍。在一九五一年，在扩张军备运动和侵朝战争达到最高潮的时候，美国垄断资本的利润增长到美国历史上空前未有的纪录——四百四十八亿美元，几乎为第二次世界大战期间平均利润的两倍，为和平时期利润的八倍多。
    跟垄断资本获得这空前利润的同时，人民的境况是愈来愈坏，通货膨胀加紧了，生活费用上涨了，税收也大大增加了。根据国会纪录中发表的材料，美国目前各种税收的合计数量，比第二次世界大战期间诸年份的税收总数高百分之六十三点三。
    税收吞噬了人民收入的三分之一。在西欧各国，情形就更苦了。这些国家在美国统治集团的要求下，都正在进行扩张军备运动，准备另一次世界大战。在这些国家里，人民每年的收入中，平均有百分之四十七到百分之六十要缴税。这些数字是美国报纸不多几天之前发表的。它们指出：西欧国家税收之重，出乎一切想像之外。
    这一小撮的亿万富翁和百万富翁就是这样在人民大众的痛苦之上敛聚了他们的财富。美国大企业的代表之一杜邦就在最近的一次公开演讲中承认过：目前，也就是在疯狂的军备竞赛和朝鲜战争的时刻，情形也是和上两次世界大战当中一样，战争订货的绝大部分都归到大垄断资本家手里，因此，由此而产生的利润也都落到他们的口袋里。杜鲁门总统在一九五二年一月十六日最近一次致国会的国情咨文里也大体上证实了这一点。杜鲁门报告说：一九五一年仅是用于基本种类的战争开支的军事拨款就达到四百五十亿美元，美国垄断资本在没有纳税之前的利润为四百四十八亿美元，这是美国历史上最高的。
    就在这些年份里，美国拒绝了禁止原子武器，以疯狂的速度增加原子武器的生产和存储。
    在第二次世界大战以后，美国的原子扩张军备运动没有一天停止过。现在，这已经成了亿万本钱的事业，替美国垄断资本挣得巨额的利润。美国一九四五财政年度的预算中，用于生产原子武器的款项为四亿一千八百万美元，这方面的开支在一九五○财政年度增加为两倍，达到了八亿九千七百万美元。在一九五一年，这笔开支又增加了一倍，达到了十七亿美元。在今后两年的期间中，这方面的开支还要继续增长，预定增加到每年三十亿美元以上。美国政府的“和平”政策，美国武装部队在战后的“复员”真相便是这样。
    美国在第二次大战后不仅完全保留了它在外国领土上围绕着苏联的军事基地网，而且从战争刚刚结束的一天起，就开始扩大这基地网。
    在这个期间，美国代表在联合国内絮絮不休谈什么裁减军备，企图以收集军备情报来代替裁减军备和禁止原子武器。可是，就在这同时，美国统治集团却在进行疯狂的扩张军备运动，增加他们的武装部队，扩展军事基地，组织新的军事侵略同盟。根据不完全的官方材料，从一九四七年联合国开始讨论裁减军备的时候起，美国的武装部队实力增加为二点三倍多。据裁减军备委员会美国代表的发言，今天美国的武装部队总数已达三百五十万人。他们还计划在一九五二年内再增加二十二万人，军事后备队和国民警备队的增加还没有计算在内。
    如果把美国最近一些年来的军事费用和战争时期的军事费用作一比较，就可以看出：美国在开始侵略朝鲜以前很久的时候，一九四九财政年度的直接军事费用已经几乎达到第二次世界大战开头一年的军事费用的三倍，相当于战前一九四零年军事费用的十七倍了。一九五一财政年度的军事拨款，超过了战争时期一九四二年的军事拨款。指明用于即将来到的一九五二财政年度的战争拨款总数，超过了一九四三年所有的直接军事开支。
    在一九五一年第六届联合国大会上，美国顽固地拒绝裁减军备，也拒绝禁止原子武器。现在一九五二年美国仍然如此，这从美国提交裁减军备委员会的计划中可以看出来。
    这个委员会叫作裁减军备委员会，但是美国的计划非但丝毫不符合这个名义，也不符合解除军备的任务，甚至不符合委员会必须处理的裁减军备工作。
    美国代表团提出的委员会工作计划，是要把这个委员会变成一个讨论收集军备情报问题的委员会，因此，把收集军备情报问题代替对和平事业与国际安全有绝大重要性的禁止原子武器和裁减军备的问题。
    这种计划或许能符合美国情报机构的利益，因为它可借助于委员会而获得情报；但是这个计划根本就不符合委员会必须处理的禁止原子武器和裁减军备的工作。
    在适当的时候——在已通过禁止原子武器、裁减军备的决议的时候，向委员会提交完整的军备情报，当然是有其必要的。没有疑问的，到了那个时候，所有国家会认为向委员会提出必要的情报是当然的责任；到了那个时候，当然也没有人会拒绝提出这种情报。
    鉴于以上所述，委员会必须首先着手通过一个禁止原子武器和裁减军备的决议，而不应在提供军备情报问题上进行没有结果的讨论。这应该是十分明显的了。
    从美国的计划中可以看出：计划的拟订者已决心要使委员会在收集军备情报问题上进行没有结果的讨论，要在拖延对报告与审查情报问题的讨论以后，避免讨论裁减军备问题，虽然这个委员会的名称是叫做裁减军备委员会。事实上，美国代表是建议委员会放弃解决关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器及其它大规模毁灭性的武器的问题。
    美国的计划不提到裁减军备；这个计划的“第三项”把整个事情减少到拟定各方协议的各国计划，而这些计划经过各国对各国被容许拥有的军队和军备的问题举行谈判取得协议，这一项甚至不提裁减军备的必要性——这一切都不是偶然的。很明显，美国的计划是为了各国背着委员会举行谈判来增加军备而不是裁减军备。
    我不能不指出随之而起的情况就是以提供军备情报的问题代替禁止原子武器和裁减军备的问题，我也不能不指出：如我所已经指出的，美国的草案把这件事归结为各国政府间对各国军备计划取得协议，不是为了裁减军备，而是为了迫使各国加紧扩充军备运动。而所有这一切都将在裁减军备委员会的旗帜下，在无休止地谈论军备“情报的报告和检查”中进行。
    但是这样就意味着委员会将公然欺骗舆论。因为委员会不能开始欺骗舆论，所以不能接受美国计划作为裁减军备委员会的工作计划。
    在整个裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题上，有决定重要性的是通过一项裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭的武器（原子武器在内）的原则性决议。通过这样的决议，对于巩固和平是非常重要的。至于各国提供军备情报的问题，通过一项关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备的决议，马上便可能获得各国军备的完整情报。这样可以保证能够获得各国武装部队和军备实力的完整情报。
    苏联代表团认为，本委员会既然名为裁减军备委员会，开始工作之初首先就应该讨论和通过关于禁止原子武器以及主要从五大国开始进行裁减军备的决议。因此，苏联代表团奉苏联政府的指示，提出联合国裁减军备委员会工作计划如下：
    （Ⅰ）禁止原子武器、裁减军备和提供军备情报报告。
    （一）通过关于无条件禁止原子武器以及其他一切大规模毁灭性的武器的决议。为这禁令的执行，建立严格的国际监督，禁止原子武器和国际监督两者应该同时实行。
    （二）通过一项裁减军备和武装部队的决议：
    （甲）拟订一个各方同意的计划，建议五大国——苏联、美国、中华人民共和国、英国和法国在一年期间内裁减各自现有军备和武装部队的三分之
    一。
    （乙）通过一个决议，决定召开世界会议，研讨大量裁减军备和武装部队的问题，并研讨禁止原子武器和为这项禁令的实行建立严格的国际监督的实际措施。
    （三）通过一项决议，规定在禁止原子武器和裁减军备的决议通过之后，各国政府必须马上就其军备和武装部队的情况，包括原子武器及在外国领土上的军事基地的情况，提出完整的官方情报。
    （Ⅱ）研讨有关破坏细菌战禁令、不能允许使用细菌武器以及惩办违反细菌战禁令者的问题。
    （Ⅲ）拟制提交安全理事会考虑的公约草案，其中规定各种措施以保证：
    （一）禁止原子武器和停止其生产；
    （二）现存的原子弹仅用于民用目的；
    （三）为禁止原子武器公约的执行建立严格的国际监督。
    （Ⅳ）拟订一项规定，以在安全理事会之内设立国际监督机构，其职权为：
    （一）监督关于禁止原子武器的决议的执行；
    （二）监督关于裁减军备和武装部队的决议的执行；
    （三）审查各国政府就它们的军备和武装部队情况提出的情报。
    （Ⅴ）为了建立适当的保证制度，以使禁止原子武器和裁减军备的决议得到遵守，国际管制机构应在无权干涉各国内政的情况下，有权进行经常的视察。
    我们所提出的计划规定研讨关于无条件禁止原子武器及其他一切大规模屠杀人民的武器，同时对实施这个禁令建立严格的国际监督，以期禁止原子武器和国际监督同时实行。
    我们的计划还规定裁减军备委员会必须立即开始研讨裁减军备的问题。
    裁减军备委员会的有效的工作计划必须规定制订计划，建议立即通过一项关于禁止原子武器和对执行这个禁令，对裁减军备和武装部队建立国际监督的原则性决议。
    苏联所提出的裁减军备委员会的工作计划还规定各个政府提出完整的关于军备（包括原子武器在内）情况的官方情报，这种情报必须在通过禁止原子武器和裁减军备的决议后立即提出。
    我们提出的计划还规定研讨关于违反细菌战禁令、不容许使用细菌武器和惩办违反细菌战禁令者的问题。由下述事实可以显然看出这个问题的紧急性，这个事实就是：今天，美国军队已经在大规模使用细菌武器，从而穷凶极恶地违反了关于禁止可耻的、不人道的战争——细菌战的国际协定。这种战争是正直人民的良心和一切文明民族的良心所不能容忍的。委员会不能把这个问题置之不理。
    现在使用了细菌武器的是这样一个国家的军队，这个国家的政府曾经拒绝批准禁止在战时使用窒息性毒气及其他类似的毒气和细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书，因此，这个问题就更加必须引起委员会的注意。在一九四九年七月日内瓦会议制订保护战争受难者的国际公约时，美国政府曾反对禁止一切大规模毁灭人民的武器。
    在那次会议上，美国代表团曾拒绝接受苏联代表团提出的建议，苏联代表团当时建议通过一个声明说：“使用目的在于大规模屠杀人民的细菌和化学武器、原子或其他武器的行为，是违反国际法的基本原则的。”
    最近，美国的一些将领，例如，劳克斯、克利西和布尔等，曾经在他们的谈话中证实：美国老早就在紧张地准备细菌战了。我不能不提醒大家注意下述事实：美国国务卿艾奇逊虽然企图拙劣地否认美军使用了细菌武器，但是他却未想表示反对使用这种武器，也没有斥责这种罪恶的战争手段。
    联合国裁减军备委员会必须研讨这个问题。委员会必须斥责违反禁止细菌武器的公约的人，以阻止使用这种武器，并惩办违反上述禁止细菌武器的公约的人。
    委员会如果通过苏联代表团所提出的工作计划，研究这个计划里所包含的建议，并根据这些建议拟定具体的方案，那就会有助于加速解决早就应该解决的禁止原子武器和裁减军备之类的问题了。但是，联合国内的美英集团，首先是美国的顽固抗拒，直到今天还在妨碍着这些问题的解决。
