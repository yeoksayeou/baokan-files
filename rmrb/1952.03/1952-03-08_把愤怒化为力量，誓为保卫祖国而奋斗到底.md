    Turn Anger into Strength, Vow to Fight to the End to Defend the Motherland
    Comrade Editor: After the inhuman American imperialists frantically spread bacteria on the Korean battlefield, they dared to extend their bloody claws to our sacred territory, spreading bacteria in Northeast China,妄想attempting to slaughter our people. When we heard this news, our blood boiled, and we gnashed our teeth in hatred for the towering crimes of these beasts. We wish we could immediately rush to Korea to punish this group of man-eating savages.
    Although the American invading army is struggling madly on the Korean front, they cannot escape the fate of a miserable defeat. This bestial behavior of the American imperialists can only arouse greater anger from the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world, and can only suffer more severe blows from the Chinese and Korean people.
    We, all the students of Peking University, must turn anger into strength, be prepared at all times to respond to the call of the motherland, and vow to fight to the end to defend our great motherland.
    All students of Peking University

    把愤怒化为力量，誓为保卫祖国而奋斗到底
    编辑同志：灭绝人性的美帝国主义者，在朝鲜战场上疯狂地撒布细菌之后，竟胆敢把它的血腥魔爪伸向我们的神圣国土，在我国东北撒布细菌，妄想屠杀我国人民。当我们听了这个消息之后，我们的血都沸腾起来了，我们咬牙切齿地痛恨这群野兽们的滔天罪行，我们恨不得立刻赶到朝鲜，惩罚这群吃人生番。
    尽管美国侵略军在朝鲜前线穷凶极恶地挣扎，但他们是逃不出惨败的命运的。美帝国主义者这种兽行，只能激起中朝人民和世界人民更大的愤怒，只能遭到中朝人民更严重的打击。
    我们北京大学全体同学，一定要把愤怒化为力量，时刻准备着响应祖国的号召，誓为保卫我们伟大的祖国而奋斗到底。
    北京大学全体同学
