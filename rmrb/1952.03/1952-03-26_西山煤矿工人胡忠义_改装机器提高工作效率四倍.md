    Hu Zhongyi, Worker at Xishan Coal Mine
    Modifies Machine to Increase Work Efficiency Fourfold
    Comrade Editor: Hu Zhongyi, a worker in the electric saw room of the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine, successfully modified a small circular saw and drill sleeve, increasing work efficiency more than fourfold. The electric saw room has a grinder specifically for sharpening electric saw teeth. During the anti-corruption movement, Hu Zhongyi heard the Party branch secretary say, "While 'fighting tigers,' everyone must also do a good job in production." Therefore, after work, he actively participated in the struggle, and when he came to work, he used his brain to work. He used an eighteen-inch diameter circular saw that had been replaced from a large circular saw machine in the past, and after modification, ground it into a small circular saw with a diameter of fifteen inches. He also made a drill sleeve and installed a live drill tip. This modification solved two difficulties. First, in the past, the large circular saw machine could only saw larger pieces of wood, and smaller pieces of wood had to be sawn manually, but now this is no longer necessary. Second, in the past, when sawing small wooden plaques, each worker could make 800 pieces (including drilling the holes in the plaques), but now each worker can make more than 3,300 pieces, with an efficiency increase of more than fourfold per worker.

    西山煤矿工人胡忠义
    改装机器提高工作效率四倍
    编辑同志：太原西山煤矿电锯房工人胡忠义改装小圆锯和钻套成功，提高了工作效率四倍多。电锯房有一部砂轮机是专门供电锯磨齿用的。在反贪污运动中，胡忠义听党支部书记说：“大家一面‘打虎’，一面要搞好生产。”因此，他下了班就积极参加斗争，一上班就开动脑筋工作。他利用过去从大圆锯机上替换下来的一个十八吋直径的圆锯，经过改装，磨研成一个直径十五吋的小圆锯。他还做了一个钻套，按了一个活钻尖子。这次改装，解决了两个困难。第一，过去大圆锯机只能锯较大的木材，小的木材要用人工来锯，现在不用这样了。第二，过去锯小木牌，每工可作到八百个（钻牌子的窟窿在内），现在每工可作到三千三百个以上，每工效率较前提高了四倍多。
