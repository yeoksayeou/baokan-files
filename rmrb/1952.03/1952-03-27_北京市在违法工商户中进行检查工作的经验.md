Beijing's Committee for Saving has dispatched a large number of inspection teams since February 12th to conduct inspections of industrial and commercial households that are seriously violating the law and refusing to confess. This strong fighting force has achieved significant results in the face-to-face struggle with illegal capitalists, conquering the stubborn fortresses of thousands of illegal capitalists. The significant role played by the inspection teams is an important factor in the victorious completion of the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners on work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence. The following are the working experiences of the Beijing inspection teams.

I. Preparing for Battle Beforehand

The various inspection teams in Beijing are composed of personnel drawn from all fields. There are cadres from government organs, public security cadres, tax personnel, literary and art workers, university professors and students, and many workers, shop assistants, and even senior staff members who had temporarily strayed but returned to the ranks of the working class. Such a temporary work group, operating in a complex and sharp class struggle, must make preparations beforehand. Before the inspection teams set out, the Municipal Committee for Saving and the leaders of the inspection teams convened meetings to educate everyone, making everyone realize that although the bourgeoisie has a certain positive role in the construction of the new China, it also has a dark and corrupt side, which is its class nature of prioritizing profit and harming others for self-interest and speculation. The working class must draw a clear line from the bourgeoisie ideologically. At the same time, it was explained that this is a serious class struggle, and illegal capitalists will do everything possible to resist and sabotage the inspection work. Therefore, vigilance should be heightened, and the determination to fight to the end should be held, without being blinded by any deceptive means of illegal capitalists, and preventing right-leaning errors from occurring in the inspection work. Due to the emphasis and full ideological education, the vast majority of inspection teams in Beijing have stood firm on the class stand in their work and have promptly exposed the vile tricks of illegal capitalists, such as minimizing their crimes, talking about small matters but not large ones, falsely crying and feigning poverty, acting crazy, acting stupid, pretending to talk in their sleep, and repeatedly guaranteeing with their "heads" that they have no problems. The deputy manager of Guangxing Saw Factory once issued a guarantee to the inspection team three times, but his tricks were exposed by the inspection team, and he had to initially admit that he had gained 500 million yuan from cutting corners on work and materials. However, some individual inspection team members did not have sufficient understanding of the conspiracies and tricks of illegal capitalists, and as soon as they saw them putting on a pitiful appearance, they softened their hearts and asked to withdraw their troops; or they lost their vigilance and did not supervise illegal capitalists strictly, so that the capitalists burned their accounts during the inspection period, making the inspection work unable to move forward quickly and the battle dragging on. These serious errors, although discovered and corrected in time, show that ideological education is extremely important for the staff of the inspection teams.

Another important preparation for the inspection teams is that everyone must understand and be familiar with the policies of the People's Government for dealing with illegal industrial and commercial households. It should be explained to everyone that the purpose of this struggle is to eliminate the illegal acts of bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners on work and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence by the bourgeoisie, not to eliminate the bourgeoisie. And the method to achieve this goal is to repeatedly explain the policies to illegal industrial and commercial households, mobilize them to confess and report, and strive for lenient treatment from the People's Government; if they resolutely refuse to confess their problems, they will be subject to increased punishment, and methods such as beating, scolding, and extorting confessions should not be used. It is particularly important to make the staff of the inspection teams clearly realize that mobilizing and relying on the workers and shop assistants of private factories and shops, and striving to win over senior staff members to fight against illegal capitalists, is a key to striving for the victorious completion of the inspection work. Most of the inspection teams in Beijing correctly implemented this policy, repeatedly and patiently educated the workers, shop assistants, and senior staff members, raised their class consciousness, and inspired them to boldly report the illegal facts of the capitalists and engage in face-to-face reasoning struggles with the capitalists. Many fortresses were conquered by relying on them. However, some individual inspection team members mistakenly emphasized that the wages of some shop assistants and workers were high and their class consciousness was low; emphasized that workers did not know much; emphasized that senior staff members had been bought off by the capitalists, and therefore were unwilling to use great efforts to mobilize and educate shop assistants and workers, and strive to unite senior staff members. Some individual inspection team members even treated staff members or shop assistants and workers in the same way as they treated capitalists, which dampened the emotions of the shop assistants and workers, forming a phenomenon of the inspection team being divorced from the masses and fighting alone, causing the inspection work to take some detours.

Before the inspection teams set off, they must also, as far as possible, study and grasp the materials reported by the masses, understand the situation of the inspection objects—the capitalists and the shop assistants and workers of the factory or store—determine the focus of the inspection, and appropriately allocate manpower. In order to grasp the situation, it is necessary to maintain close contact with relevant units such as the District Committee for Saving and the District Trade Union Office before and during the work. For example, a team inspecting Dingchang Hardware Store, after accepting the task, first went to the district to find the reporting materials, learned about the situation of the employees from the trade union, and then convened a meeting of the inspection team members. After studying the situation and materials, it was determined that the focus of the inspection was the theft of state property and tax evasion; the method of work was to rely on the shop assistants and strive to unite an accountant and an outside runner. In order to achieve these plans, the team members divided the work. This made the work unfold in an orderly manner. This shows that attaching importance to investigation and research, and carrying out work in a planned and step-by-step manner, is an important key to achieving victory.

II. Fully Explain the Policy and Deeply Mobilize Shop Assistants and Workers

After the inspection team arrives at the site, it first convenes a meeting of all personnel in the private factory or shop, explaining that the task of the inspection team is to inspect the illegal acts of the capitalists, clearly pointing out the two different treatments for illegal capitalists and shop assistants and workers, the capitalists must be isolated, and the shop assistants and workers must be mobilized to report illegal capitalists. Then, the inspection team assigns appropriate people to talk to the capitalists, repeatedly explaining the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance," and mobilizing them to thoroughly confess. The other team members of the inspection team then convene meetings of shop assistants and workers, explaining the political significance of the "Five-Anti" movement, what attitude the working class should take in the "Five-Anti" movement, the boundaries between the working class and the bourgeoisie, the interests and future of the working class, etc., and mobilizing them to report the illegal facts of the capitalists. If some shop assistants and workers have done some illegal things for the capitalists in the past, it is especially necessary to explain to them that this is mainly because they were deceived and used by the capitalists, and the capitalists should be responsible. As long as the explanation is clear, the People's Government will never pursue it. And it should go deep into the shop assistants and workers, and use the method of "heart-to-heart talks" to inspire them to talk about how they have been cruelly exploited and abused by the capitalists, what ideological concerns they have, what the personal relationship between the capitalists and the shop assistants and workers is like, clues to the illegal facts of the capitalists, etc. After the inspection team has grasped these materials, it will address the ideological concerns of the workers and shop assistants, such as fear of unemployment, fear of retaliation, and the inability to save face for fellow villagers and relatives, and explain to them that the policy of the People's Government is to protect the jobs and safety of those who report. In particular, it is necessary to seize the discovered facts of cruel exploitation and abuse of shop assistants and workers, as well as the illegal facts of the capitalists, to conduct class education for all employees, so that they can recognize the ugly faces of the unscrupulous merchants, and gradually raise this understanding to the level of protecting the interests of the class and the interests of the country and the people. In this way, the general shop assistants and workers will stand with the inspection team and fiercely open fire on the illegal capitalists. For example, a team inspecting Dingchang Hardware Store learned from a conversation with apprentice Ma Weishou that his daily work was very heavy, and according to the contract established when he entered the store, he should be given 60 catties of millet per month, but the capitalist only gave him 30 catties. The inspection team used this fact to conduct class education for the shop assistants, so that the shop assistants reported more than 20 pieces of material about the capitalist bribing cadres and deceiving and threatening the shop assistants during the movement within one day. After a team inspecting Guangda Lumber Factory arrived at the site, because the capitalists had already arranged various "defenses," using money to buy off salesman Sun Xichou, accountant Wang Yongqian, etc., and using backward worker Wang Wenhua to occupy the leadership position of the grassroots trade union, the work of the inspection team encountered great difficulties. However, because this team was able to resolutely rely on the workers, talk to the workers separately, and have one or two staff members spend the whole day with the workers, holding meetings and discussing work together, and conducting in-depth education, they finally broke through the difficulties, mobilized the workers, reported all the illegal acts of the capitalists, and exposed the hypocritical mask of Wang Wenhua pretending to be progressive. Worker Bao Zhitao handed over a board on which he recorded the facts of the unscrupulous merchants of the factory stealing state property since liberation, using only the ten Arabic numerals he knew. This board was of great help to the inspection team. Bao Zhitao's patriotic actions educated other workers, and as a result, all employees organized to actively participate in the struggle to win over senior staff members to jointly besiege the unscrupulous merchants.

    北京市在违法工商户中进行检查工作的经验
    林洪
    从二月十二日开始，北京市节约检查委员会连续派出了大批检查组，对严重违法而又拒不坦白的工商户进行检查。这一支坚强的战斗队伍，在和违法资本家作面对面的斗争中获得显著的成绩，攻克了上千户违法资本家的顽固堡垒。检查组所发挥的重大作用，是胜利地完成反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报运动的一个重要因素。下面是北京市检查组的工作经验。
    一、做好战斗前的准备工作
    北京市的各个检查组，是从各方面抽调来的人员所组成的。有机关干部、公安干部、税务人员、文艺工作者、大学教授和大学生，还有很多工人、店员以至曾经暂时失足而又回到工人阶级队伍的高级职员参加。这样一个临时组成的工作组，要在复杂尖锐的阶级斗争中作战，必须事前做好准备工作。在检查组出发之前，市节约检查委员会和检查组的领导人即召开会议，向大家进行教育，使每个人都认识到资产阶级虽然在新中国的建设中有一定的积极作用，但是它有黑暗腐朽的一面，这就是它的唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的阶级本质。工人阶级必须从思想上和资产阶级划清界限。同时说明：这是一场严重的阶级斗争，违法资本家一定会千方百计地抗拒和破坏检查工作。因此应提高警惕，抱定战斗到底的决心，不为违法资本家的任何欺骗手段所蒙蔽，防止在检查工作中发生右倾错误。由于重视并充分进行了思想教育，北京市绝大多数的检查组在工作中都站稳了阶级立场，及时地揭穿了违法资本家避重就轻、谈小不谈大、假哭，卖穷，装疯，装傻，假装说梦话，三番五次地以“脑袋”担保自己没有问题等等的卑鄙伎俩。广兴电锯厂的副经理曾经三次对检查组具结，但他的诡计都被检查组揭破了，他不得不初步承认偷工减料所得达五亿元。但也有个别检查组的工作人员对违法资本家的阴谋诡计认识不足，一看见他们装出一副可怜相，就软了心，要求收兵；或者是失掉了警惕性，对违法资本家监视不严，以致在检查期间资本家还烧掉了账目，使检查工作不能迅速前进，战斗拖延不决。这些严重的错误虽经及时发觉，并已纠正，但它说明了思想教育工作对于检查组的工作人员是极为重要的。
    检查组的另一重要准备工作，是必须使每个人了解并熟悉人民政府处理违法工商户的政策。应该向大家说明，这一斗争的目的，是肃清资产阶级的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报的违法行为，而不是要消灭资产阶级。而达到这一目的的方法，是反复向违法工商户讲明政策，动员他们坦白、检举，争取人民政府的宽大处理；如果他们坚决不肯交代问题，就会受到加重惩罚，而不应该采用打骂逼供等方式。特别重要的，是要使检查组的工作人员明确地认识到发动和依靠私营工厂、商店的工人、店员，并争取高级职员来向违法资本家进行斗争，这是争取检查工作胜利完成的重要关键。北京市的大多数检查组都正确地执行了这一方针，反复地耐心地对工人店员和高级职员进行了教育，提高了他们的阶级觉悟，启发他们大胆地检举资本家的违法事实，和资方展开面对面的说理斗争。许多堡垒都是依靠他们攻破的。但也有个别检查组的工作人员，错误地强调某些店员工人的待遇高，阶级觉悟低；强调工人知道的事情不多；强调高级职员已被资本家收买，因而不肯用大的力量去发动和教育店员工人，争取团结高级职员。甚至有个别检查组的工作人员，用对待资本家的办法来对待职员或店员工人，这样就打击了店员工人的情绪，形成检查组脱离群众，孤军作战的现象，使检查工作走了一些弯路。
    检查组在出发前，还必须尽可能地研究和掌握群众的检举材料，了解检查的对象——资本家和该厂该店的店员工人的情况，确定检查的重点，适当地分配人力。为了掌握情况，必须在事前和工作进行期间，与区节约检查委员会、区工会办事处等有关单位取得密切联系。如检查鼎昌五金行的一个组，在接受任务后，先到区里找到了检举材料，从工会了解到职工情况，然后召开了一个检查组工作人员的会议，经过对情况和材料的研究，确定检查的重点是盗窃国家资财和偷税漏税；工作的方法是依靠店员，争取团结一个会计和一个跑外。为了实现这些计划，小组的人员进行了分工。这样就使工作有条不紊地展开了。这就说明，重视调查研究，有计划、有步骤地进行工作，是取得胜利的重要关键。
    二、充分说明政策，深入发动
    店员工人
    检查组到达现场后，首先召开这一私营工厂或商店的全体人员会议，说明检查组的任务是检查资本家的违法行为，明确指出对违法资本家和店员工人的两种不同待遇，资本家必须隔离、孤立起来，店员工人则必须发动起来，检举违法资本家。然后，检查组即分配适当的人和资本家谈话，反复说明“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”的政策，动员他彻底坦白。检查组的其他组员，则召开店员工人会议，说明“五反”的政治意义，工人阶级在“五反”运动中应采取什么态度，工人阶级和资产阶级的界限，工人阶级的利益和前途等等，动员他们检举资本家的违法事实。如果有店员工人过去曾替资本家干过一些犯法的事情，就特别要向他们说明，这主要是他受了资本家的欺骗和利用，应由资本家负责。只要交代清楚，人民政府决不追究。并应深入到店员工人中，用“谈心”的方式，启发他们谈出自己怎样受资本家的残酷剥削和虐待，他们有那些思想顾虑，资本家和店员工人之间的人事关系如何，资本家违法事实的线索等等。检查组掌握了这些材料以后，即针对工人店员怕失业、怕报复以及拉不下同乡、亲戚的面子等思想顾虑，向他们说明人民政府的政策是保障检举者的职业和安全。特别要抓紧已发现的店员工人受残酷剥削和虐待以及资本家的违法事实，对全体职工进行阶级教育，使他们认清奸商的丑恶嘴脸，把这种认识逐步提到爱护阶级和爱护国家、人民的利益的高度。这样，一般店员工人就会和检查组站在一起，勇猛地向违法资本家开火。如检查鼎昌五金行的一个组，在和学徒马维受谈话中，知道他每天的工作很繁重，按照入店时所立合同的规定，每月应给他六十斤小米，但资本家只给他三十斤。检查组就用这一事实对店员进行阶级教育，使店员在一天之内检举了资方贿赂干部以及在运动中欺骗、威胁店员的材料达二十多件。检查广大制材厂的一组到达现场后，因为资本家早已布置了各种“防线”，用金钱收买了营业员孙锡畴、会计王永乾等，并利用落后工人王文华窃据了基层工会的领导地位，使检查组的工作遇到很大困难。但因为这个组能坚决依靠工人，分头和工人谈话，并由一两个工作人员整天和工人在一起，共同开会，讨论工作，进行了深入的教育，终于突破了困难，把工人发动起来，检举了资方的一切违法行为，揭穿了王文华伪装进步的假面具。工人包志涛交出一块板子，上面是他用仅仅认识的十个阿拉伯字母所记录的该厂奸商自解放后盗窃国家资财的事实。这块板子对检查组的帮助很大。包志涛的爱国行动教育了其他工人，结果全体职工组织起来，积极参加了争取高级职员共同围攻奸商的斗争。
