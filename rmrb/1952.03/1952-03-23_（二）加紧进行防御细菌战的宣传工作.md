    (II) Intensify Propaganda Work on Defense Against Bacterial Warfare
    To combat the American aggressors' bacterial warfare is one of the most urgent and important tasks for the people of the whole country at present. Therefore, propaganda organizations, various propaganda groups, propagandists, propaganda team members, and active elements of the masses in all parts of the country should be mobilized to widely disseminate information about defense against bacterial warfare among the people.
    What should be propagated? Generally speaking, we should, in connection with specific facts, explain to the masses that the American aggressors' conduct of bacterial warfare is the most savage and despicable atrocity, so that everyone can further recognize from this atrocity that American imperialism is the enemy of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world. We should, in connection with the Korean war situation and the current domestic and international situation, explain that the American aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons is a dying struggle after suffering a disastrous defeat militarily, and encourage everyone to strengthen their determination and confidence in the struggle against American imperialism. We should call on the masses to strive for the complete victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and to do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy, spring plowing and drought prevention, etc., to further support the Chinese People's Volunteers and punish the American bacterial war criminals. We should educate the masses not to be paralyzed by this insidious conspiracy of American imperialism, but to raise their vigilance, and widely mobilize everyone to organize and carry out patriotic health and epidemic prevention campaigns to completely eliminate or prepare to eliminate at any time the poisonous insects with bacteria spread by the American aggressors.
    Specific propaganda and education should be carried out in light of the different ideological situations of the masses in various places to solve ideological and specific problems among the masses. At present, some people in some places lack the necessary knowledge of bacterial warfare and do not know how to defend against bacterial warfare, which inevitably leads to some panic. For these people, we should patiently explain and educate them based on science and facts, and introduce more knowledge and methods of eradicating bacteria. If the masses understand how to deal with bacterial warfare, their confidence in fighting the enemy will also be enhanced. If rumors are found, the root cause should be immediately investigated to find out the rumor-mongering and sabotage elements and punish them.
    There are also some people who are negligent about the bacterial warfare of the American aggressors. They think that it is nothing to the enemy to spread a few flies and mosquitoes. Some backward people even do not believe that infectious diseases can be artificially manufactured; others feel that the places where the American aggressors spread bacteria are far away from them and have nothing to do with them. We should correct their wrong ideas and point out that people everywhere should participate in the struggle against bacterial warfare and conscientiously carry out epidemic prevention campaigns in order to quickly and thoroughly defeat the American robbers' bacterial warfare.
    In propaganda work, newspapers should be fully utilized to organize the masses to read newspapers regularly so that everyone can understand the political situation at any time and learn the necessary epidemic prevention knowledge. At present, some places neglect the propaganda work for defense against bacterial warfare and neglect the activities of newspaper reading organizations and various mass propaganda organizations, which is not right and should be corrected immediately.

    （二）加紧进行防御细菌战的宣传工作
    打击美国侵略者的细菌战，是全国人民当前最迫切最重要的任务之一。因之，全国各地的宣传工作机关、各种宣传组织、宣传员、宣传队员和群众积极分子，都应该动员起来，广泛地向人民群众进行关于防御细菌战的宣传。
    宣传些什么呢？一般地说，应当联系具体事实向群众说明：美国侵略者进行细菌战，乃是一种最野蛮、最卑鄙的暴行，使大家从这种暴行中进一步认识美帝国主义是中朝人民和全世界人民的敌人。应当联系朝鲜战局和当前国内、国际形势，说明美国侵略者使用细菌武器，是军事上遭受惨败以后的垂死挣扎，鼓舞大家向美帝国主义进行斗争的决心和信心。应当号召群众努力争取“三反”和“五反”斗争的彻底胜利、做好增产节约、春耕防旱等工作，以进一步支援中国人民志愿军，惩罚美国细菌战犯。应当教育群众，对于美帝国主义这一恶毒阴谋不要麻痹，而要提高警惕，并且广泛发动大家组织起来，开展爱国的卫生防疫运动，彻底扑灭或准备随时扑灭美国侵略者撒下的带有细菌的毒虫。
    针对各地群众不同的思想情况，要进行具体的宣传教育，以解决群众中的思想问题和具体问题。目前，有些地方的群众对细菌战缺乏必要的知识，不知道防御细菌战的办法，以致不免发生某些恐慌心理，对于这些群众，应该根据科学和事实，耐心地进行解释教育，多多介绍扑灭细菌的知识和办法，群众懂得了对付细菌战办法，与敌人作斗争的信心也就会提高。如发现谣言，应当立即追根究底，找出造谣破坏的分子，予以制裁。
    也有一些人对美国侵略者的细菌战麻痹大意。他们以为敌人撒几个苍蝇、蚊子没有什么了不起，有一部分落后的群众甚至不相信传染病能用人工方法制造出来；还有人觉得美国侵略者撒布细菌的地方离自己很远，对自己没有什么关系。我们应该纠正他们这种错误想法，指出任何地方的人都应该参加到反细菌战的斗争中来，并认真进行防疫运动，才能迅速地彻底地打败美国强盗的细菌战。
    在宣传工作中，应该充分利用报纸，组织群众经常阅读报纸，使大家能随时了解政治形势，学习到必要的防疫知识。目前有些地方忽视对于防御细菌战的宣传工作，忽视读报组织和各种群众宣传组织的活动，都是不应该的，应该立即纠正这种现象。
