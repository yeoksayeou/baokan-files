    A Message of Congratulations to the Oslo Meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council
    The meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council is about to be held in Oslo, the capital of Norway. This meeting is being held at a time when the American aggressors are conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, and is of great significance. We wish this meeting a success and a new victory for the people of the world in their struggle for peace. Since the first session of the World Peace Council in Berlin last February, the world peace movement has become more and more magnificent. More and more people around the world have united under the banner of striving for peace. The number of people demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact is approaching 600 million. The voices of peace-loving people opposing aggressive wars and demanding lasting peace are getting louder and louder.
    However, the American aggressors openly disregard the wishes of the people of the world and, in violation of the resolution of the Second World Peace Congress on the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons, have barbarously launched an unprecedented large-scale bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. After Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, on behalf of the Chinese people, sent two telegrams to the World Peace Council on February 25 and March 10, accusing the American aggressors of this monstrous crime, Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, issued a statement on March 8, calling on world public opinion to condemn the crimes of the American aggressors. Peace-loving people's organizations and progressive public opinion circles in countries all over the world have raised serious protests, demanding sanctions against the American bacteriological warfare crimes. Acheson, Ridgway and their ilk are now trying to deny their crimes by despicable and shameless gangster means, but they cannot deny it.
    We believe that the Executive Bureau meeting of the World Peace Council will discuss the monstrous crimes of the American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare and will take concrete steps to mobilize the people of the world to rise up and stop the monstrous crimes of the American aggressors. Because the American aggressors' barbaric use of bacteriological weapons not only threatens China and Korea, but also threatens the whole world. It not only threatens the safety of mankind, but also insults the dignity of mankind. To cut off the American aggressors' demonic hands from spreading germs and to give the American bacteriological warfare crimes the punishment they deserve has become the unanimous demand of the people of the world. The World Peace Council, an organization representing the will for peace of the people of the world, will certainly contribute all its strength and play its great role in this struggle.

### 祝世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议

    祝世界和平理事会执行局奥斯陆会议
    世界和平理事会执行局会议即在挪威首都奥斯陆举行。这个会议召开于美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的时候，是具有极重大的意义的。我们预祝这个会议的成功，预祝全世界人民为和平而奋斗的新的胜利。去年二月世界和平理事会第一届会议在柏林开过以后，世界和平运动是愈来愈加波澜壮阔了。全世界人民已经愈来愈多地团结到争取和平的大旗下面来了。要求五大国缔结和平公约的人数，已经接近六亿。爱好和平的人民反对侵略战争，要求持久和平的呼声，越来越响亮了。
    但是，美国侵略者公然不顾全世界人民的愿望，违反第二届世界保卫和平大会关于禁止使用细菌武器的决议，野蛮地在朝鲜和我国东北开始了空前大规模的细菌战。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若代表我国人民在二月二十五日和三月十日两次致电世界和平理事会，控诉美国侵略者这一滔天罪行之后，世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在三月八日发表声明，号召全世界舆论起来斥责美国侵略者的罪行。全世界各国爱好和平的人民团体和进步舆论界，都提出了严重的抗议，要求制裁美国细菌战罪行。艾奇逊、李奇微之流现在正企图以卑鄙无耻的流氓手段来抵赖他们的罪行，但这是抵赖不了的。
    我们相信，此次世界和平理事会执行局的会议将讨论美国侵略者进行细菌战的滔天罪行，并将采取具体步骤来发动全世界人民，一致奋起，制止美国侵略者的滔天罪行。因为美国侵略者野蛮地使用细菌武器，不仅威胁着中朝两国，也威胁着全世界。不仅威胁着人类的安全，而且侮辱了人类的尊严。斩断美国侵略者撒布细菌的魔手，并给美国细菌战罪行以应得的制裁，已经成为全世界人民的一致要求。世界和平理事会，这个代表着全世界人民和平意志的组织，必将在这一斗争中贡献它的一切力量，发挥它的巨大作用。
