Since the launch of the anti-corruption movement in the Central People's Government's Ministry of Railways, all family members of the railway ministry's employees, under the direct leadership of the Party and the trade union, have actively participated in this great class struggle and have achieved great results. As of now, there have been over thirty cases of wives reporting their husbands or persuading them to confess, and family members have reported over two hundred pieces of material regarding other corrupt elements, including some major cases.

At the beginning of the movement, the family members of employees did not fully understand the political significance of the movement. Some said, "Anti-corruption is a matter for employees; housewives can't manage these things." Others said, "I stay at home all day taking care of the children and don't participate in work, so I don't understand the situation." In response to these thoughts, the work team first mobilized some of the activists among the family members to carry out ideological preparation among the families. Then, a mobilization meeting of all employee family members was held, to report on the significance of the movement, explaining the relationship between this movement and the interests of each family, and using examples of "comparing the present with the past" and "comparing the sweet with the bitter" to enlighten their political consciousness. After the meeting, small group discussions were held to allow everyone to express their views on the movement. Some talked about the pain of queuing to buy corn flour during the period of Japanese puppet rule, and others complained about the depreciation of currency and the daily price increases during the Kuomintang rule, making it impossible to make a living. Everyone unanimously believed:

"Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, not only are prices stable, but life is also improving every day. Everyone has personally experienced who is good and who is bad. Therefore, today the bourgeoisie wants to attack the Communist Party and the working class and destroy our happy life. We must fight back against the bourgeoisie and eliminate all corrupt elements and thieves." Thus, through meetings of all sizes, family members universally recognized that opposing corruption is a serious class struggle.

When all employee family members recognized the political significance of this movement and expressed their willingness to participate in the struggle, the work team held a second mobilization meeting, repeatedly explaining policies to dispel any possible ideological concerns (such as fear of hurting feelings, fear of harming relatives by reporting them, fear of retaliation, etc.), and calling on them to boldly report illegal capitalists and corrupt elements. Then, through the original family organization, core groups were formed by activists to visit and hold discussions with each courtyard and household, repeatedly publicizing policies. This mobilization was both widespread and in-depth. It not only ensured that every family member understood the policies, but also enabled them to participate in the movement with practical actions. At the North Gate Warehouse employee family meeting, everyone adopted the method of calculating detailed accounts, discovered the stolen goods of corrupt elements, and reported two corrupt elements. An old lady in the Fating Temple employee family personally sat at the door to observe the movements of corrupt elements, and finally discovered the corrupt acts of the corrupt elements, making the corrupt elements feel that "the net of justice is spread everywhere, and there is nowhere to hide." At large and small mass meetings, employee family members rushed to report corrupt elements.

After all employee family members universally participated in the anti-corruption struggle and achieved remarkable results, the Ministry of Railways held a meeting attended by more than 1,500 employee family members, announcing the achievements of employee family members in fighting "tigers" in the previous stage, commending family members who had done good work, increasing everyone's confidence, and encouraging everyone to make persistent efforts to continue reporting corrupt elements. This meeting made the fighting spirit of employee family members even higher. In the group discussions after the meeting, they all unanimously expressed their determination to fight "tigers," and immediately wrote more than seventy pieces of reporting material. Xu Zhiguo's wife said at the meeting, "I must mobilize my husband to confess thoroughly as soon as possible. Even if our life is temporarily harder because of returning the stolen money, I am willing. If he doesn't confess, I will resolutely report him!" Some family members said, "Today, our women have turned over and should take the attitude of masters to report corrupt and thieving elements and fully exert our strength." Xu Jing, the wife of engineer Zhao Shoulou of the Engineering Bureau, and Guo Benying, the wife of engineer Pei Shangheng, both reported to everyone in the group meeting the process of mobilizing their husbands to confess, and hoped that family members could stand firmly on the position of the working class and resolutely fight against corrupt elements.

Because the powerful force of employee family members participated in the struggle, the anti-corruption movement of the Ministry of Railways was developed universally and deeply. For example, Cao Yongfu, deputy chief of the procurement section of the Tianjin Supply Department of the Materials Bureau, was a big corrupt element who refused to confess thoroughly. However, his wife, Chen Xiulan, knew that corrupt elements could only find a way out by confessing thoroughly. Therefore, she urged Cao Yongfu three times before the deadline of February 15th. Her children, Qiusheng and Dongsheng, who were both members of the Young Pioneers, also said to Cao Yongfu:

"Our family is ashamed of your failure to confess. It is only when you confess thoroughly that you are our father." In this way, Cao Yongfu finally confessed to the fact that he had embezzled more than 170 million yuan and reported the corrupt elements related to him.

After the family members took action, a situation of internal and external attacks on corrupt elements was formed. Not only were corrupt elements under the pressure of encirclement and suppression within the organs, but they were also surrounded everywhere when they returned home. The employee family group of the Ministry of Railways at No. 4 Yangyi Hutong collected materials related to corrupt elements from all aspects every day, investigated and studied, and held meetings to discuss, and finally exposed the crimes of Wu Jie, a corrupt element living in the same courtyard. Facts have proved that family members are an indispensable force in repelling the bourgeoisie's attack. Any neglect or underestimation of this force will cause losses to our current struggle and future construction work. (Communications Group of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation)

    中央铁道部职工家属活跃在反贪污斗争的战线上
    反贪污运动在中央人民政府铁道部开展以来，铁道部的全体职工家属，在党和工会的直接领导下，积极地参加了这一伟大的阶级斗争，并且获得了很大的成绩。截至目前为止，妻子检举丈夫、劝说丈夫坦白的有三十余件，家属检举其他贪污分子的材料已达二百余件，其中包括一部分重大案件。
    在运动刚开始时，职工家属们对于这一运动的政治意义还不够明了，有人说：“反贪污是职工的事，家庭妇女管不了这些”；有人说：“我整天在家里抱孩子，没有参加工作，对情况不了解”。针对这些思想，工作组先动员家属中的一部分积极分子，在家属中进行思想酝酿。然后召开了全体职工家属动员大会，报告这一运动的意义，讲明这个运动和每个家庭的利害关系，以“今比昔”、“甜比苦”的事例来启发她们的政治觉悟。会后又召开小组座谈会，让每个人都发表自己对于这一运动的看法。有人便谈到日伪统治时期吃棒子面还要排队去买的痛苦，有人诉说了国民党统治时期，货币贬值，物价一日数涨，过不了日子。大家一致认为：
    “如今在共产党领导下，不仅物价稳定，生活也天天向上。谁好谁坏，每个人都是亲身经历过的，因此今天资产阶级要来向共产党、工人阶级进攻，想破坏我们的幸福生活，我们一定要向资产阶级反击，肃清一切贪污分子和盗窃分子。”就这样通过大小会议，家属们都普遍地认识了反对贪污是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    当全体职工家属认识了这一运动的政治意义，并表示愿意参加斗争以后，工作组又召开了第二次动员大会，反复讲明政策，解除一切可能发生的思想顾虑（如怕伤感情、怕检举出来害了亲人、怕报复等），号召她们大胆检举违法资本家及贪污分子。然后又通过原有的家属组织，由积极分子组成核心小组，逐院、逐户访问、座谈，反复宣传政策。这样动员，既普遍、又深入。不仅做到使每个家属了解政策，而且使她们都能以实际行动参加到运动中来。北门仓职工家属会上，大家采取算细账的办法，发现了贪污分子的赃证，检举了两个贪污分子；法通寺职工家属中有位老太太，亲自坐在门口观察贪污分子的行踪，终于发现了贪污分子的贪污事实，使贪污分子感到“天罗地网密布，无处可藏”。在大大小小的群众会上，职工家属们都争先恐后地检举贪污分子。
    在全体职工家属普遍参加了反贪污斗争，并取得显著成绩之后，铁道部曾召开了有一千五百多名职工家属参加的大会，宣布了前一阶段职工家属打
    “虎”的成绩，表扬了工作做得好的家属，提高大家的信心，鼓励大家再接再厉，继续检举贪污分子。这次大会，使职工家属的战斗情绪更加高涨。她们在大会后的分组讨论会上，都一致表示了打
    “虎”决心，当场就写了七十多份检举材料。徐治国的爱人在会上说：“我一定要动员我的爱人赶快彻底坦白，即使因为缴回赃款使我们的生活暂时苦些，我也情愿。如果他不坦白，我就坚决检举他！”有的家属说：“今天我们妇女翻了身，应该拿出主人翁的态度来检举贪污、盗窃分子，充分发挥自己的力量。”工程总局工程师赵寿禄的爱人许经，工程师裴尚衡的爱人郭本英，都在小组会上向大家报告了动员丈夫坦白的经过，并且希望家属们都能站稳工人阶级的立场，向贪污分子坚决斗争。
    由于职工家属这一支强大力量参加了斗争，铁道部反贪污运动得到了普遍和深入的开展。例如材料局天津供应处采购课副课长曹永福是个大贪污犯，自己不肯彻底坦白。但是他的爱人陈秀兰却知道贪污分子只有彻底坦白才有出路，因此她赶着在二月十五日的限期以前，向曹永福劝说了三次。她的孩子秋生、冬生，都是少年儿童队员，也向曹永福说：
    “我们一家人都在为你不坦白而感到耻辱，你彻底坦白才是我们的爸爸。”这样，曹永福终于坦白了贪污一亿七千多万元的事实，并检举了和他有关的贪污分子。
    家属们行动起来以后，就形成了对贪污分子的内外夹攻的形势。使贪污分子不但在机关内受到围剿的压力，回到家里也处处受到包围。洋溢胡同四号铁道部职工家属小组，她们每天都向各方面搜集有关贪污分子的材料，调查研究，开会讨论，终于使住在同院的贪污分子吴杰的罪行暴露了出来。事实证明：家属是反击资产阶级进攻的一支不可缺少的力量；如果对这个力量存有任何忽视，或估计不足，都会使我们当前的战斗和今后的建设工作受到损失。（中华全国民主妇女联合会通讯组）
