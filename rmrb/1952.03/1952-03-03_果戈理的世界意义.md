    Gogol's World Significance
    Professor Mei Yilahe, Soviet Union

    Editor's note: March 4th is the 100th anniversary of the death of the great Russian writer Gogol. On the eve of the 100th anniversary of the death of this great writer, we have specially translated Professor Mei Yilahe's article "Gogol's World Significance" and published it here together with Mr. Cao Jinghua's article.

    The 100th anniversary [Note] of the death of Gogol, one of the giants of Russian culture, is approaching. From our childhood, Gogol has entered our consciousness together with our first joys and first fantasies, with Pushkin's poems and the moving image of the motherland's nature, and with everything connected with the closest word—motherland.

    The whole world, all progressive people, will commemorate Gogol together with the Soviet people. At a recent meeting of the World Peace Council, a resolution was passed to commemorate Gogol in various countries. This resolution by the World Peace Council, a body representing the international solidarity of progressive forces, the will, inclinations and aspirations of all peace-loving peoples against the reactionary forces of imperialism, is of great significance. The resolutions passed by the Council on the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Hugo's birth, the 500th anniversary of Vinci's birth, and the 1000th anniversary of Avicenna's death also serve the cause of strengthening cultural ties between nations. The very choice of these individuals speaks volumes: people all over the world cherish those past activists who promoted the progress of their own culture and thus also promoted the progress of world culture. The genius of the Russian people—the great Gogol—belongs to this category of activists.

    The love and cherishing attitude of all ethnic groups towards the cultural treasures of the past is all the more meaningful in contrast to the behavior of the ruling groups in capitalist countries. The humanistic heritage of classical writers and the disintegrating ideas of imperialism are in such profound opposition that bourgeois critics are either forced to shout about the "old" and "bland" of classical writers, or they forge their works. The reactionary class's hatred of the excellent signs of artistic heritage has a long history. This hatred was also applied to Gogol.

    The works of this great Russian writer were translated into foreign languages ​​during his lifetime and were warmly welcomed by progressive foreign writers. In 1846, Belinsky pointed out that "Gogol's talent has won European fame," and explained that this achievement was achieved by the writer's extraordinary originality.

    Of course, Gogol's fame abroad, his influence on the creation of many foreign writers, especially Slavic writers, itself proves his world significance. But it should be considered that the actual role of a writer in cultural history cannot be measured solely by his reputation. Regardless of Gogol's reputation among readers in various countries, his world significance is determined by the actual position of his works in the history of world literature development.

    In terms of artistic culture, national and international concepts are not only not contradictory, but also inextricably linked—this is the undeniable principle in Marxist-Leninist literary science.

    Gogol—precisely because he is the expression of the genius of the Russian nation, he has made a great contribution to human artistic culture.

    In Gogol's works, the Russian life at that time is reproduced extremely deeply and movingly, embodying the great creativity of the Russian people and the outstanding characteristics of the Russian national character. Gogol is a truly inspired poet of his motherland. In his realistic and true descriptions of the people, people's customs, and people's creation, there is a fantasy confirmed by life and a lofty love for the Russian land. How much pride and joyful excitement is contained in Gogol's words to Russia: "Since you yourself are boundless, wouldn't endless thoughts arise here, in your embrace? Shouldn't outstanding heroes be born here, when there is a place for him to display and step?" Because of the great son's love for the motherland suffering in the chains of slavery, on the other hand, it also aroused hatred. Gogol used this hatred to ruthlessly expose the entire system based on the parasitic landlord class and government bureaucrats oppressing the people. He is the founder of a new school of art that truthfully depicts life and penetrates into the most secret corners of facts, human character and relationships with ruthless truth.

    The historical significance of Gogol's creation is revealed by the characteristics of the era in which he lived. The writer engaged in creation during the period when the Russian people gained rich experience from the national liberation war of 1812, which liberated the world from Napoleon's tyranny. The history of the Russian people is a history of struggle against domestic and foreign oppressors throughout the century. Nicholas I's government attempted to eradicate the revolutionary movement by persecuting the Decembrists, using barbaric means of terror, and suppressing anyone who slightly expressed a love of freedom. But the flames of peasant uprisings were still burning. Some new revolutionary groups emerged, and in the outwardly calm Russia, constant ideological work was being carried out. A generation matured, and although they could not achieve complete liberation, they were closer to the goal than their predecessors on the road to this goal.

    Centuries of serfdom and oppression have accumulated such a huge force of anger and such a huge potential for revolutionary enthusiasm in the hearts of the Russian people that once historical conditions matured, they destroyed the entire system of old Russia and established a new society. In preparing for this revolution of world historical significance, the progressive traditions of Russian culture and literature played a huge role. Great Russian literature has always been powerful in reflecting the feelings of the people and enthusiastically participating in the struggle against the oppressors.

    In Gogol's era, Belinsky's activities were the peak of the reflection of revolutionary sentiments. Gogol could not recognize the objective connection between his works and the progressive political movements of the time. Even in his best works, he did not rise to the point of depicting revolutionary struggles and calling for participation in revolutionary struggles. The final scene of one of the greatest realist works—“The Inspector General”—itself illustrates the incompleteness and contradiction of Gogol's views: in this scene he wants to point out that the officials are waiting for the revenge of the truly arrived inspector. But despite this, in Gogol's powerful exposure of all existing social order at that time, it precisely represents the interests of the people and is a reflection of the people's anger. The amazingly true picture of serfdom Russia depicted by Gogol led to a revolutionary conclusion—whether the writer wanted it or not.

    When reading Gogol's works, we can see that he believes that the most beautiful things are only those that are related to the world of the people's intentions, desires and imagination.

    The popularity of Gogol's works can be seen in his early works. Gogol declared new creative principles in the preface to the book "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka". In the book, Panko the Beekeeper made a sharp contrast between his position, his style, his writing style, and the aristocratic literary style of the "landlord" who despised the "farmer." Panko the Beekeeper, in refuting the opponent who contemptuously criticized the beekeeper and his story, said: "...We buddies, peasants, walking from our remote places to high society - Good heavens! - it's as if it sometimes disturbs the peace of the masters in the same way: everyone surrounds you, fools you... people start stamping their feet from all directions. 'Where are you going? Where are you going? What's going on? Go, peasant, go away!……'" Subsequently, the reader is immediately introduced into the atmosphere of people's creation and people's customs; even the tone of the storyteller is the living people's language, and the directness and vividness of this tone is unprecedented in past literature.

    In "Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka", the reader is presented with the joyful world of rich life pleasures of ordinary people. In this world, realism and high romanticism are closely unified, and the prose of daily life is also true poetry. In the novella "Mirgorod", Gogol depicts other aspects of life - the pre-reform manor ("Old World Landowners"), the vulgar and boring life of the town ("The Quarrel of the Two Ivans"), and a clear contrast to this life is the history of national heroes ("Taras Bulba"). In the stories about St. Petersburg, the contrast between "upper" and "lower", poor and rich, is very strongly expressed. The reader is presented with the images of various petty citizens, small handicraftsmen, and small officials who are destined to suffer poverty by the social system and are destined to perish in this world full of fraud, hypocrisy and cruelty. Starting from these novels, the reader directly reaches the genius artistic generalization—the novella "The Overcoat". The life of Akakiy Akakiyevich is a social tragedy arising from typical situations; in exposing this tragedy, Gogol established new democratic humanistic ideas. In "The Inspector General" and "Dead Souls", the logic of image development itself exposes the essence of all feudal-serfdom and the budding capitalist relations.

    Gogol's criticism is so influential because behind his criticism there is a huge positive content, an understanding of the characteristics of the Russian people—these characteristics determine their fearlessness and their strong and unyielding hatred of oppressors. The writer powerfully embodies these characteristics in the epic heroic image of Taras Bulba: "Can there be such flames, pain and strength exceeding Russia in the world?"

    The power of Gogol's realism lies in his ruthless exposure of the representatives of serfdom and bureaucratic Russia, the "survivors" and "acquirers". The artist exposed the typical representatives of the old serfdom Russia, but the power of his artistic generalization is so great that the types he depicted have gained international significance. The parasitism of the ruling class, the oppression of the working people, the most cruel and ugly deeds that are hypocritically covered up with "kind words"—all of this is unique to landlords and capitalists. With subtle and skillful techniques, Gogol not only exposed the laws of social behavior, but also exposed the various psychological states of people like Chichikov, Sobakevich, Manilov, Plyushkin and Rostrev. In order to expose these types, the writer used the weapon of satire that he mastered very skillfully.

    Gogol said: "Ridicule is a great thing. It cannot take life or manor, but the guilty person is like a bound rabbit in front of it."

    Gogol, the great artist who hated the serf owners with all his life, did not hate the servants of the Yellow Devil City (referring to the United States - translator's note), which Gorky called decades later, any less. In Gogol's works, we see his criticism of the sinister essence of the power of cash, the shameless self-interest calculation, and the various activities that become tools for getting rich - including artistic creation activities. In the novella "The Portrait", he describes the story of a painter who was tempted by money and thus turned his creation into a commodity.

    Gogol's image, due to the depth of typification, has maintained its exposing power throughout the 19th century, and will be preserved until the property relations that produced them and the remnants of these relations die out. Lenin and Stalin used Gogol's satirical images to expose the faces of various enemies of the proletariat, revealing the further development of those parasitic characteristics that the great writer denounced under different historical conditions.

    From this, we can understand the falsity of the assertion of bourgeois critics that Gogol's satirical image only has revealing significance for Russia. In fact, these images still retain their striking power for exposing the ruling class of modern capitalist countries in Western Europe and America. Chernyshevsky talked about in "An Outline of Russian Literature in the Gogol Era" that "in France and everywhere else, there are their Manilovs and Chichikovs," Germany "has many people like Manilov," and in England "Chichikovs operate factories and stock exchange activities." In capitalist countries, the contrast between the wealth of the privileged upper class and the poverty of the people, and the insult to the "little people" that Gogol denounced in his novels, are many times greater.

    Gogol's great contribution to the development of Russian literature and world literature also lies in the innovative and unique artistic form of his works. He, and only he, can combine touching lyricism and extensive epic, solemnity and sorrow, angry scolding and gentle mockery into a unique and complete unity. Those clearly portrayed images will forever remain in the reader's memory, because they combine the sharpness of the typical characteristics of the characters and their unique personal characteristics. Each of Gogol's characters has his own "speaking" style. Gogol used the treasure house of the Russian language with amazing changes. According to the writer, the Russian language includes "all tones, and at the same time, in the same sentence, includes the boldest transition from high to simple." Following Pushkin, Gogol continued to develop the Russian literary language, and in his works made the people's rich and flexible language richer. At the same time, Gogol ridiculed the trendy words of the landlords and upper-class ladies who slavishly worshiped all foreign things, as well as the bureaucratic and all other phrases that were hostile to the national language.

    The spiritual tragedy that occurred in Gogol's later years is of profound educational significance. The history of this period proves that if an artist falls under the domination of ideas that are hostile to the people, even talent cannot save him. Gogol suffered the greatest losses in thought and creation because he was under the influence of these stubborn reactionaries: such as Baggodin, Shviylev and Yazekov. In "Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends", he defended the autocracy and serfdom, praising these "foundations" that all his previous works had opposed. In his famous letter to Gogol, Belinsky gave an angry rebuttal to Gogol's reactionary work. According to Lenin, this letter "is one of the best works of the uncensored democratic press, and it still maintains great vivid significance today." The break with progressive Russia also led to Gogol's creative tragedy: the failure of the second part of "Dead Souls" (although there are also very good realist sections).

    However, when talking about Gogol's later years, it is necessary to resolutely defeat the argument of reactionary critics: saying that "Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends" is the regular path of the writer's development. His artistic creation and the outline of "Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends" have nothing in common. Gogol was a victim of his most ferocious enemy—the feudal serf reactionary faction—but the merits of this genius realist to the Russian people and all progressive mankind are immortal.

    A century has passed since Gogol's death. The entire life of the country that he loved so much and praised in the moving parts of his creation has been completely changed. The Russia that Gogol compared to the "troika" that was constantly running forward and could not be caught up has become the first socialist power on earth with amazing speed. A new song full of struggle and labor joy is floating on the vast land of the Soviet land. Chanting these songs are millions of people in remote foreign places; they are united to protect the cause of freedom, culture and peace from the modern Chichikovs, Rostrevs and Sobakevichs from across the ocean.

    果戈理的世界意义
    苏联  梅伊拉赫教授
    编者按：三月四日是俄国伟大作家果戈理的一百周年忌辰。在这位伟大作家逝世一百周年纪念日的前夕，我们特译了苏联梅伊拉赫教授“果戈理的世界意义”一文，和曹靖华先生所写的文章同时发表在这里。
    俄国文化巨匠之一果戈理逝世的一百周年纪念日〔注〕已经临近了。从我们幼年时起，果戈理就和我们最初的欢乐及最初的幻想，和普希金的诗句及祖国自然界的动人形象，和最亲近的字眼——祖国联系着的一切，共同进入了我们的意识。
    全世界，全体进步人士都将和苏联人民一齐来纪念果戈理。在世界和平理事会最近的一次会议上，通过了在各国纪念果戈理的决议。世界和平理事会是一个代表热烈关怀进步力量的国际团结、反对帝国主义反动势力的全体爱好和平民族的意志、倾向和渴望的团体，它的这个决议是具有非常重大的意义的。该会所通过的关于纪念雨果诞生一百五十周年，芬奇诞生五百周年以及阿维森纳逝世一千周年的决议，也是服务于加强各民族间的文化联系事业的。这几个人的选择本身就说明了许多事情：世界人民珍贵那些促进本国文化进步因而也促进世界文化进步的过去的活动家们。俄国人民的天才——伟大的果戈理，就是属于这类的活动家的。
    各族人民对于过去文化宝藏的爱惜和珍重态度，在资本主义国家统治集团的行为的对比下，更显得意味深长。古典作家的人道主义的遗产和帝国主义的分崩离析的思想处于这样深刻的对立状态，因此资产阶级的批评家们或者被迫喊叫古典作家的“陈腐”、“淡而无味”，或者就伪造他们的创作。反动阶级对于艺术遗产的优秀标志的仇恨，早已具有长期的历史。这种仇恨也曾施于果戈理的身上。
    这位伟大的俄国作家的创作，还在他生前就已译成了外国文字，并受到外国进步的文学家的热烈欢迎。一八四六年，柏林斯基曾指出，“果戈理的才能博得了欧洲的声誉”，同时并说明这种成就是作家的非凡的独创性所获得的。
    当然，果戈理在国外所享的盛名，他对于许多外国作家创作的影响，尤其是对于斯拉夫作家的创作的影响，本身就已证明了他的世界意义。但是应该考虑到仅以某一个作家的声望，远不能衡量他在文化史中的实际作用。不管果戈理在各国读者间的声誉如何，他的世界意义是由他的创作在世界文学发展史中所占的实际地位而定。
    在艺术文化方面，民族的和国际的概念不仅互相毫不抵触，而且是不可分割地联系着的——这是马克思列宁主义文艺科学中无可争辩的原理。
    果戈理——正因为他是俄国民族的天才表现者，所以他对人类艺术文化有巨大的贡献。
    在果戈理的作品中，异常深刻而动人地重现出当时的俄国生活，体现出俄国人民的伟大创造力和俄国民族性的卓越特点。果戈理是他的祖国的一位真正赋有灵感的诗人。在他对人民、人民习惯和人民创造的现实主义的真实描写中，流露着为生活所证实的幻想和对俄国土地的崇高热爱。在果戈理对俄国所讲的话中，含有多少骄傲和快乐的激动啊：“你自己既然是浩无边际的，在这里，在你的怀抱里还会不产生无穷尽的思想吗？难道这里还不应该生育出杰出的英雄来吗，当这里有他可以施展和迈步的地方时？”由于对在奴隶制锁链中受苦的母亲——祖国，有着伟大的儿子的爱，在另一方面也就唤起了憎恨。果戈理就以这种憎恨无情地揭穿了基于寄生的地主阶级和政府官僚压迫人民的现存关系的全部制度。他是一个新艺术学派的奠基者，这个学派真实地描写了生活，以无情的真实深入到事实、人类性格和关系的最秘密的角落。
    果戈理创作的历史意义，是由他所处的时代的特征上显露出来的。作家从事创作，是在俄国人民从一八一二年的民族解放战争中获得了丰富经验的时期，这次战争使全世界从拿破仑的暴政下获得解放。俄国人民的历史，是整个世纪反对国内外压迫者的斗争史。尼古拉一世的政府，企图以迫害十二月党人、野蛮的恐怖手段和对稍微吐露爱好自由的人施以镇压，来根除革命运动。但是农民暴动的烈焰依然在燃烧。一些新的革命小组产生了，在外表风平浪静的俄国，进行着不断的思想工作。有一代人成熟了，他们虽然还不能达到完全解放，但是在向这个目标进行的路程上，已经较他们的先辈更加接近了目标。
    农奴制度和压迫的诸世纪，在俄国人民心中积蓄了这样巨大的愤怒力量，这样巨大的革命热情的潜力，一旦历史条件成熟时，它们就摧毁了旧俄全部制度并建立起新的社会。在准备这次具有世界历史意义的革命中，俄国文化和文学的进步传统，起了巨大作用。伟大的俄国文学在反映人民的心情并热烈地参加对压迫者的斗争方面，永远是有力的。
    在果戈理的时代，柏林斯基的活动是革命情绪反映的高峰。果戈理不能认识到他的作品和当时进步的政治运动的客观联系。甚至在他最优秀的作品中，他也没有提高到描写革命斗争和号召参加革命斗争。最伟大的现实主义作品之一——“巡按”——的最后一场，本身就说明了果戈理的观点的不彻底性和自相矛盾：在这一场他想指明等候着官员们的是真正来到的巡按的报复。但是虽然如此，在果戈理对当时一切现存的社会秩序的有力的揭发中，正是代表了人民的利益同时是人民愤怒的反映。果戈理所描绘出来的农奴制俄国的真实得惊人的图画，导向了革命的结论——不管作家是否愿意这样。
    当读果戈理的作品时，我们看出，他认为最美丽的事物只是那些和人民的意图、渴望和想像的世界相联系着的。
    果戈理的创作的民众性，在他的初期作品中即已看出。果戈理曾在“狄肯加邻村的夜晚”一书的序言中，声明过新的创作原则。书中的潘科·鲁对依把自己的地位、自己的风格、自己的文体和鄙视“农夫”的、“地主”的老爷式的文学风格，做了一个尖锐的对比。潘科·鲁对依在反驳那轻蔑地批评养蜂人及其故事的敌手时说：“……我们哥儿们，庄稼人，从我们的偏僻地方走到上流社会去——老天爷！——这就好像有时候扰乱了大老爷的安静一模一样：大家围住你、愚弄你……四面八方都开始跺脚。‘到那里去？到那里去？怎么回事？去，庄稼汉，走开！……’”随后，读者就立刻被引入了人民的创作和人民的习惯的气氛中去；甚至说故事的人的语调，都是活生生的人民语言，这种语调的直接和生动，是过去文学中所未曾有过的。
    在“狄肯加邻村的夜晚”中，读者面前呈现出普通人的富有人生乐趣的快乐世界。在这个世界中，现实主义和高度的浪漫主义密切地统一着，日常生活的散文同时也是真正的诗句。在中篇小说“密尔格拉得”中，果戈理描绘出生活的其他方面——改革前的庄园（“斯塔罗斯维特的地主”），乡镇的庸俗而无聊的生活（“两个伊万的吵架”），和这种生活成一个鲜明对比的，是人民英雄的历史（“塔拉斯·布尔巴”）。在关于彼得堡的小说中，“上层”和“下层”、穷和富的对比，非常强烈地表现了出来。读者面前所呈现出的有各种小市民、小手工业者、小官员的形象，这些人被社会制度注定要遭受贫穷，注定要在这个充满欺诈、伪善和残酷的世界中灭亡。由这些小说出发直接达到了天才的艺术概括——中篇小说“外套”。阿卡吉依·阿卡吉耶维奇的生活，是由典型的情况中所产生的社会悲剧；果戈理在揭发这个悲剧时，确定了新的、民主的人道主义观念。而在“巡按”和“死魂灵”中，形象发展的逻辑本身，就揭穿了全部封建——农奴制和刚刚萌芽的资产阶级关系的实质。
    果戈理的批判主义之所以具有这样的影响力，因为他的批判主义后面有巨大的正面的内容，有对俄国人民性格特点的理解——这些特点确定了他们的无畏和对压迫者的坚强不屈的憎恨。作家把这些特点非常有力地体现在史诗的英雄形象塔拉斯·布尔巴中：“世界上难道还能找到这样的火焰、痛苦和能超过俄国的这样的力量吗？”
    果戈理的现实主义的力量，在于他无情地揭穿了农奴制和官僚主义的俄国代表、“生存者”和“获得者”。艺术家揭穿了旧的农奴制俄国的典型代表，但是他的艺术概括的力量是这样巨大，因而使他所描写的典型获得了国际意义。统治阶级的寄生性，劳动人民所受的压迫，用“善良的词句”虚伪地遮盖起来的最残酷和最丑恶的勾当——这一切对于地主和资本家来说，都是他们所特有的。果戈理以细致巧妙的技巧，不仅揭发了社会行为法则，而且还揭发出乞乞科夫、梭巴开维奇、玛尼罗夫、泼留什金和罗士特来夫之流的各种心理状态。为了揭露这类典型，作家利用了他掌握的非常巧妙的讽刺武器。
    果戈理说过：“嘲笑是件伟大的事情，它既夺不了生命，也夺不了庄园，但是有罪的人在它面前就像一只被缚起的兔子。”
    果戈理，这位以全部生命憎恨农奴主的伟大艺术家，对于几十年以后高尔基称之为黄鬼城（指美国——译者注）的仆役的人们，也并不稍少憎恨。在果戈理的作品中，我们看到他对于现金支配权、无耻的自私自利的算盘和变成致富工具的各种活动过程——包括艺术创作活动在内——的凶恶实质的批评。在中篇小说“肖像”中，他描述了一个画家受了金钱的诱惑因而使自己的创作变成了商品的堕落故事。
    果戈理的形象，由于典型化的深刻，在十九世纪整个时期都保持着揭发力量，同时还会保存到当产生他们的财产关系和这些关系的残余死去的时候为止。列宁和斯大林利用果戈理的讽刺形象，揭穿着无产阶级的各种敌人的嘴脸，揭示出伟大的作家所痛斥的那些寄生特点在不同的历史条件下的进一步发展情形。
    由此即可了解资产阶级批评家认为果戈理的讽刺形象仅对俄国具有揭露性意义这一论断的虚伪性。事实上，这些形象对于揭露西欧和美洲的现代资本主义国家的统治阶级，是保存着其打击的力量的。车尔尼雪夫斯基在“果戈理时代俄国文学概略”中曾谈到，“在法国和在其他各地一样，都有他们的玛尼罗夫们和乞乞科夫们”，德国“有很多玛尼罗夫一类的人”，而在英国“乞乞科夫们经营着工厂和交易所的勾当”。在资本主义国家中，特权上层的豪富和人民的贫穷的对比，以及果戈理在自己的小说中所斥责的那种对“小人物”的侮辱，是大到许多倍的。
    果戈理在俄国文学和世界文学发展中的伟大贡献，也在于他的作品的革新的特殊独创的艺术形式。他，只有他能够把感人心腑的抒情和广博的叙事诗，把庄严和哀愁，把愤怒的嘲骂和温婉的嘲弄，结合成独特的完整的统一。那些清晰刻划的形象，会永远留在读者的记忆里，因为其中结合着人物们的典型特点的锐利性和他们个人独特的性格。果戈理的每个人物，都有他自己的“谈吐”风格。果戈理以惊人的变化运用了俄国的语言宝库。照作家的话来说，俄国语言中包括着“一切音调，同时在同一句话中，包括着由高昂到简单的最大胆的转变”。果戈理继普希金之后继续发展着俄国文学语言，在他的作品中使人民的丰富而灵活的语言更加丰富起来。同时果戈理嘲笑了对一切外国事物奴颜卑膝的地主和上流社会的太太们的流行语，以及官僚的和一切其他敌视全民语言的辞句。
    具有深刻教育意义的，是发生在果戈理晚年的精神悲剧。这个时期的历史证明，一个艺术家如果落在敌视人民的思想支配下，甚至天赋的才能也无法拯救他。果戈理由于处在这些顽固的反动者：如包果金、什维列夫和雅则科夫的影响之下，在思想上和创作上遭受了最大的损失。在“通信选集”中，他曾为专制制度和农奴制辩护，赞扬这些他以前的全部创作所曾反对过的“基础”。柏林斯基在给果戈理的著名的信中，对果戈理的这部反动作品给与了愤怒的驳斥。按照列宁的话，这封信“是未被检查的民主派出版界的优秀作品之一，它在今天还保持着巨大的生动意义”。和进步的俄国的破裂，也导致了果戈理的创作悲剧：“死魂灵”第二部的失败（虽然其中也有很好的现实主义的篇幅）。
    然而，谈到果戈理的晚年时，需要坚决击退反动批评家的这一论证：说什么“通信选集”是作家发展的规律道路。他的艺术创作和“通信选集”的提纲完全没有任何相同之处。果戈理是他最凶恶的敌人——封建农奴反动派——的牺牲品，但是这位天才的现实主义者对俄国人民和全体进步人类的功绩是不朽的。
    从果戈理逝世到现在已经整整一个世纪了。他曾这样爱过的国家、用他的创作的动人的篇幅歌颂过的这个国家的全部生活，都已彻底改变了。果戈理比喻为不停向前奔驰的、赶不上的“三驾马车”的那个俄国，已经以神奇的速度成为地球上第一个社会主义强国了。充满了战斗和劳动的快乐的新歌，飘荡在苏维埃土地一望无际的辽阔地面上。合唱着这些歌的，有国外遥远地方的数以百万计的人们；他们为了保卫自由、文化与和平事业使之不受海洋彼岸现代的乞乞科夫、罗士特来夫和梭巴开维奇的侵犯而团结起来了。（君强译自苏联文学报一月二十六日）
