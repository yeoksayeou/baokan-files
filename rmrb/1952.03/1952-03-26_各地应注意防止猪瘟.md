    All Regions Should Pay Attention to Preventing Swine Fever
    Swine fever has occurred in Yongxing Village and Huishen Village in the fourth district of Qi County, Shanxi Province. The swine fever in Yongxing Village was discovered in early February, and within twenty days, twenty-two pigs (four large pigs and eighteen piglets) had died. There are still four fat pigs sick. The symptoms of swine fever in this village are: inability to raise their heads, reluctance to move, swaying of the buttocks, little appetite, fondness for drinking cold water, and dry and yellow stools and urine. The diseased pigs died in about twenty days. The village has begun to accept the guidance of veterinarians sent by the special commissioner's office to isolate the healthy pigs from the sick pigs and implement prevention and control measures. This phenomenon should be brought to the attention of all regions.

    各地应注意防止猪瘟
    山西祁县四区永兴庄、会善村等地发生猪瘟。永兴庄的猪瘟是在二月初发现的，不到二十天就死了大小猪二十二只（大猪四只、小猪十八只），现在还有四只肥猪在病着。这个村所发生的猪瘟病象是：抬不起头来，不爱行动、臀部左右摆动、吃食很少、爱喝冷水和大便干燥、小便发黄等。染病的猪差不多二十天就死了。这个村已开始接受专署派来的兽医的指导，把好猪和病猪实行隔离并加防治。这一现象是应该引起各地普遍注意的。
