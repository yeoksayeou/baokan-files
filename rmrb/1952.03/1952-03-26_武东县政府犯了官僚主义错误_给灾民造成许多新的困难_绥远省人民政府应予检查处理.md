    Wudong County Government Commits Bureaucratic Errors, Causing Many New Difficulties for Disaster Victims; Suiyuan Provincial People's Government Should Investigate and Handle

    To the Editor: The Wudong County People's Government in Suiyuan Province has committed intolerable bureaucratic errors in leading production and disaster relief work, causing serious losses in manpower, material resources, and the starvation of cattle among disaster victims.

    Last year, the disaster situation in this county was extremely serious, with an average harvest of less than 30% of crops, and many villages in the Third and Fourth Districts did not even recover their seeds. Under these circumstances, the Wudong County People's Government should have actively led farmers to engage in production for self-relief and overcome the severe disaster. However, the county government demonstrated extremely serious bureaucracy in many aspects of its work, further increasing the difficulties of the disaster victims.

    I. The county government repeatedly and blindly organized the masses to go out, aggravating the difficulties of the disaster victims. In October of last year, the Wudong County People's Government formulated a work-for-relief method, mobilizing farmers to build the Tao(lin)-Ji(ning) Highway. The county government did not consult with the Special Commissioner's Office beforehand, and notified the laborers of the Fourth District to gather at Tuchengzi in Jining County. After hundreds of laborers rushed to the construction site, they learned that the construction of this road was not planned to include laborers from Wudong County. The laborers had no choice but to sell their tools and clothes to pay for their return trip. Not long after this incident, the Wudong County People's Government again notified the Third District to organize the disaster victims' carts to transport goods to the Baotou Coal Mine. Because the county government had not coordinated well with the coal mine, the disaster victims who went to haul goods had to sell their belongings to pay for their travel expenses and returned with empty carts. The disaster victims' reaction to these events was: "They didn't help us, but harmed us instead."

    II. Relief grain was stored until it spoiled before being distributed to the disaster victims. Due to the long-term storage of relief grain allocated by the central government, the Wudong County People's Government caused the phenomenon of moldy grain. Among them, 10,000 catties of sorghum flour were distributed after it had already spoiled.

    III. In employing the vehicles of disaster victims, the regulations were not followed. In February of this year, the Wudong County People's Government received a large amount of seed loan from the central government. In order to take care of the disaster victims in the severely affected areas (Third and Fourth Districts), the county government stipulated that "the travel expenses for hauling seeds in the Third and Fourth Districts will be paid by the government." However, when the seventy carts hauling seeds from the Fourth District arrived at Qixiaying, the cadres of the Construction Section actually denied the above provision. Only after repeated requests from the disaster victims hauling seeds, and after dragging on for three or four days, did the government lend them some travel expenses. Forty carts from the Third District, according to the notice from the county government, went to the Longsheng County Grain Company to haul seeds, but because of changes in the plan, they also made a trip for nothing.

    IV. Cadres sent to the countryside to inspect work lead corrupt lives and cannot help disaster victims through the famine in a timely manner. At present, the disaster situation in Wudong County is extremely serious, but the county government only shouts empty slogans about doing a good job in production and disaster relief, and cannot truly solve the problem. Some of the cadres sent down to inspect work lead corrupt lives, so that not only have they not reduced the threat of disaster to the masses, but they have instead promoted the development of the disaster situation to become even more serious. Due to the widespread lack of grass to eat, the cattle in the Third and Fourth Districts are so starved that they cannot move, and by the end of February, more than 400 head had died.

    Editor's Note: The bureaucratic style of some cadres in the Wudong County People's Government is extremely serious. They not only did not help the disaster victims overcome their difficulties, but also caused unnecessary losses to the disaster victims. This is absolutely unacceptable. It is hoped that the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government will promptly investigate and handle this matter.

    武东县政府犯了官僚主义错误
    给灾民造成许多新的困难
    绥远省人民政府应予检查处理
    编辑同志：绥远省武东县人民政府，在领导生产救灾工作中，犯了不可容忍的官僚主义错误，造成浪费灾民人力、物力和饿死耕牛的严重损失。
    这个县去年灾情十分严重，农作物平均不到三成收成，三、四区很多村庄甚至连籽种都没有收回。在这一情况下，武东县人民政府本来应该积极领导农民生产自救，战胜严重灾荒。但该县人民政府在许多工作中表现了极严重的官僚主义，使灾民的困难更为增加。
    一、县人民政府一再盲目组织群众外出，加重灾民的困难。去年十月，武东县人民政府订出以工代赈办法，动员农民修筑陶（林）集（宁）公路。县人民政府事前并没有和专署商妥，就通知四区民工到集宁县土城子集合。几百个民工赶到工地以后，才知道修筑这条路并没有计划武东县的民工参加。民工只好卖掉工具、衣服做路费返回去。在这件事情发生不久，武东县人民政府又通知三区把灾民的大车组织起来，到包头炭矿拉脚。由于县人民政府和炭矿没有联系好，前往拉脚的灾民只得变卖东西做路费，拉着空车回来。灾民对这些事情的反映是：没有救了咱，反害了咱。
    二、把救济粮积压坏了才发给灾民。武东县人民政府由于长期积压中央拨给的救济粮，以致发生霉坏粮食现象。其中有一万斤高粱面是在坏了以后才发放下去的。
    三、在雇用灾民车辆时，不按规定办事。今年二月，武东县人民政府领到中央大批籽种贷款。为了照顾重灾区（三、四区）的灾民，县人民政府规定“三、四区拉籽种的路费由政府付给”，但是四区拉籽种的七十辆大车到旗下营时，建设科的干部竟否认上项规定。经过拉籽种的灾民再三要求，并且拖了三、四天后，政府才借给一部路费。三区四十辆大车根据县人民政府通知到龙胜县粮食公司拉籽种时，因为计划有了变动，也空跑了一趟。
    四、下乡检查工作的干部生活腐化，不能及时帮助灾民度荒。目前武东县灾情十分严重，但县人民政府只是空喊要做好生产救灾工作，不能真正解决问题。派下去检查工作的若干干部，生活腐化，以致不但没有减轻灾害对群众的威胁，反而促使灾情发展更趋严重。三、四区的耕牛由于普遍没有草吃，都饿得不能行动了，到二月底已死了四百多头。

    编者按：武东县人民政府某些干部的官僚主义作风十分严重，他们不仅没有帮助灾民克服了困难，反而给灾民造成了不应有的损失。这是绝对不能容许的。希望绥远省人民政府迅速加以检查处理。
