    [This newspaper reports] The Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, originally scheduled for late April, has been postponed to June with the approval of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference because the "Five-Anti" movement is developing unevenly in various cities, and some areas are finding it difficult to produce representatives on schedule.
