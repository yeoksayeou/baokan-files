    Shanghai Reverses Slow Progress in Anti-Corruption Struggle; Further Mobilizes the Masses to Round Up Corrupt Elements
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Xinhua News Agency: After vigorously overcoming right-leaning thought, the anti-corruption struggle in Shanghai's government organs has begun to change. The results of the second campaign, which lasted until February 24, were approximately three times those of the first campaign.
    The achievements of the second anti-corruption campaign in Shanghai are inseparable from the resolute correction of various right-leaning ideas. For example, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau was a very backward unit before February 20. Since Mayor Chen Yi made a report opposing right-leaning thought and removed Cao Manzhi, the director of the bureau, for his ineffective leadership of the movement, all the staff members greatly increased their confidence in the struggle, criticized their own right-leaning ideas, and re-formulated their combat plans. The movement unfolded rapidly, and as a result, they overfulfilled the planned combat tasks of the second campaign. In order to strengthen the political work of the anti-corruption struggle, the Shanghai Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee stipulated that each unit should arrange political work at the same time as deploying tasks, and regard political work as one of the criteria for assessing the achievements of each unit.
    After summarizing the experience of the second campaign, the Shanghai Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee convened a meeting of cadres above the level of squadron leader from all units participating in the encirclement and suppression of corrupt elements on February 25 to deploy the combat tasks for the third campaign. Chen Yi, the Mayor of Shanghai, emphasized in his summary: Although the second campaign has achieved considerable results, and the state of slowness and backwardness has begun to reverse, we cannot be satisfied with these preliminary achievements, but should continue to make the greatest efforts to resolutely and thoroughly overcome "right-leaning" thought, and prevent the re-emergence of new right-leaning thought on the current basis. It is necessary to better master and apply tactics, further strengthen organizations at all levels, further mobilize the masses and strengthen political work, and further implement planned operations, in order to strive for greater victories in the third campaign.

    上海市扭转反贪污斗争的迟缓状态
    进一步发动群众围剿贪污犯
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：在大力克服右倾思想之后，上海市机关反贪污斗争已开始改观。截至二月二十四日为止的第二战役，其战果约等于第一战役的三倍。
    上海市反贪污斗争第二战役战果的获得是和坚决纠正各种右倾思想分不开的。例如上海市人民政府民政局在二月二十日以前是很落后的一个单位。自从陈毅市长作了反对右倾思想的报告，并撤掉了领导运动不力的该局局长曹漫之以后，全体工作人员斗争信心倍增，纷纷批判了自己的右倾思想，重新拟定作战计划，运动迅速展开，结果超额完成了第二战役的预定作战任务。为了加强反贪污斗争的政治工作，上海市增产节约委员会规定各单位在布置任务时应同时布置政治工作，并把政治工作作为考核各单位成绩的标准之一。
    上海市增产节约委员会在总结了第二个战役的经验后，在二月二十五日召集围剿贪污分子的各路大军中队长以上干部，布置了第三个战役的战斗任务。上海市人民政府市长陈毅在作总结时强调指出：第二个战役虽然成绩不小，迟缓落后状态虽已开始扭转，但我们不能满足于这些初步的成绩，而应该继续以最大的努力，坚决地彻底地克服“右倾”思想，并防止在目前基础上再产生新的右倾思想。要更好地掌握和运用战术，更进一步地加强各级组织，更进一步地发动群众和加强政治工作，更进一步地实行有计划的作战，为争取第三个战役的更大的胜利而奋斗。
