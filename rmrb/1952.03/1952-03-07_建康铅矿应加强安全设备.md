    Jiankang Lead Mine Should Strengthen Safety Equipment

    Comrade Editor: Last September, an accident occurred at the Jiankang Lead Mine in Hunan, where the collapse of a tunnel injured worker Li Zhengwen; however, the leadership did not learn from this lesson and improve safety equipment. This January, worker Lu Xianfa, from the cooperative shed tunnel, fell from a high tunnel into a low tunnel, suffering serious injuries. If the railings in the tunnel had been repaired beforehand, this accident could have been avoided. Therefore, I suggest that the leadership of Jiankang Lead Mine immediately strengthen safety equipment and conduct safety education for workers. Wildfire

    建康铅矿应加强安全设备
    编辑同志：去年九月，湖南建康铅矿曾发生洞子倒塌压伤工人李正文的事故；但领导方面并没有接受教训，改进安全设备。今年一月，合作棚洞子工人卢先发，从高洞子跌入低洞子，受伤很重。如果事先把洞子里的栏杆修好，这次事故是可以避免的。因此，我建议建康铅矿领导方面立即加强安全设备，并对工人进行安全教育。 野火
